00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.840
 hello together with the film factory that 

00:00:01.949 --> 00:00:06.390
 is now the couch classic for science 

00:00:03.840 --> 00:00:09.450
 fiction movie prometheus and one 

00:00:06.390 --> 00:00:12.840
 prometheus some researchers travel in 

00:00:09.450 --> 00:00:15.870
 year 2000 93 into the universe around the 

00:00:12.840 --> 00:00:16.800
 origin of mankind to discover 

00:00:15.870 --> 00:00:19.380
 At first it does not sound that way 

00:00:16.800 --> 00:00:21.810
 exciting but in advance were namely 

00:00:19.380 --> 00:00:24.180
 all characters discover all 

00:00:21.810 --> 00:00:25.500
 suggest that there is one somewhere 

00:00:24.180 --> 00:00:27.980
 point in the universe is where 

00:00:25.500 --> 00:00:30.840
 maybe just the first human 

00:00:27.980 --> 00:00:32.520
 somehow been born and but 

00:00:30.840 --> 00:00:35.100
 They expose him to this expedition 

00:00:32.520 --> 00:00:37.110
 that at one time not just one 

00:00:35.100 --> 00:00:39.239
 Expedition are but in a fight 

00:00:37.110 --> 00:00:43.850
 and therefore also in danger 

00:00:39.239 --> 00:00:43.850
 how the whole looks here in the trader 

00:00:49.910 --> 00:00:59.390
 a king rules and then he dies 

00:01:01.350 --> 00:01:04.830
 that is inevitable 

00:01:10.540 --> 00:01:16.380
 heard disappointing 

00:01:13.470 --> 00:01:18.600
 These are ancient civilizations between 

00:01:16.380 --> 00:01:20.040
 they lay for centuries and there 

00:01:18.600 --> 00:01:22.830
 you do the same in every single one 

00:01:20.040 --> 00:01:25.770
 Pictogram smile I believe you 

00:01:22.830 --> 00:01:27.270
 We are happy to find you here 

00:01:25.770 --> 00:01:29.580
 because of the card here you two in the 

00:01:27.270 --> 00:01:33.800
 cave found no map 

00:01:29.580 --> 00:01:33.800
 an invitation from whom 

00:01:35.820 --> 00:01:40.079
 please tell her that she can read this 

00:01:43.340 --> 00:01:57.600
 Prometheus you see that whatever 

00:01:55.590 --> 00:02:00.840
 the sun that registers it is one 

00:01:57.600 --> 00:02:03.479
 how do you mean the life form? 

00:02:00.840 --> 00:02:07.049
 change over us change them 

00:02:03.479 --> 00:02:10.300
 These things move in masses 

00:02:07.049 --> 00:02:14.130
 move what is that 

00:02:10.300 --> 00:02:16.440
 that's her break up 

00:02:14.130 --> 00:02:19.070
 to the earth we have 

00:02:16.440 --> 00:02:19.070
 made fault 

00:02:20.000 --> 00:02:24.200
 have this 

00:02:22.430 --> 00:02:26.430
 struggling with 

00:02:24.200 --> 00:02:29.090
 these are allowed 

00:02:26.430 --> 00:02:29.090
 on the one hand 

00:02:46.560 --> 00:02:51.480
 Big things have a small origin 

00:02:51.870 --> 00:02:57.040
 in this film you have to first beforehand 

00:02:54.430 --> 00:02:59.769
 Once you pay attention to how to get this movie 

00:02:57.040 --> 00:03:01.569
 because just when the cinemas came 

00:02:59.769 --> 00:03:03.190
 this year it is the prehistory of 

00:03:01.569 --> 00:03:04.810
 alien or this one on the other side 

00:03:03.190 --> 00:03:06.459
 No, that's not how it is 

00:03:04.810 --> 00:03:08.739
 is just so another told branch up 

00:03:06.459 --> 00:03:09.879
 it has nothing to do with it and it 

00:03:08.739 --> 00:03:11.440
 is actually best when you're in 

00:03:09.879 --> 00:03:12.940
 film looks and first think it 

00:03:11.440 --> 00:03:14.829
 actually has nothing to do with it 

00:03:12.940 --> 00:03:18.040
 then you get one really 

00:03:14.829 --> 00:03:20.319
 Perfectly designed down to the smallest detail 

00:03:18.040 --> 00:03:23.079
 science fiction film so I have to say 

00:03:20.319 --> 00:03:24.370
 so set design and optics and the whole 

00:03:23.079 --> 00:03:27.519
 there was a lot in the last 

00:03:24.370 --> 00:03:30.730
 rarely convince so stylish 

00:03:27.519 --> 00:03:32.140
 and so razor sharp in a movie too 

00:03:30.730 --> 00:03:34.540
 I really have to say that's easy 

00:03:32.140 --> 00:03:36.190
 good three times that looks really good 

00:03:34.540 --> 00:03:38.290
 besides, here are also really 

00:03:36.190 --> 00:03:39.730
 many well-known actors also 

00:03:38.290 --> 00:03:43.500
 now a charlize theron michael 

00:03:39.730 --> 00:03:45.849
 Fassbender or here noomi rapace the 

00:03:43.500 --> 00:03:47.379
 Everything works and you are 

00:03:45.849 --> 00:03:50.260
 once again glad that such movies with 

00:03:47.379 --> 00:03:51.849
 really fat actors busy 

00:03:50.260 --> 00:03:53.620
 So in the sense of that they are very much 

00:03:51.849 --> 00:03:55.450
 successful and very well known and very 

00:03:53.620 --> 00:03:56.919
 very good that he goes here too 

00:03:55.450 --> 00:03:57.910
 Definitely not on something here 

00:03:56.919 --> 00:03:58.750
 But unfortunately, it's up to you 

00:03:57.910 --> 00:04:00.459
 voltage arc 

00:03:58.750 --> 00:04:02.650
 because the story is quite 

00:04:00.459 --> 00:04:05.019
 somehow conclusive what it is about 

00:04:02.650 --> 00:04:08.530
 but does it self-assemble with such a thing 

00:04:05.019 --> 00:04:10.060
 pseudo complex narrative strings there 

00:04:08.530 --> 00:04:12.489
 actually could not belong at all 

00:04:10.060 --> 00:04:15.099
 you simply just 90 minutes straight out 

00:04:12.489 --> 00:04:16.810
 because he is taking now too 

00:04:15.099 --> 00:04:19.479
 not as much as you would at all 

00:04:16.810 --> 00:04:21.880
 he knows who are so calm but he 

00:04:19.479 --> 00:04:24.220
 just tried classic 

00:04:21.880 --> 00:04:25.810
 to be two thousand action cinema 

00:04:24.220 --> 00:04:27.910
 the first is in order, there are 

00:04:25.810 --> 00:04:31.389
 a few embarrassing moments and you will 

00:04:27.910 --> 00:04:33.039
 even in the last third not so on 

00:04:31.389 --> 00:04:34.599
 the figures tied up so it's a 

00:04:33.039 --> 00:04:36.460
 little matter so much a piece of the 

00:04:34.599 --> 00:04:37.510
 character stop or piece of the is 

00:04:36.460 --> 00:04:39.070
 I do not care to tell the story 

00:04:37.510 --> 00:04:41.410
 I can always find that more and more 

00:04:39.070 --> 00:04:42.090
 especially if so expedition team stupid if 

00:04:41.410 --> 00:04:43.680
 you 

00:04:42.090 --> 00:04:45.210
 loses characters and it does not matter 

00:04:43.680 --> 00:04:48.510
 that's the case with prometheus 

00:04:45.210 --> 00:04:49.949
 bit of the case overall if you have it 

00:04:48.510 --> 00:04:51.150
 I would have considered seats in the cinema 

00:04:49.949 --> 00:04:53.280
 probably given six if you can 

00:04:51.150 --> 00:04:55.290
 at home watching this movie 

00:04:53.280 --> 00:04:56.850
 and just ran with little expectation 

00:04:55.290 --> 00:04:59.430
 it is definitely a 7 and 

00:04:56.850 --> 00:05:00.780
 couch positive format seven out of ten 

00:04:59.430 --> 00:05:02.580
 There are definitely points for 

00:05:00.780 --> 00:05:05.190
 problems there is super good design q 

00:05:02.580 --> 00:05:06.570
 played so technically sound real to 

00:05:05.190 --> 00:05:07.860
 The good standard script would have you 

00:05:06.570 --> 00:05:09.410
 just a bit can fail 

00:05:07.860 --> 00:05:11.639
 so the story altogether 

00:05:09.410 --> 00:05:13.290
 becomes more exciting and less interchangeable 

00:05:11.639 --> 00:05:15.060
 then know really strong team 

00:05:13.290 --> 00:05:17.100
 so is a good overall 

00:05:15.060 --> 00:05:20.280
 blockbuster perfect for today for the 

00:05:17.100 --> 00:05:23.190
 sunday for you under the last card 

00:05:20.280 --> 00:05:25.200
 classic cherry blossom hanami completely different 

00:05:23.190 --> 00:05:26.580
 genre is there for you down here on the left 

00:05:25.200 --> 00:05:27.810
 and now wants to say but I have 

00:05:26.580 --> 00:05:29.610
 actually like now as a 

00:05:27.810 --> 00:05:31.169
 Do not confuse another movie Michael 

00:05:29.610 --> 00:05:33.030
 anyway baÃŸley like with bradley 

00:05:31.169 --> 00:05:34.979
 cooper then you look but the governing 

00:05:33.030 --> 00:05:36.330
 by emerton sniper at the bottom right 

00:05:34.979 --> 00:05:38.610
 we wish you a nice today 

00:05:36.330 --> 00:05:40.289
