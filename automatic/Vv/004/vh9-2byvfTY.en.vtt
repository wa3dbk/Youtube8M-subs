00:00:00.620 --> 00:00:06.190 

ok<00:00:01.620> when<00:00:01.829> I<00:00:01.860> perform<00:00:02.429> this<00:00:02.959> I<00:00:04.190> kept<00:00:05.190> the

00:00:06.190 --> 00:00:06.200 
ok when I perform this I kept the

00:00:06.200 --> 00:00:11.470 
ok when I perform this I kept the
battery<00:00:07.200> cables<00:00:07.830> connected<00:00:09.139> come<00:00:10.139> over<00:00:10.349> here

00:00:11.470 --> 00:00:11.480 
battery cables connected come over here

00:00:11.480 --> 00:00:17.410 
battery cables connected come over here
and<00:00:12.480> this<00:00:13.380> is<00:00:13.440> for<00:00:13.950> the<00:00:14.630> body<00:00:15.630> control<00:00:16.170> module

00:00:17.410 --> 00:00:17.420 
and this is for the body control module

00:00:17.420 --> 00:00:26.650 
and this is for the body control module
it's<00:00:18.439> on<00:00:19.439> a<00:00:19.670> 2002<00:00:20.670> Monte<00:00:21.270> Carlo<00:00:21.720> SS<00:00:24.050> 3.8<00:00:25.050> liter

00:00:26.650 --> 00:00:26.660 
it's on a 2002 Monte Carlo SS 3.8 liter

00:00:26.660 --> 00:00:33.350 
it's on a 2002 Monte Carlo SS 3.8 liter
v6<00:00:29.869> they're<00:00:30.869> all<00:00:30.960> different<00:00:31.230> I<00:00:31.590> suppose<00:00:32.009> but<00:00:32.790> I

00:00:33.350 --> 00:00:33.360 
v6 they're all different I suppose but I

00:00:33.360 --> 00:00:38.180 
v6 they're all different I suppose but I
already<00:00:34.309> disconnected<00:00:35.309> the<00:00:36.920> connectors<00:00:37.920> and

00:00:38.180 --> 00:00:38.190 
already disconnected the connectors and

00:00:38.190 --> 00:00:41.840 
already disconnected the connectors and
when<00:00:38.850> I<00:00:38.879> did<00:00:39.500> but<00:00:40.500> before<00:00:41.280> that<00:00:41.430> my<00:00:41.610> lights

00:00:41.840 --> 00:00:41.850 
when I did but before that my lights

00:00:41.850 --> 00:00:43.790 
when I did but before that my lights
were<00:00:42.059> flashing<00:00:42.329> or<00:00:43.050> flickering<00:00:43.530> they<00:00:43.739> were

00:00:43.790 --> 00:00:43.800 
were flashing or flickering they were

00:00:43.800 --> 00:00:47.110 
were flashing or flickering they were
flickering<00:00:44.100> so<00:00:45.030> this<00:00:45.930> may<00:00:46.140> be<00:00:46.200> the<00:00:46.620> problem

00:00:47.110 --> 00:00:47.120 
flickering so this may be the problem

00:00:47.120 --> 00:00:52.160 
flickering so this may be the problem
but<00:00:48.120> on<00:00:48.390> this<00:00:49.110> is<00:00:49.289> where<00:00:49.469> it's<00:00:49.590> located<00:00:50.930> so<00:00:51.930> I

00:00:52.160 --> 00:00:52.170 
but on this is where it's located so I

00:00:52.170 --> 00:00:56.689 
but on this is where it's located so I
took<00:00:52.530> all<00:00:52.860> that<00:00:53.039> off<00:00:53.190> for<00:00:53.430> nothing<00:00:53.930> but<00:00:55.699> the

00:00:56.689 --> 00:00:56.699 
took all that off for nothing but the

00:00:56.699 --> 00:01:02.139 
took all that off for nothing but the
panel<00:00:57.180> on<00:00:57.539> the<00:00:58.289> dashboard<00:00:58.890> and
