00:00:58.810 --> 00:00:58.820 
and the original dead space you were

00:00:58.820 --> 00:01:01.030 
and the original dead space you were
able<00:00:58.969> to<00:00:59.180> add<00:00:59.299> nodes<00:00:59.629> to<00:01:00.379> your<00:01:00.500> weapons<00:01:00.829> to

improve<00:01:01.339> them<00:01:01.519> and<00:01:01.549> upgrade<00:01:01.969> them<00:01:02.180> you<00:01:02.750> would

00:01:02.920 --> 00:01:02.930 
improve them and upgrade them you would

00:01:02.930 --> 00:01:05.350 
improve them and upgrade them you would
follow<00:01:03.260> the<00:01:03.500> upgrade<00:01:03.769> trees<00:01:04.009> to<00:01:04.369> make<00:01:04.699> that

00:01:05.350 --> 00:01:05.360 
follow the upgrade trees to make that

00:01:05.360 --> 00:01:08.560 
follow the upgrade trees to make that
say<00:01:05.630> the<00:01:06.289> reload<00:01:06.799> much<00:01:07.250> faster<00:01:07.729> or<00:01:07.909> the<00:01:08.299> gun

00:01:08.560 --> 00:01:08.570 
say the reload much faster or the gun

00:01:08.570 --> 00:01:10.840 
say the reload much faster or the gun
much<00:01:09.080> stronger<00:01:09.380> in<00:01:09.710> Dead<00:01:10.250> Space<00:01:10.280> 2<00:01:10.490> we

00:01:10.840 --> 00:01:10.850 
much stronger in Dead Space 2 we

00:01:10.850 --> 00:01:13.029 
much stronger in Dead Space 2 we
actually<00:01:11.180> even<00:01:11.479> went<00:01:11.720> as<00:01:11.840> far<00:01:11.869> as<00:01:12.140> starting<00:01:12.920> a

00:01:13.029 --> 00:01:13.039 
actually even went as far as starting a

00:01:13.039 --> 00:01:15.130 
actually even went as far as starting a
game<00:01:13.220> with<00:01:13.460> him<00:01:13.509> building<00:01:14.509> his<00:01:14.659> first<00:01:14.690> weapon

00:01:15.130 --> 00:01:15.140 
game with him building his first weapon

00:01:15.140 --> 00:01:17.649 
game with him building his first weapon
out<00:01:15.770> of<00:01:15.950> a<00:01:16.070> flashlight<00:01:16.369> and<00:01:16.759> a<00:01:17.060> surgical<00:01:17.479> tool

00:01:17.649 --> 00:01:17.659 
out of a flashlight and a surgical tool

00:01:17.659 --> 00:01:19.660 
out of a flashlight and a surgical tool
we<00:01:18.319> looked<00:01:18.530> at<00:01:18.619> what<00:01:18.740> we<00:01:18.830> did<00:01:18.979> in<00:01:19.159> Dead<00:01:19.310> Space<00:01:19.340> 1

00:01:19.660 --> 00:01:19.670 
we looked at what we did in Dead Space 1

00:01:19.670 --> 00:01:22.059 
we looked at what we did in Dead Space 1
and<00:01:19.850> 2<00:01:20.000> and<00:01:20.300> the<00:01:21.080> bench<00:01:21.289> is<00:01:21.409> awesome<00:01:21.710> as<00:01:21.830> it<00:01:21.890> was

00:01:22.059 --> 00:01:22.069 
and 2 and the bench is awesome as it was

00:01:22.069 --> 00:01:24.340 
and 2 and the bench is awesome as it was
we<00:01:22.340> found<00:01:22.610> ways<00:01:22.880> to<00:01:22.909> naturally<00:01:23.810> progress<00:01:23.960> to

00:01:24.340 --> 00:01:24.350 
we found ways to naturally progress to

00:01:24.350 --> 00:01:26.320 
we found ways to naturally progress to
this<00:01:24.500> new<00:01:24.860> version<00:01:25.039> in<00:01:25.280> Dead<00:01:25.399> Space<00:01:25.429> 3<00:01:25.610> we've

00:01:26.320 --> 00:01:26.330

00:01:26.330 --> 00:01:27.580 
this new version in Dead Space 3 we've
completely<00:01:26.720> rebuilt<00:01:27.080> the<00:01:27.200> bench<00:01:27.380> from<00:01:27.530> the

00:01:27.580 --> 00:01:27.590 
completely rebuilt the bench from the

00:01:27.590 --> 00:01:29.410 
completely rebuilt the bench from the
ground<00:01:27.800> up<00:01:27.950> not<00:01:28.520> only<00:01:28.729> can<00:01:28.970> you<00:01:29.060> upgrade<00:01:29.240> your

00:01:29.410 --> 00:01:29.420 
ground up not only can you upgrade your

00:01:29.420 --> 00:01:31.149 
ground up not only can you upgrade your
existing<00:01:29.600> weapons<00:01:30.020> you<00:01:30.649> can<00:01:30.770> actually<00:01:31.009> build

00:01:31.149 --> 00:01:31.159 
existing weapons you can actually build

00:01:31.159 --> 00:01:33.910 
existing weapons you can actually build
your<00:01:31.340> weapons<00:01:31.610> from<00:01:31.759> scratch<00:01:32.560> pick<00:01:33.560> a<00:01:33.590> frame

00:01:33.910 --> 00:01:33.920 
your weapons from scratch pick a frame

00:01:33.920 --> 00:01:36.669 
your weapons from scratch pick a frame
say<00:01:34.220> we<00:01:34.340> want<00:01:34.640> the<00:01:34.729> heavy<00:01:34.880> frame<00:01:35.179> and<00:01:35.479> then<00:01:36.409> we

00:01:36.669 --> 00:01:36.679 
say we want the heavy frame and then we

00:01:36.679 --> 00:01:38.950 
say we want the heavy frame and then we
decide<00:01:37.009> when<00:01:37.250> we<00:01:37.369> want<00:01:37.550> as<00:01:37.819> an<00:01:38.000> engine<00:01:38.360> let's

00:01:38.950 --> 00:01:38.960 
decide when we want as an engine let's

00:01:38.960 --> 00:01:40.870 
decide when we want as an engine let's
say<00:01:39.140> we<00:01:39.319> want<00:01:39.560> a<00:01:39.710> Tesla<00:01:40.130> core<00:01:40.310> engine<00:01:40.700> which

00:01:40.870 --> 00:01:40.880 
say we want a Tesla core engine which

00:01:40.880 --> 00:01:42.880 
say we want a Tesla core engine which
creates<00:01:41.240> like<00:01:41.420> electricity<00:01:41.840> that<00:01:42.560> comes<00:01:42.710> out

00:01:42.880 --> 00:01:42.890 
creates like electricity that comes out

00:01:42.890 --> 00:01:45.699 
creates like electricity that comes out
of<00:01:42.920> the<00:01:43.069> gun<00:01:43.250> and<00:01:44.060> we<00:01:44.179> decide<00:01:44.539> that<00:01:44.569> okay<00:01:45.170> so<00:01:45.229> on

00:01:45.699 --> 00:01:45.709 
of the gun and we decide that okay so on

00:01:45.709 --> 00:01:48.100 
of the gun and we decide that okay so on
that<00:01:45.979> gun<00:01:46.280> primary<00:01:47.209> adapter<00:01:47.690> which<00:01:47.840> is<00:01:47.989> the

00:01:48.100 --> 00:01:48.110 
that gun primary adapter which is the

00:01:48.110 --> 00:01:49.749 
that gun primary adapter which is the
tip<00:01:48.319> of<00:01:48.410> the<00:01:48.530> gun<00:01:48.679> we<00:01:48.920> can<00:01:49.069> decide<00:01:49.310> what<00:01:49.550> kind

00:01:49.749 --> 00:01:49.759 
tip of the gun we can decide what kind

00:01:49.759 --> 00:01:53.410 
tip of the gun we can decide what kind
of<00:01:49.879> electricity<00:01:50.330> tip<00:01:51.200> we<00:01:51.440> have<00:01:51.619> or<00:01:51.950> use<00:01:52.420> we've

00:01:53.410 --> 00:01:53.420 
of electricity tip we have or use we've

00:01:53.420 --> 00:01:55.180 
of electricity tip we have or use we've
got<00:01:53.509> all<00:01:53.660> these<00:01:53.810> different<00:01:54.050> ones<00:01:54.379> let's<00:01:54.979> say

00:01:55.180 --> 00:01:55.190 
got all these different ones let's say

00:01:55.190 --> 00:01:59.410 
got all these different ones let's say
we<00:01:55.550> want<00:01:55.759> this<00:01:56.450> one<00:01:56.690> and<00:01:57.020> then<00:01:58.030> for<00:01:59.030> the

00:01:59.410 --> 00:01:59.420 
we want this one and then for the

00:01:59.420 --> 00:02:03.639 
we want this one and then for the
secondary<00:02:00.020> engine<00:02:00.819> we<00:02:01.819> can<00:02:02.000> decide<00:02:02.300> to<00:02:02.649> make

00:02:03.639 --> 00:02:03.649 
secondary engine we can decide to make

00:02:03.649 --> 00:02:08.630 
secondary engine we can decide to make
the<00:02:03.800> bottom<00:02:04.160> one<00:02:04.369> say<00:02:05.530> make<00:02:06.530> fire<00:02:06.830> how's<00:02:07.129> that

00:02:08.630 --> 00:02:08.640 
the bottom one say make fire how's that

00:02:08.640 --> 00:02:11.420 
the bottom one say make fire how's that
there<00:02:09.539> you<00:02:09.630> go<00:02:09.750> I<00:02:09.990> like<00:02:10.530> that<00:02:10.649> gun<00:02:10.890> let's<00:02:11.190> build
