00:00:44.970 --> 00:00:44.980 
basically you turn this a eighth of a

00:00:44.980 --> 00:00:48.300 
basically you turn this a eighth of a
turn<00:00:45.220> to<00:00:46.120> let<00:00:46.300> it<00:00:46.330> brew<00:00:46.570> through<00:00:46.840> a<00:00:46.900> drip<00:00:47.310> it'll

00:00:48.300 --> 00:00:48.310

00:00:48.310 --> 00:00:50.180 
turn to let it brew through a drip it'll
take<00:00:48.490> a<00:00:48.520> while<00:00:48.730> but<00:00:49.120> that's<00:00:49.300> okay

00:01:22.870 --> 00:01:31.690 
just put the filter packs in there if
you<00:01:22.960> wanted<00:01:23.229> but<00:01:23.410> I<00:01:23.680> guess<00:01:24.369> I'm<00:01:24.520> not<00:01:24.670> gonna

00:01:31.690 --> 00:01:31.700 

00:01:31.700 --> 00:01:34.730 

so<00:01:32.700> let<00:01:33.690> me<00:01:33.720> go<00:01:33.900> ahead<00:01:33.990> and<00:01:34.110> pour<00:01:34.380> in<00:01:34.470> my<00:01:34.560> hot

00:01:34.730 --> 00:01:34.740

so let me go ahead and pour in my hot
water<00:01:34.890> so<00:01:35.760> hot<00:01:35.970> and<00:01:36.800> try<00:01:37.800> not<00:01:37.920> to<00:01:37.980> spill<00:01:38.160> too

00:01:38.510 --> 00:01:38.520 
water so hot and try not to spill too

00:01:38.520 --> 00:01:50.740 
water so hot and try not to spill too
much<00:01:38.700> of<00:01:38.880> it<00:01:39.030> but<00:01:39.210> I<00:01:39.240> probably<00:01:39.600> will

00:01:50.740 --> 00:01:50.750 

00:01:50.750 --> 00:01:53.500 

try<00:01:51.230> to<00:01:51.290> go<00:01:51.500> coffee<00:01:51.890> in<00:01:52.160> there<00:01:52.310> nice<00:01:53.030> wait<00:01:53.390> on

00:01:53.500 --> 00:01:53.510 
try to go coffee in there nice wait on

00:01:53.510 --> 00:02:03.220 
try to go coffee in there nice wait on
that<00:01:53.540> I<00:02:01.180> may<00:02:02.180> have<00:02:02.270> to<00:02:02.390> port<00:02:02.720> through<00:02:02.990> twice

00:02:03.220 --> 00:02:03.230 
that I may have to port through twice

00:02:03.230 --> 00:02:06.870 
that I may have to port through twice
depending<00:02:03.590> on<00:02:04.130> how<00:02:04.760> the<00:02:04.820> coffee<00:02:05.060> comes<00:02:05.360> out

00:02:06.870 --> 00:02:06.880 
depending on how the coffee comes out

00:02:06.880 --> 00:02:09.430 
depending on how the coffee comes out
yeah<00:02:07.880> it's<00:02:08.060> kind<00:02:08.270> a<00:02:08.300> little<00:02:08.510> weak<00:02:08.660> so<00:02:09.080> lot

00:02:09.430 --> 00:02:09.440 
yeah it's kind a little weak so lot

00:02:09.440 --> 00:02:14.350 
yeah it's kind a little weak so lot
supports<00:02:09.830> or<00:02:09.950> twice<00:02:11.530> that's<00:02:12.530> okay<00:02:12.830> though<00:02:13.360> we

00:02:14.350 --> 00:02:14.360 
supports or twice that's okay though we

00:02:14.360 --> 00:02:24.880 
supports or twice that's okay though we
could<00:02:14.510> do<00:02:14.630> that

00:02:24.880 --> 00:02:24.890 

00:02:24.890 --> 00:02:33.369 

get<00:02:25.890> out<00:02:26.580> of<00:02:26.610> there

00:02:33.369 --> 00:02:33.379 

00:02:33.379 --> 00:02:47.270 

till<00:02:34.379> I<00:02:34.409> came<00:02:34.620> a<00:02:34.769> little<00:02:35.010> weak

00:02:47.270 --> 00:02:47.280 

00:02:47.280 --> 00:02:51.890 

good<00:02:48.480> you<00:02:49.480> almost<00:02:49.840> fall<00:02:50.049> over<00:02:50.109> the<00:02:50.319> top<00:02:50.499> filter

00:02:51.890 --> 00:02:51.900 
good you almost fall over the top filter

00:02:51.900 --> 00:03:08.869 
good you almost fall over the top filter
and<00:02:52.900> I<00:02:53.139> didn't<00:02:53.409> open<00:02:53.469> the<00:02:53.650> bottom<00:02:53.920> up

00:03:08.869 --> 00:03:08.879 

00:03:08.879 --> 00:03:11.339 

and<00:03:09.879> maybe<00:03:10.150> we<00:03:10.269> do<00:03:10.420> it<00:03:10.450> a<00:03:10.569> third<00:03:10.720> time<00:03:10.750> I<00:03:11.170> don't

00:03:11.339 --> 00:03:11.349 
and maybe we do it a third time I don't

00:03:11.349 --> 00:03:25.370 
and maybe we do it a third time I don't
know

00:03:25.370 --> 00:03:25.380 

00:03:25.380 --> 00:03:29.490 

so<00:03:26.380> you<00:03:26.470> just<00:03:26.650> trickled<00:03:27.130> out<00:03:28.200> you<00:03:29.200> can<00:03:29.380> slow

00:03:29.490 --> 00:03:29.500 
so you just trickled out you can slow

00:03:29.500 --> 00:03:31.350 
so you just trickled out you can slow
that<00:03:29.680> down<00:03:29.890> from<00:03:30.160> stronger<00:03:30.490> brew<00:03:30.730> I<00:03:30.760> just<00:03:31.060> do

00:03:31.350 --> 00:03:31.360 
that down from stronger brew I just do

00:03:31.360 --> 00:03:36.870 
that down from stronger brew I just do
it<00:03:31.450> twice<00:03:31.690> to<00:03:31.930> make<00:03:31.960> life<00:03:32.320> easier<00:03:35.640> in<00:03:36.640> fact

00:03:36.870 --> 00:03:36.880 
it twice to make life easier in fact

00:03:36.880 --> 00:03:42.330 
it twice to make life easier in fact
