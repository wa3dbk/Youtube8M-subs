freestyler here I trained distance

00:00:19.680 --> 00:00:22.490 
freestyler here I trained distance
freestyle<00:00:20.270> but<00:00:21.270> I<00:00:21.360> do<00:00:21.420> swim<00:00:21.870> every<00:00:22.230> once<00:00:22.380> a

00:00:22.490 --> 00:00:22.500 
freestyle but I do swim every once a

00:00:22.500 --> 00:00:25.400 
freestyle but I do swim every once a
while<00:00:22.530> I<00:00:22.650> am<00:00:23.220> definitely<00:00:23.550> say<00:00:23.940> had<00:00:24.870> a<00:00:24.900> harder

00:00:25.400 --> 00:00:25.410 
while I am definitely say had a harder

00:00:25.410 --> 00:00:27.920 
while I am definitely say had a harder
challenge<00:00:25.830> growing<00:00:26.460> up<00:00:26.570> developing<00:00:27.570> or

00:00:27.920 --> 00:00:27.930 
challenge growing up developing or

00:00:27.930 --> 00:00:29.210 
challenge growing up developing or
trying<00:00:28.260> to<00:00:28.350> learn<00:00:28.500> how<00:00:28.770> to<00:00:28.830> swim<00:00:29.010> the

00:00:29.210 --> 00:00:29.220 
trying to learn how to swim the

00:00:29.220 --> 00:00:31.460 
trying to learn how to swim the
Freestyle<00:00:29.640> stroke<00:00:29.810> I'm<00:00:30.810> probably<00:00:31.290> more

00:00:31.460 --> 00:00:31.470 
Freestyle stroke I'm probably more

00:00:31.470 --> 00:00:32.749 
Freestyle stroke I'm probably more
dominant<00:00:31.920> on<00:00:32.040> my<00:00:32.129> right<00:00:32.309> arm<00:00:32.520> and<00:00:32.610> ice<00:00:32.730> from

00:00:32.749 --> 00:00:32.759 
dominant on my right arm and ice from

00:00:32.759 --> 00:00:35.060 
dominant on my right arm and ice from
the<00:00:32.940> Freestyle<00:00:33.420> so<00:00:34.020> I'm<00:00:34.110> able<00:00:34.230> to<00:00:34.470> rotate<00:00:34.620> way

00:00:35.060 --> 00:00:35.070 
the Freestyle so I'm able to rotate way

00:00:35.070 --> 00:00:37.130 
the Freestyle so I'm able to rotate way
more<00:00:35.310> on<00:00:35.400> my<00:00:35.490> right<00:00:35.670> side<00:00:35.750> than<00:00:36.750> my<00:00:36.810> left

00:00:37.130 --> 00:00:37.140 
more on my right side than my left

00:00:37.140 --> 00:00:38.660 
more on my right side than my left
because<00:00:37.440> when<00:00:37.710> i<00:00:37.740> go<00:00:37.890> to<00:00:37.920> rotate<00:00:38.250> to<00:00:38.340> my<00:00:38.460> left

00:00:38.660 --> 00:00:38.670 
because when i go to rotate to my left

00:00:38.670 --> 00:00:41.300 
because when i go to rotate to my left
I'd<00:00:38.970> become<00:00:39.300> off<00:00:39.510> balanced<00:00:40.170> it's<00:00:40.770> mostly<00:00:41.130> the

00:00:41.300 --> 00:00:41.310 
I'd become off balanced it's mostly the

00:00:41.310 --> 00:00:44.000 
I'd become off balanced it's mostly the
balance<00:00:41.670> and<00:00:41.910> we<00:00:42.900> really<00:00:43.230> had<00:00:43.410> to<00:00:43.440> deal<00:00:43.800> with<00:00:43.829> a

00:00:44.000 --> 00:00:44.010 
balance and we really had to deal with a

00:00:44.010 --> 00:00:45.319 
balance and we really had to deal with a
lot<00:00:44.100> of<00:00:44.340> that<00:00:44.579> at<00:00:44.610> the<00:00:44.790> beginning<00:00:44.910> of<00:00:45.180> his

00:00:45.319 --> 00:00:45.329 
lot of that at the beginning of his

00:00:45.329 --> 00:00:47.060 
lot of that at the beginning of his
freshman<00:00:45.750> year<00:00:45.780> and<00:00:46.020> he<00:00:46.320> doesn't<00:00:46.890> have<00:00:47.040> the

00:00:47.060 --> 00:00:47.070 
freshman year and he doesn't have the

00:00:47.070 --> 00:00:48.710 
freshman year and he doesn't have the
one<00:00:47.370> kick<00:00:47.700> that<00:00:47.970> doesn't<00:00:48.239> have<00:00:48.329> the<00:00:48.420> one<00:00:48.570> like

00:00:48.710 --> 00:00:48.720 
one kick that doesn't have the one like

00:00:48.720 --> 00:00:50.000 
one kick that doesn't have the one like
so<00:00:48.870> he<00:00:49.020> has<00:00:49.140> to<00:00:49.260> really<00:00:49.410> work<00:00:49.620> on<00:00:49.739> stabilizing

00:00:50.000 --> 00:00:50.010 
so he has to really work on stabilizing

00:00:50.010 --> 00:00:52.010 
so he has to really work on stabilizing
with<00:00:50.790> this<00:00:50.940> course<00:00:51.210> we<00:00:51.390> had<00:00:51.510> to<00:00:51.540> get<00:00:51.720> him<00:00:51.870> to<00:00:51.930> be

00:00:52.010 --> 00:00:52.020 
with this course we had to get him to be

00:00:52.020 --> 00:00:53.930 
with this course we had to get him to be
a<00:00:52.050> little<00:00:52.230> more<00:00:52.320> tight<00:00:52.770> with<00:00:52.980> his<00:00:53.100> core<00:00:53.460> I<00:00:53.700> mean

00:00:53.930 --> 00:00:53.940 
a little more tight with his core I mean

00:00:53.940 --> 00:00:55.130 
a little more tight with his core I mean
I<00:00:54.030> always<00:00:54.300> should<00:00:54.570> I<00:00:54.720> should<00:00:54.930> have<00:00:55.020> always

00:00:55.130 --> 00:00:55.140 
I always should I should have always

00:00:55.140 --> 00:00:56.930 
I always should I should have always
done<00:00:55.380> you<00:00:55.620> no<00:00:55.710> more<00:00:55.920> core<00:00:56.160> strength<00:00:56.460> but<00:00:56.610> first

00:00:56.930 --> 00:00:56.940 
done you no more core strength but first

00:00:56.940 --> 00:00:58.100 
done you no more core strength but first
there's<00:00:57.120> more<00:00:57.270> developing<00:00:57.660> learning<00:00:57.840> how<00:00:58.050> to

00:00:58.100 --> 00:00:58.110 
there's more developing learning how to

00:00:58.110 --> 00:00:59.720 
there's more developing learning how to
swear<00:00:58.440> I<00:00:58.560> say<00:00:58.710> most<00:00:58.980> of<00:00:59.070> the<00:00:59.160> core<00:00:59.340> shake<00:00:59.520> now

00:00:59.720 --> 00:00:59.730 
swear I say most of the core shake now

00:00:59.730 --> 00:01:01.700 
swear I say most of the core shake now
doesn't<00:01:00.300> come<00:01:00.510> out<00:01:00.750> of<00:01:01.020> the<00:01:01.079> pool<00:01:01.230> come<00:01:01.440> still

00:01:01.700 --> 00:01:01.710 
doesn't come out of the pool come still

00:01:01.710 --> 00:01:03.260 
doesn't come out of the pool come still
within<00:01:01.860> the<00:01:02.010> pool<00:01:02.280> I<00:01:02.489> was<00:01:02.820> something<00:01:03.030> I<00:01:03.120> need

00:01:03.260 --> 00:01:03.270 
within the pool I was something I need

00:01:03.270 --> 00:01:04.700 
within the pool I was something I need
to<00:01:03.300> consciously<00:01:03.570> be<00:01:03.809> thinking<00:01:04.079> about<00:01:04.170> it<00:01:04.379> what

00:01:04.700 --> 00:01:04.710 
to consciously be thinking about it what

00:01:04.710 --> 00:01:06.230 
to consciously be thinking about it what
makes<00:01:04.890> us<00:01:05.040> somewhere<00:01:05.249> fast<00:01:05.460> is<00:01:05.700> not<00:01:05.819> how<00:01:05.969> good

00:01:06.230 --> 00:01:06.240 
makes us somewhere fast is not how good

00:01:06.240 --> 00:01:09.440 
makes us somewhere fast is not how good
he<00:01:06.420> is<00:01:06.450> it's<00:01:07.399> that<00:01:08.399> he's<00:01:08.490> always<00:01:08.700> thinking<00:01:09.030> I

00:01:09.440 --> 00:01:09.450 
he is it's that he's always thinking I

00:01:09.450 --> 00:01:10.879 
he is it's that he's always thinking I
think<00:01:09.899> that's<00:01:10.020> what<00:01:10.139> pulls<00:01:10.350> me<00:01:10.469> away<00:01:10.560> from<00:01:10.829> a

00:01:10.879 --> 00:01:10.889 
think that's what pulls me away from a

00:01:10.889 --> 00:01:12.260 
think that's what pulls me away from a
lot<00:01:11.039> of<00:01:11.100> the<00:01:11.159> other<00:01:11.280> swimmers<00:01:11.520> I'm<00:01:12.060> always

00:01:12.260 --> 00:01:12.270 
lot of the other swimmers I'm always

00:01:12.270 --> 00:01:13.910 
lot of the other swimmers I'm always
thinking<00:01:12.539> why<00:01:12.810> I'm<00:01:12.899> sorry<00:01:13.109> then<00:01:13.649> the<00:01:13.770> other

00:01:13.910 --> 00:01:13.920 
thinking why I'm sorry then the other

00:01:13.920 --> 00:01:16.129 
thinking why I'm sorry then the other
problem<00:01:14.310> is<00:01:14.399> being<00:01:14.639> short<00:01:14.909> course<00:01:15.119> yards<00:01:15.539> he's

00:01:16.129 --> 00:01:16.139 
problem is being short course yards he's

00:01:16.139 --> 00:01:17.929 
problem is being short course yards he's
got<00:01:16.319> to<00:01:16.350> come<00:01:16.530> off<00:01:16.590> with<00:01:17.280> one<00:01:17.520> leg<00:01:17.700> where

00:01:17.929 --> 00:01:17.939 
got to come off with one leg where

00:01:17.939 --> 00:01:19.160 
got to come off with one leg where
everybody<00:01:18.240> else<00:01:18.299> is<00:01:18.539> coming<00:01:18.780> off<00:01:18.869> with<00:01:19.020> two

00:01:19.160 --> 00:01:19.170 
everybody else is coming off with two

00:01:19.170 --> 00:01:21.469 
everybody else is coming off with two
legs<00:01:19.380> so<00:01:19.649> the<00:01:20.069> problem<00:01:20.369> is<00:01:20.670> then<00:01:20.969> the<00:01:21.209> end<00:01:21.359> of

00:01:21.469 --> 00:01:21.479 
legs so the problem is then the end of

00:01:21.479 --> 00:01:23.660 
legs so the problem is then the end of
races<00:01:21.869> he's<00:01:22.079> he's<00:01:22.799> struggling<00:01:23.310> to<00:01:23.340> try<00:01:23.579> to

00:01:23.660 --> 00:01:23.670 
races he's he's struggling to try to

00:01:23.670 --> 00:01:25.039 
races he's he's struggling to try to
keep<00:01:23.850> up<00:01:24.030> with<00:01:24.090> them<00:01:24.359> when<00:01:24.569> they're<00:01:24.719> able<00:01:24.869> to

00:01:25.039 --> 00:01:25.049 
keep up with them when they're able to

00:01:25.049 --> 00:01:27.199 
keep up with them when they're able to
bring<00:01:25.229> in<00:01:25.380> their<00:01:25.499> legs<00:01:25.679> and<00:01:25.859> he's<00:01:26.039> not<00:01:26.249> going

00:01:27.199 --> 00:01:27.209 
bring in their legs and he's not going

00:01:27.209 --> 00:01:30.109 
bring in their legs and he's not going
into<00:01:27.450> the<00:01:27.630> turn<00:01:28.549> acceleration<00:01:29.549> definitely

00:01:30.109 --> 00:01:30.119 
into the turn acceleration definitely

00:01:30.119 --> 00:01:31.459 
into the turn acceleration definitely
most<00:01:30.270> important<00:01:30.630> things<00:01:30.779> especially<00:01:30.929> for<00:01:31.319> me

00:01:31.459 --> 00:01:31.469 
most important things especially for me

00:01:31.469 --> 00:01:33.080 
most important things especially for me
is<00:01:31.709> for<00:01:32.009> me<00:01:32.100> to<00:01:32.219> get<00:01:32.310> off<00:01:32.429> the<00:01:32.579> wall<00:01:32.700> with<00:01:32.909> other

00:01:33.080 --> 00:01:33.090 
is for me to get off the wall with other

00:01:33.090 --> 00:01:34.699 
is for me to get off the wall with other
swimmers<00:01:33.329> with<00:01:33.539> two<00:01:33.659> legs<00:01:33.840> I<00:01:34.109> need<00:01:34.499> to<00:01:34.590> be

00:01:34.699 --> 00:01:34.709 
swimmers with two legs I need to be

00:01:34.709 --> 00:01:36.109

wall<00:01:38.149> he<00:01:39.149> doesn't<00:01:39.450> have<00:01:39.509> as<00:01:39.659> much<00:01:39.810> power<00:01:39.869> we

00:01:40.219 --> 00:01:40.229 
wall he doesn't have as much power we

00:01:40.229 --> 00:01:42.559 
wall he doesn't have as much power we
did<00:01:40.649> work<00:01:40.889> on<00:01:41.100> him<00:01:41.399> coming<00:01:41.759> over<00:01:41.909> the<00:01:41.999> top<00:01:42.029> more

00:01:42.559 --> 00:01:42.569 
did work on him coming over the top more

00:01:42.569 --> 00:01:44.629 
did work on him coming over the top more
on<00:01:42.779> his<00:01:43.170> turns<00:01:43.469> rather<00:01:43.859> than<00:01:44.099> coming<00:01:44.340> to<00:01:44.520> the

00:01:44.629 --> 00:01:44.639 
on his turns rather than coming to the

00:01:44.639 --> 00:01:47.359 
on his turns rather than coming to the
side<00:01:44.909> which<00:01:45.539> a<00:01:45.659> lot<00:01:45.840> of<00:01:45.869> swimmers<00:01:46.200> will<00:01:46.529> do<00:01:46.770> but

side which a lot of swimmers will do but

00:01:47.369 --> 00:01:48.949

00:01:48.949 --> 00:01:48.959 
he needs to come over the top more so

00:01:48.959 --> 00:01:50.660 
he needs to come over the top more so
that<00:01:48.990> he's<00:01:49.200> got<00:01:49.409> that<00:01:49.590> one<00:01:49.649> leg<00:01:50.189> that<00:01:50.369> he<00:01:50.459> has

00:01:54.379 --> 00:01:54.389 
pushes off the wall so he's coming

00:01:54.389 --> 00:01:55.969 
pushes off the wall so he's coming
straight<00:01:54.420> off<00:01:54.719> the<00:01:54.779> wall<00:01:55.049> the<00:01:55.200> woods<00:01:55.349> with<00:01:55.799> as
