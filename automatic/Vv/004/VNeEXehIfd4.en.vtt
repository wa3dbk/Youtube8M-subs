00:00:03.270 --> 00:00:06.270
 they no longer do anything to look for a solution 

00:00:09.199 --> 00:00:10.649
 jazz all right 

00:00:10.649 --> 00:00:13.649
 street theater 

00:00:15.529 --> 00:00:17.409
 we talk further 

00:00:17.409 --> 00:00:19.650
 but that is by no means certain 

00:00:19.650 --> 00:00:23.460
 she extinguished it is known that bon is coming 

00:00:23.460 --> 00:00:26.810
 hence the question of whether the suitcase with 22 percent 

00:00:26.810 --> 00:00:29.810
 the area it turns into axes 7 

00:00:32.810 --> 00:00:33.960
 79 

00:00:33.960 --> 00:00:38.330
 I am coming today today Saturday at the start everything starts alone 

00:00:38.330 --> 00:00:39.110
 if it's about 

00:00:39.110 --> 00:00:41.760
 conflict with his crew and singer 

00:00:41.760 --> 00:00:45.140
 propose excellent punishment tests 

00:00:45.140 --> 00:00:47.290
 even more important 

00:00:47.290 --> 00:00:48.170
 then 

00:00:48.170 --> 00:00:50.950
 another child is coming 

00:00:50.950 --> 00:00:53.590
 that make 

00:00:53.590 --> 00:00:54.790
 when swift 

00:00:54.790 --> 00:00:59.110
 wondering if we might be on a new creation again, I was completely happy 

00:00:59.110 --> 00:01:01.090
 with my achievement 

00:01:01.090 --> 00:01:02.839
 so the typing is not 

00:01:02.839 --> 00:01:05.390
 so yes I am not talking about Jan vanseveren 

00:01:05.390 --> 00:01:08.370
 He wanted to know that they remain on trial rules for the time being 

00:01:08.370 --> 00:01:09.400
 to read 

00:01:09.400 --> 00:01:12.810
 the 28 year old jesse 

00:01:12.810 --> 00:01:14.390
 the good we see 

00:01:14.390 --> 00:01:15.680
 just wait and see 

00:01:15.680 --> 00:01:18.680
 what I myself told them further 

00:01:23.490 --> 00:01:26.630
 most sellers start the development of the region 

00:01:28.340 --> 00:01:31.340
 that's why it's not finished yet 

00:01:34.290 --> 00:01:39.250
 the argument of the home as you do with it a bit relaxed and that 

00:01:39.250 --> 00:01:42.250
 increased 

00:01:46.610 --> 00:01:50.080
 because was not too sick and nothing less than not prepared 

00:01:50.640 --> 00:01:53.650
 police received this sad extra attention 

00:01:53.650 --> 00:01:56.650
 they have to fight with a bicycle 

00:02:03.070 --> 00:02:04.330
 said 

00:02:04.330 --> 00:02:05.810
 three house 

00:02:05.810 --> 00:02:08.769
 it's only a shame if you do 

00:02:08.769 --> 00:02:11.399
 who want to invest 

00:02:11.399 --> 00:02:14.399
 well and what exactly is that 

00:02:14.949 --> 00:02:17.009
 claiming that can't make it 

00:02:17.009 --> 00:02:18.849
 and yes 

00:02:18.849 --> 00:02:19.889
 there I am 

00:02:19.889 --> 00:02:22.620
 if you are such things as something like that 

00:02:22.620 --> 00:02:24.549
 to see the exhibition 

00:02:24.549 --> 00:02:26.069
 the entire match 

00:02:26.069 --> 00:02:28.739
 list dedecker 

00:02:28.739 --> 00:02:30.509
 if you see so min 

00:02:30.509 --> 00:02:33.669
 much more to be trusted 

00:02:33.669 --> 00:02:37.219
 and then now the fourth underrated all went wrong is perhaps it 

00:02:37.219 --> 00:02:38.549
 most important thing 

00:02:38.549 --> 00:02:40.629
 for me the recovery 

00:02:40.629 --> 00:02:43.859
 just like at the end of the first word 

00:02:43.859 --> 00:02:45.470
 I'll take them to a good cause 

00:02:45.470 --> 00:02:47.300
 this is not an extra training on Sunday 

00:02:47.300 --> 00:02:50.349
 both sitting and being so smoothly, however, do not 

00:02:50.859 --> 00:02:55.149
 although she is duke jan sixteen times your stake here is still unknown 3 

00:02:55.149 --> 00:02:58.149
 three people only employ the than music style 

00:02:59.539 --> 00:03:02.539
 do not 

00:03:06.049 --> 00:03:09.049
 what they are going to say is their own social purpose 

00:03:09.049 --> 00:03:12.009
 the party says to let xu know anp it is still 

00:03:12.009 --> 00:03:13.879
 two seconds 

00:03:13.879 --> 00:03:18.549
 this season when our cows go the 100 meters and with success I have always been 

00:03:18.549 --> 00:03:19.779
 a list 

00:03:19.779 --> 00:03:23.599
 our but your day a bit in a nice way in the sunshine bit 

00:03:23.599 --> 00:03:25.379
 shine board 

00:03:25.379 --> 00:03:26.809
 I have a storm 

00:03:26.809 --> 00:03:29.809
 ask them important ajax 

00:03:33.199 --> 00:03:34.699
 best cooks all 

00:03:34.699 --> 00:03:36.329
 slightly more betting on 

00:03:36.329 --> 00:03:37.509
 I will be 

00:03:37.509 --> 00:03:42.439
 easy year comes all but hopefully if that pass his city bam 

00:03:42.439 --> 00:03:45.439
 we rate the points as an example 

00:03:47.069 --> 00:03:49.819
 we have the unions way 

00:03:49.819 --> 00:03:50.599
