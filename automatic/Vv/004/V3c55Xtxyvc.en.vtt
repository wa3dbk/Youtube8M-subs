 good I've ever heard 

00:02:55.730 --> 00:03:02.090
 located in england it seems to me one 

00:02:58.580 --> 00:03:04.400
 almost artisan life is a company 

00:03:02.090 --> 00:03:07.820
 craft that produces this liquid 

00:03:04.400 --> 00:03:11.800
 it is not easy to find but when it is 

00:03:07.820 --> 00:03:16.180
 they find you slam is a boys thing 

00:03:11.800 --> 00:03:16.180
 indeed it is one thing 

00:03:20.650 --> 00:03:27.000
 that is, you have no ideas if you never have it 

00:03:23.890 --> 00:03:29.980
 heard you have no idea what it is 

00:03:27.000 --> 00:03:32.860
 you really feel the English cream yes 

00:03:29.980 --> 00:03:40.379
 feels the cream is a show yes 

00:03:32.860 --> 00:03:44.790
 they even hear the eggs I am 

00:03:40.379 --> 00:03:49.930
 developing at this point with the tic ice 

00:03:44.790 --> 00:04:04.000
 a zenith atomizer dripping scheme 

00:03:49.930 --> 00:04:06.670
 dual core is goodness is goodness there 

00:04:04.000 --> 00:04:12.030
 I say more if you like liquids 

00:04:06.670 --> 00:04:15.400
 creamy desserts that taste like sweet 

00:04:12.030 --> 00:04:17.889
 more than wrong to say if you like them 

00:04:15.400 --> 00:04:22.320
 sweet liquids because there is sweet dessert 

00:04:17.889 --> 00:04:29.229
 this tastes like sweet vanilla custard 

00:04:22.320 --> 00:04:33.940
 so it's exactly the taste of dessert 

00:04:29.229 --> 00:04:37.000
 English you can't escape this is the taste 

00:04:33.940 --> 00:04:42.820
 also to smell so you also see the 

00:04:37.000 --> 00:04:47.949
 color is quite similar to that of the 

00:04:42.820 --> 00:04:55.300
 of vanilla castel and of course knows 

00:04:47.949 --> 00:04:58.360
 even a little vanilla here is something 

00:04:55.300 --> 00:05:02.699
 what I would like to say is that nothing advises 

00:04:58.360 --> 00:05:06.340
 to keep the liquid in the refrigerator or 

00:05:02.699 --> 00:05:09.060
 even in the freezer for that 

00:05:06.340 --> 00:05:09.060
 preserves better 

00:05:09.639 --> 00:05:21.310
