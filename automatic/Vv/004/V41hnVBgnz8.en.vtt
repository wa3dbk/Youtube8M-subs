it's like I was mentioning is something

00:01:10.290 --> 00:01:11.330 
it's like I was mentioning is something
that<00:01:10.350> I've<00:01:10.439> been<00:01:10.470> compiling<00:01:10.829> over<00:01:11.040> time<00:01:11.189> ever

00:01:11.330 --> 00:01:11.340 
that I've been compiling over time ever

00:01:11.340 --> 00:01:13.190 
that I've been compiling over time ever
since<00:01:11.490> college<00:01:12.149> so<00:01:12.390> if<00:01:12.720> you<00:01:12.810> were<00:01:12.899> to<00:01:12.960> account

00:01:13.190 --> 00:01:13.200 
since college so if you were to account

00:01:13.200 --> 00:01:15.830 
since college so if you were to account
it<00:01:13.320> back<00:01:13.829> then<00:01:14.070> it<00:01:14.310> would<00:01:14.430> be<00:01:14.520> about<00:01:14.790> like<00:01:15.119> like

00:01:15.830 --> 00:01:15.840 
it back then it would be about like like

00:01:15.840 --> 00:01:18.770 
it back then it would be about like like
nine<00:01:16.110> years<00:01:16.140> but<00:01:16.979> if<00:01:17.100> you<00:01:17.220> were<00:01:17.280> to<00:01:17.340> count<00:01:17.780> the

00:01:18.770 --> 00:01:18.780 
nine years but if you were to count the

00:01:18.780 --> 00:01:20.270 
nine years but if you were to count the
actual<00:01:19.079> official<00:01:19.409> development<00:01:19.740> when<00:01:20.040> we<00:01:20.159> got

00:01:20.270 --> 00:01:20.280 
actual official development when we got

00:01:20.280 --> 00:01:23.060 
actual official development when we got
picked<00:01:20.520> up<00:01:20.640> by<00:01:20.780> research<00:01:21.780> and<00:01:22.049> published<00:01:23.040> by

00:01:48.529 --> 00:01:48.539 
gist of it it's basically like

00:01:48.539 --> 00:01:50.359 
gist of it it's basically like
influenced<00:01:49.530> by<00:01:49.619> the<00:01:49.680> vs.<00:01:50.130> series

00:01:50.359 --> 00:01:50.369 
influenced by the vs. series

00:01:50.369 --> 00:01:52.429 
influenced by the vs. series
particularly<00:01:50.670> marvel<00:01:51.090> vs<00:01:51.299> capcom<00:01:51.329> 2<00:01:51.840> but<00:01:52.289> like

00:01:52.429 --> 00:01:52.439 
particularly marvel vs capcom 2 but like

00:01:52.439 --> 00:01:53.929 
particularly marvel vs capcom 2 but like
you<00:01:52.469> know<00:01:52.649> modified<00:01:53.310> anyways<00:01:53.579> that<00:01:53.759> Mike<00:01:53.909> that

00:01:53.929 --> 00:01:53.939 
you know modified anyways that Mike that

00:01:53.939 --> 00:01:55.999 
you know modified anyways that Mike that
would<00:01:54.270> make<00:01:54.990> the<00:01:55.109> game<00:01:55.259> better<00:01:55.289> for<00:01:55.680> example

00:01:55.999 --> 00:01:56.009 
would make the game better for example

00:01:56.009 --> 00:01:57.920 
would make the game better for example
it<00:01:56.219> can<00:01:56.340> detect<00:01:56.520> infinity<00:01:57.060> and<00:01:57.210> you<00:01:57.329> can<00:01:57.479> break

00:01:57.920 --> 00:01:57.930 
it can detect infinity and you can break

00:01:57.930 --> 00:01:59.539 
it can detect infinity and you can break
out<00:01:58.079> of<00:01:58.109> infinite<00:01:58.799> from<00:01:58.920> the<00:01:58.979> game<00:01:59.130> detects<00:01:59.429> it

00:01:59.539 --> 00:01:59.549 
out of infinite from the game detects it

00:01:59.549 --> 00:02:01.639 
out of infinite from the game detects it
you<00:02:00.329> can<00:02:00.450> also<00:02:00.570> have<00:02:00.750> custom<00:02:01.079> assists<00:02:01.500> which
