00:00:05.150 --> 00:00:13.620
 we will present here a model with a 

00:00:08.750 --> 00:00:15.630
 model in the west is with nine modules 

00:00:13.620 --> 00:00:19.080
 we are developing here by testing 

00:00:15.630 --> 00:00:22.320
 also to see to what extent these 

00:00:19.080 --> 00:00:25.439
 bees will produce here from here we 

00:00:22.320 --> 00:00:36.000
 Let's put the middle in the middle and not half the 

00:00:25.439 --> 00:00:40.070
 Lake bowl with us kittens to see 

00:00:36.000 --> 00:00:44.129
 how they will react here in this 

00:00:40.070 --> 00:00:59.190
 cache with furniture in nine modules 9 

00:00:44.129 --> 00:01:02.340
 Closed compartment is a small box. 

00:00:59.190 --> 00:01:06.210
 which has to be used wherever 

00:01:02.340 --> 00:01:09.119
 out is abundant, not because 

00:01:06.210 --> 00:01:11.220
 good to put and where it has no food 

00:01:09.119 --> 00:01:14.460
 of the bees that will take forever to 

00:01:11.220 --> 00:01:18.180
 stuff is there horizontal model that 

00:01:14.460 --> 00:01:20.630
 here is another model also with six 

00:01:18.180 --> 00:01:20.630
 modules 

00:01:25.200 --> 00:01:36.450
 the vitinho yoga and internal measures 

00:01:32.520 --> 00:01:40.590
 always the same between the preserves if the 

00:01:36.450 --> 00:01:45.740
 internal measures of these boxes to 

00:01:40.590 --> 00:01:49.439
 you can use in any halls 

00:01:45.740 --> 00:01:52.819
 these internal measures we will do there 

00:01:49.439 --> 00:01:55.319
 confusion is making your mother easy 

00:01:52.819 --> 00:02:05.700
 it will not work that she's going 

00:01:55.319 --> 00:02:07.590
 stamping dies say this one with 

00:02:05.700 --> 00:02:11.090
 Seven 

00:02:07.590 --> 00:02:18.300
 the last module your position in football 

00:02:11.090 --> 00:02:25.860
 all on the blue bus theme all eyes and 

00:02:18.300 --> 00:02:28.379
 18 of the same theme the black that is used in the 

00:02:25.860 --> 00:02:31.349
 I mean, I do not have any anymore. 

00:02:28.379 --> 00:02:40.730
 in that church putting but you already 

00:02:31.349 --> 00:02:48.930
 They understood the question here close 

00:02:40.730 --> 00:02:54.120
 is also for production the area where 

00:02:48.930 --> 00:02:58.440
 a native forest hills where the bees 

00:02:54.120 --> 00:03:01.980
 do not have as much competition to collect 

00:02:58.440 --> 00:03:10.819
 next will not be too long 

00:03:01.980 --> 00:03:15.480
 is to stick with the model 55 modules 

00:03:10.819 --> 00:03:22.819
 we are proving that a lot of people are 

00:03:15.480 --> 00:03:35.209
 using is mainly for hobbies 

00:03:22.819 --> 00:03:39.660
 correct but here it is very well compact 

00:03:35.209 --> 00:03:42.829
 people in two or more food 

00:03:39.660 --> 00:03:45.870
 for Poland which may be under 

00:03:42.829 --> 00:03:50.639
 very close to the middle and the other two 

00:03:45.870 --> 00:03:52.819
 here is where we'll choose a little 

00:03:50.639 --> 00:03:52.819
 honey 

00:03:53.010 --> 00:03:59.939
 then we have presented the 

00:03:57.000 --> 00:04:03.599
 y four models a efe 

00:03:59.939 --> 00:04:07.980
 moreover a single model but with four 

00:04:03.599 --> 00:04:14.269
 sizes 9 modules with 6 positions 

00:04:07.980 --> 00:04:14.269
 horizontally and vertically 17 and 

00:04:14.659 --> 00:04:24.019
 compartments the internal measures to be 

00:04:18.590 --> 00:04:24.019
 You saw there , cool, China. 

00:04:32.710 --> 00:04:35.220
