00:03:01.360 --> 00:03:01.370 
installed and normally to which is

00:03:01.370 --> 00:03:03.119 
installed and normally to which is
actually<00:03:01.549> one<00:03:01.819> of<00:03:01.849> the<00:03:01.940> one<00:03:02.450> the<00:03:02.599> biggest

00:03:03.119 --> 00:03:03.129 
actually one of the one the biggest

00:03:03.129 --> 00:03:08.830 
actually one of the one the biggest
games<00:03:04.129> you<00:03:04.310> can<00:03:04.459> download<00:03:06.819> it's<00:03:07.819> also<00:03:08.450> one<00:03:08.810> of

00:03:08.830 --> 00:03:08.840 
games you can download it's also one of

00:03:08.840 --> 00:03:11.319 
games you can download it's also one of
the<00:03:08.930> most<00:03:08.959> graphics<00:03:09.440> intensive<00:03:10.099> so<00:03:10.940> as<00:03:11.150> we're

00:03:11.319 --> 00:03:11.329 
the most graphics intensive so as we're

00:03:11.329 --> 00:03:14.440 
the most graphics intensive so as we're
playing<00:03:11.659> this<00:03:12.819> you<00:03:13.819> can<00:03:13.970> see<00:03:14.090> it's<00:03:14.209> actually

00:03:14.440 --> 00:03:14.450 
playing this you can see it's actually

00:03:14.450 --> 00:03:16.690 
playing this you can see it's actually
the<00:03:14.629> GPU<00:03:15.079> the<00:03:15.230> Adreno<00:03:15.560> 305<00:03:15.920> is<00:03:16.220> doing<00:03:16.670> very

00:03:16.690 --> 00:03:16.700 
the GPU the Adreno 305 is doing very

00:03:16.700 --> 00:03:19.690 
the GPU the Adreno 305 is doing very
well<00:03:17.239> as<00:03:17.359> handling<00:03:17.690> all<00:03:18.049> of<00:03:18.079> these<00:03:18.700> explosions

00:03:19.690 --> 00:03:19.700 
well as handling all of these explosions

00:03:19.700 --> 00:03:24.099 
well as handling all of these explosions
and<00:03:20.599> garlic<00:03:21.170> is<00:03:22.000> that<00:03:23.000> the<00:03:23.150> laser<00:03:23.420> lights<00:03:23.840> the

00:03:24.099 --> 00:03:24.109 
and garlic is that the laser lights the

00:03:24.109 --> 00:03:26.080 
and garlic is that the laser lights the
adana<00:03:24.470> mation<00:03:24.950> of<00:03:25.069> the<00:03:25.220> of<00:03:25.549> the<00:03:25.700> characters

00:03:26.080 --> 00:03:26.090 
adana mation of the of the characters

00:03:26.090 --> 00:03:29.319 
adana mation of the of the characters
here<00:03:26.269> very<00:03:26.510> fluently<00:03:26.930> very<00:03:27.170> well<00:03:28.120> so<00:03:29.120> you<00:03:29.209> can

00:03:29.319 --> 00:03:29.329 
here very fluently very well so you can

00:03:29.329 --> 00:03:30.550 
here very fluently very well so you can
see<00:03:29.420> these<00:03:29.599> exposures<00:03:30.019> that<00:03:30.230> there's

00:03:30.550 --> 00:03:30.560 
see these exposures that there's

00:03:30.560 --> 00:03:34.449 
see these exposures that there's
absolutely<00:03:31.159> no<00:03:31.430> lag<00:03:32.769> it's<00:03:33.769> doing<00:03:34.310> an

00:03:34.449 --> 00:03:34.459 
absolutely no lag it's doing an

00:03:34.459 --> 00:03:43.050 
absolutely no lag it's doing an
exceptional<00:03:35.079> looks<00:03:36.079> very<00:03:36.319> clear
