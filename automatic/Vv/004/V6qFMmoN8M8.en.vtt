00:00:01.040 --> 00:00:06.149
 why are the second part more creating an animation with 

00:00:06.149 --> 00:00:07.610
 is listed 

00:00:07.610 --> 00:00:10.829
 in the first part we have the 90 pictures 

00:00:10.829 --> 00:00:13.829
 You can see here now 

00:00:14.859 --> 00:00:17.880
 in the directory at e10 

00:00:17.880 --> 00:00:20.339
 the senses and capable 

00:00:20.339 --> 00:00:23.339
 as received 

00:00:25.300 --> 00:00:29.260
 and now we want to make a video out of these pictures 

00:00:29.260 --> 00:00:32.570
 more unfortunately not succeeded directly on the sea 

00:00:33.120 --> 00:00:36.120
 Video files have been promoted with a program 

00:00:36.870 --> 00:00:38.340
 in format 

00:00:38.340 --> 00:00:39.640
 FLV 

00:00:39.640 --> 00:00:41.200
 that's the format 

00:00:41.200 --> 00:00:43.150
 that for example 

00:00:43.150 --> 00:00:45.820
 around 

00:00:45.820 --> 00:00:49.090
 on YouTube also uses great so all browsers 

00:00:49.090 --> 00:00:52.860
 the percent fixed can see this format 

00:00:53.750 --> 00:00:55.170
 but there are 

00:00:55.170 --> 00:01:00.170
 As far as I know, adding a movie program found scenes that 

00:01:00.170 --> 00:01:02.900
 Project out these pictures 

00:01:02.900 --> 00:01:05.500
 also like Geo m 

00:01:05.500 --> 00:01:09.590
 FLF put it on the format he says will give Moses a detour 

00:01:10.220 --> 00:01:13.710
 and I need another program 

00:01:13.710 --> 00:01:17.760
 I will then do a video and audio formats first 

00:01:17.760 --> 00:01:19.790
 and that was no different 

00:01:19.790 --> 00:01:21.640
 FFV format 

00:01:21.640 --> 00:01:25.090
 not used because two programs are free 

00:01:26.540 --> 00:01:29.520
 the first program 

00:01:29.520 --> 00:01:30.750
 called 

00:01:30.750 --> 00:01:32.110
 virtual allowed 

00:01:32.110 --> 00:01:35.110
 see the devastatingly degrading 

00:01:36.090 --> 00:01:38.590
 For that you can get documents in the cosmos 

00:01:38.590 --> 00:01:39.580
 that works for everyone 

00:01:39.580 --> 00:01:41.190
 very simple 

00:01:41.190 --> 00:01:42.770
 Mander 

00:01:42.770 --> 00:01:45.280
 click in the program 

00:01:45.280 --> 00:01:46.710
 free 

00:01:46.710 --> 00:01:47.549
 and then 

00:01:47.549 --> 00:01:49.670
 above video file 

00:01:49.670 --> 00:01:52.110
 and choose from that 

00:01:52.110 --> 00:01:53.790
 around 

00:01:53.790 --> 00:01:56.750
 Directory in which the pictures are all loading and 

00:01:56.750 --> 00:01:59.750
 an IPO 10 

00:02:01.780 --> 00:02:03.870
 and then you mark 

00:02:03.870 --> 00:02:06.220
 I'm learning it 

00:02:06.220 --> 00:02:07.999
 Bergamo will 

00:02:07.999 --> 00:02:10.999
 No marked the RP will be detected 

00:02:12.279 --> 00:02:16.499
 the first picture your opinion 000 rubles Gernandt in the forms further 

00:02:16.499 --> 00:02:17.620
 Ph.D. 

00:02:17.620 --> 00:02:20.429
 relined 

00:02:20.429 --> 00:02:23.179
 to two pictures are displayed 

00:02:23.179 --> 00:02:24.629
 and then you go 

00:02:24.629 --> 00:02:26.819
 again on Feil 

00:02:26.819 --> 00:02:29.749
 and then the same as Orpheus 

00:02:29.749 --> 00:02:31.159
 Video APA 

00:02:31.159 --> 00:02:33.199
 12 percent Hatfield 

00:02:33.199 --> 00:02:35.929
 and then of course I would too 

00:02:35.929 --> 00:02:39.249
 pack the directory to e-10 

00:02:39.249 --> 00:02:40.900
 and now the game has 

00:02:40.900 --> 00:02:45.180
 Taking part from the first picture will make that one easier again 

00:02:45.879 --> 00:02:48.879
 Manderscheid animation 

00:02:49.739 --> 00:02:51.499
 give ten points 

00:02:51.499 --> 00:02:54.499
 and who save 

00:02:56.089 --> 00:02:58.119
 that went 

00:02:58.119 --> 00:03:01.119
 "Now we have another one 

00:03:02.079 --> 00:03:05.079
 the directory 

00:03:05.759 --> 00:03:09.069
 the Turnaround Euro are probably at the end 

00:03:10.449 --> 00:03:12.759
 for this file to be shared 

00:03:12.759 --> 00:03:13.809
 cracked 

00:03:13.809 --> 00:03:16.599
 and she has a bigger one as you can see here 

00:03:16.599 --> 00:03:18.179
 of 30 command 

00:03:18.179 --> 00:03:21.179
 Liederbach 

00:03:22.149 --> 00:03:24.789
 and the dimensions are 400 times 300 

00:03:24.789 --> 00:03:27.789
 So the image's image size has been taken over 

00:03:29.329 --> 00:03:30.939
 That was the first step 

00:03:30.939 --> 00:03:33.599
 Now you could do this animation 

00:03:33.599 --> 00:03:36.599
 I also give up percent 

00:03:36.599 --> 00:03:39.729
 Bonn 

00:03:39.729 --> 00:03:42.769
 Of course, who wants to can control this at this point before you do that 

00:03:42.769 --> 00:03:43.779
 further 

00:03:43.779 --> 00:03:45.969
 untreated 

00:03:45.969 --> 00:03:48.969
 I mean now percent third program 

00:03:49.539 --> 00:03:50.829
 This is 

00:03:50.829 --> 00:03:53.829
 Pauli was 

00:03:55.409 --> 00:03:58.329
 you can do that in wrinkles otherwise 

00:03:58.329 --> 00:04:01.329
 get and and the store and install 

00:04:02.269 --> 00:04:04.279
 and that is very easy to use 

00:04:04.279 --> 00:04:06.589
 but that's a program life 

00:04:06.589 --> 00:04:10.930
 Percent arbitrary or different developing formats in St 

00:04:10.930 --> 00:04:12.779
 FL woman format 

00:04:12.779 --> 00:04:15.889
 by nine percent 

00:04:15.889 --> 00:04:18.889
 you have to specify that Kewell video 

00:04:19.469 --> 00:04:22.960
 and the palace 

00:04:22.960 --> 00:04:24.830
 just take a look 

00:04:24.830 --> 00:04:27.830
 that is somewhere on the process 

00:04:29.379 --> 00:04:31.039
 here 

00:04:31.039 --> 00:04:33.499
 to the tears 

00:04:33.499 --> 00:04:35.740
 so we can reject this 

00:04:35.740 --> 00:04:37.400
 Rittal 

00:04:37.400 --> 00:04:40.389
 after their 30 meters far 

00:04:40.389 --> 00:04:43.189
 that go 

00:04:43.189 --> 00:04:46.240
 the target directory is the same it let Kammerer 

00:04:47.020 --> 00:04:49.740
 with Kinect's participation 

00:04:49.740 --> 00:04:53.240
 now will also accept as 15 companies with the ending 

00:04:53.240 --> 00:04:54.590
 Be FSV 

00:04:54.590 --> 00:04:55.729
 and here 

00:04:55.729 --> 00:04:58.460
 when Lidl but if I can here you can 

00:04:58.460 --> 00:04:59.559
 size 

00:04:59.559 --> 00:05:01.629
 specify 

00:05:01.629 --> 00:05:03.029
 and around 

00:05:03.029 --> 00:05:06.779
 I had already preset to those times 300 there can be another one 

00:05:06.779 --> 00:05:08.180
 stand 

00:05:08.180 --> 00:05:11.800
 Per cent because I wanted to have that in size later I have them 

00:05:11.800 --> 00:05:14.800
 Images also generated in size 

00:05:17.559 --> 00:05:18.650
 then you came 

00:05:18.650 --> 00:05:22.240
 Basically it does not lead them on the same days 

00:05:22.240 --> 00:05:25.240
 a cow's her will 

00:05:28.349 --> 00:05:30.740
 I say 

00:05:30.740 --> 00:05:35.169
 Turks say the electorate is enough and given me a button and can 

00:05:35.169 --> 00:05:36.830
 immediately 

00:05:36.830 --> 00:05:38.819
 this file 

00:05:38.819 --> 00:05:41.819
 watch and percent in a player 

00:05:43.210 --> 00:05:46.210
 expire 

00:05:49.199 --> 00:05:52.199
 that's our animation 

00:05:57.960 --> 00:05:59.599
 Now look again 

00:05:59.599 --> 00:06:01.979
 at the end 

00:06:01.979 --> 00:06:03.999
 the file 

00:06:03.999 --> 00:06:05.680
 Size 

00:06:05.680 --> 00:06:09.719
 So this was again part of a leather ball with 30 command 

00:06:09.719 --> 00:06:12.719
 and now the FFH 

00:06:13.259 --> 00:06:15.229
 Divided FLV 

00:06:15.229 --> 00:06:17.139
 So she has 

00:06:17.139 --> 00:06:20.409
 6 and 38 CAD significantly smaller 

00:06:22.009 --> 00:06:22.840
 that is clear 

00:06:22.840 --> 00:06:25.189
 everything was for that 

00:06:25.189 --> 00:06:28.479
 simplified 

00:06:28.479 --> 00:06:29.619
 ratzfatz 

00:06:29.619 --> 00:06:31.749
 if someone has an idea 

00:06:31.749 --> 00:06:35.039
 Reminder Act of this bear episode 

00:06:35.039 --> 00:06:37.430
 Percent to a video 

00:06:37.430 --> 00:06:40.820
 FSV from the market is very grateful for which tip 

00:06:42.069 --> 00:06:44.400
 and then I wish everyone 

00:06:44.400 --> 00:06:47.089
 try it yourself have fun 

00:06:47.089 --> 00:06:48.550
 and who 

00:06:48.550 --> 00:06:50.029
 Lust has 

00:06:50.029 --> 00:06:54.240
 to show the yellowest created animation and has no place there 

00:06:54.240 --> 00:06:56.490
 if I have a place on my website 

00:06:56.490 --> 00:06:57.969
 and can do that 

00:06:57.969 --> 00:07:00.229
 or she can do that 

00:07:00.229 --> 00:07:00.919
 have fun with it
