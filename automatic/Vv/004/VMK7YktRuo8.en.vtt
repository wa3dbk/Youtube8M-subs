00:03:17.809 --> 00:03:17.819 
be trees so that's my thumbnail sketch I

00:03:17.819 --> 00:03:21.530 
be trees so that's my thumbnail sketch I
have<00:03:18.090> a<00:03:18.120> general<00:03:18.510> idea<00:03:18.780> of<00:03:19.019> the<00:03:19.200> layout<00:03:20.540> so

have a general idea of the layout so
here's<00:03:21.750> the<00:03:21.930> thumbnail<00:03:22.380> sketch<00:03:22.709> I<00:03:23.040> just<00:03:23.430> did

00:03:23.629 --> 00:03:23.639 
here's the thumbnail sketch I just did

00:03:23.639 --> 00:03:26.150 
here's the thumbnail sketch I just did
for<00:03:23.880> my<00:03:24.209> collage<00:03:24.620> you<00:03:25.620> can<00:03:25.769> see<00:03:25.920> that<00:03:26.069> I've

00:03:26.160 --> 00:03:27.979 
for my collage you can see that I've
already<00:03:26.340> started<00:03:26.790> cutting<00:03:27.150> papers<00:03:27.660> out<00:03:27.959> of

00:03:27.979 --> 00:03:27.989 
already started cutting papers out of

00:03:27.989 --> 00:03:31.520 
already started cutting papers out of
the<00:03:28.500> painted<00:03:29.010> papers<00:03:29.579> that<00:03:30.090> we<00:03:30.239> made<00:03:30.530> earlier

00:03:31.520 --> 00:03:31.530 
the painted papers that we made earlier

00:03:31.530 --> 00:03:34.370 
the painted papers that we made earlier
I<00:03:31.859> want<00:03:32.549> to<00:03:32.639> show<00:03:32.850> you<00:03:32.910> how<00:03:33.780> to<00:03:33.840> go<00:03:34.290> about

00:03:34.370 --> 00:03:34.380 
I want to show you how to go about

00:03:34.380 --> 00:03:37.030 
I want to show you how to go about
creating<00:03:34.769> these<00:03:35.670> architectural<00:03:36.480> shapes

00:03:37.030 --> 00:03:37.040 
creating these architectural shapes

00:03:37.040 --> 00:03:41.740 
creating these architectural shapes
we've<00:03:38.040> provided<00:03:38.549> a<00:03:38.970> number<00:03:39.480> of<00:03:39.660> pages<00:03:40.620> of

00:03:41.740 --> 00:03:41.750 
we've provided a number of pages of

00:03:41.750 --> 00:03:45.319 
we've provided a number of pages of
architectural<00:03:42.750> shape<00:03:43.290> templates<00:03:44.190> for<00:03:45.030> you<00:03:45.180> to

00:03:45.319 --> 00:03:45.329 
architectural shape templates for you to

00:03:45.329 --> 00:03:48.860 
architectural shape templates for you to
use<00:03:45.799> photocopy<00:03:46.799> for<00:03:47.280> your<00:03:47.400> students<00:03:47.910> and<00:03:48.090> cut

00:03:48.860 --> 00:03:48.870 
use photocopy for your students and cut

00:03:48.870 --> 00:03:52.640 
use photocopy for your students and cut
them<00:03:49.079> out<00:03:49.290> in<00:03:49.790> preparation<00:03:50.790> for<00:03:51.090> the<00:03:51.480> class<00:03:51.750> so

00:03:52.640 --> 00:03:52.650 
them out in preparation for the class so

00:03:52.650 --> 00:03:54.409 
them out in preparation for the class so
here's<00:03:52.889> an<00:03:53.040> example<00:03:53.160> of<00:03:53.669> one<00:03:53.820> of<00:03:53.940> the<00:03:54.000> patterns

00:03:54.409 --> 00:03:54.419 
here's an example of one of the patterns

00:03:54.419 --> 00:03:56.790 
here's an example of one of the patterns
so<00:03:54.829> it's

00:03:56.790 --> 00:03:56.800 
so it's

00:03:56.800 --> 00:03:58.620 
so it's
shape<00:03:57.130> that<00:03:57.430> I<00:03:57.460> think<00:03:57.760> I<00:03:57.880> might<00:03:58.150> be<00:03:58.180> able<00:03:58.570> to

00:03:58.620 --> 00:03:58.630 
shape that I think I might be able to

00:03:58.630 --> 00:04:00.810 
shape that I think I might be able to
use<00:03:58.870> in<00:03:59.200> my<00:03:59.230> collage<00:03:59.770> it<00:04:00.100> sort<00:04:00.310> of<00:04:00.340> fits<00:04:00.580> my

00:04:00.810 --> 00:04:00.820 
use in my collage it sort of fits my

00:04:00.820 --> 00:04:03.330 
use in my collage it sort of fits my
design<00:04:01.240> so<00:04:02.050> I<00:04:02.080> place<00:04:02.500> it<00:04:02.710> on<00:04:02.830> top<00:04:03.070> of<00:04:03.130> the

00:04:03.330 --> 00:04:03.340 
design so I place it on top of the

00:04:03.340 --> 00:04:07.770 
design so I place it on top of the
painted<00:04:03.730> paper<00:04:04.590> take<00:04:05.590> a<00:04:05.620> pencil<00:04:05.950> and<00:04:06.780> create

00:04:07.770 --> 00:04:07.780 
painted paper take a pencil and create

00:04:07.780 --> 00:04:19.650 
painted paper take a pencil and create
an<00:04:07.960> outline<00:04:08.320> just<00:04:08.650> like<00:04:09.220> a<00:04:09.250> dress<00:04:09.610> pattern<00:04:18.660> and

00:04:19.650 --> 00:04:19.660 
an outline just like a dress pattern and

00:04:19.660 --> 00:04:22.740 
an outline just like a dress pattern and
simply<00:04:20.350> follow<00:04:20.980> the<00:04:21.250> lines<00:04:21.489> and<00:04:21.790> cut<00:04:21.880> out<00:04:22.480> that

00:04:22.740 --> 00:04:22.750 
simply follow the lines and cut out that

00:04:22.750 --> 00:04:38.520 
simply follow the lines and cut out that
shape<00:04:35.910> so<00:04:36.910> now<00:04:37.090> it's<00:04:37.270> time<00:04:37.510> to<00:04:37.540> find<00:04:38.080> the

00:04:38.520 --> 00:04:38.530 
shape so now it's time to find the

00:04:38.530 --> 00:04:40.500 
shape so now it's time to find the
photographs<00:04:39.340> that<00:04:39.640> you're<00:04:39.760> going<00:04:39.940> to<00:04:40.000> add<00:04:40.150> to

photographs in my collage by cutting
them<00:05:02.260> out<00:05:02.380> and<00:05:02.680> then<00:05:03.160> placing<00:05:03.669> them<00:05:03.820> where<00:05:04.060> I

00:05:04.080 --> 00:05:04.090 
them out and then placing them where I

00:05:04.090 --> 00:05:06.300 
them out and then placing them where I
think<00:05:04.360> that<00:05:04.480> would<00:05:04.600> look<00:05:04.950> you<00:05:05.950> know<00:05:06.040> really

00:05:06.300 --> 00:05:06.310 
think that would look you know really

00:05:06.310 --> 00:05:08.640 
think that would look you know really
appropriate<00:05:06.580> and<00:05:06.850> great<00:05:07.180> so<00:05:08.020> I<00:05:08.050> started

00:05:08.640 --> 00:05:08.650 
appropriate and great so I started

00:05:08.650 --> 00:05:10.680 
appropriate and great so I started
building<00:05:08.860> my<00:05:09.250> collage<00:05:09.669> by<00:05:10.090> looking<00:05:10.419> at<00:05:10.540> my

00:05:10.680 --> 00:05:10.690 
building my collage by looking at my

00:05:10.690 --> 00:05:13.530 
building my collage by looking at my
thumbnail<00:05:11.140> sketch<00:05:11.520> started<00:05:12.520> placing<00:05:12.880> where<00:05:13.510> I

00:05:13.530 --> 00:05:13.540 
thumbnail sketch started placing where I

00:05:13.540 --> 00:05:16.670 
thumbnail sketch started placing where I
wanted<00:05:13.900> the<00:05:14.020> houses<00:05:14.410> to<00:05:14.560> go<00:05:14.710> and<00:05:15.010> I've<00:05:15.820> cut<00:05:16.120> out

00:05:16.670 --> 00:05:16.680 
wanted the houses to go and I've cut out

00:05:16.680 --> 00:05:20.010 
wanted the houses to go and I've cut out
two<00:05:17.680> people<00:05:17.980> on<00:05:18.100> the<00:05:18.220> tandem<00:05:18.490> bicycle<00:05:19.210> I<00:05:19.419> think

00:05:20.010 --> 00:05:20.020 
two people on the tandem bicycle I think

00:05:20.020 --> 00:05:21.780 
two people on the tandem bicycle I think
that<00:05:20.169> would<00:05:20.290> look<00:05:20.320> really<00:05:20.650> great<00:05:20.980> in<00:05:21.280> front<00:05:21.700> of

00:05:21.780 --> 00:05:21.790 
that would look really great in front of

00:05:21.790 --> 00:05:23.700 
that would look really great in front of
the<00:05:21.880> houses<00:05:22.090> that's<00:05:22.630> just<00:05:22.990> like<00:05:23.140> my<00:05:23.320> street

maybe of this house and by adding those

00:05:30.790 --> 00:05:33.720 
maybe of this house and by adding those
little<00:05:31.060> touches<00:05:31.240> I<00:05:31.750> will<00:05:32.260> create<00:05:32.770> the<00:05:33.460> sense

00:05:33.720 --> 00:05:33.730
