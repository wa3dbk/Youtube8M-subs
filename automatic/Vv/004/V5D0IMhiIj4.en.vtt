discussing points to go into when we're

00:00:24.570 --> 00:00:27.290 
discussing points to go into when we're
analyzing<00:00:25.140> this<00:00:25.260> one<00:00:25.609> first<00:00:26.609> things<00:00:26.880> first<00:00:26.939> I

00:00:27.290 --> 00:00:27.300 
analyzing this one first things first I

00:00:27.300 --> 00:00:30.349 
analyzing this one first things first I
thought<00:00:27.480> Bowie<00:00:27.990> Tim<00:00:28.320> who<00:00:28.880> weighed<00:00:29.880> in<00:00:30.119> and

00:00:30.349 --> 00:00:30.359 
thought Bowie Tim who weighed in and

00:00:30.359 --> 00:00:33.740 
thought Bowie Tim who weighed in and
looked<00:00:30.599> rose<00:00:31.380> to<00:00:31.560> be<00:00:31.650> good<00:00:31.859> athlete<00:00:32.309> he<00:00:32.750> looked

00:00:33.740 --> 00:00:33.750 
looked rose to be good athlete he looked

00:00:33.750 --> 00:00:35.720 
looked rose to be good athlete he looked
as<00:00:33.840> heavy<00:00:34.260> as<00:00:34.469> I<00:00:34.770> heard<00:00:35.070> that<00:00:35.309> he<00:00:35.430> potentially

00:00:35.720 --> 00:00:35.730 
as heavy as I heard that he potentially

00:00:35.730 --> 00:00:38.900 
as heavy as I heard that he potentially
maybe<00:00:36.590> you<00:00:37.590> know<00:00:37.680> he<00:00:37.770> didn't<00:00:38.010> look<00:00:38.160> like<00:00:38.430> he

00:00:38.900 --> 00:00:38.910 
maybe you know he didn't look like he

00:00:38.910 --> 00:00:40.940 
maybe you know he didn't look like he
had<00:00:39.120> completely<00:00:39.899> given<00:00:39.989> up<00:00:40.290> the<00:00:40.440> ghost<00:00:40.469> and

00:00:40.940 --> 00:00:40.950 
had completely given up the ghost and

00:00:40.950 --> 00:00:43.490 
had completely given up the ghost and
given<00:00:41.430> up<00:00:41.520> training<00:00:41.820> whatsoever<00:00:42.329> so<00:00:42.840> I<00:00:43.020> was

00:00:43.490 --> 00:00:43.500 
given up training whatsoever so I was

00:00:43.500 --> 00:00:46.369 
given up training whatsoever so I was
slightly<00:00:44.280> encouraged<00:00:44.940> when<00:00:45.180> I<00:00:45.239> when<00:00:46.110> I<00:00:46.140> saw

00:00:46.369 --> 00:00:46.379 
slightly encouraged when I when I saw

00:00:46.379 --> 00:00:50.090 
slightly encouraged when I when I saw
him<00:00:46.649> after<00:00:46.890> the<00:00:47.760> weigh-in<00:00:48.440> in<00:00:49.440> terms<00:00:49.860> of<00:00:50.010> the

00:00:50.090 --> 00:00:50.100 
him after the weigh-in in terms of the

00:00:50.100 --> 00:00:53.000 
him after the weigh-in in terms of the
fight<00:00:50.370> itself<00:00:50.879> how<00:00:51.180> it<00:00:51.329> kicked<00:00:51.600> off<00:00:51.809> to<00:00:52.800> prove

fight itself how it kicked off to prove

00:00:53.010 --> 00:00:57.020 
fight itself how it kicked off to prove
was<00:00:53.280> kind<00:00:53.579> of<00:00:54.590> using<00:00:55.590> tactics<00:00:55.980> I<00:00:56.460> guess<00:00:56.789> you

00:00:57.020 --> 00:00:57.030 
was kind of using tactics I guess you

00:00:57.030 --> 00:01:00.380 
was kind of using tactics I guess you
could<00:00:57.239> say<00:00:58.190> reminiscent<00:00:59.190> some<00:00:59.579> ways<00:00:59.789> of<00:01:00.120> a

00:01:00.380 --> 00:01:00.390 
could say reminiscent some ways of a

00:01:00.390 --> 00:01:03.410 
could say reminiscent some ways of a
David<00:01:01.109> to<00:01:01.559> earth<00:01:01.739> type<00:01:01.949> fighter<00:01:02.420> obviously

David to earth type fighter obviously

00:01:03.420 --> 00:01:05.479 
David to earth type fighter obviously
he's<00:01:04.019> a<00:01:04.049> slightly<00:01:04.379> lower<00:01:04.650> level<00:01:05.070> operator

00:01:05.479 --> 00:01:05.489 
he's a slightly lower level operator

00:01:05.489 --> 00:01:07.160 
he's a slightly lower level operator
than<00:01:05.760> David<00:01:06.119> to<00:01:06.299> her<00:01:06.450> I'm<00:01:06.570> not<00:01:06.600> saying<00:01:06.990> they're

than David to her I'm not saying they're

approached a fight you know who's trying
to<00:01:13.080> get<00:01:13.650> low<00:01:13.890> he<00:01:14.400> was<00:01:14.549> trying<00:01:14.640> to<00:01:14.760> use<00:01:14.880> a<00:01:14.909> lot<00:01:15.119> of

00:01:15.140 --> 00:01:15.150 
to get low he was trying to use a lot of

00:01:15.150 --> 00:01:17.090 
to get low he was trying to use a lot of
head<00:01:15.360> movement<00:01:15.390> he<00:01:16.320> was<00:01:16.439> trying<00:01:16.650> to<00:01:16.680> come<00:01:16.920> in

00:01:17.090 --> 00:01:17.100 
head movement he was trying to come in

00:01:17.100 --> 00:01:20.420

and<00:01:17.390> land<00:01:18.390> power<00:01:18.659> sorts<00:01:19.170> and<00:01:19.350> really<00:01:19.979> put<00:01:20.310> it

00:01:20.420 --> 00:01:20.430 
and land power sorts and really put it

00:01:20.430 --> 00:01:22.700 
and land power sorts and really put it
to<00:01:20.580> Joseph<00:01:20.970> Parker<00:01:21.420> very<00:01:21.659> very<00:01:21.930> early<00:01:22.259> on<00:01:22.290> and

00:01:22.700 --> 00:01:22.710 
to Joseph Parker very very early on and

00:01:22.710 --> 00:01:25.520 
to Joseph Parker very very early on and
test<00:01:23.369> his<00:01:23.549> mettle<00:01:23.759> to<00:01:24.750> be<00:01:24.869> fair<00:01:25.170> that's

00:01:25.520 --> 00:01:25.530 
test his mettle to be fair that's

00:01:25.530 --> 00:01:27.920 
test his mettle to be fair that's
probably<00:01:25.830> the<00:01:26.220> best<00:01:26.369> tactic<00:01:26.939> for<00:01:27.180> tapu<00:01:27.570> was<00:01:27.750> to

00:01:27.920 --> 00:01:27.930 
probably the best tactic for tapu was to

00:01:27.930 --> 00:01:30.859 
probably the best tactic for tapu was to
try<00:01:28.110> and<00:01:28.140> get<00:01:28.829> Parker<00:01:29.280> sucked<00:01:29.579> into<00:01:29.729> a<00:01:29.880> war<00:01:30.150> use

00:01:30.859 --> 00:01:30.869 
try and get Parker sucked into a war use

00:01:30.869 --> 00:01:32.980 
try and get Parker sucked into a war use
his<00:01:31.049> power<00:01:31.350> try<00:01:32.220> and<00:01:32.400> cut<00:01:32.579> him<00:01:32.790> out

00:01:32.980 --> 00:01:32.990 
his power try and cut him out

00:01:32.990 --> 00:01:35.120 
his power try and cut him out
realistically<00:01:33.990> the<00:01:34.200> guy<00:01:34.350> have<00:01:34.650> very<00:01:34.890> very

00:01:35.120 --> 00:01:35.130 
realistically the guy have very very

00:01:35.130 --> 00:01:38.270 
realistically the guy have very very
little<00:01:35.220> chance<00:01:35.790> of<00:01:36.150> out<00:01:36.810> boxing<00:01:37.409> pointing

00:01:38.270 --> 00:01:38.280 
little chance of out boxing pointing

00:01:38.280 --> 00:01:41.330 
little chance of out boxing pointing
Joseph<00:01:38.820> Parker<00:01:39.240> over<00:01:39.450> twelve<00:01:39.689> rounds<00:01:40.140> so<00:01:40.350> you

00:01:41.330 --> 00:01:41.340 
Joseph Parker over twelve rounds so you

00:01:41.340 --> 00:01:42.499 
Joseph Parker over twelve rounds so you
know<00:01:41.430> I<00:01:41.460> don't<00:01:41.610> think<00:01:41.790> it<00:01:41.970> was<00:01:42.030> necessarily

00:01:42.499 --> 00:01:42.509 
know I don't think it was necessarily

00:01:42.509 --> 00:01:45.319 
know I don't think it was necessarily
bad<00:01:42.780> tactics<00:01:43.380> from<00:01:43.500> him<00:01:43.680> um<00:01:44.100> now<00:01:44.820> in<00:01:44.970> the<00:01:45.060> first

00:01:45.319 --> 00:01:45.329 
bad tactics from him um now in the first

00:01:45.329 --> 00:01:47.749 
bad tactics from him um now in the first
10-15<00:01:45.840> seconds<00:01:46.530> of<00:01:46.649> the<00:01:46.710> fight<00:01:46.979> he<00:01:47.520> pretty

00:01:47.749 --> 00:01:47.759 
10-15 seconds of the fight he pretty

00:01:47.759 --> 00:01:50.719 
10-15 seconds of the fight he pretty
much<00:01:47.880> ran<00:01:48.360> at<00:01:48.570> Joseph<00:01:49.020> I<00:01:49.560> what's<00:01:50.220> the<00:01:50.430> the

but<00:01:58.500> it<00:01:58.920> was<00:01:59.040> ever<00:01:59.219> so<00:01:59.460> slightly<00:02:00.119> out<00:02:00.420> of<00:02:00.450> sync

00:02:00.560 --> 00:02:00.570 
but it was ever so slightly out of sync

00:02:00.570 --> 00:02:03.920 
but it was ever so slightly out of sync
to<00:02:00.990> footage<00:02:01.409> but<00:02:02.130> to<00:02:02.490> my<00:02:02.700> eye<00:02:02.729> he<00:02:03.270> appeared<00:02:03.659> at

00:02:03.920 --> 00:02:03.930 
to footage but to my eye he appeared at

00:02:03.930 --> 00:02:07.580 
to footage but to my eye he appeared at
one<00:02:04.170> point<00:02:04.729> bar<00:02:05.729> we<00:02:05.880> took<00:02:06.060> food<00:02:06.299> court<00:02:06.719> Joseph

00:02:07.580 --> 00:02:07.590 
one point bar we took food court Joseph

00:02:07.590 --> 00:02:10.490 
one point bar we took food court Joseph
Parker<00:02:08.099> would<00:02:08.220> quite<00:02:08.489> a<00:02:08.520> big<00:02:08.849> punch<00:02:09.470> when<00:02:10.470> he

00:02:10.490 --> 00:02:10.500 
Parker would quite a big punch when he

00:02:10.500 --> 00:02:12.480 
Parker would quite a big punch when he
sort<00:02:10.770> of<00:02:10.830> pushed<00:02:11.099> Joseph<00:02:11.430> Parker<00:02:11.819> back<00:02:12.000> on

00:02:12.480 --> 00:02:12.490 
sort of pushed Joseph Parker back on

00:02:12.490 --> 00:02:14.520 
sort of pushed Joseph Parker back on
ropes<00:02:12.640> and<00:02:12.910> it<00:02:13.270> was<00:02:13.480> interesting<00:02:13.900> to<00:02:13.930> see<00:02:14.260> so

00:02:14.520 --> 00:02:14.530 
ropes and it was interesting to see so

00:02:14.530 --> 00:02:16.140 
ropes and it was interesting to see so
obviously<00:02:14.740> Joseph<00:02:15.130> Park<00:02:15.370> was<00:02:15.610> coming<00:02:15.910> into

00:02:16.140 --> 00:02:16.150 
obviously Joseph Park was coming into

00:02:16.150 --> 00:02:17.910 
obviously Joseph Park was coming into
the<00:02:16.240> fight<00:02:16.480> cold<00:02:17.020> I<00:02:17.200> guess<00:02:17.380> you<00:02:17.530> could<00:02:17.710> say

00:02:17.910 --> 00:02:17.920 
the fight cold I guess you could say

00:02:17.920 --> 00:02:20.040 
the fight cold I guess you could say
like<00:02:18.220> it<00:02:18.730> wasn't<00:02:18.910> any<00:02:19.120> time<00:02:19.390> for<00:02:19.630> him<00:02:19.750> to<00:02:19.780> warm

00:02:20.040 --> 00:02:20.050 
like it wasn't any time for him to warm

00:02:20.050 --> 00:02:22.470 
like it wasn't any time for him to warm
up<00:02:20.230> and<00:02:20.440> he<00:02:20.650> had<00:02:20.830> this<00:02:20.980> guy<00:02:21.220> really<00:02:22.030> sort<00:02:22.450> of

00:02:22.470 --> 00:02:22.480 
up and he had this guy really sort of

00:02:22.480 --> 00:02:24.840 
up and he had this guy really sort of
running<00:02:22.750> at<00:02:22.990> him<00:02:23.110> charging<00:02:23.770> at<00:02:23.890> him<00:02:24.040> I'm<00:02:24.280> sort

of bringing the battle so it was

00:02:26.560 --> 00:02:30.210

interesting to see him initially Joseph

00:02:30.220 --> 00:02:33.120

seconds you know potentially this could

00:02:42.970 --> 00:02:45.510 
seconds you know potentially this could
develop<00:02:43.630> into<00:02:43.930> an<00:02:44.380> interesting<00:02:44.830> matchups<00:02:45.340> I

00:02:58.950 --> 00:02:58.960 
interesting poor car after about 20

00:02:58.960 --> 00:03:01.170 
interesting poor car after about 20
seconds<00:02:59.470> sort<00:02:59.710> of<00:02:59.770> settled<00:03:00.220> down<00:03:00.400> got

00:03:01.170 --> 00:03:01.180 
seconds sort of settled down got

00:03:01.180 --> 00:03:03.810 
seconds sort of settled down got
involved<00:03:01.510> into<00:03:01.900> his<00:03:01.990> box<00:03:02.260> in<00:03:02.620> was<00:03:03.460> able<00:03:03.730> to

00:03:03.810 --> 00:03:03.820 
involved into his box in was able to

00:03:03.820 --> 00:03:05.810 
involved into his box in was able to
keep<00:03:03.940> the<00:03:04.090> reins<00:03:04.330> a<00:03:04.510> bit<00:03:04.660> more<00:03:04.900> and<00:03:05.140> then

00:03:05.810 --> 00:03:05.820 
keep the reins a bit more and then

00:03:05.820 --> 00:03:08.100 
keep the reins a bit more and then
effectively<00:03:06.820> through<00:03:07.300> I<00:03:07.570> think<00:03:07.930> it<00:03:07.990> was<00:03:08.080> a

00:03:08.100 --> 00:03:08.110 
effectively through I think it was a

00:03:08.110 --> 00:03:12.000 
effectively through I think it was a
right<00:03:08.650> hand<00:03:09.510> which<00:03:10.510> just<00:03:10.780> collapsed<00:03:11.320> to<00:03:11.830> poo

00:03:12.000 --> 00:03:12.010 
right hand which just collapsed to poo

00:03:12.010 --> 00:03:15.090 
right hand which just collapsed to poo
now<00:03:12.670> when<00:03:12.820> I<00:03:12.850> first<00:03:13.180> saw<00:03:13.480> it<00:03:13.510> I<00:03:13.980> kind<00:03:14.980> of

00:03:15.090 --> 00:03:15.100 
now when I first saw it I kind of

00:03:15.100 --> 00:03:17.370 
now when I first saw it I kind of
thought<00:03:15.340> to<00:03:15.400> myself<00:03:15.840> what<00:03:16.840> on<00:03:16.990> earth<00:03:17.110> happened

00:03:17.370 --> 00:03:17.380 
thought to myself what on earth happened

00:03:17.380 --> 00:03:19.410 
thought to myself what on earth happened
there<00:03:17.770> I<00:03:17.800> didn't<00:03:18.160> actually<00:03:18.310> see<00:03:18.730> a<00:03:18.760> punch<00:03:19.060> land

00:03:19.410 --> 00:03:19.420 
there I didn't actually see a punch land

00:03:19.420 --> 00:03:22.020 
there I didn't actually see a punch land
and<00:03:20.050> I<00:03:20.110> had<00:03:20.320> towards<00:03:20.680> the<00:03:20.800> replay<00:03:21.190> five<00:03:21.580> or<00:03:21.790> six

00:03:22.020 --> 00:03:22.030 
and I had towards the replay five or six

00:03:22.030 --> 00:03:25.320 
and I had towards the replay five or six
times<00:03:22.110> but<00:03:23.250> Parker's<00:03:24.250> hand<00:03:24.460> speed<00:03:24.700> is<00:03:25.000> such

00:03:25.320 --> 00:03:25.330 
times but Parker's hand speed is such

00:03:25.330 --> 00:03:28.830 
times but Parker's hand speed is such
that<00:03:25.960> the<00:03:26.320> punch<00:03:26.560> was<00:03:26.680> so<00:03:27.100> quick<00:03:27.640> if<00:03:27.910> he<00:03:28.600> kind

00:03:28.830 --> 00:03:28.840 
that the punch was so quick if he kind

00:03:28.840 --> 00:03:32.040 
that the punch was so quick if he kind
of<00:03:28.870> what's<00:03:29.080> it<00:03:29.350> in<00:03:29.560> in<00:03:29.830> in<00:03:30.130> live<00:03:30.790> full<00:03:31.510> full

00:03:34.650 --> 00:03:34.660 
speed motion it is quite hard to get a

00:03:34.660 --> 00:03:36.270 
speed motion it is quite hard to get a
full<00:03:34.900> perspective<00:03:35.140> of<00:03:35.530> actually<00:03:36.130> what

full perspective of actually what
happened<00:03:36.720> but<00:03:37.720> essentially<00:03:38.140> this<00:03:38.290> hand<00:03:38.590> comes

00:03:38.790 --> 00:03:38.800 
happened but essentially this hand comes

don't have you seen my proof I video
you'll<00:05:46.790> probably<00:05:47.030> get<00:05:47.720> this<00:05:47.870> impression<00:05:48.170> but

00:05:48.640 --> 00:05:48.650 
you'll probably get this impression but

00:05:48.650 --> 00:05:50.320 
you'll probably get this impression but
I<00:05:48.860> never<00:05:49.190> really<00:05:49.670> viewed<00:05:49.970> him<00:05:50.090> as<00:05:50.180> a<00:05:50.240> threat

00:05:50.320 --> 00:05:50.330 
I never really viewed him as a threat

I never really viewed him as a threat
and<00:05:50.840> I<00:05:50.900> was<00:05:51.050> confident<00:05:51.590> park<00:05:51.860> would<00:05:52.100> get<00:05:52.250> a

00:05:53.800 --> 00:05:53.810 
care I didn't think it would come

00:05:53.810 --> 00:05:56.680 
care I didn't think it would come
quietness<00:05:54.470> quickly<00:05:55.070> but<00:05:55.340> nevertheless<00:05:56.240> you

know Parker's hand speed Parker's power

00:05:58.610 --> 00:06:02.530 
know Parker's hand speed Parker's power
is<00:05:58.940> a<00:05:59.090> threat<00:05:59.510> to<00:05:59.540> all<00:05:59.840> I<00:06:00.590> think<00:06:01.420> you<00:06:02.420> know

is a threat to all I think you know

though this fight was I let let me

though this fight was I let let me
phrase<00:06:10.820> it<00:06:10.850> this<00:06:10.970> way<00:06:11.180> I<00:06:11.210> don't<00:06:11.590> necessarily

00:06:12.580 --> 00:06:12.590 
phrase it this way I don't necessarily

00:06:12.590 --> 00:06:14.830 
phrase it this way I don't necessarily
see<00:06:12.830> suppose<00:06:13.220> a<00:06:13.400> step<00:06:13.730> up<00:06:13.910> in<00:06:14.090> opposition<00:06:14.660> from

00:06:14.830 --> 00:06:14.840 
see suppose a step up in opposition from

00:06:14.840 --> 00:06:16.300 
see suppose a step up in opposition from
some<00:06:14.900> of<00:06:15.170> the<00:06:15.230> other<00:06:15.260> fights<00:06:15.680> Park<00:06:16.010> has<00:06:16.160> been

00:06:16.300 --> 00:06:16.310 
some of the other fights Park has been

00:06:16.310 --> 00:06:18.340 
some of the other fights Park has been
in<00:06:16.430> with<00:06:16.580> previously<00:06:17.180> I'm<00:06:17.780> not<00:06:17.990> saying<00:06:18.290> it's

00:06:18.340 --> 00:06:18.350 
in with previously I'm not saying it's

00:06:18.350 --> 00:06:19.510 
in with previously I'm not saying it's
to<00:06:18.470> step<00:06:18.680> down<00:06:18.890> but<00:06:19.160> I<00:06:19.220> just<00:06:19.370> don't

00:06:19.510 --> 00:06:19.520 
to step down but I just don't

00:06:19.520 --> 00:06:22.120 
to step down but I just don't
necessarily<00:06:20.120> see<00:06:20.300> as<00:06:20.390> a<00:06:20.450> step<00:06:20.750> up<00:06:20.990> in<00:06:21.230> terms<00:06:21.950> of

00:06:22.120 --> 00:06:22.130 
necessarily see as a step up in terms of

00:06:22.130 --> 00:06:24.190 
necessarily see as a step up in terms of
where<00:06:22.280> he<00:06:22.430> goes<00:06:22.580> through<00:06:22.910> next<00:06:23.120> I<00:06:23.450> still<00:06:23.990> have

00:06:24.190 --> 00:06:24.200 
where he goes through next I still have

00:06:24.200 --> 00:06:26.710 
where he goes through next I still have
a<00:06:24.500> slight<00:06:25.250> concern<00:06:25.940> about<00:06:26.150> Parker

00:06:26.710 --> 00:06:26.720 
a slight concern about Parker

00:06:26.720 --> 00:06:29.080 
a slight concern about Parker
defensively<00:06:27.320> I<00:06:27.650> need<00:06:28.160> to<00:06:28.280> rewatch<00:06:28.640> to<00:06:28.880> fight

00:06:29.080 --> 00:06:29.090 
defensively I need to rewatch to fight

00:06:29.090 --> 00:06:31.480 
defensively I need to rewatch to fight
on<00:06:29.240> a<00:06:29.270> different<00:06:29.750> stream<00:06:30.080> it<00:06:31.040> was<00:06:31.160> unclear

00:06:31.480 --> 00:06:31.490 
on a different stream it was unclear

00:06:31.490 --> 00:06:33.820 
on a different stream it was unclear
whether<00:06:31.820> Parker<00:06:32.390> got<00:06:32.540> caught<00:06:32.930> early<00:06:33.620> on<00:06:33.710> in

00:06:33.820 --> 00:06:33.830 
whether Parker got caught early on in

00:06:33.830 --> 00:06:36.850 
whether Parker got caught early on in
the<00:06:33.920> fight<00:06:34.130> r40<00:06:34.820> probably<00:06:35.330> did<00:06:35.830> which<00:06:36.830> was

00:06:36.850 --> 00:06:36.860 
the fight r40 probably did which was

00:06:36.860 --> 00:06:38.620 
the fight r40 probably did which was
slightly<00:06:37.160> concerning<00:06:37.730> against<00:06:38.300> a<00:06:38.390> fighter

00:06:38.620 --> 00:06:38.630 
slightly concerning against a fighter

00:06:38.630 --> 00:06:39.310 
slightly concerning against a fighter
like

00:06:39.310 --> 00:06:39.320 
like

00:06:39.320 --> 00:06:42.370 
like
we<00:06:39.410> took<00:06:39.590> who's<00:06:39.830> so<00:06:40.040> early<00:06:40.340> on<00:06:40.430> in<00:06:40.580> a<00:06:40.670> fight<00:06:41.380> you

00:06:42.370 --> 00:06:42.380 
we took who's so early on in a fight you

00:06:42.380 --> 00:06:44.740 
we took who's so early on in a fight you
know<00:06:42.530> as<00:06:42.800> I<00:06:42.980> always<00:06:43.160> say<00:06:43.340> it<00:06:43.700> becomes<00:06:44.480> a<00:06:44.600> bit

00:06:44.740 --> 00:06:44.750 
know as I always say it becomes a bit

00:06:44.750 --> 00:06:46.510 
know as I always say it becomes a bit
repetitive<00:06:45.050> on<00:06:45.470> I<00:06:45.500> did<00:06:45.680> his<00:06:45.800> Joseph<00:06:46.160> Parker

00:06:46.510 --> 00:06:46.520 
repetitive on I did his Joseph Parker

00:06:46.520 --> 00:06:48.640 
repetitive on I did his Joseph Parker
videos<00:06:46.820> but<00:06:47.000> the<00:06:47.090> guy<00:06:47.240> is<00:06:47.270> so<00:06:47.570> young<00:06:47.870> such<00:06:48.620> a

videos but the guy is so young such a
bright<00:06:49.040> future<00:06:49.310> ahead<00:06:49.640> of<00:06:49.790> him<00:06:49.970> there's<00:06:50.480> just

00:06:50.680 --> 00:06:50.690 
bright future ahead of him there's just

level<00:07:05.900> operator<00:07:06.290> maybe<00:07:07.190> let's<00:07:07.490> start<00:07:07.730> moving

00:07:07.840 --> 00:07:07.850 
level operator maybe let's start moving

00:07:07.850 --> 00:07:11.080
