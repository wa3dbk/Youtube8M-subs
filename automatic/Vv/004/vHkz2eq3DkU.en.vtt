00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:06.180
 Tell me, what are you talking about? 

00:00:01.800 --> 00:00:07.680
 in the sky grid series and even strange to make 

00:00:06.180 --> 00:00:10.469
 introduction is so long here that I 

00:00:07.680 --> 00:00:14.730
 I do not do video and with you must have 

00:00:10.469 --> 00:00:15.599
 perceived grandson a time there disappeared 

00:00:14.730 --> 00:00:18.600
 from YouTube 

00:00:15.599 --> 00:00:22.890
 missing the missing English bishop and 

00:00:18.600 --> 00:00:26.060
 everything is complete and such but I'm back 

00:00:22.890 --> 00:00:29.340
 maybe I guess I do not know if it is but then 

00:00:26.060 --> 00:00:32.250
 here on the scar grid also about three months 

00:00:29.340 --> 00:00:34.649
 not make a video and last video that 

00:00:32.250 --> 00:00:36.750
 I did was in the series that's why I'm 

00:00:34.649 --> 00:00:39.090
 doing this video again I left my 

00:00:36.750 --> 00:00:42.239
 that an annual climate does not know if it 

00:00:39.090 --> 00:00:43.559
 really end the series or not that 

00:00:42.239 --> 00:00:48.690
 I was already talking about that era that 

00:00:43.559 --> 00:00:50.910
 was without time and such that if someone 

00:00:48.690 --> 00:00:53.190
 I had some ideas to do I would 

00:00:50.910 --> 00:00:55.890
 there with a new series such that until I 

00:00:53.190 --> 00:00:58.559
 I decided not to continue the series because 

00:00:55.890 --> 00:01:01.379
 although it does not live any longer than 

00:00:58.559 --> 00:01:07.290
 interesting to do and I'm here without 

00:01:01.379 --> 00:01:09.119
 have to do because rodak 

00:01:07.290 --> 00:01:11.970
 and I decided to stop because I did not have what 

00:01:09.119 --> 00:01:14.310
 and this will be going to continue to be 

00:01:11.970 --> 00:01:16.170
 a decision or is this here is going to be the 

00:01:14.310 --> 00:01:18.270
 last episode of the series 

00:01:16.170 --> 00:01:21.509
 and why am I making this episode? 

00:01:18.270 --> 00:01:24.540
 I left with the pilot who already counted 

00:01:21.509 --> 00:01:26.280
 It is that I want to leave here for the map 

00:01:24.540 --> 00:01:28.829
 download as I always do when 

00:01:26.280 --> 00:01:32.400
 The series ends and some people 

00:01:28.829 --> 00:01:35.869
 requested and although delayed there with the 

00:01:32.400 --> 00:01:40.680
 three months late here I'm going to throw 

00:01:35.869 --> 00:01:43.619
 but then I'll make another video from here 

00:01:40.680 --> 00:01:46.290
 it's a hope it does not take months more 

00:01:43.619 --> 00:01:48.689
 but if you explain better there speaking with 

00:01:46.290 --> 00:01:50.720
 It and this explains will be half 

00:01:48.689 --> 00:01:53.850
 disappearance from youtube 

00:01:50.720 --> 00:01:55.920
 I know I'll see if I can do it but I 

00:01:53.850 --> 00:01:58.320
 I want to do something else I want. 

00:01:55.920 --> 00:01:59.880
 do and make it come from another game but 

00:01:58.320 --> 00:02:01.290
 while only in this video here I just want 

00:01:59.880 --> 00:02:05.909
 to end this series 

00:02:01.290 --> 00:02:07.740
 so let's go the last of the episode as 

00:02:05.909 --> 00:02:10.349
 I told you leave the questions there for you. 

00:02:07.740 --> 00:02:13.140
 I had an idea to do that way. 

00:02:10.349 --> 00:02:15.560
 and if I hit that one and I did not see it 

00:02:13.140 --> 00:02:18.750
 what interested me enough to 

00:02:15.560 --> 00:02:20.970
 really continue the series and also 

00:02:18.750 --> 00:02:24.240
 spend that time missing from youtube and 

00:02:20.970 --> 00:02:26.130
 since stopping once and for all with this series of 

00:02:24.240 --> 00:02:27.900
 minecraft maybe I will continue with that 

00:02:26.130 --> 00:02:29.820
 island series that will now be several 

00:02:27.900 --> 00:02:32.310
 pib stayed well outside 

00:02:29.820 --> 00:02:33.720
 this is in those three months was 

00:02:32.310 --> 00:02:36.570
 disappeared think April minecraft 

00:02:33.720 --> 00:02:37.980
 which I once played type 2 minutes 

00:02:36.570 --> 00:02:39.780
 so I also out of the 

00:02:37.980 --> 00:02:41.040
 updates but maybe if I arrive 

00:02:39.780 --> 00:02:44.130
 some interesting things to do 

00:02:41.040 --> 00:02:45.780
 and that can give a climate worries that 

00:02:44.130 --> 00:02:49.500
 my island series 

00:02:45.780 --> 00:02:52.560
 if you remember but on this map that I 

00:02:49.500 --> 00:02:54.780
 a while ago and the pc and the mouth to 

00:02:52.560 --> 00:02:57.330
 download but no time to give a 

00:02:54.780 --> 00:02:59.970
 I reformatted the map and I sent a 

00:02:57.330 --> 00:03:01.590
 me and spoke of the honor arranged there gives 

00:02:59.970 --> 00:03:04.410
 touch-ups to stay cute little 

00:03:01.590 --> 00:03:06.690

00:03:04.410 --> 00:03:08.190
 showing what you have done and putting 

00:03:06.690 --> 00:03:09.000
 download is what I'm going to do in this 

00:03:08.190 --> 00:03:11.070
 video 

00:03:09.000 --> 00:03:13.170

00:03:11.070 --> 00:03:15.120
 so let's take a look here together 

00:03:13.170 --> 00:03:17.160
 I also remember how the 

00:03:15.120 --> 00:03:19.500
 Daddy let him show me. 

00:03:17.160 --> 00:03:22.950
 For him it's okay to create thanks to 

00:03:19.500 --> 00:03:23.790
 it by the basic reform and hay map 

00:03:22.950 --> 00:03:25.739

 things are still full here 

00:03:31.110 --> 00:03:34.410
 did you do it? 

00:03:32.130 --> 00:03:35.280
 It's there for you to do the way you do. 

00:03:34.410 --> 00:03:37.680

00:03:35.280 --> 00:03:39.570
 and it's okay here I remember it was a 

00:03:37.680 --> 00:03:41.910
 totally botched platform and the 

00:03:39.570 --> 00:03:43.980
 ask for everything arranged in luck than in the 

00:03:41.910 --> 00:03:45.600
 inventory just to be able to do it here 

00:03:43.980 --> 00:03:47.640
 to complete one of the goals not 

00:03:45.600 --> 00:03:48.150
 here the button is the woods and 

00:03:47.640 --> 00:03:52.230
 such 

00:03:48.150 --> 00:03:55.680
 these grades here the drugs gradis is 

00:03:52.230 --> 00:03:58.860
 this sixth stone that serve and botem 

00:03:55.680 --> 00:04:02.760
 As we enjoyed this lake here with good ice 

00:03:58.860 --> 00:04:06.000
 and I do not know how to stop it 

00:04:02.760 --> 00:04:08.880
 here the sheep quite boring visitors 

00:04:06.000 --> 00:04:10.769
 they are very noisy, have some idea and 

00:04:08.880 --> 00:04:14.730
 home he made a second to go dawn 

00:04:10.769 --> 00:04:17.100
 see the bottle come here and now it 's being 

00:04:14.730 --> 00:04:20.160
 given do not doubt ray drug 

00:04:17.100 --> 00:04:23.940
 look until then the stick not two hours 

00:04:20.160 --> 00:04:26.530
 in the same neighborhood is very little teacher 

00:04:23.940 --> 00:04:29.590
 only has one 

00:04:26.530 --> 00:04:31.540
 the slab here legal global are dry 

00:04:29.590 --> 00:04:33.100
 this is it, there are some things 

00:04:31.540 --> 00:04:35.530
 because we are so crowded here 

00:04:33.100 --> 00:04:37.389
 well organized thing 

00:04:35.530 --> 00:04:39.520
 here we will see here has a village 

00:04:37.389 --> 00:04:44.380
 Let's see if he did anything in the 

00:04:39.520 --> 00:04:47.740
 village does not have a place here in the 

00:04:44.380 --> 00:04:52.330
 by the way he just made the grid here and 

00:04:47.740 --> 00:04:54.160
 Look that's okay, but it stays 

00:04:52.330 --> 00:04:55.840
 here who wants to give a 

00:04:54.160 --> 00:04:59.980
 my initial idea was to make a city 

00:04:55.840 --> 00:05:02.320
 here with a chat starting point of these 

00:04:59.980 --> 00:05:03.970
 power here makes a city that I had 

00:05:02.320 --> 00:05:05.380
 Time for this, then what do you want to do? 

00:05:03.970 --> 00:05:07.450
 be free 

00:05:05.380 --> 00:05:12.100
 besides the cows I think they left nothing 

00:05:07.450 --> 00:05:14.800
 there I liked it if the squid only 

00:05:12.100 --> 00:05:16.960
 there is also that bad thing done there 

00:05:14.800 --> 00:05:18.910
 I hope it did not work 

00:05:16.960 --> 00:05:23.890
 let's let's go to see you if any 

00:05:18.910 --> 00:05:25.720
 It was not a big deal, too. 

00:05:23.890 --> 00:05:28.180
 I have lots of things that I'm going to do. 

00:05:25.720 --> 00:05:29.770
 it is the target will they change the 

00:05:28.180 --> 00:05:32.530
 line I think he took my oxygen 

00:05:29.770 --> 00:05:34.360
 hence this will work right 

00:05:32.530 --> 00:05:37.240
 I came here for a stone . 

00:05:34.360 --> 00:05:39.940
 to run vote on your all as 

00:05:37.240 --> 00:05:44.350
 were always there and the generator of 

00:05:39.940 --> 00:05:45.970
 oxygen and also must not fear 

00:05:44.350 --> 00:05:47.890
 if you leave my fields 

00:05:45.970 --> 00:05:49.419
 mainly for lipsticks 

00:05:47.890 --> 00:05:51.430
 Let's take a break here, too. 

00:05:49.419 --> 00:05:58.020
 be something and I think it stands for 

00:05:51.430 --> 00:06:00.460
 this for this video la plata prove here 

00:05:58.020 --> 00:06:02.789
 I think he came here behind 

00:06:00.460 --> 00:06:05.190
 something maybe with the study 

00:06:02.789 --> 00:06:08.460
 I looked at the girl that he made my god 

00:06:05.190 --> 00:06:13.020
 gets complicated here by med 

00:06:08.460 --> 00:06:13.020
 Let's go back to tighten the video. 

00:06:13.240 --> 00:06:17.389
 but then this is it guys I spent one 

00:06:15.530 --> 00:06:20.540
