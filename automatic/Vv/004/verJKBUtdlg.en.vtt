half<00:00:28.260> as<00:00:28.500> long<00:00:28.740> as<00:00:28.980> as<00:00:29.789> you<00:00:30.539> know<00:00:30.630> some<00:00:30.869> of<00:00:30.960> the

00:00:31.040 --> 00:00:31.050 
half as long as as you know some of the

when you get to the final weapon the
design<00:00:36.809> is<00:00:37.140> just<00:00:38.030> really<00:00:39.030> drab<00:00:39.390> you<00:00:40.110> can<00:00:40.260> kind

00:00:40.459 --> 00:00:40.469 
design is just really drab you can kind

00:00:40.469 --> 00:00:42.610 
design is just really drab you can kind
of<00:00:40.530> tell<00:00:40.739> they<00:00:40.860> were<00:00:40.950> phoning<00:00:41.309> it<00:00:41.430> in<00:00:41.520> because

00:00:42.610 --> 00:00:42.620 
of tell they were phoning it in because

00:00:42.620 --> 00:00:47.950 
of tell they were phoning it in because
it's<00:00:43.620> just<00:00:45.500> pretty<00:00:46.500> much<00:00:46.739> randomly<00:00:47.370> arranged

00:00:47.950 --> 00:00:47.960 
it's just pretty much randomly arranged

00:00:47.960 --> 00:00:53.270 
it's just pretty much randomly arranged
enemies<00:00:48.960> put<00:00:49.350> on<00:00:49.500> to<00:00:49.770> a<00:00:50.090> couple<00:00:51.090> of<00:00:52.280> various

00:00:53.270 --> 00:00:53.280 
enemies put on to a couple of various

00:00:53.280 --> 00:00:55.700 
enemies put on to a couple of various
platforms<00:00:54.059> and<00:00:54.270> there's<00:00:54.420> nothing<00:00:54.780> there's<00:00:55.620> no

00:00:55.700 --> 00:00:55.710 
platforms and there's nothing there's no

00:00:55.710 --> 00:00:58.240 
platforms and there's nothing there's no
real<00:00:55.920> variety<00:00:56.160> to<00:00:56.969> it<00:00:57.000> you<00:00:57.300> know<00:00:57.420> I<00:00:57.449> mean<00:00:57.750> sure

00:00:58.240 --> 00:00:58.250 
real variety to it you know I mean sure

00:00:58.250 --> 00:01:01.939 
real variety to it you know I mean sure
the<00:00:59.250> second<00:00:59.670> one<00:00:59.850> is<00:01:00.809> pretty<00:01:01.230> pretty<00:01:01.710> damn

00:01:01.939 --> 00:01:01.949 
the second one is pretty pretty damn

00:01:01.949 --> 00:01:04.549 
the second one is pretty pretty damn
hard<00:01:02.399> but<00:01:02.699> it's<00:01:02.940> not<00:01:03.180> hard<00:01:04.080> for<00:01:04.409> any

00:01:04.549 --> 00:01:04.559 
hard but it's not hard for any

00:01:04.559 --> 00:01:06.320 
hard but it's not hard for any
particularly<00:01:05.159> interesting<00:01:05.820> reason<00:01:06.180> it's

00:01:06.320 --> 00:01:06.330 
particularly interesting reason it's

00:01:06.330 --> 00:01:09.429 
particularly interesting reason it's
just<00:01:06.659> more<00:01:07.470> of<00:01:07.650> an<00:01:07.740> extra<00:01:08.189> six<00:01:08.430> tile<00:01:08.700> let's

00:01:09.429 --> 00:01:09.439 
just more of an extra six tile let's

00:01:09.439 --> 00:01:13.219 
just more of an extra six tile let's
let's<00:01:10.439> lay<00:01:10.650> out<00:01:10.799> some<00:01:10.979> enemies<00:01:11.340> and<00:01:12.110> you<00:01:13.110> know

00:01:13.219 --> 00:01:13.229 
let's lay out some enemies and you know

00:01:13.229 --> 00:01:16.520 
let's lay out some enemies and you know
pits<00:01:13.560> that<00:01:13.680> require<00:01:14.900> pixel-perfect<00:01:15.900> jumping

00:01:16.520 --> 00:01:16.530 
pits that require pixel-perfect jumping

00:01:16.530 --> 00:01:21.469 
pits that require pixel-perfect jumping
and<00:01:16.799> call<00:01:17.310> it<00:01:17.490> a<00:01:17.549> day<00:01:18.470> but<00:01:19.790> as<00:01:20.790> far<00:01:21.090> as<00:01:21.150> this<00:01:21.420> one

00:01:21.469 --> 00:01:21.479 
and call it a day but as far as this one

00:01:21.479 --> 00:01:25.370 
and call it a day but as far as this one
goes<00:01:21.900> it's<00:01:22.830> really<00:01:22.979> not<00:01:23.720> that<00:01:24.720> difficult<00:01:25.049> to

00:01:25.370 --> 00:01:25.380 
goes it's really not that difficult to

00:01:25.380 --> 00:01:27.980 
goes it's really not that difficult to
run<00:01:25.650> through<00:01:26.210> I'll<00:01:27.210> tell<00:01:27.450> you<00:01:27.540> one<00:01:27.659> thing<00:01:27.689> I'm

00:02:10.720 --> 00:02:16.500 
unenthused time to say the least so I
kind<00:02:11.380> of<00:02:11.440> took<00:02:11.680> it<00:02:11.740> as<00:02:11.980> it<00:02:12.130> was<00:02:14.700> anyway<00:02:15.700> it's<00:02:16.390> a

00:02:16.500 --> 00:02:16.510 
kind of took it as it was anyway it's a

00:02:16.510 --> 00:02:19.620 
kind of took it as it was anyway it's a
little<00:02:16.750> late<00:02:16.870> to<00:02:16.900> redo<00:02:17.290> it<00:02:17.320> now<00:02:17.620> but<00:02:18.630> the

00:02:19.620 --> 00:02:19.630 
little late to redo it now but the

00:02:19.630 --> 00:02:21.870 
little late to redo it now but the
second<00:02:20.020> one<00:02:20.140> goes<00:02:20.290> a<00:02:20.410> lot<00:02:20.650> better<00:02:20.920> so<00:02:21.280> stick

00:02:21.870 --> 00:02:21.880 
second one goes a lot better so stick

00:02:21.880 --> 00:02:24.390 
second one goes a lot better so stick
around<00:02:21.910> for<00:02:22.360> that
