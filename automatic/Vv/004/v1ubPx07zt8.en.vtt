00:01:17.450 --> 00:01:17.460 
see what its utility looks like in the

00:01:17.460 --> 00:01:20.090 
see what its utility looks like in the
starter<00:01:17.790> deck<00:01:17.970> for<00:01:18.259> so<00:01:19.259> let's<00:01:19.500> go<00:01:19.619> ahead<00:01:19.650> i'm

00:01:20.090 --> 00:01:20.100 
starter deck for so let's go ahead i'm

00:01:20.100 --> 00:01:21.320 
starter deck for so let's go ahead i'm
just<00:01:20.220> going<00:01:20.340> to<00:01:20.369> match<00:01:20.520> up<00:01:20.670> against<00:01:20.880> the<00:01:21.000> druid

00:01:22.820 --> 00:01:22.830 
because it's usually the easiest way to

00:01:22.830 --> 00:01:26.179 
because it's usually the easiest way to
kind<00:01:23.070> of<00:01:23.100> demonstrate<00:01:23.220> things<00:01:24.560> but<00:01:25.560> in<00:01:25.890> any

00:01:26.179 --> 00:01:26.189 
kind of demonstrate things but in any

00:01:26.189 --> 00:01:32.810 
kind of demonstrate things but in any
event<00:01:27.439> he<00:01:30.200> the<00:01:31.200> one<00:01:31.350> interrupt<00:01:31.799> image<00:01:32.130> via

00:01:38.090 --> 00:01:38.100 
terms of like they don't really get to

00:01:38.100 --> 00:01:41.149 
terms of like they don't really get to
 to<00:01:38.610> demonstrate<00:01:39.150> kind<00:01:39.390> of<00:01:39.979> what<00:01:40.979> they're

00:01:41.149 --> 00:01:41.159 
 to demonstrate kind of what they're

00:01:41.159 --> 00:01:43.550 
 to demonstrate kind of what they're
capable<00:01:41.340> of<00:01:41.729> without<00:01:42.600> the<00:01:42.780> expert<00:01:43.170> cards<00:01:43.470> as
