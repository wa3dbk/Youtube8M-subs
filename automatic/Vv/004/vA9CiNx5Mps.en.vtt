unfortunately<00:00:36.239> our<00:00:36.570> review<00:00:37.140> unit<00:00:37.410> seems<00:00:37.590> to

00:00:37.760 --> 00:00:37.770 
unfortunately our review unit seems to

00:00:37.770 --> 00:00:40.880 
unfortunately our review unit seems to
have<00:00:37.890> problems<00:00:39.290> so<00:00:40.290> we<00:00:40.379> don't<00:00:40.530> know<00:00:40.590> why<00:00:40.739> it's

00:00:40.880 --> 00:00:40.890 
have problems so we don't know why it's

00:00:40.890 --> 00:00:43.190 
have problems so we don't know why it's
saying<00:00:41.100> ce7<00:00:41.790> but<00:00:42.120> the<00:00:42.180> idea<00:00:42.510> is<00:00:42.570> that<00:00:42.719> you<00:00:42.899> plug

00:00:43.190 --> 00:00:43.200 
saying ce7 but the idea is that you plug

00:00:43.200 --> 00:00:50.450 
saying ce7 but the idea is that you plug
the<00:00:43.590> probe<00:00:47.600> which<00:00:48.600> is<00:00:48.750> here<00:00:49.129> into<00:00:50.129> your<00:00:50.160> meat

00:00:50.450 --> 00:00:50.460 
the probe which is here into your meat

00:00:50.460 --> 00:00:53.840 
the probe which is here into your meat
and<00:00:51.440> then<00:00:52.440> this<00:00:52.620> is<00:00:52.980> connected<00:00:53.610> to<00:00:53.699> it

00:00:53.840 --> 00:00:53.850 
and then this is connected to it

00:00:53.850 --> 00:00:55.459 
and then this is connected to it
displays<00:00:54.420> the<00:00:54.539> temperature<00:00:54.960> you<00:00:55.079> can<00:00:55.110> connect

00:00:55.459 --> 00:00:55.469 
displays the temperature you can connect

00:00:55.469 --> 00:00:57.350 
displays the temperature you can connect
it<00:00:55.559> to<00:00:55.680> your<00:00:55.739> iOS<00:00:56.129> device<00:00:56.520> and<00:00:56.910> it<00:00:57.030> will<00:00:57.149> send

00:00:57.350 --> 00:00:57.360 
it to your iOS device and it will send

00:00:57.360 --> 00:00:58.490 
it to your iOS device and it will send
the<00:00:57.449> temperature<00:00:57.840> back<00:00:58.050> we<00:00:58.230> should<00:00:58.260> be<00:00:58.410> able

00:00:58.490 --> 00:00:58.500 
the temperature back we should be able

00:00:58.500 --> 00:01:00.639 
the temperature back we should be able
to<00:00:58.620> view<00:00:58.859> on<00:00:59.010> your<00:00:59.160> iPhone<00:00:59.520> your<00:00:59.550> iPad<00:00:59.699> or<00:01:00.239> your

30<00:01:09.180> meters<00:01:10.970> now<00:01:11.970> operation<00:01:12.570> isn't<00:01:12.750> that

00:01:13.039 --> 00:01:13.049 
30 meters now operation isn't that

00:01:13.049 --> 00:01:14.870 
30 meters now operation isn't that
simple<00:01:13.530> and<00:01:13.619> you<00:01:13.710> turn<00:01:13.890> on<00:01:14.040> the<00:01:14.159> device<00:01:14.250> to<00:01:14.700> set

00:01:14.870 --> 00:01:14.880 
simple and you turn on the device to set

00:01:14.880 --> 00:01:16.460 
simple and you turn on the device to set
the<00:01:15.000> first<00:01:15.210> alarm<00:01:15.450> you<00:01:15.659> hold<00:01:15.840> the<00:01:15.960> plus<00:01:16.170> sign

00:01:16.460 --> 00:01:16.470 
the first alarm you hold the plus sign

00:01:16.470 --> 00:01:18.140 
the first alarm you hold the plus sign
that<00:01:16.799> puts<00:01:17.040> into<00:01:17.250> the<00:01:17.369> first<00:01:17.580> one<00:01:17.880> then<00:01:18.119> you

00:01:18.140 --> 00:01:18.150 
that puts into the first one then you

00:01:18.150 --> 00:01:20.149 
that puts into the first one then you
plus<00:01:18.450> minus<00:01:18.780> between<00:01:19.290> two<00:01:19.439> and<00:01:19.560> forty<00:01:19.770> degrees

00:01:20.149 --> 00:01:20.159 
plus minus between two and forty degrees

00:01:20.159 --> 00:01:22.609 
plus minus between two and forty degrees
and<00:01:20.460> on<00:01:21.420> the<00:01:21.540> converse<00:01:21.960> you<00:01:22.110> hit<00:01:22.259> the<00:01:22.380> minus

00:01:22.609 --> 00:01:22.619 
and on the converse you hit the minus

00:01:22.619 --> 00:01:24.469 
and on the converse you hit the minus
button<00:01:22.950> to<00:01:23.280> get<00:01:23.369> into<00:01:23.610> the<00:01:23.700> other<00:01:23.850> alarm<00:01:24.270> and

00:01:24.469 --> 00:01:24.479 
button to get into the other alarm and

00:01:24.479 --> 00:01:26.390 
button to get into the other alarm and
again<00:01:25.080> you<00:01:25.200> can<00:01:25.229> set<00:01:25.619> the<00:01:26.070> temperature

00:01:26.390 --> 00:01:26.400 
again you can set the temperature

00:01:26.400 --> 00:01:29.210 
again you can set the temperature
there's<00:01:27.360> two<00:01:27.570> ports<00:01:27.960> for<00:01:28.259> the<00:01:28.380> probe<00:01:28.619> right

00:01:29.210 --> 00:01:29.220 
there's two ports for the probe right

00:01:29.220 --> 00:01:31.880 
there's two ports for the probe right
and<00:01:29.460> left<00:01:30.110> which<00:01:31.110> means<00:01:31.140> you<00:01:31.439> can<00:01:31.590> use<00:01:31.740> either

00:01:31.880 --> 00:01:31.890 
and left which means you can use either

00:01:31.890 --> 00:01:33.440 
and left which means you can use either
side<00:01:32.250> but<00:01:32.400> you<00:01:32.490> can<00:01:32.579> also<00:01:32.729> use<00:01:33.000> up<00:01:33.150> to<00:01:33.270> two

00:01:33.440 --> 00:01:33.450 
side but you can also use up to two

00:01:33.450 --> 00:01:34.969 
side but you can also use up to two
probes<00:01:33.780> so<00:01:34.020> you<00:01:34.079> could<00:01:34.380> very<00:01:34.619> well<00:01:34.680> be

00:01:34.969 --> 00:01:34.979 
probes so you could very well be

00:01:34.979 --> 00:01:37.899 
probes so you could very well be
monitoring<00:01:35.850> two<00:01:36.240> different<00:01:36.630> types<00:01:36.840> of<00:01:36.990> meat

00:01:37.899 --> 00:01:37.909 
monitoring two different types of meat

00:01:37.909 --> 00:01:41.120 
monitoring two different types of meat
on<00:01:38.909> the<00:01:39.390> back<00:01:39.570> of<00:01:39.600> the<00:01:39.780> device<00:01:39.900> there<00:01:40.560> is<00:01:40.740> a

00:01:41.120 --> 00:01:41.130 
on the back of the device there is a

00:01:41.130 --> 00:01:44.179 
on the back of the device there is a
hook<00:01:41.960> it<00:01:42.960> allows<00:01:43.200> you<00:01:43.350> to<00:01:43.439> hang<00:01:43.619> it<00:01:43.770> from<00:01:43.799> stuff

00:01:44.179 --> 00:01:44.189 
hook it allows you to hang it from stuff

00:01:44.189 --> 00:01:45.380 
hook it allows you to hang it from stuff
so<00:01:44.369> you<00:01:44.460> could<00:01:44.640> hang<00:01:44.820> from<00:01:45.000> the<00:01:45.090> side<00:01:45.240> of<00:01:45.270> the

00:01:45.380 --> 00:01:45.390 
so you could hang from the side of the

00:01:45.390 --> 00:01:46.429 
so you could hang from the side of the
girl<00:01:45.570> though<00:01:45.750> they<00:01:45.899> warned<00:01:46.140> you<00:01:46.259> not<00:01:46.380> to

00:01:46.429 --> 00:01:46.439 
girl though they warned you not to

00:01:46.439 --> 00:01:48.050 
girl though they warned you not to
because<00:01:46.920> that<00:01:47.100> grill<00:01:47.340> will<00:01:47.490> of<00:01:47.549> course<00:01:47.670> be<00:01:47.790> hot

00:01:48.050 --> 00:01:48.060 
because that grill will of course be hot

00:01:48.060 --> 00:01:51.350 
because that grill will of course be hot
they'll<00:01:48.299> probably<00:01:48.329> melt<00:01:49.909> but<00:01:50.909> you<00:01:51.060> can<00:01:51.180> very

00:01:51.350 --> 00:01:51.360 
they'll probably melt but you can very

three<00:02:40.110> buttons<00:02:40.260> we<00:02:41.190> found<00:02:41.430> that<00:02:41.580> it<00:02:41.700> would

00:02:41.810 --> 00:02:41.820 
three buttons we found that it would

00:02:41.820 --> 00:02:43.729 
three buttons we found that it would
turn<00:02:41.970> itself<00:02:42.390> on<00:02:42.600> very<00:02:43.019> easily<00:02:43.080> which<00:02:43.590> we

00:02:43.729 --> 00:02:43.739 
turn itself on very easily which we

00:02:43.739 --> 00:02:46.070 
turn itself on very easily which we
didn't<00:02:43.950> really<00:02:44.040> like<00:02:44.310> but<00:02:45.150> enough<00:02:45.900> of<00:02:46.019> that

00:02:46.070 --> 00:02:46.080 
didn't really like but enough of that

00:02:46.080 --> 00:02:48.229 
didn't really like but enough of that
we'll<00:02:46.560> get<00:02:46.950> a<00:02:47.010> closer<00:02:47.250> look<00:02:47.489> right<00:02:47.730> now<00:02:47.940> and

00:02:48.229 --> 00:02:48.239 
we'll get a closer look right now and

00:02:48.239 --> 00:02:49.970 
we'll get a closer look right now and
then<00:02:48.510> we'll<00:02:48.630> have<00:02:48.720> a<00:02:48.780> full<00:02:49.470> review<00:02:49.650> up

00:02:49.970 --> 00:02:49.980 
then we'll have a full review up

00:02:49.980 --> 00:02:51.410 
then we'll have a full review up
hopefully<00:02:50.220> in<00:02:50.610> the<00:02:50.640> next<00:02:50.850> week<00:02:51.150> or<00:02:51.269> two
