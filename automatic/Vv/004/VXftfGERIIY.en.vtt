00:00:28.009 --> 00:00:28.019 
episode of this career mode later on

00:00:28.019 --> 00:00:29.450 
episode of this career mode later on
probably<00:00:28.349> around<00:00:28.560> half<00:00:28.800> seven<00:00:29.130> or<00:00:29.250> so<00:00:29.429> i

00:00:29.450 --> 00:00:29.460 
probably around half seven or so i

00:00:29.460 --> 00:00:31.099 
probably around half seven or so i
reckon<00:00:29.820> i<00:00:29.910> think<00:00:30.119> the<00:00:30.240> game<00:00:30.359> kicks<00:00:30.660> off<00:00:30.779> a<00:00:30.840> half

00:00:31.099 --> 00:00:31.109 
reckon i think the game kicks off a half

00:00:31.109 --> 00:00:34.220 
reckon i think the game kicks off a half
five<00:00:31.289> but<00:00:32.040> m<00:00:32.250> yeah<00:00:33.149> also<00:00:33.360> at<00:00:33.600> midnight<00:00:33.960> tonight

00:00:34.220 --> 00:00:34.230 
five but m yeah also at midnight tonight

00:00:34.230 --> 00:00:35.840 
five but m yeah also at midnight tonight
there's<00:00:34.440> a<00:00:34.500> slight<00:00:34.980> chance<00:00:35.010> i<00:00:35.520> will<00:00:35.640> be

00:00:35.840 --> 00:00:35.850 
there's a slight chance i will be

00:00:35.850 --> 00:00:37.580 
there's a slight chance i will be
uploading<00:00:36.030> a<00:00:36.329> brand<00:00:36.630> new<00:00:36.809> career<00:00:37.170> mode<00:00:37.350> but

00:00:37.580 --> 00:00:37.590 
uploading a brand new career mode but

00:00:37.590 --> 00:00:39.139 
uploading a brand new career mode but
that's<00:00:37.770> not<00:00:37.920> a<00:00:37.980> hundred<00:00:38.190> percent<00:00:38.370> yet<00:00:38.910> so<00:00:39.120> i

00:00:39.139 --> 00:00:39.149 
that's not a hundred percent yet so i

00:00:39.149 --> 00:00:40.280 
that's not a hundred percent yet so i
probably<00:00:39.450> shouldn't<00:00:39.719> have<00:00:39.840> even<00:00:39.899> said<00:00:40.020> that

00:00:40.280 --> 00:00:40.290 
probably shouldn't have even said that

00:00:40.290 --> 00:00:41.959 
probably shouldn't have even said that
one<00:00:40.410> thing<00:00:40.440> i<00:00:40.649> actually<00:00:40.920> wanted<00:00:41.100> to<00:00:41.160> say<00:00:41.399> at

00:00:41.959 --> 00:00:41.969 
one thing i actually wanted to say at

00:00:41.969 --> 00:00:43.220 
one thing i actually wanted to say at
what<00:00:42.180> you<00:00:42.300> guys<00:00:42.420> look<00:00:42.570> at<00:00:42.660> the<00:00:42.719> squad<00:00:42.930> report

00:00:43.220 --> 00:00:43.230 
what you guys look at the squad report

00:00:43.230 --> 00:00:45.470 
what you guys look at the squad report
is<00:00:43.379> that<00:00:43.890> it<00:00:44.010> looks<00:00:44.280> all<00:00:44.579> but<00:00:44.610> certain<00:00:45.059> now

00:00:45.470 --> 00:00:45.480 
is that it looks all but certain now

00:00:45.480 --> 00:00:47.540

00:02:29.420 --> 00:02:29.430 
because our form lately has been just

00:02:29.430 --> 00:02:31.850 
because our form lately has been just
absolutely<00:02:29.880> dire<00:02:30.690> and<00:02:30.989> we<00:02:31.110> really<00:02:31.560> really

absolutely dire and we really really

00:02:31.860 --> 00:02:33.320 
absolutely dire and we really really
need<00:02:31.890> to<00:02:32.130> do<00:02:32.250> something<00:02:32.520> about<00:02:32.730> it<00:02:32.940> because

00:02:33.320 --> 00:02:33.330

00:02:33.330 --> 00:02:34.940 
need to do something about it because
it's<00:02:33.510> just<00:02:33.600> not<00:02:33.750> really<00:02:34.140> acceptable<00:02:34.560> for<00:02:34.860> him

00:02:34.940 --> 00:02:34.950 
it's just not really acceptable for him

00:02:34.950 --> 00:02:36.229

00:05:44.570 --> 00:05:44.580 
like my instinctive like natural thing

00:05:44.580 --> 00:05:46.670 
like my instinctive like natural thing
to<00:05:44.820> go<00:05:44.970> is<00:05:45.000> that<00:05:45.390> way<00:05:45.600> but<00:05:45.660> whenever<00:05:46.110> they<00:05:46.470> go

00:05:46.670 --> 00:05:46.680 
to go is that way but whenever they go

00:05:46.680 --> 00:05:49.010 
to go is that way but whenever they go
that<00:05:46.890> way<00:05:47.010> I<00:05:47.039> go<00:05:47.340> the<00:05:47.490> other<00:05:47.520> way<00:05:47.780> it's<00:05:48.780> so

00:05:49.010 --> 00:05:49.020 
that way I go the other way it's so

00:05:49.020 --> 00:05:51.469 
that way I go the other way it's so
annoying<00:05:49.229> but<00:05:49.620> am<00:05:49.770> a<00:05:50.070> few<00:05:50.760> minutes<00:05:50.910> after<00:05:51.300> we

00:05:51.469 --> 00:05:51.479 
annoying but am a few minutes after we

00:05:51.479 --> 00:05:52.969 
annoying but am a few minutes after we
can<00:05:51.630> see<00:05:51.750> that<00:05:51.870> that<00:05:51.930> penalty<00:05:52.380> was<00:05:52.560> fine<00:05:52.770> hard

00:05:52.969 --> 00:05:52.979 
can see that that penalty was fine hard

00:05:52.979 --> 00:05:54.710

again<00:07:12.630> so<00:07:12.840> we<00:07:12.990> could<00:07:13.289> have<00:07:13.410> actually<00:07:13.710> taken

00:07:13.820 --> 00:07:13.830 
again so we could have actually taken

00:07:13.830 --> 00:07:15.409 
again so we could have actually taken
the<00:07:14.070> lead<00:07:14.310> and<00:07:14.460> completed<00:07:14.880> a<00:07:14.970> pretty<00:07:15.180> good

00:07:15.409 --> 00:07:15.419 
the lead and completed a pretty good

00:07:15.419 --> 00:07:17.510 
the lead and completed a pretty good
comeback<00:07:15.840> in<00:07:15.990> that<00:07:16.110> game<00:07:16.320> but<00:07:17.100> it<00:07:17.190> wasn't<00:07:17.490> to

00:07:17.510 --> 00:07:17.520

i'll<00:07:19.229> take<00:07:19.440> just<00:07:20.100> with<00:07:20.280> the<00:07:20.430> form<00:07:20.699> that<00:07:20.880> we're

00:07:21.020 --> 00:07:21.030 
i'll take just with the form that we're

00:07:21.030 --> 00:07:22.580 
i'll take just with the form that we're
in<00:07:21.150> now<00:07:21.180> i<00:07:21.360> don't<00:07:21.539> know<00:07:21.720> what<00:07:21.810> has<00:07:22.199> happened

00:07:22.580 --> 00:07:22.590 
in now i don't know what has happened

00:07:22.590 --> 00:07:24.950 
in now i don't know what has happened
and<00:07:23.250> it's<00:07:23.520> really<00:07:23.850> really<00:07:24.150> frustrating<00:07:24.810> for

00:07:24.950 --> 00:07:24.960 
and it's really really frustrating for

00:07:24.960 --> 00:07:28.610 
and it's really really frustrating for
me<00:07:25.020> excuse<00:07:25.740> me<00:07:25.889> that<00:07:26.669> i<00:07:26.699> can't<00:07:27.110> win<00:07:28.110> games<00:07:28.139> the

00:07:28.610 --> 00:07:28.620 
me excuse me that i can't win games the

00:07:28.620 --> 00:07:29.870 
me excuse me that i can't win games the
way<00:07:28.710> that<00:07:28.860> I<00:07:28.889> used<00:07:29.130> to<00:07:29.220> and<00:07:29.400> I<00:07:29.460> don't<00:07:29.639> know<00:07:29.699> why

00:07:29.870 --> 00:07:29.880 
way that I used to and I don't know why

00:07:29.880 --> 00:07:31.730 
way that I used to and I don't know why
that<00:07:30.090> is<00:07:30.120> I<00:07:30.270> think<00:07:30.630> it's<00:07:30.750> because<00:07:30.900> of<00:07:31.050> the<00:07:31.289> the

00:07:31.730 --> 00:07:31.740 
that is I think it's because of the the

00:07:31.740 --> 00:07:33.589 
that is I think it's because of the the
lack<00:07:31.919> of<00:07:31.949> defensive<00:07:32.370> stability<00:07:32.789> and<00:07:33.240> now<00:07:33.330> Cass

00:07:33.589 --> 00:07:33.599 
lack of defensive stability and now Cass

00:07:33.599 --> 00:07:35.180 
lack of defensive stability and now Cass
car<00:07:33.840> was<00:07:33.960> gone<00:07:34.080> out<00:07:34.260> for<00:07:34.560> another<00:07:34.889> three<00:07:35.160> weeks

00:07:35.180 --> 00:07:35.190 
car was gone out for another three weeks

00:07:35.190 --> 00:07:36.409 
car was gone out for another three weeks
with<00:07:35.520> an<00:07:35.639> injury<00:07:35.940> which<00:07:35.970> is<00:07:36.210> really

00:07:36.409 --> 00:07:36.419 
with an injury which is really

00:07:36.419 --> 00:07:38.390 
with an injury which is really
infuriating<00:07:36.690> as<00:07:37.110> well<00:07:37.259> but<00:07:37.830> I<00:07:37.889> think<00:07:38.099> when's

00:07:38.390 --> 00:07:38.400 
infuriating as well but I think when's

00:07:38.400 --> 00:07:40.310 
infuriating as well but I think when's
nicolaou<00:07:38.820> comes<00:07:39.090> back<00:07:39.360> and<00:07:39.630> that<00:07:40.139> we<00:07:40.289> have

00:07:40.310 --> 00:07:40.320 
nicolaou comes back and that we have

00:07:40.320 --> 00:07:42.260 
nicolaou comes back and that we have
more<00:07:40.620> options<00:07:40.889> and<00:07:41.220> a<00:07:41.340> bigger<00:07:41.520> squad<00:07:41.849> I<00:07:41.880> think

00:07:42.260 --> 00:07:42.270 
more options and a bigger squad I think

00:07:42.270 --> 00:07:43.670 
more options and a bigger squad I think
that<00:07:42.419> will<00:07:42.539> see<00:07:42.750> our<00:07:42.780> fortunes<00:07:43.260> pick<00:07:43.440> up<00:07:43.590> a

00:07:43.670 --> 00:07:43.680 
that will see our fortunes pick up a

00:07:43.680 --> 00:07:45.050 
that will see our fortunes pick up a
little<00:07:43.919> bit<00:07:44.010> but<00:07:44.490> that's<00:07:44.669> the<00:07:44.789> end<00:07:44.910> of<00:07:44.970> this
