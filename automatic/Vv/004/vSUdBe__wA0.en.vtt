the<00:00:26.820> same<00:00:27.000> main<00:00:27.269> frame<00:00:27.630> but<00:00:28.289> this<00:00:28.619> has<00:00:28.769> a

00:00:28.790 --> 00:00:28.800 
the same main frame but this has a

00:00:28.800 --> 00:00:30.410 
the same main frame but this has a
longer<00:00:29.220> length<00:00:29.400> for<00:00:29.699> the<00:00:29.789> boobs

00:00:30.410 --> 00:00:30.420 
longer length for the boobs

00:00:30.420 --> 00:00:33.530 
longer length for the boobs
it's<00:00:30.920> 666<00:00:31.920> millimeters<00:00:32.399> from<00:00:32.820> motor<00:00:33.149> center

00:00:33.530 --> 00:00:33.540 
it's 666 millimeters from motor center

00:00:33.540 --> 00:00:35.959 
it's 666 millimeters from motor center
to<00:00:33.809> motor<00:00:33.989> center<00:00:34.320> so<00:00:34.800> quite<00:00:35.640> a<00:00:35.670> bit<00:00:35.820> larger

00:00:35.959 --> 00:00:35.969 
to motor center so quite a bit larger

00:00:35.969 --> 00:00:40.220 
to motor center so quite a bit larger
than<00:00:36.149> the<00:00:36.300> 525<00:00:36.870> and<00:00:37.219> so<00:00:38.219> get<00:00:38.520> you<00:00:38.700> a<00:00:39.230> larger

00:00:40.220 --> 00:00:40.230 
than the 525 and so get you a larger

00:00:40.230 --> 00:00:42.290 
than the 525 and so get you a larger
platform<00:00:40.800> larger<00:00:41.340> base<00:00:41.520> for<00:00:42.030> your<00:00:42.120> clock

00:00:42.290 --> 00:00:42.300 
platform larger base for your clock

00:00:42.300 --> 00:00:45.110 
platform larger base for your clock
