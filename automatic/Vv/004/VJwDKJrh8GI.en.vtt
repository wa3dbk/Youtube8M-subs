00:00:00.770 --> 00:00:06.049
 greetings this is my first video tutorial 

00:00:03.609 --> 00:00:10.430
 Here I will explain how to use the 

00:00:06.049 --> 00:00:12.619
 starcraft brood war expansion without that 

00:00:10.430 --> 00:00:15.049
 annoying color failure that gives us the 

00:00:12.619 --> 00:00:17.960
 windows seven I did not try it on windows 8 

00:00:15.049 --> 00:00:20.410
 but he assured that the fault also comes out 

00:00:17.960 --> 00:00:23.030
 but it will be solved in the same way 

00:00:20.410 --> 00:00:26.090
 since our beloved game is made 

00:00:23.030 --> 00:00:29.030
 for windows xp the weak ones and they have 

00:00:26.090 --> 00:00:32.270
 left something abandoned and we will have 

00:00:29.030 --> 00:00:35.390
 problems with the new windows the trick 

00:00:32.270 --> 00:00:37.790
 is to eliminate the process of exploring 

00:00:35.390 --> 00:00:40.540
 point xxi which interferes with the 

00:00:37.790 --> 00:00:42.460
 handling of starcraft colors 

00:00:40.540 --> 00:00:45.760
 but if we eliminate this process 

00:00:42.460 --> 00:00:48.430
 we will be without home menu and it will be 

00:00:45.760 --> 00:00:50.410
 unusable the windows for which 

00:00:48.430 --> 00:00:52.660
 we will have to restart the session or 

00:00:50.410 --> 00:00:55.200
 restart the computer and that would be 

00:00:52.660 --> 00:00:57.340
 annoying to restart every time we play 

00:00:55.200 --> 00:00:59.890
 so here we have a simple 

00:00:57.340 --> 00:01:02.050
 solution create a file that closes 

00:00:59.890 --> 00:01:05.199
 temporarily the explorer text already 

00:01:02.050 --> 00:01:06.580
 he finishes playing I call him again and 

00:01:05.199 --> 00:01:10.030
 So keep using our computer 

00:01:06.580 --> 00:01:12.070
 as if nothing good we are going to do it very well 

00:01:10.030 --> 00:01:13.660
 this will be simple 

00:01:12.070 --> 00:01:17.320
 we started by changing some 

00:01:13.660 --> 00:01:20.380
 folder properties and we verify 

00:01:17.320 --> 00:01:23.619
 that the option of 

00:01:20.380 --> 00:01:26.770
 hide file extensions and this 

00:01:23.619 --> 00:01:28.420
 it will be to be able to put the extension 

00:01:26.770 --> 00:01:30.340
 corresponding to the file that we are going to 

00:01:28.420 --> 00:01:33.310
 create has to set activated 

00:01:30.340 --> 00:01:36.130
 check well that if it is activated what 

00:01:33.310 --> 00:01:37.940
 it's all section as I am 

00:01:36.130 --> 00:01:40.640
 doing any 

00:01:37.940 --> 00:01:43.250
 well then since it's ready those 

00:01:40.640 --> 00:01:44.980
 options we go to starcraft and open 

00:01:43.250 --> 00:01:46.940
 location where the files are 

00:01:44.980 --> 00:01:48.860
 another moment that is installed in the 

00:01:46.940 --> 00:01:50.600
 highlighting disc and that will be 

00:01:48.860 --> 00:01:51.590
 installed on the disc not on the cd 

00:01:50.600 --> 00:01:55.090
 because if it does not work 

00:01:51.590 --> 00:01:59.820
 well we created a file called 

00:01:55.090 --> 00:01:59.820
 Color fix point bat 

00:02:00.620 --> 00:02:04.820
 it can be any name but we 

00:02:02.990 --> 00:02:08.770
 we copy this code 

00:02:04.820 --> 00:02:08.770
 we hope then we keep 

00:02:09.039 --> 00:02:13.780
 we close this code you will find it in the 

00:02:11.590 --> 00:02:16.209
 description of the good video is already 

00:02:13.780 --> 00:02:19.900
 created the file that will allow us 

00:02:16.209 --> 00:02:23.690
 play we do a sdf shortcut or you 

00:02:19.900 --> 00:02:26.800
 we put a more pleasant name and 

00:02:23.690 --> 00:02:31.760
 we will change the appearance too 

00:02:26.800 --> 00:02:34.610
 because there is no image we will 

00:02:31.760 --> 00:02:36.320
 change your icon as you can see we are 

00:02:34.610 --> 00:02:38.900
 thus changing the search option the 

00:02:36.320 --> 00:02:41.870
 civic craft folder you get this spelling 

00:02:38.900 --> 00:02:43.400
 choose licona sacrifices him and simple and 

00:02:41.870 --> 00:02:46.340
 ready already with that I should already be able 

00:02:43.400 --> 00:02:49.900
 play starcraft with with the 

00:02:46.340 --> 00:02:49.900
 color problems solved thanks
