oncidium Carini theorem now hopefully I

00:00:16.710 --> 00:00:19.310 
oncidium Carini theorem now hopefully I
pronounced<00:00:17.220> them<00:00:17.340> correctly<00:00:18.230> apparently<00:00:19.230> it

00:00:19.310 --> 00:00:19.320 
pronounced them correctly apparently it

00:00:19.320 --> 00:00:22.790 
pronounced them correctly apparently it
was<00:00:19.410> registered<00:00:20.010> quite<00:00:20.400> recently<00:00:20.850> in<00:00:21.800> 2007

00:00:22.790 --> 00:00:22.800 
was registered quite recently in 2007

00:00:22.800 --> 00:00:25.429 
was registered quite recently in 2007
and<00:00:22.980> as<00:00:23.369> you<00:00:23.460> can<00:00:23.609> see<00:00:23.910> this<00:00:24.119> orchid<00:00:24.510> is<00:00:24.810> almost

00:00:25.429 --> 00:00:25.439 
and as you can see this orchid is almost

00:00:25.439 --> 00:00:27.980 
and as you can see this orchid is almost
black<00:00:25.890> in<00:00:26.160> color<00:00:26.400> which<00:00:26.820> is<00:00:27.090> kind<00:00:27.570> of<00:00:27.599> peculiar

00:00:27.980 --> 00:00:27.990 
black in color which is kind of peculiar

00:00:27.990 --> 00:00:30.679 
black in color which is kind of peculiar
because<00:00:28.410> the<00:00:28.529> parents<00:00:29.269> really<00:00:30.269> don't<00:00:30.420> look

00:00:30.679 --> 00:00:30.689 
because the parents really don't look

00:00:30.689 --> 00:00:32.479 
because the parents really don't look
like<00:00:30.869> this<00:00:31.080> or<00:00:31.349> if<00:00:31.769> you<00:00:31.859> see<00:00:32.070> them<00:00:32.279> you

00:00:32.479 --> 00:00:32.489 
like this or if you see them you

00:00:32.489 --> 00:00:33.950 
like this or if you see them you
wouldn't<00:00:32.820> say<00:00:33.090> something<00:00:33.329> like<00:00:33.570> this<00:00:33.750> can

00:00:33.950 --> 00:00:33.960 
wouldn't say something like this can

00:00:33.960 --> 00:00:37.310 
wouldn't say something like this can
come<00:00:34.170> up<00:00:34.320> out<00:00:35.130> of<00:00:35.399> them<00:00:35.579> but<00:00:36.329> apparently<00:00:36.570> it

00:00:37.310 --> 00:00:37.320 
come up out of them but apparently it

00:00:37.320 --> 00:00:40.340 
come up out of them but apparently it
did<00:00:37.829> now<00:00:38.370> a<00:00:38.399> few<00:00:38.640> words<00:00:38.760> on<00:00:39.030> this<00:00:39.360> orchid<00:00:39.570> being

00:00:40.340 --> 00:00:40.350 
did now a few words on this orchid being

00:00:40.350 --> 00:00:41.869 
did now a few words on this orchid being
that<00:00:40.530> it's<00:00:40.649> a<00:00:40.739> nonce<00:00:40.890> idiom<00:00:41.190> hybrid<00:00:41.640> it<00:00:41.820> does

00:00:41.869 --> 00:00:41.879 
that it's a nonce idiom hybrid it does

00:00:41.879 --> 00:00:44.240 
that it's a nonce idiom hybrid it does
take<00:00:42.480> quite<00:00:42.750> the<00:00:42.989> same<00:00:43.200> care<00:00:43.500> as<00:00:43.620> an<00:00:43.770> oncidium

00:00:44.240 --> 00:00:44.250 
take quite the same care as an oncidium

00:00:44.250 --> 00:00:46.840 
take quite the same care as an oncidium
which<00:00:44.789> means<00:00:45.030> it<00:00:45.180> likes<00:00:45.390> really<00:00:45.840> bright<00:00:46.140> light

00:00:46.840 --> 00:00:46.850 
which means it likes really bright light

00:00:46.850 --> 00:00:49.250 
which means it likes really bright light
careful<00:00:47.850> with<00:00:48.000> direct<00:00:48.329> sunlight<00:00:48.539> and<00:00:49.020> just

00:00:49.250 --> 00:00:49.260 
careful with direct sunlight and just

00:00:49.260 --> 00:00:51.020 
careful with direct sunlight and just
try<00:00:49.500> to<00:00:49.530> adjust<00:00:49.829> the<00:00:50.160> plant<00:00:50.370> first<00:00:50.700> before

00:00:51.020 --> 00:00:51.030 
try to adjust the plant first before

00:00:51.030 --> 00:00:55.069 
try to adjust the plant first before
giving<00:00:51.870> it<00:00:52.020> direct<00:00:52.440> sunlight<00:00:52.730> for<00:00:53.809> more<00:00:54.809> than

00:00:55.069 --> 00:00:55.079 
giving it direct sunlight for more than

00:00:55.079 --> 00:00:58.340 
giving it direct sunlight for more than
five<00:00:55.860> four<00:00:56.370> or<00:00:56.520> five<00:00:56.699> hours<00:00:57.030> per<00:00:57.090> day<00:00:57.390> usually

00:00:58.340 --> 00:00:58.350 
five four or five hours per day usually

00:00:58.350 --> 00:01:00.740 
five four or five hours per day usually
the<00:00:58.590> best<00:00:58.770> direct<00:00:59.579> Sun<00:00:59.789> is<00:00:59.969> in<00:01:00.149> the<00:01:00.270> morning<00:01:00.480> so

00:01:00.740 --> 00:01:00.750 
the best direct Sun is in the morning so

00:01:00.750 --> 00:01:02.090 
the best direct Sun is in the morning so
if<00:01:00.870> you<00:01:00.960> can<00:01:01.109> provide<00:01:01.260> something<00:01:01.800> like<00:01:01.920> that

00:01:02.090 --> 00:01:02.100 
if you can provide something like that

00:01:02.100 --> 00:01:05.479 
if you can provide something like that
it<00:01:02.370> would<00:01:02.579> be<00:01:02.850> great<00:01:03.780> now<00:01:04.739> another<00:01:05.010> thing<00:01:05.100> with

00:01:05.479 --> 00:01:05.489 
it would be great now another thing with

00:01:05.489 --> 00:01:07.940 
it would be great now another thing with
this<00:01:05.640> orchid<00:01:06.090> is<00:01:06.299> that<00:01:06.540> it<00:01:06.630> produces<00:01:06.950> massive

00:01:07.940 --> 00:01:07.950 
this orchid is that it produces massive

00:01:07.950 --> 00:01:10.760 
this orchid is that it produces massive
pseudobulbs<00:01:08.939> which<00:01:09.479> I<00:01:09.630> quite<00:01:09.840> like<00:01:10.140> but<00:01:10.590> it

00:01:10.760 --> 00:01:10.770 
pseudobulbs which I quite like but it

00:01:10.770 --> 00:01:13.550 
pseudobulbs which I quite like but it
tends<00:01:11.430> to<00:01:11.549> get<00:01:11.760> quite<00:01:12.060> large<00:01:12.299> so<00:01:12.780> as<00:01:13.350> you<00:01:13.439> can

00:01:13.550 --> 00:01:13.560 
tends to get quite large so as you can

00:01:13.560 --> 00:01:15.320 
tends to get quite large so as you can
see<00:01:13.710> the<00:01:13.830> roots<00:01:14.010> are<00:01:14.220> quite<00:01:14.549> thick<00:01:14.909> as<00:01:15.090> well

00:01:15.320 --> 00:01:15.330 
see the roots are quite thick as well

00:01:15.330 --> 00:01:17.950 
see the roots are quite thick as well
which<00:01:15.869> means<00:01:16.170> it<00:01:16.830> can<00:01:17.040> tolerate<00:01:17.220> drought

00:01:17.950 --> 00:01:17.960 
which means it can tolerate drought

00:01:17.960 --> 00:01:20.810 
which means it can tolerate drought
better<00:01:18.960> than<00:01:19.290> a<00:01:19.320> non<00:01:19.650> CDM<00:01:19.979> that<00:01:20.130> has<00:01:20.340> pretty

00:01:20.810 --> 00:01:20.820 
better than a non CDM that has pretty

00:01:20.820 --> 00:01:23.600 
better than a non CDM that has pretty
thin<00:01:21.119> roots<00:01:21.600> so<00:01:22.170> I<00:01:22.200> wouldn't<00:01:22.590> really<00:01:23.220> worry

00:01:23.600 --> 00:01:23.610 
thin roots so I wouldn't really worry

00:01:23.610 --> 00:01:26.510 
thin roots so I wouldn't really worry
about<00:01:23.700> moisture<00:01:24.390> try<00:01:24.630> to<00:01:24.689> keep<00:01:25.020> it<00:01:25.520> slightly

00:01:26.510 --> 00:01:26.520 
about moisture try to keep it slightly

00:01:26.520 --> 00:01:28.789 
about moisture try to keep it slightly
moist<00:01:26.970> when<00:01:27.270> you<00:01:27.360> see<00:01:27.570> the<00:01:27.720> medium<00:01:28.110> on<00:01:28.380> the<00:01:28.590> top

00:01:28.789 --> 00:01:28.799 
moist when you see the medium on the top

00:01:28.799 --> 00:01:31.160 
moist when you see the medium on the top
is<00:01:29.009> really<00:01:29.250> dry<00:01:29.640> then<00:01:30.509> it's<00:01:30.659> definitely<00:01:30.990> time

00:01:31.160 --> 00:01:31.170 
is really dry then it's definitely time

00:01:31.170 --> 00:01:33.740 
is really dry then it's definitely time
to<00:01:31.350> water<00:01:31.530> it<00:01:32.150> but<00:01:33.150> yeah<00:01:33.390> just<00:01:33.570> be<00:01:33.720> careful

00:01:33.740 --> 00:01:33.750 
to water it but yeah just be careful

00:01:33.750 --> 00:01:36.170 
to water it but yeah just be careful
that<00:01:34.560> you<00:01:34.710> don't<00:01:34.740> get<00:01:35.070> really<00:01:35.430> wrinkled

00:01:36.170 --> 00:01:36.180 
that you don't get really wrinkled

00:01:36.180 --> 00:01:39.170 
that you don't get really wrinkled
leaves<00:01:36.479> I<00:01:36.829> would<00:01:37.829> say<00:01:38.040> what<00:01:38.549> do<00:01:38.610> I<00:01:38.670> get<00:01:38.909> when

00:01:39.170 --> 00:01:39.180 
leaves I would say what do I get when

00:01:39.180 --> 00:01:41.450 
leaves I would say what do I get when
the<00:01:39.420> medium<00:01:39.780> is<00:01:39.990> almost<00:01:40.680> completely<00:01:41.100> bone<00:01:41.430> dry

00:01:41.450 --> 00:01:41.460 
the medium is almost completely bone dry

00:01:41.460 --> 00:01:44.030 
the medium is almost completely bone dry
would<00:01:42.119> be<00:01:42.299> okay<00:01:42.780> but<00:01:42.990> don't<00:01:43.140> let<00:01:43.350> it<00:01:43.470> dry<00:01:44.009> for

00:01:44.030 --> 00:01:44.040 
would be okay but don't let it dry for

00:01:44.040 --> 00:01:47.960 
would be okay but don't let it dry for
too<00:01:44.460> many<00:01:44.670> days<00:01:45.649> okay<00:01:46.649> so<00:01:47.280> this<00:01:47.640> orchid

00:01:47.960 --> 00:01:47.970 
too many days okay so this orchid

00:01:47.970 --> 00:01:51.469 
too many days okay so this orchid
unfortunately<00:01:48.479> is<00:01:48.630> not<00:01:49.130> fragrant<00:01:50.130> but<00:01:51.119> it's

00:01:51.469 --> 00:01:51.479 
unfortunately is not fragrant but it's

00:01:51.479 --> 00:01:53.719 
unfortunately is not fragrant but it's
okay<00:01:51.899> and<00:01:52.170> I<00:01:52.590> don't<00:01:52.680> know<00:01:52.860> why<00:01:53.009> but<00:01:53.189> under<00:01:53.549> this

00:01:53.719 --> 00:01:53.729 
okay and I don't know why but under this

00:01:53.729 --> 00:01:55.490 
okay and I don't know why but under this
light<00:01:53.970> it<00:01:54.149> seems<00:01:54.360> more<00:01:54.659> red<00:01:54.990> than<00:01:55.020> it<00:01:55.380> actually

00:01:55.490 --> 00:01:55.500 
light it seems more red than it actually

00:01:55.500 --> 00:01:58.310 
light it seems more red than it actually
is<00:01:55.950> the<00:01:56.670> colour<00:01:56.939> in<00:01:57.270> reality<00:01:57.840> is<00:01:58.020> much<00:01:58.259> more

00:01:58.310 --> 00:01:58.320 
is the colour in reality is much more
