00:01:50.450 --> 00:01:50.460 
glass unit you know so it's very easily

who's new or for someone that's looking

00:01:58.979 --> 00:02:00.950 
who's new or for someone that's looking
to<00:01:59.219> play<00:01:59.399> the<00:01:59.490> game<00:01:59.640> in<00:01:59.820> a<00:01:59.969> rushing<00:02:00.420> style<00:02:00.750> or<00:02:00.899> a

00:02:00.950 --> 00:02:00.960 
to play the game in a rushing style or a

00:02:00.960 --> 00:02:03.260 
to play the game in a rushing style or a
all-out<00:02:01.710> war<00:02:02.219> type<00:02:02.490> of<00:02:02.670> style<00:02:02.820> of<00:02:03.000> gameplay

00:02:03.260 --> 00:02:03.270 
all-out war type of style of gameplay

00:02:03.270 --> 00:02:06.020 
all-out war type of style of gameplay
now<00:02:04.020> the<00:02:04.079> world<00:02:04.439> class<00:02:04.710> consists<00:02:05.399> has<00:02:05.790> a

00:02:06.020 --> 00:02:06.030 
now the world class consists has a

00:02:06.030 --> 00:02:07.910 
now the world class consists has a
double<00:02:06.479> jump<00:02:06.630> the<00:02:07.140> double<00:02:07.469> jump<00:02:07.649> does

00:02:07.910 --> 00:02:07.920 
double jump the double jump does

00:02:07.920 --> 00:02:10.160 
double jump the double jump does
simulate<00:02:08.580> something<00:02:09.030> similar<00:02:09.539> to<00:02:10.050> the

00:02:10.160 --> 00:02:10.170 
simulate something similar to the

00:02:10.170 --> 00:02:11.600 
simulate something similar to the
majority<00:02:10.619> of<00:02:10.649> the<00:02:10.739> classes<00:02:11.009> but<00:02:11.190> this<00:02:11.370> class

00:02:11.600 --> 00:02:11.610 
majority of the classes but this class

00:02:11.610 --> 00:02:13.880 
majority of the classes but this class
tends<00:02:12.000> to<00:02:12.180> have<00:02:12.540> a<00:02:12.690> more<00:02:12.959> of<00:02:13.080> a<00:02:13.200> glide<00:02:13.530> effect

00:02:13.880 --> 00:02:13.890 
tends to have a more of a glide effect

00:02:13.890 --> 00:02:14.150 
tends to have a more of a glide effect
two

00:02:14.150 --> 00:02:14.160 
two

00:02:14.160 --> 00:02:16.610 
two
so<00:02:14.550> when<00:02:14.760> you<00:02:14.850> jump<00:02:15.180> you're<00:02:15.660> able<00:02:16.020> to<00:02:16.140> glide<00:02:16.380> a

00:02:16.610 --> 00:02:16.620 
so when you jump you're able to glide a

00:02:16.620 --> 00:02:17.990 
so when you jump you're able to glide a
little<00:02:16.980> bit<00:02:17.100> throughout<00:02:17.340> the<00:02:17.640> maps<00:02:17.850> it

00:02:17.990 --> 00:02:18.000 
little bit throughout the maps it

00:02:18.000 --> 00:02:20.180 
little bit throughout the maps it
doesn't<00:02:18.300> make<00:02:18.390> a<00:02:18.660> class<00:02:19.260> that's<00:02:19.470> fast<00:02:19.980> you

00:02:20.180 --> 00:02:20.190 
doesn't make a class that's fast you

00:02:20.190 --> 00:02:22.310 
doesn't make a class that's fast you
don't<00:02:20.370> like<00:02:20.580> transition<00:02:21.240> with<00:02:21.780> the<00:02:21.900> different

00:02:22.310 --> 00:02:22.320 
don't like transition with the different

00:02:22.320 --> 00:02:24.440 
don't like transition with the different
portions<00:02:22.740> while<00:02:23.160> jumping<00:02:23.460> it's<00:02:24.060> more<00:02:24.270> of<00:02:24.390> a

00:02:24.440 --> 00:02:24.450 
portions while jumping it's more of a

00:02:24.450 --> 00:02:25.730 
portions while jumping it's more of a
class<00:02:24.630> that<00:02:24.780> you<00:02:24.900> can<00:02:25.020> use<00:02:25.140> to<00:02:25.170> probably<00:02:25.530> reach

00:02:25.730 --> 00:02:25.740 
class that you can use to probably reach

00:02:25.740 --> 00:02:27.710 
class that you can use to probably reach
higher<00:02:26.040> places<00:02:26.400> or<00:02:26.700> kind<00:02:27.180> of<00:02:27.270> float<00:02:27.510> in<00:02:27.630> the

00:02:27.710 --> 00:02:27.720 
higher places or kind of float in the

00:02:27.720 --> 00:02:30.290 
higher places or kind of float in the
air<00:02:27.750> and<00:02:28.170> glad<00:02:28.590> your<00:02:29.070> way<00:02:29.250> from<00:02:29.760> one<00:02:30.000> place<00:02:30.270> to

00:02:30.290 --> 00:02:30.300 
air and glad your way from one place to

00:02:30.300 --> 00:02:32.090 
air and glad your way from one place to
another<00:02:30.540> so<00:02:31.260> it<00:02:31.350> does<00:02:31.560> leave<00:02:31.770> you<00:02:31.890> vulnerable

00:02:32.090 --> 00:02:32.100 
another so it does leave you vulnerable

00:02:32.100 --> 00:02:34.400 
another so it does leave you vulnerable
when<00:02:32.700> you're<00:02:32.880> actually<00:02:33.090> gliding<00:02:33.840> so<00:02:34.230> this

00:02:34.400 --> 00:02:34.410 
when you're actually gliding so this

00:02:34.410 --> 00:02:36.230 
when you're actually gliding so this
class<00:02:34.650> like<00:02:34.860> I<00:02:34.950> said<00:02:35.190> does<00:02:35.370> require<00:02:35.670> to<00:02:35.910> you<00:02:36.030> be

00:02:36.230 --> 00:02:36.240 
class like I said does require to you be

00:02:36.240 --> 00:02:37.670 
class like I said does require to you be
a<00:02:36.390> little<00:02:36.750> bit<00:02:36.960> more<00:02:37.110> experience<00:02:37.620> with

00:02:37.670 --> 00:02:37.680 
a little bit more experience with

00:02:37.680 --> 00:02:39.890 
a little bit more experience with
first-person<00:02:38.250> shooter<00:02:38.580> games<00:02:38.910> now<00:02:39.420> when<00:02:39.870> you

00:02:39.890 --> 00:02:39.900 
first-person shooter games now when you

00:02:39.900 --> 00:02:42.320 
first-person shooter games now when you
fully<00:02:40.290> upgrade<00:02:40.830> your<00:02:40.950> jump<00:02:41.400> ability<00:02:41.700> you're

00:02:42.320 --> 00:02:42.330 
fully upgrade your jump ability you're

00:02:42.330 --> 00:02:44.240 
fully upgrade your jump ability you're
able<00:02:42.690> to<00:02:42.750> teleport<00:02:42.990> and<00:02:43.440> teleport<00:02:44.010> could<00:02:44.130> be

00:02:44.240 --> 00:02:44.250 
able to teleport and teleport could be

00:02:44.250 --> 00:02:46.670 
able to teleport and teleport could be
useful<00:02:44.460> for<00:02:44.820> you<00:02:45.570> to<00:02:45.690> close<00:02:45.900> gaps<00:02:46.200> when<00:02:46.560> you

00:02:46.670 --> 00:02:46.680 
useful for you to close gaps when you

00:02:46.680 --> 00:02:48.260 
useful for you to close gaps when you
want<00:02:46.890> to<00:02:46.980> mainly<00:02:47.250> something<00:02:47.610> now<00:02:47.730> talk<00:02:48.240> about

00:02:48.260 --> 00:02:48.270 
want to mainly something now talk about

00:02:48.270 --> 00:02:50.660 
want to mainly something now talk about
melee<00:02:48.780> I<00:02:49.020> love<00:02:49.530> the<00:02:49.710> melee<00:02:50.070> of<00:02:50.280> the<00:02:50.400> world

00:02:50.660 --> 00:02:50.670 
melee I love the melee of the world

00:02:50.670 --> 00:02:52.460 
melee I love the melee of the world
class<00:02:50.970> because<00:02:51.660> it's<00:02:51.810> kind<00:02:51.960> of<00:02:51.990> like<00:02:52.080> that<00:02:52.290> you

00:02:52.460 --> 00:02:52.470 
class because it's kind of like that you

00:02:52.470 --> 00:02:53.990 
class because it's kind of like that you
know<00:02:52.500> like<00:02:52.710> a<00:02:52.740> soccer<00:02:53.160> punched<00:02:53.490> you<00:02:53.850> just

00:02:53.990 --> 00:02:54.000 
know like a soccer punched you just

00:02:54.000 --> 00:02:55.790 
know like a soccer punched you just
punch<00:02:54.270> him<00:02:54.420> and<00:02:54.570> it<00:02:54.930> does<00:02:55.170> this<00:02:55.320> force<00:02:55.710> field

00:02:55.790 --> 00:02:55.800 
punch him and it does this force field

00:02:55.800 --> 00:02:58.070 
punch him and it does this force field
it's<00:02:56.130> kind<00:02:56.340> of<00:02:56.370> just<00:02:56.520> blast<00:02:56.910> them<00:02:57.090> away<00:02:57.510> so

00:02:58.070 --> 00:02:58.080 
it's kind of just blast them away so

00:02:58.080 --> 00:03:00.170 
it's kind of just blast them away so
think<00:02:58.410> of<00:02:58.500> the<00:02:58.680> the<00:02:58.950> you<00:02:59.190> know<00:02:59.310> the<00:02:59.550> relay<00:03:00.150> is

00:03:00.170 --> 00:03:00.180 
think of the the you know the relay is

00:03:00.180 --> 00:03:01.940 
think of the the you know the relay is
something<00:03:00.690> that<00:03:00.780> you<00:03:00.870> just<00:03:00.990> hit<00:03:01.380> someone<00:03:01.770> with

00:03:01.940 --> 00:03:01.950 
something that you just hit someone with

00:03:01.950 --> 00:03:03.710 
something that you just hit someone with
their<00:03:02.370> mainly<00:03:02.700> in<00:03:02.790> cans<00:03:03.030> like<00:03:03.240> a<00:03:03.300> force<00:03:03.630> field

00:03:03.710 --> 00:03:03.720 
their mainly in cans like a force field

00:03:03.720 --> 00:03:05.480 
their mainly in cans like a force field
that<00:03:03.990> pushes<00:03:04.410> the<00:03:04.500> person<00:03:04.830> away<00:03:05.130> in<00:03:05.310> this

00:03:05.480 --> 00:03:05.490 
that pushes the person away in this

00:03:05.490 --> 00:03:07.880 
that pushes the person away in this
person's<00:03:05.910> then<00:03:06.030> it's<00:03:06.630> very<00:03:06.840> cool<00:03:07.140> type<00:03:07.710> of

00:03:07.880 --> 00:03:07.890 
person's then it's very cool type of

00:03:07.890 --> 00:03:09.440 
person's then it's very cool type of
class<00:03:08.100> because<00:03:08.460> it<00:03:08.610> involves<00:03:09.090> the<00:03:09.210> void

00:03:09.440 --> 00:03:09.450 
class because it involves the void

00:03:09.450 --> 00:03:12.140 
class because it involves the void
energy<00:03:09.900> so<00:03:10.350> it<00:03:10.380> delivers<00:03:10.830> a<00:03:10.860> lot<00:03:11.280> of<00:03:11.460> a<00:03:11.610> lot<00:03:11.970> of

00:03:12.140 --> 00:03:12.150 
energy so it delivers a lot of a lot of

00:03:12.150 --> 00:03:14.720 
energy so it delivers a lot of a lot of
massive<00:03:12.780> damage<00:03:13.020> when<00:03:13.410> you<00:03:13.560> use<00:03:13.770> the<00:03:14.070> tomato

00:03:14.720 --> 00:03:14.730 
massive damage when you use the tomato

00:03:14.730 --> 00:03:16.970 
massive damage when you use the tomato
so<00:03:15.090> the<00:03:15.600> cool<00:03:15.840> thing<00:03:15.870> about<00:03:16.170> the<00:03:16.470> mailing<00:03:16.800> to

00:03:16.970 --> 00:03:16.980 
so the cool thing about the mailing to

00:03:16.980 --> 00:03:19.010 
so the cool thing about the mailing to
is<00:03:17.190> it<00:03:17.370> once<00:03:17.640> you<00:03:17.760> upgraded<00:03:18.330> your<00:03:18.360> able<00:03:18.870> to

00:03:19.010 --> 00:03:19.020 
is it once you upgraded your able to

00:03:19.020 --> 00:03:22.940 
is it once you upgraded your able to
also<00:03:19.890> do<00:03:20.520> reduce<00:03:21.090> the<00:03:21.270> cooldown<00:03:21.480> time<00:03:22.080> on<00:03:22.380> your

00:03:22.940 --> 00:03:22.950 
also do reduce the cooldown time on your

and also on your mail it but once you

00:03:33.510 --> 00:03:35.270 
and also on your mail it but once you
upgrade<00:03:33.720> this<00:03:34.050> you're<00:03:34.260> able<00:03:34.560> to<00:03:34.650> increase<00:03:34.980> the

00:03:35.270 --> 00:03:35.280 
upgrade this you're able to increase the

00:03:35.280 --> 00:03:37.730 
upgrade this you're able to increase the
movement<00:03:35.640> speed<00:03:35.880> on<00:03:36.030> your<00:03:36.090> kills<00:03:36.959> and<00:03:37.230> also<00:03:37.620> it

00:03:37.730 --> 00:03:37.740 
movement speed on your kills and also it

00:03:37.740 --> 00:03:39.470 
movement speed on your kills and also it
restores<00:03:38.160> health<00:03:38.340> and<00:03:38.670> reduces<00:03:39.150> the<00:03:39.270> cool

00:03:39.470 --> 00:03:39.480 
restores health and reduces the cool

00:03:39.480 --> 00:03:40.790 
restores health and reduces the cool
time<00:03:39.660> of<00:03:39.870> your<00:03:40.020> super<00:03:40.320> so<00:03:40.440> it's<00:03:40.590> very

00:03:40.790 --> 00:03:40.800 
time of your super so it's very

00:03:40.800 --> 00:03:42.979 
time of your super so it's very
effective<00:03:41.160> when<00:03:42.030> you're<00:03:42.240> using<00:03:42.480> this<00:03:42.750> class

00:03:42.979 --> 00:03:42.989 
effective when you're using this class

00:03:42.989 --> 00:03:44.750 
effective when you're using this class
so<00:03:43.200> I<00:03:43.260> would<00:03:43.500> highly<00:03:43.800> suggest<00:03:43.830> the<00:03:44.310> view<00:03:44.459> but

00:03:44.750 --> 00:03:44.760 
so I would highly suggest the view but

00:03:44.760 --> 00:03:46.280 
so I would highly suggest the view but
if<00:03:45.120> you're<00:03:45.360> going<00:03:45.510> to<00:03:45.570> be<00:03:45.660> using<00:03:45.810> this<00:03:46.050> class

00:03:46.280 --> 00:03:46.290 
if you're going to be using this class

00:03:46.290 --> 00:03:47.840 
if you're going to be using this class
you're<00:03:46.830> definitely<00:03:47.070> going<00:03:47.370> to<00:03:47.430> want<00:03:47.489> to

00:03:47.840 --> 00:03:47.850 
you're definitely going to want to

00:03:47.850 --> 00:03:49.370 
you're definitely going to want to
increase<00:03:48.120> your<00:03:48.180> double<00:03:48.630> jump<00:03:48.810> as<00:03:48.959> soon<00:03:49.260> as

00:03:49.370 --> 00:03:49.380 
increase your double jump as soon as

00:03:49.380 --> 00:03:51.440 
increase your double jump as soon as
possible<00:03:49.890> so<00:03:50.310> you<00:03:50.340> can<00:03:50.489> get<00:03:50.970> that<00:03:51.000> ino

00:03:51.440 --> 00:03:51.450 
possible so you can get that ino

00:03:51.450 --> 00:03:54.290 
possible so you can get that ino
teleporting<00:03:52.140> feature<00:03:52.680> of<00:03:53.010> them<00:03:53.220> of<00:03:53.459> the<00:03:53.790> world

00:03:54.290 --> 00:03:54.300 
teleporting feature of them of the world

00:03:54.300 --> 00:03:56.120 
teleporting feature of them of the world
class<00:03:54.540> so<00:03:54.900> you<00:03:54.989> could<00:03:55.230> ease<00:03:55.380> your<00:03:55.410> melee<00:03:55.950> as

00:03:56.120 --> 00:03:56.130 
class so you could ease your melee as

00:03:56.130 --> 00:03:58.940 
class so you could ease your melee as
you<00:03:56.760> know<00:03:56.850> as<00:03:57.030> much<00:03:57.239> as<00:03:57.480> often<00:03:58.050> as<00:03:58.260> possible<00:03:58.500> so

00:03:58.940 --> 00:03:58.950 
you know as much as often as possible so

00:03:58.950 --> 00:04:01.699 
you know as much as often as possible so
you<00:03:58.980> can<00:03:59.070> definitely<00:03:59.459> in<00:03:59.850> not<00:04:00.540> only<00:04:00.570> reduce<00:04:01.530> to

00:04:01.699 --> 00:04:01.709 
you can definitely in not only reduce to

00:04:01.709 --> 00:04:02.930 
you can definitely in not only reduce to
cool<00:04:01.890> down<00:04:01.920> on<00:04:02.190> the<00:04:02.280> grenades<00:04:02.550> but<00:04:02.760> also

00:04:02.930 --> 00:04:02.940 
cool down on the grenades but also

00:04:02.940 --> 00:04:05.330 
cool down on the grenades but also
reduce<00:04:03.390> the<00:04:03.510> cooldown<00:04:03.690> of<00:04:04.110> your<00:04:04.440> super<00:04:04.860> now

00:04:05.330 --> 00:04:05.340 
reduce the cooldown of your super now

00:04:05.340 --> 00:04:07.160 
reduce the cooldown of your super now
talking<00:04:05.580> about<00:04:05.850> the<00:04:05.940> super<00:04:06.270> the<00:04:06.600> super<00:04:06.989> could

00:04:07.160 --> 00:04:07.170 
talking about the super the super could

00:04:07.170 --> 00:04:09.440 
talking about the super the super could
be<00:04:07.290> a<00:04:07.320> very<00:04:07.560> tricky<00:04:07.920> you<00:04:08.670> know<00:04:08.700> way<00:04:09.090> of<00:04:09.120> using

00:04:09.440 --> 00:04:09.450 
be a very tricky you know way of using

00:04:09.450 --> 00:04:11.330 
be a very tricky you know way of using
it<00:04:09.660> because<00:04:09.810> it<00:04:10.320> requires<00:04:10.950> a<00:04:11.040> lot<00:04:11.310> of

00:04:11.330 --> 00:04:11.340 
it because it requires a lot of

00:04:11.340 --> 00:04:13.550 
it because it requires a lot of
precision<00:04:11.970> and<00:04:12.090> it<00:04:12.510> requires<00:04:12.870> you<00:04:13.050> to<00:04:13.170> jump<00:04:13.410> in

00:04:13.550 --> 00:04:13.560 
precision and it requires you to jump in

00:04:13.560 --> 00:04:15.410 
precision and it requires you to jump in
the<00:04:13.650> air<00:04:13.770> and<00:04:13.980> throw<00:04:14.220> a<00:04:14.250> force<00:04:14.640> field<00:04:14.940> kind<00:04:15.390> of

00:04:15.410 --> 00:04:15.420 
the air and throw a force field kind of

00:04:15.420 --> 00:04:17.599 
the air and throw a force field kind of
like<00:04:15.540> a<00:04:15.570> purple<00:04:16.109> blast<00:04:16.410> force<00:04:17.100> field<00:04:17.370> on<00:04:17.549> to

00:04:17.599 --> 00:04:17.609 
like a purple blast force field on to

00:04:17.609 --> 00:04:20.240 
like a purple blast force field on to
you<00:04:18.480> know<00:04:18.630> the<00:04:18.840> enemy<00:04:19.169> or<00:04:19.560> the<00:04:19.650> person<00:04:20.130> you're

00:04:20.240 --> 00:04:20.250 
you know the enemy or the person you're

00:04:20.250 --> 00:04:21.979 
you know the enemy or the person you're
trying<00:04:20.400> to<00:04:20.520> hit<00:04:20.730> so<00:04:21.120> requires<00:04:21.540> you<00:04:21.720> to<00:04:21.840> be<00:04:21.959> very

00:04:21.979 --> 00:04:21.989 
trying to hit so requires you to be very

00:04:21.989 --> 00:04:23.590 
trying to hit so requires you to be very
precise<00:04:22.800> when

00:04:23.590 --> 00:04:23.600 
precise when

00:04:23.600 --> 00:04:25.000 
precise when
in<00:04:23.660> the<00:04:23.780> force<00:04:24.050> field<00:04:24.260> so<00:04:24.680> you're<00:04:24.830> definitely

00:04:25.000 --> 00:04:25.010 
in the force field so you're definitely

00:04:25.010 --> 00:04:26.500 
in the force field so you're definitely
going<00:04:25.280> to<00:04:25.340> want<00:04:25.400> to<00:04:25.580> be<00:04:25.670> precautious<00:04:26.000> point

00:04:26.500 --> 00:04:26.510 
going to want to be precautious point

00:04:26.510 --> 00:04:28.120 
going to want to be precautious point
aiming<00:04:26.870> this<00:04:27.020> down<00:04:27.290> you're<00:04:27.710> not<00:04:27.890> going<00:04:28.070> to

00:04:28.120 --> 00:04:28.130 
aiming this down you're not going to

00:04:28.130 --> 00:04:29.800 
aiming this down you're not going to
want<00:04:28.220> to<00:04:28.340> do<00:04:28.460> this<00:04:28.580> in<00:04:28.790> close<00:04:29.060> clora<00:04:29.360> combats

00:04:29.800 --> 00:04:29.810 
want to do this in close clora combats

00:04:29.810 --> 00:04:31.330 
want to do this in close clora combats
because<00:04:30.080> you<00:04:30.170> could<00:04:30.320> probably<00:04:30.710> miss<00:04:31.070> so<00:04:31.220> the

00:04:31.330 --> 00:04:31.340 
because you could probably miss so the

00:04:33.580 --> 00:04:33.590 
person could probably dodged the actual

00:04:33.590 --> 00:04:36.010

you<00:04:33.770> know<00:04:33.800> blast<00:04:34.250> or<00:04:34.580> radius<00:04:34.940> coming<00:04:35.270> down<00:04:35.420> but

00:04:36.010 --> 00:04:36.020 
you know blast or radius coming down but

00:04:36.020 --> 00:04:37.570 
you know blast or radius coming down but
it's<00:04:36.260> a<00:04:36.410> very<00:04:36.440> effective<00:04:37.310> and<00:04:37.490> very

00:04:37.570 --> 00:04:37.580 
it's a very effective and very

it's a very effective and very
productive<00:04:38.330> super<00:04:39.020> because<00:04:39.290> this<00:04:39.590> caused<00:04:39.830> a

00:04:39.850 --> 00:04:39.860 
productive super because this caused a

00:04:39.860 --> 00:04:42.370 
productive super because this caused a
lot<00:04:40.100> of<00:04:40.130> damage<00:04:40.370> one<00:04:40.940> use<00:04:41.120> well<00:04:41.600> but<00:04:42.140> like<00:04:42.260> I

00:04:52.420 --> 00:04:52.430 
recommend you get used to the super and

00:04:52.430 --> 00:04:54.640 
recommend you get used to the super and
the<00:04:52.610> radius<00:04:53.060> of<00:04:53.240> attack<00:04:53.600> of<00:04:53.840> the<00:04:54.050> actual<00:04:54.320> super

00:04:54.640 --> 00:04:54.650 
the radius of attack of the actual super

00:04:54.650 --> 00:04:56.440 
the radius of attack of the actual super
and<00:04:54.860> don't<00:04:55.160> use<00:04:55.370> it<00:04:55.520> in<00:04:55.670> close<00:04:55.940> quarter<00:04:56.420> combat

00:04:56.440 --> 00:04:56.450 
and don't use it in close quarter combat

00:04:56.450 --> 00:04:59.170 
and don't use it in close quarter combat
because<00:04:57.260> it's<00:04:57.590> easy<00:04:57.830> to<00:04:58.040> dodge<00:04:58.310> now<00:04:58.610> when<00:04:59.090> you

00:04:59.170 --> 00:04:59.180 
because it's easy to dodge now when you

00:04:59.180 --> 00:05:01.690 
because it's easy to dodge now when you
upgrade<00:04:59.420> this<00:04:59.780> it's<00:05:00.050> a<00:05:00.530> when<00:05:01.160> you<00:05:01.250> upgrade<00:05:01.400> the

00:05:01.690 --> 00:05:01.700 
upgrade this it's a when you upgrade the

00:05:01.700 --> 00:05:03.910 
upgrade this it's a when you upgrade the
super<00:05:02.120> the<00:05:02.570> super<00:05:02.930> splits<00:05:03.560> in<00:05:03.680> three

00:05:03.910 --> 00:05:03.920 
super the super splits in three

00:05:03.920 --> 00:05:05.890 
super the super splits in three
different<00:05:04.130> types<00:05:04.460> of<00:05:04.610> projectiles<00:05:04.790> and<00:05:05.330> they

00:05:05.890 --> 00:05:05.900 
different types of projectiles and they

00:05:05.900 --> 00:05:08.110 
different types of projectiles and they
travel<00:05:06.200> a<00:05:06.590> at<00:05:06.800> a<00:05:06.860> longer<00:05:07.430> high<00:05:07.640> speed<00:05:08.000> or

00:05:08.110 --> 00:05:08.120 
travel a at a longer high speed or

00:05:08.120 --> 00:05:10.390 
travel a at a longer high speed or
radius<00:05:08.510> and<00:05:08.750> it<00:05:08.960> also<00:05:09.200> does<00:05:09.560> persistent

00:05:10.390 --> 00:05:10.400 
radius and it also does persistent

00:05:10.400 --> 00:05:11.680 
radius and it also does persistent
damage<00:05:10.700> while<00:05:10.880> trapping<00:05:11.300> the<00:05:11.390> immense

00:05:11.680 --> 00:05:11.690 
damage while trapping the immense

00:05:11.690 --> 00:05:14.110 
damage while trapping the immense
enemies<00:05:12.410> within<00:05:12.620> the<00:05:12.860> force<00:05:13.160> field<00:05:13.400> so<00:05:13.910> think

00:05:14.110 --> 00:05:14.120 
enemies within the force field so think

00:05:14.120 --> 00:05:16.120 
enemies within the force field so think
of<00:05:14.210> the<00:05:14.330> super<00:05:14.720> once<00:05:15.260> it's<00:05:15.500> upgraded<00:05:15.770> it's

00:05:16.120 --> 00:05:16.130 
of the super once it's upgraded it's

00:05:16.130 --> 00:05:17.680 
of the super once it's upgraded it's
going<00:05:16.250> to<00:05:16.310> become<00:05:16.400> split<00:05:16.940> into<00:05:17.240> three<00:05:17.450> parts

00:05:17.680 --> 00:05:17.690 
going to become split into three parts

00:05:17.690 --> 00:05:19.150 
going to become split into three parts
and<00:05:17.990> you're<00:05:18.080> going<00:05:18.200> to<00:05:18.260> be<00:05:18.350> able<00:05:18.380> to<00:05:18.620> cost<00:05:18.800> more

00:05:19.150 --> 00:05:19.160 
and you're going to be able to cost more

00:05:19.160 --> 00:05:21.220 
and you're going to be able to cost more
heavily<00:05:19.460> damaged<00:05:19.940> not<00:05:20.390> only<00:05:20.720> to<00:05:20.870> your<00:05:21.050> enemies

00:05:21.220 --> 00:05:21.230 
heavily damaged not only to your enemies

00:05:21.230 --> 00:05:23.800 
heavily damaged not only to your enemies
but<00:05:21.830> you<00:05:21.950> can<00:05:22.070> also<00:05:22.310> be<00:05:22.670> able<00:05:22.760> to<00:05:22.970> trap<00:05:23.180> them<00:05:23.330> so

00:05:23.800 --> 00:05:23.810 
but you can also be able to trap them so

00:05:23.810 --> 00:05:25.660 
but you can also be able to trap them so
another<00:05:24.230> cool<00:05:24.500> thing<00:05:24.530> that<00:05:24.830> I<00:05:24.860> would<00:05:25.370> like<00:05:25.640> to

00:05:25.660 --> 00:05:25.670 
another cool thing that I would like to

00:05:25.670 --> 00:05:27.670 
another cool thing that I would like to
point<00:05:26.480> out<00:05:26.630> is<00:05:26.870> that<00:05:26.900> when<00:05:27.230> you<00:05:27.320> use<00:05:27.500> this

00:05:27.670 --> 00:05:27.680 
point out is that when you use this

00:05:27.680 --> 00:05:29.530 
point out is that when you use this
super<00:05:28.100> it<00:05:28.310> kind<00:05:28.730> of<00:05:28.760> reminds<00:05:29.090> me<00:05:29.210> of<00:05:29.300> the

00:05:29.530 --> 00:05:29.540 
super it kind of reminds me of the

00:05:29.540 --> 00:05:31.360 
super it kind of reminds me of the
grenade<00:05:29.870> the<00:05:30.110> way<00:05:30.200> the<00:05:30.350> grenade<00:05:30.650> works<00:05:30.950> in<00:05:31.130> the

00:05:31.360 --> 00:05:31.370 
grenade the way the grenade works in the

00:05:31.370 --> 00:05:33.190 
grenade the way the grenade works in the
grenade<00:05:31.700> the<00:05:31.910> way<00:05:32.060> the<00:05:32.180> grenade<00:05:32.480> traps<00:05:32.780> people

00:05:33.190 --> 00:05:33.200 
grenade the way the grenade traps people

00:05:33.200 --> 00:05:34.840 
grenade the way the grenade traps people
in<00:05:33.350> a<00:05:33.740> force<00:05:34.040> field<00:05:34.280> and<00:05:34.430> once<00:05:34.700> they're

00:05:34.840 --> 00:05:34.850 
in a force field and once they're

00:05:34.850 --> 00:05:37.120 
in a force field and once they're
trapped<00:05:35.150> in<00:05:35.300> a<00:05:35.390> forceful<00:05:35.720> it<00:05:36.020> kind<00:05:36.470> of<00:05:36.530> causes

00:05:37.120 --> 00:05:37.130 
trapped in a forceful it kind of causes

00:05:37.130 --> 00:05:39.070 
trapped in a forceful it kind of causes
some<00:05:37.310> heavy<00:05:37.550> damage<00:05:38.000> so<00:05:38.510> it's<00:05:38.660> definitely

00:05:39.070 --> 00:05:39.080 
some heavy damage so it's definitely

00:05:39.080 --> 00:05:40.450 
some heavy damage so it's definitely
similar<00:05:39.590> to<00:05:39.740> that<00:05:39.860> think<00:05:40.130> of<00:05:40.220> it<00:05:40.340> like

00:05:40.450 --> 00:05:40.460 
similar to that think of it like

00:05:40.460 --> 00:05:41.980 
similar to that think of it like
throwing<00:05:40.730> three<00:05:40.970> grenades<00:05:41.090> at<00:05:41.450> once<00:05:41.720> with

00:05:41.980 --> 00:05:41.990 
throwing three grenades at once with

00:05:41.990 --> 00:05:43.690 
throwing three grenades at once with
your<00:05:42.170> super<00:05:42.560> seen<00:05:43.010> it<00:05:43.130> kind<00:05:43.340> of<00:05:43.400> give<00:05:43.550> you<00:05:43.610> a

00:05:43.690 --> 00:05:43.700 
your super seen it kind of give you a

00:05:43.700 --> 00:05:45.040 
your super seen it kind of give you a
better<00:05:43.880> idea<00:05:44.000> if<00:05:44.390> you<00:05:44.510> haven't<00:05:44.810> played<00:05:44.960> the

00:05:45.040 --> 00:05:45.050 
better idea if you haven't played the

00:05:45.050 --> 00:05:47.320 
better idea if you haven't played the
game<00:05:45.080> or<00:05:45.380> what<00:05:45.920> the<00:05:46.040> super<00:05:46.460> upgraded<00:05:47.090> feels

00:05:47.320 --> 00:05:47.330 
game or what the super upgraded feels

00:05:47.330 --> 00:05:48.970 
game or what the super upgraded feels
like<00:05:47.570> or<00:05:47.780> what<00:05:47.930> it<00:05:48.080> works<00:05:48.260> like<00:05:48.470> it's

00:05:48.970 --> 00:05:48.980 
like or what it works like it's

00:05:48.980 --> 00:05:50.800 
like or what it works like it's
definitely<00:05:49.430> that's<00:05:49.580> what<00:05:49.880> it<00:05:50.060> works<00:05:50.330> like<00:05:50.540> now

00:05:50.800 --> 00:05:50.810 
definitely that's what it works like now

00:05:50.810 --> 00:05:52.390 
definitely that's what it works like now
the<00:05:51.260> grenades<00:05:51.590> as<00:05:51.770> you<00:05:51.860> guys<00:05:52.010> know<00:05:52.040> and

the grenades as you guys know and

00:05:52.400 --> 00:05:54.160 
the grenades as you guys know and
destiny<00:05:52.700> you<00:05:52.910> could<00:05:53.060> also<00:05:53.300> upgrade<00:05:53.870> them<00:05:53.990> and

00:05:54.160 --> 00:05:54.170 
destiny you could also upgrade them and

00:05:54.170 --> 00:05:57.130 
destiny you could also upgrade them and
will<00:05:55.070> produce<00:05:55.250> a<00:05:55.610> child<00:05:55.670> grenade<00:05:56.510> to<00:05:56.960> lay<00:05:57.110> down

00:05:57.130 --> 00:05:57.140 
will produce a child grenade to lay down

00:05:57.140 --> 00:05:58.750 
will produce a child grenade to lay down
like<00:05:57.530> carpet<00:05:57.980> of<00:05:58.100> damage<00:05:58.460> so<00:05:58.610> you're
