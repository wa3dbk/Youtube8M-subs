00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.540
 is to spend so many things last night we prayed 

00:00:02.100 --> 00:00:05.130
 talking about what happened inside the 

00:00:03.540 --> 00:00:06.629
 auditorium I 'm going to tell you that the 

00:00:05.130 --> 00:00:08.809
 most impressive things and happened right in 

00:00:06.629 --> 00:00:10.530
 front of me was when I was the 

00:00:08.809 --> 00:00:12.630
 opening show that was 

00:00:10.530 --> 00:00:14.670
 singing anthony marc with people of zone 

00:00:12.630 --> 00:00:17.670
 who parades to enter to look for his 

00:00:14.670 --> 00:00:19.080
 yale seats or with people houses but 

00:00:17.670 --> 00:00:21.510
 there was a small detail their seats 

00:00:19.080 --> 00:00:25.350
 they were busy then had to 

00:00:21.510 --> 00:00:27.000
 plains of lime so good I do not know how 

00:00:25.350 --> 00:00:29.400
 I do not know how he went through this I always 

00:00:27.000 --> 00:00:31.830
 these things happen historically or 

00:00:29.400 --> 00:00:33.840
 really yes but good she 

00:00:31.830 --> 00:00:35.190
 obviously she liked nothing and that she 

00:00:33.840 --> 00:00:36.660
 it came from bad points of mouth I was 

00:00:35.190 --> 00:00:38.760
 nervous about what she had to do and 

00:00:36.660 --> 00:00:40.350
 it was great by the way you can 

00:00:38.760 --> 00:00:42.059
 there but julius caesar marini I saw her 

00:00:40.350 --> 00:00:44.340
 to leave and it caught my attention that 

00:00:42.059 --> 00:00:46.469
 It came out very fast down the hall where I 

00:00:44.340 --> 00:00:48.210
 I was working and it was very, very 

00:00:46.469 --> 00:00:51.469
 nice to see because his bodyguards 

00:00:48.210 --> 00:00:51.469
 I went straight ahead and suddenly I saw how 

00:00:54.110 --> 00:00:58.829
 nice that a woman of my size does not 

00:00:56.640 --> 00:00:59.780
 with a very big man suddenly 

00:00:58.829 --> 00:01:04.180
 dance 

00:00:59.780 --> 00:01:06.740
 you have tasks 

00:01:04.180 --> 00:01:08.900
 because he lives in doubt apart from everything 

00:01:06.740 --> 00:01:11.090
 she was the one who ate the night with her 

00:01:08.900 --> 00:01:12.710
 tribute really definitely goes to 

00:01:11.090 --> 00:01:15.140
 go inside the scene things happened 

00:01:12.710 --> 00:01:16.220
 wonderful the duets and trios that 

00:01:15.140 --> 00:01:17.930
 they saw on stage they were 

00:01:16.220 --> 00:01:20.390
 really historic by denying well the 

00:01:17.930 --> 00:01:22.790
 lucero daddy yankee candle and carlos 

00:01:20.390 --> 00:01:24.500
 you live well it was fantastic but I can 

00:01:22.790 --> 00:01:26.240
 also get the reaction precisely 

00:01:24.500 --> 00:01:28.520
 by Marc Anthony about this great 

00:01:26.240 --> 00:01:31.030
 tribute that made the bronx's life the 

00:01:28.520 --> 00:01:31.030
 Water 

00:01:33.580 --> 00:01:40.570

00:01:46.500 --> 00:01:51.420
 made by jennifer lópez a selena 

00:01:48.930 --> 00:01:55.280
 next to the quintalilla family was the 

00:01:51.420 --> 00:01:55.280
 peak moment of the night 

00:01:57.430 --> 00:02:04.790
 and start singing 

00:02:00.390 --> 00:02:04.790
 He sang to me like that 

00:02:05.890 --> 00:02:09.750
 and it kills me 

00:02:09.780 --> 00:02:12.780
 divinity 

00:02:13.780 --> 00:02:19.690
 I feel very proud that they did 

00:02:16.569 --> 00:02:23.100

00:02:19.690 --> 00:02:29.460
