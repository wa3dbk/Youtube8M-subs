00:00:00.290 --> 00:00:05.069
 hi everybody today small 

00:00:02.340 --> 00:00:06.990
 donkey boxing a helmet I ordered on 

00:00:05.069 --> 00:00:09.690
 internet and I have not seen videos in 

00:00:06.990 --> 00:00:11.940
 French in any case on youtube so 

00:00:09.690 --> 00:00:13.920
 for this I redeem any 

00:00:11.940 --> 00:00:16.400
 to make this mexican man a shop 

00:00:13.920 --> 00:00:19.199
 so this is the headset xtor ms 1000 

00:00:16.400 --> 00:00:23.400
 so that's the helmet when the helmet to 

00:00:19.199 --> 00:00:24.630
 himself in his box a first trick 

00:00:23.400 --> 00:00:27.240
 that strikes me already is that I had it 

00:00:24.630 --> 00:00:29.609
 ordered in red on the site it was 

00:00:27.240 --> 00:00:31.910
 in red or glass but not good 

00:00:29.609 --> 00:00:31.910
 Arabic 

00:00:33.130 --> 00:00:38.830
 I still raise it there is everything that 

00:00:34.690 --> 00:00:45.550
 then comes the little note that here 

00:00:38.830 --> 00:00:50.050
 wait for the small notice the cable for 

00:00:45.550 --> 00:00:52.150
 Sidi baptized ps3 ps3 xbox ago 

00:00:50.050 --> 00:00:55.260
 okay I see the ace cable board is 

00:00:52.150 --> 00:01:00.670
 there the cables versa that goes the TV 

00:00:55.260 --> 00:01:03.000
 then that's the jack cable that 

00:01:00.670 --> 00:01:06.100
 part of the helmet that will go 

00:01:03.000 --> 00:01:08.500
 in the control in the remote from 

00:01:06.100 --> 00:01:08.979
 control if I understood correctly it's on 

00:01:08.500 --> 00:01:11.910
 Internet 

00:01:08.979 --> 00:01:11.910
 yeah that so 

00:01:20.130 --> 00:01:25.860
 the hookups for those who do not know 

00:01:21.689 --> 00:01:28.049
 not so here is the helmet it looks small 

00:01:25.860 --> 00:01:29.340
 so it's true he's not huge me 

00:01:28.049 --> 00:01:30.439
 for example I put them to the max for my 

00:01:29.340 --> 00:01:33.060
 head 

00:01:30.439 --> 00:01:34.649
 here I am going to come on the specific case 

00:01:33.060 --> 00:01:36.750
 because I just put like this and 

00:01:34.649 --> 00:01:39.659
 you will miss my feelings 

00:01:36.750 --> 00:01:40.860
 so what I said there I do not know if 

00:01:39.659 --> 00:01:44.909
 you see very well but it's a 

00:01:40.860 --> 00:01:46.770
 normal jack so here he comes out 

00:01:44.909 --> 00:01:50.189
 from there so if you want to put it on 

00:01:46.770 --> 00:01:53.759
 console but on your phones or any 

00:01:50.189 --> 00:01:55.439
 other type mp4 player or whatever and that's it 

00:01:53.759 --> 00:01:58.439
 and to plug on the plate so he 

00:01:55.439 --> 00:02:04.259
 you have to connect this to the cable 

00:01:58.439 --> 00:02:05.789
 so so how are you here? 

00:02:04.259 --> 00:02:08.429
 do you have the jack or put 

00:02:05.789 --> 00:02:11.670
 in and that's the exit so 

00:02:08.429 --> 00:02:14.579
 especially for ps3 you put the usb on 

00:02:11.670 --> 00:02:17.340
 the console here is usb on the console and 

00:02:14.579 --> 00:02:20.160
 the jack that you connect to this 

00:02:17.340 --> 00:02:22.860
 cable is there so I'm going to remove the 

00:02:20.160 --> 00:02:24.660
 little dishes ticket i will show you 

00:02:22.860 --> 00:02:27.600
 So pass the cable connections 

00:02:24.660 --> 00:02:29.640
 xbox 360 that goes to the controller I think 

00:02:27.600 --> 00:02:33.540
 so it does not interest me I'm going 

00:02:29.640 --> 00:02:36.030
 do me for the ps3 so you have the 

00:02:33.540 --> 00:02:38.040
 cable that leaves the headset that you put 

00:02:36.030 --> 00:02:41.489
 in the in order so you're 

00:02:38.040 --> 00:02:47.430
 just a little cache remove the 

00:02:41.489 --> 00:02:50.450
 cable to m in the in order to a 

00:02:47.430 --> 00:02:50.450
 hand not so easy 

00:02:54.330 --> 00:03:02.379
 here we are going to say that it's me and so 

00:02:59.799 --> 00:03:04.390
 you have the usb output that you put 

00:03:02.379 --> 00:03:06.970
 directly on the place of your 

00:03:04.390 --> 00:03:08.739
 console playstation 3 is what it is 

00:03:06.970 --> 00:03:19.450
 there you disconnect me on the cable 

00:03:08.739 --> 00:03:20.920
 RCA will behind the TV that's it 

00:03:19.450 --> 00:03:23.230
 it's connected and you put in 

00:03:20.920 --> 00:03:25.180
 derivation on the TV you put 

00:03:23.230 --> 00:03:26.890
 linger over the 4 of TV in addition 

00:03:25.180 --> 00:03:28.150
 the age of the enemies if you stay 

00:03:26.890 --> 00:03:29.980
 want to stay in high definition 

00:03:28.150 --> 00:03:33.190
 so this is our cable after that is 

00:03:29.980 --> 00:03:36.819
 ready for the console with the sound and the 

00:03:33.190 --> 00:03:38.260
 here is voice over on the playstation 3 so 

00:03:36.819 --> 00:03:39.640
 here is now I find you I 

00:03:38.260 --> 00:03:43.349
 I'm going to unplug all this and I'll 

00:03:39.640 --> 00:03:43.349
 found for the study of the helmet 

00:03:45.820 --> 00:03:49.850
 so here we are more particularly 

00:03:49.010 --> 00:03:53.270
 on the helmet 

00:03:49.850 --> 00:03:55.640
 so there are some pretty simple friends with 

00:03:53.270 --> 00:03:57.920
 their marks and if the small logo at 

00:03:55.640 --> 00:04:00.770
 on here and also in the 

00:03:57.920 --> 00:04:02.540
 pads the description was good 

00:04:00.770 --> 00:04:03.580
 on gold than on their site on their 

00:04:02.540 --> 00:04:05.540
 helmet 

00:04:03.580 --> 00:04:06.760
 the pads are really ultra 

00:04:05.540 --> 00:04:09.110
 soft 

00:04:06.760 --> 00:04:13.430
 good of course considering the price it's not worth a 

00:04:09.110 --> 00:04:16.670
 headphones from another price range but 

00:04:13.430 --> 00:04:18.920
 really comfortable with the instructions 

00:04:16.670 --> 00:04:21.290
 are really good the flexible microphone 

00:04:18.920 --> 00:04:23.630
 here I do not want to go in all 

00:04:21.290 --> 00:04:26.920
 meaning since that is but it is flexible 

00:04:23.630 --> 00:04:26.920
 and adjustable too 

00:04:26.940 --> 00:04:32.370
 what else can we say there we see two 

00:04:28.800 --> 00:04:32.940
 lentils brive the cable also with the 

00:04:32.370 --> 00:04:36.110
 playstation 

00:04:32.940 --> 00:04:39.230
 finally the course is quite long 

00:04:36.110 --> 00:04:46.470
 the remote so naked microphone and 

00:04:39.230 --> 00:04:52.380
 these are the volumes of the cat and du 

00:04:46.470 --> 00:04:53.880
 game and so I said that despite the price 

00:04:52.380 --> 00:04:55.740
 I wanted a case what I got 

00:04:53.880 --> 00:04:58.080
 a lot of breaks but I wanted a 

00:04:55.740 --> 00:04:59.250
 finally just for for the base that 

00:04:58.080 --> 00:05:03.360
 the story of talking about being able to hear 

00:04:59.250 --> 00:05:04.560
 good game so I got scared 

00:05:03.360 --> 00:05:06.780
 because there was no us 

00:05:04.560 --> 00:05:08.610
 bound to nothing is plastic but enough 

00:05:06.780 --> 00:05:11.130
 of com but it's plastic and not 

00:05:08.610 --> 00:05:14.880
 we were afraid of comfort 

00:05:11.130 --> 00:05:16.890
 but there I put it a little bit and and 

00:05:14.880 --> 00:05:20.490
 how and in fact we do not feel 

00:05:16.890 --> 00:05:22.080
 all plastic due to its shape and it is 

00:05:20.490 --> 00:05:25.440
 really comfortable for its price is 

00:05:22.080 --> 00:05:27.900
 so here it's really good corner here 

00:05:25.440 --> 00:05:31.950
 so the points I remember is that 

00:05:27.900 --> 00:05:34.200
 it is comfortable that there is cable and 

00:05:31.950 --> 00:05:37.620
 it just seems what 

00:05:34.200 --> 00:05:40.230
 simply time it is simple and 

00:05:37.620 --> 00:05:40.790
 him the design and the specials but he 

00:05:40.230 --> 00:05:42.990
 is not bad 

00:05:40.790 --> 00:05:44.520
 here we can see what it's worth 

00:05:42.990 --> 00:05:47.640
 other day I will put you in the east what 

00:05:44.520 --> 00:05:49.500
 are the points the positive and 

00:05:47.640 --> 00:05:52.080
 the negative points on the points 

00:05:49.500 --> 00:05:53.490
 negatives did not go much further than 

00:05:52.080 --> 00:05:55.680
 but that's not about the brand is 

00:05:53.490 --> 00:05:57.810
 on cdiscount who they confused 

00:05:55.680 --> 00:05:59.490
 they have not put the right address especially 

00:05:57.810 --> 00:06:00.870
 I ordered it in red and I 

00:05:59.490 --> 00:06:04.200
 did not even know that wheat existed because 

00:06:00.870 --> 00:06:06.270
 it was red or green here we are his 

00:06:04.200 --> 00:06:11.730
 price of 46 euros if I say no 

00:06:06.270 --> 00:06:12.590
 nonsense compatible ps3 ps4 xbox 360 and 

00:06:11.730 --> 00:06:15.419

00:06:15.419 --> 00:06:20.940
