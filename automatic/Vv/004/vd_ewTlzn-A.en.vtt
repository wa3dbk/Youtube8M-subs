00:00:38.240 --> 00:00:38.250 
wheels really fills the wheel while out

00:00:38.250 --> 00:00:39.440 
wheels really fills the wheel while out
and<00:00:38.430> make<00:00:38.520> the<00:00:38.640> truck<00:00:38.879> it<00:00:39.030> makes<00:00:39.180> the<00:00:39.270> truck

00:00:39.440 --> 00:00:39.450 
and make the truck it makes the truck

00:00:39.450 --> 00:00:41.479 
and make the truck it makes the truck
look<00:00:39.690> really<00:00:39.930> nice<00:00:40.050> I<00:00:40.379> can<00:00:41.100> imagine<00:00:41.250> the

00:00:41.479 --> 00:00:41.489 
look really nice I can imagine the

00:00:41.489 --> 00:00:42.830 
look really nice I can imagine the
payoff<00:00:41.760> when<00:00:41.910> you<00:00:42.000> drive<00:00:42.239> it<00:00:42.390> is<00:00:42.480> going<00:00:42.690> to<00:00:42.750> be

00:00:42.830 --> 00:00:42.840 
payoff when you drive it is going to be

00:00:42.840 --> 00:00:44.270 
payoff when you drive it is going to be
it's<00:00:42.960> gonna<00:00:43.050> be<00:00:43.170> more<00:00:43.379> responsive<00:00:43.950> than<00:00:43.980> say

00:00:44.270 --> 00:00:44.280 
it's gonna be more responsive than say

00:00:44.280 --> 00:00:47.650 
it's gonna be more responsive than say
the<00:00:44.520> last<00:00:45.180> model<00:00:45.600> this<00:00:46.530> truck<00:00:46.739> is<00:00:46.860> still<00:00:47.070> a

00:00:47.650 --> 00:00:47.660 
the last model this truck is still a

00:00:47.660 --> 00:00:50.029 
the last model this truck is still a
body-on-frame<00:00:48.660> so<00:00:49.379> it's<00:00:49.559> not<00:00:49.710> like<00:00:49.920> the

00:00:50.029 --> 00:00:50.039 
body-on-frame so it's not like the

00:00:50.039 --> 00:00:51.049 
body-on-frame so it's not like the
Highlander<00:00:50.370> in<00:00:50.550> the<00:00:50.640> sense<00:00:50.820> of<00:00:50.940> the

00:00:51.049 --> 00:00:51.059 
Highlander in the sense of the

00:00:51.059 --> 00:00:53.600 
Highlander in the sense of the
Highlanders<00:00:51.449> a<00:00:51.480> unibody<00:00:51.960> or<00:00:52.320> a<00:00:52.649> car<00:00:53.010> base<00:00:53.190> SUV

00:00:53.600 --> 00:00:53.610 
Highlanders a unibody or a car base SUV

00:00:53.610 --> 00:00:57.410 
Highlanders a unibody or a car base SUV
this<00:00:53.730> is<00:00:53.879> still<00:00:54.030> a<00:00:54.059> truck<00:00:54.390> based<00:00:54.809> SUV<00:00:56.059> and<00:00:57.059> it's

00:00:57.410 --> 00:00:57.420 
this is still a truck based SUV and it's

00:00:57.420 --> 00:00:59.450 
this is still a truck based SUV and it's
gonna<00:00:57.539> be<00:00:57.719> very<00:00:57.930> off-road<00:00:58.350> capable<00:00:58.829> if<00:00:59.370> you

00:00:59.450 --> 00:00:59.460 
gonna be very off-road capable if you

00:00:59.460 --> 00:01:01.010 
gonna be very off-road capable if you
look<00:00:59.640> at<00:00:59.760> the<00:00:59.850> front<00:01:00.149> you<00:01:00.510> can<00:01:00.660> see<00:01:00.809> it's<00:01:00.960> gonna

00:01:01.010 --> 00:01:01.020 
look at the front you can see it's gonna

00:01:01.020 --> 00:01:03.260 
look at the front you can see it's gonna
have<00:01:01.230> a<00:01:01.260> decent<00:01:01.710> approach<00:01:02.190> angle<00:01:02.670> and

00:01:03.260 --> 00:01:03.270 
have a decent approach angle and

00:01:03.270 --> 00:01:04.250 
have a decent approach angle and
obviously<00:01:03.539> the<00:01:03.660> same<00:01:03.809> will<00:01:03.899> be<00:01:03.930> true<00:01:03.989> in<00:01:04.170> the

00:01:04.250 --> 00:01:04.260 
obviously the same will be true in the

00:01:04.260 --> 00:01:05.870 
obviously the same will be true in the
back<00:01:04.439> a<00:01:04.470> good<00:01:04.710> departure<00:01:05.220> angle<00:01:05.519> which<00:01:05.640> means

00:01:05.870 --> 00:01:05.880 
back a good departure angle which means

00:01:05.880 --> 00:01:08.320 
back a good departure angle which means
you<00:01:06.450> can<00:01:06.630> climb<00:01:07.080> up<00:01:07.229> to<00:01:07.470> steep<00:01:07.740> up<00:01:07.890> hills

00:01:08.320 --> 00:01:08.330 
you can climb up to steep up hills

00:01:08.330 --> 00:01:10.190 
you can climb up to steep up hills
places<00:01:09.330> that<00:01:09.420> you<00:01:09.570> really<00:01:09.810> shouldn't<00:01:10.080> take

00:01:10.190 --> 00:01:10.200 
places that you really shouldn't take

00:01:10.200 --> 00:01:11.630 
places that you really shouldn't take

00:01:14.450 --> 00:01:14.460

00:01:35.060 --> 00:01:35.070 
rear window now last year you could do

00:01:35.070 --> 00:01:36.469 
rear window now last year you could do
this<00:01:35.189> from<00:01:35.310> the<00:01:35.460> key<00:01:35.610> fob<00:01:35.790> you<00:01:35.850> can<00:01:36.180> push<00:01:36.360> the

00:01:36.469 --> 00:01:36.479 
this from the key fob you can push the

00:01:36.479 --> 00:01:38.390 
this from the key fob you can push the
button<00:01:36.630> that'll<00:01:36.960> lower<00:01:37.140> the<00:01:37.290> rear<00:01:37.470> window<00:01:37.770> and

that's<00:01:38.909> cool<00:01:39.119> but<00:01:39.960> I<00:01:40.200> think<00:01:40.320> having<00:01:40.710> the

00:01:40.910 --> 00:01:40.920 
that's cool but I think having the

00:01:40.920 --> 00:01:43.190 
that's cool but I think having the
ability<00:01:41.070> to<00:01:41.430> walk<00:01:42.180> up<00:01:42.420> and<00:01:42.600> touch<00:01:42.750> the<00:01:42.930> button

00:01:43.190 --> 00:01:43.200 
ability to walk up and touch the button

00:01:43.200 --> 00:01:44.899 
ability to walk up and touch the button
to<00:01:43.350> raise<00:01:43.590> the<00:01:43.829> window<00:01:44.159> or<00:01:44.399> lower<00:01:44.579> than<00:01:44.700> won<00:01:44.820> it

00:01:44.899 --> 00:01:44.909 
to raise the window or lower than won it

00:01:44.909 --> 00:01:47.330 
to raise the window or lower than won it
from<00:01:44.970> the<00:01:45.119> back<00:01:45.270> is<00:01:45.420> a<00:01:45.450> lot<00:01:45.630> better<00:01:46.009> I<00:01:47.009> think<00:01:47.280> if

00:01:47.330 --> 00:01:47.340 
from the back is a lot better I think if

00:01:47.340 --> 00:01:48.620 
from the back is a lot better I think if
