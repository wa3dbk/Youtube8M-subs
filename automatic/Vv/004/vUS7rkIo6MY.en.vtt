00:00:08.280 --> 00:00:08.290 
okay so here's a not for joining a

00:00:08.290 --> 00:00:13.080 
okay so here's a not for joining a
braided<00:00:08.530> mainly<00:00:09.160> to<00:00:10.090> a<00:00:10.480> shot<00:00:10.960> leader<00:00:12.090> they

00:00:13.080 --> 00:00:13.090 
braided mainly to a shot leader they

00:00:13.090 --> 00:00:14.340 
braided mainly to a shot leader they
said<00:00:13.300> actually<00:00:13.450> I'm<00:00:13.720> not<00:00:13.840> that<00:00:14.020> I<00:00:14.080> invented

myself
even<00:00:15.519> the<00:00:15.610> Channel<00:00:15.940> Islands<00:00:16.240> about<00:00:16.420> ten<00:00:16.689> years

00:00:16.859 --> 00:00:16.869 
even the Channel Islands about ten years

00:00:16.869 --> 00:00:19.260 
even the Channel Islands about ten years
ago<00:00:16.960> maybe<00:00:17.410> a<00:00:17.500> little<00:00:17.590> bit<00:00:17.740> longer<00:00:18.270> it's

00:00:19.260 --> 00:00:19.270 
ago maybe a little bit longer it's

00:00:19.270 --> 00:00:21.060 
ago maybe a little bit longer it's
pretty<00:00:19.540> simple<00:00:19.840> to<00:00:19.900> tie<00:00:20.140> and<00:00:20.439> it<00:00:20.619> has<00:00:20.770> never

00:00:21.060 --> 00:00:21.070 
pretty simple to tie and it has never

00:00:21.070 --> 00:00:22.950 
pretty simple to tie and it has never
let<00:00:21.340> me<00:00:21.369> down<00:00:21.610> inside<00:00:22.240> ten<00:00:22.480> or<00:00:22.599> twelve<00:00:22.840> years

00:00:22.950 --> 00:00:22.960 
let me down inside ten or twelve years

00:00:22.960 --> 00:00:25.319 
let me down inside ten or twelve years
so<00:00:23.560> if<00:00:24.160> you<00:00:24.279> can<00:00:24.430> learn<00:00:24.579> this<00:00:24.730> one<00:00:24.939> it's<00:00:25.119> a<00:00:25.180> real

00:00:25.319 --> 00:00:25.329 
so if you can learn this one it's a real

00:00:25.329 --> 00:00:26.100 
so if you can learn this one it's a real
good<00:00:25.450> one<00:00:25.509> tonight

00:00:26.100 --> 00:00:26.110 
good one tonight

00:00:26.110 --> 00:00:29.999 
good one tonight
st.<00:00:26.739> your<00:00:26.829> shop<00:00:26.980> leader<00:00:27.930> and<00:00:28.930> then<00:00:29.079> film<00:00:29.919> an

00:00:29.999 --> 00:00:30.009 
st. your shop leader and then film an

00:00:30.009 --> 00:00:32.069 
st. your shop leader and then film an
overhand<00:00:30.340> loop<00:00:30.550> like<00:00:31.000> that<00:00:31.180> but<00:00:31.689> then<00:00:31.810> put<00:00:31.989> the

00:00:32.069 --> 00:00:32.079 
overhand loop like that but then put the

00:00:32.079 --> 00:00:33.930 
overhand loop like that but then put the
tag<00:00:32.290> in<00:00:32.320> through<00:00:32.800> again<00:00:33.399> so<00:00:33.640> you've<00:00:33.760> gone

00:00:33.930 --> 00:00:33.940 
tag in through again so you've gone

00:00:33.940 --> 00:00:39.500 
tag in through again so you've gone
through<00:00:34.090> twice<00:00:34.510> okay<00:00:37.289> then<00:00:38.289> what<00:00:38.500> you<00:00:38.559> do<00:00:38.739> is

00:00:39.500 --> 00:00:39.510 
through twice okay then what you do is

00:00:39.510 --> 00:00:43.049 
through twice okay then what you do is
get<00:00:40.510> the<00:00:40.629> bottom<00:00:40.870> of<00:00:40.930> the<00:00:41.050> loop<00:00:41.760> bring<00:00:42.760> that<00:00:42.879> up

00:00:43.049 --> 00:00:43.059 
get the bottom of the loop bring that up

00:00:43.059 --> 00:00:47.630 
get the bottom of the loop bring that up
to<00:00:43.449> form<00:00:43.690> a<00:00:44.820> figure<00:00:45.820> about<00:00:46.000> you<00:00:46.210> sorry<00:00:47.079> now

00:00:47.630 --> 00:00:47.640 
to form a figure about you sorry now

00:00:47.640 --> 00:00:49.709 
to form a figure about you sorry now
this<00:00:48.640> is<00:00:48.760> a<00:00:48.850> tricky<00:00:49.120> bit<00:00:49.300> you've<00:00:49.420> got<00:00:49.539> across

00:00:49.709 --> 00:00:49.719 
this is a tricky bit you've got across

00:00:49.719 --> 00:00:52.619 
this is a tricky bit you've got across
the<00:00:49.839> end<00:00:50.170> of<00:00:50.260> your<00:00:50.350> braid<00:00:50.940> through<00:00:51.940> the<00:00:52.390> first

00:00:52.619 --> 00:00:52.629 
the end of your braid through the first

00:00:52.629 --> 00:00:55.410 
the end of your braid through the first
loop<00:00:53.309> the<00:00:54.309> same<00:00:54.519> direction<00:00:54.850> is<00:00:55.120> the<00:00:55.210> tech

00:00:55.410 --> 00:00:55.420 
loop the same direction is the tech

00:00:55.420 --> 00:00:56.939 
loop the same direction is the tech
Indies<00:00:55.809> coming<00:00:56.140> out<00:00:56.260> otherwise<00:00:56.530> it<00:00:56.769> won't

00:00:56.939 --> 00:00:56.949 
Indies coming out otherwise it won't

00:00:56.949 --> 00:01:00.060 
Indies coming out otherwise it won't
work<00:00:57.010> so<00:00:57.550> you<00:00:57.969> go<00:00:58.149> in<00:00:58.329> through<00:00:58.839> that<00:00:59.019> way<00:00:59.170> and

00:01:00.060 --> 00:01:00.070 
work so you go in through that way and

00:01:00.070 --> 00:01:03.170 
work so you go in through that way and
by<00:01:00.190> doing<00:01:00.429> that<00:01:00.749> when<00:01:01.749> you<00:01:01.839> put<00:01:02.019> it<00:01:02.140> through

00:01:03.170 --> 00:01:03.180 
by doing that when you put it through

00:01:03.180 --> 00:01:06.180 
by doing that when you put it through
the<00:01:04.180> second<00:01:04.809> loop<00:01:04.930> it<00:01:05.560> sure<00:01:05.710> that's<00:01:05.920> it

00:01:06.180 --> 00:01:06.190 
the second loop it sure that's it

00:01:06.190 --> 00:01:08.460 
the second loop it sure that's it
exactly<00:01:06.970> the<00:01:07.060> same<00:01:07.180> way<00:01:07.240> just<00:01:08.080> the<00:01:08.200> leaders

00:01:08.460 --> 00:01:08.470 
exactly the same way just the leaders

00:01:08.470 --> 00:01:10.740 
exactly the same way just the leaders
coming<00:01:08.740> out<00:01:08.950> as<00:01:09.250> well<00:01:09.360> okay<00:01:10.360> so<00:01:10.390> that's<00:01:10.630> the

00:01:10.740 --> 00:01:10.750 
coming out as well okay so that's the

00:01:10.750 --> 00:01:11.910 
coming out as well okay so that's the
main<00:01:10.930> bit<00:01:11.170> of<00:01:11.260> the<00:01:11.350> not<00:01:11.530> really

00:01:11.910 --> 00:01:11.920 
main bit of the not really

00:01:11.920 --> 00:01:19.550 
main bit of the not really
and<00:01:12.430> then<00:01:12.550> you<00:01:12.700> just<00:01:12.880> tighten<00:01:13.150> that<00:01:13.360> up

00:01:19.550 --> 00:01:19.560 

00:01:19.560 --> 00:01:22.789 

okay<00:01:20.310> so<00:01:21.299> now<00:01:21.450> what<00:01:21.600> you<00:01:21.690> do<00:01:21.810> I<00:01:22.020> like<00:01:22.500> to<00:01:22.590> turn

00:01:22.789 --> 00:01:22.799 
okay so now what you do I like to turn

00:01:22.799 --> 00:01:23.810 
okay so now what you do I like to turn
it<00:01:22.890> right<00:01:22.920> click<00:01:23.159> this<00:01:23.250> point<00:01:23.549> fizz<00:01:23.700> on

00:01:23.810 --> 00:01:23.820 
it right click this point fizz on

00:01:23.820 --> 00:01:26.539 
it right click this point fizz on
right-handed<00:01:24.299> put<00:01:25.110> a<00:01:25.140> bit<00:01:25.320> more<00:01:25.350> of<00:01:25.500> you<00:01:25.710> your

00:01:26.539 --> 00:01:26.549 
right-handed put a bit more of you your

00:01:26.549 --> 00:01:30.140 
right-handed put a bit more of you your
braided<00:01:26.880> main<00:01:27.030> line<00:01:27.240> through<00:01:28.880> put<00:01:29.880> it<00:01:29.970> along

00:01:30.140 --> 00:01:30.150 
braided main line through put it along

00:01:30.150 --> 00:01:35.390 
braided main line through put it along
about<00:01:30.270> syringes<00:01:31.080> and<00:01:31.490> then<00:01:34.009> form<00:01:35.009> a<00:01:35.100> loop<00:01:35.250> it

00:01:35.390 --> 00:01:35.400 
about syringes and then form a loop it

00:01:35.400 --> 00:01:38.389 
about syringes and then form a loop it
around<00:01:35.700> the<00:01:36.690> shop<00:01:37.140> leader<00:01:37.350> and<00:01:38.040> then<00:01:38.159> all<00:01:38.250> you

00:01:38.389 --> 00:01:38.399 
around the shop leader and then all you

00:01:38.399 --> 00:01:41.930 
around the shop leader and then all you
do<00:01:38.550> is<00:01:39.540> keeping<00:01:39.960> hold<00:01:40.140> of<00:01:40.229> that<00:01:40.320> loop<00:01:40.790> in<00:01:41.790> this

00:01:41.930 --> 00:01:41.940 
do is keeping hold of that loop in this

00:01:41.940 --> 00:01:45.289 
do is keeping hold of that loop in this
thumb<00:01:42.420> and<00:01:42.570> forefinger<00:01:43.460> it's<00:01:44.460> programmed<00:01:44.940> a

00:01:45.289 --> 00:01:45.299 
thumb and forefinger it's programmed a

00:01:45.299 --> 00:01:47.270 
thumb and forefinger it's programmed a
lot<00:01:45.960> to<00:01:46.080> go<00:01:46.200> around<00:01:46.229> about<00:01:46.649> seven<00:01:47.070> or<00:01:47.159> eight

00:01:47.270 --> 00:01:47.280 
lot to go around about seven or eight

00:01:47.280 --> 00:01:52.190 
lot to go around about seven or eight
times<00:01:47.310> I<00:01:50.119> found<00:01:51.119> this<00:01:51.240> lesson<00:01:51.690> never<00:01:51.929> let<00:01:52.110> me

00:01:52.190 --> 00:01:52.200 
times I found this lesson never let me

00:01:52.200 --> 00:01:54.469 
times I found this lesson never let me
do<00:01:52.289> how<00:01:52.380> it's<00:01:52.500> never<00:01:52.619> slip<00:01:52.950> then<00:01:53.850> we<00:01:54.000> do<00:01:54.119> pause

00:01:54.469 --> 00:01:54.479 
do how it's never slip then we do pause

00:01:54.479 --> 00:01:55.760 
do how it's never slip then we do pause
that<00:01:54.660> again<00:01:54.990> through<00:01:55.200> the<00:01:55.380> loop<00:01:55.530> that<00:01:55.560> you've

00:01:55.760 --> 00:01:55.770 
that again through the loop that you've

00:01:55.770 --> 00:02:00.980 
that again through the loop that you've
been<00:01:55.890> hanging<00:01:56.160> on<00:01:56.280> to<00:01:59.119> pull<00:02:00.119> that's<00:02:00.630> alright

00:02:00.980 --> 00:02:00.990 
been hanging on to pull that's alright

00:02:00.990 --> 00:02:04.160 
been hanging on to pull that's alright
lots<00:02:01.710> of<00:02:01.860> that<00:02:02.039> other<00:02:02.700> mutton<00:02:03.090> the<00:02:03.179> leader<00:02:03.360> put

00:02:04.160 --> 00:02:04.170 
lots of that other mutton the leader put

00:02:04.170 --> 00:02:08.359 
lots of that other mutton the leader put
it<00:02:04.289> really<00:02:04.619> tight<00:02:05.240> and<00:02:06.240> they<00:02:06.420> have<00:02:06.780> a<00:02:07.369> really

00:02:08.359 --> 00:02:08.369 
it really tight and they have a really

in<00:02:20.700> this<00:02:20.819> if<00:02:20.940> you're<00:02:21.060> using<00:02:21.090> really<00:02:21.780> thin

00:02:22.100 --> 00:02:22.110 
in this if you're using really thin

00:02:22.110 --> 00:02:25.210 
in this if you're using really thin
braids<00:02:22.380> say<00:02:22.650> ten<00:02:22.920> or<00:02:22.950> fifteen<00:02:23.370> pound<00:02:23.670> braid

00:02:25.210 --> 00:02:25.220 
braids say ten or fifteen pound braid

00:02:25.220 --> 00:02:29.090 
braids say ten or fifteen pound braid
before<00:02:26.220> you<00:02:26.610> freak<00:02:26.850> the<00:02:26.970> braid<00:02:27.209> through<00:02:28.100> just

00:02:29.090 --> 00:02:29.100 
before you freak the braid through just

00:02:29.100 --> 00:02:32.000 
before you freak the braid through just
double<00:02:29.340> it<00:02:29.400> over<00:02:29.840> so<00:02:30.840> and<00:02:31.500> then<00:02:31.590> just<00:02:31.620> repeat

00:02:32.000 --> 00:02:32.010 
double it over so and then just repeat

00:02:32.010 --> 00:02:32.600 
double it over so and then just repeat
the<00:02:32.130> process

00:02:32.600 --> 00:02:32.610 
the process

00:02:32.610 --> 00:02:34.720 
the process
put<00:02:33.150> it<00:02:33.239> through<00:02:33.329> pull<00:02:33.720> your<00:02:33.870> leader<00:02:33.989> up<00:02:34.170> tight

00:02:34.720 --> 00:02:34.730 
put it through pull your leader up tight

00:02:34.730 --> 00:02:38.030 
put it through pull your leader up tight
form<00:02:35.730> the<00:02:35.910> loop<00:02:36.230> wrap<00:02:37.230> it<00:02:37.410> around<00:02:37.470> itself

00:02:38.030 --> 00:02:38.040 
form the loop wrap it around itself

00:02:38.040 --> 00:02:41.690 
form the loop wrap it around itself
seven<00:02:38.940> times<00:02:39.350> back<00:02:40.350> through<00:02:40.620> that<00:02:41.370> really

00:02:41.690 --> 00:02:41.700 
seven times back through that really

00:02:41.700 --> 00:02:43.009 
seven times back through that really
does<00:02:41.940> give<00:02:42.120> you<00:02:42.180> an<00:02:42.269> extra<00:02:42.510> bit<00:02:42.630> of<00:02:42.660> added

00:02:43.009 --> 00:02:43.019 
does give you an extra bit of added

00:02:43.019 --> 00:02:44.569 
does give you an extra bit of added
security<00:02:43.140> when<00:02:43.709> you're<00:02:43.799> using<00:02:43.980> really<00:02:44.459> light

00:02:44.569 --> 00:02:44.579 
security when you're using really light

00:02:44.579 --> 00:02:46.940 
security when you're using really light
brains<00:02:44.970> so<00:02:45.540> learn<00:02:46.140> that<00:02:46.290> one<00:02:46.470> and<00:02:46.739> you'll

00:02:46.940 --> 00:02:46.950 
brains so learn that one and you'll

00:02:46.950 --> 00:02:49.579 
brains so learn that one and you'll
never<00:02:47.040> have<00:02:47.190> a<00:02:47.280> problem
