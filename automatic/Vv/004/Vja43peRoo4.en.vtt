January<00:00:11.280> 26<00:00:11.849> and<00:00:12.150> these<00:00:12.300> seedlings<00:00:12.570> were

00:00:13.459 --> 00:00:13.469 
January 26 and these seedlings were

00:00:13.469 --> 00:00:15.620 
January 26 and these seedlings were
started<00:00:13.920> brilliant<00:00:14.429> only<00:00:14.759> about<00:00:14.910> 5<00:00:15.150> or<00:00:15.179> 6<00:00:15.480> days

00:00:15.630 --> 00:00:17.210 
started brilliant only about 5 or 6 days
ago<00:00:15.690> so<00:00:16.049> they<00:00:16.170> sprouted<00:00:16.440> up<00:00:16.619> quickly<00:00:16.830> but<00:00:17.039> it's

you<00:00:20.430> really<00:00:20.670> don't<00:00:20.760> start<00:00:21.119> these<00:00:21.270> really

00:00:21.620 --> 00:00:21.630 
you really don't start these really

00:00:21.630 --> 00:00:23.599 
you really don't start these really
until<00:00:21.900> March<00:00:22.109> but<00:00:23.070> I<00:00:23.100> wanted<00:00:23.369> to<00:00:23.430> take<00:00:23.580> a

00:00:25.250 --> 00:00:25.260 
mystery away why because when you read

00:00:25.260 --> 00:00:28.370 
mystery away why because when you read
the<00:00:25.380> back<00:00:25.590> of<00:00:26.539> then<00:00:27.539> you<00:00:27.570> know<00:00:27.750> the<00:00:27.900> seed<00:00:28.109> packs

00:00:28.370 --> 00:00:28.380 
the back of then you know the seed packs

00:00:28.380 --> 00:00:29.990 
the back of then you know the seed packs
that's<00:00:28.650> tomato<00:00:28.859> seeds<00:00:29.220> sometimes<00:00:29.460> it<00:00:29.789> says

00:00:29.990 --> 00:00:30.000 
that's tomato seeds sometimes it says

00:00:30.000 --> 00:00:31.910 
that's tomato seeds sometimes it says
plant<00:00:30.660> them<00:00:30.810> a<00:00:30.840> quarter<00:00:31.230> inch<00:00:31.439> deep<00:00:31.619> plant

00:00:31.910 --> 00:00:31.920 
plant them a quarter inch deep plant

00:00:31.920 --> 00:00:34.090 
plant them a quarter inch deep plant
them<00:00:32.070> an<00:00:32.189> eighth<00:00:32.340> of<00:00:32.460> an<00:00:32.579> inch<00:00:32.669> deep<00:00:32.940> it's

00:00:34.090 --> 00:00:34.100 
them an eighth of an inch deep it's

00:00:34.100 --> 00:00:36.620 
them an eighth of an inch deep it's
somewhat<00:00:35.100> unsettling<00:00:35.520> sometimes<00:00:35.940> when<00:00:36.239> your

00:00:36.620 --> 00:00:36.630 
somewhat unsettling sometimes when your

00:00:36.630 --> 00:00:38.750 
somewhat unsettling sometimes when your
garden<00:00:36.989> for<00:00:37.140> the<00:00:37.230> first<00:00:37.440> time<00:00:37.680> don't<00:00:38.309> worry

00:00:38.750 --> 00:00:38.760 
garden for the first time don't worry

00:00:38.760 --> 00:00:41.000 
garden for the first time don't worry
about<00:00:38.969> it<00:00:39.329> okay<00:00:39.960> and<00:00:40.200> here's<00:00:40.500> why

00:00:41.000 --> 00:00:41.010 
about it okay and here's why

00:00:41.010 --> 00:00:43.700 
about it okay and here's why
I<00:00:41.040> set<00:00:41.969> up<00:00:42.000> my<00:00:42.210> little<00:00:42.390> experiment<00:00:42.899> these<00:00:43.559> are

00:00:43.700 --> 00:00:43.710 
I set up my little experiment these are

00:00:43.710 --> 00:00:45.950 
I set up my little experiment these are
the<00:00:43.800> normal<00:00:43.980> seed<00:00:44.370> starting<00:00:44.820> cells<00:00:45.090> that<00:00:45.629> you

00:00:45.950 --> 00:00:45.960 
the normal seed starting cells that you

00:00:45.960 --> 00:00:49.130 
the normal seed starting cells that you
would<00:00:46.289> start<00:00:46.800> your<00:00:47.579> tomato<00:00:47.850> season<00:00:48.110> so<00:00:49.110> I

00:00:49.130 --> 00:00:49.140 
would start your tomato season so I

00:00:49.140 --> 00:00:51.350 
would start your tomato season so I
filled<00:00:49.500> the<00:00:49.620> soil<00:00:49.860> to<00:00:50.460> about<00:00:50.640> here<00:00:50.940> a<00:00:51.000> quarter

00:00:51.350 --> 00:00:51.360 
filled the soil to about here a quarter

00:00:51.360 --> 00:00:53.150 
filled the soil to about here a quarter
of<00:00:51.420> the<00:00:51.510> way<00:00:51.629> half<00:00:52.230> the<00:00:52.469> way<00:00:52.590> and<00:00:52.800> this<00:00:52.860> is<00:00:52.920> how

00:00:53.150 --> 00:00:53.160 
of the way half the way and this is how

00:00:53.160 --> 00:00:55.220 
of the way half the way and this is how
I<00:00:53.190> normally<00:00:53.309> fill<00:00:53.910> it<00:00:54.030> and<00:00:54.420> I<00:00:54.510> dropped<00:00:54.780> into<00:00:54.960> me

00:00:55.220 --> 00:00:55.230 
I normally fill it and I dropped into me

00:00:55.230 --> 00:00:57.020 
I normally fill it and I dropped into me
the<00:00:55.379> seeds<00:00:55.590> and<00:00:55.829> let's<00:00:56.010> see<00:00:56.190> I<00:00:56.430> can<00:00:56.760> get<00:00:56.910> that

00:00:57.020 --> 00:00:57.030 
the seeds and let's see I can get that

00:00:57.030 --> 00:00:59.270 
the seeds and let's see I can get that
in<00:00:57.210> there<00:00:57.390> so<00:00:58.260> this<00:00:58.410> is<00:00:58.469> a<00:00:58.620> quarter<00:00:58.949> filled

00:00:59.270 --> 00:00:59.280 
in there so this is a quarter filled

00:00:59.280 --> 00:01:01.160 
in there so this is a quarter filled
with<00:00:59.430> soil<00:00:59.609> half<00:01:00.059> filled<00:01:00.359> with<00:01:00.420> starting<00:01:00.989> mix

00:01:01.160 --> 00:01:01.170 
with soil half filled with starting mix

00:01:01.170 --> 00:01:03.260 
with soil half filled with starting mix
in<00:01:01.500> the<00:01:01.800> normal<00:01:02.160> way<00:01:02.219> and<00:01:02.250> my<00:01:02.460> normal<00:01:02.789> way<00:01:02.879> is

00:01:03.260 --> 00:01:03.270 
in the normal way and my normal way is

00:01:03.270 --> 00:01:06.410 
in the normal way and my normal way is
really<00:01:03.539> you<00:01:04.199> just<00:01:04.409> drop<00:01:04.589> them<00:01:04.739> on<00:01:04.830> top<00:01:05.420> press

00:01:06.410 --> 00:01:06.420 
really you just drop them on top press

00:01:06.420 --> 00:01:08.120 
really you just drop them on top press
them<00:01:06.600> down<00:01:06.630> maybe<00:01:07.380> a<00:01:07.560> quarter<00:01:07.830> of<00:01:07.979> an<00:01:08.040> inch

00:01:08.120 --> 00:01:08.130 
them down maybe a quarter of an inch

00:01:08.130 --> 00:01:10.310 
them down maybe a quarter of an inch
like<00:01:08.520> I<00:01:08.640> said<00:01:08.820> it<00:01:08.909> doesn't<00:01:09.090> matter<00:01:09.299> you<00:01:10.290> just

00:01:10.310 --> 00:01:10.320 
like I said it doesn't matter you just

00:01:10.320 --> 00:01:11.539 
like I said it doesn't matter you just
want<00:01:10.619> to<00:01:10.680> press<00:01:10.860> them<00:01:11.010> and<00:01:11.130> make<00:01:11.280> sure<00:01:11.310> they're

00:01:11.539 --> 00:01:11.549 
want to press them and make sure they're

00:01:11.549 --> 00:01:14.840 
want to press them and make sure they're
covered<00:01:11.909> and<00:01:12.090> then<00:01:12.210> cover<00:01:12.750> it<00:01:12.900> over<00:01:13.820> but<00:01:14.820> I

00:01:14.840 --> 00:01:14.850 
covered and then cover it over but I

00:01:14.850 --> 00:01:17.060 
covered and then cover it over but I
also<00:01:15.060> dropped<00:01:15.360> in<00:01:15.600> seeds<00:01:15.900> at<00:01:16.049> the<00:01:16.140> same<00:01:16.740> exact

00:01:17.060 --> 00:01:17.070 
also dropped in seeds at the same exact

00:01:17.070 --> 00:01:18.920 
also dropped in seeds at the same exact
time<00:01:17.340> with<00:01:17.729> a<00:01:17.970> little<00:01:18.240> bit<00:01:18.360> of<00:01:18.450> soil<00:01:18.630> down<00:01:18.810> at

00:01:18.920 --> 00:01:18.930 
time with a little bit of soil down at

00:01:18.930 --> 00:01:21.289 
time with a little bit of soil down at
the<00:01:19.020> bottom<00:01:19.170> soil<00:01:19.680> about<00:01:19.860> half<00:01:20.070> way<00:01:20.340> and<00:01:20.549> of

00:01:21.289 --> 00:01:21.299 
the bottom soil about half way and of

00:01:21.299 --> 00:01:24.649 
the bottom soil about half way and of
course<00:01:21.570> when<00:01:21.930> you<00:01:22.020> would<00:01:22.140> go<00:01:22.259> to<00:01:22.290> fill<00:01:22.619> it<00:01:23.659> you

00:01:24.649 --> 00:01:24.659 
course when you would go to fill it you

00:01:24.659 --> 00:01:26.630 
course when you would go to fill it you
know<00:01:24.780> they<00:01:25.320> would<00:01:25.500> have<00:01:25.650> to<00:01:25.770> go<00:01:25.890> through<00:01:26.250> a<00:01:26.400> lot

00:01:26.630 --> 00:01:26.640 
know they would have to go through a lot

00:01:26.640 --> 00:01:29.749 
know they would have to go through a lot
more<00:01:26.670> soil<00:01:27.150> to<00:01:27.479> Germany<00:01:27.930> well<00:01:28.710> about<00:01:29.040> five<00:01:29.369> six

00:01:29.749 --> 00:01:29.759 
more soil to Germany well about five six

00:01:29.759 --> 00:01:32.510 
more soil to Germany well about five six
seven<00:01:30.090> days<00:01:30.210> later<00:01:30.710> they<00:01:31.710> all<00:01:31.860> sprouted<00:01:32.430> up

00:01:32.510 --> 00:01:32.520 
seven days later they all sprouted up

00:01:32.520 --> 00:01:34.460 
seven days later they all sprouted up
just<00:01:32.909> about<00:01:33.119> at<00:01:33.299> the<00:01:33.390> same<00:01:33.630> time<00:01:33.900> it<00:01:34.079> didn't

00:01:34.460 --> 00:01:34.470 
just about at the same time it didn't
