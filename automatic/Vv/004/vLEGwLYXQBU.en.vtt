over here and as you see that spiral

00:01:38.930 --> 00:01:40.210 
over here and as you see that spiral
pattern<00:01:39.259> that's<00:01:39.439> kind<00:01:39.650> of<00:01:39.680> how<00:01:39.799> you<00:01:39.860> want<00:01:40.159> it

00:01:40.210 --> 00:01:40.220 
pattern that's kind of how you want it

00:01:40.220 --> 00:01:42.490

00:01:42.490 --> 00:01:42.500 
to be if it's a solid pattern and it's

00:01:42.500 --> 00:01:44.830 
to be if it's a solid pattern and it's
just<00:01:42.770> there's<00:01:43.729> no<00:01:43.850> pattern<00:01:44.180> it's<00:01:44.360> just<00:01:44.570> solid

00:01:44.830 --> 00:01:44.840 
just there's no pattern it's just solid

four<00:01:56.149> full<00:01:56.540> spoonfuls<00:01:57.140> and<00:01:57.409> you<00:01:57.590> just<00:01:57.740> get<00:01:57.920> it

00:01:58.030 --> 00:01:58.040 
four full spoonfuls and you just get it

00:01:58.040 --> 00:01:59.530 
four full spoonfuls and you just get it
wet<00:01:58.219> and<00:01:58.250> drop<00:01:58.549> it<00:01:58.700> around<00:01:58.939> the<00:01:59.060> far<00:01:59.299> edges

00:01:59.530 --> 00:01:59.540 
wet and drop it around the far edges

00:01:59.540 --> 00:02:01.569 
wet and drop it around the far edges
I'll<00:02:00.500> show<00:02:00.680> you<00:02:00.770> guys<00:02:00.860> that<00:02:01.040> when<00:02:01.219> we<00:02:01.340> run<00:02:01.490> the

00:02:01.569 --> 00:02:01.579 
I'll show you guys that when we run the

00:02:01.579 --> 00:02:06.760 
I'll show you guys that when we run the
finer<00:02:01.790> material<00:02:02.829> so<00:02:03.829> you<00:02:03.890> want<00:02:04.130> to<00:02:04.219> get<00:02:05.770> get

00:02:06.760 --> 00:02:06.770 
finer material so you want to get get

00:02:06.770 --> 00:02:11.290 
finer material so you want to get get
the<00:02:06.950> water<00:02:07.130> level<00:02:07.549> up<00:02:07.700> and<00:02:08.860> how<00:02:09.860> I<00:02:09.890> do<00:02:10.099> it<00:02:10.459> is<00:02:10.729> I

00:02:11.290 --> 00:02:11.300 
the water level up and how I do it is I

00:02:11.300 --> 00:02:12.660 
the water level up and how I do it is I
don't<00:02:11.360> have<00:02:11.510> lines<00:02:11.810> on<00:02:12.080> it<00:02:12.110> but

00:02:12.660 --> 00:02:12.670 
don't have lines on it but

00:02:12.670 --> 00:02:17.070 
don't have lines on it but
for<00:02:12.990> the<00:02:13.990> 30<00:02:14.230> measure<00:02:14.470> higher<00:02:14.830> I<00:02:15.190> run<00:02:15.970> about<00:02:16.240> a

00:02:17.070 --> 00:02:17.080 
for the 30 measure higher I run about a

00:02:17.080 --> 00:02:19.229 
for the 30 measure higher I run about a
quarter<00:02:17.709> inch<00:02:17.739> from<00:02:18.310> the<00:02:18.430> top<00:02:18.640> because<00:02:19.150> a

00:02:19.229 --> 00:02:19.239 
quarter inch from the top because a

00:02:19.239 --> 00:02:23.580 
quarter inch from the top because a
little<00:02:19.660> bit<00:02:19.780> heavier<00:02:20.050> material<00:02:20.590> and<00:02:21.569> the<00:02:22.590> more

00:02:23.580 --> 00:02:23.590 
little bit heavier material and the more

00:02:23.590 --> 00:02:25.559 
little bit heavier material and the more
powerful<00:02:23.890> your<00:02:24.160> sump<00:02:24.489> pump<00:02:24.760> is<00:02:24.940> the<00:02:25.120> less

00:02:25.559 --> 00:02:25.569 
powerful your sump pump is the less

00:02:25.569 --> 00:02:28.350 
powerful your sump pump is the less
sense<00:02:26.290> yeah<00:02:26.980> the<00:02:27.130> less<00:02:27.340> adjustability<00:02:28.060> or

00:02:28.350 --> 00:02:28.360 
sense yeah the less adjustability or

00:02:28.360 --> 00:02:29.970 
sense yeah the less adjustability or
sensitivity<00:02:29.080> you<00:02:29.140> have<00:02:29.290> on<00:02:29.440> the<00:02:29.530> valve<00:02:29.739> so

00:02:29.970 --> 00:02:29.980 
sensitivity you have on the valve so

00:02:29.980 --> 00:02:31.110 
sensitivity you have on the valve so
I've<00:02:30.100> got<00:02:30.250> to<00:02:30.310> be<00:02:30.400> really<00:02:30.610> careful<00:02:30.819> I'm

00:02:31.110 --> 00:02:31.120 
I've got to be really careful I'm

00:02:31.120 --> 00:02:35.010 
I've got to be really careful I'm
running<00:02:31.360> a<00:02:31.450> heavy<00:02:31.709> gph<00:02:32.709> pump<00:02:32.739> and<00:02:33.690> it's<00:02:34.690> really

00:02:35.010 --> 00:02:35.020 
running a heavy gph pump and it's really

00:02:35.020 --> 00:02:36.720 
running a heavy gph pump and it's really
easy<00:02:35.110> to<00:02:35.470> blow<00:02:35.620> this<00:02:35.800> stuff<00:02:36.040> out<00:02:36.250> when<00:02:36.610> you

00:02:36.720 --> 00:02:36.730 
easy to blow this stuff out when you

00:02:36.730 --> 00:02:38.580 
easy to blow this stuff out when you
don't<00:02:36.819> have<00:02:36.970> a<00:02:37.030> lot<00:02:37.180> of<00:02:37.209> valve<00:02:37.450> control<00:02:37.930> but

00:02:38.580 --> 00:02:38.590 
don't have a lot of valve control but

00:02:38.590 --> 00:02:39.809 
don't have a lot of valve control but
all<00:02:38.860> right<00:02:38.920> I'm<00:02:39.040> going<00:02:39.160> to<00:02:39.190> bring<00:02:39.400> it<00:02:39.519> up<00:02:39.670> now

00:02:39.809 --> 00:02:39.819 
all right I'm going to bring it up now

00:02:39.819 --> 00:02:43.410 
all right I'm going to bring it up now
to<00:02:40.800> maybe<00:02:41.800> a<00:02:42.550> little<00:02:42.730> less<00:02:42.940> than<00:02:43.120> a<00:02:43.239> quarter

00:02:43.410 --> 00:02:43.420 
to maybe a little less than a quarter

00:02:43.420 --> 00:02:45.930 
to maybe a little less than a quarter
inch<00:02:43.569> I'm<00:02:43.930> going<00:02:44.050> to<00:02:44.140> stay<00:02:44.349> I<00:02:44.800> see<00:02:45.550> some<00:02:45.730> gold

00:02:45.930 --> 00:02:45.940 
inch I'm going to stay I see some gold

00:02:45.940 --> 00:02:47.490 
inch I'm going to stay I see some gold
uncovering<00:02:46.450> so<00:02:46.630> I'm<00:02:46.720> going<00:02:46.870> to<00:02:46.900> stay<00:02:47.080> probably

00:02:47.490 --> 00:02:47.500 
uncovering so I'm going to stay probably

00:02:49.209 --> 00:02:51.240 
about a half inch from the top right now
and<00:02:49.540> as<00:02:49.630> to<00:02:49.930> not<00:02:50.080> blow<00:02:50.260> too<00:02:50.410> much<00:02:50.560> material<00:02:51.100> out

00:02:51.240 --> 00:02:51.250 
and as to not blow too much material out

00:02:51.250 --> 00:02:57.030 
and as to not blow too much material out
as<00:02:51.549> you<00:02:52.510> can<00:02:52.690> tell<00:02:55.080> makes<00:02:56.080> a<00:02:56.170> nice<00:02:56.319> art<00:02:56.680> pattern

as you can tell makes a nice art pattern
you<00:02:57.190> want<00:02:57.280> to<00:02:57.370> see<00:02:57.519> a<00:02:57.549> lot<00:02:57.730> of<00:02:57.760> material

00:02:57.900 --> 00:02:57.910

bucket under the blue bowl as to not
blow<00:03:13.090> your<00:03:13.120> material<00:03:13.780> out<00:03:14.040> that<00:03:15.040> way<00:03:15.220> if<00:03:15.370> you

00:03:15.479 --> 00:03:15.489 
blow your material out that way if you

00:03:15.489 --> 00:03:17.190 
blow your material out that way if you
do<00:03:15.730> miss<00:03:15.940> some<00:03:16.120> gold<00:03:16.360> or<00:03:16.600> you<00:03:16.690> blow<00:03:16.870> anything

00:03:17.190 --> 00:03:17.200 
do miss some gold or you blow anything

00:03:17.200 --> 00:03:19.170 
do miss some gold or you blow anything
out<00:03:17.320> you<00:03:17.680> can<00:03:17.829> just<00:03:17.859> run<00:03:18.609> it<00:03:18.730> back<00:03:18.880> through

00:03:19.170 --> 00:03:19.180 
out you can just run it back through

00:03:19.180 --> 00:03:23.539 
out you can just run it back through
again<00:03:20.400> okay<00:03:21.400> so<00:03:21.910> what<00:03:22.720> I'm<00:03:22.810> going<00:03:22.930> to<00:03:22.959> do<00:03:23.109> is

00:03:23.539 --> 00:03:23.549 
again okay so what I'm going to do is

00:03:23.549 --> 00:03:26.490 
again okay so what I'm going to do is
let<00:03:24.549> this<00:03:24.700> run<00:03:25.030> I<00:03:25.450> probably<00:03:25.840> ran<00:03:26.049> a<00:03:26.109> little<00:03:26.350> too

00:03:26.490 --> 00:03:26.500 
let this run I probably ran a little too

00:03:26.500 --> 00:03:28.050 
let this run I probably ran a little too
fast<00:03:26.680> this<00:03:26.920> time<00:03:27.190> but<00:03:27.430> I'm<00:03:27.519> left<00:03:27.730> it's<00:03:27.850> run

00:03:28.050 --> 00:03:28.060 
fast this time but I'm left it's run

00:03:28.060 --> 00:03:30.479 
fast this time but I'm left it's run
redistribute<00:03:28.720> the<00:03:28.840> material<00:03:29.290> real<00:03:29.440> quick<00:03:29.739> and

00:03:30.479 --> 00:03:30.489 
redistribute the material real quick and

00:03:30.489 --> 00:03:33.480 
redistribute the material real quick and
I'll<00:03:30.579> be<00:03:30.730> back<00:03:30.970> with<00:03:31.239> you
