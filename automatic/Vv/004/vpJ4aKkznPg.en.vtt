00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.060
 to 

00:00:04.490 --> 00:00:08.719
 if you already get bored you android if 

00:00:06.859 --> 00:00:10.670
 you were anxious to see a smartphone 

00:00:08.719 --> 00:00:12.860
 completely different from the others 

00:00:10.670 --> 00:00:15.230
 this first amazon phone 

00:00:12.860 --> 00:00:16.550
 Your curiosity will awaken as you stay and 

00:00:15.230 --> 00:00:18.710
 vanessa hand orellana for cinema in 

00:00:16.550 --> 00:00:20.779
 Spanish to give them one more look at 

00:00:18.710 --> 00:00:23.119
 background to amazon fire phone 

00:00:20.779 --> 00:00:25.340
 I know what you want to see and let us go 

00:00:23.119 --> 00:00:27.529
 straight to the point I show you first the 

00:00:25.340 --> 00:00:30.050
 3d effect of the lock screen 

00:00:27.529 --> 00:00:32.960
 that only this phone has the 

00:00:30.050 --> 00:00:35.720
 ability to recognize objects with only 

00:00:32.960 --> 00:00:38.479
 activate the camera and now that I have your 

00:00:35.720 --> 00:00:40.280
 attention, let's continue with the rest, apart from 

00:00:38.479 --> 00:00:42.320
 this striking image on the screen of 

00:00:40.280 --> 00:00:44.150
 blocking the design itself is not very 

00:00:42.320 --> 00:00:46.129
 Novelty as you see is almost done 

00:00:44.150 --> 00:00:49.129
 completely glass in the part 

00:00:46.129 --> 00:00:51.589
 back and front surrounded by an edge 

00:00:49.129 --> 00:00:53.839
 thick plastic in theory sounds 

00:00:51.589 --> 00:00:56.750
 elegant but already seeing it up close and with 

00:00:53.839 --> 00:00:58.729
 this huge the white amazon logo already 

00:00:56.750 --> 00:01:00.170
 it does not seem so attractive to me at least 

00:00:58.729 --> 00:01:02.720
 compare it with its rival assumptions 

00:01:00.170 --> 00:01:05.840
 like the stage and one m 8 the samsung 

00:01:02.720 --> 00:01:07.760
 galaxy s 5 or even the iphone 5 s 

00:01:05.840 --> 00:01:10.630
 it also feels heavier in my hands 

00:01:07.760 --> 00:01:14.330
 although it only weighs 160 grams just like 

00:01:10.630 --> 00:01:16.520
 m 8 the previous one is bigger but more 

00:01:14.330 --> 00:01:19.220
 thin and I think the weight is 

00:01:16.520 --> 00:01:21.350
 better distributed in this has buttons 

00:01:19.220 --> 00:01:22.940
 on the edge and one of menu below the 

00:01:21.350 --> 00:01:25.550
 screen just like the iphone and the 

00:01:22.940 --> 00:01:27.500
 galaxy s 5 but it does not have the icons that 

00:01:25.550 --> 00:01:30.500
 they light up on the sides as in android 

00:01:27.500 --> 00:01:33.530
 the screen measures 4.7 inches high 

00:01:30.500 --> 00:01:35.420
 720p definition looks good image 

00:01:33.530 --> 00:01:37.130
 but it does not have the same sharpness as the 

00:01:35.420 --> 00:01:39.260
 full hd of other phones in your 

00:01:37.130 --> 00:01:41.270
 category will see five little dots surrounding 

00:01:39.260 --> 00:01:43.369
 the screen the four in the corners 

00:01:41.270 --> 00:01:45.470
 they are cameras that record the movement 

00:01:43.369 --> 00:01:47.869
 of the look to create that effect in 

00:01:45.470 --> 00:01:50.600
 3-d and the fifth is the front camera 

00:01:47.869 --> 00:01:52.940
 for it was officiated calls in video of 2.1 

00:01:50.600 --> 00:01:54.530
 megapixels press the button once 

00:01:52.940 --> 00:01:57.259
 next to activate the main camera 

00:01:54.530 --> 00:02:00.110
 of 13 megapixels that also records video 

00:01:57.259 --> 00:02:01.580
 in 1080p high definition took photos 

00:02:00.110 --> 00:02:03.440
 of good quality when tested 

00:02:01.580 --> 00:02:05.360
 but note that outdoor photos 

00:02:03.440 --> 00:02:07.100
 they went on exposed and had 

00:02:05.360 --> 00:02:09.200
 problems in low light environments 

00:02:07.100 --> 00:02:10.820
 keep this same button pressed 

00:02:09.200 --> 00:02:13.130
 for a few seconds to activate 

00:02:10.820 --> 00:02:14.900
 firefly the amazon application that you 

00:02:13.130 --> 00:02:15.720
 allows you to scan a variety of things 

00:02:14.900 --> 00:02:18.060
 since 

00:02:15.720 --> 00:02:20.610
 it's up to movies up cards 

00:02:18.060 --> 00:02:22.440
 presentation is very useful for storing 

00:02:20.610 --> 00:02:24.690
 contacts and look for music but the 

00:02:22.440 --> 00:02:26.520
 concept is not new and there are already several 

00:02:24.690 --> 00:02:28.800
 apps that allow you to do the same in 

00:02:26.520 --> 00:02:30.990
 android and ios but the goal is 

00:02:28.800 --> 00:02:33.300
 clear to make you buy more of that 

00:02:30.990 --> 00:02:35.280
 product in the Amazon store the 

00:02:33.300 --> 00:02:37.050
 interface is similar to other products of 

00:02:35.280 --> 00:02:38.640
 amazon as the king of fighters and already the 

00:02:37.050 --> 00:02:40.860
 have you seen has android as a system 

00:02:38.640 --> 00:02:43.200
 base operative but it's very modified 

00:02:40.860 --> 00:02:44.880
 as you can see the start menu is different 

00:02:43.200 --> 00:02:46.590
 to what we usually see with a 

00:02:44.880 --> 00:02:49.620
 main reel of the apps you have 

00:02:46.590 --> 00:02:51.810
 open with the 3d effect and moving 

00:02:49.620 --> 00:02:53.130
 down you have the full menu of 

00:02:51.810 --> 00:02:55.260
 applications cost me a bit 

00:02:53.130 --> 00:02:57.090
 get used to the navigation but I do not 

00:02:55.260 --> 00:02:59.160
 dislike you can control certain 

00:02:57.090 --> 00:03:01.350
 functions based gestures towards 

00:02:59.160 --> 00:03:03.300
 left to see notifications towards 

00:03:01.350 --> 00:03:05.459
 right for menu options and 

00:03:03.300 --> 00:03:07.530
 down for the shortcuts and if you 

00:03:05.459 --> 00:03:09.570
 you lose or you get dizzy the phone 

00:03:07.530 --> 00:03:10.200
 offers a tutorial or a call from 

00:03:09.570 --> 00:03:12.420
 help 

00:03:10.200 --> 00:03:14.670
 mayday connects you with a person who 

00:03:12.420 --> 00:03:16.560
 help at all times but is not yet 

00:03:14.670 --> 00:03:18.390
 available in Spanish has its own 

00:03:16.560 --> 00:03:21.030
 application of maps and you can see certain 

00:03:18.390 --> 00:03:23.370
 buildings with the effect in 3-d but 

00:03:21.030 --> 00:03:25.230
 in the traffic report and as amazon 

00:03:23.370 --> 00:03:27.750
 blocks many google play services 

00:03:25.230 --> 00:03:29.459
 you will not find google maps and it does not count 

00:03:27.750 --> 00:03:31.410
 with the same variety of apps in your 

00:03:29.459 --> 00:03:34.080
 ecosystem and now let's go back to the 

00:03:31.410 --> 00:03:36.060
 effects in 3d the dynamic perspective is 

00:03:34.080 --> 00:03:37.770
 looks in amazon video games but 

00:03:36.060 --> 00:03:39.660
 the rest was easy to forget that 

00:03:37.770 --> 00:03:41.430
 existed on the phone it seems like a 

00:03:39.660 --> 00:03:43.709
 good try to do something different in 

00:03:41.430 --> 00:03:45.690
 the market but the heavy graphs of 

00:03:43.709 --> 00:03:47.880
 this phone will reduce the speed 

00:03:45.690 --> 00:03:50.280
 quad-core processor in others 

00:03:47.880 --> 00:03:52.709
 phones the snapdragon 800 from qualcomm 

00:03:50.280 --> 00:03:54.180
 it's powerful enough but in 

00:03:52.709 --> 00:03:56.070
 this feels slow 

00:03:54.180 --> 00:03:58.260
 further heated body after 

00:03:56.070 --> 00:04:00.390
 use it a lot and it does not come with slot for 

00:03:58.260 --> 00:04:03.420
 microsd card so you have to 

00:04:00.390 --> 00:04:05.430
 buy the 32 or 64 gigabyte version 

00:04:03.420 --> 00:04:07.560
 of internal storage and it's not a 

00:04:05.430 --> 00:04:09.690
 cheap phone the fire phone is already 

00:04:07.560 --> 00:04:12.959
 available for $ 200 in contract 

00:04:09.690 --> 00:04:14.940
 exclusive with haiti in you or 650 dollars 

00:04:12.959 --> 00:04:16.620
 unlocked by the time they are 

00:04:14.940 --> 00:04:19.049
 offering with one year of service 

00:04:16.620 --> 00:04:21.479
 free amazon prime that includes you 

00:04:19.049 --> 00:04:23.370
 Free shipping and discounts conclusion 

00:04:21.479 --> 00:04:25.710
 a brave attempt at amazon for 

00:04:23.370 --> 00:04:27.090
 excel in a saturated market but 

00:04:25.710 --> 00:04:29.160
 all these ornaments 

00:04:27.090 --> 00:04:30.750
 adding up a lot and for this price better 

00:04:29.160 --> 00:04:33.270
 stay with a luxury phone with 

00:04:30.750 --> 00:04:34.350
 more mature operating system write me
