00:00:01.590 --> 00:00:05.380
 good afternoon now behind my back you 

00:00:04.120 --> 00:00:09.250
 see the museum of natural history 

00:00:05.380 --> 00:00:11.380
 oxford and we will go there to walk i 

00:00:09.250 --> 00:00:14.050
 tell you how you can easily enter 

00:00:11.380 --> 00:00:15.960
 oxford and how to get oxford 

00:00:14.050 --> 00:00:17.650
 half price diploma 

00:00:15.960 --> 00:00:20.619
 oxford university is 

00:00:17.650 --> 00:00:23.170
 world famous and of course many of 

00:00:20.619 --> 00:00:25.600
 you have heard in him but very few 

00:00:23.170 --> 00:00:27.060
 knows that there are two in oxford 

00:00:25.600 --> 00:00:28.820
 university 

00:00:27.060 --> 00:00:32.070
 always the university of oxford itself 

00:00:28.820 --> 00:00:32.790
 investors oxford oxford brooks and 

00:00:32.070 --> 00:00:35.340
 mercy 

00:00:32.790 --> 00:00:39.430
 offspring never set has a centuries-old 

00:00:35.340 --> 00:00:42.850
 history and here worked Einstein 

00:00:39.430 --> 00:00:43.890
 spiders and he sphere2 or together it 

00:00:42.850 --> 00:00:47.790
 recently 

00:00:43.890 --> 00:00:51.070
 converted from technique to university i 

00:00:47.790 --> 00:00:54.660
 would say oxford brookes 70 

00:00:51.070 --> 00:00:58.030
 just using tops polish name and 

00:00:54.660 --> 00:01:01.629
 many use this principle 

00:00:58.030 --> 00:01:04.449
 there are many benefits first education 

00:01:01.629 --> 00:01:05.979
 worth two or even 3 times cheaper than 

00:01:04.449 --> 00:01:08.740
 at Oxford University 

00:01:05.979 --> 00:01:12.250
 besides, it's much easier to go there 

00:01:08.740 --> 00:01:15.310
 enroll people just get a diploma in 

00:01:12.250 --> 00:01:17.110
 Russian university and basically later 

00:01:15.310 --> 00:01:17.740
 they tell everyone that they studied in 

00:01:17.110 --> 00:01:20.399
 oxford 

00:01:17.740 --> 00:01:23.830
 so how can you guess outside 

00:01:20.399 --> 00:01:25.780
 oxford and certainly not england nobody 

00:01:23.830 --> 00:01:26.680
 knows that there are actually two 

00:01:25.780 --> 00:01:29.649
 university 

00:01:26.680 --> 00:01:31.149
 so you can well i would say on 

00:01:29.649 --> 00:01:32.820
 freebie get 

00:01:31.149 --> 00:01:35.799
 acting warm 

00:01:32.820 --> 00:01:37.899
 it's worth noting that Prussians 

00:01:35.799 --> 00:01:40.140
 university there is no graduate school there only 

00:01:37.899 --> 00:01:44.130
 bachelors and masters 

00:01:40.140 --> 00:01:46.710
 but there are also positive ones 

00:01:44.130 --> 00:01:48.659
 moments for example in oxford 

00:01:46.710 --> 00:01:52.020
 university is completely absent 

00:01:48.659 --> 00:01:54.990
 profession of architect and suddenly you July 8 

00:01:52.020 --> 00:01:58.500
 This specialty is also available in 

00:01:54.990 --> 00:02:02.790
 Russian university is much larger 

00:01:58.500 --> 00:02:04.650
 the emphasis is on art and somehow 

00:02:02.790 --> 00:02:07.710
 specialties dedicated 

00:02:04.650 --> 00:02:09.750
 media earth ie for example if you 

00:02:07.710 --> 00:02:12.360
 want to learn from the operator 

00:02:09.750 --> 00:02:15.480
 then in oxford you are not such an education 

00:02:12.360 --> 00:02:18.959
 you can get but the bars 

00:02:15.480 --> 00:02:21.390
 university yes of course it happened 

00:02:18.959 --> 00:02:23.240
 that in hands on the network is big enough 

00:02:21.390 --> 00:02:25.490
 kazar and diaspora 

00:02:23.240 --> 00:02:29.300
 so if you are people from this country 

00:02:25.490 --> 00:02:34.030
 close then go straight to study there 

00:02:29.300 --> 00:02:37.500
 and another moment like that 

00:02:34.030 --> 00:02:40.110
 I think student life there 

00:02:37.500 --> 00:02:41.970
 incomparably more fun than with 

00:02:40.110 --> 00:02:45.240
 university well, probably just because 

00:02:41.970 --> 00:02:47.940
 that there are less nerds and people know how 

00:02:45.240 --> 00:02:50.640
 have fun and have fun in general if 

00:02:47.940 --> 00:02:52.260
 you are committed to getting everything 

00:02:50.640 --> 00:02:55.230
 bachelor that's cheese grandfathers 

00:02:52.260 --> 00:02:57.240
 but you lack money a little 

00:02:55.230 --> 00:02:59.430
 maybe you're not quite sure what 

00:02:57.240 --> 00:03:01.770
 be able to save the moat with just brought my grandfather 

00:02:59.430 --> 00:03:03.030
 then I would advise you to go to oxford 

00:03:01.770 --> 00:03:05.610
 brookes university 

00:03:03.030 --> 00:03:07.860
 and you will have a boxing diploma you 

00:03:05.610 --> 00:03:10.200
 want to know more news or some 

00:03:07.860 --> 00:03:13.520
 Tricks and life's like that 

00:03:10.200 --> 00:03:13.520
 subscribe to the channel 

00:03:15.220 --> 00:03:22.780
 now we are in the museum 

00:03:18.290 --> 00:03:22.780
 Oxford natural history 

00:03:23.090 --> 00:03:29.810
 Here's the collection was probably going to a couple 

00:03:25.700 --> 00:03:33.670
 centuries when the British who are not 

00:03:29.810 --> 00:03:38.200
 mastered thats all that anime went there 

00:03:33.670 --> 00:03:38.200
 some unusual animals 

00:03:38.910 --> 00:03:43.220
 everyone collected were taken to his island 

00:03:44.410 --> 00:03:49.260
 but also since there is one in oxford 

00:03:46.510 --> 00:03:49.260
 from the best universities 

00:03:49.420 --> 00:03:57.810
 it is clear that the researchers carried their 

00:03:53.860 --> 00:03:57.810
 collections are here 

00:04:01.930 --> 00:04:05.939
 so here you can safely touch 

00:04:06.140 --> 00:04:09.160
 scarecrow background 

00:04:15.900 --> 00:04:22.150
 decided huge skeleton and it is not 

00:04:18.720 --> 00:04:24.680
 copy the real skeleton and 

00:04:22.150 --> 00:04:28.820
 insert yourself in a tiny town 

00:04:24.680 --> 00:04:32.600
 oxford 70,000 us they lie here 

00:04:28.820 --> 00:04:36.490
 170000 population here such 

00:04:32.600 --> 00:04:36.490
 incredible museum exists 

00:04:44.880 --> 00:04:51.500
 by the way this is how strange it is 

00:04:47.640 --> 00:04:51.500
 it looked like a skeleton and elephants 

00:04:51.610 --> 00:04:55.770
 see how strange their skulls look 

00:04:56.169 --> 00:05:00.759
 as if there was one big eye 

00:04:57.819 --> 00:05:03.580
 in the middle here is considered to be a legend 

00:05:00.759 --> 00:05:06.159
 cyclops appeared just when people 

00:05:03.580 --> 00:05:10.150
 began to find such a skull they believed 

00:05:06.159 --> 00:05:12.960
 what is this some one-eyed giant this 

00:05:10.150 --> 00:05:12.960
 just an elephant 

00:05:23.900 --> 00:05:28.419
 and here is a stuffed animal from South America 

00:05:37.249 --> 00:05:40.779
 here we have astral 

00:05:41.030 --> 00:05:46.330
 kangaroo 

00:05:43.310 --> 00:05:46.330
 and wombats they 

00:05:47.120 --> 00:05:50.919
 such a giant guinea pig 

00:05:53.360 --> 00:05:59.080
 where are the parts of the big whales 

00:06:06.540 --> 00:06:13.910
 principle for kids is just perfect 

00:06:09.000 --> 00:06:13.910
 a place to explore the animals of the world 

00:06:24.710 --> 00:06:34.599
 here is about sushki 

00:06:29.689 --> 00:06:34.599
 After all, even written specially touch 

00:06:37.030 --> 00:06:43.200
 so that children can safely touch 

00:06:40.260 --> 00:06:47.480
 and learn Deresh 

00:06:43.200 --> 00:06:47.480
 it’s a pity of course that you don’t regret anyone 

00:06:53.960 --> 00:06:59.770
 I remember that dinosaur 

00:06:56.840 --> 00:06:59.770
 from cartoons 

00:07:05.620 --> 00:07:09.000
 and here we have triceraptors
