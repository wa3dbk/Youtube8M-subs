00:00:00.610 --> 00:00:08.050
 hello everyone in this video I'm going to 

00:00:03.610 --> 00:00:11.349
 teach how to use a weapon or play 

00:00:08.050 --> 00:00:15.249
 in a competition or in a battle 

00:00:11.349 --> 00:00:16.600
 bakugan said this we started the concept 

00:00:15.249 --> 00:00:18.910
 basic no weaponry that is a 

00:00:16.600 --> 00:00:23.650
 gadget like a bakugan trap that you 

00:00:18.910 --> 00:00:27.100
 allows that allows you to add points 

00:00:23.650 --> 00:00:28.960
 like everything to your a cuban obviously these 

00:00:27.100 --> 00:00:35.140
 two young people come to you with letters like 

00:00:28.960 --> 00:00:37.000
 the traps so you can have more 

00:00:35.140 --> 00:00:39.150
 power and you know how to use them because it's not 

00:00:37.000 --> 00:00:41.890
 only to have it already you raised a thousand points 

00:00:39.150 --> 00:00:43.600
 you have to have the letters is not 

00:00:41.890 --> 00:00:45.220
 mandatory to have them in the competition 

00:00:43.600 --> 00:00:47.649
 because it feels like it would fill with cheating cards 

00:00:45.220 --> 00:00:51.610
 and of letters you are of moments that you do not 

00:00:47.649 --> 00:00:55.000
 these letters are useless to me me me 

00:00:51.610 --> 00:00:56.950
 two letters came 

00:00:55.000 --> 00:00:58.690
 some have English and some English 

00:00:56.950 --> 00:01:02.350
 languages ​​and the others come others like 

00:00:58.690 --> 00:01:05.280
 we can see this moment the jet 

00:01:02.350 --> 00:01:08.049
 it's time for boats can be 

00:01:05.280 --> 00:01:10.869
 as I already recognize my at the moment I know 

00:01:08.049 --> 00:01:14.950
 I do not need the letters to know how 

00:01:10.869 --> 00:01:17.320
 you play with this let's say we already the 

00:01:14.950 --> 00:01:19.680
 learning is I do not need this for 

00:01:17.320 --> 00:01:21.930
 example if it is 

00:01:19.680 --> 00:01:24.390
 this moment and I put it in dragon if it is 

00:01:21.930 --> 00:01:26.240
 for me and bakugan 

00:01:24.390 --> 00:01:29.540
 can 

00:01:26.240 --> 00:01:32.990
 I have to have two coins if they fall in 

00:01:29.540 --> 00:01:36.680
 face is 80 is for each side are 80 or 

00:01:32.990 --> 00:01:38.540
 I would add 160 if they look for them in 

00:01:36.680 --> 00:01:39.979
 but it's a good luck because 

00:01:38.540 --> 00:01:42.000
 maybe the two of me fall seriously between 

00:01:39.979 --> 00:01:45.840
 herd names 

00:01:42.000 --> 00:01:49.470
 or also if vanessa takes away all the 

00:01:45.840 --> 00:01:51.479
 skill letters to my opponent a 

00:01:49.470 --> 00:01:54.330
 armament bakugan 

00:01:51.479 --> 00:01:57.270
 can be used if your bakugan is not 

00:01:54.330 --> 00:02:01.110
 invasions bundles ex allies for example 

00:01:57.270 --> 00:02:05.790
 if I have this bakugan I am in the 

00:02:01.110 --> 00:02:07.979
 competition but I can not use it 

00:02:05.790 --> 00:02:10.229
 I have this weapon if we say that already 

00:02:07.979 --> 00:02:13.170
 balance I do it is not and it was lost yes 

00:02:10.229 --> 00:02:15.959
 and I'm doing as you already do of all 

00:02:13.170 --> 00:02:18.150
 my used and then it is already like a 

00:02:15.959 --> 00:02:21.090
 new cycle with the moment if all that 

00:02:18.150 --> 00:02:23.940
 I do it is very simple I have here I 'm going to 

00:02:21.090 --> 00:02:28.530
 Cuba yes and let's say that my 

00:02:23.940 --> 00:02:30.650
 opponent imagine that an opponent here 

00:02:28.530 --> 00:02:32.760
 let's say that this is me the black 

00:02:30.650 --> 00:02:34.709
 obviously in this case I could not use 

00:02:32.760 --> 00:02:38.040
 my trap or Cuba my weapon which 

00:02:34.709 --> 00:02:41.160
 why then because obviously the dark 

00:02:38.040 --> 00:02:42.600
 ozz unpublished that is partners or acknowledgment 

00:02:41.160 --> 00:02:45.380
 because in my letter he tells me that he has to 

00:02:42.600 --> 00:02:47.520
 be of those two then what do I do 

00:02:45.380 --> 00:02:50.400
 let's imagine that this one becomes fiver 

00:02:47.520 --> 00:02:52.200
 solar or has put I put my the moment of 

00:02:50.400 --> 00:02:54.970
 cuban here is just a matter of 

00:02:52.200 --> 00:02:57.490
 put it because you can not do 

00:02:54.970 --> 00:03:00.160
 and it is as if my friend playing 

00:02:57.490 --> 00:03:02.130
 I had one but now it does not matter 

00:03:00.160 --> 00:03:04.310
 now why 

00:03:02.130 --> 00:03:06.770
 what happens 

00:03:04.310 --> 00:03:09.910
 yes a good time sir the armament 

00:03:06.770 --> 00:03:09.910
 can not be reused 

00:03:10.490 --> 00:03:15.160
 it's like the time which is passed to your stack 

00:03:13.070 --> 00:03:17.020
 of obviously used 

00:03:15.160 --> 00:03:21.460
 the at the moment is not like the traps 

00:03:17.020 --> 00:03:22.080
 bakugan which is 11 this can be one or 

00:03:21.460 --> 00:03:26.170
 two 

00:03:22.080 --> 00:03:29.740
 let's say this poetry or people or acts 

00:03:26.170 --> 00:03:32.350
 so if I do not play that thing, it serves me 

00:03:29.740 --> 00:03:35.140
 although this is so and if I remember it is 

00:03:32.350 --> 00:03:36.850
 for books it's good for me but if I say 

00:03:35.140 --> 00:03:39.010
 I have a lot of walking if I have this 

00:03:36.850 --> 00:03:42.100
 moment that only serves to see if 

00:03:39.010 --> 00:03:45.040
 for acknowledgment from this no longer serves me is 

00:03:42.100 --> 00:03:47.650
 that obviously does not work for me because 

00:03:45.040 --> 00:03:49.300
 for certain things as they have note already 

00:03:47.650 --> 00:03:51.820
 they were very simple I do not need 

00:03:49.300 --> 00:03:53.640
 explain it is almost the same as a to 

00:03:51.820 --> 00:03:56.610
 a trap with 

00:03:53.640 --> 00:04:00.209
 I here right now I am in my battle 

00:03:56.610 --> 00:04:04.830
 current here I have it half thrown to cuban 

00:04:00.209 --> 00:04:08.220
 and it fell there and then my opponent 

00:04:04.830 --> 00:04:12.710
 also that ready ready fish 

00:04:08.220 --> 00:04:12.710
 only if I am already losing my battle 

00:04:13.450 --> 00:04:19.030
 I go for good let's say example because 

00:04:16.180 --> 00:04:21.160
 obviously not missing me, let's say what 

00:04:19.030 --> 00:04:24.610
 I do so, he threw me Cuban go, he brought me 

00:04:21.160 --> 00:04:25.630
 moment when almost all the bars without 

00:04:24.610 --> 00:04:27.940
 is going to be the scores have 

00:04:25.630 --> 00:04:31.090
 modifications like this one from here let's say 

00:04:27.940 --> 00:04:33.790
 this dragon today the modification of it is 

00:04:31.090 --> 00:04:36.600
 that I have to download these two so that 

00:04:33.790 --> 00:04:38.580
 you can and put it at the moment 

00:04:36.600 --> 00:04:41.430
 then that something then well simply 

00:04:38.580 --> 00:04:44.550
 I put it and if I'm a boy, it's something that 

00:04:41.430 --> 00:04:46.260
 I do not take anything, I do not add anything and I 

00:04:44.550 --> 00:04:49.020
 he removed all I can all the letters 

00:04:46.260 --> 00:04:51.270
 of skill to my opponent then in this 

00:04:49.020 --> 00:04:55.200
 case threw my two coins came out 160 

00:04:51.270 --> 00:04:57.380
 the good and ended up winning and that's 

00:04:55.200 --> 00:04:57.380
 good 

00:04:57.420 --> 00:05:01.500
 and this would be the whole tutorial of how 

00:04:59.790 --> 00:05:04.860
 as we know it is very simple because 

00:05:01.500 --> 00:05:06.900
 it's almost like a kind of trap like 

00:05:04.860 --> 00:05:09.000
 this video is so short a kind of 

00:05:06.900 --> 00:05:11.330
 trap or play your stack is not used 

00:05:09.000 --> 00:05:14.960
 you can have more than one obviously 

00:05:11.330 --> 00:05:17.449
 also if I left something sorry but 

00:05:14.960 --> 00:05:23.930
 we can look for all these rules as 

00:05:17.449 --> 00:05:26.590
 I said before www.palm.com in hold play it 

00:05:23.930 --> 00:05:26.590
 they go to the script 

00:05:26.750 --> 00:05:31.970
 how to use an increase when you are in 

00:05:28.910 --> 00:05:33.860
 English that's right, I remember that 

00:05:31.970 --> 00:05:36.500
 is in English then they will have to 

00:05:33.860 --> 00:05:38.990
 translate the good and this would be all the 

00:05:36.500 --> 00:05:41.270
 video of how to play 

00:05:38.990 --> 00:05:45.320
 Bakugan is how to use an armament to 

00:05:41.270 --> 00:05:47.750
 play and if it would be everything I hope it will 

00:05:45.320 --> 00:05:52.330
 liked this video subscribe is like 

00:05:47.750 --> 00:05:52.330
 and well we'll see each other again
