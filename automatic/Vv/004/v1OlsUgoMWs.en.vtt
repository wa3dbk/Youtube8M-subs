00:05:44.710 --> 00:05:46.590 
I definitely picked up a backup of that
especially<00:05:45.340> because<00:05:45.490> mine's<00:05:45.730> running<00:05:46.090> solo

00:05:46.590 --> 00:05:46.600 
especially because mine's running solo

00:05:46.600 --> 00:05:49.530 
especially because mine's running solo

little<00:05:49.900> one<00:05:51.210> which<00:05:52.210> is<00:05:52.420> the<00:05:53.190> dramatic<00:05:54.840> nope
