00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.830
 hello I'm catalina alba and now I 

00:00:02.040 --> 00:00:07.140
 I bring a different accompaniment there 

00:00:04.830 --> 00:00:09.330
 an ingredient that I'm sure that 

00:00:07.140 --> 00:00:11.179
 many of you have bought or have 

00:00:09.330 --> 00:00:14.309
 consumed but they prepare it in a 

00:00:11.179 --> 00:00:16.379
 or we prepare it in a similar way almost 

00:00:14.309 --> 00:00:18.480
 it's always about the peas and 

00:00:16.379 --> 00:00:21.119
 carrots as well I dare 

00:00:18.480 --> 00:00:24.480
 use this ingredient of constancy 

00:00:21.119 --> 00:00:26.849
 to make some more pea dates with 

00:00:24.480 --> 00:00:29.970
 carrot accompanied by a honey sauce 

00:00:26.849 --> 00:00:33.180
 mustard then let's see what we need 

00:00:29.970 --> 00:00:34.950
 in this preparation peas and carrots 

00:00:33.180 --> 00:00:36.690
 the constancy that come minced 

00:00:34.950 --> 00:00:39.420
 ready to consume save us 

00:00:36.690 --> 00:00:41.790
 a lot of time and work in salsa ni 

00:00:39.420 --> 00:00:45.739
 the mustard with this sauce we are going to 

00:00:41.790 --> 00:00:45.739
 accompany our flower pots 

00:00:46.640 --> 00:00:51.870
 web 

00:00:49.350 --> 00:00:53.980
 I gave him about four or five spoonfuls 

00:00:51.870 --> 00:00:58.100
 milk 

00:00:53.980 --> 00:01:01.850
 half a cup of wheat flour 

00:00:58.100 --> 00:01:04.409
 oil for frying the pots 

00:01:01.850 --> 00:01:07.469
 Pepper 

00:01:04.409 --> 00:01:10.829
 and go to taste then the first thing that 

00:01:07.469 --> 00:01:14.990
 I'm going to do is open the can of peas 

00:01:10.829 --> 00:01:18.079
 and carrots ready 

00:01:14.990 --> 00:01:19.700
 here, the liquid has run off, we are not going 

00:01:18.079 --> 00:01:22.520
 to use the whole can we are going to use the 

00:01:19.700 --> 00:01:25.820
 half in this preparation we put it in 

00:01:22.520 --> 00:01:29.830
 a container where we can mix with 

00:01:25.820 --> 00:01:32.850
 total comfort let's add 

00:01:29.830 --> 00:01:32.850
 wheat flour 

00:01:34.990 --> 00:01:40.920
 pepper to taste 

00:01:37.290 --> 00:01:45.170
 salt to taste approximately I put 

00:01:40.920 --> 00:01:45.170
 half a teaspoon of salt the egg 

00:01:48.100 --> 00:01:58.020
 and we're going to mix everything very well with the 

00:01:51.130 --> 00:02:00.490
 help of a spoon milk 54 spoons 

00:01:58.020 --> 00:02:03.250
 do not add one because I want 

00:02:00.490 --> 00:02:05.500
 see how much moisture is missing from this 

00:02:03.250 --> 00:02:08.039
 mixture lacks a little bit so 

00:02:05.500 --> 00:02:10.950
 I want to go squeezing her 

00:02:08.039 --> 00:02:14.519
 I want it to be wet but not too 

00:02:10.950 --> 00:02:18.480
 I put two tablespoons of milk in this 

00:02:14.519 --> 00:02:20.659
 moment and I think I can put it to a 

00:02:18.480 --> 00:02:20.659
 plus 

00:02:20.780 --> 00:02:28.080
 very good is this is 

00:02:24.990 --> 00:02:29.060
 the texture with which the 

00:02:28.080 --> 00:02:30.830
 same 

00:02:29.060 --> 00:02:34.310
 here I have a pan that I've already 

00:02:30.830 --> 00:02:37.450
 heated previously we are going to put a 

00:02:34.310 --> 00:02:40.760
 little oil covering the surface 

00:02:37.450 --> 00:02:43.370
 the oil is already hot that means 

00:02:40.760 --> 00:02:47.440
 that we can start putting spoonfuls 

00:02:43.370 --> 00:02:47.440
 of the mixture in it 

00:02:52.760 --> 00:02:57.500
 and we're going to let them brown very well in 

00:02:55.700 --> 00:03:00.349
 the bottom part to give you the 

00:02:57.500 --> 00:03:03.409
 back so let's start giving it 

00:03:00.349 --> 00:03:05.120
 the return to the carrot specks and 

00:03:03.409 --> 00:03:07.569
 peas that are very nice 

00:03:05.120 --> 00:03:07.569
 golden 

00:03:10.270 --> 00:03:14.710
 they're golden brown so I'm going to 

00:03:12.400 --> 00:03:17.620
 remove them from the pan and I'll 

00:03:14.710 --> 00:03:20.700
 put on paper to absorb the 

00:03:17.620 --> 00:03:20.700
 excess fat 

00:03:24.480 --> 00:03:27.379
 ready 

00:03:32.850 --> 00:03:36.620
 over here 

00:03:34.250 --> 00:03:39.500
 As I told you, they are accompanied by a 

00:03:36.620 --> 00:03:42.290
 incredible sauce a combination of 

00:03:39.500 --> 00:03:46.680
 taste of mustard with very rich honey 

00:03:42.290 --> 00:03:49.870
 let's put a little bit above 

00:03:46.680 --> 00:03:52.510
 and we are going to decorate here 

00:03:49.870 --> 00:03:54.489
 and here we have the pea pots with 

00:03:52.510 --> 00:03:56.709
 carrot the constancy accompanied by 

00:03:54.489 --> 00:03:58.810
 mini mustard sauce great for 

00:03:56.709 --> 00:04:01.480
 accompany any dish even as 

00:03:58.810 --> 00:04:03.250
 a very nutritious glass to the mouth if not 

00:04:01.480 --> 00:04:04.989
