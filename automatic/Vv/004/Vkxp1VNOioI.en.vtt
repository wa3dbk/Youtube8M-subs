00:00:15.600 --> 00:00:18.810
 hello to all this is the nail art of 

00:00:17.100 --> 00:00:20.190
 today it is in collaboration with another 

00:00:18.810 --> 00:00:22.320
 girl making videos on youtube that 

00:00:20.190 --> 00:00:24.029
 many of you will know that I find 

00:00:22.320 --> 00:00:27.210
 really very good with the nail art 

00:00:24.029 --> 00:00:27.779
 or ros of 90 or rossella ciao 

00:00:27.210 --> 00:00:28.710
 Dear 

00:00:27.779 --> 00:00:29.910
 I'm happy to do this 

00:00:28.710 --> 00:00:31.830
 collaboration with her because I am 

00:00:29.910 --> 00:00:33.330
 happy for once to change into 

00:00:31.830 --> 00:00:35.010
 sense of making a collaboration with 

00:00:33.330 --> 00:00:37.590
 another girl who does nail art then 

00:00:35.010 --> 00:00:39.930
 it really excites me how 

00:00:37.590 --> 00:00:42.930
 keep we had chosen and gave up 

00:00:39.930 --> 00:00:45.510
 decided to make a minimal nail art 

00:00:42.930 --> 00:00:49.320
 so something portable anyway 

00:00:45.510 --> 00:00:51.150
 I went for a black French manicure 

00:00:49.320 --> 00:00:54.449
 I like black france a lot on 

00:00:51.150 --> 00:00:57.000
 all the nails with these can fuchsia and 

00:00:54.449 --> 00:01:02.159
 white and only on the lunar I made a 

00:00:57.000 --> 00:01:03.870
 corset that opens is not difficult to 

00:01:02.159 --> 00:01:05.970
 make this here just like 

00:01:03.870 --> 00:01:08.729
 I said I decided to make it 

00:01:05.970 --> 00:01:10.380
 minimal because I like it that way 

00:01:08.729 --> 00:01:12.090
 obviously it can be realized on all the 

00:01:10.380 --> 00:01:13.560
 nails and corset can be closed 

00:01:12.090 --> 00:01:16.380
 you can do it open you can do it more 

00:01:13.560 --> 00:01:18.360
 more loose you can put less 

00:01:16.380 --> 00:01:20.280
 laces I like the laces so I do 

00:01:18.360 --> 00:01:23.759
 I put so many because it gives me the idea 

00:01:20.280 --> 00:01:25.500
 of the laces that tighten the corset 

00:01:23.759 --> 00:01:28.469
 behind the back not all of them 

00:01:25.500 --> 00:01:31.829
 ribbons and so then here is the reason 

00:01:28.469 --> 00:01:33.780
 of the many passages of tapes in short 

00:01:31.829 --> 00:01:35.789
 however with this it is all I send a 

00:01:33.780 --> 00:01:37.979
 bacterium standard rossenna a norm bacione 

00:01:35.789 --> 00:01:40.340
 all of you and leave you tutorials 

00:01:37.979 --> 00:01:40.340
 Hello 

00:01:42.130 --> 00:01:45.950
 start one always by applying a base 

00:01:44.390 --> 00:01:49.150
 half this span of goals in stand at 

00:01:45.950 --> 00:01:49.150
 various functions 

00:01:51.940 --> 00:01:56.320
 over this base they extend pink 

00:01:53.770 --> 00:01:57.880
 pastel this one at 200 of Cuba this 

00:01:56.320 --> 00:02:02.670
 it is one of those classic colors that yes 

00:01:57.880 --> 00:02:02.670
 find for the french manicure 

00:02:04.409 --> 00:02:08.530
 this point with a black enamel and I'm in 

00:02:06.759 --> 00:02:10.360
 using the 2 75 of whom hatching from 

00:02:08.530 --> 00:02:12.160
 make a france never closed all 

00:02:10.360 --> 00:02:14.920
 nails less than on the ring finger 

00:02:12.160 --> 00:02:17.590
 I clean the brush well I take some 

00:02:14.920 --> 00:02:20.950
 of nail polish on the hilltop to one side 

00:02:17.590 --> 00:02:22.300
 and shooting towards the center 

00:02:20.950 --> 00:02:23.890
 did not go down so as to 

00:02:22.300 --> 00:02:27.220
 leave some body free 

00:02:23.890 --> 00:02:29.560
 precisely May pulls down and 

00:02:27.220 --> 00:02:31.269
 I join and continue to make me this form 

00:02:29.560 --> 00:02:33.099
 then this first draft on all the 

00:02:31.269 --> 00:02:34.959
 geese I take a brush from the blow 

00:02:33.099 --> 00:02:37.569
 thin court I heard this 

00:02:34.959 --> 00:02:39.220
 piece of plastic on which to put 

00:02:37.569 --> 00:02:41.920
 a few drops of nail polish always back 

00:02:39.220 --> 00:02:46.360
 because we have to go to perfect the 

00:02:41.920 --> 00:02:50.280
 so our french I go precisely to give 

00:02:46.360 --> 00:02:50.280
 the form that my france desires 

00:03:00.170 --> 00:03:03.709
 here I have made the point on all the 

00:03:01.880 --> 00:03:04.370
 nails less this were rare and on 

00:03:03.709 --> 00:03:06.080
 inch 

00:03:04.370 --> 00:03:07.700
 I 'll take my black nail polish from 

00:03:06.080 --> 00:03:10.069
 go over my bezel so as to 

00:03:07.700 --> 00:03:14.020
 go to cover there are streaks 

00:03:10.069 --> 00:03:14.020
 left by the thin brush 

00:03:21.420 --> 00:03:26.980
 but to clean the corners where I have 

00:03:24.580 --> 00:03:28.600
 soiled the skin with the enamel with a 

00:03:26.980 --> 00:03:35.050
 vein will want the enamels here in di 

00:03:28.600 --> 00:03:37.420
 old if it is not already bad to avoid 

00:03:35.050 --> 00:03:39.130
 maybe rubbing to go and touch 

00:03:37.420 --> 00:03:40.840
 I still keep the enamel I still have 

00:03:39.130 --> 00:03:42.220
 simply leaning with the tip e 

00:03:40.840 --> 00:03:44.140
 then throw it so that it does 

00:03:42.220 --> 00:03:47.050
 then it begins to melt a little 

00:03:44.140 --> 00:03:48.760
 therefore I avoid sudden movements in short 

00:03:47.050 --> 00:03:52.120
 that could ruin yours too 

00:03:48.760 --> 00:03:54.340
 top coat work with essence gel effect e 

00:03:52.120 --> 00:03:56.650
 quick drying this way 

00:03:54.340 --> 00:03:59.260
 nail polish will dry first and go 

00:03:56.650 --> 00:04:01.330
 in the meantime to camouflage that 

00:03:59.260 --> 00:04:03.160
 small height difference that has come to 

00:04:01.330 --> 00:04:04.900
 create a free body between the mural body 

00:04:03.160 --> 00:04:06.459
 have some acrylic paint on it 

00:04:04.900 --> 00:04:08.320
 takes a small brush from the tip 

00:04:06.459 --> 00:04:12.790
 quite short and thin this is here 

00:04:08.320 --> 00:04:15.130
 one of the da vinci brushes is 3.0 

00:04:12.790 --> 00:04:17.500
 I'm not even going to dilute it for now 

00:04:15.130 --> 00:04:19.660
 because I don't need it diluted because I have to 

00:04:17.500 --> 00:04:23.080
 I want to shape my corset 

00:04:19.660 --> 00:04:25.530
 make open as you pass the glass 

00:04:23.080 --> 00:04:25.530
 with water 

00:04:40.270 --> 00:04:44.860
 ok this thing could be done 

00:04:43.310 --> 00:04:47.590
 with enamel, however, acrylic painting 

00:04:44.860 --> 00:04:50.540
 it allows to 

00:04:47.590 --> 00:04:53.150
 go and remove with water yes 

00:04:50.540 --> 00:04:54.770
 wrong so for me it is a menata in 

00:04:53.150 --> 00:04:57.500
 less harsh criticism of pink and fuchsia 

00:04:54.770 --> 00:05:01.060
 used those of crystal in the mood 

00:04:57.500 --> 00:05:01.060
 giving fuchsia first 

00:05:10.050 --> 00:05:16.470
 because here it dries us even points 

00:05:12.370 --> 00:05:16.470
 on france always in fuchsia 

00:05:17.050 --> 00:05:21.430
 I also took a bit of painting that row 

00:05:18.639 --> 00:05:23.409
 white and used this night by 

00:05:21.430 --> 00:05:26.770
 tip go him for a while because of me 

00:05:23.409 --> 00:05:29.110
 serves very thin and I go to pass it 

00:05:26.770 --> 00:05:31.860
 inside the fuchsia dots here 

00:05:29.110 --> 00:05:31.860
 sull'anulare 

00:05:36.889 --> 00:05:48.639
 I also go into this one 

00:05:44.689 --> 00:05:48.639
 dot I go with pink critical painting 

00:05:50.950 --> 00:05:55.690
 to trace these lines first 

00:05:52.450 --> 00:05:59.760
 horizontal I go to close it I do 

00:05:55.690 --> 00:05:59.760
 also crossed because I like it 

00:06:03.930 --> 00:06:10.900
 ok to still see more in the 

00:06:07.659 --> 00:06:18.400
 rose we pass the lines with a pinch of 

00:06:10.900 --> 00:06:20.169
 very diluted white acrylic paint 

00:06:18.400 --> 00:06:21.699
 it will be completely dry or 

00:06:20.169 --> 00:06:23.559
 when it becomes opaque you can 

00:06:21.699 --> 00:06:26.439
 apply over the top coat and this time 

00:06:23.559 --> 00:06:29.039
 use this here for workers not for 

00:06:26.439 --> 00:06:32.110
 some particular reason but why 

00:06:29.039 --> 00:06:33.819
 I found it again and it was still open 

00:06:32.110 --> 00:06:36.699
 then before you seen that dried 

00:06:33.819 --> 00:06:38.889
 anyway in his place I go to him in short 

00:06:36.699 --> 00:06:41.580
 use then start from the others 

00:06:38.889 --> 00:06:43.749
 nails last paper spread it over 

00:06:41.580 --> 00:06:45.849
 on ring finger, however, that is all 

00:06:43.749 --> 00:06:49.860
 I very much hope you enjoyed it and there 

00:06:45.849 --> 00:06:49.860
 I leave the photos a kiss hello
