00:00:00.979 --> 00:00:08.099
 Hello everyone, a short video on the subject 

00:00:05.300 --> 00:00:10.500
 activation of the fuel by the magnetic field 

00:00:08.099 --> 00:00:11.820
 that is, those who are interested in this topic 

00:00:10.500 --> 00:00:14.430
 wanted to try 

00:00:11.820 --> 00:00:16.650
 the fact is that in some some 

00:00:14.430 --> 00:00:18.360
 sell the type of dudyshev called 

00:00:16.650 --> 00:00:21.060
 magnetic fuel activator i.e. 

00:00:18.360 --> 00:00:22.520
 there is nothing so special there 

00:00:21.060 --> 00:00:25.860
 parse mean 

00:00:22.520 --> 00:00:28.199
 hard drives found there such 

00:00:25.860 --> 00:00:29.789
 magnets magnets are very strong i mean 

00:00:28.199 --> 00:00:33.079
 they have a gripping power 

00:00:29.789 --> 00:00:37.199
 let's say i think kilo thirty 

00:00:33.079 --> 00:00:39.229
 among themselves ie they have a case then 

00:00:37.199 --> 00:00:42.269
 have they located opposites on 

00:00:39.229 --> 00:00:43.889
 it means the magnetic field goes strictly 

00:00:42.269 --> 00:00:46.829
 perpendicular if you for example 

00:00:43.889 --> 00:00:50.639
 place the fuel wire between these 

00:00:46.829 --> 00:00:53.670
 two magnets further on you can 

00:00:50.639 --> 00:00:57.449
 for example 

00:00:53.670 --> 00:01:00.679
 so or shall we say that there are several pairs 

00:00:57.449 --> 00:01:05.100
 magnets to enhance the effect can 

00:01:00.679 --> 00:01:07.500
 poles let's change poles to 

00:01:05.100 --> 00:01:10.170
 for example, the word alternation 

00:01:07.500 --> 00:01:13.080
 maybe maybe poles 

00:01:10.170 --> 00:01:15.900
 should like the same I do not know that is 

00:01:13.080 --> 00:01:17.700
 any case you can conduct experiments 

00:01:15.900 --> 00:01:19.620
 on any car there in his 

00:01:17.700 --> 00:01:21.630
 or on the generator is very 

00:01:19.620 --> 00:01:23.310
 finally figure out whether 

00:01:21.630 --> 00:01:27.750
 a magnetic field that lights up what 

00:01:23.310 --> 00:01:29.640
 fuel on but on him on his 

00:01:27.750 --> 00:01:33.570
 characteristics there on the heat of combustion 

00:01:29.640 --> 00:01:34.770
 Energy released during his at 

00:01:33.570 --> 00:01:37.920
 fire engines internal 

00:01:34.770 --> 00:01:43.400
 combustion itself is simple and affordable 

00:01:37.920 --> 00:01:43.400
 without recourse to different 

00:01:43.730 --> 00:01:50.280
 manufacturer who tell what 

00:01:46.530 --> 00:01:52.170
 they have there some kind of super on know-how and 

00:01:50.280 --> 00:01:55.340
 so on naturally no know-how 

00:01:52.170 --> 00:01:57.570
 no there is any curve and oblique 

00:01:55.340 --> 00:02:00.470
 plastic case in which 

00:01:57.570 --> 00:02:02.670
 God forbid neodymium but most likely 

00:02:00.470 --> 00:02:05.040
 ferrite magnets are inserted for 

00:02:02.670 --> 00:02:07.530
 cheaper and all this is sold to you in 

00:02:05.040 --> 00:02:10.079
 beautiful box there for a few 

00:02:07.530 --> 00:02:12.389
 thousand rubles actually marketing nothing 

00:02:10.079 --> 00:02:13.020
 such a business is said nothing 

00:02:12.389 --> 00:02:15.450
 personal 

00:02:13.020 --> 00:02:17.550
 everyone decides for himself what he 

00:02:15.450 --> 00:02:19.410
 buy and what not just yesterday was 

00:02:17.550 --> 00:02:22.470
 the conversation is just about 

00:02:19.410 --> 00:02:24.390
 Dudyshev and I like that and I remembered and 

00:02:22.470 --> 00:02:27.120
 decided to remove this video small 

00:02:24.390 --> 00:02:29.750
 explaining yes thank you all for your attention 

00:02:27.120 --> 00:02:29.750
 happily
