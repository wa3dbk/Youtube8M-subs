00:00:00.320 --> 00:00:03.709
 more questions than answers today are 

00:00:02.600 --> 00:00:06.260
 celebrates one year of the mysterious 

00:00:03.709 --> 00:00:10.070
 disappearance of the 370 flight of 

00:00:06.260 --> 00:00:12.139
 malaysia airlines with 239 occupants 12 

00:00:10.070 --> 00:00:14.450
 months later not only have not 

00:00:12.139 --> 00:00:16.699
 found the remains of the aircraft but 

00:00:14.450 --> 00:00:19.550
 it also is uncertain about by 

00:00:16.699 --> 00:00:21.500
 what the boeing 777 disappeared from the 

00:00:19.550 --> 00:00:23.269
 radars the prime minister of australia 

00:00:21.500 --> 00:00:24.769
 country that leads the operations of 

00:00:23.269 --> 00:00:27.140
 rescue said the search for the 

00:00:24.769 --> 00:00:29.390
 aircraft will continue because he claimed 

00:00:27.140 --> 00:00:31.369
 they owe it to the relatives they 

00:00:29.390 --> 00:00:33.379
 his part does not give his arm to twist and 

00:00:31.369 --> 00:00:34.420
 they affirm that they are still waiting for the return 

00:00:33.379 --> 00:00:37.010
 of your loved ones

 felipe wood is one of the six passengers 

00:00:37.010 --> 00:00:39.829
 Australians who were traveling aboard the 

00:00:39.110 --> 00:00:42.920
 m flight 

00:00:39.829 --> 00:00:45.260
 370 of malaysia airlines last 8 of 

00:00:42.920 --> 00:00:46.969
 March disappeared from the radars 

00:00:45.260 --> 00:00:49.399
 although for many the hope of 

00:00:46.969 --> 00:00:51.859
 find the 239 occupants alive 

00:00:49.399 --> 00:00:54.109
 of the aircraft has vanished saves your 

00:00:51.859 --> 00:00:57.350
 wife is not willing to compromise on her 

00:00:54.109 --> 00:00:59.780
 longing to see again there are plenty 

00:00:57.350 --> 00:01:02.059
 of people who have told me we are going now 

00:00:59.780 --> 00:01:04.070
 he is not going to acknowledge it and 

00:01:02.059 --> 00:01:06.380
 just go ahead with your life 

00:01:04.070 --> 00:01:07.340
 but I'm not willing to do that 

00:01:06.380 --> 00:01:10.070
 because there is no more 

00:01:07.340 --> 00:01:12.740
 and really I can not continue until 

00:01:10.070 --> 00:01:14.509
 they do not have it and it is that the relatives 

00:01:12.740 --> 00:01:17.000
 they still have no answers of what 

00:01:14.509 --> 00:01:19.790
 He passed with his loved ones 

00:01:17.000 --> 00:01:21.830
 in perth australia from annika weeks no 

00:01:19.790 --> 00:01:24.440
 He knows how to explain to his children because 

00:01:21.830 --> 00:01:27.229
 after a year his father has not arrived yet 

00:01:24.440 --> 00:01:30.350
 home the reason even she does not know the 

00:01:27.229 --> 00:01:32.240
 I really just try to be there 

00:01:30.350 --> 00:01:34.700
 when they are crying and begging for 

00:01:32.240 --> 00:01:36.619
 dad come back and I tell them he's always 

00:01:34.700 --> 00:01:39.770
 in our heart it is always with 

00:01:36.619 --> 00:01:41.720
 us 12 months later the company 

00:01:39.770 --> 00:01:44.360
 air broadcast on Sunday the first 

00:01:41.720 --> 00:01:46.010
 full report on flight 370 the 

00:01:44.360 --> 00:01:48.170
 report revealed that the battery of a 

00:01:46.010 --> 00:01:49.850
 radio beacon of submarine location of 

00:01:48.170 --> 00:01:51.590
 one of the black boxes had expired 

00:01:49.850 --> 00:01:54.649
 more than a year before the mysterious 

00:01:51.590 --> 00:01:56.180
 disappearance of the plane however in 

00:01:54.649 --> 00:01:58.130
 practical terms this report does not 

00:01:56.180 --> 00:02:00.770
 sheds light on what happened to the 

00:01:58.130 --> 00:02:03.560
 m flight 370 relatives of the 

00:02:00.770 --> 00:02:05.720
 occupants of the boeing 777 rated it 

00:02:03.560 --> 00:02:09.399
 as useless after all as it says 

00:02:05.720 --> 00:02:09.399
 this sign does not surrender 

00:02:09.490 --> 00:02:13.900
 I urge you to withdraw the advertisement or display 

00:02:12.280 --> 00:02:17.770
 our evidence to prove what 

00:02:13.900 --> 00:02:19.570
 it happened with the flight the boing 777 of the 

00:02:17.770 --> 00:02:22.300
 Malaysian airline that was headed to 

00:02:19.570 --> 00:02:24.850
 Kuala Lumpur to Beijing disappeared on 8 

00:02:22.300 --> 00:02:26.920
 March 2014 40 minutes after the 

00:02:24.850 --> 00:02:28.810
 take off and then the change of course in 

00:02:26.920 --> 00:02:30.700
 a deliberate action according to the experts 

00:02:28.810 --> 00:02:32.740
 the international search teams 

00:02:30.700 --> 00:02:34.120
 have not yet found the remains of the 

00:02:32.740 --> 00:02:36.550
 aircraft and hope to have tracked 

00:02:34.120 --> 00:02:38.920
 60,000 square kilometers in the ocean 

00:02:36.550 --> 00:02:42.220
 Indicate at the end of May otherwise 

00:02:38.920 --> 00:02:43.930
 they must rethink that mission 

00:02:42.220 --> 00:02:45.340
 at this time we establish contact in 

00:02:43.930 --> 00:02:47.620
 I live in buenos aires argentina with 

00:02:45.340 --> 00:02:48.910
 Guillermo + natales pilot and secretary 

00:02:47.620 --> 00:02:50.920
 of security of the pilots association 

00:02:48.910 --> 00:02:52.810
 of airlines from the Argentine sir 

00:02:50.920 --> 00:02:56.010
 Send is very good morning and thanks for 

00:02:52.810 --> 00:02:58.290
 join us on the ntn24 news 

00:02:56.010 --> 00:03:02.730
 thank you very much and good morning greetings to 

00:02:58.290 --> 00:03:06.599
 the americas to all without doubt the case 

00:03:02.730 --> 00:03:09.980
 of 370 is a case that will mark the 

00:03:06.599 --> 00:03:12.959
 history of commercial aviation 

00:03:09.980 --> 00:03:15.209
 contemporary let's say one follows 

00:03:12.959 --> 00:03:17.849
 generating doubts as it is possible that 

00:03:15.209 --> 00:03:20.849
 in the 21st century in the 21st century with 

00:03:17.849 --> 00:03:23.190
 so much technology is capable an airplane of 

00:03:20.849 --> 00:03:25.680
 the dimensions of a 777 boeing 

00:03:23.190 --> 00:03:29.050
 just disappear and one year later 

00:03:25.680 --> 00:03:31.360
 still have no trace of what happened 

00:03:29.050 --> 00:03:32.950
 Now that is the main case and 

00:03:31.360 --> 00:03:36.550
 finally we investigate accidents 

00:03:32.950 --> 00:03:38.950
 we go to the one that happened and how it happened and in 

00:03:36.550 --> 00:03:41.290
 this case we do not even have the views 

00:03:38.950 --> 00:03:43.000
 primary to establish not even 

00:03:41.290 --> 00:03:44.260
 the trajectories that the plane followed 

00:03:43.000 --> 00:03:47.800
 that is being sought today from the ocean 

00:03:44.260 --> 00:03:50.260
 Indic is a presumption based on data 

00:03:47.800 --> 00:03:52.540
 they are quite weak an interpretation 

00:03:50.260 --> 00:03:53.500
 satellite a military radar people 

00:03:52.540 --> 00:03:55.600
 except the plane that using the 

00:03:53.500 --> 00:03:57.670
 prediction of Malaya and so on not even 

00:03:55.600 --> 00:03:59.800
 we have the basic guidelines that we have 

00:03:57.670 --> 00:04:01.540
 to start investigating an accident 

00:03:59.800 --> 00:04:03.040
 you say in this century with the 

00:04:01.540 --> 00:04:05.110
 communications that there are with the 

00:04:03.040 --> 00:04:07.840
 location with everything we use at 

00:04:05.110 --> 00:04:10.510
 This newspaper is hard to want a 

00:04:07.840 --> 00:04:11.830
 thing like this can happen to happen this has 

00:04:10.510 --> 00:04:13.840
 caused that the relation of the action 

00:04:11.830 --> 00:04:16.359
 civil and international rights issued in 

00:04:13.840 --> 00:04:18.220
 these months a provision for 

00:04:16.359 --> 00:04:20.410
 which the location system of 

00:04:18.220 --> 00:04:23.950
 aircraft has to change from the 

00:04:20.410 --> 00:04:25.900
 year 2016 and the position of the plane tri that 

00:04:23.950 --> 00:04:28.180
 does at least every 15 minutes 

00:04:25.900 --> 00:04:30.280
 now I want to clarify that currently the 

00:04:28.180 --> 00:04:32.200
 Most companies have the 17th 

00:04:30.280 --> 00:04:34.090
 functioning location and the 

00:04:32.200 --> 00:04:35.139
 positions are every three minutes so 

00:04:34.090 --> 00:04:36.900
 so much 

00:04:35.139 --> 00:04:39.039
 that is, this had not happened 

00:04:36.900 --> 00:04:41.800
 with the modification that is intended 

00:04:39.039 --> 00:04:44.469
 implement I would like to ask you the 

00:04:41.800 --> 00:04:47.020
 sir more cream there are hypotheses that point 

00:04:44.469 --> 00:04:48.789
 to a collective suicide by good 

00:04:47.020 --> 00:04:50.860
 headed by the pilot others more about 

00:04:48.789 --> 00:04:54.069
 the kidnapping there is a government report 

00:04:50.860 --> 00:04:56.289
 of australia of the cdl in the area 

00:04:54.069 --> 00:04:58.539
 responsible for security that indicates that 

00:04:56.289 --> 00:05:00.669
 it could even have been that the aircraft 

00:04:58.539 --> 00:05:05.169
 will stay as well as without fuel to a 

00:05:00.669 --> 00:05:07.360
 year this type of presumptions may be 

00:05:05.169 --> 00:05:11.580
 erased and reach a key point to 

00:05:07.360 --> 00:05:11.580
 know what happened to the aircraft 

00:05:11.760 --> 00:05:18.310
 by the criminalization of both 

00:05:15.190 --> 00:05:19.870
 some passenger like the crew is 

00:05:18.310 --> 00:05:21.190
 a practically police issue of the 

00:05:19.870 --> 00:05:23.890
 police investigation not of the 

00:05:21.190 --> 00:05:25.330
 aeronautical research and it is logical 

00:05:23.890 --> 00:05:26.800
 the police authorities 

00:05:25.330 --> 00:05:29.860
 analyze and put it as a hypothesis 

00:05:26.800 --> 00:05:31.840
 dams absolutely unacceptable to 

00:05:29.860 --> 00:05:34.180
 we as researchers of 

00:05:31.840 --> 00:05:36.970
 aviation accident there are no 

00:05:34.180 --> 00:05:41.340
 minimum guidelines to establish that that 

00:05:36.970 --> 00:05:44.860
 hypothesis can generate something sustainable 

00:05:41.340 --> 00:05:46.810
 as an argument there are no arguments 

00:05:44.860 --> 00:05:48.910
 in the sense they have investigated the 

00:05:46.810 --> 00:05:51.100
 exhibition passengers prosthesis already 

00:05:48.910 --> 00:05:53.200
 discarded has spoken the Iranian passenger 

00:05:51.100 --> 00:05:55.690
 there has been talk of the suicide attempt or 

00:05:53.200 --> 00:05:58.480
 the social suicide of the crew 

00:05:55.690 --> 00:06:00.550
 of the plane and nothing has been able to have a 

00:05:58.480 --> 00:06:02.380
 sustainable trace in that aspect that the 

00:06:00.550 --> 00:06:04.750
 plane followed without fuel is 

00:06:02.380 --> 00:06:06.940
 practically sure if we assume 

00:06:04.750 --> 00:06:09.220
 the hypothesis that the plane flew towards the 

00:06:06.940 --> 00:06:10.990
 Indian Ocean as it is actually said there 

00:06:09.220 --> 00:06:13.800
 in that case if he has not run out 

00:06:10.990 --> 00:06:17.130
 fuel and would have somehow 

00:06:13.800 --> 00:06:19.660
 come to impact by water control 

00:06:17.130 --> 00:06:21.730
 what is not known could be 

00:06:19.660 --> 00:06:22.870
 there was an accident this on board can 

00:06:21.730 --> 00:06:25.390
 have a fire in the cabin 

00:06:22.870 --> 00:06:28.030
 command could have a specialization 

00:06:25.390 --> 00:06:29.350
 had caused the hypoxia by a 

00:06:28.030 --> 00:06:30.880
 problem in the procedure that 

00:06:29.350 --> 00:06:34.120
 grace in presentation house and others 

00:06:30.880 --> 00:06:35.560
 that yes that would make a comparison for 

00:06:34.120 --> 00:06:37.800
 the difficulty of establishing here a 

00:06:35.560 --> 00:06:40.780
 cause with the following that if we had 

00:06:37.800 --> 00:06:42.610
 of a still investigating a criminal act 

00:06:40.780 --> 00:06:45.130
 and we did not have at the crime scene 

00:06:42.610 --> 00:06:46.450
 we did not have the murder weapon and we 

00:06:45.130 --> 00:06:49.450
 we could do the autopsy of the corpse 

00:06:46.450 --> 00:06:50.440
 or which one with these guidelines is impossible 

00:06:49.450 --> 00:06:52.780
 to have anything that is not a 

00:06:50.440 --> 00:06:54.340
 speculation and here until it does not appear 

00:06:52.780 --> 00:06:56.650
 the black boxes that somehow is 

00:06:54.340 --> 00:06:58.420
 the autopsy of the flight we can not 

00:06:56.650 --> 00:07:00.610
 determine reliably what they are 

00:06:58.420 --> 00:07:02.190
 what were the causes and they were all 

00:07:00.610 --> 00:07:05.070
 hypothesis 

00:07:02.190 --> 00:07:06.690
 and nothing more than that we thank 

00:07:05.070 --> 00:07:08.100
 Guillermo more natalia is a pilot and 

00:07:06.690 --> 00:07:09.420
 security secretary of the association 

00:07:08.100 --> 00:07:10.740
 of airline pilots of argentina 

00:07:09.420 --> 00:07:13.830
 but now he has accompanied us in the 

00:07:10.740 --> 00:07:16.490
 informative of ntn24 happy day many 

00:07:13.830 --> 00:07:16.490
 thanks to you
