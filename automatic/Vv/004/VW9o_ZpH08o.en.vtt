00:00:05.390 --> 00:00:05.400 
I've said that before but to be honest I

00:00:05.400 --> 00:00:07.820 
I've said that before but to be honest I
wasn't<00:00:05.819> really<00:00:05.970> sure<00:00:06.390> of<00:00:06.720> how<00:00:07.049> close<00:00:07.350> I<00:00:07.560> was<00:00:07.799> I

00:00:07.820 --> 00:00:07.830 
wasn't really sure of how close I was I

00:00:07.830 --> 00:00:09.500 
wasn't really sure of how close I was I
just<00:00:08.040> was<00:00:08.340> like<00:00:08.460> we've<00:00:08.849> been<00:00:09.000> going<00:00:09.300> for<00:00:09.330> a

00:00:09.500 --> 00:00:09.510 
just was like we've been going for a

00:00:09.510 --> 00:00:10.940 
just was like we've been going for a
while<00:00:09.690> so<00:00:09.990> there's<00:00:10.139> probably<00:00:10.410> not<00:00:10.559> much<00:00:10.710> left

00:00:10.940 --> 00:00:10.950 
while so there's probably not much left

00:00:10.950 --> 00:00:13.400 
while so there's probably not much left
to<00:00:11.010> do<00:00:11.219> but<00:00:11.940> this<00:00:12.120> time<00:00:12.300> I<00:00:12.330> am<00:00:12.570> sure<00:00:12.780> I've

00:00:13.400 --> 00:00:13.410 
to do but this time I am sure I've

00:00:13.410 --> 00:00:15.560 
to do but this time I am sure I've
looked<00:00:13.679> at<00:00:13.860> quest<00:00:14.219> lists<00:00:14.519> online<00:00:14.670> and<00:00:15.210> there's

00:00:15.560 --> 00:00:15.570 
looked at quest lists online and there's

00:00:15.570 --> 00:00:17.390 
looked at quest lists online and there's
really<00:00:15.780> not<00:00:16.049> that<00:00:16.320> much<00:00:16.560> left<00:00:16.890> to<00:00:16.949> do

00:00:17.390 --> 00:00:17.400 
really not that much left to do

00:00:17.400 --> 00:00:21.429 
really not that much left to do
I'd<00:00:18.150> say<00:00:18.359> we<00:00:18.510> probably<00:00:18.539> have<00:00:19.250> another<00:00:20.250> at<00:00:20.640> most

00:00:21.429 --> 00:00:21.439 
I'd say we probably have another at most

00:00:21.439 --> 00:00:24.230 
I'd say we probably have another at most
like<00:00:22.439> one<00:00:22.890> to<00:00:23.039> two<00:00:23.070> months<00:00:23.519> which<00:00:23.910> is<00:00:23.939> only

00:00:24.230 --> 00:00:24.240 
like one to two months which is only

00:00:24.240 --> 00:00:25.970 
like one to two months which is only
like<00:00:24.449> 10<00:00:24.600> to<00:00:24.689> 20<00:00:24.960> episodes<00:00:25.350> which<00:00:25.619> is<00:00:25.740> kind<00:00:25.920> of

00:00:25.970 --> 00:00:25.980 
like 10 to 20 episodes which is kind of

00:00:25.980 --> 00:00:27.589 
like 10 to 20 episodes which is kind of
small<00:00:26.130> compared<00:00:26.789> to<00:00:26.880> how<00:00:27.210> long<00:00:27.390> we've<00:00:27.570> been

00:00:27.589 --> 00:00:27.599
