00:01:32.040 --> 00:01:32.050 
first of which is conceptual yeah

00:01:32.050 --> 00:01:34.050 
first of which is conceptual yeah
they're<00:01:32.260> like<00:01:32.409> the<00:01:32.620> idea<00:01:32.980> of<00:01:33.100> playing<00:01:33.550> Super

00:01:36.450 --> 00:01:36.460 
Monkey Ball with motion or you don't

00:01:36.460 --> 00:01:38.460 
Monkey Ball with motion or you don't
there<00:01:37.120> have<00:01:37.210> been<00:01:37.300> a<00:01:37.360> lot<00:01:37.600> of<00:01:37.630> Wii<00:01:37.870> games<00:01:38.170> that

00:01:38.460 --> 00:01:38.470 
there have been a lot of Wii games that

00:01:38.470 --> 00:01:41.310 
there have been a lot of Wii games that
actually<00:01:38.740> improve<00:01:39.580> on<00:01:39.840> traditional<00:01:40.840> control

00:01:41.310 --> 00:01:41.320 
actually improve on traditional control

00:01:41.320 --> 00:01:44.070 
actually improve on traditional control
mechanics<00:01:41.890> with<00:01:42.100> motion<00:01:42.670> and<00:01:42.790> pointing<00:01:43.390> but<00:01:44.020> a

00:01:44.070 --> 00:01:44.080 
mechanics with motion and pointing but a

00:01:44.080 --> 00:01:46.050 
mechanics with motion and pointing but a
lot<00:01:44.320> more<00:01:44.560> of<00:01:44.740> use<00:01:44.950> them<00:01:45.220> simply<00:01:45.790> for<00:01:45.970> the

00:01:46.050 --> 00:01:46.060 
lot more of use them simply for the

00:01:46.060 --> 00:01:49.440 
lot more of use them simply for the
novelty

00:01:49.440 --> 00:01:49.450 

00:01:49.450 --> 00:01:53.830 

Oh

00:01:53.830 --> 00:01:53.840 

00:01:53.840 --> 00:01:56.750 

step<00:01:54.840> and<00:01:55.020> roll<00:01:55.320> is<00:01:55.620> one<00:01:55.860> of<00:01:55.980> them<00:01:56.100> it<00:01:56.430> uses

00:01:56.750 --> 00:01:56.760 
step and roll is one of them it uses

00:01:56.760 --> 00:01:58.820 
step and roll is one of them it uses
motion<00:01:57.000> in<00:01:57.300> the<00:01:57.390> form<00:01:57.630> of<00:01:57.750> tilt<00:01:58.080> control<00:01:58.590> and

00:01:58.820 --> 00:01:58.830 
motion in the form of tilt control and

00:01:58.830 --> 00:02:01.280 
motion in the form of tilt control and
support<00:01:59.610> for<00:01:59.730> the<00:01:59.850> Wii<00:02:00.000> Balance<00:02:00.030> Board<00:02:00.570> and<00:02:00.960> as

00:02:01.280 --> 00:02:01.290 
support for the Wii Balance Board and as

00:02:01.290 --> 00:02:03.350 
support for the Wii Balance Board and as
different<00:02:01.740> as<00:02:01.800> that<00:02:01.980> may<00:02:02.130> be<00:02:02.160> it's<00:02:03.030> anything

00:02:03.350 --> 00:02:03.360 
different as that may be it's anything

00:02:03.360 --> 00:02:05.120 
different as that may be it's anything
but<00:02:03.540> an<00:02:03.870> improvement<00:02:04.320> over<00:02:04.650> the<00:02:04.980> more

00:02:05.120 --> 00:02:05.130 
but an improvement over the more

00:02:05.130 --> 00:02:07.430 
but an improvement over the more
traditional<00:02:05.880> analog<00:02:06.330> sticks<00:02:06.690> it's<00:02:07.080> slower

00:02:07.430 --> 00:02:07.440 
traditional analog sticks it's slower

00:02:07.440 --> 00:02:10.730 
traditional analog sticks it's slower
it's<00:02:08.040> less<00:02:08.340> precise<00:02:08.940> and<00:02:09.240> it's<00:02:09.960> the<00:02:10.170> epitome

00:02:10.730 --> 00:02:10.740 
it's less precise and it's the epitome

00:02:10.740 --> 00:02:13.280 
it's less precise and it's the epitome
of<00:02:10.770> a<00:02:10.979> game<00:02:11.190> that<00:02:11.430> uses<00:02:11.610> motion<00:02:12.330> just<00:02:12.990> for

00:02:13.280 --> 00:02:13.290 
of a game that uses motion just for

00:02:13.290 --> 00:02:16.370 
of a game that uses motion just for
motions<00:02:13.680> sake<00:02:14.010> but<00:02:14.880> with<00:02:15.150> that<00:02:15.330> said<00:02:15.690> it<00:02:16.080> works

00:02:16.370 --> 00:02:16.380 
motions sake but with that said it works

00:02:16.380 --> 00:02:19.340 
motions sake but with that said it works
about<00:02:16.740> as<00:02:17.040> well<00:02:17.250> as<00:02:17.670> tilt<00:02:18.000> can<00:02:18.390> work<00:02:18.690> in<00:02:18.900> fact

00:02:19.340 --> 00:02:19.350 
about as well as tilt can work in fact

00:02:19.350 --> 00:02:21.860 
about as well as tilt can work in fact
moving<00:02:19.980> your<00:02:20.370> monkey<00:02:20.850> with<00:02:21.030> motion<00:02:21.660> is

00:02:21.860 --> 00:02:21.870 
moving your monkey with motion is

00:02:21.870 --> 00:02:23.510 
moving your monkey with motion is
actually<00:02:22.590> the<00:02:22.770> least<00:02:22.980> of<00:02:23.250> the<00:02:23.310> game's

00:02:23.510 --> 00:02:23.520 
actually the least of the game's

00:02:26.210 --> 00:02:26.220

of uniquely themed worlds and the

many bananas as you can and reach the

many bananas as you can and reach the

core<00:02:59.580> concept<00:03:00.180> has<00:03:00.390> always<00:03:00.540> been<00:03:00.840> fun<00:03:01.200> and<00:03:01.350> at

00:03:01.910 --> 00:03:01.920 
core concept has always been fun and at

00:03:01.920 --> 00:03:05.630 
core concept has always been fun and at
least<00:03:02.160> in<00:03:02.459> flashes<00:03:03.060> it<00:03:03.300> is<00:03:03.780> here<00:03:04.110> too<00:03:04.489> but<00:03:05.489> you

00:03:05.630 --> 00:03:05.640 
least in flashes it is here too but you

00:03:05.640 --> 00:03:07.520 
least in flashes it is here too but you
know<00:03:05.730> even<00:03:06.209> if<00:03:06.300> you<00:03:06.330> can<00:03:06.540> get<00:03:06.660> past<00:03:06.930> the<00:03:07.170> motion

00:03:07.520 --> 00:03:07.530 
know even if you can get past the motion

00:03:07.530 --> 00:03:09.680 
know even if you can get past the motion
controls<00:03:08.010> there<00:03:08.250> are<00:03:08.340> even<00:03:08.670> more<00:03:08.940> obstacles

00:03:09.680 --> 00:03:09.690 
controls there are even more obstacles

00:03:09.690 --> 00:03:12.199 
controls there are even more obstacles
to<00:03:09.750> overcome<00:03:09.870> with<00:03:10.830> step<00:03:11.220> and<00:03:11.430> roll<00:03:11.580> and<00:03:11.880> for

00:03:12.199 --> 00:03:12.209 
to overcome with step and roll and for

00:03:12.209 --> 00:03:14.300 
to overcome with step and roll and for
some<00:03:12.390> reason<00:03:12.810> Sega<00:03:13.110> removed<00:03:13.590> the<00:03:13.800> ability<00:03:14.280> to

00:03:14.300 --> 00:03:14.310 
some reason Sega removed the ability to

00:03:14.310 --> 00:03:16.520 
some reason Sega removed the ability to
jump<00:03:14.730> an<00:03:15.000> addition<00:03:15.630> that<00:03:15.660> worked<00:03:15.989> great<00:03:16.500> in

00:03:16.520 --> 00:03:16.530 
jump an addition that worked great in

00:03:16.530 --> 00:03:19.400 
jump an addition that worked great in
banana<00:03:17.280> blitz<00:03:17.580> and<00:03:17.910> you<00:03:18.480> know<00:03:18.600> as<00:03:18.870> dull<00:03:19.200> as

00:03:19.400 --> 00:03:19.410 
banana blitz and you know as dull as

00:03:23.630 --> 00:03:23.640 
doesn't make any sense to cut the total

00:03:23.640 --> 00:03:26.000 
doesn't make any sense to cut the total
from<00:03:23.820> banana<00:03:24.180> blitz<00:03:24.480> in<00:03:24.720> half<00:03:24.989> but<00:03:25.680> that's

00:03:26.000 --> 00:03:26.010 
from banana blitz in half but that's

00:03:26.010 --> 00:03:36.880 
from banana blitz in half but that's
what<00:03:26.340> step<00:03:26.640> and<00:03:26.820> roll<00:03:26.970> does

00:03:36.880 --> 00:03:36.890 

00:03:36.890 --> 00:03:39.790 

it's<00:03:37.700> not<00:03:37.850> just<00:03:38.090> about<00:03:38.240> content<00:03:39.020> either<00:03:39.260> the

00:03:39.790 --> 00:03:39.800 
it's not just about content either the

00:03:39.800 --> 00:03:41.860 
it's not just about content either the
levels<00:03:40.160> just<00:03:40.610> aren't<00:03:40.850> as<00:03:40.940> much<00:03:41.150> fun<00:03:41.510> as<00:03:41.690> other

00:03:41.860 --> 00:03:41.870 
levels just aren't as much fun as other

00:03:41.870 --> 00:03:44.560 
levels just aren't as much fun as other
monkey<00:03:42.290> ball<00:03:42.470> games<00:03:42.770> and<00:03:43.010> frankly<00:03:43.910> playing

00:03:44.560 --> 00:03:44.570 
monkey ball games and frankly playing

00:03:44.570 --> 00:03:46.210 
monkey ball games and frankly playing
with<00:03:44.750> the<00:03:44.870> balance<00:03:45.290> board<00:03:45.560> with<00:03:45.770> any<00:03:45.920> degree

with the balance board with any degree

00:03:46.220 --> 00:03:49.000 
with the balance board with any degree
of<00:03:46.430> accuracy<00:03:46.970> is<00:03:47.420> almost<00:03:48.050> impossible<00:03:48.830> and

00:03:49.000 --> 00:03:49.010 
of accuracy is almost impossible and

00:03:49.010 --> 00:03:51.040 
of accuracy is almost impossible and
actually<00:03:49.430> it<00:03:49.580> kind<00:03:50.090> of<00:03:50.210> feels<00:03:50.390> like<00:03:50.510> banana

00:03:51.040 --> 00:03:51.050 
actually it kind of feels like banana

00:03:51.050 --> 00:03:52.540 
actually it kind of feels like banana
blitz<00:03:51.350> should<00:03:51.620> have<00:03:51.710> been<00:03:51.890> the<00:03:52.010> second<00:03:52.400> game

00:03:52.540 --> 00:03:52.550 
blitz should have been the second game

00:03:52.550 --> 00:03:55.000 
blitz should have been the second game
as<00:03:52.730> if<00:03:53.150> the<00:03:53.390> shortcomings<00:03:54.080> of<00:03:54.230> step<00:03:54.560> and<00:03:54.800> roll

00:03:55.000 --> 00:03:55.010 
as if the shortcomings of step and roll

00:03:55.010 --> 00:03:57.220 
as if the shortcomings of step and roll
would<00:03:55.520> have<00:03:55.640> been<00:03:55.910> lessons<00:03:56.540> learned<00:03:56.870> in<00:03:57.140> a

00:03:57.220 --> 00:03:57.230 
would have been lessons learned in a

sequel

sequel

00:03:57.890 --> 00:04:00.700 
sequel
oh<00:03:58.060> sure<00:03:59.060> this<00:03:59.270> one<00:03:59.450> adds<00:03:59.690> some<00:03:59.930> co-op<00:04:00.350> but

00:04:00.700 --> 00:04:00.710 
oh sure this one adds some co-op but

00:04:00.710 --> 00:04:03.070 
oh sure this one adds some co-op but
otherwise<00:04:01.130> it's<00:04:01.910> mostly<00:04:02.240> subtractions

00:04:03.070 --> 00:04:03.080 
otherwise it's mostly subtractions

00:04:03.080 --> 00:04:05.020 
otherwise it's mostly subtractions
across<00:04:03.410> the<00:04:03.650> board<00:04:03.890> and<00:04:04.070> for<00:04:04.430> the<00:04:04.520> franchise

00:04:05.020 --> 00:04:05.030 
across the board and for the franchise

00:04:05.030 --> 00:04:07.330 
across the board and for the franchise
to<00:04:05.240> actually<00:04:05.750> regress<00:04:06.410> the<00:04:06.440> second<00:04:07.160> time

00:04:07.330 --> 00:04:07.340 
to actually regress the second time

00:04:07.340 --> 00:04:09.340 
to actually regress the second time
around<00:04:07.370> it's<00:04:08.060> pretty<00:04:08.270> unfortunate<00:04:08.780> for<00:04:09.200> Wii

00:04:09.340 --> 00:04:09.350 
around it's pretty unfortunate for Wii

00:04:09.350 --> 00:04:11.680 
around it's pretty unfortunate for Wii
owners<00:04:09.470> oh<00:04:09.890> look<00:04:10.790> I<00:04:10.910> don't<00:04:11.000> know<00:04:11.209> if<00:04:11.240> Sega

00:04:11.680 --> 00:04:11.690 
owners oh look I don't know if Sega

00:04:11.690 --> 00:04:13.600 
owners oh look I don't know if Sega
actually<00:04:12.290> believed<00:04:12.740> stepping<00:04:13.370> onto<00:04:13.520> a

00:04:13.600 --> 00:04:13.610 
actually believed stepping onto a

00:04:13.610 --> 00:04:15.490 
actually believed stepping onto a
balance<00:04:14.090> board<00:04:14.330> would<00:04:14.570> make<00:04:14.750> the<00:04:14.930> Monkey<00:04:15.350> Ball

00:04:15.490 --> 00:04:15.500 
balance board would make the Monkey Ball

00:04:15.500 --> 00:04:19.060 
balance board would make the Monkey Ball
series<00:04:15.980> better<00:04:16.310> but<00:04:17.000> as<00:04:17.299> it<00:04:17.540> is<00:04:17.690> step<00:04:18.560> and<00:04:18.799> roll

00:04:19.060 --> 00:04:19.070 
series better but as it is step and roll

00:04:19.070 --> 00:04:27.590 
series better but as it is step and roll
is<00:04:19.400> a<00:04:19.430> game<00:04:19.730> you'll<00:04:19.910> want<00:04:20.120> to<00:04:20.209> step<00:04:20.570> off

00:04:27.590 --> 00:04:27.600
