why<00:00:14.130> is<00:00:14.190> tire<00:00:14.519> pressure<00:00:14.790> important<00:00:15.360> a

00:00:15.760 --> 00:00:15.770 
why is tire pressure important a

00:00:15.770 --> 00:00:18.560 
why is tire pressure important a
properly<00:00:16.770> inflated<00:00:17.250> tire<00:00:17.550> is<00:00:17.699> very<00:00:18.000> important

properly inflated tire is very important

00:00:18.570 --> 00:00:21.140 
properly inflated tire is very important
for<00:00:19.080> a<00:00:19.109> few<00:00:19.199> reasons<00:00:19.470> number<00:00:20.039> one<00:00:20.490> it<00:00:20.789> gets<00:00:20.970> you

00:00:21.140 --> 00:00:21.150 
for a few reasons number one it gets you

00:00:21.150 --> 00:00:23.630 
for a few reasons number one it gets you
better<00:00:21.270> gas<00:00:21.570> mileage<00:00:22.160> secondly<00:00:23.160> if<00:00:23.369> it's

00:00:23.630 --> 00:00:23.640 
better gas mileage secondly if it's

00:00:23.640 --> 00:00:26.390 
better gas mileage secondly if it's
under<00:00:24.029> inflated<00:00:24.359> or<00:00:24.660> over<00:00:25.080> inflated<00:00:25.590> you<00:00:26.279> can

00:00:26.390 --> 00:00:26.400 
under inflated or over inflated you can

00:00:26.400 --> 00:00:27.650 
under inflated or over inflated you can
have<00:00:26.519> a<00:00:26.580> blowout<00:00:26.849> which<00:00:27.150> can<00:00:27.300> be<00:00:27.359> very

00:01:24.620 --> 00:01:24.630 
like this one here should have at least

00:01:24.630 --> 00:01:29.090 
like this one here should have at least
40<00:01:25.460> psi<00:01:26.460> now<00:01:27.420> you're<00:01:27.930> asking<00:01:28.200> yourself<00:01:28.590> how<00:01:29.040> do

00:01:29.090 --> 00:01:29.100 
40 psi now you're asking yourself how do

00:01:29.100 --> 00:01:31.040 
40 psi now you're asking yourself how do
I<00:01:29.220> know<00:01:29.310> how<00:01:29.580> much<00:01:29.760> psi<00:01:30.330> to<00:01:30.390> put<00:01:30.720> in<00:01:30.810> here<00:01:31.020> I

00:01:31.040 --> 00:01:31.050 
I know how much psi to put in here I

00:01:31.050 --> 00:01:33.650 
I know how much psi to put in here I
don't<00:01:31.140> know<00:01:31.380> how<00:01:31.710> much<00:01:31.860> air<00:01:32.160> you<00:01:32.340> look<00:01:33.270> here

00:01:33.650 --> 00:01:33.660 
don't know how much air you look here

00:01:33.660 --> 00:01:38.120 
don't know how much air you look here
and<00:01:33.840> it'll<00:01:34.110> say<00:01:34.350> maximum<00:01:35.190> pressure<00:01:35.810> 44<00:01:36.810> psi<00:01:37.140> so

00:01:38.120 --> 00:01:38.130 
and it'll say maximum pressure 44 psi so

00:01:38.130 --> 00:01:41.030 
and it'll say maximum pressure 44 psi so
that<00:01:38.310> means<00:01:38.580> you<00:01:38.820> want<00:01:39.060> to<00:01:39.229> have<00:01:40.229> at<00:01:40.380> least<00:01:40.410> 40

00:01:41.030 --> 00:01:41.040 
that means you want to have at least 40

00:01:41.040 --> 00:01:43.969 
that means you want to have at least 40
psi<00:01:41.580> in<00:01:41.760> this<00:01:41.910> tire<00:01:42.119> if<00:01:42.330> not<00:01:42.660> 44<00:01:43.290> you<00:01:43.770> never

00:01:43.969 --> 00:01:43.979 
psi in this tire if not 44 you never

00:01:43.979 --> 00:01:46.850 
psi in this tire if not 44 you never
want<00:01:44.250> to<00:01:44.280> go<00:01:44.400> higher<00:01:44.670> than<00:01:44.970> 44<00:01:45.600> because<00:01:46.470> it

00:01:46.850 --> 00:01:46.860 
want to go higher than 44 because it

00:01:46.860 --> 00:01:49.219 
want to go higher than 44 because it
could<00:01:47.130> explode<00:01:47.550> especially<00:01:48.450> after<00:01:48.900> driving

00:01:49.219 --> 00:01:49.229
