00:00:02.770 --> 00:00:05.460
 and 

00:00:30.550 --> 00:00:35.470
 little by little he was waking up he opened the 

00:00:33.340 --> 00:00:37.750
 eyes and what he saw was a landscape 

00:00:35.470 --> 00:00:40.030
 devastated made an effort to 

00:00:37.750 --> 00:00:42.760
 getting up he felt sore and he 

00:00:40.030 --> 00:00:44.379
 it was hard to recover the memory all to his 

00:00:42.760 --> 00:00:46.690
 around it was destroyed and it 

00:00:44.379 --> 00:00:49.629
 I found alone in the middle of that without 

00:00:46.690 --> 00:00:52.000
 know very well why or maybe in 

00:00:49.629 --> 00:00:54.159
 actually I was not so alone as 

00:00:52.000 --> 00:00:56.470
 he suddenly thought he remembered why he was 

00:00:54.159 --> 00:00:58.780
 there was a mission I had to destroy 

00:00:56.470 --> 00:01:00.220
 that place and he had already done it with 

00:00:58.780 --> 00:01:02.470
 that did not count was with the enemies 

00:01:00.220 --> 00:01:05.229
 they survived the explosion but damn 

00:01:02.470 --> 00:01:07.930
 they were still there and they were trying 

00:01:05.229 --> 00:01:09.700
 killing me was a suicide mission would have 

00:01:07.930 --> 00:01:12.190
 lucky if I could get out of there alive 

00:01:09.700 --> 00:01:14.350
 could only run to hide ask 

00:01:12.190 --> 00:01:16.840
 help and pray for them to arrive before 

00:01:14.350 --> 00:01:19.450
 that the guilt was dead 

00:01:16.840 --> 00:01:21.369
 negligent captain sent him alone to 

00:01:19.450 --> 00:01:23.619
 charge an entire enemy base but as 

00:01:21.369 --> 00:01:25.390
 They could think that would be fine by 

00:01:23.619 --> 00:01:27.550
 finally managed to take cover to do 

00:01:25.390 --> 00:01:31.289
 a call was going to get him out of the 

00:01:27.550 --> 00:01:31.289
 that they should never have sent 

00:01:48.140 --> 00:01:51.920

00:01:50.540 --> 00:01:53.830

00:02:08.709 --> 00:02:12.130

00:02:10.450 --> 00:02:14.350

 is happening you do not see any support where 

00:02:16.030 --> 00:02:19.209
 are the helicopters I'm sorry but I 

00:02:17.740 --> 00:02:20.560
 it is impossible to send you any kind of 

00:02:19.209 --> 00:02:22.569
 support until you get a run of 

00:02:20.560 --> 00:02:24.610
 low almost casualties but what kind of 

00:02:22.569 --> 00:02:26.080
 computed is is getting bad you have 

00:02:24.610 --> 00:02:29.010
 that save you we have no other option 

00:02:26.080 --> 00:02:30.720

00:03:28.030 --> 00:03:32.560
 and that's how after this tortuous 

00:03:30.069 --> 00:03:36.010
 adventure everything ended up going well and 

00:03:32.560 --> 00:03:38.020
 solstice he managed to save himself 

00:03:36.010 --> 00:03:39.700
 you believe it, not what, you're right 

00:03:38.020 --> 00:03:40.630
 because these stories never end 

00:03:39.700 --> 00:03:42.520
 also as it seems 

00:03:40.630 --> 00:03:44.800
 so you want to know what happened from 

00:03:42.520 --> 00:03:46.239
 truth has come to your position 

00:03:44.800 --> 00:03:49.060

00:03:46.239 --> 00:03:50.800

00:03:52.330 --> 00:03:56.290

00:03:54.040 --> 00:03:57.910
 giant stone and I hope you have not 

00:03:56.290 --> 00:03:59.980
