00:00:05.920 --> 00:00:08.920 

to<00:00:06.920> make<00:00:07.070> it<00:00:07.220> easier<00:00:07.580> to<00:00:07.820> roll<00:00:08.030> out<00:00:08.300> it<00:00:08.690> just

00:00:08.920 --> 00:00:08.930 
to make it easier to roll out it just

00:00:08.930 --> 00:00:12.970 
to make it easier to roll out it just
better<00:00:09.200> just<00:00:09.500> cut<00:00:09.800> a<00:00:09.830> thin<00:00:10.309> slab<00:00:10.670> of<00:00:11.000> this<00:00:11.980> and

00:00:12.970 --> 00:00:12.980 
better just cut a thin slab of this and

00:00:12.980 --> 00:00:15.740 
better just cut a thin slab of this and
then<00:00:13.100> put<00:00:13.309> on<00:00:13.400> the<00:00:13.430> chopper

00:00:15.740 --> 00:00:15.750 

00:00:15.750 --> 00:00:17.480 

i<00:00:16.110> floured<00:00:16.530> the<00:00:16.620> chopping<00:00:16.860> board<00:00:17.010> slightly

00:00:17.480 --> 00:00:17.490 
i floured the chopping board slightly

00:00:17.490 --> 00:00:21.440 
i floured the chopping board slightly
and<00:00:17.760> the<00:00:17.940> rolling<00:00:18.270> pin<00:00:18.480> so<00:00:18.810> that<00:00:20.030> it<00:00:21.030> doesn't

00:00:21.440 --> 00:00:21.450 
and the rolling pin so that it doesn't

00:00:21.450 --> 00:00:22.240 
and the rolling pin so that it doesn't
stick<00:00:21.600> to<00:00:21.840> it

00:00:22.240 --> 00:00:22.250 
stick to it

00:00:22.250 --> 00:00:24.890 
stick to it
so<00:00:23.250> you<00:00:23.340> just<00:00:23.490> roll<00:00:23.730> this<00:00:23.910> out<00:00:24.119> to<00:00:24.330> the<00:00:24.510> desired

00:00:24.890 --> 00:00:24.900 
so you just roll this out to the desired

00:00:24.900 --> 00:00:26.859 
so you just roll this out to the desired
thickness

00:00:26.859 --> 00:00:26.869 
thickness

00:00:26.869 --> 00:00:29.150 
thickness
yeah<00:00:27.869> it's<00:00:28.050> not<00:00:28.200> very<00:00:28.260> thick<00:00:28.680> it's<00:00:29.010> like

00:00:29.150 --> 00:00:29.160 
yeah it's not very thick it's like

00:00:29.160 --> 00:00:33.140 
yeah it's not very thick it's like
roughly<00:00:29.520> um<00:00:30.470> two<00:00:31.470> millimeters<00:00:32.040> thick<00:00:32.790> and

00:00:33.140 --> 00:00:33.150 
roughly um two millimeters thick and

00:00:33.150 --> 00:00:38.270 
roughly um two millimeters thick and
then<00:00:33.810> you<00:00:33.870> just<00:00:34.430> fix<00:00:35.430> it<00:00:36.740> this<00:00:37.740> is<00:00:37.920> roughly

00:00:38.270 --> 00:00:38.280 
then you just fix it this is roughly

00:00:38.280 --> 00:00:43.100 
then you just fix it this is roughly
young<00:00:40.850> one<00:00:41.850> centimeter<00:00:42.300> thick<00:00:42.600> by<00:00:42.780> a<00:00:42.810> Kobe

00:00:43.100 --> 00:00:43.110 
young one centimeter thick by a Kobe

00:00:43.110 --> 00:00:46.220 
young one centimeter thick by a Kobe
sticker<00:00:43.470> it<00:00:43.590> has<00:00:43.800> a<00:00:43.829> big<00:00:44.190> role<00:00:44.430> in<00:00:44.460> it<00:00:45.140> so<00:00:46.140> you

00:00:46.220 --> 00:00:46.230 
sticker it has a big role in it so you

00:00:46.230 --> 00:00:48.349 
sticker it has a big role in it so you
just<00:00:46.410> slice<00:00:46.680> it<00:00:46.710> when<00:00:47.640> you<00:00:47.910> cut<00:00:48.149> it<00:00:48.270> into

00:00:48.349 --> 00:00:48.359 
just slice it when you cut it into

00:00:48.359 --> 00:00:50.990 
just slice it when you cut it into
smaller<00:00:48.690> pieces<00:00:48.780> as<00:00:49.260> well<00:00:49.489> okay<00:00:50.489> so<00:00:50.550> this<00:00:50.879> is

00:00:50.990 --> 00:00:51.000 
smaller pieces as well okay so this is

00:00:51.000 --> 00:00:51.650 
smaller pieces as well okay so this is
how<00:00:51.149> you<00:00:51.210> cut<00:00:51.480> it

00:00:51.650 --> 00:00:51.660 
how you cut it

00:00:51.660 --> 00:00:54.470 
how you cut it
I<00:00:51.899> floured<00:00:52.800> this<00:00:53.219> tree<00:00:53.519> as<00:00:53.640> well<00:00:53.850> so<00:00:54.059> that<00:00:54.239> it

00:00:54.470 --> 00:00:54.480 
I floured this tree as well so that it

00:00:54.480 --> 00:00:55.220 
I floured this tree as well so that it
won't<00:00:54.660> stick<00:00:54.750> to<00:00:55.019> it

00:00:55.220 --> 00:00:55.230 
won't stick to it

00:00:55.230 --> 00:00:57.560 
won't stick to it
I'm<00:00:56.039> currently<00:00:56.340> quite<00:00:56.699> small<00:00:57.149> just<00:00:57.180> like

00:00:57.560 --> 00:00:57.570 
I'm currently quite small just like

00:00:57.570 --> 00:01:01.970 
I'm currently quite small just like
roughly<00:01:00.199> half<00:01:01.199> a<00:01:01.320> centimeter<00:01:01.769> two<00:01:01.949> centimeter

00:01:01.970 --> 00:01:01.980 
roughly half a centimeter two centimeter

00:01:01.980 --> 00:01:06.530 
roughly half a centimeter two centimeter
thick<00:01:03.230> thick<00:01:04.230> slices<00:01:05.360> obviously<00:01:06.360> some<00:01:06.480> people

00:01:06.530 --> 00:01:06.540 
thick thick slices obviously some people

00:01:06.540 --> 00:01:08.540 
thick thick slices obviously some people
may<00:01:06.810> want<00:01:06.840> it<00:01:07.110> to<00:01:07.440> be<00:01:07.530> thicker<00:01:07.800> by<00:01:08.400> way<00:01:08.490> you

00:01:08.540 --> 00:01:08.550 
may want it to be thicker by way you

00:01:08.550 --> 00:01:11.210 
may want it to be thicker by way you
catering<00:01:09.030> for<00:01:09.180> so<00:01:09.360> many<00:01:09.510> people<00:01:09.920> maybe<00:01:10.920> cut

00:01:11.210 --> 00:01:11.220 
catering for so many people maybe cut

00:01:11.220 --> 00:01:13.280 
catering for so many people maybe cut
this<00:01:11.370> small<00:01:11.700> it<00:01:12.360> makes<00:01:12.630> the<00:01:12.690> proportions<00:01:13.170> look

00:01:13.280 --> 00:01:13.290 
this small it makes the proportions look

00:01:13.290 --> 00:01:16.220 
this small it makes the proportions look
much<00:01:13.470> bigger<00:01:13.650> and<00:01:14.580> it's<00:01:14.730> preserves<00:01:15.630> well<00:01:15.900> and

00:01:16.220 --> 00:01:16.230 
much bigger and it's preserves well and

00:01:16.230 --> 00:01:18.500 
much bigger and it's preserves well and
also<00:01:16.470> it<00:01:16.800> the<00:01:17.010> frying<00:01:17.250> time<00:01:17.610> is<00:01:17.760> not<00:01:17.910> as<00:01:18.060> long

00:01:18.500 --> 00:01:18.510 
also it the frying time is not as long

00:01:18.510 --> 00:01:21.200 
also it the frying time is not as long
as<00:01:18.750> well<00:01:19.490> that's<00:01:20.490> what<00:01:20.640> you<00:01:20.729> do<00:01:20.909> so<00:01:20.939> we're

00:01:21.200 --> 00:01:21.210 
as well that's what you do so we're

00:01:21.210 --> 00:01:22.460 
as well that's what you do so we're
gonna<00:01:21.329> just<00:01:21.540> do<00:01:21.630> the<00:01:21.689> same<00:01:21.930> process<00:01:22.170> as<00:01:22.439> the

00:01:22.460 --> 00:01:22.470 
gonna just do the same process as the

00:01:22.470 --> 00:01:26.990 
gonna just do the same process as the
remaining<00:01:23.180> dough<00:01:25.220> okay<00:01:26.220> so<00:01:26.280> whilst<00:01:26.790> you're

00:01:26.990 --> 00:01:27.000 
remaining dough okay so whilst you're

00:01:27.000 --> 00:01:32.749 
remaining dough okay so whilst you're
I'm<00:01:28.040> preparing<00:01:29.040> the<00:01:30.170> chip<00:01:31.170> such<00:01:31.439> a<00:01:31.470> more<00:01:31.770> like

00:01:32.749 --> 00:01:32.759 
I'm preparing the chip such a more like

00:01:32.759 --> 00:01:34.609 
I'm preparing the chip such a more like
a<00:01:32.909> rolling<00:01:33.360> out<00:01:33.509> and<00:01:33.689> cutting<00:01:33.869> it<00:01:34.020> out<00:01:34.140> it's

00:01:34.609 --> 00:01:34.619 
a rolling out and cutting it out it's

00:01:34.619 --> 00:01:37.280 
a rolling out and cutting it out it's
good<00:01:34.979> just<00:01:35.220> a<00:01:35.340> good<00:01:35.520> time<00:01:35.700> to<00:01:35.909> now<00:01:36.079> heat<00:01:37.079> up<00:01:37.200> the

00:01:37.280 --> 00:01:37.290 
good just a good time to now heat up the

00:01:37.290 --> 00:01:40.670 
good just a good time to now heat up the
oil<00:01:37.350> as<00:01:37.680> well<00:01:37.890> I<00:01:38.450> took<00:01:39.450> another<00:01:39.990> music<00:01:40.350> riots

00:01:40.670 --> 00:01:40.680 
oil as well I took another music riots

00:01:40.680 --> 00:01:43.789 
oil as well I took another music riots
you<00:01:41.579> chopped<00:01:41.909> up<00:01:42.149> if<00:01:42.869> the<00:01:43.020> smaller<00:01:43.320> piece<00:01:43.590> is

00:01:43.789 --> 00:01:43.799 
you chopped up if the smaller piece is

00:01:43.799 --> 00:01:45.200 
you chopped up if the smaller piece is
also<00:01:44.100> that<00:01:44.250> it<00:01:44.369> looks<00:01:44.549> nice<00:01:44.759> present

00:01:45.200 --> 00:01:45.210 
also that it looks nice present

00:01:45.210 --> 00:01:49.069 
also that it looks nice present
presentation-wise<00:01:47.390> okay<00:01:48.390> so<00:01:48.450> I'm<00:01:48.659> just<00:01:48.719> using

00:01:49.069 --> 00:01:49.079 
presentation-wise okay so I'm just using

00:01:49.079 --> 00:01:51.319 
presentation-wise okay so I'm just using
some<00:01:49.229> vegetable<00:01:49.860> oil<00:01:50.100> so<00:01:50.610> I<00:01:50.670> saw<00:01:50.880> the<00:01:50.939> bowl<00:01:51.210> of

00:01:51.319 --> 00:01:51.329 
some vegetable oil so I saw the bowl of

00:01:51.329 --> 00:01:53.350 
some vegetable oil so I saw the bowl of
vegetable<00:01:51.750> oil<00:01:51.840> and<00:01:51.899> I've<00:01:52.049> turned<00:01:52.229> it<00:01:52.439> on<00:01:52.469> and

00:01:53.350 --> 00:01:53.360 
vegetable oil and I've turned it on and

00:01:53.360 --> 00:01:55.429 
vegetable oil and I've turned it on and
to<00:01:54.360> test<00:01:54.570> of<00:01:54.689> the<00:01:54.750> oils<00:01:55.079> at<00:01:55.200> the<00:01:55.290> right

00:01:55.429 --> 00:01:55.439 
to test of the oils at the right

00:01:55.439 --> 00:01:58.690 
to test of the oils at the right
temperature<00:01:56.070> you<00:01:56.310> need<00:01:57.180> to<00:01:57.329> put<00:01:57.600> a<00:01:57.630> bit<00:01:57.899> of<00:01:57.930> the

00:01:58.690 --> 00:01:58.700 
temperature you need to put a bit of the

00:01:58.700 --> 00:02:02.300 
temperature you need to put a bit of the
prepared<00:01:59.700> chips<00:02:00.799> chips<00:02:01.799> like<00:02:02.009> one<00:02:02.159> or<00:02:02.280> two

00:02:02.300 --> 00:02:02.310 
prepared chips chips like one or two

00:02:02.310 --> 00:02:04.520 
prepared chips chips like one or two
into<00:02:02.640> it<00:02:02.969> when<00:02:03.329> you<00:02:03.420> put<00:02:03.630> it<00:02:03.750> in<00:02:03.930> and<00:02:04.140> it<00:02:04.320> rises

00:02:04.520 --> 00:02:04.530 
into it when you put it in and it rises

00:02:04.530 --> 00:02:05.270 
into it when you put it in and it rises
quickly

00:02:05.270 --> 00:02:05.280 
quickly

00:02:05.280 --> 00:02:06.679 
quickly
that<00:02:05.880> means<00:02:06.060> the<00:02:06.119> oil<00:02:06.270> is<00:02:06.420> at<00:02:06.509> the<00:02:06.600> right

00:02:06.679 --> 00:02:06.689 
that means the oil is at the right

00:02:06.689 --> 00:02:09.020 
that means the oil is at the right
temperature<00:02:06.750> so<00:02:07.619> once<00:02:08.310> I<00:02:08.430> have<00:02:08.670> here<00:02:08.910> these

00:02:09.020 --> 00:02:09.030 
temperature so once I have here these

00:02:09.030 --> 00:02:10.880 
temperature so once I have here these
three<00:02:09.360> that<00:02:09.509> I<00:02:09.539> have<00:02:09.810> here<00:02:10.080> if<00:02:10.229> it<00:02:10.380> didn't<00:02:10.740> rise

00:02:10.880 --> 00:02:10.890 
three that I have here if it didn't rise

00:02:10.890 --> 00:02:16.070 
three that I have here if it didn't rise

00:02:17.690 --> 00:02:17.700 
the oil is at the right temperature now

00:02:17.700 --> 00:02:19.930 
the oil is at the right temperature now
so

00:02:19.930 --> 00:02:19.940 
so

00:02:19.940 --> 00:02:22.900 
so
I'm<00:02:20.420> going<00:02:20.750> to<00:02:21.260> like<00:02:21.380> I<00:02:21.590> could<00:02:21.800> I<00:02:21.950> put<00:02:22.250> in<00:02:22.700> any

00:02:24.670 --> 00:02:24.680 
rules up for quickly so the oils the

00:02:24.680 --> 00:02:25.780 
rules up for quickly so the oils the
right<00:02:24.830> temperatures<00:02:25.070> I'm<00:02:25.370> going<00:02:25.490> to<00:02:25.550> add<00:02:25.640> the

00:02:25.780 --> 00:02:25.790 
right temperatures I'm going to add the

00:02:25.790 --> 00:02:26.800 
right temperatures I'm going to add the
remain<00:02:26.090> into<00:02:26.420> it

00:02:26.800 --> 00:02:26.810 
remain into it

00:02:26.810 --> 00:02:29.200 
remain into it

like<00:02:29.570> hot<00:02:29.840> oil<00:02:32.620> they<00:02:33.620> don't<00:02:33.950> add<00:02:34.100> too<00:02:34.370> much<00:02:34.400> to

00:02:34.930 --> 00:02:34.940 
like hot oil they don't add too much to

00:02:34.940 --> 00:02:37.060 
like hot oil they don't add too much to
it<00:02:35.150> because<00:02:35.480> you<00:02:35.540> don't<00:02:35.630> want<00:02:35.870> it<00:02:36.050> to<00:02:36.260> take<00:02:36.920> too

00:02:37.060 --> 00:02:37.070 
it because you don't want it to take too

00:02:37.070 --> 00:02:42.750 
it because you don't want it to take too
long<00:02:37.190> to<00:02:37.370> cook<00:02:37.520> and<00:02:37.730> stick<00:02:37.880> up<00:02:38.000> a<00:02:38.090> lot<00:02:38.210> of<00:02:38.240> oil

00:02:42.750 --> 00:02:42.760 

00:02:42.760 --> 00:02:45.730 

keep<00:02:43.760> it<00:02:43.880> at<00:02:43.970> the<00:02:44.060> same<00:02:44.090> temperature<00:02:44.660> until<00:02:45.530> it

00:02:45.730 --> 00:02:45.740 
keep it at the same temperature until it

00:02:45.740 --> 00:02:47.680 
keep it at the same temperature until it
starts<00:02:46.040> to<00:02:46.100> turn<00:02:46.370> slightly<00:02:46.880> brown<00:02:47.300> then<00:02:47.540> you

00:02:47.680 --> 00:02:47.690 
starts to turn slightly brown then you

00:02:47.690 --> 00:02:55.260 
starts to turn slightly brown then you
know<00:02:47.930> the<00:02:48.110> temperature<00:02:48.650> so<00:02:49.370> that<00:02:49.400> it<00:02:49.520> doesn't

00:02:55.260 --> 00:02:55.270 

00:02:55.270 --> 00:02:57.760 

we<00:02:56.270> need<00:02:56.420> to<00:02:56.480> stare<00:02:56.780> it<00:02:56.900> up<00:02:57.020> as<00:02:57.200> well<00:02:57.440> so<00:02:57.620> that

00:02:57.760 --> 00:02:57.770 
we need to stare it up as well so that

00:02:57.770 --> 00:03:02.010 
we need to stare it up as well so that
it<00:02:57.920> country<00:02:58.430> goes<00:02:59.180> into<00:02:59.420> the<00:02:59.510> individual

00:03:02.010 --> 00:03:02.020 
it country goes into the individual

00:03:02.020 --> 00:03:05.280 
it country goes into the individual
chips<00:03:03.020> rather<00:03:03.380> than<00:03:03.650> something<00:03:04.190> together

00:03:05.280 --> 00:03:05.290 
chips rather than something together

00:03:05.290 --> 00:03:08.260 
chips rather than something together
okay<00:03:06.320> they<00:03:06.980> just<00:03:07.190> tend<00:03:07.430> it<00:03:07.550> a<00:03:07.670> little<00:03:07.880> bit<00:03:08.030> now

00:03:08.260 --> 00:03:08.270 
okay they just tend it a little bit now

00:03:18.700 --> 00:03:18.710 
staring it it's forming up the

00:03:18.710 --> 00:03:22.840 
staring it it's forming up the
individual<00:03:20.650> nice<00:03:21.650> as<00:03:21.890> well<00:03:22.010> again<00:03:22.310> for<00:03:22.550> coming

three<00:04:06.610> to<00:04:06.790> six<00:04:07.000> months<00:04:07.500> you<00:04:08.500> know<00:04:08.620> in<00:04:08.739> an

00:04:08.820 --> 00:04:08.830 
three to six months you know in an

00:04:08.830 --> 00:04:13.910 
three to six months you know in an
airtight<00:04:08.980> container<00:04:10.890> but<00:04:11.890> if<00:04:12.040> it's<00:04:12.190> too<00:04:12.489> light

00:04:13.910 --> 00:04:13.920 
airtight container but if it's too light

00:04:13.920 --> 00:04:16.170 
airtight container but if it's too light
that<00:04:14.920> one<00:04:15.040> doesn't<00:04:15.190> like<00:04:15.459> that<00:04:15.700> that<00:04:15.940> won't

00:04:16.170 --> 00:04:16.180

00:04:20.130 --> 00:04:20.140 
so obviously don't have it too dark oh

00:04:20.140 --> 00:04:21.420 
so obviously don't have it too dark oh
that's<00:04:20.350> just<00:04:20.560> burnt<00:04:20.829> and<00:04:21.040> that's<00:04:21.160> gonna<00:04:21.280> be

00:04:21.420 --> 00:04:21.430 
that's just burnt and that's gonna be

00:04:21.430 --> 00:04:24.720 
that's just burnt and that's gonna be
too<00:04:21.609> difficult<00:04:22.060> to<00:04:22.210> chew<00:04:23.130> yeah<00:04:24.130> even<00:04:24.520> if<00:04:24.640> I

00:04:24.720 --> 00:04:24.730 
too difficult to chew yeah even if I

00:04:24.730 --> 00:04:26.880 
too difficult to chew yeah even if I
took<00:04:24.790> it<00:04:25.060> out<00:04:25.240> and<00:04:25.690> it's<00:04:26.169> actually<00:04:26.650> still

00:04:26.880 --> 00:04:26.890 
took it out and it's actually still

00:04:26.890 --> 00:04:30.080 
took it out and it's actually still
darkening<00:04:27.490> slightly<00:04:28.260> so<00:04:29.260> that's<00:04:29.470> the<00:04:29.620> chips

00:04:30.080 --> 00:04:30.090 
darkening slightly so that's the chips

00:04:30.090 --> 00:04:31.470 
darkening slightly so that's the chips
