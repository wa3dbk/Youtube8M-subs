00:00:00.410 --> 00:00:03.260 

here's<00:00:01.410> our<00:00:01.589> sample<00:00:02.040> from<00:00:02.340> the<00:00:02.730> Bearman

00:00:03.260 --> 00:00:03.270 
here's our sample from the Bearman

00:00:03.270 --> 00:00:06.039 
here's our sample from the Bearman
funnels<00:00:03.659> I'm<00:00:03.870> now<00:00:04.710> in<00:00:04.920> the<00:00:04.980> microscopy<00:00:05.430> lab

00:00:06.039 --> 00:00:06.049 
funnels I'm now in the microscopy lab

00:00:06.049 --> 00:00:08.720 
funnels I'm now in the microscopy lab
and<00:00:07.049> I'm<00:00:07.259> going<00:00:07.740> to<00:00:07.770> show<00:00:08.010> you<00:00:08.069> the<00:00:08.280> technique

00:00:08.720 --> 00:00:08.730 
and I'm going to show you the technique

00:00:08.730 --> 00:00:12.230 
and I'm going to show you the technique
that<00:00:08.760> we<00:00:09.000> use<00:00:09.179> to<00:00:09.530> examine<00:00:10.530> this<00:00:11.219> sample<00:00:12.030> under

00:00:12.230 --> 00:00:12.240 
that we use to examine this sample under

00:00:12.240 --> 00:00:15.169 
that we use to examine this sample under
a<00:00:12.269> microscope<00:00:13.219> so<00:00:14.219> let's<00:00:14.759> open<00:00:14.910> up<00:00:15.120> this

00:00:15.169 --> 00:00:15.179 
a microscope so let's open up this

00:00:15.179 --> 00:00:18.500 
a microscope so let's open up this
sample<00:00:15.920> and<00:00:16.920> I<00:00:17.010> have<00:00:17.190> a<00:00:17.220> little<00:00:17.940> device<00:00:18.060> here

00:00:18.500 --> 00:00:18.510 
sample and I have a little device here

00:00:18.510 --> 00:00:21.260 
sample and I have a little device here
it's<00:00:18.690> just<00:00:18.930> simply<00:00:19.350> a<00:00:19.609> micropipette<00:00:20.609> or<00:00:21.210> a

00:00:21.260 --> 00:00:21.270 
it's just simply a micropipette or a

00:00:21.270 --> 00:00:23.509 
it's just simply a micropipette or a
passed<00:00:21.689> your<00:00:21.869> pipette<00:00:22.289> with<00:00:23.250> a<00:00:23.279> piece<00:00:23.490> of

00:00:23.509 --> 00:00:23.519 
passed your pipette with a piece of

00:00:23.519 --> 00:00:26.050 
passed your pipette with a piece of
tubing<00:00:23.820> on<00:00:24.119> it<00:00:24.300> and<00:00:24.480> I'm<00:00:24.960> going<00:00:25.260> to<00:00:25.289> gently

00:00:26.050 --> 00:00:26.060 
tubing on it and I'm going to gently

00:00:26.060 --> 00:00:38.770 
tubing on it and I'm going to gently
suck<00:00:27.060> up<00:00:27.269> if<00:00:27.449> you<00:00:27.570> like

00:00:38.770 --> 00:00:38.780 

00:00:38.780 --> 00:00:54.590 

I'll<00:00:39.410> take<00:00:39.620> another<00:00:39.850> another<00:00:40.850> sample

00:00:54.590 --> 00:00:54.600 

00:00:54.600 --> 00:00:57.200 

okay<00:00:55.350> like<00:00:55.620> that

00:00:57.200 --> 00:00:57.210 
okay like that

00:00:57.210 --> 00:01:01.660 
okay like that
and<00:00:57.420> now<00:00:57.990> I'm<00:00:58.200> going<00:00:58.440> to<00:00:58.700> examine<00:00:59.700> what<00:01:00.600> I<00:01:00.630> see

00:01:01.660 --> 00:01:01.670 
and now I'm going to examine what I see

00:01:01.670 --> 00:01:06.200 
and now I'm going to examine what I see
under<00:01:02.670> this<00:01:02.870> stereoscopic<00:01:03.870> microscope<00:01:04.860> and<00:01:05.210> I

00:01:06.200 --> 00:01:06.210 
under this stereoscopic microscope and I

00:01:06.210 --> 00:01:08.840 
under this stereoscopic microscope and I
have<00:01:06.540> a<00:01:06.570> camera<00:01:06.870> attachment<00:01:07.580> mounted<00:01:08.580> to<00:01:08.730> it

00:01:08.840 --> 00:01:08.850 
have a camera attachment mounted to it

00:01:08.850 --> 00:01:12.200 
have a camera attachment mounted to it
and<00:01:09.030> so<00:01:09.600> I'll<00:01:09.990> record<00:01:10.950> what<00:01:11.160> I<00:01:11.190> see<00:01:11.550> so<00:01:12.000> let's

00:01:12.200 --> 00:01:12.210 
and so I'll record what I see so let's

00:01:12.210 --> 00:01:22.460 
and so I'll record what I see so let's
have<00:01:12.360> a<00:01:12.420> look<00:01:20.180> at<00:01:21.180> low<00:01:21.420> magnification<00:01:21.810> of

00:01:22.460 --> 00:01:22.470
