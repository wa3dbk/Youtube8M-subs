have the chance and privilege once more

00:00:36.760 --> 00:00:39.780 
have the chance and privilege once more
to<00:00:37.030> test<00:00:37.269> the<00:00:37.449> meegan<00:00:38.080> a<00:00:38.290> civic<00:00:38.890> type-r<00:00:39.400> our

00:00:39.780 --> 00:00:39.790 
to test the meegan a civic type-r our

00:00:39.790 --> 00:00:42.350 
to test the meegan a civic type-r our
which<00:00:40.300> is<00:00:40.510> produced<00:00:40.989> on<00:00:41.140> three<00:00:41.680> hundred<00:00:41.739> units

00:00:42.350 --> 00:00:42.360 
which is produced on three hundred units

00:00:42.360 --> 00:00:44.850 
which is produced on three hundred units
so<00:00:43.360> what<00:00:43.659> is<00:00:43.780> the<00:00:43.870> difference<00:00:44.049> between<00:00:44.470> the

00:00:44.850 --> 00:00:44.860 
so what is the difference between the

00:00:44.860 --> 00:00:46.590 
so what is the difference between the
regular<00:00:45.040> civic<00:00:45.610> type-r<00:00:46.030> that<00:00:46.269> we<00:00:46.390> have<00:00:46.510> in

00:00:46.590 --> 00:00:46.600 
regular civic type-r that we have in

00:00:46.600 --> 00:00:49.890 
regular civic type-r that we have in
Japan<00:00:46.720> and<00:00:47.170> the<00:00:47.860> Mugen<00:00:48.250> Civic<00:00:49.000> type-r<00:00:49.479> are

00:00:49.890 --> 00:00:49.900 
Japan and the Mugen Civic type-r are

00:00:49.900 --> 00:00:52.770 
Japan and the Mugen Civic type-r are
well<00:00:50.589> a<00:00:50.769> lot<00:00:50.949> of<00:00:50.979> things<00:00:51.220> basically<00:00:52.030> sis<00:00:52.570> cough

00:00:52.770 --> 00:00:52.780 
well a lot of things basically sis cough

well a lot of things basically sis cough
that<00:00:53.049> you<00:00:53.170> can<00:00:53.379> see<00:00:53.530> behind<00:00:53.650> me<00:00:53.890> is<00:00:54.129> a<00:00:54.369> little

00:00:54.899 --> 00:00:54.909 
that you can see behind me is a little

00:00:54.909 --> 00:00:57.630 
that you can see behind me is a little
bit<00:00:55.030> more<00:00:55.180> powerful<00:00:55.570> we<00:00:55.989> have<00:00:56.140> here<00:00:56.379> 240<00:00:57.309> PS

00:00:57.630 --> 00:00:57.640 
bit more powerful we have here 240 PS

00:00:57.640 --> 00:01:00.539 
bit more powerful we have here 240 PS
and<00:00:58.150> an<00:00:58.570> increase<00:00:58.930> of<00:00:59.110> 15<00:00:59.500> PS<00:00:59.830> compared<00:01:00.220> to<00:01:00.369> the

00:01:00.539 --> 00:01:00.549 
and an increase of 15 PS compared to the

00:01:00.549 --> 00:01:03.299 
and an increase of 15 PS compared to the
Civic<00:01:01.210> type-r<00:01:01.720> from<00:01:01.930> Honda<00:01:02.199> for<00:01:02.920> the<00:01:03.070> torque

00:01:03.299 --> 00:01:03.309 
Civic type-r from Honda for the torque

00:01:03.309 --> 00:01:06.480 
Civic type-r from Honda for the torque
it's<00:01:03.820> a<00:01:04.030> little<00:01:04.299> bit<00:01:04.449> more<00:01:04.869> powerful<00:01:05.490> 218

00:01:06.480 --> 00:01:06.490 
it's a little bit more powerful 218

00:01:06.490 --> 00:01:09.420 
it's a little bit more powerful 218
compared<00:01:07.090> to<00:01:07.210> 215<00:01:07.960> on<00:01:08.229> the<00:01:08.380> regular<00:01:08.710> model<00:01:09.010> and

00:01:09.420 --> 00:01:09.430 
compared to 215 on the regular model and

00:01:09.430 --> 00:01:12.810 
compared to 215 on the regular model and
we<00:01:10.090> also<00:01:10.360> lose<00:01:10.930> a<00:01:11.200> lot<00:01:11.409> of<00:01:11.439> weight<00:01:11.770> of<00:01:12.130> 15<00:01:12.549> kilo

00:01:12.810 --> 00:01:12.820 
we also lose a lot of weight of 15 kilo

00:01:12.820 --> 00:01:17.700 
we also lose a lot of weight of 15 kilo
and<00:01:13.030> since<00:01:13.299> one<00:01:13.450> is<00:01:13.679> 1200<00:01:14.679> 55<00:01:15.159> kg<00:01:15.460> so<00:01:16.450> here<00:01:17.350> the

00:01:17.700 --> 00:01:17.710 
and since one is 1200 55 kg so here the

00:01:17.710 --> 00:01:19.740 
and since one is 1200 55 kg so here the
Burnet<00:01:18.009> is<00:01:18.219> aluminium<00:01:18.609> here<00:01:19.179> we<00:01:19.329> have<00:01:19.450> a

00:01:19.740 --> 00:01:19.750 
Burnet is aluminium here we have a

00:01:19.750 --> 00:01:21.690 
Burnet is aluminium here we have a
carbon<00:01:20.109> fiber<00:01:20.320> we<00:01:20.920> also<00:01:21.189> have<00:01:21.460> a<00:01:21.520> lot<00:01:21.670> of

00:01:21.690 --> 00:01:21.700 
carbon fiber we also have a lot of

00:01:21.700 --> 00:01:23.999 
carbon fiber we also have a lot of
carbon<00:01:22.119> fiber<00:01:22.299> inside<00:01:22.869> of<00:01:22.990> the<00:01:23.079> car<00:01:23.289> and<00:01:23.469> we

00:01:23.999 --> 00:01:24.009 
carbon fiber inside of the car and we

00:01:24.009 --> 00:01:25.709 
carbon fiber inside of the car and we
have<00:01:24.159> a<00:01:24.189> lot<00:01:24.340> of<00:01:24.369> carbon<00:01:24.670> fiber<00:01:25.000> on<00:01:25.240> the<00:01:25.329> back

00:01:25.709 --> 00:01:25.719 
have a lot of carbon fiber on the back

00:01:25.719 --> 00:01:28.560 
have a lot of carbon fiber on the back
for<00:01:26.229> example<00:01:26.590> with<00:01:26.740> the<00:01:26.829> rear<00:01:27.009> spoiler<00:01:27.570> so

00:01:28.560 --> 00:01:28.570 
for example with the rear spoiler so

00:01:28.570 --> 00:01:31.739 
for example with the rear spoiler so
cisco<00:01:29.560> has<00:01:29.740> been<00:01:30.280> made<00:01:30.579> for<00:01:30.789> only<00:01:30.969> one<00:01:31.329> purpose

00:01:31.739 --> 00:01:31.749 
cisco has been made for only one purpose

00:01:31.749 --> 00:01:33.929 
cisco has been made for only one purpose
in<00:01:32.229> order<00:01:32.439> to<00:01:32.679> be<00:01:32.799> used<00:01:33.009> on<00:01:33.219> restaurant<00:01:33.700> and

00:01:33.929 --> 00:01:33.939 
in order to be used on restaurant and

00:01:33.939 --> 00:01:36.090 
in order to be used on restaurant and
fortunately<00:01:34.719> we<00:01:35.409> didn't<00:01:35.679> have<00:01:35.770> a<00:01:35.799> chance

00:01:36.090 --> 00:01:36.100 
fortunately we didn't have a chance

00:01:36.100 --> 00:01:38.069 
fortunately we didn't have a chance
actually<00:01:36.579> to<00:01:36.729> find<00:01:36.909> a<00:01:37.149> racetrack<00:01:37.359> available

00:01:38.069 --> 00:01:38.079 
actually to find a racetrack available

00:01:38.079 --> 00:01:40.830 
actually to find a racetrack available
for<00:01:38.259> this<00:01:38.409> test<00:01:38.619> today<00:01:38.829> so<00:01:38.890> we<00:01:39.819> really<00:01:40.179> need<00:01:40.359> to

00:01:40.830 --> 00:01:40.840 
for this test today so we really need to

00:01:40.840 --> 00:01:43.469 
for this test today so we really need to
have<00:01:41.380> the<00:01:41.590> chance<00:01:41.799> to<00:01:41.890> use<00:01:42.090> the<00:01:43.090> road<00:01:43.299> like

00:01:43.469 --> 00:01:43.479 
have the chance to use the road like

00:01:43.479 --> 00:01:45.719 
have the chance to use the road like
here<00:01:43.780> which<00:01:44.140> has<00:01:44.350> been<00:01:44.380> closed<00:01:44.740> for<00:01:44.770> us<00:01:45.100> so

00:01:45.719 --> 00:01:45.729 
here which has been closed for us so

00:01:45.729 --> 00:01:48.239 
here which has been closed for us so
this<00:01:46.240> car<00:01:46.450> has<00:01:46.569> remained<00:01:46.990> for<00:01:47.229> fun<00:01:47.469> in<00:01:47.679> four
