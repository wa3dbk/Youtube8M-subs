have to correct those and going it to
this<00:01:53.159> next<00:01:53.520> game<00:01:53.670> though<00:01:53.939> we<00:01:54.119> have<00:01:54.270> to<00:01:54.390> just<00:01:54.600> be

00:01:54.740 --> 00:01:54.750 
this next game though we have to just be

00:01:54.750 --> 00:01:55.310 
this next game though we have to just be
more

00:01:55.310 --> 00:01:55.320 
more

00:01:55.320 --> 00:01:58.380 
more
and<00:01:56.320> cautious<00:01:57.280> about<00:01:57.430> what<00:01:57.580> we're<00:01:57.880> doing<00:01:58.180> here

00:01:58.380 --> 00:01:58.390 
and cautious about what we're doing here

00:01:58.390 --> 00:02:00.540 
and cautious about what we're doing here
so<00:01:58.600> we<00:01:59.080> have<00:01:59.200> to<00:01:59.320> just<00:01:59.500> correct<00:01:59.830> pose<00:02:00.040> during

00:02:00.540 --> 00:02:00.550 
so we have to just correct pose during

00:02:00.550 --> 00:02:03.810 
so we have to just correct pose during
practice<00:02:01.060> for<00:02:01.300> us<00:02:02.230> to<00:02:02.440> perform<00:02:02.620> better<00:02:02.980> in<00:02:03.340> the

00:02:03.810 --> 00:02:03.820 
practice for us to perform better in the

00:02:03.820 --> 00:02:06.270 
practice for us to perform better in the
game<00:02:04.000> that<00:02:04.360> performance<00:02:05.050> I<00:02:05.110> feel<00:02:05.320> that<00:02:05.500> some

00:02:06.270 --> 00:02:06.280 
game that performance I feel that some

00:02:06.280 --> 00:02:07.650 
game that performance I feel that some
people<00:02:06.460> might<00:02:06.580> say<00:02:06.790> the<00:02:06.940> defense<00:02:07.240> has<00:02:07.390> nothing

00:02:07.650 --> 00:02:07.660 
people might say the defense has nothing

00:02:07.660 --> 00:02:09.180 
people might say the defense has nothing
to<00:02:07.780> get<00:02:07.930> better<00:02:08.080> on<00:02:08.170> but<00:02:08.470> how<00:02:08.830> do<00:02:08.890> you<00:02:08.979> feel

00:02:09.180 --> 00:02:09.190
