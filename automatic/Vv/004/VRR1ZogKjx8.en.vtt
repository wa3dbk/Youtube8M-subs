00:02:12.120 --> 00:02:12.130 
started off by thinking I was going to

00:02:12.130 --> 00:02:14.900 
started off by thinking I was going to
do<00:02:12.250> a<00:02:12.280> pinwheel<00:02:12.760> with<00:02:12.970> this<00:02:13.180> one<00:02:13.390> and<00:02:13.990> then<00:02:14.230> I

00:02:14.900 --> 00:02:14.910 
do a pinwheel with this one and then I

00:02:14.910 --> 00:02:27.960 
do a pinwheel with this one and then I
changed<00:02:15.910> my<00:02:16.090> mind

00:02:27.960 --> 00:02:27.970 

00:02:27.970 --> 00:02:30.460 

now<00:02:28.970> go<00:02:29.150> to<00:02:29.209> the<00:02:29.390> pinwheel<00:02:29.780> and<00:02:29.959> I<00:02:30.170> added

00:02:30.460 --> 00:02:30.470 
now go to the pinwheel and I added

00:02:30.470 --> 00:02:32.619 
now go to the pinwheel and I added
another<00:02:30.590> drop<00:02:31.040> of<00:02:31.190> white<00:02:31.459> polish<00:02:31.760> into<00:02:32.510> the

00:02:32.619 --> 00:02:32.629 
another drop of white polish into the

00:02:32.629 --> 00:02:34.809 
another drop of white polish into the
center<00:02:32.959> of<00:02:33.080> that<00:02:33.260> pinwheel<00:02:33.739> and<00:02:33.920> then<00:02:34.549> just

00:02:34.809 --> 00:02:34.819 
center of that pinwheel and then just

00:02:34.819 --> 00:02:38.140 
center of that pinwheel and then just
another<00:02:35.690> drop<00:02:36.379> of<00:02:36.409> black<00:02:36.830> and<00:02:37.400> then<00:02:37.730> started

00:02:38.140 --> 00:02:38.150 
another drop of black and then started

00:02:38.150 --> 00:02:40.600 
another drop of black and then started
having<00:02:38.450> a<00:02:38.510> bit<00:02:38.690> more<00:02:38.720> of<00:02:39.019> a<00:02:39.140> play<00:02:39.409> and<00:02:40.370> now<00:02:40.459> this

00:02:40.600 --> 00:02:40.610 
having a bit more of a play and now this

00:02:40.610 --> 00:02:42.369 
having a bit more of a play and now this
is<00:02:40.819> the<00:02:41.000> kind<00:02:41.209> of<00:02:41.360> water<00:02:41.569> level<00:02:41.900> I<00:02:41.959> used<00:02:42.170> to<00:02:42.260> do

00:02:42.369 --> 00:02:42.379 
is the kind of water level I used to do

00:02:42.379 --> 00:02:44.530 
is the kind of water level I used to do
with<00:02:42.530> my<00:02:42.709> mother<00:02:42.950> when<00:02:43.159> I<00:02:43.190> was<00:02:43.280> younger<00:02:43.760> when

00:02:44.530 --> 00:02:44.540 
with my mother when I was younger when

00:02:44.540 --> 00:02:46.240 
with my mother when I was younger when
she<00:02:44.810> first<00:02:45.019> taught<00:02:45.319> me<00:02:45.440> how<00:02:45.560> to<00:02:45.590> water<00:02:45.890> marble

00:02:46.240 --> 00:02:46.250 
she first taught me how to water marble

00:02:46.250 --> 00:02:49.600 
she first taught me how to water marble
with<00:02:46.400> paint<00:02:46.790> and<00:02:47.349> look<00:02:48.349> you<00:02:48.829> just<00:02:48.890> need<00:02:49.310> to

00:02:49.600 --> 00:02:49.610 
with paint and look you just need to

00:02:49.610 --> 00:02:52.500 
with paint and look you just need to
have<00:02:49.790> a<00:02:49.819> go<00:02:50.120> I've<00:02:50.840> said<00:02:51.079> this<00:02:51.200> on<00:02:51.379> a<00:02:51.440> previous

00:02:52.500 --> 00:02:52.510 
have a go I've said this on a previous

00:02:52.510 --> 00:02:55.720 
have a go I've said this on a previous
water<00:02:53.510> marble<00:02:53.930> video<00:02:54.200> it<00:02:54.950> is<00:02:55.310> really

00:02:55.720 --> 00:02:55.730 
water marble video it is really

00:02:55.730 --> 00:02:57.850 
water marble video it is really
important<00:02:56.150> that<00:02:56.209> you<00:02:56.329> that<00:02:56.780> you<00:02:56.870> try<00:02:57.230> doing<00:02:57.590> it

00:02:57.850 --> 00:02:57.860 
important that you that you try doing it

00:02:57.860 --> 00:02:59.920 
important that you that you try doing it
this<00:02:58.010> way<00:02:58.090> before<00:02:59.090> trying<00:02:59.420> to<00:02:59.480> make<00:02:59.720> all<00:02:59.900> of

00:02:59.920 --> 00:02:59.930 
this way before trying to make all of

00:02:59.930 --> 00:03:02.740 
this way before trying to make all of
these<00:03:00.140> fancy<00:03:00.709> schmancy<00:03:01.340> shapes<00:03:02.180> and<00:03:02.450> whatnot

00:03:02.740 --> 00:03:02.750 
these fancy schmancy shapes and whatnot

00:03:02.750 --> 00:03:05.319 
these fancy schmancy shapes and whatnot
and<00:03:02.900> I<00:03:02.989> think<00:03:03.319> this<00:03:03.920> is<00:03:04.099> kind<00:03:04.340> of<00:03:04.430> really<00:03:04.640> much

00:03:05.319 --> 00:03:05.329 
and I think this is kind of really much

00:03:05.329 --> 00:03:07.960 
and I think this is kind of really much
cooler<00:03:05.720> because<00:03:06.079> you're<00:03:06.500> making<00:03:06.709> a<00:03:07.129> work<00:03:07.760> of

00:03:07.960 --> 00:03:07.970 
cooler because you're making a work of

00:03:07.970 --> 00:03:10.930 
cooler because you're making a work of
art<00:03:08.150> for<00:03:08.720> your<00:03:08.840> nails<00:03:09.140> that<00:03:10.099> is<00:03:10.280> nothing<00:03:10.760> like

00:03:10.930 --> 00:03:10.940 
art for your nails that is nothing like

00:03:10.940 --> 00:03:13.210 
art for your nails that is nothing like
anything<00:03:11.660> else<00:03:11.870> that<00:03:12.140> anyone<00:03:12.500> has<00:03:12.829> ever<00:03:13.069> done

00:03:13.210 --> 00:03:13.220 
anything else that anyone has ever done

00:03:13.220 --> 00:03:16.470 
anything else that anyone has ever done
before<00:03:13.609> in<00:03:14.510> the<00:03:14.690> history<00:03:14.720> of<00:03:15.200> everything
