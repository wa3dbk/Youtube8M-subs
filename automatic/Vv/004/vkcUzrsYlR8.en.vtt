they<00:01:01.379> did<00:01:01.530> a<00:01:01.559> switch<00:01:01.859> and<00:01:02.100> added<00:01:02.370> some<00:01:02.489> it

00:01:02.660 --> 00:01:02.670 
they did a switch and added some it

00:01:02.670 --> 00:01:04.579 
they did a switch and added some it
increase<00:01:03.270> specs<00:01:03.570> in<00:01:03.719> there<00:01:03.840> but<00:01:04.049> I<00:01:04.080> mean<00:01:04.350> come

00:01:04.579 --> 00:01:04.589 
increase specs in there but I mean come

00:01:04.589 --> 00:01:04.729 
increase specs in there but I mean come
on

00:01:04.729 --> 00:01:04.739 
on

00:01:04.739 --> 00:01:06.679 
on
they<00:01:04.949> need<00:01:05.129> to<00:01:05.250> they<00:01:05.790> need<00:01:05.939> to<00:01:06.060> keep<00:01:06.299> it<00:01:06.479> to

00:01:06.679 --> 00:01:06.689 
they need to they need to keep it to

00:01:06.689 --> 00:01:08.810 
they need to they need to keep it to
just<00:01:06.720> one<00:01:06.990> model<00:01:07.710> if<00:01:08.010> they<00:01:08.220> do<00:01:08.280> that<00:01:08.549> and<00:01:08.700> we'll

00:01:08.810 --> 00:01:08.820 
just one model if they do that and we'll

00:01:08.820 --> 00:01:10.310 
just one model if they do that and we'll
probably<00:01:09.000> sell<00:01:09.360> better<00:01:09.540> and<00:01:09.750> there<00:01:09.840> will<00:01:09.990> be

00:01:10.310 --> 00:01:10.320 
probably sell better and there will be

00:01:10.320 --> 00:01:12.230 
probably sell better and there will be
less<00:01:10.590> competition<00:01:11.010> between<00:01:11.280> either<00:01:11.670> iPhone

00:01:12.230 --> 00:01:12.240 
less competition between either iPhone

00:01:16.010 --> 00:01:16.020 
but with the iPhone 5 or 4s there will

00:01:16.020 --> 00:01:18.230 
but with the iPhone 5 or 4s there will
only<00:01:16.080> be<00:01:16.200> one<00:01:16.350> iPhone<00:01:16.860> for<00:01:17.100> both<00:01:17.220> carriers<00:01:17.700> so

00:01:18.230 --> 00:01:18.240 
only be one iPhone for both carriers so

00:01:18.240 --> 00:01:20.420 
only be one iPhone for both carriers so
there<00:01:18.540> won't<00:01:18.720> have<00:01:18.900> to<00:01:18.990> be<00:01:19.220> manufacturing<00:01:20.220> or

00:01:20.420 --> 00:01:20.430 
there won't have to be manufacturing or

00:01:20.430 --> 00:01:22.749 
there won't have to be manufacturing or
other<00:01:20.640> cases<00:01:21.240> for<00:01:21.750> it<00:01:21.810> it<00:01:21.900> will<00:01:22.020> all<00:01:22.140> just<00:01:22.170> fit

00:01:22.749 --> 00:01:22.759 
other cases for it it will all just fit

00:01:22.759 --> 00:01:26.390 
other cases for it it will all just fit
the<00:01:23.759> carrier<00:01:24.000> and<00:01:24.330> the<00:01:24.930> cases<00:01:25.680> will<00:01:25.920> all<00:01:26.159> fit
