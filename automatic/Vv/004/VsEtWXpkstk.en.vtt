00:00:00.019 --> 00:00:00.999
 Its possible 

00:00:00.999 --> 00:00:03.480
 2:46 pm 

00:00:03.480 --> 00:00:06.480
 Welcome to that moment 

00:00:17.890 --> 00:00:20.400
 A maximum seismic intensity of 7 was recorded 

00:00:20.400 --> 00:00:23.400
 Business scale implementation 

00:00:25.239 --> 00:00:26.560
 Too much shaking 

00:00:26.560 --> 00:00:29.560
 The company has advanced 

00:00:30.189 --> 00:00:33.540
 Only about one hour before 4:00 pm 

00:00:33.540 --> 00:00:36.540
 It was time to get together in a traffic jam 

00:00:37.800 --> 00:00:40.090
 From the left of the screen 

00:00:40.090 --> 00:00:43.090
 It is a plurality of cars which are prolonged by the tsunami 

00:00:52.170 --> 00:00:54.620
 This time also from behind 

00:00:54.620 --> 00:00:57.620
 Suzunami is rushing 

00:00:58.930 --> 00:01:02.330
 10 seconds while waiting for the car to reach the tsunami 

00:01:02.330 --> 00:01:04.840
 Mr. Muroka's car 

00:01:04.840 --> 00:01:07.840
 Start being done before 

00:01:13.830 --> 00:01:15.900
 And after 25 seconds 

00:01:15.900 --> 00:01:17.900
 The car can not beat completely 

00:01:17.900 --> 00:01:20.900
 I'll start visiting 

00:01:22.500 --> 00:01:25.970
 At this time, Mr. Muroka was still staying in-house 

00:01:28.680 --> 00:01:32.030
 Mr. Muroka's car is near the Kuroiwa headquarters ahead 

00:01:33.670 --> 00:01:36.670
 In the granddaughter there is a male figure 

00:01:40.940 --> 00:01:42.910
 Just before this collision 

00:01:42.910 --> 00:01:45.910
 It is said that the window was opened for thinking about running 

00:01:47.040 --> 00:01:50.040
 Party talks with each other 

00:01:55.100 --> 00:01:57.790
 Full of screen and mf narrative 

00:01:57.790 --> 00:02:00.740
 While flowing slowly to the right 

00:02:00.740 --> 00:02:03.580
 Not at the screen 

00:02:03.580 --> 00:02:06.580
 The track is edged to the left 

00:02:10.099 --> 00:02:14.379
 Evacuate on top of the car among the top actors who clashed 

00:02:14.379 --> 00:02:16.549
 I also see what you are doing 

00:02:16.549 --> 00:02:19.549
 here 

00:02:20.369 --> 00:02:21.359
 And 

00:02:21.359 --> 00:02:24.639
 Slowly turning car 

00:02:24.639 --> 00:02:26.069
 Then the camera 

00:02:26.069 --> 00:02:28.219
 The building's coming from now 

00:02:28.219 --> 00:02:31.219
 Caught a fierce flow 

00:02:33.059 --> 00:02:34.389
 In the car 

00:02:34.389 --> 00:02:37.480
 Broadcasting to tell about damage of tsunami that happened in another place 

00:02:52.319 --> 00:02:55.209
 At this time, the room loses 3 

00:02:55.209 --> 00:02:58.639
 It has been said for a long time when we will escape from the car 

00:03:11.389 --> 00:03:14.859
 And then the quintet 4. 

00:03:15.829 --> 00:03:17.919
 As the car is water soluble 

00:03:17.919 --> 00:03:20.919
 I was caught in a fast flowing stream 

00:03:29.129 --> 00:03:32.129
 A car swayed by conditions 

00:03:32.849 --> 00:03:34.019
 In front of you 

00:03:34.019 --> 00:03:37.019
 I was wrapped up in another falling connection 

00:03:46.189 --> 00:03:48.279
 The car that started the interview 

00:03:48.279 --> 00:03:50.139
 While carrying Mr. Muroka 

00:03:50.139 --> 00:03:53.139
 By the way continue to be fooled 

00:04:06.069 --> 00:04:07.259
 And 

00:04:07.259 --> 00:04:08.939
 From the tsunami song 

00:04:08.939 --> 00:04:11.939
 Included more than expected 

00:04:17.449 --> 00:04:19.539
 kreva collides with the building 

00:04:19.539 --> 00:04:21.809
 To Mitsubishi Electric .com 

00:04:21.809 --> 00:04:22.619
 The picture is
