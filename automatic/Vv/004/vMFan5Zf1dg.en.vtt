00:00:03.740 --> 00:00:07.980
 i am for mobile kicks and here are 

00:00:06.359 --> 00:00:09.600
 Today with our nice colleagues from 

00:00:07.980 --> 00:00:13.110
 notebook info because they had something more 

00:00:09.600 --> 00:00:14.490
 luck with the order and there has google 

00:00:13.110 --> 00:00:16.470
 Wallet even participated exceptionally 

00:00:14.490 --> 00:00:18.330
 and they got the nexus 10 

00:00:16.470 --> 00:00:20.430
 with the nexus 4 also has if not him 

00:00:18.330 --> 00:00:22.740
 but at least the next scene worked 

00:00:20.430 --> 00:00:24.840
 It is the new 10 inch tablet from 

00:00:22.740 --> 00:00:26.160
 google and samsung in this case and 

00:00:24.840 --> 00:00:30.660
 we'll just get it out of the box 

00:00:26.160 --> 00:00:32.940
 Here we have the standard case and 

00:00:30.660 --> 00:00:35.310
 including seven, as with the nexus 

00:00:32.940 --> 00:00:36.840
 simple and black box with nothing 

00:00:35.310 --> 00:00:38.579
 continue on it except here below right 

00:00:36.840 --> 00:00:40.680
 Maybe you can see it so small 

00:00:38.579 --> 00:00:42.530
 Next, logo and that's just look 

00:00:40.680 --> 00:00:46.380
 Just have a look 

00:00:42.530 --> 00:00:49.050
 nexus 10 from samsung has a 10 inches 

00:00:46.380 --> 00:00:51.719
 display is therefore quite a lot 

00:00:49.050 --> 00:00:55.350
 bigger than the 7 inches of haasis 

00:00:51.719 --> 00:00:57.360
 produced next 7 and does that on the 

00:00:55.350 --> 00:01:00.270
 first impression ever good impression 

00:00:57.360 --> 00:01:01.620
 But first look nothing further in there 

00:01:00.270 --> 00:01:04.259
 is not much more in it 

00:01:01.620 --> 00:01:06.149
 outside as usual nowadays the 

00:01:04.259 --> 00:01:10.229
 micro usb cable for connection ans 

00:01:06.149 --> 00:01:11.280
 power supply and the power supply itself sees 

00:01:10.229 --> 00:01:12.959
 that's what you might know quickly 

00:01:11.280 --> 00:01:14.999
 already from other android tablets by 

00:01:12.959 --> 00:01:17.909
 So samsung has its usb 2.0 connection 

00:01:14.999 --> 00:01:19.679
 and on the back but adapter 

00:01:17.909 --> 00:01:20.909
 port as you can to the emergency a whole 

00:01:19.679 --> 00:01:22.259
 normal two political power cable 

00:01:20.909 --> 00:01:24.060
 then a little bit around the device 

00:01:22.259 --> 00:01:25.889
 continue to load away from a wall 

00:01:24.060 --> 00:01:28.529
 otherwise , just the adapter 

00:01:25.889 --> 00:01:33.149
 used here standard plug and the 

00:01:28.529 --> 00:01:35.459
 It was always a bit like that 

00:01:33.149 --> 00:01:36.569
 paper very pointless because that will be 

00:01:35.459 --> 00:01:38.130
 do not look at anyone 

00:01:36.569 --> 00:01:40.889
 Except maybe has a warranty 

00:01:38.130 --> 00:01:44.579
 and can not find the info online 

00:01:40.889 --> 00:01:50.429
 more is not in it corner is so even 

00:01:44.579 --> 00:01:51.899
 let's go and it will be the first to notice that 

00:01:50.429 --> 00:01:54.179
 it again here for the meantime 

00:01:51.899 --> 00:01:55.679
 samsung typical design with the 

00:01:54.179 --> 00:01:56.520
 Speakers on the on the 

00:01:55.679 --> 00:01:58.469
 front is 

00:01:56.520 --> 00:01:59.819
 that's how the koreans protect themselves 

00:01:58.469 --> 00:02:01.259
 little before the attacks of apple 

00:01:59.819 --> 00:02:03.569
 because of vomiting and teasing and but 

00:02:01.259 --> 00:02:05.399
 say and we look very fast 

00:02:03.569 --> 00:02:08.550
 there we have it up front 

00:02:05.399 --> 00:02:09.840
 front the camera a bit off 

00:02:08.550 --> 00:02:11.110
 arranged from the middle 

00:02:09.840 --> 00:02:14.830
 is still sitting to the left 

00:02:11.110 --> 00:02:16.570
 sensor like left and right 

00:02:14.830 --> 00:02:18.820
 said the speakers and on the 

00:02:16.570 --> 00:02:22.720
 on the left side we have a micro usb 

00:02:18.820 --> 00:02:25.180
 port the speaker and connect 

00:02:22.720 --> 00:02:28.420
 the top of the power button 

00:02:25.180 --> 00:02:30.730
 the volume rocker and on the right 

00:02:28.420 --> 00:02:32.230
 side still a micro hdmi output to 

00:02:30.730 --> 00:02:34.900
 connection to the television or a 

00:02:32.230 --> 00:02:37.690
 other external large display on the ground 

00:02:34.900 --> 00:02:38.890
 So a few poppins can be there in the future 

00:02:37.690 --> 00:02:40.330
 hopefully maybe someday 

00:02:38.890 --> 00:02:42.970
 include there or at least one 

00:02:40.330 --> 00:02:45.370
 charging station or similar and on the 

00:02:42.970 --> 00:02:47.050
 back there is also a 5 

00:02:45.370 --> 00:02:48.760
 Megapixel camera which has on the front 

00:02:47.050 --> 00:02:50.140
 By the way, 1.9 megapixels I have just 

00:02:48.760 --> 00:02:52.480
 forget next to it still sits the led 

00:02:50.140 --> 00:02:56.650
 lightning and a small microphone 

00:02:52.480 --> 00:02:58.060
 the back is plastic as well as the 

00:02:56.650 --> 00:03:00.520
 Whole rest of the device except of course the 

00:02:58.060 --> 00:03:02.770
 front covered with gorilla glass 

00:03:00.520 --> 00:03:03.100
 and we just turn it on 

00:03:02.770 --> 00:03:05.440
 on 

00:03:03.100 --> 00:03:06.520
 the special here is not just that 

00:03:05.440 --> 00:03:08.260
 the device becomes a relatively cheap one 

00:03:06.520 --> 00:03:10.840
 Price of samsung and google together 

00:03:08.260 --> 00:03:13.300
 namely, this 390 euros will be distributed 

00:03:10.840 --> 00:03:16.600
 start price but that it is just the 

00:03:13.300 --> 00:03:21.220
 first cortex a15 processor is that is 

00:03:16.600 --> 00:03:24.220
 in the case of samsung exynos 552 ten 

00:03:21.220 --> 00:03:26.560
 young choir of 17 gigahertz faith 

00:03:24.220 --> 00:03:29.680
 I have some speed and some performance 

00:03:26.560 --> 00:03:33.310
 offers he was just said that 

00:03:29.680 --> 00:03:35.769
 Just get into quadrant 

00:03:33.310 --> 00:03:37.930
 The nexus 4 reaches 4,700 points 

00:03:35.769 --> 00:03:42.040
 Comparison with tegra 3 on cortex a9 

00:03:37.930 --> 00:03:43.900
 base comes only at 3600 points approximately 

00:03:42.040 --> 00:03:46.090
 is therefore a big performance difference 

00:03:43.900 --> 00:03:47.950
 also in the graphic despite the 

00:03:46.090 --> 00:03:49.239
 high resolution displays that is 

00:03:47.950 --> 00:03:49.690
 the second special point on this 

00:03:49.239 --> 00:03:53.709
 device 

00:03:49.690 --> 00:03:56.980
 that's 10 inches diagonal only but 2560 

00:03:53.709 --> 00:03:59.560
 x 1600 pixel resolution in 16 9 format 

00:03:56.980 --> 00:04:01.209
 So you can not see it there 

00:03:59.560 --> 00:04:04.570
 any pixels or similar 

00:04:01.209 --> 00:04:08.769
 but that resolves very extremely high 

00:04:04.570 --> 00:04:11.829
 to which it was actually this is the 

00:04:08.769 --> 00:04:13.299
 New Samsung Nexus 10 is powered by google 

00:04:11.829 --> 00:04:15.989
 and samsung was evicted I was 

00:04:13.299 --> 00:04:15.989
 probably for mobile games
