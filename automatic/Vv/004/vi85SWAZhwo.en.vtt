00:00:03.650 --> 00:00:08.519
 Hey, people, this is cricket. 

00:00:06.259 --> 00:00:11.610
 bring you a good tutorial today 

00:00:08.519 --> 00:00:13.290
 simple is how you were 

00:00:11.610 --> 00:00:16.980
 the type of case you have made maps 

00:00:13.290 --> 00:00:18.750
 backup format the computer etc etc or 

00:00:16.980 --> 00:00:22.230
 even you do not have a map and still 

00:00:18.750 --> 00:00:24.210
 want to play with a more open map in the 

00:00:22.230 --> 00:00:28.160
 download section our site and us 

00:00:24.210 --> 00:00:31.080
 we provide a file with the map 

00:00:28.160 --> 00:00:36.899
 practically all open today that more 

00:00:31.080 --> 00:00:39.030
 95% of the map is open then it is to teach 

00:00:36.899 --> 00:00:42.120
 the whole process for you since 

00:00:39.030 --> 00:00:45.030
 download the site maps is to put them in the 

00:00:42.120 --> 00:00:46.500
 good correct folder 

00:00:45.030 --> 00:00:51.809
 the first thing you have to do is 

00:00:46.500 --> 00:00:54.329
 is to open the folder where the maps are 

00:00:51.809 --> 00:00:56.340
 so I 'm going to open that run I go 

00:00:54.329 --> 00:01:02.280
 dictate this commander here that I go 

00:00:56.340 --> 00:01:05.309
 explain to you later how you 

00:01:02.280 --> 00:01:08.010
 they can see that no error saying that 

00:01:05.309 --> 00:01:10.320
 the folder does not exist that happens to you 

00:01:08.010 --> 00:01:12.180
 Never ran a team before, for example, it ends. 

00:01:10.320 --> 00:01:13.920
 to format the machine installed the team 

00:01:12.180 --> 00:01:17.189
 more rounded it is then the first thing 

00:01:13.920 --> 00:01:20.939
 to run the team so April I had 

00:01:17.189 --> 00:01:25.049
 just open and close 

00:01:20.939 --> 00:01:26.580
 Okay, now I'm going to do the following, I 

00:01:25.049 --> 00:01:31.020
 I'll hold that line 

00:01:26.580 --> 00:01:34.430
 windows and shake the mouse r and then I 

00:01:31.020 --> 00:01:34.430
 I introduce fight beauty 

00:01:36.120 --> 00:01:45.970
 so now the egypt app dates between 

00:01:41.310 --> 00:01:47.740
 percentages are not bar I had to like 

00:01:45.970 --> 00:01:50.590
 You are seeing here your way. 

00:01:47.740 --> 00:01:52.930
 standard to find the folder are the maps 

00:01:50.590 --> 00:01:54.190
 settings then click 

00:01:52.930 --> 00:01:57.250
 here it looks 

00:01:54.190 --> 00:01:59.290
 here is the configuration file I had 

00:01:57.250 --> 00:02:01.720
 with seven regions was left with keys and here 

00:01:59.290 --> 00:02:03.760
 within the map packet that in the case 

00:02:01.720 --> 00:02:07.440
 it is empty 

00:02:03.760 --> 00:02:10.680
 Okay, then, by the time I'm leaving. 

00:02:07.440 --> 00:02:14.580
 these two is this folder that is opened 

00:02:10.680 --> 00:02:22.080
 now we come in chile en 

00:02:14.580 --> 00:02:22.080
 Let's download these maps there. 

00:02:22.600 --> 00:02:30.340
 take a look at what you have to go there 

00:02:26.140 --> 00:02:31.600
 in the downloads section on the site is here 

00:02:30.340 --> 00:02:34.600
 on the side 

00:02:31.600 --> 00:02:38.459
 the main menu or up here in the 

00:02:34.600 --> 00:02:38.459
 quick access or fast access 

00:02:40.680 --> 00:02:46.020
 arriving there explain them that in programs 

00:02:43.360 --> 00:02:46.020

00:02:48.340 --> 00:02:53.170
 On this list you had to see the 

00:02:50.350 --> 00:02:55.900
 tib map reminding that these maps 

00:02:53.170 --> 00:02:58.450
 work both in windows accounts version 

00:02:55.900 --> 00:03:00.610
 the linux version is but in this tutorial 

00:02:58.450 --> 00:03:02.710
 I 'll cover the installation of the maps. 

00:03:00.610 --> 00:03:04.890
 on the windows versions 

00:03:02.710 --> 00:03:08.010
 here under an automatic installer 

00:03:04.890 --> 00:03:11.320
 for those who prefer a larger community 

00:03:08.010 --> 00:03:13.750
 to install your maps 

00:03:11.320 --> 00:03:16.120
 then this program available for 

00:03:13.750 --> 00:03:20.700
 You, but I'm going to teach the version today. 

00:03:16.120 --> 00:03:20.700
 manual we will click here tibia maps 

00:03:22.630 --> 00:03:27.250
 okay remembering that in case of any 

00:03:24.490 --> 00:03:29.500
 problem on the tibia will not be the fault 

00:03:27.250 --> 00:03:31.810
 show other and soft br then you use by 

00:03:29.500 --> 00:03:33.430
 at your own risk 

00:03:31.810 --> 00:03:37.290
 Of course we did not put any 

00:03:33.430 --> 00:03:40.210
 virus there only has map files 

00:03:37.290 --> 00:03:42.220
 this package is not something that 

00:03:40.210 --> 00:03:47.200
 worry is not executable or anything 

00:03:42.220 --> 00:03:50.170
 Like who will not get down here? 

00:03:47.200 --> 00:03:52.000
 put the code 

00:03:50.170 --> 00:03:55.380
 I'm not having vision problems. 

00:03:52.000 --> 00:03:59.800
 technique that 4 and will be downloadable 

00:03:55.380 --> 00:04:03.810
 requested to save the file to save it 

00:03:59.800 --> 00:04:21.370
 on my desktop as the 

00:04:03.810 --> 00:04:24.490
 saving until June will arrive a file 

00:04:21.370 --> 00:04:27.340
 very small attack is compressed it 

00:04:24.490 --> 00:04:31.240
 is smaller than 5 megaher than 

00:04:27.340 --> 00:04:35.260
 this file when opened and has more than 

00:04:31.240 --> 00:04:36.490
 90 mega church compression download 

00:04:35.260 --> 00:04:40.479
 completed 

00:04:36.490 --> 00:04:44.440
 here is our zip file where the 

00:04:40.479 --> 00:04:46.750
 maps are now the procedure is well 

00:04:44.440 --> 00:04:49.660
 simple but can do of several 

00:04:46.750 --> 00:04:51.850
 ways you can extract the maps 

00:04:49.660 --> 00:04:55.479
 by right-clicking and choosing 

00:04:51.850 --> 00:04:59.910
 Extract All May Not Double Click 

00:04:55.479 --> 00:05:03.100
 here and april you will see here look lonely 

00:04:59.910 --> 00:05:04.990
 the list of maps 

00:05:03.100 --> 00:05:06.730
 but I'll do it the following way 

00:05:04.990 --> 00:05:09.460
 Look, I'm just going to click the button. 

00:05:06.730 --> 00:05:12.370
 right-click hold 

00:05:09.460 --> 00:05:15.630
 but with a shadow or bringing one 

00:05:12.370 --> 00:05:20.350
 map folder that lets us open 

00:05:15.630 --> 00:05:22.510
 and I'll have it extracted 

00:05:20.350 --> 00:05:26.830
 asking for confirmation is talking about them 

00:05:22.510 --> 00:05:42.010
 go to that folder the mep send extract 

00:05:26.830 --> 00:05:44.230
 now I'll save a little bit on account 

00:05:42.010 --> 00:05:46.180
 of video recording this process is 

00:05:44.230 --> 00:05:49.120
 taken a little longer than is expected 

00:05:46.180 --> 00:05:51.160
 but this is very fast is in a 

00:05:49.120 --> 00:05:53.110
 Current computer takes a few 

00:05:51.160 --> 00:05:56.430
 seconds only to happen if the 

00:05:53.110 --> 00:05:58.870
 extraction as I'm recording this video 

00:05:56.430 --> 00:06:02.070
 he is talking will take a three 

00:05:58.870 --> 00:06:02.070
 minutes or less 

00:06:03.760 --> 00:06:08.680
 it is not possible that I make a small 

00:06:05.440 --> 00:06:10.120
 magic that fun and quickly become 

00:06:08.680 --> 00:06:14.800
 download will end 

00:06:10.120 --> 00:06:16.860
 Look ok, now the canopy is almost in the 

00:06:14.800 --> 00:06:16.860
 end 

00:06:25.720 --> 00:06:33.639
 It is very good that it appeared in the list of 

00:06:31.370 --> 00:06:37.129
 maps of files that were extracted 

00:06:33.639 --> 00:06:40.300
 can you take a look here 

00:06:37.129 --> 00:06:40.300
 all maps 

00:06:41.040 --> 00:06:51.530
 where they should be in the 

00:06:43.230 --> 00:06:57.930
 correct to pick up any character who 

00:06:51.530 --> 00:07:00.470
 already show you that the maps are 

00:06:57.930 --> 00:07:00.470
 open 

00:07:02.680 --> 00:07:05.610
 look that 

00:07:07.770 --> 00:07:16.570
 all open chip maps as 

00:07:11.139 --> 00:07:20.320
 You can look at linen - okay guys. 

00:07:16.570 --> 00:07:24.520
 so for now this is it I hope you 

00:07:20.320 --> 00:07:26.620
 have enjoyed tutorial in any 

00:07:24.520 --> 00:07:29.979
