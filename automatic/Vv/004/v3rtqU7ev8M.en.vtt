is absolutely atrocious this is how you
do<00:00:17.130> not<00:00:17.340> make<00:00:17.640> a<00:00:17.670> rule<00:00:17.940> book<00:00:18.320> it's<00:00:19.320> all<00:00:20.189> of<00:00:21.769> four

do not make a rule book it's all of four
pages<00:00:23.100> and<00:00:23.400> then<00:00:23.460> it<00:00:23.580> goes<00:00:23.699> into<00:00:23.760> German

00:00:24.320 --> 00:00:24.330 
pages and then it goes into German

pages and then it goes into German
there's<00:00:25.080> no<00:00:25.230> sample<00:00:25.800> play<00:00:26.039> it's<00:00:26.699> really<00:00:26.970> just

00:00:27.200 --> 00:00:27.210 
there's no sample play it's really just

00:00:33.780 --> 00:00:36.229 
know if i'm still playing rules properly
just<00:00:34.290> because<00:00:34.500> it's<00:00:34.710> it's<00:00:35.399> a<00:00:35.579> really<00:00:35.880> poor

00:00:36.229 --> 00:00:36.239 
just because it's it's a really poor

00:00:36.239 --> 00:00:39.799 
just because it's it's a really poor
rulebook<00:00:36.809> this<00:00:36.989> is<00:00:37.140> just<00:00:37.969> not<00:00:38.969> how<00:00:39.239> you<00:00:39.300> do<00:00:39.629> it

00:00:39.799 --> 00:00:39.809 
rulebook this is just not how you do it

00:00:39.809 --> 00:00:45.799 
rulebook this is just not how you do it
but<00:00:39.989> the<00:00:40.890> game<00:00:41.100> itself<00:00:41.340> is<00:00:42.270> pretty<00:00:42.600> fun<00:00:44.809> the

00:00:45.799 --> 00:00:45.809 
but the game itself is pretty fun the

00:00:45.809 --> 00:00:52.130 
but the game itself is pretty fun the
idea<00:00:46.200> is<00:00:48.140> you're<00:00:49.140> a<00:00:49.200> cattle<00:00:50.480> cattle<00:00:51.480> baron<00:00:51.930> in

in<00:01:18.060> your<00:01:18.090> way<00:01:18.950> let's<00:01:19.950> take<00:01:20.100> a<00:01:20.159> closer<00:01:20.640> look<00:01:20.820> at

00:01:21.140 --> 00:01:21.150 
in your way let's take a closer look at

00:01:21.150 --> 00:01:23.719 
in your way let's take a closer look at
the<00:01:21.360> board<00:01:21.600> okay<00:01:22.380> so<00:01:22.770> here's<00:01:23.009> the<00:01:23.130> board<00:01:23.369> for

00:01:23.719 --> 00:01:23.729 
the board okay so here's the board for

00:01:23.729 --> 00:01:28.810 
the board okay so here's the board for
this<00:01:23.909> sort<00:01:24.180> of<00:01:24.270> hybrid<00:01:25.020> euro<00:01:25.290> game<00:01:26.009> and

00:01:28.810 --> 00:01:28.820 

00:01:28.820 --> 00:01:32.890 

depending<00:01:29.820> on<00:01:29.939> how<00:01:30.180> many<00:01:30.240> players<00:01:31.110> you<00:01:31.259> have

00:01:32.890 --> 00:01:32.900 
depending on how many players you have

00:01:32.900 --> 00:01:35.420 
depending on how many players you have
there's<00:01:33.900> twelve<00:01:34.470> links<00:01:34.680> if<00:01:35.009> there's<00:01:35.220> five

00:01:35.420 --> 00:01:35.430 
there's twelve links if there's five

00:01:35.430 --> 00:01:37.390 
there's twelve links if there's five
players<00:01:35.729> it's<00:01:35.939> shortened<00:01:36.240> to<00:01:36.360> nine<00:01:36.570> and

00:01:37.390 --> 00:01:37.400 
players it's shortened to nine and

00:01:37.400 --> 00:01:40.069 
players it's shortened to nine and
there's<00:01:38.400> just<00:01:38.670> a<00:01:38.790> bit<00:01:39.030> initially<00:01:39.329> for<00:01:39.840> turn

00:01:40.069 --> 00:01:40.079 
there's just a bit initially for turn

00:01:40.079 --> 00:01:42.230 
there's just a bit initially for turn
order<00:01:40.560> which<00:01:41.130> is<00:01:41.369> pretty<00:01:41.579> important<00:01:42.150> because

00:01:42.230 --> 00:01:42.240 
order which is pretty important because

00:01:42.240 --> 00:01:44.899 
order which is pretty important because
each<00:01:42.600> player<00:01:42.899> has<00:01:42.930> two<00:01:43.350> actions<00:01:43.860> and<00:01:44.130> they're

00:01:44.899 --> 00:01:44.909 
each player has two actions and they're

00:01:44.909 --> 00:01:47.090 
each player has two actions and they're
constrained<00:01:45.450> in<00:01:45.930> what<00:01:46.229> they<00:01:46.350> can<00:01:46.409> build<00:01:46.799> I

00:01:47.090 --> 00:01:47.100 
constrained in what they can build I

00:01:47.100 --> 00:01:50.630 
constrained in what they can build I
find<00:01:48.030> the<00:01:48.899> game<00:01:49.140> and<00:01:49.470> this<00:01:49.920> mechanism<00:01:50.369> is<00:01:50.579> a

00:01:50.630 --> 00:01:50.640 
find the game and this mechanism is a

00:01:50.640 --> 00:01:52.580 
find the game and this mechanism is a
lot<00:01:50.880> better<00:01:51.149> with<00:01:51.329> five<00:01:51.570> players<00:01:51.990> because

00:01:52.580 --> 00:01:52.590 
lot better with five players because

00:01:52.590 --> 00:01:55.850 
lot better with five players because
there's<00:01:52.829> a<00:01:53.899> you<00:01:54.899> know<00:01:54.990> there's<00:01:55.290> less<00:01:55.470> you<00:01:55.680> can

00:01:55.850 --> 00:01:55.860 
there's a you know there's less you can

00:01:55.860 --> 00:01:57.740 
there's a you know there's less you can
do<00:01:56.070> because<00:01:56.340> most<00:01:56.909> the<00:01:57.060> actions<00:01:57.420> have<00:01:57.540> already

00:01:57.740 --> 00:01:57.750 
do because most the actions have already

00:01:57.750 --> 00:02:00.109 
do because most the actions have already
been<00:01:57.869> taken<00:01:58.049> up<00:01:58.350> here<00:01:58.680> so<00:01:59.430> with<00:01:59.549> three<00:01:59.820> players

00:02:00.109 --> 00:02:00.119 
been taken up here so with three players

00:02:00.119 --> 00:02:01.670 
been taken up here so with three players
you<00:02:00.420> feels<00:02:00.840> like<00:02:00.960> you<00:02:01.140> can<00:02:01.259> almost<00:02:01.380> do

00:02:01.670 --> 00:02:01.680 
you feels like you can almost do

00:02:01.680 --> 00:02:04.060 
you feels like you can almost do
everything<00:02:02.009> you<00:02:02.100> want<00:02:02.130> to<00:02:02.460> do<00:02:02.610> and<00:02:03.049> therefore

00:02:04.060 --> 00:02:04.070 
everything you want to do and therefore

00:02:04.070 --> 00:02:08.089 
everything you want to do and therefore
there's<00:02:05.070> no<00:02:05.219> tension<00:02:06.259> so<00:02:07.259> this<00:02:07.649> is<00:02:07.680> really

00:02:08.089 --> 00:02:08.099 
there's no tension so this is really

00:02:08.099 --> 00:02:09.240 
there's no tension so this is really
best<00:02:08.429> play<00:02:08.729> with<00:02:09.000> them

00:02:09.240 --> 00:02:09.250 
best play with them

00:02:09.250 --> 00:02:11.610 
best play with them
maximum<00:02:09.670> with<00:02:10.000> five<00:02:10.210> players<00:02:10.539> with<00:02:11.410> three

00:02:11.610 --> 00:02:11.620 
maximum with five players with three

00:02:11.620 --> 00:02:13.770 
maximum with five players with three
it's<00:02:11.890> not<00:02:12.040> a<00:02:12.070> lot<00:02:12.310> of<00:02:12.340> fun<00:02:12.580> five<00:02:13.090> that's<00:02:13.570> where

00:02:13.770 --> 00:02:13.780 
it's not a lot of fun five that's where

00:02:13.780 --> 00:02:17.790 
it's not a lot of fun five that's where
the<00:02:13.870> in<00:02:13.990> action<00:02:14.260> is<00:02:14.670> and<00:02:16.230> what<00:02:17.230> you<00:02:17.410> want<00:02:17.590> to<00:02:17.680> do

00:02:17.790 --> 00:02:17.800 
the in action is and what you want to do

00:03:08.040 --> 00:03:08.050 
dynamics a lot of negotiation when it

00:03:08.050 --> 00:03:10.140 
dynamics a lot of negotiation when it
comes<00:03:08.290> down<00:03:08.470> to<00:03:08.530> the<00:03:08.770> gunfights<00:03:09.310> it's<00:03:09.820> kind<00:03:10.120> of

00:03:10.140 --> 00:03:10.150 
comes down to the gunfights it's kind of

00:03:10.150 --> 00:03:12.240 
comes down to the gunfights it's kind of
like<00:03:10.270> an<00:03:10.420> OK<00:03:10.840> Corral<00:03:11.080> so<00:03:11.620> the<00:03:11.739> person<00:03:11.950> with<00:03:12.220> the

00:03:12.240 --> 00:03:12.250 
like an OK Corral so the person with the

00:03:12.250 --> 00:03:15.240 
like an OK Corral so the person with the
fewer<00:03:12.610> Cowboys<00:03:13.180> shoots<00:03:13.750> first<00:03:14.140> I<00:03:14.560> mean<00:03:15.010> isn't

00:03:15.240 --> 00:03:15.250 
fewer Cowboys shoots first I mean isn't

00:03:15.250 --> 00:03:17.759 
fewer Cowboys shoots first I mean isn't
it<00:03:15.400> like<00:03:15.790> every<00:03:16.120> great<00:03:16.299> cowboy<00:03:16.570> movie<00:03:17.080> you

00:03:17.759 --> 00:03:17.769 
it like every great cowboy movie you

00:03:17.769 --> 00:03:20.130 
it like every great cowboy movie you
always<00:03:18.070> got<00:03:18.190> to<00:03:18.340> give<00:03:18.519> the<00:03:19.480> underdog<00:03:19.840> is<00:03:20.019> a

00:03:20.130 --> 00:03:20.140 
always got to give the underdog is a

00:03:20.140 --> 00:03:23.100 
always got to give the underdog is a
fair<00:03:20.620> chance<00:03:21.090> so<00:03:22.090> the<00:03:22.330> president<00:03:22.690> the<00:03:22.900> fewer

00:03:23.100 --> 00:03:23.110 
fair chance so the president the fewer

00:03:23.110 --> 00:03:25.680 
fair chance so the president the fewer
Cowboys<00:03:23.590> rolls<00:03:24.190> first<00:03:24.670> and<00:03:25.000> if<00:03:25.299> they<00:03:25.420> make<00:03:25.660> any

00:03:25.680 --> 00:03:25.690 
Cowboys rolls first and if they make any

00:03:25.690 --> 00:03:29.580 
Cowboys rolls first and if they make any
hits<00:03:26.280> then<00:03:27.630> the<00:03:28.630> other<00:03:28.780> person's<00:03:29.080> Cowboys<00:03:29.440> are

00:03:29.580 --> 00:03:29.590 
hits then the other person's Cowboys are

00:03:29.590 --> 00:03:32.699 
hits then the other person's Cowboys are
eliminated<00:03:30.190> before<00:03:30.690> retaliating<00:03:31.690> so<00:03:32.350> it's<00:03:32.650> a

00:03:32.699 --> 00:03:32.709 
eliminated before retaliating so it's a

00:03:32.709 --> 00:03:37.710 
eliminated before retaliating so it's a
kind<00:03:32.830> of<00:03:32.920> a<00:03:33.010> neat<00:03:33.190> mechanism<00:03:35.730> the<00:03:36.730> only<00:03:37.120> thing

00:03:37.710 --> 00:03:37.720 
kind of a neat mechanism the only thing

00:03:37.720 --> 00:03:39.030 
kind of a neat mechanism the only thing
that<00:03:37.959> kind<00:03:38.200> of<00:03:38.260> doesn't<00:03:38.410> make<00:03:38.650> a<00:03:38.680> lot<00:03:38.860> of<00:03:38.920> sense

00:03:39.030 --> 00:03:39.040 
that kind of doesn't make a lot of sense

00:03:39.040 --> 00:03:41.670 
that kind of doesn't make a lot of sense
in<00:03:39.340> the<00:03:39.430> game<00:03:39.610> is<00:03:39.790> the<00:03:39.910> bank<00:03:40.410> you<00:03:41.410> know<00:03:41.500> it's

00:03:41.670 --> 00:03:41.680 
in the game is the bank you know it's

00:03:41.680 --> 00:03:44.729 
in the game is the bank you know it's
extremely<00:03:42.340> expensive<00:03:42.700> and<00:03:43.230> if<00:03:44.230> it's<00:03:44.440> robbed

00:03:44.729 --> 00:03:44.739 
extremely expensive and if it's robbed

00:03:44.739 --> 00:03:48.660 
extremely expensive and if it's robbed
you<00:03:45.010> pay<00:03:45.280> money<00:03:45.820> out<00:03:46.000> of<00:03:46.030> your<00:03:46.239> own<00:03:46.299> pocket<00:03:47.670> it

00:03:48.660 --> 00:03:48.670 
you pay money out of your own pocket it

00:03:48.670 --> 00:03:50.280 
you pay money out of your own pocket it
only<00:03:48.850> kind<00:03:49.090> of<00:03:49.120> makes<00:03:49.329> sense<00:03:49.450> as<00:03:49.660> a<00:03:49.690> late<00:03:50.049> in

00:03:50.280 --> 00:03:50.290 
only kind of makes sense as a late in

00:03:50.290 --> 00:03:53.430 
only kind of makes sense as a late in
game<00:03:51.510> when<00:03:52.510> you're<00:03:52.630> trying<00:03:52.780> to<00:03:52.870> increase<00:03:53.140> the

00:03:53.430 --> 00:03:53.440 
game when you're trying to increase the

00:03:53.440 --> 00:03:56.460 
game when you're trying to increase the
value<00:03:53.560> of<00:03:53.769> the<00:03:54.579> cities<00:03:54.989> because<00:03:55.989> the<00:03:56.200> the

00:03:56.460 --> 00:03:56.470 
value of the cities because the the

00:03:56.470 --> 00:03:59.430 
value of the cities because the the
points<00:03:56.829> scored<00:03:57.340> a<00:03:57.959> winning<00:03:58.959> of<00:03:59.049> the<00:03:59.079> game<00:03:59.260> are

00:03:59.430 --> 00:03:59.440 
points scored a winning of the game are

00:03:59.440 --> 00:04:03.360 
points scored a winning of the game are
based<00:03:59.680> on<00:03:59.920> how<00:04:00.700> large<00:04:01.000> the<00:04:01.299> city<00:04:01.540> is<00:04:02.100> so<00:04:03.100> then

00:04:03.360 --> 00:04:03.370 
based on how large the city is so then

00:04:03.370 --> 00:04:04.830 
based on how large the city is so then
you<00:04:03.519> might<00:04:03.670> want<00:04:03.700> to<00:04:03.910> throw<00:04:04.299> in<00:04:04.480> you<00:04:04.570> know<00:04:04.690> the

00:04:04.830 --> 00:04:04.840 
you might want to throw in you know the

00:04:04.840 --> 00:04:09.740 
you might want to throw in you know the
hotel<00:04:05.290> the<00:04:06.250> store<00:04:07.560> the<00:04:08.560> bank<00:04:08.799> and<00:04:09.040> whatnot

00:04:09.740 --> 00:04:09.750 
hotel the store the bank and whatnot

00:04:09.750 --> 00:04:12.330 
hotel the store the bank and whatnot
though<00:04:10.750> you're<00:04:10.959> limited<00:04:11.350> in<00:04:11.530> how<00:04:11.799> many<00:04:11.860> each

00:04:12.330 --> 00:04:12.340 
though you're limited in how many each

00:04:12.340 --> 00:04:14.400 
though you're limited in how many each
individual<00:04:13.030> player<00:04:13.239> can<00:04:13.480> build<00:04:13.690> in<00:04:13.930> the<00:04:14.140> city

00:04:14.400 --> 00:04:14.410 
individual player can build in the city

00:04:14.410 --> 00:04:18.390 
individual player can build in the city
it's<00:04:15.190> it's<00:04:15.880> pretty<00:04:16.209> fun<00:04:16.510> game<00:04:17.010> it's<00:04:18.010> really

00:04:18.390 --> 00:04:18.400 
it's it's pretty fun game it's really

00:04:18.400 --> 00:04:20.349 
it's it's pretty fun game it's really
best<00:04:18.580> with<00:04:18.820> five<00:04:19.060> players<00:04:19.419> because<00:04:19.780> of<00:04:19.930> the

00:04:20.349 --> 00:04:20.359 
best with five players because of the

00:04:20.359 --> 00:04:22.119 
best with five players because of the
transom<00:04:20.719> the<00:04:20.810> actions<00:04:21.229> and<00:04:21.379> then<00:04:21.680> the<00:04:21.919> bid

00:04:22.119 --> 00:04:22.129 
transom the actions and then the bid

00:04:22.129 --> 00:04:25.089 
transom the actions and then the bid
makes<00:04:22.430> a<00:04:22.550> lot<00:04:22.729> more<00:04:22.759> sense<00:04:23.560> it<00:04:24.560> can<00:04:24.830> play<00:04:25.039> in

00:04:25.089 --> 00:04:25.099 
makes a lot more sense it can play in

00:04:25.099 --> 00:04:29.379 
makes a lot more sense it can play in

00:04:29.379 --> 00:04:29.389 
about 90 minutes to two hours so it's a

00:04:29.389 --> 00:04:32.260 
about 90 minutes to two hours so it's a
fun<00:04:29.659> quick<00:04:30.169> game<00:04:30.469> I<00:04:30.830> really<00:04:31.550> like<00:04:31.759> it<00:04:32.000> there's

a enough lock in the dice rolling to

00:04:34.310 --> 00:04:35.830 
a enough lock in the dice rolling to
make<00:04:34.430> it<00:04:34.550> interesting<00:04:34.759> if<00:04:35.180> you're<00:04:35.330> strictly

00:04:35.830 --> 00:04:35.840 
make it interesting if you're strictly
