00:00:07.910 --> 00:00:11.759
 hello everyone knows flair and we get 

00:00:09.990 --> 00:00:14.610
 found today for a gameplay a 

00:00:11.759 --> 00:00:16.500
 good little gameplay on code 4 pc is 

00:00:14.610 --> 00:00:17.460
 true that it's a lot of demands 

00:00:16.500 --> 00:00:18.240
 is just everything that is 

00:00:17.460 --> 00:00:19.680
 old call of duty 

00:00:18.240 --> 00:00:21.240
 you want to see something other than 

00:00:19.680 --> 00:00:22.800
 kid necessarily you see the ghost 

00:00:21.240 --> 00:00:24.359
 why because it's the last one 

00:00:22.800 --> 00:00:26.160
 is out so we can not escape 

00:00:24.359 --> 00:00:27.869
 for the world rice ropes things 

00:00:26.160 --> 00:00:30.269
 like that we have to do 

00:00:27.869 --> 00:00:32.309
 of course it's part of that but 

00:00:30.269 --> 00:00:35.340
 blow a little gameplay on on another 

00:00:32.309 --> 00:00:37.380
 game on a good old code 4 and suddenly 

00:00:35.340 --> 00:00:39.360
 this topic of ironic comments 

00:00:37.380 --> 00:00:42.450
 the video lasts just over 4 minutes 

00:00:39.360 --> 00:00:44.430
 came instinctively enough I 

00:00:42.450 --> 00:00:45.230
 I'm told we're going to ask them what 

00:00:44.430 --> 00:00:48.450
 pleasure 

00:00:45.230 --> 00:00:49.489
 he finds turning back on the old 

00:00:48.450 --> 00:00:52.170
 call of duty 

00:00:49.489 --> 00:00:53.190
 so that necessarily low for ghost the 

00:00:52.170 --> 00:00:54.570
 question arises a little bit less 

00:00:53.190 --> 00:00:56.160
 because suddenly it's a game leaves 

00:00:54.570 --> 00:01:01.620
 which was pretty much neglected by the 

00:00:56.160 --> 00:01:03.960
 community and in the end 2-2 by the 

00:01:01.620 --> 00:01:06.030
 did that the game was left out of the 

00:01:03.960 --> 00:01:09.960
 community and ben actually you go from 

00:01:06.030 --> 00:01:11.100
 blow simply simply go back on 

00:01:09.960 --> 00:01:12.210
 the old call of duty to try to 

00:01:11.100 --> 00:01:14.280
 regain the pleasure you had 

00:01:12.210 --> 00:01:14.970
 before planes before ghost arrives in 

00:01:14.280 --> 00:01:16.590
 simply 

00:01:14.970 --> 00:01:17.729
 but I thought, I'm going to ask them 

00:01:16.590 --> 00:01:19.830
 a question that is going to be maybe a 

00:01:17.729 --> 00:01:22.830
 just a little bit more interesting 

00:01:19.830 --> 00:01:25.140
 what a pleasure you have to look at 

00:01:22.830 --> 00:01:27.180
 gameplay on old codes because 

00:01:25.140 --> 00:01:28.920
 go back there I understand but when you 

00:01:27.180 --> 00:01:31.350
 do not play that you just watch 

00:01:28.920 --> 00:01:32.670
 videos in addition to that you go to 

00:01:31.350 --> 00:01:34.590
 you're going to see he's gonna have really 

00:01:32.670 --> 00:01:36.540
 different style of play so there for 

00:01:34.590 --> 00:01:38.009
 the moment he does they are slowly advancing 

00:01:36.540 --> 00:01:40.680
 cautiously it takes a lot of time 

00:01:38.009 --> 00:01:41.850
 painted a lot of time skin not even he 

00:01:40.680 --> 00:01:43.409
 does not even time out there we have 

00:01:41.850 --> 00:01:44.100
 did a little early in the game but they 

00:01:43.409 --> 00:01:45.869
 advance cautiously 

00:01:44.100 --> 00:01:49.500
 they do not run in all directions and 

00:01:45.869 --> 00:01:50.880
 spa funds by jumping everywhere and 

00:01:49.500 --> 00:01:52.140
 I tell myself is not that what 

00:01:50.880 --> 00:01:53.939
 you also search on old 

00:01:52.140 --> 00:01:56.250
 call of duty ie everything 

00:01:53.939 --> 00:01:58.920
 simply nervous gameplay without 

00:01:56.250 --> 00:02:00.840
 necessarily people looking to 

00:01:58.920 --> 00:02:03.050
 make the big gameplay every time 

00:02:00.840 --> 00:02:05.870
 without necessarily doing a big guns sorting 

00:02:03.050 --> 00:02:07.280
 everything really a huge score the standards 

00:02:05.870 --> 00:02:09.229
 score will come as and when the 

00:02:07.280 --> 00:02:10.550
 part anyway you will see but 

00:02:09.229 --> 00:02:13.160
 I mean is it not at 

00:02:10.550 --> 00:02:15.410
 final nervousness someone running 

00:02:13.160 --> 00:02:17.330
 everywhere that pulls on pretty much everything 

00:02:15.410 --> 00:02:18.770
 who moves that you are looking for because 

00:02:17.330 --> 00:02:20.570
 it's really nice to watch you 

00:02:18.770 --> 00:02:21.950
 go see him on the second part there 

00:02:20.570 --> 00:02:23.630
 when he's going to die right now 

00:02:21.950 --> 00:02:24.830
 you will see last year we have 

00:02:23.630 --> 00:02:26.630
 the impression that it's downright 

00:02:24.830 --> 00:02:29.600
 other player so his style of play 

00:02:26.630 --> 00:02:30.410
 will change relative to compared to 

00:02:29.600 --> 00:02:31.910
 what you just saw 

00:02:30.410 --> 00:02:33.950
 and suddenly it's true that it's very 

00:02:31.910 --> 00:02:38.210
 nice to watch but in the end it goes 

00:02:33.950 --> 00:02:40.040
 still good 78 11 with 2 guns 

00:02:38.210 --> 00:02:40.610
 strict that seems to me more than 20 or more 

00:02:40.040 --> 00:02:42.350
 25 

00:02:40.610 --> 00:02:43.970
 so what is still not nothing 

00:02:42.350 --> 00:02:45.950
 which is still very very beautiful 

00:02:43.970 --> 00:02:47.390
 gameplay but I mean there is no 

00:02:45.950 --> 00:02:49.490
 the strict guen 

00:02:47.390 --> 00:02:51.250
 there is not a guy who lets go of me 

00:02:49.490 --> 00:02:53.990
 necessarily on 4 4 it is not possible 

00:02:51.250 --> 00:02:56.030
 but see what I mean is not 

00:02:53.990 --> 00:02:57.860
 a world record is not something 

00:02:56.030 --> 00:02:59.630
 something like that but here it is a big 

00:02:57.860 --> 00:03:01.910
 just just a good gameplay 

00:02:59.630 --> 00:03:04.550
 just a nice big gameplay to 

00:03:01.910 --> 00:03:06.530
 watch without necessarily the performance 

00:03:04.550 --> 00:03:07.880
 do you think I do? 

00:03:06.530 --> 00:03:09.440
 will interest us say it in the 

00:03:07.880 --> 00:03:10.630
 comments that would interest us 

00:03:09.440 --> 00:03:12.920
 strongly 

00:03:10.630 --> 00:03:14.239
 would you be interested in 

00:03:12.920 --> 00:03:16.880
 see also gameplay without necessarily 

00:03:14.239 --> 00:03:18.110
 performance like that but some 

00:03:16.880 --> 00:03:18.709
 gameplay where you are going to have some 

00:03:18.110 --> 00:03:20.390
 nervousness 

00:03:18.709 --> 00:03:22.280
 a guy who run around who shoots 

00:03:20.390 --> 00:03:23.810
 pretty much anything that moves kirch 

00:03:22.280 --> 00:03:24.470
 enemies has more power to know more 

00:03:23.810 --> 00:03:27.040
 what to do 

00:03:24.470 --> 00:03:29.480
 so hungry so much and rush what 

00:03:27.040 --> 00:03:31.640
 you will see with it has recovered a 

00:03:29.480 --> 00:03:32.900
 good dish will be on the party it's okay 

00:03:31.640 --> 00:03:34.130
 be a big killing ie it 

00:03:32.900 --> 00:03:36.800
 will take it he'll go for it on this pole 

00:03:34.130 --> 00:03:39.320
 and a half without any qualms and see he 

00:03:36.800 --> 00:03:40.730
 is already fifteen 15 killed in a row and 

00:03:39.320 --> 00:03:41.959
 yet he did that run he 

00:03:40.730 --> 00:03:44.000
 not specifically looking for 

00:03:41.959 --> 00:03:45.410
 performance but that's the kind of 

00:03:44.000 --> 00:03:47.330
 gameplay that I appreciate 

00:03:45.410 --> 00:03:50.000
 I love to watch who can not be 

00:03:47.330 --> 00:03:51.290
 realized on ben you have less of 

00:03:50.000 --> 00:03:51.970
 chance to make it on the last 

00:03:51.290 --> 00:03:53.840
 call of out 

00:03:51.970 --> 00:03:55.760
 why not because you have 

00:03:53.840 --> 00:03:57.800
 a lot of people so he's looking at 

00:03:55.760 --> 00:03:59.390
 play the gameplay inevitably necessarily 

00:03:57.800 --> 00:04:00.769
 because it's the last call of duty 

00:03:59.390 --> 00:04:02.810
 are world records that do not have 

00:04:00.769 --> 00:04:04.610
 still been established so they want 

00:04:02.810 --> 00:04:06.440
 set the world record I think 

00:04:04.610 --> 00:04:07.489
 and do big gameplay too for 

00:04:06.440 --> 00:04:08.840
 able to offer them to their subscribers 

00:04:07.489 --> 00:04:11.360
 so suddenly they are forced 

00:04:08.840 --> 00:04:14.060
 to play a little more carefully than 

00:04:11.360 --> 00:04:16.400
 now on this gameplay or suddenly 

00:04:14.060 --> 00:04:18.169
 Well, he has nothing to prove on side 4 

00:04:16.400 --> 00:04:20.239
 so that they can afford to 

00:04:18.169 --> 00:04:23.120
 run everywhere and offer us this pretty 

00:04:20.239 --> 00:04:25.460
 gameplay with a more than 70 he 178 

00:04:23.120 --> 00:04:27.020
 that he has 11 so gg to you punk he because 

00:04:25.460 --> 00:04:27.979
 that I had not yet if you 're really 

00:04:27.020 --> 00:04:29.090
 very nice gameplay I invite you 

00:04:27.979 --> 00:04:30.950
 really see them his chain and to us 

00:04:29.090 --> 00:04:32.720
 leave a max of like and a max of 

00:04:30.950 --> 00:04:34.070
 comments especially to interact with 

00:04:32.720 --> 00:04:37.360
 what I just told you about this 

00:04:34.070 --> 00:04:37.360
 tell you smart lease
