00:00:09.769 --> 00:00:14.539
 hello to all activity readers and 

00:00:12.199 --> 00:00:16.520
 font puntocom know what and in this 

00:00:14.539 --> 00:00:18.770
 We will show you all the videos 

00:00:16.520 --> 00:00:22.220
 news that we found in beta 4 

00:00:18.770 --> 00:00:25.070
 of them 8 released by apple makes a 

00:00:22.220 --> 00:00:28.279
 hours and we have to overtake before 

00:00:25.070 --> 00:00:30.469
 proceed to teach the improvements that in 

00:00:28.279 --> 00:00:33.440
 this beta we found dozens of improvements 

00:00:30.469 --> 00:00:36.379
 if we compare it with the third beta that 

00:00:33.440 --> 00:00:38.870
 came out two weeks ago at the moment so 

00:00:36.379 --> 00:00:41.000
 little that I have been able to prove it seems to me 

00:00:38.870 --> 00:00:45.280
 that has more stability than the third 

00:00:41.000 --> 00:00:46.960
 beta let's start by highlighting what 

00:00:45.280 --> 00:00:48.460
 this is one of the problems that has 

00:00:46.960 --> 00:00:50.079
 the vein that sometimes turns on the 

00:00:48.460 --> 00:00:52.180
 screen when we press but as I said 

00:00:50.079 --> 00:00:55.269
 let's start by highlighting that in this 

00:00:52.180 --> 00:00:57.039
 new beta of ios 8 has disappeared from 

00:00:55.269 --> 00:00:59.710
 the back reporter application that we 

00:00:57.039 --> 00:01:01.120
 allowed to send apple reports 

00:00:59.710 --> 00:01:03.909
 errors that were occurring with 

00:01:01.120 --> 00:01:06.670
 the betas this application appeared in the 

00:01:03.909 --> 00:01:09.909
 beta 128 as a native option that does not 

00:01:06.670 --> 00:01:14.000
 we could eliminate now in exchange for that 

00:01:09.909 --> 00:01:17.330
 apple application has introduced tips 

00:01:14.000 --> 00:01:20.240
 an application designed to learn the 

00:01:17.330 --> 00:01:22.130
 managing the news of them 8 apple 

00:01:20.240 --> 00:01:25.220
 wants users to face each other 

00:01:22.130 --> 00:01:28.190
 for the first time at 8 know of 

00:01:25.220 --> 00:01:31.369
 close all improvements and for that has 

00:01:28.190 --> 00:01:33.229
 introduced this guide here puts 

00:01:31.369 --> 00:01:36.710
 basically you can do more with your 

00:01:33.229 --> 00:01:39.970
 iphone and then learn apple tricks 

00:01:36.710 --> 00:01:39.970
 every week 

00:01:40.560 --> 00:01:46.079
 here we see how it tells us that we can 

00:01:43.290 --> 00:01:49.050
 respond quickly to a notification 

00:01:46.079 --> 00:01:54.230
 and for this it appears 

00:01:49.050 --> 00:01:54.230
 this gif that is loaded from internet 

00:01:55.570 --> 00:02:01.090
 here he notifies us he teaches us that now 

00:01:59.290 --> 00:02:03.729
 the email can notify us when there 

00:02:01.090 --> 00:02:06.580
 a new response as we have seen in 

00:02:03.729 --> 00:02:09.319
 previous sales also how it 

00:02:06.580 --> 00:02:12.079
 use siri 

00:02:09.319 --> 00:02:14.629
 how to use in the new option of 

00:02:12.079 --> 00:02:18.189
 voice recorder to send notes of 

00:02:14.629 --> 00:02:18.189
 voice over messages 

00:02:18.250 --> 00:02:23.500
 the new tactile gestures that 

00:02:20.470 --> 00:02:26.020
 we found in the native application of 

00:02:23.500 --> 00:02:28.120
 email that have appeared a few 

00:02:26.020 --> 00:02:30.520
 new as we taught you in your day in the 

00:02:28.120 --> 00:02:33.900
 first beta of them 8 in the video that 

00:02:30.520 --> 00:02:33.900
 we publish on iphone activity 

00:02:34.300 --> 00:02:39.820
 the new chronometer option to be able 

00:02:37.930 --> 00:02:41.710
 take a picture and we can 

00:02:39.820 --> 00:02:45.440
 set in 10 seconds in 3 seconds 

00:02:41.710 --> 00:02:47.540
 so that we are in the photo 

00:02:45.440 --> 00:02:49.220
 but one of the novelties that most 

00:02:47.540 --> 00:02:52.670
 have attracted attention has been the 

00:02:49.220 --> 00:02:55.820
 redesign as you can see control 

00:02:52.670 --> 00:02:59.540
 center now the edges disappear 

00:02:55.820 --> 00:03:01.400
 Black icons and colors are 

00:02:59.540 --> 00:03:03.980
 a little different we would like to know 

00:03:01.400 --> 00:03:07.130
 your opinion that you think this new 

00:03:03.980 --> 00:03:09.890
 control center design please leave 

00:03:07.130 --> 00:03:12.110
 your opinion in the comments 

00:03:09.890 --> 00:03:14.800
 going already to the adjustments we found 

00:03:12.110 --> 00:03:17.380
 new options 

00:03:14.800 --> 00:03:20.200
 the screen brightness that by the way 

00:03:17.380 --> 00:03:22.640
 has a new icon for the brightness of 

00:03:20.200 --> 00:03:24.950
 screen as you see 

00:03:22.640 --> 00:03:27.200
 that remains the same but with a 

00:03:24.950 --> 00:03:29.690
 new design and also allows us 

00:03:27.200 --> 00:03:32.550
 set from here 

00:03:29.690 --> 00:03:34.920
 text size 

00:03:32.550 --> 00:03:37.110
 and if we want it in bold but 

00:03:34.920 --> 00:03:39.990
 we are not going to do this for the 

00:03:37.110 --> 00:03:43.860
 moment also if we go to the option of 

00:03:39.990 --> 00:03:47.660
 privacy we find a new icon 

00:03:43.860 --> 00:03:50.460
 for home care that was not there before but 

00:03:47.660 --> 00:03:52.890
 surely of these developments we have 

00:03:50.460 --> 00:03:55.170
 to wait until the final release and 

00:03:52.890 --> 00:03:57.150
 possibly until the arrival of the 

00:03:55.170 --> 00:04:00.450
 iPhone 6 to see what is hidden behind 

00:03:57.150 --> 00:04:02.160
 of all this because surely apple 

00:04:00.450 --> 00:04:05.250
 prepares the surprises in the world of 

00:04:02.160 --> 00:04:06.930
 technology domotics that we can 

00:04:05.250 --> 00:04:08.880
 control through our iphone in 

00:04:06.930 --> 00:04:11.430
 the house at home and we continue 

00:04:08.880 --> 00:04:14.070
 staying in the settings section 

00:04:11.430 --> 00:04:17.519
 because in the messages we find 

00:04:14.070 --> 00:04:20.040
 New privacy options for 

00:04:17.519 --> 00:04:22.950
 audio messages that we send and we can 

00:04:20.040 --> 00:04:25.320
 select when we want them to expire 

00:04:22.950 --> 00:04:26.790
 and disappear we can choose to increase 

00:04:25.320 --> 00:04:29.689
 after two minutes of having it 

00:04:26.790 --> 00:04:32.209
 sent or never 

00:04:29.689 --> 00:04:34.669
 this not only happens with the 

00:04:32.209 --> 00:04:36.349
 Voice messages we send it 

00:04:34.669 --> 00:04:38.509
 it will also happen with voice messages 

00:04:36.349 --> 00:04:40.429
 that we receive, we are going to 

00:04:38.509 --> 00:04:42.369
 set in never to have them 

00:04:40.429 --> 00:04:44.360
 saved but of course that too 

00:04:42.369 --> 00:04:48.370
 will require more capacity 

00:04:44.360 --> 00:04:50.380
 physical storage on our iphone 

00:04:48.370 --> 00:04:53.740
 finally the section of adjustments and 

00:04:50.380 --> 00:04:56.290
 email we can access the options of 

00:04:53.740 --> 00:04:58.479
 the tactile gestures and here indicates us 

00:04:56.290 --> 00:05:00.250
 the gestures we can make and 

00:04:58.479 --> 00:05:02.350
 configure for when we are 

00:05:00.250 --> 00:05:05.260
 checking the email and managing it 

00:05:02.350 --> 00:05:07.000
 fastest way these are all the 

00:05:05.260 --> 00:05:09.990
 news that at the moment apple has 

00:05:07.000 --> 00:05:12.880
 introduced in the fourth beta of them 8 

00:05:09.990 --> 00:05:15.070
 we will be attentive to those who may come 

00:05:12.880 --> 00:05:18.360
 in beta 5 as always 

00:05:15.070 --> 00:05:18.360
 in activity as dotcom
