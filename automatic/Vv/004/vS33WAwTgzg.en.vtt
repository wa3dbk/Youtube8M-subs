00:00:23.900 --> 00:00:34.730
 I admire the howling moon that is up in the deep sky ah, mauve 

00:00:34.730 --> 00:00:44.800
 Their souls that sniff at the destroyed and scattered ruins, so, are screaming 

00:00:45.800 --> 00:00:50.500
 Two destinations living in the dark 

00:00:50.500 --> 00:00:52.200
 When my hand 

00:00:52.200 --> 00:00:53.560
 and my arm 

00:00:53.560 --> 00:00:56.260
 resonate with one another, now shake, shake 

00:00:56.300 --> 00:01:01.160
 The soul style of the wavelength that accelerates in macro 

00:01:01.460 --> 00:01:02.900
 To protect you 

00:01:02.900 --> 00:01:04.230
 I can become strong 

00:01:04.230 --> 00:01:06.760
 Peace and justice are the death of the rules 

00:01:06.760 --> 00:01:12.060
 The red spray is a noble blade 

00:01:12.500 --> 00:01:18.860
 When a connection has been created the wishes will be granted; fight! fight! 

00:01:32.200 --> 00:01:42.160
 I shake my tunic in the wind and tonight I'm running again. Oh I will not lose 

00:01:42.860 --> 00:01:52.930
 Come on, let's move forward without waiting; when I jump in the air it's exciting, so, I'm sorry 

00:01:53.860 --> 00:01:58.630
 Two destinations that yearn together 

00:01:59.030 --> 00:02:00.330
 If your eyes 

00:02:00.330 --> 00:02:01.560
 and your eyes 

00:02:01.560 --> 00:02:04.230
 They can believe in each other, shake, shake 

00:02:04.230 --> 00:02:09.230
 An invincible and great scythe jumps the mast 

00:02:09.530 --> 00:02:10.730
 Your courage 

00:02:10.730 --> 00:02:12.200
 will wake up 

00:02:12.200 --> 00:02:14.760
 The goddess of victory is death or life 

00:02:14.930 --> 00:02:20.030
 A blade where a black blast of blood boils 

00:02:20.400 --> 00:02:27.230
 When a connection is created, connect to sympathy, fight !, fight! 

00:02:49.800 --> 00:02:54.600
 Two destinations that share tears 

00:02:55.030 --> 00:02:56.260
 When my hand 

00:02:56.260 --> 00:02:57.500
 and my arm 

00:02:57.500 --> 00:03:00.260
 It becomes dreams now, shakes, shakes 

00:03:01.560 --> 00:03:06.630
 The soul style of the wavelength that accelerates in macro 

00:03:06.760 --> 00:03:08.160
 To protect you 

00:03:08.160 --> 00:03:09.500
 I can become strong 

00:03:09.500 --> 00:03:12.130
 Peace and justice are the death of the rules 

00:03:12.300 --> 00:03:17.430
 The red spray is a noble blade 

00:03:17.800 --> 00:03:24.630
 When a connection has been created the wishes will be granted; fight! fight!
