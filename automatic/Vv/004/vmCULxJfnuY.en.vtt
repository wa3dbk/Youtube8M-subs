armoring on the outside not only makes
the<00:01:56.950> binocular<00:01:57.400> very<00:01:57.580> comfortable<00:01:58.000> to<00:01:58.060> handle

00:01:58.560 --> 00:01:58.570 
the binocular very comfortable to handle

00:01:58.570 --> 00:02:00.630 
the binocular very comfortable to handle
and<00:01:59.049> I<00:01:59.140> think<00:01:59.200> looks<00:01:59.470> good<00:01:59.650> as<00:01:59.799> well<00:01:59.830> but<00:02:00.490> also

00:02:00.630 --> 00:02:00.640 
and I think looks good as well but also

00:02:00.640 --> 00:02:02.340 
and I think looks good as well but also
makes<00:02:00.939> the<00:02:01.030> binocular<00:02:01.509> totally<00:02:01.840> silent<00:02:02.080> in

00:02:02.340 --> 00:02:02.350 
makes the binocular totally silent in

makes the binocular totally silent in

still on a bit of the convenience and

00:03:18.530 --> 00:03:18.540 
compatibility of the x 25 we've got the

00:03:18.540 --> 00:03:20.540 
compatibility of the x 25 we've got the
832<00:03:19.020> here<00:03:19.440> it's<00:03:20.010> a<00:03:20.070> great<00:03:20.280> size<00:03:20.520> for

00:03:20.540 --> 00:03:20.550 
832 here it's a great size for

00:03:20.550 --> 00:03:22.699 
832 here it's a great size for
bird-watching<00:03:21.270> and<00:03:21.870> animal<00:03:22.290> watching<00:03:22.590> again

bird-watching and animal watching again

00:03:22.709 --> 00:03:25.280 
bird-watching and animal watching again
because<00:03:23.580> this<00:03:23.910> time<00:03:24.150> we've<00:03:24.540> got<00:03:24.570> 32

00:03:25.280 --> 00:03:25.290 
because this time we've got 32

00:03:25.290 --> 00:03:27.440 
because this time we've got 32
millimeter<00:03:25.680> from<00:03:26.070> optics<00:03:26.520> and<00:03:26.880> that's<00:03:27.120> just

00:03:27.440 --> 00:03:27.450 
millimeter from optics and that's just

00:03:27.450 --> 00:03:29.570 
millimeter from optics and that's just
enough<00:03:27.720> to<00:03:27.900> actually<00:03:28.050> give<00:03:28.410> you<00:03:28.530> a<00:03:28.590> good<00:03:28.980> poor

00:03:29.570 --> 00:03:29.580 
enough to actually give you a good poor

light performance out of the binocular

00:03:31.560 --> 00:03:33.470 
light performance out of the binocular
so<00:03:32.070> we've<00:03:32.340> got<00:03:32.520> some<00:03:32.730> of<00:03:32.820> the<00:03:32.880> advantages<00:03:33.150> of

00:03:33.470 --> 00:03:33.480 
so we've got some of the advantages of

00:03:33.480 --> 00:03:36.770 
so we've got some of the advantages of
the<00:03:33.810> x<00:03:34.080> 25<00:03:34.560> nice<00:03:35.520> and<00:03:35.760> compact<00:03:36.090> it's<00:03:36.510> small

00:03:36.770 --> 00:03:36.780 
the x 25 nice and compact it's small

Twilight performance and of course

00:03:48.930 --> 00:03:50.600 
Twilight performance and of course
that's<00:03:49.050> very<00:03:49.320> important<00:03:49.920> when<00:03:50.520> you're

00:03:50.600 --> 00:03:50.610 
that's very important when you're

00:03:50.610 --> 00:03:52.640 
that's very important when you're
looking<00:03:50.910> at<00:03:51.030> roosting<00:03:51.510> birds<00:03:51.750> and<00:03:52.260> that<00:03:52.410> kind

00:03:56.060 --> 00:03:56.070

focusing<00:05:57.700> can<00:05:57.880> we<00:05:57.940> actually<00:05:58.060> handle<00:05:58.479> with<00:05:58.600> one

00:05:58.620 --> 00:05:58.630

designed to be held in just one hand and
you<00:06:03.039> can<00:06:03.190> see<00:06:03.340> I<00:06:03.370> can<00:06:03.460> operate<00:06:03.850> the<00:06:04.000> focuser

00:06:04.500 --> 00:06:04.510 
you can see I can operate the focuser

00:06:04.510 --> 00:06:08.490 
you can see I can operate the focuser
very<00:06:05.169> easily<00:06:05.440> there<00:06:06.870> again<00:06:07.870> a<00:06:08.020> very<00:06:08.260> good

00:06:08.490 --> 00:06:08.500 
very easily there again a very good

00:06:10.350 --> 00:06:10.360 
compromise if you want to get a larger

00:06:10.360 --> 00:06:12.240 
compromise if you want to get a larger
optic<00:06:10.750> but<00:06:11.080> one<00:06:11.320> something<00:06:11.680> that<00:06:11.800> can<00:06:11.979> be<00:06:12.010> need

00:06:12.240 --> 00:06:12.250 
optic but one something that can be need

to carry around a monocular might be one

00:06:15.669 --> 00:06:18.240 
to carry around a monocular might be one
possible<00:06:16.060> solution<00:06:16.500> and<00:06:17.500> that's<00:06:17.710> the<00:06:17.860> Sahara

00:06:18.240 --> 00:06:18.250 
possible solution and that's the Sahara

00:06:18.250 --> 00:06:21.150 
possible solution and that's the Sahara
