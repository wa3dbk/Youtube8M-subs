00:01:39.200 --> 00:01:39.210 
would be really interesting I think

00:01:39.210 --> 00:01:41.330 
would be really interesting I think
before<00:01:39.600> we<00:01:40.079> get<00:01:40.320> too<00:01:40.560> far<00:01:40.590> along<00:01:41.070> in<00:01:41.250> this

00:01:41.330 --> 00:01:41.340 
before we get too far along in this

00:01:41.340 --> 00:01:44.300 
before we get too far along in this
process<00:01:41.640> if<00:01:42.030> maybe<00:01:42.299> the<00:01:42.600> council<00:01:43.170> did<00:01:43.890> a<00:01:43.920> study

00:01:44.300 --> 00:01:44.310 
process if maybe the council did a study

00:01:44.310 --> 00:01:46.670 
process if maybe the council did a study
or<00:01:44.430> had<00:01:44.939> someone<00:01:45.570> in<00:01:45.720> the<00:01:45.840> village<00:01:45.960> look<00:01:46.470> at

00:01:46.670 --> 00:01:46.680 
or had someone in the village look at

00:01:46.680 --> 00:01:49.399 
or had someone in the village look at
which<00:01:47.579> houses<00:01:47.909> have<00:01:48.360> been<00:01:48.600> torn<00:01:48.960> down<00:01:49.020> in<00:01:49.320> the

that live in the new houses do as well
it's<00:02:06.990> not<00:02:07.140> necessarily<00:02:07.590> a<00:02:08.280> bad<00:02:08.550> thing<00:02:08.610> well

00:02:09.139 --> 00:02:09.149 
it's not necessarily a bad thing well

it's<00:02:09.270> a<00:02:09.420> living<00:02:09.840> community<00:02:10.340> sometimes

the<00:02:12.170> parts<00:02:12.530> that<00:02:12.650> are<00:02:12.920> older<00:02:13.250> need<00:02:13.550> to<00:02:13.700> be

00:02:13.840 --> 00:02:13.850 
the parts that are older need to be

00:02:13.850 --> 00:02:16.330 
the parts that are older need to be
updated<00:02:14.090> and<00:02:14.630> replaced<00:02:15.020> and<00:02:15.410> I<00:02:15.890> just<00:02:16.130> think

00:02:16.330 --> 00:02:16.340 
updated and replaced and I just think

00:02:16.340 --> 00:02:18.580 
updated and replaced and I just think
that<00:02:16.490> if<00:02:16.760> you<00:02:17.060> you<00:02:17.810> should<00:02:17.990> take<00:02:18.140> a<00:02:18.170> look<00:02:18.410> at

00:02:18.580 --> 00:02:18.590 
that if you you should take a look at

00:02:18.590 --> 00:02:21.250 
that if you you should take a look at
what's<00:02:18.830> been<00:02:18.980> torn<00:02:19.550> down<00:02:19.640> and<00:02:20.210> decide<00:02:20.900> were

what's been torn down and decide were

00:02:21.260 --> 00:02:24.370 
what's been torn down and decide were

those really properties that you want to

00:02:24.380 --> 00:02:26.200 
those really properties that you want to

00:02:26.200 --> 00:02:26.210 
put so many restrictions on that we end

00:02:26.210 --> 00:02:30.700 
put so many restrictions on that we end
