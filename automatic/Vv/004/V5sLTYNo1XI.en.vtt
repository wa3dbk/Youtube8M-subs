00:00:30.259 --> 00:00:30.269 
be difficult to imagine eating for some

00:00:30.269 --> 00:00:31.939 
be difficult to imagine eating for some
people<00:00:30.539> because<00:00:30.810> having<00:00:31.140> the<00:00:31.289> broad<00:00:31.529> to<00:00:31.710> begin

00:00:31.939 --> 00:00:31.949 
people because having the broad to begin

00:00:31.949 --> 00:00:33.770 
people because having the broad to begin
with<00:00:32.099> and<00:00:32.340> not<00:00:32.730> mixing<00:00:33.239> them<00:00:33.420> up<00:00:33.510> or<00:00:33.630> anything

00:00:33.770 --> 00:00:33.780 
with and not mixing them up or anything

00:00:33.780 --> 00:00:35.900 
with and not mixing them up or anything
like<00:00:33.899> that<00:00:34.050> but<00:00:34.770> I<00:00:34.800> can<00:00:35.010> tell<00:00:35.219> you<00:00:35.340> the<00:00:35.430> kefir

00:00:35.900 --> 00:00:35.910 
like that but I can tell you the kefir

00:00:35.910 --> 00:00:38.479 
like that but I can tell you the kefir
overcomes<00:00:36.630> that<00:00:36.809> taste<00:00:37.350> now<00:00:38.040> the<00:00:38.160> reason<00:00:38.399> I

00:00:38.479 --> 00:00:38.489 
overcomes that taste now the reason I

00:00:38.489 --> 00:00:41.780 
overcomes that taste now the reason I
have<00:00:38.520> them<00:00:38.850> raw<00:00:39.059> is<00:00:39.450> because<00:00:40.410> it's<00:00:40.829> the<00:00:41.399> the

00:00:41.780 --> 00:00:41.790 
have them raw is because it's the the

00:00:41.790 --> 00:00:44.959 
have them raw is because it's the the
most<00:00:42.239> nutritious<00:00:42.960> way<00:00:43.200> to<00:00:43.680> eat<00:00:43.980> the<00:00:44.219> eggs<00:00:44.250> but

00:00:44.959 --> 00:00:44.969 
most nutritious way to eat the eggs but

00:00:55.100 --> 00:00:55.110 
do that and you'll see all the reasons

00:00:55.110 --> 00:00:56.720 
do that and you'll see all the reasons
why<00:00:55.289> but<00:00:55.559> one<00:00:55.829> caveat<00:00:56.100> is<00:00:56.309> they<00:00:56.460> have

00:00:56.720 --> 00:00:56.730 
why but one caveat is they have

00:00:56.730 --> 00:00:59.180 
why but one caveat is they have
absolutely<00:00:57.360> have<00:00:57.539> to<00:00:57.570> be<00:00:57.890> free-range<00:00:58.890> and

00:00:59.180 --> 00:00:59.190 
absolutely have to be free-range and

00:00:59.190 --> 00:01:01.580 
absolutely have to be free-range and
organic<00:00:59.850> and<00:01:00.030> it<00:01:00.090> basically<00:01:00.180> eliminates<00:01:01.020> the

00:01:01.580 --> 00:01:01.590 
organic and it basically eliminates the

organic and it basically eliminates the
possibility<00:01:02.219> of<00:01:02.250> Salmonella<00:01:02.820> in<00:01:03.030> there<00:01:03.239> now

00:01:03.619 --> 00:01:03.629 
possibility of Salmonella in there now

00:01:03.629 --> 00:01:05.690 
possibility of Salmonella in there now
if<00:01:03.780> you<00:01:03.870> absolutely<00:01:04.080> insist<00:01:04.500> on<00:01:05.070> cooking<00:01:05.580> them

00:01:05.690 --> 00:01:05.700 
if you absolutely insist on cooking them

00:01:05.700 --> 00:01:07.609 
if you absolutely insist on cooking them
the<00:01:05.820> best<00:01:06.000> way<00:01:06.180> to<00:01:06.210> do<00:01:06.420> is<00:01:06.659> to<00:01:06.990> do<00:01:07.170> the<00:01:07.350> least

00:01:07.609 --> 00:01:07.619 
the best way to do is to do the least

00:01:07.619 --> 00:01:10.130 
the best way to do is to do the least
amount<00:01:07.950> of<00:01:08.070> damage<00:01:08.280> to<00:01:08.820> the<00:01:08.970> yolks<00:01:09.240> that<00:01:09.869> would

00:01:10.130 --> 00:01:10.140 
amount of damage to the yolks that would

00:01:10.140 --> 00:01:12.980 
amount of damage to the yolks that would
be<00:01:10.229> soft-boiled<00:01:10.799> or<00:01:11.189> poached<00:01:11.640> just<00:01:12.540> eating

there is no cooking involved and there's
very<00:05:21.789> little<00:05:21.970> prep<00:05:22.330> since<00:05:22.599> most<00:05:22.810> of<00:05:22.990> this

00:05:23.159 --> 00:05:23.169 
very little prep since most of this

00:05:23.169 --> 00:05:26.100 
very little prep since most of this
stuff<00:05:23.380> is<00:05:23.530> done<00:05:23.770> people<00:05:24.340> also<00:05:24.729> ask<00:05:25.389> me<00:05:25.660> a<00:05:25.900> lot

00:05:26.100 --> 00:05:26.110 
stuff is done people also ask me a lot

00:05:26.110 --> 00:05:28.710 
stuff is done people also ask me a lot
if<00:05:26.320> I<00:05:26.410> like<00:05:26.650> juicing<00:05:27.160> and<00:05:27.370> I<00:05:27.940> actually<00:05:28.270> don't

00:05:28.710 --> 00:05:28.720 
if I like juicing and I actually don't

00:05:28.720 --> 00:05:30.990 
if I like juicing and I actually don't
mind<00:05:28.870> using<00:05:29.110> and<00:05:29.550> therefore<00:05:30.550> quite<00:05:30.760> a<00:05:30.789> few

00:05:30.990 --> 00:05:31.000 
mind using and therefore quite a few

00:05:31.000 --> 00:05:33.480 
mind using and therefore quite a few
reasons<00:05:31.180> to<00:05:31.630> begin<00:05:31.990> with<00:05:32.169> it's<00:05:32.800> a<00:05:33.010> lot<00:05:33.280> of

00:05:33.480 --> 00:05:33.490 
reasons to begin with it's a lot of

00:05:33.490 --> 00:05:35.279 
reasons to begin with it's a lot of
things<00:05:33.729> to<00:05:34.000> buy<00:05:34.150> a<00:05:34.180> lot<00:05:34.570> of<00:05:34.659> things<00:05:34.840> to<00:05:34.990> store

00:05:35.279 --> 00:05:35.289 
things to buy a lot of things to store

00:05:35.289 --> 00:05:37.379 
things to buy a lot of things to store
and<00:05:35.560> it's<00:05:35.860> a<00:05:35.949> lot<00:05:36.099> of<00:05:36.220> time<00:05:36.460> prepping<00:05:36.970> and

00:05:37.379 --> 00:05:37.389 
and it's a lot of time prepping and

00:05:37.389 --> 00:05:40.560 
and it's a lot of time prepping and
cleanup<00:05:38.050> and<00:05:39.060> the<00:05:40.060> other<00:05:40.330> thing<00:05:40.539> about

00:05:40.560 --> 00:05:40.570 
cleanup and the other thing about

00:05:40.570 --> 00:05:43.920 
cleanup and the other thing about
juicing<00:05:41.349> is<00:05:41.530> that<00:05:41.830> the<00:05:42.520> metal<00:05:43.030> blades<00:05:43.389> create

00:05:43.920 --> 00:05:43.930 
juicing is that the metal blades create

00:05:43.930 --> 00:05:46.920 
juicing is that the metal blades create
heat<00:05:44.470> and<00:05:44.710> it<00:05:45.580> burns<00:05:45.820> a<00:05:46.000> lot<00:05:46.150> of<00:05:46.300> the<00:05:46.389> enzymes

00:05:46.920 --> 00:05:46.930 
heat and it burns a lot of the enzymes

00:05:46.930 --> 00:05:49.260 
heat and it burns a lot of the enzymes
out<00:05:47.199> that<00:05:47.650> are<00:05:47.889> in<00:05:48.130> the<00:05:48.280> vegetables<00:05:48.789> unless

00:05:49.260 --> 00:05:49.270 
out that are in the vegetables unless

00:05:49.270 --> 00:05:51.180 
out that are in the vegetables unless
you're<00:05:49.539> buying<00:05:49.870> a<00:05:50.020> particular<00:05:50.349> juicer<00:05:51.010> that's

00:05:51.180 --> 00:05:51.190 
you're buying a particular juicer that's

00:05:51.190 --> 00:05:53.490 
you're buying a particular juicer that's
called<00:05:51.460> a<00:05:51.580> slow<00:05:51.849> juicer<00:05:52.060> that<00:05:52.750> specifically

00:05:53.490 --> 00:05:53.500 
called a slow juicer that specifically

00:05:53.500 --> 00:05:55.320 
called a slow juicer that specifically
doesn't<00:05:53.919> burn<00:05:54.250> out<00:05:54.430> the<00:05:54.580> enzymes<00:05:55.000> that's

00:05:55.320 --> 00:05:55.330 
doesn't burn out the enzymes that's

00:05:55.330 --> 00:05:56.879 
doesn't burn out the enzymes that's
what's<00:05:55.509> happening<00:05:55.930> you're<00:05:56.080> also<00:05:56.229> taking<00:05:56.560> out

00:05:56.879 --> 00:05:56.889 
what's happening you're also taking out

00:05:56.889 --> 00:06:00.120 
what's happening you're also taking out
the<00:05:57.430> fiber<00:05:57.759> that<00:05:58.449> is<00:05:58.870> in<00:05:59.229> the<00:05:59.440> vegetables<00:05:59.979> and

00:06:00.120 --> 00:06:00.130 
the fiber that is in the vegetables and

00:06:00.130 --> 00:06:01.260 
the fiber that is in the vegetables and
the<00:06:00.220> fiber<00:06:00.400> is<00:06:00.550> important<00:06:00.940> for<00:06:01.030> many<00:06:01.180> reasons

00:06:01.260 --> 00:06:01.270 
the fiber is important for many reasons

00:06:01.270 --> 00:06:03.120 
the fiber is important for many reasons
the<00:06:01.630> obvious<00:06:02.050> benefits<00:06:02.409> of<00:06:02.530> fiber<00:06:02.710> but<00:06:03.039> it

00:06:03.120 --> 00:06:03.130 
the obvious benefits of fiber but it

00:06:03.130 --> 00:06:05.249 
the obvious benefits of fiber but it
also<00:06:03.280> slows<00:06:03.759> it<00:06:04.060> down<00:06:04.110> within<00:06:05.110> your

00:06:05.249 --> 00:06:05.259 
also slows it down within your

00:06:05.259 --> 00:06:07.409 
also slows it down within your
intestines<00:06:05.830> allowing<00:06:06.460> your<00:06:06.610> body<00:06:06.759> to<00:06:06.940> absorb

00:06:07.409 --> 00:06:07.419 
intestines allowing your body to absorb

00:06:07.419 --> 00:06:08.939 
intestines allowing your body to absorb
a<00:06:07.509> lot<00:06:07.659> of<00:06:07.690> the<00:06:07.870> nutrients<00:06:08.320> that<00:06:08.500> are<00:06:08.650> in<00:06:08.680> there

00:06:08.939 --> 00:06:08.949 
a lot of the nutrients that are in there

00:06:08.949 --> 00:06:11.100 
a lot of the nutrients that are in there
so<00:06:09.639> you<00:06:09.699> can<00:06:10.000> save<00:06:10.270> yourself<00:06:10.599> a<00:06:10.659> lot<00:06:10.780> of<00:06:10.840> time

00:06:11.100 --> 00:06:11.110 
so you can save yourself a lot of time

00:06:11.110 --> 00:06:14.270 
so you can save yourself a lot of time
energy<00:06:11.409> and<00:06:11.620> money<00:06:11.740> by<00:06:12.070> not<00:06:12.280> using<00:06:12.550> and<00:06:13.060> just

00:06:14.270 --> 00:06:14.280 
energy and money by not using and just

00:06:14.280 --> 00:06:16.680 
energy and money by not using and just
actually<00:06:15.280> eat<00:06:15.430> the<00:06:15.580> vegetables<00:06:16.060> I<00:06:16.270> hope

00:06:16.680 --> 00:06:16.690 
actually eat the vegetables I hope
