00:00:13.790 --> 00:00:17.820
 so hallihallo and welcome to here 

00:00:16.859 --> 00:00:19.980
 bernburg 

00:00:17.820 --> 00:00:22.260
 Today I want to give you my new currency 

00:00:19.980 --> 00:00:27.480
 I have imagined that 

00:00:22.260 --> 00:00:31.369
 made a pawn to gtx 770 with 

00:00:27.480 --> 00:00:35.420
 a 104 keppler gpu cores 

00:00:31.369 --> 00:00:39.329
 what has to do or take a look 

00:00:35.420 --> 00:00:43.230
 two gigabyte version 4 worked 

00:00:39.329 --> 00:00:45.840
 Unfortunately I do not get to have such a thing 

00:00:43.230 --> 00:00:48.450
 we all have features that the opus 2 does 

00:00:45.840 --> 00:00:53.280
 means the speed is 

00:00:48.450 --> 00:00:55.260
 is automatically regulated more or 

00:00:53.280 --> 00:01:01.469
 less adapted to the situation 

00:00:55.260 --> 00:01:04.860
 means up to 1.25 ghz she can 

00:01:01.469 --> 00:01:07.340
 you can see it turned up 

00:01:04.860 --> 00:01:10.430
 graphics I hope in the camera yet 

00:01:07.340 --> 00:01:12.720
 instead of a five-phase 

00:01:10.430 --> 00:01:16.500
 she has a power supply 

00:01:12.720 --> 00:01:19.140
 eight weeks what a more stable blabla there 

00:01:16.500 --> 00:01:22.259
 is quite as my rule dictates the 

00:01:19.140 --> 00:01:23.430
 I can keep the voltage stable 

00:01:22.259 --> 00:01:25.430
 I do not tell you either 

00:01:23.430 --> 00:01:30.030
 experience still with this map 

00:01:25.430 --> 00:01:35.030
 what's new or old is new 

00:01:30.030 --> 00:01:38.189
 famous phantom cooling system at gtx 

00:01:35.030 --> 00:01:41.280
 570 so that was the phantom series 

00:01:38.189 --> 00:01:45.600
 she has extremely good knowledge of the 

00:01:41.280 --> 00:01:49.229
 ranges from version 6 180 or 580 6 

00:01:45.600 --> 00:01:50.729
 80 countries was then or has the people 

00:01:49.229 --> 00:01:52.340
 not so excited anymore because she is not 

00:01:50.729 --> 00:01:55.799
 this achievement brought 

00:01:52.340 --> 00:01:59.549
 This system is supposedly now 

00:01:55.799 --> 00:02:01.469
 as new rebuilt outside the 1 2 0 1 

00:01:59.549 --> 00:02:04.439
 to have stayed at old but that 

00:02:01.469 --> 00:02:05.640
 interior life means and therefore 

00:02:04.439 --> 00:02:08.869
 Write it is great now too 

00:02:05.640 --> 00:02:10.000
 it should be up to 60 percent less 

00:02:08.869 --> 00:02:13.660
 volume 

00:02:10.000 --> 00:02:14.860
 But I have 15 students for that 

00:02:13.660 --> 00:02:17.610
 I do not know yet, I let myself 

00:02:14.860 --> 00:02:21.040
 surprise well 

00:02:17.610 --> 00:02:32.620
 look what have it all 

00:02:21.040 --> 00:02:35.400
 provides accuse the manufacturer with everything 

00:02:32.620 --> 00:02:35.400
 Let's get into the round 

00:02:45.849 --> 00:02:51.079
 Here we have the good piece his 

00:02:48.920 --> 00:02:56.739
 Vice are still all well welded 

00:02:51.079 --> 00:02:59.629
 and if one gets the monster get out 

00:02:56.739 --> 00:03:03.379
 one at once on no fans 

00:02:59.629 --> 00:03:05.989
 typical phantom why are they 

00:03:03.379 --> 00:03:08.150
 I will show you more in detail 

00:03:05.989 --> 00:03:12.769
 width one sits now pretty nice 

00:03:08.150 --> 00:03:15.829
 a slot 2 slot 2 1 half loud dhs 

00:03:12.769 --> 00:03:19.010
 Leitbetrieb in the installation could 

00:03:15.829 --> 00:03:21.739
 of course , forgetting would be a bigger one 

00:03:19.010 --> 00:03:24.530
 portman has no problem with that 

00:03:21.739 --> 00:03:25.099
 two graphics cards of this kind no 

00:03:24.530 --> 00:03:27.169
 problem 

00:03:25.099 --> 00:03:34.189
 turns the rows is a bit 

00:03:27.169 --> 00:03:36.439
 warm good here again, heat twice dvi 

00:03:34.189 --> 00:03:40.010
 exits once hdmi and once 

00:03:36.439 --> 00:03:43.129
 displayport that is a maximum of four 

00:03:40.010 --> 00:03:45.620
 monitors on this card and now too 

00:03:43.129 --> 00:03:47.269
 this little good that the card has 

00:03:45.620 --> 00:03:50.599
 I hope you will see that I will 

00:03:47.269 --> 00:03:53.299
 The more it stops up here has the 

00:03:50.599 --> 00:03:57.109
 card so randall screws 

00:03:53.299 --> 00:04:01.189
 he pulls me well up here you can 

00:03:57.109 --> 00:04:06.439
 namely to make falls you just hold me 

00:04:01.189 --> 00:04:11.479
 show it to you now and there 

00:04:06.439 --> 00:04:13.090
 you can remove the fan what the 

00:04:11.479 --> 00:04:17.299
 advantage when cleaning 

00:04:13.090 --> 00:04:19.639
 I came to separate them more easily 

00:04:17.299 --> 00:04:21.220
 we look at it is already halfpipes 

00:04:19.639 --> 00:04:23.960
 followed here 

00:04:21.220 --> 00:04:28.509
 and if you look a bit on the 

00:04:23.960 --> 00:04:34.040
 the other side lies he also sows in there 

00:04:28.509 --> 00:04:35.870
 Here are big heat sinks 

00:04:34.040 --> 00:04:38.080
 and indeed they have is actually 

00:04:35.870 --> 00:04:41.090
 made and have again the 

00:04:38.080 --> 00:04:44.570
 memory modules with cooled what 

00:04:41.090 --> 00:04:45.260
 means the fans are like that 

00:04:44.570 --> 00:04:49.820
 built-in 

00:04:45.260 --> 00:04:52.790
 They suck the air over the heat sink 

00:04:49.820 --> 00:04:55.130
 and blow in addition but also 

00:04:52.790 --> 00:04:57.380
 still on the interior what a 

00:04:55.130 --> 00:05:01.940
 should promise additional cooling 

00:04:57.380 --> 00:05:03.800
 I would like to have good practice as it is 

00:05:01.940 --> 00:05:08.350
 I can not tell you yet 

00:05:03.800 --> 00:05:11.030
 I have not installed it yet 

00:05:08.350 --> 00:05:13.370
 otherwise what else do we have the standard 

00:05:11.030 --> 00:05:16.760
 electricity connections once six structurally 

00:05:13.370 --> 00:05:19.820
 Eight eight times and that's us 

00:05:16.760 --> 00:05:22.460
 even barakat he has failed 

00:05:19.820 --> 00:05:25.610
 they now optically nothing to offer 

00:05:22.460 --> 00:05:26.290
 typical fans is design i like it 

00:05:25.610 --> 00:05:31.150
 very well 

00:05:26.290 --> 00:05:32.780
 god what is there still accessories 

00:05:31.150 --> 00:05:38.840
 Let's take a look 

00:05:32.780 --> 00:05:41.740
 we can give that away again because what 

00:05:38.840 --> 00:05:48.350
 did not come up with much 

00:05:41.740 --> 00:05:52.910
 typical while the power connections nothing 

00:05:48.350 --> 00:05:59.290
 exciting then once hdmi on dvi 

00:05:52.910 --> 00:06:03.620
 adapter and 1 x hdmi to vga adapter 

00:05:59.290 --> 00:06:07.730
 then we have a gamers 3 cd where 

00:06:03.620 --> 00:06:13.550
 Also this software is the new order and 

00:06:07.730 --> 00:06:16.100
 last but not least in manual as usual 

00:06:13.550 --> 00:06:18.080
 I already noticed that here 

00:06:16.100 --> 00:06:19.720
 I saw through it, I show 

00:06:18.080 --> 00:06:23.030
 Take a look at it 

00:06:19.720 --> 00:06:25.460
 it is a completely different card and 

00:06:23.030 --> 00:06:29.570
 everyone is pictured because there is still one 

00:06:25.460 --> 00:06:32.570
 a vga hdmi and vga dvi and hdmi 

00:06:29.570 --> 00:06:36.910
 inside and will follow 

00:06:32.570 --> 00:06:36.910
 namely, somewhere I have the most 

00:06:36.949 --> 00:06:42.870
 570 does not refer to the description 

00:06:40.590 --> 00:06:45.389
 So here we have to go a bit 

00:06:42.870 --> 00:06:47.099
 watch water wherever you go and fall 

00:06:45.389 --> 00:06:49.800
 this is very much her 

00:06:47.099 --> 00:06:54.900
 Driving licenses live in the description 

00:06:49.800 --> 00:06:55.860
 shattering is recommended a fourth 400 

00:06:54.900 --> 00:07:00.840
 watt power supply 

00:06:55.860 --> 00:07:04.259
 here it is but she means that 

00:07:00.840 --> 00:07:05.129
 map we should have at least a 600 

00:07:04.259 --> 00:07:07.139
 gone 

00:07:05.129 --> 00:07:09.330
 It is on the packaging 

00:07:07.139 --> 00:07:11.099
 so it is always men on it he is 

00:07:09.330 --> 00:07:13.560
 now exactly at this instructions halt 

00:07:11.099 --> 00:07:15.590
 and 1 400 waiting now can stop 

00:07:13.560 --> 00:07:19.530
 that happen to him the power supply 

00:07:15.590 --> 00:07:21.840
 blow it out okay that's it from me 

00:07:19.530 --> 00:07:24.569
 once you show at the end the 

00:07:21.840 --> 00:07:27.659
 This card is in full again 

00:07:24.569 --> 00:07:30.779
 I'll ask for this video 

00:07:27.659 --> 00:07:32.490
 go and build the sweet card and 

00:07:30.779 --> 00:07:35.069
 the first time the benchmarks run 

00:07:32.490 --> 00:07:37.919
 leave and get those results then 

00:07:35.069 --> 00:07:42.000
 and I'll tell you the results 

00:07:37.919 --> 00:07:45.469
 then post in the postings 

00:07:42.000 --> 00:07:48.360
 if you like trees up high 

00:07:45.469 --> 00:07:50.340
 and further wanted to stay tuned let 

00:07:48.360 --> 00:07:51.539
 just an abo da by then I wish 

00:07:50.340 --> 00:07:54.629
 Have a nice day 

00:07:51.539 --> 00:07:57.199
 here is murder of 14 marx until then 

00:07:54.629 --> 00:07:57.199
 Georgia
