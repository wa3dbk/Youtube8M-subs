00:00:22.630 --> 00:00:22.640 
beat up and in there competing hard

00:00:22.640 --> 00:00:24.040 
beat up and in there competing hard
against<00:00:22.939> each<00:00:23.060> other<00:00:23.300> and<00:00:23.390> then<00:00:23.689> you<00:00:23.960> know

00:00:24.040 --> 00:00:24.050 
against each other and then you know

00:00:24.050 --> 00:00:26.470 
against each other and then you know
guys<00:00:24.980> start<00:00:25.279> keeping<00:00:25.550> score<00:00:25.820> to<00:00:26.000> an<00:00:26.090> extent

00:00:26.470 --> 00:00:26.480 
guys start keeping score to an extent

00:00:26.480 --> 00:00:28.269 
guys start keeping score to an extent
this<00:00:26.600> guy<00:00:26.810> pushed<00:00:27.080> him<00:00:27.320> or<00:00:27.560> that<00:00:27.650> whatever<00:00:28.070> and

00:00:28.269 --> 00:00:28.279 
this guy pushed him or that whatever and

00:00:28.279 --> 00:00:30.519 
this guy pushed him or that whatever and
so<00:00:28.400> we<00:00:28.519> just<00:00:28.730> had<00:00:29.060> to<00:00:29.240> add<00:00:29.810> a<00:00:29.840> little<00:00:30.050> flair<00:00:30.349> up

00:00:30.519 --> 00:00:30.529 
so we just had to add a little flair up

00:00:30.529 --> 00:00:32.080 
so we just had to add a little flair up
we<00:00:30.679> got<00:00:30.830> past<00:00:31.039> it<00:00:31.340> and<00:00:31.369> what<00:00:31.550> we'll<00:00:31.730> move<00:00:31.880> on

00:00:32.080 --> 00:00:32.090 
we got past it and what we'll move on

00:00:32.090 --> 00:00:35.229 
we got past it and what we'll move on
and<00:00:32.390> you<00:00:32.570> know<00:00:33.080> learn<00:00:33.260> from<00:00:33.500> it<00:00:33.680> but<00:00:34.150> you<00:00:35.150> know

00:00:35.229 --> 00:00:35.239 
and you know learn from it but you know

00:00:35.239 --> 00:00:39.789 
and you know learn from it but you know
as<00:00:35.390> I<00:00:35.510> said<00:00:35.720> before<00:00:37.570> you<00:00:38.570> know<00:00:38.720> I<00:00:39.019> think<00:00:39.589> it's<00:00:39.710> a

00:00:39.789 --> 00:00:39.799 
as I said before you know I think it's a

00:00:39.799 --> 00:00:41.439 
as I said before you know I think it's a
positive<00:00:40.010> sign<00:00:40.519> we've<00:00:40.909> got<00:00:41.030> to<00:00:41.120> learn<00:00:41.210> how<00:00:41.269> to

00:00:41.439 --> 00:00:41.449 
positive sign we've got to learn how to

00:00:41.449 --> 00:00:43.660 
positive sign we've got to learn how to
handle<00:00:41.809> it<00:00:41.960> but<00:00:42.769> it's<00:00:42.949> positive<00:00:43.460> that<00:00:43.580> our

00:00:43.660 --> 00:00:43.670 
handle it but it's positive that our

00:00:43.670 --> 00:00:45.820 
handle it but it's positive that our
guys<00:00:43.879> you<00:00:44.600> know<00:00:44.720> care<00:00:45.049> and<00:00:45.229> compete<00:00:45.530> against

00:00:45.820 --> 00:00:45.830 
guys you know care and compete against

00:00:45.830 --> 00:00:46.869 
guys you know care and compete against
each<00:00:45.890> other<00:00:46.159> now<00:00:46.280> they've<00:00:46.430> got<00:00:46.580> to<00:00:46.699> learn<00:00:46.820> to

00:00:46.869 --> 00:00:46.879 
each other now they've got to learn to

00:00:46.879 --> 00:00:48.820 
each other now they've got to learn to
keep<00:00:47.809> their<00:00:47.989> emotions<00:00:48.049> a<00:00:48.470> little<00:00:48.500> more<00:00:48.739> in

00:00:48.820 --> 00:00:48.830 
keep their emotions a little more in

00:00:48.830 --> 00:00:51.939 
keep their emotions a little more in
check<00:00:49.070> but<00:00:49.430> but<00:00:49.879> that's<00:00:50.409> yeah<00:00:51.409> that's<00:00:51.440> part<00:00:51.890> of

00:00:51.939 --> 00:00:51.949 
check but but that's yeah that's part of

00:00:51.949 --> 00:00:54.189 
check but but that's yeah that's part of
the<00:00:52.040> process<00:00:52.190> and<00:00:52.610> fists<00:00:53.299> at<00:00:53.600> helmets<00:00:53.900> aren't

00:00:54.189 --> 00:00:54.199 
the process and fists at helmets aren't

00:00:54.199 --> 00:00:55.719 
the process and fists at helmets aren't
exactly<00:00:54.440> going<00:00:54.559> to<00:00:54.680> help<00:00:54.830> the<00:00:54.920> healthy<00:00:55.190> no<00:00:55.369> no

00:00:55.719 --> 00:00:55.729

as<00:00:55.879> smart<00:00:56.119> as<00:00:56.239> our<00:00:56.390> guys<00:00:56.570> are<00:00:56.839> sometimes<00:00:57.199> they

00:00:57.689 --> 00:00:57.699 
as smart as our guys are sometimes they

00:00:57.699 --> 00:00:59.590 
as smart as our guys are sometimes they
not<00:00:58.699> sure<00:00:58.850> that<00:00:59.000> they<00:00:59.089> understand<00:00:59.479> that

00:00:59.590 --> 00:00:59.600 
not sure that they understand that

00:00:59.600 --> 00:01:02.109 
not sure that they understand that
that's<00:00:59.780> not<00:00:59.989> a<00:01:00.019> winning<00:01:00.650> proposition<00:01:01.059> do<00:01:02.059> you

00:01:02.109 --> 00:01:02.119 
that's not a winning proposition do you

00:01:02.119 --> 00:01:03.850 
that's not a winning proposition do you
have<00:01:02.210> a<00:01:02.269> sense<00:01:02.449> for<00:01:02.570> that<00:01:03.260> the<00:01:03.350> defense's

00:01:03.850 --> 00:01:03.860 
have a sense for that the defense's

00:01:03.860 --> 00:01:06.460 
have a sense for that the defense's
found<00:01:04.220> it<00:01:04.369> hard<00:01:04.610> to<00:01:04.760> wait<00:01:05.030> over<00:01:05.600> a<00:01:05.900> week<00:01:06.110> to<00:01:06.140> get

00:01:06.460 --> 00:01:06.470 
found it hard to wait over a week to get

00:01:06.470 --> 00:01:09.670 
found it hard to wait over a week to get
get<00:01:07.130> the<00:01:07.159> hit<00:01:07.400> really<00:01:08.150> good<00:01:08.299> yeah<00:01:08.840> I<00:01:08.870> think<00:01:09.350> so

00:01:13.100 --> 00:01:15.280 
it is we'll see i mean you know that's
the<00:01:13.430> hope<00:01:13.910> i<00:01:14.180> hope<00:01:14.330> that's<00:01:14.570> the<00:01:14.810> deal<00:01:14.960> I'm<00:01:15.170> I

00:01:15.280 --> 00:01:15.290 
the hope i hope that's the deal I'm I

00:01:15.290 --> 00:01:16.630 
the hope i hope that's the deal I'm I
hope<00:01:15.470> they're<00:01:15.680> anxious<00:01:15.950> to<00:01:16.250> get<00:01:16.340> out<00:01:16.430> there

00:01:16.630 --> 00:01:16.640 
hope they're anxious to get out there

00:01:16.640 --> 00:01:19.840 
hope they're anxious to get out there
and<00:01:16.850> and<00:01:17.590> you<00:01:18.590> know<00:01:18.680> make<00:01:18.860> place<00:01:19.070> tomorrow<00:01:19.460> you

00:01:19.840 --> 00:01:19.850 
and and you know make place tomorrow you

00:01:19.850 --> 00:01:23.050 
and and you know make place tomorrow you
know<00:01:19.970> and<00:01:20.390> I<00:01:20.780> think<00:01:21.350> it's<00:01:21.500> a<00:01:21.590> combination<00:01:21.890> of<00:01:22.370> a

00:01:23.050 --> 00:01:23.060 
know and I think it's a combination of a

00:01:23.060 --> 00:01:24.760 
know and I think it's a combination of a
lot<00:01:23.660> of<00:01:23.840> things<00:01:24.110> but<00:01:24.200> I<00:01:24.290> think<00:01:24.470> that's<00:01:24.590> one<00:01:24.740> of

00:01:24.760 --> 00:01:24.770 
lot of things but I think that's one of

00:01:24.770 --> 00:01:26.860 
lot of things but I think that's one of
them<00:01:25.010> this<00:01:25.160> is<00:01:25.550> you<00:01:26.300> know<00:01:26.420> what<00:01:26.570> we<00:01:26.690> need<00:01:26.810> to

00:01:26.860 --> 00:01:26.870 
them this is you know what we need to

00:01:26.870 --> 00:01:28.360 
them this is you know what we need to
have<00:01:27.020> a<00:01:27.050> scrimmage<00:01:27.380> we<00:01:27.650> need<00:01:27.740> to<00:01:27.800> let<00:01:27.890> guys<00:01:28.070> hit

00:01:28.360 --> 00:01:28.370 
have a scrimmage we need to let guys hit

00:01:28.370 --> 00:01:32.230 
have a scrimmage we need to let guys hit
and<00:01:28.580> mix<00:01:29.240> it<00:01:29.360> up<00:01:29.450> a<00:01:29.570> little<00:01:29.600> bit<00:01:30.010> and<00:01:31.010> I<00:01:31.370> you

00:01:32.230 --> 00:01:32.240 
and mix it up a little bit and I you

00:01:32.240 --> 00:01:33.880 
and mix it up a little bit and I you
know<00:01:32.330> it'll<00:01:32.630> be<00:01:32.690> a<00:01:32.720> positive<00:01:32.930> force<00:01:33.170> Oh<00:01:33.500> Team

00:01:39.430 --> 00:01:39.440 
that's something that we knew was going

00:01:39.440 --> 00:01:41.560 
that's something that we knew was going
to<00:01:39.530> be<00:01:39.620> a<00:01:39.650> process<00:01:40.130> i<00:01:40.250> mean<00:01:40.370> that's<00:01:40.520> you<00:01:41.450> know

00:01:41.560 --> 00:01:41.570 
to be a process i mean that's you know

00:01:41.570 --> 00:01:45.610 
to be a process i mean that's you know
we've<00:01:42.500> done<00:01:42.770> we've<00:01:43.550> done<00:01:43.820> a<00:01:44.120> lot<00:01:44.510> of<00:01:44.720> things<00:01:45.050> to

we've done we've done a lot of things to

00:01:45.620 --> 00:01:48.670 
we've done we've done a lot of things to
improve<00:01:46.220> our<00:01:46.550> team<00:01:47.360> and<00:01:47.870> we<00:01:48.140> still<00:01:48.380> have<00:01:48.530> to

00:01:48.670 --> 00:01:48.680 
improve our team and we still have to

00:01:48.680 --> 00:01:50.890 
improve our team and we still have to
continue<00:01:49.070> to<00:01:49.190> do<00:01:49.340> that<00:01:49.550> and<00:01:50.210> that

00:01:50.890 --> 00:01:50.900 
continue to do that and that

00:01:50.900 --> 00:01:53.649 
continue to do that and that
unfortunately<00:01:51.500> building<00:01:52.370> a<00:01:52.460> team<00:01:52.820> of<00:01:53.030> 105

00:01:53.649 --> 00:01:53.659 
unfortunately building a team of 105

00:01:53.659 --> 00:01:57.160 
unfortunately building a team of 105
people<00:01:54.290> is<00:01:54.710> a<00:01:54.740> process<00:01:55.479> it's<00:01:56.479> not<00:01:56.720> a<00:01:56.780> there's

00:01:57.160 --> 00:01:57.170 
people is a process it's not a there's

00:01:57.170 --> 00:01:58.600 
people is a process it's not a there's
not<00:01:57.290> a<00:01:57.320> magic<00:01:57.560> potion<00:01:57.920> there's<00:01:58.430> a<00:01:58.460> lot<00:01:58.580> of

00:01:58.600 --> 00:01:58.610 
not a magic potion there's a lot of

00:01:58.610 --> 00:02:01.870 
not a magic potion there's a lot of
something<00:01:59.060> that<00:01:59.090> you<00:01:59.270> do<00:02:00.280> that<00:02:01.280> that's<00:02:01.520> easy

00:02:01.870 --> 00:02:01.880 
something that you do that that's easy

00:02:01.880 --> 00:02:04.270 
something that you do that that's easy
it<00:02:02.600> is<00:02:02.810> it's<00:02:03.020> a<00:02:03.080> process<00:02:03.320> and<00:02:03.560> our<00:02:03.799> guys<00:02:04.010> are

00:02:04.270 --> 00:02:04.280 
it is it's a process and our guys are

00:02:04.280 --> 00:02:07.090 
it is it's a process and our guys are
are<00:02:04.960> taking<00:02:05.960> two<00:02:06.080> steps<00:02:06.140> forward<00:02:06.590> and<00:02:06.799> I<00:02:06.920> think

00:02:07.090 --> 00:02:07.100 
are taking two steps forward and I think

00:02:07.100 --> 00:02:08.109 
are taking two steps forward and I think
we<00:02:07.159> took<00:02:07.280> a<00:02:07.340> little<00:02:07.490> bit<00:02:07.610> of<00:02:07.670> a<00:02:07.760> step<00:02:07.940> back

00:02:08.109 --> 00:02:08.119 
we took a little bit of a step back

00:02:08.119 --> 00:02:09.490 
we took a little bit of a step back
today<00:02:08.390> but<00:02:08.539> hopefully<00:02:08.629> we'll<00:02:08.929> learn<00:02:08.959> from<00:02:09.229> it

00:02:09.490 --> 00:02:09.500 
today but hopefully we'll learn from it

00:02:09.500 --> 00:02:11.470 
today but hopefully we'll learn from it
the<00:02:09.950> order<00:02:10.250> seeing<00:02:10.490> pretty<00:02:10.729> definitive<00:02:11.270> today

00:02:11.470 --> 00:02:11.480 
the order seeing pretty definitive today

00:02:11.480 --> 00:02:13.270 
the order seeing pretty definitive today
looked<00:02:11.750> like<00:02:11.900> goth<00:02:12.140> got<00:02:12.410> a<00:02:12.440> lot<00:02:12.710> more<00:02:12.740> reps<00:02:13.160> for

00:02:13.270 --> 00:02:13.280 
looked like goth got a lot more reps for

00:02:13.280 --> 00:02:14.800 
looked like goth got a lot more reps for
the<00:02:13.370> first<00:02:13.580> team<00:02:13.790> and<00:02:14.000> client<00:02:14.330> got<00:02:14.390> the<00:02:14.540> next

00:02:14.800 --> 00:02:14.810 
the first team and client got the next

00:02:14.810 --> 00:02:16.270 
the first team and client got the next
most<00:02:14.990> of<00:02:15.260> that<00:02:15.410> was<00:02:15.620> that<00:02:15.800> something<00:02:16.010> you<00:02:16.160> guys

00:02:16.270 --> 00:02:16.280 
most of that was that something you guys

00:02:16.280 --> 00:02:17.620 
most of that was that something you guys
designed<00:02:16.790> yeah<00:02:17.000> I<00:02:17.030> think<00:02:17.300> what<00:02:17.450> we're<00:02:17.600> doing

00:02:17.620 --> 00:02:17.630 
designed yeah I think what we're doing

00:02:17.630 --> 00:02:20.910 
designed yeah I think what we're doing
you<00:02:18.380> know<00:02:18.500> we're<00:02:19.130> going<00:02:19.220> to<00:02:19.280> give<00:02:19.460> Jared<00:02:19.910> and

00:02:20.910 --> 00:02:20.920 
you know we're going to give Jared and

00:02:20.920 --> 00:02:23.590 
you know we're going to give Jared and
you<00:02:21.920> know<00:02:22.040> Zack<00:02:22.760> and<00:02:23.000> Jared<00:02:23.240> right<00:02:23.390> now<00:02:23.510> i'll

00:02:23.590 --> 00:02:23.600 
you know Zack and Jared right now i'll

00:02:23.600 --> 00:02:25.510 
you know Zack and Jared right now i'll
get<00:02:23.690> the<00:02:23.800> majority<00:02:24.800> of<00:02:24.830> the<00:02:24.920> first-team<00:02:25.310> reps

00:02:25.510 --> 00:02:25.520 
get the majority of the first-team reps

00:02:25.520 --> 00:02:27.760 
get the majority of the first-team reps
and<00:02:25.820> we'll<00:02:26.450> split<00:02:26.630> it<00:02:26.720> up<00:02:26.900> you<00:02:27.290> know<00:02:27.410> from

00:02:27.760 --> 00:02:27.770 
and we'll split it up you know from

00:02:27.770 --> 00:02:29.380 
and we'll split it up you know from
there<00:02:27.950> and<00:02:28.160> then<00:02:28.280> Austin<00:02:28.790> won't<00:02:28.970> get<00:02:29.120> as<00:02:29.240> many

00:02:29.380 --> 00:02:29.390 
there and then Austin won't get as many

00:02:29.390 --> 00:02:32.140 
there and then Austin won't get as many
and<00:02:30.130> you<00:02:31.130> know<00:02:31.220> we'll<00:02:31.430> let<00:02:31.550> will<00:02:31.910> let<00:02:32.030> those

00:02:32.140 --> 00:02:32.150 
and you know we'll let will let those

00:02:32.150 --> 00:02:34.890 
and you know we'll let will let those
two<00:02:32.209> guys<00:02:32.510> kind<00:02:32.840> of<00:02:32.930> compete<00:02:33.200> and<00:02:33.410> yeah<00:02:33.650> and

00:02:34.890 --> 00:02:34.900 
two guys kind of compete and yeah and

00:02:34.900 --> 00:02:37.120 
two guys kind of compete and yeah and
and<00:02:35.900> so<00:02:36.050> you<00:02:36.140> see<00:02:36.260> what<00:02:36.470> happens<00:02:36.800> between<00:02:36.950> the

00:02:37.120 --> 00:02:37.130 
and so you see what happens between the

00:02:37.130 --> 00:02:38.590 
and so you see what happens between the
two<00:02:37.250> of<00:02:37.280> them<00:02:37.520> but<00:02:37.640> you<00:02:38.060> know<00:02:38.150> they<00:02:38.270> both<00:02:38.390> did

00:02:38.590 --> 00:02:38.600 
two of them but you know they both did

00:02:38.600 --> 00:02:39.940 
two of them but you know they both did
good<00:02:38.750> things<00:02:38.959> today<00:02:39.170> I<00:02:39.290> mean<00:02:39.470> I<00:02:39.500> think<00:02:39.530> that

00:02:39.940 --> 00:02:39.950 
good things today I mean I think that

00:02:39.950 --> 00:02:42.460 
good things today I mean I think that
again<00:02:40.790> you<00:02:41.600> know<00:02:41.690> all<00:02:41.840> three<00:02:42.200> of<00:02:42.290> the

00:02:42.460 --> 00:02:42.470 
again you know all three of the

00:02:42.470 --> 00:02:46.479 
again you know all three of the
quarterbacks<00:02:42.920> are<00:02:43.040> improved<00:02:43.430> I<00:02:43.730> think<00:02:45.489> you

00:02:46.479 --> 00:02:46.489 
quarterbacks are improved I think you

00:02:46.489 --> 00:02:48.520 
quarterbacks are improved I think you
know<00:02:46.580> I've<00:02:46.700> been<00:02:46.850> very<00:02:47.030> very<00:02:47.390> happy<00:02:47.660> with<00:02:48.320> what

00:02:48.520 --> 00:02:48.530 
know I've been very very happy with what

00:02:48.530 --> 00:02:50.530 
know I've been very very happy with what
I've<00:02:48.620> seen<00:02:48.830> out<00:02:49.040> of<00:02:49.130> that<00:02:49.250> group<00:02:49.459> Austin<00:02:50.390> was

00:02:50.530 --> 00:02:50.540 
I've seen out of that group Austin was

00:02:50.540 --> 00:02:52.570 
I've seen out of that group Austin was
probably<00:02:51.050> the<00:02:51.290> most<00:02:51.470> improved<00:02:51.950> what<00:02:52.310> he<00:02:52.400> did

00:02:52.570 --> 00:02:52.580 
probably the most improved what he did

00:02:52.580 --> 00:02:55.150 
probably the most improved what he did
this<00:02:52.700> summer<00:02:52.910> I<00:02:53.060> think<00:02:53.360> got<00:02:54.350> him<00:02:54.590> into<00:02:54.830> the<00:02:54.950> end

00:02:55.150 --> 00:02:55.160 
this summer I think got him into the end

00:02:55.160 --> 00:02:57.910 
this summer I think got him into the end
of<00:02:55.250> the<00:02:55.340> mix<00:02:55.550> probably<00:02:56.380> more<00:02:57.380> but<00:02:57.650> I<00:02:57.709> think

00:02:57.910 --> 00:02:57.920 
of the mix probably more but I think

00:02:57.920 --> 00:03:01.270 
of the mix probably more but I think

00:03:01.270 --> 00:03:01.280 
right now in sac and Jerry to kind of

00:03:01.280 --> 00:03:03.160 
right now in sac and Jerry to kind of
set<00:03:01.489> themselves<00:03:01.640> apart<00:03:01.910> are<00:03:02.750> there<00:03:02.900> any<00:03:02.959> guys

00:03:16.040 --> 00:03:17.949 
anticipate almost everybody I will play
some<00:03:16.400> I<00:03:16.430> think<00:03:16.730> will<00:03:16.850> limit<00:03:17.060> some<00:03:17.360> guys<00:03:17.540> but

00:03:17.949 --> 00:03:17.959 
some I think will limit some guys but

00:03:17.959 --> 00:03:19.509 
some I think will limit some guys but
I'd<00:03:18.080> like<00:03:18.230> to<00:03:18.290> I<00:03:18.709> think<00:03:19.160> it's<00:03:19.310> probably

00:03:19.509 --> 00:03:19.519 
I'd like to I think it's probably

00:03:19.519 --> 00:03:22.090 
I'd like to I think it's probably
important<00:03:20.260> to<00:03:21.260> get<00:03:21.410> Bigelow<00:03:21.709> out<00:03:21.830> there<00:03:22.010> and

00:03:22.090 --> 00:03:22.100 
important to get Bigelow out there and

00:03:22.100 --> 00:03:23.590 
important to get Bigelow out there and
let<00:03:22.190> him<00:03:22.250> let<00:03:22.549> him<00:03:22.610> get<00:03:22.790> hit<00:03:23.000> a<00:03:23.030> little<00:03:23.209> bit<00:03:23.360> let

00:03:23.590 --> 00:03:23.600 
let him let him get hit a little bit let

00:03:23.600 --> 00:03:25.509 
let him let him get hit a little bit let
them<00:03:23.720> you<00:03:24.380> know<00:03:24.500> finish<00:03:24.769> some<00:03:24.950> runs<00:03:25.160> get<00:03:25.400> his

00:03:25.509 --> 00:03:25.519 
them you know finish some runs get his

00:03:25.519 --> 00:03:30.220 
them you know finish some runs get his
pads<00:03:25.730> down<00:03:26.000> and<00:03:26.769> I<00:03:27.769> think<00:03:28.549> that's<00:03:28.700> always<00:03:29.230> the

00:03:30.220 --> 00:03:30.230 
pads down and I think that's always the

00:03:30.230 --> 00:03:31.990 
pads down and I think that's always the
next<00:03:30.380> step<00:03:30.739> getting<00:03:31.040> comfortable<00:03:31.459> after<00:03:31.880> an

00:03:31.990 --> 00:03:32.000 
next step getting comfortable after an

00:03:32.000 --> 00:03:34.449 
next step getting comfortable after an
injury<00:03:32.180> is<00:03:32.510> is<00:03:32.780> you<00:03:33.530> know<00:03:33.620> going<00:03:33.830> live<00:03:34.100> and

00:03:34.449 --> 00:03:34.459 
injury is is you know going live and

00:03:34.459 --> 00:03:36.580 
injury is is you know going live and
getting<00:03:35.239> a<00:03:35.330> tested<00:03:35.690> life<00:03:35.870> and<00:03:36.230> how<00:03:36.350> will<00:03:36.500> the

00:03:36.580 --> 00:03:36.590 
getting a tested life and how will the

00:03:36.590 --> 00:03:38.470 
getting a tested life and how will the
