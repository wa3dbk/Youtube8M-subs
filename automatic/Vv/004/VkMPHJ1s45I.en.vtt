00:00:04.860 --> 00:00:10.950
 Spanish the original book because we have 

00:00:07.380 --> 00:00:13.440

00:00:13.440 --> 00:00:17.300
 ldl mediacenter 

00:00:17.850 --> 00:00:22.520
 and we have my leaf that 

00:00:22.740 --> 00:00:30.270
 are our statistics I have a 

00:00:26.220 --> 00:00:33.000
 little bit playing and nothing is going there 

00:00:30.270 --> 00:00:36.020
 counting the number of times that 

00:00:33.000 --> 00:00:36.020
 we have sung the song 

00:00:36.600 --> 00:00:41.430
 and we have options because we can change 

00:00:39.300 --> 00:00:44.900
 the music of the menu 

00:00:41.430 --> 00:00:44.900
 it looks like electronics 

00:00:46.700 --> 00:00:52.670
 the law of the micro that if you want turn on 

00:00:49.670 --> 00:00:54.230
 the light effects the percussion that 

00:00:52.670 --> 00:00:56.130
 we can move the knob and it sounds like a 

00:00:54.230 --> 00:00:58.200
 tambourine 

00:00:56.130 --> 00:01:02.300
 we can calibrate the micro just in case 

00:00:58.200 --> 00:01:02.300
 with our voice the blind 

00:01:02.780 --> 00:01:09.900

 where to choose are a few hundred and 

00:01:14.420 --> 00:01:19.369
 it depends on the song there is also 

00:01:16.430 --> 00:01:20.870
 theme packets and these are the themes 

00:01:19.369 --> 00:01:23.720

00:01:20.870 --> 00:01:26.300
 in the original book and in the list in 

00:01:23.720 --> 00:01:28.230

00:02:04.800 --> 00:02:10.880
 a little dot is passing you over 

00:02:07.590 --> 00:02:15.670
 the letter so I can say it 

00:02:10.880 --> 00:02:15.670

00:02:16.470 --> 00:02:19.700

00:02:33.660 --> 00:02:40.250
