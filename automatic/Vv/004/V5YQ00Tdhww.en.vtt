extremely varied affair this is

00:05:08.310 --> 00:05:10.070 
extremely varied affair this is
definitely<00:05:08.699> no<00:05:08.969> Iron<00:05:09.210> Maiden's<00:05:09.569> worse<00:05:09.780> this

00:05:14.570 --> 00:05:14.580 
extremely close it just seems a little

00:05:21.870 --> 00:05:24.080 
main discs that I would actually put the
tag<00:05:22.080> on<00:05:22.319> that<00:05:22.380> it<00:05:22.770> just<00:05:22.800> seems<00:05:23.610> a<00:05:23.789> little<00:05:23.940> too

00:05:24.080 --> 00:05:24.090 
tag on that it just seems a little too

00:05:24.090 --> 00:05:26.390 
tag on that it just seems a little too
long<00:05:24.479> like<00:05:24.810> they<00:05:24.990> threw<00:05:25.680> a<00:05:25.800> little<00:05:25.979> too<00:05:26.219> much

00:05:26.390 --> 00:05:26.400 
long like they threw a little too much

00:05:26.400 --> 00:05:28.820 
long like they threw a little too much
on<00:05:26.639> there<00:05:26.909> like<00:05:27.150> too<00:05:27.509> many<00:05:27.780> items<00:05:28.110> too<00:05:28.680> many

00:05:28.820 --> 00:05:28.830 
on there like too many items too many

00:05:28.830 --> 00:05:31.580 
on there like too many items too many
songs<00:05:29.219> too<00:05:29.580> many<00:05:29.729> ideas<00:05:29.909> you<00:05:30.479> know<00:05:31.139> made<00:05:31.409> the

00:05:31.580 --> 00:05:31.590 
songs too many ideas you know made the

00:05:31.590 --> 00:05:33.680 
songs too many ideas you know made the
cut<00:05:31.830> when<00:05:32.159> in<00:05:32.310> reality<00:05:32.789> maybe<00:05:32.969> a<00:05:33.150> couple<00:05:33.419> of

00:05:33.680 --> 00:05:33.690 
cut when in reality maybe a couple of

00:05:33.690 --> 00:05:34.999 
cut when in reality maybe a couple of
them<00:05:33.810> should<00:05:34.050> have<00:05:34.080> been<00:05:34.259> honed<00:05:34.469> a<00:05:34.680> little<00:05:34.889> bit

00:05:34.999 --> 00:05:35.009 
them should have been honed a little bit

00:05:35.009 --> 00:05:37.670 
them should have been honed a little bit
more<00:05:35.250> either<00:05:35.909> that<00:05:36.270> or<00:05:36.330> perhaps<00:05:36.779> left<00:05:37.469> as

00:05:37.670 --> 00:05:37.680 
more either that or perhaps left as

00:05:37.680 --> 00:05:40.040 
more either that or perhaps left as
b-sides<00:05:37.889> for<00:05:38.520> a<00:05:38.599> single<00:05:39.599> release<00:05:39.810> or

00:05:40.040 --> 00:05:40.050 
b-sides for a single release or

00:05:40.050 --> 00:05:42.559 
b-sides for a single release or
something<00:05:40.349> of<00:05:40.529> that<00:05:40.560> magnitude<00:05:41.240> now<00:05:42.240> be<00:05:42.419> that

00:05:42.559 --> 00:05:42.569 
something of that magnitude now be that

00:05:42.569 --> 00:05:44.209 
something of that magnitude now be that
as<00:05:42.719> it<00:05:42.750> may<00:05:42.960> how<00:05:43.199> over<00:05:43.469> fear<00:05:43.650> the<00:05:43.800> dark<00:05:44.069> was

00:05:44.209 --> 00:05:44.219 
as it may how over fear the dark was

00:05:44.219 --> 00:05:46.760 
as it may how over fear the dark was
released<00:05:44.580> as<00:05:44.789> is<00:05:45.120> so<00:05:45.630> I<00:05:45.960> would<00:05:46.020> say<00:05:46.380> about<00:05:46.409> a

00:05:46.760 --> 00:05:46.770 
released as is so I would say about a

00:05:46.770 --> 00:05:48.860 
released as is so I would say about a
seven<00:05:47.250> out<00:05:47.340> of<00:05:47.460> ten<00:05:47.520> maybe<00:05:48.000> six<00:05:48.419> point<00:05:48.659> seven

00:05:48.860 --> 00:05:48.870 
seven out of ten maybe six point seven

00:05:48.870 --> 00:05:51.769 
seven out of ten maybe six point seven
five<00:05:49.229> as<00:05:49.500> being<00:05:49.710> a<00:05:49.800> little<00:05:50.039> too<00:05:50.190> cruel<00:05:50.779> however

00:05:51.769 --> 00:05:51.779 
five as being a little too cruel however

00:05:51.779 --> 00:05:54.529 
five as being a little too cruel however
this<00:05:51.990> is<00:05:52.169> a<00:05:52.199> disc<00:05:52.500> that's<00:05:52.830> kind<00:05:53.219> of<00:05:53.340> it's<00:05:54.270> one

00:06:03.379 --> 00:06:03.389 
certain songs over and over again but

00:06:03.389 --> 00:06:04.939 
certain songs over and over again but
the<00:06:03.509> whole<00:06:03.659> entire<00:06:03.930> experience<00:06:03.990> as<00:06:04.650> a<00:06:04.680> whole

00:06:04.939 --> 00:06:04.949 
the whole entire experience as a whole

00:06:04.949 --> 00:06:07.969 
the whole entire experience as a whole
is<00:06:05.069> somewhat<00:06:05.430> tainted<00:06:05.909> it<00:06:06.029> seems<00:06:06.300> so<00:06:07.080> as<00:06:07.949> a

00:06:07.969 --> 00:06:07.979 
is somewhat tainted it seems so as a

00:06:07.979 --> 00:06:12.080 
is somewhat tainted it seems so as a
whole<00:06:08.400> we're<00:06:09.210> now<00:06:09.360> two<00:06:09.960> out<00:06:10.380> of<00:06:10.620> two<00:06:11.000> for<00:06:12.000> the

00:06:12.080 --> 00:06:12.090 
whole we're now two out of two for the

00:06:12.090 --> 00:06:13.879 
whole we're now two out of two for the
past<00:06:12.270> two<00:06:12.509> albums<00:06:12.930> that<00:06:13.199> have<00:06:13.349> really<00:06:13.590> kind<00:06:13.740> of

00:06:13.879 --> 00:06:13.889 
past two albums that have really kind of

00:06:13.889 --> 00:06:16.249 
past two albums that have really kind of
fit<00:06:14.460> this<00:06:14.580> particular<00:06:14.880> bill<00:06:15.360> and<00:06:15.630> it<00:06:16.020> seems

00:06:16.249 --> 00:06:16.259 
fit this particular bill and it seems

00:06:16.259 --> 00:06:18.350 
fit this particular bill and it seems
that<00:06:16.380> they<00:06:16.590> as<00:06:16.800> the<00:06:17.250> band<00:06:17.580> was<00:06:17.729> kind<00:06:17.909> of<00:06:18.060> going

00:06:18.350 --> 00:06:18.360 
that they as the band was kind of going

00:06:18.360 --> 00:06:19.550 
that they as the band was kind of going
on<00:06:18.449> a<00:06:18.509> little<00:06:18.750> bit<00:06:18.840> of<00:06:18.930> a<00:06:19.020> downhill<00:06:19.229> eye

00:06:19.550 --> 00:06:19.560 
on a little bit of a downhill eye

00:06:19.560 --> 00:06:22.399 
on a little bit of a downhill eye
downward<00:06:20.069> spiral<00:06:20.580> so<00:06:20.789> to<00:06:20.849> speak<00:06:21.180> so<00:06:22.020> for<00:06:22.259> the

00:06:22.399 --> 00:06:22.409 
downward spiral so to speak so for the

00:06:22.409 --> 00:06:25.129 
downward spiral so to speak so for the
