00:00:49.280 --> 00:00:49.290 
bishop and then with the idea of getting

00:00:49.290 --> 00:00:53.450 
bishop and then with the idea of getting
into<00:00:49.970> d6<00:00:50.970> after<00:00:51.660> the<00:00:51.750> typical<00:00:52.230> c5<00:00:52.740> striking<00:00:53.340> at

00:00:53.450 --> 00:00:53.460 
into d6 after the typical c5 striking at

00:00:53.460 --> 00:00:57.320 
into d6 after the typical c5 striking at
the<00:00:53.580> base<00:00:53.790> point<00:00:54.150> we<00:00:55.050> are<00:00:55.080> having<00:00:55.590> that<00:00:56.330> so

00:00:57.320 --> 00:00:57.330 
the base point we are having that so

00:00:57.330 --> 00:01:01.130 
the base point we are having that so
click<00:00:58.260> there<00:00:58.560> so<00:00:58.800> 97<00:00:59.760> White<00:01:00.570> has<00:01:00.750> a<00:01:00.780> space

00:01:01.130 --> 00:01:01.140 
click there so 97 White has a space

00:01:01.140 --> 00:01:05.119 
click there so 97 White has a space
advantage<00:01:01.710> and<00:01:03.320> could<00:01:04.320> look<00:01:04.530> to<00:01:04.559> maybe<00:01:04.890> put

00:01:05.119 --> 00:01:05.129 
advantage and could look to maybe put

00:01:05.129 --> 00:01:08.179 
advantage and could look to maybe put
pressure<00:01:05.400> on<00:01:05.610> g7<00:01:06.090> one<00:01:06.420> day<00:01:06.600> Queen<00:01:06.990> g4<00:01:07.500> comes<00:01:08.070> a

00:01:08.179 --> 00:01:08.189 
pressure on g7 one day Queen g4 comes a

00:01:08.189 --> 00:01:12.039 
pressure on g7 one day Queen g4 comes a
little<00:01:08.429> bit<00:01:08.520> awkward<00:01:08.670> to<00:01:09.500> defend<00:01:10.500> against<00:01:10.829> g7

00:01:12.039 --> 00:01:12.049 
little bit awkward to defend against g7

00:01:12.049 --> 00:01:15.080 
little bit awkward to defend against g7
it's<00:01:13.049> kind<00:01:13.229> of<00:01:13.289> like<00:01:13.439> when<00:01:14.039> we<00:01:14.670> are<00:01:14.789> having

00:01:15.080 --> 00:01:15.090 
it's kind of like when we are having

00:01:15.090 --> 00:01:17.510 
it's kind of like when we are having
that<00:01:15.240> you<00:01:16.200> see<00:01:16.409> this<00:01:16.560> from<00:01:16.740> time<00:01:16.920> to<00:01:17.100> time<00:01:17.130> when

00:01:17.510 --> 00:01:17.520 
that you see this from time to time when

00:01:17.520 --> 00:01:20.539 
that you see this from time to time when
the<00:01:17.640> Queen<00:01:17.850> Bishop<00:01:18.030> comes<00:01:18.390> out<00:01:19.310> weakens<00:01:20.310> be

00:01:20.539 --> 00:01:20.549 
the Queen Bishop comes out weakens be

00:01:20.549 --> 00:01:22.849 
the Queen Bishop comes out weakens be
two<00:01:20.789> in<00:01:21.119> the<00:01:21.899> black<00:01:22.109> queen<00:01:22.259> could<00:01:22.499> come<00:01:22.649> out<00:01:22.740> in

00:01:22.849 --> 00:01:22.859 
two in the black queen could come out in

00:01:22.859 --> 00:01:25.399 
two in the black queen could come out in
this<00:01:22.950> direction<00:01:23.100> to<00:01:23.549> attack<00:01:23.820> it<00:01:24.109> but<00:01:25.109> we<00:01:25.229> could

00:01:25.399 --> 00:01:25.409 
this direction to attack it but we could

00:01:25.409 --> 00:01:27.560 
this direction to attack it but we could
have<00:01:25.439> that<00:01:25.799> with<00:01:26.340> also<00:01:26.670> the<00:01:26.789> King<00:01:26.999> bishops<00:01:27.390> in

00:01:27.560 --> 00:01:27.570 
have that with also the King bishops in

00:01:27.570 --> 00:01:30.050 
have that with also the King bishops in
this<00:01:27.689> particular<00:01:27.899> line<00:01:28.609> so<00:01:29.609> the<00:01:29.729> king<00:01:29.909> bishop

00:01:30.050 --> 00:01:30.060 
this particular line so the king bishop

00:01:30.060 --> 00:01:34.279 
this particular line so the king bishop
comes<00:01:30.390> out<00:01:31.280> bg7<00:01:32.280> is<00:01:32.549> hit<00:01:32.759> and<00:01:32.990> this<00:01:33.990> is<00:01:34.140> an

00:01:34.279 --> 00:01:34.289 
comes out bg7 is hit and this is an

00:01:34.289 --> 00:01:37.039 
comes out bg7 is hit and this is an
interesting<00:01:34.530> a<00:01:35.929> reorganization<00:01:36.929> of<00:01:37.020> the

00:01:37.039 --> 00:01:37.049 
interesting a reorganization of the

00:01:37.049 --> 00:01:39.679 
interesting a reorganization of the
pieces<00:01:37.289> or<00:01:37.560> i<00:01:37.590> should<00:01:37.799> say<00:01:38.210> getting<00:01:39.210> the<00:01:39.390> Queen

00:01:39.679 --> 00:01:39.689 
pieces or i should say getting the Queen

00:01:39.689 --> 00:01:41.539 
pieces or i should say getting the Queen
out<00:01:39.869> prior<00:01:40.259> to<00:01:40.289> developing<00:01:40.710> the<00:01:41.100> knight<00:01:41.249> to<00:01:41.399> f3

00:01:41.539 --> 00:01:41.549 
out prior to developing the knight to f3

00:01:41.549 --> 00:01:43.340 
out prior to developing the knight to f3
so<00:01:42.119> she's<00:01:42.390> certainly<00:01:42.689> more<00:01:42.899> aggressively

00:01:43.340 --> 00:01:43.350 
so she's certainly more aggressively

00:01:43.350 --> 00:01:44.779 
so she's certainly more aggressively
placed<00:01:43.710> and<00:01:43.979> not<00:01:44.069> question<00:01:44.520> is<00:01:44.609> being

00:01:44.779 --> 00:01:44.789 
placed and not question is being

00:01:44.789 --> 00:01:47.450 
placed and not question is being
threatened<00:01:45.149> her<00:01:46.139> place<00:01:46.439> to<00:01:46.679> the<00:01:46.799> Queen<00:01:47.069> where

00:01:47.450 --> 00:01:47.460 
threatened her place to the Queen where

00:01:47.460 --> 00:01:53.620 
threatened her place to the Queen where
to<00:01:47.609> go<00:01:49.189> hmm<00:01:50.189> Lena<00:01:50.579> 5<00:01:50.969> is<00:01:51.179> a<00:01:51.210> strong<00:01:51.600> piece

00:01:53.620 --> 00:01:53.630 
to go hmm Lena 5 is a strong piece

00:01:53.630 --> 00:01:56.029 
to go hmm Lena 5 is a strong piece
probably<00:01:54.630> in<00:01:54.719> order<00:01:54.990> in<00:01:55.200> order<00:01:55.319> to<00:01:55.590> make<00:01:55.829> any

00:01:56.029 --> 00:01:56.039 
probably in order in order to make any

00:01:56.039 --> 00:01:57.649 
probably in order in order to make any
progress<00:01:56.340> you<00:01:56.700> have<00:01:56.729> to<00:01:56.969> get<00:01:57.149> rid<00:01:57.389> of<00:01:57.450> this

00:01:57.649 --> 00:01:57.659 
progress you have to get rid of this

00:01:57.659 --> 00:02:00.230 
progress you have to get rid of this
night<00:01:57.960> but<00:01:58.200> that's<00:01:58.350> not<00:01:58.649> so<00:01:58.950> easy<00:01:59.240> I'm

00:02:00.230 --> 00:02:00.240 
night but that's not so easy I'm

00:02:00.240 --> 00:02:02.870 
night but that's not so easy I'm
assuming<00:02:00.780> b6<00:02:01.469> his<00:02:01.649> idea<00:02:02.009> was<00:02:02.280> to<00:02:02.429> play<00:02:02.609> Bishop

00:02:02.870 --> 00:02:02.880 
assuming b6 his idea was to play Bishop

00:02:02.880 --> 00:02:07.279 
assuming b6 his idea was to play Bishop
a6<00:02:04.399> getting<00:02:05.399> rid<00:02:05.520> of<00:02:05.609> the<00:02:05.670> bad<00:02:05.939> Bishop<00:02:06.420> for<00:02:07.170> why

00:02:07.279 --> 00:02:07.289 
a6 getting rid of the bad Bishop for why

00:02:07.289 --> 00:02:10.480 
a6 getting rid of the bad Bishop for why
it's<00:02:07.469> good<00:02:07.740> Bishop<00:02:08.240> not<00:02:09.240> having<00:02:09.600> that<00:02:09.630> though

00:02:10.480 --> 00:02:10.490 
it's good Bishop not having that though

00:02:10.490 --> 00:02:13.850 
it's good Bishop not having that though

hmm<00:04:27.490> because<00:04:28.490> still<00:04:28.790> with<00:04:29.980> her<00:04:30.980> that

00:04:31.120 --> 00:04:31.130 
hmm because still with her that

00:04:31.130 --> 00:04:32.890 
hmm because still with her that
expression<00:04:31.490> what<00:04:31.790> is<00:04:31.910> it<00:04:32.030> like<00:04:32.120> a<00:04:32.180> queen<00:04:32.630> lyst

00:04:32.890 --> 00:04:32.900 
expression what is it like a queen lyst

00:04:32.900 --> 00:04:34.780 
expression what is it like a queen lyst
this<00:04:33.500> is<00:04:33.680> still<00:04:33.950> I<00:04:34.190> wouldn't<00:04:34.430> you<00:04:34.640> wouldn't

00:04:34.780 --> 00:04:34.790 
this is still I wouldn't you wouldn't

00:04:34.790 --> 00:04:37.540 
this is still I wouldn't you wouldn't
consider<00:04:35.090> this<00:04:35.330> an<00:04:35.480> end<00:04:35.660> game<00:04:35.920> but<00:04:36.920> rather<00:04:37.400> a

00:04:37.540 --> 00:04:37.550 
consider this an end game but rather a

00:04:37.550 --> 00:04:39.400 
consider this an end game but rather a
queenless<00:04:38.210> middle<00:04:38.630> game<00:04:38.810> still<00:04:39.140> a<00:04:39.200> lot<00:04:39.380> of

00:04:39.400 --> 00:04:39.410 
queenless middle game still a lot of

00:04:39.410 --> 00:04:41.530 
queenless middle game still a lot of
firepower<00:04:39.920> loll<00:04:40.580> minor<00:04:40.880> pieces<00:04:41.180> on<00:04:41.420> the<00:04:41.510> board

00:04:41.530 --> 00:04:41.540 
firepower loll minor pieces on the board

00:04:41.540 --> 00:04:45.570 
firepower loll minor pieces on the board
and<00:04:41.930> this<00:04:42.110> move<00:04:42.410> is<00:04:42.680> there<00:04:43.930> in<00:04:44.930> order<00:04:45.140> to

00:04:45.570 --> 00:04:45.580 
and this move is there in order to

00:04:45.580 --> 00:04:49.450 
and this move is there in order to
shatter<00:04:46.580> this<00:04:46.820> structure<00:04:47.300> isolate<00:04:48.290> the<00:04:48.440> a<00:04:48.470> the

00:04:49.450 --> 00:04:49.460 
shatter this structure isolate the a the

00:04:49.460 --> 00:04:52.000 
shatter this structure isolate the a the
queenside<00:04:49.940> pawns<00:04:50.270> now<00:04:50.540> it's<00:04:50.720> an<00:04:50.810> AC<00:04:51.110> structure

00:04:52.000 --> 00:04:52.010 
queenside pawns now it's an AC structure

00:04:52.010 --> 00:04:55.230 
queenside pawns now it's an AC structure
and<00:04:52.910> it<00:04:53.330> is<00:04:53.450> being<00:04:53.660> pinpointed<00:04:54.440> right<00:04:54.620> now

00:04:55.230 --> 00:04:55.240 
and it is being pinpointed right now

00:04:55.240 --> 00:04:58.210 
and it is being pinpointed right now
with<00:04:56.240> the<00:04:56.390> Bishop<00:04:56.720> g2<00:04:57.050> to<00:04:57.410> follow<00:04:57.650> this<00:04:58.010> is

00:04:58.210 --> 00:04:58.220 
with the Bishop g2 to follow this is

00:04:58.220 --> 00:04:59.910 
with the Bishop g2 to follow this is
going<00:04:58.520> to<00:04:58.640> be<00:04:58.760> a<00:04:58.790> little<00:04:59.000> bit<00:04:59.120> uncomfortable

00:04:59.910 --> 00:04:59.920 
going to be a little bit uncomfortable

00:04:59.920 --> 00:05:02.230 
going to be a little bit uncomfortable
so<00:05:00.920> the<00:05:01.040> king<00:05:01.280> is<00:05:01.520> in<00:05:01.730> the<00:05:01.820> middle<00:05:02.120> of<00:05:02.150> the

00:05:02.230 --> 00:05:02.240 
so the king is in the middle of the

00:05:02.240 --> 00:05:05.950 
so the king is in the middle of the
board<00:05:02.450> and<00:05:02.690> now<00:05:02.840> f2<00:05:03.410> is<00:05:03.650> hit<00:05:04.330> ouch<00:05:05.330> this<00:05:05.780> could

00:05:05.950 --> 00:05:05.960 
board and now f2 is hit ouch this could

00:05:05.960 --> 00:05:09.070 
board and now f2 is hit ouch this could
be<00:05:06.080> very<00:05:06.110> painful<00:05:06.620> King<00:05:07.220> I<00:05:07.900> totally<00:05:08.900> missed

that<00:05:09.190> and<00:05:10.190> I<00:05:10.310> could<00:05:10.550> take<00:05:10.760> care<00:05:11.060> so<00:05:11.570> he<00:05:11.660> was

00:05:11.800 --> 00:05:11.810 
that and I could take care so he was

00:05:11.810 --> 00:05:13.450 
that and I could take care so he was
hitting<00:05:12.080> up<00:05:12.200> the<00:05:12.320> night<00:05:12.800> in<00:05:12.950> the<00:05:13.040> pond<00:05:13.220> I<00:05:13.250> was

00:05:17.500 --> 00:05:17.510 
threatening a fork on the queenside as

00:05:17.510 --> 00:05:19.750 
threatening a fork on the queenside as
well<00:05:17.720> it's<00:05:18.650> okay<00:05:18.920> we<00:05:19.100> do<00:05:19.220> have<00:05:19.250> those<00:05:19.520> nights

00:05:22.050 --> 00:05:22.060 
being exchanged this problem is hit and

00:05:22.060 --> 00:05:24.790 
being exchanged this problem is hit and
ok<00:05:23.060> now<00:05:23.330> we're<00:05:23.570> probably<00:05:23.960> going<00:05:24.260> to<00:05:24.440> have<00:05:24.560> this

00:05:24.790 --> 00:05:24.800 
ok now we're probably going to have this

00:05:24.800 --> 00:05:27.010 
ok now we're probably going to have this
night<00:05:25.250> be<00:05:25.520> four<00:05:25.820> I'm<00:05:26.120> pretty<00:05:26.360> sure<00:05:26.600> tonight<00:05:26.870> a

00:05:27.010 --> 00:05:27.020 
night be four I'm pretty sure tonight a

00:05:27.020 --> 00:05:29.530 
night be four I'm pretty sure tonight a
three<00:05:27.650> would<00:05:28.490> be<00:05:28.520> needed<00:05:28.970> you<00:05:29.120> don't<00:05:29.300> want<00:05:29.450> to

00:05:29.530 --> 00:05:29.540 
three would be needed you don't want to

00:05:29.540 --> 00:05:32.440 
three would be needed you don't want to
move<00:05:29.810> this<00:05:30.020> pawn<00:05:30.320> because<00:05:30.530> that<00:05:30.860> will<00:05:31.090> be<00:05:32.090> game

00:05:32.440 --> 00:05:32.450 
move this pawn because that will be game

00:05:32.450 --> 00:05:35.770 
move this pawn because that will be game
over<00:05:33.010> so<00:05:34.010> just<00:05:34.400> simply<00:05:34.940> giving<00:05:35.270> up<00:05:35.360> this<00:05:35.510> pond

00:05:35.770 --> 00:05:35.780 
over so just simply giving up this pond

00:05:35.780 --> 00:05:38.050 
over so just simply giving up this pond
ok<00:05:36.410> i<00:05:36.440> guess<00:05:36.860> the<00:05:37.010> trick<00:05:37.250> was<00:05:37.400> if<00:05:37.580> Bishop<00:05:37.730> takes

00:05:38.050 --> 00:05:38.060 
ok i guess the trick was if Bishop takes

00:05:38.060 --> 00:05:40.450 
ok i guess the trick was if Bishop takes
Knight<00:05:38.210> here<00:05:38.930> hitting<00:05:39.680> the<00:05:39.800> bishop<00:05:40.130> and<00:05:40.280> then

00:05:40.450 --> 00:05:40.460 
Knight here hitting the bishop and then

00:05:40.460 --> 00:05:43.480 
Knight here hitting the bishop and then
hitting<00:05:40.700> c2<00:05:41.300> but<00:05:41.600> maybe<00:05:42.320> a<00:05:42.440> bishop<00:05:42.740> a4<00:05:43.280> would

00:05:43.480 --> 00:05:43.490 
hitting c2 but maybe a bishop a4 would

00:05:43.490 --> 00:05:46.540 
hitting c2 but maybe a bishop a4 would
have<00:05:43.580> been<00:05:43.790> available<00:05:45.160> saving<00:05:46.160> the<00:05:46.190> bishop

00:05:46.540 --> 00:05:46.550 
have been available saving the bishop

00:05:46.550 --> 00:05:48.310 
have been available saving the bishop
and<00:05:46.670> defending<00:05:47.180> c2<00:05:47.600> but<00:05:47.870> we're<00:05:47.990> beyond<00:05:48.290> that

00:05:48.310 --> 00:05:48.320 
and defending c2 but we're beyond that

00:05:48.320 --> 00:05:51.700 
and defending c2 but we're beyond that
point<00:05:49.540> if<00:05:50.540> there's<00:05:50.750> a<00:05:50.810> way<00:05:50.960> to<00:05:50.990> really<00:05:51.290> exploit

00:05:51.700 --> 00:05:51.710 
point if there's a way to really exploit

00:05:51.710 --> 00:05:53.110 
point if there's a way to really exploit
the<00:05:51.860> King<00:05:52.040> position<00:05:52.460> we<00:05:52.550> could<00:05:52.730> maybe<00:05:52.880> have

00:05:53.110 --> 00:05:53.120 
the King position we could maybe have

00:05:53.120 --> 00:05:56.880 
the King position we could maybe have
black<00:05:53.450> returning<00:05:53.960> the<00:05:54.050> favor<00:05:54.370> with<00:05:55.370> c3

00:05:56.880 --> 00:05:56.890 
black returning the favor with c3

00:05:56.890 --> 00:06:00.490 
black returning the favor with c3
disrupting<00:05:58.360> the<00:05:59.360> white<00:05:59.540> structure<00:06:00.020> but<00:06:00.230> black

00:06:00.490 --> 00:06:00.500 
disrupting the white structure but black

00:06:00.500 --> 00:06:02.950 
disrupting the white structure but black
instead<00:06:01.100> simply<00:06:01.790> defends<00:06:02.420> not<00:06:02.600> wanting<00:06:02.930> to

00:06:02.950 --> 00:06:02.960 
instead simply defends not wanting to

00:06:02.960 --> 00:06:04.720 
instead simply defends not wanting to
give<00:06:03.170> the<00:06:03.260> material<00:06:03.710> back<00:06:03.890> how<00:06:04.280> do<00:06:04.340> we<00:06:04.490> stand

give the material back how do we stand

00:06:04.730 --> 00:06:08.290 
give the material back how do we stand

00:06:27.890 --> 00:06:31.630 
and d3 and there's already support for
for<00:06:28.340> this<00:06:28.460> extra<00:06:29.180> pun<00:06:30.110> that<00:06:30.140> black<00:06:30.560> has<00:06:30.830> on<00:06:31.040> c4

00:06:34.240 --> 00:06:34.250 
so jumping right in this is very

00:06:34.250 --> 00:06:35.920 
so jumping right in this is very
uncomfortable<00:06:34.430> could<00:06:35.210> always<00:06:35.450> pick<00:06:35.630> up<00:06:35.690> the

00:06:35.920 --> 00:06:35.930 
uncomfortable could always pick up the

00:06:35.930 --> 00:06:37.930 
uncomfortable could always pick up the
bishop<00:06:36.260> but<00:06:36.380> there's<00:06:36.590> simply<00:06:36.770> no<00:06:37.100> reason<00:06:37.370> to

00:06:37.930 --> 00:06:37.940 
bishop but there's simply no reason to

00:06:37.940 --> 00:06:38.800 
bishop but there's simply no reason to
do<00:06:38.090> that<00:06:38.120> you<00:06:38.390> should

00:06:38.800 --> 00:06:38.810 
do that you should

00:06:38.810 --> 00:06:41.620 
do that you should
this<00:06:38.930> sitting<00:06:39.910> instead<00:06:40.910> put<00:06:41.210> more<00:06:41.419> pressure

00:06:41.620 --> 00:06:41.630 
this sitting instead put more pressure

00:06:41.630 --> 00:06:46.030 
this sitting instead put more pressure
