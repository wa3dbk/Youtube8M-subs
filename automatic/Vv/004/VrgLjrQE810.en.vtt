the heart of the Christmas reality is a

00:00:21.539 --> 00:00:24.350 
the heart of the Christmas reality is a
subversive<00:00:22.170> story<00:00:22.830> the<00:00:23.580> way<00:00:23.700> Luke<00:00:23.910> sets<00:00:24.180> it<00:00:24.270> up

00:00:24.350 --> 00:00:24.360 
subversive story the way Luke sets it up

00:00:24.360 --> 00:00:26.840 
subversive story the way Luke sets it up
the<00:00:25.230> story<00:00:25.470> of<00:00:25.590> two<00:00:25.710> kings<00:00:26.010> he<00:00:26.400> tells<00:00:26.640> us<00:00:26.730> about

the story of two kings he tells us about
Caesar<00:00:27.210> Augustus<00:00:27.390> in<00:00:27.840> Rome<00:00:27.890> but<00:00:28.890> then

00:00:29.029 --> 00:00:29.039 
Caesar Augustus in Rome but then

00:00:29.039 --> 00:00:31.720 
Caesar Augustus in Rome but then
consistently<00:00:29.730> lays<00:00:30.150> out<00:00:30.360> the<00:00:30.930> New<00:00:31.080> King<00:00:31.350> Jesus

00:00:35.360 --> 00:00:35.370 
encounter distinction to Caesar and so

00:00:35.370 --> 00:00:36.740 
encounter distinction to Caesar and so
we<00:00:35.489> see<00:00:35.670> a<00:00:35.699> different<00:00:36.239> vision<00:00:36.480> of<00:00:36.539> life

00:00:36.740 --> 00:00:36.750 
we see a different vision of life

00:00:36.750 --> 00:00:39.229 
we see a different vision of life

00:00:39.239 --> 00:00:41.240 
opening up one of my favorite details is
the<00:00:40.200> appearance<00:00:40.470> of<00:00:40.620> the<00:00:40.680> angels

00:00:41.240 --> 00:00:41.250 
the appearance of the angels

00:00:50.060 --> 00:00:50.070 
of angels appears to the shepherds well

00:00:50.070 --> 00:00:51.709 
of angels appears to the shepherds well
it's<00:00:50.160> meant<00:00:50.370> to<00:00:50.489> contrast<00:00:51.030> with<00:00:51.390> the<00:00:51.540> great

00:00:51.709 --> 00:00:51.719 
it's meant to contrast with the great

00:00:51.719 --> 00:00:54.049 
it's meant to contrast with the great
army<00:00:52.140> of<00:00:52.260> Caesar<00:00:52.500> Augustus<00:00:52.680> the<00:00:53.640> army<00:00:53.940> of<00:00:54.030> the

army of Caesar Augustus the army of the

00:00:54.059 --> 00:00:56.360 
army of Caesar Augustus the army of the
baby<00:00:54.329> king<00:00:54.690> is<00:00:54.930> stronger<00:00:55.530> and<00:00:55.739> will<00:00:55.829> win<00:00:56.040> the

00:00:56.360 --> 00:00:56.370 
baby king is stronger and will win the

00:00:56.370 --> 00:00:58.670 
baby king is stronger and will win the
day<00:00:56.579> so<00:00:57.300> right<00:00:57.480> away<00:00:57.600> it's<00:00:57.899> not<00:00:57.989> a<00:00:58.050> sentimental

00:00:58.670 --> 00:00:58.680 
day so right away it's not a sentimental

00:00:58.680 --> 00:01:00.650 
day so right away it's not a sentimental
story<00:00:58.920> at<00:00:59.070> all<00:00:59.190> it's<00:00:59.550> a<00:00:59.760> story<00:01:00.600> of

00:01:00.650 --> 00:01:00.660 
story at all it's a story of

00:01:00.660 --> 00:01:03.410 
story at all it's a story of
confrontation<00:01:01.379> between<00:01:01.890> two<00:01:02.160> worldviews<00:01:03.120> two

00:01:03.410 --> 00:01:03.420 
confrontation between two worldviews two

00:01:03.420 --> 00:01:06.230 
confrontation between two worldviews two
sets<00:01:03.660> of<00:01:03.780> values<00:01:04.670> so<00:01:05.670> in<00:01:05.729> that<00:01:05.850> way<00:01:05.969> it<00:01:06.090> sets

00:01:06.230 --> 00:01:06.240 
sets of values so in that way it sets

00:01:06.240 --> 00:01:07.819 
sets of values so in that way it sets
the<00:01:06.390> tone<00:01:06.420> for<00:01:06.630> the<00:01:06.899> whole<00:01:07.079> gospel<00:01:07.259> that<00:01:07.619> leads

00:01:07.819 --> 00:01:07.829 
the tone for the whole gospel that leads

00:01:07.829 --> 00:01:10.310 
the tone for the whole gospel that leads
right<00:01:07.950> up<00:01:08.219> to<00:01:08.310> the<00:01:08.399> cross<00:01:08.610> when<00:01:09.329> Jesus<00:01:09.360> once

00:01:10.310 --> 00:01:10.320 
right up to the cross when Jesus once

00:01:10.320 --> 00:01:12.620 
right up to the cross when Jesus once
again<00:01:10.619> confronts<00:01:11.369> the<00:01:11.850> representative<00:01:12.540> of

00:01:12.620 --> 00:01:12.630 
again confronts the representative of

00:01:12.630 --> 00:01:15.920 
again confronts the representative of
Caesar<00:01:12.840> Augustus<00:01:12.930> and<00:01:14.030> does<00:01:15.030> battle<00:01:15.210> with<00:01:15.570> him

00:01:15.920 --> 00:01:15.930 
Caesar Augustus and does battle with him

00:01:15.930 --> 00:01:18.250 
Caesar Augustus and does battle with him
so<00:01:16.350> I<00:01:16.380> like<00:01:16.650> that<00:01:16.860> motif<00:01:17.190> a<00:01:17.340> lot<00:01:17.520> of<00:01:17.640> the

00:01:18.250 --> 00:01:18.260 
so I like that motif a lot of the

00:01:18.260 --> 00:01:21.679 
so I like that motif a lot of the
subversive<00:01:19.260> quality<00:01:19.680> of<00:01:19.799> Christmas<00:01:20.659> also<00:01:21.659> I

00:01:21.679 --> 00:01:21.689 
subversive quality of Christmas also I

00:01:21.689 --> 00:01:24.950 
subversive quality of Christmas also I
talk<00:01:21.930> about<00:01:22.080> the<00:01:22.549> journey<00:01:23.549> of<00:01:23.670> the<00:01:23.729> Magi<00:01:24.030> which

00:01:24.950 --> 00:01:24.960 
talk about the journey of the Magi which

00:01:24.960 --> 00:01:28.550 
talk about the journey of the Magi which
I<00:01:25.110> think<00:01:25.380> properly<00:01:26.570> deciphered<00:01:27.570> is<00:01:27.900> a

00:01:28.550 --> 00:01:28.560 
I think properly deciphered is a

00:01:28.560 --> 00:01:30.170 
I think properly deciphered is a
tremendous<00:01:29.340> metaphor<00:01:29.850> for<00:01:30.000> the<00:01:30.060> whole

00:01:30.170 --> 00:01:30.180 
tremendous metaphor for the whole

00:01:30.180 --> 00:01:32.539 
tremendous metaphor for the whole
spiritual<00:01:30.600> life<00:01:30.750> the<00:01:31.680> Magi<00:01:32.100> who<00:01:32.159> are

00:01:32.539 --> 00:01:32.549 
spiritual life the Magi who are

00:01:32.549 --> 00:01:35.240 
spiritual life the Magi who are
searchers<00:01:33.450> like<00:01:33.630> so<00:01:33.780> many<00:01:33.930> people<00:01:34.200> today<00:01:34.350> not

00:01:35.240 --> 00:01:35.250 
searchers like so many people today not

00:01:35.250 --> 00:01:37.070 
searchers like so many people today not
formally<00:01:36.000> tied<00:01:36.299> to<00:01:36.509> Christ<00:01:36.750> but<00:01:36.900> they're

00:01:37.070 --> 00:01:37.080 
formally tied to Christ but they're

00:01:37.080 --> 00:01:40.039 
formally tied to Christ but they're
searching<00:01:37.590> for<00:01:37.830> Christ<00:01:38.549> they<00:01:39.479> see<00:01:39.540> a<00:01:39.750> sign

00:01:40.039 --> 00:01:40.049

00:01:40.049 --> 00:01:43.820 
searching for Christ they see a sign
there's<00:01:40.950> the<00:01:41.130> star<00:01:41.400> the<00:01:41.700> the<00:01:41.939> the<00:01:42.590> sign<00:01:43.590> of

other religions I lay out really two
extremes<00:02:54.110> that<00:02:54.350> ought<00:02:54.860> to<00:02:54.890> be<00:02:55.040> avoided<00:02:55.550> the

00:02:56.140 --> 00:02:56.150 
extremes that ought to be avoided the

00:02:56.150 --> 00:02:58.480 
extremes that ought to be avoided the
one<00:02:56.360> is<00:02:56.600> a<00:02:56.630> sort<00:02:56.870> of<00:02:56.960> Christian<00:02:57.490> maximalism

00:02:58.480 --> 00:02:58.490 
one is a sort of Christian maximalism

00:02:58.490 --> 00:03:01.060 
one is a sort of Christian maximalism
that<00:02:58.820> would<00:02:58.940> say<00:02:59.180> we're<00:03:00.140> right<00:03:00.380> everybody

00:03:08.550 --> 00:03:08.560 
down the centuries find it even today

00:03:08.560 --> 00:03:11.230 
down the centuries find it even today
but<00:03:09.560> the<00:03:09.830> the<00:03:10.100> great<00:03:10.310> Catholic<00:03:10.580> tradition<00:03:11.120> has

00:03:11.230 --> 00:03:11.240 
but the the great Catholic tradition has

00:03:11.240 --> 00:03:13.270 
but the the great Catholic tradition has
