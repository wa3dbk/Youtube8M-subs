easy to get these foods in and you can

00:00:35.219 --> 00:00:36.620 
easy to get these foods in and you can
put<00:00:35.309> a<00:00:35.370> little<00:00:35.520> description<00:00:36.030> in<00:00:36.120> there<00:00:36.239> and

put a little description in there and

00:00:36.630 --> 00:00:37.760 
put a little description in there and
then<00:00:36.750> once<00:00:36.840> you<00:00:36.989> get<00:00:37.170> that<00:00:37.290> you<00:00:37.469> have<00:00:37.590> a<00:00:37.620> little

then once you get that you have a little

00:00:37.770 --> 00:00:39.170 
then once you get that you have a little
bit<00:00:37.920> of<00:00:38.070> a<00:00:38.129> gauge<00:00:38.309> of<00:00:38.520> what<00:00:38.670> the<00:00:38.790> child<00:00:39.030> is

00:01:16.249 --> 00:01:16.259 
we use a large number of studies that

00:01:16.259 --> 00:01:17.899 
we use a large number of studies that
we've<00:01:16.439> been<00:01:16.530> using<00:01:16.590> a<00:01:16.950> Kennedy<00:01:17.280> Krieger<00:01:17.460> for

00:01:17.899 --> 00:01:17.909 
we've been using a Kennedy Krieger for

00:01:17.909 --> 00:01:19.910 
we've been using a Kennedy Krieger for
over<00:01:18.240> 20<00:01:18.509> years<00:01:18.540> and<00:01:18.960> a<00:01:19.350> lot<00:01:19.560> of<00:01:19.619> these<00:01:19.770> are

00:01:19.910 --> 00:01:19.920 
over 20 years and a lot of these are

00:01:19.920 --> 00:01:21.200 
over 20 years and a lot of these are
actually<00:01:20.159> empirically<00:01:20.580> supported<00:01:20.759> they've

00:01:21.200 --> 00:01:21.210 
actually empirically supported they've

00:01:21.210 --> 00:01:23.120 
actually empirically supported they've
been<00:01:21.390> there's<00:01:22.259> outcome<00:01:22.560> studies<00:01:22.890> and

00:01:23.120 --> 00:01:23.130 
been there's outcome studies and

00:01:23.130 --> 00:01:25.100 
been there's outcome studies and
published<00:01:23.460> research<00:01:23.759> that<00:01:24.390> we've<00:01:24.509> done<00:01:24.689> and<00:01:24.900> I

00:01:25.100 --> 00:01:25.110 
published research that we've done and I

00:01:25.110 --> 00:01:26.950 
published research that we've done and I
think<00:01:25.560> there's<00:01:25.710> a<00:01:25.770> lot<00:01:25.920> that<00:01:25.950> parents<00:01:26.430> can<00:01:26.670> do

00:01:26.950 --> 00:01:26.960 
think there's a lot that parents can do

00:01:26.960 --> 00:01:29.929 
think there's a lot that parents can do
including<00:01:27.960> things<00:01:28.439> like<00:01:28.680> simple<00:01:29.189> things<00:01:29.549> for

00:01:29.929 --> 00:01:29.939 
including things like simple things for

00:01:29.939 --> 00:01:33.440 
including things like simple things for

taking those bites and then for a while
the<00:01:50.369> child's<00:01:50.670> not<00:01:50.790> going<00:01:50.939> to<00:01:51.000> really

00:01:51.109 --> 00:01:51.119 
the child's not going to really

00:01:51.119 --> 00:01:52.399 
the child's not going to really
necessarily<00:01:51.689> know<00:01:51.780> the<00:01:51.810> difference<00:01:52.290> and

00:01:52.399 --> 00:01:52.409 
necessarily know the difference and

00:01:52.409 --> 00:01:53.749 
necessarily know the difference and
before<00:01:52.979> you<00:01:53.100> know<00:01:53.189> it<00:01:53.340> it<00:01:53.430> starts<00:01:53.670> to<00:01:53.729> change

00:01:53.749 --> 00:01:53.759 
before you know it it starts to change

00:01:53.759 --> 00:01:55.999 
before you know it it starts to change
the<00:01:54.450> child's<00:01:54.689> been<00:01:54.930> taking<00:01:55.290> in<00:01:55.409> that<00:01:55.530> new<00:01:55.740> food

00:01:55.999 --> 00:01:56.009 
the child's been taking in that new food

00:01:56.009 --> 00:01:57.620 
the child's been taking in that new food
and<00:01:56.189> again<00:01:56.700> you've<00:01:56.850> gotten<00:01:57.119> to<00:01:57.210> that<00:01:57.329> next

00:01:57.620 --> 00:01:57.630 
and again you've gotten to that next

00:01:57.630 --> 00:01:59.840 
and again you've gotten to that next
step<00:01:57.869> and<00:01:58.140> I<00:01:58.439> think<00:01:58.469> that's<00:01:58.799> one<00:01:59.040> we<00:01:59.430> all<00:01:59.549> also

00:01:59.840 --> 00:01:59.850 
step and I think that's one we all also

00:01:59.850 --> 00:02:01.399 
step and I think that's one we all also
use<00:02:00.090> things<00:02:00.329> like<00:02:00.509> for<00:02:00.810> example<00:02:01.170> putting

00:02:01.399 --> 00:02:01.409 
use things like for example putting

00:02:01.409 --> 00:02:03.109 
use things like for example putting
foods<00:02:01.710> on<00:02:01.860> top<00:02:02.100> of<00:02:02.250> each<00:02:02.369> other<00:02:02.520> so<00:02:02.670> if<00:02:03.030> you

00:02:03.109 --> 00:02:03.119 
foods on top of each other so if you

00:02:03.119 --> 00:02:04.429 
foods on top of each other so if you
have<00:02:03.299> a<00:02:03.329> preferred<00:02:03.689> food<00:02:03.960> but<00:02:04.110> maybe<00:02:04.259> you

00:02:04.429 --> 00:02:04.439 
have a preferred food but maybe you

00:02:04.439 --> 00:02:06.319 
have a preferred food but maybe you
stick<00:02:04.680> the<00:02:04.829> bin'<00:02:05.399> on<00:02:05.520> preferred<00:02:05.820> food<00:02:06.119> right

00:02:06.319 --> 00:02:06.329 
stick the bin' on preferred food right

00:02:06.329 --> 00:02:07.850 
stick the bin' on preferred food right
in<00:02:06.420> the<00:02:06.479> back<00:02:06.659> you<00:02:07.200> know<00:02:07.259> and<00:02:07.409> now<00:02:07.469> just<00:02:07.740> a

00:02:07.850 --> 00:02:07.860 
in the back you know and now just a

00:02:07.860 --> 00:02:09.440 
in the back you know and now just a
little<00:02:07.890> piece<00:02:08.310> and<00:02:08.580> you'll<00:02:08.759> say<00:02:08.970> just<00:02:09.300> you

00:02:09.440 --> 00:02:09.450 
little piece and you'll say just you

00:02:09.450 --> 00:02:10.639 
little piece and you'll say just you
just<00:02:09.569> have<00:02:09.720> to<00:02:09.840> finish<00:02:09.989> this<00:02:10.110> piece<00:02:10.440> and<00:02:10.590> you

00:02:10.639 --> 00:02:10.649 
just have to finish this piece and you

00:02:10.649 --> 00:02:12.440 
just have to finish this piece and you
kind<00:02:10.860> of<00:02:10.890> go<00:02:11.009> in<00:02:11.129> there<00:02:11.280> it's<00:02:11.730> really<00:02:11.879> about

00:02:12.440 --> 00:02:12.450 
kind of go in there it's really about

00:02:12.450 --> 00:02:13.850 
kind of go in there it's really about
exposure<00:02:12.959> because<00:02:13.260> many

00:02:13.850 --> 00:02:13.860 
exposure because many

00:02:13.860 --> 00:02:16.370 
exposure because many
the<00:02:14.040> kids<00:02:14.280> have<00:02:14.610> never<00:02:14.850> tried<00:02:15.240> it<00:02:15.270> they<00:02:15.930> may<00:02:16.110> if

00:02:16.370 --> 00:02:16.380 
the kids have never tried it they may if

00:02:16.380 --> 00:02:18.350 
the kids have never tried it they may if
they're<00:02:16.560> able<00:02:16.710> to<00:02:16.890> report<00:02:17.340> I<00:02:17.520> don't<00:02:17.820> like<00:02:17.970> it<00:02:18.210> I

00:02:18.350 --> 00:02:18.360 
they're able to report I don't like it I

00:02:18.360 --> 00:02:19.700 
they're able to report I don't like it I
don't<00:02:18.390> want<00:02:18.750> it<00:02:18.870> tastes<00:02:19.290> better<00:02:19.470> they've

00:02:19.700 --> 00:02:19.710 
don't want it tastes better they've

00:02:19.710 --> 00:02:21.920 
don't want it tastes better they've
never<00:02:19.860> had<00:02:20.130> it<00:02:20.370> so<00:02:20.550> it's<00:02:21.210> amazing<00:02:21.420> once<00:02:21.810> you

00:02:21.920 --> 00:02:21.930 
never had it so it's amazing once you

00:02:21.930 --> 00:02:23.210 
never had it so it's amazing once you
see<00:02:22.080> them<00:02:22.260> get<00:02:22.440> it<00:02:22.560> in<00:02:22.650> there<00:02:22.800> and<00:02:22.860> they<00:02:22.950> start

00:02:23.210 --> 00:02:23.220 
see them get it in there and they start

00:02:23.220 --> 00:02:24.500 
see them get it in there and they start
to<00:02:23.310> chew<00:02:23.490> and<00:02:23.640> it<00:02:23.730> goes<00:02:23.880> down<00:02:24.090> and<00:02:24.300> that<00:02:24.420> they

00:02:24.500 --> 00:02:24.510 
to chew and it goes down and that they

00:02:24.510 --> 00:02:25.820 
to chew and it goes down and that they
feel<00:02:24.690> a<00:02:24.720> little<00:02:24.930> better<00:02:25.140> and<00:02:25.290> then<00:02:25.410> as<00:02:25.500> you<00:02:25.680> go

00:02:25.820 --> 00:02:25.830 
feel a little better and then as you go

00:02:25.830 --> 00:02:27.410 
feel a little better and then as you go
you<00:02:25.890> increase<00:02:26.400> it<00:02:26.580> and<00:02:26.730> you<00:02:26.880> keep<00:02:27.060> going<00:02:27.210> a

00:02:27.410 --> 00:02:27.420 
you increase it and you keep going a

00:02:27.420 --> 00:02:29.570 
you increase it and you keep going a
little<00:02:27.630> further<00:02:27.780> and<00:02:28.020> further<00:02:28.340> I'd<00:02:29.340> also

00:02:29.570 --> 00:02:29.580 
little further and further I'd also

00:02:29.580 --> 00:02:32.150 
little further and further I'd also
recommend<00:02:29.880> starting<00:02:30.510> small<00:02:30.840> you<00:02:31.590> know<00:02:31.710> if<00:02:32.010> you

00:02:32.150 --> 00:02:32.160 
recommend starting small you know if you

00:02:32.160 --> 00:02:34.190 
recommend starting small you know if you
try<00:02:32.340> to<00:02:32.460> say<00:02:32.730> a<00:02:32.760> child<00:02:33.090> has<00:02:33.300> never<00:02:33.540> had<00:02:33.780> you

00:02:34.190 --> 00:02:34.200 
try to say a child has never had you

00:02:34.200 --> 00:02:36.140 
try to say a child has never had you
know<00:02:34.290> a<00:02:34.320> vegetable<00:02:34.920> and<00:02:35.100> also<00:02:35.790> and<00:02:35.880> you<00:02:35.940> put<00:02:36.120> a

00:02:36.140 --> 00:02:36.150 
know a vegetable and also and you put a

00:02:36.150 --> 00:02:38.000 
know a vegetable and also and you put a
whole<00:02:36.390> you<00:02:36.720> know<00:02:36.840> piece<00:02:37.350> of<00:02:37.470> broccoli<00:02:37.650> on

00:02:38.000 --> 00:02:38.010 
whole you know piece of broccoli on

00:02:38.010 --> 00:02:39.290 
whole you know piece of broccoli on
there<00:02:38.190> that's<00:02:38.370> probably<00:02:38.760> not<00:02:38.910> going<00:02:39.060> to<00:02:39.120> go

00:02:39.290 --> 00:02:39.300 
there that's probably not going to go

00:02:39.300 --> 00:02:41.060 
there that's probably not going to go
well<00:02:39.510> but<00:02:39.900> if<00:02:39.990> you<00:02:40.020> put<00:02:40.290> a<00:02:40.320> little<00:02:40.470> piece<00:02:40.800> and

00:02:41.060 --> 00:02:41.070 
well but if you put a little piece and

00:02:41.070 --> 00:02:43.010 
well but if you put a little piece and
maybe<00:02:41.550> you<00:02:41.700> provide<00:02:42.060> some<00:02:42.330> incentive<00:02:42.780> saying

00:02:43.010 --> 00:02:43.020 
maybe you provide some incentive saying

00:02:43.020 --> 00:02:44.510 
maybe you provide some incentive saying
if<00:02:43.080> you<00:02:43.200> take<00:02:43.440> this<00:02:43.590> you<00:02:43.770> can<00:02:43.920> have<00:02:44.040> access<00:02:44.250> to

00:02:44.510 --> 00:02:44.520 
if you take this you can have access to

00:02:44.520 --> 00:02:47.260 
if you take this you can have access to
your<00:02:44.940> preferred<00:02:45.240> item<00:02:45.660> or<00:02:46.050> preferred<00:02:46.680> food

00:02:47.260 --> 00:02:47.270 
your preferred item or preferred food

00:02:47.270 --> 00:02:49.250 
your preferred item or preferred food
you<00:02:48.270> might<00:02:48.420> get<00:02:48.660> it<00:02:48.780> in<00:02:48.870> there<00:02:49.020> and<00:02:49.140> like<00:02:49.230> I

00:02:49.250 --> 00:02:49.260 
you might get it in there and like I
