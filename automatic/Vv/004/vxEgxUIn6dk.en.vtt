00:02:12.860 --> 00:02:12.870 
it's a very rare ecosystem most people

00:02:12.870 --> 00:02:14.510 
it's a very rare ecosystem most people
think<00:02:12.990> of<00:02:13.110> the<00:02:13.170> tropical<00:02:13.710> rainforest<00:02:14.280> when<00:02:14.430> we

00:02:14.510 --> 00:02:14.520 
think of the tropical rainforest when we

00:02:14.520 --> 00:02:16.880 
think of the tropical rainforest when we
talk<00:02:14.700> about<00:02:14.730> rain<00:02:15.120> for<00:02:15.330> us<00:02:15.360> but<00:02:15.600> it's<00:02:15.720> 36<00:02:16.530> times

00:02:16.880 --> 00:02:16.890 
talk about rain for us but it's 36 times

00:02:16.890 --> 00:02:19.370 
talk about rain for us but it's 36 times
more<00:02:17.250> rare<00:02:17.670> than<00:02:18.000> the<00:02:18.390> tropical<00:02:18.810> rainforest

00:02:19.370 --> 00:02:19.380 
more rare than the tropical rainforest

00:02:19.380 --> 00:02:20.990 
more rare than the tropical rainforest
so<00:02:19.560> it's<00:02:19.980> pretty<00:02:20.220> lucky<00:02:20.370> that<00:02:20.580> we<00:02:20.760> get<00:02:20.910> to

00:02:20.990 --> 00:02:21.000

00:02:21.000 --> 00:02:22.940 
so it's pretty lucky that we get to
explore<00:02:21.270> it<00:02:21.450> here<00:02:21.660> so<00:02:22.320> if<00:02:22.440> you<00:02:22.530> look<00:02:22.740> up<00:02:22.890> here
