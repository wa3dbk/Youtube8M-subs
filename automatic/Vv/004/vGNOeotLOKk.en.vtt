00:00:02.320 --> 00:00:06.270
 Hmm 

00:00:04.750 --> 00:00:09.969
 tee 

00:00:06.270 --> 00:00:14.320
 I No Aike tour this time also went 

00:00:09.969 --> 00:00:19.509
 This time I have come to this time It is the appearance of the Yamaneko this time 

00:00:14.320 --> 00:00:25.390
 I have come to the enthusiasm to invite you to follow the Naughty General but it is very cute so I support it 

00:00:19.509 --> 00:00:29.380
 Let's let's Yeah Would you go more of it in the game 

00:00:25.390 --> 00:00:33.340
 Now h , this time of the beginning Hey this time also started 

00:00:29.380 --> 00:00:37.329
 Yamane stiff-chan does it come to what kind of movement this 

00:00:33.340 --> 00:00:41.010
 The wild cat is surprisingly surprised to say 

00:00:37.329 --> 00:00:41.010
 I am told it is 

00:00:41.150 --> 00:00:50.960
 The point is that zombies are not quicker 

00:00:45.380 --> 00:00:51.710
 Not fairly compete for before zombie praised iron I'd thought I blame that 

00:00:50.960 --> 00:00:57.950
 is not it 

00:00:51.710 --> 00:00:59.380
 Surprisingly wildcat if we'll also lend this is Well after zombie 50.1 handicap 

00:00:57.950 --> 00:01:05.110
 There is a high 

00:00:59.380 --> 00:01:06.310
 Quite another spawn and wait doing and what will do but I wonder if Ikeru fight against is and cats image 

00:01:05.110 --> 00:01:11.720
 right 

00:01:06.310 --> 00:01:12.659
 I do not understand the curving route now I do not understand I really fast 

00:01:11.720 --> 00:01:15.749
 No 6 

00:01:12.659 --> 00:01:20.490
 Zotto is well dispersed and the number is decreasing further 

00:01:15.749 --> 00:01:23.819
 After all the microspoon also stopped Hey this is a subtle battle 

00:01:20.490 --> 00:01:26.920
 No, this is a little fun 

00:01:23.819 --> 00:01:33.270
 There are many zombies love 

00:01:26.920 --> 00:01:33.270
 I wonder if I can do my best from there, Yamaneko-chan worked hard with my ears. 

00:01:35.050 --> 00:01:43.490
 Of which 32 it began with a woman I began the match day 

00:01:39.159 --> 00:01:48.200
 Zombie've decided also the first run firmly 

00:01:43.490 --> 00:01:52.189
 Well still there is a sense of stability , but there is also a part that becomes tense in the first game in comparison with that 

00:01:48.200 --> 00:01:57.289
 I think, but it looks like you are quite nervous 

00:01:52.189 --> 00:02:02.330
 Yes, but I think that I was able to get infected with zombies along the way . 

00:01:57.289 --> 00:02:03.480
 It's quite a good move, but in the first game it's right I answered, but still there is 

00:02:02.330 --> 00:02:08.130
 That side 

00:02:03.480 --> 00:02:09.520
 Compatibility with quite equipped After looking into the can and what I want to do my best Well I'd think that good 

00:02:08.130 --> 00:02:12.620
 It is close 

00:02:09.520 --> 00:02:17.720
 How about zombies this time 

00:02:12.620 --> 00:02:21.769
 Even though this Nader doesn't break even though it's three minutes, it seems that it is quite now. 

00:02:17.720 --> 00:02:27.920
 It is dispersed from the water and I want to go well here and attack Mariko here though 

00:02:21.769 --> 00:02:32.610
 Is not it had been a little reduced the number to the mother or zombie by Well of the plurality 

00:02:27.920 --> 00:02:36.510
 Preface wear the zombies alone in Mino Mariko alone 

00:02:32.610 --> 00:02:38.310
 The rest is pushing a zombie more than once This is a typical zonbei's remedy, but this 

00:02:36.510 --> 00:02:44.220
 Yamaneko thinks wonderful 

00:02:38.310 --> 00:02:47.760
 No, it started raining How about getting married This is because I am not good at watering 

00:02:44.220 --> 00:02:48.819
 But it is interesting even if it has decreased from this zombie This it is my 

00:02:47.760 --> 00:02:52.100
 Oh 

00:02:48.819 --> 00:02:55.780
 How is this not? 

00:02:52.100 --> 00:03:01.200
 I got it, this is it. 

00:02:55.780 --> 00:03:01.200
 Oh I worked hard in the wonderful little mountain this 

00:03:01.600 --> 00:03:09.610
 Come on a kids' extra game 

00:03:05.230 --> 00:03:12.820
 The extra battle has been over- one cat has returned one 

00:03:09.610 --> 00:03:13.790
 Then you fought against the Soho 

00:03:12.820 --> 00:03:18.349
 Yes 

00:03:13.790 --> 00:03:24.530
 Yes saying winning the sometimes on the spear Hung firm 

00:03:18.349 --> 00:03:26.220
 About it a little when I said in the same idea to the mountain this came surprise ending Earl unexpected 

00:03:24.530 --> 00:03:31.500
 strength 

00:03:26.220 --> 00:03:32.190
 This No to the compatibility is good I too Kotome is please by all means buy the wildcat 

00:03:31.500 --> 00:03:34.940

00:03:32.190 --> 00:03:38.600
 But from that are dispersed doing It's Come this way 

00:03:34.940 --> 00:03:42.320
 Well how to make a minute search is professional 

00:03:38.600 --> 00:03:44.480
 I think this is a little zombie transparency , but zombies here too firmly 

00:03:42.320 --> 00:03:50.750
 I would like to do my best 

00:03:44.480 --> 00:03:54.440
 I 'll let you say goodbye, but if you say the public money in the wildcat, it's great, really 

00:03:50.750 --> 00:03:54.930
 A typical way to deal with Japan Randy Yarosupon 

00:03:54.440 --> 00:03:59.640
 Is this 

00:03:54.930 --> 00:04:00.390
 It is How about this is that this number does not wipe it with a little mountain done Narikiri also Mashi goods ｰｰｰ 

00:03:59.640 --> 00:04:04.020
