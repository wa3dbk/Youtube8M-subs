just curved lines like that and you draw

00:00:49.860 --> 00:00:52.450 
just curved lines like that and you draw
an<00:00:49.920> eye<00:00:50.100> which<00:00:50.370> takes<00:00:50.700> up<00:00:50.850> the<00:00:50.969> whole<00:00:51.000> face<00:00:51.360> and

an eye which takes up the whole face and

00:00:52.460 --> 00:00:54.979 
an eye which takes up the whole face and
you<00:00:53.460> fill<00:00:53.730> it<00:00:53.879> in<00:00:53.969> with<00:00:54.180> two<00:00:54.210> circles<00:00:54.719> and

00:00:54.979 --> 00:00:54.989 
you fill it in with two circles and

00:00:54.989 --> 00:00:58.689 
you fill it in with two circles and
color<00:00:55.379> and<00:00:55.590> the<00:00:55.649> rest<00:00:55.860> to<00:00:56.870> add<00:00:57.870> the<00:00:58.050> nose<00:00:58.260> I

00:00:58.689 --> 00:00:58.699 
color and the rest to add the nose I

00:00:58.699 --> 00:01:04.870 
color and the rest to add the nose I
just<00:00:59.699> add<00:00:59.940> a<00:00:59.969> little<00:01:00.329> circle<00:01:00.930> there<00:01:00.960> and<00:01:03.049> then

00:01:04.870 --> 00:01:04.880 
just add a little circle there and then

00:01:04.880 --> 00:01:07.550 
just add a little circle there and then
you<00:01:05.880> can<00:01:06.000> decorate<00:01:06.210> the<00:01:06.600> body<00:01:06.810> by<00:01:07.110> adding

00:01:07.550 --> 00:01:07.560 
you can decorate the body by adding

00:01:07.560 --> 00:01:13.070 
you can decorate the body by adding
things<00:01:07.920> like<00:01:08.159> polka<00:01:08.970> dots<00:01:11.090> or<00:01:12.090> stripes<00:01:12.570> if<00:01:13.049> you

00:01:13.070 --> 00:01:13.080

00:01:22.969 --> 00:01:22.979 

00:01:22.979 --> 00:01:29.370 

and<00:01:23.979> I<00:01:24.070> just<00:01:24.310> do<00:01:24.460> that<00:01:24.670> by<00:01:25.439> making<00:01:26.549> some<00:01:28.380> half

00:01:29.370 --> 00:01:29.380 
and I just do that by making some half

00:01:29.380 --> 00:01:31.920 
and I just do that by making some half
circles<00:01:30.009> circles<00:01:30.460> that<00:01:31.000> are<00:01:31.060> smaller<00:01:31.420> inside

00:01:31.920 --> 00:01:31.930 
circles circles that are smaller inside

00:01:31.930 --> 00:01:38.340 
circles circles that are smaller inside
things<00:01:32.560> like<00:01:32.740> that<00:01:36.540> then<00:01:37.540> you<00:01:37.720> have<00:01:37.750> one<00:01:38.170> more

00:01:38.340 --> 00:01:38.350 
things like that then you have one more

00:01:38.350 --> 00:01:41.580 
things like that then you have one more
step<00:01:38.649> and<00:01:38.920> that<00:01:39.369> is<00:01:39.430> to<00:01:39.880> add<00:01:40.000> the<00:01:40.149> feet<00:01:40.360> I<00:01:40.659> add

00:01:41.580 --> 00:01:41.590 
step and that is to add the feet I add

00:01:41.590 --> 00:01:48.300 
step and that is to add the feet I add
about<00:01:43.080> three<00:01:44.080> or<00:01:44.200> four<00:01:45.450> legs<00:01:46.450> per<00:01:47.310> body

00:01:48.300 --> 00:01:48.310 
about three or four legs per body

00:01:48.310 --> 00:01:51.719 
about three or four legs per body
segment<00:01:49.380> depending<00:01:50.380> on<00:01:50.590> how<00:01:51.070> much<00:01:51.220> space<00:01:51.549> I

00:01:51.719 --> 00:01:51.729 
segment depending on how much space I

00:01:51.729 --> 00:01:59.270 
segment depending on how much space I
have<00:01:55.679> and<00:01:56.789> there<00:01:57.789> you<00:01:57.880> go<00:01:58.030> that's<00:01:58.450> how<00:01:58.630> to<00:01:58.780> draw

00:01:59.270 --> 00:01:59.280 
have and there you go that's how to draw

00:01:59.280 --> 00:02:04.080 
have and there you go that's how to draw
cartoon<00:02:00.280> caterpillar<00:02:00.850> I<00:02:01.090> hope<00:02:01.659> you<00:02:01.840> like<00:02:02.050> it
