00:03:41.689 --> 00:03:41.699 
week I kind of had a small problem where

00:03:41.699 --> 00:03:47.740 
week I kind of had a small problem where
the<00:03:42.919> decline<00:03:44.030> coming<00:03:45.030> around<00:03:45.239> here<00:03:46.729> basically

00:03:47.740 --> 00:03:47.750 
the decline coming around here basically

00:03:47.750 --> 00:03:52.009 
the decline coming around here basically
was<00:03:48.750> too<00:03:48.959> steep<00:03:49.319> and<00:03:49.620> the<00:03:50.489> one<00:03:50.900> section<00:03:51.900> or

00:03:52.009 --> 00:03:52.019 
was too steep and the one section or

00:03:52.019 --> 00:03:53.360 
was too steep and the one section or
track<00:03:52.260> that<00:03:52.440> goes<00:03:52.530> between<00:03:52.709> there<00:03:53.099> and<00:03:53.129> there

00:03:53.360 --> 00:03:53.370 
track that goes between there and there

00:03:53.370 --> 00:03:55.670 
track that goes between there and there
was<00:03:53.579> actually<00:03:53.970> like<00:03:54.150> this<00:03:54.449> so<00:03:54.750> I<00:03:54.930> had<00:03:55.470> anything

00:03:55.670 --> 00:03:55.680 
was actually like this so I had anything

00:03:55.680 --> 00:03:57.979 
was actually like this so I had anything
coming<00:03:56.159> around<00:03:56.459> and<00:03:56.729> kind<00:03:57.120> of<00:03:57.239> had<00:03:57.389> a<00:03:57.419> hump<00:03:57.750> and

00:03:57.979 --> 00:03:57.989 
coming around and kind of had a hump and

00:03:57.989 --> 00:04:00.199 
coming around and kind of had a hump and
a<00:03:58.470> lot<00:03:58.979> of<00:03:59.099> things<00:03:59.250> are<00:03:59.459> getting<00:03:59.669> beat<00:03:59.849> a<00:03:59.879> lot

00:04:00.199 --> 00:04:00.209 
a lot of things are getting beat a lot

00:04:00.209 --> 00:04:03.559 
a lot of things are getting beat a lot
of<00:04:00.299> things<00:04:00.510> were<00:04:00.659> drilling<00:04:01.260> so<00:04:02.449> basically<00:04:03.449> I

00:04:03.559 --> 00:04:03.569 
of things were drilling so basically I

00:04:03.569 --> 00:04:07.670 
of things were drilling so basically I
ripped<00:04:04.260> it<00:04:04.379> up<00:04:04.530> from<00:04:05.340> the<00:04:05.729> turnout<00:04:06.409> back<00:04:07.409> to

00:04:07.670 --> 00:04:07.680 
ripped it up from the turnout back to

00:04:07.680 --> 00:04:11.830 
ripped it up from the turnout back to
about<00:04:07.949> here<00:04:08.720> shimmed<00:04:09.720> it<00:04:10.579> reglued<00:04:11.579> it

00:04:11.830 --> 00:04:11.840 
about here shimmed it reglued it

00:04:11.840 --> 00:04:14.509 
about here shimmed it reglued it
obviously<00:04:12.840> add<00:04:13.049> a<00:04:13.079> little<00:04:13.290> bit<00:04:13.440> more<00:04:13.620> support

00:04:14.509 --> 00:04:14.519 
obviously add a little bit more support

00:04:14.519 --> 00:04:18.020 
obviously add a little bit more support
and<00:04:14.760> then<00:04:15.569> once<00:04:16.409> I<00:04:16.590> got<00:04:16.620> a<00:04:16.769> few<00:04:17.190> good<00:04:17.400> runs<00:04:17.609> with

00:04:18.020 --> 00:04:18.030 
and then once I got a few good runs with

00:04:18.030 --> 00:04:20.000 
and then once I got a few good runs with
the<00:04:18.239> flat<00:04:18.750> cars<00:04:19.019> and<00:04:19.229> a<00:04:19.260> few<00:04:19.440> good<00:04:19.560> runs<00:04:19.739> with

00:04:20.000 --> 00:04:20.010 
the flat cars and a few good runs with

00:04:20.010 --> 00:04:23.719
