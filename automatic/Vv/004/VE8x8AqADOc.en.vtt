00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:06.089
 charlotte and welcome to the first 

00:00:02.780 --> 00:00:07.259
 december video today yes I explain to you 

00:00:06.089 --> 00:00:09.240
 the whole time I have this often 

00:00:07.259 --> 00:00:12.559
 twitter announced and indeed there is one 

00:00:09.240 --> 00:00:12.559
 little special I'd say 

00:00:19.100 --> 00:00:27.570
 and from the first to the 24th of december 

00:00:24.539 --> 00:00:28.590
 I ask a small question in each video 

00:00:27.570 --> 00:00:32.730
 fade in 

00:00:28.590 --> 00:00:34.110
 and yes that will be somewhere in the video 

00:00:32.730 --> 00:00:35.130
 So not really hiding 

00:00:34.110 --> 00:00:36.809
 to fade in 

00:00:35.130 --> 00:00:42.510
 that means you have the videos already 

00:00:36.809 --> 00:00:46.950
 end look around then the whole mist the 

00:00:42.510 --> 00:00:49.050
 videos already to the end look around the 

00:00:46.950 --> 00:00:51.000
 to get whole questions 

00:00:49.050 --> 00:00:52.680
 so if you ask about it 

00:00:51.000 --> 00:00:54.000
 must of course now be as 

00:00:52.680 --> 00:00:54.660
 First you watch the video and this one 

00:00:54.000 --> 00:01:02.329
 question 

00:00:54.660 --> 00:01:04.320
 I care no idea when did 

00:01:02.329 --> 00:01:07.790
 I take that as an example 

00:01:04.320 --> 00:01:10.890
 I do not want to take anything too hard now 

00:01:07.790 --> 00:01:14.040
 or what that could really be like 

00:01:10.890 --> 00:01:16.500
 example how many eggs from how many 

00:01:14.040 --> 00:01:18.560
 swear who is in the us 

00:01:16.500 --> 00:01:20.250
 because the swords two diaz of course 

00:01:18.560 --> 00:01:22.619
 that we will eventually video 

00:01:20.250 --> 00:01:23.909
 visible teams see this and yes 

00:01:22.619 --> 00:01:27.180
 then you have to go to a website 

00:01:23.909 --> 00:01:28.729
 the left beats point tk is synonymous 

00:01:27.180 --> 00:01:30.869
 again in the video description 

00:01:28.729 --> 00:01:33.210
 thanks to normal here really 

00:01:30.869 --> 00:01:34.740
 Next he gave me the page on one 

00:01:33.210 --> 00:01:36.170
 last night or a few 

00:01:34.740 --> 00:01:38.159
 hours 

00:01:36.170 --> 00:01:39.780
 I think so because there is another 

00:01:38.159 --> 00:01:43.890
 to dust and we can down right now 

00:01:39.780 --> 00:01:46.920
 are provided me the next decade mega 

00:01:43.890 --> 00:01:48.360
 well programmed a few hours and yes 

00:01:46.920 --> 00:01:51.630
 really thank you thank you again 

00:01:48.360 --> 00:01:53.399
 you omega omega correct and on her mega 

00:01:51.630 --> 00:01:54.799
 cool that gives cool cool special 

00:01:53.399 --> 00:01:59.909
 Because of you, I'll say it 

00:01:54.799 --> 00:02:01.890
 and yes that is a internet site as 

00:01:59.909 --> 00:02:03.000
 I would first I register 

00:02:01.890 --> 00:02:05.159
 maybe something will become a song 

00:02:03.000 --> 00:02:06.479
 Let's see in any case, I think 

00:02:05.159 --> 00:02:08.700
 this will also be a case registered by you 

00:02:06.479 --> 00:02:13.650
 with the e-mail address 

00:02:08.700 --> 00:02:16.440
 username and and a password 

00:02:13.650 --> 00:02:19.470
 of course and you can only do it once 

00:02:16.440 --> 00:02:21.420
 so per ip halt computer login 

00:02:19.470 --> 00:02:22.950
 that is, so if you take once 

00:02:21.420 --> 00:02:24.480
 really director right address 

00:02:22.950 --> 00:02:27.030
 mark you that even if I could not 

00:02:24.480 --> 00:02:28.349
 again the second sign and all 

00:02:27.030 --> 00:02:30.630
 the important thing is that you always 

00:02:28.349 --> 00:02:32.459
 We always give you logged in 

00:02:30.630 --> 00:02:34.380
 log in yes he logs you there 

00:02:32.459 --> 00:02:36.180
 with yours and so on and then you see 

00:02:34.380 --> 00:02:39.810
 you have such a table from day one to 

00:02:36.180 --> 00:02:41.190
 day 24 so day one is the first video 

00:02:39.810 --> 00:02:44.790
 here in december on the first december what 

00:02:41.190 --> 00:02:48.420
 comes out and stop that here 

00:02:44.790 --> 00:03:00.299
 is a question objected his old 

00:02:48.420 --> 00:03:03.630
 no chance no chance place or ice 

00:03:00.299 --> 00:03:05.730
 the mega was mega white what it was for 

00:03:03.630 --> 00:03:09.239
 a sword I do not know in gold 

00:03:05.730 --> 00:03:15.980
 worth it so ok I have the texture 

00:03:09.239 --> 00:03:15.980
 pack of things on the way 

00:03:16.050 --> 00:03:21.840
 I have the texture pack 2 at night 

00:03:18.270 --> 00:03:24.600
 texture pack of spex in it and that's why 

00:03:21.840 --> 00:03:25.590
 I do not know what everything is but me 

00:03:24.600 --> 00:03:27.810
 guess we so should still 

00:03:25.590 --> 00:03:29.190
 the next days to get along well 

00:03:27.810 --> 00:03:31.800
 registered on her case you can see here 

00:03:29.190 --> 00:03:33.810
 Such a thing from 1 to 24 acts 

00:03:31.800 --> 00:03:37.050
 day one day is just the video here 

00:03:33.810 --> 00:03:39.330
 comes from the first december and there 

00:03:37.050 --> 00:03:40.230
 you have to just come to the whole 

00:03:39.330 --> 00:03:49.350
 make travel difficult 

00:03:40.230 --> 00:03:51.750
 I believe that is better than that 

00:03:49.350 --> 00:03:53.640
 i better than gold turner boss 1 yes good 

00:03:51.750 --> 00:03:55.740
 In any case, then you write the 

00:03:53.640 --> 00:03:57.360
 answer by day individually for the question 

00:03:55.740 --> 00:03:59.070
 which now somewhere in the video appears 

00:03:57.360 --> 00:04:01.650
 Let's say we were eating as an example 

00:03:59.070 --> 00:04:04.440
 many diamonds confirm you 

00:04:01.650 --> 00:04:11.280
 So say the question then you have to stop 

00:04:04.440 --> 00:04:12.750
 write down at day 12 and if you like that 

00:04:11.280 --> 00:04:15.060
 then you have clicked down below 

00:04:12.750 --> 00:04:16.380
 Save and then your question 

00:04:15.060 --> 00:04:19.109
 I can see what we have there 

00:04:16.380 --> 00:04:21.840
 wrote down and yes it does so 

00:04:19.109 --> 00:04:23.460
 lasting 24 days and who at the end of the 24th 

00:04:21.840 --> 00:04:26.790
 most people ask correctly 

00:04:23.460 --> 00:04:29.910
 has answered then win then come 

00:04:26.790 --> 00:04:31.590
 the premium for a month and now 

00:04:29.910 --> 00:04:33.840
 you ask yourself what if several or 

00:04:31.590 --> 00:04:38.910
 so the question did not answer that 

00:04:33.840 --> 00:04:40.980
 will not be like that because I have it like that 

00:04:38.910 --> 00:04:42.330
 I made that so that I'm off 

00:04:40.980 --> 00:04:42.930
 and also so appreciate questions 

00:04:42.330 --> 00:04:48.770
 reinbringen 

00:04:42.930 --> 00:04:50.970
 that means oh my god how do we get 

00:04:48.770 --> 00:04:54.020
 that I sometimes ask so appreciated 

00:04:50.970 --> 00:04:54.020
 to bring in that means 

00:05:02.599 --> 00:05:10.499
 now you have to go away that means eg one 

00:05:05.490 --> 00:05:13.819
 guess which nobody really knows what 

00:05:10.499 --> 00:05:13.819
 For example, white is really nobody 

00:05:14.689 --> 00:05:18.509
 as bavaria is really for example that 

00:05:17.189 --> 00:05:27.960
 it already happens but as an example 

00:05:18.509 --> 00:05:30.330
 now then when I gave it to his 

00:05:27.960 --> 00:05:31.020
 I have birthday and you know 

00:05:30.330 --> 00:05:32.340
 that they do not hold true 

00:05:31.020 --> 00:05:33.900
 jay jay has definitely birthday 

00:05:32.340 --> 00:05:37.080
 good dogs with her you do not know because 

00:05:33.900 --> 00:05:39.599
 I have birthday and then write 

00:05:37.080 --> 00:05:41.550
 for example, 24 december is yes 

00:05:39.599 --> 00:05:43.919
 christmas stop now as an example and 

00:05:41.550 --> 00:05:45.539
 But if I am at 520 december 

00:05:43.919 --> 00:05:47.400
 birthday has been relatively close 

00:05:45.539 --> 00:05:48.539
 get close to it one day 

00:05:47.400 --> 00:05:49.830
 probably that you then the point 

00:05:48.539 --> 00:05:50.719
 I get it or the right one 

00:05:49.830 --> 00:05:53.099
 answer for that 

00:05:50.719 --> 00:05:55.110
 and if one writes then because they 

00:05:53.099 --> 00:05:58.169
 not only there then january then it is 

00:05:55.110 --> 00:05:59.639
 Farther away from 420 december where I am 

00:05:58.169 --> 00:06:01.860
 birthday is now as an example 

00:05:59.639 --> 00:06:03.300
 and then it's the next one 

00:06:01.860 --> 00:06:04.439
 is gonna get the point that is 

00:06:03.300 --> 00:06:05.189
 I get out of the question now and then 

00:06:04.439 --> 00:06:08.879
 with bring in 

00:06:05.189 --> 00:06:10.710
 And that's really a winner 

00:06:08.879 --> 00:06:12.199
 then in the end and then always easy 

00:06:10.710 --> 00:06:14.430
 for day 2 

00:06:12.199 --> 00:06:16.110
 the question in the second video so 

00:06:14.430 --> 00:06:17.789
 tomorrow then in the next video comes 

00:06:16.110 --> 00:06:19.409
 answer and so you can every day 

00:06:17.789 --> 00:06:21.330
 always log in and your answer 

00:06:19.409 --> 00:06:22.889
 save others and yes as I said 

00:06:21.330 --> 00:06:25.229
 then the most correct answer 

00:06:22.889 --> 00:06:28.500
 At the end of the 24 days it gets 

00:06:25.229 --> 00:06:31.439
 come hde a month ago from 

00:06:28.500 --> 00:06:32.610

00:06:31.439 --> 00:06:33.779
 If I have something sponsored there 

00:06:32.610 --> 00:06:35.370
 get from the paradise server when i am 

00:06:33.779 --> 00:06:36.870
 I say it pretty much myself and 

00:06:35.370 --> 00:06:38.849

00:06:36.870 --> 00:06:41.129
