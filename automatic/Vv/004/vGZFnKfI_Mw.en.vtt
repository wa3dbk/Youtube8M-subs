00:00:02.570 --> 00:00:06.700
 It is a moment a moment 

00:00:09.330 --> 00:00:14.880
 Tsu 

00:00:10.400 --> 00:00:18.240
 A typical Japanese snack is sushi 

00:00:14.880 --> 00:00:23.900
 The shop that eats this sushi is a sushi shop 

00:00:18.240 --> 00:00:23.900
 Most of the Japanese have a butt in front of this store 

00:00:24.140 --> 00:00:34.340
 This is the entrance of sushi left from three eyes in passing under a short curtain that this goodwill 

00:00:31.070 --> 00:00:37.730
 To the right of the cut diagonally to 48 degrees 

00:00:34.340 --> 00:00:39.490
 Place the back of your hand on the raised part 3.2 inches 

00:00:37.730 --> 00:00:46.340
 I will 

00:00:39.490 --> 00:00:47.910
 new If the store exceeds 30 minutes before the expected closing time, we still do 

00:00:46.340 --> 00:00:52.980
 Still doing 

00:00:47.910 --> 00:00:55.140
 I'm still doing it I will not forget to say 

00:00:52.980 --> 00:00:58.590
 I am a shopkeeper 

00:00:55.140 --> 00:01:02.300
 Two people but this represents the number of people 

00:00:58.590 --> 00:01:06.380
 Similarly in the case of 3 people it is 3 people 

00:01:02.300 --> 00:01:13.300
 In the case of 4 people say it is 4 people 

00:01:06.380 --> 00:01:17.140
 However, in the case of one person, it is the point to show some apology with eyes 

00:01:13.300 --> 00:01:20.470
 It is best to use the counter when you come to a sushi shop 

00:01:17.140 --> 00:01:25.450
 But I can not afford to sit down 

00:01:20.470 --> 00:01:30.820
 In Japan that respects etiquette, it is here to the next customer who has always come ahead 

00:01:25.450 --> 00:01:33.290
 OK or sound this is the word to check vacancies 

00:01:30.820 --> 00:01:36.680
 Call out to the customer rather than in Spain 

00:01:33.290 --> 00:01:41.150
 Is the Japanese way of law and humanity style 

00:01:36.680 --> 00:01:47.990
 On the contrary, if it is said that you are right here and there is an empty seat 

00:01:41.150 --> 00:01:51.040
 Please feel free to say that you have to sit at the counter for the first time after getting through 

00:01:47.990 --> 00:01:51.040
 Can do 

00:01:51.840 --> 00:02:04.090
 It is finally an order There is no waiter or waitress in the sushi shop 

00:01:57.900 --> 00:02:07.390
 Then the customer will order the desired menu directly to the master 

00:02:04.090 --> 00:02:10.509
 Main menu is the same at any sushi shop 

00:02:07.390 --> 00:02:14.080
 Large Toro in a typical menu 

00:02:10.509 --> 00:02:18.790
 There is Tolo This represents the quality of tuna 

00:02:14.080 --> 00:02:24.080
 Daitoro is very delicious, containing a lot of the finest oil 

00:02:18.790 --> 00:02:28.370
 The US is also using the Koshihikari of the top luxury brand called Shirley 

00:02:24.080 --> 00:02:32.060
 On the other hand followers are junk food for low-income people 

00:02:28.370 --> 00:02:37.210
 Fish uses recycled products and does not use rice 

00:02:32.060 --> 00:02:37.210
 I have used fake rice chopped wheat and pasta 

00:02:37.730 --> 00:02:44.530
 beer 

00:02:39.250 --> 00:02:45.610
 Beer is a popular drink menu You can skip the battle, but pour self-service 

00:02:44.530 --> 00:02:50.350
 is 

00:02:45.610 --> 00:02:54.130
 It is manner in Japan to pour in each other in the case of two or more people 

00:02:50.350 --> 00:02:58.130
 If you are in a business relationship, the current person is the superior 

00:02:54.130 --> 00:03:01.610
 It is determined important that pour earlier Well Well Well Well 

00:02:58.130 --> 00:03:06.440
 This is a word you must say when pouring 

00:03:01.610 --> 00:03:15.160
 I will say my husband when I am complimented as well 

00:03:06.440 --> 00:03:20.800

00:03:15.160 --> 00:03:24.460
 In the case of couples , women pour themselves into men and women pour themselves 

00:03:20.800 --> 00:03:31.020
 I see, it's a samurai country, sushi is 

00:03:24.460 --> 00:03:34.600
 With confidence because we use the ones that were disinfected, which will be issued and put into digit eaten sushi 

00:03:31.020 --> 00:03:35.180
 Some people enter this as it is and return 

00:03:34.600 --> 00:03:39.950
 Many 

00:03:35.180 --> 00:03:45.520
 It is for this reason that the smell of vinegar from the Japanese feet of 

00:03:39.950 --> 00:03:45.520
 This is a hunt The material is a mystery 

00:03:47.400 --> 00:03:54.900

 The amount of soy sauce sushi is not decided yet 

00:04:07.520 --> 00:04:12.790
 Let's soak in enough until the weight changes 

00:04:19.090 --> 00:04:22.620
 This is a guideline 

00:04:23.460 --> 00:04:31.190
 We raise chin 45 degrees in front and eat with one bite 

00:04:28.880 --> 00:04:33.440

 Wipe at hand of wet towel to hand in the marked with a rice and fish smell

 This will be a woman used for various purposes called rags 

00:04:50.229 --> 00:04:56.490
 The cutting floor is also blown with this cloth 

00:04:53.620 --> 00:05:02.160
 I do not wash for a while if I use it once 

00:04:56.490 --> 00:05:05.460
 The Japanese spirit that values things also appears in these places 

00:05:02.160 --> 00:05:13.330
 This person is a technician who makes sushi 

00:05:05.460 --> 00:05:16.409

 If you enjoy sushi for a while, you will express a sense of gratitude to the subject 

00:05:23.510 --> 00:05:32.740
 Whether the sushi served or not 

00:05:27.790 --> 00:05:37.240
 Let's say it's a good subject 

00:05:32.740 --> 00:05:40.780
 The restaurant manager also recommends the sushi restaurant as well as the restaurant 

00:05:37.240 --> 00:05:46.539

 Recommended recommendations for the possibility of those designated as International Protected Animals in the face of bad value awards 

00:05:59.240 --> 00:06:04.690
 It is the plan of the Japanese to enjoy and finish 

00:06:04.940 --> 00:06:14.690
 It is said that the post-meal tea service is up

 This is a signal of accounting It means that you can go to your store 

00:06:41.420 --> 00:06:48.200
 This way of wanting to account is because you insist that you are in a better position 

00:06:47.120 --> 00:06:51.800
 is 

00:06:48.200 --> 00:06:54.970

 It is a samurai country 

00:06:55.729 --> 00:07:03.199

 There is plenty of use outside of the store for those who have run out of salt 

00:07:25.950 --> 00:07:33.060
 Free service so eat freely 

00:07:29.430 --> 00:07:38.210
 This is the only space where you can talk in earnest 

00:07:33.060 --> 00:07:38.210
 This timing is better if there is to apologize 

00:07:41.390 --> 00:07:46.120
