lot of you guys have seen our will like
kits<00:00:12.440> on<00:00:12.800> some<00:00:13.520> of<00:00:13.610> the<00:00:13.670> two-wheel<00:00:14.030> bikes<00:00:14.330> and

00:00:14.770 --> 00:00:14.780 
kits on some of the two-wheel bikes and

00:00:14.780 --> 00:00:17.800 
kits on some of the two-wheel bikes and
we've<00:00:15.650> recently<00:00:15.889> made<00:00:16.370> a<00:00:16.400> development<00:00:17.030> we're

00:00:17.800 --> 00:00:17.810 
we've recently made a development we're

00:00:17.810 --> 00:00:19.000 
we've recently made a development we're
now<00:00:17.930> you'd<00:00:18.110> be<00:00:18.230> able<00:00:18.380> to<00:00:18.440> put<00:00:18.590> it<00:00:18.710> on<00:00:18.800> your

00:00:19.000 --> 00:00:19.010 
now you'd be able to put it on your

00:00:19.010 --> 00:00:20.770 
now you'd be able to put it on your
spider<00:00:19.280> so<00:00:19.910> what<00:00:20.060> we're<00:00:20.180> gonna<00:00:20.240> do<00:00:20.510> is<00:00:20.630> we're

00:00:20.770 --> 00:00:20.780 
spider so what we're gonna do is we're

00:00:20.780 --> 00:00:24.010 
spider so what we're gonna do is we're
gonna<00:00:20.869> go<00:00:21.050> through<00:00:21.380> a<00:00:21.410> short<00:00:21.950> video<00:00:22.640> and<00:00:23.020> show

gonna go through a short video and show
you<00:00:24.050> how<00:00:24.530> an<00:00:24.740> installation<00:00:25.340> is<00:00:25.460> done<00:00:27.040> okay

00:00:28.030 --> 00:00:28.040 
you how an installation is done okay

00:00:28.040 --> 00:00:29.410 
you how an installation is done okay
what<00:00:28.220> we've<00:00:28.370> done<00:00:28.610> here<00:00:28.880> is<00:00:29.000> we've<00:00:29.180> already

00:00:29.410 --> 00:00:29.420 
what we've done here is we've already

00:00:29.420 --> 00:00:33.330 
what we've done here is we've already
removed<00:00:29.930> the<00:00:30.290> wheel<00:00:30.530> from<00:00:31.310> one<00:00:31.760> side<00:00:32.059> of<00:00:32.450> the

00:00:33.330 --> 00:00:33.340 
removed the wheel from one side of the

00:00:33.340 --> 00:00:37.000 
removed the wheel from one side of the
of<00:00:34.340> the<00:00:34.489> bike<00:00:34.700> and<00:00:35.210> what<00:00:36.140> we're<00:00:36.260> gonna<00:00:36.350> do<00:00:36.620> is

00:00:37.000 --> 00:00:37.010 
of the bike and what we're gonna do is

00:00:37.010 --> 00:00:39.520 
of the bike and what we're gonna do is
show<00:00:37.309> you<00:00:37.370> how<00:00:37.850> we've<00:00:38.390> laced<00:00:38.839> a<00:00:39.140> particular

00:00:39.520 --> 00:00:39.530 
show you how we've laced a particular

00:00:39.530 --> 00:00:42.090 
show you how we've laced a particular
wheel<00:00:40.010> doesn't<00:00:40.519> mean<00:00:40.789> how<00:00:40.999> you<00:00:41.059> have<00:00:41.539> to<00:00:41.749> do<00:00:41.870> it

00:00:42.090 --> 00:00:42.100 
wheel doesn't mean how you have to do it

00:00:42.100 --> 00:00:44.590 
wheel doesn't mean how you have to do it
this<00:00:43.100> is<00:00:43.280> only<00:00:43.399> a<00:00:43.519> guideline<00:00:43.820> this<00:00:44.449> is

00:00:44.590 --> 00:00:44.600 
this is only a guideline this is

00:00:44.600 --> 00:00:46.360 
this is only a guideline this is
something<00:00:44.989> that<00:00:45.140> you<00:00:45.859> have<00:00:45.980> to<00:00:46.100> spend<00:00:46.280> a

00:00:46.360 --> 00:00:46.370 
something that you have to spend a

00:00:46.370 --> 00:00:48.009 
something that you have to spend a
little<00:00:46.460> time<00:00:46.789> to<00:00:47.089> think<00:00:47.329> it<00:00:47.480> out<00:00:47.600> make<00:00:47.989> sure

00:00:48.009 --> 00:00:48.019 
little time to think it out make sure

00:00:48.019 --> 00:00:49.660 
little time to think it out make sure
you<00:00:48.379> understand<00:00:48.890> where<00:00:49.219> are<00:00:49.280> you<00:00:49.339> gonna<00:00:49.489> run

00:00:49.660 --> 00:00:49.670 
you understand where are you gonna run

00:00:49.670 --> 00:00:50.770 
you understand where are you gonna run
your<00:00:49.789> wires<00:00:49.999> and<00:00:50.269> how<00:00:50.390> you're<00:00:50.539> gonna<00:00:50.600> mount

00:00:50.770 --> 00:00:50.780 
your wires and how you're gonna mount

00:00:50.780 --> 00:00:53.500 
your wires and how you're gonna mount
your<00:00:50.989> LEDs<00:00:51.440> now<00:00:52.429> on<00:00:52.640> this<00:00:52.819> particular<00:00:53.089> wheel

00:00:53.500 --> 00:00:53.510 
your LEDs now on this particular wheel

00:00:53.510 --> 00:00:55.540 
your LEDs now on this particular wheel
what<00:00:53.899> we've<00:00:54.079> done<00:00:54.319> is<00:00:54.469> we've<00:00:54.649> actually<00:00:54.859> you

00:00:55.540 --> 00:00:55.550 
what we've done is we've actually you

00:00:55.550 --> 00:00:58.090 
what we've done is we've actually you
can<00:00:55.730> run<00:00:55.940> the<00:00:56.059> wires<00:00:56.989> internally<00:00:57.949> or

00:00:58.090 --> 00:00:58.100 
can run the wires internally or

00:00:58.100 --> 00:01:01.540 
can run the wires internally or
externally<00:00:58.239> on<00:00:59.239> this<00:00:59.960> one<00:01:00.260> we<00:01:00.920> ran<00:01:01.280> them

00:01:01.540 --> 00:01:01.550 
externally on this one we ran them

00:01:01.550 --> 00:01:03.250 
externally on this one we ran them
internally<00:01:02.179> and<00:01:02.390> we'll<00:01:02.479> show<00:01:02.690> you<00:01:02.719> how<00:01:02.870> we'll

00:01:03.250 --> 00:01:03.260 
internally and we'll show you how we'll

00:01:03.260 --> 00:01:11.109 
internally and we'll show you how we'll
pop<00:01:03.440> the<00:01:03.589> cap<00:01:03.829> off<00:01:04.070> the<00:01:04.280> center<00:01:08.920> and<00:01:10.119> you'll

00:01:11.109 --> 00:01:11.119 
pop the cap off the center and you'll

00:01:11.119 --> 00:01:17.260 
pop the cap off the center and you'll
see<00:01:12.399> where<00:01:13.399> we<00:01:13.640> have<00:01:13.670> the<00:01:13.850> wires<00:01:16.060> coming<00:01:17.060> out

00:01:17.260 --> 00:01:17.270 
see where we have the wires coming out

00:01:17.270 --> 00:01:22.450 
see where we have the wires coming out
through<00:01:17.600> a<00:01:17.630> hole<00:01:17.930> in<00:01:17.960> the<00:01:18.290> wheel<00:01:21.070> now<00:01:22.070> what<00:01:22.310> we

00:01:22.450 --> 00:01:22.460 
through a hole in the wheel now what we

00:01:22.460 --> 00:01:27.600 
through a hole in the wheel now what we
did<00:01:22.729> will<00:01:23.210> zoom<00:01:23.479> in<00:01:23.659> on<00:01:23.840> this<00:01:23.990> a<00:01:24.049> little<00:01:24.259> bit

00:01:27.600 --> 00:01:27.610 

00:01:27.610 --> 00:01:29.499 

there<00:01:28.610> you<00:01:28.729> go<00:01:28.850> right<00:01:29.030> there

00:01:29.499 --> 00:01:29.509 
there you go right there

00:01:29.509 --> 00:01:31.660 
there you go right there
if<00:01:30.110> you<00:01:30.590> see<00:01:30.829> that<00:01:31.009> we've<00:01:31.159> drilled<00:01:31.490> a<00:01:31.640> hole

00:01:31.660 --> 00:01:31.670 
if you see that we've drilled a hole

00:01:31.670 --> 00:01:35.560 
if you see that we've drilled a hole
from<00:01:32.539> the<00:01:32.600> center<00:01:33.140> of<00:01:33.320> the<00:01:33.680> wheel<00:01:33.920> out<00:01:34.570> to

00:01:35.560 --> 00:01:35.570 
from the center of the wheel out to

00:01:35.570 --> 00:01:38.279 
from the center of the wheel out to
where<00:01:35.810> we<00:01:36.020> have<00:01:36.320> the<00:01:37.100> wires<00:01:37.369> coming<00:01:37.909> through

00:01:38.279 --> 00:01:38.289 
where we have the wires coming through

00:01:38.289 --> 00:01:40.929 
where we have the wires coming through
now<00:01:39.289> again<00:01:39.649> this<00:01:39.859> is<00:01:39.920> something<00:01:40.369> you<00:01:40.520> can<00:01:40.729> do

00:01:40.929 --> 00:01:40.939 
now again this is something you can do

00:01:40.939 --> 00:01:43.389 
now again this is something you can do
or<00:01:41.539> you<00:01:41.750> can<00:01:41.960> run<00:01:42.140> them<00:01:42.289> externally<00:01:43.009> we'll<00:01:43.219> get

00:01:43.389 --> 00:01:43.399 
or you can run them externally we'll get

00:01:43.399 --> 00:01:45.520 
or you can run them externally we'll get
to<00:01:43.609> that<00:01:43.759> in<00:01:43.909> a<00:01:44.000> minute<00:01:44.149> now<00:01:44.899> you<00:01:45.020> can<00:01:45.140> see<00:01:45.380> how

00:01:45.520 --> 00:01:45.530 
to that in a minute now you can see how

00:01:45.530 --> 00:01:48.249 
to that in a minute now you can see how
we<00:01:45.590> have<00:01:45.920> all<00:01:46.369> the<00:01:46.909> wires<00:01:47.119> running<00:01:47.630> out<00:01:47.810> to<00:01:48.140> the

00:01:48.249 --> 00:01:48.259 
we have all the wires running out to the

00:01:48.259 --> 00:01:51.490 
we have all the wires running out to the
separate<00:01:48.649> LEDs<00:01:49.100> the<00:01:49.969> LEDs<00:01:50.359> are<00:01:50.600> held<00:01:50.810> in<00:01:51.049> with

00:01:51.490 --> 00:01:51.500 
separate LEDs the LEDs are held in with

00:01:51.500 --> 00:01:54.219 
separate LEDs the LEDs are held in with
double<00:01:51.890> stick<00:01:52.100> tape<00:01:52.159> and<00:01:52.640> even<00:01:53.509> the<00:01:53.600> wires<00:01:53.840> are

00:01:54.219 --> 00:01:54.229 
double stick tape and even the wires are

00:01:54.229 --> 00:01:56.319 
double stick tape and even the wires are
held<00:01:54.619> on<00:01:54.799> to<00:01:55.130> the<00:01:55.219> wheel<00:01:55.399> with<00:01:55.789> double<00:01:56.149> stick

00:01:56.319 --> 00:01:56.329 
held on to the wheel with double stick

00:01:56.329 --> 00:01:59.800 
held on to the wheel with double stick
tape<00:01:57.369> the<00:01:58.369> important<00:01:58.880> thing<00:01:59.090> here<00:01:59.119> is<00:01:59.600> that

00:01:59.800 --> 00:01:59.810 
tape the important thing here is that

00:01:59.810 --> 00:02:02.590 
tape the important thing here is that
you<00:02:00.079> really<00:02:00.829> really<00:02:01.670> make<00:02:01.999> sure<00:02:02.030> that<00:02:02.270> you

00:02:02.590 --> 00:02:02.600 
you really really make sure that you

00:02:02.600 --> 00:02:04.929 
you really really make sure that you
clean<00:02:02.960> everything<00:02:03.229> ahead<00:02:04.039> of<00:02:04.159> time<00:02:04.340> the

00:02:04.929 --> 00:02:04.939 
clean everything ahead of time the

00:02:04.939 --> 00:02:06.730 
clean everything ahead of time the
double<00:02:05.270> stick<00:02:05.479> will<00:02:05.630> do<00:02:05.749> more<00:02:06.109> than<00:02:06.619> an

00:02:06.730 --> 00:02:06.740 
double stick will do more than an

00:02:06.740 --> 00:02:08.950 
double stick will do more than an
adequate<00:02:07.189> job<00:02:07.429> but<00:02:08.179> if<00:02:08.270> you<00:02:08.390> don't<00:02:08.660> clean<00:02:08.929> it

00:02:08.950 --> 00:02:08.960 
adequate job but if you don't clean it

00:02:08.960 --> 00:02:10.840 
adequate job but if you don't clean it
ahead<00:02:09.200> of<00:02:09.320> time<00:02:09.440> the<00:02:09.890> double<00:02:10.190> stick<00:02:10.399> sticks<00:02:10.700> to

00:02:10.840 --> 00:02:10.850 
ahead of time the double stick sticks to

00:02:10.850 --> 00:02:12.520 
ahead of time the double stick sticks to
dirt<00:02:11.060> and<00:02:11.240> dirts<00:02:11.780> not<00:02:12.020> going<00:02:12.170> to<00:02:12.230> stick<00:02:12.380> to

dirt and dirts not going to stick to

00:02:12.530 --> 00:02:15.320 
dirt and dirts not going to stick to
your<00:02:12.620> wheels

00:02:15.320 --> 00:02:15.330 

00:02:15.330 --> 00:02:17.480 

all<00:02:16.170> right<00:02:16.320> what's<00:02:16.500> also<00:02:16.710> important<00:02:17.340> is<00:02:17.430> that

00:02:17.480 --> 00:02:17.490 
all right what's also important is that

00:02:17.490 --> 00:02:19.760 
all right what's also important is that
when<00:02:17.790> you<00:02:17.970> apply<00:02:18.360> the<00:02:18.420> LEDs<00:02:19.050> and<00:02:19.290> the<00:02:19.380> double

00:02:19.760 --> 00:02:19.770 
when you apply the LEDs and the double

00:02:19.770 --> 00:02:22.490 
when you apply the LEDs and the double
stick<00:02:20.010> is<00:02:20.250> that<00:02:20.760> you<00:02:20.910> do<00:02:21.090> it<00:02:21.270> in<00:02:21.420> a<00:02:21.720> warm<00:02:22.110> dry

00:02:22.490 --> 00:02:22.500 
stick is that you do it in a warm dry

00:02:22.500 --> 00:02:28.460 
stick is that you do it in a warm dry
place<00:02:24.740> preferably<00:02:26.240> eighty<00:02:27.240> degrees<00:02:27.780> is<00:02:28.170> the

00:02:28.460 --> 00:02:28.470 
place preferably eighty degrees is the

00:02:28.470 --> 00:02:32.030 
place preferably eighty degrees is the
best<00:02:28.980> you<00:02:29.700> can<00:02:29.940> go<00:02:30.180> down<00:02:30.390> to<00:02:30.420> 50<00:02:30.990> but<00:02:31.290> we<00:02:31.680> found

00:02:32.030 --> 00:02:32.040 
best you can go down to 50 but we found

00:02:32.040 --> 00:02:34.310 
best you can go down to 50 but we found
that<00:02:32.160> our<00:02:32.310> best<00:02:32.550> results<00:02:33.150> are<00:02:33.360> the<00:02:33.930> warmer

00:02:34.310 --> 00:02:34.320 
that our best results are the warmer

00:02:34.320 --> 00:02:37.190 
that our best results are the warmer
that<00:02:34.500> you<00:02:34.620> get<00:02:34.830> it<00:02:34.950> the<00:02:35.130> better<00:02:35.480> now<00:02:36.480> if<00:02:36.900> you

00:02:37.190 --> 00:02:37.200 
that you get it the better now if you

00:02:37.200 --> 00:02:39.920 
that you get it the better now if you
look<00:02:37.500> around<00:02:38.070> the<00:02:38.340> outside<00:02:39.090> of<00:02:39.510> the<00:02:39.720> rim

00:02:39.920 --> 00:02:39.930 
look around the outside of the rim

00:02:39.930 --> 00:02:44.570 
look around the outside of the rim
you'll<00:02:40.920> see<00:02:41.250> that<00:02:41.790> we<00:02:41.970> have<00:02:42.180> two<00:02:42.780> strips<00:02:43.580> that

00:02:44.570 --> 00:02:44.580 
you'll see that we have two strips that

00:02:44.580 --> 00:02:46.460 
you'll see that we have two strips that
are<00:02:44.730> tied<00:02:44.970> together<00:02:45.240> bridge<00:02:45.810> together<00:02:46.050> in<00:02:46.380> the

00:02:46.460 --> 00:02:46.470 
are tied together bridge together in the

00:02:46.470 --> 00:02:51.530 
are tied together bridge together in the
back<00:02:46.650> and<00:02:47.540> those<00:02:48.540> are<00:02:48.750> six<00:02:49.290> LEDs<00:02:49.950> each<00:02:50.250> in<00:02:50.670> this

00:02:51.530 --> 00:02:51.540 
back and those are six LEDs each in this

00:02:51.540 --> 00:02:54.380 
back and those are six LEDs each in this
particular<00:02:51.870> case<00:02:52.320> one<00:02:52.950> strip<00:02:53.310> is<00:02:53.490> red<00:02:53.790> one

00:02:54.380 --> 00:02:54.390 
particular case one strip is red one

00:02:54.390 --> 00:02:57.260 
particular case one strip is red one
strip<00:02:54.750> is<00:02:54.900> amber<00:02:55.320> so<00:02:56.130> that<00:02:56.370> when<00:02:56.640> it's<00:02:56.820> in

00:02:57.260 --> 00:02:57.270 
strip is amber so that when it's in

00:02:57.270 --> 00:02:59.570 
strip is amber so that when it's in
motion<00:02:57.840> it<00:02:57.930> gives<00:02:58.080> you<00:02:58.200> a<00:02:58.260> bit<00:02:58.410> of<00:02:58.530> a<00:02:58.650> fiery

00:02:59.570 --> 00:02:59.580 
motion it gives you a bit of a fiery

00:02:59.580 --> 00:03:03.860 
motion it gives you a bit of a fiery
look<00:03:00.380> then<00:03:01.380> if<00:03:01.530> you<00:03:01.650> go<00:03:01.830> to<00:03:01.890> the<00:03:02.250> hub<00:03:02.870> you'll

00:03:03.860 --> 00:03:03.870 
look then if you go to the hub you'll

00:03:03.870 --> 00:03:07.220 
look then if you go to the hub you'll
see<00:03:04.170> that<00:03:04.410> we've<00:03:04.620> got<00:03:05.090> three<00:03:06.090> facing<00:03:06.690> inside

00:03:07.220 --> 00:03:07.230 
see that we've got three facing inside

00:03:07.230 --> 00:03:09.730 
see that we've got three facing inside
and<00:03:07.650> then<00:03:08.310> once<00:03:08.520> we<00:03:08.700> turn<00:03:08.910> the<00:03:09.030> wheel<00:03:09.180> around

00:03:09.730 --> 00:03:09.740 
and then once we turn the wheel around

00:03:09.740 --> 00:03:12.770 
and then once we turn the wheel around
you'll<00:03:10.740> see<00:03:10.950> that<00:03:11.100> we<00:03:11.220> have<00:03:11.400> three<00:03:11.880> facing

00:03:12.770 --> 00:03:12.780 
you'll see that we have three facing

00:03:12.780 --> 00:03:13.460 
you'll see that we have three facing
outside

00:03:13.460 --> 00:03:13.470 
outside

00:03:13.470 --> 00:03:16.070 
outside
they<00:03:14.340> basically<00:03:14.880> alternate<00:03:15.660> between<00:03:15.840> the

00:03:16.070 --> 00:03:16.080 
they basically alternate between the

00:03:16.080 --> 00:03:18.500 
they basically alternate between the
spokes<00:03:16.470> of<00:03:16.620> the<00:03:16.680> wheels<00:03:16.920> and<00:03:17.300> again<00:03:18.300> we've

00:03:18.500 --> 00:03:18.510 
spokes of the wheels and again we've

00:03:18.510 --> 00:03:20.630 
spokes of the wheels and again we've
done<00:03:18.690> the<00:03:18.810> same<00:03:19.020> thing<00:03:19.350> there<00:03:19.590> where<00:03:20.430> we've

00:03:20.630 --> 00:03:20.640 
done the same thing there where we've

00:03:20.640 --> 00:03:23.750 
done the same thing there where we've
alternated<00:03:21.450> red<00:03:21.870> and<00:03:22.200> amber<00:03:22.410> so<00:03:23.340> that<00:03:23.489> you<00:03:23.610> get

00:03:23.750 --> 00:03:23.760 
alternated red and amber so that you get

00:03:23.760 --> 00:03:29.600 
alternated red and amber so that you get
a<00:03:23.790> pretty<00:03:24.420> cool<00:03:24.600> effect<00:03:27.950> okay<00:03:28.950> again<00:03:29.280> on<00:03:29.430> this

00:03:29.600 --> 00:03:29.610 
a pretty cool effect okay again on this

00:03:29.610 --> 00:03:31.699 
a pretty cool effect okay again on this
wheel<00:03:29.820> I<00:03:29.850> want<00:03:30.150> to<00:03:30.209> point<00:03:30.510> out<00:03:30.690> how<00:03:31.019> we<00:03:31.080> drilled

00:03:31.699 --> 00:03:31.709 
wheel I want to point out how we drilled

00:03:31.709 --> 00:03:35.720 
wheel I want to point out how we drilled
the<00:03:32.130> hole<00:03:33.650> internal<00:03:34.650> to<00:03:34.830> the<00:03:34.950> wheel<00:03:35.160> we'll<00:03:35.550> get

00:03:35.720 --> 00:03:35.730 
the hole internal to the wheel we'll get

00:03:35.730 --> 00:03:37.130 
the hole internal to the wheel we'll get
to<00:03:35.850> how<00:03:35.940> you<00:03:36.000> can<00:03:36.180> run<00:03:36.360> in<00:03:36.450> an<00:03:36.540> external<00:03:36.810> in<00:03:37.050> a

00:03:37.130 --> 00:03:37.140 
to how you can run in an external in a

00:03:37.140 --> 00:03:39.590 
to how you can run in an external in a
minute<00:03:37.440> now<00:03:38.280> this<00:03:38.519> hole<00:03:38.760> right<00:03:39.180> now<00:03:39.360> is<00:03:39.510> about

00:03:39.590 --> 00:03:39.600 
minute now this hole right now is about

00:03:39.600 --> 00:03:43.100 
minute now this hole right now is about
a<00:03:39.720> 5/16<00:03:40.709> diameter<00:03:41.280> hole<00:03:41.690> for<00:03:42.690> any<00:03:42.780> of<00:03:42.870> the<00:03:42.930> guys

00:03:43.100 --> 00:03:43.110 
a 5/16 diameter hole for any of the guys

00:03:43.110 --> 00:03:44.479 
a 5/16 diameter hole for any of the guys
that<00:03:43.320> want<00:03:43.500> to<00:03:43.590> say<00:03:43.709> well<00:03:43.920> you<00:03:44.160> know<00:03:44.250> that's

00:03:44.479 --> 00:03:44.489 
that want to say well you know that's

00:03:44.489 --> 00:03:46.910 
that want to say well you know that's
gonna<00:03:44.670> that's<00:03:45.180> gonna<00:03:45.330> put<00:03:45.660> a<00:03:45.690> fracture<00:03:46.650> point

00:03:46.910 --> 00:03:46.920 
gonna that's gonna put a fracture point

00:03:46.920 --> 00:03:49.729 
gonna that's gonna put a fracture point
in<00:03:47.040> the<00:03:47.130> wheel<00:03:47.340> no<00:03:47.760> that's<00:03:48.090> not<00:03:48.360> true<00:03:48.739> because

00:03:49.729 --> 00:03:49.739 
in the wheel no that's not true because

00:03:49.739 --> 00:03:52.820 
in the wheel no that's not true because
if<00:03:49.860> you<00:03:50.010> look<00:03:50.220> at<00:03:50.370> the<00:03:50.580> actual<00:03:51.300> mounting<00:03:52.050> holes

00:03:52.820 --> 00:03:52.830 
if you look at the actual mounting holes

00:03:52.830 --> 00:03:55.759 
if you look at the actual mounting holes
in<00:03:53.100> the<00:03:53.220> wheel<00:03:53.630> the<00:03:54.630> wheels<00:03:54.840> being<00:03:55.170> held<00:03:55.530> under

00:03:55.759 --> 00:03:55.769 
in the wheel the wheels being held under

00:03:55.769 --> 00:03:58.009 
in the wheel the wheels being held under
compression<00:03:56.580> through<00:03:57.030> those<00:03:57.330> three<00:03:57.720> there's

00:03:58.009 --> 00:03:58.019 
compression through those three there's

00:03:58.019 --> 00:04:02.120 
compression through those three there's
really<00:03:58.440> absolutely<00:03:58.830> no<00:03:59.519> load<00:04:00.920> around<00:04:01.920> the

00:04:02.120 --> 00:04:02.130 
really absolutely no load around the

00:04:02.130 --> 00:04:05.570 
really absolutely no load around the
diameter<00:04:02.790> of<00:04:02.970> this<00:04:03.420> bore<00:04:04.040> now<00:04:05.040> like<00:04:05.430> I<00:04:05.519> said

00:04:05.570 --> 00:04:05.580 
diameter of this bore now like I said

00:04:05.580 --> 00:04:08.600 
diameter of this bore now like I said
that's<00:04:05.880> about<00:04:06.090> a<00:04:06.170> 5/16<00:04:07.170> hole<00:04:07.350> and<00:04:07.709> we<00:04:07.920> ran<00:04:08.220> I

00:04:08.600 --> 00:04:08.610 
that's about a 5/16 hole and we ran I

00:04:08.610 --> 00:04:10.400 
that's about a 5/16 hole and we ran I
don't<00:04:09.120> know<00:04:09.180> there's<00:04:09.390> probably<00:04:09.690> about<00:04:09.989> six

00:04:10.400 --> 00:04:10.410 
don't know there's probably about six

00:04:10.410 --> 00:04:12.440 
don't know there's probably about six
wires<00:04:10.680> coming<00:04:11.100> through<00:04:11.340> there<00:04:11.549> there's<00:04:12.209> no

00:04:12.440 --> 00:04:12.450 
wires coming through there there's no

00:04:12.450 --> 00:04:14.060 
wires coming through there there's no
need<00:04:12.660> to<00:04:12.690> really<00:04:13.080> do<00:04:13.200> this<00:04:13.410> either<00:04:13.680> you<00:04:13.890> can

00:04:14.060 --> 00:04:14.070 
need to really do this either you can

00:04:14.070 --> 00:04:17.270 
need to really do this either you can
tie<00:04:14.310> them<00:04:14.519> all<00:04:14.730> together<00:04:15.500> on<00:04:16.500> the<00:04:16.709> outside

00:04:17.270 --> 00:04:17.280 
tie them all together on the outside

00:04:17.280 --> 00:04:20.150 
tie them all together on the outside
before<00:04:17.790> you<00:04:18.269> run<00:04:18.510> them<00:04:18.750> in<00:04:18.959> towards<00:04:19.530> the<00:04:19.680> axle

00:04:20.150 --> 00:04:20.160 
before you run them in towards the axle

00:04:20.160 --> 00:04:23.090 
before you run them in towards the axle
and<00:04:20.370> only<00:04:20.940> have<00:04:21.180> two<00:04:22.080> wires<00:04:22.350> coming<00:04:22.830> through

00:04:23.090 --> 00:04:23.100 
and only have two wires coming through

00:04:23.100 --> 00:04:25.940 
and only have two wires coming through
one<00:04:23.610> positive<00:04:23.910> one<00:04:24.210> negative<00:04:24.450> and<00:04:25.050> then<00:04:25.770> your

00:04:25.940 --> 00:04:25.950 
one positive one negative and then your

00:04:25.950 --> 00:04:28.010 
one positive one negative and then your
hole<00:04:26.100> can<00:04:26.310> be<00:04:26.430> much<00:04:26.700> smaller<00:04:27.030> probably<00:04:27.780> about

00:04:28.010 --> 00:04:28.020 
hole can be much smaller probably about

00:04:28.020 --> 00:04:28.570 
hole can be much smaller probably about
an<00:04:28.350> A

00:04:28.570 --> 00:04:28.580 
an A

of an inch or so now the other thing to
know<00:04:31.460> if<00:04:31.849> you're<00:04:32.270> gonna<00:04:32.389> do<00:04:32.599> it<00:04:32.750> this<00:04:32.900> way<00:04:33.139> is

00:04:33.429 --> 00:04:33.439 
know if you're gonna do it this way is

00:04:33.439 --> 00:04:36.879 
know if you're gonna do it this way is
if<00:04:34.220> you<00:04:34.370> notice<00:04:34.610> where<00:04:35.599> the<00:04:35.960> position<00:04:36.139> on<00:04:36.710> the

00:04:36.879 --> 00:04:36.889 
if you notice where the position on the

00:04:36.889 --> 00:04:39.129 
if you notice where the position on the

00:04:39.129 --> 00:04:39.139 
inside of the bore that hole comes

00:04:39.139 --> 00:04:41.830 
inside of the bore that hole comes
through<00:04:39.500> what's<00:04:40.460> important<00:04:41.090> here<00:04:41.389> is<00:04:41.449> that

00:04:41.830 --> 00:04:41.840 
through what's important here is that

00:04:41.840 --> 00:04:44.980 
through what's important here is that
it's<00:04:42.050> far<00:04:42.439> enough<00:04:42.590> inside<00:04:43.400> the<00:04:43.669> bore<00:04:43.990> towards

00:05:15.490 --> 00:05:15.500 
inch all right the other way that you

00:05:15.500 --> 00:05:17.520 
inch all right the other way that you
can<00:05:15.680> run<00:05:15.979> your<00:05:16.099> wires<00:05:16.370> like<00:05:16.729> we've<00:05:16.940> said<00:05:17.240> is

00:05:17.520 --> 00:05:17.530 
can run your wires like we've said is

00:05:17.530 --> 00:05:20.320 
can run your wires like we've said is
externally<00:05:18.530> now<00:05:19.190> here<00:05:19.460> we've<00:05:19.639> popped<00:05:19.969> the<00:05:20.120> cap

00:05:20.320 --> 00:05:20.330 
externally now here we've popped the cap

00:05:20.330 --> 00:05:23.230 
externally now here we've popped the cap
off<00:05:20.719> and<00:05:21.370> what<00:05:22.370> you<00:05:22.490> would<00:05:22.639> do<00:05:22.759> is<00:05:22.909> you<00:05:23.029> take

00:05:23.230 --> 00:05:23.240 
off and what you would do is you take

00:05:23.240 --> 00:05:26.709 
off and what you would do is you take
this<00:05:23.449> cap<00:05:23.719> and<00:05:23.990> cut<00:05:24.169> a<00:05:24.199> small<00:05:24.469> notch<00:05:24.979> in<00:05:25.250> it<00:05:25.719> so

00:05:26.709 --> 00:05:26.719 
this cap and cut a small notch in it so

00:05:26.719 --> 00:05:28.119 
this cap and cut a small notch in it so
that<00:05:26.900> you<00:05:26.990> can<00:05:27.169> bring<00:05:27.439> the<00:05:27.590> wires<00:05:27.800> out

00:05:28.119 --> 00:05:28.129 
that you can bring the wires out

00:05:28.129 --> 00:05:31.659 
that you can bring the wires out
underneath<00:05:28.759> it<00:05:28.969> and<00:05:29.529> then<00:05:30.529> from<00:05:30.830> here<00:05:30.860> you'd

00:05:31.659 --> 00:05:31.669 
underneath it and then from here you'd

00:05:31.669 --> 00:05:33.700 
underneath it and then from here you'd
run<00:05:32.000> them<00:05:32.210> out<00:05:32.419> along<00:05:32.840> the<00:05:33.020> face<00:05:33.229> of<00:05:33.469> the<00:05:33.529> wheel

00:05:33.700 --> 00:05:33.710 
run them out along the face of the wheel

00:05:33.710 --> 00:05:36.070 
run them out along the face of the wheel
you<00:05:33.949> can<00:05:33.979> run<00:05:34.219> one<00:05:34.430> here<00:05:35.000> you<00:05:35.599> can<00:05:35.750> run<00:05:35.900> them

00:05:36.070 --> 00:05:36.080 
you can run one here you can run them

00:05:36.080 --> 00:05:38.950 
you can run one here you can run them
anywhere<00:05:36.529> along<00:05:36.860> the<00:05:37.039> three<00:05:37.370> positions<00:05:38.000> and

00:05:38.950 --> 00:05:38.960 
anywhere along the three positions and

00:05:38.960 --> 00:05:40.659 
anywhere along the three positions and
if<00:05:39.080> you're<00:05:39.229> concerned<00:05:39.620> about<00:05:39.770> visibility<00:05:40.400> you

00:05:40.659 --> 00:05:40.669 
if you're concerned about visibility you

00:05:40.669 --> 00:05:43.749 
if you're concerned about visibility you
can<00:05:40.789> always<00:05:40.940> take<00:05:41.270> some<00:05:41.599> silver<00:05:42.139> paint<00:05:42.860> or

00:05:43.749 --> 00:05:43.759 
can always take some silver paint or

00:05:43.759 --> 00:05:45.189 
can always take some silver paint or
anything<00:05:44.000> like<00:05:44.210> that<00:05:44.449> that'll<00:05:44.779> match<00:05:44.990> the

00:05:45.189 --> 00:05:45.199 
anything like that that'll match the

00:05:45.199 --> 00:05:48.730 
anything like that that'll match the
color<00:05:45.409> of<00:05:45.589> your<00:05:45.680> wheels<00:05:45.979> and<00:05:47.440> paint<00:05:48.440> over<00:05:48.529> it

00:05:48.730 --> 00:05:48.740 
color of your wheels and paint over it

00:05:48.740 --> 00:05:50.969 
color of your wheels and paint over it
and<00:05:48.889> that<00:05:48.949> will<00:05:49.550> essentially<00:05:49.909> camouflage<00:05:50.599> it

00:05:50.969 --> 00:05:50.979 
and that will essentially camouflage it

00:05:50.979 --> 00:05:53.200 
and that will essentially camouflage it
and<00:05:51.979> it'll<00:05:52.159> keep<00:05:52.339> you<00:05:52.490> from<00:05:52.520> Jill<00:05:52.940> in<00:05:53.060> that

00:05:53.200 --> 00:05:53.210 
and it'll keep you from Jill in that

00:05:53.210 --> 00:05:54.670 
and it'll keep you from Jill in that
hole<00:05:53.389> if<00:05:53.659> you're<00:05:53.930> uncomfortable<00:05:54.229> with<00:05:54.620> it

00:05:54.670 --> 00:05:54.680 
hole if you're uncomfortable with it

00:05:54.680 --> 00:05:56.890 
hole if you're uncomfortable with it
again<00:05:55.490> it<00:05:55.729> depends<00:05:56.120> on<00:05:56.210> how<00:05:56.360> much<00:05:56.509> effort<00:05:56.870> you

00:05:56.890 --> 00:05:56.900 
again it depends on how much effort you

00:05:56.900 --> 00:06:00.399 
again it depends on how much effort you
want<00:05:57.110> to<00:05:57.199> go<00:05:57.289> through<00:05:57.650> and<00:05:58.779> and<00:05:59.779> how<00:05:59.990> clean<00:06:00.289> of

00:06:00.399 --> 00:06:00.409 
want to go through and and how clean of

00:06:00.409 --> 00:06:02.619 
want to go through and and how clean of
a<00:06:00.469> look<00:06:00.620> you<00:06:00.770> want<00:06:00.979> now<00:06:01.819> believe<00:06:02.300> it<00:06:02.419> or<00:06:02.539> not

00:06:02.619 --> 00:06:02.629 
a look you want now believe it or not

00:06:02.629 --> 00:06:04.629 
a look you want now believe it or not
putting<00:06:03.379> the<00:06:03.500> lights<00:06:03.710> on<00:06:03.949> and<00:06:04.250> running<00:06:04.550> the

00:06:04.629 --> 00:06:04.639 
putting the lights on and running the

00:06:04.639 --> 00:06:07.059 
putting the lights on and running the
wires<00:06:04.819> that<00:06:05.389> is<00:06:05.629> the<00:06:05.930> hardest<00:06:06.379> part<00:06:06.710> of<00:06:06.889> this

00:06:07.059 --> 00:06:07.069 
wires that is the hardest part of this

00:06:07.069 --> 00:06:08.860 
wires that is the hardest part of this
project<00:06:07.389> so<00:06:08.389> if<00:06:08.479> you've<00:06:08.629> got<00:06:08.810> that

00:06:08.860 --> 00:06:08.870 
project so if you've got that

00:06:08.870 --> 00:06:11.559 
project so if you've got that
accomplished<00:06:09.589> now<00:06:09.800> we'll<00:06:10.729> go<00:06:10.879> down<00:06:11.089> and<00:06:11.120> we'll

00:06:11.559 --> 00:06:11.569 
accomplished now we'll go down and we'll

00:06:11.569 --> 00:06:13.390 
accomplished now we'll go down and we'll
see<00:06:11.810> how<00:06:12.020> to<00:06:12.050> actually<00:06:12.319> mount<00:06:12.680> the<00:06:12.889> power<00:06:13.039> puck

00:06:13.390 --> 00:06:13.400 
see how to actually mount the power puck

00:06:13.400 --> 00:06:16.210 
see how to actually mount the power puck
on<00:06:13.669> the<00:06:14.029> bike
