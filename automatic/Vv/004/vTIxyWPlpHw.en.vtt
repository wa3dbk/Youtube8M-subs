playing some of the big players is
because

00:04:26.810 --> 00:04:26.820 
because

00:04:26.820 --> 00:04:28.220 
because
I<00:04:26.850> think<00:04:27.240> it<00:04:27.390> was<00:04:27.450> that<00:04:27.510> we<00:04:27.660> had<00:04:27.690> a<00:04:27.810> long<00:04:28.020> rest

00:04:28.220 --> 00:04:28.230 
I think it was that we had a long rest

00:04:28.230 --> 00:04:30.500 
I think it was that we had a long rest
after<00:04:28.560> the<00:04:28.590> game<00:04:29.490> against<00:04:29.730> Chelsea<00:04:30.150> till<00:04:30.330> this

00:04:30.500 --> 00:04:30.510 
after the game against Chelsea till this

00:04:30.510 --> 00:04:31.730 
after the game against Chelsea till this
game<00:04:30.750> like<00:04:30.990> there<00:04:31.110> was<00:04:31.200> a<00:04:31.260> lot<00:04:31.410> of<00:04:31.440> time<00:04:31.590> in

00:04:31.730 --> 00:04:31.740 
game like there was a lot of time in

00:04:31.740 --> 00:04:33.380 
game like there was a lot of time in
between<00:04:31.800> and<00:04:32.310> there<00:04:32.940> wasn't<00:04:33.060> really<00:04:33.270> much

00:04:33.380 --> 00:04:33.390 
between and there wasn't really much

00:04:33.390 --> 00:04:35.870 
between and there wasn't really much
after<00:04:33.870> it<00:04:33.960> for<00:04:34.140> it<00:04:34.290> for<00:04:34.860> a<00:04:34.950> bit<00:04:35.040> a<00:04:35.070> bit<00:04:35.490> of<00:04:35.730> time

00:04:35.870 --> 00:04:35.880 
after it for it for a bit a bit of time

00:04:35.880 --> 00:04:37.250 
after it for it for a bit a bit of time
so<00:04:36.060> I<00:04:36.120> was<00:04:36.210> like<00:04:36.300> okay<00:04:36.360> i'll<00:04:36.630> just<00:04:36.810> play<00:04:36.960> strong

00:04:37.250 --> 00:04:37.260 
so I was like okay i'll just play strong

00:04:37.260 --> 00:04:38.900 
so I was like okay i'll just play strong
team<00:04:37.470> then<00:04:37.680> unfortunately<00:04:38.610> though<00:04:38.700> you<00:04:38.790> can

00:04:38.900 --> 00:04:38.910 
team then unfortunately though you can

00:04:38.910 --> 00:04:40.430 
team then unfortunately though you can
see<00:04:39.060> Danny<00:04:39.270> well<00:04:39.480> but<00:04:39.630> there<00:04:39.750> gives<00:04:40.050> away<00:04:40.230> a

00:04:40.430 --> 00:04:40.440 
see Danny well but there gives away a

00:04:40.440 --> 00:04:42.140 
see Danny well but there gives away a
penalty<00:04:40.830> in<00:04:41.130> the<00:04:41.280> 90th<00:04:41.580> minute<00:04:41.640> I'm<00:04:41.910> not<00:04:42.030> sure

00:04:42.140 --> 00:04:42.150 
penalty in the 90th minute I'm not sure

00:04:42.150 --> 00:04:44.000 
penalty in the 90th minute I'm not sure
if<00:04:42.240> this<00:04:42.330> really<00:04:42.510> was<00:04:42.690> a<00:04:42.750> penalty<00:04:43.200> for<00:04:43.830> me<00:04:43.920> it

00:04:44.000 --> 00:04:44.010 
if this really was a penalty for me it

00:04:44.010 --> 00:04:45.650 
if this really was a penalty for me it
was<00:04:44.070> a<00:04:44.160> very<00:04:44.520> very<00:04:44.670> soft<00:04:44.940> fun<00:04:45.150> but<00:04:45.270> to<00:04:45.360> be<00:04:45.420> fair

00:04:45.650 --> 00:04:45.660 
was a very very soft fun but to be fair

00:04:45.660 --> 00:04:47.930 
was a very very soft fun but to be fair
I've<00:04:45.930> had<00:04:46.470> a<00:04:46.500> lot<00:04:46.590> of<00:04:46.650> soft<00:04:46.920> penalties<00:04:47.310> this

00:04:47.930 --> 00:04:47.940 
I've had a lot of soft penalties this

00:04:47.940 --> 00:04:50.960 
I've had a lot of soft penalties this
season<00:04:48.330> so<00:04:48.510> look<00:04:48.690> at<00:04:48.780> this<00:04:49.430> charge<00:04:50.430> to<00:04:50.580> shoot<00:04:50.790> I

00:04:50.960 --> 00:04:50.970 
season so look at this charge to shoot I

00:04:50.970 --> 00:04:52.130 
season so look at this charge to shoot I
didn't<00:04:51.240> even<00:04:51.330> get<00:04:51.540> I<00:04:51.570> wasn't<00:04:51.810> controlling

00:04:52.130 --> 00:04:52.140 
didn't even get I wasn't controlling

00:04:52.140 --> 00:04:53.600 
didn't even get I wasn't controlling
Danny<00:04:52.350> Welbeck<00:04:52.680> at<00:04:52.800> the<00:04:52.890> time<00:04:53.070> I<00:04:53.100> don't<00:04:53.340> think

00:04:53.600 --> 00:04:53.610 
Danny Welbeck at the time I don't think

00:04:53.610 --> 00:04:57.260 
Danny Welbeck at the time I don't think
and<00:04:54.830> it<00:04:55.830> like<00:04:56.160> you<00:04:56.280> just<00:04:56.310> clipped<00:04:56.760> his<00:04:56.970> foot

00:04:57.260 --> 00:04:57.270 
and it like you just clipped his foot

00:04:57.270 --> 00:04:59.960 
and it like you just clipped his foot
against<00:04:57.540> dangle<00:04:58.500> books<00:04:58.680> leg<00:04:58.920> and<00:04:59.460> apparently

00:04:59.960 --> 00:04:59.970 
against dangle books leg and apparently

00:04:59.970 --> 00:05:02.270 
against dangle books leg and apparently
that's<00:05:00.150> a<00:05:00.270> penalty<00:05:00.480> I<00:05:00.690> don't<00:05:01.170> know<00:05:01.260> how<00:05:01.410> so

00:05:02.270 --> 00:05:02.280 
that's a penalty I don't know how so

00:05:02.280 --> 00:05:03.680 
that's a penalty I don't know how so
let's<00:05:02.640> have<00:05:02.730> a<00:05:02.820> look<00:05:02.940> at<00:05:03.060> this<00:05:03.210> let's<00:05:03.270> see<00:05:03.570> what

00:05:03.680 --> 00:05:03.690 
let's have a look at this let's see what

00:05:03.690 --> 00:05:05.780 
let's have a look at this let's see what
happens<00:05:03.990> here<00:05:04.080> but<00:05:04.620> just<00:05:04.860> this<00:05:05.010> maybe<00:05:05.310> can<00:05:05.760> we

00:05:05.780 --> 00:05:05.790 
happens here but just this maybe can we

00:05:05.790 --> 00:05:08.420 
happens here but just this maybe can we
save<00:05:06.120> it<00:05:06.300> can<00:05:06.450> we<00:05:06.570> save<00:05:06.780> it<00:05:06.960> I<00:05:07.290> like<00:05:08.190> half<00:05:08.400> of

00:05:08.420 --> 00:05:08.430 
save it can we save it I like half of

00:05:08.430 --> 00:05:10.580 
save it can we save it I like half of
the<00:05:08.880> match<00:05:09.000> off<00:05:09.270> he<00:05:09.660> hits<00:05:09.930> the<00:05:10.050> post<00:05:10.290> i<00:05:10.440> went

00:05:10.580 --> 00:05:10.590 
the match off he hits the post i went

00:05:10.590 --> 00:05:13.580 
the match off he hits the post i went
the<00:05:10.650> wrong<00:05:10.770> way<00:05:10.830> he<00:05:11.610> shoes<00:05:12.030> and<00:05:12.510> i<00:05:13.140> think<00:05:13.470> it

00:05:13.580 --> 00:05:13.590 
the wrong way he shoes and i think it

00:05:13.590 --> 00:05:16.190 
the wrong way he shoes and i think it
hit<00:05:13.950> the<00:05:14.010> player<00:05:14.490> he<00:05:14.640> took<00:05:14.880> the<00:05:15.120> penalty<00:05:15.570> so<00:05:16.140> it

00:05:16.190 --> 00:05:16.200 
hit the player he took the penalty so it

00:05:16.200 --> 00:05:19.580 
hit the player he took the penalty so it
was<00:05:16.290> offside<00:05:16.680> so<00:05:16.980> I<00:05:17.070> was<00:05:17.220> loving<00:05:17.490> that<00:05:18.560> but<00:05:19.560> I

00:05:19.580 --> 00:05:19.590 
was offside so I was loving that but I

00:05:19.590 --> 00:05:21.380 
was offside so I was loving that but I
think<00:05:19.830> it's<00:05:20.070> what<00:05:20.220> happens<00:05:20.610> next<00:05:20.880> which<00:05:21.180> is<00:05:21.360> a

00:05:21.380 --> 00:05:21.390 
think it's what happens next which is a

00:05:21.390 --> 00:05:22.580 
think it's what happens next which is a
little<00:05:21.570> bit<00:05:21.660> more<00:05:21.780> interesting<00:05:22.200> for<00:05:22.320> you<00:05:22.440> guys

00:05:22.580 --> 00:05:22.590 
little bit more interesting for you guys

00:05:22.590 --> 00:05:25.130 
little bit more interesting for you guys
so<00:05:22.950> passing<00:05:23.850> out<00:05:24.030> is<00:05:24.240> with<00:05:24.360> David<00:05:24.660> silver<00:05:25.080> you

00:05:25.130 --> 00:05:25.140 
so passing out is with David silver you

00:05:25.140 --> 00:05:27.020 
so passing out is with David silver you
can<00:05:25.200> see<00:05:25.380> he's<00:05:25.470> not<00:05:25.620> got<00:05:25.770> much<00:05:25.800> energy<00:05:26.220> left<00:05:26.430> he

00:05:27.020 --> 00:05:27.030 
can see he's not got much energy left he

00:05:27.030 --> 00:05:28.640 
can see he's not got much energy left he
feeds<00:05:27.270> it<00:05:27.360> through<00:05:27.540> to<00:05:27.660> Gareth<00:05:27.870> Bale<00:05:28.080> Gareth

00:05:28.640 --> 00:05:28.650 
feeds it through to Gareth Bale Gareth

00:05:28.650 --> 00:05:30.850 
feeds it through to Gareth Bale Gareth
Bale<00:05:28.890> running<00:05:29.370> away<00:05:29.640> from<00:05:29.700> them<00:05:30.090> with<00:05:30.240> it<00:05:30.420> and

00:05:30.850 --> 00:05:30.860 
Bale running away from them with it and

00:05:30.860 --> 00:05:33.080 
Bale running away from them with it and
slams<00:05:31.860> it<00:05:32.070> into<00:05:32.190> the<00:05:32.370> back<00:05:32.490> of<00:05:32.550> the<00:05:32.790> net<00:05:32.940> to

00:05:33.080 --> 00:05:33.090 
slams it into the back of the net to

00:05:33.090 --> 00:05:35.480 
slams it into the back of the net to
make<00:05:33.210> it<00:05:33.360> three<00:05:33.630> nil<00:05:33.870> I<00:05:34.320> was<00:05:34.680> so<00:05:34.950> pleased<00:05:35.310> the

00:05:35.480 --> 00:05:35.490 
make it three nil I was so pleased the

00:05:35.490 --> 00:05:37.490 
make it three nil I was so pleased the
fact<00:05:35.730> that<00:05:35.790> they<00:05:36.030> would<00:05:36.690> have<00:05:36.870> scored<00:05:37.200> but<00:05:37.350> it

00:05:37.490 --> 00:05:37.500 
fact that they would have scored but it

00:05:37.500 --> 00:05:39.530 
fact that they would have scored but it
went<00:05:37.650> outside<00:05:37.680> and<00:05:38.070> then<00:05:38.670> we<00:05:39.360> come<00:05:39.510> back

00:05:39.530 --> 00:05:39.540 
went outside and then we come back

00:05:39.540 --> 00:05:41.180 
went outside and then we come back
unfortunately<00:05:40.440> the<00:05:40.530> big<00:05:40.680> thing<00:05:40.860> about<00:05:40.950> that

00:05:41.180 --> 00:05:41.190 
unfortunately the big thing about that

00:05:41.190 --> 00:05:43.070 
unfortunately the big thing about that
Gareth<00:05:41.520> Bale<00:05:41.700> got<00:05:41.880> injured<00:05:42.240> it<00:05:42.450> was<00:05:42.600> turns<00:05:42.930> out

00:05:43.070 --> 00:05:43.080 
Gareth Bale got injured it was turns out

00:05:43.080 --> 00:05:45.110 
Gareth Bale got injured it was turns out
it<00:05:43.260> was<00:05:43.410> like<00:05:43.620> a<00:05:43.650> little<00:05:43.830> injury<00:05:44.220> like<00:05:44.370> it

00:05:45.110 --> 00:05:45.120 
it was like a little injury like it

00:05:45.120 --> 00:05:46.730 
it was like a little injury like it
didn't<00:05:45.360> say<00:05:45.480> was<00:05:45.630> injured<00:05:45.870> after<00:05:45.990> the<00:05:46.170> game<00:05:46.380> so

00:05:46.730 --> 00:05:46.740 
didn't say was injured after the game so

00:05:46.740 --> 00:05:49.040 
didn't say was injured after the game so
I'm<00:05:47.340> assuming<00:05:47.610> it<00:05:48.030> wasn't<00:05:48.180> really<00:05:48.660> that<00:05:48.750> bad<00:05:48.990> i

00:05:49.040 --> 00:05:49.050 
I'm assuming it wasn't really that bad i

00:05:49.050 --> 00:05:50.300 
I'm assuming it wasn't really that bad i
just<00:05:49.290> want<00:05:49.440> to<00:05:49.470> show<00:05:49.710> you<00:05:49.770> some<00:05:50.010> of<00:05:50.040> the<00:05:50.160> guys
