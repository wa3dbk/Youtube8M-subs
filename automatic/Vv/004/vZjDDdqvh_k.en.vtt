00:00:08.310 --> 00:00:13.320
 the galata the sea museum the major 

00:00:11.190 --> 00:00:15.420
 Italian maritime museum is located in 

00:00:13.320 --> 00:00:18.270
 genoa in the city â€‹â€‹of christopher colombo 

00:00:15.420 --> 00:00:21.210
 and was born in 2004 

00:00:18.270 --> 00:00:24.330
 so either a fairly recent museum for 

00:00:21.210 --> 00:00:27.419
 it was important to do this 

00:00:24.330 --> 00:00:30.300
 museum and above all to evolve a 

00:00:27.419 --> 00:00:33.170
 concept of different museology 

00:00:30.300 --> 00:00:35.520
 the museum is the place where they are made 

00:00:33.170 --> 00:00:38.150
 experiences within this 

00:00:35.520 --> 00:00:40.850
 experience was extremely 

00:00:38.150 --> 00:00:44.130
 important to make use of new technologies 

00:00:40.850 --> 00:00:46.650
 new technologies especially for the 

00:00:44.130 --> 00:00:48.330
 image reconstruction reasons 

00:00:46.650 --> 00:00:50.940
 main ones that led us to 

00:00:48.330 --> 00:00:53.910
 choose samsung technologies 

00:00:50.940 --> 00:00:56.670
 in particular I would like to say the first two 

00:00:53.910 --> 00:00:58.950
 is the quality and visual quality that 

00:00:56.670 --> 00:01:00.960
 it also becomes decisive 

00:00:58.950 --> 00:01:03.390
 in the visitor's experience 

00:01:00.960 --> 00:01:05.820
 the second is the robustness e 

00:01:03.390 --> 00:01:08.220
 reliability precisely because a museum 

00:01:05.820 --> 00:01:10.830
 like ours which also has more than 2 

00:01:08.220 --> 00:01:13.679
 thousand visitors per day in certain 

00:01:10.830 --> 00:01:15.859
 moments to the need to be able to 

00:01:13.679 --> 00:01:18.200
 make use of tools that are 

00:01:15.859 --> 00:01:20.729
 sufficiently robust and reliable 

00:01:18.200 --> 00:01:23.490
 also work in conditions 

00:01:20.729 --> 00:01:26.130
 we say of more stressful use and da 

00:01:23.490 --> 00:01:29.780
 this point of view the samsung partner 

00:01:26.130 --> 00:01:29.780
 which turned out to be very reliable 

00:01:32.020 --> 00:01:37.420
 well for me this museum is wonderful 

00:01:34.689 --> 00:01:40.149
 I really I find it really 

00:01:37.420 --> 00:01:42.729
 it was an experience for me that is for 

00:01:40.149 --> 00:01:45.429
 example these are these screens 

00:01:42.729 --> 00:01:47.679
 with these images it really looks like 

00:01:45.429 --> 00:01:52.689
 being able to talk to these characters with 

00:01:47.679 --> 00:01:55.869
 these emigrants and then I could touch 

00:01:52.689 --> 00:01:58.179
 with touchscreen it's really light 

00:01:55.869 --> 00:02:02.500
 these letters are these stories to me 

00:01:58.179 --> 00:02:06.220
 really excited a lot and both 

00:02:02.500 --> 00:02:10.619
 really a great experience 

00:02:06.220 --> 00:02:10.619
 I would really recommend everyone 

00:02:13.440 --> 00:02:19.770
 that tt is a software company and 

00:02:16.160 --> 00:02:21.270
 careful system integrator in scouting 

00:02:19.770 --> 00:02:23.460
 of technological innovation 

00:02:21.270 --> 00:02:26.340
 we found a samsung right on 

00:02:23.460 --> 00:02:27.810
 ideal partner because it allows 

00:02:26.340 --> 00:02:30.000
 insertion inside 

00:02:27.810 --> 00:02:32.280
 of the preparation of key devices in 

00:02:30.000 --> 00:02:34.890
 hand this guarantees us speed and 

00:02:32.280 --> 00:02:36.840
 security in the final phase that is 

00:02:34.890 --> 00:02:38.580
 the more delicate the choice of samsung 

00:02:36.840 --> 00:02:40.710
 3 tt is a winning choice and it is 

00:02:38.580 --> 00:02:43.070
 confirms and proves the museum galata 

00:02:40.710 --> 00:02:43.070
 of the sea 

00:02:49.420 --> 00:02:55.420
 I would say that the level of satisfaction 

00:02:52.330 --> 00:02:58.840
 for this choice and for this 

00:02:55.420 --> 00:03:01.630
 partnership is very high partner 

00:02:58.840 --> 00:03:05.260
 chosen turned out to be up to the 

00:03:01.630 --> 00:03:08.140
 our performances and I really hope that 

00:03:05.260 --> 00:03:10.989
 even in the near future new products 

00:03:08.140 --> 00:03:14.500
 technological can help us say 

00:03:10.989 --> 00:03:18.840
 thus to offer additional quality in more 

00:03:14.500 --> 00:03:22.630
 especially to replace another type of 

00:03:18.840 --> 00:03:25.000
 we can say of technologies as for 

00:03:22.630 --> 00:03:27.549
 example the video projection that is 

00:03:25.000 --> 00:03:30.160
 clearly they reveal themselves much more 

00:03:27.549 --> 00:03:33.489
 waste much less reliable much 

00:03:30.160 --> 00:03:38.040
 less durable than those that are 

00:03:33.489 --> 00:03:38.040
 refer instead to the samsung displays
