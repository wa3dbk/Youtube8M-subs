00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.519 

I

00:00:04.519 --> 00:00:04.529 

00:00:04.529 --> 00:00:11.090 

so<00:00:05.529> this<00:00:05.799> is<00:00:05.890> basically<00:00:07.500> ready<00:00:08.500> to<00:00:08.770> wire<00:00:08.980> up

00:00:11.090 --> 00:00:11.100 
so this is basically ready to wire up

00:00:11.100 --> 00:00:13.260 
so this is basically ready to wire up
firing<00:00:12.100> it<00:00:12.219> up<00:00:12.280> is<00:00:12.430> probably<00:00:12.789> actually<00:00:13.000> the

00:00:13.260 --> 00:00:13.270 
firing it up is probably actually the

00:00:13.270 --> 00:00:18.210 
firing it up is probably actually the
easiest<00:00:13.629> part<00:00:13.959> of<00:00:14.670> all<00:00:15.670> of<00:00:15.699> this<00:00:17.220> basically

00:00:18.210 --> 00:00:18.220 
easiest part of all of this basically

00:00:18.220 --> 00:00:27.989 
easiest part of all of this basically
every<00:00:18.760> Ranger<00:00:19.720> needs<00:00:19.960> and<00:00:20.260> not<00:00:20.919> equal<00:00:26.999> since

00:00:27.989 --> 00:00:27.999 
every Ranger needs and not equal since

00:00:27.999 --> 00:00:31.850 
every Ranger needs and not equal since
for<00:00:28.300> naught<00:00:28.509> equals<00:00:28.869> and<00:00:29.669> every<00:00:30.669> Ranger<00:00:31.210> needs

00:00:31.850 --> 00:00:31.860 
for naught equals and every Ranger needs

00:00:31.860 --> 00:00:43.590 
for naught equals and every Ranger needs
multiplied<00:00:41.670> now<00:00:42.670> basically<00:00:42.940> if<00:00:43.239> you<00:00:43.359> can't

00:00:43.590 --> 00:00:43.600 
multiplied now basically if you can't

00:00:43.600 --> 00:00:46.619 
multiplied now basically if you can't
wire<00:00:44.199> you<00:00:44.620> can<00:00:44.649> find<00:00:45.010> making<00:00:45.699> engines<00:00:46.090> very

00:00:46.619 --> 00:00:46.629 
wire you can find making engines very

00:00:46.629 --> 00:00:52.610 
wire you can find making engines very
very<00:00:46.989> difficult<00:00:48.210> so<00:00:49.210> we'll<00:00:49.420> just<00:00:49.449> stop<00:00:49.890> this

00:00:52.610 --> 00:00:52.620 
very difficult so we'll just stop this

00:00:52.620 --> 00:00:54.990 
very difficult so we'll just stop this
now<00:00:53.620> another<00:00:53.859> way<00:00:53.949> to<00:00:54.100> just<00:00:54.309> make<00:00:54.460> life<00:00:54.640> easier

00:00:54.990 --> 00:00:55.000 
now another way to just make life easier

00:00:55.000 --> 00:00:58.259 
now another way to just make life easier
is<00:00:55.260> color<00:00:56.260> coding<00:00:56.589> the<00:00:56.679> chips<00:00:56.980> to<00:00:57.789> the<00:00:57.820> Ranger

00:00:58.259 --> 00:00:58.269 
is color coding the chips to the Ranger

00:00:58.269 --> 00:01:00.509 
is color coding the chips to the Ranger
so<00:00:58.480> this<00:00:58.629> top<00:00:58.809> Ranger<00:00:59.199> is<00:00:59.379> blue<00:01:00.039> doesn't

00:01:00.509 --> 00:01:00.519 
so this top Ranger is blue doesn't

00:01:00.519 --> 00:01:04.770 
so this top Ranger is blue doesn't
matter<00:01:00.609> what<00:01:00.820> it<00:01:00.910> is<00:01:01.679> just<00:01:02.999> get<00:01:03.999> allocate<00:01:04.570> a

00:01:04.770 --> 00:01:04.780 
matter what it is just get allocate a

00:01:04.780 --> 00:01:11.160 
matter what it is just get allocate a
set<00:01:05.410> of<00:01:05.500> chips<00:01:05.800> to<00:01:06.070> each<00:01:06.190> Ranger<00:01:07.050> next<00:01:08.050> is<00:01:10.170> need

00:01:11.160 --> 00:01:11.170 
set of chips to each Ranger next is need

00:01:11.170 --> 00:01:16.179 
set of chips to each Ranger next is need
one<00:01:11.380> for<00:01:11.560> yellow

00:01:16.179 --> 00:01:16.189 

00:01:16.189 --> 00:01:27.080 

14<00:01:17.189> grain<00:01:18.350> and<00:01:19.350> the<00:01:19.439> 14<00:01:19.619> red<00:01:25.220> now<00:01:26.220> if<00:01:26.490> this<00:01:26.880> is

00:01:27.080 --> 00:01:27.090 
14 grain and the 14 red now if this is

00:01:27.090 --> 00:01:29.120 
14 grain and the 14 red now if this is
assuming<00:01:27.330> you<00:01:27.600> actually<00:01:27.869> want<00:01:28.110> to<00:01:28.619> be<00:01:28.799> able<00:01:28.920> to

00:01:29.120 --> 00:01:29.130 
assuming you actually want to be able to

00:01:29.130 --> 00:01:33.109 
assuming you actually want to be able to
control<00:01:29.460> the<00:01:29.939> throttle<00:01:31.280> you<00:01:32.280> can<00:01:32.460> use<00:01:32.700> an

00:01:33.109 --> 00:01:33.119 
control the throttle you can use an

00:01:33.119 --> 00:01:34.789 
control the throttle you can use an
increment<00:01:33.360> decrement<00:01:33.840> i'm<00:01:34.020> sure<00:01:34.259> those<00:01:34.500> other

00:01:34.789 --> 00:01:34.799 
increment decrement i'm sure those other

00:01:34.799 --> 00:01:36.620 
increment decrement i'm sure those other
methods<00:01:35.220> but<00:01:35.429> this<00:01:35.640> is<00:01:35.820> just<00:01:35.850> the<00:01:36.119> way<00:01:36.210> i<00:01:36.240> do<00:01:36.360> it

00:01:36.620 --> 00:01:36.630 
methods but this is just the way i do it

00:01:36.630 --> 00:01:41.719 
methods but this is just the way i do it
and<00:01:37.970> increment<00:01:38.970> decrement<00:01:39.330> is<00:01:40.009> basically<00:01:41.009> the

00:01:41.719 --> 00:01:41.729 
and increment decrement is basically the

00:01:41.729 --> 00:01:43.039 
and increment decrement is basically the
amount<00:01:41.939> of<00:01:42.030> force<00:01:42.360> that<00:01:42.509> you're<00:01:42.810> going<00:01:42.990> to

00:01:43.039 --> 00:01:43.049 
amount of force that you're going to

00:01:43.049 --> 00:01:45.410 
amount of force that you're going to
apply<00:01:43.380> to<00:01:43.530> the<00:01:43.830> forces<00:01:44.159> I<00:01:44.460> mean<00:01:44.759> sorry<00:01:45.210> the

00:01:45.410 --> 00:01:45.420 
apply to the forces I mean sorry the

00:01:45.420 --> 00:01:49.669 
apply to the forces I mean sorry the
thrusters<00:01:46.970> so<00:01:48.170> you<00:01:49.170> kind<00:01:49.380> of<00:01:49.409> stand<00:01:49.560> are

00:01:49.669 --> 00:01:49.679 
thrusters so you kind of stand are

00:01:49.679 --> 00:01:53.710 
thrusters so you kind of stand are
multiplied<00:01:50.039> works<00:01:50.250> if<00:01:50.929> this<00:01:51.929> not<00:01:52.259> equal<00:01:52.709> is

00:01:53.710 --> 00:01:53.720 
multiplied works if this not equal is

00:01:53.720 --> 00:01:57.109 
multiplied works if this not equal is
triggered<00:01:54.720> it'll<00:01:55.080> be<00:01:55.380> a<00:01:55.409> value<00:01:55.740> of<00:01:55.770> one<00:01:55.909> at<00:01:56.909> one

00:01:57.109 --> 00:01:57.119 
triggered it'll be a value of one at one

00:01:57.119 --> 00:01:59.930 
triggered it'll be a value of one at one
times<00:01:58.039> whatever<00:01:59.039> this<00:01:59.220> increment<00:01:59.490> decrement

00:01:59.930 --> 00:01:59.940 
times whatever this increment decrement

00:01:59.940 --> 00:02:02.870 
times whatever this increment decrement
is<00:02:00.240> is<00:02:00.569> just<00:02:00.869> an<00:02:01.350> output<00:02:01.799> but<00:02:02.459> whatever<00:02:02.759> this

00:02:02.870 --> 00:02:02.880 
is is just an output but whatever this

00:02:02.880 --> 00:02:04.639 
is is just an output but whatever this
is<00:02:02.940> you<00:02:03.179> could<00:02:03.270> have<00:02:03.390> this<00:02:03.539> is<00:02:03.780> millions

00:02:04.639 --> 00:02:04.649 
is you could have this is millions

00:02:04.649 --> 00:02:07.370 
is you could have this is millions
millions<00:02:05.039> but<00:02:05.250> if<00:02:06.060> this<00:02:06.240> not<00:02:06.479> equal<00:02:06.899> isn't

00:02:07.370 --> 00:02:07.380 
millions but if this not equal isn't

00:02:07.380 --> 00:02:08.870 
millions but if this not equal isn't
being<00:02:07.560> triggered<00:02:07.860> it's<00:02:08.429> just<00:02:08.610> going<00:02:08.789> to<00:02:08.819> be

00:02:08.870 --> 00:02:08.880 
being triggered it's just going to be

00:02:08.880 --> 00:02:12.140 
being triggered it's just going to be
whatever<00:02:09.209> this<00:02:09.479> increment<00:02:09.780> decrement<00:02:10.229> is<00:02:10.700> x<00:02:11.700> 0

00:02:12.140 --> 00:02:12.150 
whatever this increment decrement is x 0

00:02:12.150 --> 00:02:19.250 
whatever this increment decrement is x 0
which<00:02:12.360> is<00:02:12.540> just<00:02:12.810> 0<00:02:16.790> so<00:02:17.790> we'll<00:02:18.030> just<00:02:18.060> wire<00:02:18.450> a<00:02:18.720> on

00:02:19.250 --> 00:02:19.260 
which is just 0 so we'll just wire a on

00:02:19.260 --> 00:02:26.349 
which is just 0 so we'll just wire a on
the<00:02:19.530> not<00:02:19.650> equals<00:02:19.980> to<00:02:20.790> the<00:02:21.420> color-coded<00:02:22.140> ranger

00:02:26.349 --> 00:02:26.359 

00:02:26.359 --> 00:02:33.020 

just<00:02:27.359> straight<00:02:27.720> under<00:02:27.989> distance<00:02:30.650> and<00:02:31.670> then<00:02:32.670> a

00:02:33.020 --> 00:02:33.030 
just straight under distance and then a

00:02:33.030 --> 00:02:38.720 
just straight under distance and then a
and<00:02:33.239> the<00:02:33.540> multipliers<00:02:33.989> is<00:02:34.410> the<00:02:37.609> not<00:02:38.609> equal

00:02:38.720 --> 00:02:38.730 
and the multipliers is the not equal

00:02:38.730 --> 00:02:43.310 
and the multipliers is the not equal
below<00:02:39.209> it<00:02:39.359> and<00:02:40.760> B<00:02:41.760> is<00:02:42.090> the<00:02:42.900> increment

00:02:43.310 --> 00:02:43.320 
below it and B is the increment

00:02:43.320 --> 00:02:48.559 
below it and B is the increment
decrement

00:02:48.559 --> 00:02:48.569 

00:02:48.569 --> 00:02:57.789 

now<00:02:50.810> you're<00:02:51.810> going<00:02:51.930> to<00:02:52.019> need<00:02:53.900> for<00:02:54.900> now<00:02:55.019> just<00:02:55.530> a

00:02:57.789 --> 00:02:57.799 
now you're going to need for now just a

00:02:57.799 --> 00:03:00.410 
now you're going to need for now just a
number<00:02:58.799> that<00:02:59.340> the<00:02:59.609> increment<00:02:59.909> decrement<00:03:00.209> will

00:03:00.410 --> 00:03:00.420 
number that the increment decrement will

00:03:00.420 --> 00:03:04.220 
number that the increment decrement will
increase<00:03:00.900> and<00:03:01.200> decrease<00:03:01.560> by<00:03:02.840> just<00:03:03.840> a<00:03:03.930> constant

00:03:04.220 --> 00:03:04.230 
increase and decrease by just a constant

00:03:04.230 --> 00:03:09.559 
increase and decrease by just a constant
value<00:03:06.019> you<00:03:07.019> place<00:03:07.200> this<00:03:07.439> as<00:03:07.739> a<00:03:08.329> you<00:03:09.329> can<00:03:09.480> have

00:03:09.559 --> 00:03:09.569 
value you place this as a you can have

00:03:09.569 --> 00:03:15.020 
value you place this as a you can have
buttons<00:03:10.019> or<00:03:12.170> a<00:03:13.170> pod<00:03:13.889> controller<00:03:14.340> it<00:03:14.790> doesn't

00:03:15.020 --> 00:03:15.030 
buttons or a pod controller it doesn't

00:03:15.030 --> 00:03:16.670 
buttons or a pod controller it doesn't
really<00:03:15.090> matter<00:03:15.329> as<00:03:15.750> long<00:03:15.810> as<00:03:16.079> you<00:03:16.169> have<00:03:16.349> an

00:03:16.670 --> 00:03:16.680 
really matter as long as you have an

00:03:16.680 --> 00:03:21.770 
really matter as long as you have an
input<00:03:19.219> that<00:03:20.219> you<00:03:20.430> can<00:03:20.700> just<00:03:21.180> control<00:03:21.659> the

00:03:21.770 --> 00:03:21.780 
input that you can just control the

00:03:26.990 --> 00:03:27.000 
increment and the deeper n bye I'm

00:03:27.000 --> 00:03:28.250 
increment and the deeper n bye I'm
just<00:03:27.209> going<00:03:27.329> to<00:03:27.359> use<00:03:27.480> buttons<00:03:27.840> just<00:03:28.139> to

00:03:28.250 --> 00:03:28.260 
just going to use buttons just to

00:03:28.260 --> 00:03:34.039 
just going to use buttons just to
simplify<00:03:28.560> it<00:03:30.709> turn<00:03:31.709> off<00:03:31.859> total<00:03:32.280> I<00:03:32.400> was<00:03:33.049> should

00:03:34.039 --> 00:03:34.049 
simplify it turn off total I was should

00:03:34.049 --> 00:03:39.289 
simplify it turn off total I was should
have<00:03:34.139> hit<00:03:34.260> a<00:03:34.290> fan<00:03:36.889> that's<00:03:37.889> about<00:03:38.069> it<00:03:38.129> I<00:03:38.459> think

00:03:39.289 --> 00:03:39.299 
have hit a fan that's about it I think

00:03:39.299 --> 00:03:43.970 
have hit a fan that's about it I think
it's<00:03:39.419> just<00:03:39.449> ready<00:03:39.719> to<00:03:39.870> wire<00:03:40.079> up<00:03:40.109> now<00:03:41.120> so<00:03:42.980> the

00:03:43.970 --> 00:03:43.980 
it's just ready to wire up now so the

00:03:43.980 --> 00:03:46.610 
it's just ready to wire up now so the
increment<00:03:44.400> is<00:03:44.609> just<00:03:45.090> the<00:03:45.239> opposite<00:03:45.620> obvious

00:03:46.610 --> 00:03:46.620 
increment is just the opposite obvious

00:03:46.620 --> 00:03:48.649 
increment is just the opposite obvious
just<00:03:47.579> what<00:03:47.790> every<00:03:47.819> button<00:03:48.120> you<00:03:48.299> want<00:03:48.480> to

00:03:48.649 --> 00:03:48.659 
just what every button you want to

00:03:48.659 --> 00:03:52.729 
just what every button you want to
increase<00:03:49.079> the<00:03:49.469> throttle<00:03:51.019> decrement<00:03:52.019> is<00:03:52.199> just

00:03:52.729 --> 00:03:52.739 
increase the throttle decrement is just

00:03:52.739 --> 00:03:55.309 
increase the throttle decrement is just
a<00:03:52.949> lot<00:03:53.280> of<00:03:53.400> input<00:03:53.609> you<00:03:53.849> need<00:03:54.000> to<00:03:54.299> decrease<00:03:55.259> the

00:03:55.309 --> 00:03:55.319 
a lot of input you need to decrease the

00:03:55.319 --> 00:03:58.670 
a lot of input you need to decrease the
throttle<00:03:56.180> if<00:03:57.180> you<00:03:57.359> want<00:03:57.569> you<00:03:57.900> can<00:03:57.989> have<00:03:58.049> a

00:03:58.670 --> 00:03:58.680 
throttle if you want you can have a

00:03:58.680 --> 00:04:07.689 
throttle if you want you can have a
reset<00:03:59.340> button<00:04:03.259> just<00:04:04.259> if<00:04:04.409> you<00:04:04.560> go<00:04:04.709> way<00:04:05.159> past<00:04:05.569> the

00:04:07.689 --> 00:04:07.699 
reset button just if you go way past the

00:04:07.699 --> 00:04:10.159 
reset button just if you go way past the
limit<00:04:08.699> of<00:04:08.759> the<00:04:08.879> engine<00:04:09.209> and<00:04:09.449> there's<00:04:09.840> no<00:04:09.930> time

00:04:10.159 --> 00:04:10.169 
limit of the engine and there's no time

00:04:10.169 --> 00:04:18.210 
limit of the engine and there's no time
to<00:04:10.199> go<00:04:10.489> slowly<00:04:11.489> downwards

00:04:18.210 --> 00:04:18.220 

00:04:18.220 --> 00:04:20.469 

let's<00:04:19.220> get<00:04:19.340> a<00:04:19.370> screen<00:04:19.760> just<00:04:19.940> to<00:04:20.030> check<00:04:20.209> if<00:04:20.359> this

00:04:20.469 --> 00:04:20.479 
let's get a screen just to check if this

00:04:20.479 --> 00:04:24.939 
let's get a screen just to check if this
is<00:04:20.630> working<00:04:21.100> in<00:04:22.100> just<00:04:22.430> a<00:04:22.550> display<00:04:23.710> so<00:04:24.710> why<00:04:24.889> this

00:04:24.939 --> 00:04:24.949 
is working in just a display so why this

00:04:24.949 --> 00:04:26.920 
is working in just a display so why this
screen<00:04:25.669> directly<00:04:26.090> to<00:04:26.389> the<00:04:26.510> increment

00:04:26.920 --> 00:04:26.930 
screen directly to the increment

00:04:26.930 --> 00:04:31.150 
screen directly to the increment
decrement<00:04:27.260> if<00:04:28.250> we<00:04:28.400> press<00:04:28.729> these<00:04:28.940> buttons<00:04:30.160> this

00:04:31.150 --> 00:04:31.160 
decrement if we press these buttons this

00:04:31.160 --> 00:04:37.060 
decrement if we press these buttons this
should<00:04:31.490> increase<00:04:33.040> each<00:04:34.040> time<00:04:34.430> +<00:04:34.900> reset<00:04:36.070> should

00:04:37.060 --> 00:04:37.070 
should increase each time + reset should

00:04:37.070 --> 00:04:44.650 
should increase each time + reset should
work<00:04:40.900> now<00:04:42.280> the<00:04:43.280> thrust<00:04:43.580> is<00:04:43.760> just<00:04:44.210> get<00:04:44.389> fired

00:04:44.650 --> 00:04:44.660 
work now the thrust is just get fired

00:04:44.660 --> 00:04:48.540 
work now the thrust is just get fired
directly<00:04:45.110> to<00:04:45.850> the<00:04:46.850> multiplier<00:04:47.360> that's

00:04:48.540 --> 00:04:48.550 
directly to the multiplier that's

00:04:48.550 --> 00:04:53.080 
directly to the multiplier that's
color-coded<00:04:49.550> for<00:04:49.789> it<00:04:51.580> so<00:04:52.580> just<00:04:52.610> go<00:04:52.789> ahead<00:04:52.910> and

00:04:53.080 --> 00:04:53.090 
color-coded for it so just go ahead and

00:04:53.090 --> 00:05:05.879 
color-coded for it so just go ahead and
do<00:04:53.240> this<00:04:54.400> it's<00:04:55.400> pretty<00:04:55.550> simple

00:05:05.879 --> 00:05:05.889 

00:05:05.889 --> 00:05:08.159 

now<00:05:06.460> these<00:05:06.580> engines<00:05:07.090> you're<00:05:07.689> going<00:05:07.810> to<00:05:07.870> run<00:05:08.020> it

00:05:08.159 --> 00:05:08.169 
now these engines you're going to run it

00:05:08.169 --> 00:05:09.390 
now these engines you're going to run it
right<00:05:08.499> now<00:05:08.740> and<00:05:08.860> you're<00:05:08.949> going<00:05:09.069> to<00:05:09.129> think<00:05:09.280> oh

00:05:09.390 --> 00:05:09.400 
right now and you're going to think oh

00:05:09.400 --> 00:05:12.330 
right now and you're going to think oh
that's<00:05:10.199> but<00:05:11.199> actually<00:05:11.409> these<00:05:11.919> engines

00:05:12.330 --> 00:05:12.340 
that's but actually these engines

00:05:12.340 --> 00:05:14.159 
that's but actually these engines
need<00:05:12.520> load<00:05:12.849> just<00:05:13.330> to<00:05:13.419> hold<00:05:13.569> the<00:05:13.749> momentum<00:05:14.080> of

00:05:14.159 --> 00:05:14.169 
need load just to hold the momentum of

00:05:14.169 --> 00:05:16.379 
need load just to hold the momentum of
the<00:05:14.289> crankshaft<00:05:14.550> you<00:05:15.550> could<00:05:15.669> probably<00:05:16.090> make

00:05:16.379 --> 00:05:16.389 
the crankshaft you could probably make

00:05:16.389 --> 00:05:20.909 
the crankshaft you could probably make
the<00:05:16.539> crankshaft<00:05:17.139> way<00:05:17.379> more<00:05:17.650> but<00:05:19.680> it's<00:05:20.680> all<00:05:20.830> up

00:05:20.909 --> 00:05:20.919 
the crankshaft way more but it's all up

00:05:20.919 --> 00:05:33.209 
the crankshaft way more but it's all up
to<00:05:21.039> you<00:05:23.879> nearly<00:05:24.879> done<00:05:30.240> so<00:05:31.240> all<00:05:32.199> these<00:05:32.409> pistons

00:05:33.209 --> 00:05:33.219 
to you nearly done so all these pistons

00:05:33.219 --> 00:05:41.999 
to you nearly done so all these pistons
are<00:05:38.009> why<00:05:39.009> up<00:05:39.219> to<00:05:39.430> the<00:05:40.080> located<00:05:41.080> ships<00:05:41.500> and<00:05:41.889> all

00:05:41.999 --> 00:05:42.009 
are why up to the located ships and all

00:05:42.009 --> 00:05:44.010 
are why up to the located ships and all
that<00:05:42.189> just<00:05:43.120> go<00:05:43.210> ahead<00:05:43.270> and<00:05:43.360> turn<00:05:43.599> this<00:05:43.689> on<00:05:43.840> to

00:05:44.010 --> 00:05:44.020 
that just go ahead and turn this on to

00:05:44.020 --> 00:05:47.399 
that just go ahead and turn this on to
see<00:05:44.169> if<00:05:44.199> it<00:05:44.319> actually<00:05:44.409> works<00:05:44.650> and<00:05:45.189> that<00:05:46.409> is

00:05:47.399 --> 00:05:47.409 
see if it actually works and that is

00:05:47.409 --> 00:05:50.189 
see if it actually works and that is
actually<00:05:47.590> on<00:05:47.949> a<00:05:48.029> hundred<00:05:49.029> force<00:05:49.419> which<00:05:50.169> is

00:05:50.189 --> 00:05:50.199 
actually on a hundred force which is

00:05:50.199 --> 00:05:53.429 
actually on a hundred force which is
actually<00:05:50.529> quite<00:05:51.069> low<00:05:51.870> you<00:05:52.870> see<00:05:53.020> it's<00:05:53.139> actually

00:05:53.429 --> 00:05:53.439 
actually quite low you see it's actually

00:05:53.439 --> 00:05:58.379 
actually quite low you see it's actually
running<00:05:53.650> fairly<00:05:54.219> smoothly<00:05:57.029> and<00:05:58.029> if<00:05:58.150> you<00:05:58.210> go<00:05:58.330> up

00:05:58.379 --> 00:05:58.389 
running fairly smoothly and if you go up

00:05:58.389 --> 00:06:02.189 
running fairly smoothly and if you go up
to<00:05:58.449> how<00:05:58.689> you'll<00:05:58.839> actually<00:05:58.990> see<00:05:59.289> it<00:05:59.379> jump<00:06:01.199> maybe

00:06:02.189 --> 00:06:02.199 
to how you'll actually see it jump maybe

00:06:02.199 --> 00:06:07.860 
to how you'll actually see it jump maybe
or<00:06:02.680> it'll<00:06:02.949> just<00:06:03.129> run<00:06:03.430> really<00:06:04.120> well<00:06:06.870> so

00:06:07.860 --> 00:06:07.870 
or it'll just run really well so

00:06:07.870 --> 00:06:11.999 
or it'll just run really well so
basically<00:06:08.199> this<00:06:08.860> is<00:06:08.919> it<00:06:09.419> that's<00:06:10.419> a<00:06:11.009> fairly

00:06:11.999 --> 00:06:12.009 
basically this is it that's a fairly

00:06:12.009 --> 00:06:13.350 
basically this is it that's a fairly
easy<00:06:12.159> engine<00:06:12.639> you're<00:06:12.909> probably<00:06:13.060> kicking

00:06:13.350 --> 00:06:13.360 
easy engine you're probably kicking

00:06:13.360 --> 00:06:15.390 
easy engine you're probably kicking
yourself<00:06:13.539> thinking<00:06:14.139> how<00:06:14.469> complex<00:06:15.189> it

00:06:15.390 --> 00:06:15.400 
yourself thinking how complex it

00:06:15.400 --> 00:06:18.510 
yourself thinking how complex it
probably<00:06:15.819> would<00:06:15.939> have<00:06:15.969> been<00:06:17.310> now<00:06:18.310> if<00:06:18.430> you

00:06:18.510 --> 00:06:18.520 
probably would have been now if you

00:06:18.520 --> 00:06:20.760 
probably would have been now if you
didn't<00:06:18.789> have<00:06:18.849> the<00:06:19.060> rope<00:06:19.270> at<00:06:20.110> the<00:06:20.289> start<00:06:20.560> that<00:06:20.710> i

00:06:20.760 --> 00:06:20.770 
didn't have the rope at the start that i

00:06:20.770 --> 00:06:24.929 
didn't have the rope at the start that i
showed<00:06:21.639> you<00:06:21.669> in<00:06:21.939> the<00:06:21.969> limiting<00:06:22.919> then<00:06:23.919> if<00:06:24.699> you

00:06:24.929 --> 00:06:24.939 
showed you in the limiting then if you

00:06:24.939 --> 00:06:27.360 
showed you in the limiting then if you
turn<00:06:25.120> this<00:06:25.270> engine<00:06:25.569> up<00:06:25.659> too<00:06:25.839> high<00:06:26.020> the<00:06:26.889> forces

00:06:27.360 --> 00:06:27.370 
turn this engine up too high the forces

00:06:27.370 --> 00:06:33.360 
turn this engine up too high the forces
will<00:06:27.550> actually<00:06:27.909> throw<00:06:30.029> this<00:06:31.029> engine<00:06:32.370> throw

00:06:33.360 --> 00:06:33.370 
will actually throw this engine throw

00:06:33.370 --> 00:06:35.579 
will actually throw this engine throw
the<00:06:33.490> piston<00:06:34.029> sorry<00:06:34.270> passed<00:06:34.689> the<00:06:35.110> crank<00:06:35.379> sure

00:06:35.579 --> 00:06:35.589 
the piston sorry passed the crank sure

00:06:35.589 --> 00:06:37.469 
the piston sorry passed the crank sure
but<00:06:36.039> because<00:06:36.399> of<00:06:36.430> this<00:06:36.639> is<00:06:36.789> roped<00:06:37.089> you

00:06:37.469 --> 00:06:37.479 
but because of this is roped you

00:06:37.479 --> 00:06:41.129 
but because of this is roped you
actually<00:06:37.839> can't<00:06:38.589> physically<00:06:39.689> pull<00:06:40.689> that<00:06:40.899> path

00:06:41.139 --> 00:06:43.320 
actually can't physically pull that path
so<00:06:41.740> it's<00:06:42.009> actually<00:06:42.310> a<00:06:42.490> much<00:06:42.759> more<00:06:43.060> durable

00:06:43.320 --> 00:06:43.330 
so it's actually a much more durable

so it's actually a much more durable

00:06:49.529 --> 00:06:49.539

can<00:06:49.750> probably<00:06:50.020> take<00:06:50.229> a<00:06:50.289> beating

00:07:01.940 --> 00:07:01.950 
if we just throw it up a ground look at
