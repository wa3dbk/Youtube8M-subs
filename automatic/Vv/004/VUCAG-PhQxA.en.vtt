00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:06.520
 Hi there is a cow hideout 

00:00:02.170 --> 00:00:09.640
 The other day I put out gh 4 space recognition af 

00:00:06.520 --> 00:00:14.170
 This is a video about dfd but 

00:00:09.640 --> 00:00:17.400
 Sorry for the big mistake in that video sorry 

00:00:14.170 --> 00:00:17.400
 Sorry, I have not found another excuse 

00:00:20.210 --> 00:00:29.210
 You mentioned earlier, please call Panasonic support. 

00:00:24.619 --> 00:00:29.840
 Pa Naa is'm number is say lumix Pati Kedomo of gh 4 Auto 

00:00:29.210 --> 00:00:33.230
 focus 

00:00:29.840 --> 00:00:36.409
 What does dfd do in Movie mode ? 

00:00:33.230 --> 00:00:40.200
 I a part Tteyuu then whether to operate in Panaraika of the lens 

00:00:36.409 --> 00:00:44.700
 Patty at First It is Aso tried to hear 

00:00:40.200 --> 00:00:46.890
 Other lens is that ok this is Panasonic made even though with that Leica 

00:00:44.700 --> 00:00:50.160
 Nde Teru lens ne This is is ok 

00:00:46.890 --> 00:00:54.660
 I'm sorry 

00:00:50.160 --> 00:00:55.310
 even though is a spatial cognition system dfd technology of gh 4 

00:00:54.660 --> 00:00:59.520
 Huh 

00:00:55.310 --> 00:01:00.750
 It seems that you are definitely listening during video shooting 

00:00:59.520 --> 00:01:04.890
 Yes 

00:01:00.750 --> 00:01:11.640
 I So I hear it's seems to hear 

00:01:04.890 --> 00:01:12.390
 I just listen to it, but it's still much faster than it is in still image mode 

00:01:11.640 --> 00:01:15.930
 Slow and 

00:01:12.390 --> 00:01:20.740
 It is none to say that the manufacturer has not yet put out a is a result of seeking 

00:01:15.930 --> 00:01:25.360
 With Panasonic lenses, you can take pictures and videos 

00:01:20.740 --> 00:01:29.530
 I was told that df Lee works well and that's the answer 

00:01:25.360 --> 00:01:34.210
 It 's dangerous to say that you're going to put out a video before you can get confirmation, right? 

00:01:29.530 --> 00:01:39.399
 It is after to have good even those who are who points out it also in the comments because the previous video 

00:01:34.210 --> 00:01:40.760
 Call support for that sns sound message other than youtube 

00:01:39.399 --> 00:01:45.650
 Please listen and see 

00:01:40.760 --> 00:01:50.630
 Comments fill in in out to Fu such I am happy I was Toka or received a comment 

00:01:45.650 --> 00:01:53.420
 I 've been giving me some Otone hints and so on, so very recently 

00:01:50.630 --> 00:01:58.640
 It is becoming fun to say the youtube activities 

00:01:53.420 --> 00:02:00.750
 Yes, it's been a bit late for the night and I have no time 

00:01:58.640 --> 00:02:06.360
 But after all gh 4 

00:02:00.750 --> 00:02:07.420
 As a user, I would like to experience the evolution of space recognition af 

00:02:06.360 --> 00:02:12.970
 Is it 

00:02:07.420 --> 00:02:18.580
 In the movie mode, you are just convinced that you can not get the speed you thought 

00:02:12.970 --> 00:02:19.390
 Can not therefore this is this is dfd technology I'm space recognition af 

00:02:18.580 --> 00:02:22.690
 I say 

00:02:19.390 --> 00:02:24.550
 I thought as a user and I wonder if seen After doing what little I various Since want c 

00:02:22.690 --> 00:02:27.470
 I tried to think a little bit 

00:02:24.550 --> 00:02:29.650
 I over there it is I Eechotto 

00:02:27.470 --> 00:02:32.280
 Stand up like this 

00:02:29.650 --> 00:02:36.350
 Can you see if you can see a small camera 

00:02:32.280 --> 00:02:41.069
 Aren't gh 4 I guess this is Panasonic 

00:02:36.350 --> 00:02:42.550
 It is 1414010 times the zoom I'll listen to this lens absolutely dnd 

00:02:41.069 --> 00:02:45.610
 See you then 

00:02:42.550 --> 00:02:50.080
 By wearing the gh 4 

00:02:45.610 --> 00:02:54.490
 Hold in continuous shooting mode I 'm from here to the other side 

00:02:50.080 --> 00:02:58.950
 I it 's such or us to follow up where I try to walk I Day 

00:02:54.490 --> 00:02:58.950
 Let's say yes I would like to try a little experiment 

00:03:00.680 --> 00:03:21.770
 ah 4 a 2 f 9 handle new Ehe' sleeping Wa 

00:03:20.700 --> 00:03:27.730
 there is no 

00:03:21.770 --> 00:03:27.730
 I can't fall into the goods or you, or I can give you my intuition 

00:03:33.290 --> 00:03:37.000
 What recognize who I Gyuin 

00:03:49.310 --> 00:03:55.900
 That's right 

00:03:51.280 --> 00:04:01.450
 Also oh well I was thinking action I've finished doing all 

00:03:55.900 --> 00:04:07.260
 Running around the Uo Oh is a good year platelet-old man in front of Well I camera is wanted hilarity Les 

00:04:01.450 --> 00:04:07.260
 It says nothing which is also non-transformation When viewed from the end by hand 

00:04:13.450 --> 00:04:27.940
 Let me booby Udu 

00:04:46.249 --> 00:04:54.799
 It is good that two from 4 are good 

00:04:49.699 --> 00:04:59.449
 Meaning Ne I like Do The photo shows with glee is uncle was O in a full because the know 

00:04:54.799 --> 00:05:03.469
 I'm really sorry but I also felt that I understand 4 at all 

00:04:59.449 --> 00:05:06.240
 I have only three I the lens I honestly I I 

00:05:03.469 --> 00:05:09.840
 This is 12m of Olympus 

00:05:06.240 --> 00:05:12.030
 Brother Store Electronics is already the easiest to use this lens 

00:05:09.840 --> 00:05:18.960
 This is followed in 

00:05:12.030 --> 00:05:19.740
 This uniformly only three in Tsu strength have been used in the experiment at 25 mm f 1 point Yone of Panaraika 

00:05:18.960 --> 00:05:25.440
 It is not 

00:05:19.740 --> 00:05:28.440
 Since the opening in the lens do I'm I Deko' or the day deep social depth, such as pins 

00:05:25.440 --> 00:05:31.610
 Matches're out of that or to have Mowaka' 

00:05:28.440 --> 00:05:36.129
 But the sun has fallen and it has not been too dark. 

00:05:31.610 --> 00:05:41.559
 Found instinct Nde had come true with the ISO band 5000 

00:05:36.129 --> 00:05:43.050
 To really like this Yeah this I think the way is good even good behavior say in dfb 

00:05:41.559 --> 00:05:48.169
 What or against the van 

00:05:43.050 --> 00:05:48.169
 I thought it was because I won with this lens 

00:05:48.950 --> 00:05:55.480
 I'd come up now 

00:05:51.430 --> 00:06:00.340
 It would be nice if it was captured while taking old photos f 1.4 

00:05:55.480 --> 00:06:00.970
 Subject blur caused me to move the battle a little faster shutter speed 

00:06:00.340 --> 00:06:06.750
 Tara 

00:06:00.970 --> 00:06:06.750
 Kana click rider child is the interest the dark about 1600 

00:06:09.969 --> 00:06:12.689

 I'm totally crazy when I see it, or I'll come at all 

00:06:22.719 --> 00:06:25.469
 On a water day 

00:06:25.870 --> 00:06:31.580
 me 

00:06:28.860 --> 00:06:31.580

 Yes Thank No sorry 

00:06:48.330 --> 00:06:59.090
 I will study gh 4 more and more steadily from now on and say 

00:06:53.069 --> 00:07:02.510
 I think let's work hard to become proficient as if part of their own hands 

00:06:59.090 --> 00:07:04.770
 Mr. Wild Luck who gave me a hint then 

00:07:02.510 --> 00:07:06.360
 From Kazufumi Matsutani 

00:07:04.770 --> 00:07:08.080
 Yes Thank you

 So also Baibai did is Gyun and c let's see you 

00:07:11.560 --> 00:07:13.590
 Hmm 

00:07:14.400 --> 00:07:22.710
 Nothing also because yeah extreme clumsiness seemed I Once the dust with 

00:07:18.390 --> 00:07:27.280
 ga local'd really anti-anti-video production in earnest 

00:07:22.710 --> 00:07:31.450
 Because those who are touching it are also used to the Muhonma very much 

00:07:27.280 --> 00:07:36.010
 I also think that I am a half-hearted feeling 

00:07:31.450 --> 00:07:39.520
 softening in Yeah I think I know I Yu tuber I'd wild duck's a 

00:07:36.010 --> 00:07:43.060
 I do some walking diet every day but 

00:07:39.520 --> 00:07:43.969
 Twilight walk while for even Nakane like 

00:07:43.060 --> 00:07:49.989
 Yeah 

00:07:43.969 --> 00:07:49.989
 Something like something like diet tea incompetence is something interesting
