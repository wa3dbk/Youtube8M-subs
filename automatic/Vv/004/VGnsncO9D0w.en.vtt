kind<00:01:41.880> of<00:01:41.939> on<00:01:42.090> a<00:01:42.119> whim<00:01:42.210> and<00:01:42.420> there<00:01:42.689> was<00:01:42.780> some

00:01:42.889 --> 00:01:42.899 
kind of on a whim and there was some

00:01:42.899 --> 00:01:44.510 
kind of on a whim and there was some
stuff<00:01:43.049> on<00:01:43.200> there<00:01:43.350> that<00:01:43.500> wasn't<00:01:43.829> all<00:01:43.950> that<00:01:43.979> bad

00:01:44.510 --> 00:01:44.520 
stuff on there that wasn't all that bad

00:01:44.520 --> 00:01:46.520 
stuff on there that wasn't all that bad
songs<00:01:45.030> like<00:01:45.299> mercy<00:01:45.780> and<00:01:46.020> stuff<00:01:46.229> like<00:01:46.470> that

00:01:46.520 --> 00:01:46.530 
songs like mercy and stuff like that

00:01:46.530 --> 00:01:49.190 
songs like mercy and stuff like that
that<00:01:46.979> had<00:01:47.909> a<00:01:47.939> little<00:01:48.210> catchiness<00:01:48.630> to<00:01:48.899> it<00:01:49.049> that

00:01:49.190 --> 00:01:49.200 
that had a little catchiness to it that

00:01:49.200 --> 00:01:51.440 
that had a little catchiness to it that
was<00:01:49.320> subtle<00:01:49.560> enough<00:01:49.920> that<00:01:50.180> it<00:01:51.180> could<00:01:51.390> be

00:01:51.440 --> 00:01:51.450 
was subtle enough that it could be

00:01:51.450 --> 00:01:54.740 
was subtle enough that it could be
easily<00:01:51.930> discerned<00:01:52.649> by<00:01:53.180> anybody<00:01:54.180> who<00:01:54.420> was

00:01:54.740 --> 00:01:54.750 
easily discerned by anybody who was

00:01:54.750 --> 00:01:57.709 
easily discerned by anybody who was
efficient<00:01:55.409> in<00:01:55.500> music<00:01:55.829> but<00:01:55.860> also<00:01:56.540> at<00:01:57.540> the<00:01:57.689> same

00:01:57.709 --> 00:01:57.719 
efficient in music but also at the same

00:01:57.719 --> 00:02:01.249 
efficient in music but also at the same
time<00:01:58.140> it<00:01:58.439> wasn't<00:01:59.189> something<00:01:59.490> that's<00:02:00.259> was

00:02:01.249 --> 00:02:01.259 
time it wasn't something that's was

00:02:01.259 --> 00:02:03.740 
time it wasn't something that's was
going<00:02:01.439> to<00:02:01.560> blow<00:02:02.280> your<00:02:02.430> mind<00:02:02.490> it<00:02:03.119> didn't<00:02:03.450> need

00:02:03.740 --> 00:02:03.750 
going to blow your mind it didn't need

00:02:03.750 --> 00:02:06.580 
going to blow your mind it didn't need
to<00:02:03.810> be<00:02:03.960> it<00:02:04.290> was<00:02:04.469> simple<00:02:05.070> but<00:02:05.130> it<00:02:05.490> was<00:02:05.520> effective

00:02:06.580 --> 00:02:06.590 
to be it was simple but it was effective

00:02:06.590 --> 00:02:08.869 
to be it was simple but it was effective
however<00:02:07.590> the<00:02:07.740> past<00:02:07.950> couple<00:02:08.220> of<00:02:08.429> years<00:02:08.489> they've

00:02:08.869 --> 00:02:08.879 
however the past couple of years they've

00:02:08.879 --> 00:02:10.639 
however the past couple of years they've
kind<00:02:09.149> of<00:02:09.209> worked<00:02:09.450> to<00:02:09.629> reinvent<00:02:10.080> themselves<00:02:10.259> a

00:02:10.639 --> 00:02:10.649 
kind of worked to reinvent themselves a

00:02:10.649 --> 00:02:12.500 
kind of worked to reinvent themselves a
little<00:02:10.920> bit<00:02:11.039> they've<00:02:11.610> celebrated<00:02:12.300> some

00:02:12.500 --> 00:02:12.510 
little bit they've celebrated some

00:02:12.510 --> 00:02:13.950

00:02:18.210 --> 00:02:18.220 
their sound a little bit closer toward

00:02:18.220 --> 00:02:22.110 
their sound a little bit closer toward
the<00:02:18.580> classic<00:02:19.090> age<00:02:19.360> of<00:02:19.690> Paradise<00:02:20.470> Lost<00:02:21.120> even

more<00:02:35.920> poppy<00:02:36.540> style<00:02:37.540> of<00:02:37.750> formula<00:02:38.170> that<00:02:38.410> was

00:02:38.610 --> 00:02:38.620 
more poppy style of formula that was

00:03:53.970 --> 00:03:53.980 
something that continues to improve upon

00:03:53.980 --> 00:03:56.280 
something that continues to improve upon
itself<00:03:54.430> with<00:03:55.030> each<00:03:55.210> passing<00:03:55.240> track<00:03:55.990> and

00:03:56.280 --> 00:03:56.290 
itself with each passing track and

00:03:56.290 --> 00:03:59.760 
itself with each passing track and
that's<00:03:56.530> a<00:03:56.800> very<00:03:57.580> positive<00:03:58.240> light<00:03:58.930> that<00:03:59.530> this

00:03:59.760 --> 00:03:59.770 
that's a very positive light that this

00:03:59.770 --> 00:04:01.980 
that's a very positive light that this

00:04:01.980 --> 00:04:01.990 
album is able to cast even though it

00:04:01.990 --> 00:04:05.010 
album is able to cast even though it
speaks<00:04:02.440> in<00:04:02.710> the<00:04:02.890> realm<00:04:03.100> of<00:04:03.220> darkness<00:04:03.520> in<00:04:04.020> fact

00:04:33.160 --> 00:04:33.170 
that I fell in love with whenever I

00:04:33.170 --> 00:04:35.650 
that I fell in love with whenever I
initially<00:04:33.470> heard<00:04:33.740> the<00:04:33.920> band<00:04:34.130> and<00:04:34.580> it<00:04:35.390> wasn't

00:04:35.650 --> 00:04:35.660 
initially heard the band and it wasn't

00:04:35.660 --> 00:04:37.000 
initially heard the band and it wasn't
until<00:04:35.750> I<00:04:35.900> kind<00:04:36.110> of<00:04:36.200> got<00:04:36.350> bogged<00:04:36.680> down<00:04:36.890> with

00:04:37.000 --> 00:04:37.010 
until I kind of got bogged down with

00:04:37.010 --> 00:04:39.160 
until I kind of got bogged down with
their<00:04:37.370> identity<00:04:37.790> crisis<00:04:38.240> that<00:04:38.450> I<00:04:38.510> sort<00:04:39.050> of

00:04:39.160 --> 00:04:39.170 
their identity crisis that I sort of

00:04:39.170 --> 00:04:41.560 
their identity crisis that I sort of
wavered<00:04:39.800> a<00:04:39.890> little<00:04:40.100> bit<00:04:40.250> and<00:04:40.430> I<00:04:40.940> wouldn't<00:04:41.450> say

00:04:41.560 --> 00:04:41.570 
wavered a little bit and I wouldn't say

00:04:41.570 --> 00:04:43.240 
wavered a little bit and I wouldn't say
distance<00:04:41.960> myself<00:04:42.110> from<00:04:42.410> the<00:04:42.590> band<00:04:42.800> but<00:04:43.040> rather

00:04:43.240 --> 00:04:43.250 
distance myself from the band but rather

00:04:43.250 --> 00:04:46.900 
distance myself from the band but rather
just<00:04:43.640> didn't<00:04:44.320> speak<00:04:45.320> their<00:04:45.500> name<00:04:45.740> as<00:04:46.160> quickly

00:04:46.900 --> 00:04:46.910 
just didn't speak their name as quickly

00:04:46.910 --> 00:04:48.940 
just didn't speak their name as quickly
as<00:04:47.150> I<00:04:47.330> would<00:04:47.570> perhaps<00:04:47.780> in<00:04:48.050> years<00:04:48.230> past<00:04:48.260> so<00:04:48.740> I

00:04:48.940 --> 00:04:48.950 
as I would perhaps in years past so I

00:04:48.950 --> 00:04:50.410 
as I would perhaps in years past so I
think<00:04:49.490> that's<00:04:49.820> something<00:04:49.940> that's<00:04:50.120> going<00:04:50.330> to

00:04:50.410 --> 00:04:50.420 
think that's something that's going to

00:04:50.420 --> 00:04:52.390 
think that's something that's going to
change<00:04:50.630> within<00:04:51.200> the<00:04:51.320> next<00:04:51.590> couple<00:04:51.770> of<00:04:52.190> months

00:04:52.390 --> 00:04:52.400 
change within the next couple of months

00:04:52.400 --> 00:04:54.340 
change within the next couple of months
because<00:04:52.880> this<00:04:53.090> album<00:04:53.390> will<00:04:53.480> be<00:04:53.540> released<00:04:53.660> and
