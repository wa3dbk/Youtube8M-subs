00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:06.779
 and we leave this morning in Seine 

00:00:04.740 --> 00:00:09.690
 maritime to discover a driving school 

00:00:06.779 --> 00:00:11.309
 a little bit special the good niche 

00:00:09.690 --> 00:00:13.200
 yes it's her name she accompanies a 

00:00:11.309 --> 00:00:15.059
 thirty or so candidates who have never 

00:00:13.200 --> 00:00:16.800
 could pass the permit because of problems 

00:00:15.059 --> 00:00:18.810
 financial or linguistic 

00:00:16.800 --> 00:00:20.369
 people in precarious situations is 

00:00:18.810 --> 00:00:22.439
 all the more excluded from the market of 

00:00:20.369 --> 00:00:26.180
 employment they are not mobile a 

00:00:22.439 --> 00:00:26.180
 reporting guillon parking with iph annuity 

00:00:26.810 --> 00:00:33.210
 it's his second hour of driving I 

00:00:31.980 --> 00:00:35.280
 the back door and sophie 

00:00:33.210 --> 00:00:41.910
 the informant reminds her of the 

00:00:35.280 --> 00:00:43.680
 basic tips before starting his 

00:00:41.910 --> 00:00:45.690
 sight with some notions he already had 

00:00:43.680 --> 00:00:48.090
 drove to his country in iraq but without 

00:00:45.690 --> 00:00:49.379
 allowed and without succession 

00:00:48.090 --> 00:00:49.860
 gently your left foot slowly 

00:00:49.379 --> 00:00:52.199
 all needed 

00:00:49.860 --> 00:00:54.030
 arrived in France in 2010 as a refugee 

00:00:52.199 --> 00:00:55.620
 politics he works today in 

00:00:54.030 --> 00:00:57.899
 an integration project and 

00:00:55.620 --> 00:00:59.250
 imperatively need the permit then 

00:00:57.899 --> 00:01:00.210
 his boss steer him towards this 

00:00:59.250 --> 00:01:01.829
 social driving school 

00:01:00.210 --> 00:01:04.470
 it is intended for applicants 

00:01:01.829 --> 00:01:06.780
 excluded from work because of lack of 

00:01:04.470 --> 00:01:08.010
 means of travel and also to 

00:01:06.780 --> 00:01:10.080
 people come from 

00:01:08.010 --> 00:01:13.500
 immigration and who have difficulties 

00:01:10.080 --> 00:01:15.900
 on the vocabulary on understanding 

00:01:13.500 --> 00:01:17.640
 in general the turnings of sentences due to 

00:01:15.900 --> 00:01:19.710
 their nationality to the understanding of 

00:01:17.640 --> 00:01:22.380
 the language that is not actually complete 

00:01:19.710 --> 00:01:24.540
 by working on his code obtained from 

00:01:22.380 --> 00:01:27.600
 first hit samir also progressed in 

00:01:24.540 --> 00:01:29.159
 French - work a lot but everything 

00:01:27.600 --> 00:01:31.470
 the time the code votes with me 

00:01:29.159 --> 00:01:33.430
 even 

00:01:31.470 --> 00:01:38.260
 Madame Sophie there 

00:01:33.430 --> 00:01:40.870
 and everything is very difficult where the 

00:01:38.260 --> 00:01:43.000
 tradition after for me one for them 

00:01:40.870 --> 00:01:43.630
 others because here we take the time 

00:01:43.000 --> 00:01:47.920
 learn 

00:01:43.630 --> 00:01:49.720
 so if the whites without anything the 

00:01:47.920 --> 00:01:51.520
 code training lasts long close to 

00:01:49.720 --> 00:01:55.390
 120 hours no questions answered 

00:01:51.520 --> 00:01:56.470
 exam types everything is hulled the 

00:01:55.390 --> 00:01:57.880
 problem is that on the auto school 

00:01:56.470 --> 00:01:58.869
 classic I was already enrolled but 

00:01:57.880 --> 00:02:01.360
 problem is that I have a lot of 

00:01:58.869 --> 00:02:03.060
 difficulties in memorizing the 

00:02:01.360 --> 00:02:04.990
 understand that's why I was 

00:02:03.060 --> 00:02:07.119
 sent on good niche for that I 

00:02:04.990 --> 00:02:09.009
 can easily learn pedagogy 

00:02:07.119 --> 00:02:10.690
 adapted and accessible prices for 

00:02:09.009 --> 00:02:12.489
 people in precarious situations 

00:02:10.690 --> 00:02:14.320
 the amount varies according to income 

00:02:12.489 --> 00:02:16.150
 we are not in the audience we are 

00:02:14.320 --> 00:02:19.239
 really about access to law and we 

00:02:16.150 --> 00:02:20.590
 realized that in fact they could not 

00:02:19.239 --> 00:02:24.190
 be 

00:02:20.590 --> 00:02:26.050
 in mobility slows down any project 

00:02:24.190 --> 00:02:28.420
 social or professional integration 

00:02:26.050 --> 00:02:30.970
 samir should for example pay close to 

00:02:28.420 --> 00:02:31.440
 600 euros out of 2500 of the permit of 

00:02:30.970 --> 00:02:34.840
 drive 

00:02:31.440 --> 00:02:37.209
 samir is a rsa beneficiaries that's at 

00:02:34.840 --> 00:02:40.750
 to say that he is at rsa but in parallel 

00:02:37.209 --> 00:02:42.970
 he is in the process of insertion and therefore 

00:02:40.750 --> 00:02:44.980
 with this recognition rsa that him 

00:02:42.970 --> 00:02:47.500
 allows to have a help an allowance 

00:02:44.980 --> 00:02:47.920
 which covers a big part of his 

00:02:47.500 --> 00:02:50.110
 allowed 

00:02:47.920 --> 00:02:52.030
 at the end of the construction he would like 

00:02:50.110 --> 00:02:55.680
 look for work as an electrician a 

00:02:52.030 --> 00:02:55.680
 job where daily mobility
