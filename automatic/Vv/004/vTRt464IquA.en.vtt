00:00:55.559 --> 00:00:59.460
 news 

00:00:57.050 --> 00:01:01.770
 river in my opinion is well finally I 

00:00:59.460 --> 00:01:03.439
 find that ruben and well we'll find 

00:01:01.770 --> 00:01:06.049
 that the two pairs are not bad 

00:01:03.439 --> 00:01:09.380
 distance preferred the old z 

00:01:06.049 --> 00:01:11.400
 but the good thing is that my personal opinion 

00:01:09.380 --> 00:01:15.180
 he had a smile is stronger so 

00:01:11.400 --> 00:01:20.040
 it must not be that but me see 

00:01:15.180 --> 00:01:22.080
 kind of they are prevented from following he has 

00:01:20.040 --> 00:01:25.320
 helped the theme I wanted to hide I 

00:01:22.080 --> 00:01:26.640
 missed no small spi million +12 spin 

00:01:25.320 --> 00:01:30.420
 hill dogs of all we are going 

00:01:26.640 --> 00:01:32.900
 wait for the cusems I still have not good 

00:01:30.420 --> 00:01:32.900
 sense by room 

00:01:34.330 --> 00:01:36.990
 then there on the other hand 

00:01:38.130 --> 00:01:42.869
 hong kong posted yesterday anyway 

00:01:41.490 --> 00:01:44.460
 no less than 50% in one against 

00:01:42.869 --> 00:01:51.060
 one against one z 

00:01:44.460 --> 00:01:54.920
 there's the he's killing the pop yeah so we're gonna 

00:01:51.060 --> 00:01:54.920
 not going there he stalled exist behind 

00:02:01.180 --> 00:02:07.630
 i just had to td water with i would have 

00:02:03.760 --> 00:02:09.310
 clearly lost climbed a match on 

00:02:07.630 --> 00:02:13.870
 interesting match a little pity of 

00:02:09.310 --> 00:02:15.160
 ruin the fight night 

00:02:13.870 --> 00:02:18.930
 so here I wanted there to be some 

00:02:15.160 --> 00:02:18.930
 thing he has plated everything so so nickel 

00:02:19.740 --> 00:02:29.560
 it's not their goal to kill I do not 

00:02:22.000 --> 00:02:32.110
 could not ok ambac editing is good 

00:02:29.560 --> 00:02:34.540
 the same I could have tried a flash on 

00:02:32.110 --> 00:02:36.040
 my third weakest for him mq 

00:02:34.540 --> 00:02:38.170
 automatons aguilar may be killed but 

00:02:36.040 --> 00:02:40.180
 it would be 7 dead too so we're going 

00:02:38.170 --> 00:02:40.840
 play security in quotation marks and one 

00:02:40.180 --> 00:02:43.200
 do not try it 

00:02:40.840 --> 00:02:45.700
 we go to school we'll be friends 

00:02:43.200 --> 00:02:47.410
 and the city ​​simply and the potions 

00:02:45.700 --> 00:02:51.150
 or to shake very quickly 

00:02:47.410 --> 00:02:51.150
 once again agree 

00:02:54.319 --> 00:03:01.769
 but a complete project for fail whale 

00:02:59.730 --> 00:03:05.219
 level 3 who took a michel abut on 

00:03:01.769 --> 00:03:06.450
 aggression he will recover my goal 

00:03:05.219 --> 00:03:08.989
 maybe we'll see if the team blot 

00:03:06.450 --> 00:03:14.129
 contests it is obviously useless 

00:03:08.989 --> 00:03:15.319
 were seen compact can control the 

00:03:14.129 --> 00:03:17.909
 body is going to be mine 

00:03:15.319 --> 00:03:20.519
 the trade hp we get the ebook at 

00:03:17.909 --> 00:03:22.439
 final one is largely winning we're going 

00:03:20.519 --> 00:03:23.790
 recover all that he left on Klose 

00:03:22.439 --> 00:03:26.299
 we got a lot more c is that 

00:03:23.790 --> 00:03:29.040
 so we have a lot more gaulle 

00:03:26.299 --> 00:03:29.909
 why not it rained barrier it has more 

00:03:29.040 --> 00:03:34.010
 nothing 

00:03:29.909 --> 00:03:34.010
 So we have more than they kill what 

00:03:34.669 --> 00:03:37.669
 what 

00:03:38.810 --> 00:03:44.489
 it is true that he had put me exists 

00:03:40.829 --> 00:03:45.740
 fucking I clearly bugged the place a 

00:03:44.489 --> 00:03:46.760
 for once 

00:03:45.740 --> 00:03:49.520
 to mess up I think that granny them 

00:03:46.760 --> 00:03:52.190
 others just now I completely 

00:03:49.520 --> 00:03:58.690
 cracked ok that but after he had everything 

00:03:52.190 --> 00:04:00.500
 plated but not at all actually hamad 

00:03:58.690 --> 00:04:03.080
 good it's okay so much better so much 

00:04:00.500 --> 00:04:04.910
 better it's going to dive the 1 v1 turns out to be 

00:04:03.080 --> 00:04:06.740
 interesting you like a lot 

00:04:04.910 --> 00:04:08.480
 ok we avoided the spin we are deaf is 

00:04:06.740 --> 00:04:09.740
 mates would promulgate mistakes we will have the 

00:04:08.480 --> 00:04:11.840
 end of the art is maybe during his 

00:04:09.740 --> 00:04:12.980
 level up during my six good label 

00:04:11.840 --> 00:04:14.210
 maximum pharand lenses so at worst 

00:04:12.980 --> 00:04:16.459
 we can win by the crs but hey 

00:04:14.210 --> 00:04:17.360
 this is the method a little bit finally that 

00:04:16.459 --> 00:04:20.390
 I like it the least because it's the 

00:04:17.360 --> 00:04:24.680
 cowes method of people who do not have 

00:04:20.390 --> 00:04:27.800
 I think that way we want to win 

00:04:24.680 --> 00:04:30.770
 with glory and with class ok level 6 

00:04:27.800 --> 00:04:35.180
 tons good I believe for a hundred thousand 

00:04:30.770 --> 00:04:38.000
 euros they break polony at home 

00:04:35.180 --> 00:04:42.050
 that at that moment he recovered it in 

00:04:38.000 --> 00:04:43.280
 halted at level 6 he is they are at it 

00:04:42.050 --> 00:04:45.620
 so is ideal would be to snap 

00:04:43.280 --> 00:04:48.340
 his z before my queuing there I try 

00:04:45.620 --> 00:04:48.340
 to give on his henchmen 

00:04:50.530 --> 00:04:56.389
 which head is going to lift the 

00:04:53.930 --> 00:04:57.740
 bottle does not know he has more he 

00:04:56.389 --> 00:05:00.830
 support his clone and he has the vision 

00:04:57.740 --> 00:05:04.100
 unfortunately I have to go out task 

00:05:00.830 --> 00:05:09.860
 level if dexia lammer was not 

00:05:04.100 --> 00:05:14.889
 approached brought to people for him and the 

00:05:09.860 --> 00:05:17.120
 bin being clearly visible so the 1st 

00:05:14.889 --> 00:05:18.889
 precisely to activate the r 

00:05:17.120 --> 00:05:19.940
 how time after aggression because 

00:05:18.889 --> 00:05:21.470
 that they were in couple of number he 

00:05:19.940 --> 00:05:25.250
 is finally he had no flash he had 

00:05:21.470 --> 00:05:27.590
 over his leader and he was dead I 

00:05:25.250 --> 00:05:29.450
 guarded the ultimate he did not have his 

00:05:27.590 --> 00:05:30.650
 level 6 no longer in this match reeves 

00:05:29.450 --> 00:05:33.860
 is this a very interesting match when 

00:05:30.650 --> 00:05:35.419
 you jump on the z with your er not 

00:05:33.860 --> 00:05:36.919
 do not click the sound what very often 

00:05:35.419 --> 00:05:37.910
 the helpers will snap their ultimate at 

00:05:36.919 --> 00:05:39.350
 time of your task 

00:05:37.910 --> 00:05:40.970
 so if you put your zeal for 

00:05:39.350 --> 00:05:43.070
 its ultimate it's fast your life life 

00:05:40.970 --> 00:05:44.030
 of your style vivo damage and then in 

00:05:43.070 --> 00:05:44.690
 the more you will make banana that's 

00:05:44.030 --> 00:05:46.250
 when he will arrive 

00:05:44.690 --> 00:05:48.530
 isa pop he's going to put his sister he's going 

00:05:46.250 --> 00:05:49.790
 change this is with his clone he goes 

00:05:48.530 --> 00:05:52.490
 make you a little crazy and if you do 

00:05:49.790 --> 00:05:54.350
 that you are going to join in 

00:05:52.490 --> 00:05:56.240
 time dates in order to buy on him 

00:05:54.350 --> 00:05:58.640
 do the math if the guy repopulate as 

00:05:56.240 --> 00:05:59.870
 you read but damage and so on 

00:05:58.640 --> 00:06:01.010
 snap long before a queue 

00:05:59.870 --> 00:06:02.810
 to avoid luxury 

00:06:01.010 --> 00:06:04.190
 and so that's what I can 

00:06:02.810 --> 00:06:05.450
 advise a very interesting match 

00:06:04.190 --> 00:06:07.430
 gold I can not necessarily analyzed so 

00:06:05.450 --> 00:06:09.100
 I play more than that but I hope that 

00:06:07.430 --> 00:06:12.560
 you liked it's sky arts for a game 

00:06:09.100 --> 00:06:14.150
 a game for the next youtube 

00:06:12.560 --> 00:06:15.470
 So Giraille risk elsewhere and 

00:06:14.150 --> 00:06:16.910
 sexy neighborhood which I drag myself and 

00:06:15.470 --> 00:06:19.250
 back in both channels how 

00:06:16.910 --> 00:06:21.530
 could reach 10 not badly I 

00:06:19.250 --> 00:06:22.639
 advises dorel shield and aireth buddy 

00:06:21.530 --> 00:06:24.710
 so what I took is really 

00:06:22.639 --> 00:06:26.060
 very strong abuse of consumables and 

00:06:24.710 --> 00:06:27.289
 have fun friends we're fine 

00:06:26.060 --> 00:06:29.090

00:06:27.289 --> 00:06:30.530
 I like this maples the boche 

00:06:29.090 --> 00:06:32.690
 who have risen relatively 

00:06:30.530 --> 00:06:34.940
 that the goals are a bit crazy and 

00:06:32.690 --> 00:06:37.039
 control everything is not bad it paid 

00:06:34.940 --> 00:06:39.260
 that's not too prejudicial for the 

00:06:37.039 --> 00:06:40.250
 case that they can neither which that 

00:06:39.260 --> 00:06:41.479
 do not have all this so it's really 

00:06:40.250 --> 00:06:43.250
 cool me I appreciate so much 

00:06:41.479 --> 00:06:45.970
 I hope you enjoy it and have fun or 

00:06:43.250 --> 00:06:45.970
 good friends see you soon 

00:06:48.080 --> 00:06:53.139
 no one join us on the links 

00:06:49.759 --> 00:06:53.139
 who are below gave us the idea
