00:00:16.800 --> 00:00:20.609

00:00:22.680 --> 00:00:26.820
 won his battery went straight to the 

00:00:24.930 --> 00:00:29.099
 third round but all this included 

00:00:26.820 --> 00:00:31.349
 the batteries of kelly slater mick fanning 

00:00:29.099 --> 00:00:33.600

00:01:34.659 --> 00:01:37.770
 kiss call me 

00:02:14.769 --> 00:02:20.030
 I saw you were entering this event 

00:02:17.269 --> 00:02:23.030
 this time in a strange tube 

00:02:20.030 --> 00:02:25.790
 so I decided to put the minors 

00:02:23.030 --> 00:02:28.400
 eff where I took greater note and 

00:02:25.790 --> 00:02:32.660
 I took a beck that I did not even think 

00:02:28.400 --> 00:02:35.510
 to count and ended up counting there are s 

00:02:32.660 --> 00:02:37.099
 to earn a point by just one point and 

00:02:35.510 --> 00:02:38.480
 winning is already good so the important thing is 

00:02:37.099 --> 00:02:40.549
 to pass the battery I never had this 

00:02:38.480 --> 00:02:42.530
 Twisted here again I'd come a third 

00:02:40.549 --> 00:02:46.900
 fourth year here I never had twisted is 

00:02:42.530 --> 00:02:46.900
 so it 's an extra force
