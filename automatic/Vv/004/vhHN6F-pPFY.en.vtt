00:00:07.174 --> 00:00:10.552
Hi, we are at the beach to talk 
about a very popular shotgun...

00:00:10.552 --> 00:00:12.292
the RODE NTG-2.

00:00:12.292 --> 00:00:15.265
We'll see it in detail and 
compare it's sound when plugged

00:00:15.265 --> 00:00:16.225
straight to the camera...

00:00:16.225 --> 00:00:17.476
through a compact 
preamplifier...

00:00:17.476 --> 00:00:20.437
and to an external recorder, 
join me.

00:00:20.437 --> 00:00:25.150
The RODE NTG-2 it's a condenser 
shotgun microphone...

00:00:25.150 --> 00:00:29.363
designed mainly for video 
productions.

00:00:29.363 --> 00:00:32.616
It's frequency response goes 
from 20Hz to 20KHz

00:00:32.616 --> 00:00:34.667
and features a supercardioid 
polar pattern...

00:00:34.667 --> 00:00:38.288
which offers a lot of 
directionality, cancelling 
sounds from the sides

00:00:38.288 --> 00:00:44.002
and capturing mainly what's in 
front of it.

00:00:44.002 --> 00:00:48.131
It has an XLR connection and a 
good aluminum construction...

00:00:48.131 --> 00:00:52.886
measuring 28cm long and 2cm in 
diameter.

00:00:52.886 --> 00:00:55.722
It weights only 160g without a 
battery...

00:00:55.722 --> 00:00:59.709
which makes it practical to use 
in any situation.

00:00:59.709 --> 00:01:02.334
It comes with a standard wind 
filter...

00:01:02.334 --> 00:01:05.440
a plastic mount for stands, 
tripods or boompoles...

00:01:05.440 --> 00:01:08.443
and a bag to store it all.

00:01:08.443 --> 00:01:12.155
It needs phantom power or a 
single AA battery to work

00:01:12.155 --> 00:01:15.367
which allows us to use it in 
many ways

00:01:15.367 --> 00:01:18.584
like the ones we'll compare 
next.

00:01:18.584 --> 00:01:23.333
First, let's hear the audio 
recorded directly by our 
camera...

00:01:23.333 --> 00:01:24.710
the Canon T3i...

00:01:24.710 --> 00:01:27.671
so we have a starting point of 
reference.

00:01:27.671 --> 00:01:30.048
This is the internal microphone 
of the Canon T3i.

00:01:30.048 --> 00:01:32.759
It probably sounds awful and it's 
unusable.

00:01:32.759 --> 00:01:36.054
1, 2, 3, testing sound.

00:01:36.054 --> 00:01:39.057
Now, we'll plug the microphone 
directly into the camera

00:01:39.057 --> 00:01:44.896
using a XLR to 3.5mm adapter 
cable.

00:01:44.896 --> 00:01:49.234
This is the RODE NTG-2 plugged 
straight into the Canon T3i.

00:01:49.234 --> 00:01:51.653
The sound should be pretty 
decent.

00:01:51.653 --> 00:01:54.489
1, 2, 3, testing sound.

00:01:54.489 --> 00:01:57.075
Next, we'll plug the microphone 
to the camera through

00:01:57.075 --> 00:02:01.788
an external preamplifier, the 
JuicedLink CX211.

00:02:01.788 --> 00:02:04.499
This will allow us to increase 
the gain of the microphone

00:02:04.499 --> 00:02:08.003
while reducing unwanted noise.

00:02:08.003 --> 00:02:13.675
It also gives us controls to 
adjust our recording levels in 
real time.

00:02:13.675 --> 00:02:18.638
This is the RODE NTG-2 plugged 
into the JuicedLink CX211...

00:02:18.638 --> 00:02:20.265
plugged into the Canon T3i.

00:02:20.265 --> 00:02:22.434
The sound should be pretty good 
right now

00:02:22.434 --> 00:02:24.644
and it's a very popular 
combination.

00:02:24.644 --> 00:02:27.898
1, 2, 3, testing sound.

00:02:27.898 --> 00:02:32.694
Now, we'll plug the microphone 
to an external recorder, the 
Zoom H4n.

00:02:32.694 --> 00:02:36.156
This allow us to record at the 
maximum quality of 24bit

00:02:36.156 --> 00:02:40.827
but it requires synching in 
postproduction.

00:02:40.827 --> 00:02:44.998
This is the RODE NTG-2 plugged 
straight into the Zoom H4n.

00:02:44.998 --> 00:02:47.125
The sound should be very good 
right now...

00:02:47.125 --> 00:02:49.795
although it may not be as clean 
as the previous combination.

00:02:49.795 --> 00:02:53.048
1, 2, 3, testing sound.

00:02:53.048 --> 00:02:57.135
Lastly, we'll plug the 
microphone into the JuicedLink 
CX211

00:02:57.135 --> 00:02:59.638
and then into the Zoom H4n 
recorder.

00:02:59.638 --> 00:03:05.852
This gives us the best possible 
recording quality and clean 
gain.

00:03:05.852 --> 00:03:10.107
It also is the best option to 
control sound levels and

00:03:10.107 --> 00:03:13.402
to monitor the audio while 
recording.

00:03:13.402 --> 00:03:17.322
This is the RODE NTG-2 plugged 
into the JuicedLink CX211

00:03:17.322 --> 00:03:18.990
and the Zoom H4n.

00:03:18.990 --> 00:03:21.910
The sound should be excellent 
right now and it's the

00:03:21.910 --> 00:03:25.664
configuration we use in most of 
our productions.

00:03:25.664 --> 00:03:29.710
1, 2, 3, testing sound.

00:03:29.710 --> 00:03:33.422
This microphone is excellent for
dialog or interview recordings

00:03:33.422 --> 00:03:35.632
thanks to its diretionality.

00:03:35.632 --> 00:03:38.427
Here are some examples of 
productions where we

00:03:38.427 --> 00:03:42.055
have used the RODE NTG-2 in 
various situations.

00:03:42.055 --> 00:03:47.144
vivirmedios.com it's a platform 
completely in Spanish...

00:03:47.144 --> 00:03:51.751
sharing all kinds of information
thanks to the internet...

00:03:51.751 --> 00:03:54.609
I invite all the employees of 
Polar Enterprises...

00:03:54.609 --> 00:03:56.778
to participate in the community 
activities...

00:03:56.778 --> 00:03:59.448
and revalidate the title of La 
Liga BBVA...

00:03:59.448 --> 00:04:01.658
get to the final of the 
Champions...

00:04:01.658 --> 00:04:05.871
promote, distribute, create and 
protect...

00:04:05.871 --> 00:04:09.875
(Inaudible)

00:04:09.875 --> 00:04:13.879
you can't miss "A Soldier's 
Memories", 100% recommended...

00:04:13.879 --> 00:04:21.250
(Inaudible)

00:04:26.766 --> 00:04:29.144
he stole the show...

00:04:29.144 --> 00:04:33.023
We recommend using some extra 
protection against the wind.

00:04:33.023 --> 00:04:37.360
We use the "Deadcat" designed 
speciafically for this model.

00:04:37.360 --> 00:04:41.000
Hear the difference it produces 
on a windy day.

00:04:52.250 --> 00:04:58.215
The only negative we have found 
with the NTG-2 is the battery 
tray...

00:04:58.215 --> 00:05:01.635
which can get stuck on 
ocassiones and makes it 
difficult

00:05:01.635 --> 00:05:05.514
when opening it or closing it.

00:05:05.514 --> 00:05:07.891
If you buy a RODE microphone 
don't forget to register it 

00:05:07.891 --> 00:05:11.812
on their website because they 
offer an excellent 10 year 
warranty.

00:05:11.812 --> 00:05:13.814
The NTG-2 is one of the most 
popular microphones because of

00:05:13.814 --> 00:05:15.607
its excellent quality and price.

00:05:15.607 --> 00:05:20.000
We always use it in our work, 
that's why we can safely 
recommend it.
