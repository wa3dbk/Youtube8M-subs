the<00:00:05.470> attraction<00:00:05.770> control<00:00:06.190> goes<00:00:06.400> away<00:00:06.640> next

00:00:06.870 --> 00:00:06.880 
the attraction control goes away next

00:00:06.880 --> 00:00:08.970 
the attraction control goes away next
year<00:00:07.029> so<00:00:07.480> what<00:00:07.600> does<00:00:07.720> it<00:00:07.840> describe<00:00:08.230> how<00:00:08.559> it

00:00:08.970 --> 00:00:08.980 
year so what does it describe how it

00:00:08.980 --> 00:00:10.650 
year so what does it describe how it
feels<00:00:09.160> when<00:00:09.400> it<00:00:09.550> comes<00:00:09.790> in<00:00:10.030> when<00:00:10.240> the<00:00:10.330> traction

00:00:10.650 --> 00:00:10.660 
feels when it comes in when the traction

00:00:10.660 --> 00:00:12.360 
feels when it comes in when the traction
control<00:00:10.690> comes<00:00:11.290> in<00:00:11.500> the<00:00:11.650> gentleman<00:00:12.040> wants<00:00:12.250> to

00:00:12.360 --> 00:00:12.370 
control comes in the gentleman wants to

00:00:12.370 --> 00:00:14.430 
control comes in the gentleman wants to
know<00:00:12.490> well<00:00:12.820> as<00:00:12.970> soon<00:00:13.210> especially<00:00:13.809> in<00:00:14.140> this<00:00:14.230> low

00:00:14.430 --> 00:00:14.440 
know well as soon especially in this low

00:00:14.440 --> 00:00:16.800 
know well as soon especially in this low
speed<00:00:14.710> corners<00:00:14.740> with<00:00:15.370> a<00:00:15.400> low<00:00:15.610> gear<00:00:15.970> when<00:00:16.630> there

00:00:16.800 --> 00:00:16.810 
speed corners with a low gear when there

00:00:16.810 --> 00:00:20.519 
speed corners with a low gear when there
is<00:00:16.900> a<00:00:16.930> lot<00:00:17.140> of<00:00:17.230> talk<00:00:18.330> usually<00:00:19.330> even<00:00:20.080> with<00:00:20.500> a

00:00:20.519 --> 00:00:20.529 
is a lot of talk usually even with a

00:00:20.529 --> 00:00:22.950 
is a lot of talk usually even with a
with<00:00:20.860> a<00:00:20.890> normal<00:00:21.250> car<00:00:21.460> if<00:00:21.669> if<00:00:22.210> you<00:00:22.450> go<00:00:22.720> full

00:00:22.950 --> 00:00:22.960 
with a normal car if if you go full

00:00:22.960 --> 00:00:24.810 
with a normal car if if you go full
throttle<00:00:23.020> position<00:00:23.439> you<00:00:23.980> have<00:00:24.099> some<00:00:24.340> some

00:00:24.810 --> 00:00:24.820 
throttle position you have some some

00:00:24.820 --> 00:00:27.870 
throttle position you have some some
wisping<00:00:25.239> as<00:00:26.140> soon<00:00:26.439> the<00:00:26.590> way<00:00:26.739> spin<00:00:27.040> comes<00:00:27.430> out

00:00:27.870 --> 00:00:27.880 
wisping as soon the way spin comes out

00:00:27.880 --> 00:00:33.120 
wisping as soon the way spin comes out
there<00:00:28.450> is<00:00:28.599> a<00:00:29.369> system<00:00:30.369> who<00:00:31.060> helps<00:00:31.599> the<00:00:31.960> the<00:00:32.770> way

00:00:33.120 --> 00:00:33.130 
there is a system who helps the the way

00:00:33.130 --> 00:00:36.530 
there is a system who helps the the way
spin<00:00:33.430> so<00:00:33.910> the<00:00:34.809> engine<00:00:35.170> does<00:00:35.590> a<00:00:35.620> different

00:00:36.530 --> 00:00:36.540 
spin so the engine does a different

00:00:36.540 --> 00:00:41.490 
spin so the engine does a different
sound<00:00:37.540> different<00:00:38.140> noise<00:00:38.550> very<00:00:39.550> rough<00:00:39.990> but<00:00:40.990> the

00:00:41.490 --> 00:00:41.500 
sound different noise very rough but the

00:00:41.500 --> 00:00:45.830 
sound different noise very rough but the
way<00:00:41.650> spin<00:00:41.950> it's<00:00:42.370> really<00:00:44.460> let's<00:00:45.460> say

00:00:45.830 --> 00:00:45.840 
way spin it's really let's say

00:00:45.840 --> 00:00:49.110 
way spin it's really let's say
controlled<00:00:46.840> by<00:00:47.200> by<00:00:47.650> by<00:00:48.610> the<00:00:48.670> traction<00:00:49.090> control

00:00:49.110 --> 00:00:49.120 
controlled by by by the traction control

00:00:49.120 --> 00:00:53.580 
controlled by by by the traction control
so<00:00:50.080> there<00:00:50.230> is<00:00:50.350> very<00:00:50.590> small<00:00:51.280> amount<00:00:51.610> of<00:00:52.290> we<00:00:53.290> spin

00:00:53.580 --> 00:00:53.590 
so there is very small amount of we spin

00:00:53.590 --> 00:00:57.750 
so there is very small amount of we spin
and<00:00:53.830> but<00:00:54.820> it's<00:00:54.970> not<00:00:55.210> because<00:00:56.200> we<00:00:56.980> can<00:00:57.160> charge

00:00:57.750 --> 00:00:57.760 
and but it's not because we can charge

00:00:57.760 --> 00:01:00.780 
and but it's not because we can charge
it<00:00:57.940> it's<00:00:58.390> just<00:00:58.720> the<00:00:59.380> car<00:00:59.620> just<00:01:00.160> the<00:01:00.280> guys<00:01:00.460> doing

00:01:00.780 --> 00:01:00.790 
it it's just the car just the guys doing

00:01:00.790 --> 00:01:04.590 
it it's just the car just the guys doing
that<00:01:01.000> so<00:01:01.420> it's<00:01:01.630> the<00:01:01.960> drivers<00:01:02.410> it's<00:01:03.600> it's

00:01:04.590 --> 00:01:04.600 
that so it's the drivers it's it's

00:01:04.600 --> 00:01:08.160 
that so it's the drivers it's it's
important<00:01:05.290> but<00:01:05.439> not<00:01:05.619> that<00:01:06.280> important<00:01:07.030> if<00:01:07.960> we

00:01:08.160 --> 00:01:08.170 
important but not that important if we

00:01:08.170 --> 00:01:10.889 
important but not that important if we
drive<00:01:08.380> without<00:01:09.069> it<00:01:09.310> so<00:01:10.179> do<00:01:10.329> you<00:01:10.420> tunnel<00:01:10.780> in

00:01:10.889 --> 00:01:10.899 
drive without it so do you tunnel in

00:01:10.899 --> 00:01:12.300 
drive without it so do you tunnel in
traction<00:01:11.170> control<00:01:11.649> throughout<00:01:11.950> the<00:01:12.100> diet

00:01:12.300 --> 00:01:12.310 
traction control throughout the diet

00:01:12.310 --> 00:01:13.800 
traction control throughout the diet
throughout<00:01:12.640> the<00:01:12.789> rise<00:01:12.969> over<00:01:13.149> the<00:01:13.359> weekend

00:01:13.800 --> 00:01:13.810 
throughout the rise over the weekend

00:01:13.810 --> 00:01:14.940 
throughout the rise over the weekend
would<00:01:13.960> you<00:01:14.049> ever<00:01:14.109> on<00:01:14.289> one<00:01:14.319> setting<00:01:14.740> for<00:01:14.890> the

00:01:14.940 --> 00:01:14.950 
would you ever on one setting for the

00:01:14.950 --> 00:01:16.440 
would you ever on one setting for the
reisen's<00:01:15.310> change<00:01:15.609> it<00:01:15.759> on<00:01:15.850> the<00:01:15.880> Friday<00:01:16.179> how

00:01:16.440 --> 00:01:16.450 
reisen's change it on the Friday how

00:01:16.450 --> 00:01:17.819 
reisen's change it on the Friday how
does<00:01:16.600> it<00:01:16.689> work<00:01:16.869> in<00:01:17.049> terms<00:01:17.170> of<00:01:17.469> changing<00:01:17.799> the

00:01:17.819 --> 00:01:17.829 
does it work in terms of changing the

00:01:17.829 --> 00:01:22.109 
does it work in terms of changing the
setting<00:01:18.189> well<00:01:18.670> we<00:01:18.850> got<00:01:19.409> settings<00:01:20.409> we<00:01:20.859> can<00:01:21.119> we

00:01:22.109 --> 00:01:22.119 
setting well we got settings we can we

00:01:22.119 --> 00:01:26.099 
setting well we got settings we can we
have<00:01:22.210> a<00:01:22.240> six<00:01:22.780> seven<00:01:23.109> position<00:01:23.679> from<00:01:24.399> low<00:01:25.109> let's

00:01:26.099 --> 00:01:26.109 
have a six seven position from low let's

00:01:26.109 --> 00:01:29.550 
have a six seven position from low let's
say<00:01:26.819> traction<00:01:27.819> control<00:01:28.210> to<00:01:28.420> very<00:01:29.259> tight

00:01:29.550 --> 00:01:29.560 
say traction control to very tight

00:01:29.560 --> 00:01:32.279 
say traction control to very tight
traction<00:01:30.310> control<00:01:30.729> and<00:01:30.999> we<00:01:31.659> can<00:01:31.689> change<00:01:32.079> it

00:01:32.279 --> 00:01:32.289 
traction control and we can change it

00:01:32.289 --> 00:01:35.129 
traction control and we can change it
even<00:01:32.469> by<00:01:33.399> corner<00:01:33.850> to<00:01:33.999> corner<00:01:34.179> during<00:01:34.689> the<00:01:34.959> race

00:01:35.129 --> 00:01:35.139 
even by corner to corner during the race

00:01:35.139 --> 00:01:40.080 
even by corner to corner during the race
so<00:01:35.920> as<00:01:36.249> as<00:01:37.889> during<00:01:38.889> the<00:01:38.979> race<00:01:39.159> when<00:01:39.609> the<00:01:39.759> tires

00:01:40.080 --> 00:01:40.090 
so as as during the race when the tires

00:01:40.090 --> 00:01:44.099 
so as as during the race when the tires
get<00:01:40.270> hold<00:01:40.659> we<00:01:41.530> need<00:01:41.709> to<00:01:41.920> increase<00:01:43.109> the

00:01:44.099 --> 00:01:44.109 
get hold we need to increase the

00:01:44.109 --> 00:01:46.709 
get hold we need to increase the
traction<00:01:44.560> control<00:01:44.770> because<00:01:45.520> then<00:01:45.969> otherwise

00:01:46.709 --> 00:01:46.719 
traction control because then otherwise

00:01:46.719 --> 00:01:48.269 
traction control because then otherwise
there<00:01:46.990> is<00:01:47.109> too<00:01:47.229> much<00:01:47.350> wisping<00:01:47.829> and<00:01:48.009> too<00:01:48.130> much

00:01:48.269 --> 00:01:48.279 
there is too much wisping and too much

00:01:48.279 --> 00:01:58.170 
there is too much wisping and too much
wear<00:01:48.999> of<00:01:49.179> from<00:01:49.630> the<00:01:49.749> tires
