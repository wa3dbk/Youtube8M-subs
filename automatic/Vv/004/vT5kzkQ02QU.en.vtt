00:05:04.100 --> 00:05:04.110 
tractor the force kept the right on top

00:05:04.110 --> 00:05:07.550 
tractor the force kept the right on top
of<00:05:04.140> it<00:05:04.380> it's<00:05:05.510> much<00:05:06.510> lower<00:05:06.750> Tower<00:05:07.020> of<00:05:07.170> machines

00:05:07.550 --> 00:05:07.560 
of it it's much lower Tower of machines

00:05:07.560 --> 00:05:10.060 
of it it's much lower Tower of machines
which<00:05:08.520> it<00:05:08.670> was<00:05:08.790> a<00:05:08.820> lot<00:05:09.030> more<00:05:09.060> wear<00:05:09.420> in<00:05:09.630> them<00:05:09.750> but

00:05:10.060 --> 00:05:10.070 
which it was a lot more wear in them but

00:05:10.070 --> 00:05:14.080 
which it was a lot more wear in them but
this<00:05:11.070> one<00:05:11.280> really<00:05:11.550> is<00:05:12.260> titers<00:05:13.260> of<00:05:13.350> drum<00:05:13.590> and

00:05:14.080 --> 00:05:14.090 
this one really is titers of drum and

00:05:14.090 --> 00:05:17.960 
this one really is titers of drum and
the<00:05:15.090> engine<00:05:15.450> pulls<00:05:15.690> very<00:05:15.810> hard<00:05:16.520> very<00:05:17.520> sweet

00:05:17.960 --> 00:05:17.970 
the engine pulls very hard very sweet

00:05:17.970 --> 00:05:19.850 
the engine pulls very hard very sweet
sounds<00:05:18.780> like<00:05:18.900> it<00:05:19.050> did<00:05:19.230> when<00:05:19.320> it<00:05:19.440> was<00:05:19.530> new<00:05:19.680> and

00:05:19.850 --> 00:05:19.860 
sounds like it did when it was new and

00:05:19.860 --> 00:05:22.070 
sounds like it did when it was new and
young<00:05:20.190> so<00:05:21.000> the<00:05:21.120> merchant<00:05:21.270> at<00:05:21.510> some<00:05:21.690> point<00:05:21.930> just

00:05:22.070 --> 00:05:22.080 
young so the merchant at some point just

00:05:22.080 --> 00:05:25.220 
young so the merchant at some point just
had<00:05:22.200> a<00:05:22.230> refresh<00:05:22.710> and<00:05:23.780> nothing<00:05:24.780> to<00:05:24.870> prove<00:05:25.050> that

cheap<00:06:34.590> and<00:06:36.560> as<00:06:37.560> I<00:06:37.680> said<00:06:37.860> they're<00:06:38.250> pretty<00:06:38.700> much

00:06:38.870 --> 00:06:38.880 
cheap and as I said they're pretty much

00:06:38.880 --> 00:06:41.390 
cheap and as I said they're pretty much
bulletproof<00:06:39.530> very<00:06:40.530> very<00:06:40.830> few<00:06:41.070> problems<00:06:41.220> with

00:06:45.680 --> 00:06:45.690 
these machines virtually zero in terms

00:06:45.690 --> 00:06:47.530 
these machines virtually zero in terms
of<00:06:45.840> the<00:06:45.930> way<00:06:46.020> of<00:06:46.200> electrics<00:06:46.650> on<00:06:46.770> the<00:06:46.890> tractors

00:06:47.530 --> 00:06:47.540 
of the way of electrics on the tractors

00:06:47.540 --> 00:06:49.640 
of the way of electrics on the tractors
which<00:06:48.540> is<00:06:48.690> what<00:06:48.840> it<00:06:48.930> should<00:06:48.960> be<00:06:49.140> on<00:06:49.320> machines

00:06:49.640 --> 00:06:49.650 
which is what it should be on machines

00:06:49.650 --> 00:06:51.230 
which is what it should be on machines
unfortunately<00:06:50.280> they're<00:06:50.940> getting<00:06:51.150> quite

00:06:51.230 --> 00:06:51.240 
unfortunately they're getting quite
