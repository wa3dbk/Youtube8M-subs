whatever like that so I usually have

00:01:31.460 --> 00:01:33.700 
whatever like that so I usually have

00:01:33.700 --> 00:01:33.710 
about a serving and a half of this I do

00:01:33.710 --> 00:01:36.160 
about a serving and a half of this I do
measure<00:01:34.189> it<00:01:34.429> out<00:01:34.549> on<00:01:34.700> the<00:01:34.789> scale<00:01:35.119> you<00:01:35.479> know<00:01:35.869> San

00:01:36.160 --> 00:01:36.170 
measure it out on the scale you know San

00:01:36.170 --> 00:01:38.260 
measure it out on the scale you know San
so<00:01:36.350> it<00:01:36.439> equals<00:01:36.590> out<00:01:36.920> to<00:01:36.979> be<00:01:37.280> about<00:01:37.399> maybe<00:01:37.909> I

00:01:38.260 --> 00:01:38.270 
so it equals out to be about maybe I

00:01:38.270 --> 00:01:41.080

protein right there were down for the

00:03:09.890 --> 00:03:13.210 
protein right there were down for the
water<00:03:10.240> as<00:03:11.240> well<00:03:11.600> I<00:03:11.990> put<00:03:12.230> some<00:03:12.410> baby<00:03:12.680> spinach<00:03:12.860> in
