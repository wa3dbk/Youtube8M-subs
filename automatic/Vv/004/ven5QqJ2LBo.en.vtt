00:00:09.630 --> 00:00:12.600
 Boy was it him everyone hope 

00:00:11.550 --> 00:00:13.830
 that they all go well then 

00:00:12.600 --> 00:00:15.719
 today we find ourselves for a small 

00:00:13.830 --> 00:00:18.540
 geek does nothing to do so that's how 

00:00:15.719 --> 00:00:20.400
 unlock caps and unique 

00:00:18.540 --> 00:00:21.990
 north bandas for your character so 

00:00:20.400 --> 00:00:24.750
 invite you all to leave a little crazy 

00:00:21.990 --> 00:00:26.279
 this a comment and subscribe to this 

00:00:24.750 --> 00:00:29.700
 did not happen and we're going right now 

00:00:26.279 --> 00:00:31.919
 started so to unlock these 

00:00:29.700 --> 00:00:34.470
 elements you will have to be equipped with 

00:00:31.919 --> 00:00:36.870
 turning masks those who are 

00:00:34.470 --> 00:00:43.980
 equipped so two glasses caps 

00:00:36.870 --> 00:00:47.580
 and game bandanas m that's what there is 

00:00:43.980 --> 00:00:49.350
 several colors could make a 

00:00:47.580 --> 00:00:51.870
 choice so I'm going to do with the purple 

00:00:49.350 --> 00:00:56.660
 so here I am going to show you how 

00:00:51.870 --> 00:00:59.370
 remove the bandanna already 

00:00:56.660 --> 00:01:02.550
 so for that you will need a car 

00:00:59.370 --> 00:01:03.750
 you simply go up inside 

00:01:02.550 --> 00:01:06.390
 of the car 

00:01:03.750 --> 00:01:09.920
 there you take out the inventory and you 

00:01:06.390 --> 00:01:09.920
 so go change pairs of glasses 

00:01:11.070 --> 00:01:14.159
 and a session of exchanged pairs of 

00:01:12.330 --> 00:01:17.159
 glasses you can close the inventory 

00:01:14.159 --> 00:01:19.560
 and come out there so you'll have more the 

00:01:17.159 --> 00:01:21.660
 bandanas and he would have unlocked 

00:01:19.560 --> 00:01:26.360
 so the cap that is not 

00:01:21.660 --> 00:01:28.590
 available for sale from the net 

00:01:26.360 --> 00:01:30.690
 and you will see that the caps 

00:01:28.590 --> 00:01:31.280
 to are really pity that those who are 

00:01:30.690 --> 00:01:33.930
 on sale 

00:01:31.280 --> 00:01:36.540
 so there you will be more than 

00:01:33.930 --> 00:01:39.530
 save the outfit as well 

00:01:36.540 --> 00:01:39.530
 avoid repeating the pitch 

00:01:39.610 --> 00:01:43.270
 and now we are going to move to the 

00:01:41.350 --> 00:01:45.580
 second part of the glitch alone which is going 

00:01:43.270 --> 00:01:47.340
 not allow the cap to be removed and 

00:01:45.580 --> 00:01:51.390
 keep the bandanna 

00:01:47.340 --> 00:01:54.040
 first we will put the mask back 

00:01:51.390 --> 00:01:56.310
 with the cap and glasses and the 

00:01:54.040 --> 00:01:56.310
 bandana 

00:01:57.260 --> 00:02:02.950
 and first you'll just need to 

00:01:58.910 --> 00:02:02.950
 head to the hats 

00:02:06.380 --> 00:02:10.880
 there you will only have to select 

00:02:07.759 --> 00:02:15.319
 a style of hat and put no 

00:02:10.880 --> 00:02:18.940
 hat and that's it just you 

00:02:15.319 --> 00:02:21.380
 will have that bandanna and not the cap 

00:02:18.940 --> 00:02:24.290
 it's a very simple glitch and 

00:02:21.380 --> 00:02:26.599
 who makes your character so does he 

00:02:24.290 --> 00:02:29.599
 then you can save the outfit 

00:02:26.599 --> 00:02:33.430
 so to avoid similar to redo the 

00:02:29.599 --> 00:02:36.050
 cleach and benefit from it later 

00:02:33.430 --> 00:02:37.880
 here I hope that this church I you 

00:02:36.050 --> 00:02:41.690
 will have pleased if these cases do not hesitate to 

00:02:37.880 --> 00:02:44.480
 leave a little thumb a comment and 

00:02:41.690 --> 00:02:46.690
 to subscribe this is not done and has 

00:02:44.480 --> 00:02:46.690
 more
