00:00:13.950 --> 00:00:18.960
 Another Zombie Gameplay Crack 

00:00:16.109 --> 00:00:21.150
 this time on the black ops an ascension map 

00:00:18.960 --> 00:00:22.650
 For you that is not on, I'm 

00:00:21.150 --> 00:00:24.630
 participating in one more race and 

00:00:22.650 --> 00:00:26.369
 looking for a record of that map 

00:00:24.630 --> 00:00:29.340
 Are you seeing in an excerpt in the round? 

00:00:26.369 --> 00:00:30.810
 108 background and people today's video 

00:00:29.340 --> 00:00:32.250
 It will be a very short video as well. 

00:00:30.810 --> 00:00:34.559
 I'll quickly try to release it soon. 

00:00:32.250 --> 00:00:36.059
 in this Saturday night's almost ten 

00:00:34.559 --> 00:00:38.250
 hours and everyone has actually passed the 

00:00:36.059 --> 00:00:39.930
 10 hours autographing the video here 

00:00:38.250 --> 00:00:41.730
 which just want to upgrade to 

00:00:39.930 --> 00:00:43.770
 You bring an update about it. 

00:00:41.730 --> 00:00:45.420
 this race and kill the longing too 

00:00:43.770 --> 00:00:47.730
 You have a few days that I do not 

00:00:45.420 --> 00:00:49.500
 a video I've just arrived at little case and 

00:00:47.730 --> 00:00:51.719
 has a little bit and missed the 

00:00:49.500 --> 00:00:53.430
 The norm to have a chat with you 

00:00:51.719 --> 00:00:55.170
 so i decided to make this rapid video only 

00:00:53.430 --> 00:00:57.090
 to give a hello gives an air of grace 

00:00:55.170 --> 00:00:58.469
 today still monday we will be back 

00:00:57.090 --> 00:00:59.910
 to normal with the channel there 

00:00:58.469 --> 00:01:02.340
 remembering the weekend usually 

00:00:59.910 --> 00:01:04.290
 I do not do good videos. 

00:01:02.340 --> 00:01:05.760
 about the race now just remembering 

00:01:04.290 --> 00:01:07.799
 You're the reason you 're doing this. 

00:01:05.760 --> 00:01:09.689
 running at that moment is that there is one or 

00:01:07.799 --> 00:01:12.210
 two weeks ago more or less people 

00:01:09.689 --> 00:01:14.220
 had a huge race for the round without 

00:01:12.210 --> 00:01:17.040
 here on this map was organized by 

00:01:14.220 --> 00:01:18.900
 natan and involved a huge range 

00:01:17.040 --> 00:01:20.460
 number of people in the 

00:01:18.900 --> 00:01:22.140
 some men in october some 

00:01:20.460 --> 00:01:23.900
 subscribed then telecel link from 

00:01:22.140 --> 00:01:26.729
 community at your discretion 

00:01:23.900 --> 00:01:28.590
 participate and get more involved and there 

00:01:26.729 --> 00:01:30.420
 had an obvious crowd that already arrived at 

00:01:28.590 --> 00:01:32.850
 round I do not even remember now to tell you 

00:01:30.420 --> 00:01:35.009
 to the right 30 and the der will look for the name 

00:01:32.850 --> 00:01:37.950
 of the person I leave there in the discretion 

00:01:35.009 --> 00:01:39.630
 For you guys who obviously got 

00:01:37.950 --> 00:01:41.729
 round without first is the goal of the 

00:01:39.630 --> 00:01:43.950
 race and there's a gal that solved 

00:01:41.729 --> 00:01:46.140
 keep playing what I had 

00:01:43.950 --> 00:01:48.090
 committed to staff was that I was going to 

00:01:46.140 --> 00:01:50.399
 try to seek and try to beat the record 

00:01:48.090 --> 00:01:52.170
 Of who keeps playing I would not go 

00:01:50.399 --> 00:01:54.149
 participate in the race until the round without 

00:01:52.170 --> 00:01:56.490
 but then I would pick up and resume the 

00:01:54.149 --> 00:01:59.189
 record since it has already happened to me 

00:01:56.490 --> 00:02:02.520
 until the last update I made 

00:01:59.189 --> 00:02:04.829
 was in round 145 the boy had stopped 

00:02:02.520 --> 00:02:06.450
 But you're not mistaken, luiz pirata. 

00:02:04.829 --> 00:02:07.210
 still playing inspired was a 

00:02:06.450 --> 00:02:11.740
 crazy that 

00:02:07.210 --> 00:02:14.080
 arrived in the hand of a hundred and few in 1965 

00:02:11.740 --> 00:02:16.569
 diagonally that even in this map he 

00:02:14.080 --> 00:02:19.240
 today they told me that they are in the 151 

00:02:16.569 --> 00:02:21.730
 caused in the good 151 he is enough 

00:02:19.240 --> 00:02:24.910
 patient who actually reaches 850 

00:02:21.730 --> 00:02:26.530
 you need a lot of patience and he's 

00:02:24.910 --> 00:02:27.130
 It seems to be going well without giving 

00:02:26.530 --> 00:02:28.540
 one 

00:02:27.130 --> 00:02:30.330
 Let's see he looks like he 's going to 

00:02:28.540 --> 00:02:32.650
 set a very high record and 

00:02:30.330 --> 00:02:34.690
 I believe that I must be running after 

00:02:32.650 --> 00:02:38.860
 of the world record if I 'm not mistaken 

00:02:34.690 --> 00:02:41.470
 on this map it's still 186 and there you remember it 

00:02:38.860 --> 00:02:45.340
 general of the black ops where it has already passed 200 I 

00:02:41.470 --> 00:02:46.780
 thought he was 195 but not sure 

00:02:45.340 --> 00:02:48.910
 I talked to the people these days. 

00:02:46.780 --> 00:02:52.330
 I got the impression of 200 in the head 

00:02:48.910 --> 00:02:54.370
 It 's tall, does not it matter? 

00:02:52.330 --> 00:02:56.350
 today the right number in a forthcoming 

00:02:54.370 --> 00:02:59.680
 update I bring you but I 

00:02:56.350 --> 00:03:01.450
 I believe that on this map 186 in general 195 

00:02:59.680 --> 00:03:03.459
 And I believe Luis is with 

00:03:01.450 --> 00:03:05.290
 It looks like he gets there. 

00:03:03.459 --> 00:03:06.610
 apparently with patience if you do not have 

00:03:05.290 --> 00:03:07.930
 no give because it is still playing with 

00:03:06.610 --> 00:03:10.300
 patience playing slowly 

00:03:07.930 --> 00:03:13.209
 it seems like it goes there on the gameplay 

00:03:10.300 --> 00:03:14.620
 108 and the optimization that I 

00:03:13.209 --> 00:03:18.459
 had happened to you 

00:03:14.620 --> 00:03:21.299
 had been 75 76 if I'm not mistaken and there 

00:03:18.459 --> 00:03:25.239
 I've had one of the rounds there and there 

00:03:21.299 --> 00:03:27.850
 79 and there was a moby vacillus will still be 

00:03:25.239 --> 00:03:30.370
 Larger because I competed I bought all 

00:03:27.850 --> 00:03:32.739
 my few during the round are still 

00:03:30.370 --> 00:03:34.810
 on the round-up turn of monkey 

00:03:32.739 --> 00:03:36.130
 I ended up losing one of the pots again 

00:03:34.810 --> 00:03:38.320
 finally this happens 

00:03:36.130 --> 00:03:40.600
 this was the least important 

00:03:38.320 --> 00:03:43.450
 gameplay because I ended up giving mole falling 

00:03:40.600 --> 00:03:45.280
 round 108 and then right after that 

00:03:43.450 --> 00:03:48.340
 I killed myself, I closed the gameplay. 

00:03:45.280 --> 00:03:50.019
 I fell right down here near the 

00:03:48.340 --> 00:03:51.730
 pec to band from his pre- campaign area 

00:03:50.019 --> 00:03:53.920
 of the missile of a vacillus falling there 

00:03:51.730 --> 00:03:55.840
 and then the idiot decided to go through the strike 

00:03:53.920 --> 00:03:57.910
 of 100 fire because none I had 

00:03:55.840 --> 00:04:00.040
 completely forgotten was given to 

00:03:57.910 --> 00:04:01.750
 or not I was still halfway through the 

00:04:00.040 --> 00:04:03.430
 I 'm telling you, I 'm telling you that I 

00:04:01.750 --> 00:04:05.620
 I do not remember, I did record this 

00:04:03.430 --> 00:04:09.010
 Boy, if I recorded, will this be? 

00:04:05.620 --> 00:04:10.600
 involved will see but anyway I 

00:04:09.010 --> 00:04:12.820
 I was kind of in doubt wondering if I 

00:04:10.600 --> 00:04:15.730
 passed or not and I decided last time 

00:04:12.820 --> 00:04:16.389
 time to pass and I ended up 

00:04:15.730 --> 00:04:17.949
 gameplay 

00:04:16.389 --> 00:04:19.840
 It's obvious that I did not give up. 

00:04:17.949 --> 00:04:20.620
 would be bringing updating to you 

00:04:19.840 --> 00:04:22.330
 I have 

00:04:20.620 --> 00:04:24.610
 I took the race, I'm going to play a little bit 

00:04:22.330 --> 00:04:26.979
 today now the night of Saturday 30 and 

00:04:24.610 --> 00:04:28.810
 Little if I 'm not mistaken, I'll play one. 

00:04:26.979 --> 00:04:30.760
 a little bit Saturday night and I'm going 

00:04:28.810 --> 00:04:32.440
 see if it catches enough on Sunday of the race 

00:04:30.760 --> 00:04:34.690
 on Sunday night you get in the round without 

00:04:32.440 --> 00:04:35.919
 good playing quiet with this new 

00:04:34.690 --> 00:04:38.110
 strategy I 'm using 

00:04:35.919 --> 00:04:40.270
 I can not guarantee if I will have time if 

00:04:38.110 --> 00:04:41.949
 I'll have the patience to play but it's mine. 

00:04:40.270 --> 00:04:44.560
 objective and I will keep you updated 

00:04:41.949 --> 00:04:46.030
 For twitter, maybe I can not do it. 

00:04:44.560 --> 00:04:47.650
 a video tomorrow if you should create a video 

00:04:46.030 --> 00:04:49.360
 tomorrow still saying that round I quit 

00:04:47.650 --> 00:04:51.520
 but anyway 

00:04:49.360 --> 00:04:52.870
 stay tuned to twitter will have resumed 

00:04:51.520 --> 00:04:55.090
 stay up to date 

00:04:52.870 --> 00:04:56.949
 this time I get there I wanted to know there 

00:04:55.090 --> 00:04:59.020
 that the truth I wanted to wait for 

00:04:56.949 --> 00:05:00.639
 know in which round pirate luiz will stop 

00:04:59.020 --> 00:05:03.130
 for I knew how far I want to go 

00:05:00.639 --> 00:05:05.860
 in principle today my goal is to resume 

00:05:03.130 --> 00:05:07.690
 the Brazilian record but depending on 

00:05:05.860 --> 00:05:08.289
 which place fell part straight to the 

00:05:07.690 --> 00:05:09.970
 world 

00:05:08.289 --> 00:05:12.789
 or I'll stay here for Brazilian rap 

00:05:09.970 --> 00:05:13.960
 even if it suddenly stops until the 160 

00:05:12.789 --> 00:05:16.120
 More or less I do not know if I'll have 

00:05:13.960 --> 00:05:17.440
 I'll stay there if I get to 

00:05:16.120 --> 00:05:20.440
 that's because I have not arrived yet 

00:05:17.440 --> 00:05:21.820
 remembering my record and 136 but let's 

00:05:20.440 --> 00:05:24.130
 There guys, I'm convinced this time. 

00:05:21.820 --> 00:05:26.470
 playing this strategy calmly is a 

00:05:24.130 --> 00:05:28.419
 little faster than used before 

00:05:26.470 --> 00:05:30.639
 a little better and is as safe as 

00:05:28.419 --> 00:05:31.930
 so you end up playing more calmly with 

00:05:30.639 --> 00:05:33.220
 a little more patience 

00:05:31.930 --> 00:05:35.229
 I 'll already make a video explaining 

00:05:33.220 --> 00:05:36.820
 I detail the details of this strategy 

00:05:35.229 --> 00:05:38.200
 but what you see in the video 

00:05:36.820 --> 00:05:39.789
 It's nothing much different from what I'm going 

00:05:38.200 --> 00:05:41.380
 Talk to you, not if you have to 

00:05:39.789 --> 00:05:43.660
 attention to one detail or another 

00:05:41.380 --> 00:05:45.370
 already the spirit for you good to win in the 

00:05:43.660 --> 00:05:47.680
 video of today here I'll ask 

00:05:45.370 --> 00:05:49.539
 you evaluate the video and leave a 

00:05:47.680 --> 00:05:51.550
 comment and sign up for the channel if 

00:05:49.539 --> 00:05:55.349
 you have not registered yet I'll see you in the 

00:05:51.550 --> 00:05:55.349
 Next video a hug
