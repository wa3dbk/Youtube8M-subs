00:01:03.920 --> 00:01:03.930 
well let me let me just say that if i

00:01:03.930 --> 00:01:07.270 
well let me let me just say that if i
had<00:01:04.199> the<00:01:04.229> same<00:01:04.379> mindset<00:01:05.159> i<00:01:05.549> did<00:01:05.820> in<00:01:06.080> 2006

00:01:07.270 --> 00:01:07.280 
had the same mindset i did in 2006

00:01:07.280 --> 00:01:11.660 
had the same mindset i did in 2006
basically<00:01:08.280> when<00:01:08.580> I<00:01:08.610> had<00:01:08.700> the<00:01:08.880> surgery<00:01:09.240> done

00:01:11.660 --> 00:01:11.670

yeah<00:01:12.299> I<00:01:12.479> would<00:01:12.689> have<00:01:12.840> the<00:01:12.990> surgery<00:01:13.409> down<00:01:13.650> again

00:01:13.940 --> 00:01:13.950 
yeah I would have the surgery down again

00:01:13.950 --> 00:01:15.550 
yeah I would have the surgery down again
because

00:01:15.550 --> 00:01:15.560 
because

00:01:15.560 --> 00:01:18.820 
because
I<00:01:15.729> feel<00:01:16.729> like

00:01:18.820 --> 00:01:18.830 
I feel like

00:01:18.830 --> 00:01:21.970 
I feel like
at<00:01:19.340> that<00:01:19.700> time<00:01:20.000> I<00:01:20.360> was<00:01:20.390> already<00:01:20.960> defeated<00:01:21.440> and

at that time I was already defeated and

00:01:21.980 --> 00:01:23.800 
at that time I was already defeated and
I<00:01:22.190> really<00:01:22.490> didn't<00:01:22.700> have<00:01:22.850> that<00:01:22.910> education<00:01:23.720> I

00:01:23.800 --> 00:01:23.810 
I really didn't have that education I

00:01:23.810 --> 00:01:28.030 
I really didn't have that education I
needed<00:01:24.140> to<00:01:25.570> get<00:01:26.570> rid<00:01:26.630> of<00:01:26.870> the<00:01:27.020> weight<00:01:27.230> and<00:01:27.530> get

00:01:28.030 --> 00:01:28.040 
needed to get rid of the weight and get

00:01:28.040 --> 00:01:30.520 
needed to get rid of the weight and get
on<00:01:28.130> track<00:01:28.520> and<00:01:28.880> every<00:01:29.390> time<00:01:29.870> that<00:01:29.930> I<00:01:30.200> had

00:01:30.520 --> 00:01:30.530 
on track and every time that I had

00:01:30.530 --> 00:01:33.700 
on track and every time that I had
attempted<00:01:30.890> to<00:01:31.130> do<00:01:31.430> so<00:01:31.730> I<00:01:32.030> failed<00:01:32.570> or<00:01:33.320> I<00:01:33.350> stopped

00:01:33.700 --> 00:01:33.710 
attempted to do so I failed or I stopped

00:01:33.710 --> 00:01:35.830 
attempted to do so I failed or I stopped
short<00:01:34.070> before<00:01:34.280> my<00:01:34.610> goal<00:01:34.820> all<00:01:35.000> right<00:01:35.120> sabotage

00:01:37.990 --> 00:01:38.000 
myself and I just really did not

00:01:38.000 --> 00:01:41.020 
myself and I just really did not
understand<00:01:38.600> myself<00:01:38.840> completely<00:01:39.520> so<00:01:40.520> if<00:01:40.700> I

00:01:41.020 --> 00:01:41.030 
understand myself completely so if I

00:01:41.030 --> 00:01:43.930

00:01:45.430 --> 00:01:45.440 
would have the surgery again because i

00:01:45.440 --> 00:01:48.100

00:01:48.100 --> 00:01:48.110 
feel like the surgery helped me to

00:01:48.110 --> 00:01:51.250 
feel like the surgery helped me to
really<00:01:48.350> find<00:01:49.180> the<00:01:50.180> real<00:01:50.480> April<00:01:50.720> and<00:01:51.170> the

not to say that having this surgery is a
complete<00:02:20.930> easy<00:02:21.140> way<00:02:21.410> because<00:02:21.860> it<00:02:22.160> hasn't<00:02:22.400> been

00:02:22.890 --> 00:02:22.900 
complete easy way because it hasn't been

00:02:22.900 --> 00:02:27.250

my body now I think I think that I can
safely<00:03:14.840> say<00:03:15.290> i<00:03:15.980> mean<00:03:16.159> i<00:03:16.250> don't<00:03:16.430> want<00:03:16.579> to<00:03:16.640> come

safely say i mean i don't want to come

00:03:16.790 --> 00:03:19.479 
safely say i mean i don't want to come
off<00:03:16.849> as<00:03:16.909> cocky<00:03:17.299> but<00:03:18.010> even<00:03:19.010> though<00:03:19.189> it's

00:03:19.479 --> 00:03:19.489 
off as cocky but even though it's

00:03:19.489 --> 00:03:23.770 
off as cocky but even though it's
possible<00:03:20.260> that<00:03:21.260> i<00:03:22.040> could<00:03:22.609> start<00:03:23.480> i<00:03:23.540> have<00:03:23.659> to

00:03:23.770 --> 00:03:23.780 
possible that i could start i have to

00:03:23.780 --> 00:03:27.550 
possible that i could start i have to
use<00:03:24.319> my<00:03:24.500> turning<00:03:24.829> signal<00:03:25.159> here<00:03:26.409> it<00:03:27.409> is

00:03:27.550 --> 00:03:27.560 
use my turning signal here it is

00:03:27.560 --> 00:03:29.319 
use my turning signal here it is
completely<00:03:27.920> possible<00:03:28.219> that<00:03:28.760> i<00:03:28.909> could<00:03:28.939> put<00:03:29.239> on

00:03:29.319 --> 00:03:29.329 
completely possible that i could put on

00:03:29.329 --> 00:03:33.650 
completely possible that i could put on
weight<00:03:29.599> and<00:03:31.329> you<00:03:32.329> know

00:03:33.650 --> 00:03:33.660 
weight and you know

00:03:33.660 --> 00:03:35.690 
weight and you know
gain<00:03:34.290> a<00:03:34.370> substantial<00:03:35.370> amount<00:03:35.460> of<00:03:35.640> weight

00:03:35.690 --> 00:03:35.700 
gain a substantial amount of weight

00:03:35.700 --> 00:03:40.160 
gain a substantial amount of weight
again<00:03:37.070> but<00:03:38.070> I<00:03:38.490> really<00:03:39.120> feel<00:03:39.390> confident<00:03:39.870> in<00:03:40.020> the

00:03:40.160 --> 00:03:40.170 
again but I really feel confident in the

00:03:40.170 --> 00:03:41.890 
again but I really feel confident in the
fact<00:03:40.350> that<00:03:40.530> I<00:03:40.770> would<00:03:41.070> not<00:03:41.190> let<00:03:41.430> that<00:03:41.460> happen

00:03:41.890 --> 00:03:41.900 
fact that I would not let that happen

00:03:41.900 --> 00:03:46.160 
fact that I would not let that happen
because<00:03:42.900> I<00:03:44.300> understand<00:03:45.300> things<00:03:45.690> that<00:03:45.870> I<00:03:45.900> never

00:03:46.160 --> 00:03:46.170 
because I understand things that I never

00:03:46.170 --> 00:03:48.650 
because I understand things that I never
understood<00:03:46.260> before<00:03:47.010> just<00:03:47.940> like<00:03:48.150> you<00:03:48.330> know<00:03:48.450> how

00:03:48.650 --> 00:03:48.660 
understood before just like you know how

00:03:48.660 --> 00:03:52.610 
understood before just like you know how
much<00:03:48.840> i<00:03:49.170> can<00:03:49.560> truly<00:03:49.860> eat<00:03:50.600> what<00:03:51.600> i<00:03:51.810> have<00:03:52.170> to<00:03:52.380> do

00:03:52.610 --> 00:03:52.620 
much i can truly eat what i have to do

00:03:52.620 --> 00:03:55.550 
much i can truly eat what i have to do
and<00:03:53.160> my<00:03:53.670> real<00:03:53.910> problem<00:03:54.180> i<00:03:54.570> think<00:03:54.870> before<00:03:55.320> was

00:03:55.550 --> 00:03:55.560 
and my real problem i think before was

00:03:55.560 --> 00:03:57.590 
and my real problem i think before was
the<00:03:55.710> fact<00:03:55.920> that<00:03:56.070> I<00:03:56.370> didn't<00:03:56.700> move<00:03:56.910> enough<00:03:57.300> I

00:03:57.590 --> 00:03:57.600 
the fact that I didn't move enough I

00:03:57.600 --> 00:04:00.290 
the fact that I didn't move enough I
mean<00:03:58.440> it<00:03:58.590> really<00:03:58.620> came<00:03:59.130> down<00:03:59.190> to<00:03:59.430> not<00:03:59.940> getting

00:04:00.290 --> 00:04:00.300 
mean it really came down to not getting

00:04:00.300 --> 00:04:02.930 
mean it really came down to not getting
the<00:04:00.390> proper<00:04:00.540> exercise<00:04:01.170> that<00:04:01.830> my<00:04:02.280> body<00:04:02.580> needed
