00:00:17.810 --> 00:00:17.820 
times I'm worried about what if the

00:00:17.820 --> 00:00:19.490 
times I'm worried about what if the
computer<00:00:18.270> has<00:00:18.390> some<00:00:18.570> problems<00:00:19.140> after<00:00:19.410> the

00:00:29.900 --> 00:00:29.910 
kind of a larger question not just Apple

00:00:29.910 --> 00:00:31.460 
kind of a larger question not just Apple
but<00:00:30.300> statistically<00:00:30.869> I<00:00:31.019> have<00:00:31.109> to<00:00:31.199> say<00:00:31.320> for

00:00:31.460 --> 00:00:31.470 
but statistically I have to say for

00:00:31.470 --> 00:00:33.229 
but statistically I have to say for
almost<00:00:31.740> any<00:00:32.070> brand<00:00:32.340> of<00:00:32.489> notebook<00:00:32.790> you're<00:00:32.969> way

00:00:33.229 --> 00:00:33.239 
almost any brand of notebook you're way

00:00:33.239 --> 00:00:34.790 
almost any brand of notebook you're way
off<00:00:33.420> the<00:00:33.570> chart<00:00:33.780> for<00:00:33.989> repairs<00:00:34.320> and<00:00:34.559> that

00:00:34.790 --> 00:00:34.800 
off the chart for repairs and that

00:00:34.800 --> 00:00:36.799 
off the chart for repairs and that
really<00:00:35.280> sucks<00:00:35.579> yeah<00:00:35.910> it's<00:00:36.390> just<00:00:36.510> it<00:00:36.750> just

00:00:36.799 --> 00:00:36.809 
really sucks yeah it's just it just

00:00:36.809 --> 00:00:38.930 
really sucks yeah it's just it just
stinks<00:00:37.230> when<00:00:37.350> you<00:00:37.440> get<00:00:37.590> kind<00:00:37.770> of<00:00:37.800> a<00:00:37.890> dud<00:00:38.160> yeah

00:00:38.930 --> 00:00:38.940 
stinks when you get kind of a dud yeah

00:00:38.940 --> 00:00:40.430 
stinks when you get kind of a dud yeah
you<00:00:39.180> know<00:00:39.300> when<00:00:39.480> you<00:00:39.570> get<00:00:39.899> something<00:00:40.110> home

00:00:40.430 --> 00:00:40.440 
you know when you get something home

00:00:40.440 --> 00:00:42.650 
you know when you get something home
that<00:00:40.469> you've<00:00:41.040> spent<00:00:41.399> a<00:00:41.520> lot<00:00:41.700> of<00:00:41.730> money<00:00:42.030> on<00:00:42.270> and

00:00:42.650 --> 00:00:42.660 
that you've spent a lot of money on and

00:00:42.660 --> 00:00:43.970 
that you've spent a lot of money on and
then<00:00:42.750> things<00:00:43.020> just<00:00:43.079> aren't<00:00:43.410> working<00:00:43.530> the<00:00:43.890> way

00:00:43.970 --> 00:00:43.980 
then things just aren't working the way

00:00:43.980 --> 00:00:46.520 
then things just aren't working the way
they<00:00:44.160> were<00:00:44.219> supposed<00:00:44.640> to<00:00:44.730> it's<00:00:45.000> like<00:00:45.180> ah<00:00:45.530> that

00:00:46.520 --> 00:00:46.530 
they were supposed to it's like ah that

00:00:46.530 --> 00:00:48.529 
they were supposed to it's like ah that
would<00:00:46.590> be<00:00:46.649> bad<00:00:46.980> the<00:00:47.760> classic<00:00:48.149> Consumer

extended warranty usually cost as much
as<00:00:52.590> replacing<00:00:53.100> the<00:00:53.340> device<00:00:53.699> by<00:00:54.030> the<00:00:54.059> time<00:00:54.329> it

but<00:00:58.350> the<00:00:58.440> advice<00:00:58.710> is<00:00:58.949> still<00:00:59.160> generally<00:00:59.670> that

00:01:00.139 --> 00:01:00.149 
but the advice is still generally that

00:01:00.149 --> 00:01:01.849 
but the advice is still generally that
you<00:01:00.300> don't<00:01:00.570> need<00:01:00.840> it<00:01:01.020> because<00:01:01.170> most<00:01:01.410> consumer

00:01:01.849 --> 00:01:01.859 
you don't need it because most consumer

breakdowns on consumer electronics

00:01:03.239 --> 00:01:05.030 
breakdowns on consumer electronics
happen<00:01:03.539> very<00:01:03.719> early<00:01:03.870> on<00:01:04.140> in<00:01:04.470> the<00:01:04.530> first<00:01:04.710> year

00:01:05.030 --> 00:01:05.040 
happen very early on in the first year

00:01:05.040 --> 00:01:07.580 
happen very early on in the first year
if<00:01:05.129> not<00:01:05.189> the<00:01:05.369> first<00:01:05.580> few<00:01:05.909> hours<00:01:06.320> usually<00:01:07.320> if

00:01:07.580 --> 00:01:07.590 
if not the first few hours usually if

00:01:07.590 --> 00:01:08.810 
if not the first few hours usually if
something<00:01:07.890> doesn't<00:01:08.040> break<00:01:08.340> in<00:01:08.490> the<00:01:08.580> first<00:01:08.700> 48

something doesn't break in the first 48

00:01:08.820 --> 00:01:10.730 
something doesn't break in the first 48
hours<00:01:09.540> it's<00:01:09.689> probably<00:01:10.110> good<00:01:10.260> to<00:01:10.380> go<00:01:10.500> halfway

00:01:10.730 --> 00:01:10.740

so much but Apple for one is actually

really good on power supply returns I

00:01:19.020 --> 00:01:20.690 
really good on power supply returns I
think<00:01:19.200> because<00:01:19.500> MagSafe<00:01:20.040> power<00:01:20.070> suppliers

00:01:20.690 --> 00:01:20.700 
think because MagSafe power suppliers

00:01:20.700 --> 00:01:22.820 
think because MagSafe power suppliers
tend<00:01:20.970> to<00:01:21.060> disintegrate<00:01:21.330> over<00:01:21.630> time<00:01:22.140> they<00:01:22.799> have

00:01:22.820 --> 00:01:22.830 
tend to disintegrate over time they have

00:01:22.830 --> 00:01:24.859 
tend to disintegrate over time they have
if<00:01:23.100> they<00:01:23.220> have<00:01:23.369> a<00:01:23.400> known<00:01:23.640> bug<00:01:23.909> a<00:01:24.210> no<00:01:24.360> problem

00:01:24.859 --> 00:01:24.869 
if they have a known bug a no problem

00:01:24.869 --> 00:01:26.570 
if they have a known bug a no problem
issue<00:01:25.080> with<00:01:25.590> with<00:01:25.860> something<00:01:26.250> within<00:01:26.490> the

00:01:26.570 --> 00:01:26.580 
issue with with something within the

00:01:26.580 --> 00:01:27.830 
issue with with something within the
hardware<00:01:26.790> usually<00:01:27.299> they're<00:01:27.450> a<00:01:27.479> little<00:01:27.630> more

00:01:27.830 --> 00:01:27.840 
hardware usually they're a little more

00:01:27.840 --> 00:01:31.039 
hardware usually they're a little more
lenient<00:01:28.020> with<00:01:28.409> it<00:01:28.560> but<00:01:29.520> yeah<00:01:30.119> my<00:01:30.360> computer<00:01:30.930> has

00:01:31.039 --> 00:01:31.049 
lenient with it but yeah my computer has

00:01:31.049 --> 00:01:32.630 
lenient with it but yeah my computer has
worked<00:01:31.290> perfectly<00:01:31.680> well<00:01:31.890> over<00:01:32.159> the<00:01:32.250> past<00:01:32.430> few

00:01:32.630 --> 00:01:32.640 
worked perfectly well over the past few

00:01:32.640 --> 00:01:35.120 
worked perfectly well over the past few
years<00:01:32.729> except<00:01:33.450> for<00:01:33.479> now<00:01:33.780> the<00:01:34.259> DVD<00:01:34.860> drive

00:01:35.120 --> 00:01:35.130 
years except for now the DVD drive

00:01:35.130 --> 00:01:36.679 
years except for now the DVD drive
doesn't<00:01:35.490> work<00:01:35.610> anymore<00:01:35.909> and<00:01:36.299> I<00:01:36.450> had<00:01:36.600> to
