 I repeat this clio set weber 

00:00:58.080 --> 00:01:03.470
 that is, you can translate with us if 

00:01:00.809 --> 00:01:06.510
 it will be like the choice of weather 

00:01:03.470 --> 00:01:10.229
 we choose the weather for the best 

00:01:06.510 --> 00:01:17.220
 values fps twenty first that is we 

00:01:10.229 --> 00:01:21.120
 put a slash point so in and make a space 

00:01:17.220 --> 00:01:23.310
 and we write 21 as you see it becomes 

00:01:21.120 --> 00:01:25.620
 dark little but it sng 

00:01:23.310 --> 00:01:28.860
 I will turn off the inbi like this 

00:01:25.620 --> 00:01:33.300
 standard you gta at me now 70 

00:01:28.860 --> 00:01:36.750
 80 fps in the street and grandfathers and more cars and 

00:01:33.300 --> 00:01:39.990
 the point is that there are no clouds 

00:01:36.750 --> 00:01:43.680
 no you for the most part 

00:01:39.990 --> 00:01:49.190
 time cycle and well there you cycle is set and 

00:01:43.680 --> 00:01:52.560
 in general, the clouds they kind of slows down well 

00:01:49.190 --> 00:01:55.680
 drawing and everything in general that is vps 

00:01:52.560 --> 00:01:58.880
 added by 5 well for 520 somewhere I donâ€™t 

00:01:55.680 --> 00:02:01.640
 I know, but how are you guys 

00:01:58.880 --> 00:02:04.430
 and we can patsa and see others like 

00:02:01.640 --> 00:02:07.460
 weather let's say 50 

00:02:04.430 --> 00:02:09.140
 but this is so pure of your choice 

00:02:07.460 --> 00:02:11.450
 if you don't like driving at night 

00:02:09.140 --> 00:02:15.380
 let's say for 20 because it changes there 

00:02:11.450 --> 00:02:19.010
 the weather is there every three hours or 1 2 now 

00:02:15.380 --> 00:02:22.099
 so stop loss is generally fucking me 

00:02:19.010 --> 00:02:25.910
 precipitation is fps but so generally it is impossible to drive 

00:02:22.099 --> 00:02:30.080
 won in general, all passing clearly a200 

00:02:25.910 --> 00:02:34.489
 here's the lead too cool guys for 

00:02:30.080 --> 00:02:38.680
 someone like that is activation slash . at 

00:02:34.489 --> 00:02:43.099
 and the weather number is the best number is 21 

00:02:38.680 --> 00:02:45.019
 no clouds and your fps goes up on sai 

00:02:43.099 --> 00:02:46.250
