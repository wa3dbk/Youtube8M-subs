00:02:40.570 --> 00:02:40.580 
people as you need to do just to make it

00:02:40.580 --> 00:02:43.030 
people as you need to do just to make it
a<00:02:40.670> bit<00:02:40.820> easier<00:02:40.850> for<00:02:41.240> you<00:02:41.420> to<00:02:41.480> get<00:02:41.780> there<00:02:42.040> access

00:02:43.030 --> 00:02:43.040 
a bit easier for you to get there access

a bit easier for you to get there access
this<00:02:43.250> fence<00:02:43.640> mount<00:02:44.540> the<00:02:44.750> turret<00:02:45.140> and<00:02:45.320> if<00:02:45.740> you

00:02:46.000 --> 00:02:46.010 
this fence mount the turret and if you

00:02:46.010 --> 00:02:49.480 
this fence mount the turret and if you
have<00:02:46.370> got<00:02:46.730> toughness<00:02:47.420> as<00:02:47.630> a<00:02:47.690> perk<00:02:48.380> it<00:02:48.950> isn't

00:02:49.480 --> 00:02:49.490 
have got toughness as a perk it isn't

00:02:49.490 --> 00:02:51.520 
have got toughness as a perk it isn't
really<00:02:49.940> needed<00:02:50.090> but<00:02:50.510> it<00:02:50.630> does<00:02:50.840> help<00:02:51.050> a<00:02:51.230> little

00:02:51.520 --> 00:02:51.530 
really needed but it does help a little

00:02:51.530 --> 00:02:54.100 
really needed but it does help a little
bit<00:02:51.710> just<00:02:52.610> to<00:02:52.730> reduce<00:02:53.420> a<00:02:53.570> little<00:02:53.810> bit<00:02:53.930> of<00:02:54.020> the

00:02:54.100 --> 00:02:54.110 
bit just to reduce a little bit of the

00:02:54.110 --> 00:02:57.400 
bit just to reduce a little bit of the
flinching<00:02:54.620> when<00:02:54.650> you<00:02:54.920> get<00:02:55.160> hit<00:02:55.960> what<00:02:56.960> I<00:02:56.990> did<00:02:57.260> is

00:02:57.400 --> 00:02:57.410 
flinching when you get hit what I did is

00:02:57.410 --> 00:02:59.140 
flinching when you get hit what I did is
just<00:02:57.440> chucked<00:02:57.860> an<00:02:57.980> EMP<00:02:58.370> grenade<00:02:58.730> and<00:02:58.940> maybe

00:02:59.140 --> 00:02:59.150 
just chucked an EMP grenade and maybe

00:02:59.150 --> 00:03:02.920 
just chucked an EMP grenade and maybe
shot<00:02:59.840> a<00:02:59.870> couple<00:03:00.320> of<00:03:00.440> the<00:03:01.360> of<00:03:02.360> the<00:03:02.540> drones<00:03:02.810> to

00:03:02.920 --> 00:03:02.930 
shot a couple of the of the drones to

00:03:02.930 --> 00:03:04.210 
shot a couple of the of the drones to
the<00:03:03.140> ground<00:03:03.440> just<00:03:03.709> to<00:03:03.800> make<00:03:03.980> it<00:03:04.010> a<00:03:04.130> little

00:03:04.210 --> 00:03:04.220 
the ground just to make it a little

00:03:04.220 --> 00:03:05.620 
the ground just to make it a little
easier<00:03:04.580> so<00:03:04.730> they<00:03:04.820> weren't<00:03:04.940> always<00:03:05.300> shooting

00:03:05.620 --> 00:03:05.630 
easier so they weren't always shooting

00:03:05.630 --> 00:03:08.560 
easier so they weren't always shooting
me<00:03:05.900> and<00:03:06.140> it<00:03:06.650> just<00:03:06.890> go<00:03:07.250> and<00:03:07.610> take<00:03:07.880> out<00:03:08.120> eight<00:03:08.360> of

00:03:08.560 --> 00:03:08.570 
me and it just go and take out eight of

00:03:08.570 --> 00:03:11.080 
me and it just go and take out eight of
them<00:03:08.720> with<00:03:08.870> this<00:03:08.959> turret<00:03:09.490> okay<00:03:10.490> so<00:03:10.550> this<00:03:10.880> is

00:03:11.080 --> 00:03:11.090 
them with this turret okay so this is

00:03:11.090 --> 00:03:13.180
