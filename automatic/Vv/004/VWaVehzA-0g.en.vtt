00:03:12.610 --> 00:03:16.300 
was in product development in our or
research<00:03:13.610> and<00:03:13.790> development<00:03:14.320> I<00:03:15.320> would<00:03:16.220> have

00:03:16.300 --> 00:03:16.310 
research and development I would have

00:03:16.310 --> 00:03:19.360 
research and development I would have
put<00:03:16.520> plastic<00:03:17.240> on<00:03:17.420> here<00:03:18.110> a<00:03:18.260> really<00:03:18.860> really<00:03:19.010> hard

00:03:19.360 --> 00:03:19.370 
put plastic on here a really really hard

00:03:19.370 --> 00:03:24.010 
put plastic on here a really really hard
plastic<00:03:20.270> but<00:03:21.050> these<00:03:21.320> are<00:03:21.560> metal<00:03:22.400> I<00:03:22.810> guess<00:03:23.810> to

00:03:24.010 --> 00:03:24.020 
plastic but these are metal I guess to

00:03:24.020 --> 00:03:26.350 
plastic but these are metal I guess to
make<00:03:24.140> it<00:03:24.320> last<00:03:24.530> longer<00:03:24.760> but<00:03:25.760> then<00:03:25.940> they<00:03:26.060> finish

00:03:26.350 --> 00:03:26.360 
make it last longer but then they finish

00:03:26.360 --> 00:03:28.840 
make it last longer but then they finish
it<00:03:26.480> off<00:03:26.600> on<00:03:26.780> the<00:03:26.810> top<00:03:27.140> with<00:03:27.440> plastic<00:03:27.980> doesn't

00:03:28.840 --> 00:03:28.850 
it off on the top with plastic doesn't

00:03:28.850 --> 00:03:31.240 
it off on the top with plastic doesn't
really<00:03:28.940> make<00:03:29.090> any<00:03:29.240> sense<00:03:29.630> to<00:03:29.720> me<00:03:29.840> but<00:03:30.470> oh<00:03:30.740> well

00:03:31.240 --> 00:03:31.250 
really make any sense to me but oh well

00:03:31.250 --> 00:03:34.270 
really make any sense to me but oh well
I<00:03:31.550> didn't<00:03:32.330> design<00:03:32.570> it<00:03:32.600> they<00:03:32.840> did<00:03:33.040> so<00:03:34.040> there

00:03:34.270 --> 00:03:34.280 
I didn't design it they did so there

00:03:34.280 --> 00:03:37.930 
I didn't design it they did so there
that<00:03:34.490> is<00:03:34.700> and<00:03:35.000> i<00:03:35.990> would<00:03:36.380> suggest<00:03:36.590> it<00:03:37.100> I've<00:03:37.730> seen

00:03:37.930 --> 00:03:37.940 
that is and i would suggest it I've seen

00:03:37.940 --> 00:03:40.180 
that is and i would suggest it I've seen
several<00:03:38.210> models<00:03:38.660> out<00:03:38.960> there<00:03:38.990> but<00:03:39.920> I<00:03:39.950> don't

00:03:40.180 --> 00:03:40.190 
several models out there but I don't

00:03:40.190 --> 00:03:42.100 
several models out there but I don't
know<00:03:40.340> that<00:03:40.520> any<00:03:40.670> are<00:03:40.880> made<00:03:41.420> as<00:03:41.600> good<00:03:41.780> as<00:03:41.900> this

00:03:42.100 --> 00:03:42.110 
know that any are made as good as this

00:03:42.110 --> 00:03:46.120 
know that any are made as good as this
one<00:03:42.350> so<00:03:43.270> but<00:03:44.270> there's<00:03:44.630> that<00:03:44.870> if<00:03:45.200> you<00:03:46.010> are

00:03:46.120 --> 00:03:46.130 
one so but there's that if you are

00:03:46.130 --> 00:03:49.180 
one so but there's that if you are
wondering<00:03:46.520> exactly<00:03:47.300> how<00:03:47.690> that<00:03:48.020> fits<00:03:48.410> or<00:03:48.860> how

00:03:49.180 --> 00:03:49.190 
wondering exactly how that fits or how

00:03:49.190 --> 00:03:50.830 
wondering exactly how that fits or how
that<00:03:49.370> goes<00:03:49.580> on<00:03:49.730> I<00:03:50.000> know<00:03:50.060> I<00:03:50.209> always<00:03:50.450> look<00:03:50.810> to

00:03:50.830 --> 00:03:50.840 
that goes on I know I always look to

00:03:50.840 --> 00:03:53.800
