00:00:05.780 --> 00:00:09.770
 now all welcome to my channel has to 

00:00:08.180 --> 00:00:12.470
 be a video that has required me and is 

00:00:09.770 --> 00:00:14.059
 about the routine of my hair and is that I 

00:00:12.470 --> 00:00:16.370
 you said for how they have it so 

00:00:14.059 --> 00:00:19.130
 bright and so beautiful all a compliment 

00:00:16.370 --> 00:00:20.810
 for me they say and the truth is that it has 

00:00:19.130 --> 00:00:24.080
 a little bit of work because the hairs 

00:00:20.810 --> 00:00:27.470
 dyed blond clothes because they tend to 

00:00:24.080 --> 00:00:30.830
 be dull without grace without brightness and I 

00:00:27.470 --> 00:00:33.320
 the truth is pretty good enough in 

00:00:30.830 --> 00:00:35.840
 some products for the hair and os what 

00:00:33.320 --> 00:00:37.520
 I teach like this in the bathroom 

00:00:35.840 --> 00:00:39.969
 which is where the engravings or you see well 

00:00:37.520 --> 00:00:43.550
 with what you teach and we have almost been 

00:00:39.969 --> 00:00:46.100
 right after showering and all the 

00:00:43.550 --> 00:00:48.230
 process so that's how you're going to see it 

00:00:46.100 --> 00:00:50.390
 now to wash my hair I use this 

00:00:48.230 --> 00:00:52.280
 panther shampoo smooth and silky but 

00:00:50.390 --> 00:00:54.319
 I alternate it with the shampoo of adele 

00:00:52.280 --> 00:00:56.149
 truth gold liquid below me 

00:00:54.319 --> 00:00:57.890
 applied this nuance shampoo before and I 

00:00:56.149 --> 00:00:59.899
 I leave about ten minutes and then I 

00:00:57.890 --> 00:01:02.059
 put this mask that I love the 

00:00:59.899 --> 00:01:03.979
 I highly recommend that it is also the 

00:01:02.059 --> 00:01:05.990
 of liquid gold the first thing I do is 

00:01:03.979 --> 00:01:08.510
 made to make the hair separate and 

00:01:05.990 --> 00:01:10.250
 it's easier to handle it and I do not 

00:01:08.510 --> 00:01:12.200
 order until it's dry because 

00:01:10.250 --> 00:01:15.040
 combing with wet hair makes it 

00:01:12.200 --> 00:01:17.140
 more easily 

00:01:15.040 --> 00:01:19.030
 and the first product that he uses to be 

00:01:17.140 --> 00:01:22.450
 a deliplus fluid that gives shine to the 

00:01:19.030 --> 00:01:27.090
 hair does not cake and it is also protective 

00:01:22.450 --> 00:01:27.090
 of the heat I apply from medium to ends 

00:01:36.680 --> 00:01:40.850
 next I will apply the self law 

00:01:38.870 --> 00:01:43.160
 of keratin also from the club by 

00:01:40.850 --> 00:01:45.410
 all the wet hair that is activated with the 

00:01:43.160 --> 00:01:48.340
 heat from the dryer or the iron this 

00:01:45.410 --> 00:01:48.340
 control frizz 

00:01:56.520 --> 00:02:00.030
 happens to pull my hair with 

00:01:58.289 --> 00:02:03.270
 air concentrator to make it more 

00:02:00.030 --> 00:02:05.250
 lawful I think it's called like that I understand 

00:02:03.270 --> 00:02:07.950
 dry upside down so as not to spoil so much 

00:02:05.250 --> 00:02:11.300
 the hair on the outside and give volume that 

00:02:07.950 --> 00:02:11.300
 I was recommended by a hairdresser 

00:02:19.170 --> 00:02:24.080
 and as I'm taking it out I'm going 

00:02:21.000 --> 00:02:24.080
 combing it with your fingers 

00:02:34.510 --> 00:02:38.189
 and once dry he combed it 

00:02:48.290 --> 00:02:52.280
 now applied this product from part in 

00:02:50.540 --> 00:02:54.620
 that for the hair frizz and it's 

00:02:52.280 --> 00:02:56.799
 terrific we apply a lot of means to 

00:02:54.620 --> 00:02:56.799
 tips 

00:03:09.280 --> 00:03:12.600
 and we go back to combing 

00:03:15.350 --> 00:03:19.460
 and so it would be sometimes I leave it like this and 

00:03:17.840 --> 00:03:21.830
 other times I also ironed it 

00:03:19.460 --> 00:03:24.440
 little but now I'm going to iron 

00:03:21.830 --> 00:03:26.270
 so you can see all the change my iron 

00:03:24.440 --> 00:03:28.430
 Coriolis fashion you can find in 

00:03:26.270 --> 00:03:30.920
 the hairdresser's house and it's great and 

00:03:28.430 --> 00:03:32.390
 I will also use a wide-barbed comb on 

00:03:30.920 --> 00:03:34.190
 bangs always iron me because 

00:03:32.390 --> 00:03:36.800
 it stays the way of when I put it 

00:03:34.190 --> 00:03:38.960
 behind the ears and we're helping 

00:03:36.800 --> 00:03:40.700
 the time we are ironing 

00:03:38.960 --> 00:03:41.870
 I do not usually iron it much 

00:03:40.700 --> 00:03:43.640
 because it fits me well with the 

00:03:41.870 --> 00:03:46.130
 products but now in summer I use less 

00:03:43.640 --> 00:03:48.880
 the dryer and then you're ready 

00:03:46.130 --> 00:03:48.880
 more of the iron 

00:04:02.850 --> 00:04:05.900
 and this is the result 

00:04:13.819 --> 00:04:17.989
 and nothing gives of the fight although yes 

00:04:16.280 --> 00:04:19.579
 you have some doubts about the products 

00:04:17.989 --> 00:04:22.610
 Then ask me to answer them 

00:04:19.579 --> 00:04:24.889
 delighted although most are from 

00:04:22.610 --> 00:04:27.199
 market nothing of the club and they are quite 

00:04:24.889 --> 00:04:29.000
 you can for my taste is very very cheap and 

00:04:27.199 --> 00:04:31.220
 that of any doubt that they have already leaves 

00:04:29.000 --> 00:04:33.620
 down here that if they leave you a trick 

00:04:31.220 --> 00:04:35.780

00:04:33.620 --> 00:04:37.400
 leave me here below and if you do these 

00:04:35.780 --> 00:04:39.229
 products that I have used you can already do 

00:04:37.400 --> 00:04:41.090
 the little face of information tell me how it goes 

00:04:39.229 --> 00:04:43.490
 maybe everyone is not going to 

00:04:41.090 --> 00:04:44.990
 just as well who goes out you can not 

00:04:43.490 --> 00:04:46.849
