00:00:21.620 --> 00:00:24.590
 chihuahua bearer welcome one 

00:00:23.360 --> 00:00:26.630
 more time to the interactive diet of 

00:00:24.590 --> 00:00:29.360
 youtube today we fulfill just one 

00:00:26.630 --> 00:00:31.490
 week of diet and we should be already 

00:00:29.360 --> 00:00:33.380
 weighing in the morning and well I always 

00:00:31.490 --> 00:00:35.480
 I recommend that we think in the morning 

00:00:33.380 --> 00:00:38.210
 Once we have evacuated, it will be gone 

00:00:35.480 --> 00:00:39.800
 to the bathroom and so on forever to have the 

00:00:38.210 --> 00:00:42.200
 same record of the same hour what 

00:00:39.800 --> 00:00:43.670
 You're thinking you where you spent all 

00:00:42.200 --> 00:00:45.650
 the night of sleep and probably not 

00:00:43.670 --> 00:00:49.220
 you have had breakfast and this is the 

00:00:45.650 --> 00:00:50.510
 the cutest moment of the day let's say and 

00:00:49.220 --> 00:00:53.210
 results for me have been quite 

00:00:50.510 --> 00:00:56.660
 good indeed and I was weighing 68.6 

00:00:53.210 --> 00:00:58.430
 kilos in forgiveness 68 points 2 kilos what 

00:00:56.660 --> 00:01:01.280
 that I felt lost since I started 

00:00:58.430 --> 00:01:02.989
 that were 70 kilos exact 1.8 kilos in 

00:01:01.280 --> 00:01:04.550
 this first week now how had 

00:01:02.989 --> 00:01:06.080
 spoken in a previous video very much 

00:01:04.550 --> 00:01:08.030
 of that weight that I lost has to do 

00:01:06.080 --> 00:01:10.400
 with a liquid and from now on 

00:01:08.030 --> 00:01:12.620
 I will be able to see really exactly 

00:01:10.400 --> 00:01:15.170
 how to die moving with the diet and see 

00:01:12.620 --> 00:01:17.090
 what adjustments do I have to make even with 

00:01:15.170 --> 00:01:19.159
 great loss of liquid from the first 

00:01:17.090 --> 00:01:20.630
 week I have a feeling that so many 

00:01:19.159 --> 00:01:22.430
 I'm eating much less than 

00:01:20.630 --> 00:01:24.620
 I expected then it is likely that 

00:01:22.430 --> 00:01:28.340
 increase a bit from today 

00:01:24.620 --> 00:01:30.410
 and caloric consumption to not stop and 

00:01:28.340 --> 00:01:32.060
 eliminate the diet but to lose 

00:01:30.410 --> 00:01:33.800
 a bit like a form of 

00:01:32.060 --> 00:01:35.240
 consistent because I will continue to be 

00:01:33.800 --> 00:01:36.830
 to me just as consistent still we 

00:01:35.240 --> 00:01:38.450
 there are two weeks of edith ox but 

00:01:36.830 --> 00:01:40.940
 definitely in a way that 

00:01:38.450 --> 00:01:43.000
 do not feel I'm going down so many 

00:01:40.940 --> 00:01:46.190
 calories that are likely to affect 

00:01:43.000 --> 00:01:48.170
 also my attempt to maintain muscle and 

00:01:46.190 --> 00:01:49.370
 of even making me stronger and 

00:01:48.170 --> 00:01:50.840
 just that I wanted to talk about 

00:01:49.370 --> 00:01:53.570
 they sent me a message 

00:01:50.840 --> 00:01:55.310
 wondering that how many crunches 

00:01:53.570 --> 00:01:57.290
 had to be done and how many types of 

00:01:55.310 --> 00:01:59.080
 exercise to lower the belly and is 

00:01:57.290 --> 00:02:01.670
 because people have an understanding 

00:01:59.080 --> 00:02:03.860
 wrong of how the body eliminates the 

00:02:01.670 --> 00:02:05.780
 fats and of course it's also fault 

00:02:03.860 --> 00:02:08.140
 of a whole bunch of ads on TV 

00:02:05.780 --> 00:02:10.790
 of different supplements especially 

00:02:08.140 --> 00:02:12.290
 exercises and types of devices for 

00:02:10.790 --> 00:02:13.910
 do exercises in which they 

00:02:12.290 --> 00:02:16.400
 they teach people that if they make a 

00:02:13.910 --> 00:02:19.310
 million abdominals for eight 

00:02:16.400 --> 00:02:21.110
 minutes a day they will have stomach and 

00:02:19.310 --> 00:02:22.820
 they show you these photos of those super 

00:02:21.110 --> 00:02:25.310
 models or of these people who are 

00:02:22.820 --> 00:02:27.110
 definitely people very knowledgeable about 

00:02:25.310 --> 00:02:29.209
 fitness world in which by 

00:02:27.110 --> 00:02:30.230
 course do not have a single fat in the 

00:02:29.209 --> 00:02:32.480
 stomach 

00:02:30.230 --> 00:02:35.090
 in defined squares and an abdomen 

00:02:32.480 --> 00:02:38.659
 perfect and all that pile of nonsense and 

00:02:35.090 --> 00:02:41.330
 the reality is that they are not there 

00:02:38.659 --> 00:02:44.090
 No way to lose weight by burning 

00:02:41.330 --> 00:02:45.890
 localized fat what do I mean if 

00:02:44.090 --> 00:02:47.900
 you feel that you have fat arms 

00:02:45.890 --> 00:02:49.930
 and they want to lose fat in the arms 

00:02:47.900 --> 00:02:52.340
 make a million euros to raise 

00:02:49.930 --> 00:02:54.590
 dumbbells or bars to exercise 

00:02:52.340 --> 00:02:57.110
 degrees will not burn them anymore 

00:02:54.590 --> 00:02:59.060
 fast body fat the body 

00:02:57.110 --> 00:03:01.280
 of you make the decision the same 

00:02:59.060 --> 00:03:03.260
 depending on how many deposits of 

00:03:01.280 --> 00:03:05.690
 fat have in which parts of the body 

00:03:03.260 --> 00:03:07.819
 to see where you're going to get those extras 

00:03:05.690 --> 00:03:10.160
 calories that you occupy when you are 

00:03:07.819 --> 00:03:12.109
 in a caloric deficit what does it mean 

00:03:10.160 --> 00:03:14.180
 that you are going to lose fat from 

00:03:12.109 --> 00:03:15.890
 absolutely the whole body when I 

00:03:14.180 --> 00:03:17.840
 I was pretty fat and I started my 

00:03:15.890 --> 00:03:19.220
 first diet I realized things that 

00:03:17.840 --> 00:03:20.599
 I never would have thought of it 

00:03:19.220 --> 00:03:22.080
 example my wedding ring see 

00:03:20.599 --> 00:03:25.020
 how it comes out 

00:03:22.080 --> 00:03:26.700
 I lost fat from my fingers and shoes 

00:03:25.020 --> 00:03:28.380
 that they used at that time they started me 

00:03:26.700 --> 00:03:30.480
 look great because I also lost 

00:03:28.380 --> 00:03:31.830
 fat feet never places 

00:03:30.480 --> 00:03:33.930
 had included because when I saw myself 

00:03:31.830 --> 00:03:35.940
 my hands or I saw my feet according to me 

00:03:33.930 --> 00:03:38.160
 They were thin and of course nothing that 

00:03:35.940 --> 00:03:40.380
 see now I can say that they were pretty 

00:03:38.160 --> 00:03:42.030
 fat in comparison or in relation to 

00:03:40.380 --> 00:03:44.370
 rest of my body what happens is that 

00:03:42.030 --> 00:03:46.770
 men tend to accumulate more 

00:03:44.370 --> 00:03:48.600
 fat in the stomach and sometimes the double chin 

00:03:46.770 --> 00:03:50.970
 in the face and then we are believing 

00:03:48.600 --> 00:03:53.250
 we have the idea that the only way to 

00:03:50.970 --> 00:03:56.730
 lose weight and look good is losing the 

00:03:53.250 --> 00:03:58.290
 weight of the belly and that's why to one 

00:03:56.730 --> 00:03:59.700
 they put all that pile of ideas in the 

00:03:58.290 --> 00:04:01.470
 tele and in this heap of ads that 

00:03:59.700 --> 00:04:04.620
 I'm telling you that if you do 

00:04:01.470 --> 00:04:06.990
 exercises that attack the tummy then 

00:04:04.620 --> 00:04:09.120
 you're going to go down for the weight there but so 

00:04:06.990 --> 00:04:10.920
 it's not how it works for the 

00:04:09.120 --> 00:04:12.959
 men is just the stomach the 

00:04:10.920 --> 00:04:15.090
 last place where the body starts to 

00:04:12.959 --> 00:04:17.370
 lower tummy and fat because they are the 

00:04:15.090 --> 00:04:19.049
 more centralized deposits of fat and 

00:04:17.370 --> 00:04:21.150
 just unfairly the point where the 

00:04:19.049 --> 00:04:23.310
 body tries to hold on to those 

00:04:21.150 --> 00:04:24.810
 last fats to have in case of 

00:04:23.310 --> 00:04:26.010
 some famine because they remember the 

00:04:24.810 --> 00:04:27.570
 body is so smart 

00:04:26.010 --> 00:04:29.460
 with women by age is not the 

00:04:27.570 --> 00:04:30.720
 stomach but if I'm a being one of 

00:04:29.460 --> 00:04:32.700
 the girls are watching this program 

00:04:30.720 --> 00:04:34.830
 they are probably realizing that 

00:04:32.700 --> 00:04:37.080
 on the buttocks and on the legs are 

00:04:34.830 --> 00:04:39.780
 let's say the most problematic places 

00:04:37.080 --> 00:04:41.910
 for the girls and that is unlike 

00:04:39.780 --> 00:04:43.170
 men the way in which 

00:04:41.910 --> 00:04:46.320
 bodies of men and women 

00:04:43.170 --> 00:04:47.490
 accumulate fat now if you do not think 

00:04:46.320 --> 00:04:50.760
 nor seeing this picture that you can see it 

00:04:47.490 --> 00:04:52.710
 Here is the typical photo of muscles of 

00:04:50.760 --> 00:04:54.270
 how is it called from a sketch let's say 

00:04:52.710 --> 00:04:56.910
 how are the muscles of the body and this 

00:04:54.270 --> 00:04:58.680
 it's a masculine healing account that 

00:04:56.910 --> 00:05:00.960
 different sizes of muscles in the 

00:04:58.680 --> 00:05:02.520
 body are the ones they will give 

00:05:00.960 --> 00:05:04.500
 you an idea of ​​what muscles 

00:05:02.520 --> 00:05:06.540
 they should burn more or burn less fat 

00:05:04.500 --> 00:05:09.120
 and they're just going to see that the muscles 

00:05:06.540 --> 00:05:10.560
 of the abdomen is a super muscular group 

00:05:09.120 --> 00:05:12.450
 tiny are the muscles most 

00:05:10.560 --> 00:05:14.100
 small what it means when you 

00:05:12.450 --> 00:05:16.380
 they exercise in the abdomen or the 

00:05:14.100 --> 00:05:18.390
 squatting miracle I say sorry 

00:05:16.380 --> 00:05:20.090
 a thousand crunches that you are 

00:05:18.390 --> 00:05:22.770
 believing that they can do to lower 

00:05:20.090 --> 00:05:25.020
 tummy fat are more of the 

00:05:22.770 --> 00:05:27.060
 more inefficient to burn calories and 

00:05:25.020 --> 00:05:28.540
 instead watching this drawing if you 

00:05:27.060 --> 00:05:30.580
 see the size of the 

00:05:28.540 --> 00:05:31.900
 the lower leg muscles go away 

00:05:30.580 --> 00:05:34.060
 to realize that these are the muscles 

00:05:31.900 --> 00:05:36.490
 bigger than the body has and that 

00:05:34.060 --> 00:05:38.440
 you exercise the legs are going to be 

00:05:36.490 --> 00:05:40.020
 just the muscles that Mexico is 

00:05:38.440 --> 00:05:41.710
 they become stronger muscles 

00:05:40.020 --> 00:05:43.570
 they are definitely going to be the ones that 

00:05:41.710 --> 00:05:45.340
 consume calories what the 

00:05:43.570 --> 00:05:48.490
 end of the day that will be the most 

00:05:45.340 --> 00:05:49.990
 consume or burn fat for you what 

00:05:48.490 --> 00:05:51.520
 what it means and this is not just a 

00:05:49.990 --> 00:05:53.260
 small idea I will not go into details 

00:05:51.520 --> 00:05:56.260
 still on exercises maybe tomorrow 

00:05:53.260 --> 00:05:57.850
 I'm going to do a little more of trying a 

00:05:56.260 --> 00:05:59.350
 little bit more about how to exercise 

00:05:57.850 --> 00:06:01.060
 like not exercising but what does 

00:05:59.350 --> 00:06:02.800
 I 'm going to tell you now is not to leave 

00:06:01.060 --> 00:06:04.630
 cheat for all the pile of shits 

00:06:02.800 --> 00:06:06.580
 you see on TV especially 

00:06:04.630 --> 00:06:08.110
 aiming when the goal of 

00:06:06.580 --> 00:06:10.150
 those shits that watch TV are 

00:06:08.110 --> 00:06:12.820
 sell you some hits that for 

00:06:10.150 --> 00:06:14.740
 usually do not need is good to do 

00:06:12.820 --> 00:06:17.350
 exercises in the abdomen I do not say no 

00:06:14.740 --> 00:06:20.740
 be an important muscle group but 

00:06:17.350 --> 00:06:22.480
 it's really not the muscle group that's going 

00:06:20.740 --> 00:06:24.490
 to consume so many calories that helps them 

00:06:22.480 --> 00:06:26.440
 be going to you lose weight and more 

00:06:24.490 --> 00:06:28.120
 focus on seeing that photo that 

00:06:26.440 --> 00:06:29.260
 I taught before what the groups are 

00:06:28.120 --> 00:06:31.000
 muscular 

00:06:29.260 --> 00:06:33.490
 of the body that are the ones that obviously 

00:06:31.000 --> 00:06:35.320
 they will require more calories than all 

00:06:33.490 --> 00:06:38.380
 the days and that's why I tell you once 

00:06:35.320 --> 00:06:40.270

00:06:40.270 --> 00:06:44.740

00:06:42.490 --> 00:06:47.290
 lose belly fat you have to 

00:06:44.740 --> 00:06:49.120
