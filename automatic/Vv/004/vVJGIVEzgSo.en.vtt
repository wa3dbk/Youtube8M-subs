00:03:40.650 --> 00:03:42.800 
bubble thing right there not sure if
you're<00:03:40.769> able<00:03:40.859> to<00:03:41.069> see<00:03:41.370> it<00:03:41.489> but<00:03:41.639> um<00:03:42.389> it's<00:03:42.629> like<00:03:42.659> a

00:03:42.800 --> 00:03:42.810 
you're able to see it but um it's like a

00:03:42.810 --> 00:03:44.330 
you're able to see it but um it's like a
speech<00:03:43.049> bubble<00:03:43.349> at<00:03:43.590> the<00:03:43.680> top<00:03:43.889> so<00:03:44.129> I<00:03:44.159> thought

00:03:44.330 --> 00:03:44.340 
speech bubble at the top so I thought

00:03:44.340 --> 00:03:47.030 
speech bubble at the top so I thought
that's<00:03:44.549> really<00:03:45.090> cute<00:03:45.359> and<00:03:45.599> then<00:03:46.319> I<00:03:46.349> think<00:03:46.859> I

00:03:47.030 --> 00:03:47.040 
that's really cute and then I think I

00:03:47.040 --> 00:03:49.430 
that's really cute and then I think I
also<00:03:47.159> have<00:03:47.519> two<00:03:47.940> more<00:03:47.970> stamps<00:03:48.540> I<00:03:48.720> have<00:03:49.199> one

00:03:49.430 --> 00:03:49.440 
also have two more stamps I have one

00:03:49.440 --> 00:03:51.830 
also have two more stamps I have one
that's<00:03:49.590> just<00:03:49.859> kind<00:03:50.069> of<00:03:50.099> like<00:03:50.280> this<00:03:51.120> out<00:03:51.359> off<00:03:51.540> I

00:03:51.830 --> 00:03:51.840 
that's just kind of like this out off I

00:03:51.840 --> 00:03:53.780 
that's just kind of like this out off I
guess<00:03:52.440> it's<00:03:52.620> kind<00:03:52.769> of<00:03:52.799> like<00:03:52.889> a<00:03:52.949> snowflake<00:03:53.280> so<00:03:53.760> I

00:03:53.780 --> 00:03:53.790 
guess it's kind of like a snowflake so I

00:03:53.790 --> 00:03:56.599 
guess it's kind of like a snowflake so I
got<00:03:54.030> that<00:03:54.060> and<00:03:54.569> then<00:03:54.659> I<00:03:55.409> also<00:03:55.620> got<00:03:55.919> a<00:03:56.129> letter

00:03:56.599 --> 00:03:56.609 
got that and then I also got a letter

00:03:56.609 --> 00:03:59.360 
got that and then I also got a letter
set<00:03:57.000> so<00:03:57.299> my<00:03:57.930> alphabet<00:03:58.290> said<00:03:58.650> just<00:03:58.919> in<00:03:59.010> case<00:03:59.220> I

00:03:59.360 --> 00:03:59.370 
set so my alphabet said just in case I

00:03:59.370 --> 00:04:00.860 
set so my alphabet said just in case I
want<00:03:59.549> to<00:03:59.699> stamp<00:03:59.970> down<00:04:00.209> things<00:04:00.510> instead<00:04:00.810> of

00:04:00.860 --> 00:04:00.870 
want to stamp down things instead of

00:04:00.870 --> 00:04:02.960 
want to stamp down things instead of
write<00:04:01.079> them<00:04:01.349> I<00:04:01.590> mean<00:04:02.129> that<00:04:02.250> take<00:04:02.430> a<00:04:02.459> long<00:04:02.669> time

00:04:02.960 --> 00:04:02.970 
write them I mean that take a long time

00:04:02.970 --> 00:04:06.140 
write them I mean that take a long time
but<00:04:03.590> yeah<00:04:04.590> so<00:04:05.129> I<00:04:05.459> think<00:04:05.519> that's<00:04:05.879> all<00:04:06.030> the

00:04:06.140 --> 00:04:06.150 
but yeah so I think that's all the

00:04:06.150 --> 00:04:07.369 
but yeah so I think that's all the
stamps<00:04:06.510> they<00:04:06.720> have<00:04:06.900> and<00:04:07.169> then<00:04:07.260> the<00:04:07.349> next

00:04:07.369 --> 00:04:07.379 
stamps they have and then the next

00:04:07.379 --> 00:04:09.379
