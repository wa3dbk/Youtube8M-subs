00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.980
 good all together and it's more to cultivate 

00:00:03.210 --> 00:00:06.990
 and let's talk again about the clever saurus 

00:00:04.980 --> 00:00:08.460
 but I think that besides recognizing 

00:00:06.990 --> 00:00:10.349
 all those who still do not know 

00:00:08.460 --> 00:00:12.210
 Who am I, I am Dragon Dragons 

00:00:10.349 --> 00:00:14.040
 spits eastern semen fought against titan 

00:00:12.210 --> 00:00:15.960
 and what you think is superior fun 

00:00:14.040 --> 00:00:17.640
 understanding contained his comedy humor 

00:00:15.960 --> 00:00:19.500
 laughter madness gilipolleces things 

00:00:17.640 --> 00:00:21.060
 funny that I had serial themes and 

00:00:19.500 --> 00:00:22.920
 proceeded then that you like it you cool 

00:00:21.060 --> 00:00:24.390
 things that not all of that here and now I am 

00:00:22.920 --> 00:00:26.070
 the one that defends the defenseless of everything 

00:00:24.390 --> 00:00:28.080
 the retarded is with scary cardboard ass 

00:00:26.070 --> 00:00:29.550
 I have no weak points I have power and 

00:00:28.080 --> 00:00:31.529
 balls and after you introduced me 

00:00:29.550 --> 00:00:33.360
 now we are going to give way to the dossier 

00:00:31.529 --> 00:00:35.399
 creature with the name as a ready 

00:00:33.360 --> 00:00:37.309
 saurus of the species to me yes fidelis 

00:00:35.399 --> 00:00:40.590
 he lived from the end of the Triassic Permian 

00:00:37.309 --> 00:00:43.530
 early is the book and loyal temperament 

00:00:40.590 --> 00:00:45.719
 Wild modus operandi is a small 

00:00:43.530 --> 00:00:47.550
 common herbivore is a the common vehicle 

00:00:45.719 --> 00:00:50.010
 in much of the island is around 

00:00:47.550 --> 00:00:51.120
 two feet long foot depends not 

00:00:50.010 --> 00:00:53.940
 is at the top of the food chain 

00:00:51.120 --> 00:00:55.770
 and eat small plant life insects 

00:00:53.940 --> 00:00:58.050
 poisonous island patient in the little 

00:00:55.770 --> 00:00:59.969
 interest with the liter saurus let's not 

00:00:58.050 --> 00:01:02.309
 they attack her despite being one of the 

00:00:59.969 --> 00:01:04.229
 most minute herbivores on the island is 

00:01:02.309 --> 00:01:06.960
 an incredibly survivor 

00:01:04.229 --> 00:01:09.060
 resistant recover in turn also 

00:01:06.960 --> 00:01:12.270
 much faster than any other 

00:01:09.060 --> 00:01:14.640
 creature and here it tells us what makes a 

00:01:12.270 --> 00:01:17.130
 difficult task to leave unconscious is 

00:01:14.640 --> 00:01:20.250
 a task pretty fucked already 

00:01:17.130 --> 00:01:22.229
 we will check is not surprising our 

00:01:20.250 --> 00:01:25.200
 Saurians is a very loyal pet once 

00:01:22.229 --> 00:01:27.000
 domesticated is a very fast student by 

00:01:25.200 --> 00:01:28.770
 what you gain experience with a lot 

00:01:27.000 --> 00:01:31.380
 ease in most others 

00:01:28.770 --> 00:01:33.960
 creatures in addition their presence is close 

00:01:31.380 --> 00:01:37.170
 a seems to inspire the allies so 

00:01:33.960 --> 00:01:38.640
 that learning and gaining experience is still 

00:01:37.170 --> 00:01:40.440
 faster 

00:01:38.640 --> 00:01:42.570
 that is to say that it is convenient to have it next 

00:01:40.440 --> 00:01:45.149
 could increase your experience by 

00:01:42.570 --> 00:01:47.190
 two or three is an excellent addition 

00:01:45.149 --> 00:01:49.560
 to the party of the house of any 

00:01:47.190 --> 00:01:51.450
 tribe or here I do not know anything at the end of the 

00:01:49.560 --> 00:01:52.830
 last paragraph and this is all I've already 

00:01:51.450 --> 00:01:55.080
 presented so we do not see the end of the 

00:01:52.830 --> 00:01:56.600
 video if you have any questions I will add 

00:01:55.080 --> 00:01:59.520
 new teachers who have left 

00:01:56.600 --> 00:02:03.740
 soon I hope we see each other in the 

00:01:59.520 --> 00:02:03.740
 next video up guys and girls
