00:00:14.839 --> 00:00:14.849 
where you mentioned that the

00:00:14.849 --> 00:00:18.320 
where you mentioned that the
architecture<00:00:15.780> is<00:00:15.960> not<00:00:15.990> art<00:00:16.500> and<00:00:17.330> actually

architecture is not art and actually

00:00:18.330 --> 00:00:20.689 
architecture is not art and actually
looking<00:00:18.570> at<00:00:18.660> your<00:00:19.160> pieces<00:00:20.160> that<00:00:20.340> your

00:00:20.689 --> 00:00:20.699 
looking at your pieces that your

00:00:20.699 --> 00:00:23.000 
looking at your pieces that your
buildings<00:00:21.330> I<00:00:21.689> cannot<00:00:22.350> think<00:00:22.500> of<00:00:22.650> more

00:00:23.000 --> 00:00:23.010 
buildings I cannot think of more

00:00:23.010 --> 00:00:25.310

artistic<00:00:23.519> eye<00:00:23.760> or<00:00:23.910> your<00:00:24.060> objects<00:00:24.510> so<00:00:24.630> can<00:00:25.230> you

00:00:25.310 --> 00:00:25.320 
artistic eye or your objects so can you

00:00:25.320 --> 00:00:28.429 
artistic eye or your objects so can you
maybe<00:00:25.470> elaborate<00:00:25.890> on<00:00:26.070> that<00:00:27.109> well<00:00:28.109> this<00:00:28.230> was

00:00:28.429 --> 00:00:28.439 
maybe elaborate on that well this was

00:00:28.439 --> 00:00:33.139 
maybe elaborate on that well this was
something<00:00:29.330> which<00:00:30.330> I'm<00:00:31.160> trying<00:00:32.160> to<00:00:32.460> argue<00:00:32.759> for

00:00:33.139 --> 00:00:33.149 
something which I'm trying to argue for

00:00:33.149 --> 00:00:36.410 
something which I'm trying to argue for
I<00:00:33.210> mean<00:00:33.480> I<00:00:34.010> want<00:00:35.010> to<00:00:35.070> make<00:00:35.219> a<00:00:35.250> distinction<00:00:35.640> if

00:00:36.410 --> 00:00:36.420 
I mean I want to make a distinction if

00:00:36.420 --> 00:00:39.799 
I mean I want to make a distinction if
you<00:00:37.550> think<00:00:38.550> it's<00:00:38.760> artistic<00:00:39.059> and<00:00:39.360> it<00:00:39.420> appeals

00:00:39.799 --> 00:00:39.809 
you think it's artistic and it appeals

00:00:39.809 --> 00:00:41.299 
you think it's artistic and it appeals
to<00:00:39.960> you<00:00:40.140> that<00:00:40.379> has<00:00:40.500> aesthetic<00:00:40.920> qualities

00:00:41.299 --> 00:00:41.309 
to you that has aesthetic qualities

00:00:41.309 --> 00:00:43.760 
to you that has aesthetic qualities
that's<00:00:42.300> great<00:00:42.570> and<00:00:42.780> that's<00:00:43.110> the<00:00:43.320> purpose

00:00:43.760 --> 00:00:43.770 
that's great and that's the purpose

00:00:43.770 --> 00:00:46.220 
that's great and that's the purpose
that's<00:00:44.040> our<00:00:44.399> intention<00:00:44.899> but<00:00:45.899> I<00:00:45.960> don't<00:00:46.140> think

00:00:46.220 --> 00:00:46.230 
that's our intention but I don't think

00:00:46.230 --> 00:00:48.319 
that's our intention but I don't think
that's<00:00:46.410> only<00:00:46.559> art<00:00:46.829> has<00:00:47.129> that<00:00:47.340> and<00:00:47.550> what<00:00:48.000> I<00:00:48.030> want

00:00:48.319 --> 00:00:48.329 
that's only art has that and what I want

00:00:48.329 --> 00:00:51.889 
that's only art has that and what I want
to<00:00:48.390> distinguish<00:00:48.870> is<00:00:49.190> contemporary<00:00:50.190> art<00:00:50.899> which

00:00:51.889 --> 00:00:51.899 
to distinguish is contemporary art which

00:00:51.899 --> 00:00:55.540 
to distinguish is contemporary art which
is<00:00:51.930> the<00:00:52.110> kind<00:00:52.320> of<00:00:52.469> discourse<00:00:53.309> of<00:00:53.460> provocation

00:00:55.540 --> 00:00:55.550 
is the kind of discourse of provocation

00:00:55.550 --> 00:01:00.200 
is the kind of discourse of provocation
stimulation<00:00:56.550> of<00:00:56.940> avenues<00:00:57.800> which<00:00:58.800> is<00:00:59.210> refusing

00:01:00.200 --> 00:01:00.210 
stimulation of avenues which is refusing

00:01:00.210 --> 00:01:05.240 
stimulation of avenues which is refusing
point-blank<00:01:01.020> any<00:01:01.469> instrumentalization<00:01:04.250> as

00:01:05.240 --> 00:01:05.250 
point-blank any instrumentalization as

00:01:05.250 --> 00:01:06.649 
point-blank any instrumentalization as
soon<00:01:05.430> as<00:01:05.549> it's<00:01:05.700> getting<00:01:05.909> instrumentalized

00:01:06.649 --> 00:01:06.659 
soon as it's getting instrumentalized

00:01:06.659 --> 00:01:08.539 
soon as it's getting instrumentalized
it's<00:01:06.869> ejected<00:01:07.049> from<00:01:07.560> the<00:01:07.740> art<00:01:07.890> world<00:01:08.010> this<00:01:08.490> is

00:01:08.539 --> 00:01:08.549 
it's ejected from the art world this is

00:01:08.549 --> 00:01:11.060 
it's ejected from the art world this is
just<00:01:08.670> a<00:01:08.760> statement<00:01:08.939> about<00:01:09.210> how<00:01:09.960> this<00:01:10.200> social

00:01:11.060 --> 00:01:11.070 
just a statement about how this social

00:01:11.070 --> 00:01:12.890 
just a statement about how this social
domain<00:01:11.400> of<00:01:11.640> the<00:01:11.729> art<00:01:11.880> world<00:01:12.150> works<00:01:12.479> and<00:01:12.840> is

00:01:12.890 --> 00:01:12.900 
domain of the art world works and is

00:01:12.900 --> 00:01:15.230 
domain of the art world works and is
different<00:01:13.439> from<00:01:13.619> the<00:01:13.710> design<00:01:13.830> world<00:01:14.240> right

00:01:15.230 --> 00:01:15.240 
different from the design world right

00:01:15.240 --> 00:01:19.310 
different from the design world right
now<00:01:15.810> we<00:01:15.869> get<00:01:16.229> stimulated<00:01:16.890> we<00:01:17.189> sometimes<00:01:18.320> enter

00:01:19.310 --> 00:01:19.320 
now we get stimulated we sometimes enter

00:01:19.320 --> 00:01:22.039 
now we get stimulated we sometimes enter
the<00:01:19.470> art<00:01:19.740> world<00:01:19.950> as<00:01:20.750> architects<00:01:21.750> when<00:01:21.869> we

00:01:22.039 --> 00:01:22.049 
the art world as architects when we

00:01:22.049 --> 00:01:24.880 
the art world as architects when we
developing<00:01:22.740> some<00:01:23.009> things<00:01:23.280> which<00:01:23.520> has<00:01:23.729> no

00:01:24.880 --> 00:01:24.890 
developing some things which has no

00:01:24.890 --> 00:01:27.830 
developing some things which has no
instrumentality<00:01:25.890> yet<00:01:26.189> we<00:01:26.729> don't<00:01:26.939> it<00:01:27.390> doesn't

00:01:27.830 --> 00:01:27.840 
instrumentality yet we don't it doesn't

00:01:27.840 --> 00:01:30.590 
instrumentality yet we don't it doesn't
work<00:01:28.110> yet<00:01:28.439> it<00:01:29.280> we<00:01:29.549> don't<00:01:29.729> know<00:01:29.970> what<00:01:30.150> it's<00:01:30.299> good

00:01:30.590 --> 00:01:30.600 
work yet it we don't know what it's good

00:01:30.600 --> 00:01:30.950

for
and<00:01:31.229> we<00:01:31.380> and<00:01:31.590> at<00:01:32.310> that<00:01:32.670> point<00:01:32.970> we're<00:01:33.270> just

00:01:33.289 --> 00:01:33.299 
and we and at that point we're just

00:01:33.299 --> 00:01:35.149 
and we and at that point we're just
experimenting<00:01:34.290> with<00:01:34.470> form<00:01:34.860> with

00:01:35.149 --> 00:01:35.159 
experimenting with form with

00:01:35.159 --> 00:01:37.690 
experimenting with form with
manufacturing<00:01:36.000> with<00:01:36.390> shape<00:01:36.720> with<00:01:36.960> material

manufacturing with shape with material

00:01:37.700 --> 00:01:40.940 
manufacturing with shape with material
at<00:01:38.700> that<00:01:39.000> point<00:01:39.299> it<00:01:39.509> is<00:01:39.560> exists<00:01:40.560> in<00:01:40.680> the<00:01:40.799> art

00:01:40.940 --> 00:01:40.950 
at that point it is exists in the art

00:01:40.950 --> 00:01:43.100 
at that point it is exists in the art
world<00:01:41.270> but<00:01:42.270> we<00:01:42.420> are<00:01:42.479> not<00:01:42.600> professional

00:01:43.100 --> 00:01:43.110 
world but we are not professional

00:01:43.110 --> 00:01:44.840 
world but we are not professional
artists<00:01:43.770> who<00:01:43.920> are<00:01:44.100> kind<00:01:44.310> of<00:01:44.399> getting<00:01:44.700> lost

00:01:44.840 --> 00:01:44.850 
artists who are kind of getting lost

00:01:44.850 --> 00:01:47.920 
artists who are kind of getting lost
there<00:01:45.060> we<00:01:45.840> go<00:01:46.110> dip<00:01:46.500> into<00:01:46.710> the<00:01:46.890> art<00:01:47.040> world<00:01:47.130> and

00:01:47.920 --> 00:01:47.930 
there we go dip into the art world and

00:01:47.930 --> 00:01:52.670 
there we go dip into the art world and
creating<00:01:50.329> works<00:01:51.329> of<00:01:51.600> art<00:01:51.840> which<00:01:52.079> which<00:01:52.500> are

00:01:52.670 --> 00:01:52.680 
creating works of art which which are

00:01:52.680 --> 00:01:54.530 
creating works of art which which are
later<00:01:52.890> on<00:01:53.090> instrumentalized<00:01:54.090> to<00:01:54.240> become

00:01:54.530 --> 00:01:54.540 
later on instrumentalized to become

00:01:54.540 --> 00:01:57.380 
later on instrumentalized to become
designs<00:01:54.930> but<00:01:55.740> a<00:01:55.979> design<00:01:56.700> is<00:01:56.850> something<00:01:57.240> more

00:01:57.380 --> 00:01:57.390 
designs but a design is something more

00:01:57.390 --> 00:01:59.240 
designs but a design is something more
ambitious<00:01:57.479> oh<00:01:58.170> it's<00:01:58.590> something<00:01:58.799> different

00:01:59.240 --> 00:01:59.250 
ambitious oh it's something different

00:01:59.250 --> 00:02:01.340 
ambitious oh it's something different
anyway<00:01:59.460> it<00:01:59.729> really<00:02:00.180> intervenes<00:02:00.869> in<00:02:01.049> everyday

00:02:01.340 --> 00:02:01.350 
anyway it really intervenes in everyday

00:02:01.350 --> 00:02:04.569 
anyway it really intervenes in everyday
life<00:02:01.560> and<00:02:01.920> serves<00:02:02.640> the<00:02:02.820> purpose<00:02:03.360> and<00:02:03.689> it's<00:02:04.140> not

00:02:04.569 --> 00:02:04.579 
life and serves the purpose and it's not

00:02:04.579 --> 00:02:07.940 
life and serves the purpose and it's not
only<00:02:05.579> although<00:02:06.390> it<00:02:06.509> sometimes<00:02:06.899> designs<00:02:07.590> it<00:02:07.740> as

00:02:07.940 --> 00:02:07.950 
only although it sometimes designs it as

00:02:07.950 --> 00:02:11.470 
only although it sometimes designs it as
well<00:02:08.160> it's<00:02:08.310> not<00:02:08.429> only<00:02:10.190> provoking

00:02:11.470 --> 00:02:11.480 
well it's not only provoking

00:02:11.480 --> 00:02:13.930 
well it's not only provoking
and<00:02:11.830> confronting<00:02:12.830> at<00:02:12.950> with<00:02:13.220> something<00:02:13.550> other

00:02:13.930 --> 00:02:13.940 
and confronting at with something other

00:02:13.940 --> 00:02:16.509

the contemporary sense and show how

00:03:14.780 --> 00:03:16.660 
the contemporary sense and show how
radically<00:03:15.290> different<00:03:15.680> it<00:03:15.769> is<00:03:15.829> and<00:03:16.190> that

radically different it is and that

00:03:16.670 --> 00:03:19.300 
radically different it is and that
design<00:03:17.150> in<00:03:17.450> a<00:03:17.540> sense<00:03:17.810> is<00:03:18.079> something<00:03:18.470> which

00:03:19.300 --> 00:03:19.310 
design in a sense is something which

00:03:19.310 --> 00:03:22.479 
design in a sense is something which
