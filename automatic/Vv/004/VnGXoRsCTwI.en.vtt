00:00:09.590 --> 00:00:15.240
 good more than one you asked me 

00:00:11.940 --> 00:00:17.990
 already in many videos that is what I use 

00:00:15.240 --> 00:00:21.570
 to paint what are the cakes or 

00:00:17.990 --> 00:00:24.060
 to shine the fruits what I use 

00:00:21.570 --> 00:00:26.640
 it's an apple jelly that's used 

00:00:24.060 --> 00:00:28.590
 much in pastry and today I bring you the 

00:00:26.640 --> 00:00:30.779
 recipe to make it let's 

00:00:28.590 --> 00:00:32.730
 need what are skins of 

00:00:30.779 --> 00:00:34.950
 apple and the hearts of apples 

00:00:32.730 --> 00:00:38.460
 well, if you have or have eaten them 

00:00:34.950 --> 00:00:40.860
 at home or you have made some cake 

00:00:38.460 --> 00:00:41.969
 well take advantage of the pine nuts 

00:00:40.860 --> 00:00:46.320
 they are very important because they have 

00:00:41.969 --> 00:00:48.270
 berth and we are interested after water not 

00:00:46.320 --> 00:00:50.879
 I put you amount because as you will see in 

00:00:48.270 --> 00:00:53.760
 the video depends on the song the amount 

00:00:50.879 --> 00:00:57.059
 apple skin 'sugar sugar 

00:00:53.760 --> 00:00:59.520
 it is also orientative and then some 

00:00:57.059 --> 00:01:02.280
 gelatin sheets to stop him giving 

00:00:59.520 --> 00:01:10.320
 a tad more than 

00:01:02.280 --> 00:01:12.750
 of hardness to our gelatine we will begin 

00:01:10.320 --> 00:01:15.840
 putting in a saucepan for all our 

00:01:12.750 --> 00:01:18.690
 skins together with the pine nuts all 

00:01:15.840 --> 00:01:23.119
 and in that same case we will pour water 

00:01:18.690 --> 00:01:23.119
 until the domes the skins 

00:01:30.130 --> 00:01:36.920
 once we have it on fire 

00:01:32.600 --> 00:01:38.450
 covered with the lid we'll leave it 

00:01:36.920 --> 00:01:40.380
 Let the skins boil and stay 

00:01:38.450 --> 00:01:43.619
 soft 

00:01:40.380 --> 00:01:47.689
 As you can see it's already been a little 

00:01:43.619 --> 00:01:51.119
 boiling and what is the apple already 

00:01:47.689 --> 00:01:53.189
 It starts to be soft, we'll leave it 

00:01:51.119 --> 00:01:55.930
 boil a tad more we are also interested 

00:01:53.189 --> 00:01:59.560
 as you can see 

00:01:55.930 --> 00:02:02.500
 what is the liquid the water is a 

00:01:59.560 --> 00:02:04.300
 little bit cloudy because it has already started 

00:02:02.500 --> 00:02:05.950
 started to be everything that is the 

00:02:04.300 --> 00:02:08.050
 pectin and all the substance that is the 

00:02:05.950 --> 00:02:10.090
 that we are interested in , we will leave 

00:02:08.050 --> 00:02:12.910
 Minutitos more and we will remove it from the fire 

00:02:10.090 --> 00:02:15.040
 we have left a couple of minutes more and 

00:02:12.910 --> 00:02:22.209
 Now we're going to remove it from the 

00:02:15.040 --> 00:02:24.310
 fire and we're going to strain it first 

00:02:22.209 --> 00:02:26.020
 we are going to do is to leave what you have 

00:02:24.310 --> 00:02:29.350
 you have a very large very large colander 

00:02:26.020 --> 00:02:31.780
 Well, you can do it directly but 

00:02:29.350 --> 00:02:34.500
 like mine is tiny first 

00:02:31.780 --> 00:02:34.500
 Remove from the skins 

00:02:36.010 --> 00:02:40.620
 the hearts and everything and then strain the 

00:02:38.260 --> 00:02:42.780
 liquid 

00:02:40.620 --> 00:02:44.900
 and once you've already taken everything 

00:02:42.780 --> 00:02:48.890
 that are the stones we still have some 

00:02:44.900 --> 00:02:51.550
 some pinions then 

00:02:48.890 --> 00:02:51.550
 or we will do it 

00:03:02.120 --> 00:03:06.739
 this is the liquid that we 

00:03:04.549 --> 00:03:09.260
 we were looking for our jelly 

00:03:06.739 --> 00:03:11.540
 because this liquid together with the pectin 

00:03:09.260 --> 00:03:14.120
 in contact with the sugar that we are going to 

00:03:11.540 --> 00:03:15.620
 to throw is what that gel is going to do 

00:03:14.120 --> 00:03:17.480
 which is what gives the cakes a shine 

00:03:15.620 --> 00:03:19.670
 so now what we have to do 

00:03:17.480 --> 00:03:22.400
 to do is to see the amount of liquid that 

00:03:19.670 --> 00:03:24.860
 has left us because everything depends on the 

00:03:22.400 --> 00:03:27.470
 amount of skins and so on that you 

00:03:24.860 --> 00:03:29.510
 let's put out a quantity or another but 

00:03:27.470 --> 00:03:32.720
 we will use the same case that we have 

00:03:29.510 --> 00:03:35.230
 used before and let's think how much we 

00:03:32.720 --> 00:03:35.230
 has left 

00:03:38.380 --> 00:03:50.980
 we have left about 700 

00:03:42.270 --> 00:03:54.460
 milliliters then now we have to 

00:03:50.980 --> 00:03:57.850
 make a rule of 3 because it's for every 

00:03:54.460 --> 00:04:00.580
 liter 600 grams of sugar then in this 

00:03:57.850 --> 00:04:02.540
 case we will have to throw 450 grams of 

00:04:00.580 --> 00:04:05.920
 sugar 

00:04:02.540 --> 00:04:05.920
 and we mix it well 

00:04:07.330 --> 00:04:13.300
 and we put it on the fire again and already 

00:04:10.150 --> 00:04:14.110
 it starts to boil but it's still very 

00:04:13.300 --> 00:04:17.139
 liquid 

00:04:14.110 --> 00:04:19.689
 we are interested in remaining 

00:04:17.139 --> 00:04:22.770
 that the liquid is a little more golden 

00:04:19.689 --> 00:04:26.499
 and apart from that we stay as more like 

00:04:22.770 --> 00:04:29.199
 gelatinous good we've been a while 

00:04:26.499 --> 00:04:30.550
 As you can see, it has reduced a lot already 

00:04:29.199 --> 00:04:33.590
 you have that color 

00:04:30.550 --> 00:04:37.490
 well golden and when 

00:04:33.590 --> 00:04:39.080
 we let it fall what is the liquid is 

00:04:37.490 --> 00:04:41.450
 rather thicker 

00:04:39.080 --> 00:04:48.530
 now we will remove it from the fire and 

00:04:41.450 --> 00:04:51.020
 Let cool once removed from the 

00:04:48.530 --> 00:04:54.220
 fire what we are going to do is we will take 

00:04:51.020 --> 00:04:54.220
 a couple of sheets of gelatin 

00:04:55.040 --> 00:05:00.710
 that we have hydrated in cold water and we have 

00:04:58.640 --> 00:05:05.040
 drained well 

00:05:00.710 --> 00:05:07.970
 and we will mix them in our 

00:05:05.040 --> 00:05:07.970
 preparation 

00:05:09.770 --> 00:05:15.009
 so we will have a jelly a little bit 

00:05:12.199 --> 00:05:15.009
 more compact 

00:05:15.180 --> 00:05:20.600
 if you look 

00:05:17.190 --> 00:05:20.600
 it is already much more 

00:05:21.510 --> 00:05:29.090
 gelatinous we will let it cool then 

00:05:25.590 --> 00:05:29.090
 overnight for 12 hours 

00:05:33.210 --> 00:05:39.970
 well we have already had our jelly 

00:05:35.949 --> 00:05:42.400
 of apple all night long outside 

00:05:39.970 --> 00:05:45.610
 so that it does not cool badly and as 

00:05:42.400 --> 00:05:49.289
 you can see if you notice 

00:05:45.610 --> 00:05:51.300
 pretty pretty compact 

00:05:49.289 --> 00:05:55.439
 so we already have our list 

00:05:51.300 --> 00:05:58.999
 gelatin now we will put it in a boat and 

00:05:55.439 --> 00:05:58.999
 we'll leave it in the fridge 

00:06:03.000 --> 00:06:07.680
 and now that we already have it in our 

00:06:04.830 --> 00:06:09.390
 pot we will close it closed with the 

00:06:07.680 --> 00:06:12.990
 cover and we'll leave it in the fridge 

00:06:09.390 --> 00:06:15.630
 especially to make it a bit more 

00:06:12.990 --> 00:06:17.730
 liquid and easier to use what 

00:06:15.630 --> 00:06:21.110
 Warm up a little before painting 

00:06:17.730 --> 00:06:24.360
 our fruits or our cakes and 

00:06:21.110 --> 00:06:26.070
 I hope you liked it especially if 

00:06:24.360 --> 00:06:27.780
 you liked to like it here 

00:06:26.070 --> 00:06:30.800
 of cee and see you in the next 

00:06:27.780 --> 00:06:30.800
 recipe until later
