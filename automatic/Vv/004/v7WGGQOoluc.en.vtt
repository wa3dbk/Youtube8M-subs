00:00:13.339 --> 00:00:13.349 
the plows and salt there's have been

00:00:13.349 --> 00:00:17.330 
the plows and salt there's have been
keeping<00:00:13.590> up<00:00:14.179> but<00:00:15.500> absolutely<00:00:16.500> crazy<00:00:17.100> it's

00:00:17.330 --> 00:00:17.340 
keeping up but absolutely crazy it's

00:00:17.340 --> 00:00:19.640 
keeping up but absolutely crazy it's
like<00:00:17.490> minus<00:00:18.000> 15<00:00:18.510> out<00:00:18.779> right<00:00:19.020> now<00:00:19.230> that's

00:00:19.640 --> 00:00:19.650 
like minus 15 out right now that's

00:00:19.650 --> 00:00:23.450 
like minus 15 out right now that's
Celsius<00:00:20.400> for<00:00:20.670> you<00:00:20.760> Americans<00:00:21.330> I<00:00:22.289> don't<00:00:23.250> know

00:00:23.450 --> 00:00:23.460 
Celsius for you Americans I don't know

00:00:23.460 --> 00:00:29.740 
Celsius for you Americans I don't know
what<00:00:23.609> that<00:00:23.760> isn't<00:00:24.150> Fahrenheit<00:00:24.980> like<00:00:25.980> minus<00:00:27.019> 30

00:00:29.740 --> 00:00:29.750 
what that isn't Fahrenheit like minus 30

00:00:29.750 --> 00:00:34.790 
what that isn't Fahrenheit like minus 30
yeah<00:00:30.750> bloody<00:00:31.260> bloody<00:00:31.949> cold<00:00:32.540> I<00:00:33.540> did<00:00:34.469> get<00:00:34.649> the

00:00:34.790 --> 00:00:34.800 
yeah bloody bloody cold I did get the

00:00:34.800 --> 00:00:37.670 
yeah bloody bloody cold I did get the
chain<00:00:35.070> and<00:00:35.460> sprocket<00:00:36.239> on<00:00:36.360> the<00:00:36.600> quad<00:00:36.870> I<00:00:36.899> did<00:00:37.500> do

00:00:37.670 --> 00:00:37.680 
chain and sprocket on the quad I did do

00:00:37.680 --> 00:00:39.619 
chain and sprocket on the quad I did do
a<00:00:37.710> video<00:00:37.950> of<00:00:38.160> it<00:00:38.399> but<00:00:38.670> this<00:00:39.149> camera<00:00:39.600> only

00:00:39.619 --> 00:00:39.629 
a video of it but this camera only

00:00:39.629 --> 00:00:42.020 
a video of it but this camera only
records<00:00:40.440> 20<00:00:40.950> minutes<00:00:41.250> at<00:00:41.370> a<00:00:41.399> time<00:00:41.730> and<00:00:41.969> the

00:00:42.020 --> 00:00:42.030 
records 20 minutes at a time and the

00:00:42.030 --> 00:00:44.270 
records 20 minutes at a time and the
shuts<00:00:42.270> off<00:00:42.510> so<00:00:42.809> I<00:00:42.840> lost<00:00:43.230> a<00:00:43.500> lot<00:00:43.680> of<00:00:43.860> the<00:00:43.920> footage

00:00:44.270 --> 00:00:44.280 
shuts off so I lost a lot of the footage

00:00:44.280 --> 00:00:47.540 
shuts off so I lost a lot of the footage
kept<00:00:44.910> on<00:00:45.120> how<00:00:45.300> to<00:00:45.360> restart<00:00:45.989> it<00:00:46.140> so<00:00:46.770> what<00:00:47.460> I'm

00:00:47.540 --> 00:00:47.550 
kept on how to restart it so what I'm

00:00:47.550 --> 00:00:48.529 
kept on how to restart it so what I'm
going<00:00:47.700> to<00:00:47.730> do<00:00:47.879> is<00:00:48.000> I'm<00:00:48.120> going<00:00:48.210> to<00:00:48.270> pull<00:00:48.420> the

00:00:48.529 --> 00:00:48.539 
going to do is I'm going to pull the

00:00:48.539 --> 00:00:53.020 
going to do is I'm going to pull the
four-wheeler<00:00:49.079> out<00:00:49.289> and<00:00:49.590> then<00:00:50.750> just<00:00:51.750> get<00:00:51.930> a

00:00:53.020 --> 00:00:53.030 
four-wheeler out and then just get a

00:00:53.030 --> 00:00:55.819 
four-wheeler out and then just get a
just<00:00:54.030> kind<00:00:54.180> of<00:00:54.300> go<00:00:54.480> over<00:00:54.510> everything<00:00:55.230> I<00:00:55.500> had<00:00:55.680> to

00:00:55.819 --> 00:00:55.829 
just kind of go over everything I had to

00:00:55.829 --> 00:00:57.510 
just kind of go over everything I had to
do<00:00:55.980> to<00:00:56.219> change

00:00:57.510 --> 00:00:57.520 
do to change

00:00:57.520 --> 00:01:00.180 
do to change
but<00:00:58.180> this<00:00:58.510> video<00:00:58.900> is<00:00:58.990> about<00:00:59.230> saving<00:00:59.920> energy

00:01:00.180 --> 00:01:00.190 
but this video is about saving energy

00:01:00.190 --> 00:01:04.070 
but this video is about saving energy
and<00:01:01.230> this<00:01:02.230> is<00:01:02.470> what<00:01:02.650> I<00:01:02.680> do<00:01:02.800> in<00:01:03.070> the<00:01:03.160> winter<00:01:03.430> time

00:01:04.070 --> 00:01:04.080 
and this is what I do in the winter time

00:01:04.080 --> 00:01:08.310 
and this is what I do in the winter time
guys<00:01:05.080> now<00:01:05.760> as<00:01:06.760> you<00:01:06.940> can<00:01:07.060> tell<00:01:07.240> by<00:01:07.420> the<00:01:07.480> fog<00:01:07.930> and

00:01:08.310 --> 00:01:08.320 
guys now as you can tell by the fog and

00:01:08.320 --> 00:01:13.050 
guys now as you can tell by the fog and
the<00:01:08.380> window<00:01:09.030> my<00:01:10.030> window<00:01:10.060> suck<00:01:10.930> so<00:01:12.030> what<00:01:13.030> I

00:01:13.050 --> 00:01:13.060 
the window my window suck so what I

00:01:13.060 --> 00:01:16.200 
the window my window suck so what I
do<00:01:13.210> to<00:01:13.570> save<00:01:14.350> energy

00:01:16.200 --> 00:01:16.210 
do to save energy

00:01:16.210 --> 00:01:18.960 
do to save energy
with<00:01:16.870> the<00:01:17.020> windows<00:01:17.470> I<00:01:17.770> use<00:01:18.100> the<00:01:18.280> curtains<00:01:18.760> to

00:01:18.960 --> 00:01:18.970 
with the windows I use the curtains to

00:01:18.970 --> 00:01:23.100 
with the windows I use the curtains to
actually<00:01:19.479> keep<00:01:19.750> the<00:01:19.960> heat<00:01:20.350> in<00:01:20.650> the<00:01:20.920> house<00:01:22.110> as

00:01:23.100 --> 00:01:23.110 
actually keep the heat in the house as

00:01:23.110 --> 00:01:27.330 
actually keep the heat in the house as
you<00:01:23.290> can<00:01:23.440> tell<00:01:23.680> I<00:01:24.030> took<00:01:25.030> the<00:01:25.330> curtains<00:01:26.229> just<00:01:26.619> on

00:01:27.330 --> 00:01:27.340 
you can tell I took the curtains just on

you can tell I took the curtains just on
the<00:01:27.490> ledge<00:01:27.760> here<00:01:28.240> because<00:01:29.050> if<00:01:29.440> you<00:01:29.470> keep<00:01:29.800> it

00:01:29.999 --> 00:01:30.009 
the ledge here because if you keep it

00:01:30.009 --> 00:01:34.260 
the ledge here because if you keep it
down<00:01:30.420> like<00:01:31.420> that<00:01:31.560> the<00:01:32.560> heat<00:01:32.830> rises<00:01:33.190> and<00:01:33.790> just

00:01:34.260 --> 00:01:34.270 
down like that the heat rises and just

00:01:34.270 --> 00:01:37.290 
down like that the heat rises and just
comes<00:01:34.570> up<00:01:34.840> and<00:01:35.110> you<00:01:35.619> lose<00:01:35.890> a<00:01:35.920> lot<00:01:36.250> of<00:01:36.430> the<00:01:36.520> heat

00:01:37.290 --> 00:01:37.300 
comes up and you lose a lot of the heat

00:01:37.300 --> 00:01:41.160 
comes up and you lose a lot of the heat
well<00:01:37.630> these<00:01:38.080> crappy<00:01:38.619> windows<00:01:39.149> so<00:01:40.149> that's<00:01:40.960> what

00:01:41.160 --> 00:01:41.170 
well these crappy windows so that's what

well these crappy windows so that's what
I<00:01:41.200> do<00:01:41.350> to<00:01:41.770> save<00:01:42.520> energy<00:01:42.759> going<00:01:43.330> out<00:01:43.570> the<00:01:43.780> window

00:01:44.130 --> 00:01:44.140 
I do to save energy going out the window

00:01:44.140 --> 00:01:47.880 
I do to save energy going out the window
just<00:01:45.450> tucking<00:01:46.450> it<00:01:46.720> up<00:01:46.840> like<00:01:47.080> that<00:01:47.110> keeps<00:01:47.680> the

00:01:47.880 --> 00:01:47.890 
just tucking it up like that keeps the

00:01:47.890 --> 00:01:51.719 
just tucking it up like that keeps the
heat<00:01:48.210> from<00:01:49.210> actually<00:01:50.009> hiding<00:01:51.009> in<00:01:51.160> behind<00:01:51.490> the

00:01:51.719 --> 00:01:51.729 
heat from actually hiding in behind the

00:01:51.729 --> 00:01:55.350 
heat from actually hiding in behind the
and<00:01:52.180> behind<00:01:52.990> the<00:01:53.110> curtains<00:01:53.640> so<00:01:54.640> and<00:01:55.000> at<00:01:55.149> night

and behind the curtains so and at night

00:01:55.360 --> 00:01:58.740 
and behind the curtains so and at night
time<00:01:55.600> I<00:01:55.630> close<00:01:55.960> them<00:01:56.140> up<00:01:56.259> anyway<00:01:56.680> so<00:01:56.710> I<00:01:57.750> already

00:01:58.740 --> 00:01:58.750 
time I close them up anyway so I already

00:01:58.750 --> 00:02:02.340 
time I close them up anyway so I already
that's<00:01:59.080> one<00:02:00.420> there's<00:02:01.420> another<00:02:01.569> way<00:02:01.929> I<00:02:01.959> save

00:02:02.340 --> 00:02:02.350 
that's one there's another way I save

00:02:02.350 --> 00:02:04.859 
that's one there's another way I save
energy<00:02:02.619> and<00:02:03.130> actually<00:02:04.030> make<00:02:04.509> the<00:02:04.660> house<00:02:04.840> more

00:02:04.859 --> 00:02:04.869 
energy and actually make the house more

00:02:04.869 --> 00:02:08.219 
energy and actually make the house more
comfortable<00:02:06.149> do<00:02:07.149> my<00:02:07.330> laundry<00:02:07.539> in<00:02:07.840> the<00:02:07.959> tub

comfortable do my laundry in the tub

00:02:08.229 --> 00:02:09.960 
comfortable do my laundry in the tub
saves<00:02:08.649> me<00:02:08.890> going<00:02:09.160> to<00:02:09.250> the<00:02:09.369> laundromat<00:02:09.940> and

00:02:09.960 --> 00:02:09.970 
saves me going to the laundromat and

00:02:09.970 --> 00:02:13.620 
saves me going to the laundromat and
spending<00:02:10.569> a<00:02:10.660> fortune<00:02:11.400> and<00:02:12.400> they<00:02:12.850> hang<00:02:13.209> it<00:02:13.450> I

00:02:13.620 --> 00:02:13.630 
spending a fortune and they hang it I

00:02:13.630 --> 00:02:16.980 
spending a fortune and they hang it I
got<00:02:13.990> a<00:02:14.020> wire<00:02:14.290> here<00:02:14.709> hung<00:02:15.310> across<00:02:15.690> my<00:02:16.690> hanging

00:02:16.980 --> 00:02:16.990 
got a wire here hung across my hanging

00:02:16.990 --> 00:02:20.940 
got a wire here hung across my hanging
right<00:02:17.410> above<00:02:17.470> a<00:02:17.800> heat<00:02:18.040> register<00:02:19.620> not<00:02:20.620> only

00:02:20.940 --> 00:02:20.950 
right above a heat register not only

00:02:20.950 --> 00:02:24.120 
right above a heat register not only
does<00:02:21.190> it<00:02:21.750> not<00:02:22.750> only<00:02:22.900> does<00:02:23.260> it<00:02:23.410> dry<00:02:23.620> the<00:02:23.680> clothes

00:02:24.120 --> 00:02:24.130 
does it not only does it dry the clothes

00:02:24.130 --> 00:02:28.380 
does it not only does it dry the clothes
but<00:02:24.910> it<00:02:25.270> humidifies<00:02:26.140> the<00:02:26.440> air<00:02:27.120> so<00:02:28.120> it's

00:02:28.380 --> 00:02:28.390 
but it humidifies the air so it's

00:02:28.390 --> 00:02:30.210 
but it humidifies the air so it's
actually<00:02:28.780> warmer<00:02:29.290> and<00:02:29.410> the<00:02:29.530> house<00:02:29.740> and

00:02:30.210 --> 00:02:30.220 
actually warmer and the house and

00:02:30.220 --> 00:02:33.059 
actually warmer and the house and
because<00:02:31.030> of<00:02:31.060> the<00:02:31.180> fabric<00:02:31.599> softener<00:02:32.140> it

force their gas and how I do that is the

00:02:54.880 --> 00:02:56.940 
force their gas and how I do that is the
register<00:02:55.390> on<00:02:55.540> the<00:02:55.690> floor<00:02:55.959> pretend<00:02:56.650> this<00:02:56.770> is

00:02:59.880 --> 00:02:59.890 
register register on the floor I'd pull

00:02:59.890 --> 00:03:02.760 
register register on the floor I'd pull
it<00:03:00.040> out<00:03:00.220> I<00:03:00.489> put<00:03:00.910> a<00:03:00.970> garbage<00:03:01.330> bag<00:03:01.750> lay<00:03:02.500> it<00:03:02.650> out

00:03:02.760 --> 00:03:02.770 
it out I put a garbage bag lay it out

00:03:02.770 --> 00:03:06.900 
it out I put a garbage bag lay it out
flat<00:03:03.010> I<00:03:03.489> cut<00:03:04.150> out<00:03:04.180> the<00:03:05.340> register<00:03:06.340> hole<00:03:06.550> put<00:03:06.880> the

flat I cut out the register hole put the
register<00:03:07.510> back<00:03:07.750> in<00:03:08.110> then<00:03:08.560> I<00:03:08.680> put<00:03:08.890> a<00:03:08.920> chair

00:03:09.890 --> 00:03:09.900 
register back in then I put a chair

00:03:09.900 --> 00:03:11.630 
register back in then I put a chair
on<00:03:09.930> either<00:03:10.079> side<00:03:10.260> of<00:03:10.530> the<00:03:10.769> register<00:03:11.370> with<00:03:11.610> a

on either side of the register with a
broom<00:03:12.030> handle<00:03:12.060> across<00:03:12.870> then<00:03:13.620> I'd<00:03:13.829> hang<00:03:14.129> the

00:03:14.330 --> 00:03:14.340 
broom handle across then I'd hang the

00:03:14.340 --> 00:03:18.170 
broom handle across then I'd hang the
clothes<00:03:14.640> right<00:03:15.180> above<00:03:15.390> the<00:03:15.569> register<00:03:16.549> so<00:03:17.549> it's

00:03:18.170 --> 00:03:18.180 
clothes right above the register so it's

00:03:18.180 --> 00:03:21.589 
clothes right above the register so it's
just<00:03:18.299> a<00:03:18.420> couple<00:03:18.629> ways<00:03:18.870> to<00:03:20.090> show<00:03:21.090> you<00:03:21.180> guys<00:03:21.360> how

00:03:21.589 --> 00:03:21.599 
just a couple ways to show you guys how

00:03:21.599 --> 00:03:23.569 
just a couple ways to show you guys how
to<00:03:21.629> save<00:03:21.989> a<00:03:22.019> better<00:03:22.319> energy<00:03:22.620> and<00:03:23.099> money<00:03:23.250> in<00:03:23.459> the

00:03:23.569 --> 00:03:23.579 
to save a better energy and money in the

00:03:23.579 --> 00:03:26.649 
to save a better energy and money in the
winter<00:03:23.849> time<00:03:24.030> because<00:03:24.769> you<00:03:25.769> know<00:03:25.890> it's<00:03:26.220> winter

00:03:26.649 --> 00:03:26.659 
winter time because you know it's winter

00:03:26.659 --> 00:03:29.599 
winter time because you know it's winter
heating<00:03:27.659> costs<00:03:28.170> are<00:03:28.319> crazy<00:03:28.590> so<00:03:29.220> you<00:03:29.250> might<00:03:29.519> as

00:03:29.599 --> 00:03:29.609 
heating costs are crazy so you might as

00:03:29.609 --> 00:03:32.899 
heating costs are crazy so you might as
well<00:03:29.989> extend<00:03:30.989> the<00:03:31.200> use<00:03:31.439> of<00:03:31.739> having<00:03:32.489> to<00:03:32.730> heat

00:03:32.899 --> 00:03:32.909 
well extend the use of having to heat

00:03:32.909 --> 00:03:36.319 
well extend the use of having to heat
the<00:03:33.090> place<00:03:33.349> so<00:03:34.349> it's<00:03:34.680> actually<00:03:35.519> really<00:03:36.060> nice

00:03:36.319 --> 00:03:36.329 
the place so it's actually really nice

00:03:36.329 --> 00:03:39.559 
the place so it's actually really nice
in<00:03:36.599> here<00:03:36.780> it's<00:03:36.989> still<00:03:37.109> like<00:03:37.670> 19<00:03:38.670> degrees<00:03:38.849> I

00:03:39.559 --> 00:03:39.569 
in here it's still like 19 degrees I

00:03:39.569 --> 00:03:43.849 
in here it's still like 19 degrees I
think<00:03:40.489> you<00:03:41.489> know<00:03:41.659> it's<00:03:42.659> almost<00:03:42.780> 20<00:03:43.230> degrees<00:03:43.590> in

00:03:43.849 --> 00:03:43.859 
think you know it's almost 20 degrees in

00:03:43.859 --> 00:03:48.800 
think you know it's almost 20 degrees in
here<00:03:44.099> and<00:03:45.000> it's<00:03:46.519> humid<00:03:47.519> you<00:03:47.940> know<00:03:47.970> like<00:03:48.659> I

00:03:48.800 --> 00:03:48.810 
here and it's humid you know like I

00:03:48.810 --> 00:03:51.170 
here and it's humid you know like I
would<00:03:48.959> say<00:03:49.170> really<00:03:49.560> humid<00:03:49.920> but<00:03:50.099> at<00:03:50.370> least<00:03:50.639> it's

00:03:51.170 --> 00:03:51.180 
would say really humid but at least it's

00:03:51.180 --> 00:03:54.770 
would say really humid but at least it's
not<00:03:51.269> a<00:03:51.420> dry<00:03:51.840> air<00:03:52.260> all<00:03:53.040> right<00:03:53.250> so<00:03:54.030> there's<00:03:54.659> a

00:03:54.770 --> 00:03:54.780 
not a dry air all right so there's a

00:03:54.780 --> 00:03:57.339 
not a dry air all right so there's a
couple<00:03:54.989> of<00:03:55.290> energy-saving<00:03:55.920> ideas<00:03:56.700> guys

00:03:57.339 --> 00:03:57.349 
couple of energy-saving ideas guys

00:03:57.349 --> 00:03:58.599 
couple of energy-saving ideas guys
Cheers

00:03:58.599 --> 00:03:58.609
