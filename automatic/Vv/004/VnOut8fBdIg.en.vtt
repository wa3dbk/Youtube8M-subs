00:00:07.917 --> 00:00:10.400
 Welcome to the Aqua Terra series of video guides 

00:00:11.443 --> 00:00:13.606
 Crown on the side edge of the watch 

00:00:13.726 --> 00:00:15.478
 Can be used to set the time 

00:00:15.598 --> 00:00:17.695
 And adjusting the time and date of the off-site 

00:00:17.815 --> 00:00:19.604
 The position of the crown when it is normally worn 

00:00:19.724 --> 00:00:22.558
 Ensure that the watch is completely waterproof 

00:00:22.678 --> 00:00:25.914
 The crown must be rotated backwards before setting the time. 

00:00:26.206 --> 00:00:27.861
 Although the watch can be automatically wound 

00:00:27.981 --> 00:00:29.708
 But when the crown is in this position 

00:00:29.828 --> 00:00:31.929
 Can be rotated forward to add power 

00:00:35.261 --> 00:00:36.408
 To set the time 

00:00:36.528 --> 00:00:39.587
 Pull the crown out until you hear two clicks 

00:00:40.526 --> 00:00:42.445
 The second hand will stop moving 

00:00:43.613 --> 00:00:45.658
 Rotate the crown forward or backward 

00:00:45.778 --> 00:00:48.989
 Move the hour and minute hands to the desired time 

00:00:55.432 --> 00:00:57.330
 You can easily adjust the time zone 

00:00:57.450 --> 00:00:59.625
 Convenient for you to adapt to the time difference of travel 

00:00:59.745 --> 00:01:01.305
 Pull the crown out to position 2 

00:01:01.425 --> 00:01:04.338
 Rotate forward or backward to move the hour hand 

00:01:04.458 --> 00:01:07.624
 This does not affect the operation of the minute hand and the second hand 

00:01:10.092 --> 00:01:11.636
 To adjust the date forward 

00:01:11.756 --> 00:01:14.567
 Move the hour hand forward and pass at 12 o'clock midnight 

00:01:16.017 --> 00:01:17.613
 To adjust the date later 

00:01:17.733 --> 00:01:21.711
 Move the hour hand backwards and pass 7 pm to ensure the change takes effect 

00:01:25.866 --> 00:01:29.235
 To re-lock the crown, first make sure the crown is in position 1. 

00:01:30.097 --> 00:01:33.434
 Then press firmly and rotate in a clockwise direction 

00:01:37.977 --> 00:01:40.220
 To facilitate reading time in dimly lit environments 

00:01:40.340 --> 00:01:42.191
 Pointer and scale of the watch 

00:01:42.311 --> 00:01:45.823
 Both are exposed by a luminous coating to give a blue glow 

00:01:50.725 --> 00:01:52.739
 Thank you for watching this video guide. 

00:01:52.859 --> 00:01:55.106
 I hope you like your Aqua Terra watch.
