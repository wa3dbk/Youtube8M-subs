00:00:06.620 --> 00:00:10.869 

yeah<00:00:07.609> I<00:00:07.670> don't<00:00:07.850> know<00:00:08.090> if<00:00:08.420> we<00:00:08.900> would<00:00:09.760> you<00:00:10.760> know

00:00:10.869 --> 00:00:10.879 
yeah I don't know if we would you know

00:00:10.879 --> 00:00:12.970 
yeah I don't know if we would you know
in<00:00:11.090> a<00:00:11.150> vacuum<00:00:11.389> I<00:00:11.780> don't<00:00:11.930> necessarily<00:00:12.469> know

00:00:12.970 --> 00:00:12.980 
in a vacuum I don't necessarily know

00:00:12.980 --> 00:00:15.490 
in a vacuum I don't necessarily know
that<00:00:13.010> we<00:00:13.250> would<00:00:13.400> be<00:00:13.549> doing<00:00:13.820> this<00:00:14.120> yeah<00:00:14.750> I<00:00:15.049> think

00:00:15.490 --> 00:00:15.500 
that we would be doing this yeah I think

00:00:15.500 --> 00:00:17.640 
that we would be doing this yeah I think
it's<00:00:15.860> that<00:00:16.129> feeling<00:00:16.640> that<00:00:16.760> we've<00:00:16.940> had

00:00:17.640 --> 00:00:17.650 
it's that feeling that we've had

00:00:17.650 --> 00:00:22.420 
it's that feeling that we've had
throughout<00:00:18.650> for<00:00:19.150> for<00:00:20.859> since<00:00:21.859> the<00:00:22.039> band<00:00:22.220> broke

00:00:22.420 --> 00:00:22.430 
throughout for for since the band broke

00:00:22.430 --> 00:00:25.900 
throughout for for since the band broke
up<00:00:22.669> really<00:00:23.089> just<00:00:23.720> a<00:00:23.869> sense<00:00:24.169> that<00:00:24.410> those<00:00:24.910> people

00:00:25.900 --> 00:00:25.910 
up really just a sense that those people

00:00:25.910 --> 00:00:29.819 
up really just a sense that those people
that<00:00:26.029> are<00:00:26.089> still<00:00:26.480> interested<00:00:27.380> that<00:00:28.689> genuinely

00:00:29.819 --> 00:00:29.829 
that are still interested that genuinely

00:00:29.829 --> 00:00:34.090 
that are still interested that genuinely
love<00:00:30.829> the<00:00:31.009> music<00:00:31.460> and<00:00:32.380> and<00:00:33.380> I<00:00:33.500> think<00:00:33.740> that<00:00:33.920> was

00:00:34.090 --> 00:00:34.100 
love the music and and I think that was

00:00:34.100 --> 00:00:36.640 
love the music and and I think that was
that<00:00:34.310> was<00:00:34.730> the<00:00:34.760> main<00:00:35.060> impetus<00:00:35.440> that<00:00:36.440> was<00:00:36.530> the

00:00:36.640 --> 00:00:36.650 
that was the main impetus that was the

00:00:36.650 --> 00:00:38.530 
that was the main impetus that was the
exciting<00:00:36.920> thing<00:00:37.280> about<00:00:37.310> doing<00:00:37.880> it<00:00:38.030> because<00:00:38.390> so

00:00:38.530 --> 00:00:38.540 
exciting thing about doing it because so

00:00:38.540 --> 00:00:42.280 
exciting thing about doing it because so
it's<00:00:38.750> just<00:00:40.000> it's<00:00:41.000> almost<00:00:41.180> an<00:00:41.330> obligation<00:00:41.480> in<00:00:42.230> a

00:00:42.280 --> 00:00:42.290 
it's just it's almost an obligation in a

00:00:42.290 --> 00:00:45.430 
it's just it's almost an obligation in a
way<00:00:42.440> I<00:00:42.470> feel<00:00:42.860> like<00:00:43.100> yeah<00:00:43.700> because<00:00:44.030> when<00:00:44.180> we<00:00:44.440> we

00:00:45.430 --> 00:00:45.440 
way I feel like yeah because when we we

00:00:45.440 --> 00:00:47.620 
way I feel like yeah because when we we
might<00:00:45.560> be<00:00:45.740> doing<00:00:45.890> music<00:00:46.130> together<00:00:46.540> but<00:00:47.540> it

00:00:47.620 --> 00:00:47.630 
might be doing music together but it

00:00:47.630 --> 00:00:50.080 
might be doing music together but it
probably<00:00:47.870> wouldn't<00:00:48.350> be<00:00:48.560> the<00:00:49.100> failure<00:00:49.640> sound

00:00:50.080 --> 00:00:50.090 
probably wouldn't be the failure sound

00:00:50.090 --> 00:00:54.430 
probably wouldn't be the failure sound
per<00:00:50.330> se<00:00:50.570> but<00:00:52.150> because<00:00:53.150> the<00:00:53.510> interest<00:00:54.110> in<00:00:54.320> the

00:00:54.430 --> 00:00:54.440 
per se but because the interest in the

00:00:54.440 --> 00:00:56.710 
per se but because the interest in the
band<00:00:54.650> has<00:00:54.860> actually<00:00:55.370> grown<00:00:55.610> since<00:00:56.360> we<00:00:56.540> broke

00:00:56.710 --> 00:00:56.720 
band has actually grown since we broke

00:00:56.720 --> 00:01:00.520 
band has actually grown since we broke
up<00:00:56.900> in<00:00:57.080> 97<00:00:57.770> we<00:00:58.400> kind<00:00:58.580> of<00:00:58.640> felt<00:00:58.820> like<00:00:58.910> hit<00:00:59.530> let's

00:01:00.520 --> 00:01:00.530 
up in 97 we kind of felt like hit let's

00:01:00.530 --> 00:01:03.850 
up in 97 we kind of felt like hit let's
do<00:01:00.680> failure<00:01:01.040> yeah<00:01:01.750> it<00:01:02.750> was<00:01:02.930> when<00:01:03.350> we<00:01:03.500> came<00:01:03.530> out

00:01:03.850 --> 00:01:03.860 
do failure yeah it was when we came out

00:01:03.860 --> 00:01:06.249 
do failure yeah it was when we came out
it<00:01:04.009> was<00:01:04.100> very<00:01:04.549> I<00:01:04.909> was<00:01:05.269> all<00:01:05.420> about<00:01:05.600> grunge<00:01:05.930> and

00:01:06.249 --> 00:01:06.259 
it was very I was all about grunge and

00:01:06.259 --> 00:01:09.670 
it was very I was all about grunge and
Pearl<00:01:06.920> Jam<00:01:07.220> and<00:01:07.250> Nirvana<00:01:07.729> and<00:01:08.119> I<00:01:08.900> think<00:01:09.229> bars

00:01:09.670 --> 00:01:09.680 
Pearl Jam and Nirvana and I think bars

00:01:09.680 --> 00:01:14.139 
Pearl Jam and Nirvana and I think bars
sound<00:01:10.450> it<00:01:11.450> didn't<00:01:12.219> check<00:01:13.219> all<00:01:13.460> the<00:01:13.640> boxes<00:01:14.090> for

00:01:14.139 --> 00:01:14.149 
sound it didn't check all the boxes for

00:01:14.149 --> 00:01:17.620 
sound it didn't check all the boxes for
grunge<00:01:14.630> and<00:01:15.070> so<00:01:16.070> it<00:01:16.520> was<00:01:16.700> a<00:01:16.729> bit<00:01:17.210> of<00:01:17.299> a<00:01:17.390> problem

00:01:17.620 --> 00:01:17.630 
grunge and so it was a bit of a problem

00:01:17.630 --> 00:01:19.060 
grunge and so it was a bit of a problem
was<00:01:17.990> kind<00:01:18.170> of<00:01:18.259> like<00:01:18.380> well<00:01:18.590> it<00:01:18.649> doesn't<00:01:18.829> quite

00:01:19.060 --> 00:01:19.070 
was kind of like well it doesn't quite

00:01:19.070 --> 00:01:22.719 
was kind of like well it doesn't quite
fit<00:01:19.310> so<00:01:19.479> we're<00:01:20.479> not<00:01:20.689> too<00:01:21.380> sure<00:01:21.409> about<00:01:21.799> how<00:01:22.340> this

00:01:22.719 --> 00:01:22.729 
fit so we're not too sure about how this

00:01:22.729 --> 00:01:24.609 
fit so we're not too sure about how this
is<00:01:22.999> gonna<00:01:23.179> work<00:01:23.479> in<00:01:23.810> this<00:01:23.899> environment<00:01:24.049> and

00:01:24.609 --> 00:01:24.619 
is gonna work in this environment and

00:01:24.619 --> 00:01:27.039 
is gonna work in this environment and
now<00:01:25.460> that<00:01:25.729> that's<00:01:25.850> all<00:01:26.060> passed<00:01:26.420> and<00:01:26.869> people

00:01:27.039 --> 00:01:27.049 
now that that's all passed and people

00:01:27.049 --> 00:01:30.459 
now that that's all passed and people
are<00:01:27.319> just<00:01:28.179> experiencing<00:01:29.179> the<00:01:29.299> album<00:01:29.630> for<00:01:30.289> what

00:01:30.459 --> 00:01:30.469

are just experiencing the album for what
it<00:01:30.560> is<00:01:30.590> and<00:01:31.100> not<00:01:31.729> trying<00:01:32.210> to<00:01:32.420> compare<00:01:32.780> it<00:01:32.899> to

00:01:33.010 --> 00:01:33.020 
it is and not trying to compare it to

00:01:33.020 --> 00:01:35.889 
it is and not trying to compare it to
other<00:01:33.170> bands<00:01:33.549> it<00:01:34.549> feels<00:01:34.850> just<00:01:35.149> better<00:01:35.659> down

00:01:35.889 --> 00:01:35.899

basically<00:02:16.239> being<00:02:16.450> involved<00:02:16.870> because<00:02:17.140> the<00:02:17.590> the

00:02:18.420 --> 00:02:18.430 
basically being involved because the the

00:02:18.430 --> 00:02:20.460 
basically being involved because the the
demos<00:02:18.910> for<00:02:19.150> the<00:02:19.239> second<00:02:19.660> record<00:02:19.810> magnified

00:02:20.460 --> 00:02:20.470 
demos for the second record magnified

00:02:20.470 --> 00:02:22.860 
demos for the second record magnified
they<00:02:21.310> actually<00:02:21.790> wanted<00:02:22.060> to<00:02:22.120> release<00:02:22.540> that

00:02:22.860 --> 00:02:22.870 
they actually wanted to release that

00:02:22.870 --> 00:02:26.520 
they actually wanted to release that
instead<00:02:23.500> of<00:02:23.709> the<00:02:24.010> finished<00:02:24.430> album<00:02:25.530> because

00:02:26.520 --> 00:02:26.530 
instead of the finished album because

00:02:26.530 --> 00:02:27.780 
instead of the finished album because
they<00:02:26.680> thought<00:02:26.829> the<00:02:26.980> finished<00:02:27.250> album<00:02:27.430> sounded

00:02:27.780 --> 00:02:27.790 
they thought the finished album sounded

00:02:27.790 --> 00:02:29.789 
they thought the finished album sounded
a<00:02:27.849> little<00:02:28.000> too<00:02:28.120> produced<00:02:28.720> and<00:02:29.170> they<00:02:29.560> thought

00:02:29.789 --> 00:02:29.799 
a little too produced and they thought

00:02:29.799 --> 00:02:33.690 
a little too produced and they thought
the<00:02:30.099> demos<00:02:30.459> were<00:02:30.610> more<00:02:30.790> interesting<00:02:31.360> you<00:02:32.700> know

00:02:33.690 --> 00:02:33.700 
the demos were more interesting you know

00:02:33.700 --> 00:02:36.089 
the demos were more interesting you know
we<00:02:33.910> work<00:02:34.180> we<00:02:34.720> kind<00:02:34.959> of<00:02:35.049> had<00:02:35.170> a<00:02:35.200> cringe<00:02:35.650> factor

00:02:36.089 --> 00:02:36.099 
we work we kind of had a cringe factor

00:02:36.099 --> 00:02:37.920 
we work we kind of had a cringe factor
with<00:02:36.459> the<00:02:36.579> demos<00:02:36.910> because<00:02:37.030> they<00:02:37.269> had<00:02:37.450> a<00:02:37.480> de<00:02:37.900> a

00:02:37.920 --> 00:02:37.930 
with the demos because they had a de a

00:02:37.930 --> 00:02:41.130 
with the demos because they had a de a
drum<00:02:38.319> machine<00:02:38.440> which<00:02:39.190> we<00:02:39.400> always<00:02:40.079> intended<00:02:41.079> to

00:02:41.130 --> 00:02:41.140 
drum machine which we always intended to

00:02:41.140 --> 00:02:43.740 
drum machine which we always intended to
be<00:02:41.230> replaced<00:02:41.769> by<00:02:41.950> real<00:02:42.129> drum<00:02:42.430> kit<00:02:42.670> but<00:02:43.599> the

00:02:43.740 --> 00:02:43.750 
be replaced by real drum kit but the

00:02:43.750 --> 00:02:47.100 
be replaced by real drum kit but the
other<00:02:43.930> sounds<00:02:44.790> were<00:02:45.790> kind<00:02:46.150> of<00:02:46.239> more<00:02:46.510> special

00:02:47.100 --> 00:02:47.110 
other sounds were kind of more special

00:02:47.110 --> 00:02:49.199 
other sounds were kind of more special
in<00:02:47.260> a<00:02:47.349> way<00:02:47.379> so<00:02:47.560> I<00:02:47.860> get<00:02:48.160> where<00:02:48.760> they<00:02:48.880> were<00:02:48.940> coming

00:02:49.199 --> 00:02:49.209 
in a way so I get where they were coming

00:02:49.209 --> 00:02:50.550 
in a way so I get where they were coming
from<00:02:49.389> so<00:02:49.480> when<00:02:49.750> it<00:02:49.840> came<00:02:49.959> time<00:02:50.139> to<00:02:50.230> make<00:02:50.350> the

00:02:50.550 --> 00:02:50.560 
from so when it came time to make the

00:02:50.560 --> 00:02:52.080 
from so when it came time to make the
third<00:02:50.709> record<00:02:51.069> they<00:02:51.190> were<00:02:51.250> just<00:02:51.489> like<00:02:51.670> you

00:02:52.080 --> 00:02:52.090 
third record they were just like you

00:02:52.090 --> 00:02:54.569 
third record they were just like you
want<00:02:52.239> to<00:02:52.299> make<00:02:52.420> it<00:02:52.540> on<00:02:52.840> your<00:02:53.049> own<00:02:53.170> go<00:02:53.440> ahead<00:02:53.680> so

00:02:54.569 --> 00:02:54.579 
want to make it on your own go ahead so

00:02:54.579 --> 00:02:57.650 
want to make it on your own go ahead so
they<00:02:54.850> did<00:02:55.660> give<00:02:56.319> us<00:02:56.440> total<00:02:56.650> creative<00:02:57.040> freedom

00:02:57.650 --> 00:02:57.660 
they did give us total creative freedom

00:02:57.660 --> 00:03:00.059 
they did give us total creative freedom
however<00:02:58.660> when<00:02:58.930> we<00:02:59.049> turned<00:02:59.350> in<00:02:59.530> the<00:02:59.680> record

00:03:00.059 --> 00:03:00.069 
however when we turned in the record

00:03:00.069 --> 00:03:02.729 
however when we turned in the record
they<00:03:01.000> were<00:03:01.120> actually<00:03:02.109> everything<00:03:02.620> had

00:03:02.729 --> 00:03:02.739 
they were actually everything had

00:03:02.739 --> 00:03:04.080 
they were actually everything had
changed<00:03:02.769> there<00:03:03.280> because<00:03:03.549> they<00:03:03.760> were<00:03:03.819> trying

00:03:04.080 --> 00:03:04.090 
changed there because they were trying

00:03:04.090 --> 00:03:07.110 
changed there because they were trying
to<00:03:04.150> sell<00:03:04.420> their<00:03:04.630> label<00:03:05.019> so<00:03:05.769> we<00:03:06.519> went<00:03:06.730> into<00:03:06.850> this

00:03:07.110 --> 00:03:07.120 
to sell their label so we went into this

00:03:07.120 --> 00:03:09.840 
to sell their label so we went into this
whole<00:03:07.420> basic<00:03:08.380> freefall<00:03:09.010> of<00:03:09.220> like<00:03:09.400> not<00:03:09.670> even

00:03:09.840 --> 00:03:09.850 
whole basic freefall of like not even

00:03:09.850 --> 00:03:12.090 
whole basic freefall of like not even
knowing<00:03:10.319> if<00:03:11.319> the<00:03:11.440> record<00:03:11.709> was<00:03:11.829> ever<00:03:11.980> gonna

00:03:12.090 --> 00:03:12.100 
knowing if the record was ever gonna

00:03:12.100 --> 00:03:14.069 
knowing if the record was ever gonna
come<00:03:12.340> out<00:03:12.519> who<00:03:12.910> was<00:03:13.120> gonna<00:03:13.239> put<00:03:13.540> it<00:03:13.630> out<00:03:13.750> I

00:03:14.069 --> 00:03:14.079 
come out who was gonna put it out I

00:03:14.079 --> 00:03:16.740 
come out who was gonna put it out I
lasted<00:03:14.709> for<00:03:14.920> a<00:03:14.950> year<00:03:15.010> and<00:03:15.220> a<00:03:15.280> half<00:03:15.459> but<00:03:16.389> that's

00:03:16.740 --> 00:03:16.750 
lasted for a year and a half but that's

00:03:16.750 --> 00:03:18.509 
lasted for a year and a half but that's
why<00:03:17.049> this<00:03:17.109> whole<00:03:17.530> thing<00:03:17.560> feels<00:03:17.950> so<00:03:18.250> good<00:03:18.489> right

00:03:18.509 --> 00:03:18.519 
why this whole thing feels so good right

00:03:18.519 --> 00:03:22.080 
why this whole thing feels so good right
now<00:03:18.810> it<00:03:19.810> felt<00:03:20.200> it<00:03:20.590> didn't<00:03:20.889> end<00:03:21.069> well<00:03:21.190> for<00:03:21.400> us<00:03:21.790> in

00:03:22.080 --> 00:03:22.090 
now it felt it didn't end well for us in

00:03:22.090 --> 00:03:25.680 
now it felt it didn't end well for us in
the<00:03:22.329> 90s<00:03:23.370> we<00:03:24.370> never<00:03:24.609> felt<00:03:24.910> like<00:03:25.090> the<00:03:25.269> album<00:03:25.510> got

00:03:25.680 --> 00:03:25.690 
the 90s we never felt like the album got

00:03:25.690 --> 00:03:27.270 
the 90s we never felt like the album got
the<00:03:25.930> recognition<00:03:26.109> it

00:03:27.270 --> 00:03:27.280 
the recognition it

00:03:27.280 --> 00:03:30.539 
the recognition it
we<00:03:27.700> had<00:03:27.880> drug<00:03:28.180> problems<00:03:28.590> the<00:03:29.590> label<00:03:30.040> was<00:03:30.250> like

00:03:30.539 --> 00:03:30.549 
we had drug problems the label was like

00:03:30.549 --> 00:03:34.740 
we had drug problems the label was like
sort<00:03:31.510> of<00:03:31.599> ambivalent<00:03:32.910> now<00:03:33.910> coming<00:03:34.269> back<00:03:34.389> now

00:03:34.740 --> 00:03:34.750 
sort of ambivalent now coming back now

00:03:34.750 --> 00:03:38.129 
sort of ambivalent now coming back now
where<00:03:35.530> it's<00:03:35.889> just<00:03:36.190> more<00:03:36.579> about<00:03:36.760> the<00:03:37.569> music<00:03:37.840> now

00:03:38.129 --> 00:03:38.139 
where it's just more about the music now

00:03:38.139 --> 00:03:40.650 
where it's just more about the music now
and<00:03:38.440> there's<00:03:39.010> nothing<00:03:39.400> really<00:03:39.669> getting<00:03:40.540> in

00:03:40.650 --> 00:03:40.660 
and there's nothing really getting in

00:03:40.660 --> 00:03:43.260 
and there's nothing really getting in
the<00:03:40.750> way<00:03:40.780> at<00:03:41.230> least<00:03:41.440> so<00:03:41.590> far

00:03:43.260 --> 00:03:43.270 
the way at least so far

00:03:43.270 --> 00:03:48.600 
the way at least so far
yeah<00:03:43.900> I<00:03:44.200> think<00:03:44.260> that<00:03:44.860> it<00:03:45.490> was<00:03:46.800> the<00:03:47.800> the<00:03:48.250> drugs

00:03:48.600 --> 00:03:48.610 
yeah I think that it was the the drugs

00:03:48.610 --> 00:03:52.020 
yeah I think that it was the the drugs
and<00:03:48.910> be<00:03:49.590> the<00:03:50.590> state<00:03:50.920> that<00:03:51.100> I<00:03:51.130> was<00:03:51.250> in<00:03:51.430> where<00:03:52.000> I

00:03:52.020 --> 00:03:52.030 
and be the state that I was in where I

00:03:52.030 --> 00:03:54.900 
and be the state that I was in where I
was<00:03:52.510> sort<00:03:52.750> of<00:03:52.810> in<00:03:52.990> over<00:03:53.320> my<00:03:53.350> head<00:03:53.500> with<00:03:53.950> with

00:03:54.900 --> 00:03:54.910 
was sort of in over my head with with

00:03:54.910 --> 00:03:57.750 
was sort of in over my head with with
the<00:03:55.060> drugs<00:03:55.300> I<00:03:55.570> was<00:03:55.750> not<00:03:55.930> in<00:03:56.080> control<00:03:56.380> that<00:03:57.280> that

00:03:57.750 --> 00:03:57.760 
the drugs I was not in control that that

00:03:57.760 --> 00:04:02.310 
the drugs I was not in control that that
became<00:03:58.770> metaphorical<00:03:59.770> to<00:04:00.670> the<00:04:01.630> theme<00:04:02.020> of<00:04:02.050> the

00:04:02.310 --> 00:04:02.320 
became metaphorical to the theme of the

00:04:02.320 --> 00:04:04.620 
became metaphorical to the theme of the
record<00:04:02.710> it's<00:04:03.220> kind<00:04:03.520> of<00:04:03.580> like<00:04:03.820> that<00:04:04.270> was<00:04:04.420> the

00:04:04.620 --> 00:04:04.630 
record it's kind of like that was the

00:04:04.630 --> 00:04:09.870 
record it's kind of like that was the
muse<00:04:04.930> or<00:04:05.230> the<00:04:07.680> you<00:04:08.680> know<00:04:08.800> what<00:04:09.040> what<00:04:09.340> it<00:04:09.700> was

00:04:09.870 --> 00:04:09.880 
muse or the you know what what it was

00:04:09.880 --> 00:04:12.570 
muse or the you know what what it was
what<00:04:10.480> was<00:04:10.600> drive<00:04:10.960> it<00:04:11.170> and<00:04:11.430> underpinnings<00:04:12.430> of

00:04:12.570 --> 00:04:12.580 
what was drive it and underpinnings of

00:04:12.580 --> 00:04:15.090 
what was drive it and underpinnings of
all<00:04:12.820> all<00:04:13.450> the<00:04:13.720> songs<00:04:13.960> emotionally<00:04:14.710> it<00:04:15.070> was

00:04:15.090 --> 00:04:15.100 
all all the songs emotionally it was

00:04:15.100 --> 00:04:17.000 
all all the songs emotionally it was
instead<00:04:15.460> of<00:04:15.580> it<00:04:15.730> being<00:04:15.760> a<00:04:16.000> person<00:04:16.420> it<00:04:16.570> was

00:04:17.000 --> 00:04:17.010 
instead of it being a person it was

00:04:17.010 --> 00:04:20.100 
instead of it being a person it was

the<00:04:24.040> thing<00:04:24.100> is<00:04:24.400> that<00:04:24.610> we<00:04:25.410> we<00:04:26.410> have<00:04:26.530> a<00:04:26.590> lot<00:04:26.800> to

00:04:26.820 --> 00:04:26.830 
the thing is that we we have a lot to

00:04:26.830 --> 00:04:30.680 
the thing is that we we have a lot to
live<00:04:27.520> up<00:04:27.580> to<00:04:28.140> for<00:04:29.140> ourselves<00:04:29.230> and<00:04:29.830> I<00:04:30.040> think

00:04:30.680 --> 00:04:30.690 
live up to for ourselves and I think

we're<00:04:31.690> basically<00:04:32.470> if<00:04:32.740> we<00:04:32.980> ended<00:04:33.400> up<00:04:33.520> with<00:04:33.760> a

00:04:33.960 --> 00:04:33.970 
we're basically if we ended up with a

00:04:33.970 --> 00:04:37.440 
we're basically if we ended up with a
record<00:04:34.390> that<00:04:34.720> it<00:04:35.260> just<00:04:35.530> wasn't<00:04:36.150> it<00:04:37.150> didn't

play live so we have an opportunity to
just<00:05:09.110> kind<00:05:09.380> of<00:05:09.710> pick<00:05:09.860> up<00:05:09.980> where<00:05:10.040> we<00:05:10.310> left<00:05:10.460> off

00:05:11.080 --> 00:05:11.090 
just kind of pick up where we left off

00:05:11.090 --> 00:05:14.110 
just kind of pick up where we left off
it<00:05:11.750> was<00:05:11.930> weird<00:05:12.170> they<00:05:12.380> in<00:05:13.190> the<00:05:13.310> very<00:05:13.670> beginning

00:05:14.110 --> 00:05:14.120 
it was weird they in the very beginning

00:05:14.120 --> 00:05:17.170 
it was weird they in the very beginning
when<00:05:14.330> we<00:05:14.360> toured<00:05:14.990> with<00:05:15.080> them<00:05:15.550> their<00:05:16.550> their<00:05:16.940> fan

00:05:17.170 --> 00:05:17.180 
when we toured with them their their fan

00:05:17.180 --> 00:05:21.010 
when we toured with them their their fan
base<00:05:17.450> was<00:05:17.720> very<00:05:18.050> kind<00:05:19.040> of<00:05:19.130> like<00:05:19.400> more<00:05:20.210> open<00:05:20.840> to

00:05:21.010 --> 00:05:21.020 
base was very kind of like more open to

00:05:21.020 --> 00:05:23.770 
base was very kind of like more open to
different<00:05:22.000> kinds<00:05:23.000> of<00:05:23.090> stuff<00:05:23.330> and<00:05:23.540> then<00:05:23.660> as

00:05:23.770 --> 00:05:23.780 
different kinds of stuff and then as

00:05:23.780 --> 00:05:25.960 
different kinds of stuff and then as
time<00:05:24.050> went<00:05:24.260> on<00:05:24.380> I<00:05:24.440> think<00:05:24.860> their<00:05:25.040> fanbase<00:05:25.430> kind

00:05:25.960 --> 00:05:25.970 
time went on I think their fanbase kind

00:05:25.970 --> 00:05:28.600 
time went on I think their fanbase kind
of<00:05:26.090> distilled<00:05:26.570> into<00:05:26.960> a<00:05:26.990> little<00:05:27.350> more<00:05:28.160> metal

00:05:28.600 --> 00:05:28.610 
of distilled into a little more metal

00:05:28.610 --> 00:05:31.480 
of distilled into a little more metal
leaning<00:05:29.450> people<00:05:29.840> yeah<00:05:30.560> so<00:05:30.800> some<00:05:31.010> of<00:05:31.040> the<00:05:31.220> later

00:06:16.990 --> 00:06:17.000 
of the big chord changes of songs and

00:06:17.000 --> 00:06:19.330 
of the big chord changes of songs and
then<00:06:17.240> when<00:06:17.930> you<00:06:18.020> come<00:06:18.500> into<00:06:18.650> a<00:06:18.770> bridge<00:06:19.070> where

00:06:19.330 --> 00:06:19.340 
then when you come into a bridge where

00:06:19.340 --> 00:06:22.300 
then when you come into a bridge where
there<00:06:19.460> was<00:06:19.580> kind<00:06:19.850> of<00:06:19.970> like<00:06:20.150> a<00:06:20.890> fairly<00:06:21.890> complex

00:06:22.300 --> 00:06:22.310 
there was kind of like a fairly complex

00:06:22.310 --> 00:06:24.640 
there was kind of like a fairly complex
picking<00:06:23.000> pattern<00:06:23.450> or<00:06:23.690> you<00:06:24.170> know<00:06:24.290> the<00:06:24.440> notes

00:06:24.640 --> 00:06:24.650 
picking pattern or you know the notes

00:06:24.650 --> 00:06:28.750 
picking pattern or you know the notes
were<00:06:24.890> all<00:06:25.040> over<00:06:25.370> and<00:06:26.440> your<00:06:27.440> fingers<00:06:28.130> were<00:06:28.370> just

00:06:28.750 --> 00:06:28.760 
were all over and your fingers were just

00:06:28.760 --> 00:06:31.150 
were all over and your fingers were just
doing<00:06:29.210> it<00:06:29.330> you<00:06:29.840> know<00:06:29.960> despite<00:06:30.350> your<00:06:30.650> head<00:06:30.890> you

00:06:31.150 --> 00:06:31.160 
doing it you know despite your head you

00:06:31.160 --> 00:06:32.270 
doing it you know despite your head you
have<00:06:31.310> kind<00:06:31.640> of

00:06:32.270 --> 00:06:32.280 
have kind of

00:06:32.280 --> 00:06:35.640 
have kind of
so<00:06:33.280> it<00:06:33.400> was<00:06:33.580> it<00:06:34.300> was<00:06:34.360> strange<00:06:34.810> I<00:06:35.140> think<00:06:35.440> we<00:06:35.530> knew

00:06:35.640 --> 00:06:35.650 
so it was it was strange I think we knew

00:06:35.650 --> 00:06:37.830 
so it was it was strange I think we knew
pretty<00:06:35.800> early<00:06:35.950> on<00:06:36.310> that<00:06:36.520> it<00:06:36.640> was<00:06:36.760> good<00:06:37.120> we

00:06:37.830 --> 00:06:37.840 
pretty early on that it was good we

00:06:37.840 --> 00:06:42.660 
pretty early on that it was good we
still<00:06:38.050> kind<00:06:38.320> of<00:06:38.470> had<00:06:39.190> the<00:06:40.260> the<00:06:41.260> thing<00:06:41.560> yeah<00:06:42.400> and

00:06:42.660 --> 00:06:42.670 
still kind of had the the thing yeah and

00:06:42.670 --> 00:06:43.740 
still kind of had the the thing yeah and
then<00:06:42.820> when<00:06:42.970> we<00:06:43.090> get<00:06:43.240> when<00:06:43.360> we<00:06:43.450> played<00:06:43.630> with

00:06:43.740 --> 00:06:43.750 
then when we get when we played with

00:06:43.750 --> 00:06:44.430 
then when we get when we played with
Kelly

00:06:44.430 --> 00:06:44.440 
Kelly

00:06:44.440 --> 00:06:49.110 
Kelly
it<00:06:44.530> was<00:06:45.600> I<00:06:47.040> don't<00:06:48.040> know<00:06:48.130> in<00:06:48.280> ways<00:06:48.460> I<00:06:48.730> felt<00:06:49.000> like

00:06:49.110 --> 00:06:49.120 
it was I don't know in ways I felt like

00:06:49.120 --> 00:06:51.090 
it was I don't know in ways I felt like
it<00:06:49.270> was<00:06:49.390> stronger<00:06:49.900> than<00:06:50.050> it<00:06:50.170> ever<00:06:50.410> was

00:06:51.090 --> 00:06:51.100 
it was stronger than it ever was

00:06:51.100 --> 00:06:54.390 
it was stronger than it ever was
yeah<00:06:51.930> so<00:06:52.930> that<00:06:53.110> I<00:06:53.410> mean<00:06:53.560> of<00:06:53.620> course<00:06:53.680> just<00:06:54.280> a

00:06:54.390 --> 00:06:54.400 
yeah so that I mean of course just a

00:06:54.400 --> 00:06:55.980 
yeah so that I mean of course just a
little<00:06:54.430> hard<00:06:54.730> for<00:06:54.790> us<00:06:54.910> to<00:06:55.090> tell<00:06:55.270> a<00:06:55.510> little

00:06:55.980 --> 00:06:55.990 
little hard for us to tell a little

00:06:55.990 --> 00:06:58.350 
little hard for us to tell a little
slightly<00:06:56.260> close<00:06:56.590> to<00:06:56.770> it<00:06:56.890> but<00:06:57.310> I<00:06:57.550> feel<00:06:58.240> like

00:06:58.350 --> 00:06:58.360 
slightly close to it but I feel like

00:06:58.360 --> 00:06:59.820 
slightly close to it but I feel like
we're<00:06:58.540> playing<00:06:58.780> some<00:06:58.990> of<00:06:59.020> the<00:06:59.200> start<00:06:59.440> better

00:06:59.820 --> 00:06:59.830 
we're playing some of the start better

00:06:59.830 --> 00:07:02.910 
we're playing some of the start better
than<00:07:00.040> we<00:07:00.160> did<00:07:00.280> in<00:07:00.340> the<00:07:00.520> 90s
