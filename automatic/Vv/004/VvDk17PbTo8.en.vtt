00:00:04.509 --> 00:00:06.690 

a<00:00:04.709> couple<00:00:05.709> of<00:00:05.769> questions<00:00:06.129> we<00:00:06.189> get<00:00:06.370> asked<00:00:06.639> here

00:00:06.690 --> 00:00:06.700 
a couple of questions we get asked here

00:00:06.700 --> 00:00:09.709 
a couple of questions we get asked here
at<00:00:06.819> Delphi<00:00:07.149> Ilan<00:00:07.419> is<00:00:07.769> do<00:00:08.769> I<00:00:08.830> have<00:00:09.070> to<00:00:09.190> anneal<00:00:09.400> my

00:00:09.709 --> 00:00:09.719 
at Delphi Ilan is do I have to anneal my

00:00:09.719 --> 00:00:12.449 
at Delphi Ilan is do I have to anneal my
pieces<00:00:10.719> and<00:00:10.959> how<00:00:11.289> do<00:00:11.349> I<00:00:11.469> do<00:00:11.559> it<00:00:11.709> well<00:00:12.309> you<00:00:12.369> know

00:00:12.449 --> 00:00:12.459 
pieces and how do I do it well you know

00:00:12.459 --> 00:00:13.920 
pieces and how do I do it well you know
I<00:00:12.580> mean<00:00:12.760> you<00:00:12.850> don't<00:00:12.939> have<00:00:13.180> to<00:00:13.359> know<00:00:13.539> your<00:00:13.719> piece

00:00:13.920 --> 00:00:13.930 
I mean you don't have to know your piece

00:00:13.930 --> 00:00:15.869 
I mean you don't have to know your piece
but<00:00:14.170> you'll<00:00:14.410> but<00:00:14.949> you<00:00:15.039> really<00:00:15.279> need<00:00:15.490> to<00:00:15.670> be<00:00:15.760> on

00:00:15.869 --> 00:00:15.879 
but you'll but you really need to be on

00:00:15.879 --> 00:00:19.410 
but you'll but you really need to be on
your<00:00:16.059> pieces<00:00:16.439> annealing<00:00:17.439> is<00:00:17.740> just<00:00:18.130> where<00:00:18.789> when

00:00:19.410 --> 00:00:19.420 
your pieces annealing is just where when

00:00:19.420 --> 00:00:21.210 
your pieces annealing is just where when
you're<00:00:19.570> cooling<00:00:19.869> your<00:00:20.140> piece<00:00:20.410> down<00:00:20.770> after

00:00:21.210 --> 00:00:21.220 
you're cooling your piece down after

00:00:21.220 --> 00:00:24.000 
you're cooling your piece down after
fusing<00:00:21.730> it<00:00:21.880> or<00:00:22.090> flameworking<00:00:22.990> it<00:00:23.350> you<00:00:23.770> need<00:00:23.920> to

00:00:24.000 --> 00:00:24.010 
fusing it or flameworking it you need to

00:00:24.010 --> 00:00:25.710 
fusing it or flameworking it you need to
cool<00:00:24.220> your<00:00:24.400> piece<00:00:24.610> down<00:00:24.850> so<00:00:25.240> that<00:00:25.420> all<00:00:25.570> the

00:00:25.710 --> 00:00:25.720 
cool your piece down so that all the

00:00:25.720 --> 00:00:28.080 
cool your piece down so that all the
stress<00:00:26.050> is<00:00:26.230> relieved<00:00:26.680> from<00:00:27.039> the<00:00:27.190> glass<00:00:27.400> you

00:00:28.080 --> 00:00:28.090 
stress is relieved from the glass you

00:00:28.090 --> 00:00:30.090 
stress is relieved from the glass you
can<00:00:28.240> see<00:00:28.480> like<00:00:28.779> on<00:00:29.199> a<00:00:29.260> plate<00:00:29.529> like<00:00:29.560> this<00:00:29.740> where

00:00:30.090 --> 00:00:30.100 
can see like on a plate like this where

00:00:30.100 --> 00:00:31.769 
can see like on a plate like this where
it's<00:00:30.220> consists<00:00:30.640> of<00:00:30.730> about<00:00:30.970> six<00:00:31.330> or<00:00:31.510> seven

00:00:31.769 --> 00:00:31.779 
it's consists of about six or seven

00:00:31.779 --> 00:00:33.599 
it's consists of about six or seven
different<00:00:32.020> types<00:00:32.590> of<00:00:32.829> glass<00:00:33.039> or<00:00:33.280> colors<00:00:33.579> of

00:00:33.599 --> 00:00:33.609 
different types of glass or colors of

00:00:33.609 --> 00:00:35.910 
different types of glass or colors of
glass<00:00:33.940> we<00:00:34.600> have<00:00:34.719> to<00:00:34.840> just<00:00:35.170> make<00:00:35.350> sure<00:00:35.559> that<00:00:35.770> as

00:00:35.910 --> 00:00:35.920 
glass we have to just make sure that as

00:00:35.920 --> 00:00:37.889 
glass we have to just make sure that as
we're<00:00:36.070> cooling<00:00:36.399> this<00:00:36.670> down<00:00:36.940> that<00:00:37.210> all<00:00:37.539> the

00:00:37.889 --> 00:00:37.899 
we're cooling this down that all the

00:00:37.899 --> 00:00:40.319 
we're cooling this down that all the
colors<00:00:38.229> are<00:00:38.469> cooling<00:00:39.129> at<00:00:39.370> the<00:00:39.489> same<00:00:39.699> time<00:00:39.969> and

00:00:40.319 --> 00:00:40.329 
colors are cooling at the same time and

00:00:40.329 --> 00:00:42.000 
colors are cooling at the same time and
all<00:00:40.690> the<00:00:40.839> glass<00:00:41.050> is<00:00:41.319> reaching<00:00:41.739> the<00:00:41.829> same

00:00:42.000 --> 00:00:42.010 
all the glass is reaching the same

00:00:42.010 --> 00:00:43.739 
all the glass is reaching the same
temperature<00:00:42.460> so<00:00:42.760> we<00:00:42.850> do<00:00:42.999> that<00:00:43.179> by<00:00:43.359> annealing

00:00:43.739 --> 00:00:43.749 
temperature so we do that by annealing

00:00:43.749 --> 00:00:45.629 
temperature so we do that by annealing
and<00:00:44.109> holding<00:00:44.769> it<00:00:44.859> at<00:00:44.949> a<00:00:44.979> specific<00:00:45.219> temperature

00:00:45.629 --> 00:00:45.639 
and holding it at a specific temperature

00:00:45.639 --> 00:00:48.360 
and holding it at a specific temperature
in<00:00:46.149> flame<00:00:46.870> working<00:00:47.350> after<00:00:48.010> you've<00:00:48.159> done<00:00:48.309> your

00:00:48.360 --> 00:00:48.370 
in flame working after you've done your

00:00:48.370 --> 00:00:50.489 
in flame working after you've done your
bead<00:00:48.760> you'll<00:00:49.569> want<00:00:49.780> to<00:00:49.839> put<00:00:50.049> that<00:00:50.229> in<00:00:50.409> an

00:00:50.489 --> 00:00:50.499 
bead you'll want to put that in an

00:00:50.499 --> 00:00:51.959 
bead you'll want to put that in an
annealer<00:00:50.889> for<00:00:51.129> the<00:00:51.190> same<00:00:51.429> reason<00:00:51.819> because

00:00:51.959 --> 00:00:51.969 
annealer for the same reason because

00:00:51.969 --> 00:00:54.329 
annealer for the same reason because
it's<00:00:52.929> possible<00:00:53.469> in<00:00:53.559> these<00:00:53.710> at<00:00:53.889> the<00:00:54.010> core<00:00:54.309> of

00:00:54.329 --> 00:00:54.339 
it's possible in these at the core of

00:00:54.339 --> 00:00:55.979 
it's possible in these at the core of
this<00:00:54.670> glass<00:00:54.940> is<00:00:55.269> hotter<00:00:55.539> than<00:00:55.719> the<00:00:55.899> outside

00:00:55.979 --> 00:00:55.989 
this glass is hotter than the outside

00:00:55.989 --> 00:00:58.110 
this glass is hotter than the outside
surface<00:00:56.859> and<00:00:57.129> so<00:00:57.579> you<00:00:57.639> don't<00:00:57.850> want<00:00:57.999> them

00:00:58.110 --> 00:00:58.120 
surface and so you don't want them

00:00:58.120 --> 00:01:00.419 
surface and so you don't want them
cooling<00:00:58.629> irregularly<00:00:59.260> or<00:00:59.289> what<00:00:59.829> will<00:01:00.069> happen

00:01:00.419 --> 00:01:00.429 
cooling irregularly or what will happen

00:01:00.429 --> 00:01:02.959 
cooling irregularly or what will happen
is<00:01:00.579> because<00:01:01.359> of<00:01:01.479> the<00:01:01.569> stress<00:01:01.870> they'll<00:01:02.109> break

00:01:02.959 --> 00:01:02.969 
is because of the stress they'll break

00:01:02.969 --> 00:01:06.930 
is because of the stress they'll break
in<00:01:03.969> a<00:01:04.199> piece<00:01:05.199> like<00:01:05.440> this<00:01:05.610> this<00:01:06.610> room<00:01:06.820> nice

00:01:06.930 --> 00:01:06.940 
in a piece like this this room nice

00:01:06.940 --> 00:01:09.450 
in a piece like this this room nice
sculptural<00:01:07.510> fish<00:01:07.780> piece<00:01:08.080> the<00:01:08.890> fins<00:01:09.190> are<00:01:09.370> gonna

00:01:09.450 --> 00:01:09.460 
sculptural fish piece the fins are gonna

00:01:09.460 --> 00:01:11.610 
sculptural fish piece the fins are gonna
cool<00:01:09.790> off<00:01:10.000> much<00:01:10.300> faster<00:01:10.870> than<00:01:11.020> the<00:01:11.140> body<00:01:11.350> of

00:01:11.610 --> 00:01:11.620 
cool off much faster than the body of

00:01:11.620 --> 00:01:14.490 
cool off much faster than the body of
the<00:01:11.740> fish<00:01:11.980> just<00:01:12.310> because<00:01:12.610> of<00:01:12.730> mass<00:01:13.030> and<00:01:13.480> so<00:01:14.050> you

00:01:14.490 --> 00:01:14.500 
the fish just because of mass and so you

00:01:14.500 --> 00:01:15.810 
the fish just because of mass and so you
know<00:01:14.590> spending<00:01:15.160> all<00:01:15.280> this<00:01:15.370> time<00:01:15.430> making

00:01:15.810 --> 00:01:15.820 
know spending all this time making

00:01:15.820 --> 00:01:16.770 
know spending all this time making
something<00:01:16.090> like<00:01:16.270> this<00:01:16.390> you<00:01:16.540> would<00:01:16.630> hate<00:01:16.750> to

00:01:16.770 --> 00:01:16.780 
something like this you would hate to

00:01:16.780 --> 00:01:18.930 
something like this you would hate to
see<00:01:17.080> a<00:01:17.110> crack<00:01:17.470> just<00:01:17.950> because<00:01:18.340> it<00:01:18.490> cooled<00:01:18.760> too

00:01:18.930 --> 00:01:18.940 
see a crack just because it cooled too

00:01:18.940 --> 00:01:21.450 
see a crack just because it cooled too
quickly<00:01:19.300> and<00:01:19.480> wasn't<00:01:20.020> annealed<00:01:20.380> properly<00:01:20.950> so

00:01:21.450 --> 00:01:21.460 
quickly and wasn't annealed properly so

00:01:21.460 --> 00:01:23.520 
quickly and wasn't annealed properly so
what<00:01:21.640> we<00:01:21.760> would<00:01:21.880> do<00:01:22.030> is<00:01:22.180> put<00:01:22.390> them<00:01:22.540> in<00:01:22.720> a<00:01:22.990> kiln

00:01:23.520 --> 00:01:23.530 
what we would do is put them in a kiln

00:01:23.530 --> 00:01:26.010 
what we would do is put them in a kiln
this<00:01:24.310> one<00:01:24.520> is<00:01:24.640> obviously<00:01:24.940> a<00:01:25.060> specific<00:01:25.870> one

00:01:26.010 --> 00:01:26.020 
this one is obviously a specific one

00:01:26.020 --> 00:01:28.560 
this one is obviously a specific one
just<00:01:26.350> for<00:01:26.530> flameworking<00:01:27.100> bead<00:01:28.000> annealer<00:01:28.390> and

00:01:28.560 --> 00:01:28.570 
just for flameworking bead annealer and

00:01:28.570 --> 00:01:30.750 
just for flameworking bead annealer and
we<00:01:29.020> would<00:01:29.140> put<00:01:29.320> that<00:01:29.470> in<00:01:29.620> there<00:01:29.800> and<00:01:30.190> hold<00:01:30.550> the

00:01:30.750 --> 00:01:30.760 
we would put that in there and hold the

00:01:30.760 --> 00:01:33.450 
we would put that in there and hold the
glass<00:01:30.970> at<00:01:31.240> a<00:01:31.270> specific<00:01:31.630> temperature<00:01:32.460> until

00:01:33.450 --> 00:01:33.460 
glass at a specific temperature until

00:01:33.460 --> 00:01:35.010 
glass at a specific temperature until
all<00:01:33.760> the<00:01:33.880> glass<00:01:34.090> kind<00:01:34.360> of<00:01:34.450> evens<00:01:34.870> out

00:01:35.010 --> 00:01:35.020 
all the glass kind of evens out

00:01:35.020 --> 00:01:36.990 
all the glass kind of evens out
temperature<00:01:35.620> wise<00:01:35.800> I<00:01:36.130> have<00:01:36.460> a<00:01:36.520> piece<00:01:36.760> here<00:01:36.940> on

00:01:36.990 --> 00:01:37.000 
temperature wise I have a piece here on

00:01:37.000 --> 00:01:40.950 
temperature wise I have a piece here on
the<00:01:37.150> table<00:01:37.600> that<00:01:37.780> was<00:01:38.350> a<00:01:39.750> piece<00:01:40.750> that<00:01:40.780> just

00:01:40.950 --> 00:01:40.960 
the table that was a piece that just

00:01:40.960 --> 00:01:42.750 
the table that was a piece that just
wasn't<00:01:41.410> properly<00:01:41.770> annealed<00:01:42.220> and<00:01:42.370> because<00:01:42.730> of

00:01:42.750 --> 00:01:42.760 
wasn't properly annealed and because of

00:01:42.760 --> 00:01:45.480 
wasn't properly annealed and because of
that<00:01:42.880> fact<00:01:43.210> it<00:01:43.600> cracked<00:01:44.050> afterwards<00:01:44.770> so<00:01:45.100> the

00:01:45.480 --> 00:01:45.490 
that fact it cracked afterwards so the

00:01:45.490 --> 00:01:47.640 
that fact it cracked afterwards so the
danger<00:01:45.730> of<00:01:46.030> annealing<00:01:46.450> is<00:01:46.600> that<00:01:46.810> if<00:01:47.170> you<00:01:47.350> don't

00:01:47.640 --> 00:01:47.650 
danger of annealing is that if you don't

00:01:47.650 --> 00:01:49.320 
danger of annealing is that if you don't
do<00:01:47.890> it<00:01:48.040> or<00:01:48.340> if<00:01:48.580> you<00:01:48.640> don't<00:01:48.790> do<00:01:48.940> it<00:01:49.060> well<00:01:49.300> enough

00:01:49.320 --> 00:01:49.330 
do it or if you don't do it well enough

00:01:49.330 --> 00:01:51.570 
do it or if you don't do it well enough
I<00:01:49.780> mean<00:01:50.050> you<00:01:50.260> might<00:01:50.440> not<00:01:50.590> know<00:01:50.800> until<00:01:51.070> later<00:01:51.310> on

00:01:51.570 --> 00:01:51.580 
I mean you might not know until later on

00:01:51.580 --> 00:01:53.970 
I mean you might not know until later on
when<00:01:51.850> the<00:01:51.970> pieces<00:01:52.420> you<00:01:53.200> know<00:01:53.290> cracked<00:01:53.590> on<00:01:53.800> you

00:01:53.970 --> 00:01:53.980 
when the pieces you know cracked on you

00:01:53.980 --> 00:01:55.800 
when the pieces you know cracked on you
now<00:01:54.370> this<00:01:54.580> could<00:01:54.760> easily<00:01:54.880> be<00:01:55.150> repaired<00:01:55.570> we

00:01:55.800 --> 00:01:55.810 
now this could easily be repaired we

00:01:55.810 --> 00:01:57.570 
now this could easily be repaired we
could<00:01:55.930> put<00:01:56.350> it<00:01:56.440> back<00:01:56.590> in<00:01:56.800> the<00:01:56.890> kiln<00:01:57.130> we<00:01:57.430> could

00:01:57.570 --> 00:01:57.580 
could put it back in the kiln we could

00:01:57.580 --> 00:01:59.430 
could put it back in the kiln we could
refire<00:01:58.150> it<00:01:58.180> and<00:01:58.630> then<00:01:58.930> of<00:01:59.050> course<00:01:59.080> we'd<00:01:59.350> have

00:01:59.430 --> 00:01:59.440 
refire it and then of course we'd have

00:01:59.440 --> 00:02:02.280 
refire it and then of course we'd have
to<00:01:59.560> really<00:02:00.250> lit<00:02:00.490> and<00:02:00.760> for<00:02:01.360> the<00:02:01.450> foremost<00:02:02.170> of

00:02:02.280 --> 00:02:02.290 
to really lit and for the foremost of

to really lit and for the foremost of
the<00:02:02.350> glass<00:02:02.500> that<00:02:02.530> we're<00:02:02.770> dealing<00:02:03.130> with

00:02:03.270 --> 00:02:03.280 
the glass that we're dealing with

00:02:03.280 --> 00:02:06.149 
the glass that we're dealing with
whether<00:02:03.970> it's<00:02:04.120> 104<00:02:04.630> or<00:02:04.900> 90<00:02:05.229> or<00:02:05.260> 96<00:02:05.860> we<00:02:06.040> do

00:02:06.149 --> 00:02:06.159 
whether it's 104 or 90 or 96 we do

00:02:06.159 --> 00:02:08.999 
whether it's 104 or 90 or 96 we do
annealing<00:02:06.670> around<00:02:06.970> 950<00:02:07.930> degrees<00:02:08.259> but<00:02:08.830> you'd

00:02:08.999 --> 00:02:09.009 
annealing around 950 degrees but you'd

00:02:09.009 --> 00:02:10.229 
annealing around 950 degrees but you'd
really<00:02:09.369> want<00:02:09.519> to<00:02:09.640> check<00:02:09.909> with<00:02:10.119> your

really want to check with your

00:02:10.239 --> 00:02:12.000 
really want to check with your
manufacturer<00:02:10.959> to<00:02:11.230> make<00:02:11.560> sure<00:02:11.709> you<00:02:11.800> get<00:02:11.920> the

manufacturer to make sure you get the
