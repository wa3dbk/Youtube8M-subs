00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:06.390
 and 160 and used to 165 that we are in 

00:00:03.360 --> 00:00:08.309
 a micro video in a review of this 

00:00:06.390 --> 00:00:09.720
 serve that they see fire that is being 

00:00:08.309 --> 00:00:11.490
 sorry 

00:00:09.720 --> 00:00:15.059
 better server than I play until now and 

00:00:11.490 --> 00:00:18.290
 Well, I liked it a lot and I thought 

00:00:15.059 --> 00:00:18.290
 why not do this review 

00:00:19.980 --> 00:00:26.199
 Well more than anything later because I already have 

00:00:23.019 --> 00:00:28.480
 thousand subscribers and I wanted to teach 

00:00:26.199 --> 00:00:30.130
 what server do I use now 

00:00:28.480 --> 00:00:31.689
 all this has been done what I have achieved 

00:00:30.130 --> 00:00:35.430
 in Youtube 

00:00:31.689 --> 00:00:37.200
 practically in this and then people 

00:00:35.430 --> 00:00:38.070
 Today I am going to teach you to remember that 

00:00:37.200 --> 00:00:40.200
 the team is going to be here in the 

00:00:38.070 --> 00:00:42.120
 description then teach the things that 

00:00:40.200 --> 00:00:46.080
 have the modalities the content that 

00:00:42.120 --> 00:00:48.720
 can you give us this server as first 

00:00:46.080 --> 00:00:50.520
 has the survival of all the whole 

00:00:48.720 --> 00:00:53.010
 time or be alive the survival as you 

00:00:50.520 --> 00:00:55.890
 tell us what we want, and then you have 

00:00:53.010 --> 00:00:59.309
 here to be online but the truth is that 

00:00:55.890 --> 00:01:01.110
 the artist herself with a box 

00:00:59.309 --> 00:01:04.320
 would mark in red with a box in red 

00:01:01.110 --> 00:01:09.040
 those are the real ones then have a 

00:01:04.320 --> 00:01:12.070
 faction faction action 

00:01:09.040 --> 00:01:13.870
 Well, that's what the sky block has. Sorry 

00:01:12.070 --> 00:01:17.020
 If I'm not going to comment very well these 

00:01:13.870 --> 00:01:19.180
 laver videos that I'm sick and the 

00:01:17.020 --> 00:01:22.300
 I really do not know what they do not know 

00:01:19.180 --> 00:01:24.160
 amount but I'm sick and then the 

00:01:22.300 --> 00:01:26.380
 next skyworks that is the best 

00:01:24.160 --> 00:01:29.500
 which has practically the best 

00:01:26.380 --> 00:01:32.350
 you have is now block and vp have it 

00:01:29.500 --> 00:01:34.240
 the hunger games' that the one is that I believe 

00:01:32.350 --> 00:01:37.330
 that I've never seen again in this in 

00:01:34.240 --> 00:01:39.850
 a server and they are fantastic had close 

00:01:37.330 --> 00:01:42.790
 of two years that did not play a year and the 

00:01:39.850 --> 00:01:45.729
 I found this product has towers 

00:01:42.790 --> 00:01:48.700
 what I do not know is that it treats very well this 

00:01:45.729 --> 00:01:50.040
 it was buster's island that in the 

00:01:48.700 --> 00:01:52.490
 description 

00:01:50.040 --> 00:01:54.320
 friend with 

00:01:52.490 --> 00:01:57.200
 then it was because many people by 

00:01:54.320 --> 00:01:59.940
 know that a new dose of 

00:01:57.200 --> 00:02:01.659
 people people 

00:01:59.940 --> 00:02:04.710
 for 

00:02:01.659 --> 00:02:04.710
 to teach him 

00:02:04.760 --> 00:02:10.490
 and the cats have not 

00:02:08.250 --> 00:02:12.570
 instead it is the south of the usual 

00:02:10.490 --> 00:02:14.760
 faction the truth that I do not understand it yet 

00:02:12.570 --> 00:02:17.670
 facing new faction is that there 

00:02:14.760 --> 00:02:18.090
 blocks the blog of all life the sky 

00:02:17.670 --> 00:02:21.300
 war 

00:02:18.090 --> 00:02:23.940
 let's use and well this is the lobby of 

00:02:21.300 --> 00:02:27.420
 sky war has enough on maps that are 

00:02:23.940 --> 00:02:30.420
 all these easy and cardio month all everything 

00:02:27.420 --> 00:02:32.430
 everything all all all this is not not like 

00:02:30.420 --> 00:02:34.200
 the type of server that already has the 

00:02:32.430 --> 00:02:36.570
 predetermined chests and for example that 

00:02:34.200 --> 00:02:39.120
 in this chest will touch leather things 

00:02:36.570 --> 00:02:40.440
 with a stone sword 

00:02:39.120 --> 00:02:43.020
 has been everything as well as more or 

00:02:40.440 --> 00:02:45.830
 less varied good you can see if I can 

00:02:43.020 --> 00:02:45.830
 enter this stop 

00:02:45.950 --> 00:02:51.730
 I'll teach you to the chests 

00:02:52.780 --> 00:02:56.470
 well banesto the chests are the chests 

00:02:54.910 --> 00:02:57.520
 that there are also you can see in the 

00:02:56.470 --> 00:02:59.860
 videos that I'm going to do here in the 

00:02:57.520 --> 00:03:01.540
 description that is if you are not subscribed 

00:02:59.860 --> 00:03:04.209
 this channel subscribe to stay there and 

00:03:01.540 --> 00:03:05.600
 comment I commented the video more than 

00:03:04.209 --> 00:03:08.390
 nothing 

00:03:05.600 --> 00:03:09.980
 and then these are the things that I gave you 

00:03:08.390 --> 00:03:13.100
 the time they are quite varied things 

00:03:09.980 --> 00:03:18.500
 who wants to show you is that the 

00:03:13.100 --> 00:03:22.160
 songs are fantastic different to them 

00:03:18.500 --> 00:03:24.050
 to go to the main lobby is 

00:03:22.160 --> 00:03:26.690
 once I do not know if it 's diagonal or I saw 

00:03:24.050 --> 00:03:28.520
 I also think it works the same 

00:03:26.690 --> 00:03:31.340
 having with much the keys as 

00:03:28.520 --> 00:03:34.820
 support 2 and that is stuck in the core 

00:03:31.340 --> 00:03:36.380
 welcome if your name is an email and 

00:03:34.820 --> 00:03:39.710
 Well, the next thing I wanted to show you 

00:03:36.380 --> 00:03:41.930
 the hunger games' this is that I do not feel 

00:03:39.710 --> 00:03:44.540
 as the type of game that you leave 

00:03:41.930 --> 00:03:46.280
 has a map like that of minecraft and what 

00:03:44.540 --> 00:03:50.120
 they have to start doing tricks and everything 

00:03:46.280 --> 00:03:52.310
 that is not maps, and since it's done 

00:03:50.120 --> 00:03:54.080
 practically you 're not going to leave you as in 

00:03:52.310 --> 00:03:56.390
 the hunger games' was movies and the 

00:03:54.080 --> 00:03:58.710
 debates to watch the hunger games that 

00:03:56.390 --> 00:04:01.860
 they leave them 

00:03:58.710 --> 00:04:06.150
 in a place with 24 people and then you 

00:04:01.860 --> 00:04:08.520
 You're running with rococo clothes rocco 

00:04:06.150 --> 00:04:10.760
 san andrÃ©s and I can go out I do not know if with 

00:04:08.520 --> 00:04:10.760
 that 

00:04:11.290 --> 00:04:15.920
 I think I think most of the 

00:04:14.030 --> 00:04:18.230
 people who also from this video no longer 

00:04:15.920 --> 00:04:20.630
 they came to this part and thanks to this 

00:04:18.230 --> 00:04:24.760
 part, I thank you very much 

00:04:20.630 --> 00:04:24.760
 and then to return is again the same 

00:04:25.380 --> 00:04:30.210
 sorry people 

00:04:27.810 --> 00:04:32.639
 good good people this was all in the 

00:04:30.210 --> 00:04:34.139
 video and then do not forget to subscribe to it 

00:04:32.639 --> 00:04:35.730
 I mentioned sharing I would be grateful 

00:04:34.139 --> 00:04:37.800
 a lot and thanks for the same 

00:04:35.730 --> 00:04:40.440
 writers that we are already and well I think 

00:04:37.800 --> 00:04:42.500
 that in this service if everything goes well 

00:04:40.440 --> 00:04:44.970
 they will be able to subtract the youtube rank 

00:04:42.500 --> 00:04:47.610
 because I do not know if my work is not 

00:04:44.970 --> 00:04:49.770
 I know but it's depends on the things I go up 

00:04:47.610 --> 00:04:53.130
 of the content of how everything is 

00:04:49.770 --> 00:04:56.750
 and it depends I think so although 

00:04:53.130 --> 00:04:59.880
 come out tell me on Tuesday in Mexico today the 

00:04:56.750 --> 00:05:01.770
 Sunday I think if it comes out if not then 

00:04:59.880 --> 00:05:04.440
 another day maybe or maybe it's not my turn 

00:05:01.770 --> 00:05:06.840
 stability that they give me and then no 

00:05:04.440 --> 00:05:08.340
 forget to subscribe the truth comment 

00:05:06.840 --> 00:05:11.540
 to share, thank you, see you 

00:05:08.340 --> 00:05:11.540
 in a next video until next time
