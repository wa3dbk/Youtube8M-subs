00:02:47.360 --> 00:02:47.370 
end of the product list which means that

00:02:47.370 --> 00:02:49.160 
end of the product list which means that
there's<00:02:47.519> barely<00:02:47.819> any<00:02:48.120> in<00:02:48.389> the<00:02:48.540> product<00:02:48.959> and

there's barely any in the product and

00:02:49.170 --> 00:02:50.809 
there's barely any in the product and
then<00:02:49.560> some<00:02:49.769> of<00:02:49.889> them<00:02:49.980> don't<00:02:50.159> listed<00:02:50.549> at<00:02:50.639> all

then some of them don't listed at all
which<00:02:51.180> I<00:02:51.359> think<00:02:51.569> probably<00:02:51.750> means<00:02:52.139> that

00:02:52.280 --> 00:02:52.290 
which I think probably means that

00:02:52.290 --> 00:02:53.899 
which I think probably means that
they're<00:02:52.889> just<00:02:53.099> using<00:02:53.310> an<00:02:53.519> artificial

they're just using an artificial

00:02:53.909 --> 00:02:56.210 
they're just using an artificial
lavender<00:02:54.599> fragrance<00:02:55.200> so<00:02:55.680> it<00:02:55.769> isn't<00:02:56.099> natural

00:02:56.210 --> 00:02:56.220 
lavender fragrance so it isn't natural

00:02:56.220 --> 00:02:58.129 
lavender fragrance so it isn't natural
lavender<00:02:56.909> so<00:02:57.299> just<00:02:57.510> make<00:02:57.659> sure<00:02:57.840> that<00:02:57.870> it

00:02:58.129 --> 00:02:58.139 
lavender so just make sure that it

00:02:58.139 --> 00:03:00.410 
lavender so just make sure that it
actually<00:02:58.379> has<00:02:58.799> lavender<00:02:59.310> in<00:02:59.579> it<00:02:59.790> before<00:03:00.180> you

00:03:48.170 --> 00:03:48.180 
this chapstick size lip balm I don't

00:03:48.180 --> 00:03:49.490 
this chapstick size lip balm I don't
know<00:03:48.239> why<00:03:48.449> they<00:03:48.690> can't<00:03:48.900> just<00:03:49.079> sell<00:03:49.260> it<00:03:49.379> like

00:03:49.490 --> 00:03:49.500 
know why they can't just sell it like

00:03:49.500 --> 00:03:51.740 
know why they can't just sell it like
this<00:03:49.769> maybe<00:03:50.370> it's<00:03:50.609> because<00:03:50.760> it<00:03:51.180> is<00:03:51.359> kind<00:03:51.720> of

00:03:51.740 --> 00:03:51.750 
this maybe it's because it is kind of

00:03:51.750 --> 00:03:53.479 
this maybe it's because it is kind of
expensive<00:03:52.139> her<00:03:52.470> lip<00:03:52.709> balms<00:03:52.919> so<00:03:53.190> they<00:03:53.280> think

00:03:53.479 --> 00:03:53.489 
expensive her lip balms so they think

00:03:53.489 --> 00:03:54.559 
expensive her lip balms so they think
that<00:03:53.579> if<00:03:53.699> they<00:03:53.729> put<00:03:54.000> all<00:03:54.209> this<00:03:54.329> extra

00:03:54.559 --> 00:03:54.569 
that if they put all this extra

00:03:54.569 --> 00:03:56.059 
that if they put all this extra
packaging<00:03:55.169> that<00:03:55.260> you'll<00:03:55.409> feel<00:03:55.620> like<00:03:55.829> you're

00:03:56.059 --> 00:03:56.069 
packaging that you'll feel like you're

00:03:56.069 --> 00:03:58.339 
packaging that you'll feel like you're
getting<00:03:56.879> something<00:03:57.090> a<00:03:57.239> little<00:03:57.419> bit<00:03:57.540> nicer<00:03:57.989> or

00:03:58.339 --> 00:03:58.349 
getting something a little bit nicer or

00:03:58.349 --> 00:04:01.719 
getting something a little bit nicer or
fancier<00:03:59.040> but<00:03:59.879> anyway<00:04:00.299> I<00:04:00.329> do<00:04:00.599> like<00:04:00.930> the<00:04:01.049> product
