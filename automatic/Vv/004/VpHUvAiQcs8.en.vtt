00:00:15.890 --> 00:00:15.900 
for us of course but Sweden is difficult

00:00:15.900 --> 00:00:17.779 
for us of course but Sweden is difficult

00:00:17.779 --> 00:00:17.789 
ready for me i have not very little

00:00:17.789 --> 00:00:20.840 
ready for me i have not very little
experience<00:00:18.060> on<00:00:18.390> snow<00:00:18.630> so<00:00:19.310> last<00:00:20.310> year<00:00:20.430> this

00:00:20.840 --> 00:00:20.850 
experience on snow so last year this

00:00:20.850 --> 00:00:22.580 
experience on snow so last year this
rally<00:00:21.119> has<00:00:21.359> been<00:00:21.510> very<00:00:21.779> very<00:00:21.990> difficult<00:00:22.109> for

00:00:22.580 --> 00:00:22.590 
rally has been very very difficult for

00:00:22.590 --> 00:00:25.550 
rally has been very very difficult for
me<00:00:22.710> and<00:00:22.980> i<00:00:23.250> was<00:00:23.609> very<00:00:23.760> slow<00:00:24.090> so<00:00:24.439> tomorrow<00:00:25.439> i

00:00:25.550 --> 00:00:25.560 
me and i was very slow so tomorrow i

00:00:25.560 --> 00:00:27.589 
me and i was very slow so tomorrow i
think<00:00:25.680> is<00:00:26.130> the<00:00:26.310> condition<00:00:26.760> will<00:00:26.910> be<00:00:26.939> difficult

00:00:27.589 --> 00:00:27.599 
think is the condition will be difficult

00:00:27.599 --> 00:00:29.929 
think is the condition will be difficult
and<00:00:27.810> with<00:00:28.320> the<00:00:28.470> experience<00:00:28.859> i<00:00:28.949> have<00:00:29.160> i<00:00:29.460> hope<00:00:29.640> to

00:00:29.929 --> 00:00:29.939 
and with the experience i have i hope to

00:00:29.939 --> 00:00:32.959 
and with the experience i have i hope to
stay<00:00:30.119> on<00:00:30.269> the<00:00:30.390> road<00:00:30.510> and<00:00:30.810> try<00:00:31.650> to<00:00:31.710> enjoy<00:00:32.009> so

00:00:32.959 --> 00:00:32.969 
stay on the road and try to enjoy so

00:00:32.969 --> 00:00:34.280 
stay on the road and try to enjoy so
that's<00:00:33.180> going<00:00:33.390> to<00:00:33.450> be<00:00:33.540> the<00:00:33.660> strategy<00:00:33.840> if<00:00:34.170> you

00:00:34.280 --> 00:00:34.290 
that's going to be the strategy if you

00:00:34.290 --> 00:00:37.400 
that's going to be the strategy if you
just<00:00:34.559> get<00:00:35.100> it<00:00:35.219> through<00:00:35.489> yeah<00:00:35.790> yeah<00:00:36.750> of<00:00:37.079> course

00:00:37.400 --> 00:00:37.410 
just get it through yeah yeah of course

00:00:37.410 --> 00:00:40.130 
just get it through yeah yeah of course
trying<00:00:37.920> to<00:00:38.070> do<00:00:38.219> nice<00:00:39.090> pace<00:00:39.420> because<00:00:39.719> driving

00:00:40.130 --> 00:00:40.140 
trying to do nice pace because driving

00:00:40.140 --> 00:00:44.180 
trying to do nice pace because driving
slow<00:00:40.610> it<00:00:41.610> will<00:00:42.000> bring<00:00:42.180> you<00:00:42.239> and<00:00:42.840> nowhere<00:00:43.800> but

00:00:44.180 --> 00:00:44.190 
slow it will bring you and nowhere but

00:00:44.190 --> 00:00:48.529 
slow it will bring you and nowhere but
for<00:00:45.120> sure<00:00:45.300> and<00:00:45.899> i<00:00:46.860> hope<00:00:47.039> to<00:00:47.340> have<00:00:47.820> a<00:00:47.850> clean<00:00:48.390> run

00:00:48.529 --> 00:00:48.539 
for sure and i hope to have a clean run

00:00:48.539 --> 00:00:51.290 
for sure and i hope to have a clean run
and<00:00:49.250> which<00:00:50.250> will<00:00:50.430> be<00:00:50.610> very<00:00:50.640> difficult<00:00:51.030> to

00:00:51.290 --> 00:00:51.300 
and which will be very difficult to

00:00:51.300 --> 00:00:53.630 
and which will be very difficult to
achieve<00:00:51.480> with<00:00:52.110> the<00:00:52.260> experience<00:00:52.590> and<00:00:52.829> if<00:00:53.460> the

00:00:53.630 --> 00:00:53.640 
achieve with the experience and if the

00:00:53.640 --> 00:00:56.450 
achieve with the experience and if the
conditions<00:00:54.090> stay<00:00:54.809> i<00:00:55.140> see<00:00:55.410> and<00:00:55.590> like<00:00:55.980> it<00:00:56.129> was<00:00:56.280> on

00:00:56.450 --> 00:00:56.460 
conditions stay i see and like it was on

00:00:56.460 --> 00:00:58.660 
conditions stay i see and like it was on
the<00:00:56.640> wreck<00:00:56.969> it<00:00:57.210> will<00:00:57.390> be<00:00:57.539> for<00:00:57.840> sure<00:00:57.870> easier

00:00:58.660 --> 00:00:58.670 
the wreck it will be for sure easier

00:00:58.670 --> 00:01:02.119 
the wreck it will be for sure easier
because<00:00:59.670> the<00:01:00.449> grip<00:01:00.660> level<00:01:01.020> doesn't<00:01:01.649> change<00:01:01.920> so

00:01:02.119 --> 00:01:02.129 
because the grip level doesn't change so

00:01:02.129 --> 00:01:05.420 
because the grip level doesn't change so
much<00:01:02.340> and<00:01:02.370> you<00:01:03.290> can<00:01:04.290> you<00:01:04.799> can<00:01:04.979> have<00:01:05.129> a<00:01:05.159> good

00:01:05.420 --> 00:01:05.430 
much and you can you can have a good

00:01:05.430 --> 00:01:07.580 
much and you can you can have a good
feel<00:01:05.729> and<00:01:05.939> good<00:01:06.180> confidence<00:01:06.780> but<00:01:06.990> if<00:01:07.439> the

00:01:07.580 --> 00:01:07.590 
feel and good confidence but if the

00:01:07.590 --> 00:01:11.510 
feel and good confidence but if the
condition<00:01:08.010> gets<00:01:08.159> like<00:01:09.000> last<00:01:09.689> year<00:01:09.930> or<00:01:10.250> /<00:01:11.250> in

00:01:11.510 --> 00:01:11.520 
condition gets like last year or / in

00:01:11.520 --> 00:01:14.030 
condition gets like last year or / in
the<00:01:11.729> melted<00:01:12.450> snow<00:01:12.689> it<00:01:12.930> would<00:01:13.320> be<00:01:13.500> very<00:01:13.890> very

00:01:14.030 --> 00:01:14.040 
the melted snow it would be very very

00:01:14.040 --> 00:01:15.649 
the melted snow it would be very very
difficult<00:01:14.340> to<00:01:14.700> anticipate<00:01:15.030> the<00:01:15.330> grip

00:01:15.649 --> 00:01:15.659 
difficult to anticipate the grip

00:01:15.659 --> 00:01:18.200 
difficult to anticipate the grip
condition<00:01:16.140> change<00:01:16.380> and<00:01:16.790> with<00:01:17.790> the<00:01:17.939> experience

00:01:18.200 --> 00:01:18.210 
condition change and with the experience

00:01:18.210 --> 00:01:21.620 
condition change and with the experience
i<00:01:18.420> have<00:01:18.630> it<00:01:18.869> is<00:01:19.140> for<00:01:19.680> sure<00:01:19.860> not<00:01:20.460> easy<00:01:20.670> not<00:01:21.600> a

00:01:21.620 --> 00:01:21.630 
i have it is for sure not easy not a

00:01:21.630 --> 00:01:23.120 
i have it is for sure not easy not a
huge<00:01:21.900> amount<00:01:21.990> of<00:01:22.200> experience<00:01:22.470> ever<00:01:22.890> do<00:01:23.040> you

00:01:23.120 --> 00:01:23.130 
huge amount of experience ever do you

00:01:23.130 --> 00:01:27.340 
huge amount of experience ever do you
actually<00:01:23.280> enjoy<00:01:23.729> driving<00:01:24.240> on<00:01:24.540> the<00:01:24.630> snow<00:01:26.150> yeah

00:01:27.340 --> 00:01:27.350 
actually enjoy driving on the snow yeah

00:01:27.350 --> 00:01:35.060 
actually enjoy driving on the snow yeah
it's<00:01:28.350> better<00:01:28.590> than<00:01:28.829> last<00:01:28.979> year<00:01:33.350> yeah<00:01:34.350> it<00:01:34.740> is

00:01:35.060 --> 00:01:35.070 
it's better than last year yeah it is

00:01:35.070 --> 00:01:37.130 
it's better than last year yeah it is
for<00:01:35.909> sure<00:01:36.030> the<00:01:36.060> feeling<00:01:36.479> is<00:01:36.570> better<00:01:36.750> than<00:01:36.960> last

00:01:37.130 --> 00:01:37.140 
for sure the feeling is better than last

00:01:37.140 --> 00:01:39.830 
for sure the feeling is better than last
year<00:01:37.380> but<00:01:37.530> we<00:01:38.340> have<00:01:38.490> to<00:01:38.610> remember<00:01:38.759> that<00:01:39.060> my

00:01:39.830 --> 00:01:39.840 
year but we have to remember that my

00:01:41.810 --> 00:01:41.820 
total experience on driving of snow is

00:01:41.820 --> 00:01:46.730 
total experience on driving of snow is
around<00:01:42.540> 600<00:01:43.170> kilometers<00:01:43.680> so<00:01:45.320> it's<00:01:46.320> not<00:01:46.439> a<00:01:46.500> lot

00:01:46.730 --> 00:01:46.740 
around 600 kilometers so it's not a lot

00:01:46.740 --> 00:01:50.080
