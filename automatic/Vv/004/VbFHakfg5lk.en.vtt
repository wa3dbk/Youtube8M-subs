today<00:00:00.960> we<00:00:01.290> will<00:00:01.469> be<00:00:01.589> comparing<00:00:01.979> and

00:00:02.270 --> 00:00:02.280 
today we will be comparing and

00:00:02.280 --> 00:00:07.039 
today we will be comparing and
contrasting<00:00:02.399> camp<00:00:03.240> plants<00:00:03.629> to<00:00:03.750> c4<00:00:04.230> plants<00:00:06.049> we

contrasting camp plants to c4 plants we

00:00:07.049 --> 00:00:09.770 
contrasting camp plants to c4 plants we
will<00:00:07.200> start<00:00:07.500> with<00:00:07.620> the<00:00:07.799> c4<00:00:08.280> plant<00:00:08.580> c4<00:00:09.269> means

00:00:09.770 --> 00:00:09.780 
will start with the c4 plant c4 means

00:00:09.780 --> 00:00:11.360 
will start with the c4 plant c4 means
that<00:00:10.019> the<00:00:10.110> plant<00:00:10.349> uses<00:00:10.500> four<00:00:10.920> carbon

00:00:11.360 --> 00:00:11.370 
that the plant uses four carbon

00:00:11.370 --> 00:00:14.690 
that the plant uses four carbon
molecules<00:00:11.910> instead<00:00:12.389> of<00:00:12.630> three<00:00:13.070> c4<00:00:14.070> plants<00:00:14.519> use

fixation pathway is a reaction that

00:00:19.199 --> 00:00:21.349 
fixation pathway is a reaction that
takes<00:00:19.350> inorganic<00:00:20.220> carbon<00:00:20.460> and<00:00:20.820> produces

takes inorganic carbon and produces

00:00:21.359 --> 00:00:24.050 
takes inorganic carbon and produces
organic<00:00:21.570> compounds<00:00:22.500> from<00:00:22.560> it<00:00:22.920> now<00:00:23.580> we<00:00:23.640> will

the stoma of Pam plants are only open at

00:01:06.210 --> 00:01:08.120 
the stoma of Pam plants are only open at
night<00:01:06.390> because<00:01:06.900> they<00:01:07.080> normally<00:01:07.290> reside<00:01:07.860> in

the<00:01:12.000> plant<00:01:12.240> obtains<00:01:12.659> its<00:01:12.900> co2<00:01:13.140> and<00:01:13.680> turns<00:01:13.950> it

00:01:14.120 --> 00:01:14.130 
the plant obtains its co2 and turns it

00:01:14.130 --> 00:01:18.410 
the plant obtains its co2 and turns it
into<00:01:14.280> a<00:01:14.430> four<00:01:14.760> carbon<00:01:15.060> acid<00:01:15.330> Valley<00:01:17.420> then

00:01:18.410 --> 00:01:18.420 
into a four carbon acid Valley then

00:01:18.420 --> 00:01:21.200 
into a four carbon acid Valley then
during<00:01:19.290> the<00:01:19.439> day<00:01:19.619> the<00:01:20.189> plant<00:01:20.490> releases<00:01:20.759> the

during the day the plant releases the

00:01:21.210 --> 00:01:23.810 
during the day the plant releases the
co2<00:01:21.540> this<00:01:22.320> provides<00:01:22.799> the<00:01:22.950> enzyme<00:01:23.400> resist

00:01:23.810 --> 00:01:23.820 
co2 this provides the enzyme resist

00:01:23.820 --> 00:01:27.910 
co2 this provides the enzyme resist

Rubisco with a high concentration of co2
all<00:01:28.920> during<00:01:29.729> this<00:01:30.000> daytime<00:01:30.479> process<00:01:31.079> the

00:01:31.460 --> 00:01:31.470 
all during this daytime process the

00:01:31.470 --> 00:01:34.010 
all during this daytime process the
stomata<00:01:31.890> are<00:01:32.250> closed<00:01:32.729> in<00:01:33.090> order<00:01:33.420> to<00:01:33.689> reduce

00:01:34.010 --> 00:01:34.020 
stomata are closed in order to reduce

00:01:34.020 --> 00:01:37.960 
stomata are closed in order to reduce
water<00:01:34.259> loss<00:01:34.470> through<00:01:34.890> evapo<00:01:35.759> transpiration

00:01:37.960 --> 00:01:37.970 

00:01:37.970 --> 00:01:41.359 

now<00:01:38.970> let's<00:01:39.780> compare<00:01:40.229> the<00:01:40.439> two<00:01:40.470> plants<00:01:41.009> and

00:01:41.359 --> 00:01:41.369 
now let's compare the two plants and

00:01:41.369 --> 00:01:42.679 
now let's compare the two plants and
show<00:01:41.729> some<00:01:42.000> examples

00:01:42.679 --> 00:01:42.689 
show some examples

00:01:42.689 --> 00:01:46.789

our<00:01:43.759> first<00:01:44.759> difference<00:01:45.240> is<00:01:45.509> that<00:01:46.020> cam<00:01:46.350> plants

00:01:46.789 --> 00:01:46.799 
our first difference is that cam plants

00:01:46.799 --> 00:01:48.410 
our first difference is that cam plants
close<00:01:47.070> their<00:01:47.280> stomata<00:01:47.460> during<00:01:48.090> the<00:01:48.180> day

00:01:48.410 --> 00:01:48.420 
close their stomata during the day

00:01:48.420 --> 00:01:50.450 
close their stomata during the day
whereas<00:01:48.960> c4<00:01:49.470> plants<00:01:49.829> only<00:01:49.950> have<00:01:50.280> their

is that c4 plants originated in tropical

00:01:57.000 --> 00:01:59.719 
is that c4 plants originated in tropical
areas<00:01:57.420> whereas<00:01:58.140> cam<00:01:58.409> plants<00:01:58.649> originated<00:01:59.579> in

areas whereas cam plants originated in

00:01:59.729 --> 00:02:02.840 
areas whereas cam plants originated in
deserts<00:02:00.380> our<00:02:01.380> last<00:02:01.680> difference<00:02:02.130> is<00:02:02.340> that<00:02:02.579> cam
