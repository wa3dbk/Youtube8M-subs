00:01:34.259 --> 00:01:37.799
 with a screen slightly smaller than 5 

00:01:36.570 --> 00:01:40.020
 inches 

00:01:37.799 --> 00:01:43.439
 the company must present a new model 

00:01:40.020 --> 00:01:46.020
 during the mwc that happens at the beginning of 

00:01:43.439 --> 00:01:48.869
 the month of March, which seems to indicate 

00:01:46.020 --> 00:01:51.149
 specifications will be the same only for 

00:01:48.869 --> 00:01:54.630
 This new model's screen will look different 

00:01:51.149 --> 00:01:57.479
 but it is speculated that this model may have 

00:01:54.630 --> 00:01:59.850
 versions with 2 or 4 GB of RAM 

00:01:57.479 --> 00:02:01.540
 the information is flora and enter 

00:01:59.850 --> 00:02:03.490
 the site was ruin 

00:02:01.540 --> 00:02:07.510
 now take a look at what a 

00:02:03.490 --> 00:02:09.700
 cake programmer is the brand killer 

00:02:07.510 --> 00:02:12.430
 we explain what it is he used 

00:02:09.700 --> 00:02:14.410
 screens and lenses similar to those of the glasses 

00:02:12.430 --> 00:02:16.390
 rift to create a device that 

00:02:14.410 --> 00:02:19.870
 person uses to interact with the environment 

00:02:16.390 --> 00:02:22.810
 and then this device does not identify any 

00:02:19.870 --> 00:02:25.050
 nor does it advertise the images of these marks 

00:02:22.810 --> 00:02:28.600
 they are blurred and have no ads 

00:02:25.050 --> 00:02:31.420
 advertising packaging etc. and everything 

00:02:28.600 --> 00:02:34.120
 happens in real time this system has 

00:02:31.420 --> 00:02:37.420
 open source, anyone can 

00:02:34.120 --> 00:02:40.180
 know more details of him other 

00:02:37.420 --> 00:02:42.340
 A curious invention is that hammer 

00:02:40.180 --> 00:02:45.220
 that the homer uses in an episode 

00:02:42.340 --> 00:02:47.530
 of simpsons is a guy got him hammer 

00:02:45.220 --> 00:02:48.790
 and made a pet version that forbids it has 

00:02:47.530 --> 00:02:51.250
 a channel on youtube 

00:02:48.790 --> 00:02:53.830
 he created a recreation of that hammer he 

00:02:51.250 --> 00:02:56.440
 uses an electromagnetic coil that 

00:02:53.830 --> 00:02:58.959
 pushes a cylindrical rod and 

00:02:56.440 --> 00:03:01.360
 moves the tip of the tool 

00:02:58.959 --> 00:03:04.600
 lithium battery thousand million perez 

00:03:01.360 --> 00:03:07.000
 hour feeds the contraption structure 

00:03:04.600 --> 00:03:10.350
 it's aluminum 

00:03:07.000 --> 00:03:14.080
 now this one was too much a school 

00:03:10.350 --> 00:03:16.420
 confused ipad with the macbook pro joke 

00:03:14.080 --> 00:03:19.750
 on the internet you are seeing this ad 

00:03:16.420 --> 00:03:22.180
 There's something very strange about him there. 

00:03:19.750 --> 00:03:24.100
 the students are using a macbook as 

00:03:22.180 --> 00:03:26.860
 if it were an ipad 

00:03:24.100 --> 00:03:28.810
 the ad is from siec de bocaiÃºva school 

00:03:26.860 --> 00:03:32.500
 in Minas Gerais 

00:03:28.810 --> 00:03:34.360
 there you know the internet does not forgive 

00:03:32.500 --> 00:03:37.540
 so they started to make several 

00:03:34.360 --> 00:03:39.880
 assemblies with the situation put the 

00:03:37.540 --> 00:03:45.420
 girls looking at everything that's kind of 

00:03:39.880 --> 00:03:48.459
 internet appliance does not even forgive 

00:03:45.420 --> 00:03:51.010
 and we will finish the video today 

00:03:48.459 --> 00:03:54.099
 a very nice reading recommendation 

00:03:51.010 --> 00:03:56.980
 it's worth it to check out the 

00:03:54.099 --> 00:03:59.620
 special the windows 10 the great weapons 

00:03:56.980 --> 00:04:02.470

00:03:59.620 --> 00:04:05.319
 combat it brings the main weapons with 

00:04:02.470 --> 00:04:07.930
 which Microsoft starts 2015 and 

00:04:05.319 --> 00:04:10.060
 we confront each of them with the 

00:04:07.930 --> 00:04:12.639
 difficult missions that the company will 

00:04:10.060 --> 00:04:16.720
