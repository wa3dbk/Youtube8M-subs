00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.179
 hello we will see today 

00:00:01.199 --> 00:00:05.840
 how to protect your tank from 

00:00:03.179 --> 00:00:05.840
 external parasites 

00:00:10.810 --> 00:00:15.490
 it's important of course for us because 

00:00:13.600 --> 00:00:17.080
 that we have not really wanted 

00:00:15.490 --> 00:00:18.460
 to be invaded by fleas but 

00:00:17.080 --> 00:00:22.119
 it's also important for health 

00:00:18.460 --> 00:00:24.400
 of cat because fleas besides all 

00:00:22.119 --> 00:00:25.930
 itching itching itching 

00:00:24.400 --> 00:00:27.580
 skin lesions they can 

00:00:25.930 --> 00:00:31.720
 also transmit some pests 

00:00:27.580 --> 00:00:34.150
 likewise with the tics its external hosts 

00:00:31.720 --> 00:00:35.470
 unwanted cat can their 

00:00:34.150 --> 00:00:38.610
 transmit diseases that can 

00:00:35.470 --> 00:00:38.610
 to be potentially deadly 

00:00:39.090 --> 00:00:43.830
 an indoor cat for me must be 

00:00:41.370 --> 00:00:46.800
 regularly treated against fleas 

00:00:43.830 --> 00:00:48.930
 because chips it's very easy to 

00:00:46.800 --> 00:00:50.170
 prevent them but to get rid of them 

00:00:48.930 --> 00:00:52.120
 as soon as 

00:00:50.170 --> 00:00:54.460
 we are infested at home this is the 

00:00:52.120 --> 00:00:56.829
 cross and the banner so a cat 

00:00:54.460 --> 00:00:58.300
 indoor only fleas a cat 

00:00:56.829 --> 00:01:00.190
 outside of course fleas and 

00:00:58.300 --> 00:01:02.079
 ticks throughout the risk period 

00:01:00.190 --> 00:01:02.649
 for ethics ie from March to 

00:01:02.079 --> 00:01:05.400
 October 

00:01:02.649 --> 00:01:08.580
 at least now come on 

00:01:05.400 --> 00:01:09.960
 a mildness beyond the month of October but 

00:01:08.580 --> 00:01:12.810
 it's during the whole period when he 

00:01:09.960 --> 00:01:14.850
 makes a temperate outside temperature 

00:01:12.810 --> 00:01:17.940
 according to the brand 

00:01:14.850 --> 00:01:19.650
 of external pest control used a 

00:01:17.940 --> 00:01:22.740
 frequency of administration that is 

00:01:19.650 --> 00:01:24.600
 different it is external pest control 

00:01:22.740 --> 00:01:26.690
 can be in the form of 

00:01:24.600 --> 00:01:29.070
 pipettes well known pipettes 

00:01:26.690 --> 00:01:31.050
 which one must break the mouthpiece is 

00:01:29.070 --> 00:01:34.320
 it is necessary to pour the contents 

00:01:31.050 --> 00:01:35.730
 in the 2 on the cat's stroke there is 

00:01:34.320 --> 00:01:37.590
 also external pest control 

00:01:35.730 --> 00:01:40.020
 in the form of tablets that exists 

00:01:37.590 --> 00:01:42.450
 also in blue bumped the whole thing is 

00:01:40.020 --> 00:01:44.160
 choose with your veterinarian the method 

00:01:42.450 --> 00:01:46.080
 of administration and of course the 

00:01:44.160 --> 00:01:47.250
 frequency of administration adapted to 

00:01:46.080 --> 00:01:49.830
 this method 

00:01:47.250 --> 00:01:51.690
 so the pest pipettes the 

00:01:49.830 --> 00:01:53.790
 frequency of administration the major 

00:01:51.690 --> 00:01:58.260
 part of the time it's every month 

00:01:53.790 --> 00:02:01.340
 so we're going out in fact obviously 

00:01:58.260 --> 00:02:01.340
 frustrated but my swimming 

00:02:01.940 --> 00:02:07.560
 we must break 

00:02:03.720 --> 00:02:11.910
 the tip of the beast and place the content 

00:02:07.560 --> 00:02:14.250
 of the pipette between the hairs so on 

00:02:11.910 --> 00:02:18.269
 the skin and place the pipette in its 

00:02:14.250 --> 00:02:20.940
 entirety on the skin in the blow of the 

00:02:18.269 --> 00:02:22.830
 cat why at this location but 

00:02:20.940 --> 00:02:24.480
 simply because in his neck 

00:02:22.830 --> 00:02:28.019
 the cat does not arrive and that to lick 

00:02:24.480 --> 00:02:30.920
 and so he will not go lick the content 

00:02:28.019 --> 00:02:30.920
 pipette 

00:02:32.430 --> 00:02:37.090
 watch the pest pipettes 

00:02:34.989 --> 00:02:38.920
 for dogs are not at all 

00:02:37.090 --> 00:02:40.209
 apply on a cat the cat but not 

00:02:38.920 --> 00:02:41.709
 a little dog so the pipettes 

00:02:40.209 --> 00:02:43.599
 Pest control for dogs are 

00:02:41.709 --> 00:02:44.830
 toxic to cats so it's not 

00:02:43.599 --> 00:02:47.110
 the same products that are complete 

00:02:44.830 --> 00:02:47.940
 so we do not pour the pipettes 

00:02:47.110 --> 00:02:50.470
 one and the other 

00:02:47.940 --> 00:02:52.239
 also for necklaces one does 

00:02:50.470 --> 00:02:53.530
 attention to the toxicity of the neck 

00:02:52.239 --> 00:02:54.280
 necklaces there are plenty of gaulle and who 

00:02:53.530 --> 00:02:57.160
 are on sale 

00:02:54.280 --> 00:02:58.600
 still today we supermarkets and 

00:02:57.160 --> 00:03:00.010
 contain products that are potest 

00:02:58.600 --> 00:03:02.890
 I think potentially toxic to 

00:03:00.010 --> 00:03:04.209
 the cat if we use a college have 

00:03:02.890 --> 00:03:07.330
 be careful to use a 

00:03:04.209 --> 00:03:09.400
 collar that come off easily and 

00:03:07.330 --> 00:03:11.799
 who breaks the cat did not have to 

00:03:09.400 --> 00:03:13.510
 choke on the outside in 

00:03:11.799 --> 00:03:16.150
 clinging to his anti collar 

00:03:13.510 --> 00:03:18.220
 parasites time and there is also 

00:03:16.150 --> 00:03:20.319
 I have not spoken but shampoos 

00:03:18.220 --> 00:03:22.480
 parasitic candy me I do not advise 

00:03:20.319 --> 00:03:23.830
 not at all for cats simply 

00:03:22.480 --> 00:03:25.299
 because they contain products 

00:03:23.830 --> 00:03:28.650
 which can potentially also 

00:03:25.299 --> 00:03:28.650
 be toxic crown charm
