00:00:00.280 --> 00:00:02.480
I don’t care how well-traveled you are

00:00:02.480 --> 00:00:04.560
you’ve  never seen a subway system as

00:00:04.560 --> 00:00:05.880
ancient, 

00:00:06.020 --> 00:00:07.140
filthy,

00:00:07.300 --> 00:00:08.620
horribly loud,

00:00:08.900 --> 00:00:09.860
and confusing

00:00:10.220 --> 00:00:12.080
 as New York’s.

00:00:12.600 --> 00:00:13.600
But in spite of it all,

00:00:13.700 --> 00:00:16.160
it’s still the best subway in the world.

00:00:16.540 --> 00:00:17.480
How is that possible?

00:00:17.740 --> 00:00:20.180
Your Gringo Friend will explain.

00:00:27.420 --> 00:00:29.920
Why is the New York City subway the best?

00:00:30.240 --> 00:00:33.240
Because you can get anywhere  in the city

00:00:33.420 --> 00:00:36.840
24 hours a day, 365 days a year.

00:00:37.040 --> 00:00:38.480
 Not even London can say that.

00:00:38.980 --> 00:00:44.220
Unfortunately, you can also get lost 24 hours a day,

00:00:44.300 --> 00:00:46.160
365 days a year.

00:00:46.340 --> 00:00:48.640
And if you don’t know how to behave,

00:00:48.940 --> 00:00:51.400
it’s also possible to be a total idiot 

00:00:51.400 --> 00:00:54.760
24 hours a day, 365 days a year.

00:00:55.120 --> 00:00:58.300
Let’s get to some tips about proper subway behavior.

00:00:58.440 --> 00:00:59.360
First,

00:00:59.380 --> 00:01:02.000
how do you use that yellow MetroCard?

00:01:02.460 --> 00:01:06.300
All the rational subway systems in the world work like this.

00:01:06.620 --> 00:01:08.820
Take your card, touch it on the sensor,

00:01:08.840 --> 00:01:10.620
hear a beep, and head on through.

00:01:11.380 --> 00:01:12.760
But with the Metrocard, 

00:01:12.900 --> 00:01:15.600
which really should be called the IdiotCard,

00:01:16.040 --> 00:01:19.280
you need to learn how to swipe your card though the machine 

00:01:19.340 --> 00:01:20.880
New York style.

00:01:21.040 --> 00:01:22.200
 It seems easy

00:01:22.480 --> 00:01:24.640
just swipe the card, and go. 

00:01:24.760 --> 00:01:26.800
But it can be quite difficult.

00:01:26.960 --> 00:01:30.400
Don’t go through until the screen says “Go” or…

00:01:30.720 --> 00:01:32.200
That hurt!

00:01:32.320 --> 00:01:36.080
That’s why I always use my hand to push the turnstile.

00:01:36.280 --> 00:01:38.080
So if the card didn’t work,

00:01:38.080 --> 00:01:38.980
no problem. 

00:01:39.480 --> 00:01:40.040
Now, 

00:01:40.080 --> 00:01:42.320
how to behave on the platform. 

00:01:42.680 --> 00:01:43.840
OK, listen up:

00:01:44.040 --> 00:01:45.520
when the train arrives, 

00:01:45.600 --> 00:01:49.120
always let passengers exit the car first. 

00:01:49.480 --> 00:01:51.800
In São Paulo and Rio, Brazilians,

00:01:51.800 --> 00:01:53.600
usually very nice people,

00:01:53.720 --> 00:01:57.920
become total idiots and try to enter the train before people come out,

00:01:58.040 --> 00:02:01.200
getting in everyone’s way and delaying everyone.

00:02:01.280 --> 00:02:03.200
Here, you just can’t do that. 

00:02:03.760 --> 00:02:06.000
OK, you’re in the train.

00:02:06.000 --> 00:02:07.480
See the post? 

00:02:07.480 --> 00:02:08.700
Grab it with your hand.

00:02:08.880 --> 00:02:12.000
Don’t hug the post as if it were your girlfriend,

00:02:12.000 --> 00:02:14.040
other people need it too.

00:02:14.200 --> 00:02:16.200
And want to look cool on the train?

00:02:16.200 --> 00:02:19.040
Everyone’s reading their smartphone, 

00:02:19.040 --> 00:02:20.840
so if you want to be different,

00:02:20.920 --> 00:02:22.840
grab a sophisticated book.

00:02:22.880 --> 00:02:23.640
Who knows?

00:02:23.800 --> 00:02:26.000
You might make new friends. 

00:02:29.640 --> 00:02:31.720
What you can’t do,

00:02:31.800 --> 00:02:35.480
is hold a conversation as if you were the only people on the train.

00:02:35.520 --> 00:02:36.880
I don’t know why, 

00:02:36.880 --> 00:02:39.600
but tourists always do that! 

00:02:39.880 --> 00:02:43.280
And you don’t know if someone else speaks Portuguese.

00:02:43.520 --> 00:02:45.200
“What an idiot!” 

00:02:47.000 --> 00:02:48.240
A few more things.

00:02:48.400 --> 00:02:49.920
There are always rats. 

00:02:50.080 --> 00:02:52.200
If you see one, no big deal!

00:02:52.320 --> 00:02:53.600
Don’t even pay it any mind.

00:02:53.840 --> 00:02:55.360
It’s not going to bite you.

00:02:55.440 --> 00:02:57.640
Or, it’s PROBABLY not going to bite you.

00:02:57.920 --> 00:03:03.400
Ah, and those papers that appear on the walls with tiny text,

00:03:03.560 --> 00:03:05.800
that means there’s some change,

00:03:06.080 --> 00:03:09.160
and your train probably is not going where you think.

00:03:09.480 --> 00:03:11.280
So, ask for help.

00:03:11.360 --> 00:03:13.120
It’s the big secret of the subway: 

00:03:13.240 --> 00:03:16.360
it’s seems like everybody’s in a bad mood, unfriendly. 

00:03:16.680 --> 00:03:21.000
But the truth is, we actually love helping lost tourists. 

00:03:21.480 --> 00:03:22.440
I’m serious!

00:03:22.640 --> 00:03:25.760
 I think it’s because no one is really from New York,

00:03:25.840 --> 00:03:28.280
and we were all once tourists, 

00:03:28.280 --> 00:03:29.480
just like you.

00:03:29.760 --> 00:03:33.000
Well, not JUST like you. 

00:03:34.520 --> 00:03:36.200
People, thanks for watching. 

00:03:36.280 --> 00:03:38.200
Don’t forget to subscribe to the channel,

00:03:38.200 --> 00:03:40.160
so you don’t miss a single “Amigo Gringo.”

00:03:40.240 --> 00:03:43.160
And now, time for your New Yorkese lesson.

00:03:43.280 --> 00:03:44.600
Today’s word:

00:03:45.040 --> 00:03:46.080
swipe.

00:03:46.760 --> 00:03:50.760
What you do with the Metrocard to go through the turnstile.

00:03:50.840 --> 00:03:52.000
Repeat after me:

00:03:52.720 --> 00:03:53.640
 swipe. 

00:03:53.680 --> 00:03:56.160
No, it’s not swipey.

00:03:56.160 --> 00:03:58.280
It’s swipe.
