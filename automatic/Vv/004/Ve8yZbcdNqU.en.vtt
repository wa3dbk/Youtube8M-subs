00:02:02.310 --> 00:02:04.399 
our God is always watching and he's not
just<00:02:02.340> watching<00:02:02.700> the<00:02:02.909> job<00:02:03.180> we<00:02:03.420> do<00:02:03.659> but<00:02:04.290> he's

00:02:04.399 --> 00:02:04.409

00:02:06.880 --> 00:02:06.890 
watching our heart while we do it

00:02:06.890 --> 00:02:09.130
