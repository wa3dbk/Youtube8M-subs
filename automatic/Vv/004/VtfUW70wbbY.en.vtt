to a outpatient therapy follow up with

00:07:02.889 --> 00:07:05.120 
to a outpatient therapy follow up with
doctors<00:07:03.370> see<00:07:03.730> these<00:07:03.940> do<00:07:04.180> these<00:07:04.389> do<00:07:04.660> that<00:07:04.870> and

00:07:05.120 --> 00:07:05.130 
doctors see these do these do that and

00:07:05.130 --> 00:07:08.010 
doctors see these do these do that and
sadly<00:07:06.130> you<00:07:06.160> now<00:07:06.430> get<00:07:06.669> it<00:07:06.880> we<00:07:07.570> have<00:07:07.600> a<00:07:07.750> big

00:07:08.010 --> 00:07:08.020 
sadly you now get it we have a big

00:07:08.020 --> 00:07:10.770 
sadly you now get it we have a big
obstacle<00:07:08.380> you<00:07:09.310> know<00:07:09.460> how<00:07:09.580> many<00:07:09.760> people<00:07:10.210> I<00:07:10.330> fix

00:07:10.770 --> 00:07:10.780 
obstacle you know how many people I fix

00:07:10.780 --> 00:07:15.240 
obstacle you know how many people I fix
I<00:07:11.880> think<00:07:12.880> I<00:07:13.000> fix<00:07:13.270> and<00:07:13.690> they<00:07:14.500> end<00:07:14.650> up<00:07:14.770> seeing<00:07:15.160> a

00:07:15.240 --> 00:07:15.250 
I think I fix and they end up seeing a

00:07:15.250 --> 00:07:17.220 
I think I fix and they end up seeing a
doctor<00:07:15.730> who<00:07:16.060> put<00:07:16.240> in<00:07:16.419> one<00:07:16.690> of<00:07:16.840> these<00:07:16.960> things

00:07:17.220 --> 00:07:17.230 
doctor who put in one of these things

00:07:17.230 --> 00:07:22.020 
doctor who put in one of these things
and<00:07:17.650> next<00:07:19.169> they<00:07:20.169> relapse<00:07:20.590> and<00:07:21.310> back<00:07:21.490> to<00:07:21.760> square

00:07:22.020 --> 00:07:22.030 
and next they relapse and back to square

00:07:22.030 --> 00:07:25.020 
and next they relapse and back to square
zero<00:07:22.360> so<00:07:23.110> we<00:07:23.320> have<00:07:23.350> a<00:07:23.530> unique<00:07:24.280> approach<00:07:24.580> here

00:07:25.020 --> 00:07:25.030 
zero so we have a unique approach here

00:07:25.030 --> 00:07:27.000 
zero so we have a unique approach here
by<00:07:25.240> the<00:07:25.300> way<00:07:25.510> we<00:07:26.260> minimize<00:07:26.650> the<00:07:26.830> use<00:07:26.860> of

00:07:27.000 --> 00:07:27.010 
by the way we minimize the use of

00:07:27.010 --> 00:07:29.790 
by the way we minimize the use of
psychiatric<00:07:27.310> medications<00:07:27.930> we<00:07:28.930> try<00:07:29.169> to<00:07:29.230> use<00:07:29.560> as

psychiatric medications we try to use as

we use a lot of natural products and we
