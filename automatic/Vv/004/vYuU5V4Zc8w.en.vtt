00:00:00.560 --> 00:00:04.300
 very cross 

00:00:04.480 --> 00:00:10.269
 Welcome to the live 

00:00:07.720 --> 00:00:12.160
 here I bring you another video guys and this 

00:00:10.269 --> 00:00:14.230
 We're going to see a tutorial on how 

00:00:12.160 --> 00:00:15.940
 make alternative stairs this time is 

00:00:14.230 --> 00:00:17.949
 a tutorial maybe a little more 

00:00:15.940 --> 00:00:20.439
 decorative a little more already to give 

00:00:17.949 --> 00:00:22.689
 details to our constructions and 

00:00:20.439 --> 00:00:24.970
 As you know we have four types of 

00:00:22.689 --> 00:00:27.429
 stairs because the normal wood 

00:00:24.970 --> 00:00:29.949
 of brick those of stone brick and 

00:00:27.429 --> 00:00:31.570
 those of pebble have little variety of 

00:00:29.949 --> 00:00:33.760
 materials when making stairs 

00:00:31.570 --> 00:00:35.650
 and that's why I bring you this tutorial how 

00:00:33.760 --> 00:00:38.770
 works the stairs theme 

00:00:35.650 --> 00:00:39.970
 you know it 's pretty simple the only thing 

00:00:38.770 --> 00:00:42.010
 what we have to do then it is a 

00:00:39.970 --> 00:00:44.770
 kind of stairs in block form 

00:00:42.010 --> 00:00:46.840
 and on top we are putting the stairs and 

00:00:44.770 --> 00:00:48.760
 it makes us that function of good rise 

00:00:46.840 --> 00:00:51.430
 automatic or let's say a little rise 

00:00:48.760 --> 00:00:52.960
 more comfortable to other floors as you see by 

00:00:51.430 --> 00:00:54.790
 here the whole bottom part then it 

00:00:52.960 --> 00:00:55.960
 You can remove you know how it works not 

00:00:54.790 --> 00:00:58.060
 I will explain how they are put 

00:00:55.960 --> 00:01:00.460
 stairs but good is to remember it 

00:00:58.060 --> 00:01:02.440
 It is worth as you see then simply 

00:01:00.460 --> 00:01:04.780
 we move forward and we go up towards a 

00:01:02.440 --> 00:01:06.729
 top floor or something like that in 

00:01:04.780 --> 00:01:08.650
 this tutorial let's see a way 

00:01:06.729 --> 00:01:10.420
 alternative to do this function of 

00:01:08.650 --> 00:01:12.700
 comfort when it comes to uploading others 

00:01:10.420 --> 00:01:14.230
 floors but that we will do without 

00:01:12.700 --> 00:01:15.910
 those stairs 

00:01:14.230 --> 00:01:18.520
 limitation of materials that we have 

00:01:15.910 --> 00:01:20.830
 ok let's take advantage let's say a 

00:01:18.520 --> 00:01:22.330
 property of the berries that I'm going now 

00:01:20.830 --> 00:01:24.130
 to explain what I'm going to do for example 

00:01:22.330 --> 00:01:26.170
 here with some blocks of obsidian for 

00:01:24.130 --> 00:01:27.490
 that you see, we are going to put some fences and 

00:01:26.170 --> 00:01:28.750
 if you will have noticed that 

00:01:27.490 --> 00:01:30.970
 surely many of you 

00:01:28.750 --> 00:01:33.160
 you will have always noticed that we tread 

00:01:30.970 --> 00:01:35.440
 some fences makes us like a kind of 

00:01:33.160 --> 00:01:37.030
 push up and we're going to 

00:01:35.440 --> 00:01:38.410
 take advantage of this property of fences 

00:01:37.030 --> 00:01:41.220
 that is not a gray or anything like that 

00:01:38.410 --> 00:01:43.930
 but that's how we're going to take advantage of this 

00:01:41.220 --> 00:01:46.000
 rare property of fences to make 

00:01:43.930 --> 00:01:47.770
 some stairs and how are we going to do it 

00:01:46.000 --> 00:01:50.350
 since the start of the stairs would be 

00:01:47.770 --> 00:01:51.400
 very easy we're just going to do two 

00:01:50.350 --> 00:01:54.370
 holes 

00:01:51.400 --> 00:01:56.050
 at ground level to put two fences 

00:01:54.370 --> 00:01:58.180
 this would be what is the beginning of the 

00:01:56.050 --> 00:02:00.100
 stairs to continue the stairs 

00:01:58.180 --> 00:02:01.470
 my recommendation the stairs with 

00:02:00.100 --> 00:02:03.870
 fences 

00:02:01.470 --> 00:02:06.600
 I would recommend that you always leave a 

00:02:03.870 --> 00:02:09.360
 space in between and your vice one level in 

00:02:06.600 --> 00:02:11.880
 the fences and you see it let's say that 

00:02:09.360 --> 00:02:13.500
 it was at ground level and the other one is 

00:02:11.880 --> 00:02:16.590
 a little more on we left another 

00:02:13.500 --> 00:02:18.840
 block of space in between and we can 

00:02:16.590 --> 00:02:20.100
 do another level and so I continuously go 

00:02:18.840 --> 00:02:22.230
 to make several levels for you to see 

00:02:20.100 --> 00:02:24.180
 what is done and how is this completed 

00:02:22.230 --> 00:02:27.360
 it's not just the ladder with this just not 

00:02:24.180 --> 00:02:29.580
 works and well the same with fences 

00:02:27.360 --> 00:02:31.890
 We can make stairs as wide as 

00:02:29.580 --> 00:02:33.240
 We want good that I leave it to you 

00:02:31.890 --> 00:02:35.000
 you but good I have done it of 

00:02:33.240 --> 00:02:37.680
 two blocks wide for you to see 

00:02:35.000 --> 00:02:40.440
 equal and good this height more or less 

00:02:37.680 --> 00:02:42.990
 would serve us so let's see how it 

00:02:40.440 --> 00:02:45.600
 would complete this then with the fences and 

00:02:42.990 --> 00:02:47.010
 any other type of material we can 

00:02:45.600 --> 00:02:48.600
 make these stairs we are going to remove 

00:02:47.010 --> 00:02:49.880
 all the bottom as we have done 

00:02:48.600 --> 00:02:51.980
 before 

00:02:49.880 --> 00:02:54.170
 in the other system of normal berries the 

00:02:51.980 --> 00:02:55.970
 that we normally use to be 

00:02:54.170 --> 00:02:57.740
 see that it does not occupy space below or 

00:02:55.970 --> 00:02:58.910
 nothing like that is good for you to see 

00:02:57.740 --> 00:03:01.400
 what can be done with any 

00:02:58.910 --> 00:03:03.410
 material I'm going to try the first thing with 

00:03:01.400 --> 00:03:05.690
 the metal gates that they added in the 

00:03:03.410 --> 00:03:06.950
 version 182 that we have to do to 

00:03:05.690 --> 00:03:09.200
 complete the ladder simply because 

00:03:06.950 --> 00:03:10.850
 let's put the blocks which I tell you 

00:03:09.200 --> 00:03:12.260
 what can you do in any way 

00:03:10.850 --> 00:03:14.000
 now we will see it with different blocks 

00:03:12.260 --> 00:03:16.700
 between the gaps we have left in the 

00:03:14.000 --> 00:03:19.220
 fences we are just moving forward and 

00:03:16.700 --> 00:03:21.230
 we are putting as you see in the just in 

00:03:19.220 --> 00:03:22.640
 the gaps in front of the fences 

00:03:21.230 --> 00:03:24.650
 putting the materials that we want 

00:03:22.640 --> 00:03:26.660
 put for the stairs the truth that 

00:03:24.650 --> 00:03:27.830
 it does not look like a staircase that does 

00:03:26.660 --> 00:03:30.930
 is going to light so I'm going to 

00:03:27.830 --> 00:03:33.569
 put again by day there we have it and 

00:03:30.930 --> 00:03:36.000
 the truth that does not seem even a 

00:03:33.569 --> 00:03:37.799
 staircase but it does exactly the same 

00:03:36.000 --> 00:03:39.840
 function that the original stairs the 

00:03:37.799 --> 00:03:41.909
 original idea is very simple simply 

00:03:39.840 --> 00:03:43.349
 advancing along that line that we have 

00:03:41.909 --> 00:03:46.590
 made the stairs like in the 

00:03:43.349 --> 00:03:48.510
 another side and we are moving forward and we are going to 

00:03:46.590 --> 00:03:49.620
 automatically raise the inclination of 

00:03:48.510 --> 00:03:51.629
 the stairs so it's a bit 

00:03:49.620 --> 00:03:53.430
 different since the normal stairs 

00:03:51.629 --> 00:03:55.019
 yes they go up a little faster and these 

00:03:53.430 --> 00:03:57.060
 let's say it has a tilt a 

00:03:55.019 --> 00:03:59.730
 little bit but they do exactly the 

00:03:57.060 --> 00:04:01.349
 same function how can we use it 

00:03:59.730 --> 00:04:03.659
 with any other material as well 

00:04:01.349 --> 00:04:05.519
 simple replacing those gaps that 

00:04:03.659 --> 00:04:07.980
 we have seen simply in front of the 

00:04:05.519 --> 00:04:09.689
 fences we will put any kind of 

00:04:07.980 --> 00:04:11.760
 material not like with the stairs 

00:04:09.689 --> 00:04:13.109
 normal that only allows us to do it 

00:04:11.760 --> 00:04:15.030
 those four types that we've seen at 

00:04:13.109 --> 00:04:16.590
 principle of the tutorial the truth is that 

00:04:15.030 --> 00:04:18.780
 it's very interesting for example in this 

00:04:16.590 --> 00:04:20.190
 case if we have a construction of 

00:04:18.780 --> 00:04:22.289
 obsidian is much better to make a 

00:04:20.190 --> 00:04:24.090
 ladder of that style with obsidian that 

00:04:22.289 --> 00:04:26.699
 put it on the stairs of other types 

00:04:24.090 --> 00:04:28.770
 that the truth is that no, there would not be 

00:04:26.699 --> 00:04:31.289
 well in construction and as you can see 

00:04:28.770 --> 00:04:32.639
 exactly the same function surely 

00:04:31.289 --> 00:04:34.259
 you will be asking how can you 

00:04:32.639 --> 00:04:36.360
 make turns in this type of stairs 

00:04:34.259 --> 00:04:37.569
 so very simple let's make a 

00:04:36.360 --> 00:04:39.039
 platform like 

00:04:37.569 --> 00:04:40.990
 and in this case as I have done 

00:04:39.039 --> 00:04:43.779
 stairs of 2 wide I have put it of 

00:04:40.990 --> 00:04:45.159
 2 wide the platform of 2 x 2 and that 

00:04:43.779 --> 00:04:49.209
 we have to do it because we simply follow 

00:04:45.159 --> 00:04:51.459
 building say let's go to the height 

00:04:49.209 --> 00:04:53.559
 of the platform and we would have another 

00:04:51.459 --> 00:04:55.149
 level, I always recommend that you 

00:04:53.559 --> 00:04:57.399
 When you do build it as I have 

00:04:55.149 --> 00:04:59.259
 done at the beginning building fences 

00:04:57.399 --> 00:05:01.389
 leaving a hole building fences and 

00:04:59.259 --> 00:05:03.639
 so it's good because because if you can not 

00:05:01.389 --> 00:05:07.749
 confuse even here I have bundled a 

00:05:03.639 --> 00:05:09.249
 little and I think that put wrong is the block 

00:05:07.749 --> 00:05:10.599
 obsidian I think it has to be a 

00:05:09.249 --> 00:05:12.849
 highest block 

00:05:10.599 --> 00:05:15.039
 I'll correct it there we have it there yes 

00:05:12.849 --> 00:05:17.589
 that would be fine and this then 

00:05:15.039 --> 00:05:20.069
 it is simply increasing in level as 

00:05:17.589 --> 00:05:23.050
 I tell you, I always recommend always 

00:05:20.069 --> 00:05:25.209
 build the fences first for this 

00:05:23.050 --> 00:05:26.740
 type of stairs is worth and as you can see 

00:05:25.209 --> 00:05:29.769
 turn then the bottom part is done 

00:05:26.740 --> 00:05:32.409
 of the fences could be removed and as 

00:05:29.769 --> 00:05:35.080
 you see it works normally we have here 

00:05:32.409 --> 00:05:36.699
 the turn and there would be the truth that remains 

00:05:35.080 --> 00:05:38.979
 quite interesting the subject of the turn 

00:05:36.699 --> 00:05:41.740
 also aesthetically and good 

00:05:38.979 --> 00:05:43.419
 visually it looks good and as it was 

00:05:41.740 --> 00:05:44.260
 saying before it does not just work for 

00:05:43.419 --> 00:05:46.180
 example with these 

00:05:44.260 --> 00:05:49.150
 what we have seen if not with any 

00:05:46.180 --> 00:05:50.590
 kind of material imagine here we are 

00:05:49.150 --> 00:05:52.270
 making a glass building 

00:05:50.590 --> 00:05:54.130
 We could use this method to 

00:05:52.270 --> 00:05:56.590
 make some glass stairs 

00:05:54.130 --> 00:05:57.850
 simply replacing those spaces 

00:05:56.590 --> 00:05:59.620
 that we have between the fences with the 

00:05:57.850 --> 00:06:01.330
 material that we want guys works 

00:05:59.620 --> 00:06:03.400
 for any type of construction and 

00:06:01.330 --> 00:06:06.040
 there will always be much much better 

00:06:03.400 --> 00:06:07.420
 this method of stairs that the 

00:06:06.040 --> 00:06:08.980
 normal stairs imagine a 

00:06:07.420 --> 00:06:10.780
 glass building with some stairs 

00:06:08.980 --> 00:06:12.820
 of wood the truth that does not hit for 

00:06:10.780 --> 00:06:14.680
 nothing and with this method then we can 

00:06:12.820 --> 00:06:16.150
 save having to do those 

00:06:14.680 --> 00:06:17.410
 stairs with the materials that we 

00:06:16.150 --> 00:06:18.940
 offers minecraft at least until the 

00:06:17.410 --> 00:06:21.220
 moment the truth that is a method 

00:06:18.940 --> 00:06:22.960
 very good alternative I hope you give 

00:06:21.220 --> 00:06:25.150
 ideas to continue building and 

00:06:22.960 --> 00:06:26.950
 decorating guys this is let's say give a 

00:06:25.150 --> 00:06:29.050
 point more to the constructions a point 

00:06:26.950 --> 00:06:31.210
 more amazing decoration for me to 

00:06:29.050 --> 00:06:32.920
 least I like it very much I hope that you 

00:06:31.210 --> 00:06:34.420
 how do I tell you new ideas because it 's 

00:06:32.920 --> 00:06:36.460
 what I always look for doing this guy 

00:06:34.420 --> 00:06:37.840
 of tutorials let's say open a little bit 

00:06:36.460 --> 00:06:39.460
 more the mind the ideas of minecraft 

00:06:37.840 --> 00:06:41.170
 you never finish you have to follow 

00:06:39.460 --> 00:06:43.030
 building because the truth that 

00:06:41.170 --> 00:06:44.800
 we have a lot to see even in minecraft 

00:06:43.030 --> 00:06:47.710
 I hope you liked this tutorial 

00:06:44.800 --> 00:06:49.060
 guys just left like in the 

00:06:47.710 --> 00:06:50.260
 video if you liked it if you called 

00:06:49.060 --> 00:06:51.910
 the attention the truth 

00:06:50.260 --> 00:06:54.160
 It helps a lot the subject of the likes 

00:06:51.910 --> 00:06:55.570
 psuv for more videos as always and nothing 

00:06:54.160 --> 00:07:00.180
 I hope that soon we will see each other in new 

00:06:55.570 --> 00:07:00.180
 videos a saludito and see you later
