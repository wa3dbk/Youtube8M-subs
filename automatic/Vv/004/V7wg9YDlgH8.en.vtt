00:01:20.680 --> 00:01:20.690 
up my needle actually is stitch by

00:01:20.690 --> 00:01:25.900 
up my needle actually is stitch by
stitch<00:01:20.720> I<00:01:22.150> will<00:01:23.150> take<00:01:23.390> it<00:01:23.570> off<00:01:24.580> pull<00:01:25.580> out<00:01:25.760> the

00:01:25.900 --> 00:01:25.910 
stitch I will take it off pull out the

00:01:25.910 --> 00:01:29.260 
stitch I will take it off pull out the
old<00:01:26.830> the<00:01:27.830> last<00:01:28.040> row<00:01:28.340> and<00:01:28.610> put<00:01:28.820> it<00:01:28.940> on<00:01:29.120> the

00:01:29.260 --> 00:01:29.270 
old the last row and put it on the

00:01:29.270 --> 00:01:31.090 
old the last row and put it on the
needle<00:01:29.360> just<00:01:29.720> as<00:01:30.140> it's<00:01:30.320> being<00:01:30.500> pulled<00:01:30.740> out<00:01:30.860> and

00:01:31.090 --> 00:01:31.100 
needle just as it's being pulled out and

00:01:31.100 --> 00:01:36.120 
needle just as it's being pulled out and
so<00:01:31.130> this<00:01:31.640> row<00:01:32.000> then<00:01:32.300> serves<00:01:32.630> as<00:01:32.900> a<00:01:32.930> guide<00:01:35.020> so

00:01:36.120 --> 00:01:36.130 
so this row then serves as a guide so

00:01:36.130 --> 00:01:43.179 
so this row then serves as a guide so
just<00:01:37.130> going<00:01:37.640> in<00:01:37.790> from<00:01:38.000> behind<00:01:38.260> pulling<00:01:39.260> out

00:01:43.179 --> 00:01:43.189 

00:01:43.189 --> 00:01:45.880 

and<00:01:43.939> don't<00:01:44.539> forget<00:01:44.719> to<00:01:44.990> pick<00:01:45.140> up<00:01:45.319> this<00:01:45.530> yarn

00:01:45.880 --> 00:01:45.890 
and don't forget to pick up this yarn

00:01:45.890 --> 00:01:51.760 
and don't forget to pick up this yarn
over<00:01:47.829> much<00:01:48.829> easier<00:01:49.249> to<00:01:49.429> grab<00:01:49.939> then<00:01:50.450> the<00:01:51.350> other

00:01:51.760 --> 00:01:51.770 
over much easier to grab then the other

00:01:51.770 --> 00:01:57.010 
over much easier to grab then the other
row

00:01:57.010 --> 00:01:57.020 

00:01:57.020 --> 00:02:04.300 

and<00:01:57.560> put<00:01:57.799> that<00:01:57.829> right<00:01:58.040> back<00:01:58.220> on<00:02:02.259> and<00:02:03.259> so<00:02:03.530> here

00:02:04.300 --> 00:02:04.310 
and put that right back on and so here

00:02:04.310 --> 00:02:09.190 
and put that right back on and so here
also<00:02:04.520> we<00:02:06.220> are<00:02:07.220> avoiding<00:02:08.030> this<00:02:08.599> is<00:02:08.810> basically

00:02:09.190 --> 00:02:09.200 
also we are avoiding this is basically

00:02:09.200 --> 00:02:15.280 
also we are avoiding this is basically
the<00:02:09.500> we're<00:02:10.009> putting<00:02:10.340> the<00:02:10.459> row<00:02:13.540> if<00:02:14.540> another

00:02:15.280 --> 00:02:15.290 
the we're putting the row if another

00:02:15.290 --> 00:02:16.690 
the we're putting the row if another
thing<00:02:15.560> about<00:02:15.680> that<00:02:16.010> other<00:02:16.160> row<00:02:16.400> that<00:02:16.580> we

00:02:16.690 --> 00:02:16.700 
thing about that other row that we

00:02:16.700 --> 00:02:18.670 
thing about that other row that we
wouldn't<00:02:17.330> have<00:02:17.450> liked<00:02:17.690> is<00:02:17.930> not<00:02:18.290> only<00:02:18.500> do<00:02:18.590> we

00:02:18.670 --> 00:02:18.680 
wouldn't have liked is not only do we

00:02:18.680 --> 00:02:20.589 
wouldn't have liked is not only do we
have<00:02:18.709> that<00:02:18.830> get<00:02:19.190> away<00:02:19.489> stitch<00:02:20.209> that<00:02:20.420> work

00:02:20.589 --> 00:02:20.599 
have that get away stitch that work

00:02:20.599 --> 00:02:23.140 
have that get away stitch that work
those<00:02:20.840> worked<00:02:21.110> into<00:02:21.440> the<00:02:21.620> yarn<00:02:22.610> over<00:02:22.880> but<00:02:23.060> we

00:02:23.140 --> 00:02:23.150 
those worked into the yarn over but we

00:02:23.150 --> 00:02:25.750 
those worked into the yarn over but we
have<00:02:23.330> to<00:02:23.920> we<00:02:24.920> also<00:02:25.040> have<00:02:25.310> the<00:02:25.430> knit<00:02:25.610> two

00:02:25.750 --> 00:02:25.760 
have to we also have the knit two

00:02:25.760 --> 00:02:28.570 
have to we also have the knit two
togethers<00:02:26.150> and<00:02:26.450> SS<00:02:27.110> KS<00:02:27.410> to<00:02:27.739> contend<00:02:28.130> with<00:02:28.190> on

00:02:28.570 --> 00:02:28.580 
togethers and SS KS to contend with on

00:02:28.580 --> 00:02:30.460 
togethers and SS KS to contend with on
that<00:02:28.730> row<00:02:28.910> and<00:02:28.940> whereas<00:02:29.690> in<00:02:29.840> this<00:02:29.930> row<00:02:30.110> we<00:02:30.260> just

00:02:30.460 --> 00:02:30.470 
that row and whereas in this row we just

00:02:30.470 --> 00:02:36.539 
that row and whereas in this row we just
have<00:02:31.810> the<00:02:33.040> it<00:02:34.040> has<00:02:34.220> been<00:02:34.250> completed<00:02:35.120> so<00:02:35.480> we<00:02:35.690> can

00:02:36.539 --> 00:02:36.549 
have the it has been completed so we can

00:02:36.549 --> 00:02:41.620 
have the it has been completed so we can
just<00:02:37.549> put<00:02:37.819> that<00:02:38.739> completed<00:02:39.739> SS<00:02:40.670> k<00:02:40.940> on<00:02:41.209> the

00:02:41.620 --> 00:02:41.630 
just put that completed SS k on the

00:02:41.630 --> 00:02:42.520 
just put that completed SS k on the
needle

00:02:42.520 --> 00:02:42.530 
needle

00:02:42.530 --> 00:02:48.020 
needle
it's<00:02:42.769> easier

00:02:48.020 --> 00:02:48.030 

00:02:48.030 --> 00:02:51.290 

so<00:02:48.740> hit<00:02:49.740> this<00:02:49.920> over<00:02:50.280> this<00:02:50.550> is<00:02:50.760> another<00:02:50.970> yarn

00:02:51.290 --> 00:02:51.300 
so hit this over this is another yarn

00:02:51.300 --> 00:02:58.360 
so hit this over this is another yarn
over<00:02:51.630> I<00:02:51.660> don't<00:02:51.810> want<00:02:52.080> to<00:02:52.140> miss<00:02:54.530> and<00:02:55.530> lastly

00:02:58.360 --> 00:02:58.370 
over I don't want to miss and lastly

00:02:58.370 --> 00:03:07.460 
over I don't want to miss and lastly
those<00:02:59.370> and<00:02:59.760> here<00:03:00.000> was<00:03:00.120> an<00:03:00.240> SSK<00:03:00.600> so<00:03:00.870> I<00:03:06.380> think<00:03:07.380> I

00:03:07.460 --> 00:03:07.470 
those and here was an SSK so I think I

00:03:07.470 --> 00:03:09.740 
those and here was an SSK so I think I
must<00:03:07.680> be<00:03:07.830> on<00:03:07.950> yes<00:03:08.730> yeah<00:03:08.970> I<00:03:09.000> managed<00:03:09.420> to<00:03:09.570> get

00:03:09.740 --> 00:03:09.750 
must be on yes yeah I managed to get

00:03:09.750 --> 00:03:13.400 
must be on yes yeah I managed to get
onto<00:03:09.930> the<00:03:10.170> previous<00:03:10.440> row<00:03:11.840> with<00:03:12.840> that<00:03:13.080> because

00:03:13.400 --> 00:03:13.410 
onto the previous row with that because

00:03:13.410 --> 00:03:17.360 
onto the previous row with that because
I<00:03:13.440> had<00:03:13.590> a<00:03:13.620> slip<00:03:13.920> stitch<00:03:14.100> edge<00:03:15.590> that's<00:03:16.590> why<00:03:16.890> I'm

00:03:17.360 --> 00:03:17.370 
I had a slip stitch edge that's why I'm

00:03:17.370 --> 00:03:18.920 
I had a slip stitch edge that's why I'm
suddenly<00:03:17.610> contend<00:03:18.120> me<00:03:18.209> with<00:03:18.330> Dennis's<00:03:18.690> case

00:03:18.920 --> 00:03:18.930 
suddenly contend me with Dennis's case

00:03:18.930 --> 00:03:22.940 
suddenly contend me with Dennis's case
so<00:03:19.170> we<00:03:19.350> basically<00:03:20.190> are<00:03:20.550> putting<00:03:21.030> it<00:03:21.150> on<00:03:21.950> on

00:03:22.940 --> 00:03:22.950 
so we basically are putting it on on

00:03:22.950 --> 00:03:28.010 
so we basically are putting it on on
that<00:03:23.190> row<00:03:23.489> and<00:03:23.700> and<00:03:24.680> we're<00:03:25.680> good<00:03:25.890> to<00:03:25.920> go
