00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.310
 huawei big softwares 

00:00:12.280 --> 00:00:17.619
 to all seven guys welcome to 

00:00:14.950 --> 00:00:19.599
 we are all on a tour of these 

00:00:17.619 --> 00:00:21.040
 free range I like me so much and also 

00:00:19.599 --> 00:00:22.360
 it's a game he told me he has 

00:00:21.040 --> 00:00:23.320
 effects therefore I think we're going 

00:00:22.360 --> 00:00:25.450
 to have a great time because I'm passionate 

00:00:23.320 --> 00:00:26.619
 parkour of these that you like and the 

00:00:25.450 --> 00:00:29.020
 truth is that to me this type of parks 

00:00:26.619 --> 00:00:31.029
 Where do you get speed jumps and other 

00:00:29.020 --> 00:00:31.390
 I find very cool maps and good 

00:00:31.029 --> 00:00:33.070
 as well 

00:00:31.390 --> 00:00:35.860
 first of all tell you that I do not know why 

00:00:33.070 --> 00:00:37.840
 today I have recorded a map that was 

00:00:35.860 --> 00:00:39.700
 town of glass that are often seen 

00:00:37.840 --> 00:00:41.320
 Saturday and I do not know when I was going up 

00:00:39.700 --> 00:00:42.700
 this video but let's take all the 

00:00:41.320 --> 00:00:44.530
 afternoon since Friday we also 

00:00:42.700 --> 00:00:46.359
 Friday all weekend has been 

00:00:44.530 --> 00:00:48.160
 that minecraft I do not know why it does not recognize 

00:00:46.359 --> 00:00:49.300
 nor the skins does not matter the times 

00:00:48.160 --> 00:00:51.070
 book your skin that keeps coming out 

00:00:49.300 --> 00:00:54.010
 steve and therefore we are not 

00:00:51.070 --> 00:00:55.539
 signs since we are steve steve steve 

00:00:54.010 --> 00:00:57.249
 version already so it's like that 

00:00:55.539 --> 00:00:58.899
 I hope not that it does not suppose any type 

00:00:57.249 --> 00:01:01.089
 of problem I want to play jack goals 

00:00:58.899 --> 00:01:02.350
 but I can not have to play for steve 

00:01:01.089 --> 00:01:04.269
 that is also very good so sir 

00:01:02.350 --> 00:01:06.460
 steve let's go there let's make a 

00:01:04.269 --> 00:01:07.479
 little bit of parkour very cool and as it comes 

00:01:06.460 --> 00:01:09.250
 I do not know when you are watching this video 

00:01:07.479 --> 00:01:11.200
 because right now it's Saturday I'm alone 

00:01:09.250 --> 00:01:13.300
 and it 's a good time to record because 

00:01:11.200 --> 00:01:14.740
 one with the whole family at home as it is 

00:01:13.300 --> 00:01:16.540
 a little difficult what if one makes noise 

00:01:14.740 --> 00:01:17.800
 that if the other does something else and so 

00:01:16.540 --> 00:01:20.410
 so much so clear 

00:01:17.800 --> 00:01:21.880
 life goes on and you can also when 

00:01:20.410 --> 00:01:23.770
 go now to live with is although good 

00:01:21.880 --> 00:01:25.450
 We already told you in a video so you do not know 

00:01:23.770 --> 00:01:29.220
 it's possible he's going to move in with the lord town 

00:01:25.450 --> 00:01:31.690
 retire you tell me a football and a typical 

00:01:29.220 --> 00:01:33.220
 you wrote these things I like to put 

00:01:31.690 --> 00:01:34.990
 when they counted then it will be 

00:01:33.220 --> 00:01:36.340
 better for me to record because good 

00:01:34.990 --> 00:01:37.570
 I have to have some schedules that in 

00:01:36.340 --> 00:01:39.580
 family goes to bed I can not do it 

00:01:37.570 --> 00:01:40.990
 they exist and at night and others and good 

00:01:39.580 --> 00:01:42.370
 the whole issue of the 

00:01:40.990 --> 00:01:44.440
 channel not because you think that I 

00:01:42.370 --> 00:01:46.060
 class came about nine 

00:01:44.440 --> 00:01:47.710
 night or so of course you're going to make a 

00:01:46.060 --> 00:01:49.000
 livestream and not beat what is already 

00:01:47.710 --> 00:01:50.410
 are people sleeping in your house and not 

00:01:49.000 --> 00:01:51.910
 you can make noise and so on and so 

00:01:50.410 --> 00:01:53.080
 So much when I moved to live alone with him 

00:01:51.910 --> 00:01:54.760
 sir is now part of you visiting 

00:01:53.080 --> 00:01:56.230
 I wrote pasta because I could do more 

00:01:54.760 --> 00:01:58.000
 noise at night to record more things 

00:01:56.230 --> 00:02:00.070
 I will try to do more live streaming and 

00:01:58.000 --> 00:02:01.390
 all that life takes to look at this is 

00:02:00.070 --> 00:02:03.780
 what I say, look at what a pimp 

00:02:01.390 --> 00:02:06.610
