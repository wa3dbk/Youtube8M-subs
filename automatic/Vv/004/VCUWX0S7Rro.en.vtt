00:00:26.750 --> 00:00:26.760 
it is slightly different on Marcy when I

00:00:26.760 --> 00:00:27.740 
it is slightly different on Marcy when I
knew<00:00:26.880> Myles<00:00:27.029> comes<00:00:27.300> in<00:00:27.390> he's<00:00:27.510> going<00:00:27.630> to<00:00:27.689> want

back to do what we've always done with
you<00:03:02.820> get<00:03:02.940> when<00:03:03.360> you<00:03:03.450> can<00:03:03.630> and<00:03:03.840> I<00:03:04.320> think<00:03:04.860> the

00:03:04.970 --> 00:03:04.980 
you get when you can and I think the

00:03:04.980 --> 00:03:06.200 
you get when you can and I think the
biggest<00:03:05.070> change<00:03:05.280> is<00:03:05.550> when<00:03:05.730> we<00:03:05.850> haven't<00:03:06.060> got<00:03:06.180> a

00:03:06.200 --> 00:03:06.210 
biggest change is when we haven't got a

00:03:06.210 --> 00:03:08.330 
biggest change is when we haven't got a
volume<00:03:06.540> on<00:03:06.630> sister<00:03:06.930> when<00:03:07.800> it<00:03:07.890> back<00:03:08.040> as<00:03:08.190> quickly

00:03:08.330 --> 00:03:08.340 
volume on sister when it back as quickly

00:03:08.340 --> 00:03:10.490 
volume on sister when it back as quickly
as<00:03:08.490> possible<00:03:08.880> and<00:03:08.970> being<00:03:09.570> as<00:03:09.810> interns<00:03:10.230> without

00:03:10.490 --> 00:03:10.500 
as possible and being as interns without

00:03:10.500 --> 00:03:11.480 
as possible and being as interns without
the<00:03:10.590> ball<00:03:10.710> as<00:03:10.830> with<00:03:11.010> the<00:03:11.040> wall<00:03:11.250> so<00:03:11.370> I<00:03:11.430> think

00:03:11.480 --> 00:03:11.490 
the ball as with the wall so I think

00:03:11.490 --> 00:03:13.460 
the ball as with the wall so I think
that's<00:03:11.730> the<00:03:11.970> biggest<00:03:12.120> change<00:03:12.360> via<00:03:12.660> under<00:03:12.960> like

00:03:13.460 --> 00:03:13.470 
that's the biggest change via under like

00:03:13.470 --> 00:03:15.050 
that's the biggest change via under like
bone<00:03:13.620> said<00:03:13.860> it's<00:03:14.010> been<00:03:14.100> intense<00:03:14.370> and<00:03:14.670> the

00:03:15.050 --> 00:03:15.060 
bone said it's been intense and the

00:03:15.060 --> 00:03:16.250 
bone said it's been intense and the
heart<00:03:15.240> rates<00:03:15.390> are<00:03:15.480> up<00:03:15.540> there<00:03:15.690> so<00:03:15.840> Ravens<00:03:16.140> game

00:03:16.250 --> 00:03:16.260 
heart rates are up there so Ravens game

00:03:16.260 --> 00:03:17.960 
heart rates are up there so Ravens game

fair for both these are challenging to

00:03:17.970 --> 00:03:19.850 
fair for both these are challenging to

00:03:23.510 --> 00:03:23.520 
not really a big deal we're both who the

00:03:23.520 --> 00:03:25.670 
not really a big deal we're both who the
opposition<00:03:23.790> is<00:03:24.390> really<00:03:24.810> about<00:03:25.020> how<00:03:25.350> you<00:03:25.410> guys
