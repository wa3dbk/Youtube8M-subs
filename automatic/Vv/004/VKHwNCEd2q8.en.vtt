face since I use a sponge I found that

00:03:06.829 --> 00:03:08.860 
face since I use a sponge I found that
my<00:03:06.980> finger<00:03:07.430> work<00:03:07.640> better<00:03:07.970> in<00:03:08.299> blending<00:03:08.780> the

00:03:13.449 --> 00:03:13.459 
of my nose I also added the contour

00:03:13.459 --> 00:03:15.130 
of my nose I also added the contour
underneath<00:03:13.760> my<00:03:14.209> nose<00:03:14.269> to<00:03:14.659> give<00:03:14.810> the<00:03:14.930> illusion

00:03:15.130 --> 00:03:15.140 
underneath my nose to give the illusion

00:03:15.140 --> 00:03:18.339 
underneath my nose to give the illusion
