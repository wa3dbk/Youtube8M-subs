so<00:00:02.440> once<00:00:02.620> this<00:00:02.770> is<00:00:02.920> working<00:00:03.340> smoothly<00:00:03.760> you<00:00:04.000> can

00:00:04.289 --> 00:00:04.299 
so once this is working smoothly you can

00:00:04.299 --> 00:00:05.850 
so once this is working smoothly you can
do<00:00:04.360> it<00:00:04.480> forwards<00:00:04.900> and<00:00:05.020> backwards<00:00:05.230> with<00:00:05.680> either

00:00:05.850 --> 00:00:05.860 
do it forwards and backwards with either

00:00:05.860 --> 00:00:09.090 
do it forwards and backwards with either
set<00:00:06.220> of<00:00:06.370> arms<00:00:07.260> you<00:00:08.260> start<00:00:08.590> to<00:00:08.710> play<00:00:08.890> with<00:00:09.040> the

00:00:09.090 --> 00:00:09.100 
set of arms you start to play with the

00:00:09.100 --> 00:00:11.100 
set of arms you start to play with the
different<00:00:09.190> positions<00:00:09.910> so<00:00:10.269> it's<00:00:10.570> stay<00:00:10.750> back<00:00:10.960> in

00:00:11.100 --> 00:00:11.110 
different positions so it's stay back in

00:00:11.110 --> 00:00:15.299 
different positions so it's stay back in
your<00:00:11.290> set<00:00:11.710> that<00:00:11.889> Vienna<00:00:13.500> for<00:00:14.500> instance<00:00:14.799> I<00:00:15.040> can

00:00:15.299 --> 00:00:15.309 
your set that Vienna for instance I can

00:00:15.309 --> 00:00:18.510 
your set that Vienna for instance I can
face<00:00:15.549> away<00:00:16.000> and<00:00:16.740> suddenly<00:00:17.740> my<00:00:17.950> job<00:00:18.280> gets

00:00:18.510 --> 00:00:18.520 
face away and suddenly my job gets

00:00:18.520 --> 00:00:20.310 
face away and suddenly my job gets
harder<00:00:18.910> because<00:00:19.210> I'm<00:00:19.570> not<00:00:19.810> gonna<00:00:19.960> be<00:00:20.080> doing

00:00:20.310 --> 00:00:20.320 
harder because I'm not gonna be doing

00:00:20.320 --> 00:00:22.950 
harder because I'm not gonna be doing
two<00:00:20.530> beats<00:00:20.770> behind<00:00:21.040> and<00:00:21.430> one<00:00:21.580> in<00:00:21.700> front<00:00:21.960> first

00:00:22.950 --> 00:00:22.960 
two beats behind and one in front first

00:00:22.960 --> 00:00:30.360 
two beats behind and one in front first
I'll<00:00:23.080> just<00:00:23.200> show<00:00:23.610> five<00:00:24.610> six

00:00:30.360 --> 00:00:30.370 

00:00:30.370 --> 00:00:33.030 

so<00:00:30.670> for<00:00:30.820> her<00:00:30.910> it's<00:00:31.090> the<00:00:31.270> same<00:00:31.590> for<00:00:32.590> me<00:00:32.619> and<00:00:32.890> then

00:00:33.030 --> 00:00:33.040 
so for her it's the same for me and then

00:00:33.040 --> 00:00:34.710 
so for her it's the same for me and then
this<00:00:33.190> funny<00:00:33.430> thing<00:00:33.580> rounding<00:00:34.239> two<00:00:34.480> beats

00:00:34.710 --> 00:00:34.720 
this funny thing rounding two beats

00:00:34.720 --> 00:00:37.950 
this funny thing rounding two beats
behind<00:00:35.080> us<00:00:35.530> which<00:00:36.340> there's<00:00:37.090> no<00:00:37.239> pattern<00:00:37.690> I<00:00:37.809> do

00:00:37.950 --> 00:00:37.960 
behind us which there's no pattern I do

00:00:37.960 --> 00:00:39.810 
behind us which there's no pattern I do
with<00:00:38.230> myself<00:00:38.410> like<00:00:38.950> that<00:00:38.980> so<00:00:39.400> it's<00:00:39.550> really<00:00:39.790> a

00:00:39.810 --> 00:00:39.820 
with myself like that so it's really a

00:00:39.820 --> 00:00:42.750 
with myself like that so it's really a
new<00:00:40.059> thing<00:00:40.090> to<00:00:40.630> learn<00:00:40.980> so<00:00:41.980> on<00:00:42.280> the<00:00:42.370> next<00:00:42.610> one

00:00:42.750 --> 00:00:42.760 
new thing to learn so on the next one

00:00:42.760 --> 00:00:46.410 
new thing to learn so on the next one
stay<00:00:42.970> behind<00:00:43.210> you<00:00:44.520> so<00:00:45.520> you<00:00:45.610> can<00:00:45.879> start<00:00:46.210> with

00:00:46.410 --> 00:00:46.420 
stay behind you so you can start with

00:00:46.420 --> 00:00:48.330 
stay behind you so you can start with
initiating<00:00:46.780> just<00:00:47.230> to<00:00:47.440> beat<00:00:47.620> weaves<00:00:47.860> where<00:00:48.280> you

00:00:48.330 --> 00:00:48.340 
initiating just to beat weaves where you

00:00:48.340 --> 00:00:50.280 
initiating just to beat weaves where you
just<00:00:48.460> go<00:00:48.610> over<00:00:48.910> and<00:00:49.270> back<00:00:49.449> or<00:00:49.690> under<00:00:49.930> and<00:00:50.199> back

00:00:50.280 --> 00:00:50.290 
just go over and back or under and back

00:00:50.290 --> 00:00:52.049 
just go over and back or under and back
I<00:00:50.559> go<00:00:50.680> under<00:00:50.890> back<00:00:51.070> she<00:00:51.280> goes<00:00:51.400> over<00:00:51.790> and<00:00:51.910> back

00:00:52.049 --> 00:00:52.059 
I go under back she goes over and back

00:00:52.059 --> 00:00:56.299 
I go under back she goes over and back
just<00:00:52.809> for<00:00:52.989> one<00:00:53.170> beat<00:00:53.379> five<00:00:53.769> six<00:00:54.460> seven<00:00:55.330> eight

00:00:56.299 --> 00:00:56.309 
just for one beat five six seven eight

00:00:56.309 --> 00:01:12.300 
just for one beat five six seven eight
all<00:00:57.309> right<00:00:57.460> we<00:00:57.670> need<00:00:57.790> a<00:00:57.850> few<00:00:58.000> times<00:00:58.239> five<00:00:58.660> six

00:01:12.300 --> 00:01:12.310 

00:01:12.310 --> 00:01:14.370 

/<00:01:12.820> and<00:01:12.939> that's<00:01:13.119> when<00:01:13.299> I<00:01:13.329> come<00:01:13.630> back<00:01:13.899> is<00:01:14.200> when

00:01:14.370 --> 00:01:14.380 
/ and that's when I come back is when

00:01:14.380 --> 00:01:16.969 
/ and that's when I come back is when
technically<00:01:14.890> I<00:01:14.920> would<00:01:15.249> go<00:01:15.429> over<00:01:16.119> again<00:01:16.329> so

00:01:16.969 --> 00:01:16.979 
technically I would go over again so

00:01:16.979 --> 00:01:19.080 
technically I would go over again so
then<00:01:17.979> you<00:01:18.100> can<00:01:18.219> practice<00:01:18.399> where<00:01:18.729> she's<00:01:18.939> gonna

00:01:19.080 --> 00:01:19.090 
then you can practice where she's gonna

00:01:19.090 --> 00:01:22.740 
then you can practice where she's gonna
 under<00:01:19.869> and<00:01:20.200> I'll<00:01:20.289> go<00:01:20.500> over<00:01:20.909> five<00:01:21.909> six

00:01:22.740 --> 00:01:22.750 
 under and I'll go over five six

00:01:22.750 --> 00:01:24.440 
 under and I'll go over five six
seven<00:01:23.710> eight

00:01:24.440 --> 00:01:24.450 
seven eight

00:01:24.450 --> 00:01:31.069 
seven eight
right

00:01:31.069 --> 00:01:31.079 

00:01:31.079 --> 00:01:34.139 

and<00:01:32.079> then<00:01:32.380> I<00:01:32.409> will<00:01:32.799> try<00:01:33.009> to<00:01:33.039> go<00:01:33.250> under<00:01:33.850> and<00:01:33.969> back

00:01:34.139 --> 00:01:34.149 
and then I will try to go under and back

00:01:34.149 --> 00:01:36.840 
and then I will try to go under and back
and<00:01:34.359> over<00:01:34.509> and<00:01:34.750> under<00:01:34.929> and<00:01:34.990> back<00:01:35.200> five<00:01:35.979> six

00:01:36.840 --> 00:01:36.850 
and over and under and back five six

00:01:36.850 --> 00:01:38.459 
and over and under and back five six
seven<00:01:37.840> eight

00:01:38.459 --> 00:01:38.469 
seven eight

00:01:38.469 --> 00:01:52.260 
seven eight
under<00:01:39.189> and<00:01:39.399> back<00:01:39.579> over<00:01:40.390> under<00:01:40.929> back

00:01:52.260 --> 00:01:52.270 

00:01:52.270 --> 00:01:57.899 

if<00:01:52.950> if<00:01:53.950> you<00:01:54.250> know<00:01:54.460> the<00:01:54.700> pattern<00:01:55.920> if<00:01:56.920> say<00:01:57.250> I<00:01:57.280> was

00:01:57.899 --> 00:01:57.909 
if if you know the pattern if say I was

00:01:57.909 --> 00:02:00.270 
if if you know the pattern if say I was
in<00:01:58.090> this<00:01:58.210> position<00:01:58.750> and<00:01:58.990> I'm<00:01:59.140> and<00:01:59.680> say<00:01:59.979> Patti

00:02:00.270 --> 00:02:00.280 
in this position and I'm and say Patti

00:02:00.280 --> 00:02:02.639 
in this position and I'm and say Patti
and<00:02:00.490> is<00:02:00.610> new<00:02:00.759> at<00:02:00.909> it<00:02:00.939> if<00:02:01.540> she<00:02:01.840> spends<00:02:02.140> her<00:02:02.380> left

00:02:02.639 --> 00:02:02.649 
and is new at it if she spends her left

00:02:02.649 --> 00:02:06.000 
and is new at it if she spends her left
point<00:02:02.950> forwards

00:02:06.000 --> 00:02:06.010 

00:02:06.010 --> 00:02:08.490 

another<00:02:06.730> good<00:02:06.910> thing<00:02:06.970> that<00:02:07.150> we<00:02:07.420> can<00:02:07.600> do<00:02:07.750> is<00:02:07.960> you

00:02:08.490 --> 00:02:08.500 
another good thing that we can do is you

00:02:08.500 --> 00:02:11.250 
another good thing that we can do is you
can<00:02:08.650> start<00:02:09.010> if<00:02:09.310> you<00:02:09.580> know<00:02:09.760> it<00:02:09.970> with<00:02:10.330> no<00:02:10.600> poi<00:02:10.900> and

00:02:11.250 --> 00:02:11.260 
can start if you know it with no poi and

00:02:11.260 --> 00:02:13.350 
can start if you know it with no poi and
you<00:02:11.560> get<00:02:11.800> her<00:02:12.040> to<00:02:12.250> tries<00:02:12.520> over<00:02:13.090> and<00:02:13.180> under<00:02:13.300> and

00:02:13.350 --> 00:02:13.360 
you get her to tries over and under and

00:02:13.360 --> 00:02:18.390 
you get her to tries over and under and
back<00:02:13.570> so<00:02:14.530> you<00:02:14.590> go<00:02:14.860> just<00:02:15.750> over<00:02:17.100> and<00:02:18.100> under<00:02:18.250> back

00:02:18.390 --> 00:02:18.400 
back so you go just over and under back

00:02:18.400 --> 00:02:20.820 
back so you go just over and under back
knee<00:02:18.550> over<00:02:19.060> and<00:02:19.570> under<00:02:20.020> and<00:02:20.050> back<00:02:20.530> you<00:02:20.710> just

00:02:20.820 --> 00:02:20.830 
knee over and under and back you just

00:02:20.830 --> 00:02:22.650 
knee over and under and back you just
tell<00:02:21.070> them<00:02:21.220> to<00:02:21.250> beats<00:02:21.700> behind<00:02:21.910> one<00:02:22.270> in<00:02:22.360> front

00:02:22.650 --> 00:02:22.660 
tell them to beats behind one in front

00:02:22.660 --> 00:02:27.060 
tell them to beats behind one in front
two<00:02:23.470> behind<00:02:23.800> one<00:02:24.730> in<00:02:24.880> front<00:02:25.180> two<00:02:25.630> behind<00:02:26.070> one

00:02:27.060 --> 00:02:27.070 
two behind one in front two behind one

00:02:27.070 --> 00:02:28.830 
two behind one in front two behind one
front<00:02:27.340> once<00:02:27.580> they're<00:02:27.850> doing<00:02:28.180> two<00:02:28.390> behind<00:02:28.600> one

00:02:28.830 --> 00:02:28.840 
front once they're doing two behind one

00:02:28.840 --> 00:02:32.280 
front once they're doing two behind one
in<00:02:28.990> front<00:02:29.290> you<00:02:29.800> can<00:02:29.950> let<00:02:30.100> your<00:02:30.220> poi<00:02:30.460> out<00:02:31.290> and

00:02:32.280 --> 00:02:32.290 
in front you can let your poi out and

00:02:32.290 --> 00:02:34.980 
in front you can let your poi out and
then<00:02:33.190> they<00:02:33.370> can<00:02:33.580> see<00:02:33.910> what<00:02:34.120> the<00:02:34.240> pattern<00:02:34.630> looks

00:02:34.980 --> 00:02:34.990 
then they can see what the pattern looks

00:02:34.990 --> 00:02:38.310 
then they can see what the pattern looks
like<00:02:35.770> and<00:02:35.950> feels<00:02:36.250> like<00:02:36.690> so<00:02:37.690> this<00:02:37.810> is<00:02:37.870> a<00:02:38.020> really

00:02:38.310 --> 00:02:38.320 
like and feels like so this is a really

00:02:38.320 --> 00:02:40.710 
like and feels like so this is a really
good<00:02:38.470> initial<00:02:38.890> step<00:02:39.160> so<00:02:39.730> again<00:02:40.000> from<00:02:40.330> scratch

00:02:40.710 --> 00:02:40.720 
good initial step so again from scratch

00:02:40.720 --> 00:02:43.560 
good initial step so again from scratch
you<00:02:41.260> just<00:02:41.530> tell<00:02:41.740> them<00:02:41.910> just<00:02:42.910> spin<00:02:43.270> the<00:02:43.390> poi

00:02:43.560 --> 00:02:43.570 
you just tell them just spin the poi

00:02:43.570 --> 00:02:46.290 
you just tell them just spin the poi
towards<00:02:44.440> the<00:02:44.590> bench<00:02:44.770> then<00:02:45.520> do<00:02:45.700> two<00:02:46.000> beats

00:02:46.290 --> 00:02:46.300 
towards the bench then do two beats

00:02:46.300 --> 00:02:49.980 
towards the bench then do two beats
behind<00:02:46.720> us<00:02:46.870> one<00:02:47.140> in<00:02:47.230> front<00:02:47.610> one<00:02:48.610> two<00:02:49.270> and<00:02:49.570> three

00:02:49.980 --> 00:02:49.990 
behind us one in front one two and three

00:02:49.990 --> 00:02:56.040 
behind us one in front one two and three
one<00:02:50.680> two<00:02:51.400> three<00:02:51.670> one<00:02:52.330> two<00:02:53.290> three<00:02:53.740> one<00:02:54.400> two<00:02:55.330> then

00:02:56.040 --> 00:02:56.050 
one two three one two three one two then

00:02:56.050 --> 00:02:57.870 
one two three one two three one two then
you<00:02:56.170> come<00:02:56.410> in<00:02:56.590> and<00:02:56.890> then<00:02:57.130> they<00:02:57.340> see<00:02:57.400> how<00:02:57.730> it

00:02:57.870 --> 00:02:57.880 
you come in and then they see how it

00:02:57.880 --> 00:03:01.680 
you come in and then they see how it
works<00:02:58.120> this<00:02:58.450> is<00:02:58.630> a<00:02:58.660> really<00:02:58.900> good<00:02:58.990> primer<00:03:00.690> so

00:03:01.680 --> 00:03:01.690 
works this is a really good primer so

00:03:01.690 --> 00:03:03.480 
works this is a really good primer so
then<00:03:01.840> they<00:03:01.960> can<00:03:02.110> look<00:03:02.200> at<00:03:02.320> how<00:03:02.440> it's<00:03:02.650> over<00:03:03.310> and

00:03:03.480 --> 00:03:03.490 
then they can look at how it's over and

00:03:03.490 --> 00:03:06.000 
then they can look at how it's over and
under<00:03:03.940> and<00:03:03.970> back<00:03:04.420> for<00:03:04.720> them<00:03:04.840> over<00:03:05.410> and<00:03:05.590> under

00:03:06.000 --> 00:03:06.010 
under and back for them over and under

00:03:06.010 --> 00:03:08.130 
under and back for them over and under
and<00:03:06.040> back<00:03:06.370> the<00:03:06.580> yellow<00:03:06.790> poi<00:03:07.030> over<00:03:07.630> it<00:03:07.750> under

00:03:08.130 --> 00:03:08.140 
and back the yellow poi over it under

00:03:08.140 --> 00:03:12.710 
and back the yellow poi over it under
and<00:03:08.380> back<00:03:08.640> over<00:03:09.640> under<00:03:10.240> back<00:03:10.680> over<00:03:11.680> under<00:03:12.190> back

00:03:12.710 --> 00:03:12.720 
and back over under back over under back

00:03:12.720 --> 00:03:15.570 
and back over under back over under back
so<00:03:13.720> if<00:03:13.930> I'm<00:03:14.230> initiating<00:03:14.560> it's<00:03:15.040> pretty<00:03:15.310> easy

00:03:15.570 --> 00:03:15.580 
so if I'm initiating it's pretty easy

00:03:15.580 --> 00:03:17.610 
so if I'm initiating it's pretty easy
because<00:03:15.940> she<00:03:16.150> can<00:03:16.300> go<00:03:16.420> straight<00:03:16.750> into<00:03:16.900> over

00:03:17.610 --> 00:03:17.620 
because she can go straight into over

00:03:17.620 --> 00:03:20.940 
because she can go straight into over
and<00:03:17.800> under<00:03:18.190> and<00:03:18.400> back<00:03:18.580> so<00:03:18.970> I<00:03:19.000> can<00:03:19.209> say<00:03:19.390> one<00:03:20.260> two

00:03:20.940 --> 00:03:20.950 
and under and back so I can say one two

00:03:20.950 --> 00:03:24.120 
and under and back so I can say one two
three<00:03:21.700> over<00:03:22.600> and<00:03:22.780> under<00:03:23.200> and<00:03:23.230> back<00:03:23.680> to<00:03:23.950> that's

00:03:24.120 --> 00:03:24.130 
three over and under and back to that's

00:03:24.130 --> 00:03:27.330 
three over and under and back to that's
the<00:03:24.280> easiest<00:03:24.730> for<00:03:25.150> her

00:03:27.330 --> 00:03:27.340 

00:03:27.340 --> 00:03:30.480 

and<00:03:27.790> the<00:03:27.880> next<00:03:28.060> one<00:03:28.240> stay<00:03:28.480> in<00:03:28.690> front

00:03:30.480 --> 00:03:30.490 
and the next one stay in front

00:03:30.490 --> 00:03:32.460 
and the next one stay in front
it's<00:03:31.060> a<00:03:31.150> little<00:03:31.420> harder<00:03:31.720> if<00:03:31.780> she<00:03:32.020> initiates

00:03:32.460 --> 00:03:32.470 
it's a little harder if she initiates

00:03:32.470 --> 00:03:34.230 
it's a little harder if she initiates
but<00:03:32.770> it<00:03:32.920> comes<00:03:33.310> with<00:03:33.460> a<00:03:33.520> little<00:03:33.640> practice<00:03:33.850> for

00:03:34.230 --> 00:03:34.240 
but it comes with a little practice for

00:03:34.240 --> 00:03:36.060 
but it comes with a little practice for
she<00:03:34.360> has<00:03:34.450> to<00:03:34.570> go<00:03:34.690> under<00:03:35.110> and<00:03:35.380> then<00:03:35.770> over<00:03:35.800> and

00:03:36.060 --> 00:03:36.070 
she has to go under and then over and

00:03:36.070 --> 00:03:42.710 
she has to go under and then over and
under<00:03:36.250> in<00:03:36.310> match<00:03:37.560> five<00:03:38.560> six<00:03:39.280> seven<00:03:40.210> eight

00:03:42.710 --> 00:03:42.720 

00:03:42.720 --> 00:03:49.089 

yep

00:03:49.089 --> 00:03:49.099 

00:03:49.099 --> 00:03:51.910 

so<00:03:50.090> backwards<00:03:50.989> everything's<00:03:51.469> a<00:03:51.739> little

00:03:51.910 --> 00:03:51.920 
so backwards everything's a little

00:03:51.920 --> 00:03:54.220 
so backwards everything's a little
different<00:03:52.459> again<00:03:52.879> if<00:03:53.329> I<00:03:53.569> know<00:03:53.689> how<00:03:53.900> to<00:03:53.959> do<00:03:54.139> it

00:03:54.220 --> 00:03:54.230 
different again if I know how to do it

00:03:54.230 --> 00:03:55.959 
different again if I know how to do it
and<00:03:54.349> I'm<00:03:54.409> showing<00:03:54.590> her<00:03:54.859> I<00:03:54.889> get<00:03:55.489> her<00:03:55.609> to<00:03:55.730> start

00:03:55.959 --> 00:03:55.969 
and I'm showing her I get her to start

00:03:55.969 --> 00:03:59.379 
and I'm showing her I get her to start
doing<00:03:56.120> two<00:03:56.359> behind<00:03:56.599> one<00:03:56.840> in<00:03:56.930> front<00:03:57.730> one<00:03:58.730> two

00:03:59.379 --> 00:03:59.389 
doing two behind one in front one two

00:03:59.389 --> 00:04:05.229 
doing two behind one in front one two
three<00:04:00.109> one<00:04:00.769> two<00:04:01.310> three<00:04:03.549> and<00:04:04.549> I<00:04:04.730> find<00:04:05.030> how<00:04:05.180> to

00:04:05.229 --> 00:04:05.239 
three one two three and I find how to

00:04:05.239 --> 00:04:07.839 
three one two three and I find how to
come<00:04:05.480> in<00:04:05.840> and<00:04:06.230> then<00:04:06.680> she<00:04:07.099> just<00:04:07.280> looks<00:04:07.519> at<00:04:07.700> it

00:04:07.839 --> 00:04:07.849 
come in and then she just looks at it

00:04:07.849 --> 00:04:09.220 
come in and then she just looks at it
and<00:04:07.909> gets<00:04:08.060> used<00:04:08.269> to<00:04:08.420> what<00:04:08.510> the<00:04:08.599> pattern<00:04:08.930> looks

00:04:09.220 --> 00:04:09.230 
and gets used to what the pattern looks

00:04:09.230 --> 00:04:14.020 
and gets used to what the pattern looks
like<00:04:09.889> and<00:04:10.219> feels<00:04:10.250> like

00:04:14.020 --> 00:04:14.030 

00:04:14.030 --> 00:04:17.600 

under<00:04:15.030> and<00:04:15.210> over<00:04:15.420> and<00:04:15.930> back<00:04:15.990> under<00:04:16.830> and<00:04:17.370> over

00:04:17.600 --> 00:04:17.610 
under and over and back under and over

00:04:17.610 --> 00:04:21.380 
under and over and back under and over
and<00:04:17.880> back<00:04:18.209> under<00:04:18.989> and<00:04:19.260> over<00:04:19.560> and<00:04:19.800> under<00:04:20.390> and

00:04:21.380 --> 00:04:21.390 
and back under and over and under and

00:04:21.390 --> 00:04:27.420 
and back under and over and under and
over<00:04:21.630> and<00:04:22.080> back<00:04:22.110> annex<00:04:22.560> one<00:04:22.800> stay<00:04:23.010> in<00:04:23.070> front

00:04:27.420 --> 00:04:27.430 

00:04:27.430 --> 00:04:29.400 

and<00:04:27.850> so<00:04:28.090> if<00:04:28.210> I'm<00:04:28.419> initiating<00:04:29.050> it's<00:04:29.199> pretty

00:04:29.400 --> 00:04:29.410 
and so if I'm initiating it's pretty

00:04:29.410 --> 00:04:31.320 
and so if I'm initiating it's pretty
easy<00:04:29.830> sheis<00:04:30.460> has<00:04:30.610> to<00:04:30.729> go<00:04:30.820> back<00:04:31.030> into<00:04:31.240> that

00:04:31.320 --> 00:04:31.330 
easy sheis has to go back into that

00:04:31.330 --> 00:04:34.469 
easy sheis has to go back into that
pattern<00:04:31.660> of<00:04:32.310> under<00:04:33.310> and<00:04:33.430> over<00:04:33.550> and<00:04:33.699> back<00:04:33.970> five

00:04:34.469 --> 00:04:34.479 
pattern of under and over and back five

00:04:34.479 --> 00:04:40.499 
pattern of under and over and back five
six<00:04:35.229> seven<00:04:36.100> eight<00:04:37.710> over<00:04:38.710> in<00:04:38.919> fact<00:04:39.479> what<00:04:40.479> you

00:04:40.499 --> 00:04:40.509 
six seven eight over in fact what you

00:04:40.509 --> 00:04:42.120 
six seven eight over in fact what you
can<00:04:40.660> all<00:04:40.870> just<00:04:41.050> think<00:04:41.259> it's<00:04:41.380> just<00:04:41.500> two<00:04:41.710> behind

00:04:42.120 --> 00:04:42.130 
can all just think it's just two behind

00:04:42.130 --> 00:04:47.219 
can all just think it's just two behind
us<00:04:42.870> so<00:04:43.870> if<00:04:43.960> I'm<00:04:44.110> initiating<00:04:44.850> not<00:04:45.850> so<00:04:46.060> tough<00:04:46.240> it

00:04:47.219 --> 00:04:47.229 
us so if I'm initiating not so tough it

00:04:47.229 --> 00:04:49.230 
us so if I'm initiating not so tough it
takes<00:04:47.740> a<00:04:47.830> little<00:04:48.070> it<00:04:48.280> takes<00:04:48.370> a<00:04:48.520> few<00:04:48.729> more<00:04:48.880> tries

00:04:49.230 --> 00:04:49.240 
takes a little it takes a few more tries

00:04:49.240 --> 00:04:51.150 
takes a little it takes a few more tries
to<00:04:49.690> be<00:04:49.810> the<00:04:49.840> initiator<00:04:50.289> if<00:04:50.650> you're<00:04:50.800> in<00:04:50.889> front

00:04:51.150 --> 00:04:51.160 
to be the initiator if you're in front

00:04:51.160 --> 00:04:54.080 
to be the initiator if you're in front
so<00:04:51.850> on<00:04:52.030> the<00:04:52.120> next<00:04:52.210> one<00:04:52.479> stay<00:04:52.720> in<00:04:52.780> front

00:04:54.080 --> 00:04:54.090 
so on the next one stay in front

00:04:54.090 --> 00:04:56.820 
so on the next one stay in front
so<00:04:55.090> she's<00:04:55.389> initiating<00:04:56.110> she<00:04:56.259> has<00:04:56.380> to<00:04:56.530> do<00:04:56.620> just

00:04:56.820 --> 00:04:56.830 
so she's initiating she has to do just

00:04:56.830 --> 00:04:59.090 
so she's initiating she has to do just
one<00:04:57.070> over<00:04:57.490> and<00:04:57.759> then<00:04:57.850> she<00:04:57.970> goes<00:04:58.090> back<00:04:58.120> to<00:04:58.479> front

00:04:59.090 --> 00:04:59.100 
one over and then she goes back to front

the<00:05:16.029> final<00:05:16.419> position<00:05:16.659> is<00:05:17.139> back-to-back

00:05:21.220 --> 00:05:21.230 

00:05:21.230 --> 00:05:24.430 

where<00:05:21.920> we<00:05:22.370> both<00:05:22.670> got<00:05:22.970> the<00:05:23.000> hard<00:05:23.360> part<00:05:23.660> which<00:05:24.260> it

00:05:24.430 --> 00:05:24.440 
where we both got the hard part which it

00:05:24.440 --> 00:05:26.050 
where we both got the hard part which it
won't<00:05:24.590> be<00:05:24.740> hard<00:05:24.950> for<00:05:25.160> long<00:05:25.340> it<00:05:25.520> gets<00:05:25.610> easy

00:05:26.050 --> 00:05:26.060 
won't be hard for long it gets easy

00:05:26.060 --> 00:05:32.200 
won't be hard for long it gets easy
pretty<00:05:26.330> quick<00:05:26.540> five<00:05:27.080> six<00:05:27.770> seven<00:05:28.700> eight

00:05:32.200 --> 00:05:32.210 

00:05:32.210 --> 00:05:34.779 

and<00:05:32.600> they<00:05:32.750> were<00:05:32.810> back<00:05:32.990> to<00:05:33.169> back<00:05:33.199> I<00:05:33.699> mean<00:05:34.699> the

00:05:34.779 --> 00:05:34.789 
and they were back to back I mean the

00:05:34.789 --> 00:05:35.980 
and they were back to back I mean the
first<00:05:34.970> few<00:05:35.240> times<00:05:35.360> it<00:05:35.539> might<00:05:35.690> seem<00:05:35.870> strange

00:05:35.980 --> 00:05:35.990 
first few times it might seem strange

00:05:35.990 --> 00:05:38.620 
first few times it might seem strange
but<00:05:36.380> it<00:05:36.650> it'll<00:05:37.460> you'll<00:05:37.820> slip<00:05:38.000> into<00:05:38.210> it<00:05:38.330> before

00:05:38.620 --> 00:05:38.630 
but it it'll you'll slip into it before

00:05:38.630 --> 00:05:41.020 
but it it'll you'll slip into it before
too<00:05:38.780> long<00:05:39.160> especially<00:05:40.160> if<00:05:40.610> you<00:05:40.699> have<00:05:40.820> a<00:05:40.880> few

00:05:41.020 --> 00:05:41.030 
too long especially if you have a few

00:05:41.030 --> 00:05:42.340 
too long especially if you have a few
friends<00:05:41.270> and<00:05:41.479> you're<00:05:41.660> out<00:05:41.780> triple<00:05:42.199> shooting

so all these these different positions

00:05:50.530 --> 00:05:52.740 
so all these these different positions
make<00:05:50.800> a<00:05:50.830> lot<00:05:51.130> of<00:05:51.250> stuff<00:05:51.520> possible<00:05:51.940> later<00:05:52.420> on
