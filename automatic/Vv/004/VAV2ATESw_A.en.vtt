was<00:00:34.110> because<00:00:34.350> of<00:00:34.469> legal<00:00:34.620> discussions<00:00:37.940> yeah

00:00:38.930 --> 00:00:38.940 
was because of legal discussions yeah

00:00:38.940 --> 00:00:43.430 
was because of legal discussions yeah
and<00:00:39.469> so<00:00:40.469> just<00:00:40.920> to<00:00:41.100> clarify<00:00:41.399> this<00:00:42.090> could<00:00:42.840> be<00:00:43.410> a

00:00:43.430 --> 00:00:43.440 
and so just to clarify this could be a

00:00:43.440 --> 00:00:46.279 
and so just to clarify this could be a
hack<00:00:43.800> like<00:00:44.399> there<00:00:44.760> has<00:00:44.879> been<00:00:45.059> in<00:00:45.149> the<00:00:45.210> past<00:00:45.510> it

00:00:46.279 --> 00:00:46.289 
hack like there has been in the past it

00:00:46.289 --> 00:00:49.130 
hack like there has been in the past it
could<00:00:46.890> be<00:00:47.160> but<00:00:47.820> to<00:00:48.210> be<00:00:48.360> honest<00:00:48.660> because<00:00:48.809> it

00:00:49.130 --> 00:00:49.140 
could be but to be honest because it

00:00:49.140 --> 00:00:52.279 
could be but to be honest because it
looks<00:00:49.320> so<00:00:49.530> professional<00:00:49.739> and<00:00:50.460> if<00:00:51.449> you<00:00:52.020> were<00:00:52.140> to

00:00:52.279 --> 00:00:52.289 
looks so professional and if you were to

00:00:52.289 --> 00:00:53.420 
looks so professional and if you were to
hack<00:00:52.440> it<00:00:52.620> you<00:00:52.710> could<00:00:52.860> do<00:00:52.980> lots<00:00:53.219> of<00:00:53.340> other

00:00:53.420 --> 00:00:53.430 
hack it you could do lots of other

00:00:53.430 --> 00:00:54.740 
hack it you could do lots of other
things<00:00:53.789> that<00:00:53.940> I<00:00:54.059> doubt<00:00:54.300> they'd<00:00:54.480> do<00:00:54.600> their

00:00:54.740 --> 00:00:54.750

slightly confusing to me because surely

00:01:24.900 --> 00:01:26.539 
slightly confusing to me because surely
even<00:01:25.320> if<00:01:25.409> his<00:01:25.500> legal<00:01:25.799> discussions<00:01:26.189> he<00:01:26.340> comes

00:01:26.539 --> 00:01:26.549 
even if his legal discussions he comes

00:01:26.549 --> 00:01:28.700 
even if his legal discussions he comes
he<00:01:26.820> can<00:01:26.939> still<00:01:27.150> say<00:01:27.420> like<00:01:27.810> I'm<00:01:28.110> in<00:01:28.350> your

he can still say like I'm in your
discussions<00:01:45.380> and<00:01:46.610> was<00:01:47.780> how<00:01:48.780> long<00:01:48.930> ago

00:01:49.100 --> 00:01:49.110 
discussions and was how long ago

00:01:49.110 --> 00:01:53.749 
discussions and was how long ago
submitted<00:01:50.899> yeah<00:01:51.899> that's<00:01:52.170> it<00:01:52.680> I<00:01:53.070> don't<00:01:53.640> know

00:01:53.749 --> 00:01:53.759 
submitted yeah that's it I don't know

00:01:53.759 --> 00:01:56.270 
submitted yeah that's it I don't know
because<00:01:54.060> like<00:01:54.299> I<00:01:54.450> presume<00:01:54.960> Mont<00:01:55.829> would<00:01:56.040> never

00:01:56.270 --> 00:01:56.280 
because like I presume Mont would never

00:01:56.280 --> 00:01:59.539 
because like I presume Mont would never
even<00:01:56.369> serve<00:01:56.670> at<00:01:56.790> a<00:01:56.820> jack<00:01:57.950> so<00:01:58.950> we<00:01:59.100> have<00:01:59.280> to

00:01:59.539 --> 00:01:59.549 
even serve at a jack so we have to

00:01:59.549 --> 00:02:01.389 
even serve at a jack so we have to
presume<00:02:00.060> that<00:02:00.119> he<00:02:00.390> kept<00:02:00.630> messages<00:02:00.990> to<00:02:01.170> himself

00:02:01.389 --> 00:02:01.399 
presume that he kept messages to himself

00:02:01.399 --> 00:02:05.270 
presume that he kept messages to himself
so<00:02:02.399> this<00:02:02.490> is<00:02:02.670> pretty<00:02:02.939> big<00:02:03.149> news<00:02:03.829> and<00:02:04.829> then<00:02:05.100> he

00:02:05.270 --> 00:02:05.280 
so this is pretty big news and then he

00:02:05.280 --> 00:02:07.370 
so this is pretty big news and then he
just<00:02:05.430> says<00:02:05.640> at<00:02:05.909> the<00:02:06.000> end<00:02:06.119> how<00:02:06.390> he<00:02:06.450> he<00:02:06.990> thanks
