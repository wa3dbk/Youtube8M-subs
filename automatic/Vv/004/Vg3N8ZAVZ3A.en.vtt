sand<00:02:47.260> storm<00:02:47.680> sand<00:02:48.489> storms<00:02:49.480> and<00:02:49.810> I'm<00:02:50.680> actually

00:02:50.789 --> 00:02:50.799 
sand storm sand storms and I'm actually

00:02:50.799 --> 00:02:52.890 
sand storm sand storms and I'm actually
surprised<00:02:51.280> I<00:02:51.459> had<00:02:51.579> enough<00:02:51.849> tan<00:02:52.150> bricks<00:02:52.420> to<00:02:52.720> do

00:02:52.890 --> 00:02:52.900 
surprised I had enough tan bricks to do

00:02:52.900 --> 00:02:55.500 
surprised I had enough tan bricks to do
this<00:02:53.110> I<00:02:53.349> only<00:02:54.310> had<00:02:54.549> one<00:02:54.579> way<00:02:55.000> of<00:02:55.120> doing<00:02:55.360> it<00:02:55.480> that

00:02:55.500 --> 00:02:55.510 
this I only had one way of doing it that

00:02:55.510 --> 00:02:59.009 
this I only had one way of doing it that
was<00:02:55.750> filling<00:02:56.140> in<00:02:57.030> random<00:02:58.030> colors<00:02:58.360> underneath

00:02:59.009 --> 00:02:59.019 
was filling in random colors underneath

00:02:59.019 --> 00:03:01.440 
was filling in random colors underneath
of<00:02:59.349> this<00:02:59.530> but<00:02:59.829> you<00:02:59.950> can't<00:03:00.190> see<00:03:00.370> that<00:03:00.549> you'd

00:03:01.440 --> 00:03:01.450 
of this but you can't see that you'd

00:03:01.450 --> 00:03:03.120 
of this but you can't see that you'd
only<00:03:01.599> see<00:03:01.870> it<00:03:01.989> right<00:03:02.200> there<00:03:02.230> cuz<00:03:02.590> I<00:03:02.680> ran<00:03:02.860> out<00:03:03.010> of

00:03:03.120 --> 00:03:03.130 
only see it right there cuz I ran out of

00:03:03.130 --> 00:03:03.479 
only see it right there cuz I ran out of
bricks

00:03:03.479 --> 00:03:03.489 
bricks

00:03:03.489 --> 00:03:07.199 
bricks
but<00:03:04.060> yeah<00:03:05.040> so<00:03:06.040> here<00:03:06.190> it<00:03:06.280> is<00:03:06.400> it's<00:03:06.640> very<00:03:06.700> small

00:03:07.199 --> 00:03:07.209 
but yeah so here it is it's very small

00:03:07.209 --> 00:03:09.630 
but yeah so here it is it's very small
inside<00:03:07.720> as<00:03:07.959> you<00:03:08.079> can<00:03:08.110> see<00:03:08.500> just<00:03:09.220> to<00:03:09.340> get<00:03:09.489> that

00:03:09.630 --> 00:03:09.640 
inside as you can see just to get that

00:03:09.640 --> 00:03:12.150 
inside as you can see just to get that
hillside<00:03:09.970> I<00:03:10.840> was<00:03:11.170> planning<00:03:11.560> on<00:03:11.620> it<00:03:11.680> being<00:03:11.890> much

00:03:12.150 --> 00:03:12.160 
hillside I was planning on it being much

00:03:12.160 --> 00:03:15.300 
hillside I was planning on it being much
bigger<00:03:12.430> but<00:03:13.209> to<00:03:13.329> get<00:03:13.450> this<00:03:13.630> hill<00:03:13.930> style<00:03:14.769> but

00:03:15.300 --> 00:03:15.310 
bigger but to get this hill style but

00:03:15.310 --> 00:03:16.380 
bigger but to get this hill style but
still<00:03:15.340> have<00:03:15.670> it<00:03:15.700> tall<00:03:15.970> enough<00:03:16.209> for

00:03:16.380 --> 00:03:16.390 
still have it tall enough for

00:03:16.390 --> 00:03:18.720 
still have it tall enough for
minifigures<00:03:16.630> oh<00:03:17.200> this<00:03:17.950> is<00:03:18.069> how<00:03:18.220> I<00:03:18.250> had<00:03:18.459> to<00:03:18.579> do

00:03:18.720 --> 00:03:18.730 
minifigures oh this is how I had to do

00:03:18.730 --> 00:03:21.240 
minifigures oh this is how I had to do
it<00:03:18.880> what's<00:03:19.120> a<00:03:19.209> 32<00:03:19.660> by<00:03:19.780> 32<00:03:20.139> basically<00:03:20.620> believe

00:03:21.240 --> 00:03:21.250 
it what's a 32 by 32 basically believe

00:03:21.250 --> 00:03:25.259 
it what's a 32 by 32 basically believe
this<00:03:21.400> what<00:03:21.609> this<00:03:21.819> is<00:03:22.440> not<00:03:23.440> 100%<00:03:24.190> sure<00:03:24.609> but<00:03:24.880> yeah

00:03:25.259 --> 00:03:25.269 
this what this is not 100% sure but yeah

00:03:25.269 --> 00:03:29.370 
this what this is not 100% sure but yeah
so<00:03:26.260> we<00:03:26.350> just<00:03:26.380> have<00:03:26.620> a<00:03:26.680> shadow<00:03:26.980> trooper<00:03:28.380> it's

00:03:29.370 --> 00:03:29.380 
so we just have a shadow trooper it's

00:03:29.380 --> 00:03:30.569 
so we just have a shadow trooper it's
kind<00:03:29.560> of<00:03:29.620> perfect<00:03:29.829> to<00:03:30.190> look<00:03:30.310> out<00:03:30.459> a<00:03:30.489> window

00:03:30.569 --> 00:03:30.579 
kind of perfect to look out a window

00:03:30.579 --> 00:03:32.370 
kind of perfect to look out a window
because<00:03:31.239> you<00:03:31.329> can't<00:03:31.510> really<00:03:31.660> see<00:03:31.930> him<00:03:32.049> like<00:03:32.350> a

00:03:32.370 --> 00:03:32.380 
because you can't really see him like a

00:03:32.380 --> 00:03:36.270 
because you can't really see him like a
white<00:03:32.680> random<00:03:33.459> white<00:03:33.730> guy<00:03:34.620> white<00:03:35.620> guy<00:03:35.650> has<00:03:36.040> in

00:03:36.270 --> 00:03:36.280 
white random white guy white guy has in

00:03:36.280 --> 00:03:39.080 
white random white guy white guy has in
not<00:03:36.519> to<00:03:36.639> be<00:03:36.760> racist<00:03:36.940> or<00:03:37.389> anything<00:03:37.450> I<00:03:37.989> mean<00:03:38.350> as

00:03:39.080 --> 00:03:39.090 
not to be racist or anything I mean as

00:03:39.090 --> 00:03:42.030 
not to be racist or anything I mean as
in<00:03:40.090> stormtroopers<00:03:40.810> kind<00:03:41.380> of<00:03:41.470> obvious<00:03:41.859> but

00:03:42.030 --> 00:03:42.040 
in stormtroopers kind of obvious but

00:03:42.040 --> 00:03:43.319 
in stormtroopers kind of obvious but
shadow<00:03:42.340> should<00:03:42.609> be<00:03:42.760> you<00:03:42.850> know<00:03:43.000> you<00:03:43.060> can't

00:03:43.319 --> 00:03:43.329 
shadow should be you know you can't

00:03:43.329 --> 00:03:45.360 
shadow should be you know you can't
really<00:03:43.480> see<00:03:43.660> it<00:03:43.720> from<00:03:43.840> far<00:03:43.959> away<00:03:44.250> so<00:03:45.250> you're

00:03:45.360 --> 00:03:45.370 
really see it from far away so you're

00:03:45.370 --> 00:03:48.479 
really see it from far away so you're
just<00:03:45.489> kind<00:03:45.639> of<00:03:45.730> standing<00:03:46.150> guard<00:03:46.359> I<00:03:46.780> guess<00:03:47.489> he's

00:03:48.479 --> 00:03:48.489 
just kind of standing guard I guess he's

00:03:48.489 --> 00:03:50.340 
just kind of standing guard I guess he's
just<00:03:48.519> doing<00:03:48.880> whatever<00:03:49.150> cuz<00:03:49.569> it's<00:03:49.750> not<00:03:49.900> on<00:03:50.230> the

00:03:50.340 --> 00:03:50.350 
just doing whatever cuz it's not on the

00:03:50.350 --> 00:03:53.550 
just doing whatever cuz it's not on the
guard<00:03:50.530> duty<00:03:51.540> you<00:03:52.540> can<00:03:52.690> see<00:03:52.900> not<00:03:53.109> many<00:03:53.319> troops

00:03:53.550 --> 00:03:53.560 
guard duty you can see not many troops

00:03:53.560 --> 00:03:55.620 
guard duty you can see not many troops
are<00:03:53.769> here<00:03:53.950> because<00:03:54.220> it's<00:03:54.549> not<00:03:54.700> that<00:03:54.940> important

00:03:55.620 --> 00:03:55.630 
are here because it's not that important
