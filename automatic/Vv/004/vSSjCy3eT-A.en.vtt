quite<00:00:55.440> tight<00:00:55.739> I<00:00:56.070> think<00:00:56.910> Google<00:00:57.180> probably

00:00:57.500 --> 00:00:57.510 
quite tight I think Google probably

00:00:57.510 --> 00:00:58.880 
quite tight I think Google probably
wanted<00:00:57.780> to<00:00:57.809> make<00:00:57.989> sure<00:00:58.020> everything<00:00:58.199> stayed

00:00:58.880 --> 00:00:58.890 
wanted to make sure everything stayed

00:00:58.890 --> 00:01:00.650 
wanted to make sure everything stayed
together<00:00:59.129> in<00:00:59.460> one<00:00:59.609> piece<00:00:59.879> and<00:01:00.120> reach<00:01:00.449> the

00:01:00.650 --> 00:01:00.660 
together in one piece and reach the

00:01:00.660 --> 00:01:03.200 
together in one piece and reach the
person<00:01:00.930> who<00:01:01.020> bought<00:01:01.170> it<00:01:01.370> so<00:01:02.370> that's<00:01:03.090> the

00:01:03.200 --> 00:01:03.210 
person who bought it so that's the

00:01:03.210 --> 00:01:05.570 
person who bought it so that's the
sleeve<00:01:03.510> off<00:01:03.690> and<00:01:03.960> you<00:01:04.500> get<00:01:04.680> this<00:01:04.860> black<00:01:05.280> box

00:01:05.570 --> 00:01:05.580 
sleeve off and you get this black box

00:01:05.580 --> 00:01:08.390

00:01:17.749 --> 00:01:17.759 
tape on both sides that just needs to be

00:01:17.759 --> 00:01:20.990 
tape on both sides that just needs to be
cut<00:01:17.939> open<00:01:18.770> the<00:01:19.770> box<00:01:20.009> is<00:01:20.220> a<00:01:20.250> little<00:01:20.549> fiddly<00:01:20.850> to

00:01:20.990 --> 00:01:21.000 
cut open the box is a little fiddly to

00:01:21.000 --> 00:01:22.880 
cut open the box is a little fiddly to
open<00:01:21.420> trying<00:01:21.780> to<00:01:21.900> pull<00:01:22.049> it<00:01:22.140> open<00:01:22.259> doesn't<00:01:22.710> work

00:01:22.880 --> 00:01:22.890 
open trying to pull it open doesn't work

00:01:22.890 --> 00:01:24.950 
open trying to pull it open doesn't work
so<00:01:23.340> placing<00:01:23.820> it<00:01:23.909> on<00:01:24.000> the<00:01:24.030> table<00:01:24.270> and<00:01:24.509> wiggling

so placing it on the table and wiggling
the<00:01:25.080> top<00:01:25.259> loose<00:01:25.470> does<00:01:25.770> the<00:01:25.920> trick<00:01:26.130> and<00:01:26.400> there

00:01:26.899 --> 00:01:26.909 
the top loose does the trick and there

00:01:26.909 --> 00:01:29.870
