00:01:49.920 --> 00:01:52.399 
started getting like it was too thick so
I<00:01:50.130> added<00:01:50.310> just<00:01:50.460> a<00:01:50.700> tad<00:01:50.970> bit<00:01:51.180> more<00:01:51.210> water<00:01:51.689> so<00:01:52.320> you

00:01:52.399 --> 00:01:52.409 
I added just a tad bit more water so you

00:01:52.409 --> 00:01:53.660 
I added just a tad bit more water so you
kind<00:01:52.619> of<00:01:52.649> have<00:01:52.770> to<00:01:52.829> eyeball<00:01:53.250> it<00:01:53.460> and<00:01:53.549> then

00:01:53.660 --> 00:01:53.670 
kind of have to eyeball it and then

00:01:53.670 --> 00:01:55.730 
kind of have to eyeball it and then
you're<00:01:53.820> left<00:01:54.030> with<00:01:54.210> another<00:01:54.509> smooth<00:01:55.290> finish

00:01:55.730 --> 00:01:55.740 
you're left with another smooth finish

00:01:55.740 --> 00:01:59.090 
you're left with another smooth finish
of<00:01:55.979> a<00:01:56.130> consistency<00:01:56.790> for<00:01:57.750> this<00:01:57.930> one<00:01:58.229> and<00:01:58.469> I<00:01:59.040> just

00:01:59.090 --> 00:01:59.100 
of a consistency for this one and I just

00:01:59.100 --> 00:02:01.069 
of a consistency for this one and I just
applied<00:01:59.759> that<00:01:59.939> all<00:02:00.119> over<00:02:00.360> my<00:02:00.509> face<00:02:00.719> with<00:02:00.750> that

elf<00:02:01.290> brush<00:02:01.590> again<00:02:01.920> and<00:02:03.110> I<00:02:04.110> put<00:02:04.320> it<00:02:04.409> on<00:02:04.560> every

00:02:05.240 --> 00:02:05.250 
elf brush again and I put it on every

00:02:05.250 --> 00:02:07.459 
elf brush again and I put it on every
nook<00:02:05.430> and<00:02:05.700> cranny<00:02:05.969> of<00:02:06.090> my<00:02:06.390> face<00:02:06.689> including<00:02:07.290> my

00:02:07.469 --> 00:02:11.210 
nook and cranny of my face including my
chin<00:02:07.860> and<00:02:08.989> this<00:02:09.989> one<00:02:10.200> starts<00:02:10.410> drying<00:02:10.920> on<00:02:11.190> your

00:02:11.210 --> 00:02:11.220

00:02:11.220 --> 00:02:13.640 
chin and this one starts drying on your
face<00:02:11.840> faster<00:02:12.840> than<00:02:13.080> the<00:02:13.230> other<00:02:13.379> one

00:02:13.640 --> 00:02:13.650 
face faster than the other one

00:02:13.650 --> 00:02:16.220 
face faster than the other one
so<00:02:13.769> apply<00:02:14.040> this<00:02:14.250> one<00:02:14.599> faster<00:02:15.599> and<00:02:15.870> this<00:02:16.019> one's

00:02:16.230 --> 00:02:18.530 
so apply this one faster and this one's
also<00:02:16.650> for<00:02:16.860> a<00:02:16.890> one<00:02:17.159> time<00:02:17.400> serving<00:02:17.909> and<00:02:18.090> I'm

00:02:18.530 --> 00:02:18.540 
also for a one time serving and I'm

00:02:18.540 --> 00:02:20.420 
also for a one time serving and I'm
making<00:02:18.780> these<00:02:19.110> silly<00:02:19.409> faces<00:02:19.709> now<00:02:20.040> because

00:02:20.420 --> 00:02:20.430 
making these silly faces now because

00:02:20.430 --> 00:02:22.580 
making these silly faces now because
this<00:02:20.610> is<00:02:20.670> the<00:02:20.819> mask<00:02:21.150> that<00:02:21.450> like<00:02:21.659> cracks<00:02:22.319> and

00:02:22.580 --> 00:02:22.590 
this is the mask that like cracks and

00:02:22.590 --> 00:02:24.679 
this is the mask that like cracks and
you<00:02:22.680> can't<00:02:22.950> move<00:02:23.280> your<00:02:23.519> face<00:02:23.760> at<00:02:24.090> all<00:02:24.150> so<00:02:24.599> I'm

00:02:24.679 --> 00:02:24.689 
you can't move your face at all so I'm

00:02:24.689 --> 00:02:26.630 
you can't move your face at all so I'm
making<00:02:25.019> all<00:02:25.170> these<00:02:25.349> silly<00:02:25.560> faces<00:02:25.860> in<00:02:26.370> the

00:02:26.630 --> 00:02:26.640 
making all these silly faces in the

00:02:26.640 --> 00:02:29.360 
making all these silly faces in the
beginning<00:02:27.120> and<00:02:27.329> then<00:02:28.260> I<00:02:28.349> set<00:02:28.620> this<00:02:28.769> timer<00:02:29.069> for

00:02:29.360 --> 00:02:29.370 
beginning and then I set this timer for

00:02:29.370 --> 00:02:31.220 
beginning and then I set this timer for
20<00:02:29.670> minutes<00:02:30.000> because<00:02:30.209> that's<00:02:30.540> how<00:02:30.840> much<00:02:31.019> the

00:02:31.220 --> 00:02:31.230 
20 minutes because that's how much the

00:02:31.230 --> 00:02:33.949 
20 minutes because that's how much the
bentonite<00:02:31.650> clay<00:02:31.709> takes<00:02:32.280> to<00:02:32.519> dry<00:02:32.819> and<00:02:33.150> this<00:02:33.720> is

bentonite clay takes to dry and this is

00:02:33.959 --> 00:02:36.349 
bentonite clay takes to dry and this is
how<00:02:34.170> it<00:02:34.349> looks<00:02:34.620> after<00:02:34.980> it<00:02:35.430> is<00:02:35.549> done<00:02:35.730> drying<00:02:36.060> I

00:02:36.349 --> 00:02:36.359 
how it looks after it is done drying I

00:02:36.359 --> 00:02:39.679 
how it looks after it is done drying I
look<00:02:36.540> like<00:02:36.689> a<00:02:36.720> black<00:02:37.109> Hulk<00:02:38.239> but<00:02:39.239> then<00:02:39.390> after

00:02:39.679 --> 00:02:39.689 
look like a black Hulk but then after

00:02:39.689 --> 00:02:41.119
