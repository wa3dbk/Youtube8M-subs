pigs<00:01:49.409> will<00:01:49.649> start<00:01:49.950> out<00:01:50.100> a<00:01:50.130> little<00:01:50.369> slow<00:01:50.700> but

00:01:50.719 --> 00:01:50.729 
pigs will start out a little slow but

00:01:50.729 --> 00:01:52.550 
pigs will start out a little slow but
the<00:01:51.000> end<00:01:51.149> up<00:01:51.299> going<00:01:51.570> about<00:01:51.630> five<00:01:51.960> blocks<00:01:52.140> per

00:01:52.550 --> 00:01:52.560 
the end up going about five blocks per

00:01:52.560 --> 00:01:54.920 
the end up going about five blocks per
second<00:01:53.009> which<00:01:53.250> dinner<00:01:54.119> bone<00:01:54.329> is<00:01:54.450> estimated

00:01:54.920 --> 00:01:54.930 
second which dinner bone is estimated

00:01:54.930 --> 00:01:57.679 
second which dinner bone is estimated
but<00:01:55.020> that's<00:01:55.170> about<00:01:55.380> walking<00:01:55.740> speed<00:01:56.280> for<00:01:57.180> most

00:01:57.679 --> 00:01:57.689 
but that's about walking speed for most

00:01:57.689 --> 00:02:01.370 
but that's about walking speed for most
people<00:01:58.530> in<00:01:58.740> Minecraft<00:01:59.810> so<00:02:00.810> hopefully<00:02:00.990> maybe

00:02:01.370 --> 00:02:01.380 
people in Minecraft so hopefully maybe

00:02:01.380 --> 00:02:02.749 
people in Minecraft so hopefully maybe
we'll<00:02:01.649> have<00:02:01.770> ability<00:02:02.159> to<00:02:02.189> feed<00:02:02.430> them<00:02:02.579> like<00:02:02.729> a

00:02:02.749 --> 00:02:02.759 
we'll have ability to feed them like a

00:02:02.759 --> 00:02:04.219 
we'll have ability to feed them like a
carrot<00:02:03.119> or<00:02:03.180> a<00:02:03.270> gold<00:02:03.479> carrot<00:02:03.840> to<00:02:03.930> make<00:02:04.079> them

00:02:04.219 --> 00:02:04.229 
carrot or a gold carrot to make them

00:02:04.229 --> 00:02:06.679 
carrot or a gold carrot to make them
speed<00:02:04.590> up<00:02:04.740> or<00:02:04.950> something<00:02:05.270> but<00:02:06.270> who<00:02:06.509> knows

00:02:06.679 --> 00:02:06.689 
speed up or something but who knows

00:02:06.689 --> 00:02:07.969 
speed up or something but who knows
still<00:02:07.170> pretty<00:02:07.350> cool<00:02:07.530> we're<00:02:07.710> actually<00:02:07.799> gonna

00:02:07.969 --> 00:02:07.979 
still pretty cool we're actually gonna

00:02:07.979 --> 00:02:09.350

00:02:09.360 --> 00:02:11.960 
be able to ride around on pigs and have
races<00:02:09.810> I<00:02:10.080> wish<00:02:11.039> that<00:02:11.280> we'd<00:02:11.520> be<00:02:11.640> able<00:02:11.670> to<00:02:11.849> use

00:02:11.960 --> 00:02:11.970

00:02:11.970 --> 00:02:13.340 
races I wish that we'd be able to use
swords<00:02:12.360> and<00:02:12.510> bows<00:02:12.540> while<00:02:12.900> on<00:02:12.989> top<00:02:13.140> of

swords and bows while on top of
pig<00:02:13.530> will<00:02:13.770> still<00:02:13.980> am<00:02:14.040> in<00:02:14.130> control<00:02:14.310> but<00:02:14.700> maybe

00:02:15.200 --> 00:02:15.210 
pig will still am in control but maybe

00:02:15.210 --> 00:02:16.790 
pig will still am in control but maybe
that'll<00:02:15.480> be<00:02:15.540> something<00:02:15.690> in<00:02:15.900> the<00:02:15.960> future<00:02:16.110> now

00:02:16.790 --> 00:02:16.800 
that'll be something in the future now

00:02:16.800 --> 00:02:19.010 
that'll be something in the future now
they're<00:02:17.310> still<00:02:17.640> not<00:02:17.790> going<00:02:18.150> to<00:02:18.240> be<00:02:18.330> no<00:02:18.540> saddle

in this picture we see skulls skeleton
skulls<00:03:34.760> specifically<00:03:35.760> but<00:03:36.060> they<00:03:36.240> could<00:03:36.420> also

00:03:36.440 --> 00:03:36.450 
skulls specifically but they could also

00:03:36.450 --> 00:03:38.410 
skulls specifically but they could also
be<00:03:36.750> zombie<00:03:37.080> or<00:03:37.170> player<00:03:37.410> skulls<00:03:37.770> technically

be zombie or player skulls technically

00:03:38.420 --> 00:03:41.510 
be zombie or player skulls technically
and<00:03:39.420> these<00:03:40.110> look<00:03:40.650> like<00:03:40.710> they've<00:03:40.980> been<00:03:41.160> placed

00:03:41.510 --> 00:03:41.520 
and these look like they've been placed

00:03:41.520 --> 00:03:43.550 
and these look like they've been placed
inside<00:03:41.790> of<00:03:42.150> little<00:03:42.480> like<00:03:42.690> parts<00:03:43.140> on<00:03:43.260> the<00:03:43.350> wall

00:03:43.550 --> 00:03:43.560 
inside of little like parts on the wall

00:03:43.560 --> 00:03:47.900 
inside of little like parts on the wall
as<00:03:43.860> decoration<00:03:44.640> now<00:03:45.320> they<00:03:46.320> may<00:03:46.530> drop<00:03:46.860> from<00:03:47.310> you

00:03:47.900 --> 00:03:47.910 
as decoration now they may drop from you

as decoration now they may drop from you
know<00:03:48.000> mobs<00:03:48.330> but<00:03:48.690> we're<00:03:49.140> also<00:03:49.350> wondering

00:03:50.030 --> 00:03:50.040 
know mobs but we're also wondering

00:03:50.040 --> 00:03:53.000 
know mobs but we're also wondering
whether<00:03:50.840> other<00:03:51.840> mobs<00:03:52.230> will<00:03:52.410> drop<00:03:52.650> their<00:03:52.830> heads

00:03:53.000 --> 00:03:53.010 
whether other mobs will drop their heads

00:03:53.010 --> 00:03:54.860 
whether other mobs will drop their heads
too<00:03:53.280> if<00:03:53.490> these<00:03:53.670> are<00:03:53.820> just<00:03:53.970> exclusively<00:03:54.390> from

00:03:54.860 --> 00:03:54.870 
too if these are just exclusively from

00:03:54.870 --> 00:03:57.860 
too if these are just exclusively from
skeletons<00:03:55.500> or<00:03:56.120> what<00:03:57.120> more<00:03:57.300> will<00:03:57.450> get<00:03:57.660> because

00:03:57.860 --> 00:03:57.870 
skeletons or what more will get because

00:03:57.870 --> 00:04:01.160 
skeletons or what more will get because
he<00:03:58.020> did<00:03:58.200> say<00:03:58.380> more<00:03:58.830> decoration<00:03:59.520> blocks<00:04:00.170> plural

00:04:01.160 --> 00:04:01.170 
he did say more decoration blocks plural

00:04:01.170 --> 00:04:04.130 
he did say more decoration blocks plural
so<00:04:01.710> who<00:04:01.890> knows<00:04:02.100> the<00:04:02.880> trophy<00:04:03.240> idea<00:04:03.690> that<00:04:03.870> I<00:04:03.900> had

00:04:04.130 --> 00:04:04.140 
so who knows the trophy idea that I had

00:04:04.140 --> 00:04:07.070 
so who knows the trophy idea that I had
with<00:04:04.410> mounting<00:04:05.190> items<00:04:05.760> on<00:04:06.000> the<00:04:06.210> item<00:04:06.750> frame<00:04:06.930> to

00:04:07.070 --> 00:04:07.080 
with mounting items on the item frame to

00:04:07.080 --> 00:04:08.750 
with mounting items on the item frame to
make<00:04:07.680> it<00:04:07.800> look<00:04:07.890> like<00:04:08.040> a<00:04:08.100> trophy<00:04:08.400> above<00:04:08.640> your

00:04:08.750 --> 00:04:08.760 
make it look like a trophy above your

00:04:08.760 --> 00:04:10.190 
make it look like a trophy above your
fireplace<00:04:08.910> maybe<00:04:09.360> we<00:04:09.630> don't<00:04:09.720> need<00:04:09.840> to<00:04:10.020> do<00:04:10.170> that

00:04:10.190 --> 00:04:10.200 
fireplace maybe we don't need to do that

00:04:10.200 --> 00:04:12.050 
fireplace maybe we don't need to do that
because<00:04:10.560> we'll<00:04:10.860> have<00:04:10.890> these<00:04:11.250> mob<00:04:11.550> heads<00:04:11.850> in

00:04:12.050 --> 00:04:12.060 
because we'll have these mob heads in

00:04:12.060 --> 00:04:14.510 
because we'll have these mob heads in

00:04:28.370 --> 00:04:28.380 
working on the beacon block because that

00:04:28.380 --> 00:04:29.690 
working on the beacon block because that
was<00:04:28.500> originally<00:04:28.920> one<00:04:29.100> of<00:04:29.190> the<00:04:29.280> things<00:04:29.550> that

00:04:29.690 --> 00:04:29.700 
was originally one of the things that

00:04:29.700 --> 00:04:33.020 
was originally one of the things that
would<00:04:30.000> use<00:04:30.360> a<00:04:30.390> lot<00:04:30.720> of<00:04:30.750> loot<00:04:31.080> to<00:04:31.830> be<00:04:32.820> able<00:04:32.880> to

00:04:33.020 --> 00:04:33.030 
would use a lot of loot to be able to

00:04:33.030 --> 00:04:35.450 
would use a lot of loot to be able to
use<00:04:33.120> properly<00:04:33.570> with<00:04:33.840> all<00:04:34.080> the<00:04:34.380> benefits<00:04:35.040> so

00:04:35.450 --> 00:04:35.460 
use properly with all the benefits so

00:04:35.460 --> 00:04:37.580 
use properly with all the benefits so
hopefully<00:04:36.300> we'll<00:04:36.570> get<00:04:36.690> more<00:04:36.750> reasons<00:04:37.290> to<00:04:37.380> keep

00:04:37.580 --> 00:04:37.590
