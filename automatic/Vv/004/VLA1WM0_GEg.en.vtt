wasn't just necessary native people what

00:00:31.320 --> 00:00:33.229 
wasn't just necessary native people what
it<00:00:31.439> started<00:00:31.800> out<00:00:31.920> as<00:00:32.130> being<00:00:32.160> you<00:00:32.669> know<00:00:32.700> Indian

00:00:33.229 --> 00:00:33.239 
it started out as being you know Indian

00:00:33.239 --> 00:00:36.229 
it started out as being you know Indian
people<00:00:33.630> there<00:00:34.410> was<00:00:34.500> more<00:00:34.710> just<00:00:34.950> community<00:00:35.460> you

00:00:36.229 --> 00:00:36.239 
people there was more just community you

00:00:36.239 --> 00:00:37.459 
people there was more just community you
know<00:00:36.360> and<00:00:36.510> let's<00:00:36.750> think<00:00:36.899> about<00:00:37.050> the<00:00:37.260> fish

00:00:37.459 --> 00:00:37.469 
know and let's think about the fish

00:00:37.469 --> 00:00:39.950 
know and let's think about the fish
because<00:00:37.829> the<00:00:38.010> fish<00:00:38.040> are<00:00:38.340> like<00:00:38.690> that's<00:00:39.690> our

00:00:39.950 --> 00:00:39.960 
because the fish are like that's our

00:00:39.960 --> 00:00:41.869 
because the fish are like that's our
staples<00:00:40.680> you<00:00:41.190> know<00:00:41.250> that's<00:00:41.460> who<00:00:41.610> we<00:00:41.730> are

00:00:41.869 --> 00:00:41.879 
staples you know that's who we are

00:00:41.879 --> 00:00:43.400 
staples you know that's who we are
that's<00:00:42.059> how<00:00:42.239> we<00:00:42.300> you<00:00:42.809> know<00:00:42.899> grew<00:00:43.110> up<00:00:43.200> in<00:00:43.290> this

00:00:43.400 --> 00:00:43.410 
that's how we you know grew up in this

00:00:43.410 --> 00:00:46.069 
that's how we you know grew up in this
world<00:00:43.680> is<00:00:43.890> by<00:00:44.129> eating<00:00:44.309> fish<00:00:44.660> every<00:00:45.660> year<00:00:45.809> it

00:00:46.069 --> 00:00:46.079 
world is by eating fish every year it

00:00:46.079 --> 00:00:48.560 
world is by eating fish every year it
you<00:00:46.379> know<00:00:46.500> evolves<00:00:47.160> into<00:00:47.480> different<00:00:48.480> things

00:00:48.560 --> 00:00:48.570 
you know evolves into different things

00:00:48.570 --> 00:00:50.660 
you know evolves into different things
and<00:00:49.170> we<00:00:49.260> put<00:00:49.440> a<00:00:49.469> little<00:00:49.620> different<00:00:49.950> facets<00:00:50.399> but

00:00:50.660 --> 00:00:50.670 
and we put a little different facets but

00:00:50.670 --> 00:00:52.670 
and we put a little different facets but
it's<00:00:51.180> pretty<00:00:51.360> much<00:00:51.570> started<00:00:52.079> from<00:00:52.230> this<00:00:52.379> you

00:00:52.670 --> 00:00:52.680 
it's pretty much started from this you

00:00:52.680 --> 00:00:54.139 
it's pretty much started from this you
know<00:00:52.739> original<00:00:53.190> thing<00:00:53.370> you<00:00:53.550> know<00:00:53.640> eat<00:00:53.850> fish

00:00:54.139 --> 00:00:54.149 
know original thing you know eat fish

00:00:54.149 --> 00:00:56.869 
know original thing you know eat fish
put<00:00:54.809> the<00:00:54.930> bones<00:00:55.110> back<00:00:55.410> into<00:00:55.739> the<00:00:55.829> water<00:00:56.010> so<00:00:56.730> the

00:00:56.869 --> 00:00:56.879 
put the bones back into the water so the

00:00:56.879 --> 00:00:58.580 
put the bones back into the water so the
fish<00:00:57.090> can<00:00:57.120> come<00:00:57.449> back<00:00:57.600> and<00:00:57.809> come<00:00:58.230> back<00:00:58.260> there

00:00:58.580 --> 00:00:58.590 
fish can come back and come back there

00:00:58.590 --> 00:01:00.799 
fish can come back and come back there
because<00:00:58.770> fish<00:00:59.070> smell<00:00:59.399> they<00:01:00.000> smell<00:01:00.030> themselves

00:01:00.799 --> 00:01:00.809 
because fish smell they smell themselves

00:01:00.809 --> 00:01:03.860 
because fish smell they smell themselves
so<00:01:01.770> if<00:01:02.100> they're<00:01:02.309> if<00:01:02.640> they're<00:01:02.850> here<00:01:03.300> you<00:01:03.780> know

00:01:03.860 --> 00:01:03.870 
so if they're if they're here you know

00:01:03.870 --> 00:01:05.899 
so if they're if they're here you know
this<00:01:04.080> far<00:01:04.409> up<00:01:04.650> the<00:01:04.830> river<00:01:05.010> because<00:01:05.519> we're<00:01:05.700> way

00:01:05.899 --> 00:01:05.909 
this far up the river because we're way

00:01:05.909 --> 00:01:09.260 
this far up the river because we're way
up<00:01:06.270> the<00:01:06.390> river<00:01:06.540> up<00:01:06.780> here<00:01:07.250> they'll<00:01:08.250> come<00:01:09.060> back

00:01:09.260 --> 00:01:09.270 
up the river up here they'll come back

00:01:09.270 --> 00:01:10.850 
up the river up here they'll come back
and<00:01:09.330> that's<00:01:09.689> the<00:01:09.840> ideas<00:01:10.200> since<00:01:10.530> we've<00:01:10.740> started

00:01:10.850 --> 00:01:10.860 
and that's the ideas since we've started

00:01:10.860 --> 00:01:13.130 
and that's the ideas since we've started
this<00:01:11.189> 13<00:01:11.580> years<00:01:11.760> ago<00:01:12.000> it's<00:01:12.240> the<00:01:12.510> fish<00:01:12.900> count

00:01:13.130 --> 00:01:13.140 
this 13 years ago it's the fish count

00:01:13.140 --> 00:01:17.359 
this 13 years ago it's the fish count
has<00:01:13.320> like<00:01:13.500> increased<00:01:14.070> by<00:01:14.310> tenfold<00:01:16.009> our<00:01:17.009> belief

00:01:17.359 --> 00:01:17.369 
has like increased by tenfold our belief

00:01:17.369 --> 00:01:19.460 
has like increased by tenfold our belief
are<00:01:17.610> not<00:01:18.299> believed<00:01:18.570> but<00:01:18.780> our<00:01:18.930> thought<00:01:19.170> is<00:01:19.439> that

00:01:19.460 --> 00:01:19.470 
are not believed but our thought is that

00:01:19.470 --> 00:01:22.460 
are not believed but our thought is that
if<00:01:20.400> we<00:01:20.580> bring<00:01:20.850> the<00:01:20.970> community<00:01:21.150> together<00:01:21.470> the

00:01:22.460 --> 00:01:22.470 
if we bring the community together the

00:01:22.470 --> 00:01:25.660 
if we bring the community together the
land<00:01:22.710> will<00:01:22.920> heal<00:01:23.130> itself<00:01:23.630> you<00:01:24.630> know<00:01:24.750> because

00:01:25.660 --> 00:01:25.670 
land will heal itself you know because

00:01:25.670 --> 00:01:27.410 
land will heal itself you know because
everybody's<00:01:26.670> always<00:01:26.790> thinking<00:01:27.119> about<00:01:27.210> how

00:01:27.410 --> 00:01:27.420 
everybody's always thinking about how

00:01:27.420 --> 00:01:28.700 
everybody's always thinking about how
can<00:01:27.600> we<00:01:27.659> do<00:01:27.840> it<00:01:27.960> you<00:01:28.049> know<00:01:28.110> how<00:01:28.229> can<00:01:28.380> we<00:01:28.409> do<00:01:28.560> how

00:01:28.700 --> 00:01:28.710 
can we do it you know how can we do how

00:01:28.710 --> 00:01:30.319 
can we do it you know how can we do how
can<00:01:28.950> we<00:01:29.130> do<00:01:29.250> this<00:01:29.400> how<00:01:29.579> we<00:01:29.640> can<00:01:29.820> do<00:01:29.909> that<00:01:30.060> and<00:01:30.240> if

00:01:30.319 --> 00:01:30.329 
can we do this how we can do that and if

00:01:30.329 --> 00:01:31.310 
can we do this how we can do that and if
you<00:01:30.420> just<00:01:30.540> bring<00:01:30.689> the<00:01:30.840> community<00:01:31.020> together

00:01:35.690 --> 00:01:35.700 
and let's think of us get that

00:01:35.700 --> 00:01:38.870 
and let's think of us get that
consciousness<00:01:36.180> going<00:01:36.630> then<00:01:37.640> that's<00:01:38.640> why<00:01:38.820> you

00:01:38.870 --> 00:01:38.880 
consciousness going then that's why you

00:01:38.880 --> 00:01:40.249 
consciousness going then that's why you
know<00:01:39.090> that's<00:01:39.270> why<00:01:39.450> we<00:01:39.600> started<00:01:39.900> this<00:01:40.049> um

00:01:40.249 --> 00:01:40.259 
know that's why we started this um

00:01:40.259 --> 00:01:41.179 
know that's why we started this um
that's<00:01:40.500> where<00:01:40.619> my<00:01:40.680> grandma<00:01:40.979> started

00:01:41.179 --> 00:01:41.189
