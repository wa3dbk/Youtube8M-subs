fine<00:00:59.540> have<00:00:59.900> enough<00:01:00.170> clearance<00:01:00.440> here<00:01:00.680> for<00:01:00.829> my

00:01:00.910 --> 00:01:00.920 
fine have enough clearance here for my

00:01:00.920 --> 00:01:02.319 
fine have enough clearance here for my
washer<00:01:01.280> that<00:01:01.400> goes<00:01:01.460> in<00:01:01.730> behind<00:01:02.030> the<00:01:02.089> trailing

00:01:02.319 --> 00:01:02.329 
washer that goes in behind the trailing

00:01:02.329 --> 00:01:04.990 
washer that goes in behind the trailing
arm<00:01:02.570> I<00:01:02.840> think<00:01:03.469> with<00:01:03.559> the<00:01:03.649> next<00:01:03.920> side<00:01:04.100> I'll<00:01:04.610> go

00:01:04.990 --> 00:01:05.000 
arm I think with the next side I'll go

00:01:05.000 --> 00:01:07.180 
arm I think with the next side I'll go
over<00:01:05.119> and<00:01:05.449> I'll<00:01:05.720> actually<00:01:06.080> heat<00:01:06.259> it<00:01:06.380> up<00:01:06.530> now

00:01:07.180 --> 00:01:07.190 
over and I'll actually heat it up now

00:01:07.190 --> 00:01:08.950 
over and I'll actually heat it up now
mold<00:01:07.550> it<00:01:07.759> over<00:01:07.970> I'll<00:01:08.119> just<00:01:08.240> use<00:01:08.390> my<00:01:08.539> torch<00:01:08.780> and

00:01:08.950 --> 00:01:08.960 
mold it over I'll just use my torch and

00:01:08.960 --> 00:01:10.450 
mold it over I'll just use my torch and
see<00:01:09.050> if<00:01:09.140> I<00:01:09.200> can<00:01:09.350> just<00:01:09.500> warm<00:01:09.740> that<00:01:09.890> up<00:01:09.920> enough<00:01:10.280> to

00:01:10.450 --> 00:01:10.460 
see if I can just warm that up enough to

00:01:10.460 --> 00:01:12.370 
see if I can just warm that up enough to
sort<00:01:11.060> of<00:01:11.210> mold<00:01:11.390> it<00:01:11.570> and<00:01:11.690> bend<00:01:11.869> it<00:01:11.960> a<00:01:12.050> little<00:01:12.080> bit

00:01:12.370 --> 00:01:12.380 
sort of mold it and bend it a little bit

00:01:12.380 --> 00:01:13.840 
sort of mold it and bend it a little bit
I've<00:01:12.530> never<00:01:12.710> heated<00:01:13.009> this<00:01:13.130> type<00:01:13.310> of<00:01:13.340> material

00:01:13.840 --> 00:01:13.850
