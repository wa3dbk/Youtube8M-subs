00:01:03.920 --> 00:01:03.930 
to cheat a little chip over the key

00:01:03.930 --> 00:01:08.090 
to cheat a little chip over the key
behind<00:01:04.140> we<00:01:04.500> are<00:01:04.619> one<00:01:04.860> nil<00:01:05.810> spin<00:01:06.810> can<00:01:07.799> you<00:01:07.830> chip

00:01:08.090 --> 00:01:08.100 
behind we are one nil spin can you chip

00:01:08.100 --> 00:01:10.429 
behind we are one nil spin can you chip
it<00:01:08.250> can<00:01:08.700> teach<00:01:08.820> ibid<00:01:09.150> who<00:01:09.930> you're<00:01:10.080> scoring

00:01:16.100 --> 00:01:16.110 
know and we have a spinning circle so

00:01:16.110 --> 00:01:18.140 
know and we have a spinning circle so
that's<00:01:16.350> gotta<00:01:16.619> be<00:01:16.680> arranged<00:01:17.040> quit<00:01:17.310> as<00:01:17.430> well<00:01:17.640> ok

00:01:18.140 --> 00:01:18.150 
that's gotta be arranged quit as well ok

that's gotta be arranged quit as well ok
so<00:01:18.210> we're<00:01:18.420> sitting<00:01:18.540> on<00:01:18.689> six<00:01:18.990> points<00:01:19.409> now<00:01:19.560> from

00:01:19.910 --> 00:01:19.920 
so we're sitting on six points now from

00:01:19.920 --> 00:01:22.429 
so we're sitting on six points now from
the<00:01:20.040> division<00:01:20.400> from<00:01:20.640> two<00:01:20.850> games<00:01:21.180> and<00:01:21.479> yeah<00:01:22.409> I

this guy was very good at defending most

00:03:10.780 --> 00:03:11.940 
this guy was very good at defending most
of<00:03:10.900> the<00:03:10.959> time<00:03:11.110> we<00:03:11.200> could<00:03:11.350> keep<00:03:11.530> him<00:03:11.709> away<00:03:11.920> from

00:03:11.940 --> 00:03:11.950 
of the time we could keep him away from

00:03:11.950 --> 00:03:15.060 
of the time we could keep him away from
chances<00:03:12.610> but<00:03:12.790> he<00:03:13.030> almost<00:03:13.320> almost<00:03:14.320> got<00:03:14.860> to<00:03:14.950> go

00:03:15.060 --> 00:03:15.070 
chances but he almost almost got to go

00:03:15.070 --> 00:03:16.949 
chances but he almost almost got to go
there<00:03:15.280> towards<00:03:15.640> the<00:03:15.670> end<00:03:15.760> in<00:03:16.239> the<00:03:16.450> game<00:03:16.660> but

00:03:16.949 --> 00:03:16.959 
there towards the end in the game but

00:03:16.959 --> 00:03:18.840 
there towards the end in the game but
him<00:03:17.110> we<00:03:17.830> get<00:03:17.980> the<00:03:18.130> win<00:03:18.310> we<00:03:18.519> got<00:03:18.640> three<00:03:18.820> more

00:03:18.840 --> 00:03:18.850 
him we get the win we got three more

00:03:18.850 --> 00:03:20.520 
him we get the win we got three more
points<00:03:19.209> that<00:03:19.540> means<00:03:19.750> we're<00:03:19.959> sitting<00:03:20.230> on<00:03:20.290> nine

00:03:20.520 --> 00:03:20.530 
points that means we're sitting on nine

00:03:20.530 --> 00:03:22.770 
points that means we're sitting on nine
points<00:03:21.070> from<00:03:21.310> three<00:03:21.640> games<00:03:21.820> and<00:03:22.209> then<00:03:22.690> we're

00:03:22.770 --> 00:03:22.780 
points from three games and then we're

00:03:22.780 --> 00:03:24.509 
points from three games and then we're
gonna<00:03:22.870> play<00:03:23.050> one<00:03:23.290> more<00:03:23.410> game<00:03:23.470> in<00:03:23.890> this

00:03:24.509 --> 00:03:24.519 
gonna play one more game in this

00:03:24.519 --> 00:03:26.040 
gonna play one more game in this
division<00:03:24.940> and<00:03:25.269> I<00:03:25.330> think<00:03:25.510> we<00:03:25.630> might<00:03:25.750> change

00:03:26.040 --> 00:03:26.050 
division and I think we might change

00:03:26.050 --> 00:03:28.290 
division and I think we might change
back<00:03:26.320> to<00:03:26.350> the<00:03:26.680> lineup<00:03:27.010> you<00:03:27.040> have<00:03:27.160> before<00:03:27.790> it

00:03:28.290 --> 00:03:28.300 
back to the lineup you have before it

00:03:28.300 --> 00:03:29.790 
back to the lineup you have before it
