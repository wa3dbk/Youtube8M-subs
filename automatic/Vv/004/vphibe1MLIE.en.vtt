00:00:06.920 --> 00:00:11.510
 el pedro ximénez an elaborated sweet wine 

00:00:09.800 --> 00:00:14.090
 with our variety of works by sergio 

00:00:11.510 --> 00:00:16.189
 meneses 100% pedro jiménez therefore 

00:00:14.090 --> 00:00:17.689
 It is a sweet wine that takes the name of 

00:00:16.189 --> 00:00:19.070
 the variety with which the 

00:00:17.689 --> 00:00:21.349
 most important feature of the 

00:00:19.070 --> 00:00:23.810
 pedro jiménez in addition to his fine skin his 

00:00:21.349 --> 00:00:26.029
 juicy pulp the size fence 

00:00:23.810 --> 00:00:27.470
 intermediate large enclosure is that it has 

00:00:26.029 --> 00:00:29.630
 a concentration of sugars very 

00:00:27.470 --> 00:00:31.070
 elevated to processors is very 

00:00:29.630 --> 00:00:32.689
 important because after fermentation 

00:00:31.070 --> 00:00:34.309
 with this amount of sugars 

00:00:32.689 --> 00:00:36.800
 we get an alcoholic graduation 

00:00:34.309 --> 00:00:38.870
 very high in such a way that we do not have 

00:00:36.800 --> 00:00:41.239
 why add alcohol 

00:00:38.870 --> 00:00:42.649
 externally it is a hawk totally 

00:00:41.239 --> 00:00:44.690
 natural for this concentration of 

00:00:42.649 --> 00:00:47.750
 so high sugars makes it ideal 

00:00:44.690 --> 00:00:49.850
 for the classification the elaboration is 

00:00:47.750 --> 00:00:51.680
 of 2 jiménez starts on the lines in 

00:00:49.850 --> 00:00:53.329
 line is a very selected vintage 

00:00:51.680 --> 00:00:55.790
 very carefully 

00:00:53.329 --> 00:00:57.649
 we are choosing fields in clusters of 

00:00:55.790 --> 00:00:59.059
 greater healthiness and greater or better 

00:00:57.649 --> 00:01:00.680
 ripening point 

00:00:59.059 --> 00:01:03.260
 once we cut the cluster what 

00:01:00.680 --> 00:01:05.540
 We carry in boxes because the berry 

00:01:03.260 --> 00:01:07.220
 he receives less physical damage therefore he goes 

00:01:05.540 --> 00:01:09.619
 to get better conditions for your 

00:01:07.220 --> 00:01:12.289
 subsequent milling once the 

00:01:09.619 --> 00:01:14.119
 boxes are complete we take them to 

00:01:12.289 --> 00:01:15.710
 the placeras or to níjar where we go to 

00:01:14.119 --> 00:01:18.679
 sun we are placing them in the 

00:01:15.710 --> 00:01:21.289
 midwife is in esparto pots 

00:01:18.679 --> 00:01:23.479
 or other inert materials these 

00:01:21.289 --> 00:01:26.000
 Clusters carefully so that the sun goes 

00:01:23.479 --> 00:01:28.369
 acting on them and go sunning 

00:01:26.000 --> 00:01:30.800
 a grape is a process that is homogeneous 

00:01:28.369 --> 00:01:32.899
 because every two or three routes make a 

00:01:30.800 --> 00:01:34.880
 turning these clusters so that 

00:01:32.899 --> 00:01:37.280
 can sun all the bunch equally 

00:01:34.880 --> 00:01:39.979
 once the grape boxes pass 

00:01:37.280 --> 00:01:42.930
 arrives at the press we go to the phase of 

00:01:39.979 --> 00:01:45.000
 grinding engine extraction 

00:01:42.930 --> 00:01:47.820
 the first parts of this phase where 

00:01:45.000 --> 00:01:50.240
 two rubber rollers are exerting 

00:01:47.820 --> 00:01:53.010
 a slight pressure on these for 

00:01:50.240 --> 00:01:55.350
 get most of the monster and more 

00:01:53.010 --> 00:01:57.690
 sweet is like the biggest fraction of the 

00:01:55.350 --> 00:02:00.450
 final must later to continue 

00:01:57.690 --> 00:02:02.400
 taking advantage of this mass of grapes we passed to 

00:02:00.450 --> 00:02:04.740
 the horizontal presses and finally 

00:02:02.400 --> 00:02:06.510
 for vertical presses or presses 

00:02:04.740 --> 00:02:09.060
 Hydraulics that are like oil 

00:02:06.510 --> 00:02:10.770
 once we get this amount then what 

00:02:09.060 --> 00:02:12.300
 we have to update alcohol 

00:02:10.770 --> 00:02:13.860
 we are partially until we get a 

00:02:12.300 --> 00:02:15.570
 monster of 9 degrees of alcohol that 

00:02:13.860 --> 00:02:17.550
 combined buds and already later each 

00:02:15.570 --> 00:02:20.300
 Bodeguero decides what his grade will be 

00:02:17.550 --> 00:02:20.300
 of final alcohol 

00:02:29.420 --> 00:02:34.640
 because the face of Pedro Jiménez is very 

00:02:32.300 --> 00:02:36.230
 special especially knowing that we have 

00:02:34.640 --> 00:02:37.310
 several types of pedro jiménez of each 

00:02:36.230 --> 00:02:38.230
 we have to find him some 

00:02:37.310 --> 00:02:41.420
 organoleptic characteristics 

00:02:38.230 --> 00:02:43.110
 different the first phase of a tasting 

00:02:41.420 --> 00:02:45.840
 in the visual phase 

00:02:43.110 --> 00:02:47.580
 for this I will take the other key 

00:02:45.840 --> 00:02:49.410
 from pedro jiménez that we can have for 

00:02:47.580 --> 00:02:51.840
 to be able to differentiate them well the pedro 

00:02:49.410 --> 00:02:53.970
 ximénez young visually one more color 

00:02:51.840 --> 00:02:57.120
 amber and it's not like the monster of the 

00:02:53.970 --> 00:02:59.580
 house or technically both in color and 

00:02:57.120 --> 00:03:03.420
 in aromas the aromas are more fruity 

00:02:59.580 --> 00:03:05.250
 prunes to honey however at 

00:03:03.420 --> 00:03:07.890
 dog and breeding germs has a 

00:03:05.250 --> 00:03:09.870
 color plus dark mahogany and its 

00:03:07.890 --> 00:03:12.330
 fundamental characteristic 

00:03:09.870 --> 00:03:14.700
 both have golden glitter or 

00:03:12.330 --> 00:03:16.440
 helped both one and others the 

00:03:14.700 --> 00:03:18.580
 color difference basically by the 

00:03:16.440 --> 00:03:20.530
 swing of the wood 

00:03:18.580 --> 00:03:23.860
 the false grammar in the following 

00:03:20.530 --> 00:03:25.480
 phases I am of the visual describes us 

00:03:23.860 --> 00:03:27.760
 very much the grapes are primary aromas 

00:03:25.480 --> 00:03:30.790
 the primary aromas of a form of the 

00:03:27.760 --> 00:03:33.770
 variety aromas to raisins or very commented 

00:03:30.790 --> 00:03:36.350
 plum to fig bread 

00:03:33.770 --> 00:03:39.290
 we can even catch a very practical joke 

00:03:36.350 --> 00:03:40.880
 important especially for what is the 

00:03:39.290 --> 00:03:42.560
 acidity point of the wine that then 

00:03:40.880 --> 00:03:44.240
 invoke let's notice is the skin of 

00:03:42.560 --> 00:03:46.970
 orange 

00:03:44.240 --> 00:03:50.620
 they are more roasted aromas more to kaka 

00:03:46.970 --> 00:03:53.720
 two aromas to this happens more evolved 

00:03:50.620 --> 00:03:56.690
 we can even capture 

00:03:53.720 --> 00:03:59.240
 aromas of coffee is a variety of aromas 

00:03:56.690 --> 00:04:00.910
 impressive where we go to the 

00:03:59.240 --> 00:04:02.780
 last phases which is the gustatory phase 

00:04:00.910 --> 00:04:04.490
 we have to make all the wine 

00:04:02.780 --> 00:04:06.380
 run your mouth and tongue to notice 

00:04:04.490 --> 00:04:08.160
 especially the authority of this well 

00:04:06.380 --> 00:04:10.970
 in question 

00:04:08.160 --> 00:04:13.190
 It is a warm wine and makes 

00:04:10.970 --> 00:04:15.290
 you notice it all over your mouth and it even comes 

00:04:13.190 --> 00:04:17.180
 until the aftertaste the aromas that 

00:04:15.290 --> 00:04:21.820
 we spend on that product is still 

00:04:17.180 --> 00:04:21.820
 roasted coffee making takes too 

00:04:22.440 --> 00:04:26.430
 it's a set 

00:04:24.540 --> 00:04:29.190
 of sensations electric organ 

00:04:26.430 --> 00:04:31.700
 really persistent and very harmonious 

00:04:29.190 --> 00:04:33.960
 the pedro ximénez really is a jewel 

00:04:31.700 --> 00:04:37.800
 both its elaboration as I have explained 

00:04:33.960 --> 00:04:40.280
 before as in your upbringing and good and in your 

00:04:37.800 --> 00:04:40.280
 tasting no 

00:04:43.529 --> 00:04:48.269
 Pedro Ximénez wine by having that 

00:04:46.349 --> 00:04:51.299
 personality and character of crankcase 

00:04:48.269 --> 00:04:55.349
 nose as a sumptuousness in the mouth comes 

00:04:51.299 --> 00:04:57.749
 perfect with desserts and with sweets 

00:04:55.349 --> 00:05:00.089
 strong products such as cheeses and 

00:04:57.749 --> 00:05:01.769
 even with the black chocolates something 

00:05:00.089 --> 00:05:03.929
 very important of pedro jiménez is that 

00:05:01.769 --> 00:05:05.279
 It is a unique wine we elaborate it in 

00:05:03.929 --> 00:05:06.089
 córdoba was born of origin montilla 

00:05:05.279 --> 00:05:09.359
 moriles 

00:05:06.089 --> 00:05:11.489
 thanks to its temperature to its kind of 

00:05:09.359 --> 00:05:13.439
 I 'm going to the barista what the 

00:05:11.489 --> 00:05:15.569
 pedro jiménez to become this 

00:05:13.439 --> 00:05:19.009
 came and we do it here pedro jiménez 

00:05:15.569 --> 00:05:19.009
 is Cordovan par excellence
