00:02:20.870 --> 00:02:20.880 
something else well I was detecting

00:02:20.880 --> 00:02:25.370 
something else well I was detecting
along<00:02:21.150> and<00:02:21.510> this<00:02:21.690> junk<00:02:22.410> and<00:02:23.930> came<00:02:24.930> along<00:02:25.200> and

00:02:25.370 --> 00:02:25.380 
along and this junk and came along and

00:02:25.380 --> 00:02:28.970 
along and this junk and came along and
had<00:02:25.590> about<00:02:25.830> a<00:02:25.890> 9<00:02:26.430> 46<00:02:27.620> and<00:02:28.620> I'm<00:02:28.769> thinking

00:02:28.970 --> 00:02:28.980 
had about a 9 46 and I'm thinking

00:02:28.980 --> 00:02:33.229 
had about a 9 46 and I'm thinking
possibly<00:02:29.459> quarter<00:02:30.150> and<00:02:31.790> was<00:02:32.790> pretty<00:02:32.970> shallow

00:02:33.229 --> 00:02:33.239 
possibly quarter and was pretty shallow

00:02:33.239 --> 00:02:41.330 
possibly quarter and was pretty shallow
so<00:02:33.600> I<00:02:33.660> was<00:02:33.810> unreal<00:02:34.140> optimistic<00:02:34.940> but<00:02:38.090> as<00:02:39.170> I<00:02:40.340> dug

00:02:41.330 --> 00:02:41.340 
so I was unreal optimistic but as I dug

00:02:41.340 --> 00:02:44.500 
so I was unreal optimistic but as I dug
it<00:02:41.489> up<00:02:41.870> turns<00:02:42.870> out<00:02:43.019> to<00:02:43.170> be<00:02:43.200> some<00:02:43.590> kind<00:02:43.769> of<00:02:43.860> token

00:02:44.500 --> 00:02:44.510 
it up turns out to be some kind of token

00:02:44.510 --> 00:02:48.410 
it up turns out to be some kind of token
looks<00:02:45.510> modern<00:02:46.190> got<00:02:47.190> a<00:02:47.220> dinosaur<00:02:47.940> token

00:02:48.410 --> 00:02:48.420

00:03:02.900 --> 00:03:02.910 
but I found a coin that I found here

00:03:02.910 --> 00:03:05.960 
but I found a coin that I found here
before<00:03:03.320> it<00:03:04.320> looks<00:03:04.530> like<00:03:04.680> the<00:03:04.829> same<00:03:05.040> type<00:03:05.940> of

00:03:05.960 --> 00:03:05.970

coin got a hole in the middle and the

00:03:09.150 --> 00:03:12.050 
coin got a hole in the middle and the
last<00:03:09.360> one<00:03:09.570> I<00:03:09.600> found<00:03:09.870> was<00:03:10.170> a<00:03:10.370> it's<00:03:11.370> a<00:03:11.459> one-cent

00:03:12.050 --> 00:03:12.060

in<00:06:47.439> 1900<00:06:48.129> and<00:06:49.349> then<00:06:50.349> the<00:06:51.250> last<00:06:51.400> coin<00:06:51.819> is<00:06:52.330> the

00:06:53.249 --> 00:06:53.259 
in 1900 and then the last coin is the

00:06:53.259 --> 00:06:57.959 
in 1900 and then the last coin is the
