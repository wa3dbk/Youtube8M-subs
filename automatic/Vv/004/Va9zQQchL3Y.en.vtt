like<00:01:25.369> ultimate<00:01:26.369> rares<00:01:26.549> I<00:01:26.729> don't<00:01:26.880> know<00:01:26.939> like

00:01:27.320 --> 00:01:27.330 
like ultimate rares I don't know like

00:01:27.330 --> 00:01:29.300 
like ultimate rares I don't know like
he's<00:01:27.689> showing<00:01:27.990> I<00:01:28.170> don't<00:01:28.380> know<00:01:28.500> like<00:01:29.130> there's

00:01:29.300 --> 00:01:29.310 
he's showing I don't know like there's

00:01:29.310 --> 00:01:31.219 
he's showing I don't know like there's
no<00:01:29.430> volume<00:01:29.790> on<00:01:29.909> this<00:01:30.090> because<00:01:30.509> there's<00:01:30.659> no

00:01:31.219 --> 00:01:31.229 
no volume on this because there's no

00:01:31.229 --> 00:01:33.370 
no volume on this because there's no
point<00:01:31.439> to<00:01:31.710> having<00:01:31.950> a<00:01:32.009> volume<00:01:32.189> others<00:01:32.520> but

00:01:33.370 --> 00:01:33.380 
point to having a volume others but

00:01:33.380 --> 00:01:36.140 
point to having a volume others but
basically<00:01:34.380> he's<00:01:34.590> turning<00:01:34.860> like<00:01:34.979> any<00:01:35.549> card

00:01:36.140 --> 00:01:36.150 
basically he's turning like any card

00:01:36.150 --> 00:01:37.190 
basically he's turning like any card
that<00:01:36.299> looks<00:01:36.450> like<00:01:36.509> a<00:01:36.600> super<00:01:36.840> original

00:01:37.190 --> 00:01:37.200 
that looks like a super original

00:01:37.200 --> 00:01:38.780 
that looks like a super original
ultra<00:01:37.439> rare<00:01:37.619> which<00:01:37.829> is<00:01:37.979> kind<00:01:38.220> of<00:01:38.280> cool<00:01:38.490> than<00:01:38.700> he

00:01:38.780 --> 00:01:38.790 
ultra rare which is kind of cool than he

00:01:38.790 --> 00:01:40.429 
ultra rare which is kind of cool than he
you<00:01:39.210> showing<00:01:39.450> off<00:01:39.509> a<00:01:39.570> cyber<00:01:39.869> dragon<00:01:40.290> he's

00:01:40.429 --> 00:01:40.439 
you showing off a cyber dragon he's

00:01:40.439 --> 00:01:42.140 
you showing off a cyber dragon he's
edged<00:01:40.680> in<00:01:41.009> different<00:01:41.460> angles<00:01:41.850> and<00:01:41.939> this<00:01:42.060> is

00:01:42.140 --> 00:01:42.150 
edged in different angles and this is

00:01:42.150 --> 00:01:44.240 
edged in different angles and this is
really<00:01:42.299> cool<00:01:42.509> for<00:01:42.720> anyone<00:01:43.170> that<00:01:43.320> does<00:01:43.500> you

really cool for anyone that does you

00:01:44.250 --> 00:01:45.889 
really cool for anyone that does you
know<00:01:44.340> alternate<00:01:44.759> artworks<00:01:45.030> you<00:01:45.210> your<00:01:45.390> cards<00:01:45.720> I

00:01:45.889 --> 00:01:45.899 
know alternate artworks you your cards I

00:01:45.899 --> 00:01:47.450 
know alternate artworks you your cards I
didn't<00:01:46.439> know<00:01:46.500> that<00:01:46.619> this<00:01:46.710> was<00:01:46.890> another<00:01:47.100> method

00:01:47.450 --> 00:01:47.460 
didn't know that this was another method

00:01:47.460 --> 00:01:49.630 
didn't know that this was another method
I<00:01:47.579> guess<00:01:47.790> you're<00:01:47.939> basically<00:01:48.299> scraping<00:01:48.840> off<00:01:49.049> or

00:01:49.630 --> 00:01:49.640 
I guess you're basically scraping off or

00:01:49.640 --> 00:01:52.700 
I guess you're basically scraping off or
kind<00:01:50.640> of<00:01:50.700> just<00:01:50.850> adding<00:01:51.750> texture<00:01:52.229> to<00:01:52.350> the<00:01:52.470> card

00:01:52.700 --> 00:01:52.710 
kind of just adding texture to the card

00:01:52.710 --> 00:01:54.859 
kind of just adding texture to the card
and<00:01:52.950> it<00:01:53.070> just<00:01:53.220> looks<00:01:53.369> so<00:01:53.520> cool<00:01:53.549> and<00:01:54.360> then

00:01:54.859 --> 00:01:54.869 
and it just looks so cool and then

00:01:54.869 --> 00:01:56.569 
and it just looks so cool and then
here's<00:01:54.990> the<00:01:55.049> redox<00:01:55.439> man<00:01:55.740> that<00:01:55.950> card<00:01:56.159> looks<00:01:56.340> so

00:01:56.569 --> 00:01:56.579 
here's the redox man that card looks so

00:01:56.579 --> 00:01:58.429 
here's the redox man that card looks so
awesome<00:01:57.119> and<00:01:57.299> the<00:01:57.719> way<00:01:57.840> he<00:01:57.990> kind<00:01:58.200> of<00:01:58.259> just

00:01:58.429 --> 00:01:58.439 
awesome and the way he kind of just

00:01:58.439 --> 00:02:01.249 
awesome and the way he kind of just
etched<00:01:58.619> out<00:01:58.890> some<00:01:59.189> of<00:01:59.280> the<00:01:59.340> UH<00:01:59.369> stuff<00:01:59.820> but<00:02:00.509> let

00:02:01.249 --> 00:02:01.259 
etched out some of the UH stuff but let

00:02:01.259 --> 00:02:03.139 
etched out some of the UH stuff but let
me<00:02:01.320> go<00:02:01.469> ahead<00:02:01.500> and<00:02:01.829> scroll<00:02:01.979> down<00:02:02.189> and<00:02:02.969> again

00:02:03.139 --> 00:02:03.149 
me go ahead and scroll down and again

00:02:03.149 --> 00:02:04.370 
me go ahead and scroll down and again
you<00:02:03.329> guys<00:02:03.420> could<00:02:03.630> go<00:02:03.689> check<00:02:03.899> it<00:02:03.990> I'll<00:02:04.079> post<00:02:04.350> a

all<00:02:06.240> the<00:02:06.360> stuff<00:02:06.540> he's<00:02:06.689> basically<00:02:06.930> showing<00:02:07.200> off

00:02:07.399 --> 00:02:07.409 
all the stuff he's basically showing off

00:02:07.409 --> 00:02:09.559 
all the stuff he's basically showing off
what<00:02:08.160> it<00:02:08.280> takes<00:02:08.489> so<00:02:08.759> you<00:02:08.789> need<00:02:09.090> to<00:02:09.209> make<00:02:09.360> one

00:02:09.559 --> 00:02:09.569 
what it takes so you need to make one

00:02:09.569 --> 00:02:09.900 
what it takes so you need to make one
addy

00:02:09.900 --> 00:02:09.910 
addy

00:02:11.460 --> 00:02:11.470 
and then he's putting it inside the card

00:02:11.470 --> 00:02:13.230 
and then he's putting it inside the card
and<00:02:11.710> you<00:02:12.220> guys<00:02:12.370> can<00:02:12.550> kind<00:02:12.640> of<00:02:12.760> see<00:02:12.820> like<00:02:12.910> how

00:02:13.230 --> 00:02:13.240 
and you guys can kind of see like how

00:02:13.240 --> 00:02:14.460 
and you guys can kind of see like how
it's<00:02:13.420> all<00:02:13.510> cut<00:02:13.720> out<00:02:13.870> it<00:02:14.050> looks<00:02:14.230> so<00:02:14.440> awesome

00:02:14.460 --> 00:02:14.470 
it's all cut out it looks so awesome

00:02:14.470 --> 00:02:17.490 
it's all cut out it looks so awesome
like<00:02:15.040> they<00:02:15.160> said<00:02:15.570> but<00:02:16.570> there's<00:02:17.020> one<00:02:17.170> I<00:02:17.230> want<00:02:17.440> to

00:02:17.490 --> 00:02:17.500 
like they said but there's one I want to

00:02:17.500 --> 00:02:19.740 
like they said but there's one I want to
show<00:02:17.650> you<00:02:17.710> guys<00:02:18.000> that<00:02:19.000> basically<00:02:19.450> shows<00:02:19.720> you

00:02:19.740 --> 00:02:19.750 
show you guys that basically shows you

00:02:19.750 --> 00:02:21.660 
show you guys that basically shows you
how<00:02:20.140> it<00:02:20.170> is<00:02:20.530> actually<00:02:20.740> less<00:02:21.190> chemical<00:02:21.580> it's

00:02:21.660 --> 00:02:21.670 
how it is actually less chemical it's

00:02:21.670 --> 00:02:23.070 
how it is actually less chemical it's
got<00:02:21.790> like<00:02:21.880> an<00:02:21.970> abacus<00:02:22.270> on<00:02:22.570> it<00:02:22.690> I<00:02:22.840> don't<00:02:23.020> know

00:02:23.070 --> 00:02:23.080 
got like an abacus on it I don't know

00:02:23.080 --> 00:02:25.620 
got like an abacus on it I don't know
but<00:02:23.920> here's<00:02:24.100> basically<00:02:24.670> the<00:02:24.790> rotation<00:02:25.240> of<00:02:25.390> one

00:02:25.620 --> 00:02:25.630 
but here's basically the rotation of one

00:02:25.630 --> 00:02:27.510 
but here's basically the rotation of one
the<00:02:25.780> card<00:02:26.020> so<00:02:26.230> you<00:02:26.290> can<00:02:26.380> see<00:02:26.650> that<00:02:27.370> he's

00:02:27.510 --> 00:02:27.520 
the card so you can see that he's

00:02:27.520 --> 00:02:29.250 
the card so you can see that he's
cutting<00:02:27.850> out<00:02:27.880> a<00:02:27.940> card<00:02:28.270> and<00:02:28.510> then<00:02:28.690> from<00:02:28.990> there

00:02:29.250 --> 00:02:29.260 
cutting out a card and then from there

00:02:29.260 --> 00:02:31.560 
cutting out a card and then from there
he's<00:02:29.590> basically<00:02:30.040> adding<00:02:30.580> some<00:02:30.910> type<00:02:31.090> of<00:02:31.120> I'm

00:02:31.560 --> 00:02:31.570 
he's basically adding some type of I'm

00:02:31.570 --> 00:02:34.590 
he's basically adding some type of I'm
guessing<00:02:31.960> some<00:02:32.140> type<00:02:32.320> of<00:02:32.730> I<00:02:33.730> want<00:02:34.420> to<00:02:34.450> call<00:02:34.570> it

00:02:34.590 --> 00:02:34.600 
guessing some type of I want to call it

00:02:34.600 --> 00:02:36.240 
guessing some type of I want to call it
blue<00:02:34.780> sometime<00:02:35.140> something<00:02:35.800> to<00:02:35.890> make<00:02:36.040> it<00:02:36.190> a

00:02:36.240 --> 00:02:36.250 
blue sometime something to make it a

00:02:36.250 --> 00:02:38.370 
blue sometime something to make it a
little<00:02:36.490> bit<00:02:36.730> stronger<00:02:37.090> and<00:02:37.240> able<00:02:37.750> to<00:02:37.930> hold<00:02:38.170> its

00:02:38.370 --> 00:02:38.380 
little bit stronger and able to hold its

00:02:38.380 --> 00:02:40.560 
little bit stronger and able to hold its
shape<00:02:38.440> and<00:02:38.830> then<00:02:39.190> he's<00:02:39.340> placing<00:02:39.610> it<00:02:39.910> and<00:02:40.090> then

00:02:40.560 --> 00:02:40.570 
shape and then he's placing it and then

00:02:40.570 --> 00:02:42.450 
shape and then he's placing it and then
he's<00:02:40.750> also<00:02:40.930> got<00:02:41.230> like<00:02:41.380> basically<00:02:41.950> two<00:02:42.070> copies

00:02:42.450 --> 00:02:42.460 
he's also got like basically two copies

00:02:42.460 --> 00:02:45.000 
he's also got like basically two copies
minimum<00:02:43.120> of<00:02:43.270> the<00:02:43.420> card<00:02:43.660> and<00:02:44.470> then<00:02:44.680> he's<00:02:44.830> able

00:02:45.000 --> 00:02:45.010 
minimum of the card and then he's able

00:02:45.010 --> 00:02:46.800 
minimum of the card and then he's able
to<00:02:45.220> put<00:02:45.400> it<00:02:45.460> in<00:02:45.550> there<00:02:45.670> and<00:02:45.760> it<00:02:45.850> looks<00:02:46.000> so<00:02:46.210> dang

00:02:46.800 --> 00:02:46.810

00:02:48.480 --> 00:02:48.490 
awesome look at he's making the card pop

00:02:48.490 --> 00:02:50.700 
awesome look at he's making the card pop
out<00:02:48.700> I<00:02:48.910> don't<00:02:49.330> know<00:02:49.390> what<00:02:49.570> pack<00:02:49.780> this<00:02:50.020> is<00:02:50.230> but
