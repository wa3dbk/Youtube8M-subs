00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.179
 In this video tutorial, we will look at how 

00:00:01.290 --> 00:00:05.310
 speed up the computer using normal 

00:00:03.179 --> 00:00:06.359
 readyboost flash drives 

00:00:05.310 --> 00:00:08.790
 in order to really 

00:00:06.359 --> 00:00:10.559
 feel some kind of acceleration flash drive 

00:00:08.790 --> 00:00:12.450
 must be not the oldest not the most 

00:00:10.559 --> 00:00:14.790
 bad she must have good 

00:00:12.450 --> 00:00:17.460
 read speed reading 

00:00:14.790 --> 00:00:20.010
 write to the most average in principle flash drive 

00:00:17.460 --> 00:00:22.580
 fits so began to insert the USB flash drive into 

00:00:20.010 --> 00:00:24.720
 computer and hut 

00:00:22.580 --> 00:00:27.180
 set up will happen now 

00:00:24.720 --> 00:00:29.670
 autorun with options what to do 

00:00:27.180 --> 00:00:31.340
 flash drive and there is such a last point on 

00:00:29.670 --> 00:00:33.870
 which few people pay attention 

00:00:31.340 --> 00:00:36.960
 speed up the system using 

00:00:33.870 --> 00:00:39.540
 windows readyboost this one 

00:00:36.960 --> 00:00:45.930
 item we need click on this item 

00:00:39.540 --> 00:00:47.360
 and here there are several options first 

00:00:45.930 --> 00:00:49.980
 option not to use this device 

00:00:47.360 --> 00:00:51.930
 the second option is to provide it 

00:00:49.980 --> 00:00:55.379
 readyboost device 

00:00:51.930 --> 00:00:57.960
 and 3 use this device 

00:00:55.379 --> 00:01:00.390
 but here you can manually specify 

00:00:57.960 --> 00:01:03.390
 how many place on the flash drive are we ready 

00:01:00.390 --> 00:01:05.010
 give a boost in this way 

00:01:03.390 --> 00:01:06.810
 It turns out that the flash drive can be 

00:01:05.010 --> 00:01:09.450
 regular files can be continued 

00:01:06.810 --> 00:01:11.040
 use as both drives 

00:01:09.450 --> 00:01:14.070
 information and 

00:01:11.040 --> 00:01:16.140
 some place will just be allocated under 

00:01:14.070 --> 00:01:17.520
 technology readyboost that myself at all 

00:01:16.140 --> 00:01:19.950
 represents this technology 

00:01:17.520 --> 00:01:23.189
 when you have a computer with a little 

00:01:19.950 --> 00:01:25.560
 RAM and slow 

00:01:23.189 --> 00:01:28.049
 some kind of wicked hard drive 

00:01:25.560 --> 00:01:30.299
 which may already be cracking then 

00:01:28.049 --> 00:01:32.790
 just technology readyboost allows 

00:01:30.299 --> 00:01:35.610
 use this fast flash memory 

00:01:32.790 --> 00:01:38.220
 ssd for laminating that is basically 

00:01:35.610 --> 00:01:41.040
 we can say that partially 

00:01:38.220 --> 00:01:41.579
 flash drive takes on the function of operative 

00:01:41.040 --> 00:01:43.350
 of memory 

00:01:41.579 --> 00:01:46.229
 Well, it will not be entirely correct 

00:01:43.350 --> 00:01:47.970
 but in principle, yes it turns out that the cache 

00:01:46.229 --> 00:01:50.759
 will be written and read just 

00:01:47.970 --> 00:01:52.979
 On flash memory, it will be faster than 

00:01:50.759 --> 00:01:54.630
 your old hard drive respectively 

00:01:52.979 --> 00:01:55.470
 it will speed up the work considerably 

00:01:54.630 --> 00:01:58.799
 computer 

00:01:55.470 --> 00:02:01.020
 Well, I think that there will be a gigabyte 

00:01:58.799 --> 00:02:03.119
 more than enough but if you want 

00:02:01.020 --> 00:02:06.210
 highlight more then you can highlight and 

00:02:03.119 --> 00:02:08.179
 more I will allocate there a thousand 200 megabytes 

00:02:06.210 --> 00:02:11.569
 under technology fish 

00:02:08.179 --> 00:02:14.930
 and click apply readyboost 

00:02:11.569 --> 00:02:17.150
 configures the cache set up then click 

00:02:14.930 --> 00:02:18.010
 ok now when we go to my 

00:02:17.150 --> 00:02:21.170
 computer 

00:02:18.010 --> 00:02:22.900
 Click on the right button and the stick 

00:02:21.170 --> 00:02:25.909
 go to the properties section 

00:02:22.900 --> 00:02:28.670
 here we have the readyboost tab 

00:02:25.909 --> 00:02:30.920
 and here we can always change it 

00:02:28.670 --> 00:02:33.500
 resize highlighted under this 

00:02:30.920 --> 00:02:35.719
 technology and you can always put 

00:02:33.500 --> 00:02:37.639
 tick doesn't use device for 

00:02:35.719 --> 00:02:39.590
 readyboost and when is this place again 

00:02:37.639 --> 00:02:40.760
 becomes free again, he can 

00:02:39.590 --> 00:02:42.109
 will write files 

00:02:40.760 --> 00:02:44.359
 if we choose to provide a tick 

00:02:42.109 --> 00:02:47.450
 device readyboost technology 

00:02:44.359 --> 00:02:49.849
 then the system will automatically select 

00:02:47.450 --> 00:02:52.370
 maximum and affordable place for a flash drive 

00:02:49.849 --> 00:02:54.319
 for this technology so now 

00:02:52.370 --> 00:02:56.810
 when we go to the flash drive we can 

00:02:54.319 --> 00:02:59.060
 here see the file for boost it is there 

00:02:56.810 --> 00:03:01.219
 the place that is allocated for technology 

00:02:59.060 --> 00:03:03.139
 on the flash drive you all learned how you can 

00:03:01.219 --> 00:03:05.659
 speed up old computer with 

00:03:03.139 --> 00:03:07.819
 flash drives and go to the next step 

00:03:05.659 --> 00:03:10.480
 there, too, sure clothes for myself 

00:03:07.819 --> 00:03:10.480
 something interesting
