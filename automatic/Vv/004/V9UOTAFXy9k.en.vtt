00:01:27.720 --> 00:01:29.330 
this rain off whoops that's the one and
but<00:01:28.380> the<00:01:28.470> whole<00:01:28.619> world<00:01:28.890> has<00:01:29.100> still<00:01:29.310> been

00:01:29.330 --> 00:01:29.340 
but the whole world has still been

00:01:29.340 --> 00:01:30.950 
but the whole world has still been
continuing<00:01:30.090> while<00:01:30.270> I've<00:01:30.390> been<00:01:30.420> sleeping

00:01:30.950 --> 00:01:30.960 
continuing while I've been sleeping

00:01:30.960 --> 00:01:32.539 
continuing while I've been sleeping
normally<00:01:31.439> a<00:01:31.590> Minecraft<00:01:31.950> it<00:01:32.009> would<00:01:32.100> just<00:01:32.250> stop

00:01:32.539 --> 00:01:32.549 
normally a Minecraft it would just stop

00:01:32.549 --> 00:01:34.100 
normally a Minecraft it would just stop
for<00:01:32.880> some<00:01:33.060> weird<00:01:33.299> reason<00:01:33.479> and<00:01:33.840> that's<00:01:33.990> how

00:01:34.100 --> 00:01:34.110 
for some weird reason and that's how

00:01:34.110 --> 00:01:36.109 
for some weird reason and that's how
minecraft<00:01:34.560> works<00:01:34.740> and<00:01:35.009> when<00:01:35.729> you<00:01:35.820> woke<00:01:35.939> up

00:01:36.109 --> 00:01:36.119 
minecraft works and when you woke up

00:01:36.119 --> 00:01:37.700 
minecraft works and when you woke up
everything<00:01:36.360> was<00:01:36.479> the<00:01:36.630> same<00:01:36.840> but<00:01:37.020> now<00:01:37.259> the

00:01:37.700 --> 00:01:37.710 
everything was the same but now the

00:01:37.710 --> 00:01:39.109 
everything was the same but now the
whole<00:01:37.890> world<00:01:38.130> is<00:01:38.220> actually<00:01:38.340> advanced<00:01:39.000> the

00:01:39.109 --> 00:01:39.119 
whole world is actually advanced the

00:01:39.119 --> 00:01:40.880 
whole world is actually advanced the
same<00:01:39.360> time<00:01:39.600> we<00:01:39.720> would<00:01:39.810> have<00:01:39.930> been<00:01:40.110> had<00:01:40.560> I<00:01:40.590> just

00:01:40.880 --> 00:01:40.890 
same time we would have been had I just

00:01:40.890 --> 00:01:42.530 
same time we would have been had I just
waited<00:01:41.310> out<00:01:41.430> the<00:01:41.579> night<00:01:41.759> instead<00:01:42.240> of<00:01:42.360> sleeping

00:01:42.530 --> 00:01:42.540 
waited out the night instead of sleeping

00:01:42.540 --> 00:01:44.450 
waited out the night instead of sleeping
so<00:01:43.290> yeah<00:01:43.770> over<00:01:44.159> here

00:01:44.450 --> 00:01:44.460 
so yeah over here

00:01:44.460 --> 00:01:45.950 
so yeah over here
I've<00:01:44.579> actually<00:01:44.909> set<00:01:45.240> some<00:01:45.270> things<00:01:45.689> up<00:01:45.840> to

00:01:45.950 --> 00:01:45.960 
I've actually set some things up to

00:01:45.960 --> 00:01:47.840 
I've actually set some things up to
demonstrate<00:01:46.110> this<00:01:46.470> further<00:01:46.740> 60<00:01:47.579> I've<00:01:47.700> got

00:01:47.840 --> 00:01:47.850 
demonstrate this further 60 I've got

00:01:47.850 --> 00:01:49.429 
demonstrate this further 60 I've got
buying<00:01:48.119> a<00:01:48.299> minecart<00:01:48.780> going<00:01:49.079> around<00:01:49.290> on<00:01:49.409> a

00:01:49.429 --> 00:01:49.439 
buying a minecart going around on a

00:01:49.439 --> 00:01:50.810 
buying a minecart going around on a
minecart<00:01:49.860> track<00:01:49.890> here<00:01:50.220> I've<00:01:50.430> also<00:01:50.640> got

00:01:50.810 --> 00:01:50.820 
minecart track here I've also got

00:01:50.820 --> 00:01:52.760 
minecart track here I've also got
furnace<00:01:51.270> and<00:01:51.540> also<00:01:51.869> a<00:01:51.899> dispenser<00:01:52.470> that<00:01:52.590> would

00:01:52.760 --> 00:01:52.770 
furnace and also a dispenser that would

00:01:52.770 --> 00:01:54.289 
furnace and also a dispenser that would
normally<00:01:53.040> be<00:01:53.280> hooked<00:01:53.549> up<00:01:53.700> to<00:01:53.759> this<00:01:53.939> but<00:01:54.119> it<00:01:54.210> was

00:01:54.289 --> 00:01:54.299 
normally be hooked up to this but it was

00:01:54.299 --> 00:01:55.969 
normally be hooked up to this but it was
making<00:01:54.420> a<00:01:54.600> horrible<00:01:54.780> ticking<00:01:55.229> noise<00:01:55.409> so<00:01:55.890> I've

00:01:55.969 --> 00:01:55.979 
making a horrible ticking noise so I've

00:01:55.979 --> 00:01:57.560 
making a horrible ticking noise so I've
had<00:01:56.100> to<00:01:56.130> disable<00:01:56.520> it<00:01:56.729> and<00:01:56.939> here<00:01:57.299> we've<00:01:57.420> got<00:01:57.450> a

00:01:57.560 --> 00:01:57.570 
had to disable it and here we've got a

00:01:57.570 --> 00:01:58.190 
had to disable it and here we've got a
bed<00:01:57.780> as<00:01:57.960> well

00:01:58.190 --> 00:01:58.200 
bed as well

00:01:58.200 --> 00:02:00.230 
bed as well
now<00:01:58.740> another<00:01:59.070> neat<00:01:59.369> thing<00:01:59.610> about<00:01:59.670> this<00:01:59.880> mod<00:02:00.090> is

00:02:00.230 --> 00:02:00.240 
now another neat thing about this mod is

00:02:00.240 --> 00:02:01.670 
now another neat thing about this mod is
it<00:02:00.329> enables<00:02:00.540> you<00:02:00.750> to<00:02:00.780> sleep<00:02:01.110> in<00:02:01.320> the<00:02:01.469> daytime

00:02:01.670 --> 00:02:01.680 
it enables you to sleep in the daytime

00:02:01.680 --> 00:02:03.590 
it enables you to sleep in the daytime
so<00:02:02.189> for<00:02:02.610> example<00:02:02.909> if<00:02:02.969> you<00:02:03.060> wanted<00:02:03.240> to<00:02:03.299> go<00:02:03.479> and

00:02:03.590 --> 00:02:03.600 
so for example if you wanted to go and

00:02:03.600 --> 00:02:05.899 
so for example if you wanted to go and
find<00:02:04.079> some<00:02:04.259> Enderman<00:02:04.770> and<00:02:04.950> it<00:02:05.219> was<00:02:05.340> daytime<00:02:05.700> we

00:02:05.899 --> 00:02:05.909 
find some Enderman and it was daytime we

00:02:05.909 --> 00:02:07.700 
find some Enderman and it was daytime we
wanted<00:02:06.119> to<00:02:06.479> wait<00:02:06.600> until<00:02:06.840> nighttime<00:02:07.049> you<00:02:07.590> can

00:02:07.700 --> 00:02:07.710 
wanted to wait until nighttime you can

00:02:07.710 --> 00:02:09.199 
wanted to wait until nighttime you can
have<00:02:07.799> to<00:02:07.920> sleep<00:02:08.160> in<00:02:08.310> the<00:02:08.399> day<00:02:08.550> until<00:02:09.030> the

00:02:09.199 --> 00:02:09.209 
have to sleep in the day until the

00:02:09.209 --> 00:02:11.780 
have to sleep in the day until the
nighttime<00:02:09.390> and<00:02:09.810> pretty<00:02:10.530> much<00:02:10.649> a<00:02:10.679> simulate<00:02:11.580> my

00:02:11.780 --> 00:02:11.790 
nighttime and pretty much a simulate my

00:02:11.790 --> 00:02:13.010 
nighttime and pretty much a simulate my
sleeping<00:02:12.270> fan<00:02:12.420> in<00:02:12.599> real

00:02:13.010 --> 00:02:13.020 
sleeping fan in real

00:02:13.020 --> 00:02:14.960 
sleeping fan in real
her<00:02:13.560> sleep<00:02:13.890> in<00:02:14.040> the<00:02:14.130> day<00:02:14.310> wake<00:02:14.580> up<00:02:14.730> at<00:02:14.820> night

00:02:14.960 --> 00:02:14.970 
her sleep in the day wake up at night

00:02:14.970 --> 00:02:16.730 
her sleep in the day wake up at night
now<00:02:15.450> it's<00:02:15.600> not<00:02:15.720> that<00:02:15.900> bad<00:02:16.050> but<00:02:16.290> anyway<00:02:16.500> if<00:02:16.680> I

00:02:16.730 --> 00:02:16.740 
now it's not that bad but anyway if I

00:02:16.740 --> 00:02:18.500 
now it's not that bad but anyway if I
just<00:02:16.920> go<00:02:17.070> in<00:02:17.220> bed<00:02:17.460> now<00:02:17.670> you<00:02:17.970> can<00:02:18.120> see<00:02:18.270> that<00:02:18.420> it

00:02:18.500 --> 00:02:18.510 
just go in bed now you can see that it

00:02:18.510 --> 00:02:20.450 
just go in bed now you can see that it
lets<00:02:18.720> me<00:02:18.870> go<00:02:19.020> in<00:02:19.140> bed<00:02:19.320> and<00:02:19.530> it's<00:02:19.890> advancing

00:02:20.450 --> 00:02:20.460 
lets me go in bed and it's advancing

00:02:20.460 --> 00:02:23.540 
lets me go in bed and it's advancing
time<00:02:20.700> as<00:02:20.970> if<00:02:21.270> it<00:02:21.450> was<00:02:21.570> nighttime<00:02:21.840> so<00:02:22.560> yeah<00:02:23.190> it

00:02:23.540 --> 00:02:23.550 
time as if it was nighttime so yeah it

00:02:23.550 --> 00:02:25.280 
time as if it was nighttime so yeah it
should<00:02:23.820> be<00:02:23.850> nighttime<00:02:24.120> soon<00:02:24.330> let's<00:02:24.900> just<00:02:25.110> wait

00:02:25.280 --> 00:02:25.290 
should be nighttime soon let's just wait

00:02:25.290 --> 00:02:25.910 
should be nighttime soon let's just wait
just

00:02:25.910 --> 00:02:25.920 
just

00:02:25.920 --> 00:02:27.800 
just
oh<00:02:25.950> and<00:02:26.400> by<00:02:26.520> the<00:02:26.550> way<00:02:26.700> this<00:02:26.910> simulation<00:02:27.540> speed

00:02:27.800 --> 00:02:27.810 
oh and by the way this simulation speed

00:02:27.810 --> 00:02:29.990 
oh and by the way this simulation speed
varies<00:02:28.590> depending<00:02:29.100> on<00:02:29.190> your<00:02:29.310> computer<00:02:29.520> and

00:02:29.990 --> 00:02:30.000 
varies depending on your computer and

00:02:30.000 --> 00:02:32.030 
varies depending on your computer and
processing<00:02:30.510> power<00:02:30.690> so<00:02:30.960> depending<00:02:31.860> on<00:02:31.890> how

00:02:32.030 --> 00:02:32.040 
processing power so depending on how

00:02:32.040 --> 00:02:34.040 
processing power so depending on how
powerful<00:02:32.490> your<00:02:32.610> computer<00:02:32.940> is<00:02:33.090> it<00:02:33.330> depends<00:02:33.930> how

00:02:34.040 --> 00:02:34.050 
powerful your computer is it depends how

00:02:34.050 --> 00:02:35.600 
powerful your computer is it depends how
fast<00:02:34.350> the<00:02:34.500> world<00:02:34.740> is<00:02:34.830> going<00:02:34.950> to<00:02:34.980> be<00:02:35.070> simulated

00:02:35.600 --> 00:02:35.610 
fast the world is going to be simulated

00:02:35.610 --> 00:02:38.030 
fast the world is going to be simulated
because<00:02:36.030> it<00:02:36.120> is<00:02:36.210> quite<00:02:36.510> CPU<00:02:37.260> intensive<00:02:37.500> in

00:02:38.030 --> 00:02:38.040 
because it is quite CPU intensive in

00:02:38.040 --> 00:02:39.920 
because it is quite CPU intensive in
fact<00:02:38.280> I'm<00:02:38.400> running<00:02:38.640> about<00:02:38.760> 20<00:02:39.360> FPS<00:02:39.720> at<00:02:39.870> the

00:02:39.920 --> 00:02:39.930 
fact I'm running about 20 FPS at the

00:02:39.930 --> 00:02:41.150 
fact I'm running about 20 FPS at the
moment<00:02:40.200> that's<00:02:40.530> how<00:02:40.680> bad<00:02:40.890> it<00:02:41.010> is

00:02:41.150 --> 00:02:41.160 
moment that's how bad it is

00:02:41.160 --> 00:02:44.150 
moment that's how bad it is
um<00:02:41.670> because<00:02:42.450> the<00:02:42.900> there's<00:02:43.440> so<00:02:43.590> much<00:02:43.710> going<00:02:43.980> on

00:02:44.150 --> 00:02:44.160 
um because the there's so much going on

00:02:44.160 --> 00:02:45.350 
um because the there's so much going on
I<00:02:44.220> mean<00:02:44.430> it's<00:02:44.580> having<00:02:44.760> to<00:02:44.880> render<00:02:45.090> everything

00:02:45.350 --> 00:02:45.360 
I mean it's having to render everything

00:02:45.360 --> 00:02:47.870 
I mean it's having to render everything
but<00:02:46.020> thirty<00:02:46.260> times<00:02:46.560> as<00:02:46.770> fast<00:02:46.950> which<00:02:47.280> is<00:02:47.310> not

00:02:47.870 --> 00:02:47.880 
but thirty times as fast which is not

00:02:47.880 --> 00:02:49.610 
but thirty times as fast which is not
the<00:02:48.030> easiest<00:02:48.060> thing<00:02:48.600> to<00:02:48.630> do<00:02:48.810> in<00:02:48.900> the<00:02:48.960> world<00:02:49.110> but

00:02:49.610 --> 00:02:49.620 
the easiest thing to do in the world but

00:02:49.620 --> 00:02:50.750 
the easiest thing to do in the world but
yeah<00:02:49.710> you<00:02:49.890> can<00:02:49.980> see<00:02:50.130> I've<00:02:50.220> woke<00:02:50.370> up<00:02:50.520> and<00:02:50.670> it's

00:02:50.750 --> 00:02:50.760 
yeah you can see I've woke up and it's

00:02:50.760 --> 00:02:52.190 
yeah you can see I've woke up and it's
now<00:02:50.850> nighttime<00:02:51.390> so<00:02:51.570> you<00:02:51.630> can<00:02:51.750> sleep<00:02:51.990> in<00:02:52.110> the

00:02:52.190 --> 00:02:52.200 
now nighttime so you can sleep in the

00:02:52.200 --> 00:02:54.320 
now nighttime so you can sleep in the
day<00:02:52.350> and<00:02:52.620> wait<00:02:53.040> until<00:02:53.250> night<00:02:53.460> time<00:02:53.490> but<00:02:54.240> now

00:02:54.320 --> 00:02:54.330 
day and wait until night time but now

00:02:54.330 --> 00:02:55.490 
day and wait until night time but now
I'm<00:02:54.420> going<00:02:54.540> to<00:02:54.600> show<00:02:54.750> you<00:02:54.810> what<00:02:55.200> actually

00:02:55.490 --> 00:02:55.500 
I'm going to show you what actually

00:02:55.500 --> 00:02:57.260 
I'm going to show you what actually
happens<00:02:55.800> now<00:02:55.980> let<00:02:56.250> me<00:02:56.310> just<00:02:56.460> sleep<00:02:56.670> again<00:02:56.940> you

00:02:57.260 --> 00:02:57.270 
happens now let me just sleep again you

00:02:57.270 --> 00:02:58.340 
happens now let me just sleep again you
can<00:02:57.420> see<00:02:57.540> that<00:02:57.630> the<00:02:57.690> minecart<00:02:58.080> does<00:02:58.230> some

00:02:58.340 --> 00:02:58.350 
can see that the minecart does some

00:02:58.350 --> 00:03:00.350 
can see that the minecart does some
glitchy<00:02:58.620> things<00:02:58.980> I<00:02:59.220> was<00:02:59.640> hoping<00:02:59.940> it's<00:03:00.120> been

00:03:00.350 --> 00:03:00.360 
glitchy things I was hoping it's been

00:03:00.360 --> 00:03:01.670 
glitchy things I was hoping it's been
around<00:03:00.540> it<00:03:00.660> like<00:03:00.750> thirty<00:03:01.050> times<00:03:01.290> the<00:03:01.440> speed

00:03:01.670 --> 00:03:01.680 
around it like thirty times the speed

00:03:01.680 --> 00:03:03.380 
around it like thirty times the speed
but<00:03:01.950> certainly<00:03:02.430> minecraft<00:03:02.850> can't<00:03:03.060> keep<00:03:03.210> up

00:03:03.380 --> 00:03:03.390 
but certainly minecraft can't keep up

00:03:03.390 --> 00:03:04.700 
but certainly minecraft can't keep up
with<00:03:03.420> that<00:03:03.540> speed<00:03:03.930> so<00:03:04.110> the<00:03:04.200> minecart<00:03:04.530> just

00:03:04.700 --> 00:03:04.710 
with that speed so the minecart just

00:03:04.710 --> 00:03:07.640 
with that speed so the minecart just
goes<00:03:04.890> its<00:03:05.160> usual<00:03:05.490> speed<00:03:06.080> but<00:03:07.080> over<00:03:07.260> here<00:03:07.410> to

00:03:07.640 --> 00:03:07.650 
goes its usual speed but over here to

00:03:07.650 --> 00:03:08.780 
goes its usual speed but over here to
demonstrate<00:03:08.040> it<00:03:08.130> better<00:03:08.220> I've<00:03:08.430> actually<00:03:08.550> got

00:03:08.780 --> 00:03:08.790 
demonstrate it better I've actually got

00:03:08.790 --> 00:03:10.340 
demonstrate it better I've actually got
a<00:03:08.820> furnace<00:03:09.180> and<00:03:09.450> what<00:03:09.630> I'm<00:03:09.720> gonna<00:03:09.840> do<00:03:10.050> is<00:03:10.230> going

00:03:10.340 --> 00:03:10.350 
a furnace and what I'm gonna do is going

00:03:10.350 --> 00:03:12.140 
a furnace and what I'm gonna do is going
to<00:03:10.410> put<00:03:10.560> in<00:03:10.650> some<00:03:10.770> coal<00:03:11.040> along<00:03:11.640> with<00:03:11.790> some<00:03:11.970> iron

00:03:12.140 --> 00:03:12.150 
to put in some coal along with some iron

00:03:12.150 --> 00:03:14.360 
to put in some coal along with some iron
ore<00:03:12.330> and<00:03:12.600> then<00:03:13.020> you<00:03:13.380> can<00:03:13.530> see<00:03:13.650> it's<00:03:13.770> good<00:03:14.010> smelt

00:03:14.360 --> 00:03:14.370 
ore and then you can see it's good smelt

00:03:14.370 --> 00:03:15.950 
ore and then you can see it's good smelt
at<00:03:14.490> really<00:03:14.670> boring<00:03:14.970> speed<00:03:15.390> but<00:03:15.630> if<00:03:15.750> I<00:03:15.870> actually

00:03:15.950 --> 00:03:15.960 
at really boring speed but if I actually

00:03:15.960 --> 00:03:17.780 
at really boring speed but if I actually
go<00:03:16.290> in<00:03:16.410> this<00:03:16.530> bed<00:03:16.770> now<00:03:16.980> let<00:03:17.400> me<00:03:17.490> in<00:03:17.580> the<00:03:17.640> bed

00:03:17.780 --> 00:03:17.790 
go in this bed now let me in the bed

00:03:17.790 --> 00:03:18.470 
go in this bed now let me in the bed
there<00:03:18.090> we<00:03:18.150> go

00:03:18.470 --> 00:03:18.480 
there we go

00:03:18.480 --> 00:03:20.930 
there we go
and<00:03:18.750> now<00:03:18.960> just<00:03:19.500> let's<00:03:19.920> wait<00:03:20.100> a<00:03:20.130> bit<00:03:20.250> that's<00:03:20.670> er

00:03:20.930 --> 00:03:20.940 
and now just let's wait a bit that's er

00:03:20.940 --> 00:03:22.280 
and now just let's wait a bit that's er
wait<00:03:21.360> until<00:03:21.540> it<00:03:21.600> goes<00:03:21.720> for<00:03:21.870> about<00:03:21.990> thirty

00:03:22.280 --> 00:03:22.290 
wait until it goes for about thirty

00:03:22.290 --> 00:03:24.890 
wait until it goes for about thirty
times<00:03:22.500> and<00:03:22.890> then<00:03:23.430> leave<00:03:23.640> bed<00:03:23.910> now<00:03:24.360> normally

00:03:24.890 --> 00:03:24.900 
times and then leave bed now normally

00:03:24.900 --> 00:03:26.690 
times and then leave bed now normally
yeah<00:03:25.020> you<00:03:25.080> see<00:03:25.320> only<00:03:25.860> just<00:03:26.070> about<00:03:26.220> smartweed

00:03:26.690 --> 00:03:26.700 
yeah you see only just about smartweed

00:03:26.700 --> 00:03:28.550 
yeah you see only just about smartweed
one<00:03:26.880> iron<00:03:27.180> but<00:03:27.360> now<00:03:27.540> it's<00:03:27.750> melted<00:03:28.110> sixteen

00:03:28.550 --> 00:03:28.560 
one iron but now it's melted sixteen

00:03:28.560 --> 00:03:29.960 
one iron but now it's melted sixteen
iron<00:03:28.800> and<00:03:29.100> that's<00:03:29.370> because<00:03:29.670> while<00:03:29.820> I<00:03:29.850> was

00:03:29.960 --> 00:03:29.970 
iron and that's because while I was

00:03:29.970 --> 00:03:30.680 
iron and that's because while I was
sleeping

00:03:30.680 --> 00:03:30.690 
sleeping

00:03:30.690 --> 00:03:32.330 
sleeping
the<00:03:30.990> game<00:03:31.140> was<00:03:31.320> running<00:03:31.500> at<00:03:31.590> thirty<00:03:31.830> times<00:03:32.130> the

00:03:32.330 --> 00:03:32.340 
the game was running at thirty times the

00:03:32.340 --> 00:03:33.920 
the game was running at thirty times the
speed<00:03:32.580> and<00:03:32.850> that<00:03:33.060> was<00:03:33.240> actually<00:03:33.360> affecting

00:03:33.920 --> 00:03:33.930 
speed and that was actually affecting

00:03:33.930 --> 00:03:35.570 
speed and that was actually affecting
the<00:03:34.050> furnace<00:03:34.440> so<00:03:34.920> now<00:03:35.100> you<00:03:35.160> can<00:03:35.370> see<00:03:35.460> it's

00:03:35.570 --> 00:03:35.580 
the furnace so now you can see it's

00:03:35.580 --> 00:03:37.220 
the furnace so now you can see it's
melted<00:03:35.910> loads<00:03:36.180> of<00:03:36.330> iron<00:03:36.570> in<00:03:36.690> that<00:03:36.750> small

00:03:37.220 --> 00:03:37.230 
melted loads of iron in that small

00:03:37.230 --> 00:03:38.720 
melted loads of iron in that small
amount<00:03:37.470> of<00:03:37.500> time<00:03:37.560> I<00:03:37.740> was<00:03:38.010> actually<00:03:38.100> in<00:03:38.310> bed<00:03:38.520> so

00:03:38.720 --> 00:03:38.730 
amount of time I was actually in bed so

00:03:38.730 --> 00:03:40.400 
amount of time I was actually in bed so
it's<00:03:38.850> really<00:03:39.000> useful<00:03:39.210> if<00:03:39.630> you've<00:03:39.930> got<00:03:40.050> a<00:03:40.080> vast

00:03:40.400 --> 00:03:40.410 
it's really useful if you've got a vast

00:03:40.410 --> 00:03:42.140 
it's really useful if you've got a vast
quantities<00:03:41.100> of<00:03:41.220> iron<00:03:41.400> to<00:03:41.640> smelt<00:03:41.880> you<00:03:41.970> just

00:03:42.140 --> 00:03:42.150 
quantities of iron to smelt you just

00:03:42.150 --> 00:03:43.790 
quantities of iron to smelt you just
don't<00:03:42.330> want<00:03:42.480> to<00:03:42.540> wait<00:03:42.690> around<00:03:42.870> you<00:03:43.500> can<00:03:43.650> just

00:03:43.790 --> 00:03:43.800 
don't want to wait around you can just

00:03:43.800 --> 00:03:45.620 
don't want to wait around you can just
sleep<00:03:43.980> and<00:03:44.280> it'll<00:03:44.490> progress<00:03:44.880> at<00:03:45.090> like<00:03:45.360> thirty

00:03:45.620 --> 00:03:45.630 
sleep and it'll progress at like thirty

00:03:45.630 --> 00:03:47.840 
sleep and it'll progress at like thirty
times<00:03:45.810> the<00:03:45.960> speed<00:03:46.310> depending<00:03:47.310> on<00:03:47.340> a<00:03:47.400> computer

00:03:47.840 --> 00:03:47.850 
times the speed depending on a computer

00:03:47.850 --> 00:03:49.850 
times the speed depending on a computer
of<00:03:47.970> course<00:03:48.000> and<00:03:48.420> here<00:03:49.200> you'll<00:03:49.320> just<00:03:49.350> get<00:03:49.590> loads

00:03:49.850 --> 00:03:49.860 
of course and here you'll just get loads

00:03:49.860 --> 00:03:51.590 
of course and here you'll just get loads
of<00:03:49.980> iron<00:03:50.160> really<00:03:50.460> quickly<00:03:50.940> now<00:03:51.360> another

00:03:51.590 --> 00:03:51.600 
of iron really quickly now another

00:03:51.600 --> 00:03:53.180 
of iron really quickly now another
demonstration<00:03:51.900> over<00:03:52.470> here<00:03:52.830> I've<00:03:53.010> got<00:03:53.040> a

00:03:53.180 --> 00:03:53.190 
demonstration over here I've got a

00:03:53.190 --> 00:03:55.130 
demonstration over here I've got a
dispenser<00:03:54.030> which<00:03:54.420> I'm<00:03:54.540> now<00:03:54.660> going<00:03:54.780> to<00:03:54.840> hook<00:03:54.960> up

00:03:55.130 --> 00:03:55.140 
dispenser which I'm now going to hook up

00:03:55.140 --> 00:03:57.710 
dispenser which I'm now going to hook up
to<00:03:55.350> this<00:03:55.860> repeater<00:03:56.460> and<00:03:56.730> you<00:03:57.210> can<00:03:57.330> see<00:03:57.450> we've

00:03:57.710 --> 00:03:57.720 
to this repeater and you can see we've

00:03:57.720 --> 00:03:59.660 
to this repeater and you can see we've
got<00:03:57.750> that<00:03:57.990> horrible<00:03:58.290> ER<00:03:58.530> ticking<00:03:59.490> noises

00:03:59.660 --> 00:03:59.670 
got that horrible ER ticking noises

00:03:59.670 --> 00:04:01.580 
got that horrible ER ticking noises
firing<00:04:00.270> the<00:04:00.330> arrows<00:04:00.570> but<00:04:01.200> watch<00:04:01.380> what<00:04:01.530> happens

00:04:01.580 --> 00:04:01.590 
firing the arrows but watch what happens

00:04:01.590 --> 00:04:04.070 
firing the arrows but watch what happens
when<00:04:02.010> I<00:04:02.100> go<00:04:02.220> in<00:04:02.370> bed<00:04:02.550> look<00:04:03.540> at<00:04:03.690> that

00:04:04.070 --> 00:04:04.080 
when I go in bed look at that

00:04:04.080 --> 00:04:06.350 
when I go in bed look at that
listen<00:04:04.560> to<00:04:04.710> that<00:04:04.890> look<00:04:05.550> at<00:04:05.670> the<00:04:05.760> rapid<00:04:06.150> fire

00:04:06.350 --> 00:04:06.360 
listen to that look at the rapid fire

00:04:06.360 --> 00:04:08.030 
listen to that look at the rapid fire
arrows<00:04:06.750> that's<00:04:07.230> what<00:04:07.350> I<00:04:07.410> mean<00:04:07.560> it<00:04:07.680> speeds<00:04:07.950> up

00:04:08.030 --> 00:04:08.040 
arrows that's what I mean it speeds up

00:04:08.040 --> 00:04:09.949 
arrows that's what I mean it speeds up
the<00:04:08.100> game<00:04:08.160> so<00:04:08.580> much<00:04:08.850> they<00:04:09.150> just<00:04:09.180> and<00:04:09.570> now<00:04:09.900> we

00:04:09.949 --> 00:04:09.959 
the game so much they just and now we

00:04:09.959 --> 00:04:11.630 
the game so much they just and now we
get<00:04:10.230> the<00:04:10.290> clicking<00:04:10.620> now<00:04:10.830> that<00:04:11.040> clicking<00:04:11.430> set

00:04:11.630 --> 00:04:11.640 
get the clicking now that clicking set

00:04:11.640 --> 00:04:13.100

our<00:04:11.790> light<00:04:12.030> is<00:04:12.120> so<00:04:12.300> annoying<00:04:12.540> but<00:04:12.959> yeah<00:04:13.050> you

00:04:13.100 --> 00:04:13.110 
our light is so annoying but yeah you

00:04:13.110 --> 00:04:15.050 
our light is so annoying but yeah you
can<00:04:13.290> see<00:04:13.470> it<00:04:13.650> was<00:04:13.740> firing<00:04:14.070> arrows<00:04:14.280> 30<00:04:14.640> times<00:04:14.880> as

00:04:15.050 --> 00:04:15.060 
can see it was firing arrows 30 times as

00:04:15.060 --> 00:04:16.699 
can see it was firing arrows 30 times as
fast<00:04:15.270> because<00:04:15.450> my<00:04:15.630> game<00:04:15.780> was<00:04:16.080> running<00:04:16.440> 30

00:04:16.699 --> 00:04:16.709 
fast because my game was running 30

00:04:16.709 --> 00:04:18.620 
fast because my game was running 30
times<00:04:16.980> as<00:04:17.160> fast<00:04:17.340> and<00:04:17.640> that<00:04:18.120> pretty<00:04:18.270> much<00:04:18.390> sums

00:04:18.620 --> 00:04:18.630 
times as fast and that pretty much sums

00:04:18.630 --> 00:04:20.150 
times as fast and that pretty much sums
up<00:04:18.720> everything<00:04:19.080> in<00:04:19.140> the<00:04:19.200> mod<00:04:19.320> all<00:04:19.530> it<00:04:19.799> does<00:04:19.950> is

00:04:20.150 --> 00:04:20.160 
up everything in the mod all it does is

00:04:20.160 --> 00:04:22.490 
up everything in the mod all it does is
it<00:04:20.250> adds<00:04:20.400> like<00:04:20.820> a<00:04:21.270> simulating<00:04:21.960> world<00:04:22.200> feature

00:04:22.490 --> 00:04:22.500 
it adds like a simulating world feature

00:04:22.500 --> 00:04:24.350 
it adds like a simulating world feature
when<00:04:22.979> you<00:04:23.010> sleep<00:04:23.430> so<00:04:23.880> instead<00:04:24.060> of<00:04:24.150> just

00:04:24.350 --> 00:04:24.360 
when you sleep so instead of just

00:04:24.360 --> 00:04:25.850 
when you sleep so instead of just
sleeping<00:04:24.780> and<00:04:24.900> then<00:04:24.990> just<00:04:25.229> appearing<00:04:25.650> to

00:04:25.850 --> 00:04:25.860 
sleeping and then just appearing to

00:04:25.860 --> 00:04:26.480 
sleeping and then just appearing to
daytime

00:04:26.480 --> 00:04:26.490 
daytime

00:04:26.490 --> 00:04:27.980 
daytime
it<00:04:26.580> actually<00:04:26.699> runs<00:04:27.090> the<00:04:27.270> world<00:04:27.449> at<00:04:27.599> faster

00:04:27.980 --> 00:04:27.990 
it actually runs the world at faster

00:04:27.990 --> 00:04:29.629 
it actually runs the world at faster
speed<00:04:28.229> while<00:04:28.470> you're<00:04:28.590> sleeping<00:04:29.039> so<00:04:29.400> when<00:04:29.550> you

00:04:29.629 --> 00:04:29.639 
speed while you're sleeping so when you

00:04:29.639 --> 00:04:31.430 
speed while you're sleeping so when you
wake<00:04:29.789> up<00:04:29.819> things<00:04:30.389> will<00:04:30.599> have<00:04:30.690> changed<00:04:30.720> and

00:04:31.430 --> 00:04:31.440 
wake up things will have changed and

00:04:31.440 --> 00:04:32.960 
wake up things will have changed and
it's<00:04:31.860> really<00:04:32.069> useful<00:04:32.250> if<00:04:32.520> you<00:04:32.639> want<00:04:32.699> to<00:04:32.789> smell

quarry and build craft for example and

00:04:45.569 --> 00:04:47.210 
quarry and build craft for example and
then<00:04:45.780> sleep<00:04:46.080> the<00:04:46.470> quarry<00:04:46.740> is<00:04:46.860> going<00:04:47.009> to<00:04:47.069> work
