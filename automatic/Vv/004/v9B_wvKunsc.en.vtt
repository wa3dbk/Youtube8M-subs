00:00:33.480 --> 00:00:35.140
 humanitarian and students 

00:00:35.140 --> 00:00:36.500
 it's something that 

00:00:36.500 --> 00:00:39.600
 seen from the outside looks to be really great that apparently 

00:00:39.600 --> 00:00:41.399
 according to the testimonies 

00:00:41.399 --> 00:00:43.880
 who wants from the inside is even better 

00:00:43.880 --> 00:00:45.220
 we thought why not us 

00:00:45.220 --> 00:00:47.540
 we are young we start if you want 

00:00:47.540 --> 00:00:50.540
 and here we did not talk about that we did not think more than that in the end 

00:00:51.480 --> 00:00:54.550
 luckily because it makes us the job that we had thought 

00:00:55.100 --> 00:00:59.059
 we may have no more weight we are still launched a ceasefire 

00:00:59.059 --> 00:01:02.059
 launched so that these phones is really the year 

00:01:02.580 --> 00:01:05.120
 we do not break in the known recognition 

00:01:05.120 --> 00:01:06.670
 we try to do 

00:01:06.670 --> 00:01:09.910
 the same day of the ball it will be a bit like that it's really there 

00:01:09.909 --> 00:01:11.860
 exemption 

00:01:11.860 --> 00:01:13.580
 next February 17 

00:01:13.580 --> 00:01:17.350
 Hundreds of students piloted 4l for 10 days 

00:01:17.350 --> 00:01:19.450
 and 6000 kilometers of adventure 

00:01:19.450 --> 00:01:23.080
 and upon arrival it will be almost 80 tons of supplies that will be 

00:01:23.080 --> 00:01:24.420

00:01:29.009 --> 00:01:29.920

00:01:29.920 --> 00:01:33.730
 a lot of things on rebound that the generously offered by the sound system 

00:01:33.729 --> 00:01:35.870
 euros the entourage of adrien 

00:01:35.870 --> 00:01:38.780
 I usually ask is because these speeds with schools of 

00:01:38.780 --> 00:01:40.860
 medicine down medical equipment 

00:01:40.860 --> 00:01:43.580
 e all that is awesome usually lead solar panels 

00:01:43.580 --> 00:01:46.439
 things like that good it smells them like little we can 

00:01:46.439 --> 00:01:49.410
 but it is true that we were lucky not to participate 

00:01:49.410 --> 00:01:51.999
 like not an operation with a primary school on the 

00:01:51.999 --> 00:01:55.649
 the overweight says which allowed us to restore that the tea quite a lot of 

00:01:55.649 --> 00:01:57.420
 school and sports supplies 

00:01:57.420 --> 00:02:00.770
 so that's the way we got it, it gave us a big boost 

00:02:01.280 --> 00:02:05.350
 we also have a lot of sports equipment so basketball shoes 

00:02:05.350 --> 00:02:08.579
 and in my opinion my honor to what will require level 

00:02:08.579 --> 00:02:10.279
 humanitarian material 

00:02:10.279 --> 00:02:13.739
 this project is supported by around fifteen partners throughout the 

00:02:13.739 --> 00:02:15.069
 valley 

00:02:15.069 --> 00:02:17.319
 and what led me to be a partner in this operation 

00:02:17.319 --> 00:02:19.909
 well it's the approach of these young people 

00:02:19.909 --> 00:02:25.629
 for his first mamba an approach jimani land a more than the 4l trophy and 

00:02:25.629 --> 00:02:28.129
 if and for children 

00:02:28.129 --> 00:02:31.609
 in euros a little bit disadvantaged at the difficulty level of schools 

00:02:31.609 --> 00:02:35.180
 Moroccans and for the gift that their approach interested me also for them 

00:02:35.180 --> 00:02:38.509

00:02:50.279 --> 00:02:52.629
 Moroccan schools 

00:02:52.629 --> 00:02:55.390

00:02:58.330 --> 00:03:01.739
