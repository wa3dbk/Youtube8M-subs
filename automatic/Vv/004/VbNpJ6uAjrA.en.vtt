Roth<00:02:34.890> IRA<00:02:35.340> fee<00:02:35.610> well<00:02:36.540> but<00:02:37.490> thousands<00:02:38.490> of

00:02:38.660 --> 00:02:38.670 
Roth IRA fee well but thousands of

Roth IRA fee well but thousands of
prints<00:02:39.150> that<00:02:39.360> I<00:02:39.930> tear<00:02:40.470> and<00:02:41.370> glue<00:02:41.900> to<00:02:42.900> these

00:02:43.270 --> 00:02:43.280 
prints that I tear and glue to these

00:02:43.280 --> 00:02:45.920 
prints that I tear and glue to these
board<00:02:44.280> under<00:02:44.640> here<00:02:44.850> that's<00:02:45.090> like<00:02:45.210> an<00:02:45.360> archival

00:02:45.920 --> 00:02:45.930 
board under here that's like an archival

00:02:45.930 --> 00:02:50.800 
board under here that's like an archival
cardboard<00:02:46.440> so<00:02:47.130> they're<00:02:47.340> all<00:02:47.490> glued<00:02:48.060> together

00:02:50.800 --> 00:02:50.810 

00:02:50.810 --> 00:02:53.000 

so<00:02:51.810> they<00:02:51.930> have<00:02:52.020> this<00:02:52.140> kind<00:02:52.470> of<00:02:52.530> seamless

00:02:53.000 --> 00:02:53.010 
so they have this kind of seamless

00:02:53.010 --> 00:02:54.530 
so they have this kind of seamless
quality<00:02:53.640> and<00:02:53.850> yet<00:02:54.030> they're<00:02:54.240> kind<00:02:54.450> of

00:02:54.530 --> 00:02:54.540 
quality and yet they're kind of

00:02:54.540 --> 00:02:56.570 
quality and yet they're kind of
fractured<00:02:55.110> and<00:02:55.230> distorted<00:02:55.860> and<00:02:56.160> then<00:02:56.490> the

00:02:56.570 --> 00:02:56.580 
fractured and distorted and then the

00:02:56.580 --> 00:02:58.850 
fractured and distorted and then the
whole<00:02:56.730> thing<00:02:56.760> is<00:02:57.090> covered<00:02:57.270> with<00:02:57.420> beeswax<00:02:57.990> well

00:02:58.850 --> 00:02:58.860 
whole thing is covered with beeswax well

00:02:58.860 --> 00:02:59.720 
whole thing is covered with beeswax well
so<00:02:59.010> they<00:02:59.130> smell<00:02:59.400> good

00:02:59.720 --> 00:02:59.730 
so they smell good

00:02:59.730 --> 00:03:01.640

00:03:01.640 --> 00:03:01.650 
yeah how long does it take to uh to

00:03:01.650 --> 00:03:08.450 
yeah how long does it take to uh to
create<00:03:01.890> a<00:03:01.920> piece<00:03:02.100> like<00:03:02.250> this<00:03:06.110> six<00:03:07.110> weeks<00:03:07.460> seven
