you're<00:01:31.259> gonna<00:01:31.320> turn<00:01:31.650> it<00:01:31.909> let's<00:01:32.909> see<00:01:33.090> all<00:01:33.299> the

00:01:33.440 --> 00:01:33.450 
you're gonna turn it let's see all the

00:01:33.450 --> 00:01:35.600 
you're gonna turn it let's see all the
way<00:01:33.540> around<00:01:33.900> that's<00:01:34.409> a<00:01:34.619> half<00:01:34.860> a<00:01:35.009> turn<00:01:35.250> and

00:01:35.600 --> 00:01:35.610 
way around that's a half a turn and

00:01:35.610 --> 00:01:38.929 
way around that's a half a turn and
that's<00:01:36.509> a<00:01:36.720> full<00:01:36.960> turn<00:01:37.259> approximately<00:01:38.130> if<00:01:38.790> you

00:01:38.929 --> 00:01:38.939 
that's a full turn approximately if you

00:01:38.939 --> 00:01:40.850 
that's a full turn approximately if you
probably<00:01:39.270> do<00:01:39.390> it<00:01:39.509> about<00:01:39.659> one<00:01:39.930> full<00:01:40.229> turn<00:01:40.470> let's

00:01:40.850 --> 00:01:40.860 
probably do it about one full turn let's

00:01:40.860 --> 00:01:44.120 
probably do it about one full turn let's
do<00:01:40.979> another<00:01:41.130> two<00:01:41.909> full<00:01:42.180> turns<00:01:42.680> two<00:01:43.680> full<00:01:43.920> turns

00:01:44.120 --> 00:01:44.130 
do another two full turns two full turns

00:01:44.130 --> 00:01:45.469 
do another two full turns two full turns
you're<00:01:44.399> good<00:01:44.579> so<00:01:44.759> you<00:01:44.850> want<00:01:45.000> to<00:01:45.090> make<00:01:45.210> sure<00:01:45.240> you

00:01:45.469 --> 00:01:45.479 
you're good so you want to make sure you

00:01:45.479 --> 00:01:47.810 
you're good so you want to make sure you
have<00:01:45.659> pressure<00:01:46.049> off<00:01:46.380> this<00:01:47.220> because<00:01:47.610> this<00:01:47.759> is

00:01:47.810 --> 00:01:47.820 
have pressure off this because this is

00:01:47.820 --> 00:01:50.899 
have pressure off this because this is
what's<00:01:48.090> going<00:01:48.240> to<00:01:48.329> lower<00:01:48.630> the<00:01:49.350> press<00:01:49.920> and<00:01:50.310> once

00:01:50.899 --> 00:01:50.909 
what's going to lower the press and once

00:01:50.909 --> 00:01:53.300 
what's going to lower the press and once
you<00:01:51.060> have<00:01:51.270> two<00:01:51.960> full<00:01:52.229> turns<00:01:52.560> on<00:01:52.799> that<00:01:52.860> then

00:01:53.300 --> 00:01:53.310 
you have two full turns on that then

00:01:53.310 --> 00:01:55.069 
you have two full turns on that then
you're<00:01:53.520> gonna<00:01:53.640> go<00:01:54.270> ahead<00:01:54.479> and<00:01:54.659> go<00:01:54.750> up<00:01:54.780> to<00:01:54.990> the

00:01:55.069 --> 00:01:55.079 
you're gonna go ahead and go up to the

00:01:55.079 --> 00:01:57.859 
you're gonna go ahead and go up to the
top<00:01:55.320> and<00:01:55.619> see<00:01:56.340> if<00:01:56.399> this<00:01:56.610> press<00:01:57.000> plate<00:01:57.360> that<00:01:57.659> is

00:02:00.649 --> 00:02:00.659 
stuck up against the top has any wiggle

00:02:00.659 --> 00:02:02.719 
stuck up against the top has any wiggle
room<00:02:00.689> so<00:02:01.140> in<00:02:01.649> the<00:02:01.740> case<00:02:02.009> here<00:02:02.399> I'm<00:02:02.579> actually

what<00:03:05.210> you're<00:03:05.630> gonna<00:03:05.750> do<00:03:06.110> in<00:03:06.410> this<00:03:06.560> situation

00:03:06.790 --> 00:03:06.800 
what you're gonna do in this situation

00:03:06.800 --> 00:03:08.140 
what you're gonna do in this situation
is<00:03:07.310> you're<00:03:07.430> gonna<00:03:07.490> once<00:03:07.790> again

00:03:08.140 --> 00:03:08.150 
is you're gonna once again

00:03:08.150 --> 00:03:10.210 
is you're gonna once again
take<00:03:08.360> this<00:03:08.540> thumb<00:03:08.870> screw<00:03:09.070> turn<00:03:10.070> it

00:03:10.210 --> 00:03:10.220 
take this thumb screw turn it

00:03:10.220 --> 00:03:12.430 
take this thumb screw turn it
counterclockwise<00:03:10.910> so<00:03:11.660> righty<00:03:11.960> tighty<00:03:12.260> lefty

00:03:12.430 --> 00:03:12.440 
counterclockwise so righty tighty lefty

00:03:12.440 --> 00:03:13.930 
counterclockwise so righty tighty lefty
loosey<00:03:13.070> so<00:03:13.190> you're<00:03:13.310> going<00:03:13.430> to<00:03:13.460> turn<00:03:13.610> it<00:03:13.730> left

00:03:13.930 --> 00:03:13.940 
loosey so you're going to turn it left

00:03:13.940 --> 00:03:15.850 
loosey so you're going to turn it left
two<00:03:14.450> full<00:03:14.750> rotations<00:03:15.350> there's<00:03:15.590> a<00:03:15.680> half

00:03:15.850 --> 00:03:15.860 
two full rotations there's a half

00:03:15.860 --> 00:03:18.730 
two full rotations there's a half
rotation<00:03:16.430> one<00:03:17.210> rotation<00:03:17.870> one<00:03:18.440> and<00:03:18.560> a<00:03:18.590> half

00:03:18.730 --> 00:03:18.740 
rotation one rotation one and a half

00:03:18.740 --> 00:03:21.670 
rotation one rotation one and a half
rotations<00:03:19.370> and<00:03:19.550> two<00:03:20.210> rotations<00:03:20.840> once<00:03:21.380> you<00:03:21.500> got

00:03:21.670 --> 00:03:21.680 
rotations and two rotations once you got

00:03:21.680 --> 00:03:23.440 
rotations and two rotations once you got
it<00:03:21.800> at<00:03:21.890> two<00:03:22.040> rotations<00:03:22.610> you're<00:03:23.060> then<00:03:23.270> gonna

00:03:23.440 --> 00:03:23.450 
it at two rotations you're then gonna

00:03:23.450 --> 00:03:26.800 
it at two rotations you're then gonna
take<00:03:23.570> basically<00:03:24.290> a<00:03:24.320> eight<00:03:24.830> millimeter<00:03:25.810> nut

00:03:26.800 --> 00:03:26.810 
take basically a eight millimeter nut

00:03:26.810 --> 00:03:28.870 
take basically a eight millimeter nut
driver<00:03:27.170> I<00:03:27.500> think<00:03:27.800> that<00:03:28.100> also<00:03:28.220> equates<00:03:28.730> to

00:03:28.870 --> 00:03:28.880 
driver I think that also equates to

00:03:28.880 --> 00:03:31.600 
driver I think that also equates to
about<00:03:29.060> a<00:03:29.180> 5/16<00:03:30.170> nut<00:03:30.350> driver<00:03:30.380> and<00:03:30.890> you're<00:03:31.490> going

00:03:31.600 --> 00:03:31.610 
about a 5/16 nut driver and you're going

00:03:31.610 --> 00:03:33.460 
about a 5/16 nut driver and you're going
to<00:03:31.640> unscrew<00:03:32.030> these<00:03:32.300> two<00:03:32.630> little<00:03:32.900> nuts<00:03:33.140> on<00:03:33.260> the

00:03:33.460 --> 00:03:33.470 
to unscrew these two little nuts on the

00:03:33.470 --> 00:03:36.910 
to unscrew these two little nuts on the
top<00:03:33.500> and<00:03:33.920> they<00:03:34.040> press<00:03:35.500> don't<00:03:36.500> lose<00:03:36.680> any<00:03:36.860> of

00:03:36.910 --> 00:03:36.920 
top and they press don't lose any of

00:03:36.920 --> 00:03:38.350 
top and they press don't lose any of
these<00:03:37.040> pieces<00:03:37.280> you're<00:03:37.640> gonna<00:03:37.730> find<00:03:38.090> that<00:03:38.300> a

00:03:38.350 --> 00:03:38.360 
these pieces you're gonna find that a

00:03:38.360 --> 00:03:41.140 
these pieces you're gonna find that a
screw<00:03:38.750> comes<00:03:38.990> off<00:03:39.230> with<00:03:39.890> a<00:03:40.130> nut<00:03:40.670> at<00:03:40.820> the<00:03:40.940> top

00:03:41.140 --> 00:03:41.150 
screw comes off with a nut at the top

00:03:41.150 --> 00:03:44.820 
screw comes off with a nut at the top
and<00:03:41.420> also<00:03:41.570> a<00:03:41.720> washer

00:03:44.820 --> 00:03:44.830 

00:03:44.830 --> 00:03:48.270 

let's<00:03:45.490> unscrew<00:03:45.940> the<00:03:46.060> second<00:03:46.420> one<00:03:46.540> here<00:03:47.280> once

00:03:48.270 --> 00:03:48.280 
let's unscrew the second one here once

00:03:48.280 --> 00:03:50.640 
let's unscrew the second one here once
again<00:03:48.370> a<00:03:48.580> nut<00:03:48.970> and<00:03:49.210> a<00:03:49.540> washer<00:03:49.750> and<00:03:50.230> the<00:03:50.380> screw

00:03:50.640 --> 00:03:50.650 
again a nut and a washer and the screw

00:03:50.650 --> 00:03:52.650 
again a nut and a washer and the screw
comes<00:03:50.890> out<00:03:51.130> and<00:03:51.310> the<00:03:51.880> screw<00:03:52.090> will<00:03:52.240> come<00:03:52.420> out<00:03:52.540> of

00:03:52.650 --> 00:03:52.660 
comes out and the screw will come out of

00:03:52.660 --> 00:03:54.630 
comes out and the screw will come out of
the<00:03:52.720> bottom<00:03:53.020> side<00:03:53.200> here<00:03:53.260> then<00:03:54.160> the<00:03:54.310> next<00:03:54.550> thing

00:03:54.630 --> 00:03:54.640 
the bottom side here then the next thing

00:03:54.640 --> 00:03:55.950 
the bottom side here then the next thing
you're<00:03:54.730> gonna<00:03:54.850> do<00:03:55.060> is<00:03:55.090> just<00:03:55.390> take<00:03:55.570> your<00:03:55.750> hand

and very carefully push this piece out

00:03:58.330 --> 00:04:00.930 
and very carefully push this piece out
now<00:03:59.230> once<00:03:59.440> you<00:03:59.590> push<00:03:59.860> this<00:04:00.100> piece<00:04:00.340> out<00:04:00.520> this<00:04:00.790> is

00:04:00.930 --> 00:04:00.940 
now once you push this piece out this is

00:04:00.940 --> 00:04:02.790 
now once you push this piece out this is
the<00:04:01.060> whole<00:04:01.210> press<00:04:01.540> apparatus<00:04:02.260> then<00:04:02.710> you're

00:04:02.790 --> 00:04:02.800 
the whole press apparatus then you're

00:04:02.800 --> 00:04:04.380 
the whole press apparatus then you're
going<00:04:02.890> to<00:04:02.980> take<00:04:03.160> the<00:04:03.310> other<00:04:03.340> hand<00:04:03.880> or<00:04:04.030> take<00:04:04.210> two

00:04:08.790 --> 00:04:08.800 
down it should come out without any

00:04:08.800 --> 00:04:10.680 
down it should come out without any
resistance<00:04:09.160> and<00:04:09.610> then<00:04:10.060> once<00:04:10.270> again<00:04:10.540> you're

00:04:10.680 --> 00:04:10.690 
resistance and then once again you're

00:04:10.690 --> 00:04:12.600 
resistance and then once again you're
going<00:04:10.780> to<00:04:10.840> have<00:04:10.960> to<00:04:11.050> put<00:04:11.260> this<00:04:11.410> part<00:04:12.190> back<00:04:12.370> in

00:04:12.600 --> 00:04:12.610 
going to have to put this part back in

00:04:12.610 --> 00:04:15.360 
going to have to put this part back in
so<00:04:13.180> line<00:04:13.420> it<00:04:13.450> up<00:04:13.690> once<00:04:14.440> again<00:04:14.740> like<00:04:14.980> you<00:04:15.130> took

00:04:15.360 --> 00:04:15.370 
so line it up once again like you took

00:04:15.370 --> 00:04:17.940 
so line it up once again like you took
it<00:04:15.460> apart<00:04:15.760> put<00:04:16.360> your<00:04:16.540> screw<00:04:17.140> in<00:04:17.350> from

00:04:17.940 --> 00:04:17.950 
it apart put your screw in from

00:04:17.950 --> 00:04:23.370 
it apart put your screw in from
underneath<00:04:21.150> put<00:04:22.150> it<00:04:22.240> through<00:04:22.360> the<00:04:22.450> top<00:04:22.690> put

00:04:23.370 --> 00:04:23.380 
underneath put it through the top put

00:04:23.380 --> 00:04:26.750 
underneath put it through the top put
the<00:04:23.410> washer<00:04:23.950> on<00:04:24.130> and<00:04:24.400> then<00:04:24.520> put<00:04:24.730> your<00:04:24.850> nut<00:04:25.090> on

00:04:26.750 --> 00:04:26.760 
the washer on and then put your nut on

00:04:26.760 --> 00:04:29.130 
the washer on and then put your nut on
then<00:04:27.760> once<00:04:28.000> again<00:04:28.120> you're<00:04:28.630> going<00:04:28.720> to<00:04:28.780> line<00:04:28.990> up

00:04:29.130 --> 00:04:29.140 
then once again you're going to line up

00:04:29.140 --> 00:04:30.810 
then once again you're going to line up
the<00:04:29.260> hole<00:04:29.710> on<00:04:29.920> the<00:04:30.010> other<00:04:30.070> side<00:04:30.400> and<00:04:30.700> do<00:04:30.790> the

00:04:30.810 --> 00:04:30.820 
the hole on the other side and do the

00:04:30.820 --> 00:04:37.530 
the hole on the other side and do the
same<00:04:30.940> exact<00:04:31.480> thing<00:04:36.270> then<00:04:37.270> you're<00:04:37.390> going<00:04:37.480> to

00:04:37.530 --> 00:04:37.540 
same exact thing then you're going to

00:04:37.540 --> 00:04:40.440 
same exact thing then you're going to
take<00:04:37.720> your<00:04:38.280> nut<00:04:39.280> driver<00:04:39.460> once<00:04:39.910> again<00:04:40.210> and

00:04:40.440 --> 00:04:40.450 
take your nut driver once again and

00:04:40.450 --> 00:04:47.720 
take your nut driver once again and
tighten<00:04:40.900> it<00:04:41.050> up<00:04:41.200> until<00:04:42.040> it's<00:04:42.190> nice<00:04:42.790> and<00:04:43.030> tight

00:04:47.720 --> 00:04:47.730 

00:04:47.730 --> 00:04:50.640 

so<00:04:48.730> that's<00:04:48.970> how<00:04:49.210> you<00:04:49.300> unjam<00:04:49.990> a<00:04:50.230> Welles<00:04:50.470> press

00:04:50.640 --> 00:04:50.650 
so that's how you unjam a Welles press

00:04:50.650 --> 00:04:53.040 
so that's how you unjam a Welles press
if<00:04:51.130> it<00:04:51.280> is<00:04:51.400> stuck<00:04:51.790> in<00:04:52.000> the<00:04:52.180> up<00:04:52.360> position<00:04:52.390> once

00:04:53.040 --> 00:04:53.050 
if it is stuck in the up position once

00:04:53.050 --> 00:04:56.159 
if it is stuck in the up position once
again<00:04:53.169> you<00:04:53.890> know<00:04:54.040> it<00:04:54.190> it<00:04:54.910> may<00:04:55.210> ship<00:04:55.600> in<00:04:55.810> its<00:04:55.960> up

00:04:56.159 --> 00:04:56.169 
again you know it it may ship in its up

00:04:56.169 --> 00:04:58.500 
again you know it it may ship in its up
position<00:04:56.620> by<00:04:57.310> accident<00:04:57.940> but<00:04:58.090> most<00:04:58.360> of<00:04:58.450> the

00:04:58.500 --> 00:04:58.510 
position by accident but most of the

00:04:58.510 --> 00:04:59.550 
position by accident but most of the
time<00:04:58.660> they<00:04:58.780> ship<00:04:58.990> it<00:04:59.110> in<00:04:59.200> the<00:04:59.260> down<00:04:59.440> position

00:04:59.550 --> 00:04:59.560 
time they ship it in the down position

00:04:59.560 --> 00:05:00.900 
time they ship it in the down position
because<00:05:00.010> they<00:05:00.130> don't<00:05:00.280> want<00:05:00.430> that<00:05:00.490> happening

00:05:00.900 --> 00:05:00.910

why<00:05:13.150> this<00:05:13.660> unit<00:05:14.080> was<00:05:14.200> actually<00:05:14.530> originally

00:05:14.850 --> 00:05:14.860 
why this unit was actually originally

00:05:14.860 --> 00:05:16.500 
why this unit was actually originally
stuck<00:05:15.100> was<00:05:15.250> because<00:05:15.520> I<00:05:15.550> took<00:05:15.669> this<00:05:15.940> to<00:05:16.150> a<00:05:16.180> show

00:05:16.500 --> 00:05:16.510 
stuck was because I took this to a show

00:05:16.510 --> 00:05:19.140 
stuck was because I took this to a show
and<00:05:16.840> it<00:05:17.560> was<00:05:17.680> out<00:05:17.800> on<00:05:17.950> a<00:05:17.980> demonstration<00:05:18.340> table

00:05:19.140 --> 00:05:19.150 
and it was out on a demonstration table

00:05:19.150 --> 00:05:21.060 
and it was out on a demonstration table
and<00:05:19.510> some<00:05:19.960> of<00:05:20.020> the<00:05:20.080> actors<00:05:20.350> she<00:05:20.530> jacked<00:05:20.860> this

00:05:21.060 --> 00:05:21.070 
and some of the actors she jacked this

00:05:21.070 --> 00:05:23.280 
and some of the actors she jacked this
up<00:05:21.280> when<00:05:21.520> I<00:05:21.550> wasn't<00:05:21.820> looking<00:05:22.270> and<00:05:22.480> it<00:05:23.020> was<00:05:23.110> just

00:05:23.280 --> 00:05:23.290 
up when I wasn't looking and it was just

00:05:23.290 --> 00:05:25.409 
up when I wasn't looking and it was just
stuck<00:05:23.530> in<00:05:23.560> the<00:05:23.770> up<00:05:23.919> position<00:05:23.950> and<00:05:24.460> then<00:05:25.390> I

00:05:25.409 --> 00:05:25.419 
stuck in the up position and then I

00:05:25.419 --> 00:05:27.300 
stuck in the up position and then I
tried<00:05:25.810> to<00:05:25.930> turn<00:05:26.110> it<00:05:26.290> you<00:05:26.680> know<00:05:26.800> just<00:05:27.190> to<00:05:27.250> have

00:05:27.300 --> 00:05:27.310 
tried to turn it you know just to have

00:05:27.310 --> 00:05:29.250 
tried to turn it you know just to have
it<00:05:27.460> come<00:05:27.669> down<00:05:27.910> and<00:05:28.240> it<00:05:28.810> wouldn't<00:05:29.080> come<00:05:29.230> down

00:05:29.250 --> 00:05:29.260 
it come down and it wouldn't come down

00:05:29.260 --> 00:05:31.470 
it come down and it wouldn't come down
so<00:05:29.680> I<00:05:29.710> have<00:05:29.890> to<00:05:30.010> actually<00:05:30.100> had<00:05:30.340> to<00:05:30.460> do<00:05:30.610> one<00:05:31.390> of

00:05:31.470 --> 00:05:31.480 
so I have to actually had to do one of

00:05:31.480 --> 00:05:33.000 
so I have to actually had to do one of
the<00:05:31.540> two<00:05:31.720> methods<00:05:31.900> that<00:05:32.320> I<00:05:32.500> just<00:05:32.800> showed<00:05:32.980> you

00:05:33.000 --> 00:05:33.010 
the two methods that I just showed you

00:05:33.010 --> 00:05:34.470 
the two methods that I just showed you
actually<00:05:33.460> I<00:05:33.520> was<00:05:33.700> okay<00:05:34.030> with<00:05:34.210> the<00:05:34.300> first

00:05:34.470 --> 00:05:34.480 
actually I was okay with the first

00:05:34.480 --> 00:05:36.960 
actually I was okay with the first
method<00:05:34.750> but<00:05:35.590> you<00:05:35.710> you<00:05:36.250> might<00:05:36.430> have<00:05:36.640> to<00:05:36.730> do<00:05:36.880> the

00:05:36.960 --> 00:05:36.970 
method but you you might have to do the

00:05:36.970 --> 00:05:38.430 
method but you you might have to do the
second<00:05:37.330> method<00:05:37.450> which<00:05:37.690> is<00:05:37.870> the<00:05:37.990> surefire

00:05:38.430 --> 00:05:38.440 
second method which is the surefire

00:05:38.440 --> 00:05:40.980 
second method which is the surefire
method<00:05:38.680> to<00:05:39.340> get<00:05:39.490> your<00:05:39.580> Welles<00:05:40.030> press<00:05:40.180> unstuck

00:05:40.980 --> 00:05:40.990 
method to get your Welles press unstuck

00:05:40.990 --> 00:05:42.750 
method to get your Welles press unstuck
so<00:05:41.260> once<00:05:41.470> again<00:05:41.590> when<00:05:41.800> you<00:05:41.830> are<00:05:41.919> using<00:05:42.280> a<00:05:42.490> press

00:05:42.750 --> 00:05:42.760 
so once again when you are using a press

00:05:42.760 --> 00:05:45.270 
so once again when you are using a press
or<00:05:43.000> a<00:05:43.060> new<00:05:43.360> juicer<00:05:43.810> or<00:05:43.990> new<00:05:44.290> kitchen<00:05:44.770> appliance

00:05:45.270 --> 00:05:45.280 
or a new juicer or new kitchen appliance

00:05:45.280 --> 00:05:47.400 
or a new juicer or new kitchen appliance
like<00:05:45.430> a<00:05:45.490> blender<00:05:45.970> or<00:05:46.000> food<00:05:46.390> dehydrator<00:05:47.230> you

00:05:47.400 --> 00:05:47.410 
like a blender or food dehydrator you

00:05:47.410 --> 00:05:49.350 
like a blender or food dehydrator you
know<00:05:47.740> it's<00:05:47.950> a<00:05:48.070> learning<00:05:48.340> curve<00:05:48.700> just<00:05:48.760> like<00:05:49.120> the

00:05:49.350 --> 00:05:49.360 
know it's a learning curve just like the

00:05:49.360 --> 00:05:51.630 
know it's a learning curve just like the
first<00:05:49.600> time<00:05:49.780> you<00:05:49.990> got<00:05:50.169> on<00:05:50.470> a<00:05:50.800> bicycle<00:05:50.980> to<00:05:51.520> ride

00:05:53.640 --> 00:05:53.650 
a bicycle down the street you might have

00:05:53.650 --> 00:05:55.409 
a bicycle down the street you might have
fell<00:05:53.830> off<00:05:53.860> the<00:05:54.190> first<00:05:54.430> time<00:05:54.700> and<00:05:55.090> you<00:05:55.210> have<00:05:55.330> to

00:05:55.409 --> 00:05:55.419 
fell off the first time and you have to

00:05:55.419 --> 00:05:57.390 
fell off the first time and you have to
get<00:05:55.630> back<00:05:55.780> on<00:05:56.050> and<00:05:56.350> try<00:05:56.560> again<00:05:56.860> and<00:05:57.010> be

00:06:19.059 --> 00:06:19.069 
press successfully you'll be getting all

00:06:19.069 --> 00:06:20.860 
press successfully you'll be getting all
the<00:06:19.400> pulp<00:06:19.639> out<00:06:19.849> of<00:06:19.939> the<00:06:20.150> juice<00:06:20.360> making<00:06:20.780> a

00:06:20.860 --> 00:06:20.870 
the pulp out of the juice making a

00:06:20.870 --> 00:06:23.619 
the pulp out of the juice making a
high-quality<00:06:21.110> juice<00:06:21.710> with<00:06:22.310> no<00:06:22.610> fiber<00:06:23.150> in<00:06:23.300> it

00:06:23.619 --> 00:06:23.629 
high-quality juice with no fiber in it

00:06:23.629 --> 00:06:25.420 
high-quality juice with no fiber in it
and<00:06:23.810> I<00:06:23.900> mean<00:06:24.050> so<00:06:24.259> it's<00:06:24.409> worth<00:06:24.620> learning<00:06:25.099> how<00:06:25.400> to

00:06:25.420 --> 00:06:25.430 
and I mean so it's worth learning how to
