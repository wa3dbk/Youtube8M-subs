silver and then also the big brush to

00:00:32.790 --> 00:00:34.639 
silver and then also the big brush to
begin<00:00:33.030> with<00:00:33.180> I<00:00:33.360> thought<00:00:33.510> if<00:00:34.200> you<00:00:34.410> want<00:00:34.560> to

00:00:34.639 --> 00:00:34.649 
begin with I thought if you want to

00:00:34.649 --> 00:00:37.880 
begin with I thought if you want to
start<00:00:34.829> working<00:00:35.070> with<00:00:36.440> depends<00:00:37.440> we<00:00:37.620> have<00:00:37.859> a

00:00:37.880 --> 00:00:37.890 
start working with depends we have a

00:00:37.890 --> 00:00:41.799 
start working with depends we have a
couple<00:00:38.370> sets<00:00:38.550> here<00:00:38.879> that<00:00:39.809> you<00:00:40.019> can<00:00:40.260> use

00:00:41.799 --> 00:00:41.809 
couple sets here that you can use

00:00:41.809 --> 00:00:44.270 
couple sets here that you can use
alright<00:00:42.809> so<00:00:42.989> in<00:00:43.260> working<00:00:43.440> on<00:00:43.710> that<00:00:43.890> if<00:00:44.129> you

00:00:44.270 --> 00:00:44.280 
alright so in working on that if you

00:00:44.280 --> 00:00:46.580 
alright so in working on that if you
know<00:00:44.370> in<00:00:44.789> filling<00:00:45.149> out<00:00:45.239> larger<00:00:45.690> areas<00:00:46.230> like

00:00:46.580 --> 00:00:46.590 
know in filling out larger areas like

00:00:46.590 --> 00:00:48.860 
know in filling out larger areas like
that<00:00:46.890> it<00:00:47.609> takes<00:00:47.850> a<00:00:47.940> little<00:00:48.059> more<00:00:48.210> strokes<00:00:48.629> to

00:00:48.860 --> 00:00:48.870 
that it takes a little more strokes to

00:00:48.870 --> 00:00:52.700 
that it takes a little more strokes to
use<00:00:49.079> this<00:00:49.500> pen<00:00:49.800> but<00:00:50.870> if<00:00:51.870> I<00:00:52.170> were<00:00:52.350> to<00:00:52.500> use<00:00:52.530> a

00:00:52.700 --> 00:00:52.710 
use this pen but if I were to use a

00:00:52.710 --> 00:00:56.419 
use this pen but if I were to use a
larger<00:00:53.309> pen<00:00:53.870> then<00:00:54.870> I<00:00:55.170> can<00:00:55.320> fill<00:00:55.559> in<00:00:55.739> larger

00:00:56.419 --> 00:00:56.429 
larger pen then I can fill in larger

00:00:56.429 --> 00:00:58.910 
larger pen then I can fill in larger
areas<00:00:57.059> more<00:00:57.870> quickly<00:00:57.929> and<00:00:58.499> you<00:00:58.559> can<00:00:58.710> also

00:00:58.910 --> 00:00:58.920 
areas more quickly and you can also

00:00:58.920 --> 00:01:01.970 
areas more quickly and you can also
build<00:00:59.219> up<00:00:59.429> a<00:00:59.730> more<00:01:00.239> even<00:01:00.629> tone<00:01:00.899> but<00:01:01.530> while<00:01:01.800> it's

00:01:01.970 --> 00:01:01.980 
build up a more even tone but while it's

00:01:01.980 --> 00:01:05.329 
build up a more even tone but while it's
still<00:01:02.190> kind<00:01:02.399> of<00:01:02.429> fresh<00:01:02.609> on<00:01:02.969> the<00:01:03.059> paper<00:01:04.190> you<00:01:05.190> can

00:01:05.329 --> 00:01:05.339 
still kind of fresh on the paper you can

00:01:05.339 --> 00:01:07.399 
still kind of fresh on the paper you can
take<00:01:05.519> a<00:01:05.550> brush<00:01:05.850> with<00:01:06.420> some<00:01:06.570> water<00:01:06.810> and<00:01:07.140> you<00:01:07.170> can

00:01:07.399 --> 00:01:07.409 
take a brush with some water and you can

00:01:07.409 --> 00:01:09.800 
take a brush with some water and you can
start<00:01:07.620> getting<00:01:07.680> some<00:01:07.920> blends<00:01:08.370> and<00:01:08.690> then<00:01:09.690> to

00:01:09.800 --> 00:01:09.810 
start getting some blends and then to

00:01:09.810 --> 00:01:11.600 
start getting some blends and then to
kind<00:01:09.960> of<00:01:10.110> come<00:01:10.230> back<00:01:10.260> with<00:01:10.740> the<00:01:10.950> fixed<00:01:11.220> marker

00:01:11.600 --> 00:01:11.610 
kind of come back with the fixed marker

00:01:11.610 --> 00:01:15.300 
kind of come back with the fixed marker
especially<00:01:12.300> with<00:01:12.480> the<00:01:12.630> extra<00:01:13.130> sharp

00:01:15.300 --> 00:01:15.310 
especially with the extra sharp

00:01:15.310 --> 00:01:18.719 
especially with the extra sharp
you<00:01:15.820> can<00:01:15.970> then<00:01:16.119> put<00:01:16.360> additional<00:01:17.020> detail<00:01:17.729> in

00:01:18.719 --> 00:01:18.729 
you can then put additional detail in

00:01:18.729 --> 00:01:22.200 
you can then put additional detail in
some<00:01:19.119> additional<00:01:19.960> cross<00:01:20.200> hatching<00:01:20.759> in<00:01:21.759> there

00:01:22.200 --> 00:01:22.210 
some additional cross hatching in there

00:01:22.210 --> 00:01:24.749 
some additional cross hatching in there
so<00:01:22.390> you<00:01:22.450> have<00:01:22.659> a<00:01:22.689> nice<00:01:23.070> wide<00:01:24.070> range<00:01:24.430> between

00:01:24.749 --> 00:01:24.759 
so you have a nice wide range between

00:01:24.759 --> 00:01:28.050 
so you have a nice wide range between
the<00:01:24.970> scale<00:01:25.329> of<00:01:25.659> the<00:01:26.110> extra<00:01:26.649> superfine<00:01:27.640> point

00:01:28.050 --> 00:01:28.060 
the scale of the extra superfine point

00:01:28.060 --> 00:01:30.300 
the scale of the extra superfine point
and<00:01:28.329> then<00:01:28.990> the<00:01:29.259> thickness<00:01:29.619> and<00:01:29.740> the<00:01:29.829> quality

00:01:30.300 --> 00:01:30.310 
and then the thickness and the quality

00:01:30.310 --> 00:01:33.480 
and then the thickness and the quality
of<00:01:30.700> stroke<00:01:31.180> that<00:01:31.450> you<00:01:31.509> can<00:01:31.750> get<00:01:31.899> with<00:01:32.490> the

00:01:33.480 --> 00:01:33.490 
of stroke that you can get with the

00:01:33.490 --> 00:01:37.289 
of stroke that you can get with the
brush<00:01:34.090> pimp<00:01:34.390> so<00:01:35.289> if<00:01:35.619> I<00:01:35.799> want<00:01:36.039> to<00:01:36.130> draw<00:01:37.000> this

00:01:37.289 --> 00:01:37.299 
brush pimp so if I want to draw this

00:01:37.299 --> 00:01:40.319 
brush pimp so if I want to draw this
this<00:01:38.049> line<00:01:38.350> I<00:01:38.679> can<00:01:38.950> roll<00:01:39.130> it<00:01:39.250> on<00:01:39.460> the<00:01:39.490> side<00:01:39.880> and

00:01:40.319 --> 00:01:40.329 
this line I can roll it on the side and

00:01:40.329 --> 00:01:42.630 
this line I can roll it on the side and
get<00:01:40.450> a<00:01:40.509> thick<00:01:40.750> line<00:01:40.990> and<00:01:41.470> then<00:01:41.740> as<00:01:41.979> I<00:01:42.250> come<00:01:42.460> on

00:01:42.630 --> 00:01:42.640 
get a thick line and then as I come on

00:01:42.640 --> 00:01:44.700 
get a thick line and then as I come on
down<00:01:42.880> and<00:01:43.210> follow<00:01:43.659> through<00:01:44.020> that<00:01:44.140> line<00:01:44.350> I<00:01:44.380> can

00:01:44.700 --> 00:01:44.710 
down and follow through that line I can

00:01:44.710 --> 00:01:48.749 
down and follow through that line I can
taper<00:01:45.450> so<00:01:46.450> I<00:01:46.509> can<00:01:46.689> control<00:01:47.079> very<00:01:48.069> nicely<00:01:48.369> on<00:01:48.729> a

00:01:48.749 --> 00:01:48.759 
taper so I can control very nicely on a

00:01:48.759 --> 00:01:51.510 
taper so I can control very nicely on a
large<00:01:49.060> scale<00:01:49.450> for<00:01:50.380> laying<00:01:50.530> out<00:01:50.709> a<00:01:50.770> canvas

00:01:51.510 --> 00:01:51.520 
large scale for laying out a canvas

00:01:51.520 --> 00:01:54.660 
large scale for laying out a canvas
rather<00:01:52.450> than<00:01:52.690> use<00:01:52.869> a<00:01:53.170> charcoal<00:01:53.799> or<00:01:54.100> a<00:01:54.130> graphite

00:01:54.660 --> 00:01:54.670 
rather than use a charcoal or a graphite

00:01:54.670 --> 00:01:56.969 
rather than use a charcoal or a graphite
that<00:01:54.729> has<00:01:55.330> to<00:01:55.479> be<00:01:55.600> fixed<00:01:55.990> to<00:01:56.140> the<00:01:56.289> surface<00:01:56.740> once

00:01:56.969 --> 00:01:56.979 
that has to be fixed to the surface once

00:01:56.979 --> 00:01:58.529 
that has to be fixed to the surface once
these<00:01:57.220> dry<00:01:57.580> on<00:01:57.700> the<00:01:57.789> canvas<00:01:58.149> you<00:01:58.240> don't<00:01:58.420> have

00:01:58.529 --> 00:01:58.539 
these dry on the canvas you don't have

00:01:58.539 --> 00:02:00.120 
these dry on the canvas you don't have
to<00:01:58.659> worry<00:01:58.810> about<00:01:58.929> them<00:01:59.200> mixing<00:01:59.619> with<00:01:59.860> your

00:02:00.120 --> 00:02:00.130 
to worry about them mixing with your

00:02:00.130 --> 00:02:02.490 
to worry about them mixing with your
paint<00:02:00.819> if<00:02:01.030> you<00:02:01.119> want<00:02:01.299> to<00:02:01.360> do<00:02:01.450> a<00:02:01.479> drawing<00:02:02.259> with

00:02:02.490 --> 00:02:02.500 
paint if you want to do a drawing with

00:02:02.500 --> 00:02:05.760 
paint if you want to do a drawing with
these<00:02:02.679> pens<00:02:03.659> then<00:02:04.659> you<00:02:05.020> can<00:02:05.170> be<00:02:05.289> very<00:02:05.319> sketchy

00:02:05.760 --> 00:02:05.770 
these pens then you can be very sketchy

00:02:05.770 --> 00:02:08.279 
these pens then you can be very sketchy
with<00:02:06.099> it<00:02:06.280> and<00:02:06.520> I<00:02:06.580> can<00:02:06.610> see<00:02:06.970> how<00:02:07.390> these<00:02:07.659> would<00:02:08.080> be

00:02:08.279 --> 00:02:08.289 
with it and I can see how these would be

00:02:08.289 --> 00:02:10.800 
with it and I can see how these would be
very<00:02:08.769> nice<00:02:09.009> to<00:02:09.039> use<00:02:09.519> in<00:02:09.849> a<00:02:09.940> life<00:02:10.119> drawing<00:02:10.420> class

00:02:10.800 --> 00:02:10.810 
very nice to use in a life drawing class

00:02:10.810 --> 00:02:12.839 
very nice to use in a life drawing class
we're<00:02:11.200> working<00:02:11.650> on<00:02:11.769> larger<00:02:12.160> pads<00:02:12.430> of<00:02:12.640> paper

00:02:12.839 --> 00:02:12.849 
we're working on larger pads of paper

00:02:12.849 --> 00:02:14.940 
we're working on larger pads of paper
and<00:02:13.330> he<00:02:13.480> wants<00:02:13.750> a<00:02:13.840> nice<00:02:13.989> sketch<00:02:14.290> marks<00:02:14.739> and

00:02:14.940 --> 00:02:14.950 
and he wants a nice sketch marks and

and he wants a nice sketch marks and
filling<00:02:15.250> in<00:02:15.370> tones<00:02:15.640> it's<00:02:16.239> very<00:02:16.480> easy<00:02:16.780> with<00:02:17.019> a

00:02:17.039 --> 00:02:17.049

00:02:17.049 --> 00:02:18.930 
filling in tones it's very easy with a
light<00:02:17.290> touch<00:02:17.319> to<00:02:17.980> get<00:02:18.130> a<00:02:18.310> lot<00:02:18.549> of<00:02:18.670> things

00:02:18.930 --> 00:02:18.940 
light touch to get a lot of things

00:02:18.940 --> 00:02:23.009 
light touch to get a lot of things
blocked<00:02:19.930> in<00:02:20.200> in<00:02:20.739> a<00:02:20.829> very<00:02:21.010> sketchy<00:02:21.310> way<00:02:21.810> but<00:02:22.810> you

00:02:23.009 --> 00:02:23.019 
blocked in in a very sketchy way but you

00:02:23.019 --> 00:02:25.830 
blocked in in a very sketchy way but you
can<00:02:23.170> then<00:02:23.380> once<00:02:23.799> you<00:02:23.950> have<00:02:24.160> your<00:02:24.400> base<00:02:24.700> of<00:02:24.910> the

00:02:25.830 --> 00:02:25.840 
can then once you have your base of the

00:02:25.840 --> 00:02:27.360 
can then once you have your base of the
paint<00:02:26.079> down<00:02:26.290> they<00:02:26.500> can<00:02:26.650> come<00:02:26.829> back<00:02:27.010> with<00:02:27.220> some

00:02:27.360 --> 00:02:27.370 
paint down they can come back with some

00:02:27.370 --> 00:02:31.309 
paint down they can come back with some
of<00:02:27.430> these<00:02:28.290> pens

00:02:31.309 --> 00:02:31.319 

00:02:31.319 --> 00:02:33.830 

and<00:02:31.739> you<00:02:31.830> can<00:02:32.010> add<00:02:32.159> some<00:02:32.430> more<00:02:32.459> color<00:02:33.390> you<00:02:33.510> can

00:02:33.830 --> 00:02:33.840 
and you can add some more color you can

00:02:33.840 --> 00:02:36.319 
and you can add some more color you can
get<00:02:33.989> in<00:02:34.110> there<00:02:34.230> very<00:02:34.760> tightly<00:02:35.760> and<00:02:36.000> the

00:02:36.319 --> 00:02:36.329 
get in there very tightly and the

00:02:36.329 --> 00:02:39.229 
get in there very tightly and the
corners<00:02:36.810> maybe<00:02:37.650> a<00:02:38.099> little<00:02:38.579> more<00:02:38.700> fluid<00:02:39.209> than

00:02:39.229 --> 00:02:39.239 
corners maybe a little more fluid than

00:02:39.239 --> 00:02:42.830 
corners maybe a little more fluid than
you<00:02:39.840> might<00:02:40.019> with<00:02:40.260> a<00:02:40.290> brush<00:02:41.480> but<00:02:42.480> I<00:02:42.540> think<00:02:42.750> the

00:02:42.830 --> 00:02:42.840 
you might with a brush but I think the

00:02:42.840 --> 00:02:45.440 
you might with a brush but I think the
fact<00:02:43.110> that<00:02:43.200> it's<00:02:43.439> archival<00:02:44.099> quality<00:02:45.000> of

00:02:45.440 --> 00:02:45.450 
fact that it's archival quality of

00:02:45.450 --> 00:02:49.309 
fact that it's archival quality of
pigment<00:02:46.140> within<00:02:46.560> the<00:02:46.739> brushes<00:02:47.129> and<00:02:47.930> its<00:02:48.930> color

00:02:49.309 --> 00:02:49.319 
pigment within the brushes and its color

00:02:49.319 --> 00:02:52.220 
pigment within the brushes and its color
index<00:02:49.769> with<00:02:50.099> other<00:02:50.840> products<00:02:51.840> that<00:02:51.870> you<00:02:52.079> can

00:02:52.220 --> 00:02:52.230 
index with other products that you can

00:02:52.230 --> 00:02:54.920 
index with other products that you can
use<00:02:52.379> as<00:02:52.709> a<00:02:52.739> mixed-media<00:02:53.430> thing<00:02:53.849> a<00:02:54.540> little

00:02:54.920 --> 00:02:54.930 
use as a mixed-media thing a little

00:02:54.930 --> 00:02:59.030 
use as a mixed-media thing a little
positive<00:02:56.390> base<00:02:57.390> to<00:02:57.840> then<00:02:58.200> experiment<00:02:58.709> in<00:02:58.859> so

00:02:59.030 --> 00:02:59.040 
positive base to then experiment in so

00:02:59.040 --> 00:03:00.319 
positive base to then experiment in so
many<00:02:59.129> different<00:02:59.310> ways<00:02:59.489> because<00:02:59.879> you're

00:03:00.319 --> 00:03:00.329 
many different ways because you're

00:03:00.329 --> 00:03:02.170 
many different ways because you're
working<00:03:00.510> with<00:03:00.659> good<00:03:00.870> materials<00:03:01.319> and

00:03:02.170 --> 00:03:02.180 
working with good materials and

00:03:02.180 --> 00:03:05.119 
working with good materials and
experiment<00:03:03.180> with<00:03:03.239> good<00:03:03.390> materials<00:03:03.840> and<00:03:04.129> now

00:03:05.119 --> 00:03:05.129 
experiment with good materials and now

00:03:05.129 --> 00:03:13.680 
experiment with good materials and now
they<00:03:05.250> get<00:03:05.340> good<00:03:05.519> results

00:03:13.680 --> 00:03:13.690
