just<00:06:13.460> simply<00:06:13.729> too<00:06:14.060> small<00:06:14.510> but<00:06:15.080> it<00:06:15.229> also<00:06:15.410> looks

00:06:15.820 --> 00:06:15.830 
just simply too small but it also looks

00:06:15.830 --> 00:06:18.339 
just simply too small but it also looks
like<00:06:15.919> they're<00:06:16.310> on<00:06:16.550> sky<00:06:17.300> lofts<00:06:17.570> so<00:06:17.810> skyloft

00:06:22.540 --> 00:06:22.550 
might be a stage in here which will be

00:06:22.550 --> 00:06:25.560 
might be a stage in here which will be
pretty<00:06:23.210> awesome<00:06:23.449> and<00:06:23.960> it<00:06:24.470> also<00:06:24.650> looks<00:06:25.070> like

00:06:25.560 --> 00:06:25.570 
pretty awesome and it also looks like

00:06:25.570 --> 00:06:31.420 
pretty awesome and it also looks like
there's<00:06:26.570> going<00:06:26.960> to<00:06:27.199> be<00:06:27.229> maybe<00:06:28.190> far<00:06:28.970> on<00:06:30.430> forest

00:06:31.420 --> 00:06:31.430 
there's going to be maybe far on forest

00:06:31.430 --> 00:06:34.469 
there's going to be maybe far on forest
I<00:06:31.699> really<00:06:32.479> can't<00:06:32.750> think<00:06:32.990> of<00:06:33.200> the<00:06:33.349> names<00:06:33.560> of<00:06:33.860> the

00:06:34.469 --> 00:06:34.479 
I really can't think of the names of the

00:06:34.479 --> 00:06:36.879 
I really can't think of the names of the
locations<00:06:35.479> in<00:06:35.630> Skyward<00:06:36.050> Sword<00:06:36.080> right<00:06:36.590> now

00:06:36.879 --> 00:06:36.889 
locations in Skyward Sword right now

00:06:36.889 --> 00:06:39.159 
locations in Skyward Sword right now
but<00:06:37.550> it<00:06:37.819> looks<00:06:38.389> like<00:06:38.569> we're<00:06:38.749> getting<00:06:38.840> some

00:06:39.159 --> 00:06:39.169 
but it looks like we're getting some

00:06:39.169 --> 00:06:41.290 
but it looks like we're getting some
locations<00:06:39.830> from<00:06:40.129> Skyward<00:06:40.520> Sword<00:06:40.580> nonetheless

00:06:41.290 --> 00:06:41.300 
locations from Skyward Sword nonetheless

00:06:41.300 --> 00:06:43.570 
locations from Skyward Sword nonetheless
so<00:06:42.289> that's<00:06:42.590> really<00:06:42.800> that's<00:06:43.400> really

00:06:43.570 --> 00:06:43.580 
so that's really that's really

00:06:43.580 --> 00:06:45.670 
so that's really that's really
interesting<00:06:43.879> and<00:06:44.300> that's<00:06:44.509> really<00:06:44.840> cool<00:06:45.110> to<00:06:45.409> in

00:06:45.670 --> 00:06:45.680 
interesting and that's really cool to in

00:06:45.680 --> 00:06:49.239 
interesting and that's really cool to in
itself<00:06:46.009> so<00:06:46.969> I<00:06:47.270> really<00:06:47.840> have<00:06:48.050> not<00:06:48.439> much<00:06:48.740> to<00:06:48.979> say

00:06:49.239 --> 00:06:49.249 
itself so I really have not much to say

00:06:49.249 --> 00:06:52.989 
itself so I really have not much to say

00:06:52.989 --> 00:06:52.999 
because this image is so small and we

00:06:52.999 --> 00:06:58.209 
because this image is so small and we
really<00:06:53.419> can't<00:06:53.810> identify<00:06:54.340> much<00:06:55.340> so<00:06:56.180> yeah<00:06:57.219> I'm

00:06:58.209 --> 00:06:58.219
