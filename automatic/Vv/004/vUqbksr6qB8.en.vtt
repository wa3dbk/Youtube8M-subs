00:00:31.289 --> 00:00:34.739
 on tv radio of life just now 

00:00:33.480 --> 00:00:39.000
 we did not cut so they are suddenly 

00:00:34.739 --> 00:00:41.550
 well we had a little surprise at 

00:00:39.000 --> 00:00:42.839
 thank you very much this link for your goodness so 

00:00:41.550 --> 00:00:49.440
 we will talk to each other we will 

00:00:42.839 --> 00:00:50.220
 share on time and on the end the 

00:00:49.440 --> 00:00:53.159
 end of all things 

00:00:50.220 --> 00:00:54.869
 so these are the events that take place 

00:00:53.159 --> 00:00:58.769
 currently in the world on the 

00:00:54.869 --> 00:01:00.239
 geopolitics and especially about the state 

00:00:58.769 --> 00:01:02.100
 also our churches have so in 

00:01:00.239 --> 00:01:03.659
 done let's talk about the time of the 

00:01:02.100 --> 00:01:05.820
 time in which we are why 

00:01:03.659 --> 00:01:10.259
 because do you figure that since 

00:01:05.820 --> 00:01:12.930
 a few weeks the Lord put me 

00:01:10.259 --> 00:01:18.630
 to heart is not it to share on the 

00:01:12.930 --> 00:01:21.299
 time and this morning precisely is not there 

00:01:18.630 --> 00:01:24.329
 I slept I had a vision in 

00:01:21.299 --> 00:01:27.299
 which I saw myself in a place of 

00:01:24.329 --> 00:01:29.429
 there were full full of clock 

00:01:27.299 --> 00:01:30.929
 I was surrounded by a clock 

00:01:29.429 --> 00:01:35.130
 Complaints of watches everywhere 

00:01:30.929 --> 00:01:38.819
 everywhere and I was attracted as attracted 

00:01:35.130 --> 00:01:42.299
 by a huge clock is the 

00:01:38.819 --> 00:01:47.009
 clocks and then I was watching is this 

00:01:42.299 --> 00:01:52.289
 no and I was staring at that clock I saw 

00:01:47.009 --> 00:01:54.229
 was not it midnight less 

00:01:52.289 --> 00:01:57.229
 five 

00:01:54.229 --> 00:01:57.229
 11:55 p.m. 

00:02:02.630 --> 00:02:06.900
 the end of the world is approaching a group of 

00:02:05.220 --> 00:02:08.940
 scientists including twenty awards 

00:02:06.900 --> 00:02:10.020
 nobel just advanced two minutes the 

00:02:08.940 --> 00:02:12.180
 pendulum of the apocalypse 

00:02:10.020 --> 00:02:15.390
 it is now 23:55 before the 

00:02:12.180 --> 00:02:17.040
 last judgment we are at the threshold 

00:02:15.390 --> 00:02:19.020
 a second nuclear internship and a 

00:02:17.040 --> 00:02:21.660
 period of climate change without 

00:02:19.020 --> 00:02:23.459
 previous as a scientist we 

00:02:21.660 --> 00:02:24.000
 have the responsibility to inform the 

00:02:23.459 --> 00:02:25.950
 public 

00:02:24.000 --> 00:02:31.920
 and warn leaders about 

00:02:25.950 --> 00:02:35.510
 perils threatening humanity and 

00:02:31.920 --> 00:02:41.780
 then the eil is not it turned 

00:02:35.510 --> 00:02:41.780
 and she stopped at 23:57 

00:03:25.310 --> 00:03:33.900
 and afterwards I saw some lights 

00:03:30.109 --> 00:03:38.040
 from heaven and angels who 

00:03:33.900 --> 00:03:40.170
 came down from heaven on earth and from a 

00:03:38.040 --> 00:03:43.939
 single shot I saw our lord jesus 

00:03:40.170 --> 00:03:49.400
 christ fraser december it was the return 

00:03:43.939 --> 00:03:49.400
 choices of Jesus Christ of Nazareth 

00:03:59.220 --> 00:04:07.430
 and when I saw all this I went 

00:04:02.140 --> 00:04:10.159
 woke up and in my heart 

00:04:07.430 --> 00:04:13.219
 I clearly heard you have to talk about 

00:04:10.159 --> 00:04:16.810
 time in which you are time 

00:04:13.219 --> 00:04:21.229
 because the knowledge of time 

00:04:16.810 --> 00:04:24.020
 escapes many Christians very little 

00:04:21.229 --> 00:04:26.449
 of Christians very few churches speak 

00:04:24.020 --> 00:04:29.860
 on the time in which we evolve 

00:04:26.449 --> 00:04:29.860
 in which we are
