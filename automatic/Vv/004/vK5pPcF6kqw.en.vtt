about six months ago and partially is a

00:00:16.949 --> 00:00:19.099 
about six months ago and partially is a
test<00:00:17.279> see<00:00:17.670> how<00:00:17.760> shots<00:00:18.240> would<00:00:18.480> work<00:00:18.690> but<00:00:18.960> also

00:00:19.099 --> 00:00:19.109 
test see how shots would work but also

00:00:19.109 --> 00:00:21.849 
test see how shots would work but also
to<00:00:19.380> see<00:00:19.650> how<00:00:19.890> it<00:00:20.039> would<00:00:20.220> live<00:00:20.580> over<00:00:21.000> time<00:00:21.270> and

00:00:21.849 --> 00:00:21.859 
to see how it would live over time and

00:00:21.859 --> 00:00:24.609 
to see how it would live over time and
having<00:00:22.859> a<00:00:22.949> cat<00:00:23.189> jumping<00:00:23.220> around<00:00:23.760> the<00:00:24.029> table

the collection of dust on the table and
some<00:00:27.869> other<00:00:28.019> factors<00:00:28.590> means<00:00:29.279> it<00:00:29.550> isn't<00:00:29.820> the

00:00:30.169 --> 00:00:30.179 
some other factors means it isn't the

followed by blue followed by orange but

00:01:20.070 --> 00:01:22.190 
followed by blue followed by orange but
you<00:01:20.189> can<00:01:20.369> do<00:01:20.490> it<00:01:20.520> as<00:01:20.790> long<00:01:20.820> as<00:01:21.180> it's<00:01:21.360> any<00:01:21.600> single

color and it has an even light space
going<00:01:25.590> across<00:01:25.950> it<00:01:26.310> so<00:01:26.549> you<00:01:26.670> can<00:01:26.820> see<00:01:27.000> up<00:01:27.119> at<00:01:27.270> the

spots<00:01:29.420> there's<00:01:30.420> some<00:01:30.540> shadows<00:01:31.020> so<00:01:31.320> those

00:01:31.460 --> 00:01:31.470 
spots there's some shadows so those

00:01:31.470 --> 00:01:34.190 
spots there's some shadows so those
aren't<00:01:31.710> really<00:01:32.009> good<00:01:32.220> but<00:01:32.729> just<00:01:33.720> about<00:01:33.869> in<00:01:34.110> the

aren't really good but just about in the
middle<00:01:34.500> there<00:01:34.710> you<00:01:34.950> can<00:01:35.130> see<00:01:35.159> that<00:01:35.549> it's

00:01:35.690 --> 00:01:35.700 
middle there you can see that it's

00:01:35.700 --> 00:01:38.330 
middle there you can see that it's
fairly<00:01:36.290> consistent<00:01:37.290> overall<00:01:37.799> there's<00:01:38.159> some

00:01:38.330 --> 00:01:38.340 
fairly consistent overall there's some

00:01:38.340 --> 00:01:40.069 
fairly consistent overall there's some
shadow<00:01:38.610> here<00:01:39.030> for<00:01:39.270> which<00:01:39.390> I<00:01:39.570> have<00:01:39.600> a<00:01:39.780> light

that's<00:01:40.350> not<00:01:40.470> turned<00:01:40.829> on<00:01:41.009> right<00:01:41.280> now<00:01:42.890> hope

00:01:43.990 --> 00:01:44.000 
that's not turned on right now hope

that's not turned on right now hope
computers<00:01:45.000> talking<00:01:45.240> to<00:01:45.540> me<00:01:45.890> so<00:01:47.420> you<00:01:48.420> can<00:01:48.600> see

00:01:48.740 --> 00:01:48.750 
computers talking to me so you can see

00:01:48.750 --> 00:01:51.679 
computers talking to me so you can see
on<00:01:48.869> the<00:01:48.990> walls<00:01:49.140> that<00:01:49.759> there's<00:01:50.759> definitely<00:01:51.270> a

00:01:51.679 --> 00:01:51.689 
on the walls that there's definitely a

00:01:51.689 --> 00:01:56.859 
on the walls that there's definitely a
lot<00:01:52.560> of<00:01:52.770> panel<00:01:53.189> lines<00:01:53.399> now<00:01:54.149> essentially<00:01:55.009> in

00:01:56.859 --> 00:01:56.869 
lot of panel lines now essentially in

00:01:56.869 --> 00:01:59.569 
lot of panel lines now essentially in
the<00:01:57.869> real<00:01:58.259> movies<00:01:58.740> when<00:01:58.950> they're<00:01:59.100> doing<00:01:59.280> this

00:01:59.569 --> 00:01:59.579 
the real movies when they're doing this

00:01:59.579 --> 00:02:02.920 
the real movies when they're doing this
they<00:01:59.850> have<00:01:59.880> huge<00:02:00.570> sheet<00:02:00.990> of<00:02:01.409> fabric<00:02:01.950> which<00:02:02.430> are

00:02:02.920 --> 00:02:02.930 
they have huge sheet of fabric which are

00:02:02.930 --> 00:02:07.429 
they have huge sheet of fabric which are
40<00:02:03.930> x<00:02:04.079> 200<00:02:04.740> feet<00:02:04.979> long<00:02:05.420> so<00:02:06.420> they<00:02:06.810> also<00:02:07.110> have

00:02:07.429 --> 00:02:07.439 
40 x 200 feet long so they also have

00:02:07.439 --> 00:02:10.010 
40 x 200 feet long so they also have
these<00:02:07.619> panel<00:02:08.069> lines<00:02:08.250> they<00:02:08.700> have<00:02:08.970> tape<00:02:09.450> cutting

00:02:10.010 --> 00:02:10.020 
these panel lines they have tape cutting

00:02:10.020 --> 00:02:10.350 
these panel lines they have tape cutting
down

00:02:10.350 --> 00:02:10.360 
down

00:02:10.360 --> 00:02:12.630 
down
and<00:02:10.750> that's<00:02:11.590> part<00:02:11.890> of<00:02:11.920> the<00:02:12.010> process<00:02:12.220> of

00:02:12.630 --> 00:02:12.640 
and that's part of the process of
