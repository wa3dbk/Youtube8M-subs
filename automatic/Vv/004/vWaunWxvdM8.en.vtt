00:00:50.360 --> 00:00:50.370 
plant my lettuce close together and that

00:00:50.370 --> 00:00:52.309 
plant my lettuce close together and that
way<00:00:50.579> I<00:00:50.609> can<00:00:50.909> continue<00:00:51.389> to<00:00:51.629> harvest<00:00:51.870> it<00:00:52.139> all

00:00:52.309 --> 00:00:52.319 
way I can continue to harvest it all

00:00:52.319 --> 00:00:55.360 
way I can continue to harvest it all
season<00:00:52.620> and<00:00:53.309> I<00:00:53.429> can<00:00:53.609> just<00:00:53.819> cut<00:00:54.149> the<00:00:54.569> outside

00:00:55.360 --> 00:00:55.370 
season and I can just cut the outside

00:00:55.370 --> 00:00:59.000 
season and I can just cut the outside
leaves<00:00:57.049> so<00:00:58.049> I'm<00:00:58.109> cutting<00:00:58.350> these<00:00:58.589> outside

00:00:59.000 --> 00:00:59.010 
leaves so I'm cutting these outside

00:00:59.010 --> 00:01:02.569 
leaves so I'm cutting these outside
leaves<00:00:59.690> just<00:01:00.690> like<00:01:00.929> that<00:01:01.139> and<00:01:01.440> that<00:01:01.469> way<00:01:02.219> I<00:01:02.249> can

00:01:02.569 --> 00:01:02.579 
leaves just like that and that way I can

00:01:02.579 --> 00:01:05.060 
leaves just like that and that way I can
make<00:01:02.609> a<00:01:02.789> beautiful<00:01:03.239> salad<00:01:03.780> each<00:01:04.470> and<00:01:04.799> every

00:01:05.060 --> 00:01:05.070 
make a beautiful salad each and every

00:01:05.070 --> 00:01:08.330 
make a beautiful salad each and every
day<00:01:05.690> the<00:01:06.690> other<00:01:06.840> option<00:01:07.350> if<00:01:07.470> you<00:01:07.590> prefer<00:01:08.040> is

00:01:08.330 --> 00:01:08.340 
day the other option if you prefer is

00:01:08.340 --> 00:01:13.270 
day the other option if you prefer is
you<00:01:08.880> could<00:01:09.390> allow<00:01:10.170> the<00:01:11.130> leaves<00:01:11.490> to<00:01:11.759> grow<00:01:12.000> and

00:01:13.270 --> 00:01:13.280 
you could allow the leaves to grow and

00:01:13.280 --> 00:01:15.859 
you could allow the leaves to grow and
actually<00:01:14.280> for<00:01:14.490> it<00:01:14.520> to<00:01:14.670> form<00:01:14.880> a<00:01:15.060> full<00:01:15.270> head<00:01:15.570> and

00:01:15.859 --> 00:01:15.869 
actually for it to form a full head and

00:01:15.869 --> 00:01:18.410 
actually for it to form a full head and
if<00:01:16.229> you<00:01:16.380> wish<00:01:16.619> to<00:01:16.860> do<00:01:17.039> that<00:01:17.070> as<00:01:17.579> some<00:01:18.180> of<00:01:18.299> these

00:01:18.410 --> 00:01:18.420 
if you wish to do that as some of these

00:01:18.420 --> 00:01:20.840 
if you wish to do that as some of these
are<00:01:18.659> larger<00:01:19.140> over<00:01:19.469> there<00:01:19.710> you<00:01:20.250> would<00:01:20.490> want<00:01:20.759> to

00:01:20.840 --> 00:01:20.850 
are larger over there you would want to

00:01:20.850 --> 00:01:22.520 
are larger over there you would want to
plant<00:01:21.210> your<00:01:21.390> lettuces<00:01:21.840> a<00:01:21.899> little<00:01:22.259> further

00:01:22.520 --> 00:01:22.530 
plant your lettuces a little further

00:01:22.530 --> 00:01:24.770 
plant your lettuces a little further
apart<00:01:22.770> so<00:01:23.549> that<00:01:23.729> they<00:01:23.850> would<00:01:24.000> be<00:01:24.149> able<00:01:24.299> to<00:01:24.479> grow

00:01:24.770 --> 00:01:24.780 
apart so that they would be able to grow

00:01:24.780 --> 00:01:26.779 
apart so that they would be able to grow
much<00:01:25.140> larger<00:01:25.710> and<00:01:25.920> then<00:01:26.399> you<00:01:26.520> would<00:01:26.640> just

00:01:26.779 --> 00:01:26.789 
much larger and then you would just

00:01:26.789 --> 00:01:29.420 
much larger and then you would just
simply<00:01:27.030> I'll<00:01:27.450> demonstrate<00:01:27.689> here<00:01:28.380> grab<00:01:29.100> at<00:01:29.310> the

00:01:29.420 --> 00:01:29.430 
simply I'll demonstrate here grab at the

00:01:29.430 --> 00:01:33.020 
simply I'll demonstrate here grab at the
base<00:01:29.789> and<00:01:30.180> then<00:01:30.750> cut<00:01:31.200> across<00:01:31.579> so<00:01:32.579> you're<00:01:32.729> able

00:01:33.020 --> 00:01:33.030 
base and then cut across so you're able

00:01:33.030 --> 00:01:35.349 
base and then cut across so you're able
to<00:01:33.149> harvest<00:01:33.359> that<00:01:33.689> full<00:01:33.899> head<00:01:34.109> of<00:01:34.140> lettuce

00:01:35.349 --> 00:01:35.359 
to harvest that full head of lettuce

00:01:35.359 --> 00:01:38.690 
to harvest that full head of lettuce
your<00:01:36.359> other<00:01:36.539> option<00:01:37.049> of<00:01:37.200> course<00:01:37.490> would<00:01:38.490> be<00:01:38.520> to

00:01:38.690 --> 00:01:38.700 
your other option of course would be to

00:01:38.700 --> 00:01:42.050 
your other option of course would be to
pull<00:01:39.270> the<00:01:39.299> entire<00:01:40.109> head<00:01:40.469> out<00:01:40.770> now<00:01:41.130> if<00:01:41.729> you<00:01:41.789> pull

00:01:42.050 --> 00:01:42.060 
pull the entire head out now if you pull

00:01:42.060 --> 00:01:44.300 
pull the entire head out now if you pull
the<00:01:42.179> whole<00:01:42.359> ahead<00:01:42.719> out<00:01:42.990> it<00:01:43.409> won't<00:01:43.950> be<00:01:44.070> able<00:01:44.159> to

00:01:44.300 --> 00:01:44.310 
the whole ahead out it won't be able to

00:01:44.310 --> 00:01:46.999 
the whole ahead out it won't be able to
grow<00:01:44.670> again<00:01:44.869> so<00:01:45.869> my<00:01:46.049> tip<00:01:46.289> to<00:01:46.469> you<00:01:46.530> would<00:01:46.740> be<00:01:46.859> to

00:01:46.999 --> 00:01:47.009 
grow again so my tip to you would be to

00:01:47.009 --> 00:01:49.789 
grow again so my tip to you would be to
just<00:01:47.130> harvest<00:01:47.579> the<00:01:47.700> outside<00:01:48.210> leaves<00:01:48.990> that<00:01:49.530> way

00:01:49.789 --> 00:01:49.799 
just harvest the outside leaves that way

00:01:49.799 --> 00:01:51.800 
just harvest the outside leaves that way
the<00:01:50.219> head<00:01:50.490> of<00:01:50.609> lettuce<00:01:50.820> can<00:01:51.149> continue<00:01:51.539> to<00:01:51.630> grow

00:01:51.800 --> 00:01:51.810 
the head of lettuce can continue to grow

00:01:51.810 --> 00:01:54.590 
the head of lettuce can continue to grow
