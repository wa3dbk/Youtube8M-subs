you're a complete idiot and you switch
them<00:02:25.100> up<00:02:25.220> it'll<00:02:26.180> actually<00:02:26.330> sound<00:02:26.840> an<00:02:27.050> alarm<00:02:27.320> so

00:02:33.160 --> 00:02:33.170 
it's idiot-proof and also you can use it

00:02:33.170 --> 00:02:35.800 
it's idiot-proof and also you can use it
