00:00:05.630 --> 00:00:05.640 
planets at your video my name is matheus

00:00:05.640 --> 00:00:07.940 
planets at your video my name is matheus
and<00:00:06.150> this<00:00:06.420> is<00:00:06.540> my<00:00:06.690> second<00:00:07.230> aim<00:00:07.470> and<00:00:07.710> skill

00:00:07.940 --> 00:00:07.950 
and this is my second aim and skill

00:00:07.950 --> 00:00:10.040 
and this is my second aim and skill
tutorial<00:00:08.519> that's<00:00:08.849> mainly<00:00:09.450> going<00:00:09.750> to<00:00:09.870> be

00:00:10.040 --> 00:00:10.050 
tutorial that's mainly going to be

00:00:10.050 --> 00:00:12.080 
tutorial that's mainly going to be
focusing<00:00:10.469> on<00:00:10.620> burst<00:00:10.920> fire<00:00:11.219> and<00:00:11.700> when<00:00:11.820> it<00:00:11.940> comes

00:00:12.080 --> 00:00:12.090 
focusing on burst fire and when it comes

00:00:12.090 --> 00:00:13.640 
focusing on burst fire and when it comes
to<00:00:12.240> burst<00:00:12.420> fire<00:00:12.660> there<00:00:12.960> are<00:00:13.110> so<00:00:13.440> many

00:00:13.640 --> 00:00:13.650 
to burst fire there are so many

00:00:13.650 --> 00:00:16.220 
to burst fire there are so many
different<00:00:14.009> ways<00:00:14.250> of<00:00:14.580> bursting<00:00:15.570> that<00:00:15.870> I

00:00:16.220 --> 00:00:16.230 
different ways of bursting that I

00:00:16.230 --> 00:00:18.109 
different ways of bursting that I
probably<00:00:16.590> have<00:00:16.949> to<00:00:17.100> make<00:00:17.250> like<00:00:17.460> 20<00:00:17.850> videos

00:00:18.109 --> 00:00:18.119 
probably have to make like 20 videos

00:00:18.119 --> 00:00:19.519 
probably have to make like 20 videos
like<00:00:18.270> this<00:00:18.420> in<00:00:18.570> order<00:00:18.720> to<00:00:18.779> cover<00:00:19.080> all<00:00:19.289> of<00:00:19.320> it

00:00:19.519 --> 00:00:19.529 
like this in order to cover all of it

00:00:19.529 --> 00:00:21.710 
like this in order to cover all of it
what<00:00:20.100> I'm<00:00:20.220> going<00:00:20.460> to<00:00:20.550> focus<00:00:20.699> on<00:00:20.939> mostly<00:00:21.449> here

00:00:21.710 --> 00:00:21.720 
what I'm going to focus on mostly here

00:00:21.720 --> 00:00:23.480 
what I'm going to focus on mostly here
is<00:00:22.020> something<00:00:22.260> called<00:00:22.500> quick<00:00:22.859> bursting<00:00:23.340> and

00:00:23.480 --> 00:00:23.490 
is something called quick bursting and

00:00:23.490 --> 00:00:25.700 
is something called quick bursting and
many<00:00:24.150> times<00:00:24.390> it<00:00:24.539> can<00:00:24.600> be<00:00:24.720> really<00:00:24.810> difficult<00:00:25.289> to

00:00:25.700 --> 00:00:25.710 
many times it can be really difficult to

00:00:25.710 --> 00:00:27.080 
many times it can be really difficult to
see<00:00:25.949> the<00:00:26.099> difference<00:00:26.279> between<00:00:26.640> quick

00:00:27.080 --> 00:00:27.090 
see the difference between quick

00:00:27.090 --> 00:00:28.790 
see the difference between quick
bursting<00:00:27.480> and<00:00:27.599> fully<00:00:27.840> automatic<00:00:28.230> so<00:00:28.650> I'm

00:00:28.790 --> 00:00:28.800 
bursting and fully automatic so I'm

00:00:28.800 --> 00:00:30.800 
bursting and fully automatic so I'm
gonna<00:00:28.890> try<00:00:29.099> to<00:00:29.130> explain<00:00:29.849> that<00:00:30.060> as<00:00:30.300> best<00:00:30.599> I<00:00:30.750> can

00:00:30.800 --> 00:00:30.810 
gonna try to explain that as best I can

00:00:30.810 --> 00:00:32.569 
gonna try to explain that as best I can
I<00:00:31.289> would<00:00:31.470> also<00:00:31.619> try<00:00:31.800> to<00:00:31.859> show<00:00:32.189> you<00:00:32.250> the

00:00:32.569 --> 00:00:32.579 
I would also try to show you the

00:00:32.579 --> 00:00:34.069 
I would also try to show you the
difference<00:00:32.940> it<00:00:33.000> makes<00:00:33.239> if<00:00:33.390> you<00:00:33.510> actually<00:00:33.840> use

00:00:34.069 --> 00:00:34.079 
difference it makes if you actually use

00:00:34.079 --> 00:00:36.709 
difference it makes if you actually use
burst<00:00:34.649> fire<00:00:34.950> in<00:00:35.250> terms<00:00:35.550> of<00:00:35.820> the<00:00:36.090> weapon<00:00:36.420> spread

00:00:36.709 --> 00:00:36.719 
burst fire in terms of the weapon spread

00:00:36.719 --> 00:00:38.869 
burst fire in terms of the weapon spread
or<00:00:36.899> bullet<00:00:37.230> spread<00:00:37.380> and<00:00:37.710> what<00:00:38.520> is<00:00:38.610> also

00:00:38.869 --> 00:00:38.879 
or bullet spread and what is also

00:00:38.879 --> 00:00:41.420 
or bullet spread and what is also
commonly<00:00:39.149> known<00:00:39.210> as<00:00:39.360> cone<00:00:39.840> of<00:00:39.989> fire<00:00:40.430> now

00:00:41.420 --> 00:00:41.430 
commonly known as cone of fire now

00:00:41.430 --> 00:00:44.119 
commonly known as cone of fire now
obviously<00:00:41.850> at<00:00:42.090> long<00:00:42.390> ranges<00:00:42.870> your<00:00:43.129> thirsts

00:00:44.119 --> 00:00:44.129 
obviously at long ranges your thirsts

00:00:44.129 --> 00:00:46.190 
obviously at long ranges your thirsts
have<00:00:44.340> to<00:00:44.550> be<00:00:44.700> more<00:00:45.030> controlled<00:00:45.450> and<00:00:45.809> slower

00:00:46.190 --> 00:00:46.200 
have to be more controlled and slower

00:00:46.200 --> 00:00:48.470 
have to be more controlled and slower
and<00:00:46.590> here<00:00:46.829> I<00:00:46.860> actually<00:00:47.250> even<00:00:47.730> mix<00:00:48.059> it<00:00:48.149> up<00:00:48.329> with

00:00:48.470 --> 00:00:48.480 
and here I actually even mix it up with

00:00:48.480 --> 00:00:51.770 
and here I actually even mix it up with
a<00:00:48.539> single<00:00:49.020> shot<00:00:49.320> so<00:00:50.309> I'm<00:00:50.399> using<00:00:50.640> the<00:00:51.059> default

00:00:51.770 --> 00:00:51.780 
a single shot so I'm using the default

00:00:51.780 --> 00:00:54.740 
a single shot so I'm using the default
gun<00:00:51.989> of<00:00:52.199> the<00:00:52.500> engineer<00:00:52.920> class<00:00:53.100> called<00:00:53.670> AF<00:00:54.210> 19

00:00:54.740 --> 00:00:54.750 
gun of the engineer class called AF 19

00:00:54.750 --> 00:00:56.569 
gun of the engineer class called AF 19
mercenary<00:00:55.260> carbine<00:00:55.680> and<00:00:55.980> this<00:00:56.309> is<00:00:56.430> how<00:00:56.520> the

00:00:56.569 --> 00:00:56.579 
mercenary carbine and this is how the

00:00:56.579 --> 00:00:58.250 
mercenary carbine and this is how the
weapon<00:00:56.760> behaves<00:00:57.180> if<00:00:57.510> you<00:00:57.629> fire<00:00:57.840> it<00:00:57.870> fully

00:00:58.250 --> 00:00:58.260 
weapon behaves if you fire it fully

00:00:58.260 --> 00:01:00.319 
weapon behaves if you fire it fully
automatic<00:00:58.770> with<00:00:58.949> no<00:00:59.190> reco<00:00:59.640> compensation

00:01:00.319 --> 00:01:00.329 
automatic with no reco compensation

00:01:00.329 --> 00:01:04.399 
automatic with no reco compensation
whatsoever<00:01:02.420> so<00:01:03.420> next<00:01:03.600> up<00:01:03.780> here<00:01:04.019> I'm<00:01:04.110> going<00:01:04.260> to

00:01:04.399 --> 00:01:04.409 
whatsoever so next up here I'm going to

00:01:04.409 --> 00:01:06.679 
whatsoever so next up here I'm going to
try<00:01:04.559> to<00:01:04.619> compensate<00:01:04.920> for<00:01:05.640> the<00:01:06.030> recoil<00:01:06.420> by

00:01:06.679 --> 00:01:06.689 
try to compensate for the recoil by

00:01:06.689 --> 00:01:13.850 
try to compensate for the recoil by
pulling<00:01:07.200> the<00:01:07.320> mouse<00:01:07.530> down<00:01:08.070> as<00:01:08.369> a<00:01:08.700> fire<00:01:12.860> first

00:01:13.850 --> 00:01:13.860 
pulling the mouse down as a fire first

00:01:13.860 --> 00:01:16.190 
pulling the mouse down as a fire first
one<00:01:14.070> kind<00:01:14.460> of<00:01:14.549> sloppy<00:01:14.700> yeah<00:01:15.299> it's<00:01:15.509> a<00:01:15.630> bit<00:01:15.810> early

00:01:16.190 --> 00:01:16.200 
one kind of sloppy yeah it's a bit early

00:01:16.200 --> 00:01:17.810 
one kind of sloppy yeah it's a bit early
I<00:01:16.229> haven't<00:01:16.590> too<00:01:16.680> warmed<00:01:16.920> up<00:01:17.040> or<00:01:17.310> I<00:01:17.340> haven't

00:01:17.810 --> 00:01:17.820 
I haven't too warmed up or I haven't

00:01:17.820 --> 00:01:20.469 
I haven't too warmed up or I haven't
fired<00:01:18.119> my<00:01:18.270> gun<00:01:18.450> here<00:01:18.689> and<00:01:18.869> since<00:01:19.799> yesterday

00:01:20.469 --> 00:01:20.479 
fired my gun here and since yesterday

00:01:20.479 --> 00:01:23.390 
fired my gun here and since yesterday
second<00:01:21.479> one<00:01:21.630> a<00:01:22.049> little<00:01:22.530> bit<00:01:22.650> better<00:01:22.860> at<00:01:23.220> least

00:01:23.390 --> 00:01:23.400 
second one a little bit better at least

00:01:23.400 --> 00:01:27.859 
second one a little bit better at least
the<00:01:23.520> first<00:01:23.880> part<00:01:24.299> of<00:01:24.390> it<00:01:24.540> but<00:01:24.810> still<00:01:25.200> bad<00:01:26.869> third

00:01:27.859 --> 00:01:27.869 
the first part of it but still bad third

00:01:27.869 --> 00:01:31.280 
the first part of it but still bad third
one<00:01:28.430> here<00:01:29.430> I'm<00:01:29.820> getting<00:01:30.270> the<00:01:30.479> hang<00:01:30.659> of<00:01:30.810> it<00:01:30.930> and

00:01:31.280 --> 00:01:31.290 
one here I'm getting the hang of it and

00:01:31.290 --> 00:01:34.060 
one here I'm getting the hang of it and
I<00:01:31.590> am<00:01:32.400> able<00:01:32.610> to<00:01:32.670> control<00:01:32.880> the<00:01:33.119> weapon<00:01:33.270> the<00:01:33.570> way

00:01:34.060 --> 00:01:34.070 
I am able to control the weapon the way

00:01:34.070 --> 00:01:36.859 
I am able to control the weapon the way
yeah<00:01:35.070> the<00:01:35.220> way<00:01:35.340> I<00:01:35.369> would<00:01:35.759> control<00:01:36.390> it<00:01:36.540> when<00:01:36.840> I

00:01:36.859 --> 00:01:36.869 
yeah the way I would control it when I

00:01:36.869 --> 00:01:38.810 
yeah the way I would control it when I
fire<00:01:37.320> for<00:01:37.590> the<00:01:37.680> automatic<00:01:37.890> which<00:01:38.310> is

00:01:38.810 --> 00:01:38.820 
fire for the automatic which is

00:01:38.820 --> 00:01:40.340 
fire for the automatic which is
something<00:01:39.090> I<00:01:39.150> don't<00:01:39.210> do<00:01:39.509> all<00:01:39.689> that<00:01:39.720> much<00:01:40.049> but

00:01:40.340 --> 00:01:40.350 
something I don't do all that much but

00:01:40.350 --> 00:01:42.920 
something I don't do all that much but
when<00:01:41.130> I<00:01:41.159> do<00:01:41.280> this<00:01:42.060> is<00:01:42.180> how<00:01:42.270> I<00:01:42.299> try<00:01:42.540> to<00:01:42.600> do<00:01:42.780> it

00:01:42.920 --> 00:01:42.930 
when I do this is how I try to do it

00:01:42.930 --> 00:01:46.730 
when I do this is how I try to do it
next<00:01:44.329> up<00:01:45.329> here<00:01:45.540> I'm<00:01:45.720> going<00:01:45.869> to<00:01:46.020> use<00:01:46.170> burst<00:01:46.470> fire

00:01:46.730 --> 00:01:46.740 
next up here I'm going to use burst fire

00:01:46.740 --> 00:01:51.170 
next up here I'm going to use burst fire
and<00:01:47.040> look<00:01:47.729> closely<00:01:48.180> at<00:01:48.630> the<00:01:49.670> recoil<00:01:50.670> and<00:01:50.939> the

00:01:51.170 --> 00:01:51.180 
and look closely at the recoil and the

00:01:51.180 --> 00:01:53.480 
and look closely at the recoil and the
spread<00:01:51.479> of<00:01:51.509> the<00:01:51.689> weapon<00:01:52.049> it<00:01:52.740> looks<00:01:53.100> like

00:01:53.480 --> 00:01:53.490 
spread of the weapon it looks like

00:01:53.490 --> 00:01:55.999 
spread of the weapon it looks like
there's<00:01:54.360> very<00:01:54.630> little<00:01:54.990> to<00:01:55.380> benefit<00:01:55.860> from

00:01:55.999 --> 00:01:56.009 
there's very little to benefit from

00:01:56.009 --> 00:01:58.639 
there's very little to benefit from
actually<00:01:56.430> burst<00:01:56.610> firing<00:01:57.079> if<00:01:58.079> you<00:01:58.229> just<00:01:58.409> look

00:01:58.639 --> 00:01:58.649 
actually burst firing if you just look

00:01:58.649 --> 00:02:01.010 
actually burst firing if you just look
at<00:01:58.829> the<00:01:59.520> difference<00:01:59.909> of<00:02:00.119> how<00:02:00.420> the<00:02:00.479> aim

00:02:01.010 --> 00:02:01.020 
at the difference of how the aim

00:02:01.020 --> 00:02:03.679 
at the difference of how the aim
actually<00:02:01.740> moves<00:02:01.950> when<00:02:02.310> I'm<00:02:02.579> using<00:02:03.149> burst<00:02:03.479> fire

00:02:03.679 --> 00:02:03.689 
actually moves when I'm using burst fire

00:02:03.689 --> 00:02:07.249 
actually moves when I'm using burst fire
in<00:02:04.259> this<00:02:04.409> case<00:02:04.680> it's<00:02:05.430> a<00:02:06.180> few<00:02:06.719> bullets<00:02:07.049> in<00:02:07.140> each

00:02:07.249 --> 00:02:07.259 
in this case it's a few bullets in each

00:02:07.259 --> 00:02:09.650 
in this case it's a few bullets in each
burst<00:02:07.560> I'm<00:02:07.860> mixing<00:02:08.280> it<00:02:08.399> up<00:02:08.459> a<00:02:08.580> bit<00:02:08.629> anyway<00:02:09.629> a

00:02:09.650 --> 00:02:09.660 
burst I'm mixing it up a bit anyway a

00:02:09.660 --> 00:02:11.029 
burst I'm mixing it up a bit anyway a
lot<00:02:09.899> of<00:02:09.959> people<00:02:10.050> might<00:02:10.410> have<00:02:10.530> read<00:02:10.679> into<00:02:10.950> this

00:02:11.029 --> 00:02:11.039 
lot of people might have read into this

00:02:11.039 --> 00:02:11.500 
lot of people might have read into this
and<00:02:11.220> say

00:02:11.500 --> 00:02:11.510 
and say

00:02:11.510 --> 00:02:13.030 
and say
hey<00:02:11.629> there's<00:02:11.870> so<00:02:12.080> little<00:02:12.110> difference<00:02:12.620> why

00:02:13.030 --> 00:02:13.040 
hey there's so little difference why

00:02:13.040 --> 00:02:14.559 
hey there's so little difference why
would<00:02:13.250> I<00:02:13.280> even<00:02:13.430> burst<00:02:13.760> fire<00:02:13.970> I<00:02:14.150> might<00:02:14.299> as<00:02:14.420> well

00:02:14.559 --> 00:02:14.569 
would I even burst fire I might as well

00:02:14.569 --> 00:02:17.110 
would I even burst fire I might as well
just<00:02:14.870> use<00:02:15.319> fully<00:02:15.590> automatic<00:02:16.040> all<00:02:16.189> the<00:02:16.310> time<00:02:16.519> so

00:02:17.110 --> 00:02:17.120 
just use fully automatic all the time so

00:02:17.120 --> 00:02:18.880 
just use fully automatic all the time so
now<00:02:17.150> let's<00:02:17.689> take<00:02:17.840> a<00:02:17.900> look<00:02:18.079> at<00:02:18.290> where<00:02:18.709> the

00:02:18.880 --> 00:02:18.890 
now let's take a look at where the

00:02:18.890 --> 00:02:21.190 
now let's take a look at where the
bullets<00:02:19.220> actually<00:02:19.700> hit<00:02:19.909> this<00:02:20.720> is<00:02:20.959> fully

00:02:21.190 --> 00:02:21.200 
bullets actually hit this is fully

00:02:21.200 --> 00:02:23.500 
bullets actually hit this is fully
automatic<00:02:21.819> I'm<00:02:22.819> gonna<00:02:22.939> take<00:02:23.150> a<00:02:23.180> little<00:02:23.269> closer

00:02:23.500 --> 00:02:23.510 
automatic I'm gonna take a little closer

00:02:23.510 --> 00:02:25.179 
automatic I'm gonna take a little closer
look<00:02:23.629> at<00:02:23.840> the<00:02:23.900> wall<00:02:24.110> here<00:02:24.319> look<00:02:24.709> at<00:02:24.799> the<00:02:24.890> spread

00:02:25.179 --> 00:02:25.189 
look at the wall here look at the spread

00:02:25.189 --> 00:02:28.030 
look at the wall here look at the spread
you<00:02:25.430> see<00:02:26.209> the<00:02:26.569> cone<00:02:26.959> of<00:02:27.079> fire<00:02:27.110> or<00:02:27.500> spread<00:02:27.799> or

00:02:28.030 --> 00:02:28.040 
you see the cone of fire or spread or

00:02:28.040 --> 00:02:31.539 
you see the cone of fire or spread or
whatever<00:02:28.370> and<00:02:29.799> moving<00:02:30.799> back<00:02:30.920> here

00:02:31.539 --> 00:02:31.549 
whatever and moving back here

00:02:31.549 --> 00:02:37.449 
whatever and moving back here
this<00:02:32.450> is<00:02:32.599> burst<00:02:32.810> fire<00:02:34.780> and<00:02:36.129> take<00:02:37.129> a<00:02:37.159> look<00:02:37.370> at

00:02:37.449 --> 00:02:37.459 
this is burst fire and take a look at

00:02:37.459 --> 00:02:39.819 
this is burst fire and take a look at
the<00:02:37.549> difference<00:02:37.940> of<00:02:38.440> where<00:02:39.440> the<00:02:39.560> bullets

00:02:39.819 --> 00:02:39.829 
the difference of where the bullets

00:02:39.829 --> 00:02:42.970 
the difference of where the bullets
actually<00:02:40.099> land<00:02:40.720> so<00:02:41.720> I<00:02:41.750> will<00:02:42.019> do<00:02:42.200> the<00:02:42.409> exact

00:02:42.970 --> 00:02:42.980 
actually land so I will do the exact

00:02:42.980 --> 00:02:45.940 
actually land so I will do the exact
same<00:02:43.250> thing<00:02:43.549> again<00:02:44.049> first<00:02:45.049> off<00:02:45.349> on<00:02:45.829> the<00:02:45.859> left

00:02:45.940 --> 00:02:45.950 
same thing again first off on the left

00:02:45.950 --> 00:02:47.970 
same thing again first off on the left
side<00:02:46.220> here<00:02:46.430> this<00:02:46.730> is<00:02:46.940> fully<00:02:47.180> automatic<00:02:47.540> and

00:02:47.970 --> 00:02:47.980 
side here this is fully automatic and

00:02:47.980 --> 00:02:52.000 
side here this is fully automatic and
I'm<00:02:48.980> able<00:02:49.129> to<00:02:49.280> control<00:02:50.090> the<00:02:50.420> recoil<00:02:51.290> as<00:02:51.650> yeah

00:02:52.000 --> 00:02:52.010 
I'm able to control the recoil as yeah

00:02:52.010 --> 00:02:54.729 
I'm able to control the recoil as yeah
as<00:02:52.159> good<00:02:52.310> as<00:02:52.400> I<00:02:52.579> can<00:02:52.609> at<00:02:53.090> least<00:02:53.120> and<00:02:53.569> the<00:02:54.530> next

00:02:54.729 --> 00:02:54.739 
as good as I can at least and the next

00:02:54.739 --> 00:02:56.530 
as good as I can at least and the next
up<00:02:54.889> here<00:02:55.040> we'll<00:02:55.220> have<00:02:55.310> the<00:02:55.400> burst<00:02:55.670> fire<00:02:55.819> just

00:02:56.530 --> 00:02:56.540 
up here we'll have the burst fire just

00:02:56.540 --> 00:02:58.119 
up here we'll have the burst fire just
gonna<00:02:56.690> make<00:02:56.810> sure<00:02:56.959> that<00:02:57.139> I<00:02:57.170> am<00:02:57.470> at<00:02:57.500> the<00:02:57.709> same

00:02:58.119 --> 00:02:58.129 
gonna make sure that I am at the same

00:02:58.129 --> 00:03:04.259 
gonna make sure that I am at the same
position

00:03:04.259 --> 00:03:04.269 

00:03:04.269 --> 00:03:08.020 

so<00:03:05.269> let's<00:03:05.900> take<00:03:06.049> a<00:03:06.079> look<00:03:06.319> as<00:03:06.890> you<00:03:07.640> can<00:03:07.819> clearly

00:03:08.020 --> 00:03:08.030 
so let's take a look as you can clearly

00:03:08.030 --> 00:03:10.750 
so let's take a look as you can clearly
see<00:03:08.420> I<00:03:08.840> have<00:03:09.200> a<00:03:09.230> much<00:03:09.590> better<00:03:09.620> result<00:03:10.099> in<00:03:10.579> terms

00:03:10.750 --> 00:03:10.760 
see I have a much better result in terms

00:03:10.760 --> 00:03:12.190 
see I have a much better result in terms
of<00:03:10.939> accuracy<00:03:11.180> when<00:03:11.569> I'm<00:03:11.689> using<00:03:11.870> burst-fire

00:03:12.190 --> 00:03:12.200 
of accuracy when I'm using burst-fire

00:03:12.200 --> 00:03:14.649 
of accuracy when I'm using burst-fire
then<00:03:12.829> I<00:03:12.860> compared<00:03:13.489> to<00:03:13.549> with<00:03:14.030> the<00:03:14.150> year<00:03:14.420> fully

00:03:14.649 --> 00:03:14.659 
then I compared to with the year fully

00:03:14.659 --> 00:03:16.210 
then I compared to with the year fully
automatic<00:03:15.110> so<00:03:15.530> now<00:03:15.620> this<00:03:15.769> is<00:03:15.860> what<00:03:15.980> it<00:03:16.069> looks

00:03:16.210 --> 00:03:16.220 
automatic so now this is what it looks

00:03:16.220 --> 00:03:17.770 
automatic so now this is what it looks
like<00:03:16.370> when<00:03:16.610> I<00:03:16.640> put<00:03:16.879> it<00:03:16.939> into<00:03:17.060> practice<00:03:17.510> and

00:03:17.770 --> 00:03:17.780 
like when I put it into practice and

00:03:17.780 --> 00:03:20.710 
like when I put it into practice and
fire<00:03:18.470> it<00:03:18.650> in<00:03:18.829> in<00:03:19.189> game<00:03:19.370> situations<00:03:19.549> and<00:03:20.209> it

00:03:20.710 --> 00:03:20.720 
fire it in in game situations and it

00:03:20.720 --> 00:03:22.089 
fire it in in game situations and it
just<00:03:20.900> to<00:03:20.959> be<00:03:21.079> clear<00:03:21.290> I'm<00:03:21.650> gonna<00:03:21.829> have<00:03:21.980> to

00:03:22.089 --> 00:03:22.099 
just to be clear I'm gonna have to

00:03:22.099 --> 00:03:24.670 
just to be clear I'm gonna have to
repeat<00:03:22.370> myself<00:03:22.519> here<00:03:22.909> I<00:03:23.120> am<00:03:23.599> not<00:03:23.900> firing<00:03:24.230> fully

00:03:24.670 --> 00:03:24.680 
repeat myself here I am not firing fully

00:03:24.680 --> 00:03:26.860 
repeat myself here I am not firing fully
automatic<00:03:25.159> in<00:03:25.280> any<00:03:25.519> of<00:03:25.700> these<00:03:25.819> situations

00:03:26.860 --> 00:03:26.870 
automatic in any of these situations

00:03:26.870 --> 00:03:28.750 
automatic in any of these situations
now<00:03:27.170> obviously<00:03:27.349> the<00:03:28.010> way<00:03:28.159> you<00:03:28.220> recall

00:03:28.750 --> 00:03:28.760 
now obviously the way you recall

00:03:28.760 --> 00:03:30.520 
now obviously the way you recall
compensate<00:03:29.239> the<00:03:29.510> exact<00:03:29.900> way<00:03:30.079> you<00:03:30.109> move<00:03:30.379> your

00:03:30.520 --> 00:03:30.530 
compensate the exact way you move your

00:03:30.530 --> 00:03:32.559 
compensate the exact way you move your
hand<00:03:30.799> is<00:03:31.099> different<00:03:31.790> depending<00:03:32.060> on<00:03:32.359> what

00:03:32.559 --> 00:03:32.569 
hand is different depending on what

00:03:32.569 --> 00:03:35.319 
hand is different depending on what
weapon<00:03:32.900> you<00:03:32.989> use<00:03:33.170> but<00:03:33.650> the<00:03:34.400> basics<00:03:34.819> of<00:03:34.939> it<00:03:35.060> is

00:03:35.319 --> 00:03:35.329 
weapon you use but the basics of it is

00:03:35.329 --> 00:03:37.930 
weapon you use but the basics of it is
by<00:03:36.049> using<00:03:36.319> burst<00:03:36.709> fire<00:03:36.980> by<00:03:37.250> being<00:03:37.519> aware<00:03:37.879> of

00:03:37.930 --> 00:03:37.940 
by using burst fire by being aware of

00:03:37.940 --> 00:03:39.879 
by using burst fire by being aware of
this<00:03:38.269> the<00:03:38.720> difference<00:03:39.109> between<00:03:39.260> burst<00:03:39.650> fire

00:03:39.879 --> 00:03:39.889 
this the difference between burst fire

00:03:39.889 --> 00:03:42.430 
this the difference between burst fire
and<00:03:40.220> the<00:03:40.519> fully<00:03:40.730> automatic<00:03:41.120> this<00:03:41.840> has<00:03:42.079> a<00:03:42.109> big

00:03:42.430 --> 00:03:42.440 
and the fully automatic this has a big

00:03:42.440 --> 00:03:45.520 
and the fully automatic this has a big

00:03:55.210 --> 00:03:55.220 
much as well but influenza - anytime you

00:03:55.220 --> 00:03:58.210 
much as well but influenza - anytime you
fire<00:03:55.519> at<00:03:55.760> longer<00:03:56.120> range<00:03:56.420> than<00:03:56.889> 15<00:03:57.889> maybe<00:03:58.129> 20

00:03:58.220 --> 00:04:01.030 
fire at longer range than 15 maybe 20
meters<00:03:58.790> you<00:03:59.689> will<00:03:59.810> probably<00:04:00.230> benefit<00:04:00.680> by

00:04:01.030 --> 00:04:01.040 
meters you will probably benefit by
