00:00:14.299 --> 00:00:14.309 
understand now what I'm doing is using

00:00:14.309 --> 00:00:17.930 
understand now what I'm doing is using
the<00:00:14.670> vacuum<00:00:14.880> of<00:00:15.630> the<00:00:15.839> engine<00:00:16.320> to<00:00:16.609> pull<00:00:17.609> air

00:00:17.930 --> 00:00:17.940 
the vacuum of the engine to pull air

00:00:17.940 --> 00:00:21.590 
the vacuum of the engine to pull air
through<00:00:18.300> this<00:00:19.170> hose<00:00:19.529> right<00:00:19.859> here<00:00:20.220> and<00:00:20.400> this<00:00:21.270> is

00:00:21.590 --> 00:00:21.600 
through this hose right here and this is

00:00:21.600 --> 00:00:24.470 
through this hose right here and this is
this<00:00:22.320> nozzle<00:00:23.039> right<00:00:23.400> here<00:00:23.460> is<00:00:23.760> cut<00:00:24.000> off<00:00:24.180> right

00:00:24.470 --> 00:00:24.480 
this nozzle right here is cut off right

00:00:24.480 --> 00:00:27.650 
this nozzle right here is cut off right
at<00:00:24.720> the<00:00:25.019> top<00:00:25.289> and<00:00:25.820> this<00:00:26.820> one<00:00:27.119> goes<00:00:27.330> all<00:00:27.510> the<00:00:27.570> way

00:00:27.650 --> 00:00:27.660 
at the top and this one goes all the way

00:00:27.660 --> 00:00:30.259 
at the top and this one goes all the way
to<00:00:27.840> the<00:00:28.289> bottom<00:00:28.470> so<00:00:28.980> air<00:00:29.310> gets<00:00:29.670> pulled<00:00:30.029> through

00:00:30.259 --> 00:00:30.269 
to the bottom so air gets pulled through

00:00:30.269 --> 00:00:33.650 
to the bottom so air gets pulled through
this<00:00:31.109> pipe<00:00:31.529> down<00:00:32.309> to<00:00:32.550> the<00:00:32.640> bottom<00:00:33.059> which

00:00:33.650 --> 00:00:33.660 
this pipe down to the bottom which

00:00:33.660 --> 00:00:35.690 
this pipe down to the bottom which
bubbles<00:00:34.140> the<00:00:34.290> gas<00:00:34.500> up<00:00:34.800> into<00:00:35.160> a<00:00:35.190> vapor<00:00:35.520> which

00:00:35.690 --> 00:00:35.700 
bubbles the gas up into a vapor which

00:00:35.700 --> 00:00:39.200 
bubbles the gas up into a vapor which
gets<00:00:36.210> sucked<00:00:36.570> back<00:00:37.559> into<00:00:37.890> the<00:00:38.040> engine<00:00:38.460> and<00:00:38.550> I

00:00:39.200 --> 00:00:39.210 
gets sucked back into the engine and I

00:00:39.210 --> 00:00:43.130 
gets sucked back into the engine and I
have<00:00:39.450> this<00:00:39.719> I<00:00:41.059> have<00:00:42.059> the<00:00:42.360> exhaust<00:00:42.750> running

00:00:43.130 --> 00:00:43.140 
have this I have the exhaust running

00:00:43.140 --> 00:00:45.650 
have this I have the exhaust running
through<00:00:43.350> this<00:00:43.469> pipe<00:00:43.800> so<00:00:44.610> they'll<00:00:44.879> heat<00:00:45.390> this

00:00:45.650 --> 00:00:45.660 
through this pipe so they'll heat this

00:00:45.660 --> 00:00:48.740 
through this pipe so they'll heat this
pipe<00:00:45.930> up<00:00:46.230> and<00:00:46.440> heat<00:00:47.160> the<00:00:47.460> gas<00:00:47.879> up<00:00:48.239> a<00:00:48.390> little<00:00:48.570> bit

00:00:48.740 --> 00:00:48.750 
pipe up and heat the gas up a little bit

00:00:48.750 --> 00:00:51.319 
pipe up and heat the gas up a little bit
more<00:00:49.020> and<00:00:49.230> help<00:00:49.590> it<00:00:49.770> evaporate<00:00:50.430> a<00:00:50.670> little<00:00:50.879> bit

00:00:51.319 --> 00:00:51.329 
more and help it evaporate a little bit

00:00:51.329 --> 00:00:54.260 
more and help it evaporate a little bit
better<00:00:51.539> and<00:00:52.500> I'm<00:00:52.710> sorry<00:00:53.039> it<00:00:53.160> took<00:00:53.340> me<00:00:53.760> so<00:00:53.940> long

00:00:54.260 --> 00:00:54.270 
better and I'm sorry it took me so long

00:00:54.270 --> 00:00:57.650 
better and I'm sorry it took me so long
to<00:00:54.750> get<00:00:55.199> a<00:00:55.260> new<00:00:55.500> video<00:00:55.680> done<00:00:56.579> but<00:00:56.910> when<00:00:57.480> I<00:00:57.510> was

00:00:57.650 --> 00:00:57.660 
to get a new video done but when I was

00:00:57.660 --> 00:01:01.040 
to get a new video done but when I was
making<00:00:57.899> the<00:00:58.770> video<00:00:59.039> before<00:00:59.359> the<00:01:00.359> spring

00:01:01.040 --> 00:01:01.050 
making the video before the spring

00:01:01.050 --> 00:01:07.010 
making the video before the spring
inside<00:01:01.260> the<00:01:02.390> crank<00:01:03.390> the<00:01:04.640> pull<00:01:05.640> start<00:01:06.060> broke

00:01:07.010 --> 00:01:07.020 
inside the crank the pull start broke

00:01:07.020 --> 00:01:08.840 
inside the crank the pull start broke
and<00:01:07.290> so<00:01:07.470> had<00:01:07.680> to<00:01:07.710> get<00:01:07.950> a<00:01:08.010> new<00:01:08.100> one<00:01:08.430> and<00:01:08.549> replace

00:01:08.840 --> 00:01:08.850 
and so had to get a new one and replace

00:01:08.850 --> 00:01:13.340 
and so had to get a new one and replace
it<00:01:09.260> and<00:01:10.260> it's<00:01:11.130> about<00:01:11.280> 40<00:01:11.750> 40<00:01:12.750> degrees<00:01:13.110> out<00:01:13.320> here

00:01:13.340 --> 00:01:13.350 
it and it's about 40 40 degrees out here

00:01:13.350 --> 00:01:25.080 
it and it's about 40 40 degrees out here
so<00:01:13.770> it<00:01:13.860> will<00:01:14.070> take<00:01:14.340> a<00:01:14.369> second<00:01:14.850> start

00:01:25.080 --> 00:01:25.090
