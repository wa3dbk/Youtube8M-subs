so<00:00:33.570> I<00:00:34.160> didn't<00:00:35.160> test<00:00:35.309> this<00:00:35.460> around<00:00:35.760> I<00:00:35.969> played

00:00:36.170 --> 00:00:36.180 
so I didn't test this around I played

00:00:36.180 --> 00:00:37.729 
so I didn't test this around I played
around<00:00:36.329> with<00:00:36.510> it<00:00:36.660> for<00:00:36.690> a<00:00:36.899> bit<00:00:37.050> and<00:00:37.380> you<00:00:37.559> know<00:00:37.649> it

00:00:37.729 --> 00:00:37.739 
around with it for a bit and you know it

00:00:37.739 --> 00:00:39.350 
around with it for a bit and you know it
did<00:00:37.920> seem<00:00:38.100> like<00:00:38.280> a<00:00:38.309> really<00:00:38.610> good<00:00:38.760> app<00:00:38.879> so<00:00:39.149> I

00:00:39.350 --> 00:00:39.360 
did seem like a really good app so I

00:00:39.360 --> 00:00:40.369 
did seem like a really good app so I
thought<00:00:39.540> I<00:00:39.570> might<00:00:39.690> as<00:00:39.750> well<00:00:39.809> test<00:00:40.050> it<00:00:40.140> because

00:00:40.369 --> 00:00:40.379 
thought I might as well test it because

00:00:40.379 --> 00:00:43.069 
thought I might as well test it because
it<00:00:40.800> was<00:00:40.920> really<00:00:41.370> addictive<00:00:41.850> actually<00:00:42.180> so

00:00:43.069 --> 00:00:43.079 
it was really addictive actually so

00:00:43.079 --> 00:00:44.959 
it was really addictive actually so
let's<00:00:43.200> just<00:00:43.379> pull<00:00:43.590> down<00:00:43.620> that<00:00:44.219> I<00:00:44.430> felt

00:00:44.959 --> 00:00:44.969 
let's just pull down that I felt

00:00:44.969 --> 00:01:10.170 
let's just pull down that I felt

00:01:15.580 --> 00:01:15.590 
isn't from the start obviously cuz I

00:01:15.590 --> 00:01:17.830 
isn't from the start obviously cuz I
have<00:01:15.710> done<00:01:15.950> some<00:01:16.160> levels<00:01:16.460> myself<00:01:16.880> so<00:01:17.720> as<00:01:17.750> you

00:01:17.830 --> 00:01:17.840
