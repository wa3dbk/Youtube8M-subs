 mix and see how it is 

00:02:35.920 --> 00:02:42.030

00:02:46.269 --> 00:02:56.540

00:02:51.739 --> 00:03:00.470
 usually there principle can add 

00:02:56.540 --> 00:03:07.239
 the usual but smaller will be because 

00:03:00.470 --> 00:03:13.459

00:03:07.239 --> 00:03:16.190

00:03:18.920 --> 00:03:31.040
 I add a little bit just like me 

00:03:22.220 --> 00:03:35.690
 just love to have flavors take 

00:03:31.040 --> 00:03:44.480
 Run through the molds all over and 

00:03:35.690 --> 00:03:47.359
 silicone molds we spill it 

00:03:44.480 --> 00:03:51.889
 case we are in the molds and put in 

00:03:47.359 --> 00:03:53.410
 microwave for 2 minutes and even left 

00:03:51.889 --> 00:03:56.630
 can be a little smaller 

00:03:53.410 --> 00:04:03.160
 pour all that's straight on to a third 

00:03:56.630 --> 00:04:09.530
 third you here a lot now i am from a little bit 

00:04:03.160 --> 00:04:12.709
 I will postpone from there it turns out to me somewhere like 

00:04:09.530 --> 00:04:15.739
 when as but there will always be six pieces 

00:04:12.709 --> 00:04:19.639
 the release sometimes doesn't even know what anymore 

00:04:15.739 --> 00:04:22.970
 cialis so here and here I will postpone because 

00:04:19.639 --> 00:04:25.400
 much but then it will be over the top and all 

00:04:22.970 --> 00:04:28.010
 this thing we send microwave chu 

00:04:25.400 --> 00:04:30.889
 told the maximum power to 

00:04:28.010 --> 00:04:34.280
 one and a half minutes you put then 

00:04:30.889 --> 00:04:37.700
 look disconnect put the oven here 

00:04:34.280 --> 00:04:40.070
 I got such cupcakes like 

00:04:37.700 --> 00:04:42.860
 see they rise very much 

00:04:40.070 --> 00:04:46.400
 now after you took them out 

00:04:42.860 --> 00:04:48.529
 microwaves they need to get out 

00:04:46.400 --> 00:04:51.259
 molds 

00:04:48.529 --> 00:04:54.649
 it's very simple they take out of problems 

00:04:51.259 --> 00:05:00.249
 and put like this upside down 

00:04:54.649 --> 00:05:07.159

00:05:07.159 --> 00:05:15.679
 so do and leave to cool here 

00:05:14.089 --> 00:05:18.199
 they are generally very simple to see 

00:05:15.679 --> 00:05:20.449
 do not need to smear on the plague itself and 

00:05:18.199 --> 00:05:23.089
 so on in general so he is with me 

00:05:20.449 --> 00:05:24.229
 it turned out steel then just take out 

00:05:23.089 --> 00:05:26.569
