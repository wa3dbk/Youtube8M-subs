00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:13.080
 in a bowl and we go with saying then 

00:00:07.490 --> 00:00:18.390
 the seasoning can be seasoned in 

00:00:13.080 --> 00:00:22.289
 different ways so let's say you can 

00:00:18.390 --> 00:00:24.840
 simply put a little oil 

00:00:22.289 --> 00:00:26.880
 and salt or even put some 

00:00:24.840 --> 00:00:28.199
 mayonnaise 

00:00:26.880 --> 00:00:31.320
 but I thought of another kind of 

00:00:28.199 --> 00:00:34.739
 seasoning so let's see some 

00:00:31.320 --> 00:00:40.530
 ours what I would like 

00:00:34.739 --> 00:00:42.690
 eating then I first thought 

00:00:40.530 --> 00:00:46.399
 to put our hands as we are all 

00:00:42.690 --> 00:00:46.399
 waste that we no longer need 

00:00:47.960 --> 00:00:53.100
 ok 

00:00:49.820 --> 00:00:55.110
 first thought to use a little 

00:00:53.100 --> 00:00:57.930
 parsley like this here 

00:00:55.110 --> 00:01:00.180
 then I used it is ours 

00:00:57.930 --> 00:01:03.750
 I used frozen vegetables then 

00:01:00.180 --> 00:01:06.479
 unfortunately the appearance is not beautiful 

00:01:03.750 --> 00:01:08.939
 but let's say that the taste and smell there 

00:01:06.479 --> 00:01:11.930
 they are equally then then we will use 

00:01:08.939 --> 00:01:11.930
 of parsley 

00:01:13.970 --> 00:01:20.330
 here it is, then I thought of using 

00:01:18.570 --> 00:01:28.290
 a little garlic I saw that I man 

00:01:20.330 --> 00:01:28.890
 then let's put some yo of it 

00:01:28.290 --> 00:01:31.530
 raidue 

00:01:28.890 --> 00:01:33.060
 in this case already removed the soul as it is 

00:01:31.530 --> 00:01:36.240
 see why 

00:01:33.060 --> 00:01:40.680
 here it is because it is quite heavy 

00:01:36.240 --> 00:01:45.530
 therefore to avoid not clarifying it 

00:01:40.680 --> 00:01:45.530
 he thought of removing the interior 

00:01:46.060 --> 00:01:56.770
 ok so let's take the newly elected 

00:01:48.640 --> 00:01:56.770
 let's just start small bits 

00:01:57.550 --> 00:02:17.260
 small think so here it seems not 

00:02:14.810 --> 00:02:19.459
 be too big because then there are 

00:02:17.260 --> 00:02:24.050
 annoying if we had to complain about one 

00:02:19.459 --> 00:02:29.239
 it would also be useful to use it 

00:02:24.050 --> 00:02:34.060
 because even with his brother rhodri here 

00:02:29.239 --> 00:02:38.290
 we help together with the others imola 

00:02:34.060 --> 00:02:38.290
 then what you need to take 

00:02:42.400 --> 00:02:50.870
 what you need to take now 

00:02:46.520 --> 00:02:53.330
 parsley are capers 

00:02:50.870 --> 00:02:56.709
 here they are salted capers then you need to 

00:02:53.330 --> 00:03:00.470
 to install them so I use water 

00:02:56.709 --> 00:03:03.049
 so and I pour them a little into the water but 

00:03:00.470 --> 00:03:05.390
 not too much because salt will serve us for 

00:03:03.049 --> 00:03:10.040
 then season our veterans then 

00:03:05.390 --> 00:03:14.060
 I simply do so a little bit e 

00:03:10.040 --> 00:03:16.510
 then I put them here too I also do 

00:03:14.060 --> 00:03:16.510
 with the others 

00:03:17.740 --> 00:03:26.000
 so just just to take that away 

00:03:22.010 --> 00:03:27.950
 that there is the surplus here I do not tolerate 

00:03:26.000 --> 00:03:30.710
 just all the salt 

00:03:27.950 --> 00:03:45.440
 because what will give us then a little bit 

00:03:30.710 --> 00:03:48.380
 taste ok again and then evola and then 

00:03:45.440 --> 00:04:13.220
 we also go with the knife to cut the 

00:03:48.380 --> 00:04:15.140
 our capers so here is one now 

00:04:13.220 --> 00:04:26.300
 with all this one this trite 

00:04:15.140 --> 00:04:28.220
 we have to go and make a sauce a 

00:04:26.300 --> 00:04:35.270
 take then we first have 

00:04:28.220 --> 00:04:37.630
 this we will need for the sauce and 

00:04:35.270 --> 00:04:37.630
 then 

00:04:41.419 --> 00:04:54.479
 ok so let 's take the sauce 

00:04:49.879 --> 00:04:58.649
 I took a coffee cup of oil 

00:04:54.479 --> 00:05:02.209
 oil and put it in here inside 

00:04:58.649 --> 00:05:02.209
 this other container 

00:05:03.769 --> 00:05:21.539
 after which we still have a small one 

00:05:09.839 --> 00:05:25.739
 temptation cards after which I put everything 

00:05:21.539 --> 00:05:30.749
 inside the oil all that I 

00:05:25.739 --> 00:05:35.579
 minced wizard in hate then the 

00:05:30.749 --> 00:05:37.439
 parsley the garlic and capers we put 

00:05:35.579 --> 00:05:42.689
 in their way to form a small one 

00:05:37.439 --> 00:05:46.129
 I am sure in here we take a 

00:05:42.689 --> 00:05:46.129
 spoon let's say 

00:05:55.289 --> 00:06:12.240
 and that but we just have not put it on 

00:06:02.550 --> 00:06:15.559
 our roots is as rare as this 

00:06:12.240 --> 00:06:19.289
 it's another to not feel so holy 

00:06:15.559 --> 00:06:22.189
 place of bitter income for whom 

00:06:19.289 --> 00:06:25.499
 may also add lemon 

00:06:22.189 --> 00:06:47.669
 some lemon uk is quite damp 

00:06:25.499 --> 00:06:53.699
 this flavor and dish is ready now 

00:06:47.669 --> 00:06:58.979
 we just have to taste caspita here 

00:06:53.699 --> 00:07:05.779
 here it is here now we just have to 

00:06:58.979 --> 00:07:05.779
 taste then we walk 

00:07:09.500 --> 00:07:28.370
 so here I am so let's see some 

00:07:18.950 --> 00:07:31.080
 the taste of this very good dish 

00:07:28.370 --> 00:07:32.930
 good but I have to say that you can't hear it 

00:07:31.080 --> 00:07:35.900
 not even the bitter taste 

00:07:32.930 --> 00:07:38.240
 I hope you enjoyed this recipe 

00:07:35.900 --> 00:07:41.240
 and see you next time 

00:07:38.240 --> 00:07:41.240
