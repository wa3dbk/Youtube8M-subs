 that's why you should be very careful 

00:01:25.259 --> 00:01:30.330
 when choosing your dress I sometimes get 

00:01:27.780 --> 00:01:33.179
 asked why the clothes that you most 

00:01:30.330 --> 00:01:36.000
 like it does not look like you want is very 

00:01:33.179 --> 00:01:39.330
 simple because you're not wearing clothes 

00:01:36.000 --> 00:01:42.330
 suitable for you and your body today 

00:01:39.330 --> 00:01:45.390
 I will release the 12 types of bodies 

00:01:42.330 --> 00:01:49.649
 that there are for women these types of 

00:01:45.390 --> 00:01:51.479
 bodies the experts have pointed out and 

00:01:49.649 --> 00:01:52.940
 they have characterized them so that 

00:01:51.479 --> 00:01:56.490
 depending on your characteristics 

00:01:52.940 --> 00:01:58.370
 physical and your attributes know that 

00:01:56.490 --> 00:02:01.220
 put you 

00:01:58.370 --> 00:02:05.120
 your body so let's start because the 

00:02:01.220 --> 00:02:07.400
 first type of body is the apple type 

00:02:05.120 --> 00:02:09.860
 your ideal dress is one that is not very 

00:02:07.400 --> 00:02:12.350
 loose and do not have the skirt 

00:02:09.860 --> 00:02:16.940
 too wide we recommend that you use 

00:02:12.350 --> 00:02:19.740
 it's a dress a little tight type 

00:02:16.940 --> 00:02:22.170
 those would come in handy 

00:02:19.740 --> 00:02:23.670
 the next dress this called plan 

00:02:22.170 --> 00:02:26.580
 brightness 

00:02:23.670 --> 00:02:28.660
 or commonly called a swimmer because 

00:02:26.580 --> 00:02:31.180
 nothing here 

00:02:28.660 --> 00:02:33.700
 here the most recommended for that 

00:02:31.180 --> 00:02:36.580
 type of bodies is that you wear a dress 

00:02:33.700 --> 00:02:39.070
 not too tight but there is a 

00:02:36.580 --> 00:02:41.110
 little bit wide where they help you 

00:02:39.070 --> 00:02:43.790
 show off your attributes 

00:02:41.110 --> 00:02:47.540
 you can wear shoulder pads 

00:02:43.790 --> 00:02:51.630
 for being a little wider and avoid 

00:02:47.540 --> 00:02:53.970
 the tight things the vase 

00:02:51.630 --> 00:02:56.700
 This type of fourballs is characterized 

00:02:53.970 --> 00:02:59.910
 because from the top they are more 

00:02:56.700 --> 00:03:02.760
 narrow that from the bottom and they are 

00:02:59.910 --> 00:03:05.670
 of bubis a little bit big looking for a 

00:03:02.760 --> 00:03:08.940
 dress that helps you show off your 

00:03:05.670 --> 00:03:11.490
 attributes an attractive pretty neckline and 

00:03:08.940 --> 00:03:16.030
 pleasing to the eye a brown one 

00:03:11.490 --> 00:03:19.680
 little bit wide for this to be done to you 

00:03:16.030 --> 00:03:19.680
 a little more balanced 

00:03:27.610 --> 00:03:32.320
 the next type of bodies is the 

00:03:29.590 --> 00:03:34.390
 called guitar this body are the 

00:03:32.320 --> 00:03:38.170
 people who have broad shoulders 

00:03:34.390 --> 00:03:41.620
 Big boobs and very tight waist 

00:03:38.170 --> 00:03:44.440
 you can use a neckline equal very 

00:03:41.620 --> 00:03:47.050
 Very nice attractive and a very skirt 

00:03:44.440 --> 00:03:51.160
 wide otherwise you will see a 

00:03:47.050 --> 00:03:54.280
 little bit well athletic this powder well no 

00:03:51.160 --> 00:03:57.240

 bodies that I believe that in girls is 

00:04:01.750 --> 00:04:08.560
 very common you must use a corset that 

00:04:05.320 --> 00:04:10.240
 it is very striking one that is decorated 

00:04:08.560 --> 00:04:12.940
 with rhinestones 

00:04:10.240 --> 00:04:16.690
 some accessories and that part 

00:04:12.940 --> 00:04:19.920
 central have inverted parentheses 

00:04:16.690 --> 00:04:23.470

00:04:19.920 --> 00:04:25.540
 curvature in your waist and by the 

00:04:23.470 --> 00:04:27.940
