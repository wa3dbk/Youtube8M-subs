00:01:56.670 --> 00:01:58.670 
that could get disrupted peaking around
24<00:01:57.450> so<00:01:57.630> your<00:01:57.840> point<00:01:58.020> is<00:01:58.170> we<00:01:58.320> can't<00:01:58.560> do<00:01:58.649> anything

00:01:58.670 --> 00:01:58.680 
24 so your point is we can't do anything

00:01:58.680 --> 00:02:00.319 
24 so your point is we can't do anything
about<00:01:59.039> it<00:01:59.219> in<00:01:59.430> space<00:01:59.670> but<00:01:59.909> we<00:02:00.030> can't<00:02:00.240> do

00:02:00.319 --> 00:02:00.329 
about it in space but we can't do

00:02:00.329 --> 00:02:01.849 
about it in space but we can't do
something<00:02:00.359> back<00:02:00.810> here<00:02:00.840> on<00:02:01.140> earth<00:02:01.289> that's

00:02:01.849 --> 00:02:01.859 
something back here on earth that's

00:02:01.859 --> 00:02:03.410 
something back here on earth that's
right<00:02:02.070> we've<00:02:02.310> got<00:02:02.340> backup<00:02:02.880> systems<00:02:03.299> or

00:02:03.410 --> 00:02:03.420 
right we've got backup systems or

00:02:03.420 --> 00:02:05.330 
right we've got backup systems or
companies<00:02:03.780> really<00:02:03.930> doing<00:02:04.289> that<00:02:04.320> well<00:02:05.070> they're

00:02:05.330 --> 00:02:05.340 
companies really doing that well they're

00:02:05.340 --> 00:02:06.800 
companies really doing that well they're
going<00:02:05.460> to<00:02:05.520> have<00:02:05.700> to<00:02:05.850> do<00:02:06.000> it<00:02:06.149> because<00:02:06.450> see<00:02:06.659> we

00:02:06.800 --> 00:02:06.810 
going to have to do it because see we

00:02:06.810 --> 00:02:08.990 
going to have to do it because see we
scientists<00:02:07.380> made<00:02:07.560> a<00:02:07.590> mistake<00:02:08.100> we<00:02:08.759> thought

00:02:08.990 --> 00:02:09.000 
scientists made a mistake we thought

00:02:09.000 --> 00:02:10.430 
scientists made a mistake we thought
that<00:02:09.060> the<00:02:09.330> next<00:02:09.600> cycle<00:02:09.810> was<00:02:10.140> going<00:02:10.289> to<00:02:10.349> be

00:02:10.430 --> 00:02:10.440 
that the next cycle was going to be

00:02:10.440 --> 00:02:12.740 
that the next cycle was going to be
quiet<00:02:10.769> well<00:02:11.459> some<00:02:11.700> of<00:02:11.730> our<00:02:11.940> data<00:02:12.180> was<00:02:12.360> off<00:02:12.540> by<00:02:12.720> a

00:02:12.740 --> 00:02:12.750 
quiet well some of our data was off by a

00:02:12.750 --> 00:02:15.050 
quiet well some of our data was off by a
factor<00:02:13.019> of<00:02:13.230> 20<00:02:13.860> and<00:02:14.099> that's<00:02:14.670> why<00:02:14.849> we're

00:02:15.050 --> 00:02:15.060 
factor of 20 and that's why we're

00:02:15.060 --> 00:02:15.740 
factor of 20 and that's why we're
issuing<00:02:15.360> this

00:02:15.740 --> 00:02:15.750 
issuing this

00:02:15.750 --> 00:02:18.440 
issuing this
now<00:02:16.350> we<00:02:16.680> made<00:02:16.830> a<00:02:16.860> mistake<00:02:16.950> the<00:02:17.790> next<00:02:18.210> cycle

00:02:18.440 --> 00:02:18.450 
now we made a mistake the next cycle

00:02:18.450 --> 00:02:21.200 
now we made a mistake the next cycle
peeking<00:02:19.200> around<00:02:19.290> 2012<00:02:20.010> will<00:02:20.550> be<00:02:20.700> much<00:02:20.940> more

00:02:21.200 --> 00:02:21.210 
peeking around 2012 will be much more

00:02:21.210 --> 00:02:23.450 
peeking around 2012 will be much more
serious<00:02:21.750> than<00:02:21.900> we<00:02:22.020> previously<00:02:22.200> thought<00:02:22.650> now

00:02:23.450 --> 00:02:23.460 
serious than we previously thought now

00:02:23.460 --> 00:02:25.580 
serious than we previously thought now
in<00:02:23.610> the<00:02:23.730> past<00:02:23.970> we<00:02:24.270> dodged<00:02:24.540> the<00:02:24.810> bullet<00:02:24.960> because

00:02:25.580 --> 00:02:25.590 
in the past we dodged the bullet because

00:02:25.590 --> 00:02:27.260 
in the past we dodged the bullet because
we<00:02:25.830> didn't<00:02:26.070> have<00:02:26.100> that<00:02:26.310> many<00:02:26.430> satellites<00:02:26.910> up

00:02:27.260 --> 00:02:27.270 
we didn't have that many satellites up

00:02:27.270 --> 00:02:30.380 
we didn't have that many satellites up
there<00:02:27.300> 11<00:02:28.110> 22<00:02:28.680> years<00:02:28.950> ago<00:02:29.220> back<00:02:29.880> in<00:02:29.910> nineteen

00:02:30.380 --> 00:02:30.390 
there 11 22 years ago back in nineteen

00:02:30.390 --> 00:02:32.360 
there 11 22 years ago back in nineteen
ninety<00:02:30.420> we<00:02:30.930> didn't<00:02:31.230> have<00:02:31.440> that<00:02:31.740> many<00:02:31.950> space

00:02:32.360 --> 00:02:32.370 
ninety we didn't have that many space

00:02:32.370 --> 00:02:34.040 
ninety we didn't have that many space
satellite<00:02:32.820> well<00:02:32.970> that<00:02:33.270> makes<00:02:33.480> sense<00:02:33.630> to<00:02:33.870> me

00:02:34.040 --> 00:02:34.050 
satellite well that makes sense to me

00:02:34.050 --> 00:02:35.360 
satellite well that makes sense to me
but<00:02:34.200> yeah<00:02:34.350> I'm<00:02:34.560> listening<00:02:34.740> to<00:02:34.950> talk<00:02:35.190> i'm

00:02:35.360 --> 00:02:35.370 
but yeah I'm listening to talk i'm

00:02:35.370 --> 00:02:37.970 
but yeah I'm listening to talk i'm
thinking<00:02:35.670> y2k<00:02:36.200> i'm<00:02:37.200> thinking<00:02:37.560> is<00:02:37.620> all<00:02:37.740> just

00:02:37.970 --> 00:02:37.980 
thinking y2k i'm thinking is all just

00:02:37.980 --> 00:02:41.120 
thinking y2k i'm thinking is all just
it's<00:02:38.250> just<00:02:38.370> a<00:02:38.780> tactic<00:02:39.780> that<00:02:39.890> put<00:02:40.890> a<00:02:40.920> lot<00:02:41.100> of

00:02:41.120 --> 00:02:41.130 
it's just a tactic that put a lot of

00:02:41.130 --> 00:02:43.220 
it's just a tactic that put a lot of
fear<00:02:41.370> and<00:02:41.400> a<00:02:41.520> lot<00:02:41.610> of<00:02:41.640> people<00:02:41.780> it<00:02:42.780> may<00:02:43.140> have

00:02:43.220 --> 00:02:43.230 
fear and a lot of people it may have

00:02:43.230 --> 00:02:44.870 
fear and a lot of people it may have
gotten<00:02:43.440> us<00:02:43.620> ready<00:02:43.860> but<00:02:44.100> there<00:02:44.370> is<00:02:44.490> really<00:02:44.760> no

00:02:44.870 --> 00:02:44.880 
gotten us ready but there is really no

00:02:44.880 --> 00:02:47.510 
gotten us ready but there is really no
danger<00:02:45.240> in<00:02:45.270> the<00:02:45.450> end<00:02:45.600> well<00:02:46.410> let's<00:02:47.190> hope<00:02:47.490> that

00:02:47.510 --> 00:02:47.520 
danger in the end well let's hope that

00:02:47.520 --> 00:02:49.820 
danger in the end well let's hope that
it's<00:02:47.880> a<00:02:48.000> dud<00:02:48.239> let's<00:02:48.989> hope<00:02:49.200> that<00:02:49.290> nothing

00:02:49.820 --> 00:02:49.830 
it's a dud let's hope that nothing

00:02:49.830 --> 00:02:53.300 
it's a dud let's hope that nothing
happens<00:02:50.430> however<00:02:51.300> what<00:02:52.140> if<00:02:52.350> what<00:02:53.070> if<00:02:53.100> our

too<00:03:00.600> seriously<00:03:00.780> i<00:03:01.230> think<00:03:01.800> we're<00:03:01.950> going<00:03:01.980> to

00:03:02.150 --> 00:03:02.160 
too seriously i think we're going to

11<00:03:47.700> years<00:03:48.420> apart<00:03:48.720> 2012<00:03:49.530> the<00:03:49.650> next<00:03:49.890> one<00:03:50.040> okay<00:03:50.370> so

00:03:50.420 --> 00:03:50.430 
11 years apart 2012 the next one okay so

00:03:50.430 --> 00:03:52.550 
11 years apart 2012 the next one okay so
the<00:03:50.610> last<00:03:50.760> one<00:03:51.000> was<00:03:51.120> minor<00:03:51.420> so<00:03:52.019> the<00:03:52.140> scientists

00:03:52.550 --> 00:03:52.560 
the last one was minor so the scientists

00:03:52.560 --> 00:03:53.750 
the last one was minor so the scientists
are<00:03:52.680> to<00:03:52.739> blame<00:03:52.920> for<00:03:52.980> that<00:03:53.280> because<00:03:53.519> they

00:03:53.750 --> 00:03:53.760 
are to blame for that because they

00:03:53.760 --> 00:03:55.490 
are to blame for that because they
underestimated<00:03:54.329> the<00:03:54.450> power<00:03:54.600> and<00:03:55.320> they<00:03:55.440> think

00:03:55.490 --> 00:03:55.500 
underestimated the power and they think

00:03:55.500 --> 00:03:57.039 
underestimated the power and they think
this<00:03:55.739> time<00:03:55.950> it<00:03:56.070> could<00:03:56.160> be<00:03:56.220> the<00:03:56.370> big<00:03:56.489> one<00:03:56.519> I

00:03:57.039 --> 00:03:57.049 
this time it could be the big one I

00:03:57.049 --> 00:04:00.410 
this time it could be the big one I
think<00:03:58.160> he<00:03:59.160> is<00:03:59.190> the<00:03:59.549> most<00:03:59.700> understandable

00:04:00.410 --> 00:04:00.420 
think he is the most understandable

00:04:00.420 --> 00:04:01.940 
think he is the most understandable
physicist<00:04:00.959> I've<00:04:01.110> ever<00:04:01.320> had<00:04:01.500> the<00:04:01.590> pleasure<00:04:01.709> of

00:04:01.940 --> 00:04:01.950 
physicist I've ever had the pleasure of

00:04:01.950 --> 00:04:03.710 
physicist I've ever had the pleasure of
listening<00:04:02.220> to<00:04:02.459> am<00:04:02.790> I<00:04:02.880> wrong<00:04:03.030> you<00:04:03.420> guys<00:04:03.540> left
