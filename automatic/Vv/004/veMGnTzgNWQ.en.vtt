 was a very disparate retiree 

00:00:13.290 --> 00:00:15.990
 resented the possible increase in prices 

00:00:15.030 --> 00:00:18.270
 products 

00:00:15.990 --> 00:00:21.029
 mortgage holders demanded to forgive the dollar 

00:00:18.270 --> 00:00:22.769
 loans and small entrepreneurs just 

00:00:21.029 --> 00:00:24.000
 complained about the sharp rise 

00:00:22.769 --> 00:00:28.340
 dollar rate 

00:00:24.000 --> 00:00:28.340
 Alexey Fisher studied all requirements 

00:00:28.670 --> 00:00:33.059
 outraged citizens began to gather around 

00:00:31.050 --> 00:00:35.040
 National Bank to deploy in the morning 

00:00:33.059 --> 00:00:36.690
 posters did not organize a rally 

00:00:35.040 --> 00:00:38.220
 immediately demanded that they come to them 

00:00:36.690 --> 00:00:39.809
 Kairat Kelimbetov personally 

00:00:38.220 --> 00:00:41.879
 and only when they learned that he was 

00:00:39.809 --> 00:00:44.309
 business trip agreed on the deputy 

00:00:41.879 --> 00:00:46.680
 such this recently is you then 

00:00:44.309 --> 00:00:48.089
 already on us 1 us from paying attention 

00:00:46.680 --> 00:00:50.100
 let's get here first dan 

00:00:48.089 --> 00:00:51.870
 after being called up to the staff of the National Bank 

00:00:50.100 --> 00:00:53.970
 civilized dialogue people passed 

00:00:51.870 --> 00:00:56.580
 inside the building but the deputy is not all 

00:00:53.970 --> 00:01:03.150
 appeared and then decided to call again 

00:00:56.580 --> 00:01:05.040
 keel shattered conversation with bankers in 

00:01:03.150 --> 00:01:07.020
 result still held each 

00:01:05.040 --> 00:01:08.880
 activists tried to express their opinions 

00:01:07.020 --> 00:01:10.770
 some demanded to recognize the devaluation 

00:01:08.880 --> 00:01:13.080
 force majeure and return to the previous course 

00:01:10.770 --> 00:01:14.990
 dollar others asked not to raise prices 

00:01:13.080 --> 00:01:17.460
 3 with writing them dollar loans 

00:01:14.990 --> 00:01:26.479
 most of the claims turned out to be 

00:01:17.460 --> 00:01:26.479
 wrong address he should work and 

00:01:27.350 --> 00:01:33.090
 stop writing i understand this 

00:01:30.750 --> 00:01:36.030
 the question is necessary in view of the devaluation 

00:01:33.090 --> 00:01:37.220
 just step up and we keep this 

00:01:36.030 --> 00:01:39.740
 question on 

00:01:37.220 --> 00:01:42.200
 on the pulse we are a working group on 

00:01:39.740 --> 00:01:44.240
 mortgage collectors we have a working group and dad 

00:01:42.200 --> 00:01:46.100
 you are close to 3 so naturally a lot 

00:01:44.240 --> 00:01:47.720
 We talked about yesterday's devaluation in 

00:01:46.100 --> 00:01:50.690
 today in exchangers american dollar 

00:01:47.720 --> 00:01:52.040
 sold at least 183 tenge although 

00:01:50.690 --> 00:01:53.960
 in the morning on the site of the National Bank 

00:01:52.040 --> 00:01:56.720
 because of yesterday's confusion hung 

00:01:53.960 --> 00:01:58.640
 strange rate 163 tenge per dollar 

00:01:56.720 --> 00:02:00.920
 chief banker of the Kelimbetov Uprising 

00:01:58.640 --> 00:02:03.080
 called it a technical error again 

00:02:00.920 --> 00:02:05.810
 I will remind the new formula dollar 

00:02:03.080 --> 00:02:07.910
 should now fluctuate around 185 

00:02:05.810 --> 00:02:09.140
 and the difference between buying and selling is not 

00:02:07.910 --> 00:02:10.790
 exceed 2 tenge 

00:02:09.140 --> 00:02:12.740
 exchangers that speculate on 

00:02:10.790 --> 00:02:14.720
 devaluations promise to punish 

00:02:12.740 --> 00:02:17.450
 government instead of unpaired 

00:02:14.720 --> 00:02:19.880
 connected we will close all the notorious 

00:02:17.450 --> 00:02:22.790
 items that allow yourself this yesterday 

00:02:19.880 --> 00:02:25.040
 was released close and they are no longer 

00:02:22.790 --> 00:02:28.459
 will work in the market it concerns how 

00:02:25.040 --> 00:02:30.200
 and exchange points that say 

00:02:28.459 --> 00:02:31.850
 independent go exchange points 

00:02:30.200 --> 00:02:33.950
 which refer to certain 

00:02:31.850 --> 00:02:35.780
 however, economists say what's good 

00:02:33.950 --> 00:02:37.040
 from devaluation really is to 

00:02:35.780 --> 00:02:39.440
 example for the country's budget 

00:02:37.040 --> 00:02:41.090
 exporters and big business unprofitable 

00:02:39.440 --> 00:02:42.500
 dollar increase for consumers 

00:02:41.090 --> 00:02:45.110
 prices for imported goods will rise 

00:02:42.500 --> 00:02:47.920
 home appliances cars computers 

00:02:45.110 --> 00:02:50.240
 sectors that are tied to exports to 

00:02:47.920 --> 00:02:52.760
 our case is almost completely 

00:02:50.240 --> 00:02:53.210
 raw materials or semi-finished products such as 

00:02:52.760 --> 00:03:00.080
 eg 

00:02:53.210 --> 00:03:03.290
 metal they win since king 

00:03:00.080 --> 00:03:05.360
 expression they have revenue you are increasing 

00:03:03.290 --> 00:03:07.430
 economists in one voice recommends 

00:03:05.360 --> 00:03:09.830
 citizens wait a little time 

00:03:07.430 --> 00:03:11.930
 run to exchange offices and buy currency because 

00:03:09.830 --> 00:03:14.720
 dollar exchange rate depends on trading on the exchange 

00:03:11.930 --> 00:03:17.450
 and today there is a revival after yesterday 

00:03:14.720 --> 00:03:19.550
 lull trading closed at around one hundred 

00:03:17.450 --> 00:03:22.280
 eighty four and a half tenge per 

00:03:19.550 --> 00:03:25.430
 dollar and this value is national bank 

00:03:22.280 --> 00:03:25.940
 already set as official rate to 13 

00:03:25.430 --> 00:03:28.100
 February
