all the spark that you guys there's
always<00:01:14.300> a<00:01:14.480> lot<00:01:14.690> of<00:01:14.810> challenges<00:01:15.020> when<00:01:15.440> creating

00:01:15.640 --> 00:01:15.650 
always a lot of challenges when creating

00:01:15.650 --> 00:01:17.980 
always a lot of challenges when creating
a<00:01:15.950> video<00:01:16.100> game<00:01:16.430> but<00:01:17.150> for<00:01:17.300> conviction<00:01:17.840> our

00:01:17.980 --> 00:01:17.990 
a video game but for conviction our

00:01:17.990 --> 00:01:20.170 
a video game but for conviction our
number<00:01:18.260> one<00:01:18.440> challenge<00:01:18.950> was<00:01:19.430> reinventing

00:01:20.170 --> 00:01:20.180 
number one challenge was reinventing

00:01:20.180 --> 00:01:22.870 
number one challenge was reinventing
stunts<00:01:20.540> so<00:01:21.410> we<00:01:21.590> had<00:01:21.710> to<00:01:21.890> redefine<00:01:22.190> the<00:01:22.610> 2d

00:01:22.870 --> 00:01:22.880 
stunts so we had to redefine the 2d

00:01:22.880 --> 00:01:25.000 
stunts so we had to redefine the 2d
navigation<00:01:23.480> of<00:01:23.600> Sam<00:01:23.780> the<00:01:23.990> 3d<00:01:24.350> navigation<00:01:24.440> of

00:01:25.000 --> 00:01:25.010 
navigation of Sam the 3d navigation of

00:01:25.010 --> 00:01:27.940 
navigation of Sam the 3d navigation of
Sam<00:01:25.250> to<00:01:25.640> make<00:01:25.790> it<00:01:25.910> more<00:01:26.090> fast<00:01:26.390> more<00:01:26.600> dynamic<00:01:27.260> we

00:01:27.940 --> 00:01:27.950 
Sam to make it more fast more dynamic we

00:01:27.950 --> 00:01:29.830 
Sam to make it more fast more dynamic we
also<00:01:28.100> worked<00:01:28.490> on<00:01:28.670> new<00:01:28.850> gameplay<00:01:29.270> rules<00:01:29.540> like

00:01:29.830 --> 00:01:29.840 
also worked on new gameplay rules like

00:01:29.840 --> 00:01:31.300 
also worked on new gameplay rules like
the<00:01:29.960> mark<00:01:30.170> and<00:01:30.290> execute<00:01:30.740> in<00:01:30.860> the<00:01:30.890> last-known

00:01:31.300 --> 00:01:31.310 
the mark and execute in the last-known

00:01:31.310 --> 00:01:33.610 
the mark and execute in the last-known
position<00:01:31.520> and<00:01:32.120> obviously<00:01:32.660> are<00:01:33.050> working<00:01:33.530> on

00:01:33.610 --> 00:01:33.620 
position and obviously are working on

00:01:33.620 --> 00:01:35.770 
position and obviously are working on
the<00:01:33.770> AI<00:01:33.920> to<00:01:34.070> embrace<00:01:34.670> all<00:01:34.940> those<00:01:35.120> systems<00:01:35.570> and

00:01:35.770 --> 00:01:35.780 
the AI to embrace all those systems and

00:01:35.780 --> 00:01:37.360 
the AI to embrace all those systems and
make<00:01:36.230> the<00:01:36.350> player<00:01:36.560> really<00:01:36.830> feel<00:01:37.160> like<00:01:37.340> a

00:01:37.360 --> 00:01:37.370 
make the player really feel like a

00:01:37.370 --> 00:01:39.700 
make the player really feel like a
predator<00:01:37.790> and<00:01:38.090> finally<00:01:38.990> we<00:01:39.200> had<00:01:39.290> to<00:01:39.440> tweak

00:01:39.700 --> 00:01:39.710 
predator and finally we had to tweak

00:01:39.710 --> 00:01:41.860 
predator and finally we had to tweak
balance<00:01:40.280> the<00:01:40.460> game<00:01:40.490> to<00:01:41.090> make<00:01:41.240> sure<00:01:41.450> that<00:01:41.630> it

00:01:41.860 --> 00:01:41.870 
balance the game to make sure that it

00:01:41.870 --> 00:01:43.690 
balance the game to make sure that it
really<00:01:42.110> worked<00:01:42.440> well<00:01:42.620> all<00:01:42.860> together<00:01:43.070> so<00:01:43.670> we

00:01:43.690 --> 00:01:43.700 
really worked well all together so we

00:01:43.700 --> 00:01:45.429 
really worked well all together so we
did<00:01:43.910> a<00:01:43.970> lot<00:01:44.150> of<00:01:44.330> play<00:01:44.540> tests

00:01:45.429 --> 00:01:45.439 
did a lot of play tests
