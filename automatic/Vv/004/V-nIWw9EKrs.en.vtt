well<00:02:54.620> and<00:02:55.040> a<00:02:56.350> map<00:02:57.350> loads<00:02:57.680> up<00:02:57.890> very<00:02:58.220> very<00:02:58.280> fast

00:02:58.690 --> 00:02:58.700 
well and a map loads up very very fast

00:02:58.700 --> 00:03:02.440 
well and a map loads up very very fast
on<00:02:58.940> it<00:02:59.230> on<00:03:00.230> black<00:03:00.470> ops<00:03:00.739> it<00:03:00.980> could<00:03:01.489> take<00:03:01.760> ages

00:03:02.440 --> 00:03:02.450 
on it on black ops it could take ages

00:03:02.450 --> 00:03:04.270 
on it on black ops it could take ages
before<00:03:02.690> when<00:03:03.110> when<00:03:03.410> you<00:03:03.500> finally<00:03:03.709> got<00:03:03.890> into<00:03:04.100> a

00:03:04.270 --> 00:03:04.280 
before when when you finally got into a

00:03:04.280 --> 00:03:06.100 
before when when you finally got into a
lobby<00:03:04.489> it<00:03:04.820> wasn't<00:03:05.180> a<00:03:05.239> problem<00:03:05.570> to<00:03:05.660> get<00:03:05.780> into<00:03:06.079> a

00:03:06.100 --> 00:03:06.110 
lobby it wasn't a problem to get into a

00:03:06.110 --> 00:03:08.710 
lobby it wasn't a problem to get into a
Nabi<00:03:06.380> but<00:03:06.920> when<00:03:07.220> the<00:03:07.400> map<00:03:07.880> where<00:03:08.150> the<00:03:08.450> game<00:03:08.570> was

00:03:08.710 --> 00:03:08.720 
Nabi but when the map where the game was

00:03:08.720 --> 00:03:11.080 
Nabi but when the map where the game was
supposed<00:03:09.079> to<00:03:09.140> start<00:03:09.350> it<00:03:09.829> took<00:03:10.130> forever<00:03:10.640> for<00:03:10.820> it

00:03:11.080 --> 00:03:11.090 
supposed to start it took forever for it

00:03:11.090 --> 00:03:14.430 
supposed to start it took forever for it
to<00:03:11.329> load<00:03:11.600> the<00:03:11.930> map<00:03:12.140> I<00:03:12.530> mean<00:03:13.100> it<00:03:13.280> was<00:03:13.519> out

00:03:14.430 --> 00:03:14.440 
to load the map I mean it was out

00:03:14.440 --> 00:03:17.229 
to load the map I mean it was out
unbearable<00:03:15.440> to<00:03:15.590> do<00:03:15.709> it<00:03:15.829> so<00:03:16.160> I<00:03:16.190> was<00:03:16.610> expecting

00:03:17.229 --> 00:03:17.239 
unbearable to do it so I was expecting

00:03:17.239 --> 00:03:21.520 
unbearable to do it so I was expecting
expecting<00:03:17.570> this<00:03:18.140> for<00:03:18.920> being<00:03:19.070> a<00:03:19.220> be<00:03:19.430> a<00:03:19.459> beta<00:03:20.530> and

00:03:21.520 --> 00:03:21.530 
expecting this for being a be a beta and

00:03:21.530 --> 00:03:25.330 
expecting this for being a be a beta and
not<00:03:21.680> being<00:03:21.920> a<00:03:22.010> fully<00:03:22.340> fledged<00:03:23.060> game<00:03:23.359> that<00:03:24.340> the

00:03:25.330 --> 00:03:25.340 
not being a fully fledged game that the

00:03:25.340 --> 00:03:28.690 
not being a fully fledged game that the
waiting<00:03:25.640> time<00:03:25.820> would<00:03:26.000> be<00:03:26.980> just<00:03:27.980> like<00:03:28.160> backups

00:03:28.690 --> 00:03:28.700 
waiting time would be just like backups

00:03:28.700 --> 00:03:31.479 
waiting time would be just like backups
or<00:03:28.880> even<00:03:29.269> worse<00:03:29.450> but<00:03:29.750> so<00:03:30.560> I<00:03:30.590> put<00:03:31.010> the<00:03:31.130> game<00:03:31.310> on

00:03:31.479 --> 00:03:31.489 
or even worse but so I put the game on

00:03:31.489 --> 00:03:34.060 
or even worse but so I put the game on
and<00:03:31.790> I<00:03:32.090> put<00:03:32.660> it<00:03:32.780> on<00:03:32.870> to<00:03:33.109> search<00:03:33.410> for<00:03:33.620> our<00:03:33.799> server

00:03:34.060 --> 00:03:34.070 
and I put it on to search for our server

00:03:34.070 --> 00:03:35.560 
and I put it on to search for our server
and<00:03:34.310> then<00:03:34.730> I<00:03:34.760> put<00:03:35.030> my<00:03:35.060> Vita

00:03:35.560 --> 00:03:35.570 
and then I put my Vita

00:03:35.570 --> 00:03:37.900 
and then I put my Vita
after<00:03:36.109> that<00:03:36.320> just<00:03:36.709> like<00:03:36.920> a<00:03:36.950> minute<00:03:37.340> later<00:03:37.609> I

00:03:49.180 --> 00:03:49.190 
you can see photographers I'm using a

00:03:49.190 --> 00:03:51.420 
you can see photographers I'm using a
Sony<00:03:49.459> a<00:03:49.670> 5/5

00:03:51.420 --> 00:03:51.430 
Sony a 5/5

00:03:51.430 --> 00:03:54.120 
Sony a 5/5
a<00:03:51.460> DSLR<00:03:52.240> camera<00:03:52.900> right<00:03:53.230> now<00:03:53.380> to<00:03:53.440> record<00:03:53.920> this

00:03:54.120 --> 00:03:54.130 
a DSLR camera right now to record this

00:03:54.130 --> 00:03:58.800 
a DSLR camera right now to record this
and<00:03:56.010> it<00:03:57.010> doesn't<00:03:57.370> really<00:03:57.700> do<00:03:57.940> became<00:03:58.270> justice

00:03:58.800 --> 00:03:58.810 
and it doesn't really do became justice

00:03:58.810 --> 00:04:01.350 
and it doesn't really do became justice
even<00:03:59.410> even<00:03:59.980> if<00:04:00.100> it<00:04:00.250> this<00:04:00.700> is<00:04:00.820> a<00:04:00.850> very<00:04:01.180> good

00:04:01.350 --> 00:04:01.360 
even even if it this is a very good

00:04:01.360 --> 00:04:02.970 
even even if it this is a very good
camera<00:04:01.750> it<00:04:01.810> doesn't<00:04:01.960> really<00:04:02.290> really<00:04:02.620> do<00:04:02.740> the

00:04:02.970 --> 00:04:02.980 
camera it doesn't really really do the

00:04:02.980 --> 00:04:04.950 
camera it doesn't really really do the
game<00:04:03.130> justice<00:04:03.490> because<00:04:03.790> it<00:04:04.240> really<00:04:04.720> looks

00:04:04.950 --> 00:04:04.960 
game justice because it really looks

00:04:04.960 --> 00:04:07.050 
game justice because it really looks
amazing<00:04:05.170> when<00:04:05.740> you<00:04:05.830> look<00:04:05.860> when<00:04:06.610> you<00:04:06.700> have<00:04:06.760> it
