00:00:08.889 --> 00:00:11.660
 Hello 

00:00:10.100 --> 00:00:13.250
 today we are at Ana's house sheila 

00:00:11.660 --> 00:00:14.719
 in appearance of goiÃ¢nia 

00:00:13.250 --> 00:00:17.180
 we will see everything the architect 

00:00:14.719 --> 00:00:18.740
 jefferson castro did to transform the 

00:00:17.180 --> 00:00:20.539
 balcony of the entrance of the house in a 

00:00:18.740 --> 00:00:32.870
 very cozy and full of 

00:00:20.539 --> 00:00:35.480
 leather in colors mainly with 

00:00:32.870 --> 00:00:37.160
 relation to the taste of the client when 

00:00:35.480 --> 00:00:39.530
 talk she said so to me it 's easy 

00:00:37.160 --> 00:00:43.190
 I live on the beach, I really like 

00:00:39.530 --> 00:00:45.080
 colors and look I love sea color blue 

00:00:43.190 --> 00:00:47.030
 We are in GoiÃ¢nia, of course. 

00:00:45.080 --> 00:00:49.820
 but I want to bring some 

00:00:47.030 --> 00:00:51.530
 What she remembers is her inheritance. 

00:00:49.820 --> 00:00:52.910
 of childhood then I'll bring this 

00:00:51.530 --> 00:00:56.150
 for her project 

00:00:52.910 --> 00:00:58.370
 So we took advantage of this fund and 

00:00:56.150 --> 00:01:01.340
 balanced with other colors like 

00:00:58.370 --> 00:01:03.800
 red pink or lilac 

00:01:01.340 --> 00:01:05.420
 this is the front porch of the house then 

00:01:03.800 --> 00:01:07.909
 here would be the welcome card 

00:01:05.420 --> 00:01:10.810
 the house was more or less in that sense 

00:01:07.909 --> 00:01:10.810
 that I thought of the colors 

00:01:16.350 --> 00:01:21.450
 I've always liked plants and 

00:01:19.080 --> 00:01:23.070
 my mother when we were little 

00:01:21.450 --> 00:01:25.380
 lived in a very large house had a 

00:01:23.070 --> 00:01:27.150
 large yard full of plants then 

00:01:25.380 --> 00:01:29.130
 Ever since I was little, I think it's great. 

00:01:27.150 --> 00:01:30.840
 to take care of the plants, right? 

00:01:29.130 --> 00:01:33.409
 and I would like to be going through 

00:01:30.840 --> 00:01:33.409
 boys too 

00:01:35.490 --> 00:01:39.509
 6 

00:01:36.990 --> 00:01:42.659
 how you feel at the end will give 

00:01:39.509 --> 00:01:44.520
 now insist on super at ease 

00:01:42.659 --> 00:01:47.340
 are themes that became very cozy 

00:01:44.520 --> 00:01:49.259
 stayed a very good place well ventilated 

00:01:47.340 --> 00:01:51.960
 night at night looks very beautiful 

00:01:49.259 --> 00:01:54.149
 It's a question of clarity and it 

00:01:51.960 --> 00:01:57.950
 fresh team owner as much as the 

00:01:54.149 --> 00:01:57.950
 children we spend getting
