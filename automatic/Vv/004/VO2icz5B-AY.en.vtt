 Hello! in this video tutorial I will teach how to weave a crochet ring 

00:00:17.820 --> 00:00:21.140
 There are 3 ways to weave a ring 

00:00:21.140 --> 00:00:25.069
 I'm going to teach one of them here 

00:00:25.069 --> 00:00:30.429
 I'm going to show you how to weave a double ring 

00:00:30.429 --> 00:00:33.620
 let's place the wool on 

00:00:33.620 --> 00:00:38.020
 the finger and let's do 1 

00:00:38.020 --> 00:00:44.330
 and 2 turns, that is, this is the double ring 

00:00:44.330 --> 00:00:45.770
 we introduce 

00:00:45.770 --> 00:00:50.240
 the needle 

00:00:50.240 --> 00:00:57.240
 we take it out of the finger 

00:00:59.280 --> 00:01:03.870
 and we make 1 chain 

00:01:03.870 --> 00:01:05.600
 to adjust 

00:01:05.600 --> 00:01:09.050
 and then we're going to weave in this case 

00:01:09.050 --> 00:01:14.740
 in high point, that is, I'm going to weave 3 chains first to replace 

00:01:14.740 --> 00:01:16.720
 the first high point 

00:01:16.720 --> 00:01:18.270
 and later 

00:01:18.270 --> 00:01:20.790
 inside the ring 

00:01:20.790 --> 00:01:25.090
 I will continue weaving 

00:01:25.090 --> 00:01:30.020
 in high point 

00:01:30.020 --> 00:01:36.730
 This double ring is used just for knitting 

00:01:36.730 --> 00:01:42.060
 in high point 

00:01:42.060 --> 00:01:45.150
 in this way we weave 

00:01:45.150 --> 00:01:48.260
 so many points 

00:01:48.260 --> 00:01:51.350
 as requested 

00:01:51.350 --> 00:01:58.350
 in the patterns 

00:02:15.269 --> 00:02:19.609
 let's suppose they ask us 

00:02:19.609 --> 00:02:21.769
 10 points 

00:02:21.769 --> 00:02:28.769
 let's go for the seventh 

00:02:30.739 --> 00:02:36.129
 by the eighth 

00:02:36.129 --> 00:02:43.129
 for the ninth 

00:02:43.869 --> 00:02:50.159
 and for the tenth 

00:02:50.159 --> 00:02:51.769
 how we close 

00:02:51.769 --> 00:02:54.599
 the circle weaving 

00:02:54.599 --> 00:03:01.599
 1 satin stitch in the third string, that is, here 

00:03:03.509 --> 00:03:06.609
 thus 

00:03:06.609 --> 00:03:11.909
 always remember to adjust by pulling this strand 

00:03:11.909 --> 00:03:14.649
 we adjust 

00:03:14.649 --> 00:03:17.569
 and we have the circle 

00:03:17.569 --> 00:03:21.500
 woven on a double ring 

00:03:25.789 --> 00:03:30.100
