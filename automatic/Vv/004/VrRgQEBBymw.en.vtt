a<00:02:01.229> lot<00:02:01.259> of<00:02:01.469> the<00:02:01.680> time<00:02:01.890> of<00:02:02.130> the<00:02:02.219> enemy<00:02:02.430> carries

00:02:02.690 --> 00:02:02.700 
a lot of the time of the enemy carries

00:02:02.700 --> 00:02:04.490 
a lot of the time of the enemy carries
now<00:02:03.030> given<00:02:03.390> that<00:02:03.420> we've<00:02:03.630> only<00:02:03.780> seen<00:02:04.110> the<00:02:04.469> one

00:02:04.490 --> 00:02:04.500 
now given that we've only seen the one

00:02:04.500 --> 00:02:07.490 
now given that we've only seen the one
game<00:02:04.950> from<00:02:05.189> them<00:02:05.369> so<00:02:05.610> far<00:02:05.939> if<00:02:06.810> we<00:02:07.020> were<00:02:07.140> to<00:02:07.259> look

00:02:07.490 --> 00:02:07.500 
game from them so far if we were to look

00:02:07.500 --> 00:02:09.710 
game from them so far if we were to look
for<00:02:07.890> points<00:02:08.550> of<00:02:08.610> improvement<00:02:09.179> things<00:02:09.390> that<00:02:09.629> we

00:02:09.710 --> 00:02:09.720 
for points of improvement things that we

00:02:09.720 --> 00:02:11.630 
for points of improvement things that we
think<00:02:09.959> immediately<00:02:10.379> initially<00:02:11.099> off<00:02:11.250> the<00:02:11.430> bat

00:02:11.630 --> 00:02:11.640 
think immediately initially off the bat

00:02:11.640 --> 00:02:13.610 
think immediately initially off the bat
we<00:02:12.030> definitely<00:02:12.300> want<00:02:12.690> them<00:02:12.870> to<00:02:13.080> work<00:02:13.290> on

00:02:13.610 --> 00:02:13.620 
we definitely want them to work on

00:02:13.620 --> 00:02:15.410 
we definitely want them to work on
and<00:02:13.680> moving<00:02:14.129> forward<00:02:14.640> what<00:02:15.000> would<00:02:15.120> they<00:02:15.239> be

00:02:15.410 --> 00:02:15.420 
and moving forward what would they be

00:02:15.420 --> 00:02:18.680 
and moving forward what would they be
looking<00:02:16.190> at<00:02:17.190> TDK<00:02:17.670> it's<00:02:17.940> always<00:02:18.299> kind<00:02:18.540> of<00:02:18.569> like

00:02:18.680 --> 00:02:18.690

00:02:18.690 --> 00:02:20.270 
looking at TDK it's always kind of like
a<00:02:18.720> communication<00:02:19.440> thing<00:02:19.620> I<00:02:19.830> feel<00:02:20.159> like
