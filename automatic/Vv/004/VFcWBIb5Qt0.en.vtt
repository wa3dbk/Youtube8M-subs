00:00:01.939 --> 00:00:08.920
 hi how about this is a video of how 

00:00:04.730 --> 00:00:11.059
 transform your usb memory to ram 

00:00:08.920 --> 00:00:17.139
 this way will it serve that for 

00:00:11.059 --> 00:00:17.139
 increase me for example I'm using 2 

00:00:17.800 --> 00:00:25.760
 but how 

00:00:20.900 --> 00:00:25.760
 the first thing is to insert your usb memory 

00:00:26.190 --> 00:00:31.550
 the uncertain and they go here points 

00:00:29.240 --> 00:00:32.500
 in a very easy way and in a team is 

00:00:31.550 --> 00:00:35.400
 account 

00:00:32.500 --> 00:00:38.290
 by the warehouse control 

00:00:35.400 --> 00:00:40.370
 windows is more in this way they are 

00:00:38.290 --> 00:00:45.050
 let's instruct 

00:00:40.370 --> 00:00:50.510
 we are going to select that they are 4 gigas in 

00:00:45.050 --> 00:00:53.120
 forward we go to 7 points in total is 

00:00:50.510 --> 00:00:55.790
 8 gigas but I'll be 

00:00:53.120 --> 00:00:57.620
 we are not going to use 7.22 gigabytes 

00:00:55.790 --> 00:01:00.110
 ok what are we going to go 

00:00:57.620 --> 00:01:04.129
 select it right click and go 

00:01:00.110 --> 00:01:07.369
 to go to properties and here in properties 

00:01:04.129 --> 00:01:11.090
 we're going to the unit where it says ray 

00:01:07.369 --> 00:01:13.460
 burse ok here it will seem to me to use 

00:01:11.090 --> 00:01:15.619
 this device what we are going to 

00:01:13.460 --> 00:01:17.899
 do is put the device because if 

00:01:15.619 --> 00:01:19.310
 we can dedicate this device if 

00:01:17.899 --> 00:01:21.770
 memory only goes 

00:01:19.310 --> 00:01:24.350
 permanently going to serve for this I 

00:01:21.770 --> 00:01:26.899
 I do not work to save anything and so we are going to 

00:01:24.350 --> 00:01:28.399
 use using this device can 

00:01:26.899 --> 00:01:30.409
 put your positive that even 

00:01:28.399 --> 00:01:33.429
 will appear if we are going to put the amount 

00:01:30.409 --> 00:01:33.429
 maximum that can be done 

00:01:34.440 --> 00:01:49.140
 so apply your windows configured 

00:01:46.140 --> 00:01:49.140
 windows 

00:01:56.750 --> 00:02:00.620
 lost we continue to be worth 

00:02:03.770 --> 00:02:16.940
 and so we go booting 

00:02:19.670 --> 00:02:22.670
 processors 

00:02:27.010 --> 00:02:36.520
 and accept it let's go to another team 

00:02:34.910 --> 00:02:39.520
 let's take a step blank 

00:02:36.520 --> 00:02:39.520
 properties 

00:02:40.430 --> 00:02:46.030
 well we already gave in more properties 

00:02:46.420 --> 00:02:51.180
 properties 

00:02:48.480 --> 00:02:53.790
 and let's go to says configuration 

00:02:51.180 --> 00:02:56.900
 advanced in the system we give you a click 

00:02:53.790 --> 00:02:56.900
 we are going to 

00:02:58.349 --> 00:03:04.180
 advanced options will all go here that 

00:03:02.379 --> 00:03:06.370
 visual performance is programming the 

00:03:04.180 --> 00:03:09.599
 virtual memory processor 

00:03:06.370 --> 00:03:09.599
 we are configuration 

00:03:09.610 --> 00:03:15.260
 we are going to advanced 

00:03:13.100 --> 00:03:17.630
 let's change 

00:03:15.260 --> 00:03:21.860
 here we are similar 

00:03:17.630 --> 00:03:25.810
 let's uncheck this let's give 

00:03:21.860 --> 00:03:25.810
 as system administered 

00:03:26.130 --> 00:03:29.810
 custom size 

00:03:31.880 --> 00:03:35.210
 16 mb 

00:03:36.170 --> 00:03:41.120
 let's put this is recommended let's go 

00:03:39.300 --> 00:03:43.340
 to put it here 

00:03:41.120 --> 00:03:47.230
 and three 

00:03:43.340 --> 00:03:47.230
 three thousand 230 points 

00:03:49.490 --> 00:03:57.230
 so mentally let's put it here 

00:03:53.520 --> 00:03:57.230
 of 2,456 

00:03:58.260 --> 00:04:02.000
 let's put him to accept 

00:04:03.560 --> 00:04:08.810
 to accept 

00:04:06.200 --> 00:04:11.599
 and we close once doing this we have 

00:04:08.810 --> 00:04:13.170
 to organize our pc but a great 

00:04:11.599 --> 00:04:15.630
 change 

00:04:13.170 --> 00:04:17.660
 but well I hope that this has 

00:04:15.630 --> 00:04:17.660
 liked 

00:04:17.799 --> 00:04:21.690
 if I look for them up to the moment 

00:04:19.269 --> 00:04:21.690
 next
