to notice is the ground seat notice it's
a<00:00:22.020> smooth<00:00:22.439> even<00:00:22.910> curvature<00:00:23.910> all<00:00:24.180> the<00:00:24.510> way<00:00:24.660> down

00:00:25.210 --> 00:00:25.220 
a smooth even curvature all the way down

00:00:25.220 --> 00:00:27.830 
a smooth even curvature all the way down
noticed<00:00:26.220> it's<00:00:26.400> really<00:00:26.789> high<00:00:27.029> right<00:00:27.330> here<00:00:27.660> and

00:00:27.830 --> 00:00:27.840 
noticed it's really high right here and

noticed it's really high right here and
a<00:00:28.439> smooth<00:00:28.800> downward<00:00:29.460> slope<00:00:29.820> right<00:00:30.810> in<00:00:30.990> here

00:00:31.339 --> 00:00:31.349 
a smooth downward slope right in here

00:00:31.349 --> 00:00:34.010 
a smooth downward slope right in here
it's<00:00:31.590> flat<00:00:31.949> but<00:00:32.250> only<00:00:32.759> for<00:00:32.969> just<00:00:33.120> about<00:00:33.750> that

00:00:34.010 --> 00:00:34.020 
it's flat but only for just about that

it's flat but only for just about that
wide<00:00:34.290> and<00:00:34.559> then<00:00:35.280> it<00:00:35.430> starts<00:00:35.790> to<00:00:35.910> make<00:00:36.090> a<00:00:36.120> nice

00:00:36.410 --> 00:00:36.420 
wide and then it starts to make a nice

00:00:36.420 --> 00:00:39.560 
wide and then it starts to make a nice
smooth<00:00:36.809> curve<00:00:37.110> up<00:00:37.440> a<00:00:37.739> lot<00:00:38.309> of<00:00:38.460> saddles<00:00:38.879> they

00:00:39.560 --> 00:00:39.570 
smooth curve up a lot of saddles they

00:00:39.570 --> 00:00:41.510 
smooth curve up a lot of saddles they
won't<00:00:39.840> have<00:00:40.020> this<00:00:40.260> rise<00:00:40.530> in<00:00:40.920> them<00:00:41.070> right<00:00:41.219> here

00:00:41.510 --> 00:00:41.520 
won't have this rise in them right here

00:00:41.520 --> 00:00:46.580 
won't have this rise in them right here
and<00:00:42.920> it<00:00:43.920> it<00:00:44.520> doesn't<00:00:44.969> support<00:00:45.390> the<00:00:45.960> front<00:00:46.289> end

00:00:46.580 --> 00:00:46.590 
and it it doesn't support the front end

00:00:46.590 --> 00:00:49.459 
and it it doesn't support the front end
of<00:00:46.860> your<00:00:46.920> I<00:00:47.520> guess<00:00:47.789> your<00:00:48.180> pelvis<00:00:48.690> or<00:00:49.020> for<00:00:49.350> lack

00:00:49.459 --> 00:00:49.469 
of your I guess your pelvis or for lack

00:00:49.469 --> 00:00:51.889 
of your I guess your pelvis or for lack
of<00:00:49.530> a<00:00:49.770> better<00:00:49.800> word<00:00:50.190> your<00:00:50.399> crotch<00:00:50.700> and<00:00:51.000> all

of a better word your crotch and all
this<00:00:52.140> is<00:00:52.410> just<00:00:52.649> kind<00:00:52.860> of<00:00:52.980> empty<00:00:53.340> space<00:00:53.670> well

00:00:53.930 --> 00:00:53.940 
this is just kind of empty space well

00:00:53.940 --> 00:00:56.540 
this is just kind of empty space well
with<00:00:54.090> having<00:00:54.239> this<00:00:54.600> ground<00:00:54.930> seat<00:00:55.260> that<00:00:55.920> Rises

00:00:56.540 --> 00:00:56.550 
with having this ground seat that Rises

00:00:56.550 --> 00:01:00.410 
with having this ground seat that Rises
it<00:00:57.449> makes<00:00:58.289> it<00:00:58.590> to<00:00:58.739> where<00:00:58.770> this<00:00:59.280> seat<00:00:59.609> conforms

00:01:00.410 --> 00:01:00.420 
it makes it to where this seat conforms

00:01:00.420 --> 00:01:04.429 
it makes it to where this seat conforms
to<00:01:00.739> your<00:01:01.739> whole<00:01:02.039> entire<00:01:02.570> body<00:01:03.570> not<00:01:03.809> just<00:01:04.019> your

00:01:06.950 --> 00:01:06.960 
tailbone you look at a lot of saddles

00:01:06.960 --> 00:01:08.690 
tailbone you look at a lot of saddles
and<00:01:07.140> they'll<00:01:07.320> be<00:01:07.470> curved<00:01:07.830> a<00:01:08.010> little<00:01:08.280> bit<00:01:08.460> and

00:01:08.690 --> 00:01:08.700 
and they'll be curved a little bit and

00:01:08.700 --> 00:01:10.250 
and they'll be curved a little bit and
then<00:01:08.939> they'll<00:01:09.119> have<00:01:09.270> a<00:01:09.330> little<00:01:09.689> bit<00:01:09.840> of<00:01:09.960> a<00:01:10.049> rise

00:01:10.250 --> 00:01:10.260 
then they'll have a little bit of a rise

00:01:10.260 --> 00:01:12.710 
then they'll have a little bit of a rise
but<00:01:11.220> for<00:01:11.430> the<00:01:11.520> most<00:01:11.700> part<00:01:11.820> they're<00:01:12.210> just<00:01:12.450> flat

00:01:12.710 --> 00:01:12.720 
but for the most part they're just flat

00:01:12.720 --> 00:01:15.469 
but for the most part they're just flat
all<00:01:13.049> the<00:01:13.080> way<00:01:13.200> across<00:01:13.560> there<00:01:13.920> and<00:01:14.180> when<00:01:15.180> I<00:01:15.210> say

00:01:15.469 --> 00:01:15.479 
all the way across there and when I say

00:01:15.479 --> 00:01:17.870 
all the way across there and when I say
ground<00:01:15.810> seat<00:01:16.140> what<00:01:16.409> it<00:01:16.560> is<00:01:16.710> is<00:01:16.950> if<00:01:17.100> I<00:01:17.250> was<00:01:17.430> to<00:01:17.460> if

00:01:17.870 --> 00:01:17.880 
ground seat what it is is if I was to if

00:01:17.880 --> 00:01:22.310 
ground seat what it is is if I was to if
I<00:01:18.270> was<00:01:18.450> to<00:01:20.060> undo<00:01:21.060> these<00:01:21.360> strings<00:01:21.840> and<00:01:22.140> tear

00:01:22.310 --> 00:01:22.320

you would see is a bunch of pieces of
leather<00:01:29.430> that<00:01:29.790> have<00:01:29.880> been<00:01:30.060> stacked<00:01:30.420> and<00:01:30.750> built

00:01:30.980 --> 00:01:30.990 
leather that have been stacked and built

00:01:30.990 --> 00:01:34.010 
leather that have been stacked and built
up<00:01:31.229> and<00:01:31.470> then<00:01:31.770> shaved<00:01:32.130> back<00:01:32.490> down<00:01:32.759> to<00:01:33.540> get<00:01:33.720> this

00:01:34.010 --> 00:01:34.020 
up and then shaved back down to get this

00:01:34.020 --> 00:01:36.740 
up and then shaved back down to get this
kind<00:01:34.290> of<00:01:34.439> shape<00:01:34.909> that's<00:01:35.909> your<00:01:36.150> ground<00:01:36.420> seat

00:01:36.740 --> 00:01:36.750 
kind of shape that's your ground seat

00:01:36.750 --> 00:01:41.270 
kind of shape that's your ground seat
and<00:01:38.030> look<00:01:39.030> at<00:01:39.180> it<00:01:39.270> like<00:01:39.420> this<00:01:39.740> the<00:01:40.740> tree<00:01:41.070> is

00:01:41.270 --> 00:01:41.280 
and look at it like this the tree is

00:01:41.280 --> 00:01:43.399 
and look at it like this the tree is
really<00:01:41.939> important<00:01:42.600> for<00:01:42.840> the<00:01:42.960> fit<00:01:43.170> of<00:01:43.290> the

00:01:43.399 --> 00:01:43.409 
really important for the fit of the

00:01:43.409 --> 00:01:45.499 
really important for the fit of the
horse<00:01:43.710> the<00:01:44.009> ground<00:01:44.549> seat<00:01:44.909> is<00:01:45.119> really

00:01:45.499 --> 00:01:45.509 
horse the ground seat is really

00:01:45.509 --> 00:01:48.289 
horse the ground seat is really
important<00:01:45.960> for<00:01:46.470> the<00:01:46.590> fit<00:01:46.799> of<00:01:46.829> a<00:01:47.009> rider<00:01:47.299> but

00:01:48.289 --> 00:01:48.299 
important for the fit of a rider but

00:01:48.299 --> 00:01:50.569 
important for the fit of a rider but
what<00:01:48.930> makes<00:01:49.170> a<00:01:49.380> saddle<00:01:49.829> really<00:01:50.130> good<00:01:50.369> is

00:01:50.569 --> 00:01:50.579 
what makes a saddle really good is

00:01:50.579 --> 00:01:52.460 
what makes a saddle really good is
having<00:01:50.790> a<00:01:51.030> good<00:01:51.270> tree<00:01:51.600> and<00:01:51.869> having<00:01:52.200> a<00:01:52.290> good
