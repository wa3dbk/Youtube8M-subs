okay<00:01:51.930> so<00:01:52.409> he's<00:01:52.710> pretty<00:01:52.829> much<00:01:52.950> letting<00:01:53.250> itself

00:01:53.480 --> 00:01:53.490 
okay so he's pretty much letting itself

00:01:53.490 --> 00:01:55.429 
okay so he's pretty much letting itself
lose<00:01:53.790> to<00:01:54.000> figure<00:01:54.240> out<00:01:54.420> the<00:01:54.689> moves<00:01:55.110> and

00:01:55.429 --> 00:01:55.439 
lose to figure out the moves and

00:01:55.439 --> 00:01:58.160 
lose to figure out the moves and
abilities<00:01:55.530> of<00:01:56.250> his<00:01:56.670> opponent<00:01:57.240> and<00:01:57.509> I<00:01:57.840> like<00:01:58.049> the

00:01:58.160 --> 00:01:58.170 
abilities of his opponent and I like the

00:01:58.170 --> 00:01:59.660 
abilities of his opponent and I like the
way<00:01:58.290> that<00:01:58.500> was<00:01:58.590> demonstrated<00:01:59.189> showing<00:01:59.490> how

00:01:59.660 --> 00:01:59.670 
way that was demonstrated showing how

00:01:59.670 --> 00:02:02.330 
way that was demonstrated showing how
Kouga<00:02:00.090> as<00:02:00.240> a<00:02:00.270> fire<00:02:00.719> he's<00:02:01.259> very<00:02:01.500> intelligent<00:02:01.920> he

00:02:02.330 --> 00:02:02.340 
Kouga as a fire he's very intelligent he

00:02:02.340 --> 00:02:03.830 
Kouga as a fire he's very intelligent he
thinks<00:02:02.640> about<00:02:02.790> different<00:02:03.149> tactics<00:02:03.540> of<00:02:03.659> how<00:02:03.780> he

00:02:03.830 --> 00:02:03.840 
thinks about different tactics of how he

00:02:03.840 --> 00:02:05.690 
thinks about different tactics of how he
can<00:02:04.079> out<00:02:04.259> think<00:02:04.560> his<00:02:04.649> opponent<00:02:05.159> and<00:02:05.250> how<00:02:05.640> he

00:02:05.690 --> 00:02:05.700 
can out think his opponent and how he

00:02:05.700 --> 00:02:08.029 
can out think his opponent and how he
can<00:02:05.969> crush<00:02:06.240> their<00:02:06.540> morale<00:02:07.140> or<00:02:07.469> spirit<00:02:07.920> like

00:02:08.029 --> 00:02:08.039 
can crush their morale or spirit like

00:02:08.039 --> 00:02:10.460 
can crush their morale or spirit like
that's<00:02:08.220> exactly<00:02:08.369> what<00:02:09.060> Kouga<00:02:09.840> did<00:02:10.050> in<00:02:10.319> the

00:02:10.460 --> 00:02:10.470 
that's exactly what Kouga did in the

00:02:10.470 --> 00:02:12.350 
that's exactly what Kouga did in the
fight<00:02:10.679> he<00:02:10.860> crushed<00:02:11.250> his<00:02:11.400> opponents<00:02:11.970> spirit

00:02:12.350 --> 00:02:12.360

00:02:13.110 --> 00:02:15.440 
and

00:02:54.080 --> 00:02:54.090 
been a beat one of the top elites and

00:02:54.090 --> 00:02:56.990 
been a beat one of the top elites and
porter<00:02:54.870> and<00:02:55.320> he's<00:02:55.709> at<00:02:55.860> see<00:02:56.040> rank<00:02:56.280> so<00:02:56.670> yeah

00:02:56.990 --> 00:02:57.000 
porter and he's at see rank so yeah

00:02:57.000 --> 00:02:58.729 
porter and he's at see rank so yeah
that's<00:02:57.270> pretty<00:02:57.570> freakin<00:02:58.140> impressive<00:02:58.530> I<00:02:58.560> mean

00:02:58.729 --> 00:02:58.739 
that's pretty freakin impressive I mean

00:02:58.739 --> 00:02:59.960 
that's pretty freakin impressive I mean
I<00:02:58.770> highly<00:02:59.130> doubt<00:02:59.280> he<00:02:59.459> could<00:02:59.550> beat<00:02:59.700> someone

00:02:59.960 --> 00:02:59.970 
I highly doubt he could beat someone

00:02:59.970 --> 00:03:01.910 
I highly doubt he could beat someone
like<00:03:00.000> Jin<00:03:00.390> I<00:03:00.420> mean<00:03:00.750> it's<00:03:01.170> already<00:03:01.380> obviously

00:03:01.910 --> 00:03:01.920 
like Jin I mean it's already obviously

00:03:01.920 --> 00:03:02.690 
like Jin I mean it's already obviously
wouldn't<00:03:02.100> be<00:03:02.160> able<00:03:02.310> to<00:03:02.370> beat<00:03:02.459> someone<00:03:02.610> like

00:03:02.690 --> 00:03:02.700 
wouldn't be able to beat someone like

00:03:02.700 --> 00:03:05.000 
wouldn't be able to beat someone like
Jin<00:03:03.030> but<00:03:03.600> it's<00:03:04.320> still<00:03:04.500> the<00:03:04.620> point

00:03:05.000 --> 00:03:05.010 
Jin but it's still the point

00:03:05.010 --> 00:03:07.430 
Jin but it's still the point
