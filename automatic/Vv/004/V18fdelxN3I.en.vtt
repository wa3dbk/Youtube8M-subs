00:00:40.700 --> 00:00:40.710 
here you're partnered so it was really

00:00:40.710 --> 00:00:42.979 
here you're partnered so it was really

00:00:42.979 --> 00:00:42.989 
awesome and they have some some

00:00:42.989 --> 00:00:46.670 
awesome and they have some some
downsides<00:00:43.530> though<00:00:43.680> for<00:00:44.550> example<00:00:44.969> you<00:00:45.680> the

00:00:46.670 --> 00:00:46.680 
downsides though for example you the

00:00:46.680 --> 00:00:48.770 
downsides though for example you the
contract<00:00:46.950> lost<00:00:47.280> two<00:00:47.820> years<00:00:48.120> and<00:00:48.390> you<00:00:48.600> can

00:00:48.770 --> 00:00:48.780 
contract lost two years and you can

00:00:48.780 --> 00:00:52.400 
contract lost two years and you can
there<00:00:48.989> isn't<00:00:49.559> really<00:00:49.649> a<00:00:49.800> way<00:00:49.980> to<00:00:50.539> to<00:00:51.539> leave<00:00:51.780> the

00:00:52.400 --> 00:00:52.410 
there isn't really a way to to leave the

00:00:52.410 --> 00:00:54.139 
there isn't really a way to to leave the
network<00:00:52.710> or<00:00:52.949> to<00:00:53.100> cancel<00:00:53.550> the<00:00:53.640> contracts

00:00:54.139 --> 00:00:54.149 
network or to cancel the contracts

00:00:54.149 --> 00:00:56.689 
network or to cancel the contracts
before<00:00:54.420> those<00:00:54.809> two<00:00:54.840> years<00:00:55.320> then<00:00:56.219> also<00:00:56.430> another

00:00:56.689 --> 00:00:56.699 
before those two years then also another

00:00:56.699 --> 00:01:00.049 
before those two years then also another
downside<00:00:56.969> is<00:00:57.360> that<00:00:57.390> you<00:00:57.770> only<00:00:58.770> get<00:00:58.980> paid<00:00:59.399> once

00:01:00.049 --> 00:01:00.059 
downside is that you only get paid once

00:01:00.059 --> 00:01:02.840 
downside is that you only get paid once
you've<00:01:00.300> reached<00:01:00.539> $100<00:01:01.530> so<00:01:01.980> when<00:01:02.550> they<00:01:02.670> owe<00:01:02.699> you

00:01:02.840 --> 00:01:02.850 
you've reached $100 so when they owe you

00:01:02.850 --> 00:01:04.880 
you've reached $100 so when they owe you
one<00:01:03.420> dollar<00:01:03.840> then<00:01:04.110> they<00:01:04.229> will<00:01:04.379> send<00:01:04.619> it<00:01:04.739> to<00:01:04.769> you

00:01:04.880 --> 00:01:04.890 
one dollar then they will send it to you

00:01:04.890 --> 00:01:07.850 
one dollar then they will send it to you
but<00:01:05.460> not<00:01:05.580> before<00:01:05.760> that<00:01:06.380> but<00:01:07.380> I<00:01:07.409> don't<00:01:07.740> really

00:01:07.850 --> 00:01:07.860 
but not before that but I don't really

00:01:07.860 --> 00:01:10.460 
but not before that but I don't really
care<00:01:08.130> because<00:01:08.250> I<00:01:08.640> mean<00:01:09.570> we<00:01:09.780> do<00:01:09.840> not<00:01:09.990> refuse<00:01:10.260> I

00:01:10.460 --> 00:01:10.470 
care because I mean we do not refuse I

00:01:10.470 --> 00:01:12.410 
care because I mean we do not refuse I
gets<00:01:10.740> I<00:01:10.950> will<00:01:11.130> never<00:01:11.340> really<00:01:11.909> reach<00:01:12.119> one

00:01:12.410 --> 00:01:12.420 
gets I will never really reach one

00:01:12.420 --> 00:01:14.330 
gets I will never really reach one
hundred<00:01:12.750> dollars<00:01:13.080> i<00:01:13.229> mean<00:01:13.260> I<00:01:13.530> a<00:01:13.560> little

00:01:14.330 --> 00:01:14.340 
hundred dollars i mean I a little

00:01:14.340 --> 00:01:17.749 
hundred dollars i mean I a little
calculating<00:01:15.060> em<00:01:15.240> um<00:01:15.930> I<00:01:16.860> figured<00:01:17.400> out<00:01:17.490> that<00:01:17.640> it

00:01:17.749 --> 00:01:17.759 
calculating em um I figured out that it

00:01:17.759 --> 00:01:20.270 
calculating em um I figured out that it
will<00:01:17.970> take<00:01:18.210> me<00:01:18.390> 15<00:01:19.080> months<00:01:19.680> in<00:01:19.830> reach<00:01:19.979> one

00:01:20.270 --> 00:01:20.280 
will take me 15 months in reach one

00:01:20.280 --> 00:01:23.690 
will take me 15 months in reach one
hundred<00:01:21.000> dollars<00:01:21.869> with<00:01:22.170> the<00:01:22.409> long<00:01:23.159> fuse<00:01:23.460> I<00:01:23.549> now

00:01:23.690 --> 00:01:23.700 
hundred dollars with the long fuse I now

00:01:23.700 --> 00:01:26.120 
hundred dollars with the long fuse I now
get<00:01:23.970> so<00:01:24.960> that's<00:01:25.170> four<00:01:25.500> years<00:01:25.530> and<00:01:25.920> two<00:01:26.100> months

00:01:26.120 --> 00:01:26.130 
get so that's four years and two months

00:01:26.130 --> 00:01:28.340 
get so that's four years and two months
so<00:01:26.580> that's<00:01:26.670> pretty<00:01:26.909> crazy<00:01:27.240> but<00:01:27.930> I<00:01:27.960> don't

00:01:28.340 --> 00:01:28.350 
so that's pretty crazy but I don't

00:01:28.350 --> 00:01:30.499 
so that's pretty crazy but I don't
really<00:01:28.530> do<00:01:28.829> it<00:01:28.920> for<00:01:28.979> the<00:01:29.250> money<00:01:29.280> the<00:01:30.240> reason

00:01:30.499 --> 00:01:30.509 
really do it for the money the reason

00:01:30.509 --> 00:01:32.300
