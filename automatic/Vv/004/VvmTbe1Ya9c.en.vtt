 but it happens then I want you 

00:01:17.140 --> 00:01:23.760
 say we make a dish that 

00:01:18.940 --> 00:01:28.030
 executes code in some sense like 

00:01:23.760 --> 00:01:29.350
 guitar baba is not real guitar 

00:01:28.030 --> 00:01:33.400
 this is a pan 

00:01:29.350 --> 00:01:35.410
 in my recipe everything is exactly the same 

00:01:33.400 --> 00:01:39.000
 real dish they are a tool but she 

00:01:35.410 --> 00:01:41.110
 bears his name okay now I'll explain 

00:01:39.000 --> 00:01:47.280
 today I suggest you cook 

00:01:41.110 --> 00:01:47.280
 tomatoes accordion good idea true 

00:01:55.479 --> 00:02:01.360
 it was a pipe 

00:02:02.470 --> 00:02:13.250
 I am also a great novel to 

00:02:10.550 --> 00:02:15.920
 cook 4 servings of tomatoes accordion 

00:02:13.250 --> 00:02:19.970
 we need 4 ripe tomatoes 

00:02:15.920 --> 00:02:22.760
 2 large eggs lemon 4 green olives 

00:02:19.970 --> 00:02:24.980
 4 black 2 tablespoons of sunflower 

00:02:22.760 --> 00:02:28.100
 butter two tablespoons of olive 

00:02:24.980 --> 00:02:28.700
 oils coarse sea salt fine salt and 

00:02:28.100 --> 00:02:32.510
 pepper 

00:02:28.700 --> 00:02:33.680
 if you want started from hard boiled I know 

00:02:32.510 --> 00:02:39.170
 how to cook 

00:02:33.680 --> 00:02:42.019
 take water to a boil for 10 yes you can and 

00:02:39.170 --> 00:02:44.690
 so probably noticed that the protein is often 

00:02:42.019 --> 00:02:46.730
 turns out to be digested and what the shell is 

00:02:44.690 --> 00:02:50.299
 cracks when eggs hit each other 

00:02:46.730 --> 00:02:52.340
 friend yes and true so i have 

00:02:50.299 --> 00:02:57.109
 a secret that will help the protein not to become 

00:02:52.340 --> 00:02:59.150
 too hard opened penny burst i 

00:02:57.109 --> 00:03:01.720
 I put the eggs in the pot and pour cold 

00:02:59.150 --> 00:03:01.720
 by water 

00:03:07.900 --> 00:03:12.640
 and it's very important to add a teaspoon 

00:03:11.500 --> 00:03:17.340
 coarse salt 

00:03:12.640 --> 00:03:17.340
 because coarse salt strengthens the cube 

00:03:18.780 --> 00:03:24.220
 put on medium heat after 

00:03:22.420 --> 00:03:27.700
 water boiled eggs 

00:03:24.220 --> 00:03:28.569
 must cook another 7 minutes that we will 

00:03:27.700 --> 00:03:30.760
 do while 

00:03:28.569 --> 00:03:33.400

00:03:30.760 --> 00:03:36.220
 4 black and 4 green olives seeds 

00:03:33.400 --> 00:03:47.470
 and cut them into small pieces of bob 

00:03:36.220 --> 00:03:50.650
 can you squeeze the juice out of lemons 

00:03:47.470 --> 00:03:53.260
 I will now prepare lemon juice 

00:03:50.650 --> 00:03:53.920
 it's like ordinary sauce and vinegar and oil and 

00:03:53.260 --> 00:03:56.500
 salt and but 

00:03:53.920 --> 00:03:59.319
 from lemon you need to pour lemon juice into 

00:03:56.500 --> 00:04:01.299
 salad bowl add six pinches of salt 

00:03:59.319 --> 00:04:02.889
 mix well with a whisk 

00:04:01.299 --> 00:04:04.870
 and then put two tablespoons 

00:04:02.889 --> 00:04:09.209
 sunflower oil and 2 tablespoons 

00:04:04.870 --> 00:04:09.209
