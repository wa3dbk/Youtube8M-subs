to recap what happened here in Colorado
with<00:00:14.910> the<00:00:15.030> floodwaters<00:00:15.630> I<00:00:16.070> guess<00:00:17.070> it<00:00:17.220> was

00:00:17.330 --> 00:00:17.340 
with the floodwaters I guess it was

00:00:17.340 --> 00:00:19.519 
with the floodwaters I guess it was
supposed<00:00:17.670> to<00:00:17.820> be<00:00:17.940> a<00:00:17.970> lot<00:00:18.449> worse<00:00:18.690> they<00:00:19.289> had

00:00:19.519 --> 00:00:19.529 
supposed to be a lot worse they had

00:00:19.529 --> 00:00:21.830 
supposed to be a lot worse they had
predicted<00:00:19.949> a<00:00:20.189> 30-foot<00:00:20.910> wall<00:00:21.210> of<00:00:21.420> water<00:00:21.660> coming

00:00:21.830 --> 00:00:21.840 
predicted a 30-foot wall of water coming

00:00:21.840 --> 00:00:25.220 
predicted a 30-foot wall of water coming
down<00:00:22.670> the<00:00:23.670> boulder<00:00:24.060> canyon<00:00:24.359> which<00:00:24.660> flattened

00:00:25.220 --> 00:00:25.230 
down the boulder canyon which flattened

00:00:25.230 --> 00:00:27.500 
down the boulder canyon which flattened
out<00:00:25.320> at<00:00:25.500> the<00:00:25.619> bottom<00:00:25.949> instead<00:00:26.490> of<00:00:26.640> rushed

00:00:27.500 --> 00:00:27.510 
out at the bottom instead of rushed

00:00:27.510 --> 00:00:29.919 
out at the bottom instead of rushed
through<00:00:27.960> so<00:00:28.650> it<00:00:29.130> could<00:00:29.369> have<00:00:29.490> been<00:00:29.580> worse

00:00:29.919 --> 00:00:29.929 
through so it could have been worse

00:00:29.929 --> 00:00:32.510 
through so it could have been worse
nonetheless<00:00:30.929> three<00:00:31.500> people<00:00:31.830> are<00:00:31.949> still<00:00:32.250> dead

00:02:24.880 --> 00:02:24.890 
ones up in Alaska and they took one away

00:02:24.890 --> 00:02:27.399 
ones up in Alaska and they took one away
here<00:02:25.280> there<00:02:25.489> was<00:02:25.700> one<00:02:25.970> right<00:02:26.480> there<00:02:26.750> they<00:02:27.200> must

00:02:27.399 --> 00:02:27.409

have just gone past 24 hours there was a
5.1<00:02:30.500> I<00:02:30.799> believe<00:02:31.510> in<00:02:32.709> the<00:02:33.709> area<00:02:34.010> that<00:02:34.069> they<00:02:34.280> had

00:02:34.449 --> 00:02:34.459 
5.1 I believe in the area that they had

00:02:34.459 --> 00:02:36.789 
5.1 I believe in the area that they had
that<00:02:34.640> seven<00:02:34.970> pointer<00:02:35.329> so<00:02:36.230> still<00:02:36.560> having

00:02:36.789 --> 00:02:36.799 
that seven pointer so still having

00:02:36.799 --> 00:02:40.630 
that seven pointer so still having
activity<00:02:37.099> around<00:02:37.489> here<00:02:37.640> and<00:02:38.090> in<00:02:38.239> Japan<00:02:39.640> last

00:02:40.630 --> 00:02:40.640 
activity around here and in Japan last

00:02:40.640 --> 00:02:43.270 
activity around here and in Japan last
but<00:02:40.909> not<00:02:40.939> least<00:02:41.150> we<00:02:41.659> have<00:02:41.689> just<00:02:42.620> information

00:02:43.270 --> 00:02:43.280 
but not least we have just information

00:02:43.280 --> 00:02:47.770 
but not least we have just information
on<00:02:43.370> comet<00:02:43.790> Ison<00:02:44.269> as<00:02:44.569> the<00:02:46.299> satellites<00:02:47.299> cameras

00:02:47.770 --> 00:02:47.780 
on comet Ison as the satellites cameras

00:02:47.780 --> 00:02:50.649 
on comet Ison as the satellites cameras
were<00:02:47.900> using<00:02:48.260> are<00:02:48.440> not<00:02:48.709> working<00:02:49.459> properly<00:02:49.790> so
