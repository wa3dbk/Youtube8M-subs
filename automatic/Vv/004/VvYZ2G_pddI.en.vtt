00:00:48.450 --> 00:00:48.460 
about her she's odd so I just did a

00:00:48.460 --> 00:00:50.459 
about her she's odd so I just did a
little<00:00:48.670> live<00:00:48.909> stream<00:00:49.389> on<00:00:49.600> periscope<00:00:50.019> you<00:00:50.289> can

00:00:50.459 --> 00:00:50.469 
little live stream on periscope you can

00:00:50.469 --> 00:00:52.289 
little live stream on periscope you can
go<00:00:50.589> see<00:00:50.859> it<00:00:50.979> I<00:00:51.069> think<00:00:51.309> it's<00:00:51.429> on<00:00:51.549> periscope<00:00:51.940> you
