short story it ranged from you know a

00:00:14.700 --> 00:00:18.200 
short story it ranged from you know a
thousand<00:00:15.330> words<00:00:15.540> to<00:00:16.460> 1,200<00:00:17.460> -<00:00:17.760> some<00:00:18.000> people

00:00:18.200 --> 00:00:18.210 
thousand words to 1,200 - some people

00:00:18.210 --> 00:00:19.970 
thousand words to 1,200 - some people

have been saying 1500 words for a

00:00:19.980 --> 00:00:21.980 
have been saying 1500 words for a
creative<00:00:20.369> writing<00:00:20.580> piece<00:00:20.850> the<00:00:21.359> average<00:00:21.720> of

00:00:21.980 --> 00:00:21.990 
creative writing piece the average of

00:00:21.990 --> 00:00:23.630 
creative writing piece the average of
about<00:00:22.320> a<00:00:22.470> thousand<00:00:22.949> words<00:00:23.100> we<00:00:23.279> think<00:00:23.310> that's

00:00:23.630 --> 00:00:23.640 
about a thousand words we think that's

00:00:23.640 --> 00:00:25.550 
about a thousand words we think that's
probably<00:00:24.090> a<00:00:24.240> bit<00:00:24.510> higher<00:00:24.750> than<00:00:25.080> what<00:00:25.260> it<00:00:25.380> needs

00:00:25.550 --> 00:00:25.560 
probably a bit higher than what it needs

00:00:25.560 --> 00:00:28.060 
probably a bit higher than what it needs
to<00:00:25.650> be<00:00:25.859> we<00:00:26.519> tend<00:00:26.789> to<00:00:26.849> say<00:00:27.029> somewhere<00:00:27.480> between

00:00:28.060 --> 00:00:28.070 
to be we tend to say somewhere between

00:00:28.070 --> 00:00:31.460 
to be we tend to say somewhere between
750<00:00:29.070> and<00:00:29.369> 850<00:00:29.670> words<00:00:30.029> so<00:00:30.210> approximately<00:00:30.660> 800

00:00:31.460 --> 00:00:31.470 
750 and 850 words so approximately 800

00:00:31.470 --> 00:00:33.740 
750 and 850 words so approximately 800
words<00:00:31.679> give<00:00:31.920> or<00:00:32.070> take<00:00:32.250> I<00:00:32.520> know<00:00:33.360> that<00:00:33.480> might

00:00:33.740 --> 00:00:33.750 
words give or take I know that might

00:00:33.750 --> 00:00:36.229 
words give or take I know that might
seem<00:00:33.960> really<00:00:34.020> short<00:00:34.649> to<00:00:35.010> a<00:00:35.040> lot<00:00:35.250> of<00:00:35.280> you<00:00:35.520> but<00:00:35.790> we

00:00:36.229 --> 00:00:36.239 
seem really short to a lot of you but we

00:00:36.239 --> 00:00:37.400 
seem really short to a lot of you but we
don't<00:00:36.329> think<00:00:36.540> you<00:00:36.690> really<00:00:36.989> need<00:00:37.110> to<00:00:37.230> push

00:00:37.400 --> 00:00:37.410 
don't think you really need to push

00:00:37.410 --> 00:00:40.160 
don't think you really need to push
yourself<00:00:37.770> beyond<00:00:38.489> 800<00:00:39.149> words<00:00:39.390> to<00:00:39.750> really<00:00:40.020> get

00:00:40.160 --> 00:00:40.170 
yourself beyond 800 words to really get

00:00:40.170 --> 00:00:41.450 
yourself beyond 800 words to really get
into<00:00:40.320> the<00:00:40.469> a<00:00:40.500> range<00:00:40.860> for<00:00:41.100> your<00:00:41.190> story

00:00:41.450 --> 00:00:41.460 
into the a range for your story

00:00:41.460 --> 00:00:43.400 
into the a range for your story
obviously<00:00:41.940> it<00:00:42.059> saves<00:00:42.300> you<00:00:42.450> time<00:00:42.690> for<00:00:43.320> your

00:00:43.400 --> 00:00:43.410 
obviously it saves you time for your

00:00:43.410 --> 00:00:45.200 
obviously it saves you time for your
essay<00:00:43.680> and<00:00:44.010> section<00:00:44.399> 1<00:00:44.550> so<00:00:44.760> I<00:00:44.789> think<00:00:45.030> it's<00:00:45.149> a

00:00:45.200 --> 00:00:45.210 
essay and section 1 so I think it's a

00:00:45.210 --> 00:00:47.090 
essay and section 1 so I think it's a
good<00:00:45.329> approach<00:00:45.450> so<00:00:46.379> this<00:00:46.559> video<00:00:46.800> I'm<00:00:46.920> gonna

00:00:47.090 --> 00:00:47.100 
good approach so this video I'm gonna

00:00:47.100 --> 00:00:48.560 
good approach so this video I'm gonna
I'm<00:00:47.370> going<00:00:47.520> to<00:00:47.610> give<00:00:47.700> you<00:00:47.820> some<00:00:48.000> pros<00:00:48.270> and<00:00:48.300> cons

00:00:48.560 --> 00:00:48.570 
I'm going to give you some pros and cons

00:00:48.570 --> 00:00:50.720 
I'm going to give you some pros and cons
to<00:00:48.930> writing<00:00:49.620> such<00:00:49.800> a<00:00:49.829> short<00:00:50.190> story

00:00:50.720 --> 00:00:50.730 
to writing such a short story

00:00:50.730 --> 00:00:53.090 
to writing such a short story
so<00:00:51.120> obviously<00:00:51.719> belonging<00:00:52.110> there's<00:00:52.800> three

00:00:53.090 --> 00:00:53.100 
so obviously belonging there's three

00:00:53.100 --> 00:00:55.010 
so obviously belonging there's three
sections<00:00:53.640> and<00:00:53.879> you<00:00:53.969> allocate<00:00:54.300> 40<00:00:54.629> minutes<00:00:54.899> for

00:00:55.010 --> 00:00:55.020 
sections and you allocate 40 minutes for

00:00:55.020 --> 00:00:57.020 
sections and you allocate 40 minutes for
each<00:00:55.050> section<00:00:55.379> so<00:00:55.770> if<00:00:56.039> you're<00:00:56.610> come<00:00:56.760> in<00:00:56.879> with<00:00:57.000> a

00:00:57.020 --> 00:00:57.030 
each section so if you're come in with a

00:00:57.030 --> 00:00:58.970 
each section so if you're come in with a
pre-prepared<00:00:57.600> story<00:00:57.930> that<00:00:58.260> takes<00:00:58.440> you<00:00:58.649> 40

00:00:58.970 --> 00:00:58.980 
pre-prepared story that takes you 40

00:00:58.980 --> 00:01:00.410 
pre-prepared story that takes you 40
minutes<00:00:59.280> and<00:00:59.399> you<00:00:59.489> only<00:00:59.670> have<00:00:59.910> 40<00:01:00.270> minutes

00:01:00.410 --> 00:01:00.420 
minutes and you only have 40 minutes

00:01:00.420 --> 00:01:02.599 
minutes and you only have 40 minutes
it's<00:01:00.989> really<00:01:01.350> not<00:01:01.530> leaving<00:01:01.949> much<00:01:02.070> room<00:01:02.399> there

00:01:02.599 --> 00:01:02.609 
it's really not leaving much room there

00:01:02.609 --> 00:01:04.250 
it's really not leaving much room there
for<00:01:02.820> error<00:01:03.000> so<00:01:03.270> if<00:01:03.329> you<00:01:03.420> get<00:01:03.570> a<00:01:03.600> stimulus<00:01:04.080> that

00:01:04.250 --> 00:01:04.260 
for error so if you get a stimulus that

00:01:04.260 --> 00:01:05.870 
for error so if you get a stimulus that
tricks<00:01:04.559> you<00:01:04.710> or<00:01:05.100> the<00:01:05.189> essay<00:01:05.460> question<00:01:05.820> is

00:01:05.870 --> 00:01:05.880 
tricks you or the essay question is

00:01:07.730 --> 00:01:07.740 
really hard it's here been really hard

00:01:07.740 --> 00:01:09.649 
really hard it's here been really hard
for<00:01:07.920> you<00:01:08.010> to<00:01:08.040> adapt<00:01:08.520> and<00:01:08.729> still<00:01:09.090> write<00:01:09.630> a

response within the time limit whereas
800<00:01:12.450> words<00:01:12.630> is<00:01:12.810> going<00:01:12.990> to<00:01:13.049> take<00:01:13.200> you<00:01:13.500> somewhere

00:01:13.760 --> 00:01:13.770 
800 words is going to take you somewhere

00:01:13.770 --> 00:01:16.580 
800 words is going to take you somewhere
between<00:01:14.040> 25<00:01:14.700> and<00:01:14.729> 30<00:01:15.119> minutes<00:01:15.360> depending<00:01:16.259> on

00:01:16.580 --> 00:01:16.590 
between 25 and 30 minutes depending on

00:01:16.590 --> 00:01:18.200 
between 25 and 30 minutes depending on
how<00:01:16.770> fast<00:01:16.979> you<00:01:17.189> write<00:01:17.400> I<00:01:17.549> mean<00:01:17.580> I<00:01:17.729> know<00:01:17.909> my

00:01:18.200 --> 00:01:18.210 
how fast you write I mean I know my

00:01:18.210 --> 00:01:20.390 
how fast you write I mean I know my
story<00:01:18.509> was<00:01:18.750> about<00:01:18.840> 750<00:01:19.770> words<00:01:20.100> my

00:01:20.390 --> 00:01:20.400 
story was about 750 words my

00:01:20.400 --> 00:01:22.520 
story was about 750 words my
pre-prepared<00:01:20.970> story<00:01:21.270> and<00:01:21.509> I<00:01:22.049> could<00:01:22.229> get<00:01:22.350> that

00:01:22.520 --> 00:01:22.530 
pre-prepared story and I could get that

00:01:22.530 --> 00:01:25.490 
pre-prepared story and I could get that
down<00:01:22.710> in<00:01:22.860> about<00:01:23.040> 22<00:01:23.520> minutes<00:01:23.700> so<00:01:24.689> it<00:01:25.140> really

00:01:25.490 --> 00:01:25.500 
down in about 22 minutes so it really

00:01:25.500 --> 00:01:27.620 
down in about 22 minutes so it really
what<00:01:25.799> it<00:01:25.890> does<00:01:26.070> is<00:01:26.250> it<00:01:26.369> saves<00:01:26.549> you<00:01:26.909> 10<00:01:27.119> to<00:01:27.270> 15

00:01:27.620 --> 00:01:27.630 
what it does is it saves you 10 to 15

00:03:02.119 --> 00:03:02.129 
to be that's going to be the key to

00:03:02.129 --> 00:03:03.860 
to be that's going to be the key to
differentiate<00:03:02.910> those<00:03:03.090> that<00:03:03.390> are<00:03:03.480> coming<00:03:03.780> in

with a pre-prepared story and those that

00:03:05.310 --> 00:03:06.920 
with a pre-prepared story and those that
can<00:03:05.459> actually<00:03:05.579> adapt<00:03:06.060> on<00:03:06.209> the<00:03:06.299> day<00:03:06.480> if<00:03:06.750> you're

00:03:06.920 --> 00:03:06.930 
can actually adapt on the day if you're

00:03:06.930 --> 00:03:09.680 
can actually adapt on the day if you're
writing<00:03:07.610> 1,100<00:03:08.610> words<00:03:08.849> that's<00:03:09.299> going<00:03:09.510> to<00:03:09.569> take

00:03:09.680 --> 00:03:09.690 
writing 1,100 words that's going to take

00:03:09.690 --> 00:03:11.059 
writing 1,100 words that's going to take
you<00:03:09.840> 40<00:03:10.140> minutes<00:03:10.379> you're<00:03:10.530> not<00:03:10.650> really<00:03:10.950> going

00:03:11.059 --> 00:03:11.069 
you 40 minutes you're not really going

00:03:11.069 --> 00:03:12.710 
you 40 minutes you're not really going
to<00:03:11.129> incorporate<00:03:11.370> the<00:03:11.730> stimulus<00:03:12.209> well<00:03:12.420> enough

00:03:12.710 --> 00:03:12.720 
to incorporate the stimulus well enough

00:03:12.720 --> 00:03:16.729 
to incorporate the stimulus well enough
to<00:03:13.500> get<00:03:13.680> you<00:03:14.069> know<00:03:14.160> 13<00:03:14.610> 14<00:03:15.000> 15<00:03:15.180> out<00:03:15.569> of<00:03:15.599> 15<00:03:15.840> if

00:03:16.729 --> 00:03:16.739 
to get you know 13 14 15 out of 15 if

00:03:16.739 --> 00:03:19.160 
to get you know 13 14 15 out of 15 if
you<00:03:16.860> go<00:03:16.980> in<00:03:17.129> there<00:03:17.250> with<00:03:17.430> 750<00:03:17.970> 800<00:03:18.420> words<00:03:18.630> you

00:03:19.160 --> 00:03:19.170 
you go in there with 750 800 words you

00:03:19.170 --> 00:03:20.690 
you go in there with 750 800 words you
can<00:03:19.319> sort<00:03:19.530> of<00:03:19.620> breathe<00:03:19.829> take<00:03:20.220> it<00:03:20.370> in<00:03:20.489> and

00:03:20.690 --> 00:03:20.700 
can sort of breathe take it in and

00:03:20.700 --> 00:03:22.550 
can sort of breathe take it in and
really<00:03:21.239> focus<00:03:21.780> on<00:03:21.900> incorporating<00:03:22.139> the

00:03:22.550 --> 00:03:22.560 
really focus on incorporating the

00:03:22.560 --> 00:03:23.990 
really focus on incorporating the
stimulus<00:03:22.980> which<00:03:23.160> is<00:03:23.280> where<00:03:23.489> most<00:03:23.670> of<00:03:23.850> your

00:03:23.990 --> 00:03:24.000 
stimulus which is where most of your

00:03:24.000 --> 00:03:25.699 
stimulus which is where most of your
marks<00:03:24.239> are<00:03:24.329> going<00:03:24.450> to<00:03:24.510> come<00:03:24.660> from<00:03:24.810> so<00:03:25.049> really

00:03:25.699 --> 00:03:25.709 
marks are going to come from so really

00:03:25.709 --> 00:03:27.650 
marks are going to come from so really
for<00:03:25.859> mine<00:03:26.040> a<00:03:26.310> shorter<00:03:26.940> story<00:03:27.180> is<00:03:27.450> going<00:03:27.600> to

00:03:27.650 --> 00:03:27.660 
for mine a shorter story is going to

00:03:27.660 --> 00:03:29.270 
for mine a shorter story is going to
allow<00:03:27.870> you<00:03:27.930> to<00:03:28.079> get<00:03:28.350> better<00:03:28.590> marks<00:03:28.889> in<00:03:29.160> the

00:03:29.270 --> 00:03:29.280 
allow you to get better marks in the

00:03:29.280 --> 00:03:31.099 
allow you to get better marks in the
exam<00:03:29.310> so<00:03:29.849> to<00:03:29.910> sum<00:03:30.150> up<00:03:30.180> it's<00:03:30.420> all<00:03:30.569> about<00:03:30.780> giving

00:03:31.099 --> 00:03:31.109 
exam so to sum up it's all about giving

00:03:31.109 --> 00:03:33.500 
exam so to sum up it's all about giving
yourself<00:03:31.349> a<00:03:31.709> buffer<00:03:31.889> you<00:03:32.250> don't<00:03:33.090> really<00:03:33.329> want

00:03:33.500 --> 00:03:33.510 
yourself a buffer you don't really want

00:03:33.510 --> 00:03:34.879 
yourself a buffer you don't really want
to<00:03:33.540> write<00:03:33.750> to<00:03:34.019> the<00:03:34.109> limits<00:03:34.470> because<00:03:34.650> if

00:03:34.879 --> 00:03:34.889 
to write to the limits because if

00:03:34.889 --> 00:03:36.349 
to write to the limits because if
something<00:03:35.190> unexpected<00:03:35.760> happens<00:03:36.120> you<00:03:36.239> don't

00:03:36.349 --> 00:03:36.359 
something unexpected happens you don't

00:03:36.359 --> 00:03:37.849 
something unexpected happens you don't
want<00:03:36.540> to<00:03:36.599> be<00:03:36.660> dropping<00:03:36.870> marks<00:03:37.380> just<00:03:37.620> because

00:03:37.849 --> 00:03:37.859 
want to be dropping marks just because

00:03:37.859 --> 00:03:38.750 
want to be dropping marks just because
you're<00:03:37.980> going<00:03:38.069> to<00:03:38.160> be<00:03:38.250> running<00:03:38.430> out<00:03:38.609> of<00:03:38.639> time
