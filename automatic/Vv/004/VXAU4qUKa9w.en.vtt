 which leaves as saying that ball through 9 

00:02:22.209 --> 00:02:25.870
 detailing is good enough 

00:02:24.220 --> 00:02:27.190
 but this was hard work from Matthew 

00:02:25.870 --> 00:02:30.010
 frets 

00:02:27.190 --> 00:02:31.239

00:02:30.010 --> 00:02:34.630
 keeper 

00:02:31.239 --> 00:02:36.280

00:02:34.630 --> 00:02:39.040
 second goal for him the third 

00:02:36.280 --> 00:02:40.390

00:02:43.180 --> 00:02:50.079
 vitesse and he was responsible for 

00:02:45.220 --> 00:02:50.859
 the majority of goals 2 so how psv 

00:02:50.079 --> 00:02:53.380
 under 17 

00:02:50.859 --> 00:02:56.170

00:02:56.170 --> 00:03:00.579
 fewer but 2 matches less and 

00:02:58.510 --> 00:03:03.540
