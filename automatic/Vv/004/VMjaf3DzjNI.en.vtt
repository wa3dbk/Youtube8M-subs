00:00:17.690 --> 00:00:21.710
 very good to all and all how about 

00:00:19.820 --> 00:00:24.740
 you are on this occasion it was my turn 

00:00:21.710 --> 00:00:27.380
 retro challenge so the game is final 

00:00:24.740 --> 00:00:30.230
 star force being the third part of the 

00:00:27.380 --> 00:00:35.210
 saga star fox published is developed 

00:00:30.230 --> 00:00:37.760
 by tecmo in the year 1992 is very very 

00:00:35.210 --> 00:00:40.640
 easy you have to overcome the first level 

00:00:37.760 --> 00:00:43.100
 without using grenades without dying that since 

00:00:40.640 --> 00:00:45.530
 it was not maximum possible score I would 

00:00:43.100 --> 00:00:48.830
 I'm flying with time to sit down 

00:00:45.530 --> 00:00:51.140
 the employees and well we are going to give him cane 

00:00:48.830 --> 00:00:52.960
 because it's a game that at the beginning 

00:00:51.140 --> 00:00:55.030
 Other vision does not make it easier for you 

00:00:52.960 --> 00:00:56.800
 I continue it a bit since it exceeds 

00:00:55.030 --> 00:01:00.930
 also the maximum score that brings the 

00:00:56.800 --> 00:01:00.930
 default game come on let's go for it 

00:01:02.850 --> 00:01:06.630
 he understood he had inserted the coin like this 

00:01:05.280 --> 00:01:09.090
 what 

00:01:06.630 --> 00:01:11.070
 let's give the first meeting the 

00:01:09.090 --> 00:01:13.740
 first phase is quite easy you have to 

00:01:11.070 --> 00:01:15.869
 see what the challenge is very simple here 

00:01:13.740 --> 00:01:17.880
 we started here directly appears a 

00:01:15.869 --> 00:01:19.289
 enemy that shoots us but I what 

00:01:17.880 --> 00:01:21.119
 I do is acquire enough points because 

00:01:19.289 --> 00:01:24.149
 been disparate acting much faster 

00:01:21.119 --> 00:01:26.250
 you can place it there leave it eight 

00:01:24.149 --> 00:01:28.200
 shit and here come three ships that 

00:01:26.250 --> 00:01:32.159
 standing still and firing not what 

00:01:28.200 --> 00:01:34.079
 we would accept and if that red ship that I 

00:01:32.159 --> 00:01:36.810
 at the beginning of difficult of that hand 

00:01:34.079 --> 00:01:38.819
 for the power apps I always try 

00:01:36.810 --> 00:01:41.909
 catch this blue or one of a ray that 

00:01:38.819 --> 00:01:44.189
 for me are the best this ship is me 

00:01:41.909 --> 00:01:46.259
 escape from start go go though not 

00:01:44.189 --> 00:01:48.840
 they surpass the score but let's go here is 

00:01:46.259 --> 00:01:50.580
 super simple is to wait to memorize and a 

00:01:48.840 --> 00:01:52.860
 little patience the power up and 

00:01:50.580 --> 00:01:54.450
 going up only depending on how you 

00:01:52.860 --> 00:01:56.280
 you are using when the bar is filled 

00:01:54.450 --> 00:01:57.990
 from below or also when the workers 

00:01:56.280 --> 00:02:00.360
 we know 

00:01:57.990 --> 00:02:02.070
 As you can see it is very simple here and it takes 

00:02:00.360 --> 00:02:03.720
 a lot in shooting the enemies of this 

00:02:02.070 --> 00:02:06.060
 half a power 

00:02:03.720 --> 00:02:08.160
 this power I do not take it because the shot 

00:02:06.060 --> 00:02:10.700
 it's very bad and friends do not really 

00:02:08.160 --> 00:02:12.840
 it's good for nothing 

00:02:10.700 --> 00:02:14.819
 we want everyone to really phase and 

00:02:12.840 --> 00:02:16.770
 we have to be a little we do it very 

00:02:14.819 --> 00:02:18.060
 quick here we shoot this from the 

00:02:16.770 --> 00:02:19.860
 right then let us shoot the 

00:02:18.060 --> 00:02:21.420
 whole parties that if one is still alive no 

00:02:19.860 --> 00:02:24.270
 I know if we go there at the right time 

00:02:21.420 --> 00:02:25.970
 optimism we keep firing forward 

00:02:24.270 --> 00:02:27.989
 here come four we follow 

00:02:25.970 --> 00:02:30.620
 adapting from all sides already as 

00:02:27.989 --> 00:02:34.590
 they will see uploads of the web team to level 4 

00:02:30.620 --> 00:02:37.060
 and now nothing nothing nothing and in the boss is 

00:02:34.590 --> 00:02:39.190
 very very simple 

00:02:37.060 --> 00:02:41.230
 to the music in chief of the cycle I love 

00:02:39.190 --> 00:02:44.290
 start shooting him from there because 

00:02:41.230 --> 00:02:45.760
 the two trucks they begin to 

00:02:44.290 --> 00:02:48.040
 throw us with the blues and the easiest 

00:02:45.760 --> 00:02:50.319
 is to destroy them from the pull and dodge 

00:02:48.040 --> 00:02:51.819
 to the left of here they throw as they gave 

00:02:50.319 --> 00:02:53.620
 a couple of warning shots for 

00:02:51.819 --> 00:02:56.260
 As you can see, he has not given me any time 

00:02:53.620 --> 00:02:58.840
 explain the ones so I find it incredible 

00:02:56.260 --> 00:03:01.300
 good friends and friends I would like that 

00:02:58.840 --> 00:03:04.480

00:03:01.300 --> 00:03:05.830
 challenge is ready is very simple 

00:03:04.480 --> 00:03:07.630

 you think because it 's a great game I can 

00:03:07.630 --> 00:03:11.560
 secure and good to see if I encourage 

00:03:09.790 --> 00:03:13.510
 finish them to a credit that I think 

00:03:11.560 --> 00:03:15.790
 this game can be because I'm already 

00:03:13.510 --> 00:03:17.230
 going crazy with the iron fighters and 

00:03:15.790 --> 00:03:19.660
 I have not had any games for a long time 

00:03:17.230 --> 00:03:21.010
 of planes over here good greetings to 

00:03:19.660 --> 00:03:23.580
 all and all and I say goodbye until the
