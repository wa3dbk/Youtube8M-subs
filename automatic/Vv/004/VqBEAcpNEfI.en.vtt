00:00:04.220 --> 00:00:04.230 
taking a look at the incipio fraction

00:00:04.230 --> 00:00:08.059 
taking a look at the incipio fraction
for<00:00:04.770> the<00:00:04.799> iPhone<00:00:05.220> 5<00:00:05.899> as<00:00:06.899> with<00:00:07.140> pretty<00:00:07.740> much<00:00:07.859> all

stand so you can watch things

00:00:16.440 --> 00:00:18.320 
stand so you can watch things
horizontally<00:00:16.830> stuff<00:00:17.460> that<00:00:17.670> pops<00:00:17.880> up<00:00:18.090> quite

00:00:18.320 --> 00:00:18.330 
horizontally stuff that pops up quite

00:00:18.330 --> 00:00:21.400

easily<00:00:18.510> and<00:00:19.289> now<00:00:19.949> this<00:00:20.100> is<00:00:20.310> the<00:00:20.400> case<00:00:20.609> itself

00:00:21.400 --> 00:00:21.410 
easily and now this is the case itself

00:00:21.410 --> 00:00:24.080 
easily and now this is the case itself
almost<00:00:22.410> looks<00:00:22.800> like<00:00:22.890> a<00:00:23.010> two-piece<00:00:23.550> case<00:00:23.880> which

00:00:24.080 --> 00:00:24.090 
almost looks like a two-piece case which

00:00:24.090 --> 00:00:25.460 
almost looks like a two-piece case which
is<00:00:24.269> quite<00:00:24.539> interesting<00:00:24.689> but<00:00:25.199> you<00:00:25.260> haven't

does it does got that kind of touches

00:01:42.840 --> 00:01:44.660 
does it does got that kind of touches
starting<00:01:43.259> with<00:01:43.409> the<00:01:43.530> two-piece<00:01:44.070> case<00:01:44.369> look

00:01:44.660 --> 00:01:44.670 
starting with the two-piece case look

00:01:44.670 --> 00:01:47.420 
starting with the two-piece case look
that<00:01:45.240> does<00:01:45.450> just<00:01:46.140> set<00:01:46.350> the<00:01:46.439> phone<00:01:46.649> off<00:01:46.890> on<00:01:47.070> a<00:01:47.100> on

that does just set the phone off on a on

00:01:47.430 --> 00:01:49.069 
that does just set the phone off on a on
a<00:01:47.460> white<00:01:47.700> phone<00:01:47.939> especially<00:01:48.180> in<00:01:48.600> this<00:01:48.720> color<00:01:48.990> I

00:01:49.069 --> 00:01:49.079 
a white phone especially in this color I

00:01:49.079 --> 00:01:51.440 
a white phone especially in this color I
believe<00:01:49.320> it<00:01:49.439> is<00:01:49.560> available<00:01:50.070> in<00:01:50.909> a<00:01:51.000> black<00:01:51.240> color

00:01:51.440 --> 00:01:51.450 
believe it is available in a black color

00:01:51.450 --> 00:01:53.149 
believe it is available in a black color
a<00:01:51.600> common<00:01:51.990> what<00:01:52.140> they<00:01:52.290> round<00:01:52.590> the<00:01:52.649> front<00:01:52.829> is

00:01:53.149 --> 00:01:53.159 
a common what they round the front is

00:01:53.159 --> 00:01:55.190 
a common what they round the front is
but<00:01:53.430> that<00:01:53.909> should<00:01:54.149> definitely<00:01:54.450> be<00:01:54.750> more<00:01:54.899> suit

00:01:55.190 --> 00:01:55.200 
but that should definitely be more suit

00:01:55.200 --> 00:01:57.530 
but that should definitely be more suit
to<00:01:55.380> a<00:01:55.409> black<00:01:55.649> phone<00:01:55.979> it<00:01:56.939> doesn't<00:01:57.149> have<00:01:57.299> too

00:01:57.530 --> 00:01:57.540 
to a black phone it doesn't have too

00:01:57.540 --> 00:01:58.940 
to a black phone it doesn't have too
much<00:01:57.689> white<00:01:57.990> and<00:01:58.259> it<00:01:58.350> does<00:01:58.500> off<00:01:58.649> a<00:01:58.680> decent

00:01:58.940 --> 00:01:58.950 
much white and it does off a decent

00:01:58.950 --> 00:02:01.609 
much white and it does off a decent
impact<00:01:59.460> protection<00:01:59.610> so<00:02:00.570> all<00:02:01.170> in<00:02:01.380> all<00:02:01.469> if
