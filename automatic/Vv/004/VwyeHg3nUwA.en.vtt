to 10 miles per hour

00:01:09.900 --> 00:01:11.600

00:01:11.600 --> 00:01:11.610 
and really if you're gonna do a hike it

00:01:11.610 --> 00:01:13.520 
and really if you're gonna do a hike it
is<00:01:11.729> probably<00:01:12.119> best<00:01:12.420> to<00:01:12.570> do<00:01:12.750> it<00:01:12.780> early<00:01:13.260> just

00:01:13.520 --> 00:01:13.530 
is probably best to do it early just

00:01:13.530 --> 00:01:15.050 
is probably best to do it early just
because<00:01:13.770> we'll<00:01:13.950> be<00:01:13.979> warming<00:01:14.460> up<00:01:14.549> quite<00:01:14.790> a<00:01:14.820> bit

00:01:15.050 --> 00:01:15.060 
because we'll be warming up quite a bit

00:01:15.060 --> 00:01:17.240 
because we'll be warming up quite a bit
tomorrow<00:01:15.450> by<00:01:15.960> noon<00:01:15.990> we'll<00:01:16.530> be<00:01:16.560> sitting<00:01:17.009> in<00:01:17.100> the

00:01:17.240 --> 00:01:17.250 
tomorrow by noon we'll be sitting in the

00:01:17.250 --> 00:01:18.890 
tomorrow by noon we'll be sitting in the
low<00:01:17.430> 80s<00:01:17.880> and<00:01:18.060> then<00:01:18.390> tomorrow<00:01:18.720> we're

00:01:18.890 --> 00:01:18.900 
low 80s and then tomorrow we're

00:01:18.900 --> 00:01:21.530 
low 80s and then tomorrow we're
expecting<00:01:19.380> a<00:01:19.439> high<00:01:19.619> of<00:01:19.650> 89<00:01:20.369> degrees<00:01:20.820> so<00:01:21.240> again

00:01:21.530 --> 00:01:21.540 
expecting a high of 89 degrees so again

00:01:21.540 --> 00:01:23.330 
expecting a high of 89 degrees so again
I<00:01:21.570> mentioned<00:01:21.990> taking<00:01:22.259> the<00:01:22.350> water<00:01:22.590> it's<00:01:23.130> not

00:01:23.330 --> 00:01:23.340 
I mentioned taking the water it's not

00:01:23.340 --> 00:01:24.830 
I mentioned taking the water it's not
like<00:01:23.520> we're<00:01:23.700> in<00:01:23.820> the<00:01:23.909> 100's<00:01:24.540> but<00:01:24.600> it's

00:01:24.830 --> 00:01:24.840 
like we're in the 100's but it's

00:01:24.840 --> 00:01:26.780 
like we're in the 100's but it's
certainly<00:01:25.140> a<00:01:25.350> lot<00:01:25.770> warmer<00:01:26.009> than<00:01:26.159> we<00:01:26.369> should<00:01:26.610> be

00:01:26.780 --> 00:01:26.790 
certainly a lot warmer than we should be

00:01:26.790 --> 00:01:28.550 
certainly a lot warmer than we should be
this<00:01:27.270> time<00:01:27.330> of<00:01:27.570> year<00:01:27.930> we<00:01:28.049> should<00:01:28.110> only<00:01:28.320> be<00:01:28.470> in

00:01:28.550 --> 00:01:28.560 
this time of year we should only be in

00:01:28.560 --> 00:01:30.289 
this time of year we should only be in
the<00:01:28.680> 70s<00:01:29.280> but<00:01:29.430> because<00:01:29.790> of<00:01:29.820> this<00:01:30.090> high

00:01:30.289 --> 00:01:30.299 
the 70s but because of this high
