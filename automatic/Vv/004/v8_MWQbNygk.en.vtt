 has mechanical engineering innovatively fast 

00:00:05.509 --> 00:00:13.710
 solution-oriented rapid prototyping 

00:00:11.360 --> 00:00:16.009
 services of the arboreal engineering 

00:00:13.710 --> 00:00:16.009
 GmbH 

00:00:17.029 --> 00:00:22.500
 what science fiction was yesterday was 

00:00:19.949 --> 00:00:24.990
 already reality today and all of us 

00:00:22.500 --> 00:00:31.170
 can benefit from it by rapid 

00:00:24.990 --> 00:00:33.750
 prototyping and 3d printing if you have one 

00:00:31.170 --> 00:00:38.610
 new product idea is in the pipeline 

00:00:33.750 --> 00:00:42.290
 the one you want out of there is one 

00:00:38.610 --> 00:00:42.290
 a lot of application possibilities 

00:00:42.379 --> 00:00:48.469
 They want the spectacle of their 

00:00:45.030 --> 00:00:51.270
 product idea to test by a small series 

00:00:48.469 --> 00:00:52.800
 you are a product designer and you want to 

00:00:51.270 --> 00:00:57.149
 her designs are not just virtual 

00:00:52.800 --> 00:00:58.800
 consider you are marketing specialist 

00:00:57.149 --> 00:01:00.629
 and want with innovative and

 Personal advertising materials shine 

00:01:00.629 --> 00:01:05.489
 They are craftsmen or machine builders 

00:01:03.180 --> 00:01:06.619
 and need fast and inexpensive one 

00:01:05.489 --> 00:01:09.180
 functional part 

00:01:06.619 --> 00:01:12.060
 everything you need in the future 

00:01:09.180 --> 00:01:16.380
 is a virtual 3d model and one 

00:01:12.060 --> 00:01:17.939
 3d printers should not care about both 

00:01:16.380 --> 00:01:20.689
 It can be the tree species 

00:01:17.939 --> 00:01:23.549
 assist maschinenbau gmbh 

00:01:20.689 --> 00:01:27.210
 the market has been starting up for quite some time 

00:01:23.549 --> 00:01:28.820
 rapid prototyping and 3d printing not only 

00:01:27.210 --> 00:01:30.960
 to your own development and 

00:01:28.820 --> 00:01:32.939
 but to optimize the production process 

00:01:30.960 --> 00:01:35.610
 also for his customers new possibilities 

00:01:32.939 --> 00:01:37.500
 to open for example in the research and 

00:01:35.610 --> 00:01:39.540
 Development work in product design 

00:01:37.500 --> 00:01:41.850
 and in the creation of prototypes 

00:01:39.540 --> 00:01:47.979
 and functional parts 

00:01:41.850 --> 00:01:52.990
 the place service in four steps from 

00:01:47.979 --> 00:01:55.150
 your idea we work out for you 

00:01:52.990 --> 00:02:03.540
 proposals for the implementation of their 

00:01:55.150 --> 00:02:03.540
 wishes and ideas about the 3d model 

00:02:03.600 --> 00:02:11.220
 We create on the basis of your sketch 

00:02:06.520 --> 00:02:17.830
 or her 2d cad file a 3d model 

00:02:11.220 --> 00:02:26.440
 to the printed object we print that 

00:02:17.830 --> 00:02:31.660
 model with our 3d prints off or 

00:02:26.440 --> 00:02:34.480
 for small series if necessary 

00:02:31.660 --> 00:02:36.310
 we find external service providers an the 

00:02:34.480 --> 00:02:40.620
 on small batches or certain 

00:02:36.310 --> 00:02:40.620
 material requirements are specialized 

00:02:41.190 --> 00:02:50.730
 from your idea about the 3d model to 

00:02:46.299 --> 00:02:55.260
 printed object or small series 

00:02:50.730 --> 00:02:55.260
 the market service in four steps 

00:02:58.350 --> 00:03:04.470
 mechanical engineering innovative fast 

00:03:01.470 --> 00:03:04.470
