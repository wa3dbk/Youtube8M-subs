00:03:05.670 --> 00:03:05.680 
that's going to go all along the top of

00:03:05.680 --> 00:03:07.800 
that's going to go all along the top of
the<00:03:05.769> world<00:03:05.980> building<00:03:06.639> as<00:03:07.150> well<00:03:07.389> as<00:03:07.449> all<00:03:07.689> the

00:03:07.800 --> 00:03:07.810 
the world building as well as all the

00:03:07.810 --> 00:03:09.330 
the world building as well as all the
windows<00:03:08.199> will<00:03:08.379> be<00:03:08.469> trimmed<00:03:08.799> in<00:03:09.099> all<00:03:09.219> the

00:03:09.330 --> 00:03:09.340 
windows will be trimmed in all the

00:03:09.340 --> 00:03:11.490 
windows will be trimmed in all the
corners<00:03:09.790> so<00:03:09.819> once<00:03:10.209> you<00:03:10.329> add<00:03:10.480> in<00:03:10.750> the<00:03:11.019> wood<00:03:11.260> it

00:03:11.490 --> 00:03:11.500 
corners so once you add in the wood it

00:03:11.500 --> 00:03:13.920 
corners so once you add in the wood it
becomes<00:03:11.799> a<00:03:12.040> much<00:03:12.219> warmer<00:03:12.549> look<00:03:13.030> than<00:03:13.540> just<00:03:13.810> the

00:03:13.920 --> 00:03:13.930 
becomes a much warmer look than just the

00:03:13.930 --> 00:03:16.619 
becomes a much warmer look than just the
middle<00:03:14.250> so<00:03:15.250> these<00:03:15.430> are<00:03:15.579> old<00:03:15.730> reclaimed<00:03:16.000> Pella

00:03:16.619 --> 00:03:16.629 
middle so these are old reclaimed Pella

00:03:16.629 --> 00:03:18.899 
middle so these are old reclaimed Pella
windows<00:03:17.109> they're<00:03:17.560> cranked<00:03:17.919> very<00:03:18.579> great

00:03:18.899 --> 00:03:18.909 
windows they're cranked very great

00:03:18.909 --> 00:03:21.539 
windows they're cranked very great
windows<00:03:19.359> and<00:03:19.930> they<00:03:20.769> almost<00:03:20.919> wound<00:03:21.250> up<00:03:21.370> in<00:03:21.489> the

00:03:21.539 --> 00:03:21.549 
windows and they almost wound up in the

00:03:21.549 --> 00:03:23.699 
windows and they almost wound up in the
trash<00:03:21.790> this<00:03:22.629> is<00:03:22.840> gonna<00:03:22.930> have<00:03:23.230> a<00:03:23.260> six-foot

00:03:23.699 --> 00:03:23.709 
trash this is gonna have a six-foot

00:03:23.709 --> 00:03:26.520 
trash this is gonna have a six-foot
overhang<00:03:24.430> and<00:03:24.819> so<00:03:25.629> it'll<00:03:25.959> be<00:03:26.109> kind<00:03:26.319> of<00:03:26.349> like<00:03:26.470> a

00:03:26.520 --> 00:03:26.530 
overhang and so it'll be kind of like a

00:03:26.530 --> 00:03:28.740 
overhang and so it'll be kind of like a
deck<00:03:26.829> area<00:03:27.310> where<00:03:27.489> you<00:03:27.579> can<00:03:27.699> put<00:03:27.879> a<00:03:27.909> chair<00:03:28.269> and

00:03:28.740 --> 00:03:28.750 
deck area where you can put a chair and

00:03:28.750 --> 00:03:31.140 
deck area where you can put a chair and
tables<00:03:29.349> and<00:03:29.620> still<00:03:29.889> have<00:03:30.040> a<00:03:30.069> covered<00:03:30.489> area<00:03:30.759> to

00:03:31.140 --> 00:03:31.150 
tables and still have a covered area to

00:03:31.150 --> 00:03:33.539 
tables and still have a covered area to
enjoy<00:03:31.689> this<00:03:32.439> is<00:03:32.590> a<00:03:32.650> piece<00:03:32.859> that<00:03:32.889> came<00:03:33.189> out<00:03:33.370> of
