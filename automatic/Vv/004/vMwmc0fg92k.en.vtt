00:03:13.640 --> 00:03:13.650 
three so looks like you've now got four

00:03:13.650 --> 00:03:15.770 
three so looks like you've now got four
cards<00:03:14.069> in<00:03:14.220> your<00:03:14.400> hand<00:03:14.819> but<00:03:15.510> you've<00:03:15.629> actually

00:03:15.770 --> 00:03:15.780

00:03:18.800 --> 00:03:18.810 
got and you actually one two three four

00:03:18.810 --> 00:03:22.250 
got and you actually one two three four
five<00:03:18.840> and<00:03:19.819> that<00:03:20.819> card<00:03:21.090> second<00:03:21.629> from<00:03:21.750> bottom<00:03:21.780> is

five and that card second from bottom is

00:03:22.260 --> 00:03:25.009 
five and that card second from bottom is
face-up<00:03:22.699> so<00:03:23.699> think<00:03:23.940> you<00:03:24.000> just<00:03:24.150> take<00:03:24.299> 24<00:03:24.720> cards
