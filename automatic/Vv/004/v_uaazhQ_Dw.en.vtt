00:00:00.350 --> 00:00:03.870
 in a case like this we told the commuter is entitled to a 

00:00:03.870 --> 00:00:04.730
 refund 

00:00:04.730 --> 00:00:09.480
 surely the Court of Cassation on the point was categorical these are the 

00:00:09.480 --> 00:00:14.340
 so-called applet smoll damage in small steel, small compensation 

00:00:14.340 --> 00:00:17.500
 modest demands that generally the consumer 

00:00:17.500 --> 00:00:22.880
 never advances however the cassation has established in the cases in which the consumer 

00:00:22.880 --> 00:00:26.360
 it has indeed turned the judicial authority has established that it is 

00:00:26.360 --> 00:00:29.540
 not only compensation for pecuniary damage but also so-called damage 

00:00:29.540 --> 00:00:33.020
 from nervousness caused by the stressful church 

00:00:33.720 --> 00:00:37.540
 be in pavia wait for the next train what can mount 

00:00:37.540 --> 00:00:41.170
 feedback generally, of course, if there is no existential damage 

00:00:41.170 --> 00:00:45.860
 the problem is determined by the judge on an equitable basis in this case 

00:00:45.859 --> 00:00:50.579
 the high replacement ride is mandatory is mandatory because it falls within the 

00:00:50.579 --> 00:00:55.609
 contractual obligations assumed by the carrier and user and therefore the carrier is 

00:00:55.609 --> 00:01:02.449
 must engage with any means add to alleviate the inconvenience not that of the user 

00:01:02.449 --> 00:01:06.370
 at that moment he is undergoing the vehicle in this case one of them 

00:01:06.369 --> 00:01:10.960
 replacement ride was mandatory even if the cancellation hee improvised 

00:01:10.960 --> 00:01:14.630
 in this case they would have to organize themselves in such a way that if there was 

00:01:14.630 --> 00:01:17.520
 a train that left there a few minutes earlier 

00:01:17.520 --> 00:01:21.940
 erbi was the possibility of waiting a few years to allow the 

00:01:21.939 --> 00:01:27.440
 commuters bite all converge on that train with a delay of over an hour to 

00:01:27.439 --> 00:01:31.310
 a nanny who normally completes the commuter about thirty minutes 

00:01:31.310 --> 00:01:35.180
 then sue the railways for damages and moral damages 

00:01:35.180 --> 00:01:37.420
 materials hoping to win it 

00:01:37.420 --> 00:01:38.330
 I would say yes 

00:01:38.330 --> 00:01:42.060
 and above all turning to a justice of the peace because the competence obviously 

00:01:42.060 --> 00:01:45.580
 values ​​will be paid in 2500 euros 

00:01:45.580 --> 00:01:49.079
 they are a modest field but maybe next time 

00:01:49.079 --> 00:01:54.319
 the railways think about it, think a little earlier and so organize 

00:01:54.319 --> 00:01:58.650
 such as to prevent in the meantime there are users to suffer discomfort
