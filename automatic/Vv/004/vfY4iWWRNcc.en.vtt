but for to make a curly you just have to
hold<00:01:07.990> in<00:01:08.170> this<00:01:08.380> way<00:01:09.840> you<00:01:10.840> can<00:01:10.990> just<00:01:11.229> flick

00:01:11.490 --> 00:01:11.500 
hold in this way you can just flick

00:01:11.500 --> 00:01:19.290 
hold in this way you can just flick
start<00:01:12.009> from<00:01:12.840> 3/4<00:01:15.180> just<00:01:16.180> like<00:01:16.420> that<00:01:18.090> grip<00:01:19.090> it

00:01:19.290 --> 00:01:19.300 
start from 3/4 just like that grip it

00:01:19.300 --> 00:01:24.540 
start from 3/4 just like that grip it
just<00:01:20.170> twist<00:01:20.530> it<00:01:20.850> and<00:01:21.850> just<00:01:22.440> good<00:01:23.440> to<00:01:24.160> us<00:01:24.250> down

00:01:24.540 --> 00:01:24.550 
just twist it and just good to us down

00:01:24.550 --> 00:01:32.270 
just twist it and just good to us down
as<00:01:25.080> slow<00:01:26.080> as<00:01:26.410> possible<00:01:28.590> till<00:01:29.590> the<00:01:29.800> tips

00:01:32.270 --> 00:01:32.280 

00:01:32.280 --> 00:01:35.270 

then<00:01:32.850> you<00:01:33.000> can<00:01:33.150> just<00:01:33.360> quickly<00:01:34.260> twist<00:01:34.770> with

00:01:35.270 --> 00:01:35.280 
then you can just quickly twist with

00:01:35.280 --> 00:01:39.410 
then you can just quickly twist with
your<00:01:35.310> finger<00:01:36.090> so<00:01:37.040> it<00:01:38.040> will<00:01:38.220> just<00:01:38.430> stay<00:01:39.240> like

00:01:39.410 --> 00:01:39.420 
your finger so it will just stay like

00:01:39.420 --> 00:01:44.180 
your finger so it will just stay like
that<00:01:41.600> the<00:01:42.600> section<00:01:43.110> should<00:01:43.320> not<00:01:43.470> be<00:01:43.650> too<00:01:43.830> thick

00:01:44.180 --> 00:01:44.190 
that the section should not be too thick

00:01:44.190 --> 00:01:47.420 
that the section should not be too thick
otherwise<00:01:44.460> it<00:01:45.060> won't<00:01:45.420> come<00:01:45.690> like<00:01:46.430> because

00:01:47.420 --> 00:01:47.430 
otherwise it won't come like because

00:01:47.430 --> 00:01:50.600 
otherwise it won't come like because
this<00:01:47.580> is<00:01:47.759> not<00:01:47.940> a<00:01:48.000> dumb<00:01:48.540> girls<00:01:48.930> it's<00:01:49.830> a<00:01:50.100> flatiron

00:01:50.600 --> 00:01:50.610 
this is not a dumb girls it's a flatiron

this is not a dumb girls it's a flatiron
so<00:01:51.390> you<00:01:51.509> making<00:01:52.200> sure<00:01:52.409> the<00:01:52.649> section<00:01:53.580> has<00:01:53.729> to<00:01:53.880> be

00:01:53.990 --> 00:01:54.000

00:02:29.330 --> 00:02:29.340 
soft curls from the ends okay just

00:02:29.340 --> 00:02:31.970 
soft curls from the ends okay just
finish<00:02:29.489> almost<00:02:29.850> all<00:02:30.300> here<00:02:30.750> no<00:02:31.500> I'm<00:02:31.800> just

00:02:31.970 --> 00:02:31.980 
finish almost all here no I'm just

00:02:31.980 --> 00:02:36.170 
finish almost all here no I'm just
showing<00:02:32.430> you<00:02:33.140> if<00:02:34.140> it's<00:02:34.440> too<00:02:35.190> lengthy<00:02:35.550> here

00:02:39.800 --> 00:02:39.810 
then the normal kind this would be like

00:02:39.810 --> 00:02:43.069 
then the normal kind this would be like
technique<00:02:40.320> we<00:02:40.560> have<00:02:40.799> to<00:02:40.950> do<00:02:41.160> I<00:02:41.690> just<00:02:42.690> show<00:02:43.049> you

00:02:43.069 --> 00:02:43.079 
technique we have to do I just show you

00:02:43.079 --> 00:02:47.810 
technique we have to do I just show you
that<00:02:43.230> how<00:02:43.709> to<00:02:43.769> do<00:02:44.220> exactly<00:02:46.250> the<00:02:47.250> same<00:02:47.280> thing

00:02:47.810 --> 00:02:47.820 
that how to do exactly the same thing

00:02:47.820 --> 00:02:51.110 
that how to do exactly the same thing
you<00:02:47.850> can<00:02:48.000> start<00:02:48.360> from<00:02:48.600> there<00:02:49.640> once<00:02:50.640> you<00:02:50.760> reach

00:02:51.110 --> 00:02:51.120 
you can start from there once you reach

00:02:51.120 --> 00:02:53.630 
you can start from there once you reach
the<00:02:51.510> middle<00:02:51.840> then<00:02:52.049> just<00:02:52.860> take<00:02:53.070> out<00:02:53.220> the<00:02:53.340> iron

00:02:53.630 --> 00:02:53.640 
the middle then just take out the iron

00:02:53.640 --> 00:02:57.710 
the middle then just take out the iron
just<00:02:54.420> twist<00:02:54.810> it<00:02:54.959> and<00:02:55.410> that<00:02:56.070> part<00:02:56.400> of<00:02:56.549> only<00:02:56.970> make

00:02:57.710 --> 00:02:57.720 
just twist it and that part of only make

00:02:57.720 --> 00:03:02.140 
just twist it and that part of only make
it<00:02:57.870> curls<00:02:58.700> and<00:02:59.700> you<00:02:59.940> start<00:03:00.630> again<00:03:00.810> down<00:03:01.290> one

00:03:02.140 --> 00:03:02.150 
it curls and you start again down one

00:03:02.150 --> 00:03:09.680 
it curls and you start again down one
those<00:03:03.150> students<00:03:03.900> here

00:03:09.680 --> 00:03:09.690 

00:03:09.690 --> 00:03:13.350 

so<00:03:10.690> what<00:03:10.930> will<00:03:11.080> happen<00:03:11.140> if<00:03:11.650> why<00:03:12.580> I'm<00:03:12.730> doing

00:03:13.350 --> 00:03:13.360 
so what will happen if why I'm doing

00:03:13.360 --> 00:03:18.750 
so what will happen if why I'm doing
this<00:03:13.660> double<00:03:14.230> time<00:03:15.330> because<00:03:17.310> we<00:03:18.310> have<00:03:18.460> to<00:03:18.580> go

00:03:18.750 --> 00:03:18.760 
this double time because we have to go

00:03:18.760 --> 00:03:20.940 
this double time because we have to go
as<00:03:18.970> slow<00:03:19.210> as<00:03:19.360> possible<00:03:20.050> from<00:03:20.290> their<00:03:20.620> route<00:03:20.920> to

00:03:20.940 --> 00:03:20.950 
as slow as possible from their route to

00:03:20.950 --> 00:03:23.790 
as slow as possible from their route to
down<00:03:21.340> and<00:03:21.610> what<00:03:22.210> will<00:03:22.360> happen<00:03:22.660> when<00:03:23.350> I<00:03:23.380> raise

00:03:23.790 --> 00:03:23.800 
down and what will happen when I raise

00:03:23.800 --> 00:03:26.580 
down and what will happen when I raise
my<00:03:24.250> hand<00:03:24.610> down<00:03:24.850> the<00:03:25.180> top<00:03:25.450> part<00:03:25.750> will<00:03:25.960> become<00:03:26.080> by

00:03:26.580 --> 00:03:26.590 
my hand down the top part will become by

00:03:26.590 --> 00:03:28.740 
my hand down the top part will become by
