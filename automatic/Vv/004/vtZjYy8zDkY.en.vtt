00:01:47.810 --> 00:01:47.820 
only tricky part of this install these

00:01:47.820 --> 00:01:49.609 
only tricky part of this install these
two<00:01:48.090> screws<00:01:48.420> and<00:01:48.630> we<00:01:48.869> actually<00:01:49.049> recommend

00:01:49.609 --> 00:01:49.619 
two screws and we actually recommend

00:01:49.619 --> 00:01:52.130 
two screws and we actually recommend
taking<00:01:49.829> a<00:01:50.310> a<00:01:50.640> small<00:01:51.420> screwdriver<00:01:51.780> or

00:01:52.130 --> 00:01:52.140

taking a a small screwdriver or
something<00:01:52.259> else<00:01:52.530> small<00:01:52.740> and<00:01:52.860> thin<00:01:53.009> and<00:01:53.189> you

00:01:53.450 --> 00:01:53.460 
something else small and thin and you

00:01:53.460 --> 00:01:55.039 
something else small and thin and you
could<00:01:53.610> use<00:01:53.790> it<00:01:53.909> to<00:01:53.939> pre<00:01:54.210> align<00:01:54.450> the<00:01:54.600> holes<00:01:54.810> and

00:01:55.039 --> 00:01:55.049 
could use it to pre align the holes and

00:01:55.049 --> 00:01:56.480 
could use it to pre align the holes and
then<00:01:55.380> once<00:01:55.590> that's<00:01:55.710> done<00:01:55.860> that's<00:01:56.130> the<00:01:56.250> only

00:01:56.480 --> 00:01:56.490
