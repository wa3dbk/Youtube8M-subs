got my julep box early this month and

00:00:04.410 --> 00:00:07.130 
got my julep box early this month and
this<00:00:04.890> is<00:00:05.040> the<00:00:05.160> April<00:00:05.580> julep<00:00:06.240> box<00:00:06.450> and<00:00:06.810> I<00:00:06.899> also

00:00:07.130 --> 00:00:07.140 
this is the April julep box and I also

00:00:07.140 --> 00:00:09.350 
this is the April julep box and I also
noticed<00:00:07.680> that<00:00:07.740> the<00:00:07.919> box<00:00:08.160> is<00:00:08.429> really<00:00:08.460> big<00:00:09.120> it's

00:00:09.350 --> 00:00:09.360 
noticed that the box is really big it's

00:00:09.360 --> 00:00:12.140 
noticed that the box is really big it's
like<00:00:09.510> twice<00:00:09.840> the<00:00:10.110> size<00:00:10.380> of<00:00:10.860> what<00:00:11.460> my<00:00:11.610> julep<00:00:11.940> box

00:00:12.140 --> 00:00:12.150 
like twice the size of what my julep box

00:00:12.150 --> 00:00:14.330 
like twice the size of what my julep box
usually<00:00:12.450> is<00:00:12.929> so<00:00:13.290> I<00:00:13.320> thought<00:00:13.620> that<00:00:13.889> was<00:00:13.980> kind<00:00:14.219> of

00:00:14.330 --> 00:00:14.340 
usually is so I thought that was kind of

00:00:14.340 --> 00:00:17.000 
usually is so I thought that was kind of
interesting<00:00:15.049> and<00:00:16.049> I<00:00:16.289> want<00:00:16.500> to<00:00:16.560> see<00:00:16.740> what's

00:00:17.000 --> 00:00:17.010 
interesting and I want to see what's

00:00:17.010 --> 00:00:20.290 
interesting and I want to see what's
inside<00:00:17.190> that's<00:00:17.670> causing<00:00:18.000> it<00:00:18.210> to<00:00:18.390> be<00:00:18.600> so<00:00:19.500> huge

00:00:20.290 --> 00:00:20.300 
inside that's causing it to be so huge

00:00:20.300 --> 00:00:24.800 
inside that's causing it to be so huge
so<00:00:21.380> this<00:00:22.380> month<00:00:22.830> the<00:00:23.250> theme<00:00:23.550> was<00:00:24.029> bright

00:00:24.800 --> 00:00:24.810 
so this month the theme was bright

00:00:24.810 --> 00:00:28.370 
so this month the theme was bright
colors<00:00:25.470> and<00:00:26.010> I<00:00:26.760> decided<00:00:27.689> to<00:00:27.779> go<00:00:27.960> with<00:00:27.990> the

00:00:28.370 --> 00:00:28.380 
colors and I decided to go with the

00:00:28.380 --> 00:00:31.279 
colors and I decided to go with the
bombshell<00:00:28.769> bugs<00:00:29.460> because<00:00:29.910> I<00:00:30.210> really<00:00:30.660> just

00:00:31.279 --> 00:00:31.289 
bombshell bugs because I really just

00:00:31.289 --> 00:00:34.370 
bombshell bugs because I really just
loved<00:00:31.740> the<00:00:32.329> electric<00:00:33.329> blue<00:00:33.690> color<00:00:34.079> that<00:00:34.170> was

00:00:34.370 --> 00:00:34.380 
loved the electric blue color that was

00:00:34.380 --> 00:00:36.950 
loved the electric blue color that was
in<00:00:34.530> this<00:00:34.680> box<00:00:35.010> and<00:00:35.460> the<00:00:35.940> raspberry<00:00:36.570> colored

00:00:36.950 --> 00:00:36.960 
in this box and the raspberry colored

00:00:36.960 --> 00:00:38.630 
in this box and the raspberry colored
one<00:00:37.200> I<00:00:37.500> already<00:00:37.649> have<00:00:37.920> some<00:00:38.190> polishes<00:00:38.610> that

00:00:38.630 --> 00:00:38.640 
one I already have some polishes that

00:00:38.640 --> 00:00:40.729 
one I already have some polishes that
are<00:00:38.850> that<00:00:39.000> color<00:00:39.300> but<00:00:39.719> it<00:00:39.870> is<00:00:39.899> a<00:00:40.110> pretty<00:00:40.469> nice

00:00:40.729 --> 00:00:40.739 
are that color but it is a pretty nice

00:00:40.739 --> 00:00:43.520 
are that color but it is a pretty nice
just<00:00:41.610> sort<00:00:41.850> of<00:00:41.940> like<00:00:42.149> everyday<00:00:42.510> color<00:00:42.989> so<00:00:43.500> I

00:00:43.520 --> 00:00:43.530 
just sort of like everyday color so I

00:00:43.530 --> 00:00:47.540 
just sort of like everyday color so I
can<00:00:43.890> always<00:00:44.010> use<00:00:44.129> more<00:00:44.460> of<00:00:44.579> that<00:00:44.760> and<00:00:46.250> okay<00:00:47.250> I

00:00:47.540 --> 00:00:47.550 
can always use more of that and okay I

00:00:47.550 --> 00:00:51.049 
can always use more of that and okay I
think<00:00:47.969> I<00:00:48.270> see<00:00:48.300> why<00:00:48.719> the<00:00:49.200> box<00:00:49.379> is<00:00:49.649> so<00:00:49.890> big<00:00:50.059> so

00:00:51.049 --> 00:00:51.059 
think I see why the box is so big so

00:00:51.059 --> 00:00:56.119 
think I see why the box is so big so
this<00:00:51.329> cuticle<00:00:51.960> serum<00:00:52.680> is<00:00:54.320> pretty<00:00:55.320> large<00:00:55.680> at

00:00:56.119 --> 00:00:56.129 
this cuticle serum is pretty large at

00:00:56.129 --> 00:00:58.160 
this cuticle serum is pretty large at
least<00:00:56.309> in<00:00:56.610> the<00:00:56.789> box<00:00:57.030> it's<00:00:57.390> pretty<00:00:57.629> large<00:00:57.870> so<00:00:58.109> I

00:00:58.160 --> 00:00:58.170 
least in the box it's pretty large so I

00:00:58.170 --> 00:00:59.450 
least in the box it's pretty large so I
think<00:00:58.350> that's<00:00:58.500> why<00:00:58.620> they<00:00:58.800> had<00:00:58.980> to<00:00:59.010> go<00:00:59.250> with<00:00:59.280> the

00:00:59.450 --> 00:00:59.460 
think that's why they had to go with the

00:00:59.460 --> 00:01:00.799 
think that's why they had to go with the
bigger<00:00:59.609> box<00:00:59.820> because<00:01:00.149> maybe<00:01:00.329> there's<00:01:00.539> smaller

00:01:00.799 --> 00:01:00.809 
bigger box because maybe there's smaller

00:01:00.809 --> 00:01:03.229 
bigger box because maybe there's smaller
boxes<00:01:01.230> it<00:01:01.410> wouldn't<00:01:01.649> fit<00:01:01.829> so<00:01:02.609> they<00:01:03.000> went<00:01:03.180> with

00:01:03.229 --> 00:01:03.239 
boxes it wouldn't fit so they went with

00:01:03.239 --> 00:01:05.479 
boxes it wouldn't fit so they went with
this<00:01:03.480> huge<00:01:04.080> box<00:01:04.350> so<00:01:04.710> we<00:01:04.830> could<00:01:05.040> get<00:01:05.189> our

00:01:05.479 --> 00:01:05.489

00:02:13.560 --> 00:02:16.370 
it definitely is making my cuticles look
less<00:02:14.069> gross<00:02:14.430> and<00:02:14.730> dry<00:02:14.940> so<00:02:15.330> that's<00:02:15.480> good<00:02:15.810> okay

00:02:16.370 --> 00:02:16.380 
less gross and dry so that's good okay

00:02:16.380 --> 00:02:19.699 
less gross and dry so that's good okay
let's<00:02:16.410> see<00:02:16.830> so<00:02:17.069> I<00:02:17.100> also<00:02:17.400> have<00:02:17.910> rock<00:02:18.810> candy<00:02:19.590> in

00:02:19.699 --> 00:02:19.709 
let's see so I also have rock candy in

00:02:19.709 --> 00:02:20.960 
let's see so I also have rock candy in
here<00:02:19.920> I<00:02:19.950> think<00:02:20.069> this<00:02:20.280> is<00:02:20.340> just<00:02:20.610> glowing<00:02:20.790> with

00:02:20.960 --> 00:02:20.970 
here I think this is just glowing with

00:02:20.970 --> 00:02:23.030 
here I think this is just glowing with
that<00:02:21.120> bright<00:02:21.420> colors<00:02:21.810> beam<00:02:22.200> and<00:02:22.740> maybe<00:02:22.890> this

00:02:23.030 --> 00:02:23.040 
that bright colors beam and maybe this

00:02:23.040 --> 00:02:24.620 
that bright colors beam and maybe this
is<00:02:23.190> another<00:02:23.459> reason<00:02:23.819> that<00:02:23.850> the<00:02:24.060> box<00:02:24.270> had<00:02:24.450> to<00:02:24.540> be

00:02:24.620 --> 00:02:24.630 
is another reason that the box had to be

00:02:24.630 --> 00:02:29.949 
is another reason that the box had to be
so<00:02:24.870> big<00:02:25.110> was<00:02:25.260> to<00:02:25.380> fit<00:02:25.620> this<00:02:25.830> little<00:02:26.790> rock<00:02:27.180> candy

00:02:29.949 --> 00:02:29.959 

00:02:29.959 --> 00:02:31.820 

so<00:02:30.959> I'm<00:02:31.020> definitely<00:02:31.170> gonna<00:02:31.410> be<00:02:31.500> trying<00:02:31.739> out

00:02:31.820 --> 00:02:31.830 
so I'm definitely gonna be trying out

00:02:31.830 --> 00:02:37.010 
so I'm definitely gonna be trying out
that<00:02:32.280> for<00:02:33.030> sure<00:02:33.300> and<00:02:34.010> now<00:02:35.120> for<00:02:36.120> the<00:02:36.569> good<00:02:36.780> stuff
