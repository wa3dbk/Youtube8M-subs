00:03:12.890 --> 00:03:12.900 
think if we looked five to ten years

00:03:12.900 --> 00:03:14.840 
think if we looked five to ten years
down<00:03:13.110> the<00:03:13.320> future<00:03:13.709> we'd<00:03:14.160> have<00:03:14.370> them<00:03:14.519> divided

00:03:14.840 --> 00:03:14.850 
down the future we'd have them divided

00:03:14.850 --> 00:03:16.640 
down the future we'd have them divided
half-and-half<00:03:15.480> because<00:03:16.230> one<00:03:16.380> of<00:03:16.410> the<00:03:16.530> most

00:03:16.640 --> 00:03:16.650 
half-and-half because one of the most

certainly<00:05:46.300> absolutely<00:05:46.509> accurate<00:05:47.139> is<00:05:47.710> because

00:05:48.270 --> 00:05:48.280 
certainly absolutely accurate is because

00:05:53.580 --> 00:05:53.590 
it's something we don't tend to think

00:05:53.590 --> 00:05:54.749 
it's something we don't tend to think
about<00:05:53.800> that
