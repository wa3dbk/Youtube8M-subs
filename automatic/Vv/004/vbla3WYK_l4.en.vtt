fantastic I'll show I would just seem to

00:01:37.770 --> 00:01:39.800 
fantastic I'll show I would just seem to
be<00:01:37.979> a<00:01:38.009> little<00:01:38.369> bit<00:01:38.880> of<00:01:39.090> the<00:01:39.240> weak<00:01:39.450> link

00:01:39.800 --> 00:01:39.810 
be a little bit of the weak link

00:01:39.810 --> 00:01:41.630 
be a little bit of the weak link
although<00:01:40.439> he<00:01:40.530> scored<00:01:40.770> plenty<00:01:41.100> goals<00:01:41.369> don't

00:01:41.630 --> 00:01:41.640 
although he scored plenty goals don't

00:01:41.640 --> 00:01:42.980 
although he scored plenty goals don't
get<00:01:41.790> me<00:01:41.880> wrong<00:01:42.060> he<00:01:42.240> just<00:01:42.270> seemed<00:01:42.720> to<00:01:42.840> be

00:01:42.980 --> 00:01:42.990 
get me wrong he just seemed to be

00:01:42.990 --> 00:01:45.109 
get me wrong he just seemed to be
slightly<00:01:43.439> weaker<00:01:44.130> than<00:01:44.399> the<00:01:44.549> others<00:01:44.909> and

00:01:45.109 --> 00:01:45.119 
slightly weaker than the others and

00:01:45.119 --> 00:01:47.179 
slightly weaker than the others and
obviously<00:01:45.899> for<00:01:46.049> the<00:01:46.259> money<00:01:46.500> I<00:01:46.590> would<00:01:46.799> probably

00:01:47.179 --> 00:01:47.189 
obviously for the money I would probably

00:01:47.189 --> 00:01:49.280 
obviously for the money I would probably
have<00:01:47.610> plumbed<00:01:48.000> Philomela<00:01:48.479> but<00:01:48.840> obviously<00:01:49.140> we

00:01:49.280 --> 00:01:49.290 
have plumbed Philomela but obviously we

00:01:49.290 --> 00:01:50.960 
have plumbed Philomela but obviously we
need<00:01:49.409> to<00:01:49.560> on<00:01:49.649> the<00:01:49.799> left<00:01:50.009> as<00:01:50.280> well<00:01:50.490> as<00:01:50.610> to<00:01:50.729> what

00:02:50.390 --> 00:02:50.400 
the replay I think just the way was

00:02:50.400 --> 00:02:52.310 
the replay I think just the way was
placed<00:02:50.670> it's<00:02:50.970> just<00:02:51.150> perfect<00:02:51.510> for<00:02:51.900> Balotelli

00:02:52.310 --> 00:02:52.320 
placed it's just perfect for Balotelli

00:02:52.320 --> 00:02:54.140

and it just opened them up an allowed

00:02:54.150 --> 00:02:56.150 
and it just opened them up an allowed
for<00:02:54.360> the<00:02:54.450> goal<00:02:54.680> this<00:02:55.680> is<00:02:55.800> looking<00:02:56.010> at

00:05:20.990 --> 00:05:21.000 
defense but he always seemed to be

00:05:21.000 --> 00:05:22.580 
defense but he always seemed to be
running<00:05:21.150> into<00:05:21.420> those<00:05:21.600> making<00:05:21.960> those<00:05:22.050> rooms<00:05:22.380> in

running into those making those rooms in

00:05:22.590 --> 00:05:24.770 
running into those making those rooms in
the<00:05:22.680> right<00:05:22.800> place<00:05:23.100> he's<00:05:23.700> had<00:05:23.820> a<00:05:23.850> great<00:05:24.030> finish

00:05:24.770 --> 00:05:24.780 
the right place he's had a great finish

00:05:24.780 --> 00:05:26.570 
the right place he's had a great finish
on<00:05:24.990> him<00:05:25.140> and<00:05:25.230> he<00:05:25.290> also<00:05:25.440> has<00:05:25.590> those<00:05:25.950> four<00:05:26.280> star
