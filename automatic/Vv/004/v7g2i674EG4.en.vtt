thing<00:00:47.789> to<00:00:47.879> talk<00:00:48.059> about<00:00:48.090> is<00:00:48.360> packaging<00:00:48.809> and<00:00:49.020> the

00:00:49.369 --> 00:00:49.379 
thing to talk about is packaging and the

00:00:49.379 --> 00:00:51.439 
thing to talk about is packaging and the
packaging<00:00:49.770> has<00:00:50.010> no<00:00:50.399> influence<00:00:50.700> on<00:00:51.090> this

00:00:51.439 --> 00:00:51.449 
packaging has no influence on this

00:00:51.449 --> 00:00:55.160 
packaging has no influence on this
review<00:00:51.719> at<00:00:51.870> all<00:00:52.079> which<00:00:52.649> for<00:00:52.860> me<00:00:52.980> is<00:00:54.170> bizarre

00:00:55.160 --> 00:00:55.170 
review at all which for me is bizarre

00:00:55.170 --> 00:00:56.630 
review at all which for me is bizarre
because<00:00:55.379> I<00:00:55.530> do<00:00:55.680> focused<00:00:56.250> quite<00:00:56.460> a<00:00:56.520> bit<00:00:56.550> on

00:00:56.630 --> 00:00:56.640 
because I do focused quite a bit on

00:00:56.640 --> 00:00:59.240 
because I do focused quite a bit on
packaging<00:00:57.030> sometimes<00:00:57.420> and<00:00:57.780> but<00:00:58.500> the

00:00:59.240 --> 00:00:59.250 
packaging sometimes and but the

00:00:59.250 --> 00:01:01.520 
packaging sometimes and but the
packaging<00:00:59.730> is<00:00:59.910> not<00:01:00.120> the<00:01:00.359> reason<00:01:00.899> I<00:01:01.109> have

00:01:01.520 --> 00:01:01.530 
packaging is not the reason I have

00:01:01.530 --> 00:01:03.170 
packaging is not the reason I have
negative<00:01:01.710> feelings<00:01:02.100> about<00:01:02.340> it<00:01:02.699> in<00:01:02.789> fact<00:01:02.969> I

00:01:03.170 --> 00:01:03.180 
negative feelings about it in fact I

00:01:03.180 --> 00:01:04.850 
negative feelings about it in fact I
quite<00:01:03.510> like<00:01:03.809> the<00:01:03.930> packaging<00:01:04.290> for<00:01:04.439> Maybelline

00:01:04.850 --> 00:01:04.860 
quite like the packaging for Maybelline

00:01:04.860 --> 00:01:06.320 
quite like the packaging for Maybelline
I<00:01:04.979> think<00:01:05.159> it's<00:01:05.250> a<00:01:05.339> bit<00:01:05.460> understated<00:01:05.850> a<00:01:06.180> bit

00:01:06.320 --> 00:01:06.330 
I think it's a bit understated a bit

00:01:06.330 --> 00:01:09.350 
I think it's a bit understated a bit
taken<00:01:06.600> back<00:01:06.720> which<00:01:07.260> are<00:01:07.500> quite<00:01:07.619> liked<00:01:07.860> and<00:01:08.360> so

00:01:09.350 --> 00:01:09.360 
taken back which are quite liked and so

00:01:09.360 --> 00:01:10.820 
taken back which are quite liked and so
it's<00:01:09.510> called<00:01:09.689> the<00:01:09.750> brow<00:01:09.960> drama<00:01:10.170> and<00:01:10.560> I<00:01:10.590> have

00:01:10.820 --> 00:01:10.830 
it's called the brow drama and I have

00:01:10.830 --> 00:01:13.340 
it's called the brow drama and I have
this<00:01:11.100> in<00:01:11.340> the<00:01:11.490> dark<00:01:11.729> brown<00:01:12.180> obviously<00:01:13.020> because

00:01:13.340 --> 00:01:13.350 
this in the dark brown obviously because

00:01:13.350 --> 00:01:14.780 
this in the dark brown obviously because
they<00:01:13.439> don't<00:01:13.590> do<00:01:13.770> black<00:01:14.040> and<00:01:14.280> even<00:01:14.610> though<00:01:14.700> my

00:01:14.780 --> 00:01:14.790 
they don't do black and even though my

00:01:14.790 --> 00:01:16.850 
they don't do black and even though my
hair<00:01:14.939> is<00:01:15.119> dark<00:01:15.420> brown<00:01:15.600> and<00:01:16.110> I<00:01:16.590> would<00:01:16.770> have

00:01:16.850 --> 00:01:16.860 
hair is dark brown and I would have

00:01:16.860 --> 00:01:18.170 
hair is dark brown and I would have
preferred<00:01:17.130> a<00:01:17.280> bit<00:01:17.430> of<00:01:17.520> a<00:01:17.580> darker<00:01:17.850> Brown<00:01:18.000> than

00:01:18.170 --> 00:01:18.180 
preferred a bit of a darker Brown than

00:01:18.180 --> 00:01:19.460 
preferred a bit of a darker Brown than
this<00:01:18.299> because<00:01:18.600> when<00:01:18.720> I<00:01:18.750> swatch<00:01:18.990> it<00:01:19.170> you'll<00:01:19.259> see

00:01:19.460 --> 00:01:19.470 
this because when I swatch it you'll see

00:01:19.470 --> 00:01:21.190 
this because when I swatch it you'll see
that<00:01:19.500> it's<00:01:19.770> actually<00:01:19.890> not<00:01:20.100> that<00:01:20.340> dark<00:01:20.549> and

00:01:21.190 --> 00:01:21.200 
that it's actually not that dark and

00:01:21.200 --> 00:01:25.929 
that it's actually not that dark and
anyway<00:01:22.200> so<00:01:22.409> this<00:01:23.400> is<00:01:23.549> a<00:01:23.580> sculpting<00:01:24.119> a<00:01:24.299> brow<00:01:24.600> gel

00:01:25.929 --> 00:01:25.939 
anyway so this is a sculpting a brow gel

00:01:25.939 --> 00:01:30.260 
anyway so this is a sculpting a brow gel
it's<00:01:27.470> the<00:01:28.470> one<00:01:28.710> is<00:01:29.040> it<00:01:29.430> looks<00:01:29.700> like<00:01:29.850> a<00:01:29.939> mascara

00:01:30.260 --> 00:01:30.270 
it's the one is it looks like a mascara

00:01:30.270 --> 00:01:32.810 
it's the one is it looks like a mascara
wand<00:01:30.450> obviously<00:01:31.170> have<00:01:31.350> the<00:01:31.500> thicker<00:01:31.740> edge<00:01:32.159> on

00:01:32.810 --> 00:01:32.820 
wand obviously have the thicker edge on

00:01:32.820 --> 00:01:35.420 
wand obviously have the thicker edge on
the<00:01:33.030> end<00:01:33.150> and<00:01:33.680> I'll<00:01:34.680> just<00:01:34.950> swatch<00:01:35.189> a<00:01:35.250> little

00:01:43.510 --> 00:01:43.520 
product it's very very shimmery and

00:01:43.520 --> 00:01:46.789 
product it's very very shimmery and
there's<00:01:44.520> just<00:01:44.670> nothing<00:01:44.970> to<00:01:45.000> it<00:01:45.619> if<00:01:46.619> you<00:01:46.770> have

very<00:01:49.380> thick<00:01:49.619> and<00:01:49.920> they<00:01:50.909> need<00:01:51.090> quite<00:01:51.329> a<00:01:51.360> bit<00:01:51.390> of

00:01:51.469 --> 00:01:51.479

00:01:51.479 --> 00:01:55.630 
very thick and they need quite a bit of
taming<00:01:51.750> then<00:01:52.170> this<00:01:52.439> is<00:01:53.119> absolutely<00:01:54.119> zero<00:01:54.439> use

00:01:55.630 --> 00:01:55.640

and there we go absolutely zero

00:03:21.990 --> 00:03:25.670 
and there we go absolutely zero
difference<00:03:22.850> and<00:03:23.850> it<00:03:24.630> feels<00:03:24.930> quite<00:03:25.170> as<00:03:25.380> sticky

00:03:25.670 --> 00:03:25.680

00:03:37.220 --> 00:03:37.230 
have to kind of fill it in a little bit

00:03:37.230 --> 00:03:40.510 
have to kind of fill it in a little bit
more<00:03:37.410> and<00:03:37.680> you<00:03:38.130> don't<00:03:38.280> need<00:03:38.520> a<00:03:38.580> lot<00:03:38.760> of<00:03:38.880> kind<00:03:39.150> of

00:03:43.590 --> 00:03:45.350 
um I guess then this might be okay for
you<00:03:43.860> but<00:03:44.160> there<00:03:44.550> are<00:03:44.580> better<00:03:44.760> ones<00:03:44.940> out<00:03:45.120> there
