00:00:58.430 --> 00:00:58.440 
messy um this is my it's a big walk-in

00:00:58.440 --> 00:01:02.630 
messy um this is my it's a big walk-in
closet<00:00:58.620> and<00:00:59.270> let<00:01:00.270> me<00:01:00.359> step<00:01:00.629> back<00:01:00.780> um<00:01:01.640> closer

00:01:02.630 --> 00:01:02.640 
closet and let me step back um closer

00:01:02.640 --> 00:01:04.939 
closet and let me step back um closer
everywhere<00:01:03.149> it's<00:01:03.870> so<00:01:04.049> roots<00:01:04.530> really

00:01:04.939 --> 00:01:04.949 
everywhere it's so roots really

00:01:04.949 --> 00:01:07.100 
everywhere it's so roots really
disorganized<00:01:05.309> and<00:01:05.850> I<00:01:06.060> don't<00:01:06.450> know<00:01:06.630> why<00:01:06.840> I'm

00:01:07.100 --> 00:01:07.110 
disorganized and I don't know why I'm

00:01:07.110 --> 00:01:08.630 
disorganized and I don't know why I'm
more<00:01:07.470> organized<00:01:07.830> that<00:01:08.070> maybe<00:01:08.369> because<00:01:08.520> i'm

00:01:08.630 --> 00:01:08.640 
more organized that maybe because i'm

00:01:08.640 --> 00:01:11.030 
more organized that maybe because i'm
too<00:01:08.760> lazy<00:01:08.909> most<00:01:09.270> of<00:01:09.390> the<00:01:09.450> time<00:01:09.770> i'll<00:01:10.770> probably

00:01:11.030 --> 00:01:11.040 
too lazy most of the time i'll probably

00:01:11.040 --> 00:01:12.740 
too lazy most of the time i'll probably
get<00:01:11.310> to<00:01:11.460> that<00:01:11.580> i<00:01:11.760> don't<00:01:11.939> know<00:01:12.000> it's<00:01:12.570> like<00:01:12.689> a

00:01:12.740 --> 00:01:12.750 
get to that i don't know it's like a

00:01:12.750 --> 00:01:14.240 
get to that i don't know it's like a
bunch<00:01:12.990> of<00:01:13.080> clothes<00:01:13.290> we<00:01:13.590> don't<00:01:13.680> even<00:01:13.979> wear

00:01:14.240 --> 00:01:14.250 
bunch of clothes we don't even wear

00:01:14.250 --> 00:01:17.660 
bunch of clothes we don't even wear
really<00:01:14.939> so<00:01:15.930> it<00:01:16.680> just<00:01:16.860> kind<00:01:17.040> of<00:01:17.100> hangs<00:01:17.310> out<00:01:17.520> in

00:01:17.660 --> 00:01:17.670 
really so it just kind of hangs out in
