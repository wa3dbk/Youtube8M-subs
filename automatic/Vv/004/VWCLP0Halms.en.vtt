00:00:00.849 --> 00:00:03.279
 before the game would be teaching 

00:00:03.279 --> 00:00:06.329
 how to create berk the priority of your motherboard 

00:00:06.930 --> 00:00:11.579
 interesting in this communist since you bought a used computer 

00:00:11.579 --> 00:00:15.099
 and this computer did not come with the misplacement of your motherboard what you 

00:00:15.099 --> 00:00:16.099
 should do 

00:00:16.099 --> 00:00:18.109
 cd v 

00:00:18.109 --> 00:00:22.650
 call for speed because week after windows 

00:00:22.650 --> 00:00:23.810
 give problem 

00:00:23.810 --> 00:00:26.850
 and you need to live the life your motherboard you will have a great pain 

00:00:26.849 --> 00:00:29.060
 If you bought me 

00:00:29.060 --> 00:00:31.489
 in the beginning of the new the new motherboard 

00:00:31.489 --> 00:00:34.729
 and you have to decide if the thermometers scoring head 

00:00:35.309 --> 00:00:37.510
 and made regions 

00:00:37.510 --> 00:00:39.580
 daoud cities 

00:00:39.580 --> 00:00:42.390
 improvements looking for a city that is not easy at all 

00:00:42.390 --> 00:00:43.690
 Fred is doing what? 

00:00:43.690 --> 00:00:47.050
 created a captain to believe in this task 

00:00:47.050 --> 00:00:48.809
 I believe this video beside 

00:00:48.809 --> 00:00:51.590
 and you can download this program here 

00:00:51.590 --> 00:00:52.940
 there may be 

00:00:52.940 --> 00:00:56.010
 I hope you can find the download link 

00:00:56.010 --> 00:00:59.430
 very sincerely with all kind of agreement with cbf looking for 

00:01:01.000 --> 00:01:02.430
 a post 

00:01:02.430 --> 00:01:07.850
 how to create the benfica was the manager's defense deÃ´la will be divided into two 

00:01:07.850 --> 00:01:13.100
 parties in how to create one of grass and another how to restore with their old 

00:01:13.100 --> 00:01:15.220
 from a sin already made 

00:01:15.220 --> 00:01:18.259
 so let's go part because it matters that the installation 

00:01:18.259 --> 00:01:22.850
 and the creation of the fire pickup in the west of his motherboard. 

00:01:22.850 --> 00:01:25.829
 then it shows that the installed program of the program 

00:01:25.829 --> 00:01:28.400
 Let's give two military clicks. 

00:01:28.400 --> 00:01:31.400
 can do and know what is to advance 

00:01:32.040 --> 00:01:34.670
 check the accept arguments option 

00:01:34.670 --> 00:01:36.310
 click here grandchildren 

00:01:36.310 --> 00:01:40.640
 but again your demand advances this part that you leave marked 

00:01:40.640 --> 00:01:42.720
 create a writer's icon 

00:01:42.720 --> 00:01:45.700
 the same room in May was there 

00:01:45.700 --> 00:01:47.310
 the installation is very fast 

00:01:47.310 --> 00:01:49.160
 I would read 

00:01:49.160 --> 00:01:53.880
 of the jihadism of your motherboard a very quick reading to finish the 

00:01:53.880 --> 00:01:56.420
 installation depends on your foundation 

00:01:56.420 --> 00:01:59.590
 currently the extraction was very fast my reading 

00:02:00.220 --> 00:02:02.530
 wood predicts live around g 

00:02:02.530 --> 00:02:04.180
 15 25 euros 

00:02:04.180 --> 00:02:06.250
 Soon I was dirty with the troika. 

00:02:06.250 --> 00:02:09.599
 we will have to score on these two fronts because it does not matter 

00:02:09.599 --> 00:02:12.349
 that you open a web page and now 

00:02:12.349 --> 00:02:13.749
 to view 

00:02:13.749 --> 00:02:14.929
 listen 

00:02:14.929 --> 00:02:16.129
 a page of the 

00:02:16.129 --> 00:02:19.290
 in the maximum driver I got marquesa two castings 

00:02:19.290 --> 00:02:22.479
 and click forward as I said here to be 

00:02:22.479 --> 00:02:25.690
 the tartar for the program you are going to do now 

00:02:25.690 --> 00:02:26.550
 and click 

00:02:26.550 --> 00:02:29.269
 two judges 

00:02:29.269 --> 00:02:31.319
 program icon 

00:02:31.319 --> 00:02:34.569
 so here is a brief presentation of the unpopular program 

00:02:34.569 --> 00:02:36.969
 jader by most popular 

00:02:36.969 --> 00:02:38.609
 the online service 

00:02:38.609 --> 00:02:41.350
 the benfica has installation of all crimes 

00:02:41.350 --> 00:02:43.650
 information or information 

00:02:43.650 --> 00:02:45.389
 so you go 

00:02:45.389 --> 00:02:50.719
 will make a mouse stroke over the net to the decat tab and there is a session of 

00:02:50.719 --> 00:02:54.059
 cct job to click here in a statement the entity 

00:02:54.059 --> 00:02:58.479
 and make a beautiful presentation here of the time that will not go to the polls delay 

00:02:58.479 --> 00:03:01.889
 usually only the setup takes so long 

00:03:01.889 --> 00:03:03.879
 You will stay here to move forward. 

00:03:03.879 --> 00:03:05.799
 and will make a brief reading 

00:03:05.799 --> 00:03:09.629
 depending on your configuration, it may take a little or no 

00:03:09.629 --> 00:03:10.929
 here it is 

00:03:10.929 --> 00:03:14.019
 every pm is there us in my 

00:03:14.019 --> 00:03:15.019
 into bed 

00:03:15.019 --> 00:03:17.600
 the important customer both the motherboard 

00:03:17.600 --> 00:03:18.739
 how daddy g 

00:03:18.739 --> 00:03:23.239
 separate plaques such as diabetes sony have no sound card already 

00:03:23.239 --> 00:03:24.639
 has a video card 

00:03:24.639 --> 00:03:26.059
 and I am 

00:03:26.059 --> 00:03:29.099
 and it shows motherboard expense are also listed here 

00:03:29.699 --> 00:03:32.759
 if you are pci audio card 

00:03:32.759 --> 00:03:33.940
 all of them 

00:03:33.940 --> 00:03:34.939
 and there you go 

00:03:34.939 --> 00:03:36.000
 I like being 

00:03:36.000 --> 00:03:38.499
 created capital that is already well 

00:03:38.499 --> 00:03:41.039
 This may be where I have it. 

00:03:41.039 --> 00:03:44.729
 all whose management is in GM the motherboard you should do 

00:03:45.269 --> 00:03:48.300
 installed on the operating system what are you going to do 

00:03:48.300 --> 00:03:51.499
 is to click this button here to select 

00:03:51.499 --> 00:03:55.180
 all diaries which is interesting for you pre-selected 

00:03:55.180 --> 00:03:56.239
 every day 

00:03:56.239 --> 00:03:57.479
 for the future is this 

00:03:57.479 --> 00:03:58.519
 the installation 

00:03:58.519 --> 00:04:02.489
 hope to stay here bingsheng hospital to select realize that these 

00:04:02.489 --> 00:04:03.469
 conductors 

00:04:03.469 --> 00:04:06.759
 will do now and be careful who sent the loop 

00:04:06.759 --> 00:04:09.189
 here is the most important part because 

00:04:09.189 --> 00:04:10.960
 Is not it interesting you? 

00:04:10.960 --> 00:04:13.260
 who were beheaded and left 

00:04:13.260 --> 00:04:17.680
 stored on cd cards against risk as if you have a problem in your 

00:04:17.680 --> 00:04:18.250
 limit 

00:04:18.250 --> 00:04:22.630
 automatically you will have all of these files clear if you do not have 

00:04:22.630 --> 00:04:27.680
 a separate faction so interesting that you record this service will not 

00:04:27.680 --> 00:04:29.840
 via or dvd 

00:04:29.840 --> 00:04:31.580
 save any location 

00:04:31.580 --> 00:04:32.440
 if you do not 

00:04:32.440 --> 00:04:34.220
 eric harris- indirect then 

00:04:34.220 --> 00:04:36.909
 temporarily create it a folder that calls 

00:04:36.909 --> 00:04:40.530
 daibes where I'm going to temporarily store pm is on display 

00:04:41.419 --> 00:04:44.219
 all the diaries on my card 

00:04:44.219 --> 00:04:47.039

 to store a location you want 

00:04:49.210 --> 00:04:50.259
 click here 

00:04:50.259 --> 00:04:55.090
 in this to 2 20 in this tenth transmitted it has a magnifying glass 

00:04:56.150 --> 00:04:57.809
 I think she carries 

00:04:57.809 --> 00:05:00.370
 and it will open a little window for you to select 

00:05:00.370 --> 00:05:01.750
 where you should have 

00:05:01.750 --> 00:05:03.439
 save next 

00:05:03.439 --> 00:05:05.210
 know how to navigate here 

00:05:05.210 --> 00:05:07.689
 I'll save nothing remember in the folder 

00:05:07.689 --> 00:05:10.050
 Braga selects so many people 

00:05:10.050 --> 00:05:12.229
 ready and with bow 

00:05:12.229 --> 00:05:14.860
 who has already changed the 

00:05:14.860 --> 00:05:16.479
 and store 

00:05:16.479 --> 00:05:17.850
 all files 

00:05:17.850 --> 00:05:21.289
 in this folder bryant you must make agreement 

00:05:21.289 --> 00:05:25.719
 I intend to stay who waited for her to quit doctor than for them our mythology 

00:05:25.719 --> 00:05:26.889
 client 

00:05:26.889 --> 00:05:28.370

 Come to bed and I'll send it to you. 

00:05:32.289 --> 00:05:33.710
 close 

00:05:33.710 --> 00:05:36.190
 and would minimize that the program remove 

00:05:36.190 --> 00:05:37.210
 a folder 

00:05:37.210 --> 00:05:38.699
 where I created 

00:05:38.699 --> 00:05:42.500
 not beneficial because all the guys who vote here the kiwi the name of dare 

00:05:42.499 --> 00:05:46.740

00:05:47.249 --> 00:05:50.430
 imagine for example that I have this hypothesis of theft 

00:05:50.430 --> 00:05:51.470
 we have given moment 

00:05:51.470 --> 00:05:52.680
 all wrong yes 

00:05:52.680 --> 00:05:54.439
 of the processor 

00:05:54.439 --> 00:05:55.939
 keyboard pain 

00:05:55.939 --> 00:06:01.159
 Bruno says that Flavio said he enrolled all the diaries in my 

00:06:01.159 --> 00:06:01.910
 motherboard 

00:06:01.910 --> 00:06:03.770
 they are loose here 

00:06:03.770 --> 00:06:06.279
 disease 

00:06:06.279 --> 00:06:07.600
 you should do 

00:06:07.600 --> 00:06:09.240
 record this here 

00:06:09.240 --> 00:06:10.740
 on the next video lesson 

00:06:10.740 --> 00:06:12.039
 and teach 

00:06:12.039 --> 00:06:13.050
 with 

00:06:13.050 --> 00:06:14.150
 to restore 

00:06:14.150 --> 00:06:15.879
 the part 

00:06:15.879 --> 00:06:20.199
 dunga and cafu made by the sports lawns is there will never be 

00:06:20.199 --> 00:06:22.419
 these imosider files 

00:06:22.419 --> 00:06:24.849
 You directly can not be there. 

00:06:24.849 --> 00:06:26.690
 seven years only see here 

00:06:26.690 --> 00:06:28.529
 the insee kunis 

00:06:28.529 --> 00:06:31.259
 xml I did type fiep system 

00:06:31.259 --> 00:06:33.389
 and these simple things of life 

00:06:33.389 --> 00:06:37.249
 barrichello is not impossible to use also the driver marques 

00:06:37.249 --> 00:06:39.619
 remembering that in the next list there 

00:06:39.619 --> 00:06:41.790
 how to restore these boys 

00:06:41.790 --> 00:06:45.760
 reminding you that you can find the program on the plunge and sincere with all 

00:06:45.760 --> 00:06:47.759
 point type with 

00:06:47.759 --> 00:06:52.990
