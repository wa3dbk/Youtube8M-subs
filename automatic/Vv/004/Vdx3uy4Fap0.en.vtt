Sharpie<00:02:08.229> pen<00:02:08.470> and<00:02:08.679> you're<00:02:09.160> going<00:02:09.310> to<00:02:09.369> trace

00:02:09.719 --> 00:02:09.729 
Sharpie pen and you're going to trace

00:02:09.729 --> 00:02:13.230 
Sharpie pen and you're going to trace
around<00:02:09.759> your<00:02:10.720> template<00:02:11.230> until<00:02:12.070> you<00:02:12.250> have<00:02:12.490> sort

00:02:13.230 --> 00:02:13.240 
around your template until you have sort

00:02:13.240 --> 00:02:15.300 
around your template until you have sort
of<00:02:13.330> like<00:02:13.480> a<00:02:13.510> rectangle<00:02:14.200> shape<00:02:14.230> but<00:02:15.040> if<00:02:15.130> your

00:02:15.300 --> 00:02:15.310 
of like a rectangle shape but if your

00:02:15.310 --> 00:02:16.680 
of like a rectangle shape but if your
lines<00:02:15.520> are<00:02:15.730> too<00:02:15.880> thin

00:02:16.680 --> 00:02:16.690 
lines are too thin

00:02:16.690 --> 00:02:18.120 
lines are too thin
you<00:02:16.750> can<00:02:16.930> just<00:02:17.170> take<00:02:17.350> the<00:02:17.530> sharpie<00:02:17.980> and

00:02:18.120 --> 00:02:18.130 
you can just take the sharpie and

00:02:18.130 --> 00:02:20.550 
you can just take the sharpie and
retrace<00:02:18.760> over<00:02:19.120> the<00:02:19.240> lines<00:02:19.450> you<00:02:19.690> did<00:02:19.870> to<00:02:20.410> give

00:02:20.550 --> 00:02:20.560 
retrace over the lines you did to give

00:02:20.560 --> 00:02:23.040 
retrace over the lines you did to give
it<00:02:20.680> a<00:02:20.740> thicker<00:02:20.980> shape<00:02:21.280> like<00:02:21.520> this<00:02:21.870> now<00:02:22.870> you're

00:02:23.040 --> 00:02:23.050 
it a thicker shape like this now you're

00:02:23.050 --> 00:02:24.990 
it a thicker shape like this now you're
gonna<00:02:23.140> take<00:02:23.440> your<00:02:23.590> cup<00:02:23.830> flip<00:02:24.160> it<00:02:24.280> 180<00:02:24.670> degrees

00:02:24.990 --> 00:02:25.000 
gonna take your cup flip it 180 degrees

00:02:25.000 --> 00:02:27.330 
gonna take your cup flip it 180 degrees
make<00:02:25.810> sure<00:02:25.990> that<00:02:26.200> the<00:02:26.380> top<00:02:26.620> and<00:02:26.830> bottom<00:02:27.130> of<00:02:27.220> the

you're gonna take your pen and just as
before<00:02:32.050> you're<00:02:32.410> gonna<00:02:32.560> trace<00:02:32.920> around<00:02:33.160> all

00:02:33.660 --> 00:02:33.670 
before you're gonna trace around all

00:02:33.670 --> 00:02:37.800 
before you're gonna trace around all
four<00:02:34.030> sides<00:02:34.890> then<00:02:35.890> if<00:02:36.160> need<00:02:36.400> be<00:02:36.430> you<00:02:36.850> take<00:02:37.660> the

00:02:37.800 --> 00:02:37.810 
four sides then if need be you take the

00:02:37.810 --> 00:02:40.560 
four sides then if need be you take the
pen<00:02:38.050> resharpen<00:02:39.010> order<00:02:39.820> to<00:02:39.910> make<00:02:40.060> it<00:02:40.210> thicker<00:02:40.450> I

00:02:40.560 --> 00:02:40.570 
pen resharpen order to make it thicker I

00:02:40.570 --> 00:02:42.990 
pen resharpen order to make it thicker I
mean<00:02:40.840> and<00:02:41.020> then<00:02:41.650> you'll<00:02:42.010> get<00:02:42.250> your<00:02:42.550> second

00:02:42.990 --> 00:02:43.000 
mean and then you'll get your second

00:02:43.000 --> 00:02:45.750 
mean and then you'll get your second
rectangle<00:02:43.780> shape<00:02:44.350> one<00:02:45.040> in<00:02:45.190> the<00:02:45.310> front<00:02:45.550> and

then one exactly opposite on the back
now<00:02:49.270> in<00:02:49.570> between<00:02:49.990> those<00:02:50.200> two<00:02:50.410> shapes<00:02:50.710> place

00:02:51.120 --> 00:02:51.130 
now in between those two shapes place

00:02:51.130 --> 00:02:53.100 
now in between those two shapes place
your<00:02:51.370> template<00:02:51.760> again<00:02:52.060> make<00:02:52.630> sure<00:02:52.810> it's<00:02:52.990> the

unless you use a fat pen then you only

00:03:01.690 --> 00:03:04.110 
unless you use a fat pen then you only
have<00:03:01.870> to<00:03:01.990> draw<00:03:02.170> it<00:03:02.260> once<00:03:02.530> and<00:03:02.800> then<00:03:03.310> take<00:03:03.610> for

00:03:04.110 --> 00:03:04.120 
have to draw it once and then take for

00:03:04.120 --> 00:03:06.800 
have to draw it once and then take for
the<00:03:04.210> fourth<00:03:04.480> and<00:03:04.690> last<00:03:04.810> time<00:03:05.170> your<00:03:05.950> template
