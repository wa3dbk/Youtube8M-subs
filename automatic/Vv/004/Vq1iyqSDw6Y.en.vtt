00:00:07.730 --> 00:00:12.630
 one of my gastronomic memories 

00:00:09.780 --> 00:00:14.730
 older was the desire to leave 

00:00:12.630 --> 00:00:17.880
 running every time someone spoke in 

00:00:14.730 --> 00:00:20.789
 Like any child I thought 

00:00:17.880 --> 00:00:22.439
 this bitter and bland legume but mine 

00:00:20.789 --> 00:00:25.710
 Mom learned a little way to bend me. 

00:00:22.439 --> 00:00:28.619
 with a simple and refreshing recipe the 

00:00:25.710 --> 00:00:30.689
 Eggplant pickle I'm going to enjoy 

00:00:28.619 --> 00:00:37.020
 What is a heat to kill this? 

00:00:30.689 --> 00:00:38.399
 Longing I'll get two ripe eggplants 

00:00:37.020 --> 00:00:44.430
 and good size 

00:00:38.399 --> 00:00:47.309
 took the tips and sliced ​​well 

00:00:44.430 --> 00:00:49.430
 thin and long as if it were 

00:00:47.309 --> 00:00:49.430
 lasagna 

00:00:50.329 --> 00:00:55.649
 At this moment I'm going to draw a trick 

00:00:53.010 --> 00:00:58.289
 very simple to take away the bitterness of 

00:00:55.649 --> 00:01:00.960
 eggplant just dip the slices in 

00:00:58.289 --> 00:01:03.449
 water at room temperature for 15 

00:01:00.960 --> 00:01:06.619
 minutes while it is soaking I go 

00:01:03.449 --> 00:01:06.619
 prepare the other ingredients 

00:01:12.320 --> 00:01:19.979
 ready already given 15 minutes and I'll 

00:01:14.970 --> 00:01:22.830
 drain the bullet eggplants and look at the 

00:01:19.979 --> 00:01:24.659
 last romantic after the eggplant 

00:01:22.830 --> 00:01:27.060
 drain well to cool 

00:01:24.659 --> 00:01:30.450
 It's time to assemble the pickle I go. 

00:01:27.060 --> 00:01:33.570
 to alternate layers of speckled eggplant 

00:01:30.450 --> 00:01:37.950
 with the olive onion and the 

00:01:33.570 --> 00:01:40.890
 bay leaves and seasoned with salt and olive oil 

00:01:37.950 --> 00:01:44.070
 most important of pickled vinegar 

00:01:40.890 --> 00:01:45.830
 by the way, means vinegar, is this 

00:01:44.070 --> 00:01:47.729
 that will give that acid touch 

00:01:45.830 --> 00:01:51.420
 characteristics and conserve food 

00:01:47.729 --> 00:01:53.100
 a pinch of oregano and the 

00:01:51.420 --> 00:01:55.920
 service is completed 

00:01:53.100 --> 00:01:58.920
 only here comes the flat part the pickle 

00:01:55.920 --> 00:02:01.830
 it will only be ready even after 

00:01:58.920 --> 00:02:06.090
 at least five days marinating in the refrigerator 

00:02:01.830 --> 00:02:10.729
 but look what a spectacular robbery and already 

00:02:06.090 --> 00:02:10.729
 had left another portion prepared 

00:02:12.390 --> 00:02:17.920
 now that time has purged the aromas and 

00:02:15.190 --> 00:02:23.370
 head tastes just add 

00:02:17.920 --> 00:02:23.370
 slices of very crispy bread and sticking
