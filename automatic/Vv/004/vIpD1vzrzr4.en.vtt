there you go so you handicapped yourself

00:01:23.220 --> 00:01:23.840 
there you go so you handicapped yourself
sometimes

00:01:23.840 --> 00:01:23.850 
sometimes

00:01:23.850 --> 00:01:25.370 
sometimes
when<00:01:24.420> you<00:01:24.510> have<00:01:24.660> that<00:01:24.810> so<00:01:24.990> this<00:01:25.140> is<00:01:25.260> where

00:01:25.370 --> 00:01:25.380 
when you have that so this is where

00:01:25.380 --> 00:01:27.080 
when you have that so this is where
sometimes<00:01:25.590> we<00:01:25.770> need<00:01:25.950> to<00:01:26.100> just<00:01:26.280> work<00:01:26.910> a

00:01:27.080 --> 00:01:27.090 
sometimes we need to just work a

00:01:27.090 --> 00:01:31.040 
sometimes we need to just work a
principle<00:01:28.820> for<00:01:29.820> both<00:01:30.000> of<00:01:30.180> you<00:01:30.300> see<00:01:30.540> I<00:01:30.690> think<00:01:30.960> a

00:01:31.040 --> 00:01:31.050 
principle for both of you see I think a

00:01:31.050 --> 00:01:35.810 
principle for both of you see I think a
lot<00:01:31.200> of<00:01:31.229> times<00:01:33.950> so<00:01:34.950> we're<00:01:35.070> gonna<00:01:35.190> we're<00:01:35.670> going

00:01:35.810 --> 00:01:35.820 
lot of times so we're gonna we're going

00:01:35.820 --> 00:01:38.090 
lot of times so we're gonna we're going
to<00:01:35.880> do<00:01:36.000> this<00:01:36.120> till<00:01:36.300> he<00:01:36.450> can<00:01:37.229> get<00:01:37.380> some<00:01:37.590> some

to do this till he can get some some

00:01:38.100 --> 00:01:43.090 
to do this till he can get some some
relief<00:01:38.759> by<00:01:39.380> kind<00:01:40.380> of<00:01:40.470> hanging<00:01:40.770> in<00:01:40.860> here

00:02:19.769 --> 00:02:21.590 
look manageable to me you know yeah like
you<00:02:19.950> said<00:02:19.980> as<00:02:20.790> long<00:02:20.970> as<00:02:21.030> you<00:02:21.209> didn't<00:02:21.450> have<00:02:21.570> a

00:02:21.590 --> 00:02:21.600 
you said as long as you didn't have a

00:02:21.600 --> 00:02:23.660 
you said as long as you didn't have a
carrot<00:02:21.870> stick<00:02:21.989> in<00:02:22.200> your<00:02:22.290> hand<00:02:22.500> and<00:02:22.739> you've

00:02:25.160 --> 00:02:25.170 
probably got a better chance so this is

00:02:25.170 --> 00:02:28.400 
probably got a better chance so this is
where<00:02:25.730> sometimes<00:02:26.780> you<00:02:27.780> can<00:02:27.930> partner<00:02:28.170> up<00:02:28.380> with

00:02:28.400 --> 00:02:28.410
