00:00:01.110 --> 00:00:07.800
 good friends of the forum then nothing leave me 

00:00:05.580 --> 00:00:11.120
 since we have finished 

00:00:07.800 --> 00:00:11.120
 in x gloves 

00:00:12.420 --> 00:00:16.760
 he taught the hands you are going to flip 

00:00:14.990 --> 00:00:19.160
 I have more black than coal 

00:00:16.760 --> 00:00:21.770
 after having cut the shit is 

00:00:19.160 --> 00:00:24.590
 of the rope to do the tests 

00:00:21.770 --> 00:00:28.520
 look at what hands more guardians my mother 

00:00:24.590 --> 00:00:30.320
 what a shame but good good this 

00:00:28.520 --> 00:00:33.650
 video is that of the reflections about 

00:00:30.320 --> 00:00:35.180
 of the knife as we have seen the first 

00:00:33.650 --> 00:00:37.010
 The test of the strings has cut them 

00:00:35.180 --> 00:00:40.690
 all perfectly I have not had any 

00:00:37.010 --> 00:00:43.539
 kind of glue as soon as 

00:00:40.690 --> 00:00:45.820
 as for the boat rope he has 

00:00:43.539 --> 00:00:47.559
 cost even believe it to me that I am 

00:00:45.820 --> 00:00:50.680
 the one that I'm doing the tests 

00:00:47.559 --> 00:00:54.280
 because it has been without a doubt until 

00:00:50.680 --> 00:00:56.780
 now the cutting speed record of 

00:00:54.280 --> 00:00:58.600
 this rope has been spectacular 

00:00:56.780 --> 00:01:00.460
 and 

00:00:58.600 --> 00:01:02.649
 the baton and also has exceeded 

00:01:00.460 --> 00:01:06.340
 perfectly without any kind of 

00:01:02.649 --> 00:01:09.310
 problem and what would be the proof of 

00:01:06.340 --> 00:01:11.649
 wood, well, yes, I've noticed myself 

00:01:09.310 --> 00:01:14.080
 the feeling that maybe the wood is going 

00:01:11.649 --> 00:01:15.759
 to work the wood is not your strong or 

00:01:14.080 --> 00:01:17.950
 At least I think it's not your strong 

00:01:15.759 --> 00:01:19.600
 because the feeling I've had has 

00:01:17.950 --> 00:01:22.659
 been that yes it does 

00:01:19.600 --> 00:01:27.000
 perfectly fine but maybe 

00:01:22.659 --> 00:01:27.000
 it was a bit hard to bite 

00:01:27.670 --> 00:01:32.080
 well there are knives that precisely 

00:01:30.729 --> 00:01:34.630
 Well, that's what happens to them. 

00:01:32.080 --> 00:01:37.299
 for general cuts whatever they are 

00:01:34.630 --> 00:01:38.590
 perfect and then in the wood then 

00:01:37.299 --> 00:01:40.960
 good 

00:01:38.590 --> 00:01:43.210
 they defend this has been defended more 

00:01:40.960 --> 00:01:47.890
 that correctly what happens is that 

00:01:43.210 --> 00:01:49.090
 example if I remember now the hedgehog not 

00:01:47.890 --> 00:01:51.609
 I remember 

00:01:49.090 --> 00:01:54.060
 fuck is that I've done so many times 

00:01:51.609 --> 00:01:54.060
 agreement 

00:01:54.220 --> 00:01:59.050
 well I do not know about lmt one for example by 

00:01:57.730 --> 00:02:00.670
 example the mt one is a logger 

00:01:59.050 --> 00:02:03.790
 fucking 

00:02:00.670 --> 00:02:05.380
 Well, hey, I think it's a bit 

00:02:03.790 --> 00:02:10.030
 below in terms of logging tasks 

00:02:05.380 --> 00:02:13.090
 but honestly I thought it was a 

00:02:10.030 --> 00:02:15.790
 fantastic knife 

00:02:13.090 --> 00:02:18.640
 the price I think is around the 

00:02:15.790 --> 00:02:21.970
 sixty-odd and seventy-odd euros 

00:02:18.640 --> 00:02:23.920
 and hey I see it pretty a knife 

00:02:21.970 --> 00:02:27.190
 even pretty defense field 

00:02:23.920 --> 00:02:29.470
 managed as I said perhaps what 

00:02:27.190 --> 00:02:31.750
 I would have done 

00:02:29.470 --> 00:02:33.319
 it would have been to take away a little weight 

00:02:31.750 --> 00:02:36.980
 of the ass 

00:02:33.319 --> 00:02:39.590
 and lower a little 

00:02:36.980 --> 00:02:41.269
 what would be the width of shovel but is 

00:02:39.590 --> 00:02:43.069
 that we are talking about that is not a 

00:02:41.269 --> 00:02:45.739
 knife made for me that is a 

00:02:43.069 --> 00:02:49.690
 knife that for any user the 

00:02:45.739 --> 00:02:52.020
 truth is that it still has a cutting edge 

00:02:49.690 --> 00:02:53.550
 very very good 

00:02:52.020 --> 00:02:55.819
 Y 

00:02:53.550 --> 00:02:58.430
 today that is the partridge 

00:02:55.819 --> 00:03:01.010
 today the partridge or not 

00:02:58.430 --> 00:03:04.519
 is that he is using a partridge 

00:03:01.010 --> 00:03:07.459
 and he has not had an average nor has he had 

00:03:04.519 --> 00:03:09.069
 nothing what is the sheet geometry in 

00:03:07.459 --> 00:03:11.170
 how much to cut 

00:03:09.069 --> 00:03:14.709
 I would be scared to give me a stake 

00:03:11.170 --> 00:03:17.170
 with this because we are going to stop what 

00:03:14.709 --> 00:03:19.970
 cuts in a spectacular way arriving 

00:03:17.170 --> 00:03:22.610
 as they say to the kitchen 

00:03:19.970 --> 00:03:24.860
 Well, I do not expect you to like the 

00:03:22.610 --> 00:03:28.970
 tests I have had a great time as 

00:03:24.860 --> 00:03:32.440
 always and nothing to comment that the knife 

00:03:28.970 --> 00:03:32.440
 in itself it seems very good to me 

00:03:33.260 --> 00:03:38.480
 and we are going that as always it will be what 

00:03:36.080 --> 00:03:41.299
 we are able to do with him the 

00:03:38.480 --> 00:03:43.489
 knife alone will not cut anything but 

00:03:41.299 --> 00:03:46.129
 that we go that anyone who 

00:03:43.489 --> 00:03:47.689
 buy for your field days I 

00:03:46.129 --> 00:03:50.980
 I think you'll be more than satisfied 

00:03:47.689 --> 00:03:53.680
 he sees it to a very very very good product 

00:03:50.980 --> 00:03:55.360
 Until now, comrades are already talking to me 

00:03:53.680 --> 00:03:58.000
 see if you liked the tests if you 

00:03:55.360 --> 00:03:59.590
 have liked my reflections if I have 

00:03:58.000 --> 00:04:03.400
 wrong in something or plea for 

00:03:59.590 --> 00:04:06.720
 Please tell me why I'm not 

00:04:03.400 --> 00:04:08.520
 no expert on anything to the contrary 

00:04:06.720 --> 00:04:11.130
 I learn more and I with you 

00:04:08.520 --> 00:04:13.500
 you from me that I can assure you 

00:04:11.130 --> 00:04:17.190
 and nothing just send us a greeting and 

00:04:13.500 --> 00:04:19.730
 we'll see each other and we 're talking 

00:04:17.190 --> 00:04:19.730
 now friends
