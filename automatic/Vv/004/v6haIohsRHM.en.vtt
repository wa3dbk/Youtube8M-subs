00:00:08.210 --> 00:00:08.220 
suited to a tee I shadow palette so when

00:00:08.220 --> 00:00:10.580 
suited to a tee I shadow palette so when
I<00:00:08.309> first<00:00:08.580> saw<00:00:08.820> this<00:00:09.120> I<00:00:09.179> had<00:00:09.870> to<00:00:10.170> have<00:00:10.380> it

00:00:10.580 --> 00:00:10.590 
I first saw this I had to have it

00:00:10.590 --> 00:00:13.009 
I first saw this I had to have it
because<00:00:11.460> I<00:00:11.759> found<00:00:12.030> out<00:00:12.210> that<00:00:12.360> it's<00:00:12.509> actually<00:00:12.750> a

00:00:13.009 --> 00:00:13.019 
because I found out that it's actually a

00:00:13.019 --> 00:00:15.740 
because I found out that it's actually a
cream<00:00:13.469> eyeshadow<00:00:14.130> palette<00:00:14.670> the<00:00:15.089> packaging<00:00:15.630> is

00:00:15.740 --> 00:00:15.750 
cream eyeshadow palette the packaging is

00:00:15.750 --> 00:00:18.529 
cream eyeshadow palette the packaging is
very<00:00:15.780> cute<00:00:16.500> but<00:00:17.130> the<00:00:17.670> first<00:00:17.910> thing<00:00:18.060> I<00:00:18.180> noticed

00:00:18.529 --> 00:00:18.539 
very cute but the first thing I noticed

00:00:18.539 --> 00:00:20.750 
very cute but the first thing I noticed
when<00:00:18.600> I<00:00:18.720> very<00:00:18.779> first<00:00:19.020> got<00:00:19.500> it<00:00:19.710> it<00:00:19.890> does<00:00:20.730> not

00:00:20.750 --> 00:00:20.760 
when I very first got it it does not

00:00:20.760 --> 00:00:22.460 
when I very first got it it does not
close<00:00:21.270> all<00:00:21.510> the<00:00:21.630> way<00:00:21.750> so<00:00:22.050> I<00:00:22.109> was<00:00:22.260> concerned

00:00:22.460 --> 00:00:22.470 
close all the way so I was concerned

00:00:22.470 --> 00:00:25.700 
close all the way so I was concerned
that<00:00:22.890> the<00:00:23.670> cream<00:00:23.910> eyeshadows<00:00:24.539> over<00:00:24.840> time<00:00:25.109> may

00:00:25.700 --> 00:00:25.710 
that the cream eyeshadows over time may

00:00:25.710 --> 00:00:28.220 
that the cream eyeshadows over time may
dry<00:00:26.070> out<00:00:26.099> so<00:00:26.880> I<00:00:26.910> wasn't<00:00:27.119> happy<00:00:27.390> about<00:00:27.539> that<00:00:27.960> and

00:00:28.220 --> 00:00:28.230 
dry out so I wasn't happy about that and

00:00:28.230 --> 00:00:30.740 
dry out so I wasn't happy about that and
there's<00:00:28.830> no<00:00:29.039> magnetic<00:00:30.000> enclosure<00:00:30.300> or

00:00:30.740 --> 00:00:30.750 
there's no magnetic enclosure or

00:00:30.750 --> 00:00:32.659 
there's no magnetic enclosure or
anything<00:00:31.140> so<00:00:31.590> it<00:00:31.679> doesn't<00:00:31.980> close<00:00:32.130> all<00:00:32.369> the<00:00:32.489> way

00:00:32.659 --> 00:00:32.669 
anything so it doesn't close all the way

00:00:32.669 --> 00:00:35.209 
anything so it doesn't close all the way
and<00:00:33.290> as<00:00:34.290> you<00:00:34.440> can<00:00:34.590> even<00:00:34.680> see<00:00:34.920> there's<00:00:35.100> like<00:00:35.160> a

00:00:35.209 --> 00:00:35.219 
and as you can even see there's like a

00:00:35.219 --> 00:00:38.150 
and as you can even see there's like a
huge<00:00:35.550> space<00:00:35.910> right<00:00:36.239> here<00:00:36.480> so<00:00:37.290> that<00:00:37.950> already

00:00:38.150 --> 00:00:38.160 
huge space right here so that already

00:00:38.160 --> 00:00:39.590 
huge space right here so that already
right<00:00:38.579> away<00:00:38.760> I<00:00:38.790> was<00:00:38.969> like<00:00:39.120> well<00:00:39.239> that's<00:00:39.329> not<00:00:39.480> a

00:00:39.590 --> 00:00:39.600 
right away I was like well that's not a

00:00:39.600 --> 00:00:41.840 
right away I was like well that's not a
good<00:00:39.809> sign<00:00:40.079> so<00:00:41.010> you<00:00:41.070> open<00:00:41.399> it<00:00:41.489> up<00:00:41.640> you've<00:00:41.820> got

00:00:41.840 --> 00:00:41.850 
good sign so you open it up you've got

00:00:41.850 --> 00:00:44.569 
good sign so you open it up you've got
your<00:00:42.000> mirror<00:00:42.360> and<00:00:43.100> it<00:00:44.100> comes<00:00:44.340> with<00:00:44.520> a

00:00:44.569 --> 00:00:44.579 
your mirror and it comes with a

00:00:44.579 --> 00:00:46.880 
your mirror and it comes with a
double-ended<00:00:44.969> brush<00:00:45.149> and<00:00:45.870> I<00:00:46.620> thought<00:00:46.739> this

00:00:46.880 --> 00:00:46.890 
double-ended brush and I thought this

00:00:46.890 --> 00:00:48.850 
double-ended brush and I thought this
was<00:00:47.100> interesting<00:00:47.280> and<00:00:47.820> it<00:00:47.879> makes<00:00:48.059> more<00:00:48.270> sense

00:00:48.850 --> 00:00:48.860 
was interesting and it makes more sense

00:00:48.860 --> 00:00:51.650 
was interesting and it makes more sense
although<00:00:49.860> this<00:00:50.010> is<00:00:50.160> all<00:00:50.309> cardboard<00:00:50.969> the

00:00:51.650 --> 00:00:51.660 
although this is all cardboard the

00:00:51.660 --> 00:00:53.660 
although this is all cardboard the
actual<00:00:52.020> tray<00:00:52.320> that<00:00:52.590> holds<00:00:53.070> all<00:00:53.219> the<00:00:53.370> cream

00:00:53.660 --> 00:00:53.670 
actual tray that holds all the cream

00:00:53.670 --> 00:00:56.900 
actual tray that holds all the cream
colors<00:00:54.149> is<00:00:54.770> plastic<00:00:55.770> which<00:00:56.309> I<00:00:56.489> guess<00:00:56.699> makes

00:00:56.900 --> 00:00:56.910 
colors is plastic which I guess makes

00:00:56.910 --> 00:01:00.380 
colors is plastic which I guess makes
more<00:00:57.180> sense<00:00:57.539> because<00:00:58.879> that's<00:00:59.879> just<00:01:00.180> the<00:01:00.300> way

00:01:00.380 --> 00:01:00.390 
more sense because that's just the way

00:01:00.390 --> 00:01:01.939 
more sense because that's just the way
they<00:01:00.600> needed<00:01:00.840> to<00:01:01.109> store<00:01:01.410> the<00:01:01.739> cream

00:01:01.939 --> 00:01:01.949 
they needed to store the cream

00:01:01.949 --> 00:01:05.119 
they needed to store the cream
eyeshadows<00:01:02.489> I<00:01:02.699> guess<00:01:03.080> but<00:01:04.080> the<00:01:04.559> colors<00:01:04.920> I

00:01:05.119 --> 00:01:05.129 
eyeshadows I guess but the colors I

00:01:05.129 --> 00:01:06.620 
eyeshadows I guess but the colors I
thought<00:01:05.339> it<00:01:05.430> was<00:01:05.519> a<00:01:05.549> really<00:01:05.850> pretty<00:01:06.090> selection

00:01:06.620 --> 00:01:06.630 
thought it was a really pretty selection

00:01:06.630 --> 00:01:08.300 
thought it was a really pretty selection
of<00:01:06.720> colors<00:01:07.140> you<00:01:07.320> have<00:01:07.470> long<00:01:07.650> new<00:01:07.860> tools<00:01:08.130> and

00:01:08.300 --> 00:01:08.310 
of colors you have long new tools and

00:01:08.310 --> 00:01:11.149 
of colors you have long new tools and

recommend that you use as lip and cheek

00:01:13.560 --> 00:01:16.160 
recommend that you use as lip and cheek
colors<00:01:14.070> that<00:01:14.850> would<00:01:15.030> be<00:01:15.150> blooms<00:01:15.479> very<00:01:15.810> right

00:01:16.160 --> 00:01:16.170 
colors that would be blooms very right

00:01:16.170 --> 00:01:20.719 
colors that would be blooms very right
here<00:01:16.619> and<00:01:16.880> then<00:01:17.880> also<00:01:18.090> macaron<00:01:18.750> so<00:01:19.549> first<00:01:20.549> off

00:01:20.719 --> 00:01:20.729 
here and then also macaron so first off

00:01:20.729 --> 00:01:22.670 
here and then also macaron so first off
the<00:01:20.820> problem<00:01:21.030> of<00:01:21.210> those<00:01:21.390> two<00:01:21.750> is<00:01:22.020> bloomsbury

00:01:22.670 --> 00:01:22.680 
the problem of those two is bloomsbury

00:01:22.680 --> 00:01:25.280 
the problem of those two is bloomsbury
although<00:01:23.100> it<00:01:23.369> has<00:01:23.610> a<00:01:23.850> lipstick<00:01:24.420> consistency

00:01:25.280 --> 00:01:25.290 
although it has a lipstick consistency

00:01:25.290 --> 00:01:28.850 
although it has a lipstick consistency
this<00:01:25.950> is<00:01:26.220> a<00:01:26.250> shade<00:01:26.670> that<00:01:26.700> reads<00:01:27.860> outrageously

00:01:28.850 --> 00:01:28.860 
this is a shade that reads outrageously

00:01:28.860 --> 00:01:31.910 
this is a shade that reads outrageously
nude<00:01:29.400> when<00:01:30.000> I<00:01:30.030> tried<00:01:30.450> it<00:01:30.479> on<00:01:30.689> my<00:01:30.869> lips<00:01:31.140> it<00:01:31.860> looks

00:01:31.910 --> 00:01:31.920 
nude when I tried it on my lips it looks

00:01:31.920 --> 00:01:36.560 
nude when I tried it on my lips it looks
almost<00:01:32.729> like<00:01:33.060> concealer<00:01:33.840> and<00:01:34.250> not<00:01:35.250> all<00:01:35.759> people

00:01:36.560 --> 00:01:36.570 
almost like concealer and not all people

00:01:36.570 --> 00:01:39.679 
almost like concealer and not all people
like<00:01:37.049> that<00:01:37.860> shade<00:01:38.310> of<00:01:38.340> lip<00:01:38.670> color<00:01:38.700> so<00:01:39.299> I<00:01:39.360> found

00:01:39.679 --> 00:01:39.689 
like that shade of lip color so I found

00:01:39.689 --> 00:01:41.630 
like that shade of lip color so I found
it<00:01:39.840> strange<00:01:40.020> that<00:01:40.380> they<00:01:40.650> selected<00:01:41.340> a<00:01:41.400> color

00:01:41.630 --> 00:01:41.640 
it strange that they selected a color

00:01:41.640 --> 00:01:43.880 
it strange that they selected a color
that<00:01:42.060> is<00:01:42.479> not<00:01:42.899> a<00:01:42.930> very<00:01:43.140> universally

00:01:43.880 --> 00:01:43.890 
that is not a very universally

00:01:43.890 --> 00:01:46.550 
that is not a very universally
flattering<00:01:44.100> color<00:01:44.720> to<00:01:45.720> be<00:01:45.869> one<00:01:46.110> of<00:01:46.259> the<00:01:46.350> lip

00:01:46.550 --> 00:01:46.560 
flattering color to be one of the lip

00:01:46.560 --> 00:01:49.190 
flattering color to be one of the lip
colors<00:01:47.070> and<00:01:47.430> also<00:01:48.060> forget<00:01:48.630> about<00:01:48.720> trying<00:01:48.990> to

00:01:49.190 --> 00:01:49.200 
colors and also forget about trying to

00:01:49.200 --> 00:01:52.069 
colors and also forget about trying to
put<00:01:49.380> it<00:01:49.500> on<00:01:49.619> your<00:01:49.829> cheeks<00:01:50.159> it<00:01:51.060> just<00:01:51.420> for<00:01:51.960> me

00:01:52.069 --> 00:01:52.079 
put it on your cheeks it just for me

00:01:52.079 --> 00:01:54.800 
put it on your cheeks it just for me
this<00:01:52.259> would<00:01:52.409> not<00:01:52.530> work<00:01:52.770> as<00:01:53.009> a<00:01:53.369> lip<00:01:53.939> color<00:01:54.119> or<00:01:54.450> a

00:01:54.800 --> 00:01:54.810 
this would not work as a lip color or a

00:01:54.810 --> 00:01:58.280 
this would not work as a lip color or a
cheek<00:01:55.229> color<00:01:55.530> and<00:01:56.119> then<00:01:57.119> macaron<00:01:57.659> again<00:01:58.110> it's

00:01:58.280 --> 00:01:58.290 
cheek color and then macaron again it's

00:01:58.290 --> 00:02:00.230 
cheek color and then macaron again it's
really<00:01:58.560> pretty<00:01:58.770> it's<00:01:58.950> more<00:01:59.280> of<00:01:59.369> a<00:01:59.430> frosty<00:01:59.939> pink

00:02:00.230 --> 00:02:00.240 
really pretty it's more of a frosty pink

00:02:00.240 --> 00:02:02.899 
really pretty it's more of a frosty pink
but<00:02:00.570> when<00:02:00.689> I<00:02:00.719> put<00:02:00.990> it<00:02:01.049> on<00:02:01.110> my<00:02:01.290> lips<00:02:01.619> it<00:02:01.950> has<00:02:02.640> a

but when I put it on my lips it has a

00:02:02.909 --> 00:02:05.330 
but when I put it on my lips it has a
cream<00:02:03.600> eyeshadow<00:02:03.960> texture<00:02:04.829> too<00:02:04.950> it's<00:02:05.130> a<00:02:05.159> very

cream eyeshadow texture too it's a very

00:02:05.340 --> 00:02:07.580 
cream eyeshadow texture too it's a very
dry<00:02:05.670> texture<00:02:06.299> it<00:02:06.570> gathers<00:02:06.930> in<00:02:07.140> the<00:02:07.170> lines<00:02:07.439> of

00:02:07.580 --> 00:02:07.590 
dry texture it gathers in the lines of

00:02:11.900 --> 00:02:11.910 
total fail when I tried wearing this on

00:02:11.910 --> 00:02:12.300 
total fail when I tried wearing this on
my

00:02:12.300 --> 00:02:12.310 
my

my
the<00:02:12.550> cheek<00:02:12.819> color<00:02:13.060> it's<00:02:13.330> so<00:02:13.630> sure<00:02:14.080> there<00:02:14.410> was

00:02:14.490 --> 00:02:14.500 
the cheek color it's so sure there was

00:02:14.500 --> 00:02:16.680 
the cheek color it's so sure there was
no<00:02:14.650> pigmentation<00:02:15.520> so<00:02:16.060> now<00:02:16.180> we<00:02:16.240> get<00:02:16.450> to<00:02:16.600> the

00:02:16.680 --> 00:02:16.690 
no pigmentation so now we get to the

00:02:16.690 --> 00:02:18.320 
no pigmentation so now we get to the
rest<00:02:16.870> of<00:02:17.020> the<00:02:17.110> colors<00:02:17.440> in<00:02:17.590> the<00:02:17.680> palette<00:02:17.890> the

00:02:18.320 --> 00:02:18.330 
rest of the colors in the palette the

00:02:18.330 --> 00:02:20.340 
rest of the colors in the palette the
pigmentation<00:02:19.330> and<00:02:19.450> this<00:02:19.600> is<00:02:19.810> severely

00:02:20.340 --> 00:02:20.350 
pigmentation and this is severely

00:02:20.350 --> 00:02:22.650 
pigmentation and this is severely
lacking<00:02:20.709> it<00:02:21.190> swatches<00:02:21.850> beautifully<00:02:22.360> which<00:02:22.510> is

00:02:22.650 --> 00:02:22.660 
lacking it swatches beautifully which is

00:02:22.660 --> 00:02:24.840 
lacking it swatches beautifully which is
the<00:02:22.780> funny<00:02:23.020> thing<00:02:23.380> and<00:02:23.650> which<00:02:24.310> is<00:02:24.490> why<00:02:24.670> I'm<00:02:24.819> not

00:02:24.840 --> 00:02:24.850 
the funny thing and which is why I'm not

00:02:24.850 --> 00:02:28.050 
the funny thing and which is why I'm not
always<00:02:25.120> crazy<00:02:25.569> about<00:02:26.340> swatches<00:02:27.340> in<00:02:27.520> general

00:02:28.050 --> 00:02:28.060 
always crazy about swatches in general

00:02:28.060 --> 00:02:29.670 
always crazy about swatches in general
because<00:02:28.420> the<00:02:28.569> way<00:02:28.690> I<00:02:28.720> wear<00:02:29.080> something<00:02:29.440> on<00:02:29.560> my

00:02:29.670 --> 00:02:29.680 
because the way I wear something on my

00:02:29.680 --> 00:02:32.309 
because the way I wear something on my
arm<00:02:29.920> or<00:02:30.550> the<00:02:30.670> back<00:02:30.850> of<00:02:30.880> my<00:02:31.150> hand<00:02:31.450> is<00:02:31.690> usually

00:02:32.309 --> 00:02:32.319 
arm or the back of my hand is usually

00:02:32.319 --> 00:02:33.720 
arm or the back of my hand is usually
not<00:02:32.620> the<00:02:32.739> way<00:02:32.860> it's<00:02:32.980> going<00:02:33.130> to<00:02:33.190> wear<00:02:33.310> on<00:02:33.550> my

00:02:33.720 --> 00:02:33.730 
not the way it's going to wear on my

00:02:33.730 --> 00:02:36.449 
not the way it's going to wear on my
face<00:02:34.060> so<00:02:34.569> I'm<00:02:34.750> not<00:02:34.900> a<00:02:35.110> swatch<00:02:35.560> hound<00:02:35.890> I<00:02:36.100> do<00:02:36.160> them

00:02:36.449 --> 00:02:36.459 
face so I'm not a swatch hound I do them

00:02:36.459 --> 00:02:37.830 
face so I'm not a swatch hound I do them
for<00:02:36.640> people<00:02:36.790> that<00:02:37.000> I<00:02:37.090> know<00:02:37.150> they<00:02:37.390> want<00:02:37.630> to<00:02:37.720> see

00:02:37.830 --> 00:02:37.840 
for people that I know they want to see

00:02:37.840 --> 00:02:40.559 
for people that I know they want to see
them<00:02:38.050> but<00:02:38.260> oftentimes<00:02:38.860> the<00:02:39.850> swatches<00:02:40.120> can<00:02:40.480> be

00:02:40.559 --> 00:02:40.569 
them but oftentimes the swatches can be

00:02:40.569 --> 00:02:42.300 
them but oftentimes the swatches can be
better<00:02:40.720> than<00:02:40.840> the<00:02:41.080> makeup<00:02:41.470> or<00:02:41.709> the<00:02:41.739> makeup<00:02:42.130> can

00:02:42.300 --> 00:02:42.310 
better than the makeup or the makeup can

00:02:42.310 --> 00:02:44.430 
better than the makeup or the makeup can
be<00:02:42.340> better<00:02:42.550> than<00:02:42.790> the<00:02:42.880> swatches<00:02:43.360> so<00:02:44.140> in<00:02:44.320> this

00:02:44.430 --> 00:02:44.440 
be better than the swatches so in this

00:02:44.440 --> 00:02:50.009 
be better than the swatches so in this
case<00:02:47.040> no<00:02:48.040> pigmentation<00:02:48.970> just<00:02:49.510> it's<00:02:49.660> super

00:02:50.009 --> 00:02:50.019 
case no pigmentation just it's super

00:02:50.019 --> 00:02:52.620 
case no pigmentation just it's super
super<00:02:50.320> super<00:02:50.650> sheer<00:02:50.950> on<00:02:51.190> top<00:02:51.910> of<00:02:52.150> that<00:02:52.390> I've

00:02:52.620 --> 00:02:52.630 
super super sheer on top of that I've

00:02:52.630 --> 00:02:53.910 
super super sheer on top of that I've
tried<00:02:52.930> building<00:02:53.200> them

00:02:53.910 --> 00:02:53.920 
tried building them

00:02:53.920 --> 00:02:56.160 
tried building them
I<00:02:53.950> tried<00:02:54.670> building<00:02:54.820> up<00:02:55.090> the<00:02:55.209> pigmentation<00:02:55.750> and

00:02:56.160 --> 00:02:56.170 
I tried building up the pigmentation and

00:02:56.170 --> 00:02:59.670 
I tried building up the pigmentation and
it's<00:02:56.350> just<00:02:56.650> it's<00:02:57.280> a<00:02:57.400> very<00:02:57.450> greasy<00:02:58.680> creamy

00:02:59.670 --> 00:02:59.680 
it's just it's a very greasy creamy

00:02:59.680 --> 00:03:01.199 
it's just it's a very greasy creamy
texture<00:03:00.220> which<00:03:00.519> at<00:03:00.640> first<00:03:00.850> I<00:03:00.940> thought<00:03:01.120> was

00:03:01.199 --> 00:03:01.209 
texture which at first I thought was

00:03:01.209 --> 00:03:03.750 
texture which at first I thought was
going<00:03:01.360> to<00:03:01.420> be<00:03:01.480> right<00:03:01.660> nice<00:03:01.900> but<00:03:02.739> once<00:03:03.489> you<00:03:03.610> put

00:03:03.750 --> 00:03:03.760 
going to be right nice but once you put

00:03:03.760 --> 00:03:05.190 
going to be right nice but once you put
on<00:03:03.940> your<00:03:04.030> lids<00:03:04.269> increases<00:03:04.870> almost

00:03:05.190 --> 00:03:05.200 
on your lids increases almost

00:03:05.200 --> 00:03:09.479 
on your lids increases almost
immediately<00:03:07.350> it<00:03:08.350> just<00:03:08.620> does<00:03:08.800> not<00:03:08.980> wear<00:03:09.190> long

00:03:09.479 --> 00:03:09.489 
immediately it just does not wear long

00:03:09.489 --> 00:03:12.059 
immediately it just does not wear long
at<00:03:09.910> all<00:03:10.209> and<00:03:10.989> all<00:03:11.110> I've<00:03:11.260> tried<00:03:11.590> this<00:03:11.860> on<00:03:12.040> a

00:03:12.059 --> 00:03:12.069 
at all and all I've tried this on a

00:03:12.069 --> 00:03:13.800 
at all and all I've tried this on a
couple<00:03:12.310> of<00:03:12.550> occasions<00:03:12.850> because<00:03:13.360> I<00:03:13.510> really

00:03:13.800 --> 00:03:13.810 
couple of occasions because I really

00:03:13.810 --> 00:03:15.660 
couple of occasions because I really
wanted<00:03:14.110> to<00:03:14.260> work<00:03:14.440> I<00:03:14.680> can<00:03:14.830> get<00:03:14.920> such<00:03:15.160> a<00:03:15.190> pretty

00:03:15.660 --> 00:03:15.670 
wanted to work I can get such a pretty

00:03:15.670 --> 00:03:18.720 
wanted to work I can get such a pretty
concept<00:03:16.500> and<00:03:17.500> also<00:03:17.980> the<00:03:18.100> other<00:03:18.190> thing<00:03:18.489> when<00:03:18.700> I

00:03:18.720 --> 00:03:18.730 
concept and also the other thing when I

00:03:18.730 --> 00:03:22.710 
concept and also the other thing when I
very<00:03:19.060> first<00:03:19.150> opened<00:03:20.019> this<00:03:20.200> I<00:03:21.450> fixed<00:03:22.450> it<00:03:22.540> I

00:03:22.710 --> 00:03:22.720 
very first opened this I fixed it I

00:03:22.720 --> 00:03:24.030 
very first opened this I fixed it I
glued<00:03:23.049> it<00:03:23.079> back<00:03:23.200> on<00:03:23.530> but<00:03:23.650> when<00:03:23.739> I<00:03:23.829> very<00:03:23.920> first

00:03:24.030 --> 00:03:24.040 
glued it back on but when I very first

00:03:24.040 --> 00:03:26.670 
glued it back on but when I very first
open<00:03:24.549> this<00:03:24.700> this<00:03:25.510> part<00:03:25.870> of<00:03:26.019> my<00:03:26.170> double<00:03:26.470> ended

00:03:26.670 --> 00:03:26.680 
open this this part of my double ended

00:03:26.680 --> 00:03:30.090 
open this this part of my double ended
brush<00:03:26.709> fell<00:03:27.430> off<00:03:27.959> so<00:03:28.959> I<00:03:29.019> had<00:03:29.200> to<00:03:29.290> grab<00:03:29.500> my<00:03:29.530> good

00:03:30.090 --> 00:03:30.100 
brush fell off so I had to grab my good

00:03:30.100 --> 00:03:31.860 
brush fell off so I had to grab my good
old<00:03:30.220> trusty<00:03:30.430> crazy<00:03:30.910> glue<00:03:31.209> and<00:03:31.540> glue<00:03:31.720> it<00:03:31.840> back

00:03:31.860 --> 00:03:31.870 
old trusty crazy glue and glue it back

00:03:31.870 --> 00:03:36.600 
old trusty crazy glue and glue it back
back<00:03:32.350> on<00:03:32.650> so<00:03:33.459> for<00:03:33.820> a<00:03:33.850> palette<00:03:34.299> that<00:03:34.329> costs<00:03:35.610> $39

00:03:36.600 --> 00:03:36.610 
back on so for a palette that costs $39

00:03:36.610 --> 00:03:39.960 
back on so for a palette that costs $39
I<00:03:37.200> could<00:03:38.200> get<00:03:38.380> past<00:03:38.709> it<00:03:39.100> if<00:03:39.310> it<00:03:39.459> were<00:03:39.579> just

00:03:39.960 --> 00:03:39.970 
I could get past it if it were just

00:03:39.970 --> 00:03:41.880 
I could get past it if it were just
sheer<00:03:40.299> pigmentation<00:03:41.170> but<00:03:41.200> I<00:03:41.440> think<00:03:41.620> it's<00:03:41.739> so

00:03:41.880 --> 00:03:41.890 
sheer pigmentation but I think it's so

00:03:41.890 --> 00:03:43.140 
sheer pigmentation but I think it's so
pretty<00:03:41.920> and<00:03:42.280> I<00:03:42.370> think<00:03:42.609> I<00:03:42.670> would<00:03:42.760> have<00:03:42.880> made<00:03:43.030> it

00:03:43.140 --> 00:03:43.150 
pretty and I think I would have made it

00:03:43.150 --> 00:03:45.750 
pretty and I think I would have made it
work<00:03:43.470> but<00:03:44.470> the<00:03:44.620> fact<00:03:44.859> that<00:03:44.980> not<00:03:45.220> only<00:03:45.250> is<00:03:45.609> the

00:03:45.750 --> 00:03:45.760 
work but the fact that not only is the

00:03:45.760 --> 00:03:50.520 
work but the fact that not only is the
color<00:03:45.970> on<00:03:46.359> all<00:03:46.870> these<00:03:47.019> shades<00:03:47.320> so<00:03:47.680> sheer<00:03:49.530> they

00:03:50.520 --> 00:03:50.530 
color on all these shades so sheer they

00:03:50.530 --> 00:03:52.349 
color on all these shades so sheer they
just<00:03:50.769> don't<00:03:50.950> wear<00:03:51.190> along<00:03:51.459> at<00:03:51.760> all<00:03:51.910> I'm<00:03:52.150> talking

00:03:52.349 --> 00:03:52.359 
just don't wear along at all I'm talking

00:03:52.359 --> 00:03:55.800 
just don't wear along at all I'm talking
within<00:03:52.840> an<00:03:53.260> hour<00:03:53.470> to<00:03:53.920> it's<00:03:54.190> like<00:03:54.600> already<00:03:55.600> when

00:03:55.800 --> 00:03:55.810 
within an hour to it's like already when

00:03:55.810 --> 00:03:56.970 
within an hour to it's like already when
you<00:03:55.840> apply<00:03:56.200> it<00:03:56.260> it<00:03:56.440> looks<00:03:56.590> like<00:03:56.709> you<00:03:56.799> don't

00:03:56.970 --> 00:03:56.980 
you apply it it looks like you don't

00:03:56.980 --> 00:03:58.770 
you apply it it looks like you don't
have<00:03:57.070> anything<00:03:57.250> on<00:03:57.670> or<00:03:57.700> barely<00:03:58.090> anything<00:03:58.450> and

00:03:58.770 --> 00:03:58.780 
have anything on or barely anything and

00:03:58.780 --> 00:04:01.170 
have anything on or barely anything and
then<00:03:58.900> it<00:03:58.930> fades<00:03:59.230> so<00:03:59.440> quickly<00:04:00.180> so

00:04:01.170 --> 00:04:01.180 
then it fades so quickly so

00:04:01.180 --> 00:04:04.080 
then it fades so quickly so
unfortunately<00:04:01.959> this<00:04:02.049> is<00:04:02.200> a<00:04:02.230> huge<00:04:02.859> fail<00:04:03.430> for

00:04:04.080 --> 00:04:04.090
