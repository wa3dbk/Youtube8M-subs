00:00:21.640 --> 00:00:26.820 

a<00:00:24.750> little<00:00:25.750> bit<00:00:25.840> of<00:00:25.930> an<00:00:26.020> outside<00:00:26.349> here<00:00:26.500> on<00:00:26.590> Jimmy

00:00:26.820 --> 00:00:26.830 
a little bit of an outside here on Jimmy

00:00:26.830 --> 00:00:29.700 
a little bit of an outside here on Jimmy
the<00:00:26.919> Hat<00:00:27.990> definitely<00:00:28.990> an<00:00:29.050> upset<00:00:29.410> I<00:00:29.439> thought

00:00:29.700 --> 00:00:29.710 
the Hat definitely an upset I thought

00:00:29.710 --> 00:00:31.950 
the Hat definitely an upset I thought
this<00:00:29.829> was<00:00:29.980> a<00:00:30.150> late<00:00:31.150> running<00:00:31.390> sprinter<00:00:31.810> this

00:00:31.950 --> 00:00:31.960 
this was a late running sprinter this

00:00:31.960 --> 00:00:33.540 
this was a late running sprinter this
really<00:00:32.199> I<00:00:32.259> think<00:00:32.470> she<00:00:32.650> wanted<00:00:32.890> to<00:00:33.040> turn<00:00:33.250> so<00:00:33.489> she

00:00:33.540 --> 00:00:33.550 
really I think she wanted to turn so she

00:00:33.550 --> 00:00:35.250 
really I think she wanted to turn so she
got<00:00:33.879> it<00:00:34.030> really<00:00:34.449> really<00:00:34.660> well<00:00:34.809> today

00:00:35.250 --> 00:00:35.260 
got it really really well today

00:00:35.260 --> 00:00:37.350 
got it really really well today
so<00:00:35.379> you<00:00:35.559> shied<00:00:35.800> away<00:00:35.829> at<00:00:36.160> the<00:00:36.280> window<00:00:36.579> I<00:00:36.610> did<00:00:37.149> I

00:00:37.350 --> 00:00:37.360 
so you shied away at the window I did I

00:00:37.360 --> 00:00:39.329 
so you shied away at the window I did I
thought<00:00:37.690> maybe<00:00:37.839> one<00:00:38.140> turn<00:00:38.440> mile<00:00:38.710> at<00:00:38.920> Belmont

00:00:39.329 --> 00:00:39.339 
thought maybe one turn mile at Belmont

00:00:39.339 --> 00:00:40.350 
thought maybe one turn mile at Belmont
or<00:00:39.460> Gulfstream<00:00:39.850> but<00:00:39.970> I<00:00:40.030> don't<00:00:40.150> think<00:00:40.210> she

00:00:40.350 --> 00:00:40.360 
or Gulfstream but I don't think she

00:00:40.360 --> 00:00:41.910 
or Gulfstream but I don't think she
wanted<00:00:40.540> the<00:00:40.660> two<00:00:40.780> terms<00:00:41.050> I<00:00:41.199> was<00:00:41.350> wrong<00:00:41.530> I<00:00:41.710> like

00:01:19.410 --> 00:01:19.420 
might happen cos it never does but it

00:01:19.420 --> 00:01:20.550 
might happen cos it never does but it
looked<00:01:19.600> like<00:01:19.750> there<00:01:19.899> was<00:01:19.990> three<00:01:20.170> or<00:01:20.259> four<00:01:20.289> the

looked like there was three or four the
one<00:01:20.590> in<00:01:20.890> the<00:01:20.979> front<00:01:21.130> and<00:01:21.520> when<00:01:21.940> I<00:01:21.970> saw<00:01:22.210> we<00:01:22.390> had<00:01:22.509> a

00:01:22.529 --> 00:01:22.539 
one in the front and when I saw we had a

00:01:22.539 --> 00:01:24.120 
one in the front and when I saw we had a
lot<00:01:22.690> of<00:01:22.720> pace<00:01:22.990> in<00:01:23.200> front<00:01:23.440> of<00:01:23.500> her<00:01:23.649> I<00:01:23.920> thought

00:01:24.120 --> 00:01:24.130 
lot of pace in front of her I thought

00:01:24.130 --> 00:01:25.679 
lot of pace in front of her I thought
that<00:01:24.399> would<00:01:24.550> really<00:01:24.700> help<00:01:24.910> her<00:01:25.090> today<00:01:25.210> she<00:01:25.570> has

00:01:25.679 --> 00:01:25.689 
that would really help her today she has

00:01:25.689 --> 00:01:29.039 
that would really help her today she has
a<00:01:25.720> short<00:01:26.110> run<00:01:26.290> she<00:01:26.860> wants<00:01:27.130> to<00:01:27.250> close<00:01:27.369> and<00:01:28.210> some

00:01:29.039 --> 00:01:29.049 
a short run she wants to close and some

00:01:29.049 --> 00:01:31.319 
a short run she wants to close and some
of<00:01:29.140> the<00:01:29.200> other<00:01:29.350> races<00:01:29.770> you<00:01:29.979> know<00:01:30.180> it<00:01:31.180> hasn't
