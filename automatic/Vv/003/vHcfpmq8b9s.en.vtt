side<00:01:26.829> of<00:01:26.859> your<00:01:27.070> head<00:01:27.250> so<00:01:27.939> you<00:01:28.030> can<00:01:28.090> still<00:01:28.450> see

00:01:28.649 --> 00:01:28.659 
side of your head so you can still see

00:01:28.659 --> 00:01:30.660 
side of your head so you can still see
what<00:01:28.810> you're<00:01:28.899> doing<00:01:29.170> in<00:01:29.259> a<00:01:29.350> mirror<00:01:29.740> anything

00:01:30.660 --> 00:01:30.670 
what you're doing in a mirror anything

00:01:30.670 --> 00:01:32.969

00:01:32.969 --> 00:01:32.979 
like that and as we're going back we're

00:01:32.979 --> 00:01:34.469 
like that and as we're going back we're
just<00:01:33.009> following<00:01:33.340> kind<00:01:33.850> of<00:01:34.000> the<00:01:34.090> natural

00:01:34.469 --> 00:01:34.479 
just following kind of the natural

00:01:34.479 --> 00:01:35.880 
just following kind of the natural
hairline<00:01:34.719> so<00:01:35.140> we're<00:01:35.259> going<00:01:35.439> at<00:01:35.560> a<00:01:35.590> slight

00:01:35.880 --> 00:01:35.890 
hairline so we're going at a slight

00:01:35.890 --> 00:01:38.490 
hairline so we're going at a slight
downward<00:01:36.219> angle<00:01:36.670> and<00:01:37.149> we're<00:01:38.020> just<00:01:38.200> still

00:01:38.490 --> 00:01:38.500 
downward angle and we're just still

00:01:38.500 --> 00:01:43.800 
downward angle and we're just still

hair well I still have loose ends this
you<00:02:15.010> can<00:02:15.190> braid<00:02:15.400> it<00:02:15.430> all<00:02:15.610> the<00:02:15.700> way<00:02:15.820> down<00:02:15.850> and<00:02:16.150> do

00:02:16.230 --> 00:02:16.240 
you can braid it all the way down and do

00:02:16.240 --> 00:02:17.610 
you can braid it all the way down and do
it<00:02:16.360> but<00:02:16.480> it's<00:02:16.600> harder<00:02:16.870> to<00:02:16.900> pull<00:02:17.170> the<00:02:17.200> hair<00:02:17.470> all

00:02:17.610 --> 00:02:17.620 
it but it's harder to pull the hair all

00:02:17.620 --> 00:02:19.560 
it but it's harder to pull the hair all
the<00:02:17.650> way<00:02:17.860> up<00:02:18.070> at<00:02:18.190> the<00:02:18.220> top<00:02:18.310> then<00:02:18.760> so<00:02:19.390> I'm<00:02:19.450> going

00:02:19.560 --> 00:02:19.570 
the way up at the top then so I'm going

00:02:19.570 --> 00:02:21.540 
the way up at the top then so I'm going
to<00:02:19.600> go<00:02:19.690> back<00:02:19.840> and<00:02:19.990> do<00:02:20.110> it<00:02:20.200> now<00:02:20.350> you<00:02:21.070> can<00:02:21.280> see<00:02:21.310> I'm

00:02:21.540 --> 00:02:21.550 
to go back and do it now you can see I'm

00:02:21.550 --> 00:02:24.170 
to go back and do it now you can see I'm
just<00:02:21.580> grabbing<00:02:22.120> the<00:02:22.210> outside<00:02:22.600> edges<00:02:22.840> and

00:02:24.170 --> 00:02:24.180 
just grabbing the outside edges and

00:02:24.180 --> 00:02:33.060 
just grabbing the outside edges and
pancaking<00:02:25.180> the<00:02:25.630> braids<00:02:31.500> when<00:02:32.500> I<00:02:32.590> get<00:02:32.770> to<00:02:32.920> the

00:02:33.060 --> 00:02:33.070 
pancaking the braids when I get to the

00:02:33.070 --> 00:02:36.990 
pancaking the braids when I get to the
bottom<00:02:34.530> I'm<00:02:35.530> going<00:02:35.709> to<00:02:35.800> still<00:02:36.070> leave<00:02:36.340> probably

00:02:36.990 --> 00:02:37.000 
bottom I'm going to still leave probably

00:02:37.000 --> 00:02:42.230 
bottom I'm going to still leave probably
a<00:02:37.270> good<00:02:37.720> 3/4<00:02:38.620> inches<00:02:38.980> at<00:02:39.130> the<00:02:39.160> end

00:02:42.230 --> 00:02:42.240 

00:02:42.240 --> 00:02:44.240 

and<00:02:42.560> then<00:02:43.560> I'm<00:02:43.650> going<00:02:43.740> to<00:02:43.800> go<00:02:43.890> back<00:02:44.070> into

00:02:44.240 --> 00:02:44.250 
and then I'm going to go back into

00:02:44.250 --> 00:02:51.350 
and then I'm going to go back into
pancake<00:02:44.790> this<00:02:45.000> part<00:02:45.270> too<00:02:45.450> and<00:02:49.670> then<00:02:50.670> you<00:02:51.060> can

00:02:51.350 --> 00:02:51.360 
pancake this part too and then you can

00:02:51.360 --> 00:02:57.940 
pancake this part too and then you can
secure<00:02:51.780> the<00:02:51.960> ends<00:02:52.410> with<00:02:52.470> an<00:02:52.680> elastic

00:02:57.940 --> 00:02:57.950 

00:02:57.950 --> 00:03:00.070 

I<00:02:58.010> still<00:02:58.790> like<00:02:58.940> to<00:02:59.090> leave<00:02:59.270> some<00:02:59.510> ends<00:02:59.720> hanging

00:03:00.070 --> 00:03:00.080 
I still like to leave some ends hanging

00:03:00.080 --> 00:03:02.380 
I still like to leave some ends hanging
out<00:03:00.230> cuz<00:03:00.410> it's<00:03:00.560> just<00:03:00.620> a<00:03:00.830> little<00:03:00.980> more<00:03:01.390> natural

00:03:02.380 --> 00:03:02.390 
out cuz it's just a little more natural

00:03:02.390 --> 00:03:05.259 
out cuz it's just a little more natural
look<00:03:02.629> it's<00:03:02.900> not<00:03:02.989> quite<00:03:03.290> so<00:03:03.319> structured<00:03:04.269> which

00:03:05.259 --> 00:03:05.269 
look it's not quite so structured which

00:03:05.269 --> 00:03:07.000 
look it's not quite so structured which
I<00:03:05.390> think<00:03:05.629> comes<00:03:05.810> off<00:03:06.050> feeling<00:03:06.319> a<00:03:06.530> little<00:03:06.650> more

00:03:07.000 --> 00:03:07.010 
I think comes off feeling a little more

00:03:07.010 --> 00:03:09.699 
I think comes off feeling a little more
boho<00:03:07.610> or<00:03:07.879> also<00:03:08.330> like<00:03:08.690> a<00:03:08.720> Viking<00:03:09.170> warrior<00:03:09.500> would

00:03:09.699 --> 00:03:09.709 
boho or also like a Viking warrior would

00:03:09.709 --> 00:03:14.280 
boho or also like a Viking warrior would
wear<00:03:09.860> it<00:03:10.010> a<00:03:10.190> little<00:03:11.060> more

00:03:14.280 --> 00:03:14.290 

00:03:14.290 --> 00:03:17.630 

with

00:03:17.630 --> 00:03:17.640 

00:03:17.640 --> 00:03:20.360 

can<00:03:18.090> go<00:03:18.300> back<00:03:18.480> and<00:03:18.690> tweak<00:03:18.930> anything<00:03:19.280> that<00:03:20.280> you

00:03:20.360 --> 00:03:20.370 
can go back and tweak anything that you

00:03:20.370 --> 00:03:23.060 
can go back and tweak anything that you
want<00:03:20.810> picture<00:03:21.810> itself<00:03:21.990> pancaked<00:03:22.530> really<00:03:22.920> nice

pops but it adds a lot of dynamic to the

00:06:45.210 --> 00:06:47.120 
pops but it adds a lot of dynamic to the
hairstyle<00:06:45.630> which<00:06:45.780> I<00:06:45.930> love<00:06:46.230> let's<00:06:46.830> do<00:06:47.010> the

00:06:47.120 --> 00:06:47.130 
hairstyle which I love let's do the

00:06:47.130 --> 00:06:51.230 
hairstyle which I love let's do the
final<00:06:47.280> spin<00:06:48.350> so<00:06:49.350> we<00:06:49.470> have<00:06:49.650> this<00:06:49.860> Kapow<00:06:50.430> factor

00:06:51.230 --> 00:06:51.240 
final spin so we have this Kapow factor

00:06:51.240 --> 00:06:54.200 
final spin so we have this Kapow factor
with<00:06:51.810> the<00:06:51.930> braid<00:06:52.200> and<00:06:52.530> then<00:06:53.400> it<00:06:53.700> just<00:06:53.880> becomes

00:06:54.200 --> 00:06:54.210 
with the braid and then it just becomes

00:06:54.210 --> 00:06:56.570 
with the braid and then it just becomes
a<00:06:54.600> normal<00:06:55.260> looking<00:06:55.530> ponytail<00:06:56.100> on<00:06:56.340> the<00:06:56.400> other

00:06:56.570 --> 00:06:56.580 
a normal looking ponytail on the other

00:06:56.580 --> 00:06:59.900
