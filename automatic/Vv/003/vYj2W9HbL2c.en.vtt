that risk about the map and then I told
them<00:01:23.670> our<00:01:23.759> problems<00:01:24.150> and<00:01:24.330> we<00:01:24.390> wait<00:01:24.540> to<00:01:24.720> hear

00:01:29.899 --> 00:01:29.909 
problems are now okay before I get to

00:01:29.909 --> 00:01:38.020 
problems are now okay before I get to
that<00:01:29.939> on<00:01:30.210> this<00:01:30.329> blog

00:01:38.020 --> 00:01:38.030 

00:01:38.030 --> 00:01:41.360 

okay<00:01:39.410> now<00:01:40.410> the<00:01:40.470> number<00:01:40.710> one<00:01:40.740> problem<00:01:41.040> as<00:01:41.250> you

00:01:41.360 --> 00:01:41.370 
okay now the number one problem as you

00:01:41.370 --> 00:01:46.100 
okay now the number one problem as you
can<00:01:41.520> see<00:01:41.730> is<00:01:43.130> the<00:01:44.130> air<00:01:44.370> is<00:01:44.670> coming<00:01:44.910> out<00:01:45.240> of<00:01:45.540> the

00:01:46.100 --> 00:01:46.110 
can see is the air is coming out of the

00:01:46.110 --> 00:01:50.750 
can see is the air is coming out of the
sea<00:01:46.520> right<00:01:47.520> here<00:01:47.900> Phil<00:01:48.900> there's<00:01:49.110> bubbles<00:01:49.760> and

00:01:50.750 --> 00:01:50.760 
sea right here Phil there's bubbles and

00:01:50.760 --> 00:01:52.070 
sea right here Phil there's bubbles and
then<00:01:50.970> it's<00:01:51.060> coming<00:01:51.300> together<00:01:51.390> stitching<00:01:51.990> in

00:01:52.070 --> 00:01:52.080 
then it's coming together stitching in

00:01:52.080 --> 00:01:56.810 
then it's coming together stitching in
the<00:01:52.170> scene<00:01:52.410> there<00:01:53.180> which<00:01:54.180> is<00:01:55.790> right<00:01:56.790> here

00:01:56.810 --> 00:01:56.820 
the scene there which is right here

00:01:56.820 --> 00:02:01.430 
the scene there which is right here
actually<00:01:57.720> hear<00:01:58.050> that<00:01:58.200> noise<00:02:00.110> so<00:02:01.110> it's<00:02:01.200> right

00:02:01.430 --> 00:02:01.440 
actually hear that noise so it's right

00:02:01.440 --> 00:02:03.470 
actually hear that noise so it's right
there<00:02:01.590> to<00:02:01.710> stitch<00:02:01.920> you<00:02:02.070> with<00:02:03.060> made<00:02:03.240> a<00:02:03.270> mark

00:02:03.470 --> 00:02:03.480 
there to stitch you with made a mark

00:02:03.480 --> 00:02:07.070 
there to stitch you with made a mark
there<00:02:03.710> so<00:02:04.710> you<00:02:04.800> can<00:02:04.920> see<00:02:05.130> it<00:02:05.250> now<00:02:05.990> that's<00:02:06.990> the

00:02:07.070 --> 00:02:07.080 
there so you can see it now that's the

00:02:07.080 --> 00:02:09.260 
there so you can see it now that's the
first<00:02:07.320> problem<00:02:07.550> now<00:02:08.550> if<00:02:08.700> that<00:02:08.880> were<00:02:09.000> the<00:02:09.060> only

00:02:09.260 --> 00:02:09.270 
first problem now if that were the only

00:02:09.270 --> 00:02:11.320 
first problem now if that were the only
problem<00:02:09.660> maybe<00:02:09.899> we<00:02:10.140> could<00:02:10.290> fix<00:02:10.470> it

00:02:11.320 --> 00:02:11.330 
problem maybe we could fix it

00:02:11.330 --> 00:02:13.940 
problem maybe we could fix it
unfortunately<00:02:12.330> it<00:02:12.480> isn't<00:02:12.630> there's<00:02:13.260> probably

00:02:13.940 --> 00:02:13.950 
unfortunately it isn't there's probably

00:02:13.950 --> 00:02:16.820 
unfortunately it isn't there's probably
another<00:02:14.190> five<00:02:14.750> but<00:02:15.750> these<00:02:15.930> are<00:02:16.200> in<00:02:16.290> the<00:02:16.740> other

00:02:16.820 --> 00:02:16.830 
another five but these are in the other

00:02:16.830 --> 00:02:22.370 
another five but these are in the other
seems<00:02:18.920> try<00:02:19.920> and<00:02:20.040> push<00:02:20.220> this<00:02:20.400> in<00:02:20.610> here<00:02:21.110> to<00:02:22.110> see

seems try and push this in here to see

00:02:22.380 --> 00:02:25.220 
seems try and push this in here to see
here<00:02:22.790> air<00:02:23.790> is<00:02:23.970> escaping<00:02:24.090> out<00:02:24.690> of<00:02:24.810> this<00:02:24.930> Sam

00:02:25.220 --> 00:02:25.230 
here air is escaping out of this Sam

00:02:25.230 --> 00:02:27.890 
here air is escaping out of this Sam
also<00:02:25.850> puts<00:02:26.850> a<00:02:26.910> simple<00:02:27.240> problem<00:02:27.420> with<00:02:27.630> across

we've noticed so that's one of the
