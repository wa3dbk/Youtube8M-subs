you<00:00:21.869> have<00:00:21.960> to<00:00:22.020> hold<00:00:22.170> it<00:00:22.289> down<00:00:22.529> when<00:00:23.130> you<00:00:23.220> let<00:00:23.369> go

00:00:23.599 --> 00:00:23.609 
you have to hold it down when you let go

00:00:23.609 --> 00:00:26.060 
you have to hold it down when you let go
they<00:00:23.910> shut<00:00:24.180> off<00:00:24.470> so<00:00:25.470> I'm<00:00:25.619> going<00:00:25.800> to<00:00:25.830> show<00:00:26.010> you

they shut off so I'm going to show you
basically<00:00:26.369> how<00:00:27.150> a<00:00:27.689> flashing<00:00:28.580> system<00:00:29.580> works<00:00:29.910> on

00:00:30.290 --> 00:00:30.300 
basically how a flashing system works on

00:00:30.300 --> 00:00:33.889 
basically how a flashing system works on
the<00:00:30.449> motorcycle<00:00:31.700> of<00:00:32.700> course<00:00:33.000> I<00:00:33.300> don't<00:00:33.510> have

00:00:33.889 --> 00:00:33.899 
the motorcycle of course I don't have

00:00:33.899 --> 00:00:36.139 
the motorcycle of course I don't have
any<00:00:34.200> momentary<00:00:34.680> switches<00:00:34.980> with<00:00:35.309> me<00:00:35.550> so<00:00:35.880> I<00:00:35.910> just

00:00:36.139 --> 00:00:36.149 
any momentary switches with me so I just

00:00:36.149 --> 00:00:39.220 
any momentary switches with me so I just
kind<00:00:36.540> of<00:00:36.660> crudely<00:00:37.020> made<00:00:37.860> my<00:00:38.040> own<00:00:38.250> out<00:00:38.489> of<00:00:38.640> wood

00:01:13.789 --> 00:01:13.799 
power comes out once you reach once you

00:01:13.799 --> 00:01:16.219 
power comes out once you reach once you
get<00:01:13.950> some<00:01:14.159> current<00:01:14.850> flow<00:01:15.090> it<00:01:15.659> opens<00:01:16.049> and

00:01:16.219 --> 00:01:16.229 
get some current flow it opens and

00:01:16.229 --> 00:01:19.130 
get some current flow it opens and
closes<00:01:16.409> a<00:01:16.619> switch<00:01:16.950> inside<00:01:17.340> now<00:01:18.119> I've<00:01:18.960> also

00:01:19.130 --> 00:01:19.140 
closes a switch inside now I've also

00:01:19.140 --> 00:01:22.929 
closes a switch inside now I've also
hooked<00:01:19.470> up<00:01:19.650> two<00:01:19.890> little<00:01:20.460> 12-volt<00:01:20.939> lightbulbs

00:01:22.929 --> 00:01:22.939 
hooked up two little 12-volt lightbulbs

00:01:22.939 --> 00:01:25.160 
hooked up two little 12-volt lightbulbs
of<00:01:23.939> course<00:01:24.210> on<00:01:24.360> the<00:01:24.450> motorcycle<00:01:24.930> you're<00:01:25.020> going

00:01:25.160 --> 00:01:25.170 
of course on the motorcycle you're going

00:01:25.170 --> 00:01:26.660 
of course on the motorcycle you're going
to<00:01:25.229> have<00:01:25.320> lightbulbs<00:01:25.710> at<00:01:25.830> the<00:01:25.920> front<00:01:26.159> and<00:01:26.369> at

00:01:26.660 --> 00:01:26.670 
to have lightbulbs at the front and at

00:01:26.670 --> 00:01:28.130 
to have lightbulbs at the front and at
the<00:01:26.700> back<00:01:26.820> so<00:01:27.270> you're<00:01:27.420> going<00:01:27.570> to<00:01:27.630> draw<00:01:27.810> twice

00:01:28.130 --> 00:01:28.140 
the back so you're going to draw twice

00:01:28.140 --> 00:01:30.200 
the back so you're going to draw twice
as<00:01:28.320> much<00:01:28.439> current<00:01:28.860> this<00:01:29.310> flash<00:01:29.610> your<00:01:29.850> unit

00:01:30.200 --> 00:01:30.210 
as much current this flash your unit

00:01:30.210 --> 00:01:32.359 
as much current this flash your unit
will<00:01:30.390> work<00:01:30.630> better<00:01:31.140> when<00:01:31.829> it<00:01:31.979> has<00:01:32.100> higher

00:01:32.359 --> 00:01:32.369 
will work better when it has higher

00:01:32.369 --> 00:01:35.270 
will work better when it has higher
current<00:01:33.150> so<00:01:33.689> right<00:01:34.110> now<00:01:34.290> it<00:01:34.710> will<00:01:35.009> flash<00:01:35.250> a

00:01:35.270 --> 00:01:35.280 
current so right now it will flash a

00:01:35.280 --> 00:01:37.960 
current so right now it will flash a
little<00:01:35.579> slow<00:01:35.939> but<00:01:36.450> it'll<00:01:36.659> still<00:01:36.810> flash<00:01:37.110> and

00:01:37.960 --> 00:01:37.970 
little slow but it'll still flash and

00:01:37.970 --> 00:01:42.710 
little slow but it'll still flash and
I've<00:01:38.970> got<00:01:39.409> various<00:01:40.409> amounts<00:01:40.829> of<00:01:40.950> wire<00:01:41.850> that

00:01:42.710 --> 00:01:42.720 
I've got various amounts of wire that

00:01:42.720 --> 00:01:45.080 
I've got various amounts of wire that
we're<00:01:42.899> going<00:01:43.079> to<00:01:43.259> use<00:01:43.439> rad<00:01:44.399> of<00:01:44.579> course<00:01:44.820> be<00:01:45.000> in

00:01:45.080 --> 00:01:45.090 
we're going to use rad of course be in

00:01:45.090 --> 00:01:48.499 
we're going to use rad of course be in
power<00:01:45.299> black<00:01:46.290> bean<00:01:46.590> ground<00:01:47.009> will<00:01:47.790> use<00:01:48.060> yellow

00:01:48.499 --> 00:01:48.509 
power black bean ground will use yellow

00:01:48.509 --> 00:01:50.270 
power black bean ground will use yellow
and<00:01:48.600> green<00:01:48.899> for<00:01:49.170> the<00:01:49.229> left<00:01:49.470> and<00:01:49.590> right<00:01:49.799> side<00:01:50.040> of

and green for the left and right side of
the<00:01:50.399> lights<00:01:50.579> so<00:01:51.390> first<00:01:52.200> thing<00:01:52.409> we<00:01:52.560> have<00:01:52.740> to<00:01:52.770> do

00:01:53.060 --> 00:01:53.070 
the lights so first thing we have to do

00:01:53.070 --> 00:01:58.190 
the lights so first thing we have to do
is<00:01:54.000> we<00:01:54.210> have<00:01:54.299> to<00:01:54.420> take<00:01:54.600> our<00:01:54.899> positive<00:01:55.350> side<00:01:57.200> we

00:01:58.190 --> 00:01:58.200 
is we have to take our positive side we

00:01:58.200 --> 00:02:00.679 
is we have to take our positive side we
need<00:01:58.409> to<00:01:58.560> go<00:01:58.740> from<00:01:59.070> our<00:01:59.460> positive<00:01:59.850> side<00:02:00.360> of<00:02:00.540> our

00:02:00.679 --> 00:02:00.689 
need to go from our positive side of our

00:02:00.689 --> 00:02:03.649 
need to go from our positive side of our
battery<00:02:01.259> to<00:02:02.070> one<00:02:02.670> side<00:02:02.969> and<00:02:03.299> it<00:02:03.390> doesn't

00:02:03.649 --> 00:02:03.659 
battery to one side and it doesn't

00:02:03.659 --> 00:02:09.949 
battery to one side and it doesn't
matter<00:02:03.810> which<00:02:04.020> one<00:02:04.290> of<00:02:04.469> our<00:02:07.849> flasher<00:02:08.849> unit

00:02:09.949 --> 00:02:09.959 
matter which one of our flasher unit

00:02:09.959 --> 00:02:13.589 
matter which one of our flasher unit
all<00:02:10.959> right<00:02:11.140> then<00:02:12.129> we<00:02:12.370> take<00:02:12.579> the<00:02:12.969> power<00:02:13.180> out<00:02:13.510> of

00:02:13.589 --> 00:02:13.599 
all right then we take the power out of

00:02:13.599 --> 00:02:22.970 
all right then we take the power out of
the<00:02:13.930> flash<00:02:14.170> or<00:02:14.469> unit<00:02:18.329> and<00:02:19.409> we<00:02:20.409> are<00:02:20.590> going<00:02:20.920> to<00:02:21.040> go

00:02:22.970 --> 00:02:22.980 
the flash or unit and we are going to go

00:02:22.980 --> 00:02:28.410 
the flash or unit and we are going to go
to<00:02:23.980> I<00:02:25.980> put<00:02:26.980> a<00:02:27.010> piece<00:02:27.189> of<00:02:27.219> metal<00:02:27.519> tape<00:02:27.879> on<00:02:28.299> the

00:02:28.410 --> 00:02:28.420 
to I put a piece of metal tape on the

00:02:28.420 --> 00:02:30.539 
to I put a piece of metal tape on the
bottom<00:02:28.599> so<00:02:29.439> I'm<00:02:29.530> just<00:02:29.680> going<00:02:29.859> to<00:02:29.980> clamp<00:02:30.219> this

00:02:30.539 --> 00:02:30.549 
bottom so I'm just going to clamp this

00:02:30.549 --> 00:02:33.509 
bottom so I'm just going to clamp this
to<00:02:30.760> one<00:02:31.120> side<00:02:31.450> of<00:02:31.750> that<00:02:31.930> metal<00:02:32.349> tape<00:02:32.650> and<00:02:32.950> that

00:02:33.509 --> 00:02:33.519 
to one side of that metal tape and that

00:02:33.519 --> 00:02:36.330 
to one side of that metal tape and that
will<00:02:33.790> make<00:02:34.060> this<00:02:34.269> whole<00:02:34.510> tape<00:02:34.959> 12<00:02:35.769> volts<00:02:36.189> so

00:02:36.330 --> 00:02:36.340 
will make this whole tape 12 volts so

00:02:36.340 --> 00:02:42.959 
will make this whole tape 12 volts so
that's<00:02:36.549> my<00:02:36.790> 12<00:02:37.540> volt<00:02:38.249> bus<00:02:39.249> line<00:02:40.530> okay<00:02:41.530> so<00:02:41.969> we

00:02:42.959 --> 00:02:42.969 
that's my 12 volt bus line okay so we

00:02:42.969 --> 00:02:45.449 
that's my 12 volt bus line okay so we
have<00:02:43.060> power<00:02:43.299> going<00:02:43.510> through<00:02:44.069> our<00:02:45.069> little

00:02:45.449 --> 00:02:45.459 
have power going through our little

00:02:45.459 --> 00:02:48.179 
have power going through our little
flash<00:02:45.700> our<00:02:45.939> unit<00:02:46.299> and<00:02:47.230> directly<00:02:47.709> into<00:02:48.040> this

00:02:48.179 --> 00:02:48.189

will go through and to the corresponding
light<00:04:08.070> bulb<00:04:08.340> now<00:04:08.910> we<00:04:09.450> need<00:04:09.630> a<00:04:09.660> ground<00:04:09.990> path

00:04:10.550 --> 00:04:10.560 
light bulb now we need a ground path

00:04:10.560 --> 00:04:13.040 
light bulb now we need a ground path
from<00:04:11.400> the<00:04:11.610> light<00:04:11.760> bulbs<00:04:12.210> so<00:04:12.420> I'm<00:04:12.750> just<00:04:12.930> going

00:04:13.040 --> 00:04:13.050 
from the light bulbs so I'm just going

00:04:13.050 --> 00:04:25.500 
from the light bulbs so I'm just going
to<00:04:13.140> hook<00:04:13.260> both<00:04:13.590> light<00:04:13.860> bulbs<00:04:14.250> to<00:04:14.460> ground

00:04:25.500 --> 00:04:25.510 

00:04:25.510 --> 00:04:29.010 

and<00:04:25.960> I<00:04:26.110> will<00:04:26.290> plug<00:04:26.500> it<00:04:26.620> in<00:04:26.800> the<00:04:27.160> ground<00:04:27.720> of<00:04:28.720> the
