00:00:00.739 --> 00:00:03.739
 no 

00:00:09.149 --> 00:00:14.449
 hello many workshops for a fun and interesting experience 

00:00:14.449 --> 00:00:15.620
 today 

00:00:15.620 --> 00:00:17.660
 we worked on the subject 

00:00:17.660 --> 00:00:23.390
 we worked on the president's visit by studying after three years 

00:00:23.390 --> 00:00:25.240
 a wind instrument 

00:00:25.240 --> 00:00:26.570
 like this one 

00:00:26.570 --> 00:00:27.880
 and the Americans 

00:00:27.880 --> 00:00:29.900
 how does a media work 

00:00:29.900 --> 00:00:31.519
 what are the main ones 

00:00:31.519 --> 00:00:33.149
 and U.S. too 

00:00:33.149 --> 00:00:37.179
 we will also be able to finally high school in France 

00:00:42.920 --> 00:00:47.960
 a harmonica player in the second with him we're going to spend 

00:00:47.960 --> 00:00:49.600
 at first gestures 

00:00:49.600 --> 00:00:50.789
 first test 

00:00:50.789 --> 00:00:54.569
 with this harmonica player whose reputation is second to none 

00:00:54.569 --> 00:00:59.420
 let's see how this little piece of metal she is one of the instruments he 

00:00:59.420 --> 00:01:00.400
 is more popular 

00:01:00.400 --> 00:01:01.830
 worldwide 

00:01:01.830 --> 00:01:03.610
 so tell me 

00:01:03.610 --> 00:01:07.270
 claude babyar of the world's first harmonica player I searched 

00:01:07.270 --> 00:01:09.660
 the phases the rainy season 

00:01:09.660 --> 00:01:13.430
 do not imagine that the founder of facebook is a good 

00:01:13.430 --> 00:01:13.990
 idea 

00:01:13.990 --> 00:01:16.350
 others by this tuesday 

00:01:16.350 --> 00:01:18.560
 there must be an individual error 

00:01:18.560 --> 00:01:21.450
 the strings are big 

00:01:21.450 --> 00:01:23.230
 if everyone 

00:01:23.230 --> 00:01:26.270
 it is not yet this first experience at that time 

00:01:27.820 --> 00:01:31.280
 However, if this is done at the expense of Switzerland in the work of the G8 

00:01:32.530 --> 00:01:35.530
 but I do not think he's beefier than things 

00:01:37.670 --> 00:01:39.460
 we will see the purchase 

00:01:39.460 --> 00:01:41.210
 with afp 

00:01:41.210 --> 00:01:44.210
 no 

00:01:46.570 --> 00:01:50.760
 for example we had a little problem of understanding with the cats he 

00:01:50.760 --> 00:01:54.270
 just been replaced for this experience we're going all the 

00:01:54.270 --> 00:01:55.200
 currents 

00:01:55.200 --> 00:02:00.010
 then this harmony that could pounce in which she 

00:02:00.010 --> 00:02:04.210
 what and why will you tell me well it's very simple to believe the voice 

00:02:04.210 --> 00:02:08.290
 the best sound possible when the young age of the harmonica 

00:02:08.290 --> 00:02:12.660
 we are now going to the media directly inside the jura 

00:02:14.029 --> 00:02:15.049
 while mixing 

00:02:15.049 --> 00:02:16.479
 US 

00:02:16.479 --> 00:02:19.479
 as for food cats 

00:02:21.019 --> 00:02:23.559
 It's as simple as that 

00:02:23.559 --> 00:02:24.520
 here 

00:02:24.520 --> 00:02:28.760
 in addition to choosing a gang and its harmonica you have plenty of time 

00:02:28.760 --> 00:02:31.760
 to go clean his box because it will not be done alone 

00:02:33.439 --> 00:02:37.340
 now that the judge also said he was right about him 

00:02:37.340 --> 00:02:40.340
 he first offered a nice demonstration 

00:02:50.549 --> 00:02:53.970
 after this demonstration what should we conclude 

00:02:53.970 --> 00:02:55.089
 day or two 

00:02:55.089 --> 00:02:59.499
 the debates and range of notes of the harmonica spans two hostages 

00:03:00.109 --> 00:03:03.200
 on the other hand sharks do not have their true face 

00:03:09.019 --> 00:03:12.019
 and if you fill in the 

00:03:14.709 --> 00:03:17.269
 its goal 

00:03:17.269 --> 00:03:20.269
 mua 

00:03:24.949 --> 00:03:26.529
 mid
