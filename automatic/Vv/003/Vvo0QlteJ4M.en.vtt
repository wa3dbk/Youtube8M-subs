00:01:26.330 --> 00:01:28.540 
stopping every time so let's do the legs
changing<00:01:27.080> directions<00:01:27.350> every<00:01:27.710> time<00:01:28.160> movie

00:01:28.540 --> 00:01:28.550 
changing directions every time movie

00:01:28.550 --> 00:01:36.310 
changing directions every time movie
might<00:01:28.700> hit<00:01:28.910> escape<00:01:29.119> all<00:01:29.810> right<00:01:29.990> here<00:01:30.140> it<00:01:30.229> goes

00:01:36.310 --> 00:01:36.320 

00:01:36.320 --> 00:01:38.740 

all<00:01:37.100> right<00:01:37.280> that's<00:01:37.970> the<00:01:38.090> second<00:01:38.479> variation

00:01:38.740 --> 00:01:38.750 
all right that's the second variation

00:01:38.750 --> 00:01:40.930 
all right that's the second variation
now<00:01:39.080> the<00:01:39.140> third<00:01:39.409> variation<00:01:39.740> is<00:01:40.310> behind<00:01:40.760> the
