feel they're ready to throw it out

00:00:36.920 --> 00:00:39.860 
feel they're ready to throw it out
there's<00:00:37.920> a<00:00:38.010> way<00:00:38.100> to<00:00:38.220> kind<00:00:38.910> of<00:00:39.059> revitalize<00:00:39.360> it

00:00:39.860 --> 00:00:39.870 
there's a way to kind of revitalize it

00:00:39.870 --> 00:00:41.240 
there's a way to kind of revitalize it
so<00:00:40.110> that<00:00:40.260> you<00:00:40.350> don't<00:00:40.590> have<00:00:40.710> to<00:00:40.860> throw<00:00:41.010> it<00:00:41.100> out

00:00:41.240 --> 00:00:41.250 
so that you don't have to throw it out

00:00:41.250 --> 00:00:43.850 
so that you don't have to throw it out
so<00:00:41.820> soon<00:00:42.090> you<00:00:42.690> can<00:00:42.840> keep<00:00:42.989> using<00:00:43.199> it<00:00:43.470> I<00:00:43.620> have<00:00:43.739> to

00:00:43.850 --> 00:00:43.860 
so soon you can keep using it I have to

00:00:43.860 --> 00:00:45.770 
so soon you can keep using it I have to
do<00:00:43.980> is<00:00:44.160> put<00:00:44.370> some<00:00:44.519> stainless<00:00:45.030> steel<00:00:45.330> in<00:00:45.510> it<00:00:45.600> and

00:00:45.770 --> 00:00:45.780 
do is put some stainless steel in it and

00:00:45.780 --> 00:00:48.470 
do is put some stainless steel in it and
the<00:00:46.350> copper<00:00:46.739> will<00:00:46.890> cement<00:00:47.400> to<00:00:47.760> it<00:00:47.970> and<00:00:48.210> then

00:00:48.470 --> 00:00:48.480 
the copper will cement to it and then

00:00:48.480 --> 00:00:50.479 
the copper will cement to it and then
you<00:00:49.260> leave<00:00:49.440> it<00:00:49.559> in<00:00:49.650> overnight<00:00:49.739> or<00:00:50.250> for<00:00:50.280> a

00:00:50.479 --> 00:00:50.489 
you leave it in overnight or for a

00:00:50.489 --> 00:00:52.009 
you leave it in overnight or for a
couple<00:00:50.519> days<00:00:50.850> however<00:00:51.299> long<00:00:51.540> it<00:00:51.659> takes<00:00:51.690> for

00:00:52.009 --> 00:00:52.019 
couple days however long it takes for

00:00:52.019 --> 00:00:55.100 
couple days however long it takes for
your<00:00:52.170> solution<00:00:52.530> to<00:00:52.620> start<00:00:52.860> clearing<00:00:53.250> up<00:00:54.110> yeah

00:00:55.100 --> 00:00:55.110 
your solution to start clearing up yeah

00:00:55.110 --> 00:00:57.049 
your solution to start clearing up yeah
so<00:00:55.140> you<00:00:55.379> just<00:00:55.620> put<00:00:56.339> the<00:00:56.430> stainless<00:00:56.640> steel<00:00:56.790> in

00:00:57.049 --> 00:00:57.059 
so you just put the stainless steel in

00:00:57.059 --> 00:01:00.380 
so you just put the stainless steel in
there<00:00:57.180> and<00:00:57.420> I'll<00:00:58.350> show<00:00:58.530> you<00:00:59.030> basically<00:01:00.030> what

00:01:00.380 --> 00:01:00.390 
there and I'll show you basically what

00:01:00.390 --> 00:01:06.380 
there and I'll show you basically what
it<00:01:01.049> does<00:01:03.199> this<00:01:04.199> is<00:01:04.409> a<00:01:04.440> spoon<00:01:04.830> that<00:01:05.729> I<00:01:05.760> had<00:01:06.090> put

00:01:06.380 --> 00:01:06.390 
it does this is a spoon that I had put

00:01:06.390 --> 00:01:08.750 
it does this is a spoon that I had put
in<00:01:06.479> there<00:01:06.690> and<00:01:06.960> I<00:01:06.990> just<00:01:07.710> started<00:01:08.220> scraping<00:01:08.610> off

00:01:08.750 --> 00:01:08.760 
in there and I just started scraping off

00:01:08.760 --> 00:01:11.359 
in there and I just started scraping off
some<00:01:08.790> of<00:01:09.030> the<00:01:09.119> copper<00:01:09.510> that's<00:01:09.860> deposited<00:01:10.860> on

00:01:11.359 --> 00:01:11.369 
some of the copper that's deposited on

00:01:11.369 --> 00:01:16.570 
some of the copper that's deposited on
it<00:01:11.690> so<00:01:13.580> take<00:01:14.580> a<00:01:14.610> look<00:01:14.760> down<00:01:14.940> here<00:01:15.000> alright<00:01:15.990> so

00:01:16.570 --> 00:01:16.580 
it so take a look down here alright so

00:01:16.580 --> 00:01:22.730 
it so take a look down here alright so
what<00:01:17.580> I've<00:01:17.700> got<00:01:17.729> here<00:01:17.939> is<00:01:20.150> beaker<00:01:21.150> with<00:01:21.740> some

00:01:22.730 --> 00:01:22.740 
what I've got here is beaker with some

00:01:22.740 --> 00:01:24.830 
what I've got here is beaker with some
used<00:01:23.190> AP<00:01:23.640> that<00:01:23.850> I've<00:01:23.970> been<00:01:24.060> messing<00:01:24.780> around

00:01:24.830 --> 00:01:24.840 
used AP that I've been messing around

00:01:24.840 --> 00:01:30.770 
used AP that I've been messing around
with<00:01:26.600> and<00:01:27.800> I<00:01:28.800> put<00:01:29.580> two<00:01:30.060> of<00:01:30.180> these<00:01:30.270> spoons<00:01:30.540> in

00:01:30.770 --> 00:01:30.780 
with and I put two of these spoons in

00:01:30.780 --> 00:01:32.450 
with and I put two of these spoons in
there<00:01:30.900> kind<00:01:31.140> of<00:01:31.230> drops<00:01:31.530> when<00:01:31.770> I<00:01:31.860> copper<00:01:32.250> and

00:01:32.450 --> 00:01:32.460 
there kind of drops when I copper and

00:01:32.460 --> 00:01:36.560 
there kind of drops when I copper and
this<00:01:33.270> has<00:01:33.390> been<00:01:33.570> here<00:01:33.840> for<00:01:33.990> two<00:01:34.320> hours<00:01:35.360> so<00:01:36.360> pull

00:01:36.560 --> 00:01:36.570 
this has been here for two hours so pull

00:01:36.570 --> 00:01:39.770 
this has been here for two hours so pull
it<00:01:36.600> up<00:01:36.780> carefully<00:01:37.290> you<00:01:37.410> don't<00:01:37.590> want<00:01:37.770> to<00:01:38.780> you

00:01:39.770 --> 00:01:39.780 
it up carefully you don't want to you

00:01:39.780 --> 00:01:41.930 
it up carefully you don't want to you
don't<00:01:39.810> want<00:01:40.020> the<00:01:41.010> doll<00:01:41.160> to<00:01:41.310> fall<00:01:41.490> back<00:01:41.700> in<00:01:41.880> the

00:01:41.930 --> 00:01:41.940 
don't want the doll to fall back in the

00:01:41.940 --> 00:01:44.540 
don't want the doll to fall back in the
solution<00:01:42.330> but<00:01:42.450> that's<00:01:43.140> that's<00:01:43.980> all<00:01:44.160> copper

00:01:44.540 --> 00:01:44.550 
solution but that's that's all copper

00:01:44.550 --> 00:01:46.310 
solution but that's that's all copper
right<00:01:44.670> there<00:01:44.850> that's<00:01:45.000> all<00:01:45.180> copper<00:01:46.170> that's

00:01:46.310 --> 00:01:46.320 
right there that's all copper that's

00:01:46.320 --> 00:01:48.980 
right there that's all copper that's
stuck<00:01:46.650> right<00:01:46.860> to<00:01:46.950> that<00:01:47.070> spoon<00:01:47.480> so<00:01:48.480> what<00:01:48.900> you

00:01:48.980 --> 00:01:48.990 
stuck right to that spoon so what you

00:01:48.990 --> 00:01:52.700 
stuck right to that spoon so what you
can<00:01:49.140> do<00:01:49.320> is<00:01:49.650> just<00:01:50.340> take<00:01:51.270> anything<00:01:51.780> to<00:01:51.990> kind<00:01:52.620> of

00:01:52.700 --> 00:01:52.710 
can do is just take anything to kind of

00:01:52.710 --> 00:02:09.010 
can do is just take anything to kind of
scrape<00:01:53.100> it<00:01:53.250> off<00:01:53.370> the<00:01:53.520> spoon

00:02:09.010 --> 00:02:09.020 

00:02:09.020 --> 00:02:11.540 

all<00:02:10.020> right<00:02:10.110> so<00:02:10.289> that<00:02:10.410> spoon<00:02:10.950> is<00:02:11.099> pretty<00:02:11.340> clean

00:02:11.540 --> 00:02:11.550 
all right so that spoon is pretty clean

00:02:11.550 --> 00:02:34.640 
all right so that spoon is pretty clean
so<00:02:11.760> I'm<00:02:11.819> gonna<00:02:11.940> stick<00:02:12.150> it<00:02:12.209> back<00:02:12.360> in

00:02:34.640 --> 00:02:34.650 

00:02:34.650 --> 00:02:38.369 

all<00:02:35.650> right<00:02:35.800> so<00:02:36.069> what<00:02:36.220> you're<00:02:36.340> left<00:02:36.550> here<00:02:37.379> is

00:02:38.369 --> 00:02:38.379 
all right so what you're left here is

00:02:38.379 --> 00:02:41.070 
all right so what you're left here is
you've<00:02:38.680> got<00:02:38.890> basically<00:02:39.069> I<00:02:39.700> believe<00:02:40.450> the<00:02:40.810> pure

00:02:41.070 --> 00:02:41.080 
you've got basically I believe the pure

00:02:41.080 --> 00:02:45.690 
you've got basically I believe the pure
copper<00:02:41.349> so<00:02:42.340> if<00:02:42.519> you<00:02:42.610> let<00:02:42.760> this<00:02:42.879> dry<00:02:43.239> out<00:02:44.700> you

00:02:45.690 --> 00:02:45.700 
copper so if you let this dry out you

00:02:45.700 --> 00:02:49.220 
copper so if you let this dry out you
can<00:02:46.440> know<00:02:47.440> if<00:02:47.650> your<00:02:47.799> yard<00:02:48.069> will<00:02:48.220> take<00:02:48.459> it<00:02:48.670> but

00:02:49.220 --> 00:02:49.230 
can know if your yard will take it but

00:02:49.230 --> 00:02:54.030 
can know if your yard will take it but
you<00:02:50.230> know<00:02:50.349> that's<00:02:50.910> pure<00:02:51.910> copper<00:02:52.680> all<00:02:53.680> right<00:02:53.860> so

00:02:54.030 --> 00:02:54.040 
you know that's pure copper all right so

00:02:54.040 --> 00:02:55.020 
you know that's pure copper all right so
that's<00:02:54.129> how<00:02:54.310> you<00:02:54.370> bring<00:02:54.610> a<00:02:54.700> little<00:02:54.879> bit<00:02:54.970> of

00:02:55.020 --> 00:02:55.030 
that's how you bring a little bit of

00:02:55.030 --> 00:02:57.539 
that's how you bring a little bit of
life<00:02:55.150> back<00:02:55.390> to<00:02:55.599> your<00:02:55.720> acid<00:02:55.989> peroxide<00:02:56.470> or<00:02:57.430> in

00:02:57.539 --> 00:02:57.549 
life back to your acid peroxide or in

00:02:57.549 --> 00:02:59.789 
life back to your acid peroxide or in
this<00:02:57.640> case<00:02:57.819> it's<00:02:58.090> copper<00:02:58.599> chloride<00:02:58.959> copper<00:02:59.560> to

00:02:59.789 --> 00:02:59.799 
this case it's copper chloride copper to

00:02:59.799 --> 00:03:04.860 
this case it's copper chloride copper to
chloride<00:03:00.329> I'm<00:03:01.329> not<00:03:01.510> a<00:03:01.540> chemist<00:03:02.790> but<00:03:03.790> you<00:03:04.660> just

00:03:04.860 --> 00:03:04.870 
chloride I'm not a chemist but you just

00:03:04.870 --> 00:03:06.479 
chloride I'm not a chemist but you just
put<00:03:05.290> some<00:03:05.410> stainless<00:03:05.799> steel<00:03:06.010> in<00:03:06.160> there<00:03:06.310> and<00:03:06.430> it

00:03:06.479 --> 00:03:06.489 
put some stainless steel in there and it

00:03:06.489 --> 00:03:12.569 
put some stainless steel in there and it

00:03:17.789 --> 00:03:17.799 
questions comments hate me see on that

00:03:17.799 --> 00:03:22.500 
questions comments hate me see on that
next<00:03:17.920> one<00:03:19.530> if<00:03:20.530> you<00:03:20.620> guys<00:03:20.739> can<00:03:20.980> see<00:03:21.340> that<00:03:21.610> those

00:03:22.500 --> 00:03:22.510 
next one if you guys can see that those

00:03:22.510 --> 00:03:25.819 
next one if you guys can see that those
are<00:03:22.540> all<00:03:23.370> copper<00:03:24.370> crystals<00:03:24.910> that<00:03:25.060> are<00:03:25.180> forming

00:03:25.819 --> 00:03:25.829 
are all copper crystals that are forming

00:03:25.829 --> 00:03:42.280 
are all copper crystals that are forming
on<00:03:26.829> the<00:03:27.989> on<00:03:28.989> the<00:03:29.140> spoon<00:03:31.049> pretty<00:03:32.049> cool

00:03:42.280 --> 00:03:42.290 

00:03:42.290 --> 00:03:44.740 

now<00:03:42.860> they're<00:03:43.099> all<00:03:43.250> very<00:03:43.819> very<00:03:44.060> loose<00:03:44.330> on<00:03:44.540> their

00:03:44.740 --> 00:03:44.750 
now they're all very very loose on their

00:03:44.750 --> 00:03:47.130 
now they're all very very loose on their
so<00:03:44.930> careful<00:03:45.260> when<00:03:45.349> you<00:03:45.409> pull<00:03:45.560> the<00:03:45.620> spoons<00:03:45.920> out

00:03:47.130 --> 00:03:47.140 
so careful when you pull the spoons out

00:03:47.140 --> 00:03:50.500 
so careful when you pull the spoons out
so<00:03:48.140> that<00:03:48.319> you<00:03:48.560> don't<00:03:48.790> drop<00:03:49.790> all<00:03:49.970> that<00:03:50.120> copper

00:03:50.500 --> 00:03:50.510 
so that you don't drop all that copper

00:03:50.510 --> 00:03:52.839 
so that you don't drop all that copper
back<00:03:51.079> into<00:03:51.379> the<00:03:51.470> solution<00:03:51.709> no<00:03:52.370> big<00:03:52.519> deal<00:03:52.700> and

00:03:52.839 --> 00:03:52.849 
back into the solution no big deal and

00:03:52.849 --> 00:03:54.910 
back into the solution no big deal and
it'll<00:03:53.000> sink<00:03:53.239> right<00:03:53.360> to<00:03:53.420> the<00:03:53.540> bottom<00:03:53.599> and<00:03:54.049> you

00:03:54.910 --> 00:03:54.920 
it'll sink right to the bottom and you

00:03:54.920 --> 00:03:59.890 
it'll sink right to the bottom and you
just<00:03:54.980> slowly<00:03:55.579> decant<00:03:56.090> the<00:03:56.269> fluid<00:03:56.629> off<00:03:56.780> and<00:03:58.900> the

00:03:59.890 --> 00:03:59.900 
just slowly decant the fluid off and the

00:03:59.900 --> 00:04:02.559 
just slowly decant the fluid off and the
copper<00:04:00.200> should<00:04:00.349> stay<00:04:00.530> at<00:04:00.590> the<00:04:00.650> bottom<00:04:00.829> oh<00:04:01.569> and

00:04:02.559 --> 00:04:02.569 
copper should stay at the bottom oh and

00:04:02.569 --> 00:04:04.270 
copper should stay at the bottom oh and
also<00:04:02.750> this<00:04:03.349> should<00:04:03.590> go<00:04:03.709> without<00:04:03.890> saying<00:04:03.950> but

00:04:04.270 --> 00:04:04.280 
also this should go without saying but

00:04:04.280 --> 00:04:05.140 
also this should go without saying but
I'll<00:04:04.459> say<00:04:04.610> it<00:04:04.640> anyway

00:04:05.140 --> 00:04:05.150 
I'll say it anyway

00:04:05.150 --> 00:04:11.559 
I'll say it anyway
do<00:04:06.019> not<00:04:06.340> ever<00:04:07.340> reuse<00:04:08.329> these<00:04:09.370> utensils<00:04:10.569> don't

00:04:11.559 --> 00:04:11.569 
do not ever reuse these utensils don't

00:04:11.569 --> 00:04:14.080 
do not ever reuse these utensils don't
think<00:04:12.379> that<00:04:12.500> you<00:04:12.590> can<00:04:12.709> clean<00:04:12.950> it<00:04:13.099> and<00:04:13.280> go<00:04:14.060> back

00:04:14.080 --> 00:04:14.090 
think that you can clean it and go back

00:04:14.090 --> 00:04:19.680 
think that you can clean it and go back
in<00:04:14.420> the<00:04:14.480> kitchen<00:04:14.780> drawer<00:04:15.530> just<00:04:16.180> not<00:04:17.180> good<00:04:17.419> a
