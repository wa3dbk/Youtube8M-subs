00:00:00.450 --> 00:00:04.560
 hey people here and in the video 

00:00:02.879 --> 00:00:06.809
 I tell you something about the spectrum 

00:00:04.560 --> 00:00:08.309
 Camouflage Some think that there is 

00:00:06.809 --> 00:00:10.440
 a hacker camouflage in call of duty 

00:00:08.309 --> 00:00:13.080
 ghost and that is related to that 

00:00:10.440 --> 00:00:14.820
 All hackers have a rainbow zebra 

00:00:13.080 --> 00:00:16.260
 have a clue but that is only because 

00:00:14.820 --> 00:00:18.630
 that the hacker all payments 

00:00:16.260 --> 00:00:20.040
 have unlocked and therefore easy 

00:00:18.630 --> 00:00:21.840
 choose this camouflage 

00:00:20.040 --> 00:00:23.130
 but that is really a camouflage 

00:00:21.840 --> 00:00:24.570
 is not hacked but you can 

00:00:23.130 --> 00:00:26.970
 really get it right 

00:00:24.570 --> 00:00:29.400
 which one can really get loved only 

00:00:26.970 --> 00:00:31.290
 we did not know how many until now 

00:00:29.400 --> 00:00:35.250
 meant you have to camp three 

00:00:31.290 --> 00:00:37.830
 games trade so a 25 years in the 

00:00:35.250 --> 00:00:39.990
 play mode search and rescue do that 

00:00:37.830 --> 00:00:41.610
 but then made some and you 

00:00:39.990 --> 00:00:43.950
 quickly figured out that 

00:00:41.610 --> 00:00:45.690
 not true and that the camouflage so 

00:00:43.950 --> 00:00:47.730
 does not get and now you have stop 

00:00:45.690 --> 00:00:48.720
 long worked and now it is finally 

00:00:47.730 --> 00:00:51.210
 come out 

00:00:48.720 --> 00:00:52.920
 that's just a micro this is 

00:00:51.210 --> 00:00:55.590
 namely not just a camouflage but 

00:00:52.920 --> 00:00:57.300
 also a title and as his own 

00:00:55.590 --> 00:00:59.489
 red dot it here and there everything looks good 

00:00:57.300 --> 00:01:01.470
 and it is definitely confirmed 

00:00:59.489 --> 00:01:03.000
 that there is really a camouflage there 

00:01:01.470 --> 00:01:05.069
 then there are red dots cia there is one 

00:01:03.000 --> 00:01:07.259
 player picture there is a title so 

00:01:05.069 --> 00:01:09.210
 that in any case, such a dlc and me 

00:01:07.259 --> 00:01:11.549
 I 'm sure that 's the first design 

00:01:09.210 --> 00:01:13.109
 will that also cost what will that be 

00:01:11.549 --> 00:01:15.270
 christmas beer she was free 

00:01:13.109 --> 00:01:17.310
 and who else has this camouflage 

00:01:15.270 --> 00:01:18.929
 except the hackers, well, the gamestop 

00:01:17.310 --> 00:01:20.549
 Employees in america in any case 

00:01:18.929 --> 00:01:21.959
 I do not know how this works in here 

00:01:20.549 --> 00:01:23.850
 Austria and Germany 

00:01:21.959 --> 00:01:25.999
 I would say who to meet 

00:01:23.850 --> 00:01:28.469
 the one at a gamestop or one 

00:01:25.999 --> 00:01:30.149
 somehow any other shops 

00:01:28.469 --> 00:01:32.100
 who could have stopped working 

00:01:30.149 --> 00:01:34.380
 Maybe if to do but think so 

00:01:32.100 --> 00:01:35.850
 less I say gamestop than this one 

00:01:34.380 --> 00:01:37.950
 people in america like in any case 

00:01:35.850 --> 00:01:39.420
 said the camouflage already have the 

00:01:37.950 --> 00:01:41.459
 have the coachmen and they can 

00:01:39.420 --> 00:01:43.049
 already read and can be longer 

00:01:41.459 --> 00:01:44.819
 time to play and the hackers the 

00:01:43.049 --> 00:01:46.259
 that's also why you see that 

00:01:44.819 --> 00:01:47.639
 also often in multiplayer lobbies and 

00:01:46.259 --> 00:01:49.049
 as I said I have the livestream 

00:01:47.639 --> 00:01:50.959
 lifted and I'm right 

00:01:49.049 --> 00:01:53.399
 freaked out because I suddenly ein 

00:01:50.959 --> 00:01:55.529
 zebra rainbow camouflage and the 

00:01:53.399 --> 00:01:57.179
 falls really really cool, I, I will 

00:01:55.529 --> 00:01:58.679
 Now, of course, some pictures show 

00:01:57.179 --> 00:02:00.149
 from the whole and you can see me in 

00:01:58.679 --> 00:02:01.979
 the comments write what he does to that 

00:02:00.149 --> 00:02:04.049
 all say I want to necessarily 

00:02:01.979 --> 00:02:06.299
 Do you know if you've been online before 

00:02:04.049 --> 00:02:07.770
 We have not seen any yet 

00:02:06.299 --> 00:02:09.329
 releasedatum do not even know that 

00:02:07.770 --> 00:02:11.400
 the people at gamestop then I go 

00:02:09.329 --> 00:02:13.500
 otherwise there would be any 

00:02:11.400 --> 00:02:14.069
 Information as with the turquoise the 

00:02:13.500 --> 00:02:15.329

00:02:14.069 --> 00:02:17.430

00:02:15.329 --> 00:02:18.989
 be in front of it in any case 

00:02:17.430 --> 00:02:20.400
 we do not get anything but everyone 

00:02:18.989 --> 00:02:22.469
 case cool that we know that 

00:02:20.400 --> 00:02:23.730
 not the hacker camouflage is but 

00:02:22.469 --> 00:02:26.099
 really a camouflage we then 

00:02:23.730 --> 00:02:27.540
 sometime can all get so 

00:02:26.099 --> 00:02:29.069

00:02:30.689 --> 00:02:34.409
 winter holidays will be even more 

00:02:32.670 --> 00:02:35.370
 other projects on a canal 

00:02:34.409 --> 00:02:36.689
 to be started 

00:02:35.370 --> 00:02:39.209
 I'm really looking forward to it, though 

00:02:36.689 --> 00:02:40.079
 now comes the final spurt 

00:02:39.209 --> 00:02:42.239
 Now I'm at school 

00:02:40.079 --> 00:02:43.739
 really going on but there is one 

00:02:42.239 --> 00:02:45.060
 comments maybe the days but still 

00:02:43.739 --> 00:02:45.569
 we have another week here in 

00:02:45.060 --> 00:02:47.549
 Vienna 

00:02:45.569 --> 00:02:49.349
 and then we already have holidays and 

00:02:47.549 --> 00:02:51.120
 I think everywhere that is so out of the way 

00:02:49.349 --> 00:02:53.159
 you might already be now 

00:02:51.120 --> 00:02:54.299

00:02:53.159 --> 00:02:56.010
 the next week school is on 

00:02:54.299 --> 00:02:58.500
 Christmas is but that's me

00:03:03.299 --> 00:03:07.109
 Christmas is just but 

00:03:05.189 --> 00:03:08.579
 cute and cold and rainy 

00:03:07.109 --> 00:03:09.900

00:03:08.579 --> 00:03:11.639
 Write like the weather here with you 

00:03:09.900 --> 00:03:13.139
 That's really true in Germany 

00:03:11.639 --> 00:03:15.180

00:03:13.139 --> 00:03:16.769

00:03:16.769 --> 00:03:20.519
