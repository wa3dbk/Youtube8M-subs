00:01:39.630 --> 00:01:42.109 
what's actually the scene so our color
balance<00:01:39.960> just<00:01:40.140> jumps<00:01:40.770> right<00:01:40.860> where<00:01:41.460> it<00:01:42.060> needs

00:01:42.109 --> 00:01:42.119 
balance just jumps right where it needs

00:01:42.119 --> 00:01:44.600 
balance just jumps right where it needs
to<00:01:42.479> be<00:01:42.540> it<00:01:42.810> looks<00:01:42.960> a<00:01:43.229> lot<00:01:43.439> more<00:01:43.500> natural<00:01:44.280> so

00:01:44.600 --> 00:01:44.610 
to be it looks a lot more natural so

00:01:44.610 --> 00:01:46.910 
to be it looks a lot more natural so
it's<00:01:45.240> really<00:01:45.600> simple<00:01:45.869> to<00:01:46.049> just<00:01:46.320> you<00:01:46.890> know

00:01:46.910 --> 00:01:46.920 
it's really simple to just you know

00:01:46.920 --> 00:01:51.080 
it's really simple to just you know
bring<00:01:47.520> that<00:01:47.700> in<00:01:47.909> now<00:01:48.570> if<00:01:49.380> we're<00:01:49.880> wanting<00:01:50.880> to

00:01:51.080 --> 00:01:51.090 
bring that in now if we're wanting to

00:01:51.090 --> 00:01:53.749 
bring that in now if we're wanting to
sink<00:01:52.049> that<00:01:52.290> right<00:01:52.829> down<00:01:53.009> here<00:01:53.189> we<00:01:53.369> can<00:01:53.520> see<00:01:53.729> our

00:01:53.749 --> 00:01:53.759 
sink that right down here we can see our

00:01:53.759 --> 00:01:54.560 
sink that right down here we can see our
different

00:01:54.560 --> 00:01:54.570 
different

00:01:54.570 --> 00:01:56.270 
different
just<00:01:54.720> what<00:01:55.530> we're<00:01:55.650> going<00:01:55.740> to<00:01:55.830> do<00:01:56.010> is<00:01:56.159> we're

00:01:56.270 --> 00:01:56.280 
just what we're going to do is we're

00:01:56.280 --> 00:01:58.160 
just what we're going to do is we're
going<00:01:56.370> to<00:01:56.460> make<00:01:56.670> sure<00:01:56.850> we<00:01:57.000> have<00:01:57.240> both<00:01:57.840> of<00:01:57.870> our

00:01:58.160 --> 00:01:58.170 
going to make sure we have both of our

00:01:58.170 --> 00:02:00.950 
going to make sure we have both of our
image<00:01:58.560> is<00:01:58.770> selected<00:01:59.040> so<00:02:00.030> this<00:02:00.240> is<00:02:00.450> the<00:02:00.810> one

00:02:00.950 --> 00:02:00.960 
image is selected so this is the one

00:02:00.960 --> 00:02:04.100 
image is selected so this is the one
we're<00:02:01.140> going<00:02:01.229> to<00:02:01.940> shoot<00:02:02.940> our<00:02:03.090> target<00:02:03.540> to<00:02:03.750> this

00:02:04.100 --> 00:02:04.110 
we're going to shoot our target to this

00:02:04.110 --> 00:02:06.740 
we're going to shoot our target to this
is<00:02:04.290> our<00:02:04.470> original<00:02:04.700> so<00:02:05.700> I've<00:02:06.060> got<00:02:06.240> both<00:02:06.450> of<00:02:06.479> them

00:02:06.740 --> 00:02:06.750 
is our original so I've got both of them

00:02:06.750 --> 00:02:08.570 
is our original so I've got both of them
selecting<00:02:07.200> and<00:02:07.350> see<00:02:07.530> their<00:02:07.680> highlight<00:02:08.039> but

00:02:08.570 --> 00:02:08.580 
selecting and see their highlight but

00:02:08.580 --> 00:02:11.270 
selecting and see their highlight but
this<00:02:08.789> one's<00:02:09.060> the<00:02:09.229> double<00:02:10.229> bit<00:02:10.410> wider<00:02:10.979> white

00:02:11.270 --> 00:02:11.280 
this one's the double bit wider white

00:02:11.280 --> 00:02:13.760 
this one's the double bit wider white
that<00:02:11.550> means<00:02:11.760> that's<00:02:12.060> the<00:02:12.270> active<00:02:12.780> one<00:02:12.990> now

00:02:13.760 --> 00:02:13.770 
that means that's the active one now

00:02:13.770 --> 00:02:14.840 
that means that's the active one now
what<00:02:14.010> we're<00:02:14.130> going<00:02:14.220> to<00:02:14.310> do<00:02:14.459> is<00:02:14.550> we're<00:02:14.700> going<00:02:14.790> to

a bunch of things are checked i'm just
going<00:02:25.350> to<00:02:25.380> check<00:02:25.620> none<00:02:25.950> and<00:02:26.220> then<00:02:26.850> go<00:02:27.000> back<00:02:27.150> and

click on my white balance because that's

00:02:29.070 --> 00:02:32.560 
click on my white balance because that's
what<00:02:29.280> i'm<00:02:29.430> updating<00:02:30.239> now<00:02:30.780> if<00:02:31.080> I<00:02:31.170> synchronize

00:02:32.560 --> 00:02:32.570 
what i'm updating now if I synchronize

00:02:32.570 --> 00:02:35.870 
what i'm updating now if I synchronize
you'll<00:02:33.570> actually<00:02:34.140> see<00:02:34.620> that<00:02:34.800> if<00:02:35.010> I<00:02:35.130> go<00:02:35.340> down<00:02:35.370> to

00:02:35.870 --> 00:02:35.880 
you'll actually see that if I go down to

00:02:35.880 --> 00:02:38.600 
you'll actually see that if I go down to
my<00:02:36.120> new<00:02:36.300> one<00:02:36.800> you're<00:02:37.800> going<00:02:37.920> to<00:02:37.980> see<00:02:38.220> the

00:02:38.600 --> 00:02:38.610 
my new one you're going to see the

00:02:38.610 --> 00:02:41.360 
my new one you're going to see the
updated<00:02:39.150> before<00:02:39.900> it<00:02:39.989> look<00:02:40.140> like<00:02:40.320> that<00:02:40.530> that's

00:02:41.360 --> 00:02:41.370 
updated before it look like that that's

00:02:41.370 --> 00:02:42.800 
updated before it look like that that's
what<00:02:41.670> it<00:02:41.700> looks<00:02:41.880> like<00:02:42.000> now<00:02:42.060> so<00:02:42.510> if<00:02:42.630> you're

00:02:42.800 --> 00:02:42.810 
what it looks like now so if you're

00:02:42.810 --> 00:02:46.729 
what it looks like now so if you're
shooting<00:02:43.020> in<00:02:43.650> a<00:02:44.280> in<00:02:45.270> a<00:02:45.780> room<00:02:45.989> or<00:02:46.260> whatever<00:02:46.410> all

00:02:46.729 --> 00:02:46.739 
shooting in a in a room or whatever all

00:02:46.739 --> 00:02:48.770 
shooting in a in a room or whatever all
the<00:02:46.890> lighting<00:02:47.100> is<00:02:47.310> consistent<00:02:48.060> you<00:02:48.570> only

00:02:48.770 --> 00:02:48.780 
the lighting is consistent you only

00:02:48.780 --> 00:02:50.420 
the lighting is consistent you only
really<00:02:49.050> need<00:02:49.170> the<00:02:49.410> white<00:02:49.590> balance<00:02:49.830> once

00:02:50.420 --> 00:02:50.430 
really need the white balance once

00:02:50.430 --> 00:02:52.310 
really need the white balance once
unless<00:02:50.850> if<00:02:51.090> the<00:02:51.209> lighting<00:02:51.450> situation<00:02:52.170> really

00:02:52.310 --> 00:02:52.320 
unless if the lighting situation really

00:02:52.320 --> 00:02:55.699 
unless if the lighting situation really
changes<00:02:53.030> so<00:02:54.030> if<00:02:54.390> you<00:02:54.600> have<00:02:54.930> a<00:02:54.959> whole<00:02:55.350> bunch<00:02:55.470> of

00:02:55.699 --> 00:02:55.709 
changes so if you have a whole bunch of

00:02:55.709 --> 00:02:58.370 
changes so if you have a whole bunch of
photos<00:02:55.920> within<00:02:56.400> a<00:02:56.670> the<00:02:57.090> same<00:02:57.360> range<00:02:57.660> you<00:02:58.170> can

00:02:58.370 --> 00:02:58.380 
photos within a the same range you can

00:02:58.380 --> 00:03:00.680 
photos within a the same range you can
do<00:02:58.590> you<00:02:58.950> know<00:02:59.070> a<00:02:59.100> couple<00:02:59.310> dozen<00:02:59.820> photos<00:03:00.209> if<00:03:00.570> you

00:03:00.680 --> 00:03:00.690 
do you know a couple dozen photos if you

00:03:00.690 --> 00:03:02.780 
do you know a couple dozen photos if you
want<00:03:00.900> to<00:03:01.110> you<00:03:01.200> could<00:03:01.350> light<00:03:01.560> balance<00:03:01.920> all<00:03:02.160> or

00:03:02.780 --> 00:03:02.790 
want to you could light balance all or

00:03:02.790 --> 00:03:05.479 
want to you could light balance all or
white<00:03:03.030> balance<00:03:03.330> all<00:03:03.480> off<00:03:03.690> of<00:03:03.900> one<00:03:04.290> image<00:03:04.860> so

00:03:05.479 --> 00:03:05.489 
white balance all off of one image so

00:03:05.489 --> 00:03:07.370 
white balance all off of one image so
you<00:03:05.549> do<00:03:05.820> you<00:03:06.090> take<00:03:06.299> the<00:03:06.420> shot<00:03:06.660> with<00:03:06.870> the<00:03:07.110> Zeta

00:03:07.370 --> 00:03:07.380 
you do you take the shot with the Zeta

00:03:07.380 --> 00:03:08.870 
you do you take the shot with the Zeta
notes<00:03:07.590> in<00:03:07.769> there<00:03:07.920> you<00:03:08.100> can<00:03:08.250> use<00:03:08.370> as<00:03:08.580> a<00:03:08.610> white

00:03:08.870 --> 00:03:08.880 
notes in there you can use as a white

00:03:08.880 --> 00:03:10.640 
notes in there you can use as a white
balance<00:03:09.269> and<00:03:09.360> then<00:03:09.959> you<00:03:10.049> can<00:03:10.200> balance<00:03:10.350> the

00:03:10.640 --> 00:03:10.650 
balance and then you can balance the

00:03:10.650 --> 00:03:11.870 
balance and then you can balance the
rest<00:03:10.829> of<00:03:10.980> your<00:03:11.100> images

00:03:11.870 --> 00:03:11.880 
rest of your images

00:03:11.880 --> 00:03:13.640 
rest of your images
I'll<00:03:12.510> just<00:03:12.690> show<00:03:12.810> you<00:03:12.840> one<00:03:13.020> more<00:03:13.080> real<00:03:13.410> quickly

00:03:13.640 --> 00:03:13.650 
I'll just show you one more real quickly

00:03:13.650 --> 00:03:15.860 
I'll just show you one more real quickly
again<00:03:13.920> another<00:03:14.610> scene<00:03:15.030> what<00:03:15.540> we're<00:03:15.690> going<00:03:15.780> to

00:03:15.860 --> 00:03:15.870 
again another scene what we're going to

00:03:15.870 --> 00:03:19.310 
again another scene what we're going to
do<00:03:16.100> we've<00:03:17.100> got<00:03:17.340> the<00:03:17.850> eyedropper<00:03:18.570> tool<00:03:18.600> here

00:03:19.310 --> 00:03:19.320 
do we've got the eyedropper tool here

00:03:19.320 --> 00:03:21.530 
do we've got the eyedropper tool here
we've<00:03:19.500> got<00:03:19.530> our<00:03:19.740> Z<00:03:20.550> bounds<00:03:20.910> kind<00:03:21.150> of<00:03:21.240> right<00:03:21.420> off

00:03:21.530 --> 00:03:21.540
