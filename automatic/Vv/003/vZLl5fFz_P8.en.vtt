down<00:00:43.590> the<00:00:43.710> transform<00:00:44.370> is<00:00:44.579> a<00:00:44.820> better<00:00:45.090> camera

00:00:45.470 --> 00:00:45.480 
down the transform is a better camera

00:00:45.480 --> 00:00:48.670 
down the transform is a better camera
pictures<00:00:46.440> we're<00:00:47.039> still<00:00:47.340> not<00:00:47.520> excellent<00:00:48.270> and

00:00:48.670 --> 00:00:48.680 
pictures we're still not excellent and

00:00:48.680 --> 00:00:51.319 
pictures we're still not excellent and
it<00:00:49.680> wasn't<00:00:49.950> quite<00:00:50.399> up<00:00:50.430> to<00:00:50.579> par<00:00:50.730> with<00:00:51.090> what<00:00:51.120> I

00:00:51.319 --> 00:00:51.329 
it wasn't quite up to par with what I

00:00:51.329 --> 00:00:53.619 
it wasn't quite up to par with what I
expected<00:00:52.079> for<00:00:52.379> a<00:00:52.440> 3<00:00:52.649> megapixel<00:00:52.800> autofocus

00:00:53.619 --> 00:00:53.629 
expected for a 3 megapixel autofocus

00:00:53.629 --> 00:00:56.450 
expected for a 3 megapixel autofocus
camera<00:00:54.629> in<00:00:54.840> a<00:00:54.870> flash<00:00:55.170> but<00:00:55.920> that<00:00:56.190> being<00:00:56.399> said

00:00:56.450 --> 00:00:56.460 
camera in a flash but that being said

00:00:56.460 --> 00:00:58.310 
camera in a flash but that being said
it's<00:00:56.850> still<00:00:56.940> much<00:00:57.600> better<00:00:57.629> than<00:00:58.020> a<00:00:58.079> 2

00:00:58.310 --> 00:00:58.320 
it's still much better than a 2

00:00:58.320 --> 00:01:00.529 
it's still much better than a 2
megapixel<00:00:58.410> fixed<00:00:59.100> focus<00:00:59.399> camera<00:00:59.670> I<00:01:00.000> think

00:01:00.529 --> 00:01:00.539 
megapixel fixed focus camera I think

00:01:00.539 --> 00:01:02.750 
megapixel fixed focus camera I think
this<00:01:00.660> is<00:01:00.719> very<00:01:01.079> under<00:01:01.859> SPECT<00:01:02.219> when<00:01:02.430> it<00:01:02.550> comes

00:01:02.750 --> 00:01:02.760 
this is very under SPECT when it comes

00:01:02.760 --> 00:01:05.929 
this is very under SPECT when it comes
to<00:01:03.120> two<00:01:03.780> cameras<00:01:04.320> you<00:01:04.470> even<00:01:04.799> for<00:01:05.010> a<00:01:05.070> low-end<00:01:05.729> or

00:01:05.929 --> 00:01:05.939 
to two cameras you even for a low-end or

00:01:05.939 --> 00:01:08.539 
to two cameras you even for a low-end or
mid-range<00:01:06.299> smartphone<00:01:06.900> the<00:01:07.860> pictures<00:01:08.280> were

00:01:08.539 --> 00:01:08.549 
mid-range smartphone the pictures were

00:01:08.549 --> 00:01:10.730 
mid-range smartphone the pictures were
better<00:01:08.909> than<00:01:09.750> what<00:01:09.960> i<00:01:09.990> expected<00:01:10.080> color

00:01:10.730 --> 00:01:10.740 
better than what i expected color

00:01:10.740 --> 00:01:13.760 
better than what i expected color
saturation<00:01:11.250> was<00:01:11.580> better<00:01:11.820> but<00:01:12.479> still<00:01:12.770> the

00:01:13.760 --> 00:01:13.770 
saturation was better but still the

00:01:13.770 --> 00:01:15.830 
saturation was better but still the
transform<00:01:14.369> wins<00:01:14.580> this<00:01:14.760> one<00:01:15.030> and<00:01:15.299> then<00:01:15.720> the

00:01:15.830 --> 00:01:15.840 
transform wins this one and then the

00:01:15.840 --> 00:01:18.770 
transform wins this one and then the
front-facing<00:01:16.229> camera<00:01:16.950> if<00:01:17.729> you<00:01:17.970> do<00:01:18.180> a<00:01:18.509> lot<00:01:18.720> of

00:01:18.770 --> 00:01:18.780 
front-facing camera if you do a lot of

00:01:18.780 --> 00:01:20.359 
front-facing camera if you do a lot of
video<00:01:19.140> chatting<00:01:19.560> you<00:01:19.590> can<00:01:19.920> use<00:01:20.040> it<00:01:20.159> for<00:01:20.250> that

00:01:20.359 --> 00:01:20.369 
video chatting you can use it for that

00:01:20.369 --> 00:01:24.050 
video chatting you can use it for that
it's<00:01:20.549> a<00:01:20.670> vga<00:01:21.229> quality<00:01:22.340> camera<00:01:23.340> now<00:01:23.820> if<00:01:23.909> we<00:01:24.030> go

00:01:24.050 --> 00:01:24.060 
it's a vga quality camera now if we go

00:01:24.060 --> 00:01:26.660 
it's a vga quality camera now if we go
again<00:01:24.360> to<00:01:24.810> the<00:01:24.840> back<00:01:25.290> of<00:01:25.320> the<00:01:25.619> phones<00:01:26.009> will

00:01:26.660 --> 00:01:26.670 
again to the back of the phones will

00:01:26.670 --> 00:01:30.859 
again to the back of the phones will
take<00:01:26.909> a<00:01:26.939> look<00:01:27.270> at<00:01:27.509> the<00:01:28.340> battery<00:01:29.340> and<00:01:29.869> also

00:01:30.859 --> 00:01:30.869 
take a look at the battery and also

00:01:30.869 --> 00:01:35.420 
take a look at the battery and also
memory<00:01:31.500> will<00:01:31.650> talk<00:01:31.799> about<00:01:31.920> that<00:01:32.070> too<00:01:32.689> oops<00:01:34.430> so

00:01:35.420 --> 00:01:35.430 
memory will talk about that too oops so

00:01:35.430 --> 00:01:39.140 
memory will talk about that too oops so
take<00:01:36.030> this<00:01:36.420> off<00:01:36.720> the<00:01:37.710> transform<00:01:38.610> shifts<00:01:39.030> with

00:01:39.140 --> 00:01:39.150 
take this off the transform shifts with

00:01:39.150 --> 00:01:41.330 
take this off the transform shifts with
a<00:01:39.180> 1,500<00:01:40.140> milliamp<00:01:40.470> hour<00:01:40.650> battery<00:01:40.770> and

hour battery and some battery life was
good<00:01:47.759> for<00:01:48.270> both<00:01:48.479> phones<00:01:48.840> but<00:01:49.470> it<00:01:49.560> was<00:01:49.680> better

00:01:49.880 --> 00:01:49.890 
good for both phones but it was better

00:01:49.890 --> 00:01:52.789

replenish<00:02:16.540> also<00:02:16.989> got<00:02:17.170> me<00:02:17.290> through<00:02:17.500> a<00:02:17.530> full<00:02:17.739> day

00:02:17.970 --> 00:02:17.980 
replenish also got me through a full day

00:02:17.980 --> 00:02:20.280 
replenish also got me through a full day
so<00:02:18.150> the<00:02:19.150> bottom<00:02:19.299> line<00:02:19.480> is<00:02:19.659> that<00:02:19.870> you<00:02:20.140> can

00:02:20.280 --> 00:02:20.290 
so the bottom line is that you can

00:02:20.290 --> 00:02:23.640 
so the bottom line is that you can
easily<00:02:20.530> get<00:02:20.890> through<00:02:21.189> one<00:02:21.489> full<00:02:21.969> day<00:02:22.650> with

00:02:23.640 --> 00:02:23.650 
easily get through one full day with

00:02:23.650 --> 00:02:26.220 
easily get through one full day with
each<00:02:23.980> phone<00:02:24.340> but<00:02:25.150> with<00:02:25.299> a<00:02:25.329> transform<00:02:26.019> you

00:02:26.220 --> 00:02:26.230 
each phone but with a transform you

00:02:26.230 --> 00:02:29.009 
each phone but with a transform you
might<00:02:26.590> be<00:02:26.829> able<00:02:26.950> to<00:02:27.099> get<00:02:27.459> two<00:02:28.090> days<00:02:28.359> if<00:02:28.659> you<00:02:28.689> use

00:02:29.009 --> 00:02:29.019 
might be able to get two days if you use

00:02:29.019 --> 00:02:30.690 
might be able to get two days if you use
your<00:02:29.200> battery<00:02:29.620> wisely<00:02:30.159> and<00:02:30.280> you<00:02:30.489> know<00:02:30.579> you're

going to have to charge both of them at

00:02:36.010 --> 00:02:38.039 
going to have to charge both of them at
night<00:02:36.370> but<00:02:36.909> if<00:02:37.000> you<00:02:37.120> wanted<00:02:37.390> to<00:02:37.540> get<00:02:37.629> two<00:02:37.870> days

night but if you wanted to get two days

00:02:38.049 --> 00:02:39.750 
night but if you wanted to get two days
you<00:02:38.290> might<00:02:38.439> be<00:02:38.590> able<00:02:38.650> to<00:02:38.769> do<00:02:38.920> with<00:02:39.069> a<00:02:39.099> transform

00:02:39.750 --> 00:02:39.760 
you might be able to do with a transform

00:02:39.760 --> 00:02:41.490 
you might be able to do with a transform
but<00:02:40.180> battery<00:02:40.359> life<00:02:40.689> was<00:02:40.900> still<00:02:41.139> good<00:02:41.319> with

00:02:41.490 --> 00:02:41.500 
but battery life was still good with

00:02:41.500 --> 00:02:44.520 
but battery life was still good with
both<00:02:41.709> devices<00:02:42.420> I<00:02:43.420> mention<00:02:44.139> that<00:02:44.170> we<00:02:44.319> talked

00:02:44.520 --> 00:02:44.530 
both devices I mention that we talked

00:02:44.530 --> 00:02:46.770 
both devices I mention that we talked
about<00:02:44.560> memory<00:02:45.129> the<00:02:45.609> memory<00:02:45.639> card<00:02:46.180> slot<00:02:46.510> for

about memory the memory card slot for

00:02:46.780 --> 00:02:48.690 
about memory the memory card slot for
each<00:02:46.989> phone<00:02:47.290> is<00:02:47.680> underneath<00:02:48.310> the<00:02:48.489> battery

00:02:48.690 --> 00:02:48.700 
each phone is underneath the battery

00:02:48.700 --> 00:02:51.059 
each phone is underneath the battery
cover<00:02:49.090> which<00:02:49.870> I<00:02:49.989> don't<00:02:50.170> understand<00:02:50.680> for<00:02:50.919> other

cover which I don't understand for other

00:02:51.069 --> 00:02:53.009 
cover which I don't understand for other
one<00:02:51.340> because<00:02:51.519> as<00:02:51.790> you<00:02:51.879> can<00:02:52.030> see<00:02:52.209> it's<00:02:52.359> on<00:02:52.629> the

00:02:53.009 --> 00:02:53.019 
one because as you can see it's on the

00:02:53.019 --> 00:02:55.319 
one because as you can see it's on the
side<00:02:53.319> here<00:02:53.519> I<00:02:54.519> don't<00:02:54.879> know<00:02:54.939> if<00:02:55.030> you<00:02:55.090> want<00:02:55.239> to

00:02:55.319 --> 00:02:55.329 
side here I don't know if you want to

00:02:55.329 --> 00:02:57.300 
side here I don't know if you want to
see<00:02:55.540> that<00:02:55.750> so<00:02:56.290> they're<00:02:56.409> honest<00:02:56.680> on<00:02:56.980> this<00:02:57.069> side

00:02:57.300 --> 00:02:57.310 
see that so they're honest on this side

00:02:57.310 --> 00:02:59.129 
see that so they're honest on this side
right<00:02:57.340> there<00:02:57.790> so<00:02:58.329> you<00:02:58.750> know<00:02:58.810> they<00:02:58.930> easily

00:02:59.129 --> 00:02:59.139 
right there so you know they easily

00:02:59.139 --> 00:03:02.339 
right there so you know they easily
could<00:02:59.349> have<00:02:59.560> added<00:02:59.799> a<00:03:00.069> slot<00:03:00.489> in<00:03:01.359> the<00:03:01.569> cover<00:03:02.049> but

00:03:02.339 --> 00:03:02.349 
could have added a slot in the cover but

00:03:02.349 --> 00:03:04.170 
could have added a slot in the cover but
whatever<00:03:02.769> you<00:03:03.489> don't<00:03:03.639> have<00:03:03.730> to<00:03:03.819> take<00:03:03.939> out<00:03:04.060> the

00:03:05.520 --> 00:03:05.530 
battery at leas you just have to take

00:03:05.530 --> 00:03:07.770 
battery at leas you just have to take
off<00:03:05.709> the<00:03:05.829> battery<00:03:06.040> cover<00:03:06.419> both<00:03:07.419> phones

00:03:07.770 --> 00:03:07.780 
off the battery cover both phones

00:03:07.780 --> 00:03:10.589 
off the battery cover both phones
shipped<00:03:08.169> with<00:03:08.439> a<00:03:08.470> 2<00:03:08.680> gigabyte<00:03:09.459> card<00:03:09.700> and<00:03:10.060> they

00:03:10.589 --> 00:03:10.599 
shipped with a 2 gigabyte card and they

00:03:10.599 --> 00:03:13.110 
shipped with a 2 gigabyte card and they
both<00:03:10.840> support<00:03:11.409> up<00:03:11.560> to<00:03:11.590> 32<00:03:12.489> gigabytes<00:03:12.939> so

00:03:13.110 --> 00:03:13.120 
both support up to 32 gigabytes so

00:03:13.120 --> 00:03:15.149 
both support up to 32 gigabytes so
that's<00:03:13.329> nice<00:03:13.599> it<00:03:14.530> seems<00:03:14.799> to<00:03:14.919> be<00:03:15.040> a<00:03:15.069> trend

00:03:15.149 --> 00:03:15.159 
that's nice it seems to be a trend

00:03:15.159 --> 00:03:18.449 
that's nice it seems to be a trend
lately<00:03:15.900> manufacturers<00:03:16.900> shipping<00:03:17.459> their

00:03:24.360 --> 00:03:24.370 
it used to be used to didn't ship with

00:03:24.370 --> 00:03:26.879 
it used to be used to didn't ship with
anything<00:03:24.760> so<00:03:25.060> memories<00:03:26.019> about<00:03:26.139> the<00:03:26.319> same<00:03:26.590> ship

00:03:26.879 --> 00:03:26.889 
anything so memories about the same ship

00:03:26.889 --> 00:03:29.430 
anything so memories about the same ship
both<00:03:27.129> ships<00:03:27.489> with<00:03:27.699> two<00:03:28.000> gig<00:03:28.269> cards<00:03:28.690> and

00:03:29.430 --> 00:03:29.440 
both ships with two gig cards and

00:03:29.440 --> 00:03:32.520 
both ships with two gig cards and
because<00:03:29.859> they<00:03:30.459> both<00:03:30.639> you<00:03:31.239> can<00:03:31.419> upgrade<00:03:31.659> the

00:03:32.520 --> 00:03:32.530 
because they both you can upgrade the

00:03:32.530 --> 00:03:34.860 
because they both you can upgrade the
transform<00:03:33.129> to<00:03:33.220> 2.2<00:03:33.909> and<00:03:34.090> the<00:03:34.150> replenished

00:03:34.860 --> 00:03:34.870 
transform to 2.2 and the replenished

00:03:34.870 --> 00:03:38.789 
transform to 2.2 and the replenished
ships<00:03:35.109> with<00:03:35.290> 2.2<00:03:35.519> you<00:03:36.519> can<00:03:36.849> of<00:03:37.060> course<00:03:37.799> send

00:03:38.789 --> 00:03:38.799 
ships with 2.2 you can of course send

00:03:38.799 --> 00:03:40.890 
ships with 2.2 you can of course send
your<00:03:39.129> apps<00:03:39.400> or<00:03:39.879> save<00:03:40.180> your<00:03:40.209> apps<00:03:40.510> to<00:03:40.870> the

memory card so that to get card will
come<00:03:42.849> in<00:03:42.970> handy<00:03:43.049> so<00:03:44.049> let's<00:03:44.349> go<00:03:44.530> over<00:03:44.560> to<00:03:44.769> the

00:03:45.240 --> 00:03:45.250 
come in handy so let's go over to the

00:03:45.250 --> 00:03:50.089 
come in handy so let's go over to the
web<00:03:45.459> browser<00:03:46.139> for<00:03:47.139> both<00:03:47.319> of<00:03:47.530> these<00:03:47.650> phones<00:03:48.099> and

00:03:50.089 --> 00:03:50.099 
web browser for both of these phones and

00:03:50.099 --> 00:03:52.800 
web browser for both of these phones and
take<00:03:51.099> a<00:03:51.129> look<00:03:51.400> at<00:03:51.549> that<00:03:51.579> they<00:03:52.209> are<00:03:52.359> both<00:03:52.569> on

00:03:52.800 --> 00:03:52.810 
take a look at that they are both on

00:03:52.810 --> 00:03:56.580 
take a look at that they are both on
sprint's<00:03:53.319> network<00:03:53.349> so<00:03:54.159> you<00:03:54.669> know<00:03:54.790> honestly<00:03:55.590> 3G

00:03:56.580 --> 00:03:56.590 
sprint's network so you know honestly 3G

00:03:56.590 --> 00:03:58.080 
sprint's network so you know honestly 3G
speeds<00:03:56.829> are<00:03:57.040> going<00:03:57.189> to<00:03:57.250> be<00:03:57.430> basically<00:03:57.729> the

00:03:58.080 --> 00:03:58.090 
speeds are going to be basically the

00:03:58.090 --> 00:04:01.020 
speeds are going to be basically the
same<00:03:58.389> but<00:03:58.919> you<00:03:59.919> can<00:04:00.069> see<00:04:00.220> the<00:04:00.340> transform<00:04:00.909> is

00:04:01.020 --> 00:04:01.030 
same but you can see the transform is

00:04:01.030 --> 00:04:02.580 
same but you can see the transform is
for<00:04:01.209> some<00:04:01.359> reason<00:04:01.629> having<00:04:01.840> some<00:04:02.139> problems

00:04:02.580 --> 00:04:02.590 
for some reason having some problems

00:04:02.590 --> 00:04:06.420 
for some reason having some problems
loading<00:04:02.859> the<00:04:03.159> web<00:04:03.370> browser<00:04:03.609> but<00:04:05.040> with<00:04:06.040> that

00:04:06.420 --> 00:04:06.430 
loading the web browser but with that

00:04:06.430 --> 00:04:12.270 
loading the web browser but with that
and<00:04:06.879> we'll<00:04:07.000> go<00:04:07.150> to<00:04:07.209> phone.com

00:04:12.270 --> 00:04:12.280 

00:04:12.280 --> 00:04:14.890 

just<00:04:13.280> to<00:04:13.370> take<00:04:13.580> a<00:04:13.610> look<00:04:13.910> you<00:04:14.360> know<00:04:14.450> see<00:04:14.720> how

00:04:14.890 --> 00:04:14.900 
just to take a look you know see how

00:04:14.900 --> 00:04:17.500 
just to take a look you know see how
they<00:04:15.080> load<00:04:15.410> will<00:04:16.070> use<00:04:16.220> pinch<00:04:16.579> to<00:04:16.790> zoom<00:04:16.820> again

00:04:17.500 --> 00:04:17.510 
they load will use pinch to zoom again

00:04:17.510 --> 00:04:22.260 
they load will use pinch to zoom again
and<00:04:17.930> see<00:04:18.560> how<00:04:18.680> the<00:04:18.739> processors<00:04:19.549> handle<00:04:20.090> it

00:04:22.260 --> 00:04:22.270 

00:04:22.270 --> 00:04:36.600 

dog.com<00:04:29.320> go<00:04:31.450> k

00:04:36.600 --> 00:04:36.610 

00:04:36.610 --> 00:04:39.310 

so<00:04:37.610> of<00:04:37.880> course<00:04:37.910> the<00:04:38.450> replenish<00:04:38.870> had<00:04:39.050> a<00:04:39.080> head

00:04:39.310 --> 00:04:39.320 
so of course the replenish had a head

00:04:39.320 --> 00:04:41.380 
so of course the replenish had a head
start<00:04:39.620> so<00:04:39.950> we're<00:04:40.100> not<00:04:40.220> going<00:04:40.400> to<00:04:40.490> judge<00:04:40.910> speeds

00:04:41.380 --> 00:04:41.390 
start so we're not going to judge speeds

00:04:41.390 --> 00:04:43.570 
start so we're not going to judge speeds
here<00:04:41.780> but<00:04:42.020> um<00:04:42.170> I<00:04:42.440> do<00:04:42.830> want<00:04:43.130> to<00:04:43.220> show<00:04:43.370> you<00:04:43.460> the

00:04:43.570 --> 00:04:43.580 
here but um I do want to show you the

00:04:43.580 --> 00:04:46.030 
here but um I do want to show you the
pinch<00:04:43.850> to<00:04:44.060> zoom<00:04:44.090> just<00:04:44.570> to<00:04:44.690> show<00:04:44.870> you<00:04:45.040> processor

00:04:46.030 --> 00:04:46.040 
pinch to zoom just to show you processor

00:04:46.040 --> 00:04:47.590 
pinch to zoom just to show you processor
and<00:04:46.190> basically<00:04:46.550> you<00:04:47.120> know<00:04:47.210> I<00:04:47.240> talked<00:04:47.480> about

00:04:47.590 --> 00:04:47.600 
and basically you know I talked about

00:04:47.600 --> 00:04:50.230 
and basically you know I talked about
the<00:04:47.750> process<00:04:48.260> on<00:04:48.410> the<00:04:48.470> transform<00:04:49.130> being<00:04:49.400> slow

00:04:50.230 --> 00:04:50.240 
the process on the transform being slow

00:04:50.240 --> 00:04:52.030 
the process on the transform being slow
and<00:04:50.540> laggy<00:04:50.750> so<00:04:51.140> I<00:04:51.170> just<00:04:51.380> want<00:04:51.530> to<00:04:51.560> compare<00:04:52.010> that

00:04:52.030 --> 00:04:52.040 
and laggy so I just want to compare that

00:04:52.040 --> 00:04:55.710 
and laggy so I just want to compare that
in<00:04:52.550> the<00:04:52.730> web<00:04:52.940> browser<00:04:53.950> okay<00:04:54.950> so<00:04:55.040> here<00:04:55.340> we<00:04:55.460> have

00:04:55.710 --> 00:04:55.720 
in the web browser okay so here we have

00:04:55.720 --> 00:04:58.810 
in the web browser okay so here we have
both<00:04:56.720> phones<00:04:56.990> have<00:04:57.170> loaded<00:04:57.590> phoneDog<00:04:58.250> calm

00:04:58.810 --> 00:04:58.820 
both phones have loaded phoneDog calm

00:04:58.820 --> 00:05:02.530 
both phones have loaded phoneDog calm
and<00:04:59.270> we<00:05:00.140> can<00:05:00.320> zoom<00:05:00.350> in<00:05:00.920> and<00:05:01.340> out<00:05:01.550> you<00:05:02.240> can<00:05:02.330> see

00:05:02.530 --> 00:05:02.540 
and we can zoom in and out you can see

00:05:02.540 --> 00:05:04.840 
and we can zoom in and out you can see
that<00:05:02.570> processor<00:05:03.260> just<00:05:03.530> handles<00:05:04.040> it<00:05:04.220> very<00:05:04.250> well

00:05:04.840 --> 00:05:04.850 
that processor just handles it very well

00:05:04.850 --> 00:05:08.170 
that processor just handles it very well
we<00:05:05.420> even<00:05:05.600> have<00:05:05.780> some<00:05:05.810> flash<00:05:06.350> content<00:05:07.180> loaded

00:05:08.170 --> 00:05:08.180 
we even have some flash content loaded

00:05:08.180 --> 00:05:11.260 
we even have some flash content loaded
on<00:05:08.420> the<00:05:08.570> page<00:05:08.870> but<00:05:09.590> just<00:05:09.920> pinch<00:05:10.340> to<00:05:10.580> zoom<00:05:10.610> is<00:05:11.030> is

00:05:11.260 --> 00:05:11.270 
on the page but just pinch to zoom is is

00:05:11.270 --> 00:05:14.980 
on the page but just pinch to zoom is is
very<00:05:11.630> smooth<00:05:12.170> seamless<00:05:13.130> it<00:05:13.730> works<00:05:14.120> it's<00:05:14.690> just

00:05:14.980 --> 00:05:14.990 
very smooth seamless it works it's just

00:05:14.990 --> 00:05:16.300 
very smooth seamless it works it's just
great<00:05:15.260> it's<00:05:15.380> incredible<00:05:15.830> i<00:05:15.920> was<00:05:16.070> very

00:05:16.300 --> 00:05:16.310 
great it's incredible i was very

00:05:16.310 --> 00:05:18.730 
great it's incredible i was very
surprised<00:05:16.940> by<00:05:17.510> the<00:05:17.570> performance<00:05:18.140> of<00:05:18.380> the

00:05:18.730 --> 00:05:18.740 
surprised by the performance of the

00:05:18.740 --> 00:05:20.080 
surprised by the performance of the
processor<00:05:18.980> on<00:05:19.400> the<00:05:19.430> replenish<00:05:19.910> now<00:05:20.030> the

00:05:20.080 --> 00:05:20.090 
processor on the replenish now the

00:05:20.090 --> 00:05:22.810 
processor on the replenish now the
transform<00:05:20.870> is<00:05:21.320> a<00:05:21.380> completely<00:05:22.340> different

00:05:22.810 --> 00:05:22.820 
transform is a completely different

00:05:22.820 --> 00:05:25.690 
transform is a completely different
story<00:05:22.940> and<00:05:23.300> see<00:05:23.570> you<00:05:24.500> know<00:05:24.590> it's<00:05:24.770> not<00:05:24.950> terrible

00:05:25.690 --> 00:05:25.700 
story and see you know it's not terrible

00:05:25.700 --> 00:05:29.440 
story and see you know it's not terrible
but<00:05:25.760> it's<00:05:26.060> not<00:05:26.330> quite<00:05:26.630> as<00:05:27.910> smooth<00:05:28.910> or

00:05:29.440 --> 00:05:29.450 
but it's not quite as smooth or

00:05:29.450 --> 00:05:32.470 
but it's not quite as smooth or
responsive<00:05:30.350> as<00:05:30.620> the<00:05:31.090> replenish<00:05:32.090> its<00:05:32.300> just

00:05:32.470 --> 00:05:32.480 
responsive as the replenish its just

00:05:32.480 --> 00:05:37.300 
responsive as the replenish its just
choppy<00:05:33.290> and<00:05:33.530> laggy<00:05:35.440> scrolling<00:05:36.440> is<00:05:36.620> again

00:05:37.300 --> 00:05:37.310 
choppy and laggy scrolling is again

00:05:37.310 --> 00:05:40.090 
choppy and laggy scrolling is again
choppy<00:05:37.700> and<00:05:37.880> laggy<00:05:38.210> so<00:05:38.720> it's<00:05:39.560> just<00:05:39.770> you<00:05:40.010> know<00:05:40.040> I

00:05:40.090 --> 00:05:40.100 
choppy and laggy so it's just you know I

00:05:40.100 --> 00:05:41.560 
choppy and laggy so it's just you know I
had<00:05:40.250> a<00:05:40.280> lot<00:05:40.550> of<00:05:40.610> problems<00:05:41.060> with<00:05:41.180> the<00:05:41.270> process

00:05:41.560 --> 00:05:41.570 
had a lot of problems with the process

00:05:41.570 --> 00:05:44.380 
had a lot of problems with the process
from<00:05:41.960> the<00:05:42.020> transform<00:05:42.770> just<00:05:43.760> you<00:05:44.000> know<00:05:44.030> very

00:05:44.380 --> 00:05:44.390 
from the transform just you know very

00:05:44.390 --> 00:05:46.810 
from the transform just you know very
unresponsive<00:05:44.900> very<00:05:45.710> lanky<00:05:46.040> I<00:05:46.250> know<00:05:46.370> I've<00:05:46.640> said

00:05:46.810 --> 00:05:46.820 
unresponsive very lanky I know I've said

00:05:46.820 --> 00:05:48.190 
unresponsive very lanky I know I've said
this<00:05:46.880> already<00:05:47.180> and<00:05:47.480> I<00:05:47.630> probably<00:05:47.810> sound<00:05:48.020> like<00:05:48.110> a

00:05:48.190 --> 00:05:48.200 
this already and I probably sound like a

00:05:48.200 --> 00:05:51.250 
this already and I probably sound like a
broken<00:05:48.410> record<00:05:48.710> but<00:05:49.520> I<00:05:49.760> can't<00:05:50.180> to<00:05:50.810> me<00:05:50.990> I<00:05:51.020> think

00:05:51.250 --> 00:05:51.260 
broken record but I can't to me I think

00:05:51.260 --> 00:05:53.170 
broken record but I can't to me I think
the<00:05:51.680> biggest<00:05:51.890> problem<00:05:52.160> with<00:05:52.520> that<00:05:52.580> transform

00:05:53.170 --> 00:05:53.180 
the biggest problem with that transform

00:05:53.180 --> 00:05:55.690 
the biggest problem with that transform
is<00:05:53.360> just<00:05:53.570> simply<00:05:53.840> its<00:05:53.990> processor<00:05:54.770> in<00:05:55.010> pretty

00:05:55.690 --> 00:05:55.700 
is just simply its processor in pretty

00:05:55.700 --> 00:05:57.880 
is just simply its processor in pretty
much<00:05:55.760> every<00:05:56.240> other<00:05:56.270> way<00:05:56.720> it's<00:05:57.140> better<00:05:57.680> than

00:05:57.880 --> 00:05:57.890 
much every other way it's better than

00:05:57.890 --> 00:06:00.160 
much every other way it's better than
the<00:05:57.950> replenish<00:05:58.520> the<00:05:58.640> display<00:05:59.060> is<00:05:59.210> larger<00:05:59.690> the

00:06:00.160 --> 00:06:00.170 
the replenish the display is larger the

00:06:00.170 --> 00:06:01.810 
the replenish the display is larger the
camera<00:06:00.680> is<00:06:00.710> better<00:06:01.070> you<00:06:01.280> have<00:06:01.400> a<00:06:01.460> front<00:06:01.760> facing

00:06:01.810 --> 00:06:01.820 
camera is better you have a front facing

00:06:01.820 --> 00:06:05.980 
camera is better you have a front facing
camera<00:06:02.690> the<00:06:03.680> keyboard<00:06:03.980> is<00:06:04.520> also<00:06:05.030> larger<00:06:05.780> which

00:06:05.980 --> 00:06:05.990 
camera the keyboard is also larger which

00:06:05.990 --> 00:06:07.660 
camera the keyboard is also larger which
may<00:06:06.170> be<00:06:06.200> some<00:06:06.590> may<00:06:06.920> be<00:06:06.980> better<00:06:07.250> for<00:06:07.520> some

00:06:07.660 --> 00:06:07.670 
may be some may be better for some

00:06:07.670 --> 00:06:11.350 
may be some may be better for some
people<00:06:08.090> but<00:06:08.960> still<00:06:09.200> that<00:06:10.130> processor<00:06:10.910> is<00:06:11.120> just

00:06:11.350 --> 00:06:11.360 
people but still that processor is just

00:06:11.360 --> 00:06:13.870 
people but still that processor is just
terrible<00:06:11.810> and<00:06:12.110> it<00:06:12.230> makes<00:06:12.440> it<00:06:12.650> such<00:06:12.920> a<00:06:12.950> pain<00:06:13.520> to

00:06:13.870 --> 00:06:13.880 
terrible and it makes it such a pain to

00:06:13.880 --> 00:06:16.240 
terrible and it makes it such a pain to
use<00:06:14.240> and<00:06:14.510> so<00:06:14.960> you<00:06:15.470> just<00:06:15.800> for<00:06:16.070> that<00:06:16.100> reason

00:06:16.240 --> 00:06:16.250 
use and so you just for that reason

00:06:16.250 --> 00:06:18.970 
use and so you just for that reason
alone<00:06:16.700> I<00:06:17.300> would<00:06:17.810> say<00:06:18.020> go<00:06:18.200> with<00:06:18.320> the<00:06:18.470> replenish
