00:02:01.799 --> 00:02:04.719 
kind of fishing it really allows fish to
see<00:02:01.950> your<00:02:02.130> lure<00:02:02.280> from<00:02:02.579> a<00:02:02.700> long<00:02:03.030> ways<00:02:03.420> away<00:02:03.450> and

00:02:04.719 --> 00:02:04.729 
see your lure from a long ways away and

00:02:04.729 --> 00:02:08.419 
see your lure from a long ways away and
now<00:02:05.729> as<00:02:05.850> far<00:02:06.030> as<00:02:06.149> color<00:02:06.509> selection<00:02:07.170> goes<00:02:07.500> it's

00:02:08.419 --> 00:02:08.429 
now as far as color selection goes it's

00:02:08.429 --> 00:02:12.110 
now as far as color selection goes it's
really<00:02:08.849> tough<00:02:09.360> to<00:02:09.390> be<00:02:09.720> white<00:02:10.140> on<00:02:10.520> in<00:02:11.520> really

00:02:12.110 --> 00:02:12.120 
really tough to be white on in really

00:02:12.120 --> 00:02:14.390 
really tough to be white on in really
clear<00:02:12.420> body's<00:02:12.870> water<00:02:13.170> you<00:02:13.470> can<00:02:13.770> use<00:02:13.800> you<00:02:14.370> know

00:02:14.390 --> 00:02:14.400 
clear body's water you can use you know

00:02:14.400 --> 00:02:19.220 
clear body's water you can use you know
real<00:02:15.270> natural<00:02:15.629> colors<00:02:16.319> but<00:02:16.739> as<00:02:17.720> far<00:02:18.720> as<00:02:18.780> almost

00:02:19.220 --> 00:02:19.230 
real natural colors but as far as almost

00:02:19.230 --> 00:02:21.619 
real natural colors but as far as almost
all<00:02:19.410> line<00:02:19.920> through<00:02:20.250> fishing<00:02:20.580> goes<00:02:20.760> white<00:02:21.360> is<00:02:21.599> a

00:02:21.619 --> 00:02:21.629 
all line through fishing goes white is a

00:02:21.629 --> 00:02:24.140 
all line through fishing goes white is a
tough<00:02:22.050> color<00:02:22.319> to<00:02:22.560> be<00:02:22.709> just<00:02:23.430> because<00:02:23.700> fish<00:02:23.940> can

00:02:24.140 --> 00:02:24.150 
tough color to be just because fish can

00:02:24.150 --> 00:02:25.580 
tough color to be just because fish can
see<00:02:24.330> it<00:02:24.450> from<00:02:24.569> so<00:02:24.840> far<00:02:24.870> another<00:02:25.349> way<00:02:25.530> to

00:02:25.580 --> 00:02:25.590 
see it from so far another way to

00:02:25.590 --> 00:02:27.440 
see it from so far another way to
fishing<00:02:26.069> line<00:02:26.430> through<00:02:26.760> during<00:02:27.120> the<00:02:27.209> summer

00:02:27.440 --> 00:02:27.450 
fishing line through during the summer

00:02:27.450 --> 00:02:31.220 
fishing line through during the summer
is<00:02:27.690> to<00:02:27.870> fish<00:02:28.020> shallow<00:02:28.379> cover<00:02:29.060> now<00:02:30.110> when<00:02:31.110> I'm

00:02:31.220 --> 00:02:31.230 
is to fish shallow cover now when I'm

00:02:31.230 --> 00:02:33.559 
is to fish shallow cover now when I'm
deciding<00:02:31.530> between<00:02:31.800> a<00:02:32.069> wake<00:02:32.550> bait<00:02:32.849> and<00:02:33.150> a<00:02:33.239> line

00:02:33.559 --> 00:02:33.569 
deciding between a wake bait and a line

00:02:33.569 --> 00:02:36.229 
deciding between a wake bait and a line
through<00:02:33.980> the<00:02:34.980> choice<00:02:35.220> is<00:02:35.489> really<00:02:35.819> made<00:02:36.030> by

00:02:36.229 --> 00:02:36.239 
through the choice is really made by

00:02:36.239 --> 00:02:38.900 
through the choice is really made by
what<00:02:37.019> kind<00:02:37.260> of<00:02:37.379> cover<00:02:37.620> I'm<00:02:37.860> fishing<00:02:38.099> now

00:02:38.900 --> 00:02:38.910 
what kind of cover I'm fishing now

00:02:38.910 --> 00:02:42.229 
what kind of cover I'm fishing now
there's<00:02:39.510> a<00:02:39.629> few<00:02:39.989> kinds<00:02:40.349> of<00:02:40.440> cover<00:02:40.620> where<00:02:41.239> line

00:02:42.229 --> 00:02:42.239 
there's a few kinds of cover where line

00:02:42.239 --> 00:02:45.320 
there's a few kinds of cover where line
through<00:02:42.510> is<00:02:42.569> just<00:02:42.690> really<00:02:43.620> shine<00:02:44.010> and<00:02:44.430> are

00:02:45.320 --> 00:02:45.330 
through is just really shine and are

00:02:45.330 --> 00:02:48.430 
through is just really shine and are
going<00:02:45.480> to<00:02:45.540> do<00:02:45.629> a<00:02:45.660> lot<00:02:45.900> better<00:02:46.080> than<00:02:46.410> wait<00:02:46.890> Bates

00:02:48.430 --> 00:02:48.440 
going to do a lot better than wait Bates

00:02:48.440 --> 00:02:52.150 
going to do a lot better than wait Bates
one<00:02:49.440> is<00:02:49.680> going<00:02:49.830> to<00:02:49.890> be<00:02:50.269> deeper<00:02:51.269> weeds

00:02:52.150 --> 00:02:52.160 
one is going to be deeper weeds

00:02:52.160 --> 00:02:55.479 
one is going to be deeper weeds
traditional<00:02:53.160> really<00:02:53.550> heavy<00:02:53.760> weeds<00:02:54.110> that<00:02:55.110> are

00:02:55.479 --> 00:02:55.489 
traditional really heavy weeds that are

00:02:55.489 --> 00:02:59.479 
traditional really heavy weeds that are

throughs<00:02:59.819> are<00:02:59.970> great<00:03:00.300> choices<00:03:00.330> you<00:03:01.080> can<00:03:01.170> get

00:03:01.399 --> 00:03:01.409 
throughs are great choices you can get

00:03:01.409 --> 00:03:03.320 
throughs are great choices you can get
down<00:03:01.680> and<00:03:02.069> just<00:03:02.250> take<00:03:02.519> the<00:03:02.730> tops<00:03:02.970> of<00:03:03.150> those

through<00:04:07.349> that<00:04:07.439> stuff<00:04:07.920> and<00:04:08.780> we<00:04:09.780> can<00:04:09.959> really

00:04:10.490 --> 00:04:10.500 
through that stuff and we can really

00:04:10.500 --> 00:04:11.540 
through that stuff and we can really
pull<00:04:10.739> fish<00:04:11.010> out

00:04:11.540 --> 00:04:11.550 
pull fish out

00:04:13.310 --> 00:04:13.320 
another kind of cover that works really

00:04:13.320 --> 00:04:15.020 
another kind of cover that works really
well<00:04:13.500> throw<00:04:13.800> in<00:04:14.160> line<00:04:14.400> through<00:04:14.640> his<00:04:14.730> around

just inevitable that when you're fishing
around<00:04:19.590> dogs<00:04:19.890> eventually<00:04:20.670> you're<00:04:20.820> going<00:04:20.910> to

00:04:20.960 --> 00:04:20.970 
around dogs eventually you're going to

00:04:20.970 --> 00:04:23.750 
around dogs eventually you're going to
bounce<00:04:21.150> a<00:04:21.360> Luger<00:04:21.630> off<00:04:21.780> one<00:04:22.140> and<00:04:22.760> especially

00:04:25.730 --> 00:04:25.740 
when you're fishing at night it's just

00:04:25.740 --> 00:04:29.840

this kind of structure for one of two

00:05:01.230 --> 00:05:05.180 
this kind of structure for one of two
reasons<00:05:01.440> either<00:05:02.130> one<00:05:02.960> it<00:05:03.960> holds<00:05:04.200> bait<00:05:04.500> fish<00:05:04.830> it

00:05:05.180 --> 00:05:05.190 
reasons either one it holds bait fish it

00:05:05.190 --> 00:05:08.690 
reasons either one it holds bait fish it
it<00:05:06.090> provides<00:05:06.480> an<00:05:06.690> ambush<00:05:07.530> point<00:05:07.860> and<00:05:08.100> most

00:05:08.690 --> 00:05:08.700 
it provides an ambush point and most

00:05:08.700 --> 00:05:10.520 
it provides an ambush point and most
importantly<00:05:09.180> it<00:05:09.330> provides<00:05:09.420> shade<00:05:09.990> during<00:05:10.380> the

importantly it provides shade during the
heat<00:05:10.710> of<00:05:10.740> the<00:05:10.920> day<00:05:11.100> and<00:05:11.670> the<00:05:11.880> other<00:05:12.030> reason

00:05:12.380 --> 00:05:12.390 
heat of the day and the other reason

00:05:12.390 --> 00:05:14.270 
heat of the day and the other reason
they'll<00:05:12.540> be<00:05:12.660> there<00:05:12.870> is<00:05:13.140> it<00:05:13.500> holds<00:05:13.770> bait<00:05:13.950> fish

00:05:14.270 --> 00:05:14.280 
they'll be there is it holds bait fish

00:05:14.280 --> 00:05:17.630 
they'll be there is it holds bait fish
and<00:05:14.930> they're<00:05:15.930> moving<00:05:16.169> up<00:05:16.530> at<00:05:16.740> night<00:05:16.950> to<00:05:17.610> feed

00:05:17.630 --> 00:05:17.640
