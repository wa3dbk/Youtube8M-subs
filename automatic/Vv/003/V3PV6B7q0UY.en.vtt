00:00:35.270 --> 00:00:35.280 
investigation the silver market so they

00:00:35.280 --> 00:00:37.130 
investigation the silver market so they
really<00:00:35.460> didn't<00:00:35.730> sated<00:00:36.059> finding<00:00:36.450> manipulation

00:00:37.130 --> 00:00:37.140 
really didn't sated finding manipulation

00:00:38.450 --> 00:00:38.460 
what they're seeing is in front of the

00:00:38.460 --> 00:00:41.360 
what they're seeing is in front of the
proof<00:00:38.670> and<00:00:38.969> I<00:00:39.090> outline<00:00:39.840> that<00:00:40.110> and<00:00:40.469> talked

00:00:41.360 --> 00:00:41.370 
proof and I outline that and talked

00:00:41.370 --> 00:00:43.250 
proof and I outline that and talked
about<00:00:41.670> it<00:00:41.820> and<00:00:41.969> I<00:00:42.030> went<00:00:42.239> on<00:00:42.329> and<00:00:42.600> ranted<00:00:43.110> about

00:00:43.250 --> 00:00:43.260 
about it and I went on and ranted about

00:00:43.260 --> 00:00:46.130 
about it and I went on and ranted about
how<00:00:44.160> we<00:00:44.219> all<00:00:44.520> know<00:00:44.730> it's<00:00:45.149> manipulated<00:00:45.930> but

00:00:46.130 --> 00:00:46.140 
how we all know it's manipulated but

00:00:46.140 --> 00:00:48.860 
how we all know it's manipulated but
they<00:00:46.469> are<00:00:46.590> saying<00:00:46.829> they<00:00:47.039> can't<00:00:47.250> prove<00:00:47.550> it<00:00:47.870> we

00:00:48.860 --> 00:00:48.870 
they are saying they can't prove it we

00:00:48.870 --> 00:00:52.160 
they are saying they can't prove it we
talked<00:00:49.140> about<00:00:49.350> Fed<00:00:50.160> policy<00:00:50.870> and<00:00:51.870> what<00:00:52.020> this

00:00:52.160 --> 00:00:52.170 
talked about Fed policy and what this

00:00:52.170 --> 00:00:53.900 
talked about Fed policy and what this
non<00:00:52.410> taper<00:00:52.710> really<00:00:53.129> means<00:00:53.370> looked<00:00:53.670> at<00:00:53.820> the

00:00:53.900 --> 00:00:53.910 
non taper really means looked at the

00:00:53.910 --> 00:00:57.799 
non taper really means looked at the
Obamacare<00:00:54.629> situation<00:00:55.320> purely<00:00:55.829> from<00:00:56.129> a<00:00:56.809> cost

00:00:57.799 --> 00:00:57.809 
Obamacare situation purely from a cost

00:00:57.809 --> 00:00:59.840 
Obamacare situation purely from a cost
basis<00:00:58.440> if<00:00:58.590> it's<00:00:58.770> going<00:00:58.949> to<00:00:59.010> help<00:00:59.250> or<00:00:59.489> hurt<00:00:59.670> the

00:00:59.840 --> 00:00:59.850 
basis if it's going to help or hurt the

00:00:59.850 --> 00:01:03.170 
basis if it's going to help or hurt the
economy<00:01:00.559> not<00:01:01.559> so<00:01:01.800> much<00:01:01.980> as<00:01:02.190> the<00:01:02.399> political

00:01:03.170 --> 00:01:03.180 
economy not so much as the political

00:01:03.180 --> 00:01:05.359 
economy not so much as the political
side<00:01:03.449> of<00:01:03.660> it<00:01:03.780> then<00:01:04.470> I<00:01:04.500> went<00:01:04.860> on<00:01:05.010> and<00:01:05.250> went

00:01:05.359 --> 00:01:05.369 
side of it then I went on and went

00:01:05.369 --> 00:01:07.280 
side of it then I went on and went
through<00:01:05.670> a<00:01:05.729> commodity<00:01:06.299> supercycle<00:01:06.479> is<00:01:07.170> it

00:01:07.280 --> 00:01:07.290 
through a commodity supercycle is it

00:01:07.290 --> 00:01:09.500 
through a commodity supercycle is it
over<00:01:07.530> or<00:01:07.710> not<00:01:07.950> and<00:01:08.369> went<00:01:08.610> through<00:01:08.670> it<00:01:08.970> rather

00:01:09.500 --> 00:01:09.510 
over or not and went through it rather

00:01:09.510 --> 00:01:11.810 
over or not and went through it rather
carefully<00:01:10.140> and<00:01:10.290> made<00:01:10.470> a<00:01:10.500> strong<00:01:10.890> case<00:01:11.159> i<00:01:11.369> think

00:01:11.810 --> 00:01:11.820 
carefully and made a strong case i think

00:01:11.820 --> 00:01:14.390 
carefully and made a strong case i think
for<00:01:12.450> why<00:01:12.600> it's<00:01:12.810> still<00:01:12.900> intact<00:01:13.500> and<00:01:13.950> i<00:01:14.220> brought

00:01:14.390 --> 00:01:14.400 
for why it's still intact and i brought

00:01:14.400 --> 00:01:17.120 
for why it's still intact and i brought
up<00:01:14.549> these<00:01:14.670> two<00:01:14.880> charts<00:01:15.299> when<00:01:15.509> showing<00:01:16.130> crude

you can see by this chart from basically
the<00:01:26.570> 1900s<00:01:27.570> all<00:01:27.780> the<00:01:27.930> way<00:01:28.049> through<00:01:28.290> of<00:01:28.439> course

00:01:28.609 --> 00:01:28.619 
the 1900s all the way through of course

00:01:28.619 --> 00:01:30.590 
the 1900s all the way through of course
it's<00:01:28.799> shot<00:01:29.100> up<00:01:29.310> here<00:01:29.520> the<00:01:29.640> last<00:01:29.790> 10<00:01:30.090> years<00:01:30.270> we

00:01:30.590 --> 00:01:30.600 
it's shot up here the last 10 years we

00:01:30.600 --> 00:01:32.179 
it's shot up here the last 10 years we
all<00:01:30.780> know<00:01:30.990> and<00:01:31.229> it's<00:01:31.350> kind<00:01:31.560> of<00:01:31.650> going<00:01:31.799> sideways

00:01:32.179 --> 00:01:32.189 
all know and it's kind of going sideways

00:01:32.189 --> 00:01:34.190 
all know and it's kind of going sideways
the<00:01:32.490> last<00:01:32.670> couple<00:01:33.000> of<00:01:33.030> years<00:01:33.090> so<00:01:33.780> I<00:01:33.810> built<00:01:34.079> a

00:01:34.190 --> 00:01:34.200 
the last couple of years so I built a

00:01:34.200 --> 00:01:37.310 
the last couple of years so I built a
case<00:01:34.380> on<00:01:34.650> that<00:01:35.509> talking<00:01:36.509> about<00:01:36.600> China<00:01:37.110> of

00:01:37.310 --> 00:01:37.320 
case on that talking about China of

00:01:37.320 --> 00:01:39.530 
case on that talking about China of
course<00:01:37.400> then<00:01:38.400> I'm<00:01:38.700> going<00:01:38.880> to<00:01:38.970> skip<00:01:39.210> through<00:01:39.509> a

00:01:39.530 --> 00:01:39.540 
course then I'm going to skip through a

00:01:39.540 --> 00:01:41.030 
course then I'm going to skip through a
lot<00:01:39.810> of<00:01:39.960> this<00:01:40.110> because<00:01:40.439> we<00:01:40.560> had<00:01:40.740> another

00:01:41.030 --> 00:01:41.040 
lot of this because we had another

00:01:41.040 --> 00:01:43.100 
lot of this because we had another
recommendation<00:01:41.310> on<00:01:42.000> a<00:01:42.060> company<00:01:42.630> that<00:01:42.869> is

00:01:43.100 --> 00:01:43.110 
recommendation on a company that is

00:01:43.110 --> 00:01:46.010 
recommendation on a company that is
pretty<00:01:44.060> under<00:01:45.060> the<00:01:45.210> radar<00:01:45.540> we<00:01:45.720> think<00:01:45.899> it's

00:01:46.010 --> 00:01:46.020 
pretty under the radar we think it's

00:01:46.020 --> 00:01:47.870 
pretty under the radar we think it's
going<00:01:46.140> to<00:01:46.200> do<00:01:46.320> really<00:01:46.470> well<00:01:46.729> give<00:01:47.729> our

00:01:47.870 --> 00:01:47.880 
going to do really well give our

00:01:47.880 --> 00:01:51.590 
going to do really well give our

then<00:01:51.750> of<00:01:51.869> course<00:01:52.079> I<00:01:52.229> took<00:01:52.290> a<00:01:52.500> few<00:01:53.210> questions

00:01:54.200 --> 00:01:54.210

00:01:58.799 --> 00:02:00.469 
those even if the answers we can't

00:02:00.469 --> 00:02:00.479 
answer because sometimes get a specific

00:02:00.479 --> 00:02:02.240
