00:04:44.200 --> 00:04:44.210 
very very exciting to see how the

00:04:44.210 --> 00:04:46.440 
very very exciting to see how the
Europeans<00:04:44.930> perform<00:04:45.350> against<00:04:45.680> the<00:04:45.860> Americans

and<00:04:47.450> most<00:04:47.840> interestingly<00:04:48.500> i<00:04:49.220> think<00:04:49.550> is<00:04:49.760> how

00:04:50.020 --> 00:04:50.030 
and most interestingly i think is how

00:04:50.030 --> 00:04:53.350 
and most interestingly i think is how
