hello everyone this is mumbo here
welcome<00:00:06.870> back<00:00:07.049> and<00:00:07.230> today<00:00:07.500> we're<00:00:07.680> going<00:00:07.770> to<00:00:07.859> be

00:00:07.909 --> 00:00:07.919 
welcome back and today we're going to be

00:00:07.919 --> 00:00:09.980 
welcome back and today we're going to be
taking<00:00:08.280> a<00:00:08.340> look<00:00:08.460> at<00:00:08.670> some<00:00:09.030> pop<00:00:09.240> out<00:00:09.389> minecart

00:00:09.980 --> 00:00:09.990 
taking a look at some pop out minecart

00:00:09.990 --> 00:00:11.629 
taking a look at some pop out minecart
rails<00:00:10.230> but<00:00:10.500> that's<00:00:10.679> completely<00:00:11.160> besides<00:00:11.490> the

00:00:11.629 --> 00:00:11.639 
rails but that's completely besides the

00:00:11.639 --> 00:00:14.089 
rails but that's completely besides the
point<00:00:11.820> because<00:00:12.090> today<00:00:12.389> is<00:00:12.660> my<00:00:12.929> birthday<00:00:13.740> I<00:00:13.769> am

17 years of age today was born first the

00:00:17.190 --> 00:00:19.160 
17 years of age today was born first the
December<00:00:17.609> 1995<00:00:18.420> and<00:00:18.630> that's<00:00:18.779> really<00:00:19.020> exciting

00:00:19.160 --> 00:00:19.170 
December 1995 and that's really exciting

00:00:19.170 --> 00:00:22.279 
December 1995 and that's really exciting
because<00:00:19.590> now<00:00:20.039> I<00:00:20.369> am<00:00:20.699> legally<00:00:21.300> able<00:00:21.539> to<00:00:21.869> drive<00:00:22.109> I

00:00:22.279 --> 00:00:22.289 
because now I am legally able to drive I

00:00:22.289 --> 00:00:24.050 
because now I am legally able to drive I
don't<00:00:22.439> have<00:00:22.560> to<00:00:22.650> rely<00:00:22.800> on<00:00:23.010> people<00:00:23.550> anymore<00:00:23.760> to

00:00:24.050 --> 00:00:24.060 
don't have to rely on people anymore to

00:00:24.060 --> 00:00:26.450 
don't have to rely on people anymore to
give<00:00:24.180> me<00:00:24.300> lifts<00:00:24.689> which<00:00:25.140> is<00:00:25.289> just<00:00:25.529> fantastic<00:00:25.830> so

00:00:26.450 --> 00:00:26.460 
give me lifts which is just fantastic so

00:00:26.460 --> 00:00:28.009 
give me lifts which is just fantastic so
I'm<00:00:26.699> gonna<00:00:26.880> be<00:00:27.029> starting<00:00:27.359> my<00:00:27.420> driving<00:00:27.779> lesson

00:00:28.009 --> 00:00:28.019 
I'm gonna be starting my driving lesson

00:00:28.019 --> 00:00:30.620 
I'm gonna be starting my driving lesson
soon<00:00:28.230> but<00:00:29.010> that<00:00:29.340> is<00:00:29.550> also<00:00:29.880> completely

00:00:30.620 --> 00:00:30.630 
soon but that is also completely

00:00:30.630 --> 00:00:33.110 
soon but that is also completely
unrelated<00:00:31.080> to<00:00:31.439> this<00:00:31.529> video<00:00:31.830> so<00:00:32.099> yeah<00:00:32.309> today<00:00:32.759> we

00:00:33.110 --> 00:00:33.120 
unrelated to this video so yeah today we

00:00:33.120 --> 00:00:34.280 
unrelated to this video so yeah today we
are<00:00:33.210> going<00:00:33.300> to<00:00:33.390> be<00:00:33.480> making<00:00:33.630> some<00:00:33.989> pop<00:00:34.140> out

00:00:34.280 --> 00:00:34.290 
are going to be making some pop out

00:00:34.290 --> 00:00:36.170 
are going to be making some pop out
minecart<00:00:34.770> rails<00:00:35.010> I<00:00:35.280> really<00:00:35.820> like<00:00:35.969> the<00:00:36.149> idea

00:00:36.170 --> 00:00:36.180 
minecart rails I really like the idea

00:00:36.180 --> 00:00:37.880 
minecart rails I really like the idea
and<00:00:36.719> I<00:00:36.809> hope<00:00:37.079> you<00:00:37.320> do<00:00:37.469> too

00:00:37.880 --> 00:00:37.890 
and I hope you do too

00:00:37.890 --> 00:00:40.490 
and I hope you do too
so<00:00:38.760> what<00:00:38.969> we've<00:00:39.120> got<00:00:39.149> here<00:00:39.329> is<00:00:39.600> a<00:00:39.780> very<00:00:40.170> boring

00:00:40.490 --> 00:00:40.500 
so what we've got here is a very boring

00:00:40.500 --> 00:00:42.290 
so what we've got here is a very boring
tunnel<00:00:41.010> with<00:00:41.160> a<00:00:41.190> minecart<00:00:41.700> track<00:00:41.760> that<00:00:42.120> just

00:00:42.290 --> 00:00:42.300 
tunnel with a minecart track that just

00:00:42.300 --> 00:00:43.760 
tunnel with a minecart track that just
seems<00:00:42.450> to<00:00:42.540> end<00:00:42.690> it<00:00:42.899> doesn't<00:00:43.170> go<00:00:43.290> anywhere<00:00:43.500> it's

00:00:43.760 --> 00:00:43.770 
seems to end it doesn't go anywhere it's

00:00:43.770 --> 00:00:45.680 
seems to end it doesn't go anywhere it's
got<00:00:43.890> no<00:00:44.100> destination<00:00:44.340> what<00:00:45.059> is<00:00:45.180> the<00:00:45.300> point<00:00:45.480> in

00:00:45.680 --> 00:00:45.690 
got no destination what is the point in

00:00:45.690 --> 00:00:47.330 
got no destination what is the point in
that<00:00:45.719> well<00:00:46.469> that's<00:00:46.800> all<00:00:47.010> about<00:00:47.039> to<00:00:47.219> change

00:00:47.330 --> 00:00:47.340 
that well that's all about to change

00:00:47.340 --> 00:00:49.520 
that well that's all about to change
when<00:00:47.760> we<00:00:47.789> place<00:00:48.090> down<00:00:48.270> our<00:00:48.450> mine<00:00:48.629> car<00:00:48.899> sit<00:00:49.410> in

00:00:49.520 --> 00:00:49.530 
when we place down our mine car sit in

00:00:49.530 --> 00:00:51.170 
when we place down our mine car sit in
it<00:00:49.649> and<00:00:49.800> hit<00:00:50.039> this<00:00:50.190> button<00:00:50.430> not<00:00:50.760> only<00:00:50.969> do<00:00:51.090> we

00:00:51.170 --> 00:00:51.180 
it and hit this button not only do we

00:00:51.180 --> 00:00:53.209 
it and hit this button not only do we
get<00:00:51.329> propelled<00:00:51.719> forwards<00:00:52.199> but<00:00:52.559> also<00:00:52.800> our

00:00:53.209 --> 00:00:53.219 
get propelled forwards but also our

00:00:53.219 --> 00:00:54.950 
get propelled forwards but also our
minecart<00:00:53.760> track<00:00:53.850> pops<00:00:54.329> out<00:00:54.539> of<00:00:54.570> the<00:00:54.780> wall

00:00:54.950 --> 00:00:54.960 
minecart track pops out of the wall

00:00:54.960 --> 00:00:56.810 
minecart track pops out of the wall
ready<00:00:55.530> for<00:00:55.800> you<00:00:55.920> so<00:00:56.100> we<00:00:56.190> can<00:00:56.280> get<00:00:56.489> to<00:00:56.579> the<00:00:56.670> end

00:00:56.810 --> 00:00:56.820 
ready for you so we can get to the end

00:00:56.820 --> 00:00:58.790 
ready for you so we can get to the end
of<00:00:57.000> the<00:00:57.120> tunnel<00:00:57.300> success<00:00:57.989> and<00:00:58.469> then<00:00:58.559> we<00:00:58.649> can

00:00:58.790 --> 00:00:58.800 
of the tunnel success and then we can

00:00:58.800 --> 00:01:00.200 
of the tunnel success and then we can
head<00:00:58.949> back<00:00:59.160> because<00:00:59.550> the<00:00:59.699> other<00:00:59.820> sides<00:01:00.090> are

00:01:00.200 --> 00:01:00.210 
head back because the other sides are

00:01:00.210 --> 00:01:02.060 
head back because the other sides are
just<00:01:00.359> a<00:01:00.449> lot<00:01:00.539> more<00:01:00.600> homely<00:01:01.079> then<00:01:01.530> we<00:01:01.620> can<00:01:01.770> pop

00:01:02.060 --> 00:01:02.070 
just a lot more homely then we can pop

00:01:02.070 --> 00:01:03.920 
just a lot more homely then we can pop
out<00:01:02.219> of<00:01:02.340> our<00:01:02.460> mind<00:01:02.670> car<00:01:02.940> and<00:01:03.149> press<00:01:03.780> this

00:01:03.920 --> 00:01:03.930 
out of our mind car and press this

00:01:03.930 --> 00:01:05.840 
out of our mind car and press this
button<00:01:04.140> again<00:01:04.439> and<00:01:04.589> all<00:01:05.129> of<00:01:05.250> our<00:01:05.369> tracks<00:01:05.640> will

00:01:05.840 --> 00:01:05.850 
button again and all of our tracks will

00:01:05.850 --> 00:01:08.289 
button again and all of our tracks will
get<00:01:05.970> retracted<00:01:06.479> back<00:01:06.659> into<00:01:07.110> the<00:01:07.229> wall<00:01:07.439> perfect

00:01:08.289 --> 00:01:08.299 
get retracted back into the wall perfect

00:01:08.299 --> 00:01:10.850 
get retracted back into the wall perfect
this<00:01:09.299> design<00:01:09.689> uses<00:01:09.990> pretty<00:01:10.350> much<00:01:10.560> the<00:01:10.710> same

00:01:10.850 --> 00:01:10.860 
this design uses pretty much the same

00:01:10.860 --> 00:01:12.710 
this design uses pretty much the same
concept<00:01:11.369> as<00:01:11.460> some<00:01:11.670> of<00:01:11.760> my<00:01:11.880> more<00:01:12.060> recent<00:01:12.570> videos

00:01:12.710 --> 00:01:12.720 
concept as some of my more recent videos

00:01:12.720 --> 00:01:14.420 
concept as some of my more recent videos
it<00:01:13.049> has<00:01:13.080> a<00:01:13.229> circuit<00:01:13.770> that<00:01:13.890> does<00:01:14.040> all<00:01:14.189> of<00:01:14.220> the

00:01:14.420 --> 00:01:14.430 
it has a circuit that does all of the

00:01:14.430 --> 00:01:16.100 
it has a circuit that does all of the
work<00:01:14.460> such<00:01:14.939> as<00:01:14.970> the<00:01:15.180> piston<00:01:15.540> timings<00:01:15.960> and

00:01:16.100 --> 00:01:16.110 
work such as the piston timings and

00:01:16.110 --> 00:01:17.810 
work such as the piston timings and
things<00:01:16.320> like<00:01:16.439> that<00:01:16.500> and<00:01:16.920> then<00:01:17.250> it<00:01:17.340> just<00:01:17.549> sends

00:01:17.810 --> 00:01:17.820 
things like that and then it just sends

00:01:17.820 --> 00:01:19.550 
things like that and then it just sends
the<00:01:17.909> outputs<00:01:18.390> down<00:01:18.570> long<00:01:18.900> lines<00:01:19.110> of<00:01:19.259> redstone

00:01:19.550 --> 00:01:19.560 
the outputs down long lines of redstone

00:01:19.560 --> 00:01:20.960 
the outputs down long lines of redstone
that<00:01:19.860> connect<00:01:20.159> to<00:01:20.189> the<00:01:20.280> corresponding

00:01:20.960 --> 00:01:20.970 
that connect to the corresponding

00:01:20.970 --> 00:01:23.270 
that connect to the corresponding
Pistons<00:01:21.420> so<00:01:21.930> with<00:01:22.080> all<00:01:22.229> of<00:01:22.259> that<00:01:22.380> said<00:01:22.799> let's

00:01:23.270 --> 00:01:23.280 
Pistons so with all of that said let's

00:01:23.280 --> 00:01:24.950 
Pistons so with all of that said let's
take<00:01:23.520> a<00:01:23.549> look<00:01:23.820> at<00:01:23.970> the<00:01:24.150> Redstone<00:01:24.570> behind<00:01:24.869> this

00:01:24.950 --> 00:01:24.960 
take a look at the Redstone behind this

00:01:24.960 --> 00:01:27.950 
take a look at the Redstone behind this
thing<00:01:25.400> so<00:01:26.400> this<00:01:26.700> part<00:01:26.970> here<00:01:27.150> is<00:01:27.330> our<00:01:27.479> circuit

00:01:27.950 --> 00:01:27.960 
thing so this part here is our circuit

00:01:27.960 --> 00:01:29.960 
thing so this part here is our circuit
the<00:01:28.110> most<00:01:28.380> important<00:01:28.979> part<00:01:29.250> as<00:01:29.460> I<00:01:29.579> discussed

00:01:29.960 --> 00:01:29.970 
the most important part as I discussed

00:01:29.970 --> 00:01:31.580 
the most important part as I discussed
earlier<00:01:30.119> it<00:01:30.509> does<00:01:30.659> all<00:01:30.780> of<00:01:30.810> the<00:01:30.990> timings<00:01:31.439> and

00:01:31.580 --> 00:01:31.590 
earlier it does all of the timings and

00:01:31.590 --> 00:01:33.499 
earlier it does all of the timings and
the<00:01:31.920> Pistons<00:01:32.340> and<00:01:32.460> things<00:01:32.729> like<00:01:32.850> that<00:01:32.909> then

00:01:33.499 --> 00:01:33.509 
the Pistons and things like that then

00:01:33.509 --> 00:01:35.600 
the Pistons and things like that then
these<00:01:33.810> lines<00:01:34.170> of<00:01:34.409> redstone<00:01:34.920> here<00:01:34.950> are<00:01:35.369> just

00:01:35.600 --> 00:01:35.610 
these lines of redstone here are just

00:01:35.610 --> 00:01:37.010 
these lines of redstone here are just
the<00:01:35.700> carryout<00:01:36.030> lines<00:01:36.360> they<00:01:36.630> take<00:01:36.900> the

00:01:37.010 --> 00:01:37.020 
the carryout lines they take the

00:01:37.020 --> 00:01:39.170 
the carryout lines they take the
redstone<00:01:37.439> signals<00:01:37.829> to<00:01:38.280> the<00:01:38.430> correct<00:01:38.729> Pistons

00:01:39.170 --> 00:01:39.180 
redstone signals to the correct Pistons

00:01:39.180 --> 00:01:42.080 
redstone signals to the correct Pistons
all<00:01:39.509> very<00:01:40.320> simple<00:01:40.829> and<00:01:40.979> easy<00:01:41.100> so<00:01:41.520> without

further ado let's crack on with this

00:01:43.799 --> 00:01:46.370 
further ado let's crack on with this
tutorial<00:01:44.630> so<00:01:45.630> you<00:01:45.720> want<00:01:45.869> to<00:01:45.930> kick<00:01:46.079> things<00:01:46.290> off

00:01:46.370 --> 00:01:46.380 
tutorial so you want to kick things off

00:01:46.380 --> 00:01:48.469 
tutorial so you want to kick things off
by<00:01:46.560> placing<00:01:46.740> a<00:01:46.950> block<00:01:47.100> up<00:01:47.340> like<00:01:47.490> this<00:01:47.759> block<00:01:48.299> on

00:01:48.469 --> 00:01:48.479 
by placing a block up like this block on

00:01:48.479 --> 00:01:50.480 
by placing a block up like this block on
the<00:01:48.600> side<00:01:48.630> with<00:01:49.049> a<00:01:49.079> repeater<00:01:49.560> there<00:01:49.950> then<00:01:50.369> a

00:01:50.480 --> 00:01:50.490 
the side with a repeater there then a

00:01:50.490 --> 00:01:51.980 
the side with a repeater there then a
sticky<00:01:50.880> piston<00:01:51.060> facing<00:01:51.509> upwards<00:01:51.840> with<00:01:51.960> a

00:01:57.230 --> 00:01:57.240 
circuit block like that repeater and

00:01:57.240 --> 00:02:01.520 
circuit block like that repeater and
then<00:01:58.110> another<00:01:58.799> block<00:01:59.130> here<00:01:59.460> with<00:02:00.530> redstone

00:02:01.520 --> 00:02:01.530 
then another block here with redstone

00:02:01.530 --> 00:02:03.649 
then another block here with redstone
dust<00:02:01.770> there<00:02:02.310> and<00:02:02.549> then<00:02:02.939> on<00:02:03.119> this<00:02:03.240> side<00:02:03.299> you

00:02:03.649 --> 00:02:03.659 
dust there and then on this side you

00:02:03.659 --> 00:02:04.819 
dust there and then on this side you
just<00:02:03.689> want<00:02:03.840> to<00:02:04.020> take<00:02:04.170> the<00:02:04.290> blocks<00:02:04.530> out<00:02:04.680> like

00:02:04.819 --> 00:02:04.829 
just want to take the blocks out like

00:02:04.829 --> 00:02:06.709 
just want to take the blocks out like
this<00:02:04.979> block<00:02:05.490> out<00:02:05.670> like<00:02:05.850> that<00:02:06.030> and<00:02:06.210> then<00:02:06.509> just

00:02:06.709 --> 00:02:06.719 
this block out like that and then just

00:02:06.719 --> 00:02:07.999 
this block out like that and then just
run<00:02:06.899> a<00:02:06.930> line<00:02:07.229> of<00:02:07.380> blocks<00:02:07.530> along<00:02:07.799> like<00:02:07.979> that

00:02:07.999 --> 00:02:08.009 
run a line of blocks along like that

00:02:08.009 --> 00:02:10.729 
run a line of blocks along like that
with<00:02:08.640> one<00:02:08.910> there<00:02:09.149> as<00:02:09.330> well<00:02:09.629> then<00:02:10.140> all<00:02:10.440> of<00:02:10.470> these

00:02:10.729 --> 00:02:10.739 
with one there as well then all of these

00:02:10.739 --> 00:02:12.619 
with one there as well then all of these
repeaters<00:02:11.129> from<00:02:11.520> now<00:02:11.670> on<00:02:11.910> need<00:02:12.120> to<00:02:12.209> be<00:02:12.300> on<00:02:12.390> four

00:02:12.619 --> 00:02:12.629 
repeaters from now on need to be on four

00:02:12.629 --> 00:02:13.640 
repeaters from now on need to be on four
ticks<00:02:12.930> so

00:02:13.640 --> 00:02:13.650 
ticks so

00:02:13.650 --> 00:02:16.190 
ticks so
one<00:02:13.860> all<00:02:14.459> of<00:02:14.519> these<00:02:14.849> for<00:02:15.510> ticks<00:02:15.750> so<00:02:15.959> there<00:02:16.110> we

00:02:16.190 --> 00:02:16.200 
one all of these for ticks so there we

00:02:16.200 --> 00:02:18.140 
one all of these for ticks so there we
go<00:02:16.319> your<00:02:16.530> pink<00:02:16.769> circuit<00:02:17.159> is<00:02:17.250> done<00:02:17.459> how<00:02:17.730> simple

00:02:18.140 --> 00:02:18.150 
go your pink circuit is done how simple

00:02:18.150 --> 00:02:18.679 
go your pink circuit is done how simple
was<00:02:18.269> that

00:02:18.679 --> 00:02:18.689 
was that

00:02:18.689 --> 00:02:20.929 
was that
so<00:02:19.620> now<00:02:19.739> we're<00:02:19.829> gonna<00:02:19.920> do<00:02:20.159> our<00:02:20.370> double<00:02:20.519> piston

00:02:20.929 --> 00:02:20.939 
so now we're gonna do our double piston

00:02:20.939 --> 00:02:22.250 
so now we're gonna do our double piston
extender<00:02:21.269> circuits<00:02:21.720> you<00:02:21.840> want<00:02:21.959> to<00:02:22.019> play<00:02:22.110> some

redstone<00:02:22.439> here<00:02:22.680> a<00:02:23.099> block<00:02:23.640> on<00:02:23.819> the<00:02:23.849> side<00:02:23.970> of

00:02:24.170 --> 00:02:24.180 
redstone here a block on the side of

00:02:24.180 --> 00:02:26.750 
redstone here a block on the side of
that<00:02:24.540> like<00:02:24.810> so<00:02:25.319> and<00:02:25.530> then<00:02:26.010> some<00:02:26.250> redstone<00:02:26.610> dust

00:02:26.750 --> 00:02:26.760 
that like so and then some redstone dust

00:02:26.760 --> 00:02:29.270 
that like so and then some redstone dust
on<00:02:26.939> the<00:02:27.090> top<00:02:27.120> two<00:02:27.840> pieces<00:02:28.230> of<00:02:28.260> glowstone<00:02:28.980> or

00:02:29.270 --> 00:02:29.280 
on the top two pieces of glowstone or

00:02:29.280 --> 00:02:31.160 
on the top two pieces of glowstone or
half<00:02:29.519> slab<00:02:29.849> I<00:02:30.060> just<00:02:30.329> use<00:02:30.540> glowstone<00:02:30.959> because

00:02:31.160 --> 00:02:31.170 
half slab I just use glowstone because

00:02:31.170 --> 00:02:32.869 
half slab I just use glowstone because
it<00:02:31.290> looks<00:02:31.500> nicer<00:02:31.920> and<00:02:32.370> you<00:02:32.430> want<00:02:32.549> to<00:02:32.609> place<00:02:32.730> a

00:02:32.869 --> 00:02:32.879 
it looks nicer and you want to place a

00:02:32.879 --> 00:02:35.000 
it looks nicer and you want to place a
block<00:02:33.060> like<00:02:33.269> this<00:02:33.510> redstone<00:02:34.290> torch<00:02:34.680> on<00:02:34.890> it

00:02:35.000 --> 00:02:35.010 
block like this redstone torch on it

00:02:35.010 --> 00:02:36.860 
block like this redstone torch on it
like<00:02:35.159> so<00:02:35.430> and<00:02:35.670> then<00:02:35.879> just<00:02:35.970> go<00:02:36.239> two<00:02:36.510> blocks<00:02:36.780> down

00:02:36.860 --> 00:02:36.870 
like so and then just go two blocks down

00:02:36.870 --> 00:02:39.229 
like so and then just go two blocks down
and<00:02:37.290> place<00:02:37.920> some<00:02:38.099> redstone<00:02:38.340> dust<00:02:38.819> on<00:02:39.060> the<00:02:39.209> top

00:02:39.229 --> 00:02:39.239

00:02:39.239 --> 00:02:41.330 
and place some redstone dust on the top
and<00:02:39.689> then<00:02:40.260> hit<00:02:40.500> around<00:02:40.590> here<00:02:40.769> place<00:02:41.159> two

00:02:41.330 --> 00:02:41.340 
and then hit around here place two

00:02:41.340 --> 00:02:44.420 
and then hit around here place two
blocks<00:02:41.599> redstone<00:02:42.599> dust<00:02:42.840> repeater<00:02:43.650> and<00:02:44.099> then<00:02:44.400> a

00:02:44.420 --> 00:02:44.430 
blocks redstone dust repeater and then a

00:02:44.430 --> 00:02:46.099 
blocks redstone dust repeater and then a
sticky<00:02:44.939> piston<00:02:45.239> on<00:02:45.359> the<00:02:45.420> side<00:02:45.599> of<00:02:45.629> that<00:02:45.810> block

00:02:46.099 --> 00:02:46.109 
sticky piston on the side of that block

00:02:46.109 --> 00:02:47.960 
sticky piston on the side of that block
and<00:02:46.319> a<00:02:46.709> block<00:02:46.950> there<00:02:47.220> with<00:02:47.459> a<00:02:47.489> repeater

00:02:47.960 --> 00:02:47.970 
and a block there with a repeater

00:02:47.970 --> 00:02:49.460 
and a block there with a repeater
heading<00:02:48.329> out<00:02:48.510> of<00:02:48.720> it<00:02:48.840> and<00:02:48.989> then<00:02:49.109> on<00:02:49.230> this<00:02:49.409> side

00:02:49.460 --> 00:02:49.470 
heading out of it and then on this side

00:02:49.470 --> 00:02:51.289 
heading out of it and then on this side
when<00:02:50.190> I<00:02:50.220> place<00:02:50.459> a<00:02:50.489> sticky<00:02:50.909> piston<00:02:51.209> facing

00:02:51.289 --> 00:02:51.299 
when I place a sticky piston facing

00:02:51.299 --> 00:02:53.569 
when I place a sticky piston facing
upwards<00:02:51.840> that<00:02:51.959> will<00:02:52.109> extend<00:02:52.409> block<00:02:53.069> and<00:02:53.370> then

00:02:53.569 --> 00:02:53.579 
upwards that will extend block and then

00:02:53.579 --> 00:02:55.640 
upwards that will extend block and then
another<00:02:54.030> repeater<00:02:54.420> heading<00:02:54.720> out<00:02:54.840> of<00:02:54.870> it<00:02:55.109> with

00:02:55.640 --> 00:02:55.650 
another repeater heading out of it with

00:02:55.650 --> 00:02:58.460 
another repeater heading out of it with
some<00:02:56.310> blocks<00:02:56.519> like<00:02:56.760> this<00:02:56.970> and<00:02:57.290> redstone<00:02:58.290> on

00:02:58.460 --> 00:02:58.470 
some blocks like this and redstone on

00:02:58.470 --> 00:03:00.110 
some blocks like this and redstone on
the<00:02:58.590> top<00:02:58.829> so<00:02:59.010> what<00:02:59.189> you<00:02:59.310> have<00:02:59.459> created<00:02:59.609> there

00:03:00.110 --> 00:03:00.120 
the top so what you have created there

00:03:00.120 --> 00:03:03.020 
the top so what you have created there
is<00:03:00.150> a<00:03:00.359> dual<00:03:00.720> ledge<00:03:00.900> monostable<00:03:01.439> circuit<00:03:02.040> so

00:03:03.020 --> 00:03:03.030 
is a dual ledge monostable circuit so

00:03:03.030 --> 00:03:04.490 
is a dual ledge monostable circuit so
we're<00:03:03.239> almost<00:03:03.480> done<00:03:03.750> with<00:03:03.959> our<00:03:04.079> circuit

00:03:04.490 --> 00:03:04.500 
we're almost done with our circuit

00:03:04.500 --> 00:03:05.780 
we're almost done with our circuit
there's<00:03:04.650> just<00:03:04.829> one<00:03:05.040> last<00:03:05.189> thing<00:03:05.459> we've<00:03:05.579> got<00:03:05.760> to

00:03:05.780 --> 00:03:05.790 
there's just one last thing we've got to

00:03:05.790 --> 00:03:07.309 
there's just one last thing we've got to
do<00:03:06.000> you<00:03:06.120> just<00:03:06.299> want<00:03:06.450> to<00:03:06.480> carry<00:03:06.780> out<00:03:06.930> this<00:03:07.109> line

00:03:07.309 --> 00:03:07.319 
do you just want to carry out this line

00:03:07.319 --> 00:03:08.839 
do you just want to carry out this line
of<00:03:07.439> redstone<00:03:07.620> like<00:03:07.920> this<00:03:08.099> and<00:03:08.310> place<00:03:08.819> a

00:03:08.839 --> 00:03:08.849 
of redstone like this and place a

00:03:08.849 --> 00:03:10.819 
of redstone like this and place a
repeater<00:03:09.299> there<00:03:09.689> and<00:03:09.930> then<00:03:10.260> just<00:03:10.290> carry<00:03:10.680> out

00:03:10.819 --> 00:03:10.829 
repeater there and then just carry out

00:03:10.829 --> 00:03:13.009 
repeater there and then just carry out
this<00:03:11.040> one<00:03:11.370> all<00:03:11.760> the<00:03:11.819> way<00:03:12.030> to<00:03:12.120> the<00:03:12.420> end<00:03:12.599> and

00:03:13.009 --> 00:03:13.019 
this one all the way to the end and

00:03:13.019 --> 00:03:15.500 
this one all the way to the end and
place<00:03:13.560> your<00:03:13.739> redstone<00:03:13.950> and<00:03:14.549> then<00:03:14.939> a<00:03:14.970> repeater

00:03:15.500 --> 00:03:15.510 
place your redstone and then a repeater

00:03:15.510 --> 00:03:17.059 
place your redstone and then a repeater
like<00:03:15.750> that<00:03:15.959> now<00:03:16.439> the<00:03:16.500> reason<00:03:16.889> we're<00:03:17.040> doing

00:03:17.059 --> 00:03:17.069 
like that now the reason we're doing

00:03:17.069 --> 00:03:18.589 
like that now the reason we're doing
this<00:03:17.430> is<00:03:17.639> so<00:03:17.819> that<00:03:17.849> you<00:03:17.970> can<00:03:18.120> get<00:03:18.269> the<00:03:18.359> maximum

00:03:18.589 --> 00:03:18.599 
this is so that you can get the maximum

00:03:18.599 --> 00:03:21.099 
this is so that you can get the maximum
length<00:03:19.139> and<00:03:19.379> pop<00:03:19.650> out<00:03:19.799> minecart<00:03:20.400> rails

00:03:21.099 --> 00:03:21.109 
length and pop out minecart rails

00:03:21.109 --> 00:03:24.470 
length and pop out minecart rails
possible<00:03:22.250> all<00:03:23.250> that's<00:03:23.609> left<00:03:23.790> to<00:03:23.879> do<00:03:24.030> now<00:03:24.060> is

00:03:24.470 --> 00:03:24.480 
possible all that's left to do now is

00:03:24.480 --> 00:03:26.420 
possible all that's left to do now is
your<00:03:24.660> bus<00:03:24.840> line<00:03:25.139> so<00:03:25.470> I'm<00:03:25.859> just<00:03:26.069> going<00:03:26.220> to<00:03:26.310> do

00:03:26.420 --> 00:03:26.430 
your bus line so I'm just going to do

00:03:26.430 --> 00:03:28.009 
your bus line so I'm just going to do
mine<00:03:26.609> fall<00:03:26.970> along<00:03:27.150> like<00:03:27.359> this<00:03:27.569> you<00:03:27.810> just<00:03:27.930> want

00:03:28.009 --> 00:03:28.019 
mine fall along like this you just want

00:03:28.019 --> 00:03:29.629 
mine fall along like this you just want
to<00:03:28.169> place<00:03:28.319> redstone<00:03:28.590> across<00:03:29.069> the<00:03:29.220> top<00:03:29.370> of<00:03:29.489> here

00:03:29.629 --> 00:03:29.639 
to place redstone across the top of here

00:03:29.639 --> 00:03:31.339 
to place redstone across the top of here
and<00:03:29.849> then<00:03:30.239> for<00:03:30.480> this<00:03:30.599> one<00:03:30.810> we<00:03:30.930> need<00:03:30.959> fence

00:03:31.339 --> 00:03:31.349 
and then for this one we need fence

00:03:31.349 --> 00:03:33.110 
and then for this one we need fence
gates<00:03:31.680> on<00:03:31.949> this<00:03:32.190> side<00:03:32.430> so<00:03:32.699> you<00:03:32.790> just<00:03:32.909> want<00:03:33.060> to

00:03:33.110 --> 00:03:33.120 
gates on this side so you just want to

00:03:33.120 --> 00:03:35.000 
gates on this side so you just want to
carry<00:03:33.329> that<00:03:33.449> out<00:03:33.510> like<00:03:33.780> this<00:03:33.959> and<00:03:34.230> then<00:03:34.739> place

00:03:35.000 --> 00:03:35.010 
carry that out like this and then place

00:03:35.010 --> 00:03:36.470 
carry that out like this and then place
your<00:03:35.159> fence<00:03:35.400> gates<00:03:35.699> like<00:03:35.849> that<00:03:36.090> it<00:03:36.209> doesn't

00:03:36.470 --> 00:03:36.480 
your fence gates like that it doesn't

00:03:36.480 --> 00:03:38.210 
your fence gates like that it doesn't
matter<00:03:36.690> what<00:03:37.049> direction<00:03:37.260> they're<00:03:37.709> facing<00:03:38.099> or

blocks along like this and your redstone

00:03:43.139 --> 00:03:45.319 
blocks along like this and your redstone
across<00:03:43.650> the<00:03:43.799> top<00:03:44.040> and<00:03:44.250> then<00:03:44.639> you<00:03:44.760> can<00:03:44.879> add<00:03:45.090> in

00:03:45.319 --> 00:03:45.329 
across the top and then you can add in

00:03:45.329 --> 00:03:46.909 
across the top and then you can add in
your<00:03:45.359> double<00:03:45.780> piston<00:03:45.900> extender<00:03:46.319> so<00:03:46.470> like<00:03:46.769> that

all<00:03:47.549> the<00:03:47.819> way<00:03:47.909> along<00:03:48.209> and<00:03:48.449> then<00:03:48.930> down<00:03:49.199> here<00:03:49.530> you

00:03:49.699 --> 00:03:49.709 
all the way along and then down here you

00:03:49.709 --> 00:03:51.289 
all the way along and then down here you
just<00:03:49.739> want<00:03:49.979> to<00:03:50.190> carry<00:03:50.459> out<00:03:50.639> this<00:03:50.970> line<00:03:51.150> of

00:03:51.289 --> 00:03:51.299 
just want to carry out this line of

00:03:51.299 --> 00:03:53.809 
just want to carry out this line of
redstone<00:03:51.569> here<00:03:52.190> for<00:03:53.190> the<00:03:53.280> lengths<00:03:53.609> of<00:03:53.760> your

00:03:53.809 --> 00:03:53.819 
redstone here for the lengths of your

00:03:53.819 --> 00:03:56.270 
redstone here for the lengths of your
pop<00:03:54.120> out<00:03:54.299> rails<00:03:54.540> and<00:03:54.900> then<00:03:55.560> this<00:03:55.949> line<00:03:56.129> of

00:03:56.270 --> 00:03:56.280 
pop out rails and then this line of

00:03:56.280 --> 00:04:00.020 
pop out rails and then this line of
blocks<00:03:56.489> we're<00:03:57.449> putting<00:03:58.079> repeaters<00:03:58.879> along<00:03:59.879> it

00:04:00.020 --> 00:04:00.030 
blocks we're putting repeaters along it

00:04:00.030 --> 00:04:01.550 
blocks we're putting repeaters along it
like<00:04:00.180> that<00:04:00.419> and<00:04:00.659> then<00:04:00.840> place<00:04:01.079> your<00:04:01.290> sticky

00:04:01.550 --> 00:04:01.560 
like that and then place your sticky

00:04:01.560 --> 00:04:06.110 
like that and then place your sticky
pistons<00:04:01.919> facing<00:04:02.099> upwards<00:04:02.699> along<00:04:02.879> here<00:04:05.090> now<00:04:06.090> I

00:04:06.110 --> 00:04:06.120 
pistons facing upwards along here now I

00:04:06.120 --> 00:04:07.729 
pistons facing upwards along here now I
just<00:04:06.239> want<00:04:06.569> to<00:04:06.629> apologize<00:04:06.840> because<00:04:07.169> I<00:04:07.440> have

00:04:07.729 --> 00:04:07.739 
just want to apologize because I have

00:04:07.739 --> 00:04:09.619 
just want to apologize because I have
made<00:04:07.979> a<00:04:08.010> few<00:04:08.400> minor<00:04:08.699> errors<00:04:09.120> in<00:04:09.299> this<00:04:09.479> tutorial

00:04:09.619 --> 00:04:09.629 
made a few minor errors in this tutorial

00:04:09.629 --> 00:04:11.899 
made a few minor errors in this tutorial
so<00:04:10.379> let's<00:04:10.409> crack<00:04:10.739> on<00:04:10.799> with<00:04:11.099> those<00:04:11.250> you<00:04:11.699> want<00:04:11.790> to

00:04:11.899 --> 00:04:11.909 
so let's crack on with those you want to

00:04:11.909 --> 00:04:14.270 
so let's crack on with those you want to
set<00:04:12.120> this<00:04:12.269> repeater<00:04:12.659> up<00:04:12.930> here<00:04:13.229> to<00:04:13.680> two<00:04:13.949> ticks

00:04:14.270 --> 00:04:14.280 
set this repeater up here to two ticks

00:04:14.280 --> 00:04:16.909 
set this repeater up here to two ticks
and<00:04:14.489> then<00:04:14.819> go<00:04:15.000> down<00:04:15.180> here<00:04:15.569> and<00:04:15.780> place<00:04:16.139> a<00:04:16.349> sticky

00:04:16.909 --> 00:04:16.919 
and then go down here and place a sticky

00:04:16.919 --> 00:04:18.800 
and then go down here and place a sticky
piston<00:04:17.070> facing<00:04:17.579> upwards<00:04:18.030> with<00:04:18.449> a<00:04:18.479> block<00:04:18.780> on

00:04:18.800 --> 00:04:18.810 
piston facing upwards with a block on

00:04:18.810 --> 00:04:20.750 
piston facing upwards with a block on
top<00:04:19.079> there<00:04:19.320> to<00:04:19.500> form<00:04:19.709> a<00:04:19.829> monostable<00:04:20.099> circuit

00:04:20.750 --> 00:04:20.760 
top there to form a monostable circuit

00:04:20.760 --> 00:04:23.029 
top there to form a monostable circuit
then<00:04:21.090> set<00:04:21.389> this<00:04:21.570> repeater<00:04:21.959> here<00:04:22.200> to<00:04:22.409> one<00:04:22.710> tick

00:04:23.029 --> 00:04:23.039 
then set this repeater here to one tick

00:04:23.039 --> 00:04:25.760 
then set this repeater here to one tick
now<00:04:23.729> if<00:04:24.000> we<00:04:24.150> place<00:04:24.360> our<00:04:24.599> minecart<00:04:25.139> rails<00:04:25.440> our

00:04:25.760 --> 00:04:25.770 
now if we place our minecart rails our

00:04:25.770 --> 00:04:26.310 
now if we place our minecart rails our
long<00:04:25.979> ride

00:04:26.310 --> 00:04:26.320 
long ride

00:04:26.320 --> 00:04:28.560 
long ride
this<00:04:26.440> this<00:04:26.980> should<00:04:27.310> potentially<00:04:27.730> work<00:04:28.210> so

00:04:28.560 --> 00:04:28.570 
this this should potentially work so

00:04:28.570 --> 00:04:32.310 
this this should potentially work so
here<00:04:29.080> are<00:04:29.230> bun<00:04:29.470> and<00:04:30.750> there<00:04:31.750> we<00:04:31.840> go<00:04:32.020> they<00:04:32.200> get

00:04:32.310 --> 00:04:32.320 
here are bun and there we go they get

00:04:32.320 --> 00:04:34.380 
here are bun and there we go they get
retracted<00:04:32.830> then<00:04:33.220> these<00:04:33.370> get<00:04:33.640> forced<00:04:33.970> upwards

00:04:34.380 --> 00:04:34.390 
retracted then these get forced upwards

00:04:34.390 --> 00:04:40.590 
retracted then these get forced upwards
and<00:04:34.570> let's<00:04:34.750> see<00:04:34.960> the<00:04:35.170> extension<00:04:38.160> perfect<00:04:39.600> so

00:04:40.590 --> 00:04:40.600 
and let's see the extension perfect so

00:04:40.600 --> 00:04:42.240 
and let's see the extension perfect so
there<00:04:40.840> it<00:04:40.960> is<00:04:40.990> you<00:04:41.380> have<00:04:41.530> managed<00:04:41.920> to<00:04:41.980> make

00:04:42.240 --> 00:04:42.250 
there it is you have managed to make

00:04:42.250 --> 00:04:44.580 
there it is you have managed to make
yourselves<00:04:42.760> a<00:04:43.000> set<00:04:43.300> of<00:04:43.510> pop-out<00:04:43.990> minecart

00:04:44.580 --> 00:04:44.590 
yourselves a set of pop-out minecart

00:04:44.590 --> 00:04:46.980 
yourselves a set of pop-out minecart
rails<00:04:44.860> these<00:04:45.430> can<00:04:45.700> be<00:04:45.850> extended<00:04:46.300> all<00:04:46.720> the<00:04:46.900> way

00:04:46.980 --> 00:04:46.990 
rails these can be extended all the way

00:04:46.990 --> 00:04:49.680 
rails these can be extended all the way
along<00:04:47.290> using<00:04:48.130> repeaters<00:04:48.520> but<00:04:49.150> this<00:04:49.360> is<00:04:49.540> the

00:04:49.680 --> 00:04:49.690 
along using repeaters but this is the

00:04:49.690 --> 00:04:51.270 
along using repeaters but this is the
furthest<00:04:50.140> that<00:04:50.320> they<00:04:50.440> can<00:04:50.680> go<00:04:50.890> without

00:04:51.270 --> 00:04:51.280 
furthest that they can go without

00:04:51.280 --> 00:04:53.220 
furthest that they can go without
needing<00:04:51.670> another<00:04:51.850> circuit<00:04:52.690> so<00:04:52.870> just<00:04:53.080> bear

00:04:53.220 --> 00:04:53.230 
needing another circuit so just bear

00:04:53.230 --> 00:04:55.920 
needing another circuit so just bear
that<00:04:53.260> in<00:04:53.500> mind<00:04:53.530> it's<00:04:54.220> around<00:04:54.580> about<00:04:54.880> 45<00:04:55.570> blocks

00:04:55.920 --> 00:04:55.930 
that in mind it's around about 45 blocks

00:04:55.930 --> 00:04:57.870 
that in mind it's around about 45 blocks
so<00:04:56.170> it's<00:04:56.200> not<00:04:56.470> that<00:04:56.530> much<00:04:56.710> of<00:04:57.070> a<00:04:57.130> trouble<00:04:57.490> but

00:04:57.870 --> 00:04:57.880 
so it's not that much of a trouble but

00:04:57.880 --> 00:04:59.490 
so it's not that much of a trouble but
