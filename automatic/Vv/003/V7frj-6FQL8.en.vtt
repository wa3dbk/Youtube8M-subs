way<00:00:41.040> to<00:00:41.100> finish<00:00:41.370> the<00:00:41.700> video<00:00:41.820> if<00:00:42.210> he<00:00:42.360> actually

00:00:42.530 --> 00:00:42.540

00:02:48.380 --> 00:02:48.390 
almost six months ago and after two

00:02:48.390 --> 00:02:51.199 
almost six months ago and after two
months<00:02:48.659> of<00:02:48.720> having<00:02:48.900> the<00:02:49.200> computer<00:02:49.709> it<00:02:50.209> would

00:02:51.199 --> 00:02:51.209 
months of having the computer it would

00:02:51.209 --> 00:02:52.940 
months of having the computer it would
not<00:02:51.450> turn<00:02:51.690> back<00:02:51.750> on<00:02:52.139> well<00:02:52.379> it<00:02:52.560> would<00:02:52.709> turn<00:02:52.920> on

00:02:52.940 --> 00:02:52.950 
not turn back on well it would turn on

00:02:52.950 --> 00:02:54.949 
not turn back on well it would turn on
and<00:02:53.489> then<00:02:53.639> shut<00:02:53.909> off<00:02:54.060> whenever<00:02:54.299> it<00:02:54.569> felt<00:02:54.780> like

00:02:54.949 --> 00:02:54.959 
and then shut off whenever it felt like

00:02:54.959 --> 00:02:58.069 
and then shut off whenever it felt like
it<00:02:55.170> so<00:02:55.829> I<00:02:56.389> procrastinated<00:02:57.389> for<00:02:57.659> about<00:02:57.810> three

00:02:58.069 --> 00:02:58.079

00:02:59.930 --> 00:02:59.940 
or four months and went through a big

00:02:59.940 --> 00:03:01.599 
or four months and went through a big
ordeal<00:03:00.359> trying<00:03:00.750> to<00:03:00.840> get<00:03:00.959> it<00:03:01.049> shipped<00:03:01.319> out

00:03:01.599 --> 00:03:01.609

struggling i'm on my old pc now that
only<00:03:13.560> has<00:03:13.799> four<00:03:14.129> gigabytes<00:03:14.579> of<00:03:14.730> ram<00:03:14.970> in<00:03:15.569> my<00:03:15.870> new

give<00:03:19.049> your<00:03:19.169> hair<00:03:19.290> processor<00:03:20.010> and<00:03:20.220> 2<00:03:21.120> terabyte

give your hair processor and 2 terabyte
hard<00:03:21.959> drive<00:03:22.290> so<00:03:22.650> that's<00:03:23.280> a<00:03:23.459> big<00:03:23.730> step<00:03:24.030> up<00:03:24.209> from

hard drive so that's a big step up from
what<00:03:24.449> i'm<00:03:24.690> working<00:03:24.840> with<00:03:25.019> right<00:03:25.319> now<00:03:25.379> i<00:03:25.530> think

00:03:25.699 --> 00:03:25.709 
what i'm working with right now i think

00:03:25.709 --> 00:03:27.830 
what i'm working with right now i think
i'm<00:03:25.980> only<00:03:26.160> working<00:03:26.340> with<00:03:26.549> a<00:03:26.609> two-point<00:03:27.329> to<00:03:27.540> get

00:03:27.830 --> 00:03:27.840 
i'm only working with a two-point to get

00:03:27.840 --> 00:03:29.839 
i'm only working with a two-point to get
your<00:03:27.959> hair<00:03:28.079> processor<00:03:28.769> so<00:03:29.400> that's<00:03:29.579> a<00:03:29.699> whole

00:03:29.839 --> 00:03:29.849 
your hair processor so that's a whole

00:03:29.849 --> 00:03:32.420 
your hair processor so that's a whole
Giga<00:03:30.120> her<00:03:30.329> faster<00:03:30.959> and<00:03:31.169> i<00:03:31.919> was<00:03:32.099> rendering

00:03:32.420 --> 00:03:32.430 
Giga her faster and i was rendering

00:03:32.430 --> 00:03:35.000 
Giga her faster and i was rendering
videos<00:03:32.910> about<00:03:33.359> three<00:03:33.930> or<00:03:33.959> four<00:03:34.109> times<00:03:34.530> as<00:03:34.980> fast

00:03:35.000 --> 00:03:35.010 
videos about three or four times as fast

00:03:35.010 --> 00:03:37.789 
videos about three or four times as fast
as<00:03:35.549> i<00:03:35.699> am<00:03:35.849> now<00:03:35.879> so<00:03:36.449> it's<00:03:36.750> a<00:03:36.840> lot<00:03:37.049> harder<00:03:37.319> to<00:03:37.680> get

00:03:37.789 --> 00:03:37.799 
as i am now so it's a lot harder to get

00:03:37.799 --> 00:03:40.819 
as i am now so it's a lot harder to get
