00:00:09.349 --> 00:00:15.420
 just look at the difference 

00:00:12.870 --> 00:00:18.869
 between forages 

00:00:15.420 --> 00:00:21.180
 brs paiaguás does not suffer as much 

00:00:18.869 --> 00:00:24.570
 intensity the effects caused by the 

00:00:21.180 --> 00:00:27.390
 drought, and this is because the 

00:00:24.570 --> 00:00:29.250
 Brachiaria brizantha was developed 

00:00:27.390 --> 00:00:31.740
 by the cutting arm 

00:00:29.250 --> 00:00:33.300
 with a focus on the period of 

00:00:31.740 --> 00:00:35.460
 drought 

00:00:33.300 --> 00:00:38.070
 the productivity differential in the period 

00:00:35.460 --> 00:00:40.379
 greater availability of leaves and 

00:00:38.070 --> 00:00:42.120
 leaves with better nutritional value is 

00:00:40.379 --> 00:00:45.750
 period of drought that it surrounds 

00:00:42.120 --> 00:00:48.300
 9% crude protein around 60% of 

00:00:45.750 --> 00:00:50.340
 digestibility in terms of the 

00:00:48.300 --> 00:00:52.890
 comparing the cultivars 

00:00:50.340 --> 00:00:55.620
 brizantha is the earliest then she 

00:00:52.890 --> 00:00:59.219
 flourishes in the second half of 

00:00:55.620 --> 00:01:00.899
 December came early in the summer, right? 

00:00:59.219 --> 00:01:03.539
 This is interesting here too. 

00:01:00.899 --> 00:01:06.119
 because it stays the rest of the summer and 

00:01:03.539 --> 00:01:09.540
 autumn vegetate nuno emitting new 

00:01:06.119 --> 00:01:11.970
 new sheets and that associated with 

00:01:09.540 --> 00:01:14.189
 with intense tillering that she has in 

00:01:11.970 --> 00:01:17.549
 Profile number terms her profile is 

00:01:14.189 --> 00:01:18.950
 very well covers the soil very well and 

00:01:17.549 --> 00:01:21.150
 these two these two points 

00:01:18.950 --> 00:01:23.250
 early bloom more intense 

00:01:21.150 --> 00:01:25.259
 my profile remains vegetative 

00:01:23.250 --> 00:01:27.060
 after flowering this is very 

00:01:25.259 --> 00:01:30.420
 important because it supports this greater 

00:01:27.060 --> 00:01:33.799
 productivity in the 51 st look 

00:01:30.420 --> 00:01:37.290
 more trained person is able to 

00:01:33.799 --> 00:01:39.420
 differences let's get attention here 

00:01:37.290 --> 00:01:41.490
 not the morphological characteristics here 

00:01:39.420 --> 00:01:43.500
 that distinguishes in relation to the marandu by 

00:01:41.490 --> 00:01:47.700
 A damn good example. 

00:01:43.500 --> 00:01:50.100
 as they are finer and much finer than 

00:01:47.700 --> 00:01:51.000
 that living than find that with 

00:01:50.100 --> 00:01:56.070
 thinner 

00:01:51.000 --> 00:01:58.710
 the leaves are narrower, no more 

00:01:56.070 --> 00:02:01.380
 close but also in terms of greater 

00:01:58.710 --> 00:02:03.060
 leaf number has enough quantity 

00:02:01.380 --> 00:02:05.130
 of leaves 

00:02:03.060 --> 00:02:07.560
 another point that also distinguishes 

00:02:05.130 --> 00:02:10.950
 enough this material here is that both 

00:02:07.560 --> 00:02:13.590
 The leaf blade sheath hem sheath 

00:02:10.950 --> 00:02:15.989
 of the sheet that embrace as not 

00:02:13.590 --> 00:02:17.910
 Why these folks get the memo? 

00:02:15.989 --> 00:02:21.450
 have been bleached is not quite 

00:02:17.910 --> 00:02:24.780
 both the leaf blade and the sheath 

00:02:21.450 --> 00:02:27.000
 besides all these advantages the paiaguás 

00:02:24.780 --> 00:02:30.930
 is the first cultivar of Brachiaria 

00:02:27.000 --> 00:02:34.860
 brizantha selected and recommended for 

00:02:30.930 --> 00:02:37.200
 use in an integrated system is a 

00:02:34.860 --> 00:02:39.239
 very interesting in a context of 

00:02:37.200 --> 00:02:41.340
 integration of livestock farming because 

00:02:39.239 --> 00:02:43.349
 you be and off - season and pretty 

00:02:41.340 --> 00:02:45.269
 productive in the circus period you can 

00:02:43.349 --> 00:02:47.040
 use this punch to feed the 

00:02:45.269 --> 00:02:50.400
 cattle in the off season is the so-called ox 

00:02:47.040 --> 00:02:53.280
 and if the producer has no cattle 

00:02:50.400 --> 00:02:55.140
 in the off- season to make straw is not 

00:02:53.280 --> 00:02:58.500
 a good option to make stopped for the 

00:02:55.140 --> 00:03:03.269
 tillage and is easy to dry out 

00:02:58.500 --> 00:03:04.890
 an option of use by the producer 

00:03:03.269 --> 00:03:07.019
 if we think about the context of 

00:03:04.890 --> 00:03:09.569
 recovery of degraded pasture that 

00:03:07.019 --> 00:03:11.940
 estimate is that among people we have 70% 

00:03:09.569 --> 00:03:15.180
 of our passages are degraded 

00:03:11.940 --> 00:03:17.310
 shows some level of degradation of 

00:03:15.180 --> 00:03:19.829
 pasture is a great alternative 

00:03:17.310 --> 00:03:22.950
 for us to recover this space to leave 

00:03:19.829 --> 00:03:24.750
 via agriculture in the context of 

00:03:22.950 --> 00:03:28.530
 Livestock farming integration 

00:03:24.750 --> 00:03:32.280
 seeds arrive on the market from 

00:03:28.530 --> 00:03:34.799
 September the senator's fee to use 

00:03:32.280 --> 00:03:37.349
 around three and a half to five kilos 

00:03:34.799 --> 00:03:39.450
 of viable pure seeds per hectare 

00:03:37.349 --> 00:03:40.410
 also points out that the seed was 

00:03:39.450 --> 00:03:42.630
 slightly smaller 

00:03:40.410 --> 00:03:44.430
 then one kilogram of paiaguás seed 

00:03:42.630 --> 00:03:46.829
 has more seeds than a kilo 

00:03:44.430 --> 00:03:48.720
 slowing down for example, huh? 

00:03:46.829 --> 00:03:51.359
 so if you use a quantity one 

00:03:48.720 --> 00:03:54.109
 little bigger you will close formal step 

00:03:51.359 --> 00:03:56.609
 a little faster and it 's c with the 

00:03:54.109 --> 00:03:58.620
 use a slightly smaller amount 

00:03:56.609 --> 00:04:00.329
 because it has a greater number of 

00:03:58.620 --> 00:04:02.819
 seed per kilo it will have a 

00:04:00.329 --> 00:04:04.500
 relatively good training 

00:04:02.819 --> 00:04:07.109
 if you use a slightly higher rate will 

00:04:04.500 --> 00:04:09.419
 to form faster but more 

00:04:07.109 --> 00:04:10.829
 sowing and quantity so are 

00:04:09.419 --> 00:04:13.079
 similar to the producer is already 

00:04:10.829 --> 00:04:15.560
 accustomed to lisandro 

00:04:13.079 --> 00:04:15.560
 sliding
