another antenna on it different
variations<00:01:41.590> of<00:01:41.770> these<00:01:42.040> radios<00:01:42.399> have

00:01:42.600 --> 00:01:42.610 
variations of these radios have

00:01:42.610 --> 00:01:44.310 
variations of these radios have
different<00:01:42.970> receivers<00:01:43.390> so<00:01:43.630> all<00:01:44.020> of<00:01:44.079> them

00:01:44.310 --> 00:01:44.320 
different receivers so all of them

00:01:44.320 --> 00:01:45.929 
different receivers so all of them
function<00:01:44.710> the<00:01:44.770> same<00:01:44.979> the<00:01:45.610> buying<00:01:45.790> process

00:01:45.929 --> 00:01:45.939 
function the same the buying process

00:01:45.939 --> 00:01:47.609 
function the same the buying process
will<00:01:46.360> be<00:01:46.450> different<00:01:46.630> so<00:01:47.229> I'm<00:01:47.290> going<00:01:47.439> to<00:01:47.470> run

a blitz RC works jeo 198 and that's what
the<00:02:23.060> receivers<00:02:23.450> look<00:02:23.660> like<00:02:23.870> and<00:02:24.080> take<00:02:24.890> note<00:02:25.099> on

00:02:25.330 --> 00:02:25.340 
the receivers look like and take note on

00:02:25.340 --> 00:02:27.009 
the receivers look like and take note on
the<00:02:25.730> receiver<00:02:26.120> there<00:02:26.330> is<00:02:26.420> a<00:02:26.450> small<00:02:26.780> little

00:02:27.009 --> 00:02:27.019 
the receiver there is a small little

00:02:27.019 --> 00:02:29.920 
the receiver there is a small little
button<00:02:27.410> up<00:02:27.590> here<00:02:27.860> and<00:02:28.040> it<00:02:28.550> reads<00:02:28.930> frequency

00:02:29.920 --> 00:02:29.930 
button up here and it reads frequency

00:02:29.930 --> 00:02:31.869 
button up here and it reads frequency
button<00:02:30.500> little<00:02:31.040> thing<00:02:31.250> in<00:02:31.370> yellow<00:02:31.610> right

there and that's what we're going to use

00:02:43.250 --> 00:02:47.140 
there and that's what we're going to use
to<00:02:43.430> bind<00:02:43.670> this<00:02:44.150> system<00:02:44.620> okay<00:02:45.760> systems<00:02:46.760> become

sure<00:03:07.549> before<00:03:07.819> you<00:03:08.030> rebind<00:03:08.540> that<00:03:08.989> your

00:03:09.100 --> 00:03:09.110 
sure before you rebind that your

00:03:09.110 --> 00:03:10.869 
sure before you rebind that your
throttle<00:03:09.560> stick<00:03:09.799> here<00:03:10.099> and<00:03:10.250> the<00:03:10.549> throttle

00:03:10.869 --> 00:03:10.879 
throttle stick here and the throttle

00:03:10.879 --> 00:03:13.300 
throttle stick here and the throttle
trim<00:03:11.120> here<00:03:11.360> these<00:03:11.870> two<00:03:12.110> are<00:03:12.140> set<00:03:12.739> down<00:03:12.769> to<00:03:13.190> the

00:03:13.300 --> 00:03:13.310 
trim here these two are set down to the

00:03:13.310 --> 00:03:16.449 
trim here these two are set down to the
lowest<00:03:13.579> position<00:03:13.879> okay<00:03:14.870> so<00:03:15.170> that<00:03:15.560> when<00:03:16.340> it

00:03:16.449 --> 00:03:16.459 
lowest position okay so that when it

00:03:16.459 --> 00:03:18.460 
lowest position okay so that when it
does<00:03:16.640> become<00:03:17.480> binding<00:03:17.690> it<00:03:17.959> doesn't<00:03:18.200> take<00:03:18.319> off

00:03:18.460 --> 00:03:18.470 
does become binding it doesn't take off

00:03:18.470 --> 00:03:20.949 
does become binding it doesn't take off
on<00:03:18.680> you<00:03:18.860> and<00:03:19.069> it's<00:03:19.250> that<00:03:19.489> becomes<00:03:19.819> a<00:03:20.030> hazarding

00:03:20.949 --> 00:03:20.959 
on you and it's that becomes a hazarding

00:03:20.959 --> 00:03:22.750 
on you and it's that becomes a hazarding
like<00:03:21.140> that<00:03:21.319> so<00:03:21.560> be<00:03:21.829> careful<00:03:22.160> with<00:03:22.310> that<00:03:22.340> and

00:03:22.750 --> 00:03:22.760 
like that so be careful with that and

00:03:22.760 --> 00:03:24.789 
like that so be careful with that and
keep<00:03:22.880> your<00:03:23.000> throttle<00:03:23.660> and<00:03:23.780> the<00:03:23.840> trim<00:03:24.260> down<00:03:24.590> in

00:03:24.789 --> 00:03:24.799 
keep your throttle and the trim down in

00:03:24.799 --> 00:03:27.190 
keep your throttle and the trim down in
the<00:03:24.859> lowest<00:03:25.160> position<00:03:25.310> before<00:03:25.730> you<00:03:26.180> bind<00:03:26.510> okay

00:03:27.190 --> 00:03:27.200 
the lowest position before you bind okay

00:03:27.200 --> 00:03:29.410 
the lowest position before you bind okay

system has been binded very simple

00:04:09.440 --> 00:04:11.319 
system has been binded very simple
process<00:04:09.620> here<00:04:09.950> right<00:04:10.459> now<00:04:10.639> everything<00:04:11.269> is

00:04:11.319 --> 00:04:11.329 
process here right now everything is

00:04:11.329 --> 00:04:12.909 
process here right now everything is
turned<00:04:11.569> off<00:04:11.720> your<00:04:11.989> aircraft<00:04:12.440> is<00:04:12.560> not<00:04:12.739> plugged

00:04:12.909 --> 00:04:12.919 
turned off your aircraft is not plugged

00:04:12.919 --> 00:04:14.740 
turned off your aircraft is not plugged
in<00:04:13.190> and<00:04:13.400> the<00:04:13.790> transmitter<00:04:14.209> is<00:04:14.269> in<00:04:14.510> the<00:04:14.599> off

00:04:14.740 --> 00:04:14.750 
in and the transmitter is in the off

00:04:14.750 --> 00:04:17.229 
in and the transmitter is in the off
position<00:04:14.780> as<00:04:15.470> well<00:04:15.859> so<00:04:16.579> right<00:04:16.849> now<00:04:16.880> we<00:04:17.090> got<00:04:17.209> the

00:04:17.229 --> 00:04:17.239 
position as well so right now we got the

00:04:17.239 --> 00:04:18.670 
position as well so right now we got the
lipo<00:04:17.570> here<00:04:17.780> what<00:04:17.959> we're<00:04:18.109> going<00:04:18.229> to<00:04:18.320> do<00:04:18.500> is

00:04:18.670 --> 00:04:18.680 
lipo here what we're going to do is

00:04:18.680 --> 00:04:21.580 
lipo here what we're going to do is
we're<00:04:19.340> going<00:04:19.430> to<00:04:19.519> plug<00:04:19.700> the<00:04:20.120> battery<00:04:20.450> into<00:04:21.260> the

00:04:21.580 --> 00:04:21.590 
we're going to plug the battery into the

00:04:21.590 --> 00:04:24.159 
we're going to plug the battery into the
lipo<00:04:22.130> into<00:04:22.430> the<00:04:22.520> aircraft<00:04:22.880> and<00:04:23.120> what's<00:04:24.020> going

00:04:24.159 --> 00:04:24.169 
lipo into the aircraft and what's going

00:04:24.169 --> 00:04:28.120 
lipo into the aircraft and what's going
to<00:04:24.200> happen<00:04:24.530> here<00:04:24.740> is<00:04:25.630> the<00:04:26.630> receiver<00:04:27.409> will<00:04:27.710> pick

00:04:28.120 --> 00:04:28.130 
to happen here is the receiver will pick

00:04:28.130 --> 00:04:29.589 
to happen here is the receiver will pick
up<00:04:28.250> no<00:04:28.430> signal<00:04:28.849> right<00:04:29.000> now<00:04:29.150> whatsoever

up no signal right now whatsoever

00:04:29.599 --> 00:04:30.940 
up no signal right now whatsoever
because<00:04:29.780> the<00:04:29.990> transmitter

00:04:30.940 --> 00:04:30.950 
because the transmitter

00:04:30.950 --> 00:04:33.550 
because the transmitter
in<00:04:31.130> the<00:04:31.310> off<00:04:31.430> position<00:04:31.750> ok<00:04:32.750> this<00:04:33.050> is<00:04:33.200> the<00:04:33.230> bind

00:04:33.550 --> 00:04:33.560 
in the off position ok this is the bind

00:04:33.560 --> 00:04:35.080 
in the off position ok this is the bind
mode<00:04:33.770> so<00:04:34.130> what<00:04:34.280> we're<00:04:34.370> going<00:04:34.460> to<00:04:34.550> do<00:04:34.640> now<00:04:34.790> is

starting<00:04:54.440> to<00:04:54.470> blink<00:04:54.800> ok<00:04:55.370> at<00:04:55.550> that<00:04:55.820> time<00:04:56.030> you

00:04:56.080 --> 00:04:56.090 
starting to blink ok at that time you

00:04:56.090 --> 00:04:58.960 
starting to blink ok at that time you
can<00:04:56.360> let<00:04:56.510> go<00:04:56.540> of<00:04:56.780> that<00:04:56.960> and<00:04:57.320> um<00:04:58.100> it<00:04:58.520> stops

00:04:58.960 --> 00:04:58.970 
can let go of that and um it stops

00:04:58.970 --> 00:05:00.700 
can let go of that and um it stops
blinking<00:04:59.240> so<00:04:59.660> you<00:04:59.750> have<00:05:00.080> that<00:05:00.290> amount<00:05:00.530> of<00:05:00.650> time

00:05:00.700 --> 00:05:00.710 
blinking so you have that amount of time

00:05:00.710 --> 00:05:02.380 
blinking so you have that amount of time
to<00:05:01.040> get<00:05:01.100> the<00:05:01.220> transmitter<00:05:01.640> turned<00:05:01.850> on<00:05:02.000> so<00:05:02.240> now

00:05:02.380 --> 00:05:02.390 
to get the transmitter turned on so now

00:05:02.390 --> 00:05:03.760
