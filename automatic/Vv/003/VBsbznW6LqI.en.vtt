00:00:01.820 --> 00:00:05.690
 as anna mi mira I am talent and the 

00:00:04.160 --> 00:00:08.599
 Today I am going to teach you how to 

00:00:05.690 --> 00:00:10.790
 find this case remain as headquarters with 

00:00:08.599 --> 00:00:13.280
 those neon lights that I put is called 

00:00:10.790 --> 00:00:15.049
 impressive or duch and the truth is that it is 

00:00:13.280 --> 00:00:16.730
 one of the best cars that have gotten 

00:00:15.049 --> 00:00:18.590
 in the gta for the next generation 

00:00:16.730 --> 00:00:20.630
 in this video I'm going to show you how 

00:00:18.590 --> 00:00:22.340
 find it which is very simple and 

00:00:20.630 --> 00:00:24.410
 very easy they are going to have to have 

00:00:22.340 --> 00:00:26.269
 unlocked to trevor it seems to me 

00:00:24.410 --> 00:00:28.369
 to find they can not come to 

00:00:26.269 --> 00:00:29.720
 find with maikel or with franklin but 

00:00:28.369 --> 00:00:31.460
 that I think there must be 

00:00:29.720 --> 00:00:33.740
 unlocked before to clover so that they 

00:00:31.460 --> 00:00:34.940
 appear this mission once we are 

00:00:33.740 --> 00:00:36.500
 here we are going to have to come to the 

00:00:34.940 --> 00:00:38.660
 location that I am showing on the map 

00:00:36.500 --> 00:00:40.910
 where is the spray pay here from 

00:00:38.660 --> 00:00:42.140
 blend conti the only pe spray that there is 

00:00:40.910 --> 00:00:43.969
 out of town we are going to have to 

00:00:42.140 --> 00:00:46.160
 come here as you can see on the map and 

00:00:43.969 --> 00:00:47.960
 I have a blue indicator and it's because of 

00:00:46.160 --> 00:00:50.149
 made the car to grab it makes us a 

00:00:47.960 --> 00:00:52.910
 secondary mission but as you can see 

00:00:50.149 --> 00:00:54.980
 This is 100% accurate 100% location 

00:00:52.910 --> 00:00:57.350
 confirmed everything has come out here and 

00:00:54.980 --> 00:00:59.059
 here is the imposing or duch that as 

00:00:57.350 --> 00:01:00.590
 can see is a muscle car and the 

00:00:59.059 --> 00:01:02.420
 truth is that it is a carrazo is like a 

00:01:00.590 --> 00:01:04.580
 war tank when you approach 

00:01:02.420 --> 00:01:07.610
 it seems almost almost the batmobile see how 

00:01:04.580 --> 00:01:08.420
 it's made the windshield looks like a boat 

00:01:07.610 --> 00:01:10.009
 mobile 

00:01:08.420 --> 00:01:12.290
 so that completely a tank 

00:01:10.009 --> 00:01:14.150
 bullets do not enter you at all so 

00:01:12.290 --> 00:01:15.350
 it's amazing something that I loved about 

00:01:14.150 --> 00:01:17.240
 this car that I am going to show you 

00:01:15.350 --> 00:01:19.549
 completely all the best of this 

00:01:17.240 --> 00:01:21.380
 car is when you lose the lights in a 

00:01:19.549 --> 00:01:22.909
 day when the lights are turned on 

00:01:21.380 --> 00:01:24.560
 the cabin right now they will see how they turn on 

00:01:22.909 --> 00:01:26.420
 the lights and how they light up 

00:01:24.560 --> 00:01:28.399
 completely the board and the cabin 

00:01:26.420 --> 00:01:30.350
 also as you know, the 

00:01:28.399 --> 00:01:32.270
 sticks when you put the handbrake 

00:01:30.350 --> 00:01:34.159
 put the real christmas icons the 

00:01:32.270 --> 00:01:35.990
 It is true that he has made you the forgiveness 

00:01:34.159 --> 00:01:37.970
 rockstar has done very good things with 

00:01:35.990 --> 00:01:39.740
 the change of gt Ã¡lex well is something that 

00:01:37.970 --> 00:01:41.360
 these little details like for example 

00:01:39.740 --> 00:01:44.060
 When you turn on the highs, the 

00:01:41.360 --> 00:01:45.770
 foquito is amazing now see this from 

00:01:44.060 --> 00:01:48.560
 here like when he turned off the lights he 

00:01:45.770 --> 00:01:50.179
 they close the headlights stopping the lights and 

00:01:48.560 --> 00:01:52.190
 they reopen the headlights the truth is 

00:01:50.179 --> 00:01:54.020
 a very unique style that this car has 

00:01:52.190 --> 00:01:55.399
 and as I tell you when you grab it 

00:01:54.020 --> 00:01:57.740
 and in exactly when we started 

00:01:55.399 --> 00:01:59.509
 handle what trailers people are going to see 

00:01:57.740 --> 00:02:01.580
 they want to kill us so the car 

00:01:59.509 --> 00:02:04.130
 as I said in rockstar is a death 

00:02:01.580 --> 00:02:05.690
 sure so without more or less when 

00:02:04.130 --> 00:02:06.979
 we end up killing everyone 

00:02:05.690 --> 00:02:08.660
 that we can get all that we can 

00:02:06.979 --> 00:02:10.549
 have our car to customize what 

00:02:08.660 --> 00:02:12.290
 as you want to see here as I was 

00:02:10.549 --> 00:02:13.940
 putting neon lights that is something else 

00:02:12.290 --> 00:02:14.780
 that only they added to the gta of 

00:02:13.940 --> 00:02:17.720
 following 

00:02:14.780 --> 00:02:19.280
 I think that just like I do not have 

00:02:17.720 --> 00:02:21.709
 keep it with those neon lights it 

00:02:19.280 --> 00:02:23.120
 I looked perfectly sexy you can also 

00:02:21.709 --> 00:02:25.310
 change to make a combination of 

00:02:23.120 --> 00:02:28.520
 colors as you can see there but I what 

00:02:25.310 --> 00:02:30.590
 I left more so see this cool car 

00:02:28.520 --> 00:02:31.910
