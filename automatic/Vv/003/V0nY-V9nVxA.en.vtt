00:01:55.219 --> 00:01:57.399 
probes no gas yet very important to note
guys<00:01:55.429> we've<00:01:56.119> got<00:01:56.329> this<00:01:56.479> gateway<00:01:56.719> almost<00:01:57.200> done

00:01:57.399 --> 00:01:57.409 
guys we've got this gateway almost done

00:01:57.409 --> 00:01:59.649 
guys we've got this gateway almost done
and<00:01:57.649> there<00:01:57.770> is<00:01:57.920> no<00:01:58.280> gas<00:01:58.579> so<00:01:58.939> you<00:01:59.209> can<00:01:59.390> probably

00:01:59.649 --> 00:01:59.659 
and there is no gas so you can probably

00:01:59.659 --> 00:02:01.120 
and there is no gas so you can probably
already<00:01:59.989> guess<00:02:00.409> what's<00:02:00.739> gonna<00:02:00.860> be<00:02:01.099> happening

00:02:01.120 --> 00:02:01.130 
already guess what's gonna be happening

00:02:01.130 --> 00:02:05.319 
already guess what's gonna be happening
and<00:02:01.759> just<00:02:02.659> as<00:02:02.810> I<00:02:02.929> said<00:02:02.989> at<00:02:03.610> we<00:02:04.610> do<00:02:04.819> see<00:02:05.060> some

00:02:05.319 --> 00:02:05.329 
and just as I said at we do see some

00:02:05.329 --> 00:02:07.270 
and just as I said at we do see some
kind<00:02:05.509> of<00:02:05.569> cheese<00:02:05.780> here<00:02:06.049> white<00:02:06.289> Rob<00:02:06.530> putting<00:02:07.130> a

00:02:07.270 --> 00:02:07.280 
kind of cheese here white Rob putting a

00:02:07.280 --> 00:02:10.389 
kind of cheese here white Rob putting a
pylon<00:02:07.729> up<00:02:08.060> in<00:02:08.269> Jin<00:02:09.170> Rose<00:02:09.349> base<00:02:09.649> not<00:02:10.039> sure<00:02:10.280> if

00:02:10.389 --> 00:02:10.399 
pylon up in Jin Rose base not sure if

00:02:10.399 --> 00:02:11.559 
pylon up in Jin Rose base not sure if
that's<00:02:10.489> going<00:02:10.670> to<00:02:10.729> be<00:02:10.849> used<00:02:10.940> for<00:02:11.030> warp<00:02:11.390> in

00:02:11.559 --> 00:02:11.569 
that's going to be used for warp in

00:02:11.569 --> 00:02:13.119 
that's going to be used for warp in
later<00:02:11.840> or<00:02:12.140> if<00:02:12.290> he's<00:02:12.440> just<00:02:12.470> gonna<00:02:12.799> build<00:02:13.040> a

00:02:13.119 --> 00:02:13.129 
later or if he's just gonna build a

00:02:13.129 --> 00:02:15.940 
later or if he's just gonna build a
couple<00:02:13.280> of<00:02:13.430> gateways<00:02:13.819> there<00:02:14.349> I'm<00:02:15.349> guessing

00:02:15.940 --> 00:02:15.950 
couple of gateways there I'm guessing

00:02:15.950 --> 00:02:17.830 
couple of gateways there I'm guessing
more<00:02:16.160> of<00:02:16.340> the<00:02:16.459> gateways<00:02:16.879> because<00:02:17.450> of<00:02:17.569> the<00:02:17.629> fact

00:02:17.830 --> 00:02:17.840 
more of the gateways because of the fact

00:02:17.840 --> 00:02:19.750 
more of the gateways because of the fact
that<00:02:18.019> there<00:02:18.260> is<00:02:18.290> no<00:02:18.530> gas<00:02:18.769> yet<00:02:19.069> and<00:02:19.280> of<00:02:19.730> course

00:02:19.750 --> 00:02:19.760 
that there is no gas yet and of course

00:02:19.760 --> 00:02:22.150 
that there is no gas yet and of course
jinro<00:02:20.420> sees<00:02:20.660> that<00:02:20.810> there<00:02:20.959> is<00:02:21.110> no<00:02:21.379> gas<00:02:21.650> yet<00:02:21.980> and

00:02:22.150 --> 00:02:22.160 
jinro sees that there is no gas yet and

00:02:22.160 --> 00:02:24.729 
jinro sees that there is no gas yet and
that<00:02:22.190> there<00:02:22.849> is<00:02:22.879> one<00:02:23.299> gateway<00:02:23.569> already<00:02:23.989> so

00:02:24.729 --> 00:02:24.739 
that there is one gateway already so

00:02:24.739 --> 00:02:27.190 
that there is one gateway already so
he's<00:02:25.190> going<00:02:25.579> to<00:02:25.700> be<00:02:26.030> putting<00:02:26.360> a<00:02:26.540> putting<00:02:26.989> down

00:02:27.190 --> 00:02:27.200 
he's going to be putting a putting down

00:02:27.200 --> 00:02:29.470 
he's going to be putting a putting down
yeah<00:02:27.440> bunker<00:02:28.010> here<00:02:28.400> and<00:02:28.579> just<00:02:29.090> pumping<00:02:29.420> Oh

00:02:29.470 --> 00:02:29.480 
yeah bunker here and just pumping Oh

00:02:29.480 --> 00:02:32.559 
yeah bunker here and just pumping Oh
marines<00:02:29.840> getting<00:02:30.319> a<00:02:30.470> reactor<00:02:31.190> and<00:02:31.430> once<00:02:32.389> again

marines getting a reactor and once again

00:02:32.569 --> 00:02:35.860 
marines getting a reactor and once again
I'm<00:02:32.840> not<00:02:32.870> sure<00:02:33.410> if<00:02:33.530> I<00:02:33.680> agree<00:02:33.709> with<00:02:34.160> this<00:02:34.870> just

00:02:35.860 --> 00:02:35.870 
I'm not sure if I agree with this just

00:02:35.870 --> 00:02:37.539 
I'm not sure if I agree with this just
for<00:02:36.019> the<00:02:36.079> fact<00:02:36.230> the<00:02:36.440> reactor<00:02:36.950> takes<00:02:37.190> twice<00:02:37.489> as

00:02:37.539 --> 00:02:37.549 
for the fact the reactor takes twice as

00:02:37.549 --> 00:02:40.449 
for the fact the reactor takes twice as
long<00:02:37.760> as<00:02:38.030> the<00:02:38.120> tech<00:02:38.329> lab<00:02:38.569> so<00:02:39.260> that's<00:02:39.440> what<00:02:40.010> 50

00:02:40.449 --> 00:02:40.459 
long as the tech lab so that's what 50

00:02:40.459 --> 00:02:43.449 
long as the tech lab so that's what 50
and<00:02:40.940> 50<00:02:41.450> units<00:02:41.750> of<00:02:41.870> time<00:02:42.109> that<00:02:42.799> the<00:02:43.099> barracks

00:02:43.449 --> 00:02:43.459 
and 50 units of time that the barracks

00:02:43.459 --> 00:02:45.460 
and 50 units of time that the barracks
is<00:02:43.609> not<00:02:43.849> producing<00:02:44.450> and<00:02:44.660> he<00:02:44.780> already<00:02:45.109> knows

00:02:45.460 --> 00:02:45.470 
is not producing and he already knows

00:02:45.470 --> 00:02:48.039 
is not producing and he already knows
that<00:02:45.799> there<00:02:46.130> is<00:02:46.160> cell<00:02:46.609> it's<00:02:46.790> on<00:02:47.000> the<00:02:47.209> way<00:02:47.359> he

00:02:48.039 --> 00:02:48.049 
that there is cell it's on the way he

00:02:48.049 --> 00:02:50.440 
that there is cell it's on the way he
did<00:02:48.260> see<00:02:48.500> this<00:02:48.650> being<00:02:48.829> grown<00:02:49.190> a<00:02:49.220> boost

00:02:50.440 --> 00:02:50.450 
did see this being grown a boost

00:02:50.450 --> 00:02:53.260 
did see this being grown a boost
he<00:02:50.629> wins<00:02:50.810> go<00:02:51.140> to<00:02:51.200> the<00:02:51.379> gas<00:02:51.620> and<00:02:52.040> we<00:02:52.760> still<00:02:53.060> see

00:02:53.260 --> 00:02:53.270 
he wins go to the gas and we still see

00:02:53.270 --> 00:02:55.360 
he wins go to the gas and we still see
the<00:02:53.420> second<00:02:53.870> and<00:02:54.020> third<00:02:54.050> gateway<00:02:54.860> coming<00:02:55.250> up

00:02:55.360 --> 00:02:55.370 
the second and third gateway coming up

00:02:55.370 --> 00:02:57.729 
the second and third gateway coming up
for<00:02:55.730> white<00:02:55.940> Roth<00:02:56.150> in<00:02:56.390> the<00:02:56.840> heart<00:02:57.110> of<00:02:57.290> gin<00:02:57.560> rose

00:02:57.739 --> 00:03:01.750 
for white Roth in the heart of gin rose
base<00:02:59.170> so<00:03:00.170> yeah<00:03:00.620> we're<00:03:00.920> going<00:03:01.099> to<00:03:01.160> see<00:03:01.340> a<00:03:01.370> lot<00:03:01.550> of

00:03:01.750 --> 00:03:01.760 
base so yeah we're going to see a lot of

00:03:01.760 --> 00:03:03.550 
base so yeah we're going to see a lot of
