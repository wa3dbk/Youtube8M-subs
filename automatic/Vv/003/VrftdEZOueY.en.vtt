about 10 feet 500 pound 526 pounds just
going<00:01:09.750> off<00:01:09.869> random<00:01:10.350> numbers<00:01:10.680> here<00:01:10.890> just<00:01:11.430> from

00:01:11.539 --> 00:01:11.549 
going off random numbers here just from

00:01:11.549 --> 00:01:14.030 
going off random numbers here just from
what<00:01:11.700> i<00:01:11.729> could<00:01:11.820> guess<00:01:12.590> cuz<00:01:13.590> we<00:01:13.710> don't<00:01:13.890> get<00:01:14.010> a

00:01:14.030 --> 00:01:14.040 
what i could guess cuz we don't get a

00:01:14.040 --> 00:01:16.760 
what i could guess cuz we don't get a
lot<00:01:14.189> of<00:01:14.250> stats<00:01:14.610> from<00:01:14.850> blue<00:01:15.150> eyes<00:01:15.299> so<00:01:15.780> it's<00:01:16.619> a

00:01:16.760 --> 00:01:16.770 
lot of stats from blue eyes so it's a

00:01:16.770 --> 00:01:18.770 
lot of stats from blue eyes so it's a
little<00:01:16.950> complicated<00:01:17.250> the<00:01:18.060> guy's<00:01:18.330> actual

00:01:18.770 --> 00:01:18.780 
little complicated the guy's actual

00:01:18.780 --> 00:01:19.490 
little complicated the guy's actual
height<00:01:18.960> and<00:01:19.140> weight

00:01:19.490 --> 00:01:19.500 
height and weight

00:01:19.500 --> 00:01:22.010 
height and weight
so<00:01:20.340> with<00:01:20.610> blue<00:01:20.850> eyes<00:01:20.970> being<00:01:21.299> almost<00:01:21.479> double

00:01:22.010 --> 00:01:22.020 
so with blue eyes being almost double

00:01:22.020 --> 00:01:23.660 
so with blue eyes being almost double
the<00:01:22.170> height<00:01:22.650> and<00:01:22.830> weight<00:01:22.950> of<00:01:22.979> Charizard<00:01:23.549> he's

00:01:23.660 --> 00:01:23.670

you'll<00:02:58.549> know<00:02:58.640> what<00:02:58.790> I<00:02:58.880> mean<00:02:59.890> so<00:03:01.540> and<00:03:02.540> also<00:03:02.959> if

00:03:03.220 --> 00:03:03.230 
you'll know what I mean so and also if

00:03:03.230 --> 00:03:04.900 
you'll know what I mean so and also if
he<00:03:03.319> gets<00:03:03.500> knocked<00:03:03.799> to<00:03:04.099> the<00:03:04.130> ground<00:03:04.280> while

00:03:04.900 --> 00:03:04.910 
he gets knocked to the ground while

00:03:04.910 --> 00:03:07.449 
he gets knocked to the ground while
flying<00:03:05.239> he'll<00:03:05.989> also<00:03:06.110> get<00:03:06.319> severely<00:03:06.620> damaged

00:03:07.449 --> 00:03:07.459 
flying he'll also get severely damaged

00:03:07.459 --> 00:03:09.520 
flying he'll also get severely damaged
but<00:03:07.730> same<00:03:07.940> thing<00:03:07.970> with<00:03:08.239> blue<00:03:08.420> eyes<00:03:08.630> so<00:03:08.959> that's

00:03:09.520 --> 00:03:09.530 
but same thing with blue eyes so that's

00:03:09.530 --> 00:03:12.759 
but same thing with blue eyes so that's
not<00:03:09.709> really<00:03:09.890> much<00:03:10.599> everything<00:03:11.599> all<00:03:12.140> dragons

00:03:12.759 --> 00:03:12.769 
not really much everything all dragons

00:03:12.769 --> 00:03:13.809 
not really much everything all dragons
will<00:03:12.890> get<00:03:13.010> severely<00:03:13.310> hurt<00:03:13.489> if<00:03:13.579> they<00:03:13.670> hit<00:03:13.760> the

00:03:13.809 --> 00:03:13.819 
will get severely hurt if they hit the

00:03:13.819 --> 00:03:16.840 
will get severely hurt if they hit the
ground<00:03:14.030> after<00:03:14.390> they<00:03:14.510> were<00:03:14.569> flying<00:03:15.370> now<00:03:16.370> let's

00:03:16.840 --> 00:03:16.850 
ground after they were flying now let's

00:03:16.850 --> 00:03:22.920 
ground after they were flying now let's
get<00:03:17.030> talking<00:03:17.269> about<00:03:17.920> strengths<00:03:19.690> so<00:03:21.130> Charizard

00:03:22.920 --> 00:03:22.930 
get talking about strengths so Charizard

00:03:22.930 --> 00:03:30.490 
get talking about strengths so Charizard
he's<00:03:23.930> fast<00:03:25.209> he's<00:03:26.209> sort<00:03:26.750> of<00:03:26.959> tactical<00:03:27.970> and<00:03:29.500> he's

00:03:30.490 --> 00:03:30.500 
he's fast he's sort of tactical and he's

00:03:30.500 --> 00:03:35.410 
he's fast he's sort of tactical and he's
more<00:03:30.709> controlled<00:03:31.840> than<00:03:32.840> blue<00:03:33.319> eyes<00:03:34.389> blue<00:03:35.389> eyes

00:03:35.410 --> 00:03:35.420 
more controlled than blue eyes blue eyes

00:03:35.420 --> 00:03:39.059 
more controlled than blue eyes blue eyes
on<00:03:35.750> the<00:03:35.840> other<00:03:35.959> hand<00:03:36.260> he's<00:03:37.190> much<00:03:37.609> stronger

00:03:39.059 --> 00:03:39.069 
on the other hand he's much stronger

00:03:39.069 --> 00:03:43.949 
on the other hand he's much stronger
he's<00:03:40.069> more<00:03:40.940> ruthless<00:03:41.660> he's<00:03:41.840> less<00:03:42.049> merciful

00:03:43.949 --> 00:03:43.959 
he's more ruthless he's less merciful

00:03:43.959 --> 00:03:46.599 
he's more ruthless he's less merciful
and<00:03:44.959> like<00:03:45.170> I<00:03:45.290> said<00:03:45.530> at<00:03:45.650> the<00:03:45.709> beginning<00:03:45.829> boys

00:03:46.599 --> 00:03:46.609 
and like I said at the beginning boys

00:03:46.609 --> 00:03:48.220 
and like I said at the beginning boys
would<00:03:46.880> rush<00:03:47.480> in<00:03:47.690> and<00:03:47.840> try<00:03:47.930> to<00:03:47.989> overpower

00:03:48.220 --> 00:03:48.230 
would rush in and try to overpower

00:03:48.230 --> 00:03:52.210 
would rush in and try to overpower
Charizard<00:03:48.829> as<00:03:48.950> quick<00:03:49.190> as<00:03:49.340> he<00:03:49.430> can<00:03:50.200> so<00:03:51.220> either

00:03:52.210 --> 00:03:52.220 
Charizard as quick as he can so either

00:03:52.220 --> 00:03:56.319 
Charizard as quick as he can so either
way<00:03:52.720> these<00:03:53.720> two<00:03:54.489> their<00:03:55.489> strengths<00:03:56.209> and

00:03:56.319 --> 00:03:56.329 
way these two their strengths and

00:03:56.329 --> 00:04:03.420 
way these two their strengths and
weaknesses<00:03:57.260> are<00:03:57.590> all<00:03:59.470> basically<00:04:00.470> the<00:04:00.620> same

00:04:03.420 --> 00:04:03.430 

00:04:03.430 --> 00:04:08.190 

so<00:04:04.260> even<00:04:05.260> that<00:04:05.379> standpoint<00:04:06.250> I<00:04:07.019> can't<00:04:08.019> really

00:04:08.190 --> 00:04:08.200 
so even that standpoint I can't really

00:04:08.200 --> 00:04:10.589 
so even that standpoint I can't really
say<00:04:08.650> which<00:04:09.220> would<00:04:09.400> have<00:04:09.579> an<00:04:09.760> edge<00:04:10.000> strength

00:04:10.589 --> 00:04:10.599 
say which would have an edge strength

00:04:10.599 --> 00:04:12.690 
say which would have an edge strength
wise<00:04:10.870> although<00:04:11.739> I<00:04:11.829> still<00:04:12.010> have<00:04:12.129> a<00:04:12.189> slight<00:04:12.519> edge

00:04:12.690 --> 00:04:12.700 
wise although I still have a slight edge

00:04:12.700 --> 00:04:17.490 
wise although I still have a slight edge
because<00:04:13.329> he<00:04:13.510> is<00:04:13.629> bigger<00:04:13.959> after<00:04:14.530> all<00:04:15.930> now<00:04:16.930> there

00:04:17.490 --> 00:04:17.500 
because he is bigger after all now there

00:04:17.500 --> 00:04:20.129 
because he is bigger after all now there
is<00:04:17.650> one<00:04:17.979> thing<00:04:18.340> that<00:04:18.370> Charizard<00:04:19.000> has<00:04:19.780> that

00:04:20.129 --> 00:04:20.139 
is one thing that Charizard has that

00:04:20.139 --> 00:04:23.850 
is one thing that Charizard has that
Blois<00:04:20.410> doesn't<00:04:21.570> Charizard<00:04:22.570> has<00:04:22.960> multiple

00:04:23.850 --> 00:04:23.860 
Blois doesn't Charizard has multiple

00:04:23.860 --> 00:04:26.790 
Blois doesn't Charizard has multiple
moves<00:04:24.190> that<00:04:25.120> he<00:04:25.600> can<00:04:25.870> not<00:04:26.199> that<00:04:26.560> he<00:04:26.650> could

00:04:26.790 --> 00:04:26.800 
moves that he can not that he could

00:04:26.800 --> 00:04:30.990 
moves that he can not that he could
learn<00:04:28.050> throughout<00:04:29.340> the<00:04:30.340> generations<00:04:30.940> of

00:04:30.990 --> 00:04:31.000 
learn throughout the generations of

00:04:31.000 --> 00:04:34.670 
learn throughout the generations of
Pokemon<00:04:31.500> blue<00:04:32.500> eyes<00:04:32.710> from<00:04:33.490> all<00:04:33.639> the<00:04:33.759> yugioh

Pokemon blue eyes from all the yugioh
seasons<00:04:35.680> has<00:04:36.160> always<00:04:36.430> only<00:04:36.820> had<00:04:37.150> one<00:04:37.389> attack

00:04:37.740 --> 00:04:37.750

white<00:04:38.470> lightning

00:04:39.240 --> 00:04:39.250 
white lightning

00:04:39.250 --> 00:04:41.550 
white lightning
but<00:04:40.240> even<00:04:40.600> though<00:04:40.660> I<00:04:40.690> said<00:04:41.020> the<00:04:41.139> beginning<00:04:41.289> he

00:04:41.550 --> 00:04:41.560 
but even though I said the beginning he

00:04:41.560 --> 00:04:42.719 
but even though I said the beginning he
might<00:04:41.680> be<00:04:41.770> able<00:04:41.860> to<00:04:41.919> use<00:04:42.070> his<00:04:42.220> claws<00:04:42.430> in<00:04:42.610> his

00:04:42.719 --> 00:04:42.729 
might be able to use his claws in his

00:04:42.729 --> 00:04:44.909 
might be able to use his claws in his
tail<00:04:42.970> as<00:04:43.120> well<00:04:43.150> all<00:04:43.960> dragons<00:04:44.590> would<00:04:44.680> do<00:04:44.800> that

00:04:44.909 --> 00:04:44.919 
tail as well all dragons would do that

00:04:44.919 --> 00:04:47.129 
tail as well all dragons would do that
I'm<00:04:45.789> sure<00:04:46.030> he'd<00:04:46.180> bite<00:04:46.419> him<00:04:46.570> as<00:04:46.630> well<00:04:46.840> if<00:04:47.020> he

00:04:47.129 --> 00:04:47.139 
I'm sure he'd bite him as well if he

00:04:47.139 --> 00:04:50.420 
I'm sure he'd bite him as well if he
couldn't<00:04:47.560> blast<00:04:47.860> him<00:04:48.160> into<00:04:48.220> oblivion<00:04:49.350> but

00:04:50.420 --> 00:04:50.430 
couldn't blast him into oblivion but

00:04:50.430 --> 00:04:53.010 
couldn't blast him into oblivion but
Charizard<00:04:51.430> is<00:04:51.669> gonna<00:04:51.850> have<00:04:51.970> more<00:04:52.360> moves<00:04:52.720> that

00:04:53.010 --> 00:04:53.020 
Charizard is gonna have more moves that

00:04:53.020 --> 00:04:55.980 
Charizard is gonna have more moves that
he<00:04:53.169> could<00:04:53.320> learn<00:04:54.270> so<00:04:55.270> he's<00:04:55.449> gonna<00:04:55.599> have<00:04:55.690> more

00:04:55.980 --> 00:04:55.990
