on the estimated delivery time of the
unlock<00:01:24.689> I'd<00:01:24.930> advise<00:01:25.320> going<00:01:25.619> over<00:01:25.770> to<00:01:25.860> the

00:01:25.940 --> 00:01:25.950 
unlock I'd advise going over to the

00:01:25.950 --> 00:01:27.890 
unlock I'd advise going over to the
website<00:01:26.310> and<00:01:26.520> checking<00:01:27.119> the<00:01:27.210> price<00:01:27.390> of<00:01:27.600> your

website and checking the price of your
model<00:01:28.320> that's<00:01:28.860> probably<00:01:29.220> the<00:01:29.310> best<00:01:29.490> way

00:01:29.660 --> 00:01:29.670 
model that's probably the best way

00:01:29.670 --> 00:01:31.609 
model that's probably the best way
because<00:01:29.850> prices<00:01:30.450> can<00:01:30.659> vary<00:01:30.689> and<00:01:31.140> then<00:01:31.470> you'll
