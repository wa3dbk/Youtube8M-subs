00:00:00.370 --> 00:00:07.870
 Hello, I will explain to you today how 

00:00:04.890 --> 00:00:10.660
 having an apple computer and 

00:00:07.870 --> 00:00:12.540
 virtualizing windows 7 we can do 

00:00:10.660 --> 00:00:16.800
 that these two operating systems 

00:00:12.540 --> 00:00:20.110
 live in the same graphical interface 

00:00:16.800 --> 00:00:22.630
 Apple OS 

00:00:20.110 --> 00:00:26.050
 but keep that I have installed the 

00:00:22.630 --> 00:00:28.150
 vm guard application and merger with which 

00:00:26.050 --> 00:00:30.400
 I have virtualized currently windows 7 

00:00:28.150 --> 00:00:35.770
 if we go here on the top 

00:00:30.400 --> 00:00:38.050
 we can see how I have icons that 

00:00:35.770 --> 00:00:39.820
 they are not typical of mac and if they are of 

00:00:38.050 --> 00:00:41.260
 windows here we have the antivirus that 

00:00:39.820 --> 00:00:42.750
 is using windows 7 in these 

00:00:41.260 --> 00:00:47.220
 moments 

00:00:42.750 --> 00:00:49.530
 I can access this menu of only 7 that 

00:00:47.220 --> 00:00:51.250
 would be a little the menu of 

00:00:49.530 --> 00:00:55.120
 start 

00:00:51.250 --> 00:00:58.190
 and if you notice, I can access 

00:00:55.120 --> 00:01:01.690
 internet explorer 

00:00:58.190 --> 00:01:01.690
 you have the icon below 

00:01:05.960 --> 00:01:09.610
 and the system works perfectly 

00:01:10.210 --> 00:01:14.970
 we can also access my documents 

00:01:16.530 --> 00:01:22.730
 and we can do any kind 

00:01:20.150 --> 00:01:25.730
 of indexing between the two systems 

00:01:22.730 --> 00:01:28.340
 operatives fix that this image that 

00:01:25.730 --> 00:01:31.180
 I have here on my mac desk can 

00:01:28.340 --> 00:01:33.760
 bring it to windows 7 

00:01:31.180 --> 00:01:36.420
 and it would be part of the thousand folder 

00:01:33.760 --> 00:01:36.420
 documents 

00:01:37.170 --> 00:01:43.740
 well it's a way this kind of view is 

00:01:40.650 --> 00:01:46.890
 flame we can observe it here it's called 

00:01:43.740 --> 00:01:51.930
 view unit and as I said earlier 

00:01:46.890 --> 00:01:55.590
 allows us to access the 

00:01:51.930 --> 00:01:59.729
 windows7 operating system without losing the 

00:01:55.590 --> 00:02:03.600
 environment of the graphic environment that has 

00:01:59.729 --> 00:02:05.670
 apple you can see that I can access 

00:02:03.600 --> 00:02:09.700
 all documents even with 

00:02:05.670 --> 00:02:16.739
 same sounds that windows 7 would have 

00:02:09.700 --> 00:02:16.739
 but working with the operating system
