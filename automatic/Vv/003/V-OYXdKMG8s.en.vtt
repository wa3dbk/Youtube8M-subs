that<00:00:30.119> if<00:00:30.390> you<00:00:30.630> plug<00:00:31.050> in<00:00:31.080> something<00:00:31.529> it's<00:00:31.650> got

00:00:31.820 --> 00:00:31.830 
that if you plug in something it's got

00:00:31.830 --> 00:00:33.979 
that if you plug in something it's got
the<00:00:32.009> negative<00:00:32.940> on<00:00:33.090> the<00:00:33.210> outside<00:00:33.630> and<00:00:33.870> the

positive<00:00:34.410> on<00:00:34.590> the<00:00:34.920> middle<00:00:35.280> you<00:00:36.180> could<00:00:36.360> damage

00:00:36.560 --> 00:00:36.570 
positive on the middle you could damage

00:00:36.570 --> 00:00:39.500 
positive on the middle you could damage
the<00:00:36.870> effect<00:00:37.230> so<00:00:38.070> to<00:00:38.100> get<00:00:38.820> around<00:00:39.059> this<00:00:39.239> you<00:00:39.450> add

00:00:39.500 --> 00:00:39.510 
the effect so to get around this you add

00:00:39.510 --> 00:00:41.209 
the effect so to get around this you add
reverse<00:00:40.079> polarity<00:00:40.350> protection<00:00:40.620> I'm<00:00:41.040> going<00:00:41.160> to

reverse polarity protection I'm going to

00:00:41.219 --> 00:00:42.650 
reverse polarity protection I'm going to
be<00:00:41.280> going<00:00:41.550> over<00:00:41.850> a<00:00:41.879> couple<00:00:42.030> of<00:00:42.210> options<00:00:42.360> that

00:00:42.650 --> 00:00:42.660 
be going over a couple of options that

00:00:42.660 --> 00:00:45.680 
be going over a couple of options that
you<00:00:42.750> can<00:00:42.870> do<00:00:43.250> to<00:00:44.250> protect<00:00:44.610> the<00:00:45.000> guitar<00:00:45.390> pedal

00:00:45.680 --> 00:00:45.690 
you can do to protect the guitar pedal

00:00:45.690 --> 00:00:47.900 
you can do to protect the guitar pedal
from<00:00:45.750> this<00:00:45.989> and<00:00:46.800> and<00:00:47.190> the<00:00:47.370> positives<00:00:47.850> and

00:00:47.900 --> 00:00:47.910 
from this and and the positives and

00:00:47.910 --> 00:00:51.049 
from this and and the positives and
negatives<00:00:48.000> to<00:00:49.039> two<00:00:50.039> ways<00:00:50.250> to<00:00:50.489> do<00:00:50.610> it<00:00:50.640> and<00:00:50.910> the

00:00:51.049 --> 00:00:51.059 
negatives to two ways to do it and the

00:00:51.059 --> 00:00:53.600 
negatives to two ways to do it and the
positives<00:00:51.480> and<00:00:51.570> negatives<00:00:51.690> of<00:00:52.410> both<00:00:53.070> ways<00:00:53.309> I

00:00:53.600 --> 00:00:53.610 
positives and negatives of both ways I

00:00:53.610 --> 00:00:55.580 
positives and negatives of both ways I
note<00:00:54.270> elementary<00:00:54.870> stuff<00:00:55.110> but<00:00:55.289> I'm<00:00:55.350> just<00:00:55.379> going

00:00:55.580 --> 00:00:55.590 
note elementary stuff but I'm just going

00:00:55.590 --> 00:00:57.770 
note elementary stuff but I'm just going
to<00:00:55.620> quickly<00:00:55.860> touch<00:00:56.129> on<00:00:56.370> what<00:00:56.520> a<00:00:56.550> diode<00:00:57.180> is<00:00:57.539> just

00:00:57.770 --> 00:00:57.780 
to quickly touch on what a diode is just

00:00:57.780 --> 00:00:59.170 
to quickly touch on what a diode is just
to<00:00:57.870> get<00:00:57.989> everyone<00:00:58.140> up<00:00:58.320> to<00:00:58.350> speed

00:00:59.170 --> 00:00:59.180 
to get everyone up to speed

00:00:59.180 --> 00:01:02.810 
to get everyone up to speed
basically<00:01:00.180> they<00:01:00.390> look<00:01:00.570> like<00:01:00.750> this<00:01:01.050> and<00:01:01.820> they

00:01:02.810 --> 00:01:02.820 
basically they look like this and they

00:01:02.820 --> 00:01:04.579 
basically they look like this and they
have<00:01:02.969> a<00:01:03.000> white<00:01:03.239> band<00:01:03.570> on<00:01:03.840> one<00:01:04.049> side<00:01:04.350> hopefully

00:01:04.579 --> 00:01:04.589 
have a white band on one side hopefully

00:01:04.589 --> 00:01:06.200 
have a white band on one side hopefully
you<00:01:04.739> can<00:01:04.799> see<00:01:04.949> that<00:01:05.100> in<00:01:05.189> the<00:01:05.250> video<00:01:05.489> the<00:01:06.030> white

00:01:06.200 --> 00:01:06.210 
you can see that in the video the white

00:01:06.210 --> 00:01:09.800 
you can see that in the video the white
band<00:01:06.510> indicates<00:01:07.500> the<00:01:08.240> the<00:01:09.240> cathode<00:01:09.780> I

00:01:09.800 --> 00:01:09.810 
band indicates the the cathode I

00:01:09.810 --> 00:01:11.120 
band indicates the the cathode I
shouldn't<00:01:10.290> say<00:01:10.380> white<00:01:10.650> band<00:01:10.920> because

00:01:11.120 --> 00:01:11.130 
shouldn't say white band because

00:01:11.130 --> 00:01:12.590 
shouldn't say white band because
something<00:01:11.369> actually<00:01:11.520> have<00:01:11.729> a<00:01:11.790> black<00:01:12.000> band<00:01:12.299> so

00:01:12.590 --> 00:01:12.600 
something actually have a black band so

00:01:12.600 --> 00:01:14.060 
something actually have a black band so
it's<00:01:12.720> pretty<00:01:12.869> much<00:01:12.990> just<00:01:13.110> the<00:01:13.409> side<00:01:13.680> that<00:01:13.920> the

00:01:14.060 --> 00:01:14.070 
it's pretty much just the side that the

00:01:14.070 --> 00:01:16.820 
it's pretty much just the side that the
band<00:01:14.340> is<00:01:14.670> on<00:01:14.850> is<00:01:15.600> the<00:01:15.780> cathode<00:01:16.229> and<00:01:16.500> the<00:01:16.710> other

00:01:16.820 --> 00:01:16.830 
band is on is the cathode and the other

00:01:16.830 --> 00:01:19.999 
band is on is the cathode and the other
side<00:01:17.070> is<00:01:17.340> the<00:01:17.520> anode<00:01:17.880> and<00:01:18.180> basically<00:01:19.009> it's

00:01:19.999 --> 00:01:20.009 
side is the anode and basically it's

00:01:20.009 --> 00:01:22.789 
side is the anode and basically it's
kind<00:01:20.369> of<00:01:20.490> like<00:01:20.729> a<00:01:21.049> one-way<00:01:22.049> street<00:01:22.080> for

00:01:22.789 --> 00:01:22.799 
kind of like a one-way street for

00:01:22.799 --> 00:01:25.820 
kind of like a one-way street for
voltage<00:01:23.369> or<00:01:23.700> for<00:01:23.850> current<00:01:24.150> if<00:01:24.840> you<00:01:25.020> if<00:01:25.320> I<00:01:25.470> put<00:01:25.500> a

00:01:25.820 --> 00:01:25.830 
voltage or for current if you if I put a

00:01:25.830 --> 00:01:29.539 
voltage or for current if you if I put a
9-volt<00:01:26.400> battery<00:01:26.850> on<00:01:27.090> this<00:01:28.020> diode<00:01:28.920> and<00:01:29.280> I<00:01:29.340> have

00:01:29.539 --> 00:01:29.549 
9-volt battery on this diode and I have

00:01:29.549 --> 00:01:34.190 
9-volt battery on this diode and I have
a<00:01:30.390> plus<00:01:30.900> on<00:01:31.200> the<00:01:31.619> on<00:01:31.890> the<00:01:32.520> the<00:01:32.939> the<00:01:33.509> band<00:01:33.780> side

00:01:34.190 --> 00:01:34.200 
a plus on the on the the the band side

00:01:34.200 --> 00:01:37.399 
a plus on the on the the the band side
and<00:01:34.560> a<00:01:34.890> negative<00:01:35.400> on<00:01:35.579> the<00:01:35.610> other<00:01:35.759> side<00:01:36.200> it<00:01:37.200> will

00:01:37.399 --> 00:01:37.409 
and a negative on the other side it will

00:01:37.409 --> 00:01:39.080 
and a negative on the other side it will
basically<00:01:38.040> block<00:01:38.310> the<00:01:38.549> voltage<00:01:38.909> the<00:01:39.060> voltage

00:01:39.080 --> 00:01:39.090 
basically block the voltage the voltage

00:01:39.090 --> 00:01:40.940 
basically block the voltage the voltage
the<00:01:39.659> current<00:01:39.960> won't<00:01:40.259> flow<00:01:40.530> through<00:01:40.799> the<00:01:40.920> diode

00:01:40.940 --> 00:01:40.950 
the current won't flow through the diode

00:01:40.950 --> 00:01:42.590 
the current won't flow through the diode
but<00:01:41.340> if<00:01:41.460> I<00:01:41.549> reverse<00:01:41.850> it<00:01:42.030> the<00:01:42.119> other<00:01:42.210> way<00:01:42.329> around

00:01:42.590 --> 00:01:42.600 
but if I reverse it the other way around

00:01:42.600 --> 00:01:45.139 
but if I reverse it the other way around
it<00:01:42.899> will<00:01:43.259> so<00:01:43.619> it's<00:01:43.920> kind<00:01:44.130> of<00:01:44.189> yeah<00:01:44.700> it's<00:01:44.970> kind

00:01:45.139 --> 00:01:45.149 
it will so it's kind of yeah it's kind

00:01:45.149 --> 00:01:48.530 
it will so it's kind of yeah it's kind
of<00:01:45.180> like<00:01:45.329> will<00:01:45.840> only<00:01:46.079> let<00:01:46.880> like<00:01:47.880> if<00:01:48.090> you<00:01:48.210> if<00:01:48.450> you

00:01:48.530 --> 00:01:48.540 
of like will only let like if you if you

00:01:48.540 --> 00:01:50.090 
of like will only let like if you if you
think<00:01:48.720> of<00:01:48.810> it<00:01:48.899> as<00:01:49.020> water<00:01:49.320> I<00:01:49.500> will<00:01:49.649> only<00:01:49.770> let<00:01:49.950> the

00:01:50.090 --> 00:01:50.100 
think of it as water I will only let the

00:01:50.100 --> 00:01:53.389 
think of it as water I will only let the
water<00:01:50.310> flow<00:01:50.579> up<00:01:51.329> in<00:01:52.290> one<00:01:52.560> direction<00:01:52.740> won't<00:01:53.250> let

00:01:53.389 --> 00:01:53.399 
water flow up in one direction won't let

00:01:53.399 --> 00:01:55.819 
water flow up in one direction won't let
it<00:01:53.430> go<00:01:53.610> the<00:01:53.790> other<00:01:53.820> way<00:01:54.590> there's<00:01:55.590> a<00:01:55.649> very

00:01:55.819 --> 00:01:55.829 
it go the other way there's a very

00:01:55.829 --> 00:01:58.010 
it go the other way there's a very
simple<00:01:56.159> device<00:01:56.280> but<00:01:56.700> they<00:01:56.820> use<00:01:57.090> they<00:01:57.450> use<00:01:57.719> very

00:01:58.010 --> 00:01:58.020 
simple device but they use they use very

00:01:58.020 --> 00:01:59.600 
simple device but they use they use very
regularly<00:01:58.409> for<00:01:58.619> all<00:01:58.710> sorts<00:01:58.979> of<00:01:59.070> purposes<00:01:59.280> not

00:01:59.600 --> 00:01:59.610 
regularly for all sorts of purposes not

00:01:59.610 --> 00:02:01.850 
regularly for all sorts of purposes not
just<00:01:59.850> for<00:02:00.000> this<00:02:00.090> so<00:02:00.990> here's<00:02:01.200> two<00:02:01.439> ways<00:02:01.649> that

00:02:01.850 --> 00:02:01.860 
just for this so here's two ways that

00:02:01.860 --> 00:02:04.609 
just for this so here's two ways that
you<00:02:01.979> can<00:02:02.130> protect<00:02:02.280> your<00:02:03.090> effect<00:02:03.659> from<00:02:04.020> reverse

00:02:04.609 --> 00:02:04.619 
you can protect your effect from reverse

00:02:04.619 --> 00:02:07.219 
you can protect your effect from reverse
polarity<00:02:04.979> in<00:02:05.850> this<00:02:06.090> in<00:02:06.390> this<00:02:06.780> first<00:02:07.049> example

00:02:07.219 --> 00:02:07.229 
polarity in this in this first example

00:02:07.229 --> 00:02:09.050 
polarity in this in this first example
you've<00:02:07.649> got<00:02:07.770> the<00:02:07.860> diode<00:02:08.190> connected<00:02:08.520> from<00:02:09.000> the

00:02:09.050 --> 00:02:09.060 
you've got the diode connected from the

00:02:09.060 --> 00:02:11.119 
you've got the diode connected from the
plus<00:02:09.450> and<00:02:09.810> the<00:02:10.080> negative<00:02:10.470> across<00:02:10.709> the<00:02:10.920> plus

00:02:11.119 --> 00:02:11.129 
plus and the negative across the plus

00:02:11.129 --> 00:02:12.809 
plus and the negative across the plus
and<00:02:11.310> the<00:02:11.370> negative<00:02:11.700> rails

00:02:12.809 --> 00:02:12.819 
and the negative rails

00:02:12.819 --> 00:02:14.489 
and the negative rails
when<00:02:12.999> the<00:02:13.180> effect<00:02:13.689> is<00:02:13.840> connected<00:02:14.319> correctly

00:02:14.489 --> 00:02:14.499 
when the effect is connected correctly

00:02:14.499 --> 00:02:17.190 
when the effect is connected correctly
in<00:02:15.219> the<00:02:15.700> in<00:02:15.999> the<00:02:16.209> way<00:02:16.329> that's<00:02:16.569> shown<00:02:16.810> here<00:02:16.840> with

00:02:17.190 --> 00:02:17.200 
in the in the way that's shown here with

00:02:17.200 --> 00:02:18.809 
in the in the way that's shown here with
the<00:02:17.260> plus<00:02:17.499> or<00:02:17.530> minus<00:02:17.739> in<00:02:18.159> this<00:02:18.280> in<00:02:18.579> this

00:02:18.809 --> 00:02:18.819 
the plus or minus in this in this

00:02:18.819 --> 00:02:21.390 
the plus or minus in this in this
configuration<00:02:19.230> the<00:02:20.230> current<00:02:20.859> won't<00:02:21.099> flow

00:02:21.390 --> 00:02:21.400 
configuration the current won't flow

00:02:21.400 --> 00:02:22.860 
configuration the current won't flow
through<00:02:21.639> the<00:02:21.730> diode<00:02:21.760> it's<00:02:22.180> basically<00:02:22.540> like<00:02:22.719> an

00:02:22.860 --> 00:02:22.870 
through the diode it's basically like an

00:02:22.870 --> 00:02:24.360 
through the diode it's basically like an
open<00:02:23.079> circuit<00:02:23.499> and<00:02:23.590> we'll<00:02:24.069> just<00:02:24.219> continue

00:02:24.360 --> 00:02:24.370 
open circuit and we'll just continue

00:02:24.370 --> 00:02:25.949 
open circuit and we'll just continue
under<00:02:24.730> the<00:02:24.909> effect<00:02:25.239> and<00:02:25.389> the<00:02:25.480> effect<00:02:25.510> will

00:02:25.949 --> 00:02:25.959 
under the effect and the effect will

00:02:25.959 --> 00:02:27.899 
under the effect and the effect will
work<00:02:26.170> the<00:02:26.349> way<00:02:26.469> that<00:02:26.499> it's<00:02:26.769> supposed<00:02:26.859> to<00:02:27.249> but

00:02:27.899 --> 00:02:27.909 
work the way that it's supposed to but

00:02:27.909 --> 00:02:29.160 
work the way that it's supposed to but
if<00:02:27.999> you<00:02:28.090> swap<00:02:28.299> these<00:02:28.480> two<00:02:28.540> around<00:02:28.959> to<00:02:29.079> the

00:02:29.160 --> 00:02:29.170 
if you swap these two around to the

00:02:29.170 --> 00:02:30.479 
if you swap these two around to the
pluck<00:02:29.409> the<00:02:29.650> pluses<00:02:30.010> on<00:02:30.099> the<00:02:30.159> bottom<00:02:30.370> of<00:02:30.400> the

00:02:30.479 --> 00:02:30.489 
pluck the pluses on the bottom of the

00:02:30.489 --> 00:02:33.330 
pluck the pluses on the bottom of the
negs<00:02:30.700> negatives<00:02:31.389> at<00:02:31.480> the<00:02:31.569> top<00:02:31.920> this<00:02:32.920> diodes

00:02:33.330 --> 00:02:33.340 
negs negatives at the top this diodes

00:02:33.340 --> 00:02:35.069 
negs negatives at the top this diodes
now<00:02:33.489> like<00:02:33.700> a<00:02:33.730> short<00:02:34.150> which<00:02:34.629> means<00:02:34.900> that

00:02:35.069 --> 00:02:35.079 
now like a short which means that

00:02:35.079 --> 00:02:36.660 
now like a short which means that
basically<00:02:35.560> all<00:02:36.010> the<00:02:36.159> current<00:02:36.430> will<00:02:36.489> flow

00:02:36.660 --> 00:02:36.670 
basically all the current will flow

00:02:36.670 --> 00:02:39.690 
basically all the current will flow
through<00:02:36.969> the<00:02:37.569> diode<00:02:37.599> and<00:02:38.139> out<00:02:38.590> back<00:02:39.459> to<00:02:39.669> the

00:02:39.690 --> 00:02:39.700 
through the diode and out back to the

00:02:39.700 --> 00:02:43.440 
through the diode and out back to the
power<00:02:40.150> supply<00:02:40.389> so<00:02:41.730> you'll<00:02:42.730> only<00:02:42.879> get<00:02:43.120> a<00:02:43.180> small

00:02:43.440 --> 00:02:43.450 
power supply so you'll only get a small

00:02:43.450 --> 00:02:46.289 
power supply so you'll only get a small
voltage<00:02:43.930> drop<00:02:44.319> across<00:02:44.499> the<00:02:44.799> effect<00:02:45.310> of<00:02:45.549> about

00:02:46.289 --> 00:02:46.299 
voltage drop across the effect of about

00:02:46.299 --> 00:02:49.319 
voltage drop across the effect of about
the<00:02:46.769> forward<00:02:47.769> voltage<00:02:47.950> drop<00:02:48.909> of<00:02:48.939> the<00:02:49.150> dive

00:02:49.319 --> 00:02:49.329 
the forward voltage drop of the dive

00:02:49.329 --> 00:02:51.420 
the forward voltage drop of the dive
which<00:02:49.599> is<00:02:49.750> usually<00:02:50.109> only<00:02:50.260> about<00:02:50.409> half<00:02:50.709> a<00:02:50.889> half

00:02:51.420 --> 00:02:51.430 
which is usually only about half a half

00:02:51.430 --> 00:02:54.599 
which is usually only about half a half
a<00:02:51.579> volt<00:02:51.819> and<00:02:52.319> usually<00:02:53.319> you<00:02:53.680> use<00:02:53.919> the<00:02:54.099> one<00:02:54.310> and

00:02:54.599 --> 00:02:54.609 
a volt and usually you use the one and

00:02:54.609 --> 00:02:57.839 
a volt and usually you use the one and

for double-o x-series theorem for this

00:02:57.849 --> 00:02:59.939 
for double-o x-series theorem for this
configuration<00:02:58.090> as<00:02:58.719> well<00:02:58.750> and<00:02:59.169> if<00:02:59.620> you're<00:02:59.799> new

00:02:59.939 --> 00:02:59.949 
configuration as well and if you're new

00:02:59.949 --> 00:03:01.589 
configuration as well and if you're new
to<00:02:59.980> guitar<00:03:00.400> pedals<00:03:00.699> you'll<00:03:00.790> see<00:03:01.000> that<00:03:01.180> used<00:03:01.419> a

00:03:01.589 --> 00:03:01.599 
to guitar pedals you'll see that used a

00:03:01.599 --> 00:03:05.309 
to guitar pedals you'll see that used a
lot<00:03:01.780> so<00:03:02.650> another<00:03:03.069> another<00:03:03.959> uncommon<00:03:04.959> way<00:03:05.139> of

00:03:05.309 --> 00:03:05.319 
lot so another another uncommon way of

00:03:05.319 --> 00:03:08.490 
lot so another another uncommon way of
doing<00:03:05.819> reverse<00:03:06.819> polarity<00:03:07.150> protection<00:03:07.569> is<00:03:08.379> to

00:03:08.490 --> 00:03:08.500 
doing reverse polarity protection is to

00:03:08.500 --> 00:03:10.740 
doing reverse polarity protection is to
actually<00:03:08.650> put<00:03:08.919> the<00:03:09.040> diode<00:03:09.280> on<00:03:09.609> the<00:03:10.180> plus<00:03:10.419> rail

00:03:10.740 --> 00:03:10.750 
actually put the diode on the plus rail

00:03:10.750 --> 00:03:13.800 
actually put the diode on the plus rail
as<00:03:11.409> it<00:03:11.709> as<00:03:11.859> I<00:03:11.889> as<00:03:12.370> I've<00:03:12.639> drawn<00:03:12.849> here<00:03:12.969> and<00:03:13.419> they

00:03:13.800 --> 00:03:13.810 
as it as I as I've drawn here and they

00:03:13.810 --> 00:03:15.449 
as it as I as I've drawn here and they
both<00:03:13.989> have<00:03:14.230> pros<00:03:14.469> and<00:03:14.709> cons<00:03:14.889> and<00:03:15.010> I'll<00:03:15.099> explain

00:03:15.449 --> 00:03:15.459 
both have pros and cons and I'll explain

00:03:15.459 --> 00:03:17.939 
both have pros and cons and I'll explain
to<00:03:15.519> you<00:03:15.669> which<00:03:16.139> the<00:03:17.139> pros<00:03:17.349> and<00:03:17.530> cons<00:03:17.680> of<00:03:17.769> both

00:03:17.939 --> 00:03:17.949 
to you which the pros and cons of both

00:03:17.949 --> 00:03:19.499 
to you which the pros and cons of both
once<00:03:18.250> I<00:03:18.340> explain<00:03:18.699> how<00:03:18.819> this<00:03:18.939> one<00:03:19.150> works

00:03:19.499 --> 00:03:19.509 
once I explain how this one works

00:03:19.509 --> 00:03:22.170 
once I explain how this one works
so<00:03:20.139> you've<00:03:20.259> got<00:03:20.409> the<00:03:20.500> plus<00:03:20.739> and<00:03:20.919> the<00:03:20.949> minus<00:03:21.180> in

00:03:22.170 --> 00:03:22.180 
so you've got the plus and the minus in

00:03:22.180 --> 00:03:23.580 
so you've got the plus and the minus in
the<00:03:22.659> correct<00:03:22.959> way<00:03:23.049> around

00:03:23.580 --> 00:03:23.590 
the correct way around

00:03:23.590 --> 00:03:25.439 
the correct way around
you've<00:03:24.099> got<00:03:24.220> the<00:03:24.310> plus<00:03:24.519> and<00:03:24.729> minus<00:03:25.000> here<00:03:25.209> so

00:03:25.439 --> 00:03:25.449 
you've got the plus and minus here so

00:03:25.449 --> 00:03:26.969 
you've got the plus and minus here so
the<00:03:25.569> diodes<00:03:25.900> basically<00:03:26.319> like<00:03:26.439> a<00:03:26.470> short<00:03:26.769> and

00:03:26.969 --> 00:03:26.979 
the diodes basically like a short and

00:03:26.979 --> 00:03:29.129 
the diodes basically like a short and
the<00:03:27.489> current<00:03:27.759> flows<00:03:27.970> to<00:03:28.239> the<00:03:28.419> effect<00:03:28.930> and<00:03:29.079> it

00:03:29.129 --> 00:03:29.139 
the current flows to the effect and it

00:03:29.139 --> 00:03:31.140 
the current flows to the effect and it
works<00:03:29.319> normally<00:03:29.829> you<00:03:30.189> swap<00:03:30.400> those<00:03:30.579> two<00:03:30.639> around

00:03:31.140 --> 00:03:31.150 
works normally you swap those two around

00:03:31.150 --> 00:03:33.149 
works normally you swap those two around
you've<00:03:31.509> got<00:03:31.599> the<00:03:31.689> need<00:03:31.900> at<00:03:32.139> the<00:03:32.199> top<00:03:32.409> now<00:03:32.620> the

00:03:33.149 --> 00:03:33.159 
you've got the need at the top now the

00:03:33.159 --> 00:03:35.849 
you've got the need at the top now the
diode<00:03:33.699> is<00:03:33.790> like<00:03:33.879> an<00:03:34.000> open<00:03:34.120> circuit<00:03:34.419> no<00:03:35.169> voltage

00:03:35.849 --> 00:03:35.859 
diode is like an open circuit no voltage

00:03:35.859 --> 00:03:38.009 
diode is like an open circuit no voltage
will<00:03:36.189> go<00:03:36.220> to<00:03:36.370> the<00:03:36.609> effect<00:03:36.970> and<00:03:37.239> the<00:03:37.989> effect

00:03:38.009 --> 00:03:38.019 
will go to the effect and the effect

00:03:38.019 --> 00:03:40.259 
will go to the effect and the effect
will<00:03:38.470> be<00:03:38.500> protected<00:03:39.129> from<00:03:39.280> the<00:03:39.699> reverse

00:03:40.259 --> 00:03:40.269 
will be protected from the reverse

00:03:40.269 --> 00:03:43.770

polarity<00:03:41.609> so<00:03:42.609> the<00:03:42.729> pros<00:03:42.939> and<00:03:43.120> cons<00:03:43.299> for<00:03:43.449> both

00:03:43.770 --> 00:03:43.780

00:03:43.780 --> 00:03:45.509 
polarity so the pros and cons for both
methods<00:03:44.049> firstly<00:03:44.769> the<00:03:44.889> advantage<00:03:45.280> of<00:03:45.400> this

00:03:45.509 --> 00:03:45.519 
methods firstly the advantage of this

00:03:45.519 --> 00:03:47.339 
methods firstly the advantage of this
method<00:03:45.729> is<00:03:46.000> that<00:03:46.060> you<00:03:46.269> get<00:03:46.359> the<00:03:46.509> full<00:03:46.689> 9<00:03:46.930> volts

00:03:47.339 --> 00:03:47.349 
method is that you get the full 9 volts

00:03:47.349 --> 00:03:49.379 
method is that you get the full 9 volts
to<00:03:47.500> your<00:03:47.620> effect<00:03:47.949> you<00:03:48.489> don't<00:03:48.699> get<00:03:48.909> the<00:03:49.030> full<00:03:49.180> 9

00:03:49.379 --> 00:03:49.389 
to your effect you don't get the full 9

00:03:49.389 --> 00:03:50.999 
to your effect you don't get the full 9
volts<00:03:49.720> to<00:03:49.870> your<00:03:50.049> effect<00:03:50.319> with<00:03:50.500> this<00:03:50.650> method

volts to your effect with this method

00:03:51.009 --> 00:03:52.860 
volts to your effect with this method
you<00:03:51.159> actually<00:03:51.669> lose<00:03:51.909> the<00:03:52.180> voltage<00:03:52.540> drop<00:03:52.840> of

00:03:52.860 --> 00:03:52.870 
you actually lose the voltage drop of

00:03:59.249 --> 00:03:59.259 
8 1 7 1 8 or 1 9 you only lose a small

amount of voltage and I actually showed

00:04:01.719 --> 00:04:04.099

ago that the the rectifier diodes the

00:04:09.430 --> 00:04:12.899

the iron five eight one seven one eight
or<00:04:13.150> one<00:04:13.269> nine<00:04:13.479> actually<00:04:13.840> only<00:04:14.049> you<00:04:14.349> only<00:04:14.500> lose

00:04:14.729 --> 00:04:14.739 
or one nine actually only you only lose

00:04:14.739 --> 00:04:15.990 
or one nine actually only you only lose
a<00:04:14.799> small<00:04:15.039> amount<00:04:15.340> and<00:04:15.459> from<00:04:15.669> memory<00:04:15.819> I<00:04:15.969> think

00:04:15.990 --> 00:04:16.000 
a small amount and from memory I think

00:04:16.000 --> 00:04:18.029 
a small amount and from memory I think
it's<00:04:16.269> about<00:04:16.509> point<00:04:17.169> one<00:04:17.289> or<00:04:17.320> point<00:04:17.469> two<00:04:17.799> of<00:04:17.829> a

00:04:18.029 --> 00:04:18.039 
it's about point one or point two of a

00:04:18.039 --> 00:04:19.439 
it's about point one or point two of a
volt<00:04:18.280> so<00:04:18.459> you<00:04:18.549> only<00:04:18.699> lose<00:04:18.880> a<00:04:18.940> very<00:04:19.209> small

00:04:19.439 --> 00:04:19.449 
volt so you only lose a very small

00:04:19.449 --> 00:04:21.599 
volt so you only lose a very small
amount<00:04:19.570> but<00:04:20.380> the<00:04:20.500> advantage<00:04:21.070> of<00:04:21.190> doing<00:04:21.400> it

00:04:21.599 --> 00:04:21.609 
amount but the advantage of doing it

00:04:21.609 --> 00:04:24.600 
amount but the advantage of doing it
this<00:04:21.669> way<00:04:21.789> over<00:04:22.479> so<00:04:23.169> of<00:04:23.380> method<00:04:23.860> two<00:04:24.279> over

00:04:24.600 --> 00:04:24.610 
this way over so of method two over

00:04:24.610 --> 00:04:26.760 
this way over so of method two over
method<00:04:24.760> one<00:04:25.120> is<00:04:25.419> that

00:04:26.760 --> 00:04:26.770 
method one is that

00:04:26.770 --> 00:04:30.150 
method one is that
if<00:04:27.009> you<00:04:27.280> reverse<00:04:28.000> bias<00:04:28.169> method<00:04:29.169> one<00:04:29.380> you<00:04:29.979> get

00:04:30.150 --> 00:04:30.160 
if you reverse bias method one you get

00:04:30.160 --> 00:04:32.550 
if you reverse bias method one you get
the<00:04:30.280> full<00:04:30.520> current<00:04:31.090> go<00:04:31.270> through<00:04:31.660> as<00:04:32.110> if<00:04:32.319> it<00:04:32.440> was

00:04:32.550 --> 00:04:32.560 
the full current go through as if it was

00:04:32.560 --> 00:04:34.080 
the full current go through as if it was
a<00:04:32.590> short<00:04:32.919> and<00:04:33.069> it<00:04:33.250> goes<00:04:33.400> back<00:04:33.639> to<00:04:33.819> the<00:04:33.940> power

00:04:34.080 --> 00:04:34.090 
a short and it goes back to the power

00:04:34.090 --> 00:04:36.540 
a short and it goes back to the power
supply<00:04:34.360> see<00:04:34.930> you<00:04:35.020> you<00:04:35.590> back<00:04:35.800> it's<00:04:36.009> almost<00:04:36.280> like

00:04:36.540 --> 00:04:36.550 
supply see you you back it's almost like

00:04:36.550 --> 00:04:38.909 
supply see you you back it's almost like

plus and minus of your power supply you

00:04:40.810 --> 00:04:43.559 
plus and minus of your power supply you
put<00:04:41.080> the<00:04:41.229> onus<00:04:41.470> back<00:04:41.949> on<00:04:42.130> the<00:04:42.250> power<00:04:42.490> supply<00:04:42.699> to

put the onus back on the power supply to

00:04:43.569 --> 00:04:45.480 
put the onus back on the power supply to
sort<00:04:43.930> the<00:04:44.050> problem<00:04:44.169> out<00:04:44.530> and<00:04:44.770> if<00:04:45.160> you've<00:04:45.280> got

00:04:45.480 --> 00:04:45.490 
sort the problem out and if you've got

00:04:45.490 --> 00:04:47.070 
sort the problem out and if you've got
an<00:04:45.610> old<00:04:45.759> power<00:04:46.030> supply<00:04:46.389> or<00:04:46.630> a<00:04:46.660> power<00:04:46.900> supply

00:04:47.070 --> 00:04:47.080 
an old power supply or a power supply

00:04:47.080 --> 00:04:48.960 
an old power supply or a power supply
that<00:04:47.380> doesn't<00:04:47.620> have<00:04:47.770> some<00:04:48.220> sort<00:04:48.250> of<00:04:48.490> internal

00:04:48.960 --> 00:04:48.970 
that doesn't have some sort of internal

00:04:48.970 --> 00:04:52.439 
that doesn't have some sort of internal
protection<00:04:49.389> against<00:04:49.960> shorting<00:04:50.470> you<00:04:50.860> could<00:04:51.449> go

00:04:52.439 --> 00:04:52.449 
protection against shorting you could go

00:04:52.449 --> 00:04:53.580 
protection against shorting you could go
down<00:04:52.569> the<00:04:52.720> guess<00:04:52.930> but<00:04:53.139> you<00:04:53.259> could<00:04:53.380> probably

00:04:53.580 --> 00:04:53.590 
down the guess but you could probably

00:04:53.590 --> 00:04:56.520 
down the guess but you could probably
burn<00:04:54.069> a<00:04:54.099> fuse<00:04:54.460> out<00:04:54.699> or<00:04:54.910> or<00:04:55.360> overheat<00:04:56.229> it<00:04:56.410> or

00:04:56.520 --> 00:04:56.530 
burn a fuse out or or overheat it or

00:04:56.530 --> 00:04:58.529 
burn a fuse out or or overheat it or
something<00:04:57.280> inside<00:04:57.520> it's<00:04:57.789> going<00:04:57.910> to<00:04:58.030> going<00:04:58.479> to

00:04:58.529 --> 00:04:58.539 
something inside it's going to going to

00:04:58.539 --> 00:04:59.909 
something inside it's going to going to
blow<00:04:58.720> like<00:04:58.990> a<00:04:59.020> cap<00:04:59.289> or<00:04:59.440> something<00:04:59.500> like<00:04:59.860> that

00:04:59.909 --> 00:04:59.919 
blow like a cap or something like that

00:04:59.919 --> 00:05:04.290 
blow like a cap or something like that
so<00:05:00.699> if<00:05:01.630> you've<00:05:01.900> got<00:05:02.110> a<00:05:02.349> suspect<00:05:03.190> power<00:05:03.940> supply

00:05:04.290 --> 00:05:04.300 
so if you've got a suspect power supply

00:05:04.300 --> 00:05:05.219 
so if you've got a suspect power supply
you're<00:05:04.449> actually<00:05:04.690> probably<00:05:04.990> better<00:05:05.139> off

00:05:05.219 --> 00:05:05.229 
you're actually probably better off

00:05:05.229 --> 00:05:07.529 
you're actually probably better off
doing<00:05:05.500> this<00:05:06.159> method<00:05:06.460> of<00:05:06.789> reverse<00:05:07.330> polarity

00:05:07.529 --> 00:05:07.539 
doing this method of reverse polarity

00:05:07.539 --> 00:05:12.689 
doing this method of reverse polarity
over<00:05:08.229> this<00:05:08.349> one<00:05:09.750> so<00:05:10.750> lucky<00:05:11.050> for<00:05:11.319> me<00:05:11.680> my<00:05:11.949> passive

00:05:12.689 --> 00:05:12.699 
over this one so lucky for me my passive

00:05:12.699 --> 00:05:13.649 
over this one so lucky for me my passive
player<00:05:12.819> has<00:05:12.970> some<00:05:13.210> sort<00:05:13.449> of<00:05:13.509> internal

00:05:13.649 --> 00:05:13.659 
player has some sort of internal

00:05:17.100 --> 00:05:17.110 
protection as you can see these these

protection as you can see these these
spikes<00:05:17.560> are<00:05:17.860> the<00:05:18.099> power<00:05:18.639> supply<00:05:19.259> detecting

00:05:20.249 --> 00:05:20.259 
spikes are the power supply detecting

00:05:20.259 --> 00:05:21.870 
spikes are the power supply detecting
that<00:05:20.380> there's<00:05:20.530> a<00:05:20.590> short<00:05:20.889> and<00:05:21.159> switching<00:05:21.759> off

00:05:21.870 --> 00:05:21.880 
that there's a short and switching off

00:05:21.880 --> 00:05:24.149 
that there's a short and switching off
pretty<00:05:22.120> much<00:05:22.210> so<00:05:23.050> it<00:05:23.319> really<00:05:23.500> depends<00:05:23.889> on<00:05:24.039> your

00:05:24.149 --> 00:05:24.159 
pretty much so it really depends on your

00:05:24.159 --> 00:05:26.969 
pretty much so it really depends on your
power<00:05:24.430> supply<00:05:24.819> if<00:05:25.810> it's<00:05:26.110> not<00:05:26.349> very<00:05:26.650> good<00:05:26.860> if

00:05:26.969 --> 00:05:26.979 
power supply if it's not very good if

00:05:26.979 --> 00:05:28.499 
power supply if it's not very good if
it's<00:05:27.130> really<00:05:27.490> bad<00:05:27.699> it<00:05:27.940> might<00:05:28.030> not<00:05:28.210> have<00:05:28.330> any

00:05:28.499 --> 00:05:28.509 
it's really bad it might not have any

00:05:28.509 --> 00:05:30.240 
it's really bad it might not have any
internal<00:05:28.900> protection<00:05:29.470> and<00:05:29.620> you<00:05:30.099> know<00:05:30.130> you

00:05:30.240 --> 00:05:30.250 
internal protection and you know you

00:05:30.250 --> 00:05:31.709 
internal protection and you know you
might<00:05:30.400> end<00:05:30.430> up<00:05:30.610> having<00:05:30.759> issues<00:05:31.270> with<00:05:31.479> them

00:05:31.709 --> 00:05:31.719 
might end up having issues with them

00:05:31.719 --> 00:05:33.839 
might end up having issues with them
with<00:05:32.560> this<00:05:32.770> method<00:05:33.159> if<00:05:33.250> you<00:05:33.280> plug<00:05:33.550> it<00:05:33.669> in<00:05:33.759> the

00:05:33.839 --> 00:05:33.849 
with this method if you plug it in the

00:05:33.849 --> 00:05:36.209 
with this method if you plug it in the
wrong<00:05:34.030> way<00:05:34.060> and<00:05:34.419> you<00:05:35.229> probably<00:05:35.949> want<00:05:36.190> to

00:05:36.209 --> 00:05:36.219 
wrong way and you probably want to

00:05:36.219 --> 00:05:38.279 
wrong way and you probably want to
unplug<00:05:36.520> it<00:05:36.699> quickly<00:05:37.240> otherwise<00:05:37.419> it<00:05:37.630> might<00:05:37.780> you

00:05:38.279 --> 00:05:38.289 
unplug it quickly otherwise it might you

00:05:38.289 --> 00:05:39.659 
unplug it quickly otherwise it might you
know<00:05:38.409> overheat<00:05:38.949> or<00:05:39.130> you<00:05:39.310> might<00:05:39.490> damage

00:05:39.659 --> 00:05:39.669 
know overheat or you might damage

00:05:39.669 --> 00:05:42.450 
know overheat or you might damage
something<00:05:40.500> so<00:05:41.500> what<00:05:41.620> happens<00:05:41.830> if<00:05:41.949> you<00:05:42.070> have<00:05:42.190> a

00:05:42.450 --> 00:05:42.460 
something so what happens if you have a

00:05:42.460 --> 00:05:44.790 
something so what happens if you have a
pedal<00:05:43.419> that<00:05:43.570> you<00:05:43.719> don't<00:05:44.020> have<00:05:44.169> reverse

00:05:44.790 --> 00:05:44.800 
pedal that you don't have reverse

00:05:44.800 --> 00:05:46.140 
pedal that you don't have reverse
polarity<00:05:45.039> protection<00:05:45.250> you<00:05:45.669> want<00:05:45.820> to<00:05:45.880> add<00:05:46.000> it

00:05:46.140 --> 00:05:46.150 
polarity protection you want to add it

00:05:46.150 --> 00:05:47.999 
polarity protection you want to add it
it's<00:05:46.419> very<00:05:46.630> simple<00:05:47.020> a<00:05:47.080> lot<00:05:47.199> of<00:05:47.259> people<00:05:47.590> do<00:05:47.830> this

00:05:47.999 --> 00:05:48.009 
it's very simple a lot of people do this

00:05:48.009 --> 00:05:50.129 
it's very simple a lot of people do this
if<00:05:48.789> they<00:05:48.880> want<00:05:49.000> to<00:05:49.090> add<00:05:49.240> it<00:05:49.389> to<00:05:49.419> it<00:05:49.659> you<00:05:49.990> just

00:05:50.129 --> 00:05:50.139 
if they want to add it to it you just

00:05:50.139 --> 00:05:52.080 
if they want to add it to it you just
you<00:05:50.440> just<00:05:50.469> solder<00:05:50.949> a<00:05:50.979> diode<00:05:51.280> from<00:05:51.490> the<00:05:51.639> plus<00:05:51.849> to

00:05:52.080 --> 00:05:52.090 
you just solder a diode from the plus to

00:05:52.090 --> 00:05:54.899 
you just solder a diode from the plus to
the<00:05:52.180> minus<00:05:52.509> and<00:05:53.500> in<00:05:54.009> the<00:05:54.130> configuration<00:05:54.580> in

00:05:54.899 --> 00:05:54.909 
the minus and in the configuration in

00:05:54.909 --> 00:05:57.659 
the minus and in the configuration in
the<00:05:55.090> orientation<00:05:56.050> I<00:05:56.110> showed<00:05:56.349> you<00:05:56.500> on<00:05:56.620> that<00:05:56.770> on

00:05:57.659 --> 00:05:57.669 
the orientation I showed you on that on

00:05:57.669 --> 00:05:59.939 
the orientation I showed you on that on
that<00:05:57.729> schematic<00:05:58.210> before<00:05:58.750> and<00:05:59.020> you've<00:05:59.620> got<00:05:59.830> it

00:05:59.939 --> 00:05:59.949 
that schematic before and you've got it

00:05:59.949 --> 00:06:01.020 
that schematic before and you've got it
if<00:06:00.159> you<00:06:00.250> want<00:06:00.400> to<00:06:00.460> do<00:06:00.550> it<00:06:00.669> the<00:06:00.759> other<00:06:00.789> way

00:06:01.020 --> 00:06:01.030 
if you want to do it the other way

00:06:01.030 --> 00:06:02.339 
if you want to do it the other way
around<00:06:01.060> where<00:06:01.419> it's<00:06:01.509> actually<00:06:01.630> in<00:06:01.930> line<00:06:02.169> with

00:06:02.339 --> 00:06:02.349 
around where it's actually in line with

00:06:02.349 --> 00:06:03.749 
around where it's actually in line with
the<00:06:02.440> plus<00:06:02.650> nine<00:06:02.919> volts<00:06:03.219> obviously<00:06:03.550> you<00:06:03.639> have

00:06:03.749 --> 00:06:03.759 
the plus nine volts obviously you have

00:06:03.759 --> 00:06:06.450 
the plus nine volts obviously you have
to<00:06:03.880> unsolder<00:06:04.180> from<00:06:04.870> the<00:06:04.960> DC<00:06:05.289> jack<00:06:05.590> and<00:06:05.770> put<00:06:06.400> it

00:06:06.450 --> 00:06:06.460 
to unsolder from the DC jack and put it

00:06:06.460 --> 00:06:07.890 
to unsolder from the DC jack and put it
in<00:06:06.580> line<00:06:06.729> with<00:06:06.759> the<00:06:07.030> plus<00:06:07.240> nine<00:06:07.449> volts<00:06:07.780> but

00:06:07.890 --> 00:06:07.900 
in line with the plus nine volts but

00:06:07.900 --> 00:06:10.830 
in line with the plus nine volts but
still<00:06:08.380> that's<00:06:08.500> not<00:06:08.650> very<00:06:08.770> hard<00:06:08.979> either<00:06:09.780> so<00:06:10.780> I

00:06:10.830 --> 00:06:10.840 
still that's not very hard either so I

00:06:10.840 --> 00:06:12.149 
still that's not very hard either so I
hope<00:06:10.960> you<00:06:11.080> liked<00:06:11.229> the<00:06:11.349> video<00:06:11.440> if<00:06:11.860> you<00:06:11.979> do<00:06:12.130> give
