00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:06.290
 Hi guys, how are you? We'll do the 

00:00:02.340 --> 00:00:06.290
 third 30 of nelson luiz de carvalho 

00:00:16.609 --> 00:00:21.090
 The film tells the story of Landmarks is a 

00:00:19.170 --> 00:00:23.070
 a 16-year-old teenager who discovers that 

00:00:21.090 --> 00:00:25.170
 He's gay, he ends up falling in love with a 

00:00:23.070 --> 00:00:27.300
 school colleague renato 

00:00:25.170 --> 00:00:29.369
 and then after facing all the dramas 

00:00:27.300 --> 00:00:31.679
 within yourself and also with the 

00:00:29.369 --> 00:00:34.440
 his family and they deceive 

00:00:31.679 --> 00:00:36.600
 dating romance that lasts several 

00:00:34.440 --> 00:00:39.239
 and several pages until the actress appears 

00:00:36.600 --> 00:00:41.700
 who was Renato's girlfriend when he 

00:00:39.239 --> 00:00:44.460
 pretending that he is straight and the girl 

00:00:41.700 --> 00:00:46.170
 destabilizing the romance of the two 

00:00:44.460 --> 00:00:48.329
 the story told by the landmarks and how in 

00:00:46.170 --> 00:00:50.370
 first person opens gap for us 

00:00:48.329 --> 00:00:51.719
 find out what the feelings and 

00:00:50.370 --> 00:00:52.890
 his thoughts 

00:00:51.719 --> 00:00:54.629
 The problem is that the thoughts and 

00:00:52.890 --> 00:00:56.070
 his feelings are always the same 

00:00:54.629 --> 00:00:57.600
 because situations are also 

00:00:56.070 --> 00:00:58.559
 practically the same in all 

00:00:57.600 --> 00:00:59.730
 chapters 

00:00:58.559 --> 00:01:01.949
 So the book ends up being very 

00:00:59.730 --> 00:01:03.390
 knows that the characters in this 

00:01:01.949 --> 00:01:05.010
 book are so stable 

00:01:03.390 --> 00:01:07.320
 he ended up changing a lot during the 

00:01:05.010 --> 00:01:08.909
 native for no reason at all they end up 

00:01:07.320 --> 00:01:09.600
 getting kind of incoherent for people who 

00:01:08.909 --> 00:01:11.460
 is going 

00:01:09.600 --> 00:01:13.140
 beginning with the landmarks that at the 

00:01:11.460 --> 00:01:14.250
 book in front of so much to be able to 

00:01:13.140 --> 00:01:15.840
 stay with renato 

00:01:14.250 --> 00:01:18.060
 and then when the beatrice appears he stays 

00:01:15.840 --> 00:01:19.740
 all swayed by her he did not like 

00:01:18.060 --> 00:01:20.610
 her at the beginning of the book she knows she does not 

00:01:19.740 --> 00:01:22.380
 no sense 

00:01:20.610 --> 00:01:23.970
 Another thing that got me lost in this 

00:01:22.380 --> 00:01:26.070
 book is that there is a lot that is 

00:01:23.970 --> 00:01:28.740
 here are the characters that have 

00:01:26.070 --> 00:01:31.049
 very prominent in beginning chapters 

00:01:28.740 --> 00:01:33.869
 but at the end they do not even appear 

00:01:31.049 --> 00:01:35.579
 You do not even know about him and the character 

00:01:33.869 --> 00:01:36.930
 also has flashbacks reminding 

00:01:35.579 --> 00:01:39.060
 events that add nothing 

00:01:36.930 --> 00:01:41.340
 to the story it seems that the actor was kind 

00:01:39.060 --> 00:01:43.320
 writing and did not come back to give a 

00:01:41.340 --> 00:01:44.250
 second look you know but the book is not 

00:01:43.320 --> 00:01:45.630
 all bad 

00:01:44.250 --> 00:01:48.479
 he has several messages of prejudice 

00:01:45.630 --> 00:01:50.070
 and ends up breaking several taboos and is very 

00:01:48.479 --> 00:01:53.130
 funny when his family tries 

00:01:50.070 --> 00:01:54.360
 cure the marks of his gay condition 

00:01:53.130 --> 00:01:57.030
 I can not say that the parties 

00:01:54.360 --> 00:01:59.070
 interesting were most outside final 

00:01:57.030 --> 00:02:02.000
 It was completely inconsistent with everything 

00:01:59.070 --> 00:02:04.439
 that appeared until then and for all that 

00:02:02.000 --> 00:02:06.990
 3030 will take two drills 

00:02:04.439 --> 00:02:09.090
 well then this is it if you liked click
