00:01:39.400 --> 00:01:39.410 
sierra mist slice it's pretty good I

00:01:39.410 --> 00:01:41.870 
sierra mist slice it's pretty good I
actually<00:01:40.410> give<00:01:40.710> the<00:01:40.890> nod<00:01:41.100> to<00:01:41.400> the<00:01:41.430> limeade

this is this is like mountain dew 7up so
out<00:01:44.790> of<00:01:44.820> these<00:01:45.030> two<00:01:45.300> I<00:01:45.330> personally<00:01:45.960> give<00:01:46.140> the

00:01:46.370 --> 00:01:46.380 
out of these two I personally give the

00:01:46.380 --> 00:01:48.800
