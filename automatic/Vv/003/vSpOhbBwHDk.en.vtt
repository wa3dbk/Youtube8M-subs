the<00:00:21.449> attributes<00:00:22.199> to<00:00:22.680> what<00:00:22.920> I<00:00:23.039> believe<00:00:23.100> they

00:00:23.689 --> 00:00:23.699 
the attributes to what I believe they

00:00:23.699 --> 00:00:26.089 
the attributes to what I believe they
should<00:00:23.760> be<00:00:24.119> I<00:00:24.300> marble<00:00:25.080> or<00:00:25.230> I<00:00:25.439> actually<00:00:25.560> missed

00:00:26.089 --> 00:00:26.099 
should be I marble or I actually missed

00:00:26.099 --> 00:00:28.040 
should be I marble or I actually missed
him<00:00:26.279> for<00:00:26.519> whatever<00:00:26.760> reason<00:00:27.240> so<00:00:27.359> his<00:00:27.570> rating

00:00:28.040 --> 00:00:28.050 
him for whatever reason so his rating

00:00:28.050 --> 00:00:30.230 
him for whatever reason so his rating
stays<00:00:28.320> the<00:00:28.470> same<00:00:28.650> so<00:00:28.920> I<00:00:29.460> just<00:00:29.820> want<00:00:29.939> to<00:00:30.000> make<00:00:30.060> it

00:00:30.230 --> 00:00:30.240 
stays the same so I just want to make it

00:00:30.240 --> 00:00:31.939 
stays the same so I just want to make it
clear<00:00:30.269> I'm<00:00:30.599> not<00:00:30.630> choosing<00:00:31.050> the<00:00:31.410> ratings<00:00:31.769> what

00:00:31.939 --> 00:00:31.949 
clear I'm not choosing the ratings what

00:00:31.949 --> 00:00:33.229 
clear I'm not choosing the ratings what
I<00:00:31.980> think<00:00:32.219> the<00:00:32.309> rating<00:00:32.610> should<00:00:32.730> be<00:00:32.910> just<00:00:33.120> two

00:00:33.229 --> 00:00:33.239 
I think the rating should be just two

00:00:33.239 --> 00:00:37.490 
I think the rating should be just two
attributes<00:00:34.579> one<00:00:35.579> example<00:00:35.899> would<00:00:36.899> be<00:00:36.960> Benzema

00:00:37.490 --> 00:00:37.500 
attributes one example would be Benzema

00:00:37.500 --> 00:00:39.680 
attributes one example would be Benzema
as<00:00:37.680> you<00:00:37.770> can<00:00:37.890> see<00:00:38.010> is<00:00:38.070> 86<00:00:38.670> I<00:00:38.910> suppose<00:00:39.329> that's<00:00:39.480> be

00:00:39.680 --> 00:00:39.690 
as you can see is 86 I suppose that's be

00:00:39.690 --> 00:00:42.080 
as you can see is 86 I suppose that's be
correct<00:00:40.020> but<00:00:40.280> yeah<00:00:41.280> like<00:00:41.610> I<00:00:41.640> said<00:00:41.850> I'm<00:00:41.940> not

00:00:42.080 --> 00:00:42.090 
correct but yeah like I said I'm not

00:00:42.090 --> 00:00:43.729 
correct but yeah like I said I'm not
choosing<00:00:42.329> the<00:00:42.629> ratings<00:00:42.960> like<00:00:43.140> I<00:00:43.260> think<00:00:43.530> are

00:00:43.729 --> 00:00:43.739 
choosing the ratings like I think are

00:00:43.739 --> 00:00:45.889 
choosing the ratings like I think are
below<00:00:44.040> should<00:00:44.190> be<00:00:44.250> 79<00:00:44.789> Pepe<00:00:45.149> should<00:00:45.329> be<00:00:45.420> 85

00:00:45.889 --> 00:00:45.899 
below should be 79 Pepe should be 85

00:00:45.899 --> 00:00:48.350 
below should be 79 Pepe should be 85
it's<00:00:46.890> just<00:00:47.100> I<00:00:47.250> change<00:00:47.550> the<00:00:47.730> attributes<00:00:47.850> and

00:00:48.350 --> 00:00:48.360 
it's just I change the attributes and

00:00:48.360 --> 00:00:50.209 
it's just I change the attributes and
the<00:00:48.570> rating<00:00:48.930> is<00:00:49.050> made<00:00:49.440> up<00:00:49.620> just<00:00:50.039> by<00:00:50.160> the

00:00:50.209 --> 00:00:50.219 
the rating is made up just by the

00:00:50.219 --> 00:00:51.439 
the rating is made up just by the
different<00:00:50.579> attributes<00:00:50.940> so<00:00:51.090> it's<00:00:51.210> not<00:00:51.300> like

00:00:51.439 --> 00:00:51.449 
different attributes so it's not like

00:00:51.449 --> 00:00:53.000 
different attributes so it's not like
I'm<00:00:51.539> actually<00:00:51.690> choosing<00:00:52.350> because<00:00:52.800> I<00:00:52.949> know

00:00:53.000 --> 00:00:53.010 
I'm actually choosing because I know

00:00:53.010 --> 00:00:54.709 
I'm actually choosing because I know
people<00:00:53.250> like<00:00:53.520> to<00:00:53.579> complain<00:00:53.730> a<00:00:54.120> lot<00:00:54.360> about<00:00:54.480> the

00:00:54.709 --> 00:00:54.719 
people like to complain a lot about the

00:00:54.719 --> 00:00:56.270 
people like to complain a lot about the
ratings<00:00:54.870> like<00:00:55.289> what<00:00:55.500> actually<00:00:55.800> the<00:00:55.890> rating<00:00:56.190> is

00:00:56.270 --> 00:00:56.280 
ratings like what actually the rating is

00:00:56.280 --> 00:00:58.279 
ratings like what actually the rating is
but<00:00:56.550> actually<00:00:57.239> see<00:00:57.420> I<00:00:57.449> moved<00:00:57.750> Pepe's

00:00:58.279 --> 00:00:58.289 
but actually see I moved Pepe's

00:00:58.289 --> 00:01:00.920 
but actually see I moved Pepe's
aggression<00:00:59.039> up<00:00:59.190> higher<00:00:59.399> 296<00:01:00.090> I<00:01:00.359> definitely

00:01:00.920 --> 00:01:00.930 
aggression up higher 296 I definitely

00:01:00.930 --> 00:01:02.270 
aggression up higher 296 I definitely
think<00:01:01.230> that's<00:01:01.440> correct<00:01:01.770> because<00:01:01.980> you<00:01:02.160> know

00:01:02.270 --> 00:01:02.280 
think that's correct because you know

00:01:02.280 --> 00:01:03.799 
think that's correct because you know
he's<00:01:02.489> a<00:01:02.520> very<00:01:02.579> aggressive<00:01:03.000> player<00:01:03.449> in<00:01:03.629> real

00:01:03.799 --> 00:01:03.809 
he's a very aggressive player in real

00:01:03.809 --> 00:01:05.750 
he's a very aggressive player in real
life<00:01:04.019> and<00:01:04.320> yeah<00:01:04.860> you<00:01:05.100> just<00:01:05.280> edit<00:01:05.640> the

00:01:05.750 --> 00:01:05.760 
life and yeah you just edit the

00:01:05.760 --> 00:01:07.730 
life and yeah you just edit the
attributes<00:01:06.240> and<00:01:06.479> that<00:01:06.900> makes<00:01:07.110> up<00:01:07.290> the<00:01:07.320> rating

00:01:07.730 --> 00:01:07.740 
attributes and that makes up the rating

00:01:07.740 --> 00:01:10.630 
attributes and that makes up the rating
I<00:01:07.799> know<00:01:07.860> like<00:01:08.189> I<00:01:08.280> said<00:01:08.460> I<00:01:08.610> know<00:01:08.909> people<00:01:09.240> like<00:01:09.570> to

actually are the key thing to how they

00:01:17.759 --> 00:01:19.850 
actually are the key thing to how they
play<00:01:17.970> in<00:01:18.180> the<00:01:18.299> game<00:01:18.479> and<00:01:18.750> also<00:01:19.380> with<00:01:19.500> Sergio

00:01:19.860 --> 00:01:22.249 
play in the game and also with Sergio
Ramos<00:01:20.040> I<00:01:20.430> made<00:01:21.030> his<00:01:21.180> pace<00:01:21.450> a<00:01:21.479> bit<00:01:21.630> high<00:01:21.900> if<00:01:22.140> you

00:01:22.249 --> 00:01:22.259 
Ramos I made his pace a bit high if you

00:01:22.259 --> 00:01:24.140 
Ramos I made his pace a bit high if you
saw<00:01:22.439> her<00:01:22.530> there<00:01:22.710> to<00:01:23.040> rot<00:01:23.070> yeah<00:01:23.790> to<00:01:23.970> what<00:01:24.119> I

00:01:24.140 --> 00:01:24.150 
saw her there to rot yeah to what I

00:01:24.150 --> 00:01:26.480 
saw her there to rot yeah to what I
really<00:01:24.509> that<00:01:24.720> deserves<00:01:25.530> I<00:01:25.830> think<00:01:26.159> it<00:01:26.310> should

00:01:26.480 --> 00:01:26.490 
really that deserves I think it should

00:01:26.490 --> 00:01:29.929 
really that deserves I think it should
be<00:01:26.729> he's<00:01:27.689> still<00:01:27.840> 85<00:01:28.170> overall<00:01:28.829> I<00:01:29.040> definitely

00:01:29.929 --> 00:01:29.939 
be he's still 85 overall I definitely

00:01:29.939 --> 00:01:31.550 
be he's still 85 overall I definitely
think<00:01:30.180> that's<00:01:30.390> a<00:01:30.479> good<00:01:30.630> overall<00:01:31.049> for<00:01:31.259> him<00:01:31.409> my

00:01:31.550 --> 00:01:31.560 
think that's a good overall for him my

00:01:31.560 --> 00:01:33.710 
think that's a good overall for him my
cell<00:01:31.770> 0<00:01:31.829> as<00:01:32.009> well<00:01:32.220> I<00:01:32.460> think<00:01:32.909> I<00:01:33.030> increased<00:01:33.509> his

00:01:33.710 --> 00:01:33.720 
cell 0 as well I think I increased his

00:01:33.720 --> 00:01:35.270 
cell 0 as well I think I increased his
pace<00:01:33.960> by<00:01:34.170> a<00:01:34.200> little<00:01:34.530> bit<00:01:34.650> I<00:01:34.680> think<00:01:34.799> he<00:01:35.100> was<00:01:35.250> a

00:01:35.270 --> 00:01:35.280 
pace by a little bit I think he was a

00:01:35.280 --> 00:01:37.700 
pace by a little bit I think he was a
bit<00:01:35.369> slower<00:01:35.930> not<00:01:36.930> by<00:01:37.049> too<00:01:37.110> much<00:01:37.350> just<00:01:37.560> by<00:01:37.680> a

00:01:37.700 --> 00:01:37.710 
bit slower not by too much just by a

00:01:37.710 --> 00:01:39.710 
bit slower not by too much just by a
little<00:01:37.950> bit<00:01:38.159> and<00:01:38.310> I<00:01:38.790> suppose<00:01:39.360> there's<00:01:39.570> going

00:01:39.710 --> 00:01:39.720 
little bit and I suppose there's going

00:01:39.720 --> 00:01:42.710 
little bit and I suppose there's going
to<00:01:39.780> be<00:01:39.810> different<00:01:40.520> arguments<00:01:41.520> to<00:01:41.939> what<00:01:42.450> people

00:01:42.710 --> 00:01:42.720 
to be different arguments to what people

00:01:42.720 --> 00:01:45.620 
to be different arguments to what people
think<00:01:42.869> um<00:01:43.460> yeah<00:01:44.460> because<00:01:44.759> that's<00:01:45.360> just

00:01:45.620 --> 00:01:45.630 
think um yeah because that's just

00:01:45.630 --> 00:01:47.510 
think um yeah because that's just
because<00:01:45.899> obviously<00:01:46.409> in<00:01:46.829> football<00:01:47.130> people

00:01:47.510 --> 00:01:47.520 
because obviously in football people

00:01:47.520 --> 00:01:49.249 
because obviously in football people
have<00:01:47.610> different<00:01:47.790> opinions<00:01:48.119> about<00:01:48.840> who's

00:01:49.249 --> 00:01:49.259 
have different opinions about who's

00:01:49.259 --> 00:01:51.289 
have different opinions about who's
better<00:01:49.290> and<00:01:49.860> what<00:01:50.189> they<00:01:50.310> should<00:01:50.490> be<00:01:50.700> but<00:01:50.939> if

00:01:51.289 --> 00:01:51.299 
better and what they should be but if

00:01:51.299 --> 00:01:53.359 
better and what they should be but if
you're<00:01:51.509> just<00:01:51.750> arguing<00:01:51.960> by<00:01:52.530> a<00:01:52.560> few<00:01:52.890> overall

00:01:53.359 --> 00:01:53.369 
you're just arguing by a few overall

00:01:53.369 --> 00:01:56.060 
you're just arguing by a few overall
points<00:01:53.899> yeah<00:01:54.899> it<00:01:55.350> doesn't<00:01:55.560> really<00:01:55.740> make<00:01:55.920> a<00:01:55.979> big

00:01:56.060 --> 00:01:56.070 
points yeah it doesn't really make a big

00:01:56.070 --> 00:01:57.980 
points yeah it doesn't really make a big
difference<00:01:56.399> that<00:01:56.729> attributes<00:01:57.240> is<00:01:57.450> what<00:01:57.780> is

00:01:57.980 --> 00:01:57.990 
difference that attributes is what is

00:01:57.990 --> 00:02:00.230 
difference that attributes is what is
most<00:01:58.320> important<00:01:58.950> because<00:01:59.490> if<00:01:59.790> you<00:01:59.880> see<00:02:00.030> in<00:02:00.119> the

00:02:00.230 --> 00:02:00.240 
most important because if you see in the

00:02:00.240 --> 00:02:02.569 
most important because if you see in the
game<00:02:00.420> if<00:02:00.659> you<00:02:00.990> compare<00:02:01.350> like<00:02:01.530> 82<00:02:02.070> overall

00:02:02.569 --> 00:02:02.579 
game if you compare like 82 overall

00:02:02.579 --> 00:02:04.639 
game if you compare like 82 overall
player<00:02:02.790> to<00:02:03.000> another<00:02:03.299> 82<00:02:03.840> overall<00:02:04.200> player<00:02:04.439> this

00:02:04.639 --> 00:02:04.649 
player to another 82 overall player this

00:02:04.649 --> 00:02:06.770 
player to another 82 overall player this
good<00:02:04.829> chance<00:02:05.100> one<00:02:05.700> of<00:02:05.850> them<00:02:06.000> is<00:02:06.030> considerably

00:02:06.770 --> 00:02:06.780 
good chance one of them is considerably

00:02:06.780 --> 00:02:09.290 
good chance one of them is considerably
better<00:02:07.079> than<00:02:07.259> the<00:02:07.560> other<00:02:07.710> one<00:02:07.920> so<00:02:08.160> here's<00:02:09.030> Sami

which<00:03:12.640> i<00:03:12.849> think<00:03:12.970> is<00:03:13.239> good<00:03:13.480> i<00:03:13.829> changed<00:03:14.829> some

00:03:15.000 --> 00:03:15.010 
which i think is good i changed some

00:03:15.010 --> 00:03:16.470 
which i think is good i changed some
skill<00:03:15.400> attributes<00:03:15.849> made<00:03:16.060> a<00:03:16.090> bit<00:03:16.299> higher

00:03:16.470 --> 00:03:16.480 
skill attributes made a bit higher

00:03:16.480 --> 00:03:18.690 
skill attributes made a bit higher
finishing<00:03:17.049> should<00:03:17.260> be<00:03:17.349> like<00:03:17.500> 94<00:03:18.069> because<00:03:18.130> you

00:03:18.690 --> 00:03:18.700 
finishing should be like 94 because you

00:03:18.700 --> 00:03:20.370 
finishing should be like 94 because you
know<00:03:18.819> when<00:03:19.329> he<00:03:19.389> gets<00:03:19.510> a<00:03:19.630> chance<00:03:19.660> he's<00:03:20.079> a<00:03:20.109> very

00:03:20.370 --> 00:03:20.380 
know when he gets a chance he's a very

00:03:20.380 --> 00:03:22.170 
know when he gets a chance he's a very
good<00:03:20.500> at<00:03:20.590> finishing<00:03:20.790> shot<00:03:21.790> power<00:03:21.970> as<00:03:22.120> well

00:03:22.170 --> 00:03:22.180 
good at finishing shot power as well

00:03:22.180 --> 00:03:23.640 
good at finishing shot power as well
long<00:03:22.540> shots<00:03:22.780> that<00:03:22.959> kind<00:03:23.170> of<00:03:23.230> thing<00:03:23.440> you<00:03:23.470> know

00:03:23.640 --> 00:03:23.650 
long shots that kind of thing you know

00:03:23.650 --> 00:03:25.470 
long shots that kind of thing you know
he's<00:03:23.739> a<00:03:23.769> very<00:03:23.859> good<00:03:24.190> obviously<00:03:24.519> he's<00:03:24.940> one<00:03:25.359> of

00:03:25.470 --> 00:03:25.480 
he's a very good obviously he's one of

00:03:25.480 --> 00:03:26.819 
he's a very good obviously he's one of
the<00:03:25.600> best<00:03:25.720> players<00:03:25.959> in<00:03:26.049> the<00:03:26.139> world<00:03:26.200> arguably

00:03:26.819 --> 00:03:26.829 
the best players in the world arguably

00:03:26.829 --> 00:03:28.830 
the best players in the world arguably
with<00:03:27.010> lionel<00:03:27.730> messi<00:03:28.000> and<00:03:28.180> actually<00:03:28.630> with<00:03:28.750> the

00:03:28.830 --> 00:03:28.840 
with lionel messi and actually with the

00:03:28.840 --> 00:03:31.080 
with lionel messi and actually with the
attackers<00:03:29.319> i<00:03:29.470> decrease<00:03:29.889> their<00:03:30.190> defending

00:03:31.080 --> 00:03:31.090 
attackers i decrease their defending

00:03:31.090 --> 00:03:32.729 
attackers i decrease their defending
stats<00:03:31.389> a<00:03:31.569> bit<00:03:31.840> to<00:03:32.019> what<00:03:32.170> i<00:03:32.200> think<00:03:32.470> it<00:03:32.560> should<00:03:32.709> be

00:03:32.729 --> 00:03:32.739 
stats a bit to what i think it should be

00:03:32.739 --> 00:03:34.530 
stats a bit to what i think it should be
and<00:03:33.010> also<00:03:33.160> the<00:03:33.489> defenders<00:03:33.940> decrease<00:03:34.329> their

00:03:34.530 --> 00:03:34.540 
and also the defenders decrease their

00:03:34.540 --> 00:03:36.809 
and also the defenders decrease their
attacking<00:03:34.840> stats<00:03:35.260> so<00:03:35.530> that's<00:03:36.340> probably<00:03:36.549> why

00:03:36.809 --> 00:03:36.819 
attacking stats so that's probably why

00:03:36.819 --> 00:03:38.729 
attacking stats so that's probably why
you<00:03:36.880> may<00:03:37.120> notice<00:03:37.510> some<00:03:37.540> lower<00:03:38.079> ratings<00:03:38.560> and

00:03:38.729 --> 00:03:38.739 
you may notice some lower ratings and

00:03:38.739 --> 00:03:40.319 
you may notice some lower ratings and
they<00:03:38.799> should<00:03:39.010> be<00:03:39.040> like<00:03:39.400> marcelo<00:03:39.849> and<00:03:40.060> down<00:03:40.209> to

00:03:40.319 --> 00:03:40.329 
they should be like marcelo and down to

00:03:40.329 --> 00:03:42.720 
they should be like marcelo and down to
82<00:03:40.569> i<00:03:40.720> think<00:03:41.079> was<00:03:41.230> 83<00:03:41.650> but<00:03:42.160> anyway<00:03:42.400> moving<00:03:42.549> on

00:03:42.720 --> 00:03:42.730 
82 i think was 83 but anyway moving on

00:03:42.730 --> 00:03:45.150 
82 i think was 83 but anyway moving on
to<00:03:42.910> mizzou<00:03:43.090> Ozil<00:03:43.599> he's<00:03:44.530> a<00:03:44.560> fantastic<00:03:44.829> player

00:03:45.150 --> 00:03:45.160 
to mizzou Ozil he's a fantastic player

00:03:45.160 --> 00:03:46.890 
to mizzou Ozil he's a fantastic player
in<00:03:45.430> real<00:03:45.549> life<00:03:45.730> getting<00:03:46.000> a<00:03:46.120> lot<00:03:46.209> of<00:03:46.239> assists

00:03:46.890 --> 00:03:46.900 
in real life getting a lot of assists

00:03:46.900 --> 00:03:49.229 
in real life getting a lot of assists
for<00:03:47.109> real<00:03:47.319> madrid<00:03:47.650> getting<00:03:48.430> couple<00:03:48.730> goals<00:03:48.940> but

00:03:49.229 --> 00:03:49.239 
for real madrid getting couple goals but

00:03:49.239 --> 00:03:51.089 
for real madrid getting couple goals but
you<00:03:49.840> know<00:03:49.959> he<00:03:50.169> doesn't<00:03:50.319> score<00:03:50.560> too<00:03:50.739> much<00:03:50.889> goals

00:03:51.089 --> 00:03:51.099 
you know he doesn't score too much goals

00:03:51.099 --> 00:03:52.559 
you know he doesn't score too much goals
but<00:03:51.280> he's<00:03:51.400> a<00:03:51.430> fantastic<00:03:51.639> passer<00:03:52.389> great

00:03:52.559 --> 00:03:52.569 
but he's a fantastic passer great

00:03:52.569 --> 00:03:55.110 
but he's a fantastic passer great
dribbler<00:03:53.500> as<00:03:53.620> well<00:03:53.829> and<00:03:54.069> now<00:03:54.519> he's<00:03:54.700> gone<00:03:54.760> up<00:03:55.000> to

00:03:55.110 --> 00:03:55.120 
dribbler as well and now he's gone up to

00:03:55.120 --> 00:03:56.729 
dribbler as well and now he's gone up to
88<00:03:55.419> overall<00:03:55.870> i<00:03:55.900> definitely<00:03:56.410> think<00:03:56.560> he

00:03:56.729 --> 00:03:56.739 
88 overall i definitely think he

00:03:56.739 --> 00:03:58.830 
88 overall i definitely think he
deserves<00:03:57.130> that<00:03:57.340> he's<00:03:57.579> just<00:03:57.609> keeps<00:03:58.480> getting

00:03:58.830 --> 00:03:58.840 
deserves that he's just keeps getting

00:03:58.840 --> 00:04:00.199 
deserves that he's just keeps getting
better<00:03:58.959> and<00:03:59.109> better<00:03:59.230> so<00:03:59.470> he<00:03:59.739> definitely

00:04:00.199 --> 00:04:00.209 
better and better so he definitely

00:04:00.209 --> 00:04:03.089 
better and better so he definitely
deserves<00:04:01.209> to<00:04:01.359> at<00:04:01.510> least<00:04:01.599> go<00:04:01.840> up<00:04:02.049> by<00:04:02.290> one<00:04:02.319> so<00:04:02.859> but

00:04:03.089 --> 00:04:03.099 
deserves to at least go up by one so but

00:04:03.099 --> 00:04:04.770 
deserves to at least go up by one so but
it's<00:04:03.340> not<00:04:03.489> like<00:04:03.639> I<00:04:03.760> chose<00:04:04.000> 88<00:04:04.480> like<00:04:04.690> I

perform
in<00:04:27.379> real<00:04:27.530> life<00:04:27.560> um<00:04:28.460> yeah<00:04:28.849> he<00:04:28.999> wasn't<00:04:29.300> really<00:04:29.419> he

00:04:29.709 --> 00:04:29.719 
in real life um yeah he wasn't really he

00:04:29.719 --> 00:04:30.999 
in real life um yeah he wasn't really he
hasn't<00:04:29.960> been<00:04:30.020> doing<00:04:30.080> good<00:04:30.379> in<00:04:30.499> your<00:04:30.650> life<00:04:30.680> and

00:04:30.999 --> 00:04:31.009 
hasn't been doing good in your life and

00:04:31.009 --> 00:04:32.739 
hasn't been doing good in your life and
he's<00:04:31.129> been<00:04:31.280> replaced<00:04:31.669> by<00:04:31.939> a<00:04:32.180> new<00:04:32.240> goalkeeper

00:04:32.739 --> 00:04:32.749

he's been replaced by a new goalkeeper
Diego<00:04:33.379> Lopez<00:04:33.740> so<00:04:33.919> that<00:04:34.099> definitely<00:04:34.340> I<00:04:34.749> think

00:04:35.739 --> 00:04:35.749 
Diego Lopez so that definitely I think

00:04:35.749 --> 00:04:37.149 
Diego Lopez so that definitely I think
that's<00:04:35.960> a<00:04:36.050> bit<00:04:36.199> right<00:04:36.379> I<00:04:36.409> suppose<00:04:36.560> some<00:04:36.979> real

00:04:37.149 --> 00:04:37.159 
that's a bit right I suppose some real

00:04:37.159 --> 00:04:39.339 
that's a bit right I suppose some real
madrid<00:04:37.490> supporters<00:04:37.909> may<00:04:38.060> think<00:04:38.330> yeah<00:04:39.110> i'm<00:04:39.199> not

00:04:39.339 --> 00:04:39.349 
madrid supporters may think yeah i'm not

00:04:39.349 --> 00:04:40.510 
madrid supporters may think yeah i'm not
sure<00:04:39.439> what<00:04:39.529> they'll<00:04:39.710> think<00:04:39.740> but<00:04:39.979> anyway<00:04:40.279> i'll

00:04:40.510 --> 00:04:40.520 
sure what they'll think but anyway i'll

00:04:40.520 --> 00:04:42.070 
sure what they'll think but anyway i'll

00:04:44.439 --> 00:04:44.449 
Varane he's a great player as well I put

00:04:44.449 --> 00:04:47.230 
Varane he's a great player as well I put
his<00:04:44.569> sprint<00:04:44.779> speed<00:04:44.960> 271<00:04:45.669> some<00:04:46.669> of<00:04:46.759> the<00:04:46.939> fenders

00:04:47.230 --> 00:04:47.240 
his sprint speed 271 some of the fenders

00:04:47.240 --> 00:04:48.820 
his sprint speed 271 some of the fenders
are<00:04:47.360> really<00:04:47.599> underrated<00:04:47.960> in<00:04:48.379> their<00:04:48.529> sprint

00:04:48.820 --> 00:04:48.830 
are really underrated in their sprint

00:04:48.830 --> 00:04:50.800 
are really underrated in their sprint
speed<00:04:49.009> and<00:04:49.340> pace<00:04:49.490> attributes<00:04:49.999> but<00:04:50.300> yeah

00:04:50.800 --> 00:04:50.810 
speed and pace attributes but yeah

00:04:50.810 --> 00:04:52.570 
speed and pace attributes but yeah
that's<00:04:50.960> just<00:04:51.080> my<00:04:51.289> opinion<00:04:51.319> but<00:04:51.830> I<00:04:52.099> think<00:04:52.159> in

00:04:52.570 --> 00:04:52.580 
that's just my opinion but I think in

00:04:52.580 --> 00:04:54.640 
that's just my opinion but I think in
real<00:04:52.789> life<00:04:52.969> he<00:04:53.150> can<00:04:53.330> become<00:04:53.449> a<00:04:53.629> very<00:04:53.930> fantastic

00:04:54.640 --> 00:04:54.650 
real life he can become a very fantastic

00:04:54.650 --> 00:04:59.649 
real life he can become a very fantastic
defender<00:04:55.400> also<00:04:56.150> Macau<00:04:56.449> Sen<00:04:57.080> um<00:04:58.120> again<00:04:59.120> he<00:04:59.419> used

00:04:59.649 --> 00:04:59.659 
defender also Macau Sen um again he used

00:04:59.659 --> 00:05:01.269 
defender also Macau Sen um again he used
to<00:04:59.779> be<00:04:59.840> really<00:05:00.199> good<00:05:00.500> but<00:05:00.710> I<00:05:00.860> kind<00:05:01.189> of

00:05:01.269 --> 00:05:01.279 
to be really good but I kind of

00:05:01.279 --> 00:05:02.709 
to be really good but I kind of
decreased<00:05:01.729> he<00:05:02.210> you<00:05:02.360> know<00:05:02.479> he's<00:05:02.599> a<00:05:02.629> very

00:05:02.709 --> 00:05:02.719 
decreased he you know he's a very

00:05:02.719 --> 00:05:04.480 
decreased he you know he's a very
powerful<00:05:03.080> player<00:05:03.590> but<00:05:03.770> he's<00:05:03.889> kind<00:05:04.129> of<00:05:04.219> in<00:05:04.310> real

00:05:04.480 --> 00:05:04.490 
powerful player but he's kind of in real

00:05:04.490 --> 00:05:06.040 
powerful player but he's kind of in real
life<00:05:04.669> he<00:05:04.789> seems<00:05:05.000> to<00:05:05.120> be<00:05:05.210> losing<00:05:05.659> that<00:05:05.810> power

00:05:06.040 --> 00:05:06.050 
life he seems to be losing that power

00:05:06.050 --> 00:05:08.589 
life he seems to be losing that power
about<00:05:06.379> him<00:05:06.560> so<00:05:06.860> I<00:05:06.889> kind<00:05:07.669> of<00:05:07.789> almost<00:05:08.029> decrease

00:05:08.589 --> 00:05:08.599 
about him so I kind of almost decrease

00:05:08.599 --> 00:05:10.420 
about him so I kind of almost decrease
every<00:05:09.050> attribute<00:05:09.319> by<00:05:09.740> a<00:05:09.770> little<00:05:10.069> bit<00:05:10.159> apart

00:05:10.420 --> 00:05:10.430 
every attribute by a little bit apart

00:05:10.430 --> 00:05:12.640 
every attribute by a little bit apart
from<00:05:10.610> the<00:05:10.699> passing<00:05:11.090> that<00:05:11.240> kind<00:05:11.449> of<00:05:11.509> thing<00:05:11.719> Luka

00:05:12.640 --> 00:05:12.650 
from the passing that kind of thing Luka

00:05:12.650 --> 00:05:14.200 
from the passing that kind of thing Luka
Modric<00:05:12.979> with<00:05:13.490> the<00:05:13.610> chain<00:05:13.819> i<00:05:13.849> think<00:05:14.090> it<00:05:14.150> was

00:05:14.200 --> 00:05:14.210 
Modric with the chain i think it was

00:05:14.210 --> 00:05:17.350 
Modric with the chain i think it was
like<00:05:14.360> 84<00:05:14.930> he<00:05:15.620> went<00:05:15.830> up<00:05:16.039> by<00:05:16.430> one<00:05:16.699> with<00:05:16.909> my<00:05:17.060> change

00:05:17.350 --> 00:05:17.360 
like 84 he went up by one with my change

00:05:17.360 --> 00:05:18.969 
like 84 he went up by one with my change
which<00:05:17.569> i<00:05:17.689> was<00:05:17.840> surprised<00:05:18.199> cuz<00:05:18.469> i<00:05:18.560> decreased

00:05:18.969 --> 00:05:18.979 
which i was surprised cuz i decreased

00:05:18.979 --> 00:05:21.100 
which i was surprised cuz i decreased
yeah<00:05:19.400> decreased<00:05:19.879> a<00:05:20.000> lot<00:05:20.120> of<00:05:20.240> things<00:05:20.479> but<00:05:20.750> I

00:05:21.100 --> 00:05:21.110 
yeah decreased a lot of things but I

00:05:21.110 --> 00:05:23.679 
yeah decreased a lot of things but I
increased<00:05:21.979> a<00:05:22.279> couple<00:05:22.699> of<00:05:22.849> skill<00:05:23.270> attributes

00:05:23.679 --> 00:05:23.689 
increased a couple of skill attributes

00:05:23.689 --> 00:05:25.989 
increased a couple of skill attributes
by<00:05:23.990> a<00:05:24.020> little<00:05:24.319> bit<00:05:24.439> so<00:05:24.620> maybe<00:05:24.650> that<00:05:25.099> led<00:05:25.969> to

00:05:25.989 --> 00:05:25.999 
by a little bit so maybe that led to

00:05:25.999 --> 00:05:28.329 
by a little bit so maybe that led to
being<00:05:26.419> at<00:05:26.719> the<00:05:27.110> one<00:05:27.289> point<00:05:27.589> attribute

00:05:28.329 --> 00:05:28.339 
being at the one point attribute

00:05:28.339 --> 00:05:31.179 
being at the one point attribute
increase<00:05:28.729> and<00:05:28.939> also<00:05:29.479> he's<00:05:29.659> a<00:05:29.689> big<00:05:30.020> one<00:05:30.229> gonzalo

not<00:05:34.520> sure<00:05:34.699> how<00:05:34.819> much<00:05:34.969> when<00:05:35.360> i<00:05:35.389> checked<00:05:35.689> the

00:05:35.740 --> 00:05:35.750 
not sure how much when i checked the

00:05:35.750 --> 00:05:37.899 
not sure how much when i checked the
stats<00:05:36.050> he<00:05:36.529> seems<00:05:36.770> to<00:05:36.889> get<00:05:36.979> a<00:05:37.039> lot<00:05:37.219> of<00:05:37.250> goals<00:05:37.580> for

00:05:37.899 --> 00:05:37.909 
stats he seems to get a lot of goals for

00:05:37.909 --> 00:05:39.159 
stats he seems to get a lot of goals for
games<00:05:38.120> played<00:05:38.300> i<00:05:38.479> think<00:05:38.719> he<00:05:38.779> got<00:05:38.900> like<00:05:39.050> 11

00:05:39.159 --> 00:05:39.169 
games played i think he got like 11

00:05:39.169 --> 00:05:41.740 
games played i think he got like 11
goals<00:05:39.589> in<00:05:39.800> 19<00:05:40.159> games<00:05:40.189> but<00:05:41.150> don't<00:05:41.330> quote<00:05:41.479> me<00:05:41.719> on

00:05:41.740 --> 00:05:41.750 
goals in 19 games but don't quote me on

00:05:41.750 --> 00:05:44.170 
goals in 19 games but don't quote me on
that<00:05:41.870> and<00:05:42.409> ninety-two<00:05:43.189> finishing<00:05:43.610> to<00:05:43.759> me<00:05:43.879> like

00:05:44.170 --> 00:05:44.180 
that and ninety-two finishing to me like

00:05:44.180 --> 00:05:46.179 
that and ninety-two finishing to me like
he's<00:05:44.389> a<00:05:44.419> really<00:05:45.080> clinical<00:05:45.529> finisher<00:05:45.979> and

00:05:46.179 --> 00:05:46.189 
he's a really clinical finisher and

00:05:46.189 --> 00:05:48.519 
he's a really clinical finisher and
probably<00:05:47.149> one<00:05:47.300> of<00:05:47.360> the<00:05:47.659> best<00:05:47.779> finishes<00:05:48.169> in<00:05:48.439> the

00:05:48.519 --> 00:05:48.529 
probably one of the best finishes in the

00:05:48.529 --> 00:05:50.559 
probably one of the best finishes in the
world<00:05:48.710> and<00:05:49.009> also<00:05:49.460> his<00:05:49.639> pace<00:05:49.849> was<00:05:50.089> a<00:05:50.120> bit<00:05:50.300> under

00:05:50.559 --> 00:05:50.569 
world and also his pace was a bit under

00:05:50.569 --> 00:05:52.389 
world and also his pace was a bit under
aid<00:05:50.689> in<00:05:50.810> my<00:05:50.960> opinion<00:05:51.229> he's<00:05:51.620> a<00:05:51.680> bit<00:05:51.860> fast<00:05:52.099> like

00:05:52.389 --> 00:05:52.399 
aid in my opinion he's a bit fast like

00:05:52.399 --> 00:05:54.459 
aid in my opinion he's a bit fast like
they<00:05:52.969> really<00:05:53.149> underrated<00:05:53.569> his<00:05:53.990> pay<00:05:54.199> so<00:05:54.259> i

00:05:54.459 --> 00:05:54.469 
they really underrated his pay so i

00:05:54.469 --> 00:05:55.659 
they really underrated his pay so i
increased<00:05:54.860> it<00:05:54.979> by<00:05:55.039> a<00:05:55.099> little<00:05:55.370> bit<00:05:55.460> but<00:05:55.580> I

00:05:55.659 --> 00:05:55.669 
increased it by a little bit but I

00:05:55.669 --> 00:05:56.679 
increased it by a little bit but I
didn't<00:05:55.819> want<00:05:55.849> to<00:05:56.000> increase<00:05:56.240> it<00:05:56.419> too<00:05:56.539> much

00:05:56.679 --> 00:05:56.689 
didn't want to increase it too much

00:05:56.689 --> 00:05:58.749 
didn't want to increase it too much
because<00:05:56.870> people<00:05:57.259> might<00:05:57.379> yeah<00:05:58.279> complain<00:05:58.669> about

00:05:58.749 --> 00:05:58.759 
because people might yeah complain about

00:05:58.759 --> 00:06:00.450 
because people might yeah complain about
that<00:05:59.000> but<00:05:59.539> then<00:05:59.659> there's<00:05:59.839> Fabio<00:06:00.139> Coentrao

00:06:00.450 --> 00:06:00.460 
that but then there's Fabio Coentrao

00:06:00.460 --> 00:06:02.950 
that but then there's Fabio Coentrao
he's<00:06:01.460> a<00:06:01.490> very<00:06:01.610> good<00:06:01.909> attacking<00:06:02.270> player<00:06:02.659> maybe

00:06:02.950 --> 00:06:02.960 
he's a very good attacking player maybe

00:06:02.960 --> 00:06:04.659 
he's a very good attacking player maybe
he's<00:06:03.199> not<00:06:03.349> as<00:06:03.560> great<00:06:03.860> as<00:06:03.889> defensively

00:06:04.659 --> 00:06:04.669 
he's not as great as defensively

00:06:04.669 --> 00:06:06.490 
he's not as great as defensively
probably<00:06:05.210> as<00:06:05.419> Marcelo<00:06:05.930> but<00:06:06.229> he's<00:06:06.379> probably

00:06:06.490 --> 00:06:06.500 
probably as Marcelo but he's probably

00:06:06.500 --> 00:06:08.409 
probably as Marcelo but he's probably
better<00:06:06.830> going<00:06:07.039> forward<00:06:07.129> but<00:06:08.000> yeah<00:06:08.089> he's<00:06:08.270> not

00:06:08.409 --> 00:06:08.419 
better going forward but yeah he's not

00:06:08.419 --> 00:06:09.760 
better going forward but yeah he's not
bad<00:06:08.629> at<00:06:08.839> tackling<00:06:09.169> you<00:06:09.289> know<00:06:09.409> he's<00:06:09.560> played

00:06:09.760 --> 00:06:09.770 
bad at tackling you know he's played

00:06:09.770 --> 00:06:12.219 
bad at tackling you know he's played
numerous<00:06:10.159> positions<00:06:10.639> in<00:06:11.060> his<00:06:11.180> career<00:06:11.419> I<00:06:11.689> play

00:06:12.219 --> 00:06:12.229 
numerous positions in his career I play

00:06:12.229 --> 00:06:13.990

00:06:19.490 --> 00:06:21.639 
anyway moving on to Jose kalyan um he's
Pacey<00:06:19.789> but<00:06:20.149> I<00:06:20.180> decreased<00:06:21.050> his<00:06:21.259> pace<00:06:21.439> by<00:06:21.620> a

00:06:21.639 --> 00:06:21.649 
Pacey but I decreased his pace by a

00:06:21.649 --> 00:06:24.219 
Pacey but I decreased his pace by a
little<00:06:21.979> bit<00:06:22.069> not<00:06:22.219> too<00:06:22.250> much<00:06:22.810> he<00:06:23.810> hasn't<00:06:24.050> really

00:06:24.219 --> 00:06:24.229 
little bit not too much he hasn't really

00:06:24.229 --> 00:06:25.990 
little bit not too much he hasn't really
done<00:06:24.409> much<00:06:24.649> this<00:06:25.009> season<00:06:25.219> by<00:06:25.580> taking<00:06:25.729> the

00:06:25.990 --> 00:06:26.000 
done much this season by taking the

00:06:26.000 --> 00:06:27.249 
done much this season by taking the
stats<00:06:26.210> I<00:06:26.330> think<00:06:26.509> he's<00:06:26.599> only<00:06:26.719> scored<00:06:26.870> one<00:06:27.229> goal

00:06:27.249 --> 00:06:27.259 
stats I think he's only scored one goal

00:06:27.259 --> 00:06:29.649 
stats I think he's only scored one goal
in<00:06:27.469> the<00:06:27.770> league<00:06:27.919> so<00:06:28.219> yeah<00:06:28.909> I<00:06:28.939> decreased<00:06:29.509> some

00:06:29.649 --> 00:06:29.659 
in the league so yeah I decreased some

00:06:29.659 --> 00:06:31.540 
in the league so yeah I decreased some
attributes<00:06:30.110> because<00:06:30.500> yeah<00:06:30.770> he<00:06:31.009> wasn't<00:06:31.460> that

00:06:31.540 --> 00:06:31.550 
attributes because yeah he wasn't that

00:06:31.550 --> 00:06:33.939 
attributes because yeah he wasn't that
great<00:06:31.759> but<00:06:31.969> he's<00:06:32.089> rating<00:06:32.689> is<00:06:32.810> still<00:06:32.960> 78<00:06:33.500> so<00:06:33.770> I

00:06:33.939 --> 00:06:33.949 
great but he's rating is still 78 so I

00:06:33.949 --> 00:06:35.259 
great but he's rating is still 78 so I
was<00:06:34.279> surprised<00:06:34.580> you<00:06:34.699> with<00:06:34.759> that<00:06:34.879> I<00:06:34.939> thought<00:06:35.180> it

00:06:39.249 --> 00:06:39.259 
like 76 or something because yeah he

00:06:39.259 --> 00:06:40.810 
like 76 or something because yeah he
doesn't<00:06:39.529> have<00:06:39.649> much<00:06:39.860> great<00:06:40.069> attributes

for some reason I missed him I'm not

00:06:45.980 --> 00:06:47.830 
for some reason I missed him I'm not
sure<00:06:46.130> when<00:06:46.280> I<00:06:46.340> was<00:06:46.460> editing<00:06:46.850> yeah<00:06:47.450> maybe<00:06:47.660> when

00:06:47.830 --> 00:06:47.840 
sure when I was editing yeah maybe when

00:06:47.840 --> 00:06:49.300 
sure when I was editing yeah maybe when
I<00:06:47.900> was<00:06:48.050> just<00:06:48.200> changing<00:06:48.350> the<00:06:48.590> ratings<00:06:48.980> I<00:06:49.100> missed

00:06:49.300 --> 00:06:49.310

him<00:06:49.460> but<00:06:49.610> he<00:06:49.820> stays<00:06:50.060> the<00:06:50.300> same<00:06:50.480> I<00:06:50.810> think<00:06:51.290> his

00:06:51.340 --> 00:06:51.350 
him but he stays the same I think his

00:06:51.350 --> 00:06:52.990 
him but he stays the same I think his
pace<00:06:51.590> should<00:06:51.770> be<00:06:51.860> more<00:06:52.040> but<00:06:52.250> like<00:06:52.520> I<00:06:52.550> said<00:06:52.670> and

00:06:52.990 --> 00:06:53.000 
pace should be more but like I said and

00:06:53.000 --> 00:06:55.530 
pace should be more but like I said and
then<00:06:53.480> this<00:06:53.630> car<00:06:54.020> I<00:06:54.170> kind<00:06:54.410> of<00:06:54.560> increased<00:06:55.250> his

00:06:55.540 --> 00:06:57.820 
then this car I kind of increased his
physical<00:06:56.540> attributes<00:06:56.990> in<00:06:57.170> the<00:06:57.230> pace<00:06:57.560> ones
