00:01:22.470 --> 00:01:29.240 

so<00:01:23.470> now<00:01:23.590> we<00:01:23.650> have<00:01:23.890> our<00:01:24.010> pace<00:01:24.280> nice<00:01:24.730> and<00:01:25.030> smooth

00:01:29.240 --> 00:01:29.250 

00:01:29.250 --> 00:01:31.590

00:01:34.400 --> 00:01:34.410 
so we're going to add that to our bowl

00:01:34.410 --> 00:01:41.590 
so we're going to add that to our bowl
with<00:01:35.410> our<00:01:35.590> egg<00:01:35.800> yolk

00:01:41.590 --> 00:01:41.600 

00:01:41.600 --> 00:01:46.899 

and<00:01:42.230> a<00:01:42.680> bit<00:01:42.890> of<00:01:42.920> water<00:01:43.700> and<00:01:45.490> we're<00:01:46.490> gonna<00:01:46.610> whisk

00:01:46.899 --> 00:01:46.909 
and a bit of water and we're gonna whisk

00:01:46.909 --> 00:01:51.969 
and a bit of water and we're gonna whisk
to<00:01:47.240> combine<00:01:48.970> and<00:01:50.350> then<00:01:51.350> while<00:01:51.650> we're<00:01:51.800> whisking

00:01:51.969 --> 00:01:51.979 
to combine and then while we're whisking

00:01:51.979 --> 00:01:55.510 
to combine and then while we're whisking
we'll<00:01:52.370> slowly<00:01:52.729> add<00:01:53.060> in<00:01:53.240> some<00:01:53.450> olive<00:01:53.810> oil<00:01:54.520> to

00:01:55.510 --> 00:01:55.520 
we'll slowly add in some olive oil to

00:01:55.520 --> 00:01:58.359 
we'll slowly add in some olive oil to
turn<00:01:55.880> it<00:01:56.090> to<00:01:56.300> thicken<00:01:56.690> it<00:01:56.900> up<00:01:57.250> we're<00:01:58.250> gonna

00:01:58.359 --> 00:01:58.369 
turn it to thicken it up we're gonna

00:01:58.369 --> 00:02:00.400 
turn it to thicken it up we're gonna
whisk<00:01:58.670> in<00:01:58.880> a<00:01:58.970> figure<00:01:59.300> eight<00:01:59.510> motion<00:01:59.540> and

00:02:00.400 --> 00:02:00.410 
whisk in a figure eight motion and

00:02:00.410 --> 00:02:02.440 
whisk in a figure eight motion and
that's<00:02:00.710> gonna<00:02:00.860> help<00:02:01.100> everything<00:02:01.580> combined<00:02:02.060> if

00:02:02.440 --> 00:02:02.450 
that's gonna help everything combined if

00:02:02.450 --> 00:02:05.740 
that's gonna help everything combined if
you<00:02:03.200> whisk<00:02:03.560> in<00:02:03.860> a<00:02:03.979> circular<00:02:04.250> motion<00:02:04.729> it<00:02:05.270> pushes

00:02:05.740 --> 00:02:05.750 
you whisk in a circular motion it pushes

00:02:05.750 --> 00:02:07.780 
you whisk in a circular motion it pushes
everything<00:02:05.840> around<00:02:06.290> together<00:02:06.740> and<00:02:07.100> it

00:02:07.780 --> 00:02:07.790 
everything around together and it

00:02:07.790 --> 00:02:09.580 
everything around together and it
doesn't<00:02:07.970> combine<00:02:08.330> as<00:02:08.690> quickly<00:02:08.959> so<00:02:09.289> it's

00:02:09.580 --> 00:02:09.590 
doesn't combine as quickly so it's

00:02:09.590 --> 00:02:11.260 
doesn't combine as quickly so it's
getting<00:02:09.860> nice<00:02:10.039> and<00:02:10.310> thick<00:02:10.580> and<00:02:10.610> emulsified

00:02:11.260 --> 00:02:11.270 
getting nice and thick and emulsified

00:02:11.270 --> 00:02:13.480 
getting nice and thick and emulsified
and<00:02:11.450> changing<00:02:11.959> to<00:02:11.990> a<00:02:12.080> pale<00:02:12.500> or<00:02:12.830> yellow<00:02:13.190> color

00:02:13.480 --> 00:02:13.490 
and changing to a pale or yellow color

00:02:13.490 --> 00:02:18.040 
and changing to a pale or yellow color
so<00:02:15.459> keep<00:02:16.459> whisking<00:02:16.730> just<00:02:17.630> let<00:02:17.780> it<00:02:17.900> get<00:02:18.020> a

00:02:18.040 --> 00:02:18.050 
so keep whisking just let it get a

00:02:18.050 --> 00:02:19.660 
so keep whisking just let it get a
little<00:02:18.380> bit<00:02:18.500> thicker<00:02:18.530> and<00:02:18.950> a<00:02:19.040> little<00:02:19.070> bit

00:02:19.660 --> 00:02:19.670 
little bit thicker and a little bit

00:02:19.670 --> 00:02:26.910 
little bit thicker and a little bit
paler<00:02:19.910> yellow

00:02:26.910 --> 00:02:26.920 

00:02:26.920 --> 00:02:29.500
