00:03:06.170 --> 00:03:06.180 
right there one of the cons to calling

00:03:06.180 --> 00:03:09.050 
right there one of the cons to calling
in<00:03:06.300> your<00:03:06.420> AC<00:03:06.600> 130<00:03:07.020> over<00:03:07.380> your<00:03:07.500> Harrier<00:03:07.860> is<00:03:08.130> the

00:03:09.050 --> 00:03:09.060 
in your AC 130 over your Harrier is the

00:03:09.060 --> 00:03:10.670 
in your AC 130 over your Harrier is the
fact<00:03:09.300> that<00:03:09.420> you<00:03:09.570> can<00:03:09.750> destroy<00:03:10.140> it<00:03:10.320> that's<00:03:10.530> why

00:03:10.670 --> 00:03:10.680 
fact that you can destroy it that's why

00:03:10.680 --> 00:03:12.530 
fact that you can destroy it that's why
I<00:03:10.710> used<00:03:10.980> to<00:03:11.130> never<00:03:11.280> shoot<00:03:11.670> never<00:03:12.150> call<00:03:12.360> my

00:03:12.530 --> 00:03:12.540 
I used to never shoot never call my

00:03:12.540 --> 00:03:15.140 
I used to never shoot never call my
ac-130<00:03:13.020> s<00:03:13.140> over<00:03:13.350> my<00:03:13.470> areas<00:03:13.800> but<00:03:14.730> now<00:03:14.910> I<00:03:14.940> do

00:03:15.140 --> 00:03:15.150 
ac-130 s over my areas but now I do

00:03:15.150 --> 00:03:18.620 
ac-130 s over my areas but now I do
because<00:03:15.690> I<00:03:15.810> realize<00:03:16.200> that<00:03:16.230> I'm<00:03:17.360> that<00:03:18.360> while

00:03:18.620 --> 00:03:18.630 
because I realize that I'm that while

00:03:18.630 --> 00:03:20.990 
because I realize that I'm that while
your<00:03:18.780> hair<00:03:18.930> is<00:03:19.080> racking<00:03:19.500> up<00:03:19.560> kills<00:03:19.970> the<00:03:20.970> other

00:03:20.990 --> 00:03:21.000 
your hair is racking up kills the other

00:03:21.000 --> 00:03:22.550 
your hair is racking up kills the other
team<00:03:21.270> is<00:03:21.390> going<00:03:21.480> to<00:03:21.540> be<00:03:21.660> spawning<00:03:22.020> somewhere

00:03:22.550 --> 00:03:22.560 
team is going to be spawning somewhere

00:03:22.560 --> 00:03:25.430 
team is going to be spawning somewhere
so<00:03:22.830> that<00:03:23.070> basically<00:03:23.430> gives<00:03:23.850> you<00:03:24.230> the<00:03:25.230> chance

00:03:25.430 --> 00:03:25.440 
so that basically gives you the chance

00:03:25.440 --> 00:03:27.350 
so that basically gives you the chance
to<00:03:25.650> get<00:03:26.220> them<00:03:26.400> with<00:03:26.520> your<00:03:26.610> AC<00:03:26.760> 130<00:03:27.060> while

00:03:27.350 --> 00:03:27.360 
to get them with your AC 130 while

00:03:27.360 --> 00:03:28.970 
to get them with your AC 130 while
they're<00:03:27.480> spawning<00:03:27.750> it<00:03:28.440> was<00:03:28.530> the<00:03:28.590> only<00:03:28.710> way<00:03:28.920> to

00:03:28.970 --> 00:03:28.980 
they're spawning it was the only way to

00:03:28.980 --> 00:03:30.530 
they're spawning it was the only way to
do<00:03:29.130> good<00:03:29.280> with<00:03:29.430> an<00:03:29.550> ac-130<00:03:30.030> s<00:03:30.120> to<00:03:30.240> be<00:03:30.330> getting

00:03:30.530 --> 00:03:30.540 
do good with an ac-130 s to be getting

00:03:30.540 --> 00:03:32.750 
do good with an ac-130 s to be getting
those<00:03:30.630> multi<00:03:30.990> kills<00:03:31.230> and<00:03:31.560> if<00:03:32.490> they're<00:03:32.640> not

00:03:32.750 --> 00:03:32.760 
those multi kills and if they're not

00:03:32.760 --> 00:03:34.250 
those multi kills and if they're not
spawning<00:03:33.150> you're<00:03:33.720> not<00:03:33.870> going<00:03:34.050> to<00:03:34.110> be<00:03:34.170> getting

00:03:34.250 --> 00:03:34.260 
spawning you're not going to be getting

00:03:34.260 --> 00:03:37.460 
spawning you're not going to be getting
them<00:03:34.470> in<00:03:34.590> groups<00:03:34.770> so<00:03:35.160> I<00:03:36.110> don't<00:03:37.110> get<00:03:37.230> the<00:03:37.350> new

00:03:37.460 --> 00:03:37.470 
them in groups so I don't get the new

00:03:37.470 --> 00:03:40.730 
them in groups so I don't get the new
golf<00:03:37.680> my<00:03:37.860> c-130<00:03:38.460> and<00:03:38.850> I<00:03:39.390> that's<00:03:40.260> good<00:03:40.530> because

00:03:40.730 --> 00:03:40.740 
golf my c-130 and I that's good because

00:03:40.740 --> 00:03:42.110 
golf my c-130 and I that's good because
it<00:03:41.190> makes<00:03:41.340> the<00:03:41.460> gameplay<00:03:41.790> bit<00:03:42.000> more

00:03:42.110 --> 00:03:42.120 
it makes the gameplay bit more

00:03:42.120 --> 00:03:46.910 
it makes the gameplay bit more
interesting<00:03:42.390> you<00:03:43.380> could<00:03:43.500> say<00:03:45.200> so<00:03:46.200> obviously
