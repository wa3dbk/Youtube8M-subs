00:00:15.049 --> 00:00:19.619
 as jungle king or monkey princess 

00:00:18.000 --> 00:00:21.660
 you do not have it all that easy 

00:00:19.619 --> 00:00:23.550
 all day enjoy the sun now and then 

00:00:21.660 --> 00:00:25.199
 a sheikh and a course 

00:00:23.550 --> 00:00:27.210
 Variety elephants ride 

00:00:25.199 --> 00:00:29.400
 Who is that surprised that our two 

00:00:27.210 --> 00:00:31.320
 players from the keeper and kumba sometimes 

00:00:29.400 --> 00:00:33.329
 you want to go hunting for adventure 

00:00:31.320 --> 00:00:35.130
 when he is just bored 

00:00:33.329 --> 00:00:37.680
 challenge yourself to the ultimate 

00:00:35.130 --> 00:00:39.660
 highscore race out the best 

00:00:37.680 --> 00:00:41.520
 You can do both of them with your race 

00:00:39.660 --> 00:00:43.410
 properly under the arms 

00:00:41.520 --> 00:00:45.780
 because at our game tippgeber and 

00:00:43.410 --> 00:00:47.520
 kumba channel one is about it 

00:00:45.780 --> 00:00:49.020
 obstacles to the jungle despite 

00:00:47.520 --> 00:00:50.760
 to be the fastest 

00:00:49.020 --> 00:00:53.010
 so you run as one of the two 

00:00:50.760 --> 00:00:55.530
 go and try dangerous enemies 

00:00:53.010 --> 00:00:56.340
 dodge for the ultimate best time 

00:00:55.530 --> 00:00:58.079
 establish 

00:00:56.340 --> 00:00:59.550
 Enough talk I pull now 

00:00:58.079 --> 00:01:01.530
 our two favorite monkeys keeper 

00:00:59.550 --> 00:01:05.270
 and let's go and show together 

00:01:01.530 --> 00:01:05.270
 what matters in the game 

00:01:07.710 --> 00:01:11.530
 you have to agree to one of 

00:01:09.850 --> 00:01:13.420
 decide our two games 

00:01:11.530 --> 00:01:14.440
 deny her the race with ski or 

00:01:13.420 --> 00:01:16.240
 with cuba 

00:01:14.440 --> 00:01:18.010
 because the two run at the same speed 

00:01:16.240 --> 00:01:19.990
 does not affect your decision 

00:01:18.010 --> 00:01:23.160
 the highscore off nevertheless makes it fun 

00:01:19.990 --> 00:01:25.390
 both run and fight 

00:01:23.160 --> 00:01:27.250
 is controlled exclusively with yours 

00:01:25.390 --> 00:01:29.380
 keyboard with the arrow keys reindeer 

00:01:27.250 --> 00:01:31.270
 forwards wants to jump or through 

00:01:29.380 --> 00:01:33.220
 you can use the spacebar beforehand 

00:01:31.270 --> 00:01:36.840
 Collected coconuts from your opponents 

00:01:33.220 --> 00:01:36.840
 to throw them out of the way 

00:01:37.020 --> 00:01:41.050
 because the background of itself 

00:01:39.250 --> 00:01:42.100
 you've been moving steadily ever since 

00:01:41.050 --> 00:01:43.900
 could not stop 

00:01:42.100 --> 00:01:46.920
 therefore you have to react quickly if 

00:01:43.900 --> 00:01:46.920
 obstacles open up 

00:01:47.040 --> 00:01:51.460
 because that's what the game is about 

00:01:49.630 --> 00:01:53.380
 comes as far as possible 

00:01:51.460 --> 00:01:54.970
 for that you have to jump over ditches 

00:01:53.380 --> 00:01:56.979
 fast to adversaries college 

00:01:54.970 --> 00:01:58.870
 Print goad yourselves or when even 

00:01:56.979 --> 00:02:00.760
 nothing more the opponents throw off 

00:01:58.870 --> 00:02:02.680
 but beware you can get up to three 

00:02:00.760 --> 00:02:06.280
 Coconuts with you think about you 

00:02:02.680 --> 00:02:08.450
 good because he uses them 

00:02:06.280 --> 00:02:10.429
 your points are made up of the 

00:02:08.450 --> 00:02:12.440
 eroticism and the removal together 

00:02:10.429 --> 00:02:14.840
 Amount of bananas here play history 

00:02:12.440 --> 00:02:17.000
 collected pick up is also found one 

00:02:14.840 --> 00:02:20.660
 super banana the extra many points 

00:02:17.000 --> 00:02:22.040
 bring if you especially long 

00:02:20.660 --> 00:02:24.140
 by consider increasing the 

00:02:22.040 --> 00:02:25.970
 Game speed making it right 

00:02:24.140 --> 00:02:29.440
 tricky is a super high score 

00:02:25.970 --> 00:02:32.330
 aufzustecken but he says yes profis 

00:02:29.440 --> 00:02:34.310
 small tip on the edge sometimes straight 

00:02:32.330 --> 00:02:36.110
 at higher tempo it is helpful times 

00:02:34.310 --> 00:02:38.329
 on the left or center of the screen too 

00:02:36.110 --> 00:02:40.299
 Run around the obstacles targeted 

00:02:38.329 --> 00:02:42.680
 to go away 

00:02:40.299 --> 00:02:44.750
 now it is up to you to decide 

00:02:42.680 --> 00:02:46.340
 for keeper or grief or play 

00:02:44.750 --> 00:02:48.019
 just both and set a highscore 

00:02:46.340 --> 00:02:49.880
 Of course you can do that too 

00:02:48.019 --> 00:02:52.099
