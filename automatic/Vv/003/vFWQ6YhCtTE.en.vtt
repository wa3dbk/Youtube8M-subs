thing<00:04:11.169> was<00:04:11.349> done<00:04:11.560> for<00:04:11.829> the<00:04:11.980> volume<00:04:12.430> to<00:04:12.790> do<00:04:12.970> that

00:04:13.170 --> 00:04:13.180 
thing was done for the volume to do that

00:04:13.180 --> 00:04:16.469 
thing was done for the volume to do that
I<00:04:13.450> simply<00:04:13.780> dragged<00:04:14.500> and<00:04:14.829> dropped<00:04:14.909> both<00:04:15.909> amps
