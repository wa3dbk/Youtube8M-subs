00:00:24.200 --> 00:00:24.210 
a narrator flight and actually go over

00:00:24.210 --> 00:00:25.730 
a narrator flight and actually go over
what<00:00:24.720> it<00:00:24.810> is<00:00:24.900> that<00:00:25.080> we<00:00:25.170> do<00:00:25.290> when<00:00:25.439> we<00:00:25.529> fly

00:00:25.730 --> 00:00:25.740 
what it is that we do when we fly

00:00:25.740 --> 00:00:27.260 
what it is that we do when we fly
together<00:00:25.950> the<00:00:26.220> flight<00:00:26.460> modes<00:00:26.700> that<00:00:26.820> we<00:00:26.910> flying

00:00:27.260 --> 00:00:27.270 
together the flight modes that we flying

00:00:27.270 --> 00:00:29.030 
together the flight modes that we flying
etc<00:00:27.779> so<00:00:28.020> I<00:00:28.050> thought<00:00:28.560> this<00:00:28.680> would<00:00:28.740> be<00:00:28.860> a<00:00:28.919> good

00:00:29.030 --> 00:00:29.040 
etc so I thought this would be a good

my<00:00:33.600> quad<00:00:34.070> so<00:00:35.070> I'm<00:00:35.340> you'll<00:00:35.519> notice<00:00:35.760> we<00:00:35.879> stand

00:00:36.080 --> 00:00:36.090 
my quad so I'm you'll notice we stand

00:00:36.090 --> 00:00:37.729 
my quad so I'm you'll notice we stand
quite<00:00:36.360> close<00:00:36.720> to<00:00:36.930> each<00:00:36.960> other<00:00:37.140> and<00:00:37.350> the<00:00:37.440> reason

00:00:37.729 --> 00:00:37.739 
quite close to each other and the reason

00:00:37.739 --> 00:00:39.259 
quite close to each other and the reason
for<00:00:37.769> that<00:00:37.920> is<00:00:38.010> we<00:00:38.190> need<00:00:38.309> to<00:00:38.430> communicate<00:00:38.610> and

00:00:39.259 --> 00:00:39.269 
for that is we need to communicate and

for that is we need to communicate and
as<00:00:39.690> the<00:00:40.379> lead<00:00:40.620> quad<00:00:41.309> I<00:00:41.519> need<00:00:41.820> to<00:00:41.910> actually<00:00:42.030> be

00:00:42.229 --> 00:00:42.239 
as the lead quad I need to actually be

00:00:42.239 --> 00:00:44.240 
as the lead quad I need to actually be
letting<00:00:42.480> Thomas<00:00:42.780> know<00:00:42.930> exactly<00:00:43.410> what<00:00:43.590> is<00:00:43.739> that

00:00:44.240 --> 00:00:44.250 
letting Thomas know exactly what is that

00:00:44.250 --> 00:00:46.399 
letting Thomas know exactly what is that
I'm<00:00:44.370> doing<00:00:44.580> because<00:00:45.239> obviously<00:00:45.570> I've<00:00:45.960> got<00:00:46.140> no

00:00:46.399 --> 00:00:46.409 
I'm doing because obviously I've got no

00:00:46.409 --> 00:00:47.840 
I'm doing because obviously I've got no
idea<00:00:46.440> where<00:00:46.860> Thomas<00:00:47.159> is<00:00:47.280> I've<00:00:47.430> taken<00:00:47.610> off

00:00:47.840 --> 00:00:47.850 
idea where Thomas is I've taken off

00:00:47.850 --> 00:00:49.910 
idea where Thomas is I've taken off
quite<00:00:48.089> slowly<00:00:48.360> and<00:00:48.690> as<00:00:49.260> you<00:00:49.379> said<00:00:49.589> Thomas's

00:00:55.280 --> 00:00:55.290 
where there are I'm flying at the right

00:00:55.290 --> 00:00:57.710 
where there are I'm flying at the right
speed<00:00:55.500> for<00:00:55.559> you<00:00:55.710> wasn't<00:00:55.860> it<00:00:55.979> um<00:00:56.610> yes<00:00:57.299> it<00:00:57.600> is

00:00:57.710 --> 00:00:57.720 
speed for you wasn't it um yes it is

00:00:57.720 --> 00:00:59.420 
speed for you wasn't it um yes it is
quite<00:00:58.170> important<00:00:58.559> being<00:00:58.710> in<00:00:58.799> the<00:00:58.890> right<00:00:59.040> speed

00:00:59.420 --> 00:00:59.430 
quite important being in the right speed

00:00:59.430 --> 00:01:02.539 
quite important being in the right speed
that<00:00:59.729> if<00:00:59.970> the<00:01:00.769> following<00:01:01.769> pilot<00:01:01.949> falls<00:01:02.369> behind

00:01:02.539 --> 00:01:02.549 
that if the following pilot falls behind

00:01:02.549 --> 00:01:06.230 
that if the following pilot falls behind
he<00:01:03.059> can<00:01:03.210> pick<00:01:03.449> up<00:01:03.629> speed<00:01:04.080> but<00:01:04.559> not<00:01:04.710> too<00:01:05.240> slow

00:01:06.230 --> 00:01:06.240 
he can pick up speed but not too slow

00:01:06.240 --> 00:01:08.660 
he can pick up speed but not too slow
that<00:01:07.049> the<00:01:07.140> personal<00:01:07.440> easier<00:01:07.860> take<00:01:08.130> yeah<00:01:08.490> it's

00:01:08.660 --> 00:01:08.670 
that the personal easier take yeah it's

00:01:08.670 --> 00:01:10.039 
that the personal easier take yeah it's
different<00:01:08.790> flying<00:01:09.210> in<00:01:09.390> a<00:01:09.450> location<00:01:09.840> like

00:01:10.039 --> 00:01:10.049 
different flying in a location like

00:01:10.049 --> 00:01:11.330 
different flying in a location like
that's<00:01:10.380> when<00:01:10.500> you're<00:01:10.619> trying<00:01:10.770> to<00:01:10.860> a<00:01:10.950> formation

00:01:11.330 --> 00:01:11.340 
that's when you're trying to a formation

00:01:11.340 --> 00:01:12.880 
that's when you're trying to a formation
flight<00:01:11.549> because<00:01:11.909> if<00:01:12.119> you're<00:01:12.510> doing<00:01:12.720> a

00:01:12.880 --> 00:01:12.890 
flight because if you're doing a

00:01:12.890 --> 00:01:14.539 
flight because if you're doing a
predetermined<00:01:13.890> course<00:01:14.130> for<00:01:14.400> you're

00:01:14.539 --> 00:01:14.549 
predetermined course for you're

00:01:14.549 --> 00:01:16.010 
predetermined course for you're
following<00:01:15.090> a<00:01:15.210> track<00:01:15.450> or<00:01:15.600> something<00:01:15.869> like<00:01:15.960> that

00:01:16.010 --> 00:01:16.020 
following a track or something like that

00:01:16.020 --> 00:01:17.960 
following a track or something like that
it's<00:01:16.290> pretty<00:01:16.500> easy<00:01:16.680> for<00:01:17.070> the<00:01:17.280> chase<00:01:17.549> pilot

00:01:17.960 --> 00:01:17.970 
it's pretty easy for the chase pilot

00:01:17.970 --> 00:01:19.490 
it's pretty easy for the chase pilot
because<00:01:18.510> you<00:01:18.600> know<00:01:18.690> exactly<00:01:18.720> where<00:01:19.290> the<00:01:19.380> other

00:01:19.490 --> 00:01:19.500 
because you know exactly where the other

00:01:19.500 --> 00:01:21.830 
because you know exactly where the other
pilots<00:01:19.860> going<00:01:20.010> to<00:01:20.100> be<00:01:20.220> but<00:01:20.490> in<00:01:21.150> this<00:01:21.450> sort<00:01:21.810> of

00:01:21.830 --> 00:01:21.840 
pilots going to be but in this sort of

00:01:21.840 --> 00:01:23.780 
pilots going to be but in this sort of
environment<00:01:21.990> Thomas<00:01:22.770> has<00:01:22.890> got<00:01:23.040> virtually<00:01:23.460> no

00:01:23.780 --> 00:01:23.790 
environment Thomas has got virtually no

00:01:23.790 --> 00:01:26.030 
environment Thomas has got virtually no
idea<00:01:24.150> where<00:01:24.330> I'm<00:01:24.420> going<00:01:24.450> to<00:01:24.690> go<00:01:24.840> so<00:01:25.710> he's

00:01:26.030 --> 00:01:26.040 
idea where I'm going to go so he's

00:01:26.040 --> 00:01:28.490 
idea where I'm going to go so he's
basically<00:01:26.760> following<00:01:27.450> my<00:01:27.660> quad<00:01:27.960> 90<00:01:28.260> to<00:01:28.380> let

00:01:28.490 --> 00:01:28.500 
basically following my quad 90 to let

00:01:28.500 --> 00:01:29.570 
basically following my quad 90 to let
him<00:01:28.590> know<00:01:28.620> look<00:01:28.860> I'm<00:01:28.980> going<00:01:29.100> to<00:01:29.160> start<00:01:29.310> banking

00:01:29.570 --> 00:01:29.580 
him know look I'm going to start banking

00:01:29.580 --> 00:01:32.120 
him know look I'm going to start banking
left<00:01:29.970> and<00:01:30.780> nice<00:01:31.320> a<00:01:31.350> slide<00:01:31.710> and<00:01:31.800> it's<00:01:31.950> just<00:01:32.100> a

00:01:32.120 --> 00:01:32.130 
left and nice a slide and it's just a

00:01:32.130 --> 00:01:33.680 
left and nice a slide and it's just a
matter<00:01:32.250> of<00:01:32.340> moving<00:01:32.460> really<00:01:33.120> smooth<00:01:33.480> on<00:01:33.600> the

00:01:33.680 --> 00:01:33.690 
matter of moving really smooth on the

00:01:33.690 --> 00:01:35.480 
matter of moving really smooth on the
sticks<00:01:33.900> just<00:01:34.110> to<00:01:34.230> help<00:01:34.320> you<00:01:34.470> was<00:01:34.620> done<00:01:34.770> oh<00:01:34.890> yes

00:01:35.480 --> 00:01:35.490 
sticks just to help you was done oh yes

00:01:35.490 --> 00:01:37.670 
sticks just to help you was done oh yes
because<00:01:35.850> any<00:01:36.060> erratic<00:01:36.330> movements<00:01:36.990> can<00:01:37.110> easily

00:01:37.670 --> 00:01:37.680 
because any erratic movements can easily

00:01:37.680 --> 00:01:41.300 
because any erratic movements can easily
throw<00:01:37.830> you<00:01:37.950> off<00:01:38.160> that's<00:01:39.030> right<00:01:39.270> so<00:01:39.630> one<00:01:40.070> as<00:01:41.070> far

myself flying we fly in accra mode which

00:01:45.060 --> 00:01:47.840 
myself flying we fly in accra mode which
is<00:01:45.180> just<00:01:45.270> basically<00:01:45.450> all<00:01:46.020> the<00:01:46.260> leveling<00:01:46.850> level

00:01:47.840 --> 00:01:47.850 
is just basically all the leveling level

00:01:47.850 --> 00:01:49.100 
is just basically all the leveling level
mode<00:01:48.030> and<00:01:48.210> items<00:01:48.540> that<00:01:48.570> all<00:01:48.810> that's<00:01:48.990> all

00:01:49.100 --> 00:01:49.110 
mode and items that all that's all

00:01:49.110 --> 00:01:50.870 
mode and items that all that's all
switched<00:01:49.380> off<00:01:49.560> so<00:01:50.130> basically<00:01:50.520> you're<00:01:50.760> in

00:01:50.870 --> 00:01:50.880 
switched off so basically you're in

00:01:50.880 --> 00:01:53.300 
switched off so basically you're in
control<00:01:51.300> of<00:01:51.570> the<00:01:52.020> actual<00:01:52.409> what<00:01:52.740> there<00:01:53.070> is<00:01:53.159> no

00:01:53.300 --> 00:01:53.310 
control of the actual what there is no

00:01:53.310 --> 00:01:55.040 
control of the actual what there is no
correction<00:01:53.820> happening<00:01:54.270> for<00:01:54.510> you<00:01:54.630> as<00:01:54.780> such<00:01:54.930> I

00:01:55.040 --> 00:01:55.050 
correction happening for you as such I

00:01:55.050 --> 00:01:57.770 
correction happening for you as such I
was<00:01:55.170> not<00:01:55.290> gonna<00:01:55.409> order<00:01:56.040> level<00:01:56.460> it's<00:01:57.450> it's

00:01:57.770 --> 00:01:57.780 
was not gonna order level it's it's

00:01:57.780 --> 00:01:59.899 
was not gonna order level it's it's
easier<00:01:58.110> flying<00:01:58.350> that<00:01:58.470> way<00:01:58.590> it's<00:01:58.680> not<00:01:58.800> oh<00:01:59.040> yes

00:01:59.899 --> 00:01:59.909 
easier flying that way it's not oh yes

00:01:59.909 --> 00:02:02.120 
easier flying that way it's not oh yes
harder<00:02:00.450> at<00:02:00.570> first<00:02:00.810> when<00:02:00.990> you're<00:02:01.110> learning<00:02:01.620> but

00:02:02.120 --> 00:02:02.130 
harder at first when you're learning but

00:02:02.130 --> 00:02:04.760 
harder at first when you're learning but
once<00:02:02.430> you<00:02:02.640> do<00:02:02.820> get<00:02:02.970> used<00:02:03.150> to<00:02:03.270> a<00:02:03.300> cur<00:02:03.450> it<00:02:03.990> is<00:02:04.350> way

00:02:04.760 --> 00:02:04.770 
once you do get used to a cur it is way

00:02:04.770 --> 00:02:06.860 
once you do get used to a cur it is way
easier<00:02:05.250> and<00:02:05.400> way<00:02:05.550> more<00:02:05.580> precise<00:02:06.090> that's<00:02:06.659> right

00:02:06.860 --> 00:02:06.870 
easier and way more precise that's right

00:02:06.870 --> 00:02:09.229 
easier and way more precise that's right
so<00:02:07.170> on<00:02:07.470> we're<00:02:08.280> basically<00:02:08.399> put<00:02:08.789> the<00:02:08.879> quad<00:02:09.090> where

00:02:09.229 --> 00:02:09.239 
so on we're basically put the quad where

00:02:09.239 --> 00:02:10.609 
so on we're basically put the quad where
we<00:02:09.330> want<00:02:09.509> to<00:02:09.629> with<00:02:09.780> look<00:02:09.899> it's<00:02:10.200> just<00:02:10.349> it's<00:02:10.560> just

00:02:10.609 --> 00:02:10.619 
we want to with look it's just it's just

00:02:10.619 --> 00:02:11.899 
we want to with look it's just it's just
a<00:02:10.769> bit<00:02:10.920> easier<00:02:11.190> to<00:02:11.280> fly<00:02:11.430> because<00:02:11.580> you're<00:02:11.819> not

00:02:11.899 --> 00:02:11.909 
a bit easier to fly because you're not

00:02:11.909 --> 00:02:15.080 
a bit easier to fly because you're not
fighting<00:02:12.150> the<00:02:13.340> flight<00:02:14.340> control<00:02:14.730> I<00:02:14.760> trying<00:02:15.030> to

00:02:15.080 --> 00:02:15.090 
fighting the flight control I trying to

00:02:15.090 --> 00:02:17.420 
fighting the flight control I trying to
stabilize<00:02:15.629> for<00:02:15.930> you<00:02:16.110> so<00:02:16.470> that's<00:02:17.040> the<00:02:17.129> mode<00:02:17.280> we

00:02:17.420 --> 00:02:17.430 
stabilize for you so that's the mode we

00:02:17.430 --> 00:02:18.920 
stabilize for you so that's the mode we
find<00:02:17.700> one<00:02:17.970> of<00:02:18.000> the<00:02:18.090> other<00:02:18.209> questions<00:02:18.360> i<00:02:18.690> had

00:02:18.920 --> 00:02:18.930 
find one of the other questions i had

00:02:18.930 --> 00:02:19.340 
find one of the other questions i had
was

00:02:19.340 --> 00:02:19.350 
was

00:02:19.350 --> 00:02:21.860 
was
when<00:02:20.130> they<00:02:20.220> doing<00:02:20.460> this<00:02:20.580> long<00:02:21.030> runs<00:02:21.330> how<00:02:21.660> do<00:02:21.720> we

00:02:21.860 --> 00:02:21.870 
when they doing this long runs how do we

00:02:21.870 --> 00:02:24.470 
when they doing this long runs how do we
maintain<00:02:22.050> altitude<00:02:22.590> etc<00:02:23.340> as<00:02:24.030> you<00:02:24.210> flying

00:02:24.470 --> 00:02:24.480 
maintain altitude etc as you flying

00:02:24.480 --> 00:02:26.390 
maintain altitude etc as you flying
faster<00:02:25.020> it's<00:02:25.140> actually<00:02:25.410> easier<00:02:25.890> controlling

00:02:26.390 --> 00:02:26.400 
faster it's actually easier controlling

00:02:26.400 --> 00:02:29.330 
faster it's actually easier controlling
altitude<00:02:26.760> would<00:02:26.970> you<00:02:27.060> say<00:02:27.320> yes<00:02:28.320> and<00:02:28.650> I'm<00:02:29.160> with

00:02:29.330 --> 00:02:29.340 
altitude would you say yes and I'm with

00:02:29.340 --> 00:02:31.370 
altitude would you say yes and I'm with
ron<00:02:29.490> was<00:02:29.640> not<00:02:29.670> well<00:02:30.390> yeah<00:02:30.630> we're<00:02:30.810> mainly<00:02:31.170> using

00:02:31.370 --> 00:02:31.380 
ron was not well yeah we're mainly using

00:02:31.380 --> 00:02:32.750 
ron was not well yeah we're mainly using
total<00:02:31.620> control<00:02:31.830> and<00:02:32.100> obviously<00:02:32.550> you're

00:02:32.750 --> 00:02:32.760 
total control and obviously you're

00:02:32.760 --> 00:02:35.510 
total control and obviously you're
flying<00:02:33.060> really<00:02:33.630> smoothly<00:02:34.080> so<00:02:34.500> for<00:02:35.220> me<00:02:35.370> it's

00:02:35.510 --> 00:02:35.520 
flying really smoothly so for me it's

00:02:35.520 --> 00:02:37.940 
flying really smoothly so for me it's
just<00:02:35.700> a<00:02:36.120> matter<00:02:36.300> of<00:02:36.390> trying<00:02:36.750> to<00:02:36.840> keep<00:02:37.770> my

00:02:37.940 --> 00:02:37.950 
just a matter of trying to keep my

00:02:37.950 --> 00:02:40.370 
just a matter of trying to keep my
relative<00:02:38.340> velocity<00:02:38.880> the<00:02:39.570> same<00:02:39.840> with<00:02:40.110> your

00:02:40.370 --> 00:02:40.380 
relative velocity the same with your

00:02:40.380 --> 00:02:41.930 
relative velocity the same with your
quad<00:02:40.620> so<00:02:41.280> yeah<00:02:41.400> it's<00:02:41.550> just<00:02:41.700> a<00:02:41.730> matter<00:02:41.850> of

00:02:41.930 --> 00:02:41.940 
quad so yeah it's just a matter of

00:02:41.940 --> 00:02:43.760 
quad so yeah it's just a matter of
trying<00:02:42.180> to<00:02:42.270> keep<00:02:42.510> the<00:02:42.780> throttle<00:02:43.200> control<00:02:43.620> as

00:02:43.760 --> 00:02:43.770 
trying to keep the throttle control as

00:02:43.770 --> 00:02:45.740 
trying to keep the throttle control as
smooth<00:02:44.010> as<00:02:44.130> possible<00:02:44.190> and<00:02:44.640> being<00:02:44.850> on<00:02:45.030> top<00:02:45.300> of<00:02:45.480> I

00:02:45.740 --> 00:02:45.750 
smooth as possible and being on top of I

00:02:45.750 --> 00:02:49.280 
smooth as possible and being on top of I
gains<00:02:46.650> in<00:02:46.860> altitude<00:02:47.220> and<00:02:47.840> drops<00:02:48.840> in<00:02:48.990> altitude

00:02:49.280 --> 00:02:49.290 
gains in altitude and drops in altitude

00:02:49.290 --> 00:02:51.080 
gains in altitude and drops in altitude
as<00:02:49.620> quickly<00:02:49.950> as<00:02:50.160> possible<00:02:50.220> before<00:02:50.820> they<00:02:50.940> get

00:02:51.080 --> 00:02:51.090 
as quickly as possible before they get

00:02:51.090 --> 00:02:54.260 
as quickly as possible before they get
out<00:02:51.240> of<00:02:51.360> hand<00:02:51.630> so<00:02:52.700> so<00:02:53.700> maintaining<00:02:54.120> altitude

00:02:54.260 --> 00:02:54.270 
out of hand so so maintaining altitude

00:02:54.270 --> 00:02:56.240 
out of hand so so maintaining altitude
here<00:02:54.810> I'm<00:02:54.930> just<00:02:54.960> basically<00:02:55.590> using<00:02:56.040> my

00:02:56.240 --> 00:02:56.250 
here I'm just basically using my

00:02:56.250 --> 00:02:58.160 
here I'm just basically using my
throttle<00:02:56.730> a<00:02:56.880> little<00:02:57.060> bit<00:02:57.480> of<00:02:57.570> pitch<00:02:57.750> control

00:02:58.160 --> 00:02:58.170 
throttle a little bit of pitch control

00:02:58.170 --> 00:02:59.630 
throttle a little bit of pitch control
but<00:02:58.320> not<00:02:58.470> very<00:02:58.650> much<00:02:58.890> at<00:02:58.950> all<00:02:59.190> it's<00:02:59.430> really

00:02:59.630 --> 00:02:59.640 
but not very much at all it's really

00:02:59.640 --> 00:03:01.160 
but not very much at all it's really
more<00:02:59.820> the<00:03:00.270> throttle<00:03:00.600> control<00:03:00.900> which<00:03:01.050> is

00:03:01.160 --> 00:03:01.170 
more the throttle control which is

00:03:01.170 --> 00:03:03.770 
more the throttle control which is
determining<00:03:01.710> my<00:03:01.830> altitude<00:03:02.160> here<00:03:02.520> so<00:03:03.480> one

00:03:03.770 --> 00:03:03.780 
determining my altitude here so one

00:03:03.780 --> 00:03:05.630 
determining my altitude here so one
that's<00:03:04.080> basically<00:03:04.920> the<00:03:05.040> way<00:03:05.220> we<00:03:05.430> go<00:03:05.610> about

00:03:05.630 --> 00:03:05.640 
that's basically the way we go about

00:03:05.640 --> 00:03:07.550 
that's basically the way we go about
doing<00:03:05.910> our<00:03:06.300> formation<00:03:06.840> flies<00:03:07.080> we're<00:03:07.320> still

00:03:07.550 --> 00:03:07.560 
doing our formation flies we're still

00:03:07.560 --> 00:03:09.080 
doing our formation flies we're still
learning<00:03:07.800> we're<00:03:08.100> still<00:03:08.280> getting<00:03:08.460> better<00:03:08.790> at

00:03:09.080 --> 00:03:09.090 
learning we're still getting better at

00:03:09.090 --> 00:03:12.650 
learning we're still getting better at
me<00:03:09.210> ah<00:03:09.500> yes<00:03:10.500> with<00:03:11.040> basically<00:03:11.700> proving<00:03:12.360> every

00:03:12.650 --> 00:03:12.660 
me ah yes with basically proving every

00:03:12.660 --> 00:03:14.810 
me ah yes with basically proving every
time<00:03:12.870> we<00:03:13.050> go<00:03:13.470> out<00:03:13.500> to<00:03:13.770> do<00:03:13.890> it<00:03:14.040> Thomas<00:03:14.460> is<00:03:14.550> really

00:03:14.810 --> 00:03:14.820 
time we go out to do it Thomas is really

00:03:14.820 --> 00:03:16.220 
time we go out to do it Thomas is really
good<00:03:14.970> at<00:03:15.060> falling<00:03:15.330> because<00:03:15.690> he's<00:03:15.960> done<00:03:16.110> a<00:03:16.140> hell

00:03:16.220 --> 00:03:16.230 
good at falling because he's done a hell

00:03:16.230 --> 00:03:18.110 
good at falling because he's done a hell
of<00:03:16.410> a<00:03:16.560> lot<00:03:16.620> more<00:03:16.710> more<00:03:17.430> more<00:03:17.820> of<00:03:17.940> that<00:03:18.060> than

00:03:18.110 --> 00:03:18.120 
of a lot more more more of that than

00:03:18.120 --> 00:03:20.750 
of a lot more more more of that than
what<00:03:18.360> I<00:03:18.390> have<00:03:18.690> and<00:03:19.530> I<00:03:19.620> tend<00:03:20.070> to<00:03:20.130> be<00:03:20.280> better<00:03:20.520> at

00:03:20.750 --> 00:03:20.760 
what I have and I tend to be better at

00:03:29.060 --> 00:03:29.070 
this is basically my landing approach on

00:03:29.070 --> 00:03:30.320 
this is basically my landing approach on
coming<00:03:29.400> in<00:03:29.490> for<00:03:29.640> landing<00:03:29.760> as<00:03:30.000> you<00:03:30.090> can<00:03:30.240> said

00:03:30.320 --> 00:03:30.330

00:03:34.460 --> 00:03:34.470 
batteries were going to float pretty

00:03:34.470 --> 00:03:37.010 
batteries were going to float pretty
quick<00:03:34.790> also<00:03:35.790> we're<00:03:35.970> taking<00:03:36.420> people<00:03:36.720> up<00:03:36.840> for

one top actually land because if Thomas

00:03:40.380 --> 00:03:43.940 
one top actually land because if Thomas
go<00:03:40.530> into<00:03:40.890> his<00:03:41.100> own<00:03:42.050> flying<00:03:43.050> style<00:03:43.470> mode<00:03:43.680> and

00:03:43.940 --> 00:03:43.950 
go into his own flying style mode and

00:03:43.950 --> 00:03:45.440 
go into his own flying style mode and
he's<00:03:44.160> actually<00:03:44.370> gonna<00:03:44.670> get<00:03:44.910> around<00:03:45.180> and<00:03:45.390> you

00:03:45.440 --> 00:03:45.450 
he's actually gonna get around and you

00:03:45.450 --> 00:03:47.780 
he's actually gonna get around and you
can<00:03:45.570> just<00:03:45.720> see<00:03:45.810> the<00:03:46.230> way<00:03:47.040> he's<00:03:47.250> actually<00:03:47.430> flies

00:03:47.780 --> 00:03:47.790 
can just see the way he's actually flies

00:03:47.790 --> 00:03:50.090 
can just see the way he's actually flies
really<00:03:48.090> expressing<00:03:48.870> his<00:03:49.080> own<00:03:49.350> flying

00:03:50.090 --> 00:03:50.100 
really expressing his own flying

00:03:50.100 --> 00:03:51.530 
really expressing his own flying
characteristics<00:03:50.610> that<00:03:50.970> the<00:03:51.210> way<00:03:51.300> you<00:03:51.360> would

00:03:51.530 --> 00:03:51.540 
characteristics that the way you would

00:03:51.540 --> 00:03:54.020 
characteristics that the way you would
describe<00:03:51.750> it<00:03:51.930> um<00:03:52.650> yeah<00:03:53.130> I<00:03:53.160> guess<00:03:53.280> so<00:03:53.610> it's<00:03:53.790> just

00:03:54.020 --> 00:03:54.030 
describe it um yeah I guess so it's just

00:03:54.030 --> 00:03:56.090 
describe it um yeah I guess so it's just
more<00:03:54.270> me<00:03:54.720> just<00:03:54.990> opening<00:03:55.560> up<00:03:55.650> doing<00:03:55.920> whatever

00:03:56.090 --> 00:03:56.100 
more me just opening up doing whatever

00:03:56.100 --> 00:03:58.640 
more me just opening up doing whatever
and<00:03:56.700> just<00:03:56.850> going<00:03:57.720> with<00:03:57.840> the<00:03:57.900> flow<00:03:57.990> isn't<00:03:58.320> it<00:03:58.470> uh

00:03:58.640 --> 00:03:58.650 
and just going with the flow isn't it uh

00:03:58.650 --> 00:04:01.400 
and just going with the flow isn't it uh
yeah<00:03:59.520> very<00:03:59.790> much<00:04:00.030> just<00:04:00.300> really<00:04:00.660> experimenting

00:04:01.400 --> 00:04:01.410 
yeah very much just really experimenting

00:04:01.410 --> 00:04:03.860 
yeah very much just really experimenting
with<00:04:01.440> different<00:04:01.590> things<00:04:01.950> and<00:04:02.340> yes<00:04:03.090> I<00:04:03.510> guess

00:04:03.860 --> 00:04:03.870 
with different things and yes I guess

00:04:03.870 --> 00:04:05.630 
with different things and yes I guess
having<00:04:04.050> a<00:04:04.170> play<00:04:04.350> look<00:04:04.980> all<00:04:05.100> the<00:04:05.190> law<00:04:05.340> was

00:04:05.630 --> 00:04:05.640 
having a play look all the law was

00:04:05.640 --> 00:04:08.030 
having a play look all the law was
