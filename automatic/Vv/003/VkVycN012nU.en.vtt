 the firm commitment of the Ministry of Development to promote a network 

00:00:12.669 --> 00:00:17.110
 Barcelona quality railway and its metropolitan area has a new 

00:00:17.109 --> 00:00:20.109
 exponent the meridian sagrera station 

00:00:21.810 --> 00:00:25.810
 With an investment of more than 34 million euros, a 

00:00:25.810 --> 00:00:29.689

 future of public transport in the Catalan capital 

00:00:33.290 --> 00:00:37.720
 an underground station of almost five thousand square meters modern safe 

00:00:37.720 --> 00:00:42.170
 functional and accessible and that encourage intermodality between the exits and metro 

00:00:43.280 --> 00:00:47.400
 the new facilities are located inside the tunnel that runs under the 

00:00:47.400 --> 00:00:49.750
 avenue of the meridiana 

00:00:49.750 --> 00:00:52.750
 its construction has involved a great effort of planning 

00:00:53.360 --> 00:00:56.790
 When it is necessary to act on railway infrastructures, 

00:00:56.790 --> 00:01:00.210
 service and in a densely urbanized area

 the effects on both surface and royalty users 

00:01:05.960 --> 00:01:08.970
 Although the complexity of the proceedings made it necessary to 

00:01:08.970 --> 00:01:11.230
 service interruption

 new configuration 

00:01:21.470 --> 00:01:23.859
 the tunnel has been transformed complete 

00:01:23.859 --> 00:01:26.859
 although modifying its depth height and width 

00:01:27.590 --> 00:01:31.040
 for this it has been necessary to demolish 100 thousand cubic meters of the vault 

00:01:31.040 --> 00:01:32.930
 existing 

00:01:32.930 --> 00:01:35.760
 the 5 thousand cubic meters of land 

00:01:35.760 --> 00:01:38.200
 It has also been mounted via plate 

00:01:38.200 --> 00:01:41.930
 that incorporates systems to reduce the acoustic impact and vibrations 

00:01:41.930 --> 00:01:45.380
 generated by rail traffic 

00:01:45.380 --> 00:01:48.650
 this tunnel completely renovated 

00:01:48.650 --> 00:01:52.850
 the central and underground 200 meters long and more than 6 meters wide 

00:01:53.490 --> 00:01:57.320
 its height facilitates a totally safe and comfortable access to trains 

00:01:58.250 --> 00:02:01.540
 in the upper level two halls have been created 

00:02:01.540 --> 00:02:04.770
 one of them located on the avenue de la meridiana 

00:02:04.770 --> 00:02:08.169
 make possible the exchange with the fundamental ideas

 what do you want and the future market l4 

00:02:11.819 --> 00:02:16.140
 the second in the street martín prinz is exclusive of rail service 

00:02:16.709 --> 00:02:20.039
 for the next round 3 days 

00:02:20.039 --> 00:02:21.799
 7 and 12 

00:02:21.799 --> 00:02:25.559
 both have fixed and mechanical stairs and elevators what 

00:02:25.559 --> 00:02:28.419
 guarantee full accessibility 

00:02:28.419 --> 00:02:33.389
 a large-scale work in the Ministry of Development through 16 

00:02:33.389 --> 00:02:37.509
 has been committed to guarantee the safety of nearby buildings and 

00:02:37.509 --> 00:02:40.370
