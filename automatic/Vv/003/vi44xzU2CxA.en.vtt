00:00:05.220 --> 00:00:11.730
 rather tell you about what you can 

00:00:09.150 --> 00:00:14.820
 make of the old garage in this 

00:00:11.730 --> 00:00:17.820
 the moment we are in the old garage 

00:00:14.820 --> 00:00:22.050
 we made a bath out of it 

00:00:17.820 --> 00:00:24.050
 let's see what we have now I 

00:00:22.050 --> 00:00:30.330
 go out 

00:00:24.050 --> 00:00:34.850
 here we are on the street here with us 

00:00:30.330 --> 00:00:50.300
 waiting room here behind this door with us 

00:00:34.850 --> 00:00:55.370
 the toilet here we have heating comes 

00:00:50.300 --> 00:00:59.660
 return hot hot water 

00:00:55.370 --> 00:01:04.530
 supply of heat and water 

00:00:59.660 --> 00:01:07.770
 from home let's move on as I 

00:01:04.530 --> 00:01:09.990
 He said this already with the bath a little bit 

00:01:07.770 --> 00:01:15.509
 tidied up here constantly walk 

00:01:09.990 --> 00:01:17.700
 have so in this niche we 

00:01:15.509 --> 00:01:21.750
 there was a washing machine but since the house 

00:01:17.700 --> 00:01:24.960
 built a washing machine moved into 

00:01:21.750 --> 00:01:34.220
 house but niche left think about it 

00:01:24.960 --> 00:01:34.220
 use wood stove 

00:01:36.380 --> 00:01:44.990
 this flap two pieces there pipe 

00:01:41.790 --> 00:01:49.170
 passes 4 

00:01:44.990 --> 00:01:53.810
 let's go with flour bath sauna with us 

00:01:49.170 --> 00:01:53.810
 it turned out like this 

00:01:54.470 --> 00:02:03.509
 heating you see water pipes 

00:01:58.920 --> 00:02:06.119
 everything comes from home that is dug up 

00:02:03.509 --> 00:02:08.750
 line at a depth of 50 centimeters 

00:02:06.119 --> 00:02:14.760
 practically that is it warmed 

00:02:08.750 --> 00:02:17.390
 never froze okay rain all 

00:02:14.760 --> 00:02:17.390
 is functioning 

00:02:17.810 --> 00:02:28.100
 I will show you here so 

00:02:21.360 --> 00:02:28.100
 made out of sauna sauna whispered share 

00:02:28.940 --> 00:02:38.250
 here is a stove with a stove 

00:02:35.780 --> 00:02:44.280
 I would especially like to linger of course 

00:02:38.250 --> 00:02:47.030
 Here are the designs of this shelf shelves made 

00:02:44.280 --> 00:02:47.030
 from lime and 

00:02:48.019 --> 00:02:55.370
 I can say the bearing structures 

00:02:51.349 --> 00:03:02.430
 rolled out of metal profiles and 

00:02:55.370 --> 00:03:07.049
 show that is a tin box with 

00:03:02.430 --> 00:03:09.150
 the profile inside it passes the timber and the whole 

00:03:07.049 --> 00:03:13.590
 construction assembled on profiles 

00:03:09.150 --> 00:03:15.650
 with strengthening rusami perfectly keeps 

00:03:13.590 --> 00:03:19.140
 if anyone has no desire 

00:03:15.650 --> 00:03:22.069
 I look at the construction somehow 

00:03:19.140 --> 00:03:24.920
 there will be questions light down there 

00:03:22.069 --> 00:03:27.690
 I will photograph and lay out if necessary 

00:03:24.920 --> 00:03:30.260
 the design is very tough three people 

00:03:27.690 --> 00:03:35.430
 here sit freely do not even budge 

00:03:30.260 --> 00:03:36.000
 the second point is such a glass 

00:03:35.430 --> 00:03:39.980
 a door 

00:03:36.000 --> 00:03:43.139
 why two glass like but 

00:03:39.980 --> 00:03:47.430
 dear yes dear door well let's 

00:03:43.139 --> 00:03:48.150
 pay attention to this door 

00:03:47.430 --> 00:03:51.329
 there is too 

00:03:48.150 --> 00:03:53.040
 this cheap budget option was 

00:03:51.329 --> 00:03:56.370
 bought simply because there was nothing 

00:03:53.040 --> 00:03:59.549
 more too linden repeatedly 

00:03:56.370 --> 00:04:02.459
 reworked we have already rolled up 

00:03:59.549 --> 00:04:05.069
 but see it all cracks 

00:04:02.459 --> 00:04:08.480
 as if I was not fixed 

00:04:05.069 --> 00:04:12.470
 that is, this is all 

00:04:08.480 --> 00:04:15.239
 it turns out to be normalized 

00:04:12.470 --> 00:04:19.400
 deal at the same time glass 

00:04:15.239 --> 00:04:22.019
 door bought together with this 

00:04:19.400 --> 00:04:25.830
 closes no gaps any 

00:04:22.019 --> 00:04:30.030
 sagging glass does not lead see 

00:04:25.830 --> 00:04:31.830
 I recommend no glass bid 

00:04:30.030 --> 00:04:35.070
 but it is pure glass door 

00:04:31.830 --> 00:04:39.270
 well proven not 

00:04:35.070 --> 00:04:44.240
 be afraid that it will break that is how 

00:04:39.270 --> 00:04:50.759
 only we are here and the children play with us run 

00:04:44.240 --> 00:04:56.400
 no no no cracks in general without 

00:04:50.759 --> 00:05:02.520
 complaints beautiful thing well what else 

00:04:56.400 --> 00:05:08.130
 wanted to say all the walls both here and in 

00:05:02.520 --> 00:05:12.860
 the sauna is sheathed rather under the clapboard stitched 

00:05:08.130 --> 00:05:17.780
 reflective film outside warmed 

00:05:12.860 --> 00:05:20.550
 mineral wool mineral wool and sheathed with siding 

00:05:17.780 --> 00:05:26.039
 on the roof on the roof we laid 

00:05:20.550 --> 00:05:28.610
 first halfwat but then it turned out 

00:05:26.039 --> 00:05:31.880
 that a lot of sawdust was and sawdust we 

00:05:28.610 --> 00:05:38.009
 we put on the roof of the mineral pool we use 

00:05:31.880 --> 00:05:42.979
 where it is necessary in the household everywhere she is not 

00:05:38.009 --> 00:05:45.990
 Well, well, on this I would like 

00:05:42.979 --> 00:05:49.969
 say goodbye if you have questions please 

00:05:45.990 --> 00:05:49.969
 ask thanks
