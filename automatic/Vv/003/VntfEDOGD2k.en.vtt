00:01:00.380 --> 00:01:00.390 
that's like blue loop I think a lot of

00:01:00.390 --> 00:01:02.270 
that's like blue loop I think a lot of
it<00:01:00.480> has<00:01:00.600> to<00:01:00.629> do<00:01:00.840> with<00:01:00.989> that<00:01:01.020> with<00:01:01.980> the<00:01:02.070> little

00:01:02.270 --> 00:01:02.280 
it has to do with that with the little

00:01:02.280 --> 00:01:03.650 
it has to do with that with the little
quick<00:01:02.489> scoping<00:01:02.820> delay<00:01:03.090> they<00:01:03.239> put<00:01:03.420> on<00:01:03.539> these

00:01:03.650 --> 00:01:03.660 
quick scoping delay they put on these

00:01:03.660 --> 00:01:06.469 
quick scoping delay they put on these
things<00:01:03.949> it<00:01:04.949> makes<00:01:05.220> them<00:01:05.400> unusable<00:01:05.850> in<00:01:06.360> a

00:01:06.469 --> 00:01:06.479 
things it makes them unusable in a

00:01:06.479 --> 00:01:08.510 
things it makes them unusable in a
fast-paced<00:01:06.869> environment<00:01:07.170> for<00:01:07.979> the<00:01:08.040> most<00:01:08.280> part

00:01:08.510 --> 00:01:08.520 
fast-paced environment for the most part

00:01:08.520 --> 00:01:11.149 
fast-paced environment for the most part
and<00:01:08.820> you<00:01:09.780> know<00:01:09.930> this<00:01:10.439> game<00:01:10.650> you<00:01:10.860> don't<00:01:10.950> have<00:01:11.130> a

00:01:11.149 --> 00:01:11.159 
and you know this game you don't have a

00:01:11.159 --> 00:01:12.440 
and you know this game you don't have a
lot<00:01:11.310> of<00:01:11.340> people<00:01:11.610> running<00:01:11.760> right<00:01:12.119> down<00:01:12.150> the

00:01:12.440 --> 00:01:12.450 
lot of people running right down the

00:01:12.450 --> 00:01:14.030 
lot of people running right down the
middle<00:01:12.479> of<00:01:12.780> at<00:01:12.900> least<00:01:12.990> in<00:01:13.200> most<00:01:13.320> cases<00:01:13.619> so<00:01:13.950> you

00:01:14.030 --> 00:01:14.040 
middle of at least in most cases so you

00:01:14.040 --> 00:01:16.700 
middle of at least in most cases so you
don't<00:01:14.310> you<00:01:14.610> don't<00:01:15.000> get<00:01:15.119> like<00:01:15.299> tons<00:01:16.200> of<00:01:16.380> open

00:01:16.700 --> 00:01:16.710 
don't you don't get like tons of open

00:01:16.710 --> 00:01:18.890 
don't you don't get like tons of open
shots<00:01:16.979> and<00:01:17.340> the<00:01:18.210> maps<00:01:18.450> are<00:01:18.659> not<00:01:18.689> really

00:01:18.890 --> 00:01:18.900 
shots and the maps are not really

00:01:18.900 --> 00:01:23.300 
shots and the maps are not really
designed<00:01:19.290> to<00:01:21.290> kind<00:01:22.290> of<00:01:22.320> like<00:01:22.439> terminal<00:01:22.920> um<00:01:23.070> if

00:01:23.300 --> 00:01:23.310 
designed to kind of like terminal um if

00:01:23.310 --> 00:01:25.160 
designed to kind of like terminal um if
you<00:01:23.430> don't<00:01:23.460> talking<00:01:23.880> about<00:01:24.090> terminal<00:01:24.930> you

00:01:25.160 --> 00:01:25.170 
you don't talking about terminal you

00:01:25.170 --> 00:01:26.810 
you don't talking about terminal you
basically<00:01:25.710> you<00:01:25.950> knew<00:01:26.189> people<00:01:26.430> would<00:01:26.490> run<00:01:26.670> down

00:01:26.810 --> 00:01:26.820 
basically you knew people would run down

00:01:26.820 --> 00:01:28.340 
basically you knew people would run down
that<00:01:26.850> middle<00:01:27.210> hallway<00:01:27.420> in<00:01:27.630> that<00:01:27.780> library<00:01:27.960> so

00:01:28.340 --> 00:01:28.350 
that middle hallway in that library so

00:01:28.350 --> 00:01:29.929 
that middle hallway in that library so
you<00:01:28.409> can<00:01:28.530> just<00:01:28.560> aim<00:01:29.009> up<00:01:29.310> at<00:01:29.430> that<00:01:29.579> the<00:01:29.700> entire

00:01:29.929 --> 00:01:29.939 
you can just aim up at that the entire

00:01:29.939 --> 00:01:32.929 
you can just aim up at that the entire
time<00:01:30.619> there's<00:01:31.619> a<00:01:31.799> nice<00:01:32.100> second<00:01:32.460> chance<00:01:32.700> kill

age<00:02:08.630> video<00:02:08.899> up<00:02:09.050> yesterday<00:02:09.500> mainly<00:02:10.399> because<00:02:10.429> I

00:02:10.779 --> 00:02:10.789 
age video up yesterday mainly because I

00:02:10.789 --> 00:02:16.000 
age video up yesterday mainly because I
was<00:02:11.360> doing<00:02:11.450> a<00:02:11.600> batch<00:02:11.780> render<00:02:12.080> and<00:02:12.760> I<00:02:15.010> batch

00:02:16.000 --> 00:02:16.010 
was doing a batch render and I batch

00:02:16.010 --> 00:02:19.030 
was doing a batch render and I batch
render<00:02:16.250> files<00:02:16.580> all<00:02:16.880> together<00:02:17.030> so<00:02:17.860> it<00:02:18.860> took

00:02:19.030 --> 00:02:19.040 
render files all together so it took

00:02:19.040 --> 00:02:20.830 
render files all together so it took
longer<00:02:19.100> than<00:02:19.459> expected<00:02:19.610> and<00:02:20.180> I<00:02:20.570> fell<00:02:20.810> asleep

than<00:03:08.950> the<00:03:09.100> pave<00:03:09.310> low<00:03:09.520> because<00:03:10.360> you're<00:03:10.690> more<00:03:10.930> on

00:03:11.100 --> 00:03:11.110

than the pave low because you're more on
average<00:03:11.440> will<00:03:11.560> get<00:03:11.680> more<00:03:11.860> kills<00:03:12.070> because<00:03:12.250> your

00:03:12.450 --> 00:03:12.460 
average will get more kills because your

00:03:12.460 --> 00:03:15.840 
average will get more kills because your
self<00:03:12.700> controlled<00:03:13.170> but<00:03:14.170> 49<00:03:14.560> kill<00:03:14.890> streak<00:03:15.220> it<00:03:15.400> is
