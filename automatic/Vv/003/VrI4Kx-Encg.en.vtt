00:01:49.320 --> 00:01:50.569 
higher and surprisingly Casey's not that
great<00:01:49.590> against<00:01:49.950> the<00:01:50.040> run<00:01:50.220> it<00:01:50.340> believes

00:01:50.569 --> 00:01:50.579 
great against the run it believes

00:01:50.579 --> 00:01:51.740 
great against the run it believes
they're<00:01:50.700> like<00:01:50.820> twenty<00:01:51.119> first<00:01:51.329> against<00:01:51.689> the

00:01:51.740 --> 00:01:51.750

they're like twenty first against the
run<00:01:52.049> so<00:01:52.530> the<00:01:52.680> reason<00:01:52.860> Casey's<00:01:53.430> fancy<00:01:53.970> defense

00:01:54.440 --> 00:01:54.450 
run so the reason Casey's fancy defense

00:01:54.450 --> 00:01:56.179 
run so the reason Casey's fancy defense
is<00:01:54.600> so<00:01:54.720> good<00:01:54.930> it's<00:01:55.110> the<00:01:55.259> saxes<00:01:55.710> to<00:01:55.829> turn<00:01:56.009> over

00:01:56.179 --> 00:01:56.189 
is so good it's the saxes to turn over

00:01:57.889 --> 00:01:57.899 
it's all of those goodies but in terms

00:01:57.899 --> 00:01:59.990

00:02:39.160 --> 00:02:39.170 
do think Casey's defense will be able to

00:02:39.170 --> 00:02:41.380 
do think Casey's defense will be able to

00:02:41.380 --> 00:02:41.390 
keep that game in check to the point to

00:02:41.390 --> 00:02:43.390 
keep that game in check to the point to
where<00:02:41.560> they're<00:02:42.560> not<00:02:42.710> going<00:02:42.860> to<00:02:42.920> need<00:02:43.100> Alex

00:02:47.350 --> 00:02:47.360 
me for Alex Smith a little bit I know

00:02:47.360 --> 00:02:48.670 
me for Alex Smith a little bit I know
he's<00:02:47.480> been<00:02:47.570> having<00:02:47.870> a<00:02:47.930> good<00:02:48.080> stretch<00:02:48.410> but

00:02:48.670 --> 00:02:48.680 
he's been having a good stretch but

00:02:48.680 --> 00:02:50.560 
he's been having a good stretch but
Russell<00:02:49.490> Wilson<00:02:49.790> I<00:02:49.850> know<00:02:50.000> that<00:02:50.180> was<00:02:50.330> a<00:02:50.360> great

00:02:50.560 --> 00:02:50.570 
Russell Wilson I know that was a great

00:02:50.570 --> 00:02:52.480 
Russell Wilson I know that was a great
game<00:02:50.690> but<00:02:51.170> that<00:02:51.350> was<00:02:51.500> in<00:02:51.650> seattle<00:02:52.160> now<00:02:52.190> they're

00:02:52.480 --> 00:02:52.490 
game but that was in seattle now they're

00:02:52.490 --> 00:02:54.910 
game but that was in seattle now they're
in<00:02:52.610> San<00:02:52.820> Francisco<00:02:53.000> he<00:02:53.840> spends<00:02:54.170> good<00:02:54.650> this

00:02:54.910 --> 00:02:54.920 
in San Francisco he spends good this

00:02:54.920 --> 00:02:58.270 
in San Francisco he spends good this
year<00:02:55.060> but<00:02:56.060> not<00:02:56.330> a<00:02:56.660> no-brainer<00:02:57.560> starter<00:02:58.070> and

00:02:58.270 --> 00:02:58.280 
year but not a no-brainer starter and

00:02:58.280 --> 00:03:01.360 
year but not a no-brainer starter and
it's<00:02:58.970> extremely<00:02:59.570> scary<00:03:00.020> to<00:03:00.320> put<00:03:00.560> your<00:03:00.740> fantasy

00:03:01.360 --> 00:03:01.370 
it's extremely scary to put your fantasy

00:03:01.370 --> 00:03:03.070 
it's extremely scary to put your fantasy
lights<00:03:01.640> in<00:03:01.880> the<00:03:02.000> hands<00:03:02.300> of<00:03:02.330> a<00:03:02.420> guy<00:03:02.600> coming<00:03:02.900> off

00:03:03.070 --> 00:03:03.080 
lights in the hands of a guy coming off

00:03:03.080 --> 00:03:04.900 
lights in the hands of a guy coming off
an<00:03:03.260> injury<00:03:03.380> but<00:03:03.740> I<00:03:03.770> think<00:03:04.160> you<00:03:04.310> should<00:03:04.550> go<00:03:04.730> with

00:03:04.900 --> 00:03:04.910 
an injury but I think you should go with

00:03:04.910 --> 00:03:07.330 
an injury but I think you should go with
the<00:03:05.030> Chicago<00:03:05.570> the<00:03:06.110> matchups<00:03:06.620> great<00:03:06.890> that<00:03:07.160> game

00:03:07.330 --> 00:03:07.340 
the Chicago the matchups great that game

00:03:07.340 --> 00:03:09.790 
the Chicago the matchups great that game
could<00:03:07.610> be<00:03:07.730> a<00:03:07.760> shootout<00:03:08.350> wait<00:03:09.350> and<00:03:09.500> see<00:03:09.620> how<00:03:09.770> the

00:03:09.790 --> 00:03:09.800 
could be a shootout wait and see how the

00:03:09.800 --> 00:03:11.800 
could be a shootout wait and see how the
reports<00:03:10.280> are<00:03:10.340> looking<00:03:10.670> but<00:03:10.850> I<00:03:11.150> think<00:03:11.570> you<00:03:11.660> go

00:03:11.800 --> 00:03:11.810 
reports are looking but I think you go

00:03:11.810 --> 00:03:13.360 
reports are looking but I think you go
with<00:03:11.960> whoever<00:03:12.110> starts<00:03:12.560> for<00:03:12.710> the<00:03:12.770> Bears<00:03:12.980> and<00:03:13.160> I

00:03:13.360 --> 00:03:13.370 
with whoever starts for the Bears and I

00:03:13.370 --> 00:03:14.890 
with whoever starts for the Bears and I
think<00:03:13.610> the<00:03:13.730> best<00:03:13.970> change<00:03:14.240> would<00:03:14.420> be<00:03:14.450> of<00:03:14.570> colors

00:03:14.890 --> 00:03:14.900 
think the best change would be of colors

00:03:14.900 --> 00:03:16.960 
think the best change would be of colors
rule<00:03:15.110> out<00:03:15.230> like<00:03:15.470> now<00:03:15.800> and<00:03:16.220> then<00:03:16.520> you<00:03:16.610> can<00:03:16.760> start

00:03:16.960 --> 00:03:16.970 
rule out like now and then you can start

00:03:16.970 --> 00:03:19.720 
rule out like now and then you can start
I<00:03:17.270> would<00:03:17.960> actually<00:03:18.140> rather<00:03:18.680> Cutler<00:03:19.280> not<00:03:19.490> play

00:03:19.720 --> 00:03:19.730 
I would actually rather Cutler not play

00:03:19.730 --> 00:03:21.850 
I would actually rather Cutler not play
in<00:03:19.760> and<00:03:20.000> be<00:03:20.120> my<00:03:20.270> town<00:03:20.510> yeah<00:03:21.020> I'm<00:03:21.440> on<00:03:21.590> the<00:03:21.680> same

00:03:21.850 --> 00:03:21.860

Tennessee<00:04:29.350> is<00:04:29.620> the<00:04:29.949> toughest<00:04:30.430> against

00:04:30.960 --> 00:04:30.970 
Tennessee is the toughest against

00:04:30.970 --> 00:04:32.640 
Tennessee is the toughest against
fantasy<00:04:31.660> receivers<00:04:32.110> which<00:04:32.260> is<00:04:32.380> kind<00:04:32.590> of

00:04:32.640 --> 00:04:32.650 
fantasy receivers which is kind of

00:04:32.650 --> 00:04:34.409 
fantasy receivers which is kind of
surprising<00:04:32.770> it<00:04:33.340> doesn't<00:04:33.610> really<00:04:33.699> necessarily

00:04:34.409 --> 00:04:34.419 
surprising it doesn't really necessarily

00:04:34.419 --> 00:04:36.180 
surprising it doesn't really necessarily
you<00:04:34.840> wouldn't<00:04:35.139> pick<00:04:35.290> them<00:04:35.530> as<00:04:35.680> a<00:04:35.710> team<00:04:35.830> that's

00:04:36.180 --> 00:04:36.190 
you wouldn't pick them as a team that's

00:04:36.190 --> 00:04:38.610 
you wouldn't pick them as a team that's
that<00:04:36.370> good<00:04:36.550> against<00:04:36.940> receivers<00:04:37.389> but<00:04:37.620> it's

00:04:38.610 --> 00:04:38.620 
that good against receivers but it's

00:04:38.620 --> 00:04:41.010 
that good against receivers but it's
just<00:04:38.979> scary<00:04:39.070> to<00:04:39.400> me<00:04:39.580> I<00:04:39.729> think<00:04:40.150> that<00:04:40.539> game<00:04:40.810> can

00:04:41.010 --> 00:04:41.020 
just scary to me I think that game can

00:04:41.020 --> 00:04:44.670 
just scary to me I think that game can
be<00:04:41.050> very<00:04:41.380> easily<00:04:41.620> in<00:04:42.039> control<00:04:42.490> early<00:04:43.680> probably

00:04:44.670 --> 00:04:44.680 
be very easily in control early probably

00:04:44.680 --> 00:04:46.320 
be very easily in control early probably
will<00:04:45.190> be<00:04:45.370> and<00:04:45.639> I<00:04:45.729> don't<00:04:45.789> think<00:04:45.970> they'll

00:04:46.320 --> 00:04:46.330 
will be and I don't think they'll

00:04:46.330 --> 00:04:48.120 
will be and I don't think they'll
necessarily<00:04:46.900> need<00:04:47.110> the<00:04:47.260> past<00:04:47.470> that<00:04:47.710> much<00:04:47.889> and

00:04:48.120 --> 00:04:48.130 
necessarily need the past that much and

00:04:48.130 --> 00:04:50.580 
necessarily need the past that much and
that's<00:04:48.610> why<00:04:48.850> my<00:04:49.030> sleepers<00:04:49.539> monta<00:04:50.020> ball<00:04:50.289> going

00:04:50.580 --> 00:04:50.590 
that's why my sleepers monta ball going

00:04:50.590 --> 00:04:52.860 
that's why my sleepers monta ball going
up<00:04:50.800> against<00:04:51.160> Tennessee<00:04:51.550> Tennessee<00:04:52.210> gives<00:04:52.720> up

00:04:52.860 --> 00:04:52.870 
up against Tennessee Tennessee gives up

00:04:52.870 --> 00:04:55.230 
up against Tennessee Tennessee gives up
a<00:04:52.960> lot<00:04:53.229> of<00:04:53.260> points<00:04:53.710> two<00:04:53.830> running<00:04:54.160> backs<00:04:54.240> Moreno

goes<00:05:00.479> Denver<00:05:01.479> gets<00:05:01.750> up<00:05:01.960> early<00:05:02.460> they<00:05:03.460> run

00:05:03.840 --> 00:05:03.850 
goes Denver gets up early they run

00:05:03.850 --> 00:05:05.939 
goes Denver gets up early they run
montee<00:05:04.449> ball<00:05:04.479> as<00:05:04.930> long<00:05:05.080> as<00:05:05.229> he<00:05:05.380> doesn't<00:05:05.620> fumble

00:05:05.939 --> 00:05:05.949 
montee ball as long as he doesn't fumble

00:05:05.949 --> 00:05:08.820 
montee ball as long as he doesn't fumble
I<00:05:06.370> think<00:05:07.330> he<00:05:07.419> has<00:05:07.570> a<00:05:07.600> high<00:05:07.900> ceiling<00:05:08.440> this<00:05:08.620> week

00:05:08.820 --> 00:05:08.830 
I think he has a high ceiling this week

00:05:08.830 --> 00:05:10.680 
I think he has a high ceiling this week
I<00:05:09.010> think<00:05:09.220> definitely<00:05:09.430> potential<00:05:10.240> over<00:05:10.630> a

00:05:10.680 --> 00:05:10.690 
I think definitely potential over a

00:05:10.690 --> 00:05:12.390 
I think definitely potential over a
hundred<00:05:10.900> yards<00:05:11.289> they<00:05:11.650> like<00:05:11.860> him<00:05:11.979> in<00:05:12.130> the<00:05:12.220> red

00:05:12.390 --> 00:05:12.400 
hundred yards they like him in the red

00:05:12.400 --> 00:05:14.790 
hundred yards they like him in the red
zone<00:05:12.430> he<00:05:12.729> could<00:05:12.880> give<00:05:13.060> the<00:05:13.180> end<00:05:13.300> zone<00:05:13.800> it's

00:05:14.790 --> 00:05:14.800 
zone he could give the end zone it's

00:05:14.800 --> 00:05:18.120 
zone he could give the end zone it's
scary<00:05:15.099> explores<00:05:15.940> very<00:05:16.570> low<00:05:16.810> though<00:05:17.110> I<00:05:17.410> think

00:05:18.120 --> 00:05:18.130 
scary explores very low though I think

00:05:18.130 --> 00:05:20.790 
scary explores very low though I think
so<00:05:18.460> it's<00:05:18.820> scary<00:05:19.330> but<00:05:19.630> there's<00:05:19.990> certainly<00:05:20.470> some

00:05:20.790 --> 00:05:20.800 
so it's scary but there's certainly some

00:05:20.800 --> 00:05:23.070 
so it's scary but there's certainly some
flex<00:05:21.099> appeal<00:05:21.280> there<00:05:21.760> and<00:05:22.510> then<00:05:22.690> my<00:05:22.840> deep

00:05:23.070 --> 00:05:23.080 
flex appeal there and then my deep

00:05:23.080 --> 00:05:25.020 
flex appeal there and then my deep
sleepers<00:05:23.590> Martellus<00:05:24.130> Bennett<00:05:24.160> he's<00:05:24.760> had<00:05:25.000> a

00:05:29.279 --> 00:05:29.289 
good games begin a year but lately he's

00:05:29.289 --> 00:05:30.839 
good games begin a year but lately he's

Dallas this week I like them I think he

00:05:38.500 --> 00:05:39.960 
Dallas this week I like them I think he
finds<00:05:38.770> your<00:05:39.010> lineup<00:05:39.370> unless<00:05:39.580> you<00:05:39.760> have<00:05:39.940> a

Tennessee's terrible against Iran that's

00:06:09.630 --> 00:06:11.719 
Tennessee's terrible against Iran that's
also<00:06:09.900> why<00:06:10.080> they're<00:06:10.320> so<00:06:10.470> bad<00:06:10.770> good<00:06:11.370> against<00:06:11.610> the

also why they're so bad good against the

00:06:11.729 --> 00:06:13.909 
also why they're so bad good against the
past<00:06:11.910> whatever<00:06:12.240> runs<00:06:12.509> you<00:06:13.050> got<00:06:13.320> to<00:06:13.500> start<00:06:13.740> in

past whatever runs you got to start in

00:06:13.919 --> 00:06:18.260 
past whatever runs you got to start in
but<00:06:14.130> it<00:06:14.970> scared<00:06:15.360> ma<00:06:16.080> hastily<00:06:16.919> /<00:06:17.310> is<00:06:17.550> gonna<00:06:18.090> be

00:06:18.260 --> 00:06:18.270 
but it scared ma hastily / is gonna be

00:06:18.270 --> 00:06:20.719 
but it scared ma hastily / is gonna be
the<00:06:18.419> Oakland<00:06:19.020> Raiders<00:06:19.259> defense<00:06:19.580> against<00:06:20.580> the

00:06:20.719 --> 00:06:20.729 
the Oakland Raiders defense against the

00:06:20.729 --> 00:06:22.670 
the Oakland Raiders defense against the
jets<00:06:21.030> and<00:06:21.479> her<00:06:21.570> little<00:06:21.840> Smith<00:06:22.080> is<00:06:22.259> starting

00:06:22.670 --> 00:06:22.680 
jets and her little Smith is starting

00:06:22.680 --> 00:06:25.159 
jets and her little Smith is starting
again<00:06:22.770> I<00:06:23.160> guess<00:06:23.729> the<00:06:24.030> Jets<00:06:24.389> have<00:06:24.570> given<00:06:24.840> up<00:06:24.960> the

00:06:25.159 --> 00:06:25.169 
again I guess the Jets have given up the

00:06:25.169 --> 00:06:27.920 
again I guess the Jets have given up the
most<00:06:25.410> fantasy<00:06:25.919> points<00:06:25.949> to<00:06:26.400> fancy<00:06:27.330> defenses

00:06:27.920 --> 00:06:27.930 
most fantasy points to fancy defenses

00:06:27.930 --> 00:06:30.499 
most fantasy points to fancy defenses
this<00:06:28.560> year<00:06:28.830> so<00:06:29.130> the<00:06:29.250> Oakland<00:06:29.610> is<00:06:29.850> playing<00:06:30.270> them

00:06:30.499 --> 00:06:30.509 
this year so the Oakland is playing them

00:06:30.509 --> 00:06:32.510 
this year so the Oakland is playing them
obviously<00:06:31.380> that<00:06:31.800> reason<00:06:32.070> I<00:06:32.100> like<00:06:32.280> him<00:06:32.430> I

00:06:32.510 --> 00:06:32.520 
obviously that reason I like him I

00:06:32.520 --> 00:06:34.580 
obviously that reason I like him I
actually<00:06:32.550> have<00:06:32.820> open<00:06:33.210> right<00:06:33.449> just<00:06:34.139> inside<00:06:34.380> my

00:06:34.580 --> 00:06:34.590 
actually have open right just inside my

00:06:34.590 --> 00:06:36.529 
actually have open right just inside my
top<00:06:34.800> five<00:06:35.009> for<00:06:35.190> this<00:06:35.310> week<00:06:35.520> and<00:06:35.759> then<00:06:36.150> my<00:06:36.300> deep

00:06:36.529 --> 00:06:36.539 
top five for this week and then my deep

00:06:36.539 --> 00:06:37.850 
top five for this week and then my deep
which<00:06:36.750> they<00:06:36.900> have<00:06:37.020> not<00:06:37.169> even<00:06:37.259> been<00:06:37.410> come<00:06:37.620> close
