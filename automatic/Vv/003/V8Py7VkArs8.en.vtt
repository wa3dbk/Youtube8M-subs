00:00:00.140 --> 00:00:03.800
 Servos in my previous video I showed how to 

00:00:04.390 --> 00:00:09.380
 Manuela with torches so a percent extension builds for signals so min 

00:00:09.379 --> 00:00:11.449
 if the new Peter 

00:00:11.449 --> 00:00:15.409
 over two Meet the Roman only the torches turn the signal over 

00:00:16.409 --> 00:00:19.769
 today engaged Map because I want to show today 

00:00:20.810 --> 00:00:23.130
 how to make it easier 

00:00:23.130 --> 00:00:26.130
 there is a finished her Peter Block 

00:00:26.880 --> 00:00:29.539
 I believe you about this 

00:00:29.539 --> 00:00:32.750
 and 2 El Sheikh stand 

00:00:32.750 --> 00:00:36.590
 You have to be the first normal stone does not have the stone you normally off 

00:00:36.590 --> 00:00:37.380
 Word 

00:00:37.380 --> 00:00:40.160
 and you get that by yourself 

00:00:40.160 --> 00:00:42.640
 those with coal 

00:00:42.640 --> 00:00:45.860
 yes I have been traced between with coal 

00:00:48.030 --> 00:00:51.030
 he seems to get a normal internet to get in 

00:00:53.680 --> 00:00:56.440
 Olpe but also animal two torches 

00:00:56.440 --> 00:00:58.530
 and Xstrata wants 

00:00:58.530 --> 00:01:01.530
 and the whole thing, Donth both look like her 

00:01:04.210 --> 00:01:07.330
 I've built it once before that's it he's going to be Peter 

00:01:09.170 --> 00:01:10.240
 the Zurich 

00:01:10.240 --> 00:01:13.410
 I bring in one 

00:01:13.410 --> 00:01:15.110
 and thus 

00:01:15.110 --> 00:01:18.110
 now over now 

00:01:21.150 --> 00:01:23.530
 so the signal is here 

00:01:23.530 --> 00:01:24.910
 it brings to an end 

00:01:24.910 --> 00:01:28.450
 So surely one must make known and their Peter is a block 

00:01:30.170 --> 00:01:33.170
 so may first difficulty the Moabites 

00:01:33.870 --> 00:01:37.830
 Kleinich door and put it back on because here is a copier on 

00:01:37.830 --> 00:01:41.420
 that is, the signal is only in one direction 

00:01:42.120 --> 00:01:45.610
 So if you want to build something that has flowed in the sea signal 

00:01:46.240 --> 00:01:49.040
 can give what is not useful in the piglet 

00:01:49.040 --> 00:01:51.210
 but then 

00:01:51.210 --> 00:01:54.250
 Funk does not see that 

00:01:54.250 --> 00:01:56.950
 so finally 

00:01:56.950 --> 00:01:59.950
 I do not have to sit here now 

00:02:00.480 --> 00:02:02.369
 szo and 

00:02:02.369 --> 00:02:05.800
 the signal is now passed on here 

00:02:05.800 --> 00:02:08.800
 over a block 

00:02:11.759 --> 00:02:15.079
 Franz new to dishes 2 

00:02:15.079 --> 00:02:18.079
 because they have been dropped I have three 

00:02:19.079 --> 00:02:22.859
 Dortmund and the 1 good too Wacken 

00:02:25.559 --> 00:02:28.559
 Roman situation so the way led despite cut 

00:02:33.969 --> 00:02:35.200
 so Ban 

00:02:35.200 --> 00:02:38.200
 he had a few nice features from Peter 

00:02:38.979 --> 00:02:42.429
 usually if I have a signal here 

00:02:42.429 --> 00:02:44.319
 there is 

00:02:44.319 --> 00:02:46.659
 it is instant 

00:02:46.659 --> 00:02:49.659
 Wulff will be passed on immediately 

00:02:50.959 --> 00:02:53.259
 with a 

00:02:53.259 --> 00:02:55.109
 in the millisecond area sign 

00:02:55.109 --> 00:02:57.559
 ca delay that is the facts but also 

00:02:57.559 --> 00:03:00.729
 I can now set a delay here 

00:03:00.729 --> 00:03:03.729
 here further out all the more 

00:03:04.519 --> 00:03:06.789
 slower so come see 

00:03:06.789 --> 00:03:09.939
 that takes a little bit of system tuning so you can do that 

00:03:11.309 --> 00:03:14.309
 if you switch several PCs of a nun also delaying 

00:03:15.799 --> 00:03:19.829
 Switching the Prost sound for a few seconds what happens 

00:03:22.829 --> 00:03:25.989
 an afterthought place are apart 

00:03:25.989 --> 00:03:27.629
 from the direction 

00:03:27.629 --> 00:03:30.019
 I need two torches each time 

00:03:30.019 --> 00:03:31.689
 and the steep 

00:03:31.689 --> 00:03:34.470
 and yet it is only 15 

00:03:34.470 --> 00:03:36.679
 Alberich 

00:03:36.679 --> 00:03:40.019
 hence these two torches 

00:03:40.019 --> 00:03:43.019
 almost the debt 

00:03:45.779 --> 00:03:47.389
 so in the case 

00:03:47.389 --> 00:03:50.749
 I passed the signal more efficiently because I have two torches 

00:03:50.749 --> 00:03:52.090
 but then come 

00:03:52.090 --> 00:03:55.590
 Animals Gestures double length that means if I'm going to be very long 

00:03:56.389 --> 00:03:57.809
 you have to think 

00:03:57.809 --> 00:03:59.099
 and what not 

00:03:59.099 --> 00:04:01.199
 Wenger does it 

00:04:01.199 --> 00:04:04.199
 Every Trier was of course saying Oh scared 

00:04:07.219 --> 00:04:09.299
 so 

00:04:09.299 --> 00:04:12.299
 this is crazy Peter 

00:04:13.059 --> 00:04:15.919
 then go through a lot of fun 

00:04:15.919 --> 00:04:17.609
 when trying out or circuit
