270 centigrades which means that you

00:01:07.439 --> 00:01:10.700 
270 centigrades which means that you
will<00:01:07.799> be<00:01:08.729> changing<00:01:09.180> the<00:01:09.420> watts<00:01:09.900> we<00:01:10.350> wattage

00:01:10.700 --> 00:01:10.710 
will be changing the watts we wattage

00:01:10.710 --> 00:01:15.320 
will be changing the watts we wattage
from<00:01:10.920> 120<00:01:11.820> you<00:01:12.540> can<00:01:12.750> work<00:01:12.990> to<00:01:13.520> 2100<00:01:14.520> what's

00:01:27.020 --> 00:01:27.030 
actually change the wattage and the

00:01:27.030 --> 00:01:29.780 
actually change the wattage and the
temperatures<00:01:27.600> -<00:01:27.930> okay<00:01:28.680> now<00:01:29.340> whatever<00:01:29.640> one<00:01:29.759> of

00:01:29.780 --> 00:01:29.790

right it also you sure that's your like
pasta<00:02:22.340> I'm<00:02:23.120> actually<00:02:23.270> using<00:02:23.600> a<00:02:23.840> 20<00:02:24.290> amps<00:02:24.680> point

00:02:25.060 --> 00:02:25.070 
pasta I'm actually using a 20 amps point

00:02:25.070 --> 00:02:26.380 
pasta I'm actually using a 20 amps point
now<00:02:25.250> there<00:02:25.400> are<00:02:25.490> two<00:02:25.610> points<00:02:25.790> already

00:02:26.380 --> 00:02:26.390 
now there are two points already

00:02:26.390 --> 00:02:28.360 
now there are two points already
one<00:02:27.140> of<00:02:27.200> the<00:02:27.260> left<00:02:27.440> is<00:02:27.500> actually<00:02:27.650> standard<00:02:28.280> de

00:02:28.360 --> 00:02:28.370 
one of the left is actually standard de

00:02:28.370 --> 00:02:30.160 
one of the left is actually standard de
marmol<00:02:28.670> one<00:02:28.820> I'm<00:02:29.270> not<00:02:29.420> using<00:02:29.630> that<00:02:29.780> because

00:02:30.160 --> 00:02:30.170 
marmol one I'm not using that because

00:02:30.170 --> 00:02:33.190 
marmol one I'm not using that because
this<00:02:30.380> is<00:02:30.560> a<00:02:30.590> heavy-duty<00:02:30.920> RPS<00:02:31.520> and<00:02:31.820> you<00:02:32.570> need<00:02:32.900> a

00:02:33.190 --> 00:02:33.200 
this is a heavy-duty RPS and you need a

00:02:33.200 --> 00:02:36.310 
this is a heavy-duty RPS and you need a
20<00:02:33.500> amps<00:02:33.800> switch<00:02:34.720> like<00:02:35.720> I'm<00:02:35.840> actually<00:02:36.020> doing

00:02:36.310 --> 00:02:36.320 
20 amps switch like I'm actually doing

00:02:36.320 --> 00:02:42.850 
20 amps switch like I'm actually doing
now<00:02:36.620> right<00:02:38.680> so<00:02:39.970> people<00:02:40.970> let's<00:02:41.150> start<00:02:41.510> okay<00:02:42.350> so

00:02:46.840 --> 00:02:46.850 
first things first let me switch on the

00:02:46.850 --> 00:02:49.330 
first things first let me switch on the
20mm<00:02:47.390> switch<00:02:47.660> the<00:02:48.290> moment<00:02:48.590> actually<00:02:48.740> do<00:02:49.070> that

people I'm absolutely sure there's some
kind<00:05:08.530> of<00:05:09.120> thermostatic<00:05:10.120> action<00:05:10.590> that

00:05:11.580 --> 00:05:11.590 
kind of thermostatic action that

00:05:11.590 --> 00:05:14.640 
kind of thermostatic action that
switches<00:05:12.010> on<00:05:12.160> the<00:05:12.190> giving<00:05:12.580> enough<00:05:13.139> to<00:05:14.139> from

00:05:14.640 --> 00:05:14.650 
switches on the giving enough to from

00:05:14.650 --> 00:05:15.930 
switches on the giving enough to from
time<00:05:14.889> to<00:05:15.070> time<00:05:15.100> to<00:05:15.460> regulate<00:05:15.789> the<00:05:15.910> temperature

00:05:15.930 --> 00:05:15.940 
time to time to regulate the temperature

00:05:15.940 --> 00:05:18.690 
time to time to regulate the temperature
keep<00:05:16.600> that<00:05:16.810> back<00:05:17.020> keep<00:05:17.979> it<00:05:18.130> inside<00:05:18.340> the<00:05:18.520> range

00:05:18.690 --> 00:05:18.700 
keep that back keep it inside the range

00:05:18.700 --> 00:05:21.390 
keep that back keep it inside the range
so<00:05:19.270> that's<00:05:19.479> okay<00:05:19.840> because<00:05:20.380> still<00:05:20.800> here<00:05:21.070> you

00:05:21.390 --> 00:05:21.400 
so that's okay because still here you

00:05:21.400 --> 00:05:23.760 
so that's okay because still here you
know<00:05:21.430> are<00:05:21.880> already<00:05:22.210> switched<00:05:22.750> off<00:05:23.169> the
