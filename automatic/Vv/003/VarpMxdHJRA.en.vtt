00:00:09.160 --> 00:00:10.440
 Sometime 

00:00:10.760 --> 00:00:12.100
 in the time 

00:00:13.600 --> 00:00:16.300
 Have someone had a ring on the mountain and lost it. 

00:00:16.480 --> 00:00:18.480
 It is very fun for us then. 

00:00:23.340 --> 00:00:24.620
 Ivory ring 

00:00:24.620 --> 00:00:26.040
 and many other things 

00:00:26.040 --> 00:00:29.140
 has melted out of the glaciers in Oppland. 

00:00:30.480 --> 00:00:32.620
 The ice in a way becomes a time machine. 

00:00:33.020 --> 00:00:35.640
 Things travel in a way through time in perfect condition, 

00:00:36.720 --> 00:00:38.740
 until they melt out. 

00:00:38.740 --> 00:00:40.680
 and then it goes very fast. 

00:00:40.840 --> 00:00:43.720
 on some types of objects we must be there the same week. 

00:00:43.960 --> 00:00:46.420
 After the season last year, in 2014 

00:00:46.420 --> 00:00:48.420
 when there was a lot of ice melting, 

00:00:48.440 --> 00:00:52.980
 then we found just over 2000 items. 

00:01:05.100 --> 00:01:08.480
 We get a very kick when we find things by the glacier. 

00:01:08.480 --> 00:01:09.880
 It is tremendously exciting. 

00:01:10.060 --> 00:01:12.060
 We might have been there for a couple of days 

00:01:12.060 --> 00:01:13.640
 and found nothing special, 

00:01:13.920 --> 00:01:17.920
 Maybe we've been in the camp and then come back 

00:01:17.920 --> 00:01:20.440
 also there are suddenly bones from a horse there 

00:01:20.440 --> 00:01:22.460
 or we find textile residues. 

00:01:22.720 --> 00:01:24.820
 We found a whole robe in 2011. 

00:01:24.820 --> 00:01:26.200
 Obviously you get the kick of it. 

00:01:26.920 --> 00:01:29.640
 The items come from several different letter spots in Oppland, 

00:01:29.660 --> 00:01:32.140
 but especially many have appeared at Lendbreen 

00:01:32.220 --> 00:01:35.040
 where previously a traffic route went over the mountain. 

00:01:36.420 --> 00:01:39.880
 We believe the square was used by people from around 300 AD. 

00:01:39.880 --> 00:01:42.460
 until the end of the Middle Ages was over. 

00:01:42.680 --> 00:01:44.680
 There we have found a lot of things 

00:01:44.680 --> 00:01:46.800
 for people have thrown things, a bit like we do when we go on a walk. 

00:01:47.020 --> 00:01:49.920
 And when people have been walking there for over 1500 years 

00:01:49.920 --> 00:01:51.680
 and threw some items on each turn 

00:01:51.780 --> 00:01:55.240
 and taken 10 or 15 trips a year, so there will be a lot of discoveries. 

00:01:56.180 --> 00:01:58.580
 Really many things have emerged from Lendbreen 

00:01:58.580 --> 00:02:00.360
 and other glaciers in Oppland. 

00:02:00.780 --> 00:02:03.340
 Not all items have been thrown or forgotten. 

00:02:03.500 --> 00:02:06.020
 Some have also lost arrows while hunting for reindeer. 

00:02:06.300 --> 00:02:11.040
 Finding arrow shafts from prehistoric times is incredibly rare. 

00:02:12.900 --> 00:02:17.720
 In addition, the lashing ring has attached the tip 

00:02:17.720 --> 00:02:19.940
 on the front arrow shaft, it's still there 

00:02:21.840 --> 00:02:23.820
 and the arrow is whole. 

00:02:23.820 --> 00:02:26.520
 And in addition, we have kept the steering springs on the back. 

00:02:27.020 --> 00:02:31.640
 So it suggests that it has been well and protected. 

00:02:32.840 --> 00:02:36.040
 The arrowheads say a lot about the age. 

00:02:36.040 --> 00:02:37.660
 Design of them. 

00:02:38.680 --> 00:02:41.240
 First, they are iron. 

00:02:42.720 --> 00:02:47.980
 Also, it's how they are partying to the actual arrow shaft. 

00:02:48.640 --> 00:02:55.740
 It says that they are from between 300 and 600 years e. 

00:02:57.480 --> 00:02:59.180
 Here is a complete ski 

00:02:59.180 --> 00:03:05.060
 which was found in the fall of 2014 in Reinheimen. 

00:03:05.720 --> 00:03:08.340
 It's an incredibly rare find. 

00:03:08.480 --> 00:03:12.300
 There are quite a few skis that have been found throughout Scandinavia 

00:03:12.500 --> 00:03:14.500
 from prehistoric times, 

00:03:15.040 --> 00:03:17.940
 but that the binding itself is intact, 

00:03:17.940 --> 00:03:21.100
 It is something you rarely see. 

00:03:21.420 --> 00:03:27.820
 This one is from about 700 years AD. 

00:03:30.320 --> 00:03:32.760
 It is clear that it is great to make the findings. 

00:03:33.140 --> 00:03:37.180
 It is quite demanding and collecting and doing fieldwork. 

00:03:38.220 --> 00:03:43.760
 But the backdrop for the findings is serious and gloomy. 

00:03:44.300 --> 00:03:48.300
 It is a very clear link to global warming and climate change. 

00:03:48.560 --> 00:03:51.760
 The ice melts and it goes relatively fast 

00:03:52.060 --> 00:03:57.120
 It looks like the ice in the Norwegian high mountain will be gone 

00:03:57.120 --> 00:03:59.540
 mostly during this century. 

00:03:59.540 --> 00:04:01.340
 It looks like it's going that way now.
