with the device the overall operation

00:04:54.830 --> 00:04:57.820 
with the device the overall operation
and<00:04:55.700> also<00:04:55.970> usability<00:04:56.630> of<00:04:56.660> it<00:04:56.960> we<00:04:57.470> felt<00:04:57.680> as

00:04:57.820 --> 00:04:57.830 
and also usability of it we felt as

00:04:57.830 --> 00:04:59.680 
and also usability of it we felt as
though<00:04:58.010> if<00:04:58.310> LG<00:04:58.640> invest<00:04:59.060> a<00:04:59.180> little<00:04:59.300> bit<00:04:59.510> more

00:04:59.680 --> 00:04:59.690 
though if LG invest a little bit more

00:04:59.690 --> 00:05:01.870 
though if LG invest a little bit more
time<00:04:59.960> into<00:05:00.380> the<00:05:00.560> development<00:05:01.130> process<00:05:01.370> both

00:05:01.870 --> 00:05:01.880 
time into the development process both

00:05:01.880 --> 00:05:03.940 
time into the development process both
from<00:05:02.120> hardware<00:05:02.690> and<00:05:02.870> also<00:05:03.440> software

00:05:03.940 --> 00:05:03.950 
from hardware and also software

00:05:03.950 --> 00:05:05.680 
from hardware and also software
standpoint<00:05:04.520> this<00:05:04.970> could<00:05:05.180> have<00:05:05.270> been<00:05:05.330> a<00:05:05.420> little

00:05:05.680 --> 00:05:05.690 
standpoint this could have been a little

00:05:05.690 --> 00:05:08.620 
standpoint this could have been a little
bit<00:05:05.870> better<00:05:06.170> device<00:05:06.650> overall<00:05:07.180> for<00:05:08.180> example

00:05:08.620 --> 00:05:08.630 
bit better device overall for example

00:05:08.630 --> 00:05:10.600 
bit better device overall for example
the<00:05:08.930> biggest<00:05:09.140> thing<00:05:09.560> that<00:05:09.920> we<00:05:10.100> saw<00:05:10.250> is<00:05:10.400> just

00:05:10.600 --> 00:05:10.610 
the biggest thing that we saw is just

00:05:10.610 --> 00:05:13.600 
the biggest thing that we saw is just
how<00:05:10.760> slow<00:05:11.150> the<00:05:11.480> phone<00:05:11.900> operates<00:05:12.110> at<00:05:12.560> times<00:05:12.800> for

00:05:13.600 --> 00:05:13.610 
how slow the phone operates at times for

00:05:13.610 --> 00:05:15.670 
how slow the phone operates at times for
example<00:05:14.000> when<00:05:14.150> you<00:05:14.240> rotate<00:05:14.570> the<00:05:14.870> device<00:05:15.200> it

00:05:15.670 --> 00:05:15.680 
example when you rotate the device it

00:05:15.680 --> 00:05:18.940 
example when you rotate the device it
should<00:05:16.460> automatically<00:05:17.090> reset<00:05:17.900> I've<00:05:18.080> change

00:05:18.940 --> 00:05:18.950 
should automatically reset I've change

00:05:18.950 --> 00:05:21.160 
should automatically reset I've change
it<00:05:19.070> to<00:05:19.190> our<00:05:19.310> landscape<00:05:19.910> view<00:05:20.240> but<00:05:20.840> as<00:05:20.960> you<00:05:21.080> can

00:05:21.160 --> 00:05:21.170 
it to our landscape view but as you can

00:05:21.170 --> 00:05:23.230 
it to our landscape view but as you can
