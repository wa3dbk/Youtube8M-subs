00:01:40.680 --> 00:01:43.039 
weaker defense is only 17 points against
Arizona<00:01:41.070> they<00:01:41.460> only<00:01:41.610> put<00:01:41.850> up<00:01:41.880> 14<00:01:42.420> against<00:01:42.750> USC

00:01:43.039 --> 00:01:43.049 
Arizona they only put up 14 against USC

00:01:43.049 --> 00:01:44.899 
Arizona they only put up 14 against USC
I<00:01:43.409> think<00:01:43.950> this<00:01:44.040> game<00:01:44.189> is<00:01:44.250> really<00:01:44.520> going<00:01:44.729> to<00:01:44.790> be

00:01:44.899 --> 00:01:44.909 
I think this game is really going to be

00:01:44.909 --> 00:01:47.630 
I think this game is really going to be
a<00:01:44.939> plate<00:01:45.689> conservatively<00:01:46.320> here<00:01:46.680> a<00:01:46.950> very

00:01:47.630 --> 00:01:47.640 
a plate conservatively here a very

00:01:47.640 --> 00:01:49.340 
a plate conservatively here a very
defensive-oriented<00:01:48.450> game<00:01:48.509> and<00:01:49.020> i<00:01:49.079> going<00:01:49.170> to<00:01:49.259> i

00:01:49.340 --> 00:01:49.350 
defensive-oriented game and i going to i

00:01:49.350 --> 00:01:51.620 
defensive-oriented game and i going to i
think<00:01:49.439> the<00:01:49.649> number<00:01:49.920> is<00:01:49.950> still<00:01:50.159> 23<00:01:51.149> points<00:01:51.509> off

00:01:51.620 --> 00:01:51.630 
think the number is still 23 points off

00:01:51.630 --> 00:01:53.690 
think the number is still 23 points off
were<00:01:51.659> thought<00:01:52.049> it<00:01:52.140> should<00:01:52.320> be<00:01:52.470> you<00:01:53.040> know<00:01:53.130> and

00:01:53.690 --> 00:01:53.700 
were thought it should be you know and

00:01:53.700 --> 00:01:55.520 
were thought it should be you know and
select<00:01:54.119> a<00:01:54.270> memory<00:01:54.570> here<00:01:54.750> i<00:01:54.780> think<00:01:54.869> back<00:01:55.320> to

00:01:55.520 --> 00:01:55.530 
select a memory here i think back to

00:01:57.170 --> 00:01:57.180 
what was boise do in their bowl games

00:01:57.180 --> 00:01:58.340 
what was boise do in their bowl games

00:02:03.980 --> 00:02:03.990 
it's just completely no one would ever

00:02:03.990 --> 00:02:06.139 
it's just completely no one would ever
know<00:02:04.140> no<00:02:04.380> one<00:02:04.560> can<00:02:04.740> do<00:02:04.890> anything<00:02:04.920> i'ma<00:02:05.460> tear<00:02:05.670> 16

and then yeah they played two years in a

00:02:07.619 --> 00:02:09.380 
and then yeah they played two years in a
row<00:02:07.680> why<00:02:08.039> they<00:02:08.190> got<00:02:08.310> a<00:02:08.340> fake<00:02:08.550> punts<00:02:09.030> and<00:02:09.149> things

00:02:09.380 --> 00:02:09.390

carries<00:02:55.620> over<00:02:55.740> i<00:02:55.830> think<00:02:56.190> more<00:02:56.310> to<00:02:56.400> the<00:02:56.490> defense

00:02:56.840 --> 00:02:56.850 
carries over i think more to the defense

00:02:56.850 --> 00:02:59.000 
carries over i think more to the defense
than<00:02:57.030> the<00:02:57.090> offense<00:02:57.480> well<00:02:58.050> even<00:02:58.230> you<00:02:58.680> go<00:02:58.830> back

00:02:59.000 --> 00:02:59.010 
than the offense well even you go back

00:02:59.010 --> 00:03:00.620 
than the offense well even you go back
to<00:02:59.040> the<00:02:59.160> very<00:02:59.610> first<00:02:59.730> game<00:03:00.150> of<00:03:00.330> the<00:03:00.420> season

defenses<00:03:49.890> i<00:03:49.980> think<00:03:50.190> that<00:03:50.310> they're<00:03:50.430> going<00:03:50.519> to

00:03:50.600 --> 00:03:50.610 
defenses i think that they're going to

00:03:50.610 --> 00:03:52.160 
defenses i think that they're going to
see<00:03:50.700> here<00:03:50.940> with<00:03:51.390> Washington<00:03:51.900> I<00:03:51.930> mean<00:03:52.080> they

00:03:52.160 --> 00:03:52.170 
see here with Washington I mean they

00:03:52.170 --> 00:03:54.170 
see here with Washington I mean they
they<00:03:52.380> only<00:03:52.650> got<00:03:53.010> twenty<00:03:53.549> seven<00:03:53.850> against<00:03:54.060> a

00:03:54.170 --> 00:03:54.180 
they only got twenty seven against a

00:03:54.180 --> 00:03:55.759 
they only got twenty seven against a
very<00:03:54.360> weak<00:03:54.570> Nevada<00:03:54.870> I<00:03:54.989> was<00:03:55.230> just<00:03:55.530> going<00:03:55.709> to

00:03:55.759 --> 00:03:55.769 
very weak Nevada I was just going to

00:03:55.769 --> 00:03:57.800 
very weak Nevada I was just going to
mention<00:03:55.830> that<00:03:56.160> and<00:03:56.670> I<00:03:56.910> didn't<00:03:57.390> go<00:03:57.540> to<00:03:57.570> that

00:03:57.800 --> 00:03:57.810 
mention that and I didn't go to that

00:03:57.810 --> 00:03:59.600 
mention that and I didn't go to that
game<00:03:58.080> i<00:03:58.110> probably<00:03:58.530> should<00:03:58.890> have<00:03:58.980> but<00:03:59.040> but<00:03:59.580> i

00:03:59.600 --> 00:03:59.610 
game i probably should have but but i

00:03:59.610 --> 00:04:01.580 
game i probably should have but but i
did<00:03:59.820> watch<00:04:00.000> the<00:04:00.209> game<00:04:00.390> and<00:04:00.690> thought<00:04:01.410> that<00:04:01.530> they

00:04:01.580 --> 00:04:01.590 
did watch the game and thought that they

00:04:01.590 --> 00:04:04.520 
did watch the game and thought that they
were<00:04:02.390> not<00:04:03.390> that<00:04:03.510> they<00:04:03.630> were<00:04:03.750> ineffective<00:04:04.200> but

00:04:04.520 --> 00:04:04.530 
were not that they were ineffective but

00:04:04.530 --> 00:04:05.810 
were not that they were ineffective but
you<00:04:04.620> could<00:04:04.769> just<00:04:04.860> see<00:04:05.010> they<00:04:05.160> just<00:04:05.370> don't<00:04:05.580> have

00:04:05.810 --> 00:04:05.820 
you could just see they just don't have

00:04:05.820 --> 00:04:07.850 
you could just see they just don't have
the<00:04:06.000> offensive<00:04:06.390> talent<00:04:06.780> that<00:04:07.380> we're<00:04:07.530> used<00:04:07.769> to

00:04:07.850 --> 00:04:07.860 
the offensive talent that we're used to

00:04:07.860 --> 00:04:09.740 
the offensive talent that we're used to
seeing<00:04:08.070> out<00:04:08.340> of<00:04:08.700> this<00:04:08.760> boise<00:04:09.150> team<00:04:09.330> in<00:04:09.480> nevada

00:04:09.740 --> 00:04:09.750 
seeing out of this boise team in nevada

00:04:09.750 --> 00:04:12.979 
seeing out of this boise team in nevada
a<00:04:09.900> horrible<00:04:10.530> defense<00:04:10.920> within<00:04:11.720> 2721<00:04:12.720> i<00:04:12.750> think

00:04:12.979 --> 00:04:12.989 
a horrible defense within 2721 i think

00:04:12.989 --> 00:04:15.320 
a horrible defense within 2721 i think
was<00:04:13.080> at<00:04:13.230> final<00:04:13.680> 2721<00:04:14.580> and<00:04:14.820> i<00:04:14.910> think<00:04:15.090> a<00:04:15.150> lot<00:04:15.180> of

00:04:15.320 --> 00:04:15.330 
was at final 2721 and i think a lot of

00:04:15.330 --> 00:04:16.490 
was at final 2721 and i think a lot of
people<00:04:15.420> are<00:04:15.690> seeing<00:04:15.930> it<00:04:16.109> the<00:04:16.229> way<00:04:16.320> we're
