00:00:06.589 --> 00:00:11.130
 wolves are just runners in the moment 

00:00:10.500 --> 00:00:13.410
 trot 

00:00:11.130 --> 00:00:15.330
 something like this is the continuous run 

00:00:13.410 --> 00:00:18.539
 at the wolf the trapp you can per day 

00:00:15.330 --> 00:00:20.600
 without problems 50 60 70 80 kilometers 

00:00:18.539 --> 00:00:23.220
 return 

00:00:20.600 --> 00:00:24.420
 For 100 years he was in Germany 

00:00:23.220 --> 00:00:26.550
 as extinct 

00:00:24.420 --> 00:00:28.529
 since the elimination of the inner German 

00:00:26.550 --> 00:00:31.289
 the European gray wolf wanders border 

00:00:28.529 --> 00:00:33.380
 westward a hunting ban throughout Europe 

00:00:31.289 --> 00:00:36.540
 puts them under nature conservation 

00:00:33.380 --> 00:00:38.989
 hunters like Frank Fass sift the canis 

00:00:36.540 --> 00:00:42.239
 lupus since 2000 more and more often 

00:00:38.989 --> 00:00:45.930
 he has 2009 together with wife christina 

00:00:42.239 --> 00:00:47.879
 The wolfcenter opens more than 35,000 

00:00:45.930 --> 00:00:48.960
 Visitors come to the zoo every year 

00:00:47.879 --> 00:00:50.910
 to north germany 

00:00:48.960 --> 00:00:55.020
 People should be the returnees 

00:00:50.910 --> 00:00:57.420
 learn to accept but still shape 

00:00:55.020 --> 00:00:58.230
 fairy tales and myths the image of evil 

00:00:57.420 --> 00:01:01.829
 wolf 

00:00:58.230 --> 00:01:02.760
 visitors often wonder howling wolves 

00:01:01.829 --> 00:01:06.180
 full moon on 

00:01:02.760 --> 00:01:09.030
 then we say that's what you do 

00:01:06.180 --> 00:01:15.390
 howl at full moon they howl as well 

00:01:09.030 --> 00:01:17.430
 at all other resting phases a wolf 

00:01:15.390 --> 00:01:18.479
 Meeting in the forest is extreme 

00:01:17.430 --> 00:01:21.600
 unlikely 

00:01:18.479 --> 00:01:23.939
 In most cases, the wolf will be us 

00:01:21.600 --> 00:01:26.490
 People already noticed in advance 

00:01:23.939 --> 00:01:28.080
 have and will be in most cases 

00:01:26.490 --> 00:01:30.329
 We do not even notice that he is there 

00:01:28.080 --> 00:01:32.189
 But should the situation arise 

00:01:30.329 --> 00:01:34.560
 that, for example, the cloud is ours 

00:01:32.189 --> 00:01:36.060
 nourishes and we have the impression he has 

00:01:34.560 --> 00:01:38.310
 I have not noticed so far 

00:01:36.060 --> 00:01:40.650
 then it is recommended, for example, in 

00:01:38.310 --> 00:01:42.720
 to clap hands or wolf 

00:01:40.650 --> 00:01:47.729
 to call something over so hello or 

00:01:42.720 --> 00:01:50.340
 Attention to the 250 animals already live in 

00:01:47.729 --> 00:01:52.770
 german forests 25 pack of wolves 

00:01:50.340 --> 00:01:55.259
 a total of a pack consists of the 

00:01:52.770 --> 00:01:57.659
 parents and their own offspring 

00:01:55.259 --> 00:02:00.810
 the young animals start after one to two 

00:01:57.659 --> 00:02:02.850
 years own rudel neither roads nor 

00:02:00.810 --> 00:02:04.640
 cities or can see the hike 

00:02:02.850 --> 00:02:07.049
 stop the wolves 

00:02:04.640 --> 00:02:09.119
 So far, they have been reinforced in 

00:02:07.049 --> 00:02:13.110
 East Germany settle and spread 

00:02:09.119 --> 00:02:15.270
 further northwest from the 

00:02:13.110 --> 00:02:19.080
 genetic ancestor of our dogs is 

00:02:15.270 --> 00:02:22.260
 the wolf expert is excited about this 

00:02:19.080 --> 00:02:27.120
 our reputable that is the the 

00:02:22.260 --> 00:02:29.819
 most searched by the 

00:02:27.120 --> 00:02:31.260
 Of course, hand rearing is one 

00:02:29.819 --> 00:02:33.959
 socialization of the people 

00:02:31.260 --> 00:02:35.760
 So we came into existence and therefore think 

00:02:33.959 --> 00:02:39.540
 never animals like that basically belong to 

00:02:35.760 --> 00:02:42.480
 eating free- living wolves 

00:02:39.540 --> 00:02:44.459
 wild boar deer and deer with them 

00:02:42.480 --> 00:02:47.190
 find enough people is their revier 

00:02:44.459 --> 00:02:48.629
 the 300 square kilometers in about 

00:02:47.190 --> 00:02:51.230
 the area of ​​a big city like frankfurt 

00:02:48.629 --> 00:02:51.230
 on the Main river 

00:02:51.340 --> 00:02:57.710
 The large carnivores were once with 

00:02:54.380 --> 00:02:59.690
 Fall poison and bait only in hunted 

00:02:57.710 --> 00:03:01.940
 sparsely populated areas like at the 

00:02:59.690 --> 00:03:03.400
 polish belarusian border could 

00:03:01.940 --> 00:03:06.610
 they really survive 

00:03:03.400 --> 00:03:10.940
 shepherds today rely on electric fencing 

00:03:06.610 --> 00:03:12.650
 that is elaborate but effective and 

00:03:10.940 --> 00:03:15.830
 also dogs guarding the herds 

00:03:12.650 --> 00:03:17.360
 will be used guard dogs 

00:03:15.830 --> 00:03:19.490
 are a very reliable medium 

00:03:17.360 --> 00:03:22.010
 but it is important to know 

00:03:19.490 --> 00:03:23.720
 that one herding dog alone is common 

00:03:22.010 --> 00:03:25.310
 can not do much it recommends 

00:03:23.720 --> 00:03:27.230
 always at least two if I am 

00:03:25.310 --> 00:03:31.880
 even to have three herd protection dogs 

00:03:27.230 --> 00:03:34.670
 in horse groups of say 8 

00:03:31.880 --> 00:03:36.770
 104 900 or even more than 1000 animals 

00:03:34.670 --> 00:03:38.780
 You will certainly be three four maybe 

00:03:36.770 --> 00:03:39.200
 even five will use protection dogs 

00:03:38.780 --> 00:03:41.180
 have to 

00:03:39.200 --> 00:03:44.060
 because wolves are also clever enough 

00:03:41.180 --> 00:03:45.470
 distract a single dog so that 

00:03:44.060 --> 00:03:47.690
 other wolves then back to the 

00:03:45.470 --> 00:03:51.520
 That's why it's important 

00:03:47.690 --> 00:03:54.170
 that we use several such dogs 

00:03:51.520 --> 00:03:56.750
 if the wolf strikes it should be one 

00:03:54.170 --> 00:03:58.040
 many give financial compensation 

00:03:56.750 --> 00:04:01.180
 shepherds feel relaxed 

00:03:58.040 --> 00:04:03.560
 complain about high bureaucratic hurdles 

00:04:01.180 --> 00:04:05.840
 regardless, wolves will 

00:04:03.560 --> 00:04:08.290
 continue to expand their existence but is 

00:04:05.840 --> 00:04:11.840
 not yet saved 

00:04:08.290 --> 00:04:14.420
 There must be 1000 adult wolves 

00:04:11.840 --> 00:04:16.549
 ultimately all of them 

00:04:14.420 --> 00:04:20.419
 looking genetically at each other 

00:04:16.549 --> 00:04:23.169
 keep healthy and we are still of that 

00:04:20.419 --> 00:04:23.169
 some removed
