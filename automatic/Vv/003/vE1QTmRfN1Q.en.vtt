to<00:00:29.279> five<00:00:29.490> year<00:00:29.519> olds<00:00:29.939> is<00:00:30.619> significantly

00:00:31.609 --> 00:00:31.619 
to five year olds is significantly

00:00:31.619 --> 00:00:36.080 
to five year olds is significantly
different<00:00:31.890> why<00:00:32.660> because<00:00:33.660> in<00:00:34.050> swim<00:00:34.860> 101<00:00:35.370> we're

00:00:36.080 --> 00:00:36.090 
different why because in swim 101 we're

00:00:36.090 --> 00:00:38.090 
different why because in swim 101 we're
teaching<00:00:36.410> preschoolers<00:00:37.410> and<00:00:37.590> young<00:00:37.829> children

00:00:40.430 --> 00:00:40.440 
between the ages of three and five years

00:00:40.440 --> 00:00:44.229 
between the ages of three and five years
old<00:00:40.950> we<00:00:41.670> need<00:00:41.910> to<00:00:42.059> keep<00:00:42.300> their<00:00:42.629> course<00:00:43.050> more

00:00:44.229 --> 00:00:44.239 
old we need to keep their course more

00:00:44.239 --> 00:00:47.000 
old we need to keep their course more
activity<00:00:45.239> oriented<00:00:45.780> whereas<00:00:46.260> in<00:00:46.620> our<00:00:46.710> swim

00:00:47.000 --> 00:00:47.010 
activity oriented whereas in our swim

00:00:47.010 --> 00:00:50.450 
activity oriented whereas in our swim
102<00:00:47.399> or<00:00:47.640> 103<00:00:48.239> course<00:00:48.960> they're<00:00:49.710> older<00:00:50.190> children

00:00:50.450 --> 00:00:50.460 
102 or 103 course they're older children

00:00:50.460 --> 00:00:53.930 
102 or 103 course they're older children
so<00:00:51.180> we<00:00:51.420> go<00:00:51.600> with<00:00:51.840> a<00:00:52.050> more<00:00:52.410> drill<00:00:53.100> oriented

00:00:53.930 --> 00:00:53.940 
so we go with a more drill oriented

00:00:53.940 --> 00:00:56.689 
so we go with a more drill oriented
lesson<00:00:54.600> plan<00:00:54.840> and<00:00:55.110> do<00:00:55.649> the<00:00:55.770> differences<00:00:56.489> in

00:00:59.410 --> 00:00:59.420 
approach some of the skills we teach

00:00:59.420 --> 00:01:02.029 
approach some of the skills we teach
because<00:01:00.420> of<00:01:00.780> the<00:01:00.930> age<00:01:01.199> and<00:01:01.440> developmental

00:01:02.029 --> 00:01:02.039 
because of the age and developmental

00:01:02.039 --> 00:01:04.160 
because of the age and developmental
differences<00:01:02.250> are<00:01:02.910> also<00:01:03.420> different

00:01:04.160 --> 00:01:04.170 
differences are also different
