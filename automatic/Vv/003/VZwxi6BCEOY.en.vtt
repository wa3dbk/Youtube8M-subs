00:00:53.450 --> 00:00:53.460 
in the lathe and I measured it out just

00:00:53.460 --> 00:00:54.200 
in the lathe and I measured it out just
like<00:00:53.670> that

00:00:54.200 --> 00:00:54.210 
like that

00:00:54.210 --> 00:00:56.540

it fits super tight and then I kept

00:00:56.550 --> 00:00:59.299 
it fits super tight and then I kept
these<00:00:56.699> in<00:00:56.760> the<00:00:57.149> deep<00:00:57.300> freezer<00:00:57.980> well<00:00:58.980> they've

00:00:59.299 --> 00:00:59.309
