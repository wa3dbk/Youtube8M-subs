file here primarily for a roman tub so
you<00:00:30.800> can<00:00:30.919> actually<00:00:31.099> have<00:00:31.910> just<00:00:32.270> a<00:00:32.419> spout<00:00:32.750> on<00:00:32.780> a

00:00:33.010 --> 00:00:33.020 
you can actually have just a spout on a

00:00:33.020 --> 00:00:34.690 
you can actually have just a spout on a
roman<00:00:33.500> tub<00:00:33.710> and<00:00:33.950> have<00:00:34.070> this<00:00:34.220> mountain

00:00:34.690 --> 00:00:34.700 
roman tub and have this mountain

00:00:34.700 --> 00:00:37.240 
roman tub and have this mountain
anywhere<00:00:35.660> you<00:00:35.810> would<00:00:35.930> like<00:00:36.170> so<00:00:36.950> you<00:00:37.010> can

00:00:37.240 --> 00:00:37.250 
anywhere you would like so you can

00:00:37.250 --> 00:00:39.660 
anywhere you would like so you can
adjust<00:00:37.370> your<00:00:38.200> temperature<00:00:39.200> and<00:00:39.350> volume

00:00:39.660 --> 00:00:39.670 
adjust your temperature and volume

00:00:39.670 --> 00:00:42.070 
adjust your temperature and volume
alright<00:00:40.670> this<00:00:40.850> one<00:00:41.060> you<00:00:41.150> just<00:00:41.329> plug<00:00:41.540> in<00:00:41.750> it

00:00:42.070 --> 00:00:42.080 
alright this one you just plug in it

00:00:42.080 --> 00:00:44.830 
alright this one you just plug in it
takes<00:00:42.320> just<00:00:42.500> a<00:00:42.740> regular<00:00:43.340> wire<00:00:44.060> that<00:00:44.390> comes<00:00:44.570> out

00:00:44.830 --> 00:00:44.840 
takes just a regular wire that comes out

00:00:44.840 --> 00:00:47.050 
takes just a regular wire that comes out
of<00:00:44.960> the<00:00:45.050> wall<00:00:45.200> here<00:00:45.560> and<00:00:46.160> then<00:00:46.400> two<00:00:46.640> screws

00:00:47.050 --> 00:00:47.060 
of the wall here and then two screws

00:00:47.060 --> 00:00:49.750 
of the wall here and then two screws
mounted<00:00:47.570> to<00:00:47.750> your<00:00:47.780> tile<00:00:48.170> work<00:00:48.550> then<00:00:49.550> this

00:00:49.750 --> 00:00:49.760 
mounted to your tile work then this

00:00:49.760 --> 00:00:51.970 
mounted to your tile work then this
control<00:00:50.480> here<00:00:50.780> you<00:00:51.080> just<00:00:51.320> set<00:00:51.650> your

00:00:51.970 --> 00:00:51.980 
control here you just set your

00:00:51.980 --> 00:00:54.850 
control here you just set your
temperature<00:00:52.160> here<00:00:52.760> up<00:00:53.600> and<00:00:53.930> down<00:00:54.110> and<00:00:54.410> then

00:00:54.850 --> 00:00:54.860 
temperature here up and down and then

00:00:54.860 --> 00:00:56.980 
temperature here up and down and then
miss<00:00:55.100> control<00:00:55.940> here<00:00:56.180> would<00:00:56.330> set<00:00:56.540> your<00:00:56.690> flow

00:00:56.980 --> 00:00:56.990 
miss control here would set your flow

00:00:56.990 --> 00:00:59.560 
miss control here would set your flow
and<00:00:57.710> it<00:00:57.800> also<00:00:57.950> has<00:00:58.160> a<00:00:58.340> pause<00:00:58.670> button<00:00:59.000> if<00:00:59.390> you

00:00:59.560 --> 00:00:59.570 
and it also has a pause button if you

00:00:59.570 --> 00:01:01.150 
and it also has a pause button if you
ever<00:00:59.690> need<00:00:59.930> it<00:01:00.080> to<00:01:00.200> pause<00:01:00.410> the<00:01:00.650> water<00:01:00.860> play

00:01:01.150 --> 00:01:01.160 
ever need it to pause the water play

00:01:01.160 --> 00:01:04.170 
ever need it to pause the water play
just<00:01:01.430> push<00:01:01.640> that<00:01:01.880> and<00:01:02.180> then<00:01:02.930> this<00:01:03.380> would<00:01:03.740> be

00:01:04.170 --> 00:01:04.180 
just push that and then this would be

00:01:04.180 --> 00:01:06.670 
just push that and then this would be
depending<00:01:05.180> on<00:01:05.299> the<00:01:05.479> youth<00:01:05.720> amount<00:01:06.170> of<00:01:06.290> users

00:01:06.670 --> 00:01:06.680 
depending on the youth amount of users

00:01:06.680 --> 00:01:08.760 
depending on the youth amount of users
you<00:01:07.310> can<00:01:07.369> have<00:01:07.580> different<00:01:08.119> settings<00:01:08.570> in<00:01:08.689> here

00:01:08.760 --> 00:01:08.770 
you can have different settings in here

00:01:08.770 --> 00:01:11.850 
you can have different settings in here
you<00:01:09.770> like<00:01:09.979> your<00:01:10.189> temperature<00:01:10.729> at<00:01:10.880> a<00:01:10.939> certain

00:01:11.850 --> 00:01:11.860 
you like your temperature at a certain

00:01:11.860 --> 00:01:14.529 
you like your temperature at a certain
certain<00:01:12.860> temperature<00:01:13.310> and<00:01:13.640> your<00:01:13.759> flow<00:01:13.999> set<00:01:14.509> a

00:01:14.529 --> 00:01:14.539 
certain temperature and your flow set a

00:01:14.539 --> 00:01:17.440 
certain temperature and your flow set a
certain<00:01:14.929> way<00:01:15.109> you<00:01:15.170> can<00:01:15.560> program<00:01:16.130> that<00:01:16.579> in<00:01:16.789> and

00:01:17.440 --> 00:01:17.450 
certain way you can program that in and

00:01:17.450 --> 00:01:19.209 
certain way you can program that in and
then<00:01:17.479> push<00:01:17.869> one<00:01:18.200> and<00:01:18.469> then<00:01:18.619> that's<00:01:18.829> what<00:01:19.070> it

00:01:19.209 --> 00:01:19.219 
then push one and then that's what it

00:01:19.219 --> 00:01:20.529 
then push one and then that's what it
would<00:01:19.369> come<00:01:19.579> to<00:01:19.789> and<00:01:20.030> if<00:01:20.149> you<00:01:20.299> wanted

00:01:20.529 --> 00:01:20.539 
would come to and if you wanted

00:01:20.539 --> 00:01:22.510 
would come to and if you wanted
something<00:01:20.899> different<00:01:21.079> or<00:01:22.039> a<00:01:22.100> different

00:01:22.510 --> 00:01:22.520 
something different or a different

00:01:22.520 --> 00:01:24.399 
something different or a different
person<00:01:22.880> wanted<00:01:23.149> a<00:01:23.270> different<00:01:23.450> flow<00:01:24.079> and

00:01:24.399 --> 00:01:24.409 
person wanted a different flow and

00:01:24.409 --> 00:01:26.499 
person wanted a different flow and
temperature<00:01:24.560> number<00:01:25.399> two<00:01:25.609> could<00:01:25.819> be<00:01:25.969> set<00:01:26.240> for

00:01:26.499 --> 00:01:26.509 
temperature number two could be set for

00:01:26.509 --> 00:01:28.270 
temperature number two could be set for
that<00:01:26.719> well<00:01:27.439> let's<00:01:27.710> give<00:01:27.859> it<00:01:27.950> its<00:01:28.069> maiden

00:01:28.270 --> 00:01:28.280 
that well let's give it its maiden

00:01:28.280 --> 00:01:29.950 
that well let's give it its maiden
voyage<00:01:28.399> it's<00:01:28.880> never<00:01:29.060> been<00:01:29.210> turned<00:01:29.479> on<00:01:29.630> so

00:01:29.950 --> 00:01:29.960 
voyage it's never been turned on so

00:01:29.960 --> 00:01:38.360 
voyage it's never been turned on so
let's<00:01:30.049> see<00:01:30.229> how<00:01:30.259> it<00:01:30.350> works

00:01:38.360 --> 00:01:38.370 

00:01:38.370 --> 00:01:49.170 

we'll<00:01:38.760> stop<00:01:39.000> the<00:01:39.150> flow

00:01:49.170 --> 00:01:49.180 

00:01:49.180 --> 00:01:57.490 

get<00:01:49.690> the<00:01:49.780> partnership

00:01:57.490 --> 00:01:57.500 

00:01:57.500 --> 00:02:00.710 

there's<00:01:58.500> the<00:01:58.740> pause<00:01:58.950> button<00:01:59.420> and<00:02:00.420> he<00:02:00.540> could

00:02:00.710 --> 00:02:00.720 
there's the pause button and he could

00:02:00.720 --> 00:02:05.740 
there's the pause button and he could
tap<00:02:00.900> it<00:02:01.080> again<00:02:01.350> to<00:02:01.470> get<00:02:01.590> it<00:02:01.740> going<00:02:01.950> again

00:02:05.740 --> 00:02:05.750 

00:02:05.750 --> 00:02:08.950 

that<00:02:06.350> is<00:02:06.590> cool<00:02:06.830> and<00:02:07.340> then<00:02:07.850> the<00:02:08.210> red<00:02:08.420> light<00:02:08.660> show

00:02:08.950 --> 00:02:08.960 
that is cool and then the red light show

00:02:08.960 --> 00:02:11.140 
that is cool and then the red light show
you<00:02:09.110> where<00:02:09.289> your<00:02:09.440> compass<00:02:09.920> truth<00:02:10.250> so<00:02:11.030> the

00:02:11.140 --> 00:02:11.150 
you where your compass truth so the

00:02:11.150 --> 00:02:13.470 
you where your compass truth so the
higher<00:02:11.390> you<00:02:11.630> go<00:02:11.870> it<00:02:12.380> gets<00:02:12.620> red<00:02:12.890> all<00:02:13.130> the<00:02:13.160> way

00:02:13.470 --> 00:02:13.480 
higher you go it gets red all the way

00:02:13.480 --> 00:02:16.630 
higher you go it gets red all the way
which<00:02:14.480> that<00:02:14.660> would<00:02:14.810> be<00:02:14.930> completely<00:02:15.640> full

00:02:16.630 --> 00:02:16.640 
which that would be completely full

00:02:16.640 --> 00:02:19.090 
which that would be completely full
compass<00:02:17.120> through<00:02:17.300> there<00:02:17.620> and<00:02:18.620> you<00:02:18.740> can<00:02:18.890> set

00:02:19.090 --> 00:02:19.100 
compass through there and you can set

00:02:19.100 --> 00:02:21.040 
compass through there and you can set
the<00:02:19.250> maximum<00:02:19.670> temperature<00:02:20.030> in<00:02:20.510> the<00:02:20.630> control

00:02:21.040 --> 00:02:21.050 
the maximum temperature in the control

00:02:21.050 --> 00:02:24.340 
the maximum temperature in the control
panel<00:02:21.080> so<00:02:21.830> that<00:02:21.860> it<00:02:22.600> it<00:02:23.600> won't<00:02:23.810> go<00:02:24.020> over<00:02:24.050> a

00:02:24.340 --> 00:02:24.350 
panel so that it it won't go over a

00:02:24.350 --> 00:02:27.520 
panel so that it it won't go over a
certain<00:02:24.620> temperature<00:02:25.430> for<00:02:25.820> scalding<00:02:26.420> I<00:02:26.690> think

00:02:27.520 --> 00:02:27.530 
certain temperature for scalding I think

00:02:27.530 --> 00:02:30.190 
certain temperature for scalding I think
you<00:02:27.590> need<00:02:27.709> a<00:02:27.770> set<00:02:28.100> like<00:02:28.250> around<00:02:28.610> 185<00:02:29.200> remote

00:02:30.190 --> 00:02:30.200 
you need a set like around 185 remote

00:02:30.200 --> 00:02:36.960 
you need a set like around 185 remote
code<00:02:31.300> and<00:02:32.300> then<00:02:32.540> set<00:02:32.780> your<00:02:32.810> flow<00:02:33.200> here

00:02:36.960 --> 00:02:36.970 

00:02:36.970 --> 00:02:40.380 

that's<00:02:37.660> full<00:02:37.960> flow<00:02:38.730> and<00:02:39.730> then<00:02:39.910> let's<00:02:40.150> take<00:02:40.360> a

00:02:40.380 --> 00:02:40.390 
that's full flow and then let's take a

00:02:40.390 --> 00:02:41.910 
that's full flow and then let's take a
look<00:02:40.600> behind<00:02:40.750> the<00:02:40.990> wall<00:02:41.200> and<00:02:41.410> see<00:02:41.590> what's<00:02:41.770> in

00:02:41.910 --> 00:02:41.920 
look behind the wall and see what's in

00:02:41.920 --> 00:02:45.540 
look behind the wall and see what's in
the<00:02:42.010> box<00:02:42.220> here<00:02:43.650> and<00:02:44.650> this<00:02:44.800> will<00:02:45.070> show<00:02:45.250> the

00:02:45.540 --> 00:02:45.550 
the box here and this will show the

00:02:45.550 --> 00:02:48.510 
the box here and this will show the
actual<00:02:46.410> digital<00:02:47.410> process<00:02:47.950> or<00:02:48.160> they<00:02:48.280> get<00:02:48.400> to

00:02:48.510 --> 00:02:48.520 
actual digital process or they get to

00:02:48.520 --> 00:02:51.570 
actual digital process or they get to
mounted<00:02:48.850> on<00:02:48.970> the<00:02:49.090> wall<00:02:49.920> they<00:02:50.920> make<00:02:51.100> it<00:02:51.220> a<00:02:51.310> very

00:02:51.570 --> 00:02:51.580 
mounted on the wall they make it a very

00:02:51.580 --> 00:02:54.300 
mounted on the wall they make it a very
simple<00:02:52.270> system<00:02:52.810> they<00:02:53.140> have<00:02:53.170> click<00:02:54.040> type

00:02:54.300 --> 00:02:54.310 
simple system they have click type

00:02:54.310 --> 00:02:57.030 
simple system they have click type
connectors<00:02:54.970> that<00:02:55.000> go<00:02:55.300> right<00:02:55.540> on<00:02:55.720> the<00:02:56.040> stubs

00:02:57.030 --> 00:02:57.040 
connectors that go right on the stubs

00:02:57.040 --> 00:02:59.970 
connectors that go right on the stubs
here<00:02:57.430> and<00:02:57.820> then<00:02:58.270> inside<00:02:58.750> you<00:02:59.530> can<00:02:59.680> set<00:02:59.860> your

00:02:59.970 --> 00:02:59.980 
here and then inside you can set your

00:02:59.980 --> 00:03:02.550 
here and then inside you can set your
temperature<00:03:00.160> to<00:03:00.790> a<00:03:00.820> maximum<00:03:01.390> temperature<00:03:02.110> so

00:03:02.550 --> 00:03:02.560 
temperature to a maximum temperature so

00:03:02.560 --> 00:03:04.020 
temperature to a maximum temperature so
there's<00:03:02.740> no<00:03:02.860> scalding<00:03:03.310> you<00:03:03.670> don't<00:03:03.820> have<00:03:03.910> to

00:03:04.020 --> 00:03:04.030 
there's no scalding you don't have to

00:03:04.030 --> 00:03:06.240 
there's no scalding you don't have to
worry<00:03:04.210> about<00:03:04.360> scalding<00:03:05.110> moans<00:03:05.620> really<00:03:05.920> at<00:03:06.130> the

00:03:06.240 --> 00:03:06.250 
worry about scalding moans really at the

00:03:06.250 --> 00:03:09.240 
worry about scalding moans really at the
forefront<00:03:06.280> of<00:03:06.880> technology<00:03:07.510> isn't<00:03:07.750> it<00:03:07.900> yeah<00:03:08.250> as

00:03:09.240 --> 00:03:09.250 
forefront of technology isn't it yeah as

00:03:09.250 --> 00:03:10.920 
forefront of technology isn't it yeah as
you<00:03:09.459> can<00:03:09.580> see<00:03:09.730> from<00:03:09.850> the<00:03:10.000> access<00:03:10.390> panel<00:03:10.750> here

00:03:10.920 --> 00:03:10.930 
you can see from the access panel here

00:03:10.930 --> 00:03:13.800 
you can see from the access panel here
here's<00:03:11.290> the<00:03:11.470> brains<00:03:11.770> to<00:03:12.190> the<00:03:12.220> digital<00:03:12.810> i/o

00:03:13.800 --> 00:03:13.810 
here's the brains to the digital i/o

00:03:13.810 --> 00:03:15.780 
here's the brains to the digital i/o
system<00:03:14.260> it's<00:03:14.590> called<00:03:14.770> the<00:03:14.860> digital<00:03:15.190> processor

00:03:15.780 --> 00:03:15.790 
system it's called the digital processor

00:03:15.790 --> 00:03:18.660 
system it's called the digital processor
all<00:03:15.940> made<00:03:16.150> by<00:03:16.180> Moen<00:03:16.720> all<00:03:17.140> tied<00:03:17.560> in<00:03:17.800> and<00:03:18.070> as

00:03:18.660 --> 00:03:18.670 
all made by Moen all tied in and as

00:03:18.670 --> 00:03:21.780 
all made by Moen all tied in and as
James<00:03:18.940> said<00:03:19.240> much<00:03:19.690> less<00:03:20.350> plumbing<00:03:21.130> involved

00:03:21.780 --> 00:03:21.790 
James said much less plumbing involved

00:03:21.790 --> 00:03:24.510 
James said much less plumbing involved
because<00:03:22.180> here<00:03:22.570> we<00:03:22.720> only<00:03:22.870> have<00:03:23.080> one<00:03:23.520> copper

00:03:24.510 --> 00:03:24.520 
because here we only have one copper

00:03:24.520 --> 00:03:26.280 
because here we only have one copper
going<00:03:25.030> up<00:03:25.180> to<00:03:25.330> the<00:03:25.420> whole<00:03:25.570> system<00:03:25.810> that<00:03:26.140> runs

00:03:26.280 --> 00:03:26.290 
going up to the whole system that runs

00:03:26.290 --> 00:03:29.730 
going up to the whole system that runs
the<00:03:26.530> shower<00:03:26.770> so<00:03:27.370> it<00:03:28.060> is<00:03:28.330> state-of-the-art<00:03:29.080> and

00:03:29.730 --> 00:03:29.740 
the shower so it is state-of-the-art and

00:03:29.740 --> 00:03:32.640 
the shower so it is state-of-the-art and
it's<00:03:30.280> also<00:03:30.430> smart<00:03:31.150> as<00:03:31.420> far<00:03:31.630> as<00:03:31.840> plumbing<00:03:32.200> and

00:03:32.640 --> 00:03:32.650 
it's also smart as far as plumbing and

00:03:32.650 --> 00:03:36.630 
it's also smart as far as plumbing and
access<00:03:33.310> and<00:03:33.670> overall<00:03:34.480> operation<00:03:35.370> this<00:03:36.370> is<00:03:36.520> not

00:03:36.630 --> 00:03:36.640 
access and overall operation this is not

00:03:36.640 --> 00:03:38.940 
access and overall operation this is not
remote<00:03:37.000> control<00:03:37.480> that's<00:03:38.290> a<00:03:38.410> really<00:03:38.770> nice

00:03:38.940 --> 00:03:38.950 
remote control that's a really nice

00:03:38.950 --> 00:03:41.280 
remote control that's a really nice
feature<00:03:39.450> so<00:03:40.450> here<00:03:40.690> you<00:03:40.810> can<00:03:40.870> mount<00:03:41.140> this

00:03:41.280 --> 00:03:41.290 
feature so here you can mount this

00:03:41.290 --> 00:03:43.290 
feature so here you can mount this
anywhere<00:03:41.739> out<00:03:41.980> here<00:03:42.010> so<00:03:42.880> if<00:03:42.970> you're<00:03:43.150> in<00:03:43.209> the

00:03:43.290 --> 00:03:43.300 
anywhere out here so if you're in the
