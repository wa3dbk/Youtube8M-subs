some some thoughts certainly that

00:00:48.360 --> 00:00:50.150 
some some thoughts certainly that
they're<00:00:48.629> getting<00:00:48.750> very<00:00:49.079> close<00:00:49.320> to<00:00:49.469> ultimately

00:00:50.150 --> 00:00:50.160 
they're getting very close to ultimately

they're getting very close to ultimately
a<00:00:50.840> rescue<00:00:51.840> plan<00:00:52.140> for<00:00:52.559> Greece<00:00:52.829> certainly

00:00:53.810 --> 00:00:53.820 
a rescue plan for Greece certainly

00:00:53.820 --> 00:00:55.459 
a rescue plan for Greece certainly
austerity<00:00:54.449> measures<00:00:54.780> that<00:00:54.930> will<00:00:55.020> be<00:00:55.170> having

00:00:55.459 --> 00:00:55.469 
austerity measures that will be having

00:00:55.469 --> 00:00:57.260 
austerity measures that will be having
to<00:00:55.530> take<00:00:55.680> it<00:00:55.829> on<00:00:55.920> by<00:00:56.160> the<00:00:56.219> Greek<00:00:56.489> government<00:00:56.670> do

00:00:57.260 --> 00:00:57.270 
to take it on by the Greek government do

00:00:57.270 --> 00:01:02.720 
to take it on by the Greek government do
you<00:00:57.449> believe<00:00:57.780> it<00:00:57.960> will<00:00:58.109> ultimately<00:00:58.230> work<00:01:01.730> well

00:01:02.720 --> 00:01:02.730 
you believe it will ultimately work well

00:01:02.730 --> 00:01:05.109 
you believe it will ultimately work well
I<00:01:02.760> think<00:01:03.000> they<00:01:03.090> will<00:01:03.270> be<00:01:03.420> were<00:01:03.570> bailed<00:01:03.840> out<00:01:04.140> by

00:01:05.109 --> 00:01:05.119 
I think they will be were bailed out by

00:01:05.119 --> 00:01:08.990 
I think they will be were bailed out by
indirectly<00:01:06.290> the<00:01:07.290> ECB<00:01:08.070> that<00:01:08.490> will<00:01:08.700> guarantee

00:01:08.990 --> 00:01:09.000 
indirectly the ECB that will guarantee

00:01:09.000 --> 00:01:11.870 
indirectly the ECB that will guarantee
some<00:01:09.720> bonds<00:01:10.200> that<00:01:10.439> they<00:01:10.710> are<00:01:10.920> issuing<00:01:11.549> and

00:01:11.870 --> 00:01:11.880 
some bonds that they are issuing and

00:01:11.880 --> 00:01:13.730 
some bonds that they are issuing and
these<00:01:12.090> bombs<00:01:12.450> will<00:01:12.720> then<00:01:12.900> be<00:01:13.080> bought<00:01:13.320> by<00:01:13.680> the

00:01:13.730 --> 00:01:13.740 
these bombs will then be bought by the

00:01:13.740 --> 00:01:16.670 
these bombs will then be bought by the
public<00:01:14.280> or<00:01:14.490> by<00:01:14.670> financial<00:01:15.210> institutions<00:01:15.680> but

00:01:16.670 --> 00:01:16.680 
public or by financial institutions but

00:01:16.680 --> 00:01:18.830 
public or by financial institutions but
I<00:01:16.740> don't<00:01:17.130> think<00:01:17.340> it<00:01:17.460> will<00:01:17.670> work<00:01:17.700> out<00:01:18.210> and<00:01:18.659> I

00:01:18.830 --> 00:01:18.840 
I don't think it will work out and I

00:01:18.840 --> 00:01:21.130 
I don't think it will work out and I
think<00:01:19.110> other<00:01:19.320> countries<00:01:19.950> like<00:01:20.159> Spain<00:01:20.610> and

00:01:21.130 --> 00:01:21.140 
think other countries like Spain and

00:01:21.140 --> 00:01:25.370 
think other countries like Spain and
probably<00:01:23.150> Portugal<00:01:24.150> will<00:01:24.420> then<00:01:24.630> also<00:01:24.869> have<00:01:25.229> to

00:01:25.370 --> 00:01:25.380 
probably Portugal will then also have to

00:01:25.380 --> 00:01:27.950 
probably Portugal will then also have to
be<00:01:25.530> bailed<00:01:25.799> out<00:01:26.040> eventually<00:01:26.580> and<00:01:27.060> it<00:01:27.750> will

00:01:27.950 --> 00:01:27.960 
be bailed out eventually and it will

00:01:27.960 --> 00:01:30.620 
be bailed out eventually and it will
lead<00:01:28.200> to<00:01:28.439> more<00:01:28.710> monetization<00:01:29.579> in<00:01:29.939> Europe<00:01:30.299> one

00:01:30.620 --> 00:01:30.630 
lead to more monetization in Europe one

00:01:30.630 --> 00:01:33.160 
lead to more monetization in Europe one
of<00:01:30.810> the<00:01:30.960> reasons<00:01:31.140> the<00:01:31.710> euro<00:01:31.979> has<00:01:32.100> been<00:01:32.520> so<00:01:32.759> weak

00:01:33.160 --> 00:01:33.170 
of the reasons the euro has been so weak

00:01:33.170 --> 00:01:35.719 
of the reasons the euro has been so weak
why<00:01:34.170> do<00:01:34.229> you<00:01:34.439> believe<00:01:34.619> that<00:01:35.009> it<00:01:35.130> won't<00:01:35.310> work<00:01:35.490> in

00:01:35.719 --> 00:01:35.729 
why do you believe that it won't work in

00:01:35.729 --> 00:01:37.310 
why do you believe that it won't work in
Greece<00:01:35.970> and<00:01:36.180> ultimately<00:01:36.630> that<00:01:36.810> Spain<00:01:37.110> and

00:01:37.310 --> 00:01:37.320 
Greece and ultimately that Spain and

00:01:37.320 --> 00:01:41.330 
Greece and ultimately that Spain and
Portugal<00:01:37.500> will<00:01:37.950> suffer<00:01:38.310> a<00:01:38.340> similar<00:01:38.579> fate<00:01:40.340> well

00:01:41.330 --> 00:01:41.340 
Portugal will suffer a similar fate well

00:01:41.340 --> 00:01:45.080 
Portugal will suffer a similar fate well
I<00:01:41.369> think<00:01:41.579> the<00:01:41.909> pain<00:01:42.270> of<00:01:42.689> the<00:01:43.439> austerity<00:01:44.250> will

00:01:45.080 --> 00:01:45.090 
I think the pain of the austerity will

00:01:45.090 --> 00:01:49.780 
I think the pain of the austerity will
be<00:01:45.329> very<00:01:46.110> very<00:01:46.229> burdensome<00:01:47.130> on<00:01:47.579> Greece<00:01:48.149> and

00:01:49.780 --> 00:01:49.790 
be very very burdensome on Greece and

00:01:49.790 --> 00:01:54.889 
be very very burdensome on Greece and
eventually<00:01:51.710> the<00:01:52.710> economy<00:01:53.220> cannot<00:01:53.640> grow<00:01:54.119> with

00:01:54.889 --> 00:01:54.899 
eventually the economy cannot grow with

00:01:54.899 --> 00:01:58.249 
eventually the economy cannot grow with
the<00:01:55.770> kind<00:01:56.070> of<00:01:56.250> budget<00:01:57.210> they<00:01:57.479> will<00:01:57.689> have<00:01:58.020> to

00:01:58.249 --> 00:01:58.259 
the kind of budget they will have to

00:01:58.259 --> 00:02:01.490 
the kind of budget they will have to
enact<00:01:58.530> and<00:01:58.920> under<00:01:59.909> these<00:02:00.119> conditions<00:02:00.500> their

00:02:01.490 --> 00:02:01.500 
enact and under these conditions their

00:02:01.500 --> 00:02:04.039 
enact and under these conditions their
currency<00:02:02.159> is<00:02:02.369> way<00:02:02.670> overvalued<00:02:03.119> they<00:02:03.719> me<00:02:03.899> the

00:02:04.039 --> 00:02:04.049 
currency is way overvalued they me the

00:02:04.049 --> 00:02:08.389 
currency is way overvalued they me the
euro<00:02:04.320> and<00:02:04.880> so<00:02:06.140> without<00:02:07.140> the<00:02:07.530> ability<00:02:07.740> to<00:02:08.160> grow

00:02:08.389 --> 00:02:08.399 
euro and so without the ability to grow

00:02:08.399 --> 00:02:10.040 
euro and so without the ability to grow
their<00:02:08.789> ability<00:02:09.390> to<00:02:09.509> actually<00:02:09.660> pay<00:02:09.989> the

00:02:10.040 --> 00:02:10.050 
their ability to actually pay the

00:02:10.050 --> 00:02:12.130 
their ability to actually pay the
interest<00:02:10.470> and<00:02:10.709> repay<00:02:11.069> the<00:02:11.099> debts

00:02:12.130 --> 00:02:12.140 
interest and repay the debts

00:02:12.140 --> 00:02:14.770 
interest and repay the debts
we'll<00:02:12.319> actually<00:02:12.500> diminish<00:02:13.540> this<00:02:14.540> is<00:02:14.750> a

00:02:14.770 --> 00:02:14.780 
we'll actually diminish this is a

00:02:14.780 --> 00:02:16.630 
we'll actually diminish this is a
long-term<00:02:15.470> issue<00:02:15.770> though<00:02:16.130> is<00:02:16.160> it<00:02:16.459> not

00:02:16.630 --> 00:02:16.640 
long-term issue though is it not

00:02:16.640 --> 00:02:20.220 
long-term issue though is it not
something<00:02:17.120> that<00:02:17.240> will<00:02:17.360> play<00:02:17.569> out<00:02:17.600> over<00:02:17.780> years

00:02:20.220 --> 00:02:20.230 
something that will play out over years

00:02:20.230 --> 00:02:23.470 
something that will play out over years
yes<00:02:21.230> over<00:02:21.680> years<00:02:22.069> and<00:02:22.370> you<00:02:23.060> know<00:02:23.180> what<00:02:23.360> it

00:02:23.470 --> 00:02:23.480 
yes over years and you know what it

00:02:23.480 --> 00:02:26.500 
yes over years and you know what it
basically<00:02:23.720> means<00:02:24.350> is<00:02:24.740> that<00:02:25.300> governments<00:02:26.300> like

00:02:26.500 --> 00:02:26.510 
basically means is that governments like

00:02:26.510 --> 00:02:28.690 
basically means is that governments like
the<00:02:26.660> federal<00:02:27.080> government<00:02:27.680> in<00:02:27.890> the<00:02:28.100> US<00:02:28.430> will

00:02:28.690 --> 00:02:28.700 
the federal government in the US will

00:02:28.700 --> 00:02:30.580 
the federal government in the US will
have<00:02:28.880> to<00:02:29.060> bail<00:02:29.300> out<00:02:29.330> some<00:02:29.959> states<00:02:30.350> like

00:02:30.580 --> 00:02:30.590 
have to bail out some states like

00:02:30.590 --> 00:02:33.190 
have to bail out some states like
Illinois<00:02:30.950> and<00:02:31.760> California<00:02:32.000> and<00:02:32.750> in<00:02:32.870> Europe

00:02:33.190 --> 00:02:33.200 
Illinois and California and in Europe

00:02:33.200 --> 00:02:35.490 
Illinois and California and in Europe
they<00:02:33.380> have<00:02:33.560> to<00:02:33.770> bail<00:02:34.220> out<00:02:34.250> weaker<00:02:35.060> countries

00:02:35.490 --> 00:02:35.500 
they have to bail out weaker countries

00:02:35.500 --> 00:02:40.449 
they have to bail out weaker countries
like<00:02:36.500> Greece<00:02:37.540> Portugal<00:02:38.540> Spain<00:02:39.230> and<00:02:40.040> probably

00:02:40.449 --> 00:02:40.459 
like Greece Portugal Spain and probably

00:02:40.459 --> 00:02:43.860 
like Greece Portugal Spain and probably
eventually<00:02:40.670> also<00:02:41.150> Italy<00:02:41.810> and<00:02:42.310> so<00:02:43.310> it<00:02:43.550> means

00:02:43.860 --> 00:02:43.870 
eventually also Italy and so it means

00:02:43.870 --> 00:02:46.690 
eventually also Italy and so it means
monetization<00:02:44.870> which<00:02:45.290> is<00:02:45.470> not<00:02:45.680> all<00:02:45.920> that<00:02:45.980> bad

00:02:46.690 --> 00:02:46.700 
monetization which is not all that bad

00:02:46.700 --> 00:02:49.150 
monetization which is not all that bad
for<00:02:46.760> equities<00:02:47.720> but<00:02:48.410> of<00:02:48.560> course<00:02:48.830> it's<00:02:49.070> not

00:02:49.150 --> 00:02:49.160 
for equities but of course it's not

00:02:49.160 --> 00:02:51.910 
for equities but of course it's not
favorable<00:02:49.910> for<00:02:50.150> bonds<00:02:50.900> for<00:02:51.140> government<00:02:51.650> bonds

00:02:51.910 --> 00:02:51.920 
favorable for bonds for government bonds

00:02:51.920 --> 00:02:54.759

Vietnamese shares then us shares because

Vietnamese shares then us shares because
I<00:05:23.110> can<00:05:23.320> make<00:05:23.470> a<00:05:23.500> case<00:05:23.889> that<00:05:24.190> the<00:05:24.880> economy<00:05:25.150> there

00:05:25.590 --> 00:05:25.600 
I can make a case that the economy there

00:05:25.600 --> 00:05:27.600 
I can make a case that the economy there
will<00:05:25.840> grow<00:05:26.139> much<00:05:26.440> faster<00:05:26.470> than<00:05:27.190> in<00:05:27.310> the<00:05:27.430> United

i<00:06:58.610> would<00:06:58.669> estimate<00:06:59.000> that<00:06:59.360> between<00:06:59.600> thirty<00:07:00.410> to

i would estimate that between thirty to

00:07:00.710 --> 00:07:03.700 
i would estimate that between thirty to
fifty<00:07:00.980> percent<00:07:01.639> of<00:07:01.880> tax<00:07:02.150> revenues<00:07:02.660> will<00:07:03.380> be

fifty percent of tax revenues will be

00:07:03.710 --> 00:07:06.580 
fifty percent of tax revenues will be
spent<00:07:04.280> on<00:07:04.580> the<00:07:05.360> interest<00:07:05.870> payments<00:07:06.380> on<00:07:06.470> the

00:07:08.950 --> 00:07:08.960 
government debt and that will then prove

00:07:08.960 --> 00:07:12.010 
government debt and that will then prove
to<00:07:08.990> be<00:07:09.229> a<00:07:09.380> huge<00:07:09.770> problem<00:07:10.070> and<00:07:11.020> necessitates

00:07:12.010 --> 00:07:12.020 
to be a huge problem and necessitates

00:07:12.020 --> 00:07:14.920 
to be a huge problem and necessitates
the<00:07:12.430> monetization<00:07:13.430> necessity<00:07:14.360> of<00:07:14.389> the<00:07:14.690> date

00:07:14.920 --> 00:07:14.930 
the monetization necessity of the date

00:07:14.930 --> 00:07:17.850 
the monetization necessity of the date
and<00:07:15.229> that<00:07:15.950> will<00:07:16.220> lead<00:07:16.400> to<00:07:16.430> a<00:07:16.610> weak<00:07:16.880> dollar<00:07:17.240> and

00:07:17.850 --> 00:07:17.860 
and that will lead to a weak dollar and

00:07:17.860 --> 00:07:19.840 
and that will lead to a weak dollar and
