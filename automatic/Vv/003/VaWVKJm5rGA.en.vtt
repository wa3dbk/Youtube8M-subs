00:00:24.820 --> 00:00:24.830 
videos i did on my site where i used to

00:00:24.830 --> 00:00:28.779 
videos i did on my site where i used to
some<00:00:25.220> of<00:00:25.310> the<00:00:25.400> some<00:00:26.680> l<00:00:27.680> bracket<00:00:28.250> bolt<00:00:28.610> on

00:00:28.779 --> 00:00:28.789 
some of the some l bracket bolt on

00:00:28.789 --> 00:00:31.330 
some of the some l bracket bolt on
pieces<00:00:29.260> and<00:00:30.260> i<00:00:30.470> did<00:00:30.650> not<00:00:30.680> like<00:00:31.010> the<00:00:31.100> way<00:00:31.130> that

00:00:31.330 --> 00:00:31.340 
pieces and i did not like the way that

00:00:31.340 --> 00:00:33.579 
pieces and i did not like the way that
looked<00:00:31.580> a<00:00:31.760> heads<00:00:31.910> up<00:00:32.059> ma<00:00:32.210> u<00:00:32.809> bolts<00:00:33.170> and<00:00:33.379> the

looked a heads up ma u bolts and the

00:00:33.589 --> 00:00:37.029 
looked a heads up ma u bolts and the
crossbars<00:00:34.190> were<00:00:34.489> these<00:00:35.179> uh<00:00:35.239> gas<00:00:36.079> pipe<00:00:36.379> iron

00:00:37.029 --> 00:00:37.039 
crossbars were these uh gas pipe iron

00:00:37.039 --> 00:00:39.939 
crossbars were these uh gas pipe iron
gas<00:00:37.309> pipe<00:00:37.489> or<00:00:37.699> whatever<00:00:37.909> that<00:00:37.969> is<00:00:38.589> so<00:00:39.589> i<00:00:39.620> went

00:00:39.939 --> 00:00:39.949 
gas pipe or whatever that is so i went

00:00:39.949 --> 00:00:41.259 
gas pipe or whatever that is so i went
with<00:00:40.069> something<00:00:40.309> different<00:00:40.760> i<00:00:40.850> wanted<00:00:41.149> to

00:00:41.259 --> 00:00:41.269 
with something different i wanted to

00:00:41.269 --> 00:00:43.299 
with something different i wanted to
have<00:00:41.690> a<00:00:41.719> different<00:00:41.929> cross<00:00:42.229> bar<00:00:42.499> so<00:00:42.949> i<00:00:43.010> kept<00:00:43.249> the

00:00:43.299 --> 00:00:43.309 
have a different cross bar so i kept the

00:00:43.309 --> 00:00:44.950 
have a different cross bar so i kept the
same<00:00:43.489> uprights<00:00:43.909> they're<00:00:44.120> still<00:00:44.329> bolt<00:00:44.539> on<00:00:44.719> so<00:00:44.929> i

00:00:44.950 --> 00:00:44.960 
same uprights they're still bolt on so i

00:00:44.960 --> 00:00:47.379 
same uprights they're still bolt on so i
can<00:00:45.170> screw<00:00:45.829> it<00:00:45.920> into<00:00:46.039> the<00:00:46.219> rail<00:00:46.819> system<00:00:47.210> on<00:00:47.329> the

00:00:47.379 --> 00:00:47.389 
can screw it into the rail system on the

00:00:47.389 --> 00:00:51.520 
can screw it into the rail system on the
toyota<00:00:47.889> but<00:00:48.889> this<00:00:49.479> it's<00:00:50.479> brown<00:00:50.780> it<00:00:51.499> looks

00:00:51.520 --> 00:00:51.530 
toyota but this it's brown it looks

00:00:51.530 --> 00:00:55.569 
toyota but this it's brown it looks
familiar<00:00:51.909> is<00:00:52.909> actually<00:00:53.949> just<00:00:54.949> part<00:00:55.249> of<00:00:55.309> a<00:00:55.429> bed

00:00:55.569 --> 00:00:55.579 
familiar is actually just part of a bed

00:00:55.579 --> 00:00:58.509 
familiar is actually just part of a bed
frame<00:00:55.789> so<00:00:56.269> this<00:00:56.539> is<00:00:56.569> actually<00:00:56.839> the<00:00:57.339> short<00:00:58.339> end

00:00:58.509 --> 00:00:58.519 
frame so this is actually the short end

00:00:58.519 --> 00:01:00.250 
frame so this is actually the short end
like<00:00:58.969> of<00:00:59.120> a<00:00:59.209> twin<00:00:59.449> bed<00:00:59.629> that<00:00:59.899> goes<00:01:00.049> together

00:01:00.250 --> 00:01:00.260 
like of a twin bed that goes together

00:01:00.260 --> 00:01:03.789 
like of a twin bed that goes together
this<00:01:00.769> is<00:01:00.949> about<00:01:01.159> like<00:01:01.929> 60<00:01:02.929> inches<00:01:03.170> wide<00:01:03.350> which

00:01:03.789 --> 00:01:03.799 
this is about like 60 inches wide which

00:01:03.799 --> 00:01:07.300 
this is about like 60 inches wide which
is<00:01:04.250> I<00:01:04.519> think<00:01:04.610> what<00:01:05.420> my<00:01:05.780> the<00:01:06.590> width<00:01:06.829> of<00:01:06.950> my<00:01:07.009> truck

00:01:07.300 --> 00:01:07.310 
is I think what my the width of my truck

00:01:07.310 --> 00:01:11.200 
is I think what my the width of my truck
bed<00:01:07.460> is<00:01:07.719> so<00:01:08.719> all<00:01:09.350> I<00:01:09.380> did<00:01:09.530> was<00:01:09.880> cut<00:01:10.880> this<00:01:11.000> off

00:01:11.200 --> 00:01:11.210 
bed is so all I did was cut this off

00:01:11.210 --> 00:01:14.380 
bed is so all I did was cut this off
with<00:01:11.390> my<00:01:11.509> grinder<00:01:11.930> to<00:01:12.920> the<00:01:13.039> right<00:01:13.250> length<00:01:14.030> a

00:01:14.380 --> 00:01:14.390 
with my grinder to the right length a

00:01:14.390 --> 00:01:17.709 
with my grinder to the right length a
bolt<00:01:15.259> little<00:01:15.500> on<00:01:15.680> the<00:01:15.740> top<00:01:16.390> and<00:01:17.390> now<00:01:17.509> I'm<00:01:17.600> going

00:01:17.709 --> 00:01:17.719 
bolt little on the top and now I'm going

00:01:17.719 --> 00:01:20.440 
bolt little on the top and now I'm going
to<00:01:17.780> paint<00:01:17.960> them<00:01:18.109> so<00:01:18.759> I'm<00:01:19.759> gonna<00:01:19.939> get<00:01:20.149> those<00:01:20.240> on

00:01:20.440 --> 00:01:20.450 
to paint them so I'm gonna get those on

00:01:20.450 --> 00:01:24.249 
to paint them so I'm gonna get those on
there<00:01:20.600> these<00:01:21.200> little<00:01:21.409> pieces<00:01:22.960> actually<00:01:23.960> had

00:01:24.249 --> 00:01:24.259 
there these little pieces actually had

00:01:24.259 --> 00:01:27.580 
there these little pieces actually had
to<00:01:24.350> buy<00:01:24.469> this<00:01:24.530> tonight<00:01:24.950> at<00:01:25.159> home<00:01:26.119> depot<00:01:26.539> I<00:01:26.780> just

00:01:27.580 --> 00:01:27.590 
to buy this tonight at home depot I just

00:01:27.590 --> 00:01:30.370 
to buy this tonight at home depot I just
made<00:01:27.740> some<00:01:27.770> small<00:01:28.490> segments<00:01:29.119> to<00:01:29.420> wear<00:01:29.630> when

00:01:30.370 --> 00:01:30.380 
made some small segments to wear when

00:01:30.380 --> 00:01:33.279 
made some small segments to wear when
it's<00:01:30.560> in<00:01:30.679> the<00:01:30.799> truck<00:01:31.210> if<00:01:32.210> it's<00:01:32.509> just<00:01:32.810> as<00:01:33.020> is

00:01:33.279 --> 00:01:33.289 
it's in the truck if it's just as is

00:01:33.289 --> 00:01:35.169 
it's in the truck if it's just as is
like<00:01:33.500> that<00:01:33.649> but<00:01:33.829> even<00:01:34.159> bolted<00:01:34.340> in<00:01:34.609> it<00:01:34.880> still

00:01:35.169 --> 00:01:35.179 
like that but even bolted in it still

00:01:35.179 --> 00:01:37.090 
like that but even bolted in it still
has<00:01:35.329> a<00:01:35.359> little<00:01:35.450> wobble<00:01:35.840> and<00:01:36.109> play<00:01:36.320> in<00:01:36.500> it<00:01:36.590> so

00:01:37.090 --> 00:01:37.100 
has a little wobble and play in it so

00:01:37.100 --> 00:01:39.999 
has a little wobble and play in it so
this<00:01:37.250> is<00:01:37.399> going<00:01:37.549> to<00:01:37.609> act<00:01:37.729> as<00:01:37.909> a<00:01:38.409> brace<00:01:39.409> so<00:01:39.829> this

00:01:39.999 --> 00:01:40.009 
this is going to act as a brace so this

00:01:40.009 --> 00:01:42.880 
this is going to act as a brace so this
will<00:01:40.130> be<00:01:40.329> attached<00:01:41.329> to<00:01:41.630> the<00:01:41.929> rail<00:01:42.289> system<00:01:42.710> and

00:01:42.880 --> 00:01:42.890 
will be attached to the rail system and

00:01:42.890 --> 00:01:45.039 
will be attached to the rail system and
then<00:01:43.189> rush<00:01:43.640> through<00:01:43.820> the<00:01:43.909> upright<00:01:44.210> so<00:01:44.479> that'll

00:01:45.039 --> 00:01:45.049 
then rush through the upright so that'll

00:01:45.049 --> 00:01:47.289 
then rush through the upright so that'll
give<00:01:45.079> it<00:01:45.289> quite<00:01:45.469> a<00:01:45.530> bit<00:01:45.590> more<00:01:45.829> sports<00:01:46.219> I<00:01:46.759> hope

00:01:47.289 --> 00:01:47.299 
give it quite a bit more sports I hope

00:01:47.299 --> 00:01:48.789 
give it quite a bit more sports I hope
those<00:01:47.479> are<00:01:47.600> long<00:01:47.780> enough<00:01:47.960> I<00:01:48.170> think<00:01:48.200> that<00:01:48.710> was

00:01:48.789 --> 00:01:48.799 
those are long enough I think that was

00:01:48.799 --> 00:01:51.160 
those are long enough I think that was
just<00:01:48.950> one<00:01:49.070> piece<00:01:49.280> I<00:01:49.429> cut<00:01:49.609> in<00:01:49.729> fourths<00:01:50.090> so<00:01:50.270> we'll

00:01:51.160 --> 00:01:51.170 
just one piece I cut in fourths so we'll

00:01:51.170 --> 00:01:53.739 
just one piece I cut in fourths so we'll
give<00:01:51.259> it<00:01:51.320> a<00:01:51.409> try<00:01:51.549> I'm<00:01:52.549> gonna<00:01:52.700> paint<00:01:52.939> it<00:01:53.060> all

00:01:53.739 --> 00:01:53.749 
give it a try I'm gonna paint it all

00:01:53.749 --> 00:01:59.410 
give it a try I'm gonna paint it all
black<00:01:54.530> or<00:01:54.829> maybe<00:01:55.280> a<00:01:55.749> little<00:01:56.749> bit<00:01:56.979> camo<00:01:58.210> and<00:01:59.210> I
