together<00:04:30.720> see<00:04:30.960> they<00:04:31.410> look<00:04:31.620> like<00:04:33.140> they<00:04:34.140> did<00:04:34.170> on

00:04:35.170 --> 00:04:35.180 
together see they look like they did on

00:04:35.180 --> 00:04:37.010 
together see they look like they did on
Photoshop<00:04:36.180> except<00:04:36.480> their<00:04:36.600> piece<00:04:36.750> back

00:04:37.010 --> 00:04:37.020 
Photoshop except their piece back

00:04:37.020 --> 00:04:39.470 
Photoshop except their piece back

00:04:39.470 --> 00:04:39.480 
together and but they are all in

00:04:39.480 --> 00:04:42.620 
together and but they are all in
sections<00:04:39.960> so<00:04:40.800> if<00:04:41.010> we<00:04:41.100> go<00:04:41.220> to<00:04:41.280> the<00:04:41.430> folder<00:04:42.240> now

00:04:42.620 --> 00:04:42.630 
sections so if we go to the folder now

00:04:42.630 --> 00:04:44.240 
sections so if we go to the folder now
the<00:04:43.050> images<00:04:43.380> folder<00:04:43.410> which<00:04:43.830> is<00:04:43.950> obviously

the images folder which is obviously

00:04:44.250 --> 00:04:46.460 
the images folder which is obviously
also<00:04:44.520> been<00:04:44.820> correct<00:04:45.090> created<00:04:45.600> there<00:04:46.200> are<00:04:46.350> all

00:04:46.460 --> 00:04:46.470 
also been correct created there are all

00:04:46.470 --> 00:04:48.830 
also been correct created there are all
our<00:04:46.650> arable<00:04:47.580> our<00:04:47.700> slices<00:04:47.970> there<00:04:48.510> are<00:04:48.600> all<00:04:48.690> the

00:04:48.830 --> 00:04:48.840 
our arable our slices there are all the

00:04:48.840 --> 00:04:50.960 
our arable our slices there are all the
different<00:04:49.170> image<00:04:49.800> slices<00:04:50.370> that<00:04:50.550> we've<00:04:50.700> saved

00:04:50.960 --> 00:04:50.970 
different image slices that we've saved

00:04:50.970 --> 00:04:54.620

00:04:54.620 --> 00:04:54.630 
so that's how to do slicing in Photoshop

00:04:54.630 --> 00:04:56.420 
so that's how to do slicing in Photoshop
