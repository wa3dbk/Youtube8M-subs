00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.770
 ok guys then for everything from 

00:00:03.120 --> 00:00:07.290
 assumption in this video you will see one 

00:00:04.770 --> 00:00:09.990
 notch for a variety of reasons why not 

00:00:07.290 --> 00:00:12.059
 I can assemble it because as you know that 

00:00:09.990 --> 00:00:14.670
 who follows me in short, who has seen 

00:00:12.059 --> 00:00:19.080
 the last video the fact is that the 

00:00:14.670 --> 00:00:22.289
 computer not only that they will color here 

00:00:19.080 --> 00:00:23.880
 montevideo and other consequences there is more 

00:00:22.289 --> 00:00:27.539
 problem that type all the computers of 

00:00:23.880 --> 00:00:29.010
 my dad's got stuff like that you did n't 

00:00:27.539 --> 00:00:30.480
 so I 'm not with movies 

00:00:29.010 --> 00:00:33.960
 absolutely like this video if not 

00:00:30.480 --> 00:00:37.050
 so and anyway so it will be a video a 

00:00:33.960 --> 00:00:38.309
 a bit so a little on the road 

00:00:37.050 --> 00:00:40.590
 then this video in collaboration 

00:00:38.309 --> 00:00:42.660
 with julian than a girl at home 

00:00:40.590 --> 00:00:45.510
 your collaboration on facebook that 

00:00:42.660 --> 00:00:47.160
 greetings to all and one channel on youtube 

00:00:45.510 --> 00:00:48.210
 which is called if the mistake Julia 

00:00:47.160 --> 00:00:49.829
 make up outfits 

00:00:48.210 --> 00:00:52.530
 I hope I'm not wrong anyway 

00:00:49.829 --> 00:00:55.230
 I leave his channel here he has placed himself not 

00:00:52.530 --> 00:00:56.969
 i love the region the info box and this video 

00:00:55.230 --> 00:00:58.890
 as me directed by the title and the video on 

00:00:56.969 --> 00:01:00.510
 a fit for Valentine's day that actually 

00:00:58.890 --> 00:01:02.039
 not just whether or not I would do 

00:01:00.510 --> 00:01:05.369
 wanted to shoot this way but for one 

00:01:02.039 --> 00:01:06.960
 series of reasons from here is bad they know that 

00:01:05.369 --> 00:01:09.030
 we didn't have the time there so 

00:01:06.960 --> 00:01:12.860
 I already wanted from the outside with a cameraman 

00:01:09.030 --> 00:01:15.630
 but worse for him 

00:01:12.860 --> 00:01:17.729
 and therefore nothing ready sky ride in 

00:01:15.630 --> 00:01:19.650
 this way a little bit so then 

00:01:17.729 --> 00:01:21.689
 the very simple home my neighbor 

00:01:19.650 --> 00:01:23.340
 I start from the accessories even if they are not 

00:01:21.689 --> 00:01:26.009
 particularly little in this 

00:01:23.340 --> 00:01:29.460
 easel is particularly loose not 

00:01:26.009 --> 00:01:32.729
 He has cursed fire then how 

00:01:29.460 --> 00:01:36.060
 rich this while this neck of 

00:01:32.729 --> 00:01:38.189
 flat edge above all unlock 

00:01:36.060 --> 00:01:39.840
 because I'm cold and mine is underneath 

00:01:38.189 --> 00:01:42.119
 quality with heart shape line 

00:01:39.840 --> 00:01:44.640
 the water you drink for every video you take 

00:01:42.119 --> 00:01:46.500
 those who ask me do not know where to buy it 

00:01:44.640 --> 00:01:48.810
 because it was given to me by Alessandro Bel 

00:01:46.500 --> 00:01:51.689
 some time ago this summer then how 

00:01:48.810 --> 00:01:54.119
 earrings this pair this pair 

00:01:51.689 --> 00:01:57.030
 of earrings to accessorize that I don't know if 

00:01:54.119 --> 00:01:59.340
 see, however, it is a heart of the trunk 

00:01:57.030 --> 00:02:00.630
 areas inside a heart that all turn 

00:01:59.340 --> 00:02:02.430
 gold color 

00:02:00.630 --> 00:02:05.130
 then as rings or the usual in that 

00:02:02.430 --> 00:02:08.879
 I always carry these three that I am of 

00:02:05.130 --> 00:02:09.500
 Claire I 'm wrong , I'm a trio of 

00:02:08.879 --> 00:02:11.780
 three rings 

00:02:09.500 --> 00:02:14.150
 pink the light sucks is because it is ugly 

00:02:11.780 --> 00:02:16.040
 time and that lamp is burned out of 

00:02:14.150 --> 00:02:18.500
 here I have my two bracelets goes well it is 

00:02:16.040 --> 00:02:20.750
 a bracelet of pearls and instead of 

00:02:18.500 --> 00:02:24.430
 this other part or this bracelet 

00:02:20.750 --> 00:02:28.280
 factors all all the blocks 

00:02:24.430 --> 00:02:31.970
 brown that the wind on 

00:02:28.280 --> 00:02:34.400
 lungotevere well and there is always gex be 

00:02:31.970 --> 00:02:36.470
 a long time ago then then me 

00:02:34.400 --> 00:02:40.090
 they move away even though I will no longer be a 

00:02:36.470 --> 00:02:43.220
 fire how do I do the little for here 

00:02:40.090 --> 00:02:45.050
 ok i hope to be in focus then later 

00:02:43.220 --> 00:02:46.940
 just the machine then above a 

00:02:45.050 --> 00:02:50.660
 part of the neck of this blouse here 

00:02:46.940 --> 00:02:53.390
 that you saw in a video of thousands 

00:02:50.660 --> 00:02:55.010
 makes me that it's a mango blouse with 

00:02:53.390 --> 00:02:56.750
 all is fine a white vest 

00:02:55.010 --> 00:02:58.580
 simple bang the cinema that talks 

00:02:56.750 --> 00:02:59.870
 because it is a bit transparent therefore for 

00:02:58.580 --> 00:03:02.360
 force I have to put something 

00:02:59.870 --> 00:03:06.590
 and since it is quite in forms like 

00:03:02.360 --> 00:03:08.239
 the gentleman often gladly garden 

00:03:06.590 --> 00:03:11.700
 this centina that in reality is not the 

00:03:08.239 --> 00:03:14.850
 rib or has type 

00:03:11.700 --> 00:03:16.950
 a fake leather braid 

00:03:14.850 --> 00:03:20.350
 brownish with which I make a bow 

00:03:16.950 --> 00:03:24.670
 nothing and then above all I put this 

00:03:20.350 --> 00:03:27.820
 brown curtains which is by tezenis la 

00:03:24.670 --> 00:03:30.550
 full coverage my mom on sale is 

00:03:27.820 --> 00:03:32.200
 very simple and to the buttons here of 

00:03:30.550 --> 00:03:33.550
 side and the camera was long 

00:03:32.200 --> 00:03:36.700
 so I'll show you the rest 

00:03:33.550 --> 00:03:37.410
 sorry if you see today but I can't 

00:03:36.700 --> 00:03:40.390
 doing nothing 

00:03:37.410 --> 00:03:42.910
 then and see more or less up here 

00:03:40.390 --> 00:03:45.100
 and al and pockets in which on the sides then 

00:03:42.910 --> 00:03:46.600
 under this pair of jeans that are more 

00:03:45.100 --> 00:03:50.500
 or less of the same brand of the same 

00:03:46.600 --> 00:03:54.280
 color of the scarf and are of zara are 

00:03:50.500 --> 00:03:57.070
 in short, they are the year of the year 

00:03:54.280 --> 00:03:59.500
 here the zipper at the bottom and then 

00:03:57.070 --> 00:04:01.360
 finally I trying to recreate an outfit 

00:03:59.500 --> 00:04:04.120
 enough to the mantico for san valentino 

00:04:01.360 --> 00:04:05.400
 in that portable house so if not 

00:04:04.120 --> 00:04:07.930
 you want to put on your heels 

00:04:05.400 --> 00:04:09.400
 you can easily match it very easily 

00:04:07.930 --> 00:04:11.050
 accompanies the ankle boots because second 

00:04:09.400 --> 00:04:14.140
 I still like it there 

00:04:11.050 --> 00:04:15.670
 I went to school today and shoes 

00:04:14.140 --> 00:04:17.980
 these are the ones of primadonna who 

00:04:15.670 --> 00:04:20.169
 we put a picture on the page 

00:04:17.980 --> 00:04:22.390
 if you want to see better I am very 

00:04:20.169 --> 00:04:24.930
 cute and very elegant a tempino others 

00:04:22.390 --> 00:04:27.250
 a little bit uncomfortable though for 

00:04:24.930 --> 00:04:29.440
 such elegant situations, however, yes 

00:04:27.250 --> 00:04:31.600
 they can wear and they are very pretty 

00:04:29.440 --> 00:04:35.640
 they are brownish, but they are all made 

00:04:31.600 --> 00:04:38.620
 in a suede-like suede obviously 

00:04:35.640 --> 00:04:40.560
 year the darker brown border the 

00:04:38.620 --> 00:04:46.210
 shoe color depends on the correct 

00:04:40.560 --> 00:04:48.400
 upside damage I get back up then I don't 

00:04:46.210 --> 00:04:50.620
 is still under the same concludes shoes 

00:04:48.400 --> 00:04:52.870
 will fire will be in focus we hope so 

00:04:50.620 --> 00:04:54.610
 then it goes well I wanted to show you the 

00:04:52.870 --> 00:04:56.980
 but in reality I am a hospital 

00:04:54.610 --> 00:05:00.070
 putting on lipstick is therefore a trio 

00:04:56.980 --> 00:05:04.750
 but a lipstick is paired, I'll tell you 

00:05:00.070 --> 00:05:07.530
 I'll show you this anyway 

00:05:04.750 --> 00:05:10.930
 I treat here that of the last collection 

00:05:07.530 --> 00:05:12.370
 he was very very nice and he would have given us 

00:05:10.930 --> 00:05:14.710
 this because of the same and the ancient 

00:05:12.370 --> 00:05:16.150
 color of the enamel I wear that 

00:05:14.710 --> 00:05:17.169
 this disposed of some of the enamel of 

00:05:16.150 --> 00:05:20.800
 debora flame 

00:05:17.169 --> 00:05:24.460
 apart and is called red chiffon rose 

00:05:20.800 --> 00:05:27.879
 chiffon and is quite old rose type 

00:05:24.460 --> 00:05:31.120
 dark beautiful and then like makeup port 

00:05:27.879 --> 00:05:33.789
 on the eyes a little faded gold with a 

00:05:31.120 --> 00:05:35.740
 bit of edge type in the crease but you don't 

00:05:33.789 --> 00:05:39.639
 you will see absolutely nothing for yourself 

00:05:35.740 --> 00:05:41.169
 this video a little and ignore it 

00:05:39.639 --> 00:05:43.029
 trick because I did this morning and 

00:05:41.169 --> 00:05:45.039
 okay nothing so this here is my 

00:05:43.029 --> 00:05:47.139
 outfit for Valentine's Day that I would have 

00:05:45.039 --> 00:05:49.960
 wanted to shoot a little better a little more 

00:05:47.139 --> 00:05:52.330
 it is better not to say a little better 

00:05:49.960 --> 00:05:54.249
 but I did not succeed, however, I hope 

00:05:52.330 --> 00:05:55.839
 however you enjoyed it if you wanted 

00:05:54.249 --> 00:05:57.759
 between breathing if you have drawn 

00:05:55.839 --> 00:06:01.689
