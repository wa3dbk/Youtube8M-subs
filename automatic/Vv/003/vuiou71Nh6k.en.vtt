00:00:00.350 --> 00:00:06.620
 here we are this fantastic day of the post 

00:00:05.040 --> 00:00:09.719
 Derby 

00:00:06.620 --> 00:00:13.170
 lots of waiting for this game 

00:00:09.719 --> 00:00:15.330
 a lot of desire to win by mortgage 

00:00:13.170 --> 00:00:17.220
 place in europe to prove that we are 

00:00:15.330 --> 00:00:19.080
 a team with the character to demonstrate 

00:00:17.220 --> 00:00:20.730
 that we are a team that has understood 

00:00:19.080 --> 00:00:22.170
 from the mistakes we have in the past 

00:00:20.730 --> 00:00:23.519
 courage that we want to jump 

00:00:22.170 --> 00:00:25.470
 in the fray we want to be one 

00:00:23.519 --> 00:00:27.420
 team that is being built and therefore 

00:00:25.470 --> 00:00:29.220
 to bet on next year and then 

00:00:27.420 --> 00:00:32.300
 all these good assumptions too 

00:00:29.220 --> 00:00:35.370
 nice words then the inter goes into the field and 

00:00:32.300 --> 00:00:38.850
 does what no one should ever do 

00:00:35.370 --> 00:00:41.820
 that is, it does not play so it is not so much the 

00:00:38.850 --> 00:00:43.500
 You can talk about losing or winning 

00:00:41.820 --> 00:00:44.520
 you can also lose a derby 

00:00:43.500 --> 00:00:47.010
 lose a game 

00:00:44.520 --> 00:00:48.870
 our team does not consist of 

00:00:47.010 --> 00:00:50.820
 top quality players then 

00:00:48.870 --> 00:00:52.739
 these things we know we can lose 

00:00:50.820 --> 00:00:55.559
 the derby can lose a game 

00:00:52.739 --> 00:00:56.940
 I repeat, but you cannot lose face 

00:00:55.559 --> 00:01:01.129
 you can not enter the field without 

00:00:56.940 --> 00:01:04.110
 play giving up any kind of 

00:01:01.129 --> 00:01:05.700
 scheme of desire to offend to do 

00:01:04.110 --> 00:01:07.530
 hurt the opponent by leaving the field 

00:01:05.700 --> 00:01:10.950
 to the opponent that an opponent between 

00:01:07.530 --> 00:01:12.570
 the other in difficulty and nothing one 

00:01:10.950 --> 00:01:15.390
 team without soul the team if not 

00:01:12.570 --> 00:01:16.979
 only without games but without souls 

00:01:15.390 --> 00:01:19.860
 this year we found ourselves here in 

00:01:16.979 --> 00:01:21.330
 say that after a couple of victories it was 

00:01:19.860 --> 00:01:23.009
 important to give continuity was 

00:01:21.330 --> 00:01:25.619
 important to make the decisive leap in the 

00:01:23.009 --> 00:01:27.780
 important moments to succeed in winning 

00:01:25.619 --> 00:01:29.579
 the game that could possibly get you closer 

00:01:27.780 --> 00:01:31.680
 first place third then fourth 

00:01:29.579 --> 00:01:33.420
 then to define you for the europa league 

00:01:31.680 --> 00:01:35.850
 and instead every time this year has been 

00:01:33.420 --> 00:01:38.430
 failed and failed badly because 

00:01:35.850 --> 00:01:40.979
 a repeat account is to lose an account is not 

00:01:38.430 --> 00:01:43.890
 play the inter yesterday enters the field in 

00:01:40.979 --> 00:01:45.630
 a very serious sense derby in any 

00:01:43.890 --> 00:01:47.729
 game but yesterday was a derby among other things 

00:01:45.630 --> 00:01:49.229
 important for the ranking is the inter 

00:01:47.729 --> 00:01:50.670
 back on the field then away not 

00:01:49.229 --> 00:01:53.360
 play soccer 

00:01:50.670 --> 00:01:57.689
 so this is a very serious thing 

00:01:53.360 --> 00:02:00.439
 very serious and unfortunately must give for 

00:01:57.689 --> 00:02:04.530
 force the responsibilities of the coach 

00:02:00.439 --> 00:02:05.369
 because the coach certainly has some 

00:02:04.530 --> 00:02:07.590
 justifications 

00:02:05.369 --> 00:02:11.039
 the material he has is not of the highest quality 

00:02:07.590 --> 00:02:13.920
 quality, however, enough with the refrain that 

00:02:11.039 --> 00:02:15.569
 you do what you can because it is not so 

00:02:13.920 --> 00:02:18.239
 it is not so because they are team come into 

00:02:15.569 --> 00:02:20.609
 field and not play is not a matter of 

00:02:18.239 --> 00:02:24.049
 of the interpreters the questions that 

00:02:20.609 --> 00:02:26.040
 team does not have a soul does not have one 

00:02:24.049 --> 00:02:28.950
 malice has no character does not have 

00:02:26.040 --> 00:02:31.079
 grit has no personality and these things 

00:02:28.950 --> 00:02:32.640
 in addition to the tactical level between the schemes 

00:02:31.079 --> 00:02:35.569
 game that is between these things you need 

00:02:32.640 --> 00:02:39.599
 transmit the coach possible me 

00:02:35.569 --> 00:02:41.939
 I'd understand if we were to October you know you have to 

00:02:39.599 --> 00:02:43.470
 still work but here we are in May 

00:02:41.939 --> 00:02:44.970
 missing two games at the end of 

00:02:43.470 --> 00:02:46.409
 championship this team is possible 

00:02:44.970 --> 00:02:49.349
 he only took a step back 

00:02:46.409 --> 00:02:51.120
 how can we think of reconstructing the 

00:02:49.349 --> 00:02:53.250
 future from next year with one 

00:02:51.120 --> 00:02:54.780
 team that has been alone since the beginning of the year 

00:02:53.250 --> 00:02:55.700
 step back and never took half a step 

00:02:54.780 --> 00:02:58.919
 forward 

00:02:55.700 --> 00:03:01.739
 I ask this question now 

00:02:58.919 --> 00:03:03.120
 talk the angry fan speaks the 

00:03:01.739 --> 00:03:05.459
 person looking for a justification 

00:03:03.120 --> 00:03:06.959
 but what happened yesterday is not the 

00:03:05.459 --> 00:03:08.790
 first time it happens 

00:03:06.959 --> 00:03:10.680
 it is not the first time and this makes me 

00:03:08.790 --> 00:03:12.480
 reflect because once there is a 

00:03:10.680 --> 00:03:15.120
 justification the second another 

00:03:12.480 --> 00:03:17.669
 third another still begins at 

00:03:15.120 --> 00:03:19.229
 be worrying why get to 

00:03:17.669 --> 00:03:21.239
 end of season and not see steps in 

00:03:19.229 --> 00:03:22.739
 forward I don't like the justification 

00:03:21.239 --> 00:03:24.599
 if we arrive then that among other things of 

00:03:22.739 --> 00:03:26.190
 don't get there if we arrive then 

00:03:24.599 --> 00:03:28.229
 we did with the we have to do 

00:03:26.190 --> 00:03:30.239
 no because it was not the position in 

00:03:28.229 --> 00:03:33.150
 ranking that judges the season 

00:03:30.239 --> 00:03:34.620
 never from how it came from how it is 

00:03:33.150 --> 00:03:37.260
 is played by how some are addressed 

00:03:34.620 --> 00:03:38.849
 particular matches and inter in this 

00:03:37.260 --> 00:03:40.709
 last year but above all in the last ones 

00:03:38.849 --> 00:03:42.569
 six months from the derby of the first leg has 

00:03:40.709 --> 00:03:45.959
 faced important matches always 

00:03:42.569 --> 00:03:46.829
 wrongly if and last 

00:03:45.959 --> 00:03:49.139
 results 

00:03:46.829 --> 00:03:53.340
 let's talk about draws with livorno bologna 

00:03:49.139 --> 00:03:54.870
 they were just signals that could be 

00:03:53.340 --> 00:03:56.519
 get to this at this point is a 

00:03:54.870 --> 00:03:59.459
 unfortunately we arrived at this point 

00:03:56.519 --> 00:04:00.150
 so if I were the management 

00:03:59.459 --> 00:04:03.079
 inter 

00:04:00.150 --> 00:04:05.669
 I would begin to think about the future 

00:04:03.079 --> 00:04:06.329
 a little something should be changed because 

00:04:05.669 --> 00:04:08.159
 this team 

00:04:06.329 --> 00:04:09.989
 in a year he did not take half a step 

00:04:08.159 --> 00:04:12.569
 forward that there is no justification 

00:04:09.989 --> 00:04:15.090
 this is why what we saw yesterday is 

00:04:12.569 --> 00:04:19.049
 was really disarming 

00:04:15.090 --> 00:04:21.450
 so it is the third year that we endure 

00:04:19.049 --> 00:04:23.130
 I'm not nobody asks to win it 

00:04:21.450 --> 00:04:24.120
 Scudetto to win the Europa League and the 

00:04:23.130 --> 00:04:27.410
 champion cup 

00:04:24.120 --> 00:04:30.270
 in an amen, however, the fans want to see 

00:04:27.410 --> 00:04:32.220
 a step forward and malice on the pitch 

00:04:30.270 --> 00:04:35.120
 because there is no evil in the field 

00:04:32.220 --> 00:04:35.120
 justification that it holds
