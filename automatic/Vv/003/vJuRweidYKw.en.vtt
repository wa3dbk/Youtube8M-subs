00:00:09.940 --> 00:00:14.800
 home samsung this product like 

00:00:13.060 --> 00:00:17.800
 says the name itself is an ultrabook 

00:00:14.800 --> 00:00:19.749
 then the new notebooks based on the 

00:00:17.800 --> 00:00:22.509
 intel processor technology 

00:00:19.749 --> 00:00:24.789
 the new series 5 ultrà is the first 

00:00:22.509 --> 00:00:26.829
 ultrabook launched by samsung here lo 

00:00:24.789 --> 00:00:30.699
 we see in the 13 inch version 

00:00:26.829 --> 00:00:33.700
 we will then launch in the second part of the 

00:00:30.699 --> 00:00:34.630
 first half a version from 14 

00:00:33.700 --> 00:00:36.100
 inch 

00:00:34.630 --> 00:00:38.260
 the difference between the two obviously a 

00:00:36.100 --> 00:00:41.080
 part of the pollicia of the screen already 

00:00:38.260 --> 00:00:43.330
 in the fact that the 14-inch mounts too 

00:00:41.080 --> 00:00:45.500
 an optic an optical disc then the 

00:00:43.330 --> 00:00:48.620
 possibility of seeing DVDs 

00:00:45.500 --> 00:00:50.150
 directly on our pc and will have 

00:00:48.620 --> 00:00:51.200
 the possibility of mounting a card 

00:00:50.150 --> 00:00:55.160
 dedicated graphics 

00:00:51.200 --> 00:00:57.260
 plus the 14 inch version will also have 

00:00:55.160 --> 00:00:59.900
 the professional operating system 

00:00:57.260 --> 00:01:01.640
 we now see the 5 ultrà series in 

00:00:59.900 --> 00:01:04.100
 version 13 that the first one we launch 

00:01:01.640 --> 00:01:08.420
 how we see a very thin product 

00:01:04.100 --> 00:01:11.660
 very light weighs only 1.4 kg all 

00:01:08.420 --> 00:01:12.950
 made of aluminum and fiberglass 

00:01:11.660 --> 00:01:14.869
 this is a very important thing 

00:01:12.950 --> 00:01:16.460
 because the resistance to the product but 

00:01:14.869 --> 00:01:19.940
 also an extreme flexibility to the 

00:01:16.460 --> 00:01:22.340
 chassis against a possible impact then 

00:01:19.940 --> 00:01:24.440
 the upper part of the cover is 

00:01:22.340 --> 00:01:29.390
 made of aluminum as the part 

00:01:24.440 --> 00:01:31.940
 inside of the chassis the part 

00:01:29.390 --> 00:01:35.289
 instead it is in fiberglass 

00:01:31.940 --> 00:01:37.490
 obviously colored in the same color 

00:01:35.289 --> 00:01:40.009
 let's see the features of 

00:01:37.490 --> 00:01:41.930
 this product a very large touchpad 

00:01:40.009 --> 00:01:44.030
 this is an important thing because 

00:01:41.930 --> 00:01:46.100
 however if we have to use them on the move 

00:01:44.030 --> 00:01:48.110
 allows us to interact with the 

00:01:46.100 --> 00:01:51.140
 machine very effectively 

00:01:48.110 --> 00:01:53.030
 u2 the two mouse buttons 

00:01:51.140 --> 00:01:54.530
 as for the doors 

00:01:53.030 --> 00:01:56.540
 very important feature of 

00:01:54.530 --> 00:01:58.909
 this ultrabook we have connectivity 

00:01:56.540 --> 00:02:02.090
 less bad than a standard notebook then 

00:01:58.909 --> 00:02:04.340
 we have a sb in this position a 

00:02:02.090 --> 00:02:07.520

00:02:04.340 --> 00:02:10.130
 micro charges at the vga input with 

00:02:07.520 --> 00:02:12.650
 adapter for microphone input e 

00:02:10.130 --> 00:02:17.709
 headphone is very important on this side 

00:02:12.650 --> 00:02:21.200
 we also have the LAN network input 

00:02:17.709 --> 00:02:23.150
 let's move to the other side of the product 

00:02:21.200 --> 00:02:25.820

00:02:23.150 --> 00:02:27.709
