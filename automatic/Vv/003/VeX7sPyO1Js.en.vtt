to<00:04:58.840> jump<00:04:59.020> this<00:04:59.320> turn<00:04:59.560> so<00:05:00.130> I'm<00:05:00.550> going<00:05:00.790> to<00:05:00.820> go

00:05:00.930 --> 00:05:00.940 
to jump this turn so I'm going to go

00:05:00.940 --> 00:05:02.760 
to jump this turn so I'm going to go
ahead<00:05:01.030> and<00:05:01.180> play<00:05:01.480> a<00:05:01.510> card<00:05:01.810> and<00:05:02.350> you<00:05:02.440> can't<00:05:02.650> plan

00:05:02.760 --> 00:05:02.770
