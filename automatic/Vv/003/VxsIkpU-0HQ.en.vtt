00:00:01.949 --> 00:00:09.130
 both children pay attention to all 

00:00:05.680 --> 00:00:12.309
 together we go hiking where 

00:00:09.130 --> 00:00:19.539
 taught please to guess mystery 

00:00:12.309 --> 00:00:22.150
 diviner I'm just bored with keys and 

00:00:19.539 --> 00:00:30.240
 grandchildren vertebrate mammals do not 

00:00:22.150 --> 00:00:30.240
 move are of handrails is 

00:00:31.320 --> 00:00:38.500
 extraordinary we go hiking with 

00:00:35.890 --> 00:00:43.210
 amazing samba tour in the museum 

00:00:38.500 --> 00:00:46.750
 of natural sciences today the austro and 

00:00:43.210 --> 00:00:49.690
 this children is the but of austro machine 

00:00:46.750 --> 00:00:53.250
 I am a flying reptile that lived 

00:00:49.690 --> 00:00:56.580
 Early Cretaceous 

00:00:53.250 --> 00:01:00.770
 very well children now follow me here not 

00:00:56.580 --> 00:01:00.770
 separate all together 

00:01:04.269 --> 00:01:07.109
 king 

00:01:12.290 --> 00:01:20.760
 Florentine Ameghino paleontologist 

00:01:15.300 --> 00:01:24.090
 Argentine pointer crisis of austro samba 

00:01:20.760 --> 00:01:29.060
 a flying dinosaur with a very sharp beak 

00:01:24.090 --> 00:01:32.310
 strange by the way is not anything important 

00:01:29.060 --> 00:01:35.400
 it's a master bone that I've placed in 

00:01:32.310 --> 00:01:39.770
 any dinosaur makes you copper 

00:01:35.400 --> 00:01:44.700
 life for about two minutes 

00:01:39.770 --> 00:01:47.509
 exactly minute from 

00:01:44.700 --> 00:01:47.509
 From now 

00:01:54.150 --> 00:02:03.000
 where he went to the clearing that zampa flew 

00:01:59.310 --> 00:02:05.940
 for something but austere means wing of 

00:02:03.000 --> 00:02:08.990
 South is unique among reptiles by the 

00:02:05.940 --> 00:02:08.990
 shape of its beak 

00:02:11.840 --> 00:02:19.780
 amber pink these reptiles are not 

00:02:15.270 --> 00:02:21.660
 carnivores I do not think they're going to eat us 

00:02:19.780 --> 00:02:25.560
 all right 

00:02:21.660 --> 00:02:27.840
 they were pink so it looks like 

00:02:25.560 --> 00:02:29.790
 that the flamingos he terol to another one 

00:02:27.840 --> 00:02:32.490
 fed from small organisms that 

00:02:29.790 --> 00:02:34.920
 they lived in the water and that's why they had this 

00:02:32.490 --> 00:02:38.420
 skin color they had also developed 

00:02:34.920 --> 00:02:42.989
 a very particular system to eat 

00:02:38.420 --> 00:02:45.710
 let's see it to the load my brave 

00:02:42.989 --> 00:02:47.069
 to 

00:02:45.710 --> 00:02:49.590
 and so much 

00:02:47.069 --> 00:02:52.139
 just like whales used their 

00:02:49.590 --> 00:02:55.849
 teeth to filter the water and so the 

00:02:52.139 --> 00:02:55.849
 food was between his teeth 

00:02:58.340 --> 00:03:01.340
 all right 

00:03:02.540 --> 00:03:06.350
 as an inhibitor 

00:03:12.360 --> 00:03:17.770
 it is not yet known what caused its extinction 

00:03:15.190 --> 00:03:20.890
 but it was long before the fall of 

00:03:17.770 --> 00:03:22.990
 meteorite meteorite makes many millions 

00:03:20.890 --> 00:03:24.930
 of years they believe that the earth was 

00:03:22.990 --> 00:03:28.780
 bombed by asteroids and meteorites 

00:03:24.930 --> 00:03:32.440
 and a very large one fell in america 

00:03:28.780 --> 00:03:35.650
 north that caused earthquakes eruptions 

00:03:32.440 --> 00:03:39.520
 of volcanoes and a large cloud of ash 

00:03:35.650 --> 00:03:42.040
 smoke and dust plants without sunlight 

00:03:39.520 --> 00:03:44.530
 they were dying and the animals that were 

00:03:42.040 --> 00:03:47.350
 they fed on them also because they did not 

00:03:44.530 --> 00:03:49.990
 they had food like that the herbivores that 

00:03:47.350 --> 00:03:51.850
 they ate plants they ran out of food and 

00:03:49.990 --> 00:03:55.380
 the carnivores that ate the 

00:03:51.850 --> 00:03:58.380
 herbivores also then it 

00:03:55.380 --> 00:03:58.380
 they extinguished 

00:03:59.880 --> 00:04:06.370
 good child again paleontology 

00:04:03.790 --> 00:04:08.730
 It has helped us to know a little more 

00:04:06.370 --> 00:04:11.880
 about how life was on earth 

00:04:08.730 --> 00:04:15.040
 before the existence of man 

00:04:11.880 --> 00:04:18.280
 dinosaurs mean terrible reptile 

00:04:15.040 --> 00:04:23.190
 but now we know that not everyone was so 

00:04:18.280 --> 00:04:23.190
 terrible different truth 

00:04:24.330 --> 00:04:28.460
 the amazing standard world
