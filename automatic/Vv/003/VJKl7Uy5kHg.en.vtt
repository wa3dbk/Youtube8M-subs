hello everybody welcome back to the mind
of<00:00:10.460> watercolor<00:00:10.940> just<00:00:11.750> thought<00:00:11.960> I<00:00:11.990> would<00:00:12.170> do<00:00:12.440> a

00:00:12.459 --> 00:00:12.469 
of watercolor just thought I would do a

00:00:12.469 --> 00:00:15.879 
of watercolor just thought I would do a
quick<00:00:12.830> support<00:00:13.759> video<00:00:14.150> today<00:00:14.599> for<00:00:14.660> the<00:00:15.650> bare

tree<00:00:16.610> limb<00:00:17.619> general<00:00:18.619> sketching<00:00:19.189> I<00:00:19.310> did<00:00:19.610> just

00:00:20.380 --> 00:00:20.390 
tree limb general sketching I did just

00:00:20.390 --> 00:00:23.409 
tree limb general sketching I did just
look<00:00:20.570> up<00:00:20.720> the<00:00:20.750> top<00:00:21.169> here<00:00:21.560> and<00:00:21.820> I'll<00:00:22.820> put<00:00:23.090> a<00:00:23.119> link

00:00:23.409 --> 00:00:23.419 
look up the top here and I'll put a link

00:00:23.419 --> 00:00:26.620 
look up the top here and I'll put a link
basically<00:00:24.259> I<00:00:24.590> was<00:00:24.980> just<00:00:25.390> sketching<00:00:26.390> in<00:00:26.509> my

00:00:26.620 --> 00:00:26.630 
basically I was just sketching in my

00:00:26.630 --> 00:00:29.920 
basically I was just sketching in my
journal<00:00:27.050> a<00:00:27.169> bear<00:00:27.829> limbed<00:00:28.489> kind<00:00:29.000> of<00:00:29.090> oak<00:00:29.329> tree

00:00:29.920 --> 00:00:29.930 
journal a bear limbed kind of oak tree

00:00:29.930 --> 00:00:32.830 
journal a bear limbed kind of oak tree
and<00:00:30.230> in<00:00:30.619> that<00:00:30.800> video<00:00:30.919> I<00:00:31.460> mentioned<00:00:31.599> the<00:00:32.599> way<00:00:32.780> to

00:00:32.830 --> 00:00:32.840 
and in that video I mentioned the way to

00:00:32.840 --> 00:00:34.840 
and in that video I mentioned the way to
get<00:00:33.140> better<00:00:33.500> trees<00:00:33.950> and<00:00:34.310> more<00:00:34.490> realistic

00:00:34.840 --> 00:00:34.850 
get better trees and more realistic

00:00:34.850 --> 00:00:39.430 
get better trees and more realistic
limbs<00:00:35.390> on<00:00:35.660> trees<00:00:36.340> was<00:00:37.340> to<00:00:38.240> be<00:00:38.480> careful<00:00:39.140> of<00:00:39.230> your

00:00:39.430 --> 00:00:39.440 
limbs on trees was to be careful of your

00:00:39.440 --> 00:00:41.980 
limbs on trees was to be careful of your
foreshortening<00:00:40.280> tendencies<00:00:41.210> to<00:00:41.390> draw<00:00:41.660> limbs

00:00:41.980 --> 00:00:41.990 
foreshortening tendencies to draw limbs

00:00:41.990 --> 00:00:44.020 
foreshortening tendencies to draw limbs
out<00:00:42.440> to<00:00:42.740> the<00:00:42.830> side<00:00:43.100> there's<00:00:43.610> nothing<00:00:43.850> wrong

00:00:44.020 --> 00:00:44.030 
out to the side there's nothing wrong

00:00:44.030 --> 00:00:46.390 
out to the side there's nothing wrong
with<00:00:44.090> that<00:00:44.330> because<00:00:45.260> a<00:00:45.290> lot<00:00:45.740> of<00:00:45.770> the<00:00:45.950> branches

00:00:46.390 --> 00:00:46.400 
with that because a lot of the branches

00:00:46.400 --> 00:00:49.510 
with that because a lot of the branches
you<00:00:46.579> see<00:00:46.930> they<00:00:47.930> will<00:00:48.200> go<00:00:48.440> out<00:00:48.620> to<00:00:48.800> the<00:00:48.890> side<00:00:49.160> if

00:00:49.510 --> 00:00:49.520 
you see they will go out to the side if

00:00:49.520 --> 00:00:52.450 
you see they will go out to the side if
you<00:00:49.610> want<00:00:49.850> to<00:00:49.970> improve<00:00:50.360> your<00:00:50.900> trees<00:00:51.410> and<00:00:51.950> add

00:00:52.450 --> 00:00:52.460 
you want to improve your trees and add

00:00:52.460 --> 00:00:54.670 
you want to improve your trees and add
some<00:00:52.760> realism<00:00:53.300> the<00:00:53.930> first<00:00:54.200> thing<00:00:54.380> you<00:00:54.500> need<00:00:54.620> to

00:00:54.670 --> 00:00:54.680 
some realism the first thing you need to

00:00:54.680 --> 00:00:57.010 
some realism the first thing you need to
do<00:00:54.920> is<00:00:55.160> just<00:00:55.370> be<00:00:55.579> very<00:00:55.730> observant<00:00:55.970> and<00:00:56.630> a<00:00:56.840> lot

00:00:57.010 --> 00:00:57.020 
do is just be very observant and a lot

00:00:57.020 --> 00:00:58.960 
do is just be very observant and a lot
of<00:00:57.140> time<00:00:57.320> just<00:00:57.350> looking<00:00:57.800> but<00:00:58.400> second<00:00:58.760> of<00:00:58.820> all

00:00:58.960 --> 00:00:58.970 
of time just looking but second of all

00:00:58.970 --> 00:01:01.540 
of time just looking but second of all
and<00:00:59.420> I<00:00:59.870> mentioned<00:01:00.260> this<00:01:00.380> in<00:01:00.560> that<00:01:00.710> video<00:01:00.920> pay

00:01:01.540 --> 00:01:01.550 
and I mentioned this in that video pay

00:01:01.550 --> 00:01:03.880 
and I mentioned this in that video pay
attention<00:01:02.030> to<00:01:02.149> how<00:01:02.239> the<00:01:02.440> branches<00:01:03.440> go<00:01:03.649> away

00:01:03.880 --> 00:01:03.890 
attention to how the branches go away

00:01:03.890 --> 00:01:06.969 
attention to how the branches go away
from<00:01:04.189> you<00:01:04.369> and<00:01:04.549> come<00:01:05.420> towards<00:01:05.840> you<00:01:06.200> in<00:01:06.470> art

00:01:06.969 --> 00:01:06.979 
from you and come towards you in art

00:01:06.979 --> 00:01:09.190 
from you and come towards you in art
this<00:01:07.190> is<00:01:07.400> known<00:01:07.580> as<00:01:07.610> foreshortening<00:01:08.330> in<00:01:08.990> case

00:01:09.190 --> 00:01:09.200 
this is known as foreshortening in case

00:01:09.200 --> 00:01:11.410 
this is known as foreshortening in case
you're<00:01:09.380> not<00:01:09.530> familiar<00:01:09.800> with<00:01:10.340> the<00:01:10.490> term<00:01:10.760> so<00:01:11.390> I

00:01:11.410 --> 00:01:11.420 
you're not familiar with the term so I

00:01:11.420 --> 00:01:13.719 
you're not familiar with the term so I
wanted<00:01:11.750> to<00:01:11.870> lend<00:01:12.110> a<00:01:12.380> little<00:01:12.830> more<00:01:13.040> detail<00:01:13.520> to

00:01:13.719 --> 00:01:13.729 
wanted to lend a little more detail to

00:01:13.729 --> 00:01:16.300 
wanted to lend a little more detail to
that<00:01:13.909> and<00:01:14.180> just<00:01:14.840> give<00:01:15.020> you<00:01:15.110> some<00:01:15.320> tips<00:01:15.590> on<00:01:15.950> how

00:01:16.300 --> 00:01:16.310 
that and just give you some tips on how

00:01:16.310 --> 00:01:18.670 
that and just give you some tips on how
to<00:01:16.549> do<00:01:16.820> foreshortening<00:01:17.540> better<00:01:17.750> and<00:01:18.049> I'm<00:01:18.470> just

00:01:18.670 --> 00:01:18.680 
to do foreshortening better and I'm just

00:01:18.680 --> 00:01:20.590 
to do foreshortening better and I'm just
using<00:01:18.860> a<00:01:19.100> graphite<00:01:19.490> pencil<00:01:19.549> I<00:01:20.030> know<00:01:20.090> this<00:01:20.420> is

00:01:20.590 --> 00:01:20.600 
using a graphite pencil I know this is

00:01:20.600 --> 00:01:22.780 
using a graphite pencil I know this is
more<00:01:20.990> of<00:01:21.049> a<00:01:21.110> drawing<00:01:21.409> exercise<00:01:22.040> but<00:01:22.460> drawing

00:01:22.780 --> 00:01:22.790 
more of a drawing exercise but drawing

00:01:22.790 --> 00:01:25.090 
more of a drawing exercise but drawing
is<00:01:23.000> very<00:01:23.180> important<00:01:23.600> to<00:01:23.750> watercolor<00:01:24.260> but<00:01:24.950> the

00:01:25.090 --> 00:01:25.100 
is very important to watercolor but the

00:01:25.100 --> 00:01:26.680 
is very important to watercolor but the
first<00:01:25.340> thing<00:01:25.940> you'll<00:01:26.180> notice<00:01:26.360> on

00:01:26.680 --> 00:01:26.690 
first thing you'll notice on

00:01:26.690 --> 00:01:29.289 
first thing you'll notice on
foreshortening<00:01:27.409> and<00:01:27.620> a<00:01:28.370> good<00:01:28.580> visual<00:01:28.970> clue

00:01:29.289 --> 00:01:29.299 
foreshortening and a good visual clue

00:01:29.299 --> 00:01:31.000 
foreshortening and a good visual clue
too<00:01:29.420> short<00:01:29.659> for<00:01:29.869> shortening<00:01:30.530> and<00:01:30.680> there<00:01:30.920> are

00:01:31.000 --> 00:01:31.010 
too short for shortening and there are

00:01:31.010 --> 00:01:34.149 
too short for shortening and there are
two<00:01:31.220> basically<00:01:32.180> the<00:01:32.960> first<00:01:33.110> is<00:01:33.380> overlap<00:01:33.890> and

00:01:34.149 --> 00:01:34.159 
two basically the first is overlap and

00:01:34.159 --> 00:01:36.460 
two basically the first is overlap and
the<00:01:34.220> other<00:01:34.369> is<00:01:34.549> shadow<00:01:34.850> if<00:01:35.360> a<00:01:36.020> branch<00:01:36.290> is

00:01:36.460 --> 00:01:36.470 
the other is shadow if a branch is

00:01:36.470 --> 00:01:38.260 
the other is shadow if a branch is
coming<00:01:36.830> towards<00:01:37.280> you<00:01:37.430> you're<00:01:37.880> going<00:01:38.030> to<00:01:38.090> have

00:01:38.260 --> 00:01:38.270 
coming towards you you're going to have

00:01:38.270 --> 00:01:40.930 
coming towards you you're going to have
a<00:01:38.299> spot<00:01:38.740> like<00:01:39.740> that<00:01:39.770> where<00:01:40.190> it's<00:01:40.310> coming<00:01:40.729> out

00:01:40.930 --> 00:01:40.940 
a spot like that where it's coming out

00:01:40.940 --> 00:01:43.450 
a spot like that where it's coming out
of<00:01:41.420> the<00:01:41.510> tree

00:01:43.450 --> 00:01:43.460 
of the tree

00:01:43.460 --> 00:01:46.000 
of the tree
a<00:01:43.610> lot<00:01:44.420> of<00:01:44.450> times<00:01:44.720> branches<00:01:45.229> go<00:01:45.440> up<00:01:45.650> but<00:01:45.890> they

00:01:46.000 --> 00:01:46.010 
a lot of times branches go up but they

00:01:46.010 --> 00:01:48.820 
a lot of times branches go up but they
will<00:01:46.220> change<00:01:46.250> direction<00:01:47.170> so<00:01:48.170> let's<00:01:48.380> say<00:01:48.619> this

00:01:48.820 --> 00:01:48.830 
will change direction so let's say this

00:01:48.830 --> 00:01:53.080 
will change direction so let's say this
branch<00:01:49.159> is<00:01:50.650> coming<00:01:51.650> towards<00:01:52.100> you<00:01:52.400> and<00:01:52.729> then<00:01:52.970> it

00:01:53.080 --> 00:01:53.090 
branch is coming towards you and then it

00:01:53.090 --> 00:01:57.820 
branch is coming towards you and then it
goes<00:01:53.390> down<00:01:55.119> like<00:01:56.119> that<00:01:56.420> now<00:01:56.990> how<00:01:57.530> in<00:01:57.710> the<00:01:57.740> world

00:01:57.820 --> 00:01:57.830 
goes down like that now how in the world

00:01:57.830 --> 00:01:59.800 
goes down like that now how in the world
you<00:01:58.009> make<00:01:58.250> that<00:01:58.460> branch<00:01:58.970> look<00:01:59.390> like<00:01:59.630> it's

00:01:59.800 --> 00:01:59.810 
you make that branch look like it's

00:01:59.810 --> 00:02:00.969 
you make that branch look like it's
coming<00:02:00.229> towards<00:02:00.560> you<00:02:00.650> because<00:02:00.830> you're

00:02:00.969 --> 00:02:00.979 
coming towards you because you're

00:02:00.979 --> 00:02:03.399 
coming towards you because you're
drawing<00:02:01.220> on<00:02:01.400> a<00:02:01.430> flat<00:02:01.729> surface<00:02:02.000> right<00:02:02.479> well

00:02:03.399 --> 00:02:03.409 
drawing on a flat surface right well

00:02:03.409 --> 00:02:08.340 
drawing on a flat surface right well
overlap<00:02:03.920> okay<00:02:04.550> as<00:02:04.729> it<00:02:04.909> comes<00:02:05.500> out<00:02:06.500> of<00:02:06.560> the<00:02:07.009> tree

00:02:08.340 --> 00:02:08.350 
overlap okay as it comes out of the tree

00:02:08.350 --> 00:02:11.140 
overlap okay as it comes out of the tree
you'll<00:02:09.350> notice<00:02:09.619> an<00:02:09.770> overlap<00:02:10.220> right<00:02:10.640> here

00:02:11.140 --> 00:02:11.150 
you'll notice an overlap right here

00:02:11.150 --> 00:02:13.420 
you'll notice an overlap right here
comes<00:02:11.690> down<00:02:12.110> here<00:02:12.830> and<00:02:12.920> change<00:02:13.310> this

00:02:13.420 --> 00:02:13.430 
comes down here and change this

00:02:13.430 --> 00:02:15.610 
comes down here and change this
direction<00:02:13.910> comes<00:02:14.120> this<00:02:14.300> way<00:02:14.540> we're<00:02:15.410> going<00:02:15.440> to

00:02:15.610 --> 00:02:15.620 
direction comes this way we're going to

00:02:15.620 --> 00:02:17.410 
direction comes this way we're going to
see<00:02:15.860> probably<00:02:16.100> a<00:02:16.459> little<00:02:16.640> bit<00:02:16.820> of<00:02:16.940> an<00:02:17.030> overlap

00:02:17.410 --> 00:02:17.420 
see probably a little bit of an overlap

00:02:17.420 --> 00:02:19.900 
see probably a little bit of an overlap
here<00:02:17.450> and<00:02:18.050> then<00:02:18.980> as<00:02:19.130> it<00:02:19.250> changed<00:02:19.610> directions

00:02:19.900 --> 00:02:19.910 
here and then as it changed directions

00:02:19.910 --> 00:02:23.259 
here and then as it changed directions
and<00:02:20.390> goes<00:02:20.630> up<00:02:20.900> here<00:02:21.290> you're<00:02:21.980> going<00:02:22.100> to<00:02:22.190> see<00:02:22.459> a

00:02:23.259 --> 00:02:23.269 
and goes up here you're going to see a

00:02:23.269 --> 00:02:26.140 
and goes up here you're going to see a
little<00:02:23.510> bit<00:02:23.720> of<00:02:23.780> an<00:02:23.959> overlap<00:02:24.410> there<00:02:25.090> okay<00:02:26.090> so

00:02:26.140 --> 00:02:26.150 
little bit of an overlap there okay so

00:02:26.150 --> 00:02:28.840 
little bit of an overlap there okay so
there's<00:02:26.510> your<00:02:26.600> branch<00:02:27.370> and<00:02:28.370> we'll<00:02:28.489> just<00:02:28.640> draw

00:02:28.840 --> 00:02:28.850 
there's your branch and we'll just draw

00:02:28.850 --> 00:02:34.140 
there's your branch and we'll just draw
the<00:02:28.910> trunk<00:02:29.209> down<00:02:29.540> to<00:02:30.190> give<00:02:31.190> you<00:02:31.220> some<00:02:31.519> context

00:02:34.140 --> 00:02:34.150 
the trunk down to give you some context

00:02:34.150 --> 00:02:36.449 
the trunk down to give you some context
and<00:02:34.269> it's<00:02:34.780> coming<00:02:35.110> towards<00:02:35.439> you<00:02:35.739> and<00:02:36.099> let's<00:02:36.310> go

00:02:36.449 --> 00:02:36.459 
and it's coming towards you and let's go

00:02:36.459 --> 00:02:39.059 
and it's coming towards you and let's go
back<00:02:36.489> up<00:02:36.819> here<00:02:37.060> to<00:02:37.090> my<00:02:37.299> doodle<00:02:37.659> the<00:02:38.650> general

back up here to my doodle the general
you<00:02:39.310> know<00:02:39.459> light<00:02:40.269> outdoors<00:02:41.170> comes<00:02:41.590> from<00:02:41.860> above

00:02:42.179 --> 00:02:42.189 
you know light outdoors comes from above

00:02:42.189 --> 00:02:45.110 
you know light outdoors comes from above
now<00:02:42.700> it<00:02:42.819> may<00:02:42.939> come<00:02:43.180> from<00:02:43.209> one<00:02:43.659> side<00:02:43.930> or<00:02:44.170> another

00:02:45.110 --> 00:02:45.120 
now it may come from one side or another

00:02:45.120 --> 00:02:49.800 
now it may come from one side or another
but<00:02:46.980> generally<00:02:47.980> the<00:02:48.189> the<00:02:48.519> top<00:02:48.909> of<00:02:49.209> your

00:02:49.800 --> 00:02:49.810 
but generally the the top of your

00:02:49.810 --> 00:02:51.690 
but generally the the top of your
branches<00:02:50.349> are<00:02:50.500> going<00:02:50.590> to<00:02:50.709> be<00:02:50.829> light<00:02:51.099> and<00:02:51.340> the

00:02:51.690 --> 00:02:51.700 
branches are going to be light and the

00:02:51.700 --> 00:02:53.460 
branches are going to be light and the
bottom<00:02:52.060> is<00:02:52.209> going<00:02:52.359> to<00:02:52.420> be<00:02:52.510> dark<00:02:52.840> this<00:02:53.079> is<00:02:53.260> where

00:02:53.460 --> 00:02:53.470 
bottom is going to be dark this is where

00:02:53.470 --> 00:02:56.490 
bottom is going to be dark this is where
observation<00:02:54.099> comes<00:02:54.370> in<00:02:55.319> look<00:02:56.319> at<00:02:56.470> your

00:02:56.490 --> 00:02:56.500 
observation comes in look at your

00:02:56.500 --> 00:02:58.830 
observation comes in look at your
branches<00:02:57.129> and<00:02:57.280> see<00:02:57.549> usually<00:02:58.540> you'll<00:02:58.750> see

00:02:58.830 --> 00:02:58.840 
branches and see usually you'll see

00:02:58.840 --> 00:03:01.410 
branches and see usually you'll see
maybe<00:02:59.560> a<00:02:59.739> little<00:02:59.829> third<00:03:00.579> or<00:03:00.790> a<00:03:00.849> fourth<00:03:01.120> of<00:03:01.299> the

00:03:01.410 --> 00:03:01.420 
maybe a little third or a fourth of the

00:03:01.420 --> 00:03:03.690 
maybe a little third or a fourth of the
branch<00:03:01.689> will<00:03:01.959> be<00:03:01.989> in<00:03:02.409> shadow<00:03:02.739> this<00:03:03.310> is<00:03:03.370> what

00:03:03.690 --> 00:03:03.700 
branch will be in shadow this is what

00:03:03.700 --> 00:03:05.099 
branch will be in shadow this is what
again<00:03:04.000> where<00:03:04.209> it's<00:03:04.390> very<00:03:04.540> important<00:03:05.019> to

00:03:05.099 --> 00:03:05.109 
again where it's very important to

00:03:05.109 --> 00:03:08.520 
again where it's very important to
observe<00:03:05.250> so<00:03:06.250> is<00:03:06.400> this<00:03:06.579> branch<00:03:06.940> here<00:03:07.569> starts<00:03:08.379> to

00:03:08.520 --> 00:03:08.530 
observe so is this branch here starts to

00:03:08.530 --> 00:03:13.860 
observe so is this branch here starts to
turn<00:03:08.940> up<00:03:09.940> towards<00:03:10.930> you<00:03:12.389> you're<00:03:13.389> going<00:03:13.510> to<00:03:13.599> see

00:03:13.860 --> 00:03:13.870 
turn up towards you you're going to see

00:03:13.870 --> 00:03:23.570 
turn up towards you you're going to see
less<00:03:14.319> of<00:03:14.560> the<00:03:14.680> top<00:03:14.950> and<00:03:15.280> more<00:03:15.519> of<00:03:15.730> the<00:03:15.879> bottom

00:03:23.570 --> 00:03:23.580 

00:03:23.580 --> 00:03:27.720 

and<00:03:24.580> as<00:03:25.360> it<00:03:25.540> turns<00:03:25.810> down<00:03:26.260> and<00:03:26.770> towards<00:03:27.580> you're

00:03:27.720 --> 00:03:27.730 
and as it turns down and towards you're

00:03:27.730 --> 00:03:29.610 
and as it turns down and towards you're
going<00:03:27.970> to<00:03:28.060> see<00:03:28.210> less<00:03:28.390> at<00:03:28.630> the<00:03:28.720> bottom<00:03:29.080> it's

00:03:29.610 --> 00:03:29.620 
going to see less at the bottom it's

00:03:29.620 --> 00:03:33.570 
going to see less at the bottom it's
going<00:03:29.770> to<00:03:29.860> be<00:03:29.980> lighter<00:03:30.250> and<00:03:30.690> then<00:03:32.310> as<00:03:33.310> this

00:03:33.570 --> 00:03:33.580 
going to be lighter and then as this

00:03:33.580 --> 00:03:36.090 
going to be lighter and then as this
terms<00:03:33.940> and<00:03:34.390> comes<00:03:34.960> back<00:03:35.230> towards<00:03:35.650> you<00:03:35.770> going

00:03:36.090 --> 00:03:36.100 
terms and comes back towards you going

00:03:36.100 --> 00:03:37.830 
terms and comes back towards you going
to<00:03:36.160> see<00:03:36.310> more<00:03:36.520> at<00:03:36.640> the<00:03:36.700> bottom<00:03:36.850> again<00:03:37.180> let's

00:03:37.830 --> 00:03:37.840 
to see more at the bottom again let's

00:03:37.840 --> 00:03:42.880 
to see more at the bottom again let's
say<00:03:37.960> we<00:03:38.110> have<00:03:38.230> a<00:03:38.260> branch<00:03:38.560> here

00:03:42.880 --> 00:03:42.890 

00:03:42.890 --> 00:03:45.220 

and<00:03:42.980> it's<00:03:43.550> coming<00:03:43.850> straight<00:03:44.390> at<00:03:44.600> me<00:03:44.870> now<00:03:45.170> the

00:03:45.220 --> 00:03:45.230 
and it's coming straight at me now the

00:03:45.230 --> 00:03:46.990 
and it's coming straight at me now the
way<00:03:45.500> I<00:03:45.530> drew<00:03:45.860> it<00:03:45.890> there<00:03:46.250> the<00:03:46.520> reason<00:03:46.670> I<00:03:46.819> drew

00:03:46.990 --> 00:03:47.000 
way I drew it there the reason I drew

00:03:47.000 --> 00:03:48.820 
way I drew it there the reason I drew
that<00:03:47.030> circle<00:03:47.600> is<00:03:47.720> just<00:03:47.750> so<00:03:48.319> you'll<00:03:48.500> know<00:03:48.590> it's

00:03:48.820 --> 00:03:48.830 
that circle is just so you'll know it's

00:03:48.830 --> 00:03:52.809 
that circle is just so you'll know it's
a<00:03:48.920> cylinder<00:03:49.300> but<00:03:50.300> I'm<00:03:50.450> going<00:03:50.660> to<00:03:51.610> erase<00:03:52.610> the

00:03:52.809 --> 00:03:52.819 
a cylinder but I'm going to erase the

00:03:52.819 --> 00:03:58.360 
a cylinder but I'm going to erase the
inside<00:03:53.120> of<00:03:53.240> it<00:03:53.360> that's<00:03:54.110> cylinder<00:03:56.950> this<00:03:57.950> branch

00:03:58.360 --> 00:03:58.370 
inside of it that's cylinder this branch

00:03:58.370 --> 00:04:00.130 
inside of it that's cylinder this branch
is<00:03:58.610> going<00:03:58.700> to<00:03:58.880> be<00:03:59.030> almost<00:03:59.270> completely<00:03:59.510> in

00:04:00.130 --> 00:04:00.140 
is going to be almost completely in

00:04:00.140 --> 00:04:05.660 
is going to be almost completely in
shadow<00:04:00.490> as<00:04:01.490> you're<00:04:01.700> seeing<00:04:02.000> only<00:04:02.240> the<00:04:02.420> bottom

00:04:05.660 --> 00:04:05.670 

00:04:05.670 --> 00:04:07.050 

let's<00:04:06.120> say<00:04:06.270> there's<00:04:06.450> a<00:04:06.510> branch<00:04:06.780> on

00:04:07.050 --> 00:04:07.060 
let's say there's a branch on

00:04:07.060 --> 00:04:08.490 
let's say there's a branch on
the<00:04:07.120> other<00:04:07.270> side<00:04:07.540> of<00:04:07.660> the<00:04:07.750> tree<00:04:07.959> going<00:04:08.170> away

00:04:08.490 --> 00:04:08.500 
the other side of the tree going away

00:04:08.500 --> 00:04:12.550 
the other side of the tree going away
from<00:04:08.800> you

00:04:12.550 --> 00:04:12.560 

00:04:12.560 --> 00:04:14.530 

if<00:04:12.980> the<00:04:13.130> lights<00:04:13.340> nearly<00:04:13.850> directly<00:04:14.270> overhead

00:04:14.530 --> 00:04:14.540 
if the lights nearly directly overhead

00:04:14.540 --> 00:04:16.960 
if the lights nearly directly overhead
you're<00:04:15.530> going<00:04:15.680> to<00:04:15.740> see<00:04:15.920> almost<00:04:16.100> no<00:04:16.400> shadow<00:04:16.730> at

00:04:16.960 --> 00:04:16.970 
you're going to see almost no shadow at

00:04:16.970 --> 00:04:19.979 
you're going to see almost no shadow at
all<00:04:17.709> because<00:04:18.709> you're<00:04:19.010> only<00:04:19.160> seeing<00:04:19.400> the<00:04:19.579> top

00:04:19.979 --> 00:04:19.989 
all because you're only seeing the top

00:04:19.989 --> 00:04:22.240 
all because you're only seeing the top
but<00:04:20.989> these<00:04:21.139> are<00:04:21.320> the<00:04:21.410> kind<00:04:21.590> of<00:04:21.680> clues<00:04:21.889> you<00:04:22.070> need

00:04:22.240 --> 00:04:22.250 
but these are the kind of clues you need

00:04:22.250 --> 00:04:26.020 
but these are the kind of clues you need
to<00:04:22.370> look<00:04:22.520> for<00:04:22.810> you<00:04:23.810> can<00:04:23.840> draw<00:04:24.380> anything<00:04:25.030> or

00:04:26.020 --> 00:04:26.030 
to look for you can draw anything or

00:04:26.030 --> 00:04:35.200 
to look for you can draw anything or
shortened<00:04:26.800> by<00:04:27.800> drawing<00:04:28.610> it<00:04:28.820> like<00:04:28.850> a<00:04:29.270> hose

00:04:35.200 --> 00:04:35.210 

00:04:35.210 --> 00:04:38.140 

you

00:04:38.140 --> 00:04:38.150 

00:04:38.150 --> 00:04:45.360 

see<00:04:38.750> how<00:04:38.900> that<00:04:38.960> appears<00:04:40.300> to<00:04:41.300> come<00:04:41.540> towards<00:04:42.050> you

00:04:45.360 --> 00:04:45.370 

00:04:45.370 --> 00:04:49.710 

as<00:04:45.940> I<00:04:46.090> define<00:04:46.510> the<00:04:47.290> shape<00:04:47.620> and<00:04:48.600> where<00:04:49.600> it

00:04:49.710 --> 00:04:49.720 
as I define the shape and where it

00:04:49.720 --> 00:04:52.050 
as I define the shape and where it
changes<00:04:50.169> direction<00:04:50.740> you<00:04:51.130> can<00:04:51.550> apply<00:04:51.850> a<00:04:51.880> little

00:04:52.050 --> 00:04:52.060 
changes direction you can apply a little

00:04:52.060 --> 00:04:56.820 
changes direction you can apply a little
of<00:04:52.240> the<00:04:52.300> overlap<00:04:53.430> and<00:04:54.600> there<00:04:55.600> you<00:04:55.720> have<00:04:55.750> it<00:04:55.930> all

00:04:56.820 --> 00:04:56.830 
of the overlap and there you have it all

00:04:56.830 --> 00:04:59.010 
of the overlap and there you have it all
I've<00:04:57.130> done<00:04:57.370> is<00:04:57.699> break<00:04:58.240> this<00:04:58.419> down<00:04:58.630> into<00:04:58.990> a

00:04:59.010 --> 00:04:59.020 
I've done is break this down into a

00:04:59.020 --> 00:05:02.460 
I've done is break this down into a
series<00:04:59.320> of<00:04:59.500> cylinders<00:05:00.960> get<00:05:01.960> you<00:05:02.110> thinking

00:05:02.460 --> 00:05:02.470 
series of cylinders get you thinking

00:05:02.470 --> 00:05:07.020 
series of cylinders get you thinking
about<00:05:03.840> these<00:05:04.840> branches<00:05:05.710> coming<00:05:06.490> towards<00:05:06.940> you

00:05:07.020 --> 00:05:07.030 
about these branches coming towards you

00:05:07.030 --> 00:05:10.320 
about these branches coming towards you
as<00:05:07.150> a<00:05:07.180> cylinder

00:05:10.320 --> 00:05:10.330 

00:05:10.330 --> 00:05:19.070 

breakdown<00:05:11.330> any<00:05:11.569> branch

00:05:19.070 --> 00:05:19.080 

00:05:19.080 --> 00:05:21.870 

you

00:05:21.870 --> 00:05:21.880 

00:05:21.880 --> 00:05:23.940 

when<00:05:22.390> you<00:05:22.480> don't<00:05:22.660> have<00:05:22.750> to<00:05:22.930> do<00:05:23.110> this<00:05:23.350> obviously

00:05:23.940 --> 00:05:23.950 
when you don't have to do this obviously

00:05:23.950 --> 00:05:27.000 
when you don't have to do this obviously
before<00:05:24.190> every<00:05:24.780> branch<00:05:25.780> that<00:05:26.080> you<00:05:26.140> draw<00:05:26.530> but

00:05:27.000 --> 00:05:27.010 
before every branch that you draw but

00:05:27.010 --> 00:05:29.370 
before every branch that you draw but
just<00:05:27.880> want<00:05:28.060> to<00:05:28.120> start<00:05:28.330> thinking<00:05:28.690> about<00:05:28.870> it<00:05:29.230> as

00:05:29.370 --> 00:05:29.380 
just want to start thinking about it as

00:05:29.380 --> 00:05:34.970 
just want to start thinking about it as
cylinders<00:05:30.010> that<00:05:30.850> are<00:05:30.970> coming<00:05:31.300> towards<00:05:31.660> you

00:05:34.970 --> 00:05:34.980 

00:05:34.980 --> 00:05:39.530 

bottom<00:05:35.370> you<00:05:35.580> see<00:05:36.200> more<00:05:37.200> shadow<00:05:38.180> you'll<00:05:39.180> see

00:05:39.530 --> 00:05:39.540 
bottom you see more shadow you'll see

00:05:39.540 --> 00:05:42.320 
bottom you see more shadow you'll see
more<00:05:40.410> of<00:05:40.530> the<00:05:40.620> top<00:05:40.860> you<00:05:41.130> see<00:05:41.370> like<00:05:41.850> these<00:05:42.120> three

00:05:42.320 --> 00:05:42.330 
more of the top you see like these three

00:05:42.330 --> 00:05:47.720 
more of the top you see like these three
sections<00:05:42.810> the<00:05:43.550> lighter<00:05:44.550> will<00:05:44.850> be<00:05:45.890> then<00:05:46.890> if<00:05:47.460> you

00:05:47.720 --> 00:05:47.730 
sections the lighter will be then if you

00:05:47.730 --> 00:05:51.570 
sections the lighter will be then if you
get<00:05:47.880> down<00:05:48.090> to<00:05:48.270> the<00:05:48.420> end

00:05:51.570 --> 00:05:51.580 

00:05:51.580 --> 00:05:58.290 

one<00:05:52.509> curves<00:05:52.840> comes<00:05:53.830> back<00:05:54.129> up

00:05:58.290 --> 00:05:58.300 

00:05:58.300 --> 00:06:02.839 

we'll<00:05:58.750> see<00:05:58.960> more<00:05:59.169> shadow<00:05:59.470> yeah

00:06:02.839 --> 00:06:02.849 

00:06:02.849 --> 00:06:05.209 

and<00:06:02.939> these<00:06:03.569> cylinders<00:06:04.020> they<00:06:04.830> help<00:06:05.069> you

00:06:05.209 --> 00:06:05.219 
and these cylinders they help you

00:06:05.219 --> 00:06:07.899 
and these cylinders they help you
visualize<00:06:05.459> where<00:06:06.059> they<00:06:06.179> at<00:06:06.360> the<00:06:06.569> overlaps<00:06:07.050> go

00:06:07.899 --> 00:06:07.909 
visualize where they at the overlaps go

00:06:07.909 --> 00:06:11.449 
visualize where they at the overlaps go
so<00:06:08.909> I<00:06:08.939> hope<00:06:09.149> that<00:06:09.209> helps<00:06:09.839> clarify<00:06:10.110> it<00:06:10.459> two

00:06:11.449 --> 00:06:11.459 
so I hope that helps clarify it two

00:06:11.459 --> 00:06:17.360 
so I hope that helps clarify it two
basic<00:06:11.909> things<00:06:12.179> overlap<00:06:13.080> and<00:06:14.029> shadow

00:06:17.360 --> 00:06:17.370 

00:06:17.370 --> 00:06:18.920 

that<00:06:17.610> needs<00:06:17.820> to<00:06:18.030> be<00:06:18.120> informed<00:06:18.660> by<00:06:18.900> your

00:06:18.920 --> 00:06:18.930 
that needs to be informed by your

00:06:18.930 --> 00:06:20.629 
that needs to be informed by your
observation<00:06:19.800> and<00:06:19.979> that's<00:06:20.160> the<00:06:20.430> key<00:06:20.610> thing

00:06:20.629 --> 00:06:20.639 
observation and that's the key thing

00:06:20.639 --> 00:06:22.730 
observation and that's the key thing
yeah<00:06:21.090> I<00:06:21.210> don't<00:06:21.570> want<00:06:21.720> you<00:06:21.870> to<00:06:21.990> think<00:06:22.440> of<00:06:22.590> these

00:06:22.730 --> 00:06:22.740 
yeah I don't want you to think of these

00:06:22.740 --> 00:06:26.450 
yeah I don't want you to think of these
as<00:06:22.770> rules<00:06:24.350> when<00:06:25.350> you<00:06:25.470> go<00:06:25.590> draw<00:06:25.949> a<00:06:25.979> branch<00:06:26.280> I

00:06:26.450 --> 00:06:26.460 
as rules when you go draw a branch I

00:06:26.460 --> 00:06:28.490 
as rules when you go draw a branch I
want<00:06:26.669> you<00:06:26.760> to<00:06:26.850> go<00:06:27.000> out<00:06:27.180> and<00:06:27.389> look<00:06:27.600> at<00:06:27.810> branches

00:06:28.490 --> 00:06:28.500 
want you to go out and look at branches

00:06:28.500 --> 00:06:31.150 
want you to go out and look at branches
and<00:06:28.710> observe<00:06:29.190> those<00:06:29.490> things<00:06:29.820> and<00:06:30.150> how<00:06:30.419> you<00:06:30.479> can

00:06:31.150 --> 00:06:31.160 
and observe those things and how you can

00:06:31.160 --> 00:06:33.680 
and observe those things and how you can
take<00:06:32.160> those<00:06:32.460> clues<00:06:32.760> away<00:06:33.090> from<00:06:33.330> the<00:06:33.449> things

00:06:33.680 --> 00:06:33.690 
take those clues away from the things

00:06:33.690 --> 00:06:38.090 
take those clues away from the things
you<00:06:33.810> actually<00:06:34.020> observe<00:06:34.620> and<00:06:34.919> apply<00:06:35.220> it<00:06:36.380> and<00:06:37.380> it

00:06:38.090 --> 00:06:38.100 
you actually observe and apply it and it

00:06:38.100 --> 00:06:40.070 
you actually observe and apply it and it
will<00:06:38.310> really<00:06:38.610> improve<00:06:38.729> the<00:06:39.570> way<00:06:39.720> you<00:06:39.780> draw

00:06:40.070 --> 00:06:40.080 
will really improve the way you draw

00:06:40.080 --> 00:06:41.930 
will really improve the way you draw
trees<00:06:40.410> especially<00:06:40.560> the<00:06:41.130> limb<00:06:41.340> parts<00:06:41.669> of<00:06:41.850> the

00:06:41.930 --> 00:06:41.940 
trees especially the limb parts of the

00:06:41.940 --> 00:06:43.640 
trees especially the limb parts of the
