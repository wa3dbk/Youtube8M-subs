00:00:13.460 --> 00:00:18.400
Today I will be making arugula and melon salad.

00:00:19.020 --> 00:00:25.160
This beautiful looking salad is great for summer days.

00:00:25.760 --> 00:00:34.300
Arugula leaves has a pepperish flavor mixed with juicy melons

00:00:34.580 --> 00:00:40.560
and topped with yogurt dressing makes a very refreshing salad.

00:00:41.140 --> 00:00:45.420
Or also can be served as a healthy snack.

00:00:46.140 --> 00:00:48.840
This recipe will serve 2.

00:00:49.480 --> 00:00:51.531
For this recipe we need:

00:00:52.160 --> 00:00:55.960
2 cups of arugula, roughly chopped.

00:00:56.180 --> 00:00:59.820
You can substitute arugula with spinach leaves.

00:01:00.560 --> 00:01:04.400
2 cups of melon, thinly sliced.

00:01:04.400 --> 00:01:07.240
I decide to use 2 different melons

00:01:07.240 --> 00:01:10.040
to give a nice color to salad.

00:01:11.180 --> 00:01:14.880
3 strawberries cut into 4 pieces.

00:01:15.620 --> 00:01:17.680
For dressing we need

00:01:17.740 --> 00:01:20.280
3 tablespoons of yogurt

00:01:20.720 --> 00:01:24.220
1 tablespoon of ginger juice

00:01:24.780 --> 00:01:26.700
1/8 teaspoon of salt

00:01:27.520 --> 00:01:28.980
Pinch of black pepper

00:01:29.520 --> 00:01:32.400
1 tablespoon of honey

00:01:32.760 --> 00:01:37.560
About 1/4 cup of freshly squeezed orange juice.

00:01:37.720 --> 00:01:41.000
This is a easy recipe to make.

00:01:41.200 --> 00:01:45.980
Arugula and melon salad should be served chilled.

00:01:46.490 --> 00:01:50.620
Melon slices, you should refrigerate at least

00:01:50.620 --> 00:01:53.800
for 1 hour before serving the salad.

00:01:54.400 --> 00:01:59.520
Yogurt dressing can be prepared one day in advance.

00:02:00.180 --> 00:02:02.960
First I will make the dressing.

00:02:04.300 --> 00:02:09.920
Keep the yogurt in a strainer for at least 15 minutes.

00:02:10.260 --> 00:02:13.220
So all the extra water is squeezed.

00:02:13.440 --> 00:02:16.860
As you see this has been sitting for about 15 minutes.

00:02:17.100 --> 00:02:18.880
And so much water has come out.

00:02:19.180 --> 00:02:21.060
And now yogurt is thick.

00:02:21.540 --> 00:02:24.780
So just going to put the yogurt here.

00:02:27.880 --> 00:02:28.700
Salt

00:02:30.680 --> 00:02:31.640
Honey

00:02:37.880 --> 00:02:39.360
And ginger juice.

00:02:39.620 --> 00:02:44.600
I have already shredded the ginger using the zester.

00:02:45.100 --> 00:02:47.080
So just going to pick this up.

00:02:48.420 --> 00:02:50.320
And squeeze it right in here.

00:02:51.680 --> 00:02:53.740
It’s about 1 tablespoon.

00:02:54.840 --> 00:02:55.860
Mix it well.

00:03:05.280 --> 00:03:07.500
Mix it well so it is smooth.

00:03:08.420 --> 00:03:09.400
It’s looking good.

00:03:10.700 --> 00:03:14.300
And now I am going to squeeze the orange.

00:03:28.060 --> 00:03:33.360
And dressing should be pourable consistency.

00:03:34.740 --> 00:03:37.720
I think I need little bit more orange juice.

00:03:48.420 --> 00:03:52.140
This dressing you can make one day

00:03:52.140 --> 00:03:54.500
in advance, not more than that.

00:03:57.460 --> 00:04:01.360
And you can use this dressing for any kind of fruit salad.

00:04:02.800 --> 00:04:04.170
This looks great.

00:04:04.360 --> 00:04:06.800
Now I am ready to prepare the salad.

00:04:07.960 --> 00:04:12.380
So first I will add the arugula in the salad bowl.

Arugula and melon salad is looking very colorful and refreshing.

00:04:57.580 --> 00:05:02.760
I was inspired for this salad while we were on Alaska cruise.

00:05:03.100 --> 00:05:10.260
Adding the yogurt dressing makes it very creamy and tangy texture.

00:05:11.100 --> 00:05:13.440
This can brighten up any meal.
