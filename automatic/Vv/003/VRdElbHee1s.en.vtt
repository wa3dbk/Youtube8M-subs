00:00:16.939 --> 00:00:22.439
 hi musicophiles here we are again 

00:00:19.890 --> 00:00:24.179
 video on the pentatonic in this video 

00:00:22.439 --> 00:00:26.339
 practicing we resume more or less the 

00:00:24.179 --> 00:00:28.740
 concept applied in the previous with lo 

00:00:26.339 --> 00:00:30.900
 development on the pentatonics on 

00:00:28.740 --> 00:00:32.790
 development of triplets as cells 

00:00:30.900 --> 00:00:34.289
 therefore also melodic rhythms 

00:00:32.790 --> 00:00:36.059
 developing it vertically and 

00:00:34.289 --> 00:00:38.789
 horizontal in this new video instead 

00:00:36.059 --> 00:00:40.489
 we will develop the quatrains ok so 

00:00:38.789 --> 00:00:44.010
 practically always starting from a 

00:00:40.489 --> 00:00:47.340
 pentatonic king familiar for convenience 

00:00:44.010 --> 00:00:51.649
 let's start from the first bayern rate e 

00:00:47.340 --> 00:00:51.649
 We develop the quatrains so melodi 

00:01:05.479 --> 00:01:16.070
 obviously always on all the boxes and also 

00:01:14.070 --> 00:01:20.450
 more speed than the metronome 

00:01:16.070 --> 00:01:20.450
 also therefore horizontally 

00:01:28.280 --> 00:01:33.159
 as anticipated now also therefore 

00:01:30.560 --> 00:01:33.159
 reverse 

00:01:38.290 --> 00:01:40.830
 well 

00:01:50.250 --> 00:01:54.050
 and also obviously crossed 

00:02:06.530 --> 00:02:08.979
 was 

00:02:12.180 --> 00:02:15.930
 obviously private example all the 

00:02:14.010 --> 00:02:19.099
 box and crossed inverse then starting 

00:02:15.930 --> 00:02:19.099
 to the inverse quatrain 

00:02:26.880 --> 00:02:30.440
 obviously also in horizontal 

00:02:34.530 --> 00:02:38.810
 also 

00:02:36.630 --> 00:02:38.810
 2 

00:02:39.310 --> 00:02:43.090
 reverse horizontal crossover 

00:02:51.980 --> 00:02:55.920
 recommend applicable on all boxes in 

00:02:54.390 --> 00:02:59.750
 horizontal in all vertical 

00:02:55.920 --> 00:02:59.750
 sauces as best you can have fun 

00:03:08.200 --> 00:03:10.200
 is
