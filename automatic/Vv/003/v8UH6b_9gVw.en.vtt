it's<00:04:41.810> fourteen<00:04:42.199> fifteen<00:04:42.560> dollars<00:04:42.949> so<00:04:43.720> it

00:04:44.710 --> 00:04:44.720 
it's fourteen fifteen dollars so it

00:04:44.720 --> 00:04:46.360 
it's fourteen fifteen dollars so it

00:04:49.070 --> 00:04:51.730 
amulet you can put this in the card and
I<00:04:49.550> mean<00:04:50.210> you<00:04:50.300> could<00:04:50.419> put<00:04:50.570> the<00:04:50.660> card<00:04:51.020> in<00:04:51.260> the

00:04:51.730 --> 00:04:51.740 
I mean you could put the card in the

00:04:51.740 --> 00:04:54.129 
I mean you could put the card in the
amlet<00:04:52.220> I<00:04:52.430> guess<00:04:52.639> you<00:04:52.759> close<00:04:53.000> it<00:04:53.030> up<00:04:53.330> and<00:04:53.570> it

00:04:54.129 --> 00:04:54.139 
amlet I guess you close it up and it

00:04:54.139 --> 00:04:56.290 
amlet I guess you close it up and it
will<00:04:54.349> probably<00:04:54.590> save<00:04:54.979> with<00:04:55.160> the<00:04:55.250> card<00:04:55.520> just

00:04:56.290 --> 00:04:56.300

00:04:56.300 --> 00:04:58.570 
will probably save with the card just
mattress<00:04:56.720> right<00:04:56.900> and<00:04:57.229> then<00:04:57.889> it's<00:04:58.220> a<00:04:58.310> little

00:04:58.570 --> 00:04:58.580 
mattress right and then it's a little

00:04:58.580 --> 00:05:01.600 
mattress right and then it's a little
