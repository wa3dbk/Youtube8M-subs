00:03:14.110 --> 00:03:18.370
 on your ip tv 

00:03:15.460 --> 00:03:21.100
 so you can watch them 

00:03:18.370 --> 00:03:23.860
 You will only choose the channel and watch 

00:03:21.100 --> 00:03:25.840
 and this channel will be transmitted in your 

00:03:23.860 --> 00:03:27.430
 leave it to him so you have to 

00:03:25.840 --> 00:03:28.750
 download the understood 

00:03:27.430 --> 00:03:34.570
 for example here I will give an example of the 

00:03:28.750 --> 00:03:40.000
 show view is the cartoon network 

00:03:34.570 --> 00:03:41.620
 Let's watch it here just to test it. 

00:03:40.000 --> 00:03:45.330
 here loading on the internet is a 

00:03:41.620 --> 00:03:45.330
 bit slow then it will take a while 

00:03:45.400 --> 00:03:54.610
 on the internet is not the best then 

00:03:48.090 --> 00:03:59.050
 here is already uploaded and the quality guys 

00:03:54.610 --> 00:04:02.670
 not bad not until it's good can not 

00:03:59.050 --> 00:04:06.160
 be considered the best but it is good 

00:04:02.670 --> 00:04:07.450
 I always watched here because the 

00:04:06.160 --> 00:04:08.950
 computer has a lot of advertising here 

00:04:07.450 --> 00:04:10.290
 also has no advertisement is one thing 

00:04:08.950 --> 00:04:13.810
 very cool said also 

00:04:10.290 --> 00:04:16.090
 and this is folly 

00:04:13.810 --> 00:04:19.299
 It's just you watch the channel you want 

00:04:16.090 --> 00:04:23.520
 now you come back there if it rained from the channel 

00:04:19.299 --> 00:04:25.750
 what is tnt 

00:04:23.520 --> 00:04:31.000
 wait a little here we were carrying 

00:04:25.750 --> 00:04:32.830
 watch and also was is the list is 

00:04:31.000 --> 00:04:36.790
 being updated all rights 

00:04:32.830 --> 00:04:39.760
 I went back unintentionally but it's okay, a string. 

00:04:36.790 --> 00:04:43.030
 besides the galera is being updated all 

00:04:39.760 --> 00:04:44.380
 the days and the people by the guy who made 

00:04:43.030 --> 00:04:47.440
 this playlist 

00:04:44.380 --> 00:04:49.120
 so if the channel goes bad 

00:04:47.440 --> 00:04:54.010
 the other day it is being updated 

00:04:49.120 --> 00:04:55.960
 in which trt will give a little bit of judgment 

00:04:54.010 --> 00:05:02.170
 because the internet is slow but it is 

00:04:55.960 --> 00:05:07.630
 well cool and this is it people are like me 

00:05:02.170 --> 00:05:10.120
 I told you if you have a channel on off it will be 

00:05:07.630 --> 00:05:11.470
 updated the other day then it's just you 

00:05:10.120 --> 00:05:13.690
 wait the other day is being 

00:05:11.470 --> 00:05:17.380
 updated being the game 

00:05:13.690 --> 00:05:20.890
 What happened today that will pass 

00:05:17.380 --> 00:05:21.550
 even though it always updates and that's it 

00:05:20.890 --> 00:05:24.040
