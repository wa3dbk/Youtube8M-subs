 the poppy seeds in a bowl and 

00:00:41.080 --> 00:00:46.300
 let's add flour salt and 

00:00:44.440 --> 00:00:50.190
 baking powder and with the help of a 

00:00:46.300 --> 00:00:50.190
 spoon we are going to mix it 

00:00:51.490 --> 00:00:55.850
 i 

00:00:53.480 --> 00:00:58.329
 once we have it well mixed what 

00:00:55.850 --> 00:00:58.329
 we reserve 

00:00:58.800 --> 00:01:04.830
 on the other hand we are going to beat the sugar 

00:01:01.530 --> 00:01:06.960
 together with the tulip margarine as you see 

00:01:04.830 --> 00:01:10.320
 I use margarine and tulip is 

00:01:06.960 --> 00:01:12.300
 many little things of our biscuits a 

00:01:10.320 --> 00:01:14.220
 well mixed once we stop for a second 

00:01:12.300 --> 00:01:16.320
 to beat and we're going to add the crÃ¨me 

00:01:14.220 --> 00:01:17.970
 fraiche already and the lemon zest and 

00:01:16.320 --> 00:01:20.900
 we beat again until everything is 

00:01:17.970 --> 00:01:20.900
 well integrated 

00:01:23.440 --> 00:01:35.020
 and then we are going to add the egg 

00:01:32.200 --> 00:01:36.880
 so we stop again and I take the 

00:01:35.020 --> 00:01:38.680
 egg and I break into a glass cup 

00:01:36.880 --> 00:01:40.480
 since I like to check that the egg 

00:01:38.680 --> 00:01:44.760
 is in good condition once the egg 

00:01:40.480 --> 00:01:44.760
 it's proven we add it and beat it 

00:01:46.479 --> 00:01:51.290
 and now that we have our mix 

00:01:49.010 --> 00:01:53.150
 we are going to add flour and 

00:01:51.290 --> 00:01:54.950
 poppy seeds and with the help of a 

00:01:53.150 --> 00:01:56.270
 mixing spoon let's go 

00:01:54.950 --> 00:01:58.390
 investigating what with movements 

00:01:56.270 --> 00:01:58.390
 envelopes 

00:01:59.970 --> 00:02:04.540
 i 

00:02:01.940 --> 00:02:04.540
 i 

00:02:11.240 --> 00:02:15.710
 already to finish we take the mixture and 

00:02:13.850 --> 00:02:18.290
 we are going to dump in our mold and 

00:02:15.710 --> 00:02:20.270
 using a 10 x 24 mold 

00:02:18.290 --> 00:02:24.370
 centimeters and we're going to bake it for 

00:02:20.270 --> 00:02:24.370
 30 minutes at 180 degrees 

00:02:27.750 --> 00:02:33.310
 once baked when it does not burn 

00:02:30.730 --> 00:02:36.610
 we remove the pin and unmold it and 

00:02:33.310 --> 00:02:38.380
