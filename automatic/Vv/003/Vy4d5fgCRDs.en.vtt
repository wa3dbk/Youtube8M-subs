00:00:22.860 --> 00:00:26.180
Hello, everybody! That’s NS and this is 15th issue of «I want to know» show.

00:00:26.180 --> 00:00:28.200
By the way, by popular demand…

00:00:28.660 --> 00:00:30.060
I’ve no freakin’ idea what that means…

00:00:30.260 --> 00:00:31.640
Alright, we can start now.

00:00:32.014 --> 00:00:34.014
By the way, friends, I almost forgot.

00:00:34.014 --> 00:00:35.134
We’ve got a competition today as well.

00:00:35.134 --> 00:00:36.654
And you can win one out of two toys.

00:00:36.980 --> 00:00:39.440
One is Bounty Hunter and the other one is Venomancer.

00:00:39.440 --> 00:00:41.440
They are really good looking and cool.

00:00:41.440 --> 00:00:42.520
To participate in competition,

00:00:42.520 --> 00:00:45.140
join Virtus.pro group in VKontake and join the raffle.

00:00:45.140 --> 00:00:46.604
The rules will be in the next head post in the group.

00:00:46.604 --> 00:00:47.104
Good luck!

00:00:47.940 --> 00:00:49.100
Let’s start with an easy thing!

00:00:49.300 --> 00:00:52.080
Pugna can hide Undying’s Tombstone to Astral

00:00:52.080 --> 00:00:55.080
to make it invulnerable for three and a half seconds.

00:00:55.080 --> 00:00:57.700
Three and a half seconds is a lot of time in Dota!

00:00:57.700 --> 00:01:02.020
You will have more than enough time to deal a lot of trouble to your enemies.

00:01:05.260 --> 00:01:06.380
And now something a bit harder!

00:01:06.900 --> 00:01:10.780
As you are going to learn, Rubick can be extremely effective versus Ember Spirit.

00:01:11.380 --> 00:01:13.840
Rubick steals Ember Spirit’s Fire Remnant

00:01:13.840 --> 00:01:16.600
and place up to three of it in any place of the map.

00:01:25.720 --> 00:01:29.340
After that Rubick has to steal any other skill from any other hero

00:01:29.340 --> 00:01:31.222
before Remnants will disappear.

00:01:31.780 --> 00:01:32.420
Wait a bit…

00:01:32.740 --> 00:01:36.740
Voila! Remnants are gone, but the overview they used to give us is still there!

00:01:36.740 --> 00:01:38.457
And it’s going to stay for the whole game!

00:01:38.460 --> 00:01:42.480
That’s the way we get free wards that cannot be destroyed.

00:01:42.980 --> 00:01:45.900
Besides that, Rubick can pull that trick a lot of times,

00:01:45.900 --> 00:01:49.200
and every time he can place three more Remnants on the map.

00:02:05.100 --> 00:02:07.800
Do you like Weaver? I like him very much!

00:02:07.800 --> 00:02:10.400
And I’ll share one interesting feature of this hero with you.

00:02:10.400 --> 00:02:12.195
If you’ll get Weaver an Aghanim's,

00:02:12.200 --> 00:02:15.760
you’ll be able to send your allies back in time for five seconds.

00:02:15.760 --> 00:02:17.880
Well, that’s not the feature – everybody knows it anyway.

00:02:18.360 --> 00:02:23.180
Feature is that this comeback in time don’t interrupt the abilities

00:02:23.180 --> 00:02:26.280
like Enigma’s and Witch Doctor’s Ults and stuff like that.

00:02:26.400 --> 00:02:29.780
Enigma makes Blink, casts Black Hole and comes back to where she was.

00:02:29.780 --> 00:02:31.840
The enemy is horrified and doesn’t understand what to do.

00:02:31.840 --> 00:02:33.263
Same goes for Witch Doctor.

00:02:33.263 --> 00:02:35.760
It works with other skills like that as well.

00:02:36.120 --> 00:02:38.660
Shadow Shaman’s Serpent, for example.

00:02:38.960 --> 00:02:41.480
But it’s not effective with Crystal Maiden at all.

00:02:41.480 --> 00:02:43.700
Her Ultimate works strictly around her,

00:02:43.700 --> 00:02:47.740
so if we’ll move her somewhere, Ultimate will follow her.

00:02:52.240 --> 00:02:53.320
Forth for today.

00:02:53.680 --> 00:02:57.860
You can save yourself from first lever Bloodseeker’s Ultimate by using flask.

00:02:57.860 --> 00:03:00.020
Just run and drink from the flask.

00:03:00.020 --> 00:03:04.560
It won’t stop its action. And you won’t lose a lot of health!

00:03:11.700 --> 00:03:12.480
And the last thing.

00:03:12.800 --> 00:03:16.880
There is one terrible bug-feature about Undying’s Tomb and Chen.

00:03:16.940 --> 00:03:20.000
Chen can entice zombies from the Tomb over his control.

00:03:20.180 --> 00:03:25.140
Zombies are quite dangerous, since they have 1000 HP unlike their original brothers.

00:03:25.140 --> 00:03:27.360
But they disappear when Tomb does…

00:03:27.600 --> 00:03:29.260
But that’s not the main point.

00:03:29.260 --> 00:03:31.620
After Chen entices at least one zombie,

00:03:31.620 --> 00:03:33.840
every time when Undying will place the Tomb,

00:03:33.840 --> 00:03:36.360
one of spawning zombies will belong to Chen.

00:03:36.880 --> 00:03:41.700
Therefore, if when you’re playing for Chen you’ll be enticing one or two zombie every time,

00:03:41.700 --> 00:03:46.900
after some time Tomb will become a real enemy for Undying and his team, instead of being his ally.

00:03:47.420 --> 00:03:50.200
And ten or so zombies with 1000 HP is not a joke!

00:03:52.520 --> 00:03:54.320
That’s it, guys, 15th issue came to its end.

00:03:54.320 --> 00:03:56.920

00:04:11.680 --> 00:04:14.240
Wow! It makes the sound, huh?

00:04:17.320 --> 00:04:17.820
Yeah…

00:04:21.240 --> 00:04:23.400
Life is just one huge piece of…

00:04:32.540 --> 00:04:35.480
Forth for today. You can sa…

00:04:37.020 --> 00:04:40.060
Forth for today. You can… f@#$%...

By the way, by popular demand…

00:04:44.895 --> 00:04:46.291
I’ve no freakin’ idea what that means…

00:04:46.291 --> 00:04:46.791
Read it!

00:04:46.791 --> 00:04:47.291
