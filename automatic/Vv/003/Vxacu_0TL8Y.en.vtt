well I think it's like that's part of
what's<00:03:10.940> happened<00:03:11.390> to<00:03:11.480> lay<00:03:11.630> ups<00:03:11.810> because

00:03:12.280 --> 00:03:12.290 
what's happened to lay ups because

00:03:12.290 --> 00:03:13.870 
what's happened to lay ups because
before<00:03:12.739> leg<00:03:12.980> it<00:03:13.070> was<00:03:13.190> like<00:03:13.280> this<00:03:13.400> creative

00:03:13.870 --> 00:03:13.880 
before leg it was like this creative

00:03:13.880 --> 00:03:16.420 
before leg it was like this creative
thing<00:03:14.120> make<00:03:14.450> all<00:03:14.570> this<00:03:14.630> yourself<00:03:15.310> but<00:03:16.310> when

00:03:16.420 --> 00:03:16.430 
thing make all this yourself but when

out of something that has been
Millennium<00:03:20.060> Falcon<00:03:20.450> on<00:03:20.540> the<00:03:20.660> box<00:03:20.840> you<00:03:21.320> might

00:03:21.460 --> 00:03:21.470 
Millennium Falcon on the box you might

00:03:23.110 --> 00:03:23.120 
as well buy it all made my point exactly

00:03:23.120 --> 00:03:25.480 
as well buy it all made my point exactly
so<00:03:24.019> here's<00:03:24.650> the<00:03:24.799> thing

00:03:25.480 --> 00:03:25.490 
so here's the thing

00:03:25.490 --> 00:03:27.040 
so here's the thing
why<00:03:25.730> what<00:03:26.060> happened<00:03:26.210> is<00:03:26.480> that<00:03:26.600> people<00:03:26.930> don't

00:03:27.040 --> 00:03:27.050 
why what happened is that people don't

00:03:27.050 --> 00:03:28.360 
why what happened is that people don't
want<00:03:27.230> to<00:03:27.260> be<00:03:27.350> creative<00:03:27.740> right<00:03:27.920> they<00:03:28.100> want<00:03:28.280> to

00:03:28.360 --> 00:03:28.370 
want to be creative right they want to

size<00:04:04.700> of<00:04:04.910> a<00:04:05.060> jelly<00:04:05.690> man's<00:04:05.900> gotta<00:04:06.170> know<00:04:06.230> his

00:04:06.340 --> 00:04:06.350 
size of a jelly man's gotta know his

00:04:06.350 --> 00:04:10.840 
size of a jelly man's gotta know his
limitations<00:04:06.500> a<00:04:07.900> little<00:04:08.900> oh<00:04:09.170> yeah<00:04:09.610> so<00:04:10.610> anyway

00:04:10.840 --> 00:04:10.850 
limitations a little oh yeah so anyway

00:04:10.850 --> 00:04:12.370 
limitations a little oh yeah so anyway
so<00:04:10.910> i<00:04:11.030> think<00:04:11.120> i<00:04:11.510> think<00:04:11.720> that's<00:04:11.870> basically<00:04:12.260> the

00:04:12.370 --> 00:04:12.380 
so i think i think that's basically the

00:04:12.380 --> 00:04:14.410 
so i think i think that's basically the
point<00:04:12.680> it's<00:04:13.040> like<00:04:13.220> the<00:04:13.760> eggs<00:04:13.850> are<00:04:14.030> gonna<00:04:14.150> buy

00:04:14.410 --> 00:04:14.420 
point it's like the eggs are gonna buy

00:04:14.420 --> 00:04:17.470 
point it's like the eggs are gonna buy
legos<00:04:14.900> for<00:04:15.290> your<00:04:15.440> kids<00:04:15.710> or<00:04:15.950> whatever<00:04:16.070> just<00:04:16.520> by

00:04:17.470 --> 00:04:17.480 
legos for your kids or whatever just by

00:04:17.480 --> 00:04:20.350 
legos for your kids or whatever just by
like<00:04:17.989> you<00:04:18.200> know<00:04:18.350> 500<00:04:18.709> little<00:04:19.459> blocks<00:04:19.850> and<00:04:20.239> let

00:04:20.350 --> 00:04:20.360 
like you know 500 little blocks and let

00:04:20.360 --> 00:04:21.789 
like you know 500 little blocks and let
them<00:04:20.540> like<00:04:20.690> build<00:04:20.989> whatever<00:04:21.170> they<00:04:21.410> want<00:04:21.590> then

00:04:21.789 --> 00:04:21.799 
them like build whatever they want then

00:04:21.799 --> 00:04:23.440 
them like build whatever they want then
then<00:04:22.070> the<00:04:22.160> sky's<00:04:22.400> the<00:04:22.430> limit<00:04:22.610> right<00:04:23.060> do<00:04:23.390> you

00:04:23.440 --> 00:04:23.450 
then the sky's the limit right do you

00:04:23.450 --> 00:04:25.930 
then the sky's the limit right do you
have<00:04:23.630> kids<00:04:23.810> no<00:04:24.470> so<00:04:25.310> there<00:04:25.430> are<00:04:25.520> you<00:04:25.640> telling

00:04:25.930 --> 00:04:25.940 
have kids no so there are you telling

00:04:25.940 --> 00:04:28.440 
have kids no so there are you telling
parents<00:04:26.090> what<00:04:26.360> they<00:04:26.390> should<00:04:26.600> do<00:04:26.720> it<00:04:27.260> cuz

00:04:28.440 --> 00:04:28.450 
parents what they should do it cuz

00:04:28.450 --> 00:04:35.020 
parents what they should do it cuz
because<00:04:29.450> I<00:04:29.630> know<00:04:32.680> no<00:04:33.680> what's<00:04:33.950> the<00:04:34.190> just<00:04:34.850> think

00:04:35.020 --> 00:04:35.030 
because I know no what's the just think

00:04:35.030 --> 00:04:37.560 
because I know no what's the just think
of<00:04:35.090> it<00:04:35.240> logically<00:04:35.780> right<00:04:36.050> makes<00:04:36.710> no<00:04:36.860> sense

00:04:37.560 --> 00:04:37.570 
of it logically right makes no sense

00:04:37.570 --> 00:04:39.760 
of it logically right makes no sense
unless<00:04:38.570> unless<00:04:38.990> they<00:04:39.110> don't<00:04:39.410> they're<00:04:39.740> not

00:04:39.760 --> 00:04:39.770 
unless unless they don't they're not

00:04:39.770 --> 00:04:41.410 
unless unless they don't they're not
very<00:04:40.040> creative<00:04:40.310> if<00:04:40.640> you<00:04:40.730> have<00:04:40.940> a<00:04:40.970> child<00:04:41.240> that's

00:05:20.830 --> 00:05:20.840 
if it were a Segway this this would be

00:05:20.840 --> 00:05:23.650 
if it were a Segway this this would be
balanced<00:05:21.260> by<00:05:21.380> gyroscopes<00:05:22.330> so

00:05:23.650 --> 00:05:23.660 
balanced by gyroscopes so

00:05:23.660 --> 00:05:25.570 
balanced by gyroscopes so
same<00:05:24.290> as<00:05:24.410> what<00:05:24.560> the<00:05:24.620> hell<00:05:24.770> was<00:05:24.860> a<00:05:24.890> segways

00:05:25.570 --> 00:05:25.580 
same as what the hell was a segways

00:05:25.580 --> 00:05:28.690 
same as what the hell was a segways
anyways<00:05:26.710> what<00:05:27.710> time<00:05:27.830> i<00:05:27.920> ever<00:05:27.950> saw<00:05:28.340> someone<00:05:28.580> use

00:05:28.690 --> 00:05:28.700 
anyways what time i ever saw someone use

00:05:28.700 --> 00:05:32.320 
anyways what time i ever saw someone use
a<00:05:28.730> Segway<00:05:29.210> ok<00:05:29.660> twice<00:05:30.020> once<00:05:30.830> that<00:05:31.370> was<00:05:31.490> in<00:05:31.730> her

00:05:32.320 --> 00:05:32.330 
a Segway ok twice once that was in her

00:05:32.330 --> 00:05:34.210 
a Segway ok twice once that was in her
side<00:05:32.600> now<00:05:32.990> actually<00:05:33.680> worked<00:05:33.830> pretty<00:05:33.920> well

00:05:34.210 --> 00:05:34.220 
side now actually worked pretty well

00:05:34.220 --> 00:05:36.310 
side now actually worked pretty well
then<00:05:34.760> I<00:05:34.940> was<00:05:35.060> in<00:05:35.150> a<00:05:35.210> science<00:05:35.630> center<00:05:35.810> in<00:05:36.140> with

00:05:36.310 --> 00:05:36.320 
then I was in a science center in with

00:05:36.320 --> 00:05:38.350 
then I was in a science center in with
your<00:05:36.440> guy<00:05:36.650> yes<00:05:37.190> inverse<00:05:37.520> idea<00:05:37.850> though<00:05:37.970> I<00:05:38.180> did

00:05:38.350 --> 00:05:38.360 
your guy yes inverse idea though I did

00:05:38.360 --> 00:05:39.670 
your guy yes inverse idea though I did
the<00:05:38.450> actual<00:05:38.570> no<00:05:39.020> like<00:05:39.050> right<00:05:39.320> outside<00:05:39.470> the

00:05:39.670 --> 00:05:39.680 
the actual no like right outside the

00:05:39.680 --> 00:05:41.650 
the actual no like right outside the
palace<00:05:39.950> and<00:05:40.100> then<00:05:40.310> the<00:05:40.730> other<00:05:40.760> time<00:05:41.210> was<00:05:41.360> in<00:05:41.540> a

00:05:41.650 --> 00:05:41.660 
palace and then the other time was in a

00:05:41.660 --> 00:05:43.270 
palace and then the other time was in a
science<00:05:42.110> center<00:05:42.290> where<00:05:42.890> the<00:05:42.920> guy<00:05:43.100> actually

00:05:43.270 --> 00:05:43.280 
science center where the guy actually

00:05:43.280 --> 00:05:45.460 
science center where the guy actually
fell<00:05:43.760> backwards<00:05:44.330> and<00:05:44.360> hit<00:05:44.450> his<00:05:44.600> head<00:05:44.630> oh<00:05:44.990> yeah

00:05:45.460 --> 00:05:45.470 
fell backwards and hit his head oh yeah

00:05:45.470 --> 00:05:47.560 
fell backwards and hit his head oh yeah
yeah<00:05:45.860> so<00:05:46.430> this<00:05:46.700> is<00:05:46.790> what<00:05:46.910> two<00:05:47.030> times<00:05:47.240> I've<00:05:47.360> seen

00:05:47.560 --> 00:05:47.570 
yeah so this is what two times I've seen

00:05:47.570 --> 00:05:49.990 
yeah so this is what two times I've seen
those<00:05:47.690> things<00:05:47.930> that's<00:05:48.230> awful<00:05:48.590> yeah<00:05:48.890> so<00:05:49.850> did

00:05:49.990 --> 00:05:50.000 
those things that's awful yeah so did

00:05:50.000 --> 00:05:52.000 
those things that's awful yeah so did
you<00:05:50.090> go<00:05:50.180> to<00:05:50.240> the<00:05:50.300> hall<00:05:50.450> of<00:05:50.480> mirrors<00:05:50.740> yeah<00:05:51.740> I<00:05:51.770> did

00:05:52.000 --> 00:05:52.010 
you go to the hall of mirrors yeah I did

00:05:52.010 --> 00:05:53.950 
you go to the hall of mirrors yeah I did
his<00:05:52.100> pit<00:05:52.310> bull<00:05:52.490> no<00:05:52.910> it<00:05:53.030> wasn't<00:05:53.060> that<00:05:53.570> was

00:05:53.950 --> 00:05:53.960 
his pit bull no it wasn't that was

00:05:53.960 --> 00:05:55.390 
his pit bull no it wasn't that was
boring<00:05:54.350> oh<00:05:54.530> ok<00:05:54.800> what<00:05:54.980> wasn't<00:05:55.130> an<00:05:55.280> actual

00:05:55.390 --> 00:05:55.400 
boring oh ok what wasn't an actual

00:05:55.400 --> 00:05:57.160 
boring oh ok what wasn't an actual
hollom<00:05:55.880> years<00:05:56.060> really<00:05:56.330> well<00:05:56.900> you<00:05:56.930> got<00:05:57.110> to

00:05:57.160 --> 00:05:57.170 
hollom years really well you got to

00:05:57.170 --> 00:05:58.450 
hollom years really well you got to
think<00:05:57.260> about<00:05:57.380> it<00:05:57.560> in<00:05:57.650> terms<00:05:57.680> of<00:05:58.040> that<00:05:58.220> you<00:05:58.340> have

00:05:58.450 --> 00:05:58.460 
think about it in terms of that you have

00:05:58.460 --> 00:05:59.710 
think about it in terms of that you have
to<00:05:58.550> but<00:05:58.670> in<00:05:58.760> terms<00:05:58.880> of<00:05:59.030> the<00:05:59.120> history<00:05:59.240> right

00:05:59.710 --> 00:05:59.720 
to but in terms of the history right

00:05:59.720 --> 00:06:01.570 
to but in terms of the history right
there<00:05:59.900> were<00:06:00.320> mirrors<00:06:00.710> and<00:06:00.950> merely<00:06:01.250> it's<00:06:01.400> not

00:06:01.570 --> 00:06:01.580 
there were mirrors and merely it's not

00:06:01.580 --> 00:06:03.490 
there were mirrors and merely it's not
as<00:06:01.670> if<00:06:01.730> I<00:06:02.270> really<00:06:02.570> reflective<00:06:03.110> that<00:06:03.320> gun

00:06:03.490 --> 00:06:03.500 
as if I really reflective that gun

00:06:03.500 --> 00:06:05.410 
as if I really reflective that gun
didn't<00:06:03.800> really<00:06:03.980> have<00:06:04.100> mirrors<00:06:04.520> yeah<00:06:04.910> so<00:06:05.300> those

00:06:05.410 --> 00:06:05.420 
didn't really have mirrors yeah so those

00:06:05.420 --> 00:06:07.090 
didn't really have mirrors yeah so those
cool<00:06:05.690> to<00:06:05.900> have<00:06:06.050> a<00:06:06.080> whole<00:06:06.410> bunch<00:06:06.560> of<00:06:06.740> mirrors

00:06:07.090 --> 00:06:07.100 
cool to have a whole bunch of mirrors

00:06:07.100 --> 00:06:09.340 
cool to have a whole bunch of mirrors
like<00:06:07.250> what<00:06:07.520> they<00:06:07.640> have<00:06:07.790> like<00:06:07.970> about<00:06:08.120> 12<00:06:08.570> well

00:06:09.340 --> 00:06:09.350 
like what they have like about 12 well

00:06:09.350 --> 00:06:10.420 
like what they have like about 12 well
yeah<00:06:09.500> but<00:06:09.680> like<00:06:09.770> this<00:06:09.920> is<00:06:10.010> if<00:06:10.100> I<00:06:10.220> that<00:06:10.340> they

00:06:10.420 --> 00:06:10.430 
yeah but like this is if I that they

00:06:10.430 --> 00:06:11.830 
yeah but like this is if I that they
were<00:06:10.520> like<00:06:10.670> this<00:06:10.880> and<00:06:11.150> like<00:06:11.210> this<00:06:11.330> and<00:06:11.810> like

00:06:11.830 --> 00:06:11.840 
were like this and like this and like

00:06:11.840 --> 00:06:13.180 
were like this and like this and like
this<00:06:11.960> and<00:06:12.260> they<00:06:12.320> led<00:06:12.470> up<00:06:12.590> to<00:06:12.620> that<00:06:12.740> it<00:06:13.040> was

00:06:13.180 --> 00:06:13.190 
this and they led up to that it was

00:06:13.190 --> 00:06:15.190 
this and they led up to that it was
pretty<00:06:13.370> cool<00:06:13.610> I<00:06:13.910> don't<00:06:14.420> know<00:06:14.480> you<00:06:14.840> just<00:06:14.990> like

00:06:15.190 --> 00:06:15.200 
pretty cool I don't know you just like

00:06:15.200 --> 00:06:19.660 
pretty cool I don't know you just like
history<00:06:16.210> I<00:06:17.560> just<00:06:18.560> don't<00:06:18.680> like<00:06:18.740> Legos<00:06:19.100> no<00:06:19.430> I<00:06:19.460> do

00:06:19.660 --> 00:06:19.670 
history I just don't like Legos no I do

00:06:19.670 --> 00:06:22.450 
history I just don't like Legos no I do
like<00:06:20.000> what<00:06:20.650> doesn't<00:06:21.650> like<00:06:21.740> Legos<00:06:22.040> me<00:06:22.160> he<00:06:22.220> wants

00:06:22.450 --> 00:06:22.460 
like what doesn't like Legos me he wants

00:06:22.460 --> 00:06:24.700 
like what doesn't like Legos me he wants
to<00:06:22.520> talk<00:06:22.730> about<00:06:22.760> them<00:06:23.150> that's<00:06:23.540> right<00:06:23.750> but<00:06:24.590> you

00:06:24.700 --> 00:06:24.710 
to talk about them that's right but you

00:06:24.710 --> 00:06:27.730 
to talk about them that's right but you
know<00:06:24.800> I<00:06:25.130> think<00:06:25.310> we've<00:06:25.640> made<00:06:25.790> our<00:06:25.850> point<00:06:26.740> you

00:06:27.730 --> 00:06:27.740 
know I think we've made our point you

00:06:27.740 --> 00:06:29.350 
know I think we've made our point you
know<00:06:27.860> we<00:06:28.370> had<00:06:28.490> a<00:06:28.520> little<00:06:28.700> detour<00:06:29.000> with<00:06:29.240> the

00:06:29.350 --> 00:06:29.360 
know we had a little detour with the

00:06:29.360 --> 00:06:31.030 
know we had a little detour with the
smoking<00:06:29.690> mirrors<00:06:30.050> with<00:06:30.350> just<00:06:30.530> the<00:06:30.620> mirrors<00:06:30.920> we

00:06:31.030 --> 00:06:31.040 
smoking mirrors with just the mirrors we

00:06:31.040 --> 00:06:33.970 
smoking mirrors with just the mirrors we
didn't<00:06:31.250> do<00:06:31.310> the<00:06:31.340> smoke<00:06:31.610> and<00:06:32.260> so<00:06:33.260> I<00:06:33.560> think<00:06:33.680> that

00:06:33.970 --> 00:06:33.980 
didn't do the smoke and so I think that

00:06:33.980 --> 00:06:39.460 
didn't do the smoke and so I think that
the<00:06:34.850> secre<00:06:35.150> is<00:06:35.570> now<00:06:36.760> actually<00:06:37.760> not<00:06:38.690> overturned

00:06:39.460 --> 00:06:39.470 
the secre is now actually not overturned

00:06:39.470 --> 00:06:42.010 
the secre is now actually not overturned
so<00:06:40.040> I<00:06:40.100> think<00:06:40.340> we<00:06:40.700> spoke<00:06:41.000> completed<00:06:41.690> our<00:06:41.780> goal

00:06:42.010 --> 00:06:42.020 
so I think we spoke completed our goal

00:06:42.020 --> 00:06:47.320 
so I think we spoke completed our goal
and<00:06:43.690> ghulam<00:06:44.690> angles<00:06:45.490> Justin<00:06:46.490> said<00:06:46.790> that's
