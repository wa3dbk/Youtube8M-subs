00:00:44.590 --> 00:00:44.600 
always massive but this one could be

00:00:44.600 --> 00:00:46.600 
always massive but this one could be
even<00:00:44.840> more<00:00:45.170> important<00:00:45.800> for<00:00:45.890> a<00:00:45.950> madrid<00:00:46.280> where

00:00:46.600 --> 00:00:46.610 
even more important for a madrid where

it could well be decisive there is

00:00:47.840 --> 00:00:49.510

always<00:00:48.200> a<00:00:48.230> feeling<00:00:48.560> about<00:00:48.649> Clasicos<00:00:49.190> almost

00:00:49.510 --> 00:00:49.520 
always a feeling about Clasicos almost

00:00:49.520 --> 00:00:51.040 
always a feeling about Clasicos almost
as<00:00:49.640> if<00:00:49.760> they<00:00:49.880> somehow<00:00:50.030> define<00:00:50.540> an<00:00:50.720> area<00:00:50.899> that

00:00:51.040 --> 00:00:51.050 
as if they somehow define an area that

00:00:51.050 --> 00:00:52.780 
as if they somehow define an area that
they<00:00:51.260> end<00:00:51.410> cycle<00:00:51.890> and<00:00:51.980> they<00:00:52.040> begin<00:00:52.309> new<00:00:52.550> ones

00:00:52.780 --> 00:00:52.790 
they end cycle and they begin new ones

00:00:52.790 --> 00:00:54.639 
they end cycle and they begin new ones
but<00:00:53.000> this<00:00:53.300> is<00:00:53.480> really<00:00:53.690> significant<00:00:54.290> because<00:00:54.440> i

00:00:54.639 --> 00:00:54.649 
but this is really significant because i

00:00:54.649 --> 00:00:56.740 
but this is really significant because i
think<00:00:54.829> for<00:00:55.670> al-majid<00:00:55.940> it's<00:00:56.149> an<00:00:56.270> opportunity

00:00:56.740 --> 00:00:56.750 
think for al-majid it's an opportunity

00:00:56.750 --> 00:00:58.240 
think for al-majid it's an opportunity
to<00:00:56.840> go<00:00:56.960> seven<00:00:57.260> points<00:00:57.500> clear<00:00:57.530> which<00:00:57.980> if<00:00:58.130> they

00:00:58.240 --> 00:00:58.250 
to go seven points clear which if they

00:00:58.250 --> 00:00:59.410 
to go seven points clear which if they
were<00:00:58.309> to<00:00:58.579> go<00:00:58.670> seven<00:00:58.940> points<00:00:59.149> clear<00:00:59.180> of

00:00:59.410 --> 00:00:59.420 
were to go seven points clear of

00:00:59.420 --> 00:01:00.940 
were to go seven points clear of
barcelona<00:00:59.960> by<00:01:00.170> the<00:01:00.230> way<00:01:00.380> because<00:01:00.680> it<00:01:00.800> still

00:01:00.940 --> 00:01:00.950 
barcelona by the way because it still

00:01:00.950 --> 00:01:02.440 
barcelona by the way because it still
Atletico<00:01:01.370> Madrid<00:01:01.640> to<00:01:01.760> worry<00:01:01.910> about<00:01:02.000> if<00:01:02.300> that

00:01:02.440 --> 00:01:02.450 
Atletico Madrid to worry about if that

00:01:02.450 --> 00:01:04.299 
Atletico Madrid to worry about if that
was<00:01:02.570> to<00:01:02.690> happen<00:01:02.840> genuinely<00:01:03.829> I<00:01:03.920> think<00:01:04.220> that

00:01:04.299 --> 00:01:04.309 
was to happen genuinely I think that

00:01:04.309 --> 00:01:05.410 
was to happen genuinely I think that
would<00:01:04.430> be<00:01:04.489> the<00:01:04.580> end<00:01:04.610> of<00:01:04.759> the<00:01:04.820> title<00:01:05.149> race<00:01:05.239> for

00:01:05.410 --> 00:01:05.420 
would be the end of the title race for

00:01:05.420 --> 00:01:06.670 
would be the end of the title race for
Barcelona<00:01:05.750> which<00:01:05.930> is<00:01:06.050> why<00:01:06.170> from<00:01:06.290> Madrid<00:01:06.560> this

00:01:06.670 --> 00:01:06.680 
Barcelona which is why from Madrid this

00:01:06.680 --> 00:01:08.740 
Barcelona which is why from Madrid this
is<00:01:06.800> a<00:01:06.830> huge<00:01:07.130> opportunity<00:01:07.280> for<00:01:07.880> Barcelona<00:01:08.600> it's

victory<00:05:06.250> and<00:05:06.490> I<00:05:06.550> think<00:05:06.729> that's<00:05:06.879> one<00:05:07.090> of<00:05:07.120> the

00:05:07.230 --> 00:05:07.240 
victory and I think that's one of the

00:05:07.240 --> 00:05:09.149 
victory and I think that's one of the
doubts<00:05:07.539> that<00:05:07.750> has<00:05:08.199> surrounded<00:05:08.379> by<00:05:08.770> some<00:05:09.009> this

00:05:09.149 --> 00:05:09.159 
doubts that has surrounded by some this

00:05:09.159 --> 00:05:11.159 
doubts that has surrounded by some this
year<00:05:09.370> is<00:05:09.490> about<00:05:09.879> the<00:05:10.150> style<00:05:10.419> to<00:05:10.750> what<00:05:10.840> extent

00:05:11.159 --> 00:05:11.169 
year is about the style to what extent

00:05:11.169 --> 00:05:12.540 
year is about the style to what extent
Tata<00:05:11.379> Martino<00:05:11.800> is<00:05:11.830> trying<00:05:12.190> to<00:05:12.280> take<00:05:12.400> them

00:05:12.540 --> 00:05:12.550 
Tata Martino is trying to take them

00:05:12.550 --> 00:05:14.100 
Tata Martino is trying to take them
towards<00:05:12.759> a<00:05:12.819> different<00:05:13.120> style<00:05:13.360> to<00:05:13.810> what<00:05:13.900> extent

00:05:14.100 --> 00:05:14.110 
towards a different style to what extent

00:05:14.110 --> 00:05:15.899 
towards a different style to what extent
he's<00:05:14.349> may<00:05:14.530> be<00:05:14.590> obliged<00:05:15.190> to<00:05:15.219> take<00:05:15.520> them<00:05:15.669> towards

00:05:15.899 --> 00:05:15.909 
he's may be obliged to take them towards

00:05:15.909 --> 00:05:18.149 
he's may be obliged to take them towards
a<00:05:15.940> different<00:05:16.210> style<00:05:16.389> and<00:05:16.539> then<00:05:17.139> is<00:05:17.530> it

00:05:18.149 --> 00:05:18.159 
a different style and then is it

00:05:18.159 --> 00:05:19.409 
a different style and then is it
possible<00:05:18.520> to<00:05:18.550> do<00:05:18.759> that<00:05:18.789> so<00:05:19.090> there's<00:05:19.270> been<00:05:19.360> a

00:05:19.409 --> 00:05:19.419 
possible to do that so there's been a

00:05:19.419 --> 00:05:21.119 
possible to do that so there's been a
certain<00:05:19.629> degree<00:05:19.840> of<00:05:19.990> resistance<00:05:20.349> to<00:05:20.680> it<00:05:20.919> there

00:05:21.119 --> 00:05:21.129 
certain degree of resistance to it there

00:05:21.129 --> 00:05:22.230 
certain degree of resistance to it there
have<00:05:21.219> been<00:05:21.370> others<00:05:21.610> that<00:05:21.729> think<00:05:21.909> it<00:05:22.000> should<00:05:22.210> be

00:05:22.230 --> 00:05:22.240 
have been others that think it should be

00:05:22.240 --> 00:05:24.240 
have been others that think it should be
sped<00:05:22.659> up<00:05:22.690> that<00:05:22.990> process<00:05:23.199> and<00:05:23.710> I<00:05:23.979> think<00:05:24.009> what

00:05:24.240 --> 00:05:24.250 
sped up that process and I think what

00:05:24.250 --> 00:05:26.909 
sped up that process and I think what
we've<00:05:24.400> seen<00:05:24.639> is<00:05:24.909> is<00:05:25.060> the<00:05:25.449> the<00:05:25.930> formation<00:05:26.590> shift

00:05:26.909 --> 00:05:26.919 
we've seen is is the the formation shift

00:05:26.919 --> 00:05:29.909 
we've seen is is the the formation shift
to<00:05:27.460> try<00:05:27.669> and<00:05:27.789> fit<00:05:27.940> those<00:05:28.120> players<00:05:28.389> who<00:05:28.719> on<00:05:29.289> key

00:05:29.909 --> 00:05:29.919 
to try and fit those players who on key

00:05:29.919 --> 00:05:31.439 
to try and fit those players who on key
moments<00:05:30.310> anyway<00:05:30.430> those<00:05:30.879> players<00:05:31.120> who<00:05:31.210> keep

00:05:31.439 --> 00:05:31.449 
moments anyway those players who keep

00:05:31.449 --> 00:05:33.089 
moments anyway those players who keep
the<00:05:31.569> ball<00:05:31.719> better<00:05:31.900> so<00:05:32.169> for<00:05:32.319> example<00:05:32.409> we<00:05:32.710> saw<00:05:32.979> in

00:05:33.089 --> 00:05:33.099 
the ball better so for example we saw in

00:05:33.099 --> 00:05:34.740 
the ball better so for example we saw in
the<00:05:33.159> two<00:05:33.310> games<00:05:33.490> against<00:05:33.879> Manchester<00:05:34.300> City<00:05:34.330> in

four hours off your dad and that is a
