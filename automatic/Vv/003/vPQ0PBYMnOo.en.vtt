00:01:35.450 --> 00:01:40.490

00:01:37.280 --> 00:01:41.360

00:01:40.490 --> 00:01:44.770
 very great experience 

00:01:41.360 --> 00:01:44.770
 I was interested to go 

00:01:50.440 --> 00:01:54.580

00:01:52.270 --> 00:01:56.170

 more than 20 people already 

00:01:56.170 --> 00:02:01.090
 and even more than 40 are expected 

00:01:59.260 --> 00:02:01.570
 that more than 60 were registered 

00:02:01.090 --> 00:02:03.760
