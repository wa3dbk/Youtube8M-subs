 that the area will have a faster 

00:01:58.620 --> 00:02:02.520
 Such a thing is interesting. 

00:02:00.030 --> 00:02:05.100

00:02:02.520 --> 00:02:08.580

 already made you control the character 

00:02:16.050 --> 00:02:20.730
 in your case you've created that the 

00:02:19.140 --> 00:02:23.370
 other members of your group you can 

00:02:20.730 --> 00:02:25.350
 help you out with a tactical camera 

00:02:23.370 --> 00:02:27.600
 beans you want the car to have in a 

00:02:25.350 --> 00:02:29.130
 style of defense that one attacks a 

00:02:27.600 --> 00:02:31.020
 this beautiful character you can 

00:02:29.130 --> 00:02:34.650

00:02:39.900 --> 00:02:44.910
 a differentiated so extreme and 

00:02:42.240 --> 00:02:47.280
 differentiated from several games there that already 

00:02:44.910 --> 00:02:50.400
 were made of r fish with you should already 

00:02:47.280 --> 00:02:52.380
 have encountered multiple RPG games 

00:02:50.400 --> 00:02:54.660
 You will have the skills then speak one 

00:02:52.380 --> 00:02:56.370
 little about it here now then let's go 

00:02:54.660 --> 00:02:58.920
 start here today you will have a 

00:02:56.370 --> 00:03:01.430
 giant tree of skills was to see the 

00:02:58.920 --> 00:03:04.050
 corinthians who attack defense 

00:03:01.430 --> 00:03:07.550
 strategy you can also choose 

00:03:04.050 --> 00:03:09.690
 from the members of your group 

00:03:07.550 --> 00:03:11.310
 You 're going to be able to be like a 

00:03:09.690 --> 00:03:14.489
 character for the defense character 

00:03:11.310 --> 00:03:16.890
 protec character and self and a character 

00:03:14.489 --> 00:03:19.049
 to do something like his 

00:03:16.890 --> 00:03:21.780
 side then you will have to have evolved 

00:03:19.049 --> 00:03:23.010
 in defense be bagwell and this I found 

00:03:21.780 --> 00:03:24.780
 very interesting, right? 

00:03:23.010 --> 00:03:26.580
 you will also be able to be changing around the 

00:03:24.780 --> 00:03:28.799
 equipment of your teammates or 

00:03:26.580 --> 00:03:30.540
 whether you find a gun but do not look 

00:03:28.799 --> 00:03:33.120
 that one already had you will be able to play 

00:03:30.540 --> 00:03:35.070
 this had not in the previous game will 

00:03:33.120 --> 00:03:37.739
 talk a little bit of multiplayer 

00:03:35.070 --> 00:03:40.590
 game how does it work how does it go 

00:03:37.739 --> 00:03:43.230
 yes good seduction these things that are 

00:03:40.590 --> 00:03:45.870
 make our black toilet so the 

00:03:43.230 --> 00:03:49.860
 sim game and will offer a multiplayer 

00:03:45.870 --> 00:03:52.049
 where you will get it is that you have more 

00:03:49.860 --> 00:03:55.320
 players who must survive in 

00:03:52.049 --> 00:03:56.550
 several good big bills I bought the 

00:03:55.320 --> 00:03:58.650
 johrei of the common 

00:03:56.550 --> 00:04:00.360
 the multiplayer it was not very good 

00:03:58.650 --> 00:04:02.310
 dude because there was nobody like that 

00:04:00.360 --> 00:04:04.380
 playing multiplayer so I could not 

00:04:02.310 --> 00:04:06.900
 enjoy it is very well but then 

00:04:04.380 --> 00:04:09.300
 I got to play and I found it very cool. 

00:04:06.900 --> 00:04:11.910
 very interesting guy he is doing is 

00:04:09.300 --> 00:04:14.310
 the cdu elected a little bit of the campaign and 

00:04:11.910 --> 00:04:16.350
 I highly recommend multiplayer let's 

00:04:14.310 --> 00:04:18.600
 speak a little on the map of the game is 

00:04:16.350 --> 00:04:21.750
 although it is not a world game 

00:04:18.600 --> 00:04:25.020
 open is good and already shows a map more 

00:04:21.750 --> 00:04:28.770
 than this the big role and 

00:04:25.020 --> 00:04:30.540
 he has huge areas are exploring and 

00:04:28.770 --> 00:04:33.210
 the scenario of the game case is so incredible 

00:04:30.540 --> 00:04:35.460
 graphic is very good even though it 

00:04:33.210 --> 00:04:37.350
 not be those games so invested 

00:04:35.460 --> 00:04:39.900
 close to the graph but thanks to the 

00:04:37.350 --> 00:04:43.380
 incredible face to the wood of the trees 

00:04:39.900 --> 00:04:47.160
 the leaf of the trees and the shadow is the smoke 

00:04:43.380 --> 00:04:50.850
 the attacks on your car is awesome 

00:04:47.160 --> 00:04:52.830
 What is the climate change of the game? 

00:04:50.850 --> 00:04:55.350
 very good the same as the law 

00:04:52.830 --> 00:04:58.500
 so guys it's also going to try 

00:04:55.350 --> 00:05:00.870
 find several secondary missions there 

00:04:58.500 --> 00:05:05.010
 throughout this gameplay and this truth 

00:05:00.870 --> 00:05:07.140
 they give you a kind of power, that is 

00:05:05.010 --> 00:05:10.169
 You'll complete the mission and at night give 

00:05:07.140 --> 00:05:11.730
 a fear more or less where power and with 

00:05:10.169 --> 00:05:13.380
 this power you will be able to release 

00:05:11.730 --> 00:05:15.290
 people who more than willing to give 

00:05:13.380 --> 00:05:17.640
 continuity to this is then extremely 

00:05:15.290 --> 00:05:18.300
 necessary for the pope to be exploited in 

00:05:17.640 --> 00:05:20.250
 interest 

00:05:18.300 --> 00:05:21.780
 although very repetitive of the 

00:05:20.250 --> 00:05:23.850
 secondary missions 

00:05:21.780 --> 00:05:25.710
 they have the theme come out a lot 

00:05:23.850 --> 00:05:27.960
 interesting and after a while you 

00:05:25.710 --> 00:05:29.100
 It's going to be a year but it's really fun to do. 

00:05:27.960 --> 00:05:31.080
 beautiful defense 

00:05:29.100 --> 00:05:33.210
 despite presenting one of the bandits 

00:05:31.080 --> 00:05:34.350
 I bring today that 2011 can be considered 

00:05:33.210 --> 00:05:38.190
 one of the best 

00:05:34.350 --> 00:05:40.290
 the mpx of the year 

00:05:38.190 --> 00:05:41.880
 It's a game I liked the damn thing. 

00:05:40.290 --> 00:05:44.610
 amazing graphics has a history 

00:05:41.880 --> 00:05:46.620
 very cool though the repetitive cnn 

00:05:44.610 --> 00:05:49.169
 but I liked as hell defends a 

00:05:46.620 --> 00:05:50.910
 are very well made and the weapons are 

00:05:49.169 --> 00:05:52.770
 very cool, it's very cool, those 

00:05:50.910 --> 00:05:54.870

00:06:03.639 --> 00:06:07.060
 comment that I can improve 

00:06:05.350 --> 00:06:08.830
 I followed the channel in the last few 

00:06:07.060 --> 00:06:10.240

00:06:08.830 --> 00:06:12.580
