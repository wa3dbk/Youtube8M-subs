well<00:00:29.429> this<00:00:29.580> is<00:00:29.699> why<00:00:29.849> CPUs<00:00:30.330> aren't<00:00:30.720> marketed<00:00:31.289> by

00:00:31.429 --> 00:00:31.439 
well this is why CPUs aren't marketed by

00:00:31.439 --> 00:00:33.229 
well this is why CPUs aren't marketed by
their<00:00:31.619> gigahertz<00:00:31.949> rating<00:00:32.489> any<00:00:32.640> more<00:00:32.880> the

their gigahertz rating any more the
short<00:00:33.420> version<00:00:33.719> is<00:00:34.110> you<00:00:34.260> can<00:00:34.380> do<00:00:34.469> a<00:00:34.500> lot<00:00:34.800> more

00:00:34.819 --> 00:00:34.829 
short version is you can do a lot more

00:00:34.829 --> 00:00:37.280 
short version is you can do a lot more
work<00:00:35.280> 1600<00:00:36.120> times<00:00:36.360> per<00:00:36.600> second<00:00:36.930> on<00:00:37.020> the<00:00:37.110> core

00:00:37.290 --> 00:00:40.520 
work 1600 times per second on the core
i7<00:00:37.410> then<00:00:38.250> you<00:00:38.399> can't<00:00:38.670> on<00:00:38.879> the<00:00:38.910> Atom<00:00:39.239> CPU<00:00:39.530> think

00:00:40.530 --> 00:00:42.260 
i7 then you can't on the Atom CPU think
of<00:00:40.590> the<00:00:40.649> difference<00:00:41.010> between<00:00:41.100> say<00:00:41.670> a<00:00:41.910> Honda

00:00:42.260 --> 00:00:42.270 
of the difference between say a Honda

00:00:42.270 --> 00:00:44.479 
of the difference between say a Honda
scooter<00:00:42.629> running<00:00:42.930> at<00:00:43.050> 3000<00:00:43.649> rpm<00:00:44.070> versus<00:00:44.460> a

scooter running at 3000 rpm versus a

00:00:44.489 --> 00:00:47.479 
scooter running at 3000 rpm versus a
Formula<00:00:45.000> one<00:00:45.239> engine<00:00:45.289> running<00:00:46.289> at<00:00:46.410> 3000<00:00:47.100> rpm

Formula one engine running at 3000 rpm

00:00:47.489 --> 00:00:50.450 
Formula one engine running at 3000 rpm
they're<00:00:47.730> both<00:00:47.910> running<00:00:48.149> at<00:00:48.390> 3000<00:00:49.079> rpm<00:00:49.500> doing

they're both running at 3000 rpm doing

00:00:50.460 --> 00:00:53.240 
they're both running at 3000 rpm doing
the<00:00:50.579> same<00:00:50.820> it<00:00:51.090> is<00:00:51.120> different<00:00:51.780> yeah<00:00:52.710> one<00:00:53.219> of

00:00:53.240 --> 00:00:53.250 
the same it is different yeah one of

00:00:53.250 --> 00:00:54.529 
the same it is different yeah one of
those<00:00:53.399> two<00:00:53.640> is<00:00:53.760> probably<00:00:53.940> moving<00:00:54.329> a<00:00:54.390> lot

00:00:54.529 --> 00:00:54.539 
those two is probably moving a lot

00:00:54.539 --> 00:00:56.450 
those two is probably moving a lot
faster<00:00:54.960> than<00:00:55.079> the<00:00:55.289> other<00:00:55.320> even<00:00:56.190> though<00:00:56.280> the

00:00:56.450 --> 00:00:56.460 
faster than the other even though the

00:00:56.460 --> 00:00:58.520 
faster than the other even though the
tachometer<00:00:56.850> says<00:00:57.360> the<00:00:57.510> engines<00:00:57.840> are<00:00:58.079> turning

00:00:58.520 --> 00:00:58.530 
tachometer says the engines are turning

00:00:58.530 --> 00:01:02.270 
tachometer says the engines are turning
over<00:00:58.710> at<00:00:58.800> the<00:00:58.920> same<00:00:59.100> speed<00:00:59.460> yeah<00:01:00.149> I<00:01:01.280> started

00:01:02.270 --> 00:01:02.280 
over at the same speed yeah I started

00:01:02.280 --> 00:01:03.590 
over at the same speed yeah I started
twitching<00:01:02.489> when<00:01:02.730> I<00:01:02.760> read<00:01:02.940> this<00:01:03.090> question<00:01:03.449> cuz

00:01:03.590 --> 00:01:03.600 
twitching when I read this question cuz

00:01:03.600 --> 00:01:04.880 
twitching when I read this question cuz
it's<00:01:03.719> like<00:01:03.840> a<00:01:03.899> where<00:01:04.110> do<00:01:04.260> I<00:01:04.320> start

00:01:04.880 --> 00:01:04.890 
it's like a where do I start

00:01:04.890 --> 00:01:06.620 
it's like a where do I start
right<00:01:05.010> the<00:01:05.159> core<00:01:05.369> i7<00:01:05.790> bus<00:01:06.030> runs<00:01:06.360> more<00:01:06.570> than

00:01:06.620 --> 00:01:06.630 
right the core i7 bus runs more than

00:01:06.630 --> 00:01:08.510 
right the core i7 bus runs more than
twice<00:01:06.930> as<00:01:07.140> fast<00:01:07.409> as<00:01:07.680> the<00:01:07.799> bus<00:01:07.979> that's<00:01:08.159> feeding

00:01:08.510 --> 00:01:08.520 
twice as fast as the bus that's feeding

00:01:08.520 --> 00:01:10.580 
twice as fast as the bus that's feeding
data<00:01:08.729> for<00:01:09.330> the<00:01:09.390> Atom<00:01:09.689> processor<00:01:09.720> it's<00:01:10.439> got<00:01:10.470> a

00:01:10.580 --> 00:01:10.590 
data for the Atom processor it's got a

00:01:10.590 --> 00:01:12.469 
data for the Atom processor it's got a
faster<00:01:10.979> chipset<00:01:11.430> so<00:01:11.460> it<00:01:11.700> moves<00:01:11.880> data<00:01:12.030> faster

00:01:12.469 --> 00:01:12.479 
faster chipset so it moves data faster

00:01:12.479 --> 00:01:13.760 
faster chipset so it moves data faster
in<00:01:12.570> and<00:01:12.720> out<00:01:12.840> from<00:01:12.990> light<00:01:13.200> memory<00:01:13.560> in<00:01:13.680> the

00:01:13.760 --> 00:01:13.770 
in and out from light memory in the

00:01:13.770 --> 00:01:15.410 
in and out from light memory in the
process<00:01:14.189> of<00:01:14.310> the<00:01:14.369> memory<00:01:14.700> moves<00:01:14.880> faster<00:01:15.330> it's

00:01:15.410 --> 00:01:15.420 
process of the memory moves faster it's

00:01:15.420 --> 00:01:17.420 
process of the memory moves faster it's
got<00:01:15.540> a<00:01:15.570> larger<00:01:15.900> cache<00:01:16.140> in<00:01:16.380> the<00:01:16.439> core<00:01:16.619> i7<00:01:16.770> it's

00:01:17.420 --> 00:01:17.430 
got a larger cache in the core i7 it's

00:01:17.430 --> 00:01:20.570 
got a larger cache in the core i7 it's
got<00:01:17.580> 4<00:01:17.880> cores<00:01:18.210> to<00:01:18.390> an<00:01:18.479> atom's<00:01:18.780> 1<00:01:18.990> or<00:01:19.110> 2<00:01:19.290> cores<00:01:19.650> so

00:01:20.570 --> 00:01:20.580 
got 4 cores to an atom's 1 or 2 cores so

00:01:20.580 --> 00:01:22.880 
got 4 cores to an atom's 1 or 2 cores so
I<00:01:21.090> could<00:01:21.570> spend<00:01:21.720> a<00:01:21.780> lot<00:01:22.049> of<00:01:22.080> time<00:01:22.439> explaining

00:01:22.880 --> 00:01:22.890 
I could spend a lot of time explaining

00:01:22.890 --> 00:01:24.289 
I could spend a lot of time explaining
like<00:01:23.040> the<00:01:23.250> intricate<00:01:23.670> details<00:01:24.060> of<00:01:24.180> the

00:01:24.289 --> 00:01:24.299 
like the intricate details of the

00:01:24.299 --> 00:01:25.789 
like the intricate details of the

movements of zeros and ones around the

00:01:25.799 --> 00:01:27.410 
movements of zeros and ones around the
processor<00:01:26.340> and<00:01:26.520> basically<00:01:26.909> how<00:01:27.060> many<00:01:27.119> were

00:01:27.410 --> 00:01:27.420 
processor and basically how many were

00:01:27.420 --> 00:01:30.560 
processor and basically how many were
it's<00:01:27.750> just<00:01:28.189> more<00:01:29.189> work<00:01:29.220> is<00:01:29.700> done<00:01:29.939> per<00:01:30.270> clock

00:01:30.560 --> 00:01:30.570 
it's just more work is done per clock

00:01:30.570 --> 00:01:32.960 
it's just more work is done per clock
cycle<00:01:30.630> on<00:01:31.290> a<00:01:31.350> core<00:01:31.619> i7<00:01:31.770> than<00:01:32.340> it's<00:01:32.490> done<00:01:32.670> on
