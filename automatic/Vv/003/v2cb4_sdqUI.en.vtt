you take a look let's talk a little bit
about<00:01:20.820> warded<00:01:21.540> locks<00:01:21.810> for<00:01:22.170> a<00:01:22.200> moment<00:01:22.590> this<00:01:22.680> is

00:01:22.730 --> 00:01:22.740 
about warded locks for a moment this is

00:01:22.740 --> 00:01:25.010 
about warded locks for a moment this is
a<00:01:22.890> very<00:01:23.340> old<00:01:23.549> lock<00:01:23.880> and<00:01:24.150> this<00:01:24.270> these<00:01:24.689> keys<00:01:24.990> are

00:01:25.010 --> 00:01:25.020 
a very old lock and this these keys are

00:01:25.020 --> 00:01:27.080 
a very old lock and this these keys are
pretty<00:01:25.380> old<00:01:25.530> technology<00:01:26.340> let<00:01:26.729> me<00:01:26.790> turn<00:01:26.970> this

00:01:27.080 --> 00:01:27.090 
pretty old technology let me turn this

00:01:27.090 --> 00:01:29.510 
pretty old technology let me turn this
over<00:01:27.390> so<00:01:27.540> I<00:01:27.600> can<00:01:27.780> use<00:01:28.530> my<00:01:28.560> pointer<00:01:29.250> here<00:01:29.490> a

00:01:29.510 --> 00:01:29.520 
over so I can use my pointer here a

00:01:29.520 --> 00:01:33.350 
over so I can use my pointer here a
little<00:01:29.670> bit<00:01:29.850> in<00:01:30.680> warded<00:01:31.680> locks<00:01:31.950> the<00:01:32.640> all<00:01:32.939> of

00:01:33.350 --> 00:01:33.360 
little bit in warded locks the all of

00:01:33.360 --> 00:01:35.420 
little bit in warded locks the all of
the<00:01:33.450> locks<00:01:33.689> internally<00:01:34.470> are<00:01:34.590> different<00:01:35.009> only

00:01:35.420 --> 00:01:35.430 
the locks internally are different only

00:01:35.430 --> 00:01:36.800 
the locks internally are different only
that<00:01:35.729> they<00:01:35.909> put<00:01:36.150> up<00:01:36.270> these<00:01:36.390> little<00:01:36.659> metal

00:01:36.800 --> 00:01:36.810 
that they put up these little metal

00:01:36.810 --> 00:01:39.560 
that they put up these little metal
walls<00:01:37.200> called<00:01:37.770> wards<00:01:38.310> and<00:01:38.610> the<00:01:38.850> little<00:01:39.060> wards

00:01:39.560 --> 00:01:39.570 
walls called wards and the little wards

00:01:39.570 --> 00:01:41.630 
walls called wards and the little wards
fit<00:01:39.869> into<00:01:40.259> these<00:01:40.590> little<00:01:40.950> grooves<00:01:41.250> and<00:01:41.520> there

00:01:41.630 --> 00:01:41.640 
fit into these little grooves and there

00:01:41.640 --> 00:01:44.270 
fit into these little grooves and there
are<00:01:41.700> different<00:01:42.000> depths<00:01:42.509> as<00:01:42.720> you<00:01:42.930> can<00:01:43.140> see<00:01:43.350> so

00:01:44.270 --> 00:01:44.280 
are different depths as you can see so

00:01:44.280 --> 00:01:45.980 
are different depths as you can see so
if<00:01:44.399> you<00:01:44.490> put<00:01:44.670> the<00:01:44.790> wrong<00:01:44.970> key<00:01:45.270> in<00:01:45.479> and<00:01:45.750> the

00:01:45.980 --> 00:01:45.990 
if you put the wrong key in and the

00:01:45.990 --> 00:01:47.600 
if you put the wrong key in and the
little<00:01:46.229> groove<00:01:46.530> doesn't<00:01:47.070> line<00:01:47.220> up<00:01:47.250> with<00:01:47.579> that

00:01:47.600 --> 00:01:47.610 
little groove doesn't line up with that

00:01:47.610 --> 00:01:50.179 
little groove doesn't line up with that
little<00:01:48.180> metal<00:01:48.450> ward<00:01:48.840> and<00:01:49.170> I<00:01:49.560> try<00:01:49.740> to<00:01:49.770> turn<00:01:50.009> it

00:01:50.179 --> 00:01:50.189 
little metal ward and I try to turn it

00:01:50.189 --> 00:01:51.950 
little metal ward and I try to turn it
of<00:01:50.310> course<00:01:50.460> it<00:01:50.670> can't<00:01:50.909> that<00:01:51.149> little<00:01:51.390> metal<00:01:51.570> the

00:01:51.950 --> 00:01:51.960 
of course it can't that little metal the

00:01:51.960 --> 00:01:55.819 
of course it can't that little metal the
ward<00:01:52.170> will<00:01:52.500> stop<00:01:53.040> it<00:01:53.280> from<00:01:53.579> rotating<00:01:54.649> now<00:01:55.649> one

00:01:55.819 --> 00:01:55.829 
ward will stop it from rotating now one

00:01:55.829 --> 00:01:57.440 
ward will stop it from rotating now one
of<00:01:55.860> the<00:01:56.009> things<00:01:56.250> about<00:01:56.490> these<00:01:56.700> old<00:01:56.909> locks<00:01:57.149> is

00:01:57.440 --> 00:01:57.450 
of the things about these old locks is

00:01:57.450 --> 00:01:59.630 
of the things about these old locks is
that<00:01:57.719> they're<00:01:58.290> all<00:01:58.409> actuated<00:01:59.009> from<00:01:59.310> the<00:01:59.430> top

00:01:59.630 --> 00:01:59.640 
that they're all actuated from the top

00:01:59.640 --> 00:02:01.550 
that they're all actuated from the top
just<00:02:00.270> like<00:02:00.509> modern<00:02:00.780> locks<00:02:01.110> just<00:02:01.320> like<00:02:01.530> a

00:02:01.550 --> 00:02:01.560 
just like modern locks just like a

00:02:01.560 --> 00:02:03.050 
just like modern locks just like a
master<00:02:02.009> lock<00:02:02.159> I<00:02:02.310> think<00:02:02.549> you've<00:02:02.670> seen<00:02:02.880> those

00:02:03.050 --> 00:02:03.060 
master lock I think you've seen those

00:02:03.060 --> 00:02:05.510 
master lock I think you've seen those
where<00:02:03.299> you<00:02:03.360> their<00:02:04.140> spring<00:02:04.500> actuated<00:02:05.280> and

00:02:05.510 --> 00:02:05.520 
where you their spring actuated and

00:02:05.520 --> 00:02:08.059 
where you their spring actuated and
you'll<00:02:05.610> pull<00:02:05.880> the<00:02:06.030> actuator<00:02:06.420> back<00:02:07.069> through

00:02:08.059 --> 00:02:08.069 
you'll pull the actuator back through

00:02:08.069 --> 00:02:09.830 
you'll pull the actuator back through
some<00:02:08.280> action<00:02:08.670> on<00:02:08.759> the<00:02:08.849> top<00:02:09.030> and<00:02:09.270> then<00:02:09.690> of

00:02:09.830 --> 00:02:09.840 
some action on the top and then of

00:02:09.840 --> 00:02:12.530 
some action on the top and then of
course<00:02:09.899> the<00:02:10.259> hasp<00:02:10.470> opens<00:02:11.180> these<00:02:12.180> work<00:02:12.360> the

00:02:12.530 --> 00:02:12.540 
course the hasp opens these work the

00:02:12.540 --> 00:02:13.460 
course the hasp opens these work the
same<00:02:12.750> way

00:02:13.460 --> 00:02:13.470 
same way

00:02:13.470 --> 00:02:15.350 
same way
all<00:02:14.190> of<00:02:14.400> these<00:02:14.520> wars<00:02:14.760> are<00:02:14.970> totally

00:02:15.350 --> 00:02:15.360 
all of these wars are totally

00:02:15.360 --> 00:02:17.480 
all of these wars are totally
unnecessary<00:02:15.480> the<00:02:16.410> only<00:02:16.710> part<00:02:16.950> that<00:02:17.160> actuates

00:02:17.480 --> 00:02:17.490 
unnecessary the only part that actuates

00:02:17.490 --> 00:02:20.270 
unnecessary the only part that actuates
this<00:02:17.880> lock<00:02:18.120> is<00:02:18.690> usually<00:02:19.230> the<00:02:19.350> very<00:02:19.530> tip<00:02:19.980> of<00:02:20.010> it

00:02:20.270 --> 00:02:20.280 
this lock is usually the very tip of it

00:02:20.280 --> 00:02:23.330 
this lock is usually the very tip of it
so<00:02:20.820> if<00:02:21.810> we<00:02:21.990> want<00:02:22.170> to<00:02:22.230> bypass<00:02:22.410> all<00:02:22.980> of<00:02:23.280> the

00:02:23.330 --> 00:02:23.340 
so if we want to bypass all of the

00:02:23.340 --> 00:02:25.640 
so if we want to bypass all of the
security<00:02:23.640> measures<00:02:24.090> of<00:02:24.240> these<00:02:24.360> old<00:02:24.570> locks<00:02:24.810> you

00:02:25.640 --> 00:02:25.650 
security measures of these old locks you

00:02:25.650 --> 00:02:27.920 
security measures of these old locks you
can<00:02:25.680> simply<00:02:26.160> remove<00:02:26.430> all<00:02:27.000> of<00:02:27.300> this<00:02:27.450> border<00:02:27.810> you

00:02:27.920 --> 00:02:27.930 
can simply remove all of this border you

00:02:27.930 --> 00:02:30.170 
can simply remove all of this border you
file<00:02:28.260> it<00:02:28.440> off<00:02:28.590> so<00:02:28.890> you<00:02:28.950> have<00:02:29.100> a<00:02:29.130> thin<00:02:29.490> shaft<00:02:29.790> and

00:02:30.170 --> 00:02:30.180 
file it off so you have a thin shaft and

00:02:30.180 --> 00:02:32.210 
file it off so you have a thin shaft and
then<00:02:30.750> you<00:02:30.870> have<00:02:31.020> the<00:02:31.140> actuator<00:02:31.650> and<00:02:31.920> a<00:02:32.040> lot<00:02:32.190> of

00:02:32.210 --> 00:02:32.220 
then you have the actuator and a lot of

00:02:32.220 --> 00:02:33.710 
then you have the actuator and a lot of
the<00:02:32.370> old<00:02:32.490> railroad<00:02:32.700> guys<00:02:33.060> did<00:02:33.330> that<00:02:33.570> they

00:02:33.710 --> 00:02:33.720 
the old railroad guys did that they

00:02:33.720 --> 00:02:35.060 
the old railroad guys did that they
didn't<00:02:33.900> want<00:02:34.020> to<00:02:34.050> carry<00:02:34.260> around<00:02:34.410> a<00:02:34.590> ring<00:02:34.830> of

00:02:35.060 --> 00:02:35.070 
didn't want to carry around a ring of

00:02:35.070 --> 00:02:36.680 
didn't want to carry around a ring of
you<00:02:35.280> know<00:02:35.400> fifty<00:02:35.820> or<00:02:35.940> hundred<00:02:35.970> of<00:02:36.300> these<00:02:36.360> keys

00:02:36.680 --> 00:02:36.690 
you know fifty or hundred of these keys

00:02:36.690 --> 00:02:38.420 
you know fifty or hundred of these keys
because<00:02:37.320> all<00:02:37.470> the<00:02:37.590> switches<00:02:37.800> of<00:02:38.040> course<00:02:38.220> we're

00:02:38.420 --> 00:02:38.430 
because all the switches of course we're

00:02:38.430 --> 00:02:40.760 
because all the switches of course we're
different<00:02:38.730> so<00:02:38.940> they<00:02:39.840> just<00:02:40.050> file<00:02:40.260> it<00:02:40.470> all<00:02:40.590> off

00:02:40.760 --> 00:02:40.770 
different so they just file it all off

00:02:40.770 --> 00:02:43.850 
different so they just file it all off
and<00:02:40.980> they<00:02:41.040> just<00:02:41.190> had<00:02:41.370> one<00:02:41.550> actuator<00:02:42.320> now<00:02:43.320> this

00:02:43.850 --> 00:02:43.860 
and they just had one actuator now this

00:02:43.860 --> 00:02:46.400 
and they just had one actuator now this
might<00:02:44.100> look<00:02:44.130> strikingly<00:02:45.120> familiar<00:02:45.410> to

00:02:46.400 --> 00:02:46.410 
might look strikingly familiar to

00:02:46.410 --> 00:02:47.930 
might look strikingly familiar to
something<00:02:46.920> I<00:02:46.980> think<00:02:47.040> most<00:02:47.340> of<00:02:47.520> you<00:02:47.640> have<00:02:47.670> seen

00:02:47.930 --> 00:02:47.940 
something I think most of you have seen

00:02:47.940 --> 00:02:52.280 
something I think most of you have seen
before<00:02:48.120> and<00:02:48.570> that<00:02:48.710> would<00:02:49.710> be<00:02:50.780> the<00:02:51.780> skeleton

00:02:52.280 --> 00:02:52.290 
before and that would be the skeleton

00:02:52.290 --> 00:02:54.830 
before and that would be the skeleton
picks<00:02:52.560> is<00:02:53.490> a<00:02:53.850> bypass<00:02:54.330> tool

00:02:54.830 --> 00:02:54.840 
picks is a bypass tool

00:02:54.840 --> 00:02:57.140 
picks is a bypass tool
these<00:02:55.050> these<00:02:55.620> are<00:02:55.680> pickable<00:02:56.340> in<00:02:56.490> fact<00:02:56.820> they

00:02:57.140 --> 00:02:57.150 
these these are pickable in fact they

00:02:57.150 --> 00:02:58.670 
these these are pickable in fact they
give<00:02:57.390> you<00:02:57.540> a<00:02:57.570> pick<00:02:57.900> if<00:02:58.140> none<00:02:58.440> of<00:02:58.470> these

00:02:58.670 --> 00:02:58.680 
give you a pick if none of these

00:02:58.680 --> 00:03:01.400 
give you a pick if none of these
skeleton<00:02:59.220> keys<00:02:59.430> work<00:02:59.700> you<00:03:00.600> can<00:03:00.780> still<00:03:00.900> pick<00:03:01.200> it

00:03:01.400 --> 00:03:01.410 
skeleton keys work you can still pick it

00:03:01.410 --> 00:03:03.740 
skeleton keys work you can still pick it
using<00:03:01.740> this<00:03:01.890> one<00:03:02.100> on<00:03:02.220> the<00:03:02.400> end<00:03:02.430> but<00:03:03.330> hopefully

using this one on the end but hopefully

00:03:03.750 --> 00:03:05.530 
using this one on the end but hopefully
they'll<00:03:03.930> work<00:03:04.110> and<00:03:04.350> in<00:03:04.680> my<00:03:04.830> experience<00:03:05.310> about

they'll work and in my experience about

00:03:05.540 --> 00:03:09.230 
they'll work and in my experience about
about<00:03:06.540> ninety<00:03:06.990> percent<00:03:07.020> of<00:03:07.470> them<00:03:07.620> do<00:03:08.180> now<00:03:09.180> for

00:03:09.230 --> 00:03:09.240 
about ninety percent of them do now for

about ninety percent of them do now for
the<00:03:09.540> or<00:03:09.780> even<00:03:09.960> higher<00:03:11.180> for<00:03:12.180> the<00:03:12.270> sake<00:03:12.450> of

small<00:03:14.580> they<00:03:14.820> come<00:03:15.000> in<00:03:15.120> two<00:03:15.270> sizes<00:03:15.480> you<00:03:15.930> have

00:03:16.070 --> 00:03:16.080 
small they come in two sizes you have

00:03:16.080 --> 00:03:19.070 
small they come in two sizes you have
the<00:03:16.230> small<00:03:16.500> and<00:03:17.160> I<00:03:17.250> use<00:03:18.180> that<00:03:18.390> term<00:03:18.600> based<00:03:18.900> on

00:03:19.070 --> 00:03:19.080 
the small and I use that term based on

00:03:19.080 --> 00:03:21.110 
the small and I use that term based on
the<00:03:19.260> width<00:03:19.500> of<00:03:19.770> the<00:03:19.950> tip<00:03:20.190> so<00:03:20.910> you<00:03:20.970> have<00:03:21.060> the

00:03:21.110 --> 00:03:21.120 
the width of the tip so you have the

00:03:21.120 --> 00:03:23.090 
the width of the tip so you have the
small<00:03:21.390> single<00:03:21.870> actuator<00:03:22.350> and<00:03:22.650> the<00:03:22.830> small

small single actuator and the small
double<00:03:23.489> actuator<00:03:23.940> and<00:03:24.120> those<00:03:24.209> are<00:03:24.390> the<00:03:24.480> two

00:03:24.650 --> 00:03:24.660 
double actuator and those are the two

most common and almost all of these
skeletal<00:03:27.360> locks<00:03:27.540> and<00:03:27.810> then<00:03:28.470> we<00:03:28.560> have<00:03:28.680> the<00:03:28.800> seen

00:03:28.970 --> 00:03:28.980 
skeletal locks and then we have the seen

00:03:28.980 --> 00:03:30.920 
skeletal locks and then we have the seen
the<00:03:29.190> larger<00:03:29.550> one<00:03:29.700> so<00:03:29.970> the<00:03:30.120> large<00:03:30.360> single<00:03:30.780> and

00:03:30.920 --> 00:03:30.930 
the larger one so the large single and

00:03:30.930 --> 00:03:32.620 
the larger one so the large single and
the<00:03:30.989> large<00:03:31.200> double<00:03:31.380> and<00:03:31.739> of<00:03:31.860> course<00:03:32.100> the<00:03:32.310> pic

00:03:32.620 --> 00:03:32.630 
the large double and of course the pic

00:03:32.630 --> 00:03:35.000 
the large double and of course the pic
now<00:03:33.630> before<00:03:33.989> somebody<00:03:34.290> sends<00:03:34.590> a<00:03:34.650> question

00:03:35.000 --> 00:03:35.010 
now before somebody sends a question

now before somebody sends a question
this<00:03:35.760> one<00:03:36.000> on<00:03:36.090> the<00:03:36.209> bottom<00:03:36.330> I<00:03:36.600> made<00:03:36.810> this<00:03:36.989> one

00:03:37.220 --> 00:03:37.230 
this one on the bottom I made this one

00:03:37.230 --> 00:03:39.140 
this one on the bottom I made this one
and<00:03:37.320> that's<00:03:37.470> really<00:03:37.680> to<00:03:37.920> open<00:03:38.130> like<00:03:38.610> suitcase

00:03:39.140 --> 00:03:39.150 
and that's really to open like suitcase

00:03:39.150 --> 00:03:41.360 
and that's really to open like suitcase
and<00:03:39.420> briefcases<00:03:39.870> but<00:03:40.650> again<00:03:40.830> if<00:03:40.950> it's<00:03:41.070> awarded

00:03:41.360 --> 00:03:41.370 
and briefcases but again if it's awarded

lock this opens literally a hundred
percent<00:03:43.560> of<00:03:43.920> them<00:03:44.100> so<00:03:44.700> these<00:03:44.790> are<00:03:44.940> pretty

00:03:45.050 --> 00:03:45.060 
percent of them so these are pretty

00:03:45.060 --> 00:03:47.630 
percent of them so these are pretty
simple<00:03:45.360> mechanisms<00:03:46.310> first<00:03:47.310> I'll<00:03:47.459> show<00:03:47.519> you

know<00:03:55.709> how<00:03:55.860> well<00:03:56.010> you<00:03:56.040> can<00:03:56.100> make<00:03:56.340> that<00:03:56.519> out<00:03:56.550> but

00:03:57.040 --> 00:03:57.050 
know how well you can make that out but

00:03:57.050 --> 00:03:59.320 
know how well you can make that out but

the<00:04:18.989> law<00:04:19.109> does<00:04:19.470> work<00:04:19.709> and<00:04:20.190> is<00:04:20.900> wonderful

the law does work and is wonderful

the law does work and is wonderful
mechanism<00:04:22.560> really<00:04:22.710> reliable<00:04:23.370> this<00:04:23.520> is

00:04:23.630 --> 00:04:23.640 
mechanism really reliable this is

00:04:23.640 --> 00:04:25.140 
mechanism really reliable this is
probably<00:04:23.970> close<00:04:24.240> to

00:04:25.140 --> 00:04:25.150 
probably close to

probably close to
I'm<00:04:25.419> 80<00:04:25.750> years<00:04:25.870> old<00:04:26.199> it'd<00:04:26.410> be<00:04:26.500> my<00:04:26.650> guest<00:04:27.100> again

00:04:27.570 --> 00:04:27.580 
I'm 80 years old it'd be my guest again

00:04:27.580 --> 00:04:30.450 
I'm 80 years old it'd be my guest again
that's<00:04:28.030> purely<00:04:28.300> I<00:04:28.419> guess<00:04:29.010> okay<00:04:30.010> if<00:04:30.070> I<00:04:30.160> look<00:04:30.340> at

00:04:30.450 --> 00:04:30.460 
that's purely I guess okay if I look at

00:04:30.460 --> 00:04:33.600 
that's purely I guess okay if I look at
the<00:04:30.580> actuator<00:04:31.500> and<00:04:32.500> I<00:04:32.650> want<00:04:32.889> to<00:04:32.980> use<00:04:33.220> one<00:04:33.580> of

00:04:33.600 --> 00:04:33.610 
the actuator and I want to use one of

00:04:33.610 --> 00:04:37.170 
the actuator and I want to use one of
these<00:04:33.790> bypass<00:04:34.270> tools<00:04:34.830> we<00:04:35.830> could<00:04:35.979> guess<00:04:36.250> but

00:04:37.170 --> 00:04:37.180 
these bypass tools we could guess but

00:04:37.180 --> 00:04:39.689 
these bypass tools we could guess but
you<00:04:37.660> can<00:04:37.840> use<00:04:38.380> an<00:04:38.500> educated<00:04:38.919> guess<00:04:39.190> and<00:04:39.460> the

00:04:39.689 --> 00:04:39.699 
you can use an educated guess and the

00:04:39.699 --> 00:04:41.280 
you can use an educated guess and the
way<00:04:39.820> I<00:04:39.850> decide<00:04:40.240> which<00:04:40.449> of<00:04:40.510> these<00:04:40.780> five<00:04:40.990> tools

00:04:41.280 --> 00:04:41.290 
way I decide which of these five tools

00:04:41.290 --> 00:04:43.500 
way I decide which of these five tools
to<00:04:41.530> use<00:04:41.710> is<00:04:41.979> I<00:04:42.070> simply<00:04:42.430> look<00:04:42.850> at<00:04:42.940> the<00:04:43.090> keyway

00:04:43.500 --> 00:04:43.510 
to use is I simply look at the keyway

00:04:43.510 --> 00:04:46.379 
to use is I simply look at the keyway
and<00:04:43.780> I<00:04:44.740> place<00:04:45.220> the<00:04:45.400> key<00:04:45.580> next<00:04:45.850> to<00:04:45.970> it<00:04:46.150> and<00:04:46.330> this

00:04:46.379 --> 00:04:46.389 
and I place the key next to it and this

00:04:46.389 --> 00:04:48.810 
and I place the key next to it and this
would<00:04:46.570> be<00:04:46.720> the<00:04:46.930> small<00:04:47.260> double<00:04:47.800> actuator<00:04:48.250> and

00:04:48.810 --> 00:04:48.820 
would be the small double actuator and

00:04:48.820 --> 00:04:50.040 
would be the small double actuator and
you'll<00:04:49.030> notice<00:04:49.300> that<00:04:49.479> there's<00:04:49.720> a<00:04:49.810> lot<00:04:49.960> of

00:04:50.040 --> 00:04:50.050 
you'll notice that there's a lot of

00:04:50.050 --> 00:04:52.620 
you'll notice that there's a lot of
extra<00:04:50.350> room<00:04:50.380> there<00:04:50.560> so<00:04:51.010> right<00:04:51.940> away<00:04:52.090> I'm<00:04:52.510> going

00:04:52.620 --> 00:04:52.630 
extra room there so right away I'm going

00:04:52.630 --> 00:04:54.210 
extra room there so right away I'm going
to<00:04:52.720> put<00:04:52.840> the<00:04:52.960> largest<00:04:53.229> pick<00:04:53.620> in<00:04:53.800> there<00:04:53.979> that<00:04:54.160> I

00:04:54.210 --> 00:04:54.220 
to put the largest pick in there that I

00:04:54.220 --> 00:04:57.330 
to put the largest pick in there that I
can<00:04:54.280> fit<00:04:54.639> to<00:04:55.000> reach<00:04:55.210> those<00:04:55.660> actuators<00:04:56.440> so

00:04:57.330 --> 00:04:57.340 
can fit to reach those actuators so

00:04:57.340 --> 00:04:59.010 
can fit to reach those actuators so
there's<00:04:57.610> the<00:04:57.820> double<00:04:58.150> and<00:04:58.270> you<00:04:58.330> can<00:04:58.479> see<00:04:58.630> if<00:04:58.900> I

00:04:59.010 --> 00:04:59.020 
there's the double and you can see if I

00:04:59.020 --> 00:05:01.230 
there's the double and you can see if I
can<00:04:59.200> squeeze<00:04:59.410> that<00:04:59.680> in<00:04:59.860> there<00:04:59.889> and<00:05:00.250> that<00:05:00.280> might

00:05:01.230 --> 00:05:01.240 
can squeeze that in there and that might

00:05:01.240 --> 00:05:03.120 
can squeeze that in there and that might
be<00:05:01.270> a<00:05:01.419> good<00:05:01.660> choice<00:05:01.870> so<00:05:02.380> I<00:05:02.650> always<00:05:02.889> like<00:05:03.100> to

00:05:03.120 --> 00:05:03.130 
be a good choice so I always like to

00:05:03.130 --> 00:05:04.920 
be a good choice so I always like to
start<00:05:03.490> with<00:05:03.610> a<00:05:03.669> double<00:05:04.120> because<00:05:04.330> that<00:05:04.570> means<00:05:04.690> I

00:05:04.920 --> 00:05:04.930 
start with a double because that means I

00:05:04.930 --> 00:05:07.370 
start with a double because that means I
don't<00:05:05.260> have<00:05:05.380> to<00:05:05.470> mess<00:05:05.800> around<00:05:05.919> too<00:05:06.340> much<00:05:06.639> I

00:05:07.370 --> 00:05:07.380 
don't have to mess around too much I

00:05:07.380 --> 00:05:09.960 
don't have to mess around too much I
have<00:05:08.380> a<00:05:08.410> better<00:05:08.620> chance<00:05:08.710> and<00:05:09.280> these<00:05:09.580> really

00:05:09.960 --> 00:05:09.970 
have a better chance and these really

00:05:09.970 --> 00:05:12.600 
have a better chance and these really
are<00:05:10.090> the<00:05:10.419> most<00:05:11.380> successful<00:05:11.950> ones<00:05:12.100> the<00:05:12.280> double

00:05:12.600 --> 00:05:12.610 
are the most successful ones the double

00:05:12.610 --> 00:05:14.550 
are the most successful ones the double
though<00:05:12.760> the<00:05:12.910> singles<00:05:13.270> you<00:05:13.510> just<00:05:14.139> put<00:05:14.320> in<00:05:14.410> there

00:05:14.550 --> 00:05:14.560 
though the singles you just put in there

00:05:14.560 --> 00:05:16.409 
though the singles you just put in there
now<00:05:14.680> it<00:05:14.919> won't<00:05:15.040> be<00:05:15.220> a<00:05:15.250> perfect<00:05:15.520> fit<00:05:16.000> so<00:05:16.210> you<00:05:16.300> may

00:05:16.409 --> 00:05:16.419 
now it won't be a perfect fit so you may

00:05:16.419 --> 00:05:17.580 
now it won't be a perfect fit so you may
have<00:05:16.539> to<00:05:16.660> jiggle<00:05:16.960> it<00:05:17.020> around<00:05:17.080> but<00:05:17.470> you'll

00:05:17.580 --> 00:05:17.590 
have to jiggle it around but you'll

00:05:17.590 --> 00:05:19.740 
have to jiggle it around but you'll
eventually<00:05:17.740> find<00:05:18.340> a<00:05:18.520> spring<00:05:18.789> tension<00:05:19.510> and<00:05:19.660> as

00:05:19.740 --> 00:05:19.750 
eventually find a spring tension and as

00:05:19.750 --> 00:05:23.250 
eventually find a spring tension and as
soon<00:05:19.900> as<00:05:20.020> you<00:05:20.110> turn<00:05:20.350> it<00:05:22.080> it<00:05:23.080> will<00:05:23.229> work

00:05:23.250 --> 00:05:23.260 
soon as you turn it it will work

00:05:23.260 --> 00:05:27.420 
soon as you turn it it will work
perfectly<00:05:23.440> so<00:05:24.870> this<00:05:25.870> really<00:05:26.410> old<00:05:26.710> lock<00:05:26.979> at<00:05:27.250> one

00:05:27.420 --> 00:05:27.430 
perfectly so this really old lock at one

00:05:27.430 --> 00:05:29.460 
perfectly so this really old lock at one
time<00:05:27.669> was<00:05:27.940> the<00:05:28.090> state<00:05:28.330> of<00:05:28.360> the<00:05:28.510> art<00:05:28.750> insecurity

00:05:29.460 --> 00:05:29.470 
time was the state of the art insecurity

00:05:29.470 --> 00:05:31.740 
time was the state of the art insecurity
and<00:05:29.710> yet<00:05:29.860> today<00:05:30.010> we<00:05:30.460> all<00:05:30.610> have<00:05:30.820> access<00:05:31.000> for<00:05:31.539> to

00:05:31.740 --> 00:05:31.750 
and yet today we all have access for to

00:05:31.750 --> 00:05:35.270 
and yet today we all have access for to
a<00:05:31.780> very<00:05:32.160> cheap<00:05:33.160> set<00:05:33.700> of<00:05:33.820> bypass<00:05:34.360> skeleton<00:05:34.900> keys

00:05:35.270 --> 00:05:35.280 
a very cheap set of bypass skeleton keys

00:05:35.280 --> 00:05:39.180 
a very cheap set of bypass skeleton keys
that<00:05:36.280> can<00:05:37.270> defeat<00:05:37.780> them<00:05:37.990> all<00:05:38.169> so<00:05:38.560> I<00:05:38.770> guess<00:05:39.039> that

00:05:39.180 --> 00:05:39.190 
that can defeat them all so I guess that

00:05:39.190 --> 00:05:41.550 
that can defeat them all so I guess that
explains<00:05:39.280> why<00:05:39.729> we<00:05:39.880> moved<00:05:40.030> onto<00:05:40.380> medicos<00:05:41.380> and

00:05:41.550 --> 00:05:41.560 
explains why we moved onto medicos and

00:05:41.560 --> 00:05:44.070 
explains why we moved onto medicos and
at<00:05:41.650> Boise<00:05:42.150> anyway<00:05:43.150> it<00:05:43.270> is<00:05:43.389> a<00:05:43.419> cool<00:05:43.630> old<00:05:43.870> lock

00:05:44.070 --> 00:05:44.080 
at Boise anyway it is a cool old lock

00:05:44.080 --> 00:05:45.089 
at Boise anyway it is a cool old lock
and<00:05:44.320> I<00:05:44.349> thought<00:05:44.500> I<00:05:44.560> spent<00:05:44.800> a<00:05:44.860> few<00:05:44.979> minutes

00:05:45.089 --> 00:05:45.099 
and I thought I spent a few minutes

00:05:45.099 --> 00:05:45.990 
and I thought I spent a few minutes
talking<00:05:45.280> about<00:05:45.610> it

00:05:45.990 --> 00:05:46.000 
talking about it

00:05:46.000 --> 00:05:48.180 
talking about it
thank<00:05:46.599> you<00:05:46.750> for<00:05:46.870> your<00:05:46.960> time<00:05:47.200> everybody<00:05:47.680> stay
