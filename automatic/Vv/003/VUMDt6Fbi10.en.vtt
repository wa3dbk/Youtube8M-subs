00:00:03.080 --> 00:00:08.040
 hello everyone welcome on the channel 

00:00:05.250 --> 00:00:10.469
 techno recharge his smartphone or these 

00:00:08.040 --> 00:00:11.880
 electronic devices without cable it's 

00:00:10.469 --> 00:00:13.380
 possible it's called charging by 

00:00:11.880 --> 00:00:13.679
 induction we talk a lot about it 

00:00:13.380 --> 00:00:15.540
 moment 

00:00:13.679 --> 00:00:18.170
 so how does it work what are the 

00:00:15.540 --> 00:00:18.170
 advantages and disadvantages 

00:00:24.910 --> 00:00:30.380
 with buyster the mobile is used to pay 

00:00:28.519 --> 00:00:32.629
 register now on 

00:00:30.380 --> 00:00:35.629
 low-land point fr and bought on 

00:00:32.629 --> 00:00:36.920
 internet in all serenity to show 

00:00:35.629 --> 00:00:38.870
 what is truly recharging by 

00:00:36.920 --> 00:00:40.579
 induction look at these pictures a 

00:00:38.870 --> 00:00:42.920
 smartphone that you ask yourself on a 

00:00:40.579 --> 00:00:45.199
 small cushion and cebo automatically 

00:00:42.920 --> 00:00:47.900
 you see it the battery goes into 

00:00:45.199 --> 00:00:49.489
 charge and this to his son it's magic 

00:00:47.900 --> 00:00:51.320
 yeah finally magic not quite 

00:00:49.489 --> 00:00:54.170
 because obviously when we raise this 

00:00:51.320 --> 00:00:55.699
 even to j2m disappointment when we 

00:00:54.170 --> 00:00:56.300
 raises the small cushion case a son 

00:00:55.699 --> 00:00:58.219
 below 

00:00:56.300 --> 00:01:00.050
 obviously actually recharging by 

00:00:58.219 --> 00:01:01.609
 electromagnetic induction what is it 

00:01:00.050 --> 00:01:03.199
 well these are two electric coils 

00:01:01.609 --> 00:01:05.899
 who when approaching them comes to 

00:01:03.199 --> 00:01:07.670
 exchange currents without having 

00:01:05.899 --> 00:01:08.899
 need to physically connect to cable 

00:01:07.670 --> 00:01:11.330
 look at these pictures as we 

00:01:08.899 --> 00:01:13.220
 planes taken at the ifa of which there are 

00:01:11.330 --> 00:01:15.259
 a few weeks of that in berlin it's 

00:01:13.220 --> 00:01:16.910
 Panasonic which showed that this blender 

00:01:15.259 --> 00:01:19.399
 in fact it was simply working 

00:01:16.910 --> 00:01:20.990
 the imposing on a large plate and there 

00:01:19.399 --> 00:01:22.940
 it was induction too here is a 

00:01:20.990 --> 00:01:23.960
 electric mixer that no longer needs to 

00:01:22.940 --> 00:01:24.830
 wire to the leg 

00:01:23.960 --> 00:01:26.990
 a magical thing also it's the 

00:01:24.830 --> 00:01:28.939
 television ah yes so that was the 

00:01:26.990 --> 00:01:31.040
 Chinese constructor haier and this 

00:01:28.939 --> 00:01:32.869
 demonstration already two years ago 

00:01:31.040 --> 00:01:34.280
 to the las vegas announcements and he told us 

00:01:32.869 --> 00:01:36.380
 represents each time every time 

00:01:34.280 --> 00:01:38.180
 with a miniaturized system again 

00:01:36.380 --> 00:01:40.640
 a television that works without any 

00:01:38.180 --> 00:01:42.470
 wire at a time to feed video 

00:01:40.640 --> 00:01:44.000
 but also for food 

00:01:42.470 --> 00:01:45.740
 electric it's true it's 

00:01:44.000 --> 00:01:47.420
 completely magical that then it's very 

00:01:45.740 --> 00:01:48.770
 seducing all this is especially as 

00:01:47.420 --> 00:01:49.939
 you know it well today these are 

00:01:48.770 --> 00:01:53.570
 mobile phones that are 

00:01:49.939 --> 00:01:56.270
 concerned with it was said the smartphone 

00:01:53.570 --> 00:01:58.640
 samsung galaxy s iii which was one 

00:01:56.270 --> 00:02:00.350
 first to be announced with a 

00:01:58.640 --> 00:02:02.119
 induction search system then 

00:02:00.350 --> 00:02:03.469
 in fact it is not yet 

00:02:02.119 --> 00:02:03.890
 quite available it happens it goes 

00:02:03.469 --> 00:02:05.509
 happen to you 

00:02:03.890 --> 00:02:06.619
 it is an accessory as an accessory 

00:02:05.509 --> 00:02:07.670
 it's good but optional and when you say 

00:02:06.619 --> 00:02:08.780
 that it was one of the first is not 

00:02:07.670 --> 00:02:11.290
 quite the case since let's remember 

00:02:08.780 --> 00:02:13.900
 it's true the palm pre 

00:02:11.290 --> 00:02:15.700
 of fire this brand palm no longer exists 

00:02:13.900 --> 00:02:16.870
 unfortunately and well this palm pre who 

00:02:15.700 --> 00:02:19.109
 was a very promising phone 

00:02:16.870 --> 00:02:21.459
 just prometheus proof this 

00:02:19.109 --> 00:02:22.510
 feature there again a little 

00:02:21.459 --> 00:02:23.980
 accessory that allowed you to 

00:02:22.510 --> 00:02:27.099
 charge your phone by induction 

00:02:23.980 --> 00:02:29.079
 mollard good his part that failed to 

00:02:27.099 --> 00:02:32.109
 bring happiness to not tomorrow this 

00:02:29.079 --> 00:02:34.030
 technology the wolf 1920 it has been said already 

00:02:32.109 --> 00:02:35.439
 on the techno channel will be able to recharge 

00:02:34.030 --> 00:02:37.810
 like that by induction and then his little 

00:02:35.439 --> 00:02:39.220
 brother the 820 it will be available 

00:02:37.810 --> 00:02:40.480
 also in the form of options there 

00:02:39.220 --> 00:02:42.459
 just change the back shell 

00:02:40.480 --> 00:02:44.799
 in short, it's something that will be generalized 

00:02:42.459 --> 00:02:46.530
 the iphone 5 on the other hand does not have 

00:02:44.799 --> 00:02:48.519
 induction charging we have enough 

00:02:46.530 --> 00:02:50.739
 lamented this absence because 

00:02:48.519 --> 00:02:52.930
 obviously the induction charging and 

00:02:50.739 --> 00:02:54.790
 although we say that this is the future that is 

00:02:52.930 --> 00:02:55.689
 the future so good nothing prevents you 

00:02:54.790 --> 00:02:57.069
 also turn your phone 

00:02:55.689 --> 00:02:58.629
 any phone 

00:02:57.069 --> 00:02:59.709
 finally not any phone mail 

00:02:58.629 --> 00:03:02.290
 and phone still pretty common 

00:02:59.709 --> 00:03:04.090
 in induction charging because it 

00:03:02.290 --> 00:03:06.129
 today there are builders who 

00:03:04.090 --> 00:03:08.739
 offers you kits with both a 

00:03:06.129 --> 00:03:10.000
 kind of small pedestal on which you 

00:03:08.739 --> 00:03:12.970
 go put the phone but that's it 

00:03:10.000 --> 00:03:14.500
 it's a plaque and then a little 

00:03:12.970 --> 00:03:17.440
 shell you to insert them into your 

00:03:14.500 --> 00:03:18.549
 phone and who will allow him so 

00:03:17.440 --> 00:03:19.750
 to work to do before their 

00:03:18.549 --> 00:03:20.739
 phone in the name hull does not appear 

00:03:19.750 --> 00:03:22.239
 duction then the problem is that 

00:03:20.739 --> 00:03:24.099
 it's not very beautiful now 

00:03:22.239 --> 00:03:25.150
 magnify your phone right away 

00:03:24.099 --> 00:03:26.680
 looks like you have a kind of 

00:03:25.150 --> 00:03:28.180
 big turtle in the pocket it's not 

00:03:26.680 --> 00:03:29.680
 given no more low it costs 

00:03:28.180 --> 00:03:31.150
 easily several tens of euros 

00:03:29.680 --> 00:03:33.940
 is not far from helping 100 euros 

00:03:31.150 --> 00:03:35.310
 between the hull and the charger so everything 

00:03:33.940 --> 00:03:37.449
 this is still enough 

00:03:35.310 --> 00:03:39.549
 experimental and in addition the recharge by 

00:03:37.449 --> 00:03:41.470
 induction actually is present 

00:03:39.549 --> 00:03:44.620
 some disadvantages franÃ§ois yes 

00:03:41.470 --> 00:03:46.449
 so bath the paradox is that despite 

00:03:44.620 --> 00:03:47.650
 all the same if when you reload 

00:03:46.449 --> 00:03:49.389
 your phone you do not have any wires 

00:03:47.650 --> 00:03:51.190
 well you still need yarns yes 

00:03:49.389 --> 00:03:53.319
 because your little one your little base 

00:03:51.190 --> 00:03:55.299
 induction is going to be obligatorily 

00:03:53.319 --> 00:03:57.040
 plugged in the current so he'll have to 

00:03:55.299 --> 00:03:57.699
 a catch nearby is magic 

00:03:57.040 --> 00:03:59.739
 magic 

00:03:57.699 --> 00:04:01.090
 and then have a disadvantage if you 

00:03:59.739 --> 00:04:02.500
 recharge your smartphone so 

00:04:01.090 --> 00:04:02.739
 traditional with cable plug 

00:04:02.500 --> 00:04:03.970
 above 

00:04:02.739 --> 00:04:05.500
 yes you can still catch the 

00:04:03.970 --> 00:04:07.509
 phone to call yes or for 

00:04:05.500 --> 00:04:09.340
 go on the internet to surf 

00:04:07.509 --> 00:04:10.900
 serve to use api in ten 

00:04:09.340 --> 00:04:13.090
 classes you have to leave it flat on 

00:04:10.900 --> 00:04:14.530
 its charger when they are a cushion 

00:04:13.090 --> 00:04:17.530
 or not a cushion tick 

00:04:14.530 --> 00:04:19.840
 Well it's not very practical then we 

00:04:17.530 --> 00:04:20.949
 said it's a bit expensive 

00:04:19.840 --> 00:04:22.600
 in any case when it comes under 

00:04:20.949 --> 00:04:23.500
 accessory form and blow when 

00:04:22.600 --> 00:04:25.570
 it's built into the phones 

00:04:23.500 --> 00:04:26.669
 necessarily it helps to increase a 

00:04:25.570 --> 00:04:28.780
 little bit too 

00:04:26.669 --> 00:04:30.520
 it's longer the recharge is more 

00:04:28.780 --> 00:04:32.620
 long as that is what we will we 

00:04:30.520 --> 00:04:34.419
 can not today equal the 

00:04:32.620 --> 00:04:35.889
 recharge rate with a son so 

00:04:34.419 --> 00:04:37.479
 induction works but it's more 

00:04:35.889 --> 00:04:40.090
 long and then the problem he expects 

00:04:37.479 --> 00:04:41.470
 finally there is that it is that well he 

00:04:40.090 --> 00:04:42.699
 there is a loss of energy but in 

00:04:41.470 --> 00:04:43.870
 do it that's also why it's 

00:04:42.699 --> 00:04:45.880
 longer is because the performance 

00:04:43.870 --> 00:04:49.479
 is not very very good so in fact 

00:04:45.880 --> 00:04:51.100
 you're going to consume some ben a 

00:04:49.479 --> 00:04:51.910
 certain amount of energy at the level of 

00:04:51.100 --> 00:04:54.430
 your electrical outlet 

00:04:51.910 --> 00:04:55.750
 but it will take more than usual 

00:04:54.430 --> 00:04:57.460
 to charge your smartphone so 

00:04:55.750 --> 00:04:59.169
 it's not very economical at this stage is 

00:04:57.460 --> 00:05:00.700
 nice would be ecological either and we 

00:04:59.169 --> 00:05:02.889
 will have a lot of economy 

00:05:00.700 --> 00:05:04.300
 energy and well there obviously has 

00:05:02.889 --> 00:05:06.250
 not yet really at the corner at 

00:05:04.300 --> 00:05:08.080
 point to finish jÃ©rÃ´me there is 

00:05:06.250 --> 00:05:09.070
 two standards to add one more 

00:05:08.080 --> 00:05:10.120
 layer that is to say that today it 

00:05:09.070 --> 00:05:12.070
 there is not only one standard standard 

00:05:10.120 --> 00:05:13.900
 regarding induction there are two 

00:05:12.070 --> 00:05:16.450
 that's kind of the problem we'd like to 

00:05:13.900 --> 00:05:18.250
 term no longer have any thread and then 

00:05:16.450 --> 00:05:19.750
 for example to see at home only one 

00:05:18.250 --> 00:05:20.470
 plate like that on which we would put 

00:05:19.750 --> 00:05:22.570
 all devices 

00:05:20.470 --> 00:05:23.740
 whatever their brand and whatever 

00:05:22.570 --> 00:05:25.960
 be their type a toothbrush a 

00:05:23.740 --> 00:05:27.910
 smartphone unfortunately you said it 

00:05:25.960 --> 00:05:31.660
 standards the first is called schiele 

00:05:27.910 --> 00:05:33.729
 logos and qi like that which is led by 

00:05:31.660 --> 00:05:34.900
 energizer and then manufacturers of 

00:05:33.729 --> 00:05:36.340
 phones and then there is another 

00:05:34.900 --> 00:05:38.919
 standard that are trying to make room for 

00:05:36.340 --> 00:05:40.300
 sun too, which is led by 

00:05:38.919 --> 00:05:41.169
 competing brands including the brand 

00:05:40.300 --> 00:05:44.910
 Duracell batteries 

00:05:41.169 --> 00:05:47.320
 so that's not really 

00:05:44.910 --> 00:05:49.090
 uniformity at the level of the refill 

00:05:47.320 --> 00:05:51.039
 by induction it goes ahead but 

00:05:49.090 --> 00:05:51.430
 we will have to wait a few more 

00:05:51.039 --> 00:05:52.479
 month 

00:05:51.430 --> 00:05:53.770
 that's what we read on the 

00:05:52.479 --> 00:05:55.330
 load to the adduction and we end up 

00:05:53.770 --> 00:05:57.990
 tomorrow of course on the techno channel 

00:05:55.330 --> 00:05:57.990
 Hi everybody
