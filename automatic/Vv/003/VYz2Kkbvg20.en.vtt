00:00:03.690 --> 00:00:08.980
 Hello, today I want to share 

00:00:06.610 --> 00:00:12.910
 growing experience 

00:00:08.980 --> 00:00:19.109
 early on vitamin namely onion onion abbot 

00:00:12.910 --> 00:00:22.089
 on the rim the mind does not give head but he 

00:00:19.109 --> 00:00:24.699
 is all seasons greens possible 

00:00:22.089 --> 00:00:28.449
 collect all season and its most valuable 

00:00:24.699 --> 00:00:32.470
 the green is of course before spring here on 

00:00:28.449 --> 00:00:36.160
 before March 22 the bow looks like this 

00:00:32.470 --> 00:00:42.129
 that's it here who planted the past 

00:00:36.160 --> 00:00:45.820
 in the autumn is also the most important thing when 

00:00:42.129 --> 00:00:48.160
 no more greenery in the chorus in principle he is not 

00:00:45.820 --> 00:00:52.030
 afraid of frost and its greens can 

00:00:48.160 --> 00:00:56.230
 collect all winter this wash which is like 

00:00:52.030 --> 00:01:00.969
 would have grown land saved earth is 

00:00:56.230 --> 00:01:03.370
 Onions I have a bed specially 

00:01:00.969 --> 00:01:09.329
 planted these elementary between flowers 

00:01:03.370 --> 00:01:12.460
 little club kick here in spring 

00:01:09.329 --> 00:01:16.420
 this bow can be well and best of all it 

00:01:12.460 --> 00:01:18.310

00:01:16.420 --> 00:01:21.399
 spring can be planted with each 

00:01:18.310 --> 00:01:24.369
 Onions will turn bush plant 

00:01:21.399 --> 00:01:26.619
 stems and dig sit snatch 

00:01:24.369 --> 00:01:28.960
 its with stems is not necessary because well 

00:01:26.619 --> 00:01:30.189
 so breeding is still very good 

00:01:28.960 --> 00:01:33.969
 way of reproduction 

00:01:30.189 --> 00:01:37.360
 This is it all summer shooters if not 

00:01:33.969 --> 00:01:39.280

00:01:37.360 --> 00:01:40.149

00:01:48.820 --> 00:01:54.610

00:01:52.000 --> 00:01:58.240

00:01:58.240 --> 00:02:04.329

00:02:12.819 --> 00:02:16.970
 bulbs get a separate course 

00:02:14.990 --> 00:02:19.490
 but if they do not bury her 

00:02:16.970 --> 00:02:23.630
