00:00:01.510 --> 00:00:13.690
 Good evening, I'm watering Today I will share Korean related news 

00:00:06.910 --> 00:00:21.530
 You should apologize for the place where this title should be apologized to meet Masahiro Nakai in the Japan-Korea issue. 

00:00:13.690 --> 00:00:27.830
 Childish remarks in the morning to speak and criticize on the net, but this Fuji TV 

00:00:21.530 --> 00:00:31.850
 Well, this is called Widena Show, but it's a fairly popular program 

00:00:27.830 --> 00:00:37.220
 So Well Nakai-kun It is of smap Anou 

00:00:31.850 --> 00:00:38.350
 It sells like saying that what should be apologized should be wrong, but this is really a mistake 

00:00:37.220 --> 00:00:41.350
 Right 

00:00:38.350 --> 00:00:45.700
 Why are you up to this age of 41 ? 

00:00:41.350 --> 00:00:51.510
 I think I would say such a foolish thing 

00:00:45.700 --> 00:00:53.280
 So far, Japan has been apologizing well and even with the Japan-Korea Basic Treaty 

00:00:51.510 --> 00:00:56.020
 It is over, isn't it? 

00:00:53.280 --> 00:01:00.970
 I think I think that it is resolved 

00:00:56.020 --> 00:01:05.659
 I think it's a bit too shallow that it should be wrong if it is another thing 

00:01:00.970 --> 00:01:13.009
 It is not really a statement of this 40-year-old man 

00:01:05.659 --> 00:01:16.280
 And those who said that the Japan-Korea relationship is more than that of topix and the Japan-Korea relationship is bad 

00:01:13.009 --> 00:01:22.490
 Though it is said that Japan 87% 

00:01:16.280 --> 00:01:25.650
 Well, I used to explain it in my video before, but I really said that Japan-Korea relationship 

00:01:22.490 --> 00:01:29.310
 Takeshima's Forbidden Occupied Aftertunes Statue 

00:01:25.650 --> 00:01:30.010
 My head is still stealing and then 

00:01:29.310 --> 00:01:32.850
 Hey you 

00:01:30.010 --> 00:01:36.320
 Pak Yue 's Babaa 

00:01:32.850 --> 00:01:40.990
 I liked that joke I is Toka blame 1000 years 

00:01:36.320 --> 00:01:44.470
 It's still a bit like September and I have a look 

00:01:40.990 --> 00:01:45.570
 Better of two persons of the day that month and SeiOkoshi tomb 

00:01:44.470 --> 00:01:52.600
 What 

00:01:45.570 --> 00:01:54.980
 That's where you went to Takeshima, and it is a place where you have been deceived by the Emperor. 

00:01:52.600 --> 00:02:00.390
 Because such a thing is done 

00:01:54.980 --> 00:02:06.070
 Has become commonplace that Tteyuu another Anti-Korean sentiment boom in Japan 

00:02:00.390 --> 00:02:08.640
 After all it is non-Korean three yuan, but I can not help but not help 

00:02:06.070 --> 00:02:15.360
 It is becoming that principle 

00:02:08.640 --> 00:02:20.910
 Really I think you know the Tteyuu Vocational'm childish idea Toka shoulder chest in shallow knowledge really 

00:02:15.360 --> 00:02:22.260
 Position I'm in I say not apologize because do I Apologize place should apologize Japan anymore 

00:02:20.910 --> 00:02:28.349

00:02:41.010 --> 00:02:44.340
 Japan tv stationer 

00:02:42.280 --> 00:02:46.860
 Though I think a good invite 

00:02:44.340 --> 00:02:51.700
 It is anti-Japanese national Korea 

00:02:46.860 --> 00:02:53.280
 Those stupid people are tv stations in Japan 

00:02:51.700 --> 00:02:58.340
 TV program 

00:02:53.280 --> 00:03:03.920
 It is a little opposite to perform appearances, and it is also about the Yasukuni issue 

00:02:58.340 --> 00:03:07.150
 Korean loan always bites and it is only true anti-Japanese 

00:03:03.920 --> 00:03:10.510
 In You know Uma that is this program 

00:03:07.150 --> 00:03:15.939

 So I safe do you think I think Well I wonder if be allowed that way, such remarks 

00:03:42.050 --> 00:03:53.270
 Look at this article because it is from Korea 

00:03:46.370 --> 00:03:56.750
 Well, also it's a not criticize a decent person I Well Nakai-kun is the Japanese 

00:03:53.270 --> 00:03:59.740
 Some Koreans in Japan 

00:03:56.750 --> 00:04:03.520
 Also often in Japan 

00:03:59.740 --> 00:04:08.350
 Korean Koreans Naturalized Japanese people 

00:04:03.520 --> 00:04:14.110
 It remarks that Nakai-kun has a modal in the correct something like that 

00:04:08.350 --> 00:04:18.019
 But it is about to put out its name in real Mochotto waiting for this time Make a note
