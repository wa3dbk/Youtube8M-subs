regular school because i like to party
and<00:01:24.479> whatnot<00:01:24.930> so<00:01:25.759> yeah<00:01:26.759> just<00:01:27.210> pretty<00:01:27.450> much<00:01:27.600> the

00:01:27.710 --> 00:01:27.720 
and whatnot so yeah just pretty much the

00:01:27.720 --> 00:01:31.310 
and whatnot so yeah just pretty much the
structure<00:01:28.170> the<00:01:29.009> military<00:01:29.850> college<00:01:30.540> they<00:01:30.900> have

00:01:31.310 --> 00:01:31.320 
structure the military college they have

00:01:31.320 --> 00:01:32.870 
structure the military college they have
more<00:01:31.470> discipline<00:01:31.950> they<00:01:32.100> can't<00:01:32.310> go<00:01:32.460> out<00:01:32.670> as

00:01:32.870 --> 00:01:32.880 
more discipline they can't go out as

00:01:32.880 --> 00:01:35.179 
more discipline they can't go out as
much<00:01:33.060> as<00:01:33.360> regular<00:01:34.049> students<00:01:34.650> you<00:01:34.920> know<00:01:35.009> they

00:01:35.179 --> 00:01:35.189 
much as regular students you know they

00:01:35.189 --> 00:01:36.499 
much as regular students you know they
can't<00:01:35.400> go<00:01:35.490> to<00:01:35.520> dinner<00:01:35.790> with<00:01:35.880> their<00:01:36.090> friends<00:01:36.270> so

00:01:36.499 --> 00:01:36.509 
can't go to dinner with their friends so

00:01:36.509 --> 00:01:37.850 
can't go to dinner with their friends so
they<00:01:36.600> definitely<00:01:36.869> have<00:01:37.079> more<00:01:37.320> time<00:01:37.530> to<00:01:37.680> study

00:01:37.850 --> 00:01:37.860 
they definitely have more time to study

00:01:37.860 --> 00:01:40.340 
they definitely have more time to study
and<00:01:38.130> it's<00:01:38.220> more<00:01:38.430> structured<00:01:38.970> but<00:01:39.720> part<00:01:40.200> of<00:01:40.259> the

00:01:40.340 --> 00:01:40.350 
and it's more structured but part of the

00:01:40.350 --> 00:01:42.490 
and it's more structured but part of the
disadvantage<00:01:40.979> of<00:01:41.100> that<00:01:41.280> i<00:01:41.310> think<00:01:41.579> is<00:01:41.909> that

00:01:42.490 --> 00:01:42.500 
disadvantage of that i think is that

00:01:42.500 --> 00:01:45.469 
disadvantage of that i think is that
they<00:01:43.500> don't<00:01:43.710> learn<00:01:43.890> to<00:01:44.189> juggle<00:01:44.430> a<00:01:44.880> social<00:01:45.360> life

00:01:45.469 --> 00:01:45.479 
they don't learn to juggle a social life

00:01:45.479 --> 00:01:46.760 
they don't learn to juggle a social life
along<00:01:45.899> with<00:01:45.930> score<00:01:46.409> along<00:01:46.710> with

00:01:46.760 --> 00:01:46.770 
along with score along with

00:01:46.770 --> 00:01:48.440 
along with score along with
extracurriculars<00:01:47.610> the<00:01:47.759> way<00:01:47.880> we<00:01:48.119> do<00:01:48.240> because

00:01:48.440 --> 00:01:48.450 
extracurriculars the way we do because

00:01:48.450 --> 00:01:49.940 
extracurriculars the way we do because
their<00:01:48.689> life<00:01:48.840> is<00:01:49.020> so<00:01:49.259> structured<00:01:49.710> but<00:01:49.890> i

00:01:49.940 --> 00:01:49.950 
their life is so structured but i

00:01:49.950 --> 00:01:51.560 
their life is so structured but i
definitely<00:01:50.220> think<00:01:50.549> they<00:01:51.030> learn<00:01:51.240> the

00:01:51.560 --> 00:01:51.570 
definitely think they learn the

00:01:51.570 --> 00:01:52.670 
definitely think they learn the
discipline<00:01:52.110> that<00:01:52.259> we<00:01:52.409> don't<00:01:52.530> necessarily

00:01:52.670 --> 00:01:52.680 
discipline that we don't necessarily

00:01:52.680 --> 00:01:54.620 
discipline that we don't necessarily

to<00:02:39.640> making<00:02:39.850> the<00:02:40.000> right<00:02:40.150> decision<00:02:40.600> because

00:02:40.680 --> 00:02:40.690 
to making the right decision because

00:02:40.690 --> 00:02:42.870

00:02:42.870 --> 00:02:42.880 
they had a force department so they

00:02:42.880 --> 00:02:44.490 
they had a force department so they
wouldn't<00:02:43.450> maybe<00:02:43.900> make<00:02:44.140> as<00:02:44.290> many<00:02:44.410> mistakes

00:02:44.490 --> 00:02:44.500 
wouldn't maybe make as many mistakes

00:02:44.500 --> 00:02:47.010
