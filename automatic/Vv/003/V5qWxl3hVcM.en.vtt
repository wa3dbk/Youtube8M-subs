00:03:22.920 --> 00:03:26.900 
ahead and bleach it first that's why I
have<00:03:23.250> it<00:03:23.489> on<00:03:24.480> the<00:03:25.140> hanger<00:03:25.590> and<00:03:26.130> I<00:03:26.670> actually

00:03:26.900 --> 00:03:26.910 
have it on the hanger and I actually

00:03:26.910 --> 00:03:30.680 
have it on the hanger and I actually
filled<00:03:27.870> the<00:03:28.350> West<00:03:28.680> I<00:03:29.070> always<00:03:29.610> feel<00:03:30.150> my<00:03:30.360> webs

00:03:30.680 --> 00:03:30.690 
filled the West I always feel my webs

00:03:30.690 --> 00:03:34.100 
filled the West I always feel my webs
and<00:03:31.079> then<00:03:31.920> I<00:03:32.070> go<00:03:32.310> in<00:03:32.579> and<00:03:32.940> I<00:03:33.120> cut<00:03:33.450> the<00:03:33.600> returns

00:03:34.100 --> 00:03:34.110 
and then I go in and I cut the returns

00:03:34.110 --> 00:03:36.830 
and then I go in and I cut the returns
because<00:03:35.070> if<00:03:35.310> you<00:03:35.459> don't<00:03:35.760> cut<00:03:36.209> the<00:03:36.390> returns

00:03:36.830 --> 00:03:36.840 
because if you don't cut the returns

00:03:36.840 --> 00:03:39.410 
because if you don't cut the returns
even<00:03:37.350> though<00:03:37.530> they're<00:03:37.739> about<00:03:37.980> an<00:03:38.160> inch<00:03:38.420> the

00:03:39.410 --> 00:03:39.420 
even though they're about an inch the

00:03:39.420 --> 00:03:41.509 
even though they're about an inch the
hair<00:03:39.690> will<00:03:39.840> still<00:03:40.200> tangle<00:03:40.709> at<00:03:40.799> the<00:03:40.950> end<00:03:41.130> so<00:03:41.400> you

00:03:41.509 --> 00:03:41.519 
hair will still tangle at the end so you

00:03:41.519 --> 00:03:43.880 
hair will still tangle at the end so you
always<00:03:41.730> want<00:03:41.910> to<00:03:42.299> seal<00:03:42.630> your<00:03:42.870> West<00:03:43.170> with<00:03:43.620> some

always want to seal your West with some
type<00:03:44.070> of<00:03:44.100> seal<00:03:44.489> or<00:03:44.730> you<00:03:44.910> can<00:03:45.060> either<00:03:45.269> use<00:03:46.040> nail

00:03:47.030 --> 00:03:47.040 
type of seal or you can either use nail

00:03:47.040 --> 00:03:49.970 
type of seal or you can either use nail
