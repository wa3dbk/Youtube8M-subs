00:00:00.860 --> 00:00:05.860
Hey, hey welcome to the second film for modification of drone Syma X5C.

00:00:06.680 --> 00:00:08.440
In the second part I will show you 

00:00:08.860 --> 00:00:10.160
how to increase the flight time

00:00:10.660 --> 00:00:13.320
through the purchase of a new, more comprehensive battery. 

00:00:13.760 --> 00:00:14.420
I invite you!

00:00:15.740 --> 00:00:17.020
What do you need?

00:00:17.960 --> 00:00:19.620
- Quadrocopter Syma X5C

00:00:25.320 --> 00:00:27.040
- Small flat-blade screwdriver

00:00:27.840 --> 00:00:32.260
or some other tool. For example, a paper clip or pin.

00:00:38.840 --> 00:00:40.120
- Scissors

00:00:43.100 --> 00:00:45.100
- Electrical tape

00:00:49.460 --> 00:00:51.460
- Original battery

00:00:56.100 --> 00:00:58.100
- New batteries

00:01:09.720 --> 00:01:21.060
I bought a battery company Turnigy Nano-tech 750mAh 1S 35-70C for about $5.

00:01:23.280 --> 00:01:27.920
Do not connect the battery to the drone now, because we burn quadcopter,

00:01:28.880 --> 00:01:32.000
you need to make a change polarity, this will tell later.

00:01:33.860 --> 00:01:36.760
Comparison of a new battery Turnigy 750mAh and 500mAh Syma original.

00:01:48.460 --> 00:01:51.800
Now that's what I said at the beginning, so modification of the battery.

00:01:52.360 --> 00:01:57.160
We take our battery and we need to change cables red with a black spot.

00:01:59.940 --> 00:02:01.940
Red with black, change the polarity (+) and (-).

00:02:04.580 --> 00:02:07.340
Now we take the tool.

00:02:10.140 --> 00:02:12.340
To remove the pin.

00:02:16.300 --> 00:02:20.440
We need to replace the cables as they are in the original battery.

00:02:21.100 --> 00:02:23.680
Red here, and black here.

00:02:24.020 --> 00:02:26.320
As you look at the new battery is exactly the opposite.

00:02:34.880 --> 00:02:39.020
We take a flat screwdriver or any other tool, press that pin.

00:02:42.040 --> 00:02:43.120
and pull the cable.

00:02:48.560 --> 00:02:49.880
With the second cable is the same.

00:02:53.920 --> 00:02:55.920
As you can see I already took out the wires.

00:02:56.540 --> 00:03:01.700
Now we can secure one cable electrical tape so as not to make a short circuit.

00:03:06.260 --> 00:03:09.640
Now replace cables in places, as in the original battery.

00:03:11.260 --> 00:03:12.900
Red left, black on the right.

00:03:22.000 --> 00:03:24.860
Now we take the drone and take off the battery cover.

00:03:29.160 --> 00:03:32.060
Put a new battery and connect.

00:03:38.040 --> 00:03:40.180
As I said a new battery comes close.

00:03:44.275 --> 00:03:46.275
Now assume the battery cover.

00:03:59.600 --> 00:04:01.360
Check to see if it works.

00:04:11.680 --> 00:04:12.880
As you can see it works.

00:04:13.580 --> 00:04:16.960
The flight time in comparison to the original battery increases,

00:04:17.280 --> 00:04:18.444
but the charging time too.

00:04:28.080 --> 00:04:28.840
This is the end. 

00:04:29.160 --> 00:04:30.355
Thanks for watching!

00:04:30.620 --> 00:04:34.200
Subscribe, comment, like it and take care. I invite You to the next part, there will be soon.

00:04:34.500 --> 00:04:36.100
To the next time. Hi.
