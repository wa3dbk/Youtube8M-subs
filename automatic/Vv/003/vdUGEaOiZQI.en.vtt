00:00:09.300 --> 00:00:14.960
 ld today we will learn to ruben 2 frame 

00:00:12.360 --> 00:00:17.450
 x 2 well 

00:00:14.960 --> 00:00:19.340
 something I highly recommend is that 

00:00:17.450 --> 00:00:24.290
 you must know how to solve a rubik cube of 

00:00:19.340 --> 00:00:26.289
 3 x 3 since this cube does not go further 

00:00:24.290 --> 00:00:29.980
 what that cube is 

00:00:26.289 --> 00:00:32.110
 is will we use two of the algorithms 

00:00:29.980 --> 00:00:34.070
 that you already know to be able to solve that 

00:00:32.110 --> 00:00:36.940
 Cube 

00:00:34.070 --> 00:00:39.770
 something you should keep in mind is that 

00:00:36.940 --> 00:00:42.170
 the white color is proof of the contrary 

00:00:39.770 --> 00:00:44.720
 yellow is the color nothing 

00:00:42.170 --> 00:00:47.600
 opposite of the red the blue color to the 

00:00:44.720 --> 00:00:49.489
 opposite of green then you can 

00:00:47.600 --> 00:00:51.960
 start with the face that you like me 

00:00:49.489 --> 00:00:55.640
 I'll start with the white 

00:00:51.960 --> 00:00:55.640
 we proceed to stir 

00:00:55.820 --> 00:01:03.400
 they have our as already scrambled we should 

00:00:59.110 --> 00:01:03.400
 to locate a piece 

00:01:03.490 --> 00:01:09.920
 in this case I look for white sand 

00:01:06.380 --> 00:01:12.770
 this white piece of continuous red and 

00:01:09.920 --> 00:01:16.659
 blue we will proceed to place a piece 

00:01:12.770 --> 00:01:20.399
 that contains white and red 

00:01:16.659 --> 00:01:20.399
 which is this 

00:01:20.520 --> 00:01:26.940
 we can place it in this way 

00:01:24.390 --> 00:01:30.600
 Now we have two pieces well 

00:01:26.940 --> 00:01:34.350
 placed we can see if they are well 

00:01:30.600 --> 00:01:36.710
 placed looking at this part 

00:01:34.350 --> 00:01:39.689
 if the color is consecutive to the previous 

00:01:36.710 --> 00:01:42.020
 it means that we are doing well 

00:01:39.689 --> 00:01:42.020
 things 

00:01:42.550 --> 00:01:48.780
 now we will proceed to place a third 

00:01:45.340 --> 00:01:51.070
 tab which must contain white 

00:01:48.780 --> 00:01:55.800
 blue 

00:01:51.070 --> 00:01:58.580
 which is this blue white 

00:01:55.800 --> 00:01:58.580
 we place 

00:01:58.860 --> 00:02:05.810
 ready we have three well-placed tracks 

00:02:02.300 --> 00:02:05.810
 we will place the last 

00:02:07.380 --> 00:02:14.150
 very well now we have a resolute face 

00:02:14.780 --> 00:02:20.800
 we can see that the colors are 

00:02:18.709 --> 00:02:24.070
 in your order 

00:02:20.800 --> 00:02:26.310
 and obviously this face does not present 

00:02:24.070 --> 00:02:26.310
 alterations 

00:02:27.250 --> 00:02:33.100
 the next step is to stop looking at this 

00:02:29.830 --> 00:02:35.410
 face and put it down 

00:02:33.100 --> 00:02:39.270
 we will not look at this face anymore because 

00:02:35.410 --> 00:02:39.270
 is resolved and would have no case 

00:02:39.720 --> 00:02:42.410
 now 

00:02:42.540 --> 00:02:48.689
 my recommendation is always to look for a 

00:02:45.269 --> 00:02:50.970
 piece that has yellow color in 

00:02:48.689 --> 00:02:53.440
 this case 

00:02:50.970 --> 00:02:56.290
 upwards 

00:02:53.440 --> 00:02:57.820
 I have two to choose from in this case 

00:02:56.290 --> 00:03:00.820
 this has already been positioned in the 

00:02:57.820 --> 00:03:02.470
 place that I have was positioning in its 

00:03:00.820 --> 00:03:05.290
 place 

00:03:02.470 --> 00:03:07.750
 very well here is where we will start with 

00:03:05.290 --> 00:03:09.190
 the first algorithm which is the 

00:03:07.750 --> 00:03:10.690
 following 

00:03:09.190 --> 00:03:12.520
 or 

00:03:10.690 --> 00:03:15.330
 r 

00:03:12.520 --> 00:03:15.330
 press 

00:03:15.540 --> 00:03:18.950
 l prima 

00:03:17.510 --> 00:03:23.030
 i 

00:03:18.950 --> 00:03:24.550
 r premium your premium 

00:03:23.030 --> 00:03:26.060
 l 

00:03:24.550 --> 00:03:29.030
 all right 

00:03:26.060 --> 00:03:32.540
 we can see that this piece has been 

00:03:29.030 --> 00:03:36.459
 stayed fixed and these three have rotated 

00:03:32.540 --> 00:03:36.459
 they are no longer in the same order 

00:03:36.790 --> 00:03:44.230
 with this movement we will obtain 

00:03:40.209 --> 00:03:47.530
 two pieces in place either in this 

00:03:44.230 --> 00:03:49.190
 case or in this case any of the 

00:03:47.530 --> 00:03:51.800
 two is correct 

00:03:49.190 --> 00:03:54.140
 you can only get to get all 

00:03:51.800 --> 00:03:55.990
 instead if you are very lucky with 

00:03:54.140 --> 00:03:58.010
 this movement 

00:03:55.990 --> 00:04:00.180
 otherwise 

00:03:58.010 --> 00:04:03.690
 you must continue 

00:04:00.180 --> 00:04:06.380
 watching those two pieces 

00:04:03.690 --> 00:04:06.380
 now 

00:04:06.870 --> 00:04:12.180
 we will rotate all the pieces that are not 

00:04:09.810 --> 00:04:14.489
 they contained in yellow upwards already 

00:04:12.180 --> 00:04:15.950
 that what we are looking for is a weapon of 

00:04:14.489 --> 00:04:17.530
 this face 

00:04:15.950 --> 00:04:19.570
 all right 

00:04:17.530 --> 00:04:24.450
 for that we will use the following 

00:04:19.570 --> 00:04:26.260
 algorithm which is r premium 

00:04:24.450 --> 00:04:27.790
 of premium 

00:04:26.260 --> 00:04:29.540
 r 

00:04:27.790 --> 00:04:32.990
 d 

00:04:29.540 --> 00:04:34.590
 r premium of pin 

00:04:32.990 --> 00:04:39.490
 er 

00:04:34.590 --> 00:04:43.300
 from ready we stop 

00:04:39.490 --> 00:04:48.120
 because we already have the piece up 

00:04:43.300 --> 00:04:51.180
 as we were looking for we proceed to turn 

00:04:48.120 --> 00:04:54.060
 here take special care in 

00:04:51.180 --> 00:04:56.900
 just turn this layer on as it 

00:04:54.060 --> 00:05:00.320
 they can easily confuse and 

00:04:56.900 --> 00:05:02.979
 stir the cube now we continue with 

00:05:00.320 --> 00:05:02.979
 the same algorithm 

00:05:11.360 --> 00:05:16.300
 and ready we finished 

00:05:14.710 --> 00:05:19.470
 all right 

00:05:16.300 --> 00:05:22.210
 we proceed to put the pieces back 

00:05:19.470 --> 00:05:24.800
 sometimes in its place as it had already 

00:05:22.210 --> 00:05:28.510
 mentioned will only be two 

00:05:24.800 --> 00:05:32.990
 in this case they stayed that way 

00:05:28.510 --> 00:05:35.810
 this can be termed as parity 

00:05:32.990 --> 00:05:39.240
 where, no matter how much we do the 

00:05:35.810 --> 00:05:41.880
 algorithm that I have taught them 

00:05:39.240 --> 00:05:45.210
 they will not stop being like this always 

00:05:41.880 --> 00:05:48.419
 we will have two pieces that are in 

00:05:45.210 --> 00:05:51.320
 wrong places for this there is a 

00:05:48.419 --> 00:05:55.640
 movement which 

00:05:51.320 --> 00:05:57.260
 if you have the case where are you in 

00:05:55.640 --> 00:06:01.940
 place to stay these two that place 

00:05:57.260 --> 00:06:05.460
 they stay like this you will have to do it twice 

00:06:01.940 --> 00:06:08.910
 if you have this case only once 

00:06:05.460 --> 00:06:10.729
 now the algorithm is the next r 

00:06:08.910 --> 00:06:16.210
 everyone 

00:06:10.729 --> 00:06:16.210
 you suppress your cousin r2 

00:06:17.440 --> 00:06:30.240
 The premium and premium or premium the ready has 

00:06:25.810 --> 00:06:30.240
 solved the game two by two 

00:06:30.940 --> 00:06:37.960
 very good in this case 

00:06:34.300 --> 00:06:42.639
 If you have found the case in 

00:06:37.960 --> 00:06:45.220
 where a piece is together with this other 

00:06:42.639 --> 00:06:46.629
 piece and those slabs are wrong you should 

00:06:45.220 --> 00:06:49.129
 of repeating the same algorithm 

00:06:46.629 --> 00:06:52.249
 as 

00:06:49.129 --> 00:06:55.660
 you will have come to this again 

00:06:52.249 --> 00:06:59.040
 you repeat the algorithm again 

00:06:55.660 --> 00:06:59.040
 and you how is it solved 

00:07:00.409 --> 00:07:05.389
 then if you have any doubt 

00:07:02.959 --> 00:07:08.500
 please place it in the section of 

00:07:05.389 --> 00:07:11.220
 comments and I will respond as soon as possible 

00:07:08.500 --> 00:07:11.220
 Thank you
