because<00:01:00.620> it<00:01:00.739> does<00:01:00.980> indeed<00:01:01.190> work<00:01:01.339> open<00:01:02.059> 8.1

00:01:02.709 --> 00:01:02.719 
because it does indeed work open 8.1

00:01:02.719 --> 00:01:04.150 
because it does indeed work open 8.1
it'll<00:01:02.989> probably<00:01:03.230> work<00:01:03.379> for<00:01:03.739> a<00:01:03.769> really<00:01:04.129> long

00:01:04.150 --> 00:01:04.160 
it'll probably work for a really long

00:01:04.160 --> 00:01:06.040 
it'll probably work for a really long
time<00:01:04.339> because<00:01:04.820> it's<00:01:05.030> hard<00:01:05.269> to<00:01:05.390> fix<00:01:05.570> these<00:01:05.720> kind

00:01:06.040 --> 00:01:06.050 
time because it's hard to fix these kind

00:01:06.050 --> 00:01:09.400 
time because it's hard to fix these kind
