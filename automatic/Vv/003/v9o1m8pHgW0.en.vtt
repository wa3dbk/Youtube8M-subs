00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.190
 Sneakers me by the way when mom 

00:00:03.480 --> 00:00:08.460
 slipped and fell into the fire and and 

00:00:05.190 --> 00:00:09.540
 I burned all my legs there with you 

00:00:08.460 --> 00:00:12.599
 Two arms 

00:00:09.540 --> 00:00:17.690
 calmly said that Lenchik 

00:00:12.599 --> 00:00:17.690
 that everything will be fine that I am not a timber 

00:00:19.320 --> 00:00:22.970
 very exciting 

00:00:39.060 --> 00:00:45.300
 she has a very bad upward see feeling 

00:00:42.870 --> 00:00:48.290
 that the floor began to dance 

00:00:45.300 --> 00:00:48.290
 after exactly 

00:00:59.079 --> 00:01:03.190
 u like for the ncap project before step it 

00:01:01.059 --> 00:01:06.390
 copes but of course they do not have time 

00:01:03.190 --> 00:01:06.390
 work on each other 

00:01:07.890 --> 00:01:12.229
 strange that in this pair he is better than she 

00:01:15.000 --> 00:01:17.840
 how beautiful it was 

00:01:25.120 --> 00:01:27.210
 Well 

00:01:30.250 --> 00:01:34.410
 I like my partner more or less 

00:01:31.990 --> 00:01:34.410
 strange 

00:01:34.480 --> 00:01:39.350
 more confident 

00:01:35.460 --> 00:01:39.350
 but his image is hunting 

00:01:44.890 --> 00:01:52.780
 I panicked the truth without rewards and 

00:01:48.409 --> 00:01:52.780
 created absorbers reliable support 

00:01:56.020 --> 00:02:04.189
 when the dim games i start with you this 

00:02:02.209 --> 00:02:05.959
 was very sure it was very 

00:02:04.189 --> 00:02:08.239
 like a man yes where it is missing may 

00:02:05.959 --> 00:02:10.849
 be lines but for break dance paradise 

00:02:08.239 --> 00:02:14.540
 consider the result to be absolutely phenomenal 

00:02:10.849 --> 00:02:17.440
 and from this point of view I want to praise 

00:02:14.540 --> 00:02:20.540
 Lena who chose such a partner 

00:02:17.440 --> 00:02:22.880
 but as for you, allen was visible 

00:02:20.540 --> 00:02:25.370
 fear in the eyes that was visible panic 

00:02:22.880 --> 00:02:28.790
 we expected some kind of places from you 

00:02:25.370 --> 00:02:32.180
 bigger and guys since we are still 

00:02:28.790 --> 00:02:35.500
 we value the pair as a whole your general verdict 

00:02:32.180 --> 00:02:38.750
 you will find out a little later 

00:02:35.500 --> 00:02:41.350
