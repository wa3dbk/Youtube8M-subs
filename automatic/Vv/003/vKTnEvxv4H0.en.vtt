I<00:00:02.620> kind<00:00:03.610> of<00:00:03.699> mentioned<00:00:03.909> I'm<00:00:04.060> from<00:00:04.180> Brazil

00:00:04.260 --> 00:00:04.270 
I kind of mentioned I'm from Brazil

00:00:04.270 --> 00:00:05.670 
I kind of mentioned I'm from Brazil
originally<00:00:04.779> I'll<00:00:04.899> do<00:00:05.050> these<00:00:05.170> interviews<00:00:05.350> back

00:00:05.670 --> 00:00:05.680 
originally I'll do these interviews back

00:00:05.680 --> 00:00:07.200 
originally I'll do these interviews back
home<00:00:05.920> where<00:00:06.160> like<00:00:06.310> entrepreneurship<00:00:07.060> is

00:00:07.200 --> 00:00:07.210 
home where like entrepreneurship is

00:00:07.210 --> 00:00:08.490 
home where like entrepreneurship is
still<00:00:07.390> like<00:00:07.509> a<00:00:07.540> build-up<00:00:07.960> process<00:00:08.350> like<00:00:08.469> a

00:00:08.490 --> 00:00:08.500 
still like a build-up process like a

00:00:08.500 --> 00:00:10.140 
still like a build-up process like a
building<00:00:08.920> process<00:00:09.340> and<00:00:09.520> like<00:00:09.639> it's<00:00:09.969> not<00:00:10.059> as

00:00:10.140 --> 00:00:10.150 
building process and like it's not as

00:00:10.150 --> 00:00:11.370 
building process and like it's not as
much<00:00:10.299> in<00:00:10.420> the<00:00:10.510> culture<00:00:10.780> as<00:00:10.870> it<00:00:11.050> here<00:00:11.260> in<00:00:11.320> the

00:00:11.370 --> 00:00:11.380 
much in the culture as it here in the

00:00:11.380 --> 00:00:12.660 
much in the culture as it here in the
valley<00:00:11.500> and<00:00:11.679> they<00:00:11.769> always<00:00:11.920> ask<00:00:12.010> me<00:00:12.190> like<00:00:12.219> when

00:00:12.660 --> 00:00:12.670 
valley and they always ask me like when

00:00:12.670 --> 00:00:14.040 
valley and they always ask me like when
do<00:00:12.730> you<00:00:12.790> have<00:00:12.940> your<00:00:13.120> idea<00:00:13.389> like<00:00:13.630> what<00:00:13.780> a<00:00:13.809> great

00:00:14.040 --> 00:00:14.050 
do you have your idea like what a great

00:00:14.050 --> 00:00:16.019 
do you have your idea like what a great
idea<00:00:14.170> you<00:00:14.440> guys<00:00:14.559> have<00:00:14.620> like<00:00:14.830> what<00:00:15.639> struck<00:00:15.910> you

00:00:16.019 --> 00:00:16.029 
idea you guys have like what struck you

00:00:16.029 --> 00:00:17.790 
idea you guys have like what struck you
guys<00:00:16.209> and<00:00:16.480> there<00:00:16.810> was<00:00:16.930> no<00:00:17.110> one<00:00:17.140> moment<00:00:17.680> we're

00:00:17.790 --> 00:00:17.800 
guys and there was no one moment we're

00:00:17.800 --> 00:00:19.980 
guys and there was no one moment we're
like<00:00:17.980> oh<00:00:18.130> yeah<00:00:18.730> like<00:00:19.090> photos<00:00:19.480> with<00:00:19.660> filters

00:00:19.980 --> 00:00:19.990 
like oh yeah like photos with filters

00:00:19.990 --> 00:00:23.130 
like oh yeah like photos with filters
and<00:00:20.230> ideas<00:00:21.070> really<00:00:21.400> are<00:00:21.699> the<00:00:22.060> result<00:00:22.660> of<00:00:22.779> a<00:00:22.900> lot

00:00:23.130 --> 00:00:23.140 
and ideas really are the result of a lot

00:00:23.140 --> 00:00:24.750 
and ideas really are the result of a lot
of<00:00:23.320> these<00:00:23.470> iteration<00:00:24.010> steps<00:00:24.460> that<00:00:24.640> we've

00:00:24.750 --> 00:00:24.760 
of these iteration steps that we've

00:00:24.760 --> 00:00:26.400 
of these iteration steps that we've
talked<00:00:24.939> about<00:00:25.090> earlier<00:00:25.480> and<00:00:25.720> your<00:00:26.170> job<00:00:26.380> is

00:00:26.400 --> 00:00:26.410 
talked about earlier and your job is

00:00:26.410 --> 00:00:28.259 
talked about earlier and your job is
just<00:00:26.619> to<00:00:26.710> explore<00:00:27.070> the<00:00:27.250> solution<00:00:27.609> space<00:00:27.789> until

00:00:28.259 --> 00:00:28.269 
just to explore the solution space until

00:00:28.269 --> 00:00:29.759 
just to explore the solution space until
you<00:00:28.449> figure<00:00:28.750> it<00:00:28.810> out<00:00:28.930> we're<00:00:29.170> in<00:00:29.349> that<00:00:29.470> solution

00:00:29.759 --> 00:00:29.769 
you figure it out we're in that solution

00:00:29.769 --> 00:00:32.250 
you figure it out we're in that solution
space<00:00:30.070> you<00:00:30.279> fit<00:00:30.490> and<00:00:30.670> it<00:00:30.820> turns<00:00:31.000> out<00:00:31.260> people

00:00:32.250 --> 00:00:32.260 
space you fit and it turns out people

00:00:32.260 --> 00:00:34.350 
space you fit and it turns out people
are<00:00:32.349> always<00:00:32.470> like<00:00:32.710> well<00:00:33.220> like<00:00:33.489> does<00:00:34.030> my<00:00:34.150> idea

00:00:34.350 --> 00:00:34.360 
are always like well like does my idea

00:00:34.360 --> 00:00:35.520 
are always like well like does my idea
need<00:00:34.510> to<00:00:34.570> be<00:00:34.660> the<00:00:34.750> most<00:00:34.840> like<00:00:35.050> unique<00:00:35.260> thing<00:00:35.469> in

00:00:35.520 --> 00:00:35.530 
need to be the most like unique thing in

00:00:35.530 --> 00:00:37.200 
need to be the most like unique thing in
the<00:00:35.590> world<00:00:35.739> nowadays<00:00:36.550> especially<00:00:36.730> in<00:00:37.149> the

00:00:37.200 --> 00:00:37.210 
the world nowadays especially in the

00:00:37.210 --> 00:00:39.060 
the world nowadays especially in the
social<00:00:37.540> space<00:00:37.630> ideas<00:00:38.230> are<00:00:38.290> combinatorial

00:00:39.060 --> 00:00:39.070 
social space ideas are combinatorial

00:00:39.070 --> 00:00:40.889 
social space ideas are combinatorial
right<00:00:39.640> it's<00:00:39.820> a<00:00:39.880> mad<00:00:40.030> like<00:00:40.210> that<00:00:40.420> childhood

00:00:40.889 --> 00:00:40.899 
right it's a mad like that childhood

00:00:40.899 --> 00:00:42.180 
right it's a mad like that childhood
exercise<00:00:41.290> where<00:00:41.500> you<00:00:41.530> take<00:00:41.710> different<00:00:41.890> parts

00:00:42.180 --> 00:00:42.190 
exercise where you take different parts

00:00:42.190 --> 00:00:43.380 
exercise where you take different parts
of<00:00:42.250> the<00:00:42.309> animals<00:00:42.700> and<00:00:42.820> you<00:00:42.879> make<00:00:43.000> a<00:00:43.030> new<00:00:43.239> animal

00:00:43.380 --> 00:00:43.390 
of the animals and you make a new animal

00:00:43.390 --> 00:00:45.030 
of the animals and you make a new animal
out<00:00:43.629> of<00:00:43.780> it<00:00:43.899> that's<00:00:44.230> a<00:00:44.290> lot<00:00:44.350> what<00:00:44.620> startups<00:00:44.890> are

00:00:45.030 --> 00:00:45.040 
out of it that's a lot what startups are

00:00:45.040 --> 00:00:46.530 
out of it that's a lot what startups are
like<00:00:45.190> you're<00:00:45.370> saying<00:00:45.610> like<00:00:45.820> well<00:00:46.270> like

00:00:46.530 --> 00:00:46.540 
like you're saying like well like

00:00:46.540 --> 00:00:48.060 
like you're saying like well like
there's<00:00:46.930> things<00:00:47.110> about<00:00:47.170> Twitter<00:00:47.530> we<00:00:47.710> really

00:00:48.060 --> 00:00:48.070 
there's things about Twitter we really

00:00:48.070 --> 00:00:49.319 
there's things about Twitter we really
like<00:00:48.219> but<00:00:48.340> it<00:00:48.460> frustrates<00:00:48.879> us<00:00:49.000> that<00:00:49.149> we<00:00:49.239> don't

00:00:49.319 --> 00:00:49.329 
like but it frustrates us that we don't

00:00:49.329 --> 00:00:50.520 
like but it frustrates us that we don't
have<00:00:49.510> an<00:00:49.570> emotional<00:00:49.750> connection<00:00:50.020> with<00:00:50.469> the

have an emotional connection with the

00:00:50.530 --> 00:00:52.110 
have an emotional connection with the
content<00:00:50.860> that<00:00:51.010> we're<00:00:51.100> receiving<00:00:51.340> it's<00:00:52.000> not

00:00:52.110 --> 00:00:52.120 
content that we're receiving it's not

00:00:52.120 --> 00:00:54.299 
content that we're receiving it's not
visual<00:00:52.539> you<00:00:52.930> know<00:00:52.960> and<00:00:53.260> there's<00:00:54.039> things<00:00:54.219> we

00:00:54.299 --> 00:00:54.309 
visual you know and there's things we

00:00:54.309 --> 00:00:55.830 
visual you know and there's things we
like<00:00:54.489> about<00:00:54.640> things<00:00:55.000> like<00:00:55.149> hipstamatic<00:00:55.690> would

00:00:55.830 --> 00:00:55.840 
like about things like hipstamatic would

00:00:55.840 --> 00:00:57.150 
like about things like hipstamatic would
like<00:00:55.960> these<00:00:56.110> cool<00:00:56.350> ways<00:00:56.710> of<00:00:56.890> making<00:00:57.100> your

00:00:57.150 --> 00:00:57.160 
like these cool ways of making your

00:00:57.160 --> 00:00:59.130 
like these cool ways of making your
photos<00:00:57.460> look<00:00:57.550> better<00:00:57.730> but<00:00:58.270> the<00:00:58.719> photos<00:00:58.989> get

00:00:59.130 --> 00:00:59.140 
photos look better but the photos get

00:00:59.140 --> 00:01:00.029 
photos look better but the photos get
caught<00:00:59.289> on<00:00:59.410> the<00:00:59.500> phone<00:00:59.680> and<00:00:59.860> they<00:00:59.920> don't

00:01:00.029 --> 00:01:00.039 
caught on the phone and they don't

00:01:00.039 --> 00:01:01.529 
caught on the phone and they don't
really<00:01:00.280> get<00:01:00.370> to<00:01:00.520> like<00:01:00.550> connect<00:01:01.270> with<00:01:01.420> your

00:01:01.529 --> 00:01:01.539 
really get to like connect with your

00:01:01.539 --> 00:01:02.880 
really get to like connect with your
friends<00:01:01.809> through<00:01:01.989> them<00:01:02.109> so<00:01:02.350> these

00:01:02.880 --> 00:01:02.890 
friends through them so these

00:01:02.890 --> 00:01:04.920 
friends through them so these
combinatorial<00:01:03.489> ideas<00:01:03.730> are<00:01:03.850> really<00:01:04.360> where<00:01:04.690> you

00:01:04.920 --> 00:01:04.930 
combinatorial ideas are really where you

00:01:04.930 --> 00:01:08.670 
combinatorial ideas are really where you
end<00:01:05.110> up<00:01:05.199> having<00:01:05.379> these<00:01:05.649> aha<00:01:06.490> moments<00:01:07.680> later

00:01:08.670 --> 00:01:08.680 
end up having these aha moments later

00:01:08.680 --> 00:01:10.140 
end up having these aha moments later
after<00:01:09.189> you've<00:01:09.310> explored<00:01:09.610> the<00:01:09.760> solution<00:01:10.060> space

00:01:10.140 --> 00:01:10.150 
after you've explored the solution space

00:01:10.150 --> 00:01:12.359 
after you've explored the solution space
rather<00:01:10.479> than<00:01:10.630> like<00:01:10.960> the<00:01:11.140> shower<00:01:11.380> idea<00:01:11.770> that

00:01:12.359 --> 00:01:12.369 
rather than like the shower idea that

00:01:12.369 --> 00:01:14.250 
rather than like the shower idea that
ends<00:01:12.640> up<00:01:12.700> like<00:01:13.000> you<00:01:13.570> know<00:01:13.689> killing<00:01:14.020> them<00:01:14.140> and

00:01:14.250 --> 00:01:14.260 
ends up like you know killing them and

00:01:14.260 --> 00:01:16.320 
ends up like you know killing them and
as<00:01:14.350> we've<00:01:14.740> mentioned<00:01:14.860> before<00:01:15.159> in<00:01:15.580> the<00:01:15.970> sharing

00:01:16.320 --> 00:01:16.330 
as we've mentioned before in the sharing

00:01:16.330 --> 00:01:18.030 
as we've mentioned before in the sharing
and<00:01:16.390> discussing<00:01:16.780> process<00:01:17.350> is<00:01:17.530> where<00:01:17.860> those

00:01:18.030 --> 00:01:18.040 
and discussing process is where those

00:01:18.040 --> 00:01:19.920 
and discussing process is where those
ideas<00:01:18.340> get<00:01:18.670> refined<00:01:18.970> so<00:01:19.270> getting<00:01:19.840> that

00:01:19.920 --> 00:01:19.930 
ideas get refined so getting that

00:01:19.930 --> 00:01:21.630 
ideas get refined so getting that
consumer<00:01:20.439> validation<00:01:20.920> going<00:01:21.280> through<00:01:21.520> those

00:01:21.630 --> 00:01:21.640 
consumer validation going through those

00:01:21.640 --> 00:01:24.420 
consumer validation going through those
bar<00:01:22.470> exam<00:01:23.470> we<00:01:23.619> called<00:01:23.770> them<00:01:23.830> bar<00:01:23.979> exams<00:01:24.250> like
