cylinders once you're done go back and

cylinders once you're done go back and
look<00:02:41.020> at<00:02:41.170> the<00:02:41.230> numbers<00:02:41.530> and<00:02:41.709> it<00:02:42.160> should<00:02:42.370> be

00:02:42.449 --> 00:02:42.459 
look at the numbers and it should be

00:02:42.459 --> 00:02:44.130 
look at the numbers and it should be
readily<00:02:42.940> apparent<00:02:43.120> if<00:02:43.630> you<00:02:43.750> have<00:02:43.870> an<00:02:43.989> issue

readily apparent if you have an issue
for<00:02:44.890> me<00:02:45.100> it's<00:02:45.550> clear<00:02:45.880> that<00:02:45.910> cylinder<00:02:46.450> eight<00:02:46.780> is

00:02:47.160 --> 00:02:47.170 
for me it's clear that cylinder eight is

00:02:47.170 --> 00:02:49.350 
for me it's clear that cylinder eight is
down<00:02:47.440> a<00:02:47.470> bit<00:02:47.770> compared<00:02:48.430> to<00:02:48.489> the<00:02:48.580> others<00:02:48.850> in<00:02:49.030> the

down a bit compared to the others in the

00:02:49.360 --> 00:02:51.449 
down a bit compared to the others in the
compression<00:02:49.690> Department<00:02:50.290> we<00:02:51.010> actually<00:02:51.280> knew

00:02:51.449 --> 00:02:51.459 
compression Department we actually knew

00:02:51.459 --> 00:02:52.920 
compression Department we actually knew
this<00:02:51.700> was<00:02:51.850> most<00:02:52.060> likely<00:02:52.150> the<00:02:52.510> case<00:02:52.690> before

00:02:52.920 --> 00:02:52.930 
this was most likely the case before

00:02:52.930 --> 00:02:54.810 
this was most likely the case before
hooking<00:02:53.470> up<00:02:53.650> the<00:02:53.920> tool<00:02:54.100> because<00:02:54.310> the<00:02:54.580> number

00:02:54.810 --> 00:02:54.820 
hooking up the tool because the number

00:02:54.820 --> 00:02:56.610 
hooking up the tool because the number
eight<00:02:55.000> spark<00:02:55.450> plug<00:02:55.720> was<00:02:55.989> pretty

00:02:56.610 --> 00:02:56.620 
eight spark plug was pretty

00:02:56.620 --> 00:02:59.310 
eight spark plug was pretty
nasty-looking<00:02:57.420> so<00:02:58.420> we<00:02:58.720> know<00:02:58.870> that<00:02:58.900> the<00:02:59.080> truck

00:02:59.310 --> 00:02:59.320 
nasty-looking so we know that the truck

00:02:59.320 --> 00:03:01.020 
nasty-looking so we know that the truck
will<00:02:59.440> need<00:02:59.560> a<00:02:59.590> bottom<00:02:59.950> and<00:03:00.070> rebuild<00:03:00.459> down<00:03:00.850> the

I<00:03:32.620> see<00:03:32.829> the<00:03:32.950> temperature<00:03:33.370> rising<00:03:33.760> now<00:03:34.269> that's

00:03:34.979 --> 00:03:34.989 
I see the temperature rising now that's

00:03:34.989 --> 00:03:36.270 
I see the temperature rising now that's
not<00:03:35.110> out<00:03:35.260> of<00:03:35.290> the<00:03:35.440> norm<00:03:35.470> for<00:03:35.920> an<00:03:35.980> older<00:03:36.160> machine

not out of the norm for an older machine
with<00:03:36.730> what<00:03:37.209> bugs<00:03:37.540> me<00:03:37.750> is<00:03:37.959> that<00:03:38.380> it<00:03:38.620> doesn't

00:03:38.819 --> 00:03:38.829 
with what bugs me is that it doesn't

00:03:38.829 --> 00:03:40.560

there's no shroud on it yes I know
that's<00:03:43.360> part<00:03:43.540> of<00:03:43.570> the<00:03:43.660> problem<00:03:43.900> still<00:03:44.560> I<00:03:44.829> may

00:03:45.360 --> 00:03:45.370 
that's part of the problem still I may

00:03:45.370 --> 00:03:46.920 
that's part of the problem still I may
just<00:03:45.579> go<00:03:45.700> with<00:03:45.850> electric<00:03:46.239> fan<00:03:46.540> so<00:03:46.780> that<00:03:46.840> I

00:03:46.920 --> 00:03:46.930 
just go with electric fan so that I

00:03:46.930 --> 00:03:48.569 
just go with electric fan so that I
don't<00:03:47.019> have<00:03:47.200> to<00:03:47.350> worry<00:03:47.500> about<00:03:47.620> cooling<00:03:48.130> at<00:03:48.370> all

don't have to worry about cooling at all

00:03:48.579 --> 00:03:50.759 
don't have to worry about cooling at all

the<00:04:07.000> vibration<00:04:07.540> disappears<00:04:08.079> completely<00:04:08.790> some

the vibration disappears completely some

00:04:09.790 --> 00:04:11.550 
the vibration disappears completely some
had<00:04:10.060> speculated<00:04:10.420> that<00:04:10.690> if<00:04:10.870> I<00:04:10.989> rotated<00:04:11.470> the

00:04:11.550 --> 00:04:11.560 
had speculated that if I rotated the

00:04:11.560 --> 00:04:14.340 
had speculated that if I rotated the
tires<00:04:11.890> the<00:04:12.400> vibration<00:04:12.910> would<00:04:13.060> disappear<00:04:13.690> we

00:04:14.340 --> 00:04:14.350 
tires the vibration would disappear we

00:04:14.350 --> 00:04:16.080 
tires the vibration would disappear we
did<00:04:14.620> that<00:04:14.799> once<00:04:15.040> we<00:04:15.190> mounted<00:04:15.549> and<00:04:15.700> balanced

00:04:16.080 --> 00:04:16.090 
did that once we mounted and balanced

00:04:16.090 --> 00:04:18.900 
did that once we mounted and balanced
the<00:04:16.209> tires<00:04:16.479> on<00:04:16.750> the<00:04:16.900> new<00:04:17.019> wheels<00:04:17.320> but<00:04:17.890> no<00:04:18.280> it's

00:04:18.900 --> 00:04:18.910 
the tires on the new wheels but no it's

00:04:18.910 --> 00:04:20.550 
the tires on the new wheels but no it's
still<00:04:19.180> there<00:04:19.359> and<00:04:19.570> it's<00:04:19.780> in<00:04:19.900> the<00:04:19.989> exact<00:04:20.350> same

00:04:20.550 --> 00:04:20.560 
still there and it's in the exact same

00:04:20.560 --> 00:04:22.080 
still there and it's in the exact same
spot<00:04:20.739> as<00:04:21.160> it<00:04:21.400> was<00:04:21.519> before

spot as it was before

00:04:22.090 --> 00:04:24.570 
spot as it was before
so<00:04:22.570> we<00:04:23.169> lift<00:04:23.410> up<00:04:23.590> the<00:04:23.650> truck<00:04:23.979> and

00:04:24.570 --> 00:04:24.580 
so we lift up the truck and

00:04:24.580 --> 00:04:25.950 
so we lift up the truck and
someone<00:04:24.909> sit<00:04:25.120> in<00:04:25.180> the<00:04:25.270> cab<00:04:25.479> while<00:04:25.780> we<00:04:25.840> were

someone sit in the cab while we were

00:04:25.960 --> 00:04:27.629 
someone sit in the cab while we were
doing<00:04:26.229> so<00:04:26.560> so<00:04:27.099> that<00:04:27.250> we<00:04:27.310> could<00:04:27.460> watch<00:04:27.610> the

00:04:27.629 --> 00:04:27.639 
doing so so that we could watch the

00:04:27.639 --> 00:04:30.390 
doing so so that we could watch the
driveshaft<00:04:28.090> and<00:04:28.539> the<00:04:29.259> holy<00:04:29.590> hell<00:04:30.069> is<00:04:30.370> that

00:04:30.390 --> 00:04:30.400 
driveshaft and the holy hell is that

00:04:30.400 --> 00:04:32.429

00:04:32.439 --> 00:04:34.350 
thing moving around the rear section
looks<00:04:32.800> to<00:04:32.889> be<00:04:33.009> sticking<00:04:33.280> out<00:04:33.490> a<00:04:33.759> bit<00:04:34.120> further

00:04:34.350 --> 00:04:34.360 
looks to be sticking out a bit further

00:04:34.360 --> 00:04:35.700
