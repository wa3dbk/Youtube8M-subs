 ğŸ¦„ğŸ‘‹ Hello nice people welcome to the channel in today's video I'll talk to you 

00:00:11.240 --> 00:00:15.980
 about my hair I'm going to give you some tips to make your hair grow fast and 

00:00:15.980 --> 00:00:18.860
 healthy so please if you want to know my 

00:00:18.860 --> 00:00:23.300
 tweets thinks watch video and we'll start with the washing of the 

00:00:23.300 --> 00:00:30.109
 hair we see her hair two to three times a week and we see it not with 

00:00:30.109 --> 00:00:36.769
 cold water never with hot water and when applying the shampoo let's do it 

00:00:36.769 --> 00:00:40.339
 with the tips of the fingers never with the nails because it is mistreated enough 

00:00:40.339 --> 00:00:45.409
 our scalp and also when it comes to combing it after what 

00:00:45.409 --> 00:00:50.690
 we have led to won with a comb that bring the teeth apart and not the 

00:00:50.690 --> 00:00:55.670
 teeth 12 because that banking us of the hair and especially when the 

00:00:55.670 --> 00:00:59.629
 hair is wet now we continue with oils yo 

00:00:59.629 --> 00:01:06.110
 before washing my hair I always apply olive oil or coconut oil 

00:01:06.110 --> 00:01:10.159
 the olive oil I applied it in the joints more than anything 

00:01:10.159 --> 00:01:14.420
 and sometimes on the scalp also not every day I step aside 

00:01:14.420 --> 00:01:19.789
 well twice to three times a week so maybe one day I put it on 

00:01:19.789 --> 00:01:23.600
 the scalp and another day not and so on 

00:01:23.600 --> 00:01:30.890
 for when he applied me and coconut oil what I do is moisten the hair not 

00:01:30.890 --> 00:01:35.899
 has left wet but only one mistake and then I explain myself or the oil 

00:01:35.899 --> 00:01:41.810
 of coconut in all the hair all over the scalp and all the hair and 

00:01:41.810 --> 00:01:47.359
 I left it for about 20 minutes and then it is the usual thing 

00:01:47.359 --> 00:01:53.749
 I usually do it and that helps to give a beautiful cold the cheek and 

00:01:53.749 --> 00:01:58.159
 We continue talking about hot objects such as plates and 

00:01:58.159 --> 00:02:05.149
 pincers here or use them moderately not every day because I hot it 

00:02:05.149 --> 00:02:10.700
 the dyes are what we lack more than the hair and therefore if we want the 

00:02:10.700 --> 00:02:15.770
 champion that scale a healthy we have to avoid that normally and a 

00:02:15.770 --> 00:02:19.870
 bad fix twice a week the most is 

00:02:19.870 --> 00:02:25.660
 when you used the hot spots in your hair and let's make sure to use a 

00:02:25.660 --> 00:02:31.870
 protector for the heat of the iron or the terrace because then we will 

00:02:31.870 --> 00:02:37.540
 avoid the split ends and everything else all the effects that the heat of 

00:02:37.540 --> 00:02:42.400
 the iron and the terraces and continue with the haircuts 

00:02:42.400 --> 00:02:46.270
 some people say that you have to cut it every month so that one 

00:02:46.270 --> 00:02:51.220
 hair grows or every three months personally I think that if not 

00:02:51.220 --> 00:02:53.739
 We support once a month or every three months 

00:02:53.739 --> 00:02:59.500
 We are not cutting off what has grown and that is why sometimes we never 

00:02:59.500 --> 00:03:03.760
 will grow if we are not cutting hair accident that I personally 

00:03:03.760 --> 00:03:10.180
 mind that he gave me only twice a year to every six months and what I do 

00:03:10.180 --> 00:03:19.000
 to avoid having the doors open to dry ends is that depending on 

00:03:19.000 --> 00:03:23.580
 how many times have my hair been fixed what I do is once a week or 

00:03:23.580 --> 00:03:30.190
 once every two weeks is to find the ends that are open in the hair 

00:03:30.190 --> 00:03:35.650
 and I cut them with a band-aid and so all those purchases do not accumulate 

00:03:35.650 --> 00:03:40.510
 battered because the tips are what most abuse us when they use the 

00:03:40.510 --> 00:03:45.190
 hot products then I cut them then you need 

00:03:45.190 --> 00:03:48.370
 time you have to spend a little time if 

00:03:48.370 --> 00:03:52.959
 We want to do that but then we have nothing to do, let's put ourselves 

00:03:52.959 --> 00:03:58.959
 has shortened the little battered and that's how I avoid going to the classroom 

00:03:58.959 --> 00:04:03.190
 beauty cut it every month or every three months something that is very important 

00:04:03.190 --> 00:04:10.900
 It is also that when we are going to use a iron a pincer make sure a 

00:04:10.900 --> 00:04:16.239
 close the iron a pincer at the correct temperature for the type of 

00:04:16.239 --> 00:04:20.950
 hair with us we have for example I fit because it is smooth and I do not need 

00:04:20.950 --> 00:04:28.000
 do me a lot then I put it my iron brings instructions from the 

00:04:28.000 --> 00:04:32.410
 temperature for each type of hair and then I put it the shortest or in the 

00:04:32.410 --> 00:04:37.090
 second because sometimes it is a big mistake also that we put it in the highest 

00:04:37.090 --> 00:04:42.340
 and maybe we do not need then we have to avoid this and make sure 

00:04:42.340 --> 00:04:47.470
 always put it in the right temperature for our hair because no 

00:04:47.470 --> 00:04:51.940
 let's forget about our diet, let's try to consume enough 

00:04:51.940 --> 00:04:58.750
 fruits vegetables water vitamins those are very important things for 

00:04:58.750 --> 00:05:02.979
 have healthy hair and others are not very important that we should not 

00:05:02.979 --> 00:05:10.210
 forget is that we should use the right shampoo for our type of 

00:05:10.210 --> 00:05:14.830
