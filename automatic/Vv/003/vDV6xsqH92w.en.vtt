 I welcome you dear farmers 

00:00:03.480 --> 00:00:09.870
 made such a calculator now 

00:00:06.540 --> 00:00:13.139
 write down an explanation to it can be 

00:00:09.870 --> 00:00:20.070
 sound is a bad microphone like that but never 

00:00:13.139 --> 00:00:23.090
 do made to see 

00:00:20.070 --> 00:00:28.800
 How much profit can I get in a month? 

00:00:23.090 --> 00:00:30.779
 don't count there many times well 

00:00:28.800 --> 00:00:33.960
 there are a lot of calculators there 

00:00:30.779 --> 00:00:40.770
 Of course, count everything, but I did under 

00:00:33.960 --> 00:00:49.399
 yourself and faced with what they have and 

00:00:40.770 --> 00:00:52.670
 again pens with kurys say I collected 

00:00:49.399 --> 00:00:56.129
 1200 eggs 

00:00:52.670 --> 00:00:58.969

00:00:56.129 --> 00:01:03.559
 should leave a profit how much 

00:00:58.969 --> 00:01:07.549
 so you have to leave for development 

00:01:03.559 --> 00:01:11.250
 so that's how I did it in the first 

00:01:07.549 --> 00:01:13.080
 the column is written the number of pens 

00:01:11.250 --> 00:01:16.200

00:01:35.130 --> 00:01:42.119
 leave for development 

00:01:37.340 --> 00:01:45.210
