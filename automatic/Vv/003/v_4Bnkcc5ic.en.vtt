00:00:05.340 --> 00:00:11.460
 the ixus 300 hs built into the system so that is called hs system the principle of 

00:00:11.460 --> 00:00:14.640
 this new system is that it integrates two main elements to the image 

00:00:14.640 --> 00:00:16.519
 tf1 the digic processor 4 

00:00:16.519 --> 00:00:19.889
 the new image sensor it's by these words are high sensitivity 

00:00:20.739 --> 00:00:24.759
 the combination of the two so I want to allow 

00:00:24.759 --> 00:00:28.229
 of antoni have flashed system allowing to work extremely speeds 

00:00:28.229 --> 00:00:29.009
 high 

00:00:29.009 --> 00:00:33.180
 ap also enters extremely dark places% while having a 

00:00:33.180 --> 00:00:37.680
 level of ruquier 60% less important than on the preceding range I like 

00:00:37.680 --> 00:00:40.699
 talk about this product there saying that there is a little more than a year to do that for 

00:00:40.699 --> 00:00:44.890
 regain the power of a reflex we also take the quality of 

00:00:44.890 --> 00:00:47.930
 small and stay too smooth and all that combined in one product 

00:00:47.930 --> 00:00:50.790
 extremely critical extremely pleasant to have in hand 

00:00:50.790 --> 00:00:54.160
 so tell us pixels why so today we realized leucan have 

00:00:54.160 --> 00:00:57.130
 launched the g11 the specter lice for example everyone understood that 

00:00:57.130 --> 00:00:59.310
 dillon pixels on a compact 

00:00:59.310 --> 00:01:02.130
 almost exactly are for the needs for in a qualitative image 

00:01:02.130 --> 00:01:03.880
 so that 

00:01:03.880 --> 00:01:07.440
 we wanted him to have an extremely qualitative image quality on this 

00:01:07.440 --> 00:01:08.230
 product there 

00:01:08.230 --> 00:01:11.880
 and blow for nadine puech is is perfectly the resolution for the 

00:01:11.880 --> 00:01:15.880
 chooses for his curvature chose for his safety this new ixus I said that 

00:01:15.880 --> 00:01:18.410
 this camera to create a flat then 105 flex 

00:01:18.410 --> 00:01:22.390
 for m in terms of rate of shooting we have a pace do you agree 

00:01:22.390 --> 00:01:24.400
 this jaw in full resolution 

00:01:24.400 --> 00:01:27.860
 but you can go up to 8 degrees 4 frames per second round without 

00:01:27.860 --> 00:01:30.970
 stop it is not limited to a second second and it gives a little this 

00:01:30.970 --> 00:01:32.440
 what could it cost 

00:01:32.440 --> 00:01:36.760
 o'hare you are relationships to others without stopping so this is 

00:01:36.760 --> 00:01:38.329
 really a boosted product 

00:01:38.329 --> 00:01:39.590
 a product that for five years 

00:01:39.590 --> 00:01:42.310
 arroyo cursed waters is not left out since it is a video mode 

00:01:42.310 --> 00:01:47.999
 to play movies and so in 720p so to render 720p HD video 

00:01:47.999 --> 00:01:49.350
 with stereo sound 

00:01:49.350 --> 00:01:53.240
 and during which we can legally use the optical zoom so things 

00:01:53.240 --> 00:01:54.330
 quite interesting 

00:01:54.330 --> 00:01:57.660
 it's just for fun that there is a way of life 

00:01:57.660 --> 00:01:59.930
 at 240 frames seconds 

00:01:59.930 --> 00:02:03.900
 allowing very precisely to have retarders a finesse and a 

00:02:03.900 --> 00:02:05.450
 exceptional quality 

00:02:05.450 --> 00:02:08.679
 the optical formula and and 7 interesting passes since honda 

00:02:09.589 --> 00:02:15.219
 a friend an optics covering to from bontin to 28 105 opening to 2 

00:02:15.219 --> 00:02:17.889
 and what's even more interesting is that it's a product we're going 

00:02:17.889 --> 00:02:21.939
 being able to disengage and allow, in particular, 

00:02:21.939 --> 00:02:26.010
 failures to 2 we can once again we understand the game of actors that we are 

00:02:26.009 --> 00:02:30.670
 brought closer to one of a reflection product to unleash this extremely compact 

00:02:30.669 --> 00:02:34.159
 because my little one yet have interesting technology plans 

00:02:34.159 --> 00:02:38.239
 from 3 are to purchase on a product for the expert a product that 

00:02:38.239 --> 00:02:42.079
 meets the needs of those who want nick was the image for a no 

00:02:42.079 --> 00:02:45.099
 not brider dance shooting modes 

00:02:45.099 --> 00:02:46.399
 all allowed 

00:02:46.399 --> 00:02:49.520
 so I try rather than the masculine rather masculine tuff 

00:02:49.520 --> 00:02:52.829
 for the colors black or gray or white reminds a little 

00:02:52.829 --> 00:02:53.719
 for that 

00:02:53.719 --> 00:02:55.409
 to bring in less 

00:02:55.409 --> 00:02:58.959
 in euroligue the compactness of quality finish that will appeal to both 

00:02:58.959 --> 00:03:00.180
 women than men I still think 

00:03:00.180 --> 00:03:03.799
 this product will be available here 300 hunters running in May 

00:03:03.799 --> 00:03:09.260
 so for 100 euros we absolutely want from the start what this product is 

00:03:09.260 --> 00:03:10.719
 available everywhere 

00:03:10.719 --> 00:03:13.199
 and so we will tackle it% and very firmly
