I'm<00:02:16.690> going<00:02:16.989> to<00:02:17.050> force<00:02:17.320> you<00:02:17.440> to<00:02:17.500> sound<00:02:17.800> cool<00:02:17.950> and

00:02:18.150 --> 00:02:18.160 
I'm going to force you to sound cool and

00:02:18.160 --> 00:02:20.070 
I'm going to force you to sound cool and
grab<00:02:18.400> the<00:02:18.520> pickup<00:02:18.910> and<00:02:19.330> opposed<00:02:19.690> to<00:02:19.780> pick<00:02:19.959> up

00:02:20.070 --> 00:02:20.080 
grab the pickup and opposed to pick up

00:02:20.080 --> 00:02:22.590 
grab the pickup and opposed to pick up
right<00:02:20.290> into<00:02:20.440> the<00:02:20.530> slide<00:02:20.770> so<00:02:21.760> make<00:02:22.000> someone<00:02:22.510> to

00:02:22.590 --> 00:02:22.600 
right into the slide so make someone to

00:02:22.600 --> 00:02:29.100 
right into the slide so make someone to
pick<00:02:22.780> up<00:02:22.989> a<00:02:23.020> lot<00:02:23.410> easier

00:02:29.100 --> 00:02:29.110 

00:02:29.110 --> 00:02:32.380 

it's<00:02:30.110> natural<00:02:30.580> so<00:02:31.580> it's<00:02:31.700> not<00:02:31.850> like<00:02:32.030> putting<00:02:32.330> a

00:02:32.380 --> 00:02:32.390 
it's natural so it's not like putting a

00:02:32.390 --> 00:02:37.150 
it's natural so it's not like putting a
guitar<00:02:34.150> you
