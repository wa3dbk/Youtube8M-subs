00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.990
 celebrate the fire in the hole yes have something 

00:00:02.040 --> 00:00:05.730
 we have to smile because that means 

00:00:03.990 --> 00:00:07.950
 counterstrike heard for the first time 

00:00:05.730 --> 00:00:10.410
 have and cs is far from that 

00:00:07.950 --> 00:00:12.330
 only game with translation errors 

00:00:10.410 --> 00:00:14.549
 that's why the funniest and 

00:00:12.330 --> 00:00:17.570
 at worst the German as well 

00:00:14.549 --> 00:00:17.570
 English language 

00:00:21.859 --> 00:00:26.099
 homefront appeared in 2011 and was released by 

00:00:24.930 --> 00:00:28.259
 the games press with the 

00:00:26.099 --> 00:00:30.270
 average rating of 70 as 

00:00:28.259 --> 00:00:32.099
 satisfactory rated less 

00:00:30.270 --> 00:00:34.470
 Satisfactory, however, was the German 

00:00:32.099 --> 00:00:36.449
 Synchronization di-sprecher appear 

00:00:34.470 --> 00:00:38.519
 partly unmotivated and also that 

00:00:36.449 --> 00:00:39.870
 Timing is not always correct 

00:00:38.519 --> 00:00:42.019
 pats homefront into the counter strike 

00:00:39.870 --> 00:00:44.730
 fall and translate short battle cries 

00:00:42.019 --> 00:00:46.800
 literally what are cs source the fire 

00:00:44.730 --> 00:00:49.829
 in the hole so the hole was in the fire 

00:00:46.800 --> 00:00:51.120
 is in front of the home call drop on 

00:00:49.829 --> 00:00:53.670
 German we would say something like that 

00:00:51.120 --> 00:00:56.580
 make them all or make them flat 

00:00:53.670 --> 00:00:57.890
 publisher thq made it one now 

00:00:56.580 --> 00:01:00.930
 throw off 

00:00:57.890 --> 00:01:03.799
 literally correct content, however 

00:01:00.930 --> 00:01:03.799
 totally wrong 

00:01:12.810 --> 00:01:18.240
 final fantasy 7 is considered by fans 

00:01:15.420 --> 00:01:19.890
 one of the best parts of the series 

00:01:18.240 --> 00:01:21.899
 good game does not mean that 

00:01:19.890 --> 00:01:23.939
 no errors are included 

00:01:21.899 --> 00:01:24.990
 localization of final fantasy 7 is 

00:01:23.939 --> 00:01:27.720
 Many are still remembered today 

00:01:24.990 --> 00:01:30.899
 stayed with sentences as they wait 

00:01:27.720 --> 00:01:32.909
 already all the inn of lower or reed 

00:01:30.899 --> 00:01:35.610
 Carefully sign and sign him 

00:01:32.909 --> 00:01:38.220
 then yes from juwi even the new edition 

00:01:35.610 --> 00:01:40.500
 for the pc of 2012 got no new one 

00:01:38.220 --> 00:01:42.720
 Translation is an apparent and after 

00:01:40.500 --> 00:01:43.350
 is not that the PC port for ps4 

00:01:42.720 --> 00:01:45.030
 to change 

00:01:43.350 --> 00:01:46.649
 but there are some fans 

00:01:45.030 --> 00:01:48.659
 actually a German translation 

00:01:46.649 --> 00:01:48.990
 which are downloaded for free 

00:01:48.659 --> 00:01:50.939
 can 

00:01:48.990 --> 00:02:02.729
 but the installation instructions please 

00:01:50.939 --> 00:02:05.189
 due to final fantasy 10 

00:02:02.729 --> 00:02:07.530
 has 7 drawers full like final fantasy 

00:02:05.189 --> 00:02:09.479
 translation errors here and there 

00:02:07.530 --> 00:02:10.259
 just become other content 

00:02:09.479 --> 00:02:12.750
 reproduced 

00:02:10.259 --> 00:02:15.030
 For example, the sentence I'm long after 

00:02:12.750 --> 00:02:17.130
 He was waiting for ten years 

00:02:15.030 --> 00:02:19.680
 let there be enough time with it 

00:02:17.130 --> 00:02:21.480
 was translated passed can to 

00:02:19.680 --> 00:02:23.370
 but still be valid since it yes 

00:02:21.480 --> 00:02:25.950
 except the exact time almost the 

00:02:23.370 --> 00:02:27.690
 the same means we ask ourselves something 

00:02:25.950 --> 00:02:30.810
 the translators are actually at the 

00:02:27.690 --> 00:02:33.060
 unique sentence of a ju so i love 

00:02:30.810 --> 00:02:35.310
 you had thought because Jonah had 

00:02:33.060 --> 00:02:39.230
 in our opinion more on the heart 

00:02:35.310 --> 00:02:39.230
 as a simple thank you 

00:02:53.850 --> 00:02:57.870
 an open world of games numerous 

00:02:56.070 --> 00:03:00.630
 side quests and an exciting one 

00:02:57.870 --> 00:03:03.150
 history that has everything short 4 oblivion 

00:03:00.630 --> 00:03:05.190
 a lot done right and exactly one 

00:03:03.150 --> 00:03:06.420
 wrong the german translation 

00:03:05.190 --> 00:03:08.580
 so was a healing magic 

00:03:06.420 --> 00:03:10.140
 incorrectly using the word fire in 

00:03:08.580 --> 00:03:12.780
 described and in some sections 

00:03:10.140 --> 00:03:14.910
 the translation was missing wherein 

00:03:12.780 --> 00:03:16.590
 There are also characters like this place 

00:03:14.910 --> 00:03:18.990
 known for this is similar sounding 

00:03:16.590 --> 00:03:21.330
 to convert words we convert 

00:03:18.990 --> 00:03:24.090
 about princess rockwood that she was at 

00:03:21.330 --> 00:03:27.360
 It was easy to search for stones 

00:03:24.090 --> 00:03:28.770
 My guess is that the orga 

00:03:27.360 --> 00:03:30.840
 they have taken 

00:03:28.770 --> 00:03:38.760
 I am very touched and really 

00:03:30.840 --> 00:03:40.410
 conceivable some translation errors are 

00:03:38.760 --> 00:03:42.420
 even so famous that they have their own 

00:03:40.410 --> 00:03:44.070
 teams land on the net and others 

00:03:42.420 --> 00:03:46.080
 games developers as easter eggs 

00:03:44.070 --> 00:03:49.890
 continue to be used as the famous 

00:03:46.080 --> 00:03:51.090
 set from simmering from 1989 audio base 

00:03:49.890 --> 00:03:53.340
 are belong to us 

00:03:51.090 --> 00:03:55.560
 All your bases were meant 

00:03:53.340 --> 00:03:57.450
 Accordingly we would be in the 

00:03:55.560 --> 00:03:59.550
 English European belong to us 

00:03:57.450 --> 00:04:02.040
 say the developers of empire earth 

00:03:59.550 --> 00:04:03.720
 and warcraft 3 built the pack as 

00:04:02.040 --> 00:04:06.120
 Divorced in their games 1 

00:04:03.720 --> 00:04:10.190
 on striker lets the saying in the what 

00:04:06.120 --> 00:04:10.190
 would be if machine follows 

00:04:11.040 --> 00:04:14.370
 yes the fire in the hole was in 

00:04:12.629 --> 00:04:16.799
 course counter-strike long ago 

00:04:14.370 --> 00:04:18.539
 but patched the final fantasy TV 

00:04:16.799 --> 00:04:20.699
 stay with us 

00:04:18.539 --> 00:04:22.740
 in this sense, watched our street 

00:04:20.699 --> 00:04:26.360
 fighter iv and presses on the stays there 

00:04:22.740 --> 00:04:26.360
 box of high 5
