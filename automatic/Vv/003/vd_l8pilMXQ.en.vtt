all<00:00:29.160> tents<00:00:29.490> from<00:00:30.210> the<00:00:30.330> very<00:00:30.599> beginning<00:00:30.779> I

00:00:31.099 --> 00:00:31.109 
all tents from the very beginning I

00:00:31.109 --> 00:00:32.720

00:00:32.720 --> 00:00:32.730 
think we started the war pretty late and

00:00:32.730 --> 00:00:34.430 
think we started the war pretty late and
we<00:00:32.910> didn't<00:00:33.120> do<00:00:33.210> many<00:00:33.420> attacks<00:00:33.780> in<00:00:34.079> the<00:00:34.230> very

00:00:34.430 --> 00:00:34.440 
we didn't do many attacks in the very

00:00:34.440 --> 00:00:36.080 
we didn't do many attacks in the very
beginning<00:00:34.620> of<00:00:34.890> the<00:00:35.010> war<00:00:35.040> they<00:00:35.640> did<00:00:35.820> a<00:00:35.850> lot<00:00:36.059> of

00:00:36.080 --> 00:00:36.090 
beginning of the war they did a lot of

00:00:36.090 --> 00:00:37.729 
beginning of the war they did a lot of
attacks<00:00:36.420> against<00:00:36.750> our<00:00:36.809> Town<00:00:37.050> Hall<00:00:37.230> tents<00:00:37.500> and

00:00:37.729 --> 00:00:37.739

00:00:39.770 --> 00:00:39.780 
they actually did a pretty good job so

00:00:39.780 --> 00:00:41.690 
they actually did a pretty good job so
usually<00:00:40.170> when<00:00:40.290> we<00:00:40.379> attack<00:00:40.649> clans<00:00:40.950> people

00:00:41.690 --> 00:00:41.700 
usually when we attack clans people

00:00:41.700 --> 00:00:43.940 
usually when we attack clans people

00:01:19.399 --> 00:01:19.409 
or even the first start he had to have

00:01:19.409 --> 00:01:20.539 
or even the first start he had to have
his<00:01:19.530> Queen<00:01:19.770> shooted<00:01:20.070> down<00:01:20.189> at<00:01:20.340> the<00:01:20.400> last

his Queen shooted down at the last

00:01:20.549 --> 00:01:22.460 
his Queen shooted down at the last
second<00:01:20.880> but<00:01:20.939> anyways<00:01:21.270> got<00:01:21.840> the<00:01:21.990> second<00:01:22.290> star

00:01:22.460 --> 00:01:22.470 
second but anyways got the second star

00:01:22.470 --> 00:01:23.780 
second but anyways got the second star
and<00:01:22.590> that's<00:01:22.650> all<00:01:22.860> that<00:01:23.009> mattered<00:01:23.430> and<00:01:23.580> let<00:01:23.729> me

00:01:23.780 --> 00:01:23.790 
and that's all that mattered and let me

00:01:27.649 --> 00:01:27.659 
score was with 8 hours left so we've

00:01:27.659 --> 00:01:29.060 
score was with 8 hours left so we've
been<00:01:27.780> in<00:01:27.930> some<00:01:28.080> tough<00:01:28.200> Wars<00:01:28.470> before<00:01:28.650> where

00:01:29.060 --> 00:01:29.070 
been in some tough Wars before where

00:01:29.070 --> 00:01:30.890 
been in some tough Wars before where
we've<00:01:29.189> been<00:01:29.310> down<00:01:29.460> big<00:01:29.790> and<00:01:30.030> this<00:01:30.479> one<00:01:30.659> was

00:01:30.890 --> 00:01:30.900 
we've been down big and this one was

00:01:30.900 --> 00:01:33.319 
we've been down big and this one was
definitely<00:01:31.320> no<00:01:31.860> different<00:01:32.280> we<00:01:32.369> were<00:01:32.490> down<00:01:32.640> 31

00:01:33.319 --> 00:01:33.329 
definitely no different we were down 31

00:01:33.329 --> 00:01:35.270 
definitely no different we were down 31
stars<00:01:33.720> with<00:01:33.960> 8<00:01:34.140> and<00:01:34.170> a<00:01:34.409> half<00:01:34.439> hours<00:01:35.009> we<00:01:35.159> were

00:01:35.270 --> 00:01:35.280 
stars with 8 and a half hours we were

00:01:35.280 --> 00:01:37.520 
stars with 8 and a half hours we were
actually<00:01:35.670> down<00:01:35.820> 40<00:01:36.360> stars<00:01:36.659> at<00:01:36.900> one<00:01:37.049> point<00:01:37.259> and

00:01:37.520 --> 00:01:37.530 
actually down 40 stars at one point and

00:01:37.530 --> 00:01:39.140 
actually down 40 stars at one point and
the<00:01:38.009> things<00:01:38.280> were<00:01:38.490> definitely<00:01:38.909> looking

00:01:39.140 --> 00:01:39.150 
the things were definitely looking

00:01:39.150 --> 00:01:41.960 
the things were definitely looking
really<00:01:39.869> really<00:01:40.079> grim<00:01:40.500> so<00:01:41.009> we<00:01:41.310> sort<00:01:41.579> of<00:01:41.670> had<00:01:41.850> to

00:01:41.960 --> 00:01:41.970 
really really grim so we sort of had to

00:01:41.970 --> 00:01:43.670 
really really grim so we sort of had to
strap<00:01:42.180> on<00:01:42.329> her<00:01:42.450> boots<00:01:42.630> go<00:01:42.869> to<00:01:42.930> battle<00:01:43.320> and<00:01:43.439> see

00:01:43.670 --> 00:01:43.680 
strap on her boots go to battle and see

00:01:43.680 --> 00:01:45.830 
strap on her boots go to battle and see
if<00:01:43.829> we<00:01:43.950> could<00:01:44.130> win<00:01:44.280> some<00:01:44.610> some<00:01:45.030> stars<00:01:45.299> back<00:01:45.540> so

00:01:45.830 --> 00:01:45.840 
if we could win some some stars back so

00:01:45.840 --> 00:01:46.940 
if we could win some some stars back so
I<00:01:45.990> want<00:01:46.380> to<00:01:46.439> go<00:01:46.500> ahead<00:01:46.649> and<00:01:46.740> show<00:01:46.799> you<00:01:46.860> guys

I want to go ahead and show you guys
exactly<00:01:47.340> how<00:01:47.820> the<00:01:48.000> matchup<00:01:48.509> looked<00:01:48.780> because

00:01:48.950 --> 00:01:48.960 
exactly how the matchup looked because

00:01:48.960 --> 00:01:50.510 
exactly how the matchup looked because
this<00:01:49.200> was<00:01:49.350> pretty<00:01:49.590> important<00:01:50.220> there<00:01:50.399> were<00:01:50.490> a

00:01:50.510 --> 00:01:50.520 
this was pretty important there were a

00:01:50.520 --> 00:01:52.850 
this was pretty important there were a
lot<00:01:50.790> of<00:01:50.820> differences<00:01:51.420> in<00:01:51.600> our<00:01:51.899> bases<00:01:52.350> and<00:01:52.530> a

00:01:52.850 --> 00:01:52.860 
lot of differences in our bases and a

00:01:52.860 --> 00:01:54.020 
lot of differences in our bases and a
lot<00:01:52.979> of<00:01:53.100> our<00:01:53.189> members<00:01:53.340> were<00:01:53.579> complaining

00:01:54.020 --> 00:01:54.030 
lot of our members were complaining

00:01:54.030 --> 00:01:56.060 
lot of our members were complaining
because<00:01:54.119> of<00:01:54.509> the<00:01:54.600> fact<00:01:54.840> that<00:01:55.079> they<00:01:55.409> were<00:01:55.470> a<00:01:55.560> lot

00:01:56.060 --> 00:01:56.070 
because of the fact that they were a lot

00:01:56.070 --> 00:01:57.410 
because of the fact that they were a lot
stronger<00:01:56.340> than<00:01:56.490> us<00:01:56.729> for<00:01:56.880> example<00:01:57.240> there's

00:01:57.410 --> 00:01:57.420 
stronger than us for example there's

00:01:57.420 --> 00:01:59.330 
stronger than us for example there's
their<00:01:57.600> number<00:01:57.840> 6<00:01:58.049> base<00:01:58.229> they<00:01:58.680> had<00:01:58.829> level<00:01:59.100> 40

00:01:59.330 --> 00:01:59.340 
their number 6 base they had level 40

00:01:59.340 --> 00:02:02.090 
their number 6 base they had level 40
heroes<00:01:59.700> and<00:01:59.909> for<00:02:00.600> our<00:02:00.780> base<00:02:01.020> 4<00:02:01.409> at<00:02:01.469> level<00:02:01.740> 6<00:02:01.979> we

00:02:02.090 --> 00:02:02.100 
heroes and for our base 4 at level 6 we

00:02:02.100 --> 00:02:04.370 
heroes and for our base 4 at level 6 we
only<00:02:02.250> have<00:02:02.369> level<00:02:02.640> 21<00:02:02.939> and<00:02:03.270> 28<00:02:03.719> I<00:02:03.990> think<00:02:04.259> I'm

00:02:04.370 --> 00:02:04.380 
only have level 21 and 28 I think I'm

00:02:04.380 --> 00:02:05.990 
only have level 21 and 28 I think I'm
actually<00:02:04.590> the<00:02:04.950> only<00:02:05.100> person<00:02:05.369> in<00:02:05.670> our<00:02:05.759> clan

00:02:05.990 --> 00:02:06.000 
actually the only person in our clan

00:02:06.000 --> 00:02:07.370 
actually the only person in our clan
with<00:02:06.149> level<00:02:06.390> 40<00:02:06.630> heroes<00:02:06.899> I<00:02:07.020> haven't<00:02:07.259> checked

00:02:07.370 --> 00:02:07.380 
with level 40 heroes I haven't checked

00:02:07.380 --> 00:02:09.469 
with level 40 heroes I haven't checked
in<00:02:07.560> a<00:02:07.619> while<00:02:07.829> but<00:02:08.789> yeah<00:02:09.030> they<00:02:09.179> were<00:02:09.239> a<00:02:09.300> little

00:02:09.469 --> 00:02:09.479 
in a while but yeah they were a little

00:02:09.479 --> 00:02:11.150 
in a while but yeah they were a little
bit<00:02:09.690> stronger<00:02:09.989> at<00:02:10.080> the<00:02:10.140> top<00:02:10.349> and<00:02:10.560> then<00:02:10.649> going

00:02:11.150 --> 00:02:11.160 
bit stronger at the top and then going

00:02:11.160 --> 00:02:12.410 
bit stronger at the top and then going
like<00:02:11.370> the<00:02:11.490> center<00:02:11.790> of<00:02:11.880> the<00:02:11.970> base<00:02:12.120> this<00:02:12.360> is

00:02:12.410 --> 00:02:12.420 
like the center of the base this is

00:02:12.420 --> 00:02:15.230 
like the center of the base this is
their<00:02:12.720> number<00:02:13.020> 37<00:02:13.770> so<00:02:14.220> completely<00:02:14.700> maxed<00:02:15.000> out

00:02:15.230 --> 00:02:15.240 
their number 37 so completely maxed out

00:02:15.240 --> 00:02:16.850 
their number 37 so completely maxed out
of<00:02:15.330> town<00:02:15.480> hall<00:02:15.660> 9<00:02:15.840> and<00:02:16.110> that<00:02:16.200> made<00:02:16.380> it<00:02:16.410> a<00:02:16.560> really

00:02:16.850 --> 00:02:16.860 
of town hall 9 and that made it a really

00:02:16.860 --> 00:02:18.350 
of town hall 9 and that made it a really
big<00:02:17.010> struggle<00:02:17.190> for<00:02:17.430> us<00:02:17.640> because<00:02:17.850> we<00:02:18.120> couldn't

00:02:18.350 --> 00:02:18.360 
big struggle for us because we couldn't

00:02:18.360 --> 00:02:20.090 
big struggle for us because we couldn't
three-star<00:02:19.140> a<00:02:19.170> lot<00:02:19.440> of<00:02:19.530> their<00:02:19.710> town<00:02:19.920> all<00:02:20.070> night

00:02:20.090 --> 00:02:20.100 
three-star a lot of their town all night

00:02:20.100 --> 00:02:22.640 
three-star a lot of their town all night
for<00:02:20.490> example<00:02:20.550> this<00:02:20.940> is<00:02:21.150> our<00:02:21.330> number<00:02:21.600> 37<00:02:22.200> and<00:02:22.350> as

00:02:22.640 --> 00:02:22.650 
for example this is our number 37 and as

00:02:22.650 --> 00:02:25.550 
for example this is our number 37 and as
you<00:02:22.770> can<00:02:22.920> see<00:02:23.070> it's<00:02:23.190> only<00:02:23.490> maybe<00:02:23.670> a<00:02:23.820> mid<00:02:24.150> to<00:02:24.600> 60%

00:02:25.550 --> 00:02:25.560 
you can see it's only maybe a mid to 60%

00:02:25.560 --> 00:02:28.070 
you can see it's only maybe a mid to 60%
through<00:02:26.130> town<00:02:26.340> all<00:02:26.520> nine<00:02:26.960> couple<00:02:27.960> more

00:02:28.070 --> 00:02:28.080 
through town all nine couple more

00:02:28.080 --> 00:02:29.960 
through town all nine couple more
examples<00:02:28.170> arcs<00:02:28.890> one<00:02:29.040> earth<00:02:29.220> there<00:02:29.460> twenty<00:02:29.760> six

00:02:29.960 --> 00:02:29.970 
examples arcs one earth there twenty six

00:02:29.970 --> 00:02:31.520 
examples arcs one earth there twenty six
is<00:02:30.120> a<00:02:30.150> town<00:02:30.390> all<00:02:30.570> ten<00:02:30.750> to<00:02:30.960> inferno<00:02:31.260> towers

00:02:31.520 --> 00:02:31.530 
is a town all ten to inferno towers

00:02:31.530 --> 00:02:33.770 
is a town all ten to inferno towers
looks<00:02:31.920> pretty<00:02:32.130> good<00:02:32.310> our<00:02:32.580> number<00:02:33.330> twenty<00:02:33.600> six

00:02:33.770 --> 00:02:33.780 
looks pretty good our number twenty six

00:02:33.780 --> 00:02:35.840 
looks pretty good our number twenty six
still<00:02:34.200> stuck<00:02:34.470> at<00:02:34.500> townhall<00:02:34.830> 9<00:02:35.010> so<00:02:35.430> our<00:02:35.580> twenty

00:02:35.840 --> 00:02:35.850 
still stuck at townhall 9 so our twenty

00:02:35.850 --> 00:02:38.300 
still stuck at townhall 9 so our twenty
six<00:02:36.090> usually<00:02:36.750> looks<00:02:37.290> more<00:02:37.560> like<00:02:37.770> their<00:02:37.980> their

00:02:38.300 --> 00:02:38.310 
six usually looks more like their their

00:02:38.310 --> 00:02:40.070 
six usually looks more like their their
number<00:02:38.580> thirty<00:02:38.850> seven<00:02:38.940> and<00:02:39.300> then<00:02:39.780> for<00:02:39.960> our

00:02:40.070 --> 00:02:40.080 
number thirty seven and then for our

00:02:40.080 --> 00:02:42.110 
number thirty seven and then for our
final<00:02:40.500> example<00:02:40.620> we<00:02:41.310> actually<00:02:41.670> do<00:02:41.790> have<00:02:41.910> town

00:02:42.110 --> 00:02:42.120

all<00:02:42.270> eights<00:02:42.480> in<00:02:42.630> our<00:02:42.720> clan<00:02:42.900> at<00:02:43.050> number<00:02:43.260> 45<00:02:43.680> 44

00:02:44.450 --> 00:02:44.460 
all eights in our clan at number 45 44

00:02:44.460 --> 00:02:46.580 
all eights in our clan at number 45 44
and<00:02:44.730> 43<00:02:45.390> I<00:02:45.420> think<00:02:45.780> those<00:02:45.990> are<00:02:46.140> actually<00:02:46.470> my

00:02:46.580 --> 00:02:46.590 
and 43 I think those are actually my

00:02:46.590 --> 00:02:48.440 
and 43 I think those are actually my
real<00:02:46.770> life<00:02:46.950> friends<00:02:47.310> and<00:02:47.490> for<00:02:48.210> their<00:02:48.360> number

00:02:48.440 --> 00:02:48.450 
real life friends and for their number

00:02:48.450 --> 00:02:50.360 
real life friends and for their number
45<00:02:48.960> it<00:02:49.290> is<00:02:49.440> actually<00:02:49.800> a<00:02:49.830> pretty<00:02:50.100> good-looking

00:02:50.360 --> 00:02:50.370 
45 it is actually a pretty good-looking

00:02:50.370 --> 00:02:52.340 
45 it is actually a pretty good-looking
town<00:02:50.850> all<00:02:51.030> nine<00:02:51.300> so<00:02:51.720> that's<00:02:51.840> really<00:02:52.080> what<00:02:52.260> the

00:02:52.340 --> 00:02:52.350 
town all nine so that's really what the

00:02:52.350 --> 00:02:53.660 
town all nine so that's really what the
bases<00:02:52.680> looked<00:02:52.860> like<00:02:52.980> and<00:02:53.160> we<00:02:53.220> knew<00:02:53.340> what<00:02:53.550> the

00:02:53.660 --> 00:02:53.670 
bases looked like and we knew what the

00:02:53.670 --> 00:02:55.580 
bases looked like and we knew what the
odds<00:02:53.850> were<00:02:54.180> stacked<00:02:54.210> against<00:02:55.080> us<00:02:55.200> but<00:02:55.470> there

00:02:55.580 --> 00:02:55.590 
odds were stacked against us but there

00:02:55.590 --> 00:02:56.840 
odds were stacked against us but there
is<00:02:55.680> no<00:02:55.830> reason<00:02:56.040> that<00:02:56.220> we<00:02:56.340> couldn't<00:02:56.460> come<00:02:56.700> back

00:02:56.840 --> 00:02:56.850 
is no reason that we couldn't come back

00:02:56.850 --> 00:02:58.670 
is no reason that we couldn't come back
and<00:02:56.910> win<00:02:57.150> the<00:02:57.270> war<00:02:57.450> so<00:02:58.140> we<00:02:58.290> wouldn't<00:02:58.470> hadn't

00:02:58.670 --> 00:02:58.680 
and win the war so we wouldn't hadn't

00:02:58.680 --> 00:03:00.200 
and win the war so we wouldn't hadn't
good<00:02:58.830> to<00:02:58.950> work<00:02:59.130> and<00:02:59.340> I<00:02:59.400> started<00:02:59.730> to<00:02:59.850> do<00:02:59.970> some<00:03:00.000> of

as those guys go down and then a pretty

00:04:44.230 --> 00:04:45.720 
as those guys go down and then a pretty
creative<00:04:44.500> attack<00:04:44.920> attacking<00:04:45.430> through<00:04:45.610> the

creative attack attacking through the

00:04:45.730 --> 00:04:47.250 
creative attack attacking through the
top<00:04:45.910> right<00:04:46.210> a<00:04:46.240> lot<00:04:46.510> of<00:04:46.630> people<00:04:46.840> might<00:04:47.020> choose

00:04:47.250 --> 00:04:47.260 
top right a lot of people might choose

00:04:47.260 --> 00:04:48.570 
top right a lot of people might choose
to<00:04:47.410> attack<00:04:47.680> through<00:04:47.830> the<00:04:47.950> very<00:04:48.130> bottom<00:04:48.460> of<00:04:48.520> the

00:04:48.570 --> 00:04:48.580 
to attack through the very bottom of the

00:04:48.580 --> 00:04:50.370 
to attack through the very bottom of the
base<00:04:48.730> but<00:04:48.970> that's<00:04:49.450> actually<00:04:49.780> where<00:04:49.930> most<00:04:50.170> of

00:04:50.370 --> 00:04:50.380 
base but that's actually where most of

00:04:50.380 --> 00:04:53.880 
base but that's actually where most of
the<00:04:50.590> defenses<00:04:51.340> of<00:04:51.580> this<00:04:52.510> base<00:04:52.720> were<00:04:53.050> so<00:04:53.710> went

00:04:53.880 --> 00:04:53.890 
the defenses of this base were so went

00:04:53.890 --> 00:04:55.230 
the defenses of this base were so went
ahead<00:04:53.950> and<00:04:54.100> attack<00:04:54.310> from<00:04:54.460> the<00:04:54.580> top<00:04:54.730> right<00:04:55.000> and

00:04:55.230 --> 00:04:55.240 
ahead and attack from the top right and

00:04:55.240 --> 00:04:56.580 
ahead and attack from the top right and
it<00:04:55.510> looks<00:04:55.750> like<00:04:55.840> it's<00:04:56.050> doing<00:04:56.170> a<00:04:56.320> pretty<00:04:56.500> good

00:04:56.580 --> 00:04:56.590 
it looks like it's doing a pretty good

00:04:56.590 --> 00:04:57.630 
it looks like it's doing a pretty good
job<00:04:56.710> in<00:04:56.860> the<00:04:56.980> very<00:04:57.130> beginning

00:04:57.630 --> 00:04:57.640 
job in the very beginning

00:04:57.640 --> 00:04:59.430 
job in the very beginning
all<00:04:58.030> right<00:04:58.150> Packers<00:04:58.480> are<00:04:58.600> down<00:04:58.750> heroes<00:04:59.230> are

00:04:59.430 --> 00:04:59.440 
all right Packers are down heroes are

00:04:59.440 --> 00:05:01.410 
all right Packers are down heroes are
down<00:04:59.830> looks<00:05:00.400> like<00:05:00.550> there's<00:05:00.730> a<00:05:00.790> straight<00:05:01.150> shot

00:05:01.410 --> 00:05:01.420 
down looks like there's a straight shot

00:05:01.420 --> 00:05:02.880 
down looks like there's a straight shot
to<00:05:01.630> the<00:05:01.750> center<00:05:02.110> most<00:05:02.320> of<00:05:02.440> the<00:05:02.500> troops<00:05:02.740> are

00:05:02.880 --> 00:05:02.890 
to the center most of the troops are

00:05:02.890 --> 00:05:04.590 
to the center most of the troops are
staying<00:05:03.100> together<00:05:03.280> only<00:05:03.790> one<00:05:04.000> wizard<00:05:04.180> went<00:05:04.510> up

00:05:04.590 --> 00:05:04.600 
staying together only one wizard went up

00:05:04.600 --> 00:05:05.940 
staying together only one wizard went up
to<00:05:04.720> the<00:05:04.810> very<00:05:04.930> top<00:05:05.020> which<00:05:05.380> is<00:05:05.410> pretty<00:05:05.680> funny

00:05:05.940 --> 00:05:05.950 
to the very top which is pretty funny

00:05:05.950 --> 00:05:07.950 
to the very top which is pretty funny
and<00:05:06.160> now<00:05:06.730> the<00:05:06.790> free<00:05:07.090> spell<00:05:07.300> has<00:05:07.480> been<00:05:07.510> dropped

00:05:07.950 --> 00:05:07.960 
and now the free spell has been dropped

00:05:07.960 --> 00:05:09.300 
and now the free spell has been dropped
and<00:05:08.170> the<00:05:08.470> troops<00:05:08.680> are<00:05:08.830> making<00:05:08.920> their<00:05:09.160> way<00:05:09.190> to

00:05:09.300 --> 00:05:09.310 
and the troops are making their way to

00:05:09.310 --> 00:05:10.500 
and the troops are making their way to
the<00:05:09.460> center<00:05:09.670> of<00:05:09.730> the<00:05:09.820> base<00:05:09.940> so<00:05:10.210> this<00:05:10.390> is<00:05:10.480> a

the center of the base so this is a

00:05:10.510 --> 00:05:12.210 
the center of the base so this is a
pretty<00:05:10.810> good-looking<00:05:11.110> raid<00:05:11.500> so<00:05:11.710> far<00:05:11.920> I<00:05:11.950> know<00:05:12.130> I

00:05:19.470 --> 00:05:19.480 
it's looking good for at least a

00:05:19.480 --> 00:05:22.530 
it's looking good for at least a
two-star<00:05:20.070> so<00:05:21.070> 38%<00:05:21.760> second<00:05:22.090> free<00:05:22.210> spell<00:05:22.420> was

00:05:25.800 --> 00:05:25.810 
did destroy a pretty good amount of

00:05:25.810 --> 00:05:27.330 
did destroy a pretty good amount of
troops<00:05:26.050> but<00:05:26.230> still<00:05:26.500> the<00:05:26.620> pekka's<00:05:26.950> are<00:05:27.070> up<00:05:27.190> the

00:05:27.330 --> 00:05:27.340 
troops but still the pekka's are up the

00:05:27.340 --> 00:05:29.490 
troops but still the pekka's are up the
heroes<00:05:27.669> are<00:05:27.820> up<00:05:28.000> and<00:05:28.150> things<00:05:28.900> actually<00:05:29.140> look

00:05:29.490 --> 00:05:29.500 
heroes are up and things actually look

00:05:29.500 --> 00:05:31.350 
heroes are up and things actually look
like<00:05:29.530> they<00:05:30.010> could<00:05:30.070> turn<00:05:30.460> in<00:05:30.640> our<00:05:30.730> favor<00:05:31.000> and<00:05:31.240> we

00:05:31.350 --> 00:05:31.360 
like they could turn in our favor and we

00:05:31.360 --> 00:05:33.150 
like they could turn in our favor and we
could<00:05:31.600> get<00:05:31.720> a<00:05:31.780> three-star<00:05:32.380> on<00:05:32.530> this<00:05:32.680> raid<00:05:32.919> so

00:05:33.150 --> 00:05:33.160 
could get a three-star on this raid so

00:05:33.160 --> 00:05:34.560 
could get a three-star on this raid so
let's<00:05:33.340> just<00:05:33.490> go<00:05:33.640> ahead<00:05:33.760> and<00:05:34.000> see<00:05:34.150> what<00:05:34.270> happens

let's just go ahead and see what happens
and<00:05:34.780> just<00:05:35.440> do<00:05:35.620> a<00:05:35.650> little<00:05:36.010> bit<00:05:36.160> of<00:05:36.250> a

00:05:36.300 --> 00:05:36.310 
and just do a little bit of a

00:05:36.310 --> 00:05:37.860 
and just do a little bit of a
fast-forward<00:05:36.820> so<00:05:37.030> I<00:05:37.060> can<00:05:37.240> show<00:05:37.419> you<00:05:37.480> guys<00:05:37.690> what

00:05:37.860 --> 00:05:37.870 
fast-forward so I can show you guys what

00:05:37.870 --> 00:05:41.730 
fast-forward so I can show you guys what
happens<00:05:38.169> towards<00:05:38.470> the<00:05:38.590> end<00:05:38.740> so<00:05:39.180> 55%<00:05:40.180> 57<00:05:40.780> 58<00:05:41.080> %

the wire and we only get two stars on a
ninety<00:06:05.710> nine<00:06:05.860> percent<00:06:06.310> for<00:06:06.400> the<00:06:06.640> raid<00:06:06.820> so<00:06:07.060> this

00:06:07.590 --> 00:06:07.600 
ninety nine percent for the raid so this

00:06:07.600 --> 00:06:09.090 
ninety nine percent for the raid so this
happened<00:06:07.930> a<00:06:07.960> lot<00:06:08.080> to<00:06:08.290> us<00:06:08.440> we<00:06:08.560> weren't<00:06:08.740> able<00:06:08.950> to

00:06:09.090 --> 00:06:09.100 
happened a lot to us we weren't able to

00:06:09.100 --> 00:06:10.140

unfortunately<00:06:11.080> there<00:06:11.169> were<00:06:11.260> some<00:06:11.320> bases<00:06:11.680> we

00:06:11.790 --> 00:06:11.800 
unfortunately there were some bases we

00:06:11.800 --> 00:06:13.350 
unfortunately there were some bases we
weren't<00:06:12.010> even<00:06:12.070> able<00:06:12.280> to<00:06:12.430> get<00:06:12.580> two<00:06:12.730> stars<00:06:13.000> on<00:06:13.180> so

guys I look through the like the log and
where<00:06:36.780> exactly<00:06:36.930> we<00:06:37.410> failed<00:06:37.650> in<00:06:37.830> this<00:06:37.920> raid<00:06:38.190> so

00:06:39.140 --> 00:06:39.150 
where exactly we failed in this raid so

00:06:39.150 --> 00:06:40.310 
where exactly we failed in this raid so
attacking<00:06:39.420> them<00:06:39.660> there's<00:06:39.870> a<00:06:39.930> base<00:06:40.110> right

00:06:40.310 --> 00:06:40.320 
attacking them there's a base right

00:06:40.320 --> 00:06:41.750 
attacking them there's a base right
there<00:06:40.380> that<00:06:40.680> has<00:06:40.800> one<00:06:40.950> star<00:06:41.190> you<00:06:41.340> really<00:06:41.580> want

00:06:41.750 --> 00:06:41.760 
there that has one star you really want

00:06:41.760 --> 00:06:43.580 
there that has one star you really want
a<00:06:41.820> two<00:06:42.000> star<00:06:42.270> every<00:06:42.600> single<00:06:42.870> town<00:06:43.050> all<00:06:43.200> ten<00:06:43.410> and

00:06:43.580 --> 00:06:43.590 
a two star every single town all ten and

00:06:43.590 --> 00:06:45.350 
a two star every single town all ten and
we<00:06:43.950> left<00:06:44.190> a<00:06:44.280> couple<00:06:44.520> of<00:06:44.640> stars<00:06:44.880> on<00:06:45.030> the<00:06:45.120> board

00:06:45.350 --> 00:06:45.360 
we left a couple of stars on the board

00:06:45.360 --> 00:06:47.120 
we left a couple of stars on the board
so<00:06:45.600> there's<00:06:45.750> three<00:06:46.050> four<00:06:46.470> bases<00:06:46.860> that<00:06:46.980> only

00:06:47.120 --> 00:06:47.130 
so there's three four bases that only

00:06:47.130 --> 00:06:49.370 
so there's three four bases that only
got<00:06:47.310> one<00:06:47.490> star<00:06:47.700> five<00:06:48.270> bases<00:06:48.780> that<00:06:48.960> only<00:06:49.170> got

00:06:49.370 --> 00:06:49.380 
got one star five bases that only got

00:06:49.380 --> 00:06:51.590 
got one star five bases that only got
one<00:06:49.560> star<00:06:49.770> at<00:06:50.010> Town<00:06:50.190> Hall<00:06:50.220> ten<00:06:50.580> taking<00:06:51.360> a<00:06:51.420> look

00:06:51.590 --> 00:06:51.600 
one star at Town Hall ten taking a look

00:06:51.600 --> 00:06:53.240 
one star at Town Hall ten taking a look
at<00:06:51.660> the<00:06:51.750> Town<00:06:51.930> Hall<00:06:51.960> 9<00:06:52.290> do<00:06:52.620> you<00:06:52.710> really<00:06:53.040> need<00:06:53.160> to

be able to pull off some three stars and

00:06:54.720 --> 00:06:56.570 
be able to pull off some three stars and
we<00:06:55.110> were<00:06:55.230> only<00:06:55.380> able<00:06:55.560> to<00:06:55.860> get<00:06:56.010> three<00:06:56.370> three

00:06:56.570 --> 00:06:56.580 
we were only able to get three three

00:06:56.580 --> 00:06:58.370 
we were only able to get three three
star<00:06:56.880> attacks<00:06:57.270> there<00:06:57.510> were<00:06:57.600> a<00:06:57.630> lot<00:06:57.870> of<00:06:57.900> really

00:06:58.370 --> 00:06:58.380 
star attacks there were a lot of really

00:06:58.380 --> 00:07:01.520 
star attacks there were a lot of really
close<00:06:58.530> raids<00:06:58.890> 95<00:06:59.760> percent<00:07:00.120> 97<00:07:00.450> percent<00:07:01.020> 99

00:07:01.520 --> 00:07:01.530 
close raids 95 percent 97 percent 99

00:07:01.530 --> 00:07:03.320 
close raids 95 percent 97 percent 99
percent<00:07:02.010> like<00:07:02.160> the<00:07:02.280> one<00:07:02.400> I<00:07:02.430> showed<00:07:02.700> you<00:07:02.760> but

00:07:03.320 --> 00:07:03.330 
percent like the one I showed you but

00:07:03.330 --> 00:07:04.610 
percent like the one I showed you but
unfortunately<00:07:03.480> we<00:07:03.900> weren't<00:07:04.050> able<00:07:04.170> to<00:07:04.380> pull<00:07:04.530> it

00:07:04.610 --> 00:07:04.620 
unfortunately we weren't able to pull it

00:07:04.620 --> 00:07:06.410 
unfortunately we weren't able to pull it
off<00:07:04.710> whereas<00:07:05.100> if<00:07:05.220> you<00:07:05.310> look<00:07:05.340> at<00:07:05.580> our<00:07:05.730> base<00:07:05.970> they

00:07:06.410 --> 00:07:06.420 
off whereas if you look at our base they

00:07:06.420 --> 00:07:08.000 
off whereas if you look at our base they
three<00:07:06.690> start<00:07:06.930> all<00:07:07.080> over<00:07:07.110> town<00:07:07.470> all<00:07:07.500> eight<00:07:07.800> so

00:07:08.000 --> 00:07:08.010 
three start all over town all eight so

00:07:08.010 --> 00:07:09.170 
three start all over town all eight so
you<00:07:08.070> can<00:07:08.250> see<00:07:08.460> they<00:07:08.640> had<00:07:08.760> four<00:07:09.060> or<00:07:09.150> five

00:07:09.170 --> 00:07:09.180 
you can see they had four or five

00:07:09.180 --> 00:07:11.060 
you can see they had four or five
there's<00:07:09.960> a<00:07:10.050> six<00:07:10.410> right<00:07:10.620> there<00:07:10.650> there's<00:07:11.010> a

00:07:11.060 --> 00:07:11.070 
there's a six right there there's a

00:07:11.070 --> 00:07:12.860 
there's a six right there there's a
seven<00:07:11.490> so<00:07:11.670> they<00:07:11.790> three<00:07:12.180> started<00:07:12.480> all<00:07:12.630> of<00:07:12.780> our

00:07:12.860 --> 00:07:12.870 
seven so they three started all of our

00:07:12.870 --> 00:07:15.230 
seven so they three started all of our

turning points of this war is they to
start<00:07:17.100> every<00:07:17.610> single<00:07:17.970> one<00:07:18.120> of<00:07:18.180> our<00:07:18.360> town<00:07:18.570> all

00:07:18.740 --> 00:07:18.750 
start every single one of our town all

00:07:18.750 --> 00:07:20.540 
start every single one of our town all
tens<00:07:18.960> they<00:07:19.560> really<00:07:20.010> did<00:07:20.160> an<00:07:20.250> awesome<00:07:20.340> job

00:07:20.540 --> 00:07:20.550 
tens they really did an awesome job

00:07:20.550 --> 00:07:22.490 
tens they really did an awesome job
attacking<00:07:21.120> our<00:07:21.210> town<00:07:21.420> all<00:07:21.570> ten<00:07:21.810> so<00:07:22.020> in<00:07:22.200> the<00:07:22.350> end

attacking our town all ten so in the end
I<00:07:22.710> really<00:07:23.220> do<00:07:23.340> think<00:07:23.580> the<00:07:23.640> better<00:07:23.790> clan<00:07:24.090> one

unfortunately even though their bases
were<00:07:25.919> a<00:07:25.950> lot<00:07:26.130> better<00:07:26.280> than<00:07:26.550> us<00:07:26.669> they<00:07:26.880> were<00:07:26.940> able

00:07:27.230 --> 00:07:27.240 
were a lot better than us they were able

00:07:27.240 --> 00:07:29.600 
were a lot better than us they were able
to<00:07:27.390> to<00:07:27.690> start<00:07:27.960> every<00:07:28.230> single<00:07:28.530> one<00:07:28.710> of<00:07:28.890> our<00:07:29.400> town
