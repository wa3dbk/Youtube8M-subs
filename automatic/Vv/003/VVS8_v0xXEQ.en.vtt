a paper crossbow with a paper trigger to

00:00:10.660 --> 00:00:14.760 
a paper crossbow with a paper trigger to
it<00:00:11.020> also<00:00:11.320> yeah<00:00:12.190> has<00:00:13.090> a<00:00:13.120> paper<00:00:13.720> a<00:00:14.080> good<00:00:14.260> nice

00:00:14.760 --> 00:00:14.770 
it also yeah has a paper a good nice

00:00:14.770 --> 00:00:19.770 
it also yeah has a paper a good nice
paper<00:00:15.130> trigger<00:00:15.580> um<00:00:17.190> so<00:00:18.190> far<00:00:18.760> show<00:00:19.030> you<00:00:19.090> it<00:00:19.390> and

00:00:34.590 --> 00:00:34.600 
electrical tape better so and then

00:00:34.600 --> 00:00:40.040 
electrical tape better so and then
here's<00:00:34.839> the<00:00:34.929> trigger<00:00:35.440> um<00:00:36.449> you<00:00:37.449> can<00:00:38.249> make<00:00:39.249> a

then<00:01:57.700> you're<00:01:58.700> going<00:01:58.880> to<00:01:59.000> get<00:02:00.070> another<00:02:01.070> piece

00:02:01.590 --> 00:02:01.600 
then you're going to get another piece

00:02:01.600 --> 00:02:04.749 
then you're going to get another piece
and<00:02:02.600> roll<00:02:02.810> it<00:02:02.990> up<00:02:03.110> pretty<00:02:03.470> tight<00:02:03.590> like<00:02:04.340> I<00:02:04.520> said

00:02:11.890 --> 00:02:24.270 
for don't have to be super tight top
knot<00:02:12.890> and<00:02:13.880> then<00:02:16.030> like<00:02:17.030> this<00:02:17.920> put<00:02:18.920> all<00:02:19.010> of<00:02:19.040> them

00:02:24.270 --> 00:02:24.280 

00:02:24.280 --> 00:02:31.690 

that<00:02:25.780> um<00:02:27.910> so<00:02:28.910> so<00:02:29.870> far<00:02:30.200> it's<00:02:30.410> just<00:02:30.590> like<00:02:31.489> that

00:02:31.690 --> 00:02:31.700 
that um so so far it's just like that

00:02:31.700 --> 00:02:35.380 
that um so so far it's just like that
and<00:02:31.940> then<00:02:33.130> you're<00:02:34.130> going<00:02:34.280> to<00:02:34.370> get<00:02:34.549> another<00:02:35.030> two

00:02:35.380 --> 00:02:35.390 
and then you're going to get another two

00:02:35.390 --> 00:02:51.280 
and then you're going to get another two
pieces<00:02:35.810> of<00:02:35.840> paper<00:02:44.260> just<00:02:45.260> like<00:02:45.380> that<00:02:50.080> so<00:02:51.080> then

00:02:51.280 --> 00:02:51.290 
pieces of paper just like that so then

00:02:51.290 --> 00:02:56.170 
pieces of paper just like that so then
you<00:02:51.470> just<00:02:51.680> keep<00:02:52.720> it<00:02:53.720> together<00:02:53.989> like<00:02:55.180> crossbow

00:02:56.170 --> 00:02:56.180 
you just keep it together like crossbow

00:02:56.180 --> 00:02:59.410 
you just keep it together like crossbow
if<00:02:57.019> you<00:02:57.200> already<00:02:57.319> know<00:02:57.650> that<00:02:58.000> you<00:02:59.000> just<00:02:59.150> keep

00:02:59.410 --> 00:02:59.420 
if you already know that you just keep

00:02:59.420 --> 00:03:03.670 
if you already know that you just keep
that<00:02:59.690> on<00:02:59.840> really<00:03:00.079> nice<00:03:00.500> and<00:03:01.430> then<00:03:01.790> you<00:03:01.970> can<00:03:02.680> put

00:03:03.670 --> 00:03:03.680 
that on really nice and then you can put

00:03:03.680 --> 00:03:11.530 
that on really nice and then you can put
some<00:03:04.540> board<00:03:07.959> right<00:03:08.959> here<00:03:09.430> but<00:03:10.430> it<00:03:11.000> takes<00:03:11.329> a

00:03:11.530 --> 00:03:11.540 
some board right here but it takes a

00:03:11.540 --> 00:03:13.840 
some board right here but it takes a
while<00:03:11.750> so<00:03:12.260> that's<00:03:12.890> why<00:03:13.100> I<00:03:13.130> didn't<00:03:13.670> make<00:03:13.819> it

00:03:13.840 --> 00:03:13.850 
while so that's why I didn't make it

00:03:13.850 --> 00:03:17.890 
while so that's why I didn't make it
with<00:03:14.090> you<00:03:14.269> guys<00:03:14.350> sorry<00:03:15.350> but<00:03:15.680> took<00:03:16.430> too<00:03:16.790> long<00:03:16.900> it

00:03:17.890 --> 00:03:17.900 
with you guys sorry but took too long it

00:03:17.900 --> 00:03:20.590 
with you guys sorry but took too long it
would<00:03:18.200> take<00:03:18.230> too<00:03:18.620> long<00:03:18.650> so<00:03:19.100> I<00:03:19.370> hope<00:03:20.269> that

00:03:20.590 --> 00:03:20.600 
would take too long so I hope that

00:03:20.600 --> 00:03:26.440
