00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.780
 hi today I want to talk about a topic 

00:00:01.800 --> 00:00:06.359
 controversial consuming sea water 

00:00:03.780 --> 00:00:07.890
 consuming sea water is something that we 

00:00:06.359 --> 00:00:09.750
 teaches that we should not do that is going to 

00:00:07.890 --> 00:00:11.759
 falling bad is bad for our health 

00:00:09.750 --> 00:00:13.320
 going to give nausea that we're going to throw up 

00:00:11.759 --> 00:00:15.389
 is going to give diarrhea that we can die 

00:00:13.320 --> 00:00:17.119
 that we're going to go crazy and that's 

00:00:15.389 --> 00:00:19.560
 Something true if you are in a boat 

00:00:17.119 --> 00:00:21.510
 sinking and you only consume sea water 

00:00:19.560 --> 00:00:24.119
 logical you're going to go crazy you're not going to 

00:00:21.510 --> 00:00:27.029
 can synthesize metabolize the sea 

00:00:24.119 --> 00:00:29.310
 It contains salts not only common salt of 

00:00:27.029 --> 00:00:31.260
 table that is refined and toxic 

00:00:29.310 --> 00:00:33.690
 contains salts have potassium has 

00:00:31.260 --> 00:00:36.390
 magnesium has salts of epsom has iodine 

00:00:33.690 --> 00:00:39.750
 has salt is a set of salts not 

00:00:36.390 --> 00:00:42.840
 only the sodium reaction 

00:00:39.750 --> 00:00:44.610
 with chlorine that chemical reaction that is 

00:00:42.840 --> 00:00:47.320
 common table salt has more salts 

00:00:44.610 --> 00:00:50.650
 important for health 

00:00:47.320 --> 00:00:53.230
 Many times we think that we should not 

00:00:50.650 --> 00:00:54.670
 consume sea salt by the per 

00:00:53.230 --> 00:00:57.280
 things that they have told us but in reality 

00:00:54.670 --> 00:00:58.629
 although the sea has 3.5 percent of 

00:00:57.280 --> 00:01:01.600
 salt while human blood has 

00:00:58.629 --> 00:01:03.760
 0 points 9 percent salt 33 times 

00:01:01.600 --> 00:01:04.720
 more than 3 times more salt than there is in the 

00:01:03.760 --> 00:01:06.430
 sea that in human blood 

00:01:04.720 --> 00:01:08.950
 the proportion of minerals is almost 

00:01:06.430 --> 00:01:10.840
 identical this gives us a clue because the 

00:01:08.950 --> 00:01:13.060
 Sea has a proportion of minerals 

00:01:10.840 --> 00:01:14.580
 identical to the human being our body is 

00:01:13.060 --> 00:01:17.110
 because there is something for us 

00:01:14.580 --> 00:01:20.680
 consume the nutrients in a 

00:01:17.110 --> 00:01:22.869
 individual that as table salt is not 

00:01:20.680 --> 00:01:24.820
 it's something beneficial to manage it from 

00:01:22.869 --> 00:01:27.399
 that way the nutrients are not consumed 

00:01:24.820 --> 00:01:29.560
 together in a group is the natural way 

00:01:27.399 --> 00:01:31.479
 that what the sea has and what I 

00:01:29.560 --> 00:01:33.850
 I propose is to consume sea water 

00:01:31.479 --> 00:01:35.979
 diluting by diluting a spoonful of 

00:01:33.850 --> 00:01:38.890
 sea ​​water in a glass of water water 

00:01:35.979 --> 00:01:40.720
 common in this way is like a remedy 

00:01:38.890 --> 00:01:43.270
 homeopathic the more you dilute it is 

00:01:40.720 --> 00:01:46.440
 easier to metabolize the 

00:01:43.270 --> 00:01:48.840
 synthesize it from power 

00:01:46.440 --> 00:01:50.850
 bring those nutrients from the sea to our 

00:01:48.840 --> 00:01:53.250
 body that detoxifying effect of the sea 

00:01:50.850 --> 00:01:55.590
 to our whole body what I propose 

00:01:53.250 --> 00:01:57.450
 because we just do not metabolize well 

00:01:55.590 --> 00:02:00.060
 the salt for missing us minerals by 

00:01:57.450 --> 00:02:02.580
 having a poor diet is first having 

00:02:00.060 --> 00:02:04.200
 a diet rich in the vegetable world in 

00:02:02.580 --> 00:02:05.760
 vegetables in fruit 

00:02:04.200 --> 00:02:08.310
 that is going to bring us the minerals that 

00:02:05.760 --> 00:02:10.070
 we need potassium the phosphorus that 

00:02:08.310 --> 00:02:12.900
 we need to metabolize the salt 

00:02:10.070 --> 00:02:16.650
 then super spirulina food 

00:02:12.900 --> 00:02:20.040
 chlorella pollen maca super foods and 

00:02:16.650 --> 00:02:21.540
 fats with omega 3 chia flaxseed and fats 

00:02:20.040 --> 00:02:23.670
 with omega 6 as the avocado fats 

00:02:21.540 --> 00:02:27.480
 beneficial that + expose 

00:02:23.670 --> 00:02:29.790
 daily in the sun that's what's going 

00:02:27.480 --> 00:02:33.480
 allow to enjoy the benefits of 

00:02:29.790 --> 00:02:35.340
 consume sea water sea water this 

00:02:33.480 --> 00:02:37.980
 brings benefits for our health 

00:02:35.340 --> 00:02:40.200
 many for the immune system to 

00:02:37.980 --> 00:02:43.360
 the one that when starting the blood for asthma 

00:02:40.200 --> 00:02:45.210
 and other allergies, even for the skin 

00:02:43.360 --> 00:02:47.800
 to lose weight for the heart 

00:02:45.210 --> 00:02:49.870
 many benefits of sea salt from 

00:02:47.800 --> 00:02:52.680
 sea ​​water in our body so 

00:02:49.870 --> 00:02:52.680
