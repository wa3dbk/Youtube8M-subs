00:00:23.880 --> 00:00:26.970
 Sinthon is a very legal condition. 

00:00:25.680 --> 00:00:28.860
 interesting episode for you that 

00:00:26.970 --> 00:00:30.750
 whether or not they are going up or not 

00:00:28.860 --> 00:00:33.210
 Betting was a very cool thing to do. 

00:00:30.750 --> 00:00:35.520
 really cute, really cool and 

00:00:33.210 --> 00:00:37.110
 Share a map to show textures is 

00:00:35.520 --> 00:00:39.000
 so a very cool thing that I 

00:00:37.110 --> 00:00:40.589
 I usually make the channel so this is a 

00:00:39.000 --> 00:00:41.339
 mistake that mannequin uses he is very 

00:00:40.589 --> 00:00:42.600
 Light 

00:00:41.339 --> 00:00:44.999
 Just as it's still very heavy 

00:00:42.600 --> 00:00:46.469
 It turned out he's locking up like this. 

00:00:44.999 --> 00:00:48.449
 I believe it will not be wiped off the map and 

00:00:46.469 --> 00:00:49.589
 then the first time the 

00:00:48.449 --> 00:00:51.089
 Iran was a good student in daycare for 

00:00:49.589 --> 00:00:52.559
 keep sp 

00:00:51.089 --> 00:00:55.050
 the camera has not seen for a long time 

00:00:52.559 --> 00:00:56.940
 another goal and this is also the golem 

00:00:55.050 --> 00:00:59.219
 of snow that is very cute too 

00:00:56.940 --> 00:01:01.019
 for calling him clerisvaldo surroundings 

00:00:59.219 --> 00:01:03.030
 clerisvald and dangerous and they have a 

00:01:01.019 --> 00:01:04.530
 definition was a really cool thing to do. 

00:01:03.030 --> 00:01:05.700
 the guy who created years was a guy 

00:01:04.530 --> 00:01:07.350
 too much germany then leave here 

00:01:05.700 --> 00:01:09.659
 underneath his channel for you guys 

00:01:07.350 --> 00:01:11.190
 see also is actually twitter 

00:01:09.659 --> 00:01:13.619
 so you go there on his twitter if he 

00:01:11.190 --> 00:01:14.820
 because it's so fucking mary guy and only 

00:01:13.619 --> 00:01:16.619
 because he 's really cool because he 

00:01:14.820 --> 00:01:18.119
 shows all the blocks and shows you 

00:01:16.619 --> 00:01:19.920
 also the functionality these things yes 

00:01:18.119 --> 00:01:21.180
 It's really cool to show you 

00:01:19.920 --> 00:01:23.369
 structure and also to test some 

00:01:21.180 --> 00:01:25.229
 censorship on your map - and not 

00:01:23.369 --> 00:01:26.820
 recording videos so I know that the whole 

00:01:25.229 --> 00:01:27.420
 flora of a nursery all things and 

00:01:26.820 --> 00:01:30.780
 such 

00:01:27.420 --> 00:01:32.130
 so really cool and beauty then and 

00:01:30.780 --> 00:01:33.240
 until the old pumpkin which is very 

00:01:32.130 --> 00:01:36.090
 cool same also has some blocks 

00:01:33.240 --> 00:01:37.950
 Random means taking on order at the end 

00:01:36.090 --> 00:01:39.420
 ended up showing all the blocks right 

00:01:37.950 --> 00:01:40.829
 and I want to feel a background noise for 

00:01:39.420 --> 00:01:42.719
 cause the rain then I'm really sorry 

00:01:40.829 --> 00:01:45.210
 because it's something that has no way 

00:01:42.719 --> 00:01:46.859
 taking a lot of nature then each 

00:01:45.210 --> 00:01:48.270
 camera and fifth blocks even this map 

00:01:46.859 --> 00:01:50.189
 that he was created thinking that knowing 

00:01:48.270 --> 00:01:52.350
 I'm sick at day care to show all 

00:01:50.189 --> 00:01:55.289
 boxes all the new things you have 

00:01:52.350 --> 00:01:56.640
 So, what is it anyway, I would like 

00:01:55.289 --> 00:01:57.920
 also show the things that there 

00:01:56.640 --> 00:02:00.509
 There's a lot of really interesting stuff. 

00:01:57.920 --> 00:02:02.490
 It's very cool, right? 

00:02:00.509 --> 00:02:04.170
 He talks too much is not going to be a problem. 

00:02:02.490 --> 00:02:06.030
 started there are like the delivery after the 

00:02:04.170 --> 00:02:08.130
 Pomegranate in the end there to have a little 

00:02:06.030 --> 00:02:09.509
 corridor is that it has nothing but the 

00:02:08.130 --> 00:02:11.790
 Old and old are some things here. 

00:02:09.509 --> 00:02:14.010
 in the case that all the 

00:02:11.790 --> 00:02:15.690
 furniture a day care in case is a bible 

00:02:14.010 --> 00:02:17.430
 death involving well yesterday several ways 

00:02:15.690 --> 00:02:18.180
 Here I want it to be a little bit. 

00:02:17.430 --> 00:02:19.950
 said that only 

00:02:18.180 --> 00:02:21.480
 I do not believe it but it 's one thing 

00:02:19.950 --> 00:02:23.700
 very cool too because some 

00:02:21.480 --> 00:02:25.650
 Not all textures but some only 

00:02:23.700 --> 00:02:27.569
 they change the texture of the furniture so it is 

00:02:25.650 --> 00:02:28.980
 well cool even then I know everyone 

00:02:27.569 --> 00:02:30.629
 the blocks until if katia that is very 

00:02:28.980 --> 00:02:33.180
 cute and old is very 

00:02:30.629 --> 00:02:34.530
 interesting indeed and beauty directed 

00:02:33.180 --> 00:02:36.900
 censorship because it is more to show the 

00:02:34.530 --> 00:02:38.909
 map - where we also have this part here 

00:02:36.900 --> 00:02:40.769
 of something that is very interesting old 

00:02:38.909 --> 00:02:43.409
 here now have a sip actually Neitiznot 

00:02:40.769 --> 00:02:44.879
 this is the goal of nene new car 

00:02:43.409 --> 00:02:47.069
 here's a little bit war too 

00:02:44.879 --> 00:02:49.230
 I even killed this one and killed it. 

00:02:47.069 --> 00:02:51.299
 It's quietly very interesting. 

00:02:49.230 --> 00:02:52.739
 old thing I found the map well 

00:02:51.299 --> 00:02:55.260
 cool because usually when you showed 

00:02:52.739 --> 00:02:56.489
 texture showed any report 

00:02:55.260 --> 00:02:58.769
 because I did not have a fixed map, right? 

00:02:56.489 --> 00:03:00.870
 galley that is only from the biomes 

00:02:58.769 --> 00:03:02.400
 then everyone is here in one nursery 

00:03:00.870 --> 00:03:04.049
 very cool thing to show 

00:03:02.400 --> 00:03:07.019
 It's even kind of like a company. 

00:03:04.049 --> 00:03:08.969
 even this time on the map is 

00:03:07.019 --> 00:03:10.769
 much more interesting, huh? 

00:03:08.969 --> 00:03:13.139
 the rotary in the charts because they are 

00:03:10.769 --> 00:03:14.549
 to arrive on time everyone is not like her 

00:03:13.139 --> 00:03:15.930
 is running very well in daycare is 

00:03:14.549 --> 00:03:17.519
 very heavy right 

00:03:15.930 --> 00:03:20.010
 and it was worth a fuckin 'door 

00:03:17.519 --> 00:03:20.819
 he is a little heavy even I have 

00:03:20.010 --> 00:03:23.159
 Let's talk because he's a little 

00:03:20.819 --> 00:03:25.139
 heavy but anyway it's really fucking same 

00:03:23.159 --> 00:03:26.549
 beauty then no small cut that only 

00:03:25.139 --> 00:03:29.099
 three ranges even give a small cut 

00:03:26.549 --> 00:03:30.930
 stay at the end of the map and the young half 

00:03:29.099 --> 00:03:32.639
 hour since he filmed it is very bad 

00:03:30.930 --> 00:03:34.530
 even human chalice well end 

00:03:32.639 --> 00:03:36.750
 map in his case he is very cool 

00:03:34.530 --> 00:03:38.250
 It 's really liking, it 's really fucking cool. 

00:03:36.750 --> 00:03:40.019
 a little bit of mine will grow too 

00:03:38.250 --> 00:03:42.269
 old man with his stimulating kind of a 

00:03:40.019 --> 00:03:43.739
 mine is really cool and I really want 

00:03:42.269 --> 00:03:45.120
 we work even dumber 

00:03:43.739 --> 00:03:47.069
 research what is happening human 

00:03:45.120 --> 00:03:48.599
 Because nothing's too much to worry about. 

00:03:47.069 --> 00:03:50.430
 Assembly with these also a 

00:03:48.599 --> 00:03:52.739
 a little there then it's a very thing 

00:03:50.430 --> 00:03:54.629
 cool same beauty then here we too 

00:03:52.739 --> 00:03:56.819
 we have a little bit in that library is 

00:03:54.629 --> 00:03:58.290
 when it 's going prudent you 

00:03:56.819 --> 00:03:59.159
 businesses also find that their 

00:03:58.290 --> 00:04:00.870
 friends, right? 

00:03:59.159 --> 00:04:02.549
 until I put a torch just to stay 

00:04:00.870 --> 00:04:03.810
 more realistic it is also necessary to be a 

00:04:02.549 --> 00:04:05.939
 little better than the mine is very cool 

00:04:03.810 --> 00:04:06.629
 zinho same afternoon was very equal and 

00:04:05.939 --> 00:04:08.250
 nursery 

00:04:06.629 --> 00:04:10.680
 I think they simulated very well even for 

00:04:08.250 --> 00:04:12.180
 stay the same as yours on a board 

00:04:10.680 --> 00:04:14.189
 so basically all this gathered 

00:04:12.180 --> 00:04:16.500
 aquino after the old county is like this 

00:04:14.189 --> 00:04:18.900
 taking everything and decided to put a shovel 

00:04:16.500 --> 00:04:20.310
 only I think they exported from ps and not 

00:04:18.900 --> 00:04:21.900
 case of the program did everything and then 

00:04:20.310 --> 00:04:24.030

00:04:21.900 --> 00:04:26.099
 one thing will do well and one 

00:04:24.030 --> 00:04:27.990
 very simple thing to do too 

00:04:26.099 --> 00:04:29.550

00:04:27.990 --> 00:04:30.990
