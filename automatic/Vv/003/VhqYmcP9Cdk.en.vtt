00:00:06.550 --> 00:00:15.290
 10 cm in height Weight 76 kg is a game sadowsky to other Dorakon players 

00:00:12.760 --> 00:00:19.600
 8 to 20 cm smaller than 

00:00:15.290 --> 00:00:19.600
 Weight is also light up to 48 kg 

00:00:22.130 --> 00:00:27.369
 Still driver distance of them will exceed 455 yards 

00:00:28.380 --> 00:00:37.550
 His swing is of the things that break through the thickness thin 1.6 centimeters of plywood in purple terrifying 

00:00:34.530 --> 00:00:37.550
 I shoot a tea shot 

00:00:41.890 --> 00:00:47.190
 ug 5 

00:00:43.340 --> 00:00:53.340
 How can we get the head to run there ? 

00:00:47.190 --> 00:00:54.630
 Most of my body is flexible I am petite, so it is very important to make the most of flexibility 

00:00:53.340 --> 00:00:59.670
 is 

00:00:54.630 --> 00:01:05.010
 Flexibility is two months how to generate a high registration in swing 

00:00:59.670 --> 00:01:11.700
 Because 6 is produced from the year centered on the spine 

00:01:05.010 --> 00:01:14.680
 The higher the waist and shoulders, the larger the x factor, the higher the effort itself and the more intense it is 

00:01:11.700 --> 00:01:18.100
 It means that the set speed is considered 

00:01:14.680 --> 00:01:24.160
 While jv orphans rotate 49 degrees 

00:01:18.100 --> 00:01:25.180
 The rotation of the shoulder is even 166 degrees so the x factor of the day before is 117 degrees 

00:01:24.160 --> 00:01:30.630
 Will be 

00:01:25.180 --> 00:01:34.680
 This will be to listen to 58% better way than the general professional golfers 

00:01:30.630 --> 00:01:37.430
 In an experiment using a typographical sensor, his list speed is indeed every second 

00:01:34.680 --> 00:01:37.430
 2100 

00:01:41.210 --> 00:01:47.110
 Jamie wrist of strength and speed does not take the sink to hockey player 

00:01:50.280 --> 00:02:00.030
 Head speed is a whopping per second 66m 

00:01:54.010 --> 00:02:00.030
 This will come to a page and the average for the pro will be 20% over 

00:02:00.330 --> 00:02:03.760
 Viel Pocky 

00:02:02.479 --> 00:02:09.640
 nip 

00:02:03.760 --> 00:02:13.680
 Doropon such as j 3 complete recovery is 3-inch than the driver of the normal 45 inches Nagae 

00:02:09.640 --> 00:02:20.659
 Such as 47 inches will use the club 

00:02:13.680 --> 00:02:20.659
 This can increase the linear speed of the club head by more than 4% 

00:02:23.470 --> 00:02:29.860
 The secret of the marvelous distance of j 3 is just because you are using a long club 

00:02:28.240 --> 00:02:37.180
 not 

00:02:29.860 --> 00:02:40.989
 It is amazing to record 288 yards in shape according to the swing radar 

00:02:37.180 --> 00:02:46.019
 This is one driver average distance prefer but one pj 

00:02:40.989 --> 00:02:53.709
 3 You just do not have enough yard and one of the dj name is say how much by far 

00:02:46.019 --> 00:02:56.680
 In the case of pga tour professional average Kyarinwa 277 Yati where there is j Munoz Well 

00:02:53.709 --> 00:03:01.829
 It is calculation that cab is not good 

00:02:56.680 --> 00:03:01.829
 espn so science john pudding or sky shared
