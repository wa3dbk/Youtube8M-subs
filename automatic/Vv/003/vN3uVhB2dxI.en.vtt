 the ages you have to follow them 

00:00:20.630 --> 00:00:24.760
 the brands of success do so 

00:00:27.450 --> 00:00:32.410
 because I work I must travel with

00:00:57.879 --> 00:01:04.140
 Stayin very well I would choose clothes 

00:01:01.600 --> 00:01:07.390
 a little more 

00:01:04.140 --> 00:01:10.180
 simple and more sober and one more color 

00:01:07.390 --> 00:01:12.610
 cold would start from a basic that is the 

00:01:10.180 --> 00:01:15.340
 basic that I always recommend to all 

00:01:12.610 --> 00:01:17.110
 women that is the basic art that 

00:01:15.340 --> 00:01:18.570

00:01:20.710 --> 00:01:26.619
 office by your skin tone and your tone of 

00:01:23.680 --> 00:01:29.740
 hair is cute, this ocher is golden 

00:01:26.619 --> 00:01:32.140
 It's an old gold. Look, this does not have 

00:01:29.740 --> 00:01:34.869
 climate is a high and low that jump 

00:01:32.140 --> 00:01:36.970
 go long back and that's going to 

00:01:34.869 --> 00:01:39.009
 stylize and lengthen the torso 

00:01:36.970 --> 00:01:42.159
 there is no executive that is respected that 

00:01:39.009 --> 00:01:44.409
 do not need a trench the 3t works in 

00:01:42.159 --> 00:01:46.240
 Medellin that works in Bogota if you go 

00:01:44.409 --> 00:01:49.240
 for the coast you put it at the bottom of your 

00:01:46.240 --> 00:01:52.030
 suitcase but you should always go wrapped 

00:01:49.240 --> 00:01:55.179
 protected by a gabardine we are going to 

00:01:52.030 --> 00:01:57.369

00:01:57.369 --> 00:02:02.640
 we can fuck you for that pint and we 

00:01:59.710 --> 00:02:02.640
 we see in investigating myself 

00:02:02.730 --> 00:02:07.770
 This satin shine of light is ideal 

00:02:05.850 --> 00:02:10.860
 to live for at night but if you're 

00:02:07.770 --> 00:02:12.330
 in your house a cycle in your city but 

00:02:10.860 --> 00:02:14.250
 to put a suitcase that will arrive 

00:02:12.330 --> 00:02:15.990
 so this is you can not get to a 

00:02:14.250 --> 00:02:18.120
 together with a presentation of a project 

00:02:15.990 --> 00:02:18.810
 because you're going to look wrinkly this is not 

00:02:18.120 --> 00:02:20.880
 what you want 

00:02:18.810 --> 00:02:23.730
 instead, the pants travel well on 

00:02:20.880 --> 00:02:25.740
 pants is an ideal pants with a 

00:02:23.730 --> 00:02:28.740
 tendency to continue without being lady because 

00:02:25.740 --> 00:02:31.020
 gives you has acquires a different status 

00:02:28.740 --> 00:02:33.030
 by zippers divinely the 

00:02:31.020 --> 00:02:35.940
 Zip pockets the cloth radio 

00:02:33.030 --> 00:02:38.370
 chalk that thins the thigh you dress me 

00:02:35.940 --> 00:02:39.900
 I advise half but show me your 

00:02:38.370 --> 00:02:41.760
 second choice because an executive 

00:02:39.900 --> 00:02:44.820
 It has to look good in all climates 

00:02:41.760 --> 00:02:47.070
 and at all hours there you have a sophism of 

00:02:44.820 --> 00:02:48.480
 distraction if I am the interlocutor to the 

00:02:47.070 --> 00:02:50.220
 that you are going to present the project to me 

00:02:48.480 --> 00:02:53.130
 I'm going to you be thinking about how pretty 

00:02:50.220 --> 00:02:55.560
 that you see yourself in the neckline in the armhole that 

00:02:53.130 --> 00:02:57.620
 look is a look that distorts your 

00:02:55.560 --> 00:02:59.790
 seriousness to executive that rejuvenates you 

00:02:57.620 --> 00:03:03.120
 show me the pint they chose 

00:02:59.790 --> 00:03:05.790
 I'll tell you several things I'm here and 

00:03:03.120 --> 00:03:08.280

00:03:05.790 --> 00:03:11.560
 successful that launch the designers for 

00:03:08.280 --> 00:03:14.170
 then the whole horizontal the girl and 

00:03:11.560 --> 00:03:16.360
 fattens not in this case because because 

00:03:14.170 --> 00:03:18.819
 the diver is stretching the neck 

00:03:16.360 --> 00:03:21.160
 because the tone was like you see you 

00:03:18.819 --> 00:03:23.440
 you see all divine bronze look how you look 

00:03:21.160 --> 00:03:25.690
 Well this lengthens your torso and the 

00:03:23.440 --> 00:03:27.310
 light trousers that contrasts now look 

00:03:25.690 --> 00:03:31.959
 how are you going to see with the trench like this 

00:03:27.310 --> 00:03:34.570

 you see everything you used before you 

00:03:37.150 --> 00:03:42.610
 I looked fine but this is the look of a 

00:03:40.030 --> 00:03:43.870
 executive who travels a lot you're going to see 

00:03:42.610 --> 00:03:45.850
 well at any airport 

00:03:43.870 --> 00:03:50.310
