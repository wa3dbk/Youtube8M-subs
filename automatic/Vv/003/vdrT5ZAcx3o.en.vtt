00:03:16.370 --> 00:03:16.380 
different hues and you will do use the

00:03:16.380 --> 00:03:18.740 
different hues and you will do use the
basis<00:03:16.950> in<00:03:17.130> a<00:03:17.220> different<00:03:17.700> way<00:03:17.940> with<00:03:18.240> mixtures

basis in a different way with mixtures

00:03:18.750 --> 00:03:20.600

with<00:03:18.930> the<00:03:19.080> tenors<00:03:19.500> and<00:03:19.800> they<00:03:20.040> gradually

00:03:20.600 --> 00:03:20.610 
with the tenors and they gradually

00:03:20.610 --> 00:03:24.020 
with the tenors and they gradually
brought<00:03:21.000> in<00:03:21.300> like<00:03:21.510> flecks<00:03:22.200> of<00:03:22.500> light<00:03:22.560> so<00:03:23.550> you

00:03:24.020 --> 00:03:24.030 
brought in like flecks of light so you

00:03:24.030 --> 00:03:38.229 
brought in like flecks of light so you
orchestrate<00:03:24.930> with<00:03:25.260> the<00:03:25.440> choir

00:03:38.229 --> 00:03:38.239 

00:03:38.239 --> 00:03:40.759 

so<00:03:39.239> the<00:03:39.330> core<00:03:39.480> foundations<00:03:39.959> in<00:03:40.140> Oxford

00:03:40.759 --> 00:03:40.769 
so the core foundations in Oxford

00:03:40.769 --> 00:03:44.110 
so the core foundations in Oxford
have<00:03:41.069> boys<00:03:41.310> instead<00:03:41.640> of<00:03:41.730> women<00:03:42.090> and<00:03:42.440> I<00:03:43.440> think

00:03:44.110 --> 00:03:44.120 
have boys instead of women and I think

00:03:44.120 --> 00:03:46.280 
have boys instead of women and I think
the<00:03:45.120> core<00:03:45.269> foundations<00:03:45.720> are<00:03:45.840> much<00:03:45.959> older<00:03:46.110> than

00:03:46.280 --> 00:03:46.290 
the core foundations are much older than

00:03:46.290 --> 00:03:49.220 
the core foundations are much older than
the<00:03:46.470> mix<00:03:46.620> boys<00:03:46.799> choirs<00:03:47.099> and<00:03:47.370> often<00:03:48.360> were

00:03:49.220 --> 00:03:49.230 
the mix boys choirs and often were

00:03:49.230 --> 00:03:50.750 
the mix boys choirs and often were
established<00:03:49.680> with<00:03:49.769> the<00:03:50.040> colleges<00:03:50.370> some<00:03:50.519> say

00:03:50.750 --> 00:03:50.760 
established with the colleges some say

00:03:50.760 --> 00:03:52.910 
established with the colleges some say
they're<00:03:50.879> often<00:03:51.120> ancient<00:03:51.599> and<00:03:51.810> one<00:03:52.769> of<00:03:52.860> the

00:03:52.910 --> 00:03:52.920 
they're often ancient and one of the

00:03:52.920 --> 00:03:54.500 
they're often ancient and one of the
attractions<00:03:53.190> of<00:03:53.400> boys<00:03:53.610> choirs<00:03:54.000> is<00:03:54.180> the<00:03:54.299> very

00:03:54.500 --> 00:03:54.510 
attractions of boys choirs is the very

00:03:54.510 --> 00:03:57.319 
attractions of boys choirs is the very
characteristic<00:03:55.260> of<00:03:55.409> us<00:03:55.739> and<00:03:56.159> that<00:03:56.940> rappers

00:03:57.319 --> 00:03:57.329 
characteristic of us and that rappers

00:03:57.329 --> 00:03:59.390 
characteristic of us and that rappers
house<00:03:57.480> which<00:03:58.470> is<00:03:58.590> completely<00:03:58.890> different<00:03:59.069> to

00:03:59.390 --> 00:03:59.400 
house which is completely different to

00:03:59.400 --> 00:04:02.690
