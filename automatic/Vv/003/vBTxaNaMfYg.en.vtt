00:00:13.820 --> 00:00:13.830 
job according to dell from memory it

00:00:13.830 --> 00:00:17.269 
job according to dell from memory it
prints<00:00:14.240> approximately<00:00:15.240> 30<00:00:15.960> yard<00:00:16.260> pages<00:00:16.920> black

00:00:17.269 --> 00:00:17.279 
prints approximately 30 yard pages black

00:00:17.279 --> 00:00:22.550 
prints approximately 30 yard pages black
and<00:00:17.460> white<00:00:18.500> and<00:00:19.500> at<00:00:19.680> the<00:00:19.800> moment<00:00:21.289> it<00:00:22.289> sure

00:00:22.550 --> 00:00:22.560 
and white and at the moment it sure

00:00:22.560 --> 00:00:29.929 
and white and at the moment it sure
isn't<00:00:22.769> getting<00:00:23.039> that<00:00:23.279> many<00:00:24.560> so<00:00:25.560> far<00:00:25.590> we're<00:00:28.939> 30

00:00:29.929 --> 00:00:29.939 
isn't getting that many so far we're 30

00:00:29.939 --> 00:00:33.260 
isn't getting that many so far we're 30
seconds<00:00:30.539> and<00:00:31.369> it<00:00:32.369> hasn't<00:00:32.700> finished<00:00:32.880> printing

00:00:33.260 --> 00:00:33.270 
seconds and it hasn't finished printing

00:00:33.270 --> 00:00:44.360 
seconds and it hasn't finished printing
a<00:00:33.360> page<00:00:33.570> yet<00:00:36.559> so<00:00:38.899> just<00:00:39.899> filming<00:00:40.410> it<00:00:43.250> it's<00:00:44.250> going

00:00:44.360 --> 00:00:44.370 
a page yet so just filming it it's going

00:00:44.370 --> 00:00:45.950 
a page yet so just filming it it's going
to<00:00:44.430> print<00:00:44.579> three<00:00:44.940> pages<00:00:45.210> so<00:00:45.510> this<00:00:45.629> is<00:00:45.750> page

00:00:45.950 --> 00:00:45.960 
to print three pages so this is page

00:00:45.960 --> 00:00:49.580 
to print three pages so this is page
number<00:00:46.260> two<00:00:46.469> where<00:00:46.829> 45<00:00:47.610> just<00:00:48.420> over<00:00:48.690> 45<00:00:49.170> seconds

00:00:49.580 --> 00:00:49.590 
number two where 45 just over 45 seconds

00:00:49.590 --> 00:00:53.510 
number two where 45 just over 45 seconds
now<00:00:50.840> so<00:00:51.840> it's<00:00:52.020> certainly<00:00:52.350> not<00:00:52.530> 30<00:00:52.949> pages<00:00:53.309> a

00:00:53.510 --> 00:00:53.520 
now so it's certainly not 30 pages a

00:00:53.520 --> 00:01:00.619 
now so it's certainly not 30 pages a
minute<00:00:56.239> just<00:00:57.239> printing<00:00:57.570> over<00:00:57.780> whilst<00:00:59.629> but

00:01:00.619 --> 00:01:00.629 
minute just printing over whilst but

00:01:00.629 --> 00:01:02.360 
minute just printing over whilst but
I've<00:01:00.750> tried<00:01:01.140> it<00:01:01.289> through<00:01:01.440> the<00:01:01.530> USB<00:01:01.770> connection

00:01:02.360 --> 00:01:02.370 
I've tried it through the USB connection

00:01:02.370 --> 00:01:04.130 
I've tried it through the USB connection
and<00:01:02.670> it<00:01:02.789> still<00:01:03.030> prints<00:01:03.359> pretty<00:01:03.539> slowly<00:01:03.840> just

00:01:04.130 --> 00:01:04.140 
and it still prints pretty slowly just

00:01:04.140 --> 00:01:07.130 
and it still prints pretty slowly just
over<00:01:04.379> a<00:01:04.409> minute<00:01:04.559> now<00:01:04.820> and<00:01:05.840> we're<00:01:06.840> almost

00:01:07.130 --> 00:01:07.140 
over a minute now and we're almost

00:01:07.140 --> 00:01:09.080 
over a minute now and we're almost
printing<00:01:07.830> you<00:01:07.979> almost<00:01:08.159> finished<00:01:08.369> our<00:01:08.729> second

00:01:09.080 --> 00:01:09.090 
printing you almost finished our second

00:01:09.090 --> 00:01:15.980 
printing you almost finished our second
page<00:01:14.060> my<00:01:15.060> laptop's<00:01:15.509> running<00:01:15.869> out<00:01:15.960> of

00:01:15.990 --> 00:01:17.660 
page my laptop's running out of
batteries<00:01:16.439> so<00:01:16.740> we'll<00:01:17.009> see<00:01:17.220> if<00:01:17.340> it<00:01:17.460> finishes

00:01:17.660 --> 00:01:17.670 
batteries so we'll see if it finishes

00:01:17.670 --> 00:01:19.670 
batteries so we'll see if it finishes
printing<00:01:18.240> before<00:01:18.570> the<00:01:18.720> laptop<00:01:19.320> runs<00:01:19.500> out<00:01:19.650> of
