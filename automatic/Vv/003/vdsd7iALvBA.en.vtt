00:00:15.929 --> 00:00:20.699
 impressions caliph let's start with the design he 

00:00:18.690 --> 00:00:22.830
 let's say a peculiar phone has 

00:00:20.699 --> 00:00:24.199
 convex back cover and top and 

00:00:22.830 --> 00:00:26.130
 bottom ends beveled 

00:00:24.199 --> 00:00:27.990
 metal edging on the front 

00:00:26.130 --> 00:00:29.670
 panels protrudes slightly above the screen and 

00:00:27.990 --> 00:00:31.830
 not aesthetically appealing 

00:00:29.670 --> 00:00:33.750
 attractive on the other hand keep 

00:00:31.830 --> 00:00:35.820
 phone in hand is convenient to build with him 

00:00:33.750 --> 00:00:38.219
 good no creaks and no backlash 

00:00:35.820 --> 00:00:39.420
 above we see the headphone jack 

00:00:38.219 --> 00:00:42.059
 microusb bottom 

00:00:39.420 --> 00:00:43.739
 the volume rocker on the left it in Ramallah 

00:00:42.059 --> 00:00:45.780
 the power button was located and 

00:00:43.739 --> 00:00:47.969
 switch out of normal operation 

00:00:45.780 --> 00:00:50.430
 in energy saving on the back 

00:00:47.969 --> 00:00:52.770
 there is a camera and nfc module 

00:00:50.430 --> 00:00:55.410
 removing the back cover on we break there two 

00:00:52.770 --> 00:00:59.039
 slots for full-size sim-cards and slot 

00:00:55.410 --> 00:01:01.500
 for micro sd card smartphone screen in 

00:00:59.039 --> 00:01:04.890
 difference from design pleased 5 inches on 

00:01:01.500 --> 00:01:05.760
 ips matrix with a resolution of 1920 by 1080 

00:01:04.890 --> 00:01:08.520
 points 

00:01:05.760 --> 00:01:11.220
 very nice juicy colors great 

00:01:08.520 --> 00:01:13.170
 color rendering and pixels are not visible 8 and 

00:01:11.220 --> 00:01:15.299
 captivates in the phone and camera 

00:01:13.170 --> 00:01:16.680
 its resolution is 13 megapixels and 

00:01:15.299 --> 00:01:19.710
 good hardware 

00:01:16.680 --> 00:01:21.720
 give quite good photos the camera of the device is able 

00:01:19.710 --> 00:01:23.909
 focus on objects in two three 

00:01:21.720 --> 00:01:25.110
 centimeters from the lens that can far 

00:01:23.909 --> 00:01:27.270
 not every gadget 

00:01:25.110 --> 00:01:28.670
 the camera interface is generally standard 

00:01:27.270 --> 00:01:30.420
 can change white balance 

00:01:28.670 --> 00:01:32.430
 photosensitivity or adjust 

00:01:30.420 --> 00:01:34.229
 advance shooting mode technical 

00:01:32.430 --> 00:01:36.900
 characteristics are on par 

00:01:34.229 --> 00:01:39.000
 last year's top smartphones 4 

00:01:36.900 --> 00:01:40.110
 core processor with a frequency of mediatek 

00:01:39.000 --> 00:01:42.899
 one and a half gigahertz 

00:01:40.110 --> 00:01:45.299
 2 gigabytes of operative and 16 gigabytes 

00:01:42.899 --> 00:01:47.369
 domestic pony thanks to such a powerful 

00:01:45.299 --> 00:01:49.350
 stuffing smartphone perfectly shows itself 

00:01:47.369 --> 00:01:51.270
 when watching hd-video 

00:01:49.350 --> 00:01:52.409
 However, in games, the situation is different. 

00:01:51.270 --> 00:01:54.689
 definitely 

00:01:52.409 --> 00:01:56.520
 for example by running real racing 3 i 

00:01:54.689 --> 00:01:58.710
 faced with low frame rates in 

00:01:56.520 --> 00:02:01.079
 second for racing fast play this 

00:01:58.710 --> 00:02:03.869
 critical parameter is thought that 

00:02:01.079 --> 00:02:06.119
 problems that full hd screen resolution and 

00:02:03.869 --> 00:02:08.580
 with this smartphone user nothing 

00:02:06.119 --> 00:02:11.670
 can make a smartphone by the way works 

00:02:08.580 --> 00:02:13.799
 on classic naked android version 422 

00:02:11.670 --> 00:02:15.750
 that can not but rejoice and have 

00:02:13.799 --> 00:02:17.760
 get used to the gate of interfaces like 

00:02:15.750 --> 00:02:19.890
 for example samsung or htc 

00:02:17.760 --> 00:02:22.230
 I did not notice the brakes in the interface 

00:02:19.890 --> 00:02:24.540
 Basically, I caught a critical glitch with 

00:02:22.230 --> 00:02:26.010
 spontaneous shutdown of the screen when 

00:02:24.540 --> 00:02:26.489
 no dances with a tambourine 

00:02:26.010 --> 00:02:28.650
 helped 

00:02:26.489 --> 00:02:31.500
 I hope the manufacturer already knows this and 

00:02:28.650 --> 00:02:33.329
 problem and solves its main chip 

00:02:31.500 --> 00:02:36.060
 philips xenium smartphones have always been 

00:02:33.329 --> 00:02:38.670
 capacious battery manufacturer did not disappoint 

00:02:36.060 --> 00:02:39.930
 this time the battery capacity is 3300 

00:02:38.670 --> 00:02:42.299
 milliampere hours 

00:02:39.930 --> 00:02:44.099
 shows excellent results by 

00:02:42.299 --> 00:02:46.349
 official data smartphone lives on 

00:02:44.099 --> 00:02:49.349
 single charge 720 hours in mode 

00:02:46.349 --> 00:02:52.650
 conversation 18 battery will allow to see 

00:02:49.349 --> 00:02:54.359
 you 34 full hd film to talk and 

00:02:52.650 --> 00:02:55.920
 play standard mode 

00:02:54.359 --> 00:02:58.230
 using a smartphone can easily 

00:02:55.920 --> 00:03:00.000
 work up to two days and the mode 

00:02:58.230 --> 00:03:02.700
 energy saving can add even 

00:03:00.000 --> 00:03:04.349
 few precious life hours when 

00:03:02.700 --> 00:03:06.510
 transition to this mode by silence 

00:03:04.349 --> 00:03:07.440
 Cellular background applications are disabled 

00:03:06.510 --> 00:03:09.900
 data transfer 

00:03:07.440 --> 00:03:12.090
 And the screen brightness goes at least that 

00:03:09.900 --> 00:03:15.989
 You can say in the end about this smartphone 

00:03:12.090 --> 00:03:18.389
 philips xenium w8555 is one of 

00:03:15.989 --> 00:03:19.800
 few in top smartphones possessing 

00:03:18.389 --> 00:03:22.500
 and stubborn time life 

00:03:19.800 --> 00:03:24.870
 from the battery and a nice price of 13,000 

00:03:22.500 --> 00:03:26.820
 rubles he obviously will like those who 

00:03:24.870 --> 00:03:28.860
 travels frequently and who needs to wear 

00:03:26.820 --> 00:03:29.730

00:03:28.860 --> 00:03:32.430
 outlets 

00:03:29.730 --> 00:03:34.440
 but lovers of three-dimensional games worth 

00:03:32.430 --> 00:03:36.120
 beware of this device as well as 

00:03:34.440 --> 00:03:38.310
 lovers of good design 

00:03:36.120 --> 00:03:39.270
 but in any case the choice is yours but 

00:03:38.310 --> 00:03:41.850
