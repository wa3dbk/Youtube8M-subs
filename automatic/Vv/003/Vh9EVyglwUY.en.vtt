00:04:20.420 --> 00:04:20.430 
think that the good news is you go to a

00:04:20.430 --> 00:04:22.069 
think that the good news is you go to a

and make the rumble sound and turf the

00:04:26.160 --> 00:04:30.860 
and make the rumble sound and turf the
tires<00:04:26.370> you<00:04:26.520> can<00:04:26.580> do<00:04:26.730> that<00:04:26.880> too<00:04:29.630> all<00:04:30.630> right<00:04:30.750> so

00:04:30.860 --> 00:04:30.870 
tires you can do that too all right so

00:04:30.870 --> 00:04:32.180 
tires you can do that too all right so
let's<00:04:30.990> shaker<00:04:31.230> hood<00:04:31.470> right<00:04:31.680> there<00:04:31.860> believe<00:04:32.100> it

00:04:32.180 --> 00:04:32.190 
let's shaker hood right there believe it

00:04:32.190 --> 00:04:34.220 
let's shaker hood right there believe it
or<00:04:32.280> not<00:04:32.370> is<00:04:32.610> bolted<00:04:33.270> to<00:04:33.390> the<00:04:33.510> engine<00:04:33.870> and<00:04:34.110> so

00:04:34.220 --> 00:04:34.230 
or not is bolted to the engine and so

00:04:34.230 --> 00:04:35.180 
or not is bolted to the engine and so
that's<00:04:34.380> why<00:04:34.500> it's<00:04:34.650> called<00:04:34.770> the<00:04:34.950> shaker

00:04:35.180 --> 00:04:35.190 
that's why it's called the shaker
