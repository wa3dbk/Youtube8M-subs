00:00:11.720 --> 00:00:11.730 
which is a little bit different to a

00:00:11.730 --> 00:00:13.700

seven inches which is an inch and a half
shallower<00:05:55.240> than<00:05:55.450> most<00:06:03.300> reduce<00:06:04.300> this<00:06:04.540> we<00:06:04.780> keep

00:06:04.950 --> 00:06:04.960 
shallower than most reduce this we keep

00:06:04.960 --> 00:06:06.860 
shallower than most reduce this we keep
this<00:06:05.110> curvature<00:06:05.620> here<00:06:05.919> so<00:06:06.100> if<00:06:06.280> we<00:06:06.400> need<00:06:06.550> to

00:06:06.860 --> 00:06:06.870 
this curvature here so if we need to

00:06:06.870 --> 00:06:09.330 
this curvature here so if we need to
decrease<00:06:07.870> the<00:06:08.200> width<00:06:08.410> across<00:06:08.530> the<00:06:08.860> chest<00:06:09.160> the

00:06:09.330 --> 00:06:09.340 
decrease the width across the chest the

00:06:09.340 --> 00:06:11.040 
decrease the width across the chest the
tailor<00:06:09.580> can<00:06:09.820> still<00:06:10.030> get<00:06:10.150> a<00:06:10.180> nice<00:06:10.360> curvature<00:06:10.660> in

00:06:11.040 --> 00:06:11.050 
tailor can still get a nice curvature in

00:06:11.050 --> 00:06:13.290 
tailor can still get a nice curvature in
there<00:06:11.290> this<00:06:12.160> has<00:06:12.310> got<00:06:12.460> very<00:06:12.490> thin<00:06:12.940> plies<00:06:13.270> with

00:06:13.290 --> 00:06:13.300 
there this has got very thin plies with

00:06:13.300 --> 00:06:15.780 
there this has got very thin plies with
-<00:06:14.200> a<00:06:14.230> very<00:06:14.530> square<00:06:14.919> show<00:06:15.160> that<00:06:15.430> we<00:06:15.580> want<00:06:15.700> to

00:06:15.780 --> 00:06:15.790 
- a very square show that we want to

00:06:15.790 --> 00:06:19.320 
- a very square show that we want to
keep<00:06:15.970> it<00:06:16.120> as<00:06:16.180> soft<00:06:16.390> as<00:06:16.570> possible<00:06:18.030> anyway<00:06:19.030> I'll

00:06:19.320 --> 00:06:19.330 
keep it as soft as possible anyway I'll

00:06:19.330 --> 00:06:20.159 
keep it as soft as possible anyway I'll
get<00:06:19.540> on<00:06:19.690> with<00:06:19.840> things

00:06:20.159 --> 00:06:20.169 
get on with things

00:06:20.169 --> 00:06:25.110 
get on with things
and<00:06:20.290> I<00:06:22.950> hope<00:06:23.950> you've<00:06:24.100> enjoyed<00:06:24.400> that<00:06:24.610> hope<00:06:24.970> it

00:06:25.110 --> 00:06:25.120 
and I hope you've enjoyed that hope it

00:06:25.120 --> 00:06:28.050 
and I hope you've enjoyed that hope it
started<00:06:25.390> something<00:06:25.540> and<00:06:25.810> I<00:06:26.470> hope<00:06:26.830> to<00:06:27.520> see<00:06:27.880> a

started something and I hope to see a

00:06:28.060 --> 00:06:30.960 
started something and I hope to see a
