00:00:00.969 --> 00:00:08.200
 hello everyone again I'm from 1981 and in 

00:00:05.950 --> 00:00:12.220
 the video tutorial today I will explain 

00:00:08.200 --> 00:00:14.710
 how to solve the problems that it gives us 

00:00:12.220 --> 00:00:18.220
 our android when trying to install 

00:00:14.710 --> 00:00:20.380
 new applications like when trying 

00:00:18.220 --> 00:00:25.079
 update the applications that already 

00:00:20.380 --> 00:00:25.079
 we have in our device 

00:00:25.710 --> 00:00:31.169
 as you can see in this screenshot of 

00:00:28.199 --> 00:00:32.940
 screen has given us an error that we 

00:00:31.169 --> 00:00:35.640
 It says that the 

00:00:32.940 --> 00:00:37.710
 USB storage installation or 

00:00:35.640 --> 00:00:40.019
 on the sd card 

00:00:37.710 --> 00:00:42.690
 when this happens to us the first thing that 

00:00:40.019 --> 00:00:45.690
 What we have to do is look at ourselves 

00:00:42.690 --> 00:00:51.059
 state bar shows us a little symbol 

00:00:45.690 --> 00:00:53.460
 alert in the form of a disk that the 

00:00:51.059 --> 00:00:56.190
 which tells us that we are staying 

00:00:53.460 --> 00:00:58.769
 without storage space like 

00:00:56.190 --> 00:01:02.000
 you can see in these two captures here 

00:00:58.769 --> 00:01:04.979
 the icon appears and in this other capture 

00:01:02.000 --> 00:01:06.210
 of the screen here does not appear the same 

00:01:04.979 --> 00:01:08.840
 icon 

00:01:06.210 --> 00:01:08.840
 all right 

00:01:09.210 --> 00:01:16.590
 You can also go to storage in 

00:01:12.299 --> 00:01:19.380
 settings click on storage and 

00:01:16.590 --> 00:01:23.070
 here a space available you can see the 

00:01:19.380 --> 00:01:30.060
 total space that I have left in my htc 

00:01:23.070 --> 00:01:34.020
 wildfire and when I'm under 19 

00:01:30.060 --> 00:01:37.140
 megas starts giving problems for 

00:01:34.020 --> 00:01:40.909
 install the applications and I think the 

00:01:37.140 --> 00:01:40.909
 icon this storage space 

00:01:41.540 --> 00:01:44.960
 to tell me that I do not have storage 

00:01:43.430 --> 00:01:48.090
 available 

00:01:44.960 --> 00:01:51.000
 well then 

00:01:48.090 --> 00:01:54.869
 for them what you have to do is 

00:01:51.000 --> 00:01:58.530
 free space and to free space 

00:01:54.869 --> 00:02:03.030
 in your android there are varied forms 

00:01:58.530 --> 00:02:04.439
 to do it in which not to lengthen 

00:02:03.030 --> 00:02:09.690
 the tutorial 

00:02:04.439 --> 00:02:15.599
 I leave some tutorials made for 

00:02:09.690 --> 00:02:18.540
 that you can understand them better then nothing 

00:02:15.599 --> 00:02:23.209
 I hope that this tutorial will help you 

00:02:18.540 --> 00:02:23.209
 support and I be useful and thank you very much
