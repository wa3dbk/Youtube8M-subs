00:00:02.550 --> 00:00:04.760
 For a long time he made himself scarce 

00:00:04.760 --> 00:00:08.400
 his articles on economics in the Wall Street Journal and be mixed in with 

00:00:08.400 --> 00:00:12.570
 Russian domestic policy seemed to be more important than the question of whether it 

00:00:12.570 --> 00:00:16.330
 the first runners after b 5 or as jumpers to c 4 percent back 

00:00:17.480 --> 00:00:21.650
 Garry Kasparov still the number one in the chess world though he is the 

00:00:21.650 --> 00:00:26.130
 wm-fight against his chairs and compatriot Vladimir Kramnik lost said 

00:00:26.130 --> 00:00:28.989
 even I have myself 

00:00:28.989 --> 00:00:33.070
 the more strained one was also his appearance wine as the licking 

00:00:33.070 --> 00:00:38.019
 New Year's Tournament 1999 in the Dutch city of Wyk 

00:00:38.520 --> 00:00:41.679
 but then he swept wants a noble stormed 

00:00:41.679 --> 00:00:43.800
 over his opponents 

00:00:43.800 --> 00:00:47.410
 for the first time again a 60-year history of this tournament 

00:00:48.050 --> 00:00:50.889
 the security forces had to test the spectators 

00:00:50.889 --> 00:00:52.760
 on entering the hall 

00:00:52.760 --> 00:00:55.590
 only 4000 could be there 

00:00:55.590 --> 00:01:00.600
 as the tremendously tall Baku as the Spanish press calls its opponents 

00:01:00.600 --> 00:01:01.750
 defeated 

00:01:01.750 --> 00:01:04.809
 his masterpiece certainly the game 

00:01:04.809 --> 00:01:07.670
 against the Bulgarian Vesselin Topalov 

00:01:07.670 --> 00:01:12.090
 a previously suffering on board were through the city gate Palop ski-queen 

00:01:12.090 --> 00:01:14.579
 magnetic to perish urgent 

00:01:14.579 --> 00:01:15.890
 enemy camps 

00:01:15.890 --> 00:01:17.700
 was involved 

00:01:17.700 --> 00:01:20.520
 Kasparov had 

00:01:20.520 --> 00:01:22.430
 and that started 

00:01:22.430 --> 00:01:25.430
 the 2 defined 

00:01:26.400 --> 00:01:29.040
 the 7 the s6 

00:01:29.040 --> 00:01:30.940
 all for the Katz defense 

00:01:30.940 --> 00:01:33.100
 d2d 4 

00:01:33.100 --> 00:01:35.780
 Springer 11 6 

00:01:35.780 --> 00:01:38.340
 Jumper c3 

00:01:38.340 --> 00:01:41.280
 give 7 mg 6 

00:01:41.280 --> 00:01:43.550
 new ones for the «Tri» 

00:01:43.550 --> 00:01:48.350
 Lloyd fictitious 7 So play a casting quite in use now 

00:01:48.350 --> 00:01:52.100
 fast development was white choose Langeoog greed 

00:01:52.100 --> 00:01:54.400
 so that the 2 

00:01:54.400 --> 00:01:57.280
 c 7 c 6 

00:01:57.280 --> 00:01:59.760
 11 2 11 

00:01:59.760 --> 00:02:01.320
 b 7b lead 

00:02:01.320 --> 00:02:05.300
 So white is probably anyway on the kingside state office on the wing 

00:02:05.300 --> 00:02:06.550
 play 

00:02:06.550 --> 00:02:09.900
 also quite nice to see here the farmers tipped from Weisz 

00:02:10.539 --> 00:02:11.949
 and vice versa 

00:02:11.949 --> 00:02:13.399
 from black 

00:02:13.399 --> 00:02:15.329
 no enemy contact yet 

00:02:15.329 --> 00:02:17.709
 and yet both pretty impressive 

00:02:17.709 --> 00:02:20.589
 Springer b2b 

00:02:20.589 --> 00:02:23.599
 PI the 7th 

00:02:23.599 --> 00:02:26.229
 and now runner h6 Rome 

00:02:26.229 --> 00:02:30.019
 The tire also led to g7 swapping this defense 

00:02:30.779 --> 00:02:34.379
 Topal shot the runner the lady Norman again 

00:02:36.159 --> 00:02:37.760
 Runs to 7 

00:02:37.760 --> 00:02:41.020
 and if now the white lady had come up with the idea here in black 

00:02:41.020 --> 00:02:42.240
 Able to penetrate 

00:02:42.240 --> 00:02:45.589
 then who she is with this trend 

00:02:45.589 --> 00:02:47.879
 friendly or unfriendly again 

00:02:47.879 --> 00:02:50.879
 has been complied with 

00:02:51.669 --> 00:02:53.849
 the pricing is nothing 

00:02:53.849 --> 00:02:55.279
 and therefore 

00:02:55.279 --> 00:02:59.049
 in order to prevent one like 5b from playing four 

00:03:00.389 --> 00:03:01.420
 Kaspar often 

00:03:01.420 --> 00:03:04.319
 ORF 2 a3 

00:03:04.319 --> 00:03:07.559
 the 7 the fifth counter-attack in the center 

00:03:08.059 --> 00:03:09.629
 and now 

00:03:09.629 --> 00:03:12.489
 as planned the land Rochade 

00:03:12.489 --> 00:03:14.760
 being the tower in the the line 

00:03:14.760 --> 00:03:16.050
 certainly good 

00:03:16.050 --> 00:03:21.470
 not least with the lady of the back and that's why right after Elise 7 off 

00:03:21.470 --> 00:03:22.809
 that the line out 

00:03:22.809 --> 00:03:27.330
 the royal to b 1 where it is certainly better too 

00:03:27.330 --> 00:03:30.330
 uncertain than in the field c 1 

00:03:32.269 --> 00:03:34.729
 CIS 7 Rea 7 1 6 

00:03:34.729 --> 00:03:37.379
 and then also zel 6 

00:03:37.379 --> 00:03:40.339
 to be followed on occasion 

00:03:40.339 --> 00:03:42.239
 Springer Ornament 1 

00:03:42.239 --> 00:03:45.239
 the jumper strives exaggerated 3 

00:03:47.079 --> 00:03:50.239
 after a 5 

00:03:50.239 --> 00:03:52.509
 but now 

00:03:52.509 --> 00:03:53.409
 also the 

00:03:53.409 --> 00:03:55.939
 long high nobility 

00:03:55.939 --> 00:04:00.159
 of quartz watches actually she was right knows she did 

00:04:00.159 --> 00:04:03.159
 Fear beside to use for the Berlin expression 

00:04:06.419 --> 00:04:07.599
 now 

00:04:07.599 --> 00:04:11.019
 Sprenger b3i 

00:04:11.019 --> 00:04:15.749
 I already said the jumper is aiming for par 5 and that's certainly a good one 

00:04:16.269 --> 00:04:18.099
 Post were 

00:04:18.099 --> 00:04:20.600
 Runs to seven looks to the finals 

00:04:20.600 --> 00:04:23.879
 Jumper c6 

00:04:23.879 --> 00:04:26.879
 but all of Persia with now the position in the center 

00:04:28.069 --> 00:04:30.659
 he'll pile on the four again 

00:04:30.659 --> 00:04:31.919
 and maybe 

00:04:31.919 --> 00:04:32.690
 c5 

00:04:32.690 --> 00:04:35.430
 c4 with attack on the tower 

00:04:35.430 --> 00:04:38.430
 he must go back to Tier-1 

00:04:40.080 --> 00:04:43.080
 and now the knight to b 6 

00:04:43.659 --> 00:04:46.799
 So here Spatz has little to fear 

00:04:47.420 --> 00:04:51.990
 what should know what Kasparov 4 is supposed to do with his runner once 

00:04:51.990 --> 00:04:55.289
 somehow bites at b 5 

00:04:55.289 --> 00:04:56.949
 a6 

00:04:56.949 --> 00:04:58.030
 on granite 

00:04:58.030 --> 00:05:01.449
 all so thought Kaspar on game I go 3 

00:05:01.449 --> 00:05:02.660
 about him 

00:05:02.660 --> 00:05:04.779
 Hardt 3 

00:05:04.779 --> 00:05:07.449
 to bring into conversation 

00:05:07.449 --> 00:05:11.629
 Even the black King Dirk prophylactically ever flee 

00:05:11.629 --> 00:05:14.229
 b 8 

00:05:14.229 --> 00:05:17.229
 the jumper comes after 8 5 

00:05:17.860 --> 00:05:20.520
 Topal often likes these runners 

00:05:20.520 --> 00:05:22.979
 get and they go 

00:05:22.979 --> 00:05:25.979
 according to § 8 

00:05:27.139 --> 00:05:30.360
 Runners stay hard 

00:05:30.360 --> 00:05:31.900
 the six depths 

00:05:31.900 --> 00:05:36.180
 all search for appropriate preparation of this push to b 5 

00:05:37.669 --> 00:05:40.759
 you can really say Topalow Fortier 

00:05:40.759 --> 00:05:42.740
 very well balanced 

00:05:42.740 --> 00:05:47.289
 he has nothing to fear from the gobies the king's position was indeed some air 

00:05:47.289 --> 00:05:48.120
 Be a League 

00:05:48.120 --> 00:05:50.749
 but what can become her own? 

00:05:50.749 --> 00:05:53.970
 and with the white game on the flanks, if you will 

00:05:53.970 --> 00:05:57.300
 the fourth jumper on 4 5 but who are out on it 

00:05:57.300 --> 00:06:00.300
 countered black at the center 

00:06:02.539 --> 00:06:05.469
 now Donat came 

00:06:05.469 --> 00:06:07.229
 chess 

00:06:07.229 --> 00:06:10.699
 the king goes to pas 7 

00:06:10.699 --> 00:06:13.490
 Tours Party 1 

00:06:13.490 --> 00:06:15.180
 of course now threatens 

00:06:15.180 --> 00:06:16.770
 how bad the 5 

00:06:16.770 --> 00:06:18.460
 and the tower attacks 

00:06:18.460 --> 00:06:19.839
 the lady 

00:06:19.839 --> 00:06:23.539
 That's why the farmer goes past the fours 

00:06:23.539 --> 00:06:25.439
 and now everyone 

00:06:25.439 --> 00:06:28.080
 attacked knight cowardly back Michel 

00:06:28.080 --> 00:06:31.199
 then, of course, Black would already have the book of action in his hand 

00:06:31.199 --> 00:06:32.070
 insofar 

00:06:32.070 --> 00:06:35.070
 goes to the night b after the 5 

00:06:35.869 --> 00:06:37.830
 took 

00:06:37.830 --> 00:06:39.400
 will be taken again 

00:06:39.400 --> 00:06:40.990
 and with that is 

00:06:40.990 --> 00:06:45.289
 the lady attacked on the other hand of course also this farmer the 5 

00:06:45.289 --> 00:06:48.960
 the marriage is now quite vulnerable and can easily become a child of the poodle 

00:06:48.960 --> 00:06:49.419
 his
