and<00:02:11.510> then<00:02:12.510> to<00:02:12.780> that<00:02:12.930> I've<00:02:13.230> got<00:02:13.260> about<00:02:13.650> 3/4<00:02:14.340> of<00:02:14.370> a

00:02:14.539 --> 00:02:14.549 
and then to that I've got about 3/4 of a

00:02:14.549 --> 00:02:18.080 
and then to that I've got about 3/4 of a
cup<00:02:14.580> of<00:02:14.819> tomatoes<00:02:16.430> cherry<00:02:17.430> tomatoes<00:02:17.879> you<00:02:18.060> can

00:02:18.080 --> 00:02:18.090 
cup of tomatoes cherry tomatoes you can

00:02:18.090 --> 00:02:21.229 
cup of tomatoes cherry tomatoes you can
chop<00:02:18.480> up<00:02:18.510> big<00:02:18.900> tomatoes<00:02:19.319> into<00:02:19.799> pieces<00:02:20.239> grape

00:02:21.229 --> 00:02:21.239 
chop up big tomatoes into pieces grape

00:02:21.239 --> 00:02:23.330

00:02:27.740 --> 00:02:27.750 
then this I would normally use Chinese

00:02:27.750 --> 00:02:31.190 
then this I would normally use Chinese
celery<00:02:28.140> but<00:02:28.940> can't<00:02:29.940> find<00:02:30.180> Chinese<00:02:30.599> celery<00:02:30.989> in

00:02:31.190 --> 00:02:31.200 
celery but can't find Chinese celery in

00:02:31.200 --> 00:02:32.630 
celery but can't find Chinese celery in
Montgomery<00:02:31.680> so<00:02:31.829> I'm<00:02:31.920> actually<00:02:32.010> using<00:02:32.549> the

00:02:32.630 --> 00:02:32.640 
Montgomery so I'm actually using the

00:02:32.640 --> 00:02:36.559 
Montgomery so I'm actually using the
inside<00:02:33.269> stalks<00:02:33.780> of<00:02:34.280> a<00:02:35.280> regular<00:02:35.879> celery<00:02:36.120> where

00:02:36.559 --> 00:02:36.569 
inside stalks of a regular celery where

00:02:36.569 --> 00:02:38.569 
inside stalks of a regular celery where
there's<00:02:36.750> lots<00:02:36.959> of<00:02:37.170> leaves<00:02:37.440> the<00:02:37.769> smell<00:02:38.190> and<00:02:38.489> the

00:02:38.569 --> 00:02:38.579 
there's lots of leaves the smell and the

00:02:38.579 --> 00:02:41.000 
there's lots of leaves the smell and the
fragrance<00:02:38.970> is<00:02:39.090> very<00:02:39.360> similar<00:02:39.750> and<00:02:40.170> then<00:02:40.799> the

00:02:41.000 --> 00:02:41.010 
fragrance is very similar and then the

00:02:41.010 --> 00:02:43.280 
fragrance is very similar and then the
inside<00:02:41.310> stalks<00:02:41.610> are<00:02:41.790> also<00:02:41.879> a<00:02:42.030> thinner<00:02:42.360> similar

00:02:43.280 --> 00:02:43.290 
inside stalks are also a thinner similar

00:02:43.290 --> 00:02:45.050 
inside stalks are also a thinner similar
to<00:02:43.440> a<00:02:43.470> Chinese<00:02:43.950> celery<00:02:44.310> so<00:02:44.579> about<00:02:44.670> a<00:02:44.730> cup<00:02:45.000> of

00:02:45.050 --> 00:02:45.060 
to a Chinese celery so about a cup of

00:02:45.060 --> 00:02:49.309 
to a Chinese celery so about a cup of
that<00:02:45.480> in<00:02:46.230> that<00:02:46.620> goes<00:02:46.980> and<00:02:47.480> then<00:02:48.480> finally<00:02:49.109> our

00:02:49.309 --> 00:02:49.319 
that in that goes and then finally our

00:02:49.319 --> 00:02:51.500 
that in that goes and then finally our
herbs<00:02:49.709> I've<00:02:50.040> got<00:02:50.310> some<00:02:50.519> cilantro<00:02:50.910> and<00:02:51.209> green

herbs I've got some cilantro and green
onions<00:02:52.019> rough<00:02:52.410> chopped<00:02:52.769> but<00:02:53.010> a<00:02:53.040> couple

00:02:53.390 --> 00:02:53.400 
onions rough chopped but a couple

00:02:53.400 --> 00:02:57.500 
onions rough chopped but a couple
tablespoons<00:02:53.760> of<00:02:54.180> each<00:02:54.480> in<00:02:55.159> that<00:02:56.159> goes<00:02:56.510> and

00:02:57.500 --> 00:02:57.510 
tablespoons of each in that goes and

00:02:57.510 --> 00:03:01.539 
tablespoons of each in that goes and
then<00:02:58.310> just<00:02:59.310> going<00:02:59.459> to<00:02:59.549> mix<00:02:59.730> it<00:02:59.879> up<00:03:00.030> briefly

00:03:01.539 --> 00:03:01.549 
then just going to mix it up briefly

00:03:01.549 --> 00:03:06.759 
then just going to mix it up briefly
make<00:03:02.549> sure<00:03:02.730> you<00:03:02.849> break<00:03:03.060> up<00:03:03.269> the<00:03:03.420> onion<00:03:03.840> so<00:03:04.230> that

00:03:06.759 --> 00:03:06.769 

00:03:06.769 --> 00:03:10.270 

the<00:03:07.769> onions<00:03:08.099> are<00:03:08.250> not<00:03:08.370> sticking<00:03:08.940> together

00:03:10.270 --> 00:03:10.280 
the onions are not sticking together

00:03:10.280 --> 00:03:13.130 
the onions are not sticking together
okay<00:03:11.280> and<00:03:11.519> then<00:03:12.000> we're<00:03:12.420> going<00:03:12.569> to<00:03:12.659> go<00:03:12.780> and<00:03:12.959> cut

00:03:13.130 --> 00:03:13.140 
okay and then we're going to go and cut

00:03:13.140 --> 00:03:15.650 
okay and then we're going to go and cut
the<00:03:13.290> beef<00:03:13.440> now<00:03:13.709> the<00:03:14.700> beef<00:03:15.000> has<00:03:15.150> been<00:03:15.359> resting

00:03:15.650 --> 00:03:15.660 
the beef now the beef has been resting

00:03:15.660 --> 00:03:17.390 
the beef now the beef has been resting
now<00:03:15.989> I<00:03:16.019> pulled<00:03:16.319> this<00:03:16.470> off<00:03:16.680> of<00:03:16.859> the<00:03:16.950> grill<00:03:17.160> as

00:03:17.390 --> 00:03:17.400 
now I pulled this off of the grill as

00:03:17.400 --> 00:03:21.860 
now I pulled this off of the grill as
you<00:03:17.549> saw<00:03:17.730> in<00:03:17.880> part<00:03:18.060> 1<00:03:18.389> the<00:03:18.630> beef<00:03:20.419> needs<00:03:21.419> to<00:03:21.599> rest

00:03:21.860 --> 00:03:21.870 
you saw in part 1 the beef needs to rest

00:03:21.870 --> 00:03:23.690 
you saw in part 1 the beef needs to rest
for<00:03:21.989> at<00:03:22.169> least<00:03:22.380> about<00:03:22.829> five<00:03:23.040> to<00:03:23.220> ten<00:03:23.400> minutes

00:03:23.690 --> 00:03:23.700 
for at least about five to ten minutes

00:03:23.700 --> 00:03:25.940 
for at least about five to ten minutes
until<00:03:23.790> it's<00:03:24.090> not<00:03:24.180> hot<00:03:24.419> anymore<00:03:24.739> and<00:03:25.739> that's

00:03:25.940 --> 00:03:25.950 
until it's not hot anymore and that's

00:03:25.950 --> 00:03:28.789 
until it's not hot anymore and that's
because<00:03:26.160> if<00:03:27.060> you<00:03:27.810> cut<00:03:28.049> it<00:03:28.169> when<00:03:28.349> it's<00:03:28.530> fresh

00:03:28.789 --> 00:03:28.799 
because if you cut it when it's fresh

00:03:28.799 --> 00:03:30.800 
because if you cut it when it's fresh
off<00:03:29.010> the<00:03:29.220> grill<00:03:29.459> when<00:03:29.669> it's<00:03:29.790> still<00:03:29.970> hot<00:03:30.030> all

00:03:30.800 --> 00:03:30.810 
off the grill when it's still hot all

00:03:30.810 --> 00:03:32.300 
off the grill when it's still hot all
the<00:03:31.410> juice<00:03:31.680> and<00:03:31.889> everything<00:03:31.980> will<00:03:32.280> be

00:03:32.300 --> 00:03:32.310 
the juice and everything will be

00:03:32.310 --> 00:03:34.520 
the juice and everything will be
squeezed<00:03:32.879> out<00:03:33.180> and<00:03:33.480> it<00:03:33.599> needs<00:03:33.810> to<00:03:33.930> rest<00:03:34.290> so<00:03:34.440> the

00:03:34.520 --> 00:03:34.530 
squeezed out and it needs to rest so the

00:03:34.530 --> 00:03:36.619 
squeezed out and it needs to rest so the
muscles<00:03:34.889> are<00:03:34.980> relaxed<00:03:35.669> so<00:03:36.180> they're<00:03:36.419> not

00:03:36.619 --> 00:03:36.629 
muscles are relaxed so they're not

00:03:36.629 --> 00:03:38.599 
muscles are relaxed so they're not
anymore<00:03:36.959> squeezing<00:03:37.739> out<00:03:37.859> the<00:03:37.889> juice<00:03:38.280> into<00:03:38.489> the

00:03:38.599 --> 00:03:38.609 
anymore squeezing out the juice into the

00:03:38.609 --> 00:03:41.720 
anymore squeezing out the juice into the
juice<00:03:38.940> will<00:03:39.120> stay<00:03:39.329> in<00:03:39.569> side<00:03:40.500> the<00:03:40.739> me<00:03:40.919> now<00:03:41.489> when

00:03:41.720 --> 00:03:41.730 
juice will stay in side the me now when

00:03:41.730 --> 00:03:43.369 
juice will stay in side the me now when
you<00:03:41.819> cut<00:03:42.090> the<00:03:42.269> beef<00:03:42.419> depending<00:03:42.870> on<00:03:42.959> what<00:03:43.199> you

00:03:43.369 --> 00:03:43.379 
you cut the beef depending on what you

00:03:43.379 --> 00:03:45.800 
you cut the beef depending on what you
choose<00:03:43.410> it's<00:03:44.040> very<00:03:44.280> important<00:03:44.940> what

00:03:45.800 --> 00:03:45.810 
choose it's very important what

00:03:45.810 --> 00:03:48.020 
choose it's very important what
direction<00:03:46.230> you<00:03:46.560> cut<00:03:46.799> I'm<00:03:47.160> using<00:03:47.459> a<00:03:47.669> flank

00:03:48.020 --> 00:03:48.030 
direction you cut I'm using a flank

00:03:48.030 --> 00:03:50.629 
direction you cut I'm using a flank
steak<00:03:48.709> you<00:03:49.709> have<00:03:49.739> to<00:03:50.040> look<00:03:50.220> at<00:03:50.430> which

00:03:50.629 --> 00:03:50.639 
steak you have to look at which

00:03:50.639 --> 00:03:52.460 
steak you have to look at which
direction<00:03:51.060> the<00:03:51.419> grains<00:03:51.690> are<00:03:51.959> running<00:03:52.290> this

00:03:52.460 --> 00:03:52.470 
direction the grains are running this

00:03:52.470 --> 00:03:55.069 
direction the grains are running this
one<00:03:52.709> it's<00:03:52.949> running<00:03:53.280> long<00:03:53.579> ways<00:03:53.819> not<00:03:54.599> always

00:03:55.069 --> 00:03:55.079 
one it's running long ways not always

00:03:55.079 --> 00:03:57.080 
one it's running long ways not always
the<00:03:55.260> case<00:03:55.290> sometimes<00:03:55.919> a<00:03:56.040> skirt<00:03:56.430> steak<00:03:56.730> above

00:03:57.080 --> 00:03:57.090 
the case sometimes a skirt steak above

00:03:57.090 --> 00:03:59.780 
the case sometimes a skirt steak above
that<00:03:57.239> steak<00:03:57.680> the<00:03:58.680> grains<00:03:58.949> will<00:03:59.190> actually<00:03:59.519> run

00:03:59.780 --> 00:03:59.790 
that steak the grains will actually run

00:03:59.790 --> 00:04:01.909 
that steak the grains will actually run
this<00:04:00.120> way<00:04:00.419> in<00:04:00.690> which<00:04:00.840> case<00:04:01.079> you<00:04:01.440> will<00:04:01.530> have<00:04:01.590> to

00:04:01.909 --> 00:04:01.919 
this way in which case you will have to

00:04:01.919 --> 00:04:04.610 
this way in which case you will have to
turn<00:04:02.190> the<00:04:02.430> steak<00:04:02.669> and<00:04:02.699> cut<00:04:03.169> against<00:04:04.169> the<00:04:04.260> grain

00:04:04.610 --> 00:04:04.620 
turn the steak and cut against the grain

00:04:04.620 --> 00:04:06.740 
turn the steak and cut against the grain
because<00:04:05.099> otherwise<00:04:05.609> the<00:04:06.180> muscle<00:04:06.510> fiber

00:04:06.740 --> 00:04:06.750 
because otherwise the muscle fiber

00:04:06.750 --> 00:04:08.809 
because otherwise the muscle fiber
fibers<00:04:07.560> will<00:04:07.709> be<00:04:07.829> really<00:04:08.069> long<00:04:08.370> and<00:04:08.609> it'll<00:04:08.760> be

00:04:08.809 --> 00:04:08.819 
fibers will be really long and it'll be

00:04:08.819 --> 00:04:15.800 
fibers will be really long and it'll be
really<00:04:08.940> chewy<00:04:09.419> okay<00:04:10.260> so<00:04:10.319> very<00:04:10.769> thinly<00:04:14.810> okay

00:04:15.800 --> 00:04:15.810 
really chewy okay so very thinly okay
