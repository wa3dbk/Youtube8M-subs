00:00:02.230 --> 00:00:08.780
 on the highest mountains in the world there 

00:00:07.100 --> 00:00:16.550
 are roads on which only the best 

00:00:08.780 --> 00:00:18.800
 the chances of being survive 

00:00:16.550 --> 00:00:20.600
 killed here are very tall is one 

00:00:18.800 --> 00:00:24.939
 completely new challenge for the heroes 

00:00:20.600 --> 00:00:26.960
 of the ice in which only hunted 

00:00:24.939 --> 00:00:29.470
 they will face the most dangerous roads 

00:00:26.960 --> 00:00:29.470
 of the world 

00:00:30.160 --> 00:00:34.060
 to prove that there is no route to it 

00:00:32.890 --> 00:00:36.430
 can conquer 

00:00:34.060 --> 00:00:38.470
 I came here to try something on 

00:00:36.430 --> 00:00:40.450
 whichever way you put me I will succeed 

00:00:38.470 --> 00:00:42.640
 to complete my task and not 

00:00:40.450 --> 00:00:45.489
 there is a load they cannot carry 

00:00:42.640 --> 00:00:47.230
 my goal is simple i wanted 

00:00:45.489 --> 00:00:49.870
 try this way because everyone 

00:00:47.230 --> 00:00:52.570
 they say that it will be difficult for this and 

00:00:49.870 --> 00:00:54.489
 in fact these roads are frightening 

00:00:52.570 --> 00:00:57.400
 cause one victim every 4 minutes e 

00:00:54.489 --> 00:01:01.140
 half is one of our heroes will not succeed 

00:00:57.400 --> 00:01:01.140
 to complete even the first trip 

00:01:06.240 --> 00:01:12.500
 the toughest truck drivers face the 

00:01:08.970 --> 00:01:12.500
 most difficult roads in the world 

00:01:24.750 --> 00:01:29.220
 I have great respect for this road 

00:01:29.430 --> 00:01:33.720
 here it can happen to you all 

00:01:34.510 --> 00:01:40.770
 nothing guard rail just an overhang in 

00:01:37.180 --> 00:01:43.219
 a good part is a single lane 

00:01:40.770 --> 00:01:45.509
 make the braggart pay the pay dear 

00:01:43.219 --> 00:01:48.840
 these trade routes come 

00:01:45.509 --> 00:01:50.610
 used for millennia but the journey does not 

00:01:48.840 --> 00:01:53.729
 it has never been more dangerous 

00:01:50.610 --> 00:01:57.689
 last year over 180,000 people are 

00:01:53.729 --> 00:02:02.490
 everything died on the roads of India 

00:01:57.689 --> 00:02:04.110
 here is pure chaos now alex ricche lisa 

00:02:02.490 --> 00:02:06.750
 have signed a contract for 

00:02:04.110 --> 00:02:08.220
 carry 150 tons of materials 

00:02:06.750 --> 00:02:10.500
 to supply a giant plant 

00:02:08.220 --> 00:02:13.280
 hydroelectric located in the middle of the 

00:02:10.500 --> 00:02:16.290
 Asian continent in northern India 

00:02:13.280 --> 00:02:19.319
 from the city ​​of Shimla they go up the 

00:02:16.290 --> 00:02:22.110
 first or freeway his crazy health the 

00:02:19.319 --> 00:02:25.170
 heart blows its blind twists 

00:02:22.110 --> 00:02:26.430
 and the infrastructures that threaten the vine 

00:02:25.170 --> 00:02:27.840
 which he kept together with the two supporting beams 

00:02:26.430 --> 00:02:29.640
 there is no more 

00:02:27.840 --> 00:02:32.579
 through a section dug into the 

00:02:29.640 --> 00:02:34.349
 living rock called clipping there is a 

00:02:32.579 --> 00:02:36.120
 huge crack right there all this 

00:02:34.349 --> 00:02:38.579
 part could collapse take away the 

00:02:36.120 --> 00:02:41.549
 street is a difficult road called 

00:02:38.579 --> 00:02:43.360
 the ledge and I'm regretting having 

00:02:41.549 --> 00:02:45.760
 accepted the job 

00:02:43.360 --> 00:02:48.730
 if they survive they will push themselves again 

00:02:45.760 --> 00:02:51.540
 deeper in the Himalaya from manali 

00:02:48.730 --> 00:02:56.020
 they will climb and 4000 meters of the rota step 

00:02:51.540 --> 00:02:57.780
 facing the landslides was down from 

00:02:56.020 --> 00:03:00.130
 slope and throw us straight into the river 

00:02:57.780 --> 00:03:02.800
 rocks the movement are falling 

00:03:00.130 --> 00:03:05.140
 right now it's an endless series of 

00:03:02.800 --> 00:03:06.850
 hairpin bends to deliver supplies 

00:03:05.140 --> 00:03:08.910
 essential to an isolated city 

00:03:06.850 --> 00:03:12.280
 for the whole winter 

00:03:08.910 --> 00:03:16.000
 I'm terrified 

00:03:12.280 --> 00:03:18.940
 our heroes will risk everything is dead 

00:03:16.000 --> 00:03:21.340
 exact on completely different media from 

00:03:18.940 --> 00:03:24.100
 those who know if you have an accident 

00:03:21.340 --> 00:03:26.020
 here there is now no protection in the north 

00:03:24.100 --> 00:03:27.310
 America to trucks have a 

00:03:26.020 --> 00:03:31.780
 steel structure that protects 

00:03:27.310 --> 00:03:34.120
 the cabin in accidents the nanny 16 

00:03:31.780 --> 00:03:38.470
 13 and made only by motor wheels and a 

00:03:34.120 --> 00:03:41.310
 wooden frame after a collision is 

00:03:38.470 --> 00:03:43.110
 hard for anything to remain 

00:03:41.310 --> 00:03:45.480
 it's like driving a matchbox 

00:03:43.110 --> 00:03:48.720
 with the wheels a shot and pieces of 

00:03:45.480 --> 00:03:50.340
 wood from all sides three truck drivers e 

00:03:48.720 --> 00:03:53.340
 I want to go back to the d'altrone more 

00:03:50.340 --> 00:03:58.790
 easy two months the only one is stronger 

00:03:53.340 --> 00:03:58.790
 they survive a race on top of the world
