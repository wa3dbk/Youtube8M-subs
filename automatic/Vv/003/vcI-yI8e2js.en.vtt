00:01:30.719 --> 00:01:30.729 
would even reach for me in class but I

00:01:30.729 --> 00:01:32.010 
would even reach for me in class but I
was<00:01:30.940> like<00:01:31.060> okay<00:01:31.150> I'll<00:01:31.450> just<00:01:31.660> deal<00:01:31.810> with<00:01:31.869> it

00:01:32.010 --> 00:01:32.020

00:01:39.000 --> 00:01:39.010 
whatever and now it's broke so I would

00:01:39.010 --> 00:01:44.810 
whatever and now it's broke so I would
say<00:01:39.280> my<00:01:39.670> initial<00:01:42.060> thoughts<00:01:43.060> about<00:01:43.780> SOG<00:01:44.229> stuff

00:01:44.810 --> 00:01:44.820

say my initial thoughts about SOG stuff
I'm<00:01:45.820> sticking<00:01:46.360> to<00:01:46.390> it<00:01:46.600> it<00:01:47.110> is<00:01:47.530> my<00:01:47.890> first<00:01:48.160> one<00:01:48.550> I

00:01:48.570 --> 00:01:48.580 
I'm sticking to it it is my first one I

00:01:48.580 --> 00:01:50.100 
I'm sticking to it it is my first one I
know<00:01:48.880> there's<00:01:49.150> a<00:01:49.210> lot<00:01:49.330> of<00:01:49.450> hype<00:01:49.600> behind<00:01:49.780> them

00:01:50.100 --> 00:01:50.110 
know there's a lot of hype behind them

00:01:50.110 --> 00:01:56.040 
know there's a lot of hype behind them
right<00:01:50.140> now<00:01:53.369> don't<00:01:54.369> care<00:01:54.670> for<00:01:54.850> them<00:01:55.030> seeing<00:01:55.810> how

00:01:56.040 --> 00:01:56.050 
right now don't care for them seeing how

00:01:56.050 --> 00:02:02.010 
right now don't care for them seeing how
it<00:01:56.770> even<00:01:57.250> says<00:01:57.550> it's<00:01:58.030> a<00:02:00.450> threat<00:02:01.450> you<00:02:01.570> know<00:02:01.720> it's

00:02:02.010 --> 00:02:02.020 
it even says it's a threat you know it's

00:02:02.020 --> 00:02:07.910 
it even says it's a threat you know it's
it<00:02:02.200> could<00:02:02.380> be<00:02:02.530> used<00:02:02.740> as<00:02:02.890> throwing<00:02:03.250> item<00:02:06.509> so

00:02:07.910 --> 00:02:07.920 
it could be used as throwing item so

00:02:07.920 --> 00:02:10.940 
it could be used as throwing item so
what<00:02:08.920> I'm<00:02:09.039> going<00:02:09.399> to<00:02:09.429> do<00:02:09.819> is<00:02:10.090> that<00:02:10.330> because

00:02:10.940 --> 00:02:10.950 
what I'm going to do is that because

00:02:10.950 --> 00:02:15.750 
what I'm going to do is that because
this<00:02:11.950> is<00:02:12.010> self<00:02:12.580> it<00:02:12.850> still<00:02:14.160> appears<00:02:15.160> to<00:02:15.250> be<00:02:15.340> okay

00:02:15.750 --> 00:02:15.760 
this is self it still appears to be okay

00:02:15.760 --> 00:02:17.640 
this is self it still appears to be okay
I'm<00:02:16.600> still<00:02:16.840> going<00:02:17.020> to<00:02:17.110> attach<00:02:17.290> this<00:02:17.440> to<00:02:17.500> a

00:02:17.640 --> 00:02:17.650 
I'm still going to attach this to a

00:02:17.650 --> 00:02:21.090 
I'm still going to attach this to a
broom<00:02:17.950> handle<00:02:18.190> and<00:02:18.670> chuck<00:02:19.569> it<00:02:19.750> and<00:02:19.930> see<00:02:20.710> what

00:02:21.090 --> 00:02:21.100 
broom handle and chuck it and see what

00:02:21.100 --> 00:02:24.210 
broom handle and chuck it and see what
happens<00:02:21.490> there<00:02:21.790> but<00:02:22.319> the<00:02:23.319> handle<00:02:23.680> itself<00:02:23.950> is

00:02:24.210 --> 00:02:24.220 
happens there but the handle itself is

00:02:24.220 --> 00:02:30.360 
happens there but the handle itself is
gone<00:02:24.870> kaput<00:02:25.870> done<00:02:27.450> finished<00:02:29.040> so<00:02:30.040> I<00:02:30.069> probably

00:02:30.360 --> 00:02:30.370 
gone kaput done finished so I probably

00:02:30.370 --> 00:02:31.860 
gone kaput done finished so I probably
will<00:02:30.700> be<00:02:30.760> checking<00:02:31.060> out<00:02:31.240> how<00:02:31.390> to<00:02:31.450> do<00:02:31.660> that

00:02:31.860 --> 00:02:31.870 
will be checking out how to do that

00:02:31.870 --> 00:02:33.960 
will be checking out how to do that
whole<00:02:32.080> lifetime<00:02:32.830> guarantee<00:02:33.310> see<00:02:33.550> that's<00:02:33.760> even

00:02:33.960 --> 00:02:33.970 
whole lifetime guarantee see that's even

00:02:33.970 --> 00:02:36.990 
whole lifetime guarantee see that's even
covered<00:02:34.390> or<00:02:34.569> I'll<00:02:34.870> just<00:02:35.250> epoxy<00:02:36.250> it<00:02:36.340> fix<00:02:36.670> it<00:02:36.880> and
