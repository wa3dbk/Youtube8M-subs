00:00:20.540 --> 00:00:20.550 
to see some world-class runners who

00:00:20.550 --> 00:00:23.269 
to see some world-class runners who
could<00:00:21.480> possibly<00:00:22.260> improve<00:00:22.439> on<00:00:22.830> their<00:00:22.949> form<00:00:23.160> a

00:00:23.269 --> 00:00:23.279 
could possibly improve on their form a

00:00:23.279 --> 00:00:25.730 
could possibly improve on their form a
little<00:00:23.430> bit<00:00:24.109> one<00:00:25.109> of<00:00:25.140> the<00:00:25.199> things<00:00:25.380> I'll<00:00:25.560> point

00:00:25.730 --> 00:00:25.740 
little bit one of the things I'll point

00:00:25.740 --> 00:00:27.170 
little bit one of the things I'll point
out<00:00:25.949> first<00:00:26.250> as<00:00:26.490> rad<00:00:26.670> as<00:00:26.760> they<00:00:26.849> come<00:00:27.000> off<00:00:27.029> the

mile pace you can see how relaxed the

00:00:31.830 --> 00:00:37.580 
mile pace you can see how relaxed the
Kenyans<00:00:32.219> are<00:00:32.399> especially<00:00:35.600> no<00:00:36.600> wasted<00:00:37.110> and<00:00:37.290> no

00:00:40.850 --> 00:00:40.860 
wasted movements from the front you can

00:00:40.860 --> 00:00:42.319 
wasted movements from the front you can
see<00:00:41.070> how<00:00:41.280> their<00:00:41.460> arms<00:00:41.790> stay<00:00:42.059> on<00:00:42.149> their<00:00:42.300> own

00:00:42.319 --> 00:00:42.329 
see how their arms stay on their own

00:00:42.329 --> 00:00:43.970 
see how their arms stay on their own
side<00:00:42.450> of<00:00:43.260> their<00:00:43.379> bodies

00:00:43.970 --> 00:00:43.980 
side of their bodies

00:00:43.980 --> 00:00:45.860 
side of their bodies
you're<00:00:44.730> not<00:00:44.879> robotic<00:00:45.420> but<00:00:45.600> they're<00:00:45.750> really

00:00:45.860 --> 00:00:45.870 
you're not robotic but they're really

00:00:45.870 --> 00:00:47.650 
you're not robotic but they're really
relaxed<00:00:46.410> and<00:00:46.530> they<00:00:46.590> stay<00:00:46.800> on<00:00:46.829> their<00:00:46.980> own<00:00:47.129> sides

00:00:47.650 --> 00:00:47.660 
relaxed and they stay on their own sides

relaxed and they stay on their own sides
you<00:00:48.660> can<00:00:48.750> also<00:00:48.930> see<00:00:49.280> how<00:00:50.280> level<00:00:50.730> their<00:00:50.910> heads

00:00:51.110 --> 00:00:51.120 
you can also see how level their heads

00:00:51.120 --> 00:00:52.639 
you can also see how level their heads
are<00:00:51.329> not<00:00:51.600> a<00:00:51.629> whole<00:00:51.840> lot<00:00:51.989> up<00:00:52.110> and<00:00:52.289> down<00:00:52.410> motion

00:00:52.639 --> 00:00:52.649 
are not a whole lot up and down motion

00:00:52.649 --> 00:00:54.770 
are not a whole lot up and down motion
whereas<00:00:53.460> in<00:00:53.879> the<00:00:53.969> back<00:00:54.180> you<00:00:54.390> can<00:00:54.449> see<00:00:54.510> I'm

00:00:54.770 --> 00:00:54.780 
whereas in the back you can see I'm

00:00:54.780 --> 00:00:57.080 
whereas in the back you can see I'm
moving<00:00:55.079> my<00:00:55.230> head<00:00:55.410> around<00:00:55.879> some<00:00:56.879> of<00:00:56.910> the<00:00:57.059> other

00:00:57.080 --> 00:00:57.090 
moving my head around some of the other

00:00:57.090 --> 00:01:00.020 
moving my head around some of the other
guys<00:00:57.329> are<00:00:57.539> bouncing<00:00:57.870> up<00:00:57.960> and<00:00:58.079> down<00:00:58.910> from<00:00:59.910> the

00:01:00.020 --> 00:01:00.030 
guys are bouncing up and down from the

00:01:00.030 --> 00:01:05.030 
guys are bouncing up and down from the
side<00:01:00.239> we<00:01:00.510> can<00:01:00.539> see<00:01:00.899> the<00:01:01.140> lean<00:01:03.650> pretty<00:01:04.650> much<00:01:04.890> the

00:01:05.030 --> 00:01:05.040 
side we can see the lean pretty much the

00:01:05.040 --> 00:01:06.980 
side we can see the lean pretty much the
whole<00:01:05.159> pack<00:01:05.430> illustrates<00:01:06.060> it<00:01:06.150> very<00:01:06.330> well<00:01:06.510> you

00:01:06.980 --> 00:01:06.990 
whole pack illustrates it very well you

00:01:06.990 --> 00:01:08.600 
whole pack illustrates it very well you
can<00:01:07.049> see<00:01:07.320> especially<00:01:07.530> how<00:01:07.979> the<00:01:08.040> Kenyans<00:01:08.490> are

00:01:08.600 --> 00:01:08.610 
can see especially how the Kenyans are

00:01:08.610 --> 00:01:10.760 
can see especially how the Kenyans are
able<00:01:08.820> to<00:01:08.850> keep<00:01:09.000> their<00:01:09.210> weight<00:01:09.390> forward<00:01:09.960> and

00:01:10.760 --> 00:01:10.770 
able to keep their weight forward and

00:01:10.770 --> 00:01:13.789 
able to keep their weight forward and
perfect<00:01:11.340> sync<00:01:11.700> with<00:01:11.939> their<00:01:12.090> stride<00:01:12.799> very

00:01:13.789 --> 00:01:13.799 
perfect sync with their stride very

00:01:13.799 --> 00:01:17.510 
perfect sync with their stride very
relaxed<00:01:14.430> I<00:01:15.770> just<00:01:16.770> slowed<00:01:16.920> it<00:01:17.040> down<00:01:17.070> a<00:01:17.220> little

00:01:17.510 --> 00:01:17.520 
relaxed I just slowed it down a little

00:01:17.520 --> 00:01:19.550 
relaxed I just slowed it down a little
bit<00:01:17.640> we<00:01:17.790> can<00:01:17.939> see<00:01:18.180> a<00:01:18.450> couple<00:01:19.049> things<00:01:19.380> we<00:01:19.530> can

00:01:19.550 --> 00:01:19.560 
bit we can see a couple things we can

00:01:19.560 --> 00:01:21.950 
bit we can see a couple things we can
see<00:01:19.799> how<00:01:20.040> both<00:01:20.790> canyons<00:01:21.299> are<00:01:21.390> landing<00:01:21.689> right

00:01:21.950 --> 00:01:21.960 
see how both canyons are landing right

00:01:21.960 --> 00:01:23.630 
see how both canyons are landing right
underneath<00:01:22.290> themselves<00:01:22.890> right<00:01:23.159> on<00:01:23.340> their<00:01:23.460> mid

00:01:23.630 --> 00:01:23.640 
underneath themselves right on their mid

00:01:23.640 --> 00:01:26.300 
underneath themselves right on their mid
foot<00:01:24.110> not<00:01:25.110> reaching<00:01:25.530> out<00:01:25.650> striking<00:01:26.159> heel

00:01:26.300 --> 00:01:26.310 
foot not reaching out striking heel

00:01:26.310 --> 00:01:28.429 
foot not reaching out striking heel
first<00:01:26.580> they<00:01:26.909> pull<00:01:27.119> that<00:01:27.150> foot<00:01:27.450> through<00:01:27.659> you

00:01:28.429 --> 00:01:28.439 
first they pull that foot through you

00:01:28.439 --> 00:01:29.780 
first they pull that foot through you
know<00:01:28.590> so<00:01:28.799> we're<00:01:29.009> gonna<00:01:29.100> take<00:01:29.340> a<00:01:29.400> look<00:01:29.549> at<00:01:29.700> the

00:01:29.780 --> 00:01:29.790 
know so we're gonna take a look at the

00:01:29.790 --> 00:01:32.780 
know so we're gonna take a look at the
guy<00:01:29.909> in<00:01:29.939> the<00:01:30.180> orange<00:01:30.950> it<00:01:31.950> was<00:01:32.130> obviously

00:01:32.780 --> 00:01:32.790 
guy in the orange it was obviously

00:01:32.790 --> 00:01:34.520 
guy in the orange it was obviously
working<00:01:32.970> a<00:01:33.119> little<00:01:33.210> bit<00:01:33.360> harder<00:01:33.420> his<00:01:34.049> arms<00:01:34.409> are

00:01:34.520 --> 00:01:34.530 
working a little bit harder his arms are

00:01:34.530 --> 00:01:37.100 
working a little bit harder his arms are
going<00:01:34.650> every<00:01:35.040> which<00:01:35.159> way<00:01:35.720> yeah<00:01:36.720> he's<00:01:36.900> one<00:01:37.079> of

00:01:37.100 --> 00:01:37.110 
going every which way yeah he's one of

00:01:37.110 --> 00:01:39.260 
going every which way yeah he's one of
the<00:01:37.229> best<00:01:37.380> runners<00:01:37.710> in<00:01:37.829> the<00:01:37.920> world<00:01:37.950> in<00:01:38.490> spite

00:01:39.260 --> 00:01:39.270 
the best runners in the world in spite

00:01:39.270 --> 00:01:45.740 
the best runners in the world in spite
of<00:01:39.299> his<00:01:39.689> inefficiencies<00:01:44.210> so<00:01:45.210> even<00:01:45.450> the<00:01:45.540> best

00:01:45.740 --> 00:01:45.750 
of his inefficiencies so even the best

00:01:45.750 --> 00:01:48.590 
of his inefficiencies so even the best
runners<00:01:46.229> have<00:01:46.560> have<00:01:46.950> room<00:01:47.189> to<00:01:47.340> improve<00:01:47.729> and<00:01:48.119> we

00:01:48.590 --> 00:01:48.600 
runners have have room to improve and we

00:01:48.600 --> 00:01:49.819 
runners have have room to improve and we
can<00:01:48.720> see<00:01:48.869> that<00:01:48.930> again<00:01:49.200> as<00:01:49.350> they<00:01:49.470> come<00:01:49.649> off<00:01:49.770> the

00:01:49.819 --> 00:01:49.829 
can see that again as they come off the

00:01:49.829 --> 00:01:52.280 
can see that again as they come off the
last<00:01:50.070> turn<00:01:50.399> the<00:01:51.240> British<00:01:51.570> guy<00:01:51.750> in<00:01:51.990> the<00:01:52.110> white
