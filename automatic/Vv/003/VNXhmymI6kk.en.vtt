00:00:06.379 --> 00:00:11.730
 hello here is giga channel on the 

00:00:08.849 --> 00:00:14.459
 mwc 2010 we are in the bude 

00:00:11.730 --> 00:00:16.500
 from asus where we now the asus 

00:00:14.459 --> 00:00:18.600
 sen of 2 was presented 

00:00:16.500 --> 00:00:20.760
 that officially already on the ces of this 

00:00:18.600 --> 00:00:21.780
 year in las vegas but now we have 

00:00:20.760 --> 00:00:22.770
 sometimes the possibility and a 

00:00:21.780 --> 00:00:24.570
 a little bit at peace with the 

00:00:22.770 --> 00:00:26.490
 to argue and that's why 

00:00:24.570 --> 00:00:29.460
 ye also watch the time now 

00:00:26.490 --> 00:00:31.230
 here in my hand is the die 

00:00:29.460 --> 00:00:33.660
 I would like something of a high quality version 

00:00:31.230 --> 00:00:36.180
 Let's say there is one in each case 

00:00:33.660 --> 00:00:37.320
 version with a hd display and a 

00:00:36.180 --> 00:00:40.710
 with a full hd display 

00:00:37.320 --> 00:00:41.460
 So here is the full hd version first 

00:00:40.710 --> 00:00:43.770
 maybe a little bit to that 

00:00:41.460 --> 00:00:46.130
 externality of the device that has one 

00:00:43.770 --> 00:00:50.280
 55 inch big beats mentioned 

00:00:46.130 --> 00:00:53.190
 full hd display up here I think so 

00:00:50.280 --> 00:00:56.190
 always not so cheap the power 

00:00:53.190 --> 00:00:59.160
 button and next to the connection for the 

00:00:56.190 --> 00:01:01.649
 headphones on the left is here 

00:00:59.160 --> 00:01:04.079
 absolutely nothing and the same is synonymous 

00:01:01.649 --> 00:01:06.719
 so on the other side are down here 

00:01:04.079 --> 00:01:08.460
 we have such a small possibility to get to that 

00:01:06.719 --> 00:01:09.540
 cover back purely to happen but 

00:01:08.460 --> 00:01:12.060
 later a bit more 

00:01:09.540 --> 00:01:14.670
 and here below only at connections 

00:01:12.060 --> 00:01:16.140
 the one for the micro usb cable 

00:01:14.670 --> 00:01:18.180
 why that with the power button though 

00:01:16.140 --> 00:01:21.450
 Not so bad because you 

00:01:18.180 --> 00:01:22.860
 The device also with double cab from the 

00:01:21.450 --> 00:01:25.229
 sleep mode 

00:01:22.860 --> 00:01:26.850
 that's a nice thing 

00:01:25.229 --> 00:01:28.530
 it's going to be a little bit too much 

00:01:26.850 --> 00:01:30.299
 device in different variants 

00:01:28.530 --> 00:01:31.740
 So for a different displays 

00:01:30.299 --> 00:01:32.670
 but also different 

00:01:31.740 --> 00:01:35.939
 processors 

00:01:32.670 --> 00:01:39.659
 this is done either in 64 bit intel atom z 

00:01:35.939 --> 00:01:43.310
 3 560 or in z 3 580 quad-core its the 

00:01:39.659 --> 00:01:46.400
 then either with 18 or with 2 3 ghz 

00:01:43.310 --> 00:01:46.400
 are clocked 

00:01:49.340 --> 00:01:54.810
 the battery in the sense of 2 has one 

00:01:52.289 --> 00:01:58.140
 Capacity of 3,000 milliHours 

00:01:54.810 --> 00:02:00.990
 and certainly makes it so for that 

00:01:58.140 --> 00:02:02.130
 that's how you say day by day 

00:02:00.990 --> 00:02:03.810
 Hanging , of course, also depends 

00:02:02.130 --> 00:02:05.789
 we will always use everything from us 

00:02:03.810 --> 00:02:09.629
 then in a test a little closer 

00:02:05.789 --> 00:02:12.150
 The device weighs 170 grams 

00:02:09.629 --> 00:02:13.709
 so that's what you'll say 

00:02:12.150 --> 00:02:15.870
 average weight just for 

00:02:13.709 --> 00:02:17.670
 the size i am very pleasant you 

00:02:15.870 --> 00:02:19.319
 is very comfortable the hand there 

00:02:17.670 --> 00:02:22.410
 still a very significant difference 

00:02:19.319 --> 00:02:24.690
 between the full hd and dts hd version 

00:02:22.410 --> 00:02:27.480
 in the full hd version you come this 

00:02:24.690 --> 00:02:28.140
 this brushed aluminum look to 

00:02:27.480 --> 00:02:30.959
 commitment 

00:02:28.140 --> 00:02:31.920
 and that looks really chic like him 

00:02:30.959 --> 00:02:34.470
 already mentioned earlier 

00:02:31.920 --> 00:02:36.840
 he is here at the side of this one 

00:02:34.470 --> 00:02:38.970
 small thing to reject the battery cover 

00:02:36.840 --> 00:02:41.400
 then as I said, not the 

00:02:38.970 --> 00:02:43.010
 exempt battery but this allows 

00:02:41.400 --> 00:02:45.150
 quite simply the back cover 

00:02:43.010 --> 00:02:46.440
 exchange and then others 

00:02:45.150 --> 00:02:47.849
 to use colors that means if one 

00:02:46.440 --> 00:02:49.950
 at first maybe even for the 

00:02:47.849 --> 00:02:51.780
 you have to decide golden edition 

00:02:49.950 --> 00:02:54.420
 Do not miss it, too 

00:02:51.780 --> 00:02:58.139
 to bring the white version to use 

00:02:54.420 --> 00:03:00.090
 or like the red variant and 

00:02:58.139 --> 00:03:01.650
 Besides, there is also how to get there 

00:03:00.090 --> 00:03:03.150
 behind a silver edition 

00:03:01.650 --> 00:03:05.459
 that is, who is a bit diverse 

00:03:03.150 --> 00:03:06.510
 would like to have for his device that can 

00:03:05.459 --> 00:03:08.160
 just move different 

00:03:06.510 --> 00:03:10.500
 cover get here very easily 

00:03:08.160 --> 00:03:12.600
 exchange where we already on the 

00:03:10.500 --> 00:03:14.579
 back are some people of you 

00:03:12.600 --> 00:03:16.410
 other devices also know the rear 

00:03:14.579 --> 00:03:17.910
 equipped with such a button 

00:03:16.410 --> 00:03:20.040
 usually find themselves on 

00:03:17.910 --> 00:03:21.690
 smartphones the volume we feel 

00:03:20.040 --> 00:03:22.440
 actually on the left side 

00:03:21.690 --> 00:03:24.299
 or on the right 

00:03:22.440 --> 00:03:26.130
 but in this case it is also behind 

00:03:24.299 --> 00:03:27.269
 In general, I find it appropriate 

00:03:26.130 --> 00:03:28.799
 actually very handy because if you 

00:03:27.269 --> 00:03:30.480
 you can hold the device in your hand 

00:03:28.799 --> 00:03:32.280
 easy back here if you are 

00:03:30.480 --> 00:03:33.540
 The device simply knows the device 

00:03:32.280 --> 00:03:34.709
 change the volume 

00:03:33.540 --> 00:03:36.690
 Let's stay on the scene for a while 

00:03:34.709 --> 00:03:38.760
 back up here we find of course 

00:03:36.690 --> 00:03:40.950
 a camera no smartphone comes 

00:03:38.760 --> 00:03:43.230
 nowadays without main camera from the triggers 

00:03:40.950 --> 00:03:44.400
 with 3 10 megapixels and draws 

00:03:43.230 --> 00:03:46.950
 above all things so a bit 

00:03:44.400 --> 00:03:49.680
 through her lola skills out about it 

00:03:46.950 --> 00:03:51.599
 a dual led lightning for even better 

00:03:49.680 --> 00:03:54.230
 lighting in the dark on below 

00:03:51.599 --> 00:03:56.989
 the side milled that 

00:03:54.230 --> 00:03:58.400
 the eroded speakers and 

00:03:56.989 --> 00:04:00.620
 of course there is also the front 

00:03:58.400 --> 00:04:03.080
 a camera that solves with 5 megapixels 

00:04:00.620 --> 00:04:04.400
 for all the people who make a variety 

00:04:03.080 --> 00:04:07.159
 certainly want a very 

00:04:04.400 --> 00:04:08.599
 appealing thing to the point 

00:04:07.159 --> 00:04:11.090
 interior life maybe you see 

00:04:08.599 --> 00:04:11.660
 that it is not a pure android here 

00:04:11.090 --> 00:04:14.269
 on it is 

00:04:11.660 --> 00:04:16.040
 it is known for its own 

00:04:14.269 --> 00:04:18.739
 user interface also to install 

00:04:16.040 --> 00:04:20.000
 that's called the new and it has 

00:04:18.739 --> 00:04:21.680
 a few different gadgets for 

00:04:20.000 --> 00:04:23.960
 some maybe a bit too pointy 

00:04:21.680 --> 00:04:25.490
 but that does not matter in this one 

00:04:23.960 --> 00:04:27.740
 year is the same for some devices 

00:04:25.490 --> 00:04:30.020
 pretty much in the sign of the 

00:04:27.740 --> 00:04:32.240
 individualization would be alternative 

00:04:30.020 --> 00:04:33.830
 Launcher likes to use who knows the 

00:04:32.240 --> 00:04:36.289
 possibility already on own and 

00:04:33.830 --> 00:04:38.389
 wallpaper and everything possible on the device 

00:04:36.289 --> 00:04:41.780
 to suit your own needs 

00:04:38.389 --> 00:04:43.820
 has it here in the mustard now in meaningful 

00:04:41.780 --> 00:04:45.650
 two directly into the valley directly 

00:04:43.820 --> 00:04:46.660
 integrated, come here for pack 

00:04:45.650 --> 00:04:50.120
 download 

00:04:46.660 --> 00:04:52.100
 So you can do pretty much anything about that 

00:04:50.120 --> 00:04:53.389
 So change the whole decision picture 

00:04:52.100 --> 00:04:54.650
 that it's your own taste 

00:04:53.389 --> 00:04:56.810
 maybe a little better then 

00:04:54.650 --> 00:05:00.590
 also in combination with the back 

00:04:56.810 --> 00:05:02.450
 Cover the one on the back where we have 

00:05:00.590 --> 00:05:04.310
 already at the operating system are you dream 

00:05:02.450 --> 00:05:06.710
 very briefly in the settings purely 

00:05:04.310 --> 00:05:08.690
 when I found here somewhere that 

00:05:06.710 --> 00:05:10.639
 they are not here but here 

00:05:08.690 --> 00:05:14.270
 then we can go down here 

00:05:10.639 --> 00:05:15.740
 look which operating system version 

00:05:14.270 --> 00:05:19.970
 this is how it works 

00:05:15.740 --> 00:05:21.889
 here at android 1.0 so lollipop the 

00:05:19.970 --> 00:05:22.780
 We can prove it very well here 

00:05:21.889 --> 00:05:24.979
 put 

00:05:22.780 --> 00:05:26.780
 All in all in any case 

00:05:24.979 --> 00:05:28.280
 really very fancy that happens 

00:05:26.780 --> 00:05:30.080
 all things also by an at least 

00:05:28.280 --> 00:05:32.270
 previously announced the price performance 

00:05:30.080 --> 00:05:33.560
 relationship becomes very interesting in 

00:05:32.270 --> 00:05:35.870
 america it was presented the 

00:05:33.560 --> 00:05:38.750
 cheapest variant so in hd display 

00:05:35.870 --> 00:05:40.529
 should be there in the price range of 199 

00:05:38.750 --> 00:05:41.879
 dollars are just like that 

00:05:40.529 --> 00:05:42.779
 Price and occupation to Germany 

00:05:41.879 --> 00:05:44.189
 we will be able to do that now 

00:05:42.779 --> 00:05:46.939
 not say but it certainly will 

00:05:44.189 --> 00:05:49.049
 so somewhere in the frame 

00:05:46.939 --> 00:05:50.639
 it will be somewhere in the frame 

00:05:49.049 --> 00:05:52.739
 and now not in the for the 

00:05:50.639 --> 00:05:54.509
 hd version indy 500 euro cost and clear 

00:05:52.739 --> 00:05:55.919
 if it is then with the full hd display and 

00:05:54.509 --> 00:05:57.749
 the better processor is equipped 

00:05:55.919 --> 00:05:59.699
 of course, it's more expensive, though 

00:05:57.749 --> 00:06:01.109
 generally from the price 

00:05:59.699 --> 00:06:04.199
 a very good performance ratio 

00:06:01.109 --> 00:06:05.909
 interesting device has you the video 

00:06:04.199 --> 00:06:06.179
 please give us a thumb 

00:06:05.909 --> 00:06:08.519
 high 

00:06:06.179 --> 00:06:10.319
 below you can find more videos from 

00:06:08.519 --> 00:06:11.849
 mwc and if you want to subscribe 

00:06:10.319 --> 00:06:14.239
 then you can see this on the side 

00:06:11.849 --> 00:06:14.239
 do
