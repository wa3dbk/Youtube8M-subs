00:00:00.920 --> 00:00:05.970
 Take a close look and pay attention 

00:00:03.929 --> 00:00:08.400
 in the artist colony of darmstadt 

00:00:05.970 --> 00:00:11.309
 because the museum opens its doors for 

00:00:08.400 --> 00:00:13.620
 an extraordinary exhibition echo 

00:00:11.309 --> 00:00:16.230
 chamber shows the paintings of the artist 

00:00:13.620 --> 00:00:18.810
 martin Kasper at the room perspectives 

00:00:16.230 --> 00:00:21.180
 reflections and reflect your own 

00:00:18.810 --> 00:00:23.730
 to rediscover perception and 

00:00:21.180 --> 00:00:26.039
 art lovers are so captivated 

00:00:23.730 --> 00:00:27.510
 the virtuoso sometimes dreams of it 

00:00:26.039 --> 00:00:29.010
 Scenes of our own 

00:00:27.510 --> 00:00:31.109
 be sensitive 

00:00:29.010 --> 00:00:33.989
 even the exhibition rooms are part 

00:00:31.109 --> 00:00:35.910
 the visual neck again the exciting 

00:00:33.989 --> 00:00:37.530
 is that so everything becomes the chamber and 

00:00:35.910 --> 00:00:38.700
 in the literal sense 

00:00:37.530 --> 00:00:40.200
 I want you can do that 

00:00:38.700 --> 00:00:41.879
 actually always that there the sustainable 

00:00:40.200 --> 00:00:44.520
 reinforced and that is usually in 

00:00:41.879 --> 00:00:45.539
 the music also in staircases in the room 

00:00:44.520 --> 00:00:46.680
 the case is aligned 

00:00:45.539 --> 00:00:48.870
 and that's exactly what they are 

00:00:46.680 --> 00:00:50.820
 architectural tours painted by martin kasper 

00:00:48.870 --> 00:00:52.110
 and at the same time it will be doubled 

00:00:50.820 --> 00:00:54.420
 and triples through the pictures 

00:00:52.110 --> 00:00:56.520
 specially painted for us here where 

00:00:54.420 --> 00:00:59.850
 just the real space that is pictorial 

00:00:56.520 --> 00:01:01.680
 reflect in the picture the works reflect 

00:00:59.850 --> 00:01:04.170
 yourself in the ground and they have, so to speak 

00:01:01.680 --> 00:01:06.570
 like an echo of the real exhibition in the 

00:01:04.170 --> 00:01:08.400
 picture by martin kasper so that is a 

00:01:06.570 --> 00:01:11.580
 wonderful entanglement of real and 

00:01:08.400 --> 00:01:13.770
 imaginary place starts new are the 

00:01:11.580 --> 00:01:16.320
 works of architecture and people pictures 

00:01:13.770 --> 00:01:18.840
 unite in the mutual echo and 

00:01:16.320 --> 00:01:20.220
 at the same time real and imaginary spaces 

00:01:18.840 --> 00:01:22.470
 connect with each other 

00:01:20.220 --> 00:01:24.360
 for the two-meter high screens 

00:01:22.470 --> 00:01:27.720
 stood colleagues and friends of 

00:01:24.360 --> 00:01:28.950
 Creative about 20 hours in several 

00:01:27.720 --> 00:01:31.140
 meetings model 

00:01:28.950 --> 00:01:32.850
 but the pictures painted with tempera 

00:01:31.140 --> 00:01:35.759
 betrayed more than you at first 

00:01:32.850 --> 00:01:38.759
 glimpse would be key 

00:01:35.759 --> 00:01:41.040
 that ever picture of 2008 is there like that 

00:01:38.759 --> 00:01:42.810
 that nobody is really in the picture 

00:01:41.040 --> 00:01:44.610
 but at the same time there is a dumb one 

00:01:42.810 --> 00:01:46.590
 ghettoblaster the window is on the 

00:01:44.610 --> 00:01:49.020
 shutters you can really formal 

00:01:46.590 --> 00:01:50.970
 hear the distant street noise and 

00:01:49.020 --> 00:01:52.560
 At the same time there is a sleeping bag 

00:01:50.970 --> 00:01:54.659
 refer to a person and that are 

00:01:52.560 --> 00:01:55.320
 unfamiliar pictures that the computer 

00:01:54.659 --> 00:01:57.180
 tomography 

00:01:55.320 --> 00:01:59.010
 hanging on the wall a picture in the wall 

00:01:57.180 --> 00:02:00.479

00:01:59.010 --> 00:02:02.430

00:02:00.479 --> 00:02:04.350

00:02:02.430 --> 00:02:05.729
