00:00:03.350 --> 00:00:09.800
 hello everyone so we too for a 

00:00:06.480 --> 00:00:14.030
 new video that will speak so beyond 

00:00:09.800 --> 00:00:18.359
 bus feeding in front of my crop 

00:00:14.030 --> 00:00:20.310
 so for those who followed me so I 

00:00:18.359 --> 00:00:24.000
 finished my goal so with first goal 

00:00:20.310 --> 00:00:26.580
 who was at the bottom and the second goal that 

00:00:24.000 --> 00:00:28.560
 I finished here so from him with a 

00:00:26.580 --> 00:00:29.390
 little go hop to get home 

00:00:28.560 --> 00:00:35.070
 in the goals 

00:00:29.390 --> 00:00:39.719
 quietly novelty as epic and 

00:00:35.070 --> 00:00:44.910
 just eva but my peas 

00:00:39.719 --> 00:00:49.559
 Here with a round mesh which to 

00:00:44.910 --> 00:00:51.360
 ram flavors and so the pea at 

00:00:49.559 --> 00:00:53.760
 turn every time there 

00:00:51.360 --> 00:00:56.310
 so I planted so half of 

00:00:53.760 --> 00:01:01.080
 my peas and in a week or so 

00:00:56.310 --> 00:01:02.910
 two games would sting another part of 

00:01:01.080 --> 00:01:07.260
 peas for pea 

00:01:02.910 --> 00:01:12.950
 and to him is the feeding of 

00:01:07.260 --> 00:01:15.690
 goals so I take the method actually 

00:01:12.950 --> 00:01:22.140
 two cases have holes in them 

00:01:15.690 --> 00:01:24.270
 goals like that everywhere and the 

00:01:22.140 --> 00:01:31.500
 teeth we will put the waste of 

00:01:24.270 --> 00:01:33.420
 cooking and every time we have them 

00:01:31.500 --> 00:01:35.250
 kitchen waste we are put in the 

00:01:33.420 --> 00:01:38.100
 little holes so on so that's 

00:01:35.250 --> 00:01:40.619
 we're going to do that with the family even at 

00:01:38.100 --> 00:01:43.520
 the ego so what does he do now and 

00:01:40.619 --> 00:01:46.970
 quads in their car causing obi-wan 

00:01:43.520 --> 00:01:46.970

00:02:20.580 --> 00:02:26.560
