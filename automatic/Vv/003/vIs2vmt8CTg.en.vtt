your new database so I'll just quickly

00:01:51.840 --> 00:02:05.690 
your new database so I'll just quickly
demonstrate<00:01:52.619> how<00:01:53.549> this<00:01:53.729> works

00:02:05.690 --> 00:02:05.700 

00:02:05.700 --> 00:02:13.050 

click<00:02:06.700> okay<00:02:10.470> okay<00:02:11.550> not<00:02:12.550> allowed<00:02:12.819> to<00:02:12.910> use

00:02:13.050 --> 00:02:13.060 
click okay okay not allowed to use

00:02:13.060 --> 00:02:17.430 
click okay okay not allowed to use
underscores<00:02:13.660> so<00:02:14.260> just<00:02:14.920> call<00:02:15.160> it<00:02:16.080> demo<00:02:17.080> Jupiter

00:02:17.430 --> 00:02:17.440 
underscores so just call it demo Jupiter

00:02:17.440 --> 00:02:19.559 
underscores so just call it demo Jupiter
without<00:02:17.709> the<00:02:17.860> underscore<00:02:18.250> there<00:02:18.730> we<00:02:18.819> go<00:02:18.940> so

00:02:19.559 --> 00:02:19.569 
without the underscore there we go so

00:02:19.569 --> 00:02:21.720 
without the underscore there we go so
here's<00:02:19.750> my<00:02:19.900> new<00:02:19.930> database<00:02:20.560> entry<00:02:20.980> and<00:02:21.220> I'm<00:02:21.519> not

manages<00:02:34.120> their<00:02:34.360> queue<00:02:40.739> so<00:02:41.739> I<00:02:42.010> pause<00:02:42.310> this

00:02:42.569 --> 00:02:42.579 
manages their queue so I pause this

00:02:42.579 --> 00:02:46.530

video<00:02:43.269> momentarily<00:02:44.549> while<00:02:45.549> the<00:02:45.849> database<00:02:46.269> was

00:02:46.530 --> 00:02:46.540 
video momentarily while the database was

00:02:46.540 --> 00:02:50.699 
video momentarily while the database was
in<00:02:47.370> pending<00:02:48.370> mode<00:02:48.640> and<00:02:48.989> now<00:02:49.989> I<00:02:50.019> see<00:02:50.290> the<00:02:50.410> status
