double tap on it

00:02:10.810 --> 00:02:16.229 
double tap on it
let's<00:02:11.970> back<00:02:12.970> real<00:02:13.209> quick<00:02:14.580> double<00:02:15.580> tap<00:02:16.030> on<00:02:16.180> it

00:02:16.229 --> 00:02:16.239 
let's back real quick double tap on it

00:02:16.239 --> 00:02:18.210 
let's back real quick double tap on it
and<00:02:16.450> get<00:02:16.540> a<00:02:16.569> little<00:02:16.780> target<00:02:17.200> move<00:02:17.980> around

00:02:18.210 --> 00:02:18.220 
and get a little target move around

00:02:18.220 --> 00:02:20.580 
and get a little target move around
actually<00:02:18.849> use<00:02:19.000> that<00:02:19.030> to<00:02:19.569> uh<00:02:19.599> now<00:02:20.260> we<00:02:20.319> get<00:02:20.500> the
