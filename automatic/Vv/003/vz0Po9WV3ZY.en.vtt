they<00:01:21.750> would<00:01:21.869> kind<00:01:22.080> of<00:01:22.140> miss<00:01:22.409> Rick's<00:01:22.890> group<00:01:23.070> at

00:01:23.330 --> 00:01:23.340 
they would kind of miss Rick's group at

00:01:23.340 --> 00:01:25.010 
they would kind of miss Rick's group at
terminus<00:01:23.880> or<00:01:24.090> if<00:01:24.270> they<00:01:24.390> would<00:01:24.509> make<00:01:24.689> it<00:01:24.810> there

00:01:25.010 --> 00:01:25.020 
terminus or if they would make it there

00:01:25.020 --> 00:01:27.230 
terminus or if they would make it there
or<00:01:25.290> what<00:01:26.009> exactly<00:01:26.130> would<00:01:26.490> go<00:01:26.700> down<00:01:26.880> with<00:01:27.090> that

00:01:27.230 --> 00:01:27.240 
or what exactly would go down with that

00:01:27.240 --> 00:01:28.580 
or what exactly would go down with that
but<00:01:27.390> it<00:01:27.509> seems<00:01:27.720> like<00:01:27.900> now<00:01:28.049> it's<00:01:28.229> kind<00:01:28.409> of<00:01:28.439> been

00:01:28.580 --> 00:01:28.590 
but it seems like now it's kind of been

00:01:28.590 --> 00:01:29.899 
but it seems like now it's kind of been
cemented<00:01:28.770> in<00:01:29.130> that<00:01:29.340> they're<00:01:29.460> going<00:01:29.610> to<00:01:29.700> merge

00:01:29.899 --> 00:01:29.909 
cemented in that they're going to merge

00:01:29.909 --> 00:01:31.370 
cemented in that they're going to merge
back<00:01:30.119> in<00:01:30.329> for<00:01:30.540> sure<00:01:30.750> and<00:01:30.990> one<00:01:31.110> of<00:01:31.140> the<00:01:31.229> more

00:01:31.370 --> 00:01:31.380 
back in for sure and one of the more

00:01:31.380 --> 00:01:32.690 
back in for sure and one of the more
obvious<00:01:31.530> things<00:01:32.009> that<00:01:32.130> they<00:01:32.220> gave<00:01:32.340> us<00:01:32.520> in<00:01:32.640> the

00:01:32.690 --> 00:01:32.700 
obvious things that they gave us in the

00:01:32.700 --> 00:01:34.219 
obvious things that they gave us in the
trailer<00:01:33.000> was<00:01:33.150> that<00:01:33.299> Rick's<00:01:33.509> group<00:01:33.659> does<00:01:33.960> get

00:01:34.219 --> 00:01:34.229 
trailer was that Rick's group does get

00:01:34.229 --> 00:01:36.319 
trailer was that Rick's group does get
out<00:01:34.409> of<00:01:34.560> terminus<00:01:35.009> they<00:01:35.400> are<00:01:35.640> outside<00:01:36.150> of<00:01:36.180> the

00:01:36.319 --> 00:01:36.329 
out of terminus they are outside of the

00:01:36.329 --> 00:01:38.480 
out of terminus they are outside of the
box<00:01:36.509> car<00:01:36.869> they<00:01:37.170> are<00:01:37.290> out<00:01:37.439> in<00:01:37.650> the<00:01:37.770> woods<00:01:37.950> they

00:01:38.480 --> 00:01:38.490 
box car they are out in the woods they

00:01:38.490 --> 00:01:40.249 
box car they are out in the woods they
have<00:01:38.759> weapons<00:01:38.970> it<00:01:39.479> seems<00:01:39.930> like<00:01:40.110> they've

00:01:40.249 --> 00:01:40.259 
have weapons it seems like they've

00:01:40.259 --> 00:01:41.300 
have weapons it seems like they've
gotten<00:01:40.560> out<00:01:40.619> of<00:01:40.650> terminus<00:01:41.100> and<00:01:41.189> are

00:01:41.300 --> 00:01:41.310 
gotten out of terminus and are

00:01:41.310 --> 00:01:42.740 
gotten out of terminus and are
completely<00:01:41.549> fine<00:01:42.000> from<00:01:42.210> that<00:01:42.360> and<00:01:42.450> that<00:01:42.570> did

00:01:42.740 --> 00:01:42.750 
completely fine from that and that did

00:01:42.750 --> 00:01:44.420 
completely fine from that and that did
kind<00:01:42.960> of<00:01:43.079> piss<00:01:43.259> off<00:01:43.470> quite<00:01:43.680> a<00:01:43.710> few<00:01:43.920> people<00:01:44.280> so

00:01:44.420 --> 00:01:44.430 
kind of piss off quite a few people so

00:01:44.430 --> 00:01:45.530 
kind of piss off quite a few people so
after<00:01:44.700> we've<00:01:44.850> gone<00:01:45.000> through<00:01:45.240> that<00:01:45.360> pretty

00:01:45.530 --> 00:01:45.540 
after we've gone through that pretty

00:01:45.540 --> 00:01:47.389 
after we've gone through that pretty
lengthy<00:01:45.840> list<00:01:46.229> of<00:01:46.439> bigger<00:01:46.710> things<00:01:46.860> that<00:01:47.310> they

00:01:47.389 --> 00:01:47.399 
lengthy list of bigger things that they

00:01:47.399 --> 00:01:49.249 
lengthy list of bigger things that they
actually<00:01:47.759> gave<00:01:47.880> to<00:01:48.119> us<00:01:48.149> I<00:01:48.390> have<00:01:48.750> to<00:01:48.930> agree<00:01:49.049> that

00:01:49.249 --> 00:01:49.259 
actually gave to us I have to agree that

00:01:49.259 --> 00:01:50.929 
actually gave to us I have to agree that
they<00:01:49.500> did<00:01:49.680> give<00:01:49.890> us<00:01:50.009> quite<00:01:50.340> a<00:01:50.369> bit<00:01:50.490> in<00:01:50.610> the

00:01:50.929 --> 00:01:50.939 
they did give us quite a bit in the

00:01:50.939 --> 00:01:53.240 
they did give us quite a bit in the
trailer<00:01:51.390> but<00:01:51.840> we<00:01:51.960> have<00:01:52.170> to<00:01:52.350> assume<00:01:52.619> that<00:01:52.680> AMC

00:01:53.240 --> 00:01:53.250 
trailer but we have to assume that AMC

00:01:53.250 --> 00:01:55.639 
trailer but we have to assume that AMC
did<00:01:53.490> this<00:01:53.610> almost<00:01:54.090> intentionally<00:01:54.450> we<00:01:55.439> have<00:01:55.560> to

00:01:55.639 --> 00:01:55.649 
did this almost intentionally we have to

00:01:55.649 --> 00:01:57.830 
did this almost intentionally we have to
think<00:01:55.770> about<00:01:56.040> AMC's<00:01:56.549> past<00:01:57.000> history<00:01:57.810> of

00:01:57.830 --> 00:01:57.840 
think about AMC's past history of

00:01:57.840 --> 00:01:59.899 
think about AMC's past history of
releasing<00:01:58.530> trailers<00:01:58.950> especially<00:01:59.729> in<00:01:59.820> the

00:01:59.899 --> 00:01:59.909 
releasing trailers especially in the

00:01:59.909 --> 00:02:01.609 
releasing trailers especially in the
United<00:02:00.180> States<00:02:00.240> from<00:02:00.659> what<00:02:00.869> we<00:02:00.990> know<00:02:01.200> the

00:02:01.609 --> 00:02:01.619 
United States from what we know the

00:02:01.619 --> 00:02:03.139 
United States from what we know the
foreign<00:02:01.979> ones<00:02:02.159> are<00:02:02.340> usually<00:02:02.549> way<00:02:02.909> better

00:02:03.139 --> 00:02:03.149 
foreign ones are usually way better

00:02:03.149 --> 00:02:05.030 
foreign ones are usually way better
they're<00:02:03.390> usually<00:02:03.570> more<00:02:04.049> revealing<00:02:04.500> so<00:02:04.860> the

00:02:05.030 --> 00:02:05.040 
they're usually more revealing so the

00:02:05.040 --> 00:02:06.950 
they're usually more revealing so the
u.s.<00:02:05.340> ones<00:02:05.579> are<00:02:05.700> usually<00:02:05.850> fairly<00:02:06.360> reserved

00:02:06.950 --> 00:02:06.960 
u.s. ones are usually fairly reserved

00:02:06.960 --> 00:02:09.169 
u.s. ones are usually fairly reserved
and<00:02:07.170> what<00:02:07.290> they<00:02:07.469> really<00:02:07.860> give<00:02:08.220> us<00:02:08.399> as<00:02:08.610> we<00:02:09.030> have

00:02:09.169 --> 00:02:09.179 
and what they really give us as we have

00:02:09.179 --> 00:02:10.790 
and what they really give us as we have
to<00:02:09.330> think<00:02:09.479> that<00:02:09.629> what<00:02:09.810> we<00:02:09.929> got<00:02:10.140> was<00:02:10.349> kind<00:02:10.590> of<00:02:10.649> a

00:02:10.790 --> 00:02:10.800 
to think that what we got was kind of a

00:02:10.800 --> 00:02:13.320 
to think that what we got was kind of a
snippet<00:02:11.160> of<00:02:11.430> the<00:02:11.520> craziness<00:02:12.480> that<00:02:12.660> is<00:02:13.080> the

00:02:13.320 --> 00:02:13.330 
snippet of the craziness that is the

00:02:13.330 --> 00:02:14.850 
snippet of the craziness that is the
rest<00:02:13.480> of<00:02:13.630> the<00:02:13.720> season<00:02:13.960> so<00:02:14.320> we<00:02:14.440> also<00:02:14.560> have<00:02:14.770> to

00:02:14.850 --> 00:02:14.860 
rest of the season so we also have to

00:02:14.860 --> 00:02:16.140 
rest of the season so we also have to
think<00:02:14.980> about<00:02:15.130> the<00:02:15.310> things<00:02:15.550> that<00:02:15.670> they<00:02:15.760> gave<00:02:15.970> us

00:02:16.140 --> 00:02:16.150 
think about the things that they gave us

00:02:16.150 --> 00:02:18.630 
think about the things that they gave us
and<00:02:16.360> what<00:02:16.540> did<00:02:16.690> we<00:02:16.840> realistically<00:02:17.590> expect<00:02:18.100> of

00:02:18.630 --> 00:02:18.640 
and what did we realistically expect of

00:02:18.640 --> 00:02:21.030 
and what did we realistically expect of
those<00:02:18.880> things<00:02:19.120> first<00:02:20.050> off<00:02:20.290> we<00:02:20.620> knew<00:02:20.770> that<00:02:20.920> they

00:02:21.030 --> 00:02:21.040 
those things first off we knew that they

00:02:21.040 --> 00:02:22.500 
those things first off we knew that they
get<00:02:21.220> out<00:02:21.340> of<00:02:21.430> terminus<00:02:21.790> they<00:02:21.910> cannot<00:02:22.210> spend

00:02:22.500 --> 00:02:22.510 
get out of terminus they cannot spend

00:02:22.510 --> 00:02:25.230 
get out of terminus they cannot spend
the<00:02:22.630> entire<00:02:23.020> time<00:02:23.320> in<00:02:23.620> the<00:02:23.650> boxcar<00:02:24.240> obviously

00:02:25.230 --> 00:02:25.240 
the entire time in the boxcar obviously

00:02:25.240 --> 00:02:27.390 
the entire time in the boxcar obviously
the<00:02:25.450> gara<00:02:25.780> thing<00:02:26.140> did<00:02:26.500> kind<00:02:26.770> of<00:02:26.860> throw<00:02:27.100> us<00:02:27.190> for

00:02:27.390 --> 00:02:27.400 
the gara thing did kind of throw us for

00:02:27.400 --> 00:02:29.190 
the gara thing did kind of throw us for
a<00:02:27.430> loop<00:02:27.580> that<00:02:27.820> was<00:02:28.000> interesting<00:02:28.720> but<00:02:29.050> at<00:02:29.110> the

00:02:29.190 --> 00:02:29.200 
a loop that was interesting but at the

00:02:29.200 --> 00:02:30.600 
a loop that was interesting but at the
same<00:02:29.350> time<00:02:29.530> that<00:02:29.740> kind<00:02:29.920> of<00:02:30.010> draws<00:02:30.310> a<00:02:30.340> little

00:02:30.600 --> 00:02:30.610 
same time that kind of draws a little

00:02:30.610 --> 00:02:32.100 
same time that kind of draws a little
bit<00:02:30.850> of<00:02:30.910> hype<00:02:31.180> up<00:02:31.420> it<00:02:31.600> kind<00:02:31.720> of<00:02:31.840> gets<00:02:31.930> us

00:02:32.100 --> 00:02:32.110 
bit of hype up it kind of gets us

00:02:32.110 --> 00:02:33.450 
bit of hype up it kind of gets us
thinking<00:02:32.260> about<00:02:32.620> Gareth<00:02:32.920> as<00:02:33.100> a<00:02:33.130> character

00:02:33.450 --> 00:02:33.460 
thinking about Gareth as a character

00:02:33.460 --> 00:02:35.190 
thinking about Gareth as a character
really<00:02:34.060> starts<00:02:34.360> to<00:02:34.390> how<00:02:34.540> to<00:02:34.600> drive<00:02:34.960> some

00:02:35.190 --> 00:02:35.200 
really starts to how to drive some

00:02:35.200 --> 00:02:37.080 
really starts to how to drive some
enthusiasm<00:02:35.710> for<00:02:36.130> the<00:02:36.280> show<00:02:36.520> so<00:02:36.760> I<00:02:36.790> think<00:02:36.880> that

00:02:37.080 --> 00:02:37.090 
enthusiasm for the show so I think that

00:02:37.090 --> 00:02:38.340 
enthusiasm for the show so I think that
was<00:02:37.210> one<00:02:37.360> of<00:02:37.390> the<00:02:37.510> things<00:02:37.600> that<00:02:37.780> was<00:02:37.870> probably

00:02:38.340 --> 00:02:38.350 
was one of the things that was probably

00:02:38.350 --> 00:02:40.230 
was one of the things that was probably
a<00:02:38.500> little<00:02:38.560> bit<00:02:38.740> more<00:02:38.890> carefully<00:02:39.520> given<00:02:39.970> to<00:02:40.090> us

00:02:40.230 --> 00:02:40.240 
a little bit more carefully given to us

00:02:40.240 --> 00:02:41.670 
a little bit more carefully given to us
because<00:02:40.480> we<00:02:40.690> still<00:02:40.870> don't<00:02:41.050> know<00:02:41.110> too<00:02:41.260> much

00:02:41.670 --> 00:02:41.680 
because we still don't know too much

00:02:41.680 --> 00:02:43.440 
because we still don't know too much
about<00:02:41.740> it<00:02:42.190> as<00:02:42.310> far<00:02:42.340> as<00:02:42.580> Beth<00:02:42.790> goes<00:02:43.030> we<00:02:43.300> knew

00:02:43.440 --> 00:02:43.450 
about it as far as Beth goes we knew

00:02:43.450 --> 00:02:44.880 
about it as far as Beth goes we knew
that<00:02:43.480> Beth<00:02:43.750> wasn't<00:02:44.080> going<00:02:44.230> to<00:02:44.320> die<00:02:44.470> off<00:02:44.620> camera

00:02:44.880 --> 00:02:44.890 
that Beth wasn't going to die off camera

00:02:44.890 --> 00:02:46.800 
that Beth wasn't going to die off camera
some<00:02:45.340> people<00:02:45.580> thought<00:02:45.760> she<00:02:46.030> was<00:02:46.180> Beth<00:02:46.390> burgers

00:02:46.800 --> 00:02:46.810 
some people thought she was Beth burgers

00:02:46.810 --> 00:02:49.140 
some people thought she was Beth burgers
I<00:02:46.990> have<00:02:47.950> always<00:02:48.130> thought<00:02:48.280> that<00:02:48.520> she<00:02:48.850> was<00:02:48.970> not

00:02:49.140 --> 00:02:49.150 
I have always thought that she was not

00:02:49.150 --> 00:02:51.300 
I have always thought that she was not
going<00:02:49.390> to<00:02:49.600> die<00:02:49.810> in<00:02:50.140> terminus<00:02:50.980> she<00:02:51.100> wasn't

00:02:51.300 --> 00:02:51.310 
going to die in terminus she wasn't

00:02:51.310 --> 00:02:52.860 
going to die in terminus she wasn't
going<00:02:51.430> to<00:02:51.520> die<00:02:51.700> off<00:02:51.970> camera<00:02:52.270> so<00:02:52.480> I<00:02:52.540> can<00:02:52.570> be<00:02:52.720> like

00:02:52.860 --> 00:02:52.870 
going to die off camera so I can be like

00:02:52.870 --> 00:02:54.690 
going to die off camera so I can be like
oh<00:02:52.959> that's<00:02:53.260> dead<00:02:53.500> well<00:02:54.130> guess<00:02:54.490> we'll<00:02:54.670> just

00:02:54.690 --> 00:02:54.700 
oh that's dead well guess we'll just

00:02:54.700 --> 00:02:56.820 
oh that's dead well guess we'll just
move<00:02:54.940> on<00:02:55.150> it<00:02:55.600> was<00:02:55.750> going<00:02:55.930> to<00:02:56.020> be<00:02:56.110> hey<00:02:56.470> here's

00:02:56.820 --> 00:02:56.830 
move on it was going to be hey here's

00:02:56.830 --> 00:02:58.710 
move on it was going to be hey here's
how<00:02:56.980> Beth<00:02:57.250> goes<00:02:57.520> and<00:02:57.790> proceeds<00:02:58.150> into<00:02:58.450> her

00:02:58.710 --> 00:02:58.720 
how Beth goes and proceeds into her

00:02:58.720 --> 00:03:00.480 
how Beth goes and proceeds into her
death<00:02:58.930> and<00:02:59.200> that<00:02:59.230> might<00:02:59.740> be<00:02:59.860> actually<00:03:00.070> what<00:03:00.400> we

00:03:00.480 --> 00:03:00.490 
death and that might be actually what we

00:03:00.490 --> 00:03:01.740 
death and that might be actually what we
see<00:03:00.670> in<00:03:00.760> this<00:03:00.850> season<00:03:01.209> so<00:03:01.300> I<00:03:01.330> don't<00:03:01.540> think<00:03:01.600> they

00:03:01.740 --> 00:03:01.750 
see in this season so I don't think they

00:03:01.750 --> 00:03:03.210 
see in this season so I don't think they
gave<00:03:01.900> us<00:03:01.990> too<00:03:02.170> much<00:03:02.320> information<00:03:02.590> about<00:03:03.010> her

00:03:03.210 --> 00:03:03.220 
gave us too much information about her

00:03:03.220 --> 00:03:05.220 
gave us too much information about her
either<00:03:03.490> even<00:03:03.970> with<00:03:04.090> Tyrese<00:03:04.450> and<00:03:04.480> Carol<00:03:04.930> I<00:03:05.080> mean

00:03:05.220 --> 00:03:05.230 
either even with Tyrese and Carol I mean

00:03:05.230 --> 00:03:07.080 
either even with Tyrese and Carol I mean
we<00:03:05.350> didn't<00:03:05.590> expect<00:03:05.890> them<00:03:06.100> to<00:03:06.280> stay<00:03:06.520> as<00:03:06.700> a<00:03:06.730> small

00:03:07.080 --> 00:03:07.090 
we didn't expect them to stay as a small

00:03:07.090 --> 00:03:08.850 
we didn't expect them to stay as a small
isolated<00:03:07.360> group<00:03:07.959> way<00:03:08.230> out<00:03:08.440> in<00:03:08.590> the<00:03:08.620> woods

00:03:08.850 --> 00:03:08.860 
isolated group way out in the woods

00:03:08.860 --> 00:03:10.770 
isolated group way out in the woods
forever<00:03:09.400> we<00:03:09.940> knew<00:03:10.060> at<00:03:10.180> some<00:03:10.360> point<00:03:10.570> they<00:03:10.690> were

00:03:10.770 --> 00:03:10.780 
forever we knew at some point they were

00:03:10.780 --> 00:03:12.240 
forever we knew at some point they were
probably<00:03:10.990> going<00:03:11.260> to<00:03:11.410> merge<00:03:11.560> back<00:03:11.860> in<00:03:12.100> with

00:03:12.240 --> 00:03:12.250 
probably going to merge back in with

00:03:12.250 --> 00:03:14.010 
probably going to merge back in with
Rick's<00:03:12.520> group<00:03:12.700> it<00:03:12.940> did<00:03:13.060> kind<00:03:13.270> of<00:03:13.330> squash<00:03:13.600> when

00:03:14.010 --> 00:03:14.020 
Rick's group it did kind of squash when

00:03:14.020 --> 00:03:16.110 
Rick's group it did kind of squash when
that<00:03:14.200> would<00:03:14.350> happen<00:03:14.380> or<00:03:14.950> how<00:03:15.580> it<00:03:15.790> would<00:03:15.940> happen

00:03:16.110 --> 00:03:16.120 
that would happen or how it would happen

00:03:16.120 --> 00:03:17.580 
that would happen or how it would happen
although<00:03:16.390> we<00:03:16.600> still<00:03:16.660> don't<00:03:17.020> know<00:03:17.080> too<00:03:17.230> much

00:03:17.580 --> 00:03:17.590 
although we still don't know too much

00:03:17.590 --> 00:03:18.930 
although we still don't know too much
about<00:03:17.650> that<00:03:18.070> so<00:03:18.280> I<00:03:18.310> definitely<00:03:18.519> think<00:03:18.850> that

00:03:18.930 --> 00:03:18.940 
about that so I definitely think that

00:03:18.940 --> 00:03:20.850 
about that so I definitely think that
it's<00:03:19.150> possible<00:03:19.300> that<00:03:19.600> AMC<00:03:20.050> is<00:03:20.200> also<00:03:20.560> going<00:03:20.769> to

00:03:20.850 --> 00:03:20.860 
it's possible that AMC is also going to

00:03:20.860 --> 00:03:23.280 
it's possible that AMC is also going to
troll<00:03:21.220> us<00:03:21.430> AMC<00:03:22.030> is<00:03:22.180> not<00:03:22.330> stupid<00:03:22.810> and<00:03:22.930> I<00:03:23.019> think

00:03:23.280 --> 00:03:23.290 
troll us AMC is not stupid and I think

00:03:23.290 --> 00:03:24.390 
troll us AMC is not stupid and I think
that<00:03:23.410> they<00:03:23.530> know<00:03:23.650> exactly<00:03:23.830> what<00:03:24.190> they're

00:03:24.390 --> 00:03:24.400 
that they know exactly what they're

00:03:24.400 --> 00:03:26.070 
that they know exactly what they're
giving<00:03:24.700> us<00:03:24.790> and<00:03:25.000> exactly<00:03:25.360> the<00:03:25.480> impressions

00:03:26.070 --> 00:03:26.080 
giving us and exactly the impressions

00:03:26.080 --> 00:03:27.600 
giving us and exactly the impressions
that<00:03:26.140> we're<00:03:26.320> going<00:03:26.530> to<00:03:26.620> get<00:03:26.769> from<00:03:27.100> that<00:03:27.250> stuff

00:03:27.600 --> 00:03:27.610 
that we're going to get from that stuff

00:03:27.610 --> 00:03:29.490 
that we're going to get from that stuff
so<00:03:28.120> I'm<00:03:28.180> thinking<00:03:28.510> they're<00:03:28.780> kind<00:03:29.080> of<00:03:29.110> building

00:03:29.490 --> 00:03:29.500 
so I'm thinking they're kind of building

00:03:29.500 --> 00:03:31.620 
so I'm thinking they're kind of building
us<00:03:29.680> up<00:03:29.860> and<00:03:30.070> making<00:03:30.850> us<00:03:30.970> think<00:03:31.000> that<00:03:31.239> we<00:03:31.300> know

00:03:31.620 --> 00:03:31.630 
us up and making us think that we know

00:03:31.630 --> 00:03:33.420 
us up and making us think that we know
everything<00:03:31.930> in<00:03:32.380> order<00:03:32.709> to<00:03:32.950> just<00:03:33.130> turn<00:03:33.250> the

00:03:33.420 --> 00:03:33.430 
everything in order to just turn the

00:03:33.430 --> 00:03:35.520 
everything in order to just turn the
tides<00:03:33.670> on<00:03:33.880> us<00:03:34.000> once<00:03:34.239> the<00:03:34.390> season<00:03:34.690> starts<00:03:34.720> for

00:03:35.520 --> 00:03:35.530 
tides on us once the season starts for

00:03:35.530 --> 00:03:37.229 
tides on us once the season starts for
example<00:03:35.890> what<00:03:36.070> would<00:03:36.220> happen<00:03:36.580> if<00:03:36.790> within<00:03:37.120> the

00:03:37.229 --> 00:03:37.239 
example what would happen if within the

00:03:37.239 --> 00:03:39.390 
example what would happen if within the
first<00:03:37.690> episode<00:03:38.200> or<00:03:38.320> so<00:03:38.500> they<00:03:38.950> just<00:03:39.160> killed

00:03:39.390 --> 00:03:39.400 
first episode or so they just killed

00:03:39.400 --> 00:03:41.100 
first episode or so they just killed
Gareth<00:03:39.790> off<00:03:39.940> and<00:03:40.150> completely<00:03:40.450> decimated

00:03:41.100 --> 00:03:41.110 
Gareth off and completely decimated

00:03:41.110 --> 00:03:43.949 
Gareth off and completely decimated
terminus<00:03:41.680> with<00:03:41.890> just<00:03:42.790> full<00:03:43.090> force<00:03:43.420> I<00:03:43.660> mean

00:03:43.949 --> 00:03:43.959 
terminus with just full force I mean

00:03:43.959 --> 00:03:45.420 
terminus with just full force I mean
that<00:03:44.080> would<00:03:44.260> leave<00:03:44.440> us<00:03:44.470> with<00:03:44.680> almost<00:03:45.190> nothing

00:03:45.420 --> 00:03:45.430 
that would leave us with almost nothing

00:03:45.430 --> 00:03:47.250 
that would leave us with almost nothing
we<00:03:45.730> know<00:03:45.880> that<00:03:46.090> Tyrese<00:03:46.480> is<00:03:46.630> coming<00:03:46.900> back<00:03:47.050> and

00:03:47.250 --> 00:03:47.260 
we know that Tyrese is coming back and

00:03:47.260 --> 00:03:49.199 
we know that Tyrese is coming back and
we<00:03:47.410> know<00:03:47.560> that<00:03:47.590> we<00:03:48.190> saw<00:03:48.370> a<00:03:48.400> glimpse<00:03:48.850> of<00:03:49.000> father

00:03:49.199 --> 00:03:49.209 
we know that we saw a glimpse of father

00:03:49.209 --> 00:03:50.880 
we know that we saw a glimpse of father
Gabriel<00:03:49.660> we<00:03:49.810> know<00:03:49.930> that<00:03:50.080> Beth<00:03:50.230> is<00:03:50.410> kind<00:03:50.620> of<00:03:50.739> out

00:03:50.880 --> 00:03:50.890 
Gabriel we know that Beth is kind of out

00:03:50.890 --> 00:03:52.800 
Gabriel we know that Beth is kind of out
there<00:03:50.920> doing<00:03:51.340> her<00:03:51.519> thing<00:03:51.790> and<00:03:52.060> what's<00:03:52.570> going

00:03:52.800 --> 00:03:52.810 
there doing her thing and what's going

00:03:52.810 --> 00:03:54.120 
there doing her thing and what's going
on<00:03:52.900> with<00:03:52.989> that<00:03:53.019> but<00:03:53.440> the<00:03:53.620> whole<00:03:53.800> big<00:03:54.100> thing

00:03:54.120 --> 00:03:54.130 
on with that but the whole big thing

00:03:54.130 --> 00:03:55.620 
on with that but the whole big thing
about<00:03:54.519> Gareth<00:03:54.970> and<00:03:55.120> them<00:03:55.209> going<00:03:55.420> to

00:03:55.620 --> 00:03:55.630 
about Gareth and them going to

00:03:55.630 --> 00:03:56.970 
about Gareth and them going to
Washington<00:03:56.140> and<00:03:56.230> everything<00:03:56.560> that's<00:03:56.680> kind<00:03:56.920> of

00:03:56.970 --> 00:03:56.980 
Washington and everything that's kind of

00:03:56.980 --> 00:03:58.979 
Washington and everything that's kind of
flipping<00:03:57.310> around<00:03:57.459> there<00:03:57.820> would<00:03:58.330> just<00:03:58.360> be<00:03:58.540> kind

00:03:58.979 --> 00:03:58.989 
flipping around there would just be kind

00:03:58.989 --> 00:04:00.600 
flipping around there would just be kind
of<00:03:59.110> squashed<00:03:59.380> and<00:03:59.709> if<00:03:59.769> Rick<00:04:00.070> learned<00:04:00.280> anything

00:04:00.600 --> 00:04:00.610 
of squashed and if Rick learned anything

00:04:00.610 --> 00:04:02.070 
of squashed and if Rick learned anything
from<00:04:00.820> somebody<00:04:01.330> who<00:04:01.450> says<00:04:01.690> they're<00:04:01.840> a<00:04:01.870> good

00:04:02.070 --> 00:04:02.080 
from somebody who says they're a good

00:04:02.080 --> 00:04:03.930 
from somebody who says they're a good
guy<00:04:02.230> the<00:04:02.290> governor<00:04:02.769> and<00:04:03.010> then<00:04:03.519> turns<00:04:03.700> out<00:04:03.850> to

00:04:03.930 --> 00:04:03.940 
guy the governor and then turns out to

00:04:03.940 --> 00:04:05.460 
guy the governor and then turns out to
be<00:04:03.970> an<00:04:04.120> absolute<00:04:04.600> bad<00:04:04.780> guy<00:04:04.959> he<00:04:05.170> would<00:04:05.290> just

00:04:05.460 --> 00:04:05.470 
be an absolute bad guy he would just

00:04:05.470 --> 00:04:07.380 
be an absolute bad guy he would just
kill<00:04:05.739> Gareth<00:04:06.010> the<00:04:06.220> first<00:04:06.459> chance<00:04:06.670> they<00:04:06.760> get<00:04:07.090> so

00:04:07.380 --> 00:04:07.390 
kill Gareth the first chance they get so

00:04:07.390 --> 00:04:08.970 
kill Gareth the first chance they get so
they<00:04:07.660> could<00:04:07.840> potentially<00:04:08.440> go<00:04:08.590> that<00:04:08.769> route

00:04:08.970 --> 00:04:08.980 
they could potentially go that route

00:04:08.980 --> 00:04:10.590 
they could potentially go that route
just<00:04:09.220> completely<00:04:09.640> flip<00:04:09.970> it<00:04:10.090> on<00:04:10.180> us<00:04:10.330> so<00:04:10.450> we<00:04:10.570> have

00:04:10.590 --> 00:04:10.600 
just completely flip it on us so we have

00:04:10.600 --> 00:04:12.180 
just completely flip it on us so we have
to<00:04:10.870> think<00:04:10.900> that<00:04:11.140> AMC<00:04:11.530> is<00:04:11.650> doing<00:04:11.890> this<00:04:12.010> on

00:04:12.180 --> 00:04:12.190 
to think that AMC is doing this on

00:04:12.190 --> 00:04:13.800 
to think that AMC is doing this on
purpose<00:04:12.220> I<00:04:12.760> want<00:04:13.090> to<00:04:13.150> give<00:04:13.239> them<00:04:13.360> the<00:04:13.480> benefit

00:04:13.800 --> 00:04:13.810 
purpose I want to give them the benefit

00:04:13.810 --> 00:04:15.210 
purpose I want to give them the benefit
of<00:04:13.870> the<00:04:13.959> doubt<00:04:14.170> and<00:04:14.230> think<00:04:14.680> that<00:04:14.769> they<00:04:14.920> aren't

00:04:15.210 --> 00:04:15.220 
of the doubt and think that they aren't

00:04:15.220 --> 00:04:16.650 
of the doubt and think that they aren't
completely<00:04:15.370> trying<00:04:15.910> to<00:04:16.060> give<00:04:16.180> us<00:04:16.299> everything

00:04:16.650 --> 00:04:16.660 
completely trying to give us everything

00:04:16.660 --> 00:04:18.599
