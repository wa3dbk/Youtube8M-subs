00:00:03.840 --> 00:00:07.700
 research is the basis of scientific knowledge and does not exist 

00:00:07.700 --> 00:00:10.040
 more complex than human nutrition 

00:00:10.040 --> 00:00:13.410
 better understand the processes of nutrition allows us to make decisions 

00:00:13.410 --> 00:00:15.079
 healthier 

00:00:15.079 --> 00:00:18.470
 These are just some of the institutions with which the 

00:00:18.470 --> 00:00:21.750
 health institute a lot a year to develop the science of nutrition 

00:00:21.750 --> 00:00:24.919
 of helping people achieve optimal health 

00:00:25.470 --> 00:00:27.619
 the health institute a lot to the air 

00:00:27.619 --> 00:00:30.339
 the best of nature and the best of science 

00:00:30.339 --> 00:00:33.339
 thanks to the study of human nutrition 

00:00:36.930 --> 00:00:40.170
 many adults take off from fatigue lack of energy 

00:00:40.170 --> 00:00:43.790
 low levels of solar energy will be the result of a poor diet and 

00:00:43.790 --> 00:00:47.080
 low nutrient proteins and fats and carbohydrates 

00:00:47.620 --> 00:00:51.620
 They are sources of energy but the body needs vitamin B to be able to 

00:00:51.620 --> 00:00:53.940
 convert those foods into energy 

00:00:53.940 --> 00:00:58.070
 that's why a healthy diet rich in nutrients in vitamin B3 has other 

00:00:58.070 --> 00:01:01.070
 Implementos is the key to staying energetic 

00:01:02.200 --> 00:01:06.020
 this moment of health is sponsored by the health institute did not throw to the aecc 

00:01:09.420 --> 00:01:13.409
 The decline in bone density in women usually begins at 30 

00:01:13.409 --> 00:01:13.890
 years 

00:01:13.890 --> 00:01:14.860
 the strong bones 

00:01:14.860 --> 00:01:18.030
 the dynamic and constantly break and reform 

00:01:18.030 --> 00:01:21.840
 If regular doses of calcium are not ingested, the body can divert 

00:01:21.840 --> 00:01:25.160
 reserves of this mineral contained in the bones as well as other activities 

00:01:25.159 --> 00:01:29.750
 essentials so exercise regularly maintain a diet rich in 

00:01:29.750 --> 00:01:33.310
 calcium or taking supplements that include it helps maintain bones 

00:01:33.310 --> 00:01:37.130
 firm and healthy this moment highlighted that is sponsored by the 

00:01:37.130 --> 00:01:40.130

 one has been the osiris of the antilles contains the same amount of vitamins 

00:01:46.360 --> 00:01:47.799
 and x6 oranges 

00:01:47.799 --> 00:01:50.810
 the airline has strengthened its team is the body that is a 

00:01:50.810 --> 00:01:54.499
 Water-soluble antioxidant that protects against constant attacks 

00:01:54.499 --> 00:01:56.000
 free radicals 

00:01:56.000 --> 00:02:00.510
 but not all sources of vitamin C are equal synthetic vitamin c is 

00:02:00.510 --> 00:02:01.340
 More powerful 

00:02:01.340 --> 00:02:02.140
 but it lacks 

00:02:02.140 --> 00:02:05.400
 the additional phytonutrients that you can find rows to zero balls 

00:02:06.400 --> 00:02:07.929
 this moment of health

 is sponsored by the health institute a lot on the air 

00:02:46.999 --> 00:02:50.389
 you knew that fruits and vegetables contribute much more than 

00:02:50.389 --> 00:02:51.919
 vitamins and minerals 

00:02:51.919 --> 00:02:56.139
 science has discovered that they also offer plant compounds called 

00:02:56.139 --> 00:03:00.469
 nutrients like lycopene, lutein like Merkel is flooded and thousands more 

00:03:01.089 --> 00:03:04.579
 very important to be healthy and fight heart disease 

00:03:04.579 --> 00:03:09.339
 although some cancers the more you discover the sciences said 

00:03:09.339 --> 00:03:12.229
 we will have the role of nature in good health 

00:03:12.229 --> 00:03:15.959
 this health moment is sponsored by the global health institute 

00:03:19.289 --> 00:03:23.389
 there's nothing like fresh fruits and vegetables but only because one 

00:03:23.389 --> 00:03:25.859
 apple is getting dark when it 

00:03:25.859 --> 00:03:29.699
 judis oxidation the destructive effect of free radicals in 

00:03:29.699 --> 00:03:31.279
 the healthy cells 

00:03:31.279 --> 00:03:33.669
 however when the free radicals back 

00:03:33.669 --> 00:03:34.599
 in the human body 

00:03:34.599 --> 00:03:38.909
 there is a defense against the antioxidants of fruits, vegetables and 

00:03:38.909 --> 00:03:43.090
 Vitamin supplements strengthens the body's natural defenses against 

00:03:43.090 --> 00:03:44.549
 free radicals 

00:03:44.549 --> 00:03:48.750
 at this moment of health is sponsored by the health institute fought to the 

00:03:48.749 --> 00:03:51.749
 aecc 

00:03:52.569 --> 00:03:55.699
 and is that a study by the American Medical Association recommends that 

00:03:55.699 --> 00:03:59.699
 adults take a multivitamin bush your body can not produce all the 

00:03:59.699 --> 00:04:00.990
 vitamins that they need 

00:04:00.990 --> 00:04:04.440
 It is possible that conventional mule banking will contribute without those nutrients 

00:04:04.440 --> 00:04:06.269
 fundamental 

00:04:06.269 --> 00:04:10.219
 against will achieve in heart disease and other chronic conditions 

00:04:10.219 --> 00:04:14.370
 although multivitamins or eliminate health risks the nutrients that 

00:04:14.370 --> 00:04:16.690
 contribute if they can help reduce 

00:04:16.690 --> 00:04:20.639
 this highlighted moment is sponsored by the global health institute for life 

00:04:24.249 --> 00:04:28.080
 Your body needs to ingest protein and amino acids regularly to 

00:04:28.079 --> 00:04:29.279
 stay alive 

00:04:29.279 --> 00:04:32.889
 most of them are present in red meats and derivatives of the 

00:04:32.889 --> 00:04:33.509
 milk 

00:04:33.509 --> 00:04:36.680
 but the world health organization that soy protein is 

00:04:36.680 --> 00:04:38.100
 as good as the animal 

00:04:38.100 --> 00:04:41.100
 and that contains amino acids essential for the growth of muscles 

00:04:41.819 --> 00:04:45.969
 diets low in fat and cholesterol with 25 grams of soy protein a day 

00:04:45.969 --> 00:04:50.339
 can reduce the risk of heart disease this time of

 health is sponsored by the health institute a lot to the ain 

00:04:57.340 --> 00:05:01.280
 although we should eat two servings of fish a week but who does it 

00:05:01.280 --> 00:05:05.680
 the natives player like fish every day and a study showed that it is 

00:05:05.680 --> 00:05:09.190
 a lot of risk and if it's less than getting heart disease 

00:05:09.190 --> 00:05:13.000
 that those who consume Western diets are the omega 3 fatty acids 

00:05:14.120 --> 00:05:17.440
 the icy water fish and other supplements that strengthen the 

00:05:17.440 --> 00:05:21.240
 cardiovascular system and can reduce the risk of heart disease

 this moment we are not sponsored by the health institute 

00:05:29.379 --> 00:05:32.239
 I did not know that high cholesterol contributes to millions of people 

00:05:32.239 --> 00:05:36.900
 die annually but studies from the boston internal medicine archives that 

00:05:36.899 --> 00:05:39.590
 the daily supplements of life and peasant theophilus 

00:05:39.590 --> 00:05:43.600
 it's impressive to see 25 1 reduce them by 16% 

00:05:44.319 --> 00:05:48.479
 it is believed that those phytonutrients similar cholesterol and the fifth in dragging it 

00:05:48.479 --> 00:05:49.710
 outside the body 

00:05:49.710 --> 00:05:53.610
 these clinical studies show why China at prices for centuries
