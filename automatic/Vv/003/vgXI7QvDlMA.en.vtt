little Sheen it gets on some of my older
205<00:05:43.940> 206<00:05:44.349> hardeners<00:05:45.430> it<00:05:46.430> does<00:05:46.639> a<00:05:46.669> real<00:05:46.879> good

00:05:46.899 --> 00:05:46.909 
205 206 hardeners it does a real good

00:05:46.909 --> 00:05:48.999 
205 206 hardeners it does a real good
job<00:05:47.060> of<00:05:47.300> wetting<00:05:48.080> the<00:05:48.199> wood<00:05:48.349> protecting<00:05:48.919> the

00:05:48.999 --> 00:05:49.009 
job of wetting the wood protecting the

00:05:49.009 --> 00:05:53.050 
job of wetting the wood protecting the

degrees<00:05:53.949> another<00:05:54.949> little<00:05:55.220> tip<00:05:55.370> you<00:05:55.400> can<00:05:55.669> do<00:05:55.819> is

00:05:56.020 --> 00:05:56.030 
degrees another little tip you can do is

00:05:56.030 --> 00:05:59.640 
degrees another little tip you can do is
you<00:05:56.210> can<00:05:56.389> have<00:05:56.990> a<00:05:57.050> hairspray<00:05:57.949> bottle<00:05:58.669> that<00:05:59.330> has

00:05:59.640 --> 00:05:59.650 
you can have a hairspray bottle that has

00:05:59.650 --> 00:06:02.950 
you can have a hairspray bottle that has
denatured<00:06:00.650> alcohol<00:06:00.830> in<00:06:01.370> it<00:06:01.490> and<00:06:01.669> when<00:06:01.849> it<00:06:02.000> out

00:06:02.950 --> 00:06:02.960 
denatured alcohol in it and when it out

00:06:02.960 --> 00:06:05.559 
denatured alcohol in it and when it out
cast<00:06:03.259> is<00:06:03.470> the<00:06:03.560> bubbles<00:06:03.889> and<00:06:04.430> you<00:06:04.639> just<00:06:04.849> lightly

00:06:05.559 --> 00:06:05.569 
cast is the bubbles and you just lightly

00:06:05.569 --> 00:06:08.740 
cast is the bubbles and you just lightly
mist<00:06:06.039> the<00:06:07.039> area<00:06:07.370> and<00:06:07.639> it<00:06:07.819> will<00:06:07.970> dissolve<00:06:08.360> it

00:06:08.740 --> 00:06:08.750 
mist the area and it will dissolve it

00:06:08.750 --> 00:06:11.980 
mist the area and it will dissolve it
lower<00:06:09.080> this<00:06:09.349> Casas<00:06:09.620> D<00:06:09.860> and<00:06:10.720> keep<00:06:11.720> the<00:06:11.840> bubbles

00:06:11.980 --> 00:06:11.990 
lower this Casas D and keep the bubbles

00:06:11.990 --> 00:06:15.040 
lower this Casas D and keep the bubbles
from<00:06:12.229> happening<00:06:13.659> probably<00:06:14.659> another<00:06:14.840> thing

00:06:15.040 --> 00:06:15.050 
from happening probably another thing

00:06:15.050 --> 00:06:16.379 
from happening probably another thing
you<00:06:15.169> could<00:06:15.289> do<00:06:15.380> is<00:06:15.530> do<00:06:15.650> it<00:06:15.770> later<00:06:15.979> in<00:06:16.099> a<00:06:16.190> day

00:06:16.379 --> 00:06:16.389 
you could do is do it later in a day

00:06:16.389 --> 00:06:19.540 
you could do is do it later in a day
when<00:06:17.440> when<00:06:18.440> it's<00:06:18.590> not<00:06:18.740> so<00:06:18.889> hot<00:06:19.099> when<00:06:19.400> it's

00:06:19.540 --> 00:06:19.550 
when when it's not so hot when it's

00:06:19.550 --> 00:06:21.100 
when when it's not so hot when it's
getting<00:06:19.639> cooler<00:06:20.000> it<00:06:20.479> probably<00:06:20.750> does<00:06:20.870> a<00:06:20.900> better

00:06:21.100 --> 00:06:21.110 
getting cooler it probably does a better

00:06:21.110 --> 00:06:23.800 
getting cooler it probably does a better
job<00:06:21.199> at<00:06:21.590> actually<00:06:22.599> penetrating<00:06:23.599> into<00:06:23.690> the

00:06:23.800 --> 00:06:23.810 
job at actually penetrating into the

00:06:23.810 --> 00:06:25.059 
job at actually penetrating into the
wood<00:06:23.990> and<00:06:24.020> it<00:06:24.259> rolls<00:06:24.530> it<00:06:24.680> into<00:06:24.770> the<00:06:24.919> wood

00:06:25.059 --> 00:06:25.069 
wood and it rolls it into the wood

00:06:25.069 --> 00:06:27.249 
wood and it rolls it into the wood
versus<00:06:25.490> one<00:06:25.669> at<00:06:25.789> the<00:06:25.879> heat<00:06:26.060> of<00:06:26.090> the<00:06:26.300> day<00:06:26.479> has<00:06:27.229> a

00:06:27.249 --> 00:06:27.259 
versus one at the heat of the day has a

00:06:27.259 --> 00:06:32.499 
versus one at the heat of the day has a
tendency<00:06:27.770> to<00:06:28.009> to<00:06:28.789> gas<00:06:29.599> out<00:06:30.219> so<00:06:31.219> I<00:06:31.789> choose<00:06:32.330> the

00:06:32.499 --> 00:06:32.509 
tendency to to gas out so I choose the

00:06:32.509 --> 00:06:34.600 
tendency to to gas out so I choose the
ladder<00:06:32.719> to<00:06:32.960> get<00:06:33.080> something<00:06:33.409> done<00:06:33.620> but<00:06:34.009> maybe

00:06:34.600 --> 00:06:34.610 
ladder to get something done but maybe

00:06:34.610 --> 00:06:35.800 
ladder to get something done but maybe
you've<00:06:34.819> ever<00:06:34.940> been<00:06:35.060> better<00:06:35.240> to<00:06:35.419> do<00:06:35.539> it<00:06:35.659> in<00:06:35.690> the

00:06:35.800 --> 00:06:35.810 
you've ever been better to do it in the

00:06:35.810 --> 00:06:37.499 
you've ever been better to do it in the
evenings<00:06:36.139> but<00:06:36.380> wanted<00:06:37.250> to<00:06:37.310> try<00:06:37.460> that

00:06:37.499 --> 00:06:37.509 
evenings but wanted to try that

00:06:37.509 --> 00:06:39.459 
evenings but wanted to try that
denatured<00:06:38.509> alcohol<00:06:38.659> and<00:06:39.080> this<00:06:39.139> even<00:06:39.380> work

00:06:39.459 --> 00:06:39.469 
denatured alcohol and this even work

00:06:39.469 --> 00:06:40.029 
denatured alcohol and this even work
pretty<00:06:39.650> well

00:06:40.029 --> 00:06:40.039 
pretty well

00:06:40.039 --> 00:06:42.159 
pretty well
little<00:06:40.940> miss<00:06:41.090> over<00:06:41.419> and<00:06:41.659> the<00:06:41.719> bubbles<00:06:42.020> went

00:06:42.159 --> 00:06:42.169 
little miss over and the bubbles went

00:06:42.169 --> 00:06:43.809 
little miss over and the bubbles went
away<00:06:42.259> and<00:06:42.620> just<00:06:43.009> gonna<00:06:43.159> stay<00:06:43.370> with<00:06:43.400> it<00:06:43.550> for<00:06:43.669> a

00:06:43.809 --> 00:06:43.819 
away and just gonna stay with it for a

00:06:43.819 --> 00:06:47.500 
away and just gonna stay with it for a
while<00:06:43.940> until<00:06:44.000> it<00:06:44.270> kicks<00:06:44.509> curious
