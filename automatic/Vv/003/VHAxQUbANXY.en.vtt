00:00:03.020 --> 00:00:08.450
 today i'm going to miss 

00:00:05.250 --> 00:00:08.450
 Your monster 

00:00:08.610 --> 00:00:12.900
 Normally I always do makeup 

00:00:10.530 --> 00:00:14.280
 high school tutorials and me 

00:00:12.900 --> 00:00:15.389
 she thought of water not just one 

00:00:14.280 --> 00:00:18.330
 back the school 

00:00:15.389 --> 00:00:20.310
 makeup tutorial for elementary school 

00:00:18.330 --> 00:00:21.779
 at least for the mascara and so there is 

00:00:20.310 --> 00:00:24.300
 for not nice for her because she had 

00:00:21.779 --> 00:00:26.010
 long process a little too young but I do it 

00:00:24.300 --> 00:00:28.680
 just everything and a cotton ball then 

00:00:26.010 --> 00:00:30.060
 for example some things can then can 

00:00:28.680 --> 00:00:33.750
 you good some things to stare plates 

00:00:30.060 --> 00:00:37.290
 and I will also roughly discuss this on 8 7 can 

00:00:33.750 --> 00:00:38.510
 it will wear mascara and so leave it that way 

00:00:37.290 --> 00:00:41.550
 we are going to start 

00:00:38.510 --> 00:00:43.500
 okay we start with concealer this van 

00:00:41.550 --> 00:00:47.730
 collection ' and in the color 

00:00:43.500 --> 00:00:57.289
 cooling medium two you mainly do the 

00:00:47.730 --> 00:00:57.289
 inside around the balls 

00:00:57.400 --> 00:01:02.510
 to salvage 

00:00:59.539 --> 00:01:04.430
 we cover cover ok if you don't 

00:01:02.510 --> 00:01:07.869
 sponge and on a summer class from the 

00:01:04.430 --> 00:01:07.869
 You simply need your ring finger to gas springs 

00:01:09.799 --> 00:01:14.540
 the next thing we are going to do is powder 

00:01:12.350 --> 00:01:18.290
 I have one of essence and a cast here 

00:01:14.540 --> 00:01:20.950
 from the hema and we will stop 

00:01:18.290 --> 00:01:20.950
 apply face 

00:01:21.320 --> 00:01:26.119
 makes sure you don't mind it 

00:01:24.080 --> 00:01:28.580
 shine and throughout the day so not that 

00:01:26.119 --> 00:01:32.619
 you then also run fat high you know 

00:01:28.580 --> 00:01:32.619
 and so that your concealer even cassette 

00:01:35.660 --> 00:01:39.020
 next thing you can do is plus 

00:01:37.429 --> 00:01:40.369
 apply 

00:01:39.020 --> 00:01:42.979
 I always like that very much because 

00:01:40.369 --> 00:01:47.179
 otherwise you will have such a white face 

00:01:42.979 --> 00:01:49.369
 i can here i can one 

00:01:47.179 --> 00:01:51.140
 use powder blush or cycle I have 

00:01:49.369 --> 00:01:55.700
 here a plastic ss 

00:01:51.140 --> 00:01:58.090
 in the color 030 mystics here it looks 

00:01:55.700 --> 00:01:58.090
 very strange 

00:01:58.369 --> 00:02:00.670
 really this 

00:02:00.700 --> 00:02:03.700
 hung up 

00:02:06.319 --> 00:02:08.440
 I say a little too now 

00:02:07.369 --> 00:02:11.560
 use 

00:02:08.440 --> 00:02:13.690
 And then you use your hands to get it out 

00:02:11.560 --> 00:02:15.280
 to lubricate 

00:02:13.690 --> 00:02:18.340
 like your note a very pretty one 

00:02:15.280 --> 00:02:20.890
 but light 

00:02:18.340 --> 00:02:23.830
 because the color to go on sight next 

00:02:20.890 --> 00:02:27.070
 doing is keeping the crop like I do 

00:02:23.830 --> 00:02:28.660
 said i think for her judge well now i 

00:02:27.070 --> 00:02:29.380
 wo n't go to school yet 

00:02:28.660 --> 00:02:30.850
 to do 

00:02:29.380 --> 00:02:32.770
 but if you were too close at 18 you would 

00:02:30.850 --> 00:02:35.530
 like to do it 

00:02:32.770 --> 00:02:36.940
 I can always do that if I like it 

00:02:35.530 --> 00:02:38.140
 I think it would just be young 

00:02:36.940 --> 00:02:39.400
 country 

00:02:38.140 --> 00:02:41.530
 hello he likes do i go 

00:02:39.400 --> 00:02:43.780
 tasty but is also going a bit 

00:02:41.530 --> 00:02:45.670
 for nature and the intenso 

00:02:43.780 --> 00:02:46.990
 so we always start with one 

00:02:45.670 --> 00:02:49.510
 eyeshadow base 

00:02:46.990 --> 00:02:54.990
 this eyeshadow base is from nyx in the 

00:02:49.510 --> 00:02:54.990
 color white pearl 

00:03:03.160 --> 00:03:09.080
 then we go to the eye shadow I have 

00:03:06.710 --> 00:03:12.100
 here I am a palette of urban decay 

00:03:09.080 --> 00:03:14.900
 naked basics paris a very beautiful one 

00:03:12.100 --> 00:03:17.180
 naturelle they tint did their story 

00:03:14.900 --> 00:03:23.480
 I think leaving is good for the latter 

00:03:17.180 --> 00:03:25.310
 chair and I use my family for that 

00:03:23.480 --> 00:03:28.610
 kane eats the membrane 

00:03:25.310 --> 00:03:37.880
 pellets glass of wine the first time 

00:03:28.610 --> 00:03:41.260
 to use this color is 2 ios and 

00:03:37.880 --> 00:03:41.260
 that will apply to the eyelid 

00:03:50.129 --> 00:03:55.530
 so a very natural color that 

00:03:52.950 --> 00:04:03.629
 is just for your skin color with you 

00:03:55.530 --> 00:04:05.730
 for nice basis the following 

00:04:03.629 --> 00:04:10.050
 what color we use is your sorrow 

00:04:05.730 --> 00:04:14.670
 two and then with the other side of mine 

00:04:10.050 --> 00:04:17.090
 brush and we go into the crease 

00:04:14.670 --> 00:04:17.090
 apply 

00:04:20.609 --> 00:04:26.180
 so that is the outside of your eye and 

00:04:22.440 --> 00:04:26.180
 then work inside 

00:04:32.000 --> 00:04:37.160
 and very important to be good 

00:04:33.830 --> 00:04:38.270
 so glenn remains good all the time 

00:04:37.160 --> 00:04:42.400
 to go because of course we want 

00:04:38.270 --> 00:04:42.400
 not have a whole mandala stripe 

00:04:43.540 --> 00:04:47.990
 Hundreds of color there is use is one 

00:04:45.680 --> 00:04:51.620
 highlighter and that's this it's called 

00:04:47.990 --> 00:04:57.290
 Venus Freeze therefore I do not 

00:04:51.620 --> 00:04:59.390
 penis and who will we apply to this 

00:04:57.290 --> 00:05:03.220
 the inside of your eye 

00:04:59.390 --> 00:05:06.380
 that makes you very awake on the yes 

00:05:03.220 --> 00:05:08.980
 because of your days so get up early now 

00:05:06.380 --> 00:05:08.980
 stand for school 

00:05:12.210 --> 00:05:19.259
 what we will then apply is mascara 

00:05:16.229 --> 00:05:20.910
 I also do all he said was 

00:05:19.259 --> 00:05:23.699
 well i don't think it's for trial 

00:05:20.910 --> 00:05:26.729
 but group 8 I can certainly think of myself 

00:05:23.699 --> 00:05:31.220
 also this slim advice 

00:05:26.729 --> 00:05:31.220
 at the rent false lessons in ultra black 

00:05:44.070 --> 00:05:57.240

00:05:48.180 --> 00:05:59.630
