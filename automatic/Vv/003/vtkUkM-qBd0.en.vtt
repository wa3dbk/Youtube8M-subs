realized they were going to be getting

00:02:35.910 --> 00:02:38.090 
realized they were going to be getting
this<00:02:36.239> is<00:02:36.480> going<00:02:36.900> to<00:02:36.959> be<00:02:37.020> nice<00:02:37.170> I'll<00:02:37.500> find<00:02:37.860> stuff

00:02:38.090 --> 00:02:38.100 
this is going to be nice I'll find stuff

00:02:38.100 --> 00:02:40.490 
this is going to be nice I'll find stuff
to<00:02:38.130> put<00:02:38.370> in<00:02:38.430> it<00:02:38.550> I'm<00:02:38.700> sure<00:02:38.900> they're<00:02:39.900> deep<00:02:40.170> as

00:02:40.490 --> 00:02:40.500 
to put in it I'm sure they're deep as

00:02:40.500 --> 00:02:44.540 
to put in it I'm sure they're deep as
well<00:02:41.360> these<00:02:42.360> here<00:02:42.750> are<00:02:43.130> 27<00:02:44.130> inches<00:02:44.370> out<00:02:44.520> from

00:02:44.540 --> 00:02:44.550 
well these here are 27 inches out from

00:02:44.550 --> 00:02:48.110 
well these here are 27 inches out from
the<00:02:44.850> wall<00:02:45.500> which<00:02:46.500> is<00:02:46.680> plenty<00:02:47.520> deeper<00:02:48.000> than

00:02:48.110 --> 00:02:48.120 
the wall which is plenty deeper than

00:02:48.120 --> 00:02:51.229 
the wall which is plenty deeper than
typical<00:02:48.900> cabinets<00:02:49.410> and<00:02:49.650> then<00:02:50.280> Keith<00:02:50.520> is<00:02:50.730> taken

00:02:51.229 --> 00:02:51.239 
typical cabinets and then Keith is taken

00:02:51.239 --> 00:02:56.390 
typical cabinets and then Keith is taken
and<00:02:52.280> put<00:02:53.280> oak<00:02:54.209> support<00:02:54.900> along<00:02:55.860> the<00:02:55.920> front<00:02:56.310> of

00:02:56.390 --> 00:02:56.400 
and put oak support along the front of

00:02:56.400 --> 00:03:00.190

the<00:02:56.459> shelves<00:02:56.910> in<00:02:57.060> there<00:02:57.500> for<00:02:58.500> added<00:02:58.860> strength

00:03:00.190 --> 00:03:00.200 
the shelves in there for added strength

00:03:00.200 --> 00:03:04.430 
the shelves in there for added strength
then<00:03:01.200> I've<00:03:01.410> got<00:03:02.120> these<00:03:03.120> cabinets<00:03:03.870> over<00:03:04.080> here

00:03:04.430 --> 00:03:04.440 
then I've got these cabinets over here

00:03:04.440 --> 00:03:08.630 
then I've got these cabinets over here
which<00:03:05.160> aren't<00:03:05.400> as<00:03:05.549> deep<00:03:05.989> it's<00:03:06.989> those<00:03:07.500> ones<00:03:07.830> but

00:03:08.630 --> 00:03:08.640 
which aren't as deep it's those ones but

00:03:08.640 --> 00:03:11.330 
which aren't as deep it's those ones but
this<00:03:08.970> is<00:03:09.150> where<00:03:09.330> I've<00:03:09.450> got<00:03:10.100> all<00:03:11.100> the<00:03:11.280> stuff

00:03:11.340 --> 00:03:16.280 
this is where I've got all the stuff
that<00:03:11.519> typically<00:03:12.299> typically<00:03:12.870> gets<00:03:15.140> thrown<00:03:16.140> up

00:03:16.280 --> 00:03:16.290 
that typically typically gets thrown up

00:03:16.290 --> 00:03:18.229

00:03:33.870 --> 00:03:36.370 
the yard equipment and stuff here is the
workspace<00:03:34.320> I<00:03:34.709> like<00:03:35.040> the<00:03:35.160> way<00:03:35.280> he's<00:03:35.489> got<00:03:35.760> the

00:03:36.370 --> 00:03:36.380 
workspace I like the way he's got the

00:03:36.380 --> 00:03:38.720 
workspace I like the way he's got the
spot<00:03:37.380> for<00:03:37.650> the<00:03:37.709> tool<00:03:37.950> chest<00:03:37.980> to<00:03:38.370> go<00:03:38.489> in<00:03:38.580> there

00:03:38.720 --> 00:03:38.730 
spot for the tool chest to go in there

00:03:38.730 --> 00:03:40.550 
spot for the tool chest to go in there
and<00:03:38.850> put<00:03:39.030> one<00:03:39.150> up<00:03:39.239> above<00:03:39.390> it

00:03:40.550 --> 00:03:40.560 
and put one up above it

00:03:40.560 --> 00:03:42.620 
and put one up above it
and<00:03:40.680> some<00:03:41.160> under<00:03:41.580> cabinet<00:03:42.030> lighting<00:03:42.270> in<00:03:42.480> there

00:04:53.669 --> 00:04:56.029 
garage it's some sort of reasonable
temperature<00:04:54.030> say<00:04:54.360> in<00:04:54.450> the<00:04:54.539> mid-40s<00:04:54.960> so<00:04:55.289> that's

00:04:56.029 --> 00:04:56.039 
temperature say in the mid-40s so that's

00:04:56.039 --> 00:04:57.700 
temperature say in the mid-40s so that's
kind<00:04:56.250> of<00:04:56.280> what<00:04:56.400> we're<00:04:56.520> shooting<00:04:56.669> for<00:04:56.820> but

00:04:57.700 --> 00:04:57.710 
kind of what we're shooting for but

00:04:57.710 --> 00:05:00.050 
kind of what we're shooting for but
that's<00:04:58.710> it<00:04:58.890> got<00:04:59.340> to<00:04:59.430> go<00:04:59.490> running<00:04:59.669> by<00:04:59.820> some

00:05:00.050 --> 00:05:00.060 
that's it got to go running by some

00:05:00.060 --> 00:05:02.240
