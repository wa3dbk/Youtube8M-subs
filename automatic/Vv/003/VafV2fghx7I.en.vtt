to the new bullet style and cleaned all

00:00:49.530 --> 00:00:52.130 
to the new bullet style and cleaned all
this<00:00:49.770> up<00:00:50.039> even<00:00:50.969> a<00:00:51.030> little<00:00:51.059> thing<00:00:51.420> like<00:00:51.449> that<00:00:51.629> is

00:00:52.130 --> 00:00:52.140 
this up even a little thing like that is

00:00:52.140 --> 00:00:54.229 
this up even a little thing like that is
more<00:00:52.379> aerodynamic<00:00:52.590> and<00:00:53.219> it<00:00:53.579> has<00:00:53.850> a<00:00:53.879> better

00:00:54.229 --> 00:00:54.239 
more aerodynamic and it has a better

00:00:54.239 --> 00:00:56.500 
more aerodynamic and it has a better
visibility<00:00:54.600> for<00:00:55.110> vehicles<00:00:55.770> that<00:00:55.829> around<00:00:56.129> you

visibility for vehicles that around you
we've<00:00:57.510> changed<00:00:57.809> all<00:00:58.079> the<00:00:58.230> passing<00:00:58.649> lamps

00:00:58.939 --> 00:00:58.949 
we've changed all the passing lamps

00:00:58.949 --> 00:01:00.950 
we've changed all the passing lamps
which<00:00:59.160> these<00:00:59.399> are<00:00:59.609> in<00:00:59.850> the<00:00:59.940> headlight<00:01:00.329> or<00:01:00.899> the

00:01:00.950 --> 00:01:00.960 
which these are in the headlight or the

00:01:00.960 --> 00:01:03.500 
which these are in the headlight or the
new<00:01:01.079> high<00:01:01.289> output<00:01:01.680> LEDs<00:01:02.219> the<00:01:02.879> benefit<00:01:03.329> view

00:01:03.500 --> 00:01:03.510 
new high output LEDs the benefit view

00:01:03.510 --> 00:01:05.210 
new high output LEDs the benefit view
there<00:01:03.690> is<00:01:03.719> the<00:01:04.290> bulbs<00:01:04.559> don't<00:01:04.710> burn<00:01:04.949> out<00:01:05.100> as

00:01:05.210 --> 00:01:05.220 
there is the bulbs don't burn out as

00:01:05.220 --> 00:01:07.010 
there is the bulbs don't burn out as
often<00:01:05.549> they're<00:01:05.850> cooler<00:01:06.119> there's<00:01:06.810> less

00:01:07.010 --> 00:01:07.020 
often they're cooler there's less

00:01:07.020 --> 00:01:09.200 
often they're cooler there's less
current<00:01:07.409> draw<00:01:07.590> longer<00:01:08.369> battery<00:01:08.549> life<00:01:08.729> and

00:01:09.200 --> 00:01:09.210 
current draw longer battery life and

00:01:09.210 --> 00:01:10.910 
current draw longer battery life and
probably<00:01:09.689> three<00:01:10.020> or<00:01:10.049> four<00:01:10.170> times<00:01:10.320> work

00:01:10.910 --> 00:01:10.920 
probably three or four times work

00:01:10.920 --> 00:01:13.490 
probably three or four times work
lifetime<00:01:11.850> add<00:01:12.060> these<00:01:12.270> bulbs<00:01:12.540> plus<00:01:12.900> at<00:01:13.049> night

00:01:13.490 --> 00:01:13.500 
lifetime add these bulbs plus at night

00:01:13.500 --> 00:01:15.800 
lifetime add these bulbs plus at night
these<00:01:14.070> are<00:01:14.250> headlights<00:01:14.729> tour<00:01:15.240> passing<00:01:15.600> lamps

00:01:15.800 --> 00:01:15.810 
these are headlights tour passing lamps

00:01:15.810 --> 00:01:17.840 
these are headlights tour passing lamps
are<00:01:15.930> awesome<00:01:16.380> the<00:01:17.009> brightest<00:01:17.369> headlights<00:01:17.759> and

00:01:17.840 --> 00:01:17.850 
are awesome the brightest headlights and

00:01:17.850 --> 00:01:19.789 
are awesome the brightest headlights and
I've<00:01:17.939> hit<00:01:18.119> you<00:01:18.420> know<00:01:18.509> got<00:01:18.720> 13<00:01:19.170> Harley's<00:01:19.590> I

00:01:19.789 --> 00:01:19.799 
I've hit you know got 13 Harley's I

00:01:19.799 --> 00:01:21.890 
I've hit you know got 13 Harley's I
never<00:01:20.040> had<00:01:20.220> a<00:01:20.250> headlight<00:01:20.640> life<00:01:20.880> beats<00:01:21.150> not

00:01:21.890 --> 00:01:21.900 
never had a headlight life beats not

00:01:21.900 --> 00:01:24.560 
never had a headlight life beats not
only<00:01:22.140> we<00:01:22.290> change<00:01:22.560> that<00:01:22.830> the<00:01:23.460> front<00:01:23.759> forks<00:01:24.180> this

00:01:24.560 --> 00:01:24.570 
only we change that the front forks this

00:01:24.570 --> 00:01:25.880 
only we change that the front forks this
part<00:01:24.810> of<00:01:24.900> the<00:01:24.990> fourth<00:01:25.229> it's<00:01:25.439> not<00:01:25.590> permanent

00:01:25.880 --> 00:01:25.890 
part of the fourth it's not permanent

00:01:25.890 --> 00:01:28.219 
part of the fourth it's not permanent
it's<00:01:26.759> eight<00:01:27.090> millimeters<00:01:27.720> bigger<00:01:28.020> and

00:01:28.219 --> 00:01:28.229 
it's eight millimeters bigger and

00:01:28.229 --> 00:01:30.620 
it's eight millimeters bigger and
diameter<00:01:28.710> and<00:01:28.979> by<00:01:29.159> doing<00:01:29.400> that<00:01:29.549> there's<00:01:30.360> more

00:01:30.620 --> 00:01:30.630 
diameter and by doing that there's more

00:01:30.630 --> 00:01:32.840 
diameter and by doing that there's more
spring<00:01:31.049> in<00:01:31.229> that<00:01:31.350> there's<00:01:31.590> more<00:01:31.770> tension<00:01:32.040> it

00:01:32.840 --> 00:01:32.850 
spring in that there's more tension it

00:01:32.850 --> 00:01:35.450 
spring in that there's more tension it
gives<00:01:33.030> a<00:01:33.150> better<00:01:33.329> more<00:01:33.659> stable<00:01:34.409> ride<00:01:34.619> and<00:01:34.920> made

00:01:35.450 --> 00:01:35.460 
gives a better more stable ride and made

00:01:35.460 --> 00:01:37.340 
gives a better more stable ride and made
the<00:01:35.549> bike<00:01:35.729> easier<00:01:36.240> to<00:01:36.329> handle<00:01:36.720> at<00:01:36.780> low<00:01:36.960> speeds

00:01:37.340 --> 00:01:37.350 
the bike easier to handle at low speeds

00:01:37.350 --> 00:01:39.530 
the bike easier to handle at low speeds
and<00:01:37.650> on<00:01:38.250> rougher<00:01:38.759> roads<00:01:38.909> for<00:01:39.270> both<00:01:39.390> the

00:01:39.530 --> 00:01:39.540 
and on rougher roads for both the

00:01:39.540 --> 00:01:41.600 
and on rougher roads for both the
passenger<00:01:39.780> and<00:01:40.079> the<00:01:40.200> driver<00:01:40.560> not<00:01:41.310> just<00:01:41.549> so

00:01:41.600 --> 00:01:41.610 
passenger and the driver not just so

00:01:41.610 --> 00:01:43.550 
passenger and the driver not just so
much<00:01:41.729> that<00:01:41.790> it's<00:01:42.000> bigger<00:01:42.299> but<00:01:42.960> it's<00:01:43.110> a<00:01:43.200> heavier

00:01:43.550 --> 00:01:43.560 
much that it's bigger but it's a heavier

00:01:43.560 --> 00:01:45.020 
much that it's bigger but it's a heavier
front<00:01:43.860> end<00:01:43.979> and<00:01:44.070> works<00:01:44.250> better

00:01:45.020 --> 00:01:45.030 
front end and works better
