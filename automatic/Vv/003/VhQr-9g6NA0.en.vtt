notebook and this just kind of takes a
little<00:01:31.950> bit<00:01:32.070> of<00:01:32.220> trial<00:01:32.490> and<00:01:32.610> error<00:01:32.820> to<00:01:33.180> get<00:01:33.299> the

00:01:33.440 --> 00:01:33.450 
little bit of trial and error to get the

00:01:33.450 --> 00:01:35.929 
little bit of trial and error to get the
right<00:01:33.630> size<00:01:33.869> but<00:01:34.170> it's<00:01:34.409> pretty<00:01:34.590> easy<00:01:34.710> so<00:01:35.610> once

00:01:35.929 --> 00:01:35.939 
right size but it's pretty easy so once

00:01:35.939 --> 00:01:37.730 
right size but it's pretty easy so once
you<00:01:36.119> are<00:01:36.360> happy<00:01:36.630> with<00:01:36.840> the<00:01:37.229> size<00:01:37.409> of<00:01:37.680> your

00:01:37.730 --> 00:01:37.740 
you are happy with the size of your

00:01:37.740 --> 00:01:39.469 
you are happy with the size of your
paper<00:01:38.040> you<00:01:38.369> want<00:01:38.520> to<00:01:38.579> take<00:01:38.790> some<00:01:39.060> Mod<00:01:39.240> Podge

00:01:39.469 --> 00:01:39.479 
paper you want to take some Mod Podge

00:01:39.479 --> 00:01:42.020 
paper you want to take some Mod Podge
and<00:01:39.900> a<00:01:40.170> sponge<00:01:40.530> and<00:01:40.890> just<00:01:41.159> coat<00:01:41.369> the<00:01:41.579> top<00:01:41.790> of

00:01:42.020 --> 00:01:42.030 
and a sponge and just coat the top of

00:01:42.030 --> 00:01:44.090 
and a sponge and just coat the top of
your<00:01:42.180> notebook<00:01:42.570> with<00:01:42.750> it<00:01:42.930> it's<00:01:43.380> important<00:01:43.890> to

00:01:44.090 --> 00:01:44.100 
your notebook with it it's important to

00:01:44.100 --> 00:01:45.679 
your notebook with it it's important to
get<00:01:44.310> the<00:01:44.490> edges<00:01:44.909> of<00:01:45.060> the<00:01:45.180> notebook<00:01:45.540> because

00:01:45.679 --> 00:01:45.689 
get the edges of the notebook because

00:01:45.689 --> 00:01:47.749 
get the edges of the notebook because
that's<00:01:46.110> where<00:01:46.320> the<00:01:46.470> paper<00:01:46.740> will<00:01:47.070> probably

00:01:47.749 --> 00:01:47.759 
that's where the paper will probably

00:01:47.759 --> 00:01:49.340 
that's where the paper will probably
peel<00:01:48.090> first<00:01:48.420> if<00:01:48.659> it<00:01:48.780> was<00:01:48.869> trying<00:01:49.110> to<00:01:49.170> come<00:01:49.320> off

00:01:49.340 --> 00:01:49.350 
peel first if it was trying to come off

00:01:49.350 --> 00:01:51.740 
peel first if it was trying to come off
so<00:01:50.009> make<00:01:50.220> sure<00:01:50.250> you<00:01:50.549> have<00:01:50.759> a<00:01:50.790> good<00:01:51.119> coat<00:01:51.390> of<00:01:51.630> it

00:01:51.740 --> 00:01:51.750 
so make sure you have a good coat of it

00:01:51.750 --> 00:01:53.450 
so make sure you have a good coat of it
and<00:01:51.960> then<00:01:52.049> you<00:01:52.229> can<00:01:52.380> go<00:01:52.500> ahead<00:01:52.590> and<00:01:52.799> place<00:01:53.220> on

00:01:53.450 --> 00:01:53.460 
and then you can go ahead and place on

00:01:53.460 --> 00:01:55.819 
and then you can go ahead and place on
your<00:01:53.700> paper<00:01:53.939> just<00:01:54.600> press<00:01:54.840> down<00:01:55.049> the<00:01:55.110> edges<00:01:55.619> and

00:01:55.819 --> 00:01:55.829 
your paper just press down the edges and

00:01:55.829 --> 00:01:57.350 
your paper just press down the edges and
hold<00:01:56.009> it<00:01:56.130> for<00:01:56.280> a<00:01:56.310> little<00:01:56.369> bit<00:01:56.549> and<00:01:56.820> you're<00:01:57.210> all

00:02:12.210 --> 00:02:12.220 

00:02:12.220 --> 00:02:14.890 

this<00:02:13.220> next<00:02:13.459> notebook<00:02:13.879> is<00:02:14.000> also<00:02:14.420> inspired<00:02:14.780> by

00:02:14.890 --> 00:02:14.900 
this next notebook is also inspired by

00:02:14.900 --> 00:02:16.720 
this next notebook is also inspired by
something<00:02:15.290> I<00:02:15.379> saw<00:02:15.590> it<00:02:15.709> urban<00:02:16.069> so<00:02:16.280> basically<00:02:16.610> I

00:02:16.720 --> 00:02:16.730 
something I saw it urban so basically I

00:02:16.730 --> 00:02:18.400 
something I saw it urban so basically I
looked<00:02:17.030> online<00:02:17.209> for<00:02:17.390> an<00:02:17.720> image<00:02:18.019> of<00:02:18.170> like

00:02:18.400 --> 00:02:18.410 
looked online for an image of like

00:02:18.410 --> 00:02:20.380 
looked online for an image of like
mountains<00:02:18.890> because<00:02:19.370> I<00:02:19.400> think<00:02:19.670> mountains<00:02:20.150> are

00:02:20.380 --> 00:02:20.390 
mountains because I think mountains are

00:02:20.390 --> 00:02:21.940 
mountains because I think mountains are
really<00:02:20.690> pretty<00:02:20.900> and<00:02:21.200> sometimes<00:02:21.590> it's<00:02:21.769> nice<00:02:21.890> to

00:02:21.940 --> 00:02:21.950 
really pretty and sometimes it's nice to

00:02:21.950 --> 00:02:23.589 
really pretty and sometimes it's nice to
have<00:02:22.099> a<00:02:22.220> notebook<00:02:22.400> with<00:02:22.700> something<00:02:23.060> cool<00:02:23.300> on

00:02:23.589 --> 00:02:23.599 
have a notebook with something cool on

00:02:23.599 --> 00:02:25.210 
have a notebook with something cool on
it<00:02:24.080> so<00:02:24.260> what<00:02:24.379> I<00:02:24.410> did<00:02:24.500> was<00:02:24.739> I<00:02:24.860> put<00:02:25.040> it<00:02:25.129> in

00:02:25.210 --> 00:02:25.220 
it so what I did was I put it in

00:02:25.220 --> 00:02:27.250 
it so what I did was I put it in
PicMonkey<00:02:25.790> and<00:02:26.030> sized<00:02:26.360> it<00:02:26.599> so<00:02:26.780> it<00:02:26.900> would<00:02:27.049> fit

00:02:27.250 --> 00:02:27.260 
PicMonkey and sized it so it would fit

00:02:27.260 --> 00:02:29.199 
PicMonkey and sized it so it would fit
like<00:02:27.290> a<00:02:27.470> regular<00:02:27.890> piece<00:02:28.129> of<00:02:28.160> printer<00:02:28.640> paper<00:02:28.819> I

00:02:29.199 --> 00:02:29.209 
like a regular piece of printer paper I

00:02:29.209 --> 00:02:31.539 
like a regular piece of printer paper I
will<00:02:29.269> put<00:02:29.690> the<00:02:29.810> dimensions<00:02:30.440> like<00:02:31.040> on<00:02:31.220> the

00:02:31.539 --> 00:02:31.549 
will put the dimensions like on the

00:02:31.549 --> 00:02:33.369 
will put the dimensions like on the
screen<00:02:31.790> so<00:02:31.970> you<00:02:32.030> can<00:02:32.060> see<00:02:32.330> it<00:02:32.420> and<00:02:32.629> then<00:02:33.110> what<00:02:33.349> I

00:02:33.369 --> 00:02:33.379 
screen so you can see it and then what I

00:02:33.379 --> 00:02:35.320 
screen so you can see it and then what I
did<00:02:33.470> was<00:02:33.890> on<00:02:34.099> PicMonkey<00:02:34.760> if<00:02:34.940> you<00:02:35.030> click<00:02:35.239> the

00:02:35.320 --> 00:02:35.330 
did was on PicMonkey if you click the

00:02:35.330 --> 00:02:37.539 
did was on PicMonkey if you click the
little<00:02:35.450> butterfly<00:02:35.930> icon<00:02:36.379> it<00:02:36.620> will<00:02:37.129> come<00:02:37.519> up

00:02:37.539 --> 00:02:37.549 
little butterfly icon it will come up

00:02:37.549 --> 00:02:39.699 
little butterfly icon it will come up
with<00:02:37.640> these<00:02:37.879> like<00:02:38.030> geometric<00:02:38.360> overlays<00:02:39.260> and<00:02:39.560> I

00:02:39.699 --> 00:02:39.709 
with these like geometric overlays and I

00:02:39.709 --> 00:02:41.589 
with these like geometric overlays and I
just<00:02:39.950> picked<00:02:40.099> the<00:02:40.190> triangle<00:02:40.700> one<00:02:40.879> I<00:02:41.150> put<00:02:41.360> it<00:02:41.450> on

00:02:41.589 --> 00:02:41.599 
just picked the triangle one I put it on

00:02:41.599 --> 00:02:43.539 
just picked the triangle one I put it on
a<00:02:41.630> paint<00:02:41.959> color<00:02:42.170> and<00:02:42.290> just<00:02:42.650> faded<00:02:43.130> it<00:02:43.250> just

00:02:43.539 --> 00:02:43.549 
a paint color and just faded it just

00:02:43.549 --> 00:02:45.819 
a paint color and just faded it just
like<00:02:43.700> that<00:02:43.910> it's<00:02:44.450> really<00:02:44.720> easy<00:02:44.840> and<00:02:45.380> then<00:02:45.620> I

00:02:45.819 --> 00:02:45.829 
like that it's really easy and then I

00:02:45.829 --> 00:02:47.920 
like that it's really easy and then I
just<00:02:46.160> printed<00:02:46.549> off<00:02:46.700> the<00:02:46.849> image<00:02:47.060> again<00:02:47.420> on<00:02:47.810> that

00:02:47.920 --> 00:02:47.930 
just printed off the image again on that

00:02:47.930 --> 00:02:49.509 
just printed off the image again on that
in<00:02:48.049> glossy<00:02:48.380> paper<00:02:48.590> that<00:02:48.920> way<00:02:49.069> it<00:02:49.190> looks<00:02:49.370> a

00:02:49.509 --> 00:02:49.519 
in glossy paper that way it looks a

00:02:49.519 --> 00:02:51.160 
in glossy paper that way it looks a
little<00:02:49.640> bit<00:02:49.880> more<00:02:50.060> professional<00:02:50.690> and<00:02:50.870> trimmed

00:02:51.160 --> 00:02:51.170 
little bit more professional and trimmed

00:02:51.170 --> 00:02:53.020 
little bit more professional and trimmed
out<00:02:51.319> the<00:02:51.440> edges<00:02:51.799> and<00:02:51.980> this<00:02:52.430> process<00:02:52.880> is

00:02:53.020 --> 00:02:53.030 
out the edges and this process is

00:02:53.030 --> 00:02:54.309 
out the edges and this process is
basically<00:02:53.420> like<00:02:53.630> the<00:02:53.780> other<00:02:53.930> one<00:02:54.140> but<00:02:54.290> I

00:02:54.309 --> 00:02:54.319 
basically like the other one but I

00:02:54.319 --> 00:02:55.690 
basically like the other one but I
wanted<00:02:54.590> to<00:02:54.650> give<00:02:54.829> you<00:02:54.920> guys<00:02:55.069> two<00:02:55.340> ideas
