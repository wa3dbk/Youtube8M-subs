one-handed and the two-handed our tools
are<00:00:51.989> very<00:00:52.020> similar<00:00:52.680> to<00:00:53.039> the<00:00:53.219> actual<00:00:53.820> dark

00:00:54.229 --> 00:00:54.239 
are very similar to the actual dark

00:00:54.239 --> 00:00:58.279 
are very similar to the actual dark
great<00:00:54.890> strong<00:00:55.890> attacks<00:00:56.840> which<00:00:57.840> actually<00:00:58.199> is

00:00:58.279 --> 00:00:58.289 
great strong attacks which actually is

00:00:58.289 --> 00:01:02.170 
great strong attacks which actually is
pretty<00:00:58.440> neat<00:00:59.359> so<00:01:00.359> I<00:01:00.390> might<00:01:01.350> actually<00:01:01.500> use<00:01:01.890> this

00:01:02.170 --> 00:01:02.180 
pretty neat so I might actually use this

00:01:02.180 --> 00:01:04.820 
pretty neat so I might actually use this
weapon<00:01:03.180> if<00:01:03.449> I<00:01:03.600> do<00:01:03.660> another<00:01:04.080> you<00:01:04.439> know<00:01:04.530> just

00:01:04.820 --> 00:01:04.830 
weapon if I do another you know just

00:01:04.830 --> 00:01:07.219 
weapon if I do another you know just
random<00:01:05.159> plate<00:01:05.640> for<00:01:05.850> what<00:01:06.090> not<00:01:06.270> the<00:01:06.720> problem<00:01:07.110> is

00:01:07.219 --> 00:01:07.229 
random plate for what not the problem is

00:01:07.229 --> 00:01:08.600 
random plate for what not the problem is
it<00:01:07.409> takes<00:01:07.560> a<00:01:07.740> little<00:01:07.920> time<00:01:08.010> to<00:01:08.340> get<00:01:08.460> this

00:01:08.600 --> 00:01:08.610 
it takes a little time to get this

00:01:08.610 --> 00:01:11.690 
it takes a little time to get this
weapon<00:01:08.820> you<00:01:09.000> can't<00:01:09.270> get<00:01:09.450> it<00:01:09.540> right<00:01:09.659> away<00:01:10.700> yeah

00:01:11.690 --> 00:01:11.700 
weapon you can't get it right away yeah

00:01:11.700 --> 00:01:14.270 
weapon you can't get it right away yeah
I<00:01:11.760> like<00:01:12.119> the<00:01:12.270> way<00:01:12.360> the<00:01:12.479> sword<00:01:12.720> looks<00:01:13.070> it<00:01:14.070> has<00:01:14.250> a

00:01:14.270 --> 00:01:14.280 
I like the way the sword looks it has a

00:01:14.280 --> 00:01:16.880 
I like the way the sword looks it has a
decent<00:01:14.580> move<00:01:15.000> set<00:01:15.299> it's<00:01:16.200> just<00:01:16.439> that<00:01:16.650> the

00:01:16.880 --> 00:01:16.890 
decent move set it's just that the

00:01:16.890 --> 00:01:21.080 
decent move set it's just that the
strong<00:01:17.280> attacks<00:01:17.640> are<00:01:17.850> pretty<00:01:18.090> slow<00:01:18.560> as<00:01:20.090> you'll

00:01:21.080 --> 00:01:21.090 
strong attacks are pretty slow as you'll

00:01:21.090 --> 00:01:23.870 
strong attacks are pretty slow as you'll
see<00:01:21.299> here<00:01:21.570> in<00:01:21.659> a<00:01:21.869> little<00:01:22.380> bit<00:01:22.530> when<00:01:23.369> I<00:01:23.400> take<00:01:23.700> on

00:01:23.870 --> 00:01:23.880

see here in a little bit when I take on
the<00:01:24.000> dark<00:01:24.150> race<00:01:24.390> it's<00:01:25.259> a<00:01:25.500> slow<00:01:26.340> attack<00:01:26.520> but<00:01:27.090> uh

00:01:27.130 --> 00:01:27.140 
the dark race it's a slow attack but uh

00:01:27.140 --> 00:01:31.690 
the dark race it's a slow attack but uh
looks<00:01:28.140> pretty<00:01:28.350> cool

00:01:31.690 --> 00:01:31.700 

00:01:31.700 --> 00:01:34.190
