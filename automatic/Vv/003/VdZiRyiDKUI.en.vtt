but
I<00:02:22.909> always<00:02:23.420> come<00:02:23.689> back<00:02:23.749> to<00:02:23.930> growing<00:02:24.370> lots<00:02:25.370> of

00:02:25.509 --> 00:02:25.519 
I always come back to growing lots of

00:02:25.519 --> 00:02:28.839 
I always come back to growing lots of
different<00:02:25.849> kinds<00:02:26.060> of<00:02:26.150> tomatoes<00:02:26.390> I<00:02:27.849> started

00:02:28.839 --> 00:02:28.849 
different kinds of tomatoes I started

00:02:28.849 --> 00:02:32.649 
different kinds of tomatoes I started
out<00:02:28.969> I<00:02:29.299> don't<00:02:29.810> know<00:02:30.129> 1974<00:02:31.129> and<00:02:32.060> I<00:02:32.150> decided<00:02:32.510> I

00:02:32.649 --> 00:02:32.659 
out I don't know 1974 and I decided I

00:02:32.659 --> 00:02:36.220 
out I don't know 1974 and I decided I
wanted<00:02:32.870> to<00:02:32.930> grow<00:02:33.170> a<00:02:33.200> tomato<00:02:35.200> inside<00:02:36.200> a

00:02:36.220 --> 00:02:36.230 
wanted to grow a tomato inside a

00:02:36.230 --> 00:02:37.869 
wanted to grow a tomato inside a
greenhouse<00:02:36.739> it<00:02:36.980> tasted<00:02:37.310> like<00:02:37.459> it<00:02:37.489> was<00:02:37.670> growing

00:02:37.869 --> 00:02:37.879 
greenhouse it tasted like it was growing

00:02:37.879 --> 00:02:42.580 
greenhouse it tasted like it was growing
outside<00:02:38.420> I<00:02:40.780> think<00:02:41.780> I<00:02:41.870> pretty<00:02:42.019> well<00:02:42.260> got<00:02:42.379> away

00:02:42.580 --> 00:02:42.590 
outside I think I pretty well got away

00:02:42.590 --> 00:02:45.670 
outside I think I pretty well got away
with<00:02:42.769> that<00:02:42.799> and<00:02:43.069> over<00:02:43.219> the<00:02:43.340> years<00:02:44.469> and<00:02:45.469> now<00:02:45.650> I

00:02:45.670 --> 00:02:45.680 
with that and over the years and now I

00:02:45.680 --> 00:02:48.970 
with that and over the years and now I
like<00:02:45.980> to<00:02:46.069> grow<00:02:46.250> them<00:02:46.370> outside<00:02:47.500> even<00:02:48.500> more<00:02:48.829> than

00:02:48.970 --> 00:02:48.980 
like to grow them outside even more than

00:02:48.980 --> 00:02:51.550 
like to grow them outside even more than
in<00:02:49.099> the<00:02:49.219> greenhouse<00:02:49.579> because<00:02:49.849> it's<00:02:50.030> a<00:02:50.120> I<00:02:50.560> get

00:02:51.550 --> 00:02:51.560 
in the greenhouse because it's a I get

00:02:51.560 --> 00:02:55.959 
in the greenhouse because it's a I get
to<00:02:51.680> rotate<00:02:52.069> around<00:02:52.219> the<00:02:52.549> field<00:02:54.760> which<00:02:55.760> i<00:02:55.909> think

00:02:55.959 --> 00:02:55.969 
to rotate around the field which i think

00:02:55.969 --> 00:02:58.750 
to rotate around the field which i think
is<00:02:56.150> pretty<00:02:56.329> healthy
