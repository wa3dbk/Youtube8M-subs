to<00:05:18.640> people<00:05:18.670> in<00:05:19.210> a<00:05:19.300> totally<00:05:19.720> different

00:05:20.040 --> 00:05:20.050 
to people in a totally different

00:05:20.050 --> 00:05:23.760 
to people in a totally different
language<00:05:20.470> it's<00:05:21.300> entirely<00:05:22.300> different<00:05:22.870> and<00:05:23.080> so

00:05:23.760 --> 00:05:23.770 
language it's entirely different and so

00:05:23.770 --> 00:05:26.220 
language it's entirely different and so
I<00:05:24.010> think<00:05:24.220> I<00:05:24.700> became<00:05:25.090> a<00:05:25.150> better<00:05:25.390> communicated

00:05:26.220 --> 00:05:26.230 
I think I became a better communicated

00:05:26.230 --> 00:05:28.730 
I think I became a better communicated
in<00:05:26.350> terms<00:05:26.590> of<00:05:26.740> like<00:05:26.950> pictures<00:05:27.820> and<00:05:28.180> like

00:05:28.730 --> 00:05:28.740

buddy-buddy language and gestures and

00:05:33.910 --> 00:05:35.550 
buddy-buddy language and gestures and
everything<00:05:34.360> so<00:05:34.810> I<00:05:35.080> think<00:05:35.140> that's<00:05:35.380> really

00:05:35.550 --> 00:05:35.560 
everything so I think that's really
