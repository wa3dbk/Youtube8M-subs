00:00:08.840 --> 00:00:09.920
 Hello everyone, I am RXSFAI. 

00:00:09.920 --> 00:00:12.300
 It’s time for the BF4 equipment series video. 

00:00:12.340 --> 00:00:15.940
 In this series of videos, I will try to use my message list for my equipment. 

00:00:15.940 --> 00:00:20.160
 Make a assessment based on the accessories and equipment 

00:00:20.440 --> 00:00:23.180
 So if you have any complete equipment list, I want to try it out. 

00:00:23.180 --> 00:00:25.320
 Don't forget to leave a message and leave your gear 

00:00:25.440 --> 00:00:28.940
 I will choose one of the comments for the next topic. 

00:00:29.280 --> 00:00:31.840
 This time the equipment is from Li Jiaqi. 

00:00:32.140 --> 00:00:34.360
 The main weapon is the SAIGA 12K shotgun 

00:00:34.580 --> 00:00:39.440
 Accessories use cobra [inside red dot], laser sight, 12G deer, right angle grip 

00:00:39.800 --> 00:00:44.740
 The secondary weapon uses the M412 REX revolver, fitted with a metal sight, and the green point laser sight 

00:00:44.900 --> 00:00:49.660
 Equipped with one M18 wide knife mine or C4 explosive, equipped with two ammunition boxes 

00:00:50.000 --> 00:00:52.440
 Grenade uses M67 fragment 

00:00:52.760 --> 00:00:56.340
 Battlefield upgrade skill selection [defense], army knife is carbon fiber knife 

00:00:56.620 --> 00:01:00.820
 SAIGA 12K is a semi-automatic shotgun of BF4 

00:01:01.120 --> 00:01:06.000
 Its eight rounds of ammunition plus a bullet in the cavity, a total of nine bullets 

00:01:06.060 --> 00:01:08.800
 Can hit 200 bullets per minute 

00:01:09.120 --> 00:01:13.400
 Since different shotguns will have different numbers of built-in projectiles 

00:01:13.620 --> 00:01:17.340
 There are a total of nine projectiles in the SAIGA 12K shotgun. 

00:01:17.560 --> 00:01:21.840
 Calculated the deer bomb used this time, the highest damage can be as high as 162 

00:01:22.280 --> 00:01:27.400
 In theory, at close range, even if you hit any one bit, you can kill the enemy. 

00:01:27.600 --> 00:01:32.780
 But your nine projectiles must also hit the enemy in full to reach this damage. 

00:01:33.140 --> 00:01:37.220
 When DICE designed the shotgun, in order to avoid the shotgun too OP 

00:01:37.460 --> 00:01:40.500
 Therefore, in addition to investigating the extent of the spread after the launch of the projectile 

00:01:40.540 --> 00:01:44.160
 Also subdivided the bullet into a certain number of projectiles. 

00:01:44.420 --> 00:01:49.000
 Make each projectile calculate the damage and accuracy independently 

00:01:49.120 --> 00:01:53.760
 So that other guns will not necessarily lose to the shotgun at close range. 

00:01:54.400 --> 00:01:58.780
 In addition, because the projectile projectiles of the shotgun are individually calculated separately 

00:01:59.000 --> 00:02:04.400
 So the last shot of the enemy may only be 2-3 of them. 

00:02:04.740 --> 00:02:06.120
 Especially when using lumbar shots 

00:02:06.120 --> 00:02:14.300
 You have a great chance, even if you illuminate the entire magazine, or aim at the enemy with a good waist, you will not be able to hit it. 

00:02:14.300 --> 00:02:20.940
 So I suggest that when everyone uses a shotgun, everyone should aim at it as soon as possible. 

00:02:21.140 --> 00:02:28.920
 In order to make the projectile more concentrated and not too distracting, I will also install the beam picker every time I use the shotgun. 

00:02:29.160 --> 00:02:32.100
 As for whether to use a modified beam picker or a full beam picker 

00:02:32.100 --> 00:02:36.780
 It depends on whether you prefer to use the waist, or aim at the fire. 

00:02:37.100 --> 00:02:40.920
 However, the lumbar shot of the shotgun is terrible. 

00:02:41.140 --> 00:02:44.600
 So still use the full beam picker. 

00:02:44.600 --> 00:02:47.860
 Ammunition, because SAIGA 12K is semi-automatic 

00:02:47.860 --> 00:02:51.280
 So no matter what kind of ammunition you use, there are no special disadvantages. 

00:02:51.480 --> 00:02:56.020
 For the grip, the semi-automatically fired gun, fitted with a right angle grip, will of course be the most suitable. 

00:02:56.280 --> 00:03:00.640
 Needless to say, the shotgun should also know that it can have its advantages at close range. 

00:03:00.840 --> 00:03:07.800
 So basically only in the team, or the map of the infantry war will have a chance to use 

00:03:07.980 --> 00:03:14.840
 But on these maps, because the map is not big, everyone relies heavily on small maps to find enemies. 

00:03:15.020 --> 00:03:19.560
 In the BF4, the barrel fitting of the shotgun is without a silencer. 

00:03:19.780 --> 00:03:23.720
 So when you shoot with a shotgun, you will appear on the enemy's small map, and anyone can find you. 

00:03:23.720 --> 00:03:32.860
 Compared to other gun types, they can be equipped with a silencer to hide themselves, and the range will be farther than the shotgun. 

00:03:32.900 --> 00:03:38.960
 In addition, in the map design, in fact, there are many maps in the BF4 that are not suitable for using shotguns. 

00:03:39.160 --> 00:03:44.720
 Because there are quite a few maps of BF4, the core design is based on the large conquest model. 

00:03:45.080 --> 00:03:50.500
 Including the reason just mentioned, most players also think that at close range 

00:03:50.640 --> 00:03:55.240
 High-speed guns are more powerful and more practical than shotguns. 

00:03:55.400 --> 00:03:59.980
 So the shotgun is not used by many people in the BF4. 

00:04:00.280 --> 00:04:04.180
 And these reasons are also why I don’t really like to use shotguns. 

00:04:04.460 --> 00:04:08.040
 Finally, answer the questions of the netizens who provided the equipment. 

00:04:08.200 --> 00:04:12.680
 SAIGA 12K and DBV-12 are actually no different. 

00:04:13.060 --> 00:04:19.540
 Whether it is the rate of fire, the number of shots, or the diffusion value representing the accuracy is the same. 

00:04:19.620 --> 00:04:27.940
 But the DBV-12 is a bullet that is two more shots than the SAIGA 12K, and the bombing time is a little faster. 

00:04:28.340 --> 00:04:35.340
 So if you have unlocked DBV-12, I think there should be no reason to continue to use SAIGA 12K. 

00:04:35.660 --> 00:04:37.640
 I said it this time. 

00:04:37.700 --> 00:04:41.100
 Battlefield Hardline will be officially released next week. 

00:04:41.100 --> 00:04:46.960
 I should release a single-player video and a review video of the entire game in that one or two days. 

00:04:47.520 --> 00:04:54.120
 So if you are still thinking about buying BFH, you can look at my assessment before you think about it. 

00:04:54.160 --> 00:04:58.040
 Thank you for watching, we will see you in the next video, byebye
