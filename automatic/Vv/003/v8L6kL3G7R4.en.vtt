00:00:02.450 --> 00:00:02.460 
this week I'm talking more about

00:00:02.460 --> 00:00:04.789 
this week I'm talking more about
blocking<00:00:03.110> because<00:00:04.110> I<00:00:04.200> realized<00:00:04.529> I<00:00:04.620> wasn't

00:00:04.789 --> 00:00:04.799 
blocking because I realized I wasn't

00:00:04.799 --> 00:00:06.889 
blocking because I realized I wasn't
quite<00:00:05.069> finished<00:00:05.339> the<00:00:06.150> SWOT<00:00:06.390> you're<00:00:06.600> looking

00:00:06.889 --> 00:00:06.899 
quite finished the SWOT you're looking

00:00:06.899 --> 00:00:09.740 
quite finished the SWOT you're looking
at<00:00:07.049> right<00:00:07.259> here<00:00:07.319> is<00:00:07.890> a<00:00:08.400> properly<00:00:09.000> blocked

00:00:09.740 --> 00:00:09.750 
at right here is a properly blocked

00:00:09.750 --> 00:00:10.790 
at right here is a properly blocked
swatch

00:00:10.790 --> 00:00:10.800 
swatch

00:00:10.800 --> 00:00:12.770 
swatch
it's<00:00:11.190> got<00:00:11.370> ribbing<00:00:11.670> at<00:00:11.820> the<00:00:11.910> bottom<00:00:12.240> and

00:00:12.770 --> 00:00:12.780 
it's got ribbing at the bottom and

00:00:12.780 --> 00:00:15.410 
it's got ribbing at the bottom and
stockinette<00:00:13.650> at<00:00:13.769> the<00:00:13.860> top<00:00:14.070> and<00:00:14.460> the<00:00:15.059> ribbing

00:00:15.410 --> 00:00:15.420 
stockinette at the top and the ribbing

00:00:15.420 --> 00:00:17.779 
stockinette at the top and the ribbing
is<00:00:15.660> just<00:00:16.199> barely<00:00:16.590> planned<00:00:17.100> and<00:00:17.279> pinned<00:00:17.640> in

00:00:17.779 --> 00:00:17.789 
is just barely planned and pinned in

00:00:17.789 --> 00:00:19.700 
is just barely planned and pinned in
place<00:00:18.029> and<00:00:18.330> when<00:00:18.480> I<00:00:18.510> block<00:00:18.869> this<00:00:19.170> I<00:00:19.350> use<00:00:19.529> my

00:00:19.700 --> 00:00:19.710 
place and when I block this I use my

00:00:19.710 --> 00:00:21.170 
place and when I block this I use my
fingers<00:00:20.160> to<00:00:20.189> kind<00:00:20.609> of<00:00:20.699> smoosh<00:00:20.939> it<00:00:20.970> together

00:00:21.170 --> 00:00:21.180 
fingers to kind of smoosh it together

00:00:21.180 --> 00:00:23.450 
fingers to kind of smoosh it together
because<00:00:22.050> I<00:00:22.080> don't<00:00:22.410> want<00:00:22.710> to<00:00:22.920> distort<00:00:23.340> the

00:00:23.450 --> 00:00:23.460 
because I don't want to distort the

00:00:23.460 --> 00:00:25.820 
because I don't want to distort the
ribbing<00:00:24.019> generally<00:00:25.019> when<00:00:25.170> you<00:00:25.230> have<00:00:25.260> ribbing

00:00:25.820 --> 00:00:25.830 
ribbing generally when you have ribbing

00:00:25.830 --> 00:00:27.560 
ribbing generally when you have ribbing
at<00:00:25.949> the<00:00:26.039> bottom<00:00:26.310> of<00:00:26.430> a<00:00:26.519> project<00:00:27.029> it<00:00:27.269> is

00:00:27.560 --> 00:00:27.570 
at the bottom of a project it is

00:00:27.570 --> 00:00:30.410 
at the bottom of a project it is
supposed<00:00:28.170> to<00:00:28.349> be<00:00:28.529> ribbed<00:00:28.830> and<00:00:29.220> if<00:00:30.029> you<00:00:30.210> pull<00:00:30.390> it

00:00:30.410 --> 00:00:30.420 
supposed to be ribbed and if you pull it

00:00:30.420 --> 00:00:32.810 
supposed to be ribbed and if you pull it
too<00:00:30.689> much<00:00:30.869> it's<00:00:31.769> no<00:00:31.980> longer<00:00:32.219> ribbed<00:00:32.579> it

00:00:32.810 --> 00:00:32.820 
too much it's no longer ribbed it

00:00:32.820 --> 00:00:34.389 
too much it's no longer ribbed it
becomes<00:00:33.120> just<00:00:33.390> a<00:00:33.540> stitch<00:00:33.780> pattern<00:00:33.809> then

00:00:34.389 --> 00:00:34.399 
becomes just a stitch pattern then

00:00:34.399 --> 00:00:37.069 
becomes just a stitch pattern then
here's<00:00:35.399> a<00:00:35.489> swatch<00:00:35.910> and<00:00:36.239> it's<00:00:36.390> exactly<00:00:36.870> the

00:00:37.069 --> 00:00:37.079 
here's a swatch and it's exactly the

00:00:37.079 --> 00:00:38.780 
here's a swatch and it's exactly the
same<00:00:37.260> number<00:00:37.620> of<00:00:37.649> stitches<00:00:37.920> as<00:00:38.309> the<00:00:38.460> other<00:00:38.579> one

00:00:38.780 --> 00:00:38.790 
same number of stitches as the other one

00:00:38.790 --> 00:00:42.619 
same number of stitches as the other one
that<00:00:39.270> has<00:00:40.280> been<00:00:41.280> over<00:00:41.640> blocked<00:00:41.940> and<00:00:42.329> noticed

00:00:42.619 --> 00:00:42.629 
that has been over blocked and noticed

00:00:42.629 --> 00:00:45.229 
that has been over blocked and noticed
how<00:00:42.809> the<00:00:42.870> ribbing<00:00:43.320> has<00:00:43.559> been<00:00:43.770> pulled<00:00:44.040> flat<00:00:44.370> and

00:00:45.229 --> 00:00:45.239 
how the ribbing has been pulled flat and

00:00:45.239 --> 00:00:46.940 
how the ribbing has been pulled flat and
the<00:00:45.390> reason<00:00:45.660> I<00:00:45.719> decided<00:00:45.780> to<00:00:46.200> include<00:00:46.559> this<00:00:46.739> is

00:00:46.940 --> 00:00:46.950 
the reason I decided to include this is

00:00:46.950 --> 00:00:48.830 
the reason I decided to include this is
it<00:00:47.100> frequently<00:00:47.579> this<00:00:47.879> is<00:00:48.059> how<00:00:48.210> the<00:00:48.270> swatches

00:00:48.830 --> 00:00:48.840 
it frequently this is how the swatches

00:00:48.840 --> 00:00:51.110 
it frequently this is how the swatches
are<00:00:48.989> sent<00:00:49.230> in<00:00:49.440> for<00:00:49.829> the<00:00:50.100> basics<00:00:50.489> course<00:00:50.730> and

00:00:51.110 --> 00:00:51.120 
are sent in for the basics course and

00:00:51.120 --> 00:00:53.930 
are sent in for the basics course and
for<00:00:51.989> the<00:00:52.140> master's<00:00:52.530> program<00:00:52.559> as<00:00:53.010> well<00:00:53.219> notice

00:00:53.930 --> 00:00:53.940 
for the master's program as well notice

00:00:53.940 --> 00:00:56.720 
for the master's program as well notice
that<00:00:54.059> the<00:00:54.149> stockinette<00:00:54.600> stitch<00:00:55.320> is<00:00:55.860> pulled

00:00:56.720 --> 00:00:56.730 
that the stockinette stitch is pulled

00:00:56.730 --> 00:00:59.240 
that the stockinette stitch is pulled
too<00:00:56.940> tight<00:00:56.969> it<00:00:57.449> looks<00:00:57.480> like<00:00:57.989> lace<00:00:58.410> that's<00:00:59.010> not

00:00:59.240 --> 00:00:59.250 
too tight it looks like lace that's not

00:00:59.250 --> 00:01:00.830 
too tight it looks like lace that's not
the<00:00:59.399> way<00:00:59.520> stockinette<00:01:00.090> is<00:01:00.210> supposed<00:01:00.510> to<00:01:00.570> look

00:01:00.830 --> 00:01:00.840 
the way stockinette is supposed to look

00:01:00.840 --> 00:01:05.030 
the way stockinette is supposed to look
it's<00:01:01.379> supposed<00:01:02.070> to<00:01:02.489> look<00:01:02.670> like<00:01:02.730> that<00:01:02.969> so<00:01:04.040> you

00:01:05.030 --> 00:01:05.040 
it's supposed to look like that so you

00:01:05.040 --> 00:01:06.500 
it's supposed to look like that so you
just<00:01:05.369> need<00:01:05.460> to<00:01:05.519> be<00:01:05.670> careful<00:01:06.000> with<00:01:06.150> the<00:01:06.240> ribbing

00:01:06.500 --> 00:01:06.510 
just need to be careful with the ribbing

00:01:06.510 --> 00:01:08.450 
just need to be careful with the ribbing
now<00:01:07.020> the<00:01:07.080> one<00:01:07.380> thing<00:01:07.530> you<00:01:07.650> never<00:01:07.799> ever<00:01:08.130> ever

iron<00:01:11.939> too<00:01:12.450> close<00:01:12.780> to<00:01:13.049> ribbing<00:01:13.350> it's<00:01:13.619> mush<00:01:14.100> is

00:01:14.270 --> 00:01:14.280 
iron too close to ribbing it's mush is

00:01:14.280 --> 00:01:16.640 
iron too close to ribbing it's mush is
it<00:01:14.460> it<00:01:14.729> flattens<00:01:15.479> the<00:01:15.570> stitches<00:01:15.960> and<00:01:16.170> it<00:01:16.320> is<00:01:16.439> no

00:01:16.640 --> 00:01:16.650 
it it flattens the stitches and it is no

00:01:16.650 --> 00:01:18.859 
it it flattens the stitches and it is no
longer<00:01:16.860> ribbing<00:01:17.369> now<00:01:18.270> the<00:01:18.330> other<00:01:18.509> thing<00:01:18.750> I

longer ribbing now the other thing I
have<00:01:19.020> gathered<00:01:19.500> for<00:01:20.310> this<00:01:20.490> video<00:01:20.790> is<00:01:21.210> some

00:01:21.440 --> 00:01:21.450 
have gathered for this video is some

00:01:21.450 --> 00:01:23.719 
have gathered for this video is some
cable<00:01:21.840> swatches<00:01:22.380> and<00:01:22.770> cables<00:01:23.369> are<00:01:23.520> another

00:01:23.719 --> 00:01:23.729 
cable swatches and cables are another

00:01:23.729 --> 00:01:26.179 
cable swatches and cables are another
area<00:01:23.939> where<00:01:24.360> knitters<00:01:24.840> sometimes<00:01:25.290> get<00:01:25.530> just<00:01:25.920> a

00:01:26.179 --> 00:01:26.189 
area where knitters sometimes get just a

00:01:26.189 --> 00:01:28.700 
area where knitters sometimes get just a
little<00:01:26.220> too<00:01:26.540> enthusiastic<00:01:27.540> and<00:01:28.080> it<00:01:28.350> depends

00:01:28.700 --> 00:01:28.710 
little too enthusiastic and it depends

00:01:28.710 --> 00:01:30.350 
little too enthusiastic and it depends
on<00:01:28.770> what<00:01:28.979> you<00:01:29.100> want<00:01:29.280> the<00:01:29.430> final<00:01:29.820> product<00:01:30.240> to

00:01:30.350 --> 00:01:30.360 
on what you want the final product to

00:01:30.360 --> 00:01:32.420 
on what you want the final product to
look<00:01:30.509> like<00:01:30.750> now<00:01:30.960> this<00:01:31.170> is<00:01:31.320> a<00:01:31.350> swatch<00:01:31.680> that<00:01:32.040> it

00:01:32.420 --> 00:01:32.430 
look like now this is a swatch that it

00:01:32.430 --> 00:01:35.149 
look like now this is a swatch that it
for<00:01:32.729> a<00:01:32.759> sweater<00:01:33.030> that<00:01:33.119> I<00:01:33.299> did<00:01:33.600> forecast<00:01:34.110> on<00:01:34.409> and

00:01:35.149 --> 00:01:35.159 
for a sweater that I did forecast on and

00:01:35.159 --> 00:01:40.130 
for a sweater that I did forecast on and
I<00:01:35.729> wanted<00:01:36.360> it<00:01:36.570> to<00:01:36.930> be<00:01:38.150> smooth<00:01:39.150> and<00:01:39.360> flat<00:01:39.630> but<00:01:40.110> I

00:01:40.130 --> 00:01:40.140 
I wanted it to be smooth and flat but I

00:01:40.140 --> 00:01:42.910 
I wanted it to be smooth and flat but I
wanted<00:01:40.470> the<00:01:40.619> cables<00:01:41.009> to<00:01:41.159> really<00:01:41.460> pop<00:01:41.700> so<00:01:42.270> I

00:01:42.910 --> 00:01:42.920 
wanted the cables to really pop so I

00:01:42.920 --> 00:01:46.819 
wanted the cables to really pop so I
when<00:01:43.920> I<00:01:43.950> block<00:01:44.250> this<00:01:44.549> I<00:01:45.020> blocked<00:01:46.020> it<00:01:46.229> but<00:01:46.259> I<00:01:46.470> did

00:01:46.819 --> 00:01:46.829 
when I block this I blocked it but I did

00:01:46.829 --> 00:01:49.730 
when I block this I blocked it but I did
not<00:01:47.070> stretch<00:01:47.820> it<00:01:48.119> at<00:01:48.329> all<00:01:48.570> i<00:01:48.899> smoothed<00:01:49.380> it<00:01:49.619> with

gauge swatch because I want these cables
which<00:02:34.740> are<00:02:34.860> very<00:02:35.070> large<00:02:35.340> to<00:02:35.910> be<00:02:36.170> appear<00:02:37.170> more

00:02:37.370 --> 00:02:37.380 
which are very large to be appear more

00:02:37.380 --> 00:02:39.770 
which are very large to be appear more
embossed<00:02:37.920> and<00:02:38.430> these<00:02:38.940> are<00:02:39.090> from<00:02:39.210> a<00:02:39.330> skirt<00:02:39.600> that

00:02:39.770 --> 00:02:39.780 
embossed and these are from a skirt that

00:02:39.780 --> 00:02:42.260 
embossed and these are from a skirt that
I<00:02:39.810> did<00:02:40.050> where<00:02:40.350> the<00:02:40.500> cables<00:02:41.030> progressively<00:02:42.030> got

00:02:42.260 --> 00:02:42.270 
I did where the cables progressively got

00:02:42.270 --> 00:02:44.330 
I did where the cables progressively got
smaller<00:02:42.600> and<00:02:42.870> smaller<00:02:43.260> and<00:02:43.680> so<00:02:44.160> they<00:02:44.280> were

00:02:44.330 --> 00:02:44.340 
smaller and smaller and so they were

00:02:44.340 --> 00:02:46.340 
smaller and smaller and so they were
quite<00:02:44.610> fat<00:02:44.970> at<00:02:45.150> the<00:02:45.210> bottom<00:02:45.600> and<00:02:45.810> I<00:02:46.020> wanted

00:02:46.340 --> 00:02:46.350 
quite fat at the bottom and I wanted

00:02:46.350 --> 00:02:48.770 
quite fat at the bottom and I wanted
them<00:02:46.500> very<00:02:46.830> very<00:02:47.100> very<00:02:47.280> flat<00:02:47.670> so<00:02:48.060> I<00:02:48.090> stretched

00:02:48.770 --> 00:02:48.780 
them very very very flat so I stretched

00:02:48.780 --> 00:02:52.580 
them very very very flat so I stretched
this<00:02:49.140> guy<00:02:49.460> out<00:02:51.050> depending<00:02:52.050> on<00:02:52.140> how<00:02:52.380> you<00:02:52.440> want

00:02:55.190 --> 00:02:55.200 
the final product to look is how you

00:02:55.200 --> 00:02:57.320 
the final product to look is how you
should<00:02:55.260> block<00:02:55.890> things<00:02:56.460> like<00:02:56.670> cables<00:02:57.090> and

00:02:57.320 --> 00:02:57.330 
should block things like cables and

00:02:57.330 --> 00:02:59.510 
should block things like cables and
ribbing<00:02:57.870> but<00:02:58.440> you<00:02:58.530> need<00:02:58.680> to<00:02:58.770> be<00:02:58.860> very<00:02:59.070> careful

00:02:59.510 --> 00:02:59.520 
ribbing but you need to be very careful

00:02:59.520 --> 00:03:01.640 
ribbing but you need to be very careful
that<00:02:59.550> you<00:02:59.850> don't<00:03:00.090> stretch<00:03:00.840> it<00:03:00.870> out<00:03:01.140> if<00:03:01.470> that's

00:03:01.640 --> 00:03:01.650 
that you don't stretch it out if that's

00:03:01.650 --> 00:03:03.410 
that you don't stretch it out if that's
not<00:03:01.950> into<00:03:02.220> your<00:03:02.400> intention<00:03:03.030> or<00:03:03.180> you're<00:03:03.300> not

00:03:03.410 --> 00:03:03.420 
not into your intention or you're not
