fourth Hokage Minato obito discussion

00:04:51.960 --> 00:04:55.490 
fourth Hokage Minato obito discussion
because<00:04:52.650> it<00:04:52.770> looks<00:04:52.979> very<00:04:53.069> well<00:04:53.610> liked<00:04:53.940> in<00:04:54.500> the

00:04:55.490 --> 00:04:55.500 
because it looks very well liked in the

00:04:55.500 --> 00:04:59.029 
because it looks very well liked in the
other<00:04:55.680> dimension<00:04:56.669> area<00:04:57.419> right<00:04:57.900> that<00:04:58.500> little

00:04:59.029 --> 00:04:59.039 
other dimension area right that little

00:04:59.039 --> 00:05:01.010 
other dimension area right that little
pocket<00:04:59.250> dimension<00:04:59.580> that<00:04:59.970> obito<00:05:00.330> is<00:05:00.720> going<00:05:00.930> to

00:05:01.010 --> 00:05:01.020 
pocket dimension that obito is going to

00:05:01.020 --> 00:05:03.050 
pocket dimension that obito is going to
get<00:05:01.139> killed<00:05:01.409> so<00:05:02.039> we<00:05:02.220> may<00:05:02.400> never<00:05:02.550> have<00:05:02.880> that

00:05:03.050 --> 00:05:03.060 
get killed so we may never have that

00:05:03.060 --> 00:05:04.460 
get killed so we may never have that
conversation<00:05:03.120> that<00:05:03.990> seems<00:05:04.229> kind<00:05:04.440> of

00:05:04.460 --> 00:05:04.470 
conversation that seems kind of

00:05:04.470 --> 00:05:06.080 
conversation that seems kind of
disappointing<00:05:05.130> but<00:05:05.280> that<00:05:05.819> would<00:05:05.940> have<00:05:06.030> been

00:05:06.080 --> 00:05:06.090 
disappointing but that would have been

00:05:06.090 --> 00:05:08.390 
disappointing but that would have been
like<00:05:06.389> several<00:05:06.780> chapters<00:05:07.110> I<00:05:07.470> think<00:05:07.770> right

00:05:08.390 --> 00:05:08.400 
like several chapters I think right

00:05:08.400 --> 00:05:10.159 
like several chapters I think right
there<00:05:08.669> in<00:05:08.789> and<00:05:08.909> of<00:05:09.000> itself<00:05:09.120> now<00:05:09.479> maybe<00:05:09.659> why<00:05:09.960> we

00:05:10.159 --> 00:05:10.169 
there in and of itself now maybe why we

00:05:10.169 --> 00:05:12.649 
there in and of itself now maybe why we
don't<00:05:10.319> get<00:05:10.560> it<00:05:10.710> simply<00:05:11.250> it's<00:05:11.880> simply<00:05:12.270> so<00:05:12.449> much

00:05:12.649 --> 00:05:12.659 
don't get it simply it's simply so much

don't get it simply it's simply so much
