proponent of drinking milk although I
feel<00:00:05.580> for<00:00:05.879> milk<00:00:06.240> to<00:00:06.480> be<00:00:06.690> healthy<00:00:07.290> it<00:00:07.500> should<00:00:08.010> be

00:00:08.179 --> 00:00:08.189 
feel for milk to be healthy it should be

00:00:08.189 --> 00:00:11.540 
feel for milk to be healthy it should be
raw<00:00:08.460> and<00:00:08.730> not<00:00:09.660> just<00:00:10.170> raw<00:00:10.440> it<00:00:10.950> should<00:00:11.219> be<00:00:11.370> from

00:00:11.540 --> 00:00:11.550 
raw and not just raw it should be from

00:00:11.550 --> 00:00:13.549 
raw and not just raw it should be from
cows<00:00:11.880> that<00:00:11.910> are<00:00:12.210> raised<00:00:12.570> on<00:00:12.750> a<00:00:12.809> real<00:00:13.139> farm

00:00:13.549 --> 00:00:13.559 
cows that are raised on a real farm

00:00:13.559 --> 00:00:16.820

metal concrete industrial feed and

00:00:23.130 --> 00:00:26.210 
metal concrete industrial feed and
antibiotics<00:00:23.970> will<00:00:24.600> not<00:00:24.840> be<00:00:25.080> healthy<00:00:25.590> whether

00:00:26.210 --> 00:00:26.220 
antibiotics will not be healthy whether

00:00:26.220 --> 00:00:27.710 
antibiotics will not be healthy whether
its<00:00:26.460> raw<00:00:26.670> or<00:00:26.820> pasteurized

00:00:27.710 --> 00:00:27.720 
its raw or pasteurized

00:00:27.720 --> 00:00:30.259 
its raw or pasteurized
now<00:00:28.050> I<00:00:28.080> prefer<00:00:28.380> raw<00:00:28.920> over<00:00:29.400> pasteurized<00:00:30.060> so<00:00:30.119> I

00:00:30.259 --> 00:00:30.269 
now I prefer raw over pasteurized so I

00:00:30.269 --> 00:00:32.540 
now I prefer raw over pasteurized so I
can<00:00:30.480> get<00:00:30.630> the<00:00:30.810> healthy<00:00:31.230> probiotics<00:00:32.160> and<00:00:32.340> no

00:00:32.540 --> 00:00:32.550 
can get the healthy probiotics and no

00:00:32.550 --> 00:00:35.209 
can get the healthy probiotics and no
another<00:00:33.540> reason<00:00:33.899> for<00:00:33.930> keeping<00:00:34.350> it<00:00:34.440> raw<00:00:34.620> is<00:00:34.920> to

00:00:35.209 --> 00:00:35.219 
another reason for keeping it raw is to

00:00:35.219 --> 00:00:37.790 
another reason for keeping it raw is to
leave<00:00:35.430> the<00:00:35.579> enzymes<00:00:36.210> functional<00:00:36.960> so<00:00:37.469> they<00:00:37.620> can

00:00:37.790 --> 00:00:37.800 
leave the enzymes functional so they can

00:00:37.800 --> 00:00:39.830 
leave the enzymes functional so they can
help<00:00:37.980> with<00:00:38.160> digestion<00:00:38.640> and<00:00:39.000> many<00:00:39.600> other

flowing with milk and honey the promised

00:01:14.310 --> 00:01:16.910 
flowing with milk and honey the promised
land<00:01:14.659> now<00:01:15.659> I'd<00:01:15.750> love<00:01:15.900> to<00:01:15.960> report<00:01:16.380> to<00:01:16.560> you<00:01:16.680> when

00:01:16.910 --> 00:01:16.920 
land now I'd love to report to you when

00:01:16.920 --> 00:01:18.649 
land now I'd love to report to you when
there's<00:01:17.130> new<00:01:17.400> evidence<00:01:17.430> for<00:01:18.299> a<00:01:18.330> traditional

00:01:18.649 --> 00:01:18.659 
there's new evidence for a traditional

00:01:18.659 --> 00:01:21.890 
there's new evidence for a traditional
practice<00:01:19.320> like<00:01:20.220> drinking<00:01:20.700> raw<00:01:20.880> milk<00:01:20.909> so<00:01:21.840> you

00:01:21.890 --> 00:01:21.900 
practice like drinking raw milk so you

00:01:21.900 --> 00:01:24.410 
practice like drinking raw milk so you
can<00:01:22.200> see<00:01:22.409> that<00:01:22.560> maybe<00:01:22.950> our<00:01:23.159> modern<00:01:23.820> culture

00:01:24.410 --> 00:01:24.420 
can see that maybe our modern culture

00:01:24.420 --> 00:01:26.600 
can see that maybe our modern culture
has<00:01:24.630> it<00:01:24.840> wrong<00:01:25.049> and<00:01:25.350> maybe<00:01:25.920> we<00:01:26.250> would<00:01:26.430> be

00:01:26.600 --> 00:01:26.610 
has it wrong and maybe we would be

00:01:26.610 --> 00:01:30.230 
has it wrong and maybe we would be
better<00:01:26.970> off<00:01:27.560> taking<00:01:28.560> the<00:01:28.680> time<00:01:28.950> to<00:01:29.280> go<00:01:29.490> back<00:01:29.520> to

00:01:30.230 --> 00:01:30.240 
better off taking the time to go back to

00:01:30.240 --> 00:01:32.899 
better off taking the time to go back to
the<00:01:30.450> old<00:01:30.659> ways<00:01:30.960> so<00:01:31.890> today<00:01:32.159> I<00:01:32.189> want<00:01:32.460> to<00:01:32.549> tell<00:01:32.759> you

00:01:32.899 --> 00:01:32.909 
the old ways so today I want to tell you

00:01:32.909 --> 00:01:35.810 
the old ways so today I want to tell you
about<00:01:33.030> another<00:01:34.280> nutritional<00:01:35.280> compound
