less than 30 minutes so what I'm going

00:00:15.780 --> 00:00:17.720 
less than 30 minutes so what I'm going
to<00:00:15.839> be<00:00:15.929> doing<00:00:16.020> is<00:00:16.230> starting<00:00:16.650> my<00:00:16.830> actually

00:00:17.720 --> 00:00:17.730 
to be doing is starting my actually

00:00:17.730 --> 00:00:19.820 
to be doing is starting my actually
curling<00:00:18.330> with<00:00:18.510> the<00:00:18.600> straightener<00:00:19.080> and<00:00:19.289> the

00:00:19.820 --> 00:00:19.830 
curling with the straightener and the

00:00:19.830 --> 00:00:20.900 
curling with the straightener and the
reason<00:00:20.070> we're<00:00:20.189> doing<00:00:20.220> that<00:00:20.369> is<00:00:20.490> because<00:00:20.640> it's

00:00:20.900 --> 00:00:20.910 
reason we're doing that is because it's

00:00:20.910 --> 00:00:22.670 
reason we're doing that is because it's
a<00:00:20.970> great<00:00:21.270> curl<00:00:21.539> to<00:00:21.720> pinup<00:00:22.020> and<00:00:22.050> it's<00:00:22.380> really

00:00:22.670 --> 00:00:22.680 
a great curl to pinup and it's really

00:00:22.680 --> 00:00:24.710 
a great curl to pinup and it's really
really<00:00:22.980> fast<00:00:23.250> to<00:00:23.490> do<00:00:23.640> so<00:00:24.420> I'm<00:00:24.480> going<00:00:24.570> to<00:00:24.630> be

00:00:24.710 --> 00:00:24.720 
really fast to do so I'm going to be

00:00:24.720 --> 00:00:26.870 
really fast to do so I'm going to be
using<00:00:24.930> the<00:00:25.439> feel<00:00:25.680> the<00:00:25.859> heat<00:00:26.099> intelligent

00:00:26.870 --> 00:00:26.880 
using the feel the heat intelligent

00:00:26.880 --> 00:00:29.120 
using the feel the heat intelligent
styler<00:00:27.359> and<00:00:27.570> we<00:00:28.529> should<00:00:28.710> show<00:00:28.980> you<00:00:29.010> my

styler and we should show you my

00:00:29.130 --> 00:00:31.130 
styler and we should show you my
sectioning<00:00:29.760> patterns<00:00:30.060> here<00:00:30.300> so<00:00:30.929> we're<00:00:31.050> going

00:00:31.130 --> 00:00:31.140 
sectioning patterns here so we're going

00:00:31.140 --> 00:00:33.500 
sectioning patterns here so we're going
to<00:00:31.199> take<00:00:31.349> our<00:00:31.560> sectioning<00:00:32.070> pattern<00:00:32.510> exactly

put<00:01:05.430> your<00:01:05.549> straightener<00:01:06.000> in<00:01:06.210> the<00:01:06.390> root<00:01:06.600> give

00:01:07.280 --> 00:01:07.290 
put your straightener in the root give

00:01:07.290 --> 00:01:16.530 
put your straightener in the root give
it<00:01:07.409> a<00:01:07.470> twist<00:01:07.710> and<00:01:08.900> slowly<00:01:09.900> pull<00:01:10.290> out

00:01:16.530 --> 00:01:16.540 

00:01:16.540 --> 00:01:19.150 

now<00:01:17.540> because<00:01:17.810> we've<00:01:17.930> got<00:01:18.110> ceramic<00:01:18.470> Argan

00:01:19.150 --> 00:01:19.160 
now because we've got ceramic Argan

00:01:19.160 --> 00:01:21.610 
now because we've got ceramic Argan
plates<00:01:19.640> on<00:01:19.880> this<00:01:20.060> it's<00:01:20.240> really<00:01:20.630> really<00:01:20.930> smooth

00:01:21.610 --> 00:01:21.620 
plates on this it's really really smooth

00:01:21.620 --> 00:01:24.790 
plates on this it's really really smooth
so<00:01:22.310> you<00:01:22.400> get<00:01:22.520> a<00:01:22.550> really<00:01:22.850> nice<00:01:23.120> even<00:01:23.570> curl<00:01:23.840> twist

00:01:24.790 --> 00:01:24.800 
so you get a really nice even curl twist

00:01:24.800 --> 00:01:27.520 
so you get a really nice even curl twist
it<00:01:24.920> between<00:01:25.160> your<00:01:25.250> finger<00:01:25.580> let<00:01:26.240> it<00:01:26.360> go<00:01:26.540> and

00:01:27.520 --> 00:01:27.530 
it between your finger let it go and

00:01:27.530 --> 00:01:51.010 
it between your finger let it go and
there<00:01:27.740> it<00:01:27.830> is<00:01:49.509> we're<00:01:50.509> going<00:01:50.600> to<00:01:50.690> look<00:01:50.869> at

00:01:51.010 --> 00:01:51.020 
there it is we're going to look at

00:01:51.020 --> 00:01:52.749 
there it is we're going to look at
dressing<00:01:51.500> the<00:01:51.590> hair<00:01:51.770> out<00:01:51.950> and<00:01:52.220> pinning<00:01:52.490> it<00:01:52.610> up

00:01:52.749 --> 00:01:52.759 
dressing the hair out and pinning it up

00:01:52.759 --> 00:01:55.180 
dressing the hair out and pinning it up
now<00:01:52.970> so<00:01:53.900> what<00:01:54.050> we<00:01:54.170> might<00:01:54.320> do<00:01:54.530> ordinarily<00:01:54.979> is

00:01:55.180 --> 00:01:55.190 
now so what we might do ordinarily is

00:01:55.190 --> 00:01:57.219 
now so what we might do ordinarily is
pull<00:01:55.820> these<00:01:56.030> curls<00:01:56.300> out<00:01:56.450> a<00:01:56.509> little<00:01:56.840> bit<00:01:57.020> and

00:01:57.219 --> 00:01:57.229 
pull these curls out a little bit and

00:01:57.229 --> 00:01:59.350 
pull these curls out a little bit and
and<00:01:57.770> pull<00:01:58.190> them<00:01:58.310> out<00:01:58.400> with<00:01:58.490> our<00:01:58.580> fingers<00:01:59.030> and

00:01:59.350 --> 00:01:59.360 
and pull them out with our fingers and

00:01:59.360 --> 00:02:01.540 
and pull them out with our fingers and
get<00:01:59.479> them<00:01:59.600> a<00:01:59.660> little<00:01:59.690> bit<00:01:59.869> more<00:02:00.080> textured<00:02:00.619> but

00:02:01.540 --> 00:02:01.550 
get them a little bit more textured but

00:02:01.550 --> 00:02:02.740 
get them a little bit more textured but
then<00:02:01.670> if<00:02:01.790> we<00:02:01.820> go<00:02:02.030> and<00:02:02.180> do<00:02:02.240> the<00:02:02.330> back<00:02:02.450> combing

00:02:02.740 --> 00:02:02.750 
then if we go and do the back combing

00:02:02.750 --> 00:02:04.359 
then if we go and do the back combing
afterwards<00:02:03.410> what<00:02:03.649> we're<00:02:03.740> going<00:02:03.890> to<00:02:03.920> find<00:02:04.130> is

00:02:04.359 --> 00:02:04.369 
afterwards what we're going to find is

00:02:04.369 --> 00:02:05.650 
afterwards what we're going to find is
we're<00:02:04.490> going<00:02:04.580> to<00:02:04.670> mess<00:02:04.820> up<00:02:04.850> those<00:02:05.090> curls<00:02:05.390> too

00:02:05.650 --> 00:02:05.660 
we're going to mess up those curls too

00:02:05.660 --> 00:02:07.930 
we're going to mess up those curls too
much<00:02:05.869> so<00:02:06.530> it's<00:02:06.649> really<00:02:06.920> important<00:02:07.460> that<00:02:07.580> we<00:02:07.729> do

00:02:07.930 --> 00:02:07.940 
much so it's really important that we do

00:02:07.940 --> 00:02:09.969 
much so it's really important that we do
this<00:02:08.090> back<00:02:08.330> home<00:02:08.540> in<00:02:08.690> at<00:02:08.810> this<00:02:08.989> stage<00:02:09.350> while

00:02:09.969 --> 00:02:09.979 
this back home in at this stage while

00:02:09.979 --> 00:02:11.710 
this back home in at this stage while
the<00:02:10.009> curls<00:02:10.340> are<00:02:10.489> still<00:02:10.700> very<00:02:10.880> very<00:02:11.090> structured

00:02:11.710 --> 00:02:11.720 
the curls are still very very structured

00:02:11.720 --> 00:02:15.100 
the curls are still very very structured
I've<00:02:12.320> taken<00:02:12.530> a<00:02:12.680> triangular<00:02:13.190> section<00:02:13.989> just<00:02:14.989> at

00:02:15.100 --> 00:02:15.110 
I've taken a triangular section just at

00:02:15.110 --> 00:02:19.680 
I've taken a triangular section just at
the<00:02:15.200> crown<00:02:15.970> and<00:02:16.970> I'm<00:02:17.180> going<00:02:17.330> to<00:02:17.390> pin<00:02:17.570> it<00:02:17.690> away

00:02:19.680 --> 00:02:19.690 
the crown and I'm going to pin it away

00:02:19.690 --> 00:02:22.900 
the crown and I'm going to pin it away
just<00:02:20.690> underneath<00:02:21.140> that<00:02:21.350> section<00:02:21.860> is<00:02:22.670> where

00:02:22.900 --> 00:02:22.910 
just underneath that section is where

00:02:22.910 --> 00:02:25.949 
just underneath that section is where
we're<00:02:23.000> going<00:02:23.120> to<00:02:23.180> lift<00:02:23.360> up<00:02:23.510> the<00:02:23.660> section<00:02:24.110> and

00:02:25.949 --> 00:02:25.959 
we're going to lift up the section and

00:02:25.959 --> 00:02:29.259 
we're going to lift up the section and
lightly<00:02:26.959> push<00:02:27.830> the<00:02:28.010> hair<00:02:28.190> down<00:02:28.400> there's<00:02:29.209> a

00:02:29.259 --> 00:02:29.269 
lightly push the hair down there's a

00:02:29.269 --> 00:02:31.180 
lightly push the hair down there's a
really<00:02:29.810> big<00:02:30.049> difference<00:02:30.110> in<00:02:30.799> back<00:02:30.980> combing

00:02:31.180 --> 00:02:31.190 
really big difference in back combing

00:02:31.190 --> 00:02:34.330 
really big difference in back combing
like<00:02:31.489> this<00:02:31.730> only<00:02:32.420> ever<00:02:32.930> creates<00:02:33.350> knots<00:02:33.680> what

00:02:34.330 --> 00:02:34.340 
like this only ever creates knots what

00:02:34.340 --> 00:02:39.190 
like this only ever creates knots what
we<00:02:34.430> want<00:02:34.640> is<00:02:34.820> just<00:02:34.850> to<00:02:35.090> tease<00:02:35.510> the<00:02:35.900> hair<00:02:38.200> into

00:02:39.190 --> 00:02:39.200 
we want is just to tease the hair into

00:02:39.200 --> 00:02:41.320 
we want is just to tease the hair into
that<00:02:39.410> really<00:02:39.680> nice<00:02:39.890> fluffy<00:02:40.280> texture<00:02:40.760> and<00:02:40.940> then

00:02:41.320 --> 00:02:41.330 
that really nice fluffy texture and then

00:02:41.330 --> 00:02:47.830 
that really nice fluffy texture and then
we'll<00:02:41.480> spray<00:02:41.750> it<00:02:41.900> just<00:02:42.140> slightly

00:02:47.830 --> 00:02:47.840 

00:02:47.840 --> 00:02:50.060 

bringing<00:02:48.840> out<00:02:48.960> your<00:02:48.990> next<00:02:49.350> section<00:02:49.800> from<00:02:49.920> the

00:02:50.060 --> 00:02:50.070 
bringing out your next section from the

00:02:50.070 --> 00:02:54.320 
bringing out your next section from the
triangle<00:02:50.720> that<00:02:51.720> was<00:02:51.900> sent<00:02:52.080> to<00:02:52.140> me<00:02:52.290> so<00:02:52.350> I'd<00:02:53.330> put

00:02:54.320 --> 00:02:54.330 
triangle that was sent to me so I'd put

00:02:54.330 --> 00:02:58.700 
triangle that was sent to me so I'd put
it<00:02:54.420> in<00:02:54.570> front<00:02:56.810> holding<00:02:57.810> the<00:02:57.900> whole<00:02:58.110> section<00:02:58.380> up

00:02:58.700 --> 00:02:58.710 
it in front holding the whole section up

00:02:58.710 --> 00:03:07.910 
it in front holding the whole section up
and<00:02:59.810> teasing<00:03:00.810> it<00:03:00.900> back<00:03:06.380> then<00:03:07.380> just<00:03:07.680> on<00:03:07.800> the

00:03:07.910 --> 00:03:07.920 
and teasing it back then just on the

00:03:07.920 --> 00:03:10.340 
and teasing it back then just on the
side<00:03:08.160> sections<00:03:08.790> not<00:03:09.480> as<00:03:09.570> intensely<00:03:10.050> as<00:03:10.110> I've

00:03:10.340 --> 00:03:10.350 
side sections not as intensely as I've

00:03:10.350 --> 00:03:12.380 
side sections not as intensely as I've
done<00:03:10.530> around<00:03:10.620> the<00:03:10.860> crown<00:03:11.100> I'm<00:03:11.490> going<00:03:12.090> to<00:03:12.180> hold

00:03:12.380 --> 00:03:12.390 
done around the crown I'm going to hold

00:03:12.390 --> 00:03:14.510 
done around the crown I'm going to hold
some<00:03:12.600> vertical<00:03:12.930> sections<00:03:13.440> out<00:03:13.650> and<00:03:14.010> tease

00:03:14.510 --> 00:03:14.520 
some vertical sections out and tease

00:03:14.520 --> 00:03:27.260 
some vertical sections out and tease
them<00:03:14.550> back<00:03:24.500> so<00:03:25.500> vertical<00:03:25.740> sections<00:03:26.550> working

00:03:27.260 --> 00:03:27.270 
them back so vertical sections working

00:03:27.270 --> 00:03:31.220 
them back so vertical sections working
from<00:03:27.540> the<00:03:27.630> top<00:03:27.780> of<00:03:27.840> the<00:03:27.900> parting<00:03:30.110> pull<00:03:31.110> them

00:03:31.220 --> 00:03:31.230 
from the top of the parting pull them

00:03:31.230 --> 00:03:33.710 
from the top of the parting pull them
straight<00:03:31.860> out<00:03:32.040> and<00:03:33.030> just<00:03:33.210> tease<00:03:33.480> them

00:03:33.710 --> 00:03:33.720 
straight out and just tease them

00:03:33.720 --> 00:03:41.930 
straight out and just tease them
backwards<00:03:40.100> what<00:03:41.100> you<00:03:41.190> can<00:03:41.340> see<00:03:41.610> from<00:03:41.820> what

00:03:41.930 --> 00:03:41.940 
backwards what you can see from what

00:03:41.940 --> 00:03:43.190 
backwards what you can see from what
we've<00:03:42.060> done<00:03:42.210> on<00:03:42.330> the<00:03:42.420> back<00:03:42.570> comb<00:03:42.840> is<00:03:43.050> that

00:03:43.190 --> 00:03:43.200 
we've done on the back comb is that

00:03:43.200 --> 00:03:46.070 
we've done on the back comb is that
already<00:03:43.680> it's<00:03:43.950> been<00:03:44.010> began<00:03:44.790> to<00:03:45.030> to<00:03:45.150> shovel<00:03:45.540> the

00:03:46.070 --> 00:03:46.080 
already it's been began to to shovel the

00:03:46.080 --> 00:03:47.570 
already it's been began to to shovel the
curls<00:03:46.350> and<00:03:46.650> that's<00:03:46.830> the<00:03:46.950> reason<00:03:47.220> why<00:03:47.310> we<00:03:47.490> don't

00:03:47.570 --> 00:03:47.580 
curls and that's the reason why we don't

00:03:47.580 --> 00:03:52.670 
curls and that's the reason why we don't
do<00:03:47.820> that<00:03:48.000> at<00:03:48.090> the<00:03:48.180> start<00:03:51.260> release<00:03:52.260> the<00:03:52.470> top

00:03:52.670 --> 00:03:52.680 
do that at the start release the top

00:03:52.680 --> 00:03:54.440 
do that at the start release the top
just<00:03:52.980> a<00:03:53.010> little<00:03:53.220> bit<00:03:53.370> we're<00:03:54.000> gonna<00:03:54.090> keep<00:03:54.270> this

00:03:54.440 --> 00:03:54.450 
just a little bit we're gonna keep this

00:03:54.450 --> 00:04:01.150 
just a little bit we're gonna keep this
really<00:03:54.840> messy<00:03:55.260> really<00:03:55.470> carefree<00:03:56.430> really<00:03:57.390> easy

00:04:01.150 --> 00:04:01.160 

00:04:01.160 --> 00:04:04.010 

and<00:04:02.160> we're<00:04:02.370> going<00:04:02.490> to<00:04:02.520> just<00:04:02.670> twist<00:04:03.060> the<00:04:03.840> hair

00:04:04.010 --> 00:04:04.020 
and we're going to just twist the hair

00:04:04.020 --> 00:04:09.290 
and we're going to just twist the hair
back<00:04:04.230> onto<00:04:04.710> itself<00:04:07.070> I'm<00:04:08.070> purposely<00:04:08.640> combing

00:04:09.290 --> 00:04:09.300 
back onto itself I'm purposely combing

00:04:09.300 --> 00:04:11.120 
back onto itself I'm purposely combing
this<00:04:09.420> with<00:04:09.570> my<00:04:09.720> fingers<00:04:10.080> because<00:04:10.230> I<00:04:10.620> don't

00:04:11.120 --> 00:04:11.130 
this with my fingers because I don't

00:04:11.130 --> 00:04:19.910 
this with my fingers because I don't
want<00:04:11.340> it<00:04:11.490> to<00:04:11.640> look<00:04:11.850> too<00:04:13.940> hard<00:04:18.440> using<00:04:19.440> a<00:04:19.650> pin

00:04:19.910 --> 00:04:19.920 
want it to look too hard using a pin

00:04:19.920 --> 00:04:24.290 
want it to look too hard using a pin
just<00:04:20.160> to<00:04:20.280> secure<00:04:20.670> it<00:04:20.760> in<00:04:22.190> and<00:04:23.190> repeat<00:04:23.940> on<00:04:24.150> the

00:04:24.290 --> 00:04:24.300 
just to secure it in and repeat on the

00:04:24.300 --> 00:04:26.600 
just to secure it in and repeat on the
other<00:04:24.330> side<00:04:24.830> and<00:04:25.830> what<00:04:26.010> you<00:04:26.100> do<00:04:26.190> need<00:04:26.340> to<00:04:26.460> just

00:04:26.600 --> 00:04:26.610 
other side and what you do need to just

00:04:26.610 --> 00:04:28.640 
other side and what you do need to just
overlapping<00:04:27.360> that<00:04:27.720> section<00:04:28.230> on<00:04:28.320> to<00:04:28.440> the<00:04:28.530> other

00:04:28.640 --> 00:04:28.650 
overlapping that section on to the other

00:04:28.650 --> 00:04:38.670 
overlapping that section on to the other
side<00:04:28.920> so<00:04:29.550> you<00:04:29.640> get<00:04:29.760> a<00:04:29.820> really<00:04:30.150> nice<00:04:30.540> twist

00:04:38.670 --> 00:04:38.680 

00:04:38.680 --> 00:04:41.910 

just<00:04:39.680> tweaking<00:04:40.130> it<00:04:40.220> slightly<00:04:40.460> at<00:04:40.670> the<00:04:40.760> top

00:04:41.910 --> 00:04:41.920 
just tweaking it slightly at the top

00:04:41.920 --> 00:04:45.820 
just tweaking it slightly at the top
just<00:04:42.920> to<00:04:43.100> make<00:04:43.250> sure<00:04:43.460> it's<00:04:43.760> all<00:04:43.910> even<00:04:44.740> and<00:04:45.740> we

00:04:45.820 --> 00:04:45.830 
just to make sure it's all even and we

00:04:45.830 --> 00:04:46.930 
just to make sure it's all even and we
could<00:04:45.950> actually<00:04:46.040> even<00:04:46.430> leave<00:04:46.580> it<00:04:46.760> like<00:04:46.910> that

00:04:46.930 --> 00:04:46.940 
could actually even leave it like that

00:04:46.940 --> 00:04:50.340 
could actually even leave it like that
this<00:04:47.840> was<00:04:47.990> a<00:04:48.020> really<00:04:48.380> nice<00:04:48.530> half-up<00:04:49.490> half-down

00:04:50.340 --> 00:04:50.350 
this was a really nice half-up half-down

00:04:50.350 --> 00:04:52.450 
this was a really nice half-up half-down
but<00:04:51.350> we<00:04:51.470> might<00:04:51.620> just<00:04:51.800> take<00:04:51.950> it<00:04:52.100> one<00:04:52.220> step

00:04:52.450 --> 00:04:52.460 
but we might just take it one step

00:04:52.460 --> 00:04:57.760 
but we might just take it one step
further<00:04:56.140> we're<00:04:57.140> going<00:04:57.260> to<00:04:57.320> look<00:04:57.410> at<00:04:57.470> taking

00:04:57.760 --> 00:04:57.770 
further we're going to look at taking

00:04:57.770 --> 00:05:02.910 
further we're going to look at taking
the<00:04:57.860> whole<00:04:58.130> section<00:04:59.860> as<00:05:00.860> messy<00:05:01.550> as<00:05:01.670> it<00:05:01.700> is

00:05:02.910 --> 00:05:02.920 
the whole section as messy as it is

00:05:02.920 --> 00:05:05.860 
the whole section as messy as it is
holding<00:05:03.920> it<00:05:04.010> up<00:05:04.160> and<00:05:04.430> just<00:05:05.330> gripping<00:05:05.780> it

00:05:05.860 --> 00:05:05.870 
holding it up and just gripping it

00:05:05.870 --> 00:05:17.200 
holding it up and just gripping it
wherever<00:05:06.080> is<00:05:06.650> available<00:05:15.460> the<00:05:16.460> last<00:05:16.700> thing<00:05:17.090> you

wherever is available the last thing you

00:05:17.210 --> 00:05:19.420 
wherever is available the last thing you
want<00:05:17.360> to<00:05:17.480> do<00:05:17.630> just<00:05:17.660> to<00:05:17.990> make<00:05:18.020> sure<00:05:18.290> that<00:05:18.440> you<00:05:19.250> do

00:05:19.420 --> 00:05:19.430 
want to do just to make sure that you do

00:05:19.430 --> 00:05:22.060 
want to do just to make sure that you do
get<00:05:19.700> it<00:05:19.820> even<00:05:20.470> even<00:05:21.470> if<00:05:21.560> we<00:05:21.650> want<00:05:21.800> it<00:05:21.860> quite

00:05:22.060 --> 00:05:22.070 
get it even even if we want it quite

00:05:22.070 --> 00:05:24.280 
get it even even if we want it quite
messy<00:05:22.460> again<00:05:23.030> just<00:05:23.390> spray<00:05:23.570> on<00:05:23.600> your<00:05:23.780> hands<00:05:24.020> and

00:05:24.290 --> 00:05:27.940 
messy again just spray on your hands and
hold<00:05:24.560> it<00:05:24.770> upright<00:05:26.410> and<00:05:27.410> when<00:05:27.530> you<00:05:27.650> let<00:05:27.830> your
