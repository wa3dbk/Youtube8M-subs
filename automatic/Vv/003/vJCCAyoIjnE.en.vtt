00:01:20.189 --> 00:01:25.170
 nevian exactly what you can have but i 

00:01:22.380 --> 00:01:26.580
 for example 10 l dl mail gmail mail 

00:01:25.170 --> 00:01:27.479
 drive on it at work for example 

00:01:26.580 --> 00:01:29.549
 mail.ru 

00:01:27.479 --> 00:01:30.780
 not working here there are people sting that with 

00:01:29.549 --> 00:01:31.650
 mail.ru I read they can 

00:01:30.780 --> 00:01:34.320
 to register 

00:01:31.650 --> 00:01:36.000
 therefore it is desirable that you have 

00:01:34.320 --> 00:01:38.159
 mail dzhimayl perhaps some other 

00:01:36.000 --> 00:01:38.670
 fit in touch and say exactly this 

00:01:38.159 --> 00:01:41.340
 I can not 

00:01:38.670 --> 00:01:43.200
 here then the password you choose 10 then 

00:01:41.340 --> 00:01:44.490
 confirm and password enter again this 

00:01:43.200 --> 00:01:46.259
 I do not need something and here it is 

00:01:44.490 --> 00:01:46.860
 The problem many have the lowest 

00:01:46.259 --> 00:01:48.720
 paragraph 

00:01:46.860 --> 00:01:50.280
 in the form of nargiz cracks that is 

00:01:48.720 --> 00:01:51.420
 confirmation of the registration of the guys here 

00:01:50.280 --> 00:01:54.509
 written following 

00:01:51.420 --> 00:01:57.479
 sang the robot so the bridge meaning it means 

00:01:54.509 --> 00:02:01.110
 such a literal translation of this phrase is necessary 

00:01:57.479 --> 00:02:02.830
 say the word robot robot backwards 

00:02:01.110 --> 00:02:04.690
 in advance 

00:02:02.830 --> 00:02:06.790
 there is already below the vodka site it is written that 

00:02:04.690 --> 00:02:09.280
 this is a bot check what does it mean 

00:02:06.790 --> 00:02:11.740
 guys write a word or pronounce 

00:02:09.280 --> 00:02:13.510
 the word robot on the front and what did say 

00:02:11.740 --> 00:02:16.960
 It means that is, roughly speaking, we take 

00:02:13.510 --> 00:02:20.710
 the words of the robot and write it will pick up the raid 

00:02:16.960 --> 00:02:22.110
 get us camp see here thio about 

00:02:20.710 --> 00:02:26.560
 her ad 

00:02:22.110 --> 00:02:28.270
 robot ax and again just spelled 

00:02:26.560 --> 00:02:30.640
 go ahead and I don't know why they did it 

00:02:28.270 --> 00:02:32.410
 honestly when i started when registering on 

00:02:30.640 --> 00:02:34.480
 this site, I also a little bit for the bonus 

00:02:32.410 --> 00:02:36.670
 because at least we could 

00:02:34.480 --> 00:02:39.820
 would highlight the word robot at least not blowing 

00:02:36.670 --> 00:02:41.590
 I know someone quotes to understand you can 

00:02:39.820 --> 00:02:43.480
 it was immediately what exactly this word is needed 

00:02:41.590 --> 00:02:46.270
 to pronounce for the period you need a little bit of us 

00:02:43.480 --> 00:02:49.090
 visible and so people do not understand what to 

00:02:46.270 --> 00:02:51.100
 what and and also he even become guys what have 

00:02:49.090 --> 00:02:53.170
 you instead of the word robot in here can 

00:02:51.100 --> 00:02:55.060
 be any other word absolutely any 

00:02:53.170 --> 00:02:58.720
 Mostly people say that here either 

00:02:55.060 --> 00:03:02.080
 the robot is either a fleamer or fate can 

00:02:58.720 --> 00:03:04.900
 don't even know you 22 2101 for example 

00:03:02.080 --> 00:03:07.420
 written to be either a wall or pikachu 

00:03:04.900 --> 00:03:09.550
 some kind that was not written here 

00:03:07.420 --> 00:03:10.750
 for example if the frame is written here 

00:03:09.550 --> 00:03:12.190
 it is written here for example the trainer yes 

00:03:10.750 --> 00:03:15.180
 imagine that this is written here 

00:03:12.190 --> 00:03:18.040
 here are the places the robot you write 

00:03:15.180 --> 00:03:21.879
 rap 

00:03:18.040 --> 00:03:22.359
 rf mars ie places free world in caves 

00:03:21.879 --> 00:03:24.879
 Mars 

00:03:22.359 --> 00:03:26.920
 after all here you have an input tremor instead 

00:03:24.879 --> 00:03:27.939
 primer and press submit that is 

00:03:26.920 --> 00:03:30.370
 to register 

00:03:27.939 --> 00:03:31.989
 that is, you sort of understood to the place of the robot 

00:03:30.370 --> 00:03:35.349
 you can have any other word 

00:03:31.989 --> 00:03:36.099
 which should write the opposite 

00:03:35.349 --> 00:03:37.659
 vice versa 

00:03:36.099 --> 00:03:42.069
 and write here is nothing complicated absolutely 

00:03:37.659 --> 00:03:43.810
 no it's very simple if you make a mistake and 

00:03:42.069 --> 00:03:46.720
 something here is wrong wrote cut the 

00:03:43.810 --> 00:03:49.569
 book missed do not know wrote a robot 

00:03:46.720 --> 00:03:51.310
 not the other way around like there is a robot when you have 

00:03:49.569 --> 00:03:52.900
 It is written that you are not like portions 

00:03:51.310 --> 00:03:54.639
 be able to register what is 

00:03:52.900 --> 00:03:58.359
 experience is written you are no different 

00:03:54.639 --> 00:03:59.760
 refresh the page again and stay and i 

00:03:58.359 --> 00:04:01.870
 register again 

00:03:59.760 --> 00:04:03.970
 blah blah blah some sort of nonsense falls to me 

00:04:01.870 --> 00:04:05.620
 it doesn't matter refresh the page and 

00:04:03.970 --> 00:04:07.510
 try to register again here and 

00:04:05.620 --> 00:04:10.540
 all and all speak and everything is very simple and 

00:04:07.510 --> 00:04:12.970
 all in court and there are no problems go 

00:04:10.540 --> 00:04:14.590

00:04:34.720 --> 00:04:38.349
 friends that is, you can each other 

00:04:36.550 --> 00:04:40.659
 find this needling such an opportunity 

00:04:38.349 --> 00:04:44.979
 provides so that and to play again 

00:04:40.659 --> 00:04:47.590
 same with the Russian-speaking people and do not bathe 

00:04:44.979 --> 00:04:50.409

 each has its own videos how to play 

00:04:52.060 --> 00:04:57.340
 separate role yes and you're already using 

00:04:55.240 --> 00:04:59.040
 This data is about how to play each role. 

00:04:57.340 --> 00:05:02.190
 will be already in Russian 

00:04:59.040 --> 00:05:05.130
 to cheat a friend to write to negotiate 

00:05:02.190 --> 00:05:06.540
 gossip intrigue build chapter 

00:05:05.130 --> 00:05:09.000
 gross shorter cool 

00:05:06.540 --> 00:05:10.680
 will probably finish this all 

00:05:09.000 --> 00:05:12.210
 Thank you very much for your attention if someone 

00:05:10.680 --> 00:05:13.880

 turning a roller doesnâ€™t mean experience 

00:05:13.880 --> 00:05:22.080
 per day which is not under this video I became 

00:05:16.620 --> 00:05:24.510
 would link to the playlist of all this all 

00:05:22.080 --> 00:05:26.820

00:05:26.820 --> 00:05:30.660
 it's just one of 

00:05:28.290 --> 00:05:33.360
 I know one of the grandest steep 

00:05:30.660 --> 00:05:35.790
