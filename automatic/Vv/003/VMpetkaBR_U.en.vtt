00:01:37.740 --> 00:01:39.679 
it going to get much stronger could but
I<00:01:37.799> mean<00:01:37.950> again<00:01:38.220> everything<00:01:38.970> we<00:01:39.060> know<00:01:39.329> that

00:01:39.679 --> 00:01:39.689 
I mean again everything we know that

00:01:39.689 --> 00:01:41.690 
I mean again everything we know that
could<00:01:39.810> drive<00:01:40.079> the<00:01:40.320> price<00:01:40.619> of<00:01:40.979> gold<00:01:41.280> lower<00:01:41.549> is

00:01:41.690 --> 00:01:41.700 
could drive the price of gold lower is

00:01:41.700 --> 00:01:43.520 
could drive the price of gold lower is
basically<00:01:42.119> priced<00:01:42.450> into<00:01:42.630> the<00:01:42.689> market<00:01:42.780> so

00:01:43.520 --> 00:01:43.530 
basically priced into the market so

00:01:43.530 --> 00:01:45.230 
basically priced into the market so
could<00:01:43.740> it<00:01:43.770> go<00:01:43.890> low<00:01:44.040> sure<00:01:44.310> but<00:01:44.759> I<00:01:44.790> think<00:01:44.850> this<00:01:45.180> is

00:01:45.230 --> 00:01:45.240 
could it go low sure but I think this is

00:01:45.240 --> 00:01:47.480 
could it go low sure but I think this is
a<00:01:45.329> great<00:01:45.720> spot<00:01:46.020> as<00:01:46.259> a<00:01:46.290> hard<00:01:46.649> asset<00:01:46.860> that<00:01:47.100> people

00:01:47.480 --> 00:01:47.490 
a great spot as a hard asset that people

00:01:47.490 --> 00:01:49.789 
a great spot as a hard asset that people
should<00:01:47.759> own<00:01:47.939> at<00:01:48.450> these<00:01:48.750> levels<00:01:48.990> at<00:01:49.320> least<00:01:49.560> a

00:01:49.789 --> 00:01:49.799 
should own at these levels at least a

00:01:49.799 --> 00:01:51.230 
should own at these levels at least a
portion<00:01:50.100> of<00:01:50.340> your<00:01:50.460> portfolio<00:01:50.640> should<00:01:51.119> be

00:01:51.230 --> 00:01:51.240 
portion of your portfolio should be

00:01:51.240 --> 00:01:52.550 
portion of your portfolio should be
involved<00:01:51.479> in<00:01:51.750> gold<00:01:51.960> right<00:01:52.140> now<00:01:52.259> all<00:01:52.409> right

00:01:52.550 --> 00:01:52.560 
involved in gold right now all right

00:01:52.560 --> 00:01:54.289 
involved in gold right now all right
what<00:01:52.710> about<00:01:52.740> oil<00:01:53.250> down<00:01:53.610> for<00:01:53.970> the<00:01:54.060> fifth

00:01:54.289 --> 00:01:54.299 
what about oil down for the fifth

00:01:54.299 --> 00:01:56.899 
what about oil down for the fifth
straight<00:01:54.720> day<00:01:54.780> here<00:01:55.680> where's<00:01:56.340> the<00:01:56.490> bottom<00:01:56.759> for

00:01:56.899 --> 00:01:56.909 
straight day here where's the bottom for

00:01:56.909 --> 00:01:58.219 
straight day here where's the bottom for
oil<00:01:57.060> here<00:01:57.329> I<00:01:57.509> think<00:01:57.930> we're<00:01:58.049> probably

00:01:58.219 --> 00:01:58.229 
oil here I think we're probably

00:01:58.229 --> 00:02:00.050 
oil here I think we're probably
somewhere<00:01:58.799> around<00:01:58.860> 50<00:01:59.460> you<00:01:59.579> know<00:01:59.700> again

00:02:00.050 --> 00:02:00.060 
somewhere around 50 you know again

00:02:00.060 --> 00:02:01.490 
somewhere around 50 you know again
you've<00:02:00.299> got<00:02:00.329> you<00:02:00.750> had<00:02:00.869> a<00:02:00.899> lot<00:02:01.020> of<00:02:01.079> manipulation

00:02:01.490 --> 00:02:01.500 
you've got you had a lot of manipulation

00:02:01.500 --> 00:02:03.800 
you've got you had a lot of manipulation
in<00:02:02.040> the<00:02:02.250> oil<00:02:02.430> markets<00:02:02.490> as<00:02:02.909> well<00:02:02.939> you've<00:02:03.600> got

00:02:03.800 --> 00:02:03.810 
in the oil markets as well you've got

00:02:03.810 --> 00:02:05.630 
in the oil markets as well you've got
the<00:02:03.930> same<00:02:04.140> issue<00:02:04.350> of<00:02:04.500> the<00:02:04.560> strong<00:02:04.829> dollar<00:02:04.860> you

00:02:05.630 --> 00:02:05.640 
the same issue of the strong dollar you

00:02:05.640 --> 00:02:07.639 
the same issue of the strong dollar you
had<00:02:05.820> Citigroup<00:02:06.630> and<00:02:06.750> Goldman<00:02:06.840> Sachs<00:02:07.380> calling

00:02:07.639 --> 00:02:07.649 
had Citigroup and Goldman Sachs calling

00:02:07.649 --> 00:02:09.680 
had Citigroup and Goldman Sachs calling
for<00:02:07.770> twenty<00:02:08.069> dollar<00:02:08.250> oil<00:02:08.580> as<00:02:08.849> it<00:02:08.910> was<00:02:09.360> going<00:02:09.569> to

00:02:09.680 --> 00:02:09.690 
for twenty dollar oil as it was going to

00:02:09.690 --> 00:02:12.229 
for twenty dollar oil as it was going to
65<00:02:10.289> so<00:02:10.950> now<00:02:11.099> maybe<00:02:11.310> they<00:02:11.550> got<00:02:11.640> into<00:02:11.790> wish<00:02:12.000> I

00:02:12.229 --> 00:02:12.239 
65 so now maybe they got into wish I

00:02:12.239 --> 00:02:13.130 
65 so now maybe they got into wish I
don't<00:02:12.480> think<00:02:12.660> so<00:02:12.780> I<00:02:12.840> think

00:02:13.130 --> 00:02:13.140 
don't think so I think

00:02:13.140 --> 00:02:14.540

00:02:14.540 --> 00:02:14.550 
were coming down here to a pretty key

00:02:14.550 --> 00:02:17.210 
were coming down here to a pretty key
level<00:02:14.910> Iran<00:02:15.690> has<00:02:15.720> nothing<00:02:16.319> to<00:02:16.410> do<00:02:16.950> with<00:02:17.130> this

00:02:17.210 --> 00:02:17.220
