Rudd<00:02:16.390> head<00:02:16.629> sculpt<00:02:17.080> I<00:02:17.170> really<00:02:17.409> think<00:02:17.560> they<00:02:17.650> did

00:02:17.789 --> 00:02:17.799 
Rudd head sculpt I really think they did

00:02:17.799 --> 00:02:19.559 
Rudd head sculpt I really think they did
capture<00:02:18.189> the<00:02:18.310> likeness<00:02:18.459> of<00:02:18.760> Paul<00:02:19.030> Rudd<00:02:19.269> over

00:02:19.559 --> 00:02:19.569 
capture the likeness of Paul Rudd over

00:02:19.569 --> 00:02:21.000 
capture the likeness of Paul Rudd over
here<00:02:19.810> you<00:02:20.049> know<00:02:20.170> get<00:02:20.530> his<00:02:20.650> facial<00:02:20.860> features

00:02:21.000 --> 00:02:21.010

here you know get his facial features
and<00:02:21.519> everything<00:02:21.909> I<00:02:22.060> think<00:02:22.239> the<00:02:22.390> paint<00:02:22.659> gets<00:02:22.840> a

00:02:22.979 --> 00:02:22.989 
and everything I think the paint gets a

00:02:22.989 --> 00:02:24.509 
and everything I think the paint gets a
little<00:02:23.290> bit<00:02:23.409> weird<00:02:23.590> especially<00:02:24.010> in<00:02:24.129> that<00:02:24.220> ear

00:02:24.509 --> 00:02:24.519 
little bit weird especially in that ear

00:02:24.519 --> 00:02:26.580

looks good and it's a nice sculpt but

00:02:33.430 --> 00:02:34.470

00:02:41.610 --> 00:02:41.620 
which looks a little bit strange but I

00:02:41.620 --> 00:02:43.289 
which looks a little bit strange but I
do<00:02:41.709> like<00:02:41.950> the<00:02:42.129> five<00:02:42.310> o'clock<00:02:42.430> shadow<00:02:42.610> paint

there's<00:02:46.000> like<00:02:46.180> these<00:02:46.330> little<00:02:46.629> fabric<00:02:46.959> flakes

00:02:47.550 --> 00:02:47.560

or something like that stuck in the
paint<00:02:49.390> I<00:02:49.659> noticed<00:02:50.170> that<00:02:50.319> a<00:02:50.349> little<00:02:50.590> bit<00:02:50.680> around

00:02:50.820 --> 00:02:50.830

here<00:02:51.069> on<00:02:51.160> the<00:02:51.190> forehead<00:02:51.489> it's<00:02:51.730> very<00:02:52.030> very<00:02:52.269> hard

here on the forehead it's very very hard
to<00:02:52.629> see<00:02:52.750> but<00:02:53.110> when<00:02:53.200> you<00:02:53.260> have<00:02:53.379> it<00:02:53.500> in<00:02:53.590> person<00:02:53.950> it

00:02:54.089 --> 00:02:54.099 
to see but when you have it in person it

00:02:54.099 --> 00:02:55.140 
to see but when you have it in person it
looks<00:02:54.129> like<00:02:54.430> there's<00:02:54.610> something<00:02:54.879> underneath

00:02:55.140 --> 00:02:55.150 
looks like there's something underneath

00:02:55.150 --> 00:02:57.809 
looks like there's something underneath
the<00:02:55.360> skin<00:02:55.660> and<00:02:56.230> it<00:02:56.560> bothers<00:02:56.980> me<00:02:57.010> but<00:02:57.400> it's<00:02:57.640> not

00:02:57.809 --> 00:02:57.819 
the skin and it bothers me but it's not

00:02:57.819 --> 00:02:59.339 
the skin and it bothers me but it's not
terrible<00:02:58.360> and<00:02:58.540> I<00:02:58.599> think<00:02:58.660> diamond<00:02:59.200> did<00:02:59.319> a

00:02:59.339 --> 00:02:59.349 
terrible and I think diamond did a

00:02:59.349 --> 00:03:01.380 
terrible and I think diamond did a
fantastic<00:02:59.620> job<00:03:00.190> on<00:03:00.549> this<00:03:00.640> Ant<00:03:00.910> Man<00:03:01.030> helmet

how<00:03:03.790> the<00:03:03.849> eyes<00:03:04.060> came<00:03:04.390> out<00:03:04.569> much<00:03:04.959> more<00:03:05.110> film

00:03:05.369 --> 00:03:05.379 
how the eyes came out much more film

00:03:05.379 --> 00:03:06.720 
how the eyes came out much more film
accurate<00:03:05.769> than<00:03:05.890> the<00:03:05.950> legends<00:03:06.310> version<00:03:06.640> I

00:03:06.720 --> 00:03:06.730 
accurate than the legends version I

00:03:06.730 --> 00:03:08.369 
accurate than the legends version I
mentioned<00:03:07.060> that<00:03:07.120> earlier<00:03:07.329> I<00:03:07.780> liked<00:03:08.170> all<00:03:08.290> these

00:03:08.369 --> 00:03:08.379 
mentioned that earlier I liked all these

mentioned that earlier I liked all these
little<00:03:08.590> sculpted<00:03:09.069> pieces<00:03:09.519> think<00:03:09.910> it's

00:03:10.020 --> 00:03:10.030 
little sculpted pieces think it's

00:03:10.030 --> 00:03:12.390 
little sculpted pieces think it's
painted<00:03:10.480> okay<00:03:10.959> that's<00:03:11.560> one<00:03:11.739> gripe<00:03:11.950> of<00:03:11.980> mine<00:03:12.250> is

00:03:12.390 --> 00:03:12.400 
painted okay that's one gripe of mine is

00:03:12.400 --> 00:03:13.979 
painted okay that's one gripe of mine is
that<00:03:12.430> I<00:03:12.609> don't<00:03:12.730> like<00:03:12.940> the<00:03:13.180> silver<00:03:13.569> color<00:03:13.780> that

00:03:13.979 --> 00:03:13.989 
that I don't like the silver color that

00:03:13.989 --> 00:03:16.289 
that I don't like the silver color that
they<00:03:14.140> chose<00:03:14.379> here<00:03:14.709> it's<00:03:15.190> so<00:03:15.430> bright<00:03:15.879> that<00:03:15.910> it

00:03:16.289 --> 00:03:16.299 
they chose here it's so bright that it

00:03:16.299 --> 00:03:18.210 
they chose here it's so bright that it
looks<00:03:16.660> a<00:03:16.780> little<00:03:16.989> bit<00:03:17.079> more<00:03:17.260> like<00:03:17.590> white<00:03:17.920> from

00:03:18.210 --> 00:03:18.220 
looks a little bit more like white from

00:03:18.220 --> 00:03:19.500 
looks a little bit more like white from
a<00:03:18.310> distance<00:03:18.790> and<00:03:18.970> it's<00:03:19.090> not<00:03:19.209> a<00:03:19.239> very

00:03:19.500 --> 00:03:19.510 
a distance and it's not a very

00:03:19.510 --> 00:03:21.509 
a distance and it's not a very
reflective<00:03:19.840> kind<00:03:20.290> of<00:03:20.410> silver<00:03:20.739> color<00:03:20.950> I<00:03:21.190> do

00:03:21.509 --> 00:03:21.519 
reflective kind of silver color I do

00:03:21.519 --> 00:03:23.369 
reflective kind of silver color I do
like<00:03:21.970> this<00:03:22.209> silver<00:03:22.510> color<00:03:22.780> that<00:03:23.019> we<00:03:23.109> got<00:03:23.260> on

00:03:23.369 --> 00:03:23.379 
like this silver color that we got on

00:03:23.379 --> 00:03:24.960 
like this silver color that we got on
the<00:03:23.470> legends<00:03:23.799> version<00:03:24.190> this<00:03:24.430> kind<00:03:24.760> of<00:03:24.790> has<00:03:24.940> a

00:03:24.960 --> 00:03:24.970 
the legends version this kind of has a

00:03:24.970 --> 00:03:26.610 
the legends version this kind of has a
little<00:03:25.120> bit<00:03:25.420> more<00:03:25.480> of<00:03:25.690> a<00:03:25.750> chrome<00:03:26.079> kind<00:03:26.379> of<00:03:26.470> look

00:03:26.610 --> 00:03:26.620 
little bit more of a chrome kind of look

00:03:26.620 --> 00:03:28.020 
little bit more of a chrome kind of look
this<00:03:26.769> reminds<00:03:27.220> me<00:03:27.340> of<00:03:27.430> what<00:03:27.549> we<00:03:27.609> saw<00:03:27.849> in<00:03:27.879> the

00:03:28.020 --> 00:03:28.030 
this reminds me of what we saw in the

00:03:28.030 --> 00:03:29.460 
this reminds me of what we saw in the
movie<00:03:28.150> little<00:03:28.420> bit<00:03:28.510> more<00:03:28.690> as<00:03:29.140> you<00:03:29.230> can<00:03:29.349> see

00:03:29.460 --> 00:03:29.470

00:03:32.220 --> 00:03:32.230 
right there but as you can see it's

00:03:32.230 --> 00:03:33.690

00:03:33.690 --> 00:03:33.700 
totally incorrect with having the face

00:03:33.700 --> 00:03:34.949 
totally incorrect with having the face
showing<00:03:34.120> right<00:03:34.269> over<00:03:34.480> there<00:03:34.660> where<00:03:34.840> this

one's got it all covered up like how it

00:03:36.549 --> 00:03:38.369 
one's got it all covered up like how it
was<00:03:36.700> in<00:03:36.849> the<00:03:36.910> movie<00:03:37.060> but<00:03:37.780> yeah<00:03:37.959> looking<00:03:38.260> at

00:03:38.369 --> 00:03:38.379 
was in the movie but yeah looking at

00:03:38.379 --> 00:03:39.750

this little stain right here I like that

00:03:39.760 --> 00:03:41.670 
this little stain right here I like that
it's<00:03:40.239> just<00:03:40.299> that<00:03:40.450> color<00:03:40.750> choice<00:03:41.049> just<00:03:41.349> bothers

00:03:41.670 --> 00:03:41.680 
it's just that color choice just bothers

00:03:41.680 --> 00:03:43.319 
it's just that color choice just bothers
me<00:03:41.799> a<00:03:41.829> little<00:03:41.980> bit<00:03:42.130> now<00:03:42.760> looking<00:03:43.030> on<00:03:43.090> the<00:03:43.209> back

00:03:43.319 --> 00:03:43.329 
me a little bit now looking on the back

00:03:43.329 --> 00:03:44.849 
me a little bit now looking on the back
over<00:03:43.540> here<00:03:43.630> you<00:03:43.780> get<00:03:43.930> these<00:03:44.049> little<00:03:44.319> tubes<00:03:44.590> and

00:03:44.849 --> 00:03:44.859 
over here you get these little tubes and

00:03:44.859 --> 00:03:46.500 
over here you get these little tubes and
there's<00:03:45.370> these<00:03:45.519> little<00:03:45.730> holes<00:03:46.060> right<00:03:46.299> over

00:03:46.500 --> 00:03:46.510 
there's these little holes right over

00:03:46.510 --> 00:03:47.640 
there's these little holes right over
here<00:03:46.690> that<00:03:46.840> they're<00:03:46.930> supposed<00:03:47.200> to<00:03:47.230> plug<00:03:47.470> into

00:03:47.640 --> 00:03:47.650 
here that they're supposed to plug into

00:03:47.650 --> 00:03:49.650 
here that they're supposed to plug into
these<00:03:48.400> weren't<00:03:48.609> plugged<00:03:48.910> in<00:03:49.030> when<00:03:49.180> I<00:03:49.209> opened

00:03:49.650 --> 00:03:49.660 
these weren't plugged in when I opened

00:03:49.660 --> 00:03:51.449 
these weren't plugged in when I opened
this<00:03:49.840> you<00:03:50.349> can<00:03:50.500> put<00:03:50.769> them<00:03:50.859> in<00:03:50.980> there<00:03:51.069> but<00:03:51.310> it's

00:03:51.449 --> 00:03:51.459 
this you can put them in there but it's

00:03:51.459 --> 00:03:52.770 
this you can put them in there but it's
going<00:03:51.549> to<00:03:51.639> fall<00:03:51.910> out<00:03:51.940> as<00:03:52.239> soon<00:03:52.389> as<00:03:52.450> you<00:03:52.540> start

00:03:52.770 --> 00:03:52.780 
going to fall out as soon as you start

00:03:52.780 --> 00:03:54.900 
going to fall out as soon as you start
articulating<00:03:53.500> it<00:03:53.620> so<00:03:53.829> I<00:03:53.859> guess<00:03:54.250> I<00:03:54.400> could<00:03:54.700> try

00:03:54.900 --> 00:03:54.910 
articulating it so I guess I could try

00:03:54.910 --> 00:03:57.360 
articulating it so I guess I could try
supergluing<00:03:55.450> those<00:03:55.690> in<00:03:55.930> there<00:03:56.139> but<00:03:56.829> no<00:03:57.099> no<00:03:57.340> I

00:03:57.360 --> 00:03:57.370 
supergluing those in there but no no I

00:03:57.370 --> 00:03:59.129 
supergluing those in there but no no I
may<00:03:57.760> or<00:03:57.819> may<00:03:57.940> not<00:03:57.970> do<00:03:58.299> that<00:03:58.480> looking<00:03:58.930> at<00:03:59.049> the

00:03:59.129 --> 00:03:59.139 
may or may not do that looking at the

00:03:59.139 --> 00:04:00.539 
may or may not do that looking at the
rest<00:03:59.260> of<00:03:59.349> the<00:03:59.470> suit<00:03:59.650> I<00:03:59.769> think<00:03:59.829> it<00:04:00.040> looks<00:04:00.220> pretty

00:04:00.539 --> 00:04:00.549 
rest of the suit I think it looks pretty

00:04:00.549 --> 00:04:02.250 
rest of the suit I think it looks pretty
good<00:04:00.819> I<00:04:01.120> really<00:04:01.359> like<00:04:01.599> how<00:04:01.690> the<00:04:01.750> paint<00:04:02.049> came

00:04:02.250 --> 00:04:02.260 
good I really like how the paint came

00:04:02.260 --> 00:04:03.569 
good I really like how the paint came
out<00:04:02.440> especially<00:04:02.919> with<00:04:03.040> this<00:04:03.190> shadowing

00:04:03.569 --> 00:04:03.579 
out especially with this shadowing

00:04:03.579 --> 00:04:05.099 
out especially with this shadowing
effect<00:04:03.880> with<00:04:04.000> the<00:04:04.060> black<00:04:04.299> on<00:04:04.540> the<00:04:04.660> red<00:04:04.840> right

00:04:05.099 --> 00:04:05.109 
effect with the black on the red right

00:04:05.109 --> 00:04:06.390 
effect with the black on the red right
there<00:04:05.349> you<00:04:05.500> get<00:04:05.650> these<00:04:05.769> little<00:04:06.010> detailed

00:04:06.390 --> 00:04:06.400 
there you get these little detailed

00:04:06.400 --> 00:04:08.580 
there you get these little detailed
spots<00:04:06.819> of<00:04:07.000> red<00:04:07.209> over<00:04:07.389> here<00:04:07.510> on<00:04:07.900> the<00:04:08.019> neck<00:04:08.230> I

00:04:08.580 --> 00:04:08.590 
spots of red over here on the neck I

00:04:08.590 --> 00:04:10.050 
spots of red over here on the neck I
think<00:04:08.980> they<00:04:09.040> did<00:04:09.190> a<00:04:09.250> good<00:04:09.370> job<00:04:09.430> with<00:04:09.609> that<00:04:09.849> neck

00:04:10.050 --> 00:04:10.060 
think they did a good job with that neck

00:05:33.450 --> 00:05:33.460

side-to-side you don't get any pivot
over<00:05:33.580> here<00:05:33.819> but<00:05:34.059> it<00:05:34.149> crunches<00:05:34.719> very<00:05:34.960> far

00:05:35.219 --> 00:05:35.229 
over here but it crunches very far

00:05:35.229 --> 00:05:37.409 
over here but it crunches very far
forward<00:05:35.529> I<00:05:35.740> really<00:05:36.129> like<00:05:36.279> that<00:05:36.490> and<00:05:36.849> it<00:05:37.210> moves

back<00:05:37.689> very<00:05:37.899> far<00:05:38.169> too<00:05:38.409> and<00:05:38.620> the<00:05:38.710> sculpt<00:05:39.159> and

00:05:39.269 --> 00:05:39.279 
back very far too and the sculpt and

00:05:39.279 --> 00:05:40.860 
back very far too and the sculpt and
paint<00:05:39.309> keeps<00:05:39.819> up<00:05:39.999> and<00:05:40.180> everything<00:05:40.479> so<00:05:40.659> I<00:05:40.689> like
