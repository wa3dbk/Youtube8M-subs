00:00:55.080 --> 00:00:55.090 
attacks I'll go over how to do that here

00:00:55.090 --> 00:00:56.189 
attacks I'll go over how to do that here
in<00:00:55.120> a<00:00:55.210> moment<00:00:55.329> but<00:00:55.539> first<00:00:55.690> I<00:00:55.870> just<00:00:55.899> want<00:00:56.050> to

00:00:56.189 --> 00:00:56.199 
in a moment but first I just want to

00:00:56.199 --> 00:00:57.990 
in a moment but first I just want to
show<00:00:56.350> its<00:00:56.590> attacks<00:00:56.949> gorg<00:00:57.579> will<00:00:57.670> swim<00:00:57.879> around

00:01:00.990 --> 00:01:01.000 
occasionally and it can jump over the

00:01:01.000 --> 00:01:02.729

off simply running to the side instead

00:01:07.380 --> 00:01:09.630

myself<00:01:30.250> get<00:01:30.520> knocked<00:01:30.729> into<00:01:30.880> the<00:01:30.939> water<00:01:31.000> and

00:01:31.410 --> 00:01:31.420 
myself get knocked into the water and

00:01:31.420 --> 00:01:33.210 
myself get knocked into the water and
then<00:01:31.750> got<00:01:31.900> smacked<00:01:32.200> by<00:01:32.409> its<00:01:32.530> tail<00:01:32.799> turn<00:01:33.100> around

00:01:33.210 --> 00:01:33.220 
then got smacked by its tail turn around

00:01:33.220 --> 00:01:35.160 
then got smacked by its tail turn around
swim<00:01:33.610> away<00:01:33.729> go<00:01:34.060> to<00:01:34.119> the<00:01:34.180> opposite<00:01:34.659> side<00:01:34.720> and

00:01:35.160 --> 00:01:35.170 
swim away go to the opposite side and

00:01:35.170 --> 00:01:38.399 
swim away go to the opposite side and
then<00:01:35.380> climb<00:01:35.590> up<00:01:36.119> so<00:01:37.119> it<00:01:37.450> is<00:01:37.659> possible<00:01:38.140> to<00:01:38.170> fight

00:01:38.399 --> 00:01:38.409 
then climb up so it is possible to fight

00:01:38.409 --> 00:01:40.230 
then climb up so it is possible to fight
guy<00:01:38.590> org<00:01:38.770> in<00:01:39.009> the<00:01:39.159> water<00:01:39.340> however<00:01:39.640> it's<00:01:40.030> not

guy org in the water however it's not
very<00:01:40.450> effective<00:01:40.930> you<00:01:41.170> can<00:01:41.380> jump<00:01:41.619> in<00:01:41.740> and<00:01:41.920> use

00:01:42.060 --> 00:01:42.070 
very effective you can jump in and use

00:01:42.070 --> 00:01:43.620

chasing after you like this it's nearly
impossible<00:01:48.939> to<00:01:49.479> win<00:01:49.750> because<00:01:49.960> the<00:01:50.350> front<00:01:50.530> part

00:01:50.700 --> 00:01:50.710 
impossible to win because the front part

00:01:50.710 --> 00:01:52.289 
impossible to win because the front part

attacks is the sides and detail are
vulnerable<00:01:55.630> though<00:01:55.810> so<00:01:56.110> his<00:01:56.439> front<00:01:56.710> part<00:01:56.979> is

00:01:57.200 --> 00:01:57.210 
vulnerable though so his front part is

00:01:57.210 --> 00:01:59.280 
vulnerable though so his front part is
impenetrable<00:01:58.210> when<00:01:58.840> you<00:01:58.899> sink<00:01:59.049> down<00:01:59.079> to<00:01:59.200> the

that if you get too close to them when

you're trying to smack him once he's

00:02:06.009 --> 00:02:07.889 
you're trying to smack him once he's
stunned<00:02:06.250> that<00:02:06.880> you<00:02:07.000> could<00:02:07.119> take<00:02:07.299> damage<00:02:07.509> if<00:02:07.810> he

now<00:02:14.530> as<00:02:14.650> you<00:02:14.740> saw<00:02:14.890> here<00:02:15.130> my<00:02:15.280> fins<00:02:15.550> got<00:02:15.760> caught

00:02:16.050 --> 00:02:16.060 
now as you saw here my fins got caught

00:02:16.060 --> 00:02:18.120 
now as you saw here my fins got caught
on<00:02:16.270> the<00:02:16.450> invulnerable<00:02:17.080> portions<00:02:17.470> of<00:02:17.590> Georg<00:02:17.770> so

00:02:18.120 --> 00:02:18.130 
on the invulnerable portions of Georg so

00:02:18.130 --> 00:02:19.290 
on the invulnerable portions of Georg so
it<00:02:18.220> took<00:02:18.340> a<00:02:18.400> while<00:02:18.490> for<00:02:18.550> them<00:02:18.790> to<00:02:18.850> get<00:02:19.030> back<00:02:19.060> to

00:02:19.290 --> 00:02:19.300 
it took a while for them to get back to

00:02:19.300 --> 00:02:21.960 
it took a while for them to get back to
me<00:02:19.420> now<00:02:20.050> this<00:02:20.290> thus<00:02:20.800> made<00:02:21.100> me<00:02:21.280> fish<00:02:21.490> bait<00:02:21.730> I

00:02:21.960 --> 00:02:21.970 
me now this thus made me fish bait I

00:02:21.970 --> 00:02:24.960 
me now this thus made me fish bait I
suppose<00:02:22.950> your<00:02:23.950> double<00:02:24.190> cutters<00:02:24.460> can<00:02:24.640> do<00:02:24.730> a<00:02:24.760> lot

00:02:24.960 --> 00:02:24.970 
suppose your double cutters can do a lot

00:02:24.970 --> 00:02:26.730 
suppose your double cutters can do a lot
of<00:02:25.060> damage<00:02:25.240> but<00:02:25.510> was<00:02:25.630> more<00:02:25.930> damaging<00:02:26.380> by<00:02:26.470> far

00:02:26.730 --> 00:02:26.740 
of damage but was more damaging by far

00:02:26.740 --> 00:02:28.830 
of damage but was more damaging by far
is<00:02:27.010> using<00:02:27.280> the<00:02:27.340> electric<00:02:27.610> barrier<00:02:27.910> you<00:02:28.720> could

00:02:28.830 --> 00:02:28.840 
is using the electric barrier you could

00:02:28.840 --> 00:02:30.330 
is using the electric barrier you could
stun<00:02:29.050> guy<00:02:29.200> or<00:02:29.350> with<00:02:29.560> the<00:02:29.650> double<00:02:29.890> cutters<00:02:30.160> then

00:02:30.330 --> 00:02:30.340 
stun guy or with the double cutters then

00:02:30.340 --> 00:02:32.160 
stun guy or with the double cutters then
swim<00:02:30.550> into<00:02:30.820> him<00:02:31.150> with<00:02:31.510> our<00:02:31.750> while<00:02:32.020> he's

00:02:32.160 --> 00:02:32.170 
swim into him with our while he's

00:02:32.170 --> 00:02:33.300 
swim into him with our while he's
stunned<00:02:32.380> on<00:02:32.440> the<00:02:32.530> ground<00:02:32.740> and<00:02:32.950> this<00:02:33.040> will<00:02:33.160> do<00:02:33.250> a

00:02:33.300 --> 00:02:33.310 
stunned on the ground and this will do a

00:02:33.310 --> 00:02:34.980 
stunned on the ground and this will do a
lot<00:02:33.550> more<00:02:33.610> damage<00:02:33.790> swim<00:02:34.510> towards<00:02:34.780> them<00:02:34.870> and

00:02:34.980 --> 00:02:34.990 
lot more damage swim towards them and

00:02:34.990 --> 00:02:36.600 
lot more damage swim towards them and
then<00:02:35.350> use<00:02:35.500> the<00:02:35.620> our<00:02:35.740> buck<00:02:35.920> to<00:02:36.070> swim<00:02:36.280> through

00:02:36.600 --> 00:02:36.610 
then use the our buck to swim through

00:02:36.610 --> 00:02:39.080 
then use the our buck to swim through
him<00:02:36.850> this<00:02:37.360> will<00:02:37.540> do<00:02:37.630> massive<00:02:38.170> damage<00:02:38.470> to<00:02:38.500> him

00:02:39.080 --> 00:02:39.090 
him this will do massive damage to him

00:02:39.090 --> 00:02:41.160 
him this will do massive damage to him
okay<00:02:40.090> so<00:02:40.150> stunning<00:02:40.750> it<00:02:40.810> while<00:02:40.990> you're

00:02:41.160 --> 00:02:41.170 
okay so stunning it while you're

00:02:41.170 --> 00:02:42.930 
okay so stunning it while you're
underwater<00:02:41.650> is<00:02:41.860> not<00:02:42.010> really<00:02:42.250> the<00:02:42.430> best<00:02:42.550> plan

00:02:42.930 --> 00:02:42.940 
underwater is not really the best plan

00:02:42.940 --> 00:02:44.550 
underwater is not really the best plan
in<00:02:43.120> the<00:02:43.150> world<00:02:43.210> as<00:02:43.570> you<00:02:43.690> saw<00:02:43.870> I<00:02:43.990> took<00:02:44.170> tons<00:02:44.410> of

00:02:44.550 --> 00:02:44.560 
in the world as you saw I took tons of

00:02:44.560 --> 00:02:45.660 
in the world as you saw I took tons of
damage<00:02:44.830> so<00:02:44.860> it's<00:02:45.070> kind<00:02:45.220> of<00:02:45.250> just<00:02:45.370> an<00:02:45.490> emergency

00:02:45.660 --> 00:02:45.670 
damage so it's kind of just an emergency

00:02:45.670 --> 00:02:47.700 
damage so it's kind of just an emergency
thing<00:02:46.150> so<00:02:46.630> rewinding<00:02:47.080> the<00:02:47.170> battle<00:02:47.380> has<00:02:47.500> just

00:02:47.700 --> 00:02:47.710 
thing so rewinding the battle has just

00:02:47.710 --> 00:02:49.200 
thing so rewinding the battle has just
started<00:02:47.860> from<00:02:48.130> our<00:02:48.280> target<00:02:48.580> Georg<00:02:48.850> and<00:02:49.120> you

00:02:49.200 --> 00:02:49.210 
started from our target Georg and you

00:02:49.210 --> 00:02:50.730 
started from our target Georg and you
can<00:02:49.330> use<00:02:49.480> the<00:02:49.630> double<00:02:49.870> cutters<00:02:50.140> to<00:02:50.320> stun<00:02:50.560> him

00:02:50.730 --> 00:02:50.740 
can use the double cutters to stun him

00:02:50.740 --> 00:02:52.440 
can use the double cutters to stun him
and<00:02:50.920> now<00:02:51.250> you<00:02:51.310> can<00:02:51.520> pick<00:02:51.820> off<00:02:52.000> and<00:02:52.240> put<00:02:52.360> on

00:02:52.440 --> 00:02:52.450 
and now you can pick off and put on

00:02:52.450 --> 00:02:54.060 
and now you can pick off and put on
these<00:02:52.570> or<00:02:52.750> mask<00:02:52.960> so<00:02:53.110> you<00:02:53.140> can<00:02:53.350> continue<00:02:53.740> moving

00:02:54.060 --> 00:02:54.070 
these or mask so you can continue moving

00:02:54.070 --> 00:02:55.410 
these or mask so you can continue moving
around<00:02:54.250> and<00:02:54.550> now<00:02:54.880> you<00:02:54.940> can<00:02:55.120> jump<00:02:55.270> into<00:02:55.360> the

00:02:55.410 --> 00:02:55.420 
around and now you can jump into the

00:02:55.420 --> 00:02:57.450 
around and now you can jump into the
water<00:02:55.600> while<00:02:55.990> he<00:02:56.050> screams<00:02:56.500> stunned<00:02:56.770> at<00:02:56.950> this

00:02:57.450 --> 00:02:57.460 
water while he screams stunned at this

00:02:57.460 --> 00:02:58.350 
water while he screams stunned at this
point<00:02:57.670> you<00:02:57.760> can<00:02:57.850> sink<00:02:58.060> down<00:02:58.180> to<00:02:58.210> the<00:02:58.300> bottom

00:02:58.350 --> 00:02:58.360 
point you can sink down to the bottom

00:02:58.360 --> 00:02:59.940 
point you can sink down to the bottom
and<00:02:58.720> you<00:02:58.840> can<00:02:58.870> stab<00:02:59.170> them<00:02:59.320> if<00:02:59.410> you<00:02:59.500> want<00:02:59.740> but

00:02:59.940 --> 00:02:59.950 
and you can stab them if you want but

00:02:59.950 --> 00:03:01.140 
and you can stab them if you want but
you<00:03:00.040> don't<00:03:00.070> review<00:03:00.430> very<00:03:00.580> much<00:03:00.730> damage<00:03:01.060> this

00:03:01.140 --> 00:03:01.150 
you don't review very much damage this

00:03:01.150 --> 00:03:02.670 
you don't review very much damage this
way<00:03:01.330> holding<00:03:01.780> your<00:03:01.930> shield<00:03:02.110> in<00:03:02.290> case<00:03:02.440> Cairo

00:03:02.670 --> 00:03:02.680 
way holding your shield in case Cairo

00:03:02.680 --> 00:03:04.140 
way holding your shield in case Cairo
touches<00:03:03.040> you<00:03:03.130> real<00:03:03.250> quick<00:03:03.430> and<00:03:03.580> then<00:03:03.820> you<00:03:04.000> want

00:03:04.140 --> 00:03:04.150 
touches you real quick and then you want

00:03:04.150 --> 00:03:05.430 
touches you real quick and then you want
to<00:03:04.180> swim<00:03:04.360> over<00:03:04.450> to<00:03:04.570> the<00:03:04.690> opposite<00:03:05.080> side<00:03:05.170> of<00:03:05.320> the

00:03:05.430 --> 00:03:05.440 
to swim over to the opposite side of the

00:03:05.440 --> 00:03:07.770 
to swim over to the opposite side of the
platform<00:03:05.590> so<00:03:06.370> that<00:03:06.430> you<00:03:06.520> you're<00:03:07.240> too<00:03:07.450> far<00:03:07.600> away

00:03:07.770 --> 00:03:07.780 
platform so that you you're too far away

00:03:07.780 --> 00:03:09.300 
platform so that you you're too far away
from<00:03:07.840> him<00:03:08.050> so<00:03:08.080> he<00:03:08.170> can't<00:03:08.470> grab<00:03:08.620> you<00:03:08.830> if<00:03:09.190> you're

00:03:09.300 --> 00:03:09.310 
from him so he can't grab you if you're

00:03:09.310 --> 00:03:10.620 
from him so he can't grab you if you're
really<00:03:09.430> good<00:03:09.640> you<00:03:09.670> can<00:03:09.790> dolphin<00:03:10.210> jump<00:03:10.360> onto<00:03:10.540> a

00:03:10.620 --> 00:03:10.630 
really good you can dolphin jump onto a

00:03:10.630 --> 00:03:11.970 
really good you can dolphin jump onto a
platform<00:03:10.840> otherwise<00:03:11.290> you<00:03:11.500> can<00:03:11.620> just<00:03:11.770> climb<00:03:11.920> up

00:03:11.970 --> 00:03:11.980 
platform otherwise you can just climb up

00:03:11.980 --> 00:03:14.280 
platform otherwise you can just climb up
so<00:03:12.970> at<00:03:13.030> this<00:03:13.120> point<00:03:13.330> if<00:03:13.510> guy<00:03:13.690> arc<00:03:13.900> is<00:03:14.020> really

00:03:14.280 --> 00:03:14.290 
so at this point if guy arc is really

00:03:14.290 --> 00:03:15.990 
so at this point if guy arc is really
far<00:03:14.470> away<00:03:14.590> like<00:03:14.980> so<00:03:15.280> and<00:03:15.489> you<00:03:15.580> can't<00:03:15.790> use<00:03:15.970> your

00:03:15.990 --> 00:03:16.000 
far away like so and you can't use your

00:03:16.000 --> 00:03:17.580 
far away like so and you can't use your
double<00:03:16.420> cutters<00:03:16.690> instead<00:03:17.050> you<00:03:17.140> need<00:03:17.260> to<00:03:17.320> shoot

00:03:17.580 --> 00:03:17.590 
double cutters instead you need to shoot

00:03:17.590 --> 00:03:19.530 
double cutters instead you need to shoot
him<00:03:17.739> with<00:03:17.860> a<00:03:17.920> regular<00:03:18.400> arrow<00:03:18.640> this<00:03:19.209> will<00:03:19.390> stun

00:03:19.530 --> 00:03:19.540 
him with a regular arrow this will stun

00:03:19.540 --> 00:03:21.120 
him with a regular arrow this will stun
him<00:03:19.720> quickly<00:03:19.959> put<00:03:20.170> on<00:03:20.200> the<00:03:20.350> Zorro<00:03:20.530> mask<00:03:20.709> jump

00:03:21.120 --> 00:03:21.130 
him quickly put on the Zorro mask jump

00:03:21.130 --> 00:03:22.800 
him quickly put on the Zorro mask jump
into<00:03:21.340> the<00:03:21.430> water<00:03:21.580> and<00:03:21.850> what<00:03:22.270> does<00:03:22.420> far<00:03:22.660> more

00:03:22.800 --> 00:03:22.810 
into the water and what does far more

00:03:22.810 --> 00:03:24.930 
into the water and what does far more
damage<00:03:23.140> is<00:03:23.290> just<00:03:23.320> swim<00:03:23.620> into<00:03:23.830> him<00:03:24.040> with<00:03:24.220> the<00:03:24.250> R

00:03:24.930 --> 00:03:24.940 
damage is just swim into him with the R

00:03:24.940 --> 00:03:26.670 
damage is just swim into him with the R
button<00:03:25.180> and<00:03:25.450> so<00:03:25.750> just<00:03:25.930> keep<00:03:26.050> it<00:03:26.170> on<00:03:26.260> pressed<00:03:26.560> in

00:03:26.670 --> 00:03:26.680 
button and so just keep it on pressed in

00:03:26.680 --> 00:03:28.020 
button and so just keep it on pressed in
until<00:03:26.920> you're<00:03:27.040> well<00:03:27.160> past<00:03:27.310> Georg<00:03:27.700> this<00:03:27.910> way

00:03:28.020 --> 00:03:28.030 
until you're well past Georg this way

00:03:28.030 --> 00:03:29.670 
until you're well past Georg this way
you<00:03:28.090> don't<00:03:28.239> take<00:03:28.360> damage<00:03:28.510> then<00:03:29.170> dolphin<00:03:29.530> jump

00:03:29.670 --> 00:03:29.680 
you don't take damage then dolphin jump

00:03:29.680 --> 00:03:30.810 
you don't take damage then dolphin jump
back<00:03:29.770> on<00:03:29.890> the<00:03:30.040> platform<00:03:30.400> if<00:03:30.520> you're<00:03:30.640> really

00:03:30.810 --> 00:03:30.820

00:04:10.970 --> 00:04:13.840 

so<00:04:11.840> here<00:04:11.960> I<00:04:11.990> should<00:04:12.320> have<00:04:12.800> used<00:04:13.070> our<00:04:13.370> to<00:04:13.670> try

00:04:13.840 --> 00:04:13.850 
so here I should have used our to try

00:04:13.850 --> 00:04:15.310 
so here I should have used our to try
stunning<00:04:14.240> car<00:04:14.390> org<00:04:14.570> as<00:04:14.720> long<00:04:14.900> as<00:04:15.050> it<00:04:15.200> was

00:04:15.310 --> 00:04:15.320 
stunning car org as long as it was

00:04:15.320 --> 00:04:16.750 
stunning car org as long as it was
swimming<00:04:15.560> right<00:04:15.680> next<00:04:15.920> to<00:04:16.010> me<00:04:16.070> but<00:04:16.250> I<00:04:16.310> didn't

00:04:16.750 --> 00:04:16.760 
swimming right next to me but I didn't

00:04:16.760 --> 00:04:19.030 
swimming right next to me but I didn't
so<00:04:17.000> instead<00:04:17.209> I<00:04:17.299> just<00:04:17.480> took<00:04:17.540> damage<00:04:17.799> now<00:04:18.799> if<00:04:18.920> the

00:04:19.030 --> 00:04:19.040 
so instead I just took damage now if the

00:04:19.040 --> 00:04:20.259 
so instead I just took damage now if the
little<00:04:19.160> fish<00:04:19.370> get<00:04:19.580> in<00:04:19.670> your<00:04:19.760> way<00:04:19.910> you<00:04:19.970> can<00:04:20.090> just

00:04:20.259 --> 00:04:20.269 
little fish get in your way you can just

00:04:20.269 --> 00:04:21.520 
little fish get in your way you can just
swim<00:04:20.420> through<00:04:20.720> them<00:04:20.840> with<00:04:21.110> the<00:04:21.230> electric

00:04:21.520 --> 00:04:21.530 
swim through them with the electric

00:04:21.530 --> 00:04:23.110 
swim through them with the electric
barrier<00:04:21.799> to<00:04:21.980> kill<00:04:22.220> them<00:04:22.370> and<00:04:22.550> some<00:04:22.940> of<00:04:23.030> them

00:04:23.110 --> 00:04:23.120 
barrier to kill them and some of them

00:04:23.120 --> 00:04:24.640 
barrier to kill them and some of them
even<00:04:23.240> drop<00:04:23.540> recovery<00:04:23.900> hearts<00:04:24.140> but<00:04:24.290> it's<00:04:24.440> not

00:04:24.640 --> 00:04:24.650 
even drop recovery hearts but it's not

00:04:24.650 --> 00:04:25.960 
even drop recovery hearts but it's not
really<00:04:24.860> worth<00:04:24.980> trying<00:04:25.250> to<00:04:25.430> get<00:04:25.580> them<00:04:25.730> because

00:04:25.960 --> 00:04:25.970 
really worth trying to get them because

00:04:25.970 --> 00:04:27.580 
really worth trying to get them because
Georg<00:04:26.510> will<00:04:26.630> probably<00:04:26.870> just<00:04:26.990> eat<00:04:27.170> you<00:04:27.410> and

00:04:27.580 --> 00:04:27.590 
Georg will probably just eat you and

00:04:27.590 --> 00:04:29.200 
Georg will probably just eat you and
deal<00:04:27.680> more<00:04:27.830> damage<00:04:27.980> to<00:04:28.250> you<00:04:28.340> while<00:04:28.520> you<00:04:28.700> that

00:04:29.200 --> 00:04:29.210 
deal more damage to you while you that

00:04:29.210 --> 00:04:30.640 
deal more damage to you while you that
you<00:04:29.300> then<00:04:29.570> you<00:04:29.690> would<00:04:29.870> have<00:04:30.020> recovered

00:04:30.640 --> 00:04:30.650 
you then you would have recovered

00:04:30.650 --> 00:04:33.880 
you then you would have recovered
otherwise<00:04:32.080> to<00:04:33.080> successfully<00:04:33.560> pull<00:04:33.740> off<00:04:33.860> a

00:04:33.880 --> 00:04:33.890 
otherwise to successfully pull off a

00:04:33.890 --> 00:04:35.440 
otherwise to successfully pull off a
dolphin<00:04:34.310> jump<00:04:34.490> you<00:04:34.580> have<00:04:34.760> to<00:04:34.910> be<00:04:35.000> a<00:04:35.030> little<00:04:35.300> bit

00:04:35.440 --> 00:04:35.450 
dolphin jump you have to be a little bit

00:04:35.450 --> 00:04:36.880 
dolphin jump you have to be a little bit
below<00:04:35.600> the<00:04:35.720> surface<00:04:36.170> of<00:04:36.290> the<00:04:36.350> water<00:04:36.560> so<00:04:36.800> that

00:04:36.880 --> 00:04:36.890 
below the surface of the water so that

00:04:36.890 --> 00:04:38.320 
below the surface of the water so that
when<00:04:37.040> you<00:04:37.250> aim<00:04:37.460> upwards<00:04:37.850> with<00:04:37.940> the<00:04:38.030> analog

00:04:38.320 --> 00:04:38.330 
when you aim upwards with the analog

00:04:38.330 --> 00:04:40.270 
when you aim upwards with the analog
stick<00:04:38.390> you'll<00:04:38.750> jump<00:04:39.050> out<00:04:39.260> of<00:04:39.290> the<00:04:39.560> water<00:04:39.680> it's

00:04:40.270 --> 00:04:40.280 
stick you'll jump out of the water it's

00:04:40.280 --> 00:04:41.380 
stick you'll jump out of the water it's
a<00:04:40.340> little<00:04:40.490> bit<00:04:40.580> difficult<00:04:40.730> when<00:04:41.240> you're

00:04:41.380 --> 00:04:41.390 
a little bit difficult when you're

00:04:41.390 --> 00:04:42.670 
a little bit difficult when you're
facing<00:04:41.600> directly<00:04:42.050> towards<00:04:42.410> the<00:04:42.500> platform

00:04:42.670 --> 00:04:42.680 
facing directly towards the platform

00:04:42.680 --> 00:04:44.470 
facing directly towards the platform
though<00:04:43.040> so<00:04:43.310> instead<00:04:43.700> here's<00:04:44.030> a<00:04:44.090> little<00:04:44.300> tip

00:04:44.470 --> 00:04:44.480 
though so instead here's a little tip

00:04:44.480 --> 00:04:46.270 
though so instead here's a little tip
don't<00:04:45.080> aim<00:04:45.260> directly<00:04:45.620> towards<00:04:46.040> the<00:04:46.100> platform

00:04:46.270 --> 00:04:46.280 
don't aim directly towards the platform

00:04:46.280 --> 00:04:47.950 
don't aim directly towards the platform
but<00:04:46.640> instead<00:04:46.880> come<00:04:47.420> at<00:04:47.510> it<00:04:47.630> from<00:04:47.750> an<00:04:47.870> angle

00:04:47.950 --> 00:04:47.960 
but instead come at it from an angle

00:04:47.960 --> 00:04:50.170 
but instead come at it from an angle
like<00:04:48.470> this<00:04:48.740> it<00:04:49.400> gives<00:04:49.520> you<00:04:49.640> a<00:04:49.670> little<00:04:49.910> bit<00:04:50.030> more

00:04:50.170 --> 00:04:50.180 
like this it gives you a little bit more

00:04:50.180 --> 00:04:51.610 
like this it gives you a little bit more
wiggle<00:04:50.420> room<00:04:50.540> for<00:04:50.870> error<00:04:51.230> and<00:04:51.350> it's<00:04:51.500> a<00:04:51.530> little

00:04:51.610 --> 00:04:51.620 
wiggle room for error and it's a little

00:04:51.620 --> 00:04:53.080 
wiggle room for error and it's a little
bit<00:04:51.770> easier<00:04:52.040> to<00:04:52.130> pull<00:04:52.280> off<00:04:52.460> so<00:04:52.700> unless<00:04:52.940> you're

00:04:53.080 --> 00:04:53.090 
bit easier to pull off so unless you're

00:04:53.090 --> 00:04:54.760 
bit easier to pull off so unless you're
really<00:04:53.360> good<00:04:53.570> at<00:04:53.780> timing<00:04:53.990> it<00:04:54.200> and<00:04:54.410> you<00:04:54.590> had<00:04:54.740> a

00:04:54.760 --> 00:04:54.770 
really good at timing it and you had a

00:04:54.770 --> 00:04:56.350 
really good at timing it and you had a
lot<00:04:54.890> of<00:04:54.920> practice<00:04:55.280> like<00:04:55.430> I<00:04:55.580> have<00:04:55.790> then<00:04:56.330> I

00:04:56.350 --> 00:04:56.360 
lot of practice like I have then I

00:04:56.360 --> 00:04:57.790 
lot of practice like I have then I
recommend<00:04:56.630> you<00:04:56.810> do<00:04:56.960> it<00:04:57.050> this<00:04:57.140> way<00:04:57.320> instead<00:04:57.470> and

00:04:57.790 --> 00:04:57.800 
recommend you do it this way instead and

00:04:57.800 --> 00:04:59.890 
recommend you do it this way instead and
always<00:04:58.040> go<00:04:58.460> try<00:04:58.850> and<00:04:58.970> dolphin<00:04:59.210> jump<00:04:59.390> at<00:04:59.510> angles

00:04:59.890 --> 00:04:59.900 
always go try and dolphin jump at angles

00:04:59.900 --> 00:05:13.750 
always go try and dolphin jump at angles
if<00:05:00.170> you<00:05:00.440> try<00:05:00.620> to<00:05:00.680> open<00:05:00.890> something<00:05:01.070> at<00:05:01.220> all

00:05:13.750 --> 00:05:13.760 

00:05:13.760 --> 00:05:16.640

00:05:16.640 --> 00:05:16.650 
Tynan and that is how you defeat the

00:05:16.650 --> 00:05:18.590 
Tynan and that is how you defeat the

00:05:20.270 --> 00:05:20.280 
are some green jars in each corner of

00:05:20.280 --> 00:05:22.010 
are some green jars in each corner of
the<00:05:20.400> room<00:05:20.580> underwater<00:05:21.030> that<00:05:21.330> have<00:05:21.540> magic<00:05:21.900> in

00:05:22.010 --> 00:05:22.020 
the room underwater that have magic in

00:05:22.020 --> 00:05:23.600 
the room underwater that have magic in
them<00:05:22.170> but<00:05:22.350> that<00:05:22.530> seems<00:05:22.860> kind<00:05:23.070> of<00:05:23.130> scary<00:05:23.370> to<00:05:23.520> me

00:05:23.600 --> 00:05:23.610 
them but that seems kind of scary to me

00:05:23.610 --> 00:05:24.860 
them but that seems kind of scary to me
like<00:05:23.850> that's<00:05:24.330> one<00:05:24.420> of<00:05:24.510> the<00:05:24.570> most<00:05:24.690> dangerous

00:05:24.860 --> 00:05:24.870 
like that's one of the most dangerous

00:05:24.870 --> 00:05:26.630 
like that's one of the most dangerous

00:05:31.850 --> 00:05:31.860 
of magic you have to put yourself in

00:05:31.860 --> 00:05:33.320 
of magic you have to put yourself in
harm's<00:05:31.980> way<00:05:32.160> just<00:05:32.430> to<00:05:32.490> get<00:05:32.640> some<00:05:32.820> more<00:05:32.970> like

magic isn't required to beat this boss
it<00:05:35.070> just<00:05:35.220> makes<00:05:35.340> it<00:05:35.400> easier<00:05:35.700> but<00:05:35.880> still<00:05:36.000> like

00:05:36.440 --> 00:05:36.450 
it just makes it easier but still like

00:05:36.450 --> 00:05:39.680 
it just makes it easier but still like
that's<00:05:37.020> so<00:05:37.230> scary<00:05:37.290> to<00:05:37.890> make<00:05:38.340> you<00:05:38.490> do<00:05:38.640> that<00:05:38.690> now
