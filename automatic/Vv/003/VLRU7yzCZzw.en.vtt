 and a keyboard unit and that 

00:00:18.480 --> 00:00:23.480
 tray can be easily removed from the

00:00:40.050 --> 00:00:44.400

00:01:03.690 --> 00:01:09.930
 Here are a few connections down here 

00:01:06.659 --> 00:01:13.920
 is there a full-fledged usb socket that 

00:01:09.930 --> 00:01:16.950
 means you can us a normal usb 

00:01:13.920 --> 00:01:18.030

00:01:16.950 --> 00:01:22.740
 external hard drive 

00:01:18.030 --> 00:01:25.710
 then there is still a usb socket from 

00:01:22.740 --> 00:01:28.890

00:01:47.609 --> 00:01:53.700

00:02:14.100 --> 00:02:19.590

00:02:16.920 --> 00:02:22.980
 when watching videos hp pavilion 

00:02:19.590 --> 00:02:24.690
 away so the battery is installed in the tablet 

00:02:22.980 --> 00:02:27.660
 that means nobody here in the keyboard 

00:02:24.690 --> 00:02:30.860
 unit and the battery here has one 

00:02:27.660 --> 00:02:33.570

00:02:30.860 --> 00:02:35.220
