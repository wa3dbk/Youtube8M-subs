know<00:00:09.179> that<00:00:09.330> there's<00:00:09.510> a<00:00:09.599> certain<00:00:09.750> order<00:00:10.019> you

00:00:10.280 --> 00:00:10.290 
know that there's a certain order you

00:00:10.290 --> 00:00:12.200 
know that there's a certain order you
should<00:00:10.500> do<00:00:10.650> your<00:00:10.920> stretches<00:00:11.309> in<00:00:11.429> and<00:00:11.639> that

does<00:00:12.480> sound<00:00:12.750> really<00:00:12.960> weird<00:00:13.440> because<00:00:13.710> um<00:00:14.309> I

00:00:14.990 --> 00:00:15.000 
does sound really weird because um I

00:00:15.000 --> 00:00:17.240 
does sound really weird because um I
mean<00:00:15.480> people<00:00:16.109> just<00:00:16.289> do<00:00:16.440> stretching<00:00:17.070> is<00:00:17.190> just

00:00:17.240 --> 00:00:17.250 
mean people just do stretching is just

00:00:17.250 --> 00:00:20.240 
mean people just do stretching is just
kind<00:00:17.520> of<00:00:17.580> a<00:00:17.699> thing<00:00:17.970> that<00:00:18.510> you<00:00:18.810> just<00:00:18.980> do<00:00:19.980> to

00:00:20.240 --> 00:00:20.250 
kind of a thing that you just do to

00:00:20.250 --> 00:00:21.620 
kind of a thing that you just do to
stretch<00:00:20.430> out<00:00:20.580> your<00:00:20.640> muscles<00:00:20.939> you<00:00:21.029> know<00:00:21.180> but

00:00:21.620 --> 00:00:21.630 
stretch out your muscles you know but

00:00:21.630 --> 00:00:24.500 
stretch out your muscles you know but
there<00:00:21.840> is<00:00:21.990> actually<00:00:22.920> more<00:00:22.949> to<00:00:23.220> it<00:00:23.699> you<00:00:24.119> can't

00:00:24.500 --> 00:00:24.510 
there is actually more to it you can't

00:00:24.510 --> 00:00:27.800 
there is actually more to it you can't
just<00:00:24.869> do<00:00:25.170> random<00:00:25.380> stretches<00:00:26.070> and<00:00:26.810> think

00:00:27.800 --> 00:00:27.810 
just do random stretches and think

00:00:27.810 --> 00:00:29.300 
just do random stretches and think
they're<00:00:27.990> just<00:00:28.109> gonna<00:00:28.289> automatically<00:00:29.039> help

00:00:29.300 --> 00:00:29.310 
they're just gonna automatically help

00:00:29.310 --> 00:00:32.030 
they're just gonna automatically help
you<00:00:29.490> um<00:00:30.179> there<00:00:30.689> is<00:00:30.869> a<00:00:30.900> certain<00:00:31.260> order<00:00:31.470> like<00:00:31.769> you

00:00:32.030 --> 00:00:32.040 
you um there is a certain order like you

00:00:32.040 --> 00:00:33.740 
you um there is a certain order like you
shouldn't<00:00:32.399> you<00:00:32.700> should<00:00:32.969> never<00:00:33.120> ever<00:00:33.270> start

00:00:33.740 --> 00:00:33.750 
shouldn't you should never ever start

00:00:33.750 --> 00:00:36.200 
shouldn't you should never ever start
with<00:00:33.870> splits<00:00:34.200> first<00:00:34.500> um<00:00:34.950> the<00:00:35.760> reason<00:00:36.090> is

00:00:36.200 --> 00:00:36.210 
with splits first um the reason is

00:00:36.210 --> 00:00:39.170 
with splits first um the reason is
because<00:00:36.390> when<00:00:37.050> you<00:00:37.140> do<00:00:37.260> splits<00:00:37.850> first<00:00:38.850> your

00:00:39.170 --> 00:00:39.180 
because when you do splits first your

00:00:39.180 --> 00:00:41.030 
because when you do splits first your
muscles<00:00:39.629> aren't<00:00:39.750> ready<00:00:39.989> for<00:00:40.079> that<00:00:40.260> so<00:00:40.800> what

00:00:41.030 --> 00:00:41.040 
muscles aren't ready for that so what

00:00:41.040 --> 00:00:42.979 
muscles aren't ready for that so what
they<00:00:41.160> can<00:00:41.340> do<00:00:41.460> is<00:00:41.610> they<00:00:41.640> can<00:00:41.760> get<00:00:42.390> really<00:00:42.660> tight

00:00:42.979 --> 00:00:42.989 
they can do is they can get really tight

00:00:42.989 --> 00:00:45.049 
they can do is they can get really tight
and<00:00:43.200> that's<00:00:43.649> what<00:00:44.129> causes<00:00:44.370> them<00:00:44.640> to<00:00:44.670> be<00:00:44.850> sore

00:00:45.049 --> 00:00:45.059 
and that's what causes them to be sore

00:00:45.059 --> 00:00:46.670 
and that's what causes them to be sore
my<00:00:45.539> old<00:00:45.719> ballet<00:00:45.899> teacher<00:00:46.230> told<00:00:46.469> me<00:00:46.559> that

00:00:46.670 --> 00:00:46.680 
my old ballet teacher told me that

00:00:46.680 --> 00:00:50.209 
my old ballet teacher told me that
actually<00:00:46.860> so<00:00:47.570> yeah<00:00:48.570> that's<00:00:48.840> um<00:00:49.379> really

00:00:50.209 --> 00:00:50.219 
actually so yeah that's um really

00:00:50.219 --> 00:00:51.410

have to spend like 30 minutes warming up
literally<00:06:27.039> I<00:06:27.190> always<00:06:27.580> spent<00:06:27.910> right<00:06:28.060> there

00:06:28.529 --> 00:06:28.539 
literally I always spent right there

00:06:28.539 --> 00:06:31.469 
literally I always spent right there
five<00:06:28.810> minutes<00:06:29.320> well<00:06:30.010> actually<00:06:30.700> no<00:06:31.030> like<00:06:31.180> six

00:06:31.469 --> 00:06:31.479

00:06:31.479 --> 00:06:34.290 
five minutes well actually no like six
minutes<00:06:31.810> my<00:06:31.990> YouTube<00:06:32.470> Maya<00:06:33.120> computer<00:06:34.120> says

00:06:34.290 --> 00:06:34.300 
minutes my YouTube Maya computer says

00:06:34.300 --> 00:06:35.730 
minutes my YouTube Maya computer says
six<00:06:34.570> minutes<00:06:34.870> but<00:06:34.990> if<00:06:35.110> I<00:06:35.200> do<00:06:35.260> a<00:06:35.349> full<00:06:35.590> out

00:06:35.730 --> 00:06:35.740 
six minutes but if I do a full out

00:06:35.740 --> 00:06:38.129 
six minutes but if I do a full out
you're<00:06:36.280> probably<00:06:36.580> take<00:06:36.700> around<00:06:36.940> maybe<00:06:37.330> a

00:06:38.129 --> 00:06:38.139 
you're probably take around maybe a

00:06:38.139 --> 00:06:40.739 
you're probably take around maybe a
-<00:06:38.229> ten<00:06:38.409> minutes<00:06:38.439> and<00:06:39.009> you<00:06:39.849> should<00:06:40.060> really<00:06:40.330> need

00:06:40.739 --> 00:06:40.749 
- ten minutes and you should really need

00:06:40.749 --> 00:06:42.989 
- ten minutes and you should really need
to<00:06:40.870> exceed<00:06:41.199> that<00:06:41.439> um<00:06:41.680> that's<00:06:42.340> how<00:06:42.610> much<00:06:42.789> any

00:06:42.989 --> 00:06:42.999 
to exceed that um that's how much any

00:06:42.999 --> 00:06:45.420 
to exceed that um that's how much any
distraction<00:06:43.659> everybody<00:06:44.620> is<00:06:44.770> different<00:06:44.949> so<00:06:45.400> I

00:06:45.420 --> 00:06:45.430 
distraction everybody is different so I

00:06:45.430 --> 00:06:47.309 
distraction everybody is different so I
mean<00:06:45.669> if<00:06:45.789> you<00:06:45.819> need<00:06:46.120> 20<00:06:46.360> minutes<00:06:46.449> take<00:06:46.900> the<00:06:47.050> 20

00:06:49.439 --> 00:06:49.449 
minutes but for me I only generally need

00:06:49.449 --> 00:06:51.149 
minutes but for me I only generally need
10<00:06:49.689> minutes<00:06:49.870> um<00:06:50.229> you<00:06:50.560> really<00:06:50.680> kinda<00:06:51.039> have<00:06:51.129> to
