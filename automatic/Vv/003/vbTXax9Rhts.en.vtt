it's Adam here at whisper reviews and

00:00:02.340 --> 00:00:04.220 
it's Adam here at whisper reviews and
I'm<00:00:02.820> gonna<00:00:02.909> show<00:00:03.210> you<00:00:03.270> how<00:00:03.510> we<00:00:03.570> take<00:00:03.750> down<00:00:04.049> the

00:00:04.220 --> 00:00:04.230 
I'm gonna show you how we take down the

00:00:04.230 --> 00:00:07.280 
I'm gonna show you how we take down the
REI<00:00:04.589> camp<00:00:05.040> dome<00:00:05.279> to<00:00:05.609> kind<00:00:06.450> of<00:00:06.480> the<00:00:06.629> processes

00:00:07.280 --> 00:00:07.290 
REI camp dome to kind of the processes

00:00:07.290 --> 00:00:09.259 
REI camp dome to kind of the processes
and<00:00:07.319> what<00:00:07.649> it<00:00:07.710> looks<00:00:07.799> like<00:00:08.040> again<00:00:08.940> that<00:00:09.000> the

00:00:09.259 --> 00:00:09.269 
and what it looks like again that the

00:00:09.269 --> 00:00:11.299 
and what it looks like again that the
the<00:00:09.690> camp<00:00:09.990> dome<00:00:10.170> too<00:00:10.469> is<00:00:10.679> set<00:00:10.950> together<00:00:11.070> with

00:00:11.299 --> 00:00:11.309 
the camp dome too is set together with

00:00:11.309 --> 00:00:15.340 
the camp dome too is set together with
the<00:00:11.730> the<00:00:12.389> clip<00:00:13.219> system<00:00:14.219> as<00:00:14.429> opposed<00:00:14.940> to<00:00:15.150> the

00:00:15.340 --> 00:00:15.350 
the the clip system as opposed to the

00:00:15.350 --> 00:00:22.279 
the the clip system as opposed to the
tent<00:00:16.350> pole<00:00:17.869> sleeve<00:00:18.869> design<00:00:19.500> and<00:00:20.449> so<00:00:21.449> I<00:00:21.720> found

00:00:22.279 --> 00:00:22.289 
tent pole sleeve design and so I found

00:00:22.289 --> 00:00:22.609 
tent pole sleeve design and so I found
it

00:00:22.609 --> 00:00:22.619 
it

00:00:22.619 --> 00:00:25.220 
it
you<00:00:22.859> can<00:00:23.010> either<00:00:23.300> unclip<00:00:24.300> these<00:00:24.539> which<00:00:25.050> is<00:00:25.080> the

00:00:25.220 --> 00:00:25.230 
you can either unclip these which is the

00:00:25.230 --> 00:00:26.900 
you can either unclip these which is the
reverse<00:00:25.500> order<00:00:25.769> of<00:00:25.859> us<00:00:26.010> of<00:00:26.220> assembly<00:00:26.789> and

00:00:26.900 --> 00:00:26.910 
reverse order of us of assembly and

00:00:26.910 --> 00:00:28.550 
reverse order of us of assembly and
setting<00:00:27.090> it<00:00:27.180> up<00:00:27.269> let<00:00:27.840> me<00:00:27.869> clip<00:00:28.080> these<00:00:28.230> and<00:00:28.470> then

00:00:28.550 --> 00:00:28.560 
setting it up let me clip these and then

00:00:28.560 --> 00:00:30.140 
setting it up let me clip these and then
bring<00:00:28.769> down<00:00:28.949> but<00:00:29.609> I<00:00:29.640> found<00:00:29.910> it<00:00:30.000> a<00:00:30.029> little

00:00:30.140 --> 00:00:30.150 
bring down but I found it a little

00:00:30.150 --> 00:00:32.510 
bring down but I found it a little
quicker<00:00:30.359> and<00:00:30.480> easier<00:00:30.630> to<00:00:31.080> pretend<00:00:31.980> as<00:00:32.160> if<00:00:32.189> it

00:00:32.510 --> 00:00:32.520 
quicker and easier to pretend as if it

00:00:32.520 --> 00:00:35.389 
quicker and easier to pretend as if it
had<00:00:32.759> the<00:00:33.030> the<00:00:33.420> poles<00:00:33.660> and<00:00:33.899> sleeves<00:00:34.230> and<00:00:34.620> I<00:00:35.130> just

00:00:35.389 --> 00:00:35.399 
had the the poles and sleeves and I just

00:00:35.399 --> 00:00:41.270 
had the the poles and sleeves and I just
undo<00:00:36.149> these<00:00:36.420> two<00:00:36.480> bottom<00:00:37.079> sections<00:00:37.530> I<00:00:40.280> pull

00:00:41.270 --> 00:00:41.280 
undo these two bottom sections I pull

00:00:41.280 --> 00:00:44.209 
undo these two bottom sections I pull
this<00:00:41.430> thing<00:00:41.640> down<00:00:41.790> like<00:00:42.600> that<00:00:42.840> and<00:00:43.410> then<00:00:44.070> it's

00:00:44.209 --> 00:00:44.219 
this thing down like that and then it's

00:00:44.219 --> 00:00:44.720 
this thing down like that and then it's
out

00:00:44.720 --> 00:00:44.730 
out

00:00:44.730 --> 00:00:46.279 
out
see<00:00:44.969> how<00:00:45.120> it's<00:00:45.239> out<00:00:45.420> of<00:00:45.450> the<00:00:45.660> little<00:00:45.899> grommet

00:00:46.279 --> 00:00:46.289 
see how it's out of the little grommet

00:00:46.289 --> 00:00:52.700 
see how it's out of the little grommet
and<00:00:46.520> then<00:00:47.520> I<00:00:47.579> pull<00:00:47.820> this<00:00:47.940> section<00:00:48.360> down<00:00:51.710> and

00:00:52.700 --> 00:00:52.710 
and then I pull this section down and

00:00:52.710 --> 00:00:54.200 
and then I pull this section down and
then<00:00:52.890> this<00:00:53.010> thing<00:00:53.280> here<00:00:53.579> you<00:00:53.850> see<00:00:54.000> a<00:00:54.030> little

00:00:54.200 --> 00:00:54.210 
then this thing here you see a little

00:00:54.210 --> 00:00:57.860 
then this thing here you see a little
detent<00:00:54.920> now<00:00:55.920> watch<00:00:56.160> it<00:00:56.190> fall<00:00:56.579> that<00:00:57.300> was<00:00:57.390> quick

00:00:57.860 --> 00:00:57.870 
detent now watch it fall that was quick

00:00:57.870 --> 00:01:00.889 
detent now watch it fall that was quick
it<00:00:58.440> felt<00:00:58.800> pretty<00:00:58.890> quickly<00:00:59.250> and<00:00:59.789> I<00:01:00.629> don't<00:01:00.780> have

00:01:00.889 --> 00:01:00.899

00:01:00.899 --> 00:01:05.440 
it felt pretty quickly and I don't have
to<00:01:00.989> unclip<00:01:01.350> anything<00:01:01.770> I<00:01:02.010> just<00:01:02.520> pull<00:01:03.799> these<00:01:04.799> out

00:01:05.440 --> 00:01:05.450 
to unclip anything I just pull these out

00:01:05.450 --> 00:01:08.990 
to unclip anything I just pull these out

00:01:18.160 --> 00:01:18.170 
and voila

00:01:18.170 --> 00:01:24.440 
and voila
the<00:01:19.170> tent<00:01:19.500> is<00:01:19.680> now<00:01:20.150> disassembled<00:01:22.880> now<00:01:23.880> you<00:01:24.060> go

00:01:24.440 --> 00:01:24.450 
the tent is now disassembled now you go

00:01:24.450 --> 00:01:27.950 
the tent is now disassembled now you go
through<00:01:24.659> the<00:01:24.750> usual<00:01:24.930> process<00:01:25.590> of<00:01:26.659> the<00:01:27.659> poles

00:01:27.950 --> 00:01:27.960 
through the usual process of the poles

00:01:27.960 --> 00:01:30.440 
through the usual process of the poles
you<00:01:28.409> see<00:01:29.369> when<00:01:29.520> the<00:01:29.610> poles<00:01:29.850> is<00:01:30.030> bent<00:01:30.270> there<00:01:30.420> a

00:01:30.440 --> 00:01:30.450 
you see when the poles is bent there a

00:01:30.450 --> 00:01:32.060 
you see when the poles is bent there a
little<00:01:30.570> bit<00:01:30.750> I'm<00:01:31.650> gonna<00:01:31.740> have<00:01:31.860> to<00:01:31.920> get<00:01:32.009> new

00:01:32.060 --> 00:01:32.070 
little bit I'm gonna have to get new

00:01:32.070 --> 00:01:36.140 
little bit I'm gonna have to get new
poles<00:01:32.430> so<00:01:32.790> I<00:01:33.030> was<00:01:33.810> I<00:01:34.079> think<00:01:34.950> somehow<00:01:35.460> they<00:01:36.030> got

00:01:36.140 --> 00:01:36.150 
poles so I was I think somehow they got

00:01:36.150 --> 00:01:39.080 
poles so I was I think somehow they got
bent<00:01:36.950> so<00:01:37.950> I<00:01:37.979> might<00:01:38.220> get<00:01:38.340> one<00:01:38.400> or<00:01:38.549> two<00:01:38.640> new<00:01:38.880> polls

00:01:39.080 --> 00:01:39.090 
bent so I might get one or two new polls

00:01:39.090 --> 00:01:44.319 
bent so I might get one or two new polls
so<00:01:39.420> we<00:01:39.509> take<00:01:39.659> that<00:01:39.810> pole<00:01:40.110> we<00:01:40.320> pull<00:01:40.560> it<00:01:40.619> apart

00:01:44.319 --> 00:01:44.329 

00:01:44.329 --> 00:01:49.450 

there<00:01:45.329> is<00:01:45.360> see<00:01:45.869> the<00:01:45.990> shock<00:01:46.200> shock<00:01:46.649> cord<00:01:47.689> okay

00:01:49.450 --> 00:01:49.460 
there is see the shock shock cord okay

00:01:49.460 --> 00:01:51.980 
there is see the shock shock cord okay
now<00:01:50.460> there's<00:01:50.700> a<00:01:50.759> there's<00:01:51.119> a<00:01:51.180> like<00:01:51.630> a<00:01:51.659> bungee

00:01:51.980 --> 00:01:51.990 
now there's a there's a like a bungee

00:01:51.990 --> 00:01:54.889 
now there's a there's a like a bungee
cord<00:01:52.020> inside<00:01:52.470> there<00:01:53.329> they<00:01:54.329> call<00:01:54.479> it<00:01:54.570> the<00:01:54.689> shock

00:01:54.889 --> 00:01:54.899 
cord inside there they call it the shock

00:01:54.899 --> 00:01:57.410 
cord inside there they call it the shock
cording<00:01:55.790> holds<00:01:56.790> the<00:01:56.880> aluminum<00:01:57.210> poles

00:01:57.410 --> 00:01:57.420 
cording holds the aluminum poles

00:01:57.420 --> 00:01:59.959 
cording holds the aluminum poles
together<00:01:58.219> and<00:01:59.219> they<00:01:59.310> go<00:01:59.460> together<00:01:59.610> like<00:01:59.939> that

00:01:59.959 --> 00:01:59.969 
together and they go together like that

00:01:59.969 --> 00:02:03.889 
together and they go together like that
and<00:02:02.000> there's<00:02:03.000> eight<00:02:03.210> sections<00:02:03.630> of<00:02:03.750> here<00:02:03.840> I

00:02:03.889 --> 00:02:03.899 
and there's eight sections of here I

00:02:03.899 --> 00:02:08.150 
and there's eight sections of here I
believe

00:02:08.150 --> 00:02:08.160 

00:02:08.160 --> 00:02:11.490 

you<00:02:09.160> pull<00:02:09.399> on<00:02:09.550> it<00:02:10.030> you<00:02:10.840> hold<00:02:11.050> the<00:02:11.170> ends<00:02:11.470> you

00:02:11.490 --> 00:02:11.500 
you pull on it you hold the ends you

00:02:11.500 --> 00:02:14.480 
you pull on it you hold the ends you
pull<00:02:11.830> on<00:02:11.980> it<00:02:12.010> in<00:02:12.250> there<00:02:12.600> there<00:02:13.600> like<00:02:13.720> that<00:02:13.959> you

00:02:14.480 --> 00:02:14.490 
pull on it in there there like that you

00:02:14.490 --> 00:02:18.090 
pull on it in there there like that you
know<00:02:15.490> so<00:02:15.670> like<00:02:15.760> normal<00:02:16.450> will<00:02:17.380> we'll<00:02:17.830> put<00:02:17.980> these

know so like normal will we'll put these

00:02:18.100 --> 00:02:19.320 
know so like normal will we'll put these
together<00:02:18.280> here<00:02:18.520> and<00:02:18.790> I'll<00:02:18.850> talk<00:02:19.060> more<00:02:19.270> about
