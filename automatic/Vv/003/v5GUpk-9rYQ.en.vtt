00:04:09.260 --> 00:04:12.069 
and possibly pvp so I'm really looking
forward<00:04:09.290> to<00:04:09.530> that<00:04:09.620> however<00:04:10.329> I'm<00:04:11.329> also<00:04:11.359> not

00:04:12.069 --> 00:04:12.079 
forward to that however I'm also not

00:04:12.079 --> 00:04:13.960 
forward to that however I'm also not
because<00:04:12.650> I<00:04:12.769> know<00:04:12.829> because<00:04:13.370> it's<00:04:13.609> bad<00:04:13.730> is<00:04:13.849> so

00:04:13.960 --> 00:04:13.970 
because I know because it's bad is so

00:04:13.970 --> 00:04:16.180 
because I know because it's bad is so
awesome<00:04:14.150> I'm<00:04:14.569> probably<00:04:15.409> going<00:04:15.739> to<00:04:15.829> end<00:04:15.859> up

00:04:16.180 --> 00:04:16.190 
awesome I'm probably going to end up

00:04:16.190 --> 00:04:18.279 
awesome I'm probably going to end up
using<00:04:16.909> this<00:04:17.150> pad<00:04:17.389> for<00:04:17.570> endgame<00:04:17.870> rating

00:04:18.279 --> 00:04:18.289 
using this pad for endgame rating

00:04:18.289 --> 00:04:20.319 
using this pad for endgame rating
because<00:04:18.560> we<00:04:18.859> the<00:04:19.130> raids<00:04:19.310> holy<00:04:19.489> go<00:04:19.609> tech<00:04:19.909> demand

00:04:20.319 --> 00:04:20.329 
because we the raids holy go tech demand

00:04:20.329 --> 00:04:22.270 
because we the raids holy go tech demand
this<00:04:20.539> pet<00:04:20.810> for<00:04:21.019> its<00:04:21.320> awesome<00:04:21.769> battle<00:04:22.070> rez

00:04:22.270 --> 00:04:22.280 
this pet for its awesome battle rez

00:04:22.280 --> 00:04:25.089 
this pet for its awesome battle rez
however<00:04:23.210> I<00:04:23.659> want<00:04:24.139> to<00:04:24.199> use<00:04:24.289> my<00:04:24.320> ooze<00:04:24.620> link<00:04:24.919> pet

however I want to use my ooze link pet

00:04:25.099 --> 00:04:27.159

so<00:04:25.370> most<00:04:25.639> likely<00:04:25.760> that<00:04:26.449> scenario<00:04:26.810> is<00:04:26.960> going<00:04:27.110> to

00:04:27.159 --> 00:04:27.169 
so most likely that scenario is going to

00:04:27.169 --> 00:04:30.670 
so most likely that scenario is going to
turn<00:04:27.289> into<00:04:27.349> something<00:04:27.710> like<00:04:27.949> this<00:04:29.409> xolo<00:04:30.409> we
