 earlier. 

00:01:08.820 --> 00:01:13.530
 that is, outside the city, someone can 

00:01:37.890 --> 00:01:44.670
 for example, because at least he can 

00:01:41.590 --> 00:01:44.670
 to call the police 

00:01:55.950 --> 00:01:58.950

 Now and also people X and the like 

00:02:39.070 --> 00:02:41.110
 that is, I was not fond of 

00:02:40.270 --> 00:02:45.070
 superheroes 

00:02:41.110 --> 00:02:48.330
 I didn't have video game cards I didn't 

00:02:45.070 --> 00:02:52.450
 watched every episode with the look of these 

00:02:48.330 --> 00:02:53.680
 characters are not up to the characters and I did not have 

00:02:52.450 --> 00:02:57.820
 t-shirts and 

00:02:53.680 --> 00:03:00.790
 2 toys with these superheroes so I'm in 

00:02:57.820 --> 00:03:03.090
 Well, so I used the information 

00:03:00.790 --> 00:03:05.440

00:03:03.090 --> 00:03:08.140

00:03:05.440 --> 00:03:10.660

00:03:11.440 --> 00:03:17.430
 elements of harmony and spike sucked so 

00:03:14.320 --> 00:03:20.730
 called comics where instead 

00:03:17.430 --> 00:03:23.860
 the cops work super heroes 

00:03:20.730 --> 00:03:27.190
 there are probably seven heroes in this comic 

00:03:23.860 --> 00:03:30.940
 rarity is the green lantern ages 

00:03:27.190 --> 00:03:33.360

 only sense even if you donâ€™t have 

00:04:09.500 --> 00:04:14.310
 superpowers this does not mean 

00:04:11.580 --> 00:04:14.959
 that you are some kind of garbage so bad 

00:04:14.310 --> 00:04:17.910
 comparison 

00:04:14.959 --> 00:04:20.400
 even if you are without superpowers this 

00:04:17.910 --> 00:04:22.169
 does not mean that you do not need either 

00:04:20.400 --> 00:04:25.560
 link even without superpowers you 

00:04:22.169 --> 00:04:27.900
 able to bring the benefits of a superhero well 

00:04:25.560 --> 00:04:31.260
 such as pizza they ordered has not yet been 

00:04:27.900 --> 00:04:34.919

00:04:31.260 --> 00:04:37.950
 grater striker from mortal kombat pancake 

00:04:34.919 --> 00:04:40.020
 half an hour to use this than usual 

00:04:37.950 --> 00:04:42.450
 a policeman who does not study magic 

00:04:40.020 --> 00:04:44.160

00:04:49.200 --> 00:04:52.490
 do some great thing at all 

00:04:51.150 --> 00:04:54.780
 not necessarily to have 

00:04:52.490 --> 00:04:57.450
 superpowers all you need is 

00:04:54.780 --> 00:04:59.850
 just moderation yourself yes even if so 

00:04:57.450 --> 00:05:01.380

00:04:59.850 --> 00:05:03.450
 have a super power 

00:05:01.380 --> 00:05:04.890

00:05:08.820 --> 00:05:11.940
 like 

00:05:09.390 --> 00:05:14.550
 the main thing is to understand how you have talent and 

00:05:11.940 --> 00:05:17.280
