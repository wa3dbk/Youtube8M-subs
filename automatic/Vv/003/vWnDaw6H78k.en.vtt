00:00:48.260 --> 00:00:48.270 
remembering something of the sort being

00:00:48.270 --> 00:00:50.960

in<00:00:48.570> a<00:00:49.050> pokemon<00:00:49.620> stadium<00:00:49.950> game<00:00:50.430> when<00:00:50.730> I<00:00:50.760> was

00:00:50.960 --> 00:00:50.970 
in a pokemon stadium game when I was

00:00:55.250 --> 00:00:55.260 
younger when I played it but I think

00:00:55.260 --> 00:00:57.770 
younger when I played it but I think
that<00:00:55.350> it<00:00:55.620> can<00:00:55.770> be<00:00:55.920> very<00:00:55.950> useful<00:00:56.280> to<00:00:57.060> use<00:00:57.270> so

00:02:15.980 --> 00:02:15.990 
with it or something like that like

00:02:15.990 --> 00:02:18.510 
with it or something like that like
generally<00:02:16.990> water<00:02:17.200> types<00:02:17.470> are<00:02:17.680> fairly<00:02:17.980> simple

00:02:18.510 --> 00:02:18.520 
generally water types are fairly simple

00:02:18.520 --> 00:02:21.330 
generally water types are fairly simple
to<00:02:18.580> predict<00:02:19.330> when<00:02:20.260> it<00:02:20.380> comes<00:02:20.590> to<00:02:20.800> what<00:02:21.010> kind<00:02:21.220> of

00:02:21.330 --> 00:02:21.340 
to predict when it comes to what kind of

00:02:21.340 --> 00:02:23.400 
to predict when it comes to what kind of
special<00:02:22.030> or<00:02:22.390> physical<00:02:22.840> moves<00:02:23.050> they're<00:02:23.230> going

00:02:23.400 --> 00:02:23.410 
special or physical moves they're going

00:02:23.410 --> 00:02:25.650 
special or physical moves they're going
to<00:02:23.500> have<00:02:23.670> so<00:02:24.670> that<00:02:25.090> gives<00:02:25.240> you<00:02:25.450> an<00:02:25.540> advantage

00:02:25.650 --> 00:02:25.660 
to have so that gives you an advantage

00:02:25.660 --> 00:02:27.390 
to have so that gives you an advantage
because<00:02:26.140> obviously<00:02:26.440> you<00:02:26.950> are<00:02:27.070> also<00:02:27.250> a

00:02:27.390 --> 00:02:27.400 
because obviously you are also a

00:02:27.400 --> 00:02:29.480 
because obviously you are also a
fighting<00:02:27.850> type<00:02:28.030> with<00:02:28.270> fighting-type<00:02:28.630> moves

00:02:29.480 --> 00:02:29.490 
fighting type with fighting-type moves

00:02:29.490 --> 00:02:32.430 
fighting type with fighting-type moves
so<00:02:30.490> in<00:02:30.700> that<00:02:30.850> situation<00:02:31.630> you'll<00:02:32.110> have<00:02:32.290> the

00:02:32.430 --> 00:02:32.440 
so in that situation you'll have the

00:02:32.440 --> 00:02:34.320 
so in that situation you'll have the
advantage<00:02:32.860> because<00:02:33.040> fighting<00:02:33.400> types<00:02:33.790> do

00:02:34.320 --> 00:02:34.330 
advantage because fighting types do

00:02:34.330 --> 00:02:37.950 
advantage because fighting types do
standard<00:02:34.840> against<00:02:35.080> other<00:02:35.260> water<00:02:35.500> types<00:02:36.960> now

00:02:37.950 --> 00:02:37.960 
standard against other water types now

00:02:37.960 --> 00:02:39.980 
standard against other water types now
for<00:02:38.170> the<00:02:38.230> EV<00:02:38.530> spread<00:02:38.800> which<00:02:39.010> is<00:02:39.190> fairly<00:02:39.610> simple

00:02:39.980 --> 00:02:39.990 
for the EV spread which is fairly simple

00:02:39.990 --> 00:02:43.020 
for the EV spread which is fairly simple
for<00:02:40.990> HPV<00:02:41.350> is<00:02:41.800> to<00:02:41.950> give<00:02:42.070> it<00:02:42.190> one<00:02:42.400> more<00:02:42.430> hit<00:02:42.760> point

00:02:43.020 --> 00:02:43.030 
for HPV is to give it one more hit point

00:02:43.030 --> 00:02:45.690 
for HPV is to give it one more hit point
to<00:02:43.660> 50<00:02:43.960> TVs<00:02:44.380> for<00:02:44.500> attack<00:02:44.860> to<00:02:45.100> max<00:02:45.400> out<00:02:45.550> its

00:02:45.690 --> 00:02:45.700 
to 50 TVs for attack to max out its

to 50 TVs for attack to max out its
attack<00:02:46.000> or<00:02:46.390> the<00:02:46.810> most<00:02:46.960> attack<00:02:47.260> it<00:02:47.410> can<00:02:47.530> have

00:02:47.640 --> 00:02:47.650 
attack or the most attack it can have

00:02:47.650 --> 00:02:51.440 
attack or the most attack it can have
with<00:02:47.890> a<00:02:47.920> jaya<00:02:48.220> and<00:02:48.760> then<00:02:49.600> 250<00:02:49.930> 2<00:02:50.260> v's<00:02:50.590> for<00:02:50.830> speed

00:02:51.440 --> 00:02:51.450 
with a jaya and then 250 2 v's for speed

00:02:51.450 --> 00:02:54.540 
with a jaya and then 250 2 v's for speed
now<00:02:52.450> poliwrath<00:02:53.350> really<00:02:53.680> isn't<00:02:54.010> the<00:02:54.130> fastest

00:02:54.540 --> 00:02:54.550 
now poliwrath really isn't the fastest

00:02:54.550 --> 00:02:58.110 
now poliwrath really isn't the fastest
Pokemon<00:02:55.030> and<00:02:55.590> it<00:02:56.590> still<00:02:57.130> won't<00:02:57.460> be<00:02:57.670> really

00:02:58.110 --> 00:02:58.120 
Pokemon and it still won't be really

00:02:58.120 --> 00:03:00.510 
Pokemon and it still won't be really
that<00:02:58.300> fast<00:02:58.570> even<00:02:59.110> with<00:02:59.140> all<00:02:59.560> these<00:02:59.770> speedy<00:03:00.310> vs

00:03:00.510 --> 00:03:00.520 
that fast even with all these speedy vs

00:03:00.520 --> 00:03:04.260 
that fast even with all these speedy vs
and<00:03:00.760> the<00:03:00.850> JH<00:03:01.330> er<00:03:01.560> but<00:03:02.560> it's<00:03:03.550> like<00:03:03.790> a<00:03:03.820> general

00:03:04.260 --> 00:03:04.270 
and the JH er but it's like a general

00:03:04.270 --> 00:03:06.840 
and the JH er but it's like a general
consensus<00:03:04.690> kind<00:03:05.380> of<00:03:05.530> thing<00:03:05.740> that<00:03:06.010> you<00:03:06.310> really

00:03:06.840 --> 00:03:06.850 
consensus kind of thing that you really

00:03:06.850 --> 00:03:09.450 
consensus kind of thing that you really
should<00:03:07.360> be<00:03:07.390> maxing<00:03:08.110> out<00:03:08.230> your<00:03:08.530> speed<00:03:09.280> on<00:03:09.430> a

00:03:09.450 --> 00:03:09.460 
should be maxing out your speed on a

00:03:09.460 --> 00:03:11.310 
should be maxing out your speed on a
Pokemon<00:03:09.970> that<00:03:10.180> you're<00:03:10.450> expecting<00:03:10.990> to<00:03:11.110> do<00:03:11.290> a

00:03:11.310 --> 00:03:11.320 
Pokemon that you're expecting to do a

00:03:11.320 --> 00:03:13.380 
Pokemon that you're expecting to do a
lot<00:03:11.620> of<00:03:11.680> damage<00:03:12.040> to<00:03:12.250> your<00:03:12.580> opponent<00:03:12.640> in<00:03:13.150> some

00:03:13.380 --> 00:03:13.390 
lot of damage to your opponent in some

00:03:13.390 --> 00:03:17.520 
lot of damage to your opponent in some
way<00:03:13.800> so<00:03:15.360> even<00:03:16.360> though<00:03:16.390> it<00:03:16.810> won't<00:03:16.960> be<00:03:17.170> out

00:03:17.520 --> 00:03:17.530 
way so even though it won't be out

00:03:17.530 --> 00:03:20.010 
way so even though it won't be out
speeding<00:03:18.100> many<00:03:18.490> major<00:03:19.060> threats<00:03:19.510> I<00:03:19.660> guess<00:03:19.870> you

00:03:20.010 --> 00:03:20.020 
speeding many major threats I guess you

00:03:20.020 --> 00:03:21.750 
speeding many major threats I guess you
could<00:03:20.050> say<00:03:20.410> that<00:03:20.440> are<00:03:20.800> normally<00:03:21.280> considered

00:03:21.750 --> 00:03:21.760 
could say that are normally considered

00:03:21.760 --> 00:03:24.750 
could say that are normally considered
sweeping<00:03:22.450> pokemon<00:03:23.170> and<00:03:23.470> and<00:03:23.680> you<00:03:24.130> you<00:03:24.370> you<00:03:24.580> or

00:03:24.750 --> 00:03:24.760 
sweeping pokemon and and you you you or

00:03:24.760 --> 00:03:26.880 
sweeping pokemon and and you you you or
even<00:03:25.120> owe<00:03:25.330> you<00:03:25.540> because<00:03:25.990> I<00:03:26.230> think<00:03:26.440> poliwrath

00:03:26.880 --> 00:03:26.890 
even owe you because I think poliwrath

00:03:26.890 --> 00:03:31.610 
even owe you because I think poliwrath
still<00:03:27.340> has<00:03:27.580> a<00:03:27.610> pretty<00:03:28.120> good<00:03:29.550> moveset<00:03:30.550> and

00:03:31.610 --> 00:03:31.620 
still has a pretty good moveset and

00:03:31.620 --> 00:03:34.050 
still has a pretty good moveset and
typing<00:03:32.620> to<00:03:32.890> work<00:03:33.130> well<00:03:33.400> in<00:03:33.640> a<00:03:33.880> no<00:03:34.000> you

00:03:34.050 --> 00:03:34.060 
typing to work well in a no you

00:03:34.060 --> 00:03:36.990 
typing to work well in a no you
environment<00:03:34.720> you<00:03:35.620> will<00:03:35.650> still<00:03:36.220> be<00:03:36.250> able<00:03:36.700> to

00:03:36.990 --> 00:03:37.000 
environment you will still be able to

00:03:37.000 --> 00:03:39.030 
environment you will still be able to
hopefully<00:03:37.300> get<00:03:37.660> an<00:03:37.780> advantage<00:03:38.110> with<00:03:38.770> your

00:03:39.030 --> 00:03:39.040 
hopefully get an advantage with your

00:03:39.040 --> 00:03:41.870 
hopefully get an advantage with your
move<00:03:39.220> set<00:03:39.520> and<00:03:39.760> you're<00:03:40.270> awesome<00:03:40.900> attack<00:03:41.200> power

00:03:41.870 --> 00:03:41.880 
move set and you're awesome attack power

00:03:41.880 --> 00:03:44.370 
move set and you're awesome attack power
and<00:03:42.880> that's<00:03:43.060> why<00:03:43.240> obviously<00:03:43.690> I<00:03:43.720> chose<00:03:43.960> life

00:03:44.370 --> 00:03:44.380 
and that's why obviously I chose life

00:03:44.380 --> 00:03:49.080 
and that's why obviously I chose life
orb<00:03:44.680> as<00:03:45.010> the<00:03:46.200> item<00:03:47.340> because<00:03:48.340> it<00:03:48.700> will<00:03:48.880> be

00:03:49.080 --> 00:03:49.090 
orb as the item because it will be

00:03:49.090 --> 00:03:51.660 
orb as the item because it will be
increasing<00:03:49.810> your<00:03:50.100> the<00:03:51.100> power<00:03:51.280> of<00:03:51.520> your

00:03:51.660 --> 00:03:51.670 
increasing your the power of your

00:03:51.670 --> 00:03:53.730 
increasing your the power of your
attacks<00:03:52.030> even<00:03:52.660> though<00:03:52.750> it<00:03:52.900> does<00:03:53.170> take<00:03:53.500> away

00:03:53.730 --> 00:03:53.740 
attacks even though it does take away

00:03:53.740 --> 00:03:57.630 
attacks even though it does take away

more<00:04:08.590> it's<00:04:09.370> always<00:04:09.490> a<00:04:09.640> good<00:04:09.850> thing<00:04:10.230> now<00:04:11.230> for

more it's always a good thing now for

more it's always a good thing now for
the<00:04:11.470> move<00:04:11.650> set<00:04:11.920> and<00:04:12.160> this<00:04:12.280> is<00:04:12.400> what<00:04:12.550> I<00:04:12.580> meant<00:04:12.910> by

00:04:13.050 --> 00:04:13.060 
the move set and this is what I meant by

00:04:13.060 --> 00:04:15.060 
the move set and this is what I meant by
old<00:04:13.330> school<00:04:13.630> because<00:04:13.840> I<00:04:14.080> swear<00:04:14.500> that<00:04:14.740> this<00:04:14.890> was

00:04:15.060 --> 00:04:15.070 
old school because I swear that this was

00:04:15.070 --> 00:04:19.380 
old school because I swear that this was
in<00:04:15.190> pokemon<00:04:15.610> stadium<00:04:17.010> there<00:04:18.010> is<00:04:18.280> a<00:04:18.390> mind

00:04:19.380 --> 00:04:19.390 
in pokemon stadium there is a mind

00:04:19.390 --> 00:04:21.420 
in pokemon stadium there is a mind
reader<00:04:19.510> as<00:04:19.989> the<00:04:20.320> center<00:04:20.620> I<00:04:20.650> guess<00:04:20.950> of<00:04:21.160> the<00:04:21.280> move

00:04:21.420 --> 00:04:21.430 
reader as the center I guess of the move

00:04:21.430 --> 00:04:24.420 
reader as the center I guess of the move
set<00:04:21.700> which<00:04:22.450> serves<00:04:22.810> two<00:04:23.140> functions<00:04:23.650> the

00:04:24.420 --> 00:04:24.430 
set which serves two functions the

00:04:24.430 --> 00:04:27.180 
set which serves two functions the
first<00:04:24.580> is<00:04:24.789> so<00:04:25.000> that<00:04:25.380> hypnosis<00:04:26.380> and<00:04:26.770> dynamic

00:04:27.180 --> 00:04:27.190 
first is so that hypnosis and dynamic

00:04:27.190 --> 00:04:28.710 
first is so that hypnosis and dynamic
punch<00:04:27.400> will<00:04:27.610> always<00:04:27.850> hit<00:04:28.060> no<00:04:28.270> matter<00:04:28.300> what

00:04:28.710 --> 00:04:28.720 
punch will always hit no matter what

00:04:28.720 --> 00:04:31.290 
punch will always hit no matter what
unless<00:04:29.139> your<00:04:29.289> opponent's<00:04:29.680> which<00:04:29.800> is<00:04:29.919> out<00:04:30.300> but

00:04:31.290 --> 00:04:31.300 
unless your opponent's which is out but

00:04:31.300 --> 00:04:33.090 
unless your opponent's which is out but
the<00:04:31.330> second<00:04:31.810> function<00:04:32.169> is<00:04:32.320> to<00:04:32.560> cause<00:04:32.590> your

00:04:33.090 --> 00:04:33.100 
the second function is to cause your

00:04:33.100 --> 00:04:37.010 
the second function is to cause your
opponent's<00:04:33.130> switch<00:04:33.789> out<00:04:34.110> because<00:04:35.110> they<00:04:35.620> will

00:04:37.010 --> 00:04:37.020 
opponent's switch out because they will

00:04:37.020 --> 00:04:39.840 
opponent's switch out because they will
expect<00:04:38.020> some<00:04:38.440> kind<00:04:38.650> of<00:04:38.830> really<00:04:39.130> powerful<00:04:39.610> move

00:04:39.840 --> 00:04:39.850 
expect some kind of really powerful move

00:04:39.850 --> 00:04:41.640 
expect some kind of really powerful move
and<00:04:40.210> they<00:04:40.270> might<00:04:40.449> even<00:04:40.570> like<00:04:41.110> just<00:04:41.350> predict

00:04:41.640 --> 00:04:41.650 
and they might even like just predict

00:04:41.650 --> 00:04:44.100 
and they might even like just predict
the<00:04:41.740> dynamic<00:04:42.220> punch<00:04:42.430> and<00:04:42.789> so<00:04:43.660> they'll<00:04:43.870> switch

00:04:44.100 --> 00:04:44.110 
the dynamic punch and so they'll switch

00:04:44.110 --> 00:04:47.460 
the dynamic punch and so they'll switch
out<00:04:44.320> and<00:04:44.590> take<00:04:45.370> damage<00:04:45.699> from<00:04:46.210> your<00:04:46.840> entry

00:04:47.460 --> 00:04:47.470 
out and take damage from your entry

00:04:47.470 --> 00:04:49.560 
out and take damage from your entry
hazards<00:04:47.889> that<00:04:48.190> you<00:04:48.340> will<00:04:48.880> have<00:04:49.000> on<00:04:49.150> the<00:04:49.240> fields

00:04:49.560 --> 00:04:49.570 
hazards that you will have on the fields

00:04:49.570 --> 00:04:51.810 
hazards that you will have on the fields
hopefully<00:04:49.930> I<00:04:49.960> don't<00:04:50.080> know<00:04:50.400> how<00:04:51.400> often<00:04:51.639> people

00:04:51.810 --> 00:04:51.820 
hopefully I don't know how often people

00:04:51.820 --> 00:04:53.610 
hopefully I don't know how often people
play<00:04:52.330> with<00:04:52.539> like<00:04:52.690> stealth<00:04:52.960> rocks<00:04:53.199> and<00:04:53.410> spikes

00:04:53.610 --> 00:04:53.620 
play with like stealth rocks and spikes

00:04:53.620 --> 00:04:55.469 
play with like stealth rocks and spikes
I<00:04:53.949> really<00:04:54.280> don't<00:04:54.490> like<00:04:54.699> to<00:04:55.000> use<00:04:55.030> them<00:04:55.360> because

00:04:55.469 --> 00:04:55.479 
I really don't like to use them because

00:04:55.479 --> 00:04:58.350 
I really don't like to use them because
of<00:04:55.630> just<00:04:55.840> wasted<00:04:56.259> turn<00:04:56.440> in<00:04:56.620> my<00:04:56.740> opinion<00:04:57.360> but

00:04:58.350 --> 00:04:58.360 
of just wasted turn in my opinion but

00:04:58.360 --> 00:05:01.620 
of just wasted turn in my opinion but
that's<00:04:58.690> just<00:04:58.780> mine<00:04:59.020> and<00:04:59.550> so<00:05:00.550> you<00:05:00.610> can<00:05:01.000> be<00:05:01.210> doing

00:05:01.620 --> 00:05:01.630 
that's just mine and so you can be doing

00:05:01.630 --> 00:05:05.100 
that's just mine and so you can be doing
added<00:05:01.990> damage<00:05:02.380> to<00:05:02.590> them<00:05:03.210> by<00:05:04.210> causing<00:05:04.720> switches

00:05:05.100 --> 00:05:05.110 
added damage to them by causing switches

00:05:05.110 --> 00:05:07.770 
added damage to them by causing switches
with<00:05:05.289> mind<00:05:05.590> reader<00:05:05.830> and<00:05:06.160> now<00:05:07.030> as<00:05:07.270> I<00:05:07.419> said<00:05:07.630> it

00:05:07.770 --> 00:05:07.780 
with mind reader and now as I said it

00:05:07.780 --> 00:05:09.839 
with mind reader and now as I said it
works<00:05:07.990> in<00:05:08.229> conjunction<00:05:08.470> with<00:05:08.889> hypnosis<00:05:09.520> and

00:05:09.839 --> 00:05:09.849 
works in conjunction with hypnosis and

00:05:09.849 --> 00:05:13.529 
works in conjunction with hypnosis and
dynamic<00:05:10.270> punch<00:05:11.520> hypnosis<00:05:12.520> is<00:05:12.729> obviously<00:05:13.330> to

00:05:13.529 --> 00:05:13.539 
dynamic punch hypnosis is obviously to

00:05:13.539 --> 00:05:16.290 
dynamic punch hypnosis is obviously to
put<00:05:13.720> your<00:05:13.900> opponent's<00:05:14.320> asleep<00:05:14.910> because<00:05:15.910> it

00:05:16.290 --> 00:05:16.300 
put your opponent's asleep because it

00:05:16.300 --> 00:05:18.629 
put your opponent's asleep because it
gives<00:05:16.449> you<00:05:16.660> a<00:05:16.720> guaranteed<00:05:17.349> sleep<00:05:17.800> like<00:05:18.160> sport

00:05:18.629 --> 00:05:18.639 
gives you a guaranteed sleep like sport

00:05:18.639 --> 00:05:23.279 
gives you a guaranteed sleep like sport
I<00:05:18.820> guess<00:05:19.060> but<00:05:19.509> in<00:05:19.690> two<00:05:19.870> moves<00:05:20.880> and<00:05:22.289> then

00:05:23.279 --> 00:05:23.289 
I guess but in two moves and then

00:05:23.289 --> 00:05:26.700 
I guess but in two moves and then
dynamic<00:05:24.220> punch<00:05:24.430> is<00:05:24.729> obviously<00:05:25.300> a<00:05:25.710> awesome

00:05:26.700 --> 00:05:26.710 
dynamic punch is obviously a awesome

00:05:26.710 --> 00:05:29.550 
dynamic punch is obviously a awesome
move<00:05:26.889> to<00:05:27.130> use<00:05:27.460> in<00:05:27.810> long<00:05:28.810> with<00:05:29.050> mind<00:05:29.320> reader

00:05:29.550 --> 00:05:29.560 
move to use in long with mind reader

00:05:29.560 --> 00:05:31.379 
move to use in long with mind reader
because<00:05:29.800> it's<00:05:30.159> fifty<00:05:30.580> percent<00:05:30.909> accuracy

00:05:31.379 --> 00:05:31.389 
because it's fifty percent accuracy

00:05:31.389 --> 00:05:33.719 
because it's fifty percent accuracy
which<00:05:31.720> is<00:05:31.870> probably<00:05:32.590> going<00:05:33.010> to<00:05:33.130> hit<00:05:33.340> all<00:05:33.550> the

00:05:33.719 --> 00:05:33.729 
which is probably going to hit all the

00:05:33.729 --> 00:05:35.939 
which is probably going to hit all the
time<00:05:33.940> I<00:05:34.210> mean<00:05:35.020> it<00:05:35.110> probably<00:05:35.380> isn't<00:05:35.500> going<00:05:35.770> to

00:05:35.939 --> 00:05:35.949 
time I mean it probably isn't going to

00:05:35.949 --> 00:05:40.409 
time I mean it probably isn't going to
hit<00:05:36.130> at<00:05:36.250> all<00:05:36.490> um<00:05:38.190> but<00:05:39.190> it<00:05:39.430> also<00:05:39.610> has<00:05:39.909> really

00:05:40.409 --> 00:05:40.419 
hit at all um but it also has really

00:05:40.419 --> 00:05:42.210 
hit at all um but it also has really
high<00:05:40.539> attack<00:05:40.900> power<00:05:41.169> I<00:05:41.320> think<00:05:41.650> it's<00:05:41.770> the<00:05:41.949> same

00:05:42.210 --> 00:05:42.220 
high attack power I think it's the same

00:05:42.220 --> 00:05:44.490 
high attack power I think it's the same
as<00:05:42.250> close<00:05:42.669> combat<00:05:43.199> and<00:05:44.199> it<00:05:44.349> also

00:05:44.490 --> 00:05:44.500 
as close combat and it also

00:05:44.500 --> 00:05:47.430 
as close combat and it also
automatically<00:05:45.280> confuses<00:05:46.090> when<00:05:46.270> it<00:05:46.360> hits<00:05:46.570> so

00:05:47.430 --> 00:05:47.440 
automatically confuses when it hits so

00:05:47.440 --> 00:05:49.589 
automatically confuses when it hits so
even<00:05:47.800> if<00:05:47.919> he<00:05:48.070> switches<00:05:48.460> into<00:05:48.789> something<00:05:49.300> that

00:05:49.589 --> 00:05:49.599 
even if he switches into something that

00:05:49.599 --> 00:05:53.310 
even if he switches into something that
I<00:05:49.979> mean<00:05:50.979> even<00:05:51.130> if<00:05:51.340> you<00:05:51.460> use<00:05:51.729> it<00:05:51.909> on<00:05:52.030> a<00:05:52.360> Pokemon

00:05:53.310 --> 00:05:53.320 
I mean even if you use it on a Pokemon

00:05:53.320 --> 00:05:54.899 
I mean even if you use it on a Pokemon
that<00:05:53.500> resists<00:05:54.099> it<00:05:54.250> or<00:05:54.490> it<00:05:54.610> could<00:05:54.759> potentially

00:05:54.899 --> 00:05:54.909 
that resists it or it could potentially

00:05:54.909 --> 00:05:57.120 
that resists it or it could potentially
hurt<00:05:55.479> you<00:05:55.659> you<00:05:55.900> can<00:05:56.050> still<00:05:56.259> get<00:05:56.380> the<00:05:56.530> confusion

00:05:57.120 --> 00:05:57.130 
hurt you you can still get the confusion

00:05:57.130 --> 00:05:59.180 
hurt you you can still get the confusion
off<00:05:57.250> if<00:05:57.490> you<00:05:57.580> want<00:05:57.699> to<00:05:57.849> play<00:05:58.030> risky<00:05:58.449> like<00:05:58.630> that

00:05:59.180 --> 00:05:59.190 
off if you want to play risky like that

00:05:59.190 --> 00:06:02.730 
off if you want to play risky like that
and<00:06:00.190> now<00:06:00.400> the<00:06:00.849> walk<00:06:01.300> or<00:06:01.630> move<00:06:01.659> waterfall<00:06:02.500> is

00:06:02.730 --> 00:06:02.740 
and now the walk or move waterfall is

00:06:02.740 --> 00:06:05.189 
and now the walk or move waterfall is
the<00:06:03.250> other<00:06:03.610> stab<00:06:04.060> move<00:06:04.330> to<00:06:04.539> use<00:06:04.720> along<00:06:05.020> with

00:06:05.189 --> 00:06:05.199 
the other stab move to use along with

00:06:05.199 --> 00:06:10.170 
the other stab move to use along with
the<00:06:05.320> set<00:06:05.620> and<00:06:06.270> it's<00:06:07.270> just<00:06:07.870> pretty<00:06:09.060> standard<00:06:10.060> I

00:06:10.170 --> 00:06:10.180 
the set and it's just pretty standard I

00:06:10.180 --> 00:06:12.749 
the set and it's just pretty standard I
guess<00:06:10.389> on<00:06:10.630> poly<00:06:10.870> rats<00:06:11.199> because<00:06:12.099> it's<00:06:12.639> a

00:06:12.749 --> 00:06:12.759 
guess on poly rats because it's a

00:06:12.759 --> 00:06:14.850 
guess on poly rats because it's a
physical<00:06:13.000> water<00:06:13.509> move<00:06:13.840> and<00:06:14.080> it<00:06:14.139> has<00:06:14.289> good

00:06:14.850 --> 00:06:14.860 
physical water move and it has good

00:06:31.900 --> 00:06:35.580 
want to risk using mind reader and then
getting<00:06:32.139> out<00:06:32.349> sped<00:06:32.740> and<00:06:33.010> being<00:06:34.349> killed<00:06:35.349> off<00:06:35.560> by

00:06:35.580 --> 00:06:35.590 
getting out sped and being killed off by

00:06:35.590 --> 00:06:37.290 
getting out sped and being killed off by
another<00:06:36.099> Pokemon<00:06:36.550> that<00:06:36.700> switch<00:06:36.880> is<00:06:36.909> in<00:06:37.150> or

00:06:37.290 --> 00:06:37.300 
another Pokemon that switch is in or

00:06:37.300 --> 00:06:38.219 
another Pokemon that switch is in or
something<00:06:37.599> like<00:06:37.690> that

00:06:38.219 --> 00:06:38.229 
something like that

00:06:38.229 --> 00:06:41.080 
something like that
so<00:06:39.229> that's<00:06:39.919> pretty<00:06:40.100> much<00:06:40.190> the<00:06:40.340> set<00:06:40.729> i<00:06:40.760> guess

00:06:41.080 --> 00:06:41.090 
so that's pretty much the set i guess

00:06:41.090 --> 00:06:45.189 
so that's pretty much the set i guess
and<00:06:41.360> it's<00:06:41.510> very<00:06:42.110> powerful<00:06:42.410> if<00:06:43.310> used<00:06:43.850> i<00:06:44.270> mean<00:06:45.110> if

00:06:45.189 --> 00:06:45.199 
and it's very powerful if used i mean if

00:06:45.199 --> 00:06:47.950 
and it's very powerful if used i mean if
you<00:06:45.290> can<00:06:45.440> predict<00:06:45.770> correctly<00:06:45.949> and<00:06:46.690> use<00:06:47.690> your

00:06:47.950 --> 00:06:47.960 
you can predict correctly and use your

00:06:47.960 --> 00:06:50.980 
you can predict correctly and use your
moves<00:06:48.229> to<00:06:48.470> their<00:06:48.590> advantage<00:06:48.800> obviously<00:06:49.600> so<00:06:50.600> i

00:06:50.980 --> 00:06:50.990 
moves to their advantage obviously so i

00:06:50.990 --> 00:06:52.930 
moves to their advantage obviously so i
