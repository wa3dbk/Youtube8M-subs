00:00:00.029 --> 00:00:03.390
 in the series a core the earlier improvements and 3m 

00:00:03.390 --> 00:00:07.100
 The brokerage association called on the banks to be well behind that again 

00:00:07.100 --> 00:00:09.469
 with mortgages 

00:00:09.469 --> 00:00:12.749
 do you provide that on mortgage products become stricter 

00:00:12.749 --> 00:00:16.029
 You notice that the people who bought Moscow have made things easier 

00:00:16.029 --> 00:00:18.769
 hiding places that heard something more cautious 

00:00:18.769 --> 00:00:23.489
 from all sides as it looks in perspective and I you 81 we had him 

00:00:23.489 --> 00:00:25.720
 hundreds of houses per year 

00:00:25.720 --> 00:00:29.449
 when there had fallen prices of madoff houses that print and terraces 11 

00:00:29.449 --> 00:00:30.589
 per cent 

00:00:30.589 --> 00:00:34.190
 this means that it is not quite stable, there is a fine 6 percent 

00:00:34.190 --> 00:00:36.340
 also remains fairly stable, we think 

00:00:36.340 --> 00:00:40.360
 And we think it is temporary that the housing market is taught that 

00:00:40.360 --> 00:00:44.080
 but I notice the court in Amsterdam that house prices are also rising in others 

00:00:44.080 --> 00:00:47.950
 regions to get a bicycle so I think this year and next year the 

00:00:47.950 --> 00:00:49.770
 house prices remain the studio 

00:00:49.770 --> 00:00:53.360
 Mortgage interest rate fairly stable the chip lead strength that dies once 

00:00:53.880 --> 00:00:57.740
 I also think it is wise for people to give advice that they are not going 

00:00:57.740 --> 00:01:01.330
 namely, to take out the subscription, but just ten or fifteen years for it 

00:01:01.330 --> 00:01:04.210
 a bit now I already know in that Monday to pay 

00:01:04.210 --> 00:01:05.940
 also pay for two years 

00:01:05.940 --> 00:01:10.070
 the I find those people who are here tonight against decisiveness the cost of the 

00:01:10.070 --> 00:01:13.440
 Rabobank the devices by these banks stricter as people request a mortgage 

00:01:13.440 --> 00:01:14.110
 about 

00:01:14.110 --> 00:01:16.790
 well we have been relatively strict outside 

00:01:16.790 --> 00:01:19.410
 it's been a few years ago that one 

00:01:19.410 --> 00:01:22.250
 a request from the minister of finance code of conduct on mortgages 

00:01:22.250 --> 00:01:24.370
 agreed 

00:01:24.370 --> 00:01:27.770
 with the goal of being more afraid of politics that people in between 

00:01:27.770 --> 00:01:30.020
 debts would come 

00:01:30.020 --> 00:01:33.210
 in most banks, and we do that too 

00:01:34.450 --> 00:01:37.770
 our policy has not changed significantly in recent times 9 

00:01:37.770 --> 00:01:38.840
 try the freezer 

00:01:38.840 --> 00:01:42.150
 gerry rafferty iris time do you think the house prices go with it in the netherlands 

00:01:42.150 --> 00:01:43.580
 due to the crisis 

00:01:43.580 --> 00:01:45.390
 I think so 

00:01:45.390 --> 00:01:46.960
 by all here 

00:01:46.960 --> 00:01:50.970
 whole optimistic stories from brussels should further pressure those mortgages 

00:01:50.970 --> 00:01:52.689
 do sell what is what is your story 

00:01:52.689 --> 00:01:57.509
 no but the broad economy and throughout the world going into feeling the effects of 

00:01:57.509 --> 00:01:59.789
 the banking crisis even though it is now being sworn 

00:01:59.789 --> 00:02:02.270
 that was by and that has 

00:02:02.270 --> 00:02:05.820
 That can certainly have an effect on house prices in the coming year 

00:02:05.820 --> 00:02:08.199
 use trainer 

00:02:08.199 --> 00:02:11.839
 well that has to do with many percentages what do you think i would like to leave 

00:02:11.839 --> 00:02:14.769
 to specialists about I think it is not too bad 

00:02:14.769 --> 00:02:16.989
 what in the Netherlands went as much as 80 percent 

00:02:16.989 --> 00:02:18.699
 is it funded for many years 

00:02:18.699 --> 00:02:22.129
 the city center has 15 year old mortgages it is very wise 

00:02:22.129 --> 00:02:23.909
 time 

00:02:23.909 --> 00:02:26.219
 this can be a collision i think more of that 

00:02:26.219 --> 00:02:29.870
 The excitement of those housing market alves no longer has to fight for one 

00:02:29.869 --> 00:02:30.519
 home 

00:02:30.519 --> 00:02:33.479
 and when i also look at the banks that fought one 

00:02:33.479 --> 00:02:36.909
 in two years ago, the margin on the mortgage was always lower 

00:02:36.909 --> 00:02:39.779
 who is who has become bigger and if you now see that there 

00:02:39.779 --> 00:02:42.799
 when the first drop in has started 

00:02:42.799 --> 00:02:46.629
 if you compare that with 3 about 3 percent inflation then it's a real one 

00:02:46.629 --> 00:02:48.819
 terms is that all depreciation if there is still 

00:02:48.819 --> 00:02:52.069
 I think it can still fall between 0 and 5 percent 

00:02:52.069 --> 00:02:55.179
 well it is that compares with inflation a little over two years 

00:02:55.179 --> 00:02:58.779
 14 percent and real terms have deteriorated there are plenty of people going 

00:02:58.779 --> 00:03:01.789
 ensure people with an investment mortgage will partially release you 

00:03:01.789 --> 00:03:04.990
 I have to see things like this in the long term and I don't think that one 

00:03:04.990 --> 00:03:09.880
 indeed who takes out a mortgage the class that can pay well that you have 

00:03:09.880 --> 00:03:11.379
 none at all the problem 

00:03:11.379 --> 00:03:15.980
 because in ten years' time left over in the long term is just a good feeling 

00:03:15.980 --> 00:03:16.880
 give that 

00:03:16.880 --> 00:03:19.709
 correct the bike what exactly is in the early eighties 

00:03:19.709 --> 00:03:23.599
 and at the end of the seventies was a huge decline and so not included now 

00:03:23.599 --> 00:03:26.840
 but good is always all in all I am satisfied 

00:03:26.840 --> 00:03:30.270
 last year again boonstra but many people naturally want them too 

00:03:30.269 --> 00:03:30.759
 as 

00:03:30.759 --> 00:03:34.589
 Some kind of the ATM machine are there to draw a line on it 

00:03:34.589 --> 00:03:36.529
 the shortage was meant to live in 

00:03:36.529 --> 00:03:39.729
 and not to create extra money, they have the legal basis for this 

00:03:39.729 --> 00:03:42.280
 comment to live there looking at home is always to live in 

00:03:42.280 --> 00:03:45.930
 and and even despite the fact that they actually save people quite a bit of money 

00:03:45.930 --> 00:03:47.169
 have settled 

00:03:47.169 --> 00:03:49.219
 to do other things than the other 

00:03:49.219 --> 00:03:53.150
 home improvement is still such that on average worth the 

00:03:53.149 --> 00:03:56.639
 home is about thirty forty percent higher than the value of that party 

00:03:57.439 --> 00:04:00.179
 so it is absolutely not that 

00:04:00.179 --> 00:04:04.349
 that there is a huge debt burden to a small amount of noise 

00:04:04.349 --> 00:04:08.239
 i want to be my life reacted stand out in the freeze member 

00:04:08.239 --> 00:04:12.259
 In the early 1980s, the Netherlands indeed had a very strong crisis on the 

00:04:12.259 --> 00:04:13.339
 had a housing market 

00:04:13.339 --> 00:04:16.759
 and actually it happened then in the Netherlands that now happened in America said 

00:04:16.759 --> 00:04:19.900
 anyone that variable interest themselves record webber and two webber 

00:04:19.900 --> 00:04:23.979
 credited and we no longer have all those announcements that is exactly what this one is 

00:04:23.979 --> 00:04:26.879
 Once deployed most people have been stuck in interest for years
