golden golden ARX so the air x 160 in

00:00:50.910 --> 00:00:53.240 
golden golden ARX so the air x 160 in
its<00:00:51.300> own<00:00:51.449> right<00:00:51.629> is<00:00:51.809> a<00:00:51.840> very<00:00:52.289> underused<00:00:52.949> gun

00:00:53.240 --> 00:00:53.250 
its own right is a very underused gun

00:00:53.250 --> 00:00:55.220 
its own right is a very underused gun
it's<00:00:53.430> a<00:00:53.520> very<00:00:53.699> unique<00:00:53.879> gun<00:00:54.329> I<00:00:54.510> love<00:00:54.899> the<00:00:55.079> gun

00:00:55.220 --> 00:00:55.230 
it's a very unique gun I love the gun

00:00:55.230 --> 00:00:57.290 
it's a very unique gun I love the gun
itself<00:00:55.590> but<00:00:56.010> it's<00:00:56.100> very<00:00:56.340> underused<00:00:56.940> across

00:00:57.290 --> 00:00:57.300 
itself but it's very underused across

00:00:57.300 --> 00:00:59.060 
itself but it's very underused across
the<00:00:57.449> board<00:00:57.690> it's<00:00:57.899> a<00:00:57.960> very<00:00:58.170> last<00:00:58.379> assault<00:00:58.770> rifle

00:00:59.060 --> 00:00:59.070 
the board it's a very last assault rifle

00:00:59.070 --> 00:01:00.650 
the board it's a very last assault rifle
in<00:00:59.160> the<00:00:59.250> assault<00:00:59.520> rifle<00:00:59.789> list<00:01:00.000> so<00:01:00.449> you<00:01:00.510> would

00:01:00.650 --> 00:01:00.660 
in the assault rifle list so you would

00:01:00.660 --> 00:01:02.119 
in the assault rifle list so you would
think<00:01:00.690> it'd<00:01:01.050> be<00:01:01.079> a<00:01:01.170> very<00:01:01.260> good<00:01:01.530> gun<00:01:01.890> but<00:01:02.039> it's

00:01:02.119 --> 00:01:02.129 
think it'd be a very good gun but it's

00:01:02.129 --> 00:01:04.880 
think it'd be a very good gun but it's
really<00:01:02.280> not<00:01:02.489> the<00:01:02.550> greatest<00:01:03.000> of<00:01:03.059> guns<00:01:03.300> it's<00:01:03.890> my

00:01:04.880 --> 00:01:04.890 
really not the greatest of guns it's my

00:01:04.890 --> 00:01:07.370 
really not the greatest of guns it's my
cases<00:01:05.339> is<00:01:05.430> an<00:01:05.549> average<00:01:06.030> assault<00:01:06.390> rifle<00:01:06.720> and<00:01:06.900> it

00:01:07.370 --> 00:01:07.380 
cases is an average assault rifle and it

00:01:07.380 --> 00:01:09.050 
cases is an average assault rifle and it
doesn't<00:01:07.680> perform<00:01:07.770> as<00:01:08.070> well<00:01:08.280> as<00:01:08.460> say<00:01:08.729> a<00:01:08.760> honey

00:01:09.050 --> 00:01:09.060 
doesn't perform as well as say a honey

00:01:09.060 --> 00:01:11.780 
doesn't perform as well as say a honey
badger<00:01:09.240> or<00:01:09.659> Remington<00:01:10.080> r5<00:01:10.229> or<00:01:10.770> an<00:01:10.860> MSBs<00:01:11.369> even

00:01:11.780 --> 00:01:11.790 
badger or Remington r5 or an MSBs even

00:01:11.790 --> 00:01:14.179 
badger or Remington r5 or an MSBs even
after<00:01:12.119> the<00:01:12.240> MSBs<00:01:12.689> nerf<00:01:13.020> it's<00:01:13.560> not<00:01:13.799> as<00:01:13.920> good<00:01:14.100> as

00:01:14.179 --> 00:01:14.189 
after the MSBs nerf it's not as good as

00:01:14.189 --> 00:01:15.950 
after the MSBs nerf it's not as good as
a<00:01:14.250> lot<00:01:14.430> of<00:01:14.460> different<00:01:14.760> rifles<00:01:15.030> the<00:01:15.119> sc-2010<00:01:15.450> is

00:01:15.950 --> 00:01:15.960 
a lot of different rifles the sc-2010 is

00:01:15.960 --> 00:01:17.810 
a lot of different rifles the sc-2010 is
a<00:01:15.990> laser<00:01:16.380> gun<00:01:16.710> compared<00:01:17.159> to<00:01:17.250> this<00:01:17.369> thing<00:01:17.610> so

00:01:17.810 --> 00:01:17.820 
a laser gun compared to this thing so

00:01:17.820 --> 00:01:20.149 
a laser gun compared to this thing so
not<00:01:18.420> a<00:01:18.450> lot<00:01:18.600> of<00:01:18.630> people<00:01:18.930> use<00:01:19.140> it<00:01:19.350> so<00:01:19.799> to<00:01:19.950> take<00:01:20.130> a

00:01:20.149 --> 00:01:20.159

00:01:36.140 --> 00:01:36.150 
fact that the gameplay itself is

00:01:36.150 --> 00:01:37.969

the<00:02:07.890> Kem<00:02:08.220> strike<00:02:08.310> goes<00:02:08.610> off<00:02:08.819> the<00:02:09.179> map<00:02:09.390> blows<00:02:09.690> up

00:02:09.889 --> 00:02:09.899 
the Kem strike goes off the map blows up

00:02:09.899 --> 00:02:11.839 
the Kem strike goes off the map blows up
and<00:02:10.050> the<00:02:10.140> map<00:02:10.319> changes<00:02:10.349> drastically<00:02:11.129> in<00:02:11.700> terms

00:02:11.839 --> 00:02:11.849 
and the map changes drastically in terms

00:02:11.849 --> 00:02:13.250 
and the map changes drastically in terms
of<00:02:12.030> its<00:02:12.150> appearance<00:02:12.390> it<00:02:12.599> plays<00:02:12.810> pretty

00:02:13.250 --> 00:02:13.260 
of its appearance it plays pretty

00:02:13.260 --> 00:02:13.670 
of its appearance it plays pretty
similar

00:02:13.670 --> 00:02:13.680 
similar

00:02:13.680 --> 00:02:15.559 
similar
but<00:02:14.099> it<00:02:14.159> doesn't<00:02:14.489> play<00:02:14.700> exactly<00:02:15.269> the<00:02:15.390> same

00:02:15.559 --> 00:02:15.569 
but it doesn't play exactly the same

00:02:15.569 --> 00:02:17.089 
but it doesn't play exactly the same
it's<00:02:15.780> definitely<00:02:16.530> different<00:02:16.859> definitely

00:02:17.089 --> 00:02:17.099 
it's definitely different definitely

00:02:17.099 --> 00:02:18.530 
it's definitely different definitely
notice<00:02:17.430> will<00:02:17.579> different<00:02:17.909> how<00:02:18.030> people<00:02:18.359> play

00:02:18.530 --> 00:02:18.540 
notice will different how people play

00:02:18.540 --> 00:02:20.899 
notice will different how people play
and<00:02:18.900> how<00:02:19.049> the<00:02:19.079> map<00:02:19.349> itself<00:02:19.709> feels<00:02:19.950> and<00:02:20.280> so<00:02:20.730> when

00:02:20.899 --> 00:02:20.909 
and how the map itself feels and so when

00:02:20.909 --> 00:02:22.099
