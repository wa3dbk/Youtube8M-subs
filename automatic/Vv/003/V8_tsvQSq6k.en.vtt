it<00:00:27.360> so<00:00:27.660> that<00:00:27.810> the<00:00:27.960> core<00:00:28.170> plugs<00:00:28.439> wouldn't<00:00:28.770> pop

00:00:28.940 --> 00:00:28.950 
it so that the core plugs wouldn't pop

you have to do to get the block stand up
the<00:01:05.940> tap<00:01:06.180> that<00:01:06.210> we're<00:01:06.450> going<00:01:06.570> to<00:01:06.659> use<00:01:06.810> is<00:01:07.080> an

00:01:07.219 --> 00:01:07.229 
the tap that we're going to use is an

00:01:07.229 --> 00:01:10.670 
the tap that we're going to use is an
inch<00:01:07.409> and<00:01:07.590> a<00:01:07.620> half<00:01:07.650> pipe<00:01:08.580> plug<00:01:08.820> cap<00:01:09.350> and<00:01:10.350> this

00:01:10.670 --> 00:01:10.680 
inch and a half pipe plug cap and this

00:01:10.680 --> 00:01:14.480 
inch and a half pipe plug cap and this
is<00:01:10.890> what<00:01:11.100> the<00:01:11.310> pug<00:01:12.150> looks<00:01:12.510> like<00:01:12.720> it<00:01:13.110> goes<00:01:13.290> in<00:01:13.590> to

00:01:14.480 --> 00:01:14.490 
is what the pug looks like it goes in to

00:01:14.490 --> 00:01:18.170 
is what the pug looks like it goes in to
fill<00:01:14.670> up<00:01:14.790> the<00:01:14.880> hole<00:01:16.400> now<00:01:17.400> you<00:01:17.460> have<00:01:17.670> to<00:01:17.820> be<00:01:17.940> kind

00:01:18.170 --> 00:01:18.180 
fill up the hole now you have to be kind

00:01:18.180 --> 00:01:20.330 
fill up the hole now you have to be kind
of<00:01:18.210> careful<00:01:18.420> because<00:01:19.010> sometimes<00:01:20.010> there's<00:01:20.190> not

00:01:20.330 --> 00:01:20.340 
of careful because sometimes there's not

00:01:20.340 --> 00:01:22.910 
of careful because sometimes there's not
a<00:01:20.370> lot<00:01:20.580> of<00:01:20.610> room<00:01:20.820> down<00:01:20.970> here<00:01:21.360> to<00:01:22.110> actually<00:01:22.590> run

00:01:22.910 --> 00:01:22.920 
a lot of room down here to actually run

00:01:22.920 --> 00:01:25.190 
a lot of room down here to actually run
the<00:01:22.980> tap<00:01:23.280> all<00:01:23.490> the<00:01:23.610> way<00:01:23.700> down<00:01:23.910> on<00:01:24.210> this<00:01:25.140> side

00:01:25.190 --> 00:01:25.200 
the tap all the way down on this side

00:01:25.200 --> 00:01:26.690 
the tap all the way down on this side
here<00:01:25.770> I<00:01:25.800> believe<00:01:26.010> we're<00:01:26.160> going<00:01:26.250> to<00:01:26.310> have<00:01:26.400> to

00:01:26.690 --> 00:01:26.700 
here I believe we're going to have to

00:01:26.700 --> 00:01:29.390 
here I believe we're going to have to
cut<00:01:27.420> the<00:01:27.540> tap<00:01:27.780> a<00:01:27.810> little<00:01:27.960> bit<00:01:28.230> on<00:01:28.860> the<00:01:28.980> second

00:01:29.390 --> 00:01:29.400 
cut the tap a little bit on the second

00:01:29.400 --> 00:01:32.060 
cut the tap a little bit on the second
pass<00:01:29.640> so<00:01:29.970> that'll<00:01:30.210> go<00:01:30.330> down<00:01:30.500> deep<00:01:31.500> enough<00:01:31.860> so

00:01:32.060 --> 00:01:32.070 
pass so that'll go down deep enough so

00:01:32.070 --> 00:01:33.710 
pass so that'll go down deep enough so
that<00:01:32.280> our<00:01:32.460> plug<00:01:32.820> will<00:01:33.000> go<00:01:33.150> into<00:01:33.360> the<00:01:33.480> correct

00:01:33.710 --> 00:01:33.720 
that our plug will go into the correct

00:01:33.720 --> 00:01:36.950 
that our plug will go into the correct
depth<00:01:35.090> one<00:01:36.090> of<00:01:36.180> the<00:01:36.240> reasons<00:01:36.510> this<00:01:36.600> needs<00:01:36.870> to

00:01:36.950 --> 00:01:36.960 
depth one of the reasons this needs to

00:01:36.960 --> 00:01:38.780 
depth one of the reasons this needs to
be<00:01:37.050> done<00:01:37.260> on<00:01:37.410> the<00:01:37.530> mill<00:01:37.710> is<00:01:38.010> so<00:01:38.400> that<00:01:38.550> we<00:01:38.640> can

00:01:38.780 --> 00:01:38.790 
be done on the mill is so that we can

00:01:38.790 --> 00:01:44.780 
be done on the mill is so that we can
align<00:01:39.150> the<00:01:40.520> tap<00:01:41.520> and<00:01:42.150> we<00:01:42.510> do<00:01:42.630> that<00:01:43.580> again<00:01:44.580> with

00:01:44.780 --> 00:01:44.790 
align the tap and we do that again with

00:01:44.790 --> 00:01:48.080 
align the tap and we do that again with
a<00:01:44.820> special<00:01:45.660> efficiency<00:01:46.050> that<00:01:46.170> I've<00:01:46.290> made<00:01:47.090> and

00:01:48.080 --> 00:01:48.090 
a special efficiency that I've made and

00:01:48.090 --> 00:01:51.710 
a special efficiency that I've made and
it<00:01:48.210> just<00:01:48.420> goes<00:01:48.630> down<00:01:48.840> in<00:01:49.200> the<00:01:49.920> hole<00:01:50.820> and<00:01:51.150> now

00:01:51.710 --> 00:01:51.720 
it just goes down in the hole and now

00:01:51.720 --> 00:01:52.970 
it just goes down in the hole and now
we'll<00:01:51.900> be<00:01:51.990> able<00:01:52.050> to<00:01:52.170> go<00:01:52.290> ahead<00:01:52.380> and<00:01:52.590> tap<00:01:52.710> this

00:01:52.970 --> 00:01:52.980 
we'll be able to go ahead and tap this

00:01:52.980 --> 00:01:57.830 
we'll be able to go ahead and tap this
out<00:01:55.700> first<00:01:56.700> thing<00:01:56.880> we<00:01:56.970> want<00:01:57.090> to<00:01:57.150> do<00:01:57.300> is<00:01:57.570> put

00:01:57.830 --> 00:01:57.840 
out first thing we want to do is put

00:01:57.840 --> 00:02:02.870 
out first thing we want to do is put
some<00:01:58.550> oil<00:01:59.550> on<00:01:59.970> our<00:02:00.570> tap<00:02:01.460> so<00:02:02.460> they'll<00:02:02.700> make

00:02:02.870 --> 00:02:02.880 
some oil on our tap so they'll make

00:02:02.880 --> 00:02:07.210 
some oil on our tap so they'll make
cutting<00:02:03.210> threads<00:02:03.510> much<00:02:03.840> easier

00:02:07.210 --> 00:02:07.220 

00:02:07.220 --> 00:02:12.270 

I'm<00:02:07.490> gonna<00:02:07.730> use<00:02:08.000> our<00:02:08.149> crescent<00:02:08.630> wrench<00:02:08.750> a

00:02:12.270 --> 00:02:12.280 

00:02:12.280 --> 00:02:17.860 

little<00:02:13.280> bit<00:02:13.370> of<00:02:13.460> downward<00:02:13.640> pressure<00:02:16.600> quill<00:02:17.600> to

00:02:17.860 --> 00:02:17.870 
little bit of downward pressure quill to

00:02:17.870 --> 00:02:45.340 
little bit of downward pressure quill to
hold<00:02:18.260> the<00:02:18.970> tap<00:02:20.920> square<00:02:21.920> to<00:02:22.190> the<00:02:22.310> block<00:02:44.350> back

00:02:45.340 --> 00:02:45.350 
hold the tap square to the block back

00:02:45.350 --> 00:03:20.020 
hold the tap square to the block back
this<00:02:45.620> out<00:02:51.580> we'll<00:02:52.580> check<00:02:52.790> and<00:02:52.910> see<00:03:18.790> this<00:03:19.790> should

00:03:20.020 --> 00:03:20.030 
this out we'll check and see this should
