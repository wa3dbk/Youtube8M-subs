00:00:52.270 --> 00:00:52.280 
2012 is the tone hammer 350 what's

00:00:52.280 --> 00:00:54.190 
2012 is the tone hammer 350 what's
special<00:00:52.460> about<00:00:52.640> this<00:00:52.910> amplifier<00:00:53.510> is<00:00:53.990> that

00:00:54.190 --> 00:00:54.200 
special about this amplifier is that

00:00:54.200 --> 00:00:56.740 
special about this amplifier is that
it's<00:00:54.320> super<00:00:54.650> lightweight<00:00:55.090> but<00:00:56.090> it<00:00:56.360> doesn't

00:00:56.740 --> 00:00:56.750 
it's super lightweight but it doesn't

00:00:56.750 --> 00:00:58.510 
it's super lightweight but it doesn't
sound<00:00:56.960> like<00:00:57.140> a<00:00:57.170> lightweight<00:00:57.440> amp<00:00:57.890> that's<00:00:58.340> why

00:00:58.510 --> 00:00:58.520 
sound like a lightweight amp that's why

00:00:58.520 --> 00:01:00.580 
sound like a lightweight amp that's why
we<00:00:58.700> call<00:00:58.910> it<00:00:59.060> the<00:00:59.180> light<00:00:59.360> heavyweight<00:00:59.750> an

00:01:00.580 --> 00:01:00.590 
we call it the light heavyweight an

00:01:00.590 --> 00:01:03.400 
we call it the light heavyweight an
amplifier<00:01:01.160> that's<00:01:01.850> light<00:01:02.270> but<00:01:02.750> thinks<00:01:03.170> it's<00:01:03.290> a

00:01:03.400 --> 00:01:03.410 
amplifier that's light but thinks it's a

00:01:03.410 --> 00:01:07.060 
amplifier that's light but thinks it's a
