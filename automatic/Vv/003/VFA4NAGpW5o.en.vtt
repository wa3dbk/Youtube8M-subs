how to properly pronounce that related

00:00:59.789 --> 00:01:01.580 
how to properly pronounce that related
and<00:00:59.940> I<00:00:59.969> thought<00:01:00.210> oh<00:01:00.420> I<00:01:00.840> want<00:01:01.170> a<00:01:01.230> bed<00:01:01.410> that's

00:01:01.590 --> 00:01:04.670 
and I thought oh I want a bed that's
like<00:01:01.859> this<00:01:02.100> but<00:01:02.370> with<00:01:02.579> totoro<00:01:03.000> now<00:01:03.750> maybe<00:01:04.140> you

00:01:04.670 --> 00:01:04.680 
like this but with totoro now maybe you

00:01:04.680 --> 00:01:05.870 
like this but with totoro now maybe you
have<00:01:04.799> no<00:01:04.979> idea<00:01:05.250> what<00:01:05.369> I'm<00:01:05.400> talking<00:01:05.489> about

00:01:05.870 --> 00:01:05.880 
have no idea what I'm talking about

00:01:05.880 --> 00:01:07.760 
have no idea what I'm talking about
because<00:01:06.150> it's<00:01:06.510> not<00:01:06.659> Nintendo<00:01:06.869> or<00:01:07.290> video<00:01:07.530> game

00:01:07.760 --> 00:01:07.770 
because it's not Nintendo or video game

00:01:07.770 --> 00:01:09.710 
because it's not Nintendo or video game
related<00:01:08.100> but<00:01:08.430> you<00:01:08.549> probably<00:01:08.760> do<00:01:09.240> those<00:01:09.450> things

00:01:09.710 --> 00:01:09.720 
related but you probably do those things

00:01:09.720 --> 00:01:12.070 
related but you probably do those things
I<00:01:09.990> bet<00:01:10.380> there's<00:01:10.590> a<00:01:10.650> Venn<00:01:10.890> diagram<00:01:10.920> that<00:01:11.880> shows

00:01:12.070 --> 00:01:12.080 
I bet there's a Venn diagram that shows

00:01:12.080 --> 00:01:16.039 
I bet there's a Venn diagram that shows
where<00:01:13.080> the<00:01:13.409> video<00:01:13.799> game<00:01:14.040> fans<00:01:14.400> and<00:01:14.850> the<00:01:15.090> Totoro

00:01:16.039 --> 00:01:16.049 
where the video game fans and the Totoro

00:01:16.049 --> 00:01:18.859 
where the video game fans and the Totoro
fans<00:01:16.850> the<00:01:17.850> circles<00:01:18.270> are<00:01:18.450> probably

00:01:18.859 --> 00:01:18.869 
fans the circles are probably

00:01:18.869 --> 00:01:20.330 
fans the circles are probably
overlapping<00:01:19.530> each<00:01:19.890> other<00:01:20.040> completely

00:01:20.330 --> 00:01:20.340 
overlapping each other completely

00:01:20.340 --> 00:01:23.510 
overlapping each other completely
because<00:01:21.210> you<00:01:22.110> know<00:01:22.259> that's<00:01:22.650> the<00:01:22.830> way<00:01:22.920> it<00:01:23.070> is<00:01:23.130> so

00:01:23.510 --> 00:01:23.520 
because you know that's the way it is so

00:01:23.520 --> 00:01:24.920 
because you know that's the way it is so
