00:00:05.820 --> 00:00:12.670
 there was a lot of curiosity about the new tablets 

00:00:08.680 --> 00:00:14.470
 with windows 8 windows 8 we know it is 

00:00:12.670 --> 00:00:15.910
 available in three versions one 

00:00:14.470 --> 00:00:17.289
 standard version therefore the same as 

00:00:15.910 --> 00:00:19.569
 a pro version goes on the desktop 

00:00:17.289 --> 00:00:21.369
 intended for those professional tablets 

00:00:19.569 --> 00:00:24.579
 with the pen those took business and one 

00:00:21.369 --> 00:00:26.229
 rp version for arm active processors 

00:00:24.579 --> 00:00:28.089
 tab what we have 

00:00:26.229 --> 00:00:30.939
 four hands are trying is the 

00:00:28.089 --> 00:00:32.800
 samsung model for windows 

00:00:30.939 --> 00:00:34.900
 rt therefore for the arm version 

00:00:32.800 --> 00:00:37.120
 inside there is a qualcomm processor 

00:00:34.900 --> 00:00:39.250
 1.5 gb snapdragon 

00:00:37.120 --> 00:00:41.020
 the very thin and light net cav 

00:00:39.250 --> 00:00:43.300
 really seems to have a 

00:00:41.020 --> 00:00:46.660
 galaxy tab difference we see it on 

00:00:43.300 --> 00:00:48.850
 10.1 inch screen 1300 67 768 

00:00:46.660 --> 00:00:49.780
 pixel is the operating system that it is 

00:00:48.850 --> 00:00:52.270
 instead windows 

00:00:49.780 --> 00:00:53.680
 rt when we launch windows lunch 

00:00:52.270 --> 00:00:55.420
 instantaneously we find ourselves before this 

00:00:53.680 --> 00:00:58.720
 interface that you can't always call 

00:00:55.420 --> 00:01:00.340
 m because it is a registered trademark 

00:00:58.720 --> 00:01:02.710
 but it is a features interface of 

00:01:00.340 --> 00:01:07.990
 windows 8 that is also seen on 

00:01:02.710 --> 00:01:09.880
 company smartphones tiles are 

00:01:07.990 --> 00:01:11.979
 animate you can move are 

00:01:09.880 --> 00:01:14.859
 present several screens including 

00:01:11.979 --> 00:01:16.389
 browse this windows nt already 

00:01:14.859 --> 00:01:18.310
 really impressed at speed 

00:01:16.389 --> 00:01:19.539
 especially in the home on this one 

00:01:18.310 --> 00:01:21.880
 initial interface here that really 

00:01:19.539 --> 00:01:24.880
 fluid and reactive now in a few 

00:01:21.880 --> 00:01:26.619
 second we start to move and see 

00:01:24.880 --> 00:01:29.139
 how it behaves 

00:01:26.619 --> 00:01:31.359
 really good creativity though too 

00:01:29.139 --> 00:01:32.679
 some flaws such as not all 

00:01:31.359 --> 00:01:35.049
 sizes lead us to applications 

00:01:32.679 --> 00:01:37.299
 native for windows rt this is 

00:01:35.049 --> 00:01:39.219
 a native application we clicked 

00:01:37.299 --> 00:01:41.439
 above is a kind of travel diary 

00:01:39.219 --> 00:01:43.810
 are of articles of the magazine and the 

00:01:41.439 --> 00:01:45.459
 end a page of bing we see 

00:01:43.810 --> 00:01:50.130
 internet shoot 10 first surf on 

00:01:45.459 --> 00:01:54.009
 south ideas for example extended keyboard 

00:01:50.130 --> 00:01:56.469
 very sensitive we load the site 

00:01:54.009 --> 00:01:57.500
 hoping the band here will let us 

00:01:56.469 --> 00:01:59.490
 why 

00:01:57.500 --> 00:02:01.020
 obviously not always at the fair 

00:01:59.490 --> 00:02:02.700
 however, the optimal band is available 

00:02:01.020 --> 00:02:07.320
 anyway , it's loading on you 

00:02:02.700 --> 00:02:08.759
 let's hope we cross our fingers here 

00:02:07.320 --> 00:02:11.850
 some arrive we wait for it to load 

00:02:08.759 --> 00:02:14.489
 of everything because I also have it anyway 

00:02:11.850 --> 00:02:15.870
 in charge of everything we see that the 

00:02:14.489 --> 00:02:17.160
 reactivity is obviously not yet the 

00:02:15.870 --> 00:02:20.100
 final version for responsiveness 

00:02:17.160 --> 00:02:21.720
 the system is really good experience 

00:02:20.100 --> 00:02:25.170
 usage is however that of a 

00:02:21.720 --> 00:02:28.110
 high-end tablet both ios and 

00:02:25.170 --> 00:02:31.459
 android fluidissimo really come back to the 

00:02:28.110 --> 00:02:33.480
 our main pole with the gesture e 

00:02:31.459 --> 00:02:34.860
 let's see what happens when 

00:02:33.480 --> 00:02:37.350
 for example we press one of the 

00:02:34.860 --> 00:02:40.500
 applications such as office 

00:02:37.350 --> 00:02:42.780
 office and integrated by pressing offensive in 

00:02:40.500 --> 00:02:44.130
 right environment this is the ugly part 

00:02:42.780 --> 00:02:46.200
 of windows 

00:02:44.130 --> 00:02:47.970
 rt with all applications are 

00:02:46.200 --> 00:02:50.010
 there are still many optimized 

00:02:47.970 --> 00:02:52.130
 applications such as the 

00:02:50.010 --> 00:02:54.860
 office suite that 

00:02:52.130 --> 00:02:56.570
 is the same office that we see on 

00:02:54.860 --> 00:02:57.950
 text then very small keys 

00:02:56.570 --> 00:02:59.990
 same windows very difficult 

00:02:57.950 --> 00:03:01.400
 use closing it then we find ourselves 

00:02:59.990 --> 00:03:02.810
 inside the rest itself and therefore 

00:03:01.400 --> 00:03:05.240
 we have to do the gesture to return 

00:03:02.810 --> 00:03:08.060
 on our home screen windows networks 

00:03:05.240 --> 00:03:09.260
 would have really been a system we see 

00:03:08.060 --> 00:03:11.540
 some applications so much that suter 

00:03:09.260 --> 00:03:13.370
 elected of samsung windows 

00:03:11.540 --> 00:03:15.710
 rt would have really been a system 

00:03:13.370 --> 00:03:17.780
 very very valid and certainly will be a 

00:03:15.710 --> 00:03:19.520
 valid system if the 

00:03:17.780 --> 00:03:21.740
 applications that have been designed for 

00:03:19.520 --> 00:03:23.660
 networks for arm applications then those 

00:03:21.740 --> 00:03:25.430
 that gm in this interface in scope 

00:03:23.660 --> 00:03:27.920
 meter without letting us see the desktop 

00:03:25.430 --> 00:03:29.990
 desktop that inevitably microsoft 

00:03:27.920 --> 00:03:31.850
 will have to progressively eliminate by 

00:03:29.990 --> 00:03:33.140
 leave us only native applications like 

00:03:31.850 --> 00:03:35.390
 the one this diary is seeing 

00:03:33.140 --> 00:03:37.340
 made by samsung is installed 

00:03:35.390 --> 00:03:39.560
 exclusively on this on this 

00:03:37.340 --> 00:03:42.470
 tablet using windows 8 

00:03:39.560 --> 00:03:45.080
 rt is indeed valid and certainly the 

00:03:42.470 --> 00:03:47.270
 system is well done is already stable and already 

00:03:45.080 --> 00:03:48.800
 fast and already fluid you could not 

00:03:47.270 --> 00:03:50.480
 ask for better from a tablet 

00:03:48.800 --> 00:03:52.250
 actually the problem is always 

00:03:50.480 --> 00:03:53.630
 those small applications like office 

00:03:52.250 --> 00:03:55.130
 which should be applied in 

00:03:53.630 --> 00:03:56.600
 principles of this tablet that for the 

00:03:55.130 --> 00:03:59.480
 productivity that is missing perhaps 

00:03:56.600 --> 00:04:01.820
 tablet android apps that if 

00:03:59.480 --> 00:04:03.500
 launched end up in the old environment 

00:04:01.820 --> 00:04:05.210
 an environment that is used well with the 

00:04:03.500 --> 00:04:06.740
 keyboard with a mouse is used well 

00:04:05.210 --> 00:04:08.180
 maybe with the nib of the pro versions of 

00:04:06.740 --> 00:04:10.640
 these tablets but with your fingers 

00:04:08.180 --> 00:04:14.390
 absolutely unusable and and is pure 

00:04:10.640 --> 00:04:16.400
 ugly to see then impression 

00:04:14.390 --> 00:04:19.160
 definitely positive 

00:04:16.400 --> 00:04:20.359
 the departure is good microsoft must 

00:04:19.160 --> 00:04:21.950
 absolutely accomplish what you 

00:04:20.359 --> 00:04:24.920
 promised with integration of others 

00:04:21.950 --> 00:04:27.520
 devices and the windows 8 tablet can 

00:04:24.920 --> 00:04:27.520
 also be successful
