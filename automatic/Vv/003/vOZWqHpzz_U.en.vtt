00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:06.870
 for the crossed roast you need 

00:00:01.860 --> 00:00:09.000
 pig fresh herbs and bacon as 

00:00:06.870 --> 00:00:10.679
 first is the silent salmon on the 

00:00:09.000 --> 00:00:12.480
 cut in the skin side that has the 

00:00:10.679 --> 00:00:15.150
 advantage that the roast at the same time 

00:00:12.480 --> 00:00:17.430
 do not cook and possibly cook 

00:00:15.150 --> 00:00:19.500
 meat juice from the roast pressed 

00:00:17.430 --> 00:00:21.750
 furthermore, the fat can do well 

00:00:19.500 --> 00:00:25.470
 spread out and it will be a nice one 

00:00:21.750 --> 00:00:26.220
 Crust then produces the herbs 

00:00:25.470 --> 00:00:29.130
 sliced 

00:00:26.220 --> 00:00:34.559
 thyme rosemary a bit ointment and 

00:00:29.130 --> 00:00:36.300
 peter they cut everything nicely 

00:00:34.559 --> 00:00:38.070
 is not going to hack the herbs 

00:00:36.300 --> 00:00:43.440
 but really nice to cut 

00:00:38.070 --> 00:00:45.059
 because otherwise they will be bitter 

00:00:43.440 --> 00:00:47.160
 Next is the swine salmon 

00:00:45.059 --> 00:00:50.850
 The sick now have to be rid of them all 

00:00:47.160 --> 00:00:53.460
 a nice golden yellow sear with it 

00:00:50.850 --> 00:00:56.250
 nice brazil roma war is important 

00:00:53.460 --> 00:00:59.340
 At the same time, the Nazis only really fried 

00:00:56.250 --> 00:01:02.930
 Sharp from all sides they will 

00:00:59.340 --> 00:01:02.930
 first morning 

00:01:10.390 --> 00:01:14.740
 nice kill me on the other side 

00:01:13.360 --> 00:01:16.870
 I have now used the meat fork 

00:01:14.740 --> 00:01:18.430
 before everyone starts right now 

00:01:16.870 --> 00:01:19.540
 to flame I'm not into the flesh 

00:01:18.430 --> 00:01:20.970
 stung and there is nothing 

00:01:19.540 --> 00:01:23.770
 leaked 

00:01:20.970 --> 00:01:27.670
 a bit of seasoning with sea salt I have 

00:01:23.770 --> 00:01:29.580
 big here now there is one 

00:01:27.670 --> 00:01:33.300
 beautiful delicious crust the old one 

00:01:29.580 --> 00:01:33.300
 brown bear connects 

00:01:37.180 --> 00:01:40.500
 already the edges on 

00:01:42.680 --> 00:01:46.120
 take care that you do not burn yourself 

00:01:56.080 --> 00:01:59.920
 we'll take that right away is bad 

00:01:57.400 --> 00:02:02.320
 from all sides frowned upon for 

00:01:59.920 --> 00:02:08.619
 Now put me on my bed 

00:02:02.320 --> 00:02:11.340
 and the whole with the herbs 

00:02:08.619 --> 00:02:14.590
 spread herbs well on the meat 

00:02:11.340 --> 00:02:16.720
 Before, add some pepper to the pepper 

00:02:14.590 --> 00:02:19.600
 rub little and then the herbs 

00:02:16.720 --> 00:02:27.490
 so that the herbs are nicely distributed 

00:02:19.600 --> 00:02:31.030
 Massage in a bit then the 

00:02:27.490 --> 00:02:33.430
 bacon on it spreads nice bacon like that 

00:02:31.030 --> 00:02:35.080
 distribute the pig salmon whole 

00:02:33.430 --> 00:02:38.230
 it is covered that has the advantage that 

00:02:35.080 --> 00:02:40.570
 the fat from the bacon is about the same 

00:02:38.230 --> 00:02:45.520
 which can infuse herbs into the meat 

00:02:40.570 --> 00:02:48.810
 that will be super delicious whole account 

00:02:45.520 --> 00:02:48.810
 aluminum foil and economic smashed 

00:02:57.860 --> 00:03:02.400
 after we packed the whole thing nicely 

00:03:00.060 --> 00:03:05.190
 it comes on a sheet metal and will 

00:03:02.400 --> 00:03:07.490
 now in the oven 140 degrees in about one 

00:03:05.190 --> 00:03:10.490
 hour the guard and after that it is 

00:03:07.490 --> 00:03:10.490

00:03:12.240 --> 00:03:17.350
 finally our meat is ready now 

00:03:14.700 --> 00:03:19.690
 we cut write it with a 

00:03:17.350 --> 00:03:21.520
 as sharp as possible with the knife 

00:03:19.690 --> 00:03:22.530
 Bacon does not fall off and the herbs 

00:03:21.520 --> 00:03:25.930
 stay on it too 

00:03:22.530 --> 00:03:29.910
