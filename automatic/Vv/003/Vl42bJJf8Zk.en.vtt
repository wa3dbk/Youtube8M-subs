00:04:49.559 --> 00:04:49.569 
forever and live in the ocean or do both

00:04:49.569 --> 00:04:51.510 
forever and live in the ocean or do both
but<00:04:49.960> if<00:04:50.380> you<00:04:50.530> wanted<00:04:50.770> to<00:04:50.889> go<00:04:51.009> think<00:04:51.340> how<00:04:51.460> to

00:04:51.510 --> 00:04:51.520 
but if you wanted to go think how to

00:04:51.520 --> 00:04:52.649 
but if you wanted to go think how to
find<00:04:51.880> this<00:04:52.030> one<00:04:52.270> thing

00:04:52.649 --> 00:04:52.659 
find this one thing

00:04:52.659 --> 00:04:55.110 
find this one thing
I'll<00:04:53.229> walk<00:04:53.440> it<00:04:53.680> but<00:04:54.400> we<00:04:54.520> can't<00:04:54.729> take<00:04:54.970> these

00:04:55.110 --> 00:04:55.120 
I'll walk it but we can't take these

00:04:55.120 --> 00:04:58.320 
I'll walk it but we can't take these
necklaces<00:04:55.630> off<00:04:56.280> so<00:04:57.280> we<00:04:57.490> just<00:04:57.669> have<00:04:57.849> to<00:04:57.970> find<00:04:58.150> a

00:04:58.320 --> 00:04:58.330 
necklaces off so we just have to find a

00:04:58.330 --> 00:05:00.450 
necklaces off so we just have to find a
walk<00:04:58.509> and<00:04:58.720> you<00:04:58.870> know<00:04:59.020> see<00:04:59.229> you<00:04:59.289> I<00:04:59.590> know<00:04:59.919> but<00:05:00.310> if

00:05:00.450 --> 00:05:00.460 
walk and you know see you I know but if

00:05:00.460 --> 00:05:02.219 
walk and you know see you I know but if
we<00:05:00.580> can't<00:05:00.759> these<00:05:00.909> necklaces<00:05:01.360> follow<00:05:01.810> the<00:05:02.110> our

00:05:02.219 --> 00:05:02.229 
we can't these necklaces follow the our

00:05:02.229 --> 00:05:04.589 
we can't these necklaces follow the our
controller<00:05:02.620> doesn't<00:05:03.610> maybe<00:05:03.970> if<00:05:04.150> we<00:05:04.270> find<00:05:04.449> the

00:05:04.589 --> 00:05:04.599 
controller doesn't maybe if we find the

00:05:04.599 --> 00:05:06.659 
controller doesn't maybe if we find the
locket<00:05:04.810> maybe<00:05:05.199> a<00:05:05.440> little<00:05:05.590> power<00:05:05.889> design<00:05:06.099> have

00:05:06.659 --> 00:05:06.669 
locket maybe a little power design have

00:05:06.669 --> 00:05:09.390 
locket maybe a little power design have
control<00:05:07.090> ya<00:05:07.509> know<00:05:07.870> it<00:05:08.080> does<00:05:08.319> say<00:05:08.590> it<00:05:08.830> says<00:05:09.099> that

00:05:09.390 --> 00:05:09.400 
control ya know it does say it says that

00:05:09.400 --> 00:05:11.100 
control ya know it does say it says that
it<00:05:09.580> could<00:05:09.759> be<00:05:09.849> in<00:05:09.940> the<00:05:10.030> ocean<00:05:10.210> or<00:05:10.599> the<00:05:10.630> forest

00:05:11.100 --> 00:05:11.110 
it could be in the ocean or the forest

00:05:11.110 --> 00:05:13.050 
it could be in the ocean or the forest
but<00:05:11.289> it's<00:05:11.409> more<00:05:11.650> likely<00:05:11.860> to<00:05:12.159> be<00:05:12.280> in<00:05:12.460> the<00:05:12.699> ocean

00:05:13.050 --> 00:05:13.060 
but it's more likely to be in the ocean

00:05:13.060 --> 00:05:15.210 
but it's more likely to be in the ocean
so<00:05:13.539> we<00:05:13.569> look<00:05:13.990> at<00:05:14.080> the<00:05:14.169> ocean<00:05:14.409> burst<00:05:14.650> right<00:05:14.949> yeah

00:05:15.210 --> 00:05:15.220 
so we look at the ocean burst right yeah

00:05:15.220 --> 00:05:18.270 
so we look at the ocean burst right yeah
let's<00:05:15.580> go<00:05:15.780> because<00:05:16.780> you<00:05:16.930> know<00:05:16.990> it<00:05:17.650> could<00:05:18.039> be<00:05:18.069> in

00:05:18.270 --> 00:05:18.280 
let's go because you know it could be in

00:05:18.280 --> 00:05:19.830 
let's go because you know it could be in
the<00:05:18.400> forest<00:05:18.729> it<00:05:18.909> may<00:05:19.030> be<00:05:19.090> trying<00:05:19.389> to<00:05:19.449> trick<00:05:19.690> us

00:05:19.830 --> 00:05:19.840 
the forest it may be trying to trick us

00:05:19.840 --> 00:05:21.300 
the forest it may be trying to trick us
because<00:05:20.169> maybe<00:05:20.319> they<00:05:20.530> don't<00:05:20.710> want<00:05:20.889> any<00:05:21.130> more

00:05:21.300 --> 00:05:21.310 
because maybe they don't want any more

00:05:21.310 --> 00:05:23.249 
because maybe they don't want any more
late<00:05:21.490> well<00:05:22.210> we<00:05:22.630> look<00:05:22.900> at<00:05:23.020> the<00:05:23.080> force

00:05:23.249 --> 00:05:23.259 
late well we look at the force

00:05:23.259 --> 00:05:26.520 
late well we look at the force
afterwards<00:05:23.770> okay
