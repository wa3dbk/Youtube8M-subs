00:00:22.790 --> 00:00:26.279
 by us the message reaches the nasher 

00:00:25.079 --> 00:00:28.619
 stop almost the entire 

00:00:26.279 --> 00:00:30.090
 range but at least one 

00:00:28.619 --> 00:00:32.099
 kind of surprised 

00:00:30.090 --> 00:00:34.890
 why would you stop it like that 

00:00:32.099 --> 00:00:35.970
 well certainly does 

00:00:34.890 --> 00:00:37.920
 but then the different legs 

00:00:35.970 --> 00:00:39.690
 When we came in , we soon understood what is 

00:00:37.920 --> 00:00:41.399
 the sentence had been 

00:00:39.690 --> 00:00:43.199
 each one thoughtful in 

00:00:41.399 --> 00:00:44.579
 innovative products 

00:00:43.199 --> 00:00:47.519
 one of those legs in my eyes 

00:00:44.579 --> 00:00:49.260
 is the series for jeans and pussy 

00:00:47.519 --> 00:00:51.030
 I would like to leave that in this video 

00:00:49.260 --> 00:00:52.679
 See how the people might wonder 

00:00:51.030 --> 00:00:54.629
 in the old days the girl had stopped 

00:00:52.679 --> 00:00:57.059
 is with the known scopex boilies 

00:00:54.629 --> 00:00:58.589
 they are processed here and not alone 

00:00:57.059 --> 00:01:01.949
 but that has been supplemented once more 

00:00:58.589 --> 00:01:04.559
 with rubber ate a top ingredient 

00:01:01.949 --> 00:01:05.970
 liver oil that causes the all 

00:01:04.559 --> 00:01:09.119
 it slowly adds out 

00:01:05.970 --> 00:01:10.770
 tasty as it were and some 

00:01:09.119 --> 00:01:12.570
 sweetness after which she is also very famous for 

00:01:10.770 --> 00:01:15.240
 which is also all fish friendly 

00:01:12.570 --> 00:01:18.930
 its certainly during this time it is 

00:01:15.240 --> 00:01:21.149
 nice if you have a nice one like this thing 

00:01:18.930 --> 00:01:23.610
 scoping shed which, incidentally, appears 

00:01:21.149 --> 00:01:27.930
 soft as nice body almost always 

00:01:23.610 --> 00:01:29.250
 just that you can supplement it with 

00:01:27.930 --> 00:01:31.380
 ground feed 

00:01:29.250 --> 00:01:33.810
 with the water temperature so this moment so 

00:01:31.380 --> 00:01:35.230
 I think between 8 and 9 degrees is light 

00:01:33.810 --> 00:01:36.670
 not see very much 

00:01:35.230 --> 00:01:38.680
 because a lot of boilies throw outside 

00:01:36.670 --> 00:01:42.130
 Because you put that together we have a quick one 

00:01:38.680 --> 00:01:43.690
 making us saturated is that hooked up 

00:01:42.130 --> 00:01:45.070
 bar 

00:01:43.690 --> 00:01:47.260
 how they feel you look 

00:01:45.070 --> 00:01:56.430
 I'll show you I have 

00:01:47.260 --> 00:01:56.430
 here in the big whore 

00:02:17.129 --> 00:02:23.659
 this is a very nice structure 

00:02:19.409 --> 00:02:23.659
 really that it contains everything 

00:02:25.079 --> 00:02:30.420
 ground living room with a little bit 

00:02:26.510 --> 00:02:31.709
 spit liquid bates, we will still do that 

00:02:30.420 --> 00:02:35.760
 once 

00:02:31.709 --> 00:02:37.200
 of course you can also create those bates 

00:02:35.760 --> 00:02:39.299
 use it to soak your buddies 

00:02:37.200 --> 00:02:41.329
 but also to use with your stick mix 

00:02:39.299 --> 00:02:41.329
 to make 

00:02:49.139 --> 00:02:52.469
 now you can already see it a bit 

00:02:50.549 --> 00:02:53.430
 shape is starting to take shape 

00:02:52.469 --> 00:02:55.650
 not super 

00:02:53.430 --> 00:02:57.989
 certainly not to be sticky if you like 

00:02:55.650 --> 00:02:59.489
 you put it in a pva stick because that 

00:02:57.989 --> 00:03:01.500
 pva stick the whole course 

00:02:59.489 --> 00:03:03.449
 holds together 

00:03:01.500 --> 00:03:04.889
 now in a small base you need it 

00:03:03.449 --> 00:03:07.859
 we will enrich it with fir 

00:03:04.889 --> 00:03:09.959
 namely meat I really do a lot 

00:03:07.859 --> 00:03:12.180
 ingenious set of nash and actually 

00:03:09.959 --> 00:03:14.400
 cubes boy and apart from me 

00:03:12.180 --> 00:03:15.989
 You saved a lot of time getting this 

00:03:14.400 --> 00:03:19.549
 make flashes from your mills that you 

00:03:15.989 --> 00:03:29.569
 buy yourself you can use them very well 

00:03:19.549 --> 00:03:29.569
 to fill your steak with water like this 

00:03:35.099 --> 00:03:41.549
 mama is also very good for it 

00:03:36.419 --> 00:03:43.079
 is because they are flat and you 

00:03:41.549 --> 00:03:45.930
 for example, on top of a wierbed 

00:03:43.079 --> 00:03:49.439
 fish with a chod rig that kind of like that 

00:03:45.930 --> 00:03:52.349
 blogs bowley beauval too flat in addition 

00:03:49.439 --> 00:03:54.389
 also nice to use as meat bait 

00:03:52.349 --> 00:03:57.479
 to use if you have multiple slices 

00:03:54.389 --> 00:03:59.430
 superimposed regain your you have 

00:03:57.479 --> 00:04:01.620
 Of course a whole different form anything 

00:03:59.430 --> 00:04:03.750
 what the carp have not seen yet 

00:04:01.620 --> 00:04:06.150
 and finally and of course completely beautiful 

00:04:03.750 --> 00:04:07.439
 when there will be a tight air party you will 

00:04:06.150 --> 00:04:08.189
 with a buddy soon see him there 

00:04:07.439 --> 00:04:10.500
 from unrolling 

00:04:08.189 --> 00:04:12.389
 but even then such a meat is ideal because 

00:04:10.500 --> 00:04:14.250
 is a flat different forge quit series 

00:04:12.389 --> 00:04:16.889
 completely nicely to do with you 

00:04:14.250 --> 00:04:18.239
 of course also a nice puppy series 

00:04:16.889 --> 00:04:20.969
 Added to that is a nice one 

00:04:18.239 --> 00:04:22.949
 that you really for the same taste 

00:04:20.969 --> 00:04:25.590
 have different colors as it were 

00:04:22.949 --> 00:04:28.050
 as you see here the idea behind it 

00:04:25.590 --> 00:04:30.060
 is that you get the color perfectly on the color 

00:04:28.050 --> 00:04:32.610
 from the bottom 

00:04:30.060 --> 00:04:33.960
 for example, they put on a dark fish 

00:04:32.610 --> 00:04:35.430
 it and is a white boy of course one 

00:04:33.960 --> 00:04:36.479
 very good option because he is very sorry 

00:04:35.430 --> 00:04:38.190
 stands out 

00:04:36.479 --> 00:04:40.830
 fish for some deeper water than these 

00:04:38.190 --> 00:04:43.589
 purple boilies we very beautiful and because 

00:04:40.830 --> 00:04:45.240
 purple and blue incidentally it along the 

00:04:43.589 --> 00:04:46.800
 remain visible under water as 

00:04:45.240 --> 00:04:47.900
 you go deeper that has with the decline 

00:04:46.800 --> 00:04:49.830
 of the light 

00:04:47.900 --> 00:04:51.570
 well in addition we of course have one 

00:04:49.830 --> 00:04:54.050
 bright yellow and orange it actually 

00:04:51.570 --> 00:04:56.280
 always do well and also a pink variant 

00:04:54.050 --> 00:04:58.440
 which started to be a lot of fun among the 

00:04:56.280 --> 00:04:59.700
 customers as long as it stands out nicely 

00:04:58.440 --> 00:05:01.380
 then you can take very beautiful ones with you 

00:04:59.700 --> 00:05:03.200
 experiment without necessarily having to 

00:05:01.380 --> 00:05:05.370
 a different taste boilie has to fish 

00:05:03.200 --> 00:05:08.040
 what i do about as well as i do if i have one 

00:05:05.370 --> 00:05:09.780
 few water fish then use the same 

00:05:08.040 --> 00:05:11.370
 principle but then i turn it like it 

00:05:09.780 --> 00:05:13.190
 If it were true then it would be light on me 

00:05:11.370 --> 00:05:16.230
 bottom then I will grab a white body 

00:05:13.190 --> 00:05:18.090
 that is of course less noticeable but 

00:05:16.230 --> 00:05:19.560
 that might be the one 

00:05:18.090 --> 00:05:21.810
 what that water then needs at that moment 

00:05:19.560 --> 00:05:24.420
 because the carp is rather fast 

00:05:21.810 --> 00:05:25.590
 since those fish often deter 

00:05:24.420 --> 00:05:26.610
 to be under pressure 

00:05:25.590 --> 00:05:28.850
 so I would certainly experiment with that 

00:05:26.610 --> 00:05:31.260
 and play a little with it 

00:05:28.850 --> 00:05:34.530
 This is actually the whole series you 

00:05:31.260 --> 00:05:37.320
 for that squad of nash in a my eyes 

00:05:34.530 --> 00:05:40.110
 really a nice addition to it 

00:05:37.320 --> 00:05:41.340
 the entire segment for carp anglers 

00:05:40.110 --> 00:05:43.650
 you if they want to order it could 

00:05:41.340 --> 00:05:45.120
 of course in the webshop you can go below 

00:05:43.650 --> 00:05:46.380
 the video all products again 

00:05:45.120 --> 00:05:50.280
 from which you see 

00:05:46.380 --> 00:05:51.780
 And yes I would say take advantage of it 

00:05:50.280 --> 00:05:53.760
 because it is new so it is still 

00:05:51.780 --> 00:05:55.970
 unknown good luck and until the next 

00:05:53.760 --> 00:05:55.970
 times 

00:05:59.480 --> 00:06:01.630
 Yes
