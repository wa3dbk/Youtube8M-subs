00:01:59.330 --> 00:01:59.340 
to do once a week probably every Friday

00:01:59.340 --> 00:02:02.149 
to do once a week probably every Friday

00:02:03.289 --> 00:02:03.299 
probably make it around a 10 to

00:02:03.299 --> 00:02:05.899 
probably make it around a 10 to
15-minute<00:02:03.780> video<00:02:04.200> or<00:02:04.649> so<00:02:04.950> of<00:02:05.159> me<00:02:05.640> reading

things<00:02:07.890> and<00:02:08.069> I'll<00:02:08.190> read<00:02:08.429> them<00:02:08.520> as<00:02:08.700> as<00:02:09.060> we're

00:02:09.650 --> 00:02:09.660 
things and I'll read them as as we're

00:02:09.660 --> 00:02:11.840 
things and I'll read them as as we're
going<00:02:10.020> I'll<00:02:10.250> read<00:02:11.250> them<00:02:11.459> and

00:02:11.840 --> 00:02:11.850 
going I'll read them and

00:02:11.850 --> 00:02:14.360 
going I'll read them and
answer<00:02:12.180> them<00:02:12.360> to<00:02:13.140> the<00:02:13.170> best<00:02:13.290> I<00:02:13.620> possibly<00:02:13.650> can

00:02:14.360 --> 00:02:14.370 
answer them to the best I possibly can

00:02:14.370 --> 00:02:15.710 
answer them to the best I possibly can
so<00:02:14.580> that<00:02:14.610> way<00:02:14.820> kind<00:02:15.090> of<00:02:15.150> adds<00:02:15.330> a<00:02:15.480> little<00:02:15.570> bit

00:02:15.710 --> 00:02:15.720 
so that way kind of adds a little bit

00:02:15.720 --> 00:02:18.020 
so that way kind of adds a little bit
more<00:02:15.930> interactive<00:02:16.710> pneus<00:02:16.890> with<00:02:17.310> me<00:02:17.790> and<00:02:17.940> you
