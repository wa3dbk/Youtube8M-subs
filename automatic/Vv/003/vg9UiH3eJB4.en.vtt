and<00:01:05.159> that<00:01:05.309> on<00:01:05.460> to<00:01:05.579> the<00:01:05.670> kingpin<00:01:08.299> may<00:01:09.299> be<00:01:09.360> a

00:01:09.469 --> 00:01:09.479 
and that on to the kingpin may be a

00:01:09.479 --> 00:01:10.850 
and that on to the kingpin may be a
little<00:01:09.659> tough<00:01:09.869> to<00:01:09.899> get<00:01:10.110> on<00:01:10.259> depending<00:01:10.710> what

through the hanger hole take another

00:01:20.340 --> 00:01:31.280 
through the hanger hole take another
bushing

00:01:31.280 --> 00:01:31.290 

00:01:31.290 --> 00:01:36.490 

that<00:01:32.040> on<00:01:32.660> take<00:01:33.660> another<00:01:33.690> washer<00:01:34.910> add<00:01:35.910> that<00:01:36.150> on

00:01:36.490 --> 00:01:36.500 
that on take another washer add that on

00:01:36.500 --> 00:01:40.670 
that on take another washer add that on
then<00:01:37.500> take<00:01:37.800> one<00:01:37.980> of<00:01:38.070> the<00:01:38.130> base<00:01:38.280> plates<00:01:39.530> and<00:01:40.530> I

00:01:40.670 --> 00:01:40.680 
then take one of the base plates and I

00:01:40.680 --> 00:01:44.450 
then take one of the base plates and I
just<00:01:42.200> sure<00:01:43.200> the<00:01:43.320> threads<00:01:43.620> line<00:01:43.890> out<00:01:44.040> properly

00:01:44.450 --> 00:01:44.460 
just sure the threads line out properly

00:01:44.460 --> 00:01:48.440 
just sure the threads line out properly
then<00:01:45.360> just<00:01:45.630> spin<00:01:45.870> it<00:01:45.990> around<00:01:46.110> once<00:01:46.620> twice<00:01:47.450> sure

00:01:48.440 --> 00:01:48.450 
then just spin it around once twice sure

00:01:48.450 --> 00:01:50.360 
then just spin it around once twice sure
the<00:01:48.570> lines<00:01:48.750> hold<00:01:49.020> up<00:01:49.230> take<00:01:49.890> the<00:01:50.040> regular

00:01:50.360 --> 00:01:50.370 
the lines hold up take the regular

00:01:50.370 --> 00:01:52.400 
the lines hold up take the regular
screwdriver<00:01:50.640> end<00:01:51.090> now<00:01:51.990> it's<00:01:52.110> you<00:01:52.170> don't<00:01:52.229> need

00:01:52.400 --> 00:01:52.410 
screwdriver end now it's you don't need

00:01:52.410 --> 00:01:54.590 
screwdriver end now it's you don't need
an<00:01:52.500> allen<00:01:52.800> key<00:01:52.830> or<00:01:53.250> the<00:01:53.340> nut<00:01:53.520> end<00:01:53.700> this<00:01:54.420> is<00:01:54.570> a

00:01:54.590 --> 00:01:54.600 
an allen key or the nut end this is a

00:01:54.600 --> 00:01:56.930 
an allen key or the nut end this is a
regular<00:01:55.050> screw<00:01:55.350> for<00:01:55.530> the<00:01:55.620> kingpin<00:01:56.040> and

00:01:56.930 --> 00:01:56.940 
regular screw for the kingpin and

00:01:56.940 --> 00:01:58.940 
regular screw for the kingpin and
because<00:01:57.240> of<00:01:57.270> that<00:01:57.450> that<00:01:58.200> allows<00:01:58.470> you<00:01:58.650> to<00:01:58.800> use

00:01:58.940 --> 00:01:58.950 
because of that that allows you to use

00:01:58.950 --> 00:02:01.880 
because of that that allows you to use
these<00:01:59.130> big<00:02:00.080> bushings<00:02:01.080> instead<00:02:01.440> of<00:02:01.560> just<00:02:01.710> one

00:02:01.880 --> 00:02:01.890 
these big bushings instead of just one

00:02:01.890 --> 00:02:03.530 
these big bushings instead of just one
smaller<00:02:02.310> bushing<00:02:02.729> or<00:02:02.820> one<00:02:02.970> bigger<00:02:03.150> bushing

00:02:03.530 --> 00:02:03.540 
smaller bushing or one bigger bushing

00:02:03.540 --> 00:02:06.380 
smaller bushing or one bigger bushing
like<00:02:03.690> many<00:02:03.900> trucks<00:02:04.910> tighten<00:02:05.910> that<00:02:06.000> down<00:02:06.060> to

00:02:06.380 --> 00:02:06.390 
like many trucks tighten that down to

00:02:06.390 --> 00:02:09.800 
like many trucks tighten that down to
however<00:02:06.570> you<00:02:06.780> want<00:02:06.840> it<00:02:08.240> then<00:02:09.240> you<00:02:09.330> take<00:02:09.570> one<00:02:09.780> of

00:02:09.800 --> 00:02:09.810 
however you want it then you take one of

00:02:09.810 --> 00:02:12.260 
however you want it then you take one of
the<00:02:10.070> what<00:02:11.070> I<00:02:11.100> like<00:02:11.340> to<00:02:11.430> do<00:02:11.550> is<00:02:11.760> before<00:02:11.910> you<00:02:12.120> put

00:02:12.260 --> 00:02:12.270 
the what I like to do is before you put

00:02:12.270 --> 00:02:14.449 
the what I like to do is before you put
it<00:02:12.360> onto<00:02:12.510> your<00:02:12.720> board<00:02:13.040> first<00:02:14.040> time<00:02:14.250> you<00:02:14.340> take

00:02:14.449 --> 00:02:14.459 
it onto your board first time you take

00:02:14.459 --> 00:02:16.400 
it onto your board first time you take
it<00:02:14.610> out<00:02:14.700> of<00:02:14.730> the<00:02:14.820> package<00:02:15.240> put<00:02:16.080> the<00:02:16.170> screws

00:02:16.400 --> 00:02:16.410 
it out of the package put the screws

00:02:16.410 --> 00:02:18.680 
it out of the package put the screws
into<00:02:16.650> the<00:02:16.830> bottom<00:02:16.920> of<00:02:17.280> the<00:02:17.370> base<00:02:17.550> plate<00:02:17.730> makes

00:02:18.680 --> 00:02:18.690 
into the bottom of the base plate makes

00:02:18.690 --> 00:02:20.600 
into the bottom of the base plate makes
it<00:02:18.840> attaching<00:02:19.410> to<00:02:19.560> the<00:02:19.650> board<00:02:19.860> a<00:02:20.010> lot<00:02:20.250> easier

00:02:20.600 --> 00:02:20.610 
it attaching to the board a lot easier

00:02:20.610 --> 00:02:23.510 
it attaching to the board a lot easier
if<00:02:20.730> you've<00:02:20.910> already<00:02:21.090> made<00:02:21.390> the<00:02:21.600> threads<00:02:22.520> in

00:02:23.510 --> 00:02:23.520 
if you've already made the threads in

00:02:23.520 --> 00:02:27.320 
if you've already made the threads in
the<00:02:23.930> base<00:02:24.930> plate<00:02:25.200> for<00:02:25.800> these<00:02:25.920> screws<00:02:26.209> it'll<00:02:27.209> be

00:02:27.320 --> 00:02:27.330 
the base plate for these screws it'll be

00:02:27.330 --> 00:02:32.720 
the base plate for these screws it'll be
a<00:02:27.360> little<00:02:27.720> bit<00:02:27.840> tough<00:02:28.080> to<00:02:28.110> turn<00:02:28.380> these<00:02:30.620> but<00:02:31.730> be

00:02:32.720 --> 00:02:32.730 
a little bit tough to turn these but be

00:02:32.730 --> 00:02:37.390 
a little bit tough to turn these but be
happy<00:02:33.120> later

00:02:37.390 --> 00:02:37.400 

00:02:37.400 --> 00:02:44.590 

screw<00:02:38.150> all<00:02:38.299> four<00:02:38.629> down<00:02:40.900> that
