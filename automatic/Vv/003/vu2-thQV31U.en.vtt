00:00:23.710 --> 00:00:29.579
 friends of minus we are going to prepare 

00:00:25.929 --> 00:00:32.649
 few morsels of bread we 

00:00:29.579 --> 00:00:35.860
 We published a few days ago on a loaf of 

00:00:32.649 --> 00:00:37.719
 mold to make canapÃ©s and taking advantage 

00:00:35.860 --> 00:00:40.239
 that we have our mold bread that 

00:00:37.719 --> 00:00:43.420
 you can see on our form page 

00:00:40.239 --> 00:00:45.970
 de alella now let's see to ride a 

00:00:43.420 --> 00:00:48.100
 tiny appetizer is very easy to 

00:00:45.970 --> 00:00:49.989
 prepare you will see that they will be very 

00:00:48.100 --> 00:00:53.620
 but to make these channels 

00:00:49.989 --> 00:00:55.739
 we will need some slices of bread 

00:00:53.620 --> 00:00:55.739
 mold 

00:00:56.000 --> 00:01:01.030
 cable cheese 

00:00:57.940 --> 00:01:04.239
 ripe tomato for the recipe some black 

00:01:01.030 --> 00:01:06.690
 boneless a little bit of margarine and 

00:01:04.239 --> 00:01:06.690
 organ 

00:01:07.470 --> 00:01:14.150
 We cut the cheese into slices of medium 

00:01:10.920 --> 00:01:14.150
 centimeter more or less 

00:01:17.510 --> 00:01:22.630
 we will cut the tomatoes into slices 

00:01:20.090 --> 00:01:22.630
 as well 

00:01:27.320 --> 00:01:33.310
 we are going to cut the slice of bread 

00:01:29.800 --> 00:01:33.310
 the bark 

00:01:40.340 --> 00:01:45.700
 now we still have no bread with a 

00:01:42.710 --> 00:01:45.700
 little margarine 

00:01:53.920 --> 00:01:58.650
 now we will make each slice four 

00:01:56.200 --> 00:01:58.650
 bits 

00:02:06.380 --> 00:02:13.200
 we will put on top of the slice 

00:02:08.910 --> 00:02:16.060
 the piece of tomato on top of the tomato 

00:02:13.200 --> 00:02:20.160
 the cheese 

00:02:16.060 --> 00:02:20.160
 the brothers with a little bit of adela 

00:02:22.340 --> 00:02:27.430
 and now 2 

00:02:24.780 --> 00:02:30.810
 black olives 

00:02:27.430 --> 00:02:30.810
 and we puncture them with a toothpick 

00:02:31.569 --> 00:02:35.370
 and prescribed an enzyme 

00:02:44.540 --> 00:02:50.090
 and now baked at 200 degrees above 

00:02:48.170 --> 00:02:53.409

00:02:50.090 --> 00:02:53.409

00:03:04.490 --> 00:03:09.840
