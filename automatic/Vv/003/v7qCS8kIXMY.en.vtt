00:00:05.360 --> 00:00:08.230
 that's about 

00:00:09.059 --> 00:00:14.660
 ask time for health there are different 

00:00:12.400 --> 00:00:17.029
 technical 

00:00:14.660 --> 00:00:22.820
 this is a mechanism to cause u beads and so 

00:00:17.029 --> 00:00:26.300
 further study so here and purity so 

00:00:22.820 --> 00:00:28.910
 further but you will find out what the problem is 

00:00:26.300 --> 00:00:32.960
 Unfortunately the device is considered as people 

00:00:28.910 --> 00:00:36.680
 same thing in the same parable 3 

00:00:32.960 --> 00:00:37.460
 some kind of three blind what is the word here 

00:00:36.680 --> 00:00:40.820
 when leaks 

00:00:37.460 --> 00:00:43.400
 bumps into something takes a tusk there 

00:00:40.820 --> 00:00:45.680
 by the foot by the tail and each draw conclusions 

00:00:43.400 --> 00:00:47.480
 about what is an elephant and got his 

00:00:45.680 --> 00:00:50.870
 represented starts to breathe what you need 

00:00:47.480 --> 00:00:53.690
 making for an elephant that was good for example 

00:00:50.870 --> 00:00:55.730
 what people let it catch is that 

00:00:53.690 --> 00:00:58.850
 let's say caught what let's say cells 

00:00:55.730 --> 00:01:01.250
 works on pro on frequency i don't think that 

00:00:58.850 --> 00:01:03.440
 brain information is transmitted to it purely 

00:01:01.250 --> 00:01:06.710
 the brackets and its k was to share and 

00:01:03.440 --> 00:01:08.630
 structures because it to 

00:01:06.710 --> 00:01:14.660
 register does not mean that there is something 

00:01:08.630 --> 00:01:18.050
 they want that it was never 

00:01:14.660 --> 00:01:18.890
 understanding what is happening begins 

00:01:18.050 --> 00:01:21.080
 make the device 

00:01:18.890 --> 00:01:23.090
 this is the physics that make the devices do not 

00:01:21.080 --> 00:01:24.319
 is taken do not understand in medicine before the doctors 

00:01:23.090 --> 00:01:28.009
 night on it Domenic even know 

00:01:24.319 --> 00:01:29.479
 physiology on the horizontal optics then physics 

00:01:28.009 --> 00:01:31.700
 do not understand anything they often pickup 

00:01:29.479 --> 00:01:32.990
 physical point of view it's heads like 

00:01:31.700 --> 00:01:35.690
 theoretical physicist even had to see 

00:01:32.990 --> 00:01:38.929
 not dress like a normal mindset 

00:01:35.690 --> 00:01:41.690
 purely physical thinking is also not to 

00:01:38.929 --> 00:01:43.759
 broaden your horizons between master 

00:01:41.690 --> 00:01:46.700
 study first biology anton 

00:01:43.759 --> 00:01:48.920
 physiology of procenco cell processes 

00:01:46.700 --> 00:01:52.039
 chemistry appropriate is nobody 

00:01:48.920 --> 00:01:54.920
 does oddly all at once it's that 

00:01:52.039 --> 00:01:56.569
 if they are already educated then this 

00:01:54.920 --> 00:01:58.220
 they need nothing more 

00:01:56.569 --> 00:02:00.470
 can't know anything and everything even though they 

00:01:58.220 --> 00:02:02.050
 sounded only physics example of the beginning 

00:02:00.470 --> 00:02:05.030
 create appliances 

00:02:02.050 --> 00:02:06.410
 You see that gave a magnetic instrument 

00:02:05.030 --> 00:02:08.569
 the publisher gives participation to the magnets and 

00:02:06.410 --> 00:02:11.750
 so on then there is a magnetic field 

00:02:08.569 --> 00:02:13.520
 negative because the magnetic field is given 

00:02:11.750 --> 00:02:16.390
 protect against 

00:02:13.520 --> 00:02:18.770
 imagine cosmic harsh radiations and 

00:02:16.390 --> 00:02:20.840
 charged particles from the sun and protection from 

00:02:18.770 --> 00:02:23.240
 hotel but the second meeting we have done 

00:02:20.840 --> 00:02:23.750
 negative for some reason do we have too 

00:02:23.240 --> 00:02:26.360
 ancestors 

00:02:23.750 --> 00:02:28.880
 go and he processes her and influence 

00:02:26.360 --> 00:02:30.830
 planetary magnetic field also 

00:02:28.880 --> 00:02:33.050
 negatively affects our ion and not 

00:02:30.830 --> 00:02:35.060
 affects slow down moving process 

00:02:33.050 --> 00:02:36.800
 slows down and therefore aging is 

00:02:35.060 --> 00:02:38.240
 faster violations occur more often than 

00:02:36.800 --> 00:02:39.230
 must be and so on but it 

00:02:38.240 --> 00:02:41.450
 imminent evil 

00:02:39.230 --> 00:02:43.820
 that is, the planet essentially exists 

00:02:41.450 --> 00:02:46.520
 Well, when I think that we are normal 

00:02:43.820 --> 00:02:50.330
 chain and do everything well and imagine 

00:02:46.520 --> 00:02:52.730
 when she clings magnet means 

00:02:50.330 --> 00:02:55.100
 cling to blood is dramatically disturbed by what 

00:02:52.730 --> 00:02:59.170
 ion flow going between cells 

00:02:55.100 --> 00:03:01.580
 inside and out of the cells are broken 

00:02:59.170 --> 00:03:03.740
 but many things that are true 

00:03:01.580 --> 00:03:05.990
 just need to be very careful 

00:03:03.740 --> 00:03:07.970
 because unfortunately many tidy 

00:03:05.990 --> 00:03:10.310
 they are created by people who 

00:03:07.970 --> 00:03:12.530
 does not understand that they do not create where 

00:03:10.310 --> 00:03:15.430
 feels just don't retreat yes exactly 

00:03:12.530 --> 00:03:17.959
 type here the elephant you have here is a 

00:03:15.430 --> 00:03:18.940
 elastic soft here we are the point for this 

00:03:17.959 --> 00:03:22.340
 tail 

00:03:18.940 --> 00:03:23.780
 so there is a problem because 

00:03:22.340 --> 00:03:25.340
 can be completely different devices 

00:03:23.780 --> 00:03:29.680
 type but they are arranged completely by 

00:03:25.340 --> 00:03:32.950
 different principle and then and so on 

00:03:29.680 --> 00:03:32.950
 next question
