heartburns<00:02:18.680> so<00:02:18.890> we've<00:02:19.010> got<00:02:19.190> you<00:02:19.640> know<00:02:19.670> noise

00:02:19.960 --> 00:02:19.970 
heartburns so we've got you know noise

00:02:19.970 --> 00:02:22.449 
heartburns so we've got you know noise
canceling<00:02:20.720> them<00:02:20.900> and<00:02:21.050> the<00:02:21.319> volume<00:02:21.769> we've<00:02:22.310> got

00:02:22.449 --> 00:02:22.459 
canceling them and the volume we've got

00:02:22.459 --> 00:02:24.039 
canceling them and the volume we've got
some<00:02:22.610> fast-forward<00:02:23.390> and<00:02:23.510> play<00:02:23.690> there<00:02:23.930> the

00:02:24.039 --> 00:02:24.049 
some fast-forward and play there the

00:02:24.049 --> 00:02:25.509 
some fast-forward and play there the
reason<00:02:24.319> for<00:02:24.440> that<00:02:24.560> is<00:02:24.709> you<00:02:25.190> know<00:02:25.310> if<00:02:25.370> it's

00:02:25.509 --> 00:02:25.519 
reason for that is you know if it's

00:02:25.519 --> 00:02:26.890 
reason for that is you know if it's
tucked<00:02:25.700> in<00:02:25.790> your<00:02:25.879> pocket<00:02:26.269> your<00:02:26.450> commute<00:02:26.750> in

00:02:26.890 --> 00:02:26.900 
tucked in your pocket your commute in

00:02:26.900 --> 00:02:28.240 
tucked in your pocket your commute in
you're<00:02:27.140> out<00:02:27.230> jogging<00:02:27.530> you<00:02:27.860> just<00:02:28.040> want<00:02:28.190> to

00:02:28.240 --> 00:02:28.250 
you're out jogging you just want to

00:02:28.250 --> 00:02:29.619 
you're out jogging you just want to
operate<00:02:28.459> you<00:02:28.670> don't<00:02:28.819> know<00:02:28.970> without<00:02:29.450> your

00:02:29.619 --> 00:02:29.629 
operate you don't know without your

00:02:29.629 --> 00:02:30.610 
operate you don't know without your
pocket<00:02:29.900> every<00:02:30.049> time<00:02:30.230> you<00:02:30.319> want<00:02:30.440> to<00:02:30.470> do

00:02:30.610 --> 00:02:30.620 
pocket every time you want to do

00:02:30.620 --> 00:02:32.199 
pocket every time you want to do
something<00:02:30.980> so<00:02:31.190> that's<00:02:31.549> quite<00:02:31.760> a<00:02:31.819> nice<00:02:31.970> feature

00:02:32.199 --> 00:02:32.209 
something so that's quite a nice feature

00:02:32.209 --> 00:02:33.729 
something so that's quite a nice feature
but<00:02:32.450> most<00:02:32.720> of<00:02:32.930> the<00:02:33.049> controls<00:02:33.409> are<00:02:33.590> done

00:02:33.729 --> 00:02:33.739 
but most of the controls are done

00:02:33.739 --> 00:02:35.410 
but most of the controls are done
through<00:02:33.860> here<00:02:34.159> and<00:02:34.220> it's<00:02:34.700> very<00:02:34.940> very<00:02:35.180> simple

00:02:35.410 --> 00:02:35.420 
through here and it's very very simple

00:02:35.420 --> 00:02:38.050 
through here and it's very very simple
to<00:02:35.660> operate<00:02:35.690> all<00:02:36.620> right<00:02:36.799> and<00:02:36.980> what's<00:02:37.790> the

00:02:38.050 --> 00:02:38.060 
to operate all right and what's the

00:02:38.060 --> 00:02:39.850 
to operate all right and what's the
memory<00:02:38.420> capacity<00:02:38.810> of<00:02:38.840> this<00:02:39.019> it's<00:02:39.500> quite<00:02:39.650> large

00:02:39.850 --> 00:02:39.860 
memory capacity of this it's quite large

00:02:39.860 --> 00:02:42.610 
memory capacity of this it's quite large
really<00:02:40.250> it's<00:02:40.400> 16<00:02:40.849> or<00:02:41.030> 32<00:02:41.510> gigs<00:02:41.840> so<00:02:42.140> that's

00:02:42.610 --> 00:02:42.620 
really it's 16 or 32 gigs so that's

00:02:42.620 --> 00:02:44.229 
really it's 16 or 32 gigs so that's
pretty<00:02:42.890> much<00:02:43.010> equivalent<00:02:43.340> to<00:02:43.700> the<00:02:43.819> touch<00:02:44.030> the

00:02:44.229 --> 00:02:44.239 
pretty much equivalent to the touch the

00:02:44.239 --> 00:02:46.119 
pretty much equivalent to the touch the
touch<00:02:44.420> also<00:02:44.660> has<00:02:44.930> a<00:02:45.079> slightly<00:02:45.470> smaller<00:02:45.769> one

00:02:46.119 --> 00:02:46.129 
touch also has a slightly smaller one

00:02:46.129 --> 00:02:48.729 
touch also has a slightly smaller one
but<00:02:46.340> 16<00:02:47.030> or<00:02:47.150> 32<00:02:47.690> so<00:02:47.900> it<00:02:47.959> will<00:02:48.079> hold<00:02:48.290> most<00:02:48.530> of<00:02:48.680> the

00:02:48.729 --> 00:02:48.739 
but 16 or 32 so it will hold most of the

00:02:48.739 --> 00:02:50.110 
but 16 or 32 so it will hold most of the
songs<00:02:48.950> you<00:02:49.099> gonna<00:02:49.400> want<00:02:49.610> to<00:02:49.670> carry<00:02:49.760> with<00:02:49.909> you

00:02:50.110 --> 00:02:50.120 
songs you gonna want to carry with you

00:02:50.120 --> 00:02:51.130 
songs you gonna want to carry with you
