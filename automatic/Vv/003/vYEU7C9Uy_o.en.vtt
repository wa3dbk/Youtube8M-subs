there<00:00:42.200> when<00:00:43.200> you're<00:00:43.320> doing<00:00:43.500> the<00:00:43.559> game<00:00:43.710> and

00:00:43.880 --> 00:00:43.890 
there when you're doing the game and

00:00:43.890 --> 00:00:47.690 
there when you're doing the game and
everyone's<00:00:44.160> 4<00:00:44.550> bars<00:00:45.379> especially<00:00:46.379> a<00:00:47.070> full<00:00:47.550> game

00:00:47.690 --> 00:00:47.700 
everyone's 4 bars especially a full game

00:00:47.700 --> 00:00:49.310 
everyone's 4 bars especially a full game
this<00:00:48.000> isn't<00:00:48.270> even<00:00:48.329> obviously<00:00:48.840> it's<00:00:49.020> not<00:00:49.110> team

00:00:49.310 --> 00:00:49.320 
this isn't even obviously it's not team

00:00:49.320 --> 00:00:52.639 
this isn't even obviously it's not team
TAC<00:00:49.559> I<00:00:49.710> usually<00:00:50.010> play<00:00:50.190> team<00:00:50.370> TAC<00:00:50.660> but<00:00:51.660> uh<00:00:51.690> this

00:00:52.639 --> 00:00:52.649 
TAC I usually play team TAC but uh this

00:00:52.649 --> 00:00:53.479 
TAC I usually play team TAC but uh this
is<00:00:52.800> mercenary

00:00:53.479 --> 00:00:53.489 
is mercenary

00:00:53.489 --> 00:00:56.869 
is mercenary
I<00:00:53.520> think<00:00:54.170> everyone's<00:00:55.170> four<00:00:55.590> bars<00:00:55.890> first<00:00:56.699> off

00:00:56.869 --> 00:00:56.879 
I think everyone's four bars first off

00:00:56.879 --> 00:00:59.049 
I think everyone's four bars first off
that's<00:00:57.109> that's<00:00:58.109> impossible

00:00:59.049 --> 00:00:59.059 
that's that's impossible

00:00:59.059 --> 00:01:01.430 
that's that's impossible
unless<00:01:00.059> we're<00:01:00.239> all<00:01:00.270> neighbors<00:01:00.660> which<00:01:01.079> is<00:01:01.230> not

00:01:01.430 --> 00:01:01.440 
unless we're all neighbors which is not

00:01:01.440 --> 00:01:04.160 
unless we're all neighbors which is not
the<00:01:01.559> case<00:01:01.739> here<00:01:01.770> and<00:01:02.629> they<00:01:03.629> should<00:01:03.780> always<00:01:03.989> at

00:01:04.160 --> 00:01:04.170 
the case here and they should always at

00:01:04.170 --> 00:01:07.390 
the case here and they should always at
least<00:01:04.320> be<00:01:04.470> a<00:01:04.500> few<00:01:04.830> three<00:01:05.519> bars<00:01:05.760> and<00:01:06.090> shit<00:01:06.270> um

00:01:07.390 --> 00:01:07.400 
least be a few three bars and shit um

00:01:07.400 --> 00:01:09.500 
least be a few three bars and shit um
that<00:01:08.400> should<00:01:08.580> be<00:01:08.670> a<00:01:08.700> sign<00:01:08.970> right<00:01:09.000> there<00:01:09.299> that

00:01:09.500 --> 00:01:09.510 
that should be a sign right there that

00:01:09.510 --> 00:01:14.480 
that should be a sign right there that
the<00:01:10.110> game<00:01:10.290> is<00:01:10.470> just<00:01:10.650> a<00:01:10.920> joke<00:01:11.630> now<00:01:13.100> it's<00:01:14.100> my<00:01:14.340> it's
