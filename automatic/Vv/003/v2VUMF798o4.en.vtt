00:00:03.890 --> 00:00:07.259
 Hello 

00:00:05.250 --> 00:00:10.290
 today we will learn how to do it 

00:00:07.259 --> 00:00:12.030
 combine sauces and meats 

00:00:10.290 --> 00:00:14.280
 the combination of an eye and charge is a 

00:00:12.030 --> 00:00:16.890
 very complicated thing to understand 

00:00:14.280 --> 00:00:19.320
 and if we have to do all this 

00:00:16.890 --> 00:00:21.810
 day to day so often people 

00:00:19.320 --> 00:00:24.420
 Try experimenting and see if it is 

00:00:21.810 --> 00:00:25.740
 Good, or if it's bad, I want to give it to you. 

00:00:24.420 --> 00:00:27.449
 some tips on how we can 

00:00:25.740 --> 00:00:28.470
 combine this without having to stay 

00:00:27.449 --> 00:00:29.789
 testing 

00:00:28.470 --> 00:00:31.800
 first of all the meat that people 

00:00:29.789 --> 00:00:33.410
 more used in the day to day the meat 

00:00:31.800 --> 00:00:36.030
 red all red meats 

00:00:33.410 --> 00:00:38.370
 combine with the eye and has a base of 

00:00:36.030 --> 00:00:39.540
 tomato or a sauce having a base of 

00:00:38.370 --> 00:00:43.170
 meat sauce 

00:00:39.540 --> 00:00:45.600
 between these sauces are the framework sauce 

00:00:43.170 --> 00:00:48.059
 beck to the green pepper sauce with 

00:00:45.600 --> 00:00:49.320
 The dog combines well with the red shirt and 

00:00:48.059 --> 00:00:52.469
 some sauces for example gravy 

00:00:49.320 --> 00:00:54.420
 mustard also goes very well the meat 

00:00:52.469 --> 00:00:56.399
 white mainly chicken meat 

00:00:54.420 --> 00:00:59.129
 blends well with the softest mode 

00:00:56.399 --> 00:01:01.530
 are mothers who will give forth the touch 

00:00:59.129 --> 00:01:03.420
 that she also has or sauces that 

00:01:01.530 --> 00:01:06.270
 contrast with her type sauces more 

00:01:03.420 --> 00:01:09.299
 Lemon sauce the eye with pepper 

00:01:06.270 --> 00:01:10.979
 the same as the mustard sauce 

00:01:09.299 --> 00:01:12.750
 This is an eye that combines super well with 

00:01:10.979 --> 00:01:15.470
 white meat and goes well with any 

00:01:12.750 --> 00:01:17.729
 other preparation you can do 

00:01:15.470 --> 00:01:19.020
 white sauce is an eye that also 

00:01:17.729 --> 00:01:20.939
 fits very well with these meats. 

00:01:19.020 --> 00:01:23.250
 white if you want to mix in the sauce 

00:01:20.939 --> 00:01:25.259
 white a little bit of cheese you do 

00:01:23.250 --> 00:01:26.729
 a sauce four cheeses and will also 

00:01:25.259 --> 00:01:28.500
 Very well with them. 

00:01:26.729 --> 00:01:29.610
 finally we have those faces that 

00:01:28.500 --> 00:01:31.619
 are a bit more complicated than 

00:01:29.610 --> 00:01:33.210
 match as mutton 

00:01:31.619 --> 00:01:35.189
 mutton will always combine 

00:01:33.210 --> 00:01:37.049
 with something that gives a little of that 

00:01:35.189 --> 00:01:40.229
 chew a little perfume she has 

00:01:37.049 --> 00:01:42.720
 strong rosemary type a bit of 

00:01:40.229 --> 00:01:45.180
 basil or that classic combination 

00:01:42.720 --> 00:01:46.740
 than the mint or mint that a 

00:01:45.180 --> 00:01:49.290
 It's really good with this face. 

00:01:46.740 --> 00:01:52.140
 finally the pork she combines 

00:01:49.290 --> 00:01:55.680
 also with more bittersweet things to mix 

00:01:52.140 --> 00:01:58.110
 the acid with the salty one with sweetened and there 

00:01:55.680 --> 00:01:59.790
 the lemon sauce enters again 

00:01:58.110 --> 00:02:02.549
 which matched the chicken too 

00:01:59.790 --> 00:02:04.710
 It combines very well with the point of face 

00:02:02.549 --> 00:02:09.410
 the pig combines with other types of 

00:02:04.710 --> 00:02:11.790
 sauce that has more to dilute is to 

00:02:09.410 --> 00:02:12.720
 fat that she has to have a good look 

00:02:11.790 --> 00:02:14.250
 nice as I like 

00:02:12.720 --> 00:02:16.070
 mix with the body load that I 

00:02:14.250 --> 00:02:18.660
 I always make it a pineapple sauce 

00:02:16.070 --> 00:02:20.640
 pineapple for his ideas for sweetness 

00:02:18.660 --> 00:02:23.270
 ends up very well with that one 

00:02:20.640 --> 00:02:26.220
 face because it helps in digestion too 

00:02:23.270 --> 00:02:28.260
 combination of sauce is experimentation 

00:02:26.220 --> 00:02:30.480
 You may like the tournament tips and 

00:02:28.260 --> 00:02:32.610
 use the instruments and say that 

00:02:30.480 --> 00:02:34.800
 did not do much your taste 

00:02:32.610 --> 00:02:36.660
 The important thing is that you try that you 

00:02:34.800 --> 00:02:39.870
 try and test your own 

00:02:36.660 --> 00:02:42.800
 revenues and thus the combination of 

00:02:39.870 --> 00:02:42.800
 sauces and meats
