00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.389
 Kukayev guys with you draw average 

00:00:01.800 --> 00:00:05.339
 tell you how to call a meteorite 

00:00:03.389 --> 00:00:08.240
 minecraft without any mods when 

00:00:05.339 --> 00:00:10.830
 a single command block Well 

00:00:08.240 --> 00:00:12.929
 for a start I advise you to register a girl 

00:00:10.830 --> 00:00:15.859
 so that all sorts of cracks do not scare your nose 

00:00:12.929 --> 00:00:22.769
 chat write game room 

00:00:15.859 --> 00:00:25.590
 command block out that falls this command 

00:00:22.769 --> 00:00:28.080
 will also be left under the video as we 

00:00:25.590 --> 00:00:29.429
 see the game rules are changed and now 

00:00:28.080 --> 00:00:32.669
 just install and command block 

00:00:29.429 --> 00:00:35.340
 open it we insert it longer 

00:00:32.669 --> 00:00:36.380
 team on which and also left 

00:00:35.340 --> 00:00:41.360
 video link 

00:00:36.380 --> 00:00:45.170
 save and activate the command block 

00:00:41.360 --> 00:00:49.289
 Now we wait for the construction of the machine and 

00:00:45.170 --> 00:00:51.510
 click on the second tablet we got 

00:00:49.289 --> 00:00:56.420
 eggs calling thanks to which we 

00:00:51.510 --> 00:00:59.039
 can call meteor let's try 

00:00:56.420 --> 00:01:03.680
 my main soup on the car and shied 

00:00:59.039 --> 00:01:06.780
 our kind did not seem to hurt people marked here 

00:01:03.680 --> 00:01:10.080
 meteors remains such a crater also 

00:01:06.780 --> 00:01:14.440
 it certainly does development damage 

00:01:10.080 --> 00:01:17.920
 creatures such as cow 

00:01:14.440 --> 00:01:24.010
 we have it so the cows are dead 

00:01:17.920 --> 00:01:27.220
 once and dinosaurs became extinct also 

00:01:24.010 --> 00:01:30.940
 depending on the biome it causes different 

00:01:27.220 --> 00:01:33.430
 damage to the territory and surface because 

00:01:30.940 --> 00:01:35.560
 let's say in the ice house I checked the damage 

00:01:33.430 --> 00:01:37.240
 practically minimal there is small 

00:01:35.560 --> 00:01:40.930
 the krator is well this is natural 

00:01:37.240 --> 00:01:42.790
 because there mostly 

00:01:40.930 --> 00:01:45.520
 we have glued blocks 

00:01:42.790 --> 00:01:48.550
 naturally their density is higher they 

00:01:45.520 --> 00:01:52.180
 more solid we have solid durable and 

00:01:48.550 --> 00:01:56.500
 so they break hard sand we 

00:01:52.180 --> 00:02:00.220
 crumbles very easily so here you are 

00:01:56.500 --> 00:02:02.350
 someone killed and fell experience well well guys 

00:02:00.220 --> 00:02:04.510
