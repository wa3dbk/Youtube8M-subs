00:02:01.259 --> 00:02:03.200 
the solution was to build a diesel
engine<00:02:01.590> that<00:02:01.619> conformed<00:02:02.219> to<00:02:02.250> the<00:02:02.369> 1.5<00:02:02.969> liter

00:02:03.200 --> 00:02:03.210 
engine that conformed to the 1.5 liter

00:02:03.210 --> 00:02:05.510 
engine that conformed to the 1.5 liter
rule<00:02:03.450> was<00:02:03.719> performing<00:02:04.320> nearly<00:02:04.799> as<00:02:04.979> well<00:02:05.219> as<00:02:05.490> a

00:02:05.510 --> 00:02:05.520 
rule was performing nearly as well as a

00:02:05.520 --> 00:02:08.139 
rule was performing nearly as well as a
1.6<00:02:06.210> liter<00:02:06.509> engine<00:02:06.869> that<00:02:07.439> we<00:02:07.590> grew<00:02:07.740> to<00:02:07.890> love
