silver fox and the frost and the other
mutants<00:02:26.590> and<00:02:26.830> he<00:02:27.640> comes<00:02:27.850> out<00:02:27.970> walking<00:02:28.480> them<00:02:28.630> I

00:02:28.740 --> 00:02:28.750 
mutants and he comes out walking them I

00:02:28.750 --> 00:02:31.530 
mutants and he comes out walking them I
thought<00:02:29.050> I<00:02:29.320> heard<00:02:29.680> about<00:02:29.950> his<00:02:30.190> cameo<00:02:30.490> for<00:02:31.390> the

00:02:31.530 --> 00:02:31.540 
thought I heard about his cameo for the

00:02:31.540 --> 00:02:34.140 
thought I heard about his cameo for the
film<00:02:31.810> and<00:02:32.050> I<00:02:32.980> thought<00:02:33.490> he<00:02:33.670> was<00:02:33.820> going<00:02:33.940> to<00:02:34.000> be<00:02:34.120> a

00:02:34.140 --> 00:02:34.150 
film and I thought he was going to be a

00:02:34.150 --> 00:02:36.290 
film and I thought he was going to be a
wheelchair<00:02:34.810> but<00:02:35.020> he<00:02:35.170> was<00:02:35.290> actually<00:02:35.440> walking

00:02:36.290 --> 00:02:36.300 
wheelchair but he was actually walking

00:02:36.300 --> 00:02:39.780 
wheelchair but he was actually walking
which<00:02:37.300> I<00:02:37.600> thought<00:02:37.840> so<00:02:38.650> I'm<00:02:39.010> wondering<00:02:39.520> how<00:02:39.550> to

00:02:39.780 --> 00:02:39.790 
which I thought so I'm wondering how to

00:02:39.790 --> 00:02:41.370 
which I thought so I'm wondering how to
get<00:02:40.000> in<00:02:40.120> the<00:02:40.210> wheelchair<00:02:40.390> maybe<00:02:41.110> it<00:02:41.260> was

00:02:41.370 --> 00:02:41.380 
get in the wheelchair maybe it was

00:02:41.380 --> 00:02:43.470 
get in the wheelchair maybe it was
magneto<00:02:41.860> or<00:02:41.980> something<00:02:42.460> I<00:02:42.610> don't<00:02:42.790> know<00:02:43.000> we'll

00:02:43.470 --> 00:02:43.480 
magneto or something I don't know we'll

00:02:43.480 --> 00:02:45.510 
magneto or something I don't know we'll
have<00:02:43.600> to<00:02:43.660> find<00:02:43.960> out<00:02:44.170> maybe<00:02:44.590> it<00:02:44.860> will<00:02:45.190> tell<00:02:45.220> us

00:02:45.510 --> 00:02:45.520 
have to find out maybe it will tell us

00:02:45.520 --> 00:02:51.600 
have to find out maybe it will tell us
in<00:02:45.940> 2011<00:02:46.840> at<00:02:47.020> x-men<00:02:47.590> origins<00:02:47.830> magneto<00:02:50.010> so<00:02:51.010> that

00:02:51.610 --> 00:02:54.380 
in 2011 at x-men origins magneto so that
is<00:02:51.880> my<00:02:52.120> review<00:02:52.360> on<00:02:52.660> x-men<00:02:53.440> origins<00:02:53.620> wolverine

00:02:54.380 --> 00:02:54.390 
is my review on x-men origins wolverine

00:02:54.390 --> 00:02:59.610 
is my review on x-men origins wolverine
on<00:02:55.830> the<00:02:56.830> IMDb<00:02:57.100> rating<00:02:57.670> is<00:02:58.030> 7.1<00:02:58.840> out<00:02:58.990> of<00:02:59.110> 10<00:02:59.350> i'm

00:02:59.610 --> 00:02:59.620 
on the IMDb rating is 7.1 out of 10 i'm

00:02:59.620 --> 00:03:01.020 
on the IMDb rating is 7.1 out of 10 i'm
going<00:02:59.860> to<00:02:59.920> give<00:02:59.980> this<00:03:00.100> a<00:03:00.430> 10<00:03:00.700> out<00:03:00.850> of<00:03:00.880> 10

00:03:01.020 --> 00:03:01.030 
going to give this a 10 out of 10

00:03:01.030 --> 00:03:03.780 
going to give this a 10 out of 10
because<00:03:01.360> it's<00:03:01.660> very<00:03:01.930> very<00:03:02.260> epic<00:03:02.680> not<00:03:03.400> as<00:03:03.610> good

00:03:03.780 --> 00:03:03.790 
because it's very very epic not as good

00:03:03.790 --> 00:03:05.610 
because it's very very epic not as good
as<00:03:03.850> the<00:03:03.970> dark<00:03:04.300> night<00:03:04.510> though<00:03:04.780> Dark<00:03:05.320> Knight<00:03:05.380> is

00:03:05.610 --> 00:03:05.620 
as the dark night though Dark Knight is

00:03:05.620 --> 00:03:07.020 
as the dark night though Dark Knight is
probably<00:03:05.860> the<00:03:05.950> best<00:03:06.100> superhero<00:03:06.580> movie<00:03:06.910> I've

00:03:07.020 --> 00:03:07.030 
probably the best superhero movie I've

00:03:07.030 --> 00:03:10.350 
probably the best superhero movie I've
ever<00:03:07.120> seen<00:03:07.270> it's<00:03:08.230> not<00:03:08.470> as<00:03:08.710> action<00:03:09.580> packed<00:03:09.610> and

00:03:10.350 --> 00:03:10.360 
ever seen it's not as action packed and

00:03:10.360 --> 00:03:13.140 
ever seen it's not as action packed and
like<00:03:10.600> epic<00:03:11.230> but<00:03:11.710> still<00:03:12.160> the<00:03:12.400> dark<00:03:12.670> knight<00:03:12.850> had

00:03:13.140 --> 00:03:13.150 
like epic but still the dark knight had

00:03:13.150 --> 00:03:16.500 
like epic but still the dark knight had
makes<00:03:13.810> more<00:03:14.110> sense<00:03:14.470> great<00:03:14.950> acting<00:03:15.510> good

00:03:16.500 --> 00:03:16.510 
makes more sense great acting good

00:03:16.510 --> 00:03:19.800 
makes more sense great acting good
action<00:03:16.960> in<00:03:17.140> a<00:03:17.230> great<00:03:17.830> storyline<00:03:18.250> so<00:03:18.910> yeah<00:03:19.270> I'm

00:03:19.800 --> 00:03:19.810 
action in a great storyline so yeah I'm

00:03:19.810 --> 00:03:21.540 
action in a great storyline so yeah I'm
going<00:03:19.900> to<00:03:20.230> have<00:03:20.410> to<00:03:20.440> give<00:03:20.770> the<00:03:20.980> edge<00:03:21.100> to<00:03:21.130> the

00:03:21.540 --> 00:03:21.550 
going to have to give the edge to the

going to have to give the edge to the
