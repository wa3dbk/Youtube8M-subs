00:00:06.770 --> 00:00:10.180 

okay<00:00:07.770> this<00:00:08.160> is<00:00:08.340> a<00:00:08.370> video<00:00:08.730> to<00:00:08.820> record<00:00:09.270> the<00:00:09.809> power

00:00:10.180 --> 00:00:10.190 
okay this is a video to record the power

00:00:10.190 --> 00:00:16.100 
okay this is a video to record the power
readings<00:00:11.690> of<00:00:12.690> a<00:00:12.809> single<00:00:13.170> reef<00:00:13.350> kit<00:00:13.940> and<00:00:15.110> you

00:00:16.100 --> 00:00:16.110 
readings of a single reef kit and you

00:00:16.110 --> 00:00:18.020 
readings of a single reef kit and you
can<00:00:16.260> see<00:00:16.470> we're<00:00:16.680> using<00:00:16.860> an<00:00:17.100> Apogee<00:00:17.580> power

00:00:18.020 --> 00:00:18.030 
can see we're using an Apogee power

00:00:18.030 --> 00:00:21.980 
can see we're using an Apogee power
meter<00:00:18.330> and<00:00:18.800> there's<00:00:19.800> the<00:00:20.039> par<00:00:20.390> on<00:00:21.390> the<00:00:21.600> bottom

00:00:21.980 --> 00:00:21.990 
meter and there's the par on the bottom

00:00:21.990 --> 00:00:29.110 
meter and there's the par on the bottom
of<00:00:22.140> the<00:00:22.230> tank<00:00:22.500> on<00:00:22.830> the<00:00:23.130> sand<00:00:25.400> 155<00:00:26.420> on<00:00:27.420> average

00:00:29.110 --> 00:00:29.120 
of the tank on the sand 155 on average

00:00:29.120 --> 00:00:34.400 
of the tank on the sand 155 on average
let's<00:00:30.120> see<00:00:30.300> it's<00:00:31.309> not<00:00:32.309> quite<00:00:32.820> on<00:00:33.600> the<00:00:33.750> sand<00:00:34.050> and

00:00:34.400 --> 00:00:34.410 
let's see it's not quite on the sand and

00:00:34.410 --> 00:00:37.579 
let's see it's not quite on the sand and
bury<00:00:34.649> it<00:00:34.800> a<00:00:34.920> little<00:00:35.070> bit<00:00:35.280> more<00:00:36.199> that's<00:00:37.199> as<00:00:37.379> low

00:00:37.579 --> 00:00:37.589 
bury it a little bit more that's as low

00:00:37.589 --> 00:00:42.100 
bury it a little bit more that's as low
as<00:00:37.620> I<00:00:37.859> can<00:00:37.890> get<00:00:38.249> it

00:00:42.100 --> 00:00:42.110 

00:00:42.110 --> 00:00:45.040 

essentially<00:00:42.980> the<00:00:43.160> same

00:00:45.040 --> 00:00:45.050 
essentially the same

00:00:45.050 --> 00:00:50.500 
essentially the same
right<00:00:45.680> in<00:00:45.829> the<00:00:45.920> 150<00:00:46.489> 155<00:00:47.000> range<00:00:49.180> now<00:00:50.180> this<00:00:50.450> is

00:00:50.500 --> 00:00:50.510 
right in the 150 155 range now this is

00:00:50.510 --> 00:00:53.319 
right in the 150 155 range now this is
also<00:00:50.840> a<00:00:51.350> little<00:00:51.739> over<00:00:52.100> 12<00:00:52.370> inches<00:00:52.579> this<00:00:53.030> black

00:00:53.319 --> 00:00:53.329 
also a little over 12 inches this black

00:00:53.329 --> 00:00:57.340 
also a little over 12 inches this black
mark<00:00:53.660> here<00:00:54.079> is<00:00:54.260> the<00:00:54.800> 12<00:00:55.070> inch<00:00:55.989> distance<00:00:56.989> mark

00:00:57.340 --> 00:00:57.350 
mark here is the 12 inch distance mark

00:00:57.350 --> 00:01:00.549 
mark here is the 12 inch distance mark
and<00:00:57.710> that's<00:00:58.070> from<00:00:58.430> the<00:00:58.579> mark<00:00:59.110> to<00:01:00.110> the<00:01:00.230> top<00:01:00.530> of

00:01:00.549 --> 00:01:00.559 
and that's from the mark to the top of

00:01:00.559 --> 00:01:07.230 
and that's from the mark to the top of
the<00:01:00.739> sensor<00:01:01.780> so<00:01:02.780> this<00:01:02.930> is<00:01:03.110> about<00:01:04.840> 14<00:01:05.840> inches

00:01:07.230 --> 00:01:07.240 
the sensor so this is about 14 inches

00:01:07.240 --> 00:01:16.590 
the sensor so this is about 14 inches
150<00:01:08.240> car<00:01:09.520> pulling<00:01:10.520> it<00:01:10.700> up<00:01:10.850> to<00:01:10.970> 12<00:01:11.300> inches

00:01:16.590 --> 00:01:16.600 

00:01:16.600 --> 00:01:21.690 

175<00:01:17.600> what<00:01:18.320> average<00:01:19.420> goes<00:01:20.420> up<00:01:20.630> and<00:01:20.750> down

00:01:21.690 --> 00:01:21.700 
175 what average goes up and down

00:01:21.700 --> 00:01:26.679 
175 what average goes up and down
because<00:01:22.700> of<00:01:22.729> the<00:01:23.119> shimmery<00:01:25.359> let's<00:01:26.359> call<00:01:26.569> it

00:01:26.679 --> 00:01:26.689 
because of the shimmery let's call it

00:01:26.689 --> 00:01:31.919 
because of the shimmery let's call it
170<00:01:28.780> here<00:01:29.780> we're<00:01:29.960> going<00:01:30.079> to<00:01:30.140> do<00:01:30.289> six<00:01:30.560> inches

00:01:31.919 --> 00:01:31.929 
170 here we're going to do six inches

00:01:31.929 --> 00:01:35.949 
170 here we're going to do six inches
now<00:01:32.929> the<00:01:33.079> mark<00:01:33.439> is<00:01:34.329> six<00:01:35.329> inches<00:01:35.479> from<00:01:35.810> the

00:01:35.949 --> 00:01:35.959 
now the mark is six inches from the

00:01:35.959 --> 00:01:38.020 
now the mark is six inches from the
sensor<00:01:36.350> to<00:01:36.560> the<00:01:36.590> light<00:01:36.890> or<00:01:37.250> centered<00:01:37.729> under

sensor to the light or centered under
the<00:01:38.149> light<00:01:40.990> and<00:01:41.990> there's<00:01:42.259> the<00:01:42.409> par<00:01:42.799> reading

00:01:48.320 --> 00:01:48.330 

00:01:48.330 --> 00:01:55.970 

about<00:01:49.670> 380<00:01:50.670> on<00:01:51.000> average<00:01:54.440> now<00:01:55.440> at<00:01:55.620> the<00:01:55.740> water

00:01:55.970 --> 00:01:55.980 
about 380 on average now at the water

00:01:55.980 --> 00:01:59.780
