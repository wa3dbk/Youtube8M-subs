00:00:03.520 --> 00:00:07.820
 pints or vandalism graffiti become a social problem when 

00:00:07.819 --> 00:00:12.640
 they are made in unauthorized places such as housing colonies and buildings affecting 

00:00:12.640 --> 00:00:16.560
 with it, third parties are far from being an art 

00:00:16.560 --> 00:00:20.670
 try to make it see groups of young people who are engaged in this type of activity 

00:00:25.539 --> 00:00:29.349
 the sociologist ramón jorge ribolzi specialist with several investigations 

00:00:29.349 --> 00:00:33.040
 in subjects assumes that this problem does not only have to do with teenagers 

00:00:33.040 --> 00:00:37.940
 was legislated back to go naked active gun of the family authorities and those 

00:00:37.940 --> 00:00:41.920
 they make laws to punish those who think illegally says 

00:00:41.920 --> 00:00:46.040
 textually requires a specific function to sanction graffiti artists and 

00:00:46.040 --> 00:00:49.780
 much less when they are minors and the problem is that the graffiti artists to be 

00:00:49.780 --> 00:00:51.400
 minors 2 

00:00:51.400 --> 00:00:55.230
 but why do they do this who project this kind of laws or 

00:00:55.230 --> 00:00:57.750
 regulations because they are unaware of a problem 

00:00:57.750 --> 00:00:59.940
 what is needed 10 

00:00:59.940 --> 00:01:06.190
 that the problem be known in a way academic scientist namús efe from 

00:01:06.190 --> 00:01:10.120
 the institutions that are dedicated to this in the in the state and in the locality 

00:01:10.120 --> 00:01:13.840
 and it is something that has not been done either from the web makers themselves 

00:01:13.840 --> 00:01:14.920
 the defense of america 

00:01:14.920 --> 00:01:17.920
 stresses that after the industries 

00:01:19.260 --> 00:01:23.310
 offer any type of sanction or punishment should receive graffiti 

00:01:23.310 --> 00:01:25.770
 of people who have 

00:01:25.770 --> 00:01:28.770
 liza and even the hands of the police authorities 

00:01:30.070 --> 00:01:33.680
 apply corrective measures for more arrests and raids in the colonies 

00:01:35.180 --> 00:01:39.340
 and that implies an opportunity will be free to continue to stain the city 

00:01:39.340 --> 00:01:42.960
 we are not going to say that they are aware but at least they are not what we believe 

00:01:42.960 --> 00:01:43.940
 What are they 

00:01:43.940 --> 00:01:47.350
 who victimized the activity 

00:01:47.350 --> 00:01:51.090
 because it is an activity that has been carried out without knowing the project 

00:01:51.090 --> 00:01:51.780
 ap 

00:01:51.780 --> 00:01:55.370
 therefore the measures that have been taken are not 

00:01:55.370 --> 00:01:59.830
 the most appropriate according to the reality that is being lived is to say 

00:01:59.830 --> 00:02:01.549
 you do not really know 

00:02:01.549 --> 00:02:05.749
 however decisions are made to make decisions you must first know 

00:02:05.749 --> 00:02:07.990
 and I think that's a lot 

00:02:07.990 --> 00:02:10.560
 for the random cartoonist because it's check 

00:02:10.560 --> 00:02:14.310
 vandalism graffiti is not the proper way to manifest an art and what 

00:02:14.310 --> 00:02:17.730
 dangerous this is that it will continue to manifest itself xxi there is no 

00:02:17.730 --> 00:02:18.839
 coordination 

00:02:18.839 --> 00:02:21.449
 both the attention of parents and authorities 

00:02:21.449 --> 00:02:24.119
 drawings in the middle of the cold head 

00:02:24.119 --> 00:02:27.119
 strengthen with programs and projects so that ethical attitude 

00:02:29.179 --> 00:02:32.619
 keep fighting we insist that they do sport 

00:02:32.619 --> 00:02:36.119
 why do they practice their cultural artistic talents 

00:02:37.259 --> 00:02:38.899
 social 

00:02:38.899 --> 00:02:41.889
 this closer to them 

00:02:41.889 --> 00:02:46.609
 This one makes me think that there are groups that have made efforts to 

00:02:47.599 --> 00:02:48.949
 those efforts 

00:02:48.949 --> 00:02:51.949
 I would have to pay more attention to young people 

00:02:53.189 --> 00:02:55.129
 so that this one 

00:02:55.129 --> 00:02:56.829
 so that they understand 

00:02:56.829 --> 00:02:59.789
 mysticism and other languages 

00:02:59.789 --> 00:03:02.829
 most important with which they can 

00:03:02.829 --> 00:03:05.309
 manifest their dissatisfaction 

00:03:05.309 --> 00:03:06.320
 lemoniez 

00:03:06.320 --> 00:03:10.590

00:03:10.590 --> 00:03:15.040
 series of reports of vandalism graffiti fed up crime a world 

00:03:15.040 --> 00:03:15.869

00:03:15.869 --> 00:03:17.329
