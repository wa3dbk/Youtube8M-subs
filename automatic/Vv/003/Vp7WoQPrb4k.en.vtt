anyway getting back to it I'm going

00:00:43.460 --> 00:00:45.910 
anyway getting back to it I'm going
through<00:00:43.700> these<00:00:43.910> projects<00:00:44.690> and<00:00:44.960> I'm<00:00:45.380> adding<00:00:45.770> my

00:00:45.910 --> 00:00:45.920 
through these projects and I'm adding my

00:00:45.920 --> 00:00:48.490 
through these projects and I'm adding my
own<00:00:45.950> little<00:00:46.370> spice<00:00:46.640> to<00:00:46.880> each<00:00:47.030> of<00:00:47.270> them

00:00:48.490 --> 00:00:48.500 
own little spice to each of them

00:00:48.500 --> 00:00:51.010 
own little spice to each of them
and<00:00:49.220> obviously<00:00:49.880> experimenting<00:00:50.840> with

00:00:51.010 --> 00:00:51.020 
and obviously experimenting with

00:00:51.020 --> 00:00:53.200 
and obviously experimenting with
different<00:00:51.680> variations<00:00:51.800> of<00:00:52.370> the<00:00:52.520> software<00:00:53.000> so

00:00:53.200 --> 00:00:53.210 
different variations of the software so

00:00:53.210 --> 00:00:55.150 
different variations of the software so
that<00:00:53.360> I<00:00:53.390> can<00:00:53.600> familiarize<00:00:53.930> myself<00:00:54.170> with<00:00:54.650> the

00:00:55.150 --> 00:00:55.160 
that I can familiarize myself with the

00:00:55.160 --> 00:00:57.190 
that I can familiarize myself with the
code<00:00:55.550> and<00:00:55.790> really<00:00:56.060> understand<00:00:56.540> how

00:00:57.190 --> 00:00:57.200 
code and really understand how

00:00:57.200 --> 00:00:59.560 
code and really understand how
everything's<00:00:57.650> working<00:00:58.070> anyhow<00:00:58.790> the<00:00:58.850> project

I've got red now I can switch those

00:01:38.719 --> 00:01:41.980 
I've got red now I can switch those
values<00:01:39.109> around<00:01:39.229> relatively<00:01:39.950> easily<00:01:40.100> but<00:01:40.990> I'm

00:01:41.980 --> 00:01:41.990 
values around relatively easily but I'm

00:01:41.990 --> 00:01:44.889 
values around relatively easily but I'm
not<00:01:42.170> going<00:01:42.469> to<00:01:42.530> so<00:01:43.399> what<00:01:44.359> I've<00:01:44.479> got<00:01:44.630> right<00:01:44.869> here

00:01:44.889 --> 00:01:44.899 
not going to so what I've got right here

00:01:44.899 --> 00:01:48.160 
not going to so what I've got right here
is<00:01:45.139> just<00:01:45.499> a<00:01:45.649> single<00:01:46.159> triple-a<00:01:46.549> battery<00:01:47.170> I'm

eight<00:02:15.080> seven<00:02:15.439> volts<00:02:15.799> DC<00:02:15.980> so<00:02:16.909> it<00:02:17.180> looks<00:02:17.330> like

00:02:17.410 --> 00:02:17.420 
eight seven volts DC so it looks like

00:02:17.420 --> 00:02:18.530 
eight seven volts DC so it looks like
it's<00:02:17.599> working<00:02:17.780> well<00:02:18.019> enough

00:02:18.530 --> 00:02:18.540 
it's working well enough

00:02:18.540 --> 00:02:19.940 
it's working well enough

00:02:44.690 --> 00:02:44.700 
shorter thicker wires because there are

test<00:02:50.970> right<00:02:51.150> here<00:02:51.180> so<00:02:51.480> I've<00:02:51.569> got<00:02:51.650> 0.6<00:02:52.650> volts<00:02:52.950> of

00:02:53.030 --> 00:02:53.040

test right here so I've got 0.6 volts of
the<00:02:53.129> input<00:02:53.459> right<00:02:54.030> now<00:02:54.209> at<00:02:54.450> the<00:02:54.599> at<00:02:55.470> a<00:02:56.129> input<00:02:56.760> a

00:02:56.869 --> 00:02:56.879 
the input right now at the at a input a

00:02:56.879 --> 00:03:01.759 
the input right now at the at a input a
0<00:02:57.180> so<00:02:57.750> analog<00:02:58.290> input<00:02:58.950> a<00:02:59.159> 0<00:02:59.190> and<00:02:59.750> I<00:03:00.750> get<00:03:00.810> less

00:03:01.759 --> 00:03:01.769 
0 so analog input a 0 and I get less

00:03:01.769 --> 00:03:03.589 
0 so analog input a 0 and I get less
than<00:03:02.010> 1<00:03:02.190> point<00:03:02.370> 4<00:03:02.639> volts<00:03:02.670> so<00:03:03.359> I'm<00:03:03.420> going<00:03:03.540> to

00:03:03.589 --> 00:03:03.599 
than 1 point 4 volts so I'm going to

00:03:03.599 --> 00:03:05.420 
than 1 point 4 volts so I'm going to
bring<00:03:03.690> it<00:03:03.810> up<00:03:03.900> to<00:03:03.930> 1.3<00:03:04.530> volts<00:03:05.040> and<00:03:05.159> we'll<00:03:05.280> try

00:03:05.420 --> 00:03:05.430 
bring it up to 1.3 volts and we'll try

00:03:05.430 --> 00:03:10.720 
bring it up to 1.3 volts and we'll try
it<00:03:05.459> again<00:03:05.579> XPO<00:03:06.060> still<00:03:06.299> expect<00:03:06.599> to<00:03:06.629> see<00:03:06.840> red<00:03:08.840> yep

00:03:10.720 --> 00:03:10.730 
it again XPO still expect to see red yep

00:03:10.730 --> 00:03:16.720 
it again XPO still expect to see red yep
so<00:03:11.730> now<00:03:11.849> when<00:03:11.970> I<00:03:12.000> bring<00:03:12.060> it<00:03:12.239> to<00:03:12.329> 1.5<00:03:12.930> volts<00:03:14.420> nice

00:03:16.720 --> 00:03:16.730 
so now when I bring it to 1.5 volts nice

00:03:16.730 --> 00:03:20.509 
so now when I bring it to 1.5 volts nice
now<00:03:17.730> unfortunately<00:03:18.420> the<00:03:19.430> resolution<00:03:20.430> of<00:03:20.489> my

00:03:20.509 --> 00:03:20.519 
now unfortunately the resolution of my

00:03:20.519 --> 00:03:26.089 
now unfortunately the resolution of my
power<00:03:20.760> supply<00:03:21.030> is<00:03:24.019> very<00:03:25.019> very<00:03:25.379> low<00:03:25.620> so<00:03:25.829> I<00:03:25.859> can

00:03:26.089 --> 00:03:26.099 
power supply is very very low so I can

00:03:26.099 --> 00:03:27.920 
power supply is very very low so I can
only<00:03:26.190> go<00:03:26.370> to<00:03:26.400> 1<00:03:26.609> point<00:03:26.790> 6<00:03:27.000> volts<00:03:27.120> this<00:03:27.690> will<00:03:27.840> be

00:03:27.920 --> 00:03:27.930 
only go to 1 point 6 volts this will be

00:03:27.930 --> 00:03:29.300 
only go to 1 point 6 volts this will be
right<00:03:28.079> on<00:03:28.139> the<00:03:28.349> threshold<00:03:28.620> I<00:03:28.919> don't<00:03:29.069> know<00:03:29.190> how

00:03:29.300 --> 00:03:29.310 
right on the threshold I don't know how

00:03:29.310 --> 00:03:31.699 
right on the threshold I don't know how
this<00:03:29.459> is<00:03:29.519> going<00:03:29.730> to<00:03:29.790> go<00:03:29.970> yeah<00:03:30.870> so<00:03:31.109> 1<00:03:31.260> point<00:03:31.530> 6

00:03:31.699 --> 00:03:31.709 
this is going to go yeah so 1 point 6

00:03:31.709 --> 00:03:35.360 
this is going to go yeah so 1 point 6
volts<00:03:31.829> that's<00:03:32.459> at<00:03:32.790> actually<00:03:33.620> perfect<00:03:34.620> so<00:03:35.220> this

00:03:35.360 --> 00:03:35.370 
volts that's at actually perfect so this

00:03:35.370 --> 00:03:38.390 
volts that's at actually perfect so this
is<00:03:35.489> just<00:03:35.639> simulating<00:03:36.480> a<00:03:36.660> battery<00:03:37.290> and<00:03:37.560> the

what's<00:04:15.780> going<00:04:15.900> to<00:04:15.930> happen<00:04:16.260> is<00:04:16.380> I'm<00:04:16.470> going<00:04:16.590> to

00:04:16.640 --> 00:04:16.650 
what's going to happen is I'm going to

00:04:16.650 --> 00:04:17.810 
what's going to happen is I'm going to
press<00:04:16.799> the<00:04:16.889> button<00:04:16.949> it's<00:04:17.280> going<00:04:17.370> to<00:04:17.459> have<00:04:17.609> more

00:04:17.810 --> 00:04:17.820 
press the button it's going to have more

00:04:17.820 --> 00:04:19.670 
press the button it's going to have more
than<00:04:17.880> one<00:04:18.150> point<00:04:18.389> six<00:04:18.599> volts<00:04:18.930> on<00:04:19.049> it<00:04:19.199> and<00:04:19.590> so

00:04:19.670 --> 00:04:19.680 
than one point six volts on it and so

00:04:19.680 --> 00:04:21.110 
than one point six volts on it and so
I'm<00:04:19.739> going<00:04:19.889> to<00:04:19.949> see<00:04:20.039> a<00:04:20.070> green<00:04:20.310> LED<00:04:20.459> so<00:04:20.970> that

00:04:21.110 --> 00:04:21.120 
I'm going to see a green LED so that

00:04:21.120 --> 00:04:23.779 
I'm going to see a green LED so that
pulldown<00:04:21.449> resistor<00:04:21.959> it's<00:04:22.650> helpful<00:04:22.919> in<00:04:23.639> any

00:04:23.779 --> 00:04:23.789 
pulldown resistor it's helpful in any

00:04:23.789 --> 00:04:27.469 
pulldown resistor it's helpful in any
case<00:04:24.090> I'm<00:04:24.990> going<00:04:25.199> to<00:04:25.260> put<00:04:25.409> the<00:04:25.940> the<00:04:26.940> code<00:04:27.150> below

case I'm going to put the the code below

00:04:27.479 --> 00:04:29.060 
case I'm going to put the the code below
and<00:04:27.750> commented<00:04:28.260> I<00:04:28.349> comment<00:04:28.710> the<00:04:28.800> heck<00:04:28.919> out<00:04:29.039> of
