right rein with the inside ring the left
rein<00:00:34.079> here<00:00:34.440> is<00:00:34.890> the<00:00:35.130> supporting<00:00:35.670> ring<00:00:35.820> if<00:00:36.030> I

00:00:36.139 --> 00:00:36.149 
rein here is the supporting ring if I

00:00:36.149 --> 00:00:38.450 
rein here is the supporting ring if I
didn't<00:00:36.570> hold<00:00:36.750> it<00:00:36.930> a<00:00:36.989> certain<00:00:37.200> way<00:00:37.380> he<00:00:38.190> just

00:00:38.450 --> 00:00:38.460 
didn't hold it a certain way he just

didn't hold it a certain way he just
turned<00:00:38.700> around<00:00:38.850> say<00:00:39.360> so<00:00:40.260> that's<00:00:40.470> why<00:00:40.590> it's

00:00:40.730 --> 00:00:40.740 
turned around say so that's why it's

00:00:40.740 --> 00:00:44.210 
turned around say so that's why it's
called<00:00:40.770> the<00:00:41.070> supporting<00:00:41.610> ring<00:00:42.500> look<00:00:43.500> take<00:00:44.190> a

00:00:44.210 --> 00:00:44.220 
called the supporting ring look take a

00:00:44.220 --> 00:00:51.080 
called the supporting ring look take a
hold<00:00:44.520> of<00:00:44.670> it<00:00:44.730> and<00:00:48.470> the<00:00:49.470> supporting<00:00:49.980> rain<00:00:50.220> who

hold of it and the supporting rain who

00:00:51.090 --> 00:00:53.600 
hold of it and the supporting rain who
actually<00:00:51.980> descriptive<00:00:52.980> supporting<00:00:53.430> lee<00:00:53.550> is

00:00:53.600 --> 00:00:53.610 
actually descriptive supporting lee is

00:00:53.610 --> 00:00:56.270 
actually descriptive supporting lee is
kind<00:00:53.850> of<00:00:53.940> like<00:00:54.060> a<00:00:54.120> steering<00:00:54.780> wheel<00:00:54.920> this<00:00:55.920> rate

00:00:56.270 --> 00:00:56.280

step is to walk down the fence you know
the<00:02:48.769> imaginary<00:02:49.370> fence<00:02:50.620> remember<00:02:51.620> he<00:02:51.680> does<00:02:51.889> it

00:02:52.030 --> 00:02:52.040 
the imaginary fence remember he does it

00:02:52.040 --> 00:02:59.550 
the imaginary fence remember he does it
both<00:02:52.220> ways<00:02:52.870> whoa<00:02:53.870> stop<00:02:56.170> turn<00:02:57.170> the<00:02:57.349> other<00:02:57.500> way

00:02:59.550 --> 00:02:59.560 
both ways whoa stop turn the other way

00:02:59.560 --> 00:03:05.770 
both ways whoa stop turn the other way
go<00:03:00.560> like<00:03:00.799> that<00:03:01.720> away<00:03:02.720> from<00:03:02.780> the<00:03:03.200> fence<00:03:04.569> you<00:03:05.569> see

00:03:05.770 --> 00:03:05.780

to where eventually you don't have to
stop<00:04:13.250> to<00:04:14.250> you<00:04:14.910> know<00:04:15.030> to<00:04:15.090> change<00:04:16.040> change<00:04:17.150> bins

00:04:18.140 --> 00:04:18.150 
stop to you know to change change bins

00:04:18.150 --> 00:04:21.979 
stop to you know to change change bins
you<00:04:19.580> don't<00:04:20.580> have<00:04:20.760> to<00:04:20.940> stop<00:04:21.210> you<00:04:21.420> can<00:04:21.570> just<00:04:21.750> walk

you don't have to stop you can just walk

00:04:21.989 --> 00:04:26.270 
you don't have to stop you can just walk
down<00:04:22.260> there<00:04:22.910> like<00:04:23.910> this<00:04:24.300> and<00:04:24.890> then<00:04:25.890> change

00:04:26.270 --> 00:04:26.280 
down there like this and then change

00:04:26.280 --> 00:04:32.810 
down there like this and then change
over<00:04:26.640> like<00:04:26.820> this<00:04:27.800> like<00:04:28.800> this<00:04:31.460> then<00:04:32.460> the<00:04:32.640> next

00:04:40.490 --> 00:04:40.500 
the fence and he's Ben's pretty way up

00:04:40.500 --> 00:04:43.220 
the fence and he's Ben's pretty way up
but<00:04:40.740> Bree<00:04:41.040> way<00:04:41.190> is<00:04:41.370> to<00:04:41.850> hold<00:04:42.180> that<00:04:42.480> supporting

00:04:43.220 --> 00:04:43.230 
but Bree way is to hold that supporting

00:04:43.230 --> 00:04:48.260 
but Bree way is to hold that supporting
rain<00:04:43.470> and<00:04:43.830> ask<00:04:44.900> beg<00:04:46.340> kajal<00:04:47.340> to<00:04:47.850> get<00:04:48.030> him<00:04:48.150> to

rain and ask beg kajal to get him to

00:04:48.270 --> 00:04:50.600 
rain and ask beg kajal to get him to
move<00:04:48.420> sideways<00:04:49.080> a<00:04:49.350> little<00:04:49.620> bit<00:04:50.040> that<00:04:50.370> works

00:04:50.600 --> 00:04:50.610 
move sideways a little bit that works

00:04:50.610 --> 00:04:54.680 
move sideways a little bit that works
too<00:04:52.070> just<00:04:53.070> you<00:04:53.400> know<00:04:53.430> whatever<00:04:53.730> it<00:04:54.060> takes<00:04:54.390> and

00:04:54.680 --> 00:04:54.690 
too just you know whatever it takes and

00:04:54.690 --> 00:04:56.750 
too just you know whatever it takes and
and<00:04:55.230> he<00:04:55.410> won't<00:04:55.620> do<00:04:55.830> a<00:04:55.860> lot<00:04:56.160> it<00:04:56.370> might<00:04:56.550> be<00:04:56.730> just

00:04:56.750 --> 00:04:56.760 
and he won't do a lot it might be just

00:04:56.760 --> 00:04:59.570 
and he won't do a lot it might be just
one<00:04:57.300> staggered<00:04:57.990> step<00:04:58.380> off<00:04:58.650> to<00:04:58.920> the<00:04:59.040> right<00:04:59.250> and

00:04:59.570 --> 00:04:59.580 
one staggered step off to the right and

00:04:59.580 --> 00:05:03.010 
one staggered step off to the right and
what<00:05:00.480> I'm<00:05:00.600> let<00:05:01.200> me<00:05:01.320> tell<00:05:01.530> explain<00:05:01.980> that<00:05:02.160> again

00:05:03.010 --> 00:05:03.020 
what I'm let me tell explain that again

00:05:03.020 --> 00:05:05.840

is<00:05:06.030> the<00:05:06.180> one<00:05:06.360> that's<00:05:06.540> not<00:05:06.810> doing<00:05:07.050> the<00:05:07.140> checking

00:05:07.550 --> 00:05:07.560 
is the one that's not doing the checking
