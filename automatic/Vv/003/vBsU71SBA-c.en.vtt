 hello now i will show you how 

00:00:09.870 --> 00:00:13.500
 properly set up the digital

 will move the metal grate to 

00:00:48.239 --> 00:00:52.190
 the indicator is displayed 

00:00:58.190 --> 00:01:01.910
 the regulator is equipped with a backlight 

00:01:10.580 --> 00:01:19.920
 connect the thermostat terminals 

00:01:15.170 --> 00:01:21.299
 a twelve volt battery in 

00:01:19.920 --> 00:01:24.479
 In this case, I will use 

00:01:21.299 --> 00:01:26.310
 a small household battery pay 

00:01:24.479 --> 00:01:29.220
 connection attention can be made 

00:01:26.310 --> 00:01:31.040
 correctly the red terminal is attached to 

00:01:29.220 --> 00:01:34.880
 plus 

00:01:31.040 --> 00:01:34.880
 attic lem to minus 

00:01:39.799 --> 00:01:46.909
 to change the temperature of the interval 

00:01:42.750 --> 00:01:49.560
 a roll of eggs push the button 1 and 

00:01:46.909 --> 00:01:52.229
 hold it for some time about 1 

00:01:49.560 --> 00:01:54.630
 2 seconds of flashing digit indicates that 

00:01:52.229 --> 00:01:57.140
 tempera thermostat switched to mode 

00:01:54.630 --> 00:02:01.429

00:02:01.429 --> 00:02:09.330
 buttons 2 and 3 can be reduced or 

00:02:05.189 --> 00:02:13.620
 increase temperature button 2 

00:02:09.330 --> 00:02:22.849
 decreases button 3 increases 

00:02:13.620 --> 00:02:22.849
 temperature press button 1 again 

00:02:24.260 --> 00:02:30.599
 Now you can set the time between 

00:02:27.209 --> 00:02:34.620
 flip eggs from 0 to 8 hours 

00:02:30.599 --> 00:02:38.610

00:02:42.500 --> 00:02:48.170
 egg flip interval button 

00:02:44.880 --> 00:02:51.840
 exaggerates button 2 reduces 

00:02:48.170 --> 00:02:55.319
 notice when the indicator 

00:02:51.840 --> 00:02:56.880
 shows two zeroes of value it says 

00:02:55.319 --> 00:02:59.510
 that the device coup 

00:02:56.880 --> 00:02:59.510
 is disabled 

00:03:02.000 --> 00:03:09.260

00:03:13.549 --> 00:03:20.000
 temperature and interval of egg flip 

00:03:17.450 --> 00:03:22.859
 if you have a digital thermostat 

00:03:20.000 --> 00:03:25.019
 humidity measurement function then 

00:03:22.859 --> 00:03:28.200
 indicator alternately displayed 

00:03:25.019 --> 00:03:30.870
 incubation temperature about 45 seconds 

00:03:28.200 --> 00:03:33.470
 for an hour then the value of humidity in 

00:03:30.870 --> 00:03:33.470
 an incubator 

00:03:35.569 --> 00:03:44.650
 hold press and hold button 3 

00:03:39.189 --> 00:03:44.650
 will show the humidity value at any time 

00:03:45.969 --> 00:03:50.349
 at shutdown of supply voltage 220 

00:03:49.939 --> 00:03:53.000

00:03:50.349 --> 00:03:55.069
 after one or two seconds the incubator 

00:03:53.000 --> 00:04:01.150
 automatically switch to powered by

 220 volts 

00:04:28.419 --> 00:04:32.840
 pay attention during long work 

00:04:30.620 --> 00:04:35.050
 battery incubator needed 

00:04:32.840 --> 00:04:38.389

00:04:35.050 --> 00:04:42.740
 in the mode of operation from the mains 220 volts 

00:04:38.389 --> 00:04:45.099
 the battery is not discharging all the best 

00:04:42.740 --> 00:04:45.099
