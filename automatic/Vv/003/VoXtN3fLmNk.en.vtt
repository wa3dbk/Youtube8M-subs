okay<00:00:11.950> I<00:00:11.980> thought<00:00:12.309> I'd<00:00:12.429> take<00:00:12.610> some<00:00:12.849> time<00:00:13.090> to

00:00:13.289 --> 00:00:13.299 
okay I thought I'd take some time to

00:00:13.299 --> 00:00:15.720 
okay I thought I'd take some time to
show<00:00:13.510> you<00:00:13.570> some<00:00:14.049> unique<00:00:14.410> features<00:00:14.440> about<00:00:15.040> the

00:00:15.720 --> 00:00:15.730 
show you some unique features about the

00:00:15.730 --> 00:00:19.800 
show you some unique features about the
garage<00:00:16.390> slalom<00:00:17.170> truck<00:00:17.470> an<00:00:17.820> ldp<00:00:18.820> truck<00:00:19.119> which

00:00:19.800 --> 00:00:19.810 
garage slalom truck an ldp truck which

00:00:19.810 --> 00:00:20.940 
garage slalom truck an ldp truck which
are<00:00:19.960> essentially<00:00:20.410> the<00:00:20.470> same<00:00:20.529> but<00:00:20.919> different

00:00:20.940 --> 00:00:20.950 
are essentially the same but different

00:00:20.950 --> 00:00:23.429 
are essentially the same but different
widths<00:00:21.610> slightly<00:00:22.029> different<00:00:22.360> angles<00:00:22.689> first

00:00:23.429 --> 00:00:23.439 
widths slightly different angles first

00:00:23.439 --> 00:00:26.480 
widths slightly different angles first
thing<00:00:23.740> is<00:00:23.950> this<00:00:24.720> uniquely<00:00:25.720> machined

00:00:26.480 --> 00:00:26.490 
thing is this uniquely machined

00:00:26.490 --> 00:00:30.420 
thing is this uniquely machined
spherical<00:00:28.289> bearing<00:00:29.289> and<00:00:29.560> what<00:00:29.740> we<00:00:29.859> do<00:00:30.070> is<00:00:30.250> we

00:00:30.420 --> 00:00:30.430 
spherical bearing and what we do is we

00:00:30.430 --> 00:00:32.880 
spherical bearing and what we do is we
machine<00:00:31.179> a<00:00:31.210> scallop<00:00:31.810> out<00:00:32.140> I<00:00:32.199> hope<00:00:32.590> you<00:00:32.739> can

00:00:32.880 --> 00:00:32.890 
machine a scallop out I hope you can

00:00:32.890 --> 00:00:35.729 
machine a scallop out I hope you can
just<00:00:33.070> see<00:00:33.280> this<00:00:33.489> we'll<00:00:34.180> just<00:00:34.390> try<00:00:35.230> and<00:00:35.290> rotate

00:00:35.729 --> 00:00:35.739 
just see this we'll just try and rotate

00:00:35.739 --> 00:00:39.090 
just see this we'll just try and rotate
this<00:00:35.920> round<00:00:36.250> to<00:00:36.970> show<00:00:37.180> you<00:00:37.239> just<00:00:37.870> here<00:00:38.350> on<00:00:38.530> this

00:00:39.090 --> 00:00:39.100 
this round to show you just here on this

00:00:39.100 --> 00:00:41.610 
this round to show you just here on this
face<00:00:39.430> and<00:00:39.730> on<00:00:40.030> the<00:00:40.239> opposite<00:00:40.780> diagonal<00:00:41.019> face

00:00:41.610 --> 00:00:41.620 
face and on the opposite diagonal face

00:00:41.620 --> 00:00:44.610 
face and on the opposite diagonal face
what<00:00:42.550> this<00:00:42.760> does<00:00:43.120> is<00:00:43.449> when<00:00:43.720> placed<00:00:44.080> inside<00:00:44.559> the

00:00:44.610 --> 00:00:44.620 
what this does is when placed inside the

00:00:44.620 --> 00:00:47.250 
what this does is when placed inside the
hangar<00:00:45.159> in<00:00:45.519> line<00:00:46.180> with<00:00:46.510> the<00:00:46.690> scallops

00:00:47.250 --> 00:00:47.260 
hangar in line with the scallops

00:00:47.260 --> 00:00:50.789 
hangar in line with the scallops
machined<00:00:47.710> into<00:00:47.890> the<00:00:48.129> hangar<00:00:49.019> it<00:00:50.019> allows<00:00:50.350> us<00:00:50.379> to

00:00:50.789 --> 00:00:50.799 
machined into the hangar it allows us to

00:00:50.799 --> 00:00:54.000 
machined into the hangar it allows us to
put<00:00:51.129> this<00:00:51.309> hang<00:00:51.580> up<00:00:51.760> over<00:00:52.330> the<00:00:52.420> top<00:00:52.659> of<00:00:53.010> this

00:00:54.000 --> 00:00:54.010 
put this hang up over the top of this

00:00:54.010 --> 00:00:56.100 
put this hang up over the top of this
regular<00:00:54.670> grade<00:00:54.909> 8<00:00:55.119> king<00:00:55.449> pin<00:00:55.690> on<00:00:55.839> the<00:00:55.869> base

00:00:56.100 --> 00:00:56.110 
regular grade 8 king pin on the base

00:00:56.110 --> 00:00:58.469 
regular grade 8 king pin on the base
plate<00:00:56.379> without<00:00:57.220> either<00:00:57.610> having<00:00:58.119> to<00:00:58.299> make<00:00:58.449> a

00:00:58.469 --> 00:00:58.479 
plate without either having to make a

00:00:58.479 --> 00:01:01.770 
plate without either having to make a
special<00:00:59.290> king<00:00:59.890> pin<00:01:00.330> which<00:01:01.330> you<00:01:01.510> have<00:01:01.629> to

00:01:01.770 --> 00:01:01.780 
special king pin which you have to

00:01:01.780 --> 00:01:05.039 
special king pin which you have to
remove<00:01:02.080> or<00:01:02.729> one<00:01:03.729> that<00:01:03.879> is<00:01:03.939> slightly<00:01:04.600> narrower

00:01:05.039 --> 00:01:05.049 
remove or one that is slightly narrower

00:01:05.049 --> 00:01:09.390 
remove or one that is slightly narrower
at<00:01:05.229> the<00:01:05.350> top<00:01:06.180> so<00:01:07.180> it<00:01:07.450> just<00:01:07.689> saves<00:01:07.930> time<00:01:08.400> money

00:01:09.390 --> 00:01:09.400 
at the top so it just saves time money

00:01:09.400 --> 00:01:12.090 
at the top so it just saves time money
and<00:01:09.700> we<00:01:10.330> feel<00:01:10.570> the<00:01:10.720> grade<00:01:10.930> eights<00:01:11.170> are<00:01:11.470> the

00:01:12.090 --> 00:01:12.100 
and we feel the grade eights are the

00:01:12.100 --> 00:01:15.149 
and we feel the grade eights are the
strongest<00:01:12.549> kingpins<00:01:13.090> out<00:01:13.299> there<00:01:13.600> and<00:01:13.930> if<00:01:14.680> one

00:01:15.149 --> 00:01:15.159 
strongest kingpins out there and if one

00:01:15.159 --> 00:01:17.249 
strongest kingpins out there and if one
should<00:01:15.460> break<00:01:15.789> you<00:01:16.210> can<00:01:16.420> get<00:01:16.869> it<00:01:16.990> at<00:01:17.079> any

00:01:17.249 --> 00:01:17.259 
should break you can get it at any

00:01:17.259 --> 00:01:20.190 
should break you can get it at any
regular<00:01:17.770> hardware<00:01:18.219> store<00:01:18.689> the<00:01:19.689> next<00:01:19.840> point

00:01:20.190 --> 00:01:20.200 
regular hardware store the next point

00:01:20.200 --> 00:01:25.580 
regular hardware store the next point
that<00:01:20.500> we<00:01:20.590> developed<00:01:21.130> is<00:01:21.700> this<00:01:22.479> axle<00:01:23.229> system<00:01:24.119> we

00:01:25.580 --> 00:01:25.590 
that we developed is this axle system we

00:01:25.590 --> 00:01:28.499 
that we developed is this axle system we
wanted<00:01:26.590> to<00:01:26.679> try<00:01:26.890> something<00:01:26.920> unique<00:01:27.609> and<00:01:27.880> we

00:01:28.499 --> 00:01:28.509 
wanted to try something unique and we

00:01:28.509 --> 00:01:30.690 
wanted to try something unique and we
found<00:01:28.780> that<00:01:28.929> the<00:01:29.229> wheels<00:01:29.799> work<00:01:30.219> really

00:01:30.690 --> 00:01:30.700 
found that the wheels work really

00:01:30.700 --> 00:01:33.359 
found that the wheels work really
smoothly<00:01:31.240> on<00:01:31.479> this<00:01:31.719> axle<00:01:32.109> system<00:01:32.530> you'll<00:01:33.100> see

00:01:33.359 --> 00:01:33.369 
smoothly on this axle system you'll see

00:01:33.369 --> 00:01:38.010 
smoothly on this axle system you'll see
that<00:01:33.549> we<00:01:33.700> have<00:01:33.729> a<00:01:36.030> built-in<00:01:37.030> speed<00:01:37.509> ring<00:01:37.840> in

00:01:38.010 --> 00:01:38.020 
that we have a built-in speed ring in

00:01:38.020 --> 00:01:40.230 
that we have a built-in speed ring in
effect<00:01:38.350> here<00:01:38.740> so<00:01:39.070> you<00:01:39.130> don't<00:01:39.219> need<00:01:39.700> a<00:01:39.729> washer

00:01:40.230 --> 00:01:40.240 
effect here so you don't need a washer

00:01:40.240 --> 00:01:43.109 
effect here so you don't need a washer
on<00:01:40.450> this<00:01:40.689> side<00:01:40.960> and<00:01:41.740> on<00:01:41.890> our<00:01:42.100> axles<00:01:42.579> underneath

00:01:43.109 --> 00:01:43.119 
on this side and on our axles underneath

00:01:43.119 --> 00:01:46.169 
on this side and on our axles underneath
the<00:01:43.420> head<00:01:43.630> we<00:01:44.200> also<00:01:44.380> machine<00:01:44.920> a<00:01:44.950> speed<00:01:45.340> ring<00:01:45.609> so

00:01:46.169 --> 00:01:46.179 
the head we also machine a speed ring so

00:01:46.179 --> 00:01:49.020 
the head we also machine a speed ring so
speed<00:01:46.539> rings<00:01:46.810> are<00:01:46.960> eliminated<00:01:47.590> now<00:01:48.369> to<00:01:48.850> put

00:01:49.020 --> 00:01:49.030 
speed rings are eliminated now to put

00:01:49.030 --> 00:01:51.510 
speed rings are eliminated now to put
your<00:01:49.240> wheels<00:01:49.509> onto<00:01:50.079> it<00:01:50.289> it's<00:01:51.189> really<00:01:51.399> a

00:01:51.510 --> 00:01:51.520 
your wheels onto it it's really a

00:01:51.520 --> 00:01:54.840 
your wheels onto it it's really a
reverse<00:01:51.999> axle<00:01:52.749> so<00:01:53.289> you<00:01:53.350> place<00:01:53.740> it<00:01:53.950> into<00:01:54.189> there

00:01:54.840 --> 00:01:54.850 
reverse axle so you place it into there

00:01:54.850 --> 00:01:58.679 
reverse axle so you place it into there
and<00:01:55.090> tighten<00:01:55.960> it<00:01:56.020> up<00:01:56.200> here<00:01:57.179> now<00:01:58.179> if<00:01:58.420> you<00:01:58.569> look

00:01:58.679 --> 00:01:58.689 
and tighten it up here now if you look

00:01:58.689 --> 00:02:01.399 
and tighten it up here now if you look
very<00:01:58.990> very<00:01:59.170> carefully<00:01:59.889> you'll<00:02:00.069> see<00:02:00.130> one<00:02:00.639> side

00:02:01.399 --> 00:02:01.409 
very very carefully you'll see one side

00:02:01.409 --> 00:02:05.249 
very very carefully you'll see one side
here<00:02:02.409> is<00:02:02.619> marked<00:02:03.100> with<00:02:03.130> an<00:02:03.310> X<00:02:03.490> now<00:02:04.270> that<00:02:04.600> is<00:02:04.810> to

00:02:05.249 --> 00:02:05.259 
here is marked with an X now that is to

00:02:05.259 --> 00:02:06.719 
here is marked with an X now that is to
tell<00:02:05.499> you<00:02:05.619> which<00:02:05.859> side<00:02:06.159> to<00:02:06.189> put<00:02:06.609> the

00:02:06.719 --> 00:02:06.729 
tell you which side to put the

00:02:06.729 --> 00:02:09.270 
tell you which side to put the
left-handed<00:02:07.539> nut<00:02:07.749> and<00:02:08.110> the<00:02:08.280> left-handed

00:02:09.270 --> 00:02:09.280 
left-handed nut and the left-handed

00:02:09.280 --> 00:02:11.640 
left-handed nut and the left-handed
thread<00:02:09.670> so<00:02:10.539> when<00:02:10.750> these<00:02:10.899> two<00:02:11.230> are<00:02:11.440> put

00:02:11.640 --> 00:02:11.650 
thread so when these two are put

00:02:11.650 --> 00:02:15.080 
thread so when these two are put
together<00:02:11.800> like<00:02:12.550> that<00:02:12.580> you<00:02:13.150> do<00:02:13.330> them<00:02:13.510> up

00:02:15.080 --> 00:02:15.090 
together like that you do them up

00:02:15.090 --> 00:02:18.960 
together like that you do them up
anti-clockwise<00:02:17.520> which<00:02:18.520> takes<00:02:18.790> a<00:02:18.850> little

00:02:18.960 --> 00:02:18.970 
anti-clockwise which takes a little

00:02:18.970 --> 00:02:20.760 
anti-clockwise which takes a little
while<00:02:19.180> to<00:02:19.360> get<00:02:19.480> used<00:02:19.720> to<00:02:19.960> but<00:02:20.410> what<00:02:20.590> that<00:02:20.710> means

00:02:20.760 --> 00:02:20.770 
while to get used to but what that means

00:02:20.770 --> 00:02:22.750 
while to get used to but what that means
is<00:02:21.220> as<00:02:21.460> the<00:02:21.880> truck

00:02:22.750 --> 00:02:22.760 
is as the truck

00:02:22.760 --> 00:02:25.899 
is as the truck
truck<00:02:23.090> is<00:02:23.239> rolling<00:02:23.599> along<00:02:24.129> it<00:02:25.129> will<00:02:25.670> always
