Bar<00:00:19.230> in<00:00:19.560> the<00:00:19.800> Philippines<00:00:20.310> and<00:00:20.580> I<00:00:20.820> kind<00:00:21.060> of

00:00:21.080 --> 00:00:21.090 
Bar in the Philippines and I kind of

00:00:21.090 --> 00:00:22.970 
Bar in the Philippines and I kind of
just<00:00:21.240> checked<00:00:21.480> online<00:00:21.689> and<00:00:22.260> I<00:00:22.410> think<00:00:22.710> that<00:00:22.859> the

00:00:22.970 --> 00:00:22.980 
just checked online and I think that the

00:00:22.980 --> 00:00:26.060 
just checked online and I think that the
reason<00:00:23.130> why<00:00:23.340> it<00:00:23.519> was<00:00:24.119> on<00:00:24.420> sale<00:00:24.810> is<00:00:25.230> because

00:00:26.060 --> 00:00:26.070 
reason why it was on sale is because

00:00:26.070 --> 00:00:28.939 
reason why it was on sale is because
it's<00:00:26.250> been<00:00:26.430> reformulated<00:00:26.939> and<00:00:27.599> it<00:00:28.560> no<00:00:28.800> longer

00:00:28.939 --> 00:00:28.949 
it's been reformulated and it no longer

00:00:28.949 --> 00:00:32.150 
it's been reformulated and it no longer
comes<00:00:29.340> in<00:00:29.760> this<00:00:30.029> frosted<00:00:30.779> glass<00:00:31.230> and<00:00:31.619> the

00:00:32.150 --> 00:00:32.160 
comes in this frosted glass and the

00:00:32.160 --> 00:00:34.520 
comes in this frosted glass and the
color<00:00:32.520> selection<00:00:32.969> seems<00:00:33.390> to<00:00:33.630> have<00:00:33.719> changed<00:00:33.780> so

00:00:34.520 --> 00:00:34.530 
color selection seems to have changed so

00:00:34.530 --> 00:00:36.319 
color selection seems to have changed so
I<00:00:34.620> was<00:00:34.860> thinking<00:00:35.190> of<00:00:35.340> not<00:00:35.610> putting<00:00:35.850> the<00:00:36.120> serve

00:00:36.319 --> 00:00:36.329 
I was thinking of not putting the serve

00:00:36.329 --> 00:00:38.780 
I was thinking of not putting the serve
you<00:00:36.540> up<00:00:36.690> anymore<00:00:36.989> but<00:00:37.410> I<00:00:37.440> figured<00:00:37.920> it<00:00:38.250> would<00:00:38.520> be

00:00:38.780 --> 00:00:38.790 
you up anymore but I figured it would be

00:00:38.790 --> 00:00:41.270 
you up anymore but I figured it would be
useful<00:00:39.450> for<00:00:39.629> people<00:00:39.809> who<00:00:40.110> wanna<00:00:40.350> run<00:00:40.890> out<00:00:41.070> and

00:00:41.270 --> 00:00:41.280 
useful for people who wanna run out and

00:00:41.280 --> 00:00:45.110 
useful for people who wanna run out and
grab<00:00:41.550> those<00:00:42.000> last<00:00:42.329> few<00:00:42.629> bottles<00:00:43.170> the<00:00:44.120> original

00:00:45.110 --> 00:00:45.120 
grab those last few bottles the original

00:00:45.120 --> 00:00:46.819 
grab those last few bottles the original
formulation<00:00:45.539> garnered<00:00:46.200> a<00:00:46.379> lot<00:00:46.410> of<00:00:46.649> good

00:00:46.819 --> 00:00:46.829 
formulation garnered a lot of good

00:00:46.829 --> 00:00:48.380 
formulation garnered a lot of good
reviews<00:00:46.980> so<00:00:47.219> I<00:00:47.399> don't<00:00:47.640> know<00:00:47.789> why<00:00:48.000> they've

00:00:48.380 --> 00:00:48.390 
reviews so I don't know why they've

00:00:48.390 --> 00:00:50.869 
reviews so I don't know why they've
reformulated<00:00:48.899> maybe<00:00:49.440> the<00:00:49.710> new<00:00:50.219> formula<00:00:50.700> is

00:00:50.869 --> 00:00:50.879 
reformulated maybe the new formula is

00:00:50.879 --> 00:00:52.790 
reformulated maybe the new formula is
even<00:00:51.750> better<00:00:51.870> than<00:00:52.050> this<00:00:52.260> one<00:00:52.440> which<00:00:52.590> is

00:00:52.790 --> 00:00:52.800 
even better than this one which is

00:00:52.800 --> 00:00:55.549 
even better than this one which is
fantastic<00:00:53.190> by<00:00:53.760> the<00:00:53.789> way<00:00:53.969> so<00:00:54.539> we're<00:00:55.050> gonna<00:00:55.199> cut

00:00:55.549 --> 00:00:55.559 
fantastic by the way so we're gonna cut

00:00:55.559 --> 00:00:58.819 
fantastic by the way so we're gonna cut

coverage foundation it's almost like a

00:01:19.640 --> 00:01:22.640 
coverage foundation it's almost like a
tinted<00:01:20.640> moisturizer<00:01:20.909> but<00:01:21.689> you<00:01:21.869> can<00:01:22.170> build<00:01:22.530> it

00:01:22.640 --> 00:01:22.650 
tinted moisturizer but you can build it

00:01:22.650 --> 00:01:25.969 
tinted moisturizer but you can build it
up<00:01:22.770> a<00:01:22.920> little<00:01:23.250> bit<00:01:23.520> in<00:01:23.759> some<00:01:24.240> areas<00:01:24.869> it<00:01:25.290> also

00:01:28.460 --> 00:01:28.470 
has an SPF of 15 which is kind of nice

00:01:28.470 --> 00:01:30.499 
has an SPF of 15 which is kind of nice
even<00:01:28.920> less<00:01:29.100> than<00:01:29.310> the<00:01:29.490> Laura<00:01:29.759> Mercier<00:01:30.210> tinted

00:01:30.499 --> 00:01:30.509 
even less than the Laura Mercier tinted

00:01:30.509 --> 00:01:33.080 
even less than the Laura Mercier tinted
moisturizer<00:01:31.110> though<00:01:31.409> so<00:01:31.979> it's<00:01:32.310> very<00:01:32.700> low<00:01:33.060> and

00:01:33.080 --> 00:01:33.090

00:01:33.090 --> 00:01:35.330 
moisturizer though so it's very low and
I<00:01:33.509> wouldn't<00:01:33.810> really<00:01:34.020> like<00:01:34.290> trust<00:01:35.070> this<00:01:35.280> to

00:01:35.330 --> 00:01:35.340 
I wouldn't really like trust this to

00:01:35.340 --> 00:01:38.330 
I wouldn't really like trust this to
keep<00:01:35.939> my<00:01:36.119> face<00:01:36.360> protected<00:01:37.320> from<00:01:37.439> the<00:01:37.590> Sun<00:01:37.799> for

00:01:40.819 --> 00:01:40.829 
like an entire day not at all actually

00:01:40.829 --> 00:01:42.590 
like an entire day not at all actually
maybe<00:01:41.159> 30<00:01:41.490> minutes<00:01:41.670> out<00:01:41.970> in<00:01:42.119> the<00:01:42.270> Sun<00:01:42.420> and

00:01:42.590 --> 00:01:42.600 
maybe 30 minutes out in the Sun and

00:01:42.600 --> 00:01:45.440 
maybe 30 minutes out in the Sun and
that's<00:01:42.659> all<00:01:42.869> you've<00:01:43.110> got<00:01:43.140> with<00:01:43.619> this<00:01:43.799> so<00:01:44.450> the

00:01:45.440 --> 00:01:45.450 
that's all you've got with this so the

00:01:45.450 --> 00:01:47.389 
that's all you've got with this so the
texture<00:01:45.810> of<00:01:45.899> this<00:01:46.140> is<00:01:46.200> fantastic<00:01:46.799> it's

00:01:47.389 --> 00:01:47.399 
texture of this is fantastic it's

00:01:47.399 --> 00:01:51.200 
texture of this is fantastic it's
beautiful<00:01:48.360> it's<00:01:49.009> really<00:01:50.009> smooth<00:01:50.490> going<00:01:50.850> into

00:01:51.200 --> 00:01:51.210 
beautiful it's really smooth going into

00:01:51.210 --> 00:01:53.270 
beautiful it's really smooth going into
the<00:01:51.329> skin<00:01:51.630> I<00:01:51.810> use<00:01:52.320> my<00:01:52.470> fingers<00:01:52.799> to<00:01:52.979> apply<00:01:53.009> it

00:01:53.270 --> 00:01:53.280 
the skin I use my fingers to apply it

00:01:53.280 --> 00:01:55.280 
the skin I use my fingers to apply it
because<00:01:53.460> I<00:01:53.670> feel<00:01:53.909> like<00:01:53.939> it<00:01:54.509> would<00:01:55.020> just<00:01:55.200> be

00:01:55.280 --> 00:01:55.290 
because I feel like it would just be

00:01:55.290 --> 00:01:57.499 
because I feel like it would just be
lost<00:01:55.530> in<00:01:55.829> a<00:01:55.920> rush<00:01:56.189> and<00:01:56.430> that<00:01:56.579> would<00:01:56.700> be<00:01:56.880> kind<00:01:57.390> of

00:01:57.499 --> 00:01:57.509 
lost in a rush and that would be kind of

00:01:57.509 --> 00:01:59.090 
lost in a rush and that would be kind of
useless<00:01:57.689> so<00:01:57.990> I<00:01:58.020> really<00:01:58.409> break<00:01:58.530> it<00:01:58.710> in<00:01:58.890> with<00:01:59.009> my

00:02:11.670 --> 00:02:11.680 
it doesn't give full coverage so

absolutely nothing on the skin which is

00:02:51.310 --> 00:02:53.220 
absolutely nothing on the skin which is
probably<00:02:51.669> one<00:02:51.819> of<00:02:51.849> the<00:02:52.000> main<00:02:52.150> reasons<00:02:52.510> that<00:02:52.659> I

00:02:53.220 --> 00:02:53.230 
probably one of the main reasons that I

00:02:53.230 --> 00:02:55.890 
probably one of the main reasons that I
like<00:02:53.620> it<00:02:53.799> so<00:02:54.010> much<00:02:54.040> the<00:02:54.760> price<00:02:55.030> tag<00:02:55.359> for<00:02:55.389> this

00:02:55.890 --> 00:02:55.900 
like it so much the price tag for this

00:02:55.900 --> 00:03:00.780 
like it so much the price tag for this
is<00:02:56.189> to<00:02:57.189> 750<00:02:57.939> at<00:02:58.120> full<00:02:58.419> price<00:02:58.780> it's<00:02:59.650> so<00:03:00.609> that's

00:03:00.780 --> 00:03:00.790 
is to 750 at full price it's so that's

00:03:00.790 --> 00:03:04.080 
is to 750 at full price it's so that's
about<00:03:01.109> 62<00:03:02.109> dollars<00:03:02.650> and<00:03:03.280> then<00:03:03.370> add<00:03:03.579> on<00:03:03.790> a<00:03:03.819> bit

00:03:04.080 --> 00:03:04.090 
about 62 dollars and then add on a bit

00:03:04.090 --> 00:03:08.580

for when they ship it over here and add

00:03:08.590 --> 00:03:11.670 
for when they ship it over here and add
a<00:03:08.620> bit<00:03:08.859> of<00:03:08.919> price<00:03:09.280> on<00:03:09.459> so<00:03:10.150> it<00:03:10.719> is<00:03:10.900> not<00:03:11.349> a<00:03:11.379> cheap

00:03:11.670 --> 00:03:11.680 
a bit of price on so it is not a cheap

00:03:11.680 --> 00:03:15.780

what<00:04:29.090> I<00:04:29.120> think<00:04:29.450> again<00:04:29.750> they've<00:04:30.050> improved<00:04:30.440> on

00:04:30.820 --> 00:04:30.830 
what I think again they've improved on

00:04:30.830 --> 00:04:33.310 
what I think again they've improved on
the<00:04:31.430> co<00:04:31.550> selection<00:04:32.030> for<00:04:32.240> this<00:04:32.389> old<00:04:32.660> formula

00:04:33.310 --> 00:04:33.320 
the co selection for this old formula

00:04:33.320 --> 00:04:37.150 
the co selection for this old formula
was<00:04:33.470> not<00:04:33.650> that<00:04:33.889> great<00:04:34.130> this<00:04:34.430> is<00:04:34.700> the<00:04:36.010> darkest<00:04:37.010> I

00:04:37.150 --> 00:04:37.160 
was not that great this is the darkest I

00:04:37.160 --> 00:04:39.909

believe<00:04:37.520> OC<00:04:38.480> 3<00:04:38.750> or<00:04:38.930> there<00:04:39.260> is<00:04:39.380> one<00:04:39.560> that<00:04:39.710> it's<00:04:39.830> a

00:04:39.909 --> 00:04:39.919 
believe OC 3 or there is one that it's a

00:04:39.919 --> 00:04:41.409 
believe OC 3 or there is one that it's a
bit<00:04:40.100> darker<00:04:40.430> but<00:04:40.580> it's<00:04:40.790> more<00:04:41.090> of<00:04:41.150> a<00:04:41.210> cool
