00:00:00.110 --> 00:00:04.110
 for me one of the important aspects before 

00:00:03.060 --> 00:00:06.540
 getting started 

00:00:04.110 --> 00:00:07.230
 it is to prepare anything 

00:00:06.540 --> 00:00:09.750
 to use 

00:00:07.230 --> 00:00:12.630
 In this case, there are pencils 

00:00:09.750 --> 00:00:15.509
 some features I recommend the night 

00:00:12.630 --> 00:00:18.300
 still sharpen pencils clerical 

00:00:15.509 --> 00:00:21.720
 a knife and there are two reasons 

00:00:18.300 --> 00:00:23.910
 first if i sharpen with a knife fail 

00:00:21.720 --> 00:00:25.890
 achieve more big workers 

00:00:23.910 --> 00:00:29.070
 surface these sins on how much I have 

00:00:25.890 --> 00:00:32.189
 We see you next time for mascara 

00:00:29.070 --> 00:00:34.739
 sometimes you want a vulture pencil 

00:00:32.189 --> 00:00:37.350
 on one side only then square 

00:00:34.739 --> 00:00:39.930
 to which we will shade it 

00:00:37.350 --> 00:00:42.559
 considers the work to the floor by example again 

00:00:39.930 --> 00:00:46.230
 there will be more tasks too 

00:00:42.559 --> 00:00:48.450
 many are skeptical that 

00:00:46.230 --> 00:00:51.329
 first he has to learn to sharpen 

00:00:48.450 --> 00:00:54.719
 pencils output strumming complicated no i 

00:00:51.329 --> 00:00:56.670
 don't ask immediately to be carried to this 

00:00:54.719 --> 00:00:58.620
 seriously at least learn and maybe 

00:00:56.670 --> 00:01:01.649
 further to be works when the memory is what 

00:00:58.620 --> 00:01:03.539
 so good work is more convenient than the topic 

00:01:01.649 --> 00:01:03.930
 which is sharpened on an ordinary such disk and 

00:01:03.539 --> 00:01:06.750
 cottages 

00:01:03.930 --> 00:01:10.010
 I'm going to sharpen the pencil 

00:01:06.750 --> 00:01:10.010
 see how to do it better 

00:01:12.680 --> 00:01:19.710
 notice that i click big 

00:01:16.950 --> 00:01:21.750
 finger of the left hand thereby fails 

00:01:19.710 --> 00:01:26.840
 adjust the pressure 

00:01:21.750 --> 00:01:29.610
 more clearly that sometimes Iâ€™m doing so yes 

00:01:26.840 --> 00:01:32.520
 it may cause us to be too 

00:01:29.610 --> 00:01:34.829
 this ska press it with the fretboard also the angle 

00:01:32.520 --> 00:01:39.000
 tilt the blade relative to the hoist to 

00:01:34.829 --> 00:01:43.229
 Natasha should not be very much after 

00:01:39.000 --> 00:01:44.700
 As I cleaned the slate need to sharpen 

00:01:43.229 --> 00:01:47.130
 doing so 

00:01:44.700 --> 00:01:50.030
 put it so vertically and click 

00:01:47.130 --> 00:01:58.890
 already index finger on the blade 

00:01:50.030 --> 00:02:03.289
 evenly sharpen father seal possible 

00:01:58.890 --> 00:02:03.289
 do only when we have a sharp knife 

00:02:05.509 --> 00:02:11.970
 It turns out somewhere such a pencil 

00:02:09.170 --> 00:02:14.640
 work everything is ready we have 100 

00:02:11.970 --> 00:02:19.640
 pencil eraser now choose now 

00:02:14.640 --> 00:02:19.640
 example we will draw and set about
