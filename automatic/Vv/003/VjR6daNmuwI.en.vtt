00:00:18.080 --> 00:00:18.090 
to it you're going to need a root File

00:00:18.090 --> 00:00:20.420 
to it you're going to need a root File
Explorer<00:00:18.570> I'm<00:00:18.840> using<00:00:19.080> ES<00:00:19.529> File<00:00:19.770> Explorer<00:00:20.220> and

00:00:20.420 --> 00:00:20.430

00:00:22.220 --> 00:00:22.230 
firstly let's make sure the system is

00:00:22.230 --> 00:00:23.810 
firstly let's make sure the system is
mounted<00:00:22.380> as<00:00:22.740> read<00:00:22.949> and<00:00:23.130> write<00:00:23.250> otherwise<00:00:23.640> we

00:00:23.810 --> 00:00:23.820 
mounted as read and write otherwise we

00:00:23.820 --> 00:00:25.429 
mounted as read and write otherwise we
can't<00:00:24.029> actually<00:00:24.210> edit<00:00:24.420> anything<00:00:24.869> so<00:00:25.199> click

00:00:25.429 --> 00:00:25.439 
can't actually edit anything so click

00:00:25.439 --> 00:00:27.230 
can't actually edit anything so click
mount<00:00:25.740> read<00:00:25.920> write<00:00:26.160> change<00:00:26.730> both<00:00:26.939> of<00:00:26.970> these<00:00:27.150> to

00:00:27.230 --> 00:00:27.240 
mount read write change both of these to

00:00:27.240 --> 00:00:29.390 
mount read write change both of these to
our<00:00:27.539> W<00:00:27.960> press<00:00:28.289> ok<00:00:28.590> and<00:00:28.830> you're<00:00:28.920> ready<00:00:29.070> to<00:00:29.130> go

by default and we're going to be

00:01:24.570 --> 00:01:27.050 
by default and we're going to be
changing<00:01:24.990> these<00:01:25.110> to<00:01:25.409> 20<00:01:25.890> if<00:01:26.100> you're<00:01:26.700> wondering

00:01:27.050 --> 00:01:27.060 
changing these to 20 if you're wondering

00:01:27.060 --> 00:01:28.460 
changing these to 20 if you're wondering
where<00:01:27.210> I<00:01:27.240> got<00:01:27.299> these<00:01:27.570> values<00:01:27.960> from<00:01:28.140> it<00:01:28.320> was

00:01:28.460 --> 00:01:28.470 
where I got these values from it was

00:01:28.470 --> 00:01:30.140 
where I got these values from it was
from<00:01:28.710> an<00:01:28.799> ex-dea<00:01:29.189> thread<00:01:29.610> there's<00:01:29.850> loads<00:01:30.060> of

00:01:30.140 --> 00:01:30.150 
from an ex-dea thread there's loads of

00:01:30.150 --> 00:01:31.819 
from an ex-dea thread there's loads of
people<00:01:30.270> using<00:01:30.689> the<00:01:30.780> same<00:01:31.049> value<00:01:31.409> so<00:01:31.590> I<00:01:31.619> thought

00:01:31.819 --> 00:01:31.829 
people using the same value so I thought

00:01:31.829 --> 00:01:33.530 
people using the same value so I thought
I<00:01:31.860> might<00:01:32.070> as<00:01:32.130> well<00:01:32.250> use<00:01:32.520> the<00:01:32.670> same<00:01:32.909> there<00:01:33.420> is

00:01:33.530 --> 00:01:33.540 
I might as well use the same there is

00:01:33.540 --> 00:01:35.120 
I might as well use the same there is
also<00:01:33.689> a<00:01:33.810> flashable<00:01:34.380> zip<00:01:34.409> if<00:01:34.740> you<00:01:34.829> don't<00:01:35.009> want

00:01:35.120 --> 00:01:35.130 
also a flashable zip if you don't want

00:01:35.130 --> 00:01:36.800 
also a flashable zip if you don't want
to<00:01:35.220> do<00:01:35.280> this<00:01:35.460> manually<00:01:35.790> but<00:01:36.119> in<00:01:36.329> all<00:01:36.450> honestly

00:01:36.800 --> 00:01:36.810 
to do this manually but in all honestly

00:01:36.810 --> 00:01:38.270 
to do this manually but in all honestly
I<00:01:36.869> thought<00:01:37.170> manually<00:01:37.590> was<00:01:37.740> easier<00:01:38.100> you<00:01:38.250> don't

00:01:38.270 --> 00:01:38.280 
I thought manually was easier you don't

00:01:38.280 --> 00:01:39.800 
I thought manually was easier you don't
have<00:01:38.549> to<00:01:38.670> download<00:01:38.850> any<00:01:39.210> files<00:01:39.509> you<00:01:39.659> don't

00:01:39.800 --> 00:01:39.810 
have to download any files you don't

00:01:39.810 --> 00:01:41.690 
have to download any files you don't
have<00:01:39.990> to<00:01:40.079> go<00:01:40.200> into<00:01:40.320> recovery<00:01:40.680> make<00:01:41.400> sure<00:01:41.549> you

00:01:41.690 --> 00:01:41.700 
have to go into recovery make sure you

00:01:41.700 --> 00:01:43.310 
have to go into recovery make sure you
hit<00:01:41.850> back<00:01:42.090> and<00:01:42.299> hit<00:01:42.420> save<00:01:42.720> and<00:01:43.020> then<00:01:43.140> just

00:01:43.310 --> 00:01:43.320 
hit back and hit save and then just

00:01:43.320 --> 00:01:44.719 
hit back and hit save and then just
reboot<00:01:43.680> your<00:01:43.770> device<00:01:43.829> for<00:01:44.310> this<00:01:44.430> to<00:01:44.579> take

00:01:44.719 --> 00:01:44.729
