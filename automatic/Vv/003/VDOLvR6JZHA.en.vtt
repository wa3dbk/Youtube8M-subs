00:00:00.290 --> 00:00:04.740
 nada together here is save and again 

00:00:03.300 --> 00:00:07.290
 Today I 'm in for you again 

00:00:04.740 --> 00:00:08.610
 world of warcraft on the way or one 

00:00:07.290 --> 00:00:11.700
 I'm here to be a bit more specific 

00:00:08.610 --> 00:00:13.290
 already in world of trainer and yes here 

00:00:11.700 --> 00:00:15.210
 I want to show you today 

00:00:13.290 --> 00:00:17.730
 It could have a chic engine 

00:00:15.210 --> 00:00:19.859
 is even disadvantages of which 

00:00:17.730 --> 00:00:21.240
 with these yes I would like to say 

00:00:19.859 --> 00:00:22.369
 boss is actually can want what 

00:00:21.240 --> 00:00:25.019
 I just call it that way 

00:00:22.369 --> 00:00:27.930
 dripping and although this boss is called 

00:00:25.019 --> 00:00:28.920
 carouge and yes you see it already has 

00:00:27.930 --> 00:00:30.929
 Do not really think that much 

00:00:28.920 --> 00:00:34.230
 many skills but he offers 

00:00:30.929 --> 00:00:36.180
 just those who have the aco and 

00:00:34.230 --> 00:00:38.100
 not with less so if you are here 

00:00:36.180 --> 00:00:40.500
 as a normal player , I would go there 

00:00:38.100 --> 00:00:42.989
 with 700,000 one speaks that a bed 

00:00:40.500 --> 00:00:44.820
 and a tank with cds just survives 

00:00:42.989 --> 00:00:45.840
 a hit so that is not synonymous 

00:00:44.820 --> 00:00:47.489
 really conceivable 

00:00:45.840 --> 00:00:50.219
 then you just have to go there a bit 

00:00:47.489 --> 00:00:51.480
 and scoff cold when you lay down 

00:00:50.219 --> 00:00:54.030
 You see, here's the mount 

00:00:51.480 --> 00:00:56.160
 printed and yes one of the players the 

00:00:54.030 --> 00:00:57.629
 have him put it then show it 

00:00:56.160 --> 00:01:00.120
 I again where you find that and indeed 

00:00:57.629 --> 00:01:04.049
 in almost full degree at the top 

00:01:00.120 --> 00:01:05.309
 and yes I had multiplied then 

00:01:04.049 --> 00:01:07.200
 then try luck that I have 

00:01:05.309 --> 00:01:09.090
 laid the day and then finally 

00:01:07.200 --> 00:01:11.250
 got it here and I would say 

00:01:09.090 --> 00:01:14.689
 Let's take a look at that 

00:01:11.250 --> 00:01:17.040
 information on the edge that is by the way 

00:01:14.689 --> 00:01:18.960
 tradable and you can do it also in the 

00:01:17.040 --> 00:01:22.530
 auction house say if you 

00:01:18.960 --> 00:01:24.930
 luck has continued dicing here 

00:01:22.530 --> 00:01:26.580
 you then you can all also 

00:01:24.930 --> 00:01:29.100
 I had tried that first 

00:01:26.580 --> 00:01:31.140
 to beat some coal out but yes 

00:01:29.100 --> 00:01:32.250
 there is still a percent drop and 

00:01:31.140 --> 00:01:33.720
 then people already have several people on it 

00:01:32.250 --> 00:01:35.729
 that's pretty good 

00:01:33.720 --> 00:01:37.530
 it is not possible anymore to drive 

00:01:35.729 --> 00:01:39.780
 worth as much as I might think so 

00:01:37.530 --> 00:01:41.670
 he had wanted yes he sees this is here 

00:01:39.780 --> 00:01:43.079
 It is quite a nice wolf for the people 

00:01:41.670 --> 00:01:44.549
 who can drive the mount 

00:01:43.079 --> 00:01:45.750
 or want that is 

00:01:44.549 --> 00:01:48.119
 actually not particularly difficult to 

00:01:45.750 --> 00:01:50.100
 is looking for a group about this in 

00:01:48.119 --> 00:01:51.869
 quotes new groups seeking to do 

00:01:50.100 --> 00:01:53.880
 and there you are actually relative 

00:01:51.869 --> 00:01:54.810
 quickly find and can then get in 

00:01:53.880 --> 00:01:56.700
 group together 

00:01:54.810 --> 00:02:00.210
 yes and then I wish you much fun 

00:01:56.700 --> 00:02:01.350
 when driving and ghana was looking forward to it 

00:02:00.210 --> 00:02:03.299
 that i will watch my videos again 

00:02:01.350 --> 00:02:05.420
 looked mozilla until the next 

00:02:03.299 --> 00:02:05.420
 times
