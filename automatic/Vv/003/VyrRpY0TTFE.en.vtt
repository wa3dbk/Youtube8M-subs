00:05:16.490 --> 00:05:16.500 
there was such an expectation is is

00:05:16.500 --> 00:05:20.450 
there was such an expectation is is
downward<00:05:17.220> okay<00:05:17.639> so<00:05:18.240> I<00:05:18.720> think<00:05:19.110> that<00:05:19.460> probably

00:05:20.450 --> 00:05:20.460 
downward okay so I think that probably

00:05:20.460 --> 00:05:22.420 
downward okay so I think that probably
around<00:05:20.910> you<00:05:21.479> know<00:05:21.630> it's<00:05:21.780> going<00:05:21.900> to<00:05:21.960> take<00:05:22.199> a

00:05:22.420 --> 00:05:22.430 
around you know it's going to take a

00:05:22.430 --> 00:05:24.800 
around you know it's going to take a
month<00:05:23.430> or<00:05:23.580> two<00:05:23.610> probably<00:05:23.940> to<00:05:24.180> get<00:05:24.360> there<00:05:24.600> but<00:05:24.750> I

00:05:24.800 --> 00:05:24.810 
month or two probably to get there but I

00:05:24.810 --> 00:05:26.360 
month or two probably to get there but I
think<00:05:25.020> you<00:05:25.169> are<00:05:25.350> going<00:05:25.560> to<00:05:25.620> see<00:05:25.770> a<00:05:25.800> continued

00:05:26.360 --> 00:05:26.370 
think you are going to see a continued

00:05:26.370 --> 00:05:28.400 
think you are going to see a continued
of<00:05:26.520> a<00:05:26.610> bottoming<00:05:27.030> out<00:05:27.180> in<00:05:27.240> the<00:05:27.690> metals<00:05:27.990> market

00:05:28.400 --> 00:05:28.410 
of a bottoming out in the metals market

00:05:28.410 --> 00:05:31.040 
of a bottoming out in the metals market
and<00:05:29.340> this<00:05:29.490> is<00:05:29.669> very<00:05:29.880> short<00:05:30.210> term<00:05:30.450> it's<00:05:30.720> a<00:05:30.780> very

00:05:31.040 --> 00:05:31.050 
and this is very short term it's a very

00:05:31.050 --> 00:05:33.379 
and this is very short term it's a very
unique<00:05:31.380> opportunity<00:05:32.100> because<00:05:32.280> if<00:05:32.700> you<00:05:33.180> look

00:05:33.379 --> 00:05:33.389 
unique opportunity because if you look

00:05:33.389 --> 00:05:35.330 
unique opportunity because if you look
at<00:05:33.570> what<00:05:33.720> they're<00:05:33.870> doing<00:05:34.289> nothing<00:05:35.190> has

00:05:35.330 --> 00:05:35.340 
at what they're doing nothing has

00:05:35.340 --> 00:05:37.790 
at what they're doing nothing has
changed<00:05:35.820> they<00:05:36.240> haven't<00:05:36.539> fixed<00:05:36.990> one<00:05:37.650> problem

00:05:37.790 --> 00:05:37.800 
changed they haven't fixed one problem

00:05:37.800 --> 00:05:41.150 
changed they haven't fixed one problem
okay<00:05:38.729> not<00:05:39.060> one<00:05:39.479> problems<00:05:40.380> being<00:05:40.590> fixed<00:05:41.039> and

00:05:41.150 --> 00:05:41.160 
okay not one problems being fixed and

00:05:41.160 --> 00:05:42.710 
okay not one problems being fixed and
then<00:05:41.400> look<00:05:41.639> in<00:05:41.760> the<00:05:41.880> United<00:05:42.240> States<00:05:42.300> the

00:05:42.710 --> 00:05:42.720 
then look in the United States the

00:05:42.720 --> 00:05:45.170 
then look in the United States the
threat<00:05:43.110> of<00:05:43.289> a<00:05:43.500> sequester<00:05:44.099> to<00:05:44.310> have<00:05:44.520> automatic

00:05:45.170 --> 00:05:45.180 
threat of a sequester to have automatic

00:05:45.180 --> 00:05:47.779 
threat of a sequester to have automatic
cuts<00:05:45.419> man<00:05:45.710> menos<00:05:46.710> Congress<00:05:47.250> people<00:05:47.400> are

00:05:56.099 --> 00:05:57.830 
fifth inning so they're already trying
to<00:05:56.220> figure<00:05:56.520> out<00:05:56.550> a<00:05:56.669> way<00:05:56.940> to<00:05:57.000> circumvent<00:05:57.389> the

00:05:57.830 --> 00:05:57.840 
to figure out a way to circumvent the

00:05:57.840 --> 00:05:59.270 
to figure out a way to circumvent the
law<00:05:57.870> so<00:05:58.200> they<00:05:58.229> don't<00:05:58.530> have<00:05:58.740> to<00:05:58.800> cut<00:05:59.130> spending

00:05:59.270 --> 00:05:59.280

00:06:12.409 --> 00:06:12.419 
in the losses and then we'll figure out

00:06:12.419 --> 00:06:14.300 
in the losses and then we'll figure out
ten<00:06:12.810> years<00:06:13.020> later<00:06:13.229> how<00:06:13.500> to<00:06:13.560> fix<00:06:13.830> the<00:06:13.950> problem

okay as long as these governments
operate<00:06:18.000> in<00:06:18.630> this<00:06:18.810> manner<00:06:19.169> you're<00:06:19.889> going<00:06:20.039> to

00:06:20.120 --> 00:06:20.130 
operate in this manner you're going to

00:06:20.130 --> 00:06:22.430 
operate in this manner you're going to
always<00:06:20.610> have<00:06:20.849> a<00:06:20.880> bull<00:06:21.180> market<00:06:21.419> in<00:06:21.660> commodities

00:06:25.460 --> 00:06:25.470 
because it's automatic inflationary it's

00:06:25.470 --> 00:06:27.529 
because it's automatic inflationary it's
only<00:06:25.830> a<00:06:25.950> matter<00:06:26.160> of<00:06:26.340> time<00:06:26.460> before<00:06:26.880> the<00:06:27.270> Fed<00:06:27.510> is

00:06:27.529 --> 00:06:27.539 
only a matter of time before the Fed is

00:06:27.539 --> 00:06:29.390 
only a matter of time before the Fed is
going<00:06:27.870> to<00:06:27.930> be<00:06:28.020> forced<00:06:28.620> to<00:06:28.800> do<00:06:28.919> an<00:06:29.039> asset
