off<00:04:55.630> at<00:04:55.840> these<00:04:56.020> zealots<00:04:56.230> try<00:04:56.470> to<00:04:56.530> hold<00:04:56.680> around

00:04:56.790 --> 00:04:56.800 
off at these zealots try to hold around

00:04:56.800 --> 00:04:58.530 
off at these zealots try to hold around
try<00:04:57.040> to<00:04:57.100> make<00:04:57.220> sure<00:04:57.370> is<00:04:57.430> also<00:04:58.120> get<00:04:58.300> picked<00:04:58.450> off

00:04:58.530 --> 00:04:58.540 
try to make sure is also get picked off

00:04:58.540 --> 00:04:59.760 
try to make sure is also get picked off
each<00:04:58.690> player<00:04:58.870> whose<00:04:59.050> is<00:04:59.200> all<00:04:59.320> but<00:04:59.470> soon<00:04:59.620> and

00:04:59.760 --> 00:04:59.770 
each player whose is all but soon and

00:04:59.770 --> 00:05:02.670 
each player whose is all but soon and
Jamie<00:05:00.010> gets<00:05:00.730> his<00:05:00.850> third<00:05:01.000> goon<00:05:01.480> out<00:05:01.690> there<00:05:02.020> is

00:05:02.670 --> 00:05:02.680 
Jamie gets his third goon out there is

00:05:02.680 --> 00:05:04.080 
Jamie gets his third goon out there is
gonna<00:05:02.980> force<00:05:03.280> that<00:05:03.400> back<00:05:03.580> getting<00:05:03.910> his<00:05:04.030> own

00:05:04.080 --> 00:05:04.090 
gonna force that back getting his own

00:05:04.090 --> 00:05:08.010 
gonna force that back getting his own
some<00:05:04.330> robotics<00:05:05.110> easily<00:05:05.350> out<00:05:05.470> there<00:05:06.780> so<00:05:07.780> the

00:05:08.010 --> 00:05:08.020 
some robotics easily out there so the

00:05:08.020 --> 00:05:10.200 
some robotics easily out there so the
Reavers<00:05:08.290> our<00:05:08.530> Observatory<00:05:09.130> first<00:05:09.730> of<00:05:09.970> course

00:05:10.200 --> 00:05:10.210 
Reavers our Observatory first of course

00:05:10.210 --> 00:05:13.230 
Reavers our Observatory first of course
for<00:05:10.720> stats<00:05:11.020> because<00:05:11.640> he<00:05:12.640> didn't<00:05:12.850> get<00:05:12.940> asked

00:05:13.230 --> 00:05:13.240 
for stats because he didn't get asked

00:05:13.240 --> 00:05:14.850 
for stats because he didn't get asked
out<00:05:13.360> he<00:05:13.660> wants<00:05:13.900> to<00:05:13.960> make<00:05:14.080> sure<00:05:14.140> there's<00:05:14.410> no

00:05:14.850 --> 00:05:14.860 
out he wants to make sure there's no

00:05:14.860 --> 00:05:16.230 
out he wants to make sure there's no
Dark<00:05:15.100> Templar<00:05:15.250> rush<00:05:15.580> is<00:05:15.700> going<00:05:15.850> to<00:05:15.910> be<00:05:15.970> coming

00:05:16.230 --> 00:05:16.240 
Dark Templar rush is going to be coming

00:05:16.240 --> 00:05:17.790 
Dark Templar rush is going to be coming
at<00:05:16.360> him<00:05:16.480> but<00:05:16.660> I<00:05:16.870> think<00:05:17.140> as<00:05:17.260> soon<00:05:17.410> as<00:05:17.530> he<00:05:17.590> looks

00:05:17.790 --> 00:05:17.800 
at him but I think as soon as he looks

00:05:17.800 --> 00:05:19.320 
at him but I think as soon as he looks
as<00:05:18.010> you<00:05:18.130> see<00:05:18.310> is<00:05:18.370> this<00:05:18.520> force<00:05:18.820> of<00:05:18.970> Jamie's

00:05:19.320 --> 00:05:19.330 
as you see is this force of Jamie's

00:05:19.330 --> 00:05:20.430 
as you see is this force of Jamie's
that's<00:05:19.540> probably<00:05:19.810> not<00:05:19.900> what<00:05:19.960> is<00:05:20.170> going<00:05:20.320> to<00:05:20.350> be

00:05:20.430 --> 00:05:20.440 
that's probably not what is going to be

00:05:20.440 --> 00:05:22.140 
that's probably not what is going to be
expecting<00:05:20.920> but<00:05:21.460> still<00:05:21.490> wants<00:05:21.880> to<00:05:21.970> make<00:05:22.120> sure

00:05:22.140 --> 00:05:22.150 
expecting but still wants to make sure

00:05:22.150 --> 00:05:23.370 
expecting but still wants to make sure
you<00:05:22.330> get<00:05:22.450> the<00:05:22.630> scout<00:05:22.870> and<00:05:22.990> there<00:05:23.110> to<00:05:23.200> make<00:05:23.230> sure

00:05:23.370 --> 00:05:23.380 
you get the scout and there to make sure

00:05:23.380 --> 00:05:25.350 
you get the scout and there to make sure
he<00:05:24.280> has<00:05:24.430> a<00:05:24.460> proper<00:05:24.670> information<00:05:24.850> which<00:05:25.180> is<00:05:25.210> at

00:05:25.350 --> 00:05:25.360 
he has a proper information which is at

00:05:25.360 --> 00:05:26.670 
he has a proper information which is at
Jamie's<00:05:25.750> action<00:05:25.930> moving<00:05:26.080> a<00:05:26.170> little<00:05:26.320> bit<00:05:26.440> but<00:05:26.620> I

00:05:26.670 --> 00:05:26.680 
Jamie's action moving a little bit but I

00:05:26.680 --> 00:05:28.110 
Jamie's action moving a little bit but I
think<00:05:26.860> Jamie<00:05:27.070> can<00:05:27.310> afford<00:05:27.610> to<00:05:27.640> simply<00:05:27.910> put

00:05:28.110 --> 00:05:28.120 
think Jamie can afford to simply put

00:05:28.120 --> 00:05:32.130 
think Jamie can afford to simply put
down<00:05:29.880> getting<00:05:30.880> his<00:05:30.970> river<00:05:31.240> earlier<00:05:31.480> doesn't

00:05:32.130 --> 00:05:32.140 
down getting his river earlier doesn't

00:05:32.140 --> 00:05:35.070 
down getting his river earlier doesn't
really<00:05:32.260> need<00:05:32.380> the<00:05:32.470> observers<00:05:33.930> where<00:05:34.930> are<00:05:34.990> we

00:05:35.070 --> 00:05:35.080 
really need the observers where are we

00:05:35.080 --> 00:05:36.870 
really need the observers where are we
getting<00:05:35.230> that<00:05:35.500> support<00:05:35.680> robotic<00:05:36.550> support

00:05:36.870 --> 00:05:36.880 
getting that support robotic support

00:05:36.880 --> 00:05:39.510 
getting that support robotic support
earlier<00:05:37.560> which<00:05:38.560> is<00:05:38.590> I<00:05:38.770> could<00:05:38.920> put<00:05:39.040> the<00:05:39.130> roast

00:05:39.510 --> 00:05:39.520 
earlier which is I could put the roast

00:05:39.520 --> 00:05:42.270 
earlier which is I could put the roast

00:05:47.910 --> 00:05:47.920 
the range kicks in just at that very

the range kicks in just at that very

in the valley of fire robotics facility

00:05:54.520 --> 00:05:57.240 
in the valley of fire robotics facility
is<00:05:55.120> actually<00:05:55.570> the<00:05:55.690> robotics<00:05:56.470> support<00:05:56.950> is

00:05:57.240 --> 00:05:57.250 
is actually the robotics support is

00:05:57.250 --> 00:05:59.670 
is actually the robotics support is
actually<00:05:57.640> the<00:05:57.760> Robo<00:05:58.090> partner<00:05:58.690> on<00:05:58.810> me<00:05:59.020> robotics

actually the Robo partner on me robotics

00:05:59.680 --> 00:06:02.730 
actually the Robo partner on me robotics
facility<00:05:59.830> is<00:06:00.340> just<00:06:00.610> the<00:06:00.820> robot<00:06:01.120> or<00:06:02.020> what<00:06:02.470> is<00:06:02.590> it

00:06:02.730 --> 00:06:02.740 
facility is just the robot or what is it

I<00:06:02.890> forget<00:06:03.610> my<00:06:03.760> star<00:06:04.300> craft<00:06:04.510> flying<00:06:04.660> for<00:06:04.930> a

I forget my star craft flying for a

00:06:06.360 --> 00:06:06.370 
second out J Michigan go fence across

00:06:06.370 --> 00:06:08.670 
second out J Michigan go fence across
the<00:06:06.670> bridge<00:06:06.850> has<00:06:07.000> 17<00:06:07.450> zealot<00:06:07.720> to<00:06:07.840> pop<00:06:08.410> him<00:06:08.560> out

00:06:08.670 --> 00:06:08.680 
the bridge has 17 zealot to pop him out

00:06:08.680 --> 00:06:10.740 
the bridge has 17 zealot to pop him out
but<00:06:08.890> honestly<00:06:09.400> I<00:06:09.520> think<00:06:09.970> a<00:06:10.090> range<00:06:10.330> kicked<00:06:10.630> in

00:06:10.740 --> 00:06:10.750 
but honestly I think a range kicked in

00:06:10.750 --> 00:06:11.790 
but honestly I think a range kicked in
that's<00:06:10.930> why<00:06:11.020> they<00:06:11.140> said<00:06:11.290> to<00:06:11.380> going<00:06:11.590> for<00:06:11.740> this

00:06:11.790 --> 00:06:11.800 
that's why they said to going for this

00:06:11.800 --> 00:06:15.180 
that's why they said to going for this
but<00:06:12.010> stats<00:06:12.220> hold<00:06:12.460> this<00:06:12.550> up<00:06:12.730> fairly<00:06:13.030> well
