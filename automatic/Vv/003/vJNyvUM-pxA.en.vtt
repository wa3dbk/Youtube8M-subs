okay<00:00:09.360> now<00:00:10.139> I've<00:00:10.769> seen<00:00:11.040> the<00:00:11.160> like<00:00:11.309> there's<00:00:11.490> a

00:00:11.570 --> 00:00:11.580 
okay now I've seen the like there's a

00:00:11.580 --> 00:00:13.459 
okay now I've seen the like there's a
lot<00:00:11.670> of<00:00:11.730> electron<00:00:12.240> transport<00:00:12.840> chain<00:00:13.080> videos

on<00:00:13.799> youtube<00:00:14.730> at<00:00:15.330> my<00:00:15.800> level<00:00:16.800> they<00:00:17.789> explained<00:00:18.180> it

00:00:18.290 --> 00:00:18.300 
on youtube at my level they explained it

00:00:18.300 --> 00:00:20.060 
on youtube at my level they explained it
a<00:00:18.390> little<00:00:18.510> different<00:00:18.960> this<00:00:19.170> is<00:00:19.230> not<00:00:19.560> including
