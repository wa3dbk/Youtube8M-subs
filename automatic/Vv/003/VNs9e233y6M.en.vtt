bottom that will get you your dispenser

00:00:12.860 --> 00:00:15.470 
bottom that will get you your dispenser
of<00:00:13.860> course<00:00:14.099> when<00:00:14.309> you<00:00:14.429> place<00:00:14.790> the<00:00:14.940> dispenser

will pop onto the water here we have

00:00:30.539 --> 00:00:33.680 
will pop onto the water here we have
track<00:00:31.380> and<00:00:31.710> you<00:00:31.740> can<00:00:32.640> place<00:00:32.940> mine<00:00:33.180> carts<00:00:33.480> there

00:00:33.680 --> 00:00:33.690 
track and you can place mine carts there

00:00:33.690 --> 00:00:35.600 
track and you can place mine carts there
this<00:00:34.170> works<00:00:34.469> obviously<00:00:34.680> with<00:00:35.130> normal<00:00:35.460> mine

00:00:35.600 --> 00:00:35.610 
this works obviously with normal mine

00:00:35.610 --> 00:00:37.819 
this works obviously with normal mine
carts<00:00:35.940> or<00:00:36.180> with<00:00:36.780> any<00:00:37.050> other<00:00:37.230> types<00:00:37.530> of<00:00:37.649> mine

00:00:37.829 --> 00:00:40.930 
carts or with any other types of mine
carts<00:00:38.690> here<00:00:39.690> we<00:00:39.840> have<00:00:39.930> flint<00:00:40.230> and<00:00:40.320> steel<00:00:40.500> and

00:00:40.930 --> 00:00:40.940 
carts here we have flint and steel and

00:00:40.940 --> 00:00:43.790 
carts here we have flint and steel and
that<00:00:41.940> is<00:00:42.120> going<00:00:42.300> to<00:00:42.570> set<00:00:43.110> a<00:00:43.140> nice<00:00:43.350> little<00:00:43.620> fire

00:00:43.790 --> 00:00:43.800 
that is going to set a nice little fire

00:00:43.800 --> 00:00:45.740 
that is going to set a nice little fire
in<00:00:43.860> front<00:00:44.250> of<00:00:44.340> your<00:00:44.430> dispenser<00:00:44.940> that<00:00:45.480> can<00:00:45.660> be

00:00:45.740 --> 00:00:45.750 
in front of your dispenser that can be

00:00:45.750 --> 00:00:48.680 
in front of your dispenser that can be
useful<00:00:45.870> for<00:00:46.110> a<00:00:46.350> variety<00:00:46.590> of<00:00:46.920> reasons<00:00:47.149> but<00:00:48.149> keep

00:00:48.680 --> 00:00:48.690 
useful for a variety of reasons but keep

00:00:48.690 --> 00:00:50.750 
useful for a variety of reasons but keep
in<00:00:48.840> mind<00:00:48.870> the<00:00:49.649> flint<00:00:49.890> and<00:00:49.920> steel<00:00:50.039> will<00:00:50.370> get<00:00:50.579> its

00:00:50.750 --> 00:00:50.760 
in mind the flint and steel will get its

00:00:50.760 --> 00:00:53.090 
in mind the flint and steel will get its
durability<00:00:51.180> used<00:00:51.570> up<00:00:51.780> so<00:00:51.989> you<00:00:52.350> might<00:00:52.860> want<00:00:53.010> to

00:00:53.090 --> 00:00:53.100 
durability used up so you might want to

00:00:53.100 --> 00:00:54.380 
durability used up so you might want to
put<00:00:53.250> extras<00:00:53.670> in<00:00:53.820> there<00:00:53.969> if<00:00:54.090> you're<00:00:54.239> going<00:00:54.329> to

00:00:54.380 --> 00:00:54.390 
put extras in there if you're going to

00:00:54.390 --> 00:00:56.660 
put extras in there if you're going to
be<00:00:54.750> lighting<00:00:55.079> a<00:00:55.140> lot<00:00:55.289> of<00:00:55.410> things<00:00:55.590> or<00:00:55.920> just<00:00:55.949> keep

00:00:56.660 --> 00:00:56.670 
be lighting a lot of things or just keep

00:00:56.670 --> 00:00:59.200 
be lighting a lot of things or just keep
that<00:00:56.789> in<00:00:56.850> mind<00:00:57.090> so<00:00:57.239> you<00:00:57.300> can<00:00:57.480> replace<00:00:57.750> it<00:00:57.930> later

00:00:59.200 --> 00:00:59.210 
that in mind so you can replace it later

00:00:59.210 --> 00:01:01.880 
that in mind so you can replace it later
you<00:01:00.210> can<00:01:00.359> also<00:01:00.480> use<00:01:00.600> bone<00:01:01.020> meal<00:01:01.230> so<00:01:01.530> I'll<00:01:01.649> play

00:01:01.880 --> 00:01:01.890 
you can also use bone meal so I'll play

00:01:01.890 --> 00:01:04.690 
you can also use bone meal so I'll play
some<00:01:01.920> seeds<00:01:02.399> here<00:01:02.760> and<00:01:03.390> the<00:01:03.690> bone<00:01:03.870> meal<00:01:04.049> will

00:01:04.690 --> 00:01:04.700 
some seeds here and the bone meal will

00:01:04.700 --> 00:01:07.810 
some seeds here and the bone meal will
encourage<00:01:05.700> the<00:01:05.909> seeds<00:01:06.119> to<00:01:06.330> grow

00:01:07.810 --> 00:01:07.820 
encourage the seeds to grow

00:01:07.820 --> 00:01:10.450 
encourage the seeds to grow
and<00:01:08.420> bone<00:01:09.260> meal<00:01:09.290> of<00:01:09.560> course<00:01:09.770> has<00:01:09.890> been<00:01:10.070> changed

00:01:10.450 --> 00:01:10.460 
and bone meal of course has been changed

00:01:10.460 --> 00:01:13.050 
and bone meal of course has been changed
so<00:01:10.640> it's<00:01:10.940> not<00:01:11.390> going<00:01:11.659> to<00:01:11.840> be<00:01:11.960> a<00:01:11.990> one-shot<00:01:12.260> deal

00:01:13.050 --> 00:01:13.060 
so it's not going to be a one-shot deal

00:01:13.060 --> 00:01:16.030 
so it's not going to be a one-shot deal
next<00:01:14.060> up<00:01:14.180> we<00:01:14.330> have<00:01:14.360> armor<00:01:14.990> and<00:01:15.170> if<00:01:15.620> you<00:01:15.740> stand

in front of this dispenser and hit the
button<00:01:18.320> it'll<00:01:18.770> pop<00:01:19.070> out<00:01:19.220> some<00:01:19.490> armor<00:01:19.790> and

00:01:19.960 --> 00:01:19.970 
button it'll pop out some armor and

00:01:19.970 --> 00:01:22.150 
button it'll pop out some armor and
you'll<00:01:20.720> see<00:01:20.960> that<00:01:21.110> that<00:01:21.290> armor<00:01:21.619> won't<00:01:21.890> go<00:01:22.040> into

00:01:22.150 --> 00:01:22.160 
you'll see that that armor won't go into

00:01:22.160 --> 00:01:23.440 
you'll see that that armor won't go into
your<00:01:22.310> inventory<00:01:22.520> it'll<00:01:23.000> actually<00:01:23.180> get

00:01:23.440 --> 00:01:23.450 
your inventory it'll actually get

00:01:23.450 --> 00:01:25.660 
your inventory it'll actually get
equipped<00:01:23.810> directly<00:01:24.350> onto<00:01:24.500> you<00:01:24.770> so<00:01:25.430> this<00:01:25.640> is

00:01:25.660 --> 00:01:25.670 
equipped directly onto you so this is

00:01:25.670 --> 00:01:27.370 
equipped directly onto you so this is
great<00:01:25.940> if<00:01:26.150> you're<00:01:26.240> setting<00:01:26.540> up<00:01:26.660> a<00:01:26.780> adventure

00:01:27.370 --> 00:01:27.380 
great if you're setting up a adventure

00:01:27.380 --> 00:01:29.170 
great if you're setting up a adventure

00:01:29.170 --> 00:01:29.180 
map and obviously you'd want to have

00:01:29.180 --> 00:01:31.810 
map and obviously you'd want to have
this<00:01:29.330> set<00:01:29.570> up<00:01:29.600> to<00:01:29.869> a<00:01:29.900> redstone<00:01:30.410> pulser<00:01:31.040> rather

00:01:31.810 --> 00:01:31.820 
this set up to a redstone pulser rather

00:01:31.820 --> 00:01:34.420 
this set up to a redstone pulser rather
than<00:01:32.060> just<00:01:32.619> having<00:01:33.619> them<00:01:33.830> press<00:01:34.070> the<00:01:34.190> button

00:01:41.460 --> 00:01:44.040 

next<00:01:42.460> we<00:01:42.580> have<00:01:42.640> an<00:01:42.790> example<00:01:43.060> of<00:01:43.300> a<00:01:43.510> facing<00:01:43.930> up

00:01:44.040 --> 00:01:44.050 
next we have an example of a facing up

00:01:44.050 --> 00:01:45.870 
next we have an example of a facing up
dispenser<00:01:44.620> and<00:01:44.800> that<00:01:45.130> will<00:01:45.220> launch<00:01:45.370> out<00:01:45.610> fire

00:01:45.870 --> 00:01:45.880 
dispenser and that will launch out fire

00:01:45.880 --> 00:01:54.150 
dispenser and that will launch out fire
charges<00:01:49.979> and<00:01:52.080> last<00:01:53.080> but<00:01:53.170> not<00:01:53.380> least<00:01:53.440> if<00:01:53.920> you

00:01:54.150 --> 00:01:54.160 
charges and last but not least if you
