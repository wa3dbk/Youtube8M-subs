00:00:07.120 --> 00:00:09.670 

last<00:00:08.120> summer<00:00:08.360> working<00:00:08.780> on<00:00:08.930> the<00:00:09.110> lawn<00:00:09.410> chair

00:00:09.670 --> 00:00:09.680 
last summer working on the lawn chair

00:00:09.680 --> 00:00:11.830 
last summer working on the lawn chair
video<00:00:09.950> I<00:00:10.220> needed<00:00:10.610> the<00:00:10.760> sound<00:00:11.060> of<00:00:11.210> the<00:00:11.300> bandsaw

00:00:11.830 --> 00:00:11.840 
video I needed the sound of the bandsaw

00:00:11.840 --> 00:00:14.500 
video I needed the sound of the bandsaw
going<00:00:12.650> through<00:00:12.890> curves<00:00:13.340> so<00:00:14.150> I<00:00:14.180> cut<00:00:14.390> up<00:00:14.420> some

00:00:14.500 --> 00:00:14.510 
going through curves so I cut up some

00:00:14.510 --> 00:00:16.630 
going through curves so I cut up some
scrap<00:00:14.930> pieces<00:00:15.200> of<00:00:15.320> wood<00:00:15.440> and<00:00:15.800> I<00:00:15.890> ended<00:00:16.219> up<00:00:16.369> with

00:00:16.630 --> 00:00:16.640 
scrap pieces of wood and I ended up with

00:00:16.640 --> 00:00:19.689 
scrap pieces of wood and I ended up with
these<00:00:16.820> pieces<00:00:17.509> that<00:00:17.720> stack<00:00:18.259> together<00:00:18.699> because

00:00:19.689 --> 00:00:19.699 
these pieces that stack together because

00:00:19.699 --> 00:00:22.659 
these pieces that stack together because
I<00:00:19.789> needed<00:00:19.970> a<00:00:20.150> long<00:00:20.419> cut<00:00:21.169> for<00:00:21.439> the<00:00:21.529> sound<00:00:21.859> and<00:00:22.189> I

00:00:22.659 --> 00:00:22.669 
I needed a long cut for the sound and I

00:00:22.669 --> 00:00:24.130 
I needed a long cut for the sound and I
realized<00:00:23.029> at<00:00:23.240> the<00:00:23.359> time<00:00:23.390> that<00:00:23.779> it<00:00:23.929> would<00:00:24.050> have

00:00:24.130 --> 00:00:24.140 
realized at the time that it would have

00:00:24.140 --> 00:00:27.189 
realized at the time that it would have
made<00:00:24.320> a<00:00:24.349> nice<00:00:24.560> toy<00:00:25.159> just<00:00:25.519> the<00:00:25.609> way<00:00:25.730> it<00:00:25.789> was<00:00:26.199> but

00:00:27.189 --> 00:00:27.199 
made a nice toy just the way it was but

00:00:27.199 --> 00:00:28.779 
made a nice toy just the way it was but
I<00:00:27.289> didn't<00:00:27.560> think<00:00:27.710> too<00:00:27.919> much<00:00:28.039> about<00:00:28.099> it<00:00:28.400> after

00:00:28.779 --> 00:00:28.789 
I didn't think too much about it after

00:00:28.789 --> 00:00:30.939 
I didn't think too much about it after
that<00:00:28.909> so<00:00:29.539> now<00:00:29.689> it's<00:00:29.839> catalog<00:00:30.319> season<00:00:30.769> and

00:00:30.939 --> 00:00:30.949 
that so now it's catalog season and

00:00:30.949 --> 00:00:32.979 
that so now it's catalog season and
we've<00:00:31.249> been<00:00:31.429> inundated<00:00:31.699> I<00:00:32.210> was<00:00:32.660> flipping

00:00:32.979 --> 00:00:32.989 
we've been inundated I was flipping

00:00:32.989 --> 00:00:34.660 
we've been inundated I was flipping
through<00:00:33.020> one<00:00:33.350> of<00:00:33.380> the<00:00:33.560> toy<00:00:33.770> catalogues<00:00:34.370> and

00:00:34.660 --> 00:00:34.670 
through one of the toy catalogues and

00:00:34.670 --> 00:00:36.460 
through one of the toy catalogues and
came<00:00:35.330> across<00:00:35.450> something<00:00:35.930> that<00:00:36.170> looked<00:00:36.380> like

00:00:36.460 --> 00:00:36.470 
came across something that looked like

00:00:36.470 --> 00:00:39.040 
came across something that looked like
what<00:00:36.860> had<00:00:37.010> done<00:00:37.250> last<00:00:37.790> summer<00:00:38.150> and<00:00:38.480> it

00:00:39.040 --> 00:00:39.050 
what had done last summer and it

00:00:39.050 --> 00:00:41.170 
what had done last summer and it
reminded<00:00:39.500> me<00:00:39.650> that<00:00:39.680> I<00:00:39.860> had<00:00:40.160> wanted<00:00:40.370> to<00:00:40.760> make

00:00:41.170 --> 00:00:41.180 
reminded me that I had wanted to make

00:00:41.180 --> 00:00:43.030 
reminded me that I had wanted to make
that<00:00:41.390> into<00:00:41.630> something<00:00:41.870> and<00:00:42.200> I<00:00:42.530> realized<00:00:42.860> that

00:00:43.030 --> 00:00:43.040 
that into something and I realized that

00:00:43.040 --> 00:00:45.760 
that into something and I realized that
I<00:00:43.100> have<00:00:43.370> a<00:00:43.400> nephew<00:00:43.700> who's<00:00:44.240> one<00:00:44.960> and<00:00:45.110> a<00:00:45.140> half<00:00:45.380> it

00:00:45.760 --> 00:00:45.770 
I have a nephew who's one and a half it

00:00:45.770 --> 00:00:47.710 
I have a nephew who's one and a half it
would<00:00:45.920> be<00:00:45.950> perfect<00:00:46.520> make<00:00:47.270> something<00:00:47.600> like

00:00:47.710 --> 00:00:47.720 
would be perfect make something like

00:00:47.720 --> 00:00:50.170 
would be perfect make something like
this<00:00:47.930> for<00:00:48.170> him<00:00:48.320> for<00:00:48.710> Christmas<00:00:48.860> so<00:00:49.760> I<00:00:49.790> set<00:00:50.030> to

00:00:50.170 --> 00:00:50.180 
this for him for Christmas so I set to

00:00:50.180 --> 00:00:52.990 
this for him for Christmas so I set to
work<00:00:50.210> to<00:00:51.080> make<00:00:51.230> a<00:00:51.260> stacking<00:00:51.740> toy<00:00:51.920> I<00:00:52.220> thought

00:00:52.990 --> 00:00:53.000 
work to make a stacking toy I thought

00:00:53.000 --> 00:00:54.490 
work to make a stacking toy I thought
was<00:00:53.300> because<00:00:53.720> I<00:00:53.870> was<00:00:53.990> going<00:00:54.020> to<00:00:54.170> have<00:00:54.260> a<00:00:54.290> lot<00:00:54.470> of

00:00:54.490 --> 00:00:54.500 
was because I was going to have a lot of

00:00:54.500 --> 00:00:56.980 
was because I was going to have a lot of
thin<00:00:54.950> pieces<00:00:55.940> of<00:00:56.090> wood<00:00:56.210> that<00:00:56.420> changed

00:00:56.980 --> 00:00:56.990 
thin pieces of wood that changed

00:00:56.990 --> 00:00:59.500 
thin pieces of wood that changed
direction<00:00:57.880> dramatically<00:00:58.880> that<00:00:59.090> I<00:00:59.270> would

00:00:59.500 --> 00:00:59.510 
direction dramatically that I would

00:00:59.510 --> 00:01:01.360 
direction dramatically that I would
sandwich<00:01:00.079> three<00:01:00.650> pieces<00:01:00.950> of<00:01:01.070> wood<00:01:01.220> together

00:01:01.360 --> 00:01:01.370 
sandwich three pieces of wood together

00:01:01.370 --> 00:01:07.149 
sandwich three pieces of wood together
sort<00:01:02.090> of<00:01:02.150> like<00:01:02.210> a<00:01:02.360> thick<00:01:02.690> piece<00:01:02.870> of<00:01:02.930> plywood

00:01:07.149 --> 00:01:07.159 

00:01:07.159 --> 00:01:10.149 

so<00:01:07.790> I<00:01:07.820> rethought<00:01:08.180> a<00:01:08.420> piece<00:01:08.750> of<00:01:08.960> walnut<00:01:09.259> in<00:01:09.710> half

00:01:10.149 --> 00:01:10.159 
so I rethought a piece of walnut in half

00:01:10.159 --> 00:01:13.209 
so I rethought a piece of walnut in half
to<00:01:10.850> make<00:01:11.030> two<00:01:11.360> sides<00:01:11.689> that<00:01:12.170> would<00:01:12.289> sandwich<00:01:12.890> a

00:01:13.209 --> 00:01:13.219 
to make two sides that would sandwich a

00:01:13.219 --> 00:01:15.429 
to make two sides that would sandwich a
piece<00:01:13.399> of<00:01:13.700> Purple<00:01:14.240> Heart<00:01:14.479> in<00:01:14.689> between<00:01:15.110> I

00:01:15.429 --> 00:01:15.439 
piece of Purple Heart in between I

00:01:15.439 --> 00:01:18.609 
piece of Purple Heart in between I
jointed<00:01:16.310> the<00:01:16.430> piece<00:01:16.640> of<00:01:16.880> walnut<00:01:17.570> to<00:01:18.350> make<00:01:18.500> it

00:01:18.609 --> 00:01:18.619 
jointed the piece of walnut to make it

00:01:18.619 --> 00:01:19.630 
jointed the piece of walnut to make it
perfectly<00:01:19.009> flat

00:01:19.630 --> 00:01:19.640 
perfectly flat

00:01:19.640 --> 00:01:23.169 
perfectly flat
I<00:01:20.289> cut<00:01:21.289> the<00:01:21.649> Purple<00:01:22.070> Heart<00:01:22.250> and<00:01:22.429> the<00:01:22.789> walnut

00:01:23.169 --> 00:01:23.179 
I cut the Purple Heart and the walnut

00:01:23.179 --> 00:01:26.740 
I cut the Purple Heart and the walnut
into<00:01:23.450> squares<00:01:23.840> and<00:01:25.179> made<00:01:26.179> Purple<00:01:26.569> Heart

00:01:26.740 --> 00:01:26.750 
into squares and made Purple Heart

00:01:26.750 --> 00:01:30.789 
into squares and made Purple Heart
sandwiches<00:01:27.439> with<00:01:27.619> walnut<00:01:28.069> bread<00:01:28.310> I<00:01:29.679> needed<00:01:30.679> to

00:01:30.789 --> 00:01:30.799 
sandwiches with walnut bread I needed to

00:01:30.799 --> 00:01:32.679 
sandwiches with walnut bread I needed to
get<00:01:30.920> the<00:01:31.069> glue<00:01:31.369> very<00:01:31.670> even<00:01:32.090> because<00:01:32.420> I<00:01:32.450> was

00:01:32.679 --> 00:01:32.689 
get the glue very even because I was

00:01:32.689 --> 00:01:35.080 
get the glue very even because I was
going<00:01:32.810> to<00:01:32.899> be<00:01:33.020> cutting<00:01:33.409> out<00:01:33.679> shapes<00:01:34.610> and<00:01:35.000> I

00:01:35.080 --> 00:01:35.090 
going to be cutting out shapes and I

00:01:35.090 --> 00:01:37.330 
going to be cutting out shapes and I
couldn't<00:01:35.329> have<00:01:35.479> any<00:01:35.630> gaps<00:01:35.899> in<00:01:36.229> the<00:01:36.350> glue<00:01:36.649> it

00:01:37.330 --> 00:01:37.340 
couldn't have any gaps in the glue it

00:01:37.340 --> 00:01:39.249 
couldn't have any gaps in the glue it
got<00:01:37.520> a<00:01:37.759> little<00:01:38.119> bit<00:01:38.299> messy<00:01:38.569> gluing<00:01:38.960> them<00:01:39.079> up

00:01:39.249 --> 00:01:39.259 
got a little bit messy gluing them up

00:01:39.259 --> 00:01:42.730 
got a little bit messy gluing them up
but<00:01:39.619> but<00:01:40.189> it<00:01:40.280> worked<00:01:40.429> okay<00:01:40.789> I<00:01:41.500> needed<00:01:42.500> to<00:01:42.590> use<00:01:42.709> a

00:01:42.730 --> 00:01:42.740 
but but it worked okay I needed to use a

00:01:42.740 --> 00:01:44.770 
but but it worked okay I needed to use a
lot<00:01:43.099> of<00:01:43.130> clamps<00:01:43.640> not<00:01:43.789> so<00:01:43.970> much<00:01:44.119> to<00:01:44.299> get<00:01:44.390> a<00:01:44.599> lot

00:01:44.770 --> 00:01:44.780 
lot of clamps not so much to get a lot

00:01:44.780 --> 00:01:47.230 
lot of clamps not so much to get a lot
of<00:01:44.929> pressure<00:01:45.200> but<00:01:45.500> just<00:01:45.709> to<00:01:45.830> get<00:01:46.069> but<00:01:47.000> to<00:01:47.119> get

00:01:47.230 --> 00:01:47.240 
of pressure but just to get but to get

00:01:47.240 --> 00:01:50.289 
of pressure but just to get but to get
the<00:01:47.390> pressure<00:01:47.659> even<00:01:48.020> so<00:01:48.890> that<00:01:49.459> the<00:01:49.640> glue<00:01:50.000> joint

00:01:50.289 --> 00:01:50.299 
the pressure even so that the glue joint

00:01:50.299 --> 00:01:52.510 
the pressure even so that the glue joint
was<00:01:50.420> very<00:01:50.599> even<00:01:50.899> and<00:01:51.020> the<00:01:51.799> outside<00:01:52.159> didn't

00:01:52.510 --> 00:01:52.520 
was very even and the outside didn't

00:01:52.520 --> 00:01:53.710 
was very even and the outside didn't
matter<00:01:52.640> so<00:01:52.970> much<00:01:53.030> as<00:01:53.179> far<00:01:53.479> as<00:01:53.509> what<00:01:53.689> that

00:01:53.710 --> 00:01:53.720 
matter so much as far as what that

00:01:53.720 --> 00:01:55.839 
matter so much as far as what that
looked<00:01:54.049> like<00:01:54.140> I<00:01:54.470> did<00:01:54.979> need<00:01:55.130> one<00:01:55.369> side<00:01:55.640> to<00:01:55.819> be

00:01:55.839 --> 00:01:55.849 
looked like I did need one side to be

00:01:55.849 --> 00:01:59.199 
looked like I did need one side to be
flush<00:01:56.479> are<00:01:57.170> fairly<00:01:57.679> flush<00:01:58.069> so<00:01:58.429> that<00:01:58.610> I<00:01:58.789> could

00:01:59.199 --> 00:01:59.209 
flush are fairly flush so that I could

00:01:59.209 --> 00:02:00.370 
flush are fairly flush so that I could
use<00:01:59.240> that<00:01:59.420> side

00:02:00.370 --> 00:02:00.380 
use that side

00:02:00.380 --> 00:02:02.710 
use that side
to<00:02:00.560> get<00:02:01.039> started<00:02:01.459> squaring<00:02:01.939> up<00:02:02.090> the<00:02:02.270> piece<00:02:02.479> on

00:02:02.710 --> 00:02:02.720 
to get started squaring up the piece on

00:02:02.720 --> 00:02:06.609 
to get started squaring up the piece on
the<00:02:02.810> table<00:02:02.959> saw<00:02:04.329> so<00:02:05.329> I<00:02:05.360> clean<00:02:05.689> the<00:02:05.810> glue<00:02:06.079> off<00:02:06.289> of

00:02:06.609 --> 00:02:06.619 
the table saw so I clean the glue off of

00:02:06.619 --> 00:02:11.530 
the table saw so I clean the glue off of
that<00:02:06.890> side<00:02:07.189> and<00:02:08.470> then<00:02:09.470> sand<00:02:09.860> it<00:02:09.979> that<00:02:10.190> side<00:02:10.540> and

00:02:11.530 --> 00:02:11.540 
that side and then sand it that side and

00:02:11.540 --> 00:02:14.319 
that side and then sand it that side and
then<00:02:11.959> once<00:02:12.140> I<00:02:12.290> had<00:02:12.470> that<00:02:12.500> one<00:02:13.250> flat<00:02:13.670> face<00:02:14.030> I

00:02:14.319 --> 00:02:14.329 
then once I had that one flat face I

00:02:14.329 --> 00:02:16.539 
then once I had that one flat face I
could<00:02:14.540> use<00:02:14.750> that<00:02:14.780> to<00:02:15.319> square<00:02:15.650> up<00:02:15.829> the<00:02:16.069> rest<00:02:16.430> of

00:02:16.539 --> 00:02:16.549 
could use that to square up the rest of

00:02:16.549 --> 00:02:19.270 
could use that to square up the rest of
the<00:02:16.640> piece<00:02:16.850> on<00:02:17.090> the<00:02:17.120> table<00:02:17.540> saw<00:02:17.980> once<00:02:18.980> I<00:02:19.100> had

00:02:19.270 --> 00:02:19.280 
the piece on the table saw once I had

00:02:19.280 --> 00:02:22.150 
the piece on the table saw once I had
two<00:02:19.609> flat<00:02:19.940> sides<00:02:20.209> I<00:02:20.510> could<00:02:20.690> put<00:02:20.900> a<00:02:20.930> stop<00:02:21.350> on<00:02:21.650> the

00:02:22.150 --> 00:02:22.160 
two flat sides I could put a stop on the

00:02:22.160 --> 00:02:24.460 
two flat sides I could put a stop on the
sled<00:02:22.519> but<00:02:23.389> you<00:02:23.510> mean<00:02:23.660> that<00:02:23.840> I<00:02:23.989> could<00:02:24.200> make<00:02:24.319> all

00:02:24.460 --> 00:02:24.470 
sled but you mean that I could make all

00:02:24.470 --> 00:02:26.349 
sled but you mean that I could make all
three<00:02:24.709> pieces<00:02:24.889> of<00:02:25.160> the<00:02:25.280> same<00:02:25.549> length<00:02:26.120> and

00:02:26.349 --> 00:02:26.359 
three pieces of the same length and

00:02:26.359 --> 00:02:29.710 
three pieces of the same length and
width<00:02:26.859> so<00:02:27.859> I<00:02:27.889> had<00:02:28.100> three<00:02:28.340> squares<00:02:28.790> so<00:02:29.690> I

00:02:29.710 --> 00:02:29.720 
width so I had three squares so I

00:02:29.720 --> 00:02:32.440 
width so I had three squares so I
sketched<00:02:30.109> out<00:02:30.380> some<00:02:30.799> shapes<00:02:31.069> to<00:02:31.760> cut<00:02:32.000> out<00:02:32.150> and

00:02:32.440 --> 00:02:32.450 
sketched out some shapes to cut out and

00:02:32.450 --> 00:02:34.990 
sketched out some shapes to cut out and
they're<00:02:33.440> just<00:02:33.650> random<00:02:33.950> whimsical<00:02:34.730> shapes

00:02:34.990 --> 00:02:35.000 
they're just random whimsical shapes

00:02:35.000 --> 00:02:37.629 
they're just random whimsical shapes
that<00:02:35.269> would<00:02:35.389> be<00:02:35.569> fun<00:02:35.810> to<00:02:35.959> stack<00:02:36.260> one<00:02:37.220> sort<00:02:37.519> of

00:02:37.629 --> 00:02:37.639 
that would be fun to stack one sort of

00:02:37.639 --> 00:02:41.979 
that would be fun to stack one sort of
an<00:02:37.730> arch<00:02:37.970> one<00:02:38.630> sort<00:02:38.959> of<00:02:39.049> a<00:02:39.380> wave<00:02:39.829> and<00:02:40.310> ones<00:02:40.989> sort

00:02:41.979 --> 00:02:41.989 
an arch one sort of a wave and ones sort

00:02:41.989 --> 00:02:45.670 
an arch one sort of a wave and ones sort
of<00:02:42.109> an<00:02:42.230> arch<00:02:42.410> with<00:02:42.620> bumps<00:02:44.079> then<00:02:45.079> I<00:02:45.170> changed<00:02:45.560> the

00:02:45.670 --> 00:02:45.680 
of an arch with bumps then I changed the

00:02:45.680 --> 00:02:47.349 
of an arch with bumps then I changed the
blade<00:02:45.920> on<00:02:46.100> the<00:02:46.220> bandsaw<00:02:46.639> to<00:02:46.670> a<00:02:46.790> very<00:02:47.030> fine

00:02:47.349 --> 00:02:47.359 
blade on the bandsaw to a very fine

00:02:47.359 --> 00:02:49.240 
blade on the bandsaw to a very fine
blade<00:02:47.989> that<00:02:48.290> would<00:02:48.440> let<00:02:48.560> me<00:02:48.650> do<00:02:48.799> the<00:02:48.920> curves

00:02:49.240 --> 00:02:49.250 
blade that would let me do the curves

00:02:49.250 --> 00:02:51.240 
blade that would let me do the curves
that<00:02:49.549> I<00:02:49.579> was<00:02:49.760> going<00:02:49.880> to<00:02:49.970> going<00:02:50.269> to<00:02:50.299> need<00:02:50.510> to<00:02:50.660> do

00:02:51.240 --> 00:02:51.250 
that I was going to going to need to do

00:02:51.250 --> 00:02:54.720 
that I was going to going to need to do
then<00:02:52.000> I<00:02:52.090> just<00:02:52.270> free<00:02:52.690> handed<00:02:53.080> the<00:02:53.200> cuts<00:02:53.470> and<00:02:53.830> I

00:02:54.720 --> 00:02:54.730 
then I just free handed the cuts and I

00:02:54.730 --> 00:02:56.910 
then I just free handed the cuts and I
had<00:02:54.880> just<00:02:55.060> gotten<00:02:55.390> this<00:02:55.660> blade<00:02:55.990> back<00:02:56.380> from

00:02:56.910 --> 00:02:56.920 
had just gotten this blade back from

00:02:56.920 --> 00:02:58.620 
had just gotten this blade back from
being<00:02:57.070> sharpened<00:02:57.640> so<00:02:57.850> it<00:02:57.970> cut<00:02:58.180> very<00:02:58.420> nicely

00:02:58.620 --> 00:02:58.630 
being sharpened so it cut very nicely

00:02:58.630 --> 00:03:04.380 
being sharpened so it cut very nicely
and<00:02:59.440> it<00:02:59.530> left<00:02:59.710> a<00:02:59.860> very<00:03:00.040> nice<00:03:00.220> surface<00:03:03.390> then

00:03:04.380 --> 00:03:04.390 
and it left a very nice surface then

00:03:04.390 --> 00:03:06.660 
and it left a very nice surface then
what<00:03:04.630> I<00:03:04.660> wanted<00:03:04.960> to<00:03:05.050> do<00:03:05.200> was<00:03:05.410> to<00:03:05.710> round<00:03:06.340> over

00:03:06.660 --> 00:03:06.670 
what I wanted to do was to round over

00:03:06.670 --> 00:03:10.530 
what I wanted to do was to round over
that<00:03:07.420> cut<00:03:07.750> edge<00:03:08.400> so<00:03:09.400> I<00:03:09.459> found<00:03:09.730> my<00:03:09.850> smallest

00:03:10.530 --> 00:03:10.540 
that cut edge so I found my smallest

00:03:10.540 --> 00:03:12.330 
that cut edge so I found my smallest
round<00:03:11.080> over<00:03:11.350> bit<00:03:11.380> which<00:03:11.770> i<00:03:11.920> think<00:03:11.980> is<00:03:12.220> an

00:03:12.330 --> 00:03:12.340 
round over bit which i think is an

00:03:12.340 --> 00:03:14.940 
round over bit which i think is an
eighth<00:03:12.520> of<00:03:12.730> an<00:03:12.820> inch<00:03:12.970> and<00:03:13.330> I<00:03:14.320> went<00:03:14.500> around<00:03:14.590> to

00:03:14.940 --> 00:03:14.950 
eighth of an inch and I went around to

00:03:14.950 --> 00:03:17.430 
eighth of an inch and I went around to
all<00:03:15.280> of<00:03:15.459> the<00:03:15.580> curves<00:03:15.900> services<00:03:16.900> and<00:03:17.110> knocked

00:03:17.430 --> 00:03:17.440 
all of the curves services and knocked

00:03:17.440 --> 00:03:19.980 
all of the curves services and knocked
down<00:03:17.680> that<00:03:17.950> edge<00:03:18.570> which<00:03:19.570> would<00:03:19.720> make<00:03:19.840> the

00:03:19.980 --> 00:03:19.990 
down that edge which would make the

00:03:19.990 --> 00:03:22.980 
down that edge which would make the
piece<00:03:20.200> less<00:03:21.130> sharp<00:03:21.550> obviously<00:03:22.209> but<00:03:22.450> it<00:03:22.780> would

00:03:22.980 --> 00:03:22.990 
piece less sharp obviously but it would

00:03:22.990 --> 00:03:25.740 
piece less sharp obviously but it would
also<00:03:23.370> accentuate<00:03:24.370> the<00:03:24.700> cuts<00:03:25.209> a<00:03:25.420> little<00:03:25.540> bit

00:03:25.740 --> 00:03:25.750 
also accentuate the cuts a little bit

00:03:25.750 --> 00:03:28.350 
also accentuate the cuts a little bit
more<00:03:25.989> when<00:03:26.200> the<00:03:26.320> pieces<00:03:26.709> put<00:03:26.890> together<00:03:27.360> you

00:03:28.350 --> 00:03:28.360 
more when the pieces put together you

00:03:28.360 --> 00:03:30.930 
more when the pieces put together you
can<00:03:28.420> see<00:03:28.780> the<00:03:28.930> sandwich<00:03:29.290> of<00:03:29.800> the<00:03:30.070> walnut<00:03:30.760> and

00:03:30.930 --> 00:03:30.940 
can see the sandwich of the walnut and

00:03:30.940 --> 00:03:34.620 
can see the sandwich of the walnut and
the<00:03:31.030> Purple<00:03:31.480> Heart<00:03:32.970> then<00:03:33.970> the<00:03:34.090> edges<00:03:34.420> that<00:03:34.570> I

00:03:34.620 --> 00:03:34.630 
the Purple Heart then the edges that I

00:03:34.630 --> 00:03:36.150 
the Purple Heart then the edges that I
couldn't<00:03:34.959> get<00:03:35.050> with<00:03:35.170> the<00:03:35.260> shaper<00:03:35.680> I<00:03:35.709> did<00:03:36.040> on

00:03:36.150 --> 00:03:36.160 
couldn't get with the shaper I did on

00:03:36.160 --> 00:03:39.870 
couldn't get with the shaper I did on
the<00:03:36.280> dis<00:03:36.459> sander<00:03:37.770> then<00:03:38.770> some<00:03:39.040> of<00:03:39.130> the<00:03:39.190> concave

00:03:39.870 --> 00:03:39.880 
the dis sander then some of the concave

00:03:39.880 --> 00:03:42.650 
the dis sander then some of the concave
curves<00:03:40.270> I<00:03:40.510> did<00:03:40.750> with<00:03:41.050> the<00:03:41.320> spindle<00:03:41.980> sander<00:03:42.160> and

00:03:42.650 --> 00:03:42.660 
curves I did with the spindle sander and

00:03:42.660 --> 00:03:45.300 
curves I did with the spindle sander and
there<00:03:43.660> was<00:03:43.810> a<00:03:43.840> little<00:03:44.140> bit<00:03:44.290> of<00:03:44.440> burning<00:03:45.070> from

00:03:45.300 --> 00:03:45.310 
there was a little bit of burning from

00:03:45.310 --> 00:03:49.670 
there was a little bit of burning from
the<00:03:45.520> bandsaw<00:03:46.239> so<00:03:46.900> I<00:03:46.930> tried<00:03:47.320> to<00:03:47.470> cut<00:03:47.830> that<00:03:47.980> off<00:03:48.040> I

00:03:49.670 --> 00:03:49.680 
the bandsaw so I tried to cut that off I

00:03:49.680 --> 00:03:52.560 
the bandsaw so I tried to cut that off I
tilted<00:03:50.680> the<00:03:50.830> table<00:03:51.280> to<00:03:51.880> the<00:03:51.970> spindle<00:03:52.239> sander

00:03:52.560 --> 00:03:52.570 
tilted the table to the spindle sander

00:03:52.570 --> 00:03:55.440 
tilted the table to the spindle sander
to<00:03:52.870> get<00:03:53.110> some<00:03:53.500> of<00:03:53.590> the<00:03:53.680> smaller<00:03:54.070> pieces<00:03:54.430> as<00:03:55.120> I

00:03:55.440 --> 00:03:55.450 
to get some of the smaller pieces as I

00:03:55.450 --> 00:03:57.720 
to get some of the smaller pieces as I
couldn't<00:03:55.810> hold<00:03:56.200> those<00:03:56.380> on<00:03:56.590> the<00:03:56.709> router<00:03:56.980> safely

00:03:57.720 --> 00:03:57.730 
couldn't hold those on the router safely

00:03:57.730 --> 00:04:00.660 
couldn't hold those on the router safely
so<00:03:58.540> I<00:03:58.570> knocked<00:03:58.870> down<00:03:59.080> the<00:03:59.290> edges<00:03:59.440> with<00:04:00.310> the

00:04:00.660 --> 00:04:00.670 
so I knocked down the edges with the

00:04:00.670 --> 00:04:03.570 
so I knocked down the edges with the
spindle<00:04:01.360> sander<00:04:01.660> with<00:04:01.930> a<00:04:01.959> table<00:04:02.470> tilted<00:04:03.040> at<00:04:03.160> 45

00:04:03.570 --> 00:04:03.580 
spindle sander with a table tilted at 45

00:04:03.580 --> 00:04:06.840 
spindle sander with a table tilted at 45
degrees<00:04:04.140> then<00:04:05.140> it<00:04:05.290> was<00:04:05.380> time<00:04:05.590> for<00:04:05.620> finish<00:04:06.160> and

00:04:06.840 --> 00:04:06.850 
degrees then it was time for finish and

00:04:06.850 --> 00:04:09.810 
degrees then it was time for finish and
this<00:04:06.970> is<00:04:07.090> the<00:04:07.209> same<00:04:07.480> linseed<00:04:08.260> oil<00:04:08.410> beeswax<00:04:09.400> mix

00:04:09.810 --> 00:04:09.820 
this is the same linseed oil beeswax mix

00:04:09.820 --> 00:04:19.830 
this is the same linseed oil beeswax mix
I've<00:04:10.000> been<00:04:10.120> using<00:04:10.299> it's<00:04:10.959> very<00:04:11.170> safe<00:04:11.470> for<00:04:12.070> kids

00:04:19.830 --> 00:04:19.840 

00:04:19.840 --> 00:04:22.179 

the<00:04:20.840> other<00:04:20.959> thing<00:04:21.169> I<00:04:21.259> wanted<00:04:21.499> to<00:04:21.650> do<00:04:21.829> is<00:04:22.009> to

00:04:22.179 --> 00:04:22.189 
the other thing I wanted to do is to

00:04:22.189 --> 00:04:24.969 
the other thing I wanted to do is to
make<00:04:22.370> a<00:04:22.400> box<00:04:22.789> for<00:04:23.270> these<00:04:23.389> to<00:04:23.539> go<00:04:23.749> in<00:04:23.930> so<00:04:24.710> I<00:04:24.740> cut

00:04:24.969 --> 00:04:24.979 
make a box for these to go in so I cut

00:04:24.979 --> 00:04:33.670 
make a box for these to go in so I cut
strips<00:04:28.840> and<00:04:30.639> then<00:04:31.639> four<00:04:31.939> sides<00:04:32.270> two<00:04:33.229> short

00:04:33.670 --> 00:04:33.680 
strips and then four sides two short

00:04:33.680 --> 00:04:37.239 
strips and then four sides two short
sides<00:04:33.889> and<00:04:34.310> two<00:04:34.460> long<00:04:34.669> sides<00:04:35.560> and<00:04:36.560> I<00:04:36.680> thought<00:04:37.219> I

00:04:37.239 --> 00:04:37.249 
sides and two long sides and I thought I

00:04:37.249 --> 00:04:40.239 
sides and two long sides and I thought I
would<00:04:37.550> do<00:04:37.729> a<00:04:37.759> box<00:04:38.180> joint<00:04:38.629> at<00:04:38.840> the<00:04:38.990> corners<00:04:39.469> so<00:04:40.159> I

00:04:40.239 --> 00:04:40.249 
would do a box joint at the corners so I

00:04:40.249 --> 00:04:44.019 
would do a box joint at the corners so I
put<00:04:40.550> in<00:04:40.669> the<00:04:40.909> dado<00:04:41.479> blade<00:04:42.729> the<00:04:43.729> way<00:04:43.849> that<00:04:43.999> I

00:04:44.019 --> 00:04:44.029 
put in the dado blade the way that I

00:04:44.029 --> 00:04:46.420 
put in the dado blade the way that I
found<00:04:44.330> to<00:04:44.509> do<00:04:44.629> box<00:04:44.900> joints<00:04:45.349> is<00:04:45.499> to<00:04:45.830> cut<00:04:46.249> out<00:04:46.279> a

00:04:46.420 --> 00:04:46.430 
found to do box joints is to cut out a

00:04:46.430 --> 00:04:50.230 
found to do box joints is to cut out a
stick<00:04:47.060> that's<00:04:47.689> the<00:04:48.080> size<00:04:48.439> of<00:04:48.889> the<00:04:49.279> hole<00:04:49.909> that

00:04:50.230 --> 00:04:50.240 
stick that's the size of the hole that

00:04:50.240 --> 00:04:52.360 
stick that's the size of the hole that
I'm<00:04:50.360> going<00:04:50.539> to<00:04:50.569> make<00:04:50.750> for<00:04:51.020> each<00:04:51.169> finger<00:04:51.770> on<00:04:51.979> the

00:04:52.360 --> 00:04:52.370 
I'm going to make for each finger on the

00:04:52.370 --> 00:04:55.149 
I'm going to make for each finger on the
box<00:04:52.580> joint<00:04:52.969> and<00:04:53.210> make<00:04:53.629> a<00:04:53.659> fence<00:04:54.169> for<00:04:54.500> the<00:04:54.889> miter

00:04:55.149 --> 00:04:55.159 
box joint and make a fence for the miter

00:04:55.159 --> 00:04:57.700 
box joint and make a fence for the miter
sled<00:04:55.550> and<00:04:55.879> have<00:04:56.689> the<00:04:56.810> stick<00:04:57.110> stick<00:04:57.469> out<00:04:57.680> of

00:04:57.700 --> 00:04:57.710 
sled and have the stick stick out of

00:04:57.710 --> 00:05:00.369 
sled and have the stick stick out of
that<00:04:58.009> fence<00:04:58.400> then<00:04:59.389> from<00:04:59.810> there<00:04:59.960> what<00:05:00.110> you<00:05:00.199> can

00:05:00.369 --> 00:05:00.379 
that fence then from there what you can

00:05:00.379 --> 00:05:06.129 
that fence then from there what you can
do<00:05:00.560> is<00:05:03.159> cut<00:05:04.159> each<00:05:04.400> finger<00:05:05.000> and<00:05:05.270> then<00:05:05.419> move<00:05:05.719> your

00:05:06.129 --> 00:05:06.139 
do is cut each finger and then move your

00:05:06.139 --> 00:05:09.010 
do is cut each finger and then move your
piece<00:05:06.860> over<00:05:07.159> and<00:05:07.370> it<00:05:07.669> sits<00:05:08.029> on<00:05:08.210> that<00:05:08.569> stick<00:05:08.990> and

00:05:09.010 --> 00:05:09.020 
piece over and it sits on that stick and

00:05:09.020 --> 00:05:10.990 
piece over and it sits on that stick and
I<00:05:09.289> stick<00:05:09.589> holds<00:05:10.009> it<00:05:10.129> at<00:05:10.250> the<00:05:10.400> right<00:05:10.610> location

00:05:10.990 --> 00:05:11.000 
I stick holds it at the right location

00:05:11.000 --> 00:05:14.140 
I stick holds it at the right location
and<00:05:11.629> you<00:05:12.589> can<00:05:12.620> just<00:05:12.949> sort<00:05:13.310> of<00:05:13.430> walk<00:05:13.699> the<00:05:13.969> piece

00:05:14.140 --> 00:05:14.150 
and you can just sort of walk the piece

00:05:14.150 --> 00:05:16.809 
and you can just sort of walk the piece
along<00:05:14.509> and<00:05:14.839> make<00:05:15.020> the<00:05:15.229> fingers<00:05:15.589> now<00:05:16.400> you<00:05:16.460> can

00:05:16.809 --> 00:05:16.819 
along and make the fingers now you can

00:05:16.819 --> 00:05:19.329 
along and make the fingers now you can
see<00:05:16.939> on<00:05:17.060> the<00:05:17.210> short<00:05:17.509> side<00:05:17.810> the<00:05:18.259> end<00:05:18.469> is<00:05:18.770> solid

00:05:19.329 --> 00:05:19.339 
see on the short side the end is solid

00:05:19.339 --> 00:05:22.749 
see on the short side the end is solid
and<00:05:19.580> on<00:05:20.060> the<00:05:20.180> long<00:05:20.360> side<00:05:20.629> the<00:05:20.810> end<00:05:21.020> is<00:05:21.620> a<00:05:21.680> gap<00:05:22.159> so

00:05:22.749 --> 00:05:22.759 
and on the long side the end is a gap so

00:05:22.759 --> 00:05:25.269 
and on the long side the end is a gap so
that<00:05:22.969> when<00:05:23.089> they<00:05:23.240> fit<00:05:23.779> together<00:05:24.139> the<00:05:24.289> solid

00:05:25.269 --> 00:05:25.279 
that when they fit together the solid

00:05:25.279 --> 00:05:27.100 
that when they fit together the solid
fingers<00:05:25.639> will<00:05:25.909> fit<00:05:26.210> into<00:05:26.360> the<00:05:26.449> void<00:05:26.810> of<00:05:27.050> the

00:05:27.100 --> 00:05:27.110 
fingers will fit into the void of the

00:05:27.110 --> 00:05:29.709 
fingers will fit into the void of the
fingers<00:05:27.680> on<00:05:27.860> the<00:05:27.949> other<00:05:28.069> side<00:05:28.449> now<00:05:29.449> for<00:05:29.629> the

00:05:29.709 --> 00:05:29.719 
fingers on the other side now for the

00:05:29.719 --> 00:05:32.110 
fingers on the other side now for the
top<00:05:30.110> and<00:05:30.349> bottom<00:05:30.500> I<00:05:30.860> had<00:05:31.279> some<00:05:31.580> pieces<00:05:31.939> of

00:05:32.110 --> 00:05:32.120 
top and bottom I had some pieces of

00:05:32.120 --> 00:05:34.329 
top and bottom I had some pieces of
salvaged<00:05:32.779> puck<00:05:33.080> sea<00:05:33.229> glass<00:05:33.349> that<00:05:33.740> I<00:05:33.830> had<00:05:34.069> and

00:05:34.329 --> 00:05:34.339 
salvaged puck sea glass that I had and

00:05:34.339 --> 00:05:37.300 
salvaged puck sea glass that I had and
they're<00:05:34.789> 1/4<00:05:35.750> of<00:05:35.839> an<00:05:35.930> inch<00:05:35.990> thick<00:05:36.379> so<00:05:36.649> I<00:05:36.830> had<00:05:37.189> to

00:05:37.300 --> 00:05:37.310 
they're 1/4 of an inch thick so I had to

00:05:37.310 --> 00:05:40.839 
they're 1/4 of an inch thick so I had to
cut<00:05:37.550> a<00:05:37.580> dado<00:05:38.060> in<00:05:38.569> the<00:05:38.930> sides<00:05:39.439> to<00:05:39.949> receive<00:05:40.399> the

00:05:40.839 --> 00:05:40.849 
cut a dado in the sides to receive the

00:05:40.849 --> 00:05:44.019 
cut a dado in the sides to receive the
piece<00:05:41.419> of<00:05:41.569> Plexiglas<00:05:42.370> so<00:05:43.370> this<00:05:43.819> is<00:05:43.909> how<00:05:43.969> the

00:05:44.019 --> 00:05:44.029 
piece of Plexiglas so this is how the

00:05:44.029 --> 00:05:46.300 
piece of Plexiglas so this is how the
Box<00:05:44.330> goes<00:05:44.629> together<00:05:44.810> when<00:05:45.409> the<00:05:45.500> sides<00:05:45.770> the

00:05:46.300 --> 00:05:46.310 
Box goes together when the sides the

00:05:46.310 --> 00:05:48.550 
Box goes together when the sides the
bottom

00:05:48.550 --> 00:05:48.560 
bottom

00:05:48.560 --> 00:05:52.040 
bottom
and<00:05:49.560> top<00:05:50.330> then<00:05:51.330> it<00:05:51.360> was<00:05:51.540> a<00:05:51.570> matter<00:05:51.780> of<00:05:51.870> gluing

00:05:52.040 --> 00:05:52.050 
and top then it was a matter of gluing

00:05:52.050 --> 00:05:54.080 
and top then it was a matter of gluing
the<00:05:52.470> sides<00:05:52.500> together<00:05:53.070> which<00:05:53.880> was

00:05:54.080 --> 00:05:54.090 
the sides together which was

00:05:54.090 --> 00:05:56.300 
the sides together which was
straightforward<00:05:54.360> I<00:05:54.930> did<00:05:55.380> need<00:05:55.560> to<00:05:55.620> remember

00:05:56.300 --> 00:05:56.310 
straightforward I did need to remember

00:05:56.310 --> 00:05:58.910 
straightforward I did need to remember
to<00:05:56.400> put<00:05:56.580> the<00:05:56.640> bottom<00:05:57.210> in<00:05:57.570> before<00:05:58.320> I<00:05:58.350> glued<00:05:58.740> the

00:05:58.910 --> 00:05:58.920 
to put the bottom in before I glued the

00:05:58.920 --> 00:06:01.160 
to put the bottom in before I glued the
last<00:05:59.100> side<00:05:59.400> on<00:05:59.670> as<00:05:59.940> the<00:06:00.390> bottom<00:06:00.660> will<00:06:00.780> be<00:06:00.900> glued

00:06:01.160 --> 00:06:01.170 
last side on as the bottom will be glued

00:06:01.170 --> 00:06:03.430 
last side on as the bottom will be glued
in<00:06:01.620> place<00:06:01.680> with<00:06:02.340> the<00:06:02.490> wood

00:06:03.430 --> 00:06:03.440 
in place with the wood

00:06:03.440 --> 00:06:05.810 
in place with the wood
once<00:06:04.440> the<00:06:04.560> glue<00:06:04.740> set<00:06:04.980> up<00:06:05.130> I<00:06:05.250> could<00:06:05.430> take<00:06:05.610> the

00:06:05.810 --> 00:06:05.820 
once the glue set up I could take the

00:06:05.820 --> 00:06:09.610 
once the glue set up I could take the
clamps<00:06:06.330> off<00:06:06.450> and<00:06:06.870> the<00:06:07.770> lid<00:06:07.980> slides<00:06:08.400> into<00:06:08.670> place

00:06:09.610 --> 00:06:09.620 
clamps off and the lid slides into place

clamps off and the lid slides into place
the<00:06:10.620> final<00:06:11.040> thing<00:06:11.220> to<00:06:11.250> do<00:06:11.460> to<00:06:11.580> the<00:06:11.670> box<00:06:11.880> is<00:06:12.120> just

00:06:12.380 --> 00:06:12.390 
the final thing to do to the box is just

00:06:12.390 --> 00:06:14.780 
the final thing to do to the box is just
to<00:06:12.510> clean<00:06:12.780> up<00:06:12.960> the<00:06:13.560> joints<00:06:14.040> and<00:06:14.160> the<00:06:14.250> top<00:06:14.580> and

00:06:14.780 --> 00:06:14.790 
to clean up the joints and the top and

00:06:14.790 --> 00:06:16.670 
to clean up the joints and the top and
the<00:06:14.850> bottom<00:06:15.000> so<00:06:15.750> they're<00:06:15.930> perfectly<00:06:16.290> flush

00:06:16.670 --> 00:06:16.680 
the bottom so they're perfectly flush

00:06:16.680 --> 00:06:19.880 
the bottom so they're perfectly flush
and<00:06:16.980> I<00:06:17.790> wanted<00:06:18.060> to<00:06:18.120> round<00:06:18.450> over<00:06:18.750> the<00:06:19.560> finger

00:06:19.880 --> 00:06:19.890 
and I wanted to round over the finger

00:06:19.890 --> 00:06:23.270 
and I wanted to round over the finger
joints<00:06:20.900> now<00:06:21.900> the<00:06:21.960> stacking<00:06:22.500> pieces<00:06:22.620> have<00:06:23.100> to

00:06:23.270 --> 00:06:23.280 
joints now the stacking pieces have to

00:06:23.280 --> 00:06:29.260 
joints now the stacking pieces have to
go<00:06:23.460> into<00:06:23.970> the<00:06:24.090> box

00:06:29.260 --> 00:06:29.270 

00:06:29.270 --> 00:06:34.460 

first<00:06:30.270> we<00:06:30.450> can<00:06:30.570> see<00:06:30.630> how<00:06:30.990> they<00:06:31.140> might<00:06:31.320> stack

00:06:34.460 --> 00:06:34.470 

00:06:34.470 --> 00:06:41.630 

and<00:06:35.010> then<00:06:35.280> sort<00:06:35.580> themselves<00:06:35.760> out<00:06:36.210> to<00:06:36.780> go

00:06:41.630 --> 00:06:41.640 

00:06:41.640 --> 00:06:44.190 

now<00:06:42.640> I'm<00:06:42.850> not<00:06:43.000> going<00:06:43.150> to<00:06:43.270> include<00:06:43.480> the<00:06:43.930> little

00:06:44.190 --> 00:06:44.200 
now I'm not going to include the little

00:06:44.200 --> 00:06:45.840 
now I'm not going to include the little
pieces<00:06:44.440> because<00:06:45.040> they<00:06:45.250> could<00:06:45.460> be<00:06:45.580> a<00:06:45.610> choking

00:06:45.840 --> 00:06:45.850 
pieces because they could be a choking

00:06:45.850 --> 00:06:53.550 
pieces because they could be a choking
hazard<00:06:46.060> and<00:06:46.660> there<00:06:47.320> it<00:06:47.410> is
