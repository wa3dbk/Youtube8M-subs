00:03:21.360 --> 00:03:21.370 
to survive and build stuff you'd have to

00:03:21.370 --> 00:03:22.890 
to survive and build stuff you'd have to
create<00:03:21.610> more<00:03:21.910> enemies<00:03:22.360> and<00:03:22.570> make<00:03:22.690> them

00:03:22.890 --> 00:03:22.900 
create more enemies and make them

00:03:22.900 --> 00:03:24.630 
create more enemies and make them
tougher<00:03:23.260> but<00:03:23.560> it<00:03:23.680> would<00:03:23.769> totally<00:03:23.920> be<00:03:24.250> worth<00:03:24.280> it

00:03:24.630 --> 00:03:24.640 
tougher but it would totally be worth it

00:03:24.640 --> 00:03:27.180 
tougher but it would totally be worth it
with<00:03:25.150> the<00:03:25.269> 2d<00:03:25.630> pop-up<00:03:26.079> art<00:03:26.260> style<00:03:26.530> things<00:03:26.980> can

00:03:27.180 --> 00:03:27.190 
with the 2d pop-up art style things can

00:03:27.190 --> 00:03:28.860 
with the 2d pop-up art style things can
occasionally<00:03:27.459> be<00:03:27.820> hard<00:03:28.030> to<00:03:28.150> pick<00:03:28.329> up<00:03:28.480> but

00:03:28.860 --> 00:03:28.870 
occasionally be hard to pick up but

00:03:28.870 --> 00:03:30.780 
occasionally be hard to pick up but
luckily<00:03:29.110> you<00:03:29.380> can<00:03:29.500> turn<00:03:29.739> the<00:03:29.920> camera<00:03:30.280> and<00:03:30.370> look

00:03:30.780 --> 00:03:30.790 
luckily you can turn the camera and look

00:03:30.790 --> 00:03:32.430 
luckily you can turn the camera and look
behind<00:03:31.180> things<00:03:31.450> so<00:03:31.600> it's<00:03:31.720> not<00:03:31.870> that<00:03:32.170> much<00:03:32.380> of

00:03:32.430 --> 00:03:32.440 
behind things so it's not that much of

00:03:32.440 --> 00:03:34.440 
behind things so it's not that much of
an<00:03:32.650> annoyance<00:03:33.040> also<00:03:33.730> the<00:03:33.850> combat<00:03:34.209> in<00:03:34.329> this

00:03:34.440 --> 00:03:34.450 
an annoyance also the combat in this

00:03:34.450 --> 00:03:36.210 
an annoyance also the combat in this
game<00:03:34.690> is<00:03:34.840> a<00:03:34.870> bit<00:03:35.170> clunky<00:03:35.530> left-clicking

00:03:36.210 --> 00:03:36.220 
game is a bit clunky left-clicking

00:03:36.220 --> 00:03:38.160 
game is a bit clunky left-clicking
attacks<00:03:36.670> but<00:03:36.850> it<00:03:36.910> also<00:03:37.090> moves<00:03:37.510> so<00:03:37.750> if<00:03:37.810> you<00:03:37.930> miss

00:03:38.160 --> 00:03:38.170 
attacks but it also moves so if you miss

00:03:38.170 --> 00:03:39.930 
attacks but it also moves so if you miss
an<00:03:38.350> enemy<00:03:38.680> which<00:03:38.890> could<00:03:39.190> be<00:03:39.340> moving<00:03:39.549> and<00:03:39.760> easy

00:03:39.930 --> 00:03:39.940 
an enemy which could be moving and easy

00:03:39.940 --> 00:03:41.940 
an enemy which could be moving and easy
to<00:03:40.120> do<00:03:40.299> you<00:03:40.660> could<00:03:40.810> walk<00:03:41.049> right<00:03:41.350> into<00:03:41.530> him<00:03:41.769> and

00:03:41.940 --> 00:03:41.950 
to do you could walk right into him and

00:03:41.950 --> 00:03:43.740 
to do you could walk right into him and
not<00:03:42.280> really<00:03:42.579> attack<00:03:42.880> him<00:03:43.060> I'm<00:03:43.480> not<00:03:43.600> really

00:03:43.740 --> 00:03:43.750 
not really attack him I'm not really

00:03:43.750 --> 00:03:45.120 
not really attack him I'm not really
sure<00:03:43.959> how<00:03:44.079> they<00:03:44.200> would<00:03:44.290> go<00:03:44.440> about<00:03:44.470> fixing<00:03:44.859> this

00:03:45.120 --> 00:03:45.130 
sure how they would go about fixing this

00:03:45.130 --> 00:03:46.620 
sure how they would go about fixing this
one<00:03:45.519> thing<00:03:45.670> that<00:03:45.820> might<00:03:46.030> work<00:03:46.060> would<00:03:46.420> be<00:03:46.510> to

00:03:46.620 --> 00:03:46.630 
one thing that might work would be to

00:03:46.630 --> 00:03:48.390 
one thing that might work would be to
have<00:03:46.780> an<00:03:46.930> attack<00:03:47.230> ground<00:03:47.650> feature<00:03:48.010> like<00:03:48.280> they

00:03:48.390 --> 00:03:48.400 
have an attack ground feature like they

00:03:48.400 --> 00:03:50.099 
have an attack ground feature like they
do<00:03:48.459> in<00:03:48.640> StarCraft<00:03:49.150> where<00:03:49.690> your<00:03:49.810> character

00:03:50.099 --> 00:03:50.109 
do in StarCraft where your character

00:03:50.109 --> 00:03:51.780 
do in StarCraft where your character
would<00:03:50.260> attack<00:03:50.530> anything<00:03:50.890> between<00:03:51.160> him<00:03:51.549> and

00:03:51.780 --> 00:03:51.790 
would attack anything between him and

00:03:51.790 --> 00:03:53.310 
would attack anything between him and
the<00:03:51.880> point<00:03:52.180> you<00:03:52.299> moved<00:03:52.540> to<00:03:52.780> that<00:03:53.200> would

00:03:53.310 --> 00:03:53.320 
the point you moved to that would

00:03:53.320 --> 00:03:55.199 
the point you moved to that would
actually<00:03:53.620> be<00:03:53.769> super<00:03:54.070> helpful<00:03:54.220> also<00:03:54.970> I'd<00:03:55.090> like

when I'm not hurting them at all even a

00:04:03.549 --> 00:04:05.610 
when I'm not hurting them at all even a
Pokemon<00:04:04.000> style<00:04:04.329> it's<00:04:04.780> not<00:04:04.930> very<00:04:05.350> effective

00:04:05.610 --> 00:04:05.620 
Pokemon style it's not very effective

00:04:05.620 --> 00:04:06.599 
Pokemon style it's not very effective
would<00:04:05.950> be<00:04:06.100> helpful

00:04:06.599 --> 00:04:06.609 
would be helpful

00:04:06.609 --> 00:04:08.069 
would be helpful
I<00:04:06.640> tried<00:04:07.030> setting<00:04:07.239> this<00:04:07.420> tree<00:04:07.630> monster<00:04:07.959> on

00:04:08.069 --> 00:04:08.079 
I tried setting this tree monster on

00:04:08.079 --> 00:04:10.199 
I tried setting this tree monster on
fire<00:04:08.260> forever<00:04:08.680> with<00:04:08.920> no<00:04:08.950> real<00:04:09.430> effect<00:04:09.579> you

00:04:10.199 --> 00:04:10.209 
fire forever with no real effect you

00:04:10.209 --> 00:04:11.670 
fire forever with no real effect you
think<00:04:10.450> that<00:04:10.540> a<00:04:10.570> tree<00:04:10.900> would<00:04:11.049> be<00:04:11.109> vulnerable<00:04:11.410> to

00:04:11.670 --> 00:04:11.680 
think that a tree would be vulnerable to

00:04:11.680 --> 00:04:13.949 
think that a tree would be vulnerable to
fire<00:04:11.980> you<00:04:12.489> know<00:04:12.640> with<00:04:12.790> it<00:04:12.910> being<00:04:12.940> made<00:04:13.570> of<00:04:13.690> wood

00:04:13.949 --> 00:04:13.959 
fire you know with it being made of wood

00:04:13.959 --> 00:04:15.750 
fire you know with it being made of wood
and<00:04:14.140> all<00:04:14.260> hopefully<00:04:15.100> this<00:04:15.220> will<00:04:15.340> be<00:04:15.459> a<00:04:15.489> feature

00:04:15.750 --> 00:04:15.760 
and all hopefully this will be a feature

00:04:15.760 --> 00:04:17.909 
and all hopefully this will be a feature
in<00:04:16.030> the<00:04:16.120> final<00:04:16.479> game<00:04:16.690> now<00:04:17.140> obviously<00:04:17.620> I'm<00:04:17.799> not

00:04:17.909 --> 00:04:17.919 
in the final game now obviously I'm not

00:04:17.919 --> 00:04:19.590 
in the final game now obviously I'm not
going<00:04:18.100> to<00:04:18.250> rate<00:04:18.430> a<00:04:18.459> game<00:04:18.729> that<00:04:18.940> isn't<00:04:19.269> even<00:04:19.359> out

00:04:19.590 --> 00:04:19.600 
going to rate a game that isn't even out

00:04:19.600 --> 00:04:21.479 
going to rate a game that isn't even out
yet<00:04:19.780> but<00:04:19.989> I<00:04:20.019> will<00:04:20.169> say<00:04:20.530> that<00:04:20.709> don't<00:04:20.950> starve<00:04:21.280> has

00:04:21.479 --> 00:04:21.489 
yet but I will say that don't starve has

00:04:21.489 --> 00:04:22.950 
yet but I will say that don't starve has
the<00:04:21.609> potential<00:04:21.940> to<00:04:22.120> be<00:04:22.240> a<00:04:22.270> really<00:04:22.510> great<00:04:22.659> game

00:04:22.950 --> 00:04:22.960 
the potential to be a really great game

00:04:22.960 --> 00:04:24.779 
the potential to be a really great game
and<00:04:23.229> I<00:04:23.500> enjoyed<00:04:23.860> the<00:04:23.979> time<00:04:24.159> I<00:04:24.190> spent<00:04:24.520> playing
