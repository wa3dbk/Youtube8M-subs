00:01:12.050 --> 00:01:12.060 

00:01:12.060 --> 00:01:15.260 

first<00:01:12.660> we<00:01:12.840> take<00:01:13.050> a<00:01:13.410> bit<00:01:13.950> of<00:01:14.100> the<00:01:14.370> blue<00:01:14.700> tape

00:01:15.260 --> 00:01:15.270 
first we take a bit of the blue tape

00:01:15.270 --> 00:01:18.140 
first we take a bit of the blue tape
blue<00:01:15.990> flower<00:01:16.230> trip<00:01:16.560> got<00:01:17.340> a<00:01:17.400> piece<00:01:17.640> of<00:01:17.670> it<00:01:18.030> and

00:01:18.140 --> 00:01:18.150 
blue flower trip got a piece of it and

then<00:01:18.960> cut<00:01:19.410> it<00:01:19.530> in<00:01:19.650> the<00:01:19.770> center<00:01:20.450> horizontally

00:01:23.440 --> 00:01:23.450 
then cut it in the center horizontally

00:01:23.450 --> 00:01:29.660 
then cut it in the center horizontally
so<00:01:24.450> you<00:01:24.570> have<00:01:24.810> two<00:01:25.020> pieces<00:01:25.229> like<00:01:25.650> this

00:01:29.660 --> 00:01:29.670

00:03:22.870 --> 00:03:27.119 

take<00:03:23.380> another<00:03:23.680> petal<00:03:24.000> second<00:03:25.000> petal

00:03:27.119 --> 00:03:27.129 
take another petal second petal

00:03:27.129 --> 00:03:36.220 
take another petal second petal
throw<00:03:27.670> it<00:03:27.849> again

00:03:36.220 --> 00:03:36.230 

00:03:36.230 --> 00:03:41.559 

and<00:03:36.650> applied<00:03:37.069> stick<00:03:37.730> this<00:03:38.349> with<00:03:39.349> on<00:03:39.620> the<00:03:40.569> first

00:03:41.559 --> 00:03:41.569 
and applied stick this with on the first

00:03:41.569 --> 00:03:44.710 
and applied stick this with on the first
petite<00:03:41.930> overlapping<00:03:42.760> at<00:03:43.760> least<00:03:44.030> half<00:03:44.360> of<00:03:44.510> the

00:03:44.710 --> 00:03:44.720 
petite overlapping at least half of the

00:03:44.720 --> 00:03:48.330 
petite overlapping at least half of the
first<00:03:45.290> cracking

00:03:48.330 --> 00:03:48.340 

00:03:48.340 --> 00:03:50.170 

eggless

00:03:50.170 --> 00:03:50.180 
eggless

00:03:50.180 --> 00:03:53.020 
eggless
and<00:03:50.269> similarly<00:03:51.260> I<00:03:51.620> have<00:03:51.680> stuck<00:03:52.250> the<00:03:52.459> other<00:03:52.700> two

00:03:53.020 --> 00:03:53.030 
and similarly I have stuck the other two

00:03:53.030 --> 00:03:54.640 
and similarly I have stuck the other two
petals<00:03:53.269> so<00:03:53.540> we<00:03:53.659> have<00:03:53.750> four<00:03:53.959> petals<00:03:54.140> like<00:03:54.439> this

00:03:54.640 --> 00:03:54.650 
petals so we have four petals like this

00:03:54.650 --> 00:03:57.699 
petals so we have four petals like this
forming<00:03:55.549> a<00:03:55.700> flower<00:03:56.090> now<00:03:56.900> you<00:03:56.959> take<00:03:57.290> the<00:03:57.500> blue

00:03:57.699 --> 00:03:57.709 
forming a flower now you take the blue

00:03:57.709 --> 00:04:01.270 
forming a flower now you take the blue
tape<00:03:58.069> again<00:03:58.400> and<00:03:58.640> cut<00:03:59.150> about<00:03:59.390> two<00:04:00.019> inches<00:04:00.439> two

00:04:01.270 --> 00:04:01.280 
tape again and cut about two inches two

00:04:01.280 --> 00:04:08.290 
tape again and cut about two inches two
and<00:04:01.400> a<00:04:01.459> half<00:04:01.670> inches<00:04:01.970> long<00:04:02.030> strip<00:04:04.659> stretch<00:04:05.659> it
