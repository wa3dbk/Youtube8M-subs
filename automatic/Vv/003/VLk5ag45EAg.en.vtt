00:00:08.189 --> 00:00:14.170
 yes so for the sunshine office 

00:00:10.530 --> 00:00:15.710
 I take very like such a small 

00:00:14.170 --> 00:00:19.119
 mirror telescope 

00:00:15.710 --> 00:00:22.430
 mm focal length then fits the 

00:00:19.119 --> 00:00:25.119
 sun disk at least with the micro 

00:00:22.430 --> 00:00:29.660
 Four thirds camera is now the lume 

00:00:25.119 --> 00:00:33.980
 lumix g3 what the sunshade namely 

00:00:29.660 --> 00:00:35.600
 format filling the picture here can 

00:00:33.980 --> 00:00:39.170
 one does not zoom so far my soul 

00:00:35.600 --> 00:00:41.630
 Fixed focal length and what you need it 

00:00:39.170 --> 00:00:43.640
 then stop such a t2 adapter for 

00:00:41.630 --> 00:00:47.180
 micro four thirds with it the camera nevertheless 

00:00:43.640 --> 00:00:52.730
 fits exactly and very important 

00:00:47.180 --> 00:00:55.850
 is of course the sunscreen 

00:00:52.730 --> 00:00:57.649
 this is a special foil so you can 

00:00:55.850 --> 00:00:59.780
 do not take kitchen foils now because 

00:00:57.649 --> 00:01:01.059
 that looks like it or something like that 

00:00:59.780 --> 00:01:03.710
 life threatening 

00:01:01.059 --> 00:01:06.500
 looks through it or at least for the 

00:01:03.710 --> 00:01:11.270
 eyes perilous but that must 

00:01:06.500 --> 00:01:14.570
 to be a special sunscreen 

00:01:11.270 --> 00:01:17.900
 there is to buy in astronomy 

00:01:14.570 --> 00:01:21.710
 shops and you can do that yourself 

00:01:17.900 --> 00:01:24.259
 tinker the instructions I have in 

00:01:21.710 --> 00:01:26.869
 internet and you can go from the 

00:01:24.259 --> 00:01:27.860
 link so in the description you can 

00:01:26.869 --> 00:01:29.509
 look at you exactly 

00:01:27.860 --> 00:01:31.640
 I have the lume now I have several 

00:01:29.509 --> 00:01:34.040
 lumix cameras but i have these now 

00:01:31.640 --> 00:01:39.320
 taken because the one swiveling 

00:01:34.040 --> 00:01:41.540
 display has that is more comfortable there can 

00:01:39.320 --> 00:01:45.710
 me then because one should not be here 

00:01:41.540 --> 00:01:47.689
 by looking into the sun itself 

00:01:45.710 --> 00:01:50.990
 with foil so it is not recommended 

00:01:47.689 --> 00:01:53.930
 you should always take the liveview because 

00:01:50.990 --> 00:01:59.079
 it could be too irreparable as to 

00:01:53.930 --> 00:01:59.079
 cause permanent eye damage 

00:02:06.110 --> 00:02:12.380
 if you do not have such a telescope now 

00:02:09.840 --> 00:02:14.460
 you can also have the normal 

00:02:12.380 --> 00:02:18.150
 For example, take a SLR camera 

00:02:14.460 --> 00:02:20.460
 or another digital camera 

00:02:18.150 --> 00:02:24.540
 what matters is that we are ahead but 

00:02:20.460 --> 00:02:27.270
 filter before you tinker with the 

00:02:24.540 --> 00:02:28.770
 corresponding foil is great of course 

00:02:27.270 --> 00:02:31.680
 for my son then you can the 

00:02:28.770 --> 00:02:34.310
 bildausschnitt according to his 

00:02:31.680 --> 00:02:36.870
 want to customize 

00:02:34.310 --> 00:02:39.140
 Now it works with a camera too 

00:02:36.870 --> 00:02:39.140
 Naturally
