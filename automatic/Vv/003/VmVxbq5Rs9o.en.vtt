00:00:42.860 --> 00:00:42.870 
and I was able to customize the

00:00:42.870 --> 00:00:48.290 
and I was able to customize the
temperatures<00:00:43.589> for<00:00:44.039> this<00:00:46.460> the<00:00:47.460> secret<00:00:47.730> to

00:00:48.290 --> 00:00:48.300 
temperatures for this the secret to

00:00:48.300 --> 00:00:53.419 
temperatures for this the secret to
customizing<00:00:49.079> a<00:00:49.260> temperature<00:00:49.739> is<00:00:50.480> you<00:00:52.429> first

00:00:53.419 --> 00:00:53.429 
customizing a temperature is you first

00:00:53.429 --> 00:00:56.360 
customizing a temperature is you first
you<00:00:53.670> unlock<00:00:54.300> the<00:00:54.449> screen<00:00:54.739> then<00:00:55.739> you<00:00:56.159> go<00:00:56.339> over

00:00:56.360 --> 00:00:56.370 
you unlock the screen then you go over

00:00:56.370 --> 00:01:02.360 
you unlock the screen then you go over
here<00:00:56.940> and<00:00:58.760> then<00:00:59.760> you<00:01:00.690> hold<00:01:01.499> down<00:01:01.859> the

00:01:02.360 --> 00:01:02.370 
here and then you hold down the

00:01:02.370 --> 00:01:06.650 
here and then you hold down the
temperature<00:01:03.380> until<00:01:04.380> it<00:01:05.100> beeps<00:01:05.370> and<00:01:05.760> note<00:01:06.420> that

00:01:06.650 --> 00:01:06.660 
temperature until it beeps and note that

00:01:06.660 --> 00:01:10.940 
temperature until it beeps and note that
it's<00:01:06.780> flashing<00:01:07.140> and<00:01:08.660> then<00:01:09.660> use<00:01:10.170> the<00:01:10.380> plus<00:01:10.680> or

00:01:10.940 --> 00:01:10.950 
it's flashing and then use the plus or

00:01:10.950 --> 00:01:19.490 
it's flashing and then use the plus or
minus<00:01:11.430> symbols<00:01:12.000> to<00:01:12.300> change<00:01:12.840> it

00:01:19.490 --> 00:01:19.500 

00:01:19.500 --> 00:01:21.380 

and<00:01:20.010> then<00:01:20.310> boom<00:01:20.550> that's<00:01:21.000> how<00:01:21.120> you<00:01:21.150> do<00:01:21.360> it

00:01:21.380 --> 00:01:21.390 
and then boom that's how you do it

00:01:21.390 --> 00:01:23.690 
and then boom that's how you do it
anyways<00:01:22.200> to<00:01:22.620> the<00:01:22.740> fans<00:01:22.980> right<00:01:23.310> now<00:01:23.460> they're<00:01:23.610> at

00:01:23.690 --> 00:01:23.700 
anyways to the fans right now they're at

00:01:23.700 --> 00:01:25.730 
anyways to the fans right now they're at
their<00:01:23.940> minimum<00:01:24.300> speed<00:01:25.020> so<00:01:25.290> what<00:01:25.440> you<00:01:25.560> do<00:01:25.710> is

00:01:25.730 --> 00:01:25.740 
their minimum speed so what you do is

00:01:25.740 --> 00:01:28.160 
their minimum speed so what you do is
you<00:01:25.950> hit<00:01:26.190> the<00:01:26.340> number<00:01:26.670> right<00:01:27.030> here<00:01:27.090> and<00:01:27.510> then

00:01:28.160 --> 00:01:28.170 
you hit the number right here and then

00:01:28.170 --> 00:01:31.990 
you hit the number right here and then
you<00:01:28.440> add<00:01:28.680> our<00:01:29.250> hit<00:01:30.140> fan<00:01:31.140> number<00:01:31.440> one<00:01:31.650> is<00:01:31.860> the

00:01:31.990 --> 00:01:32.000 
you add our hit fan number one is the

00:01:32.000 --> 00:01:34.790 
you add our hit fan number one is the
built-in<00:01:33.000> fan<00:01:33.330> that<00:01:33.570> came<00:01:34.110> with<00:01:34.410> this

00:01:34.790 --> 00:01:34.800 
built-in fan that came with this

00:01:34.800 --> 00:01:41.150 
built-in fan that came with this
computer<00:01:35.220> case<00:01:35.580> and<00:01:39.380> its<00:01:40.380> maximum<00:01:41.010> is

00:01:41.150 --> 00:01:41.160 
computer case and its maximum is

00:01:41.160 --> 00:01:45.650 
computer case and its maximum is
approximately<00:01:42.090> 1100<00:01:43.729> so<00:01:44.729> let<00:01:44.880> me<00:01:45.000> just<00:01:45.210> adjust

00:01:45.650 --> 00:01:45.660 
approximately 1100 so let me just adjust

00:01:45.660 --> 00:01:57.570 
approximately 1100 so let me just adjust
all<00:01:46.590> these

00:01:57.570 --> 00:01:57.580 

00:01:57.580 --> 00:02:01.080 

and<00:01:58.500> this<00:01:59.500> little<00:01:59.920> thing<00:02:00.430> right<00:02:00.460> here<00:02:00.670> that's

00:02:19.050 --> 00:02:19.060 
correctly and here you can do celsius or

00:02:19.060 --> 00:02:24.260 
correctly and here you can do celsius or
fahrenheit<00:02:19.150> with<00:02:19.960> a<00:02:20.020> fan<00:02:20.260> controller<00:02:20.740> see<00:02:21.190> I

00:02:24.260 --> 00:02:24.270 

00:02:24.270 --> 00:02:31.080

00:02:31.080 --> 00:02:31.090 
like it on Fahrenheit you got CP vga HD

00:02:31.090 --> 00:02:34.230 
like it on Fahrenheit you got CP vga HD
and<00:02:31.330> system<00:02:31.930> what<00:02:32.620> I<00:02:32.650> did<00:02:32.920> for<00:02:33.070> system<00:02:33.610> was<00:02:33.910> I

00:02:34.230 --> 00:02:34.240 
and system what I did for system was I

00:02:34.240 --> 00:02:37.350 
and system what I did for system was I
put<00:02:35.200> it<00:02:35.320> on<00:02:35.440> the<00:02:35.620> power<00:02:35.860> supply<00:02:36.160> because<00:02:37.060> it's

00:02:37.350 --> 00:02:37.360 
put it on the power supply because it's

00:02:37.360 --> 00:02:40.590 
put it on the power supply because it's
powered<00:02:37.630> by<00:02:37.720> it<00:02:38.140> powers<00:02:38.800> the<00:02:38.830> system<00:02:39.550> if<00:02:39.790> you

00:02:40.590 --> 00:02:40.600 
powered by it powers the system if you

00:02:40.600 --> 00:02:44.510 
powered by it powers the system if you
know<00:02:40.780> where<00:02:40.959> you<00:02:41.110> put<00:02:41.140> your<00:02:41.430> system<00:02:43.050> pen

00:02:48.720 --> 00:02:48.730 
system sticker who can come below where

00:02:48.730 --> 00:02:55.050 
system sticker who can come below where
you<00:02:48.760> would<00:02:49.360> recommend<00:02:49.840> putting<00:02:50.050> it<00:02:50.320> and<00:02:54.060> after

automatically locks out in like
approximately<00:03:06.430> 30<00:03:06.730> seconds<00:03:08.250> so<00:03:09.250> anyways

00:03:09.960 --> 00:03:09.970 
approximately 30 seconds so anyways
