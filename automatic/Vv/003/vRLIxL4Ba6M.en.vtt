fixed<00:02:54.170> after<00:02:54.440> that<00:02:55.060> so<00:02:56.060> I<00:02:56.120> don't<00:02:56.270> know<00:02:56.330> what's

00:02:56.500 --> 00:02:56.510 
fixed after that so I don't know what's

00:02:56.510 --> 00:02:58.570 
fixed after that so I don't know what's
up<00:02:56.570> with<00:02:56.750> that<00:02:56.800> but<00:02:57.800> I<00:02:57.890> just<00:02:58.070> wanted<00:02:58.280> people<00:02:58.370> to

00:02:58.570 --> 00:02:58.580 
up with that but I just wanted people to

00:02:58.580 --> 00:03:02.070 
up with that but I just wanted people to
know<00:02:58.820> or<00:02:59.510> at<00:02:59.930> least<00:03:00.080> for<00:03:00.320> for<00:03:01.220> the<00:03:01.310> hero3<00:03:01.610> is

00:03:02.070 --> 00:03:02.080 
know or at least for for the hero3 is

00:03:02.080 --> 00:03:05.530 
know or at least for for the hero3 is
that<00:03:03.080> it's<00:03:03.290> not<00:03:03.620> protune<00:03:04.430> proteins<00:03:05.240> not<00:03:05.390> the

00:03:05.530 --> 00:03:05.540 
that it's not protune proteins not the

00:03:05.540 --> 00:03:08.680 
that it's not protune proteins not the
problem

00:03:08.680 --> 00:03:08.690 

00:03:08.690 --> 00:03:11.890 

it<00:03:09.200> might<00:03:09.440> be<00:03:09.650> some<00:03:10.520> other<00:03:10.870> firmware<00:03:11.870> that

00:03:11.890 --> 00:03:11.900 
it might be some other firmware that

00:03:11.900 --> 00:03:13.980 
it might be some other firmware that
came<00:03:12.440> with<00:03:12.680> protune

00:03:13.980 --> 00:03:13.990 
came with protune

00:03:13.990 --> 00:03:15.900 
came with protune
or<00:03:14.350> you<00:03:14.800> know<00:03:14.890> that<00:03:15.100> update<00:03:15.340> that<00:03:15.520> Pro<00:03:15.670> Tunes

the<00:03:20.410> same<00:03:20.620> problem<00:03:21.070> as<00:03:21.910> people<00:03:22.120> who<00:03:22.720> are

00:03:22.740 --> 00:03:22.750 
the same problem as people who are

00:03:22.750 --> 00:03:26.640 
the same problem as people who are

I<00:05:05.780> had<00:05:06.590> a<00:05:06.620> question<00:05:07.600> for<00:05:08.600> you<00:05:09.470> guys<00:05:09.530> that<00:05:09.950> mount

00:05:10.150 --> 00:05:10.160 
I had a question for you guys that mount

00:05:10.160 --> 00:05:14.980 
I had a question for you guys that mount
your<00:05:10.370> cameras<00:05:10.910> on<00:05:11.840> the<00:05:12.650> side<00:05:13.630> on<00:05:14.630> the<00:05:14.690> side<00:05:14.780> of

00:05:14.980 --> 00:05:14.990 
your cameras on the side on the side of

00:05:14.990 --> 00:05:17.960 
your cameras on the side on the side of
your<00:05:15.200> helmet

00:05:17.960 --> 00:05:17.970 

00:05:17.970 --> 00:05:19.700 

because<00:05:18.480> I<00:05:18.540> have<00:05:18.690> this<00:05:18.870> problem<00:05:19.140> when<00:05:19.470> I'm<00:05:19.560> on

00:05:19.700 --> 00:05:19.710 
because I have this problem when I'm on

00:05:19.710 --> 00:05:23.600 
because I have this problem when I'm on
the<00:05:19.800> freeway<00:05:20.630> if<00:05:21.630> I'm<00:05:21.900> going<00:05:22.320> like<00:05:23.160> over<00:05:23.520> the

00:05:23.600 --> 00:05:23.610 
the freeway if I'm going like over the

00:05:23.610 --> 00:05:29.380 
the freeway if I'm going like over the
speed<00:05:23.820> limit<00:05:24.020> I<00:05:27.500> guess<00:05:28.500> like<00:05:28.740> the<00:05:28.980> wind

00:05:29.380 --> 00:05:29.390 
speed limit I guess like the wind

00:05:29.390 --> 00:05:32.090 
speed limit I guess like the wind
because<00:05:30.390> mine<00:05:30.600> is<00:05:31.050> mounted<00:05:31.530> on<00:05:31.650> top<00:05:31.860> of<00:05:31.890> my

00:05:32.090 --> 00:05:32.100 
because mine is mounted on top of my

00:05:32.100 --> 00:05:36.290 
because mine is mounted on top of my
helmet<00:05:33.080> the<00:05:34.080> wind<00:05:34.380> kind<00:05:34.860> of<00:05:35.070> wants<00:05:35.970> to<00:05:36.090> like

00:05:36.290 --> 00:05:36.300 
helmet the wind kind of wants to like

00:05:36.300 --> 00:05:38.990 
helmet the wind kind of wants to like
pull<00:05:36.540> my<00:05:36.570> helmet<00:05:37.110> back<00:05:37.380> so<00:05:38.220> it<00:05:38.370> makes<00:05:38.580> the<00:05:38.730> chin

00:05:38.990 --> 00:05:39.000 
pull my helmet back so it makes the chin

00:05:39.000 --> 00:05:41.690 
pull my helmet back so it makes the chin
go<00:05:39.270> like<00:05:39.450> up<00:05:39.800> even<00:05:40.800> when<00:05:40.950> it's<00:05:41.070> strapped<00:05:41.400> all

00:05:41.690 --> 00:05:41.700 
go like up even when it's strapped all

00:05:41.700 --> 00:05:42.560 
go like up even when it's strapped all
the<00:05:41.970> way<00:05:42.060> tight

00:05:42.560 --> 00:05:42.570 
the way tight
