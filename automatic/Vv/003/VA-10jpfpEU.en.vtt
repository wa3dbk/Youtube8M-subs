00:00:22.630 --> 00:00:29.450 
JD 7 training routine during a caloric
surplus<00:00:22.810> should<00:00:23.500> it<00:00:23.619> differ<00:00:23.920> and<00:00:24.310> if<00:00:24.910> so<00:00:25.240> how

ok so in reality your training routine

00:00:37.140 --> 00:00:39.990 
ok so in reality your training routine
should<00:00:38.140> not<00:00:38.380> change<00:00:38.829> whether<00:00:39.310> you're<00:00:39.579> cutting

00:00:39.990 --> 00:00:40.000

want your main goal is to maintain
fullness<00:00:46.989> maintain<00:00:47.530> strength<00:00:47.890> while<00:00:48.730> you're

00:00:48.930 --> 00:00:48.940 
fullness maintain strength while you're

00:00:48.940 --> 00:00:52.439 
fullness maintain strength while you're
in<00:00:49.000> that<00:00:49.090> color<00:00:49.300> deficit<00:00:49.899> and<00:00:50.940> the<00:00:51.940> way<00:00:52.090> you<00:00:52.149> do

00:00:52.439 --> 00:00:52.449 
in that color deficit and the way you do

00:00:52.449 --> 00:00:55.549 
in that color deficit and the way you do
that<00:00:52.690> is<00:00:52.899> to<00:00:53.519> lift<00:00:54.519> as<00:00:54.699> heavy<00:00:54.910> as<00:00:55.059> possible

00:00:55.549 --> 00:00:55.559 
that is to lift as heavy as possible

00:00:55.559 --> 00:00:58.229 
that is to lift as heavy as possible
keep<00:00:56.559> lifting<00:00:56.800> the<00:00:57.760> amount<00:00:57.969> of<00:00:58.030> weight<00:00:58.210> that

00:00:58.229 --> 00:00:58.239 
keep lifting the amount of weight that

00:00:58.239 --> 00:01:01.229 
keep lifting the amount of weight that
you<00:00:58.629> are<00:00:58.899> doing<00:00:59.559> even<00:01:00.399> when<00:01:00.579> you're<00:01:00.760> in<00:01:01.000> a

you are doing even when you're in a
maintenance<00:01:01.780> or<00:01:02.140> a<00:01:02.250> surplus<00:01:03.250> a<00:01:03.309> bulk<00:01:04.470> ok<00:01:05.470> so

00:01:14.210 --> 00:01:14.220 

00:01:14.220 --> 00:01:16.580 

it<00:01:14.790> shouldn't<00:01:15.330> change<00:01:15.390> much<00:01:15.930> from<00:01:15.960> cutting

00:01:16.580 --> 00:01:16.590 
it shouldn't change much from cutting

00:01:16.590 --> 00:01:18.230 
it shouldn't change much from cutting
bulking<00:01:17.100> your<00:01:17.370> main<00:01:17.520> goal<00:01:17.730> is<00:01:17.820> to<00:01:17.940> keep<00:01:18.060> the

00:01:18.230 --> 00:01:18.240 
bulking your main goal is to keep the

00:01:18.240 --> 00:01:21.050 
bulking your main goal is to keep the
size<00:01:18.450> keep<00:01:18.870> the<00:01:19.020> muscle<00:01:19.410> keep<00:01:20.160> your<00:01:20.700> strength

00:01:21.050 --> 00:01:21.060 
size keep the muscle keep your strength

00:01:21.060 --> 00:01:23.450 
size keep the muscle keep your strength
while<00:01:21.510> you're<00:01:21.630> cutting<00:01:21.810> okay<00:01:22.530> while<00:01:23.310> you're

00:01:23.450 --> 00:01:23.460 
while you're cutting okay while you're

00:01:23.460 --> 00:01:25.910 
while you're cutting okay while you're
bulking<00:01:23.700> you're<00:01:24.090> trying<00:01:24.330> to<00:01:24.390> gain<00:01:24.570> as<00:01:24.920> much

00:01:25.910 --> 00:01:25.920 
bulking you're trying to gain as much

00:01:25.920 --> 00:01:29.780 
bulking you're trying to gain as much
muscle<00:01:26.220> and<00:01:26.610> strength<00:01:26.760> as<00:01:27.120> you<00:01:27.420> can<00:01:28.580> the<00:01:29.580> one

00:01:29.780 --> 00:01:29.790 
muscle and strength as you can the one

00:01:29.790 --> 00:01:34.910 
muscle and strength as you can the one
thing<00:01:30.000> that<00:01:30.030> can<00:01:30.630> change<00:01:30.930> is<00:01:32.300> volume<00:01:33.920> volume

00:01:34.910 --> 00:01:34.920 
thing that can change is volume volume

00:01:34.920 --> 00:01:39.460 
thing that can change is volume volume
and<00:01:35.250> frequency<00:01:35.480> and<00:01:36.920> I<00:01:37.920> say<00:01:38.520> that<00:01:38.790> because

00:01:39.460 --> 00:01:39.470 
and frequency and I say that because

00:01:39.470 --> 00:01:43.160 
and frequency and I say that because
while<00:01:40.470> you're<00:01:40.680> in<00:01:40.830> a<00:01:40.920> clerk<00:01:41.220> surplus<00:01:42.170> your

00:01:43.160 --> 00:01:43.170 
while you're in a clerk surplus your

00:01:43.170 --> 00:01:46.150 
while you're in a clerk surplus your
recovery<00:01:43.590> is<00:01:44.040> going<00:01:44.280> to<00:01:44.400> be<00:01:44.490> much<00:01:44.730> better

00:01:46.150 --> 00:01:46.160 
recovery is going to be much better

00:01:46.160 --> 00:01:49.910 
recovery is going to be much better
after<00:01:47.160> training<00:01:48.050> so<00:01:49.050> you<00:01:49.140> can<00:01:49.440> add<00:01:49.619> more

00:01:49.910 --> 00:01:49.920 
after training so you can add more

00:01:49.920 --> 00:01:53.600 
after training so you can add more
frequency<00:01:50.640> meaning<00:01:51.600> how<00:01:52.170> often<00:01:52.710> you<00:01:52.979> train

00:01:53.600 --> 00:01:53.610 
frequency meaning how often you train

00:01:53.610 --> 00:01:55.940 
frequency meaning how often you train
your<00:01:53.760> muscle<00:01:54.060> groups<00:01:54.210> per<00:01:54.450> week<00:01:54.630> and<00:01:54.869> you<00:01:55.800> can

00:01:55.940 --> 00:01:55.950 
your muscle groups per week and you can

00:01:55.950 --> 00:01:58.010 
your muscle groups per week and you can
add<00:01:56.130> more<00:01:56.310> volume<00:01:56.550> meaning<00:01:57.210> more<00:01:57.390> sets<00:01:57.780> or

00:01:58.010 --> 00:01:58.020 
add more volume meaning more sets or

00:01:58.020 --> 00:02:01.460 
add more volume meaning more sets or
more<00:01:58.200> reps<00:01:58.500> as<00:01:59.180> your<00:02:00.180> surplus<00:02:00.540> while<00:02:01.290> you're

00:02:01.460 --> 00:02:01.470 
more reps as your surplus while you're

00:02:01.470 --> 00:02:04.550 
more reps as your surplus while you're
in<00:02:01.530> a<00:02:01.619> surplus<00:02:02.060> because<00:02:03.060> again<00:02:03.780> you<00:02:04.140> your<00:02:04.350> body

00:02:04.550 --> 00:02:04.560 
in a surplus because again you your body

00:02:04.560 --> 00:02:07.490 
in a surplus because again you your body
will<00:02:04.800> recover<00:02:05.100> and<00:02:05.369> repair<00:02:06.020> at<00:02:07.020> a<00:02:07.080> better<00:02:07.380> rate

00:02:07.490 --> 00:02:07.500 
will recover and repair at a better rate

00:02:07.500 --> 00:02:10.400 
will recover and repair at a better rate
at<00:02:07.950> a<00:02:08.009> better<00:02:08.310> pace<00:02:08.640> more<00:02:09.240> efficient<00:02:09.750> than<00:02:10.080> if

00:02:10.400 --> 00:02:10.410 
at a better pace more efficient than if

00:02:10.410 --> 00:02:13.550 
at a better pace more efficient than if
you're<00:02:10.649> in<00:02:10.740> a<00:02:10.800> deficit<00:02:11.570> okay<00:02:12.570> to<00:02:12.630> sit<00:02:12.930> so<00:02:13.230> to

00:02:13.550 --> 00:02:13.560 
you're in a deficit okay to sit so to

00:02:13.560 --> 00:02:15.470 
you're in a deficit okay to sit so to
answer<00:02:13.709> your<00:02:13.860> question<00:02:14.330> nothing<00:02:15.330> should

00:02:15.470 --> 00:02:15.480 
answer your question nothing should

answer your question nothing should
change<00:02:15.540> but<00:02:16.110> you<00:02:16.200> can<00:02:16.440> add<00:02:16.770> more<00:02:17.040> frequency

00:02:17.630 --> 00:02:17.640 
change but you can add more frequency

00:02:17.640 --> 00:02:19.970 
change but you can add more frequency
and<00:02:17.850> more<00:02:18.390> volume<00:02:18.780> to<00:02:18.810> your<00:02:18.959> training<00:02:19.410> while

00:02:19.970 --> 00:02:19.980 
and more volume to your training while

00:02:19.980 --> 00:02:23.360 
and more volume to your training while
in<00:02:20.160> a<00:02:20.220> caloric<00:02:20.550> surplus<00:02:21.950> alright<00:02:22.950> so<00:02:23.220> I<00:02:23.250> hope

00:02:23.360 --> 00:02:23.370 
in a caloric surplus alright so I hope

00:02:23.370 --> 00:02:27.460 
in a caloric surplus alright so I hope
that<00:02:23.700> helped<00:02:24.030> and<00:02:25.070> thank<00:02:26.070> you<00:02:26.130> for<00:02:26.370> watching
