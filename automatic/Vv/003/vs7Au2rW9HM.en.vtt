 here you have such a window here 

00:01:44.910 --> 00:01:49.850
 the camcorder will be turned on or through

 you can see your smartphone 

00:01:49.850 --> 00:01:55.230
 satellite dish for starters here you are 

00:01:53.550 --> 00:01:57.240
 already secured his plate 

00:01:55.230 --> 00:02:03.870
 you just have to catch the signal and 

00:01:57.240 --> 00:02:05.750
 secure take your phone and here 

00:02:03.870 --> 00:02:08.910
 see arrow 

00:02:05.750 --> 00:02:10.560
 direct arrow on the rack 

00:02:08.910 --> 00:02:13.340
 which is attached 

00:02:10.560 --> 00:02:20.390
 satellite dish head and 

00:02:13.340 --> 00:02:24.630
 we turn now that it is necessary that. 

00:02:20.390 --> 00:02:28.590
 agreed with this circle of doctors 

00:02:24.630 --> 00:02:32.330
 we turn who defines the place and 

00:02:28.590 --> 00:02:32.330
 is the satellite there 

00:02:35.950 --> 00:02:38.700
 we turn 

00:02:41.490 --> 00:02:49.460
 that's how it came together how it baked 

00:02:44.730 --> 00:02:49.460
 means the satellite is on the side 

00:02:50.150 --> 00:03:01.010
 and that's exactly why arrows arrows 

00:02:57.140 --> 00:03:03.370
 we expose a rack which fasten 

00:03:01.010 --> 00:03:05.829
 hungry 

00:03:03.370 --> 00:03:10.489
 put the rack itself 

00:03:05.829 --> 00:03:11.000
 here this arrow and now we begin 

00:03:10.489 --> 00:03:13.459
 catch 

00:03:11.000 --> 00:03:16.400
 slightly tightened the bolts to the right to the left 

00:03:13.459 --> 00:03:19.760
 not gone u begin top top 

00:03:16.400 --> 00:03:31.639
 loosen up for this raise your 

00:03:19.760 --> 00:03:33.079
 a phone without you will appear like this 

00:03:31.639 --> 00:03:37.810
 need something also 

00:03:33.079 --> 00:03:37.810
 the cross crossed the circle 

00:03:44.910 --> 00:03:50.319
 that's as soon as he came together means this 

00:03:46.890 --> 00:03:53.049
 the location is a satellite 

00:03:50.319 --> 00:03:54.430
 to adjust the head as accurately as possible 

00:03:53.049 --> 00:03:59.560
 using the phone 

00:03:54.430 --> 00:04:03.060
 the phone itself we bring the heads together with 

00:03:59.560 --> 00:04:06.870
 phone raise the plate and then 

00:04:03.060 --> 00:04:12.040
 almost perfect can be customized 

00:04:06.870 --> 00:04:14.260
 the signal will come out only of course not 

00:04:12.040 --> 00:04:19.320
 always turns 100 percent out 

00:04:14.260 --> 00:04:19.320
 a signal he did it a couple of times for sure 

00:04:19.380 --> 00:04:24.639
 the program is not bad 

00:04:21.579 --> 00:04:26.340
 and show more than once convinced but 

00:04:24.639 --> 00:04:30.539
 almost perfect yes sure 

00:04:26.340 --> 00:04:32.970
 the only thing that accounts for a little more 

00:04:30.539 --> 00:04:36.340
 using the tuner and TV 

00:04:32.970 --> 00:04:38.860
 adjust the signal because a hundred 

00:04:36.340 --> 00:04:41.710
 percent until you drink with this 

00:04:38.860 --> 00:04:45.610
 programs have a little bit 

00:04:41.710 --> 00:04:50.490
 adjust as well as the program is good and 

00:04:45.610 --> 00:04:52.479
 show if all your gps is exposed 

00:04:50.490 --> 00:04:55.860
 almost perfectly accurate 

00:04:52.479 --> 00:04:55.860
 satellite location 

00:04:56.430 --> 00:05:02.440
 let's say who has no one just needs 

00:04:59.860 --> 00:05:09.940
 a little tinker plate can 

00:05:02.440 --> 00:05:12.730
 bail out so use hope she 

00:05:09.940 --> 00:05:14.850
