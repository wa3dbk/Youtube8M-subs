00:00:05.330 --> 00:00:07.690
 on 

00:00:07.690 --> 00:00:10.690
 the us commitment not withdrawn 

00:00:11.679 --> 00:00:14.929
 today in the Ticino CarriÃ¨re part 

00:00:14.929 --> 00:00:17.329
 long slide must be ruthlessly searched 

00:00:17.329 --> 00:00:20.779
 but to receive again looks 27 percent complete 

00:00:23.109 --> 00:00:24.869
 I have a little bit 

00:00:24.869 --> 00:00:27.169
 gezockt 

00:00:27.169 --> 00:00:29.960
 the feet to his 

00:00:29.960 --> 00:00:32.770
 her crazy Petrom cars 

00:00:32.770 --> 00:00:35.770
 Judicial found good by them 

00:00:38.260 --> 00:00:41.260
 I would say European special 

00:00:42.680 --> 00:00:45.680
 European top as Christian DuPont 

00:00:46.360 --> 00:00:49.840
 More everyone knows what is meant 

00:00:49.840 --> 00:00:51.870
 it is nice 

00:00:51.870 --> 00:00:55.150
 really last in Germany 

00:00:55.150 --> 00:00:56.950
 because the track is 

00:00:56.950 --> 00:00:58.220
 known 

00:00:58.220 --> 00:01:01.220
 through close to the big number 

00:01:03.140 --> 00:01:06.600
 the Nordschleife 

00:01:06.600 --> 00:01:08.350
 and that's in the series 

00:01:08.350 --> 00:01:10.610
 of empty parts of NÃ¼rburgring 

00:01:10.610 --> 00:01:13.110
 the reason the route 

00:01:13.110 --> 00:01:16.110
 the abbreviated version of it 

00:01:16.670 --> 00:01:19.670
 these three routes are driven 

00:01:20.540 --> 00:01:23.770
 All three of you are warm 

00:01:23.770 --> 00:01:26.490
 Let's start with the small piece 

00:01:26.490 --> 00:01:29.679
 around driven skyline gt-r 32 

00:01:30.300 --> 00:01:31.930
 as I said retro 

00:01:31.930 --> 00:01:34.930
 you can only take her dead 

00:01:35.980 --> 00:01:38.980
 even not rebuilt becomes the Federal President 

00:01:39.500 --> 00:01:41.240
 July Mo 

00:01:41.240 --> 00:01:44.240
 Game states at the dining table goes forward 

00:01:47.870 --> 00:01:50.960
 Taken to you by the Voice in the Hands 

00:01:50.960 --> 00:01:52.320
 some 

00:01:52.320 --> 00:01:55.320
 said my camera angle was "not so nice" 

00:01:59.910 --> 00:02:02.910
 that's not mine, it can not run in it 

00:02:03.470 --> 00:02:05.680
 she breaks 

00:02:05.680 --> 00:02:08.680
 do not be afraid 

00:02:09.819 --> 00:02:12.819
 too big 

00:02:14.659 --> 00:02:17.659
 stories 

00:02:22.289 --> 00:02:25.289
 Next 

00:02:39.299 --> 00:02:42.409
 they are for the youth 

00:02:42.409 --> 00:02:45.409
 Publication to be examined 

00:02:54.749 --> 00:02:57.749
 I can not come too 

00:02:58.699 --> 00:03:01.269
 at least not yet existent in this form 

00:03:01.269 --> 00:03:03.659
 he did not just complain 

00:03:03.659 --> 00:03:06.659
 Meanwhile, it is annoying 

00:03:07.179 --> 00:03:10.179
 Elsner and consolation 

00:03:14.069 --> 00:03:16.379
 was examined and 12 

00:03:16.379 --> 00:03:19.379
 SV Motion 

00:03:31.839 --> 00:03:33.109
 Dekker given 

00:03:33.109 --> 00:03:36.259
 which also brings up at a higher level 

00:03:36.259 --> 00:03:39.259
 I forgive for easy 

00:03:43.149 --> 00:03:46.149
 Stephan Roth si Giuseppe too heavy 

00:03:48.919 --> 00:03:51.919
 here you just have to go in and turn 

00:03:55.289 --> 00:03:58.289
 Wolfsburg 

00:04:02.389 --> 00:04:03.519
 where it still is 

00:04:03.519 --> 00:04:06.519
 Testers advise 

00:04:09.249 --> 00:04:12.249
 can 

00:04:14.179 --> 00:04:17.179
 7 

00:04:21.209 --> 00:04:24.209
 could to celebrate 

00:04:30.349 --> 00:04:33.349
 but get away so bad 

00:04:42.639 --> 00:04:45.639
 to 27 

00:05:08.580 --> 00:05:11.580
 now are diverse 

00:05:20.779 --> 00:05:23.779
 they were afraid 

00:05:28.770 --> 00:05:31.770
 replace them 

00:05:33.180 --> 00:05:36.180
 with 15 points 

00:05:36.770 --> 00:05:39.770
 if cameras can only win 

00:05:48.059 --> 00:05:51.059
 Can you test us I like 

00:05:51.819 --> 00:05:54.819
 Muenster one to 10 

00:06:07.550 --> 00:06:11.310
 now the AK 

00:06:12.839 --> 00:06:14.639
 the signs stand 

00:06:14.639 --> 00:06:17.979
 Maybe that was very exhausting 

00:06:17.979 --> 00:06:19.819
 I do not 

00:06:19.819 --> 00:06:22.659
 I thank you again that I do not like to come true 

00:06:22.659 --> 00:06:25.659
 in the middle of 7 

00:06:30.159 --> 00:06:33.589
 than the first part of this goal applies 

00:06:33.589 --> 00:06:36.430
 It is important to us not to look behind 

00:06:36.430 --> 00:06:39.150
 otherwise not for too long 

00:06:39.150 --> 00:06:41.409
 that 1 1 would remain in office 

00:06:41.409 --> 00:06:43.729
 because of that 

00:06:43.729 --> 00:06:44.569
 this is yet
