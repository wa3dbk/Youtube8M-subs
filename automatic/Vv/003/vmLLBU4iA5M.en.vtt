00:00:03.290 --> 00:00:07.859
 hello everyone is steven and today 

00:00:06.540 --> 00:00:10.740
 I present you a new cydia tweak 

00:00:07.859 --> 00:00:12.210
 who's called and who will go and who will edit 

00:00:10.740 --> 00:00:13.889
 the appearance of your screen from 

00:00:12.210 --> 00:00:15.480
 locking as well as its use 

00:00:13.889 --> 00:00:17.430
 you see that it's a lot more 

00:00:15.480 --> 00:00:19.680
 transparent including the bottom behind 

00:00:17.430 --> 00:00:20.940
 the clock and the date of the day next 

00:00:19.680 --> 00:00:22.500
 all the way down you always have right 

00:00:20.940 --> 00:00:24.720
 the shortcut for the camera 

00:00:22.500 --> 00:00:26.430
 that does not change the bar 

00:00:24.720 --> 00:00:28.110
 Unlocking and transparent 

00:00:26.430 --> 00:00:29.580
 so here firstly you have 

00:00:28.110 --> 00:00:31.050
 some small changes at the level 

00:00:29.580 --> 00:00:33.089
 design on the lockscreen 

00:00:31.050 --> 00:00:34.320
 but the big novelty of this tweak 

00:00:33.089 --> 00:00:35.190
 they relate to the center of 

00:00:34.320 --> 00:00:37.199
 notifications 

00:00:35.190 --> 00:00:38.999
 you know usually you have access to it 

00:00:37.199 --> 00:00:40.769
 since the springboard is there 

00:00:38.999 --> 00:00:43.739
 look here at you have a little 

00:00:40.769 --> 00:00:45.149
 drawer the same as under ios 7 and you 

00:00:43.739 --> 00:00:47.219
 are going to have thanks to him access to your 

00:00:45.149 --> 00:00:49.050
 notification center on the 

00:00:47.219 --> 00:00:50.579
 lockscreen lock screen 

00:00:49.050 --> 00:00:52.859
 so it's really something 

00:00:50.579 --> 00:00:54.600
 extremely practical at all times 

00:00:52.859 --> 00:00:56.039
 you can get off your center of 

00:00:54.600 --> 00:00:57.390
 notifications from the top of the 

00:00:56.039 --> 00:00:58.949
 lockscreen with inside you the 

00:00:57.390 --> 00:01:00.239
 see all the information 

00:00:58.949 --> 00:01:02.789
 important including your notifications 

00:01:00.239 --> 00:01:04.110
 and on the top with this tweak you have 

00:01:02.789 --> 00:01:05.760
 shortcuts for the main 

00:01:04.110 --> 00:01:07.980
 system settings like here for example 

00:01:05.760 --> 00:01:08.460
 the wifi you also have the mode do not 

00:01:07.980 --> 00:01:10.440
 bother 

00:01:08.460 --> 00:01:12.960
 you can enable or disable the 

00:01:10.440 --> 00:01:15.030
 location make a res pring everything to 

00:01:12.960 --> 00:01:16.170
 left here we have the airplane mode you see 

00:01:15.030 --> 00:01:17.640
 that every time the state of the small 

00:01:16.170 --> 00:01:19.440
 shortcuts changes and fits in 

00:01:17.640 --> 00:01:20.820
 function of what you do it's 

00:01:19.440 --> 00:01:22.560
 so super convenient as usual 

00:01:20.820 --> 00:01:23.670
 you had to unlock your device 

00:01:22.560 --> 00:01:24.360
 to have access to all these 

00:01:23.670 --> 00:01:26.040
 news 

00:01:24.360 --> 00:01:27.480
 now with this tweak and you have 

00:01:26.040 --> 00:01:30.210
 all this in the notifications center 

00:01:27.480 --> 00:01:31.620
 accessible like these and you can 

00:01:30.210 --> 00:01:33.150
 also slid on the right for 

00:01:31.620 --> 00:01:35.520
 reveal other shortcuts for them 

00:01:33.150 --> 00:01:36.750
 system settings including the torch the 

00:01:35.520 --> 00:01:38.670
 3g volume 

00:01:36.750 --> 00:01:40.290
 you also have bluetooth and 

00:01:38.670 --> 00:01:41.820
 especially a short cut for you 

00:01:40.290 --> 00:01:44.280
 go straight to the settings 

00:01:41.820 --> 00:01:46.410
 you just have to support justice there is 

00:01:44.280 --> 00:01:47.310
 you're redirected since we're in 

00:01:46.410 --> 00:01:48.720
 the settings that will give us 

00:01:47.310 --> 00:01:50.700
 the opportunity to go to the panel of 

00:01:48.720 --> 00:01:52.950
 configuration of the tweak and will go up here 

00:01:50.700 --> 00:01:54.180
 first you have the list of all 

00:01:52.950 --> 00:01:56.640
 shortcuts for system settings 

00:01:54.180 --> 00:01:58.800
 is at the bottom an option in off for 

00:01:56.640 --> 00:02:00.410
 enable or disable the tweak and if 

00:01:58.800 --> 00:02:02.670
 you do it it will be necessary to make a racing 

00:02:00.410 --> 00:02:04.320
 then you can change yourself 

00:02:02.670 --> 00:02:05.700
 organizing shortcuts for them 

00:02:04.320 --> 00:02:07.170
 system settings 

00:02:05.700 --> 00:02:09.360
 could change the order by going up 

00:02:07.170 --> 00:02:11.250
 some go down others for 

00:02:09.360 --> 00:02:12.840
 place in the order you prefer there 

00:02:11.250 --> 00:02:14.940
 for example I put the shortcut for 

00:02:12.840 --> 00:02:16.500
 the settings first and if we 

00:02:14.940 --> 00:02:17.970
 locks the device that is unlocked 

00:02:16.500 --> 00:02:19.590
 we will check if it worked 

00:02:17.970 --> 00:02:21.810
 I go down the notification center 

00:02:19.590 --> 00:02:24.390
 and yes the shortcut is placed in 

00:02:21.810 --> 00:02:26.280
 first is perfect your center of 

00:02:24.390 --> 00:02:27.480
 notifications goes down so over 

00:02:26.280 --> 00:02:29.400
 your wallpaper on the screen of 

00:02:27.480 --> 00:02:31.650
 lock by blurring the background 

00:02:29.400 --> 00:02:33.480
 by showing you the shortcuts and your 

00:02:31.650 --> 00:02:35.640
 notifications and besides you can 

00:02:33.480 --> 00:02:37.230
 interact with this one look in 

00:02:35.640 --> 00:02:38.790
 pressing the notifications wanted 

00:02:37.230 --> 00:02:40.560
 unrolled and buttons appear 

00:02:38.790 --> 00:02:42.840
 especially the one that allows you to delete 

00:02:40.560 --> 00:02:44.430
 one by one the notifications so a 

00:02:42.840 --> 00:02:46.950
 really handy feature 

00:02:44.430 --> 00:02:48.630
 you can also unrolled entirely 

00:02:46.950 --> 00:02:51.209
 notifications to see the totality 

00:02:48.630 --> 00:02:52.650
 of the message as now so here is 

00:02:51.209 --> 00:02:54.329
 how does it work and that for 

00:02:52.650 --> 00:02:55.620
 any notification you are going 

00:02:54.329 --> 00:02:56.220
 receive for any 

00:02:55.620 --> 00:02:58.739
 application 

00:02:56.220 --> 00:03:00.540
 and finally the last button launch you 

00:02:58.739 --> 00:03:02.579
 allows to launch the application concerned 

00:03:00.540 --> 00:03:03.810
 this is the mail application you see 

00:03:02.579 --> 00:03:05.090
 that I am directly in the mail 

00:03:03.810 --> 00:03:07.349
 ready to answer them 

00:03:05.090 --> 00:03:08.310
 then to finish last little detail 

00:03:07.349 --> 00:03:09.810
 with this tweak 

00:03:08.310 --> 00:03:11.940
 when you're reading a 

00:03:09.810 --> 00:03:13.410
 music that the screen is locked 

00:03:11.940 --> 00:03:15.569
 that's how it's displayed so all of this 

00:03:13.410 --> 00:03:17.549
 thanks to cydia tweaks called ra 

00:03:15.569 --> 00:03:20.069

 only compatible with the iphone and 

00:03:21.720 --> 00:03:24.690
 the ipod touch jailbroken under ios 6 at 

00:03:24.150 --> 00:03:26.970
 minimum 

00:03:24.690 --> 00:03:28.980

00:03:26.970 --> 00:03:30.299
 which will allow you to have access to 

00:03:28.980 --> 00:03:31.680
 A lot of interesting information 

00:03:30.299 --> 00:03:33.569
 from your lock screen 

00:03:31.680 --> 00:03:35.100
