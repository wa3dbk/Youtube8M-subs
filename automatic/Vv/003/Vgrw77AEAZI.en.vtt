00:00:02.620 --> 00:00:05.620
 Hello 

00:00:09.749 --> 00:00:12.590
 it was very cold duck in this month of December 

00:00:12.590 --> 00:00:14.959
 and christmas is coming 

00:00:14.959 --> 00:00:18.039
 maesa a cold duck it's not very cold for a penguin 

00:00:19.369 --> 00:00:22.369
 marseille was your wise and thoughtful word 

00:00:23.230 --> 00:00:25.640
 he is his mom fishing for fish 

00:00:25.640 --> 00:00:28.979
 he never dragged his stuff in the winter or family 

00:00:28.979 --> 00:00:31.979
 also it appears the coming of Santa Claus with impatience 

00:00:32.790 --> 00:00:34.210
 patience 

00:00:34.210 --> 00:00:35.740
 a worry 

00:00:35.740 --> 00:00:38.710
 the case the books that had taught him 

00:00:38.710 --> 00:00:41.880
 we had to bow to a precise ritual 

00:00:41.880 --> 00:00:45.840
 Christmas night you had to put your shoes at the foot of the fireplace 

00:00:47.850 --> 00:00:51.610
 gold fireplace there was none in his office 

00:00:52.680 --> 00:00:56.660
 and have we ever seen a Santa Claus gifts placed vote ringing at the door 

00:00:56.660 --> 00:00:59.780
 as a vulgar red coat sellers 

00:00:59.780 --> 00:01:01.410
 Never mind 

00:01:01.410 --> 00:01:03.810
 it was not necessary to make one 

00:01:03.810 --> 00:01:06.250
 his parents left for several days of fishing 

00:01:06.250 --> 00:01:09.260
 he took the opportunity to carry out his project 

00:01:09.260 --> 00:01:12.170
 he cut blocks of ice that stopped at his house to build a 

00:01:12.170 --> 00:01:13.920
 beautiful fireplace 

00:01:13.920 --> 00:01:14.980
 finally 

00:01:14.980 --> 00:01:18.560
 he dug the roof which all led an opening towards the sky 

00:01:19.680 --> 00:01:21.360
 at their return 

00:01:21.360 --> 00:01:24.350
 his parents were ecstatic 

00:01:24.350 --> 00:01:27.020
 no you are talented and of the month told him his dad 

00:01:27.020 --> 00:01:30.020
 pity that we can not use them as tasks and 

00:01:30.680 --> 00:01:33.600
 small size good answers 

00:01:33.600 --> 00:01:36.600
 his father probably thought of the wood that was missing to light a fire 

00:01:37.450 --> 00:01:39.750
 m it had all planned 

00:01:39.750 --> 00:01:41.740
 his friend rock the seal 

00:01:41.740 --> 00:01:45.070
 with finding under the ice a boat wreck 

00:01:45.070 --> 00:01:47.170
 had brought back some pieces of the hull 

00:01:47.170 --> 00:01:49.470
 who had time to dry since 

00:01:49.470 --> 00:01:52.640
 they now form a pile of logs he had hidden in the back of his room 

00:01:54.610 --> 00:01:56.840
 December 24 

00:01:56.840 --> 00:01:59.840
 at this time Santa Claus had to call his sleigh 

00:02:00.420 --> 00:02:02.840
 marcela while the house is asleep 

00:02:02.840 --> 00:02:06.250
 and he silently deposited a few logs in the hearth of his chimney 

00:02:07.750 --> 00:02:08.899
 a little after 

00:02:08.899 --> 00:02:12.159
 the pretty flame of a fire started before him a belly dance 

00:02:15.159 --> 00:02:18.349
 marcellin think long term 

00:02:18.349 --> 00:02:21.620
 the smoke will guide him to the house and when he enters china where he can 

00:02:21.620 --> 00:02:23.049
 warm up 

00:02:23.049 --> 00:02:26.369
 pleased with him he went back to bed 

00:02:26.369 --> 00:02:28.959
 the next morning at dawn 

00:02:28.959 --> 00:02:32.489
 he opened canaille came out of his room slipping on the belly 

00:02:32.489 --> 00:02:35.859
 hurry to discover these gifts 

00:02:35.859 --> 00:02:37.169
 but gifts 

00:02:37.169 --> 00:02:39.809
 There were none 

00:02:39.809 --> 00:02:42.849
 we did not have slippers 

00:02:42.849 --> 00:02:45.849
 there was no chimney 

00:02:46.719 --> 00:02:48.299
 in place 

00:02:48.299 --> 00:02:50.369
 a big hole in the ground 

00:02:50.369 --> 00:02:52.469
 at the bottom of which very far 

00:02:52.469 --> 00:02:55.469
 splash and a big shadow 

00:02:56.529 --> 00:02:59.139
 I told you we could not use the fireplace and then his dad in 

00:02:59.139 --> 00:03:01.029
 putting a hand on his shoulder 

00:03:01.029 --> 00:03:04.090
 the bottom ice the knesset who did not listen 

00:03:05.219 --> 00:03:07.039
 I am sorry for Marseille 

00:03:07.039 --> 00:03:09.209
 sobs in his voice 

00:03:09.209 --> 00:03:11.199
 stifle not rare members 

00:03:11.199 --> 00:03:14.039
 I will fill 30 

00:03:14.039 --> 00:03:15.549
 head down 

00:03:15.549 --> 00:03:17.369
 the little bit less tournament 

00:03:17.369 --> 00:03:20.369
 nathan worthily sad in her room 

00:03:21.639 --> 00:03:22.849
 for sure 

00:03:22.849 --> 00:03:24.929
 the hole had swallowed these gifts 

00:03:24.929 --> 00:03:27.909
 at the same time as his shoes 

00:03:27.909 --> 00:03:30.909
 his heart that suddenly bombs his priesthood 

00:03:32.159 --> 00:03:34.539
 a wonderful step she was waiting for 

00:03:34.539 --> 00:03:37.039
 he had not noticed when waking up 

00:03:37.039 --> 00:03:38.439
 he is rushing 

00:03:38.439 --> 00:03:41.439
 he first opened the example lay on 

00:03:42.369 --> 00:03:45.119
 dear marc schwall 

00:03:45.119 --> 00:03:48.079
 there was a lot of heat at home 

00:03:48.079 --> 00:03:50.939
 but it was not that of fire 

00:03:50.939 --> 00:03:53.619
 it's the intention that counts 

00:03:53.619 --> 00:03:55.499
 here is a gift for you 

00:03:55.499 --> 00:03:57.649
 and only for you 

00:03:57.649 --> 00:03:59.549
 Merry Christmas 

00:03:59.549 --> 00:04:02.369
 Santa 

00:04:02.369 --> 00:04:04.309
 little penguin opened his gift 

00:04:04.309 --> 00:04:07.179
 his parents came noiselessly 

00:04:07.179 --> 00:04:08.200
 so 

00:04:08.200 --> 00:04:09.569
 discernment 

00:04:09.569 --> 00:04:11.879
 you have been spoiled 

00:04:11.879 --> 00:04:13.719
 ah yes said the little bit less 

00:04:13.719 --> 00:04:16.719
 look at it is a panoply of firefighters 

00:04:17.289 --> 00:04:18.299
 very proud 

00:04:18.299 --> 00:04:20.120
 he put on his leather jacket 

00:04:20.120 --> 00:04:22.990
 and what to do with his silver helmet 

00:04:22.990 --> 00:04:25.860
 common sense after sorting nor the advertised 

00:04:25.860 --> 00:04:27.569
 I present you the first 

00:04:27.569 --> 00:04:30.699
 and the only fireman in the pack ice 

00:04:30.699 --> 00:04:33.699
 you are therefore undermining the heritage replied his mother 

00:04:34.689 --> 00:04:36.659
 tight against each other 

00:04:36.659 --> 00:04:39.659
 he is alert and deaf 

00:04:41.770 --> 00:04:42.560
 Hello
