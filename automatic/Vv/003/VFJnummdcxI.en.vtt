00:00:12.430 --> 00:00:17.620
 this time I teach you to use a 

00:00:14.930 --> 00:00:21.250
 revolving card 

00:00:17.620 --> 00:00:23.080
 and the materials are a sheet of 

00:00:21.250 --> 00:00:25.240
 cartonboard with our printed pattern 

00:00:23.080 --> 00:00:27.510
 below I leave the link for between 

00:00:25.240 --> 00:00:27.510
 travels 

00:00:28.550 --> 00:00:33.980
 an exact one scissors a square and 

00:00:32.210 --> 00:00:37.100
 colored paper or whatever you want 

00:00:33.980 --> 00:00:38.970
 to decorate and from a cardboard what we're going 

00:00:37.100 --> 00:00:41.310
 to make the cuts 

00:00:38.970 --> 00:00:44.190
 The first thing we have to do is 

00:00:41.310 --> 00:00:47.070
 cut out this boat with the help of the exact 

00:00:44.190 --> 00:00:49.290
 and of d'esquadra 

00:00:47.070 --> 00:00:52.579
 eye you have to leave the lines that are going 

00:00:49.290 --> 00:00:52.579
 to do it for the folds 

00:00:52.850 --> 00:00:55.850
 two 

00:00:59.519 --> 00:01:04.899
 since you have the frame cut like this 

00:01:02.100 --> 00:01:08.520
 we respect the two months we are going to 

00:01:04.899 --> 00:01:08.520
 cut out the next figure 

00:01:11.570 --> 00:01:14.470
 i 

00:01:16.100 --> 00:01:20.750
 it is cut very carefully and in this 

00:01:19.130 --> 00:01:23.110
 remember that you are going to bend the figure 

00:01:20.750 --> 00:01:23.110
 entire 

00:01:23.189 --> 00:01:26.189
 ah 

00:01:26.450 --> 00:01:29.890
 ah 

00:01:27.730 --> 00:01:33.530
 the squad will also be useful for us 

00:01:29.890 --> 00:01:35.840
 mark the folds in our frame 

00:01:33.530 --> 00:01:38.690
 you only have to support yourself in squad 

00:01:35.840 --> 00:01:41.550
 to mark a double up and a 

00:01:38.690 --> 00:01:43.970
 fold down 

00:01:41.550 --> 00:01:43.970
 ah 

00:01:45.790 --> 00:01:50.340
 ah 

00:01:48.480 --> 00:01:52.320
 do not 

00:01:50.340 --> 00:01:54.880
 ah 

00:01:52.320 --> 00:01:56.799
 since we have the two parts cut out 

00:01:54.880 --> 00:01:59.590
 we are going to stick this with pencil 

00:01:56.799 --> 00:02:01.409
 adhesive or with registration is very 

00:01:59.590 --> 00:02:05.909
 important that the time to paste the 

00:02:01.409 --> 00:02:05.909
 practices that the piece turns freely 

00:02:09.690 --> 00:02:13.920
 this is going to be the cover and in this is the 

00:02:12.270 --> 00:02:15.820
 where will you go to the text of 

00:02:13.920 --> 00:02:19.280
 Our card 

00:02:15.820 --> 00:02:23.080
 since you have your piece armed and that you see 

00:02:19.280 --> 00:02:23.080
 that you turn is the moment to decorate 

00:02:25.920 --> 00:02:30.840
 Y 

00:02:27.880 --> 00:02:30.840
 Y 

00:02:31.460 --> 00:02:36.400
 or not 

00:02:34.090 --> 00:02:38.500
 To decorate it, I'm going to use sheets of 

00:02:36.400 --> 00:02:40.900
 paper but you can use what you 

00:02:38.500 --> 00:02:43.239
 you can use ribbons you can use 

00:02:40.900 --> 00:02:46.269
 any of the others that we already saw that 

00:02:43.239 --> 00:02:49.200
 it can be done with filigree all 

00:02:46.269 --> 00:02:49.200
 It depends on your imagination 

00:02:55.120 --> 00:02:57.659
