00:00:42.080 --> 00:00:42.090 
goes to a scizor I obviously can't stay

00:00:42.090 --> 00:00:45.440 
goes to a scizor I obviously can't stay
in<00:00:42.270> so<00:00:42.690> I<00:00:42.960> go<00:00:43.290> to<00:00:43.320> gyarados<00:00:43.800> and<00:00:44.129> he<00:00:45.120> sets<00:00:45.300> up<00:00:45.360> a

00:00:45.440 --> 00:00:45.450 
in so I go to gyarados and he sets up a

00:00:45.450 --> 00:00:47.990 
in so I go to gyarados and he sets up a
rain<00:00:45.690> dance<00:00:45.899> which<00:00:46.289> is<00:00:46.440> weird<00:00:46.739> but<00:00:47.640> uh<00:00:47.700> I

earthquake<00:00:48.710> expecting<00:00:49.710> him<00:00:49.890> to<00:00:49.920> switch<00:00:50.340> to

00:00:50.569 --> 00:00:50.579 
earthquake expecting him to switch to

00:00:50.579 --> 00:00:52.279 
earthquake expecting him to switch to
something<00:00:50.789> that<00:00:51.000> would<00:00:51.270> resist<00:00:51.719> waterfall

00:00:52.279 --> 00:00:52.289 
something that would resist waterfall

00:00:52.289 --> 00:00:56.799 
something that would resist waterfall
and<00:00:52.530> instead<00:00:53.460> he<00:00:53.640> you<00:00:53.820> turns<00:00:54.120> and<00:00:54.480> goes<00:00:55.010> to

00:00:56.799 --> 00:00:56.809 
and instead he you turns and goes to

00:00:56.809 --> 00:01:01.069 
and instead he you turns and goes to
kabutops<00:00:58.460> which<00:00:59.460> out<00:00:59.940> speeds<00:01:00.420> me<00:01:00.660> because<00:01:01.050> of

00:01:01.069 --> 00:01:01.079 
kabutops which out speeds me because of

00:01:01.079 --> 00:01:03.560 
kabutops which out speeds me because of

the rain dance so I go to UM Polian and
he<00:01:04.170> soars<00:01:04.470> dances<00:01:04.949> but<00:01:05.790> I<00:01:06.030> think<00:01:06.540> I<00:01:06.659> can<00:01:06.689> live<00:01:06.990> a

00:01:07.039 --> 00:01:07.049 
he soars dances but I think I can live a

00:01:07.049 --> 00:01:11.060 
he soars dances but I think I can live a
hit<00:01:07.290> and<00:01:07.490> turns<00:01:08.490> out<00:01:08.700> waterfall<00:01:09.500> almost<00:01:10.500> kills

00:01:11.060 --> 00:01:11.070 
hit and turns out waterfall almost kills

00:01:11.070 --> 00:01:14.359 
hit and turns out waterfall almost kills
me<00:01:11.340> but<00:01:12.270> surf<00:01:13.020> with<00:01:13.409> torrent<00:01:13.860> in<00:01:13.979> the<00:01:14.189> rain

00:01:14.359 --> 00:01:14.369

00:01:21.170 --> 00:01:21.180 
does kill him but he sends in scizor and

00:01:21.180 --> 00:01:23.270 
does kill him but he sends in scizor and
I'm<00:01:21.689> pretty<00:01:21.990> useless<00:01:22.290> so<00:01:22.710> I<00:01:22.740> just<00:01:23.040> let<00:01:23.189> him

00:01:23.270 --> 00:01:23.280 
I'm pretty useless so I just let him

00:01:23.280 --> 00:01:27.230 
I'm pretty useless so I just let him
bullet<00:01:23.580> punch<00:01:23.790> and<00:01:24.090> kill<00:01:24.270> me<00:01:25.580> so<00:01:26.580> I<00:01:26.790> send

00:01:30.469 --> 00:01:30.479 
gyarados back in this time I do

00:01:30.479 --> 00:01:35.630 
gyarados back in this time I do
waterfall<00:01:31.079> and<00:01:31.740> I<00:01:31.920> hit<00:01:32.250> a<00:01:32.600> Zapdos<00:01:33.600> and<00:01:34.640> with

00:01:35.630 --> 00:01:35.640 
waterfall and I hit a Zapdos and with

00:01:35.640 --> 00:01:38.390 
waterfall and I hit a Zapdos and with
the<00:01:35.790> rain<00:01:35.970> dance<00:01:36.270> it<00:01:36.479> does<00:01:36.630> almost<00:01:36.960> half<00:01:37.470> but<00:01:38.220> I

00:01:38.390 --> 00:01:38.400 
the rain dance it does almost half but I

00:01:38.400 --> 00:01:40.910 
the rain dance it does almost half but I
notice<00:01:38.759> he<00:01:38.880> has<00:01:39.090> no<00:01:39.479> leftovers<00:01:40.229> so<00:01:40.829> I'm

00:01:40.910 --> 00:01:40.920 
notice he has no leftovers so I'm

00:01:40.920 --> 00:01:43.219 
notice he has no leftovers so I'm
thinking<00:01:40.979> he's<00:01:41.310> probably<00:01:41.640> scarf<00:01:42.150> so<00:01:42.780> I<00:01:42.810> have

00:01:43.219 --> 00:01:43.229 
thinking he's probably scarf so I have

00:01:43.229 --> 00:01:46.340 
thinking he's probably scarf so I have
to<00:01:43.409> switch<00:01:43.649> out<00:01:43.860> and<00:01:44.450> he<00:01:45.450> does<00:01:45.630> a<00:01:45.659> thunder<00:01:46.110> and

00:01:46.340 --> 00:01:46.350 
to switch out and he does a thunder and

00:01:46.350 --> 00:01:48.560 
to switch out and he does a thunder and
because<00:01:46.710> the<00:01:46.860> sandstorm<00:01:47.310> it<00:01:47.490> misses<00:01:47.880> but<00:01:48.479> he

00:01:48.560 --> 00:01:48.570 
because the sandstorm it misses but he

00:01:48.570 --> 00:01:50.539 
because the sandstorm it misses but he
goes<00:01:48.720> to<00:01:48.840> oopsie<00:01:49.259> I<00:01:49.439> stone<00:01:50.009> edge<00:01:50.220> it<00:01:50.399> and

00:01:50.539 --> 00:01:50.549 
goes to oopsie I stone edge it and

00:01:50.549 --> 00:01:52.760 
goes to oopsie I stone edge it and
because<00:01:51.329> he<00:01:51.420> gave<00:01:51.570> me<00:01:51.689> a<00:01:51.720> scarf<00:01:52.170> instead<00:01:52.590> of<00:01:52.710> a

00:01:52.760 --> 00:01:52.770 
because he gave me a scarf instead of a

00:01:52.770 --> 00:01:57.649 
because he gave me a scarf instead of a
choice<00:01:52.920> band<00:01:53.280> he<00:01:53.670> doesn't<00:01:54.240> die<00:01:55.790> so<00:01:56.790> I<00:01:57.240> figure

00:01:57.649 --> 00:01:57.659 
choice band he doesn't die so I figure

00:01:57.659 --> 00:01:59.179 
choice band he doesn't die so I figure
he'll<00:01:57.810> stealth<00:01:58.170> rock<00:01:58.439> here<00:01:58.799> so<00:01:58.950> I<00:01:59.009> got<00:01:59.159> a

00:01:59.179 --> 00:01:59.189 
he'll stealth rock here so I got a

00:01:59.189 --> 00:02:02.300 
he'll stealth rock here so I got a
gyarados<00:01:59.670> but<00:02:00.060> he<00:02:00.299> rain<00:02:00.570> dances<00:02:01.049> instead<00:02:01.469> but

00:02:02.300 --> 00:02:02.310 
gyarados but he rain dances instead but

00:02:02.310 --> 00:02:03.910 
gyarados but he rain dances instead but
a<00:02:02.340> either<00:02:02.759> way<00:02:03.000> I<00:02:03.299> can

00:02:03.910 --> 00:02:03.920 
a either way I can

00:02:03.920 --> 00:02:10.719 
a either way I can
he'll<00:02:04.040> kill<00:02:04.460> him<00:02:08.380> so<00:02:09.380> he<00:02:09.979> goes<00:02:10.099> to<00:02:10.160> that<00:02:10.399> thing

00:02:10.719 --> 00:02:10.729 
he'll kill him so he goes to that thing
