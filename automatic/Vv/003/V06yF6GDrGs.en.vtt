00:00:01.819 --> 00:00:06.450
 Only then will the train move from its new eleven million should it be over again 

00:00:06.450 --> 00:00:11.530
 The caps Klein celebrated there are now also for the iPad is also quite high up 

00:00:11.530 --> 00:00:15.969
 in the fall dollars and she has been improved Escada with the last 

00:00:15.969 --> 00:00:18.969
 Version still some difficulty with playing videos 

00:00:19.650 --> 00:00:23.750
 and that's why I've caught up now does not cost much 

00:00:23.750 --> 00:00:26.779
 Cook always sees between two and three euros 

00:00:26.779 --> 00:00:31.070
 Mister Cognis did this action because you get something cheaper 

00:00:31.070 --> 00:00:31.789
 Indeed 

00:00:31.789 --> 00:00:37.050
 yes, this app also really offers that you can now on most pages in the 

00:00:37.050 --> 00:00:40.109
 Internet the area the Russians use the main post 

00:00:40.109 --> 00:00:43.640
 Play with the iPad and the iPhone 

00:00:43.640 --> 00:00:46.499
 how the whole thing will work out now 

00:00:46.499 --> 00:00:49.809
 Of course, we have to be careful, of course, and of course 

00:00:49.809 --> 00:00:51.120
 really could 

00:00:51.120 --> 00:00:52.490
 that around 

00:00:52.490 --> 00:00:56.690
 our page is now set here on the clockwork format because 

00:00:56.690 --> 00:01:00.030
 If this page is also set to Sibel format 

00:01:00.030 --> 00:01:03.580
 then of course the whole thing will not make sense if that is on the 

00:01:03.580 --> 00:01:07.920
 Brett Format will have to be against a professional in these questions about my video 

00:01:07.920 --> 00:01:09.329
 we are looking for you 

00:01:09.329 --> 00:01:10.830
 so 

00:01:10.830 --> 00:01:12.700
 including me too 

00:01:12.700 --> 00:01:15.410
 and then you were for a moment 

00:01:15.410 --> 00:01:20.160
 For example, we already see the effort well so massive percent 

00:01:20.160 --> 00:01:22.009
 all in the blood for blood 2 

00:01:22.009 --> 00:01:26.760
 the one time just no, why do we do it all this way? 

00:01:26.760 --> 00:01:30.690
 Now there is definitely Naldo as maybe more 

00:01:30.690 --> 00:01:31.820
 To update 

00:01:31.820 --> 00:01:33.940
 So the normal error messages 

00:01:33.940 --> 00:01:38.060
 You can now allegedly bypass him and video clips 

00:01:38.060 --> 00:01:41.719
 Among other things happened following it was found a video 

00:01:42.400 --> 00:01:43.990
 since then she has lived 

00:01:43.990 --> 00:01:45.300
 and around 

00:01:45.300 --> 00:01:49.810
 he is ready to play this video in 20 seconds the first were now 

00:01:49.810 --> 00:01:51.500
 also a little bit 

00:01:51.500 --> 00:01:56.140
 and then you get the same if and the video player plays now says the 

00:01:56.140 --> 00:01:59.710
 Website announces ready to take off and just take a look 

00:02:00.220 --> 00:02:03.220
 and then we have to wait 

00:02:04.980 --> 00:02:06.890
 so took a moment 

00:02:06.890 --> 00:02:10.110
 and should someday start to play that 

00:02:19.119 --> 00:02:22.939
 Some say this is a satisfactory result 

00:02:22.939 --> 00:02:23.650
 see 

00:02:23.650 --> 00:02:27.150
 Jason Mark Webber was unable to do this 

00:02:27.150 --> 00:02:31.480
 but if you look at others with the direct video link as well 

00:02:31.480 --> 00:02:34.219
 quite fast and fluent dar play synonymous 

00:02:34.219 --> 00:02:37.909
 Zeller good thing Ammann can Ezio of course still further 

00:02:37.909 --> 00:02:41.390
 Partner page views on Facebook are now synonymous these videos 

00:02:41.390 --> 00:02:44.630
 and also the other place has already tested some more 

00:02:45.369 --> 00:02:47.989
 Schmelzer also runs perfectly 

00:02:47.989 --> 00:02:52.810
 and everything else really very good overall you can with this appeal 

00:02:52.810 --> 00:02:55.409
 he could really do something now 

00:02:55.409 --> 00:03:00.129
 For the price definitely very very ok you have to go once 

00:03:00.129 --> 00:03:04.449
 Also not beautiful speeches any special features could be achieved more 

00:03:04.449 --> 00:03:07.369
 that works now even if the ball in the net 

00:03:07.369 --> 00:03:10.949
 It is only to be recommended here, so if you do not have it, you can stay here for so long 

00:03:10.949 --> 00:03:14.999
 maybe even Ulm men would like to watch videos again and again 

00:03:14.999 --> 00:03:16.909
 granted with his respective 

00:03:16.909 --> 00:03:20.650
 and the water is not his territory, of course I hope so 

00:03:20.650 --> 00:03:23.889
 such a case, I always think about the tree to make my beautiful 

00:03:23.889 --> 00:03:26.760
 Harmonies take place on Facebook Follow on Twitter 

00:03:26.760 --> 00:03:30.230
 will always be up to date so he wants to get out and his 

00:03:30.230 --> 00:03:30.779
 Tweets 

00:03:30.779 --> 00:03:32.680
 and see you next video
