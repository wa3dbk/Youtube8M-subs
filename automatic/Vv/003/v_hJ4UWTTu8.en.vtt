00:00:00.869 --> 00:00:03.060
 if a 

00:00:03.060 --> 00:00:06.060
 ed km but interesting speech 

00:00:06.610 --> 00:00:08.630
 she works stanislavsky 

00:00:08.630 --> 00:00:11.630
 organizations 

00:00:12.459 --> 00:00:15.459
 we need to understand can 

00:00:19.800 --> 00:00:22.859
 yes and pr 

00:00:22.859 --> 00:00:25.359
 So 

00:00:25.359 --> 00:00:28.359
 that is, what gives us how writes kp 

00:00:30.300 --> 00:00:33.300
 ed 

00:00:35.030 --> 00:00:38.030
 near 

00:00:41.100 --> 00:00:44.400
 itâ€™s hard for us at the moment 5 6 percent 

00:00:44.400 --> 00:00:47.480
 0 analysis of subjects for this purpose 

00:00:47.480 --> 00:00:50.760
 I know 

00:00:50.760 --> 00:00:53.430
 Rector function is very much 

00:00:53.430 --> 00:00:55.870
 such as noted in sk Russia on bobsled 

00:00:55.870 --> 00:00:58.390
 that will help 

00:00:58.390 --> 00:01:01.450
 to return 

00:01:01.450 --> 00:01:03.780
 I will immediately say openly 

00:01:03.780 --> 00:01:07.420
 less often experienced gardener little cycle removal 

00:01:07.420 --> 00:01:10.880
 one time 

00:01:10.880 --> 00:01:13.790
 many things that are greek 

00:01:13.790 --> 00:01:15.470
 our teachers are current issues 

00:01:15.470 --> 00:01:17.740
 enough 

00:01:17.740 --> 00:01:19.670
 at the end of the world 

00:01:19.670 --> 00:01:21.540
 editing 

00:01:21.540 --> 00:01:24.100
 so so home users 

00:01:24.100 --> 00:01:25.430
 here is an example 

00:01:25.430 --> 00:01:27.860
 train that athens program analog 

00:01:27.860 --> 00:01:29.950
 antivirus 

00:01:29.950 --> 00:01:32.000
 here he is a multiple 

00:01:32.000 --> 00:01:35.110
 that this however experts say 

00:01:35.110 --> 00:01:35.969
 at all 

00:01:35.969 --> 00:01:37.520
 because it never happened 

00:01:37.520 --> 00:01:38.510
 antivirus 

00:01:38.510 --> 00:01:40.510
 me here it is 

00:01:40.510 --> 00:01:43.870
 on this project 

00:01:43.870 --> 00:01:46.870
 real world 

00:01:48.050 --> 00:01:50.390
 that is, all sorts of 

00:01:50.390 --> 00:01:51.320
 cube 5 

00:01:51.320 --> 00:01:54.680
 it turns out 

00:01:54.680 --> 00:01:57.590
 strange 

00:01:57.590 --> 00:02:00.530
 these blocks of course it's just a calculation, but what 

00:02:00.530 --> 00:02:03.020
 we have a lot of things 

00:02:03.020 --> 00:02:04.020
 and 

00:02:04.020 --> 00:02:07.010
 no less will stand in traffic jams 

00:02:07.010 --> 00:02:09.519
 I will be very 

00:02:09.519 --> 00:02:11.419
 it was about text 

00:02:11.419 --> 00:02:13.399
 need to create a fact to the prosecutor's office 

00:02:13.399 --> 00:02:16.399
 submissive what 

00:02:18.199 --> 00:02:20.019
 copy 

00:02:20.019 --> 00:02:22.049
 i.e 

00:02:22.049 --> 00:02:25.529
 here and it is necessary to deny any price 

00:02:25.529 --> 00:02:28.529
 as he noted 

00:02:29.819 --> 00:02:31.829
 what happens to them 

00:02:31.829 --> 00:02:35.549
 I read this draw cherry return 

00:02:35.549 --> 00:02:38.549
 fukuda astap here and so on 

00:02:42.179 --> 00:02:45.419
 I also have something 

00:02:45.419 --> 00:02:48.249
 again it works nonetheless 

00:02:48.249 --> 00:02:51.609
 0 7 at the peak of the planet for the future 

00:02:54.649 --> 00:02:56.939
 prove it as 

00:02:56.939 --> 00:02:57.800
 an award 

00:02:57.800 --> 00:03:00.479
 and 5.2 

00:03:00.479 --> 00:03:02.039
 so for viewing 

00:03:02.039 --> 00:03:02.689
 in the final
