 renaissance renaissance means 

00:00:09.670 --> 00:00:14.380
 rebirth it was the time of 

00:00:12.070 --> 00:00:22.090
 recollection of classic ideals in 

00:00:14.380 --> 00:00:24.400

 still dominates the city panorama today 

00:00:31.890 --> 00:00:37.480
 The Palazzo Vecchio was sitting the senior 

00:00:34.690 --> 00:00:39.970
 ina of the city parliament and the 

00:00:37.480 --> 00:00:42.160
 republic government makes political 

00:00:39.970 --> 00:00:44.340
 clearly the most important building of the 

00:00:42.160 --> 00:00:44.340
 city 

00:00:49.220 --> 00:00:54.690
 a second look at the city panorama 

00:00:52.050 --> 00:00:57.629
 shows that the tower of the palazzo vecchio 

00:00:54.690 --> 00:01:02.059
 just from a building in the shade 

00:00:57.629 --> 00:01:02.059
 is posed by the dome's dome 

00:01:07.590 --> 00:01:12.240
 since its completion almost 600 years ago 

00:01:10.259 --> 00:01:15.409
 years, this dome is the landmark 

00:01:12.240 --> 00:01:15.409
 of florence 

00:01:18.640 --> 00:01:22.860
 over 100 years was worked on dom 

00:01:25.660 --> 00:01:31.220
 the pretty one with red green and white 

00:01:29.030 --> 00:01:33.350
 marble decorated campanile of giotto 

00:01:31.220 --> 00:01:36.110
 was still in the fourteenth century 

00:01:33.350 --> 00:01:38.300
 built with his works over the 

00:01:36.110 --> 00:01:44.750
 window openings he is obvious 

00:01:38.300 --> 00:01:47.240
 still installation of the Gothic cathedral was now too 

00:01:44.750 --> 00:01:50.990
 beginning of the 15th century up to 

00:01:47.240 --> 00:01:53.540
 a green de dome finished the city 

00:01:50.990 --> 00:01:58.280
 led a tender by the 

00:01:53.540 --> 00:02:01.070
 order received filippo brunelleschi he 

00:01:58.280 --> 00:02:03.920
 built a cantilevered dome on one 

00:02:01.070 --> 00:02:06.729
 foundation of masonry made of simple 

00:02:03.920 --> 00:02:09.550
 Bricks without an inner scaffold 

00:02:06.729 --> 00:02:12.020
 supported only by external ribs 

00:02:09.550 --> 00:02:13.790
 it was a handcrafted and 

00:02:12.020 --> 00:02:16.310
 mathematical masterpiece 

00:02:13.790 --> 00:02:19.280
 this huge 107 meter high 

00:02:16.310 --> 00:02:26.540
 octagonal cupola became a symbol 

00:02:19.280 --> 00:02:28.970
 new epoch the terracotta medallions 

00:02:26.540 --> 00:02:31.250
 of wickel children are the ornaments 

00:02:28.970 --> 00:02:33.230
 a profane build the bonner lesky about 

00:02:31.250 --> 00:02:36.230
 planned with the dom at the same time 

00:02:33.230 --> 00:02:37.760
 his design of a findel house that 

00:02:36.230 --> 00:02:39.769
 the richness of the pages weavers 

00:02:37.760 --> 00:02:41.780
 had donated the narrow streets 

00:02:39.769 --> 00:02:43.959
 the medieval city far behind 

00:02:41.780 --> 00:02:43.959
 yourself 

00:02:45.370 --> 00:02:49.639
 basis for the draft of the open 

00:02:47.870 --> 00:02:52.549
 Arcade gangs with the slender ones 

00:02:49.639 --> 00:02:54.799
 Corinthian columns are squares whose 

00:02:52.549 --> 00:02:55.480
 Outline you can see in the floor tiles 

00:02:54.799 --> 00:02:58.280
 can 

00:02:55.480 --> 00:03:00.769
 the elements are not fundamentally new 

00:02:58.280 --> 00:03:04.329
 But the overall impression was for the 

00:03:00.769 --> 00:03:04.329
 renaissance trendsetting 

00:03:21.090 --> 00:03:25.140
 The time of the Renaissance brought in 

00:03:22.800 --> 00:03:27.290
 renewed unusual growth of 

00:03:25.140 --> 00:03:27.290
 cities 

00:03:36.530 --> 00:03:41.220
 rich trade genders like that 

00:03:38.940 --> 00:03:42.840
 medici were building palaces in 

00:03:41.220 --> 00:03:44.670
 which business premises as well as the 

00:03:42.840 --> 00:03:47.459
 Private rooms were accommodated 

00:03:44.670 --> 00:03:49.260
 like the palazzo medici ricardo with the 

00:03:47.459 --> 00:03:51.950
 three very different designs 

00:03:49.260 --> 00:03:51.950
 storeys 

00:03:52.760 --> 00:03:57.090
 characteristic of this time is that 

00:03:55.080 --> 00:03:59.730
 strong fortified ground floor 

00:03:57.090 --> 00:04:01.830
 rough stone blocks and the flat only 

00:03:59.730 --> 00:04:03.650
 through well - emphasized facade of 

00:04:01.830 --> 00:04:06.150
 upper floors 

00:04:03.650 --> 00:04:10.550
 the financial statements is a projected 

00:04:06.150 --> 00:04:10.550
 jumping roof with a wreath cornice 

00:04:16.230 --> 00:04:20.460
 a man of renaissance this one 

00:04:18.600 --> 00:04:21.740
 Dedicated to the exhibition was leon 

00:04:20.460 --> 00:04:23.930
 battista alberti 

00:04:21.740 --> 00:04:26.910
 He was the son of an aristocratic 

00:04:23.930 --> 00:04:27.960
 Family educated in the sciences 

00:04:26.910 --> 00:04:30.510
 and the arts 

00:04:27.960 --> 00:04:33.810
 he was an author and an outstanding 

00:04:30.510 --> 00:04:36.210
 Architect and city planner a city 

00:04:33.810 --> 00:04:38.630
 be built according to ancient models was 

00:04:36.210 --> 00:04:38.630
 ideal 

00:04:40.540 --> 00:04:44.680
 in his buildings he always uses 

00:04:42.580 --> 00:04:49.540
 shape again from the ancient as 

00:04:44.680 --> 00:04:51.880
 Corinthian columns nebulae over 

00:04:49.540 --> 00:04:54.630
 doors and windows and of course 

00:04:51.880 --> 00:04:54.630
 the round arch 

00:04:58.409 --> 00:05:03.059
 even if the time obviously at the 

00:05:00.239 --> 00:05:05.550
 facade of the tempo di san sebastiano in 

00:05:03.059 --> 00:05:07.589
 mantua left her marks like that 

00:05:05.550 --> 00:05:11.779
 are the underlying outlines 

00:05:07.589 --> 00:05:11.779
 of an ancient temple clearly visible 

00:05:14.929 --> 00:05:21.300
 the floor plan of san sebastiano is 

00:05:18.179 --> 00:05:23.249
 symmetrical he is unmistakable 

00:05:21.300 --> 00:05:31.649
 geometric shapes like square 

00:05:23.249 --> 00:05:33.389
 Rectangle and circle constructs simple 

00:05:31.649 --> 00:05:35.339
 how to shape them in the plan of 

00:05:33.389 --> 00:05:38.599
 much praised as la rotonda of 

00:05:35.339 --> 00:05:38.599
 palladio finds again 

00:05:43.080 --> 00:05:47.849
 molds were made according to ancient models 

00:05:45.569 --> 00:05:49.379
 used in other epochs too 

00:05:47.849 --> 00:05:51.740
 never as convincing as in the 

00:05:49.379 --> 00:05:51.740
 Renaissance 

00:05:59.320 --> 00:06:03.850
 what could you add here or 

00:06:01.180 --> 00:06:06.510
 lose weight without the harmonic whole 

00:06:03.850 --> 00:06:06.510
 to destroy 

00:06:10.920 --> 00:06:19.020
 alberti writes in his theory 

00:06:13.410 --> 00:06:21.960
 the essence of the beautiful the harmony of all 

00:06:19.020 --> 00:06:24.390
 Parts will be reached where nothing 

00:06:21.960 --> 00:06:27.270
 does not change anything added or 

00:06:24.390 --> 00:06:31.640
 can be omitted without the 

00:06:27.270 --> 00:06:31.640
 harmony of the whole is diminished 

00:06:32.090 --> 00:06:36.900
 this harmony was sought by the architects 

00:06:35.160 --> 00:06:39.530
 the renaissance in their buildings too 

00:06:36.900 --> 00:06:39.530
 realize 

00:06:42.140 --> 00:06:47.250
 It was the Nuremberg Albrecht Durer of 

00:06:45.570 --> 00:06:53.910
 the italian renaissance too 

00:06:47.250 --> 00:06:56.940
 made north of the Alps to be known 

00:06:53.910 --> 00:06:59.850
 Self-portrait in a fur coat shows them 

00:06:56.940 --> 00:07:01.800
 at the age of 28 a wealthy one 

00:06:59.850 --> 00:07:03.320
 young man facing the viewer head-on 

00:07:01.800 --> 00:07:05.880
 opposite 

00:07:03.320 --> 00:07:08.250
 Here we are eye to eye with one 

00:07:05.880 --> 00:07:10.890
 self confident artist a man of 

00:07:08.250 --> 00:07:14.210
 renaissance in the tradition here 

00:07:10.890 --> 00:07:14.210
 I can not help it 

00:07:16.980 --> 00:07:20.580
 It took almost 100 years to get the 

00:07:19.080 --> 00:07:25.140
 renaissance north of the alps 

00:07:20.580 --> 00:07:27.900
 interspersed it was the augsburger 

00:07:25.140 --> 00:07:29.940
 Baumeister Elias Holl on the road 

00:07:27.900 --> 00:07:32.610
 after bolzano and venice palladius sake 

00:07:29.940 --> 00:07:35.070
 got to know each other and in his hometown 

00:07:32.610 --> 00:07:38.180
 augsburg in the style of the high renaissance the 

00:07:35.070 --> 00:07:38.180
 city ​​hall designed 

00:07:41.990 --> 00:07:45.950
 the massive central construction is going through 

00:07:44.210 --> 00:07:50.120
 different sized windows 

00:07:45.950 --> 00:07:52.000
 articulated 2 where luton join the 

00:07:50.120 --> 00:07:54.680
 high gable with the facade 

00:07:52.000 --> 00:07:56.810
 unlike in earlier renaissance 

00:07:54.680 --> 00:07:58.640
 Façades are not the decorative elements 

00:07:56.810 --> 00:08:01.790
 flat but continue to advance 

00:07:58.640 --> 00:08:05.530
 a small but unmistakable note 

00:08:01.790 --> 00:08:05.530
 at the beginning of a new epoch
