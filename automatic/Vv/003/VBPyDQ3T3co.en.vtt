00:00:01.670 --> 00:00:09.000
 So thats it, Guilherme, your handset. 

00:00:06.379 --> 00:00:14.930
 working 

00:00:09.000 --> 00:00:14.930
 you can hear the noise from there w 

00:00:14.969 --> 00:00:25.000
 thence when you bring the metal there 

00:00:19.360 --> 00:00:34.780
 Coil muted at the goal frequency 

00:00:25.000 --> 00:00:41.530
 the noise and sensitivity of the system 

00:00:34.780 --> 00:00:48.640
 is directly connected to the mass of the metal 

00:00:41.530 --> 00:00:54.100
 which approaches the coil the large mass 

00:00:48.640 --> 00:00:58.539
 is a greater distance and gives the 

00:00:54.100 --> 00:01:05.489
 difference in the final frequency when 

00:00:58.539 --> 00:01:05.489
 the mass of the metal object is smaller 

00:01:05.770 --> 00:01:14.620
 sensitivity and also decreases and 

00:01:10.240 --> 00:01:21.850
 you have to get closer to the difference 

00:01:14.620 --> 00:01:24.480
 frequency of the oscillation of the 

00:01:21.850 --> 00:01:24.480
 equipment 

00:01:40.399 --> 00:01:56.460
 also critical the adjustment has to leave 

00:01:51.479 --> 00:02:02.159
 low frequency in order to feel the 

00:01:56.460 --> 00:02:06.090
 difference in an easier way but it is 

00:02:02.159 --> 00:02:10.229
 that is who knows how to improve the coil 

00:02:06.090 --> 00:02:12.560
 with both right turn comes the largest 

00:02:10.229 --> 00:02:12.560
 sensitivity
