covering<00:00:05.670> a<00:00:05.759> maintenance<00:00:06.150> break<00:00:06.359> that<00:00:06.540> clash

00:00:06.740 --> 00:00:06.750 
covering a maintenance break that clash

00:00:06.750 --> 00:00:08.900 
covering a maintenance break that clash
of<00:00:06.899> clans<00:00:07.140> did<00:00:07.410> today<00:00:07.710> and<00:00:07.950> I'd<00:00:08.400> safe<00:00:08.610> to<00:00:08.760> say

00:00:08.900 --> 00:00:08.910 
of clans did today and I'd safe to say

00:00:08.910 --> 00:00:10.669 
of clans did today and I'd safe to say
that<00:00:08.940> it's<00:00:09.240> something<00:00:09.450> pretty<00:00:09.870> weird<00:00:10.230> so<00:00:10.530> they

00:00:10.669 --> 00:00:10.679 
that it's something pretty weird so they

00:00:10.679 --> 00:00:12.290 
that it's something pretty weird so they
decided<00:00:11.070> that<00:00:11.190> they<00:00:11.340> would<00:00:11.550> reduce<00:00:11.820> the<00:00:12.030> train

00:00:12.290 --> 00:00:12.300 
decided that they would reduce the train

00:00:12.300 --> 00:00:14.480 
decided that they would reduce the train
time<00:00:12.540> the<00:00:12.840> Barbarian<00:00:13.349> and<00:00:13.530> the<00:00:13.620> dragon<00:00:14.040> and<00:00:14.130> it

00:00:14.480 --> 00:00:14.490 
time the Barbarian and the dragon and it

00:00:14.490 --> 00:00:16.039 
time the Barbarian and the dragon and it
actually<00:00:14.670> takes<00:00:15.089> twenty<00:00:15.509> percent<00:00:15.809> of<00:00:15.960> the

00:00:16.039 --> 00:00:16.049 
actually takes twenty percent of the

00:00:16.049 --> 00:00:17.540 
actually takes twenty percent of the
amount<00:00:16.199> of<00:00:16.320> time<00:00:16.500> that<00:00:16.529> it<00:00:16.740> used<00:00:16.859> to<00:00:17.160> take<00:00:17.310> and

00:00:17.540 --> 00:00:17.550 
amount of time that it used to take and

00:00:17.550 --> 00:00:18.590 
amount of time that it used to take and
as<00:00:17.880> you<00:00:18.000> can<00:00:18.119> see<00:00:18.150> right<00:00:18.300> there<00:00:18.570> the

00:00:18.590 --> 00:00:18.600 
as you can see right there the

00:00:18.600 --> 00:00:20.240 
as you can see right there the
barbarians<00:00:19.140> only<00:00:19.380> take<00:00:19.529> four<00:00:19.770> seconds<00:00:20.130> to

00:00:20.240 --> 00:00:20.250 
barbarians only take four seconds to

00:00:20.250 --> 00:00:22.460 
barbarians only take four seconds to
train<00:00:20.550> and<00:00:20.820> the<00:00:20.910> Dragons<00:00:21.330> take<00:00:21.600> six<00:00:21.960> minutes

00:00:22.460 --> 00:00:22.470 
train and the Dragons take six minutes

00:00:22.470 --> 00:00:24.620 
train and the Dragons take six minutes
so<00:00:22.680> pretty<00:00:23.100> strange<00:00:23.580> and<00:00:23.880> it<00:00:24.269> gets<00:00:24.390> even

00:00:24.620 --> 00:00:24.630 
so pretty strange and it gets even

00:00:24.630 --> 00:00:26.779 
so pretty strange and it gets even
weirder<00:00:24.990> if<00:00:25.350> you<00:00:25.470> boost<00:00:25.740> your<00:00:25.859> barracks<00:00:26.340> so<00:00:26.699> if

00:00:26.779 --> 00:00:26.789 
weirder if you boost your barracks so if

00:00:26.789 --> 00:00:28.040 
weirder if you boost your barracks so if
you<00:00:26.880> decide<00:00:27.210> to<00:00:27.330> boost<00:00:27.539> all<00:00:27.689> for<00:00:27.930> your

00:00:28.040 --> 00:00:28.050 
you decide to boost all for your

00:00:28.050 --> 00:00:30.230 
you decide to boost all for your
barracks<00:00:28.470> you<00:00:28.890> can<00:00:29.039> actually<00:00:29.160> reduce<00:00:29.939> the

00:00:30.230 --> 00:00:30.240 
barracks you can actually reduce the

00:00:30.240 --> 00:00:31.759 
barracks you can actually reduce the
train<00:00:30.510> time<00:00:30.750> of<00:00:30.929> the<00:00:30.990> Barbarian<00:00:31.470> to<00:00:31.590> one

00:00:31.759 --> 00:00:31.769 
train time of the Barbarian to one

00:00:31.769 --> 00:00:33.979 
train time of the Barbarian to one
second<00:00:32.279> and<00:00:32.399> the<00:00:33.030> dragon<00:00:33.239> to<00:00:33.480> an<00:00:33.600> even<00:00:33.840> lower

00:00:33.979 --> 00:00:33.989 
second and the dragon to an even lower

00:00:33.989 --> 00:00:36.410 
second and the dragon to an even lower
amount<00:00:34.590> so<00:00:35.010> yeah<00:00:35.430> I<00:00:35.640> decided<00:00:36.059> that<00:00:36.210> I<00:00:36.329> would

00:00:36.410 --> 00:00:36.420 
amount so yeah I decided that I would

00:00:36.420 --> 00:00:38.150 
amount so yeah I decided that I would
fill<00:00:36.600> up<00:00:36.690> my<00:00:36.719> army<00:00:37.050> camps<00:00:37.290> filled<00:00:37.469> with<00:00:37.680> Giants

00:00:38.150 --> 00:00:38.160 
fill up my army camps filled with Giants

00:00:38.160 --> 00:00:40.670 
fill up my army camps filled with Giants
also<00:00:38.760> put<00:00:38.910> some<00:00:39.090> barbarians<00:00:39.780> inside<00:00:40.230> of<00:00:40.469> my

00:00:40.670 --> 00:00:40.680 
also put some barbarians inside of my

00:00:40.680 --> 00:00:42.770 
also put some barbarians inside of my
barracks<00:00:41.129> and<00:00:41.430> after<00:00:42.149> you<00:00:42.239> go<00:00:42.360> to<00:00:42.390> your<00:00:42.540> army

directions but as you can see they go to
the<00:01:21.509> closest<00:01:21.869> army<00:01:22.110> camp<00:01:22.290> first<00:01:22.560> they're

00:01:23.090 --> 00:01:23.100 
the closest army camp first they're

00:01:23.100 --> 00:01:24.350 
the closest army camp first they're
gonna<00:01:23.220> split<00:01:23.580> to<00:01:23.729> the<00:01:23.820> left<00:01:24.060> and<00:01:24.210> the<00:01:24.299> right

00:01:24.350 --> 00:01:24.360 
gonna split to the left and the right

00:01:24.360 --> 00:01:25.940 
gonna split to the left and the right
army<00:01:24.810> camps<00:01:25.110> that<00:01:25.200> I<00:01:25.259> have<00:01:25.439> on<00:01:25.530> the<00:01:25.619> sides<00:01:25.830> of

00:01:25.940 --> 00:01:25.950 
army camps that I have on the sides of

00:01:25.950 --> 00:01:27.260 
army camps that I have on the sides of
my<00:01:26.009> base<00:01:26.250> and<00:01:26.580> then<00:01:26.700> finally<00:01:27.030> they're<00:01:27.150> going

00:01:27.260 --> 00:01:27.270 
my base and then finally they're going

00:01:27.270 --> 00:01:29.149 
my base and then finally they're going
to<00:01:27.330> go<00:01:27.390> to<00:01:27.479> the<00:01:27.570> very<00:01:27.720> bottom<00:01:27.900> and<00:01:28.200> fill<00:01:29.040> out

00:01:29.149 --> 00:01:29.159 
to go to the very bottom and fill out

00:01:29.159 --> 00:01:31.670 
to go to the very bottom and fill out
that<00:01:29.189> last<00:01:29.549> camp<00:01:29.820> so<00:01:30.210> pretty<00:01:30.479> weird<00:01:30.720> uh<00:01:30.960> there

00:01:31.670 --> 00:01:31.680 
that last camp so pretty weird uh there

00:01:31.680 --> 00:01:33.410 
that last camp so pretty weird uh there
might<00:01:31.710> be<00:01:31.950> some<00:01:32.369> reasoning<00:01:32.880> behind<00:01:33.000> these

00:01:33.410 --> 00:01:33.420 
might be some reasoning behind these

00:01:33.420 --> 00:01:35.240 
might be some reasoning behind these
changes<00:01:33.960> that<00:01:34.110> supercell<00:01:34.590> hasn't<00:01:34.950> told<00:01:35.100> us

00:01:35.240 --> 00:01:35.250 
changes that supercell hasn't told us

00:01:35.250 --> 00:01:37.490 
changes that supercell hasn't told us
just<00:01:35.549> yet<00:01:35.909> so<00:01:36.689> I<00:01:36.720> guess<00:01:36.900> we<00:01:37.049> should<00:01:37.200> just<00:01:37.229> stay

00:01:37.490 --> 00:01:37.500 
just yet so I guess we should just stay

00:01:37.500 --> 00:01:39.289 
just yet so I guess we should just stay
tuned<00:01:37.710> and<00:01:37.920> see<00:01:38.549> what<00:01:38.700> they<00:01:38.820> have<00:01:38.970> going<00:01:39.119> on

00:01:39.289 --> 00:01:39.299 
tuned and see what they have going on

00:01:39.299 --> 00:01:40.700 
tuned and see what they have going on
but<00:01:39.509> for<00:01:39.630> now<00:01:39.689> definitely<00:01:40.229> trade<00:01:40.380> up<00:01:40.470> a<00:01:40.560> bunch

00:01:40.700 --> 00:01:40.710 
but for now definitely trade up a bunch

00:01:40.710 --> 00:01:42.109 
but for now definitely trade up a bunch
