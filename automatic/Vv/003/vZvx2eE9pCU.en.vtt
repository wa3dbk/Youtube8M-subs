00:00:38.759 --> 00:00:38.769 
put anything below under 8 ohms but I

00:00:38.769 --> 00:00:40.709 
put anything below under 8 ohms but I
tried<00:00:39.489> it<00:00:39.519> last<00:00:39.640> night<00:00:39.879> and<00:00:40.149> it<00:00:40.239> seems<00:00:40.420> to<00:00:40.539> run

00:00:40.709 --> 00:00:40.719 
tried it last night and it seems to run

00:00:40.719 --> 00:00:42.660 
tried it last night and it seems to run
just<00:00:41.019> fine<00:00:41.260> so<00:00:41.920> I'm<00:00:42.069> not<00:00:42.159> gonna<00:00:42.309> play<00:00:42.489> it<00:00:42.519> for

00:00:42.660 --> 00:00:42.670 
just fine so I'm not gonna play it for

00:00:42.670 --> 00:00:44.910 
just fine so I'm not gonna play it for
too<00:00:42.789> long<00:00:42.940> so<00:00:43.210> this<00:00:43.780> thing<00:00:43.989> is<00:00:44.139> a<00:00:44.229> 4<00:00:44.499> ohm<00:00:44.649> sub

00:00:44.910 --> 00:00:44.920 
too long so this thing is a 4 ohm sub

00:00:44.920 --> 00:00:48.360 
too long so this thing is a 4 ohm sub
woofer<00:00:45.280> it's<00:00:46.149> 250<00:00:46.719> watts<00:00:46.899> RMS<00:00:47.469> and<00:00:47.769> 500<00:00:48.219> watts

00:00:48.360 --> 00:00:48.370 
woofer it's 250 watts RMS and 500 watts

00:00:48.370 --> 00:00:50.759 
woofer it's 250 watts RMS and 500 watts
max<00:00:48.539> there's<00:00:49.539> actually<00:00:50.229> another<00:00:50.499> version

00:00:50.759 --> 00:00:50.769 
max there's actually another version

00:00:50.769 --> 00:00:55.079 
max there's actually another version
where<00:00:51.129> it<00:00:51.489> features<00:00:51.909> dual<00:00:52.319> 12<00:00:53.319> and<00:00:53.859> that's<00:00:54.429> 500

00:00:55.079 --> 00:00:55.089 
where it features dual 12 and that's 500

00:00:55.089 --> 00:01:00.029 
where it features dual 12 and that's 500
watts<00:00:55.239> RMS<00:00:55.809> and<00:00:56.109> I<00:00:56.379> think<00:00:56.620> a<00:00:56.799> thousand<00:00:58.109> max<00:00:59.109> and

00:01:00.029 --> 00:01:00.039 
watts RMS and I think a thousand max and

00:01:00.039 --> 00:01:03.140 
watts RMS and I think a thousand max and
that<00:01:00.579> will<00:01:00.699> run<00:01:00.940> with<00:01:01.120> between<00:01:01.530> $200<00:01:02.530> and<00:01:02.559> up

00:01:03.140 --> 00:01:03.150 
that will run with between $200 and up

00:01:03.150 --> 00:01:06.750 
that will run with between $200 and up
of<00:01:04.150> course<00:01:04.330> this<00:01:04.420> is<00:01:04.540> much<00:01:04.780> larger<00:01:05.320> and<00:01:05.760> much

and on the back pretty much nothing but
it<00:01:44.650> is<00:01:44.680> slanted<00:01:45.340> so<00:01:45.550> it's<00:01:45.700> pretty<00:01:45.940> good<00:01:46.090> if<00:01:46.240> you

00:01:46.320 --> 00:01:46.330 
it is slanted so it's pretty good if you

00:01:46.330 --> 00:01:48.690 
it is slanted so it's pretty good if you
were<00:01:46.420> to<00:01:46.510> put<00:01:46.720> it<00:01:46.750> in<00:01:46.900> a<00:01:46.990> sedan<00:01:47.350> with<00:01:47.620> seats<00:01:48.520> are

slanted<00:01:49.120> but<00:01:49.630> pretty<00:01:49.840> much<00:01:50.020> good<00:01:50.230> for

00:01:50.370 --> 00:01:50.380 
slanted but pretty much good for

00:01:50.380 --> 00:01:53.370 
slanted but pretty much good for
anything<00:01:50.620> or<00:01:51.520> any<00:01:51.670> car<00:01:52.000> I<00:01:52.030> meant<00:01:52.420> because<00:01:53.020> it's

00:01:53.370 --> 00:01:53.380 
anything or any car I meant because it's

00:01:53.380 --> 00:01:55.560 
anything or any car I meant because it's
rather<00:01:53.620> small<00:01:53.890> light<00:01:54.430> and<00:01:54.760> it<00:01:55.180> sounds<00:01:55.510> really

00:01:55.560 --> 00:01:55.570 
rather small light and it sounds really

00:01:55.570 --> 00:01:57.899 
rather small light and it sounds really
good<00:01:55.840> really<00:01:56.470> loud<00:01:56.710> of<00:01:57.220> course<00:01:57.430> it's<00:01:57.580> not<00:01:57.700> like

00:01:57.899 --> 00:01:57.909 
good really loud of course it's not like

00:01:57.909 --> 00:02:00.180 
good really loud of course it's not like
a<00:01:57.940> competition<00:01:58.180> so<00:01:58.659> for<00:01:58.930> anything<00:01:59.200> you<00:02:00.040> know

00:02:00.180 --> 00:02:00.190 
a competition so for anything you know

00:02:00.190 --> 00:02:03.420 
a competition so for anything you know

mentioned<00:02:07.960> it's<00:02:08.080> got<00:02:08.259> a<00:02:08.289> side<00:02:09.009> firing<00:02:09.459> port

00:02:09.719 --> 00:02:09.729 
mentioned it's got a side firing port

00:02:09.729 --> 00:02:11.880 
mentioned it's got a side firing port
and<00:02:09.970> of<00:02:10.750> course<00:02:10.989> your<00:02:11.140> speaker<00:02:11.379> terminals<00:02:11.530> as

00:02:11.880 --> 00:02:11.890 
and of course your speaker terminals as

00:02:11.890 --> 00:02:15.270 
and of course your speaker terminals as
you<00:02:11.950> can<00:02:12.159> see<00:02:12.579> I<00:02:12.609> have<00:02:12.969> very<00:02:13.499> thin<00:02:14.499> cables<00:02:15.099> in

00:02:15.270 --> 00:02:15.280 
you can see I have very thin cables in

00:02:15.280 --> 00:02:18.479 
you can see I have very thin cables in
right<00:02:15.489> now<00:02:15.670> I<00:02:15.969> have<00:02:16.389> much<00:02:16.599> thicker<00:02:16.930> ones

00:02:18.479 --> 00:02:18.489 
right now I have much thicker ones

00:02:18.489 --> 00:02:20.729 
right now I have much thicker ones
currently<00:02:19.180> using<00:02:19.480> them<00:02:19.599> so<00:02:19.840> I'm<00:02:20.379> too<00:02:20.590> lazy

00:02:20.729 --> 00:02:20.739 
currently using them so I'm too lazy

00:02:20.739 --> 00:02:22.559 
currently using them so I'm too lazy
again<00:02:21.010> I'm<00:02:21.129> out<00:02:21.250> but<00:02:21.849> these<00:02:21.970> words<00:02:22.180> just<00:02:22.390> do

00:02:22.559 --> 00:02:22.569 
again I'm out but these words just do

00:02:22.569 --> 00:02:24.270 
again I'm out but these words just do
just<00:02:22.780> fine<00:02:22.959> they're<00:02:23.110> not<00:02:23.140> exactly<00:02:23.680> that<00:02:23.950> small

00:02:24.270 --> 00:02:24.280 
just fine they're not exactly that small

00:02:24.280 --> 00:02:25.890 
just fine they're not exactly that small
they<00:02:24.550> might<00:02:25.000> look<00:02:25.150> pretty<00:02:25.209> small<00:02:25.599> on<00:02:25.750> the

00:02:25.890 --> 00:02:25.900 
they might look pretty small on the

00:02:25.900 --> 00:02:27.479 
they might look pretty small on the
camera<00:02:26.230> but<00:02:26.410> they're<00:02:26.920> actually<00:02:27.069> much<00:02:27.310> larger

00:02:27.479 --> 00:02:27.489 
camera but they're actually much larger

00:02:27.489 --> 00:02:30.960 
camera but they're actually much larger
in<00:02:27.730> person<00:02:28.150> now<00:02:29.050> I'm<00:02:30.040> not<00:02:30.280> exactly<00:02:30.459> sure<00:02:30.730> watch

00:02:30.960 --> 00:02:30.970 
in person now I'm not exactly sure watch

00:02:30.970 --> 00:02:33.900 
in person now I'm not exactly sure watch
gage<00:02:31.209> they<00:02:31.450> are<00:02:31.569> but<00:02:31.780> they<00:02:32.680> do<00:02:33.190> find<00:02:33.400> some<00:02:33.730> just

00:02:33.900 --> 00:02:33.910 
gage they are but they do find some just

00:02:33.910 --> 00:02:35.400 
gage they are but they do find some just
can<00:02:34.030> use<00:02:34.150> them<00:02:34.269> for<00:02:34.300> now<00:02:34.540> for<00:02:34.810> a<00:02:34.840> little<00:02:35.140> bit

00:02:35.400 --> 00:02:35.410 
can use them for now for a little bit

00:02:35.410 --> 00:02:37.740 
can use them for now for a little bit
now<00:02:36.069> on<00:02:36.190> the<00:02:36.280> side<00:02:36.459> pretty<00:02:37.030> much<00:02:37.209> where<00:02:37.630> those

00:02:37.740 --> 00:02:37.750 
now on the side pretty much where those

00:02:37.750 --> 00:02:39.120 
now on the side pretty much where those
speaker<00:02:37.959> terminals<00:02:38.080> are<00:02:38.410> they<00:02:38.709> note<00:02:38.890> that<00:02:38.920> our

00:02:39.120 --> 00:02:39.130 
speaker terminals are they note that our

00:02:39.130 --> 00:02:41.309 
speaker terminals are they note that our
they<00:02:39.550> are<00:02:39.580> four<00:02:39.940> ohms<00:02:40.150> and<00:02:40.540> probably<00:02:40.959> not<00:02:41.110> to

00:02:41.309 --> 00:02:41.319 
they are four ohms and probably not to

00:02:41.319 --> 00:02:46.650 
they are four ohms and probably not to
put<00:02:41.500> anything<00:02:41.680> else<00:02:41.950> in<00:02:42.190> there<00:02:42.400> and<00:02:43.390> yeah<00:02:45.660> and

00:02:46.650 --> 00:02:46.660 
put anything else in there and yeah and

00:02:46.660 --> 00:02:48.030 
put anything else in there and yeah and
as<00:02:46.810> you<00:02:46.959> can<00:02:47.049> see<00:02:47.110> on<00:02:47.290> the<00:02:47.379> back<00:02:47.560> there's<00:02:47.920> a

00:02:48.030 --> 00:02:48.040 
as you can see on the back there's a

00:02:48.040 --> 00:02:50.880 
as you can see on the back there's a
slight<00:02:48.400> slant<00:02:48.790> it's<00:02:49.180> not<00:02:49.330> too<00:02:50.170> big<00:02:50.349> of<00:02:50.530> a<00:02:50.620> slant

00:02:50.880 --> 00:02:50.890 
slight slant it's not too big of a slant

00:02:50.890 --> 00:02:54.000 
slight slant it's not too big of a slant
but<00:02:51.130> it's<00:02:51.430> planted<00:02:51.790> four<00:02:52.620> just<00:02:53.620> like<00:02:53.650> I<00:02:53.799> said

00:02:54.000 --> 00:02:54.010 
but it's planted four just like I said

00:02:54.010 --> 00:02:56.160 
but it's planted four just like I said
four<00:02:54.310> sedans<00:02:54.610> or<00:02:54.849> anything<00:02:55.060> that<00:02:55.480> have

really try these against duel so AFER's

00:05:46.080 --> 00:05:50.689 
really try these against duel so AFER's
at-at<00:05:46.710> fries<00:05:47.340> I<00:05:47.759> tried<00:05:48.449> the<00:05:48.630> ones<00:05:49.530> that<00:05:50.460> had

00:05:50.689 --> 00:05:50.699 
at-at fries I tried the ones that had

00:05:50.699 --> 00:05:54.110 
at-at fries I tried the ones that had
two<00:05:51.449> jackhammers<00:05:52.289> and<00:05:52.789> honestly<00:05:53.789> these

00:05:54.110 --> 00:05:54.120 
two jackhammers and honestly these

00:05:54.120 --> 00:05:57.100 
two jackhammers and honestly these
actually<00:05:54.539> sound<00:05:54.780> the<00:05:54.900> loudest

00:05:57.100 --> 00:05:57.110 
actually sound the loudest

00:05:57.110 --> 00:05:59.689 
actually sound the loudest
I'd<00:05:58.110> say<00:05:58.440> Polk<00:05:58.979> Audio<00:05:59.130> would<00:05:59.370> sound<00:05:59.610> the

00:05:59.689 --> 00:05:59.699 
I'd say Polk Audio would sound the

00:05:59.699 --> 00:06:03.050 
I'd say Polk Audio would sound the
cleanest<00:06:00.410> kicker<00:06:01.410> it's<00:06:01.919> I<00:06:02.340> don't<00:06:02.639> know<00:06:02.729> just

00:06:03.050 --> 00:06:03.060 
cleanest kicker it's I don't know just

00:06:03.060 --> 00:06:05.570 
cleanest kicker it's I don't know just
to<00:06:03.419> me<00:06:03.599> I<00:06:03.810> don't<00:06:03.930> like<00:06:04.349> it<00:06:04.560> that<00:06:04.590> much<00:06:04.770> for<00:06:05.400> some

00:06:05.570 --> 00:06:05.580 
to me I don't like it that much for some

00:06:05.580 --> 00:06:07.520 
to me I don't like it that much for some
reason<00:06:05.910> you<00:06:06.690> know<00:06:06.780> I'm<00:06:06.870> not<00:06:06.990> saying<00:06:07.229> it's<00:06:07.320> bad

00:06:07.520 --> 00:06:07.530 
reason you know I'm not saying it's bad

00:06:07.530 --> 00:06:10.159 
reason you know I'm not saying it's bad
it's<00:06:07.919> just<00:06:08.160> not<00:06:08.340> my<00:06:08.669> kind<00:06:09.120> of<00:06:09.330> so<00:06:09.660> for<00:06:09.900> that<00:06:09.990> I

00:06:10.159 --> 00:06:10.169 
it's just not my kind of so for that I

00:06:10.169 --> 00:06:11.960 
it's just not my kind of so for that I
would<00:06:10.380> own<00:06:10.620> personally<00:06:11.250> I'd<00:06:11.400> either<00:06:11.520> pick<00:06:11.820> Ben

00:06:11.960 --> 00:06:11.970
