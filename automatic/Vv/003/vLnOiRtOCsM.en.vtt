hey<00:00:04.460> this<00:00:04.790> is<00:00:04.940> our<00:00:05.090> economist<00:00:05.600> speaking<00:00:05.960> today

00:00:06.550 --> 00:00:06.560 
hey this is our economist speaking today

00:00:06.560 --> 00:00:10.060 
hey this is our economist speaking today
I<00:00:06.710> was<00:00:07.340> gonna<00:00:07.609> share<00:00:07.880> with<00:00:08.059> you<00:00:08.559> my<00:00:09.559> approach

00:00:10.060 --> 00:00:10.070 
I was gonna share with you my approach

00:00:10.070 --> 00:00:13.330 
I was gonna share with you my approach
to<00:00:10.420> giving<00:00:11.420> more<00:00:11.720> melodic<00:00:12.080> content<00:00:12.710> to<00:00:12.950> like

00:00:13.330 --> 00:00:13.340 
to giving more melodic content to like

00:00:13.340 --> 00:00:16.359 
to giving more melodic content to like
you<00:00:13.970> know<00:00:14.090> more<00:00:14.269> generic<00:00:14.950> you<00:00:15.950> know<00:00:16.099> chord

00:00:16.359 --> 00:00:16.369 
you know more generic you know chord

00:00:16.369 --> 00:00:18.400 
you know more generic you know chord
strumming<00:00:16.730> type<00:00:17.060> rhythm<00:00:17.480> guitar<00:00:17.779> parts<00:00:18.140> so

00:00:18.400 --> 00:00:18.410 
strumming type rhythm guitar parts so

00:00:18.410 --> 00:00:20.890 
strumming type rhythm guitar parts so
we'll<00:00:19.340> take<00:00:19.550> this<00:00:19.910> you<00:00:20.480> know<00:00:20.599> fairly

00:00:20.890 --> 00:00:20.900 
we'll take this you know fairly

00:00:20.900 --> 00:00:41.780 
we'll take this you know fairly
straightforward<00:00:22.390> you<00:00:23.390> know<00:00:23.419> progression

00:00:41.780 --> 00:00:41.790 

00:00:41.790 --> 00:00:44.490 

so<00:00:42.790> when<00:00:43.030> you<00:00:43.150> do<00:00:43.300> something<00:00:43.330> like<00:00:43.840> that<00:00:44.080> in<00:00:44.350> a

00:00:44.490 --> 00:00:44.500 
so when you do something like that in a

00:00:44.500 --> 00:00:48.360 
so when you do something like that in a
band<00:00:44.770> context<00:00:45.580> what<00:00:46.060> happens<00:00:46.540> is<00:00:47.340> you<00:00:48.340> know

00:00:48.360 --> 00:00:48.370 
band context what happens is you know

00:00:48.370 --> 00:00:50.880 
band context what happens is you know
you<00:00:48.490> hear<00:00:48.970> the<00:00:49.240> chord<00:00:49.510> obviously<00:00:50.230> and<00:00:50.500> some<00:00:50.740> of

00:00:50.880 --> 00:00:50.890 
you hear the chord obviously and some of

00:00:50.890 --> 00:00:52.230 
you hear the chord obviously and some of
the<00:00:50.980> strumming<00:00:51.370> will<00:00:51.490> come<00:00:51.670> through<00:00:51.850> although

00:00:52.230 --> 00:00:52.240 
the strumming will come through although

00:00:52.240 --> 00:00:54.900 
the strumming will come through although
you<00:00:52.900> know<00:00:53.020> the<00:00:53.250> electric<00:00:54.250> iron<00:00:54.610> which

00:00:54.900 --> 00:00:54.910 
you know the electric iron which

00:00:54.910 --> 00:00:57.870 
you know the electric iron which
distortion<00:00:55.450> like<00:00:55.630> that<00:00:55.840> you<00:00:56.020> know<00:00:56.520> with<00:00:57.520> drums

00:00:57.870 --> 00:00:57.880 
distortion like that you know with drums

00:00:57.880 --> 00:00:59.970 
distortion like that you know with drums
and<00:00:58.150> stuff<00:00:58.450> attack<00:00:59.260> doesn't<00:00:59.530> come<00:00:59.770> through

00:00:59.970 --> 00:00:59.980 
and stuff attack doesn't come through

00:00:59.980 --> 00:01:02.400 
and stuff attack doesn't come through
that<00:01:00.100> much<00:01:00.310> so<00:01:00.520> you<00:01:00.580> get<00:01:00.820> a<00:01:00.850> bit<00:01:01.030> of<00:01:01.120> a<00:01:01.240> mosh<00:01:01.930> in

00:01:02.400 --> 00:01:02.410 
that much so you get a bit of a mosh in

00:01:02.410 --> 00:01:05.550 
that much so you get a bit of a mosh in
the<00:01:02.700> background<00:01:03.700> in<00:01:04.030> the<00:01:04.150> rhythm<00:01:04.560> Department

00:01:05.550 --> 00:01:05.560 
the background in the rhythm Department

00:01:05.560 --> 00:01:06.930 
the background in the rhythm Department
that's<00:01:05.740> just<00:01:05.950> kind<00:01:06.130> of<00:01:06.160> covers<00:01:06.460> up<00:01:06.670> a<00:01:06.700> lot<00:01:06.790> of

00:01:06.930 --> 00:01:06.940 
that's just kind of covers up a lot of

00:01:06.940 --> 00:01:11.550 
that's just kind of covers up a lot of
things<00:01:09.090> and<00:01:10.090> you<00:01:10.450> know<00:01:10.570> it<00:01:10.720> sounds<00:01:11.140> you<00:01:11.440> know

00:01:11.550 --> 00:01:11.560 
things and you know it sounds you know

00:01:11.560 --> 00:01:14.969 
things and you know it sounds you know
very<00:01:12.510> you<00:01:13.510> know<00:01:13.570> straightforward<00:01:14.350> or<00:01:14.530> or<00:01:14.920> I

00:01:14.969 --> 00:01:14.979 
very you know straightforward or or I

00:01:14.979 --> 00:01:18.630 
very you know straightforward or or I
would<00:01:15.790> say<00:01:15.970> boring<00:01:16.680> so<00:01:17.680> what<00:01:18.010> we<00:01:18.220> want<00:01:18.430> to<00:01:18.490> do

00:01:18.630 --> 00:01:18.640 
would say boring so what we want to do

00:01:18.640 --> 00:01:20.969 
would say boring so what we want to do
is<00:01:18.910> to<00:01:19.180> give<00:01:19.600> it<00:01:19.690> a<00:01:19.840> little<00:01:19.990> bit<00:01:20.170> more<00:01:20.380> distinct

00:01:20.969 --> 00:01:20.979 
is to give it a little bit more distinct

00:01:20.979 --> 00:01:23.160 
is to give it a little bit more distinct
melodic<00:01:21.490> element<00:01:21.940> to<00:01:22.090> this<00:01:22.240> part<00:01:22.660> so<00:01:23.140> that

00:01:23.160 --> 00:01:23.170 
melodic element to this part so that

00:01:23.170 --> 00:01:25.440 
melodic element to this part so that
it's<00:01:23.950> a<00:01:24.040> lot<00:01:24.220> more<00:01:24.460> interesting<00:01:25.000> to<00:01:25.030> listen<00:01:25.270> to

00:01:25.440 --> 00:01:25.450 
it's a lot more interesting to listen to

00:01:25.450 --> 00:01:28.109 
it's a lot more interesting to listen to
so<00:01:25.810> when<00:01:26.770> you<00:01:26.860> add<00:01:27.070> in<00:01:27.250> multi<00:01:27.550> content<00:01:28.030> the

00:01:28.109 --> 00:01:28.119 
so when you add in multi content the

00:01:28.119 --> 00:01:31.170 
so when you add in multi content the
first<00:01:28.150> thing<00:01:28.600> you<00:01:28.720> try<00:01:29.050> to<00:01:29.110> do<00:01:29.350> is<00:01:29.530> to<00:01:30.000> create<00:01:31.000> a

00:01:31.170 --> 00:01:31.180 
first thing you try to do is to create a

00:01:31.180 --> 00:01:34.230 
first thing you try to do is to create a
line<00:01:31.420> by<00:01:32.020> by<00:01:32.770> stringing<00:01:33.100> together<00:01:33.340> top<00:01:33.880> notes

00:01:34.230 --> 00:01:34.240 
line by by stringing together top notes

00:01:34.240 --> 00:01:37.680 
line by by stringing together top notes
of<00:01:34.540> these<00:01:34.810> chords<00:01:35.770> so<00:01:36.190> when<00:01:36.910> you<00:01:37.030> do<00:01:37.150> is<00:01:37.270> just<00:01:37.420> a

00:01:37.680 --> 00:01:37.690 
of these chords so when you do is just a

00:01:37.690 --> 00:01:45.900 
of these chords so when you do is just a
minor<00:01:43.200> but<00:01:44.200> you<00:01:44.830> know<00:01:44.980> it's<00:01:45.190> the<00:01:45.370> full<00:01:45.640> course

00:01:45.900 --> 00:01:45.910 
minor but you know it's the full course

00:01:45.910 --> 00:01:47.730 
minor but you know it's the full course
like<00:01:46.120> that<00:01:46.330> you're<00:01:46.510> really<00:01:46.660> not<00:01:46.780> hearing<00:01:47.590> that

00:01:47.730 --> 00:01:47.740 
like that you're really not hearing that

00:01:47.740 --> 00:01:49.740 
like that you're really not hearing that
top<00:01:48.010> now<00:01:48.220> it's<00:01:48.430> just<00:01:48.550> not<00:01:48.670> distinct<00:01:49.300> enough<00:01:49.510> so

00:01:49.740 --> 00:01:49.750 
top now it's just not distinct enough so

00:01:49.750 --> 00:01:52.710 
top now it's just not distinct enough so
I<00:01:49.960> could<00:01:50.410> try<00:01:50.590> adding<00:01:50.980> like<00:01:51.130> a<00:01:51.160> little<00:01:51.550> G<00:01:52.330> here

00:01:52.710 --> 00:01:52.720 
I could try adding like a little G here

00:01:52.720 --> 00:01:58.650 
I could try adding like a little G here
at<00:01:52.930> the<00:01:53.080> top<00:01:53.260> of<00:01:53.410> E<00:01:53.500> minor

00:01:58.650 --> 00:01:58.660 

00:01:58.660 --> 00:02:01.450 

okay<00:01:59.660> so<00:01:59.720> without<00:01:59.900> now-now<00:02:00.590> that<00:02:00.620> makes<00:02:01.070> it<00:02:01.220> G

00:02:01.450 --> 00:02:01.460 
okay so without now-now that makes it G

00:02:01.460 --> 00:02:03.580 
okay so without now-now that makes it G
F<00:02:01.670> sharp<00:02:01.700> to<00:02:02.210> e<00:02:02.240> so<00:02:02.810> that<00:02:03.020> you<00:02:03.140> know<00:02:03.230> has<00:02:03.350> a<00:02:03.380> nice

00:02:03.580 --> 00:02:03.590 
F sharp to e so that you know has a nice

00:02:03.590 --> 00:02:17.820 
F sharp to e so that you know has a nice
nicer<00:02:04.220> a<00:02:04.250> little<00:02:04.400> descending

00:02:17.820 --> 00:02:17.830 

00:02:17.830 --> 00:02:20.350 

but<00:02:18.830> you<00:02:19.160> know<00:02:19.280> when<00:02:19.430> you<00:02:19.520> strum<00:02:19.820> a<00:02:19.850> full<00:02:20.150> core

00:02:20.350 --> 00:02:20.360 
but you know when you strum a full core

00:02:20.360 --> 00:02:23.650 
but you know when you strum a full core
like<00:02:20.600> that<00:02:21.400> you<00:02:22.400> know<00:02:22.520> the<00:02:22.880> notes<00:02:23.060> still<00:02:23.510> kind

00:02:23.650 --> 00:02:23.660 
like that you know the notes still kind

00:02:23.660 --> 00:02:25.540 
like that you know the notes still kind
of<00:02:23.720> mushed<00:02:23.930> together<00:02:24.080> the<00:02:24.560> the<00:02:24.860> low<00:02:25.100> strings

00:02:25.540 --> 00:02:25.550 
of mushed together the the low strings

00:02:25.550 --> 00:02:27.640 
of mushed together the the low strings
overpower<00:02:26.180> the<00:02:26.360> high<00:02:26.510> string<00:02:26.900> so<00:02:27.140> your<00:02:27.290> top

00:02:27.640 --> 00:02:27.650 
overpower the high string so your top

00:02:27.650 --> 00:02:29.590 
overpower the high string so your top
note<00:02:27.920> really<00:02:28.250> doesn't<00:02:28.820> end<00:02:29.060> up<00:02:29.270> sort<00:02:29.510> of

00:02:29.590 --> 00:02:29.600 
note really doesn't end up sort of

00:02:29.600 --> 00:02:31.840 
note really doesn't end up sort of
coming<00:02:29.900> through<00:02:30.110> clearly<00:02:30.440> so<00:02:30.830> then<00:02:31.460> the<00:02:31.550> next

00:02:31.840 --> 00:02:31.850 
coming through clearly so then the next

00:02:31.850 --> 00:02:33.820 
coming through clearly so then the next
thing<00:02:31.940> I'll<00:02:32.150> you<00:02:32.570> know<00:02:32.690> look<00:02:32.870> into<00:02:33.080> is<00:02:33.380> to<00:02:33.620> cut

00:02:33.820 --> 00:02:33.830 
thing I'll you know look into is to cut

00:02:33.830 --> 00:02:35.350 
thing I'll you know look into is to cut
down<00:02:34.010> on<00:02:34.250> the<00:02:34.340> number<00:02:34.550> of<00:02:34.760> notes<00:02:35.000> that<00:02:35.270> I'm

00:02:35.350 --> 00:02:35.360 
down on the number of notes that I'm

00:02:35.360 --> 00:02:37.150 
down on the number of notes that I'm
playing<00:02:35.630> so<00:02:35.990> it's<00:02:36.140> a<00:02:36.260> lot<00:02:36.410> thinner<00:02:36.710> and<00:02:36.950> the

00:02:37.150 --> 00:02:37.160 
playing so it's a lot thinner and the

00:02:37.160 --> 00:02:38.560 
playing so it's a lot thinner and the
top<00:02:37.340> notes<00:02:37.550> come<00:02:37.820> through<00:02:38.030> clearly<00:02:38.180> so<00:02:38.540> I

00:02:38.560 --> 00:02:38.570 
top notes come through clearly so I

00:02:38.570 --> 00:02:40.630 
top notes come through clearly so I
could<00:02:38.840> play<00:02:38.990> the<00:02:39.110> same<00:02:39.290> thing<00:02:39.560> up<00:02:40.100> on<00:02:40.340> the<00:02:40.400> neck

00:02:40.630 --> 00:02:40.640 
could play the same thing up on the neck

00:02:40.640 --> 00:02:52.320 
could play the same thing up on the neck
right<00:02:41.060> here

00:02:52.320 --> 00:02:52.330 

00:02:52.330 --> 00:02:54.900 

so<00:02:53.320> now<00:02:53.530> you<00:02:53.590> hear<00:02:53.950> the<00:02:54.010> melody<00:02:54.430> more<00:02:54.610> clearly

00:02:54.900 --> 00:02:54.910 
so now you hear the melody more clearly

00:02:54.910 --> 00:02:58.760 
so now you hear the melody more clearly
now<00:02:55.060> and<00:02:55.420> since<00:02:56.380> you're<00:02:56.560> just<00:02:56.620> doing<00:02:57.130> two<00:02:57.670> note

00:02:58.760 --> 00:02:58.770 
now and since you're just doing two note

00:02:58.770 --> 00:03:01.590 
now and since you're just doing two note
approach<00:02:59.770> here<00:03:00.250> you<00:03:00.970> know<00:03:01.090> you<00:03:01.150> can<00:03:01.330> have<00:03:01.570> a

00:03:01.590 --> 00:03:01.600 
approach here you know you can have a

00:03:01.600 --> 00:03:03.180 
approach here you know you can have a
lot<00:03:01.810> more<00:03:01.840> freedom<00:03:02.170> to<00:03:02.380> just<00:03:02.500> move<00:03:02.710> around<00:03:02.980> a

00:03:03.180 --> 00:03:03.190 
lot more freedom to just move around a

00:03:03.190 --> 00:03:04.740 
lot more freedom to just move around a
little<00:03:03.310> bit<00:03:03.520> and<00:03:03.790> you<00:03:04.240> know<00:03:04.330> add<00:03:04.480> tension

00:03:04.740 --> 00:03:04.750 
little bit and you know add tension

00:03:04.750 --> 00:03:07.020 
little bit and you know add tension
notes<00:03:05.140> and<00:03:05.500> different<00:03:06.190> voicings<00:03:06.610> and<00:03:06.850> stuff

00:03:07.020 --> 00:03:07.030 
notes and different voicings and stuff

00:03:07.030 --> 00:03:30.010 
notes and different voicings and stuff
like<00:03:07.180> that<00:03:07.420> for<00:03:07.540> example<00:03:08.020> you<00:03:08.140> could<00:03:08.320> go

00:03:30.010 --> 00:03:30.020 

00:03:30.020 --> 00:03:32.900 

so<00:03:31.020> as<00:03:31.260> you<00:03:31.410> can<00:03:31.590> hear<00:03:31.890> I<00:03:31.920> just<00:03:32.520> played<00:03:32.760> around

so as you can hear I just played around

00:03:32.910 --> 00:03:34.850 
so as you can hear I just played around
