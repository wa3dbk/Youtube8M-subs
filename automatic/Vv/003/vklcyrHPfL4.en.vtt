day and the NFL Combine and the way that
we<00:01:43.079> do<00:01:43.290> that<00:01:43.320> is<00:01:43.590> that<00:01:44.040> we<00:01:44.280> prepare<00:01:44.880> them<00:01:45.090> by

00:01:45.530 --> 00:01:45.540 
we do that is that we prepare them by

00:01:50.539 --> 00:01:50.549 
over so it becomes automatic so when

00:01:50.549 --> 00:01:52.039 
over so it becomes automatic so when
they<00:01:50.640> get<00:01:50.759> out<00:01:50.820> there<00:01:51.210> they<00:01:51.689> don't<00:01:51.840> have<00:01:51.899> to
