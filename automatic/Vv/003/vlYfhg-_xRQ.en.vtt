00:00:06.840 --> 00:00:09.570 

okay<00:00:07.840> today<00:00:08.170> we're<00:00:08.620> going<00:00:08.710> to<00:00:08.800> do<00:00:08.889> a<00:00:08.920> video<00:00:09.190> on

00:00:09.570 --> 00:00:09.580 
okay today we're going to do a video on

00:00:09.580 --> 00:00:15.090 
okay today we're going to do a video on
our<00:00:10.090> variable<00:00:10.480> V<00:00:10.600> system<00:00:11.080> on<00:00:11.400> T<00:00:12.400> trim<00:00:12.670> vortech

00:00:15.090 --> 00:00:15.100 
our variable V system on T trim vortech

00:00:15.100 --> 00:00:17.940 
our variable V system on T trim vortech
we've<00:00:15.700> actually<00:00:15.880> got<00:00:16.150> a<00:00:16.530> switch<00:00:17.530> on<00:00:17.680> the<00:00:17.770> dash

00:00:17.940 --> 00:00:17.950 
we've actually got a switch on the dash

00:00:17.950 --> 00:00:20.550 
we've actually got a switch on the dash
which<00:00:18.820> gives<00:00:19.090> us<00:00:19.210> a<00:00:19.270> fire<00:00:19.660> and<00:00:19.960> live<00:00:20.110> position

00:00:20.550 --> 00:00:20.560 
which gives us a fire and live position

00:00:20.560 --> 00:00:23.460 
which gives us a fire and live position
for<00:00:21.280> our<00:00:21.460> booth<00:00:22.060> settings<00:00:22.450> so<00:00:22.900> we'll<00:00:23.080> go<00:00:23.200> run

00:00:23.460 --> 00:00:23.470 
for our booth settings so we'll go run

00:00:23.470 --> 00:00:26.220 
for our booth settings so we'll go run
to<00:00:23.650> a<00:00:23.680> video<00:00:24.010> to<00:00:24.550> show<00:00:24.820> you<00:00:24.850> the<00:00:25.510> different

00:00:26.220 --> 00:00:26.230 
to a video to show you the different

00:00:26.230 --> 00:01:37.520 
to a video to show you the different
pair<00:00:26.410> and<00:00:26.619> a<00:00:26.680> bit<00:00:26.830> different<00:00:27.100> boost<00:00:27.250> levels

00:01:37.520 --> 00:01:37.530 

00:01:37.530 --> 00:01:39.929 

it's<00:01:38.530> the<00:01:38.649> character<00:01:38.829> we're<00:01:39.520> going<00:01:39.670> to<00:01:39.759> graph

00:01:39.929 --> 00:01:39.939 
it's the character we're going to graph

00:01:39.939 --> 00:01:41.940 
it's the character we're going to graph
here<00:01:40.149> and<00:01:41.079> we'll<00:01:41.259> be<00:01:41.289> coming<00:01:41.500> over<00:01:41.619> to<00:01:41.799> look<00:01:41.859> at

00:01:41.940 --> 00:01:41.950 
here and we'll be coming over to look at

00:01:41.950 --> 00:01:44.370 
here and we'll be coming over to look at
the<00:01:42.009> screen<00:01:42.280> you<00:01:42.579> see<00:01:43.570> we've<00:01:43.899> got<00:01:44.020> this<00:01:44.200> is<00:01:44.289> the

00:01:44.370 --> 00:01:44.380 
the screen you see we've got this is the

00:01:44.380 --> 00:01:47.279 
the screen you see we've got this is the
horsepower<00:01:44.740> graph<00:01:45.250> on<00:01:45.399> the<00:01:45.490> top<00:01:45.670> here<00:01:45.880> and<00:01:46.750> you

00:01:47.279 --> 00:01:47.289 
horsepower graph on the top here and you

00:01:47.289 --> 00:01:49.859 
horsepower graph on the top here and you
can<00:01:47.679> see<00:01:47.859> that<00:01:48.069> the<00:01:48.310> higher<00:01:48.789> boost<00:01:49.329> one<00:01:49.659> we

00:01:49.859 --> 00:01:49.869 
can see that the higher boost one we

00:01:49.869 --> 00:01:52.200 
can see that the higher boost one we
ended<00:01:50.079> up<00:01:50.200> with<00:01:50.380> a<00:01:50.409> full<00:01:50.770> power<00:01:51.009> of<00:01:51.039> like<00:01:52.030> just

00:01:52.200 --> 00:01:52.210 
ended up with a full power of like just

00:01:52.210 --> 00:01:56.459 
ended up with a full power of like just
under<00:01:52.560> 575<00:01:53.700> and<00:01:54.700> our<00:01:55.030> low<00:01:55.329> boost<00:01:55.600> we<00:01:56.170> really

00:01:56.459 --> 00:01:56.469 
under 575 and our low boost we really

00:01:56.469 --> 00:02:00.719 
under 575 and our low boost we really
saw<00:01:56.619> max<00:01:56.860> power<00:01:57.100> of<00:01:57.429> the<00:01:57.640> 481<00:01:58.479> for<00:01:59.399> 490<00:02:00.399> is

00:02:00.719 --> 00:02:00.729 
saw max power of the 481 for 490 is

00:02:00.729 --> 00:02:03.059 
saw max power of the 481 for 490 is
roughly<00:02:01.000> what<00:02:01.179> we<00:02:01.209> see<00:02:01.479> for<00:02:01.899> our<00:02:02.079> low<00:02:02.350> boost<00:02:02.619> as

00:02:03.059 --> 00:02:03.069 
roughly what we see for our low boost as

00:02:03.069 --> 00:02:05.069 
roughly what we see for our low boost as
you<00:02:03.490> can<00:02:03.609> see<00:02:03.789> down<00:02:04.630> on<00:02:04.659> the<00:02:04.780> bottom<00:02:04.840> here

00:02:05.069 --> 00:02:05.079 
you can see down on the bottom here

00:02:05.079 --> 00:02:07.679 
you can see down on the bottom here
we've<00:02:05.439> got<00:02:05.590> our<00:02:05.740> boost<00:02:05.979> curves<00:02:06.479> and<00:02:07.479> we've

00:02:07.679 --> 00:02:07.689 
we've got our boost curves and we've

00:02:07.689 --> 00:02:10.410 
we've got our boost curves and we've
actually<00:02:07.840> got<00:02:08.229> full<00:02:09.099> boost<00:02:09.310> all<00:02:10.119> the<00:02:10.299> way

00:02:10.410 --> 00:02:10.420 
actually got full boost all the way

00:02:10.420 --> 00:02:12.750 
actually got full boost all the way
through<00:02:10.660> up<00:02:10.810> until<00:02:11.069> around<00:02:12.069> about<00:02:12.370> the<00:02:12.549> four

00:02:12.750 --> 00:02:12.760 
through up until around about the four

00:02:12.760 --> 00:02:14.640 
through up until around about the four
and<00:02:12.849> a<00:02:12.880> half<00:02:12.940> thousand<00:02:13.360> rpm<00:02:13.450> I<00:02:13.959> haven't<00:02:14.470> got<00:02:14.560> it

00:02:14.640 --> 00:02:14.650 
and a half thousand rpm I haven't got it

00:02:14.650 --> 00:02:16.140 
and a half thousand rpm I haven't got it
scaled<00:02:14.920> on<00:02:15.099> this<00:02:15.250> graph<00:02:15.459> at<00:02:15.579> the<00:02:15.610> moment<00:02:15.970> and

00:02:16.140 --> 00:02:16.150 
scaled on this graph at the moment and

00:02:16.150 --> 00:02:18.000 
scaled on this graph at the moment and
then<00:02:16.870> we're<00:02:17.049> actually<00:02:17.140> starting<00:02:17.680> to<00:02:17.709> control

00:02:18.000 --> 00:02:18.010 
then we're actually starting to control

00:02:18.010 --> 00:02:19.740 
then we're actually starting to control
our<00:02:18.190> boosts<00:02:18.370> we<00:02:18.819> actually<00:02:19.120> are<00:02:19.209> controlling

00:02:19.740 --> 00:02:19.750 
our boosts we actually are controlling

00:02:19.750 --> 00:02:23.130 
our boosts we actually are controlling
it<00:02:19.840> at<00:02:20.709> just<00:02:21.310> on<00:02:21.549> 11<00:02:22.420> pounds<00:02:22.720> of<00:02:22.810> boost<00:02:22.900> as

00:02:23.130 --> 00:02:23.140 
it at just on 11 pounds of boost as

00:02:23.140 --> 00:02:25.080 
it at just on 11 pounds of boost as
we're<00:02:23.319> actually<00:02:23.620> controlling<00:02:23.950> our<00:02:24.160> boost<00:02:24.340> and

00:02:25.080 --> 00:02:25.090 
we're actually controlling our boost and

00:02:25.090 --> 00:02:27.660 
we're actually controlling our boost and
that's<00:02:25.329> why<00:02:25.540> we're<00:02:25.959> seeing<00:02:26.260> the<00:02:26.829> change<00:02:27.190> where

00:02:27.660 --> 00:02:27.670 
that's why we're seeing the change where

00:02:27.670 --> 00:02:28.710 
that's why we're seeing the change where
we're<00:02:27.819> just<00:02:27.849> not<00:02:28.180> pushing<00:02:28.420> the<00:02:28.569> full

00:02:28.710 --> 00:02:28.720 
we're just not pushing the full

00:02:28.720 --> 00:02:31.559 
we're just not pushing the full
horsepower<00:02:29.110> it<00:02:29.829> gives<00:02:30.040> you<00:02:30.250> the<00:02:30.910> full<00:02:31.090> boosted

00:02:31.559 --> 00:02:31.569 
horsepower it gives you the full boosted

00:02:31.569 --> 00:02:33.900 
horsepower it gives you the full boosted
bottom<00:02:32.019> end<00:02:32.170> of<00:02:32.349> your<00:02:32.440> power<00:02:32.829> curve<00:02:33.129> and<00:02:33.400> yet

00:02:33.900 --> 00:02:33.910 
bottom end of your power curve and yet

00:02:33.910 --> 00:02:36.150 
bottom end of your power curve and yet
we're<00:02:34.120> also<00:02:34.269> seeing<00:02:34.750> a<00:02:35.049> stable<00:02:35.739> boost<00:02:35.920> curve

00:02:36.150 --> 00:02:36.160 
we're also seeing a stable boost curve

00:02:36.160 --> 00:02:38.610 
we're also seeing a stable boost curve
at<00:02:36.280> the<00:02:36.400> top
