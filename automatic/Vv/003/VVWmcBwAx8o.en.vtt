00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.730
 hello here is the georg naturell 

00:00:02.730 --> 00:00:08.099
 therapist water coach you know on 

00:00:05.730 --> 00:00:10.889
 the endless debate whether that was something 

00:00:08.099 --> 00:00:11.759
 acidic neutral or basic ph value 

00:00:10.889 --> 00:00:14.309
 should have 

00:00:11.759 --> 00:00:16.740
 in the last time is very often of 

00:00:14.309 --> 00:00:18.869
 basic water is spoken yet 

00:00:16.740 --> 00:00:21.830
 This water is so perfect for 

00:00:18.869 --> 00:00:24.750
 our body as well as it is touted 

00:00:21.830 --> 00:00:26.730
 my wife marie theres is a graduate 

00:00:24.750 --> 00:00:29.210
 nurse and deals 

00:00:26.730 --> 00:00:32.070
 already ten years with vidal 

00:00:29.210 --> 00:00:34.079
 healthy water they had 

00:00:32.070 --> 00:00:36.480
 wrote an e book about this topic 

00:00:34.079 --> 00:00:40.010
 that you are free from ours 

00:00:36.480 --> 00:00:43.260
 homepage www weserwasser punkt at 

00:00:40.010 --> 00:00:46.500
 you can download this we have 

00:00:43.260 --> 00:00:49.649
 luck in 2004 with other water 

00:00:46.500 --> 00:00:52.920
 Research on the ideal spring water 

00:00:49.649 --> 00:00:54.809
 search and with all sources as then 

00:00:52.920 --> 00:00:58.340
 classified as health-promoting 

00:00:54.809 --> 00:01:02.570
 the ph value was passed 

00:00:58.340 --> 00:01:04.939
 So easily looked up to neutral area 

00:01:02.570 --> 00:01:07.590
 not a single basis 

00:01:04.939 --> 00:01:10.549
 We have this search last year 

00:01:07.590 --> 00:01:13.560
 repeated and some so-called sacred 

00:01:10.549 --> 00:01:14.159
 analyze sources at the uni graz 

00:01:13.560 --> 00:01:17.369
 to let 

00:01:14.159 --> 00:01:20.270
 all really all had a ph value 

00:01:17.369 --> 00:01:23.100
 under 68 

00:01:20.270 --> 00:01:25.259
 We believe that it is important 

00:01:23.100 --> 00:01:28.890
 to add water to our body 

00:01:25.259 --> 00:01:30.799
 that nature corresponds to basic 

00:01:28.890 --> 00:01:33.600
 We could not find water 

00:01:30.799 --> 00:01:36.900
 that our normal tap water a 

00:01:33.600 --> 00:01:40.310
 ph value over 7 is due 

00:01:36.900 --> 00:01:43.079
 that the water is either very much 

00:01:40.310 --> 00:01:46.770
 contains inorganic minerals or 

00:01:43.079 --> 00:01:49.829
 as well as very often in the case is the bhw 

00:01:46.770 --> 00:01:51.960
 artificially lifted up there is the 

00:01:49.829 --> 00:01:55.049
 otherwise in case of water 

00:01:51.960 --> 00:01:58.110
 it would have to communicate in germany 

00:01:55.049 --> 00:01:59.870
 eg with installed copper pipes of the bhw 

00:01:58.110 --> 00:02:02.880
 over 73 

00:01:59.870 --> 00:02:05.430
 if the ph value is lower, more 

00:02:02.880 --> 00:02:08.750
 I would threaten to stand in at the time 

00:02:05.430 --> 00:02:09.950
 the poisonous copper in man 

00:02:08.750 --> 00:02:13.080
 hazardous quantities 

00:02:09.950 --> 00:02:15.480
 to be liberated there are at the 

00:02:13.080 --> 00:02:16.760
 water plants several methods to ph 

00:02:15.480 --> 00:02:20.100
 worth raising 

00:02:16.760 --> 00:02:23.640
 Among other things, is about dosing 

00:02:20.100 --> 00:02:27.930
 sodium hydroxide solution is added to the ph value 

00:02:23.640 --> 00:02:29.940
 over seven increases with natural nature 

00:02:27.930 --> 00:02:33.080
 we are in such a situation 

00:02:29.940 --> 00:02:36.570
 of course, far away 

00:02:33.080 --> 00:02:39.570
 You can find more in our free 

00:02:36.570 --> 00:02:42.030
 ebook five facts about water filters 

00:02:39.570 --> 00:02:43.530
 I would be happy if I could yours 

00:02:42.030 --> 00:02:47.750
 have aroused interest 

00:02:43.530 --> 00:02:47.750
