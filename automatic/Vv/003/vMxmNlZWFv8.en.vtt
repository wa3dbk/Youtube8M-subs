00:01:22.070 --> 00:01:22.080 
of the test server is the t54 so let's

00:01:22.080 --> 00:01:47.210 
of the test server is the t54 so let's
take<00:01:22.200> a<00:01:22.230> look<00:01:22.440> at<00:01:22.530> that

00:01:47.210 --> 00:01:47.220 

00:01:47.220 --> 00:01:49.170 

another<00:01:48.220> thing<00:01:48.490> that<00:01:48.520> I<00:01:48.700> have<00:01:48.850> noticed

00:01:50.880 --> 00:01:50.890 
immediately is that the system's general

00:01:50.890 --> 00:01:52.800 
immediately is that the system's general
in<00:01:51.010> the<00:01:51.100> bottom<00:01:51.370> right<00:01:51.520> is<00:01:51.550> gone<00:01:51.910> and<00:01:52.090> you<00:01:52.690> now
