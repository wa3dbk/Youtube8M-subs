get a proper stretch for the Shaolin

00:02:49.359 --> 00:02:52.879

this<00:02:53.889> kick<00:02:54.220> is<00:02:54.250> pretty<00:02:54.760> much<00:02:54.939> exactly<00:02:55.180> how<00:02:55.629> it

00:02:55.979 --> 00:02:55.989 
this kick is pretty much exactly how it

00:02:55.989 --> 00:02:58.890 
this kick is pretty much exactly how it
looks<00:02:56.370> but<00:02:57.370> the<00:02:57.579> key<00:02:57.760> to<00:02:57.790> gaining<00:02:58.090> flexibility

00:02:58.890 --> 00:02:58.900 
looks but the key to gaining flexibility

00:02:58.900 --> 00:03:00.899

lies<00:02:59.530> in<00:02:59.709> keeping<00:02:59.980> your<00:03:00.129> back<00:03:00.310> as<00:03:00.549> straight<00:03:00.579> as

lies in keeping your back as straight as
possible<00:03:00.939> a<00:03:06.659> lot<00:03:07.659> of<00:03:07.689> people<00:03:08.109> will<00:03:08.169> tend<00:03:08.379> to

00:03:08.460 --> 00:03:08.470 
possible a lot of people will tend to

00:03:08.470 --> 00:03:10.800 
possible a lot of people will tend to
subconsciously<00:03:08.919> lean<00:03:09.400> forward<00:03:09.879> which

00:03:10.800 --> 00:03:10.810 
subconsciously lean forward which

00:03:10.810 --> 00:03:12.240 
subconsciously lean forward which
inhibits<00:03:11.260> them<00:03:11.439> from<00:03:11.680> gaining<00:03:11.859> more

00:03:12.240 --> 00:03:12.250 
inhibits them from gaining more

00:03:12.250 --> 00:03:15.990 
inhibits them from gaining more
flexibility<00:03:12.849> a<00:03:14.129> trick<00:03:15.129> I<00:03:15.280> figured<00:03:15.609> out<00:03:15.790> to

00:03:15.990 --> 00:03:16.000 
flexibility a trick I figured out to

00:03:16.000 --> 00:03:18.119 
flexibility a trick I figured out to
overcome<00:03:16.449> the<00:03:16.569> tendency<00:03:17.079> is<00:03:17.349> to<00:03:17.709> lean<00:03:18.040> your

00:03:18.119 --> 00:03:18.129 
overcome the tendency is to lean your

00:03:18.129 --> 00:03:21.360 
overcome the tendency is to lean your
back<00:03:18.340> backwards<00:03:18.639> at<00:03:19.209> the<00:03:19.329> start<00:03:19.569> of<00:03:19.599> the<00:03:19.690> cake

00:03:21.360 --> 00:03:21.370 
back backwards at the start of the cake

00:03:21.370 --> 00:03:24.000 
back backwards at the start of the cake
this<00:03:22.090> way<00:03:22.330> you<00:03:22.930> will<00:03:22.989> naturally<00:03:23.170> go<00:03:23.530> into<00:03:23.980> a

00:03:24.000 --> 00:03:24.010 
this way you will naturally go into a

00:03:24.010 --> 00:03:25.619 
this way you will naturally go into a
straight<00:03:24.310> position<00:03:24.459> as<00:03:25.030> you<00:03:25.120> perform<00:03:25.299> the

00:03:25.619 --> 00:03:25.629 
straight position as you perform the

00:03:25.629 --> 00:03:37.259 
straight position as you perform the
cake<00:03:34.709> keep<00:03:35.709> in<00:03:35.920> mind<00:03:35.950> that<00:03:36.370> this<00:03:36.700> kick<00:03:36.940> is<00:03:36.970> not

00:03:37.259 --> 00:03:37.269 
cake keep in mind that this kick is not

00:03:37.269 --> 00:03:40.530 
cake keep in mind that this kick is not
a<00:03:37.299> snapping<00:03:37.780> motion<00:03:38.790> since<00:03:39.790> the<00:03:39.909> goal<00:03:40.120> is<00:03:40.360> to

00:03:40.530 --> 00:03:40.540 
a snapping motion since the goal is to

00:03:40.540 --> 00:03:42.479 
a snapping motion since the goal is to
get<00:03:40.659> more<00:03:40.780> flexible<00:03:41.379> you<00:03:41.950> want<00:03:42.129> to<00:03:42.220> keep<00:03:42.370> your

00:03:42.479 --> 00:03:42.489 
get more flexible you want to keep your

00:03:42.489 --> 00:03:43.949 
get more flexible you want to keep your
leg<00:03:42.670> as<00:03:42.790> straight<00:03:42.819> as<00:03:43.180> possible<00:03:43.209> we're

00:03:43.949 --> 00:03:43.959 
leg as straight as possible we're

00:03:43.959 --> 00:03:50.009 
leg as straight as possible we're
performing<00:03:44.349> the<00:03:44.500> stretch<00:03:48.540> using<00:03:49.540> the<00:03:49.690> tekmoto

00:03:50.009 --> 00:03:50.019 
performing the stretch using the tekmoto

00:03:50.019 --> 00:03:52.559 
performing the stretch using the tekmoto
method<00:03:50.620> one<00:03:51.430> should<00:03:51.610> first<00:03:51.849> perform<00:03:52.269> a<00:03:52.390> set

00:03:52.559 --> 00:03:52.569 
method one should first perform a set

00:03:52.569 --> 00:03:54.900 
method one should first perform a set
amount<00:03:52.690> of<00:03:52.900> kicks<00:03:53.140> on<00:03:53.290> one<00:03:53.440> side<00:03:53.769> and<00:03:54.099> then

00:03:54.900 --> 00:03:54.910 
amount of kicks on one side and then

00:03:54.910 --> 00:03:56.550 
amount of kicks on one side and then
switch<00:03:55.180> legs<00:03:55.209> to<00:03:55.780> perform<00:03:56.170> the<00:03:56.290> same<00:03:56.440> amount

00:03:56.550 --> 00:03:56.560 
switch legs to perform the same amount

00:03:56.560 --> 00:04:01.500

00:04:01.500 --> 00:04:01.510 

00:04:01.510 --> 00:04:06.660 

I<00:04:04.260> recommend<00:04:05.260> performing<00:04:05.470> five<00:04:06.040> to<00:04:06.220> ten<00:04:06.400> kicks

00:04:06.660 --> 00:04:06.670 
I recommend performing five to ten kicks

00:04:06.670 --> 00:04:15.330 
I recommend performing five to ten kicks
for<00:04:06.879> each<00:04:07.000> leg<00:04:12.780> for<00:04:13.780> the<00:04:13.810> Shaolin<00:04:14.260> method<00:04:14.680> one

00:04:15.330 --> 00:04:15.340 
for each leg for the Shaolin method one

00:04:15.340 --> 00:04:16.710 
for each leg for the Shaolin method one
should<00:04:15.489> alternate<00:04:15.879> kicks<00:04:16.180> while<00:04:16.389> moving

00:04:16.710 --> 00:04:16.720 
should alternate kicks while moving

00:04:16.720 --> 00:04:21.920 
should alternate kicks while moving
forwards<00:04:17.169> in<00:04:17.290> a<00:04:17.320> straight<00:04:17.560> line<00:04:17.590> like<00:04:18.070> so<00:04:18.250> I

00:04:21.920 --> 00:04:21.930 

00:04:21.930 --> 00:04:24.659 

recommend<00:04:22.930> performing<00:04:23.440> ten<00:04:23.919> kicks<00:04:24.220> each<00:04:24.430> way

00:04:24.659 --> 00:04:24.669 
recommend performing ten kicks each way

00:04:24.669 --> 00:04:39.090 
recommend performing ten kicks each way
for<00:04:25.270> a<00:04:25.300> total<00:04:25.600> of<00:04:25.690> 20<00:04:26.020> gigs<00:04:37.380> at<00:04:38.380> first<00:04:38.740> you

00:04:39.090 --> 00:04:39.100 
for a total of 20 gigs at first you

00:04:39.100 --> 00:04:40.590 
for a total of 20 gigs at first you
might<00:04:39.250> not<00:04:39.400> be<00:04:39.520> able<00:04:39.610> to<00:04:39.789> kick<00:04:39.970> very<00:04:40.180> high<00:04:40.360> and

00:04:40.590 --> 00:04:40.600 
might not be able to kick very high and

00:04:40.600 --> 00:04:44.010 
might not be able to kick very high and
that's<00:04:41.080> okay<00:04:42.510> just<00:04:43.510> keep<00:04:43.660> pushing<00:04:43.720> yourself

00:04:44.010 --> 00:04:44.020 
that's okay just keep pushing yourself

00:04:44.020 --> 00:04:46.320 
that's okay just keep pushing yourself
every<00:04:44.889> time<00:04:44.919> and<00:04:45.430> you'll<00:04:45.699> be<00:04:45.850> able<00:04:45.910> to<00:04:46.150> kick

00:04:46.320 --> 00:04:46.330 
every time and you'll be able to kick

00:04:46.330 --> 00:04:52.560
