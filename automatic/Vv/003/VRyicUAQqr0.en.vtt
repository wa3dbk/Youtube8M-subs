00:01:01.029 --> 00:01:01.039 
your duct tape and then cut off a bit

00:01:01.039 --> 00:01:05.870 
your duct tape and then cut off a bit
about<00:01:02.039> there<00:01:03.979> so<00:01:04.979> you'll<00:01:05.129> see<00:01:05.309> like<00:01:05.430> that<00:01:05.640> not

00:01:05.870 --> 00:01:05.880 
about there so you'll see like that not

00:01:13.950 --> 00:01:16.880 
basically you roll towards the black
side<00:01:14.280> so<00:01:14.939> stick<00:01:15.479> the<00:01:15.780> sticky<00:01:16.229> bit<00:01:16.380> side<00:01:16.710> on

00:01:16.880 --> 00:01:16.890 
side so stick the sticky bit side on

00:01:16.890 --> 00:01:17.570

00:01:20.400 --> 00:01:23.660 
and start rolling towards the black bear
not<00:01:21.210> so<00:01:21.479> that<00:01:21.659> the<00:01:21.840> sticky<00:01:22.409> bit<00:01:22.590> on<00:01:22.799> is<00:01:23.340> on<00:01:23.640> the

00:01:23.660 --> 00:01:23.670 
not so that the sticky bit on is on the

00:01:23.670 --> 00:01:27.380 
not so that the sticky bit on is on the
outside<00:01:24.330> of<00:01:24.659> the<00:01:25.189> duct<00:01:26.189> tape<00:01:26.280> so<00:01:26.759> you'll<00:01:27.180> end

00:01:27.380 --> 00:01:27.390 
outside of the duct tape so you'll end

00:01:27.390 --> 00:01:30.410 
outside of the duct tape so you'll end
up<00:01:27.540> with<00:01:28.290> something<00:01:28.590> looking<00:01:28.770> like<00:01:28.950> this<00:01:29.420> and

00:01:30.410 --> 00:01:30.420

00:01:32.210 --> 00:01:32.220 
you roll diagonally to make it have the

00:01:32.220 --> 00:01:36.499 
you roll diagonally to make it have the
like<00:01:32.759> drill<00:01:33.150> like<00:01:33.950> lip<00:01:34.950> and<00:01:35.939> then<00:01:36.000> basically

00:01:36.499 --> 00:01:36.509 
like drill like lip and then basically

00:01:36.509 --> 00:01:40.700 
like drill like lip and then basically
put<00:01:36.840> it<00:01:36.960> into<00:01:37.259> your<00:01:38.630> ipod<00:01:39.630> turn<00:01:40.259> it<00:01:40.380> around<00:01:40.470> a

00:01:46.219 --> 00:01:46.229 
bit and then i've really cleaned out

00:01:46.229 --> 00:01:50.080 
bit and then i've really cleaned out
this<00:01:46.439> ipod<00:01:46.950> but<00:01:47.880> you<00:01:48.750> can't<00:01:49.020> really<00:01:49.200> see<00:01:49.590> it

00:01:50.080 --> 00:01:50.090

or to client back to you saying what the
problem<00:02:16.719> isn't<00:02:16.870> trying<00:02:17.680> to<00:02:17.829> help<00:02:18.189> you<00:02:18.430> so<00:02:18.939> yeah

00:02:19.020 --> 00:02:19.030 
problem isn't trying to help you so yeah

00:02:19.030 --> 00:02:20.910 
problem isn't trying to help you so yeah
I<00:02:19.060> remember<00:02:19.180> just<00:02:19.569> don't<00:02:19.989> tape<00:02:20.230> roll<00:02:20.769> it

00:02:20.910 --> 00:02:20.920 
I remember just don't tape roll it

00:02:20.920 --> 00:02:21.860 
I remember just don't tape roll it
around<00:02:20.980> the<00:02:21.159> other<00:02:21.280> way

00:02:21.860 --> 00:02:21.870 
around the other way

00:02:21.870 --> 00:02:26.399 
around the other way
stick<00:02:22.870> it<00:02:23.019> into<00:02:23.139> your<00:02:23.519> jack<00:02:24.519> and<00:02:24.819> yeah<00:02:25.629> but<00:02:26.319> the

00:02:26.399 --> 00:02:26.409 
stick it into your jack and yeah but the

00:02:26.409 --> 00:02:27.720 
stick it into your jack and yeah but the
reason<00:02:26.709> you<00:02:26.739> do<00:02:26.980> it<00:02:27.040> this<00:02:27.159> way<00:02:27.370> and<00:02:27.489> not<00:02:27.579> any

00:02:27.720 --> 00:02:27.730 
reason you do it this way and not any

00:02:27.730 --> 00:02:29.160 
reason you do it this way and not any
other<00:02:27.790> way<00:02:28.090> is<00:02:28.359> because<00:02:28.510> if<00:02:28.870> you've<00:02:28.989> got<00:02:29.019> a

00:02:29.160 --> 00:02:29.170 
other way is because if you've got a

00:02:29.170 --> 00:02:31.459 
other way is because if you've got a
cracked<00:02:29.409> screen<00:02:29.650> like<00:02:29.829> this<00:02:30.010> I<00:02:30.310> put<00:02:31.090> those

00:02:31.459 --> 00:02:31.469 
cracked screen like this I put those

00:02:31.469 --> 00:02:34.860 
cracked screen like this I put those
then<00:02:32.469> you<00:02:32.620> can't<00:02:32.859> use<00:02:32.920> the<00:02:33.250> LCD<00:02:33.579> plaka<00:02:34.299> to<00:02:34.689> take

00:02:34.860 --> 00:02:34.870 
then you can't use the LCD plaka to take

00:02:34.870 --> 00:02:36.809 
then you can't use the LCD plaka to take
out<00:02:35.079> and<00:02:35.319> then<00:02:35.439> clean<00:02:35.680> it<00:02:35.799> out<00:02:35.920> and<00:02:36.159> then<00:02:36.609> also

00:02:36.809 --> 00:02:36.819 
out and then clean it out and then also

00:02:36.819 --> 00:02:38.280 
out and then clean it out and then also
what's<00:02:37.060> bad<00:02:37.209> about<00:02:37.239> that<00:02:37.420> is<00:02:37.689> debris<00:02:37.959> gets

00:02:38.280 --> 00:02:38.290 
what's bad about that is debris gets

00:02:38.290 --> 00:02:40.470 
what's bad about that is debris gets
into<00:02:38.650> circuitry<00:02:39.609> which<00:02:39.730> can<00:02:39.939> then

00:02:40.470 --> 00:02:40.480 
into circuitry which can then

00:02:40.480 --> 00:02:43.589 
into circuitry which can then
malfunction<00:02:41.169> it<00:02:41.319> and<00:02:41.530> it<00:02:41.859> also<00:02:42.480> what's<00:02:43.480> it

00:02:43.589 --> 00:02:43.599 
malfunction it and it also what's it

00:02:43.599 --> 00:02:46.619 
malfunction it and it also what's it
called<00:02:44.099> expires<00:02:45.099> your<00:02:45.310> warranty<00:02:45.730> but

00:02:46.619 --> 00:02:46.629 
called expires your warranty but

00:02:46.629 --> 00:02:48.780 
called expires your warranty but
basically<00:02:47.139> it<00:02:47.889> costs<00:02:48.129> something<00:02:48.280> like<00:02:48.430> 50

00:02:48.780 --> 00:02:48.790 
basically it costs something like 50

00:02:48.790 --> 00:02:50.940 
basically it costs something like 50
quid<00:02:48.969> for<00:02:49.000> them<00:02:49.209> to<00:02:49.359> replace<00:02:49.629> it<00:02:49.900> so<00:02:50.829> it's

00:02:50.940 --> 00:02:50.950 
quid for them to replace it so it's

00:02:50.950 --> 00:02:52.289 
quid for them to replace it so it's
really<00:02:51.129> not<00:02:51.280> worth<00:02:51.489> it<00:02:51.639> when<00:02:51.790> you<00:02:51.819> can<00:02:52.030> just<00:02:52.120> do

00:02:52.289 --> 00:02:52.299 
really not worth it when you can just do

00:02:52.299 --> 00:02:53.849 
really not worth it when you can just do
such<00:02:52.510> a<00:02:52.540> little<00:02:52.780> thing<00:02:52.959> like<00:02:53.019> by<00:02:53.379> duct<00:02:53.620> tape

00:02:53.849 --> 00:02:53.859 
such a little thing like by duct tape

00:02:53.859 --> 00:02:56.759 
such a little thing like by duct tape
and<00:02:54.129> just<00:02:54.370> spin<00:02:54.699> it<00:02:54.819> in<00:02:54.939> so<00:02:55.480> yeah<00:02:55.629> ii<00:02:56.290> had<00:02:56.439> six

00:02:56.759 --> 00:02:56.769 
and just spin it in so yeah ii had six
