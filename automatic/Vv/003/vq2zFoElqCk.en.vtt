00:00:09.540 --> 00:00:14.160
 discovery of the clearly corrective line 

00:00:11.940 --> 00:00:16.410
 white that is part of the world 

00:00:14.160 --> 00:00:18.840
 dermatologic solutions a line 

00:00:16.410 --> 00:00:21.510
 specifies that the kills laboratories have 

00:00:18.840 --> 00:00:23.789
 developed together with dermatologist doctors 

00:00:21.510 --> 00:00:25.470
 by harvard a line that goes to answer 

00:00:23.789 --> 00:00:27.720
 to the different needs of ours 

00:00:25.470 --> 00:00:30.179
 need for specifics like wrinkles 

00:00:27.720 --> 00:00:32.340
 how sensitivity and how the spots the 

00:00:30.179 --> 00:00:34.290
 clearly line is a complete line that 

00:00:32.340 --> 00:00:36.899
 part from cleansing includes the 

00:00:34.290 --> 00:00:39.870
 the serum tonic the emulsion the moisturizer 

00:00:36.899 --> 00:00:41.370
 it is also a special extinct I say 

00:00:39.870 --> 00:00:44.070
 special because this year has also been 

00:00:41.370 --> 00:00:47.100
 awarded the beauty l award 

00:00:44.070 --> 00:00:49.260
 as the best illuminating exfoliant 

00:00:47.100 --> 00:00:51.510
 the whole line is characterized by two 

00:00:49.260 --> 00:00:54.270
 basic active ingredients that are milk every 

00:00:51.510 --> 00:00:56.280
 it is the white birch and our serum 

00:00:54.270 --> 00:00:58.770
 which is the cli ari dark water solutions 

00:00:56.280 --> 00:01:00.570
 within which there is also the 

00:00:58.770 --> 00:01:03.650
 active vitamin c 

00:01:00.570 --> 00:01:06.689
 this serum applied morning and evening 

00:01:03.650 --> 00:01:08.490
 guarantees as I told you immediately 

00:01:06.689 --> 00:01:10.320
 face brightness also goes to 

00:01:08.490 --> 00:01:12.060
 work very well on stains 

00:01:10.320 --> 00:01:14.100
 both skin and those already formed e 

00:01:12.060 --> 00:01:15.630
 especially on that information 

00:01:14.100 --> 00:01:17.670
 obviously before going to lay the 

00:01:15.630 --> 00:01:19.619
 our serum we will have cleansed in 

00:01:17.670 --> 00:01:21.960
 depth our skin and using 

00:01:19.619 --> 00:01:24.600
 the refine foam influencer tool that 

00:01:21.960 --> 00:01:28.229
 this contains peony and white birch 

00:01:24.600 --> 00:01:30.710
 it is an odorless and colorless gel that I will go to 

00:01:28.229 --> 00:01:33.119
 emulsify on wet face 

00:01:30.710 --> 00:01:34.939
 massaging it in this way and then 

00:01:33.119 --> 00:01:36.960
 rinsing abundantly 

00:01:34.939 --> 00:01:38.700
 later I will use the tonic 

00:01:36.960 --> 00:01:40.920
 you know how important the use is 

00:01:38.700 --> 00:01:43.320
 of the tonic to go precisely to 

00:01:40.920 --> 00:01:45.159
 finish a more thorough cleaning 

00:01:43.320 --> 00:01:46.869
 of our skin after our style 

00:01:45.159 --> 00:01:49.479
 I said we're going to apply the emulsion 

00:01:46.869 --> 00:01:51.819
 I chose the emulsion for you for the 

00:01:49.479 --> 00:01:53.950
 day especially for normal skin 

00:01:51.819 --> 00:01:57.009
 mixed because it has a texture easily 

00:01:53.950 --> 00:01:59.490
 absorbable so I will spend it on everything 

00:01:57.009 --> 00:02:01.569
 face and neck but after emulsion 

00:01:59.490 --> 00:02:04.030
 illuminating moisturizer we'll go 

00:02:01.569 --> 00:02:06.880
 definitely to put it as the last step 

00:02:04.030 --> 00:02:10.479
 in the morning before the make up ours 

00:02:06.880 --> 00:02:12.670
 ultralight fans with 50 protection 

00:02:10.479 --> 00:02:15.129
 evening then we will retrace all the 

00:02:12.670 --> 00:02:17.519
 step up to the serum of ours 

00:02:15.129 --> 00:02:20.769
 treatment and then we're going to apply 

00:02:17.519 --> 00:02:22.629
 the cream is a more substantial test 

00:02:20.769 --> 00:02:24.760
 for the evening to the evening we know that the 

00:02:22.629 --> 00:02:26.920
 leather reporte of the moment in which it receives 

00:02:24.760 --> 00:02:28.390
 better the active ingredients and it's time 

00:02:26.920 --> 00:02:30.340
 in which even more need for pampering 

00:02:28.390 --> 00:02:33.000
 of hydration then we will go to 

00:02:30.340 --> 00:02:36.069
 use a minimum amount of 

00:02:33.000 --> 00:02:38.140
 product that is absorbed by one's own 

00:02:36.069 --> 00:02:39.129
 this feeling of pampering of comfort 

00:02:38.140 --> 00:02:41.680
 on our skin 

00:02:39.129 --> 00:02:43.870
 once a week then the way 

00:02:41.680 --> 00:02:45.609
 better to use the extinguisher 

00:02:43.870 --> 00:02:48.220
 the one to go to in a truck and face 

00:02:45.609 --> 00:02:50.980
 use the usual water with lukewarm water 

00:02:48.220 --> 00:02:53.920
 our 50 cents coin from 

00:02:50.980 --> 00:02:56.410
 massage first on the palm of the hand and 

00:02:53.920 --> 00:02:59.019
 then spread on the face making some 

00:02:56.410 --> 00:03:00.970
 very delicate rotary massages 

00:02:59.019 --> 00:03:03.579
 I can leave it for a few seconds 

00:03:00.970 --> 00:03:05.349
 and then again everything with water then 

00:03:03.579 --> 00:03:07.660
 with the use of our line 

00:03:05.349 --> 00:03:09.849
 clearly corrected white you will have the skin 

00:03:07.660 --> 00:03:12.599
 perfectly de third hydrated e 

00:03:09.849 --> 00:03:12.599
 illuminated
