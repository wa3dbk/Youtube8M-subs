we now have yet another fracking

of<00:00:05.400> course<00:00:05.430> the<00:00:05.879> situation<00:00:06.569> in<00:00:06.690> West<00:00:06.930> Virginia

00:00:07.010 --> 00:00:07.020 
of course the situation in West Virginia

00:00:07.020 --> 00:00:09.830 
of course the situation in West Virginia
we<00:00:07.649> discussed<00:00:08.099> it<00:00:08.280> extensively<00:00:08.760> where<00:00:09.660> there

00:00:09.830 --> 00:00:09.840 
we discussed it extensively where there

00:00:09.840 --> 00:00:12.020 
we discussed it extensively where there
was<00:00:09.960> a<00:00:09.990> chemical<00:00:10.559> spill<00:00:10.710> that<00:00:11.190> contaminated

00:00:12.020 --> 00:00:12.030 
was a chemical spill that contaminated

00:00:12.030 --> 00:00:16.369 
was a chemical spill that contaminated
the<00:00:12.330> water<00:00:12.450> of<00:00:13.139> more<00:00:13.769> than<00:00:14.420> 300,000<00:00:15.420> homes<00:00:15.870> in

00:00:19.820 --> 00:00:19.830 
West Virginia and it uh eventually made

00:00:19.830 --> 00:00:22.310 
West Virginia and it uh eventually made
its<00:00:20.010> way<00:00:20.220> to<00:00:20.279> the<00:00:20.760> Ohio<00:00:21.119> River<00:00:21.270> or<00:00:21.779> to<00:00:21.990> Ohio

rather via the Ohio River and we had a

00:00:25.890 --> 00:00:28.460 
rather via the Ohio River and we had a

on fracking a couple of weeks ago we

00:00:51.629 --> 00:00:53.479 
on fracking a couple of weeks ago we
told<00:00:51.809> you<00:00:52.020> about<00:00:52.050> how<00:00:52.379> there's<00:00:52.559> a<00:00:52.620> new<00:00:52.829> plan<00:00:53.129> to

00:00:53.479 --> 00:00:53.489 
told you about how there's a new plan to

00:00:53.489 --> 00:00:55.760 
told you about how there's a new plan to
actually<00:00:53.910> frack<00:00:54.329> beneath<00:00:54.899> the<00:00:55.289> Ohio<00:00:55.649> River

00:02:04.530 --> 00:02:07.359 
hear about these wells is the source of
the<00:02:04.680> problem<00:02:05.159> we<00:02:05.640> now<00:02:05.880> have<00:02:06.240> tainted<00:02:06.869> water

in California
and<00:02:13.060> I<00:02:13.630> think<00:02:13.810> that<00:02:14.260> there's<00:02:14.440> probably<00:02:14.830> some

00:02:15.150 --> 00:02:15.160 
and I think that there's probably some

00:02:15.160 --> 00:02:17.970 
and I think that there's probably some
regulation<00:02:15.940> around<00:02:16.030> this<00:02:16.450> but<00:02:16.810> as<00:02:17.470> far<00:02:17.710> as<00:02:17.770> i

00:02:17.970 --> 00:02:17.980 
regulation around this but as far as i

00:02:17.980 --> 00:02:19.800 
regulation around this but as far as i
know<00:02:18.040> i<00:02:18.220> mean<00:02:18.700> it<00:02:18.910> that<00:02:18.940> there's<00:02:19.390> really<00:02:19.540> no

00:02:19.800 --> 00:02:19.810 
know i mean it that there's really no

00:02:19.810 --> 00:02:22.320 
know i mean it that there's really no

that's<00:03:57.610> most<00:03:57.850> people<00:03:58.239> Louis<00:03:58.510> most<00:03:59.200> people<00:03:59.470> do

00:03:59.580 --> 00:03:59.590 
that's most people Louis most people do

00:03:59.590 --> 00:04:02.070 
that's most people Louis most people do
eat<00:03:59.739> food<00:03:59.980> uh<00:04:00.370> honestly<00:04:01.060> it's<00:04:01.720> it's

00:04:02.070 --> 00:04:02.080 
eat food uh honestly it's it's

00:04:02.080 --> 00:04:04.080 
eat food uh honestly it's it's
unfortunate<00:04:02.950> but<00:04:03.040> we<00:04:03.160> have<00:04:03.310> to<00:04:03.489> hope<00:04:03.640> that<00:04:03.670> if

00:04:04.080 --> 00:04:04.090 
unfortunate but we have to hope that if

00:04:04.090 --> 00:04:05.970 
unfortunate but we have to hope that if
this<00:04:04.269> water<00:04:04.510> is<00:04:04.600> toxic<00:04:05.350> as<00:04:05.500> we<00:04:05.620> think<00:04:05.800> it<00:04:05.920> is

00:04:05.970 --> 00:04:05.980 
this water is toxic as we think it is

00:04:05.980 --> 00:04:07.949 
this water is toxic as we think it is
that<00:04:06.430> it<00:04:06.550> just<00:04:06.730> kills<00:04:06.940> that<00:04:07.120> produce<00:04:07.360> instead

00:04:07.949 --> 00:04:07.959 
that it just kills that produce instead

00:04:07.959 --> 00:04:10.680 
that it just kills that produce instead
of<00:04:08.080> uh<00:04:08.430> saturates<00:04:09.430> it<00:04:09.610> and<00:04:09.790> then<00:04:09.970> having<00:04:10.660> that

00:04:10.680 --> 00:04:10.690 
of uh saturates it and then having that

00:04:10.690 --> 00:04:12.449 
of uh saturates it and then having that
produce<00:04:10.959> being<00:04:11.260> sent<00:04:11.500> out<00:04:11.590> to<00:04:11.769> market<00:04:12.130> yeah<00:04:12.430> I

00:04:12.449 --> 00:04:12.459 
produce being sent out to market yeah I

00:04:12.459 --> 00:04:15.210 
produce being sent out to market yeah I
I<00:04:12.670> don't<00:04:13.180> know<00:04:13.390> exactly<00:04:14.080> what<00:04:14.530> the<00:04:14.680> effect<00:04:15.010> on

00:04:15.210 --> 00:04:15.220 
I don't know exactly what the effect on

00:04:15.220 --> 00:04:17.430 
I don't know exactly what the effect on
programming<00:04:16.180> produce<00:04:16.660> would<00:04:16.870> be<00:04:17.049> would<00:04:17.350> it

00:04:17.430 --> 00:04:17.440 
programming produce would be would it

00:04:17.440 --> 00:04:18.690 
programming produce would be would it
just<00:04:17.470> kill<00:04:17.799> the<00:04:17.919> produce<00:04:18.280> or<00:04:18.430> would<00:04:18.580> it<00:04:18.609> just

00:04:18.690 --> 00:04:18.700 
just kill the produce or would it just

00:04:18.700 --> 00:04:21.009 
just kill the produce or would it just
uh<00:04:19.350> contaminated<00:04:20.350> and<00:04:20.560> then

00:04:21.009 --> 00:04:21.019 
uh contaminated and then

00:04:21.019 --> 00:04:23.619 
uh contaminated and then
you<00:04:21.349> have<00:04:21.560> uh<00:04:21.789> collard<00:04:22.789> greens<00:04:23.090> or<00:04:23.389> whatever

00:04:23.619 --> 00:04:23.629 
you have uh collard greens or whatever

00:04:23.629 --> 00:04:25.300 
you have uh collard greens or whatever
