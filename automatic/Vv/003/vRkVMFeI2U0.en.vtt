00:00:13.450 --> 00:00:13.460 
actually factory 10 already there this

00:00:13.460 --> 00:00:16.960 
actually factory 10 already there this
makes<00:00:13.880> it<00:00:14.059> hard<00:00:14.389> to<00:00:15.019> see<00:00:15.320> through<00:00:15.620> the<00:00:16.609> glass

stretch<00:01:48.830> across<00:01:50.320> and<00:01:51.430> I<00:01:52.430> overlap<00:01:53.000> quite<00:01:53.360> a<00:01:53.390> bit

00:01:53.740 --> 00:01:53.750 
stretch across and I overlap quite a bit

00:01:53.750 --> 00:01:57.219 
stretch across and I overlap quite a bit
of<00:01:54.369> the<00:01:55.369> two<00:01:55.549> pieces<00:01:55.820> of<00:01:56.180> liner<00:01:56.420> so<00:01:56.899> that<00:01:56.930> it'll

00:01:57.219 --> 00:01:57.229 
of the two pieces of liner so that it'll

00:01:57.229 --> 00:02:00.700 
of the two pieces of liner so that it'll
stay<00:01:57.530> together<00:01:58.119> this<00:01:59.119> is<00:01:59.420> leftover<00:01:59.990> film<00:02:00.380> from

00:02:00.710 --> 00:02:03.010 
stay together this is leftover film from
the<00:02:00.830> back<00:02:01.009> window<00:02:01.399> I'm<00:02:01.610> using<00:02:02.060> my<00:02:02.299> glass<00:02:02.539> table

00:02:03.010 --> 00:02:03.020 
the back window I'm using my glass table

00:02:03.020 --> 00:02:06.460 
the back window I'm using my glass table
to<00:02:03.649> cut<00:02:03.860> off<00:02:04.009> the<00:02:04.340> bottom<00:02:04.490> edge<00:02:05.049> it<00:02:06.049> usually

00:02:06.460 --> 00:02:06.470 
to cut off the bottom edge it usually

00:02:06.470 --> 00:02:08.410 
to cut off the bottom edge it usually
has<00:02:06.619> roller<00:02:06.979> marks<00:02:07.310> from<00:02:07.610> a<00:02:07.729> plotter<00:02:08.060> that<00:02:08.239> I

00:02:08.410 --> 00:02:08.420 
has roller marks from a plotter that I

00:02:08.420 --> 00:02:11.770 
has roller marks from a plotter that I
use<00:02:08.920> so<00:02:09.920> that<00:02:09.950> sometimes<00:02:10.640> I<00:02:10.850> can<00:02:11.090> actually<00:02:11.300> use

00:02:11.770 --> 00:02:11.780 
use so that sometimes I can actually use

00:02:11.780 --> 00:02:13.540 
use so that sometimes I can actually use
the<00:02:12.020> bottom<00:02:12.319> edge<00:02:12.470> if<00:02:12.680> I<00:02:12.800> need<00:02:12.980> to<00:02:13.190> in<00:02:13.400> this

00:02:13.540 --> 00:02:13.550 
the bottom edge if I need to in this

00:02:13.550 --> 00:02:17.640 
the bottom edge if I need to in this
case<00:02:13.850> I'm<00:02:14.720> going<00:02:14.930> to<00:02:14.989> hand<00:02:15.380> cut<00:02:15.620> my<00:02:15.890> own<00:02:15.920> arch

00:02:17.640 --> 00:02:17.650 
case I'm going to hand cut my own arch

00:02:17.650 --> 00:02:20.710 
case I'm going to hand cut my own arch
so<00:02:18.650> after<00:02:19.069> I've<00:02:19.190> placed<00:02:19.489> my<00:02:19.670> template<00:02:20.269> on<00:02:20.420> top

00:02:20.710 --> 00:02:20.720 
so after I've placed my template on top

00:02:20.720 --> 00:02:23.800 
so after I've placed my template on top
of<00:02:21.200> the<00:02:21.319> film<00:02:21.590> I'll<00:02:22.160> use<00:02:22.430> my<00:02:22.700> ruler<00:02:22.970> to<00:02:23.390> cut<00:02:23.600> the

00:02:23.800 --> 00:02:23.810 
of the film I'll use my ruler to cut the

00:02:23.810 --> 00:02:28.509 
of the film I'll use my ruler to cut the
both<00:02:24.110> sides<00:02:24.850> and<00:02:26.950> then<00:02:27.950> I'm<00:02:28.160> just<00:02:28.310> going<00:02:28.459> to

00:02:28.509 --> 00:02:28.519 
both sides and then I'm just going to

00:02:28.519 --> 00:02:32.559 
both sides and then I'm just going to
overlap<00:02:29.230> the<00:02:30.230> film<00:02:30.590> and<00:02:30.980> match<00:02:31.880> up<00:02:32.209> the<00:02:32.390> two

00:02:32.559 --> 00:02:32.569 
overlap the film and match up the two

00:02:32.569 --> 00:02:41.880 
overlap the film and match up the two
corners<00:02:37.239> I'm<00:02:38.239> also<00:02:38.450> cutting<00:02:38.900> the<00:02:39.200> mirror<00:02:39.760> and

as<00:02:42.890> I<00:02:43.040> match<00:02:43.310> up<00:02:43.340> these<00:02:43.730> two<00:02:44.060> corners<00:02:44.810> as<00:02:45.320> I

00:02:46.060 --> 00:02:46.070 
as I match up these two corners as I

00:02:46.070 --> 00:02:49.780 
as I match up these two corners as I
mentioned<00:02:46.579> I'm<00:02:47.390> going<00:02:47.450> to<00:02:47.660> hand<00:02:48.049> cut<00:02:48.920> the

00:02:49.780 --> 00:02:49.790

00:02:49.790 --> 00:02:55.720 
mentioned I'm going to hand cut the
bottom<00:02:50.180> edge<00:02:50.480> I<00:02:53.980> can't<00:02:54.980> fold<00:02:55.280> the<00:02:55.489> film

00:02:55.720 --> 00:02:55.730 
bottom edge I can't fold the film

00:02:55.730 --> 00:02:57.789 
bottom edge I can't fold the film
completely<00:02:56.239> in<00:02:56.690> half<00:02:56.959> or<00:02:57.260> it'll<00:02:57.410> crease<00:02:57.650> in

00:02:57.789 --> 00:02:57.799 
completely in half or it'll crease in

00:02:57.799 --> 00:02:59.199 
completely in half or it'll crease in
the<00:02:57.920> middle<00:02:57.950> so<00:02:58.430> what<00:02:58.609> little<00:02:58.880> bit<00:02:59.030> in<00:02:59.120> the

00:02:59.199 --> 00:02:59.209 
the middle so what little bit in the

00:02:59.209 --> 00:03:01.750
