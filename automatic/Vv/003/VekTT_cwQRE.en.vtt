producer<00:04:30.590> to<00:04:30.680> kill<00:04:30.949> it<00:04:31.129> even<00:04:31.789> if<00:04:31.879> it<00:04:31.999> was<00:04:32.180> at

00:04:32.379 --> 00:04:32.389 
producer to kill it even if it was at

00:04:32.389 --> 00:04:34.300 
producer to kill it even if it was at
the<00:04:32.479> demo<00:04:32.659> no<00:04:32.990> cute<00:04:33.319> yeah<00:04:33.680> kill<00:04:33.979> it<00:04:34.099> but<00:04:34.219> I

00:04:34.300 --> 00:04:34.310 
the demo no cute yeah kill it but I

00:04:34.310 --> 00:04:35.739 
the demo no cute yeah kill it but I
don't<00:04:34.370> think<00:04:34.550> you<00:04:34.669> need<00:04:34.789> to<00:04:34.849> kill<00:04:35.120> it<00:04:35.270> for<00:04:35.449> 10

00:04:35.739 --> 00:04:35.749 
don't think you need to kill it for 10

00:04:35.749 --> 00:04:38.050 
don't think you need to kill it for 10
songs<00:04:36.139> I<00:04:36.379> think<00:04:36.529> it's<00:04:36.620> a<00:04:36.680> waste<00:04:36.830> of<00:04:37.069> money<00:04:37.490> with

00:04:38.050 --> 00:04:38.060 
songs I think it's a waste of money with

00:04:38.060 --> 00:04:41.080 
songs I think it's a waste of money with
a<00:04:38.090> rock<00:04:38.360> band<00:04:38.770> they<00:04:39.770> may<00:04:39.979> rerelease<00:04:40.490> the<00:04:40.729> album

00:04:41.080 --> 00:04:41.090 
a rock band they may rerelease the album

00:04:41.090 --> 00:04:42.580 
a rock band they may rerelease the album
as<00:04:41.270> is<00:04:41.539> though<00:04:41.960> they're<00:04:42.139> probably<00:04:42.289> going<00:04:42.499> to

00:04:42.580 --> 00:04:42.590 
as is though they're probably going to

00:04:42.590 --> 00:04:45.249 
as is though they're probably going to
remix<00:04:42.949> it<00:04:43.159> but<00:04:43.310> with<00:04:43.490> pop<00:04:43.789> I<00:04:44.150> think<00:04:44.960> it's<00:04:45.080> going

00:04:45.249 --> 00:04:45.259 
remix it but with pop I think it's going

00:04:45.259 --> 00:04:47.589 
remix it but with pop I think it's going
to<00:04:45.379> totally<00:04:45.529> be<00:04:45.860> redone<00:04:46.340> so<00:04:46.639> I<00:04:46.789> look<00:04:47.150> at<00:04:47.300> most

00:04:47.589 --> 00:04:47.599 
to totally be redone so I look at most

00:04:47.599 --> 00:04:49.600 
to totally be redone so I look at most
things<00:04:47.840> as<00:04:48.050> a<00:04:48.080> demo<00:04:48.439> so<00:04:49.129> what<00:04:49.430> that's

00:04:49.600 --> 00:04:49.610 
things as a demo so what that's

00:04:49.610 --> 00:04:52.629 
things as a demo so what that's
different<00:04:50.120> than<00:04:50.300> what<00:04:50.539> we<00:04:50.659> hear<00:04:51.490> sometimes<00:04:52.490> on

00:04:52.629 --> 00:04:52.639 
different than what we hear sometimes on

00:04:52.639 --> 00:04:55.300 
different than what we hear sometimes on
the<00:04:52.729> other<00:04:52.879> side<00:04:53.090> and<00:04:53.419> what<00:04:53.840> constantly<00:04:54.529> we

00:04:55.300 --> 00:04:55.310 
the other side and what constantly we

00:04:55.310 --> 00:04:57.249 
the other side and what constantly we
hear<00:04:55.580> as<00:04:55.699> artists<00:04:56.060> is<00:04:56.180> that<00:04:56.210> labels<00:04:57.050> won't

00:04:57.249 --> 00:04:57.259 
hear as artists is that labels won't

00:04:57.259 --> 00:04:58.600 
hear as artists is that labels won't
even<00:04:57.409> look<00:04:57.590> at<00:04:57.770> you<00:04:57.889> anymore<00:04:58.129> until<00:04:58.400> you've

00:04:58.600 --> 00:04:58.610 
even look at you anymore until you've

00:04:58.610 --> 00:05:00.070 
even look at you anymore until you've
paid<00:04:58.849> for<00:04:58.879> your<00:04:59.180> own<00:04:59.300> record<00:04:59.659> they<00:04:59.779> have<00:04:59.900> no

00:05:00.070 --> 00:05:00.080 
paid for your own record they have no

00:05:00.080 --> 00:05:03.670 
paid for your own record they have no
money<00:05:00.319> to<00:05:00.620> invest<00:05:00.860> so<00:05:01.840> maybe<00:05:02.840> on<00:05:03.080> a<00:05:03.110> mid-level

00:05:03.670 --> 00:05:03.680 
money to invest so maybe on a mid-level

00:05:03.680 --> 00:05:05.640 
money to invest so maybe on a mid-level
but<00:05:04.159> maybe<00:05:04.370> if<00:05:04.610> they<00:05:04.789> happen<00:05:05.180> to<00:05:05.210> notice

00:05:05.640 --> 00:05:05.650 
but maybe if they happen to notice

00:05:05.650 --> 00:05:08.409 
but maybe if they happen to notice
particularly<00:05:06.650> a<00:05:07.009> young<00:05:07.340> pop<00:05:07.580> artist<00:05:08.000> /<00:05:08.210> say

00:05:08.409 --> 00:05:08.419 
particularly a young pop artist / say

00:05:08.419 --> 00:05:09.969 
particularly a young pop artist / say
that<00:05:08.689> really<00:05:09.080> stood<00:05:09.319> out<00:05:09.439> then<00:05:09.680> they<00:05:09.830> would

00:05:09.969 --> 00:05:09.979 
that really stood out then they would

00:05:09.979 --> 00:05:11.860 
that really stood out then they would
invest<00:05:10.279> the<00:05:10.400> money<00:05:10.430> but<00:05:10.849> that's<00:05:11.150> all<00:05:11.330> we<00:05:11.629> hear

00:05:11.860 --> 00:05:11.870 
invest the money but that's all we hear

younger<00:05:37.250> artists<00:05:37.669> don't<00:05:38.120> seem<00:05:38.419> to<00:05:38.509> be<00:05:38.629> as

00:05:38.649 --> 00:05:38.659 
younger artists don't seem to be as

00:05:38.659 --> 00:05:41.829 
younger artists don't seem to be as

00:05:41.829 --> 00:05:41.839 
concerned about publishing some of the

00:05:41.839 --> 00:05:44.439 
concerned about publishing some of the
older<00:05:42.110> artists<00:05:42.560> are<00:05:42.680> well<00:05:43.460> they<00:05:44.089> might<00:05:44.270> not

00:05:48.100 --> 00:05:48.110 
right I mean that's just part of the

00:05:48.110 --> 00:05:50.200 
right I mean that's just part of the
deal<00:05:48.349> what's<00:05:49.099> part<00:05:49.339> of<00:05:49.460> it<00:05:49.550> and<00:05:49.699> they've<00:05:50.060> never

00:05:50.200 --> 00:05:50.210 
deal what's part of it and they've never

00:05:50.210 --> 00:05:52.089 
deal what's part of it and they've never
made<00:05:50.479> any<00:05:50.689> money<00:05:50.750> when<00:05:51.169> you<00:05:51.289> make<00:05:51.560> money<00:05:51.830> and
