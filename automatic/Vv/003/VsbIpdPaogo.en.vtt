hello<00:01:30.710> tiny<00:01:31.710> like<00:01:32.220> uh<00:01:33.200> no<00:01:34.200> never

00:01:42.750 --> 00:01:42.760 

00:01:42.760 --> 00:01:46.719 

here<00:01:43.760> it<00:01:43.850> is<00:01:43.940> the<00:01:44.210> EVGA<00:01:44.570> GTX<00:01:45.500> 295<00:01:45.950> co-op

00:01:46.719 --> 00:01:46.729 
here it is the EVGA GTX 295 co-op

00:01:46.729 --> 00:01:48.610 
here it is the EVGA GTX 295 co-op
edition<00:01:47.180> so<00:01:47.810> the<00:01:47.930> first<00:01:48.110> question<00:01:48.229> you

00:01:48.610 --> 00:01:48.620 
edition so the first question you

00:01:48.620 --> 00:01:51.100 
edition so the first question you
probably<00:01:49.070> have<00:01:49.310> is<00:01:49.580> how<00:01:50.090> is<00:01:50.270> this<00:01:50.390> card<00:01:50.690> differ

00:01:51.100 --> 00:01:51.110 
probably have is how is this card differ

00:01:51.110 --> 00:01:55.090 
probably have is how is this card differ
from<00:01:51.500> the<00:01:51.710> previous<00:01:52.220> EVGA<00:01:52.790> GTX<00:01:53.330> 295<00:01:53.720> and<00:01:54.229> the

00:01:55.090 --> 00:01:55.100 
from the previous EVGA GTX 295 and the

00:01:55.100 --> 00:01:57.370 
from the previous EVGA GTX 295 and the
answer<00:01:55.580> is<00:01:55.610> the<00:01:56.180> layout<00:01:56.600> of<00:01:56.630> the<00:01:56.810> components

00:01:57.370 --> 00:01:57.380 
answer is the layout of the components

00:01:57.380 --> 00:02:00.430 
answer is the layout of the components
on<00:01:57.470> the<00:01:57.560> card<00:01:57.830> it<00:01:58.220> is<00:01:58.910> a<00:01:59.210> little<00:01:59.780> bit<00:01:59.960> different

00:02:00.430 --> 00:02:00.440 
on the card it is a little bit different

00:02:00.440 --> 00:02:02.350 
on the card it is a little bit different
and<00:02:00.560> we'll<00:02:00.710> show<00:02:00.979> you<00:02:01.010> that<00:02:01.340> in<00:02:01.550> just<00:02:01.580> a<00:02:01.970> second

00:02:02.350 --> 00:02:02.360 
and we'll show you that in just a second

00:02:02.360 --> 00:02:03.760 
and we'll show you that in just a second
other<00:02:02.570> than<00:02:02.750> that<00:02:02.840> the<00:02:03.110> performance<00:02:03.440> is

00:02:03.760 --> 00:02:03.770 
other than that the performance is

00:02:03.770 --> 00:02:05.770 
other than that the performance is
identical<00:02:04.369> you<00:02:04.910> can<00:02:05.060> see<00:02:05.270> that<00:02:05.300> it<00:02:05.600> does<00:02:05.750> have

00:02:05.770 --> 00:02:05.780 
identical you can see that it does have

00:02:05.780 --> 00:02:07.690 
identical you can see that it does have
the<00:02:06.080> same<00:02:06.350> power<00:02:06.680> connector<00:02:07.130> than<00:02:07.280> a<00:02:07.369> pen<00:02:07.610> in

00:02:07.690 --> 00:02:07.700 
the same power connector than a pen in

00:02:07.700 --> 00:02:14.050 
the same power connector than a pen in
two<00:02:07.850> 6-pin<00:02:10.720> so<00:02:11.720> here<00:02:11.900> it<00:02:11.989> is<00:02:12.050> the<00:02:12.380> EVGA<00:02:12.770> GTX<00:02:13.580> 295

00:02:14.050 --> 00:02:14.060 
two 6-pin so here it is the EVGA GTX 295

00:02:14.060 --> 00:02:17.020 
two 6-pin so here it is the EVGA GTX 295
hydro<00:02:14.720> copper<00:02:15.020> water<00:02:15.440> block<00:02:15.739> you<00:02:16.640> can<00:02:16.790> see<00:02:16.970> if

00:02:17.020 --> 00:02:17.030 
hydro copper water block you can see if

00:02:17.030 --> 00:02:20.050 
hydro copper water block you can see if
we<00:02:17.180> open<00:02:17.360> it<00:02:17.630> up<00:02:17.800> it<00:02:18.800> has<00:02:19.250> a<00:02:19.280> high<00:02:19.700> flow

00:02:20.050 --> 00:02:20.060 
we open it up it has a high flow

00:02:20.060 --> 00:02:23.650 
we open it up it has a high flow
interior<00:02:20.660> and<00:02:20.930> it<00:02:21.800> has<00:02:22.040> the<00:02:22.459> patented<00:02:23.150> eflow

00:02:23.650 --> 00:02:23.660 
interior and it has the patented eflow

00:02:23.660 --> 00:02:26.020 
interior and it has the patented eflow
design<00:02:24.050> it<00:02:24.350> actually<00:02:24.470> has<00:02:24.830> 30<00:02:25.370> of<00:02:25.640> the<00:02:25.760> small

00:02:26.020 --> 00:02:26.030 
design it actually has 30 of the small

00:02:26.030 --> 00:02:29.500 
design it actually has 30 of the small
ease<00:02:26.330> which<00:02:26.720> helps<00:02:27.459> transfer<00:02:28.459> the<00:02:28.580> heat<00:02:28.610> from

00:02:29.500 --> 00:02:29.510 
ease which helps transfer the heat from

00:02:29.510 --> 00:02:32.140 
ease which helps transfer the heat from
the<00:02:29.600> GPUs<00:02:30.230> to<00:02:30.410> the<00:02:30.500> water<00:02:30.709> it<00:02:30.950> travels<00:02:31.370> over

00:02:32.140 --> 00:02:32.150 
the GPUs to the water it travels over

00:02:32.150 --> 00:02:34.440 
the GPUs to the water it travels over
both<00:02:32.420> of<00:02:32.450> the<00:02:32.690> GPS<00:02:33.200> and<00:02:33.380> the<00:02:33.620> memories<00:02:33.980> and

00:02:34.440 --> 00:02:34.450 
both of the GPS and the memories and

00:02:34.450 --> 00:02:38.080 
both of the GPS and the memories and
EVGA<00:02:35.450> does<00:02:35.750> include<00:02:36.230> both<00:02:36.800> the<00:02:36.830> half<00:02:37.550> innocent

00:02:38.080 --> 00:02:38.090 
EVGA does include both the half innocent

00:02:38.090 --> 00:02:40.390 
EVGA does include both the half innocent
three<00:02:38.270> eighths<00:02:38.570> inch<00:02:38.840> Barb's<00:02:39.260> which<00:02:39.830> are<00:02:40.100> also

00:02:40.390 --> 00:02:40.400 
three eighths inch Barb's which are also

00:02:40.400 --> 00:02:43.270 
three eighths inch Barb's which are also
high<00:02:40.940> flow<00:02:41.380> so<00:02:42.380> this<00:02:42.709> is<00:02:42.739> the<00:02:43.040> ultimate

00:02:43.270 --> 00:02:43.280 
high flow so this is the ultimate

00:02:43.280 --> 00:02:45.009 
high flow so this is the ultimate
solution<00:02:43.730> for<00:02:44.150> those<00:02:44.239> of<00:02:44.390> you<00:02:44.450> who<00:02:44.600> want<00:02:44.840> to

00:02:45.009 --> 00:02:45.019 
solution for those of you who want to
