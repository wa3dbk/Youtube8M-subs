I'm going to do a tutorial on a style
that<00:00:06.089> was<00:00:06.180> sent<00:00:06.420> to<00:00:06.480> me<00:00:06.660> from<00:00:06.690> my<00:00:06.990> subscriber

00:00:07.430 --> 00:00:07.440 
that was sent to me from my subscriber

00:00:07.440 --> 00:00:11.299 
that was sent to me from my subscriber
and<00:00:07.890> it<00:00:08.519> was<00:00:08.670> the<00:00:08.849> 3d<00:00:09.480> heart<00:00:09.840> so<00:00:10.740> basically

00:00:11.299 --> 00:00:11.309 
and it was the 3d heart so basically

00:00:11.309 --> 00:00:12.589 
and it was the 3d heart so basically
you're<00:00:11.490> gonna<00:00:11.550> start<00:00:11.880> off<00:00:11.969> with<00:00:12.000> the<00:00:12.330> heart

00:00:12.589 --> 00:00:12.599 
you're gonna start off with the heart

00:00:12.599 --> 00:00:17.540 
you're gonna start off with the heart
and<00:00:14.540> let<00:00:15.540> me<00:00:15.630> go<00:00:15.719> ahead<00:00:15.870> and<00:00:16.020> pop<00:00:16.740> this<00:00:17.010> in<00:00:17.250> I'm

00:00:17.540 --> 00:00:17.550 
and let me go ahead and pop this in I'm

00:00:17.550 --> 00:00:19.189 
and let me go ahead and pop this in I'm
not<00:00:17.760> the<00:00:17.970> originator<00:00:18.359> or<00:00:18.630> creator<00:00:19.020> of<00:00:19.080> this

00:00:19.189 --> 00:00:19.199 
not the originator or creator of this

00:00:19.199 --> 00:00:21.560 
not the originator or creator of this
now<00:00:19.410> we<00:00:20.130> just<00:00:20.279> simply<00:00:20.609> recreated<00:00:21.119> in<00:00:21.240> style

00:00:21.560 --> 00:00:21.570 
now we just simply recreated in style

00:00:21.570 --> 00:00:25.630 
now we just simply recreated in style
for<00:00:21.930> a<00:00:21.960> subscriber<00:00:22.880> so<00:00:23.880> I<00:00:24.150> started<00:00:24.660> off<00:00:24.810> with<00:00:25.050> a

00:00:25.630 --> 00:00:25.640 
for a subscriber so I started off with a

00:00:25.640 --> 00:00:28.400 
for a subscriber so I started off with a
heart-shaped<00:00:26.640> part<00:00:27.210> and<00:00:27.900> here<00:00:28.109> I'm<00:00:28.199> actually

00:00:28.400 --> 00:00:28.410 
heart-shaped part and here I'm actually

00:00:28.410 --> 00:00:32.240 
heart-shaped part and here I'm actually
just<00:00:28.859> adding<00:00:29.310> in<00:00:30.439> will<00:00:31.439> be<00:00:31.679> some<00:00:31.890> diagonal

00:00:32.240 --> 00:00:32.250 
just adding in will be some diagonal

00:00:32.250 --> 00:00:34.810 
just adding in will be some diagonal
braids<00:00:32.700> so<00:00:33.059> as<00:00:33.210> you<00:00:33.300> can<00:00:33.360> see<00:00:33.450> I'm<00:00:33.660> making

00:00:34.810 --> 00:00:34.820 
braids so as you can see I'm making

00:00:34.820 --> 00:00:38.750 
braids so as you can see I'm making
parks<00:00:35.820> one<00:00:36.120> and<00:00:36.420> go<00:00:36.870> toward<00:00:37.320> the<00:00:37.410> arch<00:00:37.920> if<00:00:38.489> that

00:00:38.750 --> 00:00:38.760 
parks one and go toward the arch if that

00:00:38.760 --> 00:00:42.940 
parks one and go toward the arch if that
makes<00:00:38.969> sense

00:00:42.940 --> 00:00:42.950 

00:00:42.950 --> 00:00:46.220 

it's<00:00:43.950> kind<00:00:44.160> of<00:00:44.219> like<00:00:44.370> a<00:00:44.660> I'll<00:00:45.660> say<00:00:45.930> I'm<00:00:45.989> also

00:00:46.220 --> 00:00:46.230 
it's kind of like a I'll say I'm also

00:00:46.230 --> 00:00:48.740 
it's kind of like a I'll say I'm also
like<00:00:46.500> a<00:00:46.530> triangle<00:00:47.190> and<00:00:47.579> that's<00:00:48.030> going<00:00:48.329> around

00:00:48.740 --> 00:00:48.750 
like a triangle and that's going around

00:00:48.750 --> 00:01:08.389 
like a triangle and that's going around
the<00:00:49.140> arch

00:01:08.389 --> 00:01:08.399 

00:01:08.399 --> 00:01:10.669 

just<00:01:09.030> not<00:01:09.210> flip<00:01:09.479> the<00:01:09.630> hair<00:01:09.840> out<00:01:09.990> the<00:01:10.170> way<00:01:10.320> and

00:01:10.669 --> 00:01:10.679 
just not flip the hair out the way and

00:01:10.679 --> 00:01:15.560 
just not flip the hair out the way and
begin<00:01:11.070> to<00:01:11.310> braid

00:01:15.560 --> 00:01:15.570 

00:01:15.570 --> 00:01:21.789 

split<00:01:16.170> that<00:01:16.320> into<00:01:17.240> kind<00:01:18.240> of<00:01:18.330> Brady

00:01:21.789 --> 00:01:21.799 

00:01:21.799 --> 00:01:55.110 

from<00:01:22.799> the<00:01:22.979> center<00:01:23.429> out

00:01:55.110 --> 00:01:55.120 

00:01:55.120 --> 00:01:57.370 

and<00:01:56.120> I'm<00:01:56.210> not<00:01:56.360> going<00:01:56.540> to<00:01:56.630> braid<00:01:56.870> the<00:01:57.170> braid

00:01:57.370 --> 00:01:57.380 
and I'm not going to braid the braid

00:01:57.380 --> 00:01:58.990 
and I'm not going to braid the braid
over<00:01:57.830> to<00:01:58.130> the<00:01:58.220> end<00:01:58.400> I'm<00:01:58.550> just<00:01:58.580> going<00:01:58.700> to<00:01:58.850> braid

00:01:58.990 --> 00:01:59.000 
over to the end I'm just going to braid

00:01:59.000 --> 00:02:02.050 
over to the end I'm just going to braid
it<00:01:59.030> halfway<00:01:59.710> and<00:02:00.710> then<00:02:00.770> repeat<00:02:01.670> the<00:02:01.790> same

00:02:02.050 --> 00:02:02.060 
it halfway and then repeat the same

00:02:02.060 --> 00:02:19.400 
it halfway and then repeat the same
thing<00:02:02.300> on<00:02:02.450> the<00:02:02.510> other<00:02:02.600> side

00:02:19.400 --> 00:02:19.410 

00:02:19.410 --> 00:02:21.810 

the<00:02:20.410> idea<00:02:20.800> is<00:02:20.890> I<00:02:20.920> mentioned<00:02:21.160> once<00:02:21.520> she<00:02:21.640> had<00:02:21.730> all

00:02:21.810 --> 00:02:21.820 
the idea is I mentioned once she had all

00:02:21.820 --> 00:02:23.490 
the idea is I mentioned once she had all
the<00:02:21.940> braids<00:02:22.180> completed<00:02:22.690> is<00:02:22.840> to<00:02:23.080> grab<00:02:23.320> the

00:02:23.490 --> 00:02:23.500 
the braids completed is to grab the

00:02:23.500 --> 00:02:26.730 
the braids completed is to grab the
braids<00:02:23.770> and<00:02:24.240> basically<00:02:25.240> make<00:02:25.570> a<00:02:25.600> kind<00:02:26.530> of<00:02:26.620> a

00:02:26.730 --> 00:02:26.740 
braids and basically make a kind of a

00:02:26.740 --> 00:02:29.520 
braids and basically make a kind of a
French<00:02:27.040> braid<00:02:27.280> going<00:02:27.790> down<00:02:28.170> with<00:02:29.170> all<00:02:29.350> the

00:02:29.520 --> 00:02:29.530 
French braid going down with all the

00:02:29.530 --> 00:02:32.700 
French braid going down with all the
braids<00:02:29.830> and<00:02:30.130> you'll<00:02:30.280> see<00:02:30.490> that<00:02:31.320> I'm<00:02:32.320> going<00:02:32.650> to

00:02:32.700 --> 00:02:32.710 
braids and you'll see that I'm going to

00:02:32.710 --> 00:02:34.110 
braids and you'll see that I'm going to
continue<00:02:32.980> the<00:02:33.190> same<00:02:33.370> pattern<00:02:33.940> which<00:02:34.090> is

00:02:34.110 --> 00:02:34.120 
continue the same pattern which is

00:02:34.120 --> 00:02:38.240 
continue the same pattern which is
making<00:02:34.450> the<00:02:34.720> triangle-shaped<00:02:36.780> part<00:02:37.780> or

00:02:38.240 --> 00:02:38.250 
making the triangle-shaped part or

00:02:38.250 --> 00:03:30.580 
making the triangle-shaped part or
v-shape<00:02:39.250> part

00:03:30.580 --> 00:03:30.590 

00:03:30.590 --> 00:03:42.370 

you

00:03:42.370 --> 00:03:42.380 

00:03:42.380 --> 00:04:34.030 

you

00:04:34.030 --> 00:04:34.040 

00:04:34.040 --> 00:04:36.200 

pleat<00:04:35.040> it<00:04:35.190> all<00:04:35.310> the<00:04:35.430> braids<00:04:35.700> and<00:04:36.000> then<00:04:36.150> I'm

00:04:36.200 --> 00:04:36.210 
pleat it all the braids and then I'm

00:04:36.210 --> 00:04:37.700 
pleat it all the braids and then I'm
just<00:04:36.300> going<00:04:36.480> to<00:04:36.570> gather<00:04:36.810> them<00:04:37.140> toward<00:04:37.560> the

00:04:37.700 --> 00:04:37.710 
just going to gather them toward the

00:04:37.710 --> 00:04:41.210 
just going to gather them toward the
center<00:04:38.070> and<00:04:38.280> just<00:04:39.180> do<00:04:39.840> a<00:04:39.870> simple<00:04:40.230> French<00:04:41.010> Way

00:04:41.210 --> 00:04:41.220

00:05:13.529 --> 00:05:13.539 
one from each side just starting to

00:05:13.539 --> 00:05:16.469 
one from each side just starting to
braid<00:05:14.500> them<00:05:14.740> that's<00:05:15.610> basically<00:05:16.030> all<00:05:16.270> I'm

00:05:16.469 --> 00:05:16.479 
braid them that's basically all I'm

braid them that's basically all I'm
doing<00:05:16.810> is<00:05:16.900> just<00:05:16.960> grabbing<00:05:17.560> a<00:05:17.770> braid

00:05:30.629 --> 00:05:30.639 

00:05:30.639 --> 00:05:32.999 

just<00:05:31.210> fatigue<00:05:31.539> to<00:05:31.840> do<00:05:31.960> the<00:05:32.050> same<00:05:32.259> thing<00:05:32.560> just<00:05:32.860> a

00:05:32.999 --> 00:05:33.009 
just fatigue to do the same thing just a
