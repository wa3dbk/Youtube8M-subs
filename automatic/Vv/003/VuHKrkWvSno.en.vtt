00:00:11.870 --> 00:00:16.460
 nice that you are here again 

00:00:13.849 --> 00:00:18.110
 holzwerken tv most of us 

00:00:16.460 --> 00:00:19.939
 We have a whole set of woodworks 

00:00:18.110 --> 00:00:22.070
 of such force themselves in the 

00:00:19.939 --> 00:00:23.210
 Workshop already laid something already 

00:00:22.070 --> 00:00:24.770
 a little bit in the years but come 

00:00:23.210 --> 00:00:26.960
 anyway here about the spindle yet 

00:00:24.770 --> 00:00:28.300
 everything is wonderfully functional 

00:00:26.960 --> 00:00:30.739
 so far in the green area 

00:00:28.300 --> 00:00:32.780
 maybe the only exception is this one 

00:00:30.739 --> 00:00:34.399
 The cap already has something in it 

00:00:32.780 --> 00:00:35.829
 years has come but that is too 

00:00:34.399 --> 00:00:38.090
 not tragic 

00:00:35.829 --> 00:00:40.610
 however, it is missing in most cases 

00:00:38.090 --> 00:00:42.829
 The protective cap therefore on the fixed arm 

00:00:40.610 --> 00:00:44.420
 is this caps you know it 

00:00:42.829 --> 00:00:45.969
 probably yourself slip a lot 

00:00:44.420 --> 00:00:48.289
 then quickly lay down on the floor 

00:00:45.969 --> 00:00:50.329
 will eventually be swept away in 

00:00:48.289 --> 00:00:52.460
 the corner land in an extra small 

00:00:50.329 --> 00:00:53.960
 shove and are no longer there 

00:00:52.460 --> 00:00:55.730
 Where they belong 

00:00:53.960 --> 00:00:57.710
 that is of course a problem if 

00:00:55.730 --> 00:00:58.760
 I've got the steel up right then 

00:00:57.710 --> 00:01:02.149
 my work piece and of course there are 

00:00:58.760 --> 00:01:05.390
 inevitably quirks and sharp imprints 

00:01:02.149 --> 00:01:07.310
 and the like because we woodworks yes us 

00:01:05.390 --> 00:01:10.340
 generally for quite good whom, too 

00:01:07.310 --> 00:01:12.920
 manually we grab in small blocks 

00:01:10.340 --> 00:01:14.960
 At the lender, they hold each one 

00:01:12.920 --> 00:01:16.310
 between and then apply the force 

00:01:14.960 --> 00:01:18.400
 but you can already see it here 

00:01:16.310 --> 00:01:20.960
 that already needs a certain amount 

00:01:18.400 --> 00:01:22.160
 handling that is neat at all 

00:01:20.960 --> 00:01:23.720
 hinzukriegen and that's a very 

00:01:22.160 --> 00:01:25.730
 shaky history and actually 

00:01:23.720 --> 00:01:27.350
 It does not make fun and it can 

00:01:25.730 --> 00:01:30.380
 really bad presentation 

00:01:27.350 --> 00:01:32.690
 lead if you have to tamper so 

00:01:30.380 --> 00:01:35.150
 So my tip is yours 

00:01:32.690 --> 00:01:38.150
 Add a little bit of attitude and that 

00:01:35.150 --> 00:01:40.850
 best about little magnets come to me 

00:01:38.150 --> 00:01:42.080
 even so little magnets they are everywhere 

00:01:40.850 --> 00:01:44.420
 find on the internet 

00:01:42.080 --> 00:01:46.340
 google for the word neodymium and 

00:01:44.420 --> 00:01:48.710
 then you will find numerous shops where you 

00:01:46.340 --> 00:01:51.380
 find such little magnets that exist 

00:01:48.710 --> 00:01:53.780
 here as bullets as died as a disk 

00:01:51.380 --> 00:01:55.780
 as a cuboid in all of them 

00:01:53.780 --> 00:01:58.280
 able to imagine 

00:01:55.780 --> 00:02:00.620
 strong are these little magnets 

00:01:58.280 --> 00:02:03.260
 in that then mixed in neodymium 

00:02:00.620 --> 00:02:05.720
 that it is an element in the field of 

00:02:03.260 --> 00:02:08.509
 rare earth and that really lends 

00:02:05.720 --> 00:02:11.269
 a special holding power we use 

00:02:08.509 --> 00:02:13.519
 now for our allowances a neodymium 

00:02:11.269 --> 00:02:16.220
 Magnet in slices shape and goes 

00:02:13.519 --> 00:02:19.010
 follow these steps I take to me 

00:02:16.220 --> 00:02:20.770
 a wooden allowance in size like 

00:02:19.010 --> 00:02:24.070
 she wants to have 

00:02:20.770 --> 00:02:27.160
 drill in this case a 16 hole a 16 

00:02:24.070 --> 00:02:29.560
 millimeters and that's how deep that time 

00:02:27.160 --> 00:02:30.910
 sewn easily in it so disappears 

00:02:29.560 --> 00:02:34.780
 that he does not care about the surface 

00:02:30.910 --> 00:02:36.760
 the wood looks out then I grab 

00:02:34.780 --> 00:02:39.220
 to have an adhesive in this case 

00:02:36.760 --> 00:02:40.120
 I screwed it from the box 

00:02:39.220 --> 00:02:41.800
 taken backup 

00:02:40.120 --> 00:02:43.930
 screw securing is actually for that 

00:02:41.800 --> 00:02:45.040
 because metal with metal firm and durable 

00:02:43.930 --> 00:02:47.710
 connect to 

00:02:45.040 --> 00:02:49.450
 But my experience shows that metal 

00:02:47.710 --> 00:02:51.430
 and wood as a connection there as well 

00:02:49.450 --> 00:02:55.800
 stable then works here then 

00:02:51.430 --> 00:02:58.630
 some droplets put in the magnet 

00:02:55.800 --> 00:03:00.610
 put her in as I said goes like that 

00:02:58.630 --> 00:03:03.370
 very slightly behind the wood surface 

00:03:00.610 --> 00:03:05.230
 back and then a little pressure on it 

00:03:03.370 --> 00:03:08.440
 Wait a quarter of an hour and get out 

00:03:05.230 --> 00:03:11.800
 If such an element is there then 

00:03:08.440 --> 00:03:13.390
 the magnet is firmly anchored in it and that 

00:03:11.800 --> 00:03:17.140
 is now the allowance you use 

00:03:13.390 --> 00:03:19.690
 can be attached to her twins at her arm 

00:03:17.140 --> 00:03:22.000
 and so nothing falls away they can 

00:03:19.690 --> 00:03:24.400
 can wonderfully use all the 

00:03:22.000 --> 00:03:25.600
 fix on the workpiece and you have one 

00:03:24.400 --> 00:03:28.090
 hand free for the really important ones 

00:03:25.600 --> 00:03:30.660
 things for the workpiece for the 

00:03:28.090 --> 00:03:33.040
 correct positioning of the items 

00:03:30.660 --> 00:03:34.390
 I hope this little trick with the 

00:03:33.040 --> 00:03:35.950
 magnets will carry you further in her 

00:03:34.390 --> 00:03:39.209
 Workshop I'll say until next time 

00:03:35.950 --> 00:03:39.209
