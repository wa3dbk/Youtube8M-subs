00:00:11.960 --> 00:00:11.970 
hey is Eric with cartoon learn

00:00:11.970 --> 00:00:15.440 
hey is Eric with cartoon learn
to<00:00:12.300> show<00:00:12.480> you<00:00:12.540> the<00:00:12.720> new<00:00:12.840> anime<00:00:13.410> studio<00:00:13.710> 7<00:00:14.550> pro

00:00:15.440 --> 00:00:15.450 
to show you the new anime studio 7 pro

00:00:15.450 --> 00:00:18.500 
to show you the new anime studio 7 pro
version<00:00:16.310> it<00:00:17.310> came<00:00:17.700> out<00:00:17.730> I<00:00:17.970> think<00:00:18.300> a<00:00:18.360> couple

00:00:18.500 --> 00:00:18.510 
version it came out I think a couple

00:00:18.510 --> 00:00:20.900 
version it came out I think a couple
date<00:00:18.780> go<00:00:18.990> and<00:00:19.200> I<00:00:19.260> bought<00:00:19.800> it<00:00:20.010> right<00:00:20.190> away<00:00:20.369> and<00:00:20.520> I

00:00:20.900 --> 00:00:20.910 
date go and I bought it right away and I

00:00:20.910 --> 00:00:22.370 
date go and I bought it right away and I
gotta<00:00:21.090> say<00:00:21.150> it's<00:00:21.390> been<00:00:21.540> pretty<00:00:21.779> easy<00:00:22.020> to<00:00:22.230> use

00:00:22.370 --> 00:00:22.380 
gotta say it's been pretty easy to use

00:00:22.380 --> 00:00:23.840 
gotta say it's been pretty easy to use
so<00:00:22.619> far<00:00:22.920> everything's<00:00:23.520> been<00:00:23.580> really

00:00:23.840 --> 00:00:23.850 
so far everything's been really

00:00:23.850 --> 00:00:25.460 
so far everything's been really
intuitive<00:00:24.180> i'm<00:00:25.170> going<00:00:25.260> to<00:00:25.350> show<00:00:25.439> you

00:00:25.460 --> 00:00:25.470 
intuitive i'm going to show you

00:00:25.470 --> 00:00:27.290 
intuitive i'm going to show you
specifically<00:00:26.130> the<00:00:26.369> physics<00:00:26.790> engine<00:00:26.910> today

00:00:27.290 --> 00:00:27.300 
specifically the physics engine today

00:00:27.300 --> 00:00:30.769 
specifically the physics engine today
and<00:00:28.259> what<00:00:28.410> I<00:00:28.439> did<00:00:28.650> was<00:00:28.860> I<00:00:29.040> created<00:00:29.070> a<00:00:29.700> you<00:00:30.630> can

00:00:30.769 --> 00:00:30.779 
and what I did was I created a you can

00:00:30.779 --> 00:00:33.830 
and what I did was I created a you can
see<00:00:30.930> the<00:00:31.079> triangle<00:00:31.850> and<00:00:32.850> the<00:00:33.030> ground<00:00:33.329> is<00:00:33.660> all

00:00:33.830 --> 00:00:33.840 
see the triangle and the ground is all

00:00:33.840 --> 00:00:35.690 
see the triangle and the ground is all
fixed<00:00:34.230> and<00:00:34.590> then<00:00:34.950> I've<00:00:35.130> got<00:00:35.280> this<00:00:35.460> little

00:00:35.690 --> 00:00:35.700 
fixed and then I've got this little

00:00:35.700 --> 00:00:37.250 
fixed and then I've got this little
thing<00:00:36.090> that's<00:00:36.270> going<00:00:36.480> to<00:00:36.510> swing<00:00:36.840> from<00:00:37.079> its

00:00:37.250 --> 00:00:37.260 
thing that's going to swing from its

00:00:37.260 --> 00:00:39.080 
thing that's going to swing from its
origin<00:00:37.680> point<00:00:37.920> which<00:00:38.190> is<00:00:38.220> right<00:00:38.520> here<00:00:38.550> and

00:00:39.080 --> 00:00:39.090 
origin point which is right here and

00:00:39.090 --> 00:00:43.010 
origin point which is right here and
then<00:00:39.780> I<00:00:39.810> created<00:00:40.260> the<00:00:40.410> ball<00:00:41.420> to<00:00:42.420> demonstrate

00:00:43.010 --> 00:00:43.020 
then I created the ball to demonstrate

00:00:43.020 --> 00:00:45.590 
then I created the ball to demonstrate
the<00:00:43.140> physics<00:00:43.530> and<00:00:43.770> then<00:00:44.060> this<00:00:45.060> little<00:00:45.360> thing

00:00:45.590 --> 00:00:45.600 
the physics and then this little thing

00:00:45.600 --> 00:00:48.050 
the physics and then this little thing
is<00:00:45.630> just<00:00:46.020> an<00:00:46.530> object<00:00:47.070> with<00:00:47.280> a<00:00:47.310> hole<00:00:47.550> in<00:00:47.580> it<00:00:47.910> and

00:00:48.050 --> 00:00:48.060 
is just an object with a hole in it and

00:00:48.060 --> 00:00:52.220 
is just an object with a hole in it and
I<00:00:48.900> turned<00:00:49.140> it<00:00:49.260> into<00:00:49.410> a<00:00:49.500> gear<00:00:50.540> so<00:00:51.540> basically<00:00:52.080> to

00:00:52.220 --> 00:00:52.230 
I turned it into a gear so basically to

00:00:52.230 --> 00:00:54.320 
I turned it into a gear so basically to
use<00:00:52.380> physics<00:00:52.920> it's<00:00:53.220> real<00:00:53.640> easy<00:00:53.880> you<00:00:54.300> just

00:00:54.320 --> 00:00:54.330 
use physics it's real easy you just

00:00:54.330 --> 00:00:56.390 
use physics it's real easy you just
create<00:00:54.810> a<00:00:54.870> bunch<00:00:54.990> of<00:00:55.080> vector<00:00:55.410> layers<00:00:55.650> create<00:00:56.220> a

00:00:56.390 --> 00:00:56.400 
create a bunch of vector layers create a

00:00:56.400 --> 00:00:59.200 
create a bunch of vector layers create a
group<00:00:56.900> stick<00:00:57.900> your<00:00:57.930> vectors<00:00:58.410> in<00:00:58.560> the<00:00:58.680> group

00:00:59.200 --> 00:00:59.210 
group stick your vectors in the group

00:00:59.210 --> 00:01:02.180 
group stick your vectors in the group
double-click<00:01:00.210> the<00:01:00.360> group<00:01:00.860> come<00:01:01.860> up<00:01:01.980> to<00:01:02.100> the

00:01:02.180 --> 00:01:02.190 
double-click the group come up to the

00:01:02.190 --> 00:01:05.240 
double-click the group come up to the
physics<00:01:02.640> tab<00:01:02.880> and<00:01:03.439> enable<00:01:04.439> physics<00:01:04.830> and<00:01:05.100> you

00:01:05.240 --> 00:01:05.250 
physics tab and enable physics and you

00:01:05.250 --> 00:01:06.859 
physics tab and enable physics and you
can<00:01:05.400> change<00:01:05.640> the<00:01:05.790> gravity<00:01:06.270> direction<00:01:06.750> to

00:01:06.859 --> 00:01:06.869 
can change the gravity direction to

00:01:06.869 --> 00:01:10.600 
can change the gravity direction to
whatever<00:01:07.140> you<00:01:07.290> want<00:01:07.850> and<00:01:08.850> then<00:01:08.909> the<00:01:09.600> magnitude

00:01:10.600 --> 00:01:10.610 
whatever you want and then the magnitude

00:01:10.610 --> 00:01:13.310 
whatever you want and then the magnitude
so<00:01:11.610> once<00:01:11.880> it's<00:01:12.090> enabled<00:01:12.570> then<00:01:12.720> have<00:01:12.930> control

00:01:13.310 --> 00:01:13.320 
so once it's enabled then have control

00:01:13.320 --> 00:01:16.330 
so once it's enabled then have control
over<00:01:13.350> each<00:01:13.740> individual<00:01:14.430> layer<00:01:14.670> like<00:01:14.939> my<00:01:15.180> ball

00:01:16.330 --> 00:01:16.340 
over each individual layer like my ball

00:01:16.340 --> 00:01:19.130 
over each individual layer like my ball
go<00:01:17.340> to<00:01:17.430> the<00:01:17.520> physics<00:01:18.000> I've<00:01:18.450> got<00:01:18.720> physics

00:01:19.130 --> 00:01:19.140 
go to the physics I've got physics

00:01:19.140 --> 00:01:22.820 
go to the physics I've got physics
enabled<00:01:20.120> it's<00:01:21.120> a<00:01:21.240> moving<00:01:21.540> object<00:01:21.900> it<00:01:22.500> doesn't

00:01:22.820 --> 00:01:22.830 
enabled it's a moving object it doesn't

00:01:22.830 --> 00:01:25.610 
enabled it's a moving object it doesn't
start<00:01:23.100> asleep<00:01:23.580> it<00:01:24.000> doesn't<00:01:24.360> pivot<00:01:24.840> it<00:01:25.080> doesn't

00:01:25.610 --> 00:01:25.620 
start asleep it doesn't pivot it doesn't

00:01:25.620 --> 00:01:27.890 
start asleep it doesn't pivot it doesn't
it's<00:01:26.460> not<00:01:26.670> a<00:01:26.700> motor<00:01:27.090> and<00:01:27.420> it<00:01:27.479> doesn't<00:01:27.750> have<00:01:27.810> a

00:01:27.890 --> 00:01:27.900 
it's not a motor and it doesn't have a

00:01:27.900 --> 00:01:31.160 
it's not a motor and it doesn't have a
force<00:01:28.200> field<00:01:28.470> so<00:01:29.270> whereas<00:01:30.270> my<00:01:30.510> gear<00:01:30.960> on<00:01:30.990> the

00:01:31.160 --> 00:01:31.170 
force field so whereas my gear on the

00:01:31.170 --> 00:01:36.469 
force field so whereas my gear on the
other<00:01:31.320> hand<00:01:32.000> I've<00:01:33.000> enabled<00:01:33.390> physics<00:01:34.580> and<00:01:35.580> it

00:01:36.469 --> 00:01:36.479 
other hand I've enabled physics and it

00:01:36.479 --> 00:01:38.810 
other hand I've enabled physics and it
checks<00:01:36.990> the<00:01:37.110> box<00:01:37.350> for<00:01:37.590> pivot<00:01:37.950> on<00:01:38.040> origin<00:01:38.610> and

00:01:38.810 --> 00:01:38.820 
checks the box for pivot on origin and

00:01:38.820 --> 00:01:42.380 
checks the box for pivot on origin and
then<00:01:39.060> you<00:01:39.270> if<00:01:40.170> if<00:01:40.500> this<00:01:40.740> was<00:01:40.950> checked<00:01:41.270> it<00:01:42.270> would

00:01:42.380 --> 00:01:42.390 
then you if if this was checked it would

00:01:42.390 --> 00:01:45.110 
then you if if this was checked it would
actually<00:01:42.510> swing<00:01:42.960> from<00:01:43.229> its<00:01:43.409> pivot<00:01:44.000> because<00:01:45.000> I

00:01:45.110 --> 00:01:45.120 
actually swing from its pivot because I

00:01:45.120 --> 00:01:47.690 
actually swing from its pivot because I
checked<00:01:45.390> in<00:01:45.690> April<00:01:46.260> motor<00:01:46.560> it's<00:01:47.310> going<00:01:47.490> to<00:01:47.549> act

00:01:47.690 --> 00:01:47.700 
checked in April motor it's going to act

00:01:47.700 --> 00:01:49.010 
checked in April motor it's going to act
like<00:01:47.820> a<00:01:47.940> motor<00:01:48.330> and<00:01:48.510> i'll<00:01:48.630> show<00:01:48.659> you<00:01:48.840> how<00:01:48.900> easy

00:01:49.010 --> 00:01:49.020 
like a motor and i'll show you how easy

00:01:49.020 --> 00:01:52.520 
like a motor and i'll show you how easy
it<00:01:49.440> is<00:01:49.530> all<00:01:50.100> you<00:01:50.280> do<00:01:50.430> is<00:01:50.549> you<00:01:50.670> take<00:01:51.060> your<00:01:51.530> like

00:01:52.520 --> 00:01:52.530 
it is all you do is you take your like

00:01:52.530 --> 00:01:55.280 
it is all you do is you take your like
the<00:01:52.650> ball<00:01:52.830> object<00:01:53.400> stick<00:01:54.210> it<00:01:54.360> inside<00:01:54.630> of<00:01:55.170> the

00:01:55.280 --> 00:01:55.290 
the ball object stick it inside of the

00:01:55.290 --> 00:02:00.050 
the ball object stick it inside of the
thing<00:01:55.530> and<00:01:55.760> then<00:01:57.140> click<00:01:58.140> play<00:01:58.409> and<00:01:58.909> you<00:01:59.909> can

00:02:00.050 --> 00:02:00.060 
thing and then click play and you can

00:02:00.060 --> 00:02:04.789 
thing and then click play and you can
see<00:02:00.270> it<00:02:00.360> spinning<00:02:00.659> and<00:02:02.000> that's<00:02:03.000> as<00:02:03.659> easy<00:02:04.080> as<00:02:04.710> it

00:02:04.789 --> 00:02:04.799 
see it spinning and that's as easy as it

00:02:04.799 --> 00:02:07.039 
see it spinning and that's as easy as it
is<00:02:04.860> my<00:02:05.520> origin<00:02:05.760> points<00:02:06.330> in<00:02:06.450> the<00:02:06.540> center<00:02:06.840> if<00:02:06.960> I

00:02:07.039 --> 00:02:07.049 
is my origin points in the center if I

00:02:07.049 --> 00:02:08.449 
is my origin points in the center if I
were<00:02:07.170> to<00:02:07.260> move<00:02:07.409> it<00:02:07.560> over<00:02:07.619> here<00:02:07.799> the<00:02:08.250> thing

00:02:08.449 --> 00:02:08.459 
were to move it over here the thing

00:02:08.459 --> 00:02:09.919 
were to move it over here the thing
would<00:02:08.610> just<00:02:08.640> move<00:02:08.970> in<00:02:09.149> a<00:02:09.209> great<00:02:09.420> big<00:02:09.629> circle

00:02:09.919 --> 00:02:09.929

00:02:14.270 --> 00:02:14.280 
like this and I can I won't demonstrate

00:02:14.280 --> 00:02:20.160 
like this and I can I won't demonstrate
that<00:02:14.819> all<00:02:15.629> right<00:02:15.810> now<00:02:16.019> if<00:02:16.200> I<00:02:16.290> take<00:02:16.319> the<00:02:16.620> ball

00:02:20.160 --> 00:02:20.170 

00:02:20.170 --> 00:02:23.140 

oops<00:02:21.170> let<00:02:21.740> me<00:02:21.800> go<00:02:21.920> back<00:02:22.070> to<00:02:22.130> frame<00:02:22.610> one<00:02:22.820> take

00:02:23.140 --> 00:02:23.150 
oops let me go back to frame one take

00:02:23.150 --> 00:02:26.080 
oops let me go back to frame one take
the<00:02:23.240> ball<00:02:23.420> and<00:02:23.450> I<00:02:23.660> move<00:02:23.840> it<00:02:23.960> outside<00:02:24.110> of<00:02:25.090> the

00:02:26.080 --> 00:02:26.090 
the ball and I move it outside of the

00:02:26.090 --> 00:02:30.100 
the ball and I move it outside of the
thing<00:02:26.330> and<00:02:26.540> hit<00:02:27.230> play<00:02:28.330> you<00:02:29.330> can<00:02:29.480> see<00:02:29.660> it<00:02:29.780> false

00:02:30.100 --> 00:02:30.110 
thing and hit play you can see it false

00:02:30.110 --> 00:02:32.710 
thing and hit play you can see it false
and<00:02:30.500> then<00:02:30.740> follows<00:02:31.190> natural<00:02:31.910> physics<00:02:32.360> for

replay this scene and show you what

00:03:14.630 --> 00:03:19.140 
replay this scene and show you what
happens<00:03:15.050> it'll<00:03:16.040> act<00:03:16.310> as<00:03:16.460> a<00:03:16.880> pendulum<00:03:17.470> and

00:03:19.140 --> 00:03:19.150 
happens it'll act as a pendulum and

00:03:19.150 --> 00:03:23.860 
happens it'll act as a pendulum and
catch<00:03:20.150> the<00:03:20.390> ball<00:03:21.820> but<00:03:22.820> anyway<00:03:23.360> that's<00:03:23.540> the<00:03:23.750> new

00:03:23.860 --> 00:03:23.870 
catch the ball but anyway that's the new

00:03:23.870 --> 00:03:26.890 
catch the ball but anyway that's the new
physics<00:03:24.290> engine<00:03:24.650> and<00:03:24.860> it<00:03:25.070> is<00:03:25.220> really<00:03:26.030> really

00:03:26.890 --> 00:03:26.900 
physics engine and it is really really

00:03:26.900 --> 00:03:32.949 
physics engine and it is really really
easy<00:03:27.140> to<00:03:27.650> use<00:03:28.510> very<00:03:29.510> intuitive<00:03:30.140> I<00:03:30.470> love<00:03:31.100> it<00:03:31.959> one

00:03:32.949 --> 00:03:32.959 
easy to use very intuitive I love it one

00:03:32.959 --> 00:03:34.390 
easy to use very intuitive I love it one
more<00:03:33.140> thing<00:03:33.380> if<00:03:33.650> you<00:03:33.980> want<00:03:34.160> to<00:03:34.250> create

00:03:34.390 --> 00:03:34.400 
more thing if you want to create

00:03:34.400 --> 00:03:35.620 
more thing if you want to create
something<00:03:34.490> a<00:03:34.820> little<00:03:34.910> bit<00:03:35.060> more<00:03:35.209> complex

00:03:35.620 --> 00:03:35.630 
something a little bit more complex

00:03:35.630 --> 00:03:38.320 
something a little bit more complex
let's<00:03:36.590> take<00:03:36.740> the<00:03:36.920> ball<00:03:37.220> and<00:03:37.580> I'll<00:03:38.150> actually

00:03:38.320 --> 00:03:38.330 
let's take the ball and I'll actually

00:03:38.330 --> 00:03:43.510 
let's take the ball and I'll actually
move<00:03:38.690> the<00:03:38.720> layer<00:03:39.020> over<00:03:40.630> oops<00:03:41.950> frame<00:03:42.950> 0<00:03:43.190> move

00:03:43.510 --> 00:03:43.520 
move the layer over oops frame 0 move

00:03:43.520 --> 00:03:45.630 
move the layer over oops frame 0 move
the<00:03:43.700> layer<00:03:43.850> over<00:03:44.240> and<00:03:44.480> just<00:03:44.660> touch<00:03:44.990> the<00:03:45.320> gear

00:03:45.630 --> 00:03:45.640 
the layer over and just touch the gear

00:03:45.640 --> 00:03:48.880 
the layer over and just touch the gear
and<00:03:46.640> then<00:03:47.090> activate<00:03:47.660> it<00:03:47.810> it<00:03:48.440> will<00:03:48.680> actually

00:03:48.880 --> 00:03:48.890 
and then activate it it will actually

00:03:48.890 --> 00:03:52.030 
and then activate it it will actually
then<00:03:49.250> follow<00:03:49.790> the<00:03:50.300> gear<00:03:51.230> around<00:03:51.500> as<00:03:51.740> if<00:03:51.890> it's

00:03:52.030 --> 00:03:52.040 
then follow the gear around as if it's

00:03:52.040 --> 00:03:53.410 
then follow the gear around as if it's
part<00:03:52.310> of<00:03:52.340> the<00:03:52.459> gear<00:03:52.640> so<00:03:52.880> you<00:03:52.940> could<00:03:53.120> do<00:03:53.240> some

00:03:53.410 --> 00:03:53.420 
part of the gear so you could do some

00:03:53.420 --> 00:03:58.000 
part of the gear so you could do some
more<00:03:54.790> complicated<00:03:55.790> things<00:03:56.620> that's<00:03:57.620> all<00:03:57.770> I<00:03:57.800> got

00:03:58.000 --> 00:03:58.010 
more complicated things that's all I got

00:03:58.010 --> 00:03:59.830 
more complicated things that's all I got
I<00:03:58.280> just<00:03:58.610> wanted<00:03:58.820> to<00:03:58.850> show<00:03:59.030> you<00:03:59.060> how<00:03:59.330> easy<00:03:59.360> it<00:03:59.780> is

00:03:59.830 --> 00:03:59.840 
I just wanted to show you how easy it is

00:03:59.840 --> 00:04:01.720 
I just wanted to show you how easy it is
to<00:03:59.990> use<00:04:00.050> in<00:04:00.560> case<00:04:00.860> anybody's<00:04:01.250> thinking<00:04:01.370> about
