00:01:07.190 --> 00:01:07.200 

00:01:07.200 --> 00:01:09.719 

that<00:01:08.200> is<00:01:08.380> exactly<00:01:09.010> what's<00:01:09.190> going<00:01:09.400> on<00:01:09.610> with

00:01:09.719 --> 00:01:09.729 
that is exactly what's going on with

00:01:09.729 --> 00:01:11.910 
that is exactly what's going on with
Jonah<00:01:09.909> right<00:01:10.240> now<00:01:10.390> he's<00:01:11.229> at<00:01:11.350> that<00:01:11.470> awkward<00:01:11.710> age

00:01:11.910 --> 00:01:11.920 
Jonah right now he's at that awkward age

00:01:11.920 --> 00:01:14.190 
Jonah right now he's at that awkward age
where<00:01:12.400> a<00:01:12.610> proper<00:01:13.119> nap<00:01:13.270> is<00:01:13.450> too<00:01:13.630> much<00:01:13.869> for<00:01:14.080> him

00:01:14.190 --> 00:01:14.200 
where a proper nap is too much for him

00:01:14.200 --> 00:01:15.540 
where a proper nap is too much for him
and<00:01:14.410> then<00:01:14.619> he<00:01:14.740> won't<00:01:14.890> go<00:01:15.040> to<00:01:15.070> sleep<00:01:15.369> at<00:01:15.520> night

00:01:15.540 --> 00:01:15.550 
and then he won't go to sleep at night

00:01:15.550 --> 00:01:18.330 
and then he won't go to sleep at night
but<00:01:16.270> if<00:01:16.420> he<00:01:16.509> has<00:01:16.690> no<00:01:16.990> nap<00:01:17.259> then<00:01:17.650> it<00:01:17.890> often<00:01:18.040> gets

00:01:18.330 --> 00:01:18.340 
but if he has no nap then it often gets

00:01:18.340 --> 00:01:20.010 
but if he has no nap then it often gets
too<00:01:18.520> late<00:01:18.700> in<00:01:18.850> the<00:01:18.940> afternoon<00:01:18.970> and<00:01:19.690> he<00:01:19.869> will

00:01:20.010 --> 00:01:20.020 
too late in the afternoon and he will

00:01:20.020 --> 00:01:22.350 
too late in the afternoon and he will
just<00:01:20.229> suddenly<00:01:20.380> conk<00:01:20.950> out<00:01:21.180> especially<00:01:22.180> if<00:01:22.240> we

00:01:22.350 --> 00:01:22.360 
just suddenly conk out especially if we

00:01:22.360 --> 00:01:24.870 
just suddenly conk out especially if we
go<00:01:22.479> out<00:01:22.600> in<00:01:22.750> the<00:01:22.840> car<00:01:23.080> or<00:01:23.470> the<00:01:23.500> pram<00:01:23.860> and<00:01:24.250> then

00:01:24.870 --> 00:01:24.880 
go out in the car or the pram and then

00:01:24.880 --> 00:01:31.260 
go out in the car or the pram and then
there<00:01:25.300> is<00:01:25.509> no<00:01:25.720> waking<00:01:25.960> him

00:01:31.260 --> 00:01:31.270 

00:01:31.270 --> 00:01:33.880 

so<00:01:32.270> this<00:01:32.510> is<00:01:32.690> definitely<00:01:33.230> still<00:01:33.440> a<00:01:33.470> work<00:01:33.710> in
