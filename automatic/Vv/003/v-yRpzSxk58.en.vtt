00:03:40.349 --> 00:03:40.359 
kind of loosely it wrap it around itself

00:03:40.359 --> 00:03:43.760 
kind of loosely it wrap it around itself
and<00:03:40.750> secure<00:03:41.290> it<00:03:41.410> with<00:03:41.470> an<00:03:41.799> elastic

00:03:57.000 --> 00:03:57.010 
and it kind of creates like a weird

00:03:57.010 --> 00:03:58.950 
and it kind of creates like a weird
twist<00:03:57.550> see<00:03:57.820> shape<00:03:58.000> it<00:03:58.150> kind<00:03:58.360> of<00:03:58.420> reminds<00:03:58.750> me<00:03:58.840> of

00:03:58.950 --> 00:03:58.960 
twist see shape it kind of reminds me of

00:03:58.960 --> 00:04:00.240 
twist see shape it kind of reminds me of
like<00:03:59.020> a<00:03:59.170> mushroom<00:03:59.500> or<00:03:59.710> something<00:03:59.740> I<00:04:00.190> don't

00:04:00.240 --> 00:04:00.250 
like a mushroom or something I don't

00:04:00.250 --> 00:04:02.520 
like a mushroom or something I don't
really<00:04:00.520> know<00:04:00.670> why<00:04:00.970> but<00:04:01.750> just<00:04:01.780> loosen<00:04:02.260> it<00:04:02.350> and

00:04:02.520 --> 00:04:02.530 
really know why but just loosen it and

00:04:02.530 --> 00:04:06.150 
really know why but just loosen it and
then<00:04:02.820> secure<00:04:03.820> it<00:04:03.850> with<00:04:04.150> your<00:04:05.020> bobby<00:04:05.560> pins<00:04:05.830> and

00:04:06.160 --> 00:04:09.960 
then secure it with your bobby pins and
that<00:04:06.670> is<00:04:06.970> your<00:04:07.600> third<00:04:08.170> bun<00:04:08.650> so<00:04:09.250> it's<00:04:09.430> kind<00:04:09.790> of

00:04:09.960 --> 00:04:09.970 
that is your third bun so it's kind of

00:04:09.970 --> 00:04:12.810 
that is your third bun so it's kind of
like<00:04:10.210> a<00:04:10.390> weird<00:04:10.660> twisty<00:04:11.350> mushroom<00:04:12.070> bun<00:04:12.430> but<00:04:12.790> I

00:04:12.810 --> 00:04:12.820 
like a weird twisty mushroom bun but I

00:04:12.820 --> 00:04:14.940 
like a weird twisty mushroom bun but I
actually<00:04:13.060> really<00:04:13.660> like<00:04:13.780> this<00:04:13.930> one<00:04:14.050> a<00:04:14.080> lot<00:04:14.380> then

00:04:14.940 --> 00:04:14.950 
actually really like this one a lot then

00:04:14.950 --> 00:04:16.260 
actually really like this one a lot then
just<00:04:15.340> make<00:04:15.460> sure<00:04:15.610> you<00:04:15.730> go<00:04:15.850> ahead<00:04:15.940> and

00:04:16.260 --> 00:04:16.270 
just make sure you go ahead and

00:04:16.270 --> 00:04:17.640 
just make sure you go ahead and
hairspray<00:04:16.510> it<00:04:16.750> and<00:04:16.900> fix<00:04:17.170> your<00:04:17.290> side<00:04:17.470> pieces

00:04:17.640 --> 00:04:17.650 
hairspray it and fix your side pieces

00:04:17.650 --> 00:04:20.970 
hairspray it and fix your side pieces
and<00:04:18.100> make<00:04:19.060> it<00:04:19.209> look<00:04:19.360> how<00:04:19.810> you<00:04:20.230> want<00:04:20.260> it<00:04:20.620> so

00:04:20.970 --> 00:04:20.980 
and make it look how you want it so

00:04:20.980 --> 00:04:24.520 
and make it look how you want it so
there<00:04:21.370> you<00:04:21.459> have<00:04:21.520> a<00:04:21.640> bun<00:04:22.000> number<00:04:22.300> three

00:04:24.520 --> 00:04:24.530 

00:04:24.530 --> 00:04:27.140 

so<00:04:25.530> for<00:04:25.770> bun<00:04:26.039> number<00:04:26.310> four<00:04:26.550> this<00:04:26.789> one<00:04:27.000> is

00:04:27.140 --> 00:04:27.150 
so for bun number four this one is

00:04:27.150 --> 00:04:28.640 
so for bun number four this one is
probably<00:04:27.360> the<00:04:27.539> most<00:04:27.599> different<00:04:28.289> it<00:04:28.590> looks

00:04:28.640 --> 00:04:28.650 
probably the most different it looks

00:04:28.650 --> 00:04:30.559 
probably the most different it looks
like<00:04:28.830> the<00:04:29.039> technique<00:04:29.460> of<00:04:29.639> how<00:04:29.729> you<00:04:29.969> do<00:04:30.240> it<00:04:30.389> so

00:04:30.559 --> 00:04:30.569 
like the technique of how you do it so

00:04:30.569 --> 00:04:32.300 
like the technique of how you do it so
start<00:04:30.810> off<00:04:30.960> just<00:04:31.020> by<00:04:31.229> teasing<00:04:31.560> your<00:04:31.830> roots<00:04:32.069> and

00:04:32.300 --> 00:04:32.310 
start off just by teasing your roots and

00:04:32.310 --> 00:04:34.490 
start off just by teasing your roots and
then<00:04:32.430> gathering<00:04:32.879> your<00:04:33.060> hair<00:04:33.240> up<00:04:33.389> into<00:04:33.659> a<00:04:33.930> high

00:04:34.490 --> 00:04:34.500 
then gathering your hair up into a high

00:04:34.500 --> 00:04:36.529 
then gathering your hair up into a high
ponytail<00:04:35.069> and<00:04:35.520> you<00:04:35.969> actually<00:04:36.300> want<00:04:36.449> the

00:04:36.529 --> 00:04:36.539 
ponytail and you actually want the

00:04:36.539 --> 00:04:38.149 
ponytail and you actually want the
ponytail<00:04:36.930> to<00:04:37.080> be<00:04:37.169> pretty<00:04:37.409> loose<00:04:37.620> you're<00:04:38.009> only

00:04:38.149 --> 00:04:38.159 
ponytail to be pretty loose you're only

00:04:38.159 --> 00:04:40.520 
ponytail to be pretty loose you're only
going<00:04:38.789> to<00:04:39.060> wrap<00:04:39.449> the<00:04:39.599> elastic<00:04:39.689> around<00:04:40.080> like

00:04:40.520 --> 00:04:40.530 
going to wrap the elastic around like

00:04:40.530 --> 00:04:42.260 
going to wrap the elastic around like
once<00:04:40.800> or<00:04:40.949> twice<00:04:41.189> depending<00:04:41.460> on<00:04:41.849> how<00:04:42.000> thick
