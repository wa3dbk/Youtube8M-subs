00:00:18.560 --> 00:00:18.570 
didn't really know that when I was

00:00:18.570 --> 00:00:20.210 
didn't really know that when I was
playing<00:00:18.779> in<00:00:19.050> justice<00:00:19.650> because<00:00:19.920> there<00:00:20.070> was

00:00:20.210 --> 00:00:20.220 
playing in justice because there was

00:00:20.220 --> 00:00:22.910 
playing in justice because there was
insurgency<00:00:20.760> in<00:00:21.449> a<00:00:21.720> Batman<00:00:22.230> and<00:00:22.769> there's

00:00:22.910 --> 00:00:22.920 
insurgency in a Batman and there's

00:00:22.920 --> 00:00:26.300 
insurgency in a Batman and there's
Batman<00:00:23.490> so<00:00:24.300> I<00:00:24.630> always<00:00:25.410> called<00:00:25.920> him<00:00:26.010> the

00:00:26.300 --> 00:00:26.310 
Batman so I always called him the

00:00:26.310 --> 00:00:29.740 
Batman so I always called him the
skinnier<00:00:26.939> Batman<00:00:27.570> so<00:00:27.930> this<00:00:28.230> is<00:00:28.470> the<00:00:28.740> injustice

00:00:29.740 --> 00:00:29.750 
skinnier Batman so this is the injustice

00:00:29.750 --> 00:00:33.560 
skinnier Batman so this is the injustice
costume<00:00:30.890> so<00:00:31.890> I<00:00:31.949> guess<00:00:32.219> the<00:00:32.640> person<00:00:32.880> scrolling

00:00:33.560 --> 00:00:33.570 
costume so I guess the person scrolling

00:00:33.570 --> 00:00:35.479 
costume so I guess the person scrolling
through<00:00:33.780> looking<00:00:34.320> at<00:00:34.380> the<00:00:34.440> skills<00:00:34.950> and<00:00:35.250> this

00:00:35.479 --> 00:00:35.489 
through looking at the skills and this

00:00:35.489 --> 00:00:42.139 
through looking at the skills and this
is<00:00:35.700> the<00:00:36.260> assault<00:00:37.260> stance<00:00:38.190> and<00:00:40.370> actually<00:00:41.370> that

00:00:42.139 --> 00:00:42.149 
is the assault stance and actually that

00:00:42.149 --> 00:00:45.200 
is the assault stance and actually that
when<00:00:42.360> I<00:00:42.600> was<00:00:42.719> sent<00:00:43.110> the<00:00:43.350> videos<00:00:43.710> this<00:00:44.579> portion

00:00:45.200 --> 00:00:45.210 
when I was sent the videos this portion

00:00:45.210 --> 00:00:48.020 
when I was sent the videos this portion
was<00:00:45.360> actually<00:00:45.809> Rini<00:00:46.170> name<00:00:46.739> part<00:00:47.190> want<00:00:47.670> and

00:00:48.020 --> 00:00:48.030 
was actually Rini name part want and

00:00:48.030 --> 00:00:52.189 
was actually Rini name part want and
then<00:00:48.180> they<00:00:48.360> went<00:00:48.510> from<00:00:48.950> injustice<00:00:49.950> to<00:00:51.199> Batman

00:00:52.189 --> 00:00:52.199 
then they went from injustice to Batman

00:00:52.199 --> 00:00:54.529 
then they went from injustice to Batman
Beyond<00:00:52.559> and<00:00:52.949> then<00:00:53.039> Batman<00:00:53.520> Beyond<00:00:53.879> like<00:00:54.420> they

00:00:54.529 --> 00:00:54.539 
Beyond and then Batman Beyond like they

00:00:54.539 --> 00:00:56.689 
Beyond and then Batman Beyond like they
they<00:00:54.750> went<00:00:54.899> from<00:00:55.170> top<00:00:55.530> to<00:00:55.559> bottom<00:00:55.800> instead<00:00:56.579> of

00:00:56.689 --> 00:00:56.699 
they went from top to bottom instead of

00:00:56.699 --> 00:00:59.299 
they went from top to bottom instead of
bottom<00:00:57.120> to<00:00:57.180> the<00:00:57.270> top<00:00:57.300> so<00:00:57.930> I<00:00:58.440> guess<00:00:58.829> they

00:00:59.299 --> 00:00:59.309 
bottom to the top so I guess they

00:00:59.309 --> 00:01:04.609 
bottom to the top so I guess they
stopped<00:00:59.579> doing<00:01:00.030> this<00:01:00.210> one<00:01:00.870> day<00:01:01.140> Ashley<00:01:03.589> when<00:01:04.589> I

00:01:04.609 --> 00:01:04.619 
stopped doing this one day Ashley when I

00:01:04.619 --> 00:01:07.130 
stopped doing this one day Ashley when I
was<00:01:04.799> going<00:01:04.979> through<00:01:05.129> the<00:01:05.850> beginning<00:01:06.479> costumes

00:01:07.130 --> 00:01:07.140 
was going through the beginning costumes

00:01:07.140 --> 00:01:10.789 
was going through the beginning costumes
or<00:01:07.409> the<00:01:07.619> suits<00:01:07.970> so<00:01:08.970> this<00:01:09.510> is<00:01:09.810> the<00:01:10.080> Dark<00:01:10.470> Knight

00:01:10.789 --> 00:01:10.799 
or the suits so this is the Dark Knight

00:01:10.799 --> 00:01:14.690 
or the suits so this is the Dark Knight
attack<00:01:11.490> or<00:01:11.880> a<00:01:12.360> guards<00:01:12.960> guarded<00:01:13.740> stance<00:01:13.920> attack

00:01:14.690 --> 00:01:14.700
