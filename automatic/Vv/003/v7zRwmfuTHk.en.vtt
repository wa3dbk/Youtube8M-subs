come and do you need depending on what I
play<00:00:48.780> instance<00:00:49.230> and<00:00:49.469> I<00:00:49.530> guess<00:00:49.739> it<00:00:49.890> did<00:00:50.010> so<00:00:50.280> yeah

00:00:50.420 --> 00:00:50.430 
play instance and I guess it did so yeah

00:00:50.430 --> 00:00:53.119 
play instance and I guess it did so yeah
it<00:00:50.640> certainly<00:00:50.879> helped<00:00:51.980> especially<00:00:52.980> its

00:00:53.119 --> 00:00:53.129 
it certainly helped especially its

00:00:53.129 --> 00:00:54.560 
it certainly helped especially its
racial<00:00:53.250> because<00:00:53.699> I<00:00:53.760> could<00:00:53.910> they<00:00:54.000> don't<00:00:54.149> have<00:00:54.239> a

00:00:54.560 --> 00:00:54.570 
racial because I could they don't have a

00:00:54.570 --> 00:00:56.750 
racial because I could they don't have a
tamer<00:00:54.899> in<00:00:55.020> a<00:00:55.230> ritual<00:00:56.100> based<00:00:56.309> on<00:00:56.430> board<00:00:56.579> they

00:00:56.750 --> 00:00:56.760 
tamer in a ritual based on board they

00:00:56.760 --> 00:00:59.209 
tamer in a ritual based on board they
obviously<00:00:56.940> can't<00:00:57.149> make<00:00:57.420> a<00:00:57.449> fugitive<00:00:57.960> and<00:00:58.800> then

00:00:59.209 --> 00:00:59.219 
obviously can't make a fugitive and then

00:00:59.219 --> 00:01:01.610

00:02:25.490 --> 00:02:25.500 
sent to the Graveyard I get to look at

00:02:25.500 --> 00:02:26.930 
sent to the Graveyard I get to look at
the<00:02:25.590> top<00:02:25.739> three<00:02:25.770> cards<00:02:26.100> of<00:02:26.190> my<00:02:26.250> deck<00:02:26.340> and<00:02:26.790> then

00:02:26.930 --> 00:02:26.940 
the top three cards of my deck and then

00:02:26.940 --> 00:02:28.340 
the top three cards of my deck and then
rearrange<00:02:27.330> it<00:02:27.450> anywhere<00:02:27.840> I<00:02:27.930> want<00:02:28.140> which<00:02:28.290> is

00:02:30.199 --> 00:02:30.209 
kind of busted and then the secondary

00:02:30.209 --> 00:02:33.670 
kind of busted and then the secondary
effect<00:02:30.510> on<00:02:31.500> your<00:02:32.010> opponent's<00:02:32.340> turn<00:02:32.459> I<00:02:32.730> can

00:02:33.670 --> 00:02:33.680 
effect on your opponent's turn I can

00:02:33.680 --> 00:02:36.140 
effect on your opponent's turn I can
banish<00:02:34.680> this<00:02:34.920> card<00:02:34.980> then<00:02:35.580> reveal<00:02:35.910> the<00:02:36.030> top

00:02:36.140 --> 00:02:36.150 
banish this card then reveal the top

00:02:36.150 --> 00:02:37.280 
banish this card then reveal the top
part<00:02:36.360> of<00:02:36.390> my<00:02:36.480> deck<00:02:36.660> and<00:02:36.780> if<00:02:36.930> it's<00:02:37.080> a<00:02:37.140> normal

00:02:37.280 --> 00:02:37.290 
part of my deck and if it's a normal

00:02:37.290 --> 00:02:39.080 
part of my deck and if it's a normal
trap<00:02:37.530> card<00:02:37.739> I<00:02:37.890> can<00:02:37.920> then<00:02:38.190> set<00:02:38.489> it<00:02:38.520> to<00:02:38.730> my<00:02:38.880> side

00:02:39.080 --> 00:02:39.090 
trap card I can then set it to my side

00:02:39.090 --> 00:02:40.910 
trap card I can then set it to my side
of<00:02:39.120> the<00:02:39.209> field<00:02:39.360> and<00:02:39.959> even<00:02:40.320> usually<00:02:40.470> that<00:02:40.739> turn

00:02:40.910 --> 00:02:40.920 
of the field and even usually that turn

00:02:40.920 --> 00:02:43.010 
of the field and even usually that turn
so<00:02:41.220> any<00:02:41.760> card<00:02:41.970> that<00:02:42.030> can<00:02:42.239> mess<00:02:42.660> with<00:02:42.810> a<00:02:42.870> game

00:02:43.010 --> 00:02:43.020 
so any card that can mess with a game

00:02:43.020 --> 00:02:44.660 
so any card that can mess with a game
mechanic<00:02:43.200> and<00:02:43.650> allow<00:02:43.860> you<00:02:43.920> said<00:02:44.400> it<00:02:44.489> use<00:02:44.640> a

00:02:44.660 --> 00:02:44.670 
mechanic and allow you said it use a

00:02:44.670 --> 00:02:45.710 
mechanic and allow you said it use a
card<00:02:44.910> you<00:02:44.940> just<00:02:45.060> say<00:02:45.300> that's<00:02:45.420> pretty<00:02:45.570> good

00:02:45.710 --> 00:02:45.720 
card you just say that's pretty good

00:02:45.720 --> 00:02:48.410 
card you just say that's pretty good
enough<00:02:45.930> in<00:02:46.280> this<00:02:47.280> car<00:02:47.489> does<00:02:47.610> this<00:02:47.730> make<00:02:48.360> you

00:02:48.410 --> 00:02:48.420 
enough in this car does this make you

00:02:48.420 --> 00:02:50.120 
enough in this car does this make you
feel<00:02:48.600> like<00:02:48.870> back<00:02:49.320> jack<00:02:49.560> that's<00:02:49.770> what<00:02:49.950> one<00:02:50.100> of

00:02:50.120 --> 00:02:50.130 
feel like back jack that's what one of

00:02:50.130 --> 00:02:51.770 
feel like back jack that's what one of
those<00:02:50.340> games<00:02:50.580> oh<00:02:50.850> yeah<00:02:51.150> it<00:02:51.239> certainly<00:02:51.390> helped

like<00:02:51.930> like<00:02:52.530> I<00:02:52.620> was<00:02:52.709> saying<00:02:52.890> with<00:02:53.010> the

00:02:53.060 --> 00:02:53.070 
like like I was saying with the

00:02:53.070 --> 00:02:55.130 
like like I was saying with the
mathematician<00:02:53.760> like<00:02:54.120> if<00:02:54.480> i<00:02:54.570> draw<00:02:54.720> handle<00:02:55.080> all

00:02:55.130 --> 00:02:55.140 
mathematician like if i draw handle all

00:02:55.140 --> 00:02:56.479 
mathematician like if i draw handle all
monsters<00:02:55.590> obviously<00:02:55.980> i'm<00:02:56.100> not<00:02:56.130> how<00:02:56.280> to<00:02:56.340> do

00:02:56.479 --> 00:02:56.489 
monsters obviously i'm not how to do

00:02:56.489 --> 00:02:58.490 
monsters obviously i'm not how to do
well<00:02:56.670> and<00:02:56.880> so<00:02:57.239> like<00:02:57.420> if<00:02:57.630> i<00:02:57.750> have<00:02:57.840> math<00:02:57.989> man<00:02:58.200> like

00:02:58.490 --> 00:02:58.500 
well and so like if i have math man like

00:02:58.500 --> 00:02:59.870 
well and so like if i have math man like
i'll<00:02:58.620> make<00:02:58.739> a<00:02:58.800> couple<00:02:58.980> Dante's<00:02:59.340> with<00:02:59.489> launches

00:02:59.870 --> 00:02:59.880 
i'll make a couple Dante's with launches

and<00:03:00.670> then<00:03:01.180> all<00:03:01.329> use<00:03:01.629> math<00:03:01.810> man<00:03:02.049> to<00:03:02.230> send<00:03:02.470> a

00:03:02.640 --> 00:03:02.650 
and then all use math man to send a

00:03:02.650 --> 00:03:04.530 
and then all use math man to send a
black<00:03:03.040> jacket<00:03:03.280> and<00:03:03.579> then<00:03:03.819> hopefully<00:03:04.090> stack<00:03:04.510> a

00:03:04.530 --> 00:03:04.540 
black jacket and then hopefully stack a

00:03:04.540 --> 00:03:07.410 
black jacket and then hopefully stack a
trap<00:03:04.900> and<00:03:05.170> then<00:03:05.590> set<00:03:06.010> a<00:03:06.040> trap<00:03:06.280> it<00:03:07.180> just<00:03:07.360> helps

00:03:07.410 --> 00:03:07.420 
trap and then set a trap it just helps

00:03:07.420 --> 00:03:09.839 
trap and then set a trap it just helps

second the Wonder I guess right which

00:03:50.230 --> 00:03:51.509 
second the Wonder I guess right which
helped<00:03:50.500> out<00:03:50.590> along<00:03:50.829> because<00:03:51.129> having<00:03:51.430> all

helped out along because having all
these<00:03:51.609> discard<00:03:51.939> trap<00:03:52.090> certainly<00:03:52.420> helps<00:03:52.659> where

00:03:53.429 --> 00:03:53.439 
these discard trap certainly helps where

00:03:53.439 --> 00:03:55.619 
these discard trap certainly helps where
you<00:03:53.530> perfectly<00:03:54.040> bombing<00:03:54.370> the<00:03:54.459> ratio<00:03:54.760> or<00:03:55.030> yeah

00:03:55.619 --> 00:03:55.629 
you perfectly bombing the ratio or yeah

00:03:55.629 --> 00:03:59.429 
you perfectly bombing the ratio or yeah
