00:01:26.690 --> 00:01:26.700 
power button by itself you see it says

see that slider come up but you're going

00:01:38.970 --> 00:01:42.649 
see that slider come up but you're going
to<00:01:39.030> ignore<00:01:39.150> it<00:01:39.619> nope<00:01:40.650> shut<00:01:41.400> off<00:01:41.490> first<00:01:41.700> see

00:01:42.649 --> 00:01:42.659 
to ignore it nope shut off first see

00:01:42.659 --> 00:01:44.749 
to ignore it nope shut off first see
there<00:01:42.840> we<00:01:42.960> go<00:01:43.079> it<00:01:43.680> forced<00:01:44.340> to<00:01:44.460> shutdown

00:01:44.749 --> 00:01:44.759 
there we go it forced to shutdown

00:01:44.759 --> 00:01:46.249 
there we go it forced to shutdown
without<00:01:45.270> doing<00:01:45.509> their<00:01:45.600> own<00:01:45.689> the<00:01:45.869> power<00:01:46.049> down

00:01:46.249 --> 00:01:46.259 
without doing their own the power down

00:01:46.259 --> 00:01:54.499 
without doing their own the power down
cycle<00:01:48.409> and<00:01:51.110> now<00:01:52.110> let's<00:01:52.470> say<00:01:52.860> so<00:01:53.610> that's<00:01:53.790> step

00:01:54.499 --> 00:01:54.509 
cycle and now let's say so that's step

00:01:54.509 --> 00:01:58.370 
cycle and now let's say so that's step
one<00:01:55.369> for<00:01:56.369> recovering<00:01:56.880> your<00:01:57.030> device<00:01:57.420> if<00:01:57.750> it's

00:01:58.370 --> 00:01:58.380 
one for recovering your device if it's

00:01:58.380 --> 00:02:01.819 
one for recovering your device if it's
stuck<00:01:58.710> in<00:01:58.860> a<00:01:58.920> loop<00:01:59.070> or<00:01:59.399> just<00:01:59.670> frozen<00:02:00.509> so<00:02:01.439> you

00:02:01.819 --> 00:02:01.829 
stuck in a loop or just frozen so you

00:02:01.829 --> 00:02:04.160 
stuck in a loop or just frozen so you
get<00:02:02.189> back<00:02:02.430> in<00:02:02.640> your<00:02:02.670> device<00:02:03.210> by<00:02:03.689> hard

00:02:04.160 --> 00:02:04.170 
get back in your device by hard

00:02:04.170 --> 00:02:06.830 
get back in your device by hard

00:04:57.270 --> 00:04:57.280 
restore mode which then requires your

00:04:57.280 --> 00:04:59.180 
restore mode which then requires your
device<00:04:57.610> being<00:04:58.000> plugged<00:04:58.419> into<00:04:58.720> a<00:04:58.990> computer

running<00:05:00.190> iTunes<00:05:00.490> and<00:05:01.210> you<00:05:01.389> will<00:05:01.509> need<00:05:01.659> to<00:05:01.840> run

00:05:02.070 --> 00:05:02.080 
running iTunes and you will need to run

00:05:02.080 --> 00:05:05.360 
running iTunes and you will need to run
a<00:05:02.289> restore<00:05:02.830> if<00:05:03.759> your<00:05:04.060> device<00:05:04.270> is<00:05:04.720> jailbroken

00:05:05.360 --> 00:05:05.370 
a restore if your device is jailbroken

00:05:05.370 --> 00:05:08.339 
a restore if your device is jailbroken
and<00:05:06.370> you're<00:05:06.729> doing<00:05:06.909> this<00:05:07.270> it's<00:05:07.960> going<00:05:08.229> to

00:05:08.339 --> 00:05:08.349 
and you're doing this it's going to

00:05:08.349 --> 00:05:10.290 
and you're doing this it's going to
completely<00:05:08.650> wipe<00:05:09.130> out<00:05:09.340> the<00:05:09.520> jailbreak<00:05:09.970> so

00:05:10.290 --> 00:05:10.300 
completely wipe out the jailbreak so

00:05:10.300 --> 00:05:13.170 
completely wipe out the jailbreak so
you're<00:05:10.479> gonna<00:05:10.630> lose<00:05:10.840> your<00:05:10.990> jailbreak<00:05:11.370> and<00:05:12.370> you

you're gonna lose your jailbreak and you

00:05:13.180 --> 00:05:14.730 
you're gonna lose your jailbreak and you
would<00:05:13.330> need<00:05:13.479> to<00:05:13.659> redo<00:05:14.080> your<00:05:14.110> jailbreak

00:05:14.730 --> 00:05:14.740 
would need to redo your jailbreak

00:05:14.740 --> 00:05:16.890 
would need to redo your jailbreak
assuming<00:05:15.520> that<00:05:15.759> a<00:05:15.789> jailbreak<00:05:16.270> is<00:05:16.389> available

00:05:16.890 --> 00:05:16.900 
assuming that a jailbreak is available

00:05:16.900 --> 00:05:19.279 
assuming that a jailbreak is available
for<00:05:17.080> whatever<00:05:17.259> the<00:05:17.530> current<00:05:17.949> version<00:05:18.370> of<00:05:18.430> iOS

00:05:19.289 --> 00:05:22.129 
for whatever the current version of iOS
ends<00:05:20.289> up<00:05:20.409> having<00:05:20.650> to<00:05:20.889> restore<00:05:21.310> to<00:05:21.430> your<00:05:21.550> device

00:05:22.129 --> 00:05:22.139 
ends up having to restore to your device

00:05:22.139 --> 00:05:26.939 
ends up having to restore to your device
to<00:05:23.139> enter<00:05:23.500> DFU<00:05:24.190> mode<00:05:24.900> you<00:05:25.900> would<00:05:26.020> first<00:05:26.379> power

00:05:26.939 --> 00:05:26.949 
to enter DFU mode you would first power

00:05:26.949 --> 00:05:29.730 
to enter DFU mode you would first power
off<00:05:27.280> your<00:05:27.310> device<00:05:27.610> completely<00:05:28.620> so<00:05:29.620> you'd

00:05:29.730 --> 00:05:29.740 
off your device completely so you'd

00:05:29.740 --> 00:05:32.010 
off your device completely so you'd
first<00:05:29.949> power<00:05:30.219> down<00:05:30.430> and<00:05:30.699> then<00:05:31.599> you<00:05:31.750> would<00:05:31.870> do

00:05:32.010 --> 00:05:32.020 
first power down and then you would do

00:05:32.020 --> 00:05:34.620 
first power down and then you would do
the<00:05:32.169> following<00:05:32.530> steps<00:05:32.680> I'm<00:05:33.520> going<00:05:34.180> to<00:05:34.270> show<00:05:34.449> it

00:05:34.620 --> 00:05:34.630 
the following steps I'm going to show it

00:05:34.630 --> 00:05:35.100 
the following steps I'm going to show it
to<00:05:34.750> you

00:05:35.100 --> 00:05:35.110 
to you

00:05:35.110 --> 00:05:37.469 
to you
show<00:05:35.889> you<00:05:35.949> the<00:05:36.159> steps<00:05:36.400> from<00:05:36.639> a<00:05:36.819> program<00:05:37.240> called

00:05:37.469 --> 00:05:37.479 
show you the steps from a program called

00:05:37.479 --> 00:05:40.939 
show you the steps from a program called
red<00:05:37.780> snow<00:05:38.080> which<00:05:38.319> is<00:05:38.500> a<00:05:38.530> jailbreaking<00:05:39.159> program

00:05:40.939 --> 00:05:40.949 
red snow which is a jailbreaking program

00:05:40.949 --> 00:05:54.510 
red snow which is a jailbreaking program
and<00:05:43.020> here<00:05:44.020> is<00:05:47.039> red<00:05:48.039> snow

00:05:54.510 --> 00:05:54.520

00:06:03.129 --> 00:06:03.139 
so you're going to follow these steps it

00:06:03.139 --> 00:06:05.820 
so you're going to follow these steps it
involves<00:06:03.740> first<00:06:04.100> powering<00:06:04.550> your<00:06:04.580> device<00:06:04.940> off
