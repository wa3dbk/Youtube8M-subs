00:04:12.650 --> 00:04:12.660 
zero to 180 I believe as you can see it

00:04:12.660 --> 00:04:14.900 
zero to 180 I believe as you can see it
gives<00:04:12.900> a<00:04:13.110> bit<00:04:13.260> of<00:04:13.380> crit<00:04:13.680> rate<00:04:13.860> and<00:04:14.070> minimum

00:04:14.900 --> 00:04:14.910 
gives a bit of crit rate and minimum

00:04:14.910 --> 00:04:19.490 
gives a bit of crit rate and minimum
crit<00:04:15.180> damage<00:04:15.330> which<00:04:16.080> is<00:04:16.200> pretty<00:04:16.590> nice<00:04:16.760> so<00:04:17.760> if<00:04:18.500> I

crit damage which is pretty nice so if I

00:04:19.500 --> 00:04:22.039

ignore that it's really nice those are
the<00:05:44.590> main<00:05:45.280> rings<00:05:45.520> that<00:05:45.700> I<00:05:45.730> use<00:05:47.400> and<00:05:48.400> over<00:05:48.610> here

00:05:48.780 --> 00:05:48.790 
the main rings that I use and over here

00:05:48.790 --> 00:05:52.950 
the main rings that I use and over here
I<00:05:48.820> have<00:05:49.150> a<00:05:49.570> couple<00:05:50.200> of<00:05:50.380> tops<00:05:50.790> now<00:05:51.790> this<00:05:52.750> one

00:05:52.950 --> 00:05:52.960 
I have a couple of tops now this one

00:05:52.960 --> 00:05:57.540 
I have a couple of tops now this one
down<00:05:53.410> here<00:05:53.470> is<00:05:54.000> my<00:05:55.000> invincibility<00:05:55.780> top<00:05:56.550> it

00:05:57.540 --> 00:05:57.550 
down here is my invincibility top it

00:05:57.550 --> 00:06:00.570 
down here is my invincibility top it
gives<00:05:57.820> me<00:05:58.030> three<00:05:58.570> well<00:05:59.380> two<00:05:59.740> plus<00:06:00.040> one<00:06:00.280> more

00:06:00.570 --> 00:06:00.580 
gives me three well two plus one more

00:06:00.580 --> 00:06:05.600 
gives me three well two plus one more
seconds<00:06:01.150> of<00:06:02.580> invincibility<00:06:03.580> after<00:06:04.150> I<00:06:04.210> get<00:06:04.300> hit

00:06:05.600 --> 00:06:05.610 
seconds of invincibility after I get hit

00:06:05.610 --> 00:06:10.980 
seconds of invincibility after I get hit
so<00:06:06.990> that<00:06:07.990> means<00:06:09.060> so<00:06:10.060> it's<00:06:10.180> really<00:06:10.330> handy<00:06:10.750> for
