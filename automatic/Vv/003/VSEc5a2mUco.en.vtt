00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.759
 hello my name is loshkarev andrew 

00:00:02.490 --> 00:00:08.849
 this project is all in mind at the construction site 

00:00:04.759 --> 00:00:13.110
 This is a continuation of the night fill 

00:00:08.849 --> 00:00:15.509
 concrete night casting basement here 

00:00:13.110 --> 00:00:18.840
 passed several hours and hours 

00:00:15.509 --> 00:00:20.730
 six seven i slept came to the object 

00:00:18.840 --> 00:00:21.779
 to see what we did and 

00:00:20.730 --> 00:00:24.630
 make measurements 

00:00:21.779 --> 00:00:25.230
 how exactly we've got to fill in 

00:00:24.630 --> 00:00:31.410
 foundation 

00:00:25.230 --> 00:00:37.969
 Now I will show you everything and so here is our 

00:00:31.410 --> 00:00:44.910
 ready foundation measuring 6 by 9 

00:00:37.969 --> 00:00:50.070
 which we poured the first since concrete 

00:00:44.910 --> 00:00:53.789
 we took one of the best but i hope 

00:00:50.070 --> 00:01:00.570
 the very best he has already become on it 

00:00:53.789 --> 00:01:07.519
 you can walk freely without any problems 

00:01:00.570 --> 00:01:07.519
 this is a gray spot here most likely 

00:01:08.390 --> 00:01:16.229
 how to say dimple yes I was here water 

00:01:12.330 --> 00:01:22.830
 this gray garbage you see this 

00:01:16.229 --> 00:01:27.259
 I don't know what the water is like 

00:01:22.830 --> 00:01:27.259
 it all dries up everything will become 

00:01:27.560 --> 00:01:30.560
 light gray 

00:01:33.679 --> 00:01:37.759
 so here 

00:01:52.520 --> 00:02:01.030
 how do you see the surface turned out 

00:01:54.590 --> 00:02:08.269
 very smooth with almost no trace of 

00:02:01.030 --> 00:02:10.910
 rules here here are years but how is it 

00:02:08.269 --> 00:02:15.700
 to tell you the accordion is that it is probably 

00:02:10.910 --> 00:02:15.700
 not more than a millimeter 

00:02:21.710 --> 00:02:29.990
 if suddenly on the finished foundation there 

00:02:25.520 --> 00:02:32.650
 some irregularities can be seen there 

00:02:29.990 --> 00:02:35.390
 such a tool it is called a helicopter 

00:02:32.650 --> 00:02:38.180
 that is, it is such a machine below it 

00:02:35.390 --> 00:02:40.820
 blades of youth are cut off by these blades 

00:02:38.180 --> 00:02:43.640
 all the irregularities are done and not then 

00:02:40.820 --> 00:02:45.470
 when concrete is laid exactly there on 

00:02:43.640 --> 00:02:48.860
 the next day or the day he 

00:02:45.470 --> 00:02:52.040
 already under the ear and can already be slightly up 

00:02:48.860 --> 00:02:55.880
 concrete sanded sanding machines 

00:02:52.040 --> 00:02:58.190
 here we do not need it here because 

00:02:55.880 --> 00:03:00.290
 that surface we got very 

00:02:58.190 --> 00:03:07.370
 even but how even 

00:03:00.290 --> 00:03:10.270
 make measurements and find out what happened with 

00:03:07.370 --> 00:03:12.220
 guys when they worked at night 

00:03:10.270 --> 00:03:15.830
 measurements will be done using 

00:03:12.220 --> 00:03:20.470
 optical level so I have already deployed 

00:03:15.830 --> 00:03:23.870
 Now I will set it up and shoot everything 

00:03:20.470 --> 00:03:27.140
 heights let's see what we have drops on 

00:03:23.870 --> 00:03:29.480
 I want measurements on this foundation 

00:03:27.140 --> 00:03:32.210
 measurements made using optical 

00:03:29.480 --> 00:03:33.880
 the level that is, we are here in this device 

00:03:32.210 --> 00:03:37.940
 if anyone knows how to use it 

00:03:33.880 --> 00:03:41.770
 We look like in the wine ring and there by 

00:03:37.940 --> 00:03:44.990
 midpoint we have a line this is the level 

00:03:41.770 --> 00:03:49.400
 certain single level and person 

00:03:44.990 --> 00:03:51.770
 Here with a ruler walks on the foundation I 

00:03:49.400 --> 00:03:54.740
 I see a number like here we had 

00:03:51.770 --> 00:03:56.240
 level there is the 119th I am carrying efron 

00:03:54.740 --> 00:03:59.210
 represents another place i see 

00:03:56.240 --> 00:04:03.890
 for example 119 half that means on the floor 

00:03:59.210 --> 00:04:06.110
 centimeter below if i see for example 118 

00:04:03.890 --> 00:04:09.290
 and a half means half a centimeter 

00:04:06.110 --> 00:04:10.750
 above and so i checked 

00:04:09.290 --> 00:04:14.140
 all the foundation 

00:04:10.750 --> 00:04:15.710
 approximately every there 50 60 centimeters 

00:04:14.140 --> 00:04:19.760
 here 

00:04:15.710 --> 00:04:22.490
 about the results and he will now tell so 

00:04:19.760 --> 00:04:26.240
 I was frankly pleased with the results 

00:04:22.490 --> 00:04:28.880
 Well done guys , just super 

00:04:26.240 --> 00:04:34.040
 I think that even smoother to do 

00:04:28.880 --> 00:04:36.020
 impossible to drop from somewhere on 

00:04:34.040 --> 00:04:40.250
 a distance of two or three meters is 

00:04:36.020 --> 00:04:43.690
 only 3 4 5 millimeters it is the entire length 

00:04:40.250 --> 00:04:48.380
 foundation is only 1 centimeter 

00:04:43.690 --> 00:04:54.010
 I do not know if it is good by your standards, but 

00:04:48.380 --> 00:04:54.010
 we consider this to be excellent 

00:04:55.270 --> 00:05:01.460
 so here is the geometry of the foundation 

00:04:58.940 --> 00:05:03.410
 looks like this start 

00:05:01.460 --> 00:05:07.000
 the foundation here is this side which i 

00:05:03.410 --> 00:05:09.740
 showing up to gray spots here 

00:05:07.000 --> 00:05:10.640
 absolute zero practically there is one or two 

00:05:09.740 --> 00:05:14.960
 millimeter 

00:05:10.640 --> 00:05:18.290
 jumping level where there is a gray spot yes 

00:05:14.960 --> 00:05:23.870
 here is this plot he is somewhere else 

00:05:18.290 --> 00:05:27.620
 adds 2-3 millimeters and further we 

00:05:23.870 --> 00:05:30.230
 another couple millimeters is added and 

00:05:27.620 --> 00:05:34.400
 difference here from this side 

00:05:30.230 --> 00:05:35.120
 until that side is only 1 

00:05:34.400 --> 00:05:39.860
 centimeter 

00:05:35.120 --> 00:05:42.380
 length here is 9 meters that is, we are here 

00:05:39.860 --> 00:05:45.550
 we will build a frame house here 

00:05:42.380 --> 00:05:50.390
 and even if you build a gas concrete house 

00:05:45.550 --> 00:05:52.600
 such a level is quite the foundation 

00:05:50.390 --> 00:05:57.950
 until it fits without there 

00:05:52.600 --> 00:06:00.310
 leveling masonry mortars and so 

00:05:57.950 --> 00:06:00.310
 Further 

00:06:02.860 --> 00:06:09.729
 and a few words how it all happened 

00:06:08.590 --> 00:06:12.280
 because 

00:06:09.729 --> 00:06:15.580
 and at night there is nothing on the night shoot 

00:06:12.280 --> 00:06:17.680
 nothing was visible here this pile of sand 

00:06:15.580 --> 00:06:25.110
 which was a spotlight 

00:06:17.680 --> 00:06:29.639
 and here this ladder from which I did 

00:06:25.110 --> 00:06:29.639
 frames and shooting from a height 

00:06:31.650 --> 00:06:37.629
 concrete mixers on consisted here for 

00:06:34.360 --> 00:06:42.509
 ravine on the road and through these pines 

00:06:37.629 --> 00:06:45.509
 Here are the broken branches of the concrete pump 

00:06:42.509 --> 00:06:45.509
 missed 

00:06:49.020 --> 00:06:56.490
 but I don't know what to call it a trunk. 

00:06:51.419 --> 00:07:02.400
 whether on the plot in general here in such conditions 

00:06:56.490 --> 00:07:05.669
 it was all a story with a foundation 

00:07:02.400 --> 00:07:09.240
 finished building continues guys 

00:07:05.669 --> 00:07:12.330
 get thanks she's for real 

00:07:09.240 --> 00:07:16.280
 feat at night and with you I 

00:07:12.330 --> 00:07:16.280
 goodbye see you soon
