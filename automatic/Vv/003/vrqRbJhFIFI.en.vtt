on the implement the sunflower 1400
series<00:00:46.339> has<00:00:46.519> three<00:00:46.820> different<00:00:47.030> attaching

00:00:47.680 --> 00:00:47.690

points low medium and high drawbar come
in<00:00:52.070> draw<00:00:52.430> bars<00:00:52.670> come<00:00:52.909> in<00:00:53.059> varying<00:00:53.479> height<00:00:53.780> so

00:00:54.040 --> 00:00:54.050 
in draw bars come in varying height so

00:00:54.050 --> 00:00:55.660 
in draw bars come in varying height so
we<00:00:54.290> want<00:00:54.530> to<00:00:54.680> be<00:00:54.890> sure<00:00:55.100> that<00:00:55.309> we're<00:00:55.460> pulling

00:00:55.660 --> 00:00:55.670 
we want to be sure that we're pulling

00:00:55.670 --> 00:00:57.490 
we want to be sure that we're pulling
the<00:00:56.059> tongue<00:00:56.330> of<00:00:56.510> the<00:00:56.540> unit<00:00:56.900> in<00:00:57.050> straight

00:00:57.490 --> 00:00:57.500 
the tongue of the unit in straight

00:00:57.500 --> 00:00:59.140 
the tongue of the unit in straight
fashion<00:00:57.769> parallel<00:00:58.430> to<00:00:58.580> the<00:00:58.699> ground

00:00:59.140 --> 00:00:59.150 
fashion parallel to the ground

00:00:59.150 --> 00:01:01.149 
fashion parallel to the ground
so<00:00:59.809> if<00:00:59.900> our<00:00:59.989> drawbar<00:01:00.409> in<00:01:00.589> this<00:01:00.710> case<00:01:00.920> is<00:01:01.070> about

00:01:01.149 --> 00:01:01.159 
so if our drawbar in this case is about

00:01:01.159 --> 00:01:02.950 
so if our drawbar in this case is about
19<00:01:01.670> and<00:01:01.820> 1/2<00:01:01.909> we're<00:01:02.360> going<00:01:02.479> to<00:01:02.540> be<00:01:02.690> in<00:01:02.839> the

19 and 1/2 we're going to be in the
center

00:01:03.579 --> 00:01:03.589

attaching<00:01:04.549> point<00:01:05.000> so<00:01:05.720> that<00:01:05.870> we're<00:01:05.990> not

00:01:06.070 --> 00:01:06.080 
attaching point so that we're not

00:01:06.080 --> 00:01:07.899

00:01:47.869 --> 00:01:50.620 
now we're ready to level the unit side
to<00:01:48.020> side<00:01:48.729> we're<00:01:49.729> gonna<00:01:49.789> raise<00:01:50.060> the<00:01:50.240> unit<00:01:50.479> all

00:01:50.620 --> 00:01:50.630 
to side we're gonna raise the unit all

00:01:50.630 --> 00:01:52.510 
to side we're gonna raise the unit all
the<00:01:50.659> way<00:01:50.840> up<00:01:51.049> let<00:01:51.920> it<00:01:51.950> down

00:01:52.510 --> 00:01:52.520 
the way up let it down

00:01:52.520 --> 00:01:54.520 
the way up let it down
watch<00:01:52.999> these<00:01:53.299> cylinders<00:01:53.630> to<00:01:53.899> make<00:01:54.079> sure<00:01:54.289> that

00:01:54.520 --> 00:01:54.530 
watch these cylinders to make sure that

00:01:54.530 --> 00:01:56.319 
watch these cylinders to make sure that
they<00:01:54.649> all<00:01:54.829> move<00:01:55.159> in<00:01:55.340> unison<00:01:55.520> we're<00:01:56.149> going<00:01:56.270> to

00:01:56.319 --> 00:01:56.329 
they all move in unison we're going to

00:01:56.329 --> 00:01:58.060 
they all move in unison we're going to
lower<00:01:56.630> the<00:01:56.869> implement<00:01:57.320> down<00:01:57.469> to<00:01:57.710> where<00:01:57.920> the

00:01:58.060 --> 00:01:58.070 
lower the implement down to where the

00:01:58.070 --> 00:02:00.160 
lower the implement down to where the
blades<00:01:58.369> almost<00:01:59.060> touch<00:01:59.359> the<00:01:59.570> ground<00:01:59.810> but<00:01:59.990> they

00:02:00.160 --> 00:02:00.170 
blades almost touch the ground but they

00:02:00.170 --> 00:02:04.599 
blades almost touch the ground but they
not<00:02:01.070> quite<00:02:01.490> so<00:02:01.969> we're<00:02:02.810> going<00:02:03.020> to<00:02:03.109> adjust<00:02:04.039> our

00:02:04.599 --> 00:02:04.609 
not quite so we're going to adjust our

00:02:04.609 --> 00:02:07.149 
not quite so we're going to adjust our
four<00:02:04.909> and<00:02:05.060> a<00:02:05.090> half<00:02:05.119> level<00:02:05.719> and<00:02:06.049> get<00:02:06.770> the<00:02:06.920> front

00:02:07.149 --> 00:02:07.159 
four and a half level and get the front

00:02:07.159 --> 00:02:09.130 
four and a half level and get the front
gang<00:02:07.399> and<00:02:07.670> the<00:02:07.789> rear<00:02:07.969> gang<00:02:08.210> equal<00:02:08.660> distance

gang and the rear gang equal distance
from<00:02:09.319> the<00:02:09.619> soil<00:02:09.950> and<00:02:10.220> then<00:02:11.030> we<00:02:11.210> can<00:02:11.390> start

00:02:11.650 --> 00:02:11.660 
from the soil and then we can start

00:02:11.660 --> 00:02:17.020 
from the soil and then we can start
measuring<00:02:12.910> our<00:02:13.910> wheel<00:02:14.530> pipe<00:02:15.530> from<00:02:16.220> the<00:02:16.430> main
