ready for 3d printing or laser cutting
at<00:02:11.900> this<00:02:12.230> point<00:02:12.500> you<00:02:13.459> have<00:02:13.640> two<00:02:13.790> options<00:02:13.819> you

00:02:14.440 --> 00:02:14.450 
at this point you have two options you

00:02:14.450 --> 00:02:16.840 
at this point you have two options you
can<00:02:14.600> either<00:02:14.750> have<00:02:15.470> the<00:02:15.590> skills<00:02:15.890> using<00:02:16.610> a

00:02:16.840 --> 00:02:16.850 
can either have the skills using a

00:02:16.850 --> 00:02:19.120 
can either have the skills using a
software<00:02:17.180> like<00:02:17.360> SolidWorks<00:02:17.900> rhino<00:02:18.260> or<00:02:18.590> Google

00:02:19.120 --> 00:02:19.130 
software like SolidWorks rhino or Google

00:02:19.130 --> 00:02:20.740 
software like SolidWorks rhino or Google
Sketchup<00:02:19.340> and<00:02:19.670> you<00:02:20.060> start<00:02:20.330> from<00:02:20.450> scratch

00:02:20.740 --> 00:02:20.750 
Sketchup and you start from scratch

00:02:20.750 --> 00:02:23.199 
Sketchup and you start from scratch
using<00:02:21.140> all<00:02:21.590> these<00:02:21.830> geometrical<00:02:22.489> objects<00:02:22.850> cube

00:02:23.199 --> 00:02:23.209 
using all these geometrical objects cube

00:02:23.209 --> 00:02:25.660 
using all these geometrical objects cube
squares<00:02:23.570> and<00:02:23.750> stuff<00:02:24.230> like<00:02:24.380> that<00:02:24.440> and<00:02:24.800> you

00:02:25.660 --> 00:02:25.670 
squares and stuff like that and you

00:02:25.670 --> 00:02:28.090 
squares and stuff like that and you
create<00:02:26.000> the<00:02:26.090> object<00:02:26.150> from<00:02:26.510> scratch<00:02:27.110> turning

00:02:28.090 --> 00:02:28.100 
create the object from scratch turning

00:02:28.100 --> 00:02:30.340 
create the object from scratch turning
that<00:02:28.190> into<00:02:28.370> a<00:02:28.550> complicated<00:02:29.360> object<00:02:29.690> or<00:02:29.840> you

00:02:30.340 --> 00:02:30.350 
that into a complicated object or you

00:02:30.350 --> 00:02:34.059 
that into a complicated object or you
can<00:02:30.560> get<00:02:30.709> things<00:02:31.000> 3d<00:02:32.000> scans<00:02:32.330> so<00:02:33.110> these<00:02:33.769> two

00:02:34.059 --> 00:02:34.069 
can get things 3d scans so these two

00:02:34.069 --> 00:02:36.370 
can get things 3d scans so these two
approaches<00:02:34.540> would<00:02:35.540> appeal<00:02:35.870> to<00:02:35.900> different

00:02:36.370 --> 00:02:36.380 
approaches would appeal to different

00:02:36.380 --> 00:02:40.410 
approaches would appeal to different
kinds<00:02:36.860> of<00:02:36.920> people

00:02:40.410 --> 00:02:40.420
