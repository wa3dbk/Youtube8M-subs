00:00:38.519 --> 00:00:43.279 

iodine's<00:00:39.519> because<00:00:40.120> of<00:00:40.449> several<00:00:41.230> reasons<00:00:41.620> ah

00:00:43.279 --> 00:00:43.289 
iodine's because of several reasons ah

00:00:43.289 --> 00:00:46.829 
iodine's because of several reasons ah
one<00:00:44.289> would<00:00:44.500> be<00:00:44.530> because<00:00:45.489> it's<00:00:45.820> a<00:00:46.030> soft<00:00:46.570> to<00:00:46.719> me

00:00:46.829 --> 00:00:46.839 
one would be because it's a soft to me

00:00:46.839 --> 00:00:50.970 
one would be because it's a soft to me
it's<00:00:47.019> a<00:00:47.140> way<00:00:47.289> of<00:00:47.320> keeping<00:00:47.620> balance<00:00:48.010> in<00:00:48.460> life<00:00:49.980> to

00:00:50.970 --> 00:00:50.980 
it's a way of keeping balance in life to

00:00:50.980 --> 00:00:52.889 
it's a way of keeping balance in life to
put<00:00:51.100> it<00:00:51.129> simply<00:00:51.250> I<00:00:51.609> mean<00:00:51.789> I<00:00:51.909> believe<00:00:52.269> that<00:00:52.300> you

00:00:52.889 --> 00:00:52.899 
put it simply I mean I believe that you

00:00:52.899 --> 00:00:54.750 
put it simply I mean I believe that you
know<00:00:53.019> people<00:00:53.199> have<00:00:53.620> brain<00:00:54.070> when<00:00:54.339> people<00:00:54.640> have

00:00:54.750 --> 00:00:54.760 
know people have brain when people have

00:00:54.760 --> 00:00:57.509 
know people have brain when people have
muscles<00:00:55.360> and<00:00:56.019> so<00:00:56.799> it's<00:00:56.949> important<00:00:57.309> to<00:00:57.399> use

00:00:57.509 --> 00:00:57.519 
muscles and so it's important to use

00:00:57.519 --> 00:01:01.649 
muscles and so it's important to use
both<00:00:57.789> and<00:00:58.409> you<00:00:59.409> know<00:00:59.500> for<00:00:59.739> example<00:01:00.420> when<00:01:01.420> I<00:01:01.449> was

00:01:01.649 --> 00:01:01.659 
both and you know for example when I was

00:01:01.659 --> 00:01:04.469 
both and you know for example when I was
at<00:01:01.780> school<00:01:01.809> you<00:01:02.500> know<00:01:02.559> and<00:01:02.920> I<00:01:03.309> kept<00:01:03.579> so<00:01:04.030> you

00:01:04.469 --> 00:01:04.479 
at school you know and I kept so you

00:01:04.479 --> 00:01:06.090 
at school you know and I kept so you
know<00:01:04.600> reading<00:01:04.869> we're<00:01:05.170> doing<00:01:05.350> some<00:01:05.619> maths<00:01:05.830> and

00:01:06.090 --> 00:01:06.100 
know reading we're doing some maths and

00:01:06.100 --> 00:01:07.620 
know reading we're doing some maths and
stuff<00:01:06.280> and<00:01:06.460> you<00:01:06.640> know<00:01:06.670> after<00:01:07.060> a<00:01:07.240> while<00:01:07.360> we<00:01:07.479> get

00:01:07.620 --> 00:01:07.630 
stuff and you know after a while we get

00:01:07.630 --> 00:01:10.440 
stuff and you know after a while we get
fed<00:01:07.990> up<00:01:08.020> with<00:01:08.289> it<00:01:08.380> so<00:01:09.250> now<00:01:09.429> you<00:01:09.490> go<00:01:09.909> and<00:01:10.119> dance

00:01:10.440 --> 00:01:10.450 
fed up with it so now you go and dance

00:01:10.450 --> 00:01:12.359 
fed up with it so now you go and dance
for<00:01:10.720> a<00:01:10.750> while<00:01:10.840> and<00:01:11.080> then<00:01:11.619> you<00:01:11.860> can<00:01:12.039> come<00:01:12.190> back

00:01:12.359 --> 00:01:12.369 
for a while and then you can come back

00:01:12.369 --> 00:01:14.070 
for a while and then you can come back
to<00:01:12.580> it<00:01:12.729> doing<00:01:13.119> work<00:01:13.330> you<00:01:13.569> know<00:01:13.659> doing<00:01:13.840> maths

00:01:14.070 --> 00:01:14.080 
to it doing work you know doing maths

00:01:14.080 --> 00:01:18.210 
to it doing work you know doing maths
because<00:01:14.440> it's<00:01:14.920> so<00:01:15.069> you<00:01:15.880> rest<00:01:16.210> from<00:01:16.539> dancing<00:01:17.220> so

00:01:18.210 --> 00:01:18.220 
because it's so you rest from dancing so

00:01:18.220 --> 00:01:20.130 
because it's so you rest from dancing so
yes<00:01:18.399> so<00:01:18.580> that's<00:01:18.789> one<00:01:19.000> reason<00:01:19.179> I<00:01:19.509> mean<00:01:19.659> another

00:01:20.130 --> 00:01:20.140 
yes so that's one reason I mean another

00:01:20.140 --> 00:01:24.210 
yes so that's one reason I mean another
would<00:01:20.500> be<00:01:22.409> for<00:01:23.409> me<00:01:23.530> it's<00:01:23.649> very<00:01:23.679> important<00:01:24.190> to

00:01:24.210 --> 00:01:24.220 
would be for me it's very important to

00:01:24.220 --> 00:01:26.460 
would be for me it's very important to
keep<00:01:24.460> fit<00:01:24.759> in<00:01:25.090> it<00:01:25.539> just<00:01:25.659> feels<00:01:25.960> great<00:01:26.200> so

00:01:26.460 --> 00:01:26.470 
keep fit in it just feels great so

00:01:26.470 --> 00:01:28.680 
keep fit in it just feels great so
that's<00:01:26.890> why<00:01:27.159> that's<00:01:27.460> as<00:01:27.610> well<00:01:27.789> and<00:01:28.000> did<00:01:28.450> break

00:01:28.680 --> 00:01:28.690 
that's why that's as well and did break

00:01:28.690 --> 00:01:31.889 
that's why that's as well and did break
dance<00:01:28.929> especially<00:01:29.590> is<00:01:30.130> a<00:01:30.360> good<00:01:31.360> way<00:01:31.569> of<00:01:31.600> doing

00:01:31.889 --> 00:01:31.899 
dance especially is a good way of doing

00:01:31.899 --> 00:01:36.480 
dance especially is a good way of doing
that<00:01:32.170> um<00:01:32.880> and<00:01:33.880> also<00:01:34.319> it's<00:01:35.319> a<00:01:35.530> way<00:01:36.130> of<00:01:36.159> being

00:01:36.480 --> 00:01:36.490 
that um and also it's a way of being

00:01:36.490 --> 00:01:39.380 
that um and also it's a way of being
creative<00:01:37.030> so<00:01:37.600> why<00:01:38.229> is<00:01:38.259> very<00:01:38.709> important<00:01:39.130> to<00:01:39.159> me

00:01:39.380 --> 00:01:39.390 
creative so why is very important to me

00:01:39.390 --> 00:01:46.190 
creative so why is very important to me
yeah

00:01:46.190 --> 00:01:46.200 

00:01:46.200 --> 00:01:50.510 

I<00:01:48.200> think<00:01:49.200> I<00:01:49.320> could<00:01:49.380> become<00:01:49.770> a<00:01:49.799> quick<00:01:50.070> dancer

00:01:50.510 --> 00:01:50.520 
I think I could become a quick dancer

00:01:50.520 --> 00:01:53.179 
I think I could become a quick dancer
but<00:01:50.969> we<00:01:51.750> sort<00:01:52.140> of<00:01:52.200> started<00:01:52.350> talking<00:01:52.920> with<00:01:53.070> my

00:01:53.179 --> 00:01:53.189 
but we sort of started talking with my

00:01:53.189 --> 00:01:55.219 
but we sort of started talking with my
that<00:01:53.399> and<00:01:53.640> he<00:01:53.909> said<00:01:53.939> you<00:01:54.390> know<00:01:54.420> I<00:01:54.719> thought<00:01:55.140> it

00:01:55.219 --> 00:01:55.229 
that and he said you know I thought it

00:01:55.229 --> 00:01:57.919 
that and he said you know I thought it
was<00:01:55.320> 20<00:01:55.560> at<00:01:56.039> that<00:01:56.219> time<00:01:56.460> because<00:01:57.450> you<00:01:57.719> know<00:01:57.840> you

00:01:57.919 --> 00:01:57.929 
was 20 at that time because you know you

00:01:57.929 --> 00:02:00.560 
was 20 at that time because you know you
need<00:01:58.079> a<00:01:58.110> lot<00:01:58.350> of<00:01:58.520> flexibility<00:01:59.520> and<00:01:59.789> all<00:02:00.179> other

00:02:00.560 --> 00:02:00.570 
need a lot of flexibility and all other

00:02:00.570 --> 00:02:03.529 
need a lot of flexibility and all other
stuff<00:02:00.899> it<00:02:01.890> was<00:02:02.100> a<00:02:02.130> bit<00:02:02.520> challenging<00:02:03.060> but<00:02:03.329> you

00:02:03.529 --> 00:02:03.539 
stuff it was a bit challenging but you

00:02:03.539 --> 00:02:05.210 
stuff it was a bit challenging but you
know<00:02:03.659> when<00:02:03.840> when<00:02:04.229> you<00:02:04.319> realize<00:02:04.679> something<00:02:05.100> it

00:02:05.210 --> 00:02:05.220 
know when when you realize something it

00:02:05.220 --> 00:02:12.440 
know when when you realize something it
doesn't<00:02:05.399> matter

00:02:12.440 --> 00:02:12.450 

00:02:12.450 --> 00:02:15.830 

it<00:02:13.260> makes<00:02:13.560> a<00:02:13.739> huge<00:02:13.890> difference<00:02:14.190> when<00:02:14.840> lowers

00:02:15.830 --> 00:02:15.840 
it makes a huge difference when lowers

00:02:15.840 --> 00:02:17.119 
it makes a huge difference when lowers
of<00:02:15.959> people<00:02:16.319> around<00:02:16.470> you<00:02:16.769> you<00:02:16.890> know<00:02:16.980> you're

00:02:17.119 --> 00:02:17.129

00:02:39.020 --> 00:02:39.030 
watching and just shouting and stuff I

00:02:39.030 --> 00:02:41.690 
watching and just shouting and stuff I
think<00:02:39.930> my<00:02:40.080> guess<00:02:40.260> katabi<00:02:40.739> was<00:02:41.280> not<00:02:41.489> very

00:02:41.690 --> 00:02:41.700

00:03:11.660 --> 00:03:11.670
