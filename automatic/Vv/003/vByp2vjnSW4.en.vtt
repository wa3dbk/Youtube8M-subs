this<00:01:44.810> is<00:01:45.049> an<00:01:45.260> opportunity<00:01:45.560> to<00:01:46.010> play<00:01:46.130> against<00:01:46.340> a

00:01:46.390 --> 00:01:46.400 
this is an opportunity to play against a

00:01:46.400 --> 00:01:47.859 
this is an opportunity to play against a
different<00:01:46.549> Japanese<00:01:47.090> team<00:01:47.270> actually<00:01:47.479> don't

00:01:47.859 --> 00:01:47.869 
different Japanese team actually don't

00:01:47.869 --> 00:01:49.600 
different Japanese team actually don't
think<00:01:47.960> they're<00:01:48.260> as<00:01:48.409> good<00:01:48.979> as<00:01:49.100> a<00:01:49.130> team<00:01:49.369> in<00:01:49.549> the

00:01:49.600 --> 00:01:49.610 
think they're as good as a team in the

00:01:49.610 --> 00:01:52.210 
think they're as good as a team in the
past<00:01:50.320> but<00:01:51.320> you<00:01:51.409> just<00:01:51.590> kind<00:01:51.799> of<00:01:51.860> never<00:01:52.040> know

00:01:52.210 --> 00:01:52.220 
past but you just kind of never know

00:01:52.220 --> 00:01:53.469 
past but you just kind of never know
what<00:01:52.340> you're<00:01:52.490> going<00:01:52.610> to<00:01:52.729> find<00:01:52.760> out<00:01:53.150> in<00:01:53.180> the<00:01:53.330> day

00:01:53.469 --> 00:01:53.479 
what you're going to find out in the day

00:01:53.479 --> 00:01:55.270 
what you're going to find out in the day
of<00:01:53.600> the<00:01:53.720> game<00:01:53.890> hopefully<00:01:54.890> a<00:01:54.950> little<00:01:55.040> bit<00:01:55.220> of

00:01:55.270 --> 00:01:55.280 
of the game hopefully a little bit of

00:01:55.280 --> 00:01:56.500 
of the game hopefully a little bit of
luck<00:01:55.430> we'll<00:01:55.580> be<00:01:55.670> on<00:01:55.760> our<00:01:55.820> side<00:01:55.940> but<00:01:56.270> I<00:01:56.330> think

00:01:56.500 --> 00:01:56.510 
luck we'll be on our side but I think

00:01:56.510 --> 00:02:00.310 
luck we'll be on our side but I think
were<00:01:56.570> the<00:01:56.600> better<00:01:56.780> team<00:01:58.630> this<00:01:59.630> Japanese<00:02:00.140> team

00:02:00.310 --> 00:02:00.320 
were the better team this Japanese team

00:02:00.320 --> 00:02:01.359 
were the better team this Japanese team
though<00:02:00.470> you<00:02:00.530> can<00:02:00.770> never<00:02:00.950> overestimate

00:02:01.359 --> 00:02:01.369 
though you can never overestimate

00:02:01.369 --> 00:02:03.940 
though you can never overestimate
because<00:02:02.119> they<00:02:02.270> are<00:02:02.390> always<00:02:02.840> so<00:02:03.110> technical<00:02:03.770> and

00:02:03.940 --> 00:02:03.950 
because they are always so technical and

00:02:03.950 --> 00:02:05.920 
because they are always so technical and
their<00:02:04.040> transition<00:02:04.790> and<00:02:04.970> they<00:02:05.090> always<00:02:05.450> can

00:02:05.920 --> 00:02:05.930 
their transition and they always can

00:02:05.930 --> 00:02:07.810 
their transition and they always can
come<00:02:06.110> up<00:02:06.290> a<00:02:06.470> you<00:02:06.770> know<00:02:06.890> the<00:02:07.100> US<00:02:07.369> was<00:02:07.520> winning

00:02:07.810 --> 00:02:07.820 
come up a you know the US was winning

00:02:07.820 --> 00:02:10.150 
come up a you know the US was winning
twice<00:02:08.149> in<00:02:08.479> 2011<00:02:09.259> and<00:02:09.380> found<00:02:09.619> a<00:02:09.770> way<00:02:09.890> to<00:02:09.950> come

00:02:10.150 --> 00:02:10.160 
twice in 2011 and found a way to come

00:02:10.160 --> 00:02:12.100 
twice in 2011 and found a way to come
back<00:02:10.340> into<00:02:10.520> the<00:02:10.640> game<00:02:10.759> the<00:02:11.360> u.s.<00:02:11.630> does<00:02:11.810> not

00:02:12.100 --> 00:02:12.110 
back into the game the u.s. does not

00:02:12.110 --> 00:02:14.290 
back into the game the u.s. does not
forget<00:02:12.410> that<00:02:12.590> Japan<00:02:13.340> is<00:02:13.370> such<00:02:13.730> a<00:02:13.760> good<00:02:14.060> team

00:02:14.290 --> 00:02:14.300
