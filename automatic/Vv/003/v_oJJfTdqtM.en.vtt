00:00:02.429 --> 00:00:07.170
 welcome to this your my android channel 

00:00:04.860 --> 00:00:09.540
 ams we bring you a new video this 

00:00:07.170 --> 00:00:11.400
 video is basic android like 

00:00:09.540 --> 00:00:13.410
 we have been doing this series them 

00:00:11.400 --> 00:00:16.019
 we will teach how to restore the 

00:00:13.410 --> 00:00:19.310
 factory values â€‹â€‹of your android so 

00:00:16.019 --> 00:00:19.310
 do not move we begin 

00:00:28.510 --> 00:00:32.980
 materials we will teach how to accept 

00:00:30.310 --> 00:00:35.140
 The factory settings of your phone is 

00:00:32.980 --> 00:00:38.140
 very important that you know where 

00:00:35.140 --> 00:00:40.090
 I included myself battled a lot for 

00:00:38.140 --> 00:00:43.570
 find where when I had my first 

00:00:40.090 --> 00:00:45.970
 android and this is the purpose 

00:00:43.570 --> 00:00:48.010
 of these videos not that people learn 

00:00:45.970 --> 00:00:50.020
 we already have a lot of time 

00:00:48.010 --> 00:00:51.730
 here and what we are going to 

00:00:50.020 --> 00:00:54.370
 teaching now is super simple there 

00:00:51.730 --> 00:00:56.590
 there are people who look for it and can not find it 

00:00:54.370 --> 00:00:59.410
 then let's make things a 

00:00:56.590 --> 00:01:01.089
 little easier that is the mentality 

00:00:59.410 --> 00:01:03.870
 that we have here on android 

00:01:01.089 --> 00:01:06.850
 apps so let's start with this is 

00:01:03.870 --> 00:01:09.370
 super simple as you can see 

00:01:06.850 --> 00:01:10.930
 here, I have everything, my desk 

00:01:09.370 --> 00:01:13.570
 with applications here I have some 

00:01:10.930 --> 00:01:16.360
 applications and I want to erase them 

00:01:13.570 --> 00:01:18.340
 because it does not work well or because it is 

00:01:16.360 --> 00:01:20.110
 very slow for x reason I want it 

00:01:18.340 --> 00:01:22.210
 leave as when you buy it and when 

00:01:20.110 --> 00:01:23.860
 I took out of the box the first time and how 

00:01:22.210 --> 00:01:24.700
 we are going to do it because very very very 

00:01:23.860 --> 00:01:26.190
 simple 

00:01:24.700 --> 00:01:28.150
 we come here to what is 

00:01:26.190 --> 00:01:30.100
 configuration 

00:01:28.150 --> 00:01:33.220
 there is a section here in the menu that says 

00:01:30.100 --> 00:01:35.830
 staff here we will give you where it says 

00:01:33.220 --> 00:01:37.600
 backup and reset here 

00:01:35.830 --> 00:01:39.640
 gives us several options we are going to give to 

00:01:37.600 --> 00:01:42.220
 the last one that says reset values 

00:01:39.640 --> 00:01:44.080
 factory when we give it there 

00:01:42.220 --> 00:01:45.940
 It gives us a warning and tells us what it is 

00:01:44.080 --> 00:01:47.740
 what is going to be deleted we make a 

00:01:45.940 --> 00:01:50.800
 support that we have to do 

00:01:47.740 --> 00:01:53.740
 obviously that the whole system is going to be 

00:01:50.800 --> 00:01:55.990
 well reset and going to all goes is going to 

00:01:53.740 --> 00:01:57.520
 erase so if you have not done 

00:01:55.990 --> 00:01:59.230
 your support before doing this 

00:01:57.520 --> 00:02:02.470
 procedure do it please if not 

00:01:59.230 --> 00:02:05.110
 they will lose everything ok this me in this 

00:02:02.470 --> 00:02:07.420
 nexos because I have no external memory 

00:02:05.110 --> 00:02:08.979
 I will not lose anything it will erase the 

00:02:07.420 --> 00:02:10.810
 system and it's going to reinstall but all 

00:02:08.979 --> 00:02:12.790
 what I have in me on my cell phone 

00:02:10.810 --> 00:02:13.810
 is going to continue there we are going to give you this 

00:02:12.790 --> 00:02:15.940
 button that says reset 

00:02:13.810 --> 00:02:18.910
 device asks us again that 

00:02:15.940 --> 00:02:21.190
 if we are sure in case we missed the 

00:02:18.910 --> 00:02:24.190
 wave for anything brings us back to 

00:02:21.190 --> 00:02:25.810
 ask when we are already sure of 

00:02:24.190 --> 00:02:26.750
 all that then we are going to give him eliminate 

00:02:25.810 --> 00:02:28.250
 all 

00:02:26.750 --> 00:02:31.270
 and what will be because the 

00:02:28.250 --> 00:02:35.100
 terminal is going to turn off 

00:02:31.270 --> 00:02:35.100
 let's give it a little time 

00:02:50.390 --> 00:02:55.270
 to start erasing and loading 

00:02:55.680 --> 00:02:59.909
 what he is doing is re installing the 

00:02:57.870 --> 00:03:02.150
 system and it's going to start again and it's going to 

00:02:59.909 --> 00:03:02.150
 to reset 

00:03:02.250 --> 00:03:07.110
 it's like when they install a custom room 

00:03:04.560 --> 00:03:08.790
 it's going to take a little bit because it 's the 

00:03:07.110 --> 00:03:11.340
 first time you turn on you are going to set 

00:03:08.790 --> 00:03:14.810
 everything so we have a little bit of 

00:03:11.340 --> 00:03:14.810
 I do not despair 

00:03:16.630 --> 00:03:20.880
 good and already in the system is us 

00:03:19.120 --> 00:03:23.740
 asking what language do we want 

00:03:20.880 --> 00:03:26.430
 choose we are going to give spanish to usa 

00:03:23.740 --> 00:03:26.430
 we start 

00:03:28.190 --> 00:03:33.200
 need to look for Wi-Fi networks are going to 

00:03:30.350 --> 00:03:37.120
 issue to do it faster we're going to 

00:03:33.200 --> 00:03:39.550
 issue anyway that this was not 

00:03:37.120 --> 00:03:41.480
 restore the factory defaults of this 

00:03:39.550 --> 00:03:43.730
 Android can do it with their 

00:03:41.480 --> 00:03:45.500
 terminals and they will not have any 

00:03:43.730 --> 00:03:47.960
 problem so we hope there will be 

00:03:45.500 --> 00:03:50.330
