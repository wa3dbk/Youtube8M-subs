about<00:00:31.140> 11<00:00:31.380> and<00:00:31.769> a<00:00:31.890> half<00:00:31.920> when<00:00:32.489> I<00:00:32.550> started

00:00:33.080 --> 00:00:33.090 
about 11 and a half when I started

00:00:33.090 --> 00:00:35.209 
about 11 and a half when I started
developing<00:00:33.630> well<00:00:34.200> I<00:00:34.230> started<00:00:34.739> small<00:00:35.160> with

00:00:35.209 --> 00:00:35.219 
developing well I started small with

00:00:35.219 --> 00:00:37.790 
developing well I started small with
console<00:00:36.090> applications<00:00:36.809> which<00:00:37.110> basically

00:00:37.790 --> 00:00:37.800 
console applications which basically

00:00:37.800 --> 00:00:40.490 
console applications which basically
show<00:00:38.160> text<00:00:38.760> and<00:00:38.969> then<00:00:39.450> I<00:00:39.600> stepped<00:00:40.050> it<00:00:40.230> up<00:00:40.320> to

00:00:40.490 --> 00:00:40.500 
show text and then I stepped it up to

00:00:40.500 --> 00:00:42.619 
show text and then I stepped it up to
windows<00:00:40.860> forms<00:00:41.460> which<00:00:41.790> you<00:00:42.090> can<00:00:42.300> get<00:00:42.480> the

00:00:42.619 --> 00:00:42.629 
windows forms which you can get the

00:00:42.629 --> 00:00:45.260 
windows forms which you can get the
input<00:00:42.989> from<00:00:43.200> users<00:00:43.649> and<00:00:43.920> then<00:00:44.399> from<00:00:44.760> that<00:00:44.820> I

00:00:45.260 --> 00:00:45.270 
input from users and then from that I

00:00:45.270 --> 00:00:49.190 
input from users and then from that I
went<00:00:45.600> to<00:00:45.719> XNA<00:00:46.350> on<00:00:46.890> my<00:00:47.489> zune<00:00:47.700> HD<00:00:47.969> and<00:00:48.539> then<00:00:48.930> when

00:00:49.190 --> 00:00:49.200 
went to XNA on my zune HD and then when

00:00:49.200 --> 00:00:52.069 
went to XNA on my zune HD and then when
I<00:00:49.350> was<00:00:49.649> able<00:00:49.860> to<00:00:50.070> develop<00:00:50.700> on<00:00:50.910> the<00:00:51.090> windows<00:00:51.420> 17

this<00:02:25.370> method<00:02:25.760> I<00:02:26.530> update<00:02:27.530> all<00:02:27.770> of<00:02:27.800> the<00:02:28.040> logic<00:02:28.580> on

00:02:28.780 --> 00:02:28.790 
this method I update all of the logic on

00:02:28.790 --> 00:02:31.300 
this method I update all of the logic on
the<00:02:28.970> screen<00:02:29.390> and<00:02:30.020> I<00:02:30.110> have<00:02:30.260> different<00:02:30.410> classes

00:02:31.300 --> 00:02:31.310 
the screen and I have different classes

00:02:31.310 --> 00:02:33.280

draw method I draw all of the objects

00:02:47.990 --> 00:02:51.430 
draw method I draw all of the objects
onto<00:02:48.260> the<00:02:48.530> screen<00:02:48.830> and<00:02:49.780> this<00:02:50.780> will<00:02:51.170> draw<00:02:51.200> the
