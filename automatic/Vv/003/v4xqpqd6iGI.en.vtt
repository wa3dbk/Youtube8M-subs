00:00:29.429 --> 00:00:35.040
 thiago who designed everything projector from 

00:00:32.790 --> 00:00:39.210
 The way I wanted it so,

00:00:44.640 --> 00:00:52.110
 him to cover the plumbing has this 

00:00:49.320 --> 00:00:57.270

00:00:57.270 --> 00:01:03.180
 I do not know what your name is. 

00:00:59.520 --> 00:01:07.619
 what is not to let it fall when 

00:01:03.180 --> 00:01:15.119
 open then you can let it not open 

00:01:07.619 --> 00:01:17.340

00:01:17.340 --> 00:01:25.020
 chic she also opens up to the very end 

00:01:21.210 --> 00:01:31.110

00:01:25.020 --> 00:01:33.979
 the first one he uses are large 

00:01:31.110 --> 00:01:38.360
 It's a bit of a mess, it's more normal. 

00:01:33.979 --> 00:01:38.360
 apartment in reforms always tried 

00:01:38.900 --> 00:01:43.310
 cool to a drawer but dinho 

00:01:43.970 --> 00:01:56.009
 this part is that part has also think 

00:01:51.840 --> 00:01:58.860
 well cool that part that is covered 

00:01:56.009 --> 00:02:01.049
 that is underneath the stove is actually 

00:01:58.860 --> 00:02:01.799
 the oven as we do not have the 

00:02:01.049 --> 00:02:04.619
 oven 

00:02:01.799 --> 00:02:08.099
 then he left it covered later when 

00:02:04.619 --> 00:02:11.580
 to arrive he arranges right there is a 

00:02:08.099 --> 00:02:15.150
 little space I asked to let go 

00:02:11.580 --> 00:02:19.080
 watercolor po plate plan not to stay 

00:02:15.150 --> 00:02:21.330
 spread out next to where you will be 

00:02:19.080 --> 00:02:26.010
 wash and dry 

00:02:21.330 --> 00:02:30.450
 who does not have the same is the other's 

00:02:26.010 --> 00:02:32.100
 part of the cupboard very spacious everything very 

00:02:30.450 --> 00:02:34.560
 spacious 

00:02:32.100 --> 00:02:37.380
 although the apartment is very thin 

00:02:34.560 --> 00:02:40.110
 the kitchen has been closed down, at least 

00:02:37.380 --> 00:02:43.830
 I had so enjoyed every 

00:02:40.110 --> 00:02:47.580
 space since the other bodies the people 

00:02:43.830 --> 00:02:50.180
 It's not going to be nice, it's cool 

00:02:47.580 --> 00:02:52.860
 This is a black glass 

00:02:50.180 --> 00:02:54.120
 there he was careful to put 

00:02:52.860 --> 00:02:56.700
 the arm 

00:02:54.120 --> 00:03:00.030
 so even if you let it go it does not go down 

00:02:56.700 --> 00:03:10.370
 O yet it will slow down to 

00:03:00.030 --> 00:03:10.370
 close up , fuse 

00:03:14.380 --> 00:03:21.110
 It was really nice, nice people, like this. 

00:03:18.410 --> 00:03:24.650
 It's the care he had to do. 

00:03:21.110 --> 00:03:26.480
 all the details also the several times 

00:03:24.650 --> 00:03:29.180

00:03:38.090 --> 00:03:41.959
