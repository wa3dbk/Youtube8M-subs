well hello there it is frozen swipe and
I've<00:00:02.669> got<00:00:02.820> a<00:00:02.850> very<00:00:03.090> important<00:00:03.540> discovery<00:00:03.929> for

00:00:04.130 --> 00:00:04.140 
I've got a very important discovery for

00:00:04.140 --> 00:00:06.110 
I've got a very important discovery for
me<00:00:04.170> to<00:00:04.290> share<00:00:04.440> with<00:00:04.589> you<00:00:04.710> guys<00:00:04.740> today<00:00:04.890> and<00:00:05.370> this

me to share with you guys today and this

00:00:06.120 --> 00:00:07.610 
me to share with you guys today and this
is<00:00:06.240> something<00:00:06.330> i<00:00:06.540> don't<00:00:06.750> think<00:00:06.899> anyone<00:00:07.379> else

00:00:07.610 --> 00:00:07.620 
is something i don't think anyone else

00:00:07.620 --> 00:00:10.759 
is something i don't think anyone else
has<00:00:07.919> pulled<00:00:08.670> out<00:00:08.790> there<00:00:09.000> yes<00:00:09.300> so<00:00:09.660> i<00:00:10.019> think<00:00:10.530> i

00:00:10.759 --> 00:00:10.769 
has pulled out there yes so i think i

00:00:10.769 --> 00:00:12.129 
has pulled out there yes so i think i
may<00:00:10.920> be<00:00:10.980> one<00:00:11.190> of<00:00:11.219> the<00:00:11.309> first<00:00:11.490> people<00:00:11.820> to

00:00:12.129 --> 00:00:12.139 
may be one of the first people to

00:00:12.139 --> 00:00:14.900 
may be one of the first people to
discover<00:00:13.139> this<00:00:13.559> but<00:00:14.250> i<00:00:14.280> was<00:00:14.460> watching<00:00:14.700> a<00:00:14.759> video

00:00:14.900 --> 00:00:14.910 
discover this but i was watching a video

00:00:14.910 --> 00:00:17.439 
discover this but i was watching a video
of<00:00:15.059> drifters<00:00:15.450> where<00:00:15.780> he<00:00:16.139> was<00:00:16.529> testing<00:00:17.070> how<00:00:17.310> the

00:00:17.439 --> 00:00:17.449 
of drifters where he was testing how the

00:00:17.449 --> 00:00:21.050 
of drifters where he was testing how the
KSG<00:00:18.449> shotgun<00:00:19.140> is<00:00:19.350> inaccurate<00:00:19.939> after<00:00:20.939> you

00:00:21.050 --> 00:00:21.060 
KSG shotgun is inaccurate after you

00:00:21.060 --> 00:00:23.509 
KSG shotgun is inaccurate after you
crouch<00:00:21.480> and<00:00:21.779> prone<00:00:22.230> and<00:00:22.500> i<00:00:22.859> went<00:00:23.039> to<00:00:23.160> newton

00:00:23.509 --> 00:00:23.519 
crouch and prone and i went to newton

00:00:23.519 --> 00:00:25.490 
crouch and prone and i went to newton
here<00:00:23.760> and<00:00:23.970> i<00:00:24.029> replicated<00:00:24.570> his<00:00:24.869> experiments

00:00:25.490 --> 00:00:25.500 
here and i replicated his experiments

00:00:25.500 --> 00:00:27.620 
here and i replicated his experiments
with<00:00:25.619> the<00:00:25.710> KSG<00:00:26.010> shotgun<00:00:26.609> to<00:00:27.029> find<00:00:27.269> that<00:00:27.449> of

00:00:27.620 --> 00:00:27.630 
with the KSG shotgun to find that of

00:00:27.630 --> 00:00:30.470 
with the KSG shotgun to find that of
course<00:00:27.840> it<00:00:28.080> was<00:00:28.230> true<00:00:28.500> and<00:00:28.710> then<00:00:29.609> i<00:00:29.640> decided<00:00:30.060> to

00:00:30.470 --> 00:00:30.480 
course it was true and then i decided to

00:00:30.480 --> 00:00:33.770 
course it was true and then i decided to
try<00:00:31.080> some<00:00:31.800> of<00:00:31.830> the<00:00:32.040> other<00:00:32.219> weapons<00:00:32.669> and<00:00:32.850> while

00:00:33.770 --> 00:00:33.780 
try some of the other weapons and while

00:00:33.780 --> 00:00:35.360 
try some of the other weapons and while
i<00:00:33.809> haven't<00:00:34.170> tested<00:00:34.350> every<00:00:34.800> single<00:00:35.100> weapon<00:00:35.219> in

00:00:35.360 --> 00:00:35.370 
i haven't tested every single weapon in

00:00:35.370 --> 00:00:37.580 
i haven't tested every single weapon in
the<00:00:35.460> game<00:00:35.610> i<00:00:35.820> did<00:00:36.030> test<00:00:36.360> a<00:00:36.660> good<00:00:37.050> variety<00:00:37.230> of

00:00:37.580 --> 00:00:37.590 
the game i did test a good variety of

00:00:37.590 --> 00:00:39.139 
the game i did test a good variety of
weapons<00:00:37.800> covering<00:00:38.399> all<00:00:38.610> of<00:00:38.640> the<00:00:38.790> different

00:00:39.139 --> 00:00:39.149 
weapons covering all of the different

00:00:39.149 --> 00:00:42.020 
weapons covering all of the different
weapon<00:00:39.450> classes<00:00:39.690> and<00:00:40.250> what<00:00:41.250> i<00:00:41.280> found<00:00:41.670> is<00:00:41.969> that

00:00:42.020 --> 00:00:42.030 
weapon classes and what i found is that

00:00:42.030 --> 00:00:44.869 
weapon classes and what i found is that
it<00:00:42.690> pretty<00:00:43.170> much<00:00:43.440> affects<00:00:43.590> every<00:00:44.550> single

00:00:44.869 --> 00:00:44.879 
it pretty much affects every single

00:00:44.879 --> 00:00:46.340 
it pretty much affects every single
weapon<00:00:45.000> in<00:00:45.210> the<00:00:45.300> game<00:00:45.480> apart<00:00:46.079> from<00:00:46.200> the

00:00:46.340 --> 00:00:46.350 
weapon in the game apart from the

00:00:46.350 --> 00:00:48.110 
weapon in the game apart from the
ballistic<00:00:46.739> knife<00:00:46.770> the<00:00:47.039> ballistic<00:00:47.430> knife<00:00:47.460> was

00:00:48.110 --> 00:00:48.120 
ballistic knife the ballistic knife was

00:00:48.120 --> 00:00:49.490 
ballistic knife the ballistic knife was
the<00:00:48.210> only<00:00:48.360> weapon<00:00:48.660> that<00:00:48.690> I<00:00:48.809> tested<00:00:49.050> where<00:00:49.410> it

00:00:49.490 --> 00:00:49.500 
the only weapon that I tested where it

00:00:49.500 --> 00:00:51.290 
the only weapon that I tested where it
didn't<00:00:49.770> work<00:00:49.950> apart<00:00:50.340> from<00:00:50.430> that<00:00:50.520> all<00:00:50.879> of<00:00:51.180> the

00:00:51.290 --> 00:00:51.300 
didn't work apart from that all of the

00:00:51.300 --> 00:00:53.470 
didn't work apart from that all of the
other<00:00:51.449> weapons<00:00:51.809> were<00:00:51.960> affected<00:00:52.440> by<00:00:52.469> this<00:00:52.620> and

00:00:53.470 --> 00:00:53.480 
other weapons were affected by this and

00:00:53.480 --> 00:00:55.340 
other weapons were affected by this and
including<00:00:54.480> even<00:00:54.600> the<00:00:54.719> launchers<00:00:55.230> the

00:00:55.340 --> 00:00:55.350 
including even the launchers the

00:00:55.350 --> 00:00:57.950 
including even the launchers the
launchers<00:00:55.710> were<00:00:55.739> much<00:00:56.070> harder<00:00:56.520> to<00:00:56.670> test<00:00:56.879> I<00:00:57.149> did

00:00:57.950 --> 00:00:57.960 
launchers were much harder to test I did

00:00:57.960 --> 00:00:59.299 
launchers were much harder to test I did
feel<00:00:58.140> that<00:00:58.320> the<00:00:58.410> Rockets<00:00:58.739> were<00:00:58.859> going<00:00:59.129> off

00:00:59.299 --> 00:00:59.309 
feel that the Rockets were going off

00:00:59.309 --> 00:01:01.160 
feel that the Rockets were going off
their<00:00:59.640> initial<00:01:00.210> trajectory<00:01:00.300> they<00:01:00.960> weren't

00:01:01.160 --> 00:01:01.170 
their initial trajectory they weren't

00:01:01.170 --> 00:01:03.139 
their initial trajectory they weren't
going<00:01:01.530> exactly<00:01:01.829> where<00:01:02.100> I<00:01:02.370> was<00:01:02.640> aiming<00:01:02.879> them

00:01:03.139 --> 00:01:03.149 
going exactly where I was aiming them

00:01:03.149 --> 00:01:05.179 
going exactly where I was aiming them
I'm<00:01:03.690> not<00:01:03.870> entirely<00:01:04.170> sold<00:01:04.530> on<00:01:04.710> the<00:01:04.799> launchers

00:01:05.179 --> 00:01:05.189 
I'm not entirely sold on the launchers

00:01:05.189 --> 00:01:07.190 
I'm not entirely sold on the launchers
because<00:01:05.489> it's<00:01:06.000> they're<00:01:06.390> really<00:01:06.630> hard<00:01:06.780> to<00:01:06.900> test

00:01:07.190 --> 00:01:07.200 
because it's they're really hard to test

00:01:07.200 --> 00:01:08.899 
because it's they're really hard to test
and<00:01:07.560> I<00:01:07.710> do<00:01:07.979> know<00:01:08.340> that<00:01:08.369> they<00:01:08.670> can<00:01:08.820> be

00:01:08.899 --> 00:01:08.909 
and I do know that they can be

00:01:08.909 --> 00:01:10.580 
and I do know that they can be
inconsistent<00:01:09.360> at<00:01:09.630> times<00:01:09.659> but<00:01:10.290> I'm<00:01:10.380> going<00:01:10.530> to

00:01:10.580 --> 00:01:10.590 
inconsistent at times but I'm going to

00:01:10.590 --> 00:01:12.320 
inconsistent at times but I'm going to
say<00:01:10.740> that<00:01:10.920> the<00:01:11.010> most<00:01:11.250> likely<00:01:11.640> affects<00:01:11.939> them<00:01:12.150> as

00:01:12.320 --> 00:01:12.330 
say that the most likely affects them as

00:01:12.330 --> 00:01:14.210 
say that the most likely affects them as
well<00:01:12.540> but<00:01:13.140> you're<00:01:13.260> going<00:01:13.380> to<00:01:13.439> see<00:01:13.619> me<00:01:13.770> use<00:01:13.979> and

00:01:14.210 --> 00:01:14.220 
well but you're going to see me use and

00:01:14.220 --> 00:01:16.520 
well but you're going to see me use and
a<00:01:14.280> huge<00:01:14.909> variety<00:01:15.180> of<00:01:15.540> weapons<00:01:15.840> here<00:01:16.259> during

00:01:16.520 --> 00:01:16.530 
a huge variety of weapons here during

00:01:16.530 --> 00:01:18.649 
a huge variety of weapons here during
this<00:01:16.680> video<00:01:16.890> and<00:01:17.460> it<00:01:17.790> pretty<00:01:18.090> definitively

00:01:18.649 --> 00:01:18.659 
this video and it pretty definitively

00:01:18.659 --> 00:01:21.740 
this video and it pretty definitively
shows<00:01:18.990> that<00:01:19.409> this<00:01:20.159> affects<00:01:20.850> the<00:01:21.150> other<00:01:21.180> guns

00:01:21.740 --> 00:01:21.750 
shows that this affects the other guns

00:01:21.750 --> 00:01:24.830 
shows that this affects the other guns
as<00:01:22.080> well<00:01:22.409> as<00:01:22.590> the<00:01:22.710> KSG<00:01:23.070> and<00:01:23.549> this<00:01:24.299> is<00:01:24.420> a<00:01:24.450> pretty

00:01:24.830 --> 00:01:24.840 
as well as the KSG and this is a pretty

00:01:24.840 --> 00:01:27.080 
as well as the KSG and this is a pretty
big<00:01:25.170> discovery<00:01:25.799> I'm<00:01:26.460> just<00:01:26.580> going<00:01:26.759> to<00:01:26.790> show<00:01:26.850> up

00:01:27.080 --> 00:01:27.090 
big discovery I'm just going to show up

00:01:27.090 --> 00:01:30.890 
big discovery I'm just going to show up
exactly<00:01:27.540> what<00:01:27.720> happens<00:01:28.170> there<00:01:28.770> is<00:01:29.040> a<00:01:29.369> bow<00:01:29.900> half

00:01:30.890 --> 00:01:30.900 
exactly what happens there is a bow half

00:01:30.900 --> 00:01:34.069 
exactly what happens there is a bow half
a<00:01:31.110> second<00:01:31.530> after<00:01:31.770> you<00:01:32.610> crouch<00:01:33.090> where<00:01:33.630> if<00:01:33.900> you

00:01:34.069 --> 00:01:34.079 
a second after you crouch where if you

00:01:34.079 --> 00:01:35.840 
a second after you crouch where if you
choose<00:01:34.409> even<00:01:34.920> if<00:01:35.040> you're<00:01:35.130> aiming<00:01:35.430> down<00:01:35.549> sighs

00:01:35.840 --> 00:01:35.850 
choose even if you're aiming down sighs

00:01:35.850 --> 00:01:38.450 
choose even if you're aiming down sighs
there<00:01:36.299> is<00:01:36.450> a<00:01:36.479> random<00:01:37.140> spread<00:01:37.619> all<00:01:38.070> your

00:01:38.450 --> 00:01:38.460 
there is a random spread all your

00:01:38.460 --> 00:01:39.859 
there is a random spread all your
bullets<00:01:38.670> aren't<00:01:39.000> going<00:01:39.210> to<00:01:39.299> go<00:01:39.450> where<00:01:39.689> you're

00:01:39.859 --> 00:01:39.869 
bullets aren't going to go where you're

correct<00:01:47.460> as<00:01:48.180> I<00:01:48.240> was<00:01:48.540> testing<00:01:48.899> this<00:01:48.990> I<00:01:49.200> noticed

00:01:49.609 --> 00:01:49.619 
correct as I was testing this I noticed

00:01:49.619 --> 00:01:51.889 
correct as I was testing this I noticed
that<00:01:49.770> when<00:01:50.009> you<00:01:50.130> crouch<00:01:50.659> your<00:01:51.659> hipfire

00:01:51.889 --> 00:01:51.899 
that when you crouch your hipfire

00:01:51.899 --> 00:01:54.590 
that when you crouch your hipfire
crosshairs<00:01:52.680> increase<00:01:53.460> before<00:01:54.180> they<00:01:54.299> go<00:01:54.420> back

00:01:54.590 --> 00:01:54.600 
crosshairs increase before they go back

00:01:54.600 --> 00:01:57.080 
crosshairs increase before they go back
to<00:01:54.630> normal<00:01:54.899> size<00:01:55.259> this<00:01:56.070> seems<00:01:56.280> to<00:01:56.490> last<00:01:56.700> for

in<00:02:18.870> you<00:02:19.019> losing<00:02:19.049> gunfights<00:02:19.920> this<00:02:20.459> seems<00:02:20.670> to

in you losing gunfights this seems to

00:02:20.819 --> 00:02:22.789

00:02:26.809 --> 00:02:26.819 
sniper Arkell seem to be the worst

00:02:26.819 --> 00:02:28.520 
sniper Arkell seem to be the worst
affected<00:02:27.450> because<00:02:27.689> they<00:02:28.019> have<00:02:28.109> such<00:02:28.290> a<00:02:28.379> wide

00:02:28.520 --> 00:02:28.530 
affected because they have such a wide

00:02:28.530 --> 00:02:30.140 
affected because they have such a wide
hipfire<00:02:28.920> spread<00:02:28.950> but<00:02:29.400> this<00:02:29.519> also<00:02:29.730> greatly

the SMGs are still affected but because

00:02:35.849 --> 00:02:37.309 
the SMGs are still affected but because

that<00:03:01.469> Trek<00:03:02.129> have<00:03:02.400> seemed<00:03:02.760> to<00:03:02.969> purposely<00:03:03.449> put

00:03:03.679 --> 00:03:03.689 
that Trek have seemed to purposely put

00:03:03.689 --> 00:03:05.659 
that Trek have seemed to purposely put
in<00:03:03.780> the<00:03:03.870> game<00:03:04.049> and<00:03:04.319> the<00:03:05.189> only<00:03:05.310> reason<00:03:05.549> I<00:03:05.609> can

00:03:05.659 --> 00:03:05.669 
in the game and the only reason I can

00:03:05.669 --> 00:03:07.159 
in the game and the only reason I can
think<00:03:05.790> that<00:03:06.120> track<00:03:06.449> would<00:03:06.659> put<00:03:06.840> this<00:03:06.959> in<00:03:07.079> the

00:03:07.159 --> 00:03:07.169 
think that track would put this in the

think that track would put this in the
game<00:03:07.349> is<00:03:07.560> to<00:03:08.189> counter<00:03:08.609> drop<00:03:08.849> shotting<00:03:09.180> now<00:03:09.389> of

00:03:09.530 --> 00:03:09.540 
game is to counter drop shotting now of

00:03:09.540 --> 00:03:11.179 
game is to counter drop shotting now of
course<00:03:09.719> drop<00:03:10.139> shotting<00:03:10.409> is<00:03:10.590> annoying<00:03:11.040> and

00:03:11.179 --> 00:03:11.189 
course drop shotting is annoying and

00:03:11.189 --> 00:03:12.830 
course drop shotting is annoying and
everything<00:03:11.579> but<00:03:12.120> I<00:03:12.180> think<00:03:12.540> they've<00:03:12.659> gone<00:03:12.780> a

00:03:12.830 --> 00:03:12.840 
everything but I think they've gone a

00:03:12.840 --> 00:03:15.170 
everything but I think they've gone a
better<00:03:13.079> completely<00:03:13.829> the<00:03:14.010> wrong<00:03:14.040> way<00:03:14.430> I<00:03:14.639> mean

00:03:15.170 --> 00:03:15.180 
better completely the wrong way I mean

00:03:15.180 --> 00:03:16.999 
better completely the wrong way I mean
the<00:03:15.269> fact<00:03:15.419> that<00:03:15.569> this<00:03:15.719> affects<00:03:16.109> sniper<00:03:16.530> rifles

00:03:16.999 --> 00:03:17.009 
the fact that this affects sniper rifles

00:03:17.009 --> 00:03:20.719 
the fact that this affects sniper rifles
in<00:03:17.189> particular<00:03:17.759> is<00:03:17.989> ridiculous<00:03:18.989> I<00:03:19.169> mean<00:03:19.729> so

00:03:20.719 --> 00:03:20.729 
in particular is ridiculous I mean so

00:03:20.729 --> 00:03:23.030 
in particular is ridiculous I mean so
many<00:03:20.879> times<00:03:21.239> I<00:03:21.449> have<00:03:21.870> been<00:03:22.139> aiming<00:03:22.379> right<00:03:22.829> at<00:03:22.889> a

00:03:23.030 --> 00:03:23.040 
many times I have been aiming right at a

00:03:23.040 --> 00:03:26.119 
many times I have been aiming right at a
guy<00:03:23.250> and<00:03:23.459> I've<00:03:24.030> shot<00:03:24.359> and<00:03:24.720> even<00:03:25.709> the<00:03:25.799> trail<00:03:26.099> of

00:03:26.119 --> 00:03:26.129 
guy and I've shot and even the trail of

00:03:26.129 --> 00:03:27.740 
guy and I've shot and even the trail of
the<00:03:26.340> bullet<00:03:26.699> looked<00:03:26.879> like<00:03:27.000> it<00:03:27.120> didn't<00:03:27.359> even<00:03:27.540> go

00:03:27.740 --> 00:03:27.750 
the bullet looked like it didn't even go

00:03:27.750 --> 00:03:31.099 
the bullet looked like it didn't even go
anywhere<00:03:28.019> near<00:03:28.590> where<00:03:29.430> I<00:03:29.489> shot<00:03:30.000> and<00:03:30.299> so<00:03:31.019> many

00:03:31.099 --> 00:03:31.109 
anywhere near where I shot and so many

00:03:31.109 --> 00:03:32.479 
anywhere near where I shot and so many
times<00:03:31.470> I've<00:03:31.680> just<00:03:31.859> kind<00:03:32.040> of<00:03:32.069> put<00:03:32.220> it<00:03:32.310> down<00:03:32.459> to

00:03:32.479 --> 00:03:32.489 
times I've just kind of put it down to

00:03:32.489 --> 00:03:35.210 
times I've just kind of put it down to
lag<00:03:32.879> or<00:03:33.180> latency<00:03:33.659> or<00:03:34.019> hit<00:03:34.560> detection<00:03:34.709> or

00:03:35.210 --> 00:03:35.220 
lag or latency or hit detection or

00:03:35.220 --> 00:03:37.759 
lag or latency or hit detection or
whatever<00:03:35.549> but<00:03:36.419> now<00:03:37.049> that<00:03:37.259> I<00:03:37.349> know<00:03:37.409> this

00:03:37.759 --> 00:03:37.769 
whatever but now that I know this

00:03:37.769 --> 00:03:39.830 
whatever but now that I know this
mechanic<00:03:38.189> is<00:03:38.310> in<00:03:38.400> the<00:03:38.489> game<00:03:38.669> it<00:03:39.449> kind<00:03:39.750> of

00:03:39.830 --> 00:03:39.840 
mechanic is in the game it kind of

00:03:39.840 --> 00:03:42.499 
mechanic is in the game it kind of
pisses<00:03:40.079> me<00:03:40.349> off<00:03:40.430> the<00:03:41.430> only<00:03:41.790> real<00:03:41.970> advice<00:03:42.269> I<00:03:42.449> can

00:03:42.499 --> 00:03:42.509 
pisses me off the only real advice I can

00:03:42.509 --> 00:03:45.259 
pisses me off the only real advice I can
give<00:03:42.629> you<00:03:42.989> is<00:03:43.019> that<00:03:43.590> the<00:03:44.159> laser<00:03:44.400> sight<00:03:44.729> should

00:03:45.259 --> 00:03:45.269 
give you is that the laser sight should

00:03:45.269 --> 00:03:47.449 
give you is that the laser sight should
in<00:03:45.540> theory<00:03:46.169> assuming<00:03:46.829> my<00:03:46.949> theory<00:03:47.310> is<00:03:47.400> correct

00:03:47.449 --> 00:03:47.459 
in theory assuming my theory is correct

00:03:47.459 --> 00:03:49.099 
in theory assuming my theory is correct
and<00:03:47.819> it<00:03:47.970> has<00:03:48.090> to<00:03:48.120> do<00:03:48.359> with<00:03:48.540> this<00:03:48.659> hip<00:03:48.870> fire

00:03:49.099 --> 00:03:49.109 
and it has to do with this hip fire

00:03:49.109 --> 00:03:51.319 
and it has to do with this hip fire
spread<00:03:49.139> it<00:03:49.680> should<00:03:50.280> tighten<00:03:50.609> up<00:03:50.819> the<00:03:51.000> spread

00:03:51.319 --> 00:03:51.329 
spread it should tighten up the spread

00:03:51.329 --> 00:03:52.879 
spread it should tighten up the spread
so<00:03:51.629> much<00:03:51.840> they're<00:03:52.109> still<00:03:52.349> going<00:03:52.500> to<00:03:52.590> be<00:03:52.680> that

00:03:52.879 --> 00:03:52.889 
so much they're still going to be that

00:03:52.889 --> 00:03:54.349 
so much they're still going to be that
random<00:03:53.220> spread<00:03:53.519> but<00:03:53.729> it<00:03:53.819> shouldn't<00:03:54.090> be<00:03:54.120> as

00:03:54.349 --> 00:03:54.359 
random spread but it shouldn't be as

00:03:54.359 --> 00:03:56.539 
random spread but it shouldn't be as
severe<00:03:54.900> but<00:03:55.500> it's<00:03:55.650> not<00:03:55.829> still<00:03:56.219> not<00:03:56.370> going<00:03:56.489> to

00:03:56.539 --> 00:03:56.549 
severe but it's not still not going to

00:03:56.549 --> 00:03:57.709 
severe but it's not still not going to
make<00:03:56.639> that<00:03:56.699> much<00:03:56.969> of<00:03:57.060> a<00:03:57.150> difference<00:03:57.180> i<00:03:57.599> mean

00:03:57.709 --> 00:03:57.719 
make that much of a difference i mean

00:03:57.719 --> 00:03:59.959 
make that much of a difference i mean
the<00:03:57.810> biggest<00:03:58.169> thing<00:03:58.379> that<00:03:58.409> you<00:03:58.680> can<00:03:58.859> do<00:03:59.040> is<00:03:59.250> to

00:03:59.959 --> 00:03:59.969 
the biggest thing that you can do is to

00:03:59.969 --> 00:04:02.059 
the biggest thing that you can do is to
be<00:04:00.000> consciously<00:04:00.989> aware<00:04:01.079> that<00:04:01.560> this<00:04:01.620> mechanic

00:04:02.059 --> 00:04:02.069 
be consciously aware that this mechanic

00:04:02.069 --> 00:04:05.030 
be consciously aware that this mechanic
is<00:04:02.189> in<00:04:02.280> the<00:04:02.370> game<00:04:02.519> and<00:04:02.790> not<00:04:03.599> if<00:04:04.139> you<00:04:04.349> crouch<00:04:04.680> or

00:04:05.030 --> 00:04:05.040 
is in the game and not if you crouch or

00:04:05.040 --> 00:04:06.649 
is in the game and not if you crouch or
prone<00:04:05.400> while<00:04:05.699> you're<00:04:05.819> shooting<00:04:06.060> your<00:04:06.329> bullets

00:04:06.649 --> 00:04:06.659 
prone while you're shooting your bullets

00:04:06.659 --> 00:04:07.999 
prone while you're shooting your bullets
aren't<00:04:06.870> going<00:04:07.079> to<00:04:07.139> go<00:04:07.259> where<00:04:07.590> you're<00:04:07.799> aiming

00:04:07.999 --> 00:04:08.009 
aren't going to go where you're aiming

00:04:08.009 --> 00:04:10.640 
aren't going to go where you're aiming
so<00:04:08.669> you<00:04:08.729> need<00:04:09.269> to<00:04:09.299> be<00:04:09.419> aware<00:04:09.599> of<00:04:09.780> that<00:04:10.079> and<00:04:10.319> just

00:04:10.640 --> 00:04:10.650 
so you need to be aware of that and just

00:04:10.650 --> 00:04:12.770 
so you need to be aware of that and just
make<00:04:11.009> a<00:04:11.039> conscious<00:04:11.310> effort<00:04:11.549> to<00:04:11.759> not<00:04:11.879> Crouch<00:04:12.509> or

00:04:12.770 --> 00:04:12.780 
make a conscious effort to not Crouch or

00:04:12.780 --> 00:04:14.929 
make a conscious effort to not Crouch or
prone<00:04:13.049> while<00:04:13.379> shooting<00:04:13.829> I<00:04:14.129> don't<00:04:14.759> generally

00:04:14.929 --> 00:04:14.939 
prone while shooting I don't generally

00:04:14.939 --> 00:04:16.819 
prone while shooting I don't generally
tend<00:04:15.329> to<00:04:15.449> look<00:04:15.599> for<00:04:15.870> lycra<00:04:16.169> favorites<00:04:16.590> but<00:04:16.769> the

00:04:16.819 --> 00:04:16.829 
tend to look for lycra favorites but the

00:04:16.829 --> 00:04:18.259 
tend to look for lycra favorites but the
fact<00:04:17.039> that<00:04:17.159> I<00:04:17.430> haven't<00:04:17.699> seen<00:04:17.940> any<00:04:18.180> other

00:04:18.259 --> 00:04:18.269 
fact that I haven't seen any other

00:04:18.269 --> 00:04:20.390 
fact that I haven't seen any other
videos<00:04:18.780> outlining<00:04:19.380> this<00:04:19.709> in<00:04:19.979> accuracy

00:04:20.390 --> 00:04:20.400 
videos outlining this in accuracy

00:04:20.400 --> 00:04:22.430 
videos outlining this in accuracy
problem<00:04:20.880> really<00:04:21.479> does<00:04:21.630> show<00:04:21.840> that<00:04:21.870> not<00:04:22.349> a<00:04:22.380> lot

00:04:22.430 --> 00:04:22.440 
problem really does show that not a lot

00:04:22.440 --> 00:04:24.740 
problem really does show that not a lot
of<00:04:22.560> people<00:04:22.650> know<00:04:22.889> about<00:04:23.190> this<00:04:23.460> so<00:04:23.969> if<00:04:24.180> you<00:04:24.330> if

00:04:24.740 --> 00:04:24.750 
of people know about this so if you if

00:04:24.750 --> 00:04:26.300 
of people know about this so if you if
you<00:04:25.050> were<00:04:25.199> to<00:04:25.409> give<00:04:25.529> me<00:04:25.560> a<00:04:25.650> like<00:04:25.800> a<00:04:25.830> favorite

00:04:26.300 --> 00:04:26.310 
you were to give me a like a favorite

00:04:26.310 --> 00:04:27.950

or if you were to share this video that

00:04:27.960 --> 00:04:29.690 
or if you were to share this video that
would<00:04:28.139> be<00:04:28.260> awesome<00:04:28.500> I<00:04:29.040> want<00:04:29.250> as<00:04:29.430> many<00:04:29.580> people

would be awesome I want as many people
to<00:04:29.970> know<00:04:30.389> about<00:04:30.540> this<00:04:30.750> we<00:04:31.110> could<00:04:31.260> even<00:04:31.410> bring

00:04:31.640 --> 00:04:31.650 
to know about this we could even bring

00:04:31.650 --> 00:04:32.629 
to know about this we could even bring
it<00:04:31.710> to<00:04:31.889> the<00:04:31.980> attention<00:04:32.010> of<00:04:32.400> what<00:04:32.550> our

00:04:32.629 --> 00:04:32.639 
it to the attention of what our

00:04:32.639 --> 00:04:33.980 
it to the attention of what our
commentators<00:04:33.240> so<00:04:33.360> that<00:04:33.480> they<00:04:33.660> can<00:04:33.840> make

00:04:33.980 --> 00:04:33.990 
commentators so that they can make

00:04:33.990 --> 00:04:36.050 
commentators so that they can make
videos<00:04:34.139> about<00:04:34.320> this<00:04:34.740> as<00:04:34.919> well<00:04:35.130> and<00:04:35.430> they<00:04:35.850> can

00:04:36.050 --> 00:04:36.060 
videos about this as well and they can

00:04:36.060 --> 00:04:37.580 
videos about this as well and they can
inform<00:04:36.419> their<00:04:36.630> subscribers<00:04:37.230> and<00:04:37.320> everything

00:04:37.580 --> 00:04:37.590 
inform their subscribers and everything

00:04:37.590 --> 00:04:38.870 
inform their subscribers and everything
and<00:04:37.650> we<00:04:37.740> can<00:04:37.860> really<00:04:38.040> get<00:04:38.250> that<00:04:38.430> message<00:04:38.639> out

00:04:38.870 --> 00:04:38.880 
and we can really get that message out

00:04:38.880 --> 00:04:41.150 
and we can really get that message out
there<00:04:38.940> that<00:04:39.570> would<00:04:39.690> be<00:04:39.720> great<00:04:40.110> and<00:04:40.380> hopefully

00:04:41.150 --> 00:04:41.160 
there that would be great and hopefully

00:04:41.160 --> 00:04:43.310 
there that would be great and hopefully
if<00:04:41.610> we<00:04:41.910> all<00:04:42.150> band<00:04:42.180> together<00:04:42.540> we<00:04:42.840> can<00:04:42.960> get<00:04:43.050> traer

00:04:43.310 --> 00:04:43.320 
if we all band together we can get traer

00:04:43.320 --> 00:04:45.710 
if we all band together we can get traer
to<00:04:43.590> remove<00:04:44.010> this<00:04:44.220> because<00:04:44.669> quite<00:04:45.240> frankly<00:04:45.300> I

00:04:45.710 --> 00:04:45.720 
to remove this because quite frankly I

00:04:45.720 --> 00:04:47.540 
to remove this because quite frankly I
don't<00:04:45.780> feel<00:04:46.169> it's<00:04:46.590> the<00:04:46.919> right<00:04:46.950> way<00:04:47.370> to<00:04:47.430> go

00:04:47.540 --> 00:04:47.550 
don't feel it's the right way to go
