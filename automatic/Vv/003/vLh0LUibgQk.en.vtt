00:00:08.900 --> 00:00:08.910 
all right so we've got to do a hard

00:00:08.910 --> 00:00:13.039 
all right so we've got to do a hard
drive<00:00:09.150> replacement<00:00:09.299> on<00:00:10.250> a<00:00:11.539> latitude<00:00:12.539> I<00:00:12.869> think

00:00:13.039 --> 00:00:13.049 
drive replacement on a latitude I think

00:00:13.049 --> 00:00:18.410 
drive replacement on a latitude I think
this<00:00:13.139> is<00:00:13.289> a<00:00:13.520> 6400<00:00:15.650> East<00:00:16.650> 6400<00:00:17.490> bill<00:00:17.940> attitude

00:00:18.410 --> 00:00:18.420 
this is a 6400 East 6400 bill attitude

00:00:18.420 --> 00:00:24.140 
this is a 6400 East 6400 bill attitude
II<00:00:18.540> 6400<00:00:20.060> very<00:00:21.060> easy<00:00:22.490> it's<00:00:23.490> got<00:00:23.670> two<00:00:23.940> little

00:00:24.140 --> 00:00:24.150 
II 6400 very easy it's got two little

00:00:24.150 --> 00:00:35.130 
II 6400 very easy it's got two little
holes<00:00:24.480> in<00:00:25.370> this<00:00:26.370> back<00:00:27.270> cover<00:00:27.660> right<00:00:27.840> here

00:00:35.130 --> 00:00:35.140 

00:00:35.140 --> 00:00:40.850 

pick<00:00:35.950> those<00:00:36.130> two<00:00:36.190> screws<00:00:36.670> out<00:00:38.340> and<00:00:39.340> right<00:00:39.610> here

00:00:40.850 --> 00:00:40.860 
pick those two screws out and right here

00:00:40.860 --> 00:00:43.440 
pick those two screws out and right here
this<00:00:41.860> is<00:00:42.040> on<00:00:42.160> the<00:00:42.250> same<00:00:42.430> side<00:00:42.490> as<00:00:43.000> the<00:00:43.030> VGA

00:00:43.440 --> 00:00:43.450 
this is on the same side as the VGA

00:00:43.450 --> 00:00:45.570 
this is on the same side as the VGA
connection<00:00:44.130> there's<00:00:45.130> like<00:00:45.250> a<00:00:45.280> little<00:00:45.460> part

00:00:45.570 --> 00:00:45.580 
connection there's like a little part

00:00:45.580 --> 00:00:47.940 
connection there's like a little part
you<00:00:45.850> can<00:00:45.970> grab<00:00:46.180> it<00:00:46.210> and<00:00:46.570> our<00:00:47.380> drive<00:00:47.680> just

00:00:47.940 --> 00:00:47.950 
you can grab it and our drive just

00:00:47.950 --> 00:00:52.260 
you can grab it and our drive just
slides<00:00:48.220> out<00:00:48.840> so<00:00:49.840> there's<00:00:50.020> the<00:00:50.260> drive<00:00:51.059> it's<00:00:52.059> got

00:00:52.260 --> 00:00:52.270 
slides out so there's the drive it's got

00:00:52.270 --> 00:01:04.270 
slides out so there's the drive it's got
a<00:00:52.300> screw<00:00:52.750> on<00:00:53.050> this<00:00:53.739> side

00:01:04.270 --> 00:01:04.280 

00:01:04.280 --> 00:01:12.030 

take<00:01:04.460> that<00:01:04.640> screw<00:01:04.970> out

00:01:12.030 --> 00:01:12.040 

00:01:12.040 --> 00:01:20.060 

take<00:01:12.640> our<00:01:12.790> new<00:01:12.820> drive

00:01:20.060 --> 00:01:20.070 

00:01:20.070 --> 00:01:22.700 

it's<00:01:20.430> got<00:01:20.580> a<00:01:20.610> little<00:01:20.900> peg<00:01:21.900> or<00:01:22.260> something<00:01:22.590> that

00:01:22.700 --> 00:01:22.710 
it's got a little peg or something that

00:01:22.710 --> 00:01:31.050 
it's got a little peg or something that
goes<00:01:22.830> in<00:01:23.040> this<00:01:23.630> bottom<00:01:24.630> hole

00:01:31.050 --> 00:01:31.060 

00:01:31.060 --> 00:01:44.020 

screw

00:01:44.020 --> 00:01:44.030 

00:01:44.030 --> 00:01:47.830 

with<00:01:44.630> this<00:01:45.050> part<00:01:45.470> of<00:01:45.650> the<00:01:45.770> cover<00:01:46.750> towards<00:01:47.750> the

00:01:47.830 --> 00:01:47.840 
with this part of the cover towards the

00:01:47.840 --> 00:01:49.210 
with this part of the cover towards the
bottom<00:01:47.990> of<00:01:48.170> the<00:01:48.230> drive<00:01:48.440> a<00:01:48.710> little<00:01:48.830> part<00:01:49.190> that

00:01:49.210 --> 00:01:49.220 
bottom of the drive a little part that

00:01:49.220 --> 00:01:50.590 
bottom of the drive a little part that
you<00:01:49.370> grab<00:01:49.550> goes<00:01:49.820> towards<00:01:50.090> the<00:01:50.150> bottom<00:01:50.270> because

00:01:50.590 --> 00:01:50.600 
you grab goes towards the bottom because

00:01:50.600 --> 00:01:53.250 
you grab goes towards the bottom because
the<00:01:50.690> screw<00:01:50.930> hole<00:01:51.110> is<00:01:51.230> going<00:01:51.350> to<00:01:51.410> face<00:01:51.620> that<00:01:51.920> way

00:01:53.250 --> 00:01:53.260 
the screw hole is going to face that way

00:01:53.260 --> 00:02:08.050 
the screw hole is going to face that way
we<00:01:54.260> just<00:01:55.360> slip<00:01:56.360> it<00:01:56.450> back<00:01:56.630> in

00:02:08.050 --> 00:02:08.060 

00:02:08.060 --> 00:02:10.749 

we'll<00:02:08.570> also<00:02:08.660> cover<00:02:09.110> memory<00:02:10.100> upgrade<00:02:10.460> in<00:02:10.610> this

00:02:10.749 --> 00:02:10.759 
we'll also cover memory upgrade in this

00:02:10.759 --> 00:02:11.440 
we'll also cover memory upgrade in this
mode<00:02:10.970> as<00:02:11.090> well

00:02:11.440 --> 00:02:11.450 
mode as well

00:02:11.450 --> 00:02:13.210 
mode as well
so<00:02:12.110> if<00:02:12.170> you<00:02:12.230> want<00:02:12.380> to<00:02:12.410> do<00:02:12.500> a<00:02:12.530> memory<00:02:12.710> upgrade

00:02:13.210 --> 00:02:13.220 
so if you want to do a memory upgrade

00:02:13.220 --> 00:02:17.140 
so if you want to do a memory upgrade
there's<00:02:14.000> a<00:02:14.060> little<00:02:14.330> center<00:02:15.670> screw<00:02:16.670> right<00:02:16.880> here

00:02:17.140 --> 00:02:17.150 
there's a little center screw right here

00:02:17.150 --> 00:02:20.470 
there's a little center screw right here
it's<00:02:17.750> actually<00:02:17.870> spring<00:02:18.380> loaded<00:02:19.060> back<00:02:20.060> it<00:02:20.270> off

00:02:20.470 --> 00:02:20.480 
it's actually spring loaded back it off

00:02:20.480 --> 00:02:23.260 
it's actually spring loaded back it off
it<00:02:21.440> pops<00:02:21.770> itself<00:02:22.160> up<00:02:22.370> a<00:02:22.400> little<00:02:22.730> screw<00:02:23.000> under

00:02:23.260 --> 00:02:23.270 
it pops itself up a little screw under

00:02:23.270 --> 00:02:30.070 
it pops itself up a little screw under
it<00:02:25.720> slide<00:02:26.720> this<00:02:26.750> cover<00:02:27.350> back<00:02:27.830> and<00:02:28.190> up<00:02:28.790> and<00:02:29.080> the

00:02:34.140 --> 00:02:34.150 
bottom covers off you got your two

00:02:34.150 --> 00:02:39.340 
bottom covers off you got your two
sticks<00:02:35.150> of<00:02:35.390> ddr2<00:02:36.760> pop<00:02:37.760> the<00:02:37.970> little<00:02:38.180> little<00:02:39.170> two

00:02:51.880 --> 00:02:51.890 
same thing for the bottom one pull them

00:02:51.890 --> 00:02:55.960 
same thing for the bottom one pull them
out<00:02:52.070> so<00:02:52.570> we<00:02:53.570> get<00:02:53.660> the<00:02:53.750> RAM<00:02:53.930> mount<00:02:54.250> and<00:02:55.250> we<00:02:55.520> put

00:02:55.960 --> 00:02:55.970 
out so we get the RAM mount and we put

00:02:55.970 --> 00:03:01.059 
out so we get the RAM mount and we put
the<00:02:56.090> RAM<00:02:56.590> new<00:02:57.590> RAM<00:02:58.240> back<00:02:59.240> in

00:03:01.059 --> 00:03:01.069 
the RAM new RAM back in

00:03:01.069 --> 00:03:02.920 
the RAM new RAM back in
I'm<00:03:01.640> just<00:03:01.849> putting<00:03:02.030> the<00:03:02.090> same<00:03:02.299> remnant<00:03:02.810> I'm

00:03:02.920 --> 00:03:02.930 
I'm just putting the same remnant I'm

00:03:02.930 --> 00:03:04.300 
I'm just putting the same remnant I'm
not<00:03:03.049> upgrading<00:03:03.499> the<00:03:03.560> RAM<00:03:03.590> of<00:03:03.739> this<00:03:03.980> and<00:03:04.129> I<00:03:04.159> just

00:03:04.300 --> 00:03:04.310 
not upgrading the RAM of this and I just

00:03:04.310 --> 00:03:10.149 
not upgrading the RAM of this and I just
figured<00:03:04.459> I'd<00:03:04.640> shadow<00:03:04.879> do<00:03:05.120> it<00:03:08.980> should<00:03:09.980> back

00:03:10.149 --> 00:03:10.159 
figured I'd shadow do it should back

00:03:10.159 --> 00:03:13.179 
figured I'd shadow do it should back
down<00:03:10.719> make<00:03:11.719> sure<00:03:11.989> they're<00:03:12.469> both<00:03:12.620> seated<00:03:13.010> in

00:03:13.179 --> 00:03:13.189 
down make sure they're both seated in

00:03:13.189 --> 00:03:17.530 
down make sure they're both seated in
place<00:03:15.430> another<00:03:16.430> good<00:03:16.730> thing<00:03:16.760> to<00:03:17.030> do<00:03:17.180> while<00:03:17.420> you
