00:00:01.939 --> 00:00:06.290
 today we are going to make rice noodles 

00:00:03.830 --> 00:00:09.520
 with Chinese style chicken and we're going to 

00:00:06.290 --> 00:00:09.520
 use these ingredients 

00:00:10.380 --> 00:00:18.029
 rice noodles a chicken breast 

00:00:13.260 --> 00:00:20.460
 filleted an onion a carrot a 

00:00:18.029 --> 00:00:23.580
 Italian green pepper a zucchini 

00:00:20.460 --> 00:00:26.450
 medium soy sauce and olive oil 

00:00:23.580 --> 00:00:26.450
 extra virgin 

00:00:26.830 --> 00:00:32.009
 we started by washing all the 

00:00:28.570 --> 00:00:34.469
 vegetables and peel the carrot 

00:00:32.009 --> 00:00:37.370
 we cut the carrot the pepper and the 

00:00:34.469 --> 00:00:37.370
 sliced onion 

00:00:40.840 --> 00:00:44.800
 the zucchini is divided into four 

00:00:42.850 --> 00:00:46.510
 parts in the long run and we also do 

00:00:44.800 --> 00:00:48.960
 slices less than one centimeter 

00:00:46.510 --> 00:00:48.960
 thickness 

00:00:50.500 --> 00:00:55.870
 once they are all cut we throw a 

00:00:53.350 --> 00:00:57.820
 squirt oil in a pan or wok and 

00:00:55.870 --> 00:00:59.530
 when it's hot we add all the 

00:00:57.820 --> 00:01:01.510
 vegetables 

00:00:59.530 --> 00:01:04.800
 We fry and wait for them to alight 

00:01:01.510 --> 00:01:04.800
 Stirring occasionally 

00:01:04.960 --> 00:01:10.830
 meanwhile we cut the chicken in 

00:01:06.970 --> 00:01:10.830
 pieces of approximately 2 centimeters 

00:01:14.490 --> 00:01:18.240
 we put to heat water with salt and in the 

00:01:16.829 --> 00:01:20.600
 moment that it starts to boil we add 

00:01:18.240 --> 00:01:22.400
 half of the noodle bag 

00:01:20.600 --> 00:01:26.090
 and we cook them during the time 

00:01:22.400 --> 00:01:29.350
 put the package we drain them cut 

00:01:26.090 --> 00:01:31.689
 the cooking with cold water and we reserve it 

00:01:29.350 --> 00:01:33.130
 this rice pasta the find in 

00:01:31.689 --> 00:01:35.820
 the international cuisine section of 

00:01:33.130 --> 00:01:37.740
 any supermarket 

00:01:35.820 --> 00:01:40.560
 when we see that the vegetables are 

00:01:37.740 --> 00:01:43.550
 poached we add the pieces of chicken and 

00:01:40.560 --> 00:01:43.550
 we cook until it 's 

00:01:48.970 --> 00:01:55.740
 when the chicken is ready we incorporate 

00:01:51.520 --> 00:01:55.740
 the noodles and we stir a little 

00:02:02.490 --> 00:02:06.010
 finally pour a splash of sauce 

00:02:04.770 --> 00:02:07.870
 soy 

00:02:06.010 --> 00:02:10.110
 the quantity depends on the taste of each 

00:02:07.870 --> 00:02:10.110
 one 

00:02:12.330 --> 00:02:16.910
 we remove and they are ready to 

00:02:14.520 --> 00:02:16.910
 to serve 

00:02:16.980 --> 00:02:21.180
 It is a very easy recipe to make and 

00:02:19.890 --> 00:02:23.240
 flavor is very similar to that of 

00:02:21.180 --> 00:02:26.290
 chinese restaurants 

00:02:23.240 --> 00:02:26.290
 I hope you like it
