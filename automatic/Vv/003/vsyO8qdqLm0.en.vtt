00:00:01.579 --> 00:00:01.589 
hello everyone this is jeff of

00:00:01.589 --> 00:00:03.830 
hello everyone this is jeff of
taofledermaus<00:00:01.909> and<00:00:02.909> today<00:00:03.419> we're<00:00:03.540> gonna<00:00:03.600> be

00:00:03.830 --> 00:00:03.840 
taofledermaus and today we're gonna be

00:00:03.840 --> 00:00:06.800 
taofledermaus and today we're gonna be
shooting<00:00:04.049> Oobleck<00:00:04.710> bullets<00:00:05.540> and<00:00:06.540> of<00:00:06.600> course

00:00:06.800 --> 00:00:06.810 
shooting Oobleck bullets and of course

00:00:06.810 --> 00:00:09.259 
shooting Oobleck bullets and of course
Oobleck<00:00:07.170> is<00:00:07.350> just<00:00:07.589> cornstarch<00:00:08.280> and<00:00:08.550> water<00:00:08.639> and

00:00:09.259 --> 00:00:09.269 
Oobleck is just cornstarch and water and

00:00:09.269 --> 00:00:12.589 
Oobleck is just cornstarch and water and
is<00:00:09.809> a<00:00:09.840> non-newtonian<00:00:10.800> fluid<00:00:11.460> and<00:00:11.759> what<00:00:12.330> makes

00:00:12.589 --> 00:00:12.599 
is a non-newtonian fluid and what makes

00:00:12.599 --> 00:00:15.230 
is a non-newtonian fluid and what makes
this<00:00:12.809> substance<00:00:13.650> so<00:00:13.830> unusual<00:00:14.460> is<00:00:14.670> that<00:00:14.730> it's

00:00:15.230 --> 00:00:15.240 
this substance so unusual is that it's

00:00:15.240 --> 00:00:17.950 
this substance so unusual is that it's
it's<00:00:15.990> considered<00:00:16.560> a<00:00:16.680> shear<00:00:17.310> thickening

00:00:17.950 --> 00:00:17.960 
it's considered a shear thickening

00:00:17.960 --> 00:00:20.510 
it's considered a shear thickening
non-newtonian<00:00:18.960> fluid<00:00:19.470> meaning<00:00:19.770> when<00:00:20.250> you<00:00:20.279> put

00:00:20.510 --> 00:00:20.520 
non-newtonian fluid meaning when you put

00:00:20.520 --> 00:00:23.259 
non-newtonian fluid meaning when you put
it<00:00:20.640> under<00:00:20.820> stress<00:00:21.180> it<00:00:21.539> actually<00:00:22.320> becomes

00:00:23.259 --> 00:00:23.269 
it under stress it actually becomes

00:00:23.269 --> 00:00:26.779 
it under stress it actually becomes
stiffer<00:00:24.269> it<00:00:24.390> becomes<00:00:24.689> like<00:00:24.869> solid<00:00:25.740> so<00:00:26.550> when<00:00:26.699> we

00:00:26.779 --> 00:00:26.789 
stiffer it becomes like solid so when we

00:00:26.789 --> 00:00:28.640 
stiffer it becomes like solid so when we
filled<00:00:27.060> a<00:00:27.150> balloon<00:00:27.510> with<00:00:27.779> this<00:00:28.019> it<00:00:28.260> definitely

00:00:28.640 --> 00:00:28.650 
filled a balloon with this it definitely

00:00:28.650 --> 00:00:30.999 
filled a balloon with this it definitely
behaved<00:00:29.279> completely<00:00:30.060> different<00:00:30.420> than<00:00:30.630> water

00:00:30.999 --> 00:00:31.009 
behaved completely different than water

00:00:31.009 --> 00:00:35.330 
behaved completely different than water
in<00:00:32.329> this<00:00:33.329> experiment<00:00:34.110> we<00:00:34.320> shot<00:00:34.770> a<00:00:34.980> balloon

00:00:35.330 --> 00:00:35.340 
in this experiment we shot a balloon

00:00:35.340 --> 00:00:38.240 
in this experiment we shot a balloon
full<00:00:35.640> of<00:00:35.700> who<00:00:35.910> blocked<00:00:36.239> with<00:00:36.450> a<00:00:36.480> gun<00:00:36.750> and<00:00:37.250> it

00:00:38.240 --> 00:00:38.250 
full of who blocked with a gun and it

00:00:38.250 --> 00:00:40.479 
full of who blocked with a gun and it
acted<00:00:38.579> exactly<00:00:38.760> like<00:00:39.329> a<00:00:39.360> shear<00:00:39.960> thickening

00:00:40.479 --> 00:00:40.489 
acted exactly like a shear thickening

00:00:40.489 --> 00:00:50.520 
acted exactly like a shear thickening
non-newtonian<00:00:41.489> fluid<00:00:42.360> should<00:00:42.719> act

00:00:50.520 --> 00:00:50.530 

00:00:50.530 --> 00:00:52.890 

so<00:00:51.130> we<00:00:51.250> thought<00:00:51.490> okay<00:00:51.940> let's<00:00:51.970> fill<00:00:52.330> a<00:00:52.360> shotgun

00:00:52.890 --> 00:00:52.900 
so we thought okay let's fill a shotgun

00:00:52.900 --> 00:00:55.740 
so we thought okay let's fill a shotgun
shell<00:00:53.410> with<00:00:53.740> this<00:00:54.130> Oobleck<00:00:54.670> and<00:00:54.910> shoot<00:00:55.480> it<00:00:55.630> and

00:00:55.740 --> 00:00:55.750 
shell with this Oobleck and shoot it and

00:00:55.750 --> 00:01:01.980 
shell with this Oobleck and shoot it and
see<00:00:55.840> what<00:00:56.170> happens

00:01:01.980 --> 00:01:01.990 

00:01:01.990 --> 00:01:04.660 

in<00:01:02.990> this<00:01:03.440> situation<00:01:04.040> it<00:01:04.190> didn't<00:01:04.400> have<00:01:04.520> the

00:01:04.660 --> 00:01:04.670 
in this situation it didn't have the

00:01:04.670 --> 00:01:08.920 
in this situation it didn't have the
cohesive<00:01:05.480> strength<00:01:05.780> to<00:01:06.110> stay<00:01:06.860> together<00:01:07.930> in

00:01:08.920 --> 00:01:08.930 
cohesive strength to stay together in

00:01:08.930 --> 00:01:12.070 
cohesive strength to stay together in
another<00:01:09.080> experiment<00:01:09.680> we<00:01:10.010> shot<00:01:10.420> liquids<00:01:11.420> in<00:01:11.690> a

00:01:12.070 --> 00:01:12.080 
another experiment we shot liquids in a

00:01:12.080 --> 00:01:14.850 
another experiment we shot liquids in a
capsule<00:01:12.380> out<00:01:12.890> of<00:01:13.130> a<00:01:13.190> shotgun

00:01:14.850 --> 00:01:14.860 
capsule out of a shotgun

00:01:14.860 --> 00:01:18.730 
capsule out of a shotgun
now<00:01:15.860> liquids<00:01:16.280> cannot<00:01:16.640> compress<00:01:17.270> so<00:01:18.230> the<00:01:18.410> shock

00:01:18.730 --> 00:01:18.740 
now liquids cannot compress so the shock

00:01:18.740 --> 00:01:21.280 
now liquids cannot compress so the shock
wave<00:01:19.010> from<00:01:19.040> the<00:01:19.430> gun<00:01:19.930> accelerated<00:01:20.930> the<00:01:21.050> water

00:01:21.280 --> 00:01:21.290 
wave from the gun accelerated the water

00:01:21.290 --> 00:01:23.710 
wave from the gun accelerated the water
faster<00:01:22.220> than<00:01:22.250> the<00:01:22.640> capsule<00:01:23.390> could<00:01:23.600> be

00:01:23.710 --> 00:01:23.720 
faster than the capsule could be

00:01:23.720 --> 00:01:25.690 
faster than the capsule could be
accelerated<00:01:24.380> so<00:01:24.500> it<00:01:24.620> blew<00:01:24.800> out<00:01:24.860> and<00:01:25.340> we've

00:01:25.690 --> 00:01:25.700 
accelerated so it blew out and we've

00:01:25.700 --> 00:01:27.700 
accelerated so it blew out and we've
seen<00:01:26.000> the<00:01:26.150> same<00:01:26.420> exact<00:01:26.870> thing<00:01:27.110> in<00:01:27.350> another

00:01:27.700 --> 00:01:27.710 
seen the same exact thing in another

00:01:27.710 --> 00:01:34.540 
seen the same exact thing in another
experiment<00:01:28.370> using<00:01:29.000> a<00:01:29.210> paintball<00:01:33.370> so<00:01:34.370> if<00:01:34.430> we

00:01:34.540 --> 00:01:34.550 
experiment using a paintball so if we

00:01:34.550 --> 00:01:37.450 
experiment using a paintball so if we
put<00:01:34.760> a<00:01:34.970> block<00:01:35.210> inside<00:01:35.390> a<00:01:35.600> capsule<00:01:35.870> will<00:01:36.830> it<00:01:37.160> be

00:01:37.450 --> 00:01:37.460 
put a block inside a capsule will it be

00:01:37.460 --> 00:01:44.080 
put a block inside a capsule will it be
able<00:01:37.610> to<00:01:37.790> withstand<00:01:38.390> the<00:01:39.020> shock<00:01:39.260> wave<00:01:43.090> our

00:01:44.080 --> 00:01:44.090 
able to withstand the shock wave our

00:01:44.090 --> 00:01:46.420 
able to withstand the shock wave our
first<00:01:44.360> experiment<00:01:45.020> will<00:01:45.140> use<00:01:45.380> a<00:01:45.619> capsule<00:01:46.220> full

00:01:46.420 --> 00:01:46.430 
first experiment will use a capsule full

00:01:46.430 --> 00:01:51.010 
first experiment will use a capsule full
of<00:01:46.550> liquid<00:01:47.030> red<00:01:47.630> dye<00:01:47.930> I<00:01:49.780> have<00:01:50.780> to<00:01:50.840> put<00:01:50.990> a

00:01:51.010 --> 00:01:51.020 
of liquid red dye I have to put a

00:01:51.020 --> 00:01:52.930 
of liquid red dye I have to put a
sweater<00:01:51.290> on<00:01:51.440> here<00:01:51.770> pretty<00:01:51.950> soon<00:01:52.040> as<00:01:52.400> it<00:01:52.729> goes

00:01:52.930 --> 00:01:52.940 
sweater on here pretty soon as it goes

00:01:52.940 --> 00:01:55.570 
sweater on here pretty soon as it goes
from<00:01:53.000> hot<00:01:53.240> to<00:01:53.450> cold<00:01:53.479> yeah<00:01:54.229> it's<00:01:54.440> almost<00:01:54.590> 70<00:01:55.550> I

00:01:55.570 --> 00:01:55.580 
from hot to cold yeah it's almost 70 I

00:01:55.580 --> 00:02:02.770 
from hot to cold yeah it's almost 70 I
think<00:01:55.880> oh<00:02:01.030> that's<00:02:02.030> so<00:02:02.240> cool

00:02:02.770 --> 00:02:02.780 
think oh that's so cool

00:02:02.780 --> 00:02:04.300 
think oh that's so cool
and<00:02:02.990> of<00:02:03.110> course<00:02:03.290> this<00:02:03.440> normal<00:02:03.770> liquid<00:02:03.950> behaves

00:02:04.300 --> 00:02:04.310 
and of course this normal liquid behaves

00:02:04.310 --> 00:02:06.219 
and of course this normal liquid behaves
exactly<00:02:04.670> like<00:02:05.000> we<00:02:05.300> thought<00:02:05.660> it<00:02:05.720> would

00:02:06.219 --> 00:02:06.229 
exactly like we thought it would

00:02:06.229 --> 00:02:08.680 
exactly like we thought it would
blowing<00:02:06.920> out<00:02:07.039> the<00:02:07.250> capsule<00:02:07.759> and<00:02:07.940> creating<00:02:08.600> a

00:02:08.680 --> 00:02:08.690 
blowing out the capsule and creating a

00:02:08.690 --> 00:02:10.570 
blowing out the capsule and creating a
really<00:02:08.929> cool-looking<00:02:09.200> red<00:02:10.039> mist

00:02:10.570 --> 00:02:10.580 
really cool-looking red mist

00:02:10.580 --> 00:02:15.190 
really cool-looking red mist
we<00:02:11.510> guys<00:02:11.690> catch<00:02:12.050> up<00:02:12.080> and<00:02:13.330> it's<00:02:14.330> pulled<00:02:15.050> out

00:02:15.190 --> 00:02:15.200 
we guys catch up and it's pulled out

00:02:15.200 --> 00:02:18.510 
we guys catch up and it's pulled out
there<00:02:15.500> you<00:02:15.590> go<00:02:15.680> it's<00:02:16.640> ketchup<00:02:17.170> which<00:02:18.170> is<00:02:18.320> a

00:02:18.510 --> 00:02:18.520 
there you go it's ketchup which is a

00:02:18.520 --> 00:02:21.250 
there you go it's ketchup which is a
non-newtonian<00:02:19.520> fluid<00:02:20.000> too<00:02:20.180> but<00:02:20.390> it's<00:02:20.540> a<00:02:20.630> shear

00:02:21.250 --> 00:02:21.260 
non-newtonian fluid too but it's a shear

00:02:21.260 --> 00:02:23.650 
non-newtonian fluid too but it's a shear
thinning<00:02:21.770> under<00:02:22.730> stress<00:02:23.030> it<00:02:23.210> gets<00:02:23.360> thinner

00:02:23.650 --> 00:02:23.660 
thinning under stress it gets thinner

00:02:23.660 --> 00:02:26.620 
thinning under stress it gets thinner
and<00:02:23.990> it<00:02:24.920> shouldn't<00:02:25.430> work<00:02:25.490> just<00:02:26.330> like<00:02:26.480> the

00:02:26.620 --> 00:02:26.630 
and it shouldn't work just like the

00:02:26.630 --> 00:02:34.240 
and it shouldn't work just like the
water<00:02:26.810> didn't<00:02:27.440> work<00:02:29.530> okay<00:02:30.560> ketchup<00:02:31.130> hit<00:02:31.760> it

00:02:34.240 --> 00:02:34.250 

00:02:34.250 --> 00:02:36.190 

smell<00:02:34.820> it<00:02:34.910> kitchen<00:02:35.300> I<00:02:35.480> don't<00:02:35.870> like<00:02:35.960> bird

00:02:36.190 --> 00:02:36.200 
smell it kitchen I don't like bird

00:02:36.200 --> 00:02:39.040 
smell it kitchen I don't like bird
ketchup<00:02:36.650> does<00:02:37.250> the<00:02:38.150> ketchup<00:02:38.660> under

00:02:39.040 --> 00:02:39.050 
ketchup does the ketchup under

00:02:39.050 --> 00:02:41.290 
ketchup does the ketchup under
tremendous<00:02:39.590> stress<00:02:40.160> of<00:02:40.430> being<00:02:40.460> accelerated

00:02:41.290 --> 00:02:41.300 
tremendous stress of being accelerated

00:02:41.300 --> 00:02:43.600 
tremendous stress of being accelerated
by<00:02:41.630> a<00:02:41.720> shotgun<00:02:42.080> of<00:02:42.350> course<00:02:42.560> becomes<00:02:43.220> thinner

00:02:43.600 --> 00:02:43.610 
by a shotgun of course becomes thinner

00:02:43.610 --> 00:02:48.270 
by a shotgun of course becomes thinner
and<00:02:43.910> acts<00:02:44.090> like<00:02:44.240> a<00:02:44.390> normal<00:02:46.090> Newtonian<00:02:47.090> fluid

00:02:48.270 --> 00:02:48.280 
and acts like a normal Newtonian fluid

00:02:48.280 --> 00:02:51.300 
and acts like a normal Newtonian fluid
so<00:02:49.280> how<00:02:49.460> will<00:02:49.760> a<00:02:50.030> shear<00:02:50.870> thickening

00:02:51.300 --> 00:02:51.310 
so how will a shear thickening

00:02:51.310 --> 00:02:58.870 
so how will a shear thickening
non-newtonian<00:02:52.310> fluid<00:02:53.060> behave<00:02:57.370> it's<00:02:58.370> survived

00:02:58.870 --> 00:02:58.880 
non-newtonian fluid behave it's survived

00:02:58.880 --> 00:03:01.480 
non-newtonian fluid behave it's survived
they<00:02:59.150> went<00:02:59.330> through<00:02:59.510> the<00:02:59.630> wood<00:02:59.780> terrible<00:03:00.770> eyed

00:03:01.480 --> 00:03:01.490 
they went through the wood terrible eyed

00:03:01.490 --> 00:03:03.940 
they went through the wood terrible eyed
accuracy<00:03:02.120> though<00:03:02.300> so<00:03:03.110> it<00:03:03.230> definitely<00:03:03.620> worked

00:03:03.940 --> 00:03:03.950 
accuracy though so it definitely worked

00:03:03.950 --> 00:03:07.870 
accuracy though so it definitely worked
and<00:03:04.630> you<00:03:05.630> can<00:03:05.780> see<00:03:05.960> a<00:03:05.990> little<00:03:06.380> miss<00:03:06.860> like<00:03:07.580> maybe

00:03:07.870 --> 00:03:07.880 
and you can see a little miss like maybe

00:03:07.880 --> 00:03:10.030 
and you can see a little miss like maybe
the<00:03:08.090> Oobleck<00:03:08.510> was<00:03:08.690> leaking<00:03:09.050> out<00:03:09.230> and<00:03:09.530> it<00:03:09.890> could

00:03:10.030 --> 00:03:10.040 
the Oobleck was leaking out and it could

00:03:10.040 --> 00:03:11.950 
the Oobleck was leaking out and it could
have<00:03:10.130> been<00:03:10.220> our<00:03:10.340> little<00:03:10.640> plug<00:03:10.970> had<00:03:11.420> fallen<00:03:11.750> out

00:03:11.950 --> 00:03:11.960 
have been our little plug had fallen out

00:03:11.960 --> 00:03:14.230 
have been our little plug had fallen out
when<00:03:12.170> it<00:03:12.260> we<00:03:12.380> shot<00:03:12.680> it<00:03:12.890> but<00:03:13.700> the<00:03:13.850> capsule

00:03:14.230 --> 00:03:14.240 
when it we shot it but the capsule

00:03:14.240 --> 00:03:18.550 
when it we shot it but the capsule
definitely<00:03:14.930> remained<00:03:15.290> hole<00:03:16.220> and<00:03:17.260> you<00:03:18.260> can<00:03:18.380> see

00:03:18.550 --> 00:03:18.560 
definitely remained hole and you can see

00:03:18.560 --> 00:03:21.040 
definitely remained hole and you can see
even<00:03:18.800> when<00:03:19.130> it<00:03:19.280> impacted<00:03:20.030> it<00:03:20.270> didn't<00:03:20.570> splatter

00:03:21.040 --> 00:03:21.050 
even when it impacted it didn't splatter

00:03:21.050 --> 00:03:24.100 
even when it impacted it didn't splatter
like<00:03:21.200> a<00:03:21.440> liquid<00:03:22.010> would<00:03:22.220> and<00:03:22.490> it<00:03:23.000> actually<00:03:23.420> blew

00:03:24.100 --> 00:03:24.110 
like a liquid would and it actually blew

00:03:24.110 --> 00:03:26.200 
like a liquid would and it actually blew
a<00:03:24.140> hole<00:03:24.470> right<00:03:24.500> through<00:03:24.770> that<00:03:25.210> three-quarter

00:03:26.200 --> 00:03:26.210 
a hole right through that three-quarter

00:03:26.210 --> 00:03:28.750 
a hole right through that three-quarter
inch<00:03:26.360> plywood<00:03:26.680> or<00:03:27.680> about<00:03:28.010> 20<00:03:28.370> millimeter

00:03:28.750 --> 00:03:28.760 
inch plywood or about 20 millimeter

00:03:28.760 --> 00:03:40.690 
inch plywood or about 20 millimeter
thick

00:03:40.690 --> 00:03:40.700 

00:03:40.700 --> 00:03:42.610 

so<00:03:41.240> we'll<00:03:41.360> try<00:03:41.540> it<00:03:41.630> again<00:03:41.810> we<00:03:42.140> have<00:03:42.260> another

00:03:42.610 --> 00:03:42.620 
so we'll try it again we have another

00:03:42.620 --> 00:03:44.500 
so we'll try it again we have another
Oobleck<00:03:43.040> round<00:03:43.370> and<00:03:43.940> we'll<00:03:44.060> see<00:03:44.180> if<00:03:44.270> we<00:03:44.360> have

00:03:44.500 --> 00:03:44.510 
Oobleck round and we'll see if we have

00:03:44.510 --> 00:03:47.559 
Oobleck round and we'll see if we have
any<00:03:44.660> different<00:03:45.080> results<00:03:45.500> this<00:03:45.650> time<00:03:46.569> we'll

00:03:47.559 --> 00:03:47.569 
any different results this time we'll

00:03:47.569 --> 00:03:50.440 
any different results this time we'll
see<00:03:47.690> if<00:03:47.780> the<00:03:47.930> second<00:03:48.290> one<00:03:49.000> does<00:03:50.000> as<00:03:50.150> well<00:03:50.330> as

00:03:50.440 --> 00:03:50.450 
see if the second one does as well as

00:03:50.450 --> 00:03:56.460 
see if the second one does as well as
the<00:03:50.540> first<00:03:50.660> one<00:03:51.580> yeah<00:03:52.580> I'm<00:03:52.730> ready

00:03:56.460 --> 00:03:56.470 

00:03:56.470 --> 00:04:03.809 

it<00:03:57.470> stayed<00:03:57.800> solid<00:03:58.100> and<00:03:58.520> low<00:03:59.420> I<00:03:59.540> think

00:04:03.809 --> 00:04:03.819 

00:04:03.819 --> 00:04:06.220 

so<00:04:04.819> the<00:04:04.910> second<00:04:05.330> shot<00:04:05.510> definitely<00:04:05.690> proved

00:04:06.220 --> 00:04:06.230 
so the second shot definitely proved

00:04:06.230 --> 00:04:09.790 
so the second shot definitely proved
that<00:04:06.440> the<00:04:07.280> capsule<00:04:08.239> full<00:04:08.750> of<00:04:08.840> Oobleck<00:04:09.230> will

00:04:09.790 --> 00:04:09.800 
that the capsule full of Oobleck will

00:04:09.800 --> 00:04:12.640 
that the capsule full of Oobleck will
hold<00:04:10.340> together<00:04:10.519> won't<00:04:11.030> be<00:04:11.930> blown<00:04:12.200> out<00:04:12.380> by<00:04:12.590> the

00:04:12.640 --> 00:04:12.650 
hold together won't be blown out by the

00:04:12.650 --> 00:04:16.060 
hold together won't be blown out by the
shockwave<00:04:13.010> from<00:04:13.250> the<00:04:13.550> shotgun<00:04:14.800> the<00:04:15.800> biggest

00:04:16.060 --> 00:04:16.070 
shockwave from the shotgun the biggest

00:04:16.070 --> 00:04:17.140 
shockwave from the shotgun the biggest
problem<00:04:16.310> with<00:04:16.370> these<00:04:16.519> rounds<00:04:16.880> is<00:04:16.970> they're

00:04:17.140 --> 00:04:17.150 
problem with these rounds is they're

00:04:17.150 --> 00:04:20.170 
problem with these rounds is they're
very<00:04:17.419> lightweight<00:04:17.930> and<00:04:18.380> they<00:04:18.979> don't<00:04:19.190> fly<00:04:19.910> very

00:04:20.170 --> 00:04:20.180 
very lightweight and they don't fly very

00:04:20.180 --> 00:04:23.379 
very lightweight and they don't fly very
straight<00:04:20.540> but<00:04:21.280> the<00:04:22.280> Oobleck<00:04:22.729> did<00:04:23.150> behave

00:04:23.379 --> 00:04:23.389 
straight but the Oobleck did behave

00:04:23.389 --> 00:04:27.610 
straight but the Oobleck did behave
exactly<00:04:23.990> like<00:04:24.710> it<00:04:25.340> should<00:04:25.370> have<00:04:25.610> I<00:04:26.470> don't<00:04:27.470> know

00:04:27.610 --> 00:04:27.620 
exactly like it should have I don't know

00:04:27.620 --> 00:04:30.810 
exactly like it should have I don't know
I<00:04:27.650> guess<00:04:27.860> I<00:04:28.660> need<00:04:29.660> a<00:04:29.690> bigger<00:04:29.900> jug<00:04:30.200> next<00:04:30.530> time

00:04:30.810 --> 00:04:30.820 
I guess I need a bigger jug next time

00:04:30.820 --> 00:04:34.450 
I guess I need a bigger jug next time
but<00:04:31.820> I<00:04:32.320> if<00:04:33.320> I<00:04:33.470> was<00:04:33.620> the<00:04:33.710> guess<00:04:33.889> it<00:04:34.100> hit<00:04:34.280> right

00:04:34.450 --> 00:04:34.460 
but I if I was the guess it hit right

00:04:34.460 --> 00:04:39.190 
but I if I was the guess it hit right
here<00:04:35.860> we'll<00:04:36.860> have<00:04:37.010> to<00:04:37.100> look<00:04:37.220> at<00:04:37.370> the<00:04:38.200> ultra

00:04:39.190 --> 00:04:39.200 
here we'll have to look at the ultra

00:04:39.200 --> 00:04:45.520 
here we'll have to look at the ultra
super<00:04:39.919> duper<00:04:40.400> slow-mo<00:04:42.160> economy<00:04:43.160> slow-mo
