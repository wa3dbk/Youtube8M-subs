weird<00:02:12.910> thing<00:02:12.940> here<00:02:13.450> that's<00:02:13.480> doing<00:02:14.110> is<00:02:14.260> that

00:02:14.400 --> 00:02:14.410 
weird thing here that's doing is that

00:02:14.410 --> 00:02:16.680 
weird thing here that's doing is that
when<00:02:14.650> I<00:02:14.680> tap<00:02:14.950> on<00:02:15.010> Wi-Fi<00:02:15.580> it<00:02:16.030> immediately

00:02:16.680 --> 00:02:16.690 
when I tap on Wi-Fi it immediately

00:02:16.690 --> 00:02:19.619 
when I tap on Wi-Fi it immediately
instead<00:02:17.170> of<00:02:17.319> just<00:02:17.440> enable<00:02:18.310> it<00:02:18.480> what<00:02:19.480> it's

00:02:19.619 --> 00:02:19.629 
instead of just enable it what it's

00:02:19.629 --> 00:02:22.339 
instead of just enable it what it's
doing<00:02:20.140> here<00:02:20.440> is<00:02:20.620> that<00:02:20.830> it<00:02:20.980> jumps<00:02:21.580> into<00:02:21.790> the<00:02:22.090> app

00:02:22.339 --> 00:02:22.349 
doing here is that it jumps into the app

00:02:22.349 --> 00:02:26.460 
doing here is that it jumps into the app
like<00:02:23.349> why<00:02:23.700> there's<00:02:24.700> only<00:02:24.940> one<00:02:25.150> thing<00:02:25.420> you<00:02:25.840> do

00:02:34.480 --> 00:02:37.080 
one tap on and off why do you open up
these<00:02:35.040> in<00:02:36.040> touch<00:02:36.310> ways<00:02:36.549> it<00:02:36.700> basically<00:02:36.910> works

00:02:37.080 --> 00:02:37.090 
these in touch ways it basically works

00:02:37.090 --> 00:02:40.890 
these in touch ways it basically works
like<00:02:37.299> you<00:02:37.840> hold<00:02:38.170> in<00:02:38.650> on<00:02:39.370> it<00:02:39.819> and<00:02:40.090> then<00:02:40.299> it<00:02:40.510> open

00:02:40.890 --> 00:02:40.900 
like you hold in on it and then it open

00:02:40.900 --> 00:02:43.289 
like you hold in on it and then it open
up<00:02:40.989> the<00:02:41.709> app<00:02:41.829> and<00:02:41.860> that's<00:02:42.310> perfect<00:02:42.819> they

00:02:43.289 --> 00:02:43.299 
up the app and that's perfect they

00:02:43.299 --> 00:02:44.550 
up the app and that's perfect they
should<00:02:43.450> definitely<00:02:43.780> change<00:02:43.959> that<00:02:44.230> as<00:02:44.349> well

00:02:44.550 --> 00:02:44.560 
should definitely change that as well

00:02:44.560 --> 00:02:47.880 
should definitely change that as well
