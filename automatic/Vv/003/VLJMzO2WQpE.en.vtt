00:00:15.919 --> 00:00:15.929 
on this hole here and here what's going

00:00:15.929 --> 00:00:17.420 
on this hole here and here what's going
to<00:00:15.960> happen<00:00:16.260> is<00:00:16.320> we'll<00:00:16.470> thread<00:00:16.920> our<00:00:16.980> hardware

00:00:17.420 --> 00:00:17.430 
to happen is we'll thread our hardware

00:00:17.430 --> 00:00:20.240 
to happen is we'll thread our hardware
from<00:00:17.580> the<00:00:17.760> edge<00:00:18.150> of<00:00:18.420> a<00:00:18.510> frame<00:00:18.840> there's<00:00:19.830> opening

00:00:20.240 --> 00:00:20.250 
from the edge of a frame there's opening

00:00:20.250 --> 00:00:22.220 
from the edge of a frame there's opening
back<00:00:20.460> here<00:00:20.910> that<00:00:21.480> will<00:00:21.570> pull<00:00:21.810> our<00:00:21.930> hardware

00:00:22.220 --> 00:00:22.230 
back here that will pull our hardware

00:00:22.230 --> 00:00:23.900 
back here that will pull our hardware
through<00:00:22.500> from<00:00:22.740> the<00:00:22.830> inside<00:00:23.189> out

00:00:23.900 --> 00:00:23.910 
through from the inside out

00:00:23.910 --> 00:00:27.019 
through from the inside out
now<00:00:24.869> some<00:00:25.199> vehicles<00:00:25.710> will<00:00:26.490> be<00:00:26.580> an<00:00:26.670> exhaust

00:00:27.019 --> 00:00:27.029 
now some vehicles will be an exhaust

the instructions provided to do that but
in<00:00:31.949> this<00:00:32.040> case<00:00:32.219> there's<00:00:32.489> not<00:00:32.669> one<00:00:32.850> existing<00:00:33.360> so

00:00:33.440 --> 00:00:33.450 
in this case there's not one existing so

00:00:33.450 --> 00:00:35.209 
in this case there's not one existing so
you<00:00:33.510> don't<00:00:33.690> have<00:00:33.780> to<00:00:33.899> worry<00:00:34.110> about<00:00:34.230> it<00:00:34.500> and<00:00:34.649> if

per side and there is a difference in

00:00:59.280 --> 00:01:01.069 
per side and there is a difference in
the<00:00:59.430> bolts<00:00:59.699> to<00:00:59.969> one's<00:01:00.390> just<00:01:00.600> basically<00:01:00.899> going

00:01:01.069 --> 00:01:01.079 
the bolts to one's just basically going

00:01:01.079 --> 00:01:03.590 
the bolts to one's just basically going
to<00:01:01.140> be<00:01:01.230> longer<00:01:01.469> than<00:01:01.620> the<00:01:01.859> other<00:01:02.390> let's<00:01:03.390> go<00:01:03.539> to

00:01:03.590 --> 00:01:03.600 
to be longer than the other let's go to

00:01:03.600 --> 00:01:06.590 
to be longer than the other let's go to
1/2<00:01:03.840> is<00:01:03.960> this<00:01:04.110> short<00:01:04.409> bolt<00:01:05.060> then<00:01:06.060> go<00:01:06.210> in<00:01:06.450> the

00:01:06.590 --> 00:01:06.600 
1/2 is this short bolt then go in the

00:01:06.600 --> 00:01:10.190 
1/2 is this short bolt then go in the
front<00:01:06.810> hole<00:01:07.020> here<00:01:08.510> I'm<00:01:09.510> sorry<00:01:09.780> to<00:01:09.869> rearward

00:01:10.190 --> 00:01:10.200 
front hole here I'm sorry to rearward

00:01:10.200 --> 00:01:12.289 
front hole here I'm sorry to rearward
I'm<00:01:10.590> sorry<00:01:10.830> the<00:01:11.040> rear<00:01:11.220> most<00:01:11.400> hole<00:01:11.640> here<00:01:12.000> and

00:01:12.289 --> 00:01:12.299 
I'm sorry the rear most hole here and

00:01:12.299 --> 00:01:14.450 
I'm sorry the rear most hole here and
then<00:01:13.140> two<00:01:13.229> longer<00:01:13.590> bolts<00:01:13.890> gonna<00:01:14.130> go<00:01:14.220> in<00:01:14.340> this

00:01:14.450 --> 00:01:14.460 
then two longer bolts gonna go in this

00:01:14.460 --> 00:01:19.219 
then two longer bolts gonna go in this
hole<00:01:16.340> and<00:01:17.340> it's<00:01:17.670> going<00:01:17.790> to<00:01:17.850> get<00:01:17.909> a<00:01:17.970> spacer<00:01:18.450> flip

00:01:19.219 --> 00:01:19.229 
hole and it's going to get a spacer flip

00:01:19.229 --> 00:01:21.859 
hole and it's going to get a spacer flip
between<00:01:19.590> the<00:01:20.340> frame<00:01:20.670> and<00:01:20.880> the<00:01:20.970> hitch<00:01:21.420> itself

00:01:21.859 --> 00:01:21.869 
between the frame and the hitch itself

00:01:21.869 --> 00:01:23.450 
between the frame and the hitch itself
so<00:01:22.350> that's<00:01:22.560> why<00:01:22.710> you<00:01:22.770> want<00:01:22.950> put<00:01:23.040> the<00:01:23.130> longer

00:01:23.450 --> 00:01:23.460 
so that's why you want put the longer

00:01:23.460 --> 00:01:26.450 
so that's why you want put the longer
bolt<00:01:23.670> in<00:01:23.850> the<00:01:24.150> back<00:01:24.770> fish<00:01:25.770> wiring<00:01:26.100> tools<00:01:26.280> and

00:01:26.450 --> 00:01:26.460 
bolt in the back fish wiring tools and

00:01:26.460 --> 00:01:28.490 
bolt in the back fish wiring tools and
start<00:01:26.549> with<00:01:26.729> a<00:01:26.820> bolt<00:01:27.210> in<00:01:27.240> the<00:01:27.360> back<00:01:27.570> we'll<00:01:27.960> go

00:01:28.490 --> 00:01:28.500 
start with a bolt in the back we'll go

00:01:28.500 --> 00:01:30.770 
start with a bolt in the back we'll go
through<00:01:28.650> the<00:01:28.710> hole<00:01:28.890> we're<00:01:29.040> going<00:01:29.220> to<00:01:29.340> use<00:01:29.780> go

00:01:30.770 --> 00:01:30.780 
through the hole we're going to use go

00:01:30.780 --> 00:01:32.330 
through the hole we're going to use go
all<00:01:31.049> the<00:01:31.259> way<00:01:31.290> to<00:01:31.380> the<00:01:31.560> end<00:01:31.680> of<00:01:31.740> the<00:01:31.799> frame<00:01:32.130> and

00:01:32.330 --> 00:01:32.340 
all the way to the end of the frame and

00:01:32.340 --> 00:01:35.899 
all the way to the end of the frame and
pull<00:01:32.520> it<00:01:32.670> out<00:01:32.850> okay<00:01:33.810> and<00:01:34.200> it's<00:01:34.829> just<00:01:35.640> long

00:01:35.899 --> 00:01:35.909 
pull it out okay and it's just long

00:01:35.909 --> 00:01:37.520 
pull it out okay and it's just long
enough<00:01:35.939> so<00:01:36.270> be<00:01:36.600> careful<00:01:36.930> you<00:01:36.960> don't<00:01:37.140> push<00:01:37.350> the

00:01:37.520 --> 00:01:37.530 
enough so be careful you don't push the

00:01:37.530 --> 00:01:41.359 
enough so be careful you don't push the
wire<00:01:37.710> back<00:01:37.950> into<00:01:37.979> the<00:01:38.220> frame<00:01:40.040> take<00:01:41.040> your<00:01:41.159> block

00:01:41.359 --> 00:01:41.369 
wire back into the frame take your block

that block you just push it on in on the

00:01:59.149 --> 00:02:07.990 
that block you just push it on in on the
wire<00:02:05.979> and<00:02:06.979> go<00:02:07.189> into<00:02:07.310> the<00:02:07.490> back<00:02:07.610> of<00:02:07.640> also<00:02:07.939> I'm

00:02:07.990 --> 00:02:08.000 
wire and go into the back of also I'm

00:02:08.000 --> 00:02:12.520 
wire and go into the back of also I'm
going<00:02:08.119> to<00:02:08.179> use<00:02:08.269> the<00:02:08.390> long<00:02:08.630> bolt<00:02:11.500> thread<00:02:12.500> that

00:02:12.520 --> 00:02:12.530 
going to use the long bolt thread that

00:02:12.530 --> 00:02:21.020 
going to use the long bolt thread that
into<00:02:12.800> place

00:02:21.020 --> 00:02:21.030 

00:02:21.030 --> 00:02:29.220 

I'll<00:02:22.030> pull<00:02:22.270> the<00:02:22.360> whole<00:02:22.540> assembly<00:02:22.690> through<00:02:28.230> and

00:02:29.220 --> 00:02:29.230 
I'll pull the whole assembly through and

00:02:29.230 --> 00:02:35.309 
I'll pull the whole assembly through and
out

00:02:35.309 --> 00:02:35.319 

00:02:35.319 --> 00:02:38.080 

do<00:02:36.319> the<00:02:36.409> same<00:02:36.560> thing<00:02:36.799> with<00:02:36.980> the<00:02:37.129> rear<00:02:37.940> most

00:02:38.080 --> 00:02:38.090

hole<00:02:38.360> here<00:02:47.019> all<00:02:48.019> right<00:02:48.230> same<00:02:48.739> thing<00:02:48.920> again

00:02:49.180 --> 00:02:49.190 
hole here all right same thing again

00:02:49.190 --> 00:03:02.140 
hole here all right same thing again
it's<00:02:50.150> a<00:02:50.180> little<00:02:50.239> easier<00:02:50.690> to<00:02:50.780> see<00:02:59.290> and<00:03:00.879> a<00:03:01.879> short

it's a little easier to see and a short

00:03:02.150 --> 00:03:17.850 
it's a little easier to see and a short
bolt<00:03:03.340> will<00:03:04.340> go<00:03:04.489> here

00:03:17.850 --> 00:03:17.860 

00:03:17.860 --> 00:03:19.660

00:03:40.630 --> 00:03:40.640 
first and then the forward bolts will

00:03:40.640 --> 00:03:42.190 
first and then the forward bolts will
leave<00:03:40.880> alone<00:03:41.150> because<00:03:41.630> we<00:03:41.660> have<00:03:41.810> to<00:03:41.870> push<00:03:42.020> up

00:03:42.190 --> 00:03:42.200

little bit let's call our block let it
fall<00:04:19.780> back<00:04:19.959> through<00:04:20.670> then<00:04:21.670> we'll<00:04:21.790> put<00:04:21.970> our<00:04:22.060> nut

00:04:22.230 --> 00:04:22.240 
fall back through then we'll put our nut

00:04:22.240 --> 00:04:24.450 
fall back through then we'll put our nut
and<00:04:22.390> washer<00:04:22.510> on<00:04:22.840> here<00:04:22.870> keep<00:04:23.380> it<00:04:23.500> from<00:04:23.620> coming

00:04:24.450 --> 00:04:24.460 
and washer on here keep it from coming

00:04:24.460 --> 00:04:33.750 
and washer on here keep it from coming
back<00:04:24.730> out<00:04:29.790> yeah<00:04:32.250> okay<00:04:33.250> just<00:04:33.280> a<00:04:33.490> couple<00:04:33.700> of

00:04:33.750 --> 00:04:33.760 
back out yeah okay just a couple of

00:04:33.760 --> 00:04:34.800 
back out yeah okay just a couple of
threads<00:04:34.000> because<00:04:34.180> we're<00:04:34.330> still<00:04:34.540> going<00:04:34.690> to<00:04:34.750> do

00:04:34.800 --> 00:04:34.810 
threads because we're still going to do

00:04:34.810 --> 00:05:05.200 
threads because we're still going to do
this<00:04:34.930> on<00:04:35.140> the<00:04:35.290> other<00:04:35.410> side

00:05:05.200 --> 00:05:05.210 

00:05:05.210 --> 00:05:06.680 

there<00:05:06.210> you<00:05:06.360> go

00:05:06.680 --> 00:05:06.690 
there you go

there you go
all<00:05:07.650> right<00:05:07.770> next<00:05:08.009> to<00:05:08.070> work<00:05:08.220> on<00:05:08.400> total<00:05:08.669> tip

00:05:08.749 --> 00:05:08.759 
all right next to work on total tip

00:05:08.759 --> 00:05:12.140 
all right next to work on total tip
assembly<00:05:10.490> that's<00:05:11.490> why<00:05:11.610> we<00:05:11.729> leave<00:05:11.880> it<00:05:11.970> loose<00:05:12.090> so

00:05:12.140 --> 00:05:12.150 
assembly that's why we leave it loose so

00:05:12.150 --> 00:05:13.999 
assembly that's why we leave it loose so
we<00:05:12.300> can<00:05:12.389> move<00:05:12.509> it<00:05:12.690> around<00:05:12.770> we'll<00:05:13.770> put<00:05:13.889> our

00:05:13.999 --> 00:05:14.009 
we can move it around we'll put our

00:05:14.009 --> 00:05:16.790 
we can move it around we'll put our
spacer<00:05:14.370> block<00:05:14.600> between<00:05:15.600> the<00:05:15.900> hitch<00:05:16.080> and<00:05:16.380> until

00:05:16.790 --> 00:05:16.800 
spacer block between the hitch and until

00:05:16.800 --> 00:05:22.689 
spacer block between the hitch and until
loop<00:05:17.009> and<00:05:17.509> then<00:05:20.479> that<00:05:21.479> block<00:05:21.720> on<00:05:21.990> the<00:05:22.080> outside

00:05:22.689 --> 00:05:22.699 
loop and then that block on the outside

00:05:22.699 --> 00:05:26.840 
loop and then that block on the outside
with<00:05:23.699> the<00:05:23.729> carriage<00:05:24.120> bolt<00:05:25.220> now<00:05:26.220> run<00:05:26.490> all<00:05:26.729> the

00:05:26.840 --> 00:05:26.850 
with the carriage bolt now run all the

00:05:26.850 --> 00:05:30.650 
with the carriage bolt now run all the
way<00:05:26.940> through<00:05:28.250> and<00:05:29.250> then<00:05:29.370> follow<00:05:30.240> it<00:05:30.330> up<00:05:30.449> the

00:05:30.650 --> 00:05:30.660 
way through and then follow it up the

00:05:30.660 --> 00:05:46.770 
way through and then follow it up the
lock<00:05:30.870> washer<00:05:31.289> and

00:05:46.770 --> 00:05:46.780 

00:05:46.780 --> 00:05:48.360 

since<00:05:47.380> we<00:05:47.440> got<00:05:47.560> all<00:05:47.650> our<00:05:47.680> hardware<00:05:48.100> installed

00:05:48.360 --> 00:05:48.370 
since we got all our hardware installed

00:05:48.370 --> 00:05:49.530 
since we got all our hardware installed
now<00:05:48.580> we'll<00:05:48.790> go<00:05:48.910> ahead<00:05:48.940> and<00:05:49.060> snug<00:05:49.300> down<00:05:49.360> the

00:05:49.530 --> 00:05:49.540 
now we'll go ahead and snug down the

00:05:49.540 --> 00:05:51.780 
now we'll go ahead and snug down the
bolts<00:05:49.770> make<00:05:50.770> sure<00:05:50.920> the<00:05:51.010> hitch<00:05:51.160> sits<00:05:51.520> the<00:05:51.670> way

00:05:51.780 --> 00:05:51.790 
bolts make sure the hitch sits the way
