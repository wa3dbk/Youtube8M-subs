00:00:03.769 --> 00:00:03.779 
okay you're gonna need a lab book for

00:00:03.779 --> 00:00:06.889 
okay you're gonna need a lab book for
this<00:00:03.840> class<00:00:04.160> all<00:00:05.160> scientists<00:00:05.759> use<00:00:05.970> lab<00:00:06.600> looks

00:00:06.889 --> 00:00:06.899 
this class all scientists use lab looks

00:00:06.899 --> 00:00:08.900 
this class all scientists use lab looks
a<00:00:07.200> lot<00:00:07.859> like<00:00:08.040> this<00:00:08.280> one<00:00:08.340> they're<00:00:08.610> probably<00:00:08.759> a

00:00:08.900 --> 00:00:08.910 
a lot like this one they're probably a

00:00:08.910 --> 00:00:10.940 
a lot like this one they're probably a
little<00:00:09.000> fancier<00:00:09.540> and<00:00:10.410> they<00:00:10.589> may<00:00:10.710> be<00:00:10.769> got<00:00:10.920> a

00:00:10.940 --> 00:00:10.950 
little fancier and they may be got a

00:00:10.950 --> 00:00:12.440 
little fancier and they may be got a
hard<00:00:11.280> to<00:00:11.370> cover<00:00:11.549> on<00:00:11.790> them<00:00:11.910> this<00:00:12.059> is<00:00:12.210> just<00:00:12.240> a

00:00:12.440 --> 00:00:12.450 
hard to cover on them this is just a

00:00:12.450 --> 00:00:14.780 
hard to cover on them this is just a
regular<00:00:12.599> composition<00:00:13.589> book<00:00:13.830> but<00:00:14.490> the<00:00:14.610> thing

00:00:14.780 --> 00:00:14.790 
regular composition book but the thing

00:00:14.790 --> 00:00:16.490 
regular composition book but the thing
that<00:00:14.820> they<00:00:15.030> have<00:00:15.209> in<00:00:15.330> common<00:00:15.360> is<00:00:15.900> that<00:00:16.080> they

00:00:16.490 --> 00:00:16.500 
that they have in common is that they

00:00:16.500 --> 00:00:19.610 
that they have in common is that they
have<00:00:16.530> a<00:00:16.680> bound<00:00:16.980> edge<00:00:17.400> and<00:00:17.700> these<00:00:18.090> pages<00:00:18.620> don't

00:00:19.610 --> 00:00:19.620 
have a bound edge and these pages don't

00:00:19.620 --> 00:00:22.940 
have a bound edge and these pages don't
come<00:00:19.950> out<00:00:21.020> what<00:00:22.020> that<00:00:22.170> it<00:00:22.470> keeps<00:00:22.620> you<00:00:22.800> from

00:00:22.940 --> 00:00:22.950 
come out what that it keeps you from

00:00:22.950 --> 00:00:24.560 
come out what that it keeps you from
putting<00:00:23.280> in<00:00:23.490> pages<00:00:23.970> and<00:00:24.150> it<00:00:24.240> keeps<00:00:24.390> you<00:00:24.480> from

00:00:24.560 --> 00:00:24.570 
putting in pages and it keeps you from

00:00:24.570 --> 00:00:27.340 
putting in pages and it keeps you from
taking<00:00:24.780> them<00:00:25.110> out<00:00:25.230> which<00:00:25.980> is<00:00:26.100> important<00:00:26.610> for

00:00:27.340 --> 00:00:27.350 
taking them out which is important for

00:00:27.350 --> 00:00:30.110 
taking them out which is important for
try<00:00:28.350> and<00:00:28.440> get<00:00:28.560> your<00:00:28.680> ideas<00:00:28.980> patent<00:00:29.430> because

00:00:30.110 --> 00:00:30.120 
try and get your ideas patent because

00:00:30.120 --> 00:00:32.150 
try and get your ideas patent because
you<00:00:30.360> have<00:00:30.510> to<00:00:30.630> show<00:00:30.840> what<00:00:31.260> you<00:00:31.410> did<00:00:31.680> and<00:00:31.950> when

00:00:32.150 --> 00:00:32.160 
you have to show what you did and when

00:00:32.160 --> 00:00:32.630 
you have to show what you did and when
you<00:00:32.189> did<00:00:32.460> it

00:00:32.630 --> 00:00:32.640 
you did it

00:00:32.640 --> 00:00:35.509 
you did it
in<00:00:32.759> order<00:00:33.149> to<00:00:33.440> actually<00:00:34.440> get<00:00:34.679> credit<00:00:34.829> for<00:00:35.160> a

00:00:35.509 --> 00:00:35.519 
in order to actually get credit for a

00:00:35.519 --> 00:00:37.509 
in order to actually get credit for a
patent<00:00:36.000> for<00:00:36.030> an<00:00:36.300> idea<00:00:36.570> that<00:00:36.780> you<00:00:36.899> might<00:00:37.050> have

00:00:37.509 --> 00:00:37.519 
patent for an idea that you might have

00:00:37.519 --> 00:00:40.040 
patent for an idea that you might have
otherwise<00:00:38.519> you'd<00:00:38.879> come<00:00:39.089> up<00:00:39.149> the<00:00:39.269> same<00:00:39.449> idea

00:00:40.040 --> 00:00:40.050 
otherwise you'd come up the same idea

00:00:40.050 --> 00:00:43.639 
otherwise you'd come up the same idea
pretend<00:00:40.859> that<00:00:40.949> you<00:00:41.190> had<00:00:41.370> a<00:00:41.399> notebook<00:00:41.670> that<00:00:42.649> had

00:00:43.639 --> 00:00:43.649 
pretend that you had a notebook that had

00:00:43.649 --> 00:00:48.610 
pretend that you had a notebook that had
certain<00:00:44.129> pages<00:00:44.519> in<00:00:44.969> that<00:00:45.710> showed<00:00:46.710> the<00:00:46.890> idea

00:00:48.610 --> 00:00:48.620 
certain pages in that showed the idea

00:00:48.620 --> 00:00:52.309 
certain pages in that showed the idea
just<00:00:49.620> by<00:00:49.999> adding<00:00:50.999> them<00:00:51.239> in<00:00:51.359> ahead<00:00:51.510> of<00:00:51.659> time<00:00:51.839> but

00:00:52.309 --> 00:00:52.319 
just by adding them in ahead of time but

00:00:52.319 --> 00:00:53.899 
just by adding them in ahead of time but
a<00:00:52.379> bound<00:00:52.620> notebook<00:00:52.859> like<00:00:53.249> this<00:00:53.429> prevents<00:00:53.789> this

00:00:53.899 --> 00:00:53.909 
a bound notebook like this prevents this

00:00:53.909 --> 00:00:56.419 
a bound notebook like this prevents this
from<00:00:53.969> happening<00:00:54.149> so<00:00:54.749> all<00:00:55.050> scientists<00:00:55.800> use<00:00:56.069> or

00:00:56.419 --> 00:00:56.429 
from happening so all scientists use or

00:00:56.429 --> 00:00:59.509 
from happening so all scientists use or
something<00:00:56.789> very<00:00:57.239> much<00:00:57.359> like<00:00:57.719> this<00:00:57.920> so<00:00:58.920> we're

00:00:59.509 --> 00:00:59.519 
something very much like this so we're

00:00:59.519 --> 00:01:03.469 
something very much like this so we're
gonna<00:00:59.609> start<00:00:59.969> by<00:01:01.309> putting<00:01:02.309> the<00:01:02.699> title<00:01:03.210> on<00:01:03.329> the

00:01:03.469 --> 00:01:03.479 
gonna start by putting the title on the

00:01:03.479 --> 00:01:06.140 
gonna start by putting the title on the
cover<00:01:03.690> so<00:01:04.620> we're<00:01:04.739> going<00:01:04.890> to<00:01:04.950> call<00:01:05.160> this<00:01:05.370> and

00:01:06.140 --> 00:01:06.150 
cover so we're going to call this and

00:01:06.150 --> 00:01:14.900 
cover so we're going to call this and
we'll<00:01:06.330> call<00:01:06.450> this<00:01:06.570> our<00:01:07.100> physics<00:01:11.060> lab<00:01:13.040> book<00:01:14.040> so

00:01:14.900 --> 00:01:14.910 
we'll call this our physics lab book so

00:01:14.910 --> 00:01:16.520 
we'll call this our physics lab book so
put<00:01:15.030> the<00:01:15.090> title<00:01:15.330> on<00:01:15.360> it<00:01:15.570> put<00:01:15.870> your<00:01:15.900> name<00:01:16.260> on<00:01:16.290> it

nine and ten
so<00:04:53.219> I<00:04:53.250> circled<00:04:53.699> the<00:04:53.759> page<00:04:53.939> numbers<00:04:54.330> now<00:04:54.449> that

00:04:54.589 --> 00:04:54.599 
so I circled the page numbers now that

00:04:54.599 --> 00:05:00.050 
so I circled the page numbers now that
took<00:04:54.780> me<00:04:55.819> 34<00:04:56.819> seconds<00:04:57.509> to<00:04:57.659> do<00:04:57.949> so<00:04:58.949> if<00:04:59.460> I<00:04:59.669> were<00:04:59.849> to

00:05:00.050 --> 00:05:00.060 
took me 34 seconds to do so if I were to

00:05:00.060 --> 00:05:00.679 
took me 34 seconds to do so if I were to
do<00:05:00.210> that

00:05:00.679 --> 00:05:00.689 
do that

00:05:00.689 --> 00:05:04.189 
do that
ten<00:05:01.469> more<00:05:01.650> times<00:05:01.979> it<00:05:02.759> would<00:05:02.939> take<00:05:03.199> five

00:05:04.189 --> 00:05:04.199 
ten more times it would take five

00:05:04.199 --> 00:05:09.170 
ten more times it would take five
minutes<00:05:05.960> now<00:05:06.960> this<00:05:07.349> page<00:05:07.650> has<00:05:08.129> this<00:05:08.789> book<00:05:09.030> has

00:05:09.170 --> 00:05:09.180 
minutes now this page has this book has

00:05:09.180 --> 00:05:12.290 
minutes now this page has this book has
200<00:05:09.599> pages<00:05:09.810> in<00:05:10.050> it<00:05:10.169> so<00:05:10.800> it<00:05:11.699> would<00:05:11.879> take<00:05:11.909> me

00:05:12.290 --> 00:05:12.300 
200 pages in it so it would take me

00:05:12.300 --> 00:05:14.800 
200 pages in it so it would take me
about<00:05:12.449> 10<00:05:12.870> minutes<00:05:13.110> to<00:05:13.710> finish<00:05:13.889> this<00:05:14.159> book<00:05:14.460> I

about 10 minutes to finish this book I

00:05:14.810 --> 00:05:16.700 
about 10 minutes to finish this book I
could<00:05:15.810> even<00:05:15.930> do<00:05:16.110> it<00:05:16.229> while<00:05:16.379> I<00:05:16.409> was<00:05:16.530> watching

00:05:16.700 --> 00:05:16.710
