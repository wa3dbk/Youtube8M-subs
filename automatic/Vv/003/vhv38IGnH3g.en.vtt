00:00:05.260 --> 00:00:05.270 
guys how to make origami flashes alright

00:00:05.270 --> 00:00:09.280 
guys how to make origami flashes alright
so<00:00:05.479> first<00:00:06.279> you're<00:00:07.279> going<00:00:07.430> to<00:00:07.519> fold<00:00:08.020> eight<00:00:09.020> by

00:00:09.280 --> 00:00:09.290 
so first you're going to fold eight by

00:00:09.290 --> 00:00:13.680 
so first you're going to fold eight by
eight<00:00:09.320> grade<00:00:09.800> 64<00:00:10.790> individual<00:00:11.300> squares

00:00:13.680 --> 00:00:13.690 

00:00:13.690 --> 00:00:17.439 

alright<00:00:15.100> so<00:00:16.100> after<00:00:16.249> that<00:00:16.580> you're<00:00:17.210> going<00:00:17.359> to

alright so after that you're going to
find<00:00:17.689> the<00:00:18.050> middle<00:00:18.380> and<00:00:19.119> then<00:00:20.650> these<00:00:21.650> two<00:00:23.890> times

00:00:24.880 --> 00:00:24.890 
find the middle and then these two times

00:00:24.890 --> 00:00:29.109 
find the middle and then these two times
right<00:00:25.130> here<00:00:26.980> you're<00:00:27.980> going<00:00:28.099> to<00:00:28.159> press<00:00:28.730> like

00:00:35.950 --> 00:00:35.960 
that and make to like lines again and

00:00:35.960 --> 00:00:38.439 
that and make to like lines again and
then<00:00:36.079> you're<00:00:36.230> going<00:00:36.350> to<00:00:37.120> kind<00:00:38.120> of<00:00:38.149> do<00:00:38.269> this

00:00:38.439 --> 00:00:38.449 
then you're going to kind of do this

00:00:38.449 --> 00:00:41.819 
then you're going to kind of do this
kind<00:00:39.170> of<00:00:39.230> hard<00:00:39.440> to<00:00:39.500> explain<00:00:39.620> but<00:00:40.039> you<00:00:40.550> just

00:00:41.819 --> 00:00:41.829 
kind of hard to explain but you just

00:00:41.829 --> 00:00:52.119 
kind of hard to explain but you just
shows<00:00:42.829> up<00:00:42.859> make<00:00:43.489> four<00:00:43.910> squares<00:00:50.829> where<00:00:51.829> we<00:00:51.980> have

00:00:52.119 --> 00:00:52.129 
shows up make four squares where we have

00:00:52.129 --> 00:00:54.479 
shows up make four squares where we have
your<00:00:52.250> four<00:00:52.429> squares<00:00:52.760> you<00:00:53.269> take<00:00:53.750> the<00:00:53.929> short<00:00:54.230> end

00:00:54.479 --> 00:00:54.489 
your four squares you take the short end

00:00:54.489 --> 00:01:00.209 
your four squares you take the short end
that<00:00:55.489> and<00:00:55.789> hold<00:00:56.660> it<00:00:56.839> down<00:00:57.050> over<00:00:57.350> to<00:00:57.649> the<00:00:57.710> Lions

00:01:00.209 --> 00:01:00.219 

00:01:00.219 --> 00:01:03.279 

make<00:01:01.219> a<00:01:01.249> line<00:01:01.609> when<00:01:02.269> the<00:01:02.329> unfolds<00:01:02.899> either

00:01:03.279 --> 00:01:03.289 
make a line when the unfolds either

00:01:03.289 --> 00:01:07.510 
make a line when the unfolds either
that's<00:01:03.379> each<00:01:03.649> side<00:01:04.360> so<00:01:06.040> so<00:01:07.040> once<00:01:07.220> you've<00:01:07.369> done

00:01:07.510 --> 00:01:07.520 
that's each side so so once you've done

00:01:07.520 --> 00:01:10.749 
that's each side so so once you've done
that<00:01:07.579> you're<00:01:07.939> going<00:01:08.000> to<00:01:08.150> take<00:01:08.900> one<00:01:09.549> of<00:01:10.549> the

00:01:10.749 --> 00:01:10.759 
that you're going to take one of the

00:01:10.759 --> 00:01:12.999 
that you're going to take one of the
fours<00:01:11.060> I<00:01:11.360> usually<00:01:11.840> you<00:01:12.200> should<00:01:12.380> go<00:01:12.619> start<00:01:12.920> with

00:01:12.999 --> 00:01:13.009 
fours I usually you should go start with

00:01:13.009 --> 00:01:16.569 
fours I usually you should go start with
this<00:01:13.130> one<00:01:13.189> and<00:01:14.229> you're<00:01:15.229> going<00:01:15.380> to<00:01:15.439> do<00:01:16.189> this

00:01:16.569 --> 00:01:16.579 
this one and you're going to do this

00:01:16.579 --> 00:01:19.270 
this one and you're going to do this
you're<00:01:17.450> going<00:01:17.540> to<00:01:17.630> lift<00:01:17.990> that<00:01:18.200> up<00:01:18.259> like<00:01:19.100> that

00:01:19.270 --> 00:01:19.280 
you're going to lift that up like that

00:01:19.280 --> 00:01:21.910 
you're going to lift that up like that
kind<00:01:19.579> of<00:01:19.640> pull<00:01:20.180> that<00:01:20.390> make<00:01:20.659> those<00:01:21.619> creases

00:01:21.910 --> 00:01:21.920 
kind of pull that make those creases

00:01:21.920 --> 00:01:23.950 
kind of pull that make those creases
more<00:01:22.250> from<00:01:22.430> then<00:01:23.299> you're<00:01:23.540> going<00:01:23.630> to<00:01:23.689> do<00:01:23.810> that

00:01:23.950 --> 00:01:23.960 
more from then you're going to do that

00:01:23.960 --> 00:01:28.060 
more from then you're going to do that
again<00:01:24.350> over<00:01:24.920> here<00:01:26.770> then<00:01:27.770> you're<00:01:27.890> going<00:01:27.979> to

00:01:28.060 --> 00:01:28.070 
again over here then you're going to

00:01:28.070 --> 00:01:32.500 
again over here then you're going to
repeat<00:01:28.310> that<00:01:28.369> until

00:01:32.500 --> 00:01:32.510 

00:01:32.510 --> 00:01:38.380 

the<00:01:33.080> last<00:01:33.290> one<00:01:34.390> steadily<00:01:37.120> and<00:01:38.120> then<00:01:38.270> you

00:01:38.380 --> 00:01:38.390 
the last one steadily and then you

00:01:38.390 --> 00:01:41.500 
the last one steadily and then you
repeat<00:01:38.600> that<00:01:38.660> on<00:01:38.840> this<00:01:39.230> side<00:01:40.210> now<00:01:41.210> when<00:01:41.390> you're

00:01:41.500 --> 00:01:41.510 
repeat that on this side now when you're

00:01:41.510 --> 00:01:42.670 
repeat that on this side now when you're
done<00:01:41.630> with<00:01:41.660> that<00:01:41.810> you're<00:01:42.140> going<00:01:42.290> to<00:01:42.350> do<00:01:42.440> it<00:01:42.530> to

00:01:42.670 --> 00:01:42.680 
done with that you're going to do it to

00:01:42.680 --> 00:01:43.960 
done with that you're going to do it to
the<00:01:42.770> other<00:01:42.830> side<00:01:43.130> except<00:01:43.460> just<00:01:43.640> kind<00:01:43.820> of<00:01:43.850> like

00:01:43.960 --> 00:01:43.970 
the other side except just kind of like

00:01:43.970 --> 00:01:47.110 
the other side except just kind of like
backwards<00:01:44.650> so<00:01:45.650> you're<00:01:45.830> going<00:01:45.950> to<00:01:46.120> basically

00:01:47.110 --> 00:01:47.120 
backwards so you're going to basically

00:01:47.120 --> 00:01:49.600 
backwards so you're going to basically
do<00:01:47.330> it<00:01:47.450> just<00:01:47.720> the<00:01:47.840> exact<00:01:48.110> same<00:01:48.320> thing<00:01:48.620> to<00:01:49.490> the

00:01:49.600 --> 00:01:49.610 
do it just the exact same thing to the

00:01:49.610 --> 00:02:09.870 
do it just the exact same thing to the
other<00:01:49.640> to<00:02:07.960> repeat<00:02:08.960> that<00:02:09.110> on<00:02:09.170> the<00:02:09.260> other<00:02:09.380> side

00:02:09.870 --> 00:02:09.880 
other to repeat that on the other side

00:02:09.880 --> 00:02:13.060 
other to repeat that on the other side
you<00:02:10.880> have<00:02:11.090> the<00:02:11.120> flat<00:02:11.750> version<00:02:12.320> of<00:02:12.500> the<00:02:12.650> origami

00:02:13.060 --> 00:02:13.070 
you have the flat version of the origami

00:02:13.070 --> 00:02:15.430 
you have the flat version of the origami
flasher<00:02:13.490> so<00:02:14.300> then<00:02:14.450> you're<00:02:14.570> going<00:02:14.660> to<00:02:14.720> push

00:02:15.430 --> 00:02:15.440 
flasher so then you're going to push

00:02:15.440 --> 00:02:17.950 
flasher so then you're going to push
pull<00:02:16.070> these<00:02:16.280> up<00:02:16.340> like<00:02:16.670> that<00:02:16.880> kind<00:02:17.600> of<00:02:17.690> form<00:02:17.870> a

00:02:17.950 --> 00:02:17.960 
pull these up like that kind of form a

00:02:17.960 --> 00:02:21.630 
pull these up like that kind of form a
circle<00:02:18.430> and<00:02:19.430> they're<00:02:19.610> going<00:02:19.760> to<00:02:19.820> want<00:02:20.030> like

00:02:21.630 --> 00:02:21.640 
circle and they're going to want like

00:02:21.640 --> 00:02:37.770 
circle and they're going to want like
firm<00:02:22.640> these<00:02:22.880> pieces

00:02:37.770 --> 00:02:37.780 

00:02:37.780 --> 00:02:41.940 

and<00:02:38.780> this<00:02:38.930> is<00:02:39.080> the<00:02:39.230> hardest<00:02:39.560> part<00:02:39.830> by<00:02:40.550> far<00:02:40.820> I

00:02:41.940 --> 00:02:41.950 
and this is the hardest part by far I

00:02:41.950 --> 00:02:44.920 
and this is the hardest part by far I
usually<00:02:42.950> do<00:02:43.190> is<00:02:43.220> I<00:02:43.430> just<00:02:43.490> push<00:02:44.060> all<00:02:44.450> these

00:02:44.920 --> 00:02:44.930 
usually do is I just push all these

00:02:44.930 --> 00:02:46.900 
usually do is I just push all these
sides<00:02:45.380> together<00:02:45.680> then<00:02:46.160> stick<00:02:46.430> my<00:02:46.460> thumb<00:02:46.580> in

00:02:46.900 --> 00:02:46.910 
sides together then stick my thumb in

00:02:46.910 --> 00:02:49.810 
sides together then stick my thumb in
the<00:02:46.970> middle<00:02:47.470> and<00:02:48.470> then<00:02:48.650> just<00:02:49.100> kind<00:02:49.280> of<00:02:49.370> grab<00:02:49.640> it

00:02:49.810 --> 00:02:49.820 
the middle and then just kind of grab it

00:02:49.820 --> 00:02:53.380 
the middle and then just kind of grab it
like<00:02:49.940> that<00:02:50.150> start<00:02:50.660> twisting<00:02:52.090> looks<00:02:53.090> really

00:02:53.380 --> 00:02:53.390 
like that start twisting looks really

00:02:53.390 --> 00:02:56.500 
like that start twisting looks really
well<00:02:54.190> then<00:02:55.190> you<00:02:55.310> just<00:02:55.340> push<00:02:55.790> all<00:02:56.000> these<00:02:56.210> sides

00:02:56.500 --> 00:02:56.510 
well then you just push all these sides

00:02:56.510 --> 00:03:04.360 
well then you just push all these sides
down<00:02:57.970> on<00:03:01.510> this<00:03:02.510> and<00:03:03.440> then<00:03:03.590> I<00:03:03.620> usually<00:03:04.010> take

00:03:04.360 --> 00:03:04.370 
down on this and then I usually take

00:03:04.370 --> 00:03:10.510 
down on this and then I usually take
this<00:03:05.180> like<00:03:05.720> that<00:03:06.820> that<00:03:07.820> and<00:03:08.540> I<00:03:08.830> twist<00:03:09.830> it<00:03:10.040> just

00:03:10.510 --> 00:03:10.520 
this like that that and I twist it just

00:03:10.520 --> 00:03:20.560 
this like that that and I twist it just
tighten<00:03:10.700> it<00:03:10.940> up<00:03:12.250> and<00:03:13.250> then<00:03:13.400> there<00:03:13.820> you<00:03:13.910> go<00:03:19.570> and

00:03:20.560 --> 00:03:20.570 
tighten it up and then there you go and

00:03:20.570 --> 00:03:28.410
