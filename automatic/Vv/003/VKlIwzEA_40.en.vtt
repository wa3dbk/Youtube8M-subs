off<00:00:41.790> but<00:00:42.480> it<00:00:42.600> seems<00:00:42.780> like<00:00:42.890> we<00:00:43.890> can<00:00:44.040> see<00:00:44.280> kind<00:00:44.520> of

00:02:24.890 --> 00:02:24.900 
the filters of course they want to make

00:02:24.900 --> 00:02:26.600 
the filters of course they want to make
the<00:02:25.020> picture<00:02:25.200> look<00:02:25.320> better<00:02:25.770> but<00:02:26.130> I<00:02:26.190> just<00:02:26.460> want
