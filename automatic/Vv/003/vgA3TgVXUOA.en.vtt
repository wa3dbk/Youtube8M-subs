tear it off like that and then the key
with<00:00:20.510> this<00:00:20.660> is<00:00:20.720> we're<00:00:21.500> going<00:00:21.769> to<00:00:21.920> try<00:00:22.250> to

00:00:22.300 --> 00:00:22.310 
with this is we're going to try to

00:00:22.310 --> 00:00:25.089 
with this is we're going to try to
support<00:00:23.180> the<00:00:23.420> tip<00:00:23.660> upward<00:00:24.140> so<00:00:24.320> the<00:00:24.410> first<00:00:24.710> move

00:00:25.089 --> 00:00:25.099 
support the tip upward so the first move

little exposed I really want that tip
sealed<00:01:33.049> down<00:01:33.380> and<00:01:33.799> so<00:01:34.039> that<00:01:34.189> doesn't<00:01:34.429> scar<00:01:34.880> and

00:01:35.200 --> 00:01:35.210 
sealed down and so that doesn't scar and

00:01:35.210 --> 00:01:37.660 
sealed down and so that doesn't scar and
just<00:01:35.420> really<00:01:35.630> comes<00:01:35.899> down<00:01:36.020> naturally<00:01:36.770> and

00:01:37.660 --> 00:01:37.670 
just really comes down naturally and

00:01:37.670 --> 00:01:39.099 
just really comes down naturally and
really<00:01:37.909> cuts<00:01:38.119> down<00:01:38.179> the<00:01:38.359> swelling<00:01:38.569> much<00:01:38.869> more

00:01:58.209 --> 00:01:58.219 
little bit of pressure to sit it down

00:01:58.219 --> 00:01:59.919 
little bit of pressure to sit it down
and<00:01:58.520> we're<00:01:58.609> going<00:01:58.700> to<00:01:58.759> go<00:01:58.999> and<00:01:59.299> just<00:01:59.749> for<00:01:59.869> the

00:02:01.480 --> 00:02:01.490 
sake of completeness go ahead and just

00:02:01.490 --> 00:02:02.919 
sake of completeness go ahead and just
do<00:02:01.609> the<00:02:01.700> taping<00:02:02.060> all<00:02:02.179> the<00:02:02.299> way<00:02:02.389> to<00:02:02.450> the<00:02:02.600> top<00:02:02.840> of

00:02:02.919 --> 00:02:02.929 
do the taping all the way to the top of

00:02:02.929 --> 00:02:05.980 
do the taping all the way to the top of
the<00:02:03.020> bridge<00:02:03.229> so<00:02:03.829> again<00:02:04.069> tearing<00:02:04.429> it<00:02:04.609> off<00:02:04.990> three

00:02:05.980 --> 00:02:05.990 
the bridge so again tearing it off three

00:02:05.990 --> 00:02:07.690 
the bridge so again tearing it off three
finger<00:02:06.289> breaths<00:02:06.530> or<00:02:06.770> whatever<00:02:07.130> you<00:02:07.280> want<00:02:07.520> and

00:02:07.690 --> 00:02:07.700 
finger breaths or whatever you want and

00:02:07.700 --> 00:02:10.150 
finger breaths or whatever you want and
then<00:02:08.209> just<00:02:08.270> gently<00:02:08.869> pushing<00:02:09.649> down<00:02:09.830> a<00:02:09.860> little

00:02:10.150 --> 00:02:10.160 
then just gently pushing down a little

00:02:10.160 --> 00:02:11.830 
then just gently pushing down a little
bit<00:02:10.340> so<00:02:10.880> that<00:02:11.060> we<00:02:11.180> can<00:02:11.360> get<00:02:11.540> everything

00:02:11.830 --> 00:02:11.840 
bit so that we can get everything

00:02:11.840 --> 00:02:13.210 
bit so that we can get everything
covered<00:02:12.140> you<00:02:12.350> can<00:02:12.470> see<00:02:12.710> there<00:02:12.860> isn't<00:02:13.100> that

00:02:13.210 --> 00:02:13.220 
covered you can see there isn't that

00:02:13.220 --> 00:02:15.010 
covered you can see there isn't that
pinching<00:02:13.640> effect<00:02:13.940> all<00:02:14.150> you<00:02:14.570> got<00:02:14.720> to<00:02:14.810> do<00:02:14.900> is

00:02:15.010 --> 00:02:15.020 
pinching effect all you got to do is

00:02:15.020 --> 00:02:16.710 
pinching effect all you got to do is
sort<00:02:15.200> of<00:02:15.320> push<00:02:15.530> down<00:02:15.560> like<00:02:15.770> that

00:02:16.710 --> 00:02:16.720 
sort of push down like that

00:02:16.720 --> 00:02:18.810 
sort of push down like that
that's<00:02:16.840> how<00:02:16.960> to<00:02:17.020> tape<00:02:17.260> a<00:02:17.350> nose<00:02:17.530> now<00:02:17.740> the<00:02:18.670> way

00:02:18.810 --> 00:02:18.820 
that's how to tape a nose now the way

00:02:18.820 --> 00:02:20.790 
that's how to tape a nose now the way
that<00:02:19.000> the<00:02:19.450> time<00:02:19.690> that<00:02:19.720> you<00:02:20.020> tape<00:02:20.260> the<00:02:20.410> nose<00:02:20.590> is

00:02:20.790 --> 00:02:20.800 
that the time that you tape the nose is

00:02:20.800 --> 00:02:22.590 
that the time that you tape the nose is
after<00:02:21.520> taking<00:02:21.730> the<00:02:21.880> splint<00:02:22.150> down<00:02:22.330> take

00:02:22.590 --> 00:02:22.600 
after taking the splint down take

00:02:22.600 --> 00:02:24.390 
after taking the splint down take
everything<00:02:22.960> off<00:02:23.080> I<00:02:23.350> usually<00:02:23.590> ask<00:02:23.950> you<00:02:24.100> to<00:02:24.250> do

00:02:24.390 --> 00:02:24.400 
everything off I usually ask you to do

take<00:02:53.980> a<00:02:54.010> shower<00:02:54.310> and<00:02:54.520> because<00:02:54.880> it's<00:02:55.060> the<00:02:55.330> tape

00:02:55.680 --> 00:02:55.690 
take a shower and because it's the tape

00:02:55.690 --> 00:02:57.720 
take a shower and because it's the tape
is<00:02:55.870> really<00:02:56.080> not<00:02:56.170> held<00:02:56.410> on<00:02:56.560> too<00:02:56.740> well<00:02:56.950> it<00:02:57.580> will

00:02:57.720 --> 00:02:57.730 
is really not held on too well it will

00:02:57.730 --> 00:02:59.550 
is really not held on too well it will
basically<00:02:57.880> come<00:02:58.360> off<00:02:58.540> very<00:02:58.810> easily<00:02:59.020> just<00:02:59.500> with

00:02:59.550 --> 00:02:59.560 
basically come off very easily just with

00:02:59.560 --> 00:03:01.020 
basically come off very easily just with
a<00:02:59.680> shower<00:02:59.980> and<00:03:00.370> then<00:03:00.430> you<00:03:00.520> just<00:03:00.760> do<00:03:00.850> that<00:03:00.970> every

00:03:01.020 --> 00:03:01.030 
a shower and then you just do that every

00:03:01.030 --> 00:03:02.880 
a shower and then you just do that every
night<00:03:01.330> for<00:03:01.900> the<00:03:02.020> first<00:03:02.170> six<00:03:02.470> weeks<00:03:02.560> to<00:03:02.830> two

00:03:02.880 --> 00:03:02.890 
night for the first six weeks to two

00:03:02.890 --> 00:03:04.470 
night for the first six weeks to two
months<00:03:03.010> maybe<00:03:03.459> even<00:03:03.580> three<00:03:03.940> months<00:03:04.150> as<00:03:04.209> I<00:03:04.270> said

00:03:04.470 --> 00:03:04.480 
months maybe even three months as I said

00:03:04.480 --> 00:03:06.449 
months maybe even three months as I said
depending<00:03:04.630> on<00:03:04.959> what<00:03:05.110> I<00:03:05.140> see<00:03:05.380> with<00:03:05.560> you<00:03:05.740> and<00:03:05.980> the

00:03:06.449 --> 00:03:06.459 
depending on what I see with you and the

00:03:06.459 --> 00:03:07.500 
depending on what I see with you and the
other<00:03:06.580> thing<00:03:06.730> that's<00:03:06.850> really<00:03:07.000> important<00:03:07.420> with

00:03:07.500 --> 00:03:07.510 
other thing that's really important with

00:03:07.510 --> 00:03:09.720 
other thing that's really important with
those<00:03:07.660> two<00:03:07.900> is<00:03:08.170> that<00:03:08.680> when<00:03:08.860> you're<00:03:09.010> supine<00:03:09.700> or

00:03:09.720 --> 00:03:09.730 
those two is that when you're supine or

00:03:09.730 --> 00:03:11.760 
those two is that when you're supine or
lying<00:03:10.090> flat<00:03:10.420> there's<00:03:10.990> more<00:03:11.200> swelling<00:03:11.500> that

00:03:11.760 --> 00:03:11.770 
lying flat there's more swelling that

00:03:11.770 --> 00:03:13.650 
lying flat there's more swelling that
gets<00:03:11.920> into<00:03:12.160> your<00:03:12.280> nose<00:03:12.490> so<00:03:12.790> it<00:03:13.180> really<00:03:13.420> helps

00:03:13.650 --> 00:03:13.660 
gets into your nose so it really helps

00:03:13.660 --> 00:03:14.880 
gets into your nose so it really helps
you<00:03:13.750> especially<00:03:13.959> before<00:03:14.290> you<00:03:14.470> go<00:03:14.590> to<00:03:14.650> work

00:03:14.880 --> 00:03:14.890 
you especially before you go to work

00:03:14.890 --> 00:03:16.740 
you especially before you go to work
that's<00:03:15.190> not<00:03:15.400> much<00:03:15.580> swelling<00:03:16.000> so<00:03:16.360> if<00:03:16.480> you<00:03:16.570> tape

00:03:16.740 --> 00:03:16.750 
that's not much swelling so if you tape

00:03:16.750 --> 00:03:18.180 
that's not much swelling so if you tape
it<00:03:16.870> down<00:03:17.020> when<00:03:17.230> you're<00:03:17.350> flying<00:03:17.620> flat<00:03:18.040> the

00:03:18.180 --> 00:03:18.190 
it down when you're flying flat the

00:03:18.190 --> 00:03:19.800 
it down when you're flying flat the
swelling<00:03:18.550> can't<00:03:18.760> get<00:03:18.940> into<00:03:19.330> the<00:03:19.420> nose<00:03:19.570> and

00:03:19.800 --> 00:03:19.810 
swelling can't get into the nose and

00:03:19.810 --> 00:03:21.540 
swelling can't get into the nose and
therefore<00:03:20.590> the<00:03:20.709> nose<00:03:20.890> doesn't<00:03:21.130> get<00:03:21.340> more

00:03:21.540 --> 00:03:21.550 
therefore the nose doesn't get more

00:03:21.550 --> 00:03:23.130 
therefore the nose doesn't get more
swollen<00:03:21.790> there<00:03:22.090> isn't<00:03:22.269> that<00:03:22.360> variability<00:03:22.840> of

00:03:23.130 --> 00:03:23.140 
swollen there isn't that variability of

00:03:23.140 --> 00:03:25.320 
swollen there isn't that variability of
swelling<00:03:23.440> so<00:03:24.100> hopefully<00:03:24.370> that<00:03:24.519> little<00:03:24.670> short

00:03:25.320 --> 00:03:25.330 
swelling so hopefully that little short

00:03:25.330 --> 00:03:27.540 
swelling so hopefully that little short
video<00:03:25.510> will<00:03:25.840> give<00:03:25.959> you<00:03:26.080> an<00:03:26.200> idea<00:03:26.290> of<00:03:26.800> how<00:03:27.519> to

00:03:27.540 --> 00:03:27.550 
video will give you an idea of how to

00:03:27.550 --> 00:03:30.120 
video will give you an idea of how to
manage<00:03:28.019> taping<00:03:29.019> your<00:03:29.110> nose<00:03:29.320> afterwards<00:03:29.950> and

00:03:30.120 --> 00:03:30.130 
manage taping your nose afterwards and

00:03:30.130 --> 00:03:32.220 
manage taping your nose afterwards and
