00:00:21.109 --> 00:00:25.650
 when we found victoria poured 

00:00:23.609 --> 00:00:26.910
 the girls were in terrible condition 

00:00:25.650 --> 00:00:29.670
 parents died 

00:00:26.910 --> 00:00:31.080

00:00:29.670 --> 00:00:33.690

00:00:31.080 --> 00:00:37.769
 how they managed to survive remains a mystery 

00:00:33.690 --> 00:00:39.809
 and do your daddy's brother remember uncle hatch i 

00:00:37.769 --> 00:00:41.760
 I assume that in a warm family circle 

00:00:39.809 --> 00:00:42.330
 they can become normal again 

00:00:41.760 --> 00:00:45.440

00:01:10.210 --> 00:01:19.180

00:01:53.479 --> 00:02:01.570
 ghost this taste then experienced suffering 

00:01:58.420 --> 00:02:04.600
