makes it a whole lot easier and a lot
more<00:01:39.299> stable<00:01:39.689> because<00:01:40.530> it's<00:01:40.860> flat

00:01:42.330 --> 00:01:42.340 
more stable because it's flat

00:01:42.340 --> 00:01:45.450 
more stable because it's flat
and<00:01:43.119> same<00:01:43.359> with<00:01:43.390> the<00:01:43.570> trucks<00:01:43.869> the<00:01:44.770> axle<00:01:45.250> is

00:01:45.450 --> 00:01:45.460 
and same with the trucks the axle is

00:01:45.460 --> 00:01:47.249 
and same with the trucks the axle is
even<00:01:45.820> with<00:01:46.060> the<00:01:46.270> edge<00:01:46.390> of<00:01:46.509> the<00:01:46.600> board<00:01:46.810> so<00:01:47.229> I

00:01:47.249 --> 00:01:47.259 
even with the edge of the board so I

00:01:47.259 --> 00:01:48.719 
even with the edge of the board so I
have<00:01:47.380> to<00:01:47.469> figure<00:01:47.619> out<00:01:47.770> what<00:01:47.950> size<00:01:48.130> board<00:01:48.460> you

00:01:48.719 --> 00:01:48.729

00:02:06.809 --> 00:02:06.819 
edge of the rail you automatically go

00:02:06.819 --> 00:02:08.969 
edge of the rail you automatically go
back<00:02:07.000> so<00:02:07.390> like<00:02:08.080> just<00:02:08.170> making<00:02:08.470> sure<00:02:08.619> your<00:02:08.769> body

00:02:10.800 --> 00:02:10.810 
is more forward over your board to where

00:02:10.810 --> 00:02:12.150 
is more forward over your board to where
you<00:02:11.049> know<00:02:11.170> you've<00:02:11.290> got<00:02:11.319> four<00:02:11.709> words<00:02:11.890> a<00:02:11.980> little

00:02:56.190 --> 00:02:56.200 
kind of balance and then you'll flip

00:02:56.200 --> 00:02:58.470 
kind of balance and then you'll flip
over<00:02:56.560> again<00:02:56.920> we're<00:02:57.670> ladies<00:02:57.880> way<00:02:58.120> to<00:02:58.180> start

over again we're ladies way to start
with<00:02:58.569> that<00:02:58.660> is<00:02:58.810> just<00:02:58.959> get<00:02:59.109> to<00:02:59.200> the<00:02:59.290> back<00:02:59.440> the

00:02:59.729 --> 00:02:59.739 
with that is just get to the back the

00:02:59.739 --> 00:03:01.830 
with that is just get to the back the
balance<00:02:59.920> so<00:03:00.459> um<00:03:00.700> so<00:03:01.000> just<00:03:01.209> kind<00:03:01.329> of<00:03:01.450> hold<00:03:01.630> on

00:03:01.830 --> 00:03:01.840 
balance so um so just kind of hold on

00:03:01.840 --> 00:03:06.000 
balance so um so just kind of hold on
standing<00:03:02.459> and<00:03:03.459> then<00:03:03.609> hold<00:03:03.849> and<00:03:04.269> flip<00:03:05.139> it<00:03:05.500> just

00:03:06.000 --> 00:03:06.010 
standing and then hold and flip it just
