00:00:04.779 --> 00:00:09.530
 it's not my biggest hobby and 

00:00:08.059 --> 00:00:11.840
 it's a shame if you are on vacation 

00:00:09.530 --> 00:00:14.990
 're also needs to be done 

00:00:11.840 --> 00:00:17.660
 there must also be cleaned I am 

00:00:14.990 --> 00:00:21.020
 not the kind of person who vacuums every day 

00:00:17.660 --> 00:00:22.880
 really not nonsense but with a tent true 

00:00:21.020 --> 00:00:25.490
 vision children's feet go through and 

00:00:22.880 --> 00:00:28.840
 earth and insects 

00:00:25.490 --> 00:00:28.840
 you still come to keep that floor clean 

00:00:28.880 --> 00:00:34.519
 what is ideal for one there 

00:00:31.760 --> 00:00:36.710
 old-fashioned tempeh you might think 

00:00:34.519 --> 00:00:37.850
 dust and dustpan is just as good 

00:00:36.710 --> 00:00:41.840
 that is not the case 

00:00:37.850 --> 00:00:42.980
 a dustpan is first and foremost very soft 

00:00:41.840 --> 00:00:44.989
 so you don't go through that well 

00:00:42.980 --> 00:00:48.170
 he carpet you or that woolen blanket 

00:00:44.989 --> 00:00:51.079
 lying on the floor and pace makes sense 

00:00:48.170 --> 00:00:53.180
 that we who is made of reeds and that 

00:00:51.079 --> 00:00:56.660
 can handle anything 

00:00:53.180 --> 00:00:58.370
 2nd advantage he is very tall 

00:00:56.660 --> 00:01:00.170
 we dust and can because your whole tent 

00:00:58.370 --> 00:01:02.510
 to take part but lie on your knees 

00:01:00.170 --> 00:01:04.909
 holland you have to put all your kids in the tent 

00:01:02.510 --> 00:01:08.779
 broom yes you have to succeed but it is 

00:01:04.909 --> 00:01:10.279
 a lot more comfortable and not whole 

00:01:08.779 --> 00:01:12.139
 unimportant 

00:01:10.279 --> 00:01:14.299
 look how cute he says so much 

00:01:12.139 --> 00:01:16.520
 more fun than a dustpan and can 

00:01:14.299 --> 00:01:20.689
 so that's why I go for my mini witches 

00:01:16.520 --> 00:01:23.289
 this one and why did it become so good me 

00:01:20.689 --> 00:01:23.289
 let's see 

00:01:24.990 --> 00:01:37.350
 look i can almost stand still 

00:01:30.869 --> 00:01:37.350
 I got everything away and also the rug 

00:01:42.159 --> 00:01:48.579
 I get into a conversation and east 

00:01:44.590 --> 00:01:51.520
 biggest trick ask everything in a box 

00:01:48.579 --> 00:01:56.520
 unzip your hairstyle and wipe it like that 

00:01:51.520 --> 00:02:00.159
 outside and really do this every day 

00:01:56.520 --> 00:02:04.379
 it is so little work and then you have 

00:02:00.159 --> 00:02:04.379
 at least no mud between your sleeping bag
