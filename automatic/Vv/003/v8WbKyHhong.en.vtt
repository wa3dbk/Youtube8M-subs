00:00:04.430 --> 00:00:08.490
 carefully in this video are present 

00:00:06.240 --> 00:00:10.080
 a lot of chinese screams i 

00:00:08.490 --> 00:00:12.240
 warned you 

00:00:10.080 --> 00:00:13.950
 hello everyone with you benders and today 

00:00:12.240 --> 00:00:16.289
 me a mod that will solve all your problems 

00:00:13.950 --> 00:00:17.970
 with cows minecraft but not really 

00:00:16.289 --> 00:00:20.340
 only meek with any hostile 

00:00:17.970 --> 00:00:23.100
 mobs and how to actually use 

00:00:20.340 --> 00:00:24.750
 today for the good or the evil thing 

00:00:23.100 --> 00:00:27.660
 that with today's fashion 

00:00:24.750 --> 00:00:29.550
 you will have two new types of strike very 

00:00:27.660 --> 00:00:31.529
 steep hitting such that even chuck noris 

00:00:29.550 --> 00:00:33.570
 envy and how exactly their 

00:00:31.529 --> 00:00:35.880
 use is very, very simple in 

00:00:33.570 --> 00:00:37.469
 The first first strike type is then a series. 

00:00:35.880 --> 00:00:39.750
 blows that surely someone 

00:00:37.469 --> 00:00:41.280
 looked at the Shaolin monks but so 

00:00:39.750 --> 00:00:43.170
 that's how it actually uses 

00:00:41.280 --> 00:00:45.920
 hold down the right mouse button and start 

00:00:43.170 --> 00:00:45.920
 but I 

00:00:50.760 --> 00:00:55.540
 it was not bad in fact here three 

00:00:53.830 --> 00:00:57.610
 cows killed with a single series of blows 

00:00:55.540 --> 00:00:59.410
 really very cool all this 

00:00:57.610 --> 00:01:01.270
 I personally liked it but for 

00:00:59.410 --> 00:01:04.240
 in order to use it i will tell you 

00:01:01.270 --> 00:01:06.550
 what you need is cold but not galt 

00:01:04.240 --> 00:01:08.620
 units of gold and without half at least 

00:01:06.550 --> 00:01:10.030
 not then if you have them you can 

00:01:08.620 --> 00:01:11.680
 use it if not 

00:01:10.030 --> 00:01:13.330
 tell me you can't use 

00:01:11.680 --> 00:01:15.640
 show you again so to speak 

00:01:13.330 --> 00:01:18.870
 fastening material push right 

00:01:15.640 --> 00:01:18.870
 mouse button and start 

00:01:22.310 --> 00:01:28.970
 my musin g yu and who will not be difficult 

00:01:26.930 --> 00:01:29.720
 translate how it translates what he 

00:01:28.970 --> 00:01:31.880
 now said 

00:01:29.720 --> 00:01:34.549
 and generally yes how copper is great 

00:01:31.880 --> 00:01:36.560
 way to quickly throw away your rage 

00:01:34.549 --> 00:01:38.840
 some kind of rage maycroft actually 

00:01:36.560 --> 00:01:40.100
 very cool done but beyond that with 

00:01:38.840 --> 00:01:43.810
 using this blow 

00:01:40.100 --> 00:01:43.810
 you can also break blocks quickly 

00:01:48.100 --> 00:01:53.030
 just as well be able to quickly break 

00:01:50.329 --> 00:01:54.530
 cobblestone but everything except the apse on it on 

00:01:53.030 --> 00:01:56.690
 may actually be useful for example 

00:01:54.530 --> 00:01:59.149
 you can quickly get diamonds if u 

00:01:56.690 --> 00:02:01.159
 You do not have well, such as iron pickaxes also 

00:01:59.149 --> 00:02:03.409
 you can quickly finish to get iron 

00:02:01.159 --> 00:02:06.500
 anything but obsidian unfortunately not 

00:02:03.409 --> 00:02:07.819
 there is another type of strike is dragon strike 

00:02:06.500 --> 00:02:10.849
 I at least do n't call him that 

00:02:07.819 --> 00:02:12.980
 the law is exactly what is called a strike 

00:02:10.849 --> 00:02:14.660
 well or in a jump move to can on 

00:02:12.980 --> 00:02:18.290
 actually run off jumping it 

00:02:14.660 --> 00:02:22.040
 and he was not bad, that is, he firstly 

00:02:18.290 --> 00:02:26.120
 sunburn flies off somewhere in the sky usually 

00:02:22.040 --> 00:02:28.850
 somehow in that direction that is for a year ago 

00:02:26.120 --> 00:02:31.130
 fly up can fly the same 

00:02:28.850 --> 00:02:34.100
 blow very cool actually looks 

00:02:31.130 --> 00:02:37.549
 cool i'm super but there is one small 

00:02:34.100 --> 00:02:40.160
 the problem is three blows without creativity 

00:02:37.549 --> 00:02:42.319
 mode and what will you spend your voice 

00:02:40.160 --> 00:02:43.640
 why do I need to be honest I donâ€™t know 

00:02:42.319 --> 00:02:46.760

00:02:43.640 --> 00:02:48.799
 cool cow let really like 

00:02:46.760 --> 00:02:51.319
 option and also as you see meat the same 

00:02:48.799 --> 00:02:53.000
 fried arrives to you honestly 

00:02:51.319 --> 00:02:57.019
