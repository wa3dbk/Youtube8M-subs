they're even eating s'mores up in that

00:02:16.860 --> 00:02:21.080 
they're even eating s'mores up in that
tent<00:02:17.160> anyways<00:02:18.030> I<00:02:18.450> do<00:02:19.370> want<00:02:20.370> to<00:02:20.489> say<00:02:20.670> that<00:02:20.700> I'd

00:02:21.080 --> 00:02:21.090 
tent anyways I do want to say that I'd

00:02:21.090 --> 00:02:28.570 
tent anyways I do want to say that I'd
rate<00:02:21.620> this<00:02:22.620> map<00:02:23.239> huh<00:02:24.620> probably<00:02:26.000> five<00:02:27.000> or<00:02:27.450> four

00:02:28.570 --> 00:02:28.580 
rate this map huh probably five or four

00:02:28.580 --> 00:02:32.240 
rate this map huh probably five or four
out<00:02:29.580> of<00:02:29.820> 10<00:02:30.060> because<00:02:30.780> I<00:02:31.320> just<00:02:31.710> think<00:02:31.920> this<00:02:32.040> map

00:02:32.240 --> 00:02:32.250 
out of 10 because I just think this map

00:02:32.250 --> 00:02:35.000 
out of 10 because I just think this map
is<00:02:32.280> way<00:02:32.790> too<00:02:32.850> big<00:02:33.260> especially<00:02:34.260> for<00:02:34.920> an

00:02:35.000 --> 00:02:35.010 
is way too big especially for an

00:02:35.010 --> 00:02:37.490 
is way too big especially for an
uncharted<00:02:35.460> game<00:02:35.670> like<00:02:36.150> 10<00:02:36.510> players<00:02:36.870> on<00:02:37.170> such<00:02:37.470> a

00:02:37.490 --> 00:02:37.500 
uncharted game like 10 players on such a

00:02:37.500 --> 00:02:42.410 
uncharted game like 10 players on such a
big<00:02:37.920> map<00:02:38.190> I<00:02:38.490> think<00:02:39.270> that<00:02:40.010> this<00:02:41.010> map<00:02:41.370> for<00:02:42.240> this

00:02:42.410 --> 00:02:42.420 
big map I think that this map for this

00:02:42.420 --> 00:02:44.270 
big map I think that this map for this
particular<00:02:42.930> map<00:02:43.140> that<00:02:43.290> would<00:02:43.410> probably<00:02:43.740> they

00:02:44.270 --> 00:02:44.280 
particular map that would probably they

00:02:44.280 --> 00:02:48.080 
particular map that would probably they
should<00:02:44.610> probably<00:02:45.060> extend<00:02:45.360> it<00:02:45.480> to<00:02:45.630> 10v<00:02:46.310> 10<00:02:47.310> yes

00:02:48.080 --> 00:02:48.090 
should probably extend it to 10v 10 yes

00:02:48.090 --> 00:02:50.660 
should probably extend it to 10v 10 yes
I<00:02:48.330> do<00:02:48.450> believe<00:02:48.900> that<00:02:49.140> there<00:02:49.800> would<00:02:49.980> be<00:02:50.010> enough

00:02:50.660 --> 00:02:50.670 
I do believe that there would be enough

00:02:50.670 --> 00:02:52.940 
I do believe that there would be enough
space<00:02:50.940> for<00:02:51.120> everyone<00:02:51.330> to<00:02:51.570> go<00:02:51.720> around<00:02:51.960> instead

00:02:52.940 --> 00:02:52.950 
space for everyone to go around instead

00:02:52.950 --> 00:02:55.040 
space for everyone to go around instead
of<00:02:53.010> you<00:02:53.370> know<00:02:53.400> five<00:02:54.000> versus<00:02:54.420> five<00:02:54.450> but<00:02:54.900> that's

00:02:55.040 --> 00:02:55.050 
of you know five versus five but that's

00:02:55.050 --> 00:02:56.690 
of you know five versus five but that's
just<00:02:55.170> my<00:02:55.380> opinion<00:02:55.410> I<00:02:55.920> want<00:02:56.100> to<00:02:56.160> know<00:02:56.280> what<00:02:56.490> you

00:02:56.690 --> 00:02:56.700 
just my opinion I want to know what you

00:02:56.700 --> 00:03:01.090 
just my opinion I want to know what you
guys<00:02:56.730> think<00:02:57.120> about<00:02:57.270> this<00:02:57.570> map<00:02:57.900> Oh<00:02:58.200> be<00:02:59.070> so<00:02:59.610> uh

00:03:01.090 --> 00:03:01.100 
guys think about this map Oh be so uh

00:03:01.100 --> 00:03:05.000 
guys think about this map Oh be so uh
what<00:03:02.100> you<00:03:02.250> just<00:03:02.550> heard<00:03:02.760> was<00:03:02.820> my<00:03:03.750> reaction<00:03:04.080> live

00:03:05.000 --> 00:03:05.010 
what you just heard was my reaction live

00:03:05.010 --> 00:03:07.670 
what you just heard was my reaction live
reaction<00:03:05.670> when<00:03:05.970> I<00:03:06.210> got<00:03:06.600> that<00:03:06.630> kill<00:03:06.900> I<00:03:06.990> was<00:03:07.290> not

00:03:07.670 --> 00:03:07.680 
reaction when I got that kill I was not

00:03:07.680 --> 00:03:09.650 
reaction when I got that kill I was not
expecting<00:03:08.160> that<00:03:08.550> what<00:03:08.910> were<00:03:09.060> the<00:03:09.270> odds<00:03:09.390> that

00:03:09.650 --> 00:03:09.660 
expecting that what were the odds that

00:03:09.660 --> 00:03:11.930 
expecting that what were the odds that
just<00:03:10.290> randomly<00:03:10.620> chucking<00:03:11.100> that<00:03:11.280> grenade

00:03:11.930 --> 00:03:11.940 
just randomly chucking that grenade

00:03:11.940 --> 00:03:13.850 
just randomly chucking that grenade
would<00:03:12.180> actually<00:03:12.630> hit<00:03:12.780> somebody<00:03:13.170> but<00:03:13.440> as<00:03:13.530> I<00:03:13.560> was

00:03:13.850 --> 00:03:13.860 
would actually hit somebody but as I was

00:03:13.860 --> 00:03:16.700 
would actually hit somebody but as I was
saying<00:03:14.160> this<00:03:14.670> map<00:03:14.970> is<00:03:15.150> big<00:03:15.630> you<00:03:16.020> spend<00:03:16.320> most<00:03:16.470> of

00:03:16.700 --> 00:03:16.710 
saying this map is big you spend most of

00:03:16.710 --> 00:03:18.860 
saying this map is big you spend most of
your<00:03:16.800> time<00:03:16.890> looking<00:03:17.670> for<00:03:17.940> somebody<00:03:18.150> than

00:03:18.860 --> 00:03:18.870 
your time looking for somebody than

00:03:18.870 --> 00:03:20.690 
your time looking for somebody than
actually<00:03:19.320> getting<00:03:19.350> to<00:03:19.890> some<00:03:20.100> action<00:03:20.520> and

00:03:20.690 --> 00:03:20.700 
actually getting to some action and

00:03:20.700 --> 00:03:22.880 
actually getting to some action and
that's<00:03:21.450> pretty<00:03:21.720> unfortunate<00:03:22.140> because<00:03:22.500> you

00:03:22.880 --> 00:03:22.890 
that's pretty unfortunate because you

00:03:22.890 --> 00:03:25.550 
that's pretty unfortunate because you
know<00:03:22.980> on<00:03:23.100> maps<00:03:23.340> such<00:03:23.520> as<00:03:23.730> shark<00:03:24.030> toe<00:03:24.270> or<00:03:24.750> even

00:03:25.550 --> 00:03:25.560 
know on maps such as shark toe or even

00:03:25.560 --> 00:03:28.370 
know on maps such as shark toe or even
the<00:03:26.100> maps<00:03:26.760> for<00:03:27.000> these<00:03:27.090> intros<00:03:27.600> like<00:03:27.870> airstrip

00:03:28.370 --> 00:03:28.380 
the maps for these intros like airstrip

00:03:28.380 --> 00:03:31.340 
the maps for these intros like airstrip
you<00:03:28.950> spend<00:03:29.250> you<00:03:29.790> know<00:03:29.820> a<00:03:29.940> lot<00:03:30.300> of<00:03:30.330> time<00:03:30.690> before

00:03:31.340 --> 00:03:31.350 
you spend you know a lot of time before

00:03:31.350 --> 00:03:32.830 
you spend you know a lot of time before
you<00:03:31.680> get<00:03:31.860> to<00:03:32.010> the<00:03:32.040> actual<00:03:32.400> destination

00:03:32.830 --> 00:03:32.840 
you get to the actual destination

00:03:32.840 --> 00:03:35.060 
you get to the actual destination
getting<00:03:33.840> some<00:03:34.020> kills<00:03:34.230> but<00:03:34.530> in<00:03:34.650> this<00:03:34.770> one<00:03:34.830> you

00:03:35.060 --> 00:03:35.070 
getting some kills but in this one you

00:03:35.070 --> 00:03:38.270 
getting some kills but in this one you
know<00:03:35.310> you're<00:03:35.520> spending<00:03:35.940> like<00:03:36.150> minutes<00:03:37.280> okay

00:03:38.270 --> 00:03:38.280 
know you're spending like minutes okay

00:03:38.280 --> 00:03:39.620 
know you're spending like minutes okay
that's<00:03:38.460> probably<00:03:38.640> exaggerating<00:03:39.420> but<00:03:39.540> you

00:03:39.620 --> 00:03:39.630 
that's probably exaggerating but you

00:03:39.630 --> 00:03:41.930 
that's probably exaggerating but you
spend<00:03:39.900> quite<00:03:40.110> a<00:03:40.170> few<00:03:40.670> seconds<00:03:41.670> you<00:03:41.760> know

00:03:41.930 --> 00:03:41.940 
spend quite a few seconds you know

00:03:41.940 --> 00:03:43.970 
spend quite a few seconds you know
looking<00:03:42.270> for<00:03:42.480> somebody<00:03:42.690> and<00:03:43.230> yeah<00:03:43.680> like<00:03:43.860> I

00:03:43.970 --> 00:03:43.980 
looking for somebody and yeah like I

00:03:43.980 --> 00:03:47.270 
looking for somebody and yeah like I
said<00:03:44.010> it's<00:03:44.310> just<00:03:44.550> a<00:03:44.670> two<00:03:45.510> big<00:03:45.840> map<00:03:46.110> and<00:03:46.440> this<00:03:47.160> is

00:03:47.270 --> 00:03:47.280 
said it's just a two big map and this is

00:03:47.280 --> 00:03:49.070 
said it's just a two big map and this is
going<00:03:47.400> to<00:03:47.490> kind<00:03:47.670> of<00:03:47.730> lead<00:03:47.940> into<00:03:48.270> the<00:03:48.720> next

00:03:49.070 --> 00:03:49.080 
going to kind of lead into the next

00:04:24.350 --> 00:04:24.360 
what I'm trying to do to climb up this

00:04:24.360 --> 00:04:26.150 
what I'm trying to do to climb up this
structure<00:04:24.840> I<00:04:25.020> thought<00:04:25.440> you<00:04:25.590> could<00:04:25.740> climb<00:04:25.920> up

00:04:26.150 --> 00:04:26.160 
structure I thought you could climb up

00:04:26.160 --> 00:04:27.980 
structure I thought you could climb up
all<00:04:26.310> the<00:04:26.400> way<00:04:26.490> to<00:04:26.550> the<00:04:26.760> top<00:04:26.790> and<00:04:27.210> it's<00:04:27.810> pretty

00:04:27.980 --> 00:04:27.990 
all the way to the top and it's pretty

00:04:27.990 --> 00:04:29.210 
all the way to the top and it's pretty
unfortunate<00:04:28.260> you<00:04:28.590> can<00:04:28.800> because<00:04:29.010> I<00:04:29.160> think

00:04:29.210 --> 00:04:29.220 
unfortunate you can because I think

00:04:29.220 --> 00:04:31.670 
unfortunate you can because I think
that'd<00:04:29.610> be<00:04:29.760> a<00:04:30.030> pretty<00:04:30.540> nice<00:04:30.870> vantage<00:04:31.380> point

00:04:31.670 --> 00:04:31.680 
that'd be a pretty nice vantage point

00:04:31.680 --> 00:04:35.090 
that'd be a pretty nice vantage point
but<00:04:31.950> unfortunately<00:04:32.760> you<00:04:32.880> can<00:04:33.120> so<00:04:33.800> back<00:04:34.800> to<00:04:35.010> the

00:04:35.090 --> 00:04:35.100 
but unfortunately you can so back to the

my thoughts on

00:04:41.650 --> 00:04:45.300 
my thoughts on
what<00:04:41.770> they<00:04:42.430> could<00:04:42.639> do<00:04:42.910> to<00:04:44.040> multiplayer<00:04:45.040> that

00:04:45.300 --> 00:04:45.310 
what they could do to multiplayer that

00:04:45.310 --> 00:04:46.680 
what they could do to multiplayer that
would<00:04:45.430> make<00:04:45.639> it<00:04:45.669> a<00:04:45.970> little<00:04:46.120> bit<00:04:46.300> better<00:04:46.419> and

00:04:46.680 --> 00:04:46.690 
would make it a little bit better and

00:04:46.690 --> 00:04:49.590 
would make it a little bit better and
more<00:04:46.870> enjoyable<00:04:47.490> first<00:04:48.490> of<00:04:48.699> all<00:04:48.820> I<00:04:49.120> think<00:04:49.240> they

00:04:49.590 --> 00:04:49.600 
more enjoyable first of all I think they

00:04:49.600 --> 00:04:53.850 
more enjoyable first of all I think they
should<00:04:49.840> add<00:04:50.220> new<00:04:51.220> guns<00:04:51.520> yes<00:04:52.210> new<00:04:52.660> guns<00:04:53.410> because

00:04:53.850 --> 00:04:53.860 
should add new guns yes new guns because

00:04:53.860 --> 00:04:56.279 
should add new guns yes new guns because
out<00:04:54.759> about<00:04:55.060> you<00:04:55.240> guys<00:04:55.449> but<00:04:55.750> I'm<00:04:55.990> getting<00:04:56.229> a

00:04:56.279 --> 00:04:56.289 
out about you guys but I'm getting a

00:04:56.289 --> 00:04:58.080 
out about you guys but I'm getting a
little<00:04:56.350> bit<00:04:56.560> tired<00:04:56.800> of<00:04:57.100> using<00:04:57.430> the<00:04:57.699> same<00:04:57.940> you

00:04:58.080 --> 00:04:58.090 
little bit tired of using the same you

00:04:58.090 --> 00:05:01.110 
little bit tired of using the same you
know<00:04:58.120> AK<00:04:58.690> or<00:04:59.020> m9<00:04:59.410> or<00:04:59.650> gmail<00:05:00.009> I<00:05:00.190> love<00:05:00.639> those<00:05:00.759> guns

00:05:01.110 --> 00:05:01.120 
know AK or m9 or gmail I love those guns

00:05:01.120 --> 00:05:02.670 
know AK or m9 or gmail I love those guns
of<00:05:01.300> course<00:05:01.479> but<00:05:01.720> I<00:05:01.750> think<00:05:01.900> they<00:05:02.470> could

00:05:02.670 --> 00:05:02.680 
of course but I think they could

00:05:02.680 --> 00:05:05.370 
of course but I think they could
incorporate<00:05:02.949> different<00:05:04.050> weapons<00:05:05.050> and

00:05:05.370 --> 00:05:05.380 
incorporate different weapons and

00:05:05.380 --> 00:05:08.550 
incorporate different weapons and
multiplayer<00:05:06.009> cuz<00:05:07.000> even<00:05:07.389> in<00:05:07.810> the<00:05:08.110> campaign

00:05:08.550 --> 00:05:08.560 
multiplayer cuz even in the campaign

00:05:08.560 --> 00:05:11.210 
multiplayer cuz even in the campaign
there<00:05:09.340> is<00:05:09.520> guns<00:05:09.850> that<00:05:10.060> you<00:05:10.240> do<00:05:10.389> not<00:05:10.570> see<00:05:10.900> in

00:05:11.210 --> 00:05:11.220 
there is guns that you do not see in

00:05:11.220 --> 00:05:14.730 
there is guns that you do not see in
multiplayer<00:05:12.220> but<00:05:12.639> you<00:05:12.850> will<00:05:13.060> see<00:05:13.479> it<00:05:13.630> in<00:05:13.810> even

00:05:14.730 --> 00:05:14.740 
multiplayer but you will see it in even

00:05:14.740 --> 00:05:17.100 
multiplayer but you will see it in even
co-op<00:05:15.280> for<00:05:15.760> example<00:05:16.120> the<00:05:16.210> West's<00:05:16.630> which<00:05:16.900> I

00:05:17.100 --> 00:05:17.110 
co-op for example the West's which I

00:05:17.110 --> 00:05:20.040 
co-op for example the West's which I
know<00:05:17.169> would<00:05:17.470> be<00:05:17.500> a<00:05:17.860> cheesy<00:05:18.780> sidearm<00:05:19.780> because

00:05:20.040 --> 00:05:20.050 
know would be a cheesy sidearm because

00:05:20.050 --> 00:05:21.750 
know would be a cheesy sidearm because
it<00:05:20.199> would<00:05:20.320> be<00:05:20.470> way<00:05:20.740> too<00:05:20.770> overpowered<00:05:21.460> but<00:05:21.639> yeah

00:05:21.750 --> 00:05:21.760 
it would be way too overpowered but yeah

00:05:21.760 --> 00:05:23.490 
it would be way too overpowered but yeah
I<00:05:21.789> think<00:05:21.820> they<00:05:22.090> should<00:05:22.300> make<00:05:22.539> new<00:05:22.960> models<00:05:23.380> who

00:05:23.490 --> 00:05:23.500 
I think they should make new models who

00:05:23.500 --> 00:05:24.840 
I think they should make new models who
are<00:05:23.530> afford<00:05:23.979> or<00:05:24.280> maybe<00:05:24.460> they<00:05:24.669> should<00:05:24.820> just

00:05:24.840 --> 00:05:24.850 
are afford or maybe they should just

00:05:24.850 --> 00:05:26.939 
are afford or maybe they should just
wait<00:05:25.120> to<00:05:25.240> uncharted<00:05:25.600> 4<00:05:25.870> if<00:05:25.990> that's<00:05:26.169> something

00:05:26.939 --> 00:05:26.949 
wait to uncharted 4 if that's something

00:05:26.949 --> 00:05:29.129 
wait to uncharted 4 if that's something
that<00:05:27.100> you're<00:05:27.340> gonna<00:05:27.789> be<00:05:28.030> making<00:05:28.240> but<00:05:28.780> I<00:05:28.810> don't

00:05:29.129 --> 00:05:29.139 
that you're gonna be making but I don't

00:05:29.139 --> 00:05:30.540 
that you're gonna be making but I don't
know<00:05:29.229> that's<00:05:29.560> just<00:05:29.650> something<00:05:29.919> I<00:05:30.100> think<00:05:30.430> they

00:05:30.540 --> 00:05:30.550 
know that's just something I think they

00:05:30.550 --> 00:05:33.990 
know that's just something I think they
should<00:05:30.729> do<00:05:31.410> another<00:05:32.410> thing<00:05:32.860> I<00:05:33.190> think<00:05:33.820> they

00:05:33.990 --> 00:05:34.000 
should do another thing I think they

00:05:34.000 --> 00:05:37.230 
should do another thing I think they
should<00:05:34.180> add<00:05:34.360> would<00:05:35.020> be<00:05:35.610> additional<00:05:36.610> classes

00:05:37.230 --> 00:05:37.240 
should add would be additional classes

00:05:37.240 --> 00:05:41.460 
should add would be additional classes
because<00:05:38.400> kind<00:05:39.400> of<00:05:39.550> like<00:05:40.389> different<00:05:41.080> games<00:05:41.259> do

00:05:41.460 --> 00:05:41.470 
because kind of like different games do

00:05:41.470 --> 00:05:44.930 
because kind of like different games do
I<00:05:41.530> think<00:05:41.800> that<00:05:41.979> for<00:05:42.639> every<00:05:43.120> legacy<00:05:43.810> that<00:05:44.800> you

00:05:44.930 --> 00:05:44.940 
I think that for every legacy that you

00:05:44.940 --> 00:05:48.300 
I think that for every legacy that you
reach<00:05:45.940> they<00:05:46.419> should<00:05:46.660> add<00:05:46.900> another<00:05:47.500> class

00:05:48.300 --> 00:05:48.310 
reach they should add another class

00:05:48.310 --> 00:05:51.450 
reach they should add another class
setup<00:05:48.789> so<00:05:49.180> you<00:05:49.240> can<00:05:49.750> have<00:05:49.930> even<00:05:50.530> more<00:05:50.710> classy<00:05:51.190> I

00:05:51.450 --> 00:05:51.460 
setup so you can have even more classy I

00:05:51.460 --> 00:05:54.029 
setup so you can have even more classy I
think<00:05:51.699> there's<00:05:51.880> only<00:05:52.030> what<00:05:52.660> five<00:05:52.860> there's<00:05:53.860> a

00:05:54.029 --> 00:05:54.039 
think there's only what five there's a

00:05:54.039 --> 00:05:56.159 
think there's only what five there's a
five<00:05:54.430> available<00:05:55.240> slots<00:05:55.570> I'm<00:05:55.780> not<00:05:55.930> sure<00:05:56.050> it's

00:05:56.159 --> 00:05:56.169 
five available slots I'm not sure it's

00:05:56.169 --> 00:05:58.409 
five available slots I'm not sure it's
either<00:05:56.289> five<00:05:56.620> or<00:05:56.650> four<00:05:56.979> but<00:05:57.130> i<00:05:57.190> think<00:05:57.639> it<00:05:57.909> is

00:05:58.409 --> 00:05:58.419 
either five or four but i think it is

00:05:58.419 --> 00:06:01.350 
either five or four but i think it is
five<00:05:59.050> I<00:05:59.530> don't<00:06:00.039> know<00:06:00.130> how<00:06:00.340> I've<00:06:00.849> been<00:06:00.909> playing

00:06:01.350 --> 00:06:01.360 
five I don't know how I've been playing

00:06:01.360 --> 00:06:02.909 
five I don't know how I've been playing
this<00:06:01.510> game<00:06:01.599> for<00:06:01.720> so<00:06:01.990> long<00:06:02.139> I<00:06:02.199> don't<00:06:02.560> even<00:06:02.710> know

00:06:02.909 --> 00:06:02.919 
this game for so long I don't even know

00:06:02.919 --> 00:06:04.710 
this game for so long I don't even know
that<00:06:02.949> but<00:06:03.400> yeah<00:06:03.909> I<00:06:04.000> think<00:06:04.090> they<00:06:04.389> should<00:06:04.599> add

00:06:04.710 --> 00:06:04.720 
that but yeah I think they should add

00:06:04.720 --> 00:06:07.170 
that but yeah I think they should add
something<00:06:05.110> like<00:06:05.380> that<00:06:05.650> so<00:06:06.639> that<00:06:06.820> they<00:06:06.970> have

00:06:07.170 --> 00:06:07.180 
something like that so that they have

00:06:07.180 --> 00:06:11.159 
something like that so that they have
space<00:06:07.479> for<00:06:07.810> more<00:06:08.760> guns<00:06:09.760> in<00:06:10.180> your<00:06:10.510> classes<00:06:10.750> but

00:06:11.159 --> 00:06:11.169 
space for more guns in your classes but

00:06:11.169 --> 00:06:13.939 
space for more guns in your classes but
that<00:06:11.349> I<00:06:11.650> think<00:06:12.250> that<00:06:12.400> should<00:06:12.610> only<00:06:12.820> be

00:06:13.939 --> 00:06:13.949 
that I think that should only be

00:06:13.949 --> 00:06:16.920 
that I think that should only be
important<00:06:14.949> or<00:06:15.159> something<00:06:16.030> made<00:06:16.270> add<00:06:16.539> it<00:06:16.750> into

00:06:16.920 --> 00:06:16.930 
important or something made add it into

00:06:16.930 --> 00:06:19.110 
important or something made add it into
multiplayer<00:06:17.409> if<00:06:17.830> they<00:06:18.220> add<00:06:18.340> new<00:06:18.610> guns<00:06:18.880> because

00:06:19.110 --> 00:06:19.120 
multiplayer if they add new guns because

00:06:19.120 --> 00:06:20.550 
multiplayer if they add new guns because
if<00:06:19.360> they<00:06:19.539> don't<00:06:19.720> then<00:06:19.900> what's<00:06:20.139> the<00:06:20.260> point<00:06:20.409> you

00:06:20.550 --> 00:06:20.560 
if they don't then what's the point you

00:06:20.560 --> 00:06:23.250 
if they don't then what's the point you
know<00:06:20.680> because<00:06:20.919> you<00:06:21.159> basically<00:06:22.000> have<00:06:22.449> on<00:06:22.810> yeah

00:06:23.250 --> 00:06:23.260 
know because you basically have on yeah

00:06:23.260 --> 00:06:25.320 
know because you basically have on yeah
there<00:06:23.440> you<00:06:23.530> have<00:06:23.680> it<00:06:23.710> for<00:06:24.099> four<00:06:24.550> classes<00:06:25.060> sorry

00:06:25.320 --> 00:06:25.330 
there you have it for four classes sorry

00:06:25.330 --> 00:06:29.129 
there you have it for four classes sorry
not<00:06:25.780> five<00:06:26.020> this<00:06:26.260> for<00:06:27.000> loadouts<00:06:28.000> that<00:06:28.750> you<00:06:28.930> can

00:06:29.129 --> 00:06:29.139 
not five this for loadouts that you can

00:06:29.139 --> 00:06:32.820 
not five this for loadouts that you can
have<00:06:29.530> and<00:06:29.919> yeah<00:06:30.159> i<00:06:30.220> think<00:06:30.630> for<00:06:31.630> if<00:06:31.960> the<00:06:32.620> name

00:06:32.820 --> 00:06:32.830 
have and yeah i think for if the name

00:06:32.830 --> 00:06:34.439 
have and yeah i think for if the name
you<00:06:32.949> are<00:06:33.010> adding<00:06:33.430> in<00:06:33.520> more<00:06:33.550> guns<00:06:33.909> then<00:06:34.150> I<00:06:34.180> think

00:06:34.439 --> 00:06:34.449 
you are adding in more guns then I think

00:06:34.449 --> 00:06:36.870 
you are adding in more guns then I think
it's<00:06:34.599> okay<00:06:35.050> for<00:06:35.080> the<00:06:35.560> time<00:06:35.740> being<00:06:36.039> but<00:06:36.310> yeah

00:06:36.870 --> 00:06:36.880 
it's okay for the time being but yeah

00:06:36.880 --> 00:06:38.939 
it's okay for the time being but yeah
charted<00:06:37.449> for<00:06:37.690> if<00:06:37.840> that's<00:06:38.020> what<00:06:38.169> they're<00:06:38.320> going

00:06:38.939 --> 00:06:38.949 
charted for if that's what they're going

00:06:38.949 --> 00:06:40.500 
charted for if that's what they're going
to<00:06:39.099> be<00:06:39.190> doing<00:06:39.370> since<00:06:39.760> it's<00:06:39.909> not<00:06:40.000> announced<00:06:40.419> yet

00:06:40.500 --> 00:06:40.510 
to be doing since it's not announced yet

00:06:40.510 --> 00:06:42.540 
to be doing since it's not announced yet
then<00:06:40.840> maybe<00:06:41.349> they<00:06:41.560> should<00:06:41.770> look<00:06:42.010> into<00:06:42.250> doing

00:06:42.540 --> 00:06:42.550 
then maybe they should look into doing

00:06:42.550 --> 00:06:45.330 
then maybe they should look into doing
something<00:06:42.849> like<00:06:43.060> that<00:06:43.270> if<00:06:43.510> not<00:06:43.720> then<00:06:44.440> yeah

00:06:45.330 --> 00:06:45.340 
something like that if not then yeah

00:06:45.340 --> 00:06:49.439 
something like that if not then yeah
they<00:06:45.490> should<00:06:45.669> do<00:06:45.820> that<00:06:46.000> and<00:06:46.270> I<00:06:47.260> do<00:06:47.320> feel<00:06:48.130> a<00:06:48.520> last

00:06:49.439 --> 00:06:49.449 
they should do that and I do feel a last

00:06:49.449 --> 00:06:53.430 
they should do that and I do feel a last
if<00:06:49.930> it's<00:06:50.620> the<00:06:50.800> last<00:06:51.479> patch<00:06:52.479> coming<00:06:53.200> to

00:06:53.430 --> 00:06:53.440 
if it's the last patch coming to

00:06:53.440 --> 00:06:55.230 
if it's the last patch coming to
attorney<00:06:53.770> three<00:06:54.039> I<00:06:54.070> think<00:06:54.400> that's

00:06:55.230 --> 00:06:55.240 
attorney three I think that's

00:06:55.240 --> 00:06:57.870 
attorney three I think that's
might<00:06:55.419> be<00:06:55.750> what<00:06:56.229> they're<00:06:56.620> going<00:06:57.400> to<00:06:57.520> be<00:06:57.729> doing

00:06:57.870 --> 00:06:57.880 
might be what they're going to be doing

00:06:57.880 --> 00:06:59.670 
might be what they're going to be doing
for<00:06:58.150> the<00:06:58.270> two-year<00:06:58.539> anniversary<00:06:58.630> adding<00:06:59.530> this

00:06:59.670 --> 00:06:59.680

00:07:07.140 --> 00:07:07.150 
concluding if it's going to be the last

00:07:07.150 --> 00:07:08.610 
concluding if it's going to be the last
patch<00:07:07.389> of<00:07:07.569> course<00:07:07.780> I<00:07:07.990> can<00:07:08.169> I'm<00:07:08.259> not<00:07:08.380> saying

00:07:08.610 --> 00:07:08.620 
patch of course I can I'm not saying

00:07:08.620 --> 00:07:09.809 
patch of course I can I'm not saying
it's<00:07:08.740> going<00:07:08.889> to<00:07:08.949> be<00:07:09.039> the<00:07:09.130> last<00:07:09.250> one<00:07:09.400> but<00:07:09.669> I

00:07:09.809 --> 00:07:09.819 
it's going to be the last one but I

00:07:09.819 --> 00:07:11.879 
it's going to be the last one but I
think<00:07:10.210> it<00:07:10.330> might<00:07:10.509> be<00:07:10.539> another<00:07:11.349> patch<00:07:11.620> that

00:07:11.879 --> 00:07:11.889 
think it might be another patch that

00:07:11.889 --> 00:07:13.529 
think it might be another patch that
they're<00:07:12.069> going<00:07:12.220> to<00:07:12.460> put<00:07:13.000> into<00:07:13.240> multiplayer

00:07:13.529 --> 00:07:13.539
