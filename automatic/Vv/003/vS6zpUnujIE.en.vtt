slightly but I'll just explain your
technique<00:01:50.310> for<00:01:50.460> that<00:01:50.550> because<00:01:50.729> it<00:01:54.710> yeah<00:01:55.710> it

00:01:56.000 --> 00:01:56.010 
technique for that because it yeah it

00:01:56.010 --> 00:01:58.250 
technique for that because it yeah it
was<00:01:56.130> like<00:01:56.310> if<00:01:56.670> you<00:01:56.729> put<00:01:56.940> your<00:01:57.119> elbows<00:01:58.050> in<00:01:58.229> front

00:01:58.250 --> 00:01:58.260 
was like if you put your elbows in front

00:01:58.260 --> 00:02:00.290 
was like if you put your elbows in front
too<00:01:58.650> much<00:01:58.800> I<00:01:58.950> find<00:01:59.160> like<00:01:59.310> you<00:01:59.430> have<00:02:00.000> a<00:02:00.060> tendency

00:02:00.290 --> 00:02:00.300 
too much I find like you have a tendency

00:02:00.300 --> 00:02:03.230 
too much I find like you have a tendency
to<00:02:00.680> use<00:02:01.680> your<00:02:01.860> lower<00:02:02.040> back<00:02:02.250> to<00:02:02.520> they<00:02:03.119> have<00:02:03.210> a

00:02:03.230 --> 00:02:03.240 
to use your lower back to they have a

00:02:03.240 --> 00:02:05.270 
to use your lower back to they have a
loop<00:02:03.450> to<00:02:03.570> wait<00:02:03.750> this<00:02:04.530> one<00:02:04.590> is<00:02:04.800> bringing<00:02:04.950> it<00:02:05.220> a

00:02:05.270 --> 00:02:05.280 
loop to wait this one is bringing it a

00:02:05.280 --> 00:02:13.250 
loop to wait this one is bringing it a
little<00:02:05.490> bit<00:02:05.610> lower<00:02:06.479> right<00:02:12.260> contractions

00:02:13.250 --> 00:02:13.260 
little bit lower right contractions

00:02:13.260 --> 00:02:21.260 
little bit lower right contractions
right<00:02:13.350> the<00:02:13.590> second<00:02:13.980> second<00:02:14.600> right<00:02:19.430> I<00:02:20.430> use<00:02:21.060> that

00:02:21.260 --> 00:02:21.270 
right the second second right I use that

00:02:21.270 --> 00:02:24.080 
right the second second right I use that
technique<00:02:21.600> actually<00:02:21.959> for<00:02:22.200> hammer<00:02:22.800> curls<00:02:23.220> but

00:02:24.080 --> 00:02:24.090 
technique actually for hammer curls but

00:02:24.090 --> 00:02:26.120 
technique actually for hammer curls but
for<00:02:24.360> I'm<00:02:24.989> really<00:02:25.230> emphasized<00:02:25.860> it<00:02:26.040> with

00:02:26.120 --> 00:02:26.130 
for I'm really emphasized it with

00:02:26.130 --> 00:02:27.410
