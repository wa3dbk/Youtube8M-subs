00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.350
 he was gone where he confirms that he does 

00:00:02.460 --> 00:00:06.899
 a couple of weeks there is a 

00:00:04.350 --> 00:00:11.240
 Second chance with Julius Caesar 

00:00:06.899 --> 00:00:14.840
 Rodriguez if we decide to give it a 

00:00:11.240 --> 00:00:16.940
 a new opportunity 

00:00:14.840 --> 00:00:19.100
 a new opportunity because we want 

00:00:16.940 --> 00:00:20.650
 a lot and I find that what the 

00:00:19.100 --> 00:00:25.310
 things that happened 

00:00:20.650 --> 00:00:27.949
 this served to not serve much 

00:00:25.310 --> 00:00:29.930
 news that remerar farandulandia then 

00:00:27.949 --> 00:00:32.660
 nothing foreshadowed a reconciliation 

00:00:29.930 --> 00:00:34.940
 and is that last March the man who 

00:00:32.660 --> 00:00:36.980
 he did everything on television he had 

00:00:34.940 --> 00:00:39.100
 linked nothing less than with begoña 

00:00:36.980 --> 00:00:42.180
 basauri 

00:00:39.100 --> 00:00:46.460
 It's a friendship 

00:00:42.180 --> 00:00:48.110
 I think it's not as important as 

00:00:46.460 --> 00:00:49.940
 like so we read so much color 

00:00:48.110 --> 00:00:52.430
 we could confirm a romance a 

00:00:49.940 --> 00:00:53.660
 friendship we can not confirm a reverse 

00:00:52.430 --> 00:00:55.370
 we can confirm a romance not what 

00:00:53.660 --> 00:00:58.840
 we can deny neither can we deny 

00:00:55.370 --> 00:00:58.840
 lend a relationship with us 

00:01:02.710 --> 00:01:07.320
 we can confirm friendship or enmity 

00:01:04.670 --> 00:01:09.640
 nothing 

00:01:07.320 --> 00:01:13.540
 we are sorry we have things to see 

00:01:09.640 --> 00:01:17.080
 work has theater I am an actress 

00:01:13.540 --> 00:01:18.750
 we have friends in common story that is not 

00:01:17.080 --> 00:01:21.090
 nothing bad 

00:01:18.750 --> 00:01:23.700
 images that devastated the former club of 

00:01:21.090 --> 00:01:26.550
 the comedy 'well, pretty caramel 

00:01:23.700 --> 00:01:29.580
 You could see Begoña and Jotas and eating 

00:01:26.550 --> 00:01:32.940
 in a sushi restaurant I want 

00:01:29.580 --> 00:01:33.450
 ask yourself the photos of Begoña based 

00:01:32.940 --> 00:01:36.860
 United 

00:01:33.450 --> 00:01:36.860
 rodríguez that you think the same 

00:01:40.320 --> 00:01:46.740
 there are the photos we see that they are 

00:01:42.510 --> 00:01:49.130
 dining that you know about it had a 

00:01:46.740 --> 00:01:49.130
 friendship 

00:01:49.260 --> 00:01:55.550
 in particular because it 's okay 

00:01:51.990 --> 00:01:57.770
 It can also be what you want 

00:01:55.550 --> 00:01:58.830
 what will have happened with that relationship 

00:01:57.770 --> 00:02:00.990
 severe 

00:01:58.830 --> 00:02:03.930
 he played it for the love of July to see 

00:02:00.990 --> 00:02:05.700
 that had a new conquest 

00:02:03.930 --> 00:02:08.130
 I'm not going to tell you that I liked it very much 

00:02:05.700 --> 00:02:09.420
 but also I am super consistent of 

00:02:08.130 --> 00:02:11.370
 that in the minute that I left the 

00:02:09.420 --> 00:02:12.690
 home and I ended my relationship with july 

00:02:11.370 --> 00:02:14.580
 July was free to do what 

00:02:12.690 --> 00:02:18.150
 I would like as I was also 

00:02:14.580 --> 00:02:20.370
 single six seven months and went out and the 

00:02:18.150 --> 00:02:23.430
 it went well and all that then he 

00:02:20.370 --> 00:02:26.010
 he was also in his right to 

00:02:23.430 --> 00:02:30.540
 raja would be very expensive if I said go 

00:02:26.010 --> 00:02:32.340
 with me what happens if not no but it was super 

00:02:30.540 --> 00:02:36.090
 heavy for me because they were fed up 

00:02:32.340 --> 00:02:38.150
 things already after we finished I did not want 

00:02:36.090 --> 00:02:40.340
 know nothing 

00:02:38.150 --> 00:02:45.370
 but then with him with the months with the 

00:02:40.340 --> 00:02:48.600
 time I was realizing that 

00:02:45.370 --> 00:02:51.690
 that I loved him so much 

00:02:48.600 --> 00:02:53.290
 and maybe it was good as everything that happened 

00:02:51.690 --> 00:02:55.989
 In between 

00:02:53.290 --> 00:02:58.450
 July Cesar Rodriguez and Laura Prieto 

00:02:55.989 --> 00:03:00.640
 they give a new romance opportunity that 

00:02:58.450 --> 00:03:03.069
 live a second air after your media 

00:03:00.640 --> 00:03:05.799
 break will be this the reflection that love 

00:03:03.069 --> 00:03:09.540
 between both is stronger and that there will be 

00:03:05.799 --> 00:03:09.540
 happened with begoña basauri 

00:03:19.850 --> 00:03:24.280
 They have invited my spine 

00:03:21.920 --> 00:03:24.280
 yes 

00:03:29.900 --> 00:03:33.709
 being all the media today because 

00:03:31.909 --> 00:03:35.120
 there is no doubt that it existed 

00:03:33.709 --> 00:03:36.319
 in this time remember that the 

00:03:35.120 --> 00:03:38.599
 relationship between laura and julio soda 

00:03:36.319 --> 00:03:41.420
 ends there by November of the year 

00:03:38.599 --> 00:03:42.709
 2014 about what not and now the 

00:03:41.420 --> 00:03:45.079
 brit talks that they are coming back 

00:03:42.709 --> 00:03:47.120
 a few weeks in that time there's no 9 that 

00:03:45.079 --> 00:03:49.310
 there was a relationship between July are 

00:03:47.120 --> 00:03:51.439
 Rodriguez and based on a relationship that 

00:03:49.310 --> 00:03:52.879
 your friends with the apes right from the 

00:03:51.439 --> 00:03:54.680
 which began to have certain 

00:03:52.879 --> 00:03:55.819
 information on we even caught them the 

00:03:54.680 --> 00:03:58.220
 we were doing more than once 

00:03:55.819 --> 00:04:00.590
 what is happening because this ends 

00:03:58.220 --> 00:04:02.269
 relationship what I know is that although 

00:04:00.590 --> 00:04:04.329
 they are together they never put the 

00:04:02.269 --> 00:04:04.329
 first name 

00:04:04.910 --> 00:04:11.120
 I really like enjoying both begoña 

00:04:09.170 --> 00:04:13.460
 of life coming true a very relationship 

00:04:11.120 --> 00:04:15.740
 fleeting with Robert this master boy 

00:04:13.460 --> 00:04:17.780
 set with whom shares a mentions 

00:04:15.740 --> 00:04:19.489
 commercial today then I 

00:04:17.780 --> 00:04:22.040
 he had a great time together he never put 

00:04:19.489 --> 00:04:25.130
 the name of pololeo what happens in that 

00:04:22.040 --> 00:04:27.170
 way between having a good time I know that 

00:04:25.130 --> 00:04:29.270
 July always had the laurita of 

00:04:27.170 --> 00:04:32.750
 somehow he had it in the sense of 

00:04:29.270 --> 00:04:34.430
 that he knew not what they told me 

00:04:32.750 --> 00:04:36.200
 the July close was that while in 

00:04:34.430 --> 00:04:38.570
 last July very well with begoña he 

00:04:36.200 --> 00:04:40.630
 never lost hope to return with 

00:04:38.570 --> 00:04:42.190
 the skin 

00:04:40.630 --> 00:04:44.950
 and here apparently can help me 

00:04:42.190 --> 00:04:46.990
 you well and jaime alé is a kind 

00:04:44.950 --> 00:04:48.550
 of tactics very different from those used in 

00:04:46.990 --> 00:04:51.340
 the previous relations of July Caesar 

00:04:48.550 --> 00:04:53.680
 where he finished and started with another 

00:04:51.340 --> 00:04:55.420
 relationship here always shelter hope 

00:04:53.680 --> 00:04:58.240
 from seeing collaboration to it is a technique 

00:04:55.420 --> 00:05:00.430
 very different I am that we are and look there 

00:04:58.240 --> 00:05:04.060
 there first to me it seems to me that maybe 

00:05:00.430 --> 00:05:05.980
 I changed the modus operandi because 

00:05:04.060 --> 00:05:09.040
 it was the hour that ended with him and 

00:05:05.980 --> 00:05:10.540
 she says it very openly here as 

00:05:09.040 --> 00:05:12.310
 that makes it very clear she was the one 

00:05:10.540 --> 00:05:14.020
 he grabbed the suitcases and left the 

00:05:12.310 --> 00:05:16.540
 department from the house I shared 

00:05:14.020 --> 00:05:17.980
 in let's say then like that there are 

00:05:16.540 --> 00:05:20.200
 one thing that she made the decision 

00:05:17.980 --> 00:05:21.490
 so I also think that that 

00:05:20.200 --> 00:05:22.900
 placed a little bit what is not 

00:05:21.490 --> 00:05:24.730
 accustomed to women being the 

00:05:22.900 --> 00:05:26.890
 decide in his life but he will be 

00:05:24.730 --> 00:05:28.480
 who decides for her and on the other hand 

00:05:26.890 --> 00:05:30.940
 I also think it cost him a lot 

00:05:28.480 --> 00:05:33.160
 convince begoña that what he 

00:05:30.940 --> 00:05:35.920
 I really wanted to know I also knew that 

00:05:33.160 --> 00:05:37.660
 they had told me that it cost him 

00:05:35.920 --> 00:05:39.160
 much to convince begoña basauri that 

00:05:37.660 --> 00:05:41.110
 he wanted to have a serious relationship 

00:05:39.160 --> 00:05:43.240
 with her and apparently that's why we 

00:05:41.110 --> 00:05:46.360
 they came to realize much more now 

00:05:43.240 --> 00:05:48.430
 right now he says something interesting 

00:05:46.360 --> 00:05:52.120
 at the end the last wedge we saw him 

00:05:48.430 --> 00:05:54.430
 to say was it seems that everything that happened to me 

00:05:52.120 --> 00:05:57.330
 made me realize that I wanted it when 

00:05:54.430 --> 00:06:01.960
 things realizes that it needs 

00:05:57.330 --> 00:06:04.150
 human being I am bipolar many times 

00:06:01.960 --> 00:06:06.280
 t-shirts the hand with a friend i give 

00:06:04.150 --> 00:06:08.979
 with a friend eduardo de la vega of this 

00:06:06.280 --> 00:06:13.259
 I find that the aura is a very 

00:06:08.979 --> 00:06:13.259
 beautiful and I'm glad you reconcile 

00:06:14.139 --> 00:06:19.659
 see if he wanted to lower me a bit if I 

00:06:16.659 --> 00:06:22.349
 come on I said I love I love intruders 

00:06:19.659 --> 00:06:22.349
 I 

00:06:22.580 --> 00:06:27.949
 a little bit what finally comes out I know of 

00:06:26.569 --> 00:06:29.479
 what the formula does the work of these 

00:06:27.949 --> 00:06:31.050
 times that finally do not have to 

00:06:29.479 --> 00:06:34.210
 give 

00:06:31.050 --> 00:06:36.069
 things happen in between 

00:06:34.210 --> 00:06:38.050
 do they valued or you finally give 

00:06:36.069 --> 00:06:40.060
 mind that those things were not for you 

00:06:38.050 --> 00:06:41.710
 also happens I think that not only in 

00:06:40.060 --> 00:06:42.910
 thing of taste not enrolled that school 

00:06:41.710 --> 00:06:45.069
 is in love there is also nothing 

00:06:42.910 --> 00:06:48.669
 written is everything so is the 

00:06:45.069 --> 00:06:51.340
 fulminante de morante ready and I right now 

00:06:48.669 --> 00:06:53.590
 it's always a day one I saw her very 

00:06:51.340 --> 00:06:55.509
 true to this day that we see her 

00:06:53.590 --> 00:06:58.090
 with this with this video I do not feel 

00:06:55.509 --> 00:06:59.590
 melate because finally there but that 

00:06:58.090 --> 00:07:01.090
 I was always in love Julius Caesar 

00:06:59.590 --> 00:07:03.159
 never want 

00:07:01.090 --> 00:07:05.470
 this term since enchanting is never 

00:07:03.159 --> 00:07:07.479
 disappointed he never ran out of love I 

00:07:05.470 --> 00:07:09.909
 I think he wanted to be always present 

00:07:07.479 --> 00:07:13.710
 in the life of July even though it was 

00:07:09.909 --> 00:07:13.710
 another woman to me but there is a phrase
