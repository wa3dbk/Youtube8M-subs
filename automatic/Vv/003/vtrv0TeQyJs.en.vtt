00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:01.579 

today<00:00:00.599> we're<00:00:00.750> going<00:00:00.780> to<00:00:00.900> be<00:00:01.050> learning<00:00:01.230> about

00:00:01.579 --> 00:00:01.589 
today we're going to be learning about

00:00:01.589 --> 00:00:04.059 
today we're going to be learning about
photosynthesis<00:00:02.460> and<00:00:02.669> cellular<00:00:03.300> respiration

00:00:04.059 --> 00:00:04.069 
photosynthesis and cellular respiration

00:00:04.069 --> 00:00:06.530 
photosynthesis and cellular respiration
we<00:00:05.069> know<00:00:05.220> it<00:00:05.310> has<00:00:05.430> to<00:00:05.460> do<00:00:05.670> with<00:00:05.790> energy<00:00:06.150> we<00:00:06.390> know

00:00:06.530 --> 00:00:06.540 
we know it has to do with energy we know

00:00:06.540 --> 00:00:08.810 
we know it has to do with energy we know
it<00:00:06.750> has<00:00:07.220> photosynthesis<00:00:08.220> has<00:00:08.400> to<00:00:08.519> do<00:00:08.639> with

00:00:08.810 --> 00:00:08.820 
it has photosynthesis has to do with

00:00:08.820 --> 00:00:12.379 
it has photosynthesis has to do with
sunlight<00:00:09.660> water<00:00:10.309> you<00:00:11.309> know<00:00:11.460> and<00:00:11.700> carbon

00:00:12.379 --> 00:00:12.389 
sunlight water you know and carbon

00:00:12.389 --> 00:00:15.499 
sunlight water you know and carbon
dioxide<00:00:12.900> and<00:00:13.230> making<00:00:13.590> glucose<00:00:14.490> and<00:00:14.759> oxygen<00:00:15.030> or

00:00:15.499 --> 00:00:15.509 
dioxide and making glucose and oxygen or

00:00:15.509 --> 00:00:17.750 
dioxide and making glucose and oxygen or
other<00:00:15.719> carbohydrates<00:00:16.440> so<00:00:17.279> let's<00:00:17.430> take<00:00:17.520> a<00:00:17.580> look

00:00:17.750 --> 00:00:17.760 
other carbohydrates so let's take a look

00:00:17.760 --> 00:00:20.000 
other carbohydrates so let's take a look
at<00:00:17.850> that<00:00:17.970> process<00:00:18.410> we<00:00:19.410> first<00:00:19.680> need<00:00:19.830> to<00:00:19.859> know

00:00:20.000 --> 00:00:20.010 
at that process we first need to know

00:00:20.010 --> 00:00:23.480 
at that process we first need to know
what<00:00:20.189> ATP<00:00:20.789> is<00:00:20.939> so<00:00:21.480> what<00:00:21.630> is<00:00:21.750> ATP<00:00:22.050> ATP<00:00:22.800> is<00:00:23.220> called

00:00:23.480 --> 00:00:23.490 
what ATP is so what is ATP ATP is called

00:00:23.490 --> 00:00:27.050 
what ATP is so what is ATP ATP is called
adenosine<00:00:24.980> triphosphate<00:00:26.060> adenosine

00:00:27.050 --> 00:00:27.060 
adenosine triphosphate adenosine

00:00:27.060 --> 00:00:30.200 
adenosine triphosphate adenosine
triphosphate<00:00:27.900> again<00:00:28.289> it<00:00:28.500> has<00:00:29.039> these<00:00:29.369> three

00:00:30.200 --> 00:00:30.210 
triphosphate again it has these three

00:00:30.210 --> 00:00:32.930 
triphosphate again it has these three
parts<00:00:30.779> it<00:00:30.960> has<00:00:31.679> an<00:00:31.830> added<00:00:32.070> editing<00:00:32.730> group

00:00:32.930 --> 00:00:32.940 
parts it has an added editing group

00:00:32.940 --> 00:00:35.330 
parts it has an added editing group
which<00:00:33.329> is<00:00:33.510> made<00:00:33.719> up<00:00:33.809> of<00:00:33.899> nitrogen<00:00:34.140> parts<00:00:35.130> it

00:00:35.330 --> 00:00:35.340 
which is made up of nitrogen parts it

00:00:35.340 --> 00:00:38.869 
which is made up of nitrogen parts it
has<00:00:36.239> a<00:00:36.270> ribose<00:00:36.870> sugar<00:00:37.110> and<00:00:37.770> we've<00:00:38.670> learned

00:00:38.869 --> 00:00:38.879 
has a ribose sugar and we've learned

00:00:38.879 --> 00:00:40.459 
has a ribose sugar and we've learned
about<00:00:39.030> other<00:00:39.270> sugars<00:00:39.660> like<00:00:39.809> glucose<00:00:40.230> fructose

00:00:40.459 --> 00:00:40.469 
about other sugars like glucose fructose

00:00:40.469 --> 00:00:42.319 
about other sugars like glucose fructose
galactose<00:00:41.219> well<00:00:41.489> here's<00:00:41.670> another<00:00:41.730> one<00:00:42.090> called

00:00:42.319 --> 00:00:42.329 
galactose well here's another one called

00:00:42.329 --> 00:00:45.049 
galactose well here's another one called
ribose<00:00:42.690> which<00:00:43.440> is<00:00:43.530> very<00:00:43.739> important<00:00:44.190> actually

00:00:45.049 --> 00:00:45.059 
ribose which is very important actually

00:00:45.059 --> 00:00:48.979 
ribose which is very important actually
an<00:00:45.149> RNA<00:00:45.690> and<00:00:46.610> especially<00:00:47.610> here<00:00:48.090> in<00:00:48.120> making<00:00:48.629> ATP

00:00:48.979 --> 00:00:48.989 
an RNA and especially here in making ATP

00:00:48.989 --> 00:00:52.459 
an RNA and especially here in making ATP
and<00:00:49.760> we<00:00:50.760> have<00:00:50.910> three<00:00:51.149> phosphate<00:00:51.570> groups<00:00:51.600> that

00:00:52.459 --> 00:00:52.469 
and we have three phosphate groups that

00:00:52.469 --> 00:00:54.470 
and we have three phosphate groups that
have<00:00:52.710> a<00:00:52.739> lot<00:00:53.010> of<00:00:53.039> energy<00:00:53.309> and<00:00:53.640> the<00:00:54.270> more

00:00:54.470 --> 00:00:54.480 
have a lot of energy and the more

00:00:54.480 --> 00:00:56.990 
have a lot of energy and the more
phosphates<00:00:55.079> there<00:00:55.379> are<00:00:55.649> the<00:00:56.309> more<00:00:56.489> energetic

00:00:56.990 --> 00:00:57.000 
phosphates there are the more energetic

00:00:57.000 --> 00:00:59.990 
phosphates there are the more energetic
this<00:00:57.239> molecule<00:00:57.510> becomes<00:00:58.670> so<00:00:59.670> how<00:00:59.850> do<00:00:59.910> we

00:00:59.990 --> 00:01:00.000 
this molecule becomes so how do we

00:01:00.000 --> 00:01:01.819 
this molecule becomes so how do we
explain<00:01:00.329> it<00:01:00.539> well<00:01:00.690> the<00:01:00.870> way<00:01:00.989> I<00:01:01.020> explain<00:01:01.620> it<00:01:01.739> is

00:01:01.819 --> 00:01:01.829 
explain it well the way I explain it is

00:01:01.829 --> 00:01:06.920 
explain it well the way I explain it is
like<00:01:02.010> a<00:01:02.039> battery<00:01:02.520> so<00:01:03.329> ATP<00:01:04.199> is<00:01:04.680> like<00:01:05.040> a<00:01:05.930> medium

00:01:06.920 --> 00:01:06.930 
like a battery so ATP is like a medium

00:01:06.930 --> 00:01:10.160 
like a battery so ATP is like a medium
charged<00:01:07.439> battery<00:01:08.100> it<00:01:08.369> has<00:01:09.150> energy<00:01:09.659> but<00:01:09.930> not

00:01:10.160 --> 00:01:10.170 
charged battery it has energy but not

00:01:10.170 --> 00:01:13.070 
charged battery it has energy but not
that<00:01:10.380> much<00:01:10.680> so<00:01:11.189> again<00:01:11.400> ATP<00:01:11.970> is<00:01:12.000> adenosine<00:01:12.689> dye

00:01:13.070 --> 00:01:13.080 
that much so again ATP is adenosine dye

00:01:13.080 --> 00:01:16.070 
that much so again ATP is adenosine dye
which<00:01:13.770> means<00:01:14.070> to<00:01:14.360> adenosine<00:01:15.360> diphosphate<00:01:15.540> it

00:01:16.070 --> 00:01:16.080 
which means to adenosine diphosphate it

00:01:16.080 --> 00:01:18.560 
which means to adenosine diphosphate it
has<00:01:16.200> two<00:01:16.470> phosphates<00:01:17.040> and<00:01:17.189> has<00:01:17.939> some<00:01:18.180> energy

00:01:18.560 --> 00:01:18.570 
has two phosphates and has some energy

00:01:18.570 --> 00:01:20.420 
has two phosphates and has some energy
like<00:01:19.080> this<00:01:19.259> flashlight<00:01:19.530> can<00:01:19.920> light<00:01:20.100> but<00:01:20.310> not

00:01:20.420 --> 00:01:20.430 
like this flashlight can light but not

00:01:20.430 --> 00:01:22.310 
like this flashlight can light but not
that<00:01:20.640> much<00:01:20.850> but<00:01:21.540> by<00:01:21.720> adding<00:01:22.140> another

00:01:22.310 --> 00:01:22.320 
that much but by adding another

00:01:22.320 --> 00:01:25.539 
that much but by adding another
phosphate<00:01:22.619> look<00:01:23.130> what<00:01:23.250> happens<00:01:23.610> we<00:01:24.210> make<00:01:24.420> this

00:01:25.539 --> 00:01:25.549 
phosphate look what happens we make this

00:01:25.549 --> 00:01:29.420 
phosphate look what happens we make this
molecule<00:01:26.549> very<00:01:27.119> energetic<00:01:27.869> now<00:01:28.080> becomes<00:01:28.530> ATP

00:01:29.420 --> 00:01:29.430 
molecule very energetic now becomes ATP

00:01:29.430 --> 00:01:31.460 
molecule very energetic now becomes ATP
by<00:01:29.759> adding<00:01:30.060> that<00:01:30.090> phosphate<00:01:30.630> so<00:01:30.840> adenosine

00:01:31.460 --> 00:01:31.470 
by adding that phosphate so adenosine

00:01:31.470 --> 00:01:34.219 
by adding that phosphate so adenosine
tri<00:01:31.829> phosphate<00:01:32.700> three<00:01:33.299> phosphate<00:01:33.780> groups<00:01:33.810> and

00:01:34.219 --> 00:01:34.229 
tri phosphate three phosphate groups and

00:01:34.229 --> 00:01:36.230 
tri phosphate three phosphate groups and
now<00:01:34.650> look<00:01:34.890> how<00:01:35.009> much<00:01:35.130> energy<00:01:35.400> it<00:01:35.670> has<00:01:35.700> it<00:01:36.060> can

00:01:36.230 --> 00:01:36.240 
now look how much energy it has it can

00:01:36.240 --> 00:01:38.090 
now look how much energy it has it can
do<00:01:36.329> a<00:01:36.360> lot<00:01:36.450> of<00:01:36.720> work<00:01:36.869> and<00:01:37.140> can<00:01:37.590> light<00:01:37.770> up<00:01:37.829> your

00:01:38.090 --> 00:01:38.100 
do a lot of work and can light up your

00:01:38.100 --> 00:01:43.219 
do a lot of work and can light up your
room<00:01:38.340> now<00:01:38.549> so<00:01:39.270> think<00:01:39.630> of<00:01:39.750> ATP<00:01:40.439> as<00:01:40.680> a<00:01:41.040> battery<00:01:42.229> we

00:01:43.219 --> 00:01:43.229 
room now so think of ATP as a battery we

00:01:43.229 --> 00:01:45.590 
room now so think of ATP as a battery we
add<00:01:43.350> another<00:01:43.619> phosphate<00:01:43.950> to<00:01:44.340> make<00:01:44.490> it<00:01:44.640> ATP<00:01:45.299> and

00:01:45.590 --> 00:01:45.600 
add another phosphate to make it ATP and

00:01:45.600 --> 00:01:47.810 
add another phosphate to make it ATP and
it<00:01:45.750> becomes<00:01:46.049> very<00:01:46.170> energetic<00:01:46.920> kind<00:01:47.549> of<00:01:47.610> how<00:01:47.759> we

00:01:47.810 --> 00:01:47.820 
it becomes very energetic kind of how we

00:01:47.820 --> 00:01:50.120 
it becomes very energetic kind of how we
made<00:01:48.119> these<00:01:48.479> popsicle<00:01:49.439> stick<00:01:49.740> models

00:01:50.120 --> 00:01:50.130 
made these popsicle stick models

00:01:50.130 --> 00:01:53.480 
made these popsicle stick models
remember<00:01:50.939> that<00:01:51.149> what<00:01:51.540> the<00:01:51.750> more<00:01:52.490> popsicle

00:01:53.480 --> 00:01:53.490 
remember that what the more popsicle

00:01:53.490 --> 00:01:55.249 
remember that what the more popsicle
sticks<00:01:53.729> are<00:01:53.970> the<00:01:54.030> more<00:01:54.210> phosphates<00:01:54.869> that<00:01:55.140> we

00:01:55.249 --> 00:01:55.259 
sticks are the more phosphates that we

00:01:55.259 --> 00:01:57.950 
sticks are the more phosphates that we
added<00:01:55.590> the<00:01:56.070> more<00:01:56.280> unstable<00:01:56.490> or<00:01:57.149> energetic

00:01:57.950 --> 00:01:57.960 
added the more unstable or energetic

00:01:57.960 --> 00:02:00.620 
added the more unstable or energetic
this<00:01:58.320> molecule<00:01:58.619> became<00:01:59.250> and<00:01:59.520> we<00:02:00.149> felt<00:02:00.540> that

00:02:00.620 --> 00:02:00.630 
this molecule became and we felt that

00:02:00.630 --> 00:02:02.420 
this molecule became and we felt that
energy<00:02:01.200> being<00:02:01.409> stored<00:02:01.770> in<00:02:01.890> the<00:02:01.979> bonds<00:02:02.280> because

00:02:02.420 --> 00:02:02.430 
energy being stored in the bonds because

00:02:02.430 --> 00:02:04.219 
energy being stored in the bonds because
it<00:02:02.700> was<00:02:02.820> really<00:02:03.060> hard<00:02:03.240> to<00:02:03.299> make<00:02:03.479> these<00:02:03.630> and<00:02:03.869> I

00:02:04.219 --> 00:02:04.229 
it was really hard to make these and I

00:02:04.229 --> 00:02:05.959 
it was really hard to make these and I
think<00:02:04.439> some<00:02:05.100> students<00:02:05.430> didn't<00:02:05.670> get<00:02:05.759> to<00:02:05.850> make

00:02:05.959 --> 00:02:05.969 
think some students didn't get to make

00:02:05.969 --> 00:02:07.130 
think some students didn't get to make
this<00:02:06.149> because<00:02:06.390> that's<00:02:06.540> how<00:02:06.659> hard<00:02:06.899> it<00:02:07.020> was

00:02:07.130 --> 00:02:07.140 
this because that's how hard it was

00:02:07.140 --> 00:02:09.710 
this because that's how hard it was
right<00:02:07.409> but<00:02:07.979> it<00:02:08.099> has<00:02:08.190> a<00:02:08.220> lot<00:02:08.520> of<00:02:08.550> energy<00:02:08.910> so

00:02:09.710 --> 00:02:09.720 
right but it has a lot of energy so

00:02:09.720 --> 00:02:12.619 
right but it has a lot of energy so
that's<00:02:10.709> a<00:02:10.920> teepee<00:02:11.250> all<00:02:12.060> right<00:02:12.209> so<00:02:12.330> now<00:02:12.450> that<00:02:12.569> we

00:02:12.619 --> 00:02:12.629 
that's a teepee all right so now that we

00:02:12.629 --> 00:02:13.520 
that's a teepee all right so now that we
get<00:02:12.750> that<00:02:12.930> let's

00:02:13.520 --> 00:02:13.530 
get that let's

00:02:13.530 --> 00:02:16.309 
get that let's
talk<00:02:13.620> about<00:02:13.920> this<00:02:14.069> diagram<00:02:14.550> and<00:02:15.170> here<00:02:16.170> in

00:02:16.309 --> 00:02:16.319 
talk about this diagram and here in

00:02:16.319 --> 00:02:18.559 
talk about this diagram and here in
class<00:02:16.620> and<00:02:16.950> in<00:02:17.340> class<00:02:17.610> for<00:02:17.940> before<00:02:18.390> you<00:02:18.480> do

00:02:18.559 --> 00:02:18.569 
class and in class for before you do

00:02:18.569 --> 00:02:21.530 
class and in class for before you do
anything<00:02:18.750> first<00:02:19.440> draw<00:02:20.190> this<00:02:20.400> out<00:02:20.580> if<00:02:21.030> you

00:02:21.530 --> 00:02:21.540 
anything first draw this out if you

00:02:21.540 --> 00:02:23.240 
anything first draw this out if you
don't<00:02:21.720> have<00:02:21.900> it<00:02:22.050> already<00:02:22.170> it's<00:02:22.920> a<00:02:23.040> very

00:02:23.240 --> 00:02:23.250 
don't have it already it's a very

00:02:23.250 --> 00:02:25.370 
don't have it already it's a very
important<00:02:23.580> diagram<00:02:23.880> for<00:02:24.090> tests<00:02:24.420> and<00:02:24.510> that

00:02:25.370 --> 00:02:25.380 
important diagram for tests and that

00:02:25.380 --> 00:02:26.600 
important diagram for tests and that
you're<00:02:25.530> going<00:02:25.650> to<00:02:25.709> see<00:02:25.830> later<00:02:26.010> on<00:02:26.130> okay<00:02:26.550> so

00:02:26.600 --> 00:02:26.610 
you're going to see later on okay so

00:02:26.610 --> 00:02:27.620 
you're going to see later on okay so
what<00:02:26.790> are<00:02:26.850> we<00:02:26.910> have<00:02:27.060> here<00:02:27.240> we<00:02:27.510> have

00:02:27.620 --> 00:02:27.630 
what are we have here we have

00:02:27.630 --> 00:02:29.600 
what are we have here we have
photosynthesis<00:02:28.290> on<00:02:28.410> the<00:02:28.500> left<00:02:28.709> cellular

00:02:29.600 --> 00:02:29.610 
photosynthesis on the left cellular

00:02:29.610 --> 00:02:31.430 
photosynthesis on the left cellular
respiration<00:02:29.880> on<00:02:30.330> the<00:02:30.420> right<00:02:30.569> side<00:02:30.810> let's

00:02:31.430 --> 00:02:31.440 
respiration on the right side let's

00:02:31.440 --> 00:02:32.990 
respiration on the right side let's
break<00:02:31.620> down<00:02:31.680> photosynthesis<00:02:32.610> and<00:02:32.640> what<00:02:32.910> it

00:02:32.990 --> 00:02:33.000 
break down photosynthesis and what it

00:02:33.000 --> 00:02:35.330 
break down photosynthesis and what it
means<00:02:33.120> first<00:02:33.420> so<00:02:33.660> photo<00:02:33.989> means<00:02:34.260> light<00:02:34.380> which

00:02:35.330 --> 00:02:35.340 
means first so photo means light which

00:02:35.340 --> 00:02:37.040 
means first so photo means light which
means<00:02:35.610> to<00:02:35.790> combine<00:02:36.180> okay<00:02:36.660> we're<00:02:36.780> going<00:02:36.870> to<00:02:36.959> use

00:02:37.040 --> 00:02:37.050 
means to combine okay we're going to use

00:02:37.050 --> 00:02:39.110 
means to combine okay we're going to use
light<00:02:37.230> to<00:02:37.260> combine<00:02:37.739> two<00:02:38.430> things<00:02:38.700> water<00:02:38.970> and

00:02:39.110 --> 00:02:39.120 
light to combine two things water and

00:02:39.120 --> 00:02:41.150 
light to combine two things water and
oxygen<00:02:39.209> to<00:02:39.540> make<00:02:39.780> glucose<00:02:40.140> so<00:02:40.800> here<00:02:41.010> we're

00:02:41.150 --> 00:02:41.160 
oxygen to make glucose so here we're

00:02:41.160 --> 00:02:42.890 
oxygen to make glucose so here we're
creating<00:02:41.459> glucose<00:02:41.790> which<00:02:42.000> is<00:02:42.150> a<00:02:42.180> carbohydrate

00:02:42.890 --> 00:02:42.900 
creating glucose which is a carbohydrate

00:02:42.900 --> 00:02:46.030 
creating glucose which is a carbohydrate
it's<00:02:43.410> made<00:02:43.560> up<00:02:43.650> of<00:02:43.739> carbon<00:02:44.010> and<00:02:44.390> water<00:02:45.390> and

00:02:46.030 --> 00:02:46.040 
it's made up of carbon and water and

00:02:46.040 --> 00:02:48.890 
it's made up of carbon and water and
carbohydrate<00:02:47.040> and<00:02:47.220> carbon<00:02:48.209> dioxide<00:02:48.720> and

00:02:48.890 --> 00:02:48.900 
carbohydrate and carbon dioxide and

00:02:48.900 --> 00:02:51.320 
carbohydrate and carbon dioxide and
water<00:02:48.930> combined<00:02:49.440> to<00:02:49.620> make<00:02:49.970> glucose<00:02:50.970> okay<00:02:51.269> so

00:02:51.320 --> 00:02:51.330 
water combined to make glucose okay so

00:02:51.330 --> 00:02:53.720 
water combined to make glucose okay so
what<00:02:51.720> we<00:02:51.840> have<00:02:51.989> here<00:02:52.019> is<00:02:52.250> glucose<00:02:53.250> and<00:02:53.459> once<00:02:53.610> we

00:02:53.720 --> 00:02:53.730 
what we have here is glucose and once we

00:02:53.730 --> 00:02:55.490 
what we have here is glucose and once we
make<00:02:53.910> it<00:02:54.060> we<00:02:54.180> can<00:02:54.330> also<00:02:54.450> make<00:02:54.900> turn<00:02:55.260> it<00:02:55.380> into

00:02:55.490 --> 00:02:55.500 
make it we can also make turn it into

00:02:55.500 --> 00:02:56.810 
make it we can also make turn it into
other<00:02:55.739> things<00:02:55.800> like<00:02:56.220> proteins<00:02:56.640> lipids

00:02:56.810 --> 00:02:56.820 
other things like proteins lipids

00:02:56.820 --> 00:02:59.270 
other things like proteins lipids
carbohydrates<00:02:57.209> and<00:02:58.200> nucleic<00:02:58.560> acids<00:02:58.890> based<00:02:59.100> on

00:02:59.270 --> 00:02:59.280 
carbohydrates and nucleic acids based on

00:02:59.280 --> 00:03:01.490 
carbohydrates and nucleic acids based on
what<00:02:59.459> the<00:02:59.580> plant<00:02:59.819> needs<00:03:00.050> okay<00:03:01.050> so<00:03:01.110> over<00:03:01.380> here

00:03:01.490 --> 00:03:01.500 
what the plant needs okay so over here

00:03:01.500 --> 00:03:02.960 
what the plant needs okay so over here
in<00:03:01.590> cellular<00:03:01.890> respiration<00:03:01.920> look<00:03:02.640> at<00:03:02.730> the<00:03:02.819> word

00:03:02.960 --> 00:03:02.970 
in cellular respiration look at the word

00:03:02.970 --> 00:03:05.509 
in cellular respiration look at the word
SPOC<00:03:03.690> on<00:03:03.810> respiration<00:03:04.290> which<00:03:05.100> means<00:03:05.370> to

00:03:05.509 --> 00:03:05.519 
SPOC on respiration which means to

00:03:05.519 --> 00:03:06.979 
SPOC on respiration which means to
breathe<00:03:05.700> in<00:03:05.819> oxygen<00:03:05.970> and<00:03:06.510> to<00:03:06.630> breathe<00:03:06.840> out

00:03:06.979 --> 00:03:06.989 
breathe in oxygen and to breathe out

00:03:06.989 --> 00:03:09.229 
breathe in oxygen and to breathe out
carbon<00:03:07.470> dioxide<00:03:07.790> so<00:03:08.790> we're<00:03:08.910> going<00:03:09.000> to<00:03:09.090> do<00:03:09.150> is

00:03:09.229 --> 00:03:09.239 
carbon dioxide so we're going to do is

00:03:09.239 --> 00:03:12.320 
carbon dioxide so we're going to do is
going<00:03:09.269> to<00:03:09.450> break<00:03:09.569> down<00:03:09.750> glucose<00:03:10.140> and<00:03:11.239> with<00:03:12.239> the

00:03:12.320 --> 00:03:12.330 
going to break down glucose and with the

00:03:12.330 --> 00:03:15.110 
going to break down glucose and with the
help<00:03:12.480> of<00:03:12.600> oxygen<00:03:13.140> of<00:03:13.260> course<00:03:13.940> glucose<00:03:14.940> is

00:03:15.110 --> 00:03:15.120 
help of oxygen of course glucose is

00:03:15.120 --> 00:03:16.940 
help of oxygen of course glucose is
split<00:03:15.390> in<00:03:15.540> half<00:03:15.780> and<00:03:16.110> then<00:03:16.170> it's<00:03:16.350> broken<00:03:16.769> down

00:03:16.940 --> 00:03:16.950 
split in half and then it's broken down

00:03:16.950 --> 00:03:20.509 
split in half and then it's broken down
even<00:03:17.340> more<00:03:17.370> and<00:03:18.350> we<00:03:19.350> release<00:03:19.890> energy<00:03:20.160> and

00:03:20.509 --> 00:03:20.519 
even more and we release energy and

00:03:20.519 --> 00:03:22.520 
even more and we release energy and
store<00:03:20.760> it<00:03:20.820> into<00:03:21.000> ATP<00:03:21.510> that's<00:03:21.930> the<00:03:22.170> whole<00:03:22.320> point

00:03:22.520 --> 00:03:22.530 
store it into ATP that's the whole point

00:03:22.530 --> 00:03:24.110 
store it into ATP that's the whole point
of<00:03:22.650> breaking<00:03:22.799> breaking<00:03:23.340> down<00:03:23.549> glucose<00:03:23.880> it<00:03:24.030> has

00:03:24.110 --> 00:03:24.120 
of breaking breaking down glucose it has

00:03:24.120 --> 00:03:25.430 
of breaking breaking down glucose it has
a<00:03:24.150> lot<00:03:24.390> of<00:03:24.420> energy<00:03:24.720> waiting<00:03:25.110> to<00:03:25.230> be<00:03:25.320> released

00:03:25.430 --> 00:03:25.440 
a lot of energy waiting to be released

00:03:25.440 --> 00:03:29.120 
a lot of energy waiting to be released
and<00:03:26.120> in<00:03:27.120> other<00:03:27.810> molecules<00:03:28.350> as<00:03:28.500> well<00:03:28.709> you're

00:03:29.120 --> 00:03:29.130 
and in other molecules as well you're

00:03:29.130 --> 00:03:31.009 
and in other molecules as well you're
going<00:03:29.280> to<00:03:29.340> break<00:03:29.430> it<00:03:29.640> down<00:03:29.820> you<00:03:30.780> could<00:03:30.930> be

00:03:31.009 --> 00:03:31.019 
going to break it down you could be

00:03:31.019 --> 00:03:32.840 
going to break it down you could be
breaking<00:03:31.350> now<00:03:31.440> not<00:03:31.620> just<00:03:31.650> glucose<00:03:32.130> but<00:03:32.340> lipids

00:03:32.840 --> 00:03:32.850 
breaking now not just glucose but lipids

00:03:32.850 --> 00:03:36.590 
breaking now not just glucose but lipids
proteins<00:03:34.160> other<00:03:35.160> carbohydrates<00:03:35.850> even

00:03:36.590 --> 00:03:36.600

proteins other carbohydrates even
nucleic<00:03:37.290> acids<00:03:37.709> you<00:03:37.769> can<00:03:37.920> break<00:03:38.100> them<00:03:38.220> down

00:03:38.240 --> 00:03:38.250 
nucleic acids you can break them down

00:03:38.250 --> 00:03:40.670 
nucleic acids you can break them down
for<00:03:38.459> energy<00:03:38.790> if<00:03:38.880> you<00:03:38.910> need<00:03:39.320> okay<00:03:40.320> so<00:03:40.380> now<00:03:40.650> let's

00:03:40.670 --> 00:03:40.680 
for energy if you need okay so now let's

00:03:40.680 --> 00:03:44.770 
for energy if you need okay so now let's
go<00:03:41.160> into<00:03:41.430> our<00:03:41.549> drawing<00:03:43.220> who<00:03:44.220> does

00:03:44.770 --> 00:03:44.780 
go into our drawing who does

00:03:44.780 --> 00:03:46.880 
go into our drawing who does
photosynthesis<00:03:45.780> well<00:03:46.019> we<00:03:46.170> have<00:03:46.290> plants<00:03:46.709> algae

00:03:46.880 --> 00:03:46.890 
photosynthesis well we have plants algae

00:03:46.890 --> 00:03:48.680 
photosynthesis well we have plants algae
and<00:03:47.370> some<00:03:47.579> bacteria<00:03:48.090> to<00:03:48.269> remember<00:03:48.540> those

three<00:03:48.900> types<00:03:49.140> it's<00:03:49.560> not<00:03:49.680> just<00:03:49.739> plants<00:03:50.160> other

00:03:50.840 --> 00:03:50.850 
three types it's not just plants other

00:03:50.850 --> 00:03:52.880 
three types it's not just plants other
creatures<00:03:51.269> do<00:03:51.450> it<00:03:51.570> as<00:03:51.660> well<00:03:51.810> who<00:03:52.709> does

00:03:52.880 --> 00:03:52.890 
creatures do it as well who does

00:03:52.890 --> 00:03:55.160 
creatures do it as well who does
respiration<00:03:53.790> we'll<00:03:53.940> all<00:03:54.150> organisms<00:03:54.660> even

00:03:55.160 --> 00:03:55.170 
respiration we'll all organisms even

00:03:55.170 --> 00:03:58.490 
respiration we'll all organisms even
plants<00:03:55.590> we<00:03:56.160> all<00:03:56.310> need<00:03:56.459> a<00:03:56.519> break<00:03:56.579> down<00:03:57.500> glucose

00:03:58.490 --> 00:03:58.500 
plants we all need a break down glucose

00:03:58.500 --> 00:04:02.090 
plants we all need a break down glucose
or<00:03:58.709> other<00:03:59.700> food<00:04:00.420> molecules<00:04:00.739> so<00:04:01.739> we<00:04:01.859> start<00:04:02.070> with

00:04:02.090 --> 00:04:02.100 
or other food molecules so we start with

00:04:23.450 --> 00:04:23.460 
you direct food energy or chemical

00:04:23.460 --> 00:04:25.909 
you direct food energy or chemical
energy<00:04:23.610> so<00:04:24.479> how<00:04:24.690> do<00:04:24.750> you<00:04:24.930> recharge<00:04:25.470> and<00:04:25.740> how<00:04:25.860> do

00:04:25.909 --> 00:04:25.919 
energy so how do you recharge and how do

00:04:25.919 --> 00:04:27.360 
energy so how do you recharge and how do
you<00:04:25.979> get<00:04:26.099> that<00:04:26.250> energy<00:04:26.430> to<00:04:26.669> make<00:04:26.970> you<00:04:27.090> do

00:04:27.360 --> 00:04:27.370 
you get that energy to make you do

00:04:27.370 --> 00:04:29.640 
you get that energy to make you do
work<00:04:27.490> and<00:04:27.820> to<00:04:28.060> do<00:04:28.210> things<00:04:28.510> well<00:04:29.229> you<00:04:29.350> got<00:04:29.380> to

00:04:29.640 --> 00:04:29.650 
work and to do things well you got to

00:04:29.650 --> 00:04:32.219 
work and to do things well you got to
get<00:04:29.800> it<00:04:29.919> from<00:04:30.220> a<00:04:30.430> food<00:04:30.790> molecule<00:04:31.330> which<00:04:32.050> is

00:04:32.219 --> 00:04:32.229 
get it from a food molecule which is

00:04:32.229 --> 00:04:33.480 
get it from a food molecule which is
something<00:04:32.560> that<00:04:32.710> eventually<00:04:33.190> a<00:04:33.220> plant

00:04:33.480 --> 00:04:33.490 
something that eventually a plant

00:04:33.490 --> 00:04:35.790 
something that eventually a plant
created<00:04:33.729> anyway<00:04:34.210> so<00:04:35.020> let's<00:04:35.169> go<00:04:35.380> to<00:04:35.470> the<00:04:35.620> left

00:04:35.790 --> 00:04:35.800 
created anyway so let's go to the left

00:04:35.800 --> 00:04:39.060 
created anyway so let's go to the left
side<00:04:36.010> so<00:04:36.760> here<00:04:36.940> we<00:04:37.030> have<00:04:37.060> sunlight<00:04:37.389> and<00:04:38.070> plants

00:04:39.060 --> 00:04:39.070 
side so here we have sunlight and plants

00:04:39.070 --> 00:04:43.260 
side so here we have sunlight and plants
can<00:04:39.280> take<00:04:39.550> this<00:04:39.870> unusable<00:04:41.280> Sun<00:04:42.280> light<00:04:42.760> energy

00:04:43.260 --> 00:04:43.270 
can take this unusable Sun light energy

00:04:43.270 --> 00:04:47.250 
can take this unusable Sun light energy
and<00:04:43.860> use<00:04:44.860> it<00:04:45.070> to<00:04:45.100> combine<00:04:45.900> water<00:04:46.900> which<00:04:47.229> is

00:04:47.250 --> 00:04:47.260 
and use it to combine water which is

00:04:47.260 --> 00:04:50.040 
and use it to combine water which is
taken<00:04:47.680> up<00:04:47.740> by<00:04:47.800> the<00:04:47.919> roots<00:04:48.130> and<00:04:48.600> carbon<00:04:49.600> dioxide

00:04:50.040 --> 00:04:50.050 
taken up by the roots and carbon dioxide

00:04:50.050 --> 00:04:54.210 
taken up by the roots and carbon dioxide
which<00:04:50.260> is<00:04:50.440> a<00:04:50.470> carbon<00:04:50.830> in<00:04:51.130> the<00:04:51.449> air<00:04:52.449> and<00:04:53.220> the

00:04:54.210 --> 00:04:54.220 
which is a carbon in the air and the

00:04:54.220 --> 00:04:56.730 
which is a carbon in the air and the
plants<00:04:54.610> will<00:04:54.760> take<00:04:55.060> that<00:04:55.300> and<00:04:55.540> make<00:04:55.900> glucose

00:04:56.730 --> 00:04:56.740 
plants will take that and make glucose

00:04:56.740 --> 00:04:58.770 
plants will take that and make glucose
now<00:04:57.310> the<00:04:57.370> glucose<00:04:57.790> is<00:04:58.000> distributed

00:04:58.770 --> 00:04:58.780 
now the glucose is distributed

00:04:58.780 --> 00:05:00.210 
now the glucose is distributed
throughout<00:04:59.020> the<00:04:59.110> plant<00:04:59.500> or<00:04:59.740> throughout<00:05:00.039> the

00:05:00.210 --> 00:05:00.220 
throughout the plant or throughout the

00:05:00.220 --> 00:05:02.730 
throughout the plant or throughout the
body<00:05:00.400> so<00:05:01.180> that<00:05:01.210> other<00:05:01.600> parts<00:05:01.930> of<00:05:02.050> the<00:05:02.110> plant

00:05:02.730 --> 00:05:02.740 
body so that other parts of the plant

00:05:02.740 --> 00:05:05.189 
body so that other parts of the plant
can<00:05:02.979> get<00:05:03.220> that<00:05:03.520> sugar<00:05:03.940> what<00:05:04.630> they<00:05:04.780> need<00:05:04.960> or<00:05:05.110> a

00:05:05.189 --> 00:05:05.199 
can get that sugar what they need or a

00:05:05.199 --> 00:05:07.740 
can get that sugar what they need or a
lot<00:05:06.190> of<00:05:06.310> it<00:05:06.430> is<00:05:06.520> put<00:05:06.760> into<00:05:06.970> fruits<00:05:07.330> as<00:05:07.510> we<00:05:07.660> all

00:05:07.740 --> 00:05:07.750 
lot of it is put into fruits as we all

00:05:07.750 --> 00:05:09.439 
lot of it is put into fruits as we all
know<00:05:07.900> it<00:05:08.020> taste<00:05:08.260> is<00:05:08.470> very<00:05:08.530> tasty<00:05:08.889> there<00:05:09.250> and

00:05:09.439 --> 00:05:09.449 
know it taste is very tasty there and

00:05:09.449 --> 00:05:11.820 
know it taste is very tasty there and
now<00:05:10.449> it's<00:05:10.630> there<00:05:10.900> it's<00:05:11.350> all<00:05:11.440> over<00:05:11.620> the<00:05:11.710> body

00:05:11.820 --> 00:05:11.830 
now it's there it's all over the body

00:05:11.830 --> 00:05:14.670 
now it's there it's all over the body
and<00:05:12.130> then<00:05:13.120> it<00:05:13.330> also<00:05:13.539> makes<00:05:13.900> oxygen<00:05:14.530> by

00:05:14.670 --> 00:05:14.680 
and then it also makes oxygen by

00:05:14.680 --> 00:05:16.980 
and then it also makes oxygen by
accident<00:05:15.250> as<00:05:15.340> you'll<00:05:15.550> see<00:05:15.729> later<00:05:15.760> and<00:05:16.270> so

00:05:16.980 --> 00:05:16.990 
accident as you'll see later and so

00:05:16.990 --> 00:05:19.439 
accident as you'll see later and so
oxygen<00:05:17.320> is<00:05:17.500> made<00:05:17.680> and<00:05:18.090> well<00:05:19.090> how<00:05:19.210> does<00:05:19.270> that

00:05:19.439 --> 00:05:19.449 
oxygen is made and well how does that

00:05:19.449 --> 00:05:22.590 
oxygen is made and well how does that
relate<00:05:19.510> to<00:05:19.750> us<00:05:20.139> well<00:05:20.620> we<00:05:21.520> breathe<00:05:22.090> in<00:05:22.270> that

00:05:22.590 --> 00:05:22.600 
relate to us well we breathe in that

00:05:22.600 --> 00:05:26.640 
relate to us well we breathe in that
oxygen<00:05:23.139> we<00:05:24.010> eat<00:05:24.430> that<00:05:24.789> glucose<00:05:25.360> and<00:05:25.660> then<00:05:26.440> we

00:05:26.640 --> 00:05:26.650 
oxygen we eat that glucose and then we

00:05:26.650 --> 00:05:29.279 
oxygen we eat that glucose and then we
take<00:05:26.889> it<00:05:27.039> into<00:05:27.190> our<00:05:27.370> bodies<00:05:27.729> it<00:05:28.150> gets<00:05:29.020> broken

00:05:29.279 --> 00:05:29.289 
take it into our bodies it gets broken

00:05:29.289 --> 00:05:31.800 
take it into our bodies it gets broken
down<00:05:29.500> by<00:05:29.680> our<00:05:29.740> diet<00:05:30.039> digestive<00:05:30.880> system<00:05:31.270> gets

00:05:31.800 --> 00:05:31.810 
down by our diet digestive system gets

00:05:31.810 --> 00:05:33.719 
down by our diet digestive system gets
taken<00:05:32.020> into<00:05:32.320> the<00:05:32.410> blood<00:05:32.650> delivered<00:05:33.610> to

00:05:33.719 --> 00:05:33.729 
taken into the blood delivered to

00:05:33.729 --> 00:05:35.430 
taken into the blood delivered to
ourselves<00:05:33.849> and<00:05:34.419> then<00:05:34.960> enters<00:05:35.320> the

00:05:35.430 --> 00:05:35.440 
ourselves and then enters the

00:05:35.440 --> 00:05:37.860 
ourselves and then enters the
mitochondria<00:05:36.130> where<00:05:36.310> oxygen<00:05:37.180> breaks<00:05:37.599> your

00:05:37.860 --> 00:05:37.870 
mitochondria where oxygen breaks your

00:05:37.870 --> 00:05:41.040 
mitochondria where oxygen breaks your
glucose<00:05:38.260> down<00:05:38.700> into<00:05:39.700> three<00:05:39.940> things<00:05:40.150> you<00:05:40.960> know

00:05:41.040 --> 00:05:41.050 
glucose down into three things you know

00:05:41.050 --> 00:05:44.010 
glucose down into three things you know
water<00:05:41.289> carbon<00:05:41.830> dioxide<00:05:42.220> and<00:05:42.490> ATP<00:05:43.000> so<00:05:43.780> this

00:05:44.010 --> 00:05:44.020 
water carbon dioxide and ATP so this

00:05:44.020 --> 00:05:45.510 
water carbon dioxide and ATP so this
guy's<00:05:44.200> not<00:05:44.380> getting<00:05:44.650> electrocuted<00:05:44.979> it<00:05:45.340> just

00:05:45.510 --> 00:05:45.520 
guy's not getting electrocuted it just

00:05:45.520 --> 00:05:48.390 
guy's not getting electrocuted it just
means<00:05:45.700> that<00:05:45.820> it's<00:05:46.120> getting<00:05:46.270> energy<00:05:46.979> ATP<00:05:47.979> form

00:05:48.390 --> 00:05:48.400 
means that it's getting energy ATP form

00:05:48.400 --> 00:05:50.550 
means that it's getting energy ATP form
now<00:05:49.300> let's<00:05:49.539> go<00:05:49.660> a<00:05:49.690> little<00:05:50.050> more<00:05:50.260> into<00:05:50.470> this

00:05:50.550 --> 00:05:50.560 
now let's go a little more into this

00:05:50.560 --> 00:05:52.200 
now let's go a little more into this
diagram<00:05:50.979> which<00:05:51.130> is<00:05:51.250> our<00:05:51.370> chloroplast<00:05:51.940> this<00:05:52.090> is

00:05:52.200 --> 00:05:52.210 
diagram which is our chloroplast this is

00:05:52.210 --> 00:05:54.480 
diagram which is our chloroplast this is
where<00:05:52.389> it<00:05:52.450> happens<00:05:52.780> you<00:05:53.530> have<00:05:53.560> sunlight

00:05:54.480 --> 00:05:54.490 
where it happens you have sunlight

00:05:54.490 --> 00:05:58.560 
where it happens you have sunlight
hitting<00:05:55.360> right<00:05:55.660> here<00:05:55.960> the<00:05:57.060> which<00:05:58.060> you'll<00:05:58.270> find

00:05:58.560 --> 00:05:58.570 
hitting right here the which you'll find

00:05:58.570 --> 00:06:00.150 
hitting right here the which you'll find
out<00:05:58.750> later<00:05:58.780> these<00:05:59.139> are<00:05:59.320> thylakoids<00:05:59.949> and

00:06:00.150 --> 00:06:00.160 
out later these are thylakoids and

00:06:00.160 --> 00:06:03.089 
out later these are thylakoids and
there's<00:06:00.910> chlorophyll<00:06:01.539> in<00:06:01.690> there<00:06:01.870> and<00:06:02.099> that's

00:06:03.089 --> 00:06:03.099 
there's chlorophyll in there and that's

00:06:03.099 --> 00:06:06.029 
there's chlorophyll in there and that's
what<00:06:03.310> traps<00:06:03.610> the<00:06:03.910> sunlight<00:06:04.510> energy<00:06:04.680> you<00:06:05.680> also

00:06:06.029 --> 00:06:06.039 
what traps the sunlight energy you also

00:06:06.039 --> 00:06:08.719 
what traps the sunlight energy you also
have<00:06:06.250> water<00:06:06.669> coming<00:06:06.760> in<00:06:07.150> and<00:06:07.360> carbon<00:06:08.289> dioxide

00:06:08.719 --> 00:06:08.729 
have water coming in and carbon dioxide

00:06:08.729 --> 00:06:10.800 
have water coming in and carbon dioxide
these<00:06:09.729> are<00:06:09.880> the<00:06:09.970> three<00:06:10.180> ingredients<00:06:10.210> they

00:06:10.800 --> 00:06:10.810 
these are the three ingredients they

00:06:10.810 --> 00:06:13.710 
these are the three ingredients they
come<00:06:11.020> in<00:06:11.169> and<00:06:11.349> we<00:06:12.190> again<00:06:12.849> turn<00:06:13.090> carbon<00:06:13.419> dioxide

00:06:13.710 --> 00:06:13.720 
come in and we again turn carbon dioxide

00:06:13.720 --> 00:06:16.260 
come in and we again turn carbon dioxide
into<00:06:13.960> glucose<00:06:14.580> there<00:06:15.580> goes<00:06:15.789> our<00:06:15.940> glucose

00:06:16.260 --> 00:06:16.270 
into glucose there goes our glucose

00:06:16.270 --> 00:06:18.810 
into glucose there goes our glucose
molecule<00:06:16.720> we<00:06:16.810> also<00:06:16.960> get<00:06:17.199> oxygen<00:06:17.620> and<00:06:17.800> so<00:06:18.699> if

00:06:18.810 --> 00:06:18.820 
molecule we also get oxygen and so if

00:06:18.820 --> 00:06:20.370 
molecule we also get oxygen and so if
you<00:06:18.849> put<00:06:19.060> that<00:06:19.210> in<00:06:19.330> your<00:06:19.360> equation<00:06:19.660> remember

00:06:20.370 --> 00:06:20.380 
you put that in your equation remember

00:06:20.380 --> 00:06:21.930 
you put that in your equation remember
everything<00:06:20.650> on<00:06:20.889> the<00:06:21.039> left<00:06:21.250> is<00:06:21.400> what's<00:06:21.610> going

00:06:21.930 --> 00:06:21.940 
everything on the left is what's going

00:06:21.940 --> 00:06:23.490 
everything on the left is what's going
in<00:06:22.120> everything<00:06:22.900> on<00:06:23.050> the<00:06:23.139> right<00:06:23.289> is<00:06:23.410> what's

00:06:23.490 --> 00:06:23.500 
in everything on the right is what's

00:06:23.500 --> 00:06:26.100 
in everything on the right is what's
going<00:06:23.800> out<00:06:23.889> so<00:06:24.849> what's<00:06:25.060> going<00:06:25.270> in<00:06:25.389> here<00:06:25.599> while

00:06:26.100 --> 00:06:26.110 
going out so what's going in here while

00:06:26.110 --> 00:06:28.560 
going out so what's going in here while
you're<00:06:26.260> getting<00:06:26.470> light<00:06:27.120> water<00:06:28.120> and<00:06:28.419> carbon

00:06:28.560 --> 00:06:28.570 
you're getting light water and carbon

00:06:28.570 --> 00:06:31.200 
you're getting light water and carbon
dioxide<00:06:28.750> those<00:06:29.320> are<00:06:29.440> the<00:06:29.530> three<00:06:29.770> and<00:06:29.979> you<00:06:30.940> turn

00:06:31.200 --> 00:06:31.210 
dioxide those are the three and you turn

00:06:31.210 --> 00:06:33.839 
dioxide those are the three and you turn
it<00:06:31.360> into<00:06:31.479> glucose<00:06:32.080> and<00:06:32.320> also<00:06:33.070> you<00:06:33.130> get<00:06:33.400> oxygen

00:06:33.839 --> 00:06:33.849 
it into glucose and also you get oxygen

00:06:33.849 --> 00:06:37.260 
it into glucose and also you get oxygen
and<00:06:34.030> then<00:06:35.020> on<00:06:35.139> the<00:06:35.229> other<00:06:35.289> side<00:06:35.590> is<00:06:35.830> well<00:06:36.280> look

00:06:37.260 --> 00:06:37.270 
and then on the other side is well look

00:06:37.270 --> 00:06:39.540 
and then on the other side is well look
at<00:06:37.419> what<00:06:37.570> just<00:06:37.900> came<00:06:38.380> out<00:06:38.620> here<00:06:39.010> is<00:06:39.159> what

00:06:39.540 --> 00:06:39.550 
at what just came out here is what

00:06:39.550 --> 00:06:41.129 
at what just came out here is what
actually<00:06:40.030> goes<00:06:40.180> in<00:06:40.390> here

00:06:41.129 --> 00:06:41.139 
actually goes in here

00:06:41.139 --> 00:06:43.230 
actually goes in here
you<00:06:41.469> get<00:06:41.650> glucose<00:06:42.039> and<00:06:42.280> oxygen<00:06:42.400> going<00:06:42.969> into

00:06:43.230 --> 00:06:43.240 
you get glucose and oxygen going into

00:06:43.240 --> 00:06:45.239 
you get glucose and oxygen going into
the<00:06:43.330> mitochondria<00:06:43.479> and<00:06:44.099> glucose<00:06:45.099> is<00:06:45.219> broken

00:06:45.239 --> 00:06:45.249 
the mitochondria and glucose is broken

00:06:45.249 --> 00:06:47.969 
the mitochondria and glucose is broken
down<00:06:45.759> with<00:06:46.090> the<00:06:46.330> help<00:06:46.479> of<00:06:46.569> oxygen<00:06:47.050> and<00:06:47.199> will

00:06:47.969 --> 00:06:47.979 
down with the help of oxygen and will

00:06:47.979 --> 00:06:50.309 
down with the help of oxygen and will
you<00:06:48.009> get<00:06:48.280> water<00:06:48.580> carbon<00:06:49.120> dioxide<00:06:49.479> and<00:06:49.659> ATP<00:06:49.930> so

00:06:50.309 --> 00:06:50.319 
you get water carbon dioxide and ATP so

00:06:50.319 --> 00:06:52.320 
you get water carbon dioxide and ATP so
you<00:06:50.409> put<00:06:50.680> that<00:06:50.830> here<00:06:51.699> is<00:06:51.819> the<00:06:51.909> same<00:06:52.090> thing

00:06:52.320 --> 00:06:52.330 
you put that here is the same thing

00:06:52.330 --> 00:06:55.830 
you put that here is the same thing
again<00:06:52.900> oxygen<00:06:53.529> glucose<00:06:54.340> coming<00:06:54.639> in<00:06:54.759> so<00:06:55.539> oxygen

00:06:55.830 --> 00:06:55.840 
again oxygen glucose coming in so oxygen

00:06:55.840 --> 00:07:00.510 
again oxygen glucose coming in so oxygen
plus<00:06:56.080> glucose<00:06:56.529> gives<00:06:57.430> us<00:06:58.199> water<00:06:59.520> carbon

00:07:00.510 --> 00:07:00.520 
plus glucose gives us water carbon

00:07:00.520 --> 00:07:03.839 
plus glucose gives us water carbon
dioxide<00:07:00.939> and<00:07:01.499> ATP<00:07:02.499> there<00:07:03.219> you<00:07:03.340> go<00:07:03.490> so<00:07:03.669> now<00:07:03.789> you

00:07:03.839 --> 00:07:03.849 
dioxide and ATP there you go so now you

00:07:03.849 --> 00:07:06.179 
dioxide and ATP there you go so now you
have<00:07:04.060> ATP<00:07:04.749> and<00:07:05.289> remember<00:07:05.680> why<00:07:05.889> this<00:07:05.949> was

00:07:06.179 --> 00:07:06.189 
have ATP and remember why this was

00:07:06.189 --> 00:07:08.369 
have ATP and remember why this was
important<00:07:06.729> because<00:07:07.270> it<00:07:07.629> has<00:07:07.900> that<00:07:08.139> third

00:07:08.369 --> 00:07:08.379 
important because it has that third

00:07:08.379 --> 00:07:10.860 
important because it has that third
phosphate<00:07:08.650> it<00:07:09.099> now<00:07:09.310> has<00:07:09.580> so<00:07:09.789> much<00:07:09.909> energy<00:07:10.120> that

00:07:10.860 --> 00:07:10.870 
phosphate it now has so much energy that

00:07:10.870 --> 00:07:12.570 
phosphate it now has so much energy that
it<00:07:11.020> can<00:07:11.139> drive<00:07:11.349> our<00:07:11.650> chemical<00:07:12.189> reactions<00:07:12.550> in

00:07:12.570 --> 00:07:12.580 
it can drive our chemical reactions in

00:07:12.580 --> 00:07:16.560 
it can drive our chemical reactions in
the<00:07:12.639> body<00:07:12.819> and<00:07:13.120> allow<00:07:13.930> us<00:07:14.080> to<00:07:14.169> do<00:07:14.289> things
