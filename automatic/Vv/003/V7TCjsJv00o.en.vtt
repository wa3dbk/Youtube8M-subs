00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.859
 nintendo's nx console is currently still 

00:00:02.580 --> 00:00:07.830
 a big mystery or one too 

00:00:04.859 --> 00:00:08.940
 big question mark box, however, gives 

00:00:07.830 --> 00:00:11.730
 there are some information in the net already 

00:00:08.940 --> 00:00:12.840
 and facts on the part and let it out 

00:00:11.730 --> 00:00:14.940
 also very interesting 

00:00:12.840 --> 00:00:16.440
 speculation spinning and all that 

00:00:14.940 --> 00:00:17.400
 you get compact now 

00:00:16.440 --> 00:00:21.930
 summarized 

00:00:17.400 --> 00:00:23.400
 Have fun before we get started 

00:00:21.930 --> 00:00:25.199
 short the opportunity to use too 

00:00:23.400 --> 00:00:26.310
 a few words about the death of satoru iwata 

00:00:25.199 --> 00:00:28.050
 accept 

00:00:26.310 --> 00:00:29.490
 Personally, I am really very heavy 

00:00:28.050 --> 00:00:31.140
 affected by this message 

00:00:29.490 --> 00:00:33.480
 because I just as a great nintendo fan 

00:00:31.140 --> 00:00:34.800
 Of course iwata has known for years 

00:00:33.480 --> 00:00:36.390
 and pursue intensively 

00:00:34.800 --> 00:00:37.770
 and even if I'm not with all of his 

00:00:36.390 --> 00:00:39.210
 decisions have been compliant 

00:00:37.770 --> 00:00:41.100
 I always had the impression that 

00:00:39.210 --> 00:00:43.230
 He is a great person and a great one 

00:00:41.100 --> 00:00:44.730
 has been a boss and thus is a death 

00:00:43.230 --> 00:00:46.800
 of course a heavy loss for all 

00:00:44.730 --> 00:00:49.829
 nintendo and actually for the 

00:00:46.800 --> 00:00:51.210
 entire gaming landscape and yes how 

00:00:49.829 --> 00:00:52.440
 I also want to be very personal 

00:00:51.210 --> 00:00:53.789
 hard hit and that's why I have 

00:00:52.440 --> 00:00:55.379
 also an article on the gare de 

00:00:53.789 --> 00:00:56.340
 where I posted a bit about 

00:00:55.379 --> 00:00:57.899
 his life is talking 

00:00:56.340 --> 00:00:59.520
 if that interests you then look 

00:00:57.899 --> 00:01:01.109
 Definitely clean because that is 

00:00:59.520 --> 00:01:03.270
 really very exciting in my opinion 

00:01:01.109 --> 00:01:05.939
 after you could live the life of satoru 

00:01:03.270 --> 00:01:07.560
 iwata even made a movie but now for 

00:01:05.939 --> 00:01:10.110
 theme that was nothing console 

00:01:07.560 --> 00:01:12.060
 originally announced in march 2015 

00:01:10.110 --> 00:01:14.010
 and at an event where it 

00:01:12.060 --> 00:01:17.700
 actually primarily about the partnership 

00:01:14.010 --> 00:01:18.659
 between nintendo and the nlg so there 

00:01:17.700 --> 00:01:20.640
 it was just about everything 

00:01:18.659 --> 00:01:22.860
 nintendo's foray into the mobile market 

00:01:20.640 --> 00:01:24.000
 So smartphones and tablets and 

00:01:22.860 --> 00:01:25.770
 Nintendo wanted to announce this 

00:01:24.000 --> 00:01:27.450
 but just make it clear 

00:01:25.770 --> 00:01:29.189
 yes, but we will continue the 

00:01:27.450 --> 00:01:31.200
 stay loyal to the console market 

00:01:29.189 --> 00:01:32.850
 always when I over in the past 

00:01:31.200 --> 00:01:34.140
 then the topic innings talked 

00:01:32.850 --> 00:01:35.549
 will always vote directly according to the 

00:01:34.140 --> 00:01:37.680
 say iwata would have on this 

00:01:35.549 --> 00:01:39.420
 event said that the left rather 

00:01:37.680 --> 00:01:41.610
 console no direct successor to the wii 

00:01:39.420 --> 00:01:43.020
 u will be the right but not so 

00:01:41.610 --> 00:01:45.180
 this is unfortunately one 

00:01:43.020 --> 00:01:47.640
 translation errors and also the picture where 

00:01:45.180 --> 00:01:49.799
 one the nx console next to hugh 3ds and 

00:01:47.640 --> 00:01:51.659
 has seen other systems is not 

00:01:49.799 --> 00:01:52.799
 clear indication that it is 

00:01:51.659 --> 00:01:54.630
 no successor will 

00:01:52.799 --> 00:01:56.579
 because it was about the membership 

00:01:54.630 --> 00:01:57.270
 service of connecting all these systems 

00:01:56.579 --> 00:01:59.340
 should 

00:01:57.270 --> 00:02:01.409
 nintendo has already said that the 

00:01:59.340 --> 00:02:03.119
 nx console now not directly with something 

00:02:01.409 --> 00:02:04.920
 So this service should have to do 

00:02:03.119 --> 00:02:07.049
 The service will of course be on the nx 

00:02:04.920 --> 00:02:08.330
 console run but the console should 

00:02:07.049 --> 00:02:10.070
 just over 

00:02:08.330 --> 00:02:12.380
 define their characteristics and the 

00:02:10.070 --> 00:02:13.940
 question is of course what could 

00:02:12.380 --> 00:02:16.250
 that be peculiarities 

00:02:13.940 --> 00:02:18.680
 the wada has already said that the nx 

00:02:16.250 --> 00:02:19.730
 console 3ds and wii u not just 

00:02:18.680 --> 00:02:21.290
 replace 

00:02:19.730 --> 00:02:23.360
 and of course you could do that now 

00:02:21.290 --> 00:02:24.740
 read it out okay will be fine 

00:02:23.360 --> 00:02:26.810
 but a third leg 

00:02:24.740 --> 00:02:28.940
 but I do not believe it because 

00:02:26.810 --> 00:02:30.860
 that would be a damn stupid idea about that 

00:02:28.940 --> 00:02:32.870
 Let's be very clear that knew 

00:02:30.860 --> 00:02:34.730
 luckily on saturo iwata the whole 

00:02:32.870 --> 00:02:36.740
 clearly said if we have three or 

00:02:34.730 --> 00:02:38.600
 We would have four systems then 

00:02:36.740 --> 00:02:40.850
 problem get this with software so 

00:02:38.600 --> 00:02:42.530
 to play and exactly that 

00:02:40.850 --> 00:02:43.970
 is just the sticking point why me 

00:02:42.530 --> 00:02:47.000
 the idea of ​​a third leg it 

00:02:43.970 --> 00:02:48.800
 I've always thought it was stupid 

00:02:47.000 --> 00:02:50.780
 simply can not afford intenso 

00:02:48.800 --> 00:02:52.550
 instead, Nintendo may become 

00:02:50.780 --> 00:02:54.380
 even a completely opposite 

00:02:52.550 --> 00:02:55.040
 dare approach because you have to be alone 

00:02:54.380 --> 00:02:57.020
 let's introduce 

00:02:55.040 --> 00:02:58.430
 even before the announcements were nothing 

00:02:57.020 --> 00:03:00.709
 at nintendo a very blatant 

00:02:58.430 --> 00:03:03.020
 restructuring the research and 

00:03:00.709 --> 00:03:05.510
 development department for handhelds and 

00:03:03.020 --> 00:03:07.190
 Home consoles were merged under 

00:03:05.510 --> 00:03:09.560
 a line and thereby wants 

00:03:07.190 --> 00:03:10.970
 Nintendo in the long run the software 

00:03:09.560 --> 00:03:12.500
 maximize output 

00:03:10.970 --> 00:03:14.630
 say more games more 

00:03:12.500 --> 00:03:19.040
 publications and therefore, of course 

00:03:14.630 --> 00:03:20.540
 also more money for nintendo's for that 

00:03:19.040 --> 00:03:21.860
 nintendo wants the differences 

00:03:20.540 --> 00:03:24.350
 between home consoles and handhelds 

00:03:21.860 --> 00:03:25.610
 minimize further and further 

00:03:24.350 --> 00:03:27.739
 that does not mean that we are in 

00:03:25.610 --> 00:03:29.510
 future on handhelds and home consoles 

00:03:27.739 --> 00:03:31.160
 get the same games one to one 

00:03:29.510 --> 00:03:32.720
 it could just be about it 

00:03:31.160 --> 00:03:34.940
 that now, for example, a mario kart 

00:03:32.720 --> 00:03:37.040
 on handheld and home console on 

00:03:34.940 --> 00:03:38.510
 based on the same codebase and that 

00:03:37.040 --> 00:03:40.010
 would the development behind the 

00:03:38.510 --> 00:03:40.970
 backdrops in course extreme 

00:03:40.010 --> 00:03:42.860
 accelerate 

00:03:40.970 --> 00:03:45.019
 maybe smash brothers was for wii 

00:03:42.860 --> 00:03:46.459
 and 3ds so also a first try in 

00:03:45.019 --> 00:03:48.530
 exactly this direction 

00:03:46.459 --> 00:03:50.150
 nintendo follows this path 

00:03:48.530 --> 00:03:52.850
 especially ios and android 

00:03:50.150 --> 00:03:55.190
 So devices that all systems on 

00:03:52.850 --> 00:03:56.510
 based on the same operating system and 

00:03:55.190 --> 00:03:58.160
 In this way, Nintendo wants 

00:03:56.510 --> 00:04:01.610
 just make sure that different 

00:03:58.160 --> 00:04:03.670
 systems, whether stationary or mobile 

00:04:01.610 --> 00:04:06.049
 are not that different anymore and 

00:04:03.670 --> 00:04:08.480
 many are currently closing that out 

00:04:06.049 --> 00:04:10.100
 nx console actually a hybrid type 

00:04:08.480 --> 00:04:12.680
 So it could be a console 

00:04:10.100 --> 00:04:14.269
 both stationary at home as well as too 

00:04:12.680 --> 00:04:16.370
 can be used on the road 

00:04:14.269 --> 00:04:18.049
 what is the best way to do that now? 

00:04:16.370 --> 00:04:20.150
 Of course, the simplest thought would be that 

00:04:18.049 --> 00:04:22.460
 Just the concept of the view 

00:04:20.150 --> 00:04:23.840
 consequently, a console keeps thinking 

00:04:22.460 --> 00:04:25.460
 the again a kind of tablet 

00:04:23.840 --> 00:04:27.440
 controller has this time, too 

00:04:25.460 --> 00:04:29.030
 completely independent works so 

00:04:27.440 --> 00:04:31.190
 Imagine you are with you 

00:04:29.030 --> 00:04:32.840
 home and plays at the home console and 

00:04:31.190 --> 00:04:34.220
 then you have to go to work and take her 

00:04:32.840 --> 00:04:35.270
 The game is easy with and 

00:04:34.220 --> 00:04:37.130
 keep playing 

00:04:35.270 --> 00:04:38.750
 Of course that's a concept that sony 

00:04:37.130 --> 00:04:39.500
 with the vita already tried 

00:04:38.750 --> 00:04:41.120
 implement 

00:04:39.500 --> 00:04:42.710
 however, it would be very nice at nintendo 

00:04:41.120 --> 00:04:45.080
 much more consistent by just that 

00:04:42.710 --> 00:04:46.699
 the tablet controller of course with the 

00:04:45.080 --> 00:04:48.259
 console is supplied directly and where 

00:04:46.699 --> 00:04:50.780
 man the thing smart why would you do it 

00:04:48.259 --> 00:04:52.400
 not easy to use so that is 

00:04:50.780 --> 00:04:53.900
 Failure of the vita not necessarily one 

00:04:52.400 --> 00:04:55.039
 Indicator that something like that is not 

00:04:53.900 --> 00:04:56.870
 can work 

00:04:55.039 --> 00:04:58.460
 But I do not believe that anyway 

00:04:56.870 --> 00:05:00.500
 really because for me it is 

00:04:58.460 --> 00:05:02.600
 easy to calculate and nintendo 

00:05:00.500 --> 00:05:04.190
 tends to somehow more surprising 

00:05:02.600 --> 00:05:06.590
 to do things so I go somewhere 

00:05:04.190 --> 00:05:08.570
 Also assume that's not the big one 

00:05:06.590 --> 00:05:11.000
 idea is and that nintendo there is something else 

00:05:08.570 --> 00:05:13.099
 very creative and unusual 

00:05:11.000 --> 00:05:15.710
 the following also fits in this way 

00:05:13.099 --> 00:05:17.780
 iwata says it is boring 

00:05:15.710 --> 00:05:18.380
 existing hardware just continues to grow 

00:05:17.780 --> 00:05:20.240
 develop 

00:05:18.380 --> 00:05:22.340
 in some form we always think 

00:05:20.240 --> 00:05:24.289
 about how we surprise players 

00:05:22.340 --> 00:05:25.910
 can and should demand that 

00:05:24.289 --> 00:05:26.690
 Video game live to every person 

00:05:25.910 --> 00:05:28.669
 change 

00:05:26.690 --> 00:05:30.979
 One thing seems already 

00:05:28.669 --> 00:05:33.380
 Relatively sure that will not console 

00:05:30.979 --> 00:05:34.940
 probably not a graphic wonder 

00:05:33.380 --> 00:05:37.159
 on the one hand , iwata already has it all 

00:05:34.940 --> 00:05:39.470
 clearly for nintendo is technology 

00:05:37.159 --> 00:05:41.300
 secondary and more of a means to 

00:05:39.470 --> 00:05:43.639
 purpose for the users good entertainment 

00:05:41.300 --> 00:05:44.960
 to be able to offer and there is another 

00:05:43.639 --> 00:05:47.360
 then also the feed of liam 

00:05:44.960 --> 00:05:48.320
 robertson of sixty four of the 

00:05:47.360 --> 00:05:51.080
 after a conversation with one 

00:05:48.320 --> 00:05:52.940
 informants very sure that's nothing 

00:05:51.080 --> 00:05:55.849
 console not with the power level of 

00:05:52.940 --> 00:05:57.440
 ps4 wants to keep up and dress sixty 

00:05:55.849 --> 00:05:59.120
 four is actually a source one 

00:05:57.440 --> 00:06:00.889
 usually take it seriously 

00:05:59.120 --> 00:06:02.240
 exact information and facts of 

00:06:00.889 --> 00:06:03.919
 nintendo of course remain to be seen 

00:06:02.240 --> 00:06:04.610
 but there we have a long time to go 

00:06:03.919 --> 00:06:06.169
 waiting 

00:06:04.610 --> 00:06:08.570
 because nintendo has already said new 

00:06:06.169 --> 00:06:10.669
 Information is not available until 2016 

00:06:08.570 --> 00:06:13.430
 and I even suspect that we're up to 

00:06:10.669 --> 00:06:15.470
 e3 2016 may wait until nintendo the 

00:06:13.430 --> 00:06:17.690
 Cat finally leaves the bag 

00:06:15.470 --> 00:06:19.400
 and until the console then appears yes 

00:06:17.690 --> 00:06:20.479
 could be quite a while more time 

00:06:19.400 --> 00:06:23.030
 to the country 

00:06:20.479 --> 00:06:25.250
 because you must not forget and endo 

00:06:23.030 --> 00:06:26.470
 tends to consoles very early 

00:06:25.250 --> 00:06:28.840
 to announce 

00:06:26.470 --> 00:06:30.730
 So for example, how do you have 

00:06:28.840 --> 00:06:32.650
 actually already at the e3 2004 

00:06:30.730 --> 00:06:34.720
 announced and the console came then 

00:06:32.650 --> 00:06:37.390
 only in the winter of 2006 more than two 

00:06:34.720 --> 00:06:38.980
 Years later so I'm relatively sure 

00:06:37.390 --> 00:06:40.540
 we will be very much time for 

00:06:38.980 --> 00:06:41.830
 have speculation and it will still be 

00:06:40.540 --> 00:06:43.840
 one or the other interesting rumors 

00:06:41.830 --> 00:06:45.310
 give and informative of 

00:06:43.840 --> 00:06:45.910
 Nintendo will also be there I am 

00:06:45.310 --> 00:06:48.760
 me too 

00:06:45.910 --> 00:06:49.840
 So it would stay exciting until now 

00:06:48.760 --> 00:06:51.700
 but I'm interested in any case 

00:06:49.840 --> 00:06:53.770
 what you think of the idea of ​​a hybrid 

00:06:51.700 --> 00:06:55.870
 console holds and of course what 

00:06:53.770 --> 00:06:58.600
 her to nintendo's plans says that 

00:06:55.870 --> 00:07:00.760
 just handhelds and home consoles closer 

00:06:58.600 --> 00:07:03.250
 to be merged because that 

00:07:00.760 --> 00:07:04.780
 is definitely fact so there are the 

00:07:03.250 --> 00:07:06.850
 sign really very clear and the 

00:07:04.780 --> 00:07:09.400
 say by nintendo so that will be in 

00:07:06.850 --> 00:07:11.470
 Any form come in any case 

00:07:09.400 --> 00:07:12.730
 that was as far from me as always 

00:07:11.470 --> 00:07:14.860
 you can now find two more at the end 

00:07:12.730 --> 00:07:16.450
 on the left, on the one hand, to the one already 

00:07:14.860 --> 00:07:18.940
 at the beginning mentioned article around the car 

00:07:16.450 --> 00:07:21.160
 rivaner and on the other there is here 

00:07:18.940 --> 00:07:22.690
 still my video around the view more accurate 

00:07:21.160 --> 00:07:25.210
 said to the rumors whether the console 

00:07:22.690 --> 00:07:25.930
 soon the temporal blessing or just 

00:07:25.210 --> 00:07:27.550
 Not 

00:07:25.930 --> 00:07:28.750
 and in the middle as always there is the 

00:07:27.550 --> 00:07:30.550
 subscribe -button you press 

00:07:28.750 --> 00:07:33.220
 if you do not have any videos in the future 

00:07:30.550 --> 00:07:36.820
 to miss from us so to conclusion 

00:07:33.220 --> 00:07:41.590
 another prognosis from the glass globe 

00:07:36.820 --> 00:07:45.280
 glass of glass question mark box the new one 

00:07:41.590 --> 00:07:48.130
 zelda will be released at the same time for view and 

00:07:45.280 --> 00:07:51.430
 nx or a week offset exactly how 

00:07:48.130 --> 00:07:52.060
 twilight princess the question mark blog 

00:07:51.430 --> 00:07:54.930
 has spoken 

00:07:52.060 --> 00:07:54.930
 take care
