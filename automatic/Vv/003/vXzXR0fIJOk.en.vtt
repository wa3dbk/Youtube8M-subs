00:00:08.240 --> 00:00:11.880
 hello and welcome to gamer 

00:00:10.080 --> 00:00:13.769
 expressed in famous second zone and 

00:00:11.880 --> 00:00:15.870
 the excluding ps4 which should counteract 

00:00:13.769 --> 00:00:18.029
 the crazy fire power of fire on 

00:00:15.870 --> 00:00:19.619
 idboox one no wonder while the 

00:00:18.029 --> 00:00:21.300
 communication do not falter on this 

00:00:19.619 --> 00:00:22.920
 title there as a question session 

00:00:21.300 --> 00:00:23.430
 replies published on the playstation 

00:00:22.920 --> 00:00:25.680
 blog 

00:00:23.430 --> 00:00:27.570
 and that's brian fleming co founder of 

00:00:25.680 --> 00:00:29.369
 studio sucker punch and game producer 

00:00:27.570 --> 00:00:31.080
 who responded to the fans about 

00:00:29.369 --> 00:00:31.800
 seattle the city in which 

00:00:31.080 --> 00:00:33.360
 run the action 

00:00:31.800 --> 00:00:34.770
 it is to give more realism 

00:00:33.360 --> 00:00:36.780
 that she was taken as a model is 

00:00:34.770 --> 00:00:38.460
 reproduced in game must also say that 

00:00:36.780 --> 00:00:40.260
 that's where the developers live 

00:00:38.460 --> 00:00:42.059
 quoted will be animated but the behavior 

00:00:40.260 --> 00:00:43.890
 poor citizens witnessing your 

00:00:42.059 --> 00:00:46.020
 powers will be logically has 

00:00:43.890 --> 00:00:47.730
 spun take shelter about 

00:00:46.020 --> 00:00:49.530
 the effect of the powers precisely the studio 

00:00:47.730 --> 00:00:50.550
 particularly worked on 

00:00:49.530 --> 00:00:51.989
 destruction of some 

00:00:50.550 --> 00:00:53.670
 infrastructures that will be very 

00:00:51.989 --> 00:00:54.870
 impressive on-screen 

00:00:53.670 --> 00:00:56.730
 developers have made themselves 

00:00:54.870 --> 00:00:58.170
 fun with the different sets of 

00:00:56.730 --> 00:01:00.390
 accessible power to delsinne the 

00:00:58.170 --> 00:01:02.070
 main character and if we saw for 

00:01:00.390 --> 00:01:03.930
 the moment that smoke and electricity 

00:01:02.070 --> 00:01:05.939
 the powers of access will be well 

00:01:03.930 --> 00:01:08.250
 more numerous and varied and almost all 

00:01:05.939 --> 00:01:10.049
 ameliorable for karma and 

00:01:08.250 --> 00:01:11.580
 moral choices and player's decision 

00:01:10.049 --> 00:01:12.479
 will also affect some 

00:01:11.580 --> 00:01:14.310
 secondary characters 

00:01:12.479 --> 00:01:15.750
 of course we must expect 

00:01:14.310 --> 00:01:18.030
 changes of power but also 

00:01:15.750 --> 00:01:20.100
 appearance of the hero according to the 

00:01:18.030 --> 00:01:21.420
 behavior chosen by the player which 

00:01:20.100 --> 00:01:24.030
 should greatly enrich the 

00:01:21.420 --> 00:01:25.409
 replayability of the title brian fleming a 

00:01:24.030 --> 00:01:27.360
 confirmed that there will be no people 

00:01:25.409 --> 00:01:27.720
 multi nor of content created by 

00:01:27.360 --> 00:01:29.340
 players 

00:01:27.720 --> 00:01:30.479
 this assignment also gave him 

00:01:29.340 --> 00:01:31.950
 the opportunity to clarify that 

00:01:30.479 --> 00:01:34.259
 installation of the game requires 24 

00:01:31.950 --> 00:01:36.750
 July the space on the console then 

00:01:34.259 --> 00:01:39.119
 prepare your hoodie jacket your 

00:01:36.750 --> 00:01:40.860
 grunge hipster hat in famous 

00:01:39.119 --> 00:01:46.350
 second sound arrives on March 21st 

00:01:40.860 --> 00:01:49.619
 I knew of the rni always no no I do not 

00:01:46.350 --> 00:01:51.600
 will not cry the very loud but good ones 

00:01:49.619 --> 00:01:53.490
 Guess I warn you what I'm going 

00:01:51.600 --> 00:01:55.590
 announce you will be hard to hear 

00:01:53.490 --> 00:01:57.869
 on the official website of the studio cd 

00:01:55.590 --> 00:02:00.240
 projekt red an open letter has been 

00:01:57.869 --> 00:02:02.219
 published to explain the report of the 

00:02:00.240 --> 00:02:05.310
 witcher 3 in February 2015 

00:02:02.219 --> 00:02:08.899
 but go bad whining we are 

00:02:05.310 --> 00:02:08.899
 hunks of real hard-boobs 

00:02:09.840 --> 00:02:15.790
 good luck and here is another game of 

00:02:14.230 --> 00:02:18.609
 our list of the most anticipated titles 

00:02:15.790 --> 00:02:19.390
 of 2014 which ends up being postponed to 

00:02:18.609 --> 00:02:21.250
 next year 

00:02:19.390 --> 00:02:22.780
 this is of course for reasons of 

00:02:21.250 --> 00:02:24.069
 as much as those covered by the 

00:02:22.780 --> 00:02:25.659
 studio than expected by the 

00:02:24.069 --> 00:02:27.370
 players that the decision was made 

00:02:25.659 --> 00:02:28.959
 developers believe that 

00:02:27.370 --> 00:02:30.939
 a few more months offered 

00:02:28.959 --> 00:02:32.739
 this report will help to offer a 

00:02:30.939 --> 00:02:34.540
 role play an exceptional quality 

00:02:32.739 --> 00:02:35.859
 one of the best of the kind that 

00:02:34.540 --> 00:02:37.930
 will be ready to train you in 

00:02:35.859 --> 00:02:39.849
 dozens of hours of entertainment on 

00:02:37.930 --> 00:02:41.170
 studio of course apologizes to 

00:02:39.849 --> 00:02:43.060
 all players waiting for the title 

00:02:41.170 --> 00:02:44.290
 with passion but it's this type of 

00:02:43.060 --> 00:02:45.970
 decision that is necessary for 

00:02:44.290 --> 00:02:47.849
 to reach the limits 

00:02:45.970 --> 00:02:51.250
 previously defined by gender 

00:02:47.849 --> 00:02:52.599
 waited on pc ps catherine goxe one the 

00:02:51.250 --> 00:02:54.879
 witcher 3 is set in a world 

00:02:52.599 --> 00:02:55.870
 open which should be 20% larger 

00:02:54.879 --> 00:02:58.209
 than that of skyrim 

00:02:55.870 --> 00:02:59.590
 even if we understand the disappointed we hope 

00:02:58.209 --> 00:03:01.209
 also that this period will enable 

00:02:59.590 --> 00:03:01.750
 developers to avoid the famous crunch 

00:03:01.209 --> 00:03:03.340
 time 

00:03:01.750 --> 00:03:05.349
 and yes the crunch time is this 

00:03:03.340 --> 00:03:07.120
 work period at delusional hours 

00:03:05.349 --> 00:03:09.010
 who is then totally the teams for 

00:03:07.120 --> 00:03:11.019
 achieve at all costs to respect a 

00:03:09.010 --> 00:03:13.659
 release date sometimes fixed a little 

00:03:11.019 --> 00:03:15.790
 arbitrarily the first extension of 

00:03:13.659 --> 00:03:18.220
 diablo iii reaper of sound is expected 

00:03:15.790 --> 00:03:19.870
 for March 25 a month that turns out 

00:03:18.220 --> 00:03:20.290
 decidedly well loaded in large 

00:03:19.870 --> 00:03:21.970
 exits 

00:03:20.290 --> 00:03:23.229
 today we are talking about a video 

00:03:21.970 --> 00:03:27.609
 devoted to the new class of 

00:03:23.229 --> 00:03:28.810
 the extension of crossing this video we 

00:03:27.609 --> 00:03:30.819
 explains that a long time ago a 

00:03:28.810 --> 00:03:32.799
 order of holy warriors uncrossed so 

00:03:30.819 --> 00:03:34.449
 his party on a mission in an area 

00:03:32.799 --> 00:03:36.579
 swamp in the east of the world of 

00:03:34.449 --> 00:03:38.220
 sanctuary and since then we have not 

00:03:36.579 --> 00:03:40.720
 never again saw their solemn vow 

00:03:38.220 --> 00:03:42.400
 find a solution to save the time 

00:03:40.720 --> 00:03:45.099
 two hakas rom that was corrupted by 

00:03:42.400 --> 00:03:46.659
 Mephisto was drawn to the show 

00:03:45.099 --> 00:03:48.669
 the morning of the fall of the star / 

00:03:46.659 --> 00:03:50.739
 tristram a solitary crusader redone 

00:03:48.669 --> 00:03:52.209
 finally surface in the costs and 

00:03:50.739 --> 00:03:54.220
 Crusader's powers are nurtured by the 

00:03:52.209 --> 00:03:56.199
 wrath a source of energy that gets 

00:03:54.220 --> 00:03:57.849
 regenerates on a regular basis but that is 

00:03:56.199 --> 00:03:59.109
 also fed by the annihilation of 

00:03:57.849 --> 00:04:00.729
 his evil opponents 

00:03:59.109 --> 00:04:02.229
 they use particular techniques 

00:04:00.729 --> 00:04:04.569
 linked to his shield and to the light 

00:04:02.229 --> 00:04:06.129
 divine the cross may also challenge 

00:04:04.569 --> 00:04:08.169
 the monsters to force them to attacked 

00:04:06.129 --> 00:04:10.389
 or stuck on the spot thanks to 

00:04:08.169 --> 00:04:12.009
 his power of judgment he will also 

00:04:10.389 --> 00:04:13.239
 a source of beef or improvements 

00:04:12.009 --> 00:04:15.579
 for his fellow combatants 

00:04:13.239 --> 00:04:17.500
 besides this new class diablo iii 

00:04:15.579 --> 00:04:19.239
 will get rich with leopard balance of a 

00:04:17.500 --> 00:04:21.099
 new act of an adventure mode of a 

00:04:19.239 --> 00:04:22.810
 new mystical craftsman and of course 

00:04:21.099 --> 00:04:24.099
 new enemies and objects with the 

00:04:22.810 --> 00:04:26.050
 new systems of newsletters and 

00:04:24.099 --> 00:04:27.520
 paragon already in place and the disappearance 

00:04:26.050 --> 00:04:28.180
 of the auction house scheduled for the 

00:04:27.520 --> 00:04:30.279
 March 18 

00:04:28.180 --> 00:04:34.260
 that should convince more 

00:04:30.279 --> 00:04:36.370
 of one to resume the demon hunt 

00:04:34.260 --> 00:04:38.740
 and the question of the day comes from 

00:04:36.370 --> 00:04:40.630
 michael who bought a ps4 and who 

00:04:38.740 --> 00:04:42.279
 wait for whom finally we continue to 

00:04:40.630 --> 00:04:44.830
 do it since the release of the console 

00:04:42.279 --> 00:04:46.029
 so it's like this hub the weather it 

00:04:44.830 --> 00:04:47.380
 wait what it is like us there 

00:04:46.029 --> 00:04:48.880
 would wait for club that sony had announced 

00:04:47.380 --> 00:04:49.810
 as one of the first titles unveiled 

00:04:48.880 --> 00:04:51.669
 for the ps4 

00:04:49.810 --> 00:04:53.380
 but you know the game has been 

00:04:51.669 --> 00:04:54.969
 several times pushed back to such an extent that 

00:04:53.380 --> 00:04:56.770
 michael has completely cracked they 

00:04:54.969 --> 00:04:58.029
 ask 'is drake club is in 

00:04:56.770 --> 00:05:00.550
 train to become a wolf club 

00:04:58.029 --> 00:05:01.779
 so hi michael was sorry to see that 

00:05:00.550 --> 00:05:04.539
 you start a little farted the sinkers 

00:05:01.779 --> 00:05:05.889
 but you're not really wrong then that 

00:05:04.539 --> 00:05:07.210
 sony had introduced us the game in a 

00:05:05.889 --> 00:05:09.010
 playable version at gamescom 

00:05:07.210 --> 00:05:10.479
 we thought the club strike out 

00:05:09.010 --> 00:05:12.849
 would only be a matter of weeks 

00:05:10.479 --> 00:05:14.740
 but not at all according to the last 

00:05:12.849 --> 00:05:16.389
 information supplied by Sony it seems that 

00:05:14.740 --> 00:05:16.930
 clubs and even to snap the march 

00:05:16.389 --> 00:05:18.849
 back 

00:05:16.930 --> 00:05:20.680
 indeed scott rohde from sony america 

00:05:18.849 --> 00:05:23.260
 indicates that the development of the title 

00:05:20.680 --> 00:05:25.330
 been chaotic and that even though this one 

00:05:23.260 --> 00:05:27.190
 is well advanced the result is not 

00:05:25.330 --> 00:05:28.810
 really satisfying it would have been 

00:05:27.190 --> 00:05:30.400
 decided to squarely go back to the board 

00:05:28.810 --> 00:05:31.870
 in drawing in other words to review 

00:05:30.400 --> 00:05:34.089
 all the game since its conception 

00:05:31.870 --> 00:05:35.650
 initial then we do not know if all this 

00:05:34.089 --> 00:05:37.750
 that was done went to the trash 

00:05:35.650 --> 00:05:40.180
 but one thing is certain is that we are 

00:05:37.750 --> 00:05:41.650
 not ready to play dref club morals 

00:05:40.180 --> 00:05:44.110
 expressly it's over for today 

00:05:41.650 --> 00:05:46.560
 will meet again tomorrow and by then you are 

00:05:44.110 --> 00:05:46.560
 better
