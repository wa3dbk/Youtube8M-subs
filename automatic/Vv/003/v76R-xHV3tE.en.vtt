00:00:57.170 --> 00:00:57.180 
what some of the parameters are we can

00:00:57.180 --> 00:00:59.150 
what some of the parameters are we can
go<00:00:57.329> into<00:00:57.539> and<00:00:58.050> start<00:00:58.289> feeding<00:00:58.530> that<00:00:58.770> into<00:00:59.039> our

00:00:59.150 --> 00:00:59.160 
go into and start feeding that into our

00:00:59.160 --> 00:01:04.219 
go into and start feeding that into our
computer<00:00:59.699> models<00:01:00.620> once<00:01:01.620> we<00:01:01.800> see<00:01:03.080> some<00:01:04.080> of<00:01:04.110> the

00:01:04.219 --> 00:01:04.229 
computer models once we see some of the

models and CFD that kind of stuff then

00:01:07.229 --> 00:01:10.039 
models and CFD that kind of stuff then
we'll<00:01:07.920> start<00:01:08.460> pushing<00:01:09.000> towards<00:01:09.510> the<00:01:09.600> blue

00:01:10.039 --> 00:01:10.049 
we'll start pushing towards the blue

know what goes into a Mustang a lot of

00:01:22.590 --> 00:01:24.020 
know what goes into a Mustang a lot of
people<00:01:22.830> have<00:01:22.920> said<00:01:23.040> it's<00:01:23.220> too<00:01:23.430> good<00:01:23.640> to<00:01:23.700> make

00:01:24.020 --> 00:01:24.030 
people have said it's too good to make
