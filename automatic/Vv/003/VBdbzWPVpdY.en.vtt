hi<00:00:01.020> mark<00:00:01.350> safe<00:00:01.530> here<00:00:01.680> again<00:00:01.890> if<00:00:02.429> flopping<00:00:03.210> is

00:00:03.350 --> 00:00:03.360 
hi mark safe here again if flopping is

00:00:03.360 --> 00:00:05.869 
hi mark safe here again if flopping is
set<00:00:03.600> in<00:00:03.810> position<00:00:04.560> is<00:00:04.770> a<00:00:04.830> very<00:00:05.069> good<00:00:05.580> thing

00:00:05.869 --> 00:00:05.879 
set in position is a very good thing

00:00:05.879 --> 00:00:08.000 
set in position is a very good thing
then<00:00:06.480> it<00:00:06.600> stands<00:00:06.870> to<00:00:06.990> reason<00:00:07.109> that<00:00:07.470> flopping

00:00:08.000 --> 00:00:08.010 
then it stands to reason that flopping

00:00:08.010 --> 00:00:10.430 
then it stands to reason that flopping
either<00:00:08.280> a<00:00:08.460> straight<00:00:08.880> or<00:00:09.120> a<00:00:09.150> flush<00:00:09.269> in<00:00:09.840> position

00:00:10.430 --> 00:00:10.440 
either a straight or a flush in position

00:00:10.440 --> 00:00:13.339 
either a straight or a flush in position
can<00:00:10.980> be<00:00:11.130> even<00:00:11.460> better<00:00:11.960> especially<00:00:12.960> when<00:00:13.230> you

00:00:13.339 --> 00:00:13.349 
can be even better especially when you

00:00:13.349 --> 00:00:16.099 
can be even better especially when you
maximize<00:00:13.889> your<00:00:14.099> return<00:00:14.460> on<00:00:14.700> the<00:00:14.969> hand<00:00:15.210> in<00:00:15.450> our

00:00:16.099 --> 00:00:16.109
