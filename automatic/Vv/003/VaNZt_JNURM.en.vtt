00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:01.359
 the show 

00:00:01.359 --> 00:00:03.090
 I have focused on one 

00:00:03.090 --> 00:00:07.330
 for the reason or for two reasons one because they told me that a lateral the 

00:00:07.330 --> 00:00:08.259
 taste that 

00:00:08.259 --> 00:00:09.779
 lopez ariza that 

00:00:09.779 --> 00:00:12.019
 coke is also the senators 

00:00:12.019 --> 00:00:15.019
 and two because it's free software 

00:00:15.809 --> 00:00:20.630
 thank god not only the music cd public under licenses that does not cost a 

00:00:20.630 --> 00:00:23.630
 hard to the people who use it as long as it has commercial purposes 

00:00:24.230 --> 00:00:25.210
 and that was it 

00:00:25.210 --> 00:00:27.640
 and other things kosovo also 

00:00:27.640 --> 00:00:28.970
 gestha posted 

00:00:28.970 --> 00:00:32.159
 with licenses that allows you to use the program 

00:00:32.159 --> 00:00:35.639
 I know that when those companies are there they benefit from that game and also 

00:00:35.639 --> 00:00:38.810
 there is a series of surveys and what the openoffice is 

00:00:38.810 --> 00:00:40.310
 what he is 

00:00:40.310 --> 00:00:41.879
 the wasps except what I mean 

00:00:41.879 --> 00:00:43.130
 Well, now that's it 

00:00:43.130 --> 00:00:45.430
 brito quite complete 

00:00:45.430 --> 00:00:47.490
 and instead of why 

00:00:47.490 --> 00:00:49.630
 because it is a 

00:00:49.630 --> 00:00:50.910
 marí tur multitrack 

00:00:50.910 --> 00:00:53.700
 multitrack tiblisi 

00:00:53.700 --> 00:00:55.640
 not if we 

00:00:55.640 --> 00:00:56.640
 like us 

00:00:56.640 --> 00:00:59.640
 when a technician assemble coins 

00:01:00.160 --> 00:01:03.010
 imagine you were operating in the English court 

00:01:03.010 --> 00:01:05.610
 in 3d engraver clarified in the gala 

00:01:05.610 --> 00:01:06.620
 these crimes 

00:01:06.620 --> 00:01:08.010
 I have a piece 

00:01:08.010 --> 00:01:09.470
 we are in mourning 

00:01:09.470 --> 00:01:11.380
 I understand that it is music 

00:01:11.380 --> 00:01:13.270
 minutes after an effect 

00:01:13.270 --> 00:01:16.770
 they all followed more wounds caused as blocks of waves 

00:01:16.770 --> 00:01:17.479
 placed 

00:01:17.479 --> 00:01:19.060
 anyway the continuous 

00:01:19.060 --> 00:01:20.540
 seabass seeing it like that 

00:01:20.540 --> 00:01:24.170
 it reproduces and they are curia natural form but good has its trick 

00:01:24.170 --> 00:01:27.740
 what happens that he sees it so the record in 2007 is that after the idiots' 

00:01:27.740 --> 00:01:28.490
 wrong 

00:01:28.490 --> 00:01:31.370
 the penalty of a fine of 9 euros is 159 euros 

00:01:31.370 --> 00:01:34.620
 What you can not do is start to bear fruit from scratch 

00:01:34.620 --> 00:01:37.730
 with which and that is motivated this means that you have several channels 

00:01:37.730 --> 00:01:39.870
 where to place people 

00:01:39.870 --> 00:01:43.710
 that you want to get an effect and here the music will sound all the time 

00:01:43.710 --> 00:01:46.980
 because this is sweeping it and I am sure that it will be found in this view in this 

00:01:46.980 --> 00:01:48.090
 gesta of this one 

00:01:48.090 --> 00:01:50.940
 the club and aiming everything in time 

00:01:50.940 --> 00:01:53.200
 will be adding all sequentially 

00:01:53.200 --> 00:01:54.450
 with which 

00:01:54.450 --> 00:01:57.819
 your place to have here a music of these but spoke this morning 

00:01:57.819 --> 00:02:00.910
 poetry but has put music of whatever 

00:02:00.910 --> 00:02:04.150
 how is the defense is very remarkable because it is a very low road covered it 

00:02:04.150 --> 00:02:06.590
 music in addition to this right-handed monkey 

00:02:06.590 --> 00:02:07.649
 but let's go 

00:02:07.649 --> 00:02:10.970
 what is made multitrack is that you can put things in 

00:02:10.970 --> 00:02:13.310
 different positions and then doing very cool things 

00:02:13.310 --> 00:02:14.759
 there are programs that are just 

00:02:14.759 --> 00:02:15.759
 juli track 

00:02:15.759 --> 00:02:19.269
 Say what you have on the tennis court isidro m avis him 

00:02:19.269 --> 00:02:21.619
 according to last January 

00:02:21.619 --> 00:02:23.149
 in 

00:02:23.149 --> 00:02:25.489
 steps number three and six in 12 

00:02:25.489 --> 00:02:28.489
 you have to undo all your depressive state but after doing 

00:02:29.769 --> 00:02:31.219
 programs that exist 

00:02:31.219 --> 00:02:33.029
 like san jorge 

00:02:33.029 --> 00:02:35.729
 It is also a single track that belong 

00:02:35.729 --> 00:02:39.479
 opas that every time negredo touched and I reported directly by horses 

00:02:41.019 --> 00:02:43.039
 the culé fans know if you want 

00:02:43.039 --> 00:02:46.339
 in the computer we have left material 

00:02:46.339 --> 00:02:49.449
 in the gazette kilos of the two he opened it 

00:02:49.449 --> 00:02:50.509
 and appears 

00:02:50.509 --> 00:02:51.599
 this battle 

00:02:51.599 --> 00:02:53.899
 that in principle very friendly bernales 

00:02:53.899 --> 00:02:57.049
 but no audio editor is not a monument 

00:02:57.049 --> 00:02:59.069
 prestes of the simplest 

00:02:59.069 --> 00:03:02.069
 you will see how I will open a file cared for working badly 

00:03:02.589 --> 00:03:06.029
 It means you can do the same thing and that's why I follow it like I'm going 

00:03:06.029 --> 00:03:06.779
 to do 

00:03:06.779 --> 00:03:09.009
 p on your computers 

00:03:09.009 --> 00:03:12.009
 your file defense 

00:03:12.609 --> 00:03:15.749
 it's already something 

00:03:15.749 --> 00:03:17.609
 and nothing happens 

00:03:17.609 --> 00:03:20.409
 What you really see done is create a new project 

00:03:20.409 --> 00:03:22.499
 although not cocaine 

00:03:22.499 --> 00:03:24.299
 every 

00:03:24.299 --> 00:03:26.679
 every 

00:03:26.679 --> 00:03:30.709
 the event will be ready I was about to sell sounds 

00:03:30.709 --> 00:03:33.039
 what to do a degree diego story 

00:03:33.039 --> 00:03:35.239
 a song or whatever 

00:03:35.239 --> 00:03:38.639
 I recited a joke full a project of a song I have 

00:03:38.639 --> 00:03:40.639
 voted projects 

00:03:40.639 --> 00:03:43.339
 but anyone who distinguishes it as a project 

00:03:43.339 --> 00:03:46.339
 percent indifferent to each other 

00:03:47.009 --> 00:03:47.830
 a file 

00:03:47.830 --> 00:03:50.059
 I'm going in 

00:03:50.059 --> 00:03:51.579
 the manager and 

00:03:51.579 --> 00:03:54.679
 and I say nothing matters 

00:03:54.679 --> 00:03:56.879
 you go to 

00:03:56.879 --> 00:03:59.069
 the folder that was left 

00:03:59.069 --> 00:04:01.039
 the huca network 

00:04:01.039 --> 00:04:05.429
 a country to rsf lamented is so the party and you take what you want 

00:04:07.719 --> 00:04:11.959
 larrys each one has in fish other than eta you like kilos view 

00:04:13.409 --> 00:04:14.939
 and that person 

00:04:14.939 --> 00:04:17.900
 sinaloa is the lawsuit piled up all 

00:04:17.900 --> 00:04:21.379
 if those lenses will sound 

00:04:21.379 --> 00:04:23.469
 ii a week ago 

00:04:23.469 --> 00:04:25.590
 efe 

00:04:25.590 --> 00:04:28.830
 says he moved good the exercise consisted 

00:04:29.870 --> 00:04:31.370
 I hope to put 

00:04:31.370 --> 00:04:34.199
 this is a section where you put news cuts from the previous day 

00:04:34.199 --> 00:04:37.199
 It is broadcast at six fifteen in the morning and is collected at the audio level 

00:04:37.840 --> 00:04:40.249
 the most important news two 

00:04:40.249 --> 00:04:43.249
 the speaker expomar deloitte 

00:04:44.189 --> 00:04:48.110
 of presentation of the news and then to the cut of the politician or of the person 

00:04:48.110 --> 00:04:48.629
 what 

00:04:48.629 --> 00:04:51.059
 the protagonist of the news 

00:04:51.059 --> 00:04:52.389
 what will he ask for 

00:04:52.389 --> 00:04:53.819
 this quitarais 

00:04:53.819 --> 00:04:57.569
 the part of the voice cuts of what the announcer is not 

00:04:58.199 --> 00:04:59.460
 It is true that 

00:04:59.460 --> 00:05:02.449
 I only dismissed him if there were other expenses 

00:05:02.449 --> 00:05:05.499
 was to choose an area like I am choosing for sale 

00:05:06.610 --> 00:05:07.949
 the cucumbers 

00:05:07.949 --> 00:05:10.949
 country here to litigation 

00:05:13.909 --> 00:05:16.169
 if that is what you want 

00:05:16.169 --> 00:05:19.919
 what you want the police to put into effect whatever 

00:05:19.919 --> 00:05:21.139
 directly 

00:05:21.139 --> 00:05:22.400
 you will remember it 

00:05:22.400 --> 00:05:24.460
 for the fourth time 

00:05:24.460 --> 00:05:26.309
 and it is automatically cut 

00:05:26.309 --> 00:05:29.129
 what it has done to expedite a wave 

00:05:29.129 --> 00:05:31.659
 as you see the outer waves has two channels 

00:05:31.659 --> 00:05:34.580
 the riva you want the right down 

00:05:34.580 --> 00:05:38.819
 and breeding season sounds very weird because it's a cut that we love alan 

00:05:38.819 --> 00:05:42.279
 ended up in such as your milk 

00:05:42.279 --> 00:05:45.219
 electoral 

00:05:45.219 --> 00:05:46.809
 this is how it is mounted 

00:05:46.809 --> 00:05:49.490
 previously one 

00:05:49.490 --> 00:05:53.050
 a cut like this I hope mount a long time ago the only one I had was every 

00:05:53.050 --> 00:05:54.409
 track had the voice of announcer 

00:05:54.409 --> 00:05:57.379
 after being so different flavors 

00:05:57.379 --> 00:06:00.339
 it did not come out a very nice wave they talk 

00:06:00.339 --> 00:06:04.020
 a nice image of many tiny bands and that everything reproducing 

00:06:04.019 --> 00:06:05.909
 then all this comes out 

00:06:05.909 --> 00:06:06.889
 what happens that 

00:06:06.889 --> 00:06:11.370
 all this applied the music if for example on a canal orona track you have 

00:06:11.370 --> 00:06:13.129
 a cost hatillos 

00:06:13.129 --> 00:06:16.129
 the same on another tennis court 

00:06:16.629 --> 00:06:18.800
 none and character 

00:06:18.800 --> 00:06:21.039
 all together 3 15 

00:06:21.039 --> 00:06:24.289
 3 ves make up the song is with desire with which said that you can not 

00:06:24.289 --> 00:06:24.740
 do 

00:06:24.740 --> 00:06:27.339
 what I think you should do 

00:06:27.339 --> 00:06:31.019
 is that this program comes back home is still closed jc audio 

00:06:31.529 --> 00:06:33.779
 that there is not that house that you choose manual 

00:06:33.779 --> 00:06:35.999
 and it's a level and if percent e 

00:06:35.999 --> 00:06:39.289
 they are totally everything I am going to explain a little over what is the thing 

00:06:39.889 --> 00:06:45.070
 but you really know how to handle it because I'm 100% fast at 30 

00:06:45.069 --> 00:06:47.469
 percent this year percent of audio 

00:06:47.469 --> 00:06:50.539
 I could do 

00:06:50.539 --> 00:06:51.169
 very interesting thing
