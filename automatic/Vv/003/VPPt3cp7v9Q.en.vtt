00:01:13.700 --> 00:01:13.710 
this there's a curve right over here so

00:01:13.710 --> 00:01:15.200 
this there's a curve right over here so
the<00:01:13.799> problem<00:01:14.040> of<00:01:14.070> the<00:01:14.130> curve<00:01:14.400> is<00:01:14.549> that<00:01:14.580> unless

00:01:15.200 --> 00:01:15.210 
the problem of the curve is that unless

00:01:15.210 --> 00:01:16.580 
the problem of the curve is that unless
you're<00:01:15.360> installing<00:01:15.659> something<00:01:16.110> small<00:01:16.380> like<00:01:16.409> a

00:01:16.580 --> 00:01:16.590 
you're installing something small like a

00:01:16.590 --> 00:01:17.810 
you're installing something small like a
floor<00:01:16.830> just<00:01:17.070> be<00:01:17.220> clear<00:01:17.400> or<00:01:17.490> something<00:01:17.729> like

00:01:17.810 --> 00:01:17.820 
floor just be clear or something like

00:01:17.820 --> 00:01:18.800 
floor just be clear or something like
that<00:01:17.909> and<00:01:18.090> you<00:01:18.180> put<00:01:18.390> it<00:01:18.479> there

00:01:18.800 --> 00:01:18.810 
that and you put it there

00:01:18.810 --> 00:01:21.289 
that and you put it there
then<00:01:19.320> it's<00:01:19.920> not<00:01:20.159> gonna<00:01:20.400> it's<00:01:20.909> not<00:01:21.000> gonna<00:01:21.150> mount

00:01:21.289 --> 00:01:21.299 
then it's not gonna it's not gonna mount

00:01:21.299 --> 00:01:22.550 
then it's not gonna it's not gonna mount
properly<00:01:21.689> you<00:01:21.750> put<00:01:21.900> the<00:01:21.990> six<00:01:22.200> inch<00:01:22.350> speaker

00:01:24.530 --> 00:01:24.540 
it's gonna kind of sit where you mount

00:01:24.540 --> 00:01:25.999

00:01:25.999 --> 00:01:26.009 
it it's gonna twist and eventually it's

00:01:26.009 --> 00:01:27.710

know about that it will follow if you
mount<00:01:29.850> because<00:01:30.000> of<00:01:30.299> the<00:01:30.360> way<00:01:30.509> this<00:01:30.689> kind<00:01:30.869> of

00:01:30.980 --> 00:01:30.990 
mount because of the way this kind of

00:01:30.990 --> 00:01:32.960 
mount because of the way this kind of
smooths<00:01:31.229> or<00:01:31.470> anyone<00:01:32.100> owning<00:01:32.369> Grand<00:01:32.579> Prix<00:01:32.759> take

00:01:32.960 --> 00:01:32.970 
smooths or anyone owning Grand Prix take

00:01:32.970 --> 00:01:34.160 
smooths or anyone owning Grand Prix take
a<00:01:33.000> look<00:01:33.210> you'll<00:01:33.360> know<00:01:33.479> exactly<00:01:33.780> I<00:01:33.840> mean<00:01:34.049> when

00:01:34.160 --> 00:01:34.170 
a look you'll know exactly I mean when

00:01:34.170 --> 00:01:35.810 
a look you'll know exactly I mean when
you<00:01:34.229> feel<00:01:34.409> here<00:01:34.650> it<00:01:35.040> doesn't<00:01:35.220> come<00:01:35.460> straight

00:01:35.810 --> 00:01:35.820 
you feel here it doesn't come straight

00:01:35.820 --> 00:01:37.700 
you feel here it doesn't come straight
out<00:01:35.850> now<00:01:36.570> that<00:01:36.689> I<00:01:36.720> can<00:01:36.869> 90-degree<00:01:37.350> like<00:01:37.530> to<00:01:37.619> the

00:01:37.700 --> 00:01:37.710 
out now that I can 90-degree like to the

00:01:37.710 --> 00:01:39.530 
out now that I can 90-degree like to the
front<00:01:37.950> it<00:01:38.130> comes<00:01:38.340> it<00:01:38.610> kind<00:01:38.880> of<00:01:38.939> folds<00:01:39.210> down<00:01:39.479> and

00:01:39.530 --> 00:01:39.540 
front it comes it kind of folds down and

00:01:39.540 --> 00:01:41.780 
front it comes it kind of folds down and
inward<00:01:39.869> and<00:01:40.799> so<00:01:41.009> putting<00:01:41.220> the<00:01:41.310> speaker<00:01:41.610> there

00:01:41.780 --> 00:01:41.790 
inward and so putting the speaker there

00:01:41.790 --> 00:01:43.730 
inward and so putting the speaker there
it's<00:01:42.390> possible<00:01:42.899> but<00:01:43.049> it's<00:01:43.229> not<00:01:43.409> gonna<00:01:43.500> mount

00:01:43.730 --> 00:01:43.740 
it's possible but it's not gonna mount

00:01:43.740 --> 00:01:45.560 
it's possible but it's not gonna mount
probably<00:01:44.280> the<00:01:44.700> second<00:01:45.000> thing<00:01:45.119> is<00:01:45.180> I'd<00:01:45.270> look<00:01:45.450> in

00:01:45.560 --> 00:01:45.570 
probably the second thing is I'd look in

00:01:45.570 --> 00:01:46.999 
probably the second thing is I'd look in
the<00:01:45.689> back<00:01:45.840> and<00:01:46.110> there's<00:01:46.259> some<00:01:46.649> of<00:01:46.710> the<00:01:46.770> wiring

00:01:46.999 --> 00:01:47.009 
the back and there's some of the wiring

00:01:47.009 --> 00:01:49.910 
the back and there's some of the wiring
that<00:01:47.220> runs<00:01:47.280> in<00:01:47.640> here<00:01:48.079> runs<00:01:49.079> in<00:01:49.290> for<00:01:49.680> all<00:01:49.770> you

00:01:49.910 --> 00:01:49.920 
that runs in here runs in for all you

00:01:49.920 --> 00:01:51.020 
that runs in here runs in for all you
know<00:01:50.009> the<00:01:50.070> switch<00:01:50.280> everything<00:01:50.579> runs<00:01:50.729> and<00:01:50.909> runs

00:01:51.020 --> 00:01:51.030 
know the switch everything runs and runs

00:01:51.030 --> 00:01:52.580 
know the switch everything runs and runs
up<00:01:51.240> so<00:01:51.450> you<00:01:51.509> don't<00:01:51.630> have<00:01:51.840> a<00:01:51.869> lot<00:01:52.259> of<00:01:52.409> room<00:01:52.560> to

00:01:52.580 --> 00:01:52.590 
up so you don't have a lot of room to

00:01:52.590 --> 00:01:54.620 
up so you don't have a lot of room to
play<00:01:52.799> with<00:01:53.009> you<00:01:53.100> only<00:01:53.189> have<00:01:53.340> a<00:01:53.369> boat<00:01:53.579> there<00:01:54.360> so

00:01:54.620 --> 00:01:54.630 
play with you only have a boat there so

00:01:54.630 --> 00:01:56.569 
play with you only have a boat there so
which<00:01:54.780> can<00:01:54.960> fit<00:01:55.170> a<00:01:55.200> six-inch<00:01:55.590> speaker<00:01:55.979> but<00:01:56.490> it

00:01:56.569 --> 00:01:56.579 
which can fit a six-inch speaker but it

00:01:56.579 --> 00:01:58.880 
which can fit a six-inch speaker but it
only<00:01:56.790> gives<00:01:57.060> you<00:01:57.270> because<00:01:57.659> it's<00:01:58.110> so<00:01:58.350> thin<00:01:58.740> on

00:01:58.880 --> 00:01:58.890 
only gives you because it's so thin on

00:01:58.890 --> 00:02:02.810 
only gives you because it's so thin on
this<00:01:59.040> side<00:01:59.250> right<00:01:59.570> over<00:02:00.570> here<00:02:01.399> it<00:02:02.399> only<00:02:02.549> gives

00:02:02.810 --> 00:02:02.820 
this side right over here it only gives

00:02:02.820 --> 00:02:03.980 
this side right over here it only gives
you<00:02:03.030> a<00:02:03.060> little<00:02:03.270> bit<00:02:03.390> of<00:02:03.509> room<00:02:03.659> to<00:02:03.810> work<00:02:03.930> with

00:02:03.980 --> 00:02:03.990 
you a little bit of room to work with

00:02:03.990 --> 00:02:07.639 
you a little bit of room to work with
you<00:02:04.710> can<00:02:05.009> only<00:02:05.130> put<00:02:05.280> a<00:02:05.310> thin<00:02:06.270> mount<00:02:06.649> thin

00:02:07.639 --> 00:02:07.649 
you can only put a thin mount thin

00:02:07.649 --> 00:02:10.160 
you can only put a thin mount thin
speaker<00:02:08.550> of<00:02:08.640> the<00:02:08.700> thin<00:02:08.879> magnet<00:02:09.270> over<00:02:09.629> here

00:02:10.160 --> 00:02:10.170 
speaker of the thin magnet over here

00:02:10.170 --> 00:02:11.210 
speaker of the thin magnet over here
when<00:02:10.289> you<00:02:10.379> flush<00:02:10.560> them<00:02:10.739> out<00:02:10.770> that<00:02:10.920> you<00:02:11.009> can't

00:02:11.210 --> 00:02:11.220 
when you flush them out that you can't

00:02:11.220 --> 00:02:12.530 
when you flush them out that you can't
go<00:02:11.310> with<00:02:11.430> a<00:02:11.489> bigger<00:02:11.700> magnet<00:02:11.910> like

00:02:12.530 --> 00:02:12.540 
go with a bigger magnet like

00:02:12.540 --> 00:02:13.910 
go with a bigger magnet like
what<00:02:12.810> I<00:02:12.840> have<00:02:12.989> in<00:02:13.049> the<00:02:13.140> front<00:02:13.260> those<00:02:13.500> pioneers

00:02:13.910 --> 00:02:13.920 
what I have in the front those pioneers

00:02:13.920 --> 00:02:16.130 
what I have in the front those pioneers
you<00:02:14.519> can't<00:02:14.700> do<00:02:14.819> that<00:02:14.969> right<00:02:15.599> you<00:02:15.780> have<00:02:15.810> to<00:02:16.079> go

00:02:16.130 --> 00:02:16.140 
you can't do that right you have to go

00:02:16.140 --> 00:02:17.119 
you can't do that right you have to go
with<00:02:16.260> a<00:02:16.290> thin<00:02:16.500> making<00:02:16.829> it<00:02:16.950> when<00:02:17.040> you're

00:02:17.119 --> 00:02:17.129 
with a thin making it when you're

00:02:17.129 --> 00:02:19.490 
with a thin making it when you're
putting<00:02:17.280> it<00:02:17.459> here<00:02:17.489> so<00:02:18.200> there's<00:02:19.200> not<00:02:19.260> a<00:02:19.319> lot<00:02:19.349> to

00:02:19.490 --> 00:02:19.500 
putting it here so there's not a lot to

00:02:19.500 --> 00:02:20.750 
putting it here so there's not a lot to
cut<00:02:19.680> through<00:02:19.859> luckily<00:02:20.250> I'm<00:02:20.340> looking<00:02:20.579> back

00:02:20.750 --> 00:02:20.760 
cut through luckily I'm looking back

00:02:20.760 --> 00:02:21.890 
cut through luckily I'm looking back
there's<00:02:21.000> just<00:02:21.150> some<00:02:21.299> a<00:02:21.480> little<00:02:21.750> bit<00:02:21.840> of

00:02:21.890 --> 00:02:21.900 
there's just some a little bit of

00:02:21.900 --> 00:02:24.140 
there's just some a little bit of
material<00:02:22.200> not<00:02:22.560> a<00:02:22.590> lot<00:02:22.829> to<00:02:22.980> go<00:02:23.010> with<00:02:23.310> but<00:02:23.579> so<00:02:24.060> it

00:02:24.140 --> 00:02:24.150 
material not a lot to go with but so it

00:02:24.150 --> 00:02:26.089 
material not a lot to go with but so it
is<00:02:24.239> possible<00:02:24.540> but<00:02:25.049> it's<00:02:25.260> not<00:02:25.349> gonna<00:02:25.650> go<00:02:25.980> as

00:02:26.089 --> 00:02:26.099 
is possible but it's not gonna go as

00:02:26.099 --> 00:02:28.160 
is possible but it's not gonna go as
well<00:02:26.280> as<00:02:26.400> you<00:02:26.430> want<00:02:26.700> the<00:02:27.510> good<00:02:27.719> and<00:02:27.810> the<00:02:27.870> bad<00:02:27.989> of

00:02:28.160 --> 00:02:28.170 
well as you want the good and the bad of

00:02:28.170 --> 00:02:29.569 
well as you want the good and the bad of
it<00:02:28.290> is<00:02:28.469> they<00:02:28.590> have<00:02:28.739> a<00:02:28.769> boot<00:02:29.040> here<00:02:29.220> which<00:02:29.340> is<00:02:29.459> the

00:02:29.569 --> 00:02:29.579 
it is they have a boot here which is the

00:02:29.579 --> 00:02:31.610 
it is they have a boot here which is the
best<00:02:29.760> place<00:02:29.970> to<00:02:30.000> run<00:02:30.299> your<00:02:30.450> wire<00:02:30.629> through<00:02:30.659> but

00:02:31.610 --> 00:02:31.620 
best place to run your wire through but

00:02:31.620 --> 00:02:33.410 
best place to run your wire through but
it's<00:02:31.739> a<00:02:31.829> sealed<00:02:32.099> boot<00:02:32.340> right<00:02:32.939> you<00:02:33.090> so<00:02:33.209> you<00:02:33.299> have

00:02:33.410 --> 00:02:33.420 
it's a sealed boot right you so you have

00:02:33.420 --> 00:02:35.240 
it's a sealed boot right you so you have
to<00:02:33.510> pull<00:02:33.720> this<00:02:33.870> out<00:02:34.049> and<00:02:34.349> it<00:02:34.739> is<00:02:34.769> gonna<00:02:34.950> be<00:02:35.069> like

00:02:35.240 --> 00:02:35.250 
to pull this out and it is gonna be like

00:02:35.250 --> 00:02:37.190 
to pull this out and it is gonna be like
a<00:02:35.280> little<00:02:35.549> bit<00:02:35.819> of<00:02:35.849> a<00:02:36.090> plug<00:02:36.540> inside<00:02:36.870> there<00:02:37.079> that

00:02:37.190 --> 00:02:37.200 
a little bit of a plug inside there that

00:02:37.200 --> 00:02:38.390 
a little bit of a plug inside there that
connects<00:02:37.560> all<00:02:37.650> the<00:02:37.799> wiring<00:02:37.980> this<00:02:38.220> is<00:02:38.340> a

00:02:38.390 --> 00:02:38.400 
connects all the wiring this is a

00:02:38.400 --> 00:02:40.429 
connects all the wiring this is a
wireless<00:02:38.790> switch<00:02:39.000> and<00:02:39.180> so<00:02:39.299> on<00:02:39.420> so<00:02:39.989> you'd<00:02:40.379> have

00:02:40.429 --> 00:02:40.439 
wireless switch and so on so you'd have

00:02:40.439 --> 00:02:43.580 
wireless switch and so on so you'd have
to<00:02:40.590> look<00:02:40.799> at<00:02:40.920> that<00:02:41.040> as<00:02:41.189> well<00:02:41.989> you<00:02:42.989> can<00:02:43.230> run<00:02:43.469> the

00:02:43.580 --> 00:02:43.590 
to look at that as well you can run the

00:02:43.590 --> 00:02:45.140 
to look at that as well you can run the
wire<00:02:43.709> through<00:02:43.739> you<00:02:44.129> may<00:02:44.219> have<00:02:44.340> to<00:02:44.430> drill<00:02:44.760> like

00:02:45.140 --> 00:02:45.150 
wire through you may have to drill like

00:02:45.150 --> 00:02:46.309 
wire through you may have to drill like
you<00:02:45.239> take<00:02:45.420> the<00:02:45.540> boot<00:02:45.720> out<00:02:45.840> and<00:02:46.079> then<00:02:46.170> you<00:02:46.230> have

00:02:46.309 --> 00:02:46.319 
you take the boot out and then you have

00:02:46.319 --> 00:02:47.750 
you take the boot out and then you have

wire through if you guys decide to do it
don't<00:02:50.549> make<00:02:51.120> this<00:02:51.299> wire<00:02:51.510> too<00:02:51.840> tents<00:02:52.349> make<00:02:52.500> sure

you leave some play in here so when the

don't just make it you know fit there
you<00:03:02.579> have<00:03:02.669> to<00:03:02.760> make<00:03:02.879> sure<00:03:02.909> you<00:03:03.090> leave<00:03:03.239> some

I definitely do not recommend that I

00:03:18.110 --> 00:03:18.120 
recommend running a separate amp small

00:03:18.120 --> 00:03:19.759

00:03:21.649 --> 00:03:21.659 
you decide to do it and won't take much

00:03:21.659 --> 00:03:22.939 
you decide to do it and won't take much
especially<00:03:22.229> you're<00:03:22.379> installing<00:03:22.590> a<00:03:22.799> system

00:03:22.939 --> 00:03:22.949 
especially you're installing a system

00:03:22.949 --> 00:03:24.619 
especially you're installing a system
earlier<00:03:23.280> than<00:03:23.430> that<00:03:23.609> it's<00:03:24.150> all<00:03:24.269> a<00:03:24.299> separate

00:03:24.619 --> 00:03:24.629 
earlier than that it's all a separate

earlier than that it's all a separate
smaller<00:03:24.930> amp<00:03:25.139> and<00:03:25.349> run<00:03:25.500> the<00:03:25.739> the<00:03:26.280> rear

00:03:26.420 --> 00:03:26.430 
smaller amp and run the the rear

00:03:26.430 --> 00:03:28.129 
smaller amp and run the the rear
speakers<00:03:26.819> off<00:03:26.970> of<00:03:27.120> that<00:03:27.329> it'll<00:03:27.840> be<00:03:27.930> a<00:03:27.959> much

00:03:28.129 --> 00:03:28.139 
speakers off of that it'll be a much

00:03:28.139 --> 00:03:30.140 
speakers off of that it'll be a much
easier<00:03:28.169> setup<00:03:28.799> and<00:03:29.040> it'll<00:03:29.639> be<00:03:29.699> cleaner<00:03:29.970> and

00:03:30.140 --> 00:03:30.150 
easier setup and it'll be cleaner and

00:03:30.150 --> 00:03:32.030 
easier setup and it'll be cleaner and
then<00:03:30.389> you<00:03:30.479> just<00:03:30.629> hook<00:03:30.750> it<00:03:30.780> into<00:03:31.019> your<00:03:31.409> private

00:03:32.030 --> 00:03:32.040 
then you just hook it into your private

00:03:32.040 --> 00:03:33.559 
then you just hook it into your private
your<00:03:32.250> existing<00:03:32.639> system<00:03:33.000> or<00:03:33.180> you<00:03:33.269> run<00:03:33.359> it<00:03:33.449> off

00:03:33.559 --> 00:03:33.569 
your existing system or you run it off

00:03:33.569 --> 00:03:34.969 
your existing system or you run it off
for<00:03:33.720> our<00:03:33.810> CAS<00:03:34.139> if<00:03:34.319> you<00:03:34.470> get<00:03:34.739> it<00:03:34.799> put<00:03:34.919> an

00:03:34.969 --> 00:03:34.979 
for our CAS if you get it put an

00:03:34.979 --> 00:03:36.080 
for our CAS if you get it put an
aftermarket<00:03:35.250> deck<00:03:35.549> which<00:03:35.699> I<00:03:35.790> hope<00:03:35.909> you're

00:03:36.080 --> 00:03:36.090 
aftermarket deck which I hope you're

00:03:36.090 --> 00:03:38.890 
aftermarket deck which I hope you're
doing<00:03:36.409> and<00:03:37.409> you<00:03:38.040> just<00:03:38.159> go<00:03:38.310> from<00:03:38.430> there

00:03:38.890 --> 00:03:38.900 
doing and you just go from there

00:03:38.900 --> 00:03:41.750 
doing and you just go from there
so<00:03:39.900> the<00:03:40.409> question<00:03:40.949> of<00:03:41.040> course<00:03:41.190> is<00:03:41.310> mounting<00:03:41.639> it

00:03:41.750 --> 00:03:41.760 
so the question of course is mounting it

00:03:41.760 --> 00:03:43.219 
so the question of course is mounting it
up<00:03:41.970> here<00:03:42.239> if<00:03:42.389> you're<00:03:42.540> putting<00:03:42.720> like<00:03:42.810> tweeters

00:03:43.219 --> 00:03:43.229 
up here if you're putting like tweeters

00:03:43.229 --> 00:03:44.750 
up here if you're putting like tweeters
or<00:03:43.500> small<00:03:43.739> 4-inch<00:03:44.250> speaker<00:03:44.579> or<00:03:44.639> something

00:03:44.750 --> 00:03:44.760 
or small 4-inch speaker or something

00:03:44.760 --> 00:03:47.149 
or small 4-inch speaker or something
again<00:03:45.540> it's<00:03:45.690> possible<00:03:45.900> but<00:03:46.319> this<00:03:46.409> is<00:03:46.470> really

00:03:47.149 --> 00:03:47.159 
again it's possible but this is really

00:03:47.159 --> 00:03:48.979 
again it's possible but this is really
really<00:03:47.370> thick<00:03:47.760> I<00:03:47.970> checked<00:03:48.419> in<00:03:48.510> the<00:03:48.540> back<00:03:48.720> there

00:03:48.979 --> 00:03:48.989 
really thick I checked in the back there

00:03:48.989 --> 00:03:50.599 
really thick I checked in the back there
there's<00:03:49.199> a<00:03:49.290> lot<00:03:49.500> of<00:03:49.650> material<00:03:50.129> a<00:03:50.159> lot<00:03:50.280> of<00:03:50.370> sound

00:03:50.599 --> 00:03:50.609 
there's a lot of material a lot of sound

00:03:50.609 --> 00:03:52.009 
there's a lot of material a lot of sound
deadening<00:03:50.970> material<00:03:51.030> and<00:03:51.569> a<00:03:51.599> lot<00:03:51.690> of<00:03:51.810> stuff

00:03:52.009 --> 00:03:52.019 
deadening material and a lot of stuff

00:03:52.019 --> 00:03:53.930 
deadening material and a lot of stuff
going<00:03:52.169> on<00:03:52.319> there<00:03:52.530> so<00:03:53.099> if<00:03:53.250> you<00:03:53.370> do<00:03:53.549> that<00:03:53.699> it's

00:03:53.930 --> 00:03:53.940 
going on there so if you do that it's

00:03:53.940 --> 00:03:55.429 
going on there so if you do that it's
gonna<00:03:54.000> be<00:03:54.120> a<00:03:54.150> lot<00:03:54.419> of<00:03:54.569> digging<00:03:54.900> through<00:03:55.109> and

00:03:55.429 --> 00:03:55.439 
gonna be a lot of digging through and

00:03:55.439 --> 00:03:58.670 
gonna be a lot of digging through and
because<00:03:56.099> this<00:03:56.280> is<00:03:56.430> being<00:03:57.030> over<00:03:57.269> here<00:03:57.680> hard

00:03:58.670 --> 00:03:58.680 
because this is being over here hard

00:03:58.680 --> 00:04:00.020 
because this is being over here hard
plastic<00:03:59.250> right<00:03:59.430> so<00:03:59.549> you<00:03:59.639> mount<00:03:59.819> the<00:03:59.909> speaker

00:04:00.020 --> 00:04:00.030 
plastic right so you mount the speaker

00:04:00.030 --> 00:04:02.330 
plastic right so you mount the speaker
it<00:04:00.479> whilst<00:04:00.720> it<00:04:00.930> has<00:04:01.079> better<00:04:01.290> this<00:04:01.560> thing<00:04:01.799> if

00:04:02.330 --> 00:04:02.340 
it whilst it has better this thing if

00:04:02.340 --> 00:04:04.280 
it whilst it has better this thing if
you<00:04:02.459> try<00:04:02.669> and<00:04:02.760> do<00:04:02.879> it<00:04:02.909> up<00:04:03.090> here<00:04:03.169> even<00:04:04.169> if<00:04:04.229> you

00:04:04.280 --> 00:04:04.290 
you try and do it up here even if you

00:04:04.290 --> 00:04:06.020 
you try and do it up here even if you
get<00:04:04.439> to<00:04:04.500> all<00:04:04.859> the<00:04:05.099> sound<00:04:05.669> deadening<00:04:05.879> material

00:04:06.020 --> 00:04:06.030 
get to all the sound deadening material

00:04:06.030 --> 00:04:07.939
