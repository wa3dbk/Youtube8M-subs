not going to make the whole scope again

00:00:35.610 --> 00:00:37.520 
not going to make the whole scope again
I'm<00:00:36.000> just<00:00:36.180> going<00:00:36.390> to<00:00:36.510> show<00:00:36.809> you<00:00:36.840> how<00:00:37.140> I<00:00:37.170> made<00:00:37.500> it

00:00:40.790 --> 00:00:40.800 
and like explain what everything is this

00:00:40.800 --> 00:00:43.880 
and like explain what everything is this
right<00:00:41.040> here<00:00:41.370> was<00:00:42.230> one<00:00:43.230> of<00:00:43.320> the<00:00:43.379> first<00:00:43.559> little

00:00:43.880 --> 00:00:43.890 
right here was one of the first little

00:00:43.890 --> 00:00:47.720 
right here was one of the first little
scopes<00:00:44.760> that<00:00:44.879> I<00:00:45.000> made<00:00:46.010> that's<00:00:47.010> the<00:00:47.160> pistol<00:00:47.550> and

00:00:47.720 --> 00:00:47.730 
scopes that I made that's the pistol and

00:00:47.730 --> 00:00:49.340 
scopes that I made that's the pistol and
I<00:00:47.789> just<00:00:47.969> made<00:00:48.149> this<00:00:48.270> little<00:00:48.570> red<00:00:48.719> dot<00:00:48.899> this

00:00:49.340 --> 00:00:49.350 
I just made this little red dot this

00:00:49.350 --> 00:00:52.389 
I just made this little red dot this
little<00:00:49.680> scope<00:00:50.010> that<00:00:50.280> goes<00:00:50.460> on<00:00:50.640> top<00:00:50.820> of<00:00:51.000> it<00:00:51.120> and

00:00:52.389 --> 00:00:52.399 
little scope that goes on top of it and

00:00:52.399 --> 00:00:55.010 
little scope that goes on top of it and
you<00:00:53.399> can<00:00:53.550> just<00:00:53.730> like<00:00:53.910> stick<00:00:54.570> that<00:00:54.719> on<00:00:54.840> with

00:00:55.010 --> 00:00:55.020 
you can just like stick that on with

00:00:55.020 --> 00:01:00.490 
you can just like stick that on with
tape<00:00:55.260> and<00:00:55.550> that<00:00:56.550> just<00:00:57.000> becomes<00:00:57.350> the<00:00:58.350> new<00:00:58.530> scope

00:01:00.490 --> 00:01:00.500 
tape and that just becomes the new scope

00:01:00.500 --> 00:01:02.750 
tape and that just becomes the new scope
so<00:01:01.500> I<00:01:01.530> just<00:01:01.800> made<00:01:01.949> that<00:01:02.100> just<00:01:02.309> for<00:01:02.430> fun<00:01:02.460> and

00:01:02.750 --> 00:01:02.760 
so I just made that just for fun and

00:01:02.760 --> 00:01:05.119 
so I just made that just for fun and
it's<00:01:02.969> not<00:01:03.059> very<00:01:03.510> well<00:01:03.629> made<00:01:03.840> so<00:01:04.080> how<00:01:04.890> you<00:01:04.949> make

00:01:05.119 --> 00:01:05.129 
it's not very well made so how you make

00:01:05.129 --> 00:01:09.080 
it's not very well made so how you make
this<00:01:05.309> is<00:01:05.369> basically<00:01:05.970> uh<00:01:06.119> you<00:01:07.040> take<00:01:08.040> some<00:01:08.909> paper

00:01:09.080 --> 00:01:09.090 
this is basically uh you take some paper

00:01:09.090 --> 00:01:11.480 
this is basically uh you take some paper
you<00:01:09.479> roll<00:01:09.689> it<00:01:09.840> into<00:01:09.960> a<00:01:10.080> tube<00:01:10.320> and<00:01:10.560> then<00:01:11.340> once

00:01:11.480 --> 00:01:11.490 
you roll it into a tube and then once

00:01:11.490 --> 00:01:15.380 
you roll it into a tube and then once
you<00:01:11.580> have<00:01:11.729> that<00:01:11.790> you<00:01:12.630> put<00:01:12.869> tape<00:01:13.080> over<00:01:14.150> one<00:01:15.150> end

00:01:15.380 --> 00:01:15.390 
you have that you put tape over one end

00:01:15.390 --> 00:01:18.020 
you have that you put tape over one end
of<00:01:15.479> it<00:01:15.600> and<00:01:16.040> on<00:01:17.040> that<00:01:17.340> tape<00:01:17.580> you<00:01:17.729> can<00:01:17.880> either

00:01:18.020 --> 00:01:18.030 
of it and on that tape you can either

00:01:18.030 --> 00:01:20.690 
of it and on that tape you can either
have<00:01:18.810> like<00:01:18.990> a<00:01:19.020> little<00:01:19.229> piece<00:01:19.590> of<00:01:19.770> paper<00:01:19.950> that's

stick that you can stick either a dot or
you<00:01:27.630> can<00:01:27.810> put<00:01:27.960> like<00:01:28.110> crosshairs<00:01:28.920> on<00:01:29.100> it<00:01:29.250> and

00:01:30.140 --> 00:01:30.150 
you can put like crosshairs on it and

00:01:30.150 --> 00:01:31.370 
you can put like crosshairs on it and
you<00:01:30.240> put<00:01:30.420> that<00:01:30.540> on<00:01:30.659> the<00:01:30.780> tape<00:01:30.960> and<00:01:31.140> then<00:01:31.229> you

00:01:31.370 --> 00:01:31.380 
you put that on the tape and then you

00:01:31.380 --> 00:01:33.859 
you put that on the tape and then you
stick<00:01:31.710> it<00:01:31.799> over<00:01:31.860> the<00:01:32.040> top<00:01:32.250> of<00:01:32.280> it<00:01:32.490> and<00:01:32.869> that's

00:01:33.859 --> 00:01:33.869 
stick it over the top of it and that's

00:01:33.869 --> 00:01:35.810 
stick it over the top of it and that's
how<00:01:33.990> you<00:01:34.079> make<00:01:34.350> a<00:01:34.380> basic<00:01:34.650> scope<00:01:35.100> then<00:01:35.520> you<00:01:35.640> just

00:01:35.810 --> 00:01:35.820 
how you make a basic scope then you just

00:01:35.820 --> 00:01:40.999 
how you make a basic scope then you just
make<00:01:35.970> some<00:01:36.360> little<00:01:38.060> like<00:01:39.060> a<00:01:39.299> piece<00:01:39.770> that<00:01:40.770> goes

00:01:40.999 --> 00:01:41.009 
make some little like a piece that goes

00:01:41.009 --> 00:01:44.389 
make some little like a piece that goes
on<00:01:41.610> the<00:01:41.850> bottom<00:01:42.000> like<00:01:42.329> that<00:01:42.360> and<00:01:42.689> then<00:01:43.399> using

00:01:44.389 --> 00:01:44.399 
on the bottom like that and then using

00:01:44.399 --> 00:01:46.450 
on the bottom like that and then using
that<00:01:44.549> you<00:01:44.970> can<00:01:45.119> just<00:01:45.299> attach<00:01:45.420> it<00:01:45.600> on<00:01:45.960> to<00:01:46.170> your

00:01:46.450 --> 00:01:46.460 
that you can just attach it on to your

00:01:46.460 --> 00:01:49.190 
that you can just attach it on to your
whatever<00:01:47.460> gun<00:01:47.759> you<00:01:47.850> want<00:01:48.000> so<00:01:48.810> that's<00:01:48.990> just<00:01:49.079> how

00:01:49.190 --> 00:01:49.200 
whatever gun you want so that's just how

00:01:49.200 --> 00:01:52.639 
whatever gun you want so that's just how
I<00:01:49.290> made<00:01:49.530> this<00:01:49.680> round<00:01:49.979> type<00:01:50.250> of<00:01:50.399> scope<00:01:51.350> this<00:01:52.350> red

00:01:52.639 --> 00:01:52.649 
I made this round type of scope this red

00:01:52.649 --> 00:01:58.719 
I made this round type of scope this red
dot<00:01:52.860> scope<00:01:54.140> is<00:01:55.140> one<00:01:55.500> that<00:01:55.799> I<00:01:56.009> made<00:01:56.369> for<00:01:57.119> my<00:01:57.320> mp5

00:01:58.719 --> 00:01:58.729 
dot scope is one that I made for my mp5

00:01:58.729 --> 00:02:06.209 
dot scope is one that I made for my mp5
which<00:01:59.729> is<00:02:00.090> right<00:02:00.899> here

00:02:06.209 --> 00:02:06.219 

00:02:06.219 --> 00:02:11.890 

it<00:02:07.219> also<00:02:07.399> has<00:02:07.640> a<00:02:07.670> silencer<00:02:08.209> on<00:02:08.239> it<00:02:08.679> so<00:02:10.599> this<00:02:11.599> red

00:02:11.890 --> 00:02:11.900 
it also has a silencer on it so this red

00:02:11.900 --> 00:02:15.940 
it also has a silencer on it so this red
dot<00:02:12.110> scope<00:02:13.569> goes<00:02:14.569> on<00:02:14.780> right<00:02:14.989> like<00:02:15.170> right<00:02:15.739> there

00:02:15.940 --> 00:02:15.950 
dot scope goes on right like right there

00:02:15.950 --> 00:02:18.580 
dot scope goes on right like right there
and<00:02:16.069> you<00:02:16.430> can<00:02:16.459> just<00:02:16.700> stick<00:02:16.849> it<00:02:16.970> on<00:02:17.030> and<00:02:17.410> you<00:02:18.410> can

00:02:18.580 --> 00:02:18.590 
and you can just stick it on and you can

00:02:18.590 --> 00:02:23.979 
and you can just stick it on and you can
use<00:02:18.860> that<00:02:19.130> as<00:02:20.060> a<00:02:20.239> scope<00:02:21.550> so<00:02:22.550> how<00:02:23.390> do<00:02:23.450> you<00:02:23.690> make

00:02:23.979 --> 00:02:23.989 
use that as a scope so how do you make

00:02:23.989 --> 00:02:28.890 
use that as a scope so how do you make
this<00:02:24.370> well<00:02:25.480> to<00:02:26.480> make<00:02:26.630> this<00:02:26.930> what<00:02:27.260> I<00:02:27.290> did<00:02:27.530> was<00:02:27.769> I

00:02:28.890 --> 00:02:28.900 
this well to make this what I did was I

00:02:28.900 --> 00:02:32.589 
this well to make this what I did was I
took<00:02:29.900> a<00:02:30.380> little<00:02:30.680> I<00:02:31.459> made<00:02:31.790> this<00:02:32.090> little<00:02:32.330> round

00:02:32.589 --> 00:02:32.599 
took a little I made this little round

00:02:32.599 --> 00:02:35.440 
took a little I made this little round
part<00:02:33.370> so<00:02:34.370> you<00:02:34.430> just<00:02:34.670> take<00:02:34.790> a<00:02:34.849> piece<00:02:35.180> of<00:02:35.209> paper

00:02:35.440 --> 00:02:35.450 
part so you just take a piece of paper

00:02:35.450 --> 00:02:37.870 
part so you just take a piece of paper
you<00:02:35.630> make<00:02:35.900> it<00:02:36.019> you<00:02:36.230> roll<00:02:36.470> it<00:02:36.620> up<00:02:36.709> and<00:02:37.580> then<00:02:37.790> you

00:02:37.870 --> 00:02:37.880 
you make it you roll it up and then you

00:02:37.880 --> 00:02:39.910 
you make it you roll it up and then you
take<00:02:38.090> you<00:02:38.599> tape<00:02:38.810> it<00:02:38.930> around<00:02:38.989> kind<00:02:39.709> of<00:02:39.860> like

00:02:39.910 --> 00:02:39.920 
take you tape it around kind of like

00:02:39.920 --> 00:02:42.130 
take you tape it around kind of like
this<00:02:40.280> and<00:02:40.580> then<00:02:41.269> you<00:02:41.390> just<00:02:41.420> like<00:02:41.720> up<00:02:41.870> that<00:02:42.019> in

00:02:42.130 --> 00:02:42.140 
this and then you just like up that in

00:02:42.140 --> 00:02:43.660 
this and then you just like up that in
half<00:02:42.290> and<00:02:42.560> you<00:02:42.709> use<00:02:42.860> the<00:02:43.010> bottom<00:02:43.310> part<00:02:43.489> of<00:02:43.519> that

00:02:43.660 --> 00:02:43.670 
half and you use the bottom part of that

00:02:43.670 --> 00:02:46.270 
half and you use the bottom part of that
then<00:02:44.569> I<00:02:44.690> just<00:02:44.870> stuck<00:02:45.200> some<00:02:45.440> more<00:02:45.650> a<00:02:45.680> piece<00:02:46.130> of

00:02:46.270 --> 00:02:46.280 
then I just stuck some more a piece of

00:02:46.280 --> 00:02:48.610 
then I just stuck some more a piece of
paper<00:02:46.430> along<00:02:46.760> this<00:02:46.940> side<00:02:47.180> I<00:02:47.420> put<00:02:48.049> two<00:02:48.260> on<00:02:48.290> other

00:02:48.610 --> 00:02:48.620 
paper along this side I put two on other

00:02:48.620 --> 00:02:52.059 
paper along this side I put two on other
side<00:02:48.950> and<00:02:49.720> one<00:02:50.720> piece<00:02:50.930> that<00:02:51.200> sticks<00:02:51.650> at<00:02:51.890> the

00:02:52.059 --> 00:02:52.069 
side and one piece that sticks at the

00:02:52.069 --> 00:02:54.880 
side and one piece that sticks at the
top<00:02:52.340> here<00:02:52.750> goes<00:02:53.750> along<00:02:54.049> that<00:02:54.260> and<00:02:54.470> then<00:02:54.769> it

00:02:54.880 --> 00:02:54.890 
top here goes along that and then it

00:02:54.890 --> 00:02:57.069 
top here goes along that and then it
just<00:02:55.010> goes<00:02:55.819> down<00:02:56.060> and<00:02:56.090> sticks<00:02:56.599> onto<00:02:56.750> the<00:02:56.900> body

00:02:57.069 --> 00:02:57.079 
just goes down and sticks onto the body

00:02:57.079 --> 00:02:58.900 
just goes down and sticks onto the body
a<00:02:57.170> bit<00:02:57.349> so<00:02:58.130> you<00:02:58.160> can<00:02:58.310> either<00:02:58.400> just<00:02:58.670> leave<00:02:58.819> it

00:02:58.900 --> 00:02:58.910 
a bit so you can either just leave it

00:02:58.910 --> 00:03:00.220 
a bit so you can either just leave it
like<00:02:58.940> this<00:02:59.060> or<00:02:59.390> else<00:02:59.480> you<00:02:59.630> can<00:02:59.780> tape<00:02:59.989> this<00:03:00.170> down

00:03:00.220 --> 00:03:00.230 
like this or else you can tape this down

00:03:00.230 --> 00:03:03.220 
like this or else you can tape this down
if<00:03:00.650> you<00:03:00.829> want<00:03:01.010> to<00:03:01.130> make<00:03:01.459> it<00:03:01.610> look<00:03:01.819> better<00:03:02.230> like

00:03:03.220 --> 00:03:03.230 
if you want to make it look better like

00:03:03.230 --> 00:03:05.259 
if you want to make it look better like
that<00:03:03.290> I<00:03:03.739> just<00:03:04.220> left<00:03:04.370> it<00:03:04.489> like<00:03:04.549> this<00:03:04.790> because<00:03:05.030> it

00:03:05.259 --> 00:03:05.269 
that I just left it like this because it

00:03:05.269 --> 00:03:08.410 
that I just left it like this because it
makes<00:03:05.480> it<00:03:05.599> look<00:03:05.660> cool<00:03:05.930> and<00:03:06.230> then<00:03:07.220> you<00:03:08.180> take

00:03:08.410 --> 00:03:08.420 
makes it look cool and then you take

00:03:08.420 --> 00:03:10.690 
makes it look cool and then you take
another<00:03:08.870> roll<00:03:09.620> of<00:03:09.650> paper<00:03:10.010> make<00:03:10.340> it<00:03:10.459> a<00:03:10.519> bit

00:03:10.690 --> 00:03:10.700 
another roll of paper make it a bit

00:03:10.700 --> 00:03:11.830 
another roll of paper make it a bit
bigger<00:03:10.850> this<00:03:11.510> time

00:03:11.830 --> 00:03:11.840 
bigger this time

00:03:11.840 --> 00:03:14.470 
bigger this time
and<00:03:11.930> then<00:03:12.890> once<00:03:13.430> you<00:03:13.579> have<00:03:13.790> the<00:03:13.970> tape<00:03:14.150> at<00:03:14.359> the

00:03:14.470 --> 00:03:14.480 
and then once you have the tape at the

00:03:14.480 --> 00:03:16.470 
and then once you have the tape at the
pieces<00:03:14.690> of<00:03:14.900> the<00:03:15.019> roll<00:03:15.170> of<00:03:15.290> paper<00:03:15.500> rolled<00:03:15.829> up

00:03:16.470 --> 00:03:16.480 
pieces of the roll of paper rolled up

00:03:16.480 --> 00:03:19.509 
pieces of the roll of paper rolled up
you<00:03:17.480> you<00:03:18.019> kind<00:03:18.230> of<00:03:18.290> like<00:03:18.440> fold<00:03:18.709> it<00:03:18.829> into<00:03:19.100> a<00:03:19.130> box

00:03:19.509 --> 00:03:19.519 
you you kind of like fold it into a box

00:03:19.519 --> 00:03:22.539 
you you kind of like fold it into a box
and<00:03:20.380> then<00:03:21.380> once<00:03:21.500> you<00:03:21.590> have<00:03:21.739> it<00:03:21.889> folded<00:03:22.040> a<00:03:22.310> box

00:03:22.539 --> 00:03:22.549 
and then once you have it folded a box

00:03:22.549 --> 00:03:24.009 
and then once you have it folded a box
you<00:03:22.700> tape<00:03:22.880> it<00:03:23.030> again<00:03:23.269> so<00:03:23.510> it<00:03:23.600> stays<00:03:23.840> in<00:03:23.989> that

00:03:24.009 --> 00:03:24.019 
you tape it again so it stays in that

00:03:24.019 --> 00:03:26.759 
you tape it again so it stays in that
shape<00:03:24.350> and<00:03:24.579> you<00:03:25.579> just<00:03:25.760> stick<00:03:25.940> that<00:03:26.090> box<00:03:26.299> on<00:03:26.480> top

00:03:26.759 --> 00:03:26.769 
shape and you just stick that box on top

00:03:26.769 --> 00:03:29.620 
shape and you just stick that box on top
then<00:03:27.769> you<00:03:27.799> put<00:03:28.190> some<00:03:28.370> tape<00:03:28.579> over<00:03:28.819> the<00:03:29.329> top<00:03:29.359> of

00:03:29.620 --> 00:03:29.630 
then you put some tape over the top of

00:03:29.630 --> 00:03:32.470 
then you put some tape over the top of
it<00:03:29.720> and<00:03:30.250> use<00:03:31.250> like<00:03:31.459> us<00:03:31.639> you<00:03:32.000> could<00:03:32.180> either<00:03:32.329> just

00:03:32.470 --> 00:03:32.480 
it and use like us you could either just

00:03:32.480 --> 00:03:34.949 
it and use like us you could either just
draw<00:03:33.200> on<00:03:33.440> here<00:03:33.680> with<00:03:33.920> like<00:03:34.130> a<00:03:34.190> marker<00:03:34.670> or

00:03:34.949 --> 00:03:34.959 
draw on here with like a marker or

00:03:34.959 --> 00:03:37.420 
draw on here with like a marker or
sharpie<00:03:35.959> or<00:03:35.989> something<00:03:36.380> just<00:03:36.739> uh<00:03:36.829> put<00:03:37.400> a

00:03:37.420 --> 00:03:37.430 
sharpie or something just uh put a

00:03:37.430 --> 00:03:40.539 
sharpie or something just uh put a
little<00:03:37.700> dot<00:03:37.970> or<00:03:38.180> crosshairs<00:03:38.690> on<00:03:38.840> it<00:03:39.340> in<00:03:40.340> this

00:03:40.539 --> 00:03:40.549 
little dot or crosshairs on it in this

00:03:40.549 --> 00:03:42.490 
little dot or crosshairs on it in this
case<00:03:40.790> I<00:03:41.180> took<00:03:41.420> a<00:03:41.630> small<00:03:41.750> piece<00:03:42.019> of<00:03:42.170> paper

00:03:42.490 --> 00:03:42.500 
case I took a small piece of paper

00:03:42.500 --> 00:03:44.440 
case I took a small piece of paper
I<00:03:42.709> colored<00:03:43.370> that<00:03:43.519> with<00:03:43.670> a<00:03:43.730> marker<00:03:44.090> and<00:03:44.209> then<00:03:44.329> I

00:03:44.440 --> 00:03:44.450 
I colored that with a marker and then I

00:03:44.450 --> 00:03:45.729 
I colored that with a marker and then I
just<00:03:44.600> stuck<00:03:44.840> it<00:03:44.870> onto<00:03:45.079> the<00:03:45.200> back<00:03:45.350> of<00:03:45.500> the<00:03:45.560> tape

00:03:45.729 --> 00:03:45.739 
just stuck it onto the back of the tape

00:03:45.739 --> 00:03:50.050 
just stuck it onto the back of the tape
which<00:03:45.980> is<00:03:46.100> still<00:03:46.340> sticky<00:03:46.670> and<00:03:47.829> then<00:03:48.829> I<00:03:49.370> just

00:03:50.050 --> 00:03:50.060 
which is still sticky and then I just

00:03:50.060 --> 00:03:53.110 
which is still sticky and then I just
put<00:03:50.239> that<00:03:50.359> on<00:03:50.480> the<00:03:50.569> back<00:03:50.780> and<00:03:51.819> there<00:03:52.819> you<00:03:52.850> go

00:03:53.110 --> 00:03:53.120 
put that on the back and there you go

00:03:53.120 --> 00:03:55.599 
put that on the back and there you go
you<00:03:53.569> have<00:03:53.780> a<00:03:53.810> red<00:03:54.139> dot<00:03:54.350> or<00:03:54.590> holographic<00:03:55.370> scope

00:03:55.599 --> 00:03:55.609 
you have a red dot or holographic scope

00:03:55.609 --> 00:03:59.309 
you have a red dot or holographic scope
depending<00:03:56.269> on<00:03:56.359> what<00:03:56.480> you<00:03:56.569> want<00:03:56.720> to<00:03:56.780> make<00:03:57.069> and

00:03:59.309 --> 00:03:59.319 
depending on what you want to make and

00:03:59.319 --> 00:04:03.509 
depending on what you want to make and
finally<00:04:00.319> we<00:04:00.980> have<00:04:01.099> the<00:04:01.250> sniper<00:04:01.519> rifle<00:04:01.880> scope

00:04:03.509 --> 00:04:03.519 
finally we have the sniper rifle scope

00:04:03.519 --> 00:04:06.309 
finally we have the sniper rifle scope
this<00:04:04.519> is<00:04:04.670> what<00:04:04.880> I<00:04:04.910> made<00:04:05.150> for<00:04:05.540> my<00:04:05.780> Arctic

00:04:06.309 --> 00:04:06.319 
this is what I made for my Arctic

00:04:06.319 --> 00:04:10.599 
this is what I made for my Arctic
warfare<00:04:06.590> sniper<00:04:07.280> rifle<00:04:09.099> go<00:04:10.099> check<00:04:10.310> that<00:04:10.459> video

00:04:10.599 --> 00:04:10.609 
warfare sniper rifle go check that video

00:04:10.609 --> 00:04:14.170 
warfare sniper rifle go check that video
out<00:04:10.760> if<00:04:11.000> you<00:04:11.090> want<00:04:12.250> so<00:04:13.250> how<00:04:13.400> you<00:04:13.459> make<00:04:13.790> this<00:04:13.970> as

00:04:14.170 --> 00:04:14.180 
out if you want so how you make this as

00:04:14.180 --> 00:04:16.509 
out if you want so how you make this as
you<00:04:15.049> make<00:04:15.229> one<00:04:15.470> long<00:04:15.739> roll

00:04:16.509 --> 00:04:16.519 
you make one long roll

00:04:16.519 --> 00:04:18.789 
you make one long roll
paper<00:04:16.729> and<00:04:17.060> you<00:04:17.840> have<00:04:17.989> that<00:04:18.199> for<00:04:18.440> the<00:04:18.590> middle

00:04:18.789 --> 00:04:18.799 
paper and you have that for the middle

00:04:18.799 --> 00:04:23.320 
paper and you have that for the middle
and<00:04:18.979> then<00:04:19.579> you<00:04:19.669> make<00:04:19.900> two<00:04:20.900> wider<00:04:22.150> rolls<00:04:23.150> of

00:04:23.320 --> 00:04:23.330 
and then you make two wider rolls of

00:04:23.330 --> 00:04:27.999 
and then you make two wider rolls of
paper<00:04:23.539> and<00:04:24.520> you<00:04:25.520> get<00:04:26.030> those<00:04:26.240> two<00:04:26.720> to<00:04:27.500> make<00:04:27.680> the

00:04:27.999 --> 00:04:28.009 
paper and you get those two to make the

00:04:28.009 --> 00:04:31.119 
paper and you get those two to make the
end<00:04:28.159> the<00:04:28.669> end<00:04:28.819> parts<00:04:29.120> of<00:04:29.270> this<00:04:29.889> then<00:04:30.889> what<00:04:31.039> you

00:04:31.119 --> 00:04:31.129 
end the end parts of this then what you

00:04:31.129 --> 00:04:36.040 
end the end parts of this then what you
do<00:04:31.250> is<00:04:31.280> you<00:04:33.039> you<00:04:34.039> basically<00:04:34.430> have<00:04:35.180> to<00:04:35.419> find<00:04:35.810> a

00:04:36.040 --> 00:04:36.050 
do is you you basically have to find a

00:04:36.050 --> 00:04:39.010 
do is you you basically have to find a
way<00:04:36.289> to<00:04:36.349> attach<00:04:36.889> though<00:04:37.250> the<00:04:38.240> big<00:04:38.509> part<00:04:38.780> on<00:04:38.870> to

00:04:39.010 --> 00:04:39.020 
way to attach though the big part on to

00:04:39.020 --> 00:04:40.779 
way to attach though the big part on to
the<00:04:39.080> small<00:04:39.289> part<00:04:39.500> so<00:04:39.650> what<00:04:39.860> I<00:04:39.919> did<00:04:40.039> here<00:04:40.400> was<00:04:40.430> I

00:04:40.779 --> 00:04:40.789 
the small part so what I did here was I

00:04:40.789 --> 00:04:43.149 
the small part so what I did here was I
use<00:04:40.940> like<00:04:41.150> a<00:04:41.180> piece<00:04:41.389> of<00:04:41.419> paper<00:04:41.720> and<00:04:41.960> just<00:04:42.949> just

00:04:43.149 --> 00:04:43.159 
use like a piece of paper and just just

00:04:43.159 --> 00:04:45.369 
use like a piece of paper and just just
long<00:04:43.550> strip<00:04:43.940> of<00:04:43.970> paper<00:04:44.240> I<00:04:44.539> put<00:04:44.750> it<00:04:44.840> between<00:04:45.020> the

00:04:45.369 --> 00:04:45.379 
long strip of paper I put it between the

00:04:45.379 --> 00:04:47.619 
long strip of paper I put it between the
two<00:04:45.560> and<00:04:45.800> I<00:04:46.280> taped<00:04:46.580> it<00:04:46.729> using<00:04:47.360> the<00:04:47.449> right

00:04:47.619 --> 00:04:47.629 
two and I taped it using the right

00:04:47.629 --> 00:04:50.559 
two and I taped it using the right
distance<00:04:47.990> and<00:04:48.259> then<00:04:49.039> you<00:04:49.190> just<00:04:49.370> like<00:04:49.569> bend

00:04:50.559 --> 00:04:50.569 
distance and then you just like bend

00:04:50.569 --> 00:04:52.089 
distance and then you just like bend
that<00:04:50.750> piece<00:04:50.990> of<00:04:51.139> paper<00:04:51.259> all<00:04:51.560> the<00:04:51.590> way<00:04:51.830> around

00:04:52.089 --> 00:04:52.099 
that piece of paper all the way around

00:04:52.099 --> 00:04:53.980 
that piece of paper all the way around
and<00:04:52.310> you<00:04:52.759> just<00:04:52.909> keep<00:04:53.060> taping<00:04:53.330> it<00:04:53.569> until<00:04:53.870> you

00:04:53.980 --> 00:04:53.990 
and you just keep taping it until you

00:04:53.990 --> 00:04:57.159 
and you just keep taping it until you
get<00:04:54.139> like<00:04:54.349> this<00:04:54.500> is<00:04:55.130> beveled<00:04:55.490> edge<00:04:56.030> so<00:04:56.930> it<00:04:56.990> goes

00:04:57.159 --> 00:04:57.169 
get like this is beveled edge so it goes

00:04:57.169 --> 00:04:58.689 
get like this is beveled edge so it goes
like<00:04:57.289> from<00:04:57.590> being<00:04:57.800> really<00:04:58.039> wide<00:04:58.220> to<00:04:58.430> really

00:04:58.689 --> 00:04:58.699 
like from being really wide to really

00:04:58.699 --> 00:05:00.850 
like from being really wide to really
narrow<00:04:58.849> and<00:04:59.120> it<00:05:00.110> just<00:05:00.259> narrows<00:05:00.530> down<00:05:00.590> like

00:05:00.850 --> 00:05:00.860 
narrow and it just narrows down like

00:05:00.860 --> 00:05:03.070 
narrow and it just narrows down like
that<00:05:00.979> and<00:05:01.099> you<00:05:01.159> just<00:05:01.190> put<00:05:01.430> tape<00:05:01.580> over<00:05:01.729> it<00:05:02.000> so<00:05:02.990> we

00:05:03.070 --> 00:05:03.080 
that and you just put tape over it so we

00:05:03.080 --> 00:05:06.129 
that and you just put tape over it so we
do<00:05:03.169> that<00:05:03.289> for<00:05:03.349> both<00:05:03.590> ends<00:05:03.919> and<00:05:04.090> then<00:05:05.090> I<00:05:05.419> you<00:05:05.900> end

00:05:06.129 --> 00:05:06.139 
do that for both ends and then I you end

00:05:06.139 --> 00:05:09.670 
do that for both ends and then I you end
up<00:05:06.319> with<00:05:06.789> something<00:05:07.789> like<00:05:08.150> this<00:05:08.500> so<00:05:09.500> what<00:05:09.650> I

00:05:09.670 --> 00:05:09.680 
up with something like this so what I

00:05:09.680 --> 00:05:13.390 
up with something like this so what I
did<00:05:09.800> for<00:05:10.370> this<00:05:10.580> end<00:05:10.880> of<00:05:11.270> this<00:05:11.840> was<00:05:12.199> uh<00:05:12.530> I<00:05:12.919> could

00:05:13.390 --> 00:05:13.400 
did for this end of this was uh I could

00:05:13.400 --> 00:05:15.010 
did for this end of this was uh I could
have<00:05:13.490> stopped<00:05:13.699> paper<00:05:13.969> on<00:05:14.150> it<00:05:14.300> but<00:05:14.479> that's<00:05:14.810> kind

00:05:15.010 --> 00:05:15.020 
have stopped paper on it but that's kind

00:05:15.020 --> 00:05:16.839 
have stopped paper on it but that's kind
of<00:05:15.080> hard<00:05:15.259> because<00:05:15.409> it's<00:05:16.129> already<00:05:16.460> way<00:05:16.669> at<00:05:16.759> the

00:05:16.839 --> 00:05:16.849 
of hard because it's already way at the

00:05:16.849 --> 00:05:18.520 
of hard because it's already way at the
end<00:05:16.969> you<00:05:17.509> could<00:05:17.629> do<00:05:17.780> that<00:05:17.900> before<00:05:18.020> you<00:05:18.259> tape<00:05:18.500> it

00:05:18.520 --> 00:05:18.530 
end you could do that before you tape it

00:05:18.530 --> 00:05:21.249 
end you could do that before you tape it
on<00:05:18.740> which<00:05:19.129> would<00:05:19.280> be<00:05:19.370> easier<00:05:19.810> but<00:05:20.810> what<00:05:20.990> I<00:05:21.020> did

00:05:21.249 --> 00:05:21.259 
on which would be easier but what I did

00:05:21.259 --> 00:05:24.610 
on which would be easier but what I did
for<00:05:21.469> this<00:05:21.590> was<00:05:21.919> I<00:05:22.219> just<00:05:22.460> uh<00:05:22.580> I<00:05:23.060> took<00:05:23.389> some<00:05:23.620> saran

00:05:24.610 --> 00:05:24.620 
for this was I just uh I took some saran

00:05:24.620 --> 00:05:27.790 
for this was I just uh I took some saran
wrap<00:05:24.830> or<00:05:24.949> some<00:05:25.819> cling<00:05:26.090> film<00:05:26.120> I<00:05:26.599> put<00:05:27.409> it<00:05:27.500> on<00:05:27.590> top

00:05:27.790 --> 00:05:27.800 
wrap or some cling film I put it on top

00:05:27.800 --> 00:05:31.089 
wrap or some cling film I put it on top
and<00:05:27.979> then<00:05:28.069> I<00:05:28.159> just<00:05:28.370> drew<00:05:29.030> on<00:05:29.180> it<00:05:29.330> with<00:05:29.539> uh<00:05:30.099> with

00:05:31.089 --> 00:05:31.099 
and then I just drew on it with uh with

00:05:31.099 --> 00:05:34.089 
and then I just drew on it with uh with
a<00:05:31.130> marker<00:05:31.460> to<00:05:31.699> give<00:05:32.330> that<00:05:32.630> Kenneth<00:05:32.930> back<00:05:33.139> so

00:05:34.089 --> 00:05:34.099 
a marker to give that Kenneth back so

00:05:34.099 --> 00:05:37.149 
a marker to give that Kenneth back so
then<00:05:34.279> when<00:05:34.430> you<00:05:34.460> look<00:05:34.729> down<00:05:35.029> the<00:05:35.270> scope<00:05:36.159> it

00:05:37.149 --> 00:05:37.159 
then when you look down the scope it

00:05:37.159 --> 00:05:39.129 
then when you look down the scope it
looks<00:05:37.340> like<00:05:37.520> we're<00:05:37.669> it's<00:05:37.789> not<00:05:37.909> rifle<00:05:38.270> then

00:05:39.129 --> 00:05:39.139 
looks like we're it's not rifle then

00:05:39.139 --> 00:05:41.170 
looks like we're it's not rifle then
once<00:05:39.349> you<00:05:39.440> have<00:05:39.590> that<00:05:39.770> basic<00:05:40.190> thing<00:05:40.400> uh<00:05:40.430> you

00:05:41.170 --> 00:05:41.180 
once you have that basic thing uh you

00:05:41.180 --> 00:05:42.999 
once you have that basic thing uh you
can<00:05:41.330> just<00:05:41.360> put<00:05:41.509> like<00:05:41.750> some<00:05:42.349> knobs<00:05:42.560> on<00:05:42.830> here

00:05:42.999 --> 00:05:43.009 
can just put like some knobs on here

00:05:43.009 --> 00:05:44.830 
can just put like some knobs on here
which<00:05:43.490> would<00:05:43.610> be<00:05:43.759> like<00:05:43.880> the<00:05:44.060> adjustment<00:05:44.630> knobs

00:05:44.830 --> 00:05:44.840 
which would be like the adjustment knobs

00:05:44.840 --> 00:05:50.320 
which would be like the adjustment knobs
to<00:05:45.219> let<00:05:46.219> calibrate<00:05:46.779> your<00:05:47.779> your<00:05:48.740> scope<00:05:49.330> then

00:05:50.320 --> 00:05:50.330 
to let calibrate your your scope then

00:05:50.330 --> 00:05:51.700 
to let calibrate your your scope then
you<00:05:50.539> just<00:05:50.719> fit<00:05:50.900> some<00:05:51.169> sort<00:05:51.409> of<00:05:51.469> mount

00:05:51.700 --> 00:05:51.710 
you just fit some sort of mount

00:05:51.710 --> 00:05:54.790 
you just fit some sort of mount
depending<00:05:52.610> on<00:05:52.729> how<00:05:52.940> how<00:05:53.870> this<00:05:54.080> attack<00:05:54.440> how<00:05:54.740> the

00:05:54.790 --> 00:05:54.800 
depending on how how this attack how the

00:05:54.800 --> 00:05:56.140 
depending on how how this attack how the
scope<00:05:55.130> actually<00:05:55.460> attaches<00:05:55.849> to<00:05:55.880> your<00:05:56.029> rifle

00:05:56.140 --> 00:05:56.150 
scope actually attaches to your rifle

00:05:56.150 --> 00:05:58.149 
scope actually attaches to your rifle
you<00:05:56.930> need<00:05:57.110> like<00:05:57.259> a<00:05:57.289> little<00:05:57.380> bit<00:05:57.620> of<00:05:57.710> spacer

00:05:58.149 --> 00:05:58.159 
you need like a little bit of spacer

00:05:58.159 --> 00:06:01.059 
you need like a little bit of spacer
anyways<00:05:58.759> so<00:05:59.349> have<00:06:00.349> a<00:06:00.380> little<00:06:00.590> bit<00:06:00.710> of<00:06:00.740> spacer

00:06:01.059 --> 00:06:01.069 
anyways so have a little bit of spacer

00:06:01.069 --> 00:06:02.200 
anyways so have a little bit of spacer
and<00:06:01.340> then<00:06:01.460> you<00:06:01.550> could<00:06:01.669> just<00:06:01.819> take<00:06:01.969> that<00:06:02.000> on

00:06:02.200 --> 00:06:02.210 
and then you could just take that on

00:06:02.210 --> 00:06:04.600 
and then you could just take that on
directly<00:06:02.659> or<00:06:02.900> what<00:06:03.529> I<00:06:03.560> did<00:06:03.770> was<00:06:03.949> I<00:06:03.979> used<00:06:04.159> this

00:06:04.600 --> 00:06:04.610 
directly or what I did was I used this

00:06:04.610 --> 00:06:07.089 
directly or what I did was I used this
little<00:06:04.849> piece<00:06:05.810> that<00:06:06.020> slides<00:06:06.380> on<00:06:06.770> to<00:06:06.949> like

00:06:07.089 --> 00:06:07.099 
little piece that slides on to like

00:06:07.099 --> 00:06:09.279 
little piece that slides on to like
another<00:06:07.370> hollow<00:06:07.669> one<00:06:07.909> on<00:06:08.060> the<00:06:08.840> on<00:06:09.020> the<00:06:09.139> actual

00:06:09.279 --> 00:06:09.289 
another hollow one on the on the actual

00:06:09.289 --> 00:06:11.680 
another hollow one on the on the actual
rifle<00:06:09.830> it<00:06:09.919> just<00:06:10.099> slides<00:06:10.400> right<00:06:10.699> onto<00:06:11.090> it<00:06:11.120> if

00:06:11.680 --> 00:06:11.690 
rifle it just slides right onto it if

00:06:11.690 --> 00:06:13.149 
rifle it just slides right onto it if
you<00:06:11.840> want<00:06:11.960> to<00:06:12.050> see<00:06:12.199> how<00:06:12.409> this<00:06:12.590> fits<00:06:12.800> onto<00:06:13.009> the

00:06:13.149 --> 00:06:13.159 
you want to see how this fits onto the

00:06:13.159 --> 00:06:15.309 
you want to see how this fits onto the
rifle<00:06:13.460> go<00:06:13.639> check<00:06:13.849> out<00:06:14.000> the<00:06:14.180> other<00:06:14.360> video<00:06:14.719> the

00:06:15.309 --> 00:06:15.319 
rifle go check out the other video the

00:06:15.319 --> 00:06:17.559 
rifle go check out the other video the
Arctic<00:06:15.650> warfare<00:06:15.889> sniper<00:06:16.370> rifle<00:06:17.090> video<00:06:17.360> and

00:06:17.559 --> 00:06:17.569 
Arctic warfare sniper rifle video and

00:06:17.569 --> 00:06:18.459 
Arctic warfare sniper rifle video and
that'll<00:06:17.779> show<00:06:17.930> you<00:06:17.990> how<00:06:18.139> it's<00:06:18.289> done

00:06:18.459 --> 00:06:18.469 
that'll show you how it's done

00:06:18.469 --> 00:06:22.450 
that'll show you how it's done
so<00:06:19.430> that's<00:06:20.029> basically<00:06:20.509> how<00:06:20.840> you<00:06:21.740> make<00:06:21.949> scopes

00:06:22.450 --> 00:06:22.460 
so that's basically how you make scopes

00:06:22.460 --> 00:06:25.240 
so that's basically how you make scopes
from<00:06:23.029> the<00:06:23.300> really<00:06:23.539> simple<00:06:23.900> ones<00:06:24.070> to<00:06:25.070> the

00:06:25.240 --> 00:06:25.250 
from the really simple ones to the

00:06:25.250 --> 00:06:26.780 
from the really simple ones to the
really<00:06:25.520> big<00:06:25.699> ones<00:06:25.909> and

00:06:26.780 --> 00:06:26.790 
really big ones and

00:06:26.790 --> 00:06:29.240 
really big ones and
to<00:06:27.030> other<00:06:27.180> types<00:06:27.450> of<00:06:27.540> scopes<00:06:27.810> like<00:06:28.110> red<00:06:28.860> dot<00:06:29.070> or

00:06:29.240 --> 00:06:29.250 
to other types of scopes like red dot or

00:06:29.250 --> 00:06:32.270 
to other types of scopes like red dot or
holographic<00:06:29.970> scopes
