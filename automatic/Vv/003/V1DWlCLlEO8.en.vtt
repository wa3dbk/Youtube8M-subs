00:00:00.199 --> 00:00:04.410
 I'll come back with the finishing touches here 

00:00:02.550 --> 00:00:06.060
 in these earrings 

00:00:04.410 --> 00:00:10.370
 I just did it by removing the 

00:00:06.060 --> 00:00:13.259
 here the steel of the year he already had 

00:00:10.370 --> 00:00:16.940
 but while it's over you're left with 

00:00:13.259 --> 00:00:16.940
 their step by step 

00:00:29.900 --> 00:00:34.500
 Let's put on our earrings. 

00:00:32.460 --> 00:00:38.220
 I'm going to take some leftovers here 

00:00:34.500 --> 00:00:40.830
 material I have are blades of 

00:00:38.220 --> 00:00:45.570
 bone that I have stored with the 

00:00:40.830 --> 00:00:49.280
 of marquetry are some of the 

00:00:45.570 --> 00:00:52.739
 so entries that are remnants of 

00:00:49.280 --> 00:00:55.050
 I finally am going to play 

00:00:52.739 --> 00:00:57.809
 here with everything I have of material and 

00:00:55.050 --> 00:00:59.910
 What comes out is left so it's more or less 

00:00:57.809 --> 00:01:02.190
 this is exercise creativity not even 

00:00:59.910 --> 00:01:04.320
 How can I pass the project? 

00:01:02.190 --> 00:01:06.390
 doing here and there you will follow the 

00:01:04.320 --> 00:01:09.149
 process and understand how it is but I go 

00:01:06.390 --> 00:01:11.720
 spend just a concept ok okay 

00:01:09.149 --> 00:01:11.720
 job 

00:01:15.890 --> 00:01:21.590
 i and ii 

00:02:03.009 --> 00:02:06.009
 i 

00:02:32.960 --> 00:02:34.990
 i 

00:02:52.250 --> 00:02:57.959
 good only the hooks give continuity here 

00:02:55.440 --> 00:03:00.780
 the brics I'm going to use a steel wire 

00:02:57.959 --> 00:03:05.129
 it's a north ace and in the end we already 

00:03:00.780 --> 00:03:07.860
 What are you doing? What are you going to do? 

00:03:05.129 --> 00:03:12.330
 after cutting I'll take all I 

00:03:07.860 --> 00:03:17.250
 I'm going to bend a little tip that's to help. 

00:03:12.330 --> 00:03:19.500
 to hold it in the bottom of the hole when 

00:03:17.250 --> 00:03:25.280
 will enter and with the glue it will stay 

00:03:19.500 --> 00:03:32.040
 so now I get a little bit of 

00:03:25.280 --> 00:03:42.930
 It takes off fast but it's a little bit 

00:03:32.040 --> 00:03:48.930
 People and there, she'll let 

00:03:42.930 --> 00:03:53.069
 dry it we go to the finish of the 

00:03:48.930 --> 00:03:54.510
 earrings is I have chosen kufuor will only wear 

00:03:53.069 --> 00:03:57.299
 a wax 

00:03:54.510 --> 00:04:01.739
 there are several scenes in the market but 

00:03:57.299 --> 00:04:05.000
 I'm using a scene on this floor. 

00:04:01.739 --> 00:04:07.500
 for the same wood then it's just look it's 

00:04:05.000 --> 00:04:10.670
 procedure would you take some 

00:04:07.500 --> 00:04:12.690
 being a fan is the truth is a bit of being 

00:04:10.670 --> 00:04:15.660
 apply on the part 

00:04:12.690 --> 00:04:22.970
 here is a small part we do in the 

00:04:15.660 --> 00:04:22.970
 finger is a few 

00:04:23.710 --> 00:04:30.910
 Leave for a few minutes a little 

00:04:28.300 --> 00:04:35.770
 to pull a little and then in with 

00:04:30.910 --> 00:04:39.610
 cotton and gives a shrinkage or 

00:04:35.770 --> 00:04:41.680
 Can you use dre mine with this world? 

00:04:39.610 --> 00:04:44.650
 schin filter that see in it that 

00:04:41.680 --> 00:04:47.639
 helps in this task as well and 

00:04:44.650 --> 00:04:47.639
 gives even greater brightness 

00:04:49.530 --> 00:04:59.080
 what I wanted to look like in a way 

00:04:55.300 --> 00:05:01.300
 clean but not too bright 

00:04:59.080 --> 00:05:05.199
 when she wears a braid she pulls a little 

00:05:01.300 --> 00:05:07.090
 more in brightness to make a hook 

00:05:05.199 --> 00:05:09.910
 of our chios 

00:05:07.090 --> 00:05:13.840
 I will use a ruler in mdf to make a 

00:05:09.910 --> 00:05:18.610
 I pulled out a cable from a 

00:05:13.840 --> 00:05:20.919
 I'm here to make the curve alone. 

00:05:18.610 --> 00:05:22.960
 with this measure may vary from 

00:05:20.919 --> 00:05:24.520
 According to what you want to do, I 

00:05:22.960 --> 00:05:29.860
 I'll leave my rule as a reference. 

00:05:24.520 --> 00:05:32.800
 It's 15mm here and here's more. 

00:05:29.860 --> 00:05:35.470
 17mm 78mm 

00:05:32.800 --> 00:05:38.740
 so give a little more than twenty twenty 

00:05:35.470 --> 00:05:42.840
 23 mm or so 

00:05:38.740 --> 00:05:42.840
 that I will do not only do this here 

00:05:43.650 --> 00:05:52.180
 I fold it, the goose is ready, it 's just one 

00:05:50.050 --> 00:05:55.539
 issue now of cutting off access and 

00:05:52.180 --> 00:05:57.789
 a slight one modeled on it 

00:05:55.539 --> 00:06:02.219
 good staff and if they are ready 

00:05:57.789 --> 00:06:05.259
 now I'll just pack because those are 

00:06:02.219 --> 00:06:06.910
 they are gifts I hope you have 

00:06:05.259 --> 00:06:10.410
 liked 

00:06:06.910 --> 00:06:10.410
 until the next layer
