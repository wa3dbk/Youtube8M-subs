00:00:59.180 --> 00:01:03.030
 Hello and a wonderful good day my name is Matthias Brandmüller 

00:01:03.030 --> 00:01:05.300
 and some may already know me 

00:01:05.300 --> 00:01:07.940
 from my product the youtube secret 

00:01:07.940 --> 00:01:11.880
 I've been working as an internet marketer for two years now and was allowed to 

00:01:11.880 --> 00:01:16.010
 exclusively this is the most eagerly awaited product chef of the prism 

00:01:16.010 --> 00:01:17.900
 by Tobias Klose test 

00:01:17.900 --> 00:01:21.440
 and with this video she would like to share my personal opinion about this 

00:01:21.440 --> 00:01:22.730
 Have product tested 

00:01:22.730 --> 00:01:25.149
 and give a little insight 

00:01:25.149 --> 00:01:28.000
 what she expects the prism with the boss 

00:01:28.000 --> 00:01:30.580
 because the beta-test is not completed yet 

00:01:30.580 --> 00:01:34.410
 which report him today in this video about which modules I have so far 

00:01:34.410 --> 00:01:35.280
 hold 

00:01:35.280 --> 00:01:36.860
 and have tested 

00:01:36.860 --> 00:01:38.390
 op e 

00:01:38.390 --> 00:01:41.850
 So the first module which I have looked at 

00:01:41.850 --> 00:01:44.010
 was the traffic prism itself 

00:01:44.010 --> 00:01:46.899
 This is printed on a meter of prose 

00:01:46.899 --> 00:01:51.249
 if it illustrates in the simplest way where ever 

00:01:51.249 --> 00:01:53.930
 the shops even flow on the internet 

00:01:53.930 --> 00:01:58.090
 and I have to honestly admit percent only by this poster alone 

00:01:58.090 --> 00:01:59.009
 I was already 

00:01:59.009 --> 00:02:00.480
 Aware of possibilities 

00:02:00.480 --> 00:02:04.750
 I did not even know how to generate traffic and 8 did not 

00:02:04.750 --> 00:02:07.750
 So we'll look over Tobias 

00:02:08.279 --> 00:02:11.079
 the percent again processes at the WTO only the beginning 

00:02:11.079 --> 00:02:13.869
 del another module 

00:02:13.869 --> 00:02:16.030
 maybe not even the main motto 

00:02:16.030 --> 00:02:17.729
 is the traffic Glarner 

00:02:17.729 --> 00:02:22.929
 This is like a guide through the sometimes complex traffic schools 

00:02:22.929 --> 00:02:27.079
 and with the traffic, headline goal Tobias Knoof with an impressive 

00:02:27.079 --> 00:02:29.590
 Method through this tunnel 

00:02:29.590 --> 00:02:32.989
 and adds them to absolutely focused Jeff Beck 

00:02:32.989 --> 00:02:36.939
 where it ends up for a successful internal that that arrives 

00:02:37.629 --> 00:02:40.730
 All the steps were a shining and easy to understand for me 

00:02:40.730 --> 00:02:45.239
 and in my opinion it's illegal if she's a professional sense or he's relative 

00:02:45.239 --> 00:02:48.069
 new in internet marketing 

00:02:48.069 --> 00:02:51.569
 because to every traffic all Wieseck Loth always calls so beautiful 

00:02:51.569 --> 00:02:54.879
 there is an easy to understand explanation 

00:02:54.879 --> 00:02:59.819
 one out of modules, there are seven shirt off among other things to the mysterious 

00:02:59.819 --> 00:03:03.909
 Google ranking as they can their already existing traffic me since then 

00:03:03.909 --> 00:03:05.720
 or a handout 

00:03:05.720 --> 00:03:08.459
 with the name Chadwick multipliers 

00:03:08.459 --> 00:03:11.920
 I would not like to reveal the other four Mr. Tauss at this point 

00:03:11.920 --> 00:03:13.440
 but I can tell you 

00:03:13.440 --> 00:03:15.139
 look forward to it 

00:03:15.139 --> 00:03:19.219
 To summarize the first part of my beta-test, the following remains 

00:03:19.219 --> 00:03:20.179
 accept 

00:03:20.179 --> 00:03:23.789
 what I have seen so far has not only surprised me but also 

00:03:23.789 --> 00:03:24.809
 convinced 

00:03:24.809 --> 00:03:27.569
 What I really liked is the simple and understandable 

00:03:27.569 --> 00:03:31.680
 with the Tobias Knoof, who knows who will bring 

00:03:32.219 --> 00:03:35.419
 and another point I noticed are the many 

00:03:35.419 --> 00:03:39.769
 helpful links to all the necessary websites blogs program 

00:03:39.769 --> 00:03:41.559
 and everything that goes with it 

00:03:41.559 --> 00:03:44.430
 this saves a lot of time and sealed year 

00:03:44.430 --> 00:03:45.739
 time is money 

00:03:45.739 --> 00:03:49.419
 Tobias Klose does not promise much with the product the Traffic Prisma 

00:03:49.419 --> 00:03:51.670
 and he did not deliver one more 

00:03:51.670 --> 00:03:53.039
 as I expected 

00:03:53.039 --> 00:03:55.609
 and believe me the expectations for this product 

00:03:55.609 --> 00:03:58.979
 Traffic prism was with me is very high 

00:03:58.979 --> 00:04:01.659
 my conclusion to the first part of the beta-test 

00:04:01.659 --> 00:04:02.689
 is following 

00:04:02.689 --> 00:04:06.239
 SZ like Prisma is a product of an absolute professional 

00:04:06.239 --> 00:04:10.859
 for Krupp is and so 100 percent on for those who will once 

00:04:10.859 --> 00:04:14.169
 want in my opinion an absolute must for everyone 

00:04:14.169 --> 00:04:17.159
 who wants to make money on the internet 

00:04:17.159 --> 00:04:20.870
 This was the first part of the beta testing and product distribution that was 

00:04:20.870 --> 00:04:22.719
 I hope he liked you 

00:04:22.719 --> 00:04:26.519
 Herzl is Matthias Brandmüller
