00:00:09.970 --> 00:00:13.840
 being the first structure that I 

00:00:12.340 --> 00:00:18.150
 I invented 

00:00:13.840 --> 00:00:18.150
 because with time everything changed 

00:00:21.420 --> 00:00:25.740
 in my name of alá beltrán herrera 

00:00:22.910 --> 00:00:27.600
 I'm dedicated to sculpture and work 

00:00:25.740 --> 00:00:30.140
 on the paper 

00:00:27.600 --> 00:00:32.309
 I decided to focus on industrial design 

00:00:30.140 --> 00:00:34.739
 but I think really what I wanted 

00:00:32.309 --> 00:00:36.540
 was to be an artist but when I graduated 

00:00:34.739 --> 00:00:38.610
 I realized that I did not want to do the 

00:00:36.540 --> 00:00:40.500
 design career since I started there 

00:00:38.610 --> 00:00:43.050
 paint and I realized that I liked 

00:00:40.500 --> 00:00:44.550
 I made many drawings always explore 

00:00:43.050 --> 00:00:47.239
 many things 

00:00:44.550 --> 00:00:47.239
 known 

00:00:47.810 --> 00:00:55.990
 and he invited me to do an exhibition in 

00:00:53.180 --> 00:00:55.990
 cooperation with him 

00:01:00.880 --> 00:01:03.450
 of cultures 

00:01:14.030 --> 00:01:18.290
 university solved everything by 

00:01:16.280 --> 00:01:19.909
 paper because the paper was very cheap and 

00:01:18.290 --> 00:01:21.590
 If I wanted to do something I did not have to 

00:01:19.909 --> 00:01:23.390
 complicate me I could always put together 

00:01:21.590 --> 00:01:25.220
 a political opportunity 

00:01:23.390 --> 00:01:27.080
 it was more like a laboratory to discover 

00:01:25.220 --> 00:01:28.460
 what potential did the material have then 

00:01:27.080 --> 00:01:29.840
 let's say the design career if I 

00:01:28.460 --> 00:01:31.580
 it serves to understand that I believe 

00:01:29.840 --> 00:01:33.050
 need need of an object and 

00:01:31.580 --> 00:01:35.540
 I wanted all the time they're looking for that 

00:01:33.050 --> 00:01:38.720
 true somewhere I made some 

00:01:35.540 --> 00:01:40.460
 trials of representing animals because 

00:01:38.720 --> 00:01:42.229
 in that we are making animals and 

00:01:40.460 --> 00:01:43.790
 we are doing landscapes of some 

00:01:42.229 --> 00:01:46.280
 reason he was very struck by the 

00:01:43.790 --> 00:01:49.369
 parents who were there because it was something 

00:01:46.280 --> 00:01:51.440
 new that I had seen that I do not say 

00:01:49.369 --> 00:01:52.909
 having a rat in Colombia here 

00:01:51.440 --> 00:01:54.950
 we lavish that the city say since 

00:01:52.909 --> 00:01:56.270
 those who are underwhelmed because we are more 

00:01:54.950 --> 00:01:58.429
 pending other that is that those would be 

00:01:56.270 --> 00:02:00.140
 that of the same nature instead 

00:01:58.429 --> 00:02:02.509
 the city was so quiet that I could not 

00:02:00.140 --> 00:02:04.159
 allocate that time to feel everything 

00:02:02.509 --> 00:02:05.840
 that exists around 

00:02:04.159 --> 00:02:08.599
 then that's where the work was born and 

00:02:05.840 --> 00:02:10.729
 began to represent what I have 

00:02:08.599 --> 00:02:12.080
 I really liked what connected me with the 

00:02:10.729 --> 00:02:13.879
 My intention is not to do things that 

00:02:12.080 --> 00:02:15.590
 I was restless but start 

00:02:13.879 --> 00:02:17.000
 represent that this being so alive 

00:02:15.590 --> 00:02:19.160
 and that you can only see through the 

00:02:17.000 --> 00:02:21.349
 movement and I connect a lot because it was 

00:02:19.160 --> 00:02:23.410
 very colorful and by the shapes that 

00:02:21.349 --> 00:02:26.629
 they had and then when I arrived in Bogota 

00:02:23.410 --> 00:02:28.220
 I started to notice chivu also 

00:02:26.629 --> 00:02:30.319
 there are those things then I started to 

00:02:28.220 --> 00:02:32.760
 identify that there were many things that 

00:02:30.319 --> 00:02:35.730
 I had never seen the kind of life 

00:02:32.760 --> 00:02:39.510
 the work always starts looking for a 

00:02:35.730 --> 00:02:42.060
 image then as the poetry of 

00:02:39.510 --> 00:02:43.890
 movement how is expressed as the 

00:02:42.060 --> 00:02:45.750
 utility that you have is the body but 

00:02:43.890 --> 00:02:48.180
 this is a personal meditation that I 

00:02:45.750 --> 00:02:50.730
 have to understand that what exists 

00:02:48.180 --> 00:02:53.489
 it's not inventing something but returning it to 

00:02:50.730 --> 00:02:55.469
 do and realize that people are 

00:02:53.489 --> 00:02:57.450
 he cares more what one does than what 

00:02:55.469 --> 00:02:59.129
 that exists but through that that 

00:02:57.450 --> 00:03:01.650
 they are watching they begin to recognize that 

00:02:59.129 --> 00:03:04.620
 that exists outside then if you have a 

00:03:01.650 --> 00:03:06.930
 educational sense for me to go out to the 

00:03:04.620 --> 00:03:08.849
 street and say I'm 26 but still 

00:03:06.930 --> 00:03:12.230
 see how to handle as a child a hundred 

00:03:08.849 --> 00:03:12.230
 with everything that exists outside 

00:03:15.610 --> 00:03:19.630
 I get up in a first that I do is 

00:03:17.650 --> 00:03:21.720
 think I can get new 

00:03:19.630 --> 00:03:23.670
 opportunities for work 

00:03:21.720 --> 00:03:25.620
 that's something very modern that happens now 

00:03:23.670 --> 00:03:27.570
 by not having a gallery and not having a 

00:03:25.620 --> 00:03:29.090
 new place where to show that one does 

00:03:27.570 --> 00:03:32.970
 that does not cling to the internet 

00:03:29.090 --> 00:03:35.460
 so I started with a flicker and 

00:03:32.970 --> 00:03:36.690
 I have the facebook then I am all 

00:03:35.460 --> 00:03:38.100
 the time feeding the blog in the 

00:03:36.690 --> 00:03:40.680
 facebook uploading things that I'm 

00:03:38.100 --> 00:03:42.270
 doing they started as shown that I 

00:03:40.680 --> 00:03:44.970
 They made in rhythms namely those blogs 

00:03:42.270 --> 00:03:48.000
 they have a lot of acceptance and people 

00:03:44.970 --> 00:03:50.490
 visit a lot and thanks to that I started to 

00:03:48.000 --> 00:03:51.900
 receive then as job offers 

00:03:50.490 --> 00:03:54.510
 you want to do this because it supposes a 

00:03:51.900 --> 00:03:56.100
 exhibition and everything developed by 

00:03:54.510 --> 00:03:58.470
 internet because it is the only way 

00:03:56.100 --> 00:04:01.230
 of one leaving without having to be there to 

00:03:58.470 --> 00:04:03.330
 they see me more as a paper artist and 

00:04:01.230 --> 00:04:04.950
 let's say that there is a group because 

00:04:03.330 --> 00:04:06.720
 artists of papers in some 

00:04:04.950 --> 00:04:09.090
 compilations of paper artists in 

00:04:06.720 --> 00:04:11.310
 books then that way I feel that 

00:04:09.090 --> 00:04:14.360
 I have gotten on that side that is not something 

00:04:11.310 --> 00:04:16.549
 that exists here in Colombia still 

00:04:14.360 --> 00:04:17.950
 that is, he is more interested than me 

00:04:16.549 --> 00:04:20.200
 they are contacting 

00:04:17.950 --> 00:04:23.130
 then a fight is a fight all the 

00:04:20.200 --> 00:04:25.420
 day one the manager who does not know how to do 

00:04:23.130 --> 00:04:27.910
 producing and thinking what I'm going to do 

00:04:25.420 --> 00:04:31.410
 tomorrow to get this idea to 

00:04:27.910 --> 00:04:31.410
 die but will continue to feed
