 we have a gesture and everything and everything in 

00:00:01.709 --> 00:00:05.069
 this video is actually a small 

00:00:03.149 --> 00:00:08.069
 video developed in relation to the 

00:00:05.069 --> 00:00:08.880
 video and the 27 that I had put so I 

00:00:08.069 --> 00:00:10.830
 know that there are people already that they are going 

00:00:08.880 --> 00:00:12.509
 ask me questions about 

00:00:10.830 --> 00:00:14.009
 that 's always the same 

00:00:12.509 --> 00:00:16.500
 expressions it's just that I put some 

00:00:14.009 --> 00:00:19.350
 red because I was tired with the 

00:00:16.500 --> 00:00:21.449
 Morocco so what I wanted to say in 

00:00:19.350 --> 00:00:23.609
 actually is that the video actually that I have 

00:00:21.449 --> 00:00:25.769
 put adventurer who actually talks about the 

00:00:23.609 --> 00:00:26.760
 recipe of prawns with couscous in 

00:00:25.769 --> 00:00:27.689
 what happens is that usually 

00:00:26.760 --> 00:00:29.580
 when I have not in this movie and I 

00:00:27.689 --> 00:00:31.470
 make sure I have videos in stock that 

00:00:29.580 --> 00:00:34.440
 I put in case we can not film 

00:00:31.470 --> 00:00:37.649
 so what I put online yesterday 

00:00:34.440 --> 00:00:39.059
 that was it I did not eat by a dish of 

00:00:37.649 --> 00:00:41.190
 couscous and shrimp but he 

00:00:39.059 --> 00:00:43.920
 does not prevent the prawns the plan of 

00:00:41.190 --> 00:00:45.600
 mass of about 250 calories for 

00:00:43.920 --> 00:00:46.649
 gambas society so that's it 

00:00:45.600 --> 00:00:49.079
 also simple things you can 

00:00:46.649 --> 00:00:50.760
 eat now I'm actually talking to you 

00:00:49.079 --> 00:00:52.260
 things that I started doing there 

00:00:50.760 --> 00:00:54.840

00:00:52.260 --> 00:00:56.039

 so he said that enough is too much 

00:00:58.260 --> 00:01:03.449
 and so what I started doing 

00:01:00.300 --> 00:01:05.159
 it's first in the morning every people 

00:01:03.449 --> 00:01:06.570

00:01:30.210 --> 00:01:32.850
 more energy 

00:01:31.140 --> 00:01:34.680
 I do not know if it's psychological but 

00:01:32.850 --> 00:01:35.820
 I do not think it's psychological I 

00:01:34.680 --> 00:01:39.360
 see a little difference 

00:01:35.820 --> 00:01:41.070
 already and then no I take miss movie and 

00:01:39.360 --> 00:01:42.390
 I take soup in the evening 

00:01:41.070 --> 00:01:44.490
 I try to eat light did not pass 

00:01:42.390 --> 00:01:47.250
 I try I eat light in the evening I 

00:01:44.490 --> 00:01:49.439
 take some soup and here is the morning the 

00:01:47.250 --> 00:01:51.509
 most of the time I showed I watch 

00:01:49.439 --> 00:01:54.630
 also the recipes I make pancakes 

00:01:51.509 --> 00:01:56.450

 weight loss so here and then 

00:02:03.210 --> 00:02:06.299
 what else is that I 

00:02:04.229 --> 00:02:08.550
 do this belgian drinks a lot of water and 

00:02:06.299 --> 00:02:10.759
 also in the morning when I wake up I 

00:02:08.550 --> 00:02:12.760
 take lemon and then I mix 

00:02:10.759 --> 00:02:14.989
 with doubl'Ã´ we'll say I'll take 

00:02:12.760 --> 00:02:17.180
 I take 20 centiliters points 

00:02:14.989 --> 00:02:19.340
 of lemon and then I will deal with a 

00:02:17.180 --> 00:02:21.079
 half a cup of water I take it in the morning 

00:02:19.340 --> 00:02:23.450
 when I dreamed and I take it in the evening 

00:02:21.079 --> 00:02:24.709
 before going to sleep and something else 

00:02:23.450 --> 00:02:31.970
 also no I wanted to talk to you this is 

00:02:24.709 --> 00:02:34.730
 that I take the often that I take 

00:02:31.970 --> 00:02:37.480
 these coffee bing greens anyone 

00:02:34.730 --> 00:02:40.280
 not know the brink of being white has 

00:02:37.480 --> 00:02:41.989
 green coffee seed extract and this in 

00:02:40.280 --> 00:02:43.519
 does it's dietary supplements 

00:02:41.989 --> 00:02:46.099
 is it going to do is it's okay 

00:02:43.519 --> 00:02:48.950
 not at all you take off do not know of 

00:02:46.099 --> 00:02:51.260
 everything you take off want to eat it's going 

00:02:48.950 --> 00:02:53.900
 to cut your appetite will not 

00:02:51.260 --> 00:02:54.769
 to give a feeling of satiety everything 

00:02:53.900 --> 00:02:57.230
 what's going to do is it's okay 

00:02:54.769 --> 00:02:58.519
 work with your metabolism as 

00:02:57.230 --> 00:03:00.319
 that when you play sport 

00:02:58.519 --> 00:03:01.370
 you sweat twice as dense and 

00:03:00.319 --> 00:03:02.750
 it helps to sweat 

00:03:01.370 --> 00:03:04.250
 so it's not something that will 

00:03:02.750 --> 00:03:06.739
 you cut wildlife what me I think 

00:03:04.250 --> 00:03:09.590
 not only for me actually and then the oil 

00:03:06.739 --> 00:03:10.750
 who say yes she was doing boxes 

00:03:09.590 --> 00:03:12.859
 and cut 

00:03:10.750 --> 00:03:14.209
 how to say the feeling of hunger while 

00:03:12.859 --> 00:03:15.980
 that I do not take because at the 

00:03:14.209 --> 00:03:18.560
 base you want to try us even 

00:03:15.980 --> 00:03:20.870
 control how we eat 

00:03:18.560 --> 00:03:23.329
 control our borrowing facility 

00:03:20.870 --> 00:03:25.160
 pills that just couple the 

00:03:23.329 --> 00:03:26.510
 feeling of ease or that decreases the 

00:03:25.160 --> 00:03:28.579
 end I find that after when we 

00:03:26.510 --> 00:03:29.540
 stop doing what is better 

00:03:28.579 --> 00:03:31.040
 to go with things that are 

00:03:29.540 --> 00:03:32.720
 natural ones who are for his natural 

00:03:31.040 --> 00:03:34.220
 so the green coffee seeds and that's 

00:03:32.720 --> 00:03:35.989
 really really good because 

00:03:34.220 --> 00:03:38.209
 when I do the sport really I 

00:03:35.989 --> 00:03:39.919
 sweats of faith can both 

00:03:38.209 --> 00:03:41.569
 since I started the four 

00:03:39.919 --> 00:03:43.519
 days there I made hope this mode of 

00:03:41.569 --> 00:03:45.109
 time I want to get to do the sport at 

00:03:43.519 --> 00:03:48.169
 at least four to five times a week 

00:03:45.109 --> 00:03:50.299
 and finally it was just for the 

00:03:48.169 --> 00:03:51.500
 point and then I will make points a 

00:03:50.299 --> 00:03:52.790
 times a week like that but I 

00:03:51.500 --> 00:03:54.949
 could not do as I did this 

00:03:52.790 --> 00:03:56.389
 been making videos every day 

00:03:54.949 --> 00:03:57.530
 because I will be able to arrive 

00:03:56.389 --> 00:03:59.659
 I really do not have time 

00:03:57.530 --> 00:04:02.569
 but here in that it was just for the 

00:03:59.659 --> 00:04:04.220
 point and then on another point the week 

00:04:02.569 --> 00:04:07.099
 next and then I wanted to also say 

00:04:04.220 --> 00:04:07.669
 that when I will be passing through paris in 

00:04:07.099 --> 00:04:10.760
