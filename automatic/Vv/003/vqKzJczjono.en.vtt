turned<00:02:02.909> heel<00:02:03.180> he<00:02:03.390> didn't<00:02:03.689> win<00:02:03.840> the<00:02:03.960> title<00:02:04.259> in

00:02:04.429 --> 00:02:04.439 
turned heel he didn't win the title in

00:02:04.439 --> 00:02:07.219 
turned heel he didn't win the title in
his<00:02:04.530> first<00:02:04.590> attempt<00:02:05.280> as<00:02:05.460> a<00:02:05.520> heel<00:02:06.180> I<00:02:06.420> think<00:02:07.140> it's

00:02:07.219 --> 00:02:07.229 
his first attempt as a heel I think it's

00:02:07.229 --> 00:02:09.979 
his first attempt as a heel I think it's
going<00:02:07.320> to<00:02:07.409> be<00:02:07.469> the<00:02:07.619> same<00:02:07.860> here<00:02:08.280> were<00:02:08.879> you<00:02:09.869> know

00:02:09.979 --> 00:02:09.989 
going to be the same here were you know

00:02:09.989 --> 00:02:12.230 
going to be the same here were you know
yeah<00:02:10.319> page<00:02:10.679> now<00:02:11.069> this<00:02:11.700> is<00:02:11.879> going<00:02:12.000> to<00:02:12.060> be

00:02:12.230 --> 00:02:12.240 
yeah page now this is going to be

00:02:12.240 --> 00:02:15.350 
yeah page now this is going to be
aj<00:02:13.200> versus<00:02:13.920> page<00:02:14.130> and<00:02:14.520> it's<00:02:14.700> the<00:02:14.790> first<00:02:14.820> time

00:02:15.350 --> 00:02:15.360 
aj versus page and it's the first time

00:02:15.360 --> 00:02:18.320 
aj versus page and it's the first time
that<00:02:15.420> page<00:02:16.140> is<00:02:16.640> wrestling<00:02:17.640> as<00:02:17.760> a<00:02:17.790> heel<00:02:18.060> against

00:02:18.320 --> 00:02:18.330 
that page is wrestling as a heel against

00:02:18.330 --> 00:02:22.690 
that page is wrestling as a heel against
AJ<00:02:18.750> and<00:02:19.670> I<00:02:20.670> think<00:02:21.270> that<00:02:21.480> even<00:02:21.900> though<00:02:22.020> this<00:02:22.230> is

00:02:22.690 --> 00:02:22.700 
AJ and I think that even though this is

00:02:22.700 --> 00:02:25.730 
AJ and I think that even though this is
Paige's<00:02:23.700> second<00:02:24.150> attempt<00:02:24.600> at<00:02:24.840> a<00:02:24.900> rematch<00:02:25.410> I

00:02:25.730 --> 00:02:25.740 
Paige's second attempt at a rematch I

00:02:25.740 --> 00:02:27.110 
Paige's second attempt at a rematch I
think<00:02:26.100> she's<00:02:26.250> gonna<00:02:26.370> lose<00:02:26.580> this<00:02:26.700> one<00:02:26.880> too<00:02:26.940> just

00:02:27.110 --> 00:02:27.120 
think she's gonna lose this one too just

00:02:27.120 --> 00:02:29.810 
think she's gonna lose this one too just
like<00:02:27.510> Christian<00:02:28.110> lost<00:02:28.800> his<00:02:29.010> second<00:02:29.400> attempt

00:02:29.810 --> 00:02:29.820 
like Christian lost his second attempt

00:02:29.820 --> 00:02:32.570 
like Christian lost his second attempt
at<00:02:29.940> a<00:02:30.000> rematch<00:02:30.420> as<00:02:30.660> well<00:02:30.960> at<00:02:31.260> i<00:02:31.920> believe<00:02:32.250> it<00:02:32.400> was

00:02:32.570 --> 00:02:32.580 
at a rematch as well at i believe it was

00:02:32.580 --> 00:02:35.960 
at a rematch as well at i believe it was
capital<00:02:33.270> punishments<00:02:34.190> was<00:02:35.190> it<00:02:35.400> I<00:02:35.550> think<00:02:35.910> it

00:02:35.960 --> 00:02:35.970 
capital punishments was it I think it

00:02:35.970 --> 00:02:38.720 
capital punishments was it I think it
was<00:02:36.120> yeah<00:02:36.480> it<00:02:36.510> was<00:02:36.720> fun<00:02:37.410> just<00:02:37.680> like<00:02:38.130> Christian

00:02:38.720 --> 00:02:38.730 
was yeah it was fun just like Christian

00:02:38.730 --> 00:02:41.150 
was yeah it was fun just like Christian
I<00:02:38.880> think<00:02:39.330> Paige<00:02:39.660> is<00:02:40.050> gonna<00:02:40.350> be<00:02:40.500> successful

00:02:41.150 --> 00:02:41.160 
I think Paige is gonna be successful

00:02:41.160 --> 00:02:43.310 
I think Paige is gonna be successful
though<00:02:41.340> and<00:02:41.660> eventually<00:02:42.660> capturing<00:02:43.230> the

00:02:43.310 --> 00:02:43.320 
though and eventually capturing the

00:02:43.320 --> 00:02:46.880 
though and eventually capturing the
Divas<00:02:43.590> Championship<00:02:44.070> from<00:02:44.850> AJ<00:02:45.570> in<00:02:46.110> her<00:02:46.440> third

00:02:46.880 --> 00:02:46.890 
Divas Championship from AJ in her third

00:02:46.890 --> 00:02:48.050 
Divas Championship from AJ in her third
attempt<00:02:47.280> that's<00:02:47.460> right<00:02:47.640> i<00:02:47.670> think<00:02:47.790> there's

00:02:48.050 --> 00:02:48.060 
attempt that's right i think there's

00:02:48.060 --> 00:02:49.850 
attempt that's right i think there's
gonna<00:02:48.180> be<00:02:48.450> a<00:02:48.480> rematch<00:02:48.990> at<00:02:49.350> night<00:02:49.710> of<00:02:49.830> champions

00:02:49.850 --> 00:02:49.860 
gonna be a rematch at night of champions

00:02:49.860 --> 00:02:54.350 
gonna be a rematch at night of champions
between<00:02:50.580> Paige<00:02:51.030> and<00:02:51.270> AJ<00:02:51.890> despite<00:02:52.890> you<00:02:53.250> know<00:02:53.400> me

00:02:54.350 --> 00:02:54.360 
between Paige and AJ despite you know me

00:02:54.360 --> 00:02:56.060 
between Paige and AJ despite you know me
thinking<00:02:54.750> that<00:02:54.780> page<00:02:55.230> is<00:02:55.470> gonna<00:02:55.740> lose<00:02:55.890> her

00:02:56.060 --> 00:02:56.070 
thinking that page is gonna lose her

00:02:56.070 --> 00:02:58.160 
thinking that page is gonna lose her
second<00:02:56.610> rematch<00:02:56.910> I<00:02:57.090> still<00:02:57.420> think<00:02:57.450> she's<00:02:57.870> gonna

00:02:58.160 --> 00:02:58.170 
second rematch I still think she's gonna

00:02:58.170 --> 00:03:00.740 
second rematch I still think she's gonna
um<00:02:58.560> you<00:02:59.400> know<00:02:59.520> get<00:02:59.850> another<00:03:00.180> title<00:03:00.540> shot

00:03:00.740 --> 00:03:00.750 
um you know get another title shot

00:03:00.750 --> 00:03:03.410 
um you know get another title shot
somehow<00:03:01.290> maybe<00:03:01.590> by<00:03:02.060> winning<00:03:03.060> a<00:03:03.120> number<00:03:03.330> one

00:03:03.410 --> 00:03:03.420 
somehow maybe by winning a number one

00:03:03.420 --> 00:03:06.380 
somehow maybe by winning a number one
contender's<00:03:03.450> match<00:03:03.900> or<00:03:04.430> by<00:03:05.430> the<00:03:05.490> results<00:03:06.300> of

00:03:06.380 --> 00:03:06.390 
contender's match or by the results of

00:03:06.390 --> 00:03:09.610 
contender's match or by the results of
this<00:03:06.690> match<00:03:07.050> and<00:03:07.380> by<00:03:08.010> that<00:03:08.250> what<00:03:08.580> I<00:03:08.640> mean<00:03:08.730> is

00:03:09.610 --> 00:03:09.620 
this match and by that what I mean is

00:03:09.620 --> 00:03:12.500 
this match and by that what I mean is
the<00:03:10.620> way<00:03:10.800> I<00:03:10.830> see<00:03:11.160> AJ<00:03:11.520> winning<00:03:11.790> this<00:03:11.880> match<00:03:12.180> is

00:03:12.500 --> 00:03:12.510 
the way I see AJ winning this match is

00:03:12.510 --> 00:03:17.600 
the way I see AJ winning this match is
in<00:03:13.110> a<00:03:13.350> way<00:03:13.590> that<00:03:14.000> gives<00:03:15.470> page<00:03:16.470> a<00:03:16.860> reason<00:03:17.400> to

00:03:17.600 --> 00:03:17.610 
in a way that gives page a reason to

00:03:17.610 --> 00:03:19.640 
in a way that gives page a reason to
request<00:03:18.060> a<00:03:18.240> rematch<00:03:18.660> just<00:03:19.350> like<00:03:19.500> when

00:03:19.640 --> 00:03:19.650 
request a rematch just like when

00:03:19.650 --> 00:03:21.890 
request a rematch just like when
Christian<00:03:20.100> lost<00:03:20.400> his<00:03:20.730> rematch<00:03:21.060> against<00:03:21.450> Randy

00:03:21.890 --> 00:03:21.900 
Christian lost his rematch against Randy

00:03:21.900 --> 00:03:24.410 
Christian lost his rematch against Randy
at<00:03:21.990> capital<00:03:22.380> punishments<00:03:23.070> in<00:03:23.580> that<00:03:24.180> match

00:03:24.410 --> 00:03:24.420 
at capital punishments in that match

00:03:24.420 --> 00:03:26.630 
at capital punishments in that match
when<00:03:24.810> ready<00:03:25.020> hit<00:03:25.200> the<00:03:25.320> RKO<00:03:25.650> and<00:03:25.740> cover<00:03:26.130> Randy

00:03:26.630 --> 00:03:26.640 
when ready hit the RKO and cover Randy

00:03:26.640 --> 00:03:28.700 
when ready hit the RKO and cover Randy
Christian<00:03:27.420> had<00:03:27.570> his<00:03:27.750> foot<00:03:27.960> under<00:03:28.380> the<00:03:28.410> rope

00:03:28.700 --> 00:03:28.710 
Christian had his foot under the rope

00:03:28.710 --> 00:03:31.160 
Christian had his foot under the rope
and<00:03:29.010> the<00:03:29.670> referee<00:03:29.940> didn't<00:03:30.180> see<00:03:30.210> that<00:03:30.390> so<00:03:30.900> he

00:03:31.160 --> 00:03:31.170 
and the referee didn't see that so he

00:03:31.170 --> 00:03:33.400 
and the referee didn't see that so he
just<00:03:31.440> you<00:03:31.680> know<00:03:31.710> gave<00:03:32.100> the<00:03:32.220> winter<00:03:32.580> Randy<00:03:33.030> and

00:03:33.400 --> 00:03:33.410 
just you know gave the winter Randy and

00:03:33.410 --> 00:03:35.930 
just you know gave the winter Randy and
because<00:03:34.410> of<00:03:34.440> that<00:03:34.620> foot<00:03:35.040> under<00:03:35.280> the<00:03:35.310> rope<00:03:35.610> it

00:03:35.930 --> 00:03:35.940 
because of that foot under the rope it

00:03:35.940 --> 00:03:38.000 
because of that foot under the rope it
gave<00:03:36.240> Christian<00:03:36.690> a<00:03:36.810> third<00:03:37.050> title<00:03:37.380> match<00:03:37.650> and

00:03:38.000 --> 00:03:38.010 
gave Christian a third title match and

00:03:38.010 --> 00:03:41.060 
gave Christian a third title match and
so<00:03:38.970> I<00:03:39.240> think<00:03:39.600> something<00:03:40.260> just<00:03:40.290> like<00:03:40.590> that<00:03:40.650> is

00:03:41.060 --> 00:03:41.070 
so I think something just like that is

00:03:41.070 --> 00:03:43.730 
so I think something just like that is
gonna<00:03:41.310> happen<00:03:41.550> here<00:03:42.060> where<00:03:42.750> I<00:03:43.140> could<00:03:43.530> see

00:03:43.730 --> 00:03:43.740 
gonna happen here where I could see

00:03:43.740 --> 00:03:46.280 
gonna happen here where I could see
maybe<00:03:43.980> AJ<00:03:44.640> locks<00:03:44.910> in<00:03:45.150> the<00:03:45.240> Black<00:03:45.450> Widow<00:03:45.480> and

00:03:46.280 --> 00:03:46.290 
maybe AJ locks in the Black Widow and

00:03:46.290 --> 00:03:49.370 
maybe AJ locks in the Black Widow and
maybe<00:03:47.040> Paige<00:03:47.580> grabs<00:03:48.030> the<00:03:48.240> ropes<00:03:48.510> but<00:03:49.110> the

00:03:49.370 --> 00:03:49.380 
maybe Paige grabs the ropes but the

00:03:49.380 --> 00:03:51.440 
maybe Paige grabs the ropes but the
referee<00:03:49.530> doesn't<00:03:49.800> see<00:03:50.160> it<00:03:50.310> or<00:03:50.610> AJ<00:03:51.090> hits<00:03:51.330> the

00:03:51.440 --> 00:03:51.450 
referee doesn't see it or AJ hits the

00:03:51.450 --> 00:03:54.950 
referee doesn't see it or AJ hits the
shining<00:03:51.810> wizard<00:03:52.080> and<00:03:52.740> this<00:03:53.250> time<00:03:53.580> pages<00:03:54.360> leg

00:03:54.950 --> 00:03:54.960 
shining wizard and this time pages leg

00:03:54.960 --> 00:03:57.680 
shining wizard and this time pages leg
is<00:03:55.170> under<00:03:55.410> the<00:03:55.560> rope<00:03:55.820> basically<00:03:56.820> something

00:03:57.680 --> 00:03:57.690 
is under the rope basically something

00:03:57.690 --> 00:04:00.560 
is under the rope basically something
that<00:03:57.960> the<00:03:58.290> referee<00:03:58.620> doesn't<00:03:58.890> see<00:03:59.340> or<00:03:59.580> you<00:04:00.480> know

00:04:00.560 --> 00:04:00.570 
that the referee doesn't see or you know

00:04:00.570 --> 00:04:03.110 
that the referee doesn't see or you know
a<00:04:00.720> mistake<00:04:01.290> by<00:04:01.620> there<00:04:01.830> for<00:04:02.070> you<00:04:02.190> that<00:04:02.370> allows
