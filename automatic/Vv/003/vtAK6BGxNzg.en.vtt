 sf covered. Instead, the interim has a huge wavelength 

00:00:04.440 --> 00:00:09.990
 I recall the incident caused 

00:00:06.299 --> 00:00:15.870
 What happened? Well, it was a music program. 

00:00:09.990 --> 00:00:17.460
 Set the example, music rehearsal already more than two hours during the 3 minutes of play pd 

00:00:15.870 --> 00:00:20.670
 Let's cut down on 30 seconds. 

00:00:17.460 --> 00:00:23.670

00:00:20.670 --> 00:00:28.949
 It's a great song. 

00:00:23.670 --> 00:00:32.940

 Not because he knew that everything that you left hers doeguyo So I get angry 

00:00:37.290 --> 00:00:43.140
 I would appreciate it if you set it to 3 minutes and 30 seconds in advance. 

00:00:41.760 --> 00:00:47.010
 If you did 

00:00:43.140 --> 00:00:51.660
 I would have been willing to change the arrangement may incorrectly are required equipment available 

00:00:47.010 --> 00:00:57.030
 Even when I was caught, I was told by Medi Job, 

00:00:51.660 --> 00:01:04.430
 Oh, that's really not doegetgo Po if the job suddenly deulyeowaseo yet persuaded to write

 I can just give a singer s a special broadcast. 

00:01:42.479 --> 00:01:49.770
 Until then, there were a lot of sanctions . 

00:01:46.350 --> 00:01:54.780
 Common to all 

00:01:49.770 --> 00:01:56.160
 But why is mbc a special program for a certain number of special programs 

00:01:54.780 --> 00:01:59.130

 I have a subtitle on the air so much that I have a warrant here 

00:02:24.180 --> 00:02:32.980
 All the regulations will be inflated by the appearance of the character . 

00:02:29.260 --> 00:02:37.689
 Well, is not that a great contributor to that freedom ? 

00:02:32.980 --> 00:02:39.040
 It is fair to say that it is the behavior you want in principle. 

00:02:37.689 --> 00:02:43.629
 Facts 

00:02:39.040 --> 00:02:45.549
 If so, you should have given other singers a fair chance. 

00:02:43.629 --> 00:02:50.110
 I'm telling you. 

00:02:45.549 --> 00:02:51.489
 Do not take time for a person with such an influence . 

00:02:50.110 --> 00:02:55.810
 It's not. 

00:02:51.489 --> 00:03:00.579
 He has the qualities of a big star and he's got a big star. 

00:02:55.810 --> 00:03:05.440
 It is very welcomed that the music market is becoming more diversified and changeable. 

00:03:00.579 --> 00:03:09.159
 It's a good thing to do, but it's the atmosphere 

00:03:05.440 --> 00:03:14.739
 In order to compete with each other, 

00:03:09.159 --> 00:03:15.849
 Also on its growth and to create a process that fact to the airport 

00:03:14.739 --> 00:03:21.340
 Role 

00:03:15.849 --> 00:03:26.170

00:03:21.340 --> 00:03:30.370

 This is the part of it that was bold over it. 

00:03:47.570 --> 00:03:51.680
 If you read it 

00:03:49.550 --> 00:03:56.240
 What's the problem? 

00:03:51.680 --> 00:04:02.690
 It must be Jesus that music really sleeps with sound. 

00:03:56.240 --> 00:04:03.320
 4 Broadcasters are actually doing a lot of hard work to figure out fights 

00:04:02.690 --> 00:04:09.170
 It's not the same. 

00:04:03.320 --> 00:04:12.830
 Rather than emphasizing visual things by lighting or lighting firecrackers 

00:04:09.170 --> 00:04:17.720
 I think it's much more of an advertisement. 

00:04:12.830 --> 00:04:21.670
 It's a program called Well- Kahn Idol, 

00:04:17.720 --> 00:04:25.560
 If you listen to the sound of music playing program 

00:04:21.670 --> 00:04:31.370
 It sounds almost like listening to music 2 pers. 

00:04:25.560 --> 00:04:35.900
 I do not get these things at all, 

00:04:31.370 --> 00:04:35.900
 I feel a sense of despair . 

00:04:38.580 --> 00:04:40.580
 Ah

00:04:44.670 --> 00:04:53.940

00:04:51.300 --> 00:04:57.650
 Oh, there'll'd Deer 

00:04:53.940 --> 00:04:57.650

 There is no jaw on the floor when the secretariat is opened . 

00:05:02.490 --> 00:05:07.249
 You've got an attribute. 

00:05:07.699 --> 00:05:14.870
 Yes, I did. 

00:05:10.310 --> 00:05:15.740
 I think when we write the position of the n Jenny to one side of one donation system 

00:05:14.870 --> 00:05:21.520

00:05:15.740 --> 00:05:26.570

00:05:35.120 --> 00:05:46.790
 I'm definitely an idealist I want to be an idealist dreaming of four 

00:05:41.720 --> 00:05:51.410
 What I can do without getting tired is to love my music 

00:05:46.790 --> 00:05:56.000
 As people are constantly flogging , 

00:05:51.410 --> 00:06:01.030
 For better use of popular music that can be enjoyed by the 

00:05:56.000 --> 00:06:06.099
 Reinforcing little by little and hers suggesting again
