00:00:06.379 --> 00:00:11.120
 It's an exhibition that has been around many times 

00:00:08.610 --> 00:00:13.620
 Criticism has evoked body worlds 

00:00:11.120 --> 00:00:15.780
 human plastinates for eternity 

00:00:13.620 --> 00:00:17.670
 preserved it is now with one 

00:00:15.780 --> 00:00:20.820
 special focus offenbach the 

00:00:17.670 --> 00:00:23.189
 cycle of life from 6 to death 

00:00:20.820 --> 00:00:24.779
 resurrection and decay of life 

00:00:23.189 --> 00:00:26.640
 but why do people sign up 

00:00:24.779 --> 00:00:28.970
 voluntarily to a body donation after 

00:00:26.640 --> 00:00:28.970
 her death 

00:00:32.500 --> 00:00:36.190
 and of course I am very much 

00:00:34.240 --> 00:00:38.440
 learned about my body i was very 

00:00:36.190 --> 00:00:40.920
 anxious but also very unhealthy lived 

00:00:38.440 --> 00:00:42.750
 and could 

00:00:40.920 --> 00:00:44.670
 take out so much for me 

00:00:42.750 --> 00:00:47.129
 sanitary i have the fear of it 

00:00:44.670 --> 00:00:48.690
 I can overcome death quite well 

00:00:47.129 --> 00:00:50.460
 would have helped me with the accident victim before 

00:00:48.690 --> 00:00:50.850
 that is no topic for me now 

00:00:50.460 --> 00:00:52.620
 more 

00:00:50.850 --> 00:00:55.379
 So the topic of death has me so 

00:00:52.620 --> 00:00:57.149
 busy and touched and i have like that 

00:00:55.379 --> 00:00:59.219
 learned a lot that I'm under hagens 

00:00:57.149 --> 00:01:00.780
 also like to give something back and 

00:00:59.219 --> 00:01:02.489
 I 'll be dead later in the 

00:01:00.780 --> 00:01:04.259
 exhibition stand and they perhaps 

00:01:02.489 --> 00:01:06.149
 always my smokers and I say 

00:01:04.259 --> 00:01:08.580
 I learned something I also hear 

00:01:06.149 --> 00:01:10.229
 It all works very well for me 

00:01:08.580 --> 00:01:12.210
 hagen that is the man who the 

00:01:10.229 --> 00:01:14.640
 plastination invented its first 

00:01:12.210 --> 00:01:16.619
 exhibition 19 95 in tokio had and 

00:01:14.640 --> 00:01:18.090
 Visitors have always loved it 

00:01:16.619 --> 00:01:21.619
 sandy plastinates and art and the 

00:01:18.090 --> 00:01:21.619
 Science We asked his wife 

00:01:32.360 --> 00:01:37.620
 made 

00:01:34.650 --> 00:01:41.160
 he does not understand himself as being 

00:01:37.620 --> 00:01:45.330
 artist but as anatom and has 

00:01:41.160 --> 00:01:47.010
 realized that to work for the laity 

00:01:45.330 --> 00:01:49.440
 it is necessary the passionate 

00:01:47.010 --> 00:01:51.150
 to represent aesthetically as possible 

00:01:49.440 --> 00:01:53.150
 and we also learned about the time 

00:01:51.150 --> 00:01:55.830
 that it is necessary but that it is 

00:01:53.150 --> 00:01:59.550
 Preparations moving special brands 

00:01:55.830 --> 00:02:00.720
 look if you live like that 

00:01:59.550 --> 00:02:02.700
 be picked 

00:02:00.720 --> 00:02:04.200
 are there any plans like yourself? 

00:02:02.700 --> 00:02:06.370
 be presented after his death 

00:02:04.200 --> 00:02:08.080
 would like to 

00:02:06.370 --> 00:02:11.240
 I missed people I have no 

00:02:08.080 --> 00:02:13.100
 special wishes i am 

00:02:11.240 --> 00:02:15.380
 with body and soul first I am glad 

00:02:13.100 --> 00:02:17.690
 that I'm in this niche 

00:02:15.380 --> 00:02:20.290
 an activity field, so to speak 

00:02:17.690 --> 00:02:22.790
 have what is incredibly exciting but 

00:02:20.290 --> 00:02:25.300
 also something very valuable at the same time 

00:02:22.790 --> 00:02:27.560
 the people are giving this 

00:02:25.300 --> 00:02:29.120
 self-understanding and their own 

00:02:27.560 --> 00:02:32.210
 this other view on the 

00:02:29.120 --> 00:02:34.580
 physicality as invites and we 

00:02:32.210 --> 00:02:36.670
 to make people live healthier lives 

00:02:34.580 --> 00:02:40.010
 to live differently 

00:02:36.670 --> 00:02:42.710
 that satisfies me greatly 

00:02:40.010 --> 00:02:44.600
 28 whole body plastinates and countless 

00:02:42.710 --> 00:02:46.370
 organs and discs is the offenbacher 

00:02:44.600 --> 00:02:48.260
 Body Worlds exhibition bigger than that 

00:02:46.370 --> 00:02:50.170
 last in frankfurt or munich and 

00:02:48.260 --> 00:02:52.460
 definitely worth seeing 

00:02:50.170 --> 00:02:54.080
 and even if the sculptures used to be 

00:02:52.460 --> 00:02:55.490
 once lived so acted 

00:02:54.080 --> 00:02:58.390
 in the end just how detailed 

00:02:55.490 --> 00:02:58.390
 the plastic
