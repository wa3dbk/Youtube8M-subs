00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.179
 yes 

00:00:04.380 --> 00:00:13.440
 and it made the snow and let's start 

00:00:06.900 --> 00:00:16.560
 make snowmen but let's go 

00:00:13.440 --> 00:00:20.340
 first to the list of materials 

00:00:16.560 --> 00:00:23.520
 for the snowman we need base 

00:00:20.340 --> 00:00:28.400
 wooden with pedestal three balls 

00:00:23.520 --> 00:00:33.809
 unicel buttons white diamond 

00:00:28.400 --> 00:00:36.470
 white glue fomin felt gun and 

00:00:33.809 --> 00:00:36.470
 silicone bars 

00:00:36.850 --> 00:00:41.649
 but we have already seen the material and 

00:00:39.489 --> 00:00:43.690
 we also have the button on the 

00:00:41.649 --> 00:00:45.789
 creativity so I'll start by 

00:00:43.690 --> 00:00:49.149
 give them a tip what we discover from the 

00:00:45.789 --> 00:00:52.059
 last time by luck but the point here 

00:00:49.149 --> 00:00:55.589
 is going to be cast the diamond in a 

00:00:52.059 --> 00:00:55.589
 larger bag than where they will fit 

00:00:58.690 --> 00:01:03.800
 close of diamond our drops of 

00:01:01.970 --> 00:01:05.550
 anis the one that we are going to put glue 

00:01:03.800 --> 00:01:09.170
 White 

00:01:05.550 --> 00:01:09.170
 pretty w 

00:01:09.870 --> 00:01:14.580
 exactly snowman they are going to 

00:01:12.390 --> 00:01:16.590
 make three balls from the big one to the most 

00:01:14.580 --> 00:01:18.630
 little way is also you inserted 

00:01:16.590 --> 00:01:20.330
 in our wooden base as before 

00:01:18.630 --> 00:01:22.610
 decorating 

00:01:20.330 --> 00:01:24.370
 here the advantage is that they are white 

00:01:22.610 --> 00:01:26.690
 what I 'm going to do is a little 

00:01:24.370 --> 00:01:29.960
 I want to make the dance 

00:01:26.690 --> 00:01:31.100
 Caritas a whole hat should stay 

00:01:29.960 --> 00:01:32.810
 whole 

00:01:31.100 --> 00:01:35.190
 yes because generally the dolls of 

00:01:32.810 --> 00:01:40.180
 snow makes them comfortable 

00:01:35.190 --> 00:01:41.710
 his nose or spout is external he adds 

00:01:40.180 --> 00:01:44.800
 and while I for that I'm going to teach 

00:01:41.710 --> 00:01:45.820
 how we have to make the hole to me 

00:01:44.800 --> 00:01:48.290
 it happens to me that we can do it with something 

00:01:45.820 --> 00:01:50.030
 hot and it would be much simpler 

00:01:48.290 --> 00:01:51.990
 but if our also with our great 

00:01:50.030 --> 00:01:54.450
 force 

00:01:51.990 --> 00:01:57.500
 nothing more accurate and careful not to leave 

00:01:54.450 --> 00:01:57.500
 in 20 minutes 

00:01:57.570 --> 00:02:03.720
 a ball of unicel this is going to be the 

00:02:00.990 --> 00:02:06.140
 you need the hat already after buoy 

00:02:03.720 --> 00:02:09.570
 All this we can do now if you 

00:02:06.140 --> 00:02:12.410
 to your liking with this technique is going to be very 

00:02:09.570 --> 00:02:15.370
 quickly erase them from 

00:02:12.410 --> 00:02:15.370
 the diamond 

00:02:16.370 --> 00:02:20.590
 while oceans are drying up 

00:02:24.110 --> 00:02:32.150
 will not bring the base closer so that 

00:02:26.210 --> 00:02:34.000
 fences placing 500 here we already have 

00:02:32.150 --> 00:02:37.010
 the biggest 

00:02:34.000 --> 00:02:42.319
 well plump 

00:02:37.010 --> 00:02:42.319
 of adamantine and I'm going to insert it 

00:02:42.540 --> 00:02:48.300
 is 

00:02:44.700 --> 00:02:50.959
 and then there's the next one and we're going to 

00:02:48.300 --> 00:02:50.959
 go by sizes 

00:02:53.660 --> 00:02:56.660
 Y 

00:02:57.280 --> 00:03:02.020
 and the best thing is that after doing 

00:02:59.709 --> 00:03:04.810
 this is going to make you sexy as 

00:03:02.020 --> 00:03:06.220
 ninel commented with all his glitter 

00:03:04.810 --> 00:03:08.350
 I have to wash my hands if I do not 

00:03:06.220 --> 00:03:10.060
 then they fall out less realistic to me 

00:03:08.350 --> 00:03:12.850
 give birth here but you're ready to 

00:03:10.060 --> 00:03:15.510
 in front and to dance they give to the husband 

00:03:12.850 --> 00:03:17.790
 to the boyfriend or neighbor 

00:03:15.510 --> 00:03:19.790
 and it occurs to me that we can put 

00:03:17.790 --> 00:03:22.620
 also the terms the little soldier 

00:03:19.790 --> 00:03:25.909
 we can go decorating it with little buttons 

00:03:22.620 --> 00:03:25.909
 colors we go 

00:03:28.410 --> 00:03:33.520
 and the father red on the also that 

00:03:32.080 --> 00:03:35.650
 we can put it like a little snow 

00:03:33.520 --> 00:03:37.930
 maybe use the base also of 

00:03:35.650 --> 00:03:40.540
 white to do to do everything else me 

00:03:37.930 --> 00:03:42.390
 proactive internal I will defeat this 

00:03:40.540 --> 00:03:45.040
 painting 

00:03:42.390 --> 00:03:47.549
 I come from this side 

00:03:45.040 --> 00:03:47.549
 so 

00:03:51.030 --> 00:03:57.150
 I do not think I'm going with him right now 

00:03:55.110 --> 00:04:01.250
 when the stay of handyman 

00:03:57.150 --> 00:04:05.360
 we also match him and his little face 

00:04:01.250 --> 00:04:07.730
 we can do the hands with me 

00:04:05.360 --> 00:04:10.880
 occurs with a branch with a stick 

00:04:07.730 --> 00:04:15.600
 what can we bring these other 

00:04:10.880 --> 00:04:19.770
 affirms this activity and does not 

00:04:15.600 --> 00:04:21.590
 little things where this woman from 

00:04:19.770 --> 00:04:30.380
 that those same stars are not good for 

00:04:21.590 --> 00:04:30.380
 clear to decorate the base does not rain 

00:04:34.000 --> 00:04:40.090
 others 

00:04:36.720 --> 00:04:45.360
 effects that more defects to do 

00:04:40.090 --> 00:04:45.360
 a unique theater show to their children 

00:04:45.760 --> 00:04:50.740
 you today is great being you 

00:04:48.700 --> 00:04:52.560
 help something make the handsome shigetaka 

00:04:50.740 --> 00:04:54.760
 of about two reasons because if not well 

00:04:52.560 --> 00:04:57.340
 finishing making the hat but if 

00:04:54.760 --> 00:04:59.050
 it seems to them we are going to see the step by step and 

00:04:57.340 --> 00:05:01.050
 we come back to see how we finished it 

00:04:59.050 --> 00:05:04.889
 It seems 

00:05:01.050 --> 00:05:06.300
 by way of elaboration covers some of 

00:05:04.889 --> 00:05:09.210
 unicel with white glue and 

00:05:06.300 --> 00:05:11.280
 Breaded with diamond strings 

00:05:09.210 --> 00:05:13.530
 the three balls from big to small in the 

00:05:11.280 --> 00:05:16.319
 wooden post and stick the buttons on the 

00:05:13.530 --> 00:05:18.720
 opposite uses two black buttons 

00:05:16.319 --> 00:05:22.289
 to put eyes on your two short doll 

00:05:18.720 --> 00:05:27.089
 wires and place them like little arms 

00:05:22.289 --> 00:05:28.229
 chan chan chan chan was already finished and 

00:05:27.089 --> 00:05:30.749
 say you did not finish the truth is that 

00:05:28.229 --> 00:05:34.289
 I have more work than me but for very 

00:05:30.749 --> 00:05:37.979
 very good that you stayed and set aside everything 

00:05:34.289 --> 00:05:42.949
 Nose nose is not there I can 

00:05:37.979 --> 00:05:45.949
 make to taste if flat nose nose wow 

00:05:42.949 --> 00:05:45.949
 surgery 

00:05:49.990 --> 00:05:57.150
 and what name will we kill him 

00:05:52.150 --> 00:05:57.150
 vilero is going to call bush 

00:05:57.310 --> 00:06:03.030
 snowman water aside all 

00:06:00.940 --> 00:06:05.200
 it's very easy we do not need to have this 

00:06:03.030 --> 00:06:06.850
 some ways to make hats 

00:06:05.200 --> 00:06:09.400
 we just have to grab our 

00:06:06.850 --> 00:06:13.840
 clipped felt and then we started 

00:06:09.400 --> 00:06:15.730
 design and invent unseen I think we 

00:06:13.840 --> 00:06:18.430
 missing a star on that side but 

00:06:15.730 --> 00:06:20.530
 well that's a thing of pasadena stuffed 

00:06:18.430 --> 00:06:23.290
 part of the creativity so is that with 

00:06:20.530 --> 00:06:25.240
 this we finished the first craft 

00:06:23.290 --> 00:06:29.400
 we go a short cut and we come back because 

00:06:25.240 --> 00:06:29.400
 the program is great I changed it
