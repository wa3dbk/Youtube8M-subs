00:00:00.230 --> 00:00:05.190
 magazine cellphone friends we are still 

00:00:03.389 --> 00:00:06.720
 huawei event and we are with that 

00:00:05.190 --> 00:00:09.269
 which is probably the object most 

00:00:06.720 --> 00:00:10.950
 interesting of the three wearables presented 

00:00:09.269 --> 00:00:13.650
 or the whale watch 

00:00:10.950 --> 00:00:15.509
 it is a real watch 

00:00:13.650 --> 00:00:19.430
 they insisted a lot on this 

00:00:15.509 --> 00:00:21.950
 on the fact that it was carried out 

00:00:19.430 --> 00:00:25.550
 just like one makes a watch 

00:00:21.950 --> 00:00:28.910
 normal and therefore starting from a concept 

00:00:25.550 --> 00:00:32.000
 of design that resumes to that of the 

00:00:28.910 --> 00:00:34.430
 traditional clocks and a design that 

00:00:32.000 --> 00:00:37.160
 resists over time this is what it is 

00:00:34.430 --> 00:00:39.230
 been said then we can note 

00:00:37.160 --> 00:00:42.710
 meanwhile, if then widen the field that there 

00:00:39.230 --> 00:00:44.989
 there are many straps available at 

00:00:42.710 --> 00:00:47.900
 this part there are those in leather 

00:00:44.989 --> 00:00:49.910
 imitation leather but there will also be those in 

00:00:47.900 --> 00:00:53.060
 metal and the watch is meant for 

00:00:49.910 --> 00:00:56.890
 to adapt both to a man's arm and 

00:00:53.060 --> 00:00:59.300
 the arm of a gentle girl e 

00:00:56.890 --> 00:01:01.700
 then what else to say 

00:00:59.300 --> 00:01:05.660
 will have android web as the operating system 

00:01:01.700 --> 00:01:08.660
 will have a 14-inch display with 

00:01:05.660 --> 00:01:12.649
 resolution of 400 x 400 sapphire crystal 

00:01:08.660 --> 00:01:15.590
 therefore resistant to shocks and anything else 

00:01:12.649 --> 00:01:18.400
 capacity of course thanks to all the 

00:01:15.590 --> 00:01:20.820
 sensors d 

00:01:18.400 --> 00:01:24.550
 counts downwards to calculate sleep cycles 

00:01:20.820 --> 00:01:27.400
 realizing you are running and others 

00:01:24.550 --> 00:01:29.500
 functionality of this type is also from 

00:01:27.400 --> 00:01:32.380
 don't forget the presence of a 

00:01:29.500 --> 00:01:33.730
 sensor back here for detection 

00:01:32.380 --> 00:01:38.290
 of heart rate 

00:01:33.730 --> 00:01:42.720
 then ivan when you will be received with 

00:01:38.290 --> 00:01:42.720
 the famous with the color is the logio 

00:01:45.150 --> 00:01:49.530
 I remember leaving something to me too 

00:01:50.100 --> 00:01:54.700
 compared to the other two wearables of the 

00:01:53.110 --> 00:01:57.600
 which was announced the 

00:01:54.700 --> 00:01:59.979
 availability on this huawei watch 

00:01:57.600 --> 00:02:03.130
 they remained a little more vague 

00:01:59.979 --> 00:02:04.869
 they talked about half of the year but 

00:02:03.130 --> 00:02:07.810
 they have not given a precise date or not 

00:02:04.869 --> 00:02:10.360
 they even gave an official price 

00:02:07.810 --> 00:02:13.120
 reference therefore how much it costs not 

00:02:10.360 --> 00:02:17.020
 we know, however, we can say that yes 

00:02:13.120 --> 00:02:21.970
 it's an object that we like that it has 

00:02:17.020 --> 00:02:24.100
 a design that surely reminds many 

00:02:21.970 --> 00:02:26.580
 normal watches that's what I was doing 

00:02:24.100 --> 00:02:29.830
 forgetting there are over forty 

00:02:26.580 --> 00:02:32.440
 customizations of the gela watch face 

00:02:29.830 --> 00:02:35.020
 with also the possibility to see i 

00:02:32.440 --> 00:02:39.330
 lunar cycles and then decide what 

00:02:35.020 --> 00:02:39.330
 having in the siena's various stamps 

00:02:40.110 --> 00:02:43.750
 in fact now we will do everything to 

00:02:42.280 --> 00:02:44.680
 look for Italy 's midday species 

00:02:43.750 --> 00:02:46.960
 to take it away 

00:02:44.680 --> 00:02:49.450
 okay at the height of my cuddly 

00:02:46.960 --> 00:02:52.930
 million won that surely the 

00:02:49.450 --> 00:02:55.510
 end of this fair will come from 

00:02:52.930 --> 00:02:58.350
 lucio e from ivan is everything to the next 

00:02:55.510 --> 00:02:58.350
