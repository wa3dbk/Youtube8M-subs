fresh groups of Marines really wants to
keep<00:00:18.150> those<00:00:18.270> vessels<00:00:18.869> live<00:00:19.020> I'd<00:00:19.230> be<00:00:19.380> worried

00:00:19.609 --> 00:00:19.619 
keep those vessels live I'd be worried

00:00:19.619 --> 00:00:21.830 
keep those vessels live I'd be worried
about<00:00:19.680> discourages<00:00:20.369> if<00:00:20.490> I<00:00:20.609> were<00:00:20.730> him<00:00:20.850> I'm<00:00:21.660> not

00:00:21.830 --> 00:00:21.840 
about discourages if I were him I'm not

about discourages if I were him I'm not
sure<00:00:21.900> how<00:00:22.170> many<00:00:22.230> scooters<00:00:22.529> are<00:00:22.769> out<00:00:22.920> in<00:00:23.010> the

00:00:23.029 --> 00:00:23.039 
sure how many scooters are out in the

00:00:23.039 --> 00:00:24.679 
sure how many scooters are out in the
field<00:00:23.100> I<00:00:23.400> think<00:00:23.699> he's<00:00:24.000> got<00:00:24.150> this<00:00:24.240> engineering

00:00:24.679 --> 00:00:24.689 
field I think he's got this engineering

00:00:24.689 --> 00:00:26.029 
field I think he's got this engineering
Bay<00:00:24.779> so<00:00:24.930> he<00:00:25.019> has<00:00:25.170> spotted<00:00:25.590> this<00:00:25.769> little

00:00:26.029 --> 00:00:26.039 
Bay so he has spotted this little

00:00:26.039 --> 00:00:28.220 
Bay so he has spotted this little
cluster<00:00:26.400> of<00:00:26.430> so<00:00:26.609> forces<00:00:27.000> vessels<00:00:27.900> moving

00:00:28.220 --> 00:00:28.230 
cluster of so forces vessels moving

00:00:28.230 --> 00:00:31.250 
cluster of so forces vessels moving
enough<00:00:28.529> and<00:00:28.769> this<00:00:29.550> is<00:00:30.060> to<00:00:30.420> store<00:00:31.019> them<00:00:31.140> but

00:00:31.250 --> 00:00:31.260 
enough and this is to store them but

00:00:31.260 --> 00:00:32.600 
enough and this is to store them but
he's<00:00:31.349> already<00:00:31.500> of<00:00:31.769> the<00:00:31.949> important<00:00:32.369> stuff<00:00:32.550> to

00:00:32.600 --> 00:00:32.610 
he's already of the important stuff to

00:00:32.610 --> 00:00:34.420 
he's already of the important stuff to
the<00:00:32.940> file<00:00:33.090> is<00:00:33.210> going<00:00:33.360> to<00:00:33.420> go<00:00:33.510> down<00:00:33.540> and<00:00:33.989> the

00:00:34.420 --> 00:00:34.430 
the file is going to go down and the

00:00:34.430 --> 00:00:36.290 
the file is going to go down and the
ocean<00:00:35.430> this<00:00:35.550> looks<00:00:35.730> like<00:00:35.820> is<00:00:35.940> going<00:00:35.969> to<00:00:36.120> take<00:00:36.270> a

ocean this looks like is going to take a

00:00:36.300 --> 00:00:37.580 
ocean this looks like is going to take a
number<00:00:36.480> of<00:00:36.690> servings<00:00:36.989> with<00:00:37.200> it<00:00:37.350> as<00:00:37.469> that

00:00:37.580 --> 00:00:37.590 
number of servings with it as that

00:00:37.590 --> 00:00:41.660 
number of servings with it as that
happens<00:00:39.170> dedicated<00:00:40.170> Marine<00:00:40.770> Force<00:00:41.309> down<00:00:41.489> in

00:00:41.660 --> 00:00:41.670

happens dedicated Marine Force down in
the<00:00:41.730> expansion<00:00:42.030> just<00:00:42.300> now<00:00:42.530> five<00:00:43.530> at<00:00:43.739> all<00:00:43.980> and

00:00:44.180 --> 00:00:44.190 
the expansion just now five at all and

00:00:45.590 --> 00:00:45.600 
the servants being taken out I think

00:00:45.600 --> 00:00:47.150 
the servants being taken out I think
we'll<00:00:46.410> be<00:00:46.440> able<00:00:46.590> to<00:00:46.680> take<00:00:46.829> out<00:00:46.950> the<00:00:47.039> suspension

00:00:47.150 --> 00:00:47.160 
we'll be able to take out the suspension

00:00:47.160 --> 00:00:48.979 
we'll be able to take out the suspension
here<00:00:47.640> fee<00:00:47.820> if<00:00:48.030> he<00:00:48.149> attacks<00:00:48.600> it<00:00:48.719> for<00:00:48.870> long

all of the Marines as well so it doesn't
even<00:00:58.649> take<00:00:58.920> out<00:00:59.100> the<00:00:59.280> hatchery<00:00:59.670> a<00:00:59.960> DHD<00:01:00.960> just

all that already ate going off at least

00:01:10.560 --> 00:01:12.649 
all that already ate going off at least
it<00:01:10.680> can<00:01:10.799> stem<00:01:11.400> the<00:01:11.430> tide<00:01:11.790> of<00:01:11.820> olas<00:01:12.330> at<00:01:12.510> this

00:01:12.649 --> 00:01:12.659 
it can stem the tide of olas at this

00:01:12.659 --> 00:01:15.260 
it can stem the tide of olas at this
point<00:01:12.930> his<00:01:13.710> macro<00:01:14.070> has<00:01:14.220> been<00:01:14.670> really<00:01:14.939> good<00:01:15.090> but

00:01:15.260 --> 00:01:15.270 
point his macro has been really good but

00:01:15.270 --> 00:01:17.240 
point his macro has been really good but
he's<00:01:15.390> run<00:01:15.600> out<00:01:15.630> of<00:01:15.830> experimentals<00:01:16.830> here<00:01:17.100> a

he's run out of experimentals here a
natural<00:01:18.180> and<00:01:18.420> it<00:01:18.540> is<00:01:18.659> made<00:01:18.840> so<00:01:19.229> it's<00:01:19.350> really

00:01:19.490 --> 00:01:19.500 
natural and it is made so it's really

00:02:36.680 --> 00:02:36.690 
killing all the plague marines so I'm

00:02:36.690 --> 00:02:38.870 
killing all the plague marines so I'm
down<00:02:36.900> again<00:02:37.380> still<00:02:38.280> not<00:02:38.430> able<00:02:38.520> to<00:02:38.670> take<00:02:38.700> out

the<00:02:38.940> hatchery<00:02:39.330> maybe<00:02:39.870> that<00:02:40.140> maybe<00:02:40.470> retching

00:02:40.850 --> 00:02:40.860 
the hatchery maybe that maybe retching

00:02:40.860 --> 00:02:42.290 
the hatchery maybe that maybe retching
just<00:02:41.070> gone<00:02:41.280> for<00:02:41.490> an<00:02:41.550> entire<00:02:41.850> straight<00:02:42.120> through

00:02:42.290 --> 00:02:42.300 
just gone for an entire straight through

00:02:42.300 --> 00:02:44.870 
just gone for an entire straight through
and<00:02:42.330> hit<00:02:42.750> the<00:02:42.840> hatchery<00:02:43.170> but<00:02:43.550> really<00:02:44.550> he's

00:02:44.870 --> 00:02:44.880 
and hit the hatchery but really he's

00:02:44.880 --> 00:02:46.400 
and hit the hatchery but really he's
playing<00:02:45.150> quite<00:02:45.390> conservatively<00:02:45.960> here<00:02:46.260> and

00:02:46.400 --> 00:02:46.410 
playing quite conservatively here and

00:02:46.410 --> 00:02:48.710 
playing quite conservatively here and
yes<00:02:47.280> I<00:02:47.490> think<00:02:47.730> some<00:02:47.910> more<00:02:48.090> aggressive<00:02:48.480> players

00:02:48.710 --> 00:02:48.720 
yes I think some more aggressive players

00:02:48.720 --> 00:02:50.420 
yes I think some more aggressive players
call<00:02:48.960> for<00:02:49.200> when<00:02:49.740> he<00:02:49.950> is<00:02:50.010> trying<00:02:50.280> to<00:02:50.370> be

00:02:50.420 --> 00:02:50.430 
call for when he is trying to be

00:02:50.430 --> 00:02:52.760 
call for when he is trying to be
aggressive<00:02:50.520> but<00:02:51.110> gotta<00:02:52.110> be<00:02:52.230> ultra<00:02:52.590> aggressive

00:02:52.760 --> 00:02:52.770 
aggressive but gotta be ultra aggressive

00:02:52.770 --> 00:02:54.670 
aggressive but gotta be ultra aggressive
and<00:02:53.160> just<00:02:53.400> take<00:02:53.610> hatcheries<00:02:54.090> out<00:02:54.240> I<00:02:54.270> think

00:02:54.670 --> 00:02:54.680 
and just take hatcheries out I think

00:02:54.680 --> 00:02:57.320 
and just take hatcheries out I think
it's<00:02:55.680> so<00:02:55.860> it's<00:02:56.100> tough<00:02:56.310> to<00:02:56.459> know<00:02:56.580> I<00:02:56.610> guess<00:02:57.180> I'm

00:02:57.320 --> 00:02:57.330 
it's so it's tough to know I guess I'm

00:02:57.330 --> 00:02:58.670 
it's so it's tough to know I guess I'm
not<00:02:57.360> as<00:02:57.540> good<00:02:57.570> a<00:02:57.720> player<00:02:57.930> as<00:02:57.959> rittle<00:02:58.320> obviously
