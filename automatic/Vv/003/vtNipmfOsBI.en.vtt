00:03:30.480 --> 00:03:32.599 
oh that means they're pretty fresh tire
so<00:03:31.169> if<00:03:31.260> you<00:03:31.349> get<00:03:31.500> a<00:03:31.530> tire<00:03:31.799> and<00:03:32.099> it's<00:03:32.220> a<00:03:32.280> year<00:03:32.519> or

00:03:32.599 --> 00:03:32.609 
so if you get a tire and it's a year or

00:03:32.609 --> 00:03:34.490 
so if you get a tire and it's a year or
two<00:03:32.760> old<00:03:32.970> it'll<00:03:33.329> wear<00:03:33.510> a<00:03:33.540> lot<00:03:33.780> longer<00:03:34.019> because

00:03:34.490 --> 00:03:34.500 
two old it'll wear a lot longer because

00:03:34.500 --> 00:03:36.920 
two old it'll wear a lot longer because
the<00:03:34.650> rubber<00:03:34.859> has<00:03:35.099> cured<00:03:35.519> and<00:03:35.849> has<00:03:36.510> become

00:03:36.920 --> 00:03:36.930 
the rubber has cured and has become

00:03:36.930 --> 00:03:39.080 
the rubber has cured and has become
harder<00:03:37.590> now<00:03:38.160> of<00:03:38.579> course<00:03:38.790> you<00:03:38.910> got<00:03:39.030> the

00:03:39.080 --> 00:03:39.090 
harder now of course you got the

00:03:39.090 --> 00:03:40.670 
harder now of course you got the
opposite

00:03:40.670 --> 00:03:40.680 
opposite

00:03:40.680 --> 00:03:43.280 
opposite
not<00:03:41.670> the<00:03:41.790> opposite<00:03:42.390> but<00:03:42.569> the<00:03:42.689> negative<00:03:43.079> side

00:03:43.280 --> 00:03:43.290 
not the opposite but the negative side

00:03:43.290 --> 00:03:46.250 
not the opposite but the negative side
of<00:03:43.470> that<00:03:43.560> is<00:03:43.879> if<00:03:44.879> you<00:03:45.150> let<00:03:45.750> them<00:03:45.870> sit<00:03:46.049> around

00:03:46.250 --> 00:03:46.260 
of that is if you let them sit around

00:03:46.260 --> 00:03:50.030 
of that is if you let them sit around
for<00:03:46.500> too<00:03:46.680> long<00:03:46.890> they<00:03:47.879> will<00:03:48.780> become<00:03:49.439> well<00:03:49.890> it's

00:03:50.030 --> 00:03:50.040 
for too long they will become well it's

00:03:50.040 --> 00:03:53.059 
for too long they will become well it's
a<00:03:50.129> good<00:03:50.280> idea<00:03:50.400> Tim<00:03:51.140> they<00:03:52.140> will<00:03:52.319> become<00:03:52.799> too

00:03:53.059 --> 00:03:53.069 
a good idea Tim they will become too

00:03:53.069 --> 00:03:55.220 
a good idea Tim they will become too
hard<00:03:53.310> in<00:03:53.489> the<00:03:53.610> sidewall<00:03:54.060> to<00:03:54.180> crack<00:03:54.450> Adam<00:03:54.720> now<00:03:54.900> I

00:03:55.220 --> 00:03:55.230 
hard in the sidewall to crack Adam now I

00:03:55.230 --> 00:03:58.190 
hard in the sidewall to crack Adam now I
got<00:03:55.590> this<00:03:55.739> inner<00:03:55.950> tube<00:03:56.220> that<00:03:56.810> that<00:03:57.810> was<00:03:58.019> in

00:03:58.190 --> 00:03:58.200 
got this inner tube that that was in

00:03:58.200 --> 00:04:03.050 
got this inner tube that that was in
this<00:03:58.439> one<00:03:58.980> and<00:03:59.340> why<00:03:59.519> is<00:03:59.579> this<00:03:59.849> not<00:04:00.090> focusing

00:04:03.050 --> 00:04:03.060 

00:04:03.060 --> 00:04:04.940 

and<00:04:03.150> Timothy<00:04:03.870> has<00:04:03.990> decided<00:04:04.620> that<00:04:04.709> he<00:04:04.830> would

00:04:04.940 --> 00:04:04.950 
and Timothy has decided that he would

00:04:04.950 --> 00:04:07.340 
and Timothy has decided that he would
put<00:04:05.069> the<00:04:05.160> vacuum<00:04:05.550> cleaner<00:04:05.959> what<00:04:06.959> the<00:04:07.080> heck<00:04:07.230> is

00:04:07.340 --> 00:04:07.350 
put the vacuum cleaner what the heck is

00:04:07.350 --> 00:04:10.460 
put the vacuum cleaner what the heck is
wrong<00:04:07.380> with<00:04:07.590> this<00:04:07.800> thing<00:04:08.100> I<00:04:08.370> won't<00:04:08.819> focus<00:04:09.470> all

00:04:10.460 --> 00:04:10.470 
wrong with this thing I won't focus all

00:04:10.470 --> 00:04:11.930 
wrong with this thing I won't focus all
right<00:04:10.680> put<00:04:10.920> the<00:04:10.980> vacuum<00:04:11.340> cleaner<00:04:11.580> on<00:04:11.790> there

00:04:11.930 --> 00:04:11.940 
right put the vacuum cleaner on there

00:04:11.940 --> 00:04:13.830

00:04:24.029 --> 00:04:24.039 
and that is actually working quite well

and that is actually working quite well
I<00:04:25.560> don't<00:04:26.560> want<00:04:26.740> any<00:04:26.949> air<00:04:27.160> into<00:04:27.430> it<00:04:27.789> because<00:04:27.970> I'm

00:04:28.200 --> 00:04:28.210 
I don't want any air into it because I'm

00:04:28.210 --> 00:04:29.760

00:04:32.939 --> 00:04:32.949 
and it's harder to fold it when it's got

00:04:32.949 --> 00:04:34.600 
and it's harder to fold it when it's got
some<00:04:33.190> air<00:04:33.340> into

00:04:34.600 --> 00:04:34.610
