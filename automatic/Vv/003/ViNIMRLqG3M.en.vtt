this is the 2013 version of the cabo
quantum<00:00:19.080> totally<00:00:20.010> redid<00:00:20.310> these<00:00:20.490> reels<00:00:20.930> for

00:00:21.939 --> 00:00:21.949 
quantum totally redid these reels for

2013 you might have fished the old

00:00:24.480 --> 00:00:26.450 
2013 you might have fished the old
school<00:00:24.720> Cabo<00:00:25.500> and<00:00:25.680> love<00:00:26.099> that<00:00:26.279> they're<00:00:26.430> a

00:00:28.009 --> 00:00:28.019 
great real great selling real but they

00:00:28.019 --> 00:00:30.349 
great real great selling real but they
totally<00:00:28.349> redid<00:00:28.740> it<00:00:28.859> so<00:00:28.949> this<00:00:29.039> is<00:00:29.099> not<00:00:30.029> at<00:00:30.210> all

00:00:30.349 --> 00:00:30.359 
totally redid it so this is not at all

00:00:30.359 --> 00:00:32.600 
totally redid it so this is not at all
like<00:00:30.779> the<00:00:30.810> the<00:00:31.529> old<00:00:31.679> Cabo<00:00:32.130> they<00:00:32.279> kept<00:00:32.460> the<00:00:32.579> name

00:00:32.600 --> 00:00:32.610 
like the the old Cabo they kept the name

00:00:32.610 --> 00:00:35.150 
like the the old Cabo they kept the name
for<00:00:33.030> marketing<00:00:33.120> purposes<00:00:33.390> and<00:00:34.110> so<00:00:35.040> that

00:00:35.150 --> 00:00:35.160 
for marketing purposes and so that

00:00:37.340 --> 00:00:37.350 
people knew what it was but this is a

00:00:37.350 --> 00:00:39.229 
people knew what it was but this is a

much different reel you know you got the

00:00:39.239 --> 00:00:40.850 
much different reel you know you got the
all<00:00:39.360> metal<00:00:39.540> body<00:00:39.690> so<00:00:40.230> it's<00:00:40.350> nice<00:00:40.500> and<00:00:40.530> light

00:00:40.850 --> 00:00:40.860 
all metal body so it's nice and light

00:00:40.860 --> 00:00:43.520 
all metal body so it's nice and light
thirteen<00:00:41.820> point<00:00:42.059> nine<00:00:42.120> ounces<00:00:42.719> I<00:00:42.930> should<00:00:43.379> say

00:00:43.520 --> 00:00:43.530 
thirteen point nine ounces I should say

00:00:43.530 --> 00:00:45.229 
thirteen point nine ounces I should say
this<00:00:43.680> is<00:00:43.739> a<00:00:43.860> saltwater<00:00:44.309> really<00:00:44.610> you<00:00:44.760> know<00:00:44.850> most

00:00:45.229 --> 00:00:45.239 
this is a saltwater really you know most

00:00:45.239 --> 00:00:46.520 
this is a saltwater really you know most
companies<00:00:45.390> they<00:00:45.690> put<00:00:45.809> the<00:00:45.899> blue<00:00:46.079> on<00:00:46.260> there<00:00:46.379> to

00:00:46.520 --> 00:00:46.530 
companies they put the blue on there to

00:00:46.530 --> 00:00:47.600 
companies they put the blue on there to
indicate<00:00:46.649> that<00:00:46.890> this<00:00:47.070> is<00:00:47.190> a<00:00:47.219> more<00:00:47.489> of<00:00:47.550> a

00:00:47.600 --> 00:00:47.610 
indicate that this is a more of a

00:00:47.610 --> 00:00:49.910 
indicate that this is a more of a
saltwater<00:00:48.030> real<00:00:48.530> you<00:00:49.530> can<00:00:49.649> use<00:00:49.770> in<00:00:49.890> a

00:00:49.910 --> 00:00:49.920 
saltwater real you can use in a

00:00:49.920 --> 00:00:51.590 
saltwater real you can use in a
freshwater<00:00:50.340> but<00:00:50.520> it<00:00:50.640> is<00:00:50.730> built<00:00:50.969> for<00:00:51.059> saltwater

00:00:51.590 --> 00:00:51.600 
freshwater but it is built for saltwater

00:00:51.600 --> 00:00:53.420 
freshwater but it is built for saltwater
and<00:00:51.960> that<00:00:52.170> being<00:00:52.410> said<00:00:52.590> it<00:00:52.770> puts<00:00:53.010> out<00:00:53.129> thirty

00:00:53.420 --> 00:00:53.430 
and that being said it puts out thirty

00:00:53.430 --> 00:00:55.220 
and that being said it puts out thirty
pounds<00:00:53.789> of<00:00:53.879> drag<00:00:54.059> so<00:00:54.750> you're<00:00:54.840> looking<00:00:54.960> at<00:00:55.170> a

00:00:55.220 --> 00:00:55.230 
pounds of drag so you're looking at a

00:00:55.230 --> 00:00:57.260 
pounds of drag so you're looking at a
forty<00:00:55.649> size<00:00:55.890> reel<00:00:56.250> with<00:00:56.550> thirty<00:00:56.850> pounds<00:00:57.210> of

00:00:57.260 --> 00:00:57.270 
forty size reel with thirty pounds of

00:00:57.270 --> 00:00:58.459 
forty size reel with thirty pounds of
drag<00:00:57.449> so<00:00:57.690> there's<00:00:57.840> nothing<00:00:58.020> you<00:00:58.289> know<00:00:58.379> if

00:00:58.459 --> 00:00:58.469 
drag so there's nothing you know if

00:00:58.469 --> 00:01:00.709 
drag so there's nothing you know if
you're<00:00:58.590> fishing<00:00:58.890> saltwater<00:00:59.340> inshore<00:00:59.910> there

00:01:00.709 --> 00:01:00.719 
you're fishing saltwater inshore there

00:01:00.719 --> 00:01:02.060 
you're fishing saltwater inshore there
is<00:01:00.870> nothing<00:01:01.230> that<00:01:01.350> you<00:01:01.440> can't<00:01:01.620> reel<00:01:01.770> in<00:01:01.920> with

00:01:02.060 --> 00:01:02.070 
is nothing that you can't reel in with

00:01:02.070 --> 00:01:03.979 
is nothing that you can't reel in with
this<00:01:02.160> reel<00:01:02.370> it's<00:01:03.000> nice<00:01:03.149> and<00:01:03.329> smooth<00:01:03.539> it's<00:01:03.870> got

00:01:03.979 --> 00:01:03.989 
this reel it's nice and smooth it's got

00:01:03.989 --> 00:01:05.450 
this reel it's nice and smooth it's got
eight<00:01:04.110> ball<00:01:04.350> bearings<00:01:04.710> they've<00:01:05.040> got<00:01:05.189> the<00:01:05.280> nice

00:01:18.679 --> 00:01:18.689 
styling on the reels made them look a

00:01:18.689 --> 00:01:20.200 
styling on the reels made them look a
little<00:01:18.869> bit<00:01:19.049> different<00:01:19.409> from<00:01:19.530> the<00:01:19.619> standard

they've lightened it up a little bit you
can<00:01:28.590> see<00:01:28.710> all<00:01:28.829> the<00:01:28.920> cutouts<00:01:29.130> and<00:01:29.460> stuff<00:01:29.670> like

00:01:29.810 --> 00:01:29.820

can see all the cutouts and stuff like
that<00:01:30.030> great<00:01:30.869> drag<00:01:31.110> system<00:01:31.350> like<00:01:31.500> I<00:01:31.590> said<00:01:31.740> 30

00:01:31.940 --> 00:01:31.950 
that great drag system like I said 30

00:01:31.950 --> 00:01:34.640 
that great drag system like I said 30
pounds<00:01:32.250> drag<00:01:32.520> you<00:01:33.329> know<00:01:33.360> infinite<00:01:34.170> you<00:01:34.500> can

00:01:34.640 --> 00:01:34.650 
pounds drag you know infinite you can

00:01:34.650 --> 00:01:37.910 
pounds drag you know infinite you can
hear<00:01:34.829> all<00:01:34.950> the<00:01:34.979> clicks<00:01:35.250> in<00:01:35.460> there<00:01:36.500> it's<00:01:37.500> really

00:01:37.910 --> 00:01:37.920 
hear all the clicks in there it's really

00:01:37.920 --> 00:01:39.770 
hear all the clicks in there it's really
smooth<00:01:38.159> really<00:01:38.490> nice<00:01:38.759> it's<00:01:39.000> got<00:01:39.119> this<00:01:39.390> the
