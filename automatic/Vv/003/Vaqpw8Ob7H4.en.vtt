the<00:06:19.200> perimeter<00:06:19.650> of<00:06:19.680> our<00:06:20.010> face<00:06:20.760> and<00:06:21.480> if<00:06:21.990> you<00:06:22.110> can

00:06:22.280 --> 00:06:22.290 
the perimeter of our face and if you can

next<00:06:25.860> to<00:06:25.950> each<00:06:26.070> other<00:06:26.190> I<00:06:26.690> pinched<00:06:27.690> and<00:06:27.930> turned

00:06:28.250 --> 00:06:28.260 
next to each other I pinched and turned

00:06:28.260 --> 00:06:29.900 
next to each other I pinched and turned
the<00:06:28.500> bottom<00:06:28.830> of<00:06:28.920> slightly<00:06:29.310> and<00:06:29.550> glued<00:06:29.760> them

00:06:29.900 --> 00:06:29.910 
the bottom of slightly and glued them

00:06:29.910 --> 00:06:32.690 
the bottom of slightly and glued them
down<00:06:30.470> we're<00:06:31.470> going<00:06:31.620> to<00:06:31.710> continue<00:06:32.220> like<00:06:32.400> this

00:06:32.690 --> 00:06:32.700 
down we're going to continue like this

00:06:32.700 --> 00:06:35.860 
down we're going to continue like this
all<00:06:33.000> along<00:06:33.570> the<00:06:33.720> perimeter<00:06:33.900> of<00:06:34.200> our<00:06:34.500> heart

00:06:35.860 --> 00:06:35.870 
all along the perimeter of our heart

00:06:35.870 --> 00:06:38.480 
all along the perimeter of our heart
okay<00:06:36.870> so<00:06:36.930> we<00:06:37.410> finished<00:06:37.590> putting<00:06:38.070> the<00:06:38.280> paper

00:06:38.480 --> 00:06:38.490 
okay so we finished putting the paper

00:06:38.490 --> 00:06:40.610 
okay so we finished putting the paper
all<00:06:38.910> around<00:06:39.240> the<00:06:39.390> outside<00:06:39.570> edge<00:06:39.960> of<00:06:40.200> our<00:06:40.380> heart

00:06:40.610 --> 00:06:40.620 
all around the outside edge of our heart

00:06:40.620 --> 00:06:43.820 
all around the outside edge of our heart
shape<00:06:40.860> and<00:06:41.570> I<00:06:42.570> think<00:06:43.290> it<00:06:43.350> looks<00:06:43.500> fantastic

00:06:43.820 --> 00:06:43.830 
shape and I think it looks fantastic

00:06:43.830 --> 00:06:45.730 
shape and I think it looks fantastic
already

00:06:45.730 --> 00:06:45.740 
already

00:06:45.740 --> 00:06:51.079 
already
see<00:06:46.740> here<00:06:46.979> it<00:06:47.069> is<00:06:47.189> and<00:06:48.199> now<00:06:49.729> this

00:06:51.079 --> 00:06:51.089 
see here it is and now this

00:06:51.089 --> 00:06:52.669 
see here it is and now this
I<00:06:51.119> made<00:06:51.389> ours<00:06:51.569> about<00:06:51.719> means<00:06:52.110> three<00:06:52.409> and<00:06:52.499> a<00:06:52.529> half

00:06:52.669 --> 00:06:52.679 
I made ours about means three and a half

00:06:52.679 --> 00:06:54.739 
I made ours about means three and a half
inches<00:06:53.009> thick<00:06:53.039> or<00:06:53.339> so<00:06:53.369> so<00:06:54.089> a<00:06:54.119> little<00:06:54.449> thing<00:06:54.629> I

00:06:54.739 --> 00:06:54.749 
inches thick or so so a little thing I

00:06:54.749 --> 00:06:56.419 
inches thick or so so a little thing I
decided<00:06:55.259> to<00:06:55.499> do<00:06:55.649> is<00:06:55.770> we're<00:06:55.949> just<00:06:55.979> going<00:06:56.129> to<00:06:56.279> do

00:06:56.419 --> 00:06:56.429 
decided to do is we're just going to do

00:06:56.429 --> 00:07:00.079 
decided to do is we're just going to do
one<00:06:56.669> more<00:06:56.849> layer<00:06:57.119> on<00:06:57.509> the<00:06:57.990> inside<00:06:58.349> edge<00:06:58.969> so<00:06:59.969> you

00:07:00.079 --> 00:07:00.089 
one more layer on the inside edge so you

00:07:00.089 --> 00:07:01.669 
one more layer on the inside edge so you
can<00:07:00.240> see<00:07:00.419> that<00:07:00.599> on<00:07:00.749> the<00:07:00.839> outside<00:07:00.990> I<00:07:01.229> kind<00:07:01.559> of

00:07:01.669 --> 00:07:01.679 
can see that on the outside I kind of

00:07:01.679 --> 00:07:06.829 
can see that on the outside I kind of
turned<00:07:03.139> the<00:07:04.139> little<00:07:04.589> tips<00:07:04.889> to<00:07:05.129> the<00:07:05.159> inside<00:07:05.839> and

00:07:06.829 --> 00:07:06.839 
turned the little tips to the inside and

00:07:06.839 --> 00:07:08.119 
turned the little tips to the inside and
I'm<00:07:06.959> going<00:07:07.169> to<00:07:07.199> do<00:07:07.349> that<00:07:07.499> again<00:07:07.800> I'm<00:07:07.949> going<00:07:08.069> to

00:07:08.119 --> 00:07:08.129 
I'm going to do that again I'm going to

00:07:08.129 --> 00:07:15.109 
I'm going to do that again I'm going to
take<00:07:08.399> my<00:07:08.639> next<00:07:08.969> paper<00:07:10.610> glue<00:07:11.610> gun<00:07:11.819> it<00:07:13.999> with<00:07:14.999> the

00:07:15.109 --> 00:07:15.119 
take my next paper glue gun it with the

00:07:15.119 --> 00:07:16.669 
take my next paper glue gun it with the
tip<00:07:15.389> turning<00:07:15.749> towards<00:07:16.020> the<00:07:16.139> inside<00:07:16.409> like<00:07:16.649> that

00:07:16.669 --> 00:07:16.679 
tip turning towards the inside like that

00:07:16.679 --> 00:07:18.439 
tip turning towards the inside like that
so<00:07:17.129> we're<00:07:17.279> going<00:07:17.369> to<00:07:17.459> continue<00:07:17.819> now<00:07:18.269> we're

00:07:18.439 --> 00:07:18.449 
so we're going to continue now we're

so we're going to continue now we're
going<00:07:18.539> to<00:07:18.599> glue<00:07:18.929> papers<00:07:19.919> all<00:07:20.069> along<00:07:20.550> the

00:07:20.929 --> 00:07:20.939 
going to glue papers all along the

00:07:20.939 --> 00:07:23.559 
going to glue papers all along the
inside<00:07:21.389> perimeter<00:07:21.839> of<00:07:21.869> our<00:07:22.169> heart

00:07:23.559 --> 00:07:23.569 
inside perimeter of our heart

00:07:23.569 --> 00:07:26.839 
inside perimeter of our heart
so<00:07:24.569> now<00:07:24.719> after<00:07:25.199> we've<00:07:25.349> glued<00:07:25.679> our<00:07:26.129> second
