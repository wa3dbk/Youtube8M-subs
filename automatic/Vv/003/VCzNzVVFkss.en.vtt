00:01:35.420 --> 00:01:35.430 
guess while playing I played like 10

00:01:35.430 --> 00:01:39.560 
guess while playing I played like 10
games<00:01:35.700> I've<00:01:36.090> hit<00:01:36.299> I<00:01:37.490> hit<00:01:38.490> two<00:01:38.729> shots<00:01:38.759> and

00:01:39.560 --> 00:01:39.570 
games I've hit I hit two shots and

00:01:39.570 --> 00:01:43.039 
games I've hit I hit two shots and
that's<00:01:39.960> mainly<00:01:40.290> because<00:01:41.780> everything<00:01:42.780> I<00:01:42.869> go

00:01:43.039 --> 00:01:43.049 
that's mainly because everything I go

00:01:43.049 --> 00:01:52.030 
that's mainly because everything I go
for<00:01:43.380> now<00:01:43.560> like<00:01:47.299> keep<00:01:48.299> messing<00:01:48.630> up<00:01:48.720> my<00:01:48.840> fingers

00:01:52.030 --> 00:01:52.040 

00:01:52.040 --> 00:01:56.030 

but<00:01:53.040> anyway<00:01:54.020> everything<00:01:55.020> I<00:01:55.110> go<00:01:55.320> for<00:01:55.560> now<00:01:55.770> is<00:01:56.009> a

00:01:56.030 --> 00:01:56.040 
but anyway everything I go for now is a

00:01:56.040 --> 00:01:58.340 
but anyway everything I go for now is a
lot<00:01:56.369> more<00:01:56.670> complex<00:01:57.479> than<00:01:57.719> at<00:01:57.990> least<00:01:58.170> it<00:01:58.320> used

00:01:58.340 --> 00:01:58.350 
lot more complex than at least it used

00:01:58.350 --> 00:02:04.440 
lot more complex than at least it used
to<00:01:58.770> be

00:02:04.440 --> 00:02:04.450 

00:02:04.450 --> 00:02:08.770
