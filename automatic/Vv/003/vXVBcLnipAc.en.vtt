00:00:04.590 --> 00:00:04.600 
so we use McEnroe growing potting mix

00:00:04.600 --> 00:00:06.450 
so we use McEnroe growing potting mix
that<00:00:04.870> we<00:00:04.990> get<00:00:05.170> from<00:00:05.200> a<00:00:05.470> McEnroe<00:00:05.860> organic<00:00:06.220> farm

00:00:06.450 --> 00:00:06.460 
that we get from a McEnroe organic farm

00:00:06.460 --> 00:00:08.970 
that we get from a McEnroe organic farm

the<00:00:09.249> best<00:00:09.370> one<00:00:09.610> we've<00:00:09.789> used<00:00:10.110> we<00:00:11.110> mix<00:00:11.320> it

00:00:11.400 --> 00:00:11.410 
the best one we've used we mix it

00:00:11.410 --> 00:00:13.650 
the best one we've used we mix it
together<00:00:11.559> with<00:00:12.309> some<00:00:12.519> of<00:00:12.639> the<00:00:12.730> farmer<00:00:13.240> d<00:00:13.389> soil

00:00:13.650 --> 00:00:13.660 
together with some of the farmer d soil

00:00:13.660 --> 00:00:16.560 
together with some of the farmer d soil
mix<00:00:13.869> that<00:00:14.019> we<00:00:14.139> buy<00:00:14.289> locally<00:00:15.119> we<00:00:16.119> see<00:00:16.330> a<00:00:16.359> lot<00:00:16.510> of

00:00:16.560 --> 00:00:16.570 
mix that we buy locally we see a lot of

00:00:16.570 --> 00:00:19.019 
mix that we buy locally we see a lot of
our<00:00:16.779> seats<00:00:17.679> by<00:00:17.859> hand<00:00:18.160> we<00:00:18.490> don't<00:00:18.609> do<00:00:18.760> that<00:00:18.910> many

00:00:19.019 --> 00:00:19.029 
our seats by hand we don't do that many

00:00:19.029 --> 00:00:21.450 
our seats by hand we don't do that many
flats<00:00:19.390> so<00:00:19.840> it's<00:00:20.349> enough<00:00:20.560> to<00:00:20.710> do<00:00:20.830> by<00:00:20.980> hand<00:00:21.189> we

00:00:21.450 --> 00:00:21.460 
flats so it's enough to do by hand we

00:00:21.460 --> 00:00:24.900 
flats so it's enough to do by hand we
use<00:00:21.609> it<00:00:21.789> also<00:00:22.060> a<00:00:22.090> very<00:00:22.949> thick<00:00:23.949> plastic<00:00:24.279> tray

the last forever the way we get the
seedlings<00:00:40.629> out<00:00:40.870> is<00:00:41.110> we<00:00:41.559> hit<00:00:41.680> decides<00:00:42.340> a<00:00:42.430> little

00:00:42.600 --> 00:00:42.610 
seedlings out is we hit decides a little

00:00:42.610 --> 00:00:43.950 
seedlings out is we hit decides a little
bit<00:00:42.699> with<00:00:42.820> the<00:00:42.910> hammer<00:00:43.090> that<00:00:43.360> loosens<00:00:43.780> up<00:00:43.899> the

00:00:43.950 --> 00:00:43.960 
bit with the hammer that loosens up the

00:00:43.960 --> 00:00:46.619 
bit with the hammer that loosens up the
root<00:00:44.230> root<00:00:44.649> balls<00:00:44.920> and<00:00:45.420> they're<00:00:46.420> much<00:00:46.600> easier

00:00:46.619 --> 00:00:46.629 
root root balls and they're much easier

00:00:46.629 --> 00:00:49.860 
root root balls and they're much easier
to<00:00:47.050> pull<00:00:47.440> out<00:00:47.649> of<00:00:47.829> those<00:00:48.390> out<00:00:49.390> of<00:00:49.420> the<00:00:49.600> tray<00:00:49.809> so

00:00:49.860 --> 00:00:49.870 
to pull out of those out of the tray so

00:00:49.870 --> 00:00:53.520 
to pull out of those out of the tray so
we<00:00:50.199> pull<00:00:50.379> those<00:00:50.559> out<00:00:51.840> as<00:00:52.840> you<00:00:53.019> can<00:00:53.170> see<00:00:53.350> it's

00:00:53.520 --> 00:00:53.530 
we pull those out as you can see it's

00:00:53.530 --> 00:00:54.869 
we pull those out as you can see it's
got<00:00:53.680> a<00:00:53.739> nice<00:00:53.859> little<00:00:54.070> root<00:00:54.280> ball<00:00:54.489> to<00:00:54.670> it<00:00:54.820> and

00:00:54.869 --> 00:00:54.879 
got a nice little root ball to it and

00:00:54.879 --> 00:00:57.959 
got a nice little root ball to it and
then<00:00:55.149> we<00:00:55.359> go<00:00:55.600> from<00:00:55.840> that<00:00:56.320> into<00:00:57.250> a<00:00:57.280> two-by-two

00:00:57.959 --> 00:00:57.969 
then we go from that into a two-by-two

00:00:57.969 --> 00:01:00.869 
then we go from that into a two-by-two
Jiffy<00:00:58.539> Pop<00:00:58.570> Jiffy<00:00:59.050> pots<00:01:00.010> are<00:01:00.309> made<00:01:00.489> from<00:01:00.699> a

00:01:00.869 --> 00:01:00.879 
Jiffy Pop Jiffy pots are made from a

00:01:00.879 --> 00:01:04.350 
Jiffy Pop Jiffy pots are made from a
lime<00:01:01.269> and<00:01:01.600> peat<00:01:01.840> moss<00:01:02.640> so<00:01:03.640> they're<00:01:03.879> easy<00:01:04.089> to

00:01:04.350 --> 00:01:04.360 
lime and peat moss so they're easy to

00:01:04.360 --> 00:01:07.170 
lime and peat moss so they're easy to
easy<00:01:04.689> to<00:01:04.930> plant<00:01:05.229> we<00:01:06.100> take<00:01:06.340> the<00:01:06.460> same<00:01:06.670> soil<00:01:06.880> mix

00:01:07.170 --> 00:01:07.180 
easy to plant we take the same soil mix

00:01:07.180 --> 00:01:10.260 
easy to plant we take the same soil mix
mcenroe<00:01:07.930> organic<00:01:08.830> farm<00:01:09.100> and<00:01:09.369> transplanted

00:01:10.260 --> 00:01:10.270 
mcenroe organic farm and transplanted

00:01:10.270 --> 00:01:13.649 
mcenroe organic farm and transplanted
transplanted<00:01:10.960> tomatoes<00:01:11.320> in<00:01:11.470> that<00:01:11.650> and<00:01:12.659> so

00:01:13.649 --> 00:01:13.659 
transplanted tomatoes in that and so

00:01:13.659 --> 00:01:16.350 
transplanted tomatoes in that and so
from<00:01:13.840> that<00:01:13.930> size<00:01:14.290> pot<00:01:14.890> we<00:01:15.340> plant<00:01:15.610> them<00:01:15.700> outside

00:01:16.350 --> 00:01:16.360 
from that size pot we plant them outside

00:01:16.360 --> 00:01:18.270 
from that size pot we plant them outside
so<00:01:16.780> this<00:01:16.930> is<00:01:17.079> basically<00:01:17.229> what<00:01:17.740> the<00:01:17.979> tomato

00:01:18.270 --> 00:01:18.280 
so this is basically what the tomato

00:01:18.280 --> 00:01:20.940 
so this is basically what the tomato
looks<00:01:18.490> like<00:01:18.759> when<00:01:19.030> we<00:01:19.530> planted<00:01:20.530> outside<00:01:20.680> this

00:01:20.940 --> 00:01:20.950 
looks like when we planted outside this

00:01:20.950 --> 00:01:22.920 
looks like when we planted outside this
is<00:01:21.070> also<00:01:21.310> how<00:01:21.490> we<00:01:21.610> sell<00:01:22.030> up<00:01:22.180> them<00:01:22.450> at<00:01:22.659> the

00:01:22.920 --> 00:01:22.930 
is also how we sell up them at the

00:01:22.930 --> 00:01:24.929 
is also how we sell up them at the
market<00:01:22.960> and<00:01:23.470> this<00:01:24.280> gives<00:01:24.460> you<00:01:24.610> a<00:01:24.640> little<00:01:24.820> idea

00:01:24.929 --> 00:01:24.939 
market and this gives you a little idea

00:01:24.939 --> 00:01:26.670 
market and this gives you a little idea
of<00:01:25.180> how<00:01:25.270> would<00:01:25.509> present<00:01:25.930> them<00:01:26.079> at<00:01:26.439> the<00:01:26.650> market

00:01:26.670 --> 00:01:26.680 
of how would present them at the market

00:01:26.680 --> 00:01:29.039 
of how would present them at the market
with<00:01:27.159> the<00:01:27.280> different<00:01:27.610> names<00:01:27.820> and<00:01:28.119> there<00:01:28.329> we

00:01:29.039 --> 00:01:29.049 
with the different names and there we

00:01:29.049 --> 00:01:32.310 
with the different names and there we
sell<00:01:29.259> mostly<00:01:30.180> heirloom<00:01:31.180> tomato<00:01:31.570> plants<00:01:32.110> at

sell mostly heirloom tomato plants at

00:01:32.320 --> 00:01:34.980 
sell mostly heirloom tomato plants at
market<00:01:32.770> because<00:01:33.640> those<00:01:34.030> are<00:01:34.210> harder<00:01:34.540> harder

our other transplants here we have China
choy<00:01:47.439> and<00:01:47.680> bok<00:01:47.979> choy<00:01:48.659> we<00:01:49.659> also<00:01:49.810> see<00:01:50.200> those<00:01:50.380> by

00:01:50.609 --> 00:01:50.619 
choy and bok choy we also see those by

00:01:50.619 --> 00:01:53.639 
choy and bok choy we also see those by
hand<00:01:51.180> we<00:01:52.180> do<00:01:52.329> have<00:01:52.509> a<00:01:52.540> vacuum<00:01:52.869> cedar<00:01:53.320> that<00:01:53.560> we
