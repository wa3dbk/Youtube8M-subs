everyone who want to see a video of this
guitar<00:00:06.660> I<00:00:07.200> just<00:00:08.069> got<00:00:08.280> the<00:00:08.700> think<00:00:09.599> it's<00:00:09.780> a<00:00:10.190> 89

00:00:11.180 --> 00:00:11.190 
guitar I just got the think it's a 89

00:00:11.190 --> 00:00:14.480 
guitar I just got the think it's a 89
not<00:00:11.910> sure<00:00:12.120> the<00:00:12.530> Kramer<00:00:13.530> sustainer<00:00:14.160> in

00:00:14.480 --> 00:00:14.490 
not sure the Kramer sustainer in

00:00:14.490 --> 00:00:17.810 
not sure the Kramer sustainer in
Hollywood<00:00:14.969> flash<00:00:15.859> yeah<00:00:16.859> 30<00:00:17.220> forever

00:00:17.810 --> 00:00:17.820 
Hollywood flash yeah 30 forever

00:00:17.820 --> 00:00:22.359 
Hollywood flash yeah 30 forever
-<00:00:18.359> thing<00:00:19.100> it<00:00:20.100> has<00:00:20.279> the<00:00:20.460> claw<00:00:20.880> inlay<00:00:21.449> neck<00:00:21.869> I

00:00:22.359 --> 00:00:22.369 
- thing it has the claw inlay neck I

00:00:22.369 --> 00:00:25.670 
- thing it has the claw inlay neck I
want<00:00:23.369> you<00:00:23.550> can<00:00:23.670> see<00:00:23.820> that<00:00:24.000> on<00:00:24.269> the<00:00:24.680> reverse

00:00:25.670 --> 00:00:25.680 
want you can see that on the reverse

00:00:25.680 --> 00:00:32.749 
want you can see that on the reverse
headstock<00:00:29.150> yeah<00:00:30.150> so<00:00:30.800> the<00:00:31.800> coolest<00:00:32.189> thing<00:00:32.430> I've

00:00:32.749 --> 00:00:32.759 
headstock yeah so the coolest thing I've

00:00:32.759 --> 00:00:37.250 
headstock yeah so the coolest thing I've
asked<00:00:33.180> our<00:00:33.360> obviously<00:00:34.350> is<00:00:34.590> a<00:00:34.620> sustainer<00:00:36.260> I'll

00:00:37.250 --> 00:00:37.260 
asked our obviously is a sustainer I'll

00:00:37.260 --> 00:00:42.110 
asked our obviously is a sustainer I'll
show<00:00:37.590> you<00:00:37.649> how<00:00:37.950> it<00:00:38.070> works<00:00:38.960> this<00:00:39.960> is<00:00:40.020> the<00:00:41.120> switch

00:00:42.110 --> 00:00:42.120 
show you how it works this is the switch

00:00:42.120 --> 00:00:44.569 
show you how it works this is the switch
that<00:00:42.149> turns<00:00:42.719> it<00:00:42.960> on<00:00:43.050> and<00:00:43.110> off<00:00:43.290> and<00:00:44.219> you<00:00:44.280> can<00:00:44.430> see

00:00:44.569 --> 00:00:44.579 
that turns it on and off and you can see

00:00:44.579 --> 00:00:47.110 
that turns it on and off and you can see
that<00:00:45.059> this<00:00:45.239> light<00:00:45.809> turns<00:00:45.989> green<00:00:46.170> lights<00:00:46.590> on

00:00:47.110 --> 00:00:47.120 
that this light turns green lights on

00:00:47.120 --> 00:00:49.400 
that this light turns green lights on
when<00:00:48.120> the<00:00:48.270> batteries<00:00:48.660> are<00:00:48.809> running<00:00:48.930> low<00:00:49.050> it

00:00:49.400 --> 00:00:49.410 
when the batteries are running low it

00:00:49.410 --> 00:00:53.569 
when the batteries are running low it
turns<00:00:49.620> red<00:00:49.950> which<00:00:50.370> is<00:00:50.399> pretty<00:00:50.730> cool<00:00:52.579> this

00:00:53.569 --> 00:00:53.579 
turns red which is pretty cool this

00:00:53.579 --> 00:00:56.779 
turns red which is pretty cool this
switch<00:00:54.090> is<00:00:54.539> for<00:00:55.440> the<00:00:55.590> three<00:00:55.890> sustainer<00:00:56.399> modes

00:00:56.779 --> 00:00:56.789 
switch is for the three sustainer modes

00:00:56.789 --> 00:00:59.540 
switch is for the three sustainer modes
and<00:00:57.199> the<00:00:58.199> all<00:00:58.379> the<00:00:58.410> way<00:00:58.590> down<00:00:58.770> position<00:00:58.980> is

00:00:59.540 --> 00:00:59.550 
and the all the way down position is

00:00:59.550 --> 00:01:03.139 
and the all the way down position is
harmonic<00:01:00.510> mid<00:01:00.899> with<00:01:01.020> intense<00:01:01.949> sensibility<00:01:02.820> or

00:01:03.139 --> 00:01:03.149 
harmonic mid with intense sensibility or

00:01:03.149 --> 00:01:05.210 
harmonic mid with intense sensibility or
something<00:01:03.510> like<00:01:03.629> that<00:01:03.690> the<00:01:04.650> middle<00:01:05.010> mid

00:01:05.210 --> 00:01:05.220 
something like that the middle mid

00:01:05.220 --> 00:01:08.500 
something like that the middle mid
digits<00:01:06.150> harmonic<00:01:06.600> mode<00:01:06.810> and<00:01:07.049> the<00:01:07.770> top

00:01:08.500 --> 00:01:08.510 
digits harmonic mode and the top

00:01:08.510 --> 00:01:11.960 
digits harmonic mode and the top
position<00:01:09.510> is<00:01:10.100> the<00:01:11.100> fundamental<00:01:11.670> mode<00:01:11.790> which

00:01:11.960 --> 00:01:11.970 
position is the fundamental mode which

00:01:11.970 --> 00:01:16.179 
position is the fundamental mode which
is<00:01:12.090> just<00:01:12.299> a<00:01:12.420> root<00:01:12.600> note<00:01:13.100> I'll<00:01:14.100> start<00:01:14.580> with

00:01:16.179 --> 00:01:16.189 
is just a root note I'll start with

00:01:16.189 --> 00:01:42.850 
is just a root note I'll start with
somehow<00:01:18.140> but<00:01:19.140> it<00:01:19.290> would<00:01:19.470> sound

00:01:42.850 --> 00:01:42.860 

00:01:42.860 --> 00:01:46.609 

this<00:01:43.860> goes<00:01:44.130> on<00:01:44.310> for<00:01:44.369> days<00:01:44.810> here<00:01:45.810> this<00:01:46.439> is

00:01:46.609 --> 00:01:46.619 
this goes on for days here this is

00:01:46.619 --> 00:02:03.729 
this goes on for days here this is
harmonic<00:01:47.100> mode<00:01:47.579> this<00:01:48.539> is<00:01:48.719> middle<00:01:48.929> position

00:02:03.729 --> 00:02:03.739 

00:02:03.739 --> 00:02:07.059 

it's<00:02:04.739> a<00:02:04.890> super<00:02:05.369> awesome<00:02:05.549> Vereen<00:02:06.060> or<00:02:06.209> ass<00:02:06.390> down

00:02:07.059 --> 00:02:07.069 
it's a super awesome Vereen or ass down

00:02:07.069 --> 00:02:10.400 
it's a super awesome Vereen or ass down
and<00:02:08.069> this<00:02:08.340> is<00:02:08.549> a<00:02:08.940> harmonic<00:02:09.780> mid<00:02:10.229> with

00:02:10.400 --> 00:02:10.410 
and this is a harmonic mid with

00:02:10.410 --> 00:02:36.289 
and this is a harmonic mid with
increased<00:02:11.780> sensibilities

00:02:36.289 --> 00:02:36.299 

00:02:36.299 --> 00:02:40.610 

that's<00:02:37.299> pretty<00:02:37.540> cool<00:02:37.900> um<00:02:38.609> now<00:02:39.609> it<00:02:39.939> is<00:02:40.090> this

00:02:40.610 --> 00:02:40.620 
that's pretty cool um now it is this

00:02:40.620 --> 00:02:44.069 
that's pretty cool um now it is this
cool<00:02:41.620> and<00:02:42.099> sustainable<00:02:42.819> but<00:02:43.090> it<00:02:43.389> sounds<00:02:43.810> great

00:02:44.069 --> 00:02:44.079 
cool and sustainable but it sounds great

00:02:44.079 --> 00:02:54.309 
cool and sustainable but it sounds great
as<00:02:44.379> a<00:02:44.769> neck<00:02:45.129> pickup<00:02:45.489> as<00:02:45.670> well

00:02:54.309 --> 00:02:54.319 

00:02:54.319 --> 00:03:04.760 

Oh

00:03:04.760 --> 00:03:04.770 

00:03:04.770 --> 00:03:08.760 

yes<00:03:05.770> Rico<00:03:06.250> in<00:03:06.430> the<00:03:06.640> middle<00:03:07.330> position<00:03:07.510> here<00:03:08.440> and

00:03:08.760 --> 00:03:08.770 
yes Rico in the middle position here and

00:03:08.770 --> 00:03:11.699 
yes Rico in the middle position here and
take<00:03:09.010> off<00:03:09.160> selectively<00:03:09.610> switch<00:03:09.850> is<00:03:10.060> a<00:03:10.709> thing

00:03:11.699 --> 00:03:11.709 
take off selectively switch is a thing

00:03:11.709 --> 00:03:13.860 
take off selectively switch is a thing
to<00:03:11.920> mix<00:03:12.069> between<00:03:12.280> the<00:03:12.459> two<00:03:12.550> that<00:03:13.540> sounds

00:03:13.860 --> 00:03:13.870 
to mix between the two that sounds

00:03:13.870 --> 00:03:20.650 
to mix between the two that sounds
pretty<00:03:14.020> cool

00:03:20.650 --> 00:03:20.660 

00:03:20.660 --> 00:03:31.630 

Oh

00:03:31.630 --> 00:03:31.640 

00:03:31.640 --> 00:03:35.559 

yeah<00:03:32.640> that's<00:03:33.030> uh<00:03:33.180> pretty<00:03:34.140> much<00:03:34.230> the<00:03:34.590> guitar

00:03:35.559 --> 00:03:35.569 
yeah that's uh pretty much the guitar

00:03:35.569 --> 00:03:38.300 
yeah that's uh pretty much the guitar
actions<00:03:36.569> really<00:03:36.719> loving<00:03:37.170> this<00:03:37.290> is<00:03:37.500> Li<00:03:37.739> Zi<00:03:37.799> play

00:03:38.300 --> 00:03:38.310
