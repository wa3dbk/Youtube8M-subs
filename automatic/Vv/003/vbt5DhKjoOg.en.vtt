00:01:30.260 --> 00:01:30.270 
to me that a is definitely the way

00:01:55.070 --> 00:01:55.080 
choose blood tap because that just seems

00:01:55.080 --> 00:01:56.719 
choose blood tap because that just seems
to<00:01:55.289> be<00:01:55.319> the<00:01:55.500> most<00:01:55.679> stable<00:01:55.890> for<00:01:56.310> getting<00:01:56.580> the

screw ground seems to be best

00:02:03.060 --> 00:02:05.180 
screw ground seems to be best
I<00:02:03.090> mean<00:02:03.300> it's<00:02:03.599> another<00:02:03.869> trinket<00:02:04.410> why<00:02:04.679> not<00:02:04.920> you

I mean it's another trinket why not you

00:02:05.190 --> 00:02:07.339 
I mean it's another trinket why not you
know<00:02:05.220> okay<00:02:06.149> thanks<00:02:06.509> for<00:02:06.569> watching<00:02:06.899> this<00:02:07.110> part

know okay thanks for watching this part

00:02:07.349 --> 00:02:17.350 
know okay thanks for watching this part
and<00:02:07.560> let's<00:02:08.039> jump<00:02:08.310> right<00:02:08.520> into<00:02:08.910> the

00:02:17.350 --> 00:02:17.360 

00:02:17.360 --> 00:02:19.180 

all<00:02:17.870> right<00:02:18.020> guys<00:02:18.170> let's<00:02:18.620> look<00:02:18.800> at<00:02:18.890> the<00:02:18.980> macro

00:02:19.180 --> 00:02:19.190 
all right guys let's look at the macro

00:02:19.190 --> 00:02:21.820 
all right guys let's look at the macro
so<00:02:19.700> I<00:02:20.000> have<00:02:20.480> two<00:02:20.840> different<00:02:20.960> macros<00:02:21.530> for

00:02:21.820 --> 00:02:21.830 
so I have two different macros for

00:02:21.830 --> 00:02:23.380 
so I have two different macros for
switching<00:02:22.190> through<00:02:22.490> unholy<00:02:22.970> and<00:02:23.180> blood

00:02:23.380 --> 00:02:23.390 
switching through unholy and blood

00:02:23.390 --> 00:02:25.120 
switching through unholy and blood
presence<00:02:23.840> you<00:02:24.020> can<00:02:24.050> keep<00:02:24.380> on<00:02:24.530> the<00:02:24.560> stances<00:02:25.100> but

00:02:25.120 --> 00:02:25.130 
presence you can keep on the stances but

00:02:25.130 --> 00:02:27.070 
presence you can keep on the stances but
for<00:02:25.550> the<00:02:25.640> sake<00:02:25.820> of<00:02:25.850> my<00:02:26.120> other<00:02:26.300> characters<00:02:26.870> I

00:02:27.070 --> 00:02:27.080 
for the sake of my other characters I

00:02:27.080 --> 00:02:29.410 
for the sake of my other characters I
choose<00:02:27.560> to<00:02:27.710> make<00:02:27.830> these<00:02:28.010> macros<00:02:28.490> just<00:02:28.880> so<00:02:29.060> it

00:02:29.410 --> 00:02:29.420 
choose to make these macros just so it

00:02:29.420 --> 00:02:31.000 
choose to make these macros just so it
sticks<00:02:29.870> still<00:02:30.140> my<00:02:30.320> traditional<00:02:30.830> way<00:02:30.980> of

sticks still my traditional way of

00:02:31.010 --> 00:02:32.830 
sticks still my traditional way of

00:02:55.900 --> 00:02:55.910 
stone if I'm playing with a warlock so

00:02:55.910 --> 00:02:57.699 
stone if I'm playing with a warlock so
that's<00:02:56.060> really<00:02:56.360> good<00:02:56.570> because<00:02:56.840> they're

00:02:57.699 --> 00:02:57.709 
that's really good because they're

00:02:57.709 --> 00:02:59.410 
that's really good because they're
around<00:02:57.980> the<00:02:58.130> same<00:02:58.340> cooldown<00:02:58.760> and<00:02:59.060> you<00:02:59.270> can

00:02:59.410 --> 00:02:59.420 
around the same cooldown and you can

00:02:59.420 --> 00:03:00.730 
around the same cooldown and you can
just<00:02:59.570> get<00:02:59.660> the<00:02:59.780> optimal<00:03:00.200> healing<00:03:00.380> if<00:03:00.650> you

00:03:00.730 --> 00:03:00.740 
just get the optimal healing if you

00:03:00.740 --> 00:03:02.410 
just get the optimal healing if you
forget<00:03:01.040> about<00:03:01.100> how<00:03:01.370> so<00:03:01.640> it<00:03:01.820> don't<00:03:02.000> have<00:03:02.150> an<00:03:02.270> e

00:03:02.410 --> 00:03:02.420 
forget about how so it don't have an e

00:03:02.420 --> 00:03:05.050 
forget about how so it don't have an e

and<00:03:05.330> this<00:03:05.900> is<00:03:06.080> really<00:03:06.320> good<00:03:06.500> because<00:03:06.709> you'd

00:03:07.510 --> 00:03:07.520 
and this is really good because you'd

00:03:07.520 --> 00:03:09.670 
and this is really good because you'd
have<00:03:07.550> to<00:03:07.700> ki<00:03:08.000> bind<00:03:08.240> all<00:03:08.540> these<00:03:08.900> Pat<00:03:09.140> abilities

00:03:09.670 --> 00:03:09.680 
have to ki bind all these Pat abilities

00:03:09.680 --> 00:03:12.970 
have to ki bind all these Pat abilities
on<00:03:09.920> on<00:03:10.850> the<00:03:11.150> pet<00:03:11.360> bar<00:03:11.690> because<00:03:12.410> somebody's<00:03:12.890> you

00:03:12.970 --> 00:03:12.980 
on on the pet bar because somebody's you

00:03:12.980 --> 00:03:15.400 
on on the pet bar because somebody's you
can't<00:03:13.190> drag<00:03:13.430> them<00:03:13.580> down<00:03:13.610> here<00:03:14.000> so<00:03:14.480> if<00:03:14.990> I<00:03:15.170> I

00:03:15.400 --> 00:03:15.410 
can't drag them down here so if I I

00:03:15.410 --> 00:03:17.530 
can't drag them down here so if I I
found<00:03:15.800> the<00:03:15.950> most<00:03:16.130> conventional<00:03:16.459> way<00:03:16.910> is<00:03:17.180> to

00:03:17.530 --> 00:03:17.540 
found the most conventional way is to

00:03:17.540 --> 00:03:21.040 
found the most conventional way is to
just<00:03:17.900> make<00:03:18.230> a<00:03:18.500> macro<00:03:18.940> so<00:03:19.940> this<00:03:20.390> is<00:03:20.540> my<00:03:20.720> gold

00:03:21.040 --> 00:03:21.050 
just make a macro so this is my gold

00:03:21.050 --> 00:03:23.080 
just make a macro so this is my gold
leaf<00:03:21.320> which<00:03:21.890> is<00:03:22.100> in<00:03:22.280> the<00:03:22.400> same<00:03:22.550> boat<00:03:22.790> with<00:03:22.820> the

00:03:23.080 --> 00:03:23.090 
leaf which is in the same boat with the

00:03:23.090 --> 00:03:25.570 
leaf which is in the same boat with the
knob<00:03:23.300> and<00:03:23.630> then<00:03:24.260> I<00:03:24.470> have<00:03:24.590> a<00:03:24.620> macro<00:03:24.890> to<00:03:25.070> target

00:03:25.570 --> 00:03:25.580 
knob and then I have a macro to target

00:03:25.580 --> 00:03:28.509 
knob and then I have a macro to target
myself<00:03:26.060> so<00:03:26.810> when<00:03:27.080> I<00:03:27.110> popped<00:03:27.440> Lich<00:03:27.769> born<00:03:28.070> I<00:03:28.310> can

00:03:28.509 --> 00:03:28.519 
myself so when I popped Lich born I can

00:03:28.519 --> 00:03:30.610 
myself so when I popped Lich born I can
actually<00:03:28.730> toss<00:03:29.209> that<00:03:29.480> close<00:03:29.810> to<00:03:30.050> myself<00:03:30.200> and

00:03:30.610 --> 00:03:30.620 
actually toss that close to myself and

00:03:30.620 --> 00:03:33.370 
actually toss that close to myself and
that<00:03:31.580> I<00:03:31.910> found<00:03:32.150> that's<00:03:32.390> my<00:03:32.570> most<00:03:32.780> efficient

00:03:33.370 --> 00:03:33.380 
that I found that's my most efficient

00:03:33.380 --> 00:03:35.890 
that I found that's my most efficient
way<00:03:33.590> to<00:03:33.650> all<00:03:34.160> the<00:03:34.850> target<00:03:35.180> myself<00:03:35.510> and<00:03:35.810> just

00:03:35.890 --> 00:03:35.900 
way to all the target myself and just

00:03:35.900 --> 00:03:38.080 
way to all the target myself and just
heal<00:03:36.140> through<00:03:36.410> much<00:03:36.590> more<00:03:36.670> then<00:03:37.670> this<00:03:37.880> is<00:03:38.060> a

00:03:38.080 --> 00:03:38.090 
heal through much more then this is a

00:03:38.090 --> 00:03:40.270 
heal through much more then this is a
focus<00:03:38.480> kick<00:03:38.959> which<00:03:39.230> I<00:03:39.470> can't<00:03:39.769> stress<00:03:40.100> enough

00:03:40.270 --> 00:03:40.280 
focus kick which I can't stress enough

00:03:40.280 --> 00:03:43.840 
focus kick which I can't stress enough
this<00:03:40.670> is<00:03:40.910> a<00:03:41.150> very<00:03:42.019> very<00:03:42.320> very<00:03:42.650> strong<00:03:43.010> macro<00:03:43.459> if

00:03:43.840 --> 00:03:43.850 
this is a very very very strong macro if

00:03:46.390 --> 00:03:46.400 
everything is all clustered up and

00:03:46.400 --> 00:03:48.699 
everything is all clustered up and
there's<00:03:47.269> a<00:03:47.360> healer<00:03:47.750> casting<00:03:48.140> a<00:03:48.200> spell<00:03:48.320> while

00:03:50.500 --> 00:03:50.510 
you're on a DPS you can just slightly

00:03:50.510 --> 00:03:52.150 
you're on a DPS you can just slightly
turn<00:03:50.780> your<00:03:50.959> character<00:03:51.080> press<00:03:51.590> that<00:03:51.800> button

00:03:53.339 --> 00:03:53.349 
and it's a

00:03:53.349 --> 00:03:55.290 
and it's a
so<00:03:53.650> I<00:03:53.680> really<00:03:54.310> can't<00:03:54.340> stress<00:03:54.790> this<00:03:54.940> macro

00:03:55.290 --> 00:03:55.300 
so I really can't stress this macro

00:03:55.300 --> 00:03:57.869 
so I really can't stress this macro
enough<00:03:55.510> it's<00:03:55.810> really<00:03:56.260> simple<00:03:56.739> and<00:03:56.950> I<00:03:57.550> think

00:03:57.869 --> 00:03:57.879 
enough it's really simple and I think

00:03:57.879 --> 00:03:59.550 
enough it's really simple and I think
more<00:03:58.450> people<00:03:58.510> should<00:03:58.810> be<00:03:59.019> taking<00:03:59.349> advantage

00:03:59.550 --> 00:03:59.560 
more people should be taking advantage
