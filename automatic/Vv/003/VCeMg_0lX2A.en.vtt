00:00:00.170 --> 00:00:03.200 

okay<00:00:01.170> I'm<00:00:01.439> gonna<00:00:01.560> look<00:00:02.129> at<00:00:02.310> some<00:00:02.340> number

00:00:03.200 --> 00:00:03.210 
okay I'm gonna look at some number

00:00:03.210 --> 00:00:07.130 
okay I'm gonna look at some number
patterns<00:00:04.670> sometimes<00:00:05.670> you<00:00:06.390> have<00:00:06.540> really<00:00:06.899> easy

00:00:07.130 --> 00:00:07.140 
patterns sometimes you have really easy

00:00:07.140 --> 00:00:08.900 
patterns sometimes you have really easy
patterns<00:00:07.649> like<00:00:07.770> this<00:00:07.950> first<00:00:08.309> one<00:00:08.519> and<00:00:08.760> it's

00:00:08.900 --> 00:00:08.910 
patterns like this first one and it's

00:00:08.910 --> 00:00:12.560 
patterns like this first one and it's
just<00:00:09.120> an<00:00:09.300> addition<00:00:10.820> pattern<00:00:11.820> and<00:00:12.059> I<00:00:12.150> can<00:00:12.360> see

00:00:12.560 --> 00:00:12.570 
just an addition pattern and I can see

00:00:12.570 --> 00:00:16.670 
just an addition pattern and I can see
that<00:00:12.750> from<00:00:12.900> 8<00:00:13.230> to<00:00:13.380> 12<00:00:13.559> is<00:00:13.920> plus<00:00:14.250> 4<00:00:14.990> from<00:00:15.990> 12<00:00:16.410> to

00:00:16.670 --> 00:00:16.680 
that from 8 to 12 is plus 4 from 12 to

00:00:16.680 --> 00:00:22.880 
that from 8 to 12 is plus 4 from 12 to
16<00:00:17.070> is<00:00:17.609> plus<00:00:17.940> 4<00:00:18.710> from<00:00:19.710> 16<00:00:20.220> to<00:00:20.400> 20<00:00:21.000> s<00:00:21.180> plus<00:00:21.660> 4<00:00:22.050> so

00:00:22.880 --> 00:00:22.890 
16 is plus 4 from 16 to 20 s plus 4 so

00:00:22.890 --> 00:00:28.339 
16 is plus 4 from 16 to 20 s plus 4 so
then<00:00:23.130> plus<00:00:23.820> 4<00:00:24.210> here<00:00:24.779> would<00:00:25.590> give<00:00:25.769> me<00:00:25.949> 24<00:00:26.960> plus<00:00:27.960> 4

00:00:28.339 --> 00:00:28.349 
then plus 4 here would give me 24 plus 4

00:00:28.349 --> 00:00:33.020 
then plus 4 here would give me 24 plus 4
more<00:00:28.740> would<00:00:29.730> give<00:00:29.939> me<00:00:30.060> 28<00:00:31.219> but<00:00:32.219> sometimes<00:00:32.640> it's

00:00:33.020 --> 00:00:33.030 
more would give me 28 but sometimes it's

00:00:33.030 --> 00:00:36.860 
more would give me 28 but sometimes it's
not<00:00:33.360> that<00:00:33.750> easy<00:00:34.100> so<00:00:35.100> look<00:00:35.250> at<00:00:35.399> this<00:00:35.610> one<00:00:35.820> from<00:00:36.180> 3

00:00:36.860 --> 00:00:36.870 
not that easy so look at this one from 3

00:00:36.870 --> 00:00:42.860 
not that easy so look at this one from 3
to<00:00:37.170> 9<00:00:37.440> is<00:00:37.739> plus<00:00:38.010> 6<00:00:38.719> from<00:00:39.719> nine<00:00:40.110> to<00:00:40.649> 27<00:00:41.450> this<00:00:42.450> plus

00:00:42.860 --> 00:00:42.870 
to 9 is plus 6 from nine to 27 this plus

00:00:42.870 --> 00:00:48.350 
to 9 is plus 6 from nine to 27 this plus
18<00:00:43.559> and<00:00:44.040> let's<00:00:44.789> see<00:00:45.090> from<00:00:45.350> 27<00:00:46.350> to<00:00:46.640> 81<00:00:47.640> see

00:00:48.350 --> 00:00:48.360 
18 and let's see from 27 to 81 see

00:00:48.360 --> 00:00:57.830 
18 and let's see from 27 to 81 see
that's<00:00:48.600> 81<00:00:49.309> minus<00:00:50.600> 27<00:00:55.789> 54<00:00:56.789> and<00:00:57.030> I'm<00:00:57.239> not<00:00:57.480> seeing

00:00:57.830 --> 00:00:57.840 
that's 81 minus 27 54 and I'm not seeing

00:00:57.840 --> 00:01:01.160 
that's 81 minus 27 54 and I'm not seeing
the<00:00:57.989> pattern<00:00:58.469> in<00:00:58.620> the<00:00:58.739> addition<00:00:59.359> so<00:01:00.359> what<00:01:01.140> I

00:01:01.160 --> 00:01:01.170 
the pattern in the addition so what I

00:01:01.170 --> 00:01:02.869 
the pattern in the addition so what I
can<00:01:01.320> do<00:01:01.739> is<00:01:01.890> see<00:01:02.129> if<00:01:02.160> it's<00:01:02.399> a<00:01:02.520> multiplication

00:01:02.869 --> 00:01:02.879 
can do is see if it's a multiplication

00:01:02.879 --> 00:01:05.810 
can do is see if it's a multiplication
pattern<00:01:03.690> so<00:01:04.350> I<00:01:04.379> look<00:01:04.650> down<00:01:04.890> here<00:01:05.129> and<00:01:05.280> I<00:01:05.339> say<00:01:05.549> ok

00:01:05.810 --> 00:01:05.820 
pattern so I look down here and I say ok

00:01:05.820 --> 00:01:10.520 
pattern so I look down here and I say ok
what<00:01:06.150> times<00:01:06.450> 3<00:01:06.780> gives<00:01:06.960> me<00:01:07.320> 9<00:01:07.619> its<00:01:08.220> times<00:01:08.640> 3<00:01:09.470> yeah

00:01:10.520 --> 00:01:10.530 
what times 3 gives me 9 its times 3 yeah

00:01:10.530 --> 00:01:15.320 
what times 3 gives me 9 its times 3 yeah
what<00:01:11.310> times<00:01:11.610> 9<00:01:11.850> gives<00:01:12.150> me<00:01:12.270> 27<00:01:13.140> times<00:01:13.250> 3<00:01:14.250> and<00:01:15.090> I'm

00:01:15.320 --> 00:01:15.330 
what times 9 gives me 27 times 3 and I'm

00:01:15.330 --> 00:01:17.480 
what times 9 gives me 27 times 3 and I'm
thinking<00:01:15.810> this<00:01:15.960> is<00:01:16.020> going<00:01:16.290> to<00:01:16.380> be<00:01:16.560> times<00:01:16.920> 3<00:01:17.280> 2

00:01:17.480 --> 00:01:17.490 
thinking this is going to be times 3 2

00:01:17.490 --> 00:01:23.240 
thinking this is going to be times 3 2
but<00:01:17.700> let<00:01:17.850> me<00:01:17.939> just<00:01:18.150> check<00:01:19.189> 27<00:01:20.189> times<00:01:21.090> 3<00:01:22.130> 3<00:01:23.130> times

00:01:23.240 --> 00:01:23.250 
but let me just check 27 times 3 3 times

00:01:23.250 --> 00:01:29.179 
but let me just check 27 times 3 3 times
7<00:01:24.030> is<00:01:24.270> 21<00:01:25.250> 3<00:01:26.250> times<00:01:26.580> 2<00:01:26.970> is<00:01:27.000> 6<00:01:27.090> plus<00:01:27.630> 2<00:01:28.049> is<00:01:28.080> 81<00:01:28.829> yes

00:01:29.179 --> 00:01:29.189 
7 is 21 3 times 2 is 6 plus 2 is 81 yes

00:01:29.189 --> 00:01:32.359 
7 is 21 3 times 2 is 6 plus 2 is 81 yes
this<00:01:30.090> is<00:01:30.270> times<00:01:30.509> 3<00:01:30.869> so<00:01:31.590> then<00:01:31.799> I<00:01:31.829> just<00:01:31.920> need<00:01:32.250> to

00:01:32.359 --> 00:01:32.369 
this is times 3 so then I just need to

00:01:32.369 --> 00:01:36.940 
this is times 3 so then I just need to
do<00:01:32.520> 81<00:01:33.420> times<00:01:33.840> three<00:01:34.409> just<00:01:35.369> three<00:01:35.549> twenty<00:01:36.450> four

00:01:36.940 --> 00:01:36.950 
do 81 times three just three twenty four

00:01:36.950 --> 00:01:39.380 
do 81 times three just three twenty four
to<00:01:38.270> three

00:01:39.380 --> 00:01:39.390 
to three

00:01:39.390 --> 00:01:44.620 
to three
and<00:01:39.630> then<00:01:40.290> that<00:01:40.650> times<00:01:41.159> three<00:01:41.930> nine<00:01:43.340> twelve

00:01:44.620 --> 00:01:44.630 
and then that times three nine twelve

00:01:44.630 --> 00:01:48.149 
and then that times three nine twelve
six<00:01:45.630> seven<00:01:46.409> seven

00:01:48.149 --> 00:01:48.159 
six seven seven

00:01:48.159 --> 00:01:50.950 
six seven seven
now<00:01:49.159> this<00:01:49.310> next<00:01:49.549> what<00:01:49.880> these<00:01:50.030> fractions<00:01:50.719> looks

00:01:50.950 --> 00:01:50.960 
now this next what these fractions looks

00:01:50.960 --> 00:01:53.289 
now this next what these fractions looks
horrendous<00:01:51.609> now<00:01:52.609> I'm<00:01:52.700> not<00:01:52.850> sure<00:01:52.880> what's

00:01:53.289 --> 00:01:53.299 
horrendous now I'm not sure what's

00:01:53.299 --> 00:01:57.010 
horrendous now I'm not sure what's
happening<00:01:53.899> there<00:01:54.170> at<00:01:54.350> all<00:01:54.759> so<00:01:55.759> I<00:01:56.539> need<00:01:56.840> to

00:01:57.010 --> 00:01:57.020 
happening there at all so I need to

00:01:57.020 --> 00:02:00.929 
happening there at all so I need to
decide<00:01:57.409> how<00:01:57.710> to<00:01:57.770> deal<00:01:58.189> with<00:01:59.140> with<00:02:00.140> the

00:02:00.929 --> 00:02:00.939 
decide how to deal with with the

00:02:00.939 --> 00:02:03.850 
decide how to deal with with the
fractions<00:02:01.939> well<00:02:02.270> one<00:02:02.509> thing<00:02:02.780> you<00:02:02.810> can<00:02:03.170> do<00:02:03.500> if

00:02:03.850 --> 00:02:03.860 
fractions well one thing you can do if

00:02:03.860 --> 00:02:06.609 
fractions well one thing you can do if
you<00:02:04.340> have<00:02:04.369> a<00:02:04.579> hard<00:02:04.880> time<00:02:05.119> you<00:02:05.479> know<00:02:05.780> trying<00:02:06.530> to

00:02:06.609 --> 00:02:06.619 
you have a hard time you know trying to

00:02:06.619 --> 00:02:09.100 
you have a hard time you know trying to
add<00:02:06.799> fractions<00:02:07.310> all<00:02:07.819> the<00:02:07.939> time<00:02:08.179> is<00:02:08.660> you<00:02:08.869> can

00:02:09.100 --> 00:02:09.110 
add fractions all the time is you can

00:02:09.110 --> 00:02:11.350 
add fractions all the time is you can
think<00:02:09.319> about<00:02:09.500> it<00:02:09.830> in<00:02:09.979> terms<00:02:10.190> of<00:02:10.399> money<00:02:10.729> because

00:02:11.350 --> 00:02:11.360 
think about it in terms of money because

00:02:11.360 --> 00:02:13.229 
think about it in terms of money because
we<00:02:11.540> have<00:02:11.629> a<00:02:11.660> lot<00:02:11.900> more<00:02:11.930> experience<00:02:12.799> in<00:02:12.980> money

00:02:13.229 --> 00:02:13.239 
we have a lot more experience in money

00:02:13.239 --> 00:02:15.880 
we have a lot more experience in money
okay<00:02:14.239> so<00:02:14.299> if<00:02:14.629> I<00:02:14.720> think<00:02:14.780> about<00:02:15.200> this<00:02:15.410> is<00:02:15.620> six

00:02:15.880 --> 00:02:15.890 
okay so if I think about this is six

00:02:15.890 --> 00:02:19.979 
okay so if I think about this is six
dollars<00:02:16.160> and<00:02:16.849> then<00:02:17.560> 3/4<00:02:18.560> of<00:02:18.680> a<00:02:18.799> dollar

00:02:19.979 --> 00:02:19.989 
dollars and then 3/4 of a dollar

00:02:19.989 --> 00:02:22.509 
dollars and then 3/4 of a dollar
three<00:02:20.989> out<00:02:21.140> of<00:02:21.170> four<00:02:21.500> of<00:02:21.739> something<00:02:21.980> that's

00:02:22.509 --> 00:02:22.519 
three out of four of something that's

00:02:22.519 --> 00:02:24.759 
three out of four of something that's
quarters<00:02:23.209> three<00:02:23.660> quarters<00:02:24.079> would<00:02:24.319> be<00:02:24.410> seventy

00:02:24.759 --> 00:02:24.769 
quarters three quarters would be seventy

00:02:24.769 --> 00:02:28.870 
quarters three quarters would be seventy
five<00:02:24.920> cents<00:02:25.250> so<00:02:25.519> this<00:02:26.030> would<00:02:26.180> be<00:02:27.400> $6.75<00:02:28.400> and

00:02:28.870 --> 00:02:28.880 
five cents so this would be $6.75 and

00:02:28.880 --> 00:02:31.949 
five cents so this would be $6.75 and
then<00:02:29.660> this<00:02:29.870> one<00:02:30.079> would<00:02:30.230> be<00:02:30.440> seven<00:02:30.980> half<00:02:31.310> of

00:02:31.949 --> 00:02:31.959 
then this one would be seven half of

00:02:31.959 --> 00:02:37.000 
then this one would be seven half of
$1.50<00:02:32.959> and<00:02:34.480> 1/4<00:02:35.480> of<00:02:35.780> a<00:02:35.870> dollar<00:02:35.900> the<00:02:36.530> quarters

00:02:37.000 --> 00:02:37.010 
$1.50 and 1/4 of a dollar the quarters

00:02:37.010 --> 00:02:41.920 
$1.50 and 1/4 of a dollar the quarters
again<00:02:37.370> is<00:02:37.780> 825<00:02:39.579> so<00:02:40.579> now<00:02:40.819> as<00:02:41.239> I<00:02:41.390> look<00:02:41.599> at<00:02:41.720> this

00:02:41.920 --> 00:02:41.930 
again is 825 so now as I look at this

00:02:41.930 --> 00:02:47.740 
again is 825 so now as I look at this
this<00:02:42.470> is<00:02:42.739> going<00:02:43.400> up<00:02:43.579> by<00:02:44.739> 75<00:02:45.739> cents<00:02:46.510> and<00:02:47.510> then

00:02:47.740 --> 00:02:47.750 
this is going up by 75 cents and then

00:02:47.750 --> 00:02:53.170 
this is going up by 75 cents and then
from<00:02:48.200> 675<00:02:49.069> to<00:02:49.510> 750<00:02:50.510> is<00:02:51.110> also<00:02:51.620> going<00:02:51.799> up<00:02:52.040> by<00:02:52.489> 75

00:02:53.170 --> 00:02:53.180 
from 675 to 750 is also going up by 75

00:02:53.180 --> 00:02:58.240 
from 675 to 750 is also going up by 75
cents<00:02:53.810> and<00:02:54.370> then<00:02:55.370> from<00:02:55.760> 750<00:02:56.540> to<00:02:56.780> 825<00:02:57.590> it's<00:02:57.920> also

00:02:58.240 --> 00:02:58.250 
cents and then from 750 to 825 it's also

00:02:58.250 --> 00:03:01.870 
cents and then from 750 to 825 it's also
going<00:02:58.700> up<00:02:58.850> by<00:02:59.060> 75<00:02:59.750> cents<00:03:00.260> so<00:03:01.160> if<00:03:01.310> I<00:03:01.430> went<00:03:01.579> up<00:03:01.760> by

00:03:01.870 --> 00:03:01.880 
going up by 75 cents so if I went up by

00:03:01.880 --> 00:03:04.809 
going up by 75 cents so if I went up by
75<00:03:02.450> cents<00:03:02.840> here<00:03:03.260> it<00:03:03.440> would<00:03:03.650> be<00:03:03.680> nine<00:03:04.190> dollars

00:03:04.809 --> 00:03:04.819 
75 cents here it would be nine dollars

00:03:04.819 --> 00:03:08.890 
75 cents here it would be nine dollars
and<00:03:05.180> then<00:03:06.160> 975<00:03:07.160> then<00:03:08.090> I<00:03:08.120> see<00:03:08.180> to<00:03:08.450> translate

00:03:08.890 --> 00:03:08.900 
and then 975 then I see to translate

00:03:08.900 --> 00:03:10.809 
and then 975 then I see to translate
these<00:03:09.079> back<00:03:09.410> into<00:03:09.739> regular<00:03:10.069> numbers<00:03:10.489> that

00:03:10.809 --> 00:03:10.819 
these back into regular numbers that

00:03:10.819 --> 00:03:13.839 
these back into regular numbers that
would<00:03:10.940> of<00:03:11.030> course<00:03:11.090> just<00:03:11.450> be<00:03:11.599> nine<00:03:11.870> and<00:03:12.849> three

00:03:13.839 --> 00:03:13.849 
would of course just be nine and three

00:03:13.849 --> 00:03:16.000 
would of course just be nine and three
quarters<00:03:13.880> out<00:03:14.630> of<00:03:14.690> four<00:03:15.079> quarters<00:03:15.620> would<00:03:15.859> be

00:03:16.000 --> 00:03:16.010 
quarters out of four quarters would be

00:03:16.010 --> 00:03:18.940 
quarters out of four quarters would be
three<00:03:16.310> fourths<00:03:16.819> so<00:03:17.569> that's<00:03:17.810> nine<00:03:18.169> and<00:03:18.560> three

00:03:18.940 --> 00:03:18.950 
three fourths so that's nine and three

00:03:18.950 --> 00:03:22.030 
three fourths so that's nine and three
fourths<00:03:19.549> so<00:03:20.540> sometimes<00:03:21.230> you<00:03:21.290> gotta<00:03:21.440> look<00:03:21.859> at

00:03:22.030 --> 00:03:22.040 
fourths so sometimes you gotta look at

00:03:22.040 --> 00:03:24.970 
fourths so sometimes you gotta look at
some<00:03:22.510> tricks<00:03:23.510> to<00:03:23.810> try<00:03:23.989> to<00:03:24.049> figure<00:03:24.410> it<00:03:24.560> out<00:03:24.709> but

00:03:24.970 --> 00:03:24.980 
some tricks to try to figure it out but

00:03:24.980 --> 00:03:27.490 
some tricks to try to figure it out but
don't<00:03:25.519> always<00:03:25.639> think<00:03:25.730> it's<00:03:26.090> addition<00:03:26.750> it<00:03:27.260> can

00:03:27.490 --> 00:03:27.500 
don't always think it's addition it can

00:03:27.500 --> 00:03:29.170 
don't always think it's addition it can
be<00:03:27.680> anything<00:03:28.069> it<00:03:28.430> could<00:03:28.549> be<00:03:28.609> a<00:03:28.730> multiplication

00:03:29.170 --> 00:03:29.180 
be anything it could be a multiplication

00:03:29.180 --> 00:03:31.210 
be anything it could be a multiplication
problem<00:03:29.720> it<00:03:30.139> could<00:03:30.260> be<00:03:30.380> a<00:03:30.410> division<00:03:31.190> problem

00:03:31.210 --> 00:03:31.220 
problem it could be a division problem

00:03:31.220 --> 00:03:34.360 
problem it could be a division problem
it<00:03:31.849> could<00:03:31.940> be<00:03:32.090> a<00:03:32.139> subtraction<00:03:33.139> problem<00:03:33.680> and<00:03:33.919> if

00:03:34.360 --> 00:03:34.370 
it could be a subtraction problem and if

00:03:34.370 --> 00:03:37.240 
it could be a subtraction problem and if
those<00:03:34.549> fractions<00:03:35.150> are<00:03:35.359> getting<00:03:35.690> to<00:03:35.900> you<00:03:36.250> try

00:03:37.240 --> 00:03:37.250 
those fractions are getting to you try

00:03:37.250 --> 00:03:39.580 
those fractions are getting to you try
converting<00:03:37.549> them<00:03:37.849> to<00:03:37.880> money<00:03:38.299> that<00:03:39.139> works

00:03:39.580 --> 00:03:39.590 
converting them to money that works

00:03:39.590 --> 00:03:42.250 
converting them to money that works
really<00:03:40.099> well<00:03:40.370> with<00:03:40.579> halves<00:03:40.940> and<00:03:41.359> fourths<00:03:41.389> not

00:03:42.250 --> 00:03:42.260 
really well with halves and fourths not

00:03:42.260 --> 00:03:45.370 
really well with halves and fourths not
so<00:03:42.470> much<00:03:42.680> with<00:03:42.919> thirds<00:03:43.720> but<00:03:44.720> see<00:03:45.079> if<00:03:45.169> that

00:03:45.370 --> 00:03:45.380 
so much with thirds but see if that

00:03:45.380 --> 00:03:47.769 
so much with thirds but see if that
helps<00:03:45.709> you
