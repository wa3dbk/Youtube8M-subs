wouldn't even climb this a cell or

00:01:20.970 --> 00:01:22.510 
wouldn't even climb this a cell or
anything<00:01:21.450> like<00:01:21.479> that<00:01:21.659> you<00:01:21.960> would<00:01:22.080> just

00:01:22.510 --> 00:01:22.520 
anything like that you would just

00:01:22.520 --> 00:01:24.590 
anything like that you would just
destroy<00:01:23.520> empowerment<00:01:23.939> ground<00:01:24.270> it<00:01:24.360> would<00:01:24.450> take

00:01:24.590 --> 00:01:24.600 
destroy empowerment ground it would take
