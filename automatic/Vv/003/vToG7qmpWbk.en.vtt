00:01:22.039 --> 00:01:22.049 
that striking these meters there we go

00:01:22.049 --> 00:01:24.109 
that striking these meters there we go
and<00:01:22.259> yet<00:01:22.409> what<00:01:22.680> are<00:01:22.799> you<00:01:23.159> it's<00:01:23.460> a<00:01:23.610> really<00:01:23.970> just

00:01:27.140 --> 00:01:27.150 
they're not going to really see you

00:01:27.150 --> 00:01:28.999 
they're not going to really see you
infected<00:01:27.659> so<00:01:27.840> you<00:01:27.930> can<00:01:28.020> survive<00:01:28.350> a<00:01:28.409> long<00:01:28.710> time

00:01:28.999 --> 00:01:29.009 
infected so you can survive a long time

00:01:29.009 --> 00:01:32.090 
infected so you can survive a long time
than<00:01:29.159> 30<00:01:29.400> but<00:01:30.360> what<00:01:30.659> I<00:01:30.689> have<00:01:31.079> found<00:01:31.290> is<00:01:31.650> this

00:01:32.090 --> 00:01:32.100 
than 30 but what I have found is this

00:01:32.100 --> 00:01:37.580 
than 30 but what I have found is this
tree<00:01:32.820> can<00:01:33.090> get<00:01:33.329> me<00:01:35.119> and<00:01:36.119> this<00:01:36.659> is<00:01:36.930> I<00:01:37.200> don't

00:01:37.580 --> 00:01:37.590 
tree can get me and this is I don't

00:01:37.590 --> 00:01:39.319 
tree can get me and this is I don't
think<00:01:37.799> anyone<00:01:38.189> is<00:01:38.310> showing<00:01:38.610> this<00:01:38.700> in<00:01:38.939> any<00:01:39.240> of
