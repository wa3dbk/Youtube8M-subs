00:00:15.260 --> 00:00:23.910
 many tables at the same time for what it is 

00:00:19.320 --> 00:00:26.520
 you need that is for example if you have 

00:00:23.910 --> 00:00:29.520
 small bankroll yes there order well 

00:00:26.520 --> 00:00:34.710
 for example there is 100 dollars yes and you want 

00:00:29.520 --> 00:00:37.650
 play as if with a large variance then you 

00:00:34.710 --> 00:00:39.510
 You can for example open 20 30 tables there 

00:00:37.650 --> 00:00:41.670
 for example on the dollar and quietly play 

00:00:39.510 --> 00:00:43.199
 you these 100 dollars free enough for 

00:00:41.670 --> 00:00:45.870
 balcony to bankroll because if 

00:00:43.199 --> 00:00:47.309
 play tank tournaments for 20 dollars for 30 

00:00:45.870 --> 00:00:51.420
 you do not understand 100 dollars 

00:00:47.309 --> 00:00:54.809
 enough that is dispersion will eat you and how 

00:00:51.420 --> 00:00:57.120
 play a lot of tables start with OPEC 

00:00:54.809 --> 00:00:58.530
 location is better to have 

00:00:57.120 --> 00:01:00.210
 two kinds of arrangement 

00:00:58.530 --> 00:01:03.600
 stage as I have here is 

00:01:00.210 --> 00:01:05.430
 now and there is the usual location for 

00:01:03.600 --> 00:01:08.250
 the whole screen here you do 

00:01:05.430 --> 00:01:13.220
 little cats are like that 

00:01:08.250 --> 00:01:17.580
 the whole screen is drowned by how much they cost 

00:01:13.220 --> 00:01:19.350
 this 34 open people there play lendin 

00:01:17.580 --> 00:01:21.060
 16 tables 24 

00:01:19.350 --> 00:01:24.630
 that is, they make little tables and 

00:01:21.060 --> 00:01:26.850
 have around the screen here about 

00:01:24.630 --> 00:01:29.400
 so what are the pros and cons of these 

00:01:26.850 --> 00:01:31.680
 arrangements of course here if around 

00:01:29.400 --> 00:01:33.450
 the screen has become and pros such 

00:01:31.680 --> 00:01:35.100
 that you immediately see all the tables there 

00:01:33.450 --> 00:01:37.650
 going on minus they are of course very 

00:01:35.100 --> 00:01:40.439
 small and yet limited 

00:01:37.650 --> 00:01:42.180
 screen size there resolution there 16 

00:01:40.439 --> 00:01:44.880
 somewhere around 24 if you have poor eyesight 

00:01:42.180 --> 00:01:46.020
 Of course a lot of tables are difficult right away 

00:01:44.880 --> 00:01:52.200
 keep these little ones 

00:01:46.020 --> 00:01:55.110
 have cascades plus big from cascade that 

00:01:52.200 --> 00:01:58.520
 can become and keep its size and 

00:01:55.110 --> 00:02:02.310
 perfectly see what's going on there 

00:01:58.520 --> 00:02:03.659
 every table and the cascade plus 

00:02:02.310 --> 00:02:05.640
 big is that you can play a lot 

00:02:03.659 --> 00:02:08.190
 tables thirty forty fifty tables 

00:02:05.640 --> 00:02:13.110
 give up because when we become something 

00:02:08.190 --> 00:02:15.030
 happens he immediately comes forward 

00:02:13.110 --> 00:02:18.329
 this table automatically give you there 

00:02:15.030 --> 00:02:20.910
 did for example falls immediately and appears 

00:02:18.329 --> 00:02:22.829
 another table if you need to do something on 

00:02:20.910 --> 00:02:24.990
 here it is plus a big minus of course in that 

00:02:22.829 --> 00:02:27.180
 that you all did not immediately see yah 

00:02:24.990 --> 00:02:29.280
 usually if something happens on 

00:02:27.180 --> 00:02:32.100
 the table he immediately here is this blue strip she 

00:02:29.280 --> 00:02:34.650
 starts blinking and there he is active you 

00:02:32.100 --> 00:02:37.000
 can cross something already on it 

00:02:34.650 --> 00:02:39.620
 table and do 

00:02:37.000 --> 00:02:43.700
 Well this way of course you can play 

00:02:39.620 --> 00:02:45.830
 thirty to forty dining 50 now 

00:02:43.700 --> 00:02:48.440
 how to play a lot of tables 

00:02:45.830 --> 00:02:50.440
 Well, of course there are two tactics tactics 

00:02:48.440 --> 00:02:52.820
 some people play for example 

00:02:50.440 --> 00:02:56.420
 the same as i call the same 

00:02:52.820 --> 00:02:59.000
 hanshin that is, 20 tables load and here 

00:02:56.420 --> 00:03:01.190
 when 19 one table crashes they immediately 

00:02:59.000 --> 00:03:03.830
 one more load and these 20 stacks 

00:03:01.190 --> 00:03:07.550
 there for example they keep there there who 

00:03:03.830 --> 00:03:09.080
 how many can there 2 3 5 10 hours here 

00:03:07.550 --> 00:03:11.030
 second way 

00:03:09.080 --> 00:03:14.959
 he is slower of course too 

00:03:11.030 --> 00:03:17.480
 we load there 20 30 40 to and we play 

00:03:14.959 --> 00:03:19.490
 playable and and almost to the end 

00:03:17.480 --> 00:03:22.040
 they are all holy load thirty-forty 

00:03:19.490 --> 00:03:24.740
 tables play here, plus such that 

00:03:22.040 --> 00:03:27.230
 last for example there are 5-6 topics on the table 

00:03:24.740 --> 00:03:32.240
 they are usually final yes and you can 

00:03:27.230 --> 00:03:34.280
 look much better 

00:03:32.240 --> 00:03:35.870
 rival even study on these five 

00:03:34.280 --> 00:03:37.400
 the tables are still not thirty or forty 

00:03:35.870 --> 00:03:42.230
 rates where there is necessary on the machine all 

00:03:37.400 --> 00:03:44.150
 do i.e. efficiency to be more in 

00:03:42.230 --> 00:03:46.310
 the second case, although there will be fewer tables 

00:03:44.150 --> 00:03:48.489
 well he better it you choose it already 

00:03:46.310 --> 00:03:51.170
 who like to play i saw people play 

00:03:48.489 --> 00:03:56.019
 very good and the first way to play and 

00:03:51.170 --> 00:03:56.019
 second and make good money 

00:03:56.739 --> 00:04:01.010
 further strategy how to play or a lot 

00:03:59.360 --> 00:04:02.600
 tables on many tables of course here 

00:04:01.010 --> 00:04:08.840
 the strategy is quite simple especially on 

00:04:02.600 --> 00:04:10.670
 small limits of five dollars that is 

00:04:08.840 --> 00:04:16.400
 We play as if on the machine on the base 

00:04:10.670 --> 00:04:19.609
 strategy first we type we type we go 

00:04:16.400 --> 00:04:21.859
 Volyn tone where you can and where you can not 

00:04:19.609 --> 00:04:23.510
 dump give more on turbo that's all 

00:04:21.859 --> 00:04:27.370
 happens quickly on the final 

00:04:23.510 --> 00:04:30.350
 Mandate tables are starting to look more 

00:04:27.370 --> 00:04:32.450
 at least trying to somehow study 

00:04:30.350 --> 00:04:34.010
 Of course if there is an opponent and 

00:04:32.450 --> 00:04:36.200
 thirty to forty tables play this 

00:04:34.010 --> 00:04:38.600
 impossible but for example even when 

00:04:36.200 --> 00:04:40.760
 held 30 100 years at the same time tried 

00:04:38.600 --> 00:04:43.280
 there I load up how was the final table 

00:04:40.760 --> 00:04:45.800
 here took so here aside here and 

00:04:43.280 --> 00:04:48.610
 there he paid more attention than 

00:04:45.800 --> 00:04:51.759
 others have become such a tactic 

00:04:48.610 --> 00:04:54.699
 Well, on this, in principle, all that is possible 

00:04:51.759 --> 00:04:56.650
 say on this topic train and 

00:04:54.699 --> 00:04:59.080
 play a lot of tables at least I think there 

00:04:56.650 --> 00:05:01.270
 10 12 then everyone should be able to because 

00:04:59.080 --> 00:05:02.710
 play less online especially on 

00:05:01.270 --> 00:05:04.659
 small sit and go tournaments 

00:05:02.710 --> 00:05:07.120
 limit it just doesn't make sense 

00:05:04.659 --> 00:05:10.120
 and when you learn a lot of tables you 

00:05:07.120 --> 00:05:12.159
 you can even there for 10 cents there 

00:05:10.120 --> 00:05:15.039
 1000 dollars I earn easy 

00:05:12.159 --> 00:05:18.610
 I know a lot of people who do this 

00:05:15.039 --> 00:05:20.439
 before but I repeat that it does not immediately 

00:05:18.610 --> 00:05:23.020
 it turns out you need to practice there 

00:05:20.439 --> 00:05:25.120
 half year balzac can someone 2 

00:05:23.020 --> 00:05:27.639
 maybe someone faster I do not know who 

00:05:25.120 --> 00:05:33.150
 how come all this good luck 

00:05:27.639 --> 00:05:36.479
 subscribe this channel without which 

00:05:33.150 --> 00:05:37.659
 me with whom you can play + 

00:05:36.479 --> 00:05:40.360
 for sure 

00:05:37.659 --> 00:05:43.889
 and without you he cannot exist all 

00:05:40.360 --> 00:05:43.889
 all the luck on the poker has become
