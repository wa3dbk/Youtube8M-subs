00:00:42.200 --> 00:00:42.210 
of playing in a linear fashion you can

00:00:42.210 --> 00:00:45.799 
of playing in a linear fashion you can
choose<00:00:42.719> where<00:00:43.140> you<00:00:43.559> want<00:00:44.190> to<00:00:44.550> start<00:00:44.789> off<00:00:45.090> so

00:02:21.630 --> 00:02:25.020 
enough to do the spider layer without
using<00:02:22.630> a<00:02:22.870> potion<00:02:23.190> so<00:02:24.190> what<00:02:24.370> I'm<00:02:24.460> gonna<00:02:24.610> do<00:02:24.880> is

00:02:25.020 --> 00:02:25.030 
using a potion so what I'm gonna do is

00:02:25.030 --> 00:02:28.110 
using a potion so what I'm gonna do is
I'm<00:02:25.360> gonna<00:02:25.570> keep<00:02:25.870> doing<00:02:26.220> the<00:02:27.220> undead<00:02:27.670> spire

00:02:28.110 --> 00:02:28.120 
I'm gonna keep doing the undead spire

00:02:28.120 --> 00:02:32.130 
I'm gonna keep doing the undead spire
and<00:02:28.950> just<00:02:29.950> keep<00:02:30.160> repeating<00:02:30.400> the<00:02:30.940> level<00:02:31.330> where

00:02:32.130 --> 00:02:32.140 
and just keep repeating the level where

00:02:32.140 --> 00:02:34.260 
and just keep repeating the level where
I<00:02:32.200> can<00:02:32.560> go<00:02:32.740> through<00:02:32.770> it<00:02:33.100> without<00:02:33.580> using<00:02:34.060> a

00:02:34.260 --> 00:02:34.270 
I can go through it without using a

00:02:34.270 --> 00:02:37.110 
I can go through it without using a
potion<00:02:34.950> and<00:02:35.950> I'm<00:02:36.100> just<00:02:36.340> gonna<00:02:36.460> keep<00:02:36.760> doing

00:02:37.110 --> 00:02:37.120 
potion and I'm just gonna keep doing

00:02:37.120 --> 00:02:40.200 
potion and I'm just gonna keep doing
this<00:02:37.270> to<00:02:37.480> level<00:02:37.840> up<00:02:38.080> until<00:02:39.010> I<00:02:39.430> can<00:02:39.880> do<00:02:40.030> the

00:02:40.200 --> 00:02:40.210 
this to level up until I can do the

00:02:40.210 --> 00:02:44.280 
this to level up until I can do the
spider<00:02:40.600> leg<00:02:41.020> without<00:02:41.820> using<00:02:42.820> potions<00:02:43.270> so<00:02:44.050> this

00:02:44.280 --> 00:02:44.290 
spider leg without using potions so this

00:02:44.290 --> 00:02:47.310 
spider leg without using potions so this
would<00:02:44.560> never<00:02:44.830> have<00:02:45.190> to<00:02:45.600> spend<00:02:46.600> any<00:02:46.720> money<00:02:46.960> to

00:02:47.310 --> 00:02:47.320 
would never have to spend any money to

00:02:47.320 --> 00:02:49.710 
would never have to spend any money to
buy<00:02:47.350> potions<00:02:48.130> as<00:02:48.460> you<00:02:48.520> progress<00:02:49.060> through<00:02:49.300> the

00:02:49.710 --> 00:02:49.720 
buy potions as you progress through the

00:02:49.720 --> 00:02:51.630 
buy potions as you progress through the
game<00:02:49.750> you're<00:02:50.230> gonna<00:02:50.350> get<00:02:50.650> different<00:02:50.950> weapons

00:04:08.100 --> 00:04:08.110 
of these weapons are you don't you don't

of these weapons are you don't you don't
need<00:04:08.260> to<00:04:08.320> buy<00:04:08.560> any<00:04:08.860> of<00:04:09.040> them<00:04:09.250> you<00:04:09.400> can<00:04:09.549> just

00:04:09.750 --> 00:04:09.760 
need to buy any of them you can just

00:04:09.760 --> 00:04:13.190 
need to buy any of them you can just
loop<00:04:10.000> them<00:04:10.329> from<00:04:10.600> the<00:04:10.780> level

00:04:13.190 --> 00:04:13.200 
loop them from the level

00:04:13.200 --> 00:04:16.470 
loop them from the level
so<00:04:14.200> you<00:04:14.290> can<00:04:14.560> just<00:04:14.590> equip<00:04:15.160> the<00:04:15.460> better<00:04:15.730> ones<00:04:16.120> as

00:04:16.470 --> 00:04:16.480 
so you can just equip the better ones as

00:04:16.480 --> 00:04:20.460 
so you can just equip the better ones as
you<00:04:16.959> progress<00:04:17.260> through<00:04:17.530> the<00:04:18.100> game<00:04:19.230> do<00:04:20.230> not

00:04:20.460 --> 00:04:20.470 
you progress through the game do not

00:04:20.470 --> 00:04:23.400 
you progress through the game do not
upgrade<00:04:20.709> weapons<00:04:21.540> because<00:04:22.540> they<00:04:22.810> cost<00:04:23.050> a<00:04:23.260> lot

00:04:23.400 --> 00:04:23.410 
upgrade weapons because they cost a lot

00:04:23.410 --> 00:04:26.190 
upgrade weapons because they cost a lot
of<00:04:23.470> money<00:04:23.590> and<00:04:24.160> the<00:04:24.400> success<00:04:24.910> rate<00:04:25.300> is<00:04:25.570> really

00:04:26.190 --> 00:04:26.200 
of money and the success rate is really

00:04:26.200 --> 00:04:28.920 
of money and the success rate is really
low<00:04:26.440> so<00:04:26.860> you<00:04:26.890> could<00:04:27.280> be<00:04:27.460> for<00:04:28.300> example<00:04:28.330> this

00:04:28.920 --> 00:04:28.930 
low so you could be for example this

00:04:28.930 --> 00:04:31.290 
low so you could be for example this
weapon<00:04:29.410> here<00:04:29.740> I've<00:04:30.040> tried<00:04:30.910> to<00:04:31.120> upgrade
