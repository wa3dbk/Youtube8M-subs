00:02:11.259 --> 00:02:11.269 
before so yeah okay in a back walkover

00:02:11.269 --> 00:02:13.210 
before so yeah okay in a back walkover
it's<00:02:12.110> like<00:02:12.260> the<00:02:12.349> same<00:02:12.560> thing<00:02:12.739> you<00:02:12.890> put<00:02:13.069> one

00:02:13.210 --> 00:02:13.220 
it's like the same thing you put one

00:02:13.220 --> 00:02:14.530 
it's like the same thing you put one
foot<00:02:13.459> in<00:02:13.580> front<00:02:13.640> and<00:02:13.879> one<00:02:14.030> foot<00:02:14.209> in<00:02:14.299> the<00:02:14.390> back

00:02:14.540 --> 00:02:16.390 
foot in front and one foot in the back
but<00:02:15.049> it<00:02:15.110> really<00:02:15.500> depends<00:02:15.920> if<00:02:16.010> you're<00:02:16.160> a<00:02:16.190> righty

00:02:16.390 --> 00:02:16.400

or Lefty cuz I'm a righty so I put my
left<00:02:19.370> leg<00:02:19.519> in<00:02:19.640> front<00:02:19.670> so<00:02:20.030> it<00:02:20.090> just<00:02:20.269> comes<00:02:20.450> up

00:02:20.650 --> 00:02:20.660 
left leg in front so it just comes up

00:02:20.660 --> 00:02:23.470

and<00:02:20.870> my<00:02:20.989> right<00:02:21.140> leg<00:02:21.170> kind<00:02:21.530> of<00:02:21.590> pushes<00:02:22.329> you<00:02:23.329> know

00:02:23.470 --> 00:02:23.480 
and my right leg kind of pushes you know

00:02:23.480 --> 00:02:25.720 
and my right leg kind of pushes you know
because<00:02:23.810> it's<00:02:23.959> stronger<00:02:24.280> it's<00:02:25.280> my<00:02:25.400> good<00:02:25.519> leg

00:02:25.720 --> 00:02:25.730

00:02:27.670 --> 00:02:27.680 
if your left you probably doing your

00:02:27.680 --> 00:02:29.770 
if your left you probably doing your

right leg if ride or if you're both or

00:02:29.780 --> 00:02:31.420 
right leg if ride or if you're both or
your<00:02:29.900> lefty<00:02:30.200> doesn't<00:02:30.650> matter<00:02:30.799> but<00:02:31.069> what<00:02:31.340> have

00:02:31.420 --> 00:02:31.430 
your lefty doesn't matter but what have

guess<00:02:35.569> it<00:02:35.720> doesn't<00:02:35.870> matter<00:02:36.170> but<00:02:36.410> it<00:02:37.280> does<00:02:37.310> but

00:02:37.809 --> 00:02:37.819 
guess it doesn't matter but it does but

00:02:37.819 --> 00:02:40.960 
guess it doesn't matter but it does but
you<00:02:38.569> know<00:02:38.720> it<00:02:38.840> depends<00:02:39.400> so<00:02:40.400> I'm<00:02:40.519> gonna<00:02:40.670> put<00:02:40.879> my

00:02:45.610 --> 00:02:45.620 
so it's like doing a back bend let me

00:02:45.620 --> 00:02:50.640 
so it's like doing a back bend let me
show<00:02:45.829> you<00:02:45.970> like<00:02:46.970> doing<00:02:47.180> a<00:02:47.269> back<00:02:47.480> bend<00:02:49.630> except

00:02:50.640 --> 00:02:50.650 
show you like doing a back bend except

00:02:50.650 --> 00:02:53.379 
show you like doing a back bend except
right<00:02:51.650> when<00:02:51.829> you<00:02:51.980> hit<00:02:52.370> the<00:02:52.549> ground<00:02:52.609> like<00:02:53.090> what

00:02:53.379 --> 00:02:53.389 
right when you hit the ground like what

00:02:53.389 --> 00:02:55.569 
right when you hit the ground like what
three<00:02:53.660> hands<00:02:53.870> touch<00:02:54.079> the<00:02:54.109> ground<00:02:54.470> you<00:02:54.829> gotta

00:02:55.569 --> 00:02:55.579 
three hands touch the ground you gotta

00:02:55.579 --> 00:02:59.170 
three hands touch the ground you gotta
lift<00:02:55.849> up<00:02:56.030> your<00:02:56.180> legs<00:02:56.739> so<00:02:57.739> it<00:02:58.579> kind<00:02:58.910> of<00:02:59.000> is

00:02:59.170 --> 00:02:59.180 
lift up your legs so it kind of is

00:02:59.180 --> 00:03:00.670 
lift up your legs so it kind of is
easier<00:02:59.660> than<00:02:59.810> doing<00:02:59.900> a<00:03:00.079> background<00:03:00.260> kick<00:03:00.530> over

00:03:00.670 --> 00:03:00.680 
easier than doing a background kick over

00:03:00.680 --> 00:03:02.319 
easier than doing a background kick over
because<00:03:00.980> you<00:03:01.069> gotta<00:03:01.250> can<00:03:01.519> work<00:03:01.700> harder<00:03:02.090> than

00:03:02.319 --> 00:03:02.329 
because you gotta can work harder than

00:03:02.329 --> 00:03:04.150 
because you gotta can work harder than
that<00:03:02.359> think<00:03:02.660> you<00:03:02.780> go<00:03:02.930> part<00:03:03.139> much<00:03:03.290> the<00:03:04.010> back

00:03:04.150 --> 00:03:04.160 
that think you go part much the back

00:03:04.160 --> 00:03:06.309 
that think you go part much the back
walkover<00:03:04.730> has<00:03:04.940> to<00:03:05.120> take<00:03:05.329> experience<00:03:06.019> in<00:03:06.230> the

00:03:06.309 --> 00:03:06.319 
walkover has to take experience in the

00:03:06.319 --> 00:03:08.699 
walkover has to take experience in the
backbend<00:03:06.709> kickover<00:03:06.739> before<00:03:07.579> you<00:03:07.730> can<00:03:08.209> do<00:03:08.329> it

00:03:08.699 --> 00:03:08.709 
backbend kickover before you can do it

00:03:08.709 --> 00:03:15.190 
backbend kickover before you can do it
so<00:03:09.709> yeah<00:03:10.720> and<00:03:13.599> when<00:03:14.599> you<00:03:14.630> do<00:03:14.870> your<00:03:15.049> back

00:03:15.190 --> 00:03:15.200 
so yeah and when you do your back

00:03:15.200 --> 00:03:17.259 
so yeah and when you do your back
walkover<00:03:15.799> make<00:03:16.669> sure<00:03:16.819> your<00:03:16.940> arms<00:03:17.209> are
