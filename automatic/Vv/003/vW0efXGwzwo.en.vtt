00:01:39.090 --> 00:01:40.490 
effort that would be a really hard
decision<00:01:39.240> to<00:01:39.540> make<00:01:39.720> and<00:01:39.930> the<00:01:40.020> fact<00:01:40.229> that<00:01:40.320> he's

00:01:40.490 --> 00:01:40.500 
decision to make and the fact that he's

00:01:40.500 --> 00:01:42.319 
decision to make and the fact that he's
selling<00:01:40.680> such<00:01:41.130> a<00:01:41.159> vast<00:01:41.490> collection<00:01:41.759> that<00:01:42.180> he's

00:01:42.319 --> 00:01:42.329 
selling such a vast collection that he's

00:01:42.329 --> 00:01:44.240 
selling such a vast collection that he's
he's<00:01:42.930> obviously<00:01:43.380> put<00:01:43.530> a<00:01:43.560> lot<00:01:43.619> of<00:01:43.860> time<00:01:44.009> and

00:01:44.240 --> 00:01:44.250 
he's obviously put a lot of time and

00:01:44.250 --> 00:01:46.280 
he's obviously put a lot of time and
effort<00:01:44.430> and<00:01:44.520> money<00:01:44.610> into<00:01:44.930> it's<00:01:45.930> just<00:01:46.140> really

00:01:46.280 --> 00:01:46.290 
effort and money into it's just really

00:01:46.290 --> 00:01:48.980 
effort and money into it's just really
crazy<00:01:46.590> I<00:01:47.340> was<00:01:48.270> kind<00:01:48.420> of<00:01:48.479> reading<00:01:48.720> it<00:01:48.840> to<00:01:48.930> the

00:01:48.980 --> 00:01:48.990 
crazy I was kind of reading it to the

00:01:48.990 --> 00:01:50.480 
crazy I was kind of reading it to the
story<00:01:49.259> and<00:01:49.560> he<00:01:49.680> said<00:01:49.860> the<00:01:49.950> reason<00:01:50.220> why<00:01:50.310> he's

00:01:50.480 --> 00:01:50.490 
story and he said the reason why he's

00:01:50.490 --> 00:01:52.880 
story and he said the reason why he's
doing<00:01:50.610> it<00:01:50.909> he's<00:01:51.540> got<00:01:51.720> kind<00:01:51.869> of<00:01:51.960> a<00:01:52.049> final<00:01:52.320> kind

00:01:52.880 --> 00:01:52.890 
doing it he's got kind of a final kind

00:01:52.890 --> 00:01:54.649 
doing it he's got kind of a final kind
of<00:01:53.009> a<00:01:53.070> family<00:01:53.399> crisis<00:01:54.180> he's<00:01:54.360> dealing<00:01:54.630> with

00:01:54.649 --> 00:01:54.659 
of a family crisis he's dealing with

00:01:54.659 --> 00:01:56.420 
of a family crisis he's dealing with
that<00:01:55.049> is<00:01:55.320> just<00:01:55.530> kind<00:01:55.680> of<00:01:55.710> taking<00:01:55.979> precedent

00:01:56.420 --> 00:01:56.430 
that is just kind of taking precedent

00:01:56.430 --> 00:01:58.730 
that is just kind of taking precedent
over<00:01:56.460> that<00:01:56.700> so<00:01:57.299> I<00:01:57.329> I<00:01:57.840> can<00:01:58.079> really<00:01:58.290> respect<00:01:58.619> that

I<00:02:15.180> don't<00:02:15.569> know<00:02:15.780> you<00:02:16.170> know<00:02:16.290> if<00:02:16.830> you<00:02:17.069> were<00:02:17.159> to

00:02:17.240 --> 00:02:17.250 
I don't know you know if you were to

00:02:17.250 --> 00:02:18.610 
I don't know you know if you were to
take<00:02:17.370> every<00:02:17.549> one<00:02:17.730> of<00:02:17.760> those<00:02:17.879> games<00:02:18.030> and<00:02:18.269> add<00:02:18.450> up

take every one of those games and add up

00:02:18.620 --> 00:02:21.199 
take every one of those games and add up
if<00:02:19.620> it's<00:02:19.860> even<00:02:20.099> close<00:02:20.340> to<00:02:20.519> what<00:02:20.670> goes<00:02:20.849> with

00:02:21.199 --> 00:02:21.209 
if it's even close to what goes with

00:02:21.209 --> 00:02:22.610 
if it's even close to what goes with
them<00:02:21.390> what<00:02:21.629> the<00:02:21.750> actual<00:02:22.019> value<00:02:22.260> of<00:02:22.470> the

00:02:22.610 --> 00:02:22.620 
them what the actual value of the

00:02:22.620 --> 00:02:24.740 
them what the actual value of the
collections<00:02:23.010> worth<00:02:23.189> but<00:02:23.670> it's<00:02:24.269> still<00:02:24.450> a<00:02:24.510> crazy

00:02:24.740 --> 00:02:24.750 
collections worth but it's still a crazy

00:02:24.750 --> 00:02:27.559 
collections worth but it's still a crazy
number<00:02:25.280> so<00:02:26.280> anyway<00:02:26.640> it's<00:02:27.060> been<00:02:27.269> up<00:02:27.390> there<00:02:27.510> for

00:02:27.559 --> 00:02:27.569 
number so anyway it's been up there for

00:02:27.569 --> 00:02:30.559 
number so anyway it's been up there for
a<00:02:27.750> few<00:02:27.780> days<00:02:28.079> it<00:02:28.409> ends<00:02:28.680> tomorrow<00:02:28.829> night<00:02:29.189> at<00:02:29.569> 10

00:02:30.559 --> 00:02:30.569 
a few days it ends tomorrow night at 10

00:02:30.569 --> 00:02:33.350 
a few days it ends tomorrow night at 10
o'clock<00:02:30.690> Eastern<00:02:31.230> Time<00:02:31.260> and<00:02:32.069> right<00:02:32.730> now<00:02:32.909> it<00:02:33.209> is

00:02:33.350 --> 00:02:33.360 
o'clock Eastern Time and right now it is

00:02:33.360 --> 00:02:34.970 
o'clock Eastern Time and right now it is
at<00:02:33.480> seven<00:02:33.840> hundred<00:02:34.079> fifty<00:02:34.170> thousand<00:02:34.769> five

00:02:34.970 --> 00:02:34.980 
at seven hundred fifty thousand five

00:02:34.980 --> 00:02:36.860 
at seven hundred fifty thousand five
hundred<00:02:35.099> dollars<00:02:35.549> so<00:02:35.819> three<00:02:36.299> quarters<00:02:36.629> of<00:02:36.720> a

00:02:36.860 --> 00:02:36.870 
hundred dollars so three quarters of a

00:02:36.870 --> 00:02:39.619 
hundred dollars so three quarters of a
million<00:02:37.079> dollars<00:02:37.530> and<00:02:38.310> that<00:02:39.000> just<00:02:39.209> blows<00:02:39.420> my

00:02:39.619 --> 00:02:39.629 
million dollars and that just blows my

00:02:39.629 --> 00:02:42.649 
million dollars and that just blows my
mind<00:02:39.840> you<00:02:40.019> know<00:02:40.109> I<00:02:40.140> I<00:02:41.030> can't<00:02:42.030> imagine<00:02:42.180> having
