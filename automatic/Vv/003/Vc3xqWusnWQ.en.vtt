00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:06.089
 yes, I never find the candlestick 

00:00:02.129 --> 00:00:07.799
 as fascinated as now ready people like 

00:00:06.089 --> 00:00:09.809
 promised that current rift is 

00:00:07.799 --> 00:00:11.190
 finally there, unfortunately, with a bit 

00:00:09.809 --> 00:00:13.200
 Delay because I am at the beginning of the 

00:00:11.190 --> 00:00:14.969
 recordings have not gotten that 

00:00:13.200 --> 00:00:16.170
 is just a bit dumpy everything 

00:00:14.969 --> 00:00:17.060
 but I've got it now 

00:00:16.170 --> 00:00:20.430
 hingekriegt 

00:00:17.060 --> 00:00:21.660
 I actually wanted video directly 

00:00:20.430 --> 00:00:23.340
 do as I aufsetzung the first time 

00:00:21.660 --> 00:00:24.810
 how that feels is unfortunately nothing 

00:00:23.340 --> 00:00:26.490
 have just become technical 

00:00:24.810 --> 00:00:29.210
 I had a thousand problems in 

00:00:26.490 --> 00:00:31.320
 but some demo scene jump in but 

00:00:29.210 --> 00:00:32.910
 should I think it's half as crazy 

00:00:31.320 --> 00:00:34.440
 I'll let's go right in 

00:00:32.910 --> 00:00:37.790
 the next the first demo jump in 

00:00:34.440 --> 00:00:37.790
 that it rifles from aquinos 

00:00:40.160 --> 00:00:45.350
 and there we are already right in the 

00:00:42.380 --> 00:00:47.900
 demo i have to watch that i do that 

00:00:45.350 --> 00:00:50.230
 Microphone does not always abut because I 

00:00:47.900 --> 00:00:53.750
 I'm pretty blind I just look easy 

00:00:50.230 --> 00:00:56.390
 duty be key more or 

00:00:53.750 --> 00:00:58.100
 less the keyboard as well as said that 

00:00:56.390 --> 00:01:00.739
 I shows the objective and actually 

00:00:58.100 --> 00:01:01.970
 you best everything with the thing 

00:01:00.739 --> 00:01:03.620
 possible because it feels like 

00:01:01.970 --> 00:01:06.050
 most reliable so far what I am so 

00:01:03.620 --> 00:01:08.090
 but at least tested and it looks 

00:01:06.050 --> 00:01:10.970
 just awesome so this 

00:01:08.090 --> 00:01:13.460
 garden house here it looks only the picture 

00:01:10.970 --> 00:01:20.479
 but that's really awesome you can go with 

00:01:13.460 --> 00:01:23.289
 the head or the lamp you can 

00:01:20.479 --> 00:01:23.289
 look at it here 

00:01:23.410 --> 00:01:27.649
 that is absolutely not comparable to 

00:01:25.670 --> 00:01:29.000
 any 3d cinemas or anything else 

00:01:27.649 --> 00:01:33.289
 All this is a whole new level 

00:01:29.000 --> 00:01:34.550
 from 3d and it's just awesome what 

00:01:33.289 --> 00:01:36.229
 I also let myself be pretty 

00:01:34.550 --> 00:01:38.899
 otherwise you will be looked down and his 

00:01:36.229 --> 00:01:40.490
 hands do not see the microphone for 

00:01:38.899 --> 00:01:42.920
 Quality is getting worse and worse 

00:01:40.490 --> 00:01:44.599
 if I here right away but the me 

00:01:42.920 --> 00:01:47.170
 otherwise it can be really cool here 

00:01:44.599 --> 00:01:47.170
 dabble 

00:01:48.610 --> 00:01:59.720
 i have no line i can unfortunately 

00:01:55.520 --> 00:02:02.090
 not so dangerous 

00:01:59.720 --> 00:02:04.670
 microphone is popping on the beginnings 

00:02:02.090 --> 00:02:07.009
 about the microphone away and on the 

00:02:04.670 --> 00:02:08.690
 investor that the can you can 

00:02:07.009 --> 00:02:10.670
 to judge correctly and the perspective 

00:02:08.690 --> 00:02:11.720
 where you actually have to go for something 

00:02:10.670 --> 00:02:13.520
 you really need it now 

00:02:11.720 --> 00:02:17.420
 So hand controller I say 

00:02:13.520 --> 00:02:18.920
 The little one can but also here 

00:02:17.420 --> 00:02:20.160
 Unfortunately, you can not move yet 

00:02:18.920 --> 00:02:24.360
 the camera 

00:02:20.160 --> 00:02:28.170
 with this look already spenst again 

00:02:24.360 --> 00:02:31.740
 against the microphone and here it is all 

00:02:28.170 --> 00:02:36.810
 a bit boring that happens 

00:02:31.740 --> 00:02:37.710
 Many plants may recommend getting up 

00:02:36.810 --> 00:02:39.720
 But that's all a bit more 

00:02:37.710 --> 00:02:42.540
 Strange lawyer is all so far down 

00:02:39.720 --> 00:02:44.280
 there is a bit andreas left one 

00:02:42.540 --> 00:02:47.100
 other angles for or because you 're sitting 

00:02:44.280 --> 00:02:48.300
 that feels very strange to you 

00:02:47.100 --> 00:02:49.470
 unfortunately can not do much in this demo 

00:02:48.300 --> 00:02:50.580
 That's why I would say 

00:02:49.470 --> 00:02:52.530
 Let's jump in the next one 

00:02:50.580 --> 00:02:54.240
 otherwise it will be a very short episode and 

00:02:52.530 --> 00:02:56.640
 Here we are well known 

00:02:54.240 --> 00:03:03.530
 tuscan demo which unfortunately does not work so 

00:02:56.640 --> 00:03:07.290
 good as that unfortunately not as good as that 

00:03:03.530 --> 00:03:09.090
 config demo because the view is shaking here 

00:03:07.290 --> 00:03:12.860
 if I hook my head publisher then 

00:03:09.090 --> 00:03:14.630
 it causes bad headache 

00:03:12.860 --> 00:03:16.370
 of course, a little more motion victory 

00:03:14.630 --> 00:03:17.360
 if you can move but me 

00:03:16.370 --> 00:03:19.940
 hope then I win only 

00:03:17.360 --> 00:03:20.960
 but somehow they still continue 

00:03:19.940 --> 00:03:23.750
 I do not know why the camera is in 

00:03:20.960 --> 00:03:26.750
 Rheine sight passes here everything is still 

00:03:23.750 --> 00:03:31.340
 kg if they like a hearty but 

00:03:26.750 --> 00:03:35.330
 you see stupid microphone ok to the left 

00:03:31.340 --> 00:03:36.110
 Pan is stupid you can also the 

00:03:35.330 --> 00:03:38.330
 move your head 

00:03:36.110 --> 00:03:41.480
 but what I feel weird about here is 

00:03:38.330 --> 00:03:42.740
 I reach him, so I feel 

00:03:41.480 --> 00:03:44.090
 my head already pretty far out but 

00:03:42.740 --> 00:03:48.170
 The game is actually moving so well 

00:03:44.090 --> 00:03:49.490
 like nothing you can for example 

00:03:48.170 --> 00:03:51.230
 See it here in this window 

00:03:49.490 --> 00:03:53.209
 here we are now a window 

00:03:51.230 --> 00:03:56.150
 I should be pretty much 

00:03:53.209 --> 00:03:59.290
 leaning out of the window like you 

00:03:56.150 --> 00:03:59.290
 now here at the end second 

00:03:59.360 --> 00:04:04.120
 but it somehow feels too little 

00:04:06.940 --> 00:04:12.890
 simply too fat you can get different 

00:04:10.730 --> 00:04:15.040
 now constantly my view of the echo what 

00:04:12.890 --> 00:04:17.109
 to do with 

00:04:15.040 --> 00:04:19.060
 weird pillows 

00:04:17.109 --> 00:04:22.330
 you can see legs that too 

00:04:19.060 --> 00:04:25.330
 strange but otherwise like that said 

00:04:22.330 --> 00:04:26.889
 everything is awesome alf and absolutely not 

00:04:25.330 --> 00:04:28.479
 comparable to any 3d 

00:04:26.889 --> 00:04:31.060
 glasses from the cinema and certainly not 

00:04:28.479 --> 00:04:34.479
 with this line of cinema or from 

00:04:31.060 --> 00:04:36.099
 sony this it that I think so too 

00:04:34.479 --> 00:04:38.680
 with vr but definitely that's just 

00:04:36.099 --> 00:04:41.469
 Such fake 3D glasses just big 

00:04:38.680 --> 00:04:45.789
 monitor in front of your eyes and that is 

00:04:41.469 --> 00:04:48.870
 important here real 3d I mean 

00:04:45.789 --> 00:04:50.979
 right you see everything as if it is 

00:04:48.870 --> 00:04:52.419
 of course it has the best on the 

00:04:50.979 --> 00:04:54.129
 conflict demo works there you could 

00:04:52.419 --> 00:04:56.229
 really to the soldiers the objects 

00:04:54.129 --> 00:05:01.419
 it is not quite close to the grip here 

00:04:56.229 --> 00:05:04.509
 so the feeling but in any case the 

00:05:01.419 --> 00:05:07.779
 can or sprint just meant extreme 

00:05:04.509 --> 00:05:09.520
 always loses the tracking but hey 

00:05:07.779 --> 00:05:12.310
 maybe I already have 

00:05:09.520 --> 00:05:13.900
 left and she got from me 

00:05:12.310 --> 00:05:16.090
 from his room nothing but one 

00:05:13.900 --> 00:05:21.150
 a few points of light through the cart 

00:05:16.090 --> 00:05:23.319
 Ventilation slots come in but no matter 

00:05:21.150 --> 00:05:25.509
 Great in blankets you can not do anything here 

00:05:23.319 --> 00:05:29.229
 There is not even sound because of that 

00:05:25.509 --> 00:05:30.699
 I do not have a headset on and me 

00:05:29.229 --> 00:05:31.839
 think in the future that will be 

00:05:30.699 --> 00:05:33.789
 really cool 

00:05:31.839 --> 00:05:37.870
 the first real games the organ of the 

00:05:33.789 --> 00:05:40.779
 reporters alien horror game when 

00:05:37.870 --> 00:05:42.190
 that comes out that we hora your evil 

00:05:40.779 --> 00:05:44.830
 play by car to 15 quasi 

00:05:42.190 --> 00:05:52.030
 predestined as well as porno 

00:05:44.830 --> 00:05:53.530
 therefore already hammergeil now 

00:05:52.030 --> 00:05:54.730
 would not get sick for through this 

00:05:53.530 --> 00:05:58.170
 whole movement then that will 

00:05:54.730 --> 00:05:58.170
 probably look even fatter 

00:05:59.520 --> 00:06:02.850
 to find 

00:06:03.330 --> 00:06:08.560
 do it right 

00:06:05.640 --> 00:06:13.660
 yes, I never find the candlestick 

00:06:08.560 --> 00:06:15.190
 as fascinated as now that she totally 

00:06:13.660 --> 00:06:20.050
 probably silly on the case 

00:06:15.190 --> 00:06:20.320
 but adworx and is working 

00:06:20.050 --> 00:06:22.720
 Super 

00:06:20.320 --> 00:06:26.260
 you can still easily see the pixels 

00:06:22.720 --> 00:06:28.780
 So you see the pixel that despite 1080p 

00:06:26.260 --> 00:06:30.280
 would be the pedestal is now one has 

00:06:28.780 --> 00:06:31.150
 looks easy here but it is at 

00:06:30.280 --> 00:06:33.400
 not nearly as bad as me 

00:06:31.150 --> 00:06:35.670
 maybe thought it would be easy 

00:06:33.400 --> 00:06:39.250
 small dots as if you are with yours 

00:06:35.670 --> 00:06:40.390
 galaxy smartphone too close to the other way 

00:06:39.250 --> 00:06:42.250
 screen ran then you see 

00:06:40.390 --> 00:06:46.570
 the same points on the big one 

00:06:42.250 --> 00:06:47.860
 what I hope you have 

00:06:46.570 --> 00:06:49.060
 like'm thumbs up when it 

00:06:47.860 --> 00:06:50.560
 you liked subscribe me if 

00:06:49.060 --> 00:06:52.390
 her no wide if you the others 

00:06:50.560 --> 00:06:54.490
 want to see follow there are still coming 

00:06:52.390 --> 00:06:57.600
 the demos in any case 

00:06:54.490 --> 00:06:59.860
 I will also play horror games 

00:06:57.600 --> 00:07:03.940
 I hope you liked it gives more 

00:06:59.860 --> 00:07:07.030
 Flippers flop I knew was for them 

00:07:03.940 --> 00:07:10.470
 what do I actually gamble then 

00:07:07.030 --> 00:07:10.470
 yes nothing against horror games but 

00:07:12.490 --> 00:07:15.490
 si
