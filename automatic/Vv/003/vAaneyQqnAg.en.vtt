if<00:02:00.149> you<00:02:00.450> got<00:02:00.810> high<00:02:01.200> water<00:02:01.500> on<00:02:01.710> one<00:02:01.920> side<00:02:02.159> of<00:02:02.369> al

00:02:02.480 --> 00:02:02.490 
if you got high water on one side of al

00:02:02.490 --> 00:02:04.370 
if you got high water on one side of al
fe<00:02:02.640> you<00:02:02.939> got<00:02:03.119> lower<00:02:03.719> water

00:02:04.370 --> 00:02:04.380 
fe you got lower water

00:02:04.380 --> 00:02:06.679 
fe you got lower water
over<00:02:04.530> here<00:02:04.799> it<00:02:05.399> wants<00:02:05.670> to<00:02:05.820> go<00:02:05.969> to<00:02:06.030> get<00:02:06.299> equal

00:02:06.679 --> 00:02:06.689 
over here it wants to go to get equal

San<00:02:07.560> boils<00:02:08.099> is<00:02:08.280> a<00:02:08.310> way<00:02:08.580> that<00:02:08.910> the<00:02:09.030> water<00:02:09.270> seeps

00:02:09.680 --> 00:02:09.690 
San boils is a way that the water seeps

00:02:09.690 --> 00:02:11.330 
San boils is a way that the water seeps
under<00:02:10.050> the<00:02:10.170> levee<00:02:10.380> or<00:02:10.590> through<00:02:10.800> the<00:02:10.890> levee<00:02:11.099> to

damage the integrity of the levee the
significant<00:02:29.819> things<00:02:30.060> that<00:02:30.330> we<00:02:30.450> look<00:02:30.630> for<00:02:30.660> is

00:02:31.270 --> 00:02:31.280 
significant things that we look for is

00:02:31.280 --> 00:02:34.220 
significant things that we look for is
actual<00:02:32.280> material<00:02:32.849> flowing<00:02:33.150> in<00:02:33.540> the<00:02:33.989> water

00:02:34.220 --> 00:02:34.230 
actual material flowing in the water

00:02:34.230 --> 00:02:36.170 
actual material flowing in the water
that's<00:02:34.500> seeping<00:02:34.920> under<00:02:35.040> the<00:02:35.280> levee<00:02:35.489> we<00:02:36.030> have

00:02:36.170 --> 00:02:36.180 
that's seeping under the levee we have

00:02:36.180 --> 00:02:37.670 
that's seeping under the levee we have
indications<00:02:36.810> of<00:02:36.900> the<00:02:36.959> material<00:02:37.440> movement

00:02:37.670 --> 00:02:37.680 
indications of the material movement

00:02:37.680 --> 00:02:40.699 
indications of the material movement
then<00:02:38.340> we<00:02:38.519> we<00:02:38.910> have<00:02:39.060> more<00:02:39.299> concern<00:02:39.750> about<00:02:40.080> the

00:02:40.699 --> 00:02:40.709 
then we we have more concern about the

00:02:40.709 --> 00:02:44.479 
then we we have more concern about the
integrity<00:02:41.010> of<00:02:41.250> the<00:02:41.430> levee<00:02:43.370> some<00:02:44.370> of<00:02:44.430> the

00:02:44.479 --> 00:02:44.489 
integrity of the levee some of the

00:02:44.489 --> 00:02:46.220 
integrity of the levee some of the
things<00:02:44.640> we<00:02:44.790> do<00:02:44.970> to<00:02:45.150> control<00:02:45.540> this<00:02:45.720> flow<00:02:46.019> or

00:02:46.220 --> 00:02:46.230 
things we do to control this flow or

00:02:46.230 --> 00:02:48.140 
things we do to control this flow or
monitor<00:02:46.680> it<00:02:46.799> is<00:02:46.920> we<00:02:47.099> install<00:02:47.459> relief<00:02:47.849> wells

00:02:48.140 --> 00:02:48.150 
monitor it is we install relief wells

00:02:48.150 --> 00:02:50.360 
monitor it is we install relief wells
right<00:02:48.959> now<00:02:49.140> we<00:02:49.200> have<00:02:49.349> nine<00:02:49.709> relief<00:02:49.950> wells

00:02:50.360 --> 00:02:50.370 
right now we have nine relief wells

00:02:50.370 --> 00:02:52.070 
right now we have nine relief wells
installed<00:02:50.910> out<00:02:51.060> and<00:02:51.420> you<00:02:51.630> too<00:02:51.840> then

00:02:52.070 --> 00:02:52.080 
installed out and you too then

00:02:52.080 --> 00:02:55.160 
installed out and you too then
there<00:02:52.940> for<00:02:53.940> a<00:02:53.970> couple<00:02:54.090> years<00:02:54.299> now<00:02:54.599> and<00:02:55.019> that

00:02:55.160 --> 00:02:55.170 
there for a couple years now and that

00:02:55.170 --> 00:02:57.229 
there for a couple years now and that
helps<00:02:55.470> control<00:02:55.799> that<00:02:56.010> pressure<00:02:56.310> we<00:02:56.940> get<00:02:57.120> the

00:02:57.229 --> 00:02:57.239 
helps control that pressure we get the

00:02:57.239 --> 00:02:58.940 
helps control that pressure we get the
water<00:02:57.450> flowing<00:02:57.720> from<00:02:58.110> one<00:02:58.170> side<00:02:58.530> of<00:02:58.560> the<00:02:58.739> levee

00:02:58.940 --> 00:02:58.950 
water flowing from one side of the levee

00:02:58.950 --> 00:03:01.520 
water flowing from one side of the levee
to<00:02:59.130> the<00:02:59.250> interior<00:03:00.000> side<00:03:00.450> at<00:03:00.930> those<00:03:01.290> locations

00:03:01.520 --> 00:03:01.530 
to the interior side at those locations

00:03:01.530 --> 00:03:03.819 
to the interior side at those locations
we<00:03:02.069> can<00:03:02.190> go<00:03:02.310> out<00:03:02.459> montour<00:03:02.880> how<00:03:02.940> much<00:03:03.120> water

00:03:03.819 --> 00:03:03.829 
we can go out montour how much water

00:03:03.829 --> 00:03:06.490 
we can go out montour how much water
what's<00:03:04.829> in<00:03:05.099> the<00:03:05.190> water<00:03:05.370> and<00:03:05.640> how<00:03:05.760> it's<00:03:06.030> flowing

00:03:06.490 --> 00:03:06.500 
what's in the water and how it's flowing

00:03:06.500 --> 00:03:09.830 
what's in the water and how it's flowing
so<00:03:07.500> that<00:03:07.680> up<00:03:07.950> to<00:03:08.190> today<00:03:08.760> it<00:03:08.819> has<00:03:09.030> been<00:03:09.239> working

00:03:09.830 --> 00:03:09.840 
so that up to today it has been working

00:03:09.840 --> 00:03:13.160 
so that up to today it has been working
well<00:03:09.989> but<00:03:10.260> after<00:03:10.650> the<00:03:10.799> tent<00:03:11.459> event<00:03:11.900> we<00:03:12.900> knew<00:03:13.049> we

00:03:13.160 --> 00:03:13.170 
well but after the tent event we knew we

00:03:13.170 --> 00:03:14.720 
well but after the tent event we knew we
needed<00:03:13.319> to<00:03:13.500> do<00:03:13.650> something<00:03:13.920> else<00:03:14.190> to<00:03:14.430> reduce

00:03:14.720 --> 00:03:14.730 
needed to do something else to reduce

00:03:14.730 --> 00:03:16.699 
needed to do something else to reduce
the<00:03:15.000> level<00:03:15.660> of<00:03:15.720> briskets<00:03:16.170> out<00:03:16.350> there<00:03:16.560> because

00:03:16.699 --> 00:03:16.709 
the level of briskets out there because

00:03:16.709 --> 00:03:18.830 
the level of briskets out there because
we<00:03:16.950> just<00:03:17.100> couldn't<00:03:17.430> keep<00:03:18.000> having<00:03:18.390> and<00:03:18.540> come<00:03:18.690> up

00:03:18.830 --> 00:03:18.840 
we just couldn't keep having and come up

00:03:18.840 --> 00:03:20.900 
we just couldn't keep having and come up
through<00:03:19.049> the<00:03:19.079> ground<00:03:19.519> so<00:03:20.519> we<00:03:20.609> started

00:03:20.900 --> 00:03:20.910 
through the ground so we started

00:03:20.910 --> 00:03:22.910 
through the ground so we started
developing<00:03:21.420> the<00:03:21.630> construction<00:03:22.230> plans<00:03:22.500> to

00:03:22.910 --> 00:03:22.920 
developing the construction plans to

00:03:22.920 --> 00:03:25.580 
developing the construction plans to
install<00:03:23.639> a<00:03:23.819> burn<00:03:24.239> out<00:03:24.690> there<00:03:25.049> in<00:03:25.170> that<00:03:25.290> area

00:03:25.580 --> 00:03:25.590 
install a burn out there in that area

00:03:25.590 --> 00:03:28.879 
install a burn out there in that area
about<00:03:26.160> 2,000<00:03:26.850> people<00:03:27.060> and<00:03:27.690> install<00:03:28.530> relief

00:03:28.879 --> 00:03:28.889 
about 2,000 people and install relief

00:03:28.889 --> 00:03:30.590 
about 2,000 people and install relief
wells<00:03:29.160> similar<00:03:29.850> to<00:03:29.970> what's<00:03:30.150> already<00:03:30.299> out

00:03:30.590 --> 00:03:30.600 
wells similar to what's already out

00:03:30.600 --> 00:03:32.840 
wells similar to what's already out
there<00:03:30.750> just<00:03:31.170> about<00:03:31.380> a<00:03:31.440> quarter<00:03:31.799> mile<00:03:32.010> north<00:03:32.730> of

00:03:32.840 --> 00:03:32.850 
there just about a quarter mile north of

00:03:32.850 --> 00:03:35.870 
there just about a quarter mile north of
that<00:03:33.060> site<00:03:33.420> and<00:03:34.290> we<00:03:34.799> felt<00:03:35.040> at<00:03:35.250> that<00:03:35.280> time<00:03:35.459> that

00:03:35.870 --> 00:03:35.880 
that site and we felt at that time that

00:03:35.880 --> 00:03:37.819 
that site and we felt at that time that
would<00:03:35.970> get<00:03:36.180> us<00:03:36.209> back<00:03:36.510> up<00:03:36.750> to<00:03:36.930> the<00:03:36.959> normal<00:03:37.470> level

00:03:37.819 --> 00:03:37.829 
would get us back up to the normal level

00:03:37.829 --> 00:03:40.400 
would get us back up to the normal level
of<00:03:38.069> risk<00:03:38.609> that<00:03:38.819> we<00:03:39.000> would<00:03:39.180> have<00:03:39.389> for<00:03:39.750> a<00:03:39.780> flood

00:03:40.400 --> 00:03:40.410 
of risk that we would have for a flood

00:03:40.410 --> 00:03:43.610 
of risk that we would have for a flood
event<00:03:41.420> takes<00:03:42.420> a<00:03:42.510> little<00:03:42.630> bit<00:03:42.780> of<00:03:42.840> time<00:03:43.019> funding

00:03:43.610 --> 00:03:43.620 
event takes a little bit of time funding

00:03:43.620 --> 00:03:45.800 
event takes a little bit of time funding
to<00:03:43.739> get<00:03:43.889> all<00:03:44.010> that<00:03:44.190> done<00:03:44.489> we<00:03:45.150> come<00:03:45.359> up<00:03:45.540> to<00:03:45.690> the

00:03:45.800 --> 00:03:45.810 
to get all that done we come up to the

00:03:45.810 --> 00:03:48.229 
to get all that done we come up to the
event<00:03:45.930> here<00:03:46.500> and<00:03:46.709> this<00:03:47.190> year<00:03:47.459> about<00:03:47.760> six<00:03:48.090> weeks

00:03:48.229 --> 00:03:48.239 
event here and this year about six weeks

00:03:48.239 --> 00:03:51.289 
event here and this year about six weeks
ago<00:03:48.420> where<00:03:48.750> the<00:03:48.870> water<00:03:49.079> came<00:03:49.319> up<00:03:49.530> with<00:03:49.739> 43<00:03:50.299> plus

00:03:51.289 --> 00:03:51.299 
ago where the water came up with 43 plus

00:03:51.299 --> 00:03:54.259 
ago where the water came up with 43 plus
feet<00:03:51.980> we<00:03:52.980> had<00:03:53.130> more<00:03:53.340> a<00:03:53.579> couple<00:03:53.880> more<00:03:54.000> sand

00:03:54.259 --> 00:03:54.269 
feet we had more a couple more sand

00:03:54.269 --> 00:03:56.780 
feet we had more a couple more sand
boils<00:03:54.450> became<00:03:55.139> evident<00:03:55.380> the<00:03:56.340> levee<00:03:56.549> board

00:03:56.780 --> 00:03:56.790 
boils became evident the levee board

00:03:56.790 --> 00:03:59.059 
boils became evident the levee board
went<00:03:57.120> out<00:03:57.269> and<00:03:57.569> did<00:03:58.350> their<00:03:58.380> standard

00:03:59.059 --> 00:03:59.069 
went out and did their standard

00:03:59.069 --> 00:04:00.770 
went out and did their standard
procedure<00:03:59.459> when<00:03:59.609> you<00:03:59.790> do<00:03:59.940> get<00:04:00.090> a<00:04:00.150> San<00:04:00.420> boil

00:04:00.770 --> 00:04:00.780 
procedure when you do get a San boil

00:04:00.780 --> 00:04:03.349 
procedure when you do get a San boil
which<00:04:01.380> is<00:04:01.650> to<00:04:01.920> take<00:04:02.099> sand<00:04:02.579> bags<00:04:02.849> and<00:04:03.209> bring

00:04:03.349 --> 00:04:03.359 
which is to take sand bags and bring

00:04:03.359 --> 00:04:06.770 
which is to take sand bags and bring
around<00:04:03.690> it<00:04:03.900> bring<00:04:04.440> up<00:04:04.590> the<00:04:04.620> elevation<00:04:05.400> and<00:04:05.780> you

00:04:06.770 --> 00:04:06.780 
around it bring up the elevation and you

00:04:06.780 --> 00:04:08.449 
around it bring up the elevation and you
know<00:04:06.870> same<00:04:07.109> thing<00:04:07.139> on<00:04:07.440> a<00:04:07.500> small<00:04:07.829> scale<00:04:08.160> you

00:04:08.449 --> 00:04:08.459 
know same thing on a small scale you

00:04:08.459 --> 00:04:09.040 
know same thing on a small scale you
build<00:04:08.700> up<00:04:08.819> the

00:04:09.040 --> 00:04:09.050 
build up the

00:04:09.050 --> 00:04:11.200 
build up the
sandbags<00:04:09.470> you<00:04:09.710> get<00:04:09.860> higher<00:04:10.070> elevation<00:04:10.790> the

00:04:11.200 --> 00:04:11.210 
sandbags you get higher elevation the

00:04:11.210 --> 00:04:13.900 
sandbags you get higher elevation the
water<00:04:11.450> kind<00:04:11.780> of<00:04:11.900> gets<00:04:12.050> to<00:04:12.140> equal<00:04:12.620> we<00:04:13.520> never<00:04:13.700> get

00:04:13.900 --> 00:04:13.910 
water kind of gets to equal we never get

00:04:13.910 --> 00:04:15.220 
water kind of gets to equal we never get
the<00:04:13.970> equal<00:04:14.330> because<00:04:14.450> the<00:04:14.660> river<00:04:14.840> is<00:04:14.930> always

00:04:15.220 --> 00:04:15.230 
the equal because the river is always

00:04:15.230 --> 00:04:16.780 
the equal because the river is always
going<00:04:15.350> to<00:04:15.440> be<00:04:15.470> a<00:04:15.530> little<00:04:15.680> higher<00:04:15.980> but<00:04:16.310> that's

00:04:16.780 --> 00:04:16.790 
going to be a little higher but that's

00:04:16.790 --> 00:04:18.490 
going to be a little higher but that's
what<00:04:17.000> we<00:04:17.090> have<00:04:17.239> the<00:04:17.390> levee<00:04:17.600> so<00:04:17.900> that's<00:04:18.080> okay

00:04:18.490 --> 00:04:18.500 
what we have the levee so that's okay

00:04:18.500 --> 00:04:21.640 
what we have the levee so that's okay
they<00:04:19.160> did<00:04:19.400> that<00:04:19.690> we're<00:04:20.690> not<00:04:20.870> we're<00:04:21.049> ok<00:04:21.410> we're

00:04:21.640 --> 00:04:21.650 
they did that we're not we're ok we're

00:04:21.650 --> 00:04:23.170 
they did that we're not we're ok we're
going<00:04:21.769> to<00:04:21.830> award<00:04:21.950> a<00:04:22.160> construction<00:04:22.700> contract

00:04:23.170 --> 00:04:23.180 
going to award a construction contract

00:04:23.180 --> 00:04:25.210 
going to award a construction contract
in<00:04:23.390> the<00:04:23.840> fall<00:04:24.080> and<00:04:24.380> have<00:04:24.800> a<00:04:24.830> permanent

00:04:25.210 --> 00:04:25.220 
in the fall and have a permanent

00:04:25.220 --> 00:04:29.650 
in the fall and have a permanent
solution<00:04:25.970> in<00:04:26.770> then<00:04:27.770> a<00:04:27.800> week<00:04:28.130> ago<00:04:28.430> we<00:04:29.240> get<00:04:29.450> word

00:04:29.650 --> 00:04:29.660 
solution in then a week ago we get word

00:04:29.660 --> 00:04:31.420 
solution in then a week ago we get word
you<00:04:30.020> know<00:04:30.110> the<00:04:30.200> prediction<00:04:30.680> is<00:04:30.860> the<00:04:31.100> river<00:04:31.310> is

00:04:31.420 --> 00:04:31.430 
you know the prediction is the river is

00:04:31.430 --> 00:04:33.880 
you know the prediction is the river is
going<00:04:31.550> to<00:04:31.610> go<00:04:31.700> back<00:04:31.910> up<00:04:31.940> again<00:04:32.450> and<00:04:32.630> get<00:04:32.890> last

00:04:33.880 --> 00:04:33.890 
going to go back up again and get last

00:04:33.890 --> 00:04:37.540 
going to go back up again and get last
week<00:04:34.190> it<00:04:34.430> was<00:04:34.540> going<00:04:35.540> to<00:04:35.630> be<00:04:35.930> at<00:04:36.080> about<00:04:36.170> 44<00:04:36.920> so

00:04:37.540 --> 00:04:37.550 
week it was going to be at about 44 so

00:04:37.550 --> 00:04:39.580 
week it was going to be at about 44 so
that<00:04:37.700> was<00:04:37.910> similar<00:04:38.180> to<00:04:38.360> the<00:04:38.780> situation<00:04:38.990> we<00:04:39.470> had

00:04:39.580 --> 00:04:39.590 
that was similar to the situation we had

00:04:39.590 --> 00:04:43.000 
that was similar to the situation we had
earlier<00:04:39.800> we<00:04:40.700> decided<00:04:41.300> the<00:04:42.080> best<00:04:42.110> solution<00:04:42.830> was

00:04:43.000 --> 00:04:43.010 
earlier we decided the best solution was

00:04:43.010 --> 00:04:45.070 
earlier we decided the best solution was
the<00:04:43.190> taste<00:04:43.400> about<00:04:43.790> a<00:04:43.820> two<00:04:44.120> acre<00:04:44.270> area<00:04:44.690> out

00:04:45.070 --> 00:04:45.080 
the taste about a two acre area out

00:04:45.080 --> 00:04:48.820 
the taste about a two acre area out
there<00:04:45.110> and<00:04:45.680> you<00:04:46.280> you<00:04:47.000> know<00:04:47.090> a<00:04:47.210> big<00:04:47.680> ring<00:04:48.680> around

00:04:48.820 --> 00:04:48.830 
there and you you know a big ring around

00:04:48.830 --> 00:04:50.980 
there and you you know a big ring around
it<00:04:49.130> to<00:04:49.610> her<00:04:49.700> building<00:04:50.090> birth<00:04:50.480> dates<00:04:50.780> around

00:04:50.980 --> 00:04:50.990 
it to her building birth dates around

00:04:50.990 --> 00:04:52.780 
it to her building birth dates around
that<00:04:51.410> and<00:04:51.860> we're<00:04:52.010> going<00:04:52.160> to<00:04:52.190> back<00:04:52.370> fill<00:04:52.610> it

00:04:52.780 --> 00:04:52.790 
that and we're going to back fill it

00:04:52.790 --> 00:04:54.490 
that and we're going to back fill it
with<00:04:52.940> sand<00:04:53.150> to<00:04:53.420> keep<00:04:53.450> the<00:04:53.750> pressure<00:04:53.990> on<00:04:54.170> the

00:04:54.490 --> 00:04:54.500 
with sand to keep the pressure on the

00:04:54.500 --> 00:04:56.890 
with sand to keep the pressure on the
ground<00:04:54.800> and<00:04:55.160> allow<00:04:56.000> that<00:04:56.060> water<00:04:56.450> to<00:04:56.690> flow

00:04:56.890 --> 00:04:56.900 
ground and allow that water to flow

00:04:56.900 --> 00:04:58.600 
ground and allow that water to flow
through<00:04:57.230> there<00:04:57.410> but<00:04:57.440> without<00:04:57.890> the<00:04:57.950> wells<00:04:58.310> it's

00:04:58.600 --> 00:04:58.610 
through there but without the wells it's

00:04:58.610 --> 00:05:01.090 
through there but without the wells it's
a<00:04:58.760> temporary<00:04:59.120> solution<00:04:59.660> and<00:05:00.530> we'd<00:05:00.710> still<00:05:00.950> go

00:05:01.090 --> 00:05:01.100 
a temporary solution and we'd still go

00:05:01.100 --> 00:05:02.950 
a temporary solution and we'd still go
in<00:05:01.310> toward<00:05:01.610> the<00:05:01.700> contract<00:05:02.270> in<00:05:02.480> the<00:05:02.510> fall<00:05:02.780> that

00:05:02.950 --> 00:05:02.960 
in toward the contract in the fall that

00:05:02.960 --> 00:05:04.780 
in toward the contract in the fall that
continued<00:05:03.440> that<00:05:03.650> with<00:05:04.280> the<00:05:04.400> permanent

00:05:04.780 --> 00:05:04.790 
continued that with the permanent

00:05:04.790 --> 00:05:10.030 
continued that with the permanent
solution<00:05:06.070> that<00:05:07.070> was<00:05:07.340> last<00:05:08.560> Wednesday<00:05:09.560> or<00:05:09.770> so

00:05:10.030 --> 00:05:10.040 
solution that was last Wednesday or so

00:05:10.040 --> 00:05:11.950 
solution that was last Wednesday or so
where<00:05:10.670> we<00:05:10.760> made<00:05:10.970> that<00:05:11.180> me<00:05:11.360> were<00:05:11.540> looking<00:05:11.870> at

00:05:11.950 --> 00:05:11.960 
where we made that me were looking at

00:05:11.960 --> 00:05:13.720 
where we made that me were looking at
that<00:05:12.110> Thursday<00:05:12.710> we<00:05:12.830> said<00:05:12.980> okay<00:05:13.220> we<00:05:13.340> need<00:05:13.490> to<00:05:13.580> do

which<00:05:33.560> is<00:05:33.590> where<00:05:33.860> we've<00:05:33.980> been<00:05:34.130> golden<00:05:34.400> study

00:05:34.690 --> 00:05:34.700 
which is where we've been golden study

00:05:34.700 --> 00:05:38.560 
which is where we've been golden study
have<00:05:35.530> given<00:05:36.530> that<00:05:36.740> we<00:05:37.520> did<00:05:37.730> not<00:05:37.760> you<00:05:38.330> know<00:05:38.419> the

00:05:38.560 --> 00:05:38.570 
have given that we did not you know the

00:05:38.570 --> 00:05:40.780 
have given that we did not you know the
risk<00:05:38.780> again<00:05:39.380> your<00:05:39.740> water<00:05:39.980> level<00:05:40.310> just<00:05:40.400> went<00:05:40.520> up

00:05:40.780 --> 00:05:40.790 
risk again your water level just went up

00:05:40.790 --> 00:05:43.570 
risk again your water level just went up
higher<00:05:41.000> and<00:05:41.360> we're<00:05:41.870> still<00:05:42.140> on<00:05:42.890> the<00:05:43.100> inside<00:05:43.430> at

00:05:43.570 --> 00:05:43.580 
higher and we're still on the inside at

00:05:43.580 --> 00:05:45.370 
higher and we're still on the inside at
this<00:05:43.790> level<00:05:44.000> so<00:05:44.270> we<00:05:44.390> felt<00:05:44.810> we<00:05:44.960> need<00:05:45.140> to<00:05:45.230> do

00:05:45.370 --> 00:05:45.380 
this level so we felt we need to do

00:05:45.380 --> 00:05:47.440 
this level so we felt we need to do
something<00:05:45.410> to<00:05:46.400> get<00:05:46.520> these<00:05:46.730> water<00:05:47.000> levels

00:05:47.440 --> 00:05:47.450 
something to get these water levels

00:05:47.450 --> 00:05:53.230 
something to get these water levels
closer<00:05:47.990> to<00:05:48.320> normal<00:05:48.470> thank<00:05:49.430> you<00:05:49.550> said<00:05:49.880> that<00:05:52.240> so

closer to normal thank you said that so

00:05:53.240 --> 00:05:54.760 
closer to normal thank you said that so

here I think you're probably more

00:05:55.940 --> 00:05:58.150 
here I think you're probably more
familiar<00:05:56.000> with<00:05:56.419> your<00:05:56.690> elevations<00:05:57.380> rather

00:05:58.150 --> 00:05:58.160 
familiar with your elevations rather

00:05:58.160 --> 00:06:00.370 
familiar with your elevations rather

00:06:13.870 --> 00:06:13.880 
ground in the punctured 79 so it's

00:06:13.880 --> 00:06:17.680 
ground in the punctured 79 so it's
yeah<00:06:14.180> 30<00:06:15.580> about<00:06:16.580> 30<00:06:16.850> foot<00:06:17.150> difference<00:06:17.360> in

00:06:17.680 --> 00:06:17.690 
yeah 30 about 30 foot difference in

00:06:17.690 --> 00:06:19.840 
yeah 30 about 30 foot difference in
elevation<00:06:17.810> pretty<00:06:18.620> significant<00:06:19.250> difference

00:06:19.840 --> 00:06:19.850 
elevation pretty significant difference

00:06:19.850 --> 00:06:22.030 
elevation pretty significant difference
in<00:06:20.000> heads<00:06:20.270> have<00:06:20.540> water<00:06:20.930> to<00:06:21.290> give<00:06:21.620> you<00:06:21.710> a<00:06:21.770> lot<00:06:21.920> of

00:06:22.030 --> 00:06:22.040 
in heads have water to give you a lot of

00:06:22.040 --> 00:06:25.990 
in heads have water to give you a lot of
pressure<00:06:22.280> that<00:06:22.430> wants<00:06:22.730> to<00:06:22.850> go<00:06:22.970> to<00:06:23.240> their<00:06:25.000> Eagle

00:06:25.990 --> 00:06:26.000 
pressure that wants to go to their Eagle

00:06:26.000 --> 00:06:31.200 
pressure that wants to go to their Eagle
Lake<00:06:26.150> is<00:06:26.420> that<00:06:27.040> seventy<00:06:28.040> seven<00:06:28.550> six<00:06:29.480> today

00:06:31.200 --> 00:06:31.210 
Lake is that seventy seven six today

00:06:31.210 --> 00:06:35.990 
Lake is that seventy seven six today
the<00:06:32.210> white<00:06:32.390> cloak

00:06:35.990 --> 00:06:36.000 

00:06:36.000 --> 00:06:39.209 

so<00:06:37.000> the<00:06:37.210> lake<00:06:37.419> will<00:06:37.780> drain<00:06:38.080> water<00:06:38.620> from<00:06:38.830> money

00:06:39.209 --> 00:06:39.219 
so the lake will drain water from money

00:06:39.219 --> 00:06:40.980 
so the lake will drain water from money
bio<00:06:39.460> structure<00:06:40.060> into<00:06:40.389> the<00:06:40.509> lake<00:06:40.689> they've

00:06:40.980 --> 00:06:40.990 
bio structure into the lake they've

00:06:40.990 --> 00:06:42.540 
bio structure into the lake they've
raised<00:06:41.229> the<00:06:41.439> lake<00:06:41.620> up<00:06:41.830> that<00:06:42.129> will<00:06:42.310> gain<00:06:42.490> us

00:06:42.540 --> 00:06:42.550 
raised the lake up that will gain us

00:06:42.550 --> 00:06:46.290 
raised the lake up that will gain us
about<00:06:43.389> 13<00:06:43.900> feet<00:06:44.199> in<00:06:44.379> elevation<00:06:44.469> so<00:06:45.300> we're

00:06:46.290 --> 00:06:46.300 
about 13 feet in elevation so we're

00:06:46.300 --> 00:06:47.790 
about 13 feet in elevation so we're
going<00:06:46.389> to<00:06:46.479> come<00:06:46.659> up<00:06:46.810> on<00:06:46.990> the<00:06:47.139> interior<00:06:47.469> which

00:06:47.790 --> 00:06:47.800 
going to come up on the interior which

00:06:47.800 --> 00:06:49.439 
going to come up on the interior which
will<00:06:47.979> relieve<00:06:48.370> that<00:06:48.400> pressure<00:06:48.789> in<00:06:49.150> the<00:06:49.240> water

00:06:49.439 --> 00:06:49.449 
will relieve that pressure in the water

00:06:49.449 --> 00:06:53.040 
will relieve that pressure in the water
and<00:06:49.599> what<00:06:49.750> to<00:06:49.840> come<00:06:50.020> under<00:06:50.289> the<00:06:50.409> levee<00:06:52.050> we're

00:06:53.040 --> 00:06:53.050 
and what to come under the levee we're

00:06:53.050 --> 00:06:55.230 
and what to come under the levee we're
going<00:06:53.169> to<00:06:53.229> start<00:06:53.289> doing<00:06:53.560> that<00:06:53.949> early<00:06:54.520> Saturday

00:06:55.230 --> 00:06:55.240

morning will open the structure and

00:06:57.490 --> 00:07:00.360 
morning will open the structure and
start<00:06:57.789> let<00:06:57.969> water<00:06:58.180> flow<00:06:58.330> in<00:06:59.189> we're<00:07:00.189> going<00:07:00.310> to

00:07:00.360 --> 00:07:00.370 
start let water flow in we're going to

00:07:00.370 --> 00:07:04.520 
start let water flow in we're going to
go<00:07:00.719> slowly<00:07:01.719> at<00:07:01.990> the<00:07:02.139> beginning<00:07:02.610> by<00:07:03.610> noon<00:07:03.939> on

out<00:07:07.990> on<00:07:08.139> the<00:07:08.259> life<00:07:08.439> I<00:07:08.770> think<00:07:09.759> that's<00:07:09.909> about

00:07:10.110 --> 00:07:10.120 
out on the life I think that's about

00:07:10.120 --> 00:07:12.240 
out on the life I think that's about
where<00:07:10.479> a<00:07:10.750> lot<00:07:11.229> of<00:07:11.259> the<00:07:11.409> dock<00:07:11.620> start<00:07:12.009> getting

00:07:12.240 --> 00:07:12.250 
where a lot of the dock start getting

00:07:12.250 --> 00:07:14.129 
where a lot of the dock start getting
impacted<00:07:12.520> that<00:07:12.879> are<00:07:12.969> out<00:07:13.090> there<00:07:13.120> and<00:07:13.689> we'll

00:07:14.129 --> 00:07:14.139 
impacted that are out there and we'll

00:07:14.139 --> 00:07:18.089 
impacted that are out there and we'll
continue<00:07:14.439> to<00:07:14.800> have<00:07:15.219> the<00:07:15.400> lake<00:07:15.639> level<00:07:15.849> rise<00:07:17.099> up

00:07:18.089 --> 00:07:18.099 
continue to have the lake level rise up

00:07:18.099 --> 00:07:20.939 
continue to have the lake level rise up
up<00:07:18.639> to<00:07:18.969> about<00:07:19.210> a<00:07:19.270> foot<00:07:19.569> and<00:07:19.599> a<00:07:19.719> half<00:07:19.770> foot<00:07:20.770> and
