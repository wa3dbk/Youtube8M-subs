00:00:37.460 --> 00:00:37.470 
wood which like I said are in another

00:00:37.470 --> 00:00:39.920 
wood which like I said are in another
video<00:00:37.680> in<00:00:37.830> the<00:00:38.010> past<00:00:38.660> today<00:00:39.660> we're<00:00:39.809> actually

00:00:39.920 --> 00:00:39.930

gonna be talking about the new like
literal<00:00:42.330> blocks<00:00:42.600> which<00:00:43.170> include<00:00:43.650> these

00:00:43.790 --> 00:00:43.800 
literal blocks which include these

00:00:43.800 --> 00:00:45.920 
literal blocks which include these
different<00:00:44.190> types<00:00:44.220> of<00:00:44.550> stone<00:00:44.850> as<00:00:45.120> well<00:00:45.720> as

00:00:45.920 --> 00:00:45.930 
different types of stone as well as

different types of stone as well as
these<00:00:46.170> prisoner<00:00:46.589> iNOS<00:00:46.920> and<00:00:47.339> slime<00:00:48.120> blocks<00:00:48.390> so

00:00:48.469 --> 00:00:48.479 
these prisoner iNOS and slime blocks so

00:00:48.479 --> 00:00:49.579 
these prisoner iNOS and slime blocks so
let's<00:00:48.629> just<00:00:48.750> go<00:00:48.809> ahead<00:00:48.930> and<00:00:49.050> start<00:00:49.350> from<00:00:49.470> the

00:00:49.579 --> 00:00:49.589 
let's just go ahead and start from the

00:00:49.589 --> 00:00:52.280 
let's just go ahead and start from the
top<00:00:49.949> and<00:00:50.129> we'll<00:00:50.610> work<00:00:50.760> our<00:00:50.940> way<00:00:50.970> back<00:00:51.360> so<00:00:51.960> here

00:00:52.280 --> 00:00:52.290 
top and we'll work our way back so here

00:00:52.290 --> 00:00:53.930 
top and we'll work our way back so here
in<00:00:52.440> our<00:00:52.559> top<00:00:52.800> road<00:00:53.070> these<00:00:53.280> are<00:00:53.430> actually<00:00:53.790> all

00:00:53.930 --> 00:00:53.940 
in our top road these are actually all

00:00:53.940 --> 00:00:55.310 
in our top road these are actually all
of<00:00:54.150> the<00:00:54.239> different<00:00:54.600> blocks<00:00:54.839> that<00:00:54.989> we<00:00:55.080> will<00:00:55.199> be

00:00:55.310 --> 00:00:55.320 
of the different blocks that we will be

00:00:55.320 --> 00:00:57.500 
of the different blocks that we will be
getting<00:00:55.440> that<00:00:55.620> have<00:00:55.949> to<00:00:56.100> do<00:00:56.250> with<00:00:56.790> water<00:00:57.210> in

00:00:57.500 --> 00:00:57.510 
getting that have to do with water in

00:00:57.510 --> 00:01:00.560 
getting that have to do with water in
some<00:00:57.809> way<00:00:57.960> shape<00:00:57.989> or<00:00:58.440> form<00:00:58.500> so<00:00:59.220> about<00:00:59.610> probably

00:01:00.560 --> 00:01:00.570 
some way shape or form so about probably

00:01:00.570 --> 00:01:01.789 
some way shape or form so about probably
about<00:01:00.690> a<00:01:00.750> month<00:01:00.809> ago<00:01:01.080> now<00:01:01.350> when<00:01:01.530> I<00:01:01.559> made<00:01:01.769> that

00:01:01.789 --> 00:01:01.799 
about a month ago now when I made that

00:01:01.799 --> 00:01:03.799 
about a month ago now when I made that
video<00:01:02.040> on<00:01:02.370> the<00:01:02.400> ocean<00:01:02.820> monuments<00:01:03.330> you<00:01:03.690> guys

00:01:03.799 --> 00:01:03.809 
video on the ocean monuments you guys

00:01:03.809 --> 00:01:05.180 
video on the ocean monuments you guys
might<00:01:04.049> remember<00:01:04.080> that<00:01:04.470> they<00:01:04.680> were<00:01:04.769> actually

00:01:05.180 --> 00:01:05.190 
might remember that they were actually

00:01:05.190 --> 00:01:06.620 
might remember that they were actually
made<00:01:05.370> out<00:01:05.400> of<00:01:05.670> these<00:01:05.790> different<00:01:06.000> types<00:01:06.330> of<00:01:06.450> ore

00:01:06.620 --> 00:01:06.630 
made out of these different types of ore

00:01:06.630 --> 00:01:08.120 
made out of these different types of ore
which<00:01:06.840> are<00:01:06.990> actually<00:01:07.260> called<00:01:07.470> prism<00:01:07.830> marine

00:01:08.120 --> 00:01:08.130 
which are actually called prism marine

00:01:08.130 --> 00:01:10.070 
which are actually called prism marine
or<00:01:08.310> so<00:01:08.940> you<00:01:09.000> can<00:01:09.180> see<00:01:09.330> here<00:01:09.630> one<00:01:09.810> of<00:01:09.840> them<00:01:09.990> is

00:01:10.070 --> 00:01:10.080 
or so you can see here one of them is

00:01:10.080 --> 00:01:11.420 
or so you can see here one of them is
called<00:01:10.229> just<00:01:10.470> straight-up<00:01:10.710> prisoner<00:01:11.130> in<00:01:11.250> or

00:01:11.420 --> 00:01:11.430 
called just straight-up prisoner in or

00:01:11.430 --> 00:01:13.160 
called just straight-up prisoner in or
this<00:01:11.909> one<00:01:12.090> is<00:01:12.180> called<00:01:12.299> prism<00:01:12.600> erine<00:01:12.870> bricks

00:01:13.160 --> 00:01:13.170 
this one is called prism erine bricks

00:01:13.170 --> 00:01:14.660 
this one is called prism erine bricks
and<00:01:13.409> this<00:01:13.799> one<00:01:13.950> is<00:01:14.009> called<00:01:14.130> dark<00:01:14.460> prison

00:01:14.660 --> 00:01:14.670 
and this one is called dark prison

00:01:14.670 --> 00:01:15.950 
and this one is called dark prison
marine<00:01:14.939> and<00:01:15.090> then<00:01:15.180> you<00:01:15.270> get<00:01:15.420> these<00:01:15.570> different

00:01:15.950 --> 00:01:15.960 
marine and then you get these different

00:01:15.960 --> 00:01:17.149 
marine and then you get these different
blocks<00:01:16.170> that<00:01:16.320> allow<00:01:16.530> you<00:01:16.590> to<00:01:16.829> make<00:01:16.979> these

00:01:17.149 --> 00:01:17.159 
blocks that allow you to make these

00:01:17.159 --> 00:01:19.370 
blocks that allow you to make these
different<00:01:17.520> things<00:01:18.200> specifically<00:01:19.200> these

00:01:19.370 --> 00:01:19.380 
different things specifically these

00:01:19.380 --> 00:01:21.350 
different things specifically these
blocks<00:01:19.680> here<00:01:20.009> and<00:01:20.159> essentially<00:01:21.060> these<00:01:21.149> all

00:01:21.350 --> 00:01:21.360 
blocks here and essentially these all

00:01:21.360 --> 00:01:23.600 
blocks here and essentially these all
spot<00:01:21.659> out<00:01:21.869> in<00:01:22.020> the<00:01:22.140> ocean<00:01:22.350> monuments<00:01:23.100> and<00:01:23.219> you

00:01:23.600 --> 00:01:23.610 
spot out in the ocean monuments and you

00:01:23.610 --> 00:01:25.370 
spot out in the ocean monuments and you
can<00:01:23.759> mine<00:01:23.939> them<00:01:24.149> up<00:01:24.329> and<00:01:24.539> then<00:01:24.689> recraft<00:01:25.140> them

00:01:25.370 --> 00:01:25.380 
can mine them up and then recraft them

00:01:25.380 --> 00:01:26.810 
can mine them up and then recraft them
in<00:01:25.500> different<00:01:25.619> ways<00:01:25.950> to<00:01:26.009> get<00:01:26.340> like<00:01:26.520> I<00:01:26.609> said

00:01:26.810 --> 00:01:26.820 
in different ways to get like I said

00:01:26.820 --> 00:01:28.099 
in different ways to get like I said
these<00:01:26.939> different<00:01:27.299> types<00:01:27.329> of<00:01:27.600> blocks<00:01:27.810> here

00:01:28.099 --> 00:01:28.109 
these different types of blocks here

00:01:28.109 --> 00:01:30.679 
these different types of blocks here
here<00:01:28.859> is<00:01:29.039> actually<00:01:29.280> a<00:01:29.460> sea<00:01:29.609> lantern<00:01:30.359> which<00:01:30.570> is

00:01:30.679 --> 00:01:30.689 
here is actually a sea lantern which is

00:01:30.689 --> 00:01:32.539 
here is actually a sea lantern which is
essentially<00:01:31.289> just<00:01:31.439> a<00:01:31.740> piece<00:01:32.009> of<00:01:32.039> underwater

00:01:32.539 --> 00:01:32.549 
essentially just a piece of underwater

00:01:32.549 --> 00:01:35.090 
essentially just a piece of underwater
glowstone<00:01:33.180> that<00:01:33.689> obviously<00:01:34.079> works<00:01:34.409> on<00:01:34.619> on

00:01:35.090 --> 00:01:35.100 
glowstone that obviously works on on

00:01:35.100 --> 00:01:37.550 
glowstone that obviously works on on
land<00:01:35.430> so<00:01:35.759> this<00:01:36.210> is<00:01:36.359> also<00:01:36.570> found<00:01:36.930> in<00:01:37.140> the<00:01:37.259> ocean

00:01:37.550 --> 00:01:37.560 
land so this is also found in the ocean

00:01:37.560 --> 00:01:38.870 
land so this is also found in the ocean
monuments<00:01:38.070> and<00:01:38.189> this<00:01:38.280> is<00:01:38.399> like<00:01:38.579> I<00:01:38.670> said

00:01:38.870 --> 00:01:38.880 
monuments and this is like I said

00:01:38.880 --> 00:01:40.910 
monuments and this is like I said
glowstone<00:01:39.270> so<00:01:39.390> if<00:01:39.450> I<00:01:39.509> go<00:01:39.539> ahead<00:01:39.780> and<00:01:40.049> I<00:01:40.439> go<00:01:40.590> time

00:01:40.910 --> 00:01:40.920 
glowstone so if I go ahead and I go time

00:01:40.920 --> 00:01:43.429 
glowstone so if I go ahead and I go time
set<00:01:41.670> night<00:01:42.179> you<00:01:42.750> can<00:01:42.960> see<00:01:43.170> here<00:01:43.409> that

00:01:43.429 --> 00:01:43.439 
set night you can see here that

00:01:43.439 --> 00:01:44.990 
set night you can see here that
obviously<00:01:43.890> it's<00:01:44.039> giving<00:01:44.310> off<00:01:44.399> a<00:01:44.460> fair<00:01:44.820> bit<00:01:44.939> of

00:01:44.990 --> 00:01:45.000 
obviously it's giving off a fair bit of

00:01:45.000 --> 00:01:47.179 
obviously it's giving off a fair bit of
light<00:01:45.240> here<00:01:45.750> from<00:01:46.049> it<00:01:46.170> just<00:01:46.200> like<00:01:46.500> glow<00:01:46.920> stone

00:01:47.179 --> 00:01:47.189 
light here from it just like glow stone

00:01:47.189 --> 00:01:49.999 
light here from it just like glow stone
wood<00:01:47.429> so<00:01:48.060> that<00:01:48.090> is<00:01:48.630> what<00:01:48.960> those<00:01:49.140> two<00:01:49.409> are<00:01:49.439> here

00:01:49.999 --> 00:01:50.009 
wood so that is what those two are here

00:01:50.009 --> 00:01:51.679 
wood so that is what those two are here
obviously<00:01:50.159> on<00:01:50.490> the<00:01:50.579> sides<00:01:50.789> we<00:01:51.030> have<00:01:51.270> different

00:01:51.679 --> 00:01:51.689 
obviously on the sides we have different

00:01:51.689 --> 00:01:53.660 
obviously on the sides we have different
sponges<00:01:52.200> I<00:01:52.350> will<00:01:52.740> see<00:01:52.859> this<00:01:52.979> is<00:01:53.070> a<00:01:53.100> dry<00:01:53.399> sponge

00:01:53.660 --> 00:01:53.670 
sponges I will see this is a dry sponge

00:01:53.670 --> 00:01:55.489 
sponges I will see this is a dry sponge
this<00:01:53.909> is<00:01:53.999> a<00:01:54.119> wet<00:01:54.299> sponge<00:01:54.570> and<00:01:54.810> essentially

00:01:55.489 --> 00:01:55.499 
this is a wet sponge and essentially

00:01:55.499 --> 00:01:57.080 
this is a wet sponge and essentially
what<00:01:55.530> these<00:01:55.799> do<00:01:55.979> is<00:01:56.009> they<00:01:56.249> just<00:01:56.429> soak<00:01:56.670> up<00:01:56.850> water

00:01:57.080 --> 00:01:57.090 
what these do is they just soak up water

00:01:57.090 --> 00:01:59.179 
what these do is they just soak up water
and<00:01:57.450> that's<00:01:58.409> why<00:01:58.530> they're<00:01:58.679> in<00:01:58.710> this<00:01:58.890> area<00:01:59.130> is

00:01:59.179 --> 00:01:59.189 
and that's why they're in this area is

00:01:59.189 --> 00:02:00.709 
and that's why they're in this area is
because<00:01:59.399> they<00:01:59.490> have<00:01:59.759> to<00:02:00.090> do<00:02:00.179> with<00:02:00.299> water<00:02:00.509> so

00:02:00.709 --> 00:02:00.719 
because they have to do with water so

00:02:00.719 --> 00:02:01.999 
because they have to do with water so
you<00:02:00.810> can<00:02:00.990> see<00:02:01.140> here<00:02:01.320> if<00:02:01.380> I<00:02:01.439> actually<00:02:01.530> put<00:02:01.770> water

00:02:01.999 --> 00:02:02.009 
you can see here if I actually put water

00:02:02.009 --> 00:02:04.010 
you can see here if I actually put water
around<00:02:02.670> this<00:02:02.880> it<00:02:03.060> will<00:02:03.149> suck<00:02:03.420> up<00:02:03.450> the<00:02:03.659> water<00:02:03.689> on

00:02:04.010 --> 00:02:04.020 
around this it will suck up the water on

00:02:04.020 --> 00:02:05.389 
around this it will suck up the water on
this<00:02:04.170> side<00:02:04.350> but<00:02:04.499> not<00:02:04.649> on<00:02:04.770> the<00:02:04.859> other<00:02:05.039> side<00:02:05.249> and

00:02:05.389 --> 00:02:05.399 
this side but not on the other side and

00:02:05.399 --> 00:02:06.950 
this side but not on the other side and
if<00:02:05.520> I<00:02:05.549> put<00:02:05.729> it<00:02:05.819> right<00:02:05.850> next<00:02:06.090> to<00:02:06.270> it<00:02:06.299> it'll<00:02:06.929> just

00:02:06.950 --> 00:02:06.960 
if I put it right next to it it'll just

00:02:06.960 --> 00:02:08.419 
if I put it right next to it it'll just
suck<00:02:07.289> up<00:02:07.439> all<00:02:07.560> the<00:02:07.619> water<00:02:07.799> on<00:02:07.920> this<00:02:08.130> side<00:02:08.310> and

00:02:08.419 --> 00:02:08.429 
suck up all the water on this side and

00:02:08.429 --> 00:02:09.620 
suck up all the water on this side and
now<00:02:08.520> you<00:02:08.580> can<00:02:08.759> see<00:02:08.880> it's<00:02:09.000> actually<00:02:09.300> a<00:02:09.330> full

00:02:09.620 --> 00:02:09.630 
now you can see it's actually a full

00:02:09.630 --> 00:02:12.020 
now you can see it's actually a full
block<00:02:09.869> so<00:02:10.470> if<00:02:10.560> I<00:02:10.649> grab<00:02:10.890> just<00:02:11.190> a<00:02:11.370> normal<00:02:11.640> sponge

00:02:12.020 --> 00:02:12.030 
block so if I grab just a normal sponge

00:02:12.030 --> 00:02:16.040 
block so if I grab just a normal sponge
here<00:02:12.330> a<00:02:12.740> dry<00:02:13.740> sponge<00:02:14.100> and<00:02:14.400> I<00:02:15.210> place<00:02:15.630> it<00:02:15.840> down

00:02:16.040 --> 00:02:16.050 
here a dry sponge and I place it down

00:02:16.050 --> 00:02:17.660 
here a dry sponge and I place it down
you<00:02:16.380> can<00:02:16.530> see<00:02:16.560> it<00:02:16.770> actually<00:02:16.860> sucks<00:02:17.310> up<00:02:17.460> all<00:02:17.610> the

00:02:17.660 --> 00:02:17.670 
you can see it actually sucks up all the

00:02:17.670 --> 00:02:19.790 
you can see it actually sucks up all the
water<00:02:17.940> in<00:02:18.240> the<00:02:18.360> area<00:02:18.510> so<00:02:19.140> if<00:02:19.200> I<00:02:19.260> put<00:02:19.440> it<00:02:19.650> right

00:02:19.790 --> 00:02:19.800 
water in the area so if I put it right

00:02:19.800 --> 00:02:21.620 
water in the area so if I put it right
here<00:02:19.860> open<00:02:20.490> I<00:02:20.550> right<00:02:20.700> there<00:02:20.850> right<00:02:21.240> here<00:02:21.510> you

00:02:21.620 --> 00:02:21.630 
here open I right there right here you

00:02:21.630 --> 00:02:22.730 
here open I right there right here you
can<00:02:21.780> see<00:02:21.900> it<00:02:21.990> just<00:02:22.080> sucks<00:02:22.320> up<00:02:22.440> all<00:02:22.530> the<00:02:22.590> water

00:02:22.730 --> 00:02:22.740 
can see it just sucks up all the water

00:02:22.740 --> 00:02:23.510 
can see it just sucks up all the water
in<00:02:22.980> there

00:02:23.510 --> 00:02:23.520 
in there

00:02:23.520 --> 00:02:24.710 
in there
I<00:02:23.580> put<00:02:23.850> it<00:02:23.940> here<00:02:24.120> just<00:02:24.240> sucks<00:02:24.480> up<00:02:24.570> all<00:02:24.660> the

00:02:24.710 --> 00:02:24.720 
I put it here just sucks up all the

00:02:24.720 --> 00:02:26.360 
I put it here just sucks up all the
water<00:02:24.870> there<00:02:25.200> and<00:02:25.440> it's<00:02:25.770> just<00:02:25.920> really<00:02:26.040> kind<00:02:26.250> of

00:02:26.360 --> 00:02:26.370 
water there and it's just really kind of

00:02:26.370 --> 00:02:27.830 
water there and it's just really kind of
a<00:02:26.460> cool<00:02:26.640> new<00:02:26.910> block<00:02:27.150> fit<00:02:27.390> tab<00:02:27.630> that<00:02:27.720> we've

00:02:27.830 --> 00:02:27.840 
a cool new block fit tab that we've

00:02:27.840 --> 00:02:29.420 
a cool new block fit tab that we've
never<00:02:27.960> seen<00:02:28.080> anything<00:02:28.470> like<00:02:28.590> on<00:02:28.890> the<00:02:29.040> console

00:02:29.420 --> 00:02:29.430 
never seen anything like on the console

00:02:29.430 --> 00:02:31.160 
never seen anything like on the console
anyway<00:02:30.150> and<00:02:30.330> it<00:02:30.390> just<00:02:30.540> allows<00:02:30.750> you<00:02:30.900> to<00:02:31.020> very

00:02:31.160 --> 00:02:31.170 
anyway and it just allows you to very

00:02:31.170 --> 00:02:32.750 
anyway and it just allows you to very
quickly<00:02:31.470> and<00:02:31.740> effectively<00:02:31.920> clean<00:02:32.340> up<00:02:32.520> water

00:02:32.750 --> 00:02:32.760 
quickly and effectively clean up water

00:02:32.760 --> 00:02:34.790 
quickly and effectively clean up water
now<00:02:33.330> if<00:02:33.480> I<00:02:33.540> was<00:02:33.690> on<00:02:33.720> survival<00:02:34.500> mode<00:02:34.620> and<00:02:34.770> I

00:02:34.790 --> 00:02:34.800 
now if I was on survival mode and I

00:02:34.800 --> 00:02:36.020 
now if I was on survival mode and I
broke<00:02:35.010> this<00:02:35.190> it<00:02:35.370> would<00:02:35.460> actually<00:02:35.550> release<00:02:35.910> the

00:02:36.020 --> 00:02:36.030 
broke this it would actually release the

00:02:36.030 --> 00:02:37.100 
broke this it would actually release the
water<00:02:36.180> but<00:02:36.360> obviously<00:02:36.750> since<00:02:36.960> I'm<00:02:37.050> in

00:02:37.100 --> 00:02:37.110 
water but obviously since I'm in

00:02:37.110 --> 00:02:38.780 
water but obviously since I'm in
creative<00:02:37.500> mode<00:02:37.530> if<00:02:37.830> I<00:02:38.130> break<00:02:38.370> it<00:02:38.550> up<00:02:38.640> it<00:02:38.760> just

00:02:38.780 --> 00:02:38.790 
creative mode if I break it up it just

00:02:38.790 --> 00:02:40.970 
creative mode if I break it up it just
goes<00:02:39.090> away<00:02:39.270> no<00:02:39.930> problemo<00:02:40.380> so<00:02:40.740> those<00:02:40.950> are

00:02:40.970 --> 00:02:40.980 
goes away no problemo so those are

00:02:40.980 --> 00:02:43.640 
goes away no problemo so those are
sponges<00:02:41.870> now<00:02:42.870> moving<00:02:43.140> on<00:02:43.260> to<00:02:43.290> the<00:02:43.410> type<00:02:43.620> of

00:02:43.640 --> 00:02:43.650 
sponges now moving on to the type of

00:02:43.650 --> 00:02:45.080 
sponges now moving on to the type of
oars<00:02:43.890> that<00:02:44.070> I<00:02:44.100> can<00:02:44.370> not<00:02:44.520> pronounce<00:02:44.670> I'm<00:02:44.970> just

00:02:45.080 --> 00:02:45.090 
oars that I can not pronounce I'm just

00:02:45.090 --> 00:02:46.640 
oars that I can not pronounce I'm just
go<00:02:45.150> ahead<00:02:45.330> and<00:02:45.420> show<00:02:45.600> you<00:02:45.630> here<00:02:46.290> you<00:02:46.440> can<00:02:46.590> see

00:02:46.640 --> 00:02:46.650 
go ahead and show you here you can see

00:02:46.650 --> 00:02:47.900 
go ahead and show you here you can see
we<00:02:46.920> have<00:02:46.950> all<00:02:47.220> I<00:02:47.280> guess<00:02:47.430> the<00:02:47.520> one<00:02:47.640> I<00:02:47.670> can't

00:02:47.900 --> 00:02:47.910 
we have all I guess the one I can't

00:02:47.910 --> 00:02:50.120 
we have all I guess the one I can't
pronounce<00:02:48.060> is<00:02:48.390> granite<00:02:48.780> so<00:02:49.320> here<00:02:49.650> is<00:02:49.800> granite

00:02:50.120 --> 00:02:50.130 
pronounce is granite so here is granite

is how you say that and these are just

00:03:03.660 --> 00:03:05.270 
is how you say that and these are just
the<00:03:03.780> three<00:03:04.050> new<00:03:04.170> types<00:03:04.410> of<00:03:04.560> rock<00:03:04.830> that<00:03:04.860> will<00:03:05.190> be

00:03:05.270 --> 00:03:05.280 
the three new types of rock that will be

00:03:05.280 --> 00:03:06.950 
the three new types of rock that will be
naturally<00:03:05.730> spawning<00:03:06.090> in<00:03:06.210> the<00:03:06.240> world<00:03:06.480> from

00:03:06.950 --> 00:03:06.960 
naturally spawning in the world from

00:03:06.960 --> 00:03:08.330 
naturally spawning in the world from
what<00:03:07.170> I've<00:03:07.290> read<00:03:07.470> in<00:03:07.530> from<00:03:07.770> what<00:03:07.890> I've<00:03:07.980> seen<00:03:08.010> in

00:03:08.330 --> 00:03:08.340 
what I've read in from what I've seen in

00:03:08.340 --> 00:03:10.130 
what I've read in from what I've seen in
the<00:03:08.370> past<00:03:08.610> these<00:03:08.850> actually<00:03:09.270> will<00:03:09.420> spawn<00:03:09.750> kind

00:03:10.130 --> 00:03:10.140 
the past these actually will spawn kind

00:03:10.140 --> 00:03:12.350 
the past these actually will spawn kind
of<00:03:10.290> like<00:03:10.440> gravel<00:03:10.860> does<00:03:11.040> underground<00:03:11.970> in<00:03:12.210> like

00:03:12.350 --> 00:03:12.360 
of like gravel does underground in like

00:03:12.360 --> 00:03:14.180 
of like gravel does underground in like
little<00:03:12.630> patches<00:03:13.110> and<00:03:13.290> streams<00:03:13.680> of<00:03:13.860> them<00:03:14.010> and

00:03:14.180 --> 00:03:14.190 
little patches and streams of them and

00:03:14.190 --> 00:03:15.920 
little patches and streams of them and
so<00:03:14.550> you'll<00:03:14.700> find<00:03:14.910> them<00:03:15.060> kind<00:03:15.330> of<00:03:15.450> in<00:03:15.540> bulk<00:03:15.780> in

00:03:15.920 --> 00:03:15.930 
so you'll find them kind of in bulk in

00:03:15.930 --> 00:03:17.450 
so you'll find them kind of in bulk in
different<00:03:16.230> areas<00:03:16.560> and<00:03:16.740> what<00:03:17.160> you're<00:03:17.280> going<00:03:17.370> to

00:03:17.450 --> 00:03:17.460 
different areas and what you're going to

00:03:17.460 --> 00:03:19.700 
different areas and what you're going to
find<00:03:17.520> is<00:03:18.030> this<00:03:18.330> kind<00:03:18.630> this<00:03:18.990> right<00:03:19.500> here<00:03:19.680> this

00:03:19.700 --> 00:03:19.710 
find is this kind this right here this

00:03:19.710 --> 00:03:22.010 
find is this kind this right here this
non<00:03:20.010> polished<00:03:20.460> version<00:03:20.640> of<00:03:20.940> each<00:03:21.480> one<00:03:21.720> so<00:03:21.900> the

00:03:22.010 --> 00:03:22.020 
non polished version of each one so the

00:03:22.020 --> 00:03:23.960 
non polished version of each one so the
non<00:03:22.200> polish<00:03:22.530> granted<00:03:22.920> the<00:03:23.010> non<00:03:23.160> polish<00:03:23.580> didn't

00:03:23.960 --> 00:03:23.970 
non polish granted the non polish didn't

00:03:23.970 --> 00:03:26.210 
non polish granted the non polish didn't
are<00:03:24.180> right<00:03:24.450> and<00:03:24.720> then<00:03:25.170> the<00:03:25.260> non<00:03:25.440> polished<00:03:26.010> and

00:03:26.210 --> 00:03:26.220 
are right and then the non polished and

00:03:26.220 --> 00:03:28.160 
are right and then the non polished and
so<00:03:26.610> whatever<00:03:26.820> and<00:03:27.180> that's<00:03:27.570> these<00:03:27.840> guys<00:03:28.020> right

00:03:28.160 --> 00:03:28.170 
so whatever and that's these guys right

00:03:28.170 --> 00:03:29.360 
so whatever and that's these guys right
here<00:03:28.230> on<00:03:28.470> the<00:03:28.560> left<00:03:28.800> the<00:03:28.920> ones<00:03:29.070> that<00:03:29.220> don't

00:03:29.360 --> 00:03:29.370 
here on the left the ones that don't

00:03:29.370 --> 00:03:30.949 
here on the left the ones that don't
look<00:03:29.520> pretty<00:03:29.790> and<00:03:30.000> then<00:03:30.420> if<00:03:30.540> you<00:03:30.630> put<00:03:30.810> them

00:03:30.949 --> 00:03:30.959 
look pretty and then if you put them

00:03:30.959 --> 00:03:32.900 
look pretty and then if you put them
into<00:03:31.110> a<00:03:31.230> crafting<00:03:31.709> table<00:03:31.740> into<00:03:32.340> a<00:03:32.370> recipe<00:03:32.880> that

00:03:32.900 --> 00:03:32.910 
into a crafting table into a recipe that

00:03:32.910 --> 00:03:34.699 
into a crafting table into a recipe that
looks<00:03:33.060> similar<00:03:33.570> to<00:03:33.900> this<00:03:33.930> just<00:03:34.380> a<00:03:34.440> moment<00:03:34.680> I

00:03:34.699 --> 00:03:34.709 
looks similar to this just a moment I

00:03:34.709 --> 00:03:37.220 
looks similar to this just a moment I
can<00:03:34.860> show<00:03:35.010> you<00:03:35.510> go<00:03:36.510> and<00:03:36.660> grab<00:03:36.750> a<00:03:36.810> crafting

00:03:37.220 --> 00:03:37.230 
can show you go and grab a crafting

00:03:37.230 --> 00:03:40.640 
can show you go and grab a crafting
table<00:03:37.880> you<00:03:38.880> can<00:03:39.090> very<00:03:39.390> simply<00:03:39.690> just<00:03:40.440> place

00:03:40.640 --> 00:03:40.650 
table you can very simply just place

00:03:40.650 --> 00:03:42.920 
table you can very simply just place
them<00:03:40.800> in<00:03:40.950> here<00:03:41.130> like<00:03:41.310> so<00:03:41.610> and<00:03:41.910> then<00:03:42.660> you<00:03:42.750> can

00:03:42.920 --> 00:03:42.930 
them in here like so and then you can

00:03:42.930 --> 00:03:44.360 
them in here like so and then you can
get<00:03:43.080> out<00:03:43.170> the<00:03:43.290> polished<00:03:43.709> version<00:03:43.830> just<00:03:44.190> like

00:03:44.360 --> 00:03:44.370 
get out the polished version just like

00:03:44.370 --> 00:03:46.250 
get out the polished version just like
that<00:03:44.580> super<00:03:45.270> simple<00:03:45.420> super<00:03:45.690> cool<00:03:45.990> and<00:03:46.020> it

00:03:46.250 --> 00:03:46.260 
that super simple super cool and it

00:03:46.260 --> 00:03:48.260 
that super simple super cool and it
really<00:03:46.410> adds<00:03:46.680> a<00:03:47.130> new<00:03:47.490> building<00:03:47.850> block<00:03:48.030> into

00:03:48.260 --> 00:03:48.270 
really adds a new building block into

00:03:48.270 --> 00:03:50.000 
really adds a new building block into
the<00:03:48.360> game<00:03:48.540> or<00:03:48.690> I<00:03:48.720> guess<00:03:48.959> six<00:03:49.560> new<00:03:49.709> building

00:03:50.000 --> 00:03:50.010 
the game or I guess six new building

00:03:50.010 --> 00:03:51.650 
the game or I guess six new building
blocks<00:03:50.220> into<00:03:50.400> the<00:03:50.550> game<00:03:50.700> in<00:03:50.820> particular<00:03:51.270> that

00:03:51.650 --> 00:03:51.660 
blocks into the game in particular that

00:03:51.660 --> 00:03:52.910 
blocks into the game in particular that
will<00:03:51.840> really<00:03:52.050> allow<00:03:52.200> you<00:03:52.350> to<00:03:52.560> add<00:03:52.680> some

00:03:52.910 --> 00:03:52.920 
will really allow you to add some

00:03:52.920 --> 00:03:54.590 
will really allow you to add some
variety<00:03:53.070> and<00:03:53.550> difference<00:03:53.970> to<00:03:54.209> your<00:03:54.360> houses

00:03:54.590 --> 00:03:54.600 
variety and difference to your houses

00:03:54.600 --> 00:03:57.170 
variety and difference to your houses
and<00:03:54.930> homes<00:03:55.140> when<00:03:55.740> it<00:03:55.830> is<00:03:55.980> released<00:03:56.220> now<00:03:57.030> my

00:03:57.170 --> 00:03:57.180 
and homes when it is released now my

00:03:57.180 --> 00:03:58.610 
and homes when it is released now my
personal<00:03:57.600> favorite<00:03:57.959> and<00:03:58.050> the<00:03:58.140> one<00:03:58.380> that<00:03:58.500> I'm

00:03:58.610 --> 00:03:58.620 
personal favorite and the one that I'm

00:03:58.620 --> 00:04:00.410 
personal favorite and the one that I'm
looking<00:03:58.800> most<00:03:59.100> forward<00:03:59.190> to<00:03:59.520> is<00:03:59.700> actually<00:04:00.270> the

00:04:00.410 --> 00:04:00.420 
looking most forward to is actually the

00:04:00.420 --> 00:04:02.420 
looking most forward to is actually the
slime<00:04:00.810> block<00:04:01.080> so<00:04:01.620> here<00:04:01.770> you<00:04:01.890> can<00:04:01.920> see<00:04:02.160> I<00:04:02.190> just

00:04:02.420 --> 00:04:02.430 
slime block so here you can see I just

00:04:02.430 --> 00:04:03.830 
slime block so here you can see I just
have<00:04:02.550> six<00:04:02.820> song<00:04:03.000> bucks<00:04:03.270> in<00:04:03.420> a<00:04:03.480> row<00:04:03.600> here

00:04:03.830 --> 00:04:03.840 
have six song bucks in a row here

00:04:03.840 --> 00:04:05.120 
have six song bucks in a row here
there's<00:04:04.020> no<00:04:04.140> reason<00:04:04.410> to<00:04:04.440> have<00:04:04.590> six<00:04:04.860> I<00:04:04.950> just

00:04:05.120 --> 00:04:05.130 
there's no reason to have six I just

00:04:05.130 --> 00:04:06.500 
there's no reason to have six I just
have<00:04:05.220> been<00:04:05.370> there<00:04:05.550> because<00:04:05.940> that's<00:04:06.209> how<00:04:06.360> many

00:04:06.500 --> 00:04:06.510 
have been there because that's how many

00:04:06.510 --> 00:04:08.060 
have been there because that's how many
of<00:04:06.630> each<00:04:06.720> other<00:04:06.990> block<00:04:07.230> I<00:04:07.380> had<00:04:07.560> so<00:04:07.740> it<00:04:07.830> kind<00:04:08.010> of

00:04:08.060 --> 00:04:08.070 
of each other block I had so it kind of

00:04:08.070 --> 00:04:10.100 
of each other block I had so it kind of
works<00:04:08.640> with<00:04:08.820> the<00:04:08.880> thing<00:04:09.060> and<00:04:09.209> slime<00:04:09.870> blocks

00:04:10.100 --> 00:04:10.110 
works with the thing and slime blocks

00:04:10.110 --> 00:04:11.480 
works with the thing and slime blocks
really<00:04:10.560> have<00:04:10.800> a<00:04:10.830> whole<00:04:11.160> bunch<00:04:11.280> of<00:04:11.430> different

00:04:11.480 --> 00:04:11.490 
really have a whole bunch of different

00:04:11.490 --> 00:04:14.060 
really have a whole bunch of different
uses<00:04:11.820> especially<00:04:12.450> in<00:04:12.540> red<00:04:12.720> stone<00:04:13.010> they<00:04:14.010> do

00:04:14.060 --> 00:04:14.070 
uses especially in red stone they do

00:04:14.070 --> 00:04:15.470 
uses especially in red stone they do
some<00:04:14.310> pretty<00:04:14.340> nifty<00:04:14.670> things<00:04:14.970> with<00:04:15.090> pistons

00:04:15.470 --> 00:04:15.480 
some pretty nifty things with pistons

00:04:15.480 --> 00:04:17.539 
some pretty nifty things with pistons
and<00:04:15.570> have<00:04:16.500> cool<00:04:16.739> different<00:04:17.010> features<00:04:17.250> to<00:04:17.400> them

00:04:17.539 --> 00:04:17.549 
and have cool different features to them

00:04:17.549 --> 00:04:18.830 
and have cool different features to them
I'm<00:04:17.700> not<00:04:18.120> going<00:04:18.239> to<00:04:18.299> talk<00:04:18.390> about<00:04:18.540> them<00:04:18.720> too

00:04:18.830 --> 00:04:18.840 
I'm not going to talk about them too

00:04:18.840 --> 00:04:20.330 
I'm not going to talk about them too
much<00:04:18.959> in<00:04:19.109> this<00:04:19.169> video<00:04:19.440> because<00:04:19.890> I<00:04:20.040> think

00:04:20.330 --> 00:04:20.340 
much in this video because I think

00:04:20.340 --> 00:04:21.590 
much in this video because I think
that's<00:04:20.489> probably<00:04:20.640> a<00:04:20.820> video<00:04:21.090> in<00:04:21.270> and<00:04:21.419> of<00:04:21.480> itself

00:04:21.590 --> 00:04:21.600 
that's probably a video in and of itself

00:04:21.600 --> 00:04:23.510 
that's probably a video in and of itself
if<00:04:22.140> you<00:04:22.320> guys<00:04:22.440> want<00:04:22.680> to<00:04:22.770> see<00:04:22.860> a<00:04:22.890> video<00:04:23.100> fully

00:04:23.510 --> 00:04:23.520 
if you guys want to see a video fully

00:04:23.520 --> 00:04:24.620 
if you guys want to see a video fully
explaining<00:04:24.000> the<00:04:24.090> different<00:04:24.360> things<00:04:24.510> that<00:04:24.540> you

00:04:24.620 --> 00:04:24.630 
explaining the different things that you

00:04:24.630 --> 00:04:26.120 
explaining the different things that you
could<00:04:24.780> do<00:04:24.840> with<00:04:24.930> a<00:04:25.020> slime<00:04:25.320> block<00:04:25.530> feel<00:04:25.950> free<00:04:26.070> to

00:04:26.120 --> 00:04:26.130 
could do with a slime block feel free to

00:04:26.130 --> 00:04:27.650 
could do with a slime block feel free to
drop<00:04:26.280> that<00:04:26.460> down<00:04:26.610> into<00:04:26.910> the<00:04:27.030> comment<00:04:27.390> section

00:04:27.650 --> 00:04:27.660 
drop that down into the comment section

00:04:27.660 --> 00:04:29.540 
drop that down into the comment section
below<00:04:27.780> but<00:04:28.410> it<00:04:28.530> is<00:04:28.650> worth<00:04:28.800> noting<00:04:29.070> that<00:04:29.250> when

00:04:29.540 --> 00:04:29.550 
below but it is worth noting that when

00:04:29.550 --> 00:04:31.610 
below but it is worth noting that when
1.8<00:04:30.419> was<00:04:30.570> released<00:04:30.900> on<00:04:31.050> the<00:04:31.169> pc<00:04:31.440> this<00:04:31.560> was

00:04:31.610 --> 00:04:31.620 
1.8 was released on the pc this was

00:04:31.620 --> 00:04:33.230 
1.8 was released on the pc this was
released<00:04:32.040> with<00:04:32.190> it<00:04:32.340> and<00:04:32.490> probably<00:04:32.850> my<00:04:33.090> most

00:04:33.230 --> 00:04:33.240 
released with it and probably my most

00:04:33.240 --> 00:04:34.580 
released with it and probably my most
favorite<00:04:33.630> feature<00:04:33.840> that<00:04:34.080> came<00:04:34.260> with<00:04:34.470> the

00:04:34.580 --> 00:04:34.590 
favorite feature that came with the

00:04:34.590 --> 00:04:36.560 
favorite feature that came with the
slime<00:04:34.800> block<00:04:35.040> is<00:04:35.220> actually<00:04:35.940> this<00:04:36.180> right<00:04:36.419> here

00:04:36.560 --> 00:04:36.570 
slime block is actually this right here

00:04:36.570 --> 00:04:37.190 
slime block is actually this right here
so<00:04:36.720> i<00:04:36.750> fly

00:04:37.190 --> 00:04:37.200 
so i fly

00:04:37.200 --> 00:04:38.600 
so i fly
up<00:04:37.260> in<00:04:37.380> the<00:04:37.470> area<00:04:37.560> I<00:04:37.710> land<00:04:37.950> on<00:04:38.070> it<00:04:38.190> you<00:04:38.250> can<00:04:38.430> see

00:04:38.600 --> 00:04:38.610 
up in the area I land on it you can see

00:04:38.610 --> 00:04:40.880 
up in the area I land on it you can see
I<00:04:38.820> now<00:04:39.330> bounce<00:04:39.660> up<00:04:39.930> in<00:04:40.050> the<00:04:40.140> air<00:04:40.290> and<00:04:40.590> I<00:04:40.650> would

00:04:40.880 --> 00:04:40.890 
I now bounce up in the air and I would

00:04:40.890 --> 00:04:42.830 
I now bounce up in the air and I would
take<00:04:41.100> no<00:04:41.250> fall<00:04:41.460> damage<00:04:41.850> if<00:04:41.970> I<00:04:42.330> were<00:04:42.450> to<00:04:42.570> land<00:04:42.690> on

00:04:42.830 --> 00:04:42.840 
take no fall damage if I were to land on

00:04:42.840 --> 00:04:44.120 
take no fall damage if I were to land on
this<00:04:42.990> in<00:04:43.140> survival<00:04:43.530> mode<00:04:43.560> and<00:04:43.830> it's<00:04:43.950> really

00:04:44.120 --> 00:04:44.130 
this in survival mode and it's really

00:04:44.130 --> 00:04:46.280 
this in survival mode and it's really
just<00:04:44.340> kind<00:04:44.610> of<00:04:44.640> a<00:04:44.730> cool<00:04:44.880> block<00:04:45.180> overall<00:04:46.020> and

00:04:46.280 --> 00:04:46.290 
just kind of a cool block overall and

00:04:46.290 --> 00:04:47.300 
just kind of a cool block overall and
I'm<00:04:46.380> really<00:04:46.530> kind<00:04:46.740> of<00:04:46.800> excited<00:04:47.100> for<00:04:47.190> it<00:04:47.250> to

00:04:47.300 --> 00:04:47.310 
I'm really kind of excited for it to

00:04:47.310 --> 00:04:48.500 
I'm really kind of excited for it to
come<00:04:47.400> out<00:04:47.490> like<00:04:47.550> I<00:04:47.730> said<00:04:47.910> it<00:04:48.030> has<00:04:48.150> some<00:04:48.330> cool

00:04:48.500 --> 00:04:48.510 
come out like I said it has some cool

00:04:48.510 --> 00:04:50.810 
come out like I said it has some cool
implications<00:04:49.140> that<00:04:49.320> you<00:04:49.710> can<00:04:49.890> use<00:04:50.040> with<00:04:50.340> some

00:04:50.810 --> 00:04:50.820 
implications that you can use with some

00:04:50.820 --> 00:04:53.930 
implications that you can use with some
redstone<00:04:51.350> so<00:04:52.350> as<00:04:52.470> far<00:04:52.650> as<00:04:52.710> blocks<00:04:53.100> go<00:04:53.310> that<00:04:53.790> is

00:04:53.930 --> 00:04:53.940 
redstone so as far as blocks go that is

00:04:53.940 --> 00:04:55.190 
redstone so as far as blocks go that is
all<00:04:54.120> of<00:04:54.270> the<00:04:54.360> new<00:04:54.510> ones<00:04:54.690> that<00:04:54.810> we<00:04:54.900> will<00:04:55.050> be

00:04:55.190 --> 00:04:55.200 
all of the new ones that we will be

00:04:55.200 --> 00:04:56.930 
all of the new ones that we will be
seeing<00:04:55.380> in<00:04:55.560> the<00:04:55.680> next<00:04:55.920> big<00:04:56.100> update<00:04:56.400> for<00:04:56.580> likely

00:04:56.930 --> 00:04:56.940 
seeing in the next big update for likely

00:04:56.940 --> 00:04:58.850 
seeing in the next big update for likely
on<00:04:57.060> minecraft<00:04:57.510> on<00:04:57.600> the<00:04:57.750> console<00:04:58.080> this<00:04:58.500> has<00:04:58.710> not

00:04:58.850 --> 00:04:58.860 
on minecraft on the console this has not

00:04:58.860 --> 00:05:00.530 
on minecraft on the console this has not
yet<00:04:59.040> been<00:04:59.220> confirmed<00:04:59.430> but<00:04:59.910> if<00:05:00.030> it<00:05:00.150> makes<00:05:00.330> sense

00:05:00.530 --> 00:05:00.540 
yet been confirmed but if it makes sense

00:05:00.540 --> 00:05:01.730 
yet been confirmed but if it makes sense
that<00:05:00.660> if<00:05:00.810> we<00:05:00.900> look<00:05:01.020> at<00:05:01.110> the<00:05:01.260> history<00:05:01.560> of

00:05:01.730 --> 00:05:01.740 
that if we look at the history of

00:05:01.740 --> 00:05:03.860 
that if we look at the history of
Minecraft<00:05:02.490> on<00:05:02.610> the<00:05:02.730> pc<00:05:03.090> and<00:05:03.120> minecraft<00:05:03.690> for

00:05:03.860 --> 00:05:03.870 
Minecraft on the pc and minecraft for

00:05:03.870 --> 00:05:05.600 
Minecraft on the pc and minecraft for
the<00:05:03.900> xbox<00:05:03.990> it<00:05:04.500> would<00:05:04.620> only<00:05:04.710> make<00:05:04.950> sense<00:05:04.980> that

00:05:05.600 --> 00:05:05.610 
the xbox it would only make sense that

00:05:05.610 --> 00:05:06.950 
the xbox it would only make sense that
in<00:05:05.700> the<00:05:05.790> next<00:05:05.910> big<00:05:06.150> update<00:05:06.450> we<00:05:06.570> will<00:05:06.660> be<00:05:06.750> seeing

00:05:06.950 --> 00:05:06.960 
in the next big update we will be seeing

00:05:06.960 --> 00:05:08.930 
in the next big update we will be seeing
those<00:05:07.140> blocks<00:05:07.470> as<00:05:07.650> well<00:05:08.220> as<00:05:08.400> many<00:05:08.670> of<00:05:08.850> the

00:05:08.930 --> 00:05:08.940 
those blocks as well as many of the

00:05:08.940 --> 00:05:10.820 
those blocks as well as many of the
other<00:05:09.060> things<00:05:09.300> I<00:05:09.450> showcased<00:05:09.930> here<00:05:10.050> before<00:05:10.380> so

00:05:10.820 --> 00:05:10.830 
other things I showcased here before so

00:05:10.830 --> 00:05:12.110

00:05:13.820 --> 00:05:13.830 
clear this is not confirmed but it is

00:05:13.830 --> 00:05:15.920 
clear this is not confirmed but it is

00:05:15.920 --> 00:05:15.930 
incredibly likely that we will be seeing

00:05:15.930 --> 00:05:17.480 
incredibly likely that we will be seeing
