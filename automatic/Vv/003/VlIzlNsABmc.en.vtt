00:02:48.890 --> 00:02:48.900 
episode now we have one dough that has

00:02:48.900 --> 00:02:52.580 
episode now we have one dough that has
12<00:02:49.350> layers<00:02:49.710> with<00:02:50.070> starch<00:02:50.459> between<00:02:50.910> them

00:02:52.580 --> 00:02:52.590 
12 layers with starch between them

00:02:52.590 --> 00:02:55.070 
12 layers with starch between them
I<00:02:52.620> will<00:02:53.250> continue<00:02:53.670> to<00:02:53.850> roll<00:02:54.180> this<00:02:54.390> to<00:02:54.630> answer

00:02:55.070 --> 00:02:55.080 
I will continue to roll this to answer

00:02:55.080 --> 00:02:59.320 
I will continue to roll this to answer
but<00:02:55.260> less<00:02:55.560> than<00:02:55.770> 1/2<00:02:55.980> centimeter<00:02:56.880> thick

00:02:59.320 --> 00:02:59.330 

00:02:59.330 --> 00:03:02.540 

because<00:03:00.330> we<00:03:00.780> will<00:03:00.960> cut<00:03:01.320> squares<00:03:01.860> from<00:03:02.190> it<00:03:02.400> to

00:03:02.540 --> 00:03:02.550 
because we will cut squares from it to

00:03:02.550 --> 00:03:04.610 
because we will cut squares from it to
try<00:03:02.790> to<00:03:02.850> give<00:03:03.210> a<00:03:03.240> rectangular<00:03:03.780> shape<00:03:04.290> when<00:03:04.590> you

00:03:04.610 --> 00:03:04.620 
try to give a rectangular shape when you

00:03:04.620 --> 00:03:07.399 
try to give a rectangular shape when you
roll<00:03:04.980> it

00:03:07.399 --> 00:03:07.409 

00:03:07.409 --> 00:03:10.309 

as<00:03:07.530> you<00:03:08.519> continue<00:03:08.790> to<00:03:09.120> tin<00:03:09.480> the<00:03:09.659> layers<00:03:09.870> you

00:03:10.309 --> 00:03:10.319 
as you continue to tin the layers you

00:03:10.319 --> 00:03:12.170 
as you continue to tin the layers you
may<00:03:10.500> want<00:03:10.739> to<00:03:10.860> separate<00:03:11.280> some<00:03:11.640> sheets<00:03:11.970> and

00:03:12.170 --> 00:03:12.180 
may want to separate some sheets and

00:03:12.180 --> 00:03:14.449 
may want to separate some sheets and
sprinkle<00:03:12.720> more<00:03:12.900> starch<00:03:13.319> on<00:03:13.560> them<00:03:13.799> to<00:03:14.040> make<00:03:14.250> it

00:03:14.449 --> 00:03:14.459 
sprinkle more starch on them to make it

00:03:14.459 --> 00:03:16.460 
sprinkle more starch on them to make it
even<00:03:14.909> and<00:03:15.120> make<00:03:15.720> sure<00:03:15.959> they<00:03:16.230> have<00:03:16.439> enough

00:03:16.460 --> 00:03:16.470 
even and make sure they have enough

00:03:16.470 --> 00:03:24.960 
even and make sure they have enough
starch

00:03:24.960 --> 00:03:24.970 

00:03:24.970 --> 00:03:28.110 

I<00:03:25.260> cut<00:03:26.260> the<00:03:26.470> dough<00:03:26.650> in<00:03:26.830> house<00:03:27.100> now<00:03:27.430> so<00:03:27.730> I<00:03:27.760> can

00:03:28.110 --> 00:03:28.120 
I cut the dough in house now so I can

00:03:28.120 --> 00:03:33.660 
I cut the dough in house now so I can
work<00:03:28.330> easily<00:03:30.030> and<00:03:31.800> after<00:03:32.800> all<00:03:33.040> it<00:03:33.220> didn't

00:03:33.660 --> 00:03:33.670 
work easily and after all it didn't

00:03:33.670 --> 00:03:38.810 
work easily and after all it didn't
Mortimer<00:03:34.210> we<00:03:34.570> can<00:03:34.780> begin<00:03:34.990> to<00:03:35.320> cut<00:03:35.500> squares<00:03:35.920> now

00:03:38.810 --> 00:03:38.820 

00:03:38.820 --> 00:03:41.520 

actually<00:03:39.820> because<00:03:40.180> I<00:03:40.330> was<00:03:40.570> in<00:03:40.750> a<00:03:40.840> very<00:03:41.050> I<00:03:41.170> guess
