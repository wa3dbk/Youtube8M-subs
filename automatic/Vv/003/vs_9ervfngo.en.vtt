with 16 inches like mine a good length
would<00:03:15.980> be<00:03:16.040> 20<00:03:16.519> inches<00:03:16.700> it<00:03:17.000> will<00:03:17.090> be<00:03:17.209> perfect

00:03:17.620 --> 00:03:17.630 
would be 20 inches it will be perfect

00:03:17.630 --> 00:03:19.090 
would be 20 inches it will be perfect
and<00:03:17.780> one<00:03:18.170> of<00:03:18.290> the<00:03:18.350> thing<00:03:18.590> we're<00:03:18.739> talking<00:03:19.040> about

00:03:19.090 --> 00:03:19.100 
and one of the thing we're talking about

00:03:19.100 --> 00:03:21.789 
and one of the thing we're talking about
we<00:03:19.459> since<00:03:20.030> it<00:03:20.209> is<00:03:20.330> a<00:03:20.420> lot<00:03:20.690> more<00:03:20.720> hair<00:03:21.290> you<00:03:21.680> are

00:03:21.789 --> 00:03:21.799 
we since it is a lot more hair you are

00:03:21.799 --> 00:03:23.050 
we since it is a lot more hair you are
going<00:03:21.980> to<00:03:22.040> have<00:03:22.160> a<00:03:22.190> different<00:03:22.489> amount<00:03:22.820> of

00:03:23.050 --> 00:03:23.060 
going to have a different amount of

00:03:23.060 --> 00:03:24.850 
going to have a different amount of
clips<00:03:23.390> that<00:03:23.510> you<00:03:23.810> have<00:03:24.019> somewhat<00:03:24.500> clicks<00:03:24.709> that

00:03:24.850 --> 00:03:24.860 
clips that you have somewhat clicks that

00:03:24.860 --> 00:03:26.530 
clips that you have somewhat clicks that
you<00:03:25.010> have<00:03:25.190> the<00:03:25.400> heavier<00:03:25.730> your<00:03:26.000> hand<00:03:26.239> might<00:03:26.390> be

00:03:26.530 --> 00:03:26.540 
you have the heavier your hand might be

00:03:26.540 --> 00:03:27.970 
you have the heavier your hand might be
and<00:03:26.810> there's<00:03:27.200> some<00:03:27.350> things<00:03:27.560> that<00:03:27.620> might<00:03:27.860> be

00:03:27.970 --> 00:03:27.980 
and there's some things that might be

00:03:27.980 --> 00:03:30.940 
and there's some things that might be
confusing<00:03:28.610> is<00:03:28.880> like<00:03:29.660> the<00:03:29.959> tombs<00:03:30.320> two<00:03:30.680> clips

00:03:30.940 --> 00:03:30.950 
confusing is like the tombs two clips

00:03:30.950 --> 00:03:32.979 
confusing is like the tombs two clips
three<00:03:31.250> clips<00:03:31.519> for<00:03:31.790> eclipse<00:03:32.090> one<00:03:32.299> clip<00:03:32.630> stuff

00:03:32.979 --> 00:03:32.989 
three clips for eclipse one clip stuff

00:03:32.989 --> 00:03:34.930 
three clips for eclipse one clip stuff
like<00:03:33.170> that<00:03:33.200> it's<00:03:33.799> really<00:03:34.040> really<00:03:34.370> simple<00:03:34.400> is

00:03:34.930 --> 00:03:34.940 
like that it's really really simple is

00:03:34.940 --> 00:03:37.000 
like that it's really really simple is
the<00:03:35.090> amount<00:03:35.269> of<00:03:35.450> cliffs<00:03:35.750> that<00:03:35.900> you<00:03:36.230> have<00:03:36.500> on<00:03:36.739> a

00:03:37.000 --> 00:03:37.010 
the amount of cliffs that you have on a

00:03:37.010 --> 00:03:39.370 
the amount of cliffs that you have on a
weft<00:03:37.280> of<00:03:37.579> hair<00:03:37.850> so<00:03:38.090> this<00:03:38.269> is<00:03:38.299> called<00:03:38.660> a<00:03:38.840> weft<00:03:39.079> of

00:03:39.370 --> 00:03:39.380 
weft of hair so this is called a weft of

00:03:39.380 --> 00:03:41.289 
weft of hair so this is called a weft of
hair<00:03:39.680> and<00:03:39.860> the<00:03:39.920> amount<00:03:40.280> eclipse<00:03:40.670> on<00:03:40.880> it<00:03:41.150> is

00:03:41.289 --> 00:03:41.299 
hair and the amount eclipse on it is

00:03:41.299 --> 00:03:43.210 
hair and the amount eclipse on it is
simply<00:03:41.780> what<00:03:41.989> you<00:03:42.140> would<00:03:42.260> call<00:03:42.440> this<00:03:42.799> web<00:03:43.040> go

00:03:43.210 --> 00:03:43.220 
simply what you would call this web go

at the middle of my air that is well put
in<00:04:01.579> the<00:04:01.700> first<00:04:01.970> three<00:04:02.360> clip<00:04:02.690> waft<00:04:03.079> so<00:04:03.380> I<00:04:03.440> will

00:04:03.550 --> 00:04:03.560 
in the first three clip waft so I will

00:04:03.560 --> 00:04:05.410 
in the first three clip waft so I will
stop<00:04:03.829> the<00:04:03.980> next<00:04:04.220> section<00:04:04.549> at<00:04:04.700> the<00:04:04.730> top<00:04:04.850> of<00:04:05.060> my

00:04:05.410 --> 00:04:05.420 
stop the next section at the top of my

00:04:05.420 --> 00:04:07.760 
stop the next section at the top of my
era<00:04:05.630> put<00:04:05.959> a<00:04:05.989> full<00:04:06.350> clip<00:04:06.680> left<00:04:07.070> in<00:04:07.340> there

era put a full clip left in there

00:04:07.770 --> 00:04:09.920 
era put a full clip left in there
and<00:04:07.860> then<00:04:08.280> this<00:04:08.850> depends<00:04:09.330> on<00:04:09.450> you<00:04:09.630> personally

00:04:09.920 --> 00:04:09.930

00:04:18.750 --> 00:04:21.020 
sides of my hair so we'll give me volume
on<00:04:18.959> this<00:04:19.170> side<00:04:19.380> but<00:04:19.890> for<00:04:20.130> this<00:04:20.250> extensions<00:04:20.880> i

00:04:21.020 --> 00:04:21.030 
on this side but for this extensions i

00:04:21.030 --> 00:04:22.970 
on this side but for this extensions i
do<00:04:21.090> something<00:04:21.540> called<00:04:21.750> a<00:04:21.930> double<00:04:22.290> left<00:04:22.530> where

00:04:22.970 --> 00:04:22.980 
do something called a double left where

00:04:22.980 --> 00:04:26.030 
do something called a double left where
it<00:04:23.130> clipped<00:04:23.400> to<00:04:23.760> wefts<00:04:24.690> together<00:04:25.410> so<00:04:25.770> here<00:04:25.950> I'm

00:04:26.030 --> 00:04:26.040 
it clipped to wefts together so here I'm

00:04:26.040 --> 00:04:28.730 
it clipped to wefts together so here I'm
gonna<00:04:26.130> put<00:04:26.430> these<00:04:26.700> two<00:04:27.090> to<00:04:27.810> clip<00:04:28.200> wefts

00:04:28.730 --> 00:04:28.740 
gonna put these two to clip wefts

00:04:28.740 --> 00:04:30.710 
gonna put these two to clip wefts
together<00:04:29.400> I<00:04:29.640> know<00:04:29.730> it<00:04:30.000> sounds<00:04:30.120> confusing<00:04:30.570> but

00:04:30.710 --> 00:04:30.720 
together I know it sounds confusing but

00:04:30.720 --> 00:04:32.240 
together I know it sounds confusing but
you're<00:04:30.960> seeing<00:04:31.200> what<00:04:31.290> I'm<00:04:31.410> doing<00:04:31.710> so<00:04:32.100> it

00:04:32.240 --> 00:04:32.250 
you're seeing what I'm doing so it

00:04:32.250 --> 00:04:34.010 
you're seeing what I'm doing so it
basically<00:04:32.490> means<00:04:33.000> that<00:04:33.150> I<00:04:33.270> have<00:04:33.300> one<00:04:33.720> clip

00:04:34.010 --> 00:04:34.020 
basically means that I have one clip

00:04:34.020 --> 00:04:36.050 
basically means that I have one clip
with<00:04:34.200> a<00:04:34.230> lot<00:04:34.590> more<00:04:34.830> volume<00:04:35.340> in<00:04:35.490> it<00:04:35.610> we're<00:04:35.970> not

00:04:36.050 --> 00:04:36.060 
with a lot more volume in it we're not

00:04:36.060 --> 00:04:37.820 
with a lot more volume in it we're not
having<00:04:36.420> to<00:04:36.540> put<00:04:36.720> two<00:04:37.020> separate<00:04:37.410> clips<00:04:37.620> in<00:04:37.800> my

00:04:37.820 --> 00:04:37.830 
having to put two separate clips in my

00:04:37.830 --> 00:04:39.590 
having to put two separate clips in my
hair<00:04:37.920> and<00:04:38.070> I<00:04:38.220> think<00:04:38.460> it<00:04:38.520> fast<00:04:38.700> really<00:04:39.390> really

00:04:39.590 --> 00:04:39.600 
hair and I think it fast really really

00:04:39.600 --> 00:04:41.150 
hair and I think it fast really really
good<00:04:39.810> you<00:04:40.020> have<00:04:40.200> really<00:04:40.590> sitting<00:04:40.860> here<00:04:40.980> like

00:04:41.150 --> 00:04:41.160 
good you have really sitting here like

00:04:41.160 --> 00:04:42.770 
good you have really sitting here like
me<00:04:41.370> because<00:04:41.760> you<00:04:42.030> would<00:04:42.180> have<00:04:42.360> to<00:04:42.480> worry<00:04:42.660> about

00:04:42.770 --> 00:04:42.780 
me because you would have to worry about

00:04:42.780 --> 00:04:44.660 
me because you would have to worry about
it<00:04:43.020> peeking<00:04:43.410> through<00:04:43.680> anything<00:04:44.010> like<00:04:44.160> that<00:04:44.340> so

00:04:44.660 --> 00:04:44.670 
it peeking through anything like that so
