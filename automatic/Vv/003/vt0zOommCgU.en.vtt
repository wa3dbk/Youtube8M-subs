in<00:00:28.140> the<00:00:28.199> game<00:00:28.349> was<00:00:28.529> just<00:00:28.710> a<00:00:28.949> multiplayer

00:00:29.900 --> 00:00:29.910 
in the game was just a multiplayer

00:00:29.910 --> 00:00:31.849 
in the game was just a multiplayer
shooter<00:00:30.269> that<00:00:30.900> doesn't<00:00:31.260> really<00:00:31.380> have<00:00:31.619> a<00:00:31.650> lot

00:00:31.849 --> 00:00:31.859 
shooter that doesn't really have a lot

00:00:31.859 --> 00:00:34.040

and we talked about this in a podcast I
believe<00:01:58.340> but<00:01:59.340> looks<00:02:00.090> like<00:02:00.149> this<00:02:00.360> is<00:02:00.450> going<00:02:00.570> to

00:02:00.649 --> 00:02:00.659 
believe but looks like this is going to

00:02:00.659 --> 00:02:03.380 
believe but looks like this is going to
be<00:02:00.719> the<00:02:00.840> most<00:02:01.020> expensive<00:02:02.119> generation<00:02:03.119> of<00:02:03.210> game

00:02:03.380 --> 00:02:03.390 
be the most expensive generation of game

00:02:03.390 --> 00:02:07.219 
be the most expensive generation of game
and<00:02:03.570> Evan<00:02:03.950> it<00:02:04.950> really<00:02:05.130> does<00:02:05.399> yeah<00:02:05.729> you<00:02:06.509> didn't

00:02:07.219 --> 00:02:07.229 
and Evan it really does yeah you didn't

00:02:07.229 --> 00:02:07.500 
and Evan it really does yeah you didn't
think

00:02:07.500 --> 00:02:07.510 
think

00:02:07.510 --> 00:02:09.090 
think
can<00:02:07.630> get<00:02:07.780> any<00:02:07.930> worse<00:02:08.110> was<00:02:08.350> getting<00:02:08.710> worse<00:02:08.860> okay

00:02:09.090 --> 00:02:09.100 
can get any worse was getting worse okay

00:02:09.100 --> 00:02:11.670 
can get any worse was getting worse okay

doing<00:03:17.500> that<00:03:17.530> because<00:03:17.770> all<00:03:18.040> you're<00:03:18.220> doing<00:03:18.459> is

00:03:18.600 --> 00:03:18.610 
doing that because all you're doing is

00:03:18.610 --> 00:03:21.150 
doing that because all you're doing is
you're<00:03:19.470> supporting<00:03:20.470> it<00:03:20.620> and<00:03:20.800> when<00:03:21.130> you

00:03:21.150 --> 00:03:21.160 
you're supporting it and when you

00:03:21.160 --> 00:03:22.680 
you're supporting it and when you
support<00:03:21.550> it<00:03:21.670> the<00:03:21.790> developers<00:03:22.360> are<00:03:22.480> going<00:03:22.600> to

00:03:22.680 --> 00:03:22.690 
support it the developers are going to

00:03:22.690 --> 00:03:24.750 
support it the developers are going to
see<00:03:22.870> that<00:03:23.110> you're<00:03:23.709> supporting<00:03:24.040> this<00:03:24.280> nonsense

00:03:24.750 --> 00:03:24.760 
see that you're supporting this nonsense

00:03:24.760 --> 00:03:25.740 
see that you're supporting this nonsense
and<00:03:24.880> they're<00:03:24.970> going<00:03:25.090> to<00:03:25.150> keep<00:03:25.360> doing<00:03:25.390> it

00:03:25.740 --> 00:03:25.750 
and they're going to keep doing it

00:03:25.750 --> 00:03:27.060 
and they're going to keep doing it
that's<00:03:26.200> what<00:03:26.350> happened<00:03:26.530> with<00:03:26.590> call<00:03:26.800> of<00:03:26.890> duty

00:03:27.060 --> 00:03:27.070 
that's what happened with call of duty

00:03:27.070 --> 00:03:28.320 
that's what happened with call of duty
for<00:03:27.280> you<00:03:27.489> know<00:03:27.580> they<00:03:27.700> started<00:03:27.970> charging<00:03:28.060> for

00:03:29.729 --> 00:03:29.739 
maps and Pete was actually stupid enough

00:03:29.739 --> 00:03:33.300 
maps and Pete was actually stupid enough
to<00:03:29.950> buy<00:03:30.130> it<00:03:30.190> and<00:03:31.470> what<00:03:32.470> happened<00:03:32.620> is<00:03:33.010> after

00:03:33.300 --> 00:03:33.310 
to buy it and what happened is after

00:03:33.310 --> 00:03:34.949 
to buy it and what happened is after
that<00:03:33.610> they<00:03:33.760> saw<00:03:33.970> that<00:03:34.000> they<00:03:34.209> could<00:03:34.360> always<00:03:34.810> do

00:03:34.949 --> 00:03:34.959 
that they saw that they could always do

00:03:34.959 --> 00:03:36.240 
that they saw that they could always do
this<00:03:35.110> and<00:03:35.260> they<00:03:35.320> just<00:03:35.470> kept<00:03:35.680> order<00:03:35.950> to<00:03:36.010> making

00:03:36.240 --> 00:03:36.250 
this and they just kept order to making

00:03:36.250 --> 00:03:39.560 
this and they just kept order to making
it<00:03:36.340> worse<00:03:36.489> and<00:03:36.760> worse<00:03:36.880> so<00:03:37.690> now

00:03:39.560 --> 00:03:39.570 
it worse and worse so now

00:03:39.570 --> 00:03:42.960 
it worse and worse so now
microtransactions<00:03:40.570> have<00:03:41.200> started<00:03:41.560> so<00:03:42.370> before

00:03:42.960 --> 00:03:42.970 
microtransactions have started so before

00:03:42.970 --> 00:03:44.490 
microtransactions have started so before
the<00:03:43.060> current<00:03:43.239> gen<00:03:43.540> did<00:03:43.959> you<00:03:44.140> know<00:03:44.260> they

00:03:44.490 --> 00:03:44.500 
the current gen did you know they

00:03:44.500 --> 00:03:46.710 
the current gen did you know they
started<00:03:44.830> this<00:03:44.920> home<00:03:45.720> microtransaction

00:03:46.710 --> 00:03:46.720 
started this home microtransaction

00:03:46.720 --> 00:03:49.140 
started this home microtransaction
market<00:03:47.050> which<00:03:47.769> microtransactions<00:03:48.730> was<00:03:48.850> going

00:03:49.140 --> 00:03:49.150 
market which microtransactions was going

00:03:49.150 --> 00:03:51.930 
market which microtransactions was going
on<00:03:49.269> for<00:03:49.570> a<00:03:49.600> while<00:03:49.660> or<00:03:49.989> the<00:03:50.050> pc<00:03:50.440> right<00:03:51.280> the<00:03:51.610> only

00:03:51.930 --> 00:03:51.940 
on for a while or the pc right the only

00:03:51.940 --> 00:03:54.390 
on for a while or the pc right the only
difference<00:03:52.209> is<00:03:52.630> that<00:03:52.959> micro<00:03:53.739> transactions<00:03:54.340> on

00:03:54.390 --> 00:03:54.400 
difference is that micro transactions on

00:03:54.400 --> 00:03:56.910 
difference is that micro transactions on
the<00:03:54.489> pc<00:03:54.850> were<00:03:55.090> on<00:03:55.330> free<00:03:55.780> to<00:03:55.989> play<00:03:56.110> game<00:03:56.200> so<00:03:56.769> get

00:03:56.910 --> 00:03:56.920 
the pc were on free to play game so get

00:03:56.920 --> 00:03:58.680 
the pc were on free to play game so get

00:04:31.940 --> 00:04:33.040 
actually got to pay for just to get but
like<00:04:32.060> I<00:04:32.120> said<00:04:32.180> that<00:04:32.480> makes<00:04:32.660> sense<00:04:32.900> because

00:04:33.040 --> 00:04:33.050 
like I said that makes sense because

00:04:33.050 --> 00:04:34.150 
like I said that makes sense because
it's<00:04:33.260> a<00:04:33.320> free-to-play<00:04:33.770> game<00:04:33.980> the

00:04:34.150 --> 00:04:34.160 
it's a free-to-play game the

00:04:34.160 --> 00:04:35.410 
it's a free-to-play game the
developments<00:04:34.580> have<00:04:34.700> to<00:04:34.820> make<00:04:34.940> money<00:04:35.180> somehow

00:04:35.410 --> 00:04:35.420 
developments have to make money somehow

00:04:35.420 --> 00:04:37.660 
developments have to make money somehow
off<00:04:35.750> the<00:04:35.870> game<00:04:36.050> right<00:04:36.290> so<00:04:36.590> that<00:04:37.250> is<00:04:37.400> a<00:04:37.430> way<00:04:37.640> to

00:04:37.660 --> 00:04:37.670 
off the game right so that is a way to

00:04:37.670 --> 00:04:39.220 
off the game right so that is a way to
do<00:04:37.880> it<00:04:38.000> you<00:04:38.030> make<00:04:38.240> it<00:04:38.360> harder<00:04:38.750> to<00:04:38.780> earn<00:04:38.990> this

00:04:39.220 --> 00:04:39.230 
do it you make it harder to earn this

00:04:39.230 --> 00:04:41.740 
do it you make it harder to earn this
stuff<00:04:39.500> and<00:04:40.100> you<00:04:40.550> make<00:04:40.700> it<00:04:40.850> easier<00:04:41.240> to<00:04:41.300> just<00:04:41.600> pay

00:04:41.740 --> 00:04:41.750 
stuff and you make it easier to just pay

00:04:41.750 --> 00:04:45.190 
stuff and you make it easier to just pay
forward<00:04:42.430> but<00:04:43.430> on<00:04:44.060> the<00:04:44.300> consoles<00:04:44.780> know<00:04:44.900> you<00:04:45.050> got

00:04:45.190 --> 00:04:45.200 
forward but on the consoles know you got

00:04:45.200 --> 00:04:46.780 
forward but on the consoles know you got
games<00:04:45.470> that<00:04:45.650> you<00:04:45.800> already<00:04:46.010> paid<00:04:46.310> sixty<00:04:46.760> bucks

00:04:46.780 --> 00:04:46.790 
games that you already paid sixty bucks

00:04:46.790 --> 00:04:49.300 
games that you already paid sixty bucks
for<00:04:47.330> not<00:04:48.140> only<00:04:48.350> do<00:04:48.530> you<00:04:48.560> got<00:04:48.740> paid<00:04:48.950> sixty<00:04:49.280> bucks
