00:03:12.140 --> 00:03:12.150 
on the quite often I'll look at a

00:03:12.150 --> 00:03:14.030 
on the quite often I'll look at a
one-shot<00:03:12.540> angle<00:03:12.840> like<00:03:12.989> this<00:03:13.019> and<00:03:13.409> realize

00:03:14.030 --> 00:03:14.040 
one-shot angle like this and realize

00:03:14.040 --> 00:03:16.009 
one-shot angle like this and realize
there<00:03:14.219> isn't<00:03:14.370> one<00:03:14.669> and<00:03:14.879> there<00:03:15.540> I'll<00:03:15.689> give<00:03:15.900> up

00:03:55.610 --> 00:03:55.620 
helpless with all the stopping power but

00:03:55.620 --> 00:03:57.530 
helpless with all the stopping power but
I<00:03:55.680> feel<00:03:55.859> like<00:03:55.889> wall<00:03:56.489> bounce<00:03:56.759> is<00:03:56.970> the<00:03:57.090> key<00:03:57.329> and

on<00:04:58.470> and<00:04:58.740> but<00:04:59.250> I<00:04:59.490> feel<00:05:00.270> like<00:05:00.300> just<00:05:00.660> you<00:05:01.080> know

00:05:01.220 --> 00:05:01.230

00:05:01.230 --> 00:05:03.320 
on and but I feel like just you know
when<00:05:01.620> you're<00:05:01.740> kicking<00:05:01.890> back<00:05:02.250> and<00:05:02.520> you<00:05:03.000> put<00:05:03.210> in

00:05:03.320 --> 00:05:03.330 
when you're kicking back and you put in

00:05:03.330 --> 00:05:05.090 
when you're kicking back and you put in
a<00:05:03.390> good<00:05:03.540> session<00:05:03.810> I'm<00:05:04.050> not<00:05:04.200> talking<00:05:04.560> I<00:05:04.680> I<00:05:04.830> used

00:05:05.090 --> 00:05:05.100 
a good session I'm not talking I I used

00:05:05.100 --> 00:05:07.400

00:05:07.400 --> 00:05:07.410 
to come on for like an hour and expect

00:05:07.410 --> 00:05:09.530 
to come on for like an hour and expect
to<00:05:07.440> just<00:05:07.650> be<00:05:07.830> on<00:05:07.950> it<00:05:08.130> that<00:05:08.460> the<00:05:09.240> way<00:05:09.360> the<00:05:09.510> game

00:05:09.530 --> 00:05:09.540 
to just be on it that the way the game

00:05:09.540 --> 00:05:11.990 
to just be on it that the way the game
is<00:05:09.720> you<00:05:10.050> can't<00:05:10.290> do<00:05:10.500> that<00:05:10.680> really<00:05:10.950> you<00:05:11.670> do<00:05:11.880> have

00:05:11.990 --> 00:05:12.000 
is you can't do that really you do have

00:05:12.000 --> 00:05:14.960 
is you can't do that really you do have
to<00:05:12.090> put<00:05:12.360> the<00:05:12.390> time<00:05:12.540> in<00:05:13.020> and<00:05:13.700> again<00:05:14.700> that<00:05:14.850> was

00:05:14.960 --> 00:05:14.970 
to put the time in and again that was

00:05:14.970 --> 00:05:17.120 
to put the time in and again that was
just<00:05:15.150> a<00:05:15.240> little<00:05:15.480> little<00:05:16.200> streak<00:05:16.620> that<00:05:17.010> I've

00:05:17.120 --> 00:05:17.130 
just a little little streak that I've

00:05:17.130 --> 00:05:21.110 
just a little little streak that I've
got<00:05:17.370> em<00:05:17.630> in<00:05:18.630> that<00:05:19.100> in<00:05:20.100> the<00:05:20.250> 1<00:05:20.430> clip<00:05:20.640> of<00:05:20.790> sniper

00:05:21.110 --> 00:05:21.120 
got em in that in the 1 clip of sniper

00:05:21.120 --> 00:05:22.870 
got em in that in the 1 clip of sniper
so<00:05:21.390> felt<00:05:21.630> that<00:05:21.750> was<00:05:21.840> a<00:05:21.870> bit<00:05:22.020> consistent<00:05:22.620> and

00:05:22.870 --> 00:05:22.880 
so felt that was a bit consistent and

00:05:22.880 --> 00:05:25.970 
so felt that was a bit consistent and
well<00:05:23.880> I<00:05:24.270> really<00:05:24.900> do<00:05:25.020> feel<00:05:25.050> there's<00:05:25.470> been<00:05:25.680> going

00:05:25.970 --> 00:05:25.980 
well I really do feel there's been going

00:05:25.980 --> 00:05:29.330 
well I really do feel there's been going
