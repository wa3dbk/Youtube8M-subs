00:00:25.550 --> 00:00:34.250
 It's a motorcycle now in the US It's just now 

00:00:30.500 --> 00:00:37.430
 Maybe he did a local delivery on a pony. 

00:00:34.250 --> 00:00:42.110
 It 's not a game in our country. 

00:00:37.430 --> 00:00:47.500
 Google has just about these events well face military action packed event boyfriend Rum well 

00:00:42.110 --> 00:00:47.500
 I think it will be such a nice boyfriend to take care of . 

00:00:47.609 --> 00:00:54.360
 And today I did not know the existence of this game originally, 

00:00:51.300 --> 00:00:57.600
 The ship is sick and I'm going to do a great job in the bathroom. 

00:00:54.360 --> 00:01:01.350
 I pulled without doing a big job, 

00:00:57.600 --> 00:01:03.769
 I'm figuring out the game. But wait deunyo'll just shut up 

00:01:01.350 --> 00:01:03.769

00:01:09.759 --> 00:01:12.270
 Smarter 

00:01:12.460 --> 00:01:17.460
 This is not it a bit too small, it's the sound coming this time 

00:01:17.600 --> 00:01:23.940
 Tear off again 

00:01:19.860 --> 00:01:28.940
 We'll go back to the beginning from the beginning . 

00:01:23.940 --> 00:01:28.940
 944 with the Baros game 

00:01:29.170 --> 00:01:37.259
 Pony Express Air also means that Pony is a pony. 

00:01:33.549 --> 00:01:37.259
 Move it up and down the keyboard. 

00:01:37.760 --> 00:01:46.180

00:01:47.630 --> 00:01:52.180
 A mini-game is like a mini- game . 

00:01:52.400 --> 00:02:04.280
 I think I made a short chapter president stating that these two events this day 

00:01:58.550 --> 00:02:05.450
 Juggling Google with these events and subtitles just came out of that awkward pit 

00:02:04.280 --> 00:02:11.380
 No dropping 

00:02:05.450 --> 00:02:11.380
 Yeah, I used to wear that google that juggles in the old days. 

00:02:11.420 --> 00:02:18.080
 What a simple game 

00:02:13.519 --> 00:02:22.300
 I think it's step by step. 

00:02:18.080 --> 00:02:22.300
 Where Did billion haejugo replacement 

00:02:22.860 --> 00:02:30.240

00:02:25.740 --> 00:02:32.130
 Only a short dalrimyeon difficult because the speed is slow SiO say now reversed 

00:02:30.240 --> 00:02:36.750

00:02:39.360 --> 00:02:45.960
 But what I have to go down go down go down now 

00:02:42.360 --> 00:02:51.600
 When you go down you have to hit it thin. 

00:02:45.960 --> 00:02:57.090
 Oh, give me one ah gotta eat bonanza had continued 

00:02:51.600 --> 00:02:59.430
 I feel like this is something I do not know, I feel like an ominous feeling is always wrong 

00:02:57.090 --> 00:03:04.680
 No points. 

00:02:59.430 --> 00:03:10.620
 Just do not know the game is really simple, easy and fun 

00:03:04.680 --> 00:03:14.690
 I thought I made to break up seems no apparent not feel great fun 

00:03:10.620 --> 00:03:14.690
 The horse does not get stuck once and the person gets stoned. 

00:03:15.220 --> 00:03:22.420
 Map is a little western era. 

00:03:18.909 --> 00:03:26.440
 I saw a nearly melting West era like Abber. 

00:03:22.420 --> 00:03:29.920
 Somehow I caught my word geogun my little friends say 

00:03:26.440 --> 00:03:32.950
 I write 4 of the 

00:03:29.920 --> 00:03:36.780
 Or the original word does not hurt those.I'm 

00:03:32.950 --> 00:03:36.780
 I got caught up in what I caught 

00:03:37.390 --> 00:03:40.349
 I think I'm almost done . 

00:03:41.680 --> 00:03:50.379
 It's easy and a little difficult. 

00:03:44.409 --> 00:03:53.709
 Ah on top 

00:03:50.379 --> 00:03:59.049

00:04:08.080 --> 00:04:16.829
 Pony Express 155. There's nothing. 

00:04:11.410 --> 00:04:18.670
 Google is one of 4 these new games that are able to fit only the day 

00:04:16.829 --> 00:04:23.200
 I did it. 

00:04:18.670 --> 00:04:26.080
 It's funny. It 's not funny. It's a little fenny. 

00:04:23.200 --> 00:04:30.610
 I think it's really good to let me know. 

00:04:26.080 --> 00:04:32.970
