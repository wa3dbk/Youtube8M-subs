00:00:01.319 --> 00:00:05.590
 In this video, I will show one of the ways of beading the beads. 

00:00:05.590 --> 00:00:10.120
 For this you need beads, monofilament or ordinary threads and beads, 

00:00:10.120 --> 00:00:11.580
 which will braid. 

00:00:11.580 --> 00:00:16.440
 I took a monofilament and a transparent bead, 1.5 cm in diameter. 

00:00:16.440 --> 00:00:18.720
 In the beginning we make a belt. 

00:00:18.720 --> 00:00:21.150
 It is made in the technique of "Mosaic weaving". 

00:00:21.150 --> 00:00:25.490
 I will leave a link to the video, it shows how to make it. 

00:00:25.490 --> 00:00:30.259
 The finished belt must completely embrace the bead, for this 

00:00:30.259 --> 00:00:35.940
 try on and fasten the edges of the weave in a circle. 

00:00:35.940 --> 00:00:38.660
 How to fix them is also at the end of the previous one. 

00:00:38.660 --> 00:00:58.010
 video. 

00:00:58.010 --> 00:01:03.129
 Dress the belt on the bead and continue to braid. 

00:01:03.129 --> 00:01:07.860
 We collect bead, pass the needle between the upper gaps. 

00:01:07.860 --> 00:01:25.619
 And now we pass from above the top through this bead. 

00:01:25.619 --> 00:03:02.850
 Again, dial bead and perform the same steps. 

00:03:02.850 --> 00:04:05.840
 Here we finish this series and move to a new one. 

00:04:05.840 --> 00:04:08.150
 Almost finish the first half. 

00:04:08.150 --> 00:06:39.080
 Now we take the needle to the remaining side and all 

00:06:39.080 --> 00:07:35.389
 do the same as the first side. 

00:07:35.389 --> 00:07:42.460
 Here is the finished ball. 

00:07:42.460 --> 00:07:54.740
 You can also make earrings 

00:07:54.740 --> 00:07:56.510
 or bracelet. 

00:07:56.510 --> 00:08:06.460
 Here I braided wood beads. 

00:08:06.460 --> 00:08:07.840
 Thank you for watching!
