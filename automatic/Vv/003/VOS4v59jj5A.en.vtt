00:00:00.629 --> 00:00:03.629
 driven by still guilty us became narrow 

00:00:04.210 --> 00:00:07.300
 Tobacco criticized about three weeks ago 

00:00:07.300 --> 00:00:10.799
 but no time to make video 

00:00:10.799 --> 00:00:14.039
 and here you see the drip from next door was superior 

00:00:14.759 --> 00:00:17.759
 Snooker planned to bring Opel 

00:00:19.169 --> 00:00:20.630
 What is he doing there 

00:00:20.630 --> 00:00:23.329
 when the plant 

00:00:23.329 --> 00:00:26.730
 so after lectures it says old paper has developed leaves 

00:00:27.550 --> 00:00:29.999
 then believe me 

00:00:29.999 --> 00:00:33.230
 Not only does MÃ¼ller think he will come out of it 

00:00:33.230 --> 00:00:36.510
 with crumbles so that only the individual plants have to lie 

00:00:37.350 --> 00:00:40.700
 and then he places the island 

00:00:40.700 --> 00:00:43.700
 we still have the remaining plants in the top ten 

00:00:44.440 --> 00:00:47.440
 if they have already developed to 

00:00:47.950 --> 00:00:50.800
 and her son a server 

00:00:50.800 --> 00:00:55.040
 Bonds of the plants have become something more than screen reporters met 

00:00:57.210 --> 00:00:59.540
 Over here you can see 

00:00:59.540 --> 00:01:01.040
 Scared Migros 

00:01:01.040 --> 00:01:04.040
 The ventilation can actually tell 

00:01:04.850 --> 00:01:09.130
 nine of these ready sets a separate pots the maxims is very fast and 

00:01:09.130 --> 00:01:10.930
 very large 

00:01:10.930 --> 00:01:14.549
 These are actually already so far that you could expose yours to them 

00:01:15.390 --> 00:01:18.390
 that will already do Scheinig this weekend 

00:01:19.110 --> 00:01:22.110
 Dornbirn 2 Kirsch still the Regina 

00:01:25.320 --> 00:01:28.320
 The world was obviously at a cost 

00:01:28.940 --> 00:01:31.940
 here would be and set at Qom box 

00:01:33.390 --> 00:01:36.570
 Women would go there and we were lucky too due to the exam 

00:01:37.160 --> 00:01:38.210
 we give 

00:01:38.210 --> 00:01:41.210
 less and less often is empty 

00:01:43.420 --> 00:01:46.250
 But that has nothing to do with the smallest 

00:01:46.250 --> 00:01:48.100
 or with the with the 

00:01:48.100 --> 00:01:49.390
 with the place 

00:01:49.390 --> 00:01:51.110
 for Manuel the new goal 

00:01:51.110 --> 00:01:54.300
 Right outside were all the time 

00:01:54.300 --> 00:01:57.300
 I hope the thing is a bit more robust 

00:01:58.450 --> 00:02:01.360
 in that they were already in the cold 

00:02:01.360 --> 00:02:04.740
 at night he was still around the freezing point 

00:02:04.740 --> 00:02:08.220
 but if you are still well developed, you can easily tolerate it 

00:02:08.220 --> 00:02:10.129
 a few minus temperatures 

00:02:10.129 --> 00:02:14.090
 yes, it should not be permanently below zero degrees 

00:02:17.349 --> 00:02:20.349
 and otherwise tolerated as I said very well 

00:02:21.359 --> 00:02:24.259
 they are also a little bit smaller, I do not know if Taurus too 

00:02:24.259 --> 00:02:26.579
 Weekend already out sets 

00:02:26.579 --> 00:02:29.799
 Here comes the young man Markus Katzer and digs out the likes 

00:02:31.279 --> 00:02:34.279
 but probably it will make you know a move again 

00:02:35.389 --> 00:02:38.679
 So with the balcony Carstens also as said No Sion 

00:02:38.679 --> 00:02:41.679
 Here you can also set apart a bit 

00:02:42.209 --> 00:02:45.209
 so you do not have to use it 

00:02:46.649 --> 00:02:49.649
 so the Wars first so far for tobacco cultivation 

00:02:52.449 --> 00:02:54.079
 and Simon to the next hill
