00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.310
 people keep running to my 

00:00:02.250 --> 00:00:08.880
 sword I'll give you an easy way out 

00:00:05.310 --> 00:00:13.019
 There is no cure for fools killing me. 

00:00:08.880 --> 00:00:15.960
 You can try, it 's just death, nothing serious. 

00:00:13.019 --> 00:00:20.520
 Be brief, do not start what I go. 

00:00:15.960 --> 00:00:23.609
 Finish, you're in peace, because you're going to stay. 

00:00:20.520 --> 00:00:26.970
 certain things do not lose the right thread 

00:00:23.609 --> 00:00:28.859
 errors can not make twice not 

00:00:26.970 --> 00:00:32.399
 i will die of honor 

00:00:28.859 --> 00:00:36.329
 Enough to run away I alone decide my 

00:00:32.399 --> 00:00:38.879
 fate a sword a purpose yet 

00:00:36.329 --> 00:00:59.370
 it's not time to die 

00:00:38.879 --> 00:01:05.610
 O O O O 13 quick strokes 

00:00:59.370 --> 00:01:10.439
 expect this technique another sword of 

00:01:05.610 --> 00:01:17.220
 hot wind taught it the sword above 

00:01:10.439 --> 00:01:19.259
 of everything except a good drink to whom 

00:01:17.220 --> 00:01:23.720
 said that I am unbalanced when 

00:01:19.259 --> 00:01:52.259
 there are three certainties in life to honor 

00:01:23.720 --> 00:01:55.200
 death and hangovers a sword a lousy 

00:01:52.259 --> 00:01:57.659
 company in long journeys my honor 

00:01:55.200 --> 00:02:00.719
 Forsaken me a long time ago. 

00:01:57.659 --> 00:02:03.990
 tomorrow is not guaranteed to anyone follow 

00:02:00.719 --> 00:02:07.409
 wind but be aware of the burden of this 

00:02:03.990 --> 00:02:08.340
 sword never diminishes virtues do not pass 

00:02:07.409 --> 00:02:10.649
 of a luxury 

00:02:08.340 --> 00:02:13.010
 the road to ruin is shorter than 

00:02:10.649 --> 00:02:16.640
 What do you think about sleeping? 

00:02:13.010 --> 00:02:20.360
 it is to the books of guilt justice that 

00:02:16.640 --> 00:02:21.170
 beautiful word one step ahead of 

00:02:20.360 --> 00:02:23.569
 past 

00:02:21.170 --> 00:02:26.329
 a wanderer is not always lost 

00:02:23.569 --> 00:02:29.360
 I'm just looking for a way home. 

00:02:26.329 --> 00:02:32.090
 Could never stay in one place 

00:02:29.360 --> 00:02:35.269
 I will follow this path until the end of 

00:02:32.090 --> 00:02:38.150
 honor is in the heart no name i do not 

00:02:35.269 --> 00:02:39.680
 I will forget whose story I am 

00:02:38.150 --> 00:02:42.170
 not over yet 

00:02:39.680 --> 00:02:45.799
 would be the sole purpose of the fall leaf 

00:02:42.170 --> 00:02:54.190
 and dying is the easy part 

00:02:45.799 --> 00:03:00.260
 or pedro zÃ³ dom razek tear south yon 

00:02:54.190 --> 00:03:07.159
 in front of the wind floor 

00:03:00.260 --> 00:03:10.180
 there is death to mine or yours to come 

00:03:07.159 --> 00:03:10.180
 to kill me 

00:03:10.599 --> 00:03:18.530
 better bring friends kill people is 

00:03:13.849 --> 00:03:20.799
 a bad habit but I can not 

00:03:18.530 --> 00:03:26.290
 stop the south 

00:03:20.799 --> 00:03:32.239
 I never heard of the use or for longer run 

00:03:26.290 --> 00:03:35.859
 swords boots crawl back to 

00:03:32.239 --> 00:03:40.459
 Your shadows ninja ninja 

00:03:35.859 --> 00:03:43.549
 I hate these guys, but pretty face. 

00:03:40.459 --> 00:03:48.019
 It was the mother who stitched what weighs 

00:03:43.549 --> 00:03:51.230
 will your sword or your conscience 

00:03:48.019 --> 00:03:54.949
 everybody has accounts to set the event 

00:03:51.230 --> 00:03:58.699
 You can not escape from this same level I 

00:03:54.949 --> 00:04:04.040
 already tried broken spirit sword 

00:03:58.699 --> 00:04:06.489
