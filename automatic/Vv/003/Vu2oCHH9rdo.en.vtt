00:03:22.400 --> 00:03:22.410 
that's because I'm balloon isn't out

00:03:22.410 --> 00:03:24.539 
that's because I'm balloon isn't out
he'll<00:03:23.410> probably<00:03:23.560> come<00:03:23.799> out<00:03:23.950> one<00:03:24.099> moon<00:03:24.280> comes

00:03:24.539 --> 00:03:24.549 
he'll probably come out one moon comes

00:03:24.549 --> 00:03:27.449 
he'll probably come out one moon comes
out<00:03:24.730> which<00:03:25.569> will<00:03:25.810> probably<00:03:26.049> forever<00:03:26.680> be<00:03:27.099> to<00:03:27.310> do

00:03:27.449 --> 00:03:27.459 
out which will probably forever be to do

00:03:27.459 --> 00:03:29.039 
out which will probably forever be to do
the<00:03:27.579> fact<00:03:27.790> that<00:03:27.910> ascension<00:03:28.299> isn't<00:03:28.690> even<00:03:28.930> out

00:03:29.039 --> 00:03:29.049 
the fact that ascension isn't even out

00:03:29.049 --> 00:03:45.250 
the fact that ascension isn't even out
yet

00:03:45.250 --> 00:03:45.260
