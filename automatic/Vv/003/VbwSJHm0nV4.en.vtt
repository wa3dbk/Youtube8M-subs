now I have a giant twist this is the
battery<00:00:11.370> pack<00:00:11.639> for<00:00:11.940> it<00:00:12.230> when<00:00:13.230> I<00:00:13.259> rented<00:00:14.040> this

00:00:14.209 --> 00:00:14.219 
battery pack for it when I rented this

00:00:14.219 --> 00:00:16.880 
battery pack for it when I rented this
today<00:00:14.730> the<00:00:15.480> battery<00:00:15.809> was<00:00:16.020> totally<00:00:16.410> depleted

00:00:16.880 --> 00:00:16.890 
today the battery was totally depleted

00:00:16.890 --> 00:00:18.320 
today the battery was totally depleted
so<00:00:17.100> I<00:00:17.130> had<00:00:17.340> to<00:00:17.430> come<00:00:17.580> up<00:00:17.609> here<00:00:17.820> and<00:00:17.940> charge<00:00:18.180> it

00:00:18.320 --> 00:00:18.330 
so I had to come up here and charge it

00:00:18.330 --> 00:00:20.450 
so I had to come up here and charge it
first<00:00:18.570> and<00:00:18.990> we're<00:00:19.830> going<00:00:19.859> to<00:00:20.039> go<00:00:20.130> outside<00:00:20.279> and

00:00:20.450 --> 00:00:20.460 
first and we're going to go outside and

00:00:20.460 --> 00:00:24.500 
first and we're going to go outside and
take<00:00:20.640> a<00:00:20.730> look<00:00:20.760> at<00:00:21.000> it<00:00:21.090> right<00:00:21.210> now<00:00:23.150> this<00:00:24.150> is<00:00:24.480> a

00:00:24.500 --> 00:00:24.510 
take a look at it right now this is a

00:00:24.510 --> 00:00:27.800 
take a look at it right now this is a
giant<00:00:24.869> twist<00:00:25.260> I'm<00:00:26.160> not<00:00:26.369> quite<00:00:26.640> sure<00:00:26.810> what

00:00:27.800 --> 00:00:27.810 
giant twist I'm not quite sure what

00:00:27.810 --> 00:00:29.509 
giant twist I'm not quite sure what
model<00:00:28.170> it<00:00:28.289> is<00:00:28.380> I<00:00:28.500> think<00:00:28.560> it's<00:00:28.830> twist<00:00:29.099> freedom

00:00:29.509 --> 00:00:29.519 
model it is I think it's twist freedom

00:00:29.519 --> 00:00:32.060 
model it is I think it's twist freedom
but<00:00:29.849> I'm<00:00:29.939> not<00:00:30.060> positive<00:00:30.269> it's<00:00:31.260> got<00:00:31.650> front

00:00:32.060 --> 00:00:32.070 
but I'm not positive it's got front

00:00:32.070 --> 00:00:35.060 
but I'm not positive it's got front
shocks<00:00:32.489> which<00:00:33.390> are<00:00:33.570> very<00:00:33.750> very<00:00:33.930> cool<00:00:34.170> they're

00:00:35.060 --> 00:00:35.070 
shocks which are very very cool they're

00:00:35.070 --> 00:00:40.310 
shocks which are very very cool they're
adjustable<00:00:36.469> and<00:00:37.469> it's<00:00:38.309> a<00:00:38.430> hybrid<00:00:39.140> bicycle<00:00:40.140> as

00:00:40.310 --> 00:00:40.320 
adjustable and it's a hybrid bicycle as

pretty much the same as a standard

00:00:53.460 --> 00:00:56.779 
pretty much the same as a standard
bicycle<00:00:53.699> I<00:00:54.920> decided<00:00:55.920> I'd<00:00:56.160> make<00:00:56.340> a<00:00:56.370> video<00:00:56.579> on

00:00:56.779 --> 00:00:56.789 
bicycle I decided I'd make a video on

00:00:56.789 --> 00:01:00.049 
bicycle I decided I'd make a video on
this<00:00:57.120> because<00:00:58.039> pretty<00:00:59.039> much<00:00:59.250> the<00:00:59.520> only<00:00:59.550> video

00:01:00.049 --> 00:01:00.059 
this because pretty much the only video

00:01:00.059 --> 00:01:02.810 
this because pretty much the only video
showing<00:01:00.480> a<00:01:00.660> giant<00:01:01.079> electric<00:01:01.620> bike<00:01:01.859> were<00:01:02.609> in

mounts I just took it off the charger so
I<00:01:25.380> haven't<00:01:25.560> quite<00:01:25.890> put<00:01:26.250> that<00:01:26.460> in<00:01:26.640> there<00:01:26.790> yet

00:01:30.580 --> 00:01:30.590 

00:01:30.590 --> 00:01:35.600 

imagine<00:01:31.590> the<00:01:31.650> controller<00:01:32.130> is<00:01:32.430> there<00:01:34.610> have

00:01:35.600 --> 00:01:35.610 
imagine the controller is there have

00:01:35.610 --> 00:01:38.240 
imagine the controller is there have
some<00:01:35.909> important<00:01:36.590> bike<00:01:37.590> stuff<00:01:37.950> there<00:01:38.159> are

00:01:38.240 --> 00:01:38.250 
some important bike stuff there are

00:01:38.250 --> 00:01:56.690

goodness

00:02:11.100 --> 00:02:11.110 

00:02:11.110 --> 00:02:12.930 

I'm<00:02:11.590> an<00:02:11.740> amateur<00:02:12.070> and<00:02:12.310> you've<00:02:12.430> never<00:02:12.610> really

00:02:12.930 --> 00:02:12.940 
I'm an amateur and you've never really

00:02:12.940 --> 00:02:14.820 
I'm an amateur and you've never really
put<00:02:13.150> this<00:02:13.240> in<00:02:13.450> before<00:02:13.810> so<00:02:14.020> don't<00:02:14.080> laugh<00:02:14.350> at<00:02:14.620> me

00:02:14.820 --> 00:02:14.830 
put this in before so don't laugh at me

00:02:14.830 --> 00:02:21.350 
put this in before so don't laugh at me
if<00:02:14.950> it<00:02:15.100> doesn't<00:02:15.190> go<00:02:15.460> too<00:02:15.520> smooth

00:02:21.350 --> 00:02:21.360 

00:02:21.360 --> 00:02:27.170 

there<00:02:22.360> we<00:02:22.450> go<00:02:22.630> it's<00:02:22.870> locked<00:02:23.110> into<00:02:23.320> place

00:02:27.170 --> 00:02:27.180 

00:02:27.180 --> 00:02:29.869 

so<00:02:27.780> as<00:02:27.930> I<00:02:28.019> said<00:02:28.080> the<00:02:28.319> controller<00:02:28.709> here<00:02:29.040> has<00:02:29.610> an

00:02:29.869 --> 00:02:29.879 
so as I said the controller here has an

00:02:29.879 --> 00:02:32.509 
so as I said the controller here has an
on<00:02:30.120> button<00:02:30.830> it's<00:02:31.830> going<00:02:32.010> to<00:02:32.069> show<00:02:32.250> you<00:02:32.310> the

00:02:32.509 --> 00:02:32.519 
on button it's going to show you the

00:02:32.519 --> 00:02:33.800 
on button it's going to show you the
current<00:02:32.700> state<00:02:33.060> of<00:02:33.090> the<00:02:33.239> battery<00:02:33.629> and<00:02:33.720> then

00:02:33.800 --> 00:02:33.810 
current state of the battery and then

00:02:33.810 --> 00:02:35.270 
current state of the battery and then
you<00:02:33.959> have<00:02:34.080> different<00:02:34.440> modes<00:02:34.680> here<00:02:34.980> there's

00:02:35.270 --> 00:02:35.280 
you have different modes here there's

00:02:35.280 --> 00:02:37.880 
you have different modes here there's
eco<00:02:35.790> normal<00:02:36.060> and<00:02:36.390> sport<00:02:36.690> sports<00:02:37.620> going<00:02:37.799> to

00:02:37.880 --> 00:02:37.890 
eco normal and sport sports going to

00:02:37.890 --> 00:02:39.619 
eco normal and sport sports going to
give<00:02:38.010> you<00:02:38.099> the<00:02:38.190> most<00:02:38.340> power<00:02:38.610> but<00:02:38.940> also<00:02:39.060> you're

00:02:39.619 --> 00:02:39.629 
give you the most power but also you're

00:02:39.629 --> 00:02:42.550 
give you the most power but also you're
going<00:02:39.780> to<00:02:39.840> see<00:02:39.989> the<00:02:40.140> shortest<00:02:40.620> battery<00:02:40.950> life<00:02:41.159> I

00:02:42.550 --> 00:02:42.560 
going to see the shortest battery life I

00:02:42.560 --> 00:02:44.930 
going to see the shortest battery life I
like<00:02:43.560> to<00:02:43.709> use<00:02:43.860> it<00:02:44.040> because<00:02:44.069> it<00:02:44.250> takes<00:02:44.730> off

00:02:44.930 --> 00:02:44.940 
like to use it because it takes off

00:02:44.940 --> 00:02:46.940 
like to use it because it takes off
pretty<00:02:45.209> quick<00:02:45.450> seems<00:02:46.260> like<00:02:46.379> I<00:02:46.470> can<00:02:46.650> only<00:02:46.769> do<00:02:46.920> it

00:02:46.940 --> 00:02:46.950 
pretty quick seems like I can only do it

00:02:46.950 --> 00:02:53.240 
pretty quick seems like I can only do it
my<00:02:47.159> foot<00:02:50.360> like<00:02:51.360> that<00:02:51.690> I<00:02:52.079> guess<00:02:52.769> it's<00:02:52.950> because<00:02:53.069> I

00:02:53.240 --> 00:02:53.250 
my foot like that I guess it's because I

00:02:53.250 --> 00:02:57.949 
my foot like that I guess it's because I
wasn't<00:02:53.610> pushing<00:02:53.730> hard<00:02:54.060> enough<00:02:56.540> and<00:02:57.540> off<00:02:57.780> it

00:02:57.949 --> 00:02:57.959 
wasn't pushing hard enough and off it

goes all by itself this electric motor
doesn't<00:03:00.840> really<00:03:01.079> provide<00:03:01.640> it<00:03:02.640> doesn't<00:03:02.970> really

00:03:03.080 --> 00:03:03.090 
doesn't really provide it doesn't really

give<00:03:03.299> you<00:03:03.420> that<00:03:03.480> much<00:03:03.810> resistance<00:03:04.200> you<00:03:04.650> pick

00:03:05.479 --> 00:03:05.489 
give you that much resistance you pick

00:03:05.489 --> 00:03:07.339 
give you that much resistance you pick
up<00:03:05.609> the<00:03:05.730> front<00:03:05.910> of<00:03:06.030> the<00:03:06.120> bike<00:03:06.329> you<00:03:06.660> see<00:03:07.200> the

00:03:07.339 --> 00:03:07.349 
up the front of the bike you see the

00:03:07.349 --> 00:03:09.170 
up the front of the bike you see the
tire<00:03:07.530> still<00:03:07.920> spins<00:03:08.250> like<00:03:08.459> a<00:03:08.519> regular<00:03:08.970> bike

00:03:09.170 --> 00:03:09.180 
tire still spins like a regular bike

00:03:09.180 --> 00:03:11.420 
tire still spins like a regular bike
although<00:03:10.170> it<00:03:10.290> does<00:03:10.470> make<00:03:10.500> an<00:03:10.799> annoying<00:03:11.160> noise

00:03:11.420 --> 00:03:11.430 
although it does make an annoying noise

although it does make an annoying noise
that<00:03:11.700> other<00:03:11.940> bikes<00:03:12.239> don't<00:03:12.690> do
