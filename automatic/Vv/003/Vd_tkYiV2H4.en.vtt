but with threes so we're gonna go one
two<00:02:10.390> now<00:02:10.869> by<00:02:11.019> the<00:02:11.080> way<00:02:11.230> that<00:02:11.440> does<00:02:11.680> for<00:02:11.860> no

00:02:11.940 --> 00:02:11.950 
two now by the way that does for no

two now by the way that does for no
strings<00:02:12.220> for<00:02:13.180> not<00:02:13.300> picking<00:02:13.450> you<00:02:13.750> might<00:02:13.870> want

00:02:14.040 --> 00:02:14.050 
strings for not picking you might want

00:02:14.050 --> 00:02:15.540 
strings for not picking you might want
to<00:02:14.080> start<00:02:14.290> that<00:02:14.470> for<00:02:14.800> extra<00:02:15.190> work<00:02:15.310> a<00:02:15.459> little

to start that for extra work a little
bit<00:02:15.700> more<00:02:15.880> difficult<00:02:16.269> struggling<00:02:16.690> upstroke

00:02:17.160 --> 00:02:17.170 
bit more difficult struggling upstroke

00:02:17.170 --> 00:02:20.790 
bit more difficult struggling upstroke

00:02:27.750 --> 00:02:27.760 
string you want to rockin those up

00:02:27.760 --> 00:02:30.539 
string you want to rockin those up
strokes<00:02:28.030> alright<00:02:28.959> so<00:02:29.170> the<00:02:29.530> next<00:02:29.560> one<00:02:29.950> is<00:02:30.130> three

00:02:30.539 --> 00:02:30.549 
strokes alright so the next one is three

like this you know take it away off the
fretboard<00:03:09.380> you're<00:03:09.650> not<00:03:09.770> gonna<00:03:09.860> get<00:03:10.040> very<00:03:10.070> fast

00:03:10.450 --> 00:03:10.460 
fretboard you're not gonna get very fast

00:03:10.460 --> 00:03:14.470 
fretboard you're not gonna get very fast
that<00:03:11.830> wouldn't<00:03:12.830> make<00:03:13.220> it<00:03:13.250> as<00:03:13.520> small<00:03:14.420> as

00:03:14.470 --> 00:03:14.480 
that wouldn't make it as small as

00:03:14.480 --> 00:03:20.470 
that wouldn't make it as small as
possible<00:03:17.830> alright<00:03:19.000> now<00:03:20.000> I'm<00:03:20.060> going<00:03:20.209> to<00:03:20.330> raise

00:03:20.470 --> 00:03:20.480 
possible alright now I'm going to raise

00:03:20.480 --> 00:03:21.940 
possible alright now I'm going to raise
the<00:03:20.690> difficulty<00:03:21.050> level<00:03:21.320> just<00:03:21.530> a<00:03:21.590> little<00:03:21.800> bit

00:03:21.940 --> 00:03:21.950 
the difficulty level just a little bit

00:03:21.950 --> 00:03:25.030 
the difficulty level just a little bit
it's<00:03:22.160> gonna<00:03:22.250> work<00:03:22.430> on<00:03:22.610> shifting<00:03:23.260> so<00:03:24.260> we're

00:03:25.030 --> 00:03:25.040 
it's gonna work on shifting so we're

00:03:25.040 --> 00:03:26.560 
it's gonna work on shifting so we're
going<00:03:25.130> to<00:03:25.190> take<00:03:25.340> the<00:03:25.580> exercises<00:03:26.090> we<00:03:26.209> just<00:03:26.390> did

going to take the exercises we just did
but<00:03:26.870> instead<00:03:27.020> of<00:03:27.290> always<00:03:27.560> staying<00:03:27.650> on<00:03:28.010> the

00:03:28.060 --> 00:03:28.070 
but instead of always staying on the

00:03:28.070 --> 00:03:30.850 
but instead of always staying on the
same<00:03:28.280> fret<00:03:28.700> we're<00:03:29.690> going<00:03:29.840> to<00:03:29.900> pick<00:03:30.080> we'll<00:03:30.770> go

00:03:30.850 --> 00:03:30.860 
same fret we're going to pick we'll go

00:03:30.860 --> 00:03:32.680 
same fret we're going to pick we'll go
back<00:03:31.040> to<00:03:31.160> the<00:03:31.280> four<00:03:31.550> notes<00:03:31.730> here<00:03:32.300> so<00:03:32.330> it's

00:03:32.680 --> 00:03:32.690 
back to the four notes here so it's

00:03:32.690 --> 00:03:35.500 
back to the four notes here so it's
going<00:03:32.780> to<00:03:32.870> be<00:03:32.930> down<00:03:33.050> up<00:03:33.200> down<00:03:33.380> up<00:03:34.420> when<00:03:35.420> you

00:03:39.280 --> 00:03:39.290 
pick that go to the next string but move

00:03:39.290 --> 00:03:46.620 
pick that go to the next string but move
up<00:03:39.410> a<00:03:39.500> fret<00:03:39.680> as<00:03:39.800> well

00:03:46.620 --> 00:03:46.630 

00:03:46.630 --> 00:03:49.570

when you're going across back down the

00:03:51.650 --> 00:03:55.630 
when you're going across back down the
strings<00:03:52.450> still<00:03:53.450> keep<00:03:53.660> you<00:03:53.750> ascending<00:03:54.640> take

00:03:55.630 --> 00:03:55.640 
strings still keep you ascending take

00:03:55.640 --> 00:04:01.950 
strings still keep you ascending take
you're<00:03:55.790> going<00:03:59.230> still<00:04:00.230> gonna<00:04:00.380> bet<00:04:00.800> each<00:04:00.920> time

00:04:01.950 --> 00:04:01.960 
you're going still gonna bet each time

00:04:01.960 --> 00:04:04.030 
you're going still gonna bet each time
when<00:04:02.960> you<00:04:02.990> get<00:04:03.110> up<00:04:03.230> you're<00:04:03.380> used<00:04:03.530> to<00:04:03.590> end<00:04:03.800> up<00:04:03.860> at

00:04:04.030 --> 00:04:04.040 
when you get up you're used to end up at

00:04:04.040 --> 00:04:05.310 
when you get up you're used to end up at
the<00:04:04.070> eleven<00:04:04.520> twelve<00:04:04.820> thirteen<00:04:05.180> fourteen

00:04:05.310 --> 00:04:05.320 
the eleven twelve thirteen fourteen

00:04:05.320 --> 00:04:09.460 
the eleven twelve thirteen fourteen
repeat<00:04:06.320> that<00:04:07.000> and<00:04:08.000> go<00:04:08.180> back<00:04:08.420> up<00:04:08.450> which<00:04:09.230> means

00:04:09.460 --> 00:04:09.470 
repeat that and go back up which means

00:04:09.470 --> 00:04:18.980 
repeat that and go back up which means
you're<00:04:09.950> going<00:04:10.250> down<00:04:10.490> a<00:04:10.520> fret<00:04:10.820> now

00:04:18.980 --> 00:04:18.990 

00:04:18.990 --> 00:04:22.820 

now<00:04:19.990> we<00:04:20.050> did<00:04:20.260> all<00:04:20.410> those<00:04:20.620> with<00:04:20.890> just<00:04:20.920> a<00:04:21.370> basic

00:04:22.820 --> 00:04:22.830 
now we did all those with just a basic

00:04:22.830 --> 00:04:25.770 
now we did all those with just a basic
icing<00:04:23.830> pattern<00:04:24.490> so<00:04:24.670> now<00:04:24.850> let's<00:04:25.450> do<00:04:25.540> the<00:04:25.660> same

00:04:25.770 --> 00:04:25.780 
icing pattern so now let's do the same

00:04:25.780 --> 00:04:27.360 
icing pattern so now let's do the same
exercise<00:04:26.260> but<00:04:26.470> was<00:04:26.590> decent<00:04:26.950> it's<00:04:27.130> a<00:04:27.160> little

00:04:27.360 --> 00:04:27.370 
exercise but was decent it's a little

00:04:27.370 --> 00:04:28.380 
exercise but was decent it's a little
bit<00:04:27.490> more<00:04:27.580> difficult<00:04:27.970> because<00:04:28.030> you<00:04:28.150> got<00:04:28.300> to

00:04:28.380 --> 00:04:28.390 
bit more difficult because you got to

00:04:28.390 --> 00:04:36.480 
bit more difficult because you got to
jump<00:04:28.570> with<00:04:29.290> your<00:04:29.440> pinkie<00:04:29.770> so<00:04:29.980> we<00:04:30.100> go<00:04:30.190> I<00:04:35.370> have<00:04:36.370> to

00:04:36.480 --> 00:04:36.490 
jump with your pinkie so we go I have to

00:04:36.490 --> 00:04:37.890 
jump with your pinkie so we go I have to
lift<00:04:36.730> slightly<00:04:37.180> with<00:04:37.330> your<00:04:37.450> thumb<00:04:37.660> in<00:04:37.810> the

00:04:37.890 --> 00:04:37.900 
lift slightly with your thumb in the

00:04:37.900 --> 00:04:47.330 
lift slightly with your thumb in the
back<00:04:37.930> we<00:04:38.260> never<00:04:38.440> used<00:04:38.590> to<00:04:38.620> change<00:04:38.830> positions

00:04:47.330 --> 00:04:47.340 

00:04:47.340 --> 00:04:57.390 

repeat<00:04:48.340> it<00:04:48.490> at<00:04:48.640> the<00:04:48.730> bottom<00:04:55.980> really<00:04:56.980> helps<00:04:57.280> you

00:04:57.390 --> 00:04:57.400 
repeat it at the bottom really helps you

00:04:57.400 --> 00:04:58.800 
repeat it at the bottom really helps you
start<00:04:57.730> moving<00:04:57.910> around<00:04:58.120> the<00:04:58.390> neck<00:04:58.540> a<00:04:58.750> little

00:04:58.800 --> 00:04:58.810 
start moving around the neck a little

00:04:58.810 --> 00:05:01.530 
start moving around the neck a little
bit<00:04:59.320> easier<00:04:59.680> working<00:05:00.430> on<00:05:00.520> that<00:05:00.670> shifting<00:05:01.030> do

00:05:01.530 --> 00:05:01.540 
bit easier working on that shifting do

00:05:01.540 --> 00:05:08.160 
bit easier working on that shifting do
the<00:05:01.690> same<00:05:01.840> thing<00:05:02.050> now<00:05:02.230> with<00:05:02.260> the<00:05:02.620> threes<00:05:07.170> every

00:05:08.160 --> 00:05:08.170 
the same thing now with the threes every

00:05:08.170 --> 00:05:09.600 
the same thing now with the threes every
time<00:05:08.290> you<00:05:08.380> change<00:05:08.500> a<00:05:08.620> string<00:05:08.740> you<00:05:09.010> shift<00:05:09.370> up<00:05:09.460> a

00:05:09.600 --> 00:05:09.610 
time you change a string you shift up a

00:05:09.610 --> 00:05:23.520 
time you change a string you shift up a
fret<00:05:09.850> oh<00:05:10.140> yeah<00:05:21.450> alright<00:05:22.450> then<00:05:22.810> descending

00:05:23.520 --> 00:05:23.530 
fret oh yeah alright then descending

00:05:23.530 --> 00:05:33.240 
fret oh yeah alright then descending
with<00:05:23.650> that

00:05:33.240 --> 00:05:33.250 

00:05:33.250 --> 00:05:35.140 

all<00:05:34.250> right<00:05:34.370> you<00:05:34.550> want<00:05:34.669> a<00:05:34.699> little<00:05:34.879> added

00:05:35.140 --> 00:05:35.150 
all right you want a little added

00:05:35.150 --> 00:05:37.689 
all right you want a little added
difficulty<00:05:35.419> do<00:05:36.169> it<00:05:36.409> with<00:05:36.680> these<00:05:37.430> three

00:05:37.689 --> 00:05:37.699 
difficulty do it with these three
