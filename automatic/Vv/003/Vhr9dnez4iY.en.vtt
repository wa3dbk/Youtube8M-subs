00:03:19.180 --> 00:03:19.190 
I have a history of been making hit

00:03:19.190 --> 00:03:20.470 
I have a history of been making hit
records<00:03:19.220> so<00:03:19.670> I<00:03:19.700> have<00:03:19.850> it<00:03:20.000> I<00:03:20.060> have<00:03:20.090> a<00:03:20.239> story

00:03:20.470 --> 00:03:20.480 
records so I have it I have a story

00:03:20.480 --> 00:03:23.050 
records so I have it I have a story
behind<00:03:20.720> me<00:03:20.959> have<00:03:21.079> a<00:03:21.110> following<00:03:21.530> so<00:03:22.040> I<00:03:22.340> think

00:03:23.050 --> 00:03:23.060 
behind me have a following so I think

00:03:23.060 --> 00:03:24.370 
behind me have a following so I think
it's<00:03:23.329> important<00:03:23.660> for<00:03:23.720> artists<00:03:23.989> to<00:03:24.019> build<00:03:24.290> a

00:03:24.370 --> 00:03:24.380 
it's important for artists to build a

00:03:24.380 --> 00:03:26.350 
it's important for artists to build a
following<00:03:24.739> and<00:03:24.980> paid<00:03:25.160> them<00:03:25.340> waiting<00:03:25.670> tour<00:03:26.060> and

00:03:26.350 --> 00:03:26.360 
following and paid them waiting tour and

00:03:26.360 --> 00:03:28.060 
following and paid them waiting tour and
get<00:03:26.450> to<00:03:26.570> know<00:03:26.690> people<00:03:27.079> and<00:03:27.110> put<00:03:27.290> on<00:03:27.380> records<00:03:27.709> so

00:03:28.060 --> 00:03:28.070 
get to know people and put on records so

00:03:28.070 --> 00:03:29.830 
get to know people and put on records so
that<00:03:28.100> people<00:03:28.459> can<00:03:28.579> get<00:03:28.700> familiar<00:03:29.030> with<00:03:29.120> Julio

00:03:29.830 --> 00:03:29.840 
that people can get familiar with Julio

00:03:29.840 --> 00:03:31.509 
that people can get familiar with Julio
so<00:03:30.200> then<00:03:30.320> when<00:03:30.410> you<00:03:30.470> do<00:03:30.620> attack<00:03:30.950> radio<00:03:31.340> with<00:03:31.489> a

00:03:31.509 --> 00:03:31.519 
so then when you do attack radio with a

00:03:31.519 --> 00:03:33.729 
so then when you do attack radio with a
record<00:03:31.760> it's<00:03:32.269> more<00:03:32.450> of<00:03:32.540> a<00:03:32.630> story<00:03:32.930> as<00:03:33.170> opposed

00:03:33.729 --> 00:03:33.739 
record it's more of a story as opposed

00:03:33.739 --> 00:03:35.410 
record it's more of a story as opposed
to<00:03:33.890> just<00:03:33.920> oh<00:03:34.370> that's<00:03:34.820> the<00:03:34.910> girl<00:03:34.940> who<00:03:35.180> was<00:03:35.269> on

00:03:35.410 --> 00:03:35.420 
to just oh that's the girl who was on

00:03:35.420 --> 00:03:37.120 
to just oh that's the girl who was on
the<00:03:35.450> wild<00:03:35.720> a<00:03:35.810> wreck<00:03:35.989> I<00:03:36.260> don't<00:03:36.650> want<00:03:36.769> that<00:03:36.829> to<00:03:37.010> be

00:03:37.120 --> 00:03:37.130 
the wild a wreck I don't want that to be

00:03:37.130 --> 00:03:38.830 
the wild a wreck I don't want that to be
her<00:03:37.250> story<00:03:37.579> I<00:03:37.700> wanted<00:03:38.060> to<00:03:38.120> I<00:03:38.299> wanted<00:03:38.329> to<00:03:38.660> build

00:03:38.830 --> 00:03:38.840 
her story I wanted to I wanted to build

00:03:38.840 --> 00:03:40.509 
her story I wanted to I wanted to build
our<00:03:38.959> own<00:03:39.019> story<00:03:39.440> and<00:03:39.769> then<00:03:40.070> when<00:03:40.190> we<00:03:40.220> dropped

00:03:40.509 --> 00:03:40.519 
our own story and then when we dropped

00:03:40.519 --> 00:03:42.759 
our own story and then when we dropped
the<00:03:40.640> record<00:03:41.000> he's<00:03:41.510> like<00:03:41.780> a<00:03:41.810> layup<00:03:42.140> you<00:03:42.470> know<00:03:42.590> me

00:03:42.759 --> 00:03:42.769 
the record he's like a layup you know me

00:03:42.769 --> 00:03:45.160 
the record he's like a layup you know me
so<00:03:43.130> it<00:03:43.370> takes<00:03:43.700> a<00:03:43.880> lot<00:03:44.030> of<00:03:44.060> planning<00:03:44.750> and<00:03:44.989> work

00:03:45.160 --> 00:03:45.170 
so it takes a lot of planning and work

00:03:45.170 --> 00:03:46.360 
so it takes a lot of planning and work
you<00:03:45.500> know<00:03:45.590> and<00:03:45.620> that's<00:03:45.890> what<00:03:46.040> we<00:03:46.130> do<00:03:46.250> in
