00:00:08.920 --> 00:00:13.000
 good good good lucasarts 

00:00:11.250 --> 00:00:14.620
 entertainment company 

00:00:13.000 --> 00:00:17.349
 and what is happening to you with these 

00:00:14.620 --> 00:00:21.279
 lately but this this super vintage 

00:00:17.349 --> 00:00:23.950
 uncle this is super vintage very good to 

00:00:21.279 --> 00:00:28.869
 all youtube walkers welcome 

00:00:23.950 --> 00:00:32.710
 here to the game star wars tie fighter 

00:00:28.869 --> 00:00:34.629
 year 95 that you thought that this of 

00:00:32.710 --> 00:00:36.940
 the video games of star wars is new 

00:00:34.629 --> 00:00:39.220
 that they take it out now because the 

00:00:36.940 --> 00:00:41.860
 film and give us all the height 

00:00:39.220 --> 00:00:44.739
 of the world and more we ladies and gentlemen do not 

00:00:41.860 --> 00:00:47.049
 the star wars games and here we see 

00:00:44.739 --> 00:00:49.629
 as I have here a profile created this what 

00:00:47.049 --> 00:00:52.629
 I had to go down because obviously 

00:00:49.629 --> 00:00:54.699
 this game is discontinued I would say 

00:00:52.629 --> 00:00:57.220
 through a ms-two emulator in 

00:00:54.699 --> 00:00:59.799
 good windows in an authentic odyssey 

00:00:57.220 --> 00:01:03.190
 to make it work and here we are is 

00:00:59.799 --> 00:01:05.640
 a flight simulator of the empire 

00:01:03.190 --> 00:01:08.110
 in this game we're just going to play 

00:01:05.640 --> 00:01:10.570
 space battles and we're going to do it 

00:01:08.110 --> 00:01:12.700
 with the faction of the bad guys so 

00:01:10.570 --> 00:01:14.890
 say it we are a soldier 

00:01:12.700 --> 00:01:17.200
 imperial and as we go 

00:01:14.890 --> 00:01:18.670
 progressing in our missions that we 

00:01:17.200 --> 00:01:21.939
 are going to be entrusted our 

00:01:18.670 --> 00:01:24.070
 higher we will go ascending from 

00:01:21.939 --> 00:01:26.229
 rank even in the last missions 

00:01:24.070 --> 00:01:27.820
 the campaign mode in campaign mode 

00:01:26.229 --> 00:01:29.500
 say something because it is the only way to 

00:01:27.820 --> 00:01:33.549
 done or there is no online mode we are 

00:01:29.500 --> 00:01:35.710
 speaking of the year 95 then and even to 

00:01:33.549 --> 00:01:38.679
 as we go up in rank and 

00:01:35.710 --> 00:01:42.399
 completing our missions we can 

00:01:38.679 --> 00:01:45.840
 even fight hand in hand with one's own 

00:01:42.399 --> 00:01:49.270
 darth vader anakin skywalker darth vader 

00:01:45.840 --> 00:01:50.470
 hand in hand on missions already from the most 

00:01:49.270 --> 00:01:53.110
 high level 

00:01:50.470 --> 00:01:55.899
 the mechanics is quite similar to the 

00:01:53.110 --> 00:01:58.630
 what you see basically appeared in the middle 

00:01:55.899 --> 00:02:00.939
 of space through the ship 's 

00:01:58.630 --> 00:02:03.729
 hyperspace whatever it was for 

00:02:00.939 --> 00:02:05.140
 basically inspect you they said 

00:02:03.729 --> 00:02:07.569
 basically now we can do is 

00:02:05.140 --> 00:02:10.390
 inspect these ships of origin 

00:02:07.569 --> 00:02:12.760
 doubtful not then you got close to 

00:02:10.390 --> 00:02:14.470
 them and if it puts food stop which is what 

00:02:12.760 --> 00:02:16.850
 just appeared because it is a 

00:02:14.470 --> 00:02:19.970
 store or food and such 

00:02:16.850 --> 00:02:23.120
 and finally I think it's onÃ­s 53 

00:02:19.970 --> 00:02:26.000
 I do not know one of these I'm going to put that 

00:02:23.120 --> 00:02:28.730
 it is loaded with rebels, which 

00:02:26.000 --> 00:02:30.950
 we're going to have to shoot 

00:02:28.730 --> 00:02:34.850
 how many missiles and then it's going to come will 

00:02:30.950 --> 00:02:36.980
 come people to us for other ships 

00:02:34.850 --> 00:02:39.350
 that go in their boyfriends, not because 

00:02:36.980 --> 00:02:42.500
 these are cargo transports no no 

00:02:39.350 --> 00:02:45.350
 they have no weapons we arrived 

00:02:42.500 --> 00:02:46.490
 a tie fighter is the typical ship if not 

00:02:45.350 --> 00:02:48.530
 I 'm going to put an image now 

00:02:46.490 --> 00:02:51.170
 superimposed on the typical ship of the empire 

00:02:48.530 --> 00:02:53.450
 not tiny very fast armed after 

00:02:51.170 --> 00:02:55.790
 eyebrows not with cannons there were several types 

00:02:53.450 --> 00:02:57.800
 of cannons and such and clear for you 

00:02:55.790 --> 00:03:00.080
 what are you seeing now I'm going to 

00:02:57.800 --> 00:03:01.940
 say small fruit shit that uses 

00:03:00.080 --> 00:03:04.790
 this is what we are talking about 

00:03:01.940 --> 00:03:07.240
 20 years 20 years ago these graphics 

00:03:04.790 --> 00:03:09.910
 although you see it polygonal 

00:03:07.240 --> 00:03:11.800
 It was a real breakthrough in these 

00:03:09.910 --> 00:03:13.930
 graphics come from the hand of the 

00:03:11.800 --> 00:03:16.420
 lucasarts company that are the same 

00:03:13.930 --> 00:03:17.830
 how good they were 

00:03:16.420 --> 00:03:18.880
 obviously in the development of 

00:03:17.830 --> 00:03:22.750
 special effects 

00:03:18.880 --> 00:03:24.700
 of the star wars saga and basically 

00:03:22.750 --> 00:03:26.320
 the results were quite powerful 

00:03:24.700 --> 00:03:28.960
 Obviously this was a game of 

00:03:26.320 --> 00:03:31.000
 pc only work for pc besides I was going to 

00:03:28.960 --> 00:03:34.060
 via diskettes then yes it 

00:03:31.000 --> 00:03:36.370
 remastered after 45 years grants 

00:03:34.060 --> 00:03:39.490
 because the diskettes were already anticipated 

00:03:36.370 --> 00:03:42.310
 would die and such and now is a game 

00:03:39.490 --> 00:03:45.580
 which is obviously discontinued and 

00:03:42.310 --> 00:03:47.290
 it works under emulator and in this mission 

00:03:45.580 --> 00:03:49.540
 specifically it is the first of the way 

00:03:47.290 --> 00:03:51.850
 campaign is relatively easy but not 

00:03:49.540 --> 00:03:54.610
 it was an easy game not basically because 

00:03:51.850 --> 00:03:57.910
 Well the operation of it is a 

00:03:54.610 --> 00:03:59.830
 through mouse keyboard not then 

00:03:57.910 --> 00:04:02.170
 you had to intercept a series of 

00:03:59.830 --> 00:04:05.020
 ships are often very fast they 

00:04:02.170 --> 00:04:07.270
 move a lot is very anti and lubia not 

00:04:05.020 --> 00:04:09.520
 but it reminds me of the air combats 

00:04:07.270 --> 00:04:11.000
 of debate filters not in fact when 

00:04:09.520 --> 00:04:13.550
 played 

00:04:11.000 --> 00:04:15.440
 on the jets and so debate 

00:04:13.550 --> 00:04:18.170
 filtres reminded me a lot about it 

00:04:15.440 --> 00:04:21.290
 truth what I would most emphasize about this 

00:04:18.170 --> 00:04:24.140
 series of games and such is evidently 

00:04:21.290 --> 00:04:26.330
 the fact of being a fan of the saga as 

00:04:24.140 --> 00:04:27.920
 I already told you in the previous video maybe 

00:04:26.330 --> 00:04:29.930
 It was a facet that you did not know about me 

00:04:27.920 --> 00:04:31.970
 because obviously in recent years 

00:04:29.930 --> 00:04:34.310
 Well, it did not happen a little what was coming 

00:04:31.970 --> 00:04:36.740
 going through this time not in the year 

00:04:34.310 --> 00:04:39.560
 95 was beginning to be rumored not that 

00:04:36.740 --> 00:04:41.510
 maybe they would start making new 

00:04:39.560 --> 00:04:44.090
 Star wars movies were not yet known to 

00:04:41.510 --> 00:04:45.980
 true science if they would be prequels like 

00:04:44.090 --> 00:04:48.800
 if they were or would advance in history 

00:04:45.980 --> 00:04:51.290
 as in the case that we will start to see 

00:04:48.800 --> 00:04:53.330
 this year from Christmas and 

00:04:51.290 --> 00:04:55.370
 we were a little bit orphans and so 

00:04:53.330 --> 00:04:57.530
 louis and these video games that are going 

00:04:55.370 --> 00:05:00.440
 taking out are also professors are 

00:04:57.530 --> 00:05:02.690
 he called ex wing usa was pretty 

00:05:00.440 --> 00:05:04.320
 looked albeit graphically a bit 

00:05:02.690 --> 00:05:06.900
 less 

00:05:04.320 --> 00:05:09.000
 or see power here this was pretty web 

00:05:06.900 --> 00:05:10.590
 power for the time I repeat then the 

00:05:09.000 --> 00:05:12.240
 truth is that it was quite a notion but 

00:05:10.590 --> 00:05:14.460
 from the faction of the rebels the 

00:05:12.240 --> 00:05:16.800
 good for you to understand me and the truth 

00:05:14.460 --> 00:05:20.280
 is that the merit a little bit of this kind 

00:05:16.800 --> 00:05:21.960
 of games was the fact of being able to live 

00:05:20.280 --> 00:05:23.610
 experience to star wars at first 

00:05:21.960 --> 00:05:25.710
 person that the graphics are nothing 

00:05:23.610 --> 00:05:28.170
 of this world but for example the fact 

00:05:25.710 --> 00:05:31.230
 to include the original sounds of the 

00:05:28.170 --> 00:05:32.910
 lasers when firing and such the music 

00:05:31.230 --> 00:05:34.710
 Although listen a little a little 

00:05:32.910 --> 00:05:37.280
 plan I gave the midi at that time was 

00:05:34.710 --> 00:05:39.630
 quite the last the last cry not 

00:05:37.280 --> 00:05:41.670
 making the most of the inclusion of 

00:05:39.630 --> 00:05:44.460
 first sound cards the shadow 

00:05:41.670 --> 00:05:46.530
 external at the time never lose of 

00:05:44.460 --> 00:05:49.200
 view that we are talking about 20 years ago 

00:05:46.530 --> 00:05:52.110
 years and for me for a kid like me 

00:05:49.200 --> 00:05:54.780
 12 13 14 years the fact of being able to play 

00:05:52.110 --> 00:05:56.520
 this game not on computer listen to 

00:05:54.780 --> 00:05:58.620
 melodies and music that more than 

00:05:56.520 --> 00:06:01.230
 so much you sounded the sounds of 

00:05:58.620 --> 00:06:03.090
 ships passing by you at 

00:06:01.230 --> 00:06:05.820
 characteristic of star wars that sound 

00:06:03.090 --> 00:06:09.020
 the sound of lasers the fact 

00:06:05.820 --> 00:06:11.670
 power to put shields 

00:06:09.020 --> 00:06:13.350
 deflectors to stop so that 

00:06:11.670 --> 00:06:15.240
 enemy lasers did not make you so much 

00:06:13.350 --> 00:06:17.070
 damage although in this mission I also do not 

00:06:15.240 --> 00:06:20.040
 mine hero do not get to shoot me much 

00:06:17.070 --> 00:06:21.840
 basically it's in the sense that of 

00:06:20.040 --> 00:06:23.160
 that was the first one is not the first 

00:06:21.840 --> 00:06:25.680
 mission but it really was a game 

00:06:23.160 --> 00:06:28.980
 quite complicated and the truth is that 

00:06:25.680 --> 00:06:31.020
 this is very very antidiluvian more than 

00:06:28.980 --> 00:06:32.670
 I do not think I can trace no 

00:06:31.020 --> 00:06:34.770
 because the x wings did not finish me 

00:06:32.670 --> 00:06:36.360
 work I've been testing it and the 

00:06:34.770 --> 00:06:38.430
 truth is that I did not play many x 

00:06:36.360 --> 00:06:40.620
 I was very excited to play this 

00:06:38.430 --> 00:06:43.200
 this tie fighter although obviously 

00:06:40.620 --> 00:06:45.270
 with distance I am the one who 

00:06:43.200 --> 00:06:48.570
 I say that decreases difference 

00:06:45.270 --> 00:06:51.390
 be the truth is that today we are not going 

00:06:48.570 --> 00:06:53.040
 they have nothing to do if the few 

00:06:51.390 --> 00:06:55.830
 images that we have seen of combats 

00:06:53.040 --> 00:06:58.560
 Spacers in the new battle force 

00:06:55.830 --> 00:07:00.840
 where are you going, it's not that you get a thousand 

00:06:58.560 --> 00:07:02.940
 turns to this is that they really seem 

00:07:00.840 --> 00:07:04.410
 Movie scenes may be 

00:07:02.940 --> 00:07:07.680
 cinematic but good the fact that 

00:07:04.410 --> 00:07:09.810
 I repeat the graphic engine of the game has 

00:07:07.680 --> 00:07:11.490
 been implemented to make them makes us 

00:07:09.810 --> 00:07:13.540
 see a little bit what will be a little bit 

00:07:11.490 --> 00:07:15.550
 level of those space battles 

00:07:13.540 --> 00:07:18.340
 So many of you delighted me 

00:07:15.550 --> 00:07:20.770
 generation through the ex wing series 

00:07:18.340 --> 00:07:23.380
 or this incredible huge fighter tie 

00:07:20.770 --> 00:07:25.450
 come on I'm speechless nothing was 

00:07:23.380 --> 00:07:29.080
 just a little bit so you could see a little 

00:07:25.450 --> 00:07:32.050
 operation of this type of games 

00:07:29.080 --> 00:07:34.120
 from now we can call me grandfather 

00:07:32.050 --> 00:07:36.220
 chive and such but I'm sure that 

00:07:34.120 --> 00:07:38.710
 maybe some of you even 

00:07:36.220 --> 00:07:41.650
 Pilla be very young if you could 

00:07:38.710 --> 00:07:44.260
 you could play and if I am already older or 

00:07:41.650 --> 00:07:45.780
 of my age or even more sure that if 

00:07:44.260 --> 00:07:48.250
 you are fans of this saga 

00:07:45.780 --> 00:07:49.750
 you had this game you played it on 

00:07:48.250 --> 00:07:52.210
 a friend's house or something because really 

00:07:49.750 --> 00:07:56.370
 quite mythical, nothing more than a 

00:07:52.210 --> 00:07:56.370
 huge hug see you and see you soon
