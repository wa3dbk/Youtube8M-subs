00:00:11.719 --> 00:00:18.539
 metroplex already generically referred to 

00:00:15.379 --> 00:00:22.140
 brt system of Medellin we are 

00:00:18.539 --> 00:00:28.680
 operating between the University of Medellin 

00:00:22.140 --> 00:00:32.189
 aranjuez where is called metro I use it 

00:00:28.680 --> 00:00:35.570
 first by metroplús in the station of 

00:00:32.189 --> 00:00:38.520
 Medellin after the industrial exit 

00:00:35.570 --> 00:00:41.210
 there with transfer to ours and measure and 

00:00:38.520 --> 00:00:41.210
 populated bayern 

00:00:43.570 --> 00:00:52.450
 in the 30 meters in the morning and in the 

00:00:46.090 --> 00:00:56.730
 late even general utility of 

00:00:52.450 --> 00:00:56.730
 system are the working students 

00:00:59.340 --> 00:01:07.590
 and some buses have 20 buses 

00:01:02.949 --> 00:01:13.020
 articulated 160 passenger capacities 

00:01:07.590 --> 00:01:13.020
 we are using vehicular natural gas 

00:01:18.490 --> 00:01:23.409
 transport of mine is the private car 

00:01:21.700 --> 00:01:26.159
 rarely used the system of 

00:01:23.409 --> 00:01:28.960
 metroplús and I found it very interesting 

00:01:26.159 --> 00:01:31.710
 too fast now I have my 

00:01:28.960 --> 00:01:34.440
 plate and then 

00:01:31.710 --> 00:01:36.619
 use being the system and I thought 

00:01:34.440 --> 00:01:36.619
 too 

00:01:41.390 --> 00:01:47.150
 good integration between line 1 of 

00:01:44.060 --> 00:01:49.670
 buses and the subway is through three 

00:01:47.150 --> 00:01:52.220
 integration stations 

00:01:49.670 --> 00:01:54.500
 in the hospital station we have a 

00:01:52.220 --> 00:01:56.400
 physical integration we have another 

00:01:54.500 --> 00:02:00.090
 integration 

00:01:56.400 --> 00:02:01.970
 in the station cisneros and we have 

00:02:00.090 --> 00:02:06.770
 additionally an integration 

00:02:01.970 --> 00:02:06.770
 provisional in the industrial station 

00:02:40.410 --> 00:02:44.880
 I have since I was beautiful have been thirsty 

00:02:42.690 --> 00:02:47.040
 aranjuez living is easy to do 

00:02:44.880 --> 00:02:49.050
 transshipment although there is a lot of cohesion 

00:02:47.040 --> 00:02:51.090
 of people anyway when going down 

00:02:49.050 --> 00:02:54.330
 there is comfort the mind 

00:02:51.090 --> 00:02:56.310
 fast transit in the metro the average 

00:02:54.330 --> 00:02:59.640
 the metro culture applies the people 

00:02:56.310 --> 00:03:02.069
 messy from the rows of the moment 

00:02:59.640 --> 00:03:04.350
 and you have to have some property 

00:03:02.069 --> 00:03:07.680
 from a disabled person to an adult 

00:03:04.350 --> 00:03:10.600
 more than people carry 

00:03:07.680 --> 00:03:12.340
 niece is called Sofia is easy too 

00:03:10.600 --> 00:03:14.500
 to walk with a baby so the 

00:03:12.340 --> 00:03:18.840
 people give one the comfort of a 

00:03:14.500 --> 00:03:18.840
 placed at the time of boarding the subway 

00:03:23.430 --> 00:03:27.840
 a frequency with which we are 

00:03:25.469 --> 00:03:31.079
 providing the service at peak time is 

00:03:27.840 --> 00:03:34.230
 five minutes in the rush hour of the 

00:03:31.079 --> 00:03:40.139
 morning and in the afternoon and in the day is 

00:03:34.230 --> 00:03:43.730
 variable between 8 and 7 minutes and in the 

00:03:40.139 --> 00:03:45.800
 10 minutes night 

00:03:43.730 --> 00:03:47.360
 It has changed our lives because we 

00:03:45.800 --> 00:03:50.360
 we are behind in the transport of 

00:03:47.360 --> 00:03:53.180
 metro and downtown because the 

00:03:50.360 --> 00:03:56.600
 passages had to catch all the 

00:03:53.180 --> 00:03:58.850
 bus service 

00:03:56.600 --> 00:04:01.760
 would be four passes and instead 

00:03:58.850 --> 00:04:05.210
 put yourself in the two passages that would be 

00:04:01.760 --> 00:04:06.730
 of the metro that will go and return that of course 

00:04:05.210 --> 00:04:09.370
 that the service in the afternoon is 

00:04:06.730 --> 00:04:11.270
 very many people very many 

00:04:09.370 --> 00:04:13.790
 as ours what would you 

00:04:11.270 --> 00:04:15.300
 it will pass in the day a little bit faster or 

00:04:13.790 --> 00:04:17.519
 in one of the other 

00:04:15.300 --> 00:04:20.810
 because sometimes so many people are not 

00:04:17.519 --> 00:04:20.810
 we reach to throw 

00:04:30.260 --> 00:04:37.370
 my name is fan tila where my name is 

00:04:34.070 --> 00:04:40.990

00:04:37.370 --> 00:04:43.150
 fascinated the metroplús route 

00:04:40.990 --> 00:04:46.920
 I made a goal opportunity but for 

00:04:43.150 --> 00:04:50.380
 this part of here of aranjuez 

00:04:46.920 --> 00:04:53.290
 that was my interest to know 

00:04:50.380 --> 00:04:57.670
 and is remembered the time I read explaining 

00:04:53.290 --> 00:04:59.980
 where we came for him to remember 

00:04:57.670 --> 00:05:03.190
 because I lived here for many years 

00:04:59.980 --> 00:05:05.740
 to the judge and I want to remember and go back to 

00:05:03.190 --> 00:05:07.330
 go through where I lived porto where I 

00:05:05.740 --> 00:05:12.780

00:05:07.330 --> 00:05:12.780
