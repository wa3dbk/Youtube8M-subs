time that timidity step

00:00:05.790 --> 00:00:08.450 
time that timidity step
you<00:00:05.970> always<00:00:06.150> in<00:00:06.509> that<00:00:06.540> position<00:00:06.960> see<00:00:07.890> let's<00:00:08.340> do

00:00:08.450 --> 00:00:08.460 
you always in that position see let's do

00:00:08.460 --> 00:00:09.680 
you always in that position see let's do
one<00:00:08.610> more<00:00:08.639> time<00:00:08.910> when<00:00:09.179> you<00:00:09.300> sent<00:00:09.540> there

00:00:09.680 --> 00:00:09.690 
one more time when you sent there

one more time when you sent there
backward<00:00:10.080> and<00:00:10.530> now<00:00:11.309> put<00:00:11.519> it<00:00:11.610> forward<00:00:11.849> on<00:00:12.150> the

00:00:12.379 --> 00:00:12.389 
backward and now put it forward on the

00:00:12.389 --> 00:00:15.110 
backward and now put it forward on the
one<00:00:12.540> of<00:00:12.630> the<00:00:12.690> proof<00:00:13.580> which<00:00:14.580> muscle<00:00:15.000> you<00:00:15.089> have

00:00:15.110 --> 00:00:15.120 
one of the proof which muscle you have

00:00:15.120 --> 00:00:17.180 
one of the proof which muscle you have
to<00:00:15.389> hold<00:00:15.570> on<00:00:15.809> to<00:00:16.260> can<00:00:16.529> hold<00:00:16.770> yourself<00:00:16.859> there

00:00:17.180 --> 00:00:17.190 
to hold on to can hold yourself there

00:00:17.190 --> 00:00:39.020 
to hold on to can hold yourself there
one<00:00:17.520> more<00:00:17.640> time<00:00:17.820> back<00:00:19.340> there<00:00:37.850> the<00:00:38.850> only

00:00:39.020 --> 00:00:39.030 
one more time back there the only

00:00:39.030 --> 00:00:41.479 
one more time back there the only
articulation<00:00:39.960> who<00:00:40.200> are<00:00:40.320> bending<00:00:40.920> at<00:00:41.129> the

00:00:41.479 --> 00:00:41.489 
articulation who are bending at the

00:00:41.489 --> 00:00:46.729 
articulation who are bending at the
source<00:00:42.649> the<00:00:43.649> ankle<00:00:44.190> the<00:00:45.059> knee<00:00:45.090> and<00:00:45.629> the<00:00:46.230> elbows

00:00:46.729 --> 00:00:46.739 
source the ankle the knee and the elbows

00:00:46.739 --> 00:00:49.520 
source the ankle the knee and the elbows
so<00:00:47.489> we<00:00:47.670> don't<00:00:47.910> win<00:00:48.149> their<00:00:48.420> upper<00:00:48.719> body<00:00:49.200> we

00:00:49.520 --> 00:00:49.530 
so we don't win their upper body we

00:00:49.530 --> 00:01:03.979 
so we don't win their upper body we
don't<00:00:49.800> inherit<00:01:00.469> balance<00:01:01.469> again<00:01:02.899> until<00:01:03.899> you

00:01:03.979 --> 00:01:03.989 
don't inherit balance again until you

00:01:03.989 --> 00:01:05.719 
don't inherit balance again until you
decide<00:01:04.379> you<00:01:04.559> won<00:01:04.680> at<00:01:04.769> that<00:01:04.949> back<00:01:05.159> or<00:01:05.400> solid
