 twice on the home button and in 

00:02:17.170 --> 00:02:20.860
 sweeping to the left 

00:02:18.160 --> 00:02:22.750
 the continuity function it works too 

00:02:20.860 --> 00:02:24.580
 in the other direction for example you 

00:02:22.750 --> 00:02:25.720
 started writing an email on your 

00:02:24.580 --> 00:02:27.790

00:02:25.720 --> 00:02:30.760

00:02:27.790 --> 00:02:32.830

00:02:37.000 --> 00:02:40.720
 this is for this function undof 

00:02:38.860 --> 00:02:44.020
 continuity in French which therefore allows 

00:02:40.720 --> 00:02:45.760
 to switch very easily from one device 

00:02:44.020 --> 00:02:48.250
 to the other without interrupting what one 

00:02:45.760 --> 00:02:49.870
 is making note that the 

00:02:48.250 --> 00:02:53.350
 function will be available soon 

00:02:49.870 --> 00:02:56.250
 with non apple applications which 

00:02:53.350 --> 00:02:56.250
 will be even more practical
