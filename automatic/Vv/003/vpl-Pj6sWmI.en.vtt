00:00:21.050 --> 00:00:21.060 
last week I was working with an artist

00:00:21.060 --> 00:00:24.380 
last week I was working with an artist
in<00:00:21.539> the<00:00:22.100> workshop<00:00:23.100> all<00:00:23.310> the<00:00:23.430> time<00:00:23.640> and<00:00:23.939> getting

in the workshop all the time and getting

00:00:24.390 --> 00:00:27.529 
in the workshop all the time and getting
to<00:00:24.509> know<00:00:24.539> his<00:00:24.810> project<00:00:25.380> and<00:00:26.029> sort<00:00:27.029> of<00:00:27.210> you<00:00:27.359> get

00:00:27.529 --> 00:00:27.539 
to know his project and sort of you get

00:00:27.539 --> 00:00:31.249 
to know his project and sort of you get
to<00:00:28.050> know<00:00:28.400> exhibitions<00:00:29.400> and<00:00:29.730> people<00:00:30.179> from<00:00:30.449> all

00:00:31.249 --> 00:00:31.259 
to know exhibitions and people from all

00:00:31.259 --> 00:00:36.650 
to know exhibitions and people from all
around<00:00:31.470> the<00:00:31.679> world

00:00:36.650 --> 00:00:36.660 

00:00:36.660 --> 00:00:39.340 

and<00:00:36.900> I<00:00:37.560> have<00:00:37.680> to<00:00:37.800> sign<00:00:37.980> anything<00:00:38.280> o'clock<00:00:38.610> and

00:00:39.340 --> 00:00:39.350 
and I have to sign anything o'clock and

00:00:39.350 --> 00:00:43.310 
and I have to sign anything o'clock and
so<00:00:40.350> it's<00:00:40.530> a<00:00:40.830> clock<00:00:41.520> also<00:00:42.510> a<00:00:42.540> functional<00:00:43.020> clock

00:00:43.310 --> 00:00:43.320 
so it's a clock also a functional clock

00:00:43.320 --> 00:00:45.440 
so it's a clock also a functional clock
where<00:00:43.560> you<00:00:43.620> can<00:00:43.800> read<00:00:43.950> the<00:00:43.980> time<00:00:44.310> but<00:00:44.760> yet<00:00:45.300> the

00:00:45.440 --> 00:00:45.450 
where you can read the time but yet the

00:00:45.450 --> 00:00:48.500 
where you can read the time but yet the
vary<00:00:45.660> quite<00:00:46.590> a<00:00:46.710> approach<00:00:47.220> because<00:00:47.910> what<00:00:48.480> I

00:00:48.500 --> 00:00:48.510 
vary quite a approach because what I

00:00:48.510 --> 00:00:51.530 
vary quite a approach because what I
wanted<00:00:49.140> was<00:00:49.320> to<00:00:49.350> show<00:00:49.710> the<00:00:50.040> nature<00:00:50.580> of<00:00:50.850> time<00:00:51.120> in

00:00:51.530 --> 00:00:51.540 
wanted was to show the nature of time in

00:00:51.540 --> 00:00:56.690 
wanted was to show the nature of time in
a<00:00:51.690> different<00:00:52.020> way

00:00:56.690 --> 00:00:56.700 

00:00:56.700 --> 00:01:00.350 

it<00:00:57.630> was<00:00:57.780> actually<00:00:58.140> a<00:00:58.170> part<00:00:58.380> of<00:00:58.500> my<00:00:58.740> diploma<00:00:59.360> I

00:01:00.350 --> 00:01:00.360 
it was actually a part of my diploma I

00:01:00.360 --> 00:01:02.750 
it was actually a part of my diploma I
did<00:01:00.630> my<00:01:00.780> graduation<00:01:01.260> at<00:01:01.770> the<00:01:02.100> University<00:01:02.700> of

00:01:02.750 --> 00:01:02.760 
did my graduation at the University of

00:01:02.760 --> 00:01:06.650 
did my graduation at the University of
Arts<00:01:03.030> in<00:01:03.210> Berlin<00:01:03.510> yes<00:01:03.990> yes<00:01:04.230> and<00:01:05.390> the<00:01:06.390> diploma

00:01:06.650 --> 00:01:06.660 
Arts in Berlin yes yes and the diploma

00:01:06.660 --> 00:01:09.230 
Arts in Berlin yes yes and the diploma
was<00:01:06.870> called<00:01:07.140> everything<00:01:08.130> counts<00:01:08.400> so<00:01:08.940> I

00:01:09.230 --> 00:01:09.240 
was called everything counts so I

00:01:09.240 --> 00:01:11.630 
was called everything counts so I
started<00:01:09.600> off<00:01:09.720> with<00:01:09.870> the<00:01:09.990> numbers<00:01:10.350> and<00:01:10.640> ended

00:01:11.630 --> 00:01:11.640 
started off with the numbers and ended

00:01:11.640 --> 00:01:17.450 
started off with the numbers and ended
up<00:01:11.730> with<00:01:11.940> anything<00:01:12.180> clock

00:01:17.450 --> 00:01:17.460 

00:01:17.460 --> 00:01:23.120 

it<00:01:18.420> works<00:01:18.720> as<00:01:19.020> a<00:01:20.240> 24-hour<00:01:21.240> clock<00:01:21.540> so<00:01:22.170> you<00:01:22.920> sort

00:01:23.120 --> 00:01:23.130 
it works as a 24-hour clock so you sort

00:01:23.130 --> 00:01:25.969 
it works as a 24-hour clock so you sort
of<00:01:23.220> have<00:01:23.400> to<00:01:23.430> learn<00:01:24.180> how<00:01:24.240> to<00:01:24.570> read<00:01:24.990> it<00:01:25.229> because

00:01:25.969 --> 00:01:25.979 
of have to learn how to read it because

00:01:25.979 --> 00:01:31.310 
of have to learn how to read it because
it<00:01:26.250> starts<00:01:26.700> at<00:01:27.440> zero<00:01:28.440> at<00:01:28.860> night<00:01:29.729> and<00:01:30.320> it's

00:01:31.310 --> 00:01:31.320 
it starts at zero at night and it's

00:01:31.320 --> 00:01:35.930 
it starts at zero at night and it's
knitting<00:01:31.850> one<00:01:32.850> round<00:01:33.150> every<00:01:34.020> day<00:01:34.170> so<00:01:35.070> one

00:01:35.930 --> 00:01:35.940 
knitting one round every day so one

00:01:35.940 --> 00:01:40.790 
knitting one round every day so one
match<00:01:36.540> is<00:01:37.310> 30<00:01:38.310> minutes<00:01:38.990> so<00:01:39.990> you<00:01:40.050> can<00:01:40.170> start

00:01:40.790 --> 00:01:40.800 
match is 30 minutes so you can start

00:01:40.800 --> 00:01:43.580 
match is 30 minutes so you can start
reading<00:01:41.399> the<00:01:41.550> clock<00:01:41.790> at<00:01:42.180> 12<00:01:42.509> and<00:01:42.990> then<00:01:43.560> you

00:01:43.580 --> 00:01:43.590 
reading the clock at 12 and then you

00:01:43.590 --> 00:01:46.550 
reading the clock at 12 and then you
know<00:01:43.830> it's<00:01:44.220> one<00:01:44.630> needle<00:01:45.630> for<00:01:45.840> every<00:01:46.080> half-hour

00:01:46.550 --> 00:01:46.560 
know it's one needle for every half-hour

00:01:46.560 --> 00:01:49.219 
know it's one needle for every half-hour
and<00:01:47.460> so<00:01:47.820> this<00:01:48.030> will<00:01:48.330> be<00:01:48.570> at<00:01:48.630> 6:00<00:01:48.960> in<00:01:49.200> the

00:01:49.219 --> 00:01:49.229 
and so this will be at 6:00 in the

00:01:49.229 --> 00:01:54.230 
and so this will be at 6:00 in the
morning<00:01:49.520> this<00:01:50.520> 12<00:01:51.770> midday<00:01:52.770> and<00:01:53.190> this<00:01:54.000> six

00:01:54.230 --> 00:01:54.240 
morning this 12 midday and this six

00:01:54.240 --> 00:01:56.029 
morning this 12 midday and this six
o'clock<00:01:54.570> in<00:01:54.720> the<00:01:54.750> evening<00:01:54.960> dance<00:01:55.380> and<00:01:55.679> when

00:01:56.029 --> 00:01:56.039 
o'clock in the evening dance and when

00:01:56.039 --> 00:01:58.400 
o'clock in the evening dance and when
you<00:01:56.160> have<00:01:56.399> those<00:01:56.640> four<00:01:57.000> coordinates<00:01:57.630> you<00:01:58.380> can

00:01:58.400 --> 00:01:58.410 
you have those four coordinates you can

00:01:58.410 --> 00:02:00.560 
you have those four coordinates you can
all<00:01:58.770> sort<00:01:58.950> of<00:01:59.070> get<00:01:59.220> used<00:01:59.490> to<00:01:59.670> reading<00:02:00.030> it<00:02:00.360> and

00:02:00.560 --> 00:02:00.570 
all sort of get used to reading it and

00:02:00.570 --> 00:02:06.190 
all sort of get used to reading it and
then<00:02:00.720> you<00:02:00.840> can<00:02:00.990> also<00:02:01.140> see<00:02:01.440> what<00:02:01.649> time<00:02:01.890> it<00:02:02.070> is

00:02:06.190 --> 00:02:06.200 

00:02:06.200 --> 00:02:09.190 

it<00:02:07.159> is<00:02:07.310> showing<00:02:07.549> the<00:02:07.820> time<00:02:08.060> and<00:02:08.300> presence<00:02:08.869> and

00:02:09.190 --> 00:02:09.200 
it is showing the time and presence and

00:02:09.200 --> 00:02:11.080 
it is showing the time and presence and
then<00:02:09.349> it's<00:02:09.560> also<00:02:09.800> showing<00:02:10.190> the<00:02:10.429> time<00:02:10.640> that<00:02:10.879> has

00:02:11.080 --> 00:02:11.090 
then it's also showing the time that has

00:02:11.090 --> 00:02:14.050 
then it's also showing the time that has
been<00:02:11.390> and<00:02:11.599> showing<00:02:12.500> the<00:02:12.650> time<00:02:12.890> that's<00:02:13.099> coming

00:02:14.050 --> 00:02:14.060 
been and showing the time that's coming
