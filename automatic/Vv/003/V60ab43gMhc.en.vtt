as well as a cauterizing machine called
a<00:00:37.770> high<00:00:37.920> freq<00:00:38.129> ater<00:00:38.340> the<00:00:38.640> first<00:00:39.600> thing<00:00:39.780> I'm

00:00:39.830 --> 00:00:39.840 
a high freq ater the first thing I'm

00:00:39.840 --> 00:00:42.410 
a high freq ater the first thing I'm
going<00:00:39.899> to<00:00:40.079> do<00:00:40.260> is<00:00:40.559> do<00:00:41.340> a<00:00:41.370> sketch<00:00:41.730> for<00:00:42.059> her<00:00:42.210> on

00:00:42.410 --> 00:00:42.420 
going to do is do a sketch for her on

00:00:42.420 --> 00:00:45.080 
going to do is do a sketch for her on
what<00:00:43.170> the<00:00:43.350> mole<00:00:43.559> is<00:00:43.800> and<00:00:44.160> how<00:00:44.520> the<00:00:44.579> procedure

00:00:45.080 --> 00:00:45.090 
what the mole is and how the procedure

00:00:45.090 --> 00:00:47.360 
what the mole is and how the procedure
goes<00:00:45.239> so<00:00:46.079> Nora<00:00:46.350> basically<00:00:46.890> the<00:00:47.010> mole<00:00:47.219> is<00:00:47.340> a

00:00:47.360 --> 00:00:47.370 
goes so Nora basically the mole is a

00:00:47.370 --> 00:00:49.549 
goes so Nora basically the mole is a
little<00:00:47.670> bump<00:00:47.879> on<00:00:48.059> the<00:00:48.239> skin<00:00:48.600> and<00:00:48.840> the<00:00:49.350> bump

00:00:49.549 --> 00:00:49.559 
little bump on the skin and the bump

00:00:49.559 --> 00:00:52.819 
little bump on the skin and the bump
contains<00:00:50.160> clusters<00:00:50.940> of<00:00:51.180> mole<00:00:51.390> cells<00:00:51.809> the<00:00:52.649> mole

00:00:52.819 --> 00:00:52.829 
contains clusters of mole cells the mole

00:00:52.829 --> 00:00:55.040 
contains clusters of mole cells the mole
cells<00:00:53.160> do<00:00:53.460> go<00:00:53.699> beneath<00:00:54.180> the<00:00:54.239> surface<00:00:54.420> of<00:00:54.930> the

00:00:55.040 --> 00:00:55.050 
cells do go beneath the surface of the

00:00:55.050 --> 00:00:58.549 
cells do go beneath the surface of the
skin<00:00:55.379> but<00:00:56.160> for<00:00:56.399> aesthetic<00:00:57.030> purposes<00:00:57.660> what<00:00:58.440> we

00:00:58.549 --> 00:00:58.559 
skin but for aesthetic purposes what we

00:00:58.559 --> 00:01:00.740 
skin but for aesthetic purposes what we
like<00:00:58.739> to<00:00:58.920> do<00:00:59.070> is<00:00:59.250> just<00:00:59.579> remove<00:00:59.910> the<00:01:00.120> bump<00:01:00.359> so

00:01:00.740 --> 00:01:00.750 
like to do is just remove the bump so

00:01:00.750 --> 00:01:02.569 
like to do is just remove the bump so
it's<00:01:00.930> flush<00:01:01.320> with<00:01:01.379> the<00:01:01.800> skin<00:01:02.160> and<00:01:02.370> you<00:01:02.430> don't

00:01:02.569 --> 00:01:02.579 
it's flush with the skin and you don't

00:01:02.579 --> 00:01:05.000 
it's flush with the skin and you don't
have<00:01:02.820> any<00:01:02.969> kind<00:01:03.239> of<00:01:03.329> indentation<00:01:04.320> in<00:01:04.589> the<00:01:04.650> mole

00:01:05.000 --> 00:01:05.010 
have any kind of indentation in the mole

00:01:05.010 --> 00:01:07.700 
have any kind of indentation in the mole
our<00:01:05.970> next<00:01:06.420> step<00:01:06.600> will<00:01:06.810> be<00:01:06.840> to<00:01:07.140> numb<00:01:07.409> up<00:01:07.439> the

00:01:07.700 --> 00:01:07.710 
our next step will be to numb up the

00:01:07.710 --> 00:01:09.440 
our next step will be to numb up the
moles<00:01:07.920> we're<00:01:08.729> going<00:01:08.880> to<00:01:08.970> use<00:01:09.090> some<00:01:09.270> local

00:01:09.440 --> 00:01:09.450 
moles we're going to use some local

00:01:09.450 --> 00:01:11.780 
moles we're going to use some local
anesthetic<00:01:10.200> for<00:01:10.409> this<00:01:10.710> one<00:01:10.920> first<00:01:11.400> I'm<00:01:11.580> going

00:01:11.780 --> 00:01:11.790 
anesthetic for this one first I'm going

00:01:11.790 --> 00:01:13.250 
anesthetic for this one first I'm going
to<00:01:11.909> clean<00:01:12.180> it<00:01:12.330> with<00:01:12.479> a<00:01:12.510> little<00:01:12.840> rubbing

00:01:13.250 --> 00:01:13.260 
to clean it with a little rubbing

00:01:13.260 --> 00:01:18.469 
to clean it with a little rubbing
alcohol<00:01:16.369> now<00:01:17.369> we're<00:01:17.640> gonna<00:01:17.759> actually<00:01:17.970> numb

00:01:18.469 --> 00:01:18.479 
alcohol now we're gonna actually numb

00:01:18.479 --> 00:01:21.350 
alcohol now we're gonna actually numb
the<00:01:18.659> moles<00:01:19.220> we<00:01:20.220> use<00:01:20.340> a<00:01:20.369> syringe<00:01:20.820> with<00:01:20.909> local

00:01:21.350 --> 00:01:21.360 
the moles we use a syringe with local

00:01:21.360 --> 00:01:23.929 
the moles we use a syringe with local
anesthetic<00:01:22.080> it's<00:01:22.770> actually<00:01:23.310> pretty<00:01:23.549> painless

00:01:23.929 --> 00:01:23.939 
anesthetic it's actually pretty painless

00:01:23.939 --> 00:01:27.649 
anesthetic it's actually pretty painless
to<00:01:24.390> do<00:01:24.540> this<00:01:24.689> procedure<00:01:26.090> so<00:01:27.090> it's<00:01:27.270> a<00:01:27.390> little

00:01:27.649 --> 00:01:27.659 
to do this procedure so it's a little

00:01:27.659 --> 00:01:33.319 
to do this procedure so it's a little
poke<00:01:30.740> the<00:01:31.740> local<00:01:32.100> anesthetic<00:01:32.369> actually<00:01:33.090> works

00:01:33.319 --> 00:01:33.329 
poke the local anesthetic actually works

00:01:33.329 --> 00:01:35.359 
poke the local anesthetic actually works
quite<00:01:33.479> quickly<00:01:34.140> and<00:01:34.530> we're<00:01:34.799> ready<00:01:34.979> to<00:01:35.189> do<00:01:35.340> our

00:01:35.359 --> 00:01:35.369 
quite quickly and we're ready to do our

00:01:35.369 --> 00:01:37.100 
quite quickly and we're ready to do our
next<00:01:35.729> step<00:01:35.880> of<00:01:36.030> the<00:01:36.119> procedure<00:01:36.299> which<00:01:36.840> is

00:01:37.100 --> 00:01:37.110 
next step of the procedure which is

00:01:37.110 --> 00:01:44.109 
next step of the procedure which is
removing<00:01:37.619> the<00:01:37.710> mole<00:01:41.000> what<00:01:42.000> we<00:01:42.150> like<00:01:42.390> to<00:01:42.689> do<00:01:42.950> is

00:01:44.109 --> 00:01:44.119 
removing the mole what we like to do is

00:01:44.119 --> 00:01:50.270 
removing the mole what we like to do is
basically<00:01:45.119> sculpt<00:01:45.899> the<00:01:46.140> mole<00:01:46.350> to<00:01:49.009> go<00:01:50.009> with<00:01:50.159> the

00:01:50.270 --> 00:01:50.280 
basically sculpt the mole to go with the

00:01:50.280 --> 00:01:52.730 
basically sculpt the mole to go with the
natural<00:01:50.909> contour<00:01:51.540> of<00:01:51.780> the<00:01:51.960> face<00:01:52.229> so<00:01:52.710> it

00:01:52.730 --> 00:01:52.740 
natural contour of the face so it

00:01:52.740 --> 00:01:54.710 
natural contour of the face so it
doesn't<00:01:53.159> look<00:01:53.369> like<00:01:53.549> there's<00:01:53.790> any<00:01:53.970> any<00:01:54.240> sort

00:01:54.710 --> 00:01:54.720 
doesn't look like there's any any sort

00:01:54.720 --> 00:01:59.120 
doesn't look like there's any any sort
of<00:01:55.020> indentation<00:01:56.479> and<00:01:57.740> ultimately<00:01:58.740> this<00:01:58.920> will

00:01:59.120 --> 00:01:59.130 
of indentation and ultimately this will

00:01:59.130 --> 00:02:12.260 
of indentation and ultimately this will
give<00:01:59.250> a<00:01:59.340> very<00:01:59.369> nice<00:01:59.729> cosmetic<00:02:00.479> result

00:02:12.260 --> 00:02:12.270 

00:02:12.270 --> 00:02:15.470 

the<00:02:13.230> next<00:02:13.530> thing<00:02:13.710> I'm<00:02:13.860> going<00:02:14.100> to<00:02:14.190> do<00:02:14.430> is<00:02:14.760> put<00:02:15.450> a

00:02:15.470 --> 00:02:15.480 
the next thing I'm going to do is put a

00:02:15.480 --> 00:02:17.540 
the next thing I'm going to do is put a
solution<00:02:16.020> that<00:02:16.170> can<00:02:16.350> stop<00:02:16.680> the<00:02:16.890> bleeding<00:02:17.280> for

00:02:17.540 --> 00:02:17.550 
solution that can stop the bleeding for

00:02:17.550 --> 00:02:26.480 
solution that can stop the bleeding for
us<00:02:23.450> okay<00:02:24.450> that<00:02:25.200> completes<00:02:25.410> the<00:02:25.830> first<00:02:26.100> step<00:02:26.370> of

00:02:26.480 --> 00:02:26.490 
us okay that completes the first step of

00:02:26.490 --> 00:02:28.610 
us okay that completes the first step of
removing<00:02:26.970> them<00:02:27.060> all<00:02:27.240> the<00:02:27.690> next<00:02:28.050> step<00:02:28.260> is<00:02:28.440> to

00:02:28.610 --> 00:02:28.620 
removing them all the next step is to

00:02:28.620 --> 00:02:30.830 
removing them all the next step is to
smooth<00:02:28.920> out<00:02:29.130> the<00:02:29.280> edges<00:02:29.460> so<00:02:29.910> the<00:02:30.030> contour<00:02:30.540> is

00:02:30.830 --> 00:02:30.840 
smooth out the edges so the contour is

00:02:30.840 --> 00:02:48.270 
smooth out the edges so the contour is
even

00:02:48.270 --> 00:02:48.280 

00:02:48.280 --> 00:02:51.510 

and<00:02:48.400> finally<00:02:49.210> what<00:02:49.360> I'm<00:02:49.450> going<00:02:49.660> to<00:02:49.780> do<00:02:49.960> is<00:02:50.520> use

00:02:51.510 --> 00:02:51.520 
and finally what I'm going to do is use

00:02:51.520 --> 00:02:54.720 
and finally what I'm going to do is use
something<00:02:51.820> called<00:02:52.000> cautery<00:02:52.900> or<00:02:53.200> a<00:02:53.260> -<00:02:53.770> cater<00:02:54.010> to

00:02:54.720 --> 00:02:54.730 
something called cautery or a - cater to

00:02:54.730 --> 00:02:57.630 
something called cautery or a - cater to
get<00:02:54.880> any<00:02:55.150> remainder<00:02:56.050> of<00:02:56.170> uneven<00:02:56.680> edge<00:02:56.980> nice

00:02:57.630 --> 00:02:57.640 
get any remainder of uneven edge nice

00:02:57.640 --> 00:03:12.160 
get any remainder of uneven edge nice
and<00:02:57.850> soft

00:03:12.160 --> 00:03:12.170 

00:03:12.170 --> 00:03:14.290 

now<00:03:12.740> you'll<00:03:12.920> notice<00:03:13.130> that<00:03:13.280> the<00:03:13.490> mole<00:03:13.730> looks<00:03:14.150> a

00:03:14.290 --> 00:03:14.300 
now you'll notice that the mole looks a

00:03:14.300 --> 00:03:16.720 
now you'll notice that the mole looks a
little<00:03:14.480> bit<00:03:14.780> darker<00:03:15.380> and<00:03:15.650> that's<00:03:16.340> from<00:03:16.610> the

00:03:16.720 --> 00:03:16.730 
little bit darker and that's from the

00:03:16.730 --> 00:03:18.760 
little bit darker and that's from the
solution<00:03:17.270> we<00:03:17.390> use<00:03:17.420> to<00:03:17.870> stop<00:03:18.110> the<00:03:18.290> bleeding<00:03:18.530> as

00:03:18.760 --> 00:03:18.770 
solution we use to stop the bleeding as

00:03:18.770 --> 00:03:21.130 
solution we use to stop the bleeding as
well<00:03:18.980> as<00:03:19.069> the<00:03:19.220> cautery<00:03:19.730> this<00:03:20.270> will<00:03:20.480> resolve<00:03:20.900> in

00:03:21.130 --> 00:03:21.140 
well as the cautery this will resolve in

00:03:21.140 --> 00:03:22.690 
well as the cautery this will resolve in
about<00:03:21.350> a<00:03:21.380> week<00:03:21.709> after<00:03:22.190> it<00:03:22.220> goes<00:03:22.400> through<00:03:22.610> its

00:03:22.690 --> 00:03:22.700 
about a week after it goes through its

00:03:22.700 --> 00:03:25.420 
about a week after it goes through its
healing<00:03:23.120> process<00:03:23.690> the<00:03:24.050> care<00:03:24.830> for<00:03:25.040> these<00:03:25.130> moles

00:03:25.420 --> 00:03:25.430 
healing process the care for these moles

00:03:25.430 --> 00:03:28.180 
healing process the care for these moles
is<00:03:25.610> rather<00:03:25.790> simple<00:03:26.270> you<00:03:26.750> can<00:03:26.959> shower<00:03:27.260> you<00:03:27.920> can

00:03:28.180 --> 00:03:28.190 
is rather simple you can shower you can

00:03:28.190 --> 00:03:32.020 
is rather simple you can shower you can
