they're a little harder to tool you got

00:00:25.680 --> 00:00:27.980 
they're a little harder to tool you got
to<00:00:25.830> be<00:00:25.920> a<00:00:25.949> little<00:00:26.160> quicker<00:00:26.460> with<00:00:26.760> it<00:00:26.970> so<00:00:27.300> we

00:00:27.980 --> 00:00:27.990 
to be a little quicker with it so we

00:00:27.990 --> 00:00:29.870 
to be a little quicker with it so we
want<00:00:28.199> to<00:00:28.260> make<00:00:28.650> sure<00:00:28.830> that<00:00:28.949> we<00:00:29.070> do<00:00:29.220> put<00:00:29.519> a<00:00:29.550> very

00:00:29.870 --> 00:00:29.880 
want to make sure that we do put a very

00:00:34.069 --> 00:00:34.079 
good bead for a uniform bead on so it'll

00:00:34.079 --> 00:00:39.040 
good bead for a uniform bead on so it'll
minimize<00:00:34.320> the<00:00:34.829> amount<00:00:35.070> of<00:00:35.219> tooling<00:00:35.760> required

I'm working about a three-foot section
at<00:00:55.800> the<00:00:55.920> most<00:00:56.190> that's<00:00:56.520> going<00:00:56.700> to<00:00:56.760> be<00:00:56.910> enough

00:00:57.340 --> 00:00:57.350 
at the most that's going to be enough

going to want to start to dry now for
our<00:01:02.280> tooling<00:01:02.550> we<00:01:02.879> simply<00:01:03.239> wet<00:01:03.420> our<00:01:03.570> finger

00:01:04.450 --> 00:01:04.460 
our tooling we simply wet our finger

00:01:04.460 --> 00:01:07.670 
our tooling we simply wet our finger
reply<00:01:05.460> even<00:01:05.760> pressure<00:01:06.210> on<00:01:06.450> both<00:01:06.630> sides<00:01:07.020> not<00:01:07.470> in
