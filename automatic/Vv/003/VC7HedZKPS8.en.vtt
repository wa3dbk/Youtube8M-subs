00:01:36.190 --> 00:01:36.200 
first night so we're looking at is

00:01:36.200 --> 00:01:43.600 
first night so we're looking at is
really<00:01:36.380> ain't<00:01:36.710> sore<00:01:36.950> do<00:01:37.070> this<00:01:42.430> yeah<00:01:43.430> I<00:01:43.460> think

00:01:43.600 --> 00:01:43.610 
really ain't sore do this yeah I think

00:01:43.610 --> 00:01:45.130 
really ain't sore do this yeah I think
an<00:01:43.760> energy<00:01:44.090> level<00:01:44.120> and<00:01:44.510> i<00:01:44.570> think<00:01:44.810> is<00:01:44.930> most

00:01:45.130 --> 00:01:45.140 
an energy level and i think is most

00:01:45.140 --> 00:01:46.990 
an energy level and i think is most
apparent<00:01:45.500> its<00:01:46.250> most<00:01:46.460> obvious<00:01:46.850> on<00:01:46.940> the

00:01:46.990 --> 00:01:47.000 
apparent its most obvious on the

00:01:47.000 --> 00:01:48.520 
apparent its most obvious on the
defensive<00:01:47.420> end<00:01:47.540> when<00:01:48.140> you<00:01:48.200> look<00:01:48.350> at<00:01:48.470> our

00:01:48.520 --> 00:01:48.530 
defensive end when you look at our

00:01:48.530 --> 00:01:49.870 
defensive end when you look at our
half-court<00:01:48.770> defense<00:01:49.370> either<00:01:49.520> get<00:01:49.790> our

00:01:49.870 --> 00:01:49.880 
half-court defense either get our

00:01:49.880 --> 00:01:51.940 
half-court defense either get our

deepest in general you know a lot of

00:01:51.950 --> 00:01:54.280 
deepest in general you know a lot of
times<00:01:52.250> it's<00:01:52.400> engage<00:01:52.670> our<00:01:52.880> effort<00:01:53.270> based<00:01:54.110> on
