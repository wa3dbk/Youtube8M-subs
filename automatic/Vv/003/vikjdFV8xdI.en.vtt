00:00:04.790 --> 00:00:12.059
 failure of 64% which is the violet sector 

00:00:09.540 --> 00:00:14.099
 try to negotiate directly with the 

00:00:12.059 --> 00:00:15.450
 exactly holdouts a private agreement 

00:00:14.099 --> 00:00:16.740
 but this does not know we're going to see 

00:00:15.450 --> 00:00:18.600
 the two types of surveys one that is 

00:00:16.740 --> 00:00:20.520
 public opinion and another that is 

00:00:18.600 --> 00:00:23.340
 opinion leaders their alignment in 

00:00:20.520 --> 00:00:25.710
 general anticipates the agenda anticipates what 

00:00:23.340 --> 00:00:27.689
 that will happen next and he already makes a 

00:00:25.710 --> 00:00:31.890
 month the opinion leaders held 

00:00:27.689 --> 00:00:34.559
 clearly that 64% does not believe that 

00:00:31.890 --> 00:00:36.300
 you had to negotiate with it with the 

00:00:34.559 --> 00:00:37.860
 holdouts but there are some there are other 

00:00:36.300 --> 00:00:41.370
 things that are interesting that we can 

00:00:37.860 --> 00:00:42.690
 see the other plates when they 

00:00:41.370 --> 00:00:45.420
 we ask if these facts that now 

00:00:42.690 --> 00:00:47.309
 let's see they would be increased will inhabit or 

00:00:45.420 --> 00:00:50.219
 will remain the same in the next six 

00:00:47.309 --> 00:00:52.410
 months partnership negotiation best medium 

00:00:50.219 --> 00:00:54.480
 if asked for example the falls of 

00:00:52.410 --> 00:00:56.850
 central bank reserves and this in 

00:00:54.480 --> 00:00:59.410
 the first one will increase they will continue 

00:00:56.850 --> 00:01:02.329
 they will decrease it anyway 

00:00:59.410 --> 00:01:05.150
 66% 6 of each day almost seven of each time 

00:01:02.329 --> 00:01:09.920
 He maintained that the 

00:01:05.150 --> 00:01:11.900
 reserves with 70 percent dollar 

00:01:09.920 --> 00:01:14.750
 I thought scribes or says clear look what 

00:01:11.900 --> 00:01:17.090
 that is happening to two areas of the 

00:01:14.750 --> 00:01:20.090
 inflation inflation goes up every ten 

00:01:17.090 --> 00:01:22.220
 believes that effectively it will raise the 

00:01:20.090 --> 00:01:25.100
 tax pressure 70 percent also 

00:01:22.220 --> 00:01:28.940
 he believed to increase if the conflict 

00:01:25.100 --> 00:01:31.369
 social also 65 percent believe this 

00:01:28.940 --> 00:01:34.880
 brand somehow somehow 

00:01:31.369 --> 00:01:36.560
 that we say in the vision that the 

00:01:34.880 --> 00:01:38.360
 Opinion leaders are pretty 

00:01:36.560 --> 00:01:40.520
 negative and the prospects are 

00:01:38.360 --> 00:01:42.289
 pretty pretty uncertain now 

00:01:40.520 --> 00:01:44.539
 going back to your original question not me 

00:01:42.289 --> 00:01:46.490
 under any point of view I think 

00:01:44.539 --> 00:01:48.869
 there is 60 percent of the population 

00:01:46.490 --> 00:01:53.530
 That this 

00:01:48.869 --> 00:01:54.610
 let's say in favor of non- payment of 

00:01:53.530 --> 00:01:56.799
 Debt 

00:01:54.610 --> 00:01:58.659
 not because they understand very well let's say 

00:01:56.799 --> 00:02:00.549
 what are the consequences but knows 

00:01:58.659 --> 00:02:03.720
 what were the consequences and 

00:02:00.549 --> 00:02:06.030
 then it tends not to be true 

00:02:03.720 --> 00:02:07.399
 evaluate respectively that it will return 

00:02:06.030 --> 00:02:10.320
 to happen the same 

00:02:07.399 --> 00:02:12.240
 Argentina is isolated from the world 

00:02:10.320 --> 00:02:14.820
 argentina let's say today has and this if the 

00:02:12.240 --> 00:02:16.770
 people see it argentina has problems of 

00:02:14.820 --> 00:02:18.390
 important reception people when 

00:02:16.770 --> 00:02:22.080
 we do a survey we see what they are 

00:02:18.390 --> 00:02:24.570
 the main concerns and they continue 

00:02:22.080 --> 00:02:26.430
 being of course the insecurity that 

00:02:24.570 --> 00:02:28.560
 it's not just insecurity anymore 

00:02:26.430 --> 00:02:30.510
 let's say in terms of serious crime of 

00:02:28.560 --> 00:02:31.380
 assault I want to ensure pay life or 

00:02:30.510 --> 00:02:34.560
 the violence 

00:02:31.380 --> 00:02:37.230
 let's say this is associated to the 

00:02:34.560 --> 00:02:38.700
 criminal behaviors that make you fear for 

00:02:37.230 --> 00:02:40.620
 the life of any boy who goes out to the 

00:02:38.700 --> 00:02:43.380
 night as less radio comes out as it returns 

00:02:40.620 --> 00:02:45.390
 But there is a growing problem 

00:02:43.380 --> 00:02:47.490
 through inflation and the deterioration of 

00:02:45.390 --> 00:02:50.490
 wages there is also a vision of 

00:02:47.490 --> 00:02:52.709
 an economy in retraction and a loss 

00:02:50.490 --> 00:02:54.690
 for the first time in many years there is a 

00:02:52.709 --> 00:02:56.250
 enormous fear of losing the job and of 

00:02:54.690 --> 00:02:59.310
 made the hard data of economy you 

00:02:56.250 --> 00:03:01.440
 show that there is a return 

00:02:59.310 --> 00:03:03.630
 behind one of the achievements 

00:03:01.440 --> 00:03:07.530
 I would say relatively important of 

00:03:03.630 --> 00:03:10.110
 this government that was laundering the 

00:03:07.530 --> 00:03:12.420
 I work in black and we are going back to 

00:03:10.110 --> 00:03:17.040
 previous stages ie return returns 

00:03:12.420 --> 00:03:19.610
 to informal work and the risk of 

00:03:17.040 --> 00:03:19.610
 unemployment 

00:03:21.370 --> 00:03:28.230
 it depends let's say if this is resolved by 

00:03:24.849 --> 00:03:31.599
 example if there is a default 

00:03:28.230 --> 00:03:36.849
 and together with the default 

00:03:31.599 --> 00:03:39.879
 this strategy of positioning the 

00:03:36.849 --> 00:03:42.489
 Argentine positions as a defense 

00:03:39.879 --> 00:03:43.000
 of low malvinizaciÃ³n that we said of the 

00:03:42.489 --> 00:03:45.370
 I think 

00:03:43.000 --> 00:03:47.530
 exactly the party or another appealing 

00:03:45.370 --> 00:03:50.379
 appealing let's say to the defense of the 

00:03:47.530 --> 00:03:52.150
 national sovereignty against capitalism 

00:03:50.379 --> 00:03:54.660
 financial predatory and so on 

00:03:52.150 --> 00:03:56.920
 etc. I think it can reinforce 

00:03:54.660 --> 00:03:59.799
 enormously what is this its own 

00:03:56.920 --> 00:04:01.540
 capital can somehow capture 

00:03:59.799 --> 00:04:03.519
 and ask about a sector of the 

00:04:01.540 --> 00:04:05.650
 population but that is very short term 

00:04:03.519 --> 00:04:07.510
 in fact I think the improvement that 

00:04:05.650 --> 00:04:10.299
 some surveys give the image 

00:04:07.510 --> 00:04:11.859
 cristina's personal not the image of the 

00:04:10.299 --> 00:04:13.720
 management in or discharge 

00:04:11.859 --> 00:04:15.430
 which is an interesting fact is 

00:04:13.720 --> 00:04:17.350
 linked to this are linked with 

00:04:15.430 --> 00:04:20.739
 we Argentines have a component 

00:04:17.350 --> 00:04:24.280
 authoritative in this important and 

00:04:20.739 --> 00:04:27.520
 So we look for strong leadership with 

00:04:24.280 --> 00:04:30.509
 success with features decision 

00:04:27.520 --> 00:04:30.509
 It is very marked
