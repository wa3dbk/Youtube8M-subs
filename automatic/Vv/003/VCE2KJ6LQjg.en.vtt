00:01:12.840 --> 00:01:12.850 
coming in that would be amazing the

00:01:12.850 --> 00:01:14.310 
coming in that would be amazing the
secondary<00:01:13.330> objectives<00:01:13.840> are<00:01:14.049> the

00:01:14.310 --> 00:01:14.320 
secondary objectives are the

00:01:14.320 --> 00:01:16.320 
secondary objectives are the
achievements<00:01:15.010> that<00:01:15.220> are<00:01:15.729> also<00:01:16.000> on<00:01:16.240> this

00:01:16.320 --> 00:01:16.330 
achievements that are also on this

00:01:16.330 --> 00:01:18.570 
achievements that are also on this
website<00:01:16.540> page<00:01:16.870> I've<00:01:17.049> just<00:01:17.170> cut<00:01:17.350> it<00:01:17.440> off<00:01:17.560> if<00:01:17.770> we

00:01:18.570 --> 00:01:18.580 
website page I've just cut it off if we

00:01:18.580 --> 00:01:20.340 
website page I've just cut it off if we
can't<00:01:18.880> contain<00:01:19.210> the<00:01:19.390> Horde<00:01:19.600> here<00:01:19.840> there's<00:01:20.110> no

00:01:20.340 --> 00:01:20.350 
can't contain the Horde here there's no

00:01:20.350 --> 00:01:22.890 
can't contain the Horde here there's no
telling<00:01:20.740> what<00:01:20.890> will<00:01:20.980> happen<00:01:21.010> next<00:01:21.720> say<00:01:22.720> the

00:01:22.890 --> 00:01:22.900 
telling what will happen next say the

00:01:22.900 --> 00:01:29.150 
telling what will happen next say the
characters<00:01:23.320> don't<00:01:23.620> contain<00:01:24.010> the<00:01:24.220> Horde<00:01:27.210> maybe

00:01:29.150 --> 00:01:29.160 
characters don't contain the Horde maybe

00:01:29.160 --> 00:01:31.680 
characters don't contain the Horde maybe
there'll<00:01:30.160> be<00:01:30.220> another<00:01:30.490> map<00:01:30.700> because<00:01:31.210> this<00:01:31.570> is

00:01:31.680 --> 00:01:31.690 
there'll be another map because this is

00:01:31.690 --> 00:01:32.970 
there'll be another map because this is
going<00:01:31.840> to<00:01:31.900> be<00:01:31.960> the<00:01:32.050> last<00:01:32.200> one<00:01:32.380> for<00:01:32.620> black<00:01:32.800> ops

00:01:32.970 --> 00:01:32.980 
going to be the last one for black ops

00:01:32.980 --> 00:01:35.190 
going to be the last one for black ops
because<00:01:33.460> modern<00:01:34.210> warfare<00:01:34.480> 3<00:01:34.630> is<00:01:34.840> just<00:01:35.020> around

00:01:35.190 --> 00:01:35.200 
because modern warfare 3 is just around

00:01:35.200 --> 00:01:37.470 
because modern warfare 3 is just around
the<00:01:35.290> corner<00:01:35.620> but<00:01:36.340> maybe<00:01:36.670> there's<00:01:37.180> going<00:01:37.360> to<00:01:37.420> be

00:01:37.470 --> 00:01:37.480 
the corner but maybe there's going to be

00:01:37.480 --> 00:01:39.120 
the corner but maybe there's going to be
another<00:01:37.720> game<00:01:38.020> down<00:01:38.290> the<00:01:38.320> line<00:01:38.590> with<00:01:38.800> zombies

00:01:39.120 --> 00:01:39.130 
another game down the line with zombies

00:01:39.130 --> 00:01:41.460 
another game down the line with zombies
in<00:01:39.280> which<00:01:39.550> will<00:01:39.910> be<00:01:40.030> awesome<00:01:40.080> but<00:01:41.080> if<00:01:41.260> they<00:01:41.410> do

00:01:41.460 --> 00:01:41.470 
in which will be awesome but if they do

00:01:41.470 --> 00:01:43.980 
in which will be awesome but if they do
contain<00:01:41.860> the<00:01:42.190> Horde<00:01:42.480> maybe<00:01:43.480> this<00:01:43.780> will<00:01:43.810> be<00:01:43.930> the

00:01:43.980 --> 00:01:43.990 
contain the Horde maybe this will be the

00:01:43.990 --> 00:01:46.770 
contain the Horde maybe this will be the
end<00:01:44.080> because<00:01:44.680> it's<00:01:44.860> such<00:01:45.040> an<00:01:45.220> epic<00:01:45.700> map<00:01:46.600> it

00:01:46.770 --> 00:01:46.780 
end because it's such an epic map it

00:01:46.780 --> 00:01:48.300 
end because it's such an epic map it
seems<00:01:47.020> there<00:01:47.260> are<00:01:47.290> three<00:01:47.530> types<00:01:47.710> of<00:01:47.920> zombies

00:01:48.300 --> 00:01:48.310 
seems there are three types of zombies

00:01:48.310 --> 00:01:51.030 
seems there are three types of zombies
at<00:01:48.490> least<00:01:48.780> and<00:01:49.780> it's<00:01:49.900> all<00:01:50.020> crazy<00:01:50.320> so<00:01:50.800> maybe

00:01:51.030 --> 00:01:51.040 
at least and it's all crazy so maybe

00:01:51.040 --> 00:01:55.620 
at least and it's all crazy so maybe
this<00:01:51.940> is<00:01:52.090> the<00:01:52.210> end<00:01:52.360> I<00:01:52.690> have<00:01:53.620> no<00:01:53.800> idea<00:01:54.630> ethereal

00:01:55.620 --> 00:01:55.630 
this is the end I have no idea ethereal

00:01:55.630 --> 00:01:58.050 
this is the end I have no idea ethereal
have<00:01:55.870> kind<00:01:56.500> of<00:01:56.680> thought<00:01:56.950> of<00:01:57.160> is<00:01:57.370> that<00:01:57.610> this<00:01:57.760> map

00:01:58.050 --> 00:01:58.060 
have kind of thought of is that this map

00:01:58.060 --> 00:02:01.620 
have kind of thought of is that this map
is<00:01:58.090> three<00:01:59.020> different<00:01:59.500> maps<00:02:00.270> stick<00:02:01.270> with<00:02:01.420> me<00:02:01.480> on

00:02:01.620 --> 00:02:01.630 
is three different maps stick with me on

00:02:01.630 --> 00:02:04.790 
is three different maps stick with me on
this<00:02:01.750> the<00:02:02.560> original<00:02:03.010> characters<00:02:03.520> fight<00:02:04.000> off

00:02:04.790 --> 00:02:04.800 
this the original characters fight off

00:02:04.800 --> 00:02:08.100 
this the original characters fight off
one<00:02:05.800> type<00:02:06.130> of<00:02:06.160> zombie<00:02:06.670> the<00:02:07.480> four<00:02:07.720> characters

00:02:08.100 --> 00:02:08.110 
one type of zombie the four characters

00:02:08.110 --> 00:02:10.499 
one type of zombie the four characters
from<00:02:08.229> 5<00:02:08.530> come<00:02:09.099> in<00:02:09.129> and<00:02:09.489> fight<00:02:09.940> off<00:02:10.090> a<00:02:10.300> different

00:02:10.499 --> 00:02:10.509 
from 5 come in and fight off a different

00:02:10.509 --> 00:02:12.899 
from 5 come in and fight off a different
type<00:02:10.810> of<00:02:10.840> zombie<00:02:11.290> and<00:02:11.470> the<00:02:12.129> last<00:02:12.340> four<00:02:12.610> come<00:02:12.790> in

00:02:12.899 --> 00:02:12.909 
type of zombie and the last four come in
