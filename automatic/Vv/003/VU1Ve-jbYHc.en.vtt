00:00:00.500 --> 00:00:07.140
 as you can understand is a 

00:00:03.900 --> 00:00:10.559
 a thoughtful list 

00:00:07.140 --> 00:00:12.120
 surely not that we are more certain what 

00:00:10.559 --> 00:00:14.250
 true that you but if we want 

00:00:12.120 --> 00:00:15.690
 result many laps and we have worked 

00:00:14.250 --> 00:00:18.210
 consequently believing that it was what 

00:00:15.690 --> 00:00:22.109
 better for us for everyone from the 

00:00:18.210 --> 00:00:23.490
 respect and never from subtracting merits to 

00:00:22.109 --> 00:00:25.609
 those who have been with us these 

00:00:23.490 --> 00:00:27.810
 days that have had a behavior 

00:00:25.609 --> 00:00:31.380
 magnificent that they will continue with 

00:00:27.810 --> 00:00:34.100
 us until Wednesday night 

00:00:31.380 --> 00:00:37.290
 after the game against South Korea 

00:00:34.100 --> 00:00:39.030
 and that this list is final but 

00:00:37.290 --> 00:00:41.130
 also on the other hand at the moment because 

00:00:39.030 --> 00:00:42.930
 there may be some setback as 

00:00:41.130 --> 00:00:44.490
 you know there is a player who has not yet 

00:00:42.930 --> 00:00:46.170
 is in the best conditions or because 

00:00:44.490 --> 00:00:50.730
 comes with a drag a small 

00:00:46.170 --> 00:00:53.280
 annoyance and that if there were any 

00:00:50.730 --> 00:00:55.710
 incidence we will have time to 

00:00:53.280 --> 00:00:58.140
 react seems to me 48 hours before 

00:00:55.710 --> 00:01:00.900
 of the start of the championship so this 

00:00:58.140 --> 00:01:04.110
 is the call out 

00:01:00.900 --> 00:01:07.470
 no case in particular and all all 

00:01:04.110 --> 00:01:08.880
 all because yesterday they have shown then 

00:01:07.470 --> 00:01:12.870
 from javi garcía which is the least 

00:01:08.880 --> 00:01:14.430
 minutes played montreal beñat all the 

00:01:12.870 --> 00:01:17.160
 they played that are not here with 

00:01:14.430 --> 00:01:19.240
 we who do not come who are not in 

00:01:17.160 --> 00:01:21.100
 that list of 23 

00:01:19.240 --> 00:01:22.270
 they have done some great workouts 

00:01:21.100 --> 00:01:24.579
 and they have ratified what we 

00:01:22.270 --> 00:01:28.230
 we had planned before bringing them and 

00:01:24.579 --> 00:01:33.420
 therefore the pain is for 

00:01:28.230 --> 00:01:35.280
 towards all all of you can not because not 

00:01:33.420 --> 00:01:37.560
 to be able to bring more people and power and power 

00:01:35.280 --> 00:01:39.480
 bring to them I think there is no 

00:01:37.560 --> 00:01:42.290
 special case that all I imagine that 

00:01:39.480 --> 00:01:45.170
 inside they have the same 

00:01:42.290 --> 00:01:47.050
 the same bustillo that I have soldier 

00:01:45.170 --> 00:01:49.270
 Adrián 

00:01:47.050 --> 00:01:51.430
 beñat and all those who have been with 

00:01:49.270 --> 00:01:53.770
 we who can feel a little 

00:01:51.430 --> 00:01:55.060
 hurt but I have already told you that they have 

00:01:53.770 --> 00:01:57.340
 to be good athletes and that 

00:01:55.060 --> 00:02:00.090
 we have brought them and we 

00:01:57.340 --> 00:02:02.380
 we leave but do not want to be a 

00:02:00.090 --> 00:02:04.840
 momentary withdrawal because in 

00:02:02.380 --> 00:02:06.700
 September we start order August 

00:02:04.840 --> 00:02:09.050
 we started again calls and that 

00:02:06.700 --> 00:02:11.270
 They must d 

00:02:09.050 --> 00:02:13.670
 well be aware that they 

00:02:11.270 --> 00:02:15.080
 they are very close to the good selection 

00:02:13.670 --> 00:02:16.580
 here everyone is on their own merits 

00:02:15.080 --> 00:02:18.710
 naturally but I said that there 

00:02:16.580 --> 00:02:21.110
 many many more that have made merit 

00:02:18.710 --> 00:02:24.440
 and possibly benefited 

00:02:21.110 --> 00:02:26.900
 also from that situation of andoni 

00:02:24.440 --> 00:02:28.070
 iraola but it is also by merit and 

00:02:26.900 --> 00:02:29.510
 I think it was a boy who has 

00:02:28.070 --> 00:02:32.120
 done very good season in the middle of 

00:02:29.510 --> 00:02:35.569
 end season beyond 

00:02:32.120 --> 00:02:37.849
 other issues that from different 

00:02:35.569 --> 00:02:39.950
 Spain sites may think so 

00:02:37.849 --> 00:02:42.709
 because not so-and-so because it does not come and 

00:02:39.950 --> 00:02:43.909
 always well we already know that each one 

00:02:42.709 --> 00:02:45.440
 well up a little things 

00:02:43.909 --> 00:02:47.480
 also many let's see villa is 

00:02:45.440 --> 00:02:50.060
 irreplaceable I want to say that as 

00:02:47.480 --> 00:02:52.340
 player by its characteristics and by its 

00:02:50.060 --> 00:02:53.540
 effectiveness in recent years I 

00:02:52.340 --> 00:02:56.510
 I think there is no one who has done it 

00:02:53.540 --> 00:02:59.480
 better than him but of course we have to 

00:02:56.510 --> 00:03:03.860
 look for solutions and solutions from 

00:02:59.480 --> 00:03:05.989
 kill silva pedro iniesta yo I know 

00:03:03.860 --> 00:03:08.660
 even a forward thrown in the band 

00:03:05.989 --> 00:03:11.090
 left we have solutions for all 

00:03:08.660 --> 00:03:12.830
 sides the only thing that is true and I have it 

00:03:11.090 --> 00:03:15.410
 what to say 

00:03:12.830 --> 00:03:17.630
 for affection towards asia life and so 

00:03:15.410 --> 00:03:19.700
 has given us all these years that we are 

00:03:17.630 --> 00:03:20.810
 us and before I think so 

00:03:19.700 --> 00:03:23.210
 irreplaceable 

00:03:20.810 --> 00:03:27.500
 let's see we have four 

00:03:23.210 --> 00:03:29.900
 years in four years is now his way in 

00:03:27.500 --> 00:03:34.220
 field players there has been a 50 

00:03:29.900 --> 00:03:36.770
 percent of changes within a 

00:03:34.220 --> 00:03:39.080
 relatively young selection but of the 

00:03:36.770 --> 00:03:41.030
 eurocopa of 2008 to which we are at the 

00:03:39.080 --> 00:03:43.460
 that we are going to start competing have been 

00:03:41.030 --> 00:03:46.790
 produced 50 percent of changes of 

00:03:43.460 --> 00:03:48.830
 field players 7 the year before 

00:03:46.790 --> 00:03:51.470
 South Africa plus 3 now if I'm not wrong 

00:03:48.830 --> 00:03:53.720
 juanfran negredo jordi and so are 10 

00:03:51.470 --> 00:03:56.000
 that of 20 players that we have of 

00:03:53.720 --> 00:03:58.720
 fields are 50 percent means 

00:03:56.000 --> 00:04:00.950
 what is a renovation 

00:03:58.720 --> 00:04:03.170
 did not give necessary but that we have 

00:04:00.950 --> 00:04:06.380
 wanted convenient and it's soccer the 

00:04:03.170 --> 00:04:08.750
 groups must have the 6 filling in 

00:04:06.380 --> 00:04:10.640
 people and new blood is true but 

00:04:08.750 --> 00:04:12.710
 do not change to change because it is also 

00:04:10.640 --> 00:04:14.420
 true that we have players in full 

00:04:12.710 --> 00:04:16.640
 practically and that they are is a 

00:04:14.420 --> 00:04:18.920
 generation and I hope it still lasts for us 

00:04:16.640 --> 00:04:21.079
 I do not believe beyond the results that 

00:04:18.920 --> 00:04:25.230
 can obtain but a priori we do not have 

00:04:21.079 --> 00:04:27.750
 why doubt them are players who 

00:04:25.230 --> 00:04:30.990
 chord they surpass the barrier of 

00:04:27.750 --> 00:04:34.100
 the 30s and the rest are kids that 

00:04:30.990 --> 00:04:34.100
 they are in full
