00:02:31.520 --> 00:02:31.530 
organic foundation and that was where my

00:02:31.530 --> 00:02:34.790 
organic foundation and that was where my
issues<00:02:31.920> were<00:02:32.220> so<00:02:32.910> then<00:02:33.360> I<00:02:33.390> tried<00:02:33.840> it<00:02:33.870> with<00:02:34.260> my

00:02:34.790 --> 00:02:34.800 
issues were so then I tried it with my

00:02:34.800 --> 00:02:38.540 
issues were so then I tried it with my
Dior<00:02:35.099> nude<00:02:36.170> foundation<00:02:37.170> and<00:02:37.620> it<00:02:38.130> worked<00:02:38.310> great

00:02:38.540 --> 00:02:38.550 
Dior nude foundation and it worked great

00:02:38.550 --> 00:02:40.280 
Dior nude foundation and it worked great
with<00:02:38.580> that<00:02:38.849> I<00:02:38.880> had<00:02:39.120> no<00:02:39.300> problems<00:02:39.780> so<00:02:40.050> I'm

00:02:40.280 --> 00:02:40.290 
with that I had no problems so I'm

00:02:40.290 --> 00:02:42.890 
with that I had no problems so I'm
wondering<00:02:40.650> if<00:02:41.090> the<00:02:42.090> reason<00:02:42.480> I<00:02:42.540> had<00:02:42.690> a<00:02:42.720> problem

00:02:42.890 --> 00:02:42.900 
wondering if the reason I had a problem

00:02:42.900 --> 00:02:45.949 
wondering if the reason I had a problem
with<00:02:43.170> this<00:02:43.380> along<00:02:43.769> with<00:02:43.799> my<00:02:44.540> Studio<00:02:45.540> sculpt

00:02:45.949 --> 00:02:45.959 
with this along with my Studio sculpt

00:02:45.959 --> 00:02:48.680 
with this along with my Studio sculpt
foundation<00:02:46.890> is<00:02:47.129> because<00:02:47.610> the<00:02:48.030> Studio<00:02:48.360> sculpt

00:02:48.680 --> 00:02:48.690 
foundation is because the Studio sculpt

00:02:48.690 --> 00:02:50.870 
foundation is because the Studio sculpt
contains<00:02:49.049> shea<00:02:49.290> butter<00:02:49.560> an<00:02:49.739> F<00:02:49.860> so<00:02:50.790> I'm

00:02:50.870 --> 00:02:50.880 
contains shea butter an F so I'm

00:02:50.880 --> 00:02:57.949 
contains shea butter an F so I'm
wondering<00:02:51.390> if<00:02:51.630> the<00:02:52.440> fact<00:02:53.660> that<00:02:54.660> that<00:02:55.170> has<00:02:56.959> the

00:02:57.949 --> 00:02:57.959 
wondering if the fact that that has the

00:02:57.959 --> 00:03:00.410 
wondering if the fact that that has the
shea<00:02:58.260> butter<00:02:58.290> and<00:02:58.829> then<00:02:59.370> the<00:02:59.549> fact<00:02:59.790> that<00:02:59.970> this

00:03:00.410 --> 00:03:00.420 
shea butter and then the fact that this

00:03:00.420 --> 00:03:05.030 
shea butter and then the fact that this
is<00:03:01.280> vitamin<00:03:02.280> E<00:03:02.670> to<00:03:03.329> it<00:03:03.510> if<00:03:03.780> those<00:03:04.290> two<00:03:04.620> didn't

00:03:05.030 --> 00:03:05.040 
is vitamin E to it if those two didn't

00:03:05.040 --> 00:03:07.009 
is vitamin E to it if those two didn't
react<00:03:05.370> properly<00:03:05.640> together<00:03:06.060> so<00:03:06.450> I'm<00:03:06.569> having<00:03:06.810> a
