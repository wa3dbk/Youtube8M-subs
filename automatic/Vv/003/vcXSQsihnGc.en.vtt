this weekend he said this video will be
to<00:00:38.309> demonstrate<00:00:38.760> turning<00:00:39.120> obviously<00:00:39.450> there's

00:00:39.619 --> 00:00:39.629 
to demonstrate turning obviously there's

00:00:39.629 --> 00:00:41.569 
to demonstrate turning obviously there's
no<00:00:39.690> stickers<00:00:40.050> on<00:00:40.170> it<00:00:40.200> yet<00:00:40.410> but<00:00:40.710> we<00:00:41.250> have<00:00:41.280> those

00:00:41.569 --> 00:00:41.579 
no stickers on it yet but we have those

00:00:41.579 --> 00:00:43.700 
no stickers on it yet but we have those
coming<00:00:41.879> also<00:00:42.000> soon<00:00:42.360> thanks<00:00:43.020> to<00:00:43.140> Oliver<00:00:43.290> from

00:00:43.700 --> 00:00:43.710 
coming also soon thanks to Oliver from

00:00:43.710 --> 00:00:48.410 
coming also soon thanks to Oliver from
the<00:00:43.800> form<00:00:45.170> so<00:00:46.170> there<00:00:47.160> you<00:00:47.190> go<00:00:47.250> the<00:00:47.850> turning<00:00:48.210> I

00:00:48.410 --> 00:00:48.420 
the form so there you go the turning I

00:00:48.420 --> 00:00:51.619 
the form so there you go the turning I
think<00:00:49.050> could<00:00:49.649> be<00:00:49.860> better<00:00:50.039> the<00:00:50.550> inner<00:00:51.390> layers

00:00:51.619 --> 00:00:51.629 
think could be better the inner layers

00:00:51.629 --> 00:00:57.400 
think could be better the inner layers
horse<00:00:51.930> all<00:00:52.140> our<00:00:52.949> neck<00:00:55.070> nice<00:00:56.070> and<00:00:56.100> smooth

00:00:57.400 --> 00:00:57.410 
horse all our neck nice and smooth

00:00:57.410 --> 00:01:06.230 
horse all our neck nice and smooth
direction

00:01:06.230 --> 00:01:06.240 

00:01:06.240 --> 00:01:08.850 

one<00:01:07.240> of<00:01:07.330> the<00:01:07.420> major<00:01:07.750> difficulties<00:01:08.590> of<00:01:08.740> this

00:01:08.850 --> 00:01:08.860 
one of the major difficulties of this

00:01:08.860 --> 00:01:13.890 
one of the major difficulties of this
puzzle<00:01:09.070> is<00:01:09.900> that<00:01:12.240> one<00:01:13.240> the<00:01:13.390> pieces<00:01:13.630> are<00:01:13.750> very

00:01:13.890 --> 00:01:13.900 
puzzle is that one the pieces are very

00:01:13.900 --> 00:01:17.910 
puzzle is that one the pieces are very
hollow<00:01:14.170> so<00:01:14.770> as<00:01:15.670> you<00:01:15.820> can<00:01:15.940> see<00:01:16.180> i<00:01:16.390> see<00:01:16.740> you<00:01:17.740> could

00:01:17.910 --> 00:01:17.920 
hollow so as you can see i see you could

00:01:17.920 --> 00:01:21.870 
hollow so as you can see i see you could
view<00:01:18.100> here<00:01:18.990> that<00:01:19.990> piece<00:01:20.229> is<00:01:20.729> totally<00:01:21.729> Hollow

00:01:21.870 --> 00:01:21.880 
view here that piece is totally Hollow

00:01:21.880 --> 00:01:24.540 
view here that piece is totally Hollow
here<00:01:22.180> the<00:01:22.330> one<00:01:22.420> sticking<00:01:22.630> out<00:01:23.340> hold<00:01:24.340> it<00:01:24.430> by

00:01:24.540 --> 00:01:24.550 
here the one sticking out hold it by

00:01:24.550 --> 00:01:26.190 
here the one sticking out hold it by
that<00:01:24.700> piece<00:01:24.910> most<00:01:25.660> of<00:01:25.780> the<00:01:25.840> pieces<00:01:25.930> were

00:01:26.190 --> 00:01:26.200 
that piece most of the pieces were

00:01:26.200 --> 00:01:27.960 
that piece most of the pieces were
hollowed<00:01:26.590> basically<00:01:27.250> to<00:01:27.370> the<00:01:27.490> extreme<00:01:27.850> that

00:01:27.960 --> 00:01:27.970 
hollowed basically to the extreme that

00:01:27.970 --> 00:01:30.210 
hollowed basically to the extreme that
Shapeways<00:01:28.330> can<00:01:28.510> print<00:01:28.750> so<00:01:29.380> that<00:01:29.560> the<00:01:29.920> puzzle

00:01:30.210 --> 00:01:30.220 
Shapeways can print so that the puzzle

00:01:30.220 --> 00:01:31.740 
Shapeways can print so that the puzzle
would<00:01:30.310> keep<00:01:30.490> as<00:01:30.790> cheap<00:01:31.060> as<00:01:31.150> possible<00:01:31.240> at<00:01:31.630> all

00:01:31.740 --> 00:01:31.750 
would keep as cheap as possible at all

00:01:31.750 --> 00:01:33.960 
would keep as cheap as possible at all
but<00:01:32.020> also<00:01:32.320> the<00:01:32.680> reason<00:01:32.830> why<00:01:32.979> we<00:01:33.370> made<00:01:33.550> it<00:01:33.700> so

00:01:33.960 --> 00:01:33.970 
but also the reason why we made it so

00:01:33.970 --> 00:01:38.430 
but also the reason why we made it so
small<00:01:34.860> this<00:01:35.860> is<00:01:36.009> compared<00:01:36.340> to<00:01:36.369> v<00:01:36.550> q7<00:01:37.440> here's

00:01:38.430 --> 00:01:38.440 
small this is compared to v q7 here's

00:01:38.440 --> 00:01:42.990 
small this is compared to v q7 here's
compared<00:01:38.800> to<00:01:39.040> a<00:01:39.070> 3<00:01:39.610> by<00:01:39.729> 3<00:01:40.470> so<00:01:41.580> just<00:01:42.580> a<00:01:42.759> little

00:01:42.990 --> 00:01:43.000 
compared to a 3 by 3 so just a little

00:01:43.000 --> 00:01:43.890 
compared to a 3 by 3 so just a little
bit<00:01:43.119> bigger<00:01:43.270> than<00:01:43.420> the<00:01:43.479> three<00:01:43.600> lately

00:01:43.890 --> 00:01:43.900 
bit bigger than the three lately

00:01:43.900 --> 00:01:46.650 
bit bigger than the three lately
actually<00:01:44.040> 62<00:01:45.040> millimeters<00:01:45.520> into<00:01:46.060> an<00:01:46.150> inch<00:01:46.300> in

00:01:46.650 --> 00:01:46.660 
actually 62 millimeters into an inch in

00:01:46.660 --> 00:01:51.900 
actually 62 millimeters into an inch in
corner<00:01:46.960> corner<00:01:50.009> so<00:01:51.009> the<00:01:51.130> puzzle<00:01:51.400> the<00:01:51.610> pieces

00:01:51.900 --> 00:01:51.910 
corner corner so the puzzle the pieces

00:01:51.910 --> 00:01:54.540 
corner corner so the puzzle the pieces
are<00:01:52.150> very<00:01:52.300> hollow<00:01:52.509> and<00:01:52.780> sometimes<00:01:53.650> one<00:01:54.430> of

00:01:54.540 --> 00:01:54.550 
are very hollow and sometimes one of

00:01:54.550 --> 00:01:56.940 
are very hollow and sometimes one of
them<00:01:54.640> may<00:01:54.850> angle<00:01:55.360> itself<00:01:55.600> into<00:01:56.229> the<00:01:56.350> hollow<00:01:56.560> of

00:01:56.940 --> 00:01:56.950 
them may angle itself into the hollow of

00:01:56.950 --> 00:01:59.580 
them may angle itself into the hollow of
an<00:01:57.280> adjacent<00:01:57.700> piece<00:01:57.850> and<00:01:58.119> then<00:01:58.210> get<00:01:58.420> stuck<00:01:58.660> so

00:01:59.580 --> 00:01:59.590 
an adjacent piece and then get stuck so

00:01:59.590 --> 00:02:01.530 
an adjacent piece and then get stuck so
that's<00:01:59.740> one<00:02:00.040> problem<00:02:00.399> that<00:02:00.610> I<00:02:00.820> think<00:02:01.180> should

00:02:01.530 --> 00:02:01.540 
that's one problem that I think should

00:02:01.540 --> 00:02:05.130 
that's one problem that I think should
be<00:02:01.720> maybe<00:02:02.590> fix<00:02:02.890> a<00:02:03.009> little<00:02:03.130> bit<00:02:03.399> another<00:02:04.300> is<00:02:04.600> the

00:02:05.130 --> 00:02:05.140 
be maybe fix a little bit another is the

00:02:05.140 --> 00:02:08.160 
be maybe fix a little bit another is the
fact<00:02:05.470> that<00:02:05.619> it's<00:02:06.040> cut<00:02:07.000> its<00:02:07.240> stable<00:02:07.899> in<00:02:08.050> the

00:02:08.160 --> 00:02:08.170 
fact that it's cut its stable in the

00:02:08.170 --> 00:02:10.200 
fact that it's cut its stable in the
middle<00:02:08.530> building<00:02:09.039> outside<00:02:09.250> the<00:02:09.580> very<00:02:09.759> loose<00:02:10.000> I

00:02:10.200 --> 00:02:10.210 
middle building outside the very loose I

00:02:10.210 --> 00:02:12.540 
middle building outside the very loose I
can<00:02:10.360> pull<00:02:11.110> it<00:02:11.230> apart<00:02:11.319> and<00:02:11.740> so<00:02:12.220> for<00:02:12.400> that<00:02:12.430> reason

00:02:12.540 --> 00:02:12.550 
can pull it apart and so for that reason

00:02:12.550 --> 00:02:14.790 
can pull it apart and so for that reason
the<00:02:12.850> outer<00:02:13.090> layers<00:02:13.450> while<00:02:14.170> they<00:02:14.380> are<00:02:14.560> very

00:02:14.790 --> 00:02:14.800 
the outer layers while they are very

00:02:14.800 --> 00:02:16.800 
the outer layers while they are very
smooth<00:02:15.160> when<00:02:15.370> everything<00:02:15.670> is<00:02:15.790> aligned<00:02:16.060> can

00:02:16.800 --> 00:02:16.810 
smooth when everything is aligned can

00:02:16.810 --> 00:02:20.520 
smooth when everything is aligned can
easily<00:02:17.260> get<00:02:17.410> misaligned<00:02:17.950> and<00:02:18.630> therefore<00:02:19.630> get

00:02:20.520 --> 00:02:20.530 
easily get misaligned and therefore get

00:02:20.530 --> 00:02:23.699 
easily get misaligned and therefore get
caught<00:02:20.800> on<00:02:20.830> each<00:02:21.100> other<00:02:21.280> as<00:02:21.850> you<00:02:22.000> see<00:02:22.709> like

00:02:23.699 --> 00:02:23.709 
caught on each other as you see like

00:02:23.709 --> 00:02:25.320 
caught on each other as you see like
corners<00:02:24.340> are<00:02:24.459> catching<00:02:24.819> like<00:02:25.000> that<00:02:25.150> because

00:02:25.320 --> 00:02:25.330 
corners are catching like that because

00:02:25.330 --> 00:02:29.280 
corners are catching like that because
it<00:02:25.420> turns<00:02:26.910> but

00:02:29.280 --> 00:02:29.290 
it turns but

00:02:29.290 --> 00:02:32.130 
it turns but
once<00:02:29.920> that<00:02:30.310> problem<00:02:30.790> is<00:02:30.939> alleviated<00:02:31.689> I<00:02:31.840> think

00:02:32.130 --> 00:02:32.140 
once that problem is alleviated I think

00:02:32.140 --> 00:02:33.929 
once that problem is alleviated I think
this<00:02:32.260> has<00:02:32.680> the<00:02:32.799> potential<00:02:33.069> to<00:02:33.219> be<00:02:33.370> a<00:02:33.400> very<00:02:33.459> good

00:02:33.929 --> 00:02:33.939 
this has the potential to be a very good

00:02:33.939 --> 00:02:37.740 
this has the potential to be a very good
mechanism<00:02:34.450> for<00:02:35.019> high<00:02:35.650> or<00:02:35.829> even<00:02:36.189> of<00:02:36.280> reviews<00:02:36.750> so

00:02:37.740 --> 00:02:37.750 
mechanism for high or even of reviews so

00:02:37.750 --> 00:02:41.339 
mechanism for high or even of reviews so
like<00:02:38.019> I<00:02:38.079> said<00:02:38.189> middle<00:02:39.189> layers<00:02:39.370> are<00:02:39.579> great<00:02:40.349> the

00:02:41.339 --> 00:02:41.349 
like I said middle layers are great the

00:02:41.349 --> 00:02:44.160 
like I said middle layers are great the
third<00:02:41.560> layers<00:02:41.799> are<00:02:42.129> similar<00:02:42.700> because<00:02:43.569> they're

00:02:44.160 --> 00:02:44.170 
third layers are similar because they're

00:02:44.170 --> 00:02:46.710 
third layers are similar because they're
close<00:02:44.500> enough<00:02:44.530> to<00:02:45.099> the<00:02:45.310> center<00:02:46.239> of<00:02:46.269> the<00:02:46.450> public

00:02:46.710 --> 00:02:46.720 
close enough to the center of the public

00:02:46.720 --> 00:02:47.910 
close enough to the center of the public
most<00:02:46.870> stable<00:02:46.989> as<00:02:47.170> part<00:02:47.409> of<00:02:47.439> the<00:02:47.530> puzzle<00:02:47.680> but

00:02:47.910 --> 00:02:47.920 
most stable as part of the puzzle but

00:02:47.920 --> 00:02:49.319 
most stable as part of the puzzle but
they<00:02:48.129> don't<00:02:48.430> crack<00:02:48.700> as<00:02:48.849> much<00:02:49.030> of<00:02:49.150> the<00:02:49.209> outer

00:02:49.319 --> 00:02:49.329 
they don't crack as much of the outer

00:02:49.329 --> 00:02:54.809 
they don't crack as much of the outer
layers<00:02:49.620> so<00:02:50.620> there's<00:02:51.069> a<00:02:51.159> third<00:02:51.370> layers<00:02:53.819> the

00:02:54.809 --> 00:02:54.819 
layers so there's a third layers the

00:02:54.819 --> 00:02:57.360 
layers so there's a third layers the
other<00:02:54.939> side<00:02:55.209> of<00:02:55.239> the<00:02:55.420> third<00:02:55.659> I<00:02:56.069> meant<00:02:57.069> to<00:02:57.250> be<00:02:57.340> a

00:02:57.360 --> 00:02:57.370 
other side of the third I meant to be a

00:02:57.370 --> 00:02:59.940 
other side of the third I meant to be a
little<00:02:57.909> bit<00:02:58.120> of<00:02:58.209> a<00:02:58.329> hassle<00:02:58.840> so<00:02:59.409> once<00:02:59.620> it<00:02:59.709> gets<00:02:59.859> a

00:02:59.940 --> 00:02:59.950 
little bit of a hassle so once it gets a

00:02:59.950 --> 00:03:04.140 
little bit of a hassle so once it gets a
line<00:03:00.129> it's<00:03:00.760> not<00:03:00.909> bad<00:03:02.489> second<00:03:03.489> layers<00:03:03.670> in<00:03:04.030> my

00:03:04.140 --> 00:03:04.150 
line it's not bad second layers in my

00:03:04.150 --> 00:03:07.800 
line it's not bad second layers in my
opinion<00:03:04.480> are<00:03:04.930> the<00:03:05.340> worst<00:03:06.340> ones<00:03:06.639> first<00:03:07.269> one

00:03:07.800 --> 00:03:07.810 
opinion are the worst ones first one

00:03:07.810 --> 00:03:10.860 
opinion are the worst ones first one
wreath<00:03:08.019> whatever<00:03:08.349> reason<00:03:08.739> or<00:03:08.859> another<00:03:09.870> that

00:03:10.860 --> 00:03:10.870 
wreath whatever reason or another that

00:03:10.870 --> 00:03:12.720 
wreath whatever reason or another that
one<00:03:10.989> seems<00:03:11.439> to<00:03:11.620> be<00:03:11.709> turning<00:03:11.859> as<00:03:12.220> much<00:03:12.400> a<00:03:12.430> bad

00:03:12.720 --> 00:03:12.730 
one seems to be turning as much a bad

00:03:12.730 --> 00:03:18.770 
one seems to be turning as much a bad
word<00:03:12.879> and<00:03:14.040> there's<00:03:15.150> powderly<00:03:16.150> return

00:03:18.770 --> 00:03:18.780 

00:03:18.780 --> 00:03:22.340 

porn<00:03:19.470> pieces<00:03:19.890> are<00:03:20.750> all<00:03:21.750> the<00:03:21.900> outer<00:03:22.050> layers

00:03:22.340 --> 00:03:22.350 
porn pieces are all the outer layers

00:03:22.350 --> 00:03:24.980 
porn pieces are all the outer layers
themselves<00:03:23.010> are<00:03:23.190> bigger<00:03:24.000> than<00:03:24.300> the<00:03:24.959> other

00:03:24.980 --> 00:03:24.990 
themselves are bigger than the other

00:03:24.990 --> 00:03:27.530 
themselves are bigger than the other
layers<00:03:25.380> so<00:03:25.860> it's<00:03:26.700> easy<00:03:26.910> a<00:03:27.000> little<00:03:27.090> easier<00:03:27.480> on

00:03:27.530 --> 00:03:27.540 
layers so it's easy a little easier on

00:03:27.540 --> 00:03:29.570 
layers so it's easy a little easier on
your<00:03:27.690> hands<00:03:28.020> on<00:03:28.230> the<00:03:28.620> middle<00:03:29.100> layers<00:03:29.280> are

00:03:29.570 --> 00:03:29.580 
your hands on the middle layers are

00:03:29.580 --> 00:03:32.180 
your hands on the middle layers are
seven<00:03:30.110> millimeter<00:03:31.110> square<00:03:31.470> each<00:03:31.950> of<00:03:32.100> the

00:03:32.180 --> 00:03:32.190 
seven millimeter square each of the

00:03:32.190 --> 00:03:34.160 
seven millimeter square each of the
faces<00:03:32.520> are<00:03:32.670> seven<00:03:33.000> millimeters<00:03:33.390> and<00:03:33.569> the

00:03:34.160 --> 00:03:34.170 
faces are seven millimeters and the

00:03:34.170 --> 00:03:36.680 
faces are seven millimeters and the
outer<00:03:34.319> layer<00:03:34.530> 4<00:03:34.740> 10<00:03:35.010> millimeters<00:03:35.430> so<00:03:35.850> as<00:03:36.120> you

00:03:36.680 --> 00:03:36.690 
outer layer 4 10 millimeters so as you

00:03:36.690 --> 00:03:38.570 
outer layer 4 10 millimeters so as you
can<00:03:36.780> see<00:03:36.930> that<00:03:36.959> actually<00:03:37.319> gives<00:03:37.590> the<00:03:38.280> corner

00:03:38.570 --> 00:03:38.580 
can see that actually gives the corner

00:03:38.580 --> 00:03:41.300 
can see that actually gives the corner
piece<00:03:38.760> quite<00:03:39.480> a<00:03:39.510> lot<00:03:39.690> of<00:03:39.750> room<00:03:40.020> to<00:03:40.260> lock<00:03:41.130> into

00:03:41.300 --> 00:03:41.310 
piece quite a lot of room to lock into

00:03:41.310 --> 00:03:46.430 
piece quite a lot of room to lock into
the<00:03:41.459> puzzle<00:03:43.010> so<00:03:44.300> this<00:03:45.300> is<00:03:45.330> all<00:03:45.569> right<00:03:45.690> by<00:03:45.840> you<00:03:46.200> I

before they get a chance to mass produce

00:04:08.519 --> 00:04:10.460 
before they get a chance to mass produce
there's<00:04:09.000> if<00:04:09.090> they<00:04:09.660> are<00:04:09.780> going<00:04:09.900> mass-producing

00:04:10.460 --> 00:04:10.470 
there's if they are going mass-producing

00:04:10.470 --> 00:04:15.110
