00:00:15.720 --> 00:00:19.449
 I absolutely needed a brace 

00:00:17.980 --> 00:00:21.550
 So I have as a kid ever 

00:00:19.449 --> 00:00:23.050
 had a braces but the teeth 

00:00:21.550 --> 00:00:27.160
 have meanwhile become very happy again 

00:00:23.050 --> 00:00:28.210
 moved and if you are so middle 30 

00:00:27.160 --> 00:00:31.300
 and is again a zahnspange 

00:00:28.210 --> 00:00:32.559
 antun would like to think about it already 

00:00:31.300 --> 00:00:34.840
 You take a braces that way 

00:00:32.559 --> 00:00:37.540
 see or if there is the possibility 

00:00:34.840 --> 00:00:39.399
 that you have almost invisible braces 

00:00:37.540 --> 00:00:42.640
 Of course you also like to choose the 

00:00:39.399 --> 00:00:44.770
 invisalign he is a concept of himself 

00:00:42.640 --> 00:00:47.800
 composed of two words invisible 

00:00:44.770 --> 00:00:49.810
 and what alone as much as invisible 

00:00:47.800 --> 00:00:52.050
 To straighten should therefore mean the 

00:00:49.810 --> 00:00:54.310
 difference to a conventional one 

00:00:52.050 --> 00:00:56.020
 braces so i had all 

00:00:54.310 --> 00:00:57.460
 different types of braces than 

00:00:56.020 --> 00:00:59.050
 child was the worst for me 

00:00:57.460 --> 00:01:00.970
 actually then so this outside bow 

00:00:59.050 --> 00:01:02.680
 that one really only too much one 

00:01:00.970 --> 00:01:04.089
 beats and then that was of course like that 

00:01:02.680 --> 00:01:07.030
 the most striking thing there is 

00:01:04.089 --> 00:01:09.700
 and it is naturally moderate as a teenager 

00:01:07.030 --> 00:01:10.979
 pleasant to walk around so it was 

00:01:09.700 --> 00:01:14.590
 not very nice and then of course 

00:01:10.979 --> 00:01:16.659
 Invisalign contrasts with this simply extreme 

00:01:14.590 --> 00:01:21.670
 inconspicuous and and simply one 

00:01:16.659 --> 00:01:23.380
 Application not much like or as in am 

00:01:21.670 --> 00:01:26.740
 gums with a fixed braces 

00:01:23.380 --> 00:01:28.119
 indeed often does that was just very pleasant to 

00:01:26.740 --> 00:01:31.240
 wear and it just does not fall 

00:01:28.119 --> 00:01:32.710
 that's how they look and each ski 

00:01:31.240 --> 00:01:34.990
 A little piece is different 

00:01:32.710 --> 00:01:37.479
 from the previous rail there is 

00:01:34.990 --> 00:01:41.080
 a whole series of braces the 

00:01:37.479 --> 00:01:43.479
 would all be produced in advance 

00:01:41.080 --> 00:01:46.330
 a simulation of the dent of the 

00:01:43.479 --> 00:01:49.270
 patients over a three-dimensional 

00:01:46.330 --> 00:01:52.510
 software and every rail moves that 

00:01:49.270 --> 00:01:55.119
 tooth on average about 0 25 millimeters 

00:01:52.510 --> 00:01:56.350
 continue and after two weeks you change 

00:01:55.119 --> 00:01:57.520
 then the next one appeared and the 

00:01:56.350 --> 00:01:59.560
 pushes the car back a bit 

00:01:57.520 --> 00:02:01.270
 continue pretending pay what 

00:01:59.560 --> 00:02:02.799
 which direction should be moved 

00:02:01.270 --> 00:02:04.930
 gives the orthodontist the doctor 

00:02:02.799 --> 00:02:07.650
 then sit in front of and at the company 

00:02:04.930 --> 00:02:09.899
 technicians do that in the software 

00:02:07.650 --> 00:02:12.420
 then implement that simulation then 

00:02:09.899 --> 00:02:14.370
 It is very common to see us performing 

00:02:12.420 --> 00:02:19.100
 Treatment in the front tooth area by at 

00:02:14.370 --> 00:02:21.180
 narrowed turned ten standing 

00:02:19.100 --> 00:02:23.550
 nested teeth like us 

00:02:21.180 --> 00:02:25.260
 For example, see it here 

00:02:23.550 --> 00:02:28.200
 upper lateral right incisor is 

00:02:25.260 --> 00:02:31.860
 all the way to the inside to the side 

00:02:28.200 --> 00:02:33.440
 hiked such patients often suffer 

00:02:31.860 --> 00:02:35.720
 also to functional disorders 

00:02:33.440 --> 00:02:37.260
 headache symptomatology who to call there 

00:02:35.720 --> 00:02:39.150
 tension neck area 

00:02:37.260 --> 00:02:40.890
 shoulder area to knee pain 

00:02:39.150 --> 00:02:42.690
 can through such many contacts 

00:02:40.890 --> 00:02:45.540
 it will not be triggered that way 

00:02:42.690 --> 00:02:47.370
 known and takes this functional 

00:02:45.540 --> 00:02:49.560
 Disorders benefit the patients 

00:02:47.370 --> 00:02:51.709
 Of course, it is clear that they 

00:02:49.560 --> 00:02:54.900
 the teeth can care much better 

00:02:51.709 --> 00:02:56.910
 here is the simulation of his teeth 

00:02:54.900 --> 00:02:58.350
 as they are in 3d software like that 

00:02:56.910 --> 00:03:00.690
 look called clean chic 

00:02:58.350 --> 00:03:03.209
 that was the situation at the beginning of the 

00:03:00.690 --> 00:03:05.970
 treatment and now we can once 

00:03:03.209 --> 00:03:07.980
 let the simulation run like that 

00:03:05.970 --> 00:03:10.140
 the teeth move like that 

00:03:07.980 --> 00:03:11.280
 front teeth are moved back and the 

00:03:10.140 --> 00:03:13.500
 gaps are closed 

00:03:11.280 --> 00:03:16.470
 the main argument was that I stop 

00:03:13.500 --> 00:03:19.140
 Actors and sometimes it is 

00:03:16.470 --> 00:03:20.640
 stop synonymous so relatively old movies the 

00:03:19.140 --> 00:03:22.950
 maybe partly in the 16 

00:03:20.640 --> 00:03:25.190
 play century and then stop 

00:03:22.950 --> 00:03:27.959
 do not bake to fixed braces so 

00:03:25.190 --> 00:03:29.760
 fitting because it did not exist then 

00:03:27.959 --> 00:03:30.720
 and you can easily take it out 

00:03:29.760 --> 00:03:32.519
 that's why we have it for the 

00:03:30.720 --> 00:03:34.230
 So nee decided to speak 

00:03:32.519 --> 00:03:35.700
 That does not bother me at all that 

00:03:34.230 --> 00:03:37.200
 is as if I speak again yes 

00:03:35.700 --> 00:03:42.180
 did they just in it 

00:03:37.200 --> 00:03:43.769
 So yes, believe that is not so 

00:03:42.180 --> 00:03:46.500
 noticed so if we times we 

00:03:43.769 --> 00:03:48.720
 we see one so far 

00:03:46.500 --> 00:03:52.220
 rail intended for adults 

00:03:48.720 --> 00:03:55.090
 completely transparent and here we see one 

00:03:52.220 --> 00:03:56.860
 leg splint for teenagers 

00:03:55.090 --> 00:03:59.530
 thought is what is the difference 

00:03:56.860 --> 00:04:01.269
 For one thing, they notice here is one 

00:03:59.530 --> 00:04:04.569
 little blue dot that one like that 

00:04:01.269 --> 00:04:07.420
 said wearing indicator because it can 

00:04:04.569 --> 00:04:08.860
 here comes the situation that the 

00:04:07.420 --> 00:04:10.690
 Adolescents perhaps the braces 

00:04:08.860 --> 00:04:12.730
 does not wear so much and then you can 

00:04:10.690 --> 00:04:15.760
 We exactly on the color of the point 

00:04:12.730 --> 00:04:17.380
 the braces will look adequate 

00:04:15.760 --> 00:04:18.790
 Number of hours worn throughout the day 

00:04:17.380 --> 00:04:19.930
 or not and then can on the 

00:04:18.790 --> 00:04:21.760
 interact with patients 

00:04:19.930 --> 00:04:24.340
 another special feature in the 

00:04:21.760 --> 00:04:25.900
 braces for the teens is that if 

00:04:24.340 --> 00:04:28.200
 you can lose a clasp 

00:04:25.900 --> 00:04:30.370
 Should be a limited number 

00:04:28.200 --> 00:04:32.830
 reorder free reorder 

00:04:30.370 --> 00:04:36.130
 can and is a third feature 

00:04:32.830 --> 00:04:38.110
 that there are possibilities so 

00:04:36.130 --> 00:04:40.090
 also the tooth change in the age 

00:04:38.110 --> 00:04:41.669
 takes place there to be considered 

00:04:40.090 --> 00:04:43.750
 it's called a small breakthrough 

00:04:41.669 --> 00:04:45.400
 compensatory where the tooth is then 

00:04:43.750 --> 00:04:47.050
 The situation can also grow purely 

00:04:45.400 --> 00:04:49.570
 we have with the adult patient 

00:04:47.050 --> 00:04:52.560
 not really the advantages of one 

00:04:49.570 --> 00:04:54.940
 braces is above all the cleaning 

00:04:52.560 --> 00:04:57.970
 much easier faster 

00:04:54.940 --> 00:04:58.510
 So my life is actually quite normal 

00:04:57.970 --> 00:05:01.780
 teeth 

00:04:58.510 --> 00:05:03.940
 So take out brushing again 

00:05:01.780 --> 00:05:05.200
 So do the really not quality 

00:05:03.940 --> 00:05:09.000
 So what I mean sometimes 

00:05:05.200 --> 00:05:11.740
 girlfriends higher with fixed braces 

00:05:09.000 --> 00:05:14.050
 way too complicated and for a long time I believe 

00:05:11.740 --> 00:05:16.180
 then you become more careless than 

00:05:14.050 --> 00:05:18.940
 Now with this one for a layman 

00:05:16.180 --> 00:05:21.490
 I would say that is quite inconspicuous 

00:05:18.940 --> 00:05:23.200
 that is not noticed by one 

00:05:21.490 --> 00:05:25.810
 if you are with one 

00:05:23.200 --> 00:05:27.970
 Dentist talk 

00:05:25.810 --> 00:05:30.610
 but probably remember that 

00:05:27.970 --> 00:05:32.229
 normal man does not notice that no what 

00:05:30.610 --> 00:05:33.610
 that's the teeth shiny maybe 

00:05:32.229 --> 00:05:35.020
 simply more what many patients 

00:05:33.610 --> 00:05:36.849
 They really like it 

00:05:35.020 --> 00:05:39.550
 no more about her toes always like that 

00:05:36.849 --> 00:05:43.050
 beautiful shine no that's really that 

00:05:39.550 --> 00:05:43.050
 inconspicuous which there are
