00:02:05.490 --> 00:02:09.979 
first thing I'm going to do is change my
background<00:02:06.119> I<00:02:06.390> have<00:02:06.899> some<00:02:08.810> graphics<00:02:09.810> that<00:02:09.929> I

00:02:09.979 --> 00:02:09.989 
background I have some graphics that I

00:02:09.989 --> 00:02:13.850 
background I have some graphics that I
created<00:02:10.739> in<00:02:11.009> /<00:02:12.140> Photoshop

00:02:13.850 --> 00:02:13.860 
created in / Photoshop

00:02:13.860 --> 00:02:16.330 
created in / Photoshop
going<00:02:14.100> to<00:02:14.190> get<00:02:14.850> that<00:02:15.060> they<00:02:15.360> get<00:02:15.570> connected<00:02:16.020> one

00:02:16.330 --> 00:02:16.340 
going to get that they get connected one

00:02:16.340 --> 00:02:20.030 
going to get that they get connected one
now<00:02:17.340> in<00:02:18.270> this<00:02:18.510> case<00:02:18.570> the<00:02:19.110> graphic<00:02:19.530> is<00:02:19.650> the<00:02:19.800> same

00:02:20.030 --> 00:02:20.040 
now in this case the graphic is the same

00:02:20.040 --> 00:02:22.610 
now in this case the graphic is the same
size<00:02:20.310> that<00:02:20.640> I<00:02:20.670> just<00:02:20.970> made<00:02:21.180> but<00:02:22.050> if<00:02:22.170> I<00:02:22.260> put<00:02:22.500> up

00:02:22.610 --> 00:02:22.620 
size that I just made but if I put up

00:02:22.620 --> 00:02:24.860 
size that I just made but if I put up
something<00:02:22.890> that<00:02:23.340> was<00:02:23.970> smaller<00:02:24.270> it<00:02:24.630> would<00:02:24.660> have

00:02:24.860 --> 00:02:24.870 
something that was smaller it would have

00:02:24.870 --> 00:02:27.200 
something that was smaller it would have
repeated<00:02:25.410> so<00:02:25.680> i<00:02:25.950> could<00:02:26.490> go<00:02:26.640> on<00:02:26.670> the<00:02:26.970> change

00:02:27.200 --> 00:02:27.210 
repeated so i could go on the change

00:02:27.210 --> 00:02:29.900 
repeated so i could go on the change
background<00:02:27.510> and<00:02:28.110> make<00:02:28.890> sure<00:02:28.920> that<00:02:29.550> i<00:02:29.580> have

00:02:29.900 --> 00:02:29.910 
background and make sure that i have

00:02:29.910 --> 00:02:32.870 
background and make sure that i have
this<00:02:30.150> set<00:02:30.420> to<00:02:30.570> no<00:02:30.750> repeat<00:02:31.230> into<00:02:32.160> my<00:02:32.310> position

00:02:32.870 --> 00:02:32.880 
this set to no repeat into my position

00:02:32.880 --> 00:02:36.890 
this set to no repeat into my position
to<00:02:33.270> be<00:02:33.450> left<00:02:34.050> top<00:02:35.390> next<00:02:36.390> thing<00:02:36.510> i<00:02:36.540> want<00:02:36.570> to<00:02:36.750> work

customize<00:03:15.989> it<00:03:16.170> a<00:03:16.200> little<00:03:16.380> bit<00:03:17.030> for<00:03:18.030> example<00:03:18.420> if

00:03:18.500 --> 00:03:18.510 
customize it a little bit for example if

00:03:18.510 --> 00:03:20.360

00:03:23.210 --> 00:03:23.220 
that so I could put some highlighting

00:03:23.220 --> 00:03:25.070 
that so I could put some highlighting
behind<00:03:23.730> that<00:03:23.910> if<00:03:24.120> I<00:03:24.209> wanted<00:03:24.480> to<00:03:24.570> but<00:03:24.810> I'm<00:03:24.900> just

00:03:25.070 --> 00:03:25.080 
behind that if I wanted to but I'm just

00:03:25.080 --> 00:03:26.810 
behind that if I wanted to but I'm just
going<00:03:25.200> to<00:03:25.230> leave<00:03:25.470> it<00:03:25.500> with<00:03:25.950> the<00:03:26.100> black<00:03:26.340> like<00:03:26.670> I

00:03:26.810 --> 00:03:26.820 
going to leave it with the black like I

00:03:26.820 --> 00:03:28.850 
going to leave it with the black like I
created<00:03:27.209> it<00:03:27.390> I<00:03:27.570> can<00:03:28.080> also<00:03:28.200> use<00:03:28.470> these<00:03:28.709> sliders

00:03:28.850 --> 00:03:28.860 
created it I can also use these sliders

00:03:28.860 --> 00:03:30.890 
created it I can also use these sliders
to<00:03:29.310> move<00:03:29.459> it<00:03:29.580> a<00:03:29.640> little<00:03:29.670> bit<00:03:30.000> move<00:03:30.510> it<00:03:30.630> up<00:03:30.750> or

00:03:30.890 --> 00:03:30.900 
to move it a little bit move it up or

00:03:30.900 --> 00:03:33.500 
to move it a little bit move it up or
down<00:03:31.580> maybe<00:03:32.580> create<00:03:32.970> a<00:03:33.000> little<00:03:33.239> bit<00:03:33.360> more

00:03:33.500 --> 00:03:33.510 
down maybe create a little bit more

00:03:33.510 --> 00:03:37.310 
down maybe create a little bit more
space<00:03:33.870> on<00:03:34.110> the<00:03:34.260> right<00:03:35.299> so<00:03:36.299> that<00:03:36.480> button<00:03:36.870> it

00:03:37.310 --> 00:03:37.320 
space on the right so that button it

00:03:37.320 --> 00:03:40.729 
space on the right so that button it
does<00:03:37.560> go<00:03:37.739> over<00:03:38.010> that<00:03:38.130> button<00:03:38.489> and<00:03:39.620> other<00:03:40.620> than

00:03:40.729 --> 00:03:40.739 
does go over that button and other than

00:03:40.739 --> 00:03:42.920 
does go over that button and other than
that<00:03:40.860> I<00:03:40.890> think<00:03:41.010> it's<00:03:41.250> positioned<00:03:41.730> fine<00:03:41.970> so

00:03:42.920 --> 00:03:42.930 
that I think it's positioned fine so

00:03:42.930 --> 00:03:44.750 
that I think it's positioned fine so
let's<00:03:43.110> apply<00:03:43.260> the<00:03:43.470> changes<00:03:43.950> and<00:03:44.010> see<00:03:44.340> what<00:03:44.610> we

00:03:44.750 --> 00:03:44.760 
let's apply the changes and see what we

00:03:53.479 --> 00:03:53.489 
hopefully it'll add a mate to the next

00:03:53.489 --> 00:03:56.660 
hopefully it'll add a mate to the next
one<00:03:53.640> and<00:03:53.880> of<00:03:54.000> course<00:03:54.030> that<00:03:54.360> slides<00:03:54.660> blank<00:03:55.670> ok
