00:00:08.510 --> 00:00:14.780
 good afternoon now let's learn 

00:00:10.760 --> 00:00:17.450
 how to download the weiss application in 

00:00:14.780 --> 00:00:19.490
 store play be 

00:00:17.450 --> 00:00:24.050
 then we write the name of the 

00:00:19.490 --> 00:00:25.430
 application here we appear and we give to 

00:00:24.050 --> 00:00:28.090
 the first window that appears 

00:00:25.430 --> 00:00:32.370
 immediately install 

00:00:28.090 --> 00:00:32.370
 we accept google permissions 

00:00:32.710 --> 00:00:38.399
 and we started to start the download as 

00:00:36.430 --> 00:00:40.840
 we realize here is a tutorial 

00:00:38.399 --> 00:00:43.480
 this tutorial is super complete 

00:00:40.840 --> 00:00:46.629
 explains each function that this 

00:00:43.480 --> 00:00:51.750
 application then we can so 

00:00:46.629 --> 00:00:51.750
 later observe it through youtube 

00:00:52.000 --> 00:00:56.770
 here we can also qualify it through 

00:00:54.370 --> 00:01:00.570
 of the stars we can qualify that 

00:00:56.770 --> 00:01:03.870
 We both like it 11 15 

00:01:00.570 --> 00:01:06.640
 you also tell us the news 

00:01:03.870 --> 00:01:10.930
 the list of friends who use it 

00:01:06.640 --> 00:01:14.340
 the description of the page that already arrives 

00:01:10.930 --> 00:01:14.340
 to more than 50 million users 

00:01:14.390 --> 00:01:20.420
 the comments here for example we see 

00:01:16.760 --> 00:01:23.280
 that has five stars and that its 

00:01:20.420 --> 00:01:26.250
 rating is in a 46 

00:01:23.280 --> 00:01:29.580
 It is a very good rating and also 

00:01:26.250 --> 00:01:31.110
 we see the comments this application is 

00:01:29.580 --> 00:01:34.140
 very good 

00:01:31.110 --> 00:01:37.770
 yes yes we are suddenly yes we are going to do 

00:01:34.140 --> 00:01:40.740
 a tour perhaps you who travel 

00:01:37.770 --> 00:01:42.570
 in a constant way be very good because 

00:01:40.740 --> 00:01:45.340
 tells them where there are policemen in 

00:01:42.570 --> 00:01:50.039
 where there are gas pumps 

00:01:45.340 --> 00:01:53.549
 where can you find holes 

00:01:50.039 --> 00:01:57.069
 then this application is very complete 

00:01:53.549 --> 00:01:59.289
 and if you can not record them 

00:01:57.069 --> 00:02:02.319
 work routes to the house and he 

00:01:59.289 --> 00:02:03.969
 indicates where there is less traffic and 

00:02:02.319 --> 00:02:06.909
 what is the fastest way to 

00:02:03.969 --> 00:02:09.459
 get to your destination 

00:02:06.909 --> 00:02:12.200
 You can also choose the model of 

00:02:09.459 --> 00:02:14.690
 car that uses 

00:02:12.200 --> 00:02:16.730
 ready then here is already installing the 

00:02:14.690 --> 00:02:18.019
 terminal mind application install I follow 

00:02:16.730 --> 00:02:20.540
 counting you can choose the color 

00:02:18.019 --> 00:02:22.730
 of the car and as if the green red the 

00:02:20.540 --> 00:02:24.819
 model and more or less it will appear like this 

00:02:22.730 --> 00:02:29.670
 what you see here 

00:02:24.819 --> 00:02:29.670
 then we will look for the application 

00:02:30.930 --> 00:02:35.470
 let's see if it already appeared 

00:02:33.810 --> 00:02:37.810
 [Music] 

00:02:35.470 --> 00:02:40.180
 it's a little heavy and it works 

00:02:37.810 --> 00:02:42.910
 only with internet in this case 

00:02:40.180 --> 00:02:45.280
 because he was not yet installing 

00:02:42.910 --> 00:02:47.040
 If they do not say it here, he knew what happened 

00:02:45.280 --> 00:02:50.380
 so good you can also 

00:02:47.040 --> 00:02:53.170
 turn off the application when they are not 

00:02:50.380 --> 00:02:54.730
 using then well with the sun to 

00:02:53.170 --> 00:02:56.980
 can save a little more battery 

00:02:54.730 --> 00:02:59.020
 as I said it works only with internet 

00:02:56.980 --> 00:03:04.650
 As everyone has data it will not have 

00:02:59.020 --> 00:03:04.650
 no problem ready we look for it 

00:03:07.580 --> 00:03:11.600
 as I said it is very important that you 

00:03:09.200 --> 00:03:14.350
 see the tutorial they explain everything so 

00:03:11.600 --> 00:03:14.350
 very specific 

00:03:14.420 --> 00:03:21.070
 then we will proceed to observe 

00:03:18.550 --> 00:03:24.150
 the weiss application that is 

00:03:21.070 --> 00:03:24.150
 relatively new 

00:03:24.210 --> 00:03:28.420
 can be connected as yesterday with the 

00:03:26.040 --> 00:03:31.599
 Facebook friends 

00:03:28.420 --> 00:03:37.230
 to see that they use it can be 

00:03:31.599 --> 00:03:37.230
 publish states this kind of thing 

00:03:38.140 --> 00:03:46.160
 let's proceed walking we accept it 

00:03:42.350 --> 00:03:49.580
 the agreement that tell us ready as 

00:03:46.160 --> 00:03:52.450
 we are new users here we can see 

00:03:49.580 --> 00:03:52.450
 also a tutorial 

00:03:53.970 --> 00:04:00.660
 then here he tells us that we are a 

00:03:56.000 --> 00:04:02.730
 weiser see is what it's called 

00:04:00.660 --> 00:04:04.050
 ready then here tells us the 

00:04:02.730 --> 00:04:07.080
 location at this moment we are in 

00:04:04.050 --> 00:04:09.600
 parent company in model already tells us here 

00:04:07.080 --> 00:04:12.140
 how many waiters are connected in this 

00:04:09.600 --> 00:04:12.140
 moment 

00:04:14.069 --> 00:04:22.320
 and it also indicates us in this hand that is 

00:04:18.900 --> 00:04:24.600
 if the traffic is in accident of 

00:04:22.320 --> 00:04:26.130
 camera is danger police is super 

00:04:24.600 --> 00:04:29.850
 complete is a very very tool 

00:04:26.130 --> 00:04:31.889
 good in this other one because we can what 

00:04:29.850 --> 00:04:34.620
 I told them in the ones I said before 

00:04:31.889 --> 00:04:37.050
 we can see where there are gas pumps 

00:04:34.620 --> 00:04:39.000
 let's see messages we can include the 

00:04:37.050 --> 00:04:40.700
 navigation from where we are going to 

00:04:39.000 --> 00:04:43.430
 where are we going 

00:04:40.700 --> 00:04:45.390
 and finally we can turn off the 

00:04:43.430 --> 00:04:48.300
 application 

00:04:45.390 --> 00:04:50.430
 that's it then please see the 

00:04:48.300 --> 00:04:54.470
 tutorial that appears on youtube or the 

00:04:50.430 --> 00:04:54.470
 I approve in the application of weiss
