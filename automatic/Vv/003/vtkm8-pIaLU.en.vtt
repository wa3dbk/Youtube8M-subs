as well now I find this very useful for

00:06:08.180 --> 00:06:10.870 
as well now I find this very useful for
summer<00:06:08.540> weather<00:06:08.930> gear<00:06:09.230> extra<00:06:10.070> tackle<00:06:10.520> but

air<00:06:54.510> to<00:06:54.570> pass<00:06:54.900> through<00:06:55.110> so<00:06:55.620> you<00:06:55.740> don't<00:06:55.770> sit<00:06:56.190> in

00:06:56.330 --> 00:06:56.340 
air to pass through so you don't sit in

the<00:06:56.460> seat<00:06:56.700> and<00:06:56.940> sweat<00:06:57.240> but<00:06:57.630> it<00:06:57.690> also<00:06:57.840> means

00:06:58.130 --> 00:06:58.140 
the seat and sweat but it also means

00:06:58.140 --> 00:06:59.930 
the seat and sweat but it also means
that<00:06:58.380> if<00:06:58.470> you<00:06:58.590> do<00:06:58.770> get<00:06:58.980> water<00:06:59.160> over<00:06:59.610> the<00:06:59.730> side

00:06:59.930 --> 00:06:59.940 
that if you do get water over the side

00:06:59.940 --> 00:07:01.850 
that if you do get water over the side
or<00:07:00.270> it<00:07:00.420> starts<00:07:00.780> raining<00:07:00.990> you'll<00:07:01.470> be<00:07:01.560> sitting

00:07:01.850 --> 00:07:01.860 
or it starts raining you'll be sitting

00:07:04.400 --> 00:07:04.410 
on a nice dry seat all day long now it's

00:07:04.410 --> 00:07:06.920 
on a nice dry seat all day long now it's
quite<00:07:04.590> a<00:07:04.620> big<00:07:04.920> car<00:07:05.130> Greg<00:07:05.460> would<00:07:05.910> it<00:07:06.030> be<00:07:06.360> hard<00:07:06.750> to

00:07:06.920 --> 00:07:06.930 
quite a big car Greg would it be hard to

00:07:06.930 --> 00:07:09.500 
quite a big car Greg would it be hard to
load<00:07:07.110> onto<00:07:07.350> a<00:07:07.530> vehicle<00:07:07.830> no<00:07:08.460> not<00:07:08.940> at<00:07:09.090> all

load onto a vehicle no not at all

00:07:09.510 --> 00:07:11.390 
load onto a vehicle no not at all
I<00:07:09.540> do<00:07:10.110> find<00:07:10.530> this<00:07:10.620> quite<00:07:10.920> probably<00:07:11.280> the

00:07:11.390 --> 00:07:11.400 
I do find this quite probably the

00:07:11.400 --> 00:07:13.160 
I do find this quite probably the
easiest<00:07:11.760> one<00:07:11.970> to<00:07:12.150> load<00:07:12.330> on<00:07:12.480> onto<00:07:12.900> the<00:07:12.960> top<00:07:13.140> of

00:07:19.550 --> 00:07:19.560 
lift the whole kayak up you just lift

00:07:19.560 --> 00:07:22.010 
lift the whole kayak up you just lift
