00:00:02.790 --> 00:00:05.410
 this kind of easy to get used to 

00:00:05.410 --> 00:00:07.590
 image quality 

00:00:07.590 --> 00:00:10.170
 I am an ordinary guy 

00:00:10.170 --> 00:00:13.619
 the rest 

00:00:13.619 --> 00:00:15.679
 prim 

00:00:15.679 --> 00:00:18.659
 I found great places to hide 

00:00:18.659 --> 00:00:21.659
 if it was here 

00:00:23.439 --> 00:00:25.099
 so much desire 

00:00:25.099 --> 00:00:27.439
 if you have already received 

00:00:27.439 --> 00:00:29.919
 and what to do and clean deal with a deal 

00:00:29.919 --> 00:00:32.060
 parents 

00:00:32.060 --> 00:00:33.680
 I want to see stronger 

00:00:33.680 --> 00:00:35.710
 tired of looking around with the first 

00:00:35.710 --> 00:00:38.710
 said for no reason 

00:00:40.990 --> 00:00:43.990
 on the contrary said direct 

00:00:45.880 --> 00:00:47.030
 on 2 9 

00:00:47.030 --> 00:00:50.030
 population 

00:00:52.510 --> 00:00:53.700
 i don't like me 

00:00:53.700 --> 00:00:55.290
 he suggested that I was not anyone here 

00:00:55.290 --> 00:00:58.290
 don't like buddhas 

00:01:01.060 --> 00:01:04.030
 so what else do i have to drivers 

00:01:04.030 --> 00:01:06.270
 head of the secretariat 

00:01:06.270 --> 00:01:09.270
 we all know what to own person 

00:01:11.390 --> 00:01:13.530
 with this wonderful 

00:01:13.530 --> 00:01:15.130
 and the guests were offered 

00:01:15.130 --> 00:01:18.130
 imagine 

00:01:19.260 --> 00:01:21.250
 all my life I've been waiting for this day 

00:01:21.250 --> 00:01:23.280
 whole system 

00:01:23.280 --> 00:01:26.280
 on Friday 

00:01:29.120 --> 00:01:31.370
 she noted that today none of them 

00:01:31.370 --> 00:01:34.370
 did not call 

00:01:36.700 --> 00:01:39.700
 completed already 

00:01:46.440 --> 00:01:48.280
 probably today is the day but ordinary 

00:01:48.280 --> 00:01:51.280
 don't win 

00:01:52.950 --> 00:01:54.540
 but a woman 

00:01:54.540 --> 00:01:55.490
 of course 

00:01:55.490 --> 00:01:56.700
 because you need 

00:01:56.700 --> 00:01:57.639
 versions spoke
