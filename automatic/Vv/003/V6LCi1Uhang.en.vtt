that's<00:04:07.840> interesting<00:04:07.960> they've<00:04:08.290> implemented

00:04:08.730 --> 00:04:08.740 
that's interesting they've implemented

00:04:08.740 --> 00:04:10.740 
that's interesting they've implemented
some<00:04:09.010> technology<00:04:09.550> that<00:04:09.730> allow<00:04:10.270> the<00:04:10.360> battery

00:04:10.740 --> 00:04:10.750 
some technology that allow the battery

00:04:10.750 --> 00:04:13.290 
some technology that allow the battery
to<00:04:11.020> be<00:04:11.140> recharged<00:04:11.890> way<00:04:12.280> more<00:04:12.550> than<00:04:12.760> most<00:04:12.970> it'll

00:04:13.290 --> 00:04:13.300 
to be recharged way more than most it'll

00:04:13.300 --> 00:04:15.090 
to be recharged way more than most it'll
retain<00:04:13.959> up<00:04:14.230> to<00:04:14.350> eighty<00:04:14.560> percent<00:04:14.770> of<00:04:14.980> its

00:04:15.090 --> 00:04:15.100 
retain up to eighty percent of its

00:04:15.100 --> 00:04:18.630 
retain up to eighty percent of its
charge<00:04:15.430> for<00:04:15.790> up<00:04:16.359> to<00:04:16.690> 1,000<00:04:17.410> charges<00:04:17.859> so<00:04:18.459> that's

00:04:18.630 --> 00:04:18.640 
charge for up to 1,000 charges so that's

00:04:18.640 --> 00:04:20.729 
charge for up to 1,000 charges so that's
way<00:04:19.390> better<00:04:19.570> battery<00:04:19.959> life<00:04:19.989> than<00:04:20.290> most<00:04:20.440> and

00:04:20.729 --> 00:04:20.739 
way better battery life than most and

00:04:20.739 --> 00:04:22.650 
way better battery life than most and
again<00:04:21.430> did<00:04:21.760> I<00:04:21.820> mention<00:04:22.060> the<00:04:22.120> screen<00:04:22.360> yet<00:04:22.510> the
