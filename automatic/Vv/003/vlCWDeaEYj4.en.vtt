much more and very musically interesting
the<00:00:27.520> D<00:00:27.759> chord<00:00:28.349> is<00:00:29.349> really<00:00:29.829> the<00:00:30.489> place<00:00:30.730> to<00:00:30.759> start

00:00:30.990 --> 00:00:31.000 
the D chord is really the place to start

00:00:31.000 --> 00:00:33.150 
the D chord is really the place to start
when<00:00:31.750> you<00:00:31.869> want<00:00:32.050> to<00:00:32.079> start<00:00:32.349> doing<00:00:32.559> some<00:00:33.130> things

00:00:33.150 --> 00:00:33.160 
when you want to start doing some things

when you want to start doing some things
that<00:00:33.460> are<00:00:33.610> just<00:00:33.760> a<00:00:33.880> little<00:00:33.910> bit<00:00:34.180> more

00:00:34.290 --> 00:00:34.300 
that are just a little bit more

00:00:34.300 --> 00:00:37.139 
that are just a little bit more
interesting<00:00:34.750> but<00:00:34.930> don't<00:00:35.140> take<00:00:35.579> art<00:00:36.579> daunting

00:00:37.139 --> 00:00:37.149 
interesting but don't take art daunting

00:00:37.149 --> 00:00:38.490 
interesting but don't take art daunting
in<00:00:37.329> terms<00:00:37.600> of<00:00:37.780> what<00:00:37.929> you<00:00:38.019> need<00:00:38.050> to<00:00:38.199> know<00:00:38.440> to

00:00:38.490 --> 00:00:38.500 
in terms of what you need to know to

00:00:40.650 --> 00:00:40.660 
make it sound more interesting in this

00:00:40.660 --> 00:00:42.720 
make it sound more interesting in this
lesson<00:00:40.899> we're<00:00:41.379> going<00:00:41.530> to<00:00:41.620> look<00:00:41.859> at<00:00:42.100> two

00:00:42.720 --> 00:00:42.730 
lesson we're going to look at two

00:00:42.730 --> 00:00:44.790 
lesson we're going to look at two
different<00:00:42.760> ways<00:00:43.179> you<00:00:43.210> can<00:00:43.539> modify<00:00:43.839> the<00:00:44.199> D<00:00:44.559> in

00:00:44.790 --> 00:00:44.800 
different ways you can modify the D in

00:00:44.800 --> 00:00:47.340 
different ways you can modify the D in
order<00:00:45.370> to<00:00:45.670> to<00:00:46.600> make<00:00:46.629> it<00:00:46.899> a<00:00:46.960> little<00:00:47.050> bit<00:00:47.260> more

00:00:47.340 --> 00:00:47.350 
order to to make it a little bit more

00:00:47.350 --> 00:00:50.340 
order to to make it a little bit more
interesting<00:00:47.829> and<00:00:48.010> these<00:00:48.850> two<00:00:49.179> ways<00:00:49.449> can<00:00:50.170> be

00:00:50.340 --> 00:00:50.350 
interesting and these two ways can be

00:00:50.350 --> 00:00:51.810 
interesting and these two ways can be
used<00:00:50.679> in<00:00:50.890> a<00:00:50.980> lot<00:00:51.219> of<00:00:51.249> different<00:00:51.489> chord

00:00:51.810 --> 00:00:51.820 
used in a lot of different chord

00:00:51.820 --> 00:00:53.989 
used in a lot of different chord
progressions<00:00:52.300> so<00:00:52.510> go<00:00:52.929> and<00:00:53.019> play<00:00:53.170> a<00:00:53.199> D<00:00:53.440> chord

00:00:53.989 --> 00:00:53.999 
progressions so go and play a D chord

00:01:49.060 --> 00:01:51.760 

you've<00:01:50.060> created<00:01:50.330> some<00:01:50.600> interest<00:01:50.900> out<00:01:51.020> of<00:01:51.140> well

00:01:51.760 --> 00:01:51.770 
you've created some interest out of well

you've created some interest out of well
really<00:01:51.950> two<00:01:52.130> different<00:01:52.250> chords<00:01:52.640> but<00:01:52.820> out<00:01:53.090> of<00:01:53.299> a

00:01:53.350 --> 00:01:53.360 
really two different chords but out of a

00:01:53.360 --> 00:01:56.920 
really two different chords but out of a
D<00:01:53.509> chord<00:01:53.799> notice<00:01:54.799> I<00:01:55.070> can<00:01:55.880> I<00:01:56.240> can<00:01:56.450> approach<00:01:56.720> that

00:01:56.920 --> 00:01:56.930 
D chord notice I can I can approach that

00:01:56.930 --> 00:02:03.810 
D chord notice I can I can approach that
a<00:01:56.960> couple<00:01:57.259> different<00:01:57.530> ways<00:01:57.649> I<00:01:57.680> can<00:01:57.979> strum

00:02:03.810 --> 00:02:03.820 

00:02:03.820 --> 00:02:09.790 

or<00:02:04.330> I<00:02:04.390> can<00:02:04.810> strum

00:02:09.790 --> 00:02:09.800 

00:02:09.800 --> 00:02:13.120 

and<00:02:09.890> then<00:02:10.729> I<00:02:10.760> can<00:02:11.000> change<00:02:11.360> to<00:02:11.870> my<00:02:11.990> D<00:02:12.050> sus<00:02:12.440> after

00:02:13.120 --> 00:02:13.130 
and then I can change to my D sus after

00:02:13.130 --> 00:02:17.559 
and then I can change to my D sus after
I've<00:02:13.340> done<00:02:13.610> the<00:02:13.760> accented<00:02:14.300> strum<00:02:14.600> like<00:02:14.900> this

00:02:17.559 --> 00:02:17.569 

00:02:17.569 --> 00:02:19.839 

that's<00:02:18.290> by<00:02:18.439> using<00:02:18.500> a<00:02:18.860> very<00:02:19.189> simple<00:02:19.519> technique

00:02:19.839 --> 00:02:19.849 
that's by using a very simple technique

00:02:19.849 --> 00:02:23.009 
that's by using a very simple technique
called<00:02:20.120> a<00:02:20.390> hammer<00:02:20.750> on

00:02:23.009 --> 00:02:23.019 

00:02:23.019 --> 00:02:25.270 

and<00:02:24.019> it<00:02:24.140> just<00:02:24.379> adds<00:02:24.590> a<00:02:24.739> little<00:02:24.890> bit<00:02:25.129> more

00:02:25.270 --> 00:02:25.280 
and it just adds a little bit more

00:02:25.280 --> 00:02:28.089 
and it just adds a little bit more
interest<00:02:25.610> than<00:02:26.440> starting<00:02:27.440> there<00:02:27.620> you<00:02:27.799> start

00:02:28.089 --> 00:02:28.099 
interest than starting there you start

00:02:28.099 --> 00:02:31.800 
interest than starting there you start
with<00:02:28.280> me<00:02:28.400> and<00:02:28.870> then<00:02:29.870> finish<00:02:30.170> with<00:02:30.200> the<00:02:30.409> D<00:02:30.620> sus

00:02:31.800 --> 00:02:31.810 
with me and then finish with the D sus

00:02:31.810 --> 00:02:34.570 
with me and then finish with the D sus
the<00:02:32.810> other<00:02:32.959> fairly<00:02:33.530> simple<00:02:33.920> thing<00:02:34.129> you<00:02:34.159> can<00:02:34.400> do

00:02:34.570 --> 00:02:34.580 
the other fairly simple thing you can do

00:02:34.580 --> 00:02:38.470 
the other fairly simple thing you can do
with<00:02:34.790> this<00:02:34.940> chord<00:02:35.299> is<00:02:36.849> take<00:02:37.849> your<00:02:38.180> middle

00:02:38.470 --> 00:02:38.480 
with this chord is take your middle

00:02:38.480 --> 00:02:43.630 
with this chord is take your middle
finger<00:02:38.870> off<00:02:40.480> that<00:02:41.480> creates<00:02:41.900> what's<00:02:42.799> called<00:02:42.860> ad

anything<00:03:20.480> in<00:03:20.630> there<00:03:20.810> and<00:03:20.990> you'll<00:03:21.440> learn<00:03:21.560> a

anything in there and you'll learn a
little<00:03:21.890> bit<00:03:21.950> more<00:03:22.010> about<00:03:22.430> music<00:03:22.910> theory<00:03:23.510> and

00:03:24.160 --> 00:03:24.170 
little bit more about music theory and

00:03:24.170 --> 00:03:27.490 
little bit more about music theory and
how<00:03:24.590> to<00:03:24.650> apply<00:03:24.920> that<00:03:25.010> to<00:03:25.280> your<00:03:25.310> playing<00:03:26.500> well

00:03:27.490 --> 00:03:27.500 
how to apply that to your playing well

00:03:27.500 --> 00:03:32.309 
how to apply that to your playing well
we've<00:03:27.620> got<00:03:27.740> D<00:03:28.060> sus<00:03:29.060> to

00:03:32.309 --> 00:03:32.319 

00:03:32.319 --> 00:03:37.259 

and<00:03:32.470> do<00:03:33.099> you<00:03:33.250> this<00:03:33.689> DSS<00:03:34.689> for<00:03:34.900> and<00:03:35.519> so<00:03:36.519> strummin

00:03:37.259 --> 00:03:37.269 
and do you this DSS for and so strummin

00:03:37.269 --> 00:04:05.670 
and do you this DSS for and so strummin
are<00:03:37.360> very<00:03:37.480> simple<00:03:40.049> ad<00:03:41.049> the<00:03:41.170> d2

00:04:05.670 --> 00:04:05.680 

00:04:05.680 --> 00:04:07.440 

so<00:04:06.430> hopefully<00:04:06.700> this<00:04:06.819> was<00:04:06.970> helpful<00:04:07.000> in

00:04:07.440 --> 00:04:07.450 
so hopefully this was helpful in

00:04:07.450 --> 00:04:10.020 
so hopefully this was helpful in
expanding<00:04:08.110> the<00:04:08.470> way<00:04:08.650> you<00:04:08.709> play<00:04:09.220> a<00:04:09.489> D<00:04:09.819> chord

00:04:10.020 --> 00:04:10.030 
expanding the way you play a D chord

00:04:10.030 --> 00:04:13.709 
expanding the way you play a D chord
we'll<00:04:10.750> see<00:04:10.900> if<00:04:10.989> I'm<00:04:11.140> more<00:04:11.260> real<00:04:11.500> soon
