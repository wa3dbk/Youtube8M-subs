we've<00:00:14.490> got<00:00:14.670> CF<00:00:15.470> the<00:00:16.470> great<00:00:16.619> thing<00:00:16.740> about<00:00:16.770> this

00:00:17.000 --> 00:00:17.010 
we've got CF the great thing about this

00:00:17.010 --> 00:00:20.900 
we've got CF the great thing about this
to<00:00:17.220> me<00:00:17.279> is<00:00:18.500> where<00:00:19.500> you<00:00:19.650> buy<00:00:19.920> anything<00:00:20.609> to<00:00:20.760> give

00:00:20.900 --> 00:00:20.910 
to me is where you buy anything to give

00:00:20.910 --> 00:00:22.370 
to me is where you buy anything to give
a<00:00:20.939> chord<00:00:21.150> voicing<00:00:21.630> or<00:00:21.840> your<00:00:22.050> particular

00:00:22.370 --> 00:00:22.380 
a chord voicing or your particular

00:00:22.380 --> 00:00:24.769 
a chord voicing or your particular
alignment<00:00:22.890> might<00:00:23.369> be<00:00:23.490> revising<00:00:23.910> it's<00:00:24.630> the

00:00:24.769 --> 00:00:24.779 
alignment might be revising it's the

00:00:24.779 --> 00:00:26.210 
alignment might be revising it's the
same<00:00:25.050> in<00:00:25.260> every<00:00:25.350> opportunity<00:00:25.769> that<00:00:26.039> every

00:00:26.210 --> 00:00:26.220 
same in every opportunity that every

00:00:26.220 --> 00:00:27.980 
same in every opportunity that every
single<00:00:26.400> key<00:00:26.760> the<00:00:26.910> shape<00:00:27.180> is<00:00:27.390> exactly<00:00:27.480> the<00:00:27.840> same

00:00:27.980 --> 00:00:27.990 
single key the shape is exactly the same

00:00:27.990 --> 00:00:30.380 
single key the shape is exactly the same
so<00:00:28.529> that<00:00:28.650> part<00:00:28.859> is<00:00:29.010> always<00:00:29.160> the<00:00:29.340> same<00:00:29.490> so<00:00:30.300> for

00:00:30.380 --> 00:00:30.390 
so that part is always the same so for

00:00:30.390 --> 00:00:34.069 
so that part is always the same so for
example<00:00:30.840> if<00:00:31.679> I<00:00:31.830> was<00:00:31.890> to<00:00:32.040> take<00:00:32.189> a<00:00:32.460> C<00:00:33.390> major<00:00:33.630> 7<00:00:34.020> as

00:00:34.069 --> 00:00:34.079 
example if I was to take a C major 7 as

00:00:34.079 --> 00:00:36.860 
example if I was to take a C major 7 as
far<00:00:34.260> as<00:00:34.380> the<00:00:34.469> reason<00:00:35.000> so<00:00:36.000> C<00:00:36.270> major<00:00:36.450> 7<00:00:36.840> chord

00:00:36.860 --> 00:00:36.870 
far as the reason so C major 7 chord

00:00:36.870 --> 00:00:41.360 
far as the reason so C major 7 chord
which<00:00:37.380> was<00:00:39.410> supposed<00:00:40.410> to<00:00:40.469> astonishingly<00:00:41.070> have

00:00:41.360 --> 00:00:41.370 
which was supposed to astonishingly have

00:00:41.370 --> 00:00:45.080 
which was supposed to astonishingly have
this<00:00:41.489> scholarship<00:00:42.950> so<00:00:43.950> just<00:00:44.460> one<00:00:44.640> one<00:00:44.910> no

that's<00:00:59.050> everybody's<00:00:59.800> position

00:01:08.170 --> 00:01:08.180 

00:01:08.180 --> 00:01:10.930 

these<00:01:08.870> works<00:01:09.170> with<00:01:09.290> all<00:01:09.440> chord<00:01:09.860> shapes<00:01:10.130> if<00:01:10.820> I

00:01:10.930 --> 00:01:10.940 
these works with all chord shapes if I

00:01:10.940 --> 00:01:14.730 
these works with all chord shapes if I
take<00:01:11.150> this<00:01:11.270> voicing<00:01:11.720> today<00:01:11.930> -<00:01:12.200> OH

00:01:14.730 --> 00:01:14.740 

00:01:14.740 --> 00:01:18.660 

let's<00:01:15.610> sort<00:01:15.880> it

00:01:18.660 --> 00:01:18.670 

00:01:18.670 --> 00:01:21.539 

you're<00:01:19.240> supposed<00:01:19.450> to<00:01:19.539> play<00:01:19.750> right<00:01:19.990> here

00:01:21.539 --> 00:01:21.549 
you're supposed to play right here

00:01:21.549 --> 00:01:25.560 
you're supposed to play right here
exactly<00:01:22.299> so<00:01:23.130> so<00:01:24.130> this<00:01:24.250> follows<00:01:24.460> through<00:01:24.880> for<00:01:25.240> a

00:01:25.560 --> 00:01:25.570 
exactly so so this follows through for a

00:01:25.570 --> 00:01:28.349 
exactly so so this follows through for a

00:01:42.300 --> 00:01:42.310 

00:01:42.310 --> 00:01:46.810 

-<00:01:43.310> the<00:01:43.460> show<00:01:43.730> is<00:01:44.830> exactly<00:01:45.830> so<00:01:46.100> if<00:01:46.310> I<00:01:46.430> start<00:01:46.670> only

00:01:46.810 --> 00:01:46.820 
- the show is exactly so if I start only

00:01:46.820 --> 00:01:48.460 
- the show is exactly so if I start only
pastry<00:01:47.420> so<00:01:47.570> that<00:01:47.690> particular<00:01:47.960> shape<00:01:48.230> when<00:01:48.410> you

00:01:48.460 --> 00:01:48.470 
pastry so that particular shape when you

00:01:48.470 --> 00:02:00.790 
pastry so that particular shape when you
start<00:01:48.740> on<00:01:48.860> the<00:01:48.980> East<00:01:49.190> Room<00:01:49.370> on<00:01:49.580> the<00:01:49.670> reach<00:01:59.620> if<00:02:00.620> I

00:02:00.790 --> 00:02:00.800 
start on the East Room on the reach if I

00:02:00.800 --> 00:02:02.470 
start on the East Room on the reach if I
wish<00:02:00.920> to<00:02:01.040> start<00:02:01.190> up<00:02:01.370> the<00:02:01.460> a<00:02:01.490> story<00:02:01.910> shows<00:02:02.240> I

wish to start up the a story shows I

00:02:02.480 --> 00:02:13.000 
wish to start up the a story shows I
then<00:02:02.660> screw<00:02:11.050> so<00:02:12.050> I<00:02:12.080> have<00:02:12.230> to<00:02:12.350> compensate<00:02:12.620> for

00:02:13.000 --> 00:02:13.010 
then screw so I have to compensate for

00:02:13.010 --> 00:02:18.460 
then screw so I have to compensate for
my<00:02:13.130> children<00:02:13.520> basically<00:02:17.080> so<00:02:18.080> since<00:02:18.290> you're

00:02:18.460 --> 00:02:18.470 
my children basically so since you're

00:02:18.470 --> 00:02:20.410 
my children basically so since you're
optimist<00:02:18.770> I've<00:02:18.890> learned<00:02:19.100> one<00:02:19.400> arpeggio<00:02:20.180> show

00:02:20.410 --> 00:02:20.420 
optimist I've learned one arpeggio show

00:02:20.420 --> 00:02:23.050 
optimist I've learned one arpeggio show
I<00:02:20.660> can<00:02:21.080> utilize<00:02:21.230> it<00:02:21.740> adding<00:02:22.520> what<00:02:22.610> I<00:02:22.640> like<00:02:22.880> on

00:02:23.050 --> 00:02:23.060 
I can utilize it adding what I like on

00:02:23.060 --> 00:02:25.840 
I can utilize it adding what I like on
the<00:02:23.120> neck<00:02:23.590> if<00:02:24.590> I<00:02:24.740> choose<00:02:24.980> very<00:02:25.250> different<00:02:25.610> key

00:02:25.840 --> 00:02:25.850 
the neck if I choose very different key

00:02:25.850 --> 00:02:27.840 
the neck if I choose very different key
or<00:02:26.450> in<00:02:26.570> a<00:02:26.630> different<00:02:27.230> video

00:02:30.970 --> 00:02:30.980 
and my rap idea myself a different start

00:02:30.980 --> 00:02:32.590 
and my rap idea myself a different start
already<00:02:31.100> windows<00:02:31.670> it's<00:02:32.150> a<00:02:32.180> little<00:02:32.450> where<00:02:32.570> I

00:02:32.590 --> 00:02:32.600 
already windows it's a little where I

00:02:32.600 --> 00:02:34.390 
already windows it's a little where I
play<00:02:32.900> on<00:02:33.080> the<00:02:33.200> instrument<00:02:33.650> is<00:02:33.800> still<00:02:34.070> the<00:02:34.190> same

00:02:34.390 --> 00:02:34.400 
play on the instrument is still the same

00:02:34.400 --> 00:02:46.780 
play on the instrument is still the same
shape<00:02:34.760> so<00:02:35.000> if<00:02:35.060> I<00:02:35.180> play<00:02:35.390> G<00:02:35.630> my<00:02:35.840> 70s<00:02:36.590> here<00:02:45.790> still

00:02:46.780 --> 00:02:46.790 
shape so if I play G my 70s here still

00:02:46.790 --> 00:02:49.390 
shape so if I play G my 70s here still
exactly<00:02:47.090> essentially<00:02:47.860> this<00:02:48.860> is<00:02:49.040> a<00:02:49.070> really

useful tool for equalizer because your

00:02:51.020 --> 00:02:52.630 
useful tool for equalizer because your
