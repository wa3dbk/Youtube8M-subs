00:03:06.820 --> 00:03:06.830 

00:03:06.830 --> 00:03:14.120 

yeah<00:03:08.090> that<00:03:09.090> was<00:03:09.180> pretty<00:03:09.360> rough<00:03:09.950> and<00:03:10.950> I<00:03:13.130> guess

00:03:14.120 --> 00:03:14.130 
yeah that was pretty rough and I guess

00:03:14.130 --> 00:03:16.610 
yeah that was pretty rough and I guess
just<00:03:14.160> made<00:03:14.580> it<00:03:14.700> worse<00:03:14.910> so<00:03:15.299> I<00:03:15.840> decided<00:03:16.320> to<00:03:16.410> take

00:03:16.610 --> 00:03:16.620 
just made it worse so I decided to take

00:03:16.620 --> 00:03:30.020 
just made it worse so I decided to take
matters<00:03:16.799> into<00:03:17.190> my<00:03:17.310> own<00:03:17.459> hands

00:03:30.020 --> 00:03:30.030 

00:03:30.030 --> 00:03:32.190 

unfortunately<00:03:31.030> um<00:03:31.269> there<00:03:31.900> was<00:03:31.989> only<00:03:32.080> a

00:03:32.190 --> 00:03:32.200 
unfortunately um there was only a

00:03:32.200 --> 00:03:34.170 
unfortunately um there was only a
temporary<00:03:32.409> fix<00:03:32.980> and<00:03:33.370> it<00:03:33.580> didn't<00:03:33.819> really<00:03:33.970> solve

00:03:34.170 --> 00:03:34.180 
temporary fix and it didn't really solve

00:03:34.180 --> 00:03:37.259 
temporary fix and it didn't really solve
much<00:03:34.480> so<00:03:34.690> I<00:03:34.720> figured<00:03:35.140> I'd<00:03:35.409> just<00:03:35.830> apologize<00:03:36.700> you
