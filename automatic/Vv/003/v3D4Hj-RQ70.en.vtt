00:00:00.060 --> 00:00:02.270 

so<00:00:00.329> I<00:00:00.359> was<00:00:00.630> walking<00:00:01.020> in<00:00:01.170> the<00:00:01.199> lumbridge<00:00:01.709> and<00:00:02.040> I

00:00:02.270 --> 00:00:02.280 
so I was walking in the lumbridge and I

00:00:02.280 --> 00:00:04.220 
so I was walking in the lumbridge and I
saw<00:00:02.490> a<00:00:02.520> group<00:00:02.879> of<00:00:03.060> people<00:00:03.480> in<00:00:03.659> a<00:00:03.780> very<00:00:03.990> odd

00:00:04.220 --> 00:00:04.230 
saw a group of people in a very odd

00:00:04.230 --> 00:00:06.260 
saw a group of people in a very odd
location<00:00:04.920> so<00:00:05.190> I<00:00:05.220> thought<00:00:05.520> I<00:00:05.549> am<00:00:05.850> going<00:00:05.879> to

00:00:06.260 --> 00:00:06.270 
location so I thought I am going to

00:00:06.270 --> 00:00:08.450 
location so I thought I am going to
investigate<00:00:06.690> that<00:00:07.140> so<00:00:07.529> I<00:00:07.560> went<00:00:07.950> to<00:00:08.010> the<00:00:08.160> place

00:00:08.450 --> 00:00:08.460 
investigate that so I went to the place

00:00:08.460 --> 00:00:11.150 
investigate that so I went to the place
and<00:00:08.760> then<00:00:08.910> I<00:00:09.030> saw<00:00:09.240> like<00:00:09.269> 10<00:00:09.480> BOTS<00:00:10.440> I<00:00:10.740> assumed

00:00:11.150 --> 00:00:11.160 
and then I saw like 10 BOTS I assumed

00:00:11.160 --> 00:00:12.999 
and then I saw like 10 BOTS I assumed
they<00:00:11.309> were<00:00:11.460> BOTS<00:00:11.759> because<00:00:12.120> all<00:00:12.300> of<00:00:12.330> them<00:00:12.630> were

00:00:12.999 --> 00:00:13.009 
they were BOTS because all of them were

00:00:13.009 --> 00:00:15.829 
they were BOTS because all of them were
level<00:00:14.009> 3<00:00:14.280> and<00:00:14.519> most<00:00:14.790> of<00:00:14.940> them<00:00:15.089> had<00:00:15.299> similar

00:00:15.829 --> 00:00:15.839 
level 3 and most of them had similar

00:00:15.839 --> 00:00:17.930 
level 3 and most of them had similar
names<00:00:16.109> very<00:00:16.529> very<00:00:16.800> similar<00:00:17.070> names<00:00:17.520> just<00:00:17.789> the

00:00:17.930 --> 00:00:17.940 
names very very similar names just the

00:00:17.940 --> 00:00:19.790 
names very very similar names just the
numbers<00:00:18.390> at<00:00:18.630> the<00:00:18.660> end<00:00:18.900> were<00:00:19.080> different<00:00:19.590> so<00:00:19.770> I

00:00:19.790 --> 00:00:19.800 
numbers at the end were different so I

00:00:19.800 --> 00:00:21.800 
numbers at the end were different so I
thought<00:00:20.039> maybe<00:00:20.279> after<00:00:20.580> some<00:00:21.029> kind<00:00:21.210> of<00:00:21.390> update

00:00:21.800 --> 00:00:21.810 
thought maybe after some kind of update

00:00:21.810 --> 00:00:23.810 
thought maybe after some kind of update
on<00:00:21.990> the<00:00:22.109> runescape<00:00:22.410> they<00:00:23.039> got<00:00:23.250> stuck

00:00:23.810 --> 00:00:23.820 
on the runescape they got stuck

00:00:23.820 --> 00:00:26.269 
on the runescape they got stuck
the<00:00:23.939> bots<00:00:24.180> just<00:00:24.570> broke<00:00:24.930> and<00:00:25.199> then<00:00:25.859> I<00:00:25.949> saw<00:00:26.160> this

00:00:26.269 --> 00:00:26.279 
the bots just broke and then I saw this

00:00:26.279 --> 00:00:28.279 
the bots just broke and then I saw this
one<00:00:26.519> guy<00:00:26.550> typed<00:00:27.029> something<00:00:27.330> and<00:00:27.750> all<00:00:28.019> of<00:00:28.170> those

00:00:28.279 --> 00:00:28.289 
one guy typed something and all of those

00:00:28.289 --> 00:00:31.040 
one guy typed something and all of those
BOTS<00:00:28.680> repeated<00:00:29.340> what<00:00:29.519> he<00:00:29.730> said<00:00:30.000> so<00:00:30.750> he<00:00:30.900> was

00:00:31.040 --> 00:00:31.050 
BOTS repeated what he said so he was

00:00:31.050 --> 00:00:32.870 
BOTS repeated what he said so he was
like<00:00:31.260> the<00:00:31.410> leader<00:00:31.650> of<00:00:31.920> all<00:00:32.099> these<00:00:32.309> bots<00:00:32.610> and

00:00:32.870 --> 00:00:32.880 
like the leader of all these bots and

00:00:32.880 --> 00:00:35.000 
like the leader of all these bots and
whatever<00:00:33.300> he<00:00:33.690> would<00:00:33.840> say<00:00:34.110> all<00:00:34.350> these<00:00:34.710> bots

00:00:35.000 --> 00:00:35.010 
whatever he would say all these bots

00:00:42.350 --> 00:00:42.360 
because this is kind of bad because in

00:00:42.360 --> 00:00:44.119 
because this is kind of bad because in
this<00:00:42.570> case<00:00:42.840> okay<00:00:43.140> there<00:00:43.530> were<00:00:43.710> kind<00:00:43.950> of

00:00:44.119 --> 00:00:44.129 
this case okay there were kind of

00:00:44.129 --> 00:00:45.830 
this case okay there were kind of
breaking<00:00:44.550> rules<00:00:44.579> yes<00:00:45.149> they<00:00:45.329> was<00:00:45.480> spamming

00:00:45.830 --> 00:00:45.840 
breaking rules yes they was spamming

00:00:45.840 --> 00:00:48.200 
breaking rules yes they was spamming
there<00:00:46.559> may<00:00:46.739> be<00:00:46.770> a<00:00:46.920> case<00:00:47.100> where<00:00:47.210> individually

00:00:48.200 --> 00:00:48.210 
there may be a case where individually

00:00:48.210 --> 00:00:50.000 
there may be a case where individually
they're<00:00:48.480> doing<00:00:48.780> nothing<00:00:49.110> wrong<00:00:49.379> because<00:00:49.620> they

00:00:50.000 --> 00:00:50.010 
they're doing nothing wrong because they

00:00:50.010 --> 00:00:52.130 
they're doing nothing wrong because they
said<00:00:50.219> maybe<00:00:50.430> two<00:00:50.730> lines<00:00:51.000> of<00:00:51.210> text<00:00:51.449> maybe<00:00:51.750> three

00:00:52.130 --> 00:00:52.140 
said maybe two lines of text maybe three

00:00:52.140 --> 00:00:54.020 
said maybe two lines of text maybe three
lines<00:00:52.379> of<00:00:52.559> text<00:00:52.770> nothing<00:00:53.190> wrong<00:00:53.370> completely

00:00:54.020 --> 00:00:54.030 
lines of text nothing wrong completely

00:00:54.030 --> 00:00:55.790 
lines of text nothing wrong completely
so<00:00:54.480> you<00:00:54.510> can't<00:00:54.840> really<00:00:55.110> deport<00:00:55.649> them

00:00:55.790 --> 00:00:55.800 
so you can't really deport them

00:00:55.800 --> 00:00:58.279 
so you can't really deport them
individually<00:00:56.610> because<00:00:56.789> they're<00:00:57.270> just<00:00:57.690> saying

00:00:58.279 --> 00:00:58.289 
individually because they're just saying

00:00:58.289 --> 00:01:00.889 
individually because they're just saying
stuff<00:00:58.710> but<00:00:59.370> as<00:00:59.520> a<00:00:59.550> group<00:00:59.940> they<00:01:00.149> make<00:01:00.329> a<00:01:00.600> huge

00:01:00.889 --> 00:01:00.899 
stuff but as a group they make a huge

00:01:00.899 --> 00:01:02.959 
stuff but as a group they make a huge

and then spamming all this stuff so I
don't<00:01:23.369> know<00:01:23.549> this<00:01:23.729> is<00:01:23.880> something<00:01:24.180> that<00:01:24.210> I

00:01:24.350 --> 00:01:24.360 
don't know this is something that I

00:01:24.360 --> 00:01:26.179 
don't know this is something that I
never<00:01:24.600> seen<00:01:24.990> before<00:01:25.110> and<00:01:25.500> I<00:01:25.560> really<00:01:25.799> found

00:01:26.179 --> 00:01:26.189 
never seen before and I really found

00:01:26.189 --> 00:01:28.399 
never seen before and I really found
this<00:01:26.310> interesting<00:01:26.670> to<00:01:27.299> be<00:01:27.420> honest<00:01:27.750> and<00:01:27.900> he

00:01:28.399 --> 00:01:28.409 
this interesting to be honest and he

00:01:28.409 --> 00:01:30.319 
this interesting to be honest and he
said<00:01:28.650> that<00:01:28.799> this<00:01:28.890> is<00:01:29.070> a<00:01:29.100> private<00:01:29.400> script<00:01:30.000> so

00:01:30.319 --> 00:01:30.329 
said that this is a private script so

00:01:30.329 --> 00:01:32.749 
said that this is a private script so
this<00:01:31.200> is<00:01:31.409> not<00:01:31.590> available<00:01:32.100> for<00:01:32.369> download

00:01:32.749 --> 00:01:32.759 
this is not available for download

00:01:32.759 --> 00:01:34.730 
this is not available for download
anywhere<00:01:33.210> so<00:01:33.509> that's<00:01:33.720> a<00:01:33.840> good<00:01:33.990> thing<00:01:34.229> because

00:01:34.730 --> 00:01:34.740 
anywhere so that's a good thing because

00:01:34.740 --> 00:01:38.330 
anywhere so that's a good thing because
if<00:01:35.070> this<00:01:35.250> would<00:01:35.549> be<00:01:35.579> used<00:01:35.970> massively<00:01:36.900> I<00:01:37.340> guess

00:01:38.330 --> 00:01:38.340

00:01:38.340 --> 00:01:40.039 
if this would be used massively I guess
it<00:01:38.549> wouldn't<00:01:38.790> really<00:01:39.150> because<00:01:39.750> you<00:01:39.869> need

00:01:40.039 --> 00:01:40.049 
it wouldn't really because you need

00:01:40.049 --> 00:01:42.440 
it wouldn't really because you need
quite<00:01:40.259> a<00:01:40.290> lot<00:01:40.530> of<00:01:40.680> accounts<00:01:41.340> and<00:01:41.820> if<00:01:42.150> all<00:01:42.329> of

00:01:42.440 --> 00:01:42.450 
quite a lot of accounts and if all of

00:01:42.450 --> 00:01:44.450 
quite a lot of accounts and if all of
those<00:01:42.630> got<00:01:42.899> banned<00:01:43.170> that's<00:01:43.860> quite<00:01:44.189> a<00:01:44.220> lot<00:01:44.430> of

00:01:44.450 --> 00:01:44.460 
those got banned that's quite a lot of

00:01:44.460 --> 00:01:46.910 
those got banned that's quite a lot of
money<00:01:44.729> down<00:01:45.390> the<00:01:45.600> drain<00:01:45.630> just<00:01:46.110> for<00:01:46.320> the<00:01:46.470> you

00:01:46.910 --> 00:01:46.920 
money down the drain just for the you

00:01:46.920 --> 00:01:49.219 
money down the drain just for the you
know<00:01:46.979> for<00:01:47.100> spamming<00:01:48.000> some<00:01:48.329> stuff<00:01:48.600> so<00:01:48.869> I<00:01:48.899> don't

00:01:49.219 --> 00:01:49.229 
know for spamming some stuff so I don't

00:01:49.229 --> 00:01:50.990 
know for spamming some stuff so I don't
think<00:01:49.470> this<00:01:49.590> would<00:01:49.829> go<00:01:49.890> even<00:01:50.520> if<00:01:50.670> it<00:01:50.790> was

00:01:50.990 --> 00:01:51.000 
think this would go even if it was

00:01:51.000 --> 00:01:53.749 
think this would go even if it was
publicly<00:01:51.720> available<00:01:52.200> for<00:01:52.829> download<00:01:53.220> this

00:01:53.749 --> 00:01:53.759 
publicly available for download this

00:01:53.759 --> 00:01:56.030 
publicly available for download this
wouldn't<00:01:54.180> be<00:01:54.270> too<00:01:54.479> bad<00:01:54.509> but<00:01:54.899> yeah<00:01:55.829> definitely

00:01:56.030 --> 00:01:56.040 
wouldn't be too bad but yeah definitely

00:01:56.040 --> 00:01:59.330 
wouldn't be too bad but yeah definitely
some<00:01:56.640> way<00:01:56.820> itself<00:01:57.240> definitely<00:01:58.130> anyway<00:01:59.130> that's

00:01:59.330 --> 00:01:59.340 
some way itself definitely anyway that's

00:01:59.340 --> 00:02:00.980 
some way itself definitely anyway that's
all<00:01:59.490> for<00:01:59.520> this<00:01:59.759> video<00:01:59.969> kind<00:02:00.360> of<00:02:00.450> a<00:02:00.509> short<00:02:00.780> video
