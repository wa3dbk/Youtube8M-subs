what I'm saying I've got Batman floor in
my<00:02:15.840> shop<00:02:16.140> so<00:02:16.500> my<00:02:16.680> shop<00:02:16.950> is<00:02:17.160> pretty<00:02:17.400> crooked<00:02:17.640> and

00:02:18.190 --> 00:02:18.200 
my shop so my shop is pretty crooked and

00:02:18.200 --> 00:02:20.900 
my shop so my shop is pretty crooked and
sometimes<00:02:19.200> it<00:02:19.890> can<00:02:20.040> be<00:02:20.070> a<00:02:20.160> challenge<00:02:20.520> to<00:02:20.640> level

00:02:20.900 --> 00:02:20.910 
sometimes it can be a challenge to level

00:02:20.910 --> 00:02:22.490 
sometimes it can be a challenge to level
things<00:02:21.120> off<00:02:21.420> this<00:02:21.780> is<00:02:21.959> a<00:02:21.989> very<00:02:22.080> basic

00:02:22.490 --> 00:02:22.500 
things off this is a very basic

00:02:22.500 --> 00:02:25.420 
things off this is a very basic
bare-bones<00:02:23.310> unit<00:02:23.940> to<00:02:24.239> be<00:02:24.420> offer

00:02:25.420 --> 00:02:25.430 
bare-bones unit to be offer

00:02:25.430 --> 00:02:27.640 
bare-bones unit to be offer
at<00:02:25.579> this<00:02:25.760> price<00:02:26.060> so<00:02:26.390> the<00:02:26.540> heating<00:02:26.780> element<00:02:27.500> is

00:02:27.640 --> 00:02:27.650 
at this price so the heating element is

00:02:27.650 --> 00:02:29.619 
at this price so the heating element is
pretty<00:02:28.010> much<00:02:28.159> bare<00:02:28.549> and<00:02:28.849> it's<00:02:29.209> going<00:02:29.360> to<00:02:29.450> get

00:02:29.619 --> 00:02:29.629 
pretty much bare and it's going to get

00:02:29.629 --> 00:02:31.960 
pretty much bare and it's going to get
hot<00:02:29.870> so<00:02:30.560> we<00:02:30.709> have<00:02:30.890> this<00:02:31.069> little<00:02:31.280> knob<00:02:31.640> on<00:02:31.939> here

00:02:31.960 --> 00:02:31.970 
hot so we have this little knob on here

00:02:31.970 --> 00:02:34.569 
hot so we have this little knob on here
it's<00:02:32.360> a<00:02:32.420> heat<00:02:32.629> resistant<00:02:33.140> knob<00:02:33.319> but<00:02:34.040> that

00:02:34.569 --> 00:02:34.579 
it's a heat resistant knob but that

00:02:34.579 --> 00:02:36.640 
it's a heat resistant knob but that
probably<00:02:34.879> will<00:02:35.239> get<00:02:35.420> a<00:02:35.480> little<00:02:35.780> warm<00:02:36.019> too

00:02:36.640 --> 00:02:36.650 
probably will get a little warm too

00:02:36.650 --> 00:02:38.020 
probably will get a little warm too
so<00:02:36.829> you<00:02:36.950> just<00:02:37.129> want<00:02:37.370> to<00:02:37.400> be<00:02:37.519> careful<00:02:37.909> with<00:02:38.000> that

00:02:38.020 --> 00:02:38.030 
so you just want to be careful with that

00:02:38.030 --> 00:02:39.550 
so you just want to be careful with that
you<00:02:38.360> always<00:02:38.510> have<00:02:38.780> to<00:02:38.870> be<00:02:38.989> careful<00:02:39.409> when

00:02:39.550 --> 00:02:39.560 
you always have to be careful when

00:02:39.560 --> 00:02:42.429 
you always have to be careful when

handling a flash cure unit after it is
fully<00:02:42.890> hot<00:02:43.189> okay<00:02:44.030> so<00:02:44.090> this<00:02:44.810> is<00:02:44.989> just<00:02:45.140> a<00:02:45.290> little

00:02:45.429 --> 00:02:45.439 
fully hot okay so this is just a little

00:02:45.439 --> 00:02:47.589 
fully hot okay so this is just a little
knob<00:02:45.739> to<00:02:46.159> help<00:02:46.370> you<00:02:46.549> move<00:02:46.790> the<00:02:46.849> unit<00:02:47.420> when

00:03:15.109 --> 00:03:17.679 
yet reliable and heavy-duty construction
that<00:03:15.889> we<00:03:16.010> have<00:03:16.220> I<00:03:16.519> like<00:03:16.970> the<00:03:17.090> fact<00:03:17.329> that<00:03:17.510> the

00:03:17.679 --> 00:03:17.689 
that we have I like the fact that the

00:03:17.689 --> 00:03:20.050 
that we have I like the fact that the
electrical<00:03:18.170> box<00:03:18.379> is<00:03:18.620> right<00:03:18.829> up<00:03:18.980> here<00:03:19.280> easily

00:03:20.050 --> 00:03:20.060 
electrical box is right up here easily

00:03:20.060 --> 00:03:23.110 
electrical box is right up here easily
accessible<00:03:20.150> and<00:03:20.900> you<00:03:21.799> know<00:03:21.920> nice<00:03:22.159> bolts<00:03:22.700> good

00:03:23.110 --> 00:03:23.120 
accessible and you know nice bolts good

00:03:23.120 --> 00:03:25.270 
accessible and you know nice bolts good
washers<00:03:23.629> you<00:03:23.810> got<00:03:23.930> a<00:03:23.959> nice<00:03:24.379> weld<00:03:24.709> here<00:03:25.129> and

00:03:25.270 --> 00:03:25.280 
washers you got a nice weld here and

00:03:25.280 --> 00:03:27.250 
washers you got a nice weld here and
you'll<00:03:25.730> notice<00:03:25.909> all<00:03:26.209> all<00:03:26.540> the<00:03:26.780> parts<00:03:27.109> are

00:03:27.250 --> 00:03:27.260 
you'll notice all all the parts are

00:03:27.260 --> 00:03:29.920 
you'll notice all all the parts are
modular<00:03:27.829> so<00:03:28.189> everything<00:03:29.150> can<00:03:29.329> be<00:03:29.449> taken<00:03:29.840> apart

00:03:29.920 --> 00:03:29.930 
modular so everything can be taken apart

00:03:29.930 --> 00:03:32.309 
modular so everything can be taken apart
this<00:03:30.319> this<00:03:30.709> is<00:03:30.859> what's<00:03:31.069> setting<00:03:31.370> on<00:03:31.579> the<00:03:31.730> post

00:03:32.309 --> 00:03:32.319 
this this is what's setting on the post

00:03:32.319 --> 00:03:34.900 
this this is what's setting on the post
this<00:03:33.319> comes<00:03:33.650> off<00:03:33.829> here<00:03:34.160> you<00:03:34.190> can<00:03:34.519> take<00:03:34.730> this

00:03:34.900 --> 00:03:34.910 
this comes off here you can take this

00:03:34.910 --> 00:03:37.300 
this comes off here you can take this
part<00:03:35.209> off<00:03:35.329> here<00:03:35.720> you<00:03:36.290> know<00:03:36.379> everything<00:03:36.889> can

00:03:37.300 --> 00:03:37.310 
part off here you know everything can

00:03:37.310 --> 00:03:39.699 
part off here you know everything can
come<00:03:37.549> apart<00:03:37.669> be<00:03:38.090> replaced<00:03:38.510> fixed<00:03:39.260> or<00:03:39.379> repaired

00:03:39.699 --> 00:03:39.709 
come apart be replaced fixed or repaired

00:03:39.709 --> 00:03:41.680 
come apart be replaced fixed or repaired
so<00:03:40.400> that<00:03:40.549> you<00:03:40.639> can<00:03:40.819> use<00:03:41.000> this<00:03:41.209> thing<00:03:41.269> basically

00:03:41.680 --> 00:03:41.690 
so that you can use this thing basically

00:03:41.690 --> 00:03:42.879 
so that you can use this thing basically
for<00:03:42.260> a<00:03:42.319> lifetime

00:03:42.879 --> 00:03:42.889 
for a lifetime

00:03:42.889 --> 00:03:45.789 
for a lifetime
and<00:03:43.120> quite<00:03:44.120> honestly<00:03:44.150> as<00:03:45.079> long<00:03:45.260> as<00:03:45.379> it's<00:03:45.530> cared

00:03:45.789 --> 00:03:45.799 
and quite honestly as long as it's cared

00:03:45.799 --> 00:03:48.280 
and quite honestly as long as it's cared
for<00:03:46.010> properly<00:03:46.280> and<00:03:46.730> used<00:03:46.909> properly<00:03:47.389> it<00:03:47.930> most

00:03:48.280 --> 00:03:48.290 
for properly and used properly it most

00:03:48.290 --> 00:03:50.050 
for properly and used properly it most
likely<00:03:48.379> will<00:03:48.980> last<00:03:49.280> a<00:03:49.519> lifetime

00:03:50.050 --> 00:03:50.060 
likely will last a lifetime

00:03:50.060 --> 00:03:53.470 
likely will last a lifetime
without<00:03:50.629> any<00:03:50.959> problems<00:03:51.590> or<00:03:51.739> any<00:03:51.919> repairs<00:03:52.549> okay

00:03:53.470 --> 00:03:53.480 
without any problems or any repairs okay

00:03:53.480 --> 00:03:56.080 
without any problems or any repairs okay
so<00:03:53.590> it's<00:03:54.590> a<00:03:54.650> pretty<00:03:54.829> cool<00:03:55.069> unit<00:03:55.519> let's<00:03:55.819> take<00:03:56.060> a

00:03:56.080 --> 00:03:56.090 
so it's a pretty cool unit let's take a

00:03:56.090 --> 00:03:58.449 
so it's a pretty cool unit let's take a
look<00:03:56.419> at<00:03:56.599> the<00:03:56.690> stand<00:03:56.989> of<00:03:57.290> course<00:03:57.650> we<00:03:57.859> have<00:03:58.099> the

00:03:58.449 --> 00:03:58.459 
look at the stand of course we have the

00:03:58.459 --> 00:04:01.629 
look at the stand of course we have the
extension<00:03:59.239> on<00:03:59.389> the<00:03:59.959> pole<00:04:00.169> stand<00:04:00.979> so<00:04:01.340> that<00:04:01.370> you

00:04:01.629 --> 00:04:01.639 
extension on the pole stand so that you
