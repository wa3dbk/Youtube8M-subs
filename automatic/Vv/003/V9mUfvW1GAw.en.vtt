00:00:45.960 --> 00:00:47.660 
it came with a remote control and these
are<00:00:46.170> kind<00:00:46.379> of<00:00:46.469> tough<00:00:46.710> to<00:00:46.860> find<00:00:47.100> because<00:00:47.280> the

00:00:47.660 --> 00:00:47.670 
are kind of tough to find because the

00:00:47.670 --> 00:00:50.959 
are kind of tough to find because the
end<00:00:47.879> piece<00:00:48.239> that<00:00:48.510> inserts<00:00:48.930> into<00:00:49.260> the<00:00:49.969> howitzer

00:00:50.959 --> 00:00:50.969 
end piece that inserts into the howitzer

00:00:50.969 --> 00:00:54.830 
end piece that inserts into the howitzer
is<00:00:51.629> usually<00:00:52.170> broken<00:00:52.469> in<00:00:52.920> this<00:00:53.309> one<00:00:53.850> is<00:00:54.180> not<00:00:54.510> and

00:00:54.830 --> 00:00:54.840 
is usually broken in this one is not and

00:00:54.840 --> 00:00:57.979 
is usually broken in this one is not and
that's<00:00:55.020> really<00:00:55.379> rare<00:00:56.000> there's<00:00:57.000> two<00:00:57.329> tabs<00:00:57.660> on

00:00:57.979 --> 00:00:57.989 
that's really rare there's two tabs on

00:00:57.989 --> 00:01:00.770 
that's really rare there's two tabs on
the<00:00:58.050> end<00:00:58.260> that<00:00:58.379> screw<00:00:58.859> into<00:00:59.129> the<00:00:59.879> howitzer<00:01:00.510> and

00:01:00.770 --> 00:01:00.780 
the end that screw into the howitzer and

00:01:00.780 --> 00:01:03.229 
the end that screw into the howitzer and
like<00:01:01.230> I<00:01:01.350> said<00:01:01.410> they're<00:01:01.739> usually<00:01:02.160> broken<00:01:02.370> now

00:01:03.229 --> 00:01:03.239 
like I said they're usually broken now

00:01:03.239 --> 00:01:05.600 
like I said they're usually broken now
you<00:01:03.750> do<00:01:03.960> not<00:01:04.110> need<00:01:04.379> this<00:01:04.619> to<00:01:04.830> operate<00:01:05.250> the<00:01:05.400> toy

00:01:05.600 --> 00:01:05.610 
you do not need this to operate the toy

00:01:05.610 --> 00:01:07.730 
you do not need this to operate the toy
I<00:01:05.880> find<00:01:06.390> that<00:01:06.570> it's<00:01:06.780> quite<00:01:06.990> a<00:01:07.020> hassle<00:01:07.260> to<00:01:07.619> use

00:01:07.730 --> 00:01:07.740 
I find that it's quite a hassle to use

00:01:07.740 --> 00:01:10.039 
I find that it's quite a hassle to use
the<00:01:07.890> remote<00:01:08.189> control<00:01:08.390> because<00:01:09.390> of<00:01:09.570> the<00:01:09.659> cable

00:01:10.039 --> 00:01:10.049 
the remote control because of the cable

00:01:10.049 --> 00:01:12.800 
the remote control because of the cable
so<00:01:10.860> you<00:01:10.920> can't<00:01:11.460> fire<00:01:11.700> the<00:01:12.030> toy<00:01:12.210> manually

00:01:12.800 --> 00:01:12.810 
so you can't fire the toy manually

00:01:12.810 --> 00:01:18.859 
so you can't fire the toy manually
without<00:01:13.229> the<00:01:13.380> remote<00:01:13.560> I<00:01:17.210> can<00:01:18.210> say<00:01:18.450> this<00:01:18.600> is<00:01:18.750> an

00:01:18.859 --> 00:01:18.869 
without the remote I can say this is an

00:01:18.869 --> 00:01:20.630 
without the remote I can say this is an
unusual<00:01:19.350> toy<00:01:19.530> because<00:01:19.830> I'm<00:01:19.950> sure<00:01:20.130> many<00:01:20.369> of<00:01:20.549> you

slide<00:02:19.410> this<00:02:19.650> in<00:02:19.890> here<00:02:27.110> in<00:02:28.110> a<00:02:28.200> while<00:02:28.350> since<00:02:28.590> I

00:02:28.730 --> 00:02:28.740 
slide this in here in a while since I

00:02:28.740 --> 00:02:33.860 
slide this in here in a while since I
did<00:02:28.770> this<00:02:30.410> there<00:02:31.410> we<00:02:31.530> go<00:02:31.709> lock<00:02:32.280> it<00:02:32.430> in<00:02:32.840> like<00:02:33.840> I

00:02:33.860 --> 00:02:33.870 
did this there we go lock it in like I

00:02:33.870 --> 00:02:35.900 
did this there we go lock it in like I
said<00:02:34.200> it's<00:02:34.740> been<00:02:34.890> a<00:02:34.920> while<00:02:35.130> since<00:02:35.370> I<00:02:35.550> operated

00:02:35.900 --> 00:02:35.910 
said it's been a while since I operated

00:02:35.910 --> 00:02:39.080 
said it's been a while since I operated
you<00:02:36.150> lock<00:02:36.390> it<00:02:36.570> in<00:02:36.750> and<00:02:36.990> now<00:02:37.440> it<00:02:38.430> is<00:02:38.610> ready<00:02:38.820> to

00:02:39.080 --> 00:02:39.090 
you lock it in and now it is ready to

00:02:39.090 --> 00:02:42.920 
you lock it in and now it is ready to
fire<00:02:40.010> so<00:02:41.010> what<00:02:41.220> we're<00:02:41.340> going<00:02:41.459> to<00:02:41.550> do<00:02:41.760> is<00:02:42.150> I'm

00:02:42.920 --> 00:02:42.930 
fire so what we're going to do is I'm

00:02:42.930 --> 00:02:45.170 
fire so what we're going to do is I'm
going<00:02:43.140> to<00:02:43.230> shoot<00:02:43.440> another<00:02:43.770> video<00:02:44.030> showing<00:02:45.030> you

00:02:45.170 --> 00:02:45.180 
going to shoot another video showing you

00:02:45.180 --> 00:02:48.140 
going to shoot another video showing you
how<00:02:45.630> this<00:02:46.470> operates<00:02:47.130> and<00:02:47.489> how<00:02:47.519> it<00:02:47.880> fires

00:02:48.140 --> 00:02:48.150 
how this operates and how it fires

00:02:48.150 --> 00:02:50.060 
how this operates and how it fires
because<00:02:48.510> I<00:02:48.600> have<00:02:48.720> to<00:02:48.870> set<00:02:49.080> up<00:02:49.110> some<00:02:49.410> objects<00:02:49.860> to

00:02:50.060 --> 00:02:50.070 
because I have to set up some objects to

00:02:50.070 --> 00:02:52.160 
because I have to set up some objects to
fire<00:02:50.310> a<00:02:50.340> bomb<00:02:50.700> and<00:02:51.420> you<00:02:51.540> can<00:02:51.720> see<00:02:51.930> it's<00:02:52.080> a
