00:00:07.210 --> 00:00:11.600
 last decades representatives 

00:00:09.890 --> 00:00:14.690
 official authorities 

00:00:11.600 --> 00:00:18.280
 united states of america steel 

00:00:14.690 --> 00:00:22.900
 pattern of incompetence stupidity 

00:00:18.280 --> 00:00:25.359
 cruelty and aggressiveness of the usa are 

00:00:22.900 --> 00:00:28.460
 instigators are not a warrior around the world 

00:00:25.359 --> 00:00:31.490
 present due to united states 

00:00:28.460 --> 00:00:34.550
 America , the threat of a real 

00:00:31.490 --> 00:00:35.410
 use of nuclear weapons in the near 

00:00:34.550 --> 00:00:38.230
 east 

00:00:35.410 --> 00:00:41.660
 Meanwhile , US President Barrack Obama 

00:00:38.230 --> 00:00:42.430
 openly calls Russia nuclear by the way 

00:00:41.660 --> 00:00:46.100
 power 

00:00:42.430 --> 00:00:49.910
 the enemy and the main threat to the united 

00:00:46.100 --> 00:00:52.070
 US state of America backed by 

00:00:49.910 --> 00:00:54.800
 its population fools 

00:00:52.070 --> 00:00:58.360
 propaganda spin the flywheel 

00:00:54.800 --> 00:01:00.920
 cold war we think that the us 

00:00:58.360 --> 00:01:04.330
 poses a threat to everything 

00:01:00.920 --> 00:01:07.700
 civilized world to all mankind 

00:01:04.330 --> 00:01:10.910
 this country is rapidly deteriorating and 

00:01:07.700 --> 00:01:12.190
 can no longer control their nuclear 

00:01:10.910 --> 00:01:14.690
 armament 

00:01:12.190 --> 00:01:17.810
 united states of america only 

00:01:14.690 --> 00:01:21.470
 country in the world really applied 

00:01:17.810 --> 00:01:24.920
 nuclear weapons in hiroshima and nagasaki and 

00:01:21.470 --> 00:01:26.890
 the united states have no moral rights to 

00:01:24.920 --> 00:01:30.290
 possession of nuclear weapons 

00:01:26.890 --> 00:01:31.340
 the us power is desperately clinging to 

00:01:30.290 --> 00:01:34.670
 elusive 

00:01:31.340 --> 00:01:38.720
 from their hands power is capable of real 

00:01:34.670 --> 00:01:42.470
 able to immerse the whole world from nuclear 

00:01:38.720 --> 00:01:45.380
 wars we think that representatives 

00:01:42.470 --> 00:01:46.760
 Russia on all official and 

00:01:45.380 --> 00:01:49.640
 informal 

00:01:46.760 --> 00:01:53.120
 levels need to be raised and 

00:01:49.640 --> 00:01:55.960
 lobby for deprivation of the right 

00:01:53.120 --> 00:01:59.390
 on nuclear weapons need to push 

00:01:55.960 --> 00:02:02.600
 dismantling this weapon followed 

00:01:59.390 --> 00:02:06.229
 transfer it under the control of civilized 

00:02:02.600 --> 00:02:09.409
 reasonable countries of course I personally do not 

00:02:06.229 --> 00:02:12.860
 so naive to think that the United States 

00:02:09.409 --> 00:02:15.340
 gladly agree to this 

00:02:12.860 --> 00:02:18.050
 to dismantle their nuclear weapons 

00:02:15.340 --> 00:02:20.930
 but all the world 

00:02:18.050 --> 00:02:24.020
 community for granted 

00:02:20.930 --> 00:02:26.630
 Considers the fact that the United States has a nuclear 

00:02:24.020 --> 00:02:30.110
 weapons must at least begin 

00:02:26.630 --> 00:02:32.990
 create that information environment in 

00:02:30.110 --> 00:02:36.050
 which is representative of usa constantly 

00:02:32.990 --> 00:02:38.300
 will say that they are not entitled to 

00:02:36.050 --> 00:02:41.150
 possession of nuclear weapons and need more 

00:02:38.300 --> 00:02:43.700
 disarm security purposes of everything 

00:02:41.150 --> 00:02:46.730
 of humanity and in this regard we created 

00:02:43.700 --> 00:02:48.230
 a petition to be sent to 

00:02:46.730 --> 00:02:50.240
 foreign ministry and in 

00:02:48.230 --> 00:02:53.020
 Administration of the President of Russia in 

00:02:50.240 --> 00:02:54.200
 which we require from our official 

00:02:53.020 --> 00:02:57.740
 representatives 

00:02:54.200 --> 00:03:01.940
 on the world on the world stage raise 

00:02:57.740 --> 00:03:04.910
 voice the question of depriving us of the right to 

00:03:01.940 --> 00:03:07.610
 nuclear weapons once again 

00:03:04.910 --> 00:03:11.300
 I personally am not so naive as to think 

00:03:07.610 --> 00:03:12.860
 that the United States will be happy to repair 

00:03:11.300 --> 00:03:16.700
 its nuclear weapons and will not 

00:03:12.860 --> 00:03:19.640
 cling to it to the end but create 

00:03:16.700 --> 00:03:22.520
 information background create lift 

00:03:19.640 --> 00:03:25.130
 this question needs to start 

00:03:22.520 --> 00:03:28.130
 at least small and recent in the us 

00:03:25.130 --> 00:03:30.830
 so long ago one joker organized a collection 

00:03:28.130 --> 00:03:35.209
 signatures for applying preventive 

00:03:30.830 --> 00:03:36.550
 nuclear strike on russia most 

00:03:35.209 --> 00:03:39.530
 of americans 

00:03:36.550 --> 00:03:41.720
 signed without thinking link to 

00:03:39.530 --> 00:03:43.850
 You will find the petition in the video description. 

00:03:41.720 --> 00:03:44.890
 spend two minutes of your precious 

00:03:43.850 --> 00:03:46.989
 of time 

00:03:44.890 --> 00:03:52.660
 participate in the information war 

00:03:46.989 --> 00:03:52.660
 against evil threatening the whole world
