00:00:41.030 --> 00:00:41.040 
well so for the C major chord that we

00:00:41.040 --> 00:00:43.850 
well so for the C major chord that we
learned<00:00:41.280> in<00:00:41.489> the<00:00:41.610> previous<00:00:41.820> episode<00:00:42.680> we<00:00:43.680> had

00:00:43.850 --> 00:00:43.860 
learned in the previous episode we had

00:00:43.860 --> 00:00:45.260 
learned in the previous episode we had
this<00:00:43.950> little<00:00:44.160> pattern<00:00:44.520> this<00:00:44.730> little<00:00:45.030> trick

00:00:45.260 --> 00:00:45.270 
this little pattern this little trick

00:00:45.270 --> 00:00:47.389 
this little pattern this little trick
remember<00:00:45.690> of<00:00:45.780> having<00:00:46.050> one<00:00:46.289> two<00:00:46.649> and<00:00:46.860> three

00:00:47.389 --> 00:00:47.399 
remember of having one two and three

00:00:47.399 --> 00:00:49.610 
remember of having one two and three
notes<00:00:48.210> in<00:00:48.390> between<00:00:48.420> the<00:00:48.719> first<00:00:48.930> two<00:00:49.170> notes<00:00:49.350> and

00:00:49.610 --> 00:00:49.620 
notes in between the first two notes and

00:00:49.620 --> 00:00:52.490 
notes in between the first two notes and
two<00:00:50.489> notes<00:00:50.789> between<00:00:51.270> the<00:00:51.600> second<00:00:52.050> two<00:00:52.260> notes

00:00:52.490 --> 00:00:52.500 
two notes between the second two notes

00:00:52.500 --> 00:00:55.220 
two notes between the second two notes
these<00:00:53.190> three<00:00:53.789> and<00:00:54.030> these<00:00:54.149> two<00:00:54.480> notes<00:00:54.750> are<00:00:55.050> the

00:00:55.220 --> 00:00:55.230 
these three and these two notes are the

00:00:55.230 --> 00:00:56.750 
these three and these two notes are the
notes<00:00:55.260> that<00:00:55.500> we<00:00:55.680> do<00:00:55.860> not<00:00:55.980> play<00:00:56.280> when<00:00:56.460> playing

00:00:56.750 --> 00:00:56.760 
notes that we do not play when playing

00:00:56.760 --> 00:01:00.139 
notes that we do not play when playing
the<00:00:56.910> chord<00:00:58.070> so<00:00:59.070> that's<00:00:59.460> the<00:00:59.609> pattern<00:00:59.789> for

00:01:00.139 --> 00:01:00.149 
the chord so that's the pattern for

00:01:00.149 --> 00:01:02.420 
the chord so that's the pattern for
major<00:01:00.449> now<00:01:01.109> for<00:01:01.410> minor<00:01:01.649> you're<00:01:01.920> also<00:01:02.100> going<00:01:02.370> to

00:01:02.420 --> 00:01:02.430 
major now for minor you're also going to

00:01:02.430 --> 00:01:04.460 
major now for minor you're also going to
have<00:01:02.550> a<00:01:02.579> little<00:01:02.730> pattern<00:01:03.120> but<00:01:03.719> this<00:01:04.170> time

00:01:04.460 --> 00:01:04.470 
have a little pattern but this time

00:01:04.470 --> 00:01:05.929 
have a little pattern but this time
we're<00:01:04.710> going<00:01:04.830> to<00:01:04.920> have<00:01:05.070> two<00:01:05.430> nodes<00:01:05.670> in<00:01:05.880> between

00:01:05.929 --> 00:01:05.939 
we're going to have two nodes in between

00:01:05.939 --> 00:01:08.990 
we're going to have two nodes in between
and<00:01:06.510> then<00:01:07.290> three<00:01:08.130> notes<00:01:08.400> so<00:01:08.640> it's<00:01:08.760> going<00:01:08.939> to

00:01:08.990 --> 00:01:09.000 
and then three notes so it's going to

00:01:09.000 --> 00:01:12.649 
and then three notes so it's going to
sound<00:01:09.150> like<00:01:09.270> this<00:01:10.520> okay<00:01:11.520> you<00:01:12.030> can<00:01:12.240> hear<00:01:12.390> that

00:01:12.649 --> 00:01:12.659 
sound like this okay you can hear that

00:01:12.659 --> 00:01:14.929 
sound like this okay you can hear that
really<00:01:12.960> sounds<00:01:13.290> different<00:01:13.740> than<00:01:14.520> a<00:01:14.700> major

00:01:14.929 --> 00:01:14.939 
really sounds different than a major

00:01:14.939 --> 00:01:17.510 
really sounds different than a major
chord<00:01:15.299> right<00:01:15.509> and<00:01:15.950> as<00:01:16.950> you<00:01:17.070> can<00:01:17.189> see<00:01:17.369> right

00:01:17.510 --> 00:01:17.520 
chord right and as you can see right

00:01:17.520 --> 00:01:19.219 
chord right and as you can see right
here<00:01:17.580> we've<00:01:17.880> got<00:01:17.909> two<00:01:18.270> notes<00:01:18.509> in<00:01:18.659> between<00:01:19.020> and

00:01:19.219 --> 00:01:19.229 
here we've got two notes in between and

00:01:19.229 --> 00:01:21.469 
here we've got two notes in between and
then<00:01:19.380> three<00:01:19.920> so<00:01:20.520> that's<00:01:20.850> a<00:01:20.970> pattern<00:01:21.180> for<00:01:21.450> all

00:01:21.469 --> 00:01:21.479 
then three so that's a pattern for all

00:01:21.479 --> 00:01:23.240 
then three so that's a pattern for all
the<00:01:21.600> minor<00:01:21.900> chords<00:01:22.380> let's<00:01:22.590> take<00:01:22.860> a<00:01:22.890> look<00:01:23.159> at

00:01:23.240 --> 00:01:23.250
