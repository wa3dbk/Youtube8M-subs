attachment guide today we're taking a

00:00:06.750 --> 00:00:08.270 
attachment guide today we're taking a
look<00:00:06.779> at<00:00:06.960> part<00:00:06.990> one<00:00:07.410> for<00:00:07.620> my<00:00:07.740> silence<00:00:08.010> or

look at part one for my silence or
attachments<00:00:08.820> guy<00:00:08.910> at<00:00:09.120> the<00:00:09.240> reason<00:00:09.480> for<00:00:09.630> this

00:00:09.709 --> 00:00:09.719 
attachments guy at the reason for this

00:00:09.719 --> 00:00:11.629 
attachments guy at the reason for this
being<00:00:09.929> is<00:00:10.410> because<00:00:10.559> today<00:00:10.980> I<00:00:11.010> tested<00:00:11.580> out

00:00:11.629 --> 00:00:11.639 
being is because today I tested out

00:00:11.639 --> 00:00:13.160 
being is because today I tested out
where<00:00:11.880> these<00:00:12.030> silence<00:00:12.480> or<00:00:12.570> reduces<00:00:12.990> recoil

00:00:13.160 --> 00:00:13.170 
where these silence or reduces recoil

00:00:13.170 --> 00:00:15.230 
where these silence or reduces recoil
and<00:00:13.590> sometime<00:00:14.280> soon<00:00:14.519> this<00:00:14.730> week<00:00:14.969> I'll<00:00:15.179> be

00:00:15.230 --> 00:00:15.240 
and sometime soon this week I'll be

00:00:15.240 --> 00:00:17.090 
and sometime soon this week I'll be
testing<00:00:15.509> out<00:00:15.719> where<00:00:15.900> these<00:00:16.080> silencer<00:00:16.590> reduces

00:00:17.090 --> 00:00:17.100 
testing out where these silencer reduces

00:00:17.100 --> 00:00:18.800 
testing out where these silencer reduces
damage<00:00:17.279> and<00:00:17.880> after<00:00:18.090> that<00:00:18.180> I'm<00:00:18.359> going<00:00:18.539> to<00:00:18.630> be

00:00:18.800 --> 00:00:18.810 
damage and after that I'm going to be

00:00:18.810 --> 00:00:20.300 
damage and after that I'm going to be
giving<00:00:18.930> you<00:00:19.170> my<00:00:19.350> overall<00:00:19.740> opinion<00:00:19.859> only

00:00:20.300 --> 00:00:20.310 
giving you my overall opinion only

00:00:20.310 --> 00:00:22.519 
giving you my overall opinion only
silencer<00:00:20.970> on<00:00:21.119> which<00:00:21.539> weapon<00:00:21.840> classes<00:00:22.080> it<00:00:22.410> is

00:00:22.519 --> 00:00:22.529 
silencer on which weapon classes it is

00:00:22.529 --> 00:00:25.099 
silencer on which weapon classes it is
good<00:00:22.800> etc<00:00:23.550> but<00:00:23.880> I<00:00:23.939> mean<00:00:24.150> like<00:00:24.390> I<00:00:24.570> said<00:00:24.810> today

00:00:25.099 --> 00:00:25.109 
good etc but I mean like I said today

00:00:25.109 --> 00:00:26.330 
good etc but I mean like I said today
we'll<00:00:25.289> be<00:00:25.320> taking<00:00:25.560> a<00:00:25.740> look<00:00:25.830> at<00:00:25.949> whether<00:00:26.220> these

00:00:26.330 --> 00:00:26.340 
we'll be taking a look at whether these

00:00:26.340 --> 00:00:28.099 
we'll be taking a look at whether these
silence<00:00:26.789> will<00:00:26.910> reduce<00:00:27.150> this<00:00:27.300> Rico<00:00:27.720> because

00:00:28.099 --> 00:00:28.109 
silence will reduce this Rico because

00:00:28.109 --> 00:00:29.689 
silence will reduce this Rico because
over<00:00:28.439> the<00:00:28.529> past<00:00:28.590> few<00:00:28.949> weeks<00:00:29.189> a<00:00:29.340> lot<00:00:29.490> of<00:00:29.550> people

00:00:29.689 --> 00:00:29.699 
over the past few weeks a lot of people

00:00:29.699 --> 00:00:31.070 
over the past few weeks a lot of people
have<00:00:29.939> been<00:00:29.970> saying<00:00:30.300> that<00:00:30.510> these<00:00:30.630> silencer

00:00:31.070 --> 00:00:31.080 
have been saying that these silencer

00:00:31.080 --> 00:00:33.560 
have been saying that these silencer
either<00:00:31.320> does<00:00:31.650> or<00:00:31.859> doesn't<00:00:32.369> reduce<00:00:32.610> recoil<00:00:33.000> so

00:00:33.560 --> 00:00:33.570 
either does or doesn't reduce recoil so

00:00:33.570 --> 00:00:35.120 
either does or doesn't reduce recoil so
today<00:00:33.840> I<00:00:33.870> went<00:00:34.140> into<00:00:34.380> a<00:00:34.410> private<00:00:34.860> match<00:00:34.980> I

00:00:35.120 --> 00:00:35.130

today I went into a private match I
tested<00:00:35.520> several<00:00:35.760> weapons<00:00:36.030> out<00:00:36.360> I'm<00:00:36.570> going<00:00:36.809> to

like<00:01:01.920> I<00:01:02.039> said<00:01:02.219> I<00:01:02.250> went<00:01:02.550> into<00:01:02.730> a<00:01:02.760> private<00:01:03.059> match

00:01:03.290 --> 00:01:03.300 
like I said I went into a private match

00:01:03.300 --> 00:01:05.299 
like I said I went into a private match
I<00:01:03.480> tested<00:01:03.870> out<00:01:03.930> those<00:01:04.170> guns<00:01:04.379> after<00:01:05.070> that<00:01:05.159> I

00:01:05.299 --> 00:01:05.309 
I tested out those guns after that I

00:01:05.309 --> 00:01:06.620 
I tested out those guns after that I
took<00:01:05.369> a<00:01:05.519> screenshot<00:01:05.880> from<00:01:06.180> the<00:01:06.330> actual

00:01:06.620 --> 00:01:06.630 
took a screenshot from the actual

00:01:06.630 --> 00:01:09.050 
took a screenshot from the actual
recording<00:01:07.229> on<00:01:07.350> my<00:01:07.470> computer<00:01:08.040> open<00:01:08.670> those<00:01:08.790> in

00:01:09.050 --> 00:01:09.060 
recording on my computer open those in

00:01:09.060 --> 00:01:10.760 
recording on my computer open those in
Photoshop<00:01:09.659> and<00:01:09.810> then<00:01:09.960> kind<00:01:10.200> of<00:01:10.260> create<00:01:10.560> like<00:01:10.740> a

00:01:10.760 --> 00:01:10.770 
Photoshop and then kind of create like a

00:01:10.770 --> 00:01:12.649 
Photoshop and then kind of create like a
side-by-side<00:01:11.130> comparison<00:01:11.549> to<00:01:12.510> make

00:01:12.649 --> 00:01:12.659 
side-by-side comparison to make

00:01:12.659 --> 00:01:14.780 
side-by-side comparison to make
everything<00:01:12.930> easier<00:01:13.470> to<00:01:13.770> see<00:01:14.100> so<00:01:14.549> the<00:01:14.670> first

00:01:14.780 --> 00:01:14.790 
everything easier to see so the first

00:01:14.790 --> 00:01:17.030 
everything easier to see so the first
gun<00:01:15.060> that<00:01:15.240> I<00:01:15.270> tested<00:01:15.750> was<00:01:15.900> the<00:01:16.049> MSMC<00:01:16.619> and<00:01:16.979> as

00:01:17.030 --> 00:01:17.040 
gun that I tested was the MSMC and as

00:01:17.040 --> 00:01:18.620 
gun that I tested was the MSMC and as
you<00:01:17.130> can<00:01:17.250> see<00:01:17.280> on<00:01:17.520> the<00:01:17.580> screen<00:01:17.670> right<00:01:17.970> now<00:01:18.030> the

00:01:18.620 --> 00:01:18.630 
you can see on the screen right now the

00:01:18.630 --> 00:01:20.539 
you can see on the screen right now the
left<00:01:18.869> side<00:01:19.080> being<00:01:19.320> without<00:01:19.530> the<00:01:19.740> silencer<00:01:20.400> and

00:01:20.539 --> 00:01:20.549 
left side being without the silencer and

00:01:20.549 --> 00:01:22.429 
left side being without the silencer and
the<00:01:20.909> right<00:01:21.119> side<00:01:21.299> being<00:01:21.570> with<00:01:21.780> the<00:01:21.900> silencer

00:01:22.429 --> 00:01:22.439 
the right side being with the silencer

00:01:22.439 --> 00:01:24.109 
the right side being with the silencer
you<00:01:22.770> can<00:01:22.979> immediately<00:01:23.220> tell<00:01:23.700> that<00:01:23.759> the

00:01:24.109 --> 00:01:24.119 
you can immediately tell that the

00:01:24.119 --> 00:01:26.090 
you can immediately tell that the
silencer<00:01:24.659> didn't<00:01:25.049> do<00:01:25.110> anything<00:01:25.409> to<00:01:25.799> reduce

00:01:26.090 --> 00:01:26.100 
silencer didn't do anything to reduce

00:01:26.100 --> 00:01:28.280 
silencer didn't do anything to reduce
the<00:01:26.250> ricoh<00:01:26.610> whatsoever<00:01:27.450> and<00:01:27.659> I<00:01:27.780> also<00:01:27.960> test

00:01:28.280 --> 00:01:28.290 
the ricoh whatsoever and I also test

just<00:01:31.200> to<00:01:31.290> make<00:01:31.439> sure<00:01:31.470> that<00:01:31.829> it<00:01:31.950> wasn't<00:01:32.189> just

00:01:32.480 --> 00:01:32.490 
just to make sure that it wasn't just

00:01:32.490 --> 00:01:34.850 
just to make sure that it wasn't just
the<00:01:32.670> MSMC<00:01:33.150> and<00:01:33.600> all<00:01:33.990> those<00:01:34.140> cases<00:01:34.650> the

the MSMC and all those cases the

00:01:34.860 --> 00:01:37.190 
the MSMC and all those cases the
silencer<00:01:35.400> didn't<00:01:35.820> reduce<00:01:35.939> rico<00:01:36.540> now<00:01:37.020> after

00:01:37.190 --> 00:01:37.200 
silencer didn't reduce rico now after

00:01:37.200 --> 00:01:39.830 
silencer didn't reduce rico now after
that<00:01:37.439> I<00:01:37.590> tested<00:01:37.979> out<00:01:38.040> the<00:01:38.100> type<00:01:38.549> 25<00:01:38.729> and<00:01:39.420> just

00:01:39.830 --> 00:01:39.840 
that I tested out the type 25 and just

00:01:39.840 --> 00:01:41.960 
that I tested out the type 25 and just
like<00:01:39.960> with<00:01:40.140> the<00:01:40.290> MSMC<00:01:40.799> the<00:01:41.159> silencer<00:01:41.670> once

00:01:41.960 --> 00:01:41.970 
like with the MSMC the silencer once

00:01:41.970 --> 00:01:43.999 
like with the MSMC the silencer once
again<00:01:42.240> didn't<00:01:42.540> reduce<00:01:42.659> any<00:01:43.110> rico<00:01:43.560> whatsoever

00:01:43.999 --> 00:01:44.009 
again didn't reduce any rico whatsoever

00:01:44.009 --> 00:01:46.190 
again didn't reduce any rico whatsoever
and<00:01:44.250> in<00:01:44.579> some<00:01:44.790> cases<00:01:45.030> it<00:01:45.299> actually<00:01:45.780> increases

00:01:46.190 --> 00:01:46.200 
and in some cases it actually increases

00:01:46.200 --> 00:01:47.870 
and in some cases it actually increases
the<00:01:46.409> Regal<00:01:46.829> now<00:01:47.250> I<00:01:47.280> could<00:01:47.520> of<00:01:47.610> course<00:01:47.790> be

00:01:47.870 --> 00:01:47.880 
the Regal now I could of course be

00:01:47.880 --> 00:01:49.850 
the Regal now I could of course be
testers<00:01:48.509> error<00:01:48.780> because<00:01:49.110> I<00:01:49.229> didn't<00:01:49.530> test<00:01:49.710> it

00:01:49.850 --> 00:01:49.860 
testers error because I didn't test it

00:01:49.860 --> 00:01:51.200 
testers error because I didn't test it
like<00:01:50.070> a<00:01:50.100> hundred<00:01:50.310> times<00:01:50.520> or<00:01:50.909> anything<00:01:51.180> like

00:01:51.200 --> 00:01:51.210 
like a hundred times or anything like

00:01:51.210 --> 00:01:53.719 
like a hundred times or anything like
that<00:01:51.360> I<00:01:51.720> tested<00:01:52.259> it<00:01:52.320> about<00:01:52.530> ten<00:01:52.860> times<00:01:52.890> per<00:01:53.490> gun

00:01:53.719 --> 00:01:53.729 
that I tested it about ten times per gun

00:01:53.729 --> 00:01:55.850 
that I tested it about ten times per gun
and<00:01:53.939> in<00:01:54.240> some<00:01:54.420> cases<00:01:54.659> it<00:01:54.990> includes<00:01:55.380> the<00:01:55.500> ricoh

00:01:55.850 --> 00:01:55.860 
and in some cases it includes the ricoh

00:01:55.860 --> 00:01:57.260 
and in some cases it includes the ricoh
so<00:01:56.040> I<00:01:56.130> thought<00:01:56.430> that<00:01:56.520> I<00:01:56.579> would<00:01:56.729> just<00:01:56.880> put<00:01:57.090> it<00:01:57.180> in

00:01:57.260 --> 00:01:57.270 
so I thought that I would just put it in

00:01:57.270 --> 00:01:58.760 
so I thought that I would just put it in
the<00:01:57.329> video<00:01:57.479> just<00:01:58.020> to<00:01:58.140> make<00:01:58.290> sure<00:01:58.320> that<00:01:58.649> you

00:01:58.760 --> 00:01:58.770 
the video just to make sure that you

00:01:58.770 --> 00:02:01.160 
the video just to make sure that you
guys<00:01:58.950> also<00:01:59.310> know<00:01:59.670> that<00:01:59.700> now<00:02:00.479> after<00:02:00.719> you<00:02:00.990> type

00:02:01.160 --> 00:02:01.170 
guys also know that now after you type

00:02:01.170 --> 00:02:04.550 
guys also know that now after you type
25<00:02:01.530> I<00:02:01.920> tested<00:02:02.340> out<00:02:02.399> of<00:02:02.520> the<00:02:02.610> qbb<00:02:03.119> LSW<00:02:03.119> and<00:02:04.110> just

00:02:04.550 --> 00:02:04.560 
25 I tested out of the qbb LSW and just

00:02:04.560 --> 00:02:07.160 
25 I tested out of the qbb LSW and just
like<00:02:04.680> with<00:02:04.829> the<00:02:04.950> type<00:02:05.159> 25<00:02:05.340> and<00:02:05.969> the<00:02:06.090> MSMC<00:02:06.540> the

00:02:07.160 --> 00:02:07.170 
like with the type 25 and the MSMC the

00:02:07.170 --> 00:02:09.139 
like with the type 25 and the MSMC the
silencer<00:02:07.680> didn't<00:02:08.099> do<00:02:08.190> anything<00:02:08.610> whatsoever

00:02:09.139 --> 00:02:09.149 
silencer didn't do anything whatsoever

00:02:09.149 --> 00:02:11.869 
silencer didn't do anything whatsoever
to<00:02:09.420> reduce<00:02:09.929> the<00:02:10.080> recoil<00:02:10.229> and<00:02:10.649> after<00:02:11.250> the<00:02:11.370> qbb

00:02:11.869 --> 00:02:11.879 
to reduce the recoil and after the qbb

00:02:11.879 --> 00:02:13.700 
to reduce the recoil and after the qbb
LSW i<00:02:12.720> first<00:02:13.050> went<00:02:13.200> ahead

00:02:13.700 --> 00:02:13.710 
LSW i first went ahead

00:02:13.710 --> 00:02:16.160 
LSW i first went ahead
tested<00:02:14.040> out<00:02:14.130> the<00:02:14.160> r<00:02:14.520> 870<00:02:15.000> shotgun<00:02:15.060> and<00:02:15.720> once

00:02:16.160 --> 00:02:16.170 
tested out the r 870 shotgun and once

00:02:16.170 --> 00:02:17.840 
tested out the r 870 shotgun and once
again<00:02:16.320> the<00:02:16.620> silencer<00:02:17.160> didn't<00:02:17.520> do<00:02:17.580> anything

00:02:17.840 --> 00:02:17.850 
again the silencer didn't do anything

00:02:17.850 --> 00:02:20.840 
again the silencer didn't do anything
now<00:02:18.540> after<00:02:18.750> that<00:02:19.020> I<00:02:19.170> tested<00:02:19.410> out<00:02:19.650> the<00:02:19.710> SVU<00:02:20.310> AS

00:02:20.840 --> 00:02:20.850 
now after that I tested out the SVU AS

00:02:20.850 --> 00:02:22.730 
now after that I tested out the SVU AS
sniper<00:02:21.150> rifle<00:02:21.600> which<00:02:21.990> is<00:02:22.110> the<00:02:22.230> first<00:02:22.440> sniper

00:02:22.730 --> 00:02:22.740 
sniper rifle which is the first sniper

00:02:22.740 --> 00:02:24.170 
sniper rifle which is the first sniper
rifle<00:02:23.100> that<00:02:23.190> you<00:02:23.310> unlock<00:02:23.580> it's<00:02:23.790> one<00:02:23.970> of<00:02:24.060> those

00:02:24.170 --> 00:02:24.180 
rifle that you unlock it's one of those

00:02:24.180 --> 00:02:26.000 
rifle that you unlock it's one of those
semi-automatic<00:02:24.960> sniper<00:02:24.990> rifles<00:02:25.620> so<00:02:25.710> I<00:02:25.740> could

00:02:26.000 --> 00:02:26.010 
semi-automatic sniper rifles so I could

00:02:26.010 --> 00:02:27.890 
semi-automatic sniper rifles so I could
simply<00:02:26.400> spray<00:02:26.670> those<00:02:26.790> bullets<00:02:27.180> as<00:02:27.360> fast<00:02:27.660> as<00:02:27.810> I

00:02:27.890 --> 00:02:27.900 
simply spray those bullets as fast as I

00:02:27.900 --> 00:02:29.690 
simply spray those bullets as fast as I
could<00:02:28.170> but<00:02:28.650> of<00:02:28.770> course<00:02:28.980> once<00:02:29.280> again<00:02:29.550> the

00:02:29.690 --> 00:02:29.700 
could but of course once again the

00:02:29.700 --> 00:02:31.970 
could but of course once again the
silencer<00:02:30.270> didn't<00:02:30.690> do<00:02:30.750> anything<00:02:31.020> and<00:02:31.380> last<00:02:31.890> but

00:02:31.970 --> 00:02:31.980 
silencer didn't do anything and last but

00:02:31.980 --> 00:02:34.220 
silencer didn't do anything and last but
at<00:02:32.160> least<00:02:32.250> I<00:02:32.520> tested<00:02:32.910> out<00:02:32.970> the<00:02:33.030> kap-40<00:02:33.750> pistol

00:02:34.220 --> 00:02:34.230 
at least I tested out the kap-40 pistol

00:02:34.230 --> 00:02:35.810 
at least I tested out the kap-40 pistol
and<00:02:34.410> just<00:02:34.770> like<00:02:34.950> with<00:02:35.070> all<00:02:35.340> the<00:02:35.490> other<00:02:35.580> guns

00:02:35.810 --> 00:02:35.820 
and just like with all the other guns

00:02:35.820 --> 00:02:37.550 
and just like with all the other guns
that<00:02:35.940> I've<00:02:36.060> tested<00:02:36.450> the<00:02:36.630> silencer<00:02:37.200> didn't

00:02:37.550 --> 00:02:37.560 
that I've tested the silencer didn't

00:02:37.560 --> 00:02:40.430 
that I've tested the silencer didn't
reduce<00:02:37.680> recoil<00:02:38.160> in<00:02:38.550> any<00:02:39.150> way<00:02:39.390> whatsoever<00:02:39.630> so

00:02:40.430 --> 00:02:40.440 
reduce recoil in any way whatsoever so

00:02:40.440 --> 00:02:41.720 
reduce recoil in any way whatsoever so
the<00:02:40.560> next<00:02:40.680> time<00:02:40.860> that<00:02:40.920> somebody<00:02:41.250> tells<00:02:41.610> you

00:02:41.720 --> 00:02:41.730 
the next time that somebody tells you

00:02:41.730 --> 00:02:43.970 
the next time that somebody tells you
that<00:02:41.940> the<00:02:42.090> silencer<00:02:42.570> reduces<00:02:42.990> rico<00:02:43.380> you<00:02:43.770> can

00:02:43.970 --> 00:02:43.980 
that the silencer reduces rico you can

00:02:43.980 --> 00:02:45.440 
that the silencer reduces rico you can
tell<00:02:44.190> them<00:02:44.340> that<00:02:44.520> that<00:02:44.700> myth<00:02:44.910> is<00:02:45.120> already

00:02:45.440 --> 00:02:45.450 
tell them that that myth is already

00:02:45.450 --> 00:02:47.420 
tell them that that myth is already
busted<00:02:45.960> and<00:02:46.140> that<00:02:46.290> the<00:02:46.410> silencer<00:02:46.950> doesn't<00:02:47.340> do

00:02:47.420 --> 00:02:47.430 
busted and that the silencer doesn't do

00:02:47.430 --> 00:02:50.150 
busted and that the silencer doesn't do
anything<00:02:48.000> whatsoever<00:02:48.480> to<00:02:48.930> reduce<00:02:49.500> the<00:02:49.710> rico

00:02:50.150 --> 00:02:50.160 
anything whatsoever to reduce the rico

00:02:50.160 --> 00:02:51.950 
anything whatsoever to reduce the rico
but<00:02:50.580> anyway<00:02:50.790> guys<00:02:50.940> that<00:02:51.300> was<00:02:51.450> it<00:02:51.600> for<00:02:51.630> today's
