last smallish kind of mop mouse which
was<00:03:12.579> a<00:03:12.700> VX<00:03:13.030> revolution<00:03:14.280> when<00:03:15.280> I<00:03:15.310> did<00:03:15.669> use<00:03:15.970> it<00:03:16.169> I

00:03:17.569 --> 00:03:17.579 
was a VX revolution when I did use it I

00:03:17.579 --> 00:03:22.789 
was a VX revolution when I did use it I
didn't<00:03:18.579> think<00:03:19.329> I<00:03:19.540> had<00:03:19.569> as<00:03:19.870> much<00:03:20.790> cramps<00:03:21.790> after

00:03:22.789 --> 00:03:22.799 
didn't think I had as much cramps after

00:03:22.799 --> 00:03:26.069 
didn't think I had as much cramps after
after<00:03:23.799> about<00:03:24.010> you<00:03:24.220> know<00:03:24.340> 15<00:03:24.879> 20<00:03:25.449> minutes<00:03:25.750> or<00:03:25.900> so

00:03:26.069 --> 00:03:26.079 
after about you know 15 20 minutes or so

00:03:26.079 --> 00:03:29.159 
after about you know 15 20 minutes or so
I'd<00:03:26.590> really<00:03:27.010> feel<00:03:27.060> feel<00:03:28.060> the<00:03:28.209> hands<00:03:28.569> cramping

00:03:29.159 --> 00:03:29.169 
I'd really feel feel the hands cramping

00:03:29.169 --> 00:03:31.500 
I'd really feel feel the hands cramping
up<00:03:29.440> on<00:03:29.590> it<00:03:29.709> but<00:03:29.919> this<00:03:30.040> one<00:03:30.310> is<00:03:30.760> nice<00:03:31.060> and<00:03:31.090> smooth

00:03:31.500 --> 00:03:31.510 
up on it but this one is nice and smooth

00:03:31.510 --> 00:03:34.020 
up on it but this one is nice and smooth
I<00:03:31.840> don't<00:03:32.290> have<00:03:32.440> the<00:03:32.620> old<00:03:32.769> Mouse<00:03:33.220> anymore<00:03:33.699> the<00:03:33.879> X

00:03:34.020 --> 00:03:34.030 
I don't have the old Mouse anymore the X

00:03:34.030 --> 00:03:36.229 
I don't have the old Mouse anymore the X
revolution<00:03:34.510> but<00:03:34.659> I<00:03:34.900> think<00:03:35.349> maybe<00:03:35.530> this<00:03:36.099> is

00:03:36.229 --> 00:03:36.239 
revolution but I think maybe this is

00:03:36.239 --> 00:03:38.939 
revolution but I think maybe this is
little<00:03:37.239> higher<00:03:37.449> humps<00:03:37.900> for<00:03:38.169> me<00:03:38.290> to<00:03:38.470> relaxed<00:03:38.829> my

00:03:38.939 --> 00:03:38.949 
little higher humps for me to relaxed my

00:03:38.949 --> 00:03:43.110 
little higher humps for me to relaxed my
hands<00:03:39.280> on<00:03:39.690> which<00:03:40.690> was<00:03:40.870> good<00:03:41.340> because<00:03:42.340> I'm<00:03:42.940> used

00:03:43.110 --> 00:03:43.120 
hands on which was good because I'm used

00:03:43.120 --> 00:03:45.420 
hands on which was good because I'm used
to<00:03:43.239> usually<00:03:43.659> the<00:03:43.810> bigger<00:03:44.229> big<00:03:44.829> amount<00:03:45.129> mice

00:03:45.420 --> 00:03:45.430 
to usually the bigger big amount mice

00:03:45.430 --> 00:03:49.289 
to usually the bigger big amount mice
like<00:03:45.900> current<00:03:46.900> one<00:03:46.989> I<00:03:47.019> usually<00:03:47.459> uses<00:03:48.459> em<00:03:48.639> 950

00:03:49.289 --> 00:03:49.299 
like current one I usually uses em 950

00:03:49.299 --> 00:03:51.949 
like current one I usually uses em 950
hoping<00:03:49.629> they<00:03:49.720> update<00:03:50.109> that<00:03:50.379> soon<00:03:50.709> actually

00:03:51.949 --> 00:03:51.959 
hoping they update that soon actually

00:03:51.959 --> 00:03:54.809 
hoping they update that soon actually
and<00:03:52.959> yeah<00:03:53.650> we've<00:03:53.889> got<00:03:54.040> the<00:03:54.430> ridges<00:03:54.790> here

00:03:54.809 --> 00:03:54.819 
and yeah we've got the ridges here

00:03:54.819 --> 00:03:58.250 
and yeah we've got the ridges here
smooth<00:03:55.479> I<00:03:56.290> mean<00:03:56.919> it's<00:03:57.069> just<00:03:57.159> a<00:03:57.400> normal<00:03:57.729> red

00:03:58.250 --> 00:03:58.260 
smooth I mean it's just a normal red

00:03:58.260 --> 00:04:01.710 
smooth I mean it's just a normal red
optical<00:03:59.260> tracking<00:03:59.709> sensor<00:04:00.310> you<00:04:01.150> can<00:04:01.180> expect

00:04:01.710 --> 00:04:01.720 
optical tracking sensor you can expect

00:04:01.720 --> 00:04:04.800 
optical tracking sensor you can expect
much<00:04:01.840> for<00:04:02.229> the<00:04:02.889> price<00:04:03.190> you<00:04:03.370> pay<00:04:03.609> but<00:04:03.669> it<00:04:04.659> was

00:04:04.800 --> 00:04:04.810 
much for the price you pay but it was

00:04:04.810 --> 00:04:06.659 
much for the price you pay but it was
pretty<00:04:05.139> good<00:04:05.470> I'm<00:04:05.829> just<00:04:06.069> to<00:04:06.159> give<00:04:06.310> you<00:04:06.430> a<00:04:06.459> bit

00:04:06.659 --> 00:04:06.669 
pretty good I'm just to give you a bit

00:04:06.669 --> 00:04:08.699 
pretty good I'm just to give you a bit
of<00:04:06.699> a<00:04:06.909> feel<00:04:07.209> about<00:04:07.449> the<00:04:07.599> size<00:04:07.840> comparison<00:04:08.319> I've

00:04:08.699 --> 00:04:08.709 
of a feel about the size comparison I've

00:04:08.709 --> 00:04:14.729 
of a feel about the size comparison I've
got<00:04:08.889> my<00:04:10.229> m9<00:04:11.229> 50<00:04:12.239> that's<00:04:13.239> a<00:04:13.419> cube<00:04:14.379> bit<00:04:14.560> of<00:04:14.650> a

00:04:14.729 --> 00:04:14.739 
got my m9 50 that's a cube bit of a

00:04:14.739 --> 00:04:16.939 
got my m9 50 that's a cube bit of a
field<00:04:15.010> and<00:04:15.190> size<00:04:15.459> difference

00:04:16.939 --> 00:04:16.949 
field and size difference

00:04:16.949 --> 00:04:20.870 
field and size difference
I'm<00:04:17.949> definitely<00:04:18.639> much<00:04:18.909> more<00:04:18.940> used<00:04:19.419> to<00:04:19.630> the

00:04:20.870 --> 00:04:20.880 
I'm definitely much more used to the

00:04:20.880 --> 00:04:25.080 
I'm definitely much more used to the
size<00:04:21.880> of<00:04:22.719> the<00:04:23.050> m9<00:04:23.710> 50<00:04:24.159> and<00:04:24.340> the

00:04:25.080 --> 00:04:25.090 
size of the m9 50 and the

00:04:25.090 --> 00:04:26.850 
size of the m9 50 and the
appreciate<00:04:25.630> the<00:04:25.840> extra<00:04:26.169> buttons<00:04:26.470> bit<00:04:26.650> more

00:04:26.850 --> 00:04:26.860 
appreciate the extra buttons bit more

00:04:26.860 --> 00:04:29.310 
appreciate the extra buttons bit more
the<00:04:27.010> fun<00:04:27.220> button<00:04:27.610> and<00:04:28.389> so<00:04:28.720> forth

00:04:29.310 --> 00:04:29.320 
the fun button and so forth

00:04:29.320 --> 00:04:33.180 
the fun button and so forth
now<00:04:30.190> one<00:04:30.400> thing<00:04:30.430> I<00:04:31.860> realized<00:04:32.860> when<00:04:33.010> I<00:04:33.070> was

00:04:33.180 --> 00:04:33.190 
now one thing I realized when I was

00:04:33.190 --> 00:04:35.100 
now one thing I realized when I was
playing<00:04:33.400> around<00:04:33.490> was<00:04:33.729> that<00:04:33.760> the<00:04:34.600> mouse<00:04:34.780> itself

00:04:35.100 --> 00:04:35.110 
playing around was that the mouse itself

00:04:35.110 --> 00:04:38.090 
playing around was that the mouse itself
is<00:04:35.440> unifying<00:04:35.949> and<00:04:36.250> it's<00:04:36.400> got<00:04:36.610> the<00:04:36.960> unifying

00:04:38.090 --> 00:04:38.100 
is unifying and it's got the unifying

00:04:38.100 --> 00:04:41.790 
is unifying and it's got the unifying
symbol<00:04:39.100> on<00:04:39.820> it<00:04:39.940> so<00:04:40.630> I<00:04:40.960> was<00:04:41.320> able<00:04:41.530> to

00:04:41.790 --> 00:04:41.800 
symbol on it so I was able to

00:04:41.800 --> 00:04:44.310 
symbol on it so I was able to
successfully<00:04:42.250> quickly<00:04:42.850> pair<00:04:43.090> that<00:04:43.240> up<00:04:43.320> with

00:04:44.310 --> 00:04:44.320 
successfully quickly pair that up with

00:04:44.320 --> 00:04:47.180 
successfully quickly pair that up with
my<00:04:44.350> other<00:04:45.330> unifying<00:04:46.330> reciever<00:04:46.690> for<00:04:46.900> my<00:04:47.020> other

00:04:47.180 --> 00:04:47.190 
my other unifying reciever for my other

00:04:47.190 --> 00:04:50.430 
my other unifying reciever for my other
mice<00:04:48.190> which<00:04:48.699> was<00:04:48.970> it<00:04:49.210> was<00:04:49.270> really<00:04:49.780> easy<00:04:50.080> you

00:04:50.430 --> 00:04:50.440 
mice which was it was really easy you

00:04:50.440 --> 00:04:53.219 
mice which was it was really easy you
mean<00:04:50.650> downloads<00:04:51.520> a<00:04:51.850> unifying<00:04:52.510> software<00:04:52.780> and

00:04:53.219 --> 00:04:53.229 
mean downloads a unifying software and

00:04:53.229 --> 00:04:57.120 
mean downloads a unifying software and
all<00:04:53.320> it<00:04:53.470> did<00:04:53.650> plug<00:04:54.580> it<00:04:54.699> in<00:04:54.820> and<00:04:55.060> then<00:04:55.990> it's<00:04:56.919> hard

00:04:57.120 --> 00:04:57.130 
all it did plug it in and then it's hard

00:04:57.130 --> 00:05:00.150 
all it did plug it in and then it's hard
you<00:04:57.250> to<00:04:57.400> turn<00:04:57.639> on<00:04:58.380> the<00:04:59.380> mouse<00:04:59.590> at<00:04:59.830> a<00:04:59.860> specific

00:05:00.150 --> 00:05:00.160 
you to turn on the mouse at a specific

00:05:00.160 --> 00:05:02.219 
you to turn on the mouse at a specific
time<00:05:00.580> and<00:05:00.639> it<00:05:00.970> was<00:05:01.120> magically<00:05:01.570> connected<00:05:01.870> now

00:05:02.219 --> 00:05:02.229 
time and it was magically connected now

00:05:02.229 --> 00:05:04.590 
time and it was magically connected now
that<00:05:02.500> is<00:05:02.710> really<00:05:03.370> good<00:05:03.550> as<00:05:03.700> of<00:05:03.910> year<00:05:04.120> so<00:05:04.389> I

00:05:04.590 --> 00:05:04.600 
that is really good as of year so I

00:05:04.600 --> 00:05:07.110 
that is really good as of year so I
really<00:05:05.110> love<00:05:05.350> that<00:05:05.380> just<00:05:06.370> remember<00:05:06.820> though

00:05:07.110 --> 00:05:07.120 
really love that just remember though
