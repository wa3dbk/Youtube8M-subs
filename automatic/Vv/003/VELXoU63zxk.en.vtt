00:00:09.660 --> 00:00:13.620
 from afar and with intense solar 

00:00:11.460 --> 00:00:15.690
 light working abakanskaya service

 amenities have already replaced 106 

00:00:15.690 --> 00:00:20.939
 regulatory devices until the end of 2015 

00:00:18.270 --> 00:00:22.859
 40 more and it's like normal 

00:00:20.939 --> 00:00:24.330
 three-section traffic lights and with 

00:00:22.859 --> 00:00:26.039
 additional sections 

00:00:24.330 --> 00:00:28.199
 sound and many 

00:00:26.039 --> 00:00:30.330
 software modes in the world exist 

00:00:28.199 --> 00:00:31.980
 traffic lights tram rail 

00:00:30.330 --> 00:00:34.320
 personal there is even a regulating device 

00:00:31.980 --> 00:00:36.510
 for cyclists and motor sports and 

00:00:34.320 --> 00:00:38.280
 each one is very important in its own way 

00:00:36.510 --> 00:00:39.840
 some fun facts on 

00:00:38.280 --> 00:00:41.790
 calculations sociologists residents of large 

00:00:39.840 --> 00:00:44.219
 megapolises waiting for the green signal 

00:00:41.790 --> 00:00:46.200
 traffic lights spend about six months 

00:00:44.219 --> 00:00:48.809
 its capital of germany life there 

00:00:46.200 --> 00:00:51.059
 traffic light showing 13 signals instead 

00:00:48.809 --> 00:00:52.680
 ordinary three 2 true to focus on 

00:00:51.059 --> 00:00:55.469
 readings of such a device and 

00:00:52.680 --> 00:00:57.120
 it is very difficult for drivers and pedestrians to Korea 

00:00:55.469 --> 00:00:58.800
 traffic lights appeared only a few years 

00:00:57.120 --> 00:01:00.210
 back for this the role of electronic 

00:00:58.800 --> 00:01:02.250
 devices and performed girls 

00:01:00.210 --> 00:01:04.559
 regulators and for example in india and 

00:01:02.250 --> 00:01:06.360
 Ethiopia generally crossing correspondence 

00:01:04.559 --> 00:01:08.460
 amazing way in the absence of 

00:01:06.360 --> 00:01:10.320
 any subsidiary marks this 

00:01:08.460 --> 00:01:12.810
 odessa bb there are no traffic lights 

00:01:10.320 --> 00:01:14.850
 unintelligible road markings not guards 

00:01:12.810 --> 00:01:16.070
 Yet they manage drivers 

00:01:14.850 --> 00:01:18.090
 learned to slip between 

00:01:16.070 --> 00:01:19.979
 multidirectional flow feel 

00:01:18.090 --> 00:01:22.110
 when you need to give way or slow down 

00:01:19.979 --> 00:01:24.270
 right in the middle of the intersection oh yes and 

00:01:22.110 --> 00:01:26.100
 pedestrians here too are crossing the road as 

00:01:24.270 --> 00:01:27.900
 they want it but unfortunately funny 

00:01:26.100 --> 00:01:28.680
 The picture noticeably spoils the data 

00:01:27.900 --> 00:01:30.810
 statistics 

00:01:28.680 --> 00:01:31.920
 Ethiopia 2 in the world 

00:01:30.810 --> 00:01:33.630
 road deaths 

00:01:31.920 --> 00:01:35.430
 today we are all so used to 

00:01:33.630 --> 00:01:37.619
 that at every crossroads our movement 

00:01:35.430 --> 00:01:39.390
 regulate the one-eyed sentry that and not 

00:01:37.619 --> 00:01:40.079
 think about the meaning of the traffic light in 

00:01:39.390 --> 00:01:42.240
 our life 

00:01:40.079 --> 00:01:45.720
 and what if it did not become, we decided 

00:01:42.240 --> 00:01:47.820
 to find out opinions about the ends were in the sign 

00:01:45.720 --> 00:01:49.710
 and drove on it just as there is 

00:01:47.820 --> 00:01:51.810
 pedestrian crossings would have crossed them 

00:01:49.710 --> 00:01:55.920
 you think that you can live it would be 

00:01:51.810 --> 00:01:58.740
 no traffic light until aus a mess why 

00:01:55.920 --> 00:02:01.560
 because I would like as Sulla and who was driving 

00:01:58.740 --> 00:02:05.100
 wanted how the right light carries those will 

00:02:01.560 --> 00:02:07.380
 those roads would be swamped and miserable 

00:02:05.100 --> 00:02:10.470
 Cases think it would be impossible 

00:02:07.380 --> 00:02:12.360
 think up how to regulate slurry no 

00:02:10.470 --> 00:02:14.760
 I do not know how it is possible because we 

00:02:12.360 --> 00:02:15.090
 Now a whole nation which is not in 

00:02:14.760 --> 00:02:17.970
 so 

00:02:15.090 --> 00:02:19.590
 and older people news quietly go 

00:02:17.970 --> 00:02:21.540
 they do not have time to run across 

00:02:19.590 --> 00:02:25.050
 what is your favorite color at the traffic lights what 

00:02:21.540 --> 00:02:27.390
 green well because you can 

00:02:25.050 --> 00:02:28.770
 go and not stand to think as if 

00:02:27.390 --> 00:02:32.430
 crossed the road if it were not 

00:02:28.770 --> 00:02:35.970
 Never traffic lights we do not like you 

00:02:32.430 --> 00:02:42.890
 did not cross the road at all as to 

00:02:35.970 --> 00:02:46.960
 you went on a horse ride 

00:02:42.890 --> 00:02:50.950
 what is your favorite color of traffic light 

00:02:46.960 --> 00:02:53.820
 green because it resembles 

00:02:50.950 --> 00:02:56.260
 beautiful greens do you think why 

00:02:53.820 --> 00:02:58.380
 101 a year ago this particular device 

00:02:56.260 --> 00:03:01.930
 invented to adjust movement 

00:02:58.380 --> 00:03:05.980
 I think for the safety of pedestrians first 

00:03:01.930 --> 00:03:08.140
 all I do not know what was in my head 

00:03:05.980 --> 00:03:09.490
 that moment in people is a man of genius 

00:03:08.140 --> 00:03:11.500
 invented the traffic light because 

00:03:09.490 --> 00:03:13.950
 imagine even under the horse hit 

00:03:11.500 --> 00:03:16.900
 Ostap bender yes means and the horses were already 

00:03:13.950 --> 00:03:19.300
 dangerous to traffic in traffic lights 

00:03:16.900 --> 00:03:21.040
 she is so much like a spoon 

00:03:19.300 --> 00:03:22.240
 the wheel entered our lives that I 

00:03:21.040 --> 00:03:25.080
 it seems just don't notice not 

00:03:22.240 --> 00:03:27.490
 think because it is wonderful 

00:03:25.080 --> 00:03:30.940
 here are some additional things 

00:03:27.490 --> 00:03:33.430
 how can overseas countries us right 

00:03:30.940 --> 00:03:35.020
 left here these are our simple elementary 

00:03:33.430 --> 00:03:37.870
 traffic lights especially i'm from krasnoyarsk 

00:03:35.020 --> 00:03:39.750
 and so I still liked that now 

00:03:37.870 --> 00:03:42.160
 traffic lights hang how much 

00:03:39.750 --> 00:03:44.070
 information how many seconds are left 

00:03:42.160 --> 00:03:45.810
 before crossing into it is generally wonderful 

00:03:44.070 --> 00:03:48.760
 minimum 

00:03:45.810 --> 00:03:50.290
 information maximum benefit you knew that 

00:03:48.760 --> 00:03:52.870
 tomorrow is a holiday like this 

00:03:50.290 --> 00:03:55.299
 August 5th traffic light, I do not for 

00:03:52.870 --> 00:03:58.629
 what a day is what do you think why 

00:03:55.299 --> 00:04:01.239
 I need such a holiday what date I do not know 

00:03:58.629 --> 00:04:04.180
 traffic light important in our life well yes 

00:04:01.239 --> 00:04:06.849
 why is it important in our lives because 

00:04:04.180 --> 00:04:10.480
 it shows when to go 

00:04:06.849 --> 00:04:12.220
 the road when you have to go and if it were not 

00:04:10.480 --> 00:04:17.910
 was how would you know when to 

00:04:12.220 --> 00:04:21.660
 cross the calendar would run 

00:04:17.910 --> 00:04:21.660
 it would be funny
