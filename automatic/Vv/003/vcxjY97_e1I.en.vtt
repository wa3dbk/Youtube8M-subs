00:02:14.680 --> 00:02:16.830 
of your portfolio site I think is highly
important<00:02:15.100> because<00:02:15.220> it<00:02:15.790> allows<00:02:16.030> you<00:02:16.240> to<00:02:16.510> then

00:02:16.830 --> 00:02:16.840 
important because it allows you to then

00:02:16.840 --> 00:02:21.750 
important because it allows you to then
be<00:02:17.230> less<00:02:18.600> less<00:02:19.600> formal<00:02:20.170> than<00:02:20.770> you<00:02:21.370> would<00:02:21.610> if

00:02:21.750 --> 00:02:21.760 
be less less formal than you would if

00:02:21.760 --> 00:02:24.420 
be less less formal than you would if
