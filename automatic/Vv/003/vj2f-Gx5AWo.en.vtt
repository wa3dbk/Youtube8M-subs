00:00:00.440 --> 00:00:06.830
The 2015 Audi allroad is the best car for
you if your ideal is a mix of station wagon

00:00:06.830 --> 00:00:08.330
and crossover SUV.

00:00:08.330 --> 00:00:13.930
Judging by its very modest sales numbers the
allroad isn't the ideal of a great number of people.

00:00:13.949 --> 00:00:19.180
But like most mash-ups, it combines some of
the best and some of the worst from each of

00:00:19.180 --> 00:00:20.660
its influences.

00:00:20.660 --> 00:00:27.260
Is it right for you? I'm Chuck Giametta. Join
me for a CarPreview video review of the 2015

00:00:27.260 --> 00:00:32.220
Audi allroad.

00:00:32.280 --> 00:00:40.600
[music intro]

00:00:45.429 --> 00:00:52.269
The first allroad sold from model years 2001
through 2005. It was based on Audi's midsize

00:00:52.269 --> 00:00:57.229
A6 line and you could get it with a 335-horsepower
V-8.

00:00:57.229 --> 00:01:03.479
Today's second-generation version - formal
name, allroad quattro, all lower-case - debuted

00:01:03.479 --> 00:01:10.679
for 2013. Based on the A4 compact-car platform,
it's 300 pounds lighter than the original

00:01:10.690 --> 00:01:16.890
and comes only with a turbocharged four-cylinder
engine. It displaced the A4 Avant station

00:01:16.890 --> 00:01:22.600
wagon in Audi's lineup and slots between two
traditional crossovers: the less expensive

00:01:22.600 --> 00:01:26.390
Q5 and the larger, costlier Q7.

00:01:26.390 --> 00:01:32.860
That leaves the allroad as either a high-riding
station wagon or a squished-down SUV.

00:01:32.860 --> 00:01:38.800
The grille has vertical chrome struts, as
on other Audi crossovers. And xenon headlights

00:01:38.810 --> 00:01:43.090
are standard for 2015, even on the least expensive
model.

00:01:43.090 --> 00:01:49.070
These prominent roof rails and contrasting
cladding are other crossover cues. This white

00:01:49.070 --> 00:01:53.680
paint, by the way, along with basic black,
is one of only a few colors for which Audi

00:01:53.680 --> 00:01:59.820
won't charge you $550 extra. For another thousand
bucks, they'll make the cladding match the

00:01:59.820 --> 00:02:02.320
body - but only in certain colors

00:02:02.320 --> 00:02:08.030
The allroad has 7.1 inches of ground clearance.
That's about an inch less than the Q5 but

00:02:08.030 --> 00:02:10.490
about two inches more than the average car.

00:02:10.490 --> 00:02:16.880
Audis quattro all-wheel-drive system is standard,
but don't mistake "allroad" for "off-road."

00:02:16.890 --> 00:02:23.170
The design brief here is gravel paths and
snowy streets, not wilderness trails. In reality

00:02:23.170 --> 00:02:28.870
an allroad will go most anywhere the typical
crossover owner is likely to venture. And

00:02:28.870 --> 00:02:33.170
with some advantages over a bulkier, imitation
SUV.

00:02:33.170 --> 00:02:38.620
For example, the center of gravity is lower,
so it's less tippy-feeling in turns. You do

00:02:38.620 --> 00:02:41.900
give up a truly elevated seating position,
though.

00:02:41.900 --> 00:02:47.760
With a roofline a full seven inches shorter
than a Q5's, you can load skies or bikes with

00:02:47.770 --> 00:02:52.100
less effort. But that also means less room
for people and cargo.

00:02:52.100 --> 00:02:58.030
Absent a crossover's expansive greenhouse,
this feels very much like the compact station

00:02:58.030 --> 00:03:00.890
wagon it pretends not to be.

00:03:00.890 --> 00:03:05.700
The dashboard looks a little dated but does
the job. Room in front is good and you're

00:03:05.700 --> 00:03:12.010
treated to Audi's typical upscale decor. Leather
upholstery and power front seats are standard,

00:03:12.010 --> 00:03:17.390
so is real aluminum trim; genuine wood is
a $350 option.

00:03:17.390 --> 00:03:23.840
Joining the panoramic moonroof among standard
features for 2015 is three-zone climate control

00:03:23.840 --> 00:03:25.650
and rear privacy glass.

00:03:25.650 --> 00:03:30.580
Included with the top-line Prestige model
and optional for the others is Audi's nicely

00:03:30.580 --> 00:03:36.980
organized central-control Multi Media Interface
and a navigation system that features Google

00:03:36.980 --> 00:03:38.390
Earth mapping.

00:03:38.390 --> 00:03:42.680
The rear seat is not a highlight. Knee space
gets tight with the front buckets more than

00:03:42.680 --> 00:03:48.260
halfway back. Headroom isn't generous. And
you feel a little buried on this low-set cushion.

00:03:50.660 --> 00:03:55.700
Compact crossovers with higher rooflines give
you more cargo volume, obviously, but how

00:03:55.700 --> 00:03:58.239
often do you really load to the ceiling?

00:03:58.239 --> 00:04:04.379
With some 30 cubic feet behind the rear seat
and 50 with it folded, luggage space is typical

00:04:04.379 --> 00:04:05.910
of a small station wagon.

00:04:05.910 --> 00:04:12.129
And for 2015, every allroad comes with a power
liftgate.

00:04:12.129 --> 00:04:17.280
Shared with other cars and crossovers in the
Volkswagen/Audi family, the two-liter turbo

00:04:17.280 --> 00:04:23.740
is a gem. It has 220 horsepower and a stout
258 pound-feet of torque.

00:04:23.740 --> 00:04:28.680
Linked with an alert eight-speed automatic
transmission it accelerates the allroad quicker

00:04:28.680 --> 00:04:34.820
than the 6.4-second zero-to-60 time would
suggest. More important, it delivers fine

00:04:34.820 --> 00:04:38.100
passing power and worry-free merging ability.

00:04:38.100 --> 00:04:44.660
That 0-60 time, by the way, is about a half
second quicker than a Q5 with this engine.

00:04:44.660 --> 00:04:50.800
That's another benefit of the more carlike
allroad -- it's 200 pounds lighter than a Q5.

00:04:50.800 --> 00:04:56.480
Less mass and the aerodynamic advantages of
a lower profile translate to pretty decent

00:04:56.490 --> 00:05:02.310
fuel economy, too. Still the allroad does
weigh more than most cars its size. Combined

00:05:02.310 --> 00:05:07.800
with its loftier ride height, that means slower
reactions to steering inputs and more body

00:05:07.800 --> 00:05:11.440
lean in corners than you get with a sporty
sedan.

00:05:11.440 --> 00:05:16.880
Overall though, this is a satisfying driving
experience. The allroad underpins its extra

00:05:16.880 --> 00:05:20.550
measure of mobility with real European refinement.

00:05:20.550 --> 00:05:25.930
The pricing befits European breeding, as well,
though it's not out of line with premium-brand

00:05:25.930 --> 00:05:30.610
alternatives. Precisely what those alternatives
are is difficult to nail down.

00:05:30.610 --> 00:05:39.460
Volvo comes closest, with its new, raised-suspension,
all-wheel-drive V60 Cross Country: looks familiar, doesn't it?

00:05:39.460 --> 00:05:44.520
Then there's BMW's new X4 -- a
kind of fastback-four-door coupe take on the

00:05:44.530 --> 00:05:46.370
allroad concept.

00:05:46.370 --> 00:05:52.560
Even Audi seems indecisive. Reports say it
may replace the allroad around model-year

00:05:52.560 --> 00:06:00.920
2017 by, interestingly enough, restoring the
A4 Avant to its U.S. lineup.

00:06:00.930 --> 00:06:05.979
Until then, this will remain someone's automotive
ideal. For more on the allroard and other
