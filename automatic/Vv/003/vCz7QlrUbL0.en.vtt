00:00:11.469 --> 00:00:17.290 

hi<00:00:13.389> until<00:00:14.389> now<00:00:14.599> we've<00:00:15.559> been<00:00:16.490> been<00:00:16.939> working

00:00:17.290 --> 00:00:17.300 
hi until now we've been been working

00:00:17.300 --> 00:00:19.960 
hi until now we've been been working
very<00:00:17.330> largely<00:00:17.960> with<00:00:18.230> straight<00:00:18.590> lines<00:00:18.980> we've

00:00:19.960 --> 00:00:19.970 
very largely with straight lines we've

00:00:19.970 --> 00:00:23.650 
very largely with straight lines we've
been<00:00:20.119> working<00:00:20.960> with<00:00:20.990> flat<00:00:21.890> surfaces<00:00:22.669> and<00:00:23.090> I've

00:00:23.650 --> 00:00:23.660 
been working with flat surfaces and I've

00:00:23.660 --> 00:00:27.069 
been working with flat surfaces and I've
been<00:00:24.250> taking<00:00:25.250> the<00:00:25.660> complexity<00:00:26.660> of<00:00:26.689> things

00:00:27.069 --> 00:00:27.079 
been taking the complexity of things

00:00:27.079 --> 00:00:30.819 
been taking the complexity of things
away<00:00:27.890> we've<00:00:28.250> had<00:00:28.460> white<00:00:28.790> forms<00:00:29.480> and<00:00:29.829> still

00:00:30.819 --> 00:00:30.829 
away we've had white forms and still

00:00:30.829 --> 00:00:33.970 
away we've had white forms and still
live<00:00:31.070> so<00:00:31.540> now<00:00:32.540> I<00:00:32.570> want<00:00:32.870> to<00:00:32.930> bring<00:00:33.079> in<00:00:33.260> a<00:00:33.530> bit

00:00:33.970 --> 00:00:33.980 
live so now I want to bring in a bit

00:00:33.980 --> 00:00:38.229 
live so now I want to bring in a bit
more<00:00:34.100> fun<00:00:34.480> and<00:00:35.480> that's<00:00:35.570> curves<00:00:37.030> the<00:00:38.030> world

00:00:38.229 --> 00:00:38.239 
more fun and that's curves the world

00:00:38.239 --> 00:00:42.069 
more fun and that's curves the world
isn't<00:00:38.629> straight<00:00:39.050> the<00:00:40.010> world<00:00:40.250> is<00:00:40.610> is<00:00:41.079> these

00:00:42.069 --> 00:00:42.079 
isn't straight the world is is these

00:00:42.079 --> 00:00:44.980 
isn't straight the world is is these
curved<00:00:42.620> there's<00:00:43.550> a<00:00:43.610> sensuality<00:00:44.540> about<00:00:44.570> curves

00:00:44.980 --> 00:00:44.990 
curved there's a sensuality about curves

00:00:44.990 --> 00:00:46.870 
curved there's a sensuality about curves
if<00:00:45.140> you<00:00:45.230> can't<00:00:45.500> draw<00:00:45.770> a<00:00:45.800> curve<00:00:46.070> like<00:00:46.310> your

00:00:46.870 --> 00:00:46.880 
if you can't draw a curve like your

00:00:46.880 --> 00:00:48.479 
if you can't draw a curve like your
drawings<00:00:47.270> are<00:00:47.360> gonna<00:00:47.480> be<00:00:47.630> dull<00:00:47.840> and<00:00:48.050> boring

00:00:48.479 --> 00:00:48.489 
drawings are gonna be dull and boring

00:00:48.489 --> 00:00:51.670 
drawings are gonna be dull and boring
but<00:00:49.489> curves<00:00:49.940> are<00:00:50.329> more<00:00:50.840> difficult<00:00:51.079> they

00:00:51.670 --> 00:00:51.680 
but curves are more difficult they

00:00:51.680 --> 00:00:55.780 
but curves are more difficult they
require<00:00:52.100> a<00:00:52.520> bit<00:00:52.850> more<00:00:53.120> skill<00:00:54.310> so<00:00:55.310> it's<00:00:55.460> a<00:00:55.520> skill

00:00:55.780 --> 00:00:55.790 
require a bit more skill so it's a skill

00:00:55.790 --> 00:00:59.680 
require a bit more skill so it's a skill
you<00:00:55.820> have<00:00:55.970> to<00:00:56.210> practice<00:00:56.950> but<00:00:57.950> it<00:00:58.579> is<00:00:58.820> it

00:00:59.680 --> 00:00:59.690 
you have to practice but it is it

00:00:59.690 --> 00:01:03.160 
you have to practice but it is it
essentially<00:01:00.440> means<00:01:01.239> doing<00:01:02.239> this<00:01:02.420> with<00:01:02.989> your

00:01:03.160 --> 00:01:03.170 
essentially means doing this with your

00:01:03.170 --> 00:01:10.270 
essentially means doing this with your
hand<00:01:03.820> that<00:01:04.820> is<00:01:05.259> describing<00:01:06.259> a<00:01:06.670> circle<00:01:09.280> there's

00:01:10.270 --> 00:01:10.280 
hand that is describing a circle there's

00:01:10.280 --> 00:01:12.580 
hand that is describing a circle there's

you<00:01:31.369> are<00:01:31.400> and<00:01:33.130> the<00:01:34.130> boy<00:01:34.310> drew<00:01:35.090> a<00:01:35.119> circle<00:01:35.960> in<00:01:36.500> the

00:01:36.899 --> 00:01:36.909 
you are and the boy drew a circle in the

00:01:36.909 --> 00:01:41.109 
you are and the boy drew a circle in the
sand<00:01:38.530> perfect<00:01:39.530> circle<00:01:40.159> and<00:01:40.430> all<00:01:40.670> he<00:01:40.970> was<00:01:41.090> doing

00:01:41.109 --> 00:01:41.119 
sand perfect circle and all he was doing

00:01:41.119 --> 00:01:44.770 
sand perfect circle and all he was doing
was<00:01:41.330> describing<00:01:42.049> from<00:01:42.470> his<00:01:42.619> arm<00:01:43.210> this<00:01:44.210> perfect

00:01:44.770 --> 00:01:44.780 
was describing from his arm this perfect

00:01:44.780 --> 00:01:46.870 
was describing from his arm this perfect
circle<00:01:45.200> and<00:01:45.290> you<00:01:46.100> will<00:01:46.250> have<00:01:46.460> to<00:01:46.610> practice

00:01:46.870 --> 00:01:46.880 
circle and you will have to practice

00:01:46.880 --> 00:01:50.710 
circle and you will have to practice
either<00:01:47.799> drawing<00:01:48.799> circles<00:01:49.310> from<00:01:49.580> your<00:01:50.090> fingers

00:01:50.710 --> 00:01:50.720 
either drawing circles from your fingers

00:01:50.720 --> 00:01:56.530 
either drawing circles from your fingers
from<00:01:51.710> your<00:01:51.799> wrists<00:01:53.080> from<00:01:54.080> your<00:01:54.320> elbow<00:01:54.619> or<00:01:55.540> from

00:01:56.530 --> 00:01:56.540 
from your wrists from your elbow or from

00:01:56.540 --> 00:02:01.480 
from your wrists from your elbow or from
your<00:01:56.750> arm<00:01:58.390> so<00:01:59.390> all<00:01:59.659> of<00:02:00.020> these<00:02:00.229> are<00:02:00.500> Cirque<00:02:01.280> and

00:02:01.480 --> 00:02:01.490 
your arm so all of these are Cirque and

00:02:01.490 --> 00:02:04.330 
your arm so all of these are Cirque and
circular<00:02:02.420> and<00:02:02.630> ellipses<00:02:03.380> going<00:02:03.799> thataway<00:02:04.040> so

00:02:04.330 --> 00:02:04.340 
circular and ellipses going thataway so

00:02:04.340 --> 00:02:07.539 
circular and ellipses going thataway so
it<00:02:05.470> this<00:02:06.470> is<00:02:06.680> what<00:02:06.860> we're<00:02:07.009> going<00:02:07.130> to<00:02:07.189> play<00:02:07.369> with

00:02:07.539 --> 00:02:07.549 
it this is what we're going to play with

00:02:07.549 --> 00:02:12.690 
it this is what we're going to play with
now<00:02:07.700> and<00:02:08.530> basically<00:02:09.530> it's<00:02:10.220> an<00:02:10.429> action<00:02:10.819> of<00:02:11.680> just

00:02:12.690 --> 00:02:12.700 
now and basically it's an action of just

00:02:12.700 --> 00:02:18.979 
now and basically it's an action of just
practicing<00:02:15.250> so<00:02:16.250> we<00:02:16.370> can<00:02:16.689> create<00:02:17.689> the

00:02:18.979 --> 00:02:18.989 
practicing so we can create the

00:02:18.989 --> 00:02:23.420 
practicing so we can create the
the<00:02:19.230> form<00:02:19.650> of<00:02:19.920> a<00:02:20.420> of<00:02:21.420> a<00:02:21.569> bow<00:02:21.780> and<00:02:22.189> if<00:02:23.189> we're

00:02:23.420 --> 00:02:23.430 
the form of a of a bow and if we're

00:02:23.430 --> 00:02:27.220 
the form of a of a bow and if we're
drawing<00:02:23.730> a<00:02:24.469> bow<00:02:25.469> or<00:02:25.829> a<00:02:25.920> cop<00:02:26.370> or<00:02:26.670> anything

00:02:27.220 --> 00:02:27.230 
drawing a bow or a cop or anything

00:02:27.230 --> 00:02:31.099 
drawing a bow or a cop or anything
that's<00:02:28.879> it's<00:02:29.879> basically<00:02:30.510> what<00:02:30.659> we<00:02:30.810> do<00:02:30.930> and

00:02:31.099 --> 00:02:31.109 
that's it's basically what we do and

00:02:31.109 --> 00:02:36.289 
that's it's basically what we do and
then<00:02:31.230> we<00:02:31.349> can<00:02:31.379> smear<00:02:32.069> the<00:02:32.280> darkness<00:02:32.849> and<00:02:35.299> use

00:02:36.289 --> 00:02:36.299 
then we can smear the darkness and use

00:02:36.299 --> 00:02:37.729 
then we can smear the darkness and use
those<00:02:36.540> tones<00:02:36.930> we<00:02:37.170> were<00:02:37.290> talking<00:02:37.680> about

00:02:37.729 --> 00:02:37.739 
those tones we were talking about

00:02:37.739 --> 00:02:42.349 
those tones we were talking about
earlier<00:02:39.469> last<00:02:40.469> week<00:02:40.650> use<00:02:41.579> the<00:02:41.790> tone<00:02:42.030> get<00:02:42.269> the

00:02:42.349 --> 00:02:42.359 
earlier last week use the tone get the

00:02:42.359 --> 00:02:45.170 
earlier last week use the tone get the
darkness<00:02:42.810> to<00:02:42.989> throw<00:02:43.260> dark<00:02:44.129> imagine<00:02:45.060> that

00:02:45.170 --> 00:02:45.180 
darkness to throw dark imagine that

00:02:45.180 --> 00:02:47.270 
darkness to throw dark imagine that
light<00:02:45.840> is<00:02:46.049> only<00:02:46.230> coming<00:02:46.709> on<00:02:46.829> that<00:02:47.010> side

00:02:47.270 --> 00:02:47.280 
light is only coming on that side

00:02:47.280 --> 00:02:50.899 
light is only coming on that side
catching<00:02:48.060> this<00:02:48.150> inside<00:02:48.629> of<00:02:48.810> it<00:02:48.930> so<00:02:49.670> all<00:02:50.670> right

00:02:50.899 --> 00:02:50.909 
catching this inside of it so all right

00:02:50.909 --> 00:02:52.640 
catching this inside of it so all right
I've<00:02:51.540> done<00:02:51.750> this<00:02:51.840> lots<00:02:52.019> of<00:02:52.200> times<00:02:52.260> and<00:02:52.590> that

00:02:52.640 --> 00:02:52.650 
I've done this lots of times and that

00:02:52.650 --> 00:02:53.300 
I've done this lots of times and that
looks<00:02:52.859> great

00:02:53.300 --> 00:02:53.310 
looks great

00:02:53.310 --> 00:02:58.929 
looks great
you<00:02:54.269> can<00:02:55.760> practice<00:02:56.760> drawing<00:02:57.799> anything

00:02:58.929 --> 00:02:58.939 
you can practice drawing anything

00:02:58.939 --> 00:03:03.110 
you can practice drawing anything
circular<00:02:59.939> a<00:03:00.150> cup<00:03:00.599> is<00:03:00.959> a<00:03:01.680> great<00:03:02.129> thing<00:03:02.849> to
