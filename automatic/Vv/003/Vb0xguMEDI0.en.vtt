patient's<00:01:23.120> point<00:01:23.270> of<00:01:23.420> view<00:01:23.630> day<00:01:24.080> I<00:01:24.440> guess<00:01:25.220> I'm

00:01:25.780 --> 00:01:25.790 
patient's point of view day I guess I'm

00:01:25.790 --> 00:01:31.300 
patient's point of view day I guess I'm
looking<00:01:26.120> for<00:01:27.550> a<00:01:28.550> treatment<00:01:29.420> plan<00:01:30.310> basically

00:01:31.300 --> 00:01:31.310 
looking for a treatment plan basically

00:01:31.310 --> 00:01:34.780 
looking for a treatment plan basically
for<00:01:31.550> cancer<00:01:32.450> had<00:01:32.840> a<00:01:32.870> knife<00:01:33.080> cancer<00:01:33.790> which

00:01:34.780 --> 00:01:34.790 
for cancer had a knife cancer which

00:01:34.790 --> 00:01:40.120 
for cancer had a knife cancer which
usually<00:01:35.060> they<00:01:35.330> do<00:01:35.390> not<00:01:35.690> find<00:01:38.050> adequate<00:01:39.130> cost

00:01:40.120 --> 00:01:40.130 
usually they do not find adequate cost

00:01:40.130 --> 00:01:41.800 
usually they do not find adequate cost
effective<00:01:40.610> treatment<00:01:41.060> in<00:01:41.180> their<00:01:41.330> countries

00:01:41.800 --> 00:01:41.810 
effective treatment in their countries

00:01:41.810 --> 00:01:48.580 
effective treatment in their countries
so<00:01:42.520> I<00:01:43.520> think<00:01:44.110> our<00:01:45.110> Hospital<00:01:46.090> is<00:01:47.090> a<00:01:47.150> good<00:01:47.590> choice

00:01:48.580 --> 00:01:48.590 
so I think our Hospital is a good choice

00:01:48.590 --> 00:01:58.240 
so I think our Hospital is a good choice
for<00:01:49.220> their<00:01:49.600> needs<00:01:51.910> so<00:01:53.020> we<00:01:54.020> are<00:01:54.310> trying<00:01:55.310> to<00:01:57.250> set

00:01:58.240 --> 00:01:58.250 
for their needs so we are trying to set

00:01:58.250 --> 00:02:03.580 
for their needs so we are trying to set
up<00:01:58.370> a<00:01:58.580> board<00:02:00.490> for<00:02:01.490> tumor<00:02:01.910> patients<00:02:02.590> from

00:02:03.580 --> 00:02:03.590 
up a board for tumor patients from

00:02:03.590 --> 00:02:06.760 
up a board for tumor patients from
pathology<00:02:03.800> side<00:02:04.280> surgical<00:02:05.060> side<00:02:05.470> radiology

00:02:06.760 --> 00:02:06.770 
pathology side surgical side radiology

00:02:06.770 --> 00:02:09.850 
pathology side surgical side radiology
chemotherapy<00:02:07.190> and<00:02:07.820> we<00:02:07.850> decide<00:02:08.630> what<00:02:09.440> which

00:02:09.850 --> 00:02:09.860 
chemotherapy and we decide what which

00:02:09.860 --> 00:02:11.590 
chemotherapy and we decide what which
treatment<00:02:10.340> is<00:02:10.399> the<00:02:10.520> best<00:02:10.550> for<00:02:10.970> this<00:02:11.120> kind<00:02:11.480> of

00:02:11.590 --> 00:02:11.600 
treatment is the best for this kind of

00:02:11.600 --> 00:02:15.430 
treatment is the best for this kind of
patient<00:02:11.870> and<00:02:12.290> then<00:02:12.410> we<00:02:13.390> do<00:02:14.390> force<00:02:14.750> maybe

00:02:15.430 --> 00:02:15.440 
patient and then we do force maybe

00:02:15.440 --> 00:02:19.620 
patient and then we do force maybe
surgery<00:02:15.980> for<00:02:16.310> the<00:02:16.520> tumor<00:02:16.880> and<00:02:17.150> then<00:02:17.530> as<00:02:18.530> a

00:02:19.620 --> 00:02:19.630 
surgery for the tumor and then as a

00:02:19.630 --> 00:02:24.400 
surgery for the tumor and then as a
additional<00:02:20.630> 30<00:02:23.110> radiotherapy<00:02:24.110> or<00:02:24.140> the
