they're<00:01:52.619> all<00:01:52.770> pretty<00:01:52.979> decent<00:01:53.460> likenesses<00:01:53.909> of

00:01:53.960 --> 00:01:53.970 
they're all pretty decent likenesses of

00:01:53.970 --> 00:01:58.820 
they're all pretty decent likenesses of
the<00:01:54.470> figures<00:01:55.470> in<00:01:55.830> in<00:01:56.310> the<00:01:56.460> game<00:01:56.670> for<00:01:57.619> the<00:01:58.619> fact

00:01:58.820 --> 00:01:58.830 
the figures in in the game for the fact

00:01:58.830 --> 00:02:00.770 
the figures in in the game for the fact
that<00:01:58.950> they<00:01:59.130> just<00:01:59.159> spring<00:01:59.850> up<00:02:00.030> and<00:02:00.240> fall<00:02:00.540> back

00:02:00.770 --> 00:02:00.780 
that they just spring up and fall back

00:02:00.780 --> 00:02:03.980 
that they just spring up and fall back
down<00:02:00.890> into<00:02:01.890> their<00:02:02.580> vehicle<00:02:03.030> modes<00:02:03.210> the<00:02:03.780> cool

00:02:03.980 --> 00:02:03.990 
down into their vehicle modes the cool

00:02:03.990 --> 00:02:07.429 
down into their vehicle modes the cool
thing<00:02:04.259> is<00:02:05.210> the<00:02:06.210> little<00:02:06.479> base<00:02:06.689> that<00:02:06.990> comes<00:02:07.170> with

00:02:07.429 --> 00:02:07.439 
thing is the little base that comes with

00:02:07.439 --> 00:02:09.469 
thing is the little base that comes with
them<00:02:07.650> it's<00:02:08.310> actually<00:02:08.579> in<00:02:08.939> the<00:02:09.000> shape<00:02:09.179> of<00:02:09.360> a

00:02:09.469 --> 00:02:09.479 
them it's actually in the shape of a

00:02:09.479 --> 00:02:11.780 
them it's actually in the shape of a
matrix<00:02:09.989> which<00:02:10.979> I<00:02:11.129> thought<00:02:11.310> was<00:02:11.459> pretty<00:02:11.549> cool

00:02:11.780 --> 00:02:11.790 
matrix which I thought was pretty cool

00:02:11.790 --> 00:02:15.289 
matrix which I thought was pretty cool
and<00:02:13.819> basically<00:02:14.819> there's<00:02:15.030> a<00:02:15.090> little

00:02:15.289 --> 00:02:15.299 
and basically there's a little

00:02:15.299 --> 00:02:17.540 
and basically there's a little
magnifying<00:02:15.810> glass<00:02:16.110> here<00:02:16.349> on<00:02:16.560> the<00:02:16.680> bottom<00:02:17.040> and

00:02:17.540 --> 00:02:17.550 
magnifying glass here on the bottom and

00:02:17.550 --> 00:02:20.229 
magnifying glass here on the bottom and
and<00:02:17.989> you<00:02:18.989> take

00:02:20.229 --> 00:02:20.239 
and you take

00:02:20.239 --> 00:02:23.229 
and you take
there's<00:02:21.049> a<00:02:21.140> little<00:02:21.349> QR<00:02:21.859> code<00:02:22.280> on<00:02:22.310> the<00:02:22.670> bottom

00:02:23.229 --> 00:02:23.239 
there's a little QR code on the bottom

00:02:23.239 --> 00:02:25.209 
there's a little QR code on the bottom
of<00:02:23.359> each<00:02:23.540> figure<00:02:23.870> and<00:02:24.680> you<00:02:24.799> just<00:02:24.920> kind<00:02:25.129> of

00:02:25.209 --> 00:02:25.219 
of each figure and you just kind of

00:02:25.219 --> 00:02:29.610 
of each figure and you just kind of
there's<00:02:25.459> a<00:02:25.519> little<00:02:25.870> tab<00:02:27.790> here<00:02:28.790> on<00:02:29.120> the<00:02:29.390> top

00:02:29.610 --> 00:02:29.620 
there's a little tab here on the top

00:02:29.620 --> 00:02:31.990 
there's a little tab here on the top
line<00:02:30.620> it<00:02:30.769> up<00:02:30.859> with<00:02:31.069> the<00:02:31.219> little<00:02:31.370> hole<00:02:31.640> in<00:02:31.879> the

00:02:31.990 --> 00:02:32.000 
line it up with the little hole in the

00:02:32.000 --> 00:02:35.679 
line it up with the little hole in the
bottom<00:02:32.150> and<00:02:33.109> then<00:02:33.290> that<00:02:33.469> puts<00:02:33.739> the<00:02:34.510> they<00:02:35.510> don't

00:02:35.679 --> 00:02:35.689 
bottom and then that puts the they don't

00:02:35.689 --> 00:02:38.229 
bottom and then that puts the they don't
it<00:02:35.900> doesn't<00:02:36.069> stay<00:02:37.069> so<00:02:37.549> you<00:02:37.609> kind<00:02:37.849> of<00:02:37.879> have<00:02:38.060> to

00:02:38.229 --> 00:02:38.239 
it doesn't stay so you kind of have to

00:02:38.239 --> 00:02:40.959 
it doesn't stay so you kind of have to
hold<00:02:38.989> it<00:02:39.139> together<00:02:39.290> and<00:02:39.709> that<00:02:40.489> kind<00:02:40.730> of<00:02:40.790> just

00:02:40.959 --> 00:02:40.969 
hold it together and that kind of just

00:02:40.969 --> 00:02:43.780 
hold it together and that kind of just
magnifies<00:02:41.510> the<00:02:41.840> code<00:02:42.079> for<00:02:42.469> the<00:02:42.650> camera<00:02:43.159> on

00:04:01.030 --> 00:04:01.040 
health and that's very helpful when

health and that's very helpful when
you're<00:04:01.159> trying<00:04:01.220> to<00:04:01.519> earn<00:04:01.669> coins<00:04:01.970> because<00:04:02.509> even

00:04:02.979 --> 00:04:02.989 
you're trying to earn coins because even

00:04:02.989 --> 00:04:04.839 
you're trying to earn coins because even
if<00:04:03.109> you<00:04:03.229> fail<00:04:03.530> a<00:04:03.560> mission<00:04:03.769> you<00:04:04.220> keep<00:04:04.489> all<00:04:04.729> the

00:04:04.839 --> 00:04:04.849 
if you fail a mission you keep all the

00:04:04.849 --> 00:04:09.009 
if you fail a mission you keep all the
coins<00:04:06.040> if<00:04:07.040> you<00:04:07.189> don't<00:04:07.430> have<00:04:07.699> these<00:04:07.939> yeah<00:04:08.810> it

00:04:09.009 --> 00:04:09.019 
coins if you don't have these yeah it

00:04:09.019 --> 00:04:11.949 
coins if you don't have these yeah it
cost<00:04:09.409> you<00:04:09.590> six<00:04:09.889> hundred<00:04:10.280> coins<00:04:10.459> to<00:04:10.959> recharge

00:04:11.949 --> 00:04:11.959 
cost you six hundred coins to recharge

00:04:11.959 --> 00:04:14.020 
cost you six hundred coins to recharge
which<00:04:12.259> probably<00:04:13.069> cost<00:04:13.340> you<00:04:13.519> more<00:04:13.699> than<00:04:13.909> what

00:04:14.020 --> 00:04:14.030 
which probably cost you more than what

00:04:14.030 --> 00:04:16.420 
which probably cost you more than what
you<00:04:14.180> earned<00:04:14.419> before<00:04:15.019> you<00:04:15.169> died<00:04:15.409> but<00:04:16.159> if<00:04:16.310> you

00:04:16.420 --> 00:04:16.430 
you earned before you died but if you

00:04:16.430 --> 00:04:18.339 
you earned before you died but if you
have<00:04:16.609> these<00:04:16.820> you<00:04:17.090> recharge<00:04:17.599> for<00:04:17.810> free<00:04:18.079> so

00:04:18.339 --> 00:04:18.349 
have these you recharge for free so

00:04:18.349 --> 00:04:20.259 
have these you recharge for free so
basically<00:04:19.009> you<00:04:19.130> keep<00:04:19.310> your<00:04:19.549> coins<00:04:19.820> and<00:04:20.000> it's<00:04:20.180> a

00:04:20.259 --> 00:04:20.269 
basically you keep your coins and it's a

00:04:20.269 --> 00:04:22.240 
basically you keep your coins and it's a
way<00:04:20.389> to<00:04:20.449> get<00:04:20.750> to<00:04:20.870> some<00:04:21.079> of<00:04:21.199> the<00:04:21.320> ridiculous

00:04:22.240 --> 00:04:22.250 
way to get to some of the ridiculous

00:04:22.250 --> 00:04:25.089 
way to get to some of the ridiculous
amounts<00:04:22.789> especially<00:04:23.560> once<00:04:24.560> you<00:04:24.650> get<00:04:24.860> the

00:04:25.089 --> 00:04:25.099 
amounts especially once you get the

00:04:25.099 --> 00:04:31.690 
amounts especially once you get the
level<00:04:25.580> I<00:04:26.020> think<00:04:27.020> it's<00:04:27.289> 40<00:04:30.130> area<00:04:31.130> it's<00:04:31.460> like

00:04:31.690 --> 00:04:31.700 
level I think it's 40 area it's like

00:04:31.700 --> 00:04:33.520 
level I think it's 40 area it's like
60,000<00:04:32.570> coins<00:04:32.779> which<00:04:32.960> is

00:04:33.520 --> 00:04:33.530 
60,000 coins which is

00:04:33.530 --> 00:04:36.130 
60,000 coins which is
insane<00:04:34.010> especially<00:04:34.610> when<00:04:35.030> you<00:04:35.180> start<00:04:35.960> getting

00:04:36.130 --> 00:04:36.140 
insane especially when you start getting

00:04:36.140 --> 00:04:39.520 
insane especially when you start getting
the<00:04:36.410> very<00:04:36.740> hard<00:04:37.190> levels<00:04:38.150> which<00:04:38.870> are<00:04:39.080> almost

00:04:39.520 --> 00:04:39.530 
the very hard levels which are almost

00:04:39.530 --> 00:04:40.960 
the very hard levels which are almost
impossible<00:04:40.070> to<00:04:40.130> get<00:04:40.250> through<00:04:40.490> and<00:04:40.730> the<00:04:40.790> game

00:04:40.960 --> 00:04:40.970 
impossible to get through and the game

00:04:40.970 --> 00:04:42.430 
impossible to get through and the game
keeps<00:04:41.270> telling<00:04:41.570> you<00:04:41.630> need<00:04:41.750> to<00:04:41.840> upgrade<00:04:42.020> which

00:04:42.430 --> 00:04:42.440 
keeps telling you need to upgrade which
