00:00:00.320 --> 00:00:03.409
 what tasted better the old boats farming someone a few bites of 

00:00:03.409 --> 00:00:04.910
 has taken 

00:00:04.910 --> 00:00:08.329
 and all the boats disaster but tastes good on the jar 

00:00:08.329 --> 00:00:09.829
 that is the question today 

00:00:09.829 --> 00:00:13.099
 do we choose a new one they had ex ceo or do we choose anyway 

00:00:13.879 --> 00:00:14.750
 to hold 

00:00:14.750 --> 00:00:17.750
 audi a4 the car that fc oss en den haag vvv 

00:00:19.269 --> 00:00:20.849
 jansen 

00:00:20.849 --> 00:00:23.089
 you 

00:00:23.089 --> 00:00:26.089
 9 

00:00:35.650 --> 00:00:39.100
 those who scour the internet encounter a lot of uses of the audi a4 

00:00:39.640 --> 00:00:43.000
 have found this at a dealer in Utrecht he comes from 2007 

00:00:43.900 --> 00:00:47.760
 15,000 euros out on the clock ankles exactly as much as the ferry dike 

00:00:47.760 --> 00:00:50.990
 those who exist 32,900 a 50 euros 

00:00:51.710 --> 00:00:56.390
 when this audi two benefits the head is off and it is also full of options 

00:00:56.390 --> 00:00:59.830
 but is that sufficient because the wish to leave the hall 

00:00:59.830 --> 00:01:02.710
 but without a lot I also look at then you see that the old you really nothing 

00:01:02.710 --> 00:01:04.670
 exact copies are from each other 

00:01:04.670 --> 00:01:07.170
 they are exactly the same engine blocks 

00:01:07.170 --> 00:01:11.509
 so only a dispute in this audi love and with 8 euros 163 pk 

00:01:12.150 --> 00:01:15.760
 a limited part you only get to 150 yes that's a small difference in it 

00:01:15.760 --> 00:01:18.580
 engine management system and actually don't notice it 

00:01:18.580 --> 00:01:22.400
 the audi is fast and has a higher top speed but the ex the honor is there 

00:01:22.400 --> 00:01:25.110
 economical and therefore has favorable energy labels 

00:01:25.110 --> 00:01:28.110
 Underneath the skin some things have changed 

00:01:32.470 --> 00:01:35.850
 underneath you are ex neo Nazi not exactly equal to each other 

00:01:35.850 --> 00:01:39.240
 so the ex uses a lot with fresh one by one suspension while the 

00:01:39.240 --> 00:01:42.090
 all those who have a4 with a multilink construction 

00:01:42.090 --> 00:01:44.140
 it all seems to have some technical flaws 

00:01:44.140 --> 00:01:48.710
 But it comes down to the oil turning some restless days on the way and that the ex 

00:01:48.710 --> 00:01:50.820
 much more like a gent 

00:01:50.820 --> 00:01:55.040
 the audi has not seen her work in the steering wheel and also 300 euros 

00:01:56.920 --> 00:01:59.930
 these parents do strikingly the same 

00:01:59.930 --> 00:02:03.220
 it's all fairly light and direct but you really don't have much feeling 

00:02:04.340 --> 00:02:08.640
 In addition, the ex ceo is remarkably comfortable or bad roads when I'm in 

00:02:08.640 --> 00:02:10.589
 this audit and of which 

00:02:10.589 --> 00:02:12.109
 it was very tough 

00:02:12.109 --> 00:02:15.619
 we notice that the cars start to bounce and then your index is whole 

00:02:15.619 --> 00:02:18.529
 simply less bothering 

00:02:18.529 --> 00:02:21.189
 Yes 

00:02:21.189 --> 00:02:24.189
 Yes 

00:02:24.789 --> 00:02:26.109
 Yes 

00:02:26.109 --> 00:02:29.109
 House 

00:02:31.729 --> 00:02:35.169
 I also notice that it is better to have a decrease 

00:02:35.169 --> 00:02:39.459
 they are extensively adjustable but also less sporty if not and I sit 

00:02:39.459 --> 00:02:42.889
 just a lot better so that is definitely a plus for me 

00:02:42.889 --> 00:02:44.789
 this audit 

00:02:44.789 --> 00:02:46.369
 X 

00:02:46.369 --> 00:02:48.139
 you 

00:02:48.139 --> 00:02:50.389
 you 

00:02:50.389 --> 00:02:53.389
 the 

00:02:57.579 --> 00:03:00.579
 year 

00:03:05.629 --> 00:03:09.279
 the young feyenoord can look the same to the parents 

00:03:09.279 --> 00:03:12.299
 but whoever looks further they see quite a few differences between the a4 and 

00:03:12.299 --> 00:03:15.759
 excel i'm through the a4 and the ex ceo 

00:03:15.759 --> 00:03:19.469
 the ek are there is indeed and better developed brother of the a4 

00:03:19.469 --> 00:03:22.479
 that you also notice less nervous handling of the car 

00:03:22.479 --> 00:03:25.900
 it turns out that most cars are there together so in short we can 

00:03:25.899 --> 00:03:26.720
 to conclude 

00:03:26.720 --> 00:03:29.970
 if you attach great importance to afterwards, choose the car with one in it 

00:03:30.599 --> 00:03:33.109
 However, too much value in matters such as comfort 

00:03:33.109 --> 00:03:34.319
 price quality 

00:03:34.319 --> 00:03:35.489
 and warranty 

00:03:35.489 --> 00:03:38.929
 then you're with the ex much better 

00:03:38.929 --> 00:03:41.369
 I would know 

00:03:41.369 --> 00:03:43.179
 by 

00:03:43.179 --> 00:03:45.409
 the 

00:03:45.409 --> 00:03:48.409
 9 

00:03:52.589 --> 00:03:53.319
