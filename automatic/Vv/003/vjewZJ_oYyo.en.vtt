00:00:16.930 --> 00:00:27.400
 Have a Test Drive Impression on Winding Road 

00:00:20.230 --> 00:00:32.710
 a Let's check now that the corner is passing through a series of scenes 

00:00:27.400 --> 00:00:38.980
 First steering of reaction is it is very smooth 

00:00:32.710 --> 00:00:44.980
 In particular , there is no ambiguity around neutrality that has begun to cut slightly after this neutrality steer 

00:00:38.980 --> 00:00:46.870
 From the moment you start steering, you will be able to make a straight turn on the street 

00:00:44.980 --> 00:00:47.390
 Impression will be obtained 

00:00:46.870 --> 00:00:52.579
 After this 

00:00:47.390 --> 00:00:56.440
 Reno: This is the height of all the small parts of the steering angle 

00:00:52.579 --> 00:01:00.879
 Of course the steering itself is also important 

00:00:56.440 --> 00:01:06.190
 Actually I 'm fine I also heard body rigidity 

00:01:00.879 --> 00:01:10.540
 In this new Alphard to develop this new 

00:01:06.190 --> 00:01:15.909
 Focusing on improving body rigidity 

00:01:10.540 --> 00:01:16.430
 Sometimes the assembly, for example attached to the body around the opening of the door 

00:01:15.909 --> 00:01:22.550
 spot 

00:01:16.430 --> 00:01:23.000
 It is the reinforcing material for the welding of increased out so to I'm ne ne body reinforcement it is from 

00:01:22.550 --> 00:01:29.420
 Ne 

00:01:23.000 --> 00:01:30.200
 And even these were such efforts with or put a hose Ri or put Blaze around the floor 

00:01:29.420 --> 00:01:36.450
 is 

00:01:30.200 --> 00:01:43.950
 Also still I I'm using the partially adhesive when assembling the body 

00:01:36.450 --> 00:01:49.770
 After that, the torsional stiffness of the body is very high the next moment the front begins to bend 

00:01:43.950 --> 00:01:51.390
 There are also many places where you can secure the pair at the same time. 

00:01:49.770 --> 00:01:57.120
 I think it is a feature 

00:01:51.390 --> 00:02:02.110
 And that's especially sporty. 

00:01:57.120 --> 00:02:06.820
 I don't think it's set up to make you feel 

00:02:02.110 --> 00:02:12.780
 I think there is a sense of security very much or against the operation of the driver 

00:02:06.820 --> 00:02:18.660
 It is a setting that you can understand that it is straightforward and natural reaction 

00:02:12.780 --> 00:02:25.830
 It but I think that you hear sound Tteyuu this issue is what this road no 5 

00:02:18.660 --> 00:02:32.800
 In it does not even be on the fact that say to the road noise to zero, but of that child of load 

00:02:25.830 --> 00:02:39.610
 It is also characteristic of this new Alphard that maintenance does not affect the room now 

00:02:32.800 --> 00:02:45.730
 It is around approximately 2000 rotation is God rotational speed when climbing a hill there 

00:02:39.610 --> 00:02:52.790
 Only in about now 500 rpm rotation another meet a little not even from a speed range that will Deko 

00:02:45.730 --> 00:02:57.909
 But went up, you can obtain a sufficient strength alone it 

00:02:52.790 --> 00:02:57.909
 Then I think that I want to step on the accelerator soon, so I will go 

00:03:00.340 --> 00:03:03.239
 But maybe 

00:03:04.180 --> 00:03:11.210
 It's a not went to the acceleration by using the high-speed range in the rotation range now 

00:03:10.390 --> 00:03:12.470
 What 

00:03:11.210 --> 00:03:18.980
 very 

00:03:12.470 --> 00:03:20.630
 I realize that the power is rising in line with the rise in engine speed in a straight line 

00:03:18.980 --> 00:03:27.410
 Was also confirmed 

00:03:20.630 --> 00:03:32.490
 After that , it's more about your engine than you think- it's a powerful sound 

00:03:27.410 --> 00:03:34.470
 I think it can make sure the engine sound of course never noisy is 

00:03:32.490 --> 00:03:39.720
 Sounds good 

00:03:34.470 --> 00:03:48.240
 Now we have moved from now the driver's seat in the second-row seat 

00:03:39.720 --> 00:03:52.140
 When I'm there that often become even second-row seat well in the driver's seat in the case of such a car 

00:03:48.240 --> 00:03:54.460
 For example, you may think that the engine noise 

00:03:52.140 --> 00:04:00.700
 The sound of the road know is loud 

00:03:54.460 --> 00:04:03.460
 Such things tend to happen when it comes to 

00:04:00.700 --> 00:04:06.750
 It's not the case 

00:04:03.460 --> 00:04:08.569
 Road noise favor is also very good 

00:04:06.750 --> 00:04:14.810
 I'm steady 

00:04:08.569 --> 00:04:17.810
 The engine sound is also heard in the driver's seat and the engine heard in the second row seat 

00:04:14.810 --> 00:04:24.860
 I think there is a big difference 

00:04:17.810 --> 00:04:28.130
 In small places , small bumps on the road surface that can not be seen by 5 

00:04:24.860 --> 00:04:32.360
 It does not uncomfortably feeling say 

00:04:28.130 --> 00:04:37.130
 The driver's seat has a few more seats than the driver's seat 

00:04:32.360 --> 00:04:40.910
 I think that there is a place that said whether it will be transmitted to 

00:04:37.130 --> 00:04:48.120
 But originally the sheet is very relaxing and relaxing 

00:04:40.910 --> 00:04:49.040
 Sufficient satisfaction and think in the total because It is the seat has been obtained even so kind of space 

00:04:48.120 --> 00:04:53.980
 Ah ah ah ah 

00:04:49.040 --> 00:04:56.320
 I think it seems to be obtained even in February seats 

00:04:53.980 --> 00:05:00.040
 I wonder how it was 

00:04:56.320 --> 00:05:03.040
 New Alphard Development Concept 

00:05:00.040 --> 00:05:07.030
 Was a different space luxury saloon 

00:05:03.040 --> 00:05:11.680
 I think that it was exactly the way of vip 

00:05:07.030 --> 00:05:16.310
 Of course it's no surprise that even if you ride with your family 

00:05:11.680 --> 00:05:21.700
 The form of the minivan has is similar to riding a luxury saloon 

00:05:16.310 --> 00:05:21.700
 It wasn't a car that could get that kind of atmosphere
