00:00:02.389 --> 00:00:02.399 
before we start carving the remaining

before we start carving the remaining
parts<00:00:02.639> of<00:00:02.669> the<00:00:02.790> katana<00:00:03.149> which<00:00:03.689> are

parts of the katana which are
essentially<00:00:04.259> the<00:00:04.350> parts<00:00:04.589> that<00:00:04.710> make<00:00:04.859> up<00:00:04.890> the

00:00:05.059 --> 00:00:05.069 
essentially the parts that make up the

rely<00:00:12.179> on<00:00:12.240> each<00:00:12.450> other<00:00:12.690> a<00:00:12.780> lot<00:00:13.019> more<00:00:13.290> than<00:00:13.530> the

00:00:13.640 --> 00:00:13.650 
rely on each other a lot more than the

00:00:13.650 --> 00:00:15.680 
rely on each other a lot more than the
parts<00:00:13.950> that<00:00:14.099> we've<00:00:14.219> been<00:00:14.460> creating<00:00:15.299> already

00:00:15.680 --> 00:00:15.690 
parts that we've been creating already

00:00:15.690 --> 00:00:17.840 
parts that we've been creating already
and<00:00:15.990> even<00:00:16.920> though<00:00:17.070> they're<00:00:17.250> not<00:00:17.279> really

and even though they're not really
difficult<00:00:18.510> you<00:00:18.630> do<00:00:18.779> need<00:00:18.930> some<00:00:18.990> of<00:00:19.289> the

00:00:19.340 --> 00:00:19.350 
difficult you do need some of the

00:00:19.350 --> 00:00:22.670 
difficult you do need some of the
dimensions<00:00:19.920> from<00:00:20.730> like<00:00:20.939> the<00:00:21.090> Edo<00:00:21.320> to<00:00:22.320> carve

00:01:50.579 --> 00:01:52.100 
one quarters inch you can see it's
actually<00:01:50.790> going<00:01:50.880> to<00:01:50.939> be<00:01:51.060> recessed<00:01:51.509> into<00:01:51.810> these

00:01:52.100 --> 00:01:52.110 
actually going to be recessed into these

00:01:52.110 --> 00:01:54.889 
actually going to be recessed into these
two<00:01:52.320> parts<00:01:52.680> and<00:01:53.180> the<00:01:54.180> actual<00:01:54.479> distance<00:01:54.720> we're

00:01:54.889 --> 00:01:54.899 
two parts and the actual distance we're

00:01:54.899 --> 00:01:56.719 
two parts and the actual distance we're
going<00:01:55.020> to<00:01:55.079> be<00:01:55.140> wrapping<00:01:55.380> is<00:01:55.710> only<00:01:56.280> eight<00:01:56.520> and

that<00:01:59.490> recess

00:02:06.700 --> 00:02:06.710 

00:02:06.710 --> 00:02:10.300 

in<00:02:06.830> terms<00:02:07.520> of<00:02:07.700> the<00:02:07.790> shape<00:02:08.030> of<00:02:08.240> our<00:02:08.750> sky<00:02:09.310> there's

00:02:10.300 --> 00:02:10.310 
in terms of the shape of our sky there's

00:02:10.310 --> 00:02:12.880 
in terms of the shape of our sky there's
a<00:02:10.369> couple<00:02:10.550> different<00:02:10.670> possible<00:02:11.330> ones<00:02:11.740> the<00:02:12.740> one

00:02:12.880 --> 00:02:12.890 
a couple different possible ones the one

00:02:12.890 --> 00:02:15.100 
a couple different possible ones the one
that<00:02:13.040> we'll<00:02:13.190> be<00:02:13.310> using<00:02:13.459> is<00:02:13.819> shown<00:02:14.600> here<00:02:14.959> as

00:02:15.100 --> 00:02:15.110 
that we'll be using is shown here as

00:02:15.110 --> 00:02:17.170 
that we'll be using is shown here as
kind<00:02:15.530> of<00:02:15.590> a<00:02:15.709> curved<00:02:16.010> tapered<00:02:16.610> shape<00:02:16.850> I

00:02:17.170 --> 00:02:17.180 
kind of a curved tapered shape I

00:02:17.180 --> 00:02:19.630 
kind of a curved tapered shape I
actually<00:02:17.900> find<00:02:18.260> this<00:02:18.350> one<00:02:18.590> easy<00:02:19.040> to<00:02:19.250> construct

00:02:19.630 --> 00:02:19.640 
actually find this one easy to construct

00:02:19.640 --> 00:02:21.640 
actually find this one easy to construct
and<00:02:20.030> also<00:02:20.390> find<00:02:20.600> it<00:02:20.690> the<00:02:20.780> most<00:02:20.810> attractive<00:02:21.260> so

00:02:21.640 --> 00:02:21.650 
and also find it the most attractive so

00:02:21.650 --> 00:02:22.600 
and also find it the most attractive so
that's<00:02:21.830> kind<00:02:22.010> of<00:02:22.040> the<00:02:22.130> reason<00:02:22.340> why<00:02:22.430> we'll<00:02:22.580> be

00:02:22.600 --> 00:02:22.610 
that's kind of the reason why we'll be

00:02:22.610 --> 00:02:24.970 
that's kind of the reason why we'll be
using<00:02:22.819> that<00:02:23.090> one<00:02:23.380> you<00:02:24.380> can<00:02:24.530> see<00:02:24.680> we've<00:02:24.830> also

00:02:24.970 --> 00:02:24.980 
using that one you can see we've also

00:02:24.980 --> 00:02:27.550 
using that one you can see we've also
got<00:02:25.220> an<00:02:25.310> hourglass<00:02:25.819> shape<00:02:25.850> a<00:02:26.420> straight<00:02:27.260> taper

00:02:27.550 --> 00:02:27.560 
got an hourglass shape a straight taper

00:02:27.560 --> 00:02:31.720 
got an hourglass shape a straight taper
and<00:02:27.890> a<00:02:28.670> curved<00:02:28.880> without<00:02:29.180> a<00:02:29.209> taper<00:02:30.550> these<00:02:31.550> are

00:02:31.720 --> 00:02:31.730 
and a curved without a taper these are

00:02:31.730 --> 00:02:33.220 
and a curved without a taper these are
of<00:02:31.850> course<00:02:31.910> exaggerated<00:02:32.720> drawings<00:02:33.020> but<00:02:33.140> you

00:02:33.220 --> 00:02:33.230 
of course exaggerated drawings but you

00:02:33.230 --> 00:02:34.600 
of course exaggerated drawings but you
kind<00:02:33.410> of<00:02:33.470> get<00:02:33.590> the<00:02:33.680> idea<00:02:33.920> of<00:02:34.010> how<00:02:34.069> the<00:02:34.220> shape

00:02:34.600 --> 00:02:34.610 
kind of get the idea of how the shape

00:02:34.610 --> 00:02:40.309 
kind of get the idea of how the shape
might<00:02:34.819> differ

00:02:40.309 --> 00:02:40.319 

00:02:40.319 --> 00:02:42.050 

now<00:02:40.890> to<00:02:40.950> kind<00:02:41.219> of<00:02:41.250> come<00:02:41.459> to<00:02:41.610> some<00:02:41.790> of<00:02:41.879> the

00:02:42.050 --> 00:02:42.060 
now to kind of come to some of the

00:02:42.060 --> 00:02:43.910 
now to kind of come to some of the
dimensions<00:02:42.540> that<00:02:42.629> I've<00:02:42.780> been<00:02:42.900> using<00:02:43.140> and<00:02:43.530> how

00:02:43.910 --> 00:02:43.920 
dimensions that I've been using and how

00:02:43.920 --> 00:02:45.979 
dimensions that I've been using and how
I<00:02:43.950> might<00:02:44.129> get<00:02:44.370> to<00:02:44.430> them<00:02:44.670> especially<00:02:45.569> with<00:02:45.930> the

00:02:45.979 --> 00:02:45.989 
I might get to them especially with the

00:02:45.989 --> 00:02:48.440 
I might get to them especially with the
Edo<00:02:46.609> you're<00:02:47.609> going<00:02:47.730> to<00:02:47.790> need<00:02:47.909> to<00:02:48.000> know<00:02:48.030> three

00:02:48.440 --> 00:02:48.450 
Edo you're going to need to know three

00:02:48.450 --> 00:02:50.720 
Edo you're going to need to know three
things<00:02:48.480> about<00:02:48.840> your<00:02:49.140> Ito<00:02:49.379> first<00:02:50.370> is<00:02:50.579> the

00:02:50.720 --> 00:02:50.730 
things about your Ito first is the

00:02:50.730 --> 00:02:52.610 
things about your Ito first is the
height<00:02:50.909> of<00:02:50.939> it<00:02:51.299> which<00:02:51.930> is<00:02:52.079> going<00:02:52.230> to<00:02:52.290> determine

00:02:52.610 --> 00:02:52.620 
height of it which is going to determine

00:02:52.620 --> 00:02:55.819 
height of it which is going to determine
the<00:02:52.950> rappelled<00:02:53.579> isten<00:02:53.939> sub<00:02:54.150> your<00:02:54.299> sky<00:02:54.829> the

00:02:55.819 --> 00:02:55.829 
the rappelled isten sub your sky the

00:02:55.829 --> 00:02:57.349 
the rappelled isten sub your sky the
width<00:02:56.010> of<00:02:56.099> your<00:02:56.159> Edo<00:02:56.459> what<00:02:56.970> you're<00:02:57.090> going<00:02:57.269> to

00:02:57.349 --> 00:02:57.359 
width of your Edo what you're going to

00:02:57.359 --> 00:02:59.569 
width of your Edo what you're going to
need<00:02:57.510> for<00:02:57.750> your<00:02:57.840> Fuji<00:02:58.140> and<00:02:58.260> kashira<00:02:58.650> and<00:02:58.920> your

00:02:59.569 --> 00:02:59.579 
need for your Fuji and kashira and your

00:02:59.579 --> 00:03:01.160 
need for your Fuji and kashira and your
Ito<00:02:59.790> length<00:03:00.150> how<00:03:00.659> much<00:03:00.840> are<00:03:00.959> you<00:03:01.019> going<00:03:01.109> to

00:03:01.160 --> 00:03:01.170 
Ito length how much are you going to

00:03:01.170 --> 00:03:03.949 
Ito length how much are you going to
need<00:03:01.349> of<00:03:01.470> it<00:03:02.030> basically<00:03:03.030> the<00:03:03.450> height<00:03:03.629> and<00:03:03.870> the

00:03:03.949 --> 00:03:03.959 
need of it basically the height and the

00:03:03.959 --> 00:03:05.990 
need of it basically the height and the
width<00:03:04.140> are<00:03:04.650> determined<00:03:05.220> just<00:03:05.340> by<00:03:05.430> taking<00:03:05.760> a

00:03:05.990 --> 00:03:06.000 
width are determined just by taking a

00:03:06.000 --> 00:03:08.479 
width are determined just by taking a
piece<00:03:06.209> of<00:03:06.269> Edo<00:03:07.260> whatever<00:03:07.650> going<00:03:07.920> to<00:03:08.010> be<00:03:08.129> using

00:03:08.479 --> 00:03:08.489 
piece of Edo whatever going to be using

00:03:08.489 --> 00:03:10.580 
piece of Edo whatever going to be using
and<00:03:08.780> stretching<00:03:09.780> it<00:03:09.870> out<00:03:10.049> and<00:03:10.290> then<00:03:10.379> taking

00:03:10.580 --> 00:03:10.590 
and stretching it out and then taking

00:03:10.590 --> 00:03:12.740 
and stretching it out and then taking
the<00:03:10.829> measurements<00:03:11.280> it<00:03:11.909> has<00:03:12.090> to<00:03:12.299> be<00:03:12.389> stretched

00:03:12.740 --> 00:03:12.750 
the measurements it has to be stretched

00:03:12.750 --> 00:03:14.449 
the measurements it has to be stretched
because<00:03:13.109> that's<00:03:13.290> how<00:03:13.439> it's<00:03:13.620> going<00:03:13.799> to<00:03:13.889> be<00:03:14.129> on

00:03:14.449 --> 00:03:14.459 
because that's how it's going to be on

00:03:14.459 --> 00:03:16.970 
because that's how it's going to be on
the<00:03:14.879> sky<00:03:15.090> itself<00:03:15.450> so<00:03:16.409> if<00:03:16.500> you<00:03:16.590> don't<00:03:16.739> take<00:03:16.920> it

00:03:16.970 --> 00:03:16.980 
the sky itself so if you don't take it

00:03:16.980 --> 00:03:18.710 
the sky itself so if you don't take it
stretched<00:03:17.400> and<00:03:17.700> you<00:03:17.760> find<00:03:18.000> out<00:03:18.120> you<00:03:18.359> know<00:03:18.569> and

00:03:18.710 --> 00:03:18.720 
stretched and you find out you know and

00:03:18.720 --> 00:03:20.179 
stretched and you find out you know and
you<00:03:18.780> stretch<00:03:19.049> it<00:03:19.200> over<00:03:19.290> the<00:03:19.530> sky<00:03:19.769> as<00:03:19.980> we're

00:03:20.179 --> 00:03:20.189 
you stretch it over the sky as we're

00:03:20.189 --> 00:03:22.009 
you stretch it over the sky as we're
wrapping<00:03:20.340> it<00:03:20.700> the<00:03:21.269> measurements<00:03:21.689> gonna<00:03:21.840> be

00:03:22.009 --> 00:03:22.019 
wrapping it the measurements gonna be

00:03:22.019 --> 00:03:24.199 
wrapping it the measurements gonna be
off<00:03:22.519> so<00:03:23.519> make<00:03:23.669> sure<00:03:23.700> you<00:03:23.939> take<00:03:24.180> your

00:03:24.199 --> 00:03:24.209 
off so make sure you take your

00:03:24.209 --> 00:03:25.879 
off so make sure you take your
measurements<00:03:24.780> stretched<00:03:25.049> because<00:03:25.709> that's

00:03:25.879 --> 00:03:25.889 
measurements stretched because that's

00:03:25.889 --> 00:03:29.479 
measurements stretched because that's
the<00:03:25.980> way<00:03:26.040> it's<00:03:26.159> going<00:03:26.280> to<00:03:26.370> be<00:03:26.430> on<00:03:26.579> your<00:03:26.700> sky<00:03:28.489> now

00:03:29.479 --> 00:03:29.489 
the way it's going to be on your sky now

00:03:29.489 --> 00:03:31.699 
the way it's going to be on your sky now
to<00:03:29.549> determine<00:03:29.790> how<00:03:30.180> long<00:03:30.260> how<00:03:31.260> much<00:03:31.439> Ito

00:03:31.699 --> 00:03:31.709 
to determine how long how much Ito

00:03:31.709 --> 00:03:33.470 
to determine how long how much Ito
you're<00:03:31.889> going<00:03:32.099> to<00:03:32.280> need<00:03:32.459> you<00:03:33.060> need<00:03:33.209> to<00:03:33.299> note<00:03:33.450> a

00:03:33.470 --> 00:03:33.480 
you're going to need you need to note a

00:03:33.480 --> 00:03:35.569 
you're going to need you need to note a
couple<00:03:33.930> things<00:03:34.230> you<00:03:34.739> need<00:03:34.889> to<00:03:34.919> know<00:03:35.069> is<00:03:35.430> the

00:03:35.569 --> 00:03:35.579 
couple things you need to know is the

00:03:35.579 --> 00:03:38.420 
couple things you need to know is the
sky<00:03:35.939> length<00:03:36.650> basically<00:03:37.650> how<00:03:37.769> much<00:03:37.950> you're

00:03:38.420 --> 00:03:38.430 
sky length basically how much you're

00:03:38.430 --> 00:03:40.940 
sky length basically how much you're
going<00:03:38.669> to<00:03:38.760> be<00:03:38.879> wrapping<00:03:39.180> and<00:03:39.590> then<00:03:40.590> you're

00:03:40.940 --> 00:03:40.950 
going to be wrapping and then you're

00:03:40.950 --> 00:03:42.349 
going to be wrapping and then you're
also<00:03:41.099> going<00:03:41.250> to<00:03:41.310> need<00:03:41.519> to<00:03:41.700> know<00:03:41.730> the<00:03:41.879> overall

00:03:42.349 --> 00:03:42.359 
also going to need to know the overall

00:03:42.359 --> 00:03:46.309 
also going to need to know the overall
handle<00:03:42.930> length<00:03:43.819> the<00:03:44.819> first<00:03:45.090> the<00:03:45.750> sky<00:03:46.019> length

00:03:46.309 --> 00:03:46.319 
handle length the first the sky length

00:03:46.319 --> 00:03:49.640 
handle length the first the sky length
is<00:03:47.569> essentially<00:03:48.569> the<00:03:48.870> length<00:03:49.049> of<00:03:49.290> that<00:03:49.409> is

00:03:49.640 --> 00:03:49.650 
is essentially the length of that is

00:03:49.650 --> 00:03:52.099 
is essentially the length of that is
going<00:03:50.040> to<00:03:50.159> be<00:03:50.310> the<00:03:50.459> half<00:03:50.639> inch<00:03:50.970> of<00:03:51.269> material

00:03:52.099 --> 00:03:52.109 
going to be the half inch of material

00:03:52.109 --> 00:03:53.930 
going to be the half inch of material
that<00:03:52.739> is<00:03:52.799> going<00:03:52.829> to<00:03:53.040> be<00:03:53.099> recessed<00:03:53.549> into<00:03:53.790> the

00:03:53.930 --> 00:03:53.940 
that is going to be recessed into the

00:03:53.940 --> 00:03:57.469 
that is going to be recessed into the
Gucci<00:03:54.900> and<00:03:55.019> tashera<00:03:55.760> plus<00:03:56.760> the<00:03:56.940> rappelled

00:03:57.469 --> 00:03:57.479 
Gucci and tashera plus the rappelled

00:03:57.479 --> 00:04:00.250 
Gucci and tashera plus the rappelled
isten<00:03:57.840> s'<00:03:57.870> now<00:03:58.650> the<00:03:58.709> Rapa<00:03:58.979> bol<00:03:59.250> distance<00:03:59.669> is

00:04:00.250 --> 00:04:00.260 
isten s' now the Rapa bol distance is

00:04:00.260 --> 00:04:02.930 
isten s' now the Rapa bol distance is
relying<00:04:01.260> on<00:04:01.409> two<00:04:01.680> variables<00:04:02.280> the<00:04:02.699> first

00:04:02.930 --> 00:04:02.940 
relying on two variables the first

00:04:02.940 --> 00:04:05.719 
relying on two variables the first
variable<00:04:03.269> is<00:04:03.510> that<00:04:03.780> X<00:04:04.199> has<00:04:05.099> to<00:04:05.310> be<00:04:05.400> an<00:04:05.489> odd

00:04:05.719 --> 00:04:05.729 
variable is that X has to be an odd

00:04:05.729 --> 00:04:09.170 
variable is that X has to be an odd
number<00:04:06.109> that's<00:04:07.109> just<00:04:07.409> a<00:04:07.530> caveat<00:04:08.180> it's

00:04:09.170 --> 00:04:09.180 
number that's just a caveat it's

00:04:09.180 --> 00:04:11.449 
number that's just a caveat it's
dependent<00:04:10.049> on<00:04:10.139> the<00:04:10.290> way<00:04:10.440> we<00:04:10.620> wrap<00:04:10.859> the<00:04:11.069> handle

00:04:11.449 --> 00:04:11.459 
dependent on the way we wrap the handle

00:04:11.459 --> 00:04:14.479 
dependent on the way we wrap the handle
so<00:04:12.299> that<00:04:12.720> is<00:04:12.930> kind<00:04:13.109> of<00:04:13.139> a<00:04:13.260> given<00:04:13.590> just<00:04:14.250> have<00:04:14.370> to

00:04:14.479 --> 00:04:14.489 
so that is kind of a given just have to

00:04:14.489 --> 00:04:16.009 
so that is kind of a given just have to
make<00:04:14.639> sure<00:04:14.669> that<00:04:14.849> this<00:04:15.239> overall<00:04:15.599> length

00:04:16.009 --> 00:04:16.019 
make sure that this overall length

00:04:16.019 --> 00:04:18.680 
make sure that this overall length
covers<00:04:16.560> the<00:04:16.709> tang<00:04:16.979> and<00:04:17.280> the<00:04:17.880> X<00:04:18.150> in<00:04:18.510> this<00:04:18.630> case

00:04:18.680 --> 00:04:18.690 
covers the tang and the X in this case

00:04:18.690 --> 00:04:20.899 
covers the tang and the X in this case
must<00:04:19.320> be<00:04:19.560> odd<00:04:19.829> so<00:04:20.310> in<00:04:20.400> this<00:04:20.489> case<00:04:20.669> it's<00:04:20.820> going

00:04:20.899 --> 00:04:20.909 
must be odd so in this case it's going

00:04:20.909 --> 00:04:24.740 
must be odd so in this case it's going
to<00:04:20.970> be<00:04:21.030> 37<00:04:21.919> the<00:04:22.919> height<00:04:23.099> of<00:04:23.310> your<00:04:23.460> Ito<00:04:23.669> is<00:04:24.479> going

00:04:24.740 --> 00:04:24.750 
to be 37 the height of your Ito is going

00:04:24.750 --> 00:04:27.409 
to be 37 the height of your Ito is going
to<00:04:24.840> be<00:04:24.930> put<00:04:25.199> in<00:04:25.320> for<00:04:25.500> H<00:04:25.710> and<00:04:26.070> in<00:04:26.849> this<00:04:26.970> case<00:04:27.240> I'm

00:04:27.409 --> 00:04:27.419 
to be put in for H and in this case I'm

00:04:27.419 --> 00:04:29.719 
to be put in for H and in this case I'm
using<00:04:27.449> quarter-inch<00:04:28.349> I<00:04:28.650> use<00:04:28.889> a<00:04:29.010> bias<00:04:29.370> tape

00:04:29.719 --> 00:04:29.729 
using quarter-inch I use a bias tape

00:04:29.729 --> 00:04:32.330 
using quarter-inch I use a bias tape
instead<00:04:30.060> of<00:04:30.240> like<00:04:30.360> an<00:04:30.449> actual<00:04:31.070> silk<00:04:32.070> or<00:04:32.220> cotton

00:04:32.330 --> 00:04:32.340 
instead of like an actual silk or cotton

00:04:32.340 --> 00:04:35.060 
instead of like an actual silk or cotton
Ito<00:04:32.729> and<00:04:33.120> it<00:04:33.630> works<00:04:33.780> quite<00:04:34.020> well<00:04:34.050> for<00:04:34.229> me<00:04:34.530> but

00:04:35.060 --> 00:04:35.070 
Ito and it works quite well for me but

00:04:35.070 --> 00:04:37.430 
Ito and it works quite well for me but
the<00:04:35.220> stretched<00:04:35.520> pipe<00:04:36.270> is<00:04:36.509> a<00:04:36.630> quarter<00:04:37.169> of<00:04:37.320> an

00:04:37.430 --> 00:04:37.440 
the stretched pipe is a quarter of an

00:04:37.440 --> 00:04:39.050 
the stretched pipe is a quarter of an
inch<00:04:37.620> and<00:04:37.919> so<00:04:38.250> that's<00:04:38.430> what<00:04:38.580> I'm<00:04:38.669> using<00:04:38.699> for

00:04:39.050 --> 00:04:39.060 
inch and so that's what I'm using for

00:04:39.060 --> 00:04:41.510 
inch and so that's what I'm using for
these<00:04:39.300> equations<00:04:39.590> so<00:04:40.590> the<00:04:40.680> raffle<00:04:41.130> distance

00:04:41.510 --> 00:04:41.520 
these equations so the raffle distance

00:04:41.520 --> 00:04:47.409 
these equations so the raffle distance
is<00:04:41.720> going<00:04:42.720> to<00:04:42.870> be<00:04:43.550> 37<00:04:44.550> times<00:04:44.970> 1/4

00:04:47.409 --> 00:04:47.419 
is going to be 37 times 1/4

00:04:47.419 --> 00:04:49.520 
is going to be 37 times 1/4
so<00:04:48.419> as<00:04:48.539> you<00:04:48.629> can<00:04:48.750> see<00:04:48.810> further<00:04:49.169> on<00:04:49.410> in<00:04:49.500> the

00:04:49.520 --> 00:04:49.530 
so as you can see further on in the

00:04:49.530 --> 00:04:51.170 
so as you can see further on in the
equation<00:04:50.009> the<00:04:50.160> length<00:04:50.430> for<00:04:50.669> me<00:04:50.789> is<00:04:50.910> going<00:04:51.090> to

00:04:51.170 --> 00:04:51.180 
equation the length for me is going to

00:04:51.180 --> 00:04:54.379 
equation the length for me is going to
be<00:04:51.270> 1/2<00:04:51.629> inch<00:04:51.900> plus<00:04:52.410> 37<00:04:53.099> times<00:04:53.310> 1/4<00:04:54.000> inch

00:04:54.379 --> 00:04:54.389 
be 1/2 inch plus 37 times 1/4 inch

00:04:54.389 --> 00:05:00.710 
be 1/2 inch plus 37 times 1/4 inch
equals<00:04:56.599> 9<00:04:57.599> and<00:04:57.629> 1/4<00:04:58.409> inch<00:04:59.300> you<00:05:00.300> can<00:05:00.449> see<00:05:00.569> all<00:05:00.690> I

00:05:00.710 --> 00:05:00.720 
equals 9 and 1/4 inch you can see all I

00:05:00.720 --> 00:05:02.659 
equals 9 and 1/4 inch you can see all I
did<00:05:00.930> was<00:05:01.080> I<00:05:01.199> just<00:05:01.259> simplified<00:05:01.830> the<00:05:02.159> equation

00:05:02.659 --> 00:05:02.669 
did was I just simplified the equation

00:05:02.669 --> 00:05:05.779 
did was I just simplified the equation
here<00:05:03.229> so<00:05:04.229> my<00:05:04.440> actual<00:05:05.039> SKA<00:05:05.430> that<00:05:05.669> i'll<00:05:05.759> be

00:05:05.779 --> 00:05:05.789 
here so my actual SKA that i'll be

00:05:05.789 --> 00:05:08.119 
here so my actual SKA that i'll be
carving<00:05:06.270> is<00:05:06.449> nine<00:05:06.990> and<00:05:07.020> one<00:05:07.470> quarters<00:05:07.889> inch

00:05:08.119 --> 00:05:08.129 
carving is nine and one quarters inch

00:05:08.129 --> 00:05:12.409 
carving is nine and one quarters inch
long<00:05:08.879> so<00:05:10.190> how<00:05:11.190> do<00:05:11.250> I<00:05:11.370> take<00:05:11.610> that<00:05:11.639> and<00:05:12.090> find<00:05:12.300> out

00:05:12.409 --> 00:05:12.419 
long so how do I take that and find out

00:05:12.419 --> 00:05:15.260 
long so how do I take that and find out
how<00:05:12.539> much<00:05:12.659> IDO<00:05:13.050> I<00:05:13.080> need<00:05:13.819> well<00:05:14.819> basically<00:05:15.030> you

00:05:15.260 --> 00:05:15.270 
how much IDO I need well basically you

00:05:15.270 --> 00:05:17.029 
how much IDO I need well basically you
take<00:05:15.389> the<00:05:15.449> overall<00:05:15.870> length<00:05:16.139> of<00:05:16.379> the<00:05:16.500> handle

00:05:17.029 --> 00:05:17.039 
take the overall length of the handle

00:05:17.039 --> 00:05:19.490 
take the overall length of the handle
and<00:05:17.159> add<00:05:17.909> 2<00:05:18.330> to<00:05:18.539> it<00:05:18.569> and<00:05:18.840> that<00:05:19.169> will<00:05:19.259> give<00:05:19.380> you

00:05:19.490 --> 00:05:19.500 
and add 2 to it and that will give you

00:05:19.500 --> 00:05:24.610 
and add 2 to it and that will give you
the<00:05:19.650> length<00:05:19.830> and<00:05:20.220> feet<00:05:22.280> so<00:05:23.280> the<00:05:23.430> sky<00:05:23.669> length

00:05:24.610 --> 00:05:24.620 
the length and feet so the sky length

00:05:24.620 --> 00:05:28.480 
the length and feet so the sky length
plus<00:05:25.620> 1/2<00:05:26.130> that<00:05:27.060> is<00:05:27.120> the<00:05:27.569> sky<00:05:27.780> length<00:05:28.080> plus<00:05:28.409> the

00:05:28.480 --> 00:05:28.490 
plus 1/2 that is the sky length plus the

00:05:28.490 --> 00:05:31.249 
plus 1/2 that is the sky length plus the
1/2<00:05:29.490> inch<00:05:29.789> that<00:05:30.000> you've<00:05:30.210> had<00:05:30.479> recessed<00:05:31.020> into

00:05:31.249 --> 00:05:31.259 
1/2 inch that you've had recessed into

00:05:31.259 --> 00:05:33.920 
1/2 inch that you've had recessed into
the<00:05:31.470> food<00:05:31.590> chain<00:05:31.650> kashira<00:05:32.280> plus<00:05:32.970> the<00:05:33.150> 1/2<00:05:33.569> inch

00:05:33.920 --> 00:05:33.930 
the food chain kashira plus the 1/2 inch

00:05:33.930 --> 00:05:35.899 
the food chain kashira plus the 1/2 inch
that's<00:05:34.259> added<00:05:34.650> on<00:05:34.740> for<00:05:34.800> the<00:05:35.069> Fuji<00:05:35.370> and<00:05:35.430> kashira

00:05:35.899 --> 00:05:35.909 
that's added on for the Fuji and kashira

00:05:35.909 --> 00:05:39.830 
that's added on for the Fuji and kashira
that's<00:05:36.210> not<00:05:36.389> recessed<00:05:37.069> plus<00:05:38.069> 2<00:05:38.449> so<00:05:39.449> the<00:05:39.630> sky

00:05:39.830 --> 00:05:39.840 
that's not recessed plus 2 so the sky

00:05:39.840 --> 00:05:42.379 
that's not recessed plus 2 so the sky
length<00:05:40.139> is<00:05:40.319> 9<00:05:41.159> and<00:05:41.310> 1/4<00:05:41.699> as<00:05:41.849> we<00:05:41.969> found<00:05:42.180> up<00:05:42.360> here

00:05:42.379 --> 00:05:42.389 
length is 9 and 1/4 as we found up here

00:05:42.389 --> 00:05:45.070 
length is 9 and 1/4 as we found up here
and<00:05:42.780> then<00:05:43.710> that<00:05:43.860> 1/2<00:05:44.039> inch<00:05:44.280> is<00:05:44.400> just<00:05:44.580> added<00:05:44.879> in

00:05:45.070 --> 00:05:45.080 
and then that 1/2 inch is just added in

00:05:45.080 --> 00:05:47.809 
and then that 1/2 inch is just added in
and<00:05:46.080> you<00:05:46.199> add<00:05:46.349> 2<00:05:46.590> to<00:05:46.770> it<00:05:46.800> and<00:05:47.099> this<00:05:47.400> gives<00:05:47.669> you

00:05:47.809 --> 00:05:47.819 
and you add 2 to it and this gives you

00:05:47.819 --> 00:05:49.999 
and you add 2 to it and this gives you
like<00:05:48.000> I<00:05:48.120> said<00:05:48.180> the<00:05:49.080> amount<00:05:49.259> of<00:05:49.319> Ito<00:05:49.590> you<00:05:49.740> need

00:05:49.999 --> 00:05:50.009 
like I said the amount of Ito you need

00:05:50.009 --> 00:05:53.390 
like I said the amount of Ito you need
in<00:05:50.190> feet<00:05:50.960> which<00:05:51.960> is<00:05:51.990> 11<00:05:52.440> and<00:05:52.590> 3/4

00:05:53.390 --> 00:05:53.400 
in feet which is 11 and 3/4

00:05:53.400 --> 00:05:55.490 
in feet which is 11 and 3/4
now<00:05:53.639> I've<00:05:53.819> just<00:05:53.849> rounded<00:05:54.330> that<00:05:54.449> up<00:05:54.630> to<00:05:55.380> be

00:05:55.490 --> 00:05:55.500 
now I've just rounded that up to be

00:05:55.500 --> 00:06:00.110 
now I've just rounded that up to be
between<00:05:55.949> 12<00:05:56.400> and<00:05:56.580> 13<00:05:56.699> feet<00:05:58.729> that<00:05:59.729> kind<00:06:00.090> of

00:06:00.110 --> 00:06:00.120 
between 12 and 13 feet that kind of

00:06:00.120 --> 00:06:02.719 
between 12 and 13 feet that kind of
gives<00:06:00.270> you<00:06:00.330> a<00:06:00.389> little<00:06:00.419> bit<00:06:00.630> of<00:06:00.780> extra<00:06:01.229> and<00:06:02.219> also

00:06:02.719 --> 00:06:02.729 
gives you a little bit of extra and also

00:06:02.729 --> 00:06:04.550 
gives you a little bit of extra and also
gives<00:06:03.060> you<00:06:03.270> you<00:06:03.690> know<00:06:03.719> make<00:06:03.990> sure<00:06:04.020> you<00:06:04.289> have

00:06:04.550 --> 00:06:04.560 
gives you you know make sure you have

00:06:04.560 --> 00:06:06.320 
gives you you know make sure you have
enough<00:06:04.889> and<00:06:05.159> you<00:06:05.250> don't<00:06:05.430> find<00:06:05.819> out<00:06:06.000> that<00:06:06.150> your

00:06:06.320 --> 00:06:06.330 
enough and you don't find out that your

00:06:06.330 --> 00:06:07.850 
enough and you don't find out that your
short<00:06:06.690> after<00:06:06.960> you've<00:06:07.110> wrapped<00:06:07.349> your<00:06:07.500> handle

00:06:07.850 --> 00:06:07.860 
short after you've wrapped your handle

00:06:07.860 --> 00:06:09.950 
short after you've wrapped your handle
and<00:06:07.919> you<00:06:08.039> know<00:06:08.400> you're<00:06:08.940> short<00:06:09.270> by<00:06:09.419> an<00:06:09.539> inch<00:06:09.750> and

00:06:09.950 --> 00:06:09.960 
and you know you're short by an inch and

00:06:09.960 --> 00:06:12.610 
and you know you're short by an inch and
you're<00:06:10.050> like<00:06:10.460> now<00:06:11.460> where<00:06:11.699> am<00:06:11.819> I<00:06:11.880> going<00:06:12.029> to<00:06:12.120> be

00:06:12.610 --> 00:06:12.620 
you're like now where am I going to be

00:06:12.620 --> 00:06:15.860 
you're like now where am I going to be
so<00:06:13.620> just<00:06:13.889> make<00:06:14.039> sure<00:06:14.069> for<00:06:14.400> this<00:06:14.639> if<00:06:14.969> you're

00:06:15.860 --> 00:06:15.870 
so just make sure for this if you're

00:06:15.870 --> 00:06:20.269 
so just make sure for this if you're
using<00:06:16.080> quarter-inch<00:06:16.710> Ito<00:06:17.009> as<00:06:17.840> I<00:06:18.840> am<00:06:19.099> you<00:06:20.099> need

00:06:20.269 --> 00:06:20.279 
using quarter-inch Ito as I am you need

00:06:20.279 --> 00:06:23.089 
using quarter-inch Ito as I am you need
about<00:06:20.520> 12<00:06:20.819> to<00:06:21.000> 13<00:06:21.029> now<00:06:21.659> you<00:06:22.380> should<00:06:22.650> be<00:06:22.800> able<00:06:22.919> to

00:06:23.089 --> 00:06:23.099 
about 12 to 13 now you should be able to

00:06:23.099 --> 00:06:25.899 
about 12 to 13 now you should be able to
use<00:06:23.279> 12<00:06:23.610> to<00:06:23.729> 13<00:06:24.120> feet<00:06:24.569> of<00:06:24.840> Ito<00:06:25.080> for<00:06:25.440> whatever

00:06:25.899 --> 00:06:25.909 
use 12 to 13 feet of Ito for whatever

00:06:25.909 --> 00:06:27.980 
use 12 to 13 feet of Ito for whatever
actual<00:06:26.909> heights<00:06:27.120> of<00:06:27.270> Ito<00:06:27.479> you're<00:06:27.719> using

00:06:27.980 --> 00:06:27.990 
actual heights of Ito you're using

00:06:27.990 --> 00:06:30.649 
actual heights of Ito you're using
because<00:06:28.919> this<00:06:29.279> equation<00:06:29.430> is<00:06:29.849> based<00:06:30.120> roughly

00:06:30.649 --> 00:06:30.659 
because this equation is based roughly

00:06:30.659 --> 00:06:35.870 
because this equation is based roughly
on<00:06:30.810> any<00:06:31.620> range<00:06:32.250> between<00:06:32.750> 3/16<00:06:33.750> to<00:06:33.900> 5/16<00:06:34.860> so<00:06:35.819> you

00:06:35.870 --> 00:06:35.880 
on any range between 3/16 to 5/16 so you

00:06:35.880 --> 00:06:38.420 
on any range between 3/16 to 5/16 so you
should<00:06:36.120> be<00:06:36.210> able<00:06:36.300> to<00:06:36.419> by<00:06:36.630> 12<00:06:37.169> to<00:06:37.319> 13<00:06:37.710> feet<00:06:38.130> of

00:06:38.420 --> 00:06:38.430 
should be able to by 12 to 13 feet of

00:06:38.430 --> 00:06:40.129 
should be able to by 12 to 13 feet of
whatever<00:06:38.759> ito<00:06:39.120> you're<00:06:39.330> going<00:06:39.479> to<00:06:39.630> be<00:06:39.750> using

00:06:40.129 --> 00:06:40.139 
whatever ito you're going to be using

00:06:40.139 --> 00:06:42.499 
whatever ito you're going to be using
for<00:06:40.319> the<00:06:41.069> project<00:06:41.520> as<00:06:41.639> long<00:06:41.789> as<00:06:41.940> your<00:06:42.060> handle

00:06:42.499 --> 00:06:42.509 
for the project as long as your handle

00:06:42.509 --> 00:06:46.010 
for the project as long as your handle
isn't<00:06:42.960> going<00:06:43.169> to<00:06:43.229> be<00:06:43.349> much<00:06:43.500> bigger<00:06:44.449> than<00:06:45.449> this

00:06:46.010 --> 00:06:46.020 
isn't going to be much bigger than this

00:06:46.020 --> 00:06:49.790 
isn't going to be much bigger than this
9<00:06:46.469> and<00:06:46.680> 1/4

00:06:49.790 --> 00:06:49.800 

00:06:49.800 --> 00:06:52.590 

so<00:06:50.800> now<00:06:51.040> if<00:06:51.400> you<00:06:51.520> are<00:06:51.670> using<00:06:51.820> a<00:06:52.210> different<00:06:52.510> than

00:06:52.590 --> 00:06:52.600 
so now if you are using a different than

00:06:52.600 --> 00:06:55.590 
so now if you are using a different than
1/4<00:06:53.110> inch<00:06:53.230> Ito<00:06:53.530> you<00:06:53.890> just<00:06:54.280> sub<00:06:55.090> it<00:06:55.120> in<00:06:55.300> for<00:06:55.480> this

00:06:55.590 --> 00:06:55.600 
1/4 inch Ito you just sub it in for this

00:06:55.600 --> 00:06:57.660 
1/4 inch Ito you just sub it in for this
equation<00:06:55.930> so<00:06:56.470> instead<00:06:56.770> of<00:06:56.830> Ito<00:06:57.190> heights<00:06:57.490> of

00:06:57.660 --> 00:06:57.670 
equation so instead of Ito heights of

00:06:57.670 --> 00:07:01.770 
equation so instead of Ito heights of
being<00:06:57.850> 1/4<00:06:58.360> for<00:06:58.630> H<00:06:58.810> you<00:06:59.140> use<00:06:59.860> 3/16<00:07:00.670> s<00:07:00.790> or<00:07:00.910> 5/16

00:07:01.770 --> 00:07:01.780 
being 1/4 for H you use 3/16 s or 5/16

00:07:01.780 --> 00:07:05.360 
being 1/4 for H you use 3/16 s or 5/16
plug<00:07:02.440> that<00:07:02.620> in<00:07:02.890> just<00:07:03.520> make<00:07:03.700> sure<00:07:03.940> that<00:07:03.970> this<00:07:04.270> 37

00:07:05.360 --> 00:07:05.370 
plug that in just make sure that this 37

00:07:05.370 --> 00:07:07.860 
plug that in just make sure that this 37
doesn't<00:07:06.370> have<00:07:06.490> to<00:07:06.670> be<00:07:06.760> 37<00:07:07.360> but<00:07:07.480> it<00:07:07.570> does<00:07:07.690> have

00:07:07.860 --> 00:07:07.870 
doesn't have to be 37 but it does have

00:07:07.870 --> 00:07:10.770 
doesn't have to be 37 but it does have
to<00:07:08.020> be<00:07:08.050> odd<00:07:08.320> so<00:07:09.160> X<00:07:09.370> has<00:07:09.580> to<00:07:09.790> be<00:07:09.820> odd<00:07:10.090> and<00:07:10.360> as<00:07:10.600> long

00:07:10.770 --> 00:07:10.780 
to be odd so X has to be odd and as long

00:07:10.780 --> 00:07:13.920 
to be odd so X has to be odd and as long
as<00:07:10.960> this<00:07:11.170> right<00:07:11.530> here<00:07:11.800> X<00:07:11.980> times<00:07:12.490> H<00:07:12.820> as<00:07:13.600> long<00:07:13.810> as

00:07:13.920 --> 00:07:13.930 
as this right here X times H as long as

00:07:13.930 --> 00:07:15.960 
as this right here X times H as long as
that<00:07:14.110> covers<00:07:14.950> your<00:07:15.130> tank<00:07:15.460> as<00:07:15.670> long<00:07:15.790> as<00:07:15.880> that's

00:07:15.960 --> 00:07:15.970 
that covers your tank as long as that's

00:07:15.970 --> 00:07:17.310 
that covers your tank as long as that's
long<00:07:16.120> enough<00:07:16.150> to<00:07:16.420> cover<00:07:16.570> your<00:07:16.720> tank<00:07:16.990> you're

00:07:17.310 --> 00:07:17.320 
long enough to cover your tank you're

00:07:17.320 --> 00:07:20.520 
long enough to cover your tank you're
all<00:07:17.470> set<00:07:18.390> and<00:07:19.390> then<00:07:19.600> you<00:07:19.720> just<00:07:19.900> plug<00:07:20.170> that<00:07:20.200> in

00:07:20.520 --> 00:07:20.530 
all set and then you just plug that in

00:07:20.530 --> 00:07:22.080 
all set and then you just plug that in
like<00:07:20.680> I<00:07:20.770> said<00:07:20.800> instead<00:07:21.280> of<00:07:21.340> quarter-inch<00:07:21.730> here

00:07:22.080 --> 00:07:22.090 
like I said instead of quarter-inch here

00:07:22.090 --> 00:07:25.500 
like I said instead of quarter-inch here
you'd<00:07:22.390> plug<00:07:22.600> in<00:07:22.890> 3/16<00:07:23.890> or<00:07:24.010> 5/16<00:07:24.760> somewhere<00:07:25.420> in

00:07:25.500 --> 00:07:25.510 
you'd plug in 3/16 or 5/16 somewhere in

00:07:25.510 --> 00:07:28.110 
you'd plug in 3/16 or 5/16 somewhere in
that<00:07:25.570> range<00:07:25.900> and<00:07:26.280> keep<00:07:27.280> just<00:07:27.520> following<00:07:27.970> these

00:07:28.110 --> 00:07:28.120 
that range and keep just following these

00:07:28.120 --> 00:07:32.670 
that range and keep just following these
equations<00:07:28.840> here<00:07:29.170> and<00:07:30.780> again<00:07:31.780> like<00:07:31.990> I<00:07:32.110> said<00:07:32.170> you

00:07:32.670 --> 00:07:32.680 
equations here and again like I said you

00:07:32.680 --> 00:07:35.040 
equations here and again like I said you
should<00:07:32.920> be<00:07:33.250> able<00:07:33.520> to<00:07:33.610> buy<00:07:33.940> between<00:07:34.570> 12<00:07:34.870> and<00:07:34.930> 13

00:07:35.040 --> 00:07:35.050 
should be able to buy between 12 and 13

00:07:35.050 --> 00:07:37.380 
should be able to buy between 12 and 13
feet<00:07:35.590> of<00:07:35.770> Ito<00:07:36.010> to<00:07:36.250> cover<00:07:36.490> it<00:07:36.640> if<00:07:37.240> you're

00:07:37.380 --> 00:07:37.390 
feet of Ito to cover it if you're

00:07:37.390 --> 00:07:41.430 
feet of Ito to cover it if you're
nervous<00:07:37.600> go<00:07:37.930> for<00:07:38.140> 13<00:07:38.500> or<00:07:38.650> 14<00:07:40.050> then<00:07:41.050> that<00:07:41.260> should

00:07:41.430 --> 00:07:41.440 
nervous go for 13 or 14 then that should

00:07:41.440 --> 00:07:44.610 
nervous go for 13 or 14 then that should
cover<00:07:41.620> you<00:07:42.570> that<00:07:43.570> basically<00:07:43.750> covers<00:07:44.110> it<00:07:44.440> and

00:07:44.610 --> 00:07:44.620 
cover you that basically covers it and

00:07:44.620 --> 00:07:46.350 
cover you that basically covers it and
like<00:07:45.160> I<00:07:45.280> said<00:07:45.340> you<00:07:45.670> need<00:07:45.820> to<00:07:45.910> know<00:07:46.030> your<00:07:46.180> height

00:07:46.350 --> 00:07:46.360 
like I said you need to know your height

00:07:46.360 --> 00:07:48.830 
like I said you need to know your height
your<00:07:46.660> within<00:07:46.900> your<00:07:47.140> length<00:07:47.410> of<00:07:47.590> the<00:07:47.770> ITO<00:07:48.040> and

00:07:48.830 --> 00:07:48.840 
your within your length of the ITO and

00:07:48.840 --> 00:07:51.060 
your within your length of the ITO and
then<00:07:49.840> you<00:07:49.930> should<00:07:50.110> be<00:07:50.230> all<00:07:50.350> set<00:07:50.560> to<00:07:50.710> cover<00:07:50.920> the

00:07:51.060 --> 00:07:51.070 
then you should be all set to cover the

00:07:51.070 --> 00:07:54.120 
then you should be all set to cover the
next<00:07:51.280> pieces<00:07:52.170> now<00:07:53.170> like<00:07:53.320> I<00:07:53.440> said<00:07:53.680> these<00:07:53.860> do

00:07:54.120 --> 00:07:54.130 
next pieces now like I said these do

00:07:54.130 --> 00:07:55.710 
next pieces now like I said these do
inter<00:07:54.460> relate<00:07:54.700> a<00:07:54.790> little<00:07:54.880> bit<00:07:55.150> I<00:07:55.270> hope<00:07:55.510> this

00:07:55.710 --> 00:07:55.720 
inter relate a little bit I hope this

00:07:55.720 --> 00:07:58.860 
inter relate a little bit I hope this
explained<00:07:56.490> how<00:07:57.490> that<00:07:57.730> does<00:07:58.120> you<00:07:58.600> know<00:07:58.690> how

they align with each other and how the

00:08:00.490 --> 00:08:02.730 
they align with each other and how the
pieces<00:08:00.790> are<00:08:01.030> going<00:08:01.120> to<00:08:01.180> go<00:08:01.240> together<00:08:01.740> I'll

00:08:02.730 --> 00:08:02.740 
pieces are going to go together I'll

00:08:02.740 --> 00:08:04.560 
pieces are going to go together I'll
explain<00:08:03.130> a<00:08:03.190> little<00:08:03.310> bit<00:08:03.550> more<00:08:03.610> detail<00:08:04.240> per
