this<00:00:33.180> isn't<00:00:33.360> doing<00:00:33.540> anything<00:00:33.899> I<00:00:34.260> thought<00:00:34.620> that

00:00:34.760 --> 00:00:34.770 
this isn't doing anything I thought that

00:00:34.770 --> 00:00:36.889 
this isn't doing anything I thought that
was<00:00:34.890> an<00:00:35.160> enemy<00:00:35.520> but<00:00:35.760> a<00:00:35.790> little<00:00:36.510> bit<00:00:36.630> of<00:00:36.690> a<00:00:36.719> pill

00:00:36.889 --> 00:00:36.899 
was an enemy but a little bit of a pill

00:00:36.899 --> 00:00:39.139 
was an enemy but a little bit of a pill
there<00:00:37.140> I<00:00:37.320> get<00:00:37.770> up<00:00:37.890> my<00:00:38.010> smoke<00:00:38.370> grenade<00:00:38.700> and<00:00:38.910> my

00:00:39.139 --> 00:00:39.149 
there I get up my smoke grenade and my

00:00:39.149 --> 00:00:40.940 
there I get up my smoke grenade and my
plan<00:00:39.420> here<00:00:39.719> is<00:00:39.750> kind<00:00:40.110> of<00:00:40.200> like<00:00:40.290> a<00:00:40.350> tactical

00:00:40.940 --> 00:00:40.950 
plan here is kind of like a tactical

00:00:40.950 --> 00:00:43.040 
plan here is kind of like a tactical
approach<00:00:41.280> though<00:00:41.550> the<00:00:41.700> smoke<00:00:41.910> grenade<00:00:42.210> having

00:00:43.040 --> 00:00:43.050 
approach though the smoke grenade having

somebody you'll see I sneak up he gets
down<00:00:56.579> and<00:00:57.030> then<00:00:57.180> I<00:00:57.210> try<00:00:57.510> and<00:00:57.780> move<00:00:57.870> on<00:00:58.050> to<00:00:58.079> the

00:00:58.279 --> 00:00:58.289 
down and then I try and move on to the

00:00:58.289 --> 00:01:00.470 
down and then I try and move on to the
next<00:00:58.320> guy<00:00:58.649> and<00:00:58.920> by<00:00:59.280> the<00:00:59.309> time<00:00:59.460> that<00:00:59.730> i<00:00:59.969> bring<00:01:00.270> my

00:01:00.470 --> 00:01:00.480 
next guy and by the time that i bring my

00:01:00.480 --> 00:01:03.080 
next guy and by the time that i bring my
aim<00:01:00.690> back<00:01:01.230> he<00:01:01.920> already<00:01:02.129> revived<00:01:02.579> the<00:01:02.699> last<00:01:02.879> guy

00:01:03.080 --> 00:01:03.090 
aim back he already revived the last guy

00:01:03.090 --> 00:01:05.060

I<00:01:03.300> down<00:01:03.629> that<00:01:03.899> guy<00:01:04.110> and<00:01:04.320> he<00:01:04.409> gets<00:01:04.589> picked<00:01:04.860> up

00:01:05.060 --> 00:01:05.070 
I down that guy and he gets picked up

00:01:05.070 --> 00:01:06.679 
I down that guy and he gets picked up
and<00:01:05.309> it's<00:01:05.430> just<00:01:05.549> ridiculous<00:01:06.210> i<00:01:06.360> think<00:01:06.600> that

00:01:06.679 --> 00:01:06.689 
and it's just ridiculous i think that

00:01:06.689 --> 00:01:08.899 
and it's just ridiculous i think that
this<00:01:06.780> game<00:01:06.869> needs<00:01:07.260> to<00:01:07.560> have<00:01:07.950> less<00:01:08.310> health<00:01:08.610> or

00:01:08.899 --> 00:01:08.909 
this game needs to have less health or

00:01:08.909 --> 00:01:10.609 
this game needs to have less health or
at<00:01:09.030> least<00:01:09.270> have<00:01:09.479> it<00:01:09.600> be<00:01:09.689> harder<00:01:10.049> to<00:01:10.080> picked<00:01:10.409> up

00:01:10.609 --> 00:01:10.619 
at least have it be harder to picked up

00:01:10.619 --> 00:01:12.620 
at least have it be harder to picked up
to<00:01:10.890> be<00:01:11.010> picked<00:01:11.250> up<00:01:11.460> because<00:01:12.180> right<00:01:12.360> there<00:01:12.600> i

00:01:12.620 --> 00:01:12.630 
to be picked up because right there i

00:01:12.630 --> 00:01:14.060 
to be picked up because right there i
could<00:01:12.720> have<00:01:12.900> had<00:01:12.990> an<00:01:13.170> easy<00:01:13.380> three<00:01:13.770> or<00:01:13.860> four

00:01:14.060 --> 00:01:14.070 
could have had an easy three or four

00:01:14.070 --> 00:01:16.700 
could have had an easy three or four
kills<00:01:14.570> but<00:01:15.570> unfortunately<00:01:16.259> because<00:01:16.500> of<00:01:16.619> the

00:01:16.700 --> 00:01:16.710 
kills but unfortunately because of the

00:01:16.710 --> 00:01:18.710 
kills but unfortunately because of the
health<00:01:16.920> and<00:01:17.159> because<00:01:17.369> of<00:01:17.400> the<00:01:17.549> fact<00:01:17.759> that<00:01:17.909> it's

00:01:18.710 --> 00:01:18.720 
health and because of the fact that it's

00:01:18.720 --> 00:01:21.170 
health and because of the fact that it's
so<00:01:18.960> easy<00:01:19.200> to<00:01:19.380> pick<00:01:19.680> up<00:01:19.979> your<00:01:20.640> teammate<00:01:21.000> and

00:01:21.170 --> 00:01:21.180 
so easy to pick up your teammate and

00:01:21.180 --> 00:01:23.660 
so easy to pick up your teammate and
revive<00:01:21.450> them<00:01:21.720> it<00:01:22.560> makes<00:01:22.740> it<00:01:22.979> you<00:01:23.250> know<00:01:23.280> a

00:01:23.660 --> 00:01:23.670 
revive them it makes it you know a

00:01:23.670 --> 00:01:25.609 
revive them it makes it you know a
little<00:01:24.000> bit<00:01:24.150> difficult<00:01:24.509> to<00:01:24.990> really<00:01:25.380> do

00:01:25.609 --> 00:01:25.619 
little bit difficult to really do

00:01:25.619 --> 00:01:27.469 
little bit difficult to really do
anything<00:01:25.650> in<00:01:26.100> this<00:01:26.189> game<00:01:26.430> unless<00:01:27.240> you're

00:01:27.469 --> 00:01:27.479 
anything in this game unless you're

00:01:27.479 --> 00:01:28.609 
anything in this game unless you're
right<00:01:27.659> next<00:01:27.960> to<00:01:28.020> them<00:01:28.140> with<00:01:28.320> a<00:01:28.350> sawed-off

00:01:28.609 --> 00:01:28.619 
right next to them with a sawed-off

00:01:28.619 --> 00:01:31.730 
right next to them with a sawed-off
