00:01:21.160 --> 00:01:21.170 
this size I figured since you I don't

00:01:21.170 --> 00:01:23.230 
this size I figured since you I don't
really<00:01:21.860> do<00:01:22.220> unboxings<00:01:22.850> or<00:01:22.970> at<00:01:23.030> least<00:01:23.149> I

00:01:23.230 --> 00:01:23.240

00:01:25.139 --> 00:01:25.149 
haven't in the past but I figured since

00:01:25.149 --> 00:01:27.999 
haven't in the past but I figured since
you<00:01:26.149> know<00:01:26.270> I<00:01:26.300> did<00:01:26.600> sell<00:01:26.840> two<00:01:26.990> videos<00:01:27.289> and<00:01:27.710> he<00:01:27.860> is

00:01:27.999 --> 00:01:28.009 
you know I did sell two videos and he is

00:01:28.009 --> 00:01:32.980 
you know I did sell two videos and he is
ganondorf<00:01:29.140> figured<00:01:30.140> I'd<00:01:30.229> do<00:01:30.410> it<00:01:31.869> so<00:01:32.869> yeah

00:01:32.980 --> 00:01:32.990 
ganondorf figured I'd do it so yeah

00:01:32.990 --> 00:01:35.400 
ganondorf figured I'd do it so yeah
let's<00:01:33.140> open<00:01:33.200> him<00:01:33.440> up<00:01:33.500> a<00:01:33.590> little<00:01:33.710> bit<00:01:33.890> more<00:01:34.039> I

00:01:35.400 --> 00:01:35.410

in<00:03:47.900> terms<00:03:48.170> of<00:03:48.380> sheer<00:03:48.650> scale<00:03:49.280> Bowser<00:03:51.070> so<00:03:52.070> he's

00:03:52.180 --> 00:03:52.190 
in terms of sheer scale Bowser so he's

00:03:52.190 --> 00:03:54.070

Ganondorf<00:04:46.410> I'm<00:04:47.410> so<00:04:47.740> glad<00:04:47.860> they<00:04:48.070> actually<00:04:48.400> that

00:04:48.960 --> 00:04:48.970 
Ganondorf I'm so glad they actually that

00:04:48.970 --> 00:04:51.120 
Ganondorf I'm so glad they actually that
translated<00:04:49.660> well<00:04:49.870> into<00:04:50.380> figure<00:04:50.680> form<00:04:50.919> and

00:04:51.120 --> 00:04:51.130 
translated well into figure form and

00:04:51.130 --> 00:04:52.890 
translated well into figure form and
another<00:04:51.940> thing<00:04:52.120> I<00:04:52.210> really<00:04:52.360> like<00:04:52.600> is<00:04:52.630> the

00:04:52.890 --> 00:04:52.900 
another thing I really like is the

00:04:52.900 --> 00:04:57.390 
another thing I really like is the
texture<00:04:53.440> here<00:04:53.680> on<00:04:53.950> his<00:04:54.190> I<00:04:55.350> suppose<00:04:56.350> just<00:04:56.590> armor

00:04:57.390 --> 00:04:57.400 
texture here on his I suppose just armor

00:04:57.400 --> 00:05:00.270 
texture here on his I suppose just armor
or<00:04:57.580> cloth<00:04:57.880> and<00:04:58.150> the<00:04:58.960> same<00:04:59.169> goes<00:04:59.770> for<00:04:59.800> his<00:05:00.040> legs

00:05:00.270 --> 00:05:00.280 
or cloth and the same goes for his legs

00:05:00.280 --> 00:05:03.659 
or cloth and the same goes for his legs
like<00:05:00.550> it<00:05:01.169> it<00:05:02.169> looks<00:05:02.500> like<00:05:02.620> it<00:05:02.860> has<00:05:02.950> a<00:05:02.979> nice<00:05:03.280> sort

00:05:03.659 --> 00:05:03.669 
like it it looks like it has a nice sort

00:05:03.669 --> 00:05:05.490 
like it it looks like it has a nice sort
of<00:05:03.700> cloth<00:05:04.030> texture<00:05:04.479> but<00:05:04.750> again<00:05:05.110> obvious<00:05:05.410> is

00:05:05.490 --> 00:05:05.500 
of cloth texture but again obvious is

00:05:05.500 --> 00:05:07.920 
of cloth texture but again obvious is
just<00:05:05.680> plastic<00:05:06.250> it's<00:05:06.910> got<00:05:07.030> massive<00:05:07.510> feet<00:05:07.780> as

00:05:07.920 --> 00:05:07.930
