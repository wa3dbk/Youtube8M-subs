complete path yeah the ball was out he

00:01:26.790 --> 00:01:28.250 
complete path yeah the ball was out he
didn't<00:01:27.000> have<00:01:27.120> possession<00:01:27.720> as<00:01:27.840> he<00:01:27.960> went<00:01:28.140> across

00:01:28.250 --> 00:01:28.260 
didn't have possession as he went across

00:01:28.260 --> 00:01:30.590 
didn't have possession as he went across
the<00:01:28.650> goal<00:01:28.830> line<00:01:28.860> we<00:01:29.760> were<00:01:29.910> stripped<00:01:30.360> of<00:01:30.480> the

00:01:30.590 --> 00:01:30.600 
the goal line we were stripped of the

00:01:30.600 --> 00:01:33.140 
the goal line we were stripped of the
football<00:01:31.020> he<00:01:31.320> may<00:01:31.470> even<00:01:31.650> have<00:01:32.160> been<00:01:32.220> short<00:01:32.760> of

00:01:33.140 --> 00:01:33.150 
football he may even have been short of

00:01:33.150 --> 00:01:35.270 
football he may even have been short of
the<00:01:33.450> goal<00:01:33.630> line<00:01:33.930> but<00:01:34.710> it<00:01:34.830> looks<00:01:35.070> like<00:01:35.160> a

00:01:35.270 --> 00:01:35.280 
the goal line but it looks like a

00:01:35.280 --> 00:01:41.450 
the goal line but it looks like a
warrior<00:01:35.930> jumped<00:01:36.930> on<00:01:37.110> it<00:01:39.830> so<00:01:40.830> we'll<00:01:41.010> see<00:01:41.250> this

00:01:41.450 --> 00:01:41.460 
warrior jumped on it so we'll see this

00:01:41.460 --> 00:01:43.670 
warrior jumped on it so we'll see this
is<00:01:41.610> going<00:01:41.850> to<00:01:41.940> be<00:01:42.060> this<00:01:42.270> may<00:01:42.480> take<00:01:42.780> until

00:01:43.670 --> 00:01:43.680 
is going to be this may take until

00:01:43.680 --> 00:01:51.590 
is going to be this may take until
tomorrow<00:01:44.310> we<00:01:45.300> might<00:01:45.480> miss<00:01:45.630> our<00:01:45.810> one<00:01:46.110> good<00:01:50.600> look

00:01:51.590 --> 00:01:51.600 
tomorrow we might miss our one good look

another look at this because this this

00:01:55.800 --> 00:02:00.860 
another look at this because this this
is<00:01:56.010> a<00:01:56.210> complex<00:01:57.410> plane<00:01:59.210> see<00:02:00.210> if<00:02:00.270> we<00:02:00.390> can<00:02:00.540> slow<00:02:00.840> it

00:02:00.860 --> 00:02:00.870 
is a complex plane see if we can slow it

00:02:00.870 --> 00:02:05.300 
is a complex plane see if we can slow it
down<00:02:01.400> there<00:02:02.400> solace<00:02:02.970> number<00:02:03.270> one<00:02:03.510> and<00:02:04.310> Pollard

00:02:05.300 --> 00:02:05.310 
down there solace number one and Pollard

00:02:05.310 --> 00:02:08.540 
down there solace number one and Pollard
you<00:02:05.460> see<00:02:05.640> the<00:02:05.760> ball<00:02:06.000> out<00:02:06.860> rolling<00:02:07.860> into<00:02:08.130> the

00:02:08.540 --> 00:02:08.550 
you see the ball out rolling into the

00:02:08.550 --> 00:02:11.150 
you see the ball out rolling into the
end<00:02:08.730> zone<00:02:08.910> now<00:02:09.450> who<00:02:09.660> has<00:02:09.810> possession<00:02:10.020> well<00:02:10.950> no

00:02:11.150 --> 00:02:11.160 
end zone now who has possession well no

00:02:11.160 --> 00:02:16.020 
end zone now who has possession well no
one<00:02:11.340> does<00:02:11.490> at<00:02:11.640> this<00:02:11.790> point<00:02:12.090> and<00:02:12.920> falling<00:02:13.920> on<00:02:14.130> it

00:02:16.020 --> 00:02:16.030 
one does at this point and falling on it

00:02:16.030 --> 00:02:18.960 
one does at this point and falling on it
it's<00:02:16.690> a<00:02:16.840> touchdown<00:02:17.110> and<00:02:17.590> I<00:02:18.280> believe<00:02:18.550> Saul<00:02:18.790> has

00:02:18.960 --> 00:02:18.970 
it's a touchdown and I believe Saul has

00:02:18.970 --> 00:02:23.040 
it's a touchdown and I believe Saul has
scored<00:02:19.240> the<00:02:19.300> touchdown<00:02:19.540> for<00:02:20.110> Hawaii<00:02:22.020> what<00:02:23.020> a
