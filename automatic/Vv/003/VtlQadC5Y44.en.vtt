that avalanche thing which will

00:01:04.350 --> 00:01:14.030 
that avalanche thing which will

13<00:01:14.400> minutes<00:01:14.610> so<00:01:14.939> forth<00:01:15.770> not<00:01:16.770> bad<00:01:16.979> I<00:01:17.009> guess<00:01:17.180> you

00:01:20.870 --> 00:01:20.880 

00:01:20.880 --> 00:01:26.130 

this<00:01:21.880> way<00:01:23.880> you<00:01:24.880> it's<00:01:25.180> a<00:01:25.240> shame<00:01:25.480> you<00:01:25.660> can't<00:01:25.840> fall

00:01:26.130 --> 00:01:26.140 
this way you it's a shame you can't fall

00:01:26.140 --> 00:01:28.320 
this way you it's a shame you can't fall
with<00:01:26.380> me<00:01:26.560> humne<00:01:26.860> but<00:01:27.100> then<00:01:27.700> again<00:01:27.790> how<00:01:28.180> do<00:01:28.240> you

00:01:28.320 --> 00:01:28.330 
with me humne but then again how do you

00:01:28.330 --> 00:01:32.520 
with me humne but then again how do you
like<00:01:28.480> being<00:01:28.510> on<00:01:28.840> my<00:01:29.020> own<00:01:31.080> it's<00:01:32.080> probably<00:01:32.230> not

00:01:32.520 --> 00:01:32.530 
like being on my own it's probably not

00:01:32.530 --> 00:01:34.560 
like being on my own it's probably not
helpful<00:01:32.830> though<00:01:33.160> since<00:01:33.490> you<00:01:33.640> all<00:01:33.820> saw<00:01:34.090> me<00:01:34.330> die

00:01:39.930 --> 00:01:39.940 
but whatever do I even want to do that

00:01:39.940 --> 00:01:45.210 
but whatever do I even want to do that
seems<00:01:40.840> like<00:01:41.020> it<00:01:41.140> leads<00:01:41.320> to<00:01:41.530> a<00:01:41.560> new<00:01:41.740> area<00:01:44.220> I'll

seems like it leads to a new area I'll
deal<00:01:45.670> with<00:01:45.730> it<00:01:45.880> later<00:01:45.940> on<00:01:46.270> I<00:01:46.510> see<00:01:47.290> a<00:01:47.320> shiny
