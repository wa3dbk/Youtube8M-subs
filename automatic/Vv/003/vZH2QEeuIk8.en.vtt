yeah<00:01:36.509> and<00:01:37.170> I<00:01:37.320> think<00:01:37.650> that<00:01:37.950> I<00:01:38.640> think<00:01:39.030> that<00:01:39.210> it

00:01:39.679 --> 00:01:39.689 
yeah and I think that I think that it

00:01:39.689 --> 00:01:41.240 
yeah and I think that I think that it
look<00:01:40.049> when<00:01:40.590> you<00:01:40.680> think<00:01:40.860> about<00:01:40.920> the<00:01:41.130> global

00:01:41.240 --> 00:01:41.250 
look when you think about the global

00:01:41.250 --> 00:01:43.550 
look when you think about the global
monetary<00:01:41.729> base<00:01:42.030> as<00:01:42.600> Andrew<00:01:42.899> just<00:01:43.079> alluded<00:01:43.409> to

00:01:43.550 --> 00:01:43.560 
monetary base as Andrew just alluded to

00:01:43.560 --> 00:01:45.740 
monetary base as Andrew just alluded to
the<00:01:43.799> global<00:01:44.070> monetary<00:01:44.399> base<00:01:44.700> you<00:01:45.119> know<00:01:45.270> is

00:01:45.740 --> 00:01:45.750 
the global monetary base you know is

00:01:45.750 --> 00:01:47.510 
the global monetary base you know is
north<00:01:46.140> of<00:01:46.229> 70<00:01:46.619> trillion<00:01:46.890> all<00:01:47.130> the<00:01:47.250> gold<00:01:47.430> in

00:01:47.510 --> 00:01:47.520 
north of 70 trillion all the gold in

00:01:47.520 --> 00:01:49.670 
north of 70 trillion all the gold in
existence<00:01:48.060> is<00:01:48.270> around<00:01:48.780> 7<00:01:49.170> or<00:01:49.229> 8<00:01:49.350> trillion

00:01:49.670 --> 00:01:49.680

00:01:49.680 --> 00:01:52.280 
existence is around 7 or 8 trillion
there<00:01:50.100> might<00:01:50.220> be<00:01:50.250> a<00:01:50.399> trillion<00:01:50.880> two<00:01:51.840> trillion

00:01:52.280 --> 00:01:52.290 
there might be a trillion two trillion

there might be a trillion two trillion

you know they can make they can mine

00:02:12.720 --> 00:02:14.240 
you know they can make they can mine
some<00:02:13.020> more<00:02:13.200> but<00:02:13.410> they<00:02:13.530> can't<00:02:13.739> print<00:02:13.920> it<00:02:14.010> at<00:02:14.160> the

just view gold is another currency it's
that<00:02:17.610> simple<00:02:17.819> I<00:02:18.060> don't<00:02:18.239> view<00:02:18.360> it<00:02:18.480> as<00:02:18.569> a

00:02:18.589 --> 00:02:18.599 
that simple I don't view it as a

00:02:18.599 --> 00:02:20.720 
that simple I don't view it as a

haven<00:03:10.019> mode<00:03:10.200> do<00:03:10.680> you<00:03:10.769> want<00:03:10.980> to<00:03:11.040> own<00:03:11.160> gold

00:03:11.360 --> 00:03:11.370 
haven mode do you want to own gold

00:03:11.370 --> 00:03:15.680 
haven mode do you want to own gold
rather<00:03:11.670> than<00:03:11.970> US<00:03:12.209> Treasuries<00:03:12.660> I<00:03:12.900> do<00:03:14.569> but<00:03:15.569> you

00:03:15.680 --> 00:03:15.690 
rather than US Treasuries I do but you

00:03:15.690 --> 00:03:17.390 
rather than US Treasuries I do but you
know<00:03:15.720> if<00:03:15.989> if<00:03:16.380> look<00:03:16.739> if<00:03:16.920> something<00:03:17.130> like

00:03:17.390 --> 00:03:17.400 
know if if look if something like

00:03:17.400 --> 00:03:18.920 
know if if look if something like
happens<00:03:17.880> in<00:03:18.060> Japan<00:03:18.150> like<00:03:18.540> we<00:03:18.660> think<00:03:18.780> it's

00:03:18.920 --> 00:03:18.930 
happens in Japan like we think it's

00:03:18.930 --> 00:03:20.930 
happens in Japan like we think it's
going<00:03:19.109> to<00:03:19.170> happen<00:03:19.470> I<00:03:19.709> think<00:03:20.310> US<00:03:20.549> Treasury

00:03:20.930 --> 00:03:20.940 
going to happen I think US Treasury

00:03:20.940 --> 00:03:22.849 
going to happen I think US Treasury
nominal<00:03:21.299> yields<00:03:21.600> ago-<00:03:21.810> or<00:03:22.350> in<00:03:22.470> a<00:03:22.530> flight<00:03:22.739> to

00:03:22.849 --> 00:03:22.859 
nominal yields ago- or in a flight to

00:03:22.859 --> 00:03:24.500 
nominal yields ago- or in a flight to
quality<00:03:22.980> so<00:03:23.519> maybe<00:03:23.730> gold<00:03:24.000> moves<00:03:24.269> up

00:03:24.500 --> 00:03:24.510 
quality so maybe gold moves up

00:03:24.510 --> 00:03:26.569 
quality so maybe gold moves up
Treasuries<00:03:25.470> actually<00:03:25.859> get<00:03:25.980> a<00:03:26.010> much<00:03:26.190> stronger

00:03:26.569 --> 00:03:26.579 
Treasuries actually get a much stronger

00:03:26.579 --> 00:03:28.250 
Treasuries actually get a much stronger
for<00:03:26.760> all<00:03:27.090> of<00:03:27.299> the<00:03:27.389> wrong<00:03:27.540> reasons<00:03:27.569> it's<00:03:28.019> not<00:03:28.109> as

00:03:30.199 --> 00:03:30.209 
endorsement of US fiscal policy because

00:03:30.209 --> 00:03:31.789 
endorsement of US fiscal policy because
it's<00:03:30.389> the<00:03:30.450> only<00:03:30.540> place<00:03:30.660> money<00:03:31.049> has<00:03:31.200> to<00:03:31.230> go<00:03:31.380> but

00:03:38.449 --> 00:03:38.459 
fundamentally if you look at the

00:03:38.459 --> 00:03:40.520 
fundamentally if you look at the
macroeconomic<00:03:38.850> environment<00:03:39.389> things<00:03:40.319> look
