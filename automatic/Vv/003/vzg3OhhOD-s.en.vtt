00:00:05.109 --> 00:00:09.410
 their stalls to learn must be 

00:00:07.490 --> 00:00:10.730
 a lot of patience on the part of 

00:00:09.410 --> 00:00:13.160
 owners will be able to a dog to 

00:00:10.730 --> 00:00:15.800
 puppies clean as much shopping and prof 

00:00:13.160 --> 00:00:17.300
 from the start a puppy wanted to learn him 

00:00:15.800 --> 00:00:19.220
 sketched the puppy is we do not do 

00:00:17.300 --> 00:00:20.419
 not where we sleep but do not know 

00:00:19.220 --> 00:00:22.849
 not to be done outside 

00:00:20.419 --> 00:00:25.070
 then you have a show like once 

00:00:22.849 --> 00:00:26.869
 take it out every day you have to take it out 

00:00:25.070 --> 00:00:29.359
 show every two hours or so he has 

00:00:26.869 --> 00:00:30.679
 two months after each meal at each 

00:00:29.359 --> 00:00:32.930
 time he wakes up after each 

00:00:30.679 --> 00:00:34.610
 game sequence 6 task is small 

00:00:32.930 --> 00:00:36.649
 size you take it in the new 

00:00:34.610 --> 00:00:37.820
 arm you get him down the street where he 

00:00:36.649 --> 00:00:40.399
 to see where he should 

00:00:37.820 --> 00:00:42.769
 eliminate and there as soon as it is eliminated 

00:00:40.399 --> 00:00:44.179
 you will have compensated for it either by voice 

00:00:42.769 --> 00:00:44.780
 often caresses either by 

00:00:44.179 --> 00:00:47.420
 treats 

00:00:44.780 --> 00:00:50.420
 if now he does at home what 

00:00:47.420 --> 00:00:52.789
 will be the case initially especially it is necessary 

00:00:50.420 --> 00:00:53.929
 not punish it a posteriori if you raise 

00:00:52.789 --> 00:00:56.210
 punish him you do it 

00:00:53.929 --> 00:00:58.550
 caught in the act and you take him to 

00:00:56.210 --> 00:01:00.559
 the desired place outside so if 

00:00:58.550 --> 00:01:02.989
 you take it on the fact you have 

00:01:00.559 --> 00:01:05.269
 right 200 physio to say it our and if you 

00:01:02.989 --> 00:01:06.830
 can you start at the desired location 

00:01:05.269 --> 00:01:09.050
 so if you are in a pavilion you 

00:01:06.830 --> 00:01:10.640
 can easily get him out of attention 

00:01:09.050 --> 00:01:12.470
 to the door and let the puppy 

00:01:10.640 --> 00:01:14.660
 to go alone the garden is a very 

00:01:12.470 --> 00:01:17.000
 bad technique because actually he 

00:01:14.660 --> 00:01:18.050
 must be rewarded if you are not 

00:01:17.000 --> 00:01:20.120
 not present there will be no 

00:01:18.050 --> 00:01:21.530
 reward you absolutely must ban the 

00:01:20.120 --> 00:01:23.180
 technical newsprint the 

00:01:21.530 --> 00:01:25.580
 mop or lee because you 

00:01:23.180 --> 00:01:26.870
 materialize where the puppy should 

00:01:25.580 --> 00:01:28.790
 to relieve oneself 

00:01:26.870 --> 00:01:30.950
 so the show him is he can do 

00:01:28.790 --> 00:01:33.080
 in the house and they do not see the 

00:01:30.950 --> 00:01:35.030
 difference between actually this 

00:01:33.080 --> 00:01:37.850
 mop and the carpet that you have to 

00:01:35.030 --> 00:01:40.000
 side a board do not clean in front 

00:01:37.850 --> 00:01:42.550
 him because it can be a posture of 

00:01:40.000 --> 00:01:43.870
 of appeal to the game it is very important 

00:01:42.550 --> 00:01:45.460
 do not clean and products based 

00:01:43.870 --> 00:01:47.920
 of ammonia and bleach cellar or 

00:01:45.460 --> 00:01:50.320
 materialize the place you deodorize 

00:01:47.920 --> 00:01:52.030
 with water in which you have 

00:01:50.320 --> 00:01:55.050
 add a few drops of vinegar 

00:01:52.030 --> 00:01:57.460
 white with either sparkling water 

00:01:55.050 --> 00:01:58.990
 know that the urine is sterile so 

00:01:57.460 --> 00:02:01.110
 you do not have the transmission of 

00:01:58.990 --> 00:02:01.110
 diseases
