00:00:31.539 --> 00:00:36.489
 to hire players 

00:00:33.850 --> 00:00:39.399
 one of the ways is a loan like me 

00:00:36.489 --> 00:00:41.350
 had mentioned the player you want 

00:00:39.399 --> 00:00:43.450

00:00:41.350 --> 00:00:46.450
 ways is a loan like I used to 

00:00:43.450 --> 00:00:48.579
 quoted the player you want you to 

00:00:46.450 --> 00:00:52.060
 simply confirms that hiring 

00:00:48.579 --> 00:00:55.570
 He does not have much detail about him. 

00:00:52.060 --> 00:00:58.000
 now hire player per businessman 

00:00:55.570 --> 00:01:00.870
 I do not have every match I went with. 

00:00:58.000 --> 00:01:03.190
 playing was winning some businessmen 

00:01:00.870 --> 00:01:06.729
 was making some entrepreneurs available 

00:01:03.190 --> 00:01:10.680
 to be able to hire players in 

00:01:06.729 --> 00:01:14.380
 determined certain styles of 

00:01:10.680 --> 00:01:16.689
 strengths and styles of players 

00:01:14.380 --> 00:01:18.759
 in terms of position 

00:01:16.689 --> 00:01:22.420
 I'm not going to give you a test with 

00:01:18.759 --> 00:01:28.689
 this assis first i can mix 

00:01:22.420 --> 00:01:30.969
 up to 3 up to three entrepreneurs to be able to 

00:01:28.689 --> 00:01:34.329
 make a hiring but I'll do 

00:01:30.969 --> 00:01:35.560
 one at a time when the chances are 

00:01:34.329 --> 00:01:38.529
 larger 

00:01:35.560 --> 00:01:41.130
 Where do you hire a good player? 

00:01:38.529 --> 00:01:44.380
 ask to start the negotiation 

00:01:41.130 --> 00:01:47.079
 hire a player to continue there 

00:01:44.380 --> 00:01:51.789
 will open this window here that is where 

00:01:47.079 --> 00:01:56.109
 you depend on the logic and the luck I go 

00:01:51.789 --> 00:01:59.130
 press on the white so it does not 

00:01:56.109 --> 00:02:06.959
 white fall because it 's white is the worst 

00:01:59.130 --> 00:02:09.399
 look at the face bronze player 65 68 69 

00:02:06.959 --> 00:02:10.780
 player you did not spend 

00:02:09.399 --> 00:02:14.280
 money to hire because the 

00:02:10.780 --> 00:02:14.280
 businessman brought it to you 

00:02:15.000 --> 00:02:22.140
 hired now I 'm going to make a mix of 

00:02:19.780 --> 00:02:25.200
 two businesspeople 

00:02:22.140 --> 00:02:31.370
 here are the points had made the 

00:02:25.200 --> 00:02:33.450
 ball control and center attack area 

00:02:31.370 --> 00:02:37.740
 position played the cea 

00:02:33.450 --> 00:02:40.770
 This increases the chances of you 

00:02:37.740 --> 00:02:46.370
 catch a very strong player 

00:02:40.770 --> 00:02:51.360
 and also increases the number of balls 

00:02:46.370 --> 00:02:56.010
 silverware on number of balls and balls 

00:02:51.360 --> 00:02:58.320
 diamond the white feather that is not to 

00:02:56.010 --> 00:03:03.269
 fall on the white 

00:02:58.320 --> 00:03:07.860
 I do not give luck o silver ball steal who 

00:03:03.269 --> 00:03:10.260
 comes araÃºjo 70's ability is seeing the 

00:03:07.860 --> 00:03:11.100
 silver ball is a bit better than the 

00:03:10.260 --> 00:03:16.550
 bronze 

00:03:11.100 --> 00:03:22.290
 obviously confirmed the legal player 

00:03:16.550 --> 00:03:24.920
 Let's try one last time, I'm not. 

00:03:22.290 --> 00:03:27.920
 spending my gps are we 

00:03:24.920 --> 00:03:30.900
 using the entrepreneurs that I acquired 

00:03:27.920 --> 00:03:33.390
 deacon in the course of games to zero 

00:03:30.900 --> 00:03:40.769
 using an entrepreneur only increases the number 

00:03:33.390 --> 00:03:42.510
 of white balls price per square foot of 

00:03:40.769 --> 00:03:44.940
 more white balls that is to avoid 

00:03:42.510 --> 00:03:51.840
 fall on the white balls and I do not give 

00:03:44.940 --> 00:03:57.420
 lucky the white ball pa left side 

00:03:51.840 --> 00:03:59.300
 even needing a left side and 

00:03:57.420 --> 00:04:01.580
 gone 

00:03:59.300 --> 00:04:04.790
 This was the modality of hiring a player 

00:04:01.580 --> 00:04:07.640
 by the way businessman is now let's go 

00:04:04.790 --> 00:04:09.860
 hire the best that is with gp 

00:04:07.640 --> 00:04:10.970
 hire players for the best 

00:04:09.860 --> 00:04:13.640
 businessman 

00:04:10.970 --> 00:04:15.470
 I need a player of 

00:04:13.640 --> 00:04:18.620
 midfield 

00:04:15.470 --> 00:04:21.830
 So I'll talk to my band, right? 

00:04:18.620 --> 00:04:25.180
 I 'm going to use 10 thousand of the GPS for 

00:04:21.830 --> 00:04:27.080
 to be able to hire a midfield player 

00:04:25.180 --> 00:04:31.610
 pay with gp 

00:04:27.080 --> 00:04:33.680
 there goes ten thousand gps noise of the averages 

00:04:31.610 --> 00:04:35.780
 though it is 

00:04:33.680 --> 00:04:37.060
 the scenery is golden so the 

00:04:35.780 --> 00:04:41.770
 possibility of hiring a player 

00:04:37.060 --> 00:04:45.230
 better is 80% 

00:04:41.770 --> 00:04:46.850
 Telling the little girl that I want to 

00:04:45.230 --> 00:04:48.650
 that falls in the daily 

00:04:46.850 --> 00:04:55.670
 the speed that the still ball is also 

00:04:48.650 --> 00:05:01.490
 different ballerina who is of art 

00:04:55.670 --> 00:05:06.020

00:05:09.230 --> 00:05:13.310
 those are the two ways I can 

00:05:12.230 --> 00:05:16.010
 hire the player 

00:05:13.310 --> 00:05:20.060

00:05:28.970 --> 00:05:33.140

00:05:39.440 --> 00:05:44.660
 increase player space here 

00:05:41.450 --> 00:05:48.320

00:05:48.320 --> 00:05:54.050
