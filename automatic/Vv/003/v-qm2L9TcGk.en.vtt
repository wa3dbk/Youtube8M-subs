your at the beginning that's a little

your at the beginning that's a little
bit<00:00:44.610> of<00:00:44.760> a<00:00:44.789> poor<00:00:45.690> place<00:00:46.020> as<00:00:46.320> PPG<00:00:47.219> bubbles<00:00:47.489> is<00:00:47.610> d

00:00:47.810 --> 00:00:47.820 
bit of a poor place as PPG bubbles is d

00:00:47.820 --> 00:00:50.869 
bit of a poor place as PPG bubbles is d
all<00:00:48.059> all<00:00:48.660> in<00:00:49.050> guy<00:00:49.590> except<00:00:50.039> there's<00:00:50.309> a<00:00:50.399> G<00:00:50.640> at<00:00:50.760> the

00:00:50.869 --> 00:00:50.879 
all all in guy except there's a G at the

00:00:50.879 --> 00:00:53.240 
all all in guy except there's a G at the
end<00:00:51.000> so<00:00:51.120> it's<00:00:51.270> like<00:00:51.480> alling<00:00:52.079> all<00:00:52.500> in<00:00:52.800> guy<00:00:52.980> but

00:00:53.240 --> 00:00:53.250 
end so it's like alling all in guy but

00:00:53.250 --> 00:00:54.529 
end so it's like alling all in guy but
that<00:00:53.280> that<00:00:53.640> doesn't<00:00:53.760> really<00:00:53.850> make<00:00:54.090> any<00:00:54.120> sense

00:00:54.529 --> 00:00:54.539 
that that doesn't really make any sense

00:00:54.539 --> 00:00:57.290 
that that doesn't really make any sense
so<00:00:55.020> bubbles<00:00:55.649> it<00:00:55.829> looks<00:00:56.340> like<00:00:56.579> he<00:00:56.820> is<00:00:56.969> gonna<00:00:57.059> be

00:00:57.290 --> 00:00:57.300 
so bubbles it looks like he is gonna be

00:00:57.300 --> 00:00:58.729 
so bubbles it looks like he is gonna be
playing<00:00:57.570> pretty<00:00:57.960> center<00:00:58.289> right<00:00:58.379> now<00:00:58.500> I'm<00:00:58.590> not

00:00:58.729 --> 00:00:58.739 
playing pretty center right now I'm not

00:00:58.739 --> 00:01:00.229 
playing pretty center right now I'm not
gonna<00:00:58.890> do<00:00:59.010> any<00:00:59.190> kind<00:00:59.370> of<00:00:59.399> crazy<00:00:59.670> cheese<00:01:00.000> no

00:01:00.229 --> 00:01:00.239 
gonna do any kind of crazy cheese no

00:01:00.239 --> 00:01:02.450 
gonna do any kind of crazy cheese no
earlier<00:01:00.570> probes<00:01:00.899> and<00:01:01.829> I<00:01:01.920> think<00:01:02.190> he's<00:01:02.340> that

00:01:02.450 --> 00:01:02.460 
earlier probes and I think he's that

00:01:02.460 --> 00:01:04.820 
earlier probes and I think he's that
they're<00:01:02.609> gonna<00:01:02.730> put<00:01:02.940> down<00:01:03.090> a<00:01:03.329> 9<00:01:03.690> or<00:01:03.960> 10<00:01:04.409> pylon

00:01:04.820 --> 00:01:04.830 
they're gonna put down a 9 or 10 pylon

00:01:04.830 --> 00:01:06.410 
they're gonna put down a 9 or 10 pylon
there's<00:01:05.070> this<00:01:05.250> pylon<00:01:05.640> so<00:01:05.790> he's<00:01:05.939> gonna<00:01:06.090> put<00:01:06.299> on

00:01:06.410 --> 00:01:06.420 
there's this pylon so he's gonna put on

00:01:06.420 --> 00:01:08.300 
there's this pylon so he's gonna put on
the<00:01:06.510> high<00:01:06.630> ground<00:01:06.840> usually<00:01:07.229> we<00:01:07.979> see<00:01:08.130> a<00:01:08.159> lot<00:01:08.280> of

00:01:34.290 --> 00:01:35.810 
hatch and so PPG bubbles and you see you
right<00:01:34.439> here<00:01:34.470> he<00:01:34.860> actually<00:01:35.220> rallied<00:01:35.640> his

right here he actually rallied his
worker<00:01:36.150> back<00:01:36.509> because<00:01:37.079> um<00:01:37.409> you<00:01:38.130> can<00:01:38.280> always<00:01:38.490> do

00:01:38.810 --> 00:01:38.820 
worker back because um you can always do

00:01:38.820 --> 00:01:41.240 
worker back because um you can always do
that<00:01:38.850> and<00:01:39.210> check<00:01:39.509> to<00:01:39.900> see<00:01:39.930> if<00:01:40.380> there<00:01:40.770> is<00:01:40.979> gonna

00:01:41.240 --> 00:01:41.250 
that and check to see if there is gonna

00:01:41.250 --> 00:01:42.560 
that and check to see if there is gonna
be<00:01:41.369> an<00:01:41.460> overload<00:01:41.759> there<00:01:41.939> and<00:01:42.090> if<00:01:42.150> there<00:01:42.299> is<00:01:42.420> you

00:01:42.560 --> 00:01:42.570 
be an overload there and if there is you

00:01:42.570 --> 00:01:43.940 
be an overload there and if there is you
immediately<00:01:42.899> know<00:01:43.110> the<00:01:43.140> search<00:01:43.380> position<00:01:43.619> so

00:01:43.940 --> 00:01:43.950 
immediately know the search position so

00:01:43.950 --> 00:01:45.770

Naturals<00:01:59.790> so<00:01:59.909> right<00:02:00.060> now<00:02:00.210> the<00:02:00.750> forge<00:02:01.140> did<00:02:01.439> go

00:02:01.580 --> 00:02:01.590 
Naturals so right now the forge did go

00:02:01.590 --> 00:02:03.469 
Naturals so right now the forge did go
down<00:02:01.619> for<00:02:02.100> bubbles<00:02:02.430> and<00:02:02.640> it<00:02:03.000> looks<00:02:03.180> like<00:02:03.329> he's

00:02:03.469 --> 00:02:03.479 
down for bubbles and it looks like he's

00:02:03.479 --> 00:02:05.389 
down for bubbles and it looks like he's

retard<00:02:07.710> today<00:02:07.979> there's<00:02:08.429> a<00:02:08.550> spawning<00:02:08.940> pool

00:02:09.020 --> 00:02:09.030 
retard today there's a spawning pool

00:02:09.030 --> 00:02:12.680 
retard today there's a spawning pool
going<00:02:09.360> down<00:02:09.599> at<00:02:09.840> 16<00:02:10.470> and<00:02:10.709> the<00:02:11.700> probe<00:02:12.450> is

00:02:12.680 --> 00:02:12.690 
going down at 16 and the probe is

00:02:12.690 --> 00:02:13.750 
going down at 16 and the probe is
spotted<00:02:13.080> there's<00:02:13.290> a<00:02:13.440> drone

00:02:13.750 --> 00:02:13.760 
spotted there's a drone

00:02:13.760 --> 00:02:16.059 
spotted there's a drone
following<00:02:14.120> the<00:02:14.239> probe<00:02:14.480> and<00:02:14.750> so<00:02:15.290> PPG<00:02:15.709> bubbles

00:02:16.059 --> 00:02:16.069 
following the probe and so PPG bubbles

00:02:16.069 --> 00:02:17.800 
following the probe and so PPG bubbles
it<00:02:16.580> looks<00:02:16.819> like<00:02:16.970> he's<00:02:17.120> just<00:02:17.150> gonna<00:02:17.330> go<00:02:17.569> for<00:02:17.750> a

00:02:17.800 --> 00:02:17.810 
it looks like he's just gonna go for a

00:02:17.810 --> 00:02:22.059 
it looks like he's just gonna go for a
cannon<00:02:18.230> rush<00:02:18.519> and<00:02:19.659> so<00:02:20.659> the<00:02:20.989> probe<00:02:21.439> is<00:02:21.680> coming

00:02:22.059 --> 00:02:22.069 
cannon rush and so the probe is coming

00:02:22.069 --> 00:02:24.880 
cannon rush and so the probe is coming
down<00:02:22.189> right<00:02:22.340> now<00:02:22.400> and<00:02:22.849> he<00:02:23.150> puts<00:02:23.480> a<00:02:23.689> pylon<00:02:24.079> here

00:02:24.880 --> 00:02:24.890 
down right now and he puts a pylon here

00:02:24.890 --> 00:02:27.009 
down right now and he puts a pylon here
now<00:02:25.280> the<00:02:25.340> way<00:02:25.730> he<00:02:25.939> did<00:02:26.150> it<00:02:26.180> was<00:02:26.329> that<00:02:26.659> he<00:02:26.810> put<00:02:26.989> a

00:02:27.009 --> 00:02:27.019 
now the way he did it was that he put a

00:02:27.019 --> 00:02:31.059 
now the way he did it was that he put a
pylon<00:02:28.659> right<00:02:29.659> as<00:02:29.840> the<00:02:30.049> probe<00:02:30.409> was<00:02:30.560> walking

00:02:31.059 --> 00:02:31.069 
pylon right as the probe was walking

00:02:31.069 --> 00:02:34.710 
pylon right as the probe was walking
over<00:02:31.310> it<00:02:31.549> and<00:02:31.700> so<00:02:32.239> that<00:02:32.480> actually<00:02:32.900> allows<00:02:33.230> the

00:02:34.710 --> 00:02:34.720 
over it and so that actually allows the

00:02:34.720 --> 00:02:37.449 
over it and so that actually allows the
that<00:02:35.720> actually<00:02:35.959> allows<00:02:36.170> the<00:02:36.409> probe<00:02:36.650> sorry<00:02:36.920> to

00:02:37.449 --> 00:02:37.459 
that actually allows the probe sorry to

00:02:37.459 --> 00:02:39.970 
that actually allows the probe sorry to
actually<00:02:37.909> uh<00:02:37.989> put<00:02:38.989> the<00:02:39.110> pylon<00:02:39.440> in<00:02:39.620> between

00:02:39.970 --> 00:02:39.980 
actually uh put the pylon in between

00:02:39.980 --> 00:02:43.059 
actually uh put the pylon in between
itself<00:02:40.430> and<00:02:40.579> the<00:02:41.030> other<00:02:41.269> drone<00:02:41.629> and<00:02:42.290> so<00:02:42.590> he

00:02:43.059 --> 00:02:43.069 
itself and the other drone and so he

00:02:43.069 --> 00:02:45.220 
itself and the other drone and so he
should<00:02:43.340> be<00:02:43.549> a<00:02:43.670> large<00:02:44.060> amount<00:02:44.390> of<00:02:44.480> drones<00:02:45.170> that

00:02:45.220 --> 00:02:45.230 
should be a large amount of drones that

00:02:45.230 --> 00:02:46.569 
should be a large amount of drones that
are<00:02:45.319> being<00:02:45.500> pulled<00:02:45.709> off<00:02:45.799> ice<00:02:45.980> kinky<00:02:46.310> and<00:02:46.400> this

00:02:46.569 --> 00:02:46.579 
are being pulled off ice kinky and this

00:02:46.579 --> 00:02:48.099 
are being pulled off ice kinky and this
is<00:02:46.700> because<00:02:46.970> he<00:02:47.120> knows<00:02:47.299> that<00:02:47.329> if<00:02:47.659> he<00:02:47.780> can<00:02:47.810> just

00:02:48.099 --> 00:02:48.109 
is because he knows that if he can just

00:02:48.109 --> 00:02:50.110 
is because he knows that if he can just
kill<00:02:48.319> the<00:02:48.409> probe<00:02:48.650> kill<00:02:49.190> the<00:02:49.310> cannon<00:02:49.640> wait

00:02:50.110 --> 00:02:50.120 
kill the probe kill the cannon wait

00:02:50.120 --> 00:02:51.699 
kill the probe kill the cannon wait
until<00:02:50.450> the<00:02:50.510> links<00:02:50.780> come<00:02:50.930> out<00:02:51.079> then<00:02:51.349> he<00:02:51.500> is

00:02:51.699 --> 00:02:51.709 
until the links come out then he is

00:02:51.709 --> 00:02:54.699 
until the links come out then he is
golden<00:02:52.400> for<00:02:53.090> the<00:02:53.450> mid-game<00:02:53.840> and<00:02:54.049> so<00:02:54.260> we<00:02:54.530> have

00:02:54.699 --> 00:02:54.709 
golden for the mid-game and so we have

00:02:54.709 --> 00:02:56.410 
golden for the mid-game and so we have
bubbles<00:02:55.069> being<00:02:55.250> chased<00:02:55.549> around<00:02:55.670> by<00:02:55.819> alexa<00:02:56.239> six

00:02:56.410 --> 00:02:56.420 
bubbles being chased around by alexa six

00:02:56.420 --> 00:02:58.210 
bubbles being chased around by alexa six
or<00:02:56.540> seven<00:02:56.780> drones<00:02:56.989> are<00:02:57.139> now<00:02:57.260> and<00:02:57.470> he<00:02:57.859> does<00:02:58.040> this

00:02:58.210 --> 00:02:58.220 
or seven drones are now and he does this

00:02:58.220 --> 00:03:00.789 
or seven drones are now and he does this
ridiculously<00:02:59.120> sick<00:02:59.540> tactic<00:02:59.989> that<00:03:00.170> timing<00:03:00.500> was

00:03:00.789 --> 00:03:00.799 
ridiculously sick tactic that timing was

00:03:00.799 --> 00:03:04.000 
ridiculously sick tactic that timing was
amazing<00:03:01.340> he<00:03:02.090> put<00:03:02.359> down<00:03:02.510> that<00:03:02.750> pylon<00:03:03.139> right<00:03:03.889> as

00:03:04.000 --> 00:03:04.010 
amazing he put down that pylon right as

00:03:04.010 --> 00:03:06.460 
amazing he put down that pylon right as
a<00:03:04.040> probe<00:03:04.370> walked<00:03:04.579> over<00:03:04.790> and<00:03:05.090> how<00:03:05.840> all<00:03:06.109> these

00:03:06.460 --> 00:03:06.470 
a probe walked over and how all these

00:03:06.470 --> 00:03:11.319 
a probe walked over and how all these
drones<00:03:06.799> are<00:03:06.980> stuck<00:03:09.670> all<00:03:10.670> these<00:03:10.879> drones<00:03:11.150> are

00:03:11.319 --> 00:03:11.329 
drones are stuck all these drones are

00:03:11.329 --> 00:03:14.020 
drones are stuck all these drones are
stuck<00:03:11.599> behind<00:03:12.109> his<00:03:13.010> own<00:03:13.280> natural<00:03:13.700> he's<00:03:13.849> only

00:03:14.020 --> 00:03:14.030 
stuck behind his own natural he's only

00:03:14.030 --> 00:03:15.879 
stuck behind his own natural he's only
got<00:03:14.269> like<00:03:14.569> six<00:03:14.930> showed<00:03:15.200> that<00:03:15.379> his<00:03:15.440> main<00:03:15.620> buddy

00:03:15.879 --> 00:03:15.889 
got like six showed that his main buddy

00:03:15.889 --> 00:03:17.830 
got like six showed that his main buddy
does<00:03:16.099> have<00:03:16.310> four<00:03:16.579> surgeries<00:03:16.790> in<00:03:17.120> and<00:03:17.450> he<00:03:17.629> does

00:03:17.830 --> 00:03:17.840 
does have four surgeries in and he does

00:03:17.840 --> 00:03:19.390 
does have four surgeries in and he does
something<00:03:18.169> else<00:03:18.500> that's<00:03:18.799> even<00:03:19.069> more<00:03:19.099> amazing

00:03:19.390 --> 00:03:19.400 
something else that's even more amazing

00:03:19.400 --> 00:03:21.670 
something else that's even more amazing
he<00:03:19.760> puts<00:03:20.269> out<00:03:20.389> a<00:03:20.419> pylon<00:03:20.780> there<00:03:21.109> that<00:03:21.349> actually

00:03:21.670 --> 00:03:21.680 
he puts out a pylon there that actually

00:03:21.680 --> 00:03:23.439 
he puts out a pylon there that actually
prevents<00:03:22.099> this<00:03:22.220> cannon<00:03:22.549> from<00:03:22.669> being<00:03:22.879> hit<00:03:23.209> so

00:03:23.439 --> 00:03:23.449 
prevents this cannon from being hit so

00:03:23.449 --> 00:03:25.059 
prevents this cannon from being hit so
those<00:03:23.599> zerglings<00:03:24.079> they<00:03:24.560> have<00:03:24.739> to<00:03:24.889> go<00:03:25.040> through

00:03:25.059 --> 00:03:25.069 
those zerglings they have to go through

00:03:25.069 --> 00:03:27.670 
those zerglings they have to go through
this<00:03:25.549> photon<00:03:25.910> cannon<00:03:26.209> in<00:03:26.900> order<00:03:27.230> to<00:03:27.379> execute

00:03:27.670 --> 00:03:27.680 
this photon cannon in order to execute

00:03:27.680 --> 00:03:30.460 
this photon cannon in order to execute
this<00:03:28.069> photon<00:03:28.459> kid<00:03:28.730> so<00:03:29.510> this<00:03:29.690> time<00:03:30.049> again<00:03:30.290> it's

00:03:30.460 --> 00:03:30.470 
this photon kid so this time again it's

00:03:30.470 --> 00:03:32.619 
this photon kid so this time again it's
touched<00:03:30.709> agatha<00:03:31.190> zerglings<00:03:31.579> and<00:03:32.120> it<00:03:32.329> looks

00:03:32.619 --> 00:03:32.629 
touched agatha zerglings and it looks

00:03:32.629 --> 00:03:34.119 
touched agatha zerglings and it looks
like<00:03:32.780> it<00:03:32.930> would<00:03:33.109> go<00:03:33.260> down<00:03:33.410> but<00:03:33.680> that<00:03:33.799> actually

00:03:34.119 --> 00:03:34.129 
like it would go down but that actually

00:03:34.129 --> 00:03:36.009 
like it would go down but that actually
gives<00:03:34.370> enough<00:03:34.699> time<00:03:35.000> for<00:03:35.269> the<00:03:35.359> second<00:03:35.720> photon

00:03:36.009 --> 00:03:36.019 
gives enough time for the second photon

00:03:36.019 --> 00:03:38.349 
gives enough time for the second photon
cannon<00:03:36.319> to<00:03:36.500> finish<00:03:36.769> and<00:03:37.459> it<00:03:37.879> does<00:03:38.150> look<00:03:38.329> like

00:03:38.349 --> 00:03:38.359 
cannon to finish and it does look like

00:03:38.359 --> 00:03:40.420 
cannon to finish and it does look like
all<00:03:38.810> these<00:03:38.989> chunks<00:03:39.620> are<00:03:39.769> gonna<00:03:39.919> be<00:03:40.099> dead<00:03:40.280> they

00:03:40.420 --> 00:03:40.430 
all these chunks are gonna be dead they
