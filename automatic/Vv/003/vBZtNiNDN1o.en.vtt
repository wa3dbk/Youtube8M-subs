 This is the transmission of ECO! 

00:00:06.300 --> 00:00:10.640
 Science of the highest level and life behind the walls 

00:00:10.640 --> 00:00:14.580
 of the European Southern Observatory. 

00:00:32.580 --> 00:00:36.280
 Tourists will know Chile as Land of 

00:00:36.280 --> 00:00:39.580
 natural wonders and dry deserts.

 In an almost non-terrestrial location in Chilean Andes, 

00:01:01.600 --> 00:01:04.420
 ALMA is almost complete. 

00:01:19.270 --> 00:01:26.250
 Chahmantor Plateau at 5000 meters high. 

00:01:55.320 --> 00:02:02.510
 The largest existing ground-based astronomical project. 

00:02:09.100 --> 00:02:13.000
 The APEX stand-alone radio telescope also 

00:02:13.000 --> 00:02:16.400
 is located in Chahamntor Plateau. 

00:02:33.600 --> 00:02:37.040
 ALMA will explore the building blocks of the stars, 

00:02:37.040 --> 00:02:41.000
 planetary systems, galaxies, and life itself. 

00:05:49.040 --> 00:05:52.620
 The transmission of ECO was produced by the European Southern Observatory. 

00:05:52.620 --> 00:05:54.900
 The European Southern Observatory, 

00:05:54.900 --> 00:05:57.800
 is the supreme intergovernmental scientific and technological organization in astronomy, 

00:05:57.800 --> 00:06:00.800
 Among the two types of ground and space observatories, ECO is the most productive observatory in the world.
