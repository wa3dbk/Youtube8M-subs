00:00:58.520 --> 00:00:58.530 
and the earnings per share so let's just

00:00:58.530 --> 00:01:02.299 
and the earnings per share so let's just
do<00:00:58.649> a<00:00:58.680> quick<00:00:58.890> example<00:00:59.609> here<00:00:59.750> imagine<00:01:00.750> if<00:01:01.410> we

00:01:02.299 --> 00:01:02.309 
do a quick example here imagine if we

00:01:02.309 --> 00:01:06.679 
do a quick example here imagine if we
have<00:01:02.460> a<00:01:02.489> company<00:01:03.350> which<00:01:04.350> has<00:01:04.400> EPS<00:01:05.400> of<00:01:05.670> 10<00:01:06.360> P

00:01:06.679 --> 00:01:06.689 
have a company which has EPS of 10 P

00:01:06.689 --> 00:01:11.600 
have a company which has EPS of 10 P
there's<00:01:07.260> 10<00:01:07.560> P<00:01:07.890> of<00:01:08.460> earnings<00:01:09.240> per<00:01:09.750> share<00:01:10.610> let's

00:01:11.600 --> 00:01:11.610 
there's 10 P of earnings per share let's

00:01:11.610 --> 00:01:15.200 
there's 10 P of earnings per share let's
say<00:01:11.729> the<00:01:12.090> share<00:01:12.360> price<00:01:13.729> let's<00:01:14.729> say<00:01:14.850> let's<00:01:15.090> say

00:01:15.200 --> 00:01:15.210 
say the share price let's say let's say

00:01:15.210 --> 00:01:19.609 
say the share price let's say let's say
the<00:01:15.950> yeah<00:01:16.950> the<00:01:17.100> share<00:01:17.310> price<00:01:17.549> is<00:01:17.580> 100<00:01:18.270> P<00:01:18.619> then

00:01:19.609 --> 00:01:19.619 
the yeah the share price is 100 P then

00:01:19.619 --> 00:01:21.649 
the yeah the share price is 100 P then
you<00:01:19.650> have<00:01:19.890> the<00:01:20.040> next<00:01:20.250> concept<00:01:20.790> which<00:01:21.119> is<00:01:21.299> a<00:01:21.330> p/e

00:01:21.649 --> 00:01:21.659 
you have the next concept which is a p/e

00:01:21.659 --> 00:01:23.240 
you have the next concept which is a p/e
ratio<00:01:22.229> which<00:01:22.380> is<00:01:22.500> the<00:01:22.590> price<00:01:22.860> to<00:01:23.100> earnings

00:01:23.240 --> 00:01:23.250 
ratio which is the price to earnings

00:01:23.250 --> 00:01:25.609 
ratio which is the price to earnings
ratio<00:01:23.970> that<00:01:24.450> means<00:01:24.720> that<00:01:25.049> earnings<00:01:25.380> per<00:01:25.590> share

00:01:25.609 --> 00:01:25.619 
ratio that means that earnings per share

00:01:25.619 --> 00:01:29.300 
ratio that means that earnings per share
divided<00:01:26.340> by<00:01:26.640> the<00:01:26.700> share<00:01:26.970> price<00:01:27.240> itself<00:01:28.040> and<00:01:29.040> in

00:01:29.300 --> 00:01:29.310 
divided by the share price itself and in

00:01:29.310 --> 00:01:33.980 
divided by the share price itself and in
this<00:01:29.689> example<00:01:30.689> it's<00:01:31.110> a<00:01:31.619> p/e<00:01:32.400> of<00:01:32.640> 10<00:01:32.970> the<00:01:33.600> reason

00:01:33.980 --> 00:01:33.990 
this example it's a p/e of 10 the reason

00:01:33.990 --> 00:01:36.289 
this example it's a p/e of 10 the reason
ye<00:01:34.170> PS<00:01:34.680> is<00:01:35.040> important<00:01:35.640> to<00:01:35.700> the<00:01:35.790> financial

00:01:36.289 --> 00:01:36.299 
ye PS is important to the financial

00:01:36.299 --> 00:01:38.960 
ye PS is important to the financial
community<00:01:36.479> is<00:01:37.470> they<00:01:37.890> want<00:01:38.100> to<00:01:38.250> see<00:01:38.460> a<00:01:38.490> growth

00:01:38.960 --> 00:01:38.970 
community is they want to see a growth

00:01:38.970 --> 00:01:40.760 
community is they want to see a growth
in<00:01:39.000> the<00:01:39.450> share<00:01:39.659> price<00:01:39.930> how<00:01:40.320> does<00:01:40.470> that<00:01:40.590> happen

00:01:40.760 --> 00:01:40.770 
in the share price how does that happen

00:01:40.770 --> 00:01:44.840 
in the share price how does that happen
one<00:01:41.490> of<00:01:41.640> the<00:01:41.790> ways<00:01:41.939> it<00:01:42.210> happens<00:01:42.600> is<00:01:42.840> when<00:01:43.850> the

00:01:44.840 --> 00:01:44.850 
one of the ways it happens is when the

00:01:44.850 --> 00:01:48.109 
one of the ways it happens is when the
earnings<00:01:45.750> go<00:01:45.990> up<00:01:46.610> so<00:01:47.610> the<00:01:47.729> financial

00:01:48.109 --> 00:01:48.119 
earnings go up so the financial

00:01:48.119 --> 00:01:53.179 
earnings go up so the financial
community<00:01:48.680> will<00:01:51.079> imagine<00:01:52.079> this<00:01:52.140> is<00:01:52.320> 2,000

00:01:53.179 --> 00:01:53.189 
community will imagine this is 2,000

00:01:53.189 --> 00:01:59.050 
community will imagine this is 2,000
just<00:01:53.969> do<00:01:56.509> the<00:01:57.509> finance<00:01:57.869> community<00:01:58.109> will<00:01:58.740> base

00:01:59.050 --> 00:01:59.060 
just do the finance community will base

00:01:59.060 --> 00:02:02.419 
just do the finance community will base
their<00:02:00.060> appraisals<00:02:00.899> of<00:02:01.140> a<00:02:01.229> stock<00:02:01.560> or<00:02:01.829> business

on the earnings growth in the earnings
of<00:02:04.770> company<00:02:05.219> so<00:02:05.909> let's<00:02:05.939> say<00:02:07.190> the<00:02:08.190> earnings<00:02:08.610> of

00:02:08.869 --> 00:02:08.879
