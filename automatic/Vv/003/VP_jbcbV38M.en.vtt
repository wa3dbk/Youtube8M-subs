00:00:00.959 --> 00:00:05.200
 so have her job today is a candlestick which is quite funny Sun though how to do that 

00:00:05.200 --> 00:00:07.050
 new virus a dec 

00:00:07.050 --> 00:00:10.439
 from the Mac as well as c playing on it again 

00:00:10.439 --> 00:00:15.909
 there is then, inter alia, percentage point of sd card possible and of usb-stick 

00:00:15.909 --> 00:00:17.019
 also directly 

00:00:17.019 --> 00:00:18.939
 without this magic i 

00:00:18.939 --> 00:00:22.800
 how we need to do this what we need this footpath 

00:00:22.800 --> 00:00:24.350
 to the Athenians 

00:00:24.350 --> 00:00:28.920
 You can read this on our homepage percent DW as tar point he 

00:00:28.920 --> 00:00:30.529
 is - Impact 

00:00:30.529 --> 00:00:32.820
 Punk is also on the lower left 

00:00:32.820 --> 00:00:35.010
 in my content you can Ahlen 

00:00:35.010 --> 00:00:39.360
 Now let's have a look at this stick which is really important 

00:00:39.360 --> 00:00:39.720
 is 

00:00:39.720 --> 00:00:42.910
 Percent if you maybe you definitely need one 

00:00:42.910 --> 00:00:44.280
 around 

00:00:44.280 --> 00:00:47.770
 all the more must be on the stream yes that disgusts me that in between from ca 

00:00:47.770 --> 00:00:49.270
 then you could stink too 

00:00:49.270 --> 00:00:52.910
 Percent to have its still connected to the car this afternoon 

00:00:52.910 --> 00:00:55.280
 also quite right 

00:00:55.280 --> 00:00:57.010
 Floor painted by the part 

00:00:57.010 --> 00:00:57.970
 easy 

00:00:57.970 --> 00:01:02.560
 Embroidery then the sensor fits the hold while offering that 

00:01:02.560 --> 00:01:06.259
 turn off so strangulation could just keep pushing it longer 

00:01:07.800 --> 00:01:09.980
 now the whole thing is going down 

00:01:09.980 --> 00:01:12.000
 then just once 

00:01:12.000 --> 00:01:14.610
 start normally 

00:01:14.610 --> 00:01:17.860
 and usually he should now from the usb-stick stalls 

00:01:18.690 --> 00:01:21.690
 and this Windows 98 ms dos 

00:01:22.270 --> 00:01:25.670
 AR Markus Hofer and that worked as a whole 

00:01:26.260 --> 00:01:28.890
 this is a Windows 98 m discus throw 

00:01:28.890 --> 00:01:31.200
 Alone with him 

00:01:31.200 --> 00:01:34.270
 this is currently on ours 

00:01:34.270 --> 00:01:35.640
 USD is 

00:01:35.640 --> 00:01:37.780
 Now let's just do this here 

00:01:37.780 --> 00:01:41.640
 Car expert the use and authenticity of the 1 point has Aust 

00:01:42.900 --> 00:01:44.000
 authors 

00:01:44.000 --> 00:01:45.630
 6 

00:01:45.630 --> 00:01:48.630
 Cases icons is next to the one with Shift 

00:01:50.290 --> 00:01:53.280
 Point dapd 

00:01:53.280 --> 00:01:56.049
 the hobby the thing works otherwise the live is like us 

00:01:56.049 --> 00:01:59.049
 our offers shock 

00:02:00.980 --> 00:02:03.980
 yes he does something 

00:02:07.979 --> 00:02:10.469
 should he do more now or 

00:02:10.469 --> 00:02:13.469
 dpa there 

00:02:14.789 --> 00:02:17.789
 Brewers 12% 18 21 

00:02:21.319 --> 00:02:24.729
 So supposedly synonymous to this percent new BIOS 

00:02:24.729 --> 00:02:27.729
 be operable via Kapsch 

00:02:28.309 --> 00:02:32.069
 Generally more power Percent I think so stupid bring the Alb the acute 

00:02:32.069 --> 00:02:35.069
 even such a book read reforms quickly 

00:02:36.739 --> 00:02:39.739
 per person who really care about us because they can not 

00:02:41.999 --> 00:02:44.999
 I'm also curious if then our windows will run 

00:02:45.829 --> 00:02:48.959
 I did not believe it 

00:02:48.959 --> 00:02:51.189
 So, if necessary, everything first 

00:02:51.189 --> 00:02:53.909
 save what you need before 

00:02:53.909 --> 00:02:56.809
 were taught 

00:02:56.809 --> 00:02:59.809
 developed 

00:03:05.379 --> 00:03:08.379
 Lord, it's a bit boring now, but okay 

00:03:13.669 --> 00:03:16.669
 now is off 

00:03:16.669 --> 00:03:17.799
 the trains on 

00:03:17.799 --> 00:03:20.799
 w 

00:03:23.829 --> 00:03:26.829
 it's made of silver 

00:03:32.959 --> 00:03:35.209
 Franconia 

00:03:35.209 --> 00:03:38.209
 he avoids 

00:03:41.229 --> 00:03:44.229
 yes Webber also starts that is very nice 

00:03:45.839 --> 00:03:47.689
 but she was there 

00:03:47.689 --> 00:03:50.689
 want to start good over Windows 

00:03:55.839 --> 00:03:58.839
 but no plus is 

00:04:02.729 --> 00:04:05.419
 szo I think that's it then 

00:04:05.419 --> 00:04:08.419
 Percent like the bios too 

00:04:09.129 --> 00:04:11.939
 there are actually already video judge but still put 

00:04:11.939 --> 00:04:13.369
 short 

00:04:13.369 --> 00:04:15.299
 it's a long time 

00:04:15.299 --> 00:04:17.969
 Here is a special link 

00:04:17.969 --> 00:04:18.719
 the same
