00:00:10.890 --> 00:00:16.920
 We were effective when converting 

00:00:14.340 --> 00:00:18.570
 the options we had and I think that 

00:00:16.920 --> 00:00:21.740
 we make a difference 

00:00:18.570 --> 00:00:24.380
 asked Julian Salazar de caracol 

00:00:21.740 --> 00:00:27.240
 good technical commitment in which 

00:00:24.380 --> 00:00:30.140
 independent santa faith maybe it did not start 

00:00:27.240 --> 00:00:30.140
 with the same then everyone 

00:00:31.030 --> 00:00:35.290
 the technician then asked that 

00:00:33.280 --> 00:00:36.820
 we saw in independent santa faith that in 

00:00:35.290 --> 00:00:38.830
 the principle may not accommodate the 

00:00:36.820 --> 00:00:41.080
 better way but he started the caldas 

00:00:38.830 --> 00:00:42.820
 to propose and come say a match 

00:00:41.080 --> 00:00:44.260
 atypical with all situations that 

00:00:42.820 --> 00:00:46.270
 they presented that you believe that it was 

00:00:44.260 --> 00:00:47.560
 what happened for the game to end 

00:00:46.270 --> 00:00:53.430
 A) Yes 

00:00:47.560 --> 00:00:57.790
 and the first 15 minutes caldas 

00:00:53.430 --> 00:00:59.620
 pressed well we were complicated by the sector 

00:00:57.790 --> 00:01:01.010
 right our left sector of 

00:00:59.620 --> 00:01:03.800
 they 

00:01:01.010 --> 00:01:06.170
 with a shot that kicks off a shot 

00:01:03.800 --> 00:01:09.270
 that sticks on the stick 

00:01:06.170 --> 00:01:10.770
 a center that does not define well their 

00:01:09.270 --> 00:01:11.880
 first fifteen minutes for us 

00:01:10.770 --> 00:01:14.710
 were 

00:01:11.880 --> 00:01:17.710
 that can be said critical 

00:01:14.710 --> 00:01:20.380
 I think we were taking the idea of 

00:01:17.710 --> 00:01:24.280
 cargo party was going to attack 

00:01:20.380 --> 00:01:25.780
 is going down spaces and what came out 

00:01:24.280 --> 00:01:28.840
 we have thought is to have that 

00:01:25.780 --> 00:01:31.960
 tranquility that solidity we have the 

00:01:28.840 --> 00:01:34.119
 critical luck is true but following 

00:01:31.960 --> 00:01:35.890
 from which we take confidence and 

00:01:34.119 --> 00:01:37.810
 We begin to take advantage of the spaces that 

00:01:35.890 --> 00:01:39.460
 We are going down Lonxe 

00:01:37.810 --> 00:01:43.409
 we went upstairs in the manuel in the 

00:01:39.460 --> 00:01:43.409
 marker is always very important 

00:01:44.409 --> 00:01:54.679
 before the victory over the handling of 

00:01:52.280 --> 00:01:57.020
 commitment you on the fourth goal for 

00:01:54.679 --> 00:01:59.689
 and you must stop the key of 

00:01:57.020 --> 00:02:02.450
 they lowered the pace of the order that 

00:01:59.689 --> 00:02:05.270
 from the bank do not do our 

00:02:02.450 --> 00:02:08.140
 defined missed match and the first thing that 

00:02:05.270 --> 00:02:09.709
 I told them guys when we entered 

00:02:08.140 --> 00:02:13.910
 congratulations but this has not finished 

00:02:09.709 --> 00:02:15.860
 we missed a game that is important 

00:02:13.910 --> 00:02:19.670
 for us that is wrong in front of a 

00:02:15.860 --> 00:02:23.170
 great team and already one day I'm great in 

00:02:19.670 --> 00:02:25.390
 the team the group ran quite 

00:02:23.170 --> 00:02:26.920
 those who want us to lower the 

00:02:25.390 --> 00:02:29.680
 rhythm we want to try to manage a 

00:02:26.920 --> 00:02:32.610
 little the ball try to dose a 

00:02:29.680 --> 00:02:36.239
 Pochitic and avoid for any injury 

00:02:32.610 --> 00:02:39.220
 some expulsion some contrariety 

00:02:36.239 --> 00:02:40.690
 but the idea if they realized for 

00:02:39.220 --> 00:02:43.840
 this we had the possibility to attack them 

00:02:40.690 --> 00:02:47.430
 quick to score another goal 

00:02:43.840 --> 00:02:47.430
 franc product 

00:02:48.940 --> 00:02:53.500
 now will combine a penalty goal play 

00:02:51.489 --> 00:02:56.890
 the commitment that leaps from the 

00:02:53.500 --> 00:02:59.860
 opening in the important score I think 

00:02:56.890 --> 00:03:02.410
 that when when we go up with 

00:02:59.860 --> 00:03:07.500
 that criminal is important is much more 

00:03:02.410 --> 00:03:07.500
 important goal after them 

00:03:07.690 --> 00:03:12.880
 we did not despair we had the 

00:03:09.700 --> 00:03:15.130
 quiet we did not open spaces we went 

00:03:12.880 --> 00:03:16.660
 solid on the contrary I think we are 

00:03:15.130 --> 00:03:19.180
 smart and we take advantage of the spaces 

00:03:16.660 --> 00:03:21.100
 that they were leaving them in the part of 

00:03:19.180 --> 00:03:23.460
 back to continue watching them up in the 

00:03:21.100 --> 00:03:23.460
 marker 

00:03:25.290 --> 00:03:35.740
 good night two questions the first 

00:03:29.910 --> 00:03:37.720
 of the professor good evening we are in 

00:03:35.740 --> 00:03:39.790
 I live to win news at this moment 

00:03:37.720 --> 00:03:41.560
 I wanted to ask you two things first if 

00:03:39.790 --> 00:03:43.480
 believes that the keys are already defined and 

00:03:41.560 --> 00:03:45.340
 there is no turning of the page for 

00:03:43.480 --> 00:03:47.500
 classifying the theme of wilder medina 

00:03:45.340 --> 00:03:49.900
 that if he still came with two yellows and 

00:03:47.500 --> 00:03:51.580
 if it was not easier to say let's do that 

00:03:49.900 --> 00:03:53.410
 this forward was made take out the 

00:03:51.580 --> 00:03:56.080
 third cardboard that will pay in Bogota 

00:03:53.410 --> 00:03:58.720
 to be totally clean on the subject 

00:03:56.080 --> 00:04:00.700
 of the parties that are surely going to 

00:03:58.720 --> 00:04:02.700
 dispute if the set is classified 

00:04:00.700 --> 00:04:05.160
 cardinal good night 

00:04:02.700 --> 00:04:08.099
 and I repeat as before for me not 

00:04:05.160 --> 00:04:09.950
 is defined 90 minutes are missing 90 

00:04:08.099 --> 00:04:11.959
 key minutes 

00:04:09.950 --> 00:04:14.060
 and I repeat the first thing I talk to you 

00:04:11.959 --> 00:04:16.700
 boys apart from congratulating them for the 

00:04:14.060 --> 00:04:19.010
 great game that was clear to us 

00:04:16.700 --> 00:04:21.200
 the game is missing and so are we 

00:04:19.010 --> 00:04:24.290
 we came is a great match and we scored 

00:04:21.200 --> 00:04:26.030
 high we do not have an important rival with 

00:04:24.290 --> 00:04:28.340
 important players and that are going to 

00:04:26.030 --> 00:04:30.320
 want to go to Bogota to also look for 

00:04:28.340 --> 00:04:32.750
 party then there is nothing definite 

00:04:30.320 --> 00:04:35.210
 we have to go step by step and we have a 

00:04:32.750 --> 00:04:37.160
 important step is true but in Bogota 

00:04:35.210 --> 00:04:43.490
 we have to go ratify what we did 

00:04:37.160 --> 00:04:46.690
 today here very well if it could be that I 

00:04:43.490 --> 00:04:51.169
 He supported taking out the card to fulfill the 

00:04:46.690 --> 00:04:52.910
 party for what is coming but but good 

00:04:51.169 --> 00:04:55.910
 he gave it was not given and the important thing is 

00:04:52.910 --> 00:04:57.930
 that we are there are the situations that 

00:04:55.910 --> 00:05:00.479
 they occur in football 

00:04:57.930 --> 00:05:03.690
 then nothing has to be handled. 

00:05:00.479 --> 00:05:06.090
 manage your card that possibility and 

00:05:03.690 --> 00:05:09.389
 keep going and working we can 

00:05:06.090 --> 00:05:11.729
 talk about two matches one is the criminal 

00:05:09.389 --> 00:05:13.080
 while he is driving around the 11 and another 

00:05:11.729 --> 00:05:15.150
 later when it was very favorable for 

00:05:13.080 --> 00:05:17.100
 santa fe believed that the difference 

00:05:15.150 --> 00:05:19.560
 they make the players of santa faith a lot 

00:05:17.100 --> 00:05:21.389
 more experienced with more hierarchy and 

00:05:19.560 --> 00:05:22.949
 those of 11 that maybe because of the lack of 

00:05:21.389 --> 00:05:24.579
 that experience were not effective and there 

00:05:22.949 --> 00:05:29.179
 change everything 

00:05:24.579 --> 00:05:32.760
 I believe that the initial 15 minutes the 

00:05:29.179 --> 00:05:35.220
 broth went out to propose went over 

00:05:32.760 --> 00:05:37.710
 we got lucky where he hits the stick 

00:05:35.220 --> 00:05:39.930
 Camilo took a ball up important 

00:05:37.710 --> 00:05:41.700
 they do not have the effective when it comes to 

00:05:39.930 --> 00:05:44.220
 define were 15 minutes back I repeat 

00:05:41.700 --> 00:05:46.080
 if you can call it like that critics for 

00:05:44.220 --> 00:05:48.780
 us because we did not find him 

00:05:46.080 --> 00:05:51.060
 we were not precise to the 

00:05:48.780 --> 00:05:53.600
 time to dial when we found 

00:05:51.060 --> 00:05:56.610
 go up we start to manage better 

00:05:53.600 --> 00:05:58.410
 take advantage of story ss is but I do not know 

00:05:56.610 --> 00:05:59.820
 tell him in experience with the 

00:05:58.410 --> 00:06:01.620
 experience from us but we started 

00:05:59.820 --> 00:06:04.170
 to better manage the game better 

00:06:01.620 --> 00:06:05.730
 look for the spaces and find what 

00:06:04.170 --> 00:06:08.400
 we had planned those 

00:06:05.730 --> 00:06:10.410
 spaces that can walk on the side of 

00:06:08.400 --> 00:06:12.870
 obese that gave a lot of output on the side 

00:06:10.410 --> 00:06:15.480
 of piedrahÃ­ta with visiting them and with leather 

00:06:12.870 --> 00:06:16.830
 each one for its sector with mobility 

00:06:15.480 --> 00:06:18.450
 from wilber I think we started finding 

00:06:16.830 --> 00:06:19.890
 the spaces and he was doing the 

00:06:18.450 --> 00:06:22.610
 favorable party for what we have 

00:06:19.890 --> 00:06:22.610
 worked us
