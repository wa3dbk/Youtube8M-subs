00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.939
 hi everyone so today I 

00:00:01.439 --> 00:00:06.180
 presented a tweak so interesting to 

00:00:02.939 --> 00:00:08.849
 own on having on his iphone so 

00:00:06.180 --> 00:00:10.650
 the tuc is called a cleaner he is 

00:00:08.849 --> 00:00:11.730
 pretty well known normally but if you 

00:00:10.650 --> 00:00:14.309
 do not know I advise you to 

00:00:11.730 --> 00:00:16.440
 the install it is available on the 

00:00:14.309 --> 00:00:19.310
 source of big boss it looks good 

00:00:16.440 --> 00:00:21.660
 all this is free 

00:00:19.310 --> 00:00:26.340
 so we could see it is available 

00:00:21.660 --> 00:00:28.019
 for iphone ipod and ipad then site lite 

00:00:26.340 --> 00:00:30.630
 allows you to clean your iphone so 

00:00:28.019 --> 00:00:35.280
 save space on your iphone so 

00:00:30.630 --> 00:00:37.710
 sent it's here that tells you the space 

00:00:35.280 --> 00:00:40.800
 available in general as well as space 

00:00:37.710 --> 00:00:41.700
 system what I find interesting 

00:00:40.800 --> 00:00:45.260
 is that you can for example 

00:00:41.700 --> 00:00:49.800
 deleted attachments 

00:00:45.260 --> 00:00:52.020
 ddd message so bullshit there we can 

00:00:49.800 --> 00:00:55.399
 not so if you have received pictures or 

00:00:52.020 --> 00:00:57.840
 what so to see have room 

00:00:55.399 --> 00:00:59.070
 it offers you also clean safari 

00:00:57.840 --> 00:01:00.800
 so that's for sure my stuff and cookies and 

00:00:59.070 --> 00:01:03.270
 and so on 

00:01:00.800 --> 00:01:06.330
 the apps you can clean 

00:01:03.270 --> 00:01:09.330
 things in cydia is to go on this 

00:01:06.330 --> 00:01:10.049
 site many unused dependencies of 

00:01:09.330 --> 00:01:11.400
 log files 

00:01:10.049 --> 00:01:14.189
 so that's all that is system 

00:01:11.400 --> 00:01:17.070
 temporary hidden files and types 

00:01:14.189 --> 00:01:21.270
 of files you can hot so there 

00:01:17.070 --> 00:01:24.540
 those who are here once 

00:01:21.270 --> 00:01:27.150
 you did cleaning you can 

00:01:24.540 --> 00:01:29.369
 so simply clicked obs his 

00:01:27.150 --> 00:01:30.890
 cleaning all over you have 

00:01:29.369 --> 00:01:34.310
 some settings to see a test mode 

00:01:30.890 --> 00:01:37.369
 you can for example if necessary 

00:01:34.310 --> 00:01:39.540
 exclude certain software 

00:01:37.369 --> 00:01:43.890
 so do you see the coachmen simply 

00:01:39.540 --> 00:01:45.680
 by going into the settings you can 

00:01:43.890 --> 00:01:49.400
 as well 

00:01:45.680 --> 00:01:50.990
 pop up bought the app will be 

00:01:49.400 --> 00:01:54.290
 apparently he searched to make a donation to 

00:01:50.990 --> 00:01:56.000
 the person no spear if you are on 

00:01:54.290 --> 00:01:57.440
 windows you can know this 

00:01:56.000 --> 00:02:00.200
 software also called ricklin 

00:01:57.440 --> 00:02:01.430
 hours and works as well so 

00:02:00.200 --> 00:02:02.810
 to be able to make a silver canvas 

00:02:01.430 --> 00:02:05.810
 when you 10 ticked them what 

00:02:02.810 --> 00:02:08.650
 you need or not and then you 

00:02:05.810 --> 00:02:08.650
 do cleaning 

00:02:16.110 --> 00:02:19.900
 then once 

00:02:18.340 --> 00:02:24.040
 you are reporting it by klein cleaner 

00:02:19.900 --> 00:02:25.780
 cleaning finished cleared spaces 662 m 

00:02:24.040 --> 00:02:26.760
 ib so glazes no it's not at 

00:02:25.780 --> 00:02:30.459
 neglect 

00:02:26.760 --> 00:02:31.390
 and then there is faro sprinting so I have 

00:02:30.459 --> 00:02:32.010
 no mercy it's him who makes him 

00:02:31.390 --> 00:02:35.860
 automatically 

00:02:32.010 --> 00:02:39.370
 so less you need to restart 

00:02:35.860 --> 00:02:41.290
 but so does their spring and then from 

00:02:39.370 --> 00:02:42.700
 you can go and check yourself 

00:02:41.290 --> 00:02:44.920
 in the settings so in 

00:02:42.700 --> 00:02:48.959
 information as to what he has 

00:02:44.920 --> 00:02:53.610
 deleted from the files you have 

00:02:48.959 --> 00:02:55.989
 that you asked him to delete 

00:02:53.610 --> 00:02:58.540
 so as you could see that which 

00:02:55.989 --> 00:02:59.730
 appeared so here is the applications 

00:02:58.540 --> 00:03:02.590
 that I checked so if I had 

00:02:59.730 --> 00:03:06.549
 unchecked at that moment simply 

00:03:02.590 --> 00:03:08.319
 he would not have to remove much of which 

00:03:06.549 --> 00:03:09.489
 as I saw six years is dead so me 

00:03:08.319 --> 00:03:10.540
 for my part while I do the facts 

00:03:09.489 --> 00:03:11.829
 not so long ago that it goes so 

00:03:10.540 --> 00:03:12.910
 it's not insignificant and I 

00:03:11.829 --> 00:03:13.650
 just advise to do it 

00:03:12.910 --> 00:03:15.940
 you too 

00:03:13.650 --> 00:03:18.220
 so when I have already repeated enough 

00:03:15.940 --> 00:03:19.720
 the application is called cleaner is 

00:03:18.220 --> 00:03:21.299
 available free on the source of 

00:03:19.720 --> 00:03:25.170
 big boss and I advise you 

00:03:21.299 --> 00:03:25.170
 greatly and so that's it
