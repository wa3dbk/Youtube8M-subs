 So I have to find out. 

00:00:12.120 --> 00:00:13.769

 Well, if you have an accurate report before this mobile 

00:00:32.579 --> 00:00:33.980
 Your upper body is revealed first 

00:00:33.980 --> 00:00:34.880
 It's like an encounter. 

00:00:34.880 --> 00:00:37.010
 Save as a r &amp; d 

00:00:37.010 --> 00:00:40.010

 It's entertainment. 

00:01:00.790 --> 00:01:03.790
 It means the investigation agency. 

00:01:04.320 --> 00:01:05.530
 An urgent day 

00:01:05.530 --> 00:01:08.530
 I did not threaten. So, even if you crack down 

00:01:09.800 --> 00:01:13.870
 I have come across the idea of â€‹â€‹expanding that there is nothing wrong with securing it. 

00:01:13.870 --> 00:01:15.040
 result 

00:01:15.040 --> 00:01:18.040

 Although soft and long 

00:01:29.350 --> 00:01:33.439
 The entire face. So it gets a little bit faster. 

00:01:34.430 --> 00:01:37.060
 At first glance 

00:01:37.060 --> 00:01:39.300
 it for it. 

00:01:39.300 --> 00:01:40.820
 Why? 

00:01:40.820 --> 00:01:42.890
 Especially in summer 

00:01:42.890 --> 00:01:45.890
 Helping to advance into society 

00:01:46.540 --> 00:01:49.800
 Because it requires knowledge of 

00:01:49.800 --> 00:01:53.140

 In addition to being able to take 4 hours of classes, 

00:02:08.080 --> 00:02:12.360
 There may be compensation for the essence and two consecutive shifts 

00:02:12.360 --> 00:02:15.329
 The moon will rise. 

00:02:15.329 --> 00:02:17.899

 It is a matter of foreign currency funds. 

00:02:40.549 --> 00:02:41.349
 At the end of treatment 

00:02:41.349 --> 00:02:44.349
 Stating why it is necessary 

00:02:45.959 --> 00:02:48.959

 He said he had a corporate bond. 

00:03:04.049 --> 00:03:05.469
 Water representative 

00:03:05.469 --> 00:03:08.269

 On the head of Klein Herd 

00:03:21.729 --> 00:03:24.529
 It's an existing product and it's different. 

00:03:24.529 --> 00:03:27.479
 Oh, it was. 

00:03:27.479 --> 00:03:30.479
 Nexen Tire Eyewear co. 

00:03:31.959 --> 00:03:32.809
 During the sale period 

00:03:32.809 --> 00:03:35.510
 The king and I seem to have fallen. 

00:03:35.510 --> 00:03:38.510
 But this is po. 

00:03:39.509 --> 00:03:42.019
 What you need to do is 

00:03:42.019 --> 00:03:42.729
 Keep it. 

00:03:42.729 --> 00:03:44.819
 There are some press 

00:03:44.819 --> 00:03:47.819
 When the force is damaged, the national problem 

00:03:48.810 --> 00:03:50.129
 It's important to lose. 

00:03:50.129 --> 00:03:53.529
 But when it gets worse, the book is hanging on the law of the company that can 

00:03:54.329 --> 00:03:57.930
 The most important thing is that it is released without stress 

00:03:57.930 --> 00:03:59.189
