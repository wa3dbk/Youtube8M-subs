rabbit<00:00:27.000> dubbing<00:00:27.330> give<00:00:27.539> me<00:00:27.660> just<00:00:28.019> a<00:00:28.109> rough<00:00:28.410> idea

00:00:28.849 --> 00:00:28.859 
rabbit dubbing give me just a rough idea

00:00:28.859 --> 00:00:32.540 
rabbit dubbing give me just a rough idea
of<00:00:29.390> what<00:00:30.390> you<00:00:30.539> can<00:00:30.630> do<00:00:30.779> with<00:00:30.900> this<00:00:31.019> machine<00:00:31.550> so

00:00:32.540 --> 00:00:32.550 
of what you can do with this machine so

00:00:32.550 --> 00:00:35.930 
of what you can do with this machine so
first<00:00:32.910> next<00:00:33.329> step<00:00:33.690> is<00:00:33.930> you<00:00:34.710> insert<00:00:35.070> the<00:00:35.670> pin

00:00:35.930 --> 00:00:35.940 
first next step is you insert the pin

that<00:00:36.120> holds<00:00:36.270> the<00:00:36.480> tray<00:00:36.690> up<00:00:37.399> and<00:00:38.399> then<00:00:39.149> we

00:00:39.639 --> 00:00:39.649 
that holds the tray up and then we

00:00:39.649 --> 00:00:50.210 
that holds the tray up and then we
gently<00:00:42.140> get<00:00:43.140> some<00:00:43.350> tension<00:00:43.739> on<00:00:43.829> this

00:00:50.210 --> 00:00:50.220 

00:00:50.220 --> 00:00:51.920 

the<00:00:50.550> trick<00:00:50.790> meant<00:00:51.030> making<00:00:51.270> any<00:00:51.570> brushes

00:00:51.920 --> 00:00:51.930 
the trick meant making any brushes

00:00:51.930 --> 00:00:54.130

00:00:54.130 --> 00:00:54.140 
making sure that the fibers are laid

00:00:54.140 --> 00:00:57.320 
making sure that the fibers are laid
properly<00:00:55.140> with<00:00:55.500> not<00:00:55.650> about<00:00:55.860> your<00:00:56.040> clumps<00:00:56.430> like

00:00:57.320 --> 00:00:57.330 
properly with not about your clumps like

can<00:05:59.519> back<00:06:00.519> out<00:06:00.729> the<00:06:00.939> straight<00:06:01.899> pin<00:06:02.199> and<00:06:03.099> at<00:06:03.819> the

00:06:03.899 --> 00:06:03.909 
can back out the straight pin and at the

00:06:03.909 --> 00:06:05.790 
can back out the straight pin and at the
same<00:06:04.119> time<00:06:04.389> simultaneously<00:06:04.689> hit<00:06:05.439> the<00:06:05.559> motor

00:06:05.790 --> 00:06:05.800

driver<00:06:07.769> it's<00:06:08.769> a<00:06:08.830> little<00:06:09.039> tricky<00:06:09.369> first<00:06:09.729> I

00:06:09.929 --> 00:06:09.939 
driver it's a little tricky first I

00:06:09.939 --> 00:06:12.540 
driver it's a little tricky first I
think<00:06:10.199> it's<00:06:11.199> a<00:06:11.289> matter<00:06:11.499> of<00:06:11.559> practice<00:06:12.039> until<00:06:12.399> I

00:06:12.540 --> 00:06:12.550 
think it's a matter of practice until I

00:06:12.550 --> 00:06:14.129 
think it's a matter of practice until I
can<00:06:12.759> lost<00:06:12.939> a<00:06:13.089> little<00:06:13.239> bit<00:06:13.360> of<00:06:13.419> four<00:06:13.659> right<00:06:13.839> here
