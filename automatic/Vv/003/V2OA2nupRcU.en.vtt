00:00:20.510 --> 00:00:20.520 
replacing this 15 amp fuse right here

00:00:20.520 --> 00:00:23.380 
replacing this 15 amp fuse right here
and<00:00:20.730> it<00:00:20.820> worked

00:00:23.380 --> 00:00:23.390 

00:00:23.390 --> 00:00:27.490 

here's<00:00:24.390> the<00:00:24.570> diagram<00:00:24.890> and<00:00:25.890> there<00:00:26.730> it<00:00:26.849> is

00:00:27.490 --> 00:00:27.500 
here's the diagram and there it is

00:00:27.500 --> 00:00:31.310 
here's the diagram and there it is
replaced<00:00:28.500> it<00:00:28.710> and<00:00:28.800> it<00:00:29.130> worked<00:00:29.340> that<00:00:30.260> would<00:00:31.260> be

replaced it and it worked that would be

00:00:31.320 --> 00:00:37.970 
replaced it and it worked that would be
a<00:00:31.349> 15<00:00:31.769> amp<00:00:31.949> here<00:00:32.130> the<00:00:32.340> two<00:00:32.489> blown<00:00:32.790> fuses<00:00:36.950> what<00:00:37.950> I

00:00:37.970 --> 00:00:37.980 
a 15 amp here the two blown fuses what I

00:00:37.980 --> 00:00:40.670 
a 15 amp here the two blown fuses what I
did<00:00:38.250> was<00:00:38.570> the<00:00:39.570> right<00:00:39.600> wasn't<00:00:40.320> working<00:00:40.649> too

00:00:40.670 --> 00:00:40.680 
did was the right wasn't working too

00:00:40.680 --> 00:00:41.500 
did was the right wasn't working too
well<00:00:40.829> either

00:00:41.500 --> 00:00:41.510 
well either

so<00:00:42.510> I<00:00:42.570> put<00:00:42.840> in<00:00:42.960> a<00:00:43.969> new<00:00:44.969> wiring<00:00:45.239> harness<00:00:45.750> because

00:00:46.069 --> 00:00:46.079 
so I put in a new wiring harness because

00:00:46.079 --> 00:00:48.950 
so I put in a new wiring harness because
it<00:00:46.200> was<00:00:46.320> in<00:00:46.590> the<00:00:46.770> salt<00:00:47.010> water<00:00:47.600> put<00:00:48.600> that<00:00:48.780> in

00:00:48.950 --> 00:00:48.960 
it was in the salt water put that in

00:00:48.960 --> 00:00:51.619 
it was in the salt water put that in
there<00:00:49.170> I<00:00:49.489> like<00:00:50.489> these<00:00:50.610> little<00:00:50.670> extenders<00:00:51.390> for

00:00:51.619 --> 00:00:51.629 
there I like these little extenders for

00:00:51.629 --> 00:00:55.880
