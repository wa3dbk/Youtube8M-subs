00:02:20.790 --> 00:02:20.800 
even a mini surge protector like the

00:02:20.800 --> 00:02:23.340 
even a mini surge protector like the
monster<00:02:21.360> outlets<00:02:22.360> to<00:02:22.480> go<00:02:22.570> or<00:02:22.750> even<00:02:22.990> the<00:02:23.050> belkin

00:02:23.340 --> 00:02:23.350 
monster outlets to go or even the belkin

00:02:23.350 --> 00:02:25.080 
monster outlets to go or even the belkin
surge<00:02:23.560> protector<00:02:24.010> it<00:02:24.100> does<00:02:24.310> charge<00:02:24.610> over<00:02:24.940> USB

00:02:25.080 --> 00:02:25.090 
surge protector it does charge over USB

00:02:25.090 --> 00:02:27.810 
surge protector it does charge over USB
so<00:02:25.630> you<00:02:25.720> can<00:02:25.840> plug<00:02:26.020> it<00:02:26.170> in<00:02:26.260> your<00:02:26.380> laptop<00:02:26.820> into

00:02:27.810 --> 00:02:27.820 
so you can plug it in your laptop into

00:02:27.820 --> 00:02:30.870 
so you can plug it in your laptop into
your<00:02:27.970> windows<00:02:28.750> or<00:02:28.990> your<00:02:29.200> mac<00:02:29.550> laptop<00:02:30.550> or<00:02:30.850> your

home<00:02:31.450> PC<00:02:32.110> or<00:02:32.230> Mac<00:02:32.410> so<00:02:32.770> pretty<00:02:33.580> good<00:02:33.610> that<00:02:33.850> way

00:02:34.020 --> 00:02:34.030 
home PC or Mac so pretty good that way

00:02:34.030 --> 00:02:36.300 
home PC or Mac so pretty good that way
and<00:02:34.240> like<00:02:35.230> I<00:02:35.470> said<00:02:35.530> it<00:02:35.740> comes<00:02:35.890> with<00:02:36.010> the<00:02:36.040> pouch

00:02:36.300 --> 00:02:36.310 
and like I said it comes with the pouch

00:02:36.310 --> 00:02:39.750 
and like I said it comes with the pouch
and<00:02:36.630> comes<00:02:37.630> a<00:02:37.750> little<00:02:37.930> cap<00:02:38.320> to<00:02:38.770> that<00:02:39.550> goes<00:02:39.730> on

00:02:39.750 --> 00:02:39.760 
and comes a little cap to that goes on

00:02:39.760 --> 00:02:42.330 
and comes a little cap to that goes on
top<00:02:39.940> of<00:02:40.330> the<00:02:40.390> connector<00:02:40.870> here<00:02:41.080> so<00:02:41.320> you<00:02:41.800> keep<00:02:42.190> it

00:02:42.330 --> 00:02:42.340 
top of the connector here so you keep it

00:02:42.340 --> 00:02:45.120 
top of the connector here so you keep it
nice<00:02:42.460> and<00:02:42.520> clean<00:02:43.200> right<00:02:44.200> here<00:02:44.440> and<00:02:44.980> we're

00:03:14.910 --> 00:03:14.920 
a size of it is almost around the same

00:03:14.920 --> 00:03:18.090 
a size of it is almost around the same
size<00:03:16.050> if<00:03:17.050> you're<00:03:17.290> talking<00:03:17.710> about<00:03:17.830> it's<00:03:18.070> a

00:03:18.090 --> 00:03:18.100 
size if you're talking about it's a

00:03:18.100 --> 00:03:20.130 
size if you're talking about it's a
little<00:03:18.340> thicker<00:03:18.610> than<00:03:18.850> Richard<00:03:19.210> soul<00:03:19.420> 1800

00:03:20.130 --> 00:03:20.140 
little thicker than Richard soul 1800

00:03:20.140 --> 00:03:23.220 
little thicker than Richard soul 1800
that<00:03:20.230> I<00:03:20.320> had<00:03:21.300> shorter<00:03:22.300> the<00:03:22.570> thicker<00:03:22.810> so<00:03:23.080> I'm

00:03:23.220 --> 00:03:23.230 
that I had shorter the thicker so I'm

00:03:23.230 --> 00:03:25.020 
that I had shorter the thicker so I'm
assuming<00:03:23.380> even<00:03:24.310> though<00:03:24.400> it<00:03:24.490> doesn't<00:03:24.610> say<00:03:24.910> the

00:03:25.020 --> 00:03:25.030 
assuming even though it doesn't say the

00:03:25.030 --> 00:03:27.960 
assuming even though it doesn't say the
milliamps<00:03:25.710> anywhere<00:03:26.710> on<00:03:26.920> the<00:03:27.040> tech<00:03:27.340> specs

00:03:27.960 --> 00:03:27.970 
milliamps anywhere on the tech specs

00:03:27.970 --> 00:03:29.430 
milliamps anywhere on the tech specs
here<00:03:28.150> I'm<00:03:28.510> assuming<00:03:28.810> it's<00:03:28.930> around<00:03:29.080> eighteen

00:03:29.430 --> 00:03:29.440 
here I'm assuming it's around eighteen

00:03:29.440 --> 00:03:30.720 
here I'm assuming it's around eighteen
hundred<00:03:29.680> milliamps<00:03:29.890> it<00:03:30.160> should<00:03:30.310> give<00:03:30.460> you<00:03:30.550> a

00:03:30.720 --> 00:03:30.730 
hundred milliamps it should give you a

00:03:30.730 --> 00:03:33.810 
hundred milliamps it should give you a
full<00:03:31.450> charge<00:03:32.320> on<00:03:32.680> top<00:03:33.070> of<00:03:33.190> what<00:03:33.310> you<00:03:33.340> can<00:03:33.640> get

connectors on the bottom of the iphone

00:03:40.450 --> 00:03:42.540 
connectors on the bottom of the iphone
are<00:03:40.570> the<00:03:40.630> same<00:03:40.870> so<00:03:41.170> all<00:03:41.710> the<00:03:41.950> way<00:03:42.010> back<00:03:42.220> to<00:03:42.430> that
