00:00:00.370 --> 00:00:04.650
 in paschal session 

00:00:09.540 --> 00:00:14.160
 the game that concerns us in this clip was 

00:00:12.300 --> 00:00:16.800
 one of the interesting shooters for 

00:00:14.160 --> 00:00:19.040
 you were the times in which while 

00:00:16.800 --> 00:00:20.880
 most editors bar 

00:00:19.040 --> 00:00:22.770
 distributors boosted 

00:00:20.880 --> 00:00:25.470
 mainly the casual games for the 

00:00:22.770 --> 00:00:27.840
 nintendo console then he went to 

00:00:25.470 --> 00:00:30.360
 countercurrent and bet strong by 

00:00:27.840 --> 00:00:32.099
 produce something more hard games like mad 

00:00:30.360 --> 00:00:34.230
 world or this first the conduit of the 

00:00:32.099 --> 00:00:36.690
 two that were released were able to charm 

00:00:34.230 --> 00:00:38.399
 both critical and public are not 

00:00:36.690 --> 00:00:40.200
 they became as best-sellers as 

00:00:38.399 --> 00:00:42.540
 other games in this section but yes that 

00:00:40.200 --> 00:00:45.030
 they were featured products in the catalog 

00:00:42.540 --> 00:00:47.010
 from wii the conduit developed by high 

00:00:45.030 --> 00:00:49.320
 voltage software put us in the skin of 

00:00:47.010 --> 00:00:51.600
 Michael Ford an experienced agent in 

00:00:49.320 --> 00:00:53.010
 the battlefield our mission was 

00:00:51.600 --> 00:00:55.860
 try to end a dangerous 

00:00:53.010 --> 00:00:58.560
 organization called we promise your 

00:00:55.860 --> 00:01:00.780
 argument was interesting in its plot 

00:00:58.560 --> 00:01:02.910
 it was not over to finish with soldiers 

00:01:00.780 --> 00:01:04.949
 enemies and with creatures from another world 

00:01:02.910 --> 00:01:07.140
 it was just the tip of the iceberg of this 

00:01:04.949 --> 00:01:10.020
 shooter that had some puzzles 

00:01:07.140 --> 00:01:11.820
 and interesting actions many of these 

00:01:10.020 --> 00:01:13.770
 they were based on the use of a device 

00:01:11.820 --> 00:01:16.500
 called eba 

00:01:13.770 --> 00:01:18.750
 alternative display sphere 

00:01:16.500 --> 00:01:20.369
 between the actions that allowed us this 

00:01:18.750 --> 00:01:22.289
 sphere were the one to turn off 

00:01:20.369 --> 00:01:25.320
 organic devices to open 

00:01:22.289 --> 00:01:28.319
 accesses track which gps the route to 

00:01:25.320 --> 00:01:31.319
 continue to discover invisible enemies like this 

00:01:28.319 --> 00:01:32.610
 as secret areas among others the 

00:01:31.319 --> 00:01:34.890
 amount of weapons we had 

00:01:32.610 --> 00:01:36.119
 access because it was high exchanging 

00:01:34.890 --> 00:01:38.219
 any of the two weapons that 

00:01:36.119 --> 00:01:40.409
 we were carrying for anyone who 

00:01:38.219 --> 00:01:42.179
 let's find our way too 

00:01:40.409 --> 00:01:44.909
 we had grenades and other weapons 

00:01:42.179 --> 00:01:47.360
 thrown when this product came out to 

00:01:44.909 --> 00:01:49.649
 the sale still did not exist wiimote plus 

00:01:47.360 --> 00:01:51.750
 accessory that improved sensitivity 

00:01:49.649 --> 00:01:53.399
 of the wiimote so you take the 

00:01:51.750 --> 00:01:56.009
 Quiet and be precise in our 

00:01:53.399 --> 00:01:58.380
 shots by required a little bit of 

00:01:56.009 --> 00:02:00.119
 practice luckily we could mark the 

00:01:58.380 --> 00:02:02.700
 desired goal to have a greater 

00:02:00.119 --> 00:02:05.189
 effectiveness in our shots some 

00:02:02.700 --> 00:02:07.829
 scenarios were a few xosÃ© test in 

00:02:05.189 --> 00:02:10.049
 as to design but in general all 

00:02:07.829 --> 00:02:12.269
 they presented an interesting finish that 

00:02:10.049 --> 00:02:14.519
 reflected the atmosphere of the game with a 

00:02:12.269 --> 00:02:15.880
 air to area 51 that we have always been 

00:02:14.519 --> 00:02:17.980
 taught in movies 

00:02:15.880 --> 00:02:20.710
 secret agencies armed soldiers 

00:02:17.980 --> 00:02:22.120
 creatures from another planet portals the 

00:02:20.710 --> 00:02:24.280
 atmosphere was one of its main 

00:02:22.120 --> 00:02:26.590
 tricks with areas that placed us well in 

00:02:24.280 --> 00:02:28.840
 the action and gave coherent step to the 

00:02:26.590 --> 00:02:31.090
 following counting on good enemies 

00:02:28.840 --> 00:02:33.940
 designed and represented in each of 

00:02:31.090 --> 00:02:37.570
 the ones behind them presented a daughter 

00:02:33.940 --> 00:02:39.670
 correct without fanfare and always appeared 

00:02:37.570 --> 00:02:41.320
 in the same places so yes 

00:02:39.670 --> 00:02:42.940
 we died or it was just a matter of 

00:02:41.320 --> 00:02:46.270
 memorize your distribution in the 

00:02:42.940 --> 00:02:49.120
 scenario and continue palante aspect 

00:02:46.270 --> 00:02:51.040
 criticism of an approximate duration of 

00:02:49.120 --> 00:02:52.960
 about ten hours although some 

00:02:51.040 --> 00:02:55.150
 relate less and with a lot of 

00:02:52.960 --> 00:02:58.120
 secrets to discover the conduit it 

00:02:55.150 --> 00:03:00.100
 complemented with a multiplayer modes 

00:02:58.120 --> 00:03:01.900
 as all against all confrontation 

00:03:00.100 --> 00:03:03.940
 by teams or fight for the eba were 

00:03:01.900 --> 00:03:05.740
 some of them the second delivery 

00:03:03.940 --> 00:03:07.600
 came a while later improving the 

00:03:05.740 --> 00:03:10.120
 small defects and enhancing the 

00:03:07.600 --> 00:03:12.220
 positive it was more round than the 

00:03:10.120 --> 00:03:14.410
 first in all the senses although already 

00:03:12.220 --> 00:03:16.570
 it was not as fresh as the original 

00:03:14.410 --> 00:03:18.790
 in 2013 a version was released 

00:03:16.570 --> 00:03:21.280
 updated hd of the first the conduit 

00:03:18.790 --> 00:03:23.500
 for mobile devices and tablets 

00:03:21.280 --> 00:03:25.920
 and in the next 100 session history and 

00:03:23.500 --> 00:03:28.920
 by popular demand we remember the 

00:03:25.920 --> 00:03:28.920
 Godfather
