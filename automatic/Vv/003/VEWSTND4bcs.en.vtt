this<00:02:51.960> just<00:02:52.620> comes<00:02:52.830> off<00:02:53.040> by<00:02:53.540> prying<00:02:54.540> down<00:02:54.780> on<00:02:54.960> a

00:02:54.980 --> 00:02:54.990 
this just comes off by prying down on a

00:02:54.990 --> 00:03:00.800 
this just comes off by prying down on a
tab<00:02:55.290> here<00:02:57.110> and<00:02:58.110> out<00:02:58.850> and<00:02:59.850> if<00:03:00.060> you<00:03:00.210> do<00:03:00.390> use<00:03:00.630> this
