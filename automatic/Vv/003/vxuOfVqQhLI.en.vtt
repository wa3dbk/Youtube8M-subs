00:00:25.170 --> 00:00:31.740

00:00:27.000 --> 00:00:44.879
 not just so that's me 

00:00:31.740 --> 00:00:47.039
 cool we go first we can see that he 

00:00:44.879 --> 00:01:00.090
 happened be stealth a rabbit that 

00:00:47.039 --> 00:01:06.470
 will soon be fondled for a long time and the 

00:01:00.090 --> 00:01:06.470
 preacher has gone through these debates and 

00:01:08.270 --> 00:01:13.020
 especially so you 'll see it's like 

00:01:11.610 --> 00:01:16.080
 that but not only 

00:01:13.020 --> 00:01:18.000
 under his throat and 18 like this and you 

00:01:16.080 --> 00:01:19.890
 give his paw when he is with 

00:01:18.000 --> 00:01:20.520
 the other one so there will only be good 

00:01:19.890 --> 00:01:23.549
 like that 

00:01:20.520 --> 00:01:26.670
 and that's how nathan rogues and 

00:01:23.549 --> 00:01:30.780
 with your big fingers you go to bread 

00:01:26.670 --> 00:01:34.020
 early take continuous brand 

00:01:30.780 --> 00:01:37.020
 like that and stuck the paws and the 

00:01:34.020 --> 00:01:40.740
 spur how out we get around 

00:01:37.020 --> 00:01:42.360
 of your finger and take it like this 

00:01:40.740 --> 00:01:44.450
 is well tested the package on this 

00:01:42.360 --> 00:01:47.659
 sad 

00:01:44.450 --> 00:01:50.360
 like that everything is the first solution 

00:01:47.659 --> 00:01:52.250
 the workshop then already it's when your 

00:01:50.360 --> 00:01:55.039
 rabbit he does not struggle he is very 

00:01:52.250 --> 00:01:56.679
 nice to you but sometimes you do not 

00:01:55.039 --> 00:02:00.710
 do not know exactly how to wear it 

00:01:56.679 --> 00:02:02.210
 so it's the median it's easier 

00:02:00.710 --> 00:02:04.810
 when one sees this rabbit not develop 

00:02:02.210 --> 00:02:09.580
 when come to read our article 

00:02:04.810 --> 00:02:12.260
 so here if it was necessary to redo are 

00:02:09.580 --> 00:02:16.690
 always caress him and before 

00:02:12.260 --> 00:02:16.690
 to wear well they must feel you 

00:02:17.349 --> 00:02:23.959
 so already what you can do already 

00:02:20.060 --> 00:02:29.739
 first this is how 

00:02:23.959 --> 00:02:29.739
 this good go much faster than 

00:02:32.170 --> 00:02:36.829
 third 

00:02:33.849 --> 00:02:38.540
 the lava content lkp it's always 

00:02:36.829 --> 00:02:39.829
 always before taking his plumb 

00:02:38.540 --> 00:02:41.480
 forever the people of Cairo and 

00:02:39.829 --> 00:02:43.519
 that's why once 

00:02:41.480 --> 00:02:52.760
 trophy is to know that he is in 

00:02:43.519 --> 00:02:54.799
 trust and everything where you go so 

00:02:52.760 --> 00:02:57.760
 or so when he's really struggling 

00:02:54.799 --> 00:03:01.880
 as you normally take it you throw 

00:02:57.760 --> 00:03:03.380
 with a caress aside as what the 

00:03:01.880 --> 00:03:04.549
 debate by when it's struggling you're 

00:03:03.380 --> 00:03:06.950
 obliged to make them two points of 

00:03:04.549 --> 00:03:10.639
 caresses and we have it when I see 

00:03:06.950 --> 00:03:14.810
 really not at all like me for a 

00:03:10.639 --> 00:03:19.569
 caress and hop I take you like that 

00:03:14.810 --> 00:03:19.569
 and here you are in my arms 

00:03:27.670 --> 00:03:35.510
 I would also like the doors and 

00:03:30.560 --> 00:03:38.180
 binary I was even right away so 

00:03:35.510 --> 00:03:40.490
 it's like Montreal's second that I 

00:03:38.180 --> 00:03:44.500
 will show you the teeth rather the 

00:03:40.490 --> 00:03:50.210
 third so you car it and that's fine 

00:03:44.500 --> 00:03:52.850
 you're going to take it like this 

00:03:50.210 --> 00:03:54.250
 place the vote in your case where that for 

00:03:52.850 --> 00:04:01.760
 I did not find 

00:03:54.250 --> 00:04:04.940
 and here we have taken the week as 

00:04:01.760 --> 00:04:06.170
 the games I wanted to put in his 

00:04:04.940 --> 00:04:08.350
 cage because he's a little fed up 

00:04:06.170 --> 00:04:12.070
 from everyone 

00:04:08.350 --> 00:04:12.070
 here is a big kiss
