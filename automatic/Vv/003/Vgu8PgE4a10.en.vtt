00:00:02.010 --> 00:00:04.460
 the man he would tested with 

00:00:04.460 --> 00:00:06.200
 and thereby 

00:00:06.200 --> 00:00:09.200
 years he was not doing well at all 

00:00:10.029 --> 00:00:12.759
 when i was nine problems to life 

00:00:12.759 --> 00:00:15.759
 the man's engines is of course not good and that's why I'm here 

00:00:16.519 --> 00:00:19.519
 it was intended to survive 

00:00:20.289 --> 00:00:23.659
 yes we live abroad 

00:00:23.659 --> 00:00:26.409
 both agree 

00:00:26.409 --> 00:00:28.390
 some of them survived 

00:00:28.390 --> 00:00:31.390
 one of the twelve rounds 

00:00:37.470 --> 00:00:39.020
 the handheld 

00:00:39.020 --> 00:00:41.550
 not to teach people to agree with him 

00:00:41.550 --> 00:00:45.649
 but there to solve the problems together with them and with the help of god 

00:00:45.649 --> 00:00:48.789
 everyone can be helped every person young 

00:00:49.630 --> 00:00:50.749
 it makes sense 

00:00:50.749 --> 00:00:53.749
 and healthy living possible 

00:00:55.730 --> 00:00:57.810
 the increasing reason to start using 

00:00:57.810 --> 00:00:59.310
 and what do you think yourself 

00:00:59.310 --> 00:01:01.720
 was nothing to stop hommen 

00:01:01.720 --> 00:01:05.030
 we needed strangers but I was not there 

00:01:05.030 --> 00:01:08.850
 and the more pinned the thought needed the known, the more I went 

00:01:08.850 --> 00:01:11.200
 use 

00:01:11.200 --> 00:01:14.570
 the hope that children are teenagers and adults with problems 

00:01:14.570 --> 00:01:17.170
 children who are struggling for example because of the separation of their 

00:01:17.170 --> 00:01:17.910
 parents 

00:01:17.910 --> 00:01:20.320
 or ten who can no longer live at home 

00:01:20.320 --> 00:01:22.800
 adults and young people who have become addicted 

00:01:22.800 --> 00:01:24.950
 or who are depressed or lonely 

00:01:24.950 --> 00:01:26.969
 partners also helps children 

00:01:26.969 --> 00:01:28.340
 and parents of addicts 

00:01:28.340 --> 00:01:31.340
 by the individual conversations 

00:01:32.120 --> 00:01:33.540
 leave the old 

00:01:33.540 --> 00:01:35.120
 the trainings at the world 

00:01:35.120 --> 00:01:39.680
 and the refusals to put some people off releasing liverpool 

00:01:39.680 --> 00:01:41.440
 left 

00:01:41.440 --> 00:01:44.490
 and then it no longer failed 

00:01:44.490 --> 00:01:47.030
 one in two clinics for children and adolescents 

00:01:47.030 --> 00:01:50.670
 the kill is for children and adolescents with psychiatric problems and then you 

00:01:50.670 --> 00:01:53.600
 to be you for young people aged 12 and over with an addiction problem 

00:01:53.600 --> 00:01:56.600
 also great just lost a few women could that 

00:01:57.110 --> 00:02:00.940
 the great talent that I thought was very important that however its not possible 

00:02:00.940 --> 00:02:01.780
 work 

00:02:01.780 --> 00:02:05.200
 Hundreds of children each month became Chris's telephone helpline 

00:02:05.200 --> 00:02:07.939
 a part of child and youth care 

00:02:07.939 --> 00:02:11.030
 call children with questions about, for example, bullying for sexuality 

00:02:12.259 --> 00:02:15.259
 children cannot even come for conversations 

00:02:15.919 --> 00:02:19.379
 it has been tasty for our son 

00:02:19.379 --> 00:02:24.239
 if we look back here and then if you know that he is more resilient 

00:02:24.239 --> 00:02:25.809
 become 

00:02:25.809 --> 00:02:27.069
 acknowledge that he 

00:02:27.069 --> 00:02:30.840
 in certain situations and yes he says he can control better 

00:02:32.019 --> 00:02:35.010
 the help that best suits someone is determined according to the intake interviews 

00:02:35.010 --> 00:02:39.090
 this can be unique or part-time treatment in a daycare conversation 

00:02:39.090 --> 00:02:40.339
 assisted living 

00:02:40.339 --> 00:02:43.769
 the center for pastoral counseling is also part of our work 

00:02:43.769 --> 00:02:47.759
 here people with psychosocial problems can get help in the form of 

00:02:47.759 --> 00:02:49.189
 ambulatory conversations 

00:02:49.189 --> 00:02:53.129
 the cpz also offers pastoral care and various courses, for example 

00:02:53.129 --> 00:02:56.119
 pastors eldest and pastoral workers 

00:02:56.119 --> 00:02:59.149
 after treatment there are various forms of aftercare 

00:02:59.149 --> 00:03:01.629
 counseling interviews or self-help groups 

00:03:01.629 --> 00:03:05.010
 also has hope in that house with a special program for ex addicts 

00:03:05.010 --> 00:03:06.579
 then also wanted to come 

00:03:06.579 --> 00:03:10.059
 in a last year guilty towards a son versus the family one 

00:03:10.059 --> 00:03:12.879
 opposite god 

00:03:12.879 --> 00:03:16.079
 yes I have you walk in a larger VVV is possible 

00:03:16.849 --> 00:03:18.769
 I could be won 

00:03:18.769 --> 00:03:22.469
 But the wonderful percent is also equipped with sensors like me 

00:03:22.469 --> 00:03:23.610
 had done 

00:03:23.610 --> 00:03:26.759
 nonetheless, people want to be able to deliver as quickly as possible 

00:03:26.759 --> 00:03:29.739
 the treatment of hope is therefore clearly focused on the future 

00:03:29.739 --> 00:03:33.049
 he can just be lazy rarely is done in faith you have the freedom to 

00:03:33.049 --> 00:03:34.529
 working valley 

00:03:34.529 --> 00:03:37.779
 You can tell that they are one step higher 

00:03:37.779 --> 00:03:43.419
 I felt very important for the future to go to the website 

00:03:43.419 --> 00:03:46.419
 had made up the problems with liquor 

00:03:47.189 --> 00:03:50.189
 a premier debate of the winner to another channel 

00:03:50.729 --> 00:03:53.609
 The world has a large number within the company 

00:03:53.609 --> 00:03:56.609
 the people must be 

00:03:58.229 --> 00:04:02.739
 yes I have come out because a work experience place 

00:04:03.239 --> 00:04:04.949
 can be fun 

00:04:04.949 --> 00:04:09.689
 relationship with your hands are busy the face are busy but beautiful things 

00:04:09.689 --> 00:04:12.809
 sees all the result it is that people with young children 

00:04:13.319 --> 00:04:14.839
 can turn to the height 

00:04:14.839 --> 00:04:17.529
 the children can live with hope with the pope 

00:04:17.529 --> 00:04:20.859
 during the day they go to boom dynamite baits daycare center of hope and the 

00:04:20.859 --> 00:04:24.050
 parents receive walking training in the field of education 

00:04:24.050 --> 00:04:25.710
 during the day at the townhouse euro 

00:04:25.710 --> 00:04:28.099
 if there is also more to train 

00:04:28.099 --> 00:04:29.340
 and work there 

00:04:29.340 --> 00:04:32.730
 Furthermore, there is also a single tablet that your other friends believe 

00:04:32.730 --> 00:04:34.340
 peers and 

00:04:34.340 --> 00:04:35.969
 I really enjoy it 

00:04:35.969 --> 00:04:38.980
 many of the problems of the people who have been included in hope 

00:04:38.980 --> 00:04:42.850
 could have been prevented, therefore prevention is an important activity of 

00:04:42.850 --> 00:04:43.659
 hope 

00:04:43.659 --> 00:04:47.509
 Prevention staff from the hope of the clean youth and the beat every day 

00:04:47.509 --> 00:04:48.639
 take away the old one 

00:04:48.639 --> 00:04:51.909
 defense employees provide information about alcohol and drugs 

00:04:51.909 --> 00:04:54.909
 and encourage young people to opt for an unhealthy lifestyle 

00:04:56.900 --> 00:04:59.759
 Eindhoven has a clear warning 

00:04:59.759 --> 00:05:02.669
 he was written his name 

00:05:02.669 --> 00:05:05.069
 people can volunteer to go smoothly 

00:05:05.069 --> 00:05:07.360
 reserve tickets 

00:05:07.360 --> 00:05:10.360
 that it is a commission 

00:05:13.659 --> 00:05:16.249
 not 

00:05:16.249 --> 00:05:19.300
 the most beautiful by the church was the bible 

00:05:19.300 --> 00:05:22.300
 it is nothing of the ax that never read and the accompanying 

00:05:22.800 --> 00:05:25.490
 I don't understand what it said 

00:05:25.490 --> 00:05:28.229
 what has changed now is me 

00:05:28.229 --> 00:05:30.650

00:05:30.650 --> 00:05:33.189

00:05:39.469 --> 00:05:41.339
 to open up 

00:05:41.339 --> 00:05:43.469
 my feeling is that they show 

00:05:43.469 --> 00:05:46.589
 it would even be happy in the presence of others I dare not 

00:05:49.330 --> 00:05:52.330
 become who i get at 

00:05:54.900 --> 00:05:56.650
