00:04:59.450 --> 00:04:59.460 
rotatable don't know if you knew that

00:04:59.460 --> 00:05:01.700 
rotatable don't know if you knew that
about<00:04:59.700> this<00:05:00.030> it<00:05:00.960> would<00:05:01.140> be<00:05:01.290> cool<00:05:01.500> if<00:05:01.530> the

00:05:03.290 --> 00:05:03.300 
battery was inside it because as soon as

00:05:03.300 --> 00:05:05.330 
battery was inside it because as soon as
you<00:05:03.419> open<00:05:03.450> it<00:05:03.780> up<00:05:03.900> and<00:05:04.140> turn<00:05:04.260> on<00:05:04.500> you<00:05:05.160> could

00:05:05.330 --> 00:05:05.340 
you open it up and turn on you could

00:05:05.340 --> 00:05:07.040 
you open it up and turn on you could
start<00:05:05.640> having<00:05:05.760> a<00:05:05.940> bit<00:05:06.060> by<00:05:06.180> playing<00:05:06.419> my<00:05:06.750> sort<00:05:07.020> of

thing know that it takes much to power
battery<00:05:09.210> into<00:05:09.330> the<00:05:09.450> actual

00:05:09.810 --> 00:05:09.820 
battery into the actual

00:05:09.820 --> 00:05:12.450 
battery into the actual
vice<00:05:10.030> but<00:05:10.500> yeah<00:05:11.500> that's<00:05:11.860> just<00:05:11.980> one<00:05:12.220> thing<00:05:12.250> I

00:05:12.450 --> 00:05:12.460 
vice but yeah that's just one thing I

love<00:05:12.610> to<00:05:12.640> do<00:05:12.850> as<00:05:12.940> soon<00:05:13.090> as<00:05:13.180> I'll<00:05:13.270> get<00:05:13.390> a<00:05:13.450> device

00:05:13.770 --> 00:05:13.780 
love to do as soon as I'll get a device

00:05:13.780 --> 00:05:16.020 
love to do as soon as I'll get a device
you<00:05:14.080> know<00:05:14.230> it's<00:05:14.410> switch<00:05:14.680> on<00:05:14.980> as<00:05:15.640> soon<00:05:15.850> as<00:05:15.940> it

00:05:16.020 --> 00:05:16.030 
you know it's switch on as soon as it

00:05:16.030 --> 00:05:21.660 
you know it's switch on as soon as it
comes<00:05:16.180> out<00:05:16.300> the<00:05:16.390> box<00:05:19.410> okay<00:05:20.410> so<00:05:20.890> everything

00:05:21.660 --> 00:05:21.670 
comes out the box okay so everything

00:05:21.670 --> 00:05:25.080 
comes out the box okay so everything
that<00:05:21.850> comes<00:05:22.150> with<00:05:22.690> the<00:05:23.140> canon<00:05:23.590> eos<00:05:24.070> 600d

00:05:25.080 --> 00:05:25.090

00:05:31.290 --> 00:05:31.300 
and I will probably do a separate video

00:05:31.300 --> 00:05:33.750 
and I will probably do a separate video
soon<00:05:31.900> about<00:05:32.650> the<00:05:32.710> actual<00:05:33.040> workings<00:05:33.460> of<00:05:33.610> the

soon about the actual workings of the
device<00:05:34.060> and<00:05:34.390> stuff<00:05:34.660> like<00:05:34.780> that<00:05:34.960> once<00:05:35.170> I

00:05:35.310 --> 00:05:35.320 
device and stuff like that once I
