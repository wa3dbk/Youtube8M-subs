00:01:22.550 --> 00:01:22.560 
does this right here hits 440 and you

00:01:22.560 --> 00:01:24.950 
does this right here hits 440 and you
can<00:01:22.740> continue<00:01:23.040> it<00:01:23.420> instead<00:01:24.420> of<00:01:24.479> it<00:01:24.659> just<00:01:24.810> like

00:01:24.950 --> 00:01:24.960 
can continue it instead of it just like

00:01:24.960 --> 00:01:29.120 
can continue it instead of it just like
ending<00:01:25.500> right<00:01:25.680> there<00:01:27.560> it<00:01:28.560> just<00:01:28.799> keeps<00:01:28.979> going

00:01:29.120 --> 00:01:29.130 
ending right there it just keeps going

00:01:29.130 --> 00:01:31.730 
ending right there it just keeps going
infinitely<00:01:29.759> it<00:01:30.090> looks<00:01:30.240> like<00:01:30.420> so<00:01:31.380> that's<00:01:31.560> gonna

00:01:31.730 --> 00:01:31.740 
infinitely it looks like so that's gonna

00:01:31.740 --> 00:01:33.560 
infinitely it looks like so that's gonna
be<00:01:31.829> probably<00:01:32.460> his<00:01:32.579> run<00:01:32.880> no<00:01:33.119> it<00:01:33.210> doesn't<00:01:33.450> go

00:01:33.560 --> 00:01:33.570 
be probably his run no it doesn't go

00:01:33.570 --> 00:01:35.120 
be probably his run no it doesn't go
infinitely<00:01:33.960> but<00:01:34.229> it<00:01:34.350> goes<00:01:34.500> for<00:01:34.740> a<00:01:34.770> pretty<00:01:34.979> long

00:01:35.120 --> 00:01:35.130 
infinitely but it goes for a pretty long

00:01:35.130 --> 00:01:36.800 
infinitely but it goes for a pretty long
time<00:01:35.240> alright<00:01:36.240> in<00:01:36.360> the<00:01:36.420> second<00:01:36.689> upgrade

00:01:36.800 --> 00:01:36.810 
time alright in the second upgrade

00:01:36.810 --> 00:01:38.690 
time alright in the second upgrade
that's<00:01:37.049> called<00:01:37.290> built<00:01:37.590> tough<00:01:37.860> health<00:01:38.549> is

00:01:38.690 --> 00:01:38.700 
that's called built tough health is

00:01:38.700 --> 00:01:40.910 
that's called built tough health is
increased<00:01:39.170> probably<00:01:40.170> from<00:01:40.380> punching<00:01:40.799> the

00:01:40.910 --> 00:01:40.920 
increased probably from punching the

00:01:40.920 --> 00:01:45.440 
increased probably from punching the

00:02:03.280 --> 00:02:03.290 
prestonby is how you do the tans on how

00:02:03.290 --> 00:02:04.900 
prestonby is how you do the tans on how
you<00:02:03.350> like<00:02:03.590> smash<00:02:03.890> your<00:02:04.070> fists<00:02:04.400> that's<00:02:04.670> called

00:02:04.900 --> 00:02:04.910 
you like smash your fists that's called

00:02:04.910 --> 00:02:07.900 
you like smash your fists that's called
the<00:02:05.000> tantrum<00:02:05.420> so<00:02:06.250> let's<00:02:07.250> look<00:02:07.430> and<00:02:07.550> see<00:02:07.610> what

00:02:07.900 --> 00:02:07.910 
the tantrum so let's look and see what

00:02:07.910 --> 00:02:12.730 
the tantrum so let's look and see what
does<00:02:08.090> now<00:02:08.330> at<00:02:09.200> 24<00:02:09.729> and<00:02:10.729> when<00:02:10.850> I<00:02:10.910> heat<00:02:11.120> it<00:02:11.240> up<00:02:11.740> 24

00:02:12.730 --> 00:02:12.740 
does now at 24 and when I heat it up 24

00:02:12.740 --> 00:02:16.870 
does now at 24 and when I heat it up 24
in<00:02:12.800> 36<00:02:13.540> that's<00:02:14.540> up<00:02:14.870> before<00:02:15.290> it<00:02:15.470> was<00:02:15.620> 18<00:02:16.100> and<00:02:16.460> I

00:02:16.870 --> 00:02:16.880 
in 36 that's up before it was 18 and I

00:02:16.880 --> 00:02:20.950 
in 36 that's up before it was 18 and I
think<00:02:17.090> 20<00:02:17.570> I<00:02:17.870> think<00:02:18.320> it<00:02:18.470> was<00:02:18.650> 18<00:02:18.920> and<00:02:19.280> 27<00:02:20.030> so

00:02:20.950 --> 00:02:20.960 
think 20 I think it was 18 and 27 so

00:02:20.960 --> 00:02:23.200 
think 20 I think it was 18 and 27 so
when<00:02:21.080> it<00:02:21.200> first<00:02:21.350> refers<00:02:21.890> to<00:02:21.920> the<00:02:22.250> reigns<00:02:22.940> of

00:02:23.200 --> 00:02:23.210 
when it first refers to the reigns of

when it first refers to the reigns of
the<00:02:23.420> attack<00:02:23.690> bigger<00:02:24.230> this<00:02:25.100> is<00:02:25.280> an<00:02:25.400> area<00:02:25.760> of

00:02:25.810 --> 00:02:25.820 
the attack bigger this is an area of

00:02:25.820 --> 00:02:28.090 
the attack bigger this is an area of
effect<00:02:25.970> so<00:02:26.450> you<00:02:26.510> see<00:02:26.900> the<00:02:27.200> Sheep<00:02:27.440> got<00:02:27.650> hit<00:02:27.860> and

a big boost alright the first upgrade
for<00:03:24.200> this<00:03:24.320> path<00:03:24.530> is<00:03:24.709> called<00:03:24.860> hot<00:03:25.130> hands<00:03:25.400> it's

00:03:25.690 --> 00:03:25.700 
for this path is called hot hands it's

00:03:25.700 --> 00:03:27.790 
for this path is called hot hands it's
hold<00:03:25.970> X<00:03:26.209> to<00:03:26.360> rapidly<00:03:26.720> punch<00:03:27.019> nearby<00:03:27.380> enemies

00:03:30.009 --> 00:03:30.019 
in and release heat all right so let's

00:03:30.019 --> 00:03:32.050 
in and release heat all right so let's
check<00:03:30.050> that<00:03:30.170> out<00:03:30.440> so<00:03:31.040> if<00:03:31.190> you're<00:03:31.340> unheated<00:03:31.730> and

00:03:32.050 --> 00:03:32.060 
check that out so if you're unheated and

00:03:32.060 --> 00:03:34.300 
check that out so if you're unheated and
just<00:03:32.269> go<00:03:32.390> up<00:03:32.540> and<00:03:32.690> hold<00:03:32.870> down<00:03:32.989> X<00:03:33.260> you<00:03:33.440> get<00:03:33.560> 14

00:03:34.300 --> 00:03:34.310 
just go up and hold down X you get 14

00:03:34.310 --> 00:03:38.259 
just go up and hold down X you get 14
and<00:03:34.640> I<00:03:35.120> created<00:03:35.390> 26<00:03:36.940> it<00:03:37.940> has<00:03:38.060> a<00:03:38.090> lot<00:03:38.239> of

00:03:38.259 --> 00:03:38.269 
and I created 26 it has a lot of

00:03:38.269 --> 00:03:40.479 
and I created 26 it has a lot of
punching<00:03:38.660> really<00:03:38.900> fast<00:03:39.140> but<00:03:39.920> if<00:03:40.010> you<00:03:40.070> do<00:03:40.220> heat

00:03:40.479 --> 00:03:40.489 
punching really fast but if you do heat

00:03:40.489 --> 00:03:42.160 
punching really fast but if you do heat
it<00:03:40.670> so<00:03:41.239> it<00:03:41.330> looks<00:03:41.480> like<00:03:41.630> you<00:03:41.720> get<00:03:41.810> a<00:03:41.870> critical

00:03:42.160 --> 00:03:42.170 
it so it looks like you get a critical

00:03:42.170 --> 00:03:44.560 
it so it looks like you get a critical
hit<00:03:42.470> at<00:03:42.680> the<00:03:42.890> beginning<00:03:43.160> every<00:03:43.459> time<00:03:43.670> I<00:03:43.940> got<00:03:44.510> a

00:03:44.560 --> 00:03:44.570 
hit at the beginning every time I got a

00:03:44.570 --> 00:03:46.800 
hit at the beginning every time I got a

let's try the extra heated rope wait

00:04:50.460 --> 00:04:53.070 
let's try the extra heated rope wait
this<00:04:51.460> is<00:04:51.580> a<00:04:51.610> solo<00:04:51.970> gym<00:04:52.240> ability<00:04:52.660> on<00:04:52.780> top<00:04:52.960> of

00:04:53.070 --> 00:04:53.080 
this is a solo gym ability on top of

00:04:53.080 --> 00:04:56.400 
this is a solo gym ability on top of
everything<00:04:53.260> else<00:04:54.450> so<00:04:55.450> this<00:04:55.990> right<00:04:56.170> here<00:04:56.230> is

00:04:56.400 --> 00:04:56.410 
everything else so this right here is

00:04:56.410 --> 00:04:57.900 
everything else so this right here is
hitting<00:04:56.680> four<00:04:56.830> tendons<00:04:57.010> to<00:04:57.250> the<00:04:57.310> two<00:04:57.520> or<00:04:57.640> three

00:04:57.900 --> 00:04:57.910 
hitting four tendons to the two or three

00:04:57.910 --> 00:05:00.300 
hitting four tendons to the two or three
so<00:04:58.570> really<00:04:58.750> the<00:04:58.960> soldier<00:04:59.350> mobility<00:04:59.830> looks

00:05:00.300 --> 00:05:00.310 
so really the soldier mobility looks

00:05:00.310 --> 00:05:02.400 
so really the soldier mobility looks
like<00:05:00.460> it's<00:05:00.610> only<00:05:00.760> affecting<00:05:01.330> the<00:05:01.360> the<00:05:01.960> tantrum

00:05:02.400 --> 00:05:02.410 
like it's only affecting the the tantrum

00:05:02.410 --> 00:05:06.090 
like it's only affecting the the tantrum
so<00:05:03.370> it<00:05:03.850> increases<00:05:04.210> your<00:05:04.390> tantrum<00:05:05.140> ability<00:05:05.590> so

00:05:06.090 --> 00:05:06.100 
so it increases your tantrum ability so

00:05:06.100 --> 00:05:07.230 
so it increases your tantrum ability so
I'm<00:05:06.160> not<00:05:06.310> sure<00:05:06.460> what<00:05:06.610> it<00:05:06.670> does<00:05:06.730> on<00:05:06.940> the<00:05:07.060> other

00:05:07.230 --> 00:05:07.240
