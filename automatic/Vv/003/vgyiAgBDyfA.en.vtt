 home bar which also has the gsl545nsqz section 

00:00:23.310 --> 00:00:27.630
 So why this lg refrigerator now the 

00:00:26.670 --> 00:00:30.240
 design 

00:00:27.630 --> 00:00:32.669
 because that looks very tight he 

00:00:30.240 --> 00:00:34.680
 is now really big game goes really 

00:00:32.669 --> 00:00:36.050
 ridiculous amount

 and he has an ice dispenser 

00:00:36.050 --> 00:00:40.410
 he has lumps out and intervene 

00:00:38.550 --> 00:00:44.210
 also water or even 

00:00:40.410 --> 00:00:47.399
 He crashed the specifications of this 

00:00:44.210 --> 00:00:48.600
 gs500 the 45 series and content in it 

00:00:47.399 --> 00:00:52.140
 refrigerator compartment 

00:00:48.600 --> 00:00:55.829
 of 362 liters the content of it 

00:00:52.140 --> 00:00:58.649
 freezer compartment of 178 liters the height 

00:00:55.829 --> 00:00:59.760
 of this fridge is 175 comma three 

00:00:58.649 --> 00:01:02.520
 centimeters 

00:00:59.760 --> 00:01:06.420
 the width is an 89 comma four 

00:01:02.520 --> 00:01:07.830
 centimeters and the depth is 75 comma three 

00:01:06.420 --> 00:01:10.530
 centimeters 

00:01:07.830 --> 00:01:12.270
 it has energy class a plus plus what 

00:01:10.530 --> 00:01:15.180
 content 20 percent 

00:01:12.270 --> 00:01:17.729
 economical dana and this fridge consumption 

00:01:15.180 --> 00:01:20.520
 the 300 and 49 kilowatts 

00:01:17.729 --> 00:01:22.950
 electricity and converted as per year 

00:01:20.520 --> 00:01:25.229
 is 76 euros 

00:01:22.950 --> 00:01:27.689
 he also has a linear compressor 

00:01:25.229 --> 00:01:30.780
 with a 10 year warranty 

00:01:27.689 --> 00:01:32.520
 he never dissolves it and water and 

00:01:30.780 --> 00:01:34.829
 ice dispenser 

00:01:32.520 --> 00:01:39.270
 He has easy handle handles in the 

00:01:34.829 --> 00:01:39.720
 out door and space plus size system he 

00:01:39.270 --> 00:01:43.680
 has one 

00:01:39.720 --> 00:01:46.130
 nicest balance crispr and has a fresh 

00:01:43.680 --> 00:01:46.130
 so 

00:01:46.250 --> 00:01:51.420
 This LG fridge uses one 

00:01:49.229 --> 00:01:53.789
 linear compressor that is the 

00:01:51.420 --> 00:01:55.590
 engine of this refrigerator 

00:01:53.789 --> 00:01:57.329
 compared to a normal compressor 

00:01:55.590 --> 00:02:00.060
 has fewer moving parts 

00:01:57.329 --> 00:02:01.710
 there it is quieter and more economical and goes 

00:02:00.060 --> 00:02:05.659
 He will last longer and give them for 10 years 

00:02:01.710 --> 00:02:05.659
 warranty on this compressor 

00:02:06.460 --> 00:02:12.860
 this lg fridge has total no frost 

00:02:09.950 --> 00:02:14.420
 in other words, no ice formation and 

00:02:12.860 --> 00:02:15.800
 this no-frost has a number of advantages 

00:02:14.420 --> 00:02:17.629
 namely 

00:02:15.800 --> 00:02:19.310
 never have to defrost you again 

00:02:17.629 --> 00:02:21.410
 products stay fresh longer 

00:02:19.310 --> 00:02:23.000
 the temperature in your fridge is better 

00:02:21.410 --> 00:02:26.260
 divided and it also works 

00:02:23.000 --> 00:02:26.260
 saving energy 

00:02:27.530 --> 00:02:31.250
 the color of the stainless steel refrigerator but 

00:02:29.540 --> 00:02:34.879
 logical because this is namely stainless steel 

00:02:31.250 --> 00:02:37.069
 material and then side is gray 

00:02:34.879 --> 00:02:38.299
 the operation of this refrigerator is on 

00:02:37.069 --> 00:02:40.340
 outside on the display 

00:02:38.299 --> 00:02:42.530
 if you just did the shopping 

00:02:40.340 --> 00:02:45.829
 then you can use this function nicely 

00:02:42.530 --> 00:02:46.880
 so deliberately frieze then he goes that fast 

00:02:45.829 --> 00:02:48.530
 freezing 

00:02:46.880 --> 00:02:52.160
 you can the freezer you can change the temperature 

00:02:48.530 --> 00:02:55.129
 You can set yourself on so minus 14 to 

00:02:52.160 --> 00:02:57.290
 minus 24 degrees 

00:02:55.129 --> 00:03:01.099
 you can also do the cooling part yourself 

00:02:57.290 --> 00:03:03.049
 set from 7 to 1 degrees 

00:03:01.099 --> 00:03:06.650
 if you press it for three seconds 

00:03:03.049 --> 00:03:09.410
 maintains he saves all that well 

00:03:06.650 --> 00:03:09.769
 does he have a lamp below? 

00:03:09.410 --> 00:03:12.500
 to sit 

00:03:09.769 --> 00:03:14.299
 I got off course again help 

00:03:12.500 --> 00:03:15.680
 should the water filter have to be replaced 

00:03:14.299 --> 00:03:18.230
 then you give that holds to it 

00:03:15.680 --> 00:03:20.090
 these give pressed for 3 seconds 

00:03:18.230 --> 00:03:21.859
 because then reset email but if you have the 

00:03:20.090 --> 00:03:24.859
 you can use ice dispenser 

00:03:21.859 --> 00:03:27.470
 choose between ice cubes between water 

00:03:24.859 --> 00:03:29.450
 or crashed ice I see that light because 

00:03:27.470 --> 00:03:31.760
 The above are the ice cubes yet 

00:03:29.450 --> 00:03:34.040
 pressing once is for it 

00:03:31.760 --> 00:03:34.880
 crashed ice and pressing again is for 

00:03:34.040 --> 00:03:36.950
 the water 

00:03:34.880 --> 00:03:41.109
 now here with your glass against the back 

00:03:36.950 --> 00:03:41.109
 then your chosen product will come out 

00:03:43.140 --> 00:03:47.140
 this fridge uses easy 

00:03:45.550 --> 00:03:48.700
 hamilton first beautiful in the design 

00:03:47.140 --> 00:03:50.530
 eliminated well 

00:03:48.700 --> 00:03:52.660
 pull it open then we see it 

00:03:50.530 --> 00:03:55.209
 does not protrude so you can go further 

00:03:52.660 --> 00:03:58.209
 the wall could be open here 

00:03:55.209 --> 00:03:58.540
 refrigerator compartment has a capacity of 300 62 

00:03:58.209 --> 00:04:00.879
 liters 

00:03:58.540 --> 00:04:01.780
 You can also move those trays and move 

00:04:00.879 --> 00:04:04.420
 also have one 

00:04:01.780 --> 00:04:06.700
 and bottle rack and sit with it 

00:04:04.420 --> 00:04:09.280
 That way you can determine yourself which 

00:04:06.700 --> 00:04:11.290
 height settings that put in it then the 

00:04:09.280 --> 00:04:12.700
 storage in the door he has a two 

00:04:11.290 --> 00:04:14.769
 three four 

00:04:12.700 --> 00:04:16.120
 storage compartments because the upper with one 

00:04:14.769 --> 00:04:18.609
 cover 

00:04:16.120 --> 00:04:20.260
 pretty deep too than the bottom well is too 

00:04:18.609 --> 00:04:22.090
 another egg rack 

00:04:20.260 --> 00:04:23.350
 then of course you can take the bottles 

00:04:22.090 --> 00:04:24.940
 easily lost 

00:04:23.350 --> 00:04:27.850
 she opens the door but was allowed to open the door 

00:04:24.940 --> 00:04:30.790
 You can also be close from the outside 

00:04:27.850 --> 00:04:33.250
 if you also easily then you lose 

00:04:30.790 --> 00:04:35.229
 also less energy because you send one 

00:04:33.250 --> 00:04:37.240
 small box what open money piece just 

00:04:35.229 --> 00:04:40.060
 super cool and this one 

00:04:37.240 --> 00:04:43.030
 home bar is only included with the gsp version 

00:04:40.060 --> 00:04:46.090
 because the gsl version that is completely closed 

00:04:43.030 --> 00:04:47.050
 then at the drawer of the most beautiful balance 

00:04:46.090 --> 00:04:49.479
 crispr 

00:04:47.050 --> 00:04:51.190
 then the humidity degree is ideal 

00:04:49.479 --> 00:04:53.139
 and then you stay vegetables 

00:04:51.190 --> 00:04:55.600
 below are good as long as possible 

00:04:53.139 --> 00:04:58.599
 then the flash such then you are 

00:04:55.600 --> 00:05:01.240
 at about 0 degrees to an ideal 

00:04:58.599 --> 00:05:03.270
 keep your meat in fish fresh as long as possible 

00:05:01.240 --> 00:05:03.270

 and also subdivided it into three boxes 

00:05:19.800 --> 00:05:24.900

 Narrow the road worked in the door you will 

00:05:31.950 --> 00:05:36.390
 do not lose any space here in the freezer 

00:05:34.470 --> 00:05:37.740
 normally sitting here is me
