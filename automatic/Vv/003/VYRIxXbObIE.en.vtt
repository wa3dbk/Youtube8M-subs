can start to charge and on these

00:00:28.950 --> 00:00:31.040 
can start to charge and on these
mandrels<00:00:29.520> there<00:00:29.790> each<00:00:30.090> labeled<00:00:30.600> with<00:00:30.810> their

00:00:31.040 --> 00:00:31.050 
mandrels there each labeled with their

mandrels there each labeled with their
millimeter<00:00:31.500> size<00:00:31.860> that's<00:00:32.250> the<00:00:32.460> diameter<00:00:32.969> of

00:00:32.990 --> 00:00:33.000 
millimeter size that's the diameter of

00:00:33.000 --> 00:00:35.090 
millimeter size that's the diameter of
the<00:00:33.210> mandrel<00:00:33.690> so<00:00:34.260> if<00:00:34.379> you're<00:00:34.530> making<00:00:34.829> jump

00:00:35.090 --> 00:00:35.100 
the mandrel so if you're making jump

00:00:35.100 --> 00:00:37.279 
the mandrel so if you're making jump
rings<00:00:35.280> on<00:00:35.460> these<00:00:35.609> mandrels<00:00:36.089> this<00:00:36.749> size<00:00:36.989> will

00:00:37.279 --> 00:00:37.289 
rings on these mandrels this size will

00:00:37.289 --> 00:00:39.500 
rings on these mandrels this size will
refer<00:00:37.649> to<00:00:37.679> the<00:00:38.100> inner<00:00:38.309> diameter<00:00:38.999> of<00:00:39.030> those

refer to the inner diameter of those
jump<00:00:39.809> rings<00:00:40.850> now<00:00:41.850> use<00:00:42.089> this<00:00:42.300> tool<00:00:42.600> the<00:00:42.749> first

00:00:42.979 --> 00:00:42.989 
jump rings now use this tool the first

jump rings now use this tool the first
thing<00:00:43.170> I'm<00:00:43.320> going<00:00:43.440> to<00:00:43.499> do<00:00:43.710> is<00:00:44.010> insert<00:00:44.699> the

00:00:44.989 --> 00:00:44.999 
thing I'm going to do is insert the

00:00:44.999 --> 00:00:48.349 
thing I'm going to do is insert the
mandrel<00:00:45.539> into<00:00:46.170> the<00:00:46.320> screwdriver<00:00:46.800> tool<00:00:47.359> it

00:00:48.349 --> 00:00:48.359 
mandrel into the screwdriver tool it

00:00:48.359 --> 00:00:52.639 
mandrel into the screwdriver tool it
fits<00:00:48.690> right<00:00:48.899> in<00:00:49.109> there<00:00:49.609> and<00:00:51.170> this<00:00:52.170> little<00:00:52.350> hole

00:00:52.639 --> 00:00:52.649 
fits right in there and this little hole

00:00:52.649 --> 00:00:55.369 
fits right in there and this little hole
here<00:00:52.679> is<00:00:53.399> where<00:00:53.760> you'll<00:00:53.940> put<00:00:54.210> the<00:00:54.510> tip<00:00:54.809> of<00:00:55.050> your

00:00:55.369 --> 00:00:55.379 
here is where you'll put the tip of your

00:00:55.379 --> 00:00:58.759 
here is where you'll put the tip of your
wire<00:00:55.679> I'm<00:00:56.519> working<00:00:56.909> with<00:00:57.149> a<00:00:57.569> copper<00:00:58.050> 22<00:00:58.499> gauge

00:00:58.759 --> 00:00:58.769 
wire I'm working with a copper 22 gauge

00:00:58.769 --> 00:01:01.009 
wire I'm working with a copper 22 gauge
here<00:00:59.069> I'm<00:00:59.219> going<00:00:59.339> to<00:00:59.460> build<00:00:59.640> a<00:00:59.789> coil<00:01:00.089> right<00:01:00.899> on

00:01:01.009 --> 00:01:01.019 
here I'm going to build a coil right on

00:01:01.019 --> 00:01:07.010 
here I'm going to build a coil right on
to<00:01:01.199> this<00:01:01.350> three<00:01:01.649> millimeter<00:01:02.100> mandrel<00:01:04.010> so<00:01:06.020> I'm

00:01:07.010 --> 00:01:07.020 
to this three millimeter mandrel so I'm

00:01:07.020 --> 00:01:08.690 
to this three millimeter mandrel so I'm
going<00:01:07.200> to<00:01:07.229> bend<00:01:07.469> the<00:01:07.590> tip<00:01:07.799> of<00:01:07.829> my<00:01:07.950> wire<00:01:08.310> at<00:01:08.640> a

00:01:08.690 --> 00:01:08.700 
going to bend the tip of my wire at a

00:01:08.700 --> 00:01:13.209 
going to bend the tip of my wire at a
right<00:01:09.270> angle<00:01:10.219> tuck<00:01:11.219> that<00:01:11.430> into<00:01:11.850> this<00:01:12.000> hole<00:01:12.270> and

00:01:13.209 --> 00:01:13.219 
right angle tuck that into this hole and

00:01:13.219 --> 00:01:17.870 
right angle tuck that into this hole and
it<00:01:14.219> anchors<00:01:14.640> the<00:01:14.820> wire<00:01:16.490> now<00:01:17.490> I'm<00:01:17.640> going<00:01:17.789> to

00:01:17.870 --> 00:01:17.880 
it anchors the wire now I'm going to

00:01:17.880 --> 00:01:19.700 
it anchors the wire now I'm going to
support<00:01:18.299> this<00:01:18.420> mandrel<00:01:18.869> with<00:01:19.020> my<00:01:19.170> fingers

00:01:19.700 --> 00:01:19.710 
support this mandrel with my fingers

00:01:19.710 --> 00:01:23.600 
support this mandrel with my fingers
like<00:01:20.189> this<00:01:21.140> letting<00:01:22.140> the<00:01:22.350> wire<00:01:22.560> slowly<00:01:23.219> come

00:01:23.600 --> 00:01:23.610 
like this letting the wire slowly come

00:01:23.610 --> 00:01:29.090 
like this letting the wire slowly come
up<00:01:23.640> and<00:01:24.090> coil<00:01:24.479> on<00:01:24.810> to<00:01:25.320> this<00:01:25.680> mandrel<00:01:26.189> I<00:01:28.039> want<00:01:29.039> to

00:01:29.090 --> 00:01:29.100 
up and coil on to this mandrel I want to

00:01:29.100 --> 00:01:30.260 
up and coil on to this mandrel I want to
point<00:01:29.280> out<00:01:29.399> that<00:01:29.610> the<00:01:29.759> beginning<00:01:30.180> is

00:01:30.260 --> 00:01:30.270 
point out that the beginning is

00:01:30.270 --> 00:01:31.849 
point out that the beginning is
sometimes<00:01:30.689> kind<00:01:31.020> of<00:01:31.109> funky<00:01:31.530> where<00:01:31.710> you're

00:01:31.849 --> 00:01:31.859 
sometimes kind of funky where you're

00:01:31.859 --> 00:01:33.440 
sometimes kind of funky where you're
getting<00:01:32.039> used<00:01:32.310> to<00:01:32.460> it<00:01:32.549> and<00:01:32.700> that's<00:01:32.880> fine<00:01:33.210> we'll

00:01:33.440 --> 00:01:33.450 
getting used to it and that's fine we'll

00:01:33.450 --> 00:01:35.630 
getting used to it and that's fine we'll
just<00:01:33.630> end<00:01:33.750> up<00:01:33.899> trimming<00:01:34.140> that<00:01:34.289> part<00:01:34.710> off<00:01:34.859> but

00:01:35.630 --> 00:01:35.640 
just end up trimming that part off but

00:01:35.640 --> 00:01:37.310 
just end up trimming that part off but
your<00:01:35.759> goal<00:01:35.939> here<00:01:36.299> is<00:01:36.479> to<00:01:36.509> have<00:01:36.840> these<00:01:36.990> coils

00:01:37.310 --> 00:01:37.320 
your goal here is to have these coils

00:01:37.320 --> 00:01:39.770 
your goal here is to have these coils
come<00:01:37.680> up<00:01:37.859> very<00:01:38.219> closely<00:01:38.640> right<00:01:39.210> next<00:01:39.600> to<00:01:39.719> each

00:01:39.770 --> 00:01:39.780 
come up very closely right next to each

00:01:39.780 --> 00:01:42.289 
come up very closely right next to each
other<00:01:39.930> with<00:01:40.259> no<00:01:40.469> gaps<00:01:40.710> if<00:01:41.130> you<00:01:41.700> feed<00:01:41.969> the<00:01:42.119> wire

00:01:42.289 --> 00:01:42.299 
other with no gaps if you feed the wire

00:01:42.299 --> 00:01:44.090 
other with no gaps if you feed the wire
in<00:01:42.539> from<00:01:42.780> an<00:01:42.869> angle<00:01:43.259> you'll<00:01:43.560> have<00:01:43.770> large

00:01:44.090 --> 00:01:44.100 
in from an angle you'll have large

00:01:44.100 --> 00:01:46.249 
in from an angle you'll have large
spaces<00:01:44.460> between<00:01:44.820> your<00:01:45.090> coils<00:01:45.450> and<00:01:45.630> if<00:01:46.140> you

00:01:46.249 --> 00:01:46.259 
spaces between your coils and if you

00:01:46.259 --> 00:01:47.929 
spaces between your coils and if you
feed<00:01:46.469> it<00:01:46.500> in<00:01:46.710> from<00:01:46.920> this<00:01:47.100> angle<00:01:47.310> it<00:01:47.670> will

00:01:47.929 --> 00:01:47.939 
feed it in from this angle it will

00:01:47.939 --> 00:01:50.209 
feed it in from this angle it will
overlap<00:01:48.390> on<00:01:48.630> itself<00:01:49.020> so<00:01:49.619> let<00:01:49.799> it<00:01:49.890> come<00:01:50.070> up

00:01:50.209 --> 00:01:50.219 
overlap on itself so let it come up

00:01:50.219 --> 00:01:58.330 
overlap on itself so let it come up
basically<00:01:50.880> straight<00:01:51.299> in<00:01:51.420> from<00:01:51.600> the<00:01:51.689> bottom

00:01:58.330 --> 00:01:58.340 

00:01:58.340 --> 00:02:00.740 

this<00:01:59.340> does<00:01:59.550> take<00:01:59.760> a<00:01:59.790> little<00:02:00.000> bit<00:02:00.210> of<00:02:00.270> practice

00:02:00.740 --> 00:02:00.750 
this does take a little bit of practice

00:02:00.750 --> 00:02:03.200 
this does take a little bit of practice
so<00:02:00.960> I<00:02:00.990> do<00:02:01.110> recommend<00:02:01.260> practicing<00:02:02.130> and<00:02:02.760> copper

00:02:03.200 --> 00:02:03.210 
so I do recommend practicing and copper

00:02:03.210 --> 00:02:05.900 
so I do recommend practicing and copper
