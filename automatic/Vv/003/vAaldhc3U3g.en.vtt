hole you're going down or whatever so
it's<00:00:17.520> going<00:00:17.970> to<00:00:18.029> be<00:00:18.119> end<00:00:18.630> up<00:00:18.840> turning<00:00:20.150> 20

00:00:21.140 --> 00:00:21.150 
it's going to be end up turning 20

00:00:21.150 --> 00:00:26.230 
it's going to be end up turning 20
degrees<00:00:21.570> that<00:00:21.990> way<00:00:22.220> so<00:00:23.220> yeah<00:00:24.500> I'm<00:00:25.500> using

00:00:26.230 --> 00:00:26.240 
degrees that way so yeah I'm using

00:00:26.240 --> 00:00:30.800 
degrees that way so yeah I'm using
pulsed<00:00:27.240> my<00:00:27.390> back<00:00:27.949> BAM<00:00:29.000> with<00:00:30.000> calibre<00:00:30.660> 50

00:00:30.800 --> 00:00:30.810 
pulsed my back BAM with calibre 50

00:00:30.810 --> 00:00:36.200 
pulsed my back BAM with calibre 50
degree<00:00:31.199> trucks<00:00:31.969> 10<00:00:32.969> inch<00:00:33.500> 10<00:00:34.500> degree<00:00:35.210> wedge

00:00:36.200 --> 00:00:36.210

00:00:36.210 --> 00:00:39.049 
degree trucks 10 inch 10 degree wedge
riser<00:00:36.510> so<00:00:37.050> that<00:00:37.350> reduces<00:00:38.280> the<00:00:38.430> 50<00:00:38.730> degrees

00:00:39.049 --> 00:00:39.059 
riser so that reduces the 50 degrees

00:00:39.059 --> 00:00:51.260 
riser so that reduces the 50 degrees
down<00:00:39.420> to<00:00:44.809> 86<00:00:45.809> a<00:00:48.440> so<00:00:49.440> yeah<00:00:49.829> I'll<00:00:50.190> just<00:00:50.250> get<00:00:50.969> into

way so you don't want to be facing like
that<00:01:34.640> Travis<00:01:35.640> Center<00:01:36.329> down<00:01:36.509> as<00:01:36.659> possible<00:01:37.140> and

00:01:37.780 --> 00:01:37.790 
that Travis Center down as possible and

00:01:37.790 --> 00:01:40.609 
that Travis Center down as possible and
on<00:01:38.790> a<00:01:38.850> better<00:01:39.090> board<00:01:39.390> for<00:01:39.810> like<00:01:40.049> seeds<00:01:40.409> for

00:01:40.609 --> 00:01:40.619 
on a better board for like seeds for

00:01:40.619 --> 00:01:43.280 
on a better board for like seeds for
sliding<00:01:40.979> with<00:01:41.610> better<00:01:41.850> trucks<00:01:42.570> and<00:01:42.840> wheels

00:01:43.280 --> 00:01:43.290 
sliding with better trucks and wheels

00:01:43.290 --> 00:01:45.950 
sliding with better trucks and wheels
and<00:01:43.649> stuff<00:01:43.829> then<00:01:44.579> you're<00:01:45.270> going<00:01:45.479> to<00:01:45.540> only<00:01:45.689> need

00:01:45.950 --> 00:01:45.960 
and stuff then you're going to only need

00:01:45.960 --> 00:01:48.920 
and stuff then you're going to only need
around<00:01:46.409> three<00:01:46.619> pushes<00:01:46.979> with<00:01:47.939> a<00:01:47.970> less<00:01:48.750> high

00:01:48.920 --> 00:01:48.930 
around three pushes with a less high

00:01:48.930 --> 00:01:52.160 
around three pushes with a less high
quality<00:01:49.409> or<00:01:49.920> and<00:01:50.520> truck<00:01:51.090> set<00:01:51.329> up<00:01:51.450> you're<00:01:52.020> going

00:01:52.160 --> 00:01:52.170 
quality or and truck set up you're going

00:01:52.170 --> 00:01:55.370 
quality or and truck set up you're going
to<00:01:52.229> need<00:01:52.640> like<00:01:53.640> probably<00:01:53.880> five<00:01:54.210> good<00:01:55.110> pushes

00:01:55.370 --> 00:01:55.380 
to need like probably five good pushes

00:01:55.380 --> 00:01:58.580 
to need like probably five good pushes
and<00:01:56.479> again<00:01:57.479> it's<00:01:57.659> all<00:01:57.780> about<00:01:57.840> how<00:01:58.170> far<00:01:58.439> your

00:01:58.580 --> 00:01:58.590 
and again it's all about how far your

00:01:58.590 --> 00:01:59.190 
and again it's all about how far your
lean<00:01:58.740> back

00:01:59.190 --> 00:01:59.200 
lean back

00:01:59.200 --> 00:02:03.450 
lean back
back<00:01:59.560> to<00:01:59.710> farm<00:02:00.030> falling<00:02:01.030> back<00:02:01.270> too<00:02:01.899> much<00:02:02.460> have

00:02:03.450 --> 00:02:03.460 
back to farm falling back too much have

00:02:03.460 --> 00:02:05.340 
back to farm falling back too much have
the<00:02:03.610> board<00:02:03.820> slide<00:02:04.060> out<00:02:04.210> away<00:02:04.420> from<00:02:04.450> you<00:02:04.750> you're

00:02:05.340 --> 00:02:05.350 
the board slide out away from you you're

00:02:05.350 --> 00:02:09.570 
the board slide out away from you you're
not<00:02:05.500> leaning<00:02:06.250> far<00:02:06.789> enough<00:02:07.619> like<00:02:08.619> backwards<00:02:08.890> if

00:02:09.570 --> 00:02:09.580 
not leaning far enough like backwards if

00:02:09.580 --> 00:02:12.509 
not leaning far enough like backwards if
you're<00:02:09.759> not<00:02:09.910> doing<00:02:10.119> that<00:02:10.269> enough<00:02:11.200> and<00:02:11.560> the

00:02:12.509 --> 00:02:12.519 
you're not doing that enough and the

00:02:12.519 --> 00:02:14.160 
you're not doing that enough and the
board<00:02:12.819> is<00:02:13.120> just<00:02:13.360> going<00:02:13.510> to<00:02:13.569> stop<00:02:13.840> and<00:02:14.080> you're

00:02:14.160 --> 00:02:14.170 
board is just going to stop and you're

00:02:14.170 --> 00:02:16.199 
board is just going to stop and you're
going<00:02:14.290> to<00:02:14.379> apply<00:02:14.590> for<00:02:14.670> so<00:02:15.670> you<00:02:15.730> really<00:02:16.180> just

00:02:16.199 --> 00:02:16.209 
going to apply for so you really just

00:02:16.209 --> 00:02:17.520 
going to apply for so you really just
you're<00:02:16.540> going<00:02:16.569> to<00:02:16.690> mess<00:02:16.840> up<00:02:17.019> but<00:02:17.200> you<00:02:17.319> have<00:02:17.410> to

00:02:17.520 --> 00:02:17.530 
you're going to mess up but you have to

00:02:17.530 --> 00:02:20.720 
you're going to mess up but you have to
get<00:02:17.680> used<00:02:17.860> to<00:02:17.980> finding<00:02:18.310> that<00:02:18.430> medium<00:02:18.959> so<00:02:19.959> yeah

00:02:20.720 --> 00:02:20.730 
get used to finding that medium so yeah

00:02:20.730 --> 00:02:24.240 
get used to finding that medium so yeah
it's<00:02:21.730> like<00:02:22.120> a<00:02:22.180> speed<00:02:22.540> check<00:02:22.890> but<00:02:23.890> the<00:02:24.069> only

00:02:24.240 --> 00:02:24.250 
it's like a speed check but the only

00:02:24.250 --> 00:02:29.130 
it's like a speed check but the only
difference<00:02:24.489> is<00:02:24.970> it's<00:02:25.870> more<00:02:27.090> and<00:02:28.140> more

00:02:29.130 --> 00:02:29.140 
difference is it's more and more

00:02:29.140 --> 00:02:31.830 
difference is it's more and more
rotation<00:02:30.040> with<00:02:30.190> your<00:02:30.340> shoulders<00:02:30.519> so<00:02:31.510> whereas

00:02:31.830 --> 00:02:31.840 
rotation with your shoulders so whereas

00:02:31.840 --> 00:02:34.080 
rotation with your shoulders so whereas

00:02:34.080 --> 00:02:34.090 
with the speed check you're really going

00:02:34.090 --> 00:02:36.240 
with the speed check you're really going
to<00:02:34.150> want<00:02:34.209> to<00:02:34.390> just<00:02:34.540> keep<00:02:34.900> going<00:02:35.260> straight<00:02:35.290> keep

00:02:36.240 --> 00:02:36.250 
to want to just keep going straight keep

00:02:36.250 --> 00:02:38.490 
to want to just keep going straight keep
your<00:02:36.400> shoulders<00:02:36.640> facing<00:02:37.360> straight<00:02:37.840> and<00:02:38.410> your

00:02:41.039 --> 00:02:41.049 
hips maybe a little bit popped out so

00:02:41.049 --> 00:02:44.670 
hips maybe a little bit popped out so
like<00:02:41.530> that<00:02:41.970> with<00:02:42.970> the<00:02:43.180> 180<00:02:43.599> side<00:02:43.900> you're

00:02:44.670 --> 00:02:44.680 
like that with the 180 side you're

00:02:44.680 --> 00:02:45.809 
like that with the 180 side you're
really<00:02:44.860> going<00:02:45.099> to<00:02:45.160> want<00:02:45.220> to<00:02:45.400> commit<00:02:45.700> your

00:02:49.319 --> 00:02:49.329 
shoulders so go from here to shoulder

00:02:49.329 --> 00:02:52.680 
shoulders so go from here to shoulder
spacing<00:02:49.780> that<00:02:49.930> way<00:02:50.190> like<00:02:51.190> a<00:02:51.430> little<00:02:52.360> more<00:02:52.540> than

00:02:52.680 --> 00:02:52.690 
spacing that way like a little more than

00:02:52.690 --> 00:02:55.160 
spacing that way like a little more than
three-quarters<00:02:52.959> a<00:02:53.410> little<00:02:53.620> way<00:02:53.709> around<00:02:54.700> and

00:02:55.160 --> 00:02:55.170 
three-quarters a little way around and

00:02:55.170 --> 00:02:58.500 
three-quarters a little way around and
you're<00:02:56.170> also<00:02:56.380> going<00:02:56.680> to<00:02:56.819> flex<00:02:57.819> out<00:02:58.060> your<00:02:58.269> hips

00:02:58.500 --> 00:02:58.510 
you're also going to flex out your hips

00:02:58.510 --> 00:03:01.289 
you're also going to flex out your hips
so<00:02:59.200> that<00:02:59.230> they're<00:02:59.739> facing<00:02:59.950> 40<00:03:00.489> beginning<00:03:01.209> of

00:03:01.289 --> 00:03:01.299 
so that they're facing 40 beginning of

00:03:01.299 --> 00:03:05.819 
so that they're facing 40 beginning of
the<00:03:01.360> slide<00:03:01.510> and<00:03:02.940> when<00:03:03.940> you<00:03:04.030> do<00:03:04.180> that<00:03:04.420> your<00:03:04.829> back

00:03:05.819 --> 00:03:05.829 
the slide and when you do that your back

00:03:05.829 --> 00:03:08.099 
the slide and when you do that your back
leg<00:03:06.100> is<00:03:06.359> naturally<00:03:07.359> going<00:03:07.420> to<00:03:07.569> want<00:03:07.750> to<00:03:07.810> sway

00:03:08.099 --> 00:03:08.109 
leg is naturally going to want to sway

00:03:08.109 --> 00:03:11.009 
leg is naturally going to want to sway
around<00:03:08.790> because<00:03:09.790> you're<00:03:10.060> like<00:03:10.239> doesn't<00:03:10.900> go

00:03:11.009 --> 00:03:11.019 
around because you're like doesn't go

00:03:11.019 --> 00:03:23.280 
around because you're like doesn't go
that<00:03:11.200> way<00:03:20.430> let<00:03:21.430> your<00:03:21.609> foot<00:03:21.819> follow<00:03:22.290> its

00:03:23.280 --> 00:03:23.290 
that way let your foot follow its

00:03:23.290 --> 00:03:26.629 
that way let your foot follow its
natural<00:03:23.799> sort<00:03:24.660> and<00:03:25.660> that<00:03:25.870> way<00:03:26.049> you'll<00:03:26.380> get<00:03:26.590> a

00:03:26.629 --> 00:03:26.639 
natural sort and that way you'll get a

00:03:26.639 --> 00:03:30.180 
natural sort and that way you'll get a
pretty<00:03:27.639> smooth<00:03:27.970> slide<00:03:28.239> and<00:03:29.010> usually<00:03:30.010> don't

00:03:30.180 --> 00:03:30.190 
pretty smooth slide and usually don't

00:03:30.190 --> 00:03:32.160 
pretty smooth slide and usually don't
have<00:03:30.340> a<00:03:30.370> problem<00:03:30.700> with<00:03:30.880> overturning<00:03:31.389> because

00:03:32.160 --> 00:03:32.170 
have a problem with overturning because

00:03:32.170 --> 00:03:34.199 
have a problem with overturning because
once<00:03:32.620> you<00:03:32.739> get<00:03:32.859> that<00:03:33.010> full<00:03:33.220> 180<00:03:33.579> you'll

00:03:34.199 --> 00:03:34.209 
once you get that full 180 you'll

00:03:34.209 --> 00:03:40.910 
once you get that full 180 you'll
naturally<00:03:34.480> sort<00:03:35.079> of<00:03:35.139> sink<00:03:35.380> back<00:03:35.590> in<00:03:35.829> so<00:03:37.260> really

00:03:40.910 --> 00:03:40.920 

00:03:40.920 --> 00:03:44.699 

you'll<00:03:41.920> end<00:03:42.730> up<00:03:42.970> messing<00:03:43.180> up<00:03:43.480> so<00:03:43.720> this<00:03:44.380> is<00:03:44.530> what

00:03:44.699 --> 00:03:44.709 
you'll end up messing up so this is what

00:03:44.709 --> 00:03:57.509 
you'll end up messing up so this is what
it<00:03:44.799> looks<00:03:44.980> like<00:03:45.160> so<00:03:45.579> our<00:03:45.639> full<00:03:45.849> speed

00:03:57.509 --> 00:03:57.519 

00:03:57.519 --> 00:04:01.449 

all<00:03:58.519> right<00:03:58.730> um<00:03:59.420> here's<00:04:00.230> some<00:04:00.799> ways<00:04:01.129> that<00:04:01.430> you

00:04:01.449 --> 00:04:01.459 
all right um here's some ways that you

00:04:01.459 --> 00:04:03.759 
all right um here's some ways that you
can<00:04:01.640> mess<00:04:01.819> up<00:04:01.930> say<00:04:02.930> you<00:04:02.989> wing<00:04:03.290> too<00:04:03.439> far<00:04:03.620> back

00:04:03.759 --> 00:04:03.769 
can mess up say you wing too far back

00:04:03.769 --> 00:04:15.069 
can mess up say you wing too far back
you<00:04:03.950> guys<00:04:12.159> really<00:04:13.159> off<00:04:13.370> balance<00:04:13.849> I<00:04:14.060> ended<00:04:14.989> up

00:04:15.069 --> 00:04:15.079 
you guys really off balance I ended up

00:04:15.079 --> 00:04:16.529 
you guys really off balance I ended up
having<00:04:15.290> to<00:04:15.470> step<00:04:15.709> off<00:04:15.890> the<00:04:16.070> board<00:04:16.340> and

having to step off the board and
actually<00:04:17.539> my<00:04:17.660> foot<00:04:17.900> got<00:04:18.049> caught<00:04:18.109> up<00:04:18.410> on<00:04:18.590> my

00:04:18.789 --> 00:04:18.799 
actually my foot got caught up on my

00:04:18.799 --> 00:04:21.939 
actually my foot got caught up on my
wheel<00:04:19.310> some<00:04:19.930> that's<00:04:20.930> one<00:04:21.259> way<00:04:21.440> to<00:04:21.470> myself

00:04:57.570 --> 00:04:57.580 
with it this has been a tutorial on how

00:04:57.580 --> 00:05:01.350 
with it this has been a tutorial on how
to<00:04:57.789> do<00:04:58.030> a<00:04:58.270> 180<00:04:58.900> slide<00:04:59.370> stand<00:05:00.370> up<00:05:00.550> heel<00:05:01.060> side<00:05:01.330> I

00:05:01.350 --> 00:05:01.360 
to do a 180 slide stand up heel side I

00:05:01.360 --> 00:05:06.420 
to do a 180 slide stand up heel side I
think<00:05:01.800> so<00:05:02.800> yeah<00:05:04.020> as<00:05:05.020> soon<00:05:05.080> as<00:05:05.409> I<00:05:05.560> can<00:05:06.039> sort<00:05:06.370> of

00:05:06.420 --> 00:05:06.430 
think so yeah as soon as I can sort of

00:05:06.430 --> 00:05:09.240 
think so yeah as soon as I can sort of
get<00:05:06.550> a<00:05:06.819> little<00:05:07.150> more<00:05:07.389> work<00:05:08.379> done<00:05:08.590> on<00:05:08.650> my<00:05:08.800> toe
