00:00:54.619 --> 00:00:54.629 
your precision and it's also going to

00:00:54.629 --> 00:00:57.049 
your precision and it's also going to
slow<00:00:54.989> down<00:00:55.020> time<00:00:55.649> you'll<00:00:56.370> have<00:00:56.520> to<00:00:56.640> add<00:00:56.789> a<00:00:57.030> few

00:00:57.049 --> 00:00:57.059 
slow down time you'll have to add a few

00:00:57.059 --> 00:00:59.000 
slow down time you'll have to add a few
more<00:00:57.480> points<00:00:57.750> elsewhere<00:00:58.289> to<00:00:58.469> get<00:00:58.649> the<00:00:58.800> other

00:01:03.380 --> 00:01:03.390 
ability points in the crossbow section

00:01:03.390 --> 00:01:06.200

and make sure those abilities are active
as<00:01:06.390> well<00:01:06.840> so<00:01:07.380> as<00:01:07.650> you<00:01:07.770> can<00:01:07.890> see<00:01:08.100> here<00:01:08.490> I'm

00:01:08.660 --> 00:01:08.670 
as well so as you can see here I'm

00:01:08.670 --> 00:01:11.179 
as well so as you can see here I'm
putting<00:01:09.210> them<00:01:09.299> all<00:01:09.510> available<00:01:10.229> so<00:01:10.710> that<00:01:10.890> I<00:01:10.920> can

00:01:11.179 --> 00:01:11.189 
putting them all available so that I can

00:01:11.189 --> 00:01:12.679 
putting them all available so that I can
just<00:01:11.220> use<00:01:11.640> them<00:01:12.240> to<00:01:12.390> their<00:01:12.540> best

00:01:12.679 --> 00:01:12.689 
just use them to their best

00:01:12.689 --> 00:01:13.520 
just use them to their best
effectiveness

00:01:13.520 --> 00:01:13.530 
effectiveness

00:01:13.530 --> 00:01:15.800 
effectiveness
now<00:01:13.909> timers<00:01:14.909> going<00:01:15.030> to<00:01:15.150> slow<00:01:15.330> down<00:01:15.479> and<00:01:15.630> look

00:01:15.800 --> 00:01:15.810 
now timers going to slow down and look

00:01:15.810 --> 00:01:17.420 
now timers going to slow down and look
and<00:01:16.020> as<00:01:16.110> you<00:01:16.140> can<00:01:16.320> see<00:01:16.470> here<00:01:16.770> it's<00:01:17.130> a<00:01:17.250> lot

00:01:17.420 --> 00:01:17.430 
and as you can see here it's a lot

00:01:17.430 --> 00:01:19.550 
and as you can see here it's a lot
easier<00:01:17.880> for<00:01:17.939> me<00:01:18.119> to<00:01:18.390> get<00:01:18.540> headshots<00:01:19.049> that

00:01:19.550 --> 00:01:19.560 
easier for me to get headshots that

00:01:19.560 --> 00:01:22.520 
easier for me to get headshots that
being<00:01:19.860> said<00:01:20.189> you<00:01:20.460> will<00:01:21.000> still<00:01:21.330> miss<00:01:21.689> a<00:01:21.869> lot<00:01:22.229> the

00:01:22.520 --> 00:01:22.530 
being said you will still miss a lot the

00:01:22.530 --> 00:01:24.679 
being said you will still miss a lot the
accuracy<00:01:22.979> in<00:01:23.070> this<00:01:23.159> game<00:01:23.340> is<00:01:23.520> pretty<00:01:23.820> bad<00:01:24.210> so

00:01:24.679 --> 00:01:24.689 
accuracy in this game is pretty bad so

00:01:24.689 --> 00:01:26.090 
accuracy in this game is pretty bad so
as<00:01:24.810> you<00:01:24.930> saw<00:01:25.110> there<00:01:25.350> I've<00:01:25.470> gotten<00:01:25.710> in<00:01:25.830> the<00:01:25.920> head

00:01:26.090 --> 00:01:26.100 
as you saw there I've gotten in the head

00:01:26.100 --> 00:01:27.800 
as you saw there I've gotten in the head
but<00:01:26.520> that<00:01:26.549> did<00:01:26.850> not<00:01:26.880> count<00:01:27.240> just<00:01:27.450> look<00:01:27.659> for

00:01:27.800 --> 00:01:27.810 
but that did not count just look for

00:01:27.810 --> 00:01:30.170 
but that did not count just look for
that<00:01:27.869> critical<00:01:28.200> damage<00:01:28.740> marker<00:01:29.640> to<00:01:29.790> come<00:01:30.000> up

00:01:30.170 --> 00:01:30.180 
that critical damage marker to come up

00:01:30.180 --> 00:01:31.850 
that critical damage marker to come up
and<00:01:30.360> you<00:01:30.750> will<00:01:30.900> know<00:01:31.049> you've<00:01:31.229> got<00:01:31.380> a<00:01:31.409> headshot

00:01:31.850 --> 00:01:31.860 
and you will know you've got a headshot

00:01:31.860 --> 00:01:34.190 
and you will know you've got a headshot
once<00:01:32.490> you<00:01:32.610> peel<00:01:32.759> to<00:01:32.939> those<00:01:33.060> guys<00:01:33.329> go<00:01:33.930> to<00:01:33.990> the

00:01:34.190 --> 00:01:34.200 
once you peel to those guys go to the

00:01:34.200 --> 00:01:35.899 
once you peel to those guys go to the
fast<00:01:34.439> travel<00:01:34.680> point<00:01:34.979> and<00:01:35.159> just<00:01:35.369> leave<00:01:35.640> this

00:01:35.899 --> 00:01:35.909 
fast travel point and just leave this
