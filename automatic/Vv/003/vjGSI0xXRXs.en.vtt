00:00:14.150 --> 00:00:14.160 
longer not very practical in terms of

00:00:14.160 --> 00:00:17.180 
longer not very practical in terms of
you<00:00:14.219> know<00:00:14.340> any<00:00:15.470> you<00:00:16.470> know<00:00:16.560> chopping<00:00:17.039> and

00:00:17.180 --> 00:00:17.190 
you know any you know chopping and

00:00:17.190 --> 00:00:18.529 
you know any you know chopping and
carrying<00:00:17.490> out<00:00:17.550> into<00:00:17.789> the<00:00:17.880> woods<00:00:18.000> but<00:00:18.300> it's

00:00:18.529 --> 00:00:18.539 
carrying out into the woods but it's

00:00:18.539 --> 00:00:19.880 
carrying out into the woods but it's
just<00:00:18.779> kind<00:00:18.960> of<00:00:18.990> a<00:00:19.080> cool<00:00:19.230> collector's<00:00:19.590> items

00:00:19.880 --> 00:00:19.890 
just kind of a cool collector's items

00:00:19.890 --> 00:00:21.500 
just kind of a cool collector's items
but<00:00:20.369> this<00:00:20.520> one<00:00:20.699> I<00:00:20.730> believe<00:00:20.970> is<00:00:21.180> a<00:00:21.210> little<00:00:21.300> bit

00:00:21.500 --> 00:00:21.510 
but this one I believe is a little bit

00:00:21.510 --> 00:00:22.849 
but this one I believe is a little bit
more<00:00:21.630> useful<00:00:21.810> and<00:00:22.170> you<00:00:22.439> know<00:00:22.529> more

00:00:22.849 --> 00:00:22.859 
more useful and you know more

00:00:22.859 --> 00:00:29.080 
more useful and you know more
user-friendly<00:00:25.039> so<00:00:26.039> let's<00:00:26.340> take<00:00:26.580> it<00:00:26.699> out

00:00:29.080 --> 00:00:29.090 

00:00:29.090 --> 00:00:31.279

00:00:31.279 --> 00:00:31.289 
trifa can't even fit in the camp and the

00:00:31.289 --> 00:00:34.310 
trifa can't even fit in the camp and the
camera<00:00:31.650> angle<00:00:32.250> but<00:00:32.690> this<00:00:33.690> is<00:00:33.840> just<00:00:33.960> cool<00:00:34.290> and

00:00:34.310 --> 00:00:34.320 
camera angle but this is just cool and

00:00:34.320 --> 00:00:35.810 
camera angle but this is just cool and
you<00:00:34.559> can<00:00:34.590> see<00:00:34.800> I<00:00:34.829> use<00:00:35.010> them<00:00:35.190> a<00:00:35.250> lot<00:00:35.489> I've

00:00:51.410 --> 00:00:51.420 
work knife it's made by bussy combat see

00:00:51.420 --> 00:00:54.170 
work knife it's made by bussy combat see
the<00:00:51.539> logo<00:00:51.870> logo<00:00:52.260> is<00:00:52.500> their<00:00:52.680> fusion<00:00:53.520> or<00:00:53.940> their

00:00:54.170 --> 00:00:54.180 
the logo logo is their fusion or their

00:00:54.180 --> 00:00:56.240 
the logo logo is their fusion or their
you<00:00:54.960> know<00:00:55.020> one<00:00:55.320> of<00:00:55.410> the<00:00:55.469> variations<00:00:55.680> of<00:00:55.980> fusion

00:00:56.240 --> 00:00:56.250 
you know one of the variations of fusion

00:00:56.250 --> 00:00:59.000 
you know one of the variations of fusion
steelheart's<00:00:57.079> and<00:00:58.079> this<00:00:58.289> is<00:00:58.410> I<00:00:58.469> guess<00:00:58.620> this<00:00:58.890> is

00:00:59.000 --> 00:00:59.010 
steelheart's and this is I guess this is

00:00:59.010 --> 00:01:01.760 
steelheart's and this is I guess this is
the<00:00:59.160> larger<00:00:59.969> version<00:01:00.000> of<00:01:00.390> Steel<00:01:00.690> hard<00:01:00.870> the

technology<00:01:20.159> personally<00:01:21.090> I<00:01:21.119> like<00:01:21.240> this<00:01:21.330> one

00:01:21.440 --> 00:01:21.450 
technology personally I like this one

00:01:21.450 --> 00:01:24.050 
technology personally I like this one
cause<00:01:21.509> it's<00:01:21.720> just<00:01:21.810> yeah<00:01:22.259> steak<00:01:23.040> it's<00:01:23.280> 0.32

00:01:24.050 --> 00:01:24.060 
cause it's just yeah steak it's 0.32

00:01:24.060 --> 00:01:27.700 
cause it's just yeah steak it's 0.32
just<00:01:24.299> stick<00:01:24.570> compare<00:01:25.020> this<00:01:25.170> to<00:01:25.409> a<00:01:25.580> let's<00:01:26.580> say<00:01:26.820> a

00:01:27.700 --> 00:01:27.710 
just stick compare this to a let's say a

00:01:27.710 --> 00:01:34.069 
just stick compare this to a let's say a
sub<00:01:28.710> calm<00:01:31.729> yeah<00:01:32.729> it's<00:01:32.939> it's<00:01:33.150> laughably<00:01:33.720> thick

00:01:34.069 --> 00:01:34.079 
sub calm yeah it's it's laughably thick

00:01:34.079 --> 00:01:37.819 
sub calm yeah it's it's laughably thick
but<00:01:34.290> it's<00:01:34.409> just<00:01:34.560> so<00:01:34.829> cool<00:01:35.100> and<00:01:35.909> it's<00:01:36.829> it's

00:01:37.819 --> 00:01:37.829 
but it's just so cool and it's it's

00:01:37.829 --> 00:01:40.190 
but it's just so cool and it's it's
basically<00:01:38.340> your<00:01:39.000> all-purpose<00:01:39.390> destroy

00:01:40.190 --> 00:01:40.200 
basically your all-purpose destroy
