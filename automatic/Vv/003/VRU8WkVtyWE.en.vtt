today<00:00:04.000> we're<00:00:04.210> installing<00:00:04.450> an<00:00:05.140> agency<00:00:06.040> raider

00:00:07.019 --> 00:00:07.029 
today we're installing an agency raider

00:00:07.029 --> 00:00:09.119 
today we're installing an agency raider
sway<00:00:07.330> bar<00:00:07.540> it's<00:00:07.870> a<00:00:08.020> 22<00:00:08.290> millimeter<00:00:08.799> it's

00:00:09.119 --> 00:00:09.129 
sway bar it's a 22 millimeter it's

00:00:09.129 --> 00:00:12.750 
sway bar it's a 22 millimeter it's
adjustable<00:00:10.650> with<00:00:11.650> these<00:00:11.830> reinforcements

00:00:12.750 --> 00:00:12.760 
adjustable with these reinforcements

00:00:12.760 --> 00:00:17.550 
adjustable with these reinforcements
brackets<00:00:14.430> the<00:00:15.430> middle<00:00:15.699> is<00:00:15.940> 22<00:00:16.600> I<00:00:16.990> guess<00:00:17.380> it

00:00:17.550 --> 00:00:17.560 
brackets the middle is 22 I guess it

00:00:17.560 --> 00:00:22.169 
brackets the middle is 22 I guess it
goes<00:00:17.650> to<00:00:17.800> 20<00:00:18.160> and<00:00:18.250> then<00:00:18.339> 24<00:00:20.730> what<00:00:21.730> will<00:00:21.910> need

00:00:22.169 --> 00:00:22.179 
goes to 20 and then 24 what will need

00:00:22.179 --> 00:00:30.230 
goes to 20 and then 24 what will need
for<00:00:22.570> this<00:00:23.580> project<00:00:24.779> is<00:00:25.779> jack<00:00:26.679> stands<00:00:27.449> Jack<00:00:28.449> and

00:00:30.230 --> 00:00:30.240 
for this project is jack stands Jack and

00:00:30.240 --> 00:00:33.810 
for this project is jack stands Jack and
probably<00:00:31.240> at<00:00:31.419> 12<00:00:31.869> and<00:00:32.259> 14<00:00:32.740> millimeter<00:00:33.100> but

00:00:33.810 --> 00:00:33.820 
probably at 12 and 14 millimeter but

00:00:33.820 --> 00:00:35.729 
probably at 12 and 14 millimeter but
we'll<00:00:34.239> i'll<00:00:34.989> let<00:00:35.140> you<00:00:35.230> know<00:00:35.350> if<00:00:35.500> we<00:00:35.530> need

00:00:35.729 --> 00:00:35.739 
we'll i'll let you know if we need

00:00:35.739 --> 00:00:38.400 
we'll i'll let you know if we need
anything<00:00:36.039> different<00:00:36.670> than<00:00:36.730> that<00:00:37.140> okay<00:00:38.140> so<00:00:38.199> the

00:00:38.400 --> 00:00:38.410 
anything different than that okay so the

00:00:38.410 --> 00:00:39.959 
anything different than that okay so the
first<00:00:38.440> step<00:00:38.710> is<00:00:38.920> to<00:00:38.980> jack<00:00:39.280> up<00:00:39.430> the<00:00:39.579> vehicle

00:00:39.959 --> 00:00:39.969 
first step is to jack up the vehicle

00:00:39.969 --> 00:00:48.760 
first step is to jack up the vehicle
let's<00:00:40.420> go<00:00:40.600> Andy

00:04:31.320 --> 00:04:31.330 
bolt right here or this side of the boat

00:04:31.330 --> 00:04:33.659

00:04:33.659 --> 00:04:33.669 
was on the other side now we've switched

00:04:33.669 --> 00:04:37.339 
was on the other side now we've switched
it<00:04:33.970> to<00:04:34.830> from<00:04:35.830> to<00:04:36.099> be<00:04:36.220> bolted<00:04:36.580> from<00:04:36.639> the<00:04:36.729> inside

it to from to be bolted from the inside

00:04:37.349 --> 00:04:42.210 
it to from to be bolted from the inside

00:04:42.210 --> 00:04:42.220 
so this is what it should look like and

00:04:42.220 --> 00:04:46.710
