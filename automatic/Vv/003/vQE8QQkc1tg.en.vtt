they're making good candy sugar crystals

00:00:10.990 --> 00:00:17.540 
they're making good candy sugar crystals
Krystal's<00:00:13.440> and<00:00:14.440> what<00:00:14.620> did<00:00:14.740> we<00:00:14.769> put<00:00:15.010> in<00:00:15.160> the<00:00:15.219> pot

00:00:26.339 --> 00:00:26.349 
doing a small batch one and a half cups

00:00:26.349 --> 00:00:29.870 
doing a small batch one and a half cups
of<00:00:26.560> sugar<00:00:26.829> and<00:00:27.300> a<00:00:28.300> half<00:00:28.330> cup<00:00:28.539> of<00:00:28.990> water<00:00:29.050> and

00:00:29.870 --> 00:00:29.880 
of sugar and a half cup of water and

00:00:29.880 --> 00:00:32.189 
of sugar and a half cup of water and
then<00:00:30.880> I<00:00:30.910> put<00:00:31.240> in<00:00:31.359> a<00:00:31.420> little<00:00:31.539> bit<00:00:31.750> of<00:00:31.779> peppermint

00:00:32.189 --> 00:00:32.199 
then I put in a little bit of peppermint

00:00:32.199 --> 00:00:37.290 
then I put in a little bit of peppermint
flavoring<00:00:32.980> to<00:00:33.300> make<00:00:34.300> it<00:00:34.449> taste<00:00:35.110> like<00:00:35.199> and<00:00:36.300> then

00:00:37.290 --> 00:00:37.300 
flavoring to make it taste like and then

00:00:37.300 --> 00:00:40.950 
flavoring to make it taste like and then
we<00:00:37.390> put<00:00:37.629> it<00:00:37.720> on<00:00:38.640> medium<00:00:39.640> heat<00:00:39.910> for<00:00:40.210> about<00:00:40.390> two

00:00:40.950 --> 00:00:40.960 
we put it on medium heat for about two

00:00:40.960 --> 00:00:44.520 
we put it on medium heat for about two
minutes<00:00:41.230> until<00:00:42.150> all<00:00:43.150> of<00:00:43.180> the<00:00:43.510> sugar<00:00:43.540> dissolved

00:00:44.520 --> 00:00:44.530 
minutes until all of the sugar dissolved

00:00:44.530 --> 00:00:48.210 
minutes until all of the sugar dissolved
really<00:00:44.890> really<00:00:45.159> well<00:00:45.780> now<00:00:46.780> we're<00:00:47.739> gonna<00:00:47.890> pour

00:00:48.210 --> 00:00:48.220 
really really well now we're gonna pour

00:00:48.220 --> 00:00:54.090 
really really well now we're gonna pour
it<00:00:48.370> into<00:00:48.549> a<00:00:49.799> glass<00:00:50.799> jar<00:00:52.350> and<00:00:53.350> we're<00:00:54.010> gonna

00:00:54.090 --> 00:00:54.100 
it into a glass jar and we're gonna

00:00:54.100 --> 00:00:56.160 
it into a glass jar and we're gonna
suspend<00:00:54.640> some<00:00:54.940> popsicle<00:00:55.540> sticks<00:00:55.809> in<00:00:55.989> there

00:00:56.160 --> 00:00:56.170 
suspend some popsicle sticks in there

00:00:56.170 --> 00:01:00.660 
suspend some popsicle sticks in there
and<00:00:56.320> see<00:00:56.500> what<00:00:56.650> we<00:00:56.769> get<00:00:57.010> huh<00:00:57.690> okay<00:00:59.549> so<00:01:00.549> we

00:01:00.660 --> 00:01:00.670 
and see what we get huh okay so we

00:01:00.670 --> 00:01:04.829 
and see what we get huh okay so we
dissolved<00:01:01.390> the<00:01:01.659> sugar<00:01:03.330> and<00:01:04.330> we<00:01:04.479> put<00:01:04.659> in<00:01:04.780> some

00:01:04.829 --> 00:01:04.839 
dissolved the sugar and we put in some

00:01:04.839 --> 00:01:07.950 
dissolved the sugar and we put in some
what<00:01:05.260> color<00:01:05.500> food<00:01:05.799> coloring<00:01:06.540> what<00:01:07.540> color<00:01:07.750> is

00:01:07.950 --> 00:01:07.960 
what color food coloring what color is

00:01:07.960 --> 00:01:10.649 
what color food coloring what color is
red<00:01:08.409> and<00:01:08.710> then<00:01:08.860> some<00:01:09.040> peppermint<00:01:09.450> and<00:01:10.450> then<00:01:10.540> we

00:01:10.649 --> 00:01:10.659 
red and then some peppermint and then we

00:01:10.659 --> 00:01:15.120 
red and then some peppermint and then we
poured<00:01:10.990> it<00:01:11.080> into<00:01:11.260> this<00:01:11.439> jar<00:01:13.500> jar<00:01:14.500> and<00:01:14.950> then

00:01:15.120 --> 00:01:15.130 
poured it into this jar jar and then

00:01:15.130 --> 00:01:19.310 
poured it into this jar jar and then
what<00:01:15.310> did<00:01:15.399> we<00:01:15.429> put<00:01:15.700> in<00:01:15.789> the<00:01:15.880> jar<00:01:17.880> some<00:01:18.880> sticks

00:01:19.310 --> 00:01:19.320 
what did we put in the jar some sticks

00:01:19.320 --> 00:01:28.489 
what did we put in the jar some sticks
and<00:01:20.320> what's<00:01:20.859> gonna<00:01:21.039> happen<00:01:21.179> yeah<00:01:26.700> red<00:01:27.700> crisp

00:01:28.489 --> 00:01:28.499 
and what's gonna happen yeah red crisp

00:01:28.499 --> 00:01:32.840 
and what's gonna happen yeah red crisp
red<00:01:29.499> crystals<00:01:30.249> red<00:01:30.490> sugar<00:01:30.789> crystals<00:01:31.390> yeah

00:01:32.840 --> 00:01:32.850 
red crystals red sugar crystals yeah

00:01:32.850 --> 00:01:37.739 
red crystals red sugar crystals yeah
then<00:01:33.850> we<00:01:33.969> can<00:01:33.999> eat<00:01:34.509> them<00:01:35.999> yeah<00:01:36.999> it's<00:01:37.390> gonna<00:01:37.539> be

00:01:37.739 --> 00:01:37.749 
then we can eat them yeah it's gonna be

00:01:37.749 --> 00:01:43.859 
then we can eat them yeah it's gonna be
yummy<00:01:38.640> yeah<00:01:39.659> I<00:01:41.399> know<00:01:42.399> that's<00:01:42.850> cool<00:01:43.390> it's<00:01:43.719> gonna

00:01:54.370 --> 00:01:54.380 

00:01:54.380 --> 00:01:59.460 

they're<00:01:55.100> very<00:01:55.939> careful<00:01:57.430> can<00:01:58.430> you<00:01:58.490> get<00:01:58.700> it

00:01:59.460 --> 00:01:59.470 
they're very careful can you get it

00:01:59.470 --> 00:02:01.510 
they're very careful can you get it
careful<00:02:00.470> careful<00:02:00.650> you<00:02:00.979> don't<00:02:01.130> want<00:02:01.280> them<00:02:01.369> to

00:02:01.510 --> 00:02:01.520 
careful careful you don't want them to

00:02:01.520 --> 00:02:09.550 
careful careful you don't want them to
break<00:02:01.700> off<00:02:01.909> oh<00:02:07.060> the<00:02:08.060> drip<00:02:08.330> on<00:02:08.509> you<00:02:08.539> it's<00:02:09.259> okay

00:02:09.550 --> 00:02:09.560 
break off oh the drip on you it's okay

00:02:09.560 --> 00:02:11.850 
break off oh the drip on you it's okay
I'll<00:02:09.950> get<00:02:10.130> a<00:02:10.190> little<00:02:10.429> drip

00:02:11.850 --> 00:02:11.860 
I'll get a little drip

00:02:11.860 --> 00:02:15.809 
I'll get a little drip
those<00:02:12.860> are<00:02:13.069> sugar<00:02:13.370> crystals<00:02:13.940> huh

00:02:15.809 --> 00:02:15.819 
those are sugar crystals huh

00:02:15.819 --> 00:02:23.050 
those are sugar crystals huh
you<00:02:16.819> want<00:02:16.970> to<00:02:17.030> try<00:02:17.180> licking<00:02:17.390> it<00:02:21.819> it<00:02:22.819> tastes

00:02:23.050 --> 00:02:23.060 
you want to try licking it it tastes

00:02:23.060 --> 00:02:45.699 
you want to try licking it it tastes
yummy<00:02:30.550> tastes<00:02:31.550> like<00:02:31.700> sugar<00:02:44.590> what<00:02:45.590> do<00:02:45.650> you

00:02:45.699 --> 00:02:45.709 
yummy tastes like sugar what do you

00:02:45.709 --> 00:02:48.009 
yummy tastes like sugar what do you
think<00:02:45.950> for<00:02:46.459> the<00:02:46.580> fun<00:02:46.790> experiment<00:02:47.510> did<00:02:47.780> we<00:02:47.870> make

00:02:48.009 --> 00:02:48.019 
think for the fun experiment did we make

00:02:48.019 --> 00:02:51.190 
think for the fun experiment did we make
sugar<00:02:48.350> crystals<00:02:49.030> yeah<00:02:50.030> yeah<00:02:50.810> they're<00:02:51.019> pretty

00:02:51.190 --> 00:02:51.200 
sugar crystals yeah yeah they're pretty

00:02:51.200 --> 00:02:57.009 
sugar crystals yeah yeah they're pretty
cool<00:02:52.299> I'm<00:02:53.299> thinking<00:02:53.750> a<00:02:53.840> bigger<00:02:54.110> jar<00:02:54.790> and<00:02:56.019> just

00:02:57.009 --> 00:02:57.019 
cool I'm thinking a bigger jar and just

00:02:57.019 --> 00:02:59.050 
cool I'm thinking a bigger jar and just
one<00:02:57.350> big<00:02:57.890> stick<00:02:58.250> in<00:02:58.430> the<00:02:58.519> middle<00:02:58.850> would

00:02:59.050 --> 00:02:59.060 
one big stick in the middle would

00:02:59.060 --> 00:03:02.710 
one big stick in the middle would
probably<00:02:59.540> work<00:02:59.750> best<00:03:01.150> because<00:03:02.150> the<00:03:02.390> others

00:03:02.710 --> 00:03:02.720 
probably work best because the others

00:03:02.720 --> 00:03:04.539 
probably work best because the others
are<00:03:02.750> all<00:03:03.079> stuck<00:03:03.590> to<00:03:03.739> the<00:03:03.829> side<00:03:04.100> in<00:03:04.280> the<00:03:04.370> bottom

00:03:04.539 --> 00:03:04.549 
are all stuck to the side in the bottom

00:03:04.549 --> 00:03:09.819 
are all stuck to the side in the bottom
yeah<00:03:07.299> okay<00:03:08.299> but<00:03:08.600> we<00:03:08.720> learned<00:03:08.959> huh

00:03:09.819 --> 00:03:09.829 
yeah okay but we learned huh

00:03:09.829 --> 00:03:13.449 
yeah okay but we learned huh
yeah<00:03:10.720> and<00:03:11.720> how<00:03:12.320> does<00:03:12.380> that<00:03:12.500> work<00:03:12.859> why<00:03:13.190> did<00:03:13.370> the

00:03:13.449 --> 00:03:13.459 
yeah and how does that work why did the

00:03:13.459 --> 00:03:19.060 
yeah and how does that work why did the
sugar<00:03:13.670> crystals<00:03:13.910> form<00:03:14.420> on<00:03:14.600> there<00:03:15.760> you<00:03:16.760> know<00:03:18.070> so

00:03:19.060 --> 00:03:19.070 
sugar crystals form on there you know so

00:03:19.070 --> 00:03:22.180 
sugar crystals form on there you know so
the<00:03:19.160> water<00:03:19.630> evaporated<00:03:20.630> dry<00:03:20.930> and<00:03:21.290> then

00:03:22.180 --> 00:03:22.190 
the water evaporated dry and then

00:03:22.190 --> 00:03:24.160 
the water evaporated dry and then
because<00:03:23.090> there<00:03:23.239> was<00:03:23.359> less<00:03:23.600> water<00:03:23.900> the

00:03:24.160 --> 00:03:24.170 
because there was less water the

00:03:24.170 --> 00:03:26.410 
because there was less water the
crystals<00:03:24.620> had<00:03:24.829> to<00:03:24.980> form<00:03:25.250> together<00:03:25.640> so<00:03:26.299> that

00:03:26.410 --> 00:03:26.420 
crystals had to form together so that

00:03:26.420 --> 00:03:28.060 
crystals had to form together so that
came<00:03:26.660> out<00:03:26.780> of<00:03:26.810> the<00:03:26.989> water<00:03:27.200> and<00:03:27.440> formed<00:03:27.769> on<00:03:27.890> that
