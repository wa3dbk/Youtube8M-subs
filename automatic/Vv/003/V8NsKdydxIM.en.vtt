the beautiful analog button right there

00:00:25.470 --> 00:00:27.769 
the beautiful analog button right there
in<00:00:25.619> the<00:00:25.710> center<00:00:25.890> and<00:00:26.400> it's<00:00:26.760> very<00:00:27.119> Sony<00:00:27.570> like

00:00:27.769 --> 00:00:27.779

the PlayStation 3 mode of course you get
that<00:00:32.369> same<00:00:32.880> convex<00:00:33.600> controller<00:00:34.590> and

00:00:34.970 --> 00:00:34.980 
that same convex controller and

00:00:34.980 --> 00:00:36.680 
that same convex controller and
everything's<00:00:35.850> about<00:00:36.000> the<00:00:36.120> same<00:00:36.300> so<00:00:36.480> let's

00:00:40.069 --> 00:00:40.079 
focus it here focus so that we don't get

00:00:40.079 --> 00:00:42.229 
focus it here focus so that we don't get
any<00:00:40.230> more<00:00:40.379> interruptions<00:00:41.219> and<00:00:41.700> there<00:00:41.969> you<00:00:42.090> go

00:00:42.229 --> 00:00:42.239 
any more interruptions and there you go

guys it looks exactly the same now was
there<00:00:45.300> a<00:00:45.329> fan<00:00:45.629> of<00:00:45.750> these<00:00:46.010> controllers<00:00:47.010> I<00:00:47.309> mean

00:00:47.450 --> 00:00:47.460 
there a fan of these controllers I mean

00:00:47.460 --> 00:00:49.250 
there a fan of these controllers I mean
ever<00:00:47.760> since<00:00:47.850> the<00:00:48.030> PlayStation<00:00:48.420> threw<00:00:48.570> us<00:00:48.750> to

00:00:49.250 --> 00:00:49.260 
ever since the PlayStation threw us to

00:00:49.260 --> 00:00:50.330 
ever since the PlayStation threw us to
us<00:00:49.379> the<00:00:49.500> only<00:00:49.530> controller<00:00:49.920> that<00:00:50.010> she<00:00:50.160> pretty

00:00:50.330 --> 00:00:50.340 
us the only controller that she pretty

00:00:50.340 --> 00:00:52.490 
us the only controller that she pretty
much<00:00:50.489> liked<00:00:50.700> everything<00:00:50.940> was<00:00:51.149> huge<00:00:51.449> so<00:00:51.780> you

00:00:52.490 --> 00:00:52.500 
much liked everything was huge so you

00:00:52.500 --> 00:00:55.250 
much liked everything was huge so you
liked<00:00:52.920> that<00:00:52.949> controller<00:00:53.489> but<00:00:54.059> Xbox<00:00:54.570> 360<00:00:55.050> came

00:00:55.250 --> 00:00:55.260 
liked that controller but Xbox 360 came

00:00:55.260 --> 00:00:59.119 
liked that controller but Xbox 360 came
and<00:00:55.440> changed<00:00:55.890> history<00:00:56.239> with<00:00:57.239> this<00:00:58.199> design<00:00:58.949> of

00:00:59.119 --> 00:00:59.129 
and changed history with this design of

00:00:59.129 --> 00:01:01.459 
and changed history with this design of
course<00:00:59.309> this<00:00:59.550> isn't<00:00:59.789> the<00:01:00.449> Xbox<00:01:00.809> 360<00:01:01.230> design

00:01:01.459 --> 00:01:01.469 
course this isn't the Xbox 360 design

00:01:01.469 --> 00:01:03.740 
course this isn't the Xbox 360 design
but<00:01:01.649> it<00:01:01.739> is<00:01:01.859> the<00:01:02.219> power<00:01:02.460> a<00:01:02.789> controller<00:01:03.329> cuz<00:01:03.629> it

00:01:03.740 --> 00:01:03.750 
but it is the power a controller cuz it

00:01:03.750 --> 00:01:06.050 
but it is the power a controller cuz it
looks<00:01:03.780> exactly<00:01:04.080> like<00:01:04.409> an<00:01:04.860> Xbox<00:01:05.610> 360

00:01:06.050 --> 00:01:06.060 
looks exactly like an Xbox 360

00:01:06.060 --> 00:01:07.460 
looks exactly like an Xbox 360
controller<00:01:06.450> let's<00:01:07.020> talk<00:01:07.170> about<00:01:07.260> features

00:01:07.460 --> 00:01:07.470 
controller let's talk about features

00:01:07.470 --> 00:01:09.140 
controller let's talk about features
let's<00:01:07.860> move<00:01:08.010> these<00:01:08.159> controllers<00:01:08.580> out<00:01:08.939> of<00:01:09.090> the

00:01:09.140 --> 00:01:09.150 
let's move these controllers out of the

00:01:09.150 --> 00:01:11.200 
let's move these controllers out of the
way<00:01:09.240> so<00:01:09.299> doesn't<00:01:09.659> interrupt<00:01:10.439> you<00:01:10.680> in<00:01:10.830> any<00:01:10.979> way

00:01:11.200 --> 00:01:11.210 
way so doesn't interrupt you in any way

00:01:11.210 --> 00:01:13.640 
way so doesn't interrupt you in any way
let's<00:01:12.210> talk<00:01:12.299> about<00:01:12.390> features<00:01:12.810> before<00:01:13.320> we<00:01:13.560> get

00:01:13.640 --> 00:01:13.650 
let's talk about features before we get

00:01:13.650 --> 00:01:16.670 
let's talk about features before we get
to<00:01:13.770> the<00:01:13.860> cons<00:01:14.040> of<00:01:14.310> this<00:01:14.700> controller<00:01:15.350> so<00:01:16.350> we<00:01:16.380> get

00:01:16.670 --> 00:01:16.680 
to the cons of this controller so we get

00:01:16.680 --> 00:01:19.249 
to the cons of this controller so we get
a<00:01:16.710> nice<00:01:16.950> grip<00:01:17.490> type<00:01:17.970> fill<00:01:18.420> here<00:01:18.750> it<00:01:18.900> makes<00:01:19.110> you

00:01:19.249 --> 00:01:19.259 
a nice grip type fill here it makes you

00:01:19.259 --> 00:01:22.340 
a nice grip type fill here it makes you
look<00:01:19.470> nice<00:01:20.070> and<00:01:20.520> it<00:01:20.729> also<00:01:20.880> allows<00:01:21.810> you<00:01:22.020> to<00:01:22.110> hold

00:01:22.340 --> 00:01:22.350 
look nice and it also allows you to hold

00:01:22.350 --> 00:01:24.109 
look nice and it also allows you to hold
the<00:01:22.470> controller<00:01:22.740> much<00:01:23.009> much<00:01:23.549> better<00:01:23.790> of

00:01:24.109 --> 00:01:24.119 
the controller much much better of

00:01:24.119 --> 00:01:25.429 
the controller much much better of
course<00:01:24.420> if<00:01:24.750> you<00:01:24.840> had<00:01:24.960> those<00:01:25.110> annoying

course if you had those annoying

00:01:25.439 --> 00:01:26.990 
course if you had those annoying
PlayStation<00:01:26.070> 3<00:01:26.310> controllers<00:01:26.729> the<00:01:26.820> first

00:01:26.990 --> 00:01:27.000 
PlayStation 3 controllers the first

00:01:27.000 --> 00:01:28.490 
PlayStation 3 controllers the first
generation<00:01:27.509> PlayStation<00:01:27.960> 2<00:01:28.049> controllers

00:01:28.490 --> 00:01:28.500 
generation PlayStation 2 controllers

00:01:28.500 --> 00:01:31.039 
generation PlayStation 2 controllers
they<00:01:29.009> were<00:01:29.070> very<00:01:29.430> glossy<00:01:30.210> and<00:01:30.509> you<00:01:30.780> can<00:01:30.930> see

00:01:31.039 --> 00:01:31.049 
they were very glossy and you can see

00:01:31.049 --> 00:01:32.120 
they were very glossy and you can see
the<00:01:31.170> fingerprints<00:01:31.650> and<00:01:31.770> whatnot<00:01:32.100> and

00:01:32.120 --> 00:01:32.130 
the fingerprints and whatnot and

00:01:32.130 --> 00:01:34.640 
the fingerprints and whatnot and
slickery<00:01:32.700> of<00:01:33.479> course<00:01:33.780> the<00:01:33.990> second<00:01:34.320> generation

00:01:34.640 --> 00:01:34.650 
slickery of course the second generation

00:01:34.650 --> 00:01:37.039 
slickery of course the second generation
ones<00:01:35.009> are<00:01:35.430> much<00:01:35.759> better<00:01:36.060> with<00:01:36.420> a<00:01:36.450> matte<00:01:36.689> finish

00:01:37.039 --> 00:01:37.049 
ones are much better with a matte finish

00:01:37.049 --> 00:01:39.050 
ones are much better with a matte finish
and<00:01:37.229> this<00:01:37.740> as<00:01:37.979> well<00:01:38.130> has<00:01:38.369> a<00:01:38.400> matte<00:01:38.579> finish<00:01:38.880> but

00:01:39.050 --> 00:01:39.060 
and this as well has a matte finish but

00:01:39.060 --> 00:01:41.660 
and this as well has a matte finish but
not<00:01:39.450> only<00:01:39.540> that<00:01:39.659> it<00:01:39.990> has<00:01:40.110> these<00:01:40.320> nice<00:01:40.670> textured

00:01:41.660 --> 00:01:41.670 
not only that it has these nice textured

00:01:41.670 --> 00:01:43.910 
not only that it has these nice textured
things<00:01:41.880> like<00:01:42.090> I<00:01:42.180> said<00:01:42.360> and<00:01:42.600> it<00:01:42.810> makes<00:01:42.990> you<00:01:43.200> hold

00:01:43.910 --> 00:01:43.920 
things like I said and it makes you hold

00:01:43.920 --> 00:01:48.100 
things like I said and it makes you hold
