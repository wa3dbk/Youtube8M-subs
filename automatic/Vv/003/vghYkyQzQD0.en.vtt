the back of laboratory is a massive cold
room<00:01:41.740> store<00:01:42.250> so<00:01:42.850> samples<00:01:43.479> will<00:01:43.630> come<00:01:43.960> in<00:01:44.170> then

00:01:44.790 --> 00:01:44.800 
room store so samples will come in then

00:01:44.800 --> 00:01:46.760 
room store so samples will come in then
they'll<00:01:45.130> have<00:01:45.280> been<00:01:45.460> sorted<00:01:45.940> and<00:01:46.060> bar-coded

00:01:53.730 --> 00:01:53.740 
so the basic blood samples will go on to

00:01:53.740 --> 00:01:56.090 
so the basic blood samples will go on to
the<00:01:53.860> system<00:01:54.310> and<00:01:54.490> by<00:01:55.299> the<00:01:55.360> end<00:01:55.570> of<00:01:55.690> the<00:01:55.810> day

00:02:42.300 --> 00:02:45.890 
efficiently so what you see there is
almost<00:02:42.570> like<00:02:42.780> a<00:02:42.840> train<00:02:43.170> track<00:02:43.580> and<00:02:44.580> where<00:02:44.900> as

almost like a train track and where as

00:02:45.900 --> 00:02:47.600 
almost like a train track and where as
you<00:02:45.960> spoke<00:02:46.260> earlier<00:02:46.500> regarding<00:02:46.800> the<00:02:47.160> barcodes

00:02:47.600 --> 00:02:47.610 
you spoke earlier regarding the barcodes

00:02:47.610 --> 00:02:49.490 
you spoke earlier regarding the barcodes
and<00:02:47.940> the<00:02:48.180> samples<00:02:48.660> with<00:02:48.990> their<00:02:49.110> correctly

00:02:49.500 --> 00:02:52.480 
and the samples with their correctly
labeled<00:02:49.560> each

00:02:52.480 --> 00:02:52.490 

00:02:52.490 --> 00:02:55.840

00:03:00.070 --> 00:03:00.080 
by looking at the digit specific digits

00:03:00.080 --> 00:03:02.440 
by looking at the digit specific digits
and<00:03:00.320> they<00:03:00.620> will<00:03:00.770> know<00:03:00.980> what<00:03:01.280> machine<00:03:01.670> what<00:03:02.330> you

that<00:03:51.189> called<00:03:51.370> again<00:03:51.489> this<00:03:51.909> is<00:03:52.060> a<00:03:52.090> book<00:03:52.799> so<00:03:54.239> the

00:03:55.229 --> 00:03:55.239 
that called again this is a book so the

00:03:55.239 --> 00:03:58.199 
that called again this is a book so the
track<00:03:55.480> has<00:03:55.690> 250<00:03:56.560> books<00:03:56.799> on<00:03:57.040> it<00:03:57.159> each<00:03:57.790> one<00:03:58.000> looks

00:03:58.199 --> 00:03:58.209 
track has 250 books on it each one looks

00:03:58.209 --> 00:04:00.420 
track has 250 books on it each one looks
the<00:03:58.329> same<00:03:58.480> as<00:03:58.659> that<00:03:58.829> but<00:03:59.829> these<00:03:59.950> are<00:04:00.010> basically

00:04:00.420 --> 00:04:00.430 
the same as that but these are basically

00:04:00.430 --> 00:04:01.949 
the same as that but these are basically
stupid<00:04:00.970> there's<00:04:01.120> nothing<00:04:01.360> clever<00:04:01.540> about<00:04:01.750> the

00:04:01.949 --> 00:04:01.959 
stupid there's nothing clever about the

00:04:01.959 --> 00:04:04.349 
stupid there's nothing clever about the
book<00:04:02.110> at<00:04:02.260> all<00:04:02.440> and<00:04:03.040> on<00:04:03.340> other<00:04:03.640> sorts<00:04:04.000> of<00:04:04.090> tracks

00:04:04.349 --> 00:04:04.359 
book at all and on other sorts of tracks

00:04:04.359 --> 00:04:06.000 
book at all and on other sorts of tracks
from<00:04:04.540> different<00:04:04.959> manufacturers<00:04:05.440> you<00:04:05.829> might

00:04:06.000 --> 00:04:06.010 
from different manufacturers you might

00:04:06.010 --> 00:04:07.860 
from different manufacturers you might
have<00:04:06.220> a<00:04:06.250> radio<00:04:06.609> frequency<00:04:06.819> check<00:04:07.480> that's<00:04:07.720> at

00:04:07.860 --> 00:04:07.870 
have a radio frequency check that's at

00:04:07.870 --> 00:04:09.630 
have a radio frequency check that's at
the<00:04:07.900> bottom<00:04:07.989> of<00:04:08.349> it<00:04:08.379> so<00:04:09.040> it<00:04:09.280> knows<00:04:09.459> exactly

00:04:09.630 --> 00:04:09.640 
the bottom of it so it knows exactly

00:04:09.640 --> 00:04:12.240 
the bottom of it so it knows exactly
where<00:04:10.150> that<00:04:10.420> poke<00:04:11.170> is<00:04:11.349> on<00:04:11.530> the<00:04:11.680> track<00:04:11.920> at<00:04:12.069> any

00:04:12.240 --> 00:04:12.250 
where that poke is on the track at any

00:04:12.250 --> 00:04:14.640 
where that poke is on the track at any
one<00:04:12.489> time<00:04:12.629> but<00:04:13.629> this<00:04:13.780> one<00:04:13.930> is<00:04:14.049> basically<00:04:14.500> what

00:04:14.640 --> 00:04:14.650 
one time but this one is basically what

00:04:14.650 --> 00:04:17.189 
one time but this one is basically what
you<00:04:14.769> see<00:04:15.010> it's<00:04:15.220> just<00:04:15.280> metal<00:04:15.730> and<00:04:15.879> plastic<00:04:16.329> so

00:04:17.189 --> 00:04:17.199 
you see it's just metal and plastic so

00:04:17.199 --> 00:04:19.529 
you see it's just metal and plastic so
the<00:04:17.350> clever<00:04:17.889> bit<00:04:18.010> and<00:04:18.370> this<00:04:18.489> is<00:04:18.789> the<00:04:19.060> reading

00:04:19.529 --> 00:04:19.539 
the clever bit and this is the reading

00:04:19.539 --> 00:04:21.960 
the clever bit and this is the reading
of<00:04:19.630> the<00:04:19.690> barcodes<00:04:20.260> so<00:04:20.889> that's<00:04:21.070> why<00:04:21.250> different

00:04:21.960 --> 00:04:21.970 
of the barcodes so that's why different

00:04:21.970 --> 00:04:23.670 
of the barcodes so that's why different
points<00:04:22.300> on<00:04:22.419> the<00:04:22.570> track<00:04:22.810> we've<00:04:23.050> got<00:04:23.260> a<00:04:23.289> barcode

00:04:23.670 --> 00:04:23.680 
points on the track we've got a barcode

00:04:23.680 --> 00:04:27.000 
points on the track we've got a barcode
reader<00:04:23.979> that<00:04:24.520> will<00:04:24.699> scan<00:04:25.060> the<00:04:25.389> barcode<00:04:26.020> on<00:04:26.320> the

00:04:27.000 --> 00:04:27.010 
reader that will scan the barcode on the

00:04:27.010 --> 00:04:28.710 
reader that will scan the barcode on the
other<00:04:27.190> sort<00:04:27.490> of<00:04:27.610> track<00:04:27.880> you<00:04:28.030> don't<00:04:28.240> need<00:04:28.419> to<00:04:28.600> be

00:04:28.710 --> 00:04:28.720 
other sort of track you don't need to be

00:04:28.720 --> 00:04:30.689 
other sort of track you don't need to be
so<00:04:28.930> worried<00:04:29.260> because<00:04:29.380> you<00:04:29.620> know<00:04:29.830> which<00:04:30.160> tube

00:04:30.689 --> 00:04:30.699 
so worried because you know which tube

00:04:30.699 --> 00:04:32.670 
so worried because you know which tube
has<00:04:30.729> gone<00:04:31.210> into<00:04:31.330> which<00:04:31.600> sample<00:04:32.139> at<00:04:32.320> the<00:04:32.440> point

00:04:32.670 --> 00:04:32.680 
has gone into which sample at the point

00:04:32.680 --> 00:04:36.119 
has gone into which sample at the point
where<00:04:32.860> it<00:04:32.979> was<00:04:33.100> placed<00:04:33.250> on<00:04:33.520> the<00:04:33.669> track

00:04:36.119 --> 00:04:36.129 

00:04:36.129 --> 00:04:38.369 

so<00:04:36.759> when<00:04:36.909> the<00:04:37.029> tracks<00:04:37.239> running<00:04:37.419> with<00:04:37.629> 250

00:04:38.369 --> 00:04:38.379 
so when the tracks running with 250

00:04:38.379 --> 00:04:41.249 
so when the tracks running with 250
hooks<00:04:39.369> on<00:04:39.610> it<00:04:39.639> it<00:04:39.969> will<00:04:40.029> we<00:04:40.479> only<00:04:40.659> allow<00:04:40.869> it<00:04:41.229> to

00:04:41.249 --> 00:04:41.259 
hooks on it it will we only allow it to

00:04:41.259 --> 00:04:45.209 
hooks on it it will we only allow it to
fill<00:04:41.589> 200<00:04:42.309> of<00:04:42.429> those<00:04:42.580> books<00:04:43.050> because<00:04:44.219> tubes

00:04:45.209 --> 00:04:45.219 
fill 200 of those books because tubes

00:04:45.219 --> 00:04:46.979 
fill 200 of those books because tubes
are<00:04:45.429> constantly<00:04:45.879> going<00:04:46.149> on<00:04:46.449> and<00:04:46.689> off<00:04:46.779> the

00:04:46.979 --> 00:04:46.989 
are constantly going on and off the

00:04:46.989 --> 00:04:49.529 
are constantly going on and off the
track<00:04:47.169> so<00:04:48.039> it's<00:04:48.189> important<00:04:48.729> it<00:04:48.909> is<00:04:49.059> a<00:04:49.119> space

00:04:49.529 --> 00:04:49.539 
track so it's important it is a space

00:04:49.539 --> 00:04:51.419 
track so it's important it is a space
for<00:04:49.929> a<00:04:49.959> tube<00:04:50.259> to<00:04:50.439> come<00:04:50.649> onto<00:04:50.889> the<00:04:51.219> track

00:04:51.419 --> 00:04:51.429 
for a tube to come onto the track

00:04:51.429 --> 00:04:53.209 
for a tube to come onto the track
forming<00:04:51.879> machine<00:04:52.179> when<00:04:52.389> it's<00:04:52.509> been<00:04:52.659> analyzed

00:04:53.209 --> 00:04:53.219 
forming machine when it's been analyzed

00:04:53.219 --> 00:04:56.579 
forming machine when it's been analyzed
so<00:04:54.219> we<00:04:54.399> make<00:04:54.939> sure<00:04:54.969> that<00:04:55.209> 50<00:04:55.809> /<00:04:55.989> books<00:04:56.199> are<00:04:56.409> left

00:04:56.579 --> 00:04:56.589 
so we make sure that 50 / books are left

00:04:56.589 --> 00:04:59.070 
so we make sure that 50 / books are left
empty<00:04:57.069> so<00:04:57.339> that<00:04:57.489> those<00:04:57.610> tracks<00:04:57.939> can<00:04:58.149> be<00:04:58.209> loaded

00:04:59.070 --> 00:04:59.080 
empty so that those tracks can be loaded

00:04:59.080 --> 00:05:00.359 
empty so that those tracks can be loaded
back<00:04:59.379> onto<00:04:59.589> the<00:04:59.830> track<00:05:00.069> when<00:05:00.189> they've<00:05:00.339> been

00:05:00.359 --> 00:05:00.369 
back onto the track when they've been

00:05:00.369 --> 00:05:01.879 
back onto the track when they've been
analyzed<00:05:00.789> at<00:05:00.969> the<00:05:01.029> machine

00:05:01.879 --> 00:05:01.889 
analyzed at the machine

00:05:01.889 --> 00:05:03.949
