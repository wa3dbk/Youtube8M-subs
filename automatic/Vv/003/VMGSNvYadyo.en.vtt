Dominator<00:02:07.680> comes<00:02:07.950> in<00:02:08.160> the<00:02:08.280> two<00:02:08.429> technologies

00:02:08.749 --> 00:02:08.759 
Dominator comes in the two technologies

00:02:08.759 --> 00:02:13.220 
Dominator comes in the two technologies
the<00:02:09.420> FST<00:02:09.899> the<00:02:10.760> parabolic<00:02:11.760> pulsar<00:02:12.239> rails

00:02:14.839 --> 00:02:14.849 
with the air-vent if you remember it's

00:02:14.849 --> 00:02:16.399 
with the air-vent if you remember it's
because<00:02:15.209> there's<00:02:15.480> a<00:02:15.540> lot<00:02:15.720> more<00:02:15.900> air<00:02:16.110> this<00:02:16.230> is<00:02:16.290> a

00:02:16.399 --> 00:02:16.409 
because there's a lot more air this is a

00:02:16.409 --> 00:02:18.680 
because there's a lot more air this is a
one<00:02:16.860> pound<00:02:17.129> core<00:02:17.580> form<00:02:18.000> so<00:02:18.209> there's<00:02:18.360> more<00:02:18.510> air

00:02:18.680 --> 00:02:18.690 
one pound core form so there's more air

00:02:18.690 --> 00:02:21.020 
one pound core form so there's more air
in<00:02:18.840> the<00:02:18.930> core<00:02:19.140> which<00:02:19.950> this<00:02:20.430> valve<00:02:20.670> allows<00:02:20.909> you

in the core which this valve allows you
to<00:02:21.150> breathe<00:02:21.470> this<00:02:22.470> is<00:02:22.620> a<00:02:22.650> two<00:02:22.890> pound<00:02:23.099> call<00:02:24.140> less

00:02:25.130 --> 00:02:25.140 
to breathe this is a two pound call less
