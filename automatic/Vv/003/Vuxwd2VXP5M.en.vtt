00:00:28.880 --> 00:00:28.890 
muscle improvement that's right and the

00:00:28.890 --> 00:00:31.220 
muscle improvement that's right and the
major<00:00:29.160> building<00:00:29.730> blocks<00:00:30.000> of<00:00:30.300> muscles<00:00:30.869> are<00:00:31.080> of

major building blocks of muscles are of

00:00:31.230 --> 00:00:33.860 
major building blocks of muscles are of
course<00:00:31.500> amino<00:00:32.099> acids<00:00:32.489> and<00:00:32.669> a<00:00:33.090> subset<00:00:33.420> of<00:00:33.450> amino

00:00:33.860 --> 00:00:33.870 
course amino acids and a subset of amino

00:00:33.870 --> 00:00:37.760 
course amino acids and a subset of amino
acids<00:00:34.230> bcaas<00:00:35.190> are<00:00:35.399> especially<00:00:35.969> helpful<00:00:36.809> and

00:00:37.760 --> 00:00:37.770 
acids bcaas are especially helpful and

00:00:37.770 --> 00:00:39.080 
acids bcaas are especially helpful and
beneficial<00:00:38.010> to<00:00:38.460> strength<00:00:38.790> and<00:00:38.969> muscle

00:00:39.080 --> 00:00:39.090 
beneficial to strength and muscle

00:00:39.090 --> 00:00:41.750 
beneficial to strength and muscle
building<00:00:39.540> because<00:00:39.930> they<00:00:40.410> actually<00:00:41.100> are

00:00:41.750 --> 00:00:41.760 
building because they actually are

00:00:41.760 --> 00:00:44.119 
building because they actually are
absorbed<00:00:42.300> directly<00:00:42.629> into<00:00:42.930> the<00:00:43.800> muscles

00:00:44.119 --> 00:00:44.129 
absorbed directly into the muscles

00:00:44.129 --> 00:00:46.310 
absorbed directly into the muscles
that's<00:00:44.730> right<00:00:44.879> and<00:00:45.149> another<00:00:45.539> aspect<00:00:46.140> of

00:00:46.310 --> 00:00:46.320 
that's right and another aspect of

00:00:46.320 --> 00:00:48.770 
that's right and another aspect of
adrenal<00:00:46.710> aid<00:00:46.890> is<00:00:47.129> that<00:00:47.610> it<00:00:47.760> works<00:00:48.120> as<00:00:48.300> a<00:00:48.329> nitric

00:00:48.770 --> 00:00:48.780 
adrenal aid is that it works as a nitric

00:00:48.780 --> 00:00:51.049 
adrenal aid is that it works as a nitric
oxide<00:00:49.230> booster<00:00:49.860> now<00:00:50.370> in<00:00:50.520> that<00:00:50.610> of<00:00:50.730> course<00:00:50.910> is

00:00:51.049 --> 00:00:51.059 
oxide booster now in that of course is

00:00:51.059 --> 00:00:52.340 
oxide booster now in that of course is
going<00:00:51.210> to<00:00:51.300> help<00:00:51.510> with<00:00:51.660> blood<00:00:51.960> flow<00:00:52.320> and

00:00:52.340 --> 00:00:52.350 
going to help with blood flow and

00:00:52.350 --> 00:00:55.639 
going to help with blood flow and
nutrient<00:00:53.039> absorption<00:00:53.100> so<00:00:54.000> that<00:00:54.300> your<00:00:55.050> muscles

00:00:55.639 --> 00:00:55.649 
nutrient absorption so that your muscles

00:00:55.649 --> 00:00:57.770 
nutrient absorption so that your muscles
are<00:00:55.770> able<00:00:55.949> to<00:00:56.039> be<00:00:56.160> nourished<00:00:56.670> as<00:00:56.879> well<00:00:57.239> as<00:00:57.510> to

00:00:57.770 --> 00:00:57.780 
are able to be nourished as well as to

00:00:57.780 --> 00:01:00.619 
are able to be nourished as well as to
recover<00:00:58.170> a<00:00:58.410> lot<00:00:59.070> quicker<00:00:59.489> which<00:00:59.969> is<00:01:00.149> huge<00:01:00.539> you

00:01:00.619 --> 00:01:00.629 
recover a lot quicker which is huge you

00:01:00.629 --> 00:01:01.939 
recover a lot quicker which is huge you
know<00:01:00.660> the<00:01:00.750> fast<00:01:00.960> you<00:01:01.109> can<00:01:01.230> recover<00:01:01.469> the<00:01:01.739> more

00:01:01.939 --> 00:01:01.949 
know the fast you can recover the more

00:01:01.949 --> 00:01:04.729 
know the fast you can recover the more
you<00:01:02.039> can<00:01:02.190> work<00:01:02.820> out<00:01:03.059> now<00:01:03.570> nitric<00:01:03.930> oxide<00:01:04.320> is<00:01:04.559> one

00:01:04.729 --> 00:01:04.739 
you can work out now nitric oxide is one

00:01:04.739 --> 00:01:07.310 
you can work out now nitric oxide is one
of<00:01:04.830> those<00:01:04.920> few<00:01:05.250> chemicals<00:01:05.610> that<00:01:06.119> can<00:01:06.420> cross

00:01:07.310 --> 00:01:07.320 
of those few chemicals that can cross

00:01:07.320 --> 00:01:10.310 
of those few chemicals that can cross
between<00:01:07.820> the<00:01:08.820> blood-brain<00:01:09.270> barrier<00:01:09.320> which

00:01:10.310 --> 00:01:10.320 
between the blood-brain barrier which

00:01:10.320 --> 00:01:11.810 
between the blood-brain barrier which
just<00:01:10.619> kind<00:01:10.770> of<00:01:10.799> guarantees<00:01:11.369> that<00:01:11.400> you<00:01:11.700> going

00:01:11.810 --> 00:01:11.820 
just kind of guarantees that you going

00:01:11.820 --> 00:01:13.100 
just kind of guarantees that you going
to<00:01:11.880> be<00:01:11.939> able<00:01:11.970> to<00:01:12.150> see<00:01:12.270> those<00:01:12.420> results<00:01:12.570> without

00:01:13.100 --> 00:01:13.110 
to be able to see those results without

00:01:13.110 --> 00:01:15.230 
to be able to see those results without
kind<00:01:13.500> of<00:01:13.650> the<00:01:14.189> bloating<00:01:14.640> or<00:01:14.760> other<00:01:14.939> side
