00:00:08.870 --> 00:00:08.880 
on leader Danso I've had a growing

00:00:08.880 --> 00:00:11.749 
on leader Danso I've had a growing
fascination<00:00:09.650> with<00:00:10.650> the<00:00:10.769> human<00:00:11.099> condition<00:00:11.250> and

fascination with the human condition and

00:00:11.759 --> 00:00:14.330 
fascination with the human condition and
the<00:00:12.599> means<00:00:12.870> by<00:00:13.080> which<00:00:13.110> it's<00:00:13.559> possible<00:00:14.099> to

00:00:14.330 --> 00:00:14.340 
the means by which it's possible to

00:00:14.340 --> 00:00:16.820 
the means by which it's possible to
express<00:00:14.969> facets<00:00:15.599> of<00:00:15.719> humanity<00:00:16.320> within<00:00:16.650> a

theatrical<00:00:17.340> context<00:00:18.000> I've<00:00:18.869> really<00:00:19.410> been

00:00:19.490 --> 00:00:19.500 
theatrical context I've really been

00:00:19.500 --> 00:00:21.740 
theatrical context I've really been
interested<00:00:19.800> in<00:00:20.070> capturing<00:00:20.369> both<00:00:20.670> the<00:00:21.150> primal

00:00:21.740 --> 00:00:21.750 
interested in capturing both the primal

00:00:21.750 --> 00:00:23.990 
interested in capturing both the primal
nature<00:00:21.869> of<00:00:22.289> humanity<00:00:22.740> in<00:00:23.310> terms<00:00:23.670> of<00:00:23.850> our

00:00:23.990 --> 00:00:24.000 
nature of humanity in terms of our

00:00:24.000 --> 00:00:27.109 
nature of humanity in terms of our
animal<00:00:24.359> needs<00:00:24.570> our<00:00:24.930> sense<00:00:25.170> of<00:00:25.320> urgency<00:00:26.119> I've

00:00:27.109 --> 00:00:27.119 
animal needs our sense of urgency I've

00:00:27.119 --> 00:00:29.450 
animal needs our sense of urgency I've
got<00:00:27.390> responses<00:00:28.050> our<00:00:28.199> reaction<00:00:28.619> speeds<00:00:29.010> and

00:00:29.450 --> 00:00:29.460 
got responses our reaction speeds and

00:00:29.460 --> 00:00:31.999 
got responses our reaction speeds and
how<00:00:30.240> in<00:00:30.390> humans<00:00:30.779> these<00:00:30.960> responses<00:00:31.470> also<00:00:31.800> met

00:00:31.999 --> 00:00:32.009 
how in humans these responses also met

00:00:32.009 --> 00:00:34.069 
how in humans these responses also met
with<00:00:32.040> a<00:00:32.160> kind<00:00:32.399> of<00:00:32.460> intelligent<00:00:33.329> reasoning<00:00:33.899> I

00:00:34.069 --> 00:00:34.079 
with a kind of intelligent reasoning I

00:00:34.079 --> 00:00:36.290 
with a kind of intelligent reasoning I
suppose<00:00:34.440> there<00:00:34.739> are<00:00:34.890> our<00:00:35.160> ability<00:00:36.120> to

00:00:36.290 --> 00:00:36.300 
suppose there are our ability to

00:00:36.300 --> 00:00:39.049 
suppose there are our ability to
question<00:00:36.980> logical<00:00:37.980> thought<00:00:38.280> the<00:00:38.700> way<00:00:38.820> that<00:00:38.969> we

00:00:39.049 --> 00:00:39.059 
question logical thought the way that we

00:00:39.059 --> 00:00:40.220 
question logical thought the way that we
thinks<00:00:39.360> things<00:00:39.540> through<00:00:39.660> this<00:00:39.930> that's

00:00:40.220 --> 00:00:40.230 
thinks things through this that's

00:00:40.230 --> 00:00:42.619 
thinks things through this that's
different<00:00:40.649> from<00:00:40.739> animals<00:00:41.329> and<00:00:42.329> I<00:00:42.450> have<00:00:42.600> a

00:00:42.619 --> 00:00:42.629 
different from animals and I have a

00:00:42.629 --> 00:00:44.510 
different from animals and I have a
developed<00:00:43.320> a<00:00:43.440> kind<00:00:43.620> of<00:00:43.710> interested<00:00:44.280> in<00:00:44.370> how

00:00:44.510 --> 00:00:44.520 
developed a kind of interested in how

00:00:44.520 --> 00:00:46.400 
developed a kind of interested in how
both<00:00:44.760> these<00:00:44.969> sides<00:00:45.239> meet<00:00:45.600> to<00:00:45.989> form<00:00:46.020> our

00:00:46.400 --> 00:00:46.410 
both these sides meet to form our

00:00:46.410 --> 00:00:49.459 
both these sides meet to form our
humanity<00:00:47.039> and<00:00:47.850> what's<00:00:48.149> interesting<00:00:48.360> is<00:00:49.020> how

00:00:49.459 --> 00:00:49.469 
humanity and what's interesting is how

00:00:49.469 --> 00:00:52.310 
humanity and what's interesting is how
these<00:00:49.680> this<00:00:50.070> this<00:00:50.520> tension<00:00:50.820> between<00:00:51.320> these

00:00:52.310 --> 00:00:52.320 
these this this tension between these

00:00:52.320 --> 00:00:54.500 
these this this tension between these
two<00:00:52.500> sides<00:00:52.770> meeting<00:00:53.460> in<00:00:53.610> a<00:00:53.699> relationship<00:00:54.120> and

00:00:54.500 --> 00:00:54.510 
two sides meeting in a relationship and

00:00:54.510 --> 00:00:56.840 
two sides meeting in a relationship and
how<00:00:54.600> this<00:00:54.780> forms<00:00:55.199> and<00:00:55.379> really<00:00:55.739> that<00:00:56.309> tension

00:00:56.840 --> 00:00:56.850 
how this forms and really that tension

00:00:56.850 --> 00:00:59.119 
how this forms and really that tension
is<00:00:57.059> what<00:00:57.510> creates<00:00:58.079> the<00:00:58.140> content<00:00:58.590> of<00:00:58.680> most<00:00:59.010> of

00:00:59.119 --> 00:00:59.129 
is what creates the content of most of

00:00:59.129 --> 00:01:05.030 
is what creates the content of most of
my<00:00:59.250> work

00:01:05.030 --> 00:01:05.040 

00:01:05.040 --> 00:01:07.850

00:01:32.999 --> 00:01:33.009 
space of waiting there's so much space

00:01:33.009 --> 00:01:35.219 
space of waiting there's so much space
that<00:01:33.399> what<00:01:33.549> happens<00:01:33.850> in<00:01:34.119> the<00:01:34.570> waiting<00:01:34.930> is<00:01:35.080> that

we see them and living for what they are

00:01:36.970 --> 00:01:39.359 
we see them and living for what they are
and<00:01:37.360> they<00:01:38.229> go<00:01:38.380> through<00:01:38.590> every<00:01:38.800> spectrum<00:01:39.159> of

00:01:39.359 --> 00:01:39.369

hopelessness to boredom frustration pain

00:01:45.250 --> 00:01:48.359 
hopelessness to boredom frustration pain
anger<00:01:46.119> but<00:01:46.840> it's<00:01:46.990> all<00:01:47.170> built<00:01:47.409> around<00:01:47.979> the<00:01:48.159> kind

00:01:48.359 --> 00:01:48.369 
anger but it's all built around the kind

00:01:48.369 --> 00:01:51.330 
anger but it's all built around the kind
of<00:01:48.429> theater<00:01:48.670> of<00:01:48.850> the<00:01:49.210> absurd<00:01:49.450> so<00:01:50.289> so<00:01:51.130> there's

00:01:51.330 --> 00:01:51.340 
of theater of the absurd so so there's

00:01:51.340 --> 00:01:53.700 
of theater of the absurd so so there's
also<00:01:51.490> very<00:01:51.850> kind<00:01:52.090> of<00:01:52.179> comical<00:01:52.659> elements<00:01:53.229> and

00:01:53.700 --> 00:01:53.710 
also very kind of comical elements and

00:01:53.710 --> 00:01:55.260 
also very kind of comical elements and
it<00:01:53.770> creates<00:01:54.100> such<00:01:54.280> a<00:01:54.310> kind<00:01:54.850> of<00:01:54.909> bittersweet

00:01:55.260 --> 00:01:55.270 
it creates such a kind of bittersweet

00:01:55.270 --> 00:01:56.940 
it creates such a kind of bittersweet
tension<00:01:55.899> the<00:01:56.020> work<00:01:56.200> that's<00:01:56.380> that's<00:01:56.890> really

00:01:56.940 --> 00:01:56.950 
tension the work that's that's really

00:01:56.950 --> 00:02:02.800 
tension the work that's that's really
fascinating<00:01:57.429> and<00:01:58.030> interesting<00:01:58.240> to<00:01:58.630> explore

to<00:02:12.140> say<00:02:12.319> that<00:02:12.459> our<00:02:13.459> interpretation<00:02:14.300> of<00:02:14.390> the

00:02:14.530 --> 00:02:14.540 
to say that our interpretation of the

00:02:14.540 --> 00:02:17.559 
to say that our interpretation of the
play<00:02:14.780> expresses<00:02:15.620> something<00:02:16.459> of<00:02:16.910> Samuel

00:02:57.009 --> 00:02:57.019 
happen in it in its true form and we see

00:02:57.019 --> 00:02:58.750 
happen in it in its true form and we see
the<00:02:57.230> characters<00:02:57.650> lives<00:02:57.920> for<00:02:58.430> what<00:02:58.580> they<00:02:58.730> are

00:02:58.750 --> 00:02:58.760 
the characters lives for what they are

00:02:58.760 --> 00:03:01.720 
the characters lives for what they are
and<00:02:59.440> if<00:03:00.440> you<00:03:00.620> believe<00:03:00.769> it's<00:03:01.130> a<00:03:01.220> godless<00:03:01.519> land

00:03:01.720 --> 00:03:01.730 
and if you believe it's a godless land

00:03:01.730 --> 00:03:03.970 
and if you believe it's a godless land
which<00:03:02.090> I<00:03:02.120> suppose<00:03:02.480> arguably<00:03:03.019> it<00:03:03.230> feels<00:03:03.709> like<00:03:03.950> a

00:03:03.970 --> 00:03:03.980 
which I suppose arguably it feels like a

00:03:03.980 --> 00:03:07.360 
which I suppose arguably it feels like a
godless<00:03:04.370> land<00:03:04.930> where<00:03:05.930> nothing<00:03:06.260> happens<00:03:06.440> the

00:03:07.360 --> 00:03:07.370 
godless land where nothing happens the

00:03:07.370 --> 00:03:09.310 
godless land where nothing happens the
characters<00:03:07.850> have<00:03:08.090> nothing<00:03:08.570> to<00:03:08.690> do<00:03:08.840> really<00:03:09.049> but

00:03:09.310 --> 00:03:09.320 
characters have nothing to do really but

00:03:09.320 --> 00:03:11.800 
characters have nothing to do really but
to<00:03:09.500> wait<00:03:09.650> for<00:03:09.950> salvation<00:03:10.340> or<00:03:10.790> maybe<00:03:11.480> an

00:03:11.800 --> 00:03:11.810 
to wait for salvation or maybe an

00:03:11.810 --> 00:03:13.750 
to wait for salvation or maybe an
illusion<00:03:12.470> of<00:03:12.560> salvation<00:03:13.160> would<00:03:13.250> be<00:03:13.370> truer<00:03:13.579> to

00:03:13.750 --> 00:03:13.760 
illusion of salvation would be truer to

00:03:13.760 --> 00:03:17.080 
illusion of salvation would be truer to
say<00:03:14.769> so<00:03:15.769> what<00:03:15.950> they<00:03:16.100> so<00:03:16.400> what<00:03:16.549> happens<00:03:16.910> in<00:03:17.030> that

00:03:17.080 --> 00:03:17.090 
say so what they so what happens in that

00:03:17.090 --> 00:03:18.789 
say so what they so what happens in that
situation<00:03:17.480> is<00:03:17.780> that<00:03:17.810> things<00:03:18.200> become<00:03:18.440> very

00:03:18.789 --> 00:03:18.799 
situation is that things become very

00:03:18.799 --> 00:03:20.770 
situation is that things become very
important<00:03:19.340> to<00:03:19.549> them<00:03:19.730> people<00:03:20.329> become

00:03:20.770 --> 00:03:20.780 
important to them people become

00:03:20.780 --> 00:03:23.979 
important to them people become
important<00:03:21.319> to<00:03:21.470> them<00:03:22.150> perhaps<00:03:23.150> their<00:03:23.690> shoes

00:03:23.979 --> 00:03:23.989 
important to them perhaps their shoes

00:03:23.989 --> 00:03:26.140 
important to them perhaps their shoes
become<00:03:24.890> important<00:03:25.430> to<00:03:25.549> them<00:03:25.700> because<00:03:25.910> there's

00:03:26.140 --> 00:03:26.150 
become important to them because there's

00:03:26.150 --> 00:03:29.550 
become important to them because there's
nothing<00:03:26.269> else<00:03:26.569> so<00:03:26.840> they<00:03:26.870> gain<00:03:27.620> significance

00:03:29.550 --> 00:03:29.560 
nothing else so they gain significance

00:03:29.560 --> 00:03:33.819 
nothing else so they gain significance

is actually setting it in a kind of time

is actually setting it in a kind of time
vacuum<00:03:37.310> so<00:03:38.260> so<00:03:39.260> it<00:03:39.410> is<00:03:39.500> relevant<00:03:39.859> today<00:03:40.130> it's

00:03:47.050 --> 00:03:47.060 
dance company is kind of an interesting

00:03:47.060 --> 00:03:50.140 
dance company is kind of an interesting
twist<00:03:47.569> is<00:03:47.840> that<00:03:47.870> I<00:03:48.019> feel<00:03:48.290> that<00:03:48.500> Beckett<00:03:48.920> is<00:03:49.150> is

00:03:50.140 --> 00:03:50.150 
twist is that I feel that Beckett is is

00:03:50.150 --> 00:03:53.050 
twist is that I feel that Beckett is is
encouraging<00:03:51.019> interpretation<00:03:51.950> in<00:03:52.069> terms<00:03:52.549> of

00:03:53.050 --> 00:03:53.060 
encouraging interpretation in terms of

00:03:53.060 --> 00:03:56.949 
encouraging interpretation in terms of
how<00:03:53.510> we<00:03:53.540> enter<00:03:54.079> this<00:03:54.230> situation<00:03:54.950> so<00:03:55.880> so<00:03:56.840> it

00:03:56.949 --> 00:03:56.959 
how we enter this situation so so it

00:03:56.959 --> 00:03:59.349 
how we enter this situation so so it
does<00:03:57.139> give<00:03:57.440> us<00:03:57.590> freedom<00:03:57.920> to<00:03:58.459> handle<00:03:58.910> the<00:03:59.030> text

00:03:59.349 --> 00:03:59.359 
does give us freedom to handle the text

00:03:59.359 --> 00:04:01.660 
does give us freedom to handle the text
poetically<00:04:00.019> and<00:04:00.410> it<00:04:00.859> also<00:04:01.040> gives<00:04:01.220> us<00:04:01.489> the

00:04:01.660 --> 00:04:01.670 
poetically and it also gives us the

00:04:01.670 --> 00:04:05.050

freedom to to handle it with with
relevant<00:04:05.540> to<00:04:05.720> today's<00:04:06.019> situations<00:04:06.769> and
