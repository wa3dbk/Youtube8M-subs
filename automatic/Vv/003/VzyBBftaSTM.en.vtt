lot of trial and error to cope with this
title<00:00:25.150> and<00:00:25.660> you<00:00:26.140> wouldn't<00:00:26.410> have<00:00:26.590> wanted<00:00:26.740> to

00:00:26.970 --> 00:00:26.980 
title and you wouldn't have wanted to

00:00:26.980 --> 00:00:28.169 
title and you wouldn't have wanted to
give<00:00:27.130> the<00:00:27.220> names<00:00:27.369> of<00:00:27.519> some<00:00:27.640> of<00:00:27.760> the<00:00:27.820> other<00:00:27.939> ones

00:01:54.059 --> 00:01:54.069 
introducing you to what our new show is

00:01:54.069 --> 00:01:56.129 
introducing you to what our new show is
going<00:01:54.219> to<00:01:54.369> accomplish<00:01:54.639> i<00:01:55.119> also<00:01:55.630> want<00:01:55.780> to<00:01:55.929> talk

00:01:56.129 --> 00:01:56.139 
going to accomplish i also want to talk

00:01:56.139 --> 00:01:58.620 
going to accomplish i also want to talk
to<00:01:56.259> you<00:01:56.319> about<00:01:56.380> how<00:01:56.590> we<00:01:56.649> operate<00:01:57.189> our<00:01:57.490> style<00:01:58.420> if

00:01:58.620 --> 00:01:58.630 
to you about how we operate our style if

00:01:58.630 --> 00:02:00.809 
to you about how we operate our style if
you<00:01:58.659> will<00:01:58.979> sometimes<00:01:59.979> it's<00:02:00.159> best<00:02:00.369> to<00:02:00.549> first

00:02:00.809 --> 00:02:00.819 
you will sometimes it's best to first

00:02:00.819 --> 00:02:02.779 
you will sometimes it's best to first
give<00:02:01.030> a<00:02:01.060> quick<00:02:01.270> example<00:02:01.299> of<00:02:01.840> what<00:02:02.259> we're<00:02:02.380> not

00:02:02.779 --> 00:02:02.789 
give a quick example of what we're not

00:02:02.789 --> 00:02:05.429 
give a quick example of what we're not
we<00:02:03.789> don't<00:02:03.819> think<00:02:04.209> log<00:02:04.600> computing<00:02:05.020> is<00:02:05.109> going<00:02:05.350> to

00:02:05.429 --> 00:02:05.439 
we don't think log computing is going to

00:02:05.439 --> 00:02:07.020 
we don't think log computing is going to
be<00:02:05.530> able<00:02:05.619> to<00:02:05.799> boil<00:02:05.979> the<00:02:06.130> ocean<00:02:06.159> anytime<00:02:06.789> soon

00:02:07.020 --> 00:02:07.030 
be able to boil the ocean anytime soon

00:02:07.030 --> 00:02:09.330 
be able to boil the ocean anytime soon
and<00:02:07.289> we<00:02:08.289> don't<00:02:08.500> believe<00:02:08.800> that<00:02:08.860> cloud

00:02:09.330 --> 00:02:09.340 
and we don't believe that cloud

00:02:09.340 --> 00:02:11.640 
and we don't believe that cloud
computing<00:02:09.940> is<00:02:10.060> a<00:02:10.119> miracle<00:02:10.869> cure<00:02:11.080> for<00:02:11.319> any<00:02:11.470> and

00:02:11.640 --> 00:02:11.650 
computing is a miracle cure for any and

00:02:11.650 --> 00:02:14.010 
computing is a miracle cure for any and
all<00:02:11.680> challenges<00:02:12.190> facing<00:02:12.400> IT<00:02:12.700> and<00:02:13.360> we<00:02:13.870> don't

00:02:14.010 --> 00:02:14.020 
all challenges facing IT and we don't

00:02:14.020 --> 00:02:16.200 
all challenges facing IT and we don't
see<00:02:14.260> it<00:02:14.350> as<00:02:14.500> simply<00:02:14.770> a<00:02:14.860> web<00:02:15.160> platform<00:02:15.370> renamed

00:02:16.200 --> 00:02:16.210 
see it as simply a web platform renamed

00:02:16.210 --> 00:02:19.170 
see it as simply a web platform renamed
to<00:02:16.390> say<00:02:16.660> cloud<00:02:16.960> on<00:02:17.260> the<00:02:18.130> flip<00:02:18.370> side<00:02:18.400> we<00:02:18.940> also

00:02:19.170 --> 00:02:19.180 
to say cloud on the flip side we also

00:02:19.180 --> 00:02:20.400 
to say cloud on the flip side we also
don't<00:02:19.540> see<00:02:19.750> cloud

00:02:20.400 --> 00:02:20.410 
don't see cloud

00:02:20.410 --> 00:02:22.290 
don't see cloud
so<00:02:20.650> complex<00:02:21.100> and<00:02:21.460> convoluted<00:02:21.610> that<00:02:22.150> it<00:02:22.210> will

so complex and convoluted that it will

so complex and convoluted that it will

here is that we understand that
