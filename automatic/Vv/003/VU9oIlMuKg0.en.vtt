00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.640
 hello good afternoon we are in juliaca de 

00:00:02.790 --> 00:00:07.529
 unicenter and I'm presenting in yoga is 

00:00:05.640 --> 00:00:09.960
 say the new collection of Jimmy Manyi 

00:00:07.529 --> 00:00:12.719
 first of all to prepare the skin 

00:00:09.960 --> 00:00:15.210
 I always put a balm if in this 

00:00:12.719 --> 00:00:17.310
 case as a lip band as well as protect 

00:00:15.210 --> 00:00:19.770
 the lips also protect the area of 

00:00:17.310 --> 00:00:22.260
 the eyes so that it increases and 

00:00:19.770 --> 00:00:24.600
 then the proofreader runs very well and what 

00:00:22.260 --> 00:00:26.849
 I do with a hydras park link that is 

00:00:24.600 --> 00:00:28.619
 ideal for before the makeup then 

00:00:26.849 --> 00:00:30.689
 place a tonic with a little bit of 

00:00:28.619 --> 00:00:34.020
 cotton just to remove some 

00:00:30.689 --> 00:00:35.910
 grease or some kind of society that 

00:00:34.020 --> 00:00:39.270
 I can have the skin the first thing I did 

00:00:35.910 --> 00:00:43.200
 it was the eyes with this monkey that is called 

00:00:39.270 --> 00:00:46.920
 three indigo that has four very blue 

00:00:43.200 --> 00:00:49.140
 deep 6 almost navy blue like 

00:00:46.920 --> 00:00:51.660
 I was telling you before at least but you have 

00:00:49.140 --> 00:00:54.300
 one that has a lot of iridescence I used it 

00:00:51.660 --> 00:00:58.590
 as a termination and the rest happens 

00:00:54.300 --> 00:01:01.680
 of base for that before mark also 

00:00:58.590 --> 00:01:05.129
 with a call of eyes the number 16 that is 

00:01:01.680 --> 00:01:07.650
 new and it's divine is almost black but 

00:01:05.129 --> 00:01:10.590
 to accentuate the effect of blue what 

00:01:07.650 --> 00:01:12.660
 I did was mark with a line the blue that 

00:01:10.590 --> 00:01:16.050
 it's number 3, I love it because 

00:01:12.660 --> 00:01:20.330
 It also has silicones and latex then 

00:01:16.050 --> 00:01:22.220
 they shine I also put blue below 

00:01:20.330 --> 00:01:24.620
 top and that a little with shadows 

00:01:22.220 --> 00:01:26.750
 iridescent and inside the eye I put 

00:01:24.620 --> 00:01:28.790
 white because it is very nice although 

00:01:26.750 --> 00:01:31.520
 this winter you can see the big eye 

00:01:28.790 --> 00:01:33.860
 and with great power and again from the 

00:01:31.520 --> 00:01:35.780
 collection that is ideal for makeup 

00:01:33.860 --> 00:01:38.390
 but for girls who love each other 

00:01:35.780 --> 00:01:40.550
 make up all the time and they are ls 

00:01:38.390 --> 00:01:42.200
 asked a little bit the line is the most 

00:01:40.550 --> 00:01:45.110
 perfect 

00:01:42.200 --> 00:01:47.270
 If it's like a volatine, you're 

00:01:45.110 --> 00:01:49.909
 spectacular really if I was wrong 

00:01:47.270 --> 00:01:52.640
 in the delineate or if something was left out 

00:01:49.909 --> 00:01:55.549
 place it deleted and obviously I finished everything 

00:01:52.640 --> 00:01:57.890
 the makeup with the phenomenal is that it is 

00:01:55.549 --> 00:02:00.920
 the best you have and see if what more 

00:01:57.890 --> 00:02:02.990
 I love and ringo using a long time ago 

00:02:00.920 --> 00:02:05.390
 love in this case I put a little bit of 

00:02:02.990 --> 00:02:07.729
 waterproof because she tends to have a 

00:02:05.390 --> 00:02:09.830
 little wet eye 

00:02:07.729 --> 00:02:12.680
 then you can to avoid any 

00:02:09.830 --> 00:02:14.690
 type of liquid drop and that put him 

00:02:12.680 --> 00:02:17.660
 the waterproof that does not hurt the eyelashes 

00:02:14.690 --> 00:02:20.470
 on the contrary that is the work that I did 

00:02:17.660 --> 00:02:20.470
 with julieta today
