00:02:10.910 --> 00:02:13.450 
think they came out so great and they're
just<00:02:11.090> so<00:02:11.330> elegant<00:02:11.540> I<00:02:12.050> know<00:02:12.200> I<00:02:12.590> just<00:02:12.620> love<00:02:13.160> the

00:02:13.450 --> 00:02:13.460 
just so elegant I know I just love the

00:02:13.460 --> 00:02:15.550 
just so elegant I know I just love the
curves<00:02:13.730> it<00:02:14.030> really<00:02:14.570> makes<00:02:14.780> a<00:02:14.930> great<00:02:15.170> design

00:02:15.550 --> 00:02:15.560 
curves it really makes a great design

00:02:15.560 --> 00:02:17.590 
curves it really makes a great design
statement<00:02:15.890> in<00:02:16.220> this<00:02:16.310> project<00:02:16.820> I<00:02:17.030> tell<00:02:17.360> you<00:02:17.450> why

00:02:17.590 --> 00:02:17.600 
statement in this project I tell you why

00:02:17.600 --> 00:02:19.240 
statement in this project I tell you why
it<00:02:17.660> works<00:02:17.930> too<00:02:18.230> because<00:02:18.560> we<00:02:18.710> have<00:02:18.860> the<00:02:18.950> curves

00:02:19.240 --> 00:02:19.250 
it works too because we have the curves

00:02:19.250 --> 00:02:21.040 
it works too because we have the curves
of<00:02:19.490> the<00:02:19.550> step<00:02:19.940> and<00:02:20.210> we<00:02:20.390> have<00:02:20.480> the<00:02:20.570> curve<00:02:20.810> of<00:02:20.990> the

00:02:21.040 --> 00:02:21.050 
of the step and we have the curve of the

00:02:21.050 --> 00:02:23.350 
of the step and we have the curve of the
outdoor<00:02:21.440> kitchen<00:02:21.470> that<00:02:21.980> fits<00:02:22.250> into<00:02:22.520> it<00:02:22.790> but

00:02:23.350 --> 00:02:23.360 
outdoor kitchen that fits into it but

00:02:23.360 --> 00:02:25.210 
outdoor kitchen that fits into it but
it's<00:02:23.480> contrasted<00:02:24.350> against<00:02:24.620> what<00:02:24.830> we<00:02:24.860> did<00:02:25.130> the

00:02:25.210 --> 00:02:25.220 
it's contrasted against what we did the

00:02:25.220 --> 00:02:26.890 
it's contrasted against what we did the
straight<00:02:25.580> lines<00:02:25.910> of<00:02:26.180> the<00:02:26.270> terracing<00:02:26.750> it

00:02:26.890 --> 00:02:26.900 
straight lines of the terracing it

00:02:26.900 --> 00:02:28.840 
straight lines of the terracing it
really<00:02:27.440> just<00:02:27.620> becomes<00:02:27.920> a<00:02:28.040> nice<00:02:28.250> composition

00:02:28.840 --> 00:02:28.850 
really just becomes a nice composition

00:02:28.850 --> 00:02:31.120 
really just becomes a nice composition
it<00:02:29.540> does<00:02:29.810> Tony<00:02:30.080> and<00:02:30.350> you<00:02:30.380> know<00:02:30.530> because<00:02:30.950> this

00:02:31.120 --> 00:02:31.130 
it does Tony and you know because this

00:02:31.130 --> 00:02:33.760 
it does Tony and you know because this
is<00:02:31.310> such<00:02:31.520> a<00:02:31.550> large<00:02:31.970> patio<00:02:32.390> system<00:02:33.110> we<00:02:33.500> wanted

00:02:33.760 --> 00:02:33.770 
is such a large patio system we wanted

00:02:33.770 --> 00:02:35.350 
is such a large patio system we wanted
to<00:02:33.860> make<00:02:34.040> sure<00:02:34.070> the<00:02:34.459> guests<00:02:34.850> had<00:02:35.000> lots<00:02:35.209> of

00:02:35.350 --> 00:02:35.360 
to make sure the guests had lots of

00:02:35.360 --> 00:02:37.630 
to make sure the guests had lots of
options<00:02:35.600> to<00:02:35.900> get<00:02:36.110> down<00:02:36.350> here<00:02:36.740> so<00:02:37.310> we<00:02:37.340> did

00:02:37.630 --> 00:02:37.640 
options to get down here so we did

00:02:37.640 --> 00:02:39.550 
options to get down here so we did
install<00:02:38.150> another<00:02:38.510> stairwell<00:02:39.110> on<00:02:39.170> the<00:02:39.380> other

00:02:39.550 --> 00:02:39.560 
install another stairwell on the other

00:02:39.560 --> 00:02:42.250 
install another stairwell on the other
side<00:02:39.920> of<00:02:39.950> the<00:02:40.220> project<00:02:40.400> but<00:02:41.360> we<00:02:41.810> wanted<00:02:42.110> the

00:02:42.250 --> 00:02:42.260 
side of the project but we wanted the

00:02:42.260 --> 00:02:44.590 
side of the project but we wanted the
main<00:02:42.590> focal<00:02:43.310> point<00:02:43.520> to<00:02:43.700> be<00:02:43.940> the<00:02:44.180> circular

00:02:44.590 --> 00:02:44.600 
main focal point to be the circular

00:02:44.600 --> 00:02:46.300 
main focal point to be the circular
stairs<00:02:44.900> that's<00:02:45.380> right<00:02:45.590> and<00:02:45.860> the<00:02:45.950> set<00:02:46.160> the

00:02:46.300 --> 00:02:46.310 
stairs that's right and the set the

00:02:46.310 --> 00:02:48.040 
stairs that's right and the set the
stairs<00:02:46.610> because<00:02:46.880> they're<00:02:47.300> circular<00:02:47.750> you<00:02:47.930> can

00:02:48.040 --> 00:02:48.050 
stairs because they're circular you can

00:02:48.050 --> 00:02:50.830 
stairs because they're circular you can
see<00:02:48.290> how<00:02:48.530> the<00:02:48.980> radius<00:02:49.400> comes<00:02:49.670> down<00:02:49.880> continues

00:02:50.830 --> 00:02:50.840 
see how the radius comes down continues

00:02:50.840 --> 00:02:52.870 
see how the radius comes down continues
right<00:02:51.110> into<00:02:51.470> this<00:02:51.590> circle<00:02:52.010> pattern<00:02:52.400> down<00:02:52.550> here

00:02:52.870 --> 00:02:52.880 
right into this circle pattern down here

00:02:52.880 --> 00:02:55.840 
right into this circle pattern down here
it's<00:02:53.180> just<00:02:53.300> a<00:02:53.720> great<00:02:54.170> thought<00:02:54.590> out<00:02:54.800> plan<00:02:55.010> it<00:02:55.610> is

00:02:55.840 --> 00:02:55.850 
it's just a great thought out plan it is

00:02:55.850 --> 00:02:58.270 
it's just a great thought out plan it is
I<00:02:56.180> like<00:02:56.420> these<00:02:56.600> pavers<00:02:56.959> that<00:02:57.170> we<00:02:57.380> chose<00:02:57.650> you

00:02:58.270 --> 00:02:58.280 
I like these pavers that we chose you

00:02:58.280 --> 00:03:00.010 
I like these pavers that we chose you
know<00:02:58.370> we<00:02:58.520> use<00:02:58.640> the<00:02:58.820> same<00:02:58.850> papers<00:02:59.540> that<00:02:59.690> we<00:02:59.780> used

00:03:00.010 --> 00:03:00.020 
know we use the same papers that we used

00:03:00.020 --> 00:03:01.479 
know we use the same papers that we used
up<00:03:00.230> there<00:03:00.410> but<00:03:00.590> now<00:03:00.739> it's<00:03:00.920> in<00:03:01.040> a<00:03:01.130> circle

00:03:01.479 --> 00:03:01.489 
up there but now it's in a circle

00:03:01.489 --> 00:03:03.100 
up there but now it's in a circle
pattern<00:03:01.880> just<00:03:02.300> to<00:03:02.390> create<00:03:02.780> a<00:03:02.870> little

00:03:03.100 --> 00:03:03.110 
pattern just to create a little

00:03:03.110 --> 00:03:04.540 
pattern just to create a little
different<00:03:03.470> feel<00:03:03.620> a<00:03:03.650> different<00:03:04.130> room<00:03:04.310> out<00:03:04.519> here

00:03:04.540 --> 00:03:04.550 
different feel a different room out here

00:03:04.550 --> 00:03:08.890 
different feel a different room out here
