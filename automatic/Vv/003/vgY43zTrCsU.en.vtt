I<00:01:06.119> felt<00:01:06.750> that<00:01:06.840> everything<00:01:07.170> was<00:01:07.350> slowly

00:01:07.850 --> 00:01:07.860 
I felt that everything was slowly

I felt that everything was slowly
getting<00:01:08.100> worse<00:01:08.460> and<00:01:08.820> I<00:01:09.479> was<00:01:10.260> working<00:01:10.680> harder

getting worse and I was working harder

00:01:11.070 --> 00:01:13.880 
getting worse and I was working harder
and<00:01:11.909> it<00:01:12.420> just<00:01:12.630> wasn't<00:01:12.960> working<00:01:13.140> I<00:01:13.470> went<00:01:13.799> to

00:01:13.880 --> 00:01:13.890 
and it just wasn't working I went to

00:01:13.890 --> 00:01:16.760 
and it just wasn't working I went to
other<00:01:14.010> doctors<00:01:14.490> and<00:01:15.200> the<00:01:16.200> only<00:01:16.439> thing<00:01:16.619> I

00:01:16.760 --> 00:01:16.770 
other doctors and the only thing I

00:01:16.770 --> 00:01:18.920 
other doctors and the only thing I
talked<00:01:17.040> about<00:01:17.280> was<00:01:17.400> fusion<00:01:17.909> and<00:01:18.119> that<00:01:18.570> to<00:01:18.750> me

00:01:18.920 --> 00:01:18.930 
talked about was fusion and that to me

00:01:18.930 --> 00:01:20.899 
talked about was fusion and that to me
it<00:01:19.650> didn't<00:01:19.920> seem<00:01:20.009> like<00:01:20.189> the<00:01:20.310> complete<00:01:20.700> answer

00:01:20.899 --> 00:01:20.909 
it didn't seem like the complete answer

00:01:20.909 --> 00:01:23.870 
it didn't seem like the complete answer
because<00:01:21.650> it<00:01:22.650> would<00:01:22.799> leave<00:01:22.979> my<00:01:23.220> area<00:01:23.640> where<00:01:23.790> the

00:01:23.870 --> 00:01:23.880 
because it would leave my area where the

00:01:23.880 --> 00:01:26.270 
because it would leave my area where the
scoliosis<00:01:24.299> was<00:01:24.750> very<00:01:25.049> vulnerable<00:01:25.320> and<00:01:25.860> I<00:01:26.009> felt

00:01:26.270 --> 00:01:26.280 
scoliosis was very vulnerable and I felt

00:01:26.280 --> 00:01:27.710 
scoliosis was very vulnerable and I felt
like<00:01:26.369> I'd<00:01:26.520> be<00:01:26.640> going<00:01:26.880> in<00:01:27.000> for<00:01:27.210> another<00:01:27.240> fusion

00:01:27.710 --> 00:01:27.720 
like I'd be going in for another fusion

that<00:02:00.659> I<00:02:00.689> felt<00:02:01.049> like<00:02:01.200> I<00:02:01.289> needed<00:02:01.500> surgery<00:02:01.770> or<00:02:02.310> I

00:02:02.330 --> 00:02:02.340 
that I felt like I needed surgery or I

00:02:02.340 --> 00:02:03.969 
that I felt like I needed surgery or I
was<00:02:02.640> going<00:02:02.819> to<00:02:02.909> do<00:02:03.060> permanent<00:02:03.600> nerve<00:02:03.750> damage

00:02:03.969 --> 00:02:03.979 
was going to do permanent nerve damage

00:02:03.979 --> 00:02:07.789 
was going to do permanent nerve damage
and<00:02:04.979> get<00:02:05.250> a<00:02:05.280> permanent<00:02:05.640> rotation<00:02:06.560> my<00:02:07.560> world

00:02:07.789 --> 00:02:07.799 
and get a permanent rotation my world

00:02:07.799 --> 00:02:09.740 
and get a permanent rotation my world
was<00:02:08.039> already<00:02:08.190> any<00:02:08.489> smaller<00:02:08.970> because<00:02:09.269> I<00:02:09.450> found

00:02:09.740 --> 00:02:09.750 
was already any smaller because I found

00:02:09.750 --> 00:02:11.390 
was already any smaller because I found
the<00:02:09.899> only<00:02:10.080> relief<00:02:10.379> was<00:02:10.679> to<00:02:10.860> do<00:02:10.979> nothing<00:02:11.310> but

00:02:11.390 --> 00:02:11.400 
the only relief was to do nothing but

00:02:11.400 --> 00:02:13.280 
the only relief was to do nothing but
lay<00:02:11.580> down<00:02:11.790> so<00:02:12.299> I<00:02:12.330> was<00:02:12.450> laying<00:02:12.690> down<00:02:12.930> more<00:02:13.260> and

00:02:13.280 --> 00:02:13.290 
lay down so I was laying down more and

00:02:13.290 --> 00:02:15.170 
lay down so I was laying down more and
more

00:02:15.170 --> 00:02:15.180 
more

00:02:15.180 --> 00:02:19.670 
more

I contacted Pro spine went through the

00:02:19.680 --> 00:02:24.050 
I contacted Pro spine went through the
paperwork<00:02:20.010> and<00:02:20.420> I<00:02:22.250> set<00:02:23.250> up<00:02:23.280> a<00:02:23.400> surgery<00:02:23.880> date

00:02:24.050 --> 00:02:24.060 
paperwork and I set up a surgery date

00:02:24.060 --> 00:02:26.750 
paperwork and I set up a surgery date
and<00:02:24.329> they<00:02:24.500> really<00:02:25.500> were<00:02:25.709> helpful<00:02:26.370> all<00:02:26.549> the<00:02:26.640> way

00:02:45.800 --> 00:02:45.810 
I'm recuperating I had my surgery three

00:02:45.810 --> 00:02:49.190 
I'm recuperating I had my surgery three
weeks<00:02:46.019> ago<00:02:46.340> was<00:02:47.340> that<00:02:47.850> a<00:02:48.060> dr.<00:02:48.690> Burton<00:02:48.989> early

00:02:49.190 --> 00:02:49.200 
weeks ago was that a dr. Burton early

00:02:49.200 --> 00:02:50.660 
weeks ago was that a dr. Burton early
had<00:02:49.350> an<00:02:49.470> engineering<00:02:49.920> background<00:02:50.100> which<00:02:50.549> i

00:02:50.660 --> 00:02:50.670 
had an engineering background which i

00:02:50.670 --> 00:02:53.629 
had an engineering background which i
think<00:02:50.730> is<00:02:51.000> tremendously<00:02:51.540> helpful<00:02:51.980> be<00:02:52.980> he<00:02:53.400> has

00:02:53.629 --> 00:02:53.639 
think is tremendously helpful be he has

00:02:53.639 --> 00:02:56.289 
think is tremendously helpful be he has
a<00:02:54.000> thirst<00:02:54.600> for<00:02:54.720> knowledge<00:02:54.870> and<00:02:55.530> I<00:02:55.590> think<00:02:55.889> his

00:02:56.289 --> 00:02:56.299 
a thirst for knowledge and I think his

00:02:56.299 --> 00:02:58.910 
a thirst for knowledge and I think his
teaching<00:02:57.299> of<00:02:57.510> other<00:02:57.690> to<00:02:57.900> other<00:02:58.049> surgeons<00:02:58.650> and

00:02:58.910 --> 00:02:58.920 
teaching of other to other surgeons and

00:02:58.920 --> 00:03:01.610 
teaching of other to other surgeons and
continuing<00:02:59.609> and<00:02:59.700> learning<00:03:00.260> keeps<00:03:01.260> him<00:03:01.410> on<00:03:01.530> the

00:03:01.610 --> 00:03:01.620 
continuing and learning keeps him on the

00:03:01.620 --> 00:03:05.539 
continuing and learning keeps him on the
cutting<00:03:01.950> edge<00:03:02.100> of<00:03:02.569> medicine<00:03:04.100> also<00:03:05.100> I<00:03:05.130> think<00:03:05.430> he

00:03:05.539 --> 00:03:05.549 
cutting edge of medicine also I think he

00:03:05.549 --> 00:03:07.039 
cutting edge of medicine also I think he
has<00:03:05.730> a<00:03:05.760> true<00:03:06.150> passion<00:03:06.329> for<00:03:06.600> helping<00:03:06.870> people

00:03:07.039 --> 00:03:07.049 
has a true passion for helping people

00:03:07.049 --> 00:03:09.410 
has a true passion for helping people
and<00:03:07.470> I<00:03:07.590> saw<00:03:07.799> this<00:03:07.980> come<00:03:08.459> through<00:03:08.760> I<00:03:08.790> think<00:03:09.269> that

00:03:09.410 --> 00:03:09.420 
and I saw this come through I think that

00:03:09.420 --> 00:03:10.699 
and I saw this come through I think that
when<00:03:09.569> somebody<00:03:09.930> turns<00:03:10.079> around<00:03:10.319> and<00:03:10.530> says

00:03:10.699 --> 00:03:10.709 
when somebody turns around and says

00:03:10.709 --> 00:03:12.890 
when somebody turns around and says
you've<00:03:11.250> given<00:03:11.609> me<00:03:11.700> a<00:03:11.730> life<00:03:11.910> my<00:03:12.329> life<00:03:12.569> back

00:03:12.890 --> 00:03:12.900 
you've given me a life my life back

00:03:12.900 --> 00:03:16.670 
you've given me a life my life back
that's<00:03:13.859> very<00:03:14.130> rewarding<00:03:14.340> to<00:03:14.670> him<00:03:15.049> I<00:03:16.049> also<00:03:16.380> like

00:03:16.670 --> 00:03:16.680 
that's very rewarding to him I also like

00:03:16.680 --> 00:03:17.990 
that's very rewarding to him I also like
the<00:03:16.799> fact<00:03:16.829> that<00:03:17.130> it<00:03:17.280> was<00:03:17.370> a<00:03:17.400> very<00:03:17.549> small

00:03:17.990 --> 00:03:18.000 
the fact that it was a very small

00:03:18.000 --> 00:03:22.069 
the fact that it was a very small
hospital<00:03:18.690> that<00:03:20.239> there<00:03:21.239> wasn't<00:03:21.450> layers<00:03:21.840> and

00:03:22.069 --> 00:03:22.079 
hospital that there wasn't layers and

00:03:22.079 --> 00:03:24.589 
hospital that there wasn't layers and
layers<00:03:22.230> of<00:03:22.349> red<00:03:22.620> tape<00:03:22.859> and<00:03:23.160> I<00:03:23.730> felt<00:03:24.030> that<00:03:24.150> this

00:03:24.589 --> 00:03:24.599 
layers of red tape and I felt that this

00:03:24.599 --> 00:03:28.970 
layers of red tape and I felt that this
small<00:03:26.329> soothing<00:03:27.329> kind<00:03:27.660> of<00:03:27.780> a<00:03:27.959> country<00:03:28.530> farm

00:03:28.970 --> 00:03:28.980 
small soothing kind of a country farm

00:03:28.980 --> 00:03:31.129 
small soothing kind of a country farm
like<00:03:29.190> setting<00:03:29.609> would<00:03:30.150> be<00:03:30.209> very<00:03:30.540> healing<00:03:30.810> for

00:03:31.129 --> 00:03:31.139 
like setting would be very healing for

00:03:31.139 --> 00:03:33.880 
like setting would be very healing for
me<00:03:31.290> as<00:03:31.500> I<00:03:31.950> was<00:03:32.910> recovering

00:03:33.880 --> 00:03:33.890 
me as I was recovering

00:03:33.890 --> 00:03:36.490 
me as I was recovering
being<00:03:34.220> in<00:03:34.340> a<00:03:34.400> big<00:03:34.550> city<00:03:34.730> hospital<00:03:35.330> with<00:03:35.630> tons

00:03:36.490 --> 00:03:36.500 
being in a big city hospital with tons

00:03:36.500 --> 00:03:37.990 
being in a big city hospital with tons
of<00:03:36.620> red<00:03:36.770> tape<00:03:36.950> of<00:03:37.130> people<00:03:37.520> and<00:03:37.700> you<00:03:37.760> felt<00:03:37.970> like

00:03:37.990 --> 00:03:38.000 
of red tape of people and you felt like

00:03:38.000 --> 00:03:44.080 
of red tape of people and you felt like
you<00:03:38.180> were<00:03:38.209> just<00:03:38.450> a<00:03:38.540> number<00:03:38.690> so<00:03:39.560> that<00:03:41.290> that<00:03:43.090> was

00:03:44.080 --> 00:03:44.090 
you were just a number so that that was

00:03:44.090 --> 00:03:46.030 
you were just a number so that that was
absolutely<00:03:44.690> true<00:03:44.959> everything<00:03:45.770> I<00:03:45.860> thought

00:03:46.030 --> 00:03:46.040 
absolutely true everything I thought

00:03:46.040 --> 00:03:48.190 
absolutely true everything I thought
about<00:03:46.190> this<00:03:46.580> is<00:03:46.910> the<00:03:47.330> whole<00:03:47.480> operation<00:03:47.630> was

00:03:48.190 --> 00:03:48.200 
about this is the whole operation was

00:03:48.200 --> 00:03:50.230 
about this is the whole operation was
even<00:03:48.440> felt<00:03:48.650> very<00:03:48.830> important<00:03:49.280> the<00:03:49.940> aftercare

00:03:50.230 --> 00:03:50.240 
even felt very important the aftercare

00:03:50.240 --> 00:03:53.380 
even felt very important the aftercare
was<00:03:50.660> tremendous<00:03:51.530> I<00:03:51.770> was<00:03:52.700> there<00:03:52.850> for<00:03:53.000> nine<00:03:53.180> days

00:03:53.380 --> 00:03:53.390 
was tremendous I was there for nine days

00:03:53.390 --> 00:03:55.900 
was tremendous I was there for nine days
and<00:03:53.450> I<00:03:53.690> felt<00:03:53.930> like<00:03:54.080> the<00:03:54.200> nurses<00:03:54.590> were<00:03:54.910> always

00:03:55.900 --> 00:03:55.910 
and I felt like the nurses were always

00:03:55.910 --> 00:03:58.660 
and I felt like the nurses were always
monitoring<00:03:56.720> me<00:03:56.900> making<00:03:57.770> sure<00:03:57.920> what<00:03:58.280> happened

00:03:58.660 --> 00:03:58.670 
monitoring me making sure what happened

00:03:58.670 --> 00:04:00.160 
monitoring me making sure what happened
and<00:03:58.820> that's<00:03:59.180> probably<00:03:59.480> why<00:03:59.690> they<00:03:59.840> don't<00:04:00.020> have

00:04:00.160 --> 00:04:00.170 
and that's probably why they don't have

00:04:00.170 --> 00:04:05.140 
and that's probably why they don't have
the<00:04:00.380> affections<00:04:00.920> over<00:04:01.190> here<00:04:01.430> I<00:04:02.920> felt<00:04:03.920> that<00:04:04.250> I

00:04:05.140 --> 00:04:05.150 
the affections over here I felt that I

00:04:05.150 --> 00:04:07.690 
the affections over here I felt that I
was<00:04:05.840> a<00:04:05.870> very<00:04:06.020> complicated<00:04:06.470> case<00:04:07.040> on<00:04:07.340> a<00:04:07.370> scale

00:04:07.690 --> 00:04:07.700 
was a very complicated case on a scale

00:04:07.700 --> 00:04:10.210 
was a very complicated case on a scale
of<00:04:07.820> one<00:04:07.940> to<00:04:07.970> ten<00:04:08.270> I<00:04:08.300> heard<00:04:08.600> I<00:04:08.690> was<00:04:08.840> a<00:04:08.870> ten<00:04:09.200> I<00:04:09.470> went

00:04:10.210 --> 00:04:10.220 
of one to ten I heard I was a ten I went

00:04:10.220 --> 00:04:13.690 
of one to ten I heard I was a ten I went
into<00:04:10.370> the<00:04:10.550> surgery<00:04:10.820> I<00:04:11.030> had<00:04:11.420> scoliosis<00:04:12.340> at<00:04:13.340> l23

00:04:13.690 --> 00:04:13.700 
into the surgery I had scoliosis at l23

00:04:13.700 --> 00:04:17.170 
into the surgery I had scoliosis at l23
I<00:04:14.209> had<00:04:15.050> rotation<00:04:15.650> of<00:04:15.769> the<00:04:15.860> spine<00:04:15.980> my<00:04:16.970> right

00:04:17.170 --> 00:04:17.180 
I had rotation of the spine my right

00:04:17.180 --> 00:04:18.490 
I had rotation of the spine my right
side<00:04:17.419> was<00:04:17.450> rotating<00:04:18.109> forward

00:04:18.490 --> 00:04:18.500 
side was rotating forward

00:04:18.500 --> 00:04:21.729 
side was rotating forward
I<00:04:18.680> had<00:04:19.780> spondylolisthesis<00:04:20.780> I'd<00:04:21.290> had<00:04:21.470> a

00:04:21.729 --> 00:04:21.739 
I had spondylolisthesis I'd had a

00:04:21.739 --> 00:04:24.490 
I had spondylolisthesis I'd had a
half-inch<00:04:22.250> the<00:04:22.880> l4<00:04:23.360> and<00:04:23.390> l5<00:04:23.510> differential<00:04:24.410> was

00:04:24.490 --> 00:04:24.500 
half-inch the l4 and l5 differential was

00:04:24.500 --> 00:04:25.930 
half-inch the l4 and l5 differential was
about<00:04:24.680> a<00:04:24.710> half-inch<00:04:25.160> and<00:04:25.430> then<00:04:25.640> it<00:04:25.760> would

00:04:25.930 --> 00:04:25.940 
about a half-inch and then it would

00:04:25.940 --> 00:04:28.540 
about a half-inch and then it would
slide<00:04:26.750> even<00:04:27.140> more<00:04:27.380> when<00:04:27.560> I<00:04:27.590> did<00:04:27.860> flexure<00:04:28.370> in

00:04:28.540 --> 00:04:28.550 
slide even more when I did flexure in

00:04:28.550 --> 00:04:33.130 
slide even more when I did flexure in
flexion<00:04:29.530> and<00:04:30.530> so<00:04:31.520> going<00:04:31.730> into<00:04:32.030> surgery<00:04:32.300> we

back and one of my compelling reasons
also<00:05:01.160> for<00:05:01.340> coming<00:05:01.490> was<00:05:01.790> that<00:05:01.970> his<00:05:03.250> his<00:05:04.250> desire

00:05:05.110 --> 00:05:05.120 
also for coming was that his his desire

00:05:05.120 --> 00:05:07.840 
also for coming was that his his desire
to<00:05:05.540> keep<00:05:05.810> the<00:05:06.169> motion<00:05:06.470> in<00:05:07.010> your<00:05:07.160> back<00:05:07.370> and<00:05:07.700> the

00:05:07.840 --> 00:05:07.850 
to keep the motion in your back and the

00:05:07.850 --> 00:05:09.670 
to keep the motion in your back and the
flexibility<00:05:08.600> and<00:05:08.780> everything<00:05:09.020> he<00:05:09.440> says

00:05:09.670 --> 00:05:09.680 
flexibility and everything he says

00:05:09.680 --> 00:05:13.480 
flexibility and everything he says
that's<00:05:09.979> his<00:05:10.850> goal<00:05:11.180> and<00:05:11.750> I<00:05:12.470> didn't<00:05:13.160> feel<00:05:13.340> was

States and I think that his expertise
I'm<00:05:18.950> his<00:05:19.160> experience<00:05:19.760> 5,000<00:05:20.600> surgeries<00:05:20.810> his

being on the cutting edge and always
continuing<00:05:25.070> learning<00:05:25.750> gives<00:05:26.750> him<00:05:26.990> in<00:05:27.110> this

00:05:27.190 --> 00:05:27.200 
continuing learning gives him in this

00:05:27.200 --> 00:05:29.770 
continuing learning gives him in this
advantage<00:05:27.800> that<00:05:28.120> for<00:05:29.120> this<00:05:29.210> type<00:05:29.420> of<00:05:29.450> surgery

00:05:29.770 --> 00:05:29.780 
advantage that for this type of surgery

00:05:29.780 --> 00:05:31.840 
advantage that for this type of surgery
what<00:05:30.110> I<00:05:30.140> had<00:05:30.440> done<00:05:30.620> I<00:05:30.680> couldn't<00:05:31.370> get<00:05:31.520> in<00:05:31.790> the

what I had done I couldn't get in the
United<00:05:32.180> States<00:05:32.480> so<00:05:33.380> what<00:05:33.740> happened<00:05:34.130> in<00:05:34.190> the

00:05:34.270 --> 00:05:34.280 
United States so what happened in the

the rest of my life I felt that when I

00:05:55.820 --> 00:05:57.460 
the rest of my life I felt that when I
met<00:05:56.150> him<00:05:56.360> I<00:05:56.510> was<00:05:56.540> a<00:05:56.690> little<00:05:56.840> apprehensive<00:05:57.050> I

00:05:57.460 --> 00:05:57.470 
met him I was a little apprehensive I

00:05:57.470 --> 00:05:58.990 
met him I was a little apprehensive I
