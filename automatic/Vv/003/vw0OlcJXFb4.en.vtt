much<00:01:00.809> like<00:01:00.989> if<00:01:01.350> you're<00:01:01.590> a<00:01:01.620> regular<00:01:01.890> trig<00:01:02.190> liner

00:01:02.330 --> 00:01:02.340 
much like if you're a regular trig liner

00:01:02.340 --> 00:01:03.590 
much like if you're a regular trig liner
and<00:01:02.489> if<00:01:02.579> you<00:01:02.670> watch<00:01:02.879> me<00:01:03.059> whenever<00:01:03.300> you<00:01:03.480> watch

00:01:07.070 --> 00:01:07.080 
everything backwards so say if I'm like

00:01:07.080 --> 00:01:08.750 
everything backwards so say if I'm like
you<00:01:07.200> know<00:01:07.290> if<00:01:07.470> I'm<00:01:07.619> in<00:01:07.680> goofy<00:01:07.890> and<00:01:08.189> if<00:01:08.580> I'm

00:01:08.750 --> 00:01:08.760 
you know if I'm in goofy and if I'm

00:01:08.760 --> 00:01:10.580 
you know if I'm in goofy and if I'm
holding<00:01:09.090> like<00:01:09.479> the<00:01:09.659> left<00:01:09.930> trigger<00:01:10.140> down<00:01:10.439> and

00:01:10.580 --> 00:01:10.590 
holding like the left trigger down and

00:01:10.590 --> 00:01:11.780 
holding like the left trigger down and
pressing<00:01:10.920> X<00:01:11.070> you<00:01:11.250> want<00:01:11.400> to<00:01:11.460> hold<00:01:11.580> the<00:01:11.670> right

00:01:11.780 --> 00:01:11.790 
pressing X you want to hold the right

00:01:11.790 --> 00:01:13.039 
pressing X you want to hold the right
trigger<00:01:11.820> now<00:01:12.090> and<00:01:12.210> press<00:01:12.330> anything<00:01:12.689> you<00:01:12.960> know

00:01:13.039 --> 00:01:13.049 
trigger now and press anything you know

00:01:13.049 --> 00:01:14.179 
trigger now and press anything you know
because<00:01:13.200> you<00:01:13.320> are<00:01:13.830> basically<00:01:13.950> doing

00:01:14.179 --> 00:01:14.189 
because you are basically doing

00:01:14.189 --> 00:01:15.530 
because you are basically doing
everything<00:01:14.460> backwards<00:01:14.640> but<00:01:15.150> just<00:01:15.330> the<00:01:15.390> same

00:01:15.530 --> 00:01:15.540 
everything backwards but just the same

00:01:15.540 --> 00:01:16.999 
everything backwards but just the same
thing<00:01:15.689> as<00:01:15.780> me<00:01:15.900> and<00:01:16.200> you<00:01:16.530> know<00:01:16.619> but<00:01:16.830> sometimes

00:01:16.999 --> 00:01:17.009 
thing as me and you know but sometimes

00:01:17.009 --> 00:01:18.530 
thing as me and you know but sometimes
you<00:01:17.340> know<00:01:17.430> things<00:01:17.610> look<00:01:17.850> better<00:01:17.970> and<00:01:18.270> goofy

00:01:18.530 --> 00:01:18.540 
you know things look better and goofy

00:01:18.540 --> 00:01:20.270 
you know things look better and goofy
than<00:01:18.689> regular<00:01:18.930> and<00:01:19.170> sometimes<00:01:19.439> things<00:01:19.680> look

00:01:20.270 --> 00:01:20.280 
than regular and sometimes things look

00:01:20.280 --> 00:01:22.219 
than regular and sometimes things look
better<00:01:20.400> and<00:01:20.640> regularly<00:01:20.939> goofy<00:01:21.240> so<00:01:21.390> um<00:01:21.659> you

00:01:22.219 --> 00:01:22.229 
better and regularly goofy so um you

00:01:22.229 --> 00:01:23.300 
better and regularly goofy so um you
just<00:01:22.409> want<00:01:22.530> to<00:01:22.590> like<00:01:22.680> look<00:01:22.860> at<00:01:22.950> some<00:01:23.100> trig

00:01:23.300 --> 00:01:23.310 
just want to like look at some trig

00:01:23.310 --> 00:01:24.649 
just want to like look at some trig
lines<00:01:23.460> episodes<00:01:23.820> and<00:01:23.909> sofa<00:01:24.090> Caroline<00:01:24.390> trip<00:01:24.540> on

videos in general and you know just look
at<00:01:26.310> like<00:01:26.460> the<00:01:26.580> difference<00:01:26.880> I'll<00:01:27.000> just

00:01:27.260 --> 00:01:27.270 
at like the difference I'll just

regarding you'll see like you know how

00:01:28.409 --> 00:01:29.660 
regarding you'll see like you know how
you<00:01:28.470> should<00:01:28.710> trickle<00:01:28.860> and<00:01:29.070> a<00:01:29.100> goofy<00:01:29.280> or

00:01:29.660 --> 00:01:29.670 
you should trickle and a goofy or

00:01:29.670 --> 00:01:30.859 
you should trickle and a goofy or
regular<00:01:29.700> if<00:01:30.150> you're<00:01:30.270> really<00:01:30.360> not<00:01:30.540> sure<00:01:30.720> what

00:01:55.249 --> 00:01:55.259 
gonna have like enough speed basically

00:01:55.259 --> 00:01:56.359 
gonna have like enough speed basically
you<00:01:55.320> know<00:01:55.380> like<00:01:55.530> just<00:01:55.619> like<00:01:55.740> the<00:01:55.890> perfect<00:01:56.130> you

00:01:56.359 --> 00:01:56.369 
you know like just like the perfect you

00:01:56.369 --> 00:01:57.530 
you know like just like the perfect you
like<00:01:56.490> if<00:01:56.610> you<00:01:56.729> think<00:01:56.909> it's<00:01:57.030> a<00:01:57.090> good<00:01:57.180> much<00:01:57.390> me
