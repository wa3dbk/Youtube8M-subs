00:00:00.140 --> 00:00:03.380
 and we said goodbye to June but I did not 

00:00:01.910 --> 00:00:05.419
 dismissal of you because I will continue 

00:00:03.380 --> 00:00:07.669
 uploading videos but as you can see in 

00:00:05.419 --> 00:00:09.680
 this last week before uploading this 

00:00:07.669 --> 00:00:12.080
 video I let two days pass instead of 

00:00:09.680 --> 00:00:13.700
 just one before uploading videos and that's 

00:00:12.080 --> 00:00:15.350
 because I wanted to finish the month 

00:00:13.700 --> 00:00:17.539
 together we started it together we're going to 

00:00:15.350 --> 00:00:19.310
 finish it together and it made me a good 

00:00:17.539 --> 00:00:21.199
 idea to ask them esmuc force and twitter that 

00:00:19.310 --> 00:00:23.419
 they asked me questions so I could 

00:00:21.199 --> 00:00:25.550
 interact more with you talk more 

00:00:23.419 --> 00:00:27.050
 and I will use some of the questions in another 

00:00:25.550 --> 00:00:28.820
 Video of questions and answers because 

00:00:27.050 --> 00:00:31.039
 if there were several and I do not want them 

00:00:28.820 --> 00:00:32.809
 bore here 20 minutes or half an hour or 

00:00:31.039 --> 00:00:34.489
 one hour I'll start with the tea 

00:00:32.809 --> 00:00:36.500
 twitter because there are less and girls of 

00:00:34.489 --> 00:00:38.510
 twitter that's happening because there's almost 

00:00:36.500 --> 00:00:39.890
 an interaction speak to me I love 

00:00:38.510 --> 00:00:42.530
 talk with you who follow us 

00:00:39.890 --> 00:00:44.149
 on twitter they know it so we're going to 

00:00:42.530 --> 00:00:46.160
 start with twitter the first question 

00:00:44.149 --> 00:00:47.570
 of wine of elena two virgin here in 

00:00:46.160 --> 00:00:49.309
 youtube that told me if all your 

00:00:47.570 --> 00:00:51.829
 makeup disappeared but the genius of 

00:00:49.309 --> 00:00:54.800
 the lamp will return you only one which 

00:00:51.829 --> 00:00:57.230
 you would ask for concealer of my dark circles my sister 

00:00:54.800 --> 00:00:58.670
 correction of dark circles and second is of anna 

00:00:57.230 --> 00:01:00.859
 recent that also has a channel in 

00:00:58.670 --> 00:01:02.899
 YouTube visit them if they have not done so and 

00:01:00.859 --> 00:01:04.369
 is what is the most difficult for you to work 

00:01:02.899 --> 00:01:05.800
 start making videos so that more 

00:01:04.369 --> 00:01:07.930
 people saw you when 

00:01:05.800 --> 00:01:10.000
 and making videos was doing them like 

00:01:07.930 --> 00:01:12.190
 a form of distraction so 

00:01:10.000 --> 00:01:13.960
 I really did not do anything specific to 

00:01:12.190 --> 00:01:15.790
 that more people saw me simply what 

00:01:13.960 --> 00:01:17.920
 I enjoyed and I think when I 

00:01:15.790 --> 00:01:20.170
 you enjoy more people enjoy it and that 

00:01:17.920 --> 00:01:22.450
 makes you get to see more malaga 

00:01:20.170 --> 00:01:24.040
 they are asking me what is the product of 

00:01:22.450 --> 00:01:26.500
 beauty that is worth investing 

00:01:24.040 --> 00:01:28.600
 a little more money what you put in your 

00:01:26.500 --> 00:01:30.370
 face definitely but if only 

00:01:28.600 --> 00:01:32.800
 had to be one would say protective 

00:01:30.370 --> 00:01:35.140
 solar and also a good cream for the 

00:01:32.800 --> 00:01:37.660
 eyes like pylon does not queen paola me 

00:01:35.140 --> 00:01:39.790
 wonder choose one only the tumor pathway 

00:01:37.660 --> 00:01:41.500
 Mascara eyeliner shadows I love you so much 

00:01:39.790 --> 00:01:43.390
 thanks I love you too 

00:01:41.500 --> 00:01:45.370
 I love you all very much and if only 

00:01:43.390 --> 00:01:47.140
 I had to choose one of those I would choose 

00:01:45.370 --> 00:01:48.610
 eyeliner definitely because 

00:01:47.140 --> 00:01:51.280
 I could also use it as mascara 

00:01:48.610 --> 00:01:53.230
 then it's like two in one not 

00:01:51.280 --> 00:01:54.850
 in fact the first one because I could use it 

00:01:53.230 --> 00:01:57.070
 also as eyeliner and those two in 

00:01:54.850 --> 00:01:59.320
 one where my brain is and more 

00:01:57.070 --> 00:02:01.510
 ask what is it that you least and least 

00:01:59.320 --> 00:02:03.790
 like makeup a beautiful kiss 

00:02:01.510 --> 00:02:05.410
 and a kiss back for you and what 

00:02:03.790 --> 00:02:07.990
 least I like it and I think many leave 

00:02:05.410 --> 00:02:09.880
 to identify is to remove makeup what 

00:02:07.990 --> 00:02:10.960
 this gives me a lot of laziness but it has you 

00:02:09.880 --> 00:02:13.330
 what to do 

00:02:10.960 --> 00:02:15.430
 What I like the most is like when 

00:02:13.330 --> 00:02:17.530
 When I'm sick if I put on a 

00:02:15.430 --> 00:02:19.270
 little bit I feel immediately better as 

00:02:17.530 --> 00:02:21.220
 to lift your spirits by looking at me 

00:02:19.270 --> 00:02:23.290
 ask why did you stop drinking milk 

00:02:21.220 --> 00:02:25.000
 of cow what was the marketing caused to 

00:02:23.290 --> 00:02:27.910
 remove it from your diet improves your 

00:02:25.000 --> 00:02:29.890
 skin if I improve my skin and I stopped 

00:02:27.910 --> 00:02:31.900
 take because as you know and I told them in 

00:02:29.890 --> 00:02:34.180
 some video I have ovarian syndrome 

00:02:31.900 --> 00:02:36.640
 polycystic then I was reading 

00:02:34.180 --> 00:02:39.130
 many studies and I said I 'm going to try 

00:02:36.640 --> 00:02:41.800
 one month I will see how I feel I tried it 

00:02:39.130 --> 00:02:43.900
 a month and I do not regret the valentina 

00:02:41.800 --> 00:02:46.270
 he asks me a lipstick that lasts hours 

00:02:43.900 --> 00:02:48.700
 hold kisses and do not dry lips 

00:02:46.270 --> 00:02:50.560
 please let thein revlon those 

00:02:48.700 --> 00:02:52.120
 They last for hours and I have a review in my 

00:02:50.560 --> 00:02:53.980
 blog well if you have not seen them have 

00:02:52.120 --> 00:02:56.410
 enough colors and my favorite is the 

00:02:53.980 --> 00:02:58.660
 color with renzo asks me how to know 

00:02:56.410 --> 00:03:00.520
 If your skin is quality or cold tone of 

00:02:58.660 --> 00:03:02.860
 simple way simply check your 

00:03:00.520 --> 00:03:04.750
 veins if you see in greenish medium the most 

00:03:02.860 --> 00:03:06.340
 probable is that its tones so warm and 

00:03:04.750 --> 00:03:08.320
 if they look blue it's likely that 

00:03:06.340 --> 00:03:10.660
 your tones cooled I wonder 

00:03:08.320 --> 00:03:11.470
 how do you brush your face with wax or 

00:03:10.660 --> 00:03:12.910
 creams 

00:03:11.470 --> 00:03:14.620
 now let's go to facebook questions 

00:03:12.910 --> 00:03:15.010
 and as I told you, they did so many 

00:03:14.620 --> 00:03:16.900
 I am 

00:03:15.010 --> 00:03:19.720
 and what about interacting with me so much 

00:03:16.900 --> 00:03:21.700
 but I do not want to open them with a super 

00:03:19.720 --> 00:03:23.799
 giant video so I'm going to do in 

00:03:21.700 --> 00:03:26.110
 part of the first questions is 

00:03:23.799 --> 00:03:27.790
 karla ivonne and says hello I would like 

00:03:26.110 --> 00:03:29.769
 know where you get the recipes from 

00:03:27.790 --> 00:03:31.750
 delicious juices that you make I would love 

00:03:29.769 --> 00:03:33.610
 can do many like that and really not the 

00:03:31.750 --> 00:03:36.280
 sack from nowhere carla simply 

00:03:33.610 --> 00:03:38.319
 I investigate ok I want to feel better in 

00:03:36.280 --> 00:03:40.030
 about this and I start to investigate what 

00:03:38.319 --> 00:03:42.129
 fruits are good that vegetables are 

00:03:40.030 --> 00:03:43.810
 good and acid how do I do not take it out 

00:03:42.129 --> 00:03:45.970
 from nowhere and of course I try to 

00:03:43.810 --> 00:03:47.109
 see that it tastes good and that it tastes good to me 

00:03:45.970 --> 00:03:49.239
 I've had some combos that 

00:03:47.109 --> 00:03:50.650
 they definitely do not know well and do not know 

00:03:49.239 --> 00:03:52.450
 worry because those are not going 

00:03:50.650 --> 00:03:55.329
 opening the channel but what comments to 

00:03:52.450 --> 00:03:57.250
 I would love your channel by email I do not know 

00:03:55.329 --> 00:03:59.590
 how but I would love but who 

00:03:57.250 --> 00:04:01.599
 they would really see it I feel that nobody 

00:03:59.590 --> 00:04:03.280
 I would see honestly but if they would go back 

00:04:01.599 --> 00:04:04.599
 I'd love to do it, I just have to 

00:04:03.280 --> 00:04:07.030
 investigate how it is done 

00:04:04.599 --> 00:04:08.829
 jornet lopez tells me I would like to know 

00:04:07.030 --> 00:04:10.900
 how is your facial care or does your 

00:04:08.829 --> 00:04:13.359
 routine day and night and had it 

00:04:10.900 --> 00:04:15.730
 thought to do this month the truth is 

00:04:13.359 --> 00:04:17.380
 that has been changing so much 

00:04:15.730 --> 00:04:19.060
 or I can not share my routine 

00:04:17.380 --> 00:04:21.190
 because as I told you I wanted to do it 

00:04:19.060 --> 00:04:23.680
 this month but it started to change so much that 

00:04:21.190 --> 00:04:25.690
 right now I do not have routine but as soon as 

00:04:23.680 --> 00:04:27.639
 call stabilize I'll share 

00:04:25.690 --> 00:04:29.860
 already if you want the little Baptist 

00:04:27.639 --> 00:04:31.570
 year says hello I would like to know what 

00:04:29.860 --> 00:04:33.729
 eyelash mask is your favorite 

00:04:31.570 --> 00:04:35.229
 greetings come cando in the videos to me 

00:04:33.729 --> 00:04:36.910
 love that they comment and I love 

00:04:35.229 --> 00:04:39.190
 practice with you and my favorite is 

00:04:36.910 --> 00:04:40.600
 the maybelline colossal a yellow to 

00:04:39.190 --> 00:04:42.370
 water proof this is what I am 

00:04:40.600 --> 00:04:45.250
 using right now and the one that I've been 

00:04:42.370 --> 00:04:47.740
 using great and comment for effective payment 

00:04:45.250 --> 00:04:49.750
 for black points for points 

00:04:47.740 --> 00:04:52.600
 The only thing that works is to extract them 

00:04:49.750 --> 00:04:54.430
 those bandit if everything really does not work 

00:04:52.600 --> 00:04:55.990
 not me I never have served sold 

00:04:54.430 --> 00:04:57.370
 some tools to extract the 

00:04:55.990 --> 00:05:00.130
 that you can find in sally beauty 

00:04:57.370 --> 00:05:01.570
 supply and some supermarkets but not 

00:05:00.130 --> 00:05:03.580
 I would recommend that you do it by yourself 

00:05:01.570 --> 00:05:05.560
 because you can hurt your skin and 

00:05:03.580 --> 00:05:07.300
 then you will have brands that will 

00:05:05.560 --> 00:05:09.370
 be worse than in the black spots you 

00:05:07.300 --> 00:05:10.870
 I can recommend that you go to a spa or a 

00:05:09.370 --> 00:05:13.419
 Dermatologist where you can take them 

00:05:10.870 --> 00:05:14.830
 well and safely the and on chain 

00:05:13.419 --> 00:05:16.389
 says all about caring for your 

00:05:14.830 --> 00:05:18.160
 pets hygiene food toys 

00:05:16.389 --> 00:05:20.050
 training thanks 

00:05:18.160 --> 00:05:21.640
 what that would have to be a video 

00:05:20.050 --> 00:05:23.080
 apart but let me know if you 

00:05:21.640 --> 00:05:24.580
 I would like it because if I'm not going to stop it 

00:05:23.080 --> 00:05:26.560
 my blog channel is a topic 

00:05:24.580 --> 00:05:27.970
 funny to dance endangered comments which 

00:05:26.560 --> 00:05:29.590
 It's your daily routine since you 

00:05:27.970 --> 00:05:31.180
 wake up as you wash your face and what 

00:05:29.590 --> 00:05:32.980
 products you use what cosmetics 

00:05:31.180 --> 00:05:35.410
 you use for the day to day breakfast 

00:05:32.980 --> 00:05:36.550
 I think that would also have to be a 

00:05:35.410 --> 00:05:38.530
 video of my morning routine 

00:05:36.550 --> 00:05:40.630
 let's see if they'd sound like 

00:05:38.530 --> 00:05:42.640
 something very funny there of the carrion says 

00:05:40.630 --> 00:05:45.010
 tips more perfect phrases greetings leila 

00:05:42.640 --> 00:05:47.290

 there whenever I know tamaulipas there 

00:05:47.290 --> 00:05:51.280
 I have done it yet and in fact from 

00:05:48.880 --> 00:05:52.900
 have a video something about how is my 

00:05:51.280 --> 00:05:54.310
 eyebrow routine has changed a 

00:05:52.900 --> 00:05:56.020
 little and probably them 

00:05:54.310 --> 00:05:57.970
 update the routine but it's basically 

00:05:56.020 --> 00:05:59.830
 the same Maria Gomes asks that 

00:05:57.970 --> 00:06:01.510
 take advantage of your sigma maki recommendations 

00:05:59.830 --> 00:06:03.700

00:06:01.510 --> 00:06:05.410

00:06:03.700 --> 00:06:07.240

00:06:05.410 --> 00:06:08.950
 call my favorite brushes last 

00:06:07.240 --> 00:06:11.140
 facebook question for this video as 

00:06:08.950 --> 00:06:12.820
 I told them do not worry I will answer 

00:06:11.140 --> 00:06:14.860
 the questions he simply asks in 

00:06:12.820 --> 00:06:16.390
 another video mariana heron says what is the 

00:06:14.860 --> 00:06:18.010
 moisturizer that you most recommend 

00:06:16.390 --> 00:06:20.560
 as well as the good brand and the 

00:06:18.010 --> 00:06:22.480
 pharmacies or cheaper so to speak 

00:06:20.560 --> 00:06:24.639
 is the one I liked the most but I think 

00:06:22.480 --> 00:06:26.620
 discontinued is one of garnier that is 

00:06:24.639 --> 00:06:28.480
 a grape gel some version now that 

00:06:26.620 --> 00:06:30.910
 it's the cream but I liked the one 

00:06:28.480 --> 00:06:32.380
 It was the gel of grapes and I do not know if 

00:06:30.910 --> 00:06:33.820
 discontinued not only am I not what 

00:06:32.380 --> 00:06:35.530
 encounter and in terms of products of 

00:06:33.820 --> 00:06:37.450
 inversion the clinique moisturizing gel 

00:06:35.530 --> 00:06:40.000
 It is an excellent option but right now 

00:06:37.450 --> 00:06:42.220
 I'm like more using oil for
