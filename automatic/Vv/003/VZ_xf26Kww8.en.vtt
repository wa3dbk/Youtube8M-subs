00:00:01.100 --> 00:00:05.160
 hello to all so I'm doing this 

00:00:03.629 --> 00:00:08.700
 little video to explain how 

00:00:05.160 --> 00:00:12.389
 make better screenshots on the lg 

00:00:08.700 --> 00:00:15.570
 she this way there so I looked 

00:00:12.389 --> 00:00:17.369
 on a lot of forums and sites see 

00:00:15.570 --> 00:00:19.890
 how to make a screenshot and I 

00:00:17.369 --> 00:00:21.750
 did not find no one to explain 

00:00:19.890 --> 00:00:25.260
 really how to do the catch 

00:00:21.750 --> 00:00:27.630
 screen a lot of friends to me it's 

00:00:25.260 --> 00:00:31.800
 portable do not know how to do 

00:00:27.630 --> 00:00:34.530
 the screenshot so after having 

00:00:31.800 --> 00:00:38.399
 tried a little bit on especially every 

00:00:34.530 --> 00:00:40.680
 buttons unlock it and the bus 

00:00:38.399 --> 00:00:43.980
 is there to try to capture 

00:00:40.680 --> 00:00:47.309
 it does not work kampala health 

00:00:43.980 --> 00:00:50.399
 a laptop so I have a little bit 

00:00:47.309 --> 00:00:53.879
 clocked you can touch the laptop 

00:00:50.399 --> 00:00:56.280
 from little everywhere and I saw I found 

00:00:53.879 --> 00:00:59.219
 how to do the screenshot is 

00:00:56.280 --> 00:01:02.750
 very simple then there is the most and the 

00:00:59.219 --> 00:01:06.570
 less to increase the volume 

00:01:02.750 --> 00:01:11.280
 here you press the plus and the 

00:01:06.570 --> 00:01:14.509
 the same time it takes very synchro 

00:01:11.280 --> 00:01:18.030
 to be and you stay seconded 

00:01:14.509 --> 00:01:20.970
 this is a little message to talk and bones 

00:01:18.030 --> 00:01:23.880
 it appears even though these the omj of 

00:01:20.970 --> 00:01:26.909
 eraser so here is the screenshot is 

00:01:23.880 --> 00:01:29.310
 done there at the top right for 

00:01:26.909 --> 00:01:29.880
 save it but there are some very things 

00:01:29.310 --> 00:01:33.780
 convenient 

00:01:29.880 --> 00:01:36.329
 then there are six lots you can write 

00:01:33.780 --> 00:01:38.509
 on the page so more pens or 

00:01:36.329 --> 00:01:45.119
 less different 

00:01:38.509 --> 00:01:47.729
 the silo of the colors for the tastes and 

00:01:45.119 --> 00:01:48.119
 you can write about catching 

00:01:47.729 --> 00:01:52.380
 screen 

00:01:48.119 --> 00:01:56.390
 so that's very convenient so you 

00:01:52.380 --> 00:02:01.490
 can as is also here 

00:01:56.390 --> 00:02:06.020
 So I record straight and 

00:02:01.490 --> 00:02:07.000
 screenshot the screenshot 

00:02:06.020 --> 00:02:13.010
 appears here 

00:02:07.000 --> 00:02:18.250
 so here is very convenient we can write 

00:02:13.010 --> 00:02:21.680
 if the fronts here after I came back 

00:02:18.250 --> 00:02:23.000
 after that there is something also so 

00:02:21.680 --> 00:02:25.870
 a little simpler to do it 

00:02:23.000 --> 00:02:30.920
 you're going down the page from the 

00:02:25.870 --> 00:02:34.250
 russian in me I put wifi gps 

00:02:30.920 --> 00:02:37.459
 buzzer blue tooth and whose rotations 

00:02:34.250 --> 00:02:39.530
 you shift or stagger each one down there 

00:02:37.459 --> 00:02:43.489
 you click on edit 

00:02:39.530 --> 00:02:45.170
 so there is all things 

00:02:43.489 --> 00:02:52.209
 that we can put the bars of the shares and 

00:02:45.170 --> 00:02:55.340
 fast all the way down there is quick memo 

00:02:52.209 --> 00:02:56.750
 you click on cocumont it's called 

00:02:55.340 --> 00:02:57.230
 like that because I have fears about this 

00:02:56.750 --> 00:03:00.019
 portable 

00:02:57.230 --> 00:03:04.690
 Clement so after you go you 

00:03:00.019 --> 00:03:08.690
 go back down there go down there 

00:03:04.690 --> 00:03:10.390
 and there is that my words click you 

00:03:08.690 --> 00:03:14.000
 above 

00:03:10.390 --> 00:03:19.519
 so here it is like the plus and the the least 

00:03:14.000 --> 00:03:26.200
 go there baran at so always always 

00:03:19.519 --> 00:03:30.709
 to color to erase it can also 

00:03:26.200 --> 00:03:34.549
 that have a blank page to draw 

00:03:30.709 --> 00:03:37.850
 on the wants us when we click on 

00:03:34.549 --> 00:03:40.100
 there is something very practical on 

00:03:37.850 --> 00:03:42.440
 can also with small triangles 

00:03:40.100 --> 00:03:50.780
 are on the side in every corner of the 

00:03:42.440 --> 00:03:52.459
 portable crop a square but if we 

00:03:50.780 --> 00:03:56.630
 wants to have something specific here 

00:03:52.459 --> 00:04:00.519
 I'm going to take this here is a small 

00:03:56.630 --> 00:04:00.519
 saved arrow 

00:04:01.550 --> 00:04:10.850
 so the screenshot will register 

00:04:04.100 --> 00:04:15.350
 in the gallery is then so here it is 

00:04:10.850 --> 00:04:19.540
 the the screenshot with the crop 

00:04:15.350 --> 00:04:24.710
 it's done here are its beautiful qualities or 

00:04:19.540 --> 00:04:29.450
 So here I looked a little bit 

00:04:24.710 --> 00:04:31.040
 sure but sir lg.fr the site 

00:04:29.450 --> 00:04:34.070
 official so they do not say how 

00:04:31.040 --> 00:04:35.690
 do the screenshots so I have 

00:04:34.070 --> 00:04:37.190
 wanted to share what you this little 

00:04:35.690 --> 00:04:39.080
 trick to make you see how 

00:04:37.190 --> 00:04:41.930
 to do that it is true that sometimes we have 

00:04:39.080 --> 00:04:44.300
 need these screen shots a little bit of 

00:04:41.930 --> 00:04:48.440
 people know how to do it on this 

00:04:44.300 --> 00:04:52.270
 wearable that's gonna hop us for a 

00:04:48.440 --> 00:04:52.270
 small town north of the king
