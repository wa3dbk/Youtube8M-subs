to do a little buddy video clip on the
other<00:00:12.210> side<00:00:12.750> of<00:00:12.780> co-operators<00:00:13.349> it<00:00:14.309> seems<00:00:14.639> like

00:00:14.900 --> 00:00:14.910 
other side of co-operators it seems like

00:00:14.910 --> 00:00:17.349 
other side of co-operators it seems like
a<00:00:14.940> lot<00:00:15.179> of<00:00:15.210> people<00:00:15.420> aren't<00:00:15.839> really<00:00:15.900> sure

00:00:17.349 --> 00:00:17.359 
a lot of people aren't really sure

what's happening how these cogs really

00:00:19.830 --> 00:00:22.279 
what's happening how these cogs really
function<00:00:20.369> what<00:00:21.119> are<00:00:21.270> the<00:00:21.359> differences<00:00:21.930> and<00:00:22.140> so

00:00:22.279 --> 00:00:22.289 
function what are the differences and so

00:00:22.289 --> 00:00:27.009 
function what are the differences and so
on<00:00:23.150> what<00:00:24.150> I'm<00:00:24.240> gonna<00:00:24.390> do<00:00:24.630> now<00:00:24.810> is<00:00:25.109> this<00:00:25.439> is<00:00:25.650> a

when<00:00:31.560> looking<00:00:31.800> at<00:00:31.949> the<00:00:32.040> co-operators<00:00:32.570> okay

00:00:33.560 --> 00:00:33.570 
when looking at the co-operators okay

00:00:33.570 --> 00:00:38.450 
when looking at the co-operators okay
this<00:00:33.750> is<00:00:33.899> a<00:00:33.930> set<00:00:34.230> of<00:00:35.510> 40<00:00:36.510> ELLs<00:00:36.719> and<00:00:37.280> I've<00:00:38.280> got

issues the resist a school if you look
at<00:02:35.000> these<00:02:35.120> carburetors<00:02:35.480> you'll<00:02:35.840> see<00:02:36.110> that<00:02:36.320> the

00:02:36.460 --> 00:02:36.470 
at these carburetors you'll see that the

00:02:36.470 --> 00:02:41.290 
at these carburetors you'll see that the
edge<00:02:36.650> screws<00:02:36.950> are<00:02:38.440> recessed<00:02:39.440> inside<00:02:40.300> inside

this<00:02:54.680> one<00:02:54.890> has<00:02:54.980> got<00:02:55.040> a<00:02:55.160> set<00:02:55.340> of<00:02:55.460> ten<00:02:55.670> pots<00:02:55.850> on

00:02:56.050 --> 00:02:56.060 
this one has got a set of ten pots on

00:02:56.060 --> 00:02:58.930 
this one has got a set of ten pots on
basically<00:02:56.720> sell<00:02:57.220> six<00:02:58.220> this<00:02:58.370> one<00:02:58.520> is<00:02:58.610> a<00:02:58.670> short

00:02:58.930 --> 00:02:58.940 
basically sell six this one is a short

00:02:58.940 --> 00:03:00.520 
basically sell six this one is a short
set<00:02:59.120> of<00:02:59.240> trumpets<00:02:59.660> to<00:02:59.750> give<00:02:59.900> you<00:02:59.960> a<00:02:59.990> bit<00:03:00.170> more<00:03:00.200> a

00:03:00.520 --> 00:03:00.530 
set of trumpets to give you a bit more a

00:03:00.530 --> 00:03:06.550 
set of trumpets to give you a bit more a
speed<00:03:03.310> okay<00:03:04.310> so<00:03:05.060> basically<00:03:05.380> if<00:03:06.380> you're

00:03:06.550 --> 00:03:06.560 
speed okay so basically if you're

00:03:06.560 --> 00:03:11.740 
speed okay so basically if you're
running<00:03:06.740> them<00:03:07.840> dual<00:03:08.840> system<00:03:10.750> you're

00:03:11.740 --> 00:03:11.750 
running them dual system you're

00:03:11.750 --> 00:03:15.540 
running them dual system you're
balancing<00:03:12.350> this<00:03:12.620> is<00:03:12.800> your<00:03:12.950> balancer<00:03:13.550> on<00:03:14.350> this

00:03:15.540 --> 00:03:15.550 
balancing this is your balancer on this

00:03:15.550 --> 00:03:19.260 
balancing this is your balancer on this
adjustment<00:03:16.550> here<00:03:17.020> is<00:03:18.020> we<00:03:18.230> adjust<00:03:18.710> the

00:03:19.260 --> 00:03:19.270 
adjustment here is we adjust the

00:03:19.270 --> 00:03:21.580 
adjustment here is we adjust the
balancing<00:03:20.270> between<00:03:20.420> the<00:03:20.870> two<00:03:21.020> carbons<00:03:21.440> you

00:03:21.580 --> 00:03:21.590 
balancing between the two carbons you

00:03:21.590 --> 00:03:23.860 
balancing between the two carbons you
gotta<00:03:21.890> get<00:03:22.010> him<00:03:22.160> exactly<00:03:22.690> balanced<00:03:23.690> with

00:03:23.860 --> 00:03:23.870 
gotta get him exactly balanced with

gotta get him exactly balanced with
regards<00:03:24.410> to<00:03:25.420> open<00:03:26.420> the<00:03:26.510> butterfly<00:03:26.930> as<00:03:26.990> a<00:03:27.080> city

00:03:29.040 --> 00:03:29.050 
regards to open the butterfly as a city

00:03:29.050 --> 00:03:32.690 
regards to open the butterfly as a city
okay

00:03:32.690 --> 00:03:32.700 

00:03:32.700 --> 00:03:35.120 

and<00:03:33.000> that<00:03:33.480> basically<00:03:33.660> concludes<00:03:34.110> the<00:03:34.920> first

00:03:35.120 --> 00:03:35.130 
and that basically concludes the first

00:03:35.130 --> 00:03:37.900 
and that basically concludes the first
part<00:03:35.660> in<00:03:36.660> the<00:03:36.780> second<00:03:37.080> part<00:03:37.260> I<00:03:37.440> will<00:03:37.560> be

00:03:37.900 --> 00:03:37.910 
part in the second part I will be

00:03:37.910 --> 00:03:40.040 
part in the second part I will be
dissecting<00:03:38.910> these<00:03:39.120> carburetors<00:03:39.450> and<00:03:39.690> showing

00:03:40.040 --> 00:03:40.050 
dissecting these carburetors and showing

00:03:40.050 --> 00:03:41.750 
dissecting these carburetors and showing
you<00:03:40.200> what<00:03:40.230> it<00:03:40.470> looks<00:03:40.620> like<00:03:40.739> on<00:03:40.920> the<00:03:41.010> inside

00:03:41.750 --> 00:03:41.760 
you what it looks like on the inside

00:03:41.760 --> 00:03:44.479 
you what it looks like on the inside
watch<00:03:42.390> eat<00:03:42.690> what<00:03:43.020> each<00:03:43.290> and<00:03:43.560> every<00:03:44.040> passage

00:03:44.479 --> 00:03:44.489 
watch eat what each and every passage

00:03:44.489 --> 00:03:49.490 
watch eat what each and every passage
does<00:03:44.849> and<00:03:45.290> how<00:03:46.290> it<00:03:46.590> actually<00:03:46.800> functions<00:03:48.500> thank

00:03:49.490 --> 00:03:49.500 
does and how it actually functions thank

00:03:49.500 --> 00:03:51.709 
does and how it actually functions thank
