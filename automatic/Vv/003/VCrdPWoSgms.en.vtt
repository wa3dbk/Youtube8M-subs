let's get started

00:00:21.930 --> 00:00:24.230 
let's get started
it<00:00:21.990> does<00:00:22.470> do<00:00:22.769> lots<00:00:23.070> of<00:00:23.220> different<00:00:23.340> modulations

00:00:24.230 --> 00:00:24.240 
it does do lots of different modulations

00:00:24.240 --> 00:00:26.660 
it does do lots of different modulations
and<00:00:24.480> we'll<00:00:24.570> explain<00:00:24.900> that<00:00:24.960> as<00:00:25.260> we<00:00:25.439> go<00:00:25.680> but<00:00:26.550> it

00:00:26.660 --> 00:00:26.670 
and we'll explain that as we go but it

00:00:26.670 --> 00:00:28.640 
and we'll explain that as we go but it
does<00:00:26.849> start<00:00:27.090> off<00:00:27.269> in<00:00:27.449> the<00:00:27.510> key<00:00:27.689> of<00:00:27.810> F<00:00:28.050> so<00:00:28.380> let's

00:00:28.640 --> 00:00:28.650 
does start off in the key of F so let's

00:00:28.650 --> 00:00:31.310 
does start off in the key of F so let's
just<00:00:28.859> explain<00:00:29.189> what<00:00:29.369> that<00:00:29.400> is<00:00:29.550> first<00:00:30.029> key<00:00:31.019> of<00:00:31.140> F

00:00:31.310 --> 00:00:31.320 
just explain what that is first key of F

00:00:31.320 --> 00:00:44.150 
just explain what that is first key of F
is<00:00:31.500> this<00:00:31.740> F<00:00:32.520> G<00:00:33.239> a<00:00:33.600> B<00:00:34.440> flat<00:00:34.559> C<00:00:34.860> D<00:00:35.870> F<00:00:41.719> ok<00:00:42.719> so<00:00:43.260> the

00:00:44.150 --> 00:00:44.160 
is this F G a B flat C D F ok so the

00:00:44.160 --> 00:00:45.740 
is this F G a B flat C D F ok so the
first<00:00:44.309> thing<00:00:44.520> let's<00:00:44.670> just<00:00:44.820> do<00:00:44.969> the<00:00:45.120> melody<00:00:45.539> of

00:00:45.740 --> 00:00:45.750 
first thing let's just do the melody of

through like the first time instantly
recognizable<00:00:50.160> so<00:00:50.370> what<00:00:51.149> we<00:00:51.270> too<00:00:51.570> much<00:00:51.719> need<00:00:51.989> to

00:00:52.100 --> 00:00:52.110 
recognizable so what we too much need to

00:00:52.110 --> 00:00:53.930 
recognizable so what we too much need to
explain<00:00:52.530> but<00:00:52.710> the<00:00:52.920> chords<00:00:53.309> are<00:00:53.430> we're<00:00:53.579> kind<00:00:53.910> of

00:00:53.930 --> 00:00:53.940 
explain but the chords are we're kind of

explain but the chords are we're kind of
cool<00:00:54.149> it<00:00:54.360> goes<00:00:54.449> pull<00:00:54.780> along<00:00:55.559> with<00:00:55.770> all<00:00:55.920> this

00:00:56.119 --> 00:00:56.129 
cool it goes pull along with all this

00:00:56.129 --> 00:00:58.369 
cool it goes pull along with all this
and<00:00:56.399> then<00:00:56.489> the<00:00:56.579> modulations<00:00:57.390> so<00:00:58.020> in<00:00:58.140> the<00:00:58.230> key

00:00:58.369 --> 00:00:58.379 
and then the modulations so in the key

00:00:58.379 --> 00:01:04.820 
and then the modulations so in the key
of<00:00:58.410> F<00:00:58.620> it<00:00:58.890> starts<00:00:59.190> off<00:00:59.340> with<00:00:59.550> this<00:01:03.500> ok<00:01:04.500> so<00:01:04.530> what

00:01:04.820 --> 00:01:04.830 
of F it starts off with this ok so what

00:01:04.830 --> 00:01:11.390 
of F it starts off with this ok so what
that<00:01:04.979> is<00:01:05.220> is<00:01:05.250> C<00:01:06.290> FC<00:01:07.290> FC<00:01:08.299> FC<00:01:09.650> ok<00:01:10.650> not<00:01:11.189> very

okay so talk about that to begin with
those<00:02:09.670> first<00:02:09.910> two<00:02:10.060> measures<00:02:10.270> it's<00:02:10.690> basically

00:02:11.040 --> 00:02:11.050 
those first two measures it's basically

00:02:11.050 --> 00:02:14.670 
those first two measures it's basically
based<00:02:11.230> off<00:02:11.470> of<00:02:11.500> F<00:02:12.540> so<00:02:13.540> my<00:02:13.870> melody<00:02:14.290> again<00:02:14.440> went

00:02:14.670 --> 00:02:14.680 
based off of F so my melody again went

00:02:14.680 --> 00:02:16.740 
based off of F so my melody again went
to<00:02:14.710> CF<00:02:15.160> so<00:02:15.550> in<00:02:15.760> my<00:02:15.880> left<00:02:16.060> hand<00:02:16.240> I'm<00:02:16.420> doing

00:02:16.740 --> 00:02:16.750 
to CF so in my left hand I'm doing

00:02:16.750 --> 00:02:21.690 
to CF so in my left hand I'm doing
basically<00:02:16.960> kind<00:02:17.530> of<00:02:19.470> doing<00:02:20.470> an<00:02:20.590> F<00:02:21.010> octaves

00:02:21.690 --> 00:02:21.700 
basically kind of doing an F octaves

00:02:21.700 --> 00:02:23.880 
basically kind of doing an F octaves
that<00:02:21.760> you<00:02:21.970> will<00:02:22.120> want<00:02:22.450> to<00:02:22.960> and<00:02:23.380> then<00:02:23.560> in<00:02:23.680> my

00:02:23.880 --> 00:02:23.890 
that you will want to and then in my

00:02:23.890 --> 00:02:26.340 
that you will want to and then in my
right<00:02:24.490> hand<00:02:24.730> I<00:02:24.970> filled<00:02:25.300> it<00:02:25.450> in<00:02:25.630> by<00:02:25.870> going<00:02:26.230> with

00:02:26.340 --> 00:02:26.350 
right hand I filled it in by going with

00:02:26.350 --> 00:02:28.160 
right hand I filled it in by going with
the<00:02:26.470> a<00:02:26.500> so<00:02:27.040> it<00:02:27.160> kind<00:02:27.370> of<00:02:27.400> gives<00:02:27.580> that<00:02:27.760> core

00:02:28.160 --> 00:02:28.170 
the a so it kind of gives that core

00:02:28.170 --> 00:02:31.800 
the a so it kind of gives that core
texture<00:02:29.170> if<00:02:29.230> you<00:02:29.320> will<00:02:30.270> so<00:02:31.270> I'm<00:02:31.390> only<00:02:31.570> going<00:02:31.750> to

00:02:31.800 --> 00:02:31.810 
texture if you will so I'm only going to

00:02:31.810 --> 00:02:33.660 
texture if you will so I'm only going to
be<00:02:31.900> kind<00:02:32.140> of<00:02:32.230> toggling<00:02:32.740> back<00:02:32.920> and<00:02:32.980> forth<00:02:33.459> with

00:02:33.660 --> 00:02:33.670 
be kind of toggling back and forth with

00:02:33.670 --> 00:02:35.520 
be kind of toggling back and forth with
my<00:02:33.820> left<00:02:34.120> hand<00:02:34.209> helping<00:02:34.870> create<00:02:35.140> different

00:02:35.520 --> 00:02:35.530 
my left hand helping create different

00:02:35.530 --> 00:02:39.590 
my left hand helping create different
chord<00:02:35.800> textures<00:02:37.590> like<00:02:38.590> what<00:02:38.740> there's<00:02:38.950> a<00:02:39.040> D

00:02:39.590 --> 00:02:39.600 
chord textures like what there's a D

00:02:39.600 --> 00:02:43.530 
chord textures like what there's a D
with<00:02:40.600> the<00:02:40.630> sea<00:02:41.230> up<00:02:41.350> here<00:02:41.560> and<00:02:42.489> then<00:02:43.150> we<00:02:43.300> got<00:02:43.450> an

00:02:43.530 --> 00:02:43.540 
with the sea up here and then we got an

00:02:43.540 --> 00:02:47.610 
with the sea up here and then we got an
A<00:02:43.750> in<00:02:43.780> a<00:02:44.170> nap

00:02:47.610 --> 00:02:47.620 

00:02:47.620 --> 00:02:52.890 

okay<00:02:48.250> this<00:02:48.400> is<00:02:48.550> a<00:02:48.580> G<00:02:51.150> so<00:02:52.150> we<00:02:52.269> got<00:02:52.390> the<00:02:52.510> gene<00:02:52.750> the

00:02:52.890 --> 00:02:52.900 
okay this is a G so we got the gene the

00:02:52.900 --> 00:02:54.780 
okay this is a G so we got the gene the
bottom<00:02:53.260> then<00:02:53.379> we're<00:02:53.500> going<00:02:53.620> to<00:02:53.650> do<00:02:53.830> it<00:02:54.040> the<00:02:54.670> up

00:02:54.780 --> 00:02:54.790 
bottom then we're going to do it the up

00:02:54.790 --> 00:02:57.980 
bottom then we're going to do it the up
here<00:02:55.090> and<00:02:55.660> then<00:02:55.780> a<00:02:55.810> half

00:02:57.980 --> 00:02:57.990 
here and then a half

00:02:57.990 --> 00:03:02.780 
here and then a half
to<00:02:58.530> a<00:02:58.590> c7<00:02:59.400> seeing<00:02:59.730> the<00:02:59.880> bass<00:03:00.060> we<00:03:00.900> G<00:03:01.710> b-flat<00:03:02.100> C

00:03:02.780 --> 00:03:02.790 
to a c7 seeing the bass we G b-flat C

00:03:02.790 --> 00:03:07.949 
to a c7 seeing the bass we G b-flat C
can<00:03:03.120> i<00:03:03.150> play<00:03:03.390> all<00:03:03.600> that<00:03:03.810> again

00:03:07.949 --> 00:03:07.959 

00:03:07.959 --> 00:03:11.010 

okay<00:03:08.680> it<00:03:08.739> does<00:03:08.890> it<00:03:09.069> again

00:03:11.010 --> 00:03:11.020 
okay it does it again

00:03:11.020 --> 00:03:13.570 
okay it does it again
same<00:03:12.020> thing<00:03:12.349> September<00:03:12.980> leaders<00:03:13.340> did

00:03:13.570 --> 00:03:13.580 
same thing September leaders did

00:03:13.580 --> 00:03:17.880 
same thing September leaders did
different<00:03:14.180> we<00:03:14.239> didn't<00:03:14.510> go<00:03:14.569> down<00:03:14.870> that<00:03:15.140> side

00:03:17.880 --> 00:03:17.890 

00:03:17.890 --> 00:03:21.309 

and<00:03:18.890> this<00:03:19.040> is<00:03:19.220> a<00:03:19.250> gene<00:03:19.810> with<00:03:20.810> the<00:03:20.930> a<00:03:20.959> and<00:03:21.260> the

00:03:21.309 --> 00:03:21.319 
and this is a gene with the a and the

00:03:21.319 --> 00:03:27.100 
and this is a gene with the a and the
tops<00:03:21.590> of<00:03:21.769> gene<00:03:22.099> D<00:03:24.519> it's<00:03:25.519> a<00:03:25.640> C<00:03:25.940> in<00:03:26.540> the<00:03:26.660> base<00:03:26.840> if

00:03:27.100 --> 00:03:27.110 
tops of gene D it's a C in the base if

00:03:27.110 --> 00:03:28.479 
tops of gene D it's a C in the base if
you<00:03:27.170> want<00:03:27.380> to<00:03:27.470> fill<00:03:27.680> it<00:03:27.800> in<00:03:27.860> with<00:03:27.920> a<00:03:28.069> gene<00:03:28.370> you

00:03:28.479 --> 00:03:28.489 
you want to fill it in with a gene you

00:03:28.489 --> 00:03:30.759 
you want to fill it in with a gene you
can't<00:03:28.760> but<00:03:29.269> this<00:03:29.390> is<00:03:29.540> very<00:03:29.720> lighting<00:03:30.230> area<00:03:30.500> so

00:03:30.759 --> 00:03:30.769 
can't but this is very lighting area so

00:03:30.769 --> 00:03:34.449 
can't but this is very lighting area so
not<00:03:31.700> a<00:03:31.760> whole<00:03:32.030> lot<00:03:32.239> of<00:03:32.739> thick<00:03:33.739> whole<00:03:34.099> core

00:03:34.449 --> 00:03:34.459 
not a whole lot of thick whole core

00:03:34.459 --> 00:03:39.370 
not a whole lot of thick whole core
textures<00:03:34.910> are<00:03:35.060> really<00:03:35.090> necessary<00:03:38.380> like

00:03:39.370 --> 00:03:39.380 
textures are really necessary like

00:03:39.380 --> 00:03:43.660 
textures are really necessary like
hearing<00:03:40.069> my<00:03:40.250> feel<00:03:42.040> okay<00:03:43.040> this<00:03:43.250> right<00:03:43.400> here<00:03:43.610> is

00:03:43.660 --> 00:03:43.670 
hearing my feel okay this right here is

00:03:43.670 --> 00:03:51.009 
hearing my feel okay this right here is
a<00:03:43.700> b-flat<00:03:44.150> black<00:03:44.959> black<00:03:45.590> and<00:03:46.340> app<00:03:49.959> okay<00:03:50.959> so

00:03:51.009 --> 00:03:51.019 
a b-flat black black and app okay so

00:03:51.019 --> 00:03:54.850 
a b-flat black black and app okay so
that<00:03:51.290> was<00:03:51.970> kind<00:03:52.970> of<00:03:53.000> like<00:03:53.090> a<00:03:53.239> ad<00:03:53.620> suspended<00:03:54.620> see

00:03:54.850 --> 00:03:54.860 
that was kind of like a ad suspended see

00:03:54.860 --> 00:04:00.870 
that was kind of like a ad suspended see
if<00:03:55.010> you<00:03:55.130> will<00:03:55.599> wear<00:03:56.599> it<00:03:56.660> see<00:03:56.989> gene<00:03:57.680> seen<00:03:58.360> today

00:04:00.870 --> 00:04:00.880 
if you will wear it see gene seen today

00:04:00.880 --> 00:04:05.800 
if you will wear it see gene seen today
into<00:04:01.880> a<00:04:01.910> full-fledged<00:04:02.180> app<00:04:02.950> max<00:04:04.540> see<00:04:05.540> and<00:04:05.780> a

00:04:05.800 --> 00:04:05.810 
into a full-fledged app max see and a

00:04:05.810 --> 00:04:08.710 
into a full-fledged app max see and a
half<00:04:06.069> okay<00:04:07.069> so<00:04:08.030> let's<00:04:08.209> check<00:04:08.269> it<00:04:08.360> right<00:04:08.480> there

00:04:08.710 --> 00:04:08.720 
half okay so let's check it right there

00:04:08.720 --> 00:04:14.949 
half okay so let's check it right there
from<00:04:08.930> that<00:04:09.140> very<00:04:10.069> into<00:04:10.340> that<00:04:13.390> note<00:04:14.390> I'm<00:04:14.660> kind

00:04:14.949 --> 00:04:14.959 
from that very into that note I'm kind

00:04:14.959 --> 00:04:17.979 
from that very into that note I'm kind
of<00:04:15.019> staccato<00:04:15.470> with<00:04:15.859> those<00:04:16.100> notes<00:04:16.780> instead<00:04:17.780> of

00:04:17.979 --> 00:04:17.989 
of staccato with those notes instead of

00:04:17.989 --> 00:04:21.970 
of staccato with those notes instead of
playing<00:04:18.229> them

00:04:21.970 --> 00:04:21.980 

00:04:21.980 --> 00:04:27.460 

that's<00:04:22.980> fine<00:04:23.280> listicle<00:04:23.790> e<00:04:23.850> how<00:04:24.000> the<00:04:24.060> tune<00:04:24.360> goes

00:04:27.460 --> 00:04:27.470 

00:04:27.470 --> 00:04:29.810 

yeah<00:04:28.470> I'm<00:04:28.530> kind<00:04:28.800> of<00:04:28.860> detached<00:04:29.280> from<00:04:29.550> those

00:04:29.810 --> 00:04:29.820 
yeah I'm kind of detached from those

00:04:29.820 --> 00:04:32.630 
yeah I'm kind of detached from those
okay<00:04:30.600> now<00:04:30.840> the<00:04:30.900> fun<00:04:31.230> starts<00:04:31.260> we<00:04:32.190> do<00:04:32.370> it<00:04:32.490> in

00:04:32.630 --> 00:04:32.640 
okay now the fun starts we do it in

00:04:32.640 --> 00:04:35.060 
okay now the fun starts we do it in
another<00:04:32.880> key<00:04:33.210> we<00:04:33.960> started<00:04:34.350> off<00:04:34.470> a<00:04:34.500> nap<00:04:34.830> and

00:04:35.060 --> 00:04:35.070 
another key we started off a nap and

00:04:35.070 --> 00:04:36.830 
another key we started off a nap and
what's<00:04:35.340> happening<00:04:35.820> murder<00:04:36.330> it's<00:04:36.540> kind<00:04:36.780> of

00:04:36.830 --> 00:04:36.840 
what's happening murder it's kind of

00:04:36.840 --> 00:04:38.420 
what's happening murder it's kind of
very<00:04:37.080> brilliant<00:04:37.620> with<00:04:37.740> this<00:04:37.950> if<00:04:38.160> you<00:04:38.250> will

00:04:38.420 --> 00:04:38.430 
very brilliant with this if you will

00:04:38.430 --> 00:04:40.490 
very brilliant with this if you will
merciful<00:04:39.150> melody<00:04:39.540> and<00:04:39.630> what<00:04:39.750> not<00:04:39.990> but<00:04:40.230> what

00:04:40.490 --> 00:04:40.500 
merciful melody and what not but what

00:04:40.500 --> 00:04:43.250 
merciful melody and what not but what
makes<00:04:40.770> it<00:04:40.950> interesting<00:04:41.040> is<00:04:41.640> that<00:04:42.030> each<00:04:42.840> time

00:04:43.250 --> 00:04:43.260 
makes it interesting is that each time

00:04:43.260 --> 00:04:46.040 
makes it interesting is that each time
he<00:04:43.650> goes<00:04:43.860> up<00:04:44.130> what<00:04:44.400> we<00:04:44.520> call<00:04:44.700> a<00:04:44.730> minor<00:04:45.000> third<00:04:45.390> so

00:04:46.040 --> 00:04:46.050 
he goes up what we call a minor third so

00:04:46.050 --> 00:04:47.780 
he goes up what we call a minor third so
minor<00:04:46.320> third<00:04:46.680> is<00:04:46.860> basically<00:04:47.280> three<00:04:47.550> half

00:04:47.780 --> 00:04:47.790 
minor third is basically three half

00:04:47.790 --> 00:04:50.960 
minor third is basically three half
steps<00:04:48.120> so<00:04:48.360> one<00:04:48.870> two<00:04:49.260> three<00:04:49.290> go<00:04:50.190> to<00:04:50.250> the<00:04:50.460> a-flat

00:04:50.960 --> 00:04:50.970 
steps so one two three go to the a-flat

00:04:50.970 --> 00:04:52.700 
steps so one two three go to the a-flat
so<00:04:51.210> now<00:04:51.420> we're<00:04:51.690> going<00:04:51.780> to<00:04:51.840> do<00:04:51.990> the<00:04:52.170> same<00:04:52.410> thing

00:04:52.700 --> 00:04:52.710 
so now we're going to do the same thing

00:04:52.710 --> 00:04:57.650 
so now we're going to do the same thing
in<00:04:53.130> the<00:04:53.520> key<00:04:53.730> of<00:04:53.850> a-flat

00:04:57.650 --> 00:04:57.660 

00:04:57.660 --> 00:05:03.270 

okay<00:04:58.660> so<00:04:59.350> those<00:04:59.590> notes<00:04:59.890> are<00:05:00.070> a<00:05:00.250> flat<00:05:00.580> and<00:05:00.850> flat
