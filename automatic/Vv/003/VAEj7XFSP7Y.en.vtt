00:00:30.500 --> 00:00:30.510 
completely the opposite of anything that

00:00:31.970 --> 00:00:31.980 
makes any kind of sense in the entire

00:00:31.980 --> 00:00:33.530 
makes any kind of sense in the entire
world<00:00:32.250> and<00:00:32.700> you<00:00:32.820> may<00:00:32.969> be<00:00:33.030> saying<00:00:33.360> to<00:00:33.480> yourself

00:00:33.530 --> 00:00:33.540 
world and you may be saying to yourself

00:00:33.540 --> 00:00:35.660 
world and you may be saying to yourself
well<00:00:34.020> Joe<00:00:34.350> you're<00:00:34.860> being<00:00:35.040> awfully<00:00:35.340> hard<00:00:35.550> on

00:00:35.660 --> 00:00:35.670 
well Joe you're being awfully hard on

00:00:35.670 --> 00:00:37.190 
well Joe you're being awfully hard on
this<00:00:35.850> beautiful<00:00:36.120> car<00:00:36.510> and<00:00:36.750> I'm<00:00:36.840> not<00:00:36.989> actually

00:00:37.190 --> 00:00:37.200 
this beautiful car and I'm not actually

00:00:37.200 --> 00:00:39.020 
this beautiful car and I'm not actually
being<00:00:37.530> hard<00:00:37.800> at<00:00:37.890> all<00:00:37.980> just<00:00:38.250> it's<00:00:38.610> a<00:00:38.760> car<00:00:39.000> that

00:00:39.020 --> 00:00:39.030 
being hard at all just it's a car that

00:00:39.030 --> 00:00:41.209 
being hard at all just it's a car that
doesn't<00:00:39.420> make<00:00:39.719> any<00:00:39.989> sense<00:00:40.469> and<00:00:40.710> maybe<00:00:40.920> that's

00:00:41.209 --> 00:00:41.219 
doesn't make any sense and maybe that's

00:00:41.219 --> 00:00:43.790 
doesn't make any sense and maybe that's
the<00:00:41.399> purpose<00:00:41.790> of<00:00:42.000> the<00:00:42.180> x6m<00:00:42.780> a<00:00:42.989> car<00:00:43.410> that<00:00:43.620> at

00:00:43.790 --> 00:00:43.800 
the purpose of the x6m a car that at

00:00:43.800 --> 00:00:46.400 
the purpose of the x6m a car that at
almost<00:00:44.510> $100,000<00:00:45.510> is<00:00:45.780> definitely

00:00:46.400 --> 00:00:46.410 
almost $100,000 is definitely

00:00:46.410 --> 00:00:47.630 
almost $100,000 is definitely
one-of-a-kind

00:00:47.630 --> 00:00:47.640 
one-of-a-kind

00:00:47.640 --> 00:00:49.880 
one-of-a-kind
it's<00:00:48.000> it's<00:00:48.629> a<00:00:48.750> high-performance<00:00:49.379> sports<00:00:49.620> car

00:00:49.880 --> 00:00:49.890 
it's it's a high-performance sports car

00:00:49.890 --> 00:00:53.180 
it's it's a high-performance sports car
of<00:00:49.980> course<00:00:50.160> it<00:00:50.340> is<00:00:50.399> 555<00:00:51.180> horsepower<00:00:51.360> and<00:00:52.190> 501

00:00:53.180 --> 00:00:53.190 
of course it is 555 horsepower and 501

00:00:53.190 --> 00:00:55.220 
of course it is 555 horsepower and 501
pound-feet<00:00:53.969> of<00:00:54.000> torque<00:00:54.239> so<00:00:54.660> it's

00:00:55.220 --> 00:00:55.230 
pound-feet of torque so it's

00:00:55.230 --> 00:00:58.189 
pound-feet of torque so it's
unbelievably<00:00:56.070> fast<00:00:56.430> but<00:00:56.820> it<00:00:57.120> sits<00:00:57.449> high<00:00:57.719> like

00:00:58.189 --> 00:00:58.199 
unbelievably fast but it sits high like

00:00:58.199 --> 00:00:59.779 
unbelievably fast but it sits high like
a<00:00:58.230> truck<00:00:58.590> and<00:00:58.859> so<00:00:59.250> you<00:00:59.340> say<00:00:59.520> well<00:00:59.670> of<00:00:59.760> course

00:00:59.779 --> 00:00:59.789 
a truck and so you say well of course

00:00:59.789 --> 00:01:01.369 
a truck and so you say well of course
it's<00:01:00.120> it's<00:01:00.300> I<00:01:00.449> like<00:01:00.660> a<00:01:00.719> truck<00:01:01.020> it's<00:01:01.230> a

00:01:01.369 --> 00:01:01.379 
it's it's I like a truck it's a

00:01:01.379 --> 00:01:04.130 
it's it's I like a truck it's a
crossovers<00:01:02.070> for<00:01:02.280> utility<00:01:02.760> yet<00:01:03.270> it<00:01:03.480> has<00:01:03.660> almost

00:01:04.130 --> 00:01:04.140 
crossovers for utility yet it has almost

00:01:04.140 --> 00:01:06.950 
crossovers for utility yet it has almost
no<00:01:04.559> interior<00:01:05.070> room<00:01:05.580> and<00:01:05.760> only<00:01:06.119> seats<00:01:06.540> for

00:01:06.950 --> 00:01:06.960 
no interior room and only seats for

00:01:06.960 --> 00:01:09.560 
no interior room and only seats for
people<00:01:07.470> and<00:01:07.680> so<00:01:08.159> even<00:01:08.610> the<00:01:08.700> above<00:01:09.119> beyond<00:01:09.390> that

00:01:09.560 --> 00:01:09.570 
people and so even the above beyond that

00:01:09.570 --> 00:01:11.929 
people and so even the above beyond that
in<00:01:09.750> the<00:01:10.080> back<00:01:10.260> seat<00:01:10.619> where<00:01:10.950> you<00:01:11.130> have<00:01:11.310> just<00:01:11.580> two

00:01:11.929 --> 00:01:11.939 
in the back seat where you have just two

00:01:11.939 --> 00:01:14.300 
in the back seat where you have just two
people<00:01:12.240> can<00:01:12.600> sit<00:01:12.930> the<00:01:13.320> rear<00:01:13.560> seats<00:01:13.830> don't<00:01:14.010> even

00:01:14.300 --> 00:01:14.310 
people can sit the rear seats don't even

00:01:14.310 --> 00:01:16.280 
people can sit the rear seats don't even
recline<00:01:14.700> and<00:01:14.970> then<00:01:15.270> it<00:01:15.450> has<00:01:15.570> such<00:01:15.780> a<00:01:15.810> thick

00:01:16.280 --> 00:01:16.290 
recline and then it has such a thick

00:01:16.290 --> 00:01:19.100 
recline and then it has such a thick
slope<00:01:16.890> the<00:01:17.400> in<00:01:17.970> the<00:01:18.180> back<00:01:18.330> half<00:01:18.570> of<00:01:18.600> the<00:01:18.930> car

00:01:19.100 --> 00:01:19.110 
slope the in the back half of the car

00:01:19.110 --> 00:01:21.560 
slope the in the back half of the car
that<00:01:19.650> you<00:01:19.950> actually<00:01:20.159> have<00:01:20.700> not<00:01:21.090> very<00:01:21.360> much

00:01:21.560 --> 00:01:21.570 
that you actually have not very much

00:01:21.570 --> 00:01:23.570 
that you actually have not very much
space<00:01:21.840> this<00:01:22.080> is<00:01:22.259> more<00:01:22.470> like<00:01:22.619> a<00:01:22.650> compact<00:01:23.220> car

00:01:23.570 --> 00:01:23.580 
space this is more like a compact car

00:01:23.580 --> 00:01:26.620 
space this is more like a compact car
inside<00:01:24.030> not<00:01:24.630> like<00:01:24.930> a<00:01:24.960> big<00:01:25.229> sport<00:01:25.530> utility<00:01:26.040> so

00:01:26.620 --> 00:01:26.630 
inside not like a big sport utility so

00:01:26.630 --> 00:01:29.179 
inside not like a big sport utility so
you<00:01:27.630> could<00:01:27.810> look<00:01:27.900> out<00:01:28.049> and<00:01:28.200> say<00:01:28.350> well<00:01:28.530> you<00:01:29.100> know

00:01:29.179 --> 00:01:29.189 
you could look out and say well you know

00:01:29.189 --> 00:01:31.399 
you could look out and say well you know
it's<00:01:29.310> fast<00:01:29.520> and<00:01:29.939> it<00:01:30.030> is<00:01:30.390> what<00:01:30.570> it<00:01:30.689> is<00:01:30.810> but<00:01:31.110> the

00:01:31.399 --> 00:01:31.409 
it's fast and it is what it is but the

00:01:31.409 --> 00:01:32.870 
it's fast and it is what it is but the
real<00:01:31.590> trick<00:01:31.829> on<00:01:32.040> this<00:01:32.159> car<00:01:32.430> is<00:01:32.579> that<00:01:32.759> it

00:01:32.870 --> 00:01:32.880 
real trick on this car is that it

00:01:32.880 --> 00:01:35.330 
real trick on this car is that it
handles<00:01:33.180> like<00:01:33.600> adrian<00:01:34.470> peterson<00:01:34.619> trying<00:01:35.250> to

00:01:35.330 --> 00:01:35.340 
handles like adrian peterson trying to

00:01:35.340 --> 00:01:37.219 
handles like adrian peterson trying to
evade<00:01:35.640> traffic<00:01:36.180> out<00:01:36.329> in<00:01:36.420> the<00:01:36.509> open<00:01:36.810> field<00:01:37.079> i

00:01:37.219 --> 00:01:37.229 
evade traffic out in the open field i

00:01:37.229 --> 00:01:38.870
