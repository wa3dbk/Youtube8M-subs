little bit at this point we've got the

00:02:01.130 --> 00:02:03.160 
little bit at this point we've got the
passenger<00:02:01.549> side<00:02:01.880> wheel<00:02:02.119> was<00:02:02.479> completely<00:02:02.960> cut

00:02:03.160 --> 00:02:03.170 
passenger side wheel was completely cut

00:02:03.170 --> 00:02:05.989 
passenger side wheel was completely cut
out<00:02:03.200> and<00:02:03.670> then<00:02:04.670> trimmed

00:02:05.989 --> 00:02:05.999 
out and then trimmed

00:02:05.999 --> 00:02:07.700 
out and then trimmed
we're<00:02:06.509> going<00:02:06.630> to<00:02:06.689> go<00:02:06.749> back<00:02:06.869> and<00:02:07.049> box<00:02:07.259> the<00:02:07.469> frame

we're going to go back and box the frame

00:02:07.710 --> 00:02:09.109 
we're going to go back and box the frame
and<00:02:07.979> you<00:02:08.039> have<00:02:08.160> to<00:02:08.250> notch<00:02:08.429> the<00:02:08.670> frame<00:02:08.910> in<00:02:09.060> a

00:02:09.109 --> 00:02:09.119 
and you have to notch the frame in a

00:02:09.119 --> 00:02:10.490 
and you have to notch the frame in a
couple<00:02:09.360> areas<00:02:09.539> we're<00:02:09.810> going<00:02:09.929> to<00:02:09.989> close<00:02:10.200> off

00:02:10.490 --> 00:02:10.500 
couple areas we're going to close off

00:02:17.150 --> 00:02:17.160 
the two clam shells meet here you can

00:02:17.160 --> 00:02:18.470 
the two clam shells meet here you can
see<00:02:17.280> on<00:02:17.400> the<00:02:17.489> driver's<00:02:17.910> side<00:02:18.030> we<00:02:18.180> still<00:02:18.330> have<00:02:18.450> a

00:02:18.470 --> 00:02:18.480 
see on the driver's side we still have a

00:02:18.480 --> 00:02:19.789 
see on the driver's side we still have a
little<00:02:18.690> bit<00:02:18.780> of<00:02:18.810> the<00:02:18.930> whale<00:02:19.080> oil<00:02:19.260> to<00:02:19.410> come<00:02:19.620> out

00:02:19.789 --> 00:02:19.799 
little bit of the whale oil to come out

00:02:19.799 --> 00:02:22.699 
little bit of the whale oil to come out
just<00:02:20.730> cutting<00:02:21.599> along<00:02:21.810> that<00:02:22.049> original<00:02:22.500> seam

00:02:22.699 --> 00:02:22.709 
just cutting along that original seam

00:02:22.709 --> 00:02:25.400 
just cutting along that original seam
we'll<00:02:22.980> go<00:02:23.099> back<00:02:23.340> and<00:02:23.370> trim<00:02:23.790> that<00:02:23.849> as<00:02:24.239> a<00:02:24.410> you

00:02:25.400 --> 00:02:25.410 
we'll go back and trim that as a you

00:02:25.410 --> 00:02:26.809 
we'll go back and trim that as a you
know<00:02:25.440> if<00:02:25.650> we<00:02:25.769> get<00:02:25.950> closer<00:02:26.190> to<00:02:26.340> fitting<00:02:26.670> that

00:02:26.809 --> 00:02:26.819 
know if we get closer to fitting that

00:02:26.819 --> 00:02:28.250 
know if we get closer to fitting that
tub<00:02:27.030> you<00:02:27.420> can<00:02:27.450> see<00:02:27.660> where<00:02:27.810> the<00:02:27.870> frame<00:02:28.080> has<00:02:28.230> been

with<00:02:33.750> eight<00:02:34.410> inch<00:02:34.860> steel<00:02:35.989> you'd<00:02:36.989> be<00:02:37.080> piecing

with eight inch steel you'd be piecing

00:02:39.319 --> 00:02:39.329 
that and the templates are I would say a

00:02:39.329 --> 00:02:42.589 
that and the templates are I would say a
guideline<00:02:40.310> see<00:02:41.310> I<00:02:41.340> would<00:02:41.790> think<00:02:41.940> every<00:02:42.239> car<00:02:42.450> is

00:02:42.589 --> 00:02:42.599 
guideline see I would think every car is

00:02:42.599 --> 00:02:43.580 
guideline see I would think every car is
going<00:02:42.750> to<00:02:42.810> be<00:02:42.930> a<00:02:42.959> little<00:02:43.230> bit<00:02:43.349> different

00:02:43.580 --> 00:02:43.590 
going to be a little bit different

00:02:43.590 --> 00:02:44.809 
going to be a little bit different
there's<00:02:43.950> going<00:02:44.069> to<00:02:44.129> be<00:02:44.190> different<00:02:44.610> cuts

00:02:44.809 --> 00:02:44.819 
there's going to be different cuts

00:02:44.819 --> 00:02:46.190 
there's going to be different cuts
there's<00:02:45.120> going<00:02:45.209> to<00:02:45.269> be<00:02:45.329> different<00:02:45.720> you<00:02:46.140> know

00:02:46.190 --> 00:02:46.200 
there's going to be different you know

00:02:46.200 --> 00:02:49.220 
there's going to be different you know
different<00:02:46.470> bends<00:02:47.390> the<00:02:48.390> idea<00:02:48.810> is<00:02:49.019> to

00:02:49.220 --> 00:02:49.230 
different bends the idea is to

00:02:49.230 --> 00:02:52.789 
different bends the idea is to
strengthen<00:02:49.530> that<00:02:49.890> section<00:02:50.370> up<00:02:51.440> at<00:02:52.440> the<00:02:52.590> same

00:02:52.789 --> 00:02:52.799 
strengthen that section up at the same

00:02:52.799 --> 00:02:54.800 
strengthen that section up at the same
time<00:02:53.040> obviously<00:02:53.489> allowing<00:02:54.239> more<00:02:54.390> clearance

00:02:54.800 --> 00:02:54.810 
time obviously allowing more clearance

00:02:54.810 --> 00:02:57.979 
time obviously allowing more clearance
for<00:02:55.140> the<00:02:55.230> larger<00:02:55.620> tub<00:02:56.150> the<00:02:57.150> way<00:02:57.299> I<00:02:57.329> have<00:02:57.660> it<00:02:57.690> cut

00:02:57.979 --> 00:02:57.989 
for the larger tub the way I have it cut

00:02:57.989 --> 00:03:01.039 
for the larger tub the way I have it cut
now<00:02:58.200> if<00:02:58.470> I<00:02:58.590> set<00:02:58.890> that<00:02:59.099> II<00:02:59.180> eight-inch<00:03:00.180> piece<00:03:00.569> in

00:03:01.039 --> 00:03:01.049 
now if I set that II eight-inch piece in

00:03:01.049 --> 00:03:04.190 
now if I set that II eight-inch piece in
there<00:03:02.269> should<00:03:03.269> be<00:03:03.359> plenty<00:03:03.540> of<00:03:03.690> clearance<00:03:03.959> for

00:03:04.190 --> 00:03:04.200 
there should be plenty of clearance for

00:03:04.200 --> 00:03:06.680 
there should be plenty of clearance for
the<00:03:04.290> tub<00:03:04.500> and<00:03:04.739> plenty<00:03:05.340> of<00:03:05.430> clearance<00:03:05.670> for<00:03:06.150> the

00:03:06.680 --> 00:03:06.690 
the tub and plenty of clearance for the

00:03:06.690 --> 00:03:09.110 
the tub and plenty of clearance for the
tire<00:03:06.930> which<00:03:07.260> you<00:03:07.410> know<00:03:07.530> your<00:03:08.400> end<00:03:08.549> result<00:03:08.940> is

00:03:09.110 --> 00:03:09.120 
tire which you know your end result is

00:03:09.120 --> 00:03:12.170 
tire which you know your end result is
basically<00:03:09.540> two<00:03:09.690> and<00:03:09.810> a<00:03:09.840> half<00:03:10.019> inches<00:03:10.440> and<00:03:11.180> I

00:03:12.170 --> 00:03:12.180 
basically two and a half inches and I

00:03:12.180 --> 00:03:14.870 
basically two and a half inches and I
got<00:03:12.599> to<00:03:12.690> be<00:03:12.780> perfectly<00:03:13.170> honest<00:03:13.560> with<00:03:13.680> you<00:03:13.880> it's

00:03:14.870 --> 00:03:14.880 
got to be perfectly honest with you it's

00:03:14.880 --> 00:03:16.760 
got to be perfectly honest with you it's
a<00:03:15.000> lot<00:03:15.209> of<00:03:15.329> work<00:03:15.450> for<00:03:15.690> two<00:03:15.720> and<00:03:15.930> a<00:03:15.959> half<00:03:16.019> inch

00:03:16.760 --> 00:03:16.770 
a lot of work for two and a half inch

passenger side now you can see where we

00:03:18.750 --> 00:03:20.270 
passenger side now you can see where we
had<00:03:18.900> to<00:03:18.990> notch<00:03:19.170> the<00:03:19.410> frame<00:03:19.650> and<00:03:19.860> move<00:03:20.010> it<00:03:20.160> in

00:03:20.270 --> 00:03:20.280 
had to notch the frame and move it in

00:03:20.280 --> 00:03:21.800 
had to notch the frame and move it in
board<00:03:20.520> so<00:03:21.120> we're<00:03:21.360> gonna<00:03:21.450> do<00:03:21.630> now<00:03:21.780> is

concentrate on boxing that area up

00:03:25.130 --> 00:03:29.990 
concentrate on boxing that area up
basically<00:03:27.080> bent<00:03:28.080> the<00:03:28.230> piece<00:03:28.490> to<00:03:29.490> match<00:03:29.700> that

00:03:29.990 --> 00:03:30.000 
basically bent the piece to match that

00:03:30.000 --> 00:03:31.880 
basically bent the piece to match that
we're<00:03:30.240> gonna<00:03:30.360> fit<00:03:30.600> it<00:03:30.720> up<00:03:30.840> in<00:03:30.990> their<00:03:31.200> eighth
