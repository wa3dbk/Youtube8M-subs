z-tech and June as you can see here what
I<00:00:11.759> want<00:00:11.910> to<00:00:12.000> show<00:00:12.150> you<00:00:12.210> is<00:00:12.540> we<00:00:12.719> have<00:00:12.840> the<00:00:13.019> the

00:00:13.430 --> 00:00:13.440 
I want to show you is we have the the

00:00:13.440 --> 00:00:15.919 
I want to show you is we have the the
coil<00:00:13.710> leads<00:00:13.980> here<00:00:14.340> and<00:00:14.940> under<00:00:15.450> these<00:00:15.570> coil

00:00:15.919 --> 00:00:15.929 
coil leads here and under these coil

00:00:15.929 --> 00:00:19.580 
coil leads here and under these coil
leads<00:00:16.640> leads<00:00:17.640> to<00:00:18.000> the<00:00:18.300> obviously<00:00:19.140> the<00:00:19.199> spark

00:00:19.580 --> 00:00:19.590 
leads leads to the obviously the spark

00:00:19.590 --> 00:00:27.500 
leads leads to the obviously the spark
plugs<00:00:19.830> now<00:00:20.990> when<00:00:21.990> I<00:00:23.660> lift<00:00:24.660> out<00:00:24.900> this<00:00:25.109> coil<00:00:26.510> see

00:00:27.500 --> 00:00:27.510 
plugs now when I lift out this coil see

00:00:27.510 --> 00:00:33.790 
plugs now when I lift out this coil see
a<00:00:27.539> little<00:00:27.720> bit<00:00:27.930> of<00:00:27.990> oil<00:00:28.109> on<00:00:28.260> the<00:00:28.380> end<00:00:28.529> there<00:00:30.439> and

00:00:33.790 --> 00:00:33.800 

00:00:33.800 --> 00:00:38.569 

try<00:00:34.800> and<00:00:34.950> do<00:00:35.100> is<00:00:35.899> that's<00:00:36.899> the<00:00:37.079> hole<00:00:37.579> where

00:00:38.569 --> 00:00:38.579 
try and do is that's the hole where

00:00:38.579 --> 00:00:40.160 
try and do is that's the hole where
these<00:00:38.790> spark<00:00:39.120> plug<00:00:39.329> is<00:00:39.360> and<00:00:39.629> I'm<00:00:39.690> going<00:00:39.870> to<00:00:39.930> try

00:00:40.160 --> 00:00:40.170 
these spark plug is and I'm going to try

00:00:40.170 --> 00:00:42.500 
these spark plug is and I'm going to try
and<00:00:40.399> just<00:00:41.399> get<00:00:41.579> an<00:00:41.670> extra<00:00:41.969> bit<00:00:42.059> of<00:00:42.120> light<00:00:42.329> here

00:00:42.500 --> 00:00:42.510 
and just get an extra bit of light here

00:00:42.510 --> 00:00:49.540 
and just get an extra bit of light here
so<00:00:43.460> you<00:00:44.460> can<00:00:44.640> see<00:00:45.440> inside<00:00:46.440> there

00:00:49.540 --> 00:00:49.550 

00:00:49.550 --> 00:00:53.740 

basically<00:00:50.550> the<00:00:51.620> it's<00:00:52.620> filled<00:00:52.920> with<00:00:53.010> oil

00:00:53.740 --> 00:00:53.750 
basically the it's filled with oil

00:00:53.750 --> 00:00:57.799 
basically the it's filled with oil
around<00:00:54.750> the<00:00:54.870> spark<00:00:55.379> plug<00:00:56.449> now<00:00:57.449> that<00:00:57.570> probably

00:00:57.799 --> 00:00:57.809 
around the spark plug now that probably

00:00:57.809 --> 00:01:02.209 
around the spark plug now that probably
means<00:00:58.289> that<00:00:58.500> there<00:00:58.859> is<00:00:58.890> a<00:01:00.949> fault<00:01:01.949> with<00:01:02.129> the

00:01:02.209 --> 00:01:02.219 
means that there is a fault with the

00:01:02.219 --> 00:01:04.939 
means that there is a fault with the
gasket<00:01:02.640> the<00:01:03.480> valve<00:01:03.690> cover<00:01:03.989> gasket<00:01:04.439> so<00:01:04.619> we<00:01:04.739> need

00:01:04.939 --> 00:01:04.949 
gasket the valve cover gasket so we need

00:01:04.949 --> 00:01:08.990 
gasket the valve cover gasket so we need
to<00:01:05.930> change<00:01:06.930> that<00:01:07.110> over<00:01:07.380> now<00:01:07.820> I've<00:01:08.820> already

00:01:08.990 --> 00:01:09.000 
to change that over now I've already

00:01:09.000 --> 00:01:12.289 
to change that over now I've already
checked<00:01:09.240> that<00:01:09.360> one<00:01:09.600> so<00:01:09.869> far<00:01:11.060> what<00:01:12.060> I'm<00:01:12.150> gonna

00:01:12.289 --> 00:01:12.299 
checked that one so far what I'm gonna

00:01:12.299 --> 00:01:14.510 
checked that one so far what I'm gonna
do<00:01:12.600> is<00:01:12.900> just<00:01:13.380> pull<00:01:13.560> that<00:01:13.619> back<00:01:13.860> for<00:01:14.040> now<00:01:14.189> just

00:01:14.510 --> 00:01:14.520 
do is just pull that back for now just

00:01:14.520 --> 00:01:15.140 
do is just pull that back for now just
rest<00:01:14.790> it<00:01:14.939> there

00:01:15.140 --> 00:01:15.150 
rest it there

00:01:15.150 --> 00:01:19.550 
rest it there
check<00:01:16.020> it<00:01:16.170> a<00:01:16.290> different<00:01:17.009> one<00:01:18.290> little<00:01:19.290> bit<00:01:19.439> of

00:01:19.550 --> 00:01:19.560 
check it a different one little bit of

00:01:19.560 --> 00:01:20.840 
check it a different one little bit of
seems<00:01:19.979> like<00:01:20.070> there's<00:01:20.250> a<00:01:20.310> little<00:01:20.580> bit<00:01:20.670> of<00:01:20.700> oil

00:01:20.840 --> 00:01:20.850 
seems like there's a little bit of oil

00:01:20.850 --> 00:01:24.080 
seems like there's a little bit of oil
there<00:01:21.119> let's<00:01:21.840> get<00:01:22.020> my<00:01:22.140> light<00:01:22.320> again<00:01:22.970> that<00:01:23.970> one

00:01:24.080 --> 00:01:24.090 
there let's get my light again that one

00:01:24.090 --> 00:01:25.999 
there let's get my light again that one
seems<00:01:24.390> okay<00:01:24.780> actually<00:01:25.170> there's<00:01:25.500> a<00:01:25.590> little<00:01:25.770> bit

00:01:25.999 --> 00:01:26.009 
seems okay actually there's a little bit

00:01:26.009 --> 00:01:33.490 
seems okay actually there's a little bit
of<00:01:26.100> oil

00:01:33.490 --> 00:01:33.500 

00:01:33.500 --> 00:01:54.280 

-<00:01:34.070> an<00:01:34.220> actual

00:01:54.280 --> 00:01:54.290 

00:01:54.290 --> 00:01:58.990 

that<00:01:55.280> one's<00:01:55.430> completely<00:01:56.150> dry<00:01:56.770> and<00:01:57.820> I<00:01:58.820> can

00:01:58.990 --> 00:01:59.000 
that one's completely dry and I can

00:01:59.000 --> 00:02:01.900 
that one's completely dry and I can
actually<00:01:59.360> see<00:01:59.810> through<00:02:00.310> into<00:02:01.310> the<00:02:01.550> next<00:02:01.790> one

00:02:01.900 --> 00:02:01.910 
actually see through into the next one

00:02:01.910 --> 00:02:04.930 
actually see through into the next one
as<00:02:02.060> well<00:02:02.860> and<00:02:03.860> that<00:02:04.010> one<00:02:04.160> seems<00:02:04.370> dry<00:02:04.640> as<00:02:04.790> well

00:02:04.930 --> 00:02:04.940 
as well and that one seems dry as well

00:02:04.940 --> 00:02:08.139 
as well and that one seems dry as well
so<00:02:05.180> the<00:02:05.300> main<00:02:05.480> culprit<00:02:05.930> is<00:02:06.050> just<00:02:06.940> coil<00:02:07.940> one

00:02:08.139 --> 00:02:08.149 
so the main culprit is just coil one

00:02:08.149 --> 00:02:13.900 
so the main culprit is just coil one
here<00:02:10.840> now<00:02:11.840> what<00:02:12.020> a<00:02:12.050> thought<00:02:12.520> if<00:02:13.520> there<00:02:13.730> was<00:02:13.880> a

00:02:13.900 --> 00:02:13.910 
here now what a thought if there was a

00:02:13.910 --> 00:02:17.740 
here now what a thought if there was a
problem<00:02:14.180> with<00:02:14.540> the<00:02:15.430> gasket<00:02:16.430> then<00:02:16.820> all<00:02:17.390> of<00:02:17.450> them

00:02:17.740 --> 00:02:17.750 
problem with the gasket then all of them

00:02:17.750 --> 00:02:19.830 
problem with the gasket then all of them
would<00:02:17.870> be<00:02:18.050> but<00:02:18.710> I<00:02:18.770> could<00:02:18.950> be<00:02:19.040> wrong<00:02:19.160> on<00:02:19.310> that<00:02:19.370> so

00:02:19.830 --> 00:02:19.840 
would be but I could be wrong on that so

00:02:19.840 --> 00:02:22.290 
would be but I could be wrong on that so
by<00:02:20.840> all<00:02:21.020> means<00:02:21.290> if<00:02:21.590> you<00:02:21.770> do<00:02:21.890> have<00:02:22.070> any

00:02:22.290 --> 00:02:22.300

00:02:22.300 --> 00:02:25.560 
by all means if you do have any
suggestions<00:02:23.300> or<00:02:23.510> do<00:02:24.440> you<00:02:24.560> think<00:02:24.860> you<00:02:24.980> know

00:02:25.560 --> 00:02:25.570 
suggestions or do you think you know

00:02:25.570 --> 00:02:27.850 
suggestions or do you think you know
otherwise<00:02:26.570> as<00:02:26.870> to<00:02:27.020> why<00:02:27.170> there<00:02:27.380> might<00:02:27.500> be<00:02:27.530> oil

00:02:27.850 --> 00:02:27.860 
otherwise as to why there might be oil

00:02:27.860 --> 00:02:29.980 
otherwise as to why there might be oil
just<00:02:28.520> surrounding<00:02:29.060> the<00:02:29.180> first<00:02:29.390> two<00:02:29.630> spark

and<00:02:48.020> then<00:02:48.470> we'll<00:02:50.530> do<00:02:51.530> some<00:02:51.709> more<00:02:51.800> tests<00:02:52.310> take

00:02:53.290 --> 00:02:53.300 
and then we'll do some more tests take

00:02:53.300 --> 00:02:54.640 
and then we'll do some more tests take
it<00:02:53.390> out<00:02:53.480> for<00:02:53.600> a<00:02:53.660> drive<00:02:53.900> and<00:02:54.080> see<00:02:54.260> if<00:02:54.320> we<00:02:54.440> still

00:02:54.640 --> 00:02:54.650 
it out for a drive and see if we still

00:02:54.650 --> 00:02:58.720 
it out for a drive and see if we still
have<00:02:54.830> oil<00:02:55.070> in<00:02:55.340> the<00:02:55.959> cylinder<00:02:56.959> or<00:02:57.200> the<00:02:57.920> this

00:02:58.720 --> 00:02:58.730 
have oil in the cylinder or the this

00:02:58.730 --> 00:03:00.520 
have oil in the cylinder or the this
spark<00:02:59.000> plug<00:02:59.030> hole<00:02:59.360> there<00:02:59.600> first<00:03:00.260> one<00:03:00.410> that
