embody in my body because I'm chanting

00:02:57.680 --> 00:02:59.949 
embody in my body because I'm chanting
it<00:02:57.830> and<00:02:58.010> I'm<00:02:58.130> dancing<00:02:58.370> it<00:02:58.790> then<00:02:59.390> you<00:02:59.540> gotta<00:02:59.750> ask

00:02:59.949 --> 00:02:59.959 
it and I'm dancing it then you gotta ask

00:02:59.959 --> 00:03:03.280 
it and I'm dancing it then you gotta ask
yourself<00:03:00.230> oh<00:03:00.880> so<00:03:01.880> what<00:03:02.360> does<00:03:02.540> that<00:03:02.569> mean<00:03:02.930> to<00:03:03.140> my

00:03:03.280 --> 00:03:03.290 
yourself oh so what does that mean to my

00:03:03.290 --> 00:03:05.020 
yourself oh so what does that mean to my
well-being<00:03:03.799> does<00:03:04.040> that<00:03:04.220> contribute<00:03:04.549> to<00:03:04.790> it

00:03:05.020 --> 00:03:05.030 
well-being does that contribute to it

00:03:05.030 --> 00:03:07.720 
well-being does that contribute to it
and<00:03:05.209> if<00:03:05.690> it<00:03:05.870> does<00:03:06.110> then<00:03:06.890> it<00:03:07.069> can<00:03:07.220> contribute<00:03:07.549> to

00:03:07.720 --> 00:03:07.730 
and if it does then it can contribute to

00:03:07.730 --> 00:03:09.220 
and if it does then it can contribute to
the<00:03:07.940> well-being<00:03:08.120> of<00:03:08.420> other<00:03:08.630> people<00:03:09.080> but

00:03:09.220 --> 00:03:09.230 
the well-being of other people but

00:03:09.230 --> 00:03:11.410 
the well-being of other people but
here's<00:03:09.500> the<00:03:09.709> other<00:03:09.860> side<00:03:10.160> of<00:03:10.370> that<00:03:10.549> while<00:03:11.180> we

00:03:11.410 --> 00:03:11.420 
here's the other side of that while we

00:03:11.420 --> 00:03:13.750 
here's the other side of that while we
ask<00:03:11.599> our<00:03:11.930> Kumu<00:03:12.349> hula<00:03:12.530> in<00:03:12.830> our<00:03:12.950> generation<00:03:13.340> ask

00:03:13.750 --> 00:03:13.760 
ask our Kumu hula in our generation ask

00:03:13.760 --> 00:03:19.630 
ask our Kumu hula in our generation ask
ourselves<00:03:14.000> what<00:03:14.450> does<00:03:14.480> it<00:03:14.780> mean<00:03:15.080> then<00:03:18.640> there

00:03:19.630 --> 00:03:19.640 
ourselves what does it mean then there

00:03:19.640 --> 00:03:23.170 
ourselves what does it mean then there
we<00:03:19.819> say<00:03:20.030> but<00:03:20.750> what<00:03:21.019> if<00:03:21.170> it<00:03:21.410> what<00:03:22.160> if<00:03:22.459> embodying

00:03:23.170 --> 00:03:23.180 
we say but what if it what if embodying

00:03:23.180 --> 00:03:26.440 
we say but what if it what if embodying
all<00:03:23.480> of<00:03:23.810> this<00:03:23.959> information<00:03:25.090> what<00:03:26.090> if<00:03:26.239> that

00:03:26.440 --> 00:03:26.450 
all of this information what if that

00:03:26.450 --> 00:03:31.660 
all of this information what if that
gets<00:03:26.780> stuck<00:03:27.410> in<00:03:27.650> us<00:03:29.109> and<00:03:30.370> what<00:03:31.370> if<00:03:31.489> it<00:03:31.640> doesn't

00:03:31.660 --> 00:03:31.670 
gets stuck in us and what if it doesn't

00:03:31.670 --> 00:03:36.190 
gets stuck in us and what if it doesn't
move<00:03:32.350> beyond<00:03:33.400> the<00:03:34.400> choreography<00:03:35.329> then<00:03:35.959> what

00:03:36.190 --> 00:03:36.200 
move beyond the choreography then what

00:03:36.200 --> 00:03:39.640 
move beyond the choreography then what
happens<00:03:36.620> to<00:03:36.950> this<00:03:37.940> spirit<00:03:38.450> here<00:03:38.720> so<00:03:39.290> I<00:03:39.319> mean

00:03:39.640 --> 00:03:39.650 
happens to this spirit here so I mean

00:03:39.650 --> 00:03:41.229 
happens to this spirit here so I mean
that's<00:03:39.859> kind<00:03:39.980> of<00:03:40.130> abstract<00:03:40.609> and<00:03:40.790> not<00:03:40.940> really

00:03:41.229 --> 00:03:41.239 
that's kind of abstract and not really

00:03:41.239 --> 00:03:43.240 
that's kind of abstract and not really
answer<00:03:41.569> the<00:03:41.750> question<00:03:41.780> of<00:03:42.260> marijuana<00:03:42.709> but

00:03:43.240 --> 00:03:43.250 
answer the question of marijuana but

00:03:43.250 --> 00:03:45.569 
answer the question of marijuana but
what<00:03:43.579> I'm<00:03:43.700> trying<00:03:43.970> to<00:03:44.060> say<00:03:44.269> is<00:03:44.510> that<00:03:45.079> the

00:03:45.569 --> 00:03:45.579 
what I'm trying to say is that the

00:03:45.579 --> 00:03:51.160 
what I'm trying to say is that the
global<00:03:46.579> view<00:03:47.180> of<00:03:48.160> hula<00:03:49.160> as<00:03:49.459> a<00:03:50.299> connective

00:03:51.160 --> 00:03:51.170 
global view of hula as a connective

00:03:51.170 --> 00:03:54.370 
global view of hula as a connective
piece<00:03:51.739> it's<00:03:52.609> a<00:03:52.760> relationship<00:03:53.600> creating<00:03:54.139> peace

00:03:54.370 --> 00:03:54.380 
piece it's a relationship creating peace

00:03:54.380 --> 00:03:55.330 
piece it's a relationship creating peace
that's<00:03:54.709> what<00:03:54.980> it<00:03:55.130> is

00:03:55.330 --> 00:03:55.340 
that's what it is

00:03:55.340 --> 00:03:57.099 
that's what it is
and<00:03:55.579> when<00:03:55.760> you<00:03:55.910> said<00:03:56.150> Dancing<00:03:56.690> with<00:03:56.870> the

00:03:57.099 --> 00:03:57.109 
and when you said Dancing with the

00:03:57.109 --> 00:04:00.460 
and when you said Dancing with the
goddess<00:03:57.590> in<00:03:57.769> my<00:03:58.340> mind<00:03:58.670> I'm<00:03:59.000> thinking<00:03:59.410> I'm<00:04:00.410> the

00:04:00.460 --> 00:04:00.470 
goddess in my mind I'm thinking I'm the

00:04:00.470 --> 00:04:05.910 
goddess in my mind I'm thinking I'm the
goddess<00:04:00.980> dancing

00:04:05.910 --> 00:04:05.920 

00:04:05.920 --> 00:04:09.870 

and<00:04:06.460> because<00:04:07.360> our<00:04:08.170> exchange<00:04:09.069> of<00:04:09.340> energy<00:04:09.790> is

00:04:09.870 --> 00:04:09.880 
and because our exchange of energy is

00:04:09.880 --> 00:04:13.830 
and because our exchange of energy is
the<00:04:09.910> same<00:04:10.300> exchange<00:04:10.870> and<00:04:11.760> to<00:04:12.760> bring<00:04:13.150> I<00:04:13.510> think

00:04:13.830 --> 00:04:13.840 
the same exchange and to bring I think

00:04:13.840 --> 00:04:16.470 
the same exchange and to bring I think
to<00:04:13.959> bring<00:04:14.140> the<00:04:14.500> story<00:04:14.950> and<00:04:15.250> the<00:04:15.370> images<00:04:15.970> and

00:04:16.470 --> 00:04:16.480 
to bring the story and the images and

00:04:16.480 --> 00:04:19.289 
to bring the story and the images and
launch<00:04:17.380> and<00:04:17.709> throw<00:04:17.890> marijuana<00:04:18.400> is<00:04:18.670> a<00:04:18.910> great

00:04:19.289 --> 00:04:19.299 
launch and throw marijuana is a great

00:04:19.299 --> 00:04:21.479 
launch and throw marijuana is a great
thing<00:04:19.570> because<00:04:19.780> we're<00:04:20.739> just<00:04:20.950> shifting<00:04:21.190> a

00:04:21.479 --> 00:04:21.489 
thing because we're just shifting a

00:04:21.489 --> 00:04:23.790 
thing because we're just shifting a
little<00:04:21.790> we're<00:04:22.120> you<00:04:22.990> know<00:04:23.110> we're<00:04:23.260> not<00:04:23.350> doing

00:04:23.790 --> 00:04:23.800 
little we're you know we're not doing

00:04:23.800 --> 00:04:26.580 
little we're you know we're not doing
things<00:04:24.070> any<00:04:24.340> differently<00:04:25.050> we're<00:04:26.050> just<00:04:26.380> taking

00:04:26.580 --> 00:04:26.590 
things any differently we're just taking

00:04:26.590 --> 00:04:30.450 
things any differently we're just taking
the<00:04:26.980> next<00:04:27.250> step<00:04:27.760> in<00:04:28.080> articulating<00:04:29.080> and<00:04:29.470> asking

00:04:30.450 --> 00:04:30.460 
the next step in articulating and asking

00:04:30.460 --> 00:04:33.120 
the next step in articulating and asking
the<00:04:30.580> question<00:04:31.540> what<00:04:31.750> does<00:04:31.930> it<00:04:31.990> mean<00:04:32.380> these

00:04:33.120 --> 00:04:33.130 
the question what does it mean these

00:04:33.130 --> 00:04:34.860 
the question what does it mean these
things<00:04:33.490> over<00:04:33.730> here<00:04:33.970> and<00:04:34.120> then<00:04:34.419> these<00:04:34.630> things

00:04:34.860 --> 00:04:34.870 
things over here and then these things

00:04:34.870 --> 00:04:36.630 
things over here and then these things
over<00:04:35.169> here<00:04:35.320> and<00:04:35.500> then<00:04:35.830> these<00:04:36.070> things<00:04:36.370> back

00:04:36.630 --> 00:04:36.640 
over here and then these things back

00:04:36.640 --> 00:04:38.670 
over here and then these things back
there<00:04:36.940> but<00:04:37.270> what's<00:04:37.450> most<00:04:37.660> important<00:04:38.290> is<00:04:38.410> what

00:04:38.670 --> 00:04:38.680 
there but what's most important is what

00:04:38.680 --> 00:04:40.560 
there but what's most important is what
is<00:04:38.830> our<00:04:39.010> relationship<00:04:39.550> to<00:04:39.910> what<00:04:40.090> we're<00:04:40.270> doing

00:04:40.560 --> 00:04:40.570 
is our relationship to what we're doing

00:04:40.570 --> 00:04:43.650 
is our relationship to what we're doing
if<00:04:40.750> all<00:04:41.350> the<00:04:41.500> hula<00:04:41.710> people<00:04:42.190> could<00:04:43.030> understand

00:04:43.650 --> 00:04:43.660 
if all the hula people could understand

00:04:43.660 --> 00:04:46.440 
if all the hula people could understand
that<00:04:43.750> they<00:04:44.020> can<00:04:44.230> have<00:04:44.500> an<00:04:45.460> individual

00:04:46.440 --> 00:04:46.450 
that they can have an individual

00:04:46.450 --> 00:04:48.810 
that they can have an individual
relationship<00:04:47.380> with<00:04:47.620> energies<00:04:48.220> like<00:04:48.250> the

00:04:48.810 --> 00:04:48.820 
relationship with energies like the

00:04:48.820 --> 00:04:51.840 
relationship with energies like the
pivot<00:04:49.210> and<00:04:49.650> if<00:04:50.650> they<00:04:50.830> could<00:04:51.070> understand<00:04:51.640> that

00:04:51.840 --> 00:04:51.850 
pivot and if they could understand that

00:04:51.850 --> 00:04:54.720 
pivot and if they could understand that
those<00:04:52.240> energies<00:04:52.870> occur<00:04:53.380> in<00:04:53.830> the<00:04:54.100> dances<00:04:54.700> that

00:04:54.720 --> 00:04:54.730 
those energies occur in the dances that

00:04:54.730 --> 00:04:58.920 
those energies occur in the dances that
they<00:04:55.150> dance<00:04:55.660> all<00:04:56.169> the<00:04:57.130> time<00:04:57.580> maybe<00:04:58.540> except<00:04:58.900> for

00:04:58.920 --> 00:04:58.930 
they dance all the time maybe except for

00:04:58.930 --> 00:05:01.170 
they dance all the time maybe except for
having<00:04:59.440> good<00:04:59.560> hands<00:04:59.890> I<00:04:59.980> don't<00:05:00.040> know<00:05:00.220> or<00:05:00.640> not
