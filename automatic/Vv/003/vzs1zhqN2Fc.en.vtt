00:00:09.050 --> 00:00:13.170
 and hello to all his friends 

00:00:11.250 --> 00:00:14.580
 cinematics are overcouf new video 

00:00:13.170 --> 00:00:17.070
 which is to show you the 

00:00:14.580 --> 00:00:18.840
 best hdv village so the video 

00:00:17.070 --> 00:00:22.170
 will get organized in three parts I will you 

00:00:18.840 --> 00:00:24.750
 shows the village type defense south 

00:00:22.170 --> 00:00:26.369
 farming and to finish hybrid is so 

00:00:24.750 --> 00:00:28.560
 then we will begin immediately to 

00:00:26.369 --> 00:00:31.260
 places in hd in the center of the village 

00:00:28.560 --> 00:00:32.850
 and as you know that the ball coming 

00:00:31.260 --> 00:00:34.680
 not much difference so we're going 

00:00:32.850 --> 00:00:37.350
 to pass immediately a mud you go 

00:00:34.680 --> 00:00:41.010
 able to protect the entire village there 

00:00:37.350 --> 00:00:42.780
 have a scope on everything done on 

00:00:41.010 --> 00:00:45.690
 all ground troops and 

00:00:42.780 --> 00:00:49.230
 so the living torch and the 

00:00:45.690 --> 00:00:50.670
 brain of Commons anti- aircraft defense 

00:00:49.230 --> 00:00:53.670
 so for those who do not know it's 

00:00:50.670 --> 00:00:57.180
 a defense that makes it possible to strike 

00:00:53.670 --> 00:00:58.739
 targets them only airborne so 

00:00:57.180 --> 00:01:01.440
 also which will have the two small 

00:00:58.739 --> 00:01:03.840
 channels on the sides that will protect 

00:01:01.440 --> 00:01:05.479
 the left and the fingers of the village and 

00:01:03.840 --> 00:01:08.340
 also the front and the back 

00:01:05.479 --> 00:01:11.700
 they are well disposed of actually who are 

00:01:08.340 --> 00:01:16.200
 a bit of a mistake in the middle and 

00:01:11.700 --> 00:01:20.490
 equal distance from the village in radio that 

00:01:16.200 --> 00:01:23.159
 like that mines tanks etc 

00:01:20.490 --> 00:01:25.830
 and so that's where 

00:01:23.159 --> 00:01:28.590
 gold tanks and elections are at 

00:01:25.830 --> 00:01:31.979
 outside but do not worry 

00:01:28.590 --> 00:01:35.780
 for that because normally we go 

00:01:31.979 --> 00:01:37.680
 place our little hut in the point 

00:01:35.780 --> 00:01:40.140
 history of 

00:01:37.680 --> 00:01:41.250
 moors was the enemy so I said 

00:01:40.140 --> 00:01:44.400
 do not worry because 

00:01:41.250 --> 00:01:46.440
 that we have our two channels that protects and 

00:01:44.400 --> 00:01:48.030
 our archers turn and goal too 

00:01:46.440 --> 00:01:50.130
 of a kind of ancient rock country effects 

00:01:48.030 --> 00:01:52.080
 the trophies so there you if you 

00:01:50.130 --> 00:01:53.820
 try not to need rather to 

00:01:52.080 --> 00:01:55.590
 protect your hdd so there you can 

00:01:53.820 --> 00:01:57.710
 see sticking of the barrel protects quite well 

00:01:55.590 --> 00:01:59.880
 and latour darche and protects in front also 

00:01:57.710 --> 00:02:02.460
 so do not be afraid 

00:01:59.880 --> 00:02:06.119
 the village has been well thought out well design 

00:02:02.460 --> 00:02:08.310
 and so that it is to your liking so 

00:02:06.119 --> 00:02:12.570
 normally still bogged down want it 

00:02:08.310 --> 00:02:17.130
 to slow down enemies as much as possible 

00:02:12.570 --> 00:02:23.300
 so we'll all go to the village of 

00:02:17.130 --> 00:02:23.300
 farmin type go it's good sign 

00:02:29.270 --> 00:02:32.360
 so we'll start right away with 

00:02:30.710 --> 00:02:33.950
 the flagship title mines so for those who 

00:02:32.360 --> 00:02:37.610
 have just started cash ofc launches 

00:02:33.950 --> 00:02:38.810
 so the site swarms the goal is to 

00:02:37.610 --> 00:02:40.250
 protect your resources 

00:02:38.810 --> 00:02:43.070
 that is to say that we will place at 

00:02:40.250 --> 00:02:44.960
 outside the age of life so when 

00:02:43.070 --> 00:02:47.600
 the enemy will attack the age he will do 

00:02:44.960 --> 00:02:49.520
 a star him who has so good for him and 

00:02:47.600 --> 00:02:51.230
 bad for us because we are going to lose 

00:02:49.520 --> 00:02:51.790
 trophies but it's not the most 

00:02:51.230 --> 00:02:55.250
 important 

00:02:51.790 --> 00:02:57.680
 we will sell shield about 12 

00:02:55.250 --> 00:03:00.350
 hours and it can go up to grab 

00:02:57.680 --> 00:03:02.570
 it depends on the opponent 

00:03:00.350 --> 00:03:08.570
 the pits revenge and that he did 

00:03:02.570 --> 00:03:10.430
 100% on you he will give you the 

00:03:08.570 --> 00:03:11.900
 shield decision but if he only has 

00:03:10.430 --> 00:03:13.310
 attacked the age of the cards think he's going 

00:03:11.900 --> 00:03:14.300
 give you you watch 12 hours or 

00:03:13.310 --> 00:03:17.150
 of 14 

00:03:14.300 --> 00:03:20.720
 so we put the two gold tanks 

00:03:17.150 --> 00:03:24.560
 and elections in the village center 

00:03:20.720 --> 00:03:26.810
 we protected with neither creeping nor from 

00:03:24.560 --> 00:03:30.050
 and other 

00:03:26.810 --> 00:03:31.760
 of the village replace the two guns they 

00:03:30.050 --> 00:03:33.680
 are also waiting for it to protect 

00:03:31.760 --> 00:03:35.810
 as usual the whole and the 

00:03:33.680 --> 00:03:40.160
 village surface to protect your 

00:03:35.810 --> 00:03:43.069
 this case the goal really the imperative there 

00:03:40.160 --> 00:03:45.260
 it's about protecting your resources so 

00:03:43.069 --> 00:03:47.810
 the enemy there to enter the faith the organ 

00:03:45.260 --> 00:03:52.010
 is unable to do his 

00:03:47.810 --> 00:03:55.010
 nest gyan or no I do not think about it 

00:03:52.010 --> 00:03:56.450
 fun we can still make giants 

00:03:55.010 --> 00:03:58.970
 I went to enthrall there 

00:03:56.450 --> 00:04:00.440
 would have that against that I forget but you 

00:03:58.970 --> 00:04:02.060
 can I shove them in the 

00:04:00.440 --> 00:04:05.569
 description when you arrived 

00:04:02.060 --> 00:04:07.940
 eight pages quickly h confuses me wishes 

00:04:05.569 --> 00:04:11.450
 2 to givet you made religious 

00:04:07.940 --> 00:04:12.980
 it seems like no so she sees it 

00:04:11.450 --> 00:04:15.739
 you only attack and giants 

00:04:12.980 --> 00:04:18.440
 not said gyan barbarians or archers 

00:04:15.739 --> 00:04:22.100
 so here I show you cannon protect 

00:04:18.440 --> 00:04:25.010
 together too many orchies so that's it 

00:04:22.100 --> 00:04:27.440
 the design is over and we end up 

00:04:25.010 --> 00:04:30.320
 right away for the last type of 

00:04:27.440 --> 00:04:35.060
 village and semi hybrids that mix 

00:04:30.320 --> 00:04:40.180
 the difference is a bit let's say the 

00:04:35.060 --> 00:04:40.180
 blush neither so it's good 

00:04:44.380 --> 00:04:47.960
 so friends we meet for the 

00:04:46.520 --> 00:04:49.340
 last type of village that is alone 

00:04:47.960 --> 00:04:51.830
 of hybrids as I had said 

00:04:49.340 --> 00:04:54.500
 previously that mixes the rush the 

00:04:51.830 --> 00:04:56.120
 difference we're going to say that like this and the 

00:04:54.500 --> 00:04:58.430
 women so first of all we will place 

00:04:56.120 --> 00:05:01.160
 our little tour to the market in the middle of 

00:04:58.430 --> 00:05:06.290
 town about let's say it like 

00:05:01.160 --> 00:05:08.360
 that and we will dispose the defenses and 

00:05:06.290 --> 00:05:10.100
 ramparts like this so I hold everything 

00:05:08.360 --> 00:05:11.780
 first to you or that most in 

00:05:10.100 --> 00:05:14.990
 the three villages rather than I come 

00:05:11.780 --> 00:05:16.490
 present I said I chose 

00:05:14.990 --> 00:05:19.760
 because you have to know how to find 

00:05:16.490 --> 00:05:21.650
 the journey of the v8 game little tale that is 

00:05:19.760 --> 00:05:25.460
 he too passengers avoidance small 

00:05:21.650 --> 00:05:26.060
 63 and still want my big 

00:05:25.460 --> 00:05:30.730
 accounts 

00:05:26.060 --> 00:05:32.890
 current keselj they want 60,78 

00:05:30.730 --> 00:05:36.800
 soon 79 

00:05:32.890 --> 00:05:38.390
 so I have time to decide all that 

00:05:36.800 --> 00:05:42.770
 I will offer you the money 

00:05:38.390 --> 00:05:45.020
 come port which and now so here's 

00:05:42.770 --> 00:05:47.840
 so that you have passed your cannon 

00:05:45.020 --> 00:05:51.110
 like this wake of the v as you want 

00:05:47.840 --> 00:05:53.210
 see it and middle in the center and there 

00:05:51.110 --> 00:05:54.950
 was going from the canoe the money tower that 

00:05:53.210 --> 00:05:58.970
 protect it's not bad and more 

00:05:54.950 --> 00:06:00.920
 it's pretty aesthetic and what is it 

00:05:58.970 --> 00:06:03.080
 when you see that you do not have that 

00:06:00.920 --> 00:06:05.090
 you want to attack because the 

00:06:03.080 --> 00:06:07.550
 defenses have pretty well arranged here 

00:06:05.090 --> 00:06:10.510
 I think that at the bottom the want do 

00:06:07.550 --> 00:06:13.270
 least started as my village for 

00:06:10.510 --> 00:06:16.210
 not to scare but 

00:06:13.270 --> 00:06:17.830
 a little distant enemies when 

00:06:16.210 --> 00:06:21.160
 personally if I were to go 

00:06:17.830 --> 00:06:23.230
 play not attacked a village like that 

00:06:21.160 --> 00:06:25.870
 knowing that there are channels that are 

00:06:23.230 --> 00:06:27.640
 well protected even if you try to 

00:06:25.870 --> 00:06:29.350
 roy each no there is the other who goes the 

00:06:27.640 --> 00:06:31.810
 protect and turn it also you go 

00:06:29.350 --> 00:06:34.750
 you snipe is so in any case 

00:06:31.810 --> 00:06:36.250
 you are a little trapped so he 

00:06:34.750 --> 00:06:37.180
 going to have to is the right strategy 

00:06:36.250 --> 00:06:40.210
 the attack 

00:06:37.180 --> 00:06:41.680
 this is very effective so here we end up 

00:06:40.210 --> 00:06:43.120
 the worker huts I think that 

00:06:41.680 --> 00:06:46.270
 basel want you are you have it at 

00:06:43.120 --> 00:06:48.460
 least two or three I do not know if 

00:06:46.270 --> 00:06:51.010
 you're pretty good but normally we 

00:06:48.460 --> 00:06:55.060
 was only 2 here are the two channels 

00:06:51.010 --> 00:06:56.500
 which protects so on this month I tell you 

00:06:55.060 --> 00:06:59.880
 to have a good time and if you are 

00:06:56.500 --> 00:06:59.880
 young and x or y is
