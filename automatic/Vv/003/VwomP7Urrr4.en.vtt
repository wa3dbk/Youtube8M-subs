00:00:50.150 --> 00:00:50.160 
a lot of baking is very precise but in

00:00:50.160 --> 00:00:51.889 
a lot of baking is very precise but in
something<00:00:50.610> like<00:00:50.760> this<00:00:51.000> you<00:00:51.059> don't<00:00:51.420> have<00:00:51.600> to<00:00:51.750> be

00:00:51.889 --> 00:00:51.899 
something like this you don't have to be

00:00:51.899 --> 00:00:53.930 
something like this you don't have to be
worried<00:00:52.260> the<00:00:52.500> eggs<00:00:52.739> will<00:00:53.160> really<00:00:53.579> bind

00:00:53.930 --> 00:00:53.940 
worried the eggs will really bind

00:00:53.940 --> 00:00:55.939 
worried the eggs will really bind
everything<00:00:54.390> together<00:00:54.750> and<00:00:55.320> hold<00:00:55.620> them

everything together and hold them

00:00:55.949 --> 00:00:58.520 
everything together and hold them

00:00:58.520 --> 00:00:58.530 
together so that the fillings as they

00:00:58.530 --> 00:01:01.400 
together so that the fillings as they
say<00:00:58.739> sets<00:00:59.100> up<00:00:59.460> yeah<00:01:00.239> this<00:01:00.510> actually<00:01:00.719> helps<00:01:01.260> to

00:01:01.400 --> 00:01:01.410

we're going to put a pinch of cream of

00:02:04.709 --> 00:02:08.120 
we're going to put a pinch of cream of
tartar<00:02:05.490> which<00:02:05.850> will<00:02:06.090> stabilise<00:02:06.780> the<00:02:07.229> whites<00:02:07.770> a

00:02:08.120 --> 00:02:08.130 
tartar which will stabilise the whites a

00:02:08.130 --> 00:02:17.490 
tartar which will stabilise the whites a
little<00:02:08.399> bit

00:02:17.490 --> 00:02:17.500 

00:02:17.500 --> 00:02:22.720 

see<00:02:18.500> that<00:02:19.540> is<00:02:20.540> holding<00:02:21.020> but<00:02:21.920> the<00:02:22.070> other<00:02:22.340> real

00:02:22.720 --> 00:02:22.730 
see that is holding but the other real

00:02:22.730 --> 00:02:25.630 
see that is holding but the other real
test<00:02:23.150> is<00:02:23.540> like<00:02:23.840> that<00:02:24.170> you<00:02:24.830> take<00:02:25.040> a<00:02:25.100> little<00:02:25.490> bit

00:02:25.630 --> 00:02:25.640 
test is like that you take a little bit

00:02:25.640 --> 00:02:28.390 
test is like that you take a little bit
of<00:02:25.760> it<00:02:25.910> and<00:02:26.090> you<00:02:26.570> rub<00:02:26.870> in<00:02:27.230> your<00:02:27.290> between<00:02:28.250> your

00:02:28.390 --> 00:02:28.400 
of it and you rub in your between your

00:02:28.400 --> 00:02:30.820 
of it and you rub in your between your
fingers<00:02:28.910> and<00:02:29.390> if<00:02:29.600> there's<00:02:29.840> no<00:02:30.020> grit<00:02:30.350> it<00:02:30.620> means

00:02:30.820 --> 00:02:30.830 
fingers and if there's no grit it means

00:02:30.830 --> 00:02:33.040 
fingers and if there's no grit it means
all<00:02:31.070> the<00:02:31.190> sugar<00:02:31.430> has<00:02:31.700> dissolved<00:02:31.870> Melissa<00:02:32.870> is

00:02:33.040 --> 00:02:33.050 
all the sugar has dissolved Melissa is

00:02:33.050 --> 00:02:37.450 
all the sugar has dissolved Melissa is
going<00:02:33.350> to<00:02:34.270> put<00:02:35.270> the<00:02:35.600> meringue<00:02:35.960> top<00:02:36.470> on<00:02:36.740> top<00:02:37.250> of

00:02:37.450 --> 00:02:37.460 
going to put the meringue top on top of

00:02:37.460 --> 00:02:40.090 
going to put the meringue top on top of
the<00:02:37.610> tart<00:02:37.940> and<00:02:38.210> there's<00:02:38.780> there's<00:02:39.440> a<00:02:39.500> trick<00:02:39.830> to

00:02:40.090 --> 00:02:40.100 
the tart and there's there's a trick to

00:02:40.100 --> 00:02:42.550 
the tart and there's there's a trick to
it<00:02:40.130> so<00:02:40.520> the<00:02:40.760> meringue<00:02:41.090> adheres<00:02:41.750> to<00:02:42.050> the<00:02:42.170> crust

00:02:42.550 --> 00:02:42.560 
it so the meringue adheres to the crust

00:02:42.560 --> 00:02:46.240 
it so the meringue adheres to the crust
and<00:02:42.890> doesn't<00:02:43.460> shrink<00:02:43.670> away<00:02:44.050> you<00:02:45.050> first<00:02:45.470> you

00:02:46.240 --> 00:02:46.250 
and doesn't shrink away you first you

00:02:46.250 --> 00:02:48.880 
and doesn't shrink away you first you
want<00:02:46.460> to<00:02:46.550> make<00:02:46.700> sure<00:02:46.730> that<00:02:47.270> it<00:02:47.450> is<00:02:47.780> sticking<00:02:48.650> on

00:02:48.880 --> 00:02:48.890 
want to make sure that it is sticking on

00:02:48.890 --> 00:02:59.199 
want to make sure that it is sticking on
the<00:02:49.700> crust<00:02:50.420> like<00:02:50.959> that<00:02:57.580> nothing<00:02:58.580> but<00:02:58.970> egg
