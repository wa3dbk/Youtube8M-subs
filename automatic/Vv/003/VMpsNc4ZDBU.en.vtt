00:02:08.169 --> 00:02:08.179 
recommend using these wiffle balls

00:02:08.179 --> 00:02:10.669 
recommend using these wiffle balls
especially<00:02:09.179> for<00:02:09.450> the<00:02:09.720> wiffle<00:02:10.080> brand<00:02:10.319> wiffle

00:02:10.669 --> 00:02:10.679 
especially for the wiffle brand wiffle

00:02:10.679 --> 00:02:11.820 
especially for the wiffle brand wiffle
bats

00:02:11.820 --> 00:02:11.830 
bats

00:02:11.830 --> 00:02:13.530 
bats
and<00:02:11.920> most<00:02:12.580> wiffle<00:02:12.910> ball<00:02:13.000> bats<00:02:13.210> can't

00:02:13.530 --> 00:02:13.540 
and most wiffle ball bats can't

00:02:13.540 --> 00:02:16.320 
and most wiffle ball bats can't
withstand<00:02:13.690> like<00:02:14.430> these<00:02:15.430> big<00:02:15.730> with<00:02:15.940> while<00:02:16.150> bats

00:02:16.320 --> 00:02:16.330 
withstand like these big with while bats

00:02:16.330 --> 00:02:17.790 
withstand like these big with while bats
there's<00:02:16.690> not<00:02:16.840> little<00:02:17.320> balls<00:02:17.500> that<00:02:17.650> are

00:02:17.790 --> 00:02:17.800 
there's not little balls that are

00:02:17.800 --> 00:02:19.710 
there's not little balls that are
designed<00:02:18.070> for<00:02:18.160> like<00:02:18.370> real<00:02:18.760> baseball<00:02:18.940> bats<00:02:19.480> and

00:02:19.710 --> 00:02:19.720 
designed for like real baseball bats and

00:02:19.720 --> 00:02:20.880 
designed for like real baseball bats and
stuff<00:02:19.840> so<00:02:20.050> I<00:02:20.080> just<00:02:20.290> recommend<00:02:20.590> you<00:02:20.650> use<00:02:20.740> before

00:02:20.880 --> 00:02:20.890
