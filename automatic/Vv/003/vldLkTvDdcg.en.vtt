doesn't<00:01:37.560> seem<00:01:37.740> that<00:01:37.770> big<00:01:38.159> at<00:01:38.340> all<00:01:38.429> not<00:01:38.700> only

00:01:38.960 --> 00:01:38.970 
doesn't seem that big at all not only

00:01:38.970 --> 00:01:41.410 
doesn't seem that big at all not only
because<00:01:39.330> we<00:01:39.720> have<00:01:39.960> for<00:01:40.289> the<00:01:40.380> most<00:01:40.590> part<00:01:41.009> been

00:01:41.410 --> 00:01:41.420 
because we have for the most part been

00:01:41.420 --> 00:01:44.630 
because we have for the most part been
completely<00:01:42.420> desensitized<00:01:43.140> to<00:01:43.800> open-world

00:01:44.630 --> 00:01:44.640 
completely desensitized to open-world

00:01:44.640 --> 00:01:47.600 
completely desensitized to open-world
environment<00:01:44.849> I<00:01:45.539> mean<00:01:45.989> over<00:01:46.530> the<00:01:46.560> past<00:01:46.950> decade

00:01:47.600 --> 00:01:47.610 
environment I mean over the past decade

00:01:47.610 --> 00:01:49.820 
environment I mean over the past decade
or<00:01:47.640> so<00:01:47.789> there<00:01:48.450> have<00:01:48.720> been<00:01:48.750> a<00:01:48.929> ton<00:01:49.380> of<00:01:49.410> games

00:01:49.820 --> 00:01:49.830 
or so there have been a ton of games

00:01:49.830 --> 00:01:52.779 
or so there have been a ton of games
which<00:01:50.489> is<00:01:50.700> giant<00:01:51.239> sprawling<00:01:51.959> worlds<00:01:52.649> or

00:01:52.779 --> 00:01:52.789 
which is giant sprawling worlds or

00:01:52.789 --> 00:01:56.570 
which is giant sprawling worlds or
massive<00:01:53.789> sandbox<00:01:54.569> cities<00:01:55.110> to<00:01:55.349> explore<00:01:55.860> but

00:01:56.570 --> 00:01:56.580 
massive sandbox cities to explore but

00:01:56.580 --> 00:01:58.100 
massive sandbox cities to explore but
it's<00:01:56.729> not<00:01:56.879> just<00:01:57.060> because<00:01:57.390> of<00:01:57.420> that<00:01:57.569> it's<00:01:57.840> also

00:01:58.100 --> 00:01:58.110 
it's not just because of that it's also

00:01:58.110 --> 00:02:00.979 
it's not just because of that it's also
because<00:01:58.709> Mega<00:01:59.429> Man<00:01:59.700> Legends<00:02:00.179> just<00:02:00.569> doesn't

00:02:00.979 --> 00:02:00.989 
because Mega Man Legends just doesn't

00:02:00.989 --> 00:02:04.339 
because Mega Man Legends just doesn't
have<00:02:01.200> that<00:02:01.560> big<00:02:01.860> of<00:02:01.890> a<00:02:02.129> city<00:02:02.459> by<00:02:03.349> 2013

00:02:09.169 --> 00:02:09.179 
standards by 1997-1998 standards it was

00:02:09.179 --> 00:02:12.890

say

00:02:13.369 --> 00:02:13.379 
say

00:02:13.379 --> 00:02:15.290

I<00:02:13.410> mean<00:02:13.860> before<00:02:14.069> Mega<00:02:14.489> Man<00:02:14.700> Legends<00:02:15.090> there

00:02:15.290 --> 00:02:15.300 
I mean before Mega Man Legends there

00:02:15.300 --> 00:02:18.890 
I mean before Mega Man Legends there
were<00:02:15.480> plenty<00:02:15.959> of<00:02:16.489> 2d<00:02:17.489> RPG<00:02:17.790> something<00:02:18.720> like
