important as you should opening up here
we<00:02:04.710> have<00:02:04.860> the<00:02:05.009> interior<00:02:05.490> can<00:02:05.939> even<00:02:06.210> a<00:02:06.329> weird<00:02:07.049> or

00:02:07.280 --> 00:02:07.290 
we have the interior can even a weird or

00:02:07.290 --> 00:02:09.650 
we have the interior can even a weird or
for<00:02:07.770> the<00:02:07.860> dist<00:02:08.129> just<00:02:08.640> having<00:02:08.910> the<00:02:09.030> mouth<00:02:09.270> in

00:02:09.650 --> 00:02:09.660 
for the dist just having the mouth in

00:02:09.660 --> 00:02:11.869 
for the dist just having the mouth in
the<00:02:09.720> middle<00:02:10.050> like<00:02:10.170> that<00:02:10.200> with<00:02:10.619> a<00:02:10.649> big<00:02:11.610> gaping

00:02:11.869 --> 00:02:11.879 
the middle like that with a big gaping

00:02:11.879 --> 00:02:13.220 
the middle like that with a big gaping
hole<00:02:12.360> but

00:02:13.220 --> 00:02:13.230 
hole but

00:02:13.230 --> 00:02:15.110 
hole but
and<00:02:13.409> what<00:02:13.800> to<00:02:13.920> say<00:02:14.099> taking<00:02:14.670> away<00:02:14.790> the<00:02:14.849> disk

00:02:15.110 --> 00:02:15.120 
and what to say taking away the disk

00:02:15.120 --> 00:02:17.420 
and what to say taking away the disk
that<00:02:15.629> is<00:02:15.690> what<00:02:16.140> the<00:02:16.290> interior<00:02:16.800> or<00:02:17.010> quark<00:02:17.220> looks

00:02:17.420 --> 00:02:17.430 
that is what the interior or quark looks

00:02:17.430 --> 00:02:21.680 
that is what the interior or quark looks
like<00:02:18.590> that's<00:02:19.590> exactly<00:02:20.250> the<00:02:20.430> same<00:02:20.700> as<00:02:21.420> the

00:02:21.680 --> 00:02:21.690 
like that's exactly the same as the

00:02:21.690 --> 00:02:24.920 
like that's exactly the same as the
backyard<00:02:22.080> so<00:02:22.319> yeah<00:02:22.650> just<00:02:23.370> realized<00:02:23.879> that<00:02:24.239> it's

00:02:24.920 --> 00:02:24.930 
backyard so yeah just realized that it's

00:02:24.930 --> 00:02:27.920 
backyard so yeah just realized that it's
actually<00:02:25.290> a<00:02:25.349> reversible<00:02:26.190> cover<00:02:26.519> but<00:02:26.930> the

00:02:27.920 --> 00:02:27.930 
actually a reversible cover but the

00:02:27.930 --> 00:02:30.530 
actually a reversible cover but the
ginormous<00:02:28.860> Lee<00:02:29.489> interesting<00:02:29.940> question<00:02:30.390> is

00:02:30.530 --> 00:02:30.540 
ginormous Lee interesting question is

00:02:30.540 --> 00:02:33.320 
ginormous Lee interesting question is
why<00:02:30.810> the<00:02:30.870> hell<00:02:31.170> did<00:02:31.440> they<00:02:31.560> make<00:02:31.769> a<00:02:32.330> reversible

00:02:33.320 --> 00:02:33.330 
why the hell did they make a reversible

00:02:33.330 --> 00:02:37.539 
why the hell did they make a reversible
cover<00:02:34.580> which<00:02:35.580> is<00:02:35.790> essentially<00:02:36.450> identical

00:02:37.539 --> 00:02:37.549 
cover which is essentially identical

00:02:37.549 --> 00:02:40.369 
cover which is essentially identical
yeah<00:02:38.549> maybe<00:02:39.060> you<00:02:39.329> can<00:02:39.540> just<00:02:39.690> you<00:02:40.049> know<00:02:40.079> take

00:02:40.369 --> 00:02:40.379 
yeah maybe you can just you know take

00:02:40.379 --> 00:02:42.020 
yeah maybe you can just you know take
some<00:02:40.560> time<00:02:40.799> to<00:02:41.040> spot<00:02:41.340> the<00:02:41.489> differences<00:02:41.879> but

00:02:42.020 --> 00:02:42.030 
some time to spot the differences but

00:02:42.030 --> 00:02:44.000 
some time to spot the differences but
the<00:02:42.120> only<00:02:42.269> thing<00:02:42.360> that<00:02:42.599> I<00:02:42.629> notice<00:02:43.290> is<00:02:43.500> that

00:02:44.000 --> 00:02:44.010 
the only thing that I notice is that

00:02:44.010 --> 00:02:47.240 
the only thing that I notice is that
I've<00:02:44.340> actually<00:02:44.519> removed<00:02:45.150> the<00:02:46.079> rating<00:02:46.470> logo<00:02:46.829> on

00:02:47.240 --> 00:02:47.250 
I've actually removed the rating logo on

00:02:47.250 --> 00:02:49.160 
I've actually removed the rating logo on
this<00:02:47.549> one<00:02:47.760> never<00:02:48.510> seen<00:02:48.780> this<00:02:48.900> done<00:02:49.110> before

00:02:49.160 --> 00:02:49.170 
this one never seen this done before

00:02:49.170 --> 00:02:52.610 
this one never seen this done before
it's<00:02:49.650> just<00:02:50.629> and<00:02:51.629> I<00:02:51.720> figured<00:02:52.019> maybe<00:02:52.049> it<00:02:52.410> would

00:02:52.610 --> 00:02:52.620 
it's just and I figured maybe it would

00:02:52.620 --> 00:02:55.300 
it's just and I figured maybe it would
be<00:02:52.739> like<00:02:52.890> English<00:02:53.400> cover<00:02:53.670> or<00:02:53.879> something<00:02:54.209> but<00:02:54.390> a

00:02:55.300 --> 00:02:55.310 
be like English cover or something but a

00:02:55.310 --> 00:02:57.920 
be like English cover or something but a
gal<00:02:56.310> that's<00:02:56.489> just<00:02:56.819> really<00:02:56.970> reload<00:02:57.329> I<00:02:57.569> also

00:02:57.920 --> 00:02:57.930 
gal that's just really reload I also

00:02:57.930 --> 00:03:00.020 
gal that's just really reload I also
included<00:02:58.530> here<00:02:58.799> in<00:02:59.220> the<00:02:59.310> key<00:02:59.489> case<00:02:59.760> is

00:03:00.020 --> 00:03:00.030 
included here in the key case is

00:03:00.030 --> 00:03:02.930 
included here in the key case is
actually<00:03:00.480> one<00:03:01.079> of<00:03:01.109> these<00:03:01.370> protective<00:03:02.370> masks

00:03:02.930 --> 00:03:02.940 
actually one of these protective masks

00:03:02.940 --> 00:03:05.890 
actually one of these protective masks
it<00:03:03.900> is<00:03:04.079> actually<00:03:04.230> a<00:03:04.440> real<00:03:04.769> sort<00:03:05.190> of

00:03:05.890 --> 00:03:05.900 
it is actually a real sort of

00:03:05.900 --> 00:03:08.780 
it is actually a real sort of
mouth-breathing<00:03:07.129> protection<00:03:08.129> thingy<00:03:08.370> so

00:03:08.780 --> 00:03:08.790 
mouth-breathing protection thingy so

00:03:08.790 --> 00:03:12.530 
mouth-breathing protection thingy so
yeah<00:03:09.120> anyway<00:03:09.810> here<00:03:10.440> is<00:03:10.680> the<00:03:11.340> second<00:03:12.269> film

00:03:12.530 --> 00:03:12.540 
yeah anyway here is the second film

00:03:12.540 --> 00:03:15.020 
yeah anyway here is the second film
which<00:03:13.200> is<00:03:13.410> actually<00:03:13.560> a<00:03:13.739> documentary<00:03:14.370> from<00:03:14.579> the

00:03:15.020 --> 00:03:15.030 
which is actually a documentary from the

00:03:15.030 --> 00:03:17.569 
which is actually a documentary from the
discovery<00:03:15.480> channel<00:03:15.560> like<00:03:16.560> searching<00:03:16.980> in<00:03:17.459> the

00:03:17.569 --> 00:03:17.579 
discovery channel like searching in the

00:03:17.579 --> 00:03:22.159 
discovery channel like searching in the
21st<00:03:18.480> century<00:03:19.639> I<00:03:20.639> know<00:03:21.299> maybe<00:03:21.660> this<00:03:21.870> is<00:03:22.019> not

00:03:22.159 --> 00:03:22.169 
21st century I know maybe this is not

00:03:22.169 --> 00:03:23.690 
21st century I know maybe this is not
searching<00:03:22.769> but<00:03:22.889> I<00:03:22.919> think<00:03:23.160> your<00:03:23.250> app<00:03:23.400> whatever

00:03:23.690 --> 00:03:23.700 
searching but I think your app whatever

00:03:23.700 --> 00:03:25.759 
searching but I think your app whatever
 it<00:03:24.060> just<00:03:24.389> look<00:03:24.900> this<00:03:25.079> up<00:03:25.200> online<00:03:25.380> i'm

00:03:31.759 --> 00:03:31.769 
whereas carriers was just a one disc

00:03:31.769 --> 00:03:36.349 
whereas carriers was just a one disc
closer<00:03:32.280> look<00:03:32.519> at<00:03:32.639> the<00:03:32.760> discs<00:03:33.150> so<00:03:35.090> just<00:03:36.090> wanting

00:03:42.409 --> 00:03:42.419 
also just a close-up of the cover case

00:03:42.419 --> 00:03:43.849 
also just a close-up of the cover case
you<00:03:42.569> want<00:03:42.750> to<00:03:42.780> see<00:03:42.959> all<00:03:43.079> the<00:03:43.230> specs<00:03:43.590> and
