00:01:57.519 --> 00:01:57.529 
Bari and it lowers the damage if it's a

00:01:57.529 --> 00:02:03.129 
Bari and it lowers the damage if it's a
ice<00:01:58.249> type<00:01:58.520> move<00:01:58.729> and<00:01:59.889> yeah<00:02:00.889> so<00:02:01.539> that's<00:02:02.539> it<00:02:02.689> yeah

00:02:03.129 --> 00:02:03.139 
ice type move and yeah so that's it yeah

00:02:03.139 --> 00:02:05.649 
ice type move and yeah so that's it yeah
it<00:02:03.229> also<00:02:03.349> has<00:02:03.529> to<00:02:03.649> be

00:02:05.649 --> 00:02:05.659 
it also has to be

00:02:05.659 --> 00:02:08.509 
it also has to be
super<00:02:06.659> effective<00:02:07.109> if<00:02:07.920> it's<00:02:08.190> a<00:02:08.250> super

00:02:08.509 --> 00:02:08.519 
super effective if it's a super

00:02:08.519 --> 00:02:11.150 
super effective if it's a super
effective<00:02:08.789> ice<00:02:09.090> type<00:02:09.390> move<00:02:09.599> that<00:02:10.440> or<00:02:10.590> we<00:02:11.009> know

00:02:11.150 --> 00:02:11.160 
effective ice type move that or we know

00:02:11.160 --> 00:02:12.380 
effective ice type move that or we know
and<00:02:11.430> there's<00:02:11.640> other<00:02:11.760> berries<00:02:12.060> for<00:02:12.239> other

00:02:12.380 --> 00:02:12.390 
and there's other berries for other

00:02:12.390 --> 00:02:14.059 
and there's other berries for other
types<00:02:12.690> of<00:02:12.870> super<00:02:13.110> effective<00:02:13.349> hits<00:02:13.620> but<00:02:13.860> I

00:02:14.059 --> 00:02:14.069 
types of super effective hits but I

00:02:14.069 --> 00:02:16.430 
types of super effective hits but I
still<00:02:14.580> able<00:02:15.000> to<00:02:15.300> knock<00:02:15.450> out<00:02:15.629> Garchomp<00:02:16.200> and

00:02:16.430 --> 00:02:16.440 
still able to knock out Garchomp and

00:02:16.440 --> 00:02:19.400 
still able to knock out Garchomp and
then<00:02:16.769> I<00:02:16.830> send<00:02:17.190> in<00:02:17.310> magnezone<00:02:17.959> because<00:02:18.959> I'm

00:02:19.400 --> 00:02:19.410 
then I send in magnezone because I'm

00:02:19.410 --> 00:02:21.500 
then I send in magnezone because I'm
predicting<00:02:20.040> a<00:02:20.099> meteor<00:02:20.400> mash<00:02:20.610> and<00:02:20.970> they<00:02:21.120> do<00:02:21.180> use

00:02:21.500 --> 00:02:21.510 
predicting a meteor mash and they do use

00:02:21.510 --> 00:02:24.110 
predicting a meteor mash and they do use
it<00:02:21.560> you<00:02:22.560> get<00:02:22.709> a<00:02:22.739> critical<00:02:23.190> hit<00:02:23.310> but<00:02:23.580> it<00:02:23.849> really

00:02:24.110 --> 00:02:24.120 
it you get a critical hit but it really

00:02:24.120 --> 00:02:25.729 
it you get a critical hit but it really
does<00:02:24.299> not<00:02:24.480> do<00:02:24.660> very<00:02:24.690> much<00:02:25.019> damage<00:02:25.440> at<00:02:25.530> all<00:02:25.620> the

00:02:25.729 --> 00:02:25.739 
does not do very much damage at all the

00:02:25.739 --> 00:02:27.559 
does not do very much damage at all the
magazine<00:02:26.160> he<00:02:26.310> can<00:02:26.519> resist<00:02:27.180> things<00:02:27.360> pretty

00:02:27.559 --> 00:02:27.569 
magazine he can resist things pretty

00:02:27.569 --> 00:02:30.500 
magazine he can resist things pretty
well<00:02:27.629> and<00:02:28.049> so<00:02:28.950> I<00:02:28.980> go<00:02:29.190> for<00:02:29.580> a<00:02:29.610> thunderbolt

00:02:30.500 --> 00:02:30.510 
well and so I go for a thunderbolt

00:02:30.510 --> 00:02:31.670 
well and so I go for a thunderbolt
knowing<00:02:30.900> that<00:02:31.019> they're<00:02:31.170> going<00:02:31.260> to<00:02:31.349> use<00:02:31.440> hammer

00:02:31.670 --> 00:02:31.680 
knowing that they're going to use hammer

00:02:31.680 --> 00:02:33.320 
knowing that they're going to use hammer
arm<00:02:31.799> I<00:02:32.099> just<00:02:32.250> want<00:02:32.430> to<00:02:32.489> do<00:02:32.549> as<00:02:32.640> much<00:02:32.819> damage<00:02:32.849> as

00:02:33.320 --> 00:02:33.330 
arm I just want to do as much damage as

00:02:33.330 --> 00:02:35.750 
arm I just want to do as much damage as
i<00:02:33.450> can<00:02:33.660> to<00:02:33.959> maybe<00:02:34.590> lead<00:02:34.920> the<00:02:35.069> way<00:02:35.220> for<00:02:35.250> frost

00:02:35.750 --> 00:02:35.760 
i can to maybe lead the way for frost

00:02:35.760 --> 00:02:39.199 
i can to maybe lead the way for frost
last<00:02:36.000> to<00:02:36.540> victory<00:02:36.900> maybe<00:02:37.500> and<00:02:38.130> metagross<00:02:38.880> uses

00:02:39.199 --> 00:02:39.209 
last to victory maybe and metagross uses

00:02:39.209 --> 00:02:41.990 
last to victory maybe and metagross uses
hammer<00:02:39.510> arm<00:02:39.780> and<00:02:40.549> unfortunately<00:02:41.549> knocks<00:02:41.790> out

00:02:41.990 --> 00:02:42.000 
hammer arm and unfortunately knocks out

00:02:42.000 --> 00:02:42.920 
hammer arm and unfortunately knocks out
magnezone<00:02:42.390> i<00:02:42.420> thought<00:02:42.630> i<00:02:42.660> was<00:02:42.780> going<00:02:42.870> to

00:02:42.920 --> 00:02:42.930 
magnezone i thought i was going to

00:02:42.930 --> 00:02:44.210 
magnezone i thought i was going to
survive<00:02:43.200> because<00:02:43.410> the<00:02:43.590> HP<00:02:43.860> was<00:02:43.950> kind<00:02:44.099> of<00:02:44.130> going

00:02:44.210 --> 00:02:44.220 
survive because the HP was kind of going

00:02:44.220 --> 00:02:47.120 
survive because the HP was kind of going
down<00:02:44.489> slow<00:02:45.440> maybe<00:02:46.440> if<00:02:46.590> you<00:02:46.680> hadn't<00:02:46.890> gotten<00:02:47.010> the

00:02:47.120 --> 00:02:47.130 
down slow maybe if you hadn't gotten the

00:02:47.130 --> 00:02:49.520 
down slow maybe if you hadn't gotten the
critical<00:02:47.459> it<00:02:47.519> may<00:02:47.640> survive<00:02:48.000> but<00:02:48.390> yeah<00:02:49.079> maybe

00:02:49.520 --> 00:02:49.530 
critical it may survive but yeah maybe

00:02:49.530 --> 00:02:51.050 
critical it may survive but yeah maybe
maybe<00:02:49.860> not<00:02:50.250> you<00:02:50.519> know<00:02:50.610> there's<00:02:50.790> all<00:02:50.910> these

00:02:51.050 --> 00:02:51.060 
maybe not you know there's all these

00:02:51.060 --> 00:02:52.880 
maybe not you know there's all these
maybes<00:02:51.480> being<00:02:51.930> thrown<00:02:52.170> around<00:02:52.200> because<00:02:52.829> I

00:02:52.880 --> 00:02:52.890 
maybes being thrown around because I

00:02:52.890 --> 00:02:53.900 
maybes being thrown around because I
really<00:02:53.250> don't<00:02:53.400> know<00:02:53.519> what<00:02:53.700> would<00:02:53.819> have

you know kingdra maybe won't be able to
survive<00:03:21.180> to<00:03:21.450> Thunderbolt<00:03:21.900> so<00:03:22.139> go<00:03:22.739> for<00:03:22.950> a

00:03:22.970 --> 00:03:22.980

survive to Thunderbolt so go for a
thunderbolt<00:03:23.459> and<00:03:23.579> it<00:03:23.880> does<00:03:24.060> just<00:03:24.420> about<00:03:24.540> half

00:03:24.800 --> 00:03:24.810 
thunderbolt and it does just about half

00:03:24.810 --> 00:03:27.280 
thunderbolt and it does just about half
HP<00:03:25.079> because<00:03:25.590> I<00:03:25.620> have<00:03:25.920> a<00:03:26.160> choice<00:03:26.459> spect
