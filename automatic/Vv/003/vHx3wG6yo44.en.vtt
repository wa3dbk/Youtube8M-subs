00:02:00.119 --> 00:02:02.120 
that's why Sony probably disagreed
that's<00:02:00.719> why<00:02:00.930> the<00:02:00.990> deal<00:02:01.290> fell<00:02:01.560> apart<00:02:01.590> because

00:02:02.120 --> 00:02:02.130 
that's why the deal fell apart because

00:02:02.130 --> 00:02:04.730 
that's why the deal fell apart because
40<00:02:02.700> percents<00:02:03.210> weren't<00:02:03.450> enough<00:02:03.840> from<00:02:04.439> their

00:02:04.730 --> 00:02:04.740 
40 percents weren't enough from their

00:02:04.740 --> 00:02:06.720 
40 percents weren't enough from their
character<00:02:05.369> they<00:02:05.610> bring<00:02:05.820> only<00:02:05.969> one<00:02:06.329> here

00:02:06.720 --> 00:02:06.730 
character they bring only one here

00:02:06.730 --> 00:02:08.970 
character they bring only one here
and<00:02:07.000> they<00:02:07.090> get<00:02:07.300> 40<00:02:07.660> percents<00:02:08.170> from<00:02:08.410> spider-man

00:02:08.970 --> 00:02:08.980 
and they get 40 percents from spider-man

00:02:08.980 --> 00:02:10.920 
and they get 40 percents from spider-man
and<00:02:09.250> markets<00:02:09.790> of<00:02:10.030> course<00:02:10.060> the<00:02:10.450> bigger<00:02:10.720> piece

00:02:10.920 --> 00:02:10.930 
and markets of course the bigger piece

00:02:10.930 --> 00:02:13.560 
and markets of course the bigger piece
of<00:02:10.960> pie<00:02:11.350> which<00:02:11.620> is<00:02:11.650> 60%<00:02:12.300> probably<00:02:13.300> that's<00:02:13.450> the

00:02:13.560 --> 00:02:13.570 
of pie which is 60% probably that's the

00:02:13.570 --> 00:02:15.720 
of pie which is 60% probably that's the
reason<00:02:13.930> the<00:02:14.020> deal<00:02:14.170> fell<00:02:14.440> apart<00:02:14.470> but<00:02:15.400> then

00:02:15.720 --> 00:02:15.730 
reason the deal fell apart but then

00:02:15.730 --> 00:02:17.730 
reason the deal fell apart but then
again<00:02:16.000> if<00:02:16.390> you<00:02:16.480> think<00:02:16.720> about<00:02:16.810> it<00:02:17.110> if<00:02:17.290> this<00:02:17.500> deal

00:02:17.730 --> 00:02:17.740 
again if you think about it if this deal

00:02:17.740 --> 00:02:18.720 
again if you think about it if this deal
will<00:02:17.950> still<00:02:18.220> happen

00:02:18.720 --> 00:02:18.730 
will still happen

00:02:18.730 --> 00:02:20.910 
will still happen
spider-man<00:02:19.180> won't<00:02:19.540> only<00:02:19.810> appear<00:02:20.350> in<00:02:20.560> Captain

00:02:20.910 --> 00:02:20.920 
spider-man won't only appear in Captain

00:02:20.920 --> 00:02:22.740 
spider-man won't only appear in Captain
America<00:02:20.980> Civil<00:02:21.640> War<00:02:21.850> he<00:02:22.420> will<00:02:22.510> probably

00:02:22.740 --> 00:02:22.750 
America Civil War he will probably

00:02:22.750 --> 00:02:24.870 
America Civil War he will probably
appear<00:02:23.140> as<00:02:23.290> a<00:02:23.320> guest<00:02:23.650> or<00:02:23.950> have<00:02:24.310> a<00:02:24.340> bigger<00:02:24.700> role

00:02:24.870 --> 00:02:24.880 
appear as a guest or have a bigger role

00:02:24.880 --> 00:02:26.700 
appear as a guest or have a bigger role

in all the future Marvel Cinematic

00:02:26.710 --> 00:02:28.620 
in all the future Marvel Cinematic

that collaborating with Marvel is the

00:03:37.300 --> 00:03:40.050 
that collaborating with Marvel is the

like the best case scenario for Sony
not<00:03:43.300> for<00:03:43.540> Mara<00:03:43.810> Mara<00:03:44.140> really<00:03:44.410> can't<00:03:44.830> do
