Getting together with the girls to chat about style, fashion, beauty and many other topics

00:00:15.279 --> 00:00:19.140
of interest to women can be very relaxing and fun

00:00:19.140 --> 00:00:21.710
especially when it comes to sharing tricks 

00:00:21.710 --> 00:00:24.289
on how to look more attractive and sexy.

00:00:24.890 --> 00:00:29.550
Today it's our turn. 

00:00:29.550 --> 00:00:34.040
Mariela is a close friend of mine and an amazing makeup artist

00:00:33.040 --> 00:00:40.040
And as you know, my topic is style and image consultancy. So let's get started and talk about how to achieve a sexy and attractive look.

00:00:40.100 --> 00:00:48.100
Dressing sexy does not necessarily mean you have to show everything (you know what I mean)

00:00:48.220 --> 00:00:55.220
The most important thing is that your outfit should perfectly fit your body type and highlight your figure.

00:00:55.810 --> 00:01:05.810
For this occasion, and based on my body type, I picked out a short and snug-fitting dress with a plunging neckline and long sleeves

00:01:05.390 --> 00:01:11.390
With such a pronounced V-neck, there is no need to reveal the shoulders and arms

00:01:11.880 --> 00:01:17.880
However, details like shoulder pads and sequined sleeves help to set off my figure

00:01:17.120 --> 00:01:23.120
Finally, I chose a pair of slightly funky heeled sandals to add a splash of fun to my look

00:01:23.510 --> 00:01:28.769
It is important to complement my outfit with the right makeup and hairstyle

00:01:28.769 --> 00:01:34.030
In this case, I go for a more natural makeup, but really play up my lips by applying red lipstick and sealing with a shiny gloss

00:01:34.030 --> 00:01:45.030
As you know, there's nothing sexier than red lips. I brush on a little blush, and that's it.

00:01:45.400 --> 00:01:50.400
As for my hair, I decide to leave it loose and a little bit 

00:01:50.849 --> 00:02:00.849
For this look, I spray a hair volumizer on the ends and slowly massage and fluff out to create volume, until I achieve the desired look.

00:02:00.879 --> 00:02:06.610
An asymmetric cut dress will always be a super sexy option

00:02:06.610 --> 00:02:16.349
To keep it from seeming too formal, we'll add some informal accessories, like these ankle boots that help to add a more casual but very chic touch

00:02:16.349 --> 00:02:26.080
For my evening makeup, I want my eyes to stand out and opt for the smoky eyes effect with various shades of brown. I complement my look with a lip gloss in a neutral tone

00:02:26.080 --> 00:02:37.140
In this case, I'm going to make use of the one shoulder dress I'm wearing to create a false bob on the side with the bare shoulder.

00:02:37.080 --> 00:02:56.140
I start by using my hands to tease the ends and build up volume. Then I loosely gather up and tuck my hair under with the help of bobby pins, to create a fake haircut in a bob style. This is a very sexy look reminiscent of the fifties that you can pull off without having to use scissors

00:02:56.080 --> 00:03:00.140
Remember, feeling and looking sexy is all about your attitude.

00:03:00.080 --> 00:03:06.140
