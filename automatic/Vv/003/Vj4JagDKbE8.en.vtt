pocket by accident caused by forgetting

00:03:08.510 --> 00:03:11.530 
pocket by accident caused by forgetting
so<00:03:09.440> but<00:03:09.830> you<00:03:10.459> thinks<00:03:10.730> it's<00:03:10.790> a<00:03:10.940> disadvantage

00:03:11.530 --> 00:03:11.540 
so but you thinks it's a disadvantage

00:03:11.540 --> 00:03:13.810 
so but you thinks it's a disadvantage
it's<00:03:11.989> not<00:03:12.200> you<00:03:12.709> can<00:03:12.860> easily<00:03:13.220> slide<00:03:13.489> your

00:03:13.810 --> 00:03:13.820 
it's not you can easily slide your

00:03:13.820 --> 00:03:17.729 
it's not you can easily slide your
finger<00:03:14.500> and<00:03:15.500> easily<00:03:15.890> slide<00:03:16.100> your<00:03:16.310> finger<00:03:16.610> up

00:03:17.729 --> 00:03:17.739 
finger and easily slide your finger up

00:03:17.739 --> 00:03:22.270 
finger and easily slide your finger up
it's<00:03:18.739> a<00:03:18.860> very<00:03:18.890> nice<00:03:19.280> smooth<00:03:19.880> feel<00:03:20.590> so<00:03:21.590> I<00:03:21.860> think

00:03:22.270 --> 00:03:22.280 
it's a very nice smooth feel so I think

00:03:22.280 --> 00:03:27.390 
it's a very nice smooth feel so I think
it<00:03:22.550> was<00:03:22.640> kind<00:03:22.850> of<00:03:22.940> smart<00:03:23.390> it's<00:03:23.750> a<00:03:23.870> slanted

00:03:27.390 --> 00:03:27.400 

00:03:27.400 --> 00:03:30.610 

slant<00:03:28.400> it<00:03:28.580> so<00:03:28.820> you<00:03:28.880> can<00:03:29.120> easily<00:03:30.050> move<00:03:30.440> your

00:03:30.610 --> 00:03:30.620 
slant it so you can easily move your

00:03:30.620 --> 00:03:33.490 
slant it so you can easily move your
finger<00:03:31.070> very<00:03:31.280> nice<00:03:31.970> you<00:03:32.780> have<00:03:32.989> the<00:03:33.290> raised

00:03:33.490 --> 00:03:33.500 
finger very nice you have the raised

00:03:33.500 --> 00:03:36.250 
finger very nice you have the raised
edges<00:03:33.860> but<00:03:34.519> you<00:03:34.670> do<00:03:34.760> the<00:03:34.880> same<00:03:34.910> thing<00:03:35.360> they

00:03:36.250 --> 00:03:36.260 
edges but you do the same thing they

00:03:36.260 --> 00:03:40.780 
edges but you do the same thing they
don't<00:03:36.470> hit<00:03:36.739> the<00:03:37.130> screen<00:03:37.870> that<00:03:38.870> well<00:03:39.790> but

00:03:40.780 --> 00:03:40.790 
don't hit the screen that well but

00:03:40.790 --> 00:03:42.490 
don't hit the screen that well but
that's<00:03:41.030> also<00:03:41.330> not<00:03:41.510> bad<00:03:41.870> because<00:03:42.110> it<00:03:42.320> makes

00:03:42.490 --> 00:03:42.500 
that's also not bad because it makes

00:03:42.500 --> 00:03:45.040 
that's also not bad because it makes
touching<00:03:43.100> it<00:03:43.480> sliding<00:03:44.480> back<00:03:44.630> and<00:03:44.660> forth<00:03:44.780> Pro
