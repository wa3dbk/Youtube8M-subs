00:00:03.120 --> 00:00:06.770
 They want to show off a younger face, good, well, to tell us how we can 

00:00:06.770 --> 00:00:11.130
 Dr. José Raúl Montes rentería good morning with 

00:00:11.130 --> 00:00:11.539
 she 

00:00:11.539 --> 00:00:14.469
 tell me sherry 

00:00:14.469 --> 00:00:16.970
 sculpture as the word says 

00:00:16.970 --> 00:00:18.900
 comes from sculpting 

00:00:18.900 --> 00:00:20.640
 already a material 

00:00:20.640 --> 00:00:23.640
 that are used to let's say sculpt the 

00:00:24.619 --> 00:00:27.829
 it works like a brake like a reef 

00:00:27.829 --> 00:00:30.789
 but it's not stuffed in the sense that it's something 

00:00:30.789 --> 00:00:35.460
 more sophisticated with more versatility is a material that we inject 

00:00:36.039 --> 00:00:37.850
 the arian of the face 

00:00:37.850 --> 00:00:39.720
 and this material 

00:00:39.720 --> 00:00:45.440
 that the patient himself produces his own material ie collagen for 

00:00:45.440 --> 00:00:47.600
 reset to restore 

00:00:47.600 --> 00:00:49.950
 arias where this material has been lost 

00:00:49.950 --> 00:00:52.520
 that is, defenses of other products 

00:00:52.520 --> 00:00:56.600
 this product is not injecting help to the person until creating 

00:00:58.200 --> 00:00:59.339
 that's right 

00:00:59.339 --> 00:01:03.840
 we grow old or lose youth with the face begins to score 

00:01:03.840 --> 00:01:07.800
 signs of fatigue because structure is lost that is hard fun like 

00:01:07.800 --> 00:01:12.550
 soft tissue bone like in fat or muscle and this is injected into 

00:01:12.550 --> 00:01:14.020
 different levels in said 

00:01:14.020 --> 00:01:16.020
 you paint layers on your face 

00:01:16.020 --> 00:01:22.260
 to restore those tissues to give support structure to the skin to scratch and 

00:01:22.260 --> 00:01:26.350
 then they notice some difference as they need this 

00:01:26.350 --> 00:01:28.480
 general something local 

00:01:28.480 --> 00:01:33.060
 it is painful first of all the sculptor the material that must be injected by 

00:01:33.060 --> 00:01:34.920
 a doctor highly 

00:01:34.920 --> 00:01:38.720
 trainer in the product and with a lot of experience in injectable watered 

00:01:38.720 --> 00:01:40.210
 facial expiration 

00:01:40.210 --> 00:01:43.979
 for this the company was very responsible in that this material 

00:01:43.979 --> 00:01:48.479
 amply make it accessible to doctors who are highly trained in 

00:01:48.479 --> 00:01:51.890
 patient well to the office and with local anesthesia what is to say with 

00:01:51.890 --> 00:01:54.550
 this one without cream on the face is injected 

00:01:54.550 --> 00:01:56.539
 yes we are seeing it on the screen 

00:01:56.539 --> 00:02:01.079
 90 or company of lagoon and tuzsa does not get nervous but it should not be very 

00:02:01.079 --> 00:02:06.519
 the patient is not painful once and the anesthesia material is placed 

00:02:06.519 --> 00:02:07.580
 cream on the face 

00:02:07.580 --> 00:02:10.479
 the conselleria is left for a period of time 

00:02:10.479 --> 00:02:15.499
 and really very comfortable injecting the patient basically 

00:02:15.499 --> 00:02:19.129
 Per hundred do not feel pain world that feels a small annoyance diamente 

00:02:19.129 --> 00:02:22.879
 he knows that he is being injected and injected in all the areas on his face 

00:02:22.879 --> 00:02:28.849
 where you need to reestablish the ovo lumen tissue that was approached that how much in 

00:02:28.849 --> 00:02:30.529
 how long do not see results 

00:02:30.529 --> 00:02:35.509
 very well this material is injected possessions is generally recommended 

00:02:35.509 --> 00:02:38.369
 that once injected the first time 

00:02:38.369 --> 00:02:41.239
 one re-evaluated the patient after one month 

00:02:41.239 --> 00:02:43.269
 in that month 

00:02:43.269 --> 00:02:46.589
 usually injected a second time 

00:02:46.589 --> 00:02:47.970
 appointment to the patient 

00:02:47.970 --> 00:02:50.989
 in four or six weeks free income 

00:02:50.989 --> 00:02:52.079
 exact 

00:02:52.079 --> 00:02:54.599
 because the magic of this 

00:02:54.599 --> 00:02:57.579
 the ideal of this product that is little by little 

00:02:57.579 --> 00:03:01.620
 of the patient is improving, all the structures of the 

00:03:01.619 --> 00:03:03.049
 face 

00:03:03.049 --> 00:03:06.840
 everyone will notice that it looks much better and nobody knows why it is not a 

00:03:06.839 --> 00:03:07.969
 immediate change 

00:03:07.969 --> 00:03:11.150
 not on the other hand the gradualness that is what it does 

00:03:11.150 --> 00:03:13.289
 of this product 

00:03:13.289 --> 00:03:17.119
 unique which the biggest difference is where it comes in between this product and 

00:03:17.119 --> 00:03:18.859
 other products what you have worked 

00:03:18.859 --> 00:03:21.909
 good if we are going to compare this product with the other films 

00:03:21.909 --> 00:03:26.180
 and all that are fb adapted to children that are all good products you 

00:03:26.180 --> 00:03:27.369
 high quality 

00:03:27.369 --> 00:03:31.539
 we have to listen to what a child provides something is that 

00:03:31.539 --> 00:03:36.079
 basically it is a material that can be used in all types of patients of the 

00:03:36.079 --> 00:03:37.249
 young patient 

00:03:37.249 --> 00:03:41.319
 already begins to notice the small changes that are already losing someone else 

00:03:41.319 --> 00:03:42.050
 side other 

00:03:42.050 --> 00:03:46.190
 ap the oldest patient who already has highly signs 

00:03:46.809 --> 00:03:49.049
 the aging marker 

00:03:49.049 --> 00:03:50.469
 very good, well, it has 

00:03:50.469 --> 00:03:54.450
 the killing was the durability zone of a life when it arrived and loneliness by 

00:03:54.449 --> 00:03:58.099
 the one that is once does not achieve the desired effect lasts 

00:03:58.099 --> 00:04:00.330
 almost two to three years under 

00:04:00.330 --> 00:04:03.599
 what adriana great difference that is the difference good yes
