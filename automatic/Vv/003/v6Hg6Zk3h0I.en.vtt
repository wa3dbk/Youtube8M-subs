00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.549
 at the top of the new tablet range 

00:00:02.970 --> 00:00:08.280
 asus android is definitely we find 

00:00:05.549 --> 00:00:11.240
 in a new face hawk corner that the 

00:00:08.280 --> 00:00:11.240
 product that 

00:00:11.400 --> 00:00:15.690
 evolves and sometimes we say the concept 

00:00:13.049 --> 00:00:17.939
 original of transformers has therefore of 

00:00:15.690 --> 00:00:20.189
 modular tablet with docking keyboard 

00:00:17.939 --> 00:00:22.800
 which integrates an additional battery a 

00:00:20.189 --> 00:00:25.980
 product that in this case becomes 

00:00:22.800 --> 00:00:27.480
 even more exceptional starting from 

00:00:25.980 --> 00:00:32.780
 screen let's talk about a resolution 

00:00:27.480 --> 00:00:34.079
 ultra hd 2560 x 1600 pixels 

00:00:32.780 --> 00:00:36.749
 really 

00:00:34.079 --> 00:00:40.409
 exceptional to enjoy let's say up in 

00:00:36.749 --> 00:00:44.659
 fund of multimedia contents and one 

00:00:40.409 --> 00:00:44.659
 resolution that is actually rewarding for 

00:00:45.710 --> 00:00:50.210
 also in this case the audio technology 

00:00:48.170 --> 00:00:52.000
 follows closely 

00:00:50.210 --> 00:00:54.060
 from the video 

00:00:52.000 --> 00:00:55.890
 sonicmaster technology 

00:00:54.060 --> 00:00:57.490
 developed from the collaboration with bang 

00:00:55.890 --> 00:01:00.700
 olufsen 

00:00:57.490 --> 00:01:03.520
 you know he boasts let's say a platform 

00:01:00.700 --> 00:01:04.570
 extremely rich hardware but 

00:01:03.520 --> 00:01:07.230
 especially also extremely 

00:01:04.570 --> 00:01:10.470
 performance in this case we speak 

00:01:07.230 --> 00:01:13.080
 the quad core tegra 3 4 processor that 

00:01:10.470 --> 00:01:17.310
 more than doubles the performance and the 

00:01:13.080 --> 00:01:19.140
 previous generation with as many as 72 shapes 

00:01:17.310 --> 00:01:20.340
 graphs therefore able to manage 

00:01:19.140 --> 00:01:22.710
 admirably not just one 

00:01:20.340 --> 00:01:25.560
 resolution so high but above all 

00:01:22.710 --> 00:01:29.050
 also impeccably even 

00:01:25.560 --> 00:01:32.650
 more demanding applications such as 

00:01:29.050 --> 00:01:32.650
 obviously the 

00:01:32.750 --> 00:01:35.390
 station of this product is 

00:01:33.980 --> 00:01:36.050
 particularly rich from the 

00:01:35.390 --> 00:01:38.230
 materials 

00:01:36.050 --> 00:01:41.690
 aluminum with a process 

00:01:38.230 --> 00:01:44.900
 particularly valuable in the cover 

00:01:41.690 --> 00:01:46.610
 autonomy and decidedly important yes 

00:01:44.900 --> 00:01:49.760
 they reach the 13 hours they become 

00:01:46.610 --> 00:01:51.950
 even 17 thanks to the addition of 

00:01:49.760 --> 00:01:54.390
 docking keyboard plus keyboard 

00:01:51.950 --> 00:01:57.260
 docking as well as 

00:01:54.390 --> 00:02:00.140
 the match of a physical keyboard 

00:01:57.260 --> 00:02:02.980
 which on the tablet also offers the 

00:02:00.140 --> 00:02:05.380
 presence of 

00:02:02.980 --> 00:02:07.930
 these input which in the case of the new 

00:02:05.380 --> 00:02:08.910
 transformer pad is also updated on 

00:02:07.930 --> 00:02:11.090
 generation 

00:02:08.910 --> 00:02:13.540
 according to three competitors 

00:02:11.090 --> 00:02:13.540
 reopen 

00:02:16.110 --> 00:02:21.160
 from who 

00:02:18.190 --> 00:02:23.310
 now more than someone 

00:02:21.160 --> 00:02:23.310
