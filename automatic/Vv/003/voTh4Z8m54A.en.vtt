00:01:57.950 --> 00:01:57.960 
mixing bowl here I'm going to add my

00:01:57.960 --> 00:02:02.330 
mixing bowl here I'm going to add my
sugar<00:01:59.689> vegetable<00:02:00.689> oil<00:02:00.899> a<00:02:01.320> little<00:02:01.770> bit<00:02:01.950> of<00:02:02.040> oil

00:02:02.330 --> 00:02:02.340 
sugar vegetable oil a little bit of oil

00:02:02.340 --> 00:02:04.850 
sugar vegetable oil a little bit of oil
adds<00:02:02.790> moisture<00:02:03.540> and<00:02:04.200> it<00:02:04.320> keeps<00:02:04.530> it<00:02:04.619> really

00:02:04.850 --> 00:02:04.860 
adds moisture and it keeps it really

00:02:04.860 --> 00:02:06.649 
adds moisture and it keeps it really
light<00:02:05.159> but<00:02:05.520> the<00:02:05.670> butter<00:02:05.969> gives<00:02:06.270> it<00:02:06.360> a<00:02:06.450> lot<00:02:06.600> of

00:02:06.649 --> 00:02:06.659 
light but the butter gives it a lot of

00:02:06.659 --> 00:02:07.850 
light but the butter gives it a lot of
flavor<00:02:06.869> so<00:02:07.140> that's<00:02:07.439> why<00:02:07.560> there's<00:02:07.740> a<00:02:07.770> little

00:02:07.850 --> 00:02:07.860 
flavor so that's why there's a little

00:02:07.860 --> 00:02:08.449 
flavor so that's why there's a little
bit<00:02:08.069> of<00:02:08.129> oil

00:02:08.449 --> 00:02:08.459
