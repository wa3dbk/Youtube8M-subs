00:00:02.300 --> 00:00:04.330
 Yes 

00:00:13.200 --> 00:00:20.230
 cauchon 

00:00:15.560 --> 00:00:20.230
 and note that suite in the bath 

00:00:30.070 --> 00:00:33.860
 like everyone else I have my sides 

00:00:32.239 --> 00:00:35.570
 dark who take me as a point 

00:00:33.860 --> 00:00:38.450
 aside as comes the sudden envy of 

00:00:35.570 --> 00:00:40.309
 boycott people I write a text with the 

00:00:38.450 --> 00:00:42.920
 the simpler the stones and words 

00:00:40.309 --> 00:00:44.840
 healthy by being the most to say them more 

00:00:42.920 --> 00:00:46.489
 except that it's the foot when I 

00:00:44.840 --> 00:00:48.860
 merges with my rap I become worse 

00:00:46.489 --> 00:00:51.320
 that jet because that is what a 

00:00:48.860 --> 00:00:53.900
 sky time and if you try out mate 

00:00:51.320 --> 00:00:56.540
 now you know what my name is 

00:00:53.900 --> 00:00:57.440
 and my hearts hip hop but 

00:00:56.540 --> 00:01:00.020
 proscribed 

00:00:57.440 --> 00:01:01.730
 since the time I'm in it's 

00:01:00.020 --> 00:01:04.400
 as if I kill her she tends every text 

00:01:01.730 --> 00:01:06.320
 writing time I am in perfect osmosis 

00:01:04.400 --> 00:01:08.780
 with my rap but who knows what makes 

00:01:06.320 --> 00:01:10.580
 the power of mount cosmos ever to the 

00:01:08.780 --> 00:01:12.230
 always on the rise always there 

00:01:10.580 --> 00:01:14.990
 head high ready to do what I have to 

00:01:12.230 --> 00:01:17.410
 to do and nothing else the most beautiful game 

00:01:14.990 --> 00:01:17.410
 vid that 

00:01:18.800 --> 00:01:23.930
 every day every night i wonder 

00:01:21.680 --> 00:01:24.560
 what would my life be without rap throwing in 

00:01:23.930 --> 00:01:27.620
 the void 

00:01:24.560 --> 00:01:29.630
 I really like the lowest level but 

00:01:27.620 --> 00:01:32.539
 what a street hole 

00:01:29.630 --> 00:01:38.000
 I love what they look at 

00:01:32.539 --> 00:01:39.649
 kill his daughter in crossed legs that a 

00:01:38.000 --> 00:01:41.280
 week I am but has in 

00:01:39.649 --> 00:01:43.170
 public opinion 

00:01:41.280 --> 00:01:45.479
 people who live and despair as 

00:01:43.170 --> 00:01:47.520
 dude now you know it's the rap that 

00:01:45.479 --> 00:01:49.290
 door that pushes me to bear the 

00:01:47.520 --> 00:01:51.810
 costs that are borne on media of 

00:01:49.290 --> 00:01:53.970
 all of a reason for that alone in front of my 

00:01:51.810 --> 00:01:57.330
 white sheet meditate tells me that I 

00:01:53.970 --> 00:01:59.520
 so that's what rap is an art a 

00:01:57.330 --> 00:02:02.009
 fight a perfect balcony you will fall 

00:01:59.520 --> 00:02:03.600
 not drunk by their own policies 

00:02:02.009 --> 00:02:05.190
 bloody have dropped their arms under 

00:02:03.600 --> 00:02:08.459
 the illusion effect of the phoenix the 

00:02:05.190 --> 00:02:09.780
 power is nothing without control and 

00:02:08.459 --> 00:02:10.970
 even that's well said what you master 

00:02:09.780 --> 00:02:13.040
 I do not have 

00:02:10.970 --> 00:02:14.990
 the cosmos is acquired over time 

00:02:13.040 --> 00:02:17.450
 worried I stay hip hop the same if 

00:02:14.990 --> 00:02:19.250
 in my head is the brothel that a 

00:02:17.450 --> 00:02:21.510
 every bad text or bad note I 

00:02:19.250 --> 00:02:24.510
 spits the music gets out of her 

00:02:21.510 --> 00:02:26.280
 bochum cosmos plus I repeat this 

00:02:24.510 --> 00:02:28.379
 sentence I feel deadly sweater in 

00:02:26.280 --> 00:02:30.569
 knight of liban abl of mob and elected 

00:02:28.379 --> 00:02:33.239
 on sheets of scratch paper 

00:02:30.569 --> 00:02:35.670
 sixteen steps to each other and trip banquets 

00:02:33.239 --> 00:02:41.060
 hop it's hard and 6 2 and 6 1 and this is 

00:02:35.670 --> 00:02:41.060
 that now I know when you know 

00:02:41.209 --> 00:02:48.120
 everything I have in which all that 

00:02:43.650 --> 00:02:52.660
 I have in the background what is football 

00:02:48.120 --> 00:02:54.190

00:02:52.660 --> 00:02:55.780
 every day 

00:02:54.190 --> 00:02:58.030
 every minute every I wonder 

00:02:55.780 --> 00:02:58.480

00:02:58.030 --> 00:03:01.810

00:02:58.480 --> 00:03:03.630

00:03:07.830 --> 00:03:12.260

00:03:18.060 --> 00:03:21.960

00:03:19.080 --> 00:03:24.840

00:03:21.960 --> 00:03:27.330
