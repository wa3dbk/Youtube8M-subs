 Giant shrimp called king brown 

00:00:41.880 --> 00:00:46.170

00:00:43.500 --> 00:00:47.879

00:01:03.059 --> 00:01:08.520
 a moerser we go the piment and the 

00:01:05.489 --> 00:01:10.890
 peppercorns and break these rest 

00:01:08.520 --> 00:01:14.580
 until we have a file or at least 

00:01:10.890 --> 00:01:17.210
 coarsely grained mix get that annas 

00:01:14.580 --> 00:01:19.650
 We will solve the flesh 

00:01:17.210 --> 00:01:21.360
 cutting core out and it 

00:01:19.650 --> 00:01:25.740
 then in small bite-sized 

00:01:21.360 --> 00:01:28.500
 Pieces of prawns or prawns 

00:01:25.740 --> 00:01:30.659
 Tails are washed off afterwards 

00:01:28.500 --> 00:01:34.530
 spotted dry and then with the allspice 

00:01:30.659 --> 00:01:36.270
 Mixture sprinkled everything thoroughly 

00:01:34.530 --> 00:01:37.920
 Mix together and then again 

00:01:36.270 --> 00:01:39.930
 set aside because we only have to 

00:01:37.920 --> 00:01:41.909
 heat some oil in a pan 

00:01:39.930 --> 00:01:44.880
 and then give the prawns 

00:01:41.909 --> 00:01:47.219
 stir in occasionally 

00:01:44.880 --> 00:01:48.869
 Now they will be size dependent 

00:01:47.219 --> 00:01:51.229
 so between three and five minutes 

00:01:48.869 --> 00:01:55.520
 seared 

00:01:51.229 --> 00:01:55.520
 then they are taken out of the pan 

00:01:56.700 --> 00:02:01.119
 and we give the pineapple pieces in the 

00:01:59.229 --> 00:02:03.100
 bratensatz this we pollinate now 

00:02:01.119 --> 00:02:05.320
 the icing sugar and leave it under 

00:02:03.100 --> 00:02:07.210
 Caramelize lightly, stirring constantly 

00:02:05.320 --> 00:02:09.310
 the shining so outside can be 

00:02:07.210 --> 00:02:11.200
 also a little darker and the whole thing 

00:02:09.310 --> 00:02:13.510
 It will take about four minutes now 

00:02:11.200 --> 00:02:17.170
 with the orange juice and the vegetable stock 

00:02:13.510 --> 00:02:20.069
 Deglaze and stir briefly 

00:02:17.170 --> 00:02:20.069
 Boil 

00:02:20.220 --> 00:02:25.569
 the cornflour with a little cold water 

00:02:23.019 --> 00:02:30.610
 stir until smooth and add to the sauce 

00:02:25.569 --> 00:02:32.590
 easily see me simmer then the 

00:02:30.610 --> 00:02:34.959
 reduce heat about a teaspoon 

00:02:32.590 --> 00:02:37.450
 Add sauce to the chilli 

00:02:34.959 --> 00:02:40.709
 if you like more, you can do more and more 

00:02:37.450 --> 00:02:40.709
 to taste everything with salt 

00:02:40.980 --> 00:02:46.599
 then we go back with the shrimp 

00:02:43.180 --> 00:02:50.650
 in and stir and heat everything 

00:02:46.599 --> 00:02:53.049
 the shrimps are together with each other 

00:02:50.650 --> 00:02:55.150
 ready with it ready only the 

00:02:53.049 --> 00:02:57.280
 Coriander rinse dry and dab 

00:02:55.150 --> 00:02:59.440
 corresponding to our required leaflet 

00:02:57.280 --> 00:03:01.780
 pluck it off and when we parallel it 

00:02:59.440 --> 00:03:03.640
 after packing instructions also the 

00:03:01.780 --> 00:03:05.290
 We could serve rice cooked 

00:03:03.640 --> 00:03:07.420
 maybe there is still a piece of 

00:03:05.290 --> 00:03:09.310
 fresh approach and garnished 

00:03:07.420 --> 00:03:11.650
 abound with the koran abundantly 

00:03:09.310 --> 00:03:13.750
 really delicious seafood 

00:03:11.650 --> 00:03:17.700
 I wish you a lot of fun with the 

00:03:13.750 --> 00:03:20.170
 preparation and then quite good appetite 

00:03:17.700 --> 00:03:22.510
 if you want something different from the 

00:03:20.170 --> 00:03:24.430
 water for example trout wants to eat 

00:03:22.510 --> 00:03:26.620
 or you chew on for example 

00:03:24.430 --> 00:03:29.069
 vegetables are better then look 

00:03:26.620 --> 00:03:31.600
 just into these videos 

00:03:29.069 --> 00:03:32.350
 I still have to say until the 

00:03:31.600 --> 00:03:35.280
