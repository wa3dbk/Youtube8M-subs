00:05:47.540 --> 00:05:47.550 
think you treat it differently you know

00:05:47.550 --> 00:05:49.790 
think you treat it differently you know
you're<00:05:48.240> more<00:05:48.420> careful<00:05:48.930> with<00:05:49.020> it<00:05:49.200> in<00:05:49.410> the

00:05:49.790 --> 00:05:49.800 
you're more careful with it in the

00:05:49.800 --> 00:05:52.370 
you're more careful with it in the
kitchen<00:05:49.980> you're<00:05:50.310> more<00:05:50.570> protective<00:05:51.570> of<00:05:51.810> the

00:05:52.370 --> 00:05:52.380 
kitchen you're more protective of the

00:05:52.380 --> 00:05:53.900 
kitchen you're more protective of the
product<00:05:52.770> which<00:05:52.920> you<00:05:53.190> know<00:05:53.280> I<00:05:53.340> think<00:05:53.550> any<00:05:53.670> chef

00:05:53.900 --> 00:05:53.910 
product which you know I think any chef

00:05:53.910 --> 00:05:56.870 
product which you know I think any chef
good<00:05:54.810> chef<00:05:55.050> would<00:05:55.290> be<00:05:55.500> with<00:05:56.460> anything<00:05:56.820> that

00:05:56.870 --> 00:05:56.880 
good chef would be with anything that

00:05:56.880 --> 00:05:58.700 
good chef would be with anything that
they<00:05:57.090> do<00:05:57.150> but<00:05:57.660> I<00:05:57.690> think<00:05:58.050> it<00:05:58.230> even<00:05:58.380> goes<00:05:58.650> further

00:05:58.700 --> 00:05:58.710 
they do but I think it even goes further

00:05:58.710 --> 00:06:01.010 
they do but I think it even goes further
