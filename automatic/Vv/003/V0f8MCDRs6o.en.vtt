 every employee I'm joking but architect 

00:03:09.419 --> 00:03:13.430
 the yacht shows that it is not only close here and not difficult but of the body 

00:03:13.429 --> 00:03:16.559
 So we have a lot more in common. 

00:03:16.559 --> 00:03:19.969
 adress and think because I am but why I try 

00:03:19.969 --> 00:03:22.270
 We do not talk about homage either. 

00:03:22.270 --> 00:03:26.370
 we are still here behind the scenes and we can see that's where it goes 

00:03:26.370 --> 00:03:30.710
 aver in a few minutes until the presentations the staff with children 

00:03:30.710 --> 00:03:32.489
 who are physically disabled 

00:03:32.489 --> 00:03:36.769
 the dinner winds came here first the heat is that you could already feel it is not 

00:03:36.769 --> 00:03:38.319

00:03:38.319 --> 00:03:41.919
 based on impact and come here and really see this great event done in 

00:03:41.919 --> 00:03:43.179
 homage to 0 

00:03:43.179 --> 00:03:46.259

00:03:46.259 --> 00:03:47.600
 special ne 

00:03:47.600 --> 00:03:50.609
 because it is one of the great works in the history of the mother of d. 

00:03:50.609 --> 00:03:53.649
 the five were made by people 

00:03:53.649 --> 00:03:55.239
 not perfect 

00:03:55.239 --> 00:04:01.269
 the great works were done in the middle of the night much sacrifice for people not 

00:04:01.269 --> 00:04:04.499
 perfect eye lay old 

00:04:04.499 --> 00:04:07.599
 did so many with works of music and can not hear 

00:04:07.599 --> 00:04:08.909
 beethoven 

00:04:08.909 --> 00:04:09.800
 So 

00:04:09.800 --> 00:04:15.520
 ge has already started well things that special to because in fact the 

00:04:15.520 --> 00:04:19.130
 perfection does not work is ours and imperfection 

00:04:19.859 --> 00:04:21.400
 that leaves us more beautiful 

00:04:21.400 --> 00:04:24.669
 many Amazonian women, they have a biotype, I do not know if you can tell 

00:04:25.370 --> 00:04:30.120
 I already decided I liked there is some feature of the afternoon there is some 

00:04:30.120 --> 00:04:31.810
 feature is that you can 

00:04:31.810 --> 00:04:34.569
 stay there for like 

00:04:34.569 --> 00:04:35.889
 one more 

00:04:35.889 --> 00:04:40.350
 is to stay there mark deadline states and the nations of the world no I already 

00:04:40.349 --> 00:04:43.539
 I look at the media in my opinion today. 

00:04:43.539 --> 00:04:46.460
 I'm already watching Miss Brazil, I'm already watching her. 

00:04:46.460 --> 00:04:50.389
 why the wind but to be a little seed here it looks like they did not have 

00:04:50.389 --> 00:04:54.740
 and this is the traits worth following you can see the vacancy 

00:04:54.740 --> 00:05:00.180
 a touch of wine from the average Dutch Dutchman with all the affection the newspaper 

00:05:00.180 --> 00:05:04.810
 Dutch 'pirates' you can see the Dutch tracinhos but then phrases 

00:05:04.810 --> 00:05:09.440
 indigenous people with that beautiful nation, in months that are well 

00:05:09.440 --> 00:05:14.460
 This is a law statement that begins early in the 

00:05:14.460 --> 00:05:15.089
 amnesty 

00:05:15.089 --> 00:05:19.519
 a bit of African twist a little hygienic towel the good news because 

00:05:19.519 --> 00:05:20.460
 Spanish 

00:05:20.460 --> 00:05:23.460
 ten perfect lines then all already eye 

00:05:24.089 --> 00:05:27.999
 already attends almost favoring month to month the amazonense is what I have seen until today 

00:05:28.729 --> 00:05:30.009
 So let's see 

00:05:30.009 --> 00:05:34.120
 arrives there on miss brazil sends the ball and is posted extreme brigador by him 

00:05:34.120 --> 00:05:37.389
 he who is receiving a tribute here in the event of architecture 

00:05:37.389 --> 00:05:40.389
 but what in fact is a great architect but of body is not this 

00:06:03.119 --> 00:06:03.969
 Lastly
