00:02:12.290 --> 00:02:12.300 
into the bread and bake this on 108

00:02:12.300 --> 00:02:16.130 
into the bread and bake this on 108
about<00:02:12.870> 10<00:02:13.260> to<00:02:13.380> 15<00:02:13.770> minutes<00:02:14.400> I<00:02:14.600> finished<00:02:15.600> baking

00:02:19.790 --> 00:02:19.800 
the bread until nice and crispy so you

00:02:19.800 --> 00:02:23.540 
the bread until nice and crispy so you
can<00:02:20.100> divide<00:02:20.550> this<00:02:20.880> to<00:02:21.870> get<00:02:22.080> the<00:02:22.290> color<00:02:23.010> of<00:02:23.280> the

00:02:23.540 --> 00:02:23.550 
can divide this to get the color of the

00:02:23.550 --> 00:02:27.770 
can divide this to get the color of the
vegetables<00:02:24.180> so<00:02:24.840> it's<00:02:25.020> nice<00:02:25.290> really<00:02:26.510> soft<00:02:27.510> in

the<00:02:27.900> middle<00:02:28.230> and<00:02:28.440> crusty<00:02:28.950> on<00:02:28.980> top<00:02:29.400> and<00:02:30.140> hope

00:02:31.130 --> 00:02:31.140 
the middle and crusty on top and hope

00:02:31.140 --> 00:02:33.050
