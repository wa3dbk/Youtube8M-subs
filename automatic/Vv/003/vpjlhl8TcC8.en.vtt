00:03:20.089 --> 00:03:20.099 
the house I mean like I guess there

00:03:20.099 --> 00:03:22.300 
the house I mean like I guess there
could<00:03:20.280> be<00:03:20.310> ways<00:03:20.639> that<00:03:20.849> you<00:03:20.970> could<00:03:21.150> basically

00:03:22.300 --> 00:03:22.310 
could be ways that you could basically

00:03:22.310 --> 00:03:25.129 
could be ways that you could basically
abduct<00:03:23.310> a<00:03:23.430> young<00:03:23.819> girl<00:03:24.090> like<00:03:24.269> that<00:03:24.480> but<00:03:24.750> I<00:03:24.959> just

abduct a young girl like that but I just

00:03:25.139 --> 00:03:26.509 
abduct a young girl like that but I just
don't<00:03:25.470> see<00:03:25.620> it<00:03:25.650> happening<00:03:25.919> without<00:03:26.280> them

00:03:26.509 --> 00:03:26.519 
don't see it happening without them

00:03:26.519 --> 00:03:28.280 
don't see it happening without them
blowing<00:03:26.699> willingly<00:03:27.120> and<00:03:27.660> I<00:03:27.870> think<00:03:28.109> that's

00:03:28.280 --> 00:03:28.290 
blowing willingly and I think that's

00:03:28.290 --> 00:03:29.839 
blowing willingly and I think that's
what<00:03:28.440> ended<00:03:28.650> up<00:03:28.739> happening<00:03:28.799> I<00:03:29.340> think

00:03:29.839 --> 00:03:29.849 
what ended up happening I think

00:03:29.849 --> 00:03:32.140 
what ended up happening I think
everything<00:03:30.269> was<00:03:30.480> done<00:03:30.629> was<00:03:30.810> consensual<00:03:31.169> and

00:03:32.140 --> 00:03:32.150 
everything was done was consensual and

00:03:32.150 --> 00:03:34.189 
everything was done was consensual and
when<00:03:33.150> it<00:03:33.209> was<00:03:33.299> all<00:03:33.419> said<00:03:33.449> and<00:03:33.690> done<00:03:33.780> and<00:03:34.049> things

00:03:34.189 --> 00:03:34.199 
when it was all said and done and things

00:03:34.199 --> 00:03:36.199 
when it was all said and done and things
were<00:03:34.349> going<00:03:34.500> down<00:03:34.799> she<00:03:35.190> just<00:03:35.609> turned<00:03:36.000> her<00:03:36.060> back

00:03:36.199 --> 00:03:36.209
