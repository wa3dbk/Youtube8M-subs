you know then will fertilize and put in
a<00:01:27.450> first<00:01:27.780> stage<00:01:28.020> two

00:01:28.990 --> 00:01:29.000 
a first stage two

00:01:29.000 --> 00:01:32.410 
a first stage two
of<00:01:30.040> re-energized<00:01:31.040> the<00:01:31.070> root<00:01:31.790> system<00:01:31.970> again

00:01:32.410 --> 00:01:32.420 
of re-energized the root system again

00:01:32.420 --> 00:01:35.620 
of re-energized the root system again
and<00:01:33.230> a<00:01:33.380> six<00:01:33.680> months<00:01:33.980> later<00:01:34.270> we'll<00:01:35.270> come<00:01:35.450> back
