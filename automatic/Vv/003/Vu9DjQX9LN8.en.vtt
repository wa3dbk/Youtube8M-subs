00:00:53.689 --> 00:00:53.699 
first game you you tried to build this

00:00:53.699 --> 00:00:54.240 
first game you you tried to build this
narrow

00:00:54.240 --> 00:00:54.250 
narrow

00:00:54.250 --> 00:00:57.870 
narrow
yes<00:00:54.880> the<00:00:55.360> first<00:00:55.570> time<00:00:55.890> is<00:00:56.890> because<00:00:57.100> there<00:00:57.760> is

00:00:57.870 --> 00:00:57.880 
yes the first time is because there is

00:00:57.880 --> 00:01:01.710 
yes the first time is because there is
so<00:00:58.090> many<00:00:58.750> elements<00:00:59.680> in<00:01:00.100> the<00:01:00.430> game<00:01:00.580> that<00:01:00.720> also
