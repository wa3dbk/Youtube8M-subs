00:00:12.380 --> 00:00:16.970
 we take with the crime we return 

00:00:14.900 --> 00:00:18.860
 with colin mcrae and do not miss two 

00:00:16.970 --> 00:00:22.610
 departures in the same section and it was without a doubt 

00:00:18.860 --> 00:00:25.220
 some news a day goodbye to the first 

00:00:22.610 --> 00:00:29.590
 that was saved from the hairs it seems that the 

00:00:25.220 --> 00:00:29.590
 which is supported by the sand will come out 

00:00:32.220 --> 00:00:38.070
 let's see the image from the camera 

00:00:35.250 --> 00:00:45.890
 outside, the virgin of the 

00:00:38.070 --> 00:00:45.890
 sections where he returns to make a 

00:00:48.040 --> 00:00:52.340
 I had a luck with this 

00:00:50.210 --> 00:00:56.290
 the station was here 

00:00:52.340 --> 00:00:56.290
 for everything in the next one and we see him 

00:00:56.320 --> 00:01:01.530
 and look at the tree on the right and 

00:00:58.989 --> 00:01:01.530
 dance 

00:01:01.690 --> 00:01:07.159
 plus 

00:01:03.600 --> 00:01:07.159
 hit so against the tree 

00:01:11.180 --> 00:01:17.479
 the car has broken everywhere and now 

00:01:14.640 --> 00:01:17.479
 let's see also 

00:01:17.500 --> 00:01:22.830
 with one of the outer cameras and how 

00:01:19.870 --> 00:01:22.830
 it goes totally 

00:01:25.409 --> 00:01:32.399
 back and totally apart from 

00:01:30.270 --> 00:01:34.049
 rear suspensions and had 

00:01:32.399 --> 00:01:35.939
 forced to leave and we listened to 

00:01:34.049 --> 00:01:39.140
 colin mcrae once 

00:01:35.939 --> 00:01:39.140
 abandoned this finland rally 

00:01:39.960 --> 00:01:47.400
 before we see how in section 2 I 

00:01:43.570 --> 00:01:47.400
 despair because with line is not going rhythm 

00:01:47.770 --> 00:01:51.600
 we know how he is going to let him
