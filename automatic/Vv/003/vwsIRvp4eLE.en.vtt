00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:06.480
 Hello friends, probably the most 

00:00:03.929 --> 00:00:08.820
 Scottish island Isle gave us 

00:00:06.480 --> 00:00:11.040
 today for tasting your sample 

00:00:08.820 --> 00:00:14.490
 but how much in a little peat on 

00:00:11.040 --> 00:00:18.270
 to find out a little later moon havan 

00:00:14.490 --> 00:00:18.869
 Darfur is poured on the fortress 46.3 percent 

00:00:18.270 --> 00:00:21.480
 alcohol 

00:00:18.869 --> 00:00:24.150
 but do not be fooled by this 

00:00:21.480 --> 00:00:27.750
 the figure is in no way a barrel 

00:00:24.150 --> 00:00:29.720
 Funa fortress haven one of the eighth 

00:00:27.750 --> 00:00:32.550
 one of eight distilleries from Islay 

00:00:29.720 --> 00:00:33.120
 located near the ferry to the island 

00:00:32.550 --> 00:00:35.809
 jura 

00:00:33.120 --> 00:00:40.110
 and this is probably the most difficult 

00:00:35.809 --> 00:00:42.690
 Distillery Islands drives from it 

00:00:40.110 --> 00:00:45.020
 famous for its low smoke you but 

00:00:42.690 --> 00:00:49.730
 very popular among collectors 

00:00:45.020 --> 00:00:49.730
 let's taste this sample 

00:00:53.600 --> 00:00:59.789
 key word in this sample 

00:00:56.219 --> 00:01:02.340
 single malt is dried apricots or 

00:00:59.789 --> 00:01:05.010
 even a fat compote of dried apricots with a large 

00:01:02.340 --> 00:01:07.740
 the amount of sugar that leads me to 

00:01:05.010 --> 00:01:16.380
 the thought of sherry chains which this 

00:01:07.740 --> 00:01:18.750
 the sample was soak in taste and again 

00:01:16.380 --> 00:01:20.930
 Dried apricots dominate a large number 

00:01:18.750 --> 00:01:25.200
 I will bring mowed grass and leaves 

00:01:20.930 --> 00:01:28.409
 camphor alder and so on it is enough 

00:01:25.200 --> 00:01:29.670
 unusual pattern but unfortunately sherry 

00:01:28.409 --> 00:01:33.000
 in taste here and does not smell 

00:01:29.670 --> 00:01:35.340
 so we state that the service 

00:01:33.000 --> 00:01:38.610
 more than likely at this excerpt 

00:01:35.340 --> 00:01:40.680
 whiskey and aftertaste used 

00:01:38.610 --> 00:01:44.579
 average duration is enough 

00:01:40.680 --> 00:01:47.119
 easy and not crushing our total score 

00:01:44.579 --> 00:01:49.710
 so molto 84 

00:01:47.119 --> 00:01:52.409
 because the bottle is worth a lot of money 

00:01:49.710 --> 00:01:53.479
 Russia we put on pleasure by 

00:01:52.409 --> 00:01:57.930
 relation to price 

00:01:53.479 --> 00:02:02.390
 85 points these are good whiskey and look 

00:01:57.930 --> 00:02:02.390
 our tasting on the channel vesker cheers
