00:00:16.110 --> 00:00:21.730
 hi everyone guys are a kidal and me 

00:00:19.150 --> 00:00:24.099
 today I will go to the limestone with a good 49 

00:00:21.730 --> 00:00:26.529
 giants then an attack with solo 

00:00:24.099 --> 00:00:28.540
 giant boys let's see what will come out of it 

00:00:26.529 --> 00:00:30.400
 I hope not to file like in mine 

00:00:28.540 --> 00:00:32.349
 usually do because they are very scarce 

00:00:30.400 --> 00:00:34.540
 you know but unfortunately it's so guys 

00:00:32.349 --> 00:00:37.030
 so as you can see the giants are 

00:00:34.540 --> 00:00:39.699
 these here in we have 44 in 

00:00:37.030 --> 00:00:40.690
 camps pv 5 in the case of the grand 

00:00:39.699 --> 00:00:43.059
 donated by the clan 

00:00:40.690 --> 00:00:45.790
 I thank my friends of the horse 15 

00:00:43.059 --> 00:00:48.580
 remember they are the one hundred level unique clubs 

00:00:45.790 --> 00:00:51.670
 more if you want to enter spells 

00:00:48.580 --> 00:00:56.080
 we're going to attack with two healings 

00:00:51.670 --> 00:00:57.850
 2 care of the two furies then excuse the 

00:00:56.080 --> 00:00:59.170
 furies to speed up the giants they are 

00:00:57.850 --> 00:01:01.210
 very slow that the cure to heal 

00:00:59.170 --> 00:01:03.070
 when they are going to die 

00:01:01.210 --> 00:01:05.290
 we hope not to hurt you won 

00:01:03.070 --> 00:01:09.310
 first tell me if you like this style 

00:01:05.290 --> 00:01:10.690
 then the with the webcam and with and with 

00:01:09.310 --> 00:01:13.240
 the enav attack is therefore not a 

00:01:10.690 --> 00:01:14.950
 comments there with a recorded attack 

00:01:13.240 --> 00:01:16.960
 with tell me if you like 

00:01:14.950 --> 00:01:18.970
 now we're going to attack right away 

00:01:16.960 --> 00:01:21.610
 we see very little else that I have 

00:01:18.970 --> 00:01:23.380
 found a player to attack 

00:01:21.610 --> 00:01:25.060
 here we are guys after really a 

00:01:23.380 --> 00:01:27.250
 time mess I found ours 

00:01:25.060 --> 00:01:30.160
 attack village has started a 

00:01:27.250 --> 00:01:31.180
 ranks at random but I don't think it does 

00:01:30.160 --> 00:01:33.130
 of evil 

00:01:31.180 --> 00:01:35.230
 we therefore have 40 giants 

00:01:33.130 --> 00:01:37.830
 availability the troops of the 

00:01:35.230 --> 00:01:42.970
 clans that will be a big problem 

00:01:37.830 --> 00:01:45.550
 so let's put a giant here 

00:01:42.970 --> 00:01:48.610
 ok let's put our barbarian king there 

00:01:45.550 --> 00:01:50.050
 should pulverize instantly and then 

00:01:48.610 --> 00:01:52.870
 let's put all the other giants 

00:01:50.050 --> 00:01:55.000
 at this point ok 

00:01:52.870 --> 00:01:56.130
 will be a great offelle guys me 

00:01:55.000 --> 00:01:57.780
 sorry but 

00:01:56.130 --> 00:02:01.320
 unfortunately I 'm not capable of 

00:01:57.780 --> 00:02:03.030
 attack then we have our 49 

00:02:01.320 --> 00:02:05.310
 giants we put a good fury for 

00:02:03.030 --> 00:02:07.770
 make a mess we avoid though 

00:02:05.310 --> 00:02:09.840
 exactly again let's see what 

00:02:07.770 --> 00:02:12.480
 will come out is widening to free similar 

00:02:09.840 --> 00:02:14.040
 unfortunately my computer is so young 

00:02:12.480 --> 00:02:16.620
 we can not do anything we put 

00:02:14.040 --> 00:02:20.660
 even giants behind we see that they go 

00:02:16.620 --> 00:02:23.099
 great and destructive as never before 

00:02:20.660 --> 00:02:24.900
 they are separating for a moment now 

00:02:23.099 --> 00:02:27.120
 we are ready to take good care of you 

00:02:24.900 --> 00:02:29.730
 Just come here the center of the 

00:02:27.120 --> 00:02:32.190
 village anyway kid is going 

00:02:29.730 --> 00:02:35.010
 very badly an attack because i anyway 

00:02:32.190 --> 00:02:36.780
 There are so many giants and the city is 

00:02:35.010 --> 00:02:38.730
 pretty poor just wandering around 

00:02:36.780 --> 00:02:39.830
 like never before, that is, boys I don't understand 

00:02:38.730 --> 00:02:42.690
 nothing more 

00:02:39.830 --> 00:02:49.049
 let's not lose concentration 

00:02:42.690 --> 00:02:53.280
 a cure that surely ahi ahi ahi 

00:02:49.049 --> 00:02:57.569
 Too many bombs to have ok 

00:02:53.280 --> 00:02:59.940
 call another ok here very well 

00:02:57.569 --> 00:03:01.530
 I don't know if it rhymes for months 

00:02:59.940 --> 00:03:03.900
 time guys because anyway restif i 

00:03:01.530 --> 00:03:06.840
 songs are very slow ie one thing 

00:03:03.900 --> 00:03:09.420
 indescribable in slowness and we see that 

00:03:06.840 --> 00:03:12.840
 I don't know or at least they are now 

00:03:09.420 --> 00:03:14.100
 attacking here could be a 

00:03:12.840 --> 00:03:16.769
 danger could be a mere in 

00:03:14.100 --> 00:03:17.540
 attack will only be the time we say a 

00:03:16.769 --> 00:03:19.920
 tell us 

00:03:17.540 --> 00:03:22.709
 we want still here slowly 

00:03:19.920 --> 00:03:26.430
 the giants are dying so it will be a 

00:03:22.709 --> 00:03:28.920
 film will be a movie I don't know anyway 

00:03:26.430 --> 00:03:32.459
 I would put a fury somewhere 

00:03:28.920 --> 00:03:34.410
 I don't really know where because anyway 

00:03:32.459 --> 00:03:36.239
 the most compact group is this guys here 

00:03:34.410 --> 00:03:37.560
 and we must try to send it 

00:03:36.239 --> 00:03:40.920
 ahead and too much are dying of 

00:03:37.560 --> 00:03:44.609
 we can therefore say in vain giants 

00:03:40.920 --> 00:03:50.940
 now let's see let's see a 

00:03:44.609 --> 00:03:54.060
 little what to do ok let's put a where 

00:03:50.940 --> 00:04:00.150
 the water could be a fury here 

00:03:54.060 --> 00:04:03.569
 a great idea or a great crap 

00:04:00.150 --> 00:04:06.060
 then yes very well ok ok ok because 

00:04:03.569 --> 00:04:08.160
 we have a minute and 27 to destroy 

00:04:06.060 --> 00:04:09.359
 these defenses and then destroy it all 

00:04:08.160 --> 00:04:12.209
 we can do the village 

00:04:09.359 --> 00:04:14.120
 let's hope so guys come on from the give 

00:04:12.209 --> 00:04:16.859
 come on come on come on 

00:04:14.120 --> 00:04:19.669
 if we finish destroying the defenses he has 

00:04:16.859 --> 00:04:23.840
 just done that time is little guys 

00:04:19.669 --> 00:04:27.060
 no we will do 16 

00:04:23.840 --> 00:04:32.180
 let's see let's see then it is 

00:04:27.060 --> 00:04:34.710
 let's zoom in on some migrants well well 

00:04:32.180 --> 00:04:37.949
 careful attention a cannon is missing 

00:04:34.710 --> 00:04:42.180
 a cannon one minute and two new giant 

00:04:37.949 --> 00:04:45.240
 perfect if there is a trap set there 

00:04:42.180 --> 00:04:50.880
 hello sends everyone a bomb worth good 

00:04:45.240 --> 00:04:52.290
 okay okay okay ok fine 

00:04:50.880 --> 00:04:57.740
 meanwhile we see our true rival 

00:04:52.290 --> 00:04:59.729
 who is doing the dirty work you can 

00:04:57.740 --> 00:05:04.139
 we have destroyed all defenses 

00:04:59.729 --> 00:05:04.530
 guys we saw everything all 

00:05:04.139 --> 00:05:07.259
 defenses 

00:05:04.530 --> 00:05:08.820
 we are champions that is sorry 

00:05:07.259 --> 00:05:11.400
 boys, but these are the thoughts 

00:05:08.820 --> 00:05:14.880
 unfortunately, it is never like that 

00:05:11.400 --> 00:05:16.560
 let's see if they take their love horse 

00:05:14.880 --> 00:05:17.430
 let's hope so only this is missing 

00:05:16.560 --> 00:05:22.080
 storage area 

00:05:17.430 --> 00:05:23.640
 very pity both good and good less 

00:05:22.080 --> 00:05:28.460
 bad so we made a movie 

00:05:23.640 --> 00:05:32.400
 total okay okay 

00:05:28.460 --> 00:05:35.660
 no sorry guys but that's the truth 

00:05:32.400 --> 00:05:39.030
 that is, we can't do anything about it 

00:05:35.660 --> 00:05:42.270
 13 seconds I 'm playing the game too 

00:05:39.030 --> 00:05:45.570
 City Hall we can't make it to 

00:05:42.270 --> 00:05:48.210
 destroy it shit for a hair guys 

00:05:45.570 --> 00:05:50.730
 because really now with others 30 

00:05:48.210 --> 00:05:54.030
 seconds destroyed the whole city 

00:05:50.730 --> 00:05:56.940
 shame sin I should have maybe 

00:05:54.030 --> 00:06:00.410
 to use 4 fury I don't know you tell me 

00:05:56.940 --> 00:06:03.480
 however we took 164 thousand violas 

00:06:00.410 --> 00:06:07.200
 160,000 eli I would say a good 136 of 

00:06:03.480 --> 00:06:09.360
 black elixir seven 49 giant trophies 

00:06:07.200 --> 00:06:11.460
 go for it because with barbarism there is 

00:06:09.360 --> 00:06:14.190
 there was clearly better good 

00:06:11.460 --> 00:06:16.740
 guys this was my ata attack 

00:06:14.190 --> 00:06:18.810
 composes the lithium cable but with the giants 

00:06:16.740 --> 00:06:21.300
 you can't do much sorry because 

00:06:18.810 --> 00:06:23.310
 however it is given an active crew 

00:06:21.300 --> 00:06:25.410
 But you have to put something behind 

00:06:23.310 --> 00:06:27.030
 to support them because when not there 

00:06:25.410 --> 00:06:28.890
 greetings from all the defenses are anyway 

00:06:27.030 --> 00:06:31.110
 very slow they are not like the tamers who 

00:06:28.890 --> 00:06:33.240
 however skipping the tack are super 

00:06:31.110 --> 00:06:35.610
 fast so maybe I should have used 

00:06:33.240 --> 00:06:37.830
 4 out as I said before though 

00:06:35.610 --> 00:06:39.930
 maybe then all the giants die 

00:06:37.830 --> 00:06:41.699
 so we couldn't do anything about it 

00:06:39.930 --> 00:06:43.500
 however we still got a 

00:06:41.699 --> 00:06:45.330
 spoils not bad so if the video is there 

00:06:43.500 --> 00:06:47.610
 liked the minsitro bar I like it 

00:06:45.330 --> 00:06:50.759

00:06:47.610 --> 00:06:52.919

00:06:50.759 --> 00:06:56.159
