here's<00:00:51.360> the<00:00:51.570> the<00:00:52.250> old<00:00:53.250> bushing

00:00:54.860 --> 00:00:54.870 
here's the the old bushing

00:00:54.870 --> 00:01:04.860 
here's the the old bushing
now<00:00:55.730> to<00:00:56.730> compare<00:00:57.180> here's<00:00:57.480> the<00:00:57.600> new<00:00:57.780> bushing

00:01:04.860 --> 00:01:04.870 

00:01:04.870 --> 00:01:16.440 

it's<00:01:05.110> really<00:01:05.580> really<00:01:06.580> brittle

00:01:16.440 --> 00:01:16.450 

00:01:16.450 --> 00:01:22.389 

I've<00:01:17.450> gotten<00:01:17.979> new<00:01:18.979> washers<00:01:21.009> just<00:01:22.009> to<00:01:22.100> let<00:01:22.250> you

00:01:22.389 --> 00:01:22.399 
I've gotten new washers just to let you

00:01:22.399 --> 00:01:24.399 
I've gotten new washers just to let you
know<00:01:22.579> these<00:01:22.850> are<00:01:23.000> the<00:01:23.060> last<00:01:23.240> two<00:01:23.600> in<00:01:24.259> the

United States these two part numbers

00:01:27.020 --> 00:01:32.560 
United States these two part numbers
last<00:01:27.740> two<00:01:28.130> I<00:01:28.539> have<00:01:29.539> them<00:01:30.700> let's<00:01:31.700> see<00:01:31.939> how<00:01:32.270> bad

00:01:32.560 --> 00:01:32.570 
last two I have them let's see how bad

00:01:32.570 --> 00:01:35.919 
last two I have them let's see how bad
this<00:01:32.840> bar<00:01:33.140> really<00:01:33.530> is<00:01:34.659> what<00:01:35.659> the<00:01:35.780> other

00:01:35.919 --> 00:01:35.929 
this bar really is what the other

00:01:35.929 --> 00:01:45.580 
this bar really is what the other
bushing<00:01:36.470> look<00:01:36.740> at<00:01:36.860> that<00:01:38.229> that<00:01:39.229> is<00:01:39.649> bad<00:01:43.270> and<00:01:44.590> I

00:01:45.580 --> 00:01:45.590 
bushing look at that that is bad and I

00:01:45.590 --> 00:01:47.319 
bushing look at that that is bad and I
taking<00:01:45.979> all<00:01:46.130> these<00:01:46.280> out<00:01:46.579> including<00:01:47.060> the

00:02:08.710 --> 00:02:08.720 
side I got all new go on this side and I

00:02:08.720 --> 00:02:11.170 
side I got all new go on this side and I
also<00:02:08.869> have<00:02:09.200> the<00:02:09.709> other<00:02:10.190> side<00:02:10.519> which<00:02:11.000> we're

00:02:11.170 --> 00:02:11.180 
also have the other side which we're

00:02:11.180 --> 00:02:12.670 
also have the other side which we're
going<00:02:11.299> to<00:02:11.360> get<00:02:11.450> you<00:02:11.510> now<00:02:11.810> let's<00:02:12.290> take<00:02:12.440> those

00:02:12.670 --> 00:02:12.680 
going to get you now let's take those

00:02:12.680 --> 00:02:19.900 
going to get you now let's take those
two<00:02:12.920> off<00:02:13.160> and<00:02:13.580> then<00:02:14.360> it<00:02:14.510> comes<00:02:14.780> right<00:02:15.530> out<00:02:18.910> even

00:02:19.900 --> 00:02:19.910 
two off and then it comes right out even

00:02:19.910 --> 00:02:21.970 
two off and then it comes right out even
the<00:02:20.000> old<00:02:20.180> one<00:02:20.420> has<00:02:20.630> teeth<00:02:20.930> on<00:02:21.230> the<00:02:21.380> bear<00:02:21.590> on<00:02:21.829> the

00:02:21.970 --> 00:02:21.980 
the old one has teeth on the bear on the

00:02:21.980 --> 00:02:25.420 
the old one has teeth on the bear on the
bushings<00:02:22.660> hey<00:02:23.660> that's<00:02:23.920> one<00:02:24.920> of<00:02:25.040> the<00:02:25.100> reasons

00:02:25.420 --> 00:02:25.430 
bushings hey that's one of the reasons

00:02:25.430 --> 00:02:30.099 
bushings hey that's one of the reasons
why<00:02:25.609> I<00:02:26.500> like<00:02:27.500> it<00:02:27.859> like<00:02:28.459> this<00:02:28.660> the<00:02:29.660> boat<00:02:29.870> with

00:02:30.099 --> 00:02:30.109 
why I like it like this the boat with

00:02:30.109 --> 00:02:32.740 
why I like it like this the boat with
the<00:02:30.290> bushings<00:02:30.859> having<00:02:31.130> teeth<00:02:31.400> because<00:02:32.390> rubber

00:02:32.740 --> 00:02:32.750 
the bushings having teeth because rubber

00:02:32.750 --> 00:02:35.949 
the bushings having teeth because rubber
can<00:02:33.140> act<00:02:33.319> like<00:02:33.440> a<00:02:33.530> spring<00:02:34.390> that<00:02:35.390> allows<00:02:35.720> you<00:02:35.900> to

00:02:35.949 --> 00:02:35.959 
can act like a spring that allows you to

00:02:35.959 --> 00:02:38.800 
can act like a spring that allows you to
preload<00:02:36.500> the<00:02:36.709> bushing<00:02:37.100> so<00:02:37.700> you<00:02:38.480> can<00:02:38.630> tighten

00:02:38.800 --> 00:02:38.810 
preload the bushing so you can tighten

00:02:38.810 --> 00:02:41.470 
preload the bushing so you can tighten
it<00:02:38.989> up<00:02:39.109> and<00:02:39.410> then<00:02:39.859> I'll<00:02:39.950> be<00:02:40.040> set<00:02:40.340> and<00:02:40.579> then

00:02:41.470 --> 00:02:41.480 
it up and then I'll be set and then

00:02:41.480 --> 00:02:43.660 
it up and then I'll be set and then
whenever<00:02:42.200> you<00:02:42.470> have<00:02:42.620> like<00:02:42.829> bouncing<00:02:43.310> movement

00:02:43.660 --> 00:02:43.670 
whenever you have like bouncing movement

00:02:43.670 --> 00:02:44.949 
whenever you have like bouncing movement
or<00:02:43.760> whatnot<00:02:43.940> it<00:02:44.209> will<00:02:44.329> just<00:02:44.450> spring<00:02:44.750> back<00:02:44.930> to

00:02:44.949 --> 00:02:44.959 
or whatnot it will just spring back to

00:02:44.959 --> 00:02:47.470 
or whatnot it will just spring back to
where<00:02:45.230> you<00:02:45.350> want<00:02:45.590> it<00:02:45.650> to<00:02:45.709> be<00:02:45.819> which<00:02:46.819> is<00:02:46.850> why<00:02:47.180> I'm

00:02:47.470 --> 00:02:47.480 
where you want it to be which is why I'm

00:02:47.480 --> 00:02:49.509 
where you want it to be which is why I'm
going<00:02:47.660> to<00:02:47.750> replace<00:02:48.049> these<00:02:48.380> with<00:02:48.440> the<00:02:49.280> original

00:02:49.509 --> 00:02:49.519 
going to replace these with the original

00:02:49.519 --> 00:02:53.620 
going to replace these with the original
bushings<00:02:50.209> and<00:02:50.389> not<00:02:50.600> probably<00:02:51.049> urethane<00:02:52.630> yeah

00:02:53.620 --> 00:02:53.630 
bushings and not probably urethane yeah

00:02:53.630 --> 00:02:55.690 
bushings and not probably urethane yeah
so<00:02:54.019> next<00:02:54.200> is<00:02:54.410> to<00:02:54.590> get<00:02:54.769> this<00:02:54.950> out<00:02:55.190> and<00:02:55.459> then<00:02:55.549> put

00:02:55.690 --> 00:02:55.700 
so next is to get this out and then put

00:02:55.700 --> 00:02:57.340 
so next is to get this out and then put
the<00:02:55.880> new<00:02:56.030> bushing<00:02:56.450> in<00:02:56.600> and<00:02:56.840> then<00:02:57.019> put<00:02:57.139> it<00:02:57.230> all

00:02:57.340 --> 00:02:57.350 
the new bushing in and then put it all

00:02:57.350 --> 00:02:59.199 
the new bushing in and then put it all
back<00:02:57.470> together<00:02:57.650> and<00:02:58.639> then<00:02:58.760> go<00:02:58.850> for<00:02:59.000> test

00:02:59.199 --> 00:02:59.209 
back together and then go for test

00:02:59.209 --> 00:03:01.750 
back together and then go for test
drives<00:02:59.269> now<00:02:59.920> after<00:03:00.920> a<00:03:00.950> couple<00:03:01.280> days<00:03:01.519> of

00:03:01.750 --> 00:03:01.760 
drives now after a couple days of

00:03:01.760 --> 00:03:06.120 
drives now after a couple days of
waiting<00:03:01.940> and<00:03:02.329> getting<00:03:03.319> my<00:03:04.220> hands<00:03:04.459> on<00:03:04.579> a<00:03:04.670> vice<00:03:04.940> I

00:03:06.120 --> 00:03:06.130 
waiting and getting my hands on a vice I

00:03:06.130 --> 00:03:08.620 
waiting and getting my hands on a vice I
push<00:03:07.130> out<00:03:07.340> the<00:03:07.459> old<00:03:07.579> bushing<00:03:08.000> and<00:03:08.120> put<00:03:08.389> the<00:03:08.600> new

00:03:08.620 --> 00:03:08.630 
push out the old bushing and put the new

00:03:08.630 --> 00:03:12.160 
push out the old bushing and put the new
bushing<00:03:09.290> in<00:03:09.470> the<00:03:09.680> bar<00:03:10.269> now<00:03:11.269> like<00:03:11.750> I<00:03:11.900> said<00:03:11.930> I

00:03:12.160 --> 00:03:12.170 
bushing in the bar now like I said I

00:03:12.170 --> 00:03:17.140 
bushing in the bar now like I said I
have<00:03:12.560> all<00:03:13.160> new<00:03:15.430> bushings<00:03:16.430> and<00:03:16.639> everything

00:03:17.140 --> 00:03:17.150 
have all new bushings and everything

00:03:17.150 --> 00:03:19.059 
have all new bushings and everything
that<00:03:17.239> goes<00:03:17.359> with<00:03:17.420> it<00:03:17.660> so<00:03:18.319> let's<00:03:18.560> put<00:03:18.709> this<00:03:18.829> bar

00:03:19.059 --> 00:03:19.069 
that goes with it so let's put this bar

00:03:19.069 --> 00:03:21.330 
that goes with it so let's put this bar
in<00:03:19.310> have<00:03:19.790> to<00:03:19.940> start<00:03:20.209> with<00:03:20.329> this<00:03:20.450> side<00:03:20.510> first

00:03:21.330 --> 00:03:21.340 
in have to start with this side first

00:03:21.340 --> 00:03:22.680 
in have to start with this side first
those<00:03:22.340> in

00:03:22.680 --> 00:03:22.690 
those in

00:03:22.690 --> 00:03:27.480 
those in
there<00:03:22.840> and<00:03:23.440> with<00:03:24.190> the<00:03:24.220> new<00:03:24.370> nut<00:03:24.820> and<00:03:25.090> bolt<00:03:26.490> just

00:03:27.480 --> 00:03:27.490 
there and with the new nut and bolt just

00:03:27.490 --> 00:03:29.010 
there and with the new nut and bolt just
slide<00:03:27.730> it<00:03:27.910> up<00:03:28.030> there<00:03:28.210> now<00:03:28.390> we<00:03:28.450> can't<00:03:28.720> tighten

00:03:29.010 --> 00:03:29.020 
slide it up there now we can't tighten

00:03:29.020 --> 00:03:32.630 
slide it up there now we can't tighten
it<00:03:29.260> just<00:03:29.530> yet<00:03:30.750> can't<00:03:31.750> tighten<00:03:31.960> either<00:03:32.350> side

00:03:32.630 --> 00:03:32.640 
it just yet can't tighten either side

00:03:32.640 --> 00:03:36.990 
it just yet can't tighten either side
until<00:03:33.640> I<00:03:34.420> lower<00:03:35.140> the<00:03:35.350> car<00:03:35.560> and<00:03:35.890> bounce<00:03:36.670> up<00:03:36.910> and

00:03:36.990 --> 00:03:37.000 
until I lower the car and bounce up and

00:03:37.000 --> 00:03:39.780 
until I lower the car and bounce up and
down<00:03:37.120> on<00:03:37.240> the<00:03:37.480> suspension<00:03:37.900> and<00:03:38.320> then<00:03:39.220> I<00:03:39.490> raise

00:03:39.780 --> 00:03:39.790 
down on the suspension and then I raise

00:03:39.790 --> 00:03:42.420 
down on the suspension and then I raise
it<00:03:39.940> back<00:03:40.090> up<00:03:40.150> and<00:03:40.630> tighten<00:03:40.960> it<00:03:41.110> up<00:03:41.430> remember

00:03:42.420 --> 00:03:42.430 
it back up and tighten it up remember

00:03:42.430 --> 00:03:44.460 
it back up and tighten it up remember
the<00:03:42.550> test<00:03:42.790> that<00:03:43.000> i<00:03:43.030> did<00:03:43.300> when<00:03:43.780> i<00:03:43.810> told<00:03:44.140> the<00:03:44.290> book

00:03:44.460 --> 00:03:44.470 
the test that i did when i told the book

00:03:44.470 --> 00:03:46.530 
the test that i did when i told the book
pulled<00:03:45.220> it<00:03:45.370> off<00:03:45.490> this<00:03:45.670> side<00:03:45.940> i<00:03:45.970> wiggled<00:03:46.450> it

00:03:46.530 --> 00:03:46.540 
pulled it off this side i wiggled it

00:03:46.540 --> 00:03:48.720 
pulled it off this side i wiggled it
back<00:03:46.720> and<00:03:46.930> forth<00:03:47.250> now<00:03:48.250> i'm<00:03:48.340> going<00:03:48.430> to<00:03:48.490> try<00:03:48.610> it

00:03:48.720 --> 00:03:48.730 
back and forth now i'm going to try it

00:03:48.730 --> 00:03:52.230 
back and forth now i'm going to try it
with<00:03:48.850> this<00:03:49.030> one<00:03:50.100> barely<00:03:51.100> as<00:03:51.370> much<00:03:51.610> movement<00:03:51.850> of

00:03:52.230 --> 00:03:52.240 
with this one barely as much movement of

00:03:52.240 --> 00:03:55.260 
with this one barely as much movement of
course<00:03:52.450> it's<00:03:52.630> not<00:03:52.720> tight<00:03:53.850> because<00:03:54.850> I<00:03:55.000> can't

00:03:55.260 --> 00:03:55.270 
course it's not tight because I can't

00:03:55.270 --> 00:04:04.470 
course it's not tight because I can't
tighten<00:03:55.510> it<00:03:56.730> next<00:03:57.730> is<00:04:02.460> now<00:04:03.460> these<00:04:03.640> but<00:04:03.910> these

00:04:04.470 --> 00:04:04.480 
tighten it next is now these but these

00:04:04.480 --> 00:04:06.270 
tighten it next is now these but these
washers<00:04:04.930> have<00:04:05.200> a<00:04:05.230> specific<00:04:05.470> way<00:04:05.830> to<00:04:05.890> go<00:04:06.070> on

00:04:06.270 --> 00:04:06.280 
washers have a specific way to go on

00:04:06.280 --> 00:04:10.290 
washers have a specific way to go on
because<00:04:06.580> they're<00:04:06.850> tapered<00:04:07.300> so<00:04:09.060> it's<00:04:10.060> going<00:04:10.210> to

00:04:10.290 --> 00:04:10.300 
because they're tapered so it's going to

00:04:10.300 --> 00:04:14.970 
because they're tapered so it's going to
go<00:04:10.420> on<00:04:10.630> like<00:04:11.440> this<00:04:13.050> so<00:04:14.050> we<00:04:14.560> have<00:04:14.680> a<00:04:14.710> specific

00:04:14.970 --> 00:04:14.980 
go on like this so we have a specific

00:04:14.980 --> 00:04:19.930 
go on like this so we have a specific
order<00:04:15.460> here

00:04:19.930 --> 00:04:19.940 

00:04:19.940 --> 00:05:03.050 

here<00:04:20.450> we<00:04:20.540> go

00:05:03.050 --> 00:05:03.060 

00:05:03.060 --> 00:05:05.510 

now<00:05:03.660> I<00:05:03.690> gotta<00:05:03.990> get<00:05:04.260> it<00:05:04.350> off<00:05:04.470> I<00:05:04.800> got<00:05:05.310> to<00:05:05.370> put<00:05:05.460> the

00:05:05.510 --> 00:05:05.520 
now I gotta get it off I got to put the

00:05:05.520 --> 00:05:08.360 
now I gotta get it off I got to put the
wheels<00:05:05.669> back<00:05:05.910> on<00:05:06.150> and<00:05:06.770> take<00:05:07.770> the<00:05:07.889> jack<00:05:08.130> stands

00:05:08.360 --> 00:05:08.370 
wheels back on and take the jack stands

00:05:08.370 --> 00:05:10.370 
wheels back on and take the jack stands
off<00:05:08.580> and<00:05:08.790> then<00:05:08.910> bounce<00:05:09.090> on<00:05:09.389> the<00:05:09.450> suspension<00:05:09.840> to

00:05:10.370 --> 00:05:10.380 
off and then bounce on the suspension to

00:05:10.380 --> 00:05:14.120 
off and then bounce on the suspension to
level<00:05:11.100> it<00:05:11.160> out<00:05:11.310> then<00:05:12.150> jack<00:05:12.510> up<00:05:12.750> the<00:05:13.130> the

00:05:14.120 --> 00:05:14.130 
level it out then jack up the the

00:05:14.130 --> 00:05:16.340 
level it out then jack up the the
pumpkin<00:05:14.550> again<00:05:14.850> and<00:05:15.090> then<00:05:16.080> tighten

00:05:16.340 --> 00:05:16.350 
pumpkin again and then tighten

00:05:16.350 --> 00:05:23.480 
pumpkin again and then tighten
everything<00:05:16.560> down<00:05:16.860> and<00:05:21.710> there<00:05:22.710> it<00:05:22.860> is<00:05:22.950> Titan

00:05:23.480 --> 00:05:23.490 
everything down and there it is Titan

00:05:23.490 --> 00:05:27.080 
everything down and there it is Titan
that's<00:05:24.060> a<00:05:24.330> Titan<00:05:24.660> both<00:05:24.840> sides<00:05:25.139> I<00:05:25.940> did<00:05:26.940> this

00:05:27.080 --> 00:05:27.090 
that's a Titan both sides I did this

00:05:27.090 --> 00:05:29.090 
that's a Titan both sides I did this
