were today from UPS so we are ready to
go<00:03:50.880> rough<00:03:51.880> dimensions<00:03:52.090> as<00:03:52.780> 3<00:03:53.079> inches<00:03:53.410> by<00:03:53.650> 1

00:03:53.879 --> 00:03:53.889 
go rough dimensions as 3 inches by 1

00:03:53.889 --> 00:03:56.490 
go rough dimensions as 3 inches by 1
inch<00:03:54.450> so<00:03:55.450> it's<00:03:55.690> approximately<00:03:55.810> the<00:03:56.470> right

00:03:56.490 --> 00:03:56.500 
inch so it's approximately the right

00:03:56.500 --> 00:03:59.699 
inch so it's approximately the right
size<00:03:56.889> for<00:03:56.920> a<00:03:57.220> big<00:03:57.400> block<00:03:58.260> the<00:03:59.260> big<00:03:59.440> thing

00:03:59.699 --> 00:03:59.709 
size for a big block the big thing

00:03:59.709 --> 00:04:02.339 
size for a big block the big thing
actually<00:04:00.430> it's<00:04:00.549> just<00:04:00.730> important<00:04:01.239> the<00:04:01.780> part<00:04:02.290> of

00:04:02.339 --> 00:04:02.349 
actually it's just important the part of

00:04:02.349 --> 00:04:03.900 
actually it's just important the part of
the<00:04:02.410> reason<00:04:02.500> why<00:04:02.680> I<00:04:02.799> ended<00:04:02.980> up<00:04:03.160> being<00:04:03.459> this<00:04:03.639> big

00:04:03.900 --> 00:04:03.910 
the reason why I ended up being this big

00:04:03.910 --> 00:04:07.319 
the reason why I ended up being this big
not<00:04:04.900> bigger<00:04:05.200> not<00:04:05.560> smaller<00:04:05.819> was<00:04:06.819> on<00:04:07.030> the<00:04:07.150> Wraith

00:04:07.319 --> 00:04:07.329 
not bigger not smaller was on the Wraith

00:04:07.329 --> 00:04:08.909 
not bigger not smaller was on the Wraith
it<00:04:07.569> could<00:04:07.720> be<00:04:07.870> a<00:04:07.900> little<00:04:08.109> larger<00:04:08.319> and<00:04:08.680> still

00:04:08.909 --> 00:04:08.919 
it could be a little larger and still

00:04:08.919 --> 00:04:10.979 
it could be a little larger and still
look<00:04:09.069> okay<00:04:09.489> but<00:04:10.209> if<00:04:10.329> you<00:04:10.420> want<00:04:10.599> to<00:04:10.629> put<00:04:10.750> this<00:04:10.840> on

00:04:10.979 --> 00:04:10.989 
look okay but if you want to put this on

00:04:10.989 --> 00:04:12.700 
look okay but if you want to put this on
a<00:04:11.049> honcho<00:04:11.620> or

00:04:12.700 --> 00:04:12.710 
a honcho or

00:04:12.710 --> 00:04:15.220 
a honcho or
then<00:04:12.860> you<00:04:13.040> know<00:04:13.160> smaller<00:04:13.550> more<00:04:14.000> scale<00:04:14.390> scalar

00:04:15.220 --> 00:04:15.230 
then you know smaller more scale scalar

00:04:15.230 --> 00:04:17.700 
then you know smaller more scale scalar
vehicle<00:04:15.710> then<00:04:16.370> it<00:04:16.490> was<00:04:16.580> going<00:04:16.730> to<00:04:16.790> be<00:04:16.880> huge<00:04:17.240> so

00:04:17.700 --> 00:04:17.710 
vehicle then it was going to be huge so

00:04:17.710 --> 00:04:20.710 
vehicle then it was going to be huge so
but<00:04:18.710> it<00:04:18.950> needed<00:04:19.250> to<00:04:19.280> be<00:04:19.370> big<00:04:19.640> enough<00:04:19.760> and<00:04:20.150> it

00:04:20.710 --> 00:04:20.720 
but it needed to be big enough and it

00:04:20.720 --> 00:04:23.220 
but it needed to be big enough and it
need<00:04:20.870> to<00:04:20.900> be<00:04:21.020> shaped<00:04:21.440> for<00:04:21.710> you<00:04:22.310> know

00:04:23.220 --> 00:04:23.230 
need to be shaped for you know

00:04:23.230 --> 00:04:25.990 
need to be shaped for you know
accordingly<00:04:24.230> I<00:04:24.380> guess<00:04:24.740> because<00:04:25.550> I<00:04:25.730> really

00:04:25.990 --> 00:04:26.000 
accordingly I guess because I really

all been sort of top secret but you
could<00:04:48.830> put<00:04:49.010> your<00:04:49.100> b<00:04:49.250> ec<00:04:49.400> in<00:04:49.730> there<00:04:49.910> you<00:04:50.690> can

00:04:50.860 --> 00:04:50.870 
could put your b ec in there you can

00:04:50.870 --> 00:04:53.680 
could put your b ec in there you can
also<00:04:51.020> put<00:04:51.470> this<00:04:52.460> is<00:04:52.640> a<00:04:52.670> futaba<00:04:53.210> this<00:04:53.510> is<00:04:53.660> a

00:04:53.680 --> 00:04:53.690 
also put this is a futaba this is a

00:04:53.690 --> 00:04:56.350 
also put this is a futaba this is a
pretty<00:04:53.990> large<00:04:54.200> receiver<00:04:54.880> you<00:04:55.880> can<00:04:56.030> put<00:04:56.210> this

00:04:56.350 --> 00:04:56.360 
pretty large receiver you can put this

00:04:56.360 --> 00:04:59.160 
pretty large receiver you can put this
in<00:04:56.540> here<00:04:56.830> and<00:04:57.830> how<00:04:57.980> it<00:04:58.130> mounts<00:04:58.280> on<00:04:58.550> the<00:04:58.580> rate

00:04:59.160 --> 00:04:59.170 
in here and how it mounts on the rate

00:04:59.170 --> 00:05:02.590 
in here and how it mounts on the rate
this<00:05:00.170> is<00:05:00.230> so<00:05:00.590> this<00:05:00.800> is<00:05:00.980> in<00:05:01.100> the<00:05:01.220> back<00:05:01.430> so<00:05:02.390> your

00:05:02.590 --> 00:05:02.600 
this is so this is in the back so your

00:05:02.600 --> 00:05:04.210 
this is so this is in the back so your
receiver<00:05:03.020> plugs<00:05:03.350> can<00:05:03.530> cover<00:05:03.740> right<00:05:04.070> up

00:05:04.210 --> 00:05:04.220 
receiver plugs can cover right up

00:05:04.220 --> 00:05:12.220 
receiver plugs can cover right up
through<00:05:04.400> there<00:05:04.520> still<00:05:10.600> there's<00:05:11.600> an<00:05:11.750> axial

00:05:12.220 --> 00:05:12.230 
through there still there's an axial

00:05:12.230 --> 00:05:20.370 
through there still there's an axial
receiver

00:05:20.370 --> 00:05:20.380 

00:05:20.380 --> 00:05:22.760 

here's<00:05:21.010> the<00:05:21.280> stock<00:05:21.550> Wraith<00:05:21.880> light<00:05:22.240> controller

00:05:22.760 --> 00:05:22.770 
here's the stock Wraith light controller

00:05:22.770 --> 00:05:26.400 
here's the stock Wraith light controller
it<00:05:23.770> also<00:05:24.220> fits<00:05:24.490> down<00:05:24.700> there<00:05:25.120> easily<00:05:25.390> you<00:05:26.230> can

00:05:26.400 --> 00:05:26.410 
it also fits down there easily you can

00:05:26.410 --> 00:05:29.990 
it also fits down there easily you can
tuck<00:05:26.650> a<00:05:26.830> bunch<00:05:27.430> of<00:05:27.580> wire<00:05:27.790> inside<00:05:28.240> of<00:05:28.450> it<00:05:28.600> and

00:05:29.990 --> 00:05:30.000 
tuck a bunch of wire inside of it and

00:05:30.000 --> 00:05:32.070 
tuck a bunch of wire inside of it and
you'll<00:05:31.000> pretty<00:05:31.180> much<00:05:31.270> have<00:05:31.510> to<00:05:31.600> watch<00:05:31.780> how<00:05:32.020> you

00:05:32.070 --> 00:05:32.080 
you'll pretty much have to watch how you

00:05:32.080 --> 00:05:33.810 
you'll pretty much have to watch how you
mount<00:05:32.350> it<00:05:32.500> basically<00:05:33.310> you're<00:05:33.460> going<00:05:33.610> to<00:05:33.670> put

00:05:33.810 --> 00:05:33.820 
mount it basically you're going to put

00:05:33.820 --> 00:05:35.490 
mount it basically you're going to put
another<00:05:33.940> piece<00:05:34.300> inside<00:05:34.690> of<00:05:34.870> here<00:05:35.110> and<00:05:35.290> then

00:05:35.490 --> 00:05:35.500 
another piece inside of here and then

00:05:35.500 --> 00:05:37.020 
another piece inside of here and then
you<00:05:35.590> have<00:05:35.740> the<00:05:35.860> option<00:05:36.250> of<00:05:36.340> sealing<00:05:36.730> that<00:05:36.880> up

00:05:37.020 --> 00:05:37.030 
you have the option of sealing that up

00:05:37.030 --> 00:05:38.550 
you have the option of sealing that up
and<00:05:37.180> you<00:05:37.270> can<00:05:37.420> make<00:05:37.570> this<00:05:37.720> into<00:05:38.050> a<00:05:38.080> watertight

00:05:38.550 --> 00:05:38.560 
and you can make this into a watertight

00:05:38.560 --> 00:05:40.500 
and you can make this into a watertight
compartment<00:05:39.130> so<00:05:39.820> you<00:05:39.880> don't<00:05:40.090> have<00:05:40.150> to<00:05:40.330> worry

00:05:40.500 --> 00:05:40.510
