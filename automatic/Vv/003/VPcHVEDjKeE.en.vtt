00:01:12.679 --> 00:01:12.689 
again kind of make things right and I

00:01:12.689 --> 00:01:15.170 
again kind of make things right and I
think<00:01:12.750> Lance<00:01:13.080> also<00:01:13.470> wanted<00:01:13.830> to<00:01:14.010> be<00:01:14.850> part<00:01:15.119> of

00:01:15.170 --> 00:01:15.180 
think Lance also wanted to be part of

00:01:15.180 --> 00:01:18.590 
think Lance also wanted to be part of
the<00:01:15.299> ongoing<00:01:15.479> story<00:01:16.020> I<00:01:17.240> certainly<00:01:18.240> was<00:01:18.570> very

00:01:18.590 --> 00:01:18.600 
the ongoing story I certainly was very

00:01:18.600 --> 00:01:20.810 
the ongoing story I certainly was very
confident<00:01:19.530> that<00:01:19.680> I<00:01:19.740> would<00:01:19.860> never<00:01:20.100> be<00:01:20.369> caught<00:01:20.400> I

00:01:20.810 --> 00:01:20.820 
confident that I would never be caught I

00:01:20.820 --> 00:01:22.910 
confident that I would never be caught I
think<00:01:21.299> it<00:01:21.509> tested<00:01:21.900> me<00:01:21.990> and<00:01:22.229> the<00:01:22.290> reason<00:01:22.590> I<00:01:22.680> put

00:01:22.910 --> 00:01:22.920 
think it tested me and the reason I put

00:01:22.920 --> 00:01:24.320 
think it tested me and the reason I put
myself<00:01:23.100> in<00:01:23.520> the<00:01:23.610> film<00:01:23.820> because<00:01:23.939> it's<00:01:24.180> really

00:01:24.320 --> 00:01:24.330 
myself in the film because it's really

00:01:24.330 --> 00:01:27.410 
myself in the film because it's really
in<00:01:24.960> a<00:01:25.049> way<00:01:25.080> this<00:01:25.530> film<00:01:25.799> is<00:01:25.950> part<00:01:26.159> of<00:01:26.340> is<00:01:26.880> my

00:01:27.410 --> 00:01:27.420 
in a way this film is part of is my

00:01:27.420 --> 00:01:30.530 
in a way this film is part of is my
story<00:01:28.670> because<00:01:29.670> I<00:01:29.759> realized<00:01:30.119> at<00:01:30.240> some<00:01:30.270> point

00:01:30.530 --> 00:01:30.540 
story because I realized at some point

00:01:30.540 --> 00:01:33.260 
story because I realized at some point
particularly<00:01:31.500> when<00:01:31.710> Lance's<00:01:32.670> story<00:01:32.850> finally

00:01:33.260 --> 00:01:33.270 
particularly when Lance's story finally

00:01:33.270 --> 00:01:35.569 
particularly when Lance's story finally
became<00:01:33.650> unbelievable<00:01:34.650> I<00:01:34.860> realized<00:01:35.400> that

00:01:35.569 --> 00:01:35.579 
became unbelievable I realized that

00:01:35.579 --> 00:01:39.830 
became unbelievable I realized that
actually<00:01:35.729> I<00:01:36.119> had<00:01:36.509> been<00:01:36.780> a<00:01:37.310> cog<00:01:38.310> in<00:01:38.700> a<00:01:39.000> great<00:01:39.270> PR

00:01:39.830 --> 00:01:39.840 
actually I had been a cog in a great PR

00:01:39.840 --> 00:01:43.280 
actually I had been a cog in a great PR
machine<00:01:40.170> I<00:01:40.650> was<00:01:40.950> part<00:01:41.250> of<00:01:41.340> a<00:01:41.430> con<00:01:41.670> and<00:01:42.060> I<00:01:43.049> had<00:01:43.200> to

00:01:43.280 --> 00:01:43.290 
machine I was part of a con and I had to

00:01:43.290 --> 00:01:46.130 
machine I was part of a con and I had to
go<00:01:43.409> back<00:01:43.560> and<00:01:43.619> re-examine<00:01:44.009> my<00:01:44.460> own<00:01:44.729> role<00:01:45.140> and

00:01:46.130 --> 00:01:46.140 
go back and re-examine my own role and

00:01:46.140 --> 00:01:47.719 
go back and re-examine my own role and
that<00:01:46.170> I<00:01:46.409> think<00:01:46.560> makes<00:01:46.829> this<00:01:47.130> film<00:01:47.490> a<00:01:47.579> bit

00:01:47.719 --> 00:01:47.729 
that I think makes this film a bit

00:01:47.729 --> 00:01:49.249 
that I think makes this film a bit
different<00:01:48.090> than<00:01:48.360> some<00:01:48.720> of<00:01:48.810> the<00:01:48.869> stuff<00:01:49.110> I've

00:01:49.249 --> 00:01:49.259 
different than some of the stuff I've

00:01:49.259 --> 00:01:51.020 
different than some of the stuff I've
done<00:01:49.290> before<00:01:49.829> and<00:01:50.040> I<00:01:50.130> had<00:01:50.250> to<00:01:50.369> reexamine<00:01:50.610> my

00:01:51.020 --> 00:01:51.030 
done before and I had to reexamine my

00:01:51.030 --> 00:01:53.060 
done before and I had to reexamine my
relationship<00:01:51.570> with<00:01:51.720> Lance<00:01:51.899> and<00:01:52.200> we<00:01:52.829> had<00:01:52.979> to

00:01:53.060 --> 00:01:53.070 
relationship with Lance and we had to

00:01:53.070 --> 00:01:56.890 
relationship with Lance and we had to
get<00:01:53.189> a<00:01:53.220> bit<00:01:53.430> more<00:01:53.549> honest
