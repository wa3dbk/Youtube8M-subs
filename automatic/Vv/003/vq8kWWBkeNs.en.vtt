about<00:00:56.280> seven<00:00:56.670> or<00:00:56.730> eight<00:00:56.850> days<00:00:57.059> into<00:00:57.600> taking

00:00:57.799 --> 00:00:57.809 
about seven or eight days into taking

00:00:57.809 --> 00:01:01.760 
about seven or eight days into taking
the<00:00:57.960> HCG<00:00:58.590> well<00:00:59.070> let<00:00:59.160> me<00:00:59.219> first<00:00:59.250> say<00:00:59.750> that<00:01:00.770> when

00:01:01.760 --> 00:01:01.770 
the HCG well let me first say that when

00:01:01.770 --> 00:01:04.340 
the HCG well let me first say that when
I<00:01:01.800> first<00:01:02.070> mixed<00:01:02.520> the<00:01:02.640> first<00:01:02.850> batch<00:01:03.120> of<00:01:03.390> HCG<00:01:03.960> I

00:01:04.340 --> 00:01:04.350 
I first mixed the first batch of HCG I

00:01:04.350 --> 00:01:07.310 
I first mixed the first batch of HCG I
tested<00:01:05.220> it<00:01:05.309> on<00:01:05.580> a<00:01:05.700> pregnancy<00:01:06.630> test<00:01:06.810> and<00:01:07.080> it<00:01:07.229> was

00:01:07.310 --> 00:01:07.320 
tested it on a pregnancy test and it was

00:01:07.320 --> 00:01:11.090 
tested it on a pregnancy test and it was
positive<00:01:08.330> about<00:01:09.330> seven<00:01:09.780> or<00:01:09.869> eight<00:01:10.080> days<00:01:10.409> eight

00:01:11.090 --> 00:01:11.100 
positive about seven or eight days eight

00:01:11.100 --> 00:01:13.880 
positive about seven or eight days eight
or<00:01:11.250> nine<00:01:11.400> days<00:01:11.580> into<00:01:11.610> the<00:01:12.150> protocol<00:01:12.630> I<00:01:12.890> noticed

00:01:13.880 --> 00:01:13.890 
or nine days into the protocol I noticed

00:01:13.890 --> 00:01:15.200 
or nine days into the protocol I noticed
that<00:01:13.979> I<00:01:14.070> was<00:01:14.159> losing<00:01:14.490> some<00:01:14.909> of<00:01:14.939> the<00:01:15.060> benefits

00:01:15.200 --> 00:01:15.210 
that I was losing some of the benefits

00:01:15.210 --> 00:01:20.090 
that I was losing some of the benefits
of<00:01:15.750> the<00:01:16.140> HCG<00:01:16.710> that<00:01:17.100> I<00:01:17.420> previously<00:01:18.420> had<00:01:19.040> so<00:01:20.040> I

00:01:20.090 --> 00:01:20.100 
of the HCG that I previously had so I

00:01:20.100 --> 00:01:21.770 
of the HCG that I previously had so I
went<00:01:20.310> out<00:01:20.460> and<00:01:20.490> got<00:01:20.700> another<00:01:21.030> pregnancy<00:01:21.450> test

00:01:21.770 --> 00:01:21.780 
went out and got another pregnancy test

00:01:21.780 --> 00:01:25.179 
went out and got another pregnancy test
and<00:01:22.049> I<00:01:22.200> tested<00:01:22.680> the<00:01:22.799> HCG<00:01:23.310> and<00:01:23.520> it<00:01:23.880> was<00:01:24.119> negative

00:01:25.179 --> 00:01:25.189 
and I tested the HCG and it was negative

00:01:25.189 --> 00:01:28.780 
and I tested the HCG and it was negative
and<00:01:26.189> needless<00:01:27.150> to<00:01:27.240> say<00:01:27.390> I<00:01:27.540> was<00:01:27.600> kind<00:01:27.869> of<00:01:27.900> upset

00:01:28.780 --> 00:01:28.790 
and needless to say I was kind of upset

00:01:28.790 --> 00:01:32.749 
and needless to say I was kind of upset
anyway<00:01:30.110> so<00:01:31.110> did<00:01:31.290> work<00:01:31.439> at<00:01:31.590> first<00:01:31.860> and<00:01:32.250> about

00:01:32.749 --> 00:01:32.759 
anyway so did work at first and about

00:01:32.759 --> 00:01:36.890 
anyway so did work at first and about
seven<00:01:33.119> to<00:01:33.750> nine<00:01:33.900> days<00:01:34.170> in<00:01:34.409> it<00:01:35.220> was<00:01:35.490> dead<00:01:35.900> at

00:01:36.890 --> 00:01:36.900 
seven to nine days in it was dead at

00:01:36.900 --> 00:01:42.310 
seven to nine days in it was dead at
that<00:01:36.960> point<00:01:37.259> t<00:01:38.130> om<00:01:38.810> wasn't<00:01:39.810> very<00:01:40.170> far<00:01:40.710> away<00:01:41.009> and

00:01:42.310 --> 00:01:42.320 
that point t om wasn't very far away and

00:01:42.320 --> 00:01:45.380 
that point t om wasn't very far away and
considering<00:01:43.320> how<00:01:43.560> expensive<00:01:43.860> HGG<00:01:44.820> is<00:01:45.060> I

00:01:45.380 --> 00:01:45.390 
considering how expensive HGG is I

00:01:45.390 --> 00:01:46.910 
considering how expensive HGG is I
didn't<00:01:45.780> want<00:01:45.899> to<00:01:45.990> mix<00:01:46.110> a<00:01:46.229> whole<00:01:46.380> new<00:01:46.470> batch<00:01:46.680> and

00:01:46.910 --> 00:01:46.920 
didn't want to mix a whole new batch and

00:01:46.920 --> 00:01:48.950 
didn't want to mix a whole new batch and
have<00:01:47.070> a<00:01:47.100> go<00:01:47.280> bad<00:01:47.520> again<00:01:47.549> in<00:01:48.060> seven<00:01:48.600> to<00:01:48.810> nine

00:01:48.950 --> 00:01:48.960 
have a go bad again in seven to nine

00:01:48.960 --> 00:01:52.219 
have a go bad again in seven to nine
days<00:01:49.200> and<00:01:49.590> not<00:01:50.040> even<00:01:50.250> be<00:01:50.340> able<00:01:50.399> to<00:01:50.490> use<00:01:50.729> it<00:01:50.759> so<00:01:51.229> I

00:01:52.219 --> 00:01:52.229 
days and not even be able to use it so I

00:01:52.229 --> 00:01:57.560 
days and not even be able to use it so I
went<00:01:53.220> out<00:01:53.340> on<00:01:53.490> a<00:01:53.610> limb<00:01:53.640> and<00:01:55.460> decided<00:01:56.460> to<00:01:56.729> not<00:01:57.119> do

00:01:57.560 --> 00:01:57.570 
went out on a limb and decided to not do

00:01:57.570 --> 00:02:02.240 
went out on a limb and decided to not do
injections<00:01:57.960> until<00:01:58.920> t<00:01:59.399> om<00:01:59.790> was<00:02:00.509> gone<00:02:01.250> which

00:02:02.240 --> 00:02:02.250 
injections until t om was gone which

00:02:02.250 --> 00:02:05.120 
injections until t om was gone which
took<00:02:02.460> a<00:02:02.579> long<00:02:02.729> time<00:02:02.759> by<00:02:03.090> the<00:02:03.180> way<00:02:03.439> anyway<00:02:04.439> there

00:02:05.120 --> 00:02:05.130 
took a long time by the way anyway there

00:02:05.130 --> 00:02:06.770 
took a long time by the way anyway there
was<00:02:05.189> approximately<00:02:05.430> if<00:02:06.240> you<00:02:06.329> count<00:02:06.540> the<00:02:06.630> days

00:02:06.770 --> 00:02:06.780 
was approximately if you count the days

00:02:06.780 --> 00:02:09.190 
was approximately if you count the days
that<00:02:06.840> i<00:02:07.170> was<00:02:07.320> injecting<00:02:07.950> dead<00:02:08.310> HCG

00:02:09.190 --> 00:02:09.200 
that i was injecting dead HCG

00:02:09.200 --> 00:02:11.510 
that i was injecting dead HCG
approximately<00:02:10.200> 14<00:02:10.679> to<00:02:10.800> 18<00:02:10.830> days

00:02:11.510 --> 00:02:11.520 
approximately 14 to 18 days

00:02:11.520 --> 00:02:14.600 
approximately 14 to 18 days
I was<00:02:12.000> completely<00:02:12.150> off<00:02:13.220> HGG<00:02:14.220> and<00:02:14.490> I

00:02:14.600 --> 00:02:14.610 
I was completely off HGG and I

00:02:14.610 --> 00:02:16.490 
I was completely off HGG and I
maintained<00:02:15.240> my<00:02:15.450> weight<00:02:15.630> loss<00:02:15.810> during<00:02:16.260> that

00:02:43.280 --> 00:02:43.290 
able to keep it off which was a big deal

00:02:43.290 --> 00:02:48.920 
able to keep it off which was a big deal
to<00:02:43.370> so<00:02:44.420> out<00:02:45.420> of<00:02:45.510> the<00:02:45.810> last<00:02:46.160> month<00:02:47.160> and<00:02:47.930> four

00:02:48.920 --> 00:02:48.930 
to so out of the last month and four

00:02:48.930 --> 00:02:52.580 
to so out of the last month and four
days<00:02:50.150> approximately<00:02:51.150> 14<00:02:51.630> to<00:02:51.840> 18<00:02:51.870> of<00:02:52.290> those

00:02:52.580 --> 00:02:52.590 
days approximately 14 to 18 of those

00:02:52.590 --> 00:02:59.840 
days approximately 14 to 18 of those
days<00:02:52.890> I<00:02:53.360> had<00:02:54.360> no<00:02:54.660> HGG<00:02:55.910> yet<00:02:56.910> i<00:02:57.920> have<00:02:58.920> lost<00:02:59.100> 26<00:02:59.700> and

00:02:59.840 --> 00:02:59.850 
days I had no HGG yet i have lost 26 and

00:02:59.850 --> 00:03:03.770 
days I had no HGG yet i have lost 26 and
a<00:02:59.910> half<00:03:00.060> pounds<00:03:00.920> so<00:03:01.920> my<00:03:02.310> estimate<00:03:02.880> is<00:03:03.120> had<00:03:03.750> I

00:03:03.770 --> 00:03:03.780 
a half pounds so my estimate is had I

00:03:03.780 --> 00:03:06.770 
a half pounds so my estimate is had I
stayed<00:03:03.960> on<00:03:04.410> the<00:03:05.160> entire<00:03:05.460> time<00:03:05.790> up<00:03:06.120> until<00:03:06.450> now<00:03:06.660> i

00:03:06.770 --> 00:03:06.780 
stayed on the entire time up until now i

00:03:06.780 --> 00:03:09.320 
stayed on the entire time up until now i
think<00:03:07.080> i<00:03:07.140> would<00:03:07.290> have<00:03:07.410> lost<00:03:07.620> anywhere<00:03:08.220> from<00:03:09.060> 30

00:03:09.320 --> 00:03:09.330 
think i would have lost anywhere from 30

00:03:09.330 --> 00:03:13.010 
think i would have lost anywhere from 30
to<00:03:09.420> 35<00:03:09.900> pounds<00:03:10.440> on<00:03:11.400> my<00:03:11.670> first<00:03:11.940> month<00:03:12.240> of<00:03:12.450> HCG

00:03:13.010 --> 00:03:13.020 
to 35 pounds on my first month of HCG

00:03:13.020 --> 00:03:15.800 
to 35 pounds on my first month of HCG

and that's pretty significant to me i'm
pretty<00:03:16.020> impressed<00:03:16.770> with<00:03:17.190> that<00:03:17.280> and<00:03:17.700> like<00:03:18.390> i

really cold like a lot I guess that's

00:04:24.650 --> 00:04:27.310
