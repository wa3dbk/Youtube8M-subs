ope<00:00:52.620> I<00:00:52.710> don't<00:00:52.920> know<00:00:53.039> whether<00:00:53.280> it's<00:00:53.850> because

00:00:54.970 --> 00:00:54.980 
ope I don't know whether it's because

00:00:54.980 --> 00:00:56.840 
ope I don't know whether it's because
something<00:00:55.980> to<00:00:56.190> do<00:00:56.309> with<00:00:56.430> the<00:00:56.550> grenade

00:00:56.840 --> 00:00:56.850 
something to do with the grenade

00:00:56.850 --> 00:00:59.689 
something to do with the grenade
launcher<00:00:57.210> attachment<00:00:57.780> or<00:00:57.989> whatever<00:00:58.530> but<00:00:59.370> it's

00:00:59.689 --> 00:00:59.699 
launcher attachment or whatever but it's

00:00:59.699 --> 00:01:02.750 
launcher attachment or whatever but it's
it<00:01:00.210> makes<00:01:00.420> the<00:01:00.660> the<00:01:01.050> rate<00:01:01.230> of<00:01:01.379> fire<00:01:01.559> insane

00:01:02.750 --> 00:01:02.760 
it makes the the rate of fire insane

00:01:02.760 --> 00:01:04.700 
it makes the the rate of fire insane
I<00:01:02.789> can<00:01:03.149> only<00:01:03.300> imagine<00:01:03.449> if<00:01:03.899> you<00:01:04.110> you<00:01:04.470> put<00:01:04.680> a

00:01:04.700 --> 00:01:04.710 
I can only imagine if you you put a

00:01:04.710 --> 00:01:06.590 
I can only imagine if you you put a
rapid<00:01:05.129> fire<00:01:05.309> on<00:01:05.549> this<00:01:05.670> how<00:01:05.909> crazy<00:01:06.180> it<00:01:06.360> would<00:01:06.479> be

00:01:06.590 --> 00:01:06.600 
rapid fire on this how crazy it would be

00:01:06.600 --> 00:01:10.030 
rapid fire on this how crazy it would be
but<00:01:07.310> pretty<00:01:08.310> much<00:01:08.369> one<00:01:08.729> on<00:01:08.760> one<00:01:08.880> you<00:01:09.090> can

00:01:10.030 --> 00:01:10.040 
but pretty much one on one you can

00:01:10.040 --> 00:01:14.660 
but pretty much one on one you can
outshoot<00:01:11.040> anybody<00:01:11.580> if<00:01:11.820> you're<00:01:12.229> within<00:01:13.670> you

00:01:14.660 --> 00:01:14.670 
outshoot anybody if you're within you

00:01:14.670 --> 00:01:16.550 
outshoot anybody if you're within you
know<00:01:14.790> if<00:01:15.060> you<00:01:15.509> get<00:01:15.630> the<00:01:15.750> shot<00:01:15.930> off<00:01:15.990> first<00:01:16.380> year

00:01:16.550 --> 00:01:16.560

they're<00:01:16.799> done<00:01:16.979> you<00:01:17.400> know<00:01:17.490> regardless<00:01:18.030> of<00:01:18.270> what

00:01:18.410 --> 00:01:18.420 
they're done you know regardless of what

00:02:25.130 --> 00:02:25.140 
gun and level up a different gun this is

00:02:25.140 --> 00:02:28.160 
gun and level up a different gun this is
a<00:02:25.260> good<00:02:25.590> good<00:02:26.010> place<00:02:26.220> to<00:02:26.370> look<00:02:26.580> I<00:02:26.819> think<00:02:27.270> this

00:02:28.160 --> 00:02:28.170 
a good good place to look I think this

00:02:28.170 --> 00:02:31.870 
a good good place to look I think this
was<00:02:28.410> mine<00:02:28.680> maybe<00:02:29.130> I<00:02:30.020> want<00:02:31.020> to<00:02:31.050> say<00:02:31.170> second<00:02:31.530> game

using<00:02:32.880> this<00:02:33.030> setup<00:02:33.330> I<00:02:34.190> think<00:02:35.190> you<00:02:35.250> have<00:02:35.370> to

00:02:35.449 --> 00:02:35.459 
using this setup I think you have to

00:02:35.459 --> 00:02:36.979 
using this setup I think you have to
have<00:02:35.580> it<00:02:35.700> at<00:02:35.790> level<00:02:35.970> 8<00:02:36.300> before<00:02:36.569> you<00:02:36.750> get<00:02:36.870> the

00:02:36.979 --> 00:02:36.989 
have it at level 8 before you get the

00:02:36.989 --> 00:02:39.350 
have it at level 8 before you get the
grenade<00:02:37.260> launcher<00:02:37.290> attachment<00:02:38.180> but<00:02:39.180> that's

00:02:39.350 --> 00:02:39.360 
grenade launcher attachment but that's

00:02:39.360 --> 00:02:40.790 
grenade launcher attachment but that's
when<00:02:39.540> it<00:02:39.630> starts<00:02:39.870> getting<00:02:39.930> crazy<00:02:40.140> before<00:02:40.500> that

00:02:40.790 --> 00:02:40.800 
when it starts getting crazy before that

00:02:40.800 --> 00:02:42.500 
when it starts getting crazy before that
I<00:02:40.830> hated<00:02:41.250> the<00:02:41.459> gun<00:02:41.610> I<00:02:41.640> didn't<00:02:41.970> like<00:02:42.060> using<00:02:42.270> it
