00:00:11.419 --> 00:00:16.270
 optical supports for English in this field from decided to invest when in the 

00:00:16.269 --> 00:00:19.430
 1996 obtained entrepreneurial financing 

00:00:20.240 --> 00:00:25.150
 I leave so the only company that from Naples in the jury of the cd + dvd is found 

00:00:25.150 --> 00:00:27.220
 dorso massa in the province of cosenza 

00:00:27.220 --> 00:00:32.160
 a18 employees for an annual turnover of around 3 million euro proceeding 

00:00:32.160 --> 00:00:37.399
 the creations of these magnetic supports are technologically advanced and in 1982 

00:00:37.399 --> 00:00:40.379
 with the first cd cover designed by filesonic 

00:00:40.379 --> 00:00:45.469
 have cashed the vinyl the unit 7 and here we receive the information clouds 

00:00:45.469 --> 00:00:47.810
 free mendel masks of piedmont 

00:00:47.810 --> 00:00:51.010
 which we then upload to our servers 

00:00:51.010 --> 00:00:54.650
 and subsequently the information content of the master will be transferred 

00:00:54.650 --> 00:00:59.740
 on a glass disk called master class a from the matrix you pass to the phase 

00:00:59.740 --> 00:01:00.970
 of reply 

00:01:00.970 --> 00:01:04.920
 this net disk is inserted in a galvanic or michele bath 

00:01:04.920 --> 00:01:08.850
 it settles on adel michele, creating a thickness 

00:01:09.930 --> 00:01:11.350
 so a record of 

00:01:11.350 --> 00:01:15.720
 d of michele that always agrees to inform our master 

00:01:15.720 --> 00:01:18.720
 revenge to be used as a matrix for 

00:01:19.610 --> 00:01:23.060
 to replicate to print and subsequently list in polycarbonate 

00:01:23.620 --> 00:01:27.700
 polycarbonate is the raw material from which the swans are made 

00:01:27.700 --> 00:01:30.700
 let's start with plastic in polycarbonate chips 

00:01:31.240 --> 00:01:36.890
 federica in the finished disc jen I'm decided ready to be packaged 

00:01:36.890 --> 00:01:38.920
 but what is the difference between 5 

00:01:38.920 --> 00:01:40.630
 common ombudsman 

00:01:40.630 --> 00:01:43.770
 should enter the market and replace old support 

00:01:44.430 --> 00:01:48.670
 the essential difference between cd and dvd ftp consists of two disks 

00:01:48.670 --> 00:01:50.010
 glued together 

00:01:50.010 --> 00:01:52.200
 and to make just one 

00:01:52.200 --> 00:01:55.659
 therefore capacity the greater capacity than says of 

00:01:55.659 --> 00:01:59.729
 this is why it can contain training institutions and therefore films 

00:01:59.729 --> 00:02:03.070
 or computer data with you also to you 

00:02:03.070 --> 00:02:05.119
 the target of the Calabrian company 

00:02:05.119 --> 00:02:08.629
 private public bodies publishing record companies 

00:02:08.629 --> 00:02:09.430
