normal<00:03:00.030> mascara<00:03:00.450> so<00:03:01.379> I'm<00:03:01.469> just<00:03:01.620> going<00:03:01.739> to<00:03:01.829> curl

00:03:01.970 --> 00:03:01.980 
normal mascara so I'm just going to curl

00:03:01.980 --> 00:03:04.819 
normal mascara so I'm just going to curl
my<00:03:02.040> lashes<00:03:02.189> and<00:03:02.849> apply<00:03:03.030> a<00:03:03.299> layer<00:03:03.629> of<00:03:03.930> the

00:03:04.819 --> 00:03:04.829

00:03:12.410 --> 00:03:12.420 

00:03:12.420 --> 00:03:14.960 

I<00:03:12.510> really<00:03:13.200> like<00:03:13.319> the<00:03:13.590> bristles<00:03:14.040> in<00:03:14.280> this<00:03:14.640> and

00:03:14.960 --> 00:03:14.970 
I really like the bristles in this and

00:03:14.970 --> 00:03:17.809 
I really like the bristles in this and
mascara<00:03:15.720> brush<00:03:16.080> because<00:03:16.950> it<00:03:17.280> really<00:03:17.520> like

00:03:17.809 --> 00:03:17.819 
mascara brush because it really like

00:03:17.819 --> 00:03:20.660 
mascara brush because it really like
gets<00:03:18.060> the<00:03:18.239> corners<00:03:18.750> and<00:03:19.260> inner<00:03:20.190> corners<00:03:20.520> and

00:03:20.660 --> 00:03:20.670 
gets the corners and inner corners and

00:03:20.670 --> 00:03:22.430 
gets the corners and inner corners and
outer<00:03:20.849> corners<00:03:21.450> which<00:03:21.720> are<00:03:21.870> really<00:03:22.080> hard<00:03:22.319> to

00:03:22.430 --> 00:03:22.440 
outer corners which are really hard to

00:03:22.440 --> 00:03:43.290 
outer corners which are really hard to
reach

00:03:43.290 --> 00:03:43.300 

00:03:43.300 --> 00:03:45.570 

ok<00:03:43.960> so<00:03:44.020> I've<00:03:44.230> applied<00:03:44.500> a<00:03:44.800> single<00:03:45.220> layer<00:03:45.370> of

00:03:45.570 --> 00:03:45.580 
ok so I've applied a single layer of

00:03:45.580 --> 00:03:48.060 
ok so I've applied a single layer of
mascara<00:03:45.790> on<00:03:46.180> both<00:03:46.510> sides<00:03:46.840> I'm<00:03:47.560> going<00:03:47.740> to<00:03:47.830> start

00:03:48.060 --> 00:03:48.070 
mascara on both sides I'm going to start

00:03:48.070 --> 00:03:50.550 
mascara on both sides I'm going to start
with<00:03:48.310> the<00:03:48.460> transplant<00:03:49.030> gel<00:03:49.360> and<00:03:49.630> going<00:03:50.500> to

00:03:50.550 --> 00:03:50.560 
with the transplant gel and going to

00:03:50.560 --> 00:03:54.060 
with the transplant gel and going to
apply<00:03:50.710> a<00:03:50.770> single<00:03:51.190> layer<00:03:51.310> of<00:03:51.340> that<00:03:51.880> I<00:03:52.950> find<00:03:53.950> it

00:03:54.060 --> 00:03:54.070 
apply a single layer of that I find it

00:03:54.070 --> 00:03:55.860 
apply a single layer of that I find it
applies<00:03:54.370> there<00:03:54.700> and<00:03:55.030> it's<00:03:55.180> easier<00:03:55.600> to<00:03:55.720> work

00:03:55.860 --> 00:03:55.870 
applies there and it's easier to work

00:03:55.870 --> 00:03:59.280 
applies there and it's easier to work
with<00:03:55.930> while<00:03:56.560> and<00:03:57.000> the<00:03:58.000> mascara<00:03:58.570> the<00:03:58.870> original

00:03:59.280 --> 00:03:59.290 
with while and the mascara the original

00:03:59.290 --> 00:04:02.460 
with while and the mascara the original
mascara<00:03:59.680> is<00:03:59.830> still<00:04:00.130> slightly<00:04:00.700> wet<00:04:01.180> so<00:04:02.080> as<00:04:02.320> soon

00:04:02.460 --> 00:04:02.470 
mascara is still slightly wet so as soon

00:04:02.470 --> 00:04:04.020 
mascara is still slightly wet so as soon
as<00:04:02.560> you<00:04:02.680> apply<00:04:02.890> layer<00:04:03.160> of<00:04:03.280> that<00:04:03.490> style<00:04:03.820> the

00:04:04.020 --> 00:04:04.030 
as you apply layer of that style the

00:04:04.030 --> 00:04:06.510 
as you apply layer of that style the
transplant<00:04:04.540> gel<00:04:04.810> now<00:04:05.620> i'm<00:04:05.800> going<00:04:05.980> to<00:04:06.040> use<00:04:06.310> the

00:04:06.510 --> 00:04:06.520 
transplant gel now i'm going to use the

00:04:06.520 --> 00:04:09.330 
transplant gel now i'm going to use the
natural<00:04:06.790> fibers<00:04:07.480> and<00:04:08.130> apply<00:04:09.130> that

00:04:09.330 --> 00:04:09.340 
natural fibers and apply that

00:04:09.340 --> 00:04:11.730 
natural fibers and apply that
straightaway<00:04:10.030> is<00:04:10.300> really<00:04:11.020> fun<00:04:11.230> to<00:04:11.380> apply<00:04:11.590> as

00:04:11.730 --> 00:04:11.740 
straightaway is really fun to apply as

00:04:11.740 --> 00:04:13.500 
straightaway is really fun to apply as
well<00:04:11.920> you<00:04:12.070> can<00:04:12.100> really<00:04:12.430> see<00:04:12.790> the<00:04:13.030> fibers

00:04:13.500 --> 00:04:13.510 
well you can really see the fibers

00:04:13.510 --> 00:04:16.490 
well you can really see the fibers
sticking<00:04:14.110> and<00:04:14.500> this<00:04:15.340> sort<00:04:15.580> of<00:04:15.610> like<00:04:15.790> build<00:04:16.120> up

00:04:16.490 --> 00:04:16.500 
sticking and this sort of like build up

00:04:16.500 --> 00:04:20.490 
sticking and this sort of like build up
layer<00:04:17.500> after<00:04:17.920> layer<00:04:18.130> so<00:04:18.850> they<00:04:19.120> lengthen<00:04:19.510> your

00:04:20.490 --> 00:04:20.500 
layer after layer so they lengthen your

00:04:20.500 --> 00:04:23.190 
layer after layer so they lengthen your
lashes<00:04:20.709> and<00:04:21.340> they<00:04:21.880> add<00:04:22.060> more<00:04:22.390> volume<00:04:22.600> because

00:04:23.190 --> 00:04:23.200 
lashes and they add more volume because

00:04:23.200 --> 00:04:28.119 
lashes and they add more volume because
it<00:04:23.380> thickens<00:04:23.860> them<00:04:24.070> as<00:04:24.220> well

00:04:28.119 --> 00:04:28.129 

00:04:28.129 --> 00:04:31.159 

okay<00:04:29.129> i<00:04:29.159> find<00:04:29.460> this<00:04:29.969> works<00:04:30.360> best<00:04:30.719> if<00:04:30.990> you

00:04:31.159 --> 00:04:31.169 
okay i find this works best if you

00:04:31.169 --> 00:04:33.200 
okay i find this works best if you
repeat<00:04:31.620> the<00:04:31.710> process<00:04:31.889> twice<00:04:32.370> so<00:04:32.699> now<00:04:32.909> i'm

00:04:33.200 --> 00:04:33.210 
repeat the process twice so now i'm

00:04:33.210 --> 00:04:35.899 
repeat the process twice so now i'm
adding<00:04:33.539> the<00:04:34.229> transplant<00:04:34.800> gel<00:04:35.039> to<00:04:35.280> seal<00:04:35.610> in<00:04:35.849> the

00:04:35.899 --> 00:04:35.909 
adding the transplant gel to seal in the

00:04:35.909 --> 00:04:37.939 
adding the transplant gel to seal in the
fibers<00:04:36.780> because<00:04:37.050> you<00:04:37.169> really<00:04:37.439> do<00:04:37.650> need<00:04:37.800> to

00:04:37.939 --> 00:04:37.949 
fibers because you really do need to

00:04:37.949 --> 00:04:39.290 
fibers because you really do need to
seal<00:04:38.189> them<00:04:38.340> in<00:04:38.460> otherwise<00:04:39.030> they're<00:04:39.270> just

00:04:39.290 --> 00:04:39.300 
seal them in otherwise they're just

00:04:39.300 --> 00:04:41.719 
seal them in otherwise they're just
going<00:04:39.840> to<00:04:39.930> literally<00:04:40.259> go<00:04:40.560> everywhere<00:04:40.979> so<00:04:41.639> i'm

00:04:41.719 --> 00:04:41.729 
going to literally go everywhere so i'm

00:04:41.729 --> 00:04:43.730 
going to literally go everywhere so i'm
going<00:04:41.879> to<00:04:41.939> add<00:04:42.330> a<00:04:42.389> layout<00:04:42.750> to<00:04:43.139> seal<00:04:43.590> everything

00:04:43.730 --> 00:04:43.740 
going to add a layout to seal everything

00:04:43.740 --> 00:04:46.909 
going to add a layout to seal everything
in<00:04:44.250> and<00:04:44.580> again<00:04:45.150> i'm<00:04:45.449> adding<00:04:46.229> the<00:04:46.379> natural

00:04:46.909 --> 00:04:46.919 
in and again i'm adding the natural

00:04:46.919 --> 00:04:49.999 
in and again i'm adding the natural
fibers<00:04:47.520> like<00:04:47.900> i<00:04:48.900> said<00:04:49.139> this<00:04:49.259> is<00:04:49.379> my<00:04:49.560> second

00:04:49.999 --> 00:04:50.009 
fibers like i said this is my second

00:04:50.009 --> 00:04:53.450 
fibers like i said this is my second
layer<00:04:50.159> and<00:04:50.780> you<00:04:51.780> can't<00:04:52.020> I<00:04:52.199> don't<00:04:52.590> know<00:04:52.770> after<00:04:53.219> I

00:04:53.450 --> 00:04:53.460 
layer and you can't I don't know after I

00:04:53.460 --> 00:04:55.580 
layer and you can't I don't know after I
think<00:04:53.849> after<00:04:54.030> the<00:04:54.389> second<00:04:54.810> 1i<00:04:54.960> hot<00:04:55.229> really<00:04:55.409> do
