00:00:02.030 --> 00:00:02.040 
hey guys welcome to another mod review

00:00:02.040 --> 00:00:04.809 
hey guys welcome to another mod review
this<00:00:02.250> is<00:00:02.550> the<00:00:03.120> mine<00:00:03.659> shop<00:00:03.959> mod<00:00:04.170> made<00:00:04.620> by

00:00:04.809 --> 00:00:04.819 
this is the mine shop mod made by

00:00:04.819 --> 00:00:07.810 
this is the mine shop mod made by
barracuda<00:00:05.819> ATA<00:00:06.330> i<00:00:06.600> think<00:00:07.109> that's<00:00:07.319> his<00:00:07.500> name

00:00:07.810 --> 00:00:07.820 
barracuda ATA i think that's his name

00:00:07.820 --> 00:00:10.129 
barracuda ATA i think that's his name
but<00:00:08.820> anyways<00:00:09.030> this<00:00:09.269> mod<00:00:09.570> lets<00:00:09.809> you<00:00:09.900> take

00:00:10.129 --> 00:00:10.139 
but anyways this mod lets you take

00:00:10.139 --> 00:00:12.230 
but anyways this mod lets you take
really<00:00:10.740> really<00:00:11.130> really<00:00:11.340> high<00:00:11.639> resolution

00:00:12.230 --> 00:00:12.240 
really really really high resolution

00:00:12.240 --> 00:00:14.120 
really really really high resolution
screen<00:00:12.269> shots<00:00:12.750> so<00:00:13.290> instead<00:00:13.679> of<00:00:13.740> being<00:00:13.950> stuck

00:00:14.120 --> 00:00:14.130 
screen shots so instead of being stuck

00:00:14.130 --> 00:00:16.340 
screen shots so instead of being stuck
to<00:00:14.490> something<00:00:14.880> like<00:00:15.089> 720<00:00:15.570> p<00:00:15.719> which<00:00:15.900> is<00:00:16.080> what

00:00:16.340 --> 00:00:16.350 
to something like 720 p which is what

00:00:16.350 --> 00:00:18.200 
to something like 720 p which is what
i'm<00:00:16.500> recording<00:00:16.980> on<00:00:17.100> right<00:00:17.250> now<00:00:17.279> you<00:00:17.940> could

00:00:18.200 --> 00:00:18.210 
i'm recording on right now you could

00:00:18.210 --> 00:00:20.929 
i'm recording on right now you could
take<00:00:18.600> pictures<00:00:19.410> that<00:00:19.590> are<00:00:19.800> like<00:00:20.250> 16<00:00:20.910> times

00:00:20.929 --> 00:00:20.939 
take pictures that are like 16 times

00:00:20.939 --> 00:00:23.540 
take pictures that are like 16 times
high<00:00:21.720> resolution<00:00:22.320> than<00:00:22.439> that<00:00:22.619> so<00:00:23.130> pretty<00:00:23.460> much

00:00:23.540 --> 00:00:23.550 
high resolution than that so pretty much

00:00:23.550 --> 00:00:25.970 
high resolution than that so pretty much
it's<00:00:24.029> really<00:00:24.539> good<00:00:24.689> for<00:00:24.990> making<00:00:25.199> things<00:00:25.830> like

00:00:25.970 --> 00:00:25.980 
it's really good for making things like

00:00:25.980 --> 00:00:28.519 
it's really good for making things like
desktop<00:00:26.460> so<00:00:26.699> you<00:00:26.760> get<00:00:27.060> really<00:00:27.990> really<00:00:28.170> really

00:00:28.519 --> 00:00:28.529 
desktop so you get really really really

00:00:28.529 --> 00:00:30.679 
desktop so you get really really really
really<00:00:28.680> really<00:00:29.220> lots<00:00:29.880> of<00:00:30.029> release<00:00:30.330> high

00:00:30.679 --> 00:00:30.689 
really really lots of release high

00:00:30.689 --> 00:00:33.410 
really really lots of release high
resolution<00:00:31.320> pictures<00:00:32.099> so<00:00:32.700> pretty<00:00:32.969> much<00:00:33.059> just

00:00:33.410 --> 00:00:33.420 
resolution pictures so pretty much just

00:00:33.420 --> 00:00:35.000 
resolution pictures so pretty much just
to<00:00:33.600> take<00:00:33.780> these<00:00:34.020> you<00:00:34.410> will<00:00:34.559> just<00:00:34.739> need<00:00:34.860> to

00:00:35.000 --> 00:00:35.010 
to take these you will just need to

00:00:35.010 --> 00:00:38.030 
to take these you will just need to
press<00:00:35.130> f9<00:00:35.420> instead<00:00:36.420> of<00:00:36.540> f2<00:00:36.870> and<00:00:36.899> you<00:00:37.559> can<00:00:37.739> open

00:00:38.030 --> 00:00:38.040 
press f9 instead of f2 and you can open

00:00:38.040 --> 00:00:40.610 
press f9 instead of f2 and you can open
up<00:00:38.100> a<00:00:38.250> menu<00:00:38.460> for<00:00:38.879> this<00:00:39.059> just<00:00:39.540> by<00:00:39.660> pressing<00:00:39.870> ctrl

a ctrl f 9 no no sorry its shift f9 I
lied<00:00:46.680> oh<00:00:46.890> I<00:00:47.820> just<00:00:48.360> did<00:00:48.629> that<00:00:48.660> wrong<00:00:48.899> chef

00:00:49.819 --> 00:00:49.829 
lied oh I just did that wrong chef

00:00:49.829 --> 00:00:53.930 
lied oh I just did that wrong chef
definitely<00:00:50.280> there<00:00:50.430> we<00:00:50.640> go<00:00:50.879> okay<00:00:51.719> so<00:00:52.350> it<00:00:52.590> is<00:00:52.940> set

00:00:53.930 --> 00:00:53.940 
definitely there we go okay so it is set

00:00:53.940 --> 00:00:59.510 
definitely there we go okay so it is set
to<00:00:54.530> 15,000<00:00:55.530> 360<00:00:56.489> by<00:00:57.320> 8640<00:00:58.320> think<00:00:59.039> this<00:00:59.190> is<00:00:59.340> like

00:00:59.510 --> 00:00:59.520 
to 15,000 360 by 8640 think this is like

00:00:59.520 --> 00:01:03.380 
to 15,000 360 by 8640 think this is like
eight<00:01:00.329> times<00:01:00.660> higher<00:01:01.109> than<00:01:01.140> 1080p<00:01:01.949> so<00:01:02.670> it's<00:01:03.329> a

00:01:03.380 --> 00:01:03.390 
eight times higher than 1080p so it's a

00:01:03.390 --> 00:01:05.630 
eight times higher than 1080p so it's a
very<00:01:03.420> detailed<00:01:03.989> image<00:01:04.530> but<00:01:04.890> as<00:01:05.189> you<00:01:05.339> can<00:01:05.430> see

00:01:05.630 --> 00:01:05.640 
very detailed image but as you can see

00:01:05.640 --> 00:01:09.130 
very detailed image but as you can see
it's<00:01:05.760> 379<00:01:06.630> megabytes<00:01:07.229> which<00:01:07.409> is<00:01:07.650> a<00:01:07.799> lot<00:01:08.400> and

00:01:09.130 --> 00:01:09.140 
it's 379 megabytes which is a lot and

00:01:09.140 --> 00:01:11.899 
it's 379 megabytes which is a lot and
that's<00:01:10.140> kind<00:01:10.530> of<00:01:10.650> going<00:01:11.100> to<00:01:11.159> be<00:01:11.250> a<00:01:11.460> lot<00:01:11.850> of

00:01:11.899 --> 00:01:11.909 
that's kind of going to be a lot of

00:01:11.909 --> 00:01:13.580 
that's kind of going to be a lot of
space<00:01:12.150> on<00:01:12.240> your<00:01:12.299> computer<00:01:12.420> so<00:01:12.960> yeah<00:01:13.260> just<00:01:13.470> be

00:01:13.580 --> 00:01:13.590 
space on your computer so yeah just be

00:01:13.590 --> 00:01:15.679 
space on your computer so yeah just be
warned<00:01:13.830> but<00:01:14.369> there's<00:01:14.850> two<00:01:14.970> different<00:01:15.150> picture

00:01:15.679 --> 00:01:15.689 
warned but there's two different picture

00:01:15.689 --> 00:01:18.399 
warned but there's two different picture
modes<00:01:15.900> there's<00:01:16.200> direct<00:01:16.590> TGA<00:01:16.979> and<00:01:17.340> image<00:01:18.180> io

00:01:18.399 --> 00:01:18.409 
modes there's direct TGA and image io

00:01:18.409 --> 00:01:21.980 
modes there's direct TGA and image io
PNG<00:01:19.409> so<00:01:19.979> the<00:01:20.130> image<00:01:20.369> I<00:01:20.490> o<00:01:20.520> P<00:01:20.820> &amp;<00:01:20.970> G<00:01:21.000> is<00:01:21.150> a<00:01:21.689> lot

00:01:21.980 --> 00:01:21.990 
PNG so the image I o P &amp; G is a lot

00:01:21.990 --> 00:01:23.450 
PNG so the image I o P &amp; G is a lot
smaller<00:01:22.229> file<00:01:22.500> size<00:01:22.740> as<00:01:22.920> you<00:01:23.040> can<00:01:23.189> see<00:01:23.340> it's

00:01:23.450 --> 00:01:23.460 
smaller file size as you can see it's

00:01:23.460 --> 00:01:25.370 
smaller file size as you can see it's
only<00:01:23.640> 47<00:01:24.210> megabytes<00:01:24.570> which<00:01:24.780> is<00:01:24.960> still<00:01:25.110> a<00:01:25.170> lot

00:01:25.370 --> 00:01:25.380 
only 47 megabytes which is still a lot

00:01:25.380 --> 00:01:28.190 
only 47 megabytes which is still a lot
but<00:01:25.650> it's<00:01:26.189> a<00:01:26.250> lot<00:01:26.490> less<00:01:27.000> than<00:01:27.299> the<00:01:27.689> other<00:01:27.960> one

00:01:28.190 --> 00:01:28.200 
but it's a lot less than the other one

00:01:28.200 --> 00:01:30.770 
but it's a lot less than the other one
but<00:01:28.740> this<00:01:29.310> one<00:01:29.369> is<00:01:29.670> a<00:01:29.700> lot<00:01:29.909> more<00:01:30.060> memory<00:01:30.509> and

00:01:30.770 --> 00:01:30.780 
but this one is a lot more memory and

00:01:30.780 --> 00:01:34.069 
but this one is a lot more memory and
CPU<00:01:31.320> intensive<00:01:31.500> so<00:01:32.159> I<00:01:32.450> have<00:01:33.450> a<00:01:33.600> pretty<00:01:33.960> good

00:01:34.069 --> 00:01:34.079 
CPU intensive so I have a pretty good

00:01:34.079 --> 00:01:36.950 
CPU intensive so I have a pretty good
computer<00:01:34.530> and<00:01:34.860> I<00:01:35.460> don't<00:01:36.420> think<00:01:36.689> it<00:01:36.840> could

00:01:36.950 --> 00:01:36.960 
computer and I don't think it could

00:01:36.960 --> 00:01:39.200 
computer and I don't think it could
really<00:01:37.280> well<00:01:38.280> I<00:01:38.310> tried<00:01:38.640> to<00:01:38.759> take<00:01:38.909> a<00:01:38.939> picture

00:01:39.200 --> 00:01:39.210 
really well I tried to take a picture

00:01:39.210 --> 00:01:40.940 
really well I tried to take a picture
and<00:01:39.329> it<00:01:39.570> just<00:01:39.720> says<00:01:39.960> it<00:01:40.170> kind<00:01:40.710> of<00:01:40.740> failed

00:01:40.940 --> 00:01:40.950 
and it just says it kind of failed

00:01:40.950 --> 00:01:42.920 
and it just says it kind of failed
trying<00:01:41.430> to<00:01:41.610> take<00:01:41.759> the<00:01:41.880> picture<00:01:42.180> with<00:01:42.270> this<00:01:42.420> so

00:01:42.920 --> 00:01:42.930 
trying to take the picture with this so

00:01:42.930 --> 00:01:47.030 
trying to take the picture with this so
I<00:01:43.290> just<00:01:43.979> used<00:01:44.280> this<00:01:44.970> and<00:01:45.560> super<00:01:46.560> sampling<00:01:46.920> you

00:01:47.030 --> 00:01:47.040 
I just used this and super sampling you

00:01:47.040 --> 00:01:49.789 
I just used this and super sampling you
can<00:01:47.189> only<00:01:47.310> use<00:01:47.399> with<00:01:47.850> image<00:01:48.180> I<00:01:48.360> oh<00:01:48.390> and<00:01:48.799> pretty

00:01:49.789 --> 00:01:49.799 
can only use with image I oh and pretty

00:01:49.799 --> 00:01:52.249 
can only use with image I oh and pretty
much<00:01:49.890> it's<00:01:50.189> just<00:01:50.399> anti-aliasing<00:01:51.360> I<00:01:51.540> think<00:01:51.840> so

00:01:52.249 --> 00:01:52.259 
much it's just anti-aliasing I think so

00:01:52.259 --> 00:01:54.109 
much it's just anti-aliasing I think so
it<00:01:52.649> just<00:01:52.950> makes<00:01:53.070> your<00:01:53.220> picture<00:01:53.579> look<00:01:53.700> smoother

00:01:54.109 --> 00:01:54.119 
it just makes your picture look smoother

00:01:54.119 --> 00:01:56.389 
it just makes your picture look smoother
many<00:01:54.810> ways<00:01:54.960> with<00:01:55.170> direct<00:01:55.500> EGA<00:01:55.890> you<00:01:56.100> get<00:01:56.369> a

00:01:56.389 --> 00:01:56.399 
many ways with direct EGA you get a

00:01:56.399 --> 00:01:58.429 
many ways with direct EGA you get a
really<00:01:56.610> large<00:01:56.880> file<00:01:57.149> size<00:01:57.180> but<00:01:57.750> it<00:01:57.930> can<00:01:58.079> handle

00:01:58.429 --> 00:01:58.439 
really large file size but it can handle

00:01:58.439 --> 00:02:01.310 
really large file size but it can handle
a<00:01:58.740> lot<00:01:58.890> bigger<00:01:59.990> resolutions<00:02:00.990> to<00:02:01.170> take

00:02:01.310 --> 00:02:01.320 
a lot bigger resolutions to take

00:02:01.320 --> 00:02:03.830 
a lot bigger resolutions to take
pictures<00:02:01.560> with<00:02:01.860> and<00:02:02.100> i'll<00:02:03.000> be<00:02:03.450> showing<00:02:03.630> you<00:02:03.810> a

00:02:03.830 --> 00:02:03.840 
pictures with and i'll be showing you a

pictures with and i'll be showing you a
picture<00:02:04.170> with<00:02:04.469> this<00:02:04.740> and<00:02:05.070> it's<00:02:05.670> really<00:02:06.030> quite

00:02:06.830 --> 00:02:06.840 
picture with this and it's really quite

00:02:06.840 --> 00:02:09.889 
picture with this and it's really quite
ridiculous<00:02:07.079> how<00:02:07.819> detailed<00:02:08.819> it<00:02:09.030> is<00:02:09.149> and<00:02:09.450> you

00:02:09.889 --> 00:02:09.899 
ridiculous how detailed it is and you

00:02:09.899 --> 00:02:12.890 
ridiculous how detailed it is and you
can<00:02:09.929> just<00:02:10.440> change<00:02:10.920> this<00:02:11.250> to<00:02:11.610> a<00:02:11.640> PNG<00:02:12.420> picture

00:02:12.890 --> 00:02:12.900 
can just change this to a PNG picture

00:02:12.900 --> 00:02:15.350 
can just change this to a PNG picture
afterwards<00:02:13.410> with<00:02:13.709> something<00:02:14.220> like<00:02:14.370> gimp<00:02:14.670> so

00:02:15.350 --> 00:02:15.360 
afterwards with something like gimp so

00:02:15.360 --> 00:02:17.630 
afterwards with something like gimp so
yeah<00:02:15.840> that'll<00:02:16.200> just<00:02:16.560> that's<00:02:17.129> just<00:02:17.190> kind<00:02:17.459> of<00:02:17.520> an

00:02:17.630 --> 00:02:17.640 
yeah that'll just that's just kind of an

00:02:17.640 --> 00:02:19.339 
yeah that'll just that's just kind of an
option<00:02:17.970> if<00:02:18.090> you<00:02:18.150> want<00:02:18.330> to<00:02:18.450> do<00:02:18.569> so<00:02:19.050> i<00:02:19.080> want<00:02:19.290> to

option if you want to do so i want to
have<00:02:19.650> done<00:02:20.010> your<00:02:20.250> dimensions<00:02:21.180> you<00:02:21.270> like<00:02:21.420> just

00:02:21.650 --> 00:02:21.660 
have done your dimensions you like just

00:02:21.660 --> 00:02:24.320 
have done your dimensions you like just
click<00:02:21.810> save<00:02:22.110> and<00:02:22.410> then<00:02:22.650> i<00:02:23.060> guess<00:02:24.060> i've<00:02:24.209> already

click save and then i guess i've already
taken<00:02:24.569> that<00:02:24.900> picture<00:02:25.140> I'll<00:02:25.500> just<00:02:25.739> take

00:02:25.850 --> 00:02:25.860 
taken that picture I'll just take

00:02:25.860 --> 00:02:28.820 
taken that picture I'll just take
another<00:02:26.160> one<00:02:26.310> though<00:02:26.489> so<00:02:27.239> I'm<00:02:27.510> pretty<00:02:28.020> much<00:02:28.140> to

00:02:28.820 --> 00:02:28.830 
another one though so I'm pretty much to

00:02:28.830 --> 00:02:30.589 
another one though so I'm pretty much to
take<00:02:29.040> the<00:02:29.160> picture<00:02:29.459> I'll<00:02:29.700> be<00:02:29.970> comparing<00:02:30.450> two

00:02:30.589 --> 00:02:30.599 
take the picture I'll be comparing two

00:02:30.599 --> 00:02:32.000 
take the picture I'll be comparing two
different<00:02:30.629> ones<00:02:30.989> so<00:02:31.140> first<00:02:31.560> I'll<00:02:31.709> just<00:02:31.860> take<00:02:31.950> a

00:02:32.000 --> 00:02:32.010 
different ones so first I'll just take a

00:02:32.010 --> 00:02:35.119 
different ones so first I'll just take a
regular<00:02:32.190> screen<00:02:32.640> shot<00:02:32.819> like<00:02:33.540> that<00:02:33.569> and<00:02:34.019> then<00:02:34.650> I

00:02:35.119 --> 00:02:35.129 
regular screen shot like that and then I

00:02:35.129 --> 00:02:39.470 
regular screen shot like that and then I
will<00:02:35.489> show<00:02:35.790> you<00:02:35.849> now<00:02:36.150> the<00:02:36.629> bigger<00:02:37.319> one<00:02:38.480> so

00:02:39.470 --> 00:02:39.480 
will show you now the bigger one so

00:02:39.480 --> 00:02:41.770 
will show you now the bigger one so
it'll<00:02:39.780> kind<00:02:39.989> of<00:02:40.050> lag<00:02:40.260> for<00:02:40.440> a<00:02:40.500> little<00:02:40.590> bit<00:02:40.769> and

00:02:41.770 --> 00:02:41.780 
it'll kind of lag for a little bit and

00:02:41.780 --> 00:02:44.930 
it'll kind of lag for a little bit and
see<00:02:42.780> now<00:02:42.959> so<00:02:43.230> it<00:02:43.319> save<00:02:43.500> the<00:02:43.680> screenshot<00:02:43.890> and<00:02:44.400> I

00:02:44.930 --> 00:02:44.940 
see now so it save the screenshot and I

00:02:44.940 --> 00:02:47.210 
see now so it save the screenshot and I
will<00:02:45.269> go<00:02:45.420> over<00:02:45.569> to<00:02:45.930> GIMP<00:02:46.470> now<00:02:46.739> just<00:02:47.069> to<00:02:47.190> show

00:02:47.210 --> 00:02:47.220 
will go over to GIMP now just to show

00:02:47.220 --> 00:02:50.660 
will go over to GIMP now just to show
you<00:02:47.489> the<00:02:48.950> both<00:02:49.950> of<00:02:50.099> them<00:02:50.220> compared

00:02:50.660 --> 00:02:50.670 
you the both of them compared

00:02:50.670 --> 00:02:52.930 
you the both of them compared
side-by-side<00:02:51.030> so<00:02:51.780> see<00:02:52.140> you<00:02:52.200> in<00:02:52.260> just<00:02:52.349> a<00:02:52.500> sec

00:02:52.930 --> 00:02:52.940 
side-by-side so see you in just a sec

00:02:52.940 --> 00:02:54.830 
side-by-side so see you in just a sec
alright<00:02:53.940> so<00:02:54.120> first<00:02:54.330> we're<00:02:54.569> going<00:02:54.660> to<00:02:54.750> be

00:02:54.830 --> 00:02:54.840 
alright so first we're going to be

00:02:54.840 --> 00:02:56.780 
alright so first we're going to be
looking<00:02:54.989> at<00:02:55.260> the<00:02:55.410> lower<00:02:55.650> resolution<00:02:56.459> image

00:02:56.780 --> 00:02:56.790 
looking at the lower resolution image

00:02:56.790 --> 00:02:58.970 
looking at the lower resolution image
which<00:02:57.000> is<00:02:57.030> right<00:02:57.360> here<00:02:57.390> so<00:02:58.110> when<00:02:58.620> we're<00:02:58.800> just

00:02:58.970 --> 00:02:58.980 
which is right here so when we're just

00:02:58.980 --> 00:03:00.350 
which is right here so when we're just
looking<00:02:59.280> at<00:02:59.400> it<00:02:59.430> like<00:02:59.550> this<00:02:59.730> it<00:02:59.970> looks<00:03:00.060> fine

00:03:00.350 --> 00:03:00.360 
looking at it like this it looks fine

00:03:00.360 --> 00:03:01.970 
looking at it like this it looks fine
but<00:03:00.390> once<00:03:00.780> you<00:03:00.900> zoom<00:03:00.930> in<00:03:01.319> on<00:03:01.500> things<00:03:01.709> like

00:03:01.970 --> 00:03:01.980 
but once you zoom in on things like

00:03:01.980 --> 00:03:03.770 
but once you zoom in on things like
let's<00:03:02.310> look<00:03:02.550> at<00:03:02.700> this<00:03:02.819> nice<00:03:03.060> little<00:03:03.180> cow<00:03:03.480> it's

00:03:03.770 --> 00:03:03.780 
let's look at this nice little cow it's

00:03:03.780 --> 00:03:07.809 
let's look at this nice little cow it's
a<00:03:04.470> blob<00:03:04.769> and<00:03:05.129> if<00:03:05.519> we<00:03:05.550> look<00:03:05.819> at<00:03:06.060> flowers<00:03:06.750> they're

00:03:07.809 --> 00:03:07.819 
a blob and if we look at flowers they're

00:03:07.819 --> 00:03:10.790 
a blob and if we look at flowers they're
even<00:03:08.819> worse<00:03:09.090> blobs<00:03:09.450> that<00:03:09.659> are<00:03:10.110> barely

00:03:10.790 --> 00:03:10.800 
even worse blobs that are barely

00:03:10.800 --> 00:03:12.290 
even worse blobs that are barely
distinguishable<00:03:11.519> only<00:03:11.909> because<00:03:12.180> they're

00:03:12.290 --> 00:03:12.300 
distinguishable only because they're

00:03:12.300 --> 00:03:15.470 
distinguishable only because they're
yellow<00:03:12.599> but<00:03:13.260> if<00:03:13.560> we<00:03:13.709> go<00:03:13.920> over<00:03:13.950> to<00:03:14.790> the<00:03:15.269> next

00:03:15.470 --> 00:03:15.480 
yellow but if we go over to the next

00:03:15.480 --> 00:03:17.600 
yellow but if we go over to the next
picture<00:03:15.900> which<00:03:16.230> is<00:03:16.349> right<00:03:16.530> here<00:03:16.560> and<00:03:16.860> resume

00:03:17.600 --> 00:03:17.610 
picture which is right here and resume

00:03:17.610 --> 00:03:20.869 
picture which is right here and resume
it<00:03:17.790> is<00:03:18.150> much<00:03:18.870> much<00:03:19.200> much<00:03:19.560> more<00:03:19.890> detailed<00:03:20.340> now

00:03:20.869 --> 00:03:20.879 
it is much much much more detailed now

00:03:20.879 --> 00:03:22.820 
it is much much much more detailed now
is<00:03:21.180> a<00:03:21.209> little<00:03:21.629> bit<00:03:21.810> blurry<00:03:22.230> when<00:03:22.500> you<00:03:22.650> get

00:03:22.820 --> 00:03:22.830 
is a little bit blurry when you get

00:03:22.830 --> 00:03:25.910 
is a little bit blurry when you get
closer<00:03:23.099> but<00:03:23.430> still<00:03:23.489> is<00:03:24.090> incredibly<00:03:24.930> more

00:03:25.910 --> 00:03:25.920 
closer but still is incredibly more

00:03:25.920 --> 00:03:28.520 
closer but still is incredibly more
detailed<00:03:26.310> that's<00:03:27.060> that<00:03:27.659> didn't<00:03:28.170> sound<00:03:28.319> right

00:03:28.520 --> 00:03:28.530 
detailed that's that didn't sound right

00:03:28.530 --> 00:03:30.979 
detailed that's that didn't sound right
but<00:03:28.590> whatever<00:03:29.430> but<00:03:29.790> still<00:03:30.209> look<00:03:30.629> at<00:03:30.720> the<00:03:30.810> cow

00:03:30.979 --> 00:03:30.989 
but whatever but still look at the cow

00:03:30.989 --> 00:03:32.479 
but whatever but still look at the cow
right<00:03:31.379> there<00:03:31.650> and<00:03:31.920> then<00:03:32.010> I'll<00:03:32.159> go<00:03:32.280> back<00:03:32.430> and

00:03:32.479 --> 00:03:32.489 
right there and then I'll go back and

00:03:32.489 --> 00:03:35.059 
right there and then I'll go back and
look<00:03:33.150> at<00:03:33.299> the<00:03:33.420> cow<00:03:33.540> there<00:03:33.780> it's<00:03:34.019> just<00:03:34.260> such<00:03:35.040> a

00:03:35.059 --> 00:03:35.069 
look at the cow there it's just such a

00:03:35.069 --> 00:03:37.610 
look at the cow there it's just such a
big<00:03:35.220> difference<00:03:35.549> so<00:03:36.299> this<00:03:36.930> will<00:03:37.110> be<00:03:37.230> really

00:03:37.610 --> 00:03:37.620 
big difference so this will be really

00:03:37.620 --> 00:03:39.530 
big difference so this will be really
good<00:03:37.950> if<00:03:38.220> you're<00:03:38.640> going<00:03:38.909> to<00:03:39.000> try<00:03:39.239> and<00:03:39.269> make

00:03:39.530 --> 00:03:39.540 
good if you're going to try and make

00:03:39.540 --> 00:03:43.039 
good if you're going to try and make
really<00:03:40.290> detailed<00:03:41.040> pictures<00:03:41.580> or<00:03:41.940> just<00:03:42.750> like<00:03:43.019> a

00:03:43.039 --> 00:03:43.049 
really detailed pictures or just like a

00:03:43.049 --> 00:03:46.970 
really detailed pictures or just like a
good<00:03:43.940> screenshot<00:03:44.940> for<00:03:45.360> your<00:03:45.510> desktop<00:03:46.170> or<00:03:46.560> just

it's I think it's just like from an
angle<00:04:09.060> and<00:04:09.299> it's<00:04:09.510> a<00:04:09.799> it<00:04:10.799> kind<00:04:11.040> of<00:04:11.129> makes<00:04:11.549> it

00:04:11.660 --> 00:04:11.670 
angle and it's a it kind of makes it

00:04:11.670 --> 00:04:14.479 
angle and it's a it kind of makes it
look<00:04:11.849> different<00:04:12.000> so<00:04:12.569> to<00:04:13.140> go<00:04:13.590> into<00:04:13.980> this<00:04:14.129> mode

00:04:14.479 --> 00:04:14.489 
look different so to go into this mode

00:04:14.489 --> 00:04:15.530 
look different so to go into this mode
you<00:04:14.819> have<00:04:14.939> to<00:04:15.060> press

number pad 5 you can switch that

00:04:17.729 --> 00:04:20.330 
number pad 5 you can switch that
something<00:04:18.269> else<00:04:18.449> and<00:04:18.600> as<00:04:19.410> you<00:04:19.530> can<00:04:19.650> see<00:04:19.680> it

00:04:35.719 --> 00:04:35.729 
render distance you could really take a

00:04:35.729 --> 00:04:38.420 
render distance you could really take a
awesome<00:04:36.419> like<00:04:36.960> landscape<00:04:37.560> picture<00:04:38.070> of<00:04:38.250> that

straight-up view by pressing seven

00:04:43.289 --> 00:04:45.350 
straight-up view by pressing seven
straight<00:04:43.919> above<00:04:44.160> as<00:04:44.669> you<00:04:44.880> see<00:04:45.210> it's

00:04:45.350 --> 00:04:45.360 
straight above as you see it's

these are all on the number pad by the

00:04:55.560 --> 00:04:57.680 
these are all on the number pad by the
way<00:04:55.710> and<00:04:55.919> so<00:04:56.910> it<00:04:57.000> looks<00:04:57.150> like<00:04:57.210> that<00:04:57.419> and<00:04:57.570> then
