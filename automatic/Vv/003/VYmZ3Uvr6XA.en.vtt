bit smoother if that's what you're after
but<00:02:34.180> other<00:02:35.180> than<00:02:35.390> that<00:02:35.450> it's<00:02:35.810> the<00:02:36.020> same

00:02:36.190 --> 00:02:36.200 
but other than that it's the same

00:02:36.200 --> 00:02:39.190 
but other than that it's the same
exactly<00:02:36.860> the<00:02:36.950> same<00:02:37.220> experience<00:02:37.760> I<00:02:38.600> did<00:02:38.990> have

00:02:41.500 --> 00:02:41.510 
trouble fighting finding these servers

00:02:41.510 --> 00:02:42.610 
trouble fighting finding these servers

distinguish<00:03:41.210> you<00:03:41.990> know<00:03:42.110> the<00:03:42.410> main

00:03:42.550 --> 00:03:42.560 
distinguish you know the main

00:03:42.560 --> 00:03:45.070 
distinguish you know the main
differences<00:03:43.070> between<00:03:43.130> console<00:03:43.850> and<00:03:44.090> you<00:03:44.960> know

00:03:45.070 --> 00:03:45.080 
differences between console and you know

00:03:45.080 --> 00:03:48.070 
differences between console and you know
pc<00:03:45.530> and<00:03:45.800> obviously<00:03:46.550> the<00:03:46.760> pc<00:03:47.120> version<00:03:47.150> runs<00:03:47.780> on

00:03:48.070 --> 00:03:48.080 
pc and obviously the pc version runs on

00:03:48.080 --> 00:03:51.640 
pc and obviously the pc version runs on
I<00:03:48.410> think<00:03:48.830> 65<00:03:49.660> 60-plus<00:03:50.660> frames<00:03:50.990> per<00:03:51.200> second

00:03:51.640 --> 00:03:51.650 
I think 65 60-plus frames per second

00:03:51.650 --> 00:03:54.670 
I think 65 60-plus frames per second
whereas<00:03:52.460> the<00:03:52.700> console<00:03:53.540> version<00:03:53.570> is<00:03:54.110> capped<00:03:54.500> at

00:03:54.670 --> 00:03:54.680 
whereas the console version is capped at

00:03:54.680 --> 00:03:56.380 
whereas the console version is capped at
30<00:03:55.100> frames<00:03:55.280> per<00:03:55.490> second<00:03:55.940> and<00:03:56.030> that<00:03:56.210> is

00:03:56.380 --> 00:03:56.390 
30 frames per second and that is

00:03:56.390 --> 00:03:59.020 
30 frames per second and that is
noticeable<00:03:56.930> it's<00:03:57.200> a<00:03:57.620> bit<00:03:57.770> smoother<00:03:58.250> but<00:03:58.460> you

00:03:59.020 --> 00:03:59.030 
noticeable it's a bit smoother but you

00:03:59.030 --> 00:04:00.640 
noticeable it's a bit smoother but you

if<00:05:27.220> you<00:05:27.340> have<00:05:27.460> a<00:05:27.490> console<00:05:28.030> version<00:05:28.390> it's

00:05:29.570 --> 00:05:29.580 
if you have a console version it's

00:05:29.580 --> 00:05:31.410 
if you have a console version it's
basically<00:05:30.580> the<00:05:30.670> same<00:05:30.790> thing<00:05:30.940> I<00:05:31.150> mean<00:05:31.300> I'm

00:05:31.410 --> 00:05:31.420 
basically the same thing I mean I'm

00:05:31.420 --> 00:05:32.940 
basically the same thing I mean I'm
trying<00:05:31.690> to<00:05:31.840> I'm<00:05:32.080> trying<00:05:32.140> to<00:05:32.500> really<00:05:32.740> I'm

00:05:32.940 --> 00:05:32.950 
trying to I'm trying to really I'm

00:05:32.950 --> 00:05:35.610

trying<00:05:33.190> really<00:05:33.340> hard<00:05:33.490> to<00:05:33.730> I<00:05:34.210> don't<00:05:34.960> know<00:05:35.140> find

00:05:35.610 --> 00:05:35.620 
trying really hard to I don't know find

00:05:35.620 --> 00:05:38.220 
trying really hard to I don't know find
ways<00:05:35.980> to<00:05:36.340> to<00:05:36.670> really<00:05:36.910> compare<00:05:37.480> but<00:05:37.810> other<00:05:38.050> than

00:05:38.220 --> 00:05:38.230 
ways to to really compare but other than

00:05:38.230 --> 00:05:40.020 
ways to to really compare but other than
graphical<00:05:38.740> differences<00:05:39.280> and<00:05:39.460> just<00:05:39.790> overall

00:05:40.020 --> 00:05:40.030 
graphical differences and just overall

00:05:40.030 --> 00:05:42.630 
graphical differences and just overall
smoothness<00:05:40.780> there's<00:05:41.290> really<00:05:41.560> none<00:05:41.830> so<00:05:42.100> if<00:05:42.400> you

00:05:42.630 --> 00:05:42.640 
smoothness there's really none so if you

00:05:42.640 --> 00:05:44.490 
smoothness there's really none so if you
have<00:05:42.760> a<00:05:42.790> high<00:05:42.940> end<00:05:43.120> pc<00:05:43.240> sure<00:05:43.690> go<00:05:44.050> buy<00:05:44.260> or

00:06:16.980 --> 00:06:16.990 
difference like the second I jump into

00:06:50.710 --> 00:06:50.720 
and boom you have a full server almost

00:06:50.720 --> 00:06:53.170 
and boom you have a full server almost
every<00:06:51.080> single<00:06:51.410> time<00:06:51.650> and<00:06:51.860> that's<00:06:52.700> a<00:06:52.790> guarantee

00:06:53.170 --> 00:06:53.180 
every single time and that's a guarantee

00:06:53.180 --> 00:06:55.120 
every single time and that's a guarantee
obviously<00:06:53.960> you're<00:06:54.080> gonna<00:06:54.260> join<00:06:54.470> some<00:06:54.740> servers

00:06:55.120 --> 00:06:55.130 
obviously you're gonna join some servers

00:06:55.130 --> 00:06:57.610 
obviously you're gonna join some servers
that<00:06:55.340> are<00:06:55.400> at<00:06:56.240> empty<00:06:56.600> or<00:06:56.930> you're<00:06:57.110> the<00:06:57.260> only<00:06:57.410> one

00:06:57.610 --> 00:06:57.620 
that are at empty or you're the only one

00:06:57.620 --> 00:06:59.560 
that are at empty or you're the only one
there<00:06:57.860> but<00:06:58.160> only<00:06:58.430> console<00:06:58.760> happens<00:06:59.210> a<00:06:59.420> little

00:06:59.560 --> 00:06:59.570 
there but only console happens a little

00:06:59.570 --> 00:07:03.040 
there but only console happens a little
bit<00:06:59.810> more<00:07:00.680> I<00:07:01.040> guess<00:07:01.760> it's<00:07:02.180> not<00:07:02.420> as<00:07:02.570> common<00:07:02.930> on

00:07:03.040 --> 00:07:03.050 
bit more I guess it's not as common on

00:07:03.050 --> 00:07:06.790 
bit more I guess it's not as common on
the<00:07:03.080> console<00:07:03.470> as<00:07:03.590> it<00:07:03.740> is<00:07:03.830> on<00:07:03.860> the<00:07:04.040> pc<00:07:04.430> ah<00:07:05.800> but

00:07:06.790 --> 00:07:06.800 
the console as it is on the pc ah but
