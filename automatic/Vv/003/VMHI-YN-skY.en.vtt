00:00:05.899 --> 00:00:09.630
 in this video we will see 

00:00:08.040 --> 00:00:10.880
 how to make a man with hair 

00:00:09.630 --> 00:00:12.450
 short in manga style 

00:00:10.880 --> 00:00:14.730
 usually men have hair 

00:00:12.450 --> 00:00:16.949
 shorter than the girls here it's a 

00:00:14.730 --> 00:00:18.060
 man with pretty hard look so he 

00:00:16.949 --> 00:00:20.070
 must make him a haircut in 

00:00:18.060 --> 00:00:21.750
 Therefore we must start with 

00:00:20.070 --> 00:00:23.789
 delimit the hair so their 

00:00:21.750 --> 00:00:25.019
 thickness relative to the head as 

00:00:23.789 --> 00:00:26.640
 the hair is shorter and is 

00:00:25.019 --> 00:00:27.930
 lighter and so you have to do the 

00:00:26.640 --> 00:00:29.939
 line slightly higher than if 

00:00:27.930 --> 00:00:31.800
 it was long hair boundaries and 

00:00:29.939 --> 00:00:36.600
 well the hair on the forehead and on the 

00:00:31.800 --> 00:00:39.930
 side makes a line to mark the meaning 

00:00:36.600 --> 00:00:41.430
 hair erase unnecessary lines 

00:00:39.930 --> 00:00:43.020
 then we have to determine where 

00:00:41.430 --> 00:00:44.879
 leave the hair to be able to 

00:00:43.020 --> 00:00:46.530
 to draw in the right direction we 

00:00:44.879 --> 00:00:52.170
 let's put here on the tip at the top of his 

00:00:46.530 --> 00:00:52.829
 front the hair on the side go in 

00:00:52.170 --> 00:00:54.570
 the same way 

00:00:52.829 --> 00:00:56.690
 but beyond line on the side of 

00:00:54.570 --> 00:00:56.690
 face 

00:00:57.750 --> 00:01:02.010
 draw the locks of hair as 

00:00:59.620 --> 00:01:02.010
 this 

00:01:16.620 --> 00:01:22.220
 her hair changes meaning also at 

00:01:18.420 --> 00:01:22.220
 level of the neck then 

00:01:30.420 --> 00:01:34.690
 then you have to make the contrasts 

00:01:32.500 --> 00:01:36.400
 for each of the wicks the wicked 

00:01:34.690 --> 00:01:38.170
 this form it is necessary to draw the waves 

00:01:36.400 --> 00:01:40.120
 on each side and leave a reflection on 

00:01:38.170 --> 00:01:42.810
 center applied this technique on 

00:01:40.120 --> 00:01:42.810
 all the wicks 

00:01:53.690 --> 00:01:58.300
 blacken the baselines for 

00:01:55.160 --> 00:01:58.300
 enhance the contrasts 

00:02:32.290 --> 00:02:36.130
 you finished going down
