people<00:00:45.720> use<00:00:45.930> this<00:00:46.080> back<00:00:46.290> up<00:00:46.320> the<00:00:47.159> spec<00:00:47.400> ops

00:00:47.570 --> 00:00:47.580 
people use this back up the spec ops

black<00:00:48.050> camouflage<00:00:49.050> on<00:00:49.440> this<00:00:49.589> one<00:00:50.629> along

00:00:51.619 --> 00:00:51.629 
black camouflage on this one along

00:00:51.629 --> 00:00:53.210

looking<00:00:51.900> at<00:00:52.140> this<00:00:52.260> line<00:00:52.500> I'd<00:00:52.800> say<00:00:53.010> it's<00:00:53.159> a

00:00:53.210 --> 00:00:53.220 
looking at this line I'd say it's a

00:00:53.220 --> 00:00:55.549 
looking at this line I'd say it's a
pretty<00:00:53.430> good<00:00:53.610> one<00:00:53.760> although<00:00:54.750> not<00:00:54.930> the<00:00:54.960> best<00:00:55.229> I

00:00:55.549 --> 00:00:55.559 
pretty good one although not the best I

00:00:55.559 --> 00:00:56.960 
pretty good one although not the best I
think<00:00:55.830> you<00:00:56.159> have<00:00:56.309> to<00:00:56.339> keep<00:00:56.549> in<00:00:56.729> mind<00:00:56.940> that

00:00:56.960 --> 00:00:56.970 
think you have to keep in mind that

00:00:56.970 --> 00:00:58.219 
think you have to keep in mind that
you're<00:00:57.120> going<00:00:57.210> to<00:00:57.269> stand<00:00:57.449> out<00:00:57.600> against<00:00:58.019> leiter

00:00:58.219 --> 00:00:58.229 
you're going to stand out against leiter

00:00:58.229 --> 00:01:00.410 
you're going to stand out against leiter

00:01:00.410 --> 00:01:00.420 
environments like I said you know pause

00:01:00.420 --> 00:01:02.479 
environments like I said you know pause
it<00:01:00.570> there<00:01:00.600> and<00:01:00.989> have<00:01:01.949> a<00:01:02.010> better<00:01:02.159> look<00:01:02.339> at<00:01:02.460> it

we're going to have a little look at is

00:01:05.549 --> 00:01:07.310 
we're going to have a little look at is
Terran<00:01:06.090> not<00:01:06.420> turn<00:01:06.600> on<00:01:06.690> highway<00:01:06.990> that<00:01:07.200> was

00:01:08.180 --> 00:01:08.190 
tearing highway we're going to have a

00:01:08.190 --> 00:01:10.820 
tearing highway we're going to have a
look<00:01:08.310> at<00:01:08.430> car<00:01:08.640> guilin<00:01:09.030> now

look at car guilin now
what<00:01:11.790> I<00:01:11.820> took<00:01:11.970> away<00:01:12.210> from<00:01:12.420> this<00:01:12.900> particular

00:01:14.290 --> 00:01:14.300 
what I took away from this particular

00:01:14.300 --> 00:01:16.490 
what I took away from this particular
set<00:01:15.300> up<00:01:15.420> here<00:01:15.720> with<00:01:15.750> these<00:01:16.050> are<00:01:16.200> different

00:01:16.490 --> 00:01:16.500 
set up here with these are different

00:01:16.500 --> 00:01:19.430 
set up here with these are different
options<00:01:16.730> was<00:01:17.730> that<00:01:18.090> really<00:01:18.840> doesn't<00:01:19.080> make<00:01:19.290> too

00:01:19.430 --> 00:01:19.440 
options was that really doesn't make too

00:01:19.440 --> 00:01:20.990 
options was that really doesn't make too
much<00:01:19.470> difference<00:01:19.590> you<00:01:20.010> can<00:01:20.070> see<00:01:20.280> even<00:01:20.430> jungle

00:01:20.990 --> 00:01:21.000 
much difference you can see even jungle

00:01:21.000 --> 00:01:22.760 
much difference you can see even jungle
kind<00:01:21.480> of<00:01:21.600> works<00:01:21.780> in<00:01:21.960> this<00:01:22.080> one<00:01:22.290> jungle<00:01:22.590> works

00:01:22.760 --> 00:01:22.770 
kind of works in this one jungle works

00:01:22.770 --> 00:01:25.850 
kind of works in this one jungle works
reasonably<00:01:23.490> well<00:01:23.580> actually<00:01:24.290> but<00:01:25.290> on<00:01:25.410> this<00:01:25.560> map

00:01:25.850 --> 00:01:25.860 
reasonably well actually but on this map

00:01:25.860 --> 00:01:27.980 
reasonably well actually but on this map
I<00:01:26.160> don't<00:01:26.730> think<00:01:26.820> it<00:01:27.150> really<00:01:27.180> matters<00:01:27.360> too<00:01:27.780> much

00:01:27.980 --> 00:01:27.990 
I don't think it really matters too much

00:01:27.990 --> 00:01:30.260 
I don't think it really matters too much
actually<00:01:28.320> maybe<00:01:29.280> it<00:01:29.490> matters<00:01:29.730> more<00:01:29.880> on<00:01:30.030> Terran

00:01:30.260 --> 00:01:30.270 
actually maybe it matters more on Terran

00:01:30.270 --> 00:01:32.300 
actually maybe it matters more on Terran
highway<00:01:30.660> the<00:01:30.960> darker<00:01:31.260> maps<00:01:31.500> like<00:01:31.830> that<00:01:32.070> or

00:01:32.300 --> 00:01:32.310

highway the darker maps like that or
caspian<00:01:32.730> border<00:01:32.760> in<00:01:33.540> fact<00:01:33.690> we're<00:01:33.810> going<00:01:33.930> to

00:01:33.980 --> 00:01:33.990 
caspian border in fact we're going to

00:01:33.990 --> 00:01:35.270 
caspian border in fact we're going to
have<00:01:34.080> a<00:01:34.110> look<00:01:34.170> at<00:01:34.260> caspian<00:01:34.620> border<00:01:34.710> next

00:01:35.270 --> 00:01:35.280

00:01:47.510 --> 00:01:47.520 
much difference really it's interesting

00:01:47.520 --> 00:01:49.370 
much difference really it's interesting
the<00:01:47.940> way<00:01:47.970> that<00:01:48.210> the<00:01:48.300> jungle<00:01:48.660> poner<00:01:48.870> works<00:01:49.170> on

00:01:49.370 --> 00:01:49.380 
the way that the jungle poner works on

00:01:49.380 --> 00:01:50.840 
the way that the jungle poner works on
this<00:01:49.560> on<00:01:49.920> this<00:01:49.980> map<00:01:50.370> I<00:01:50.520> think<00:01:50.700> that's

00:01:50.840 --> 00:01:50.850 
this on this map I think that's

00:01:50.850 --> 00:01:52.160 
this on this map I think that's
something<00:01:51.000> I'll<00:01:51.210> take<00:01:51.390> away<00:01:51.630> from<00:01:51.810> this<00:01:51.960> I'll

00:01:52.160 --> 00:01:52.170 
something I'll take away from this I'll

00:01:52.170 --> 00:01:53.390 
something I'll take away from this I'll
probably<00:01:52.290> going<00:01:52.560> to<00:01:52.620> use<00:01:52.710> jungle<00:01:53.130> on<00:01:53.250> this

00:01:53.390 --> 00:01:53.400 
probably going to use jungle on this

00:01:53.400 --> 00:01:56.060 
probably going to use jungle on this
when<00:01:53.610> i'm<00:01:53.700> doing<00:01:53.850> competition<00:01:54.480> games<00:01:55.010> now<00:01:56.010> the

00:01:59.660 --> 00:01:59.670 
going to run through the river here into

00:01:59.670 --> 00:02:03.200 
going to run through the river here into
the<00:01:59.790> flag<00:02:00.030> name<00:02:00.540> to<00:02:00.810> see<00:02:01.050> and<00:02:01.670> as<00:02:02.670> they<00:02:02.940> enter

00:02:03.200 --> 00:02:03.210 
the flag name to see and as they enter

00:02:03.210 --> 00:02:04.790 
the flag name to see and as they enter
the<00:02:03.330> dappled<00:02:03.720> shade<00:02:03.780> you<00:02:04.110> can<00:02:04.260> see<00:02:04.410> they<00:02:04.560> kind

00:02:04.790 --> 00:02:04.800 
the dappled shade you can see they kind

00:02:04.800 --> 00:02:06.750 
the dappled shade you can see they kind
of<00:02:04.830> disappear

00:02:06.750 --> 00:02:06.760 
of disappear

00:02:06.760 --> 00:02:08.700 
of disappear
so<00:02:07.480> that's<00:02:07.660> that's<00:02:07.900> really<00:02:08.200> interesting<00:02:08.290> to

00:02:08.700 --> 00:02:08.710 
so that's that's really interesting to

00:02:08.710 --> 00:02:10.469 
so that's that's really interesting to
know<00:02:08.860> you<00:02:08.920> know<00:02:09.220> try<00:02:09.670> and<00:02:09.790> stick<00:02:10.030> to<00:02:10.060> the<00:02:10.240> shade

00:02:10.469 --> 00:02:10.479

00:02:14.110 --> 00:02:14.120 

00:02:14.120 --> 00:02:16.000 

yeah<00:02:14.450> that<00:02:14.690> not<00:02:15.019> too<00:02:15.170> bad<00:02:15.319> that's<00:02:15.530> woodland

00:02:20.140 --> 00:02:20.150 
woods and it kind of works actually so

00:02:20.150 --> 00:02:22.119 
woods and it kind of works actually so
that's<00:02:20.870> not<00:02:21.049> too<00:02:21.230> bad<00:02:21.260> really<00:02:21.590> woodland

hopefully this has been useful keep in

00:02:47.030 --> 00:02:48.880 
hopefully this has been useful keep in
mind<00:02:47.209> that<00:02:47.330> most<00:02:47.540> of<00:02:47.720> these<00:02:47.900> camouflages

00:02:48.880 --> 00:02:48.890 
mind that most of these camouflages

00:02:48.890 --> 00:02:50.650 
mind that most of these camouflages
you've<00:02:49.040> seen<00:02:49.310> here<00:02:49.610> almost<00:02:49.910> all<00:02:50.330> of<00:02:50.450> them<00:02:50.630> have

00:02:50.650 --> 00:02:50.660 
you've seen here almost all of them have

00:02:50.660 --> 00:02:52.870 
you've seen here almost all of them have
been<00:02:50.870> on<00:02:51.020> the<00:02:51.140> US<00:02:51.170> side<00:02:51.440> and<00:02:51.920> the<00:02:52.430> Russian<00:02:52.760> ones

00:02:54.250 --> 00:02:54.260 
might be different i'll have a look at

00:02:54.260 --> 00:02:55.990 
might be different i'll have a look at
doing<00:02:54.380> those<00:02:54.620> another<00:02:54.980> time<00:02:55.190> but<00:02:55.760> for<00:02:55.910> now

00:02:55.990 --> 00:02:56.000 
doing those another time but for now

00:02:56.000 --> 00:03:15.230 
doing those another time but for now
this<00:02:56.180> is<00:02:56.239> ephemeral<00:02:56.569> signing<00:02:57.140> out

00:03:15.230 --> 00:03:15.240 

00:03:15.240 --> 00:03:17.300
