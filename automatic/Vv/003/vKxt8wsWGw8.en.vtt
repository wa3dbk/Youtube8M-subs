00:00:17.540 --> 00:00:17.550 
here is two different types of brushes

00:00:17.550 --> 00:00:20.150 
here is two different types of brushes
when<00:00:18.029> deciding<00:00:18.449> on<00:00:18.660> which<00:00:18.869> brush<00:00:19.230> to<00:00:19.440> get<00:00:19.589> its

when deciding on which brush to get its

00:00:20.160 --> 00:00:22.880 
when deciding on which brush to get its
animal<00:00:20.699> hair<00:00:21.000> versus<00:00:21.539> synthetic<00:00:21.720> hair<00:00:22.349> so

00:00:22.880 --> 00:00:22.890 
animal hair versus synthetic hair so

00:00:22.890 --> 00:00:24.980 
animal hair versus synthetic hair so
animal<00:00:23.640> hair<00:00:23.820> is<00:00:23.910> the<00:00:24.029> traditional<00:00:24.630> brushes

00:00:24.980 --> 00:00:24.990 
animal hair is the traditional brushes

00:00:24.990 --> 00:00:26.570 
animal hair is the traditional brushes
that<00:00:25.169> were<00:00:25.259> first<00:00:25.529> made<00:00:25.800> of<00:00:26.009> course<00:00:26.279> with

00:00:26.570 --> 00:00:26.580 
that were first made of course with

00:00:26.580 --> 00:00:29.300 
that were first made of course with
animal<00:00:27.119> hair<00:00:27.330> so<00:00:27.869> with<00:00:28.050> those<00:00:28.259> you<00:00:29.009> have<00:00:29.279> to

00:00:29.300 --> 00:00:29.310 
animal hair so with those you have to

00:00:29.310 --> 00:00:31.099 
animal hair so with those you have to
definitely<00:00:29.640> make<00:00:29.910> sure<00:00:30.060> you<00:00:30.240> take<00:00:30.480> good<00:00:30.749> care

00:00:31.099 --> 00:00:31.109 
definitely make sure you take good care

00:00:31.109 --> 00:00:32.960 
definitely make sure you take good care
of<00:00:31.169> it<00:00:31.320> and<00:00:31.499> clean<00:00:31.679> it<00:00:31.769> often<00:00:32.189> now<00:00:32.550> the<00:00:32.610> great

00:00:32.960 --> 00:00:32.970 
of it and clean it often now the great

00:00:32.970 --> 00:00:35.210 
of it and clean it often now the great
thing<00:00:33.000> with<00:00:33.390> synthetic<00:00:34.050> brushes<00:00:34.800> is<00:00:35.070> their

00:00:35.210 --> 00:00:35.220 
thing with synthetic brushes is their

00:00:35.220 --> 00:00:36.950 
thing with synthetic brushes is their
main<00:00:35.430> attack<00:00:35.820> on<00:00:36.059> fibers<00:00:36.539> which<00:00:36.809> are

00:00:36.950 --> 00:00:36.960 
main attack on fibers which are

00:00:36.960 --> 00:00:40.279 
main attack on fibers which are
antibacterial<00:00:37.579> and<00:00:38.579> the<00:00:39.210> brushes<00:00:39.510> stay<00:00:39.960> so

00:00:40.279 --> 00:00:40.289 
antibacterial and the brushes stay so

00:00:40.289 --> 00:00:42.319 
antibacterial and the brushes stay so
much<00:00:40.590> softer<00:00:41.160> longer<00:00:41.609> than<00:00:41.789> animal<00:00:42.180> hair

00:00:42.319 --> 00:00:42.329 
much softer longer than animal hair

00:00:42.329 --> 00:00:45.590 
much softer longer than animal hair
brushes<00:00:42.750> also<00:00:43.680> with<00:00:43.980> synthetic<00:00:44.760> brushes<00:00:45.030> you

00:00:45.590 --> 00:00:45.600 
brushes also with synthetic brushes you

00:00:45.600 --> 00:00:48.770 
brushes also with synthetic brushes you
can<00:00:45.840> use<00:00:46.140> the<00:00:46.770> same<00:00:47.100> brush<00:00:47.489> for<00:00:47.940> dual<00:00:48.269> function

00:00:48.770 --> 00:00:48.780 
can use the same brush for dual function

00:00:48.780 --> 00:00:50.840 
can use the same brush for dual function
so<00:00:49.050> right<00:00:49.289> here<00:00:49.500> I'm<00:00:49.620> using<00:00:49.800> a<00:00:50.129> powder

00:00:50.840 --> 00:00:50.850 
so right here I'm using a powder

00:00:50.850 --> 00:00:53.119 
so right here I'm using a powder
synthetic<00:00:51.690> brush<00:00:51.930> to<00:00:52.350> apply<00:00:52.649> a<00:00:52.680> liquid

00:00:53.119 --> 00:00:53.129 
synthetic brush to apply a liquid

00:00:53.129 --> 00:00:55.160 
synthetic brush to apply a liquid
foundation<00:00:53.489> which<00:00:54.180> actually<00:00:54.719> gives<00:00:54.960> an

00:00:55.160 --> 00:00:55.170 
foundation which actually gives an

00:00:55.170 --> 00:00:56.090 
foundation which actually gives an
airbrush<00:00:55.649> finish

00:00:56.090 --> 00:00:56.100 
airbrush finish

00:00:56.100 --> 00:00:59.299 
airbrush finish
streak-free<00:00:56.960> glorious<00:00:57.989> finish<00:00:58.620> on<00:00:58.829> your<00:00:59.070> face

00:00:59.299 --> 00:00:59.309 
streak-free glorious finish on your face

00:00:59.309 --> 00:01:03.139 
streak-free glorious finish on your face
so<00:01:00.210> and<00:01:00.719> you'll<00:01:01.350> see<00:01:01.589> me<00:01:01.769> later<00:01:02.070> clean<00:01:02.760> it<00:01:02.969> and

00:01:03.139 --> 00:01:03.149 
so and you'll see me later clean it and

00:01:03.149 --> 00:01:05.119 
so and you'll see me later clean it and
then<00:01:03.239> I'm<00:01:03.570> going<00:01:03.839> to<00:01:03.899> use<00:01:04.199> the<00:01:04.470> same<00:01:04.739> brush

00:01:05.119 --> 00:01:05.129 
then I'm going to use the same brush

00:01:05.129 --> 00:01:08.120 
then I'm going to use the same brush
with<00:01:05.880> a<00:01:06.150> powder<00:01:06.510> so<00:01:07.080> that<00:01:07.110> dual<00:01:07.560> function

00:01:08.120 --> 00:01:08.130 
with a powder so that dual function

00:01:08.130 --> 00:01:10.910 
with a powder so that dual function
makes<00:01:08.580> it<00:01:08.790> really<00:01:09.090> easy<00:01:09.420> to<00:01:09.600> use<00:01:09.750> brushes<00:01:10.560> for

00:01:10.910 --> 00:01:10.920 
makes it really easy to use brushes for

00:01:10.920 --> 00:01:13.160 
makes it really easy to use brushes for
more<00:01:11.190> than<00:01:11.400> one<00:01:11.580> product<00:01:12.090> so<00:01:12.720> when<00:01:13.020> you're

00:01:13.160 --> 00:01:13.170 
more than one product so when you're

00:01:13.170 --> 00:01:15.350 
more than one product so when you're
making<00:01:13.410> a<00:01:13.740> decision<00:01:13.770> on<00:01:14.490> what<00:01:14.700> it<00:01:14.790> brushes<00:01:15.210> to

00:01:15.350 --> 00:01:15.360 
making a decision on what it brushes to

00:01:15.360 --> 00:01:17.960 
making a decision on what it brushes to
get<00:01:15.480> make<00:01:15.930> sure<00:01:15.960> you<00:01:16.230> pay<00:01:16.830> attention<00:01:16.860> to<00:01:17.820> the

00:01:17.960 --> 00:01:17.970 
get make sure you pay attention to the

00:01:17.970 --> 00:01:19.310 
get make sure you pay attention to the
hair<00:01:18.210> type<00:01:18.480> if<00:01:18.720> you<00:01:18.870> want<00:01:19.050> to<00:01:19.170> choose

00:01:19.310 --> 00:01:19.320 
hair type if you want to choose

00:01:19.320 --> 00:01:25.400 
hair type if you want to choose
synthetic<00:01:19.950> or<00:01:20.100> animal<00:01:23.990> another<00:01:24.990> very

00:01:25.400 --> 00:01:25.410 
synthetic or animal another very

00:01:25.410 --> 00:01:27.470 
synthetic or animal another very
important<00:01:25.920> factor<00:01:26.040> when<00:01:26.430> considering<00:01:27.150> what

00:01:27.470 --> 00:01:27.480 
important factor when considering what

00:01:27.480 --> 00:01:29.980 
important factor when considering what
brush<00:01:27.990> to<00:01:28.200> use<00:01:28.410> is<00:01:28.650> actually<00:01:29.370> the<00:01:29.550> density

00:01:29.980 --> 00:01:29.990 
brush to use is actually the density

00:01:29.990 --> 00:01:32.870 
brush to use is actually the density
meaning<00:01:30.990> how<00:01:31.500> close<00:01:31.860> are<00:01:32.130> the<00:01:32.370> brush<00:01:32.580> hairs

00:01:32.870 --> 00:01:32.880 
meaning how close are the brush hairs

00:01:32.880 --> 00:01:36.020 
meaning how close are the brush hairs
together<00:01:33.150> so<00:01:33.990> for<00:01:34.200> example<00:01:34.770> if<00:01:34.950> you<00:01:35.490> have<00:01:35.730> a

00:01:36.020 --> 00:01:36.030 
together so for example if you have a

00:01:36.030 --> 00:01:38.750 
together so for example if you have a
loose<00:01:36.840> brush<00:01:37.290> hair<00:01:37.650> like<00:01:37.950> a<00:01:37.980> fluffier<00:01:38.640> brush

00:01:38.750 --> 00:01:38.760 
loose brush hair like a fluffier brush

00:01:38.760 --> 00:01:41.330 
loose brush hair like a fluffier brush
that's<00:01:39.600> less<00:01:39.960> dense<00:01:40.320> and<00:01:40.650> that's<00:01:40.920> good<00:01:41.310> for

00:01:41.330 --> 00:01:41.340 
that's less dense and that's good for

00:01:41.340 --> 00:01:45.140 
that's less dense and that's good for
using<00:01:42.030> like<00:01:42.870> a<00:01:42.900> lower<00:01:43.860> coverage<00:01:44.400> of<00:01:44.670> products

00:01:45.140 --> 00:01:45.150 
using like a lower coverage of products

00:01:45.150 --> 00:01:46.880 
using like a lower coverage of products
so<00:01:45.240> say<00:01:45.450> if<00:01:45.570> you<00:01:45.690> want<00:01:45.870> to<00:01:45.930> use<00:01:46.050> a<00:01:46.080> translucent

00:01:46.880 --> 00:01:46.890 
so say if you want to use a translucent

00:01:46.890 --> 00:01:48.710 
so say if you want to use a translucent
powder<00:01:47.160> to<00:01:47.340> set<00:01:47.670> your<00:01:47.850> foundation<00:01:48.060> you<00:01:48.600> will

00:01:48.710 --> 00:01:48.720 
powder to set your foundation you will

00:01:48.720 --> 00:01:52.010 
powder to set your foundation you will
use<00:01:48.870> a<00:01:48.900> fluffier<00:01:49.620> less<00:01:50.310> dense<00:01:50.730> brush<00:01:51.120> and<00:01:51.480> then

00:01:52.010 --> 00:01:52.020 
use a fluffier less dense brush and then

00:01:52.020 --> 00:01:54.560 
use a fluffier less dense brush and then
considering<00:01:52.920> for<00:01:53.280> a<00:01:53.310> more<00:01:53.640> dense<00:01:53.940> brush<00:01:54.270> say

00:01:54.560 --> 00:01:54.570 
considering for a more dense brush say

00:01:54.570 --> 00:01:57.920 
considering for a more dense brush say
if<00:01:54.720> you<00:01:54.930> want<00:01:55.260> to<00:01:55.470> do<00:01:55.890> like<00:01:56.070> a<00:01:56.280> precise<00:01:57.240> smoky

00:01:57.920 --> 00:01:57.930 
if you want to do like a precise smoky

00:01:57.930 --> 00:01:59.900 
if you want to do like a precise smoky
eye<00:01:57.960> you're<00:01:58.590> gonna<00:01:58.710> use<00:01:58.920> a<00:01:58.950> very<00:01:59.370> dense

00:01:59.900 --> 00:01:59.910 
eye you're gonna use a very dense

00:01:59.910 --> 00:02:02.840 
eye you're gonna use a very dense
eyeshadow<00:02:00.720> brush<00:02:01.080> that's<00:02:01.620> basically<00:02:02.190> how<00:02:02.820> you

00:02:02.840 --> 00:02:02.850 
eyeshadow brush that's basically how you
