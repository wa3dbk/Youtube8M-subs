00:00:13.040 --> 00:00:15.440
 Sleeve (part 1) 

00:00:17.080 --> 00:00:19.680
 This is the sleeve 

00:00:20.400 --> 00:00:23.000
 We do so sleeves 

00:00:23.200 --> 00:00:26.400
 Here we put a piece of hot and sticky cloth 

00:00:27.080 --> 00:00:32.680
 It’s a small piece of cloth that helps me make a buttonhole. 

00:00:32.880 --> 00:00:35.480
 This is a piece of cloth that is sticky in heat. 

00:00:35.720 --> 00:00:37.920
 Use it for padding 

00:00:39.800 --> 00:00:44.800
 Let the side fold up about one cent and a half 

00:00:47.000 --> 00:00:49.200
 Such a rough seam 

00:00:52.600 --> 00:00:55.400
 Rough work 

00:00:55.600 --> 00:00:58.800
 Should stand and do 

00:00:59.040 --> 00:01:00.920
 Then sit down 

00:01:01.120 --> 00:01:04.920
 Do a good job 

00:01:05.120 --> 00:01:07.520
 Horizontal seam 

00:01:08.600 --> 00:01:11.600
 This job is a lot of people 

00:01:12.600 --> 00:01:15.600
 No need to do it by hand 

00:01:15.800 --> 00:01:20.600
 Use a thin camel hair pad... 

00:01:20.800 --> 00:01:23.480
 I am willing to let the sleeves 

00:01:23.680 --> 00:01:27.480
 Sense of structure 

00:01:27.720 --> 00:01:31.320
 Enriched and not loose 

00:01:31.520 --> 00:01:33.920
 Then you can't... 

00:01:34.160 --> 00:01:37.360
 Once people put this 

00:01:37.560 --> 00:01:39.560
 In French 

00:01:39.760 --> 00:01:41.760
 Changeant 

00:01:43.200 --> 00:01:45.200
 At that time 

00:01:45.400 --> 00:01:47.800
 Some cloth 

00:01:48.040 --> 00:01:50.640
 Heavy 

00:01:50.840 --> 00:01:53.840
 500 g 

00:01:54.040 --> 00:01:58.440
 And now it's a pity that some fabrics are too light. 

00:01:58.640 --> 00:02:01.320
 therefore…… 

00:02:01.520 --> 00:02:05.120
 Such a liner is no longer useful. 

00:02:06.960 --> 00:02:09.960
 This is the bottom of the sleeve 

00:02:12.200 --> 00:02:14.600
 Fold by hand 

00:02:14.800 --> 00:02:17.800
 First effort 

00:02:18.000 --> 00:02:21.600
 Do external 

00:02:22.200 --> 00:02:24.600
 Softer 

00:02:24.800 --> 00:02:27.000
 Compared with the interior 

00:02:27.200 --> 00:02:30.080
 why is it like this 

00:02:30.280 --> 00:02:32.360
 Because if the sleeves are not like this 

00:02:32.560 --> 00:02:35.960
 a buttonhole 

00:02:36.160 --> 00:02:38.560
 Will rise up 

00:02:38.760 --> 00:02:40.960
 Not uplifting 

00:02:41.160 --> 00:02:44.360
 Is the result of the sleeves turning outwards like this 

00:02:44.800 --> 00:02:47.600
 And do it by hand 

00:02:47.800 --> 00:02:52.000
 Use a cloth that is sticky under heat 

00:02:52.200 --> 00:02:57.480
 As a liner reinforcement is very stable and effective 

00:02:57.680 --> 00:03:01.960
 Avoid all those 

00:03:02.160 --> 00:03:04.760
 Annoying shortcomings 

00:03:06.560 --> 00:03:08.560
 Overall 

00:03:08.760 --> 00:03:13.160
 The sleeve should look like a box cover 

00:03:14.000 --> 00:03:18.080
 If the box is large, it should be big. 

00:03:18.280 --> 00:03:20.880
 In this case 

00:03:21.120 --> 00:03:24.320
 Sleeve is relatively small 

00:03:24.520 --> 00:03:27.720
 Generally in tailor shops 

00:03:27.920 --> 00:03:32.120
 Tend to make the sleeves bigger 

00:03:33.400 --> 00:03:36.000
 Make the whole soft 

00:03:36.200 --> 00:03:39.600
 This can produce a little pleat 

00:03:39.800 --> 00:03:43.600
 Indeed some of my clients said to me 

00:03:43.800 --> 00:03:48.000
 How can these pleats appear? 

00:03:48.200 --> 00:03:52.600
 Actually, I did it on purpose. 

00:03:52.800 --> 00:03:54.800
 This effect 

00:03:55.000 --> 00:03:57.400
 Because I don't want it 

00:03:57.600 --> 00:04:02.400
 Just add the active part below the pad 

00:04:02.640 --> 00:04:06.440
 Just lift the sleeves up. 

00:04:06.640 --> 00:04:09.240
 And I prefer to let the sleeves 

00:04:09.440 --> 00:04:12.040
 Look 

00:04:12.240 --> 00:04:14.640
 Interface like shirt sleeve 

00:04:14.840 --> 00:04:19.440
 Integrated with the shoulders 

00:04:19.640 --> 00:04:23.840
 This is the opinion problem depends on the tailor 

00:04:24.040 --> 00:04:26.040
 After this work is completed 

00:04:26.240 --> 00:04:30.440
 Buttonhole with buttonhole machine 

00:04:31.800 --> 00:04:34.600
 Stitch and lining the sleeves
