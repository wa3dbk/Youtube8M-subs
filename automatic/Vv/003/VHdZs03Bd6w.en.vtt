00:00:34.530 --> 00:00:37.860
 nice things we can talk about 

00:00:36.090 --> 00:00:40.320
 and Michael tells and now one 

00:00:37.860 --> 00:00:42.360
 that's just what it is

00:00:44.340 --> 00:00:48.360
 Share the earth already sold here in

 america, the market launch is imminent 

00:00:48.360 --> 00:00:50.640
 before 

00:00:49.010 --> 00:00:52.620
 accordingly here on our stand 

00:00:50.640 --> 00:00:54.210
 on the ces also featured relatively strong 

00:00:52.620 --> 00:00:55.260
 maybe this must be part of the story 

00:00:54.210 --> 00:00:58.590
 have a phone 

00:00:55.260 --> 00:01:00.359
 the ceo of lg said who my so 

00:00:58.590 --> 00:01:02.430
 a lot of innovative power in the company 

00:01:00.359 --> 00:01:04.049
 be it in display development now 

00:01:02.430 --> 00:01:05.850
 or even in battery development 

00:01:04.049 --> 00:01:07.909
 battery development that's what we want 

00:01:05.850 --> 00:01:10.470
 actually everything in a room 

00:01:07.909 --> 00:01:12.869
 connect and combine and 

00:01:10.470 --> 00:01:15.330
 The result is the optimus chat and 

00:01:12.869 --> 00:01:16.860
 really unbelievably clear display with 

00:01:15.330 --> 00:01:18.840
 a new display technology that 

00:01:16.860 --> 00:01:20.250
 It does not matter how you move your finger 

00:01:18.840 --> 00:01:22.439
 really has the feeling that I am with the 

00:01:20.250 --> 00:01:24.630
 to be finger in the colors of course 

00:01:22.439 --> 00:01:27.150
 an extremely high resolution known by 

00:01:24.630 --> 00:01:29.280
 the ips displays and a few really 

00:01:27.150 --> 00:01:33.829
 really cool features for the 

00:01:29.280 --> 00:01:36.540
 For example, here are dancing children 

00:01:33.829 --> 00:01:38.460
 and if he's always nice if that 

00:01:36.540 --> 00:01:42.659
 own child with dancing you have the 

00:01:38.460 --> 00:01:44.670
 possibility during the video that 

00:01:42.659 --> 00:01:45.479
 to bring your own child is that 

00:01:44.670 --> 00:01:48.689
 now a daughter 

00:01:45.479 --> 00:01:50.399
 and you see the resemblance is 

00:01:48.689 --> 00:01:53.460
 similarity is striking 

00:01:50.399 --> 00:01:56.610
 you actually see a possible 

00:01:53.460 --> 00:01:59.159
 Live streaming in the video to do other things 

00:01:56.610 --> 00:02:02.390
 cool feature is i crawl sms 

00:01:59.159 --> 00:02:04.640
 But I did not like a movie anymore 

00:02:02.390 --> 00:02:07.420
 to interrupt the film and have the 

00:02:04.640 --> 00:02:09.319
 possibility between the two screens 

00:02:07.420 --> 00:02:11.510
 parallel hearts are against cool 

00:02:09.319 --> 00:02:15.110
 stays that means I look the 

00:02:11.510 --> 00:02:16.760
 possibility to open the sms story 

00:02:15.110 --> 00:02:18.920
 and if I want to keep watching the movie 

00:02:16.760 --> 00:02:20.690
 I just put back in order so 

00:02:18.920 --> 00:02:22.690
 in fact, it's really true 

00:02:20.690 --> 00:02:25.730
 multitasking real multitasking 

00:02:22.690 --> 00:02:27.620
 no matter what you are there a few at the same time 

00:02:25.730 --> 00:02:31.610
 quite good stories quickmail jauch 

00:02:27.620 --> 00:02:38.770
 maybe already known I write 

00:02:31.610 --> 00:02:41.450
 john writes a number on accepted 

00:02:38.770 --> 00:02:44.120
 and it is played directly or the 

00:02:41.450 --> 00:02:45.980
 contact with canteen demonstrates that 

00:02:44.120 --> 00:02:47.360
 must make colleague because we cost 

00:02:45.980 --> 00:02:49.880
 trainer more about the ferry on 

00:02:47.360 --> 00:02:51.680
 more dangerous said but the device is coming 

00:02:49.880 --> 00:02:53.239
 Now we have Germany 

00:02:51.680 --> 00:02:55.010
 We look forward to it and will be very happy 

00:02:53.239 --> 00:02:56.600
 Of course in Barcelona too has MBC 

00:02:55.010 --> 00:02:57.950
 the whole amount learn about it super 

00:02:56.600 --> 00:02:59.390
 there we are in any case again 

00:02:57.950 --> 00:03:01.519
 However, I wish I had even a 

00:02:59.390 --> 00:03:02.959
 so small question about the area smartphone 

00:03:01.519 --> 00:03:05.000
 so lg 

00:03:02.959 --> 00:03:06.350
 we have such a feeling 

00:03:05.000 --> 00:03:08.470
 the next game he is with google 

00:03:06.350 --> 00:03:10.370
 the image was built a bit 

00:03:08.470 --> 00:03:12.200
 was not injured 

00:03:10.370 --> 00:03:14.540
 So we often had such reactions yes 

00:03:12.200 --> 00:03:16.700
 Result does not know exactly now 

00:03:14.540 --> 00:03:18.079
 the other way round it was mine 

00:03:16.700 --> 00:03:19.370
 opinion to the donor has the people 

00:03:18.079 --> 00:03:21.280
 are very satisfied with the device are 

00:03:19.370 --> 00:03:23.510
 a very cheap very good device 

00:03:21.280 --> 00:03:25.430
 can you say something like that for like this 

00:03:23.510 --> 00:03:27.860
 lg itself is so cooperative with 

00:03:25.430 --> 00:03:28.940
 google and son really vaccination too 

00:03:27.860 --> 00:03:31.220
 do that with pure android 

00:03:28.940 --> 00:03:32.959
 equipped is so natural, of course 

00:03:31.220 --> 00:03:34.610
 Already good for the brand when google yourself 

00:03:32.959 --> 00:03:36.680
 For us, I decide Sunday 

00:03:34.610 --> 00:03:38.180
 made aware of some hardware 

00:03:36.680 --> 00:03:40.160
 always really right at the front 

00:03:38.180 --> 00:03:42.320
 We have been one of the 

00:03:40.160 --> 00:03:44.989
 We are the world's leading display manufacturer 

00:03:42.320 --> 00:03:46.579
 have good interface user interface 

00:03:44.989 --> 00:03:48.410
 what we have to work on surely 

00:03:46.579 --> 00:03:50.690
 update policy and also the communication 

00:03:48.410 --> 00:03:53.090
 but I have that kind of politics 

00:03:50.690 --> 00:03:54.950
 believe that we have learned 

00:03:53.090 --> 00:03:57.200
 now understand and have to mwc in 

00:03:54.950 --> 00:03:59.000
 barcelona the end of february certainly too 

00:03:57.200 --> 00:04:00.799
 can also make strategic statements 

00:03:59.000 --> 00:04:03.180
 make statements on the products 

00:04:00.799 --> 00:04:04.620
 which are actually sustainable 

00:04:03.180 --> 00:04:07.799
 and bring us further forward 

00:04:04.620 --> 00:04:09.120
 this is our clear goal and you 

00:04:07.799 --> 00:04:12.629
 may not forget a thing 

00:04:09.120 --> 00:04:14.519
 minded world continues group and europe 

00:04:12.629 --> 00:04:16.859
 is a part of this world we are in 

00:04:14.519 --> 00:04:19.139
 other markets are already much further 

00:04:16.859 --> 00:04:20.940
 as in europe and there is the 

00:04:19.139 --> 00:04:23.580
 Demanding market and is also good 

00:04:20.940 --> 00:04:25.820
 learned for us even when we are on the 

00:04:23.580 --> 00:04:28.410
 but listen European customer he 

00:04:25.820 --> 00:04:30.419
 focuses on the world market in 

00:04:28.410 --> 00:04:32.460
 the end effect and there is that europe 

00:04:30.419 --> 00:04:34.320
 at least the statement that we from korea 

00:04:32.460 --> 00:04:36.750
 hear david europe future one 

00:04:34.320 --> 00:04:37.889
 play a more important role and for that 

00:04:36.750 --> 00:04:40.080
 Of course we work in too 

00:04:37.889 --> 00:04:41.729
 Germany that means 2013 can 

00:04:40.080 --> 00:04:44.400
 we from lg a bit something 

00:04:41.729 --> 00:04:46.139
 expect mwc then yes is still cebit 

00:04:44.400 --> 00:04:47.490
 probably the one or the other 

00:04:46.139 --> 00:04:50.009
 other beautiful things just in the 

00:04:47.490 --> 00:04:51.690
