everything seems to be 720p I but you
know<00:01:26.630> I<00:01:26.810> think<00:01:26.869> that<00:01:27.320> is<00:01:27.920> really<00:01:28.220> just<00:01:28.520> a

00:01:28.630 --> 00:01:28.640 
know I think that is really just a

00:01:28.640 --> 00:01:35.560 
know I think that is really just a
netflix<00:01:29.440> service<00:01:30.640> limitation<00:01:34.060> and<00:01:35.060> here<00:01:35.450> you

00:01:35.560 --> 00:01:35.570 
netflix service limitation and here you

00:01:35.570 --> 00:01:41.109

00:01:41.109 --> 00:01:41.119 
can see the transport control just lists

00:01:41.119 --> 00:01:46.389 
can see the transport control just lists
everything<00:01:41.360> in<00:01:41.600> minutes<00:01:41.929> no<00:01:42.789> seconds<00:01:45.399> you

everything in minutes no seconds you

00:01:46.399 --> 00:01:50.590 
everything in minutes no seconds you
know<00:01:46.490> if<00:01:46.610> you<00:01:46.869> fast-forward<00:01:47.950> or<00:01:49.300> this<00:01:50.300> is<00:01:50.450> that

00:01:50.590 --> 00:01:50.600 
know if you fast-forward or this is that

00:01:50.600 --> 00:01:51.999 
know if you fast-forward or this is that
I'm<00:01:50.750> actually<00:01:50.899> pressing<00:01:51.320> the<00:01:51.560> right<00:01:51.770> arrow

00:01:51.999 --> 00:01:52.009 
I'm actually pressing the right arrow

00:01:58.330 --> 00:01:58.340 
you are in the content of course when I

00:01:58.340 --> 00:02:00.130 
you are in the content of course when I
do<00:01:58.429> this<00:01:58.849> it's<00:01:59.090> going<00:01:59.179> to<00:01:59.270> have<00:01:59.390> to<00:01:59.420> buffer<00:01:59.989> up

00:02:00.130 --> 00:02:00.140 
do this it's going to have to buffer up

00:02:00.140 --> 00:02:03.460 
do this it's going to have to buffer up
again<00:02:01.390> sometimes<00:02:02.390> usually<00:02:02.630> when<00:02:02.929> you<00:02:03.020> do<00:02:03.259> this

00:02:03.460 --> 00:02:03.470 
again sometimes usually when you do this

00:02:03.470 --> 00:02:12.100 
again sometimes usually when you do this
it<00:02:04.369> doesn't<00:02:04.789> take<00:02:05.179> too<00:02:05.599> long<00:02:10.720> it's<00:02:11.720> probably

00:02:12.100 --> 00:02:12.110 
it doesn't take too long it's probably

00:02:12.110 --> 00:02:14.229 
it doesn't take too long it's probably
going<00:02:12.410> to<00:02:12.470> be<00:02:12.530> about<00:02:12.590> 20<00:02:13.130> seconds<00:02:13.550> here<00:02:13.819> which

00:02:14.229 --> 00:02:14.239 
going to be about 20 seconds here which

00:02:14.239 --> 00:02:16.720 
going to be about 20 seconds here which
things<00:02:14.480> about<00:02:14.709> most<00:02:15.709> of<00:02:15.950> the<00:02:16.069> time<00:02:16.280> it<00:02:16.580> does

00:02:16.720 --> 00:02:16.730 
things about most of the time it does

00:02:16.730 --> 00:02:19.809 
things about most of the time it does
take<00:02:16.970> about<00:02:17.090> 20<00:02:17.510> seconds<00:02:17.900> to<00:02:18.080> buffer<00:02:18.819> things

00:02:19.809 --> 00:02:19.819 
take about 20 seconds to buffer things

00:02:19.819 --> 00:02:27.430 
take about 20 seconds to buffer things
up<00:02:24.280> speaking<00:02:25.280> of<00:02:25.310> the<00:02:25.430> buffering<00:02:25.819> it<00:02:26.000> it<00:02:26.120> it<00:02:26.780> is

00:02:27.430 --> 00:02:27.440 
up speaking of the buffering it it it is

00:02:27.440 --> 00:02:28.960 
up speaking of the buffering it it it is
a<00:02:27.470> little<00:02:27.920> bit<00:02:28.129> annoying<00:02:28.430> I<00:02:28.670> think<00:02:28.849> you'll

00:02:28.960 --> 00:02:28.970 
a little bit annoying I think you'll

00:02:28.970 --> 00:02:33.160 
a little bit annoying I think you'll
kind<00:02:29.180> of<00:02:29.270> see<00:02:29.540> here<00:02:30.290> but<00:02:31.250> really<00:02:31.840> most<00:02:32.840> of<00:02:33.110> the

00:02:33.160 --> 00:02:33.170 
kind of see here but really most of the

00:02:33.170 --> 00:02:34.839 
kind of see here but really most of the
time<00:02:33.379> if<00:02:33.560> you're<00:02:33.709> just<00:02:33.860> going<00:02:33.980> to<00:02:34.040> watch<00:02:34.220> a

00:02:34.839 --> 00:02:34.849 
time if you're just going to watch a

00:02:34.849 --> 00:02:37.839 
time if you're just going to watch a
longer<00:02:35.599> program<00:02:36.080> it's<00:02:36.739> not<00:02:36.980> going<00:02:37.099> to<00:02:37.190> be<00:02:37.340> too

00:02:37.839 --> 00:02:37.849 
longer program it's not going to be too

00:02:37.849 --> 00:02:41.800 
longer program it's not going to be too
I<00:02:38.120> wouldn't<00:02:38.569> be<00:02:38.660> too<00:02:38.810> concerned<00:02:38.840> with<00:02:39.379> it<00:02:40.810> but

00:02:41.800 --> 00:02:41.810 
I wouldn't be too concerned with it but

00:02:41.810 --> 00:02:43.390 
I wouldn't be too concerned with it but
when<00:02:41.989> you're<00:02:42.140> switching<00:02:42.349> back<00:02:42.650> and<00:02:42.680> forth<00:02:42.950> if
