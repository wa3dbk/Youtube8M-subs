00:00:02.130 --> 00:00:07.000
 hello hobby cooks nice that you again 

00:00:04.690 --> 00:00:10.780
 we have turned on today 

00:00:07.000 --> 00:00:12.280
 together at sattmacher bread it is too 

00:00:10.780 --> 00:00:16.630
 for me the first time I do that 

00:00:12.280 --> 00:00:19.270
 do because who does not know the situation 

00:00:16.630 --> 00:00:20.590
 you get up in the morning to the closet 

00:00:19.270 --> 00:00:22.990
 where the boat is 

00:00:20.590 --> 00:00:25.900
 or because of me also in the evening to eat a lot 

00:00:22.990 --> 00:00:30.250
 also from bread and then you discover in 

00:00:25.900 --> 00:00:35.680
 a cupboard only the empty bag and 

00:00:30.250 --> 00:00:36.220
 thinks well where is my bread now 

00:00:35.680 --> 00:00:38.829
 here 

00:00:36.220 --> 00:00:41.920
 the answer is we do a lot ourselves 

00:00:38.829 --> 00:00:43.980
 enjoy video and do not need 

00:00:41.920 --> 00:00:50.010
 many days we need baking powder 

00:00:43.980 --> 00:00:52.030
 then quark was salted 

00:00:50.010 --> 00:00:53.680
 Oatmeal I have here now 

00:00:52.030 --> 00:00:55.000
 spelled oats you can do too 

00:00:53.680 --> 00:00:58.000
 take the normal ones 

00:00:55.000 --> 00:00:59.620
 one takes best peanuts I have as 

00:00:58.000 --> 00:01:02.920
 but only on one sheet 

00:00:59.620 --> 00:01:05.530
 there and hope that still works and if 

00:01:02.920 --> 00:01:07.329
 your best bet is a silicone mold 

00:01:05.530 --> 00:01:09.490
 but you can also have a box 

00:01:07.329 --> 00:01:10.709
 make because silicone mold has now 

00:01:09.490 --> 00:01:12.729
 here are a few waves 

00:01:10.709 --> 00:01:14.969
 but that's not so bad if that 

00:01:12.729 --> 00:01:19.029
 bread then has a bit of structure 

00:01:14.969 --> 00:01:21.099
 those are the ingredients so me 

00:01:19.029 --> 00:01:24.759
 I already have the oven on 180 

00:01:21.099 --> 00:01:26.529
 I have always done that 

00:01:24.759 --> 00:01:28.689
 I do not know how she does that 

00:01:26.529 --> 00:01:31.179
 settles on it and 80 degrees and I have 

00:01:28.689 --> 00:01:32.979
 my picked out a kitchen machine 

00:01:31.179 --> 00:01:35.139
 but they can do that with the whole 

00:01:32.979 --> 00:01:36.669
 normal hand mixer I hope 

00:01:35.139 --> 00:01:40.149
 You can see that, I hope you can 

00:01:36.669 --> 00:01:42.520
 the city is now set 

00:01:40.149 --> 00:01:44.380
 actually just the whole 

00:01:42.520 --> 00:01:47.189
 ingredients to mix so and that can 

00:01:44.380 --> 00:01:47.189
 he really everybody 

00:01:52.030 --> 00:02:08.979
 a spoonful of mine is now net 

00:02:03.340 --> 00:02:20.380
 but that does not matter to anyone else 

00:02:08.979 --> 00:02:22.680
 Politicians take then we go the pure 

00:02:20.380 --> 00:02:22.680
 to 

00:02:31.330 --> 00:02:34.890
 then in a teaspoon of salt 

00:02:38.280 --> 00:02:52.610
 That's how the eggs come and go 

00:02:50.010 --> 00:03:01.890
 good last come now euro 

00:02:52.610 --> 00:03:05.400
 Oatmeal to it and now it still works 

00:03:01.890 --> 00:03:10.310
 everything together does not shorten 

00:03:05.400 --> 00:03:10.310
 and knead a nice day 

00:03:12.180 --> 00:03:17.620
 that's what it looks like and everything 

00:03:15.030 --> 00:03:21.549
 It's cold, it's not right 

00:03:17.620 --> 00:03:22.329
 but it's all about saying it 

00:03:21.549 --> 00:03:26.170
 connected 

00:03:22.329 --> 00:03:29.530
 and now that comes in the casserole dish 

00:03:26.170 --> 00:03:32.409
 should already have the baking pan so I 

00:03:29.530 --> 00:03:35.829
 I prefer to take a silicone mold because of me 

00:03:32.409 --> 00:03:38.889
 then do not grease the whole and 

00:03:35.829 --> 00:03:43.840
 Now let's try this in here 

00:03:38.889 --> 00:03:48.250
 always curious that's how 

00:03:43.840 --> 00:03:51.959
 it is a delicious bread one the 

00:03:48.250 --> 00:03:51.959
 experiment with you together 

00:03:55.520 --> 00:04:04.060
 I'm going to rest now here nor there 

00:03:58.610 --> 00:04:06.830
 distribute is good press 

00:04:04.060 --> 00:04:08.480
 I have that now everything again with 

00:04:06.830 --> 00:04:09.350
 a spoon I have a bit 

00:04:08.480 --> 00:04:11.150
 get wet 

00:04:09.350 --> 00:04:12.980
 smoothed out because that's a bit 

00:04:11.150 --> 00:04:14.230
 It's a bit harder too 

00:04:12.980 --> 00:04:17.299
 to distribute 

00:04:14.230 --> 00:04:21.290
 yes I'll see if I have to rupps 

00:04:17.299 --> 00:04:26.110
 closer to that, and now I can take it 

00:04:21.290 --> 00:04:26.110
 a few more oats and 

00:04:26.530 --> 00:04:35.210
 of course, it would be rougher but me 

00:04:32.570 --> 00:04:36.800
 have nothing else at home now and 

00:04:35.210 --> 00:04:39.050
 that is sometimes so you take 

00:04:36.800 --> 00:04:41.860
 no bread you have to take that 

00:04:39.050 --> 00:04:46.120
 What you have at home so much 

00:04:41.860 --> 00:04:51.260
 that I do it now so that 

00:04:46.120 --> 00:04:52.850
 like a few grains like that and pull that 

00:04:51.260 --> 00:04:53.540
 We now in the oven for one 

00:04:52.850 --> 00:04:56.870
 hour 

00:04:53.540 --> 00:05:00.410
 so people it is now out I think 

00:04:56.870 --> 00:05:02.000
 it's really good by 

00:05:00.410 --> 00:05:04.810
 It is quite simple now 

00:05:02.000 --> 00:05:08.630
 a little bit hot that 

00:05:04.810 --> 00:05:10.130
 I let it cool down now and then 

00:05:08.630 --> 00:05:12.920
 We can then my piece 

00:05:10.130 --> 00:05:15.080
 cut and then we'll look like 

00:05:12.920 --> 00:05:19.220
 It looks like it looks on everyone 

00:05:15.080 --> 00:05:23.360
 I think it's really good in July 

00:05:19.220 --> 00:05:25.160
 that they are really great and now 

00:05:23.360 --> 00:05:26.770
 i wanted you the beautiful brother i wanted 

00:05:25.160 --> 00:05:30.830
 do not see it at all 

00:05:26.770 --> 00:05:33.350
 that was a slice off me 

00:05:30.830 --> 00:05:36.520
 just look that is definitely 

00:05:33.350 --> 00:05:36.520
 very crispy 

00:05:39.220 --> 00:05:48.259
 zack while a piece of it looks like that inside 

00:05:44.090 --> 00:05:52.250
 in it from soft already in the edge is 

00:05:48.259 --> 00:05:53.960
 crispy in any case and inside 

00:05:52.250 --> 00:05:57.050
 very nice and even soft 

00:05:53.960 --> 00:05:59.960
 a bit warm and I'll show you 

00:05:57.050 --> 00:06:02.840
 the same I'll try it 

00:05:59.960 --> 00:06:04.460
 I hope I hope you had a recipe 

00:06:02.840 --> 00:06:09.970
 maybe you show the bread 

00:06:04.460 --> 00:06:12.139
 looking good is good 

00:06:09.970 --> 00:06:14.569
 it has some dents here because of me 

00:06:12.139 --> 00:06:21.039
 this is the form but I think that 

00:06:14.569 --> 00:06:21.039
 not bad at all and try twice 

00:06:25.509 --> 00:06:31.910
 tasted could not have imagined 

00:06:29.570 --> 00:06:39.070
 Get that out of this few ingredients 

00:06:31.910 --> 00:06:42.530
 is bread with a haferflocken 

00:06:39.070 --> 00:06:44.120
 but with me still has a bit 

00:06:42.530 --> 00:06:47.090
 intense taste because I think 

00:06:44.120 --> 00:06:51.320
 but you have taken oatmeal 

00:06:47.090 --> 00:06:55.130
 can not take the normal synonymous 

00:06:51.320 --> 00:06:58.190
 Yummy, I'm happy and I have 

00:06:55.130 --> 00:06:59.360
 Now bread again and then look forward to it 

00:06:58.190 --> 00:07:01.280
 to eat that morning 

00:06:59.360 --> 00:07:02.960
 Of course, as always, mine is mine 

00:07:01.280 --> 00:07:09.099
 player china already knows that 

00:07:02.960 --> 00:07:12.560
 annoying topic and I'm curious 

00:07:09.099 --> 00:07:17.750
 like the place so my husband and on 

00:07:12.560 --> 00:07:19.729
 weekend guests come to the 

00:07:17.750 --> 00:07:21.370
 brunch and then we'll see something 

00:07:19.729 --> 00:07:23.870
 it will become 

00:07:21.370 --> 00:07:26.180
 So I like it and I hope you 

00:07:23.870 --> 00:07:27.710
 do that or maybe you have 

00:07:26.180 --> 00:07:28.849
 you already did it then 

00:07:27.710 --> 00:07:30.349

00:07:28.849 --> 00:07:33.020
 comments and then I wish you 

00:07:30.349 --> 00:07:36.130
