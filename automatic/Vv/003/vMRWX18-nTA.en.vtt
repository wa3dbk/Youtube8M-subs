00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:01.609
 those in diameter 

00:00:01.609 --> 00:00:08.280
 will pass only 320 thousand kilometers from the earth ie a smaller distance alak 

00:00:08.280 --> 00:00:10.889
 it exists from the earth to the moon 

00:00:10.889 --> 00:00:15.830
 and that this is the maximum approach and the object of that size in many 

00:00:15.830 --> 00:00:17.070
 decades 

00:00:17.070 --> 00:00:20.980
 and that it may even be televised live 

00:00:22.369 --> 00:00:28.320
 I already knew it well yes no aquiles I invite you to know the details with Fernando 

00:00:28.320 --> 00:00:30.229
 belt 

00:00:30.229 --> 00:00:34.699
 on Tuesday November 8, 2011 at 23 hours and 28 minutes of the time 

00:00:34.699 --> 00:00:35.690
 universal 

00:00:35.690 --> 00:00:37.230
 the earth that you experience 

00:00:37.230 --> 00:00:42.570
 both a close encounter with the 2005 asteroid inspected at 1 55 

00:00:43.129 --> 00:00:47.129
 what will happen between the orbit of the moon and our planet an asteroid 

00:00:47.129 --> 00:00:53.350
 considered dangerous 400 meters in diameter that approximate 326 thousand 

00:00:53.350 --> 00:00:59.079
 740 km although it seems a lot in reality on a planetary scale it is a 

00:00:59.079 --> 00:01:01.019
 true close encounter 

00:01:01.019 --> 00:01:04.890
 astronomical observatories and radio telescopes are ready to 

00:01:04.890 --> 00:01:06.649
 observe permanently 

00:01:06.649 --> 00:01:11.999
 the approach of the asteroid and better monitor its trajectory including the 

00:01:11.999 --> 00:01:16.479
 space telescopes like the outside that observe the sun various chains of 

00:01:16.479 --> 00:01:19.499
 television plan to transmit live the maximum approach 

00:01:20.500 --> 00:01:25.250
 it is a reminder that our planet is usually impacted by these 

00:01:25.250 --> 00:01:26.990
 celestial bodies 

00:01:26.990 --> 00:01:31.670
 it is estimated that every ten million years an asteroid of 5 kilometers of 

00:01:31.670 --> 00:01:34.670
 diameter hits the ground 

00:01:34.670 --> 00:01:38.490
 the asteroids of a kilometer in diameter are impacted against our 

00:01:38.490 --> 00:01:44.710
 world every 500 thousand years the objects of 50 meters collide every 100 years against 

00:01:44.710 --> 00:01:45.430
 the earth 

00:01:45.430 --> 00:01:51.200
 something similar occurs in Tunguska in Siberia on June 30, 1908 when a 

00:01:51.200 --> 00:01:56.320
 fragment of the comet in which 80 meters entered the atmosphere generating a 

00:01:56.320 --> 00:02:01.070
 explosion that burned and felled trees in an area of ​​2 thousand 150 

00:02:01.070 --> 00:02:02.720
 square kilometers 

00:02:02.720 --> 00:02:07.260
 Statistically, more than 100 years have passed and it has not yet been registered 

00:02:07.260 --> 00:02:10.599
 an impact of some greater asteroid at 50 meters 

00:02:11.369 --> 00:02:14.819
 astronomers looking for potentially dangerous asteroids 

00:02:14.819 --> 00:02:20.889
 they calculate that there must be up to 30 thousand contradictory objects that go through 

00:02:20.889 --> 00:02:22.629
 the orbit of the earth 

00:02:22.629 --> 00:02:25.439
 until the end of April 2011 the nasa 

00:02:25.439 --> 00:02:29.060
 has found only one thousand 218 asteroids 

00:02:29.060 --> 00:02:32.209
 classified as potentially dangerous 

00:02:32.209 --> 00:02:38.739
 in this category are placed 2005 and vcc in account and 5 that was discovered 

00:02:38.739 --> 00:02:43.930
 by obermán aj milán astronomers of the space surveillance program on 28 

00:02:43.930 --> 00:02:49.280
 December 2005 in arizona united states one of the most observations 

00:02:49.280 --> 00:02:55.260
 detailed information was made from April 19 to 21, 2010 with the radio telescope of 

00:02:55.260 --> 00:03:01.000
 Arecibo in Puerto Rico confirmed that it is a Tinelli asteroid 400 meters 

00:03:01.000 --> 00:03:02.830
 being almost spherical 

00:03:02.830 --> 00:03:04.060
 and very dark 

00:03:04.060 --> 00:03:08.550
 It rotates on its axis every 20 hours and it is ruled that it is a 

00:03:08.550 --> 00:03:12.540
 asteroid type c that is a national coal asteroid 

00:03:12.540 --> 00:03:16.999
 few asteroids are known whose trajectories are directed towards the Earth 

00:03:16.999 --> 00:03:21.980
 the most dangerous of all was discovered on June 19, 2004 is the asteroid 

00:03:21.979 --> 00:03:28.669
 2004 nn 4 of almost 300 meters in diameter - known as possible 

00:03:28.669 --> 00:03:32.679
 could collide with the world on April 13, 2029 

00:03:33.799 --> 00:03:37.549
 for this type of asteroids humanity has the possibility of 

00:03:37.549 --> 00:03:40.549
 divert them using spacecraft 

00:03:41.589 --> 00:03:47.699
 with respect to the 0 and of 2005 and pfb counts and 5 observe this graph that shows the 

00:03:47.699 --> 00:03:50.339
 close encounter that the earth will experience 

00:03:50.339 --> 00:03:52.739
 on November 8, 2011 

00:03:52.739 --> 00:03:56.919
 191 days to observe closely this asteroid 

00:03:57.609 --> 00:04:02.120
 that will pass between the orbit of the moon and the earth heading to the constellation of 

00:04:02.119 --> 00:04:02.719
 pound 

00:04:02.719 --> 00:04:06.370
 besides that it will be watched in the great astronomical observatories 

00:04:07.290 --> 00:04:09.419
 with the space telescopes 

00:04:09.419 --> 00:04:12.419
 and with the largest radio telescopes in the world 

00:04:16.779 --> 00:04:21.579
 From this issue we will follow in detail the trajectory of this 

00:04:21.579 --> 00:04:22.990
 celestial body 

00:04:22.990 --> 00:04:27.850
 we will have all the information of the close encounter between the earth and the 

00:04:27.849 --> 00:04:31.110
 asteroid 2005 delivered 55
