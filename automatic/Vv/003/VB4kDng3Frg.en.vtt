repair the valve appropriately this is
the<00:00:26.690> usual<00:00:27.200> image<00:00:27.380> that<00:00:27.800> we<00:00:27.950> have<00:00:28.160> with<00:00:28.520> the

00:00:28.630 --> 00:00:28.640 
the usual image that we have with the

00:00:28.640 --> 00:00:30.140 
the usual image that we have with the
standard<00:00:29.060> equipment<00:00:29.390> that<00:00:29.690> we<00:00:29.810> have

00:00:30.140 --> 00:00:30.150 
standard equipment that we have

00:00:30.150 --> 00:00:33.930 
standard equipment that we have
and<00:00:31.140> then<00:00:31.410> with<00:00:31.590> a<00:00:31.620> few<00:00:31.970> manipulations<00:00:32.970> of

00:00:33.930 --> 00:00:33.940 
and then with a few manipulations of

00:00:33.940 --> 00:00:35.509 
and then with a few manipulations of
we<00:00:34.059> can<00:00:34.210> get<00:00:34.329> a<00:00:34.359> three-dimensional<00:00:35.109> picture

00:00:35.509 --> 00:00:35.519 
we can get a three-dimensional picture

00:00:35.519 --> 00:00:38.490 
we can get a three-dimensional picture
and<00:00:36.519> now<00:00:37.090> we're<00:00:37.300> going<00:00:37.480> to<00:00:37.570> create<00:00:37.899> an<00:00:38.260> image

00:00:38.490 --> 00:00:38.500 
and now we're going to create an image

00:00:38.500 --> 00:00:41.369 
and now we're going to create an image
that<00:00:38.680> looks<00:00:39.000> identical<00:00:40.000> to<00:00:40.030> what<00:00:40.449> dr.<00:00:41.079> Harris

00:00:41.369 --> 00:00:41.379 
that looks identical to what dr. Harris

00:00:41.379 --> 00:00:43.680 
that looks identical to what dr. Harris
is<00:00:41.500> going<00:00:41.710> to<00:00:41.769> see<00:00:42.070> when<00:00:42.879> he<00:00:42.969> opens<00:00:43.329> the<00:00:43.449> heart

00:00:43.680 --> 00:00:43.690 
is going to see when he opens the heart

00:00:43.690 --> 00:00:47.250 
is going to see when he opens the heart
to<00:00:43.930> do<00:00:44.110> its<00:00:44.320> repair<00:00:45.089> this<00:00:46.089> is<00:00:46.149> the<00:00:46.510> segment<00:00:46.780> of

00:00:47.250 --> 00:00:47.260 
to do its repair this is the segment of

with this he we were able to identify

00:01:00.729 --> 00:01:06.090 
with this he we were able to identify
that<00:01:01.180> segment<00:01:01.960> you<00:01:02.199> know<00:01:04.320> tremendous<00:01:05.320> more

00:01:06.090 --> 00:01:06.100 
that segment you know tremendous more

accuracy than we were able to do with

00:01:09.640 --> 00:01:12.840 
accuracy than we were able to do with
our<00:01:09.940> traditional<00:01:10.720> equipment<00:01:11.850> her

00:01:12.840 --> 00:01:12.850 
our traditional equipment her

cardiologist in the course of evaluating
her<00:01:18.850> got<00:01:19.539> an<00:01:19.659> echocardiogram<00:01:21.300> and<00:01:22.300> it<00:01:22.690> shows

00:01:22.980 --> 00:01:22.990 
her got an echocardiogram and it shows

00:01:22.990 --> 00:01:26.270 
her got an echocardiogram and it shows
that<00:01:23.590> her<00:01:23.800> mitral<00:01:24.069> valve<00:01:24.460> leaks<00:01:25.030> severely

00:01:26.270 --> 00:01:26.280 
that her mitral valve leaks severely

00:01:26.280 --> 00:01:32.160 
that her mitral valve leaks severely
perhaps<00:01:27.280> she<00:01:27.490> has<00:01:27.700> a<00:01:27.729> little<00:01:28.509> bit<00:01:28.720> of<00:01:28.780> a<00:01:31.170> mild

00:01:32.160 --> 00:01:32.170

and the only effective way to deal with

00:02:58.940 --> 00:03:02.230 
and the only effective way to deal with
it<00:02:59.090> is<00:02:59.210> with<00:02:59.390> surgery<00:03:00.520> there<00:03:01.520> are<00:03:01.610> two<00:03:01.790> ways<00:03:02.000> of

dealing with a leaking mitral valve one

00:03:04.550 --> 00:03:07.390 
dealing with a leaking mitral valve one
way<00:03:04.730> is<00:03:04.940> to<00:03:04.970> just<00:03:05.320> operate<00:03:06.320> on<00:03:06.620> a<00:03:06.680> patient<00:03:07.250> and

00:03:07.390 --> 00:03:07.400 
way is to just operate on a patient and

00:03:07.400 --> 00:03:09.490 
way is to just operate on a patient and
take<00:03:08.120> out<00:03:08.300> the<00:03:08.480> valve<00:03:08.690> and<00:03:09.020> put<00:03:09.140> in<00:03:09.260> a<00:03:09.380> new

00:03:09.490 --> 00:03:09.500 
take out the valve and put in a new

00:03:09.500 --> 00:03:13.270 
take out the valve and put in a new
valve<00:03:09.800> and<00:03:10.400> in<00:03:10.520> some<00:03:10.760> cases<00:03:11.030> that's<00:03:11.480> okay<00:03:12.280> but

00:03:13.270 --> 00:03:13.280 
valve and in some cases that's okay but

00:03:13.280 --> 00:03:18.010 
valve and in some cases that's okay but
there<00:03:14.090> are<00:03:14.390> a<00:03:14.630> lot<00:03:15.110> of<00:03:15.220> studies<00:03:16.220> again<00:03:17.020> with

00:03:18.010 --> 00:03:18.020 
there are a lot of studies again with

00:03:18.020 --> 00:03:20.110 
there are a lot of studies again with
hundreds<00:03:18.680> and<00:03:18.920> maybe<00:03:19.010> even<00:03:19.190> probably<00:03:19.850> really

00:03:20.110 --> 00:03:20.120 
hundreds and maybe even probably really

00:03:20.120 --> 00:03:22.630 
hundreds and maybe even probably really
thousands<00:03:20.600> of<00:03:20.690> patients<00:03:20.870> worth<00:03:21.800> of<00:03:21.980> data<00:03:22.160> that

thousands of patients worth of data that

00:03:22.640 --> 00:03:25.000 
thousands of patients worth of data that

00:03:28.900 --> 00:03:28.910 
their mitral valve have a better

00:03:42.070 --> 00:03:42.080 
valve and here at Baptist I I have a

00:03:42.080 --> 00:03:43.840 
valve and here at Baptist I I have a
special<00:03:42.530> interest<00:03:42.650> in<00:03:43.010> mitral<00:03:43.400> valve<00:03:43.580> surgery

00:03:43.840 --> 00:03:43.850 
special interest in mitral valve surgery

00:03:43.850 --> 00:03:47.410 
special interest in mitral valve surgery
and<00:03:45.430> particularly<00:03:46.430> repair<00:03:46.940> of<00:03:47.120> the<00:03:47.209> mitral

00:03:47.410 --> 00:03:47.420 
and particularly repair of the mitral

00:03:47.420 --> 00:03:50.350 
and particularly repair of the mitral
valve<00:03:47.780> and<00:03:47.989> so<00:03:48.230> we<00:03:48.440> don't<00:03:48.680> we<00:03:49.640> don't<00:03:49.790> replace

00:03:50.350 --> 00:03:50.360 
valve and so we don't we don't replace

00:03:50.360 --> 00:03:53.650 
valve and so we don't we don't replace
many<00:03:50.750> leaking<00:03:51.200> mitral<00:03:51.620> valves<00:03:52.209> very<00:03:53.209> uncommon

00:03:53.650 --> 00:03:53.660 
many leaking mitral valves very uncommon

00:03:53.660 --> 00:03:57.880 
many leaking mitral valves very uncommon
we<00:03:54.190> always<00:03:55.190> try<00:03:55.459> to<00:03:55.489> repair<00:03:55.910> them<00:03:56.180> and<00:03:56.709> most<00:03:57.709> of

00:03:57.880 --> 00:03:57.890 
we always try to repair them and most of

00:03:57.890 --> 00:04:00.790 
we always try to repair them and most of
the<00:03:57.980> time<00:03:58.190> I'd<00:03:58.550> say<00:03:58.760> 90%<00:03:59.150> are<00:03:59.600> better<00:03:59.810> we<00:04:00.110> we<00:04:00.590> do

00:04:00.790 --> 00:04:00.800 
the time I'd say 90% are better we we do

00:04:00.800 --> 00:04:03.070 
the time I'd say 90% are better we we do
repair<00:04:01.700> them<00:04:02.000> rather<00:04:02.180> than<00:04:02.390> replace<00:04:02.720> them<00:04:02.959> and

00:04:03.070 --> 00:04:03.080 
repair them rather than replace them and

00:04:03.080 --> 00:04:06.870 
repair them rather than replace them and
the<00:04:03.140> benefit<00:04:03.590> is<00:04:03.620> that<00:04:04.570> the<00:04:05.570> patient<00:04:06.080> is<00:04:06.290> left

00:04:06.870 --> 00:04:06.880 
the benefit is that the patient is left

00:04:06.880 --> 00:04:09.820 
the benefit is that the patient is left
retrograde<00:04:07.880> the<00:04:08.000> patient's<00:04:08.420> left<00:04:08.630> with<00:04:08.870> with

00:04:09.820 --> 00:04:09.830 
retrograde the patient's left with with

00:04:09.830 --> 00:04:12.460 
retrograde the patient's left with with
their<00:04:10.070> own<00:04:10.220> valve<00:04:11.209> tissue<00:04:11.600> that<00:04:12.019> they<00:04:12.200> were

00:04:12.460 --> 00:04:12.470 
their own valve tissue that they were

00:04:12.470 --> 00:04:18.430 
their own valve tissue that they were
born<00:04:12.709> with<00:04:15.760> and<00:04:16.760> they<00:04:17.180> avoid<00:04:17.540> long-term

00:04:18.430 --> 00:04:18.440 
born with and they avoid long-term

00:04:18.440 --> 00:04:20.530 
born with and they avoid long-term
anticoagulation<00:04:19.390> potentially<00:04:20.390> with

00:04:20.530 --> 00:04:20.540 
anticoagulation potentially with

00:04:20.540 --> 00:04:22.540 
anticoagulation potentially with
coumadin<00:04:21.019> and<00:04:21.530> they<00:04:21.709> enjoy<00:04:21.980> a<00:04:22.010> survival

00:04:22.540 --> 00:04:22.550 
coumadin and they enjoy a survival

00:04:22.550 --> 00:04:25.230 
coumadin and they enjoy a survival
advantage<00:04:22.640> we<00:04:23.360> always<00:04:23.720> use<00:04:23.960> transesophageal

00:04:25.230 --> 00:04:25.240 
advantage we always use transesophageal

00:04:25.240 --> 00:04:28.360 
advantage we always use transesophageal
echocardiography<00:04:26.240> to<00:04:26.840> image<00:04:27.620> the<00:04:27.800> heart<00:04:27.980> and

of cases the benefit of of
transesophageal<00:04:34.480> echocardiography<00:04:35.480> is<00:04:36.050> that

00:04:36.310 --> 00:04:36.320 
transesophageal echocardiography is that

00:04:36.320 --> 00:04:37.930 
transesophageal echocardiography is that
we<00:04:36.680> get<00:04:36.830> a<00:04:36.890> really<00:04:37.130> nice<00:04:37.370> picture<00:04:37.790> of<00:04:37.820> the

00:04:37.930 --> 00:04:37.940 
we get a really nice picture of the

00:04:37.940 --> 00:04:40.150 
we get a really nice picture of the
mitral<00:04:38.300> valve<00:04:38.540> that<00:04:39.110> allows<00:04:39.169> us<00:04:39.560> to<00:04:39.740> see<00:04:40.130> the

00:04:40.150 --> 00:04:40.160 
mitral valve that allows us to see the

00:04:40.160 --> 00:04:43.330 
mitral valve that allows us to see the
the<00:04:40.669> valve<00:04:41.530> functioning<00:04:42.530> you<00:04:42.650> know<00:04:42.830> as<00:04:42.980> it<00:04:43.160> is

00:04:43.330 --> 00:04:43.340 
the valve functioning you know as it is

00:04:43.340 --> 00:04:45.190 
the valve functioning you know as it is
in<00:04:43.610> the<00:04:43.700> heart<00:04:43.940> with<00:04:44.180> a<00:04:44.210> beating<00:04:44.630> and<00:04:44.840> full<00:04:45.080> of

00:04:45.190 --> 00:04:45.200 
in the heart with a beating and full of

00:04:45.200 --> 00:04:46.300 
in the heart with a beating and full of
blood<00:04:45.440> and<00:04:45.470> so<00:04:45.860> on

00:04:46.300 --> 00:04:46.310 
blood and so on

00:04:46.310 --> 00:04:48.760 
blood and so on
and<00:04:46.580> that<00:04:46.850> helps<00:04:47.240> me<00:04:47.540> to<00:04:47.930> do<00:04:48.110> a<00:04:48.140> little<00:04:48.440> bit<00:04:48.620> of

00:04:48.760 --> 00:04:48.770 
and that helps me to do a little bit of

00:04:48.770 --> 00:04:50.840 
and that helps me to do a little bit of
planning<00:04:49.130> as<00:04:49.640> to<00:04:50.000> technique

00:04:50.840 --> 00:04:50.850 
planning as to technique

00:04:50.850 --> 00:04:52.430 
planning as to technique
and<00:04:51.240> what<00:04:51.390> technique<00:04:51.750> I'm<00:04:51.870> going<00:04:51.900> to<00:04:52.110> use<00:04:52.260> to

00:04:52.430 --> 00:04:52.440 
and what technique I'm going to use to

00:04:52.440 --> 00:04:54.860 
and what technique I'm going to use to
repair<00:04:52.800> the<00:04:52.920> valve<00:04:53.130> so<00:04:53.760> the<00:04:53.790> T<00:04:54.150> helps<00:04:54.630> us<00:04:54.720> with

00:04:54.860 --> 00:04:54.870 
repair the valve so the T helps us with

00:04:54.870 --> 00:04:58.370 
repair the valve so the T helps us with
that<00:04:55.080> well<00:04:55.350> the<00:04:55.770> 3d<00:04:56.310> imaging<00:04:57.270> is<00:04:57.810> just<00:04:58.080> a<00:04:58.200> whole

00:04:58.370 --> 00:04:58.380 
that well the 3d imaging is just a whole

00:04:58.380 --> 00:05:03.020 
that well the 3d imaging is just a whole
nother<00:04:58.650> leap<00:04:59.520> forward<00:05:00.120> in<00:05:00.810> technology<00:05:01.110> it<00:05:02.030> it

00:05:03.020 --> 00:05:03.030 
nother leap forward in technology it it

00:05:03.030 --> 00:05:06.560 
nother leap forward in technology it it
acquires<00:05:03.860> 3d<00:05:04.860> images<00:05:05.460> of<00:05:05.490> the<00:05:05.790> valve<00:05:06.030> so<00:05:06.390> we're

00:05:06.560 --> 00:05:06.570 
acquires 3d images of the valve so we're

00:05:06.570 --> 00:05:08.150 
acquires 3d images of the valve so we're
not<00:05:06.690> looking<00:05:07.050> at<00:05:07.140> a<00:05:07.260> two-dimensional<00:05:08.070> image

00:05:08.150 --> 00:05:08.160 
not looking at a two-dimensional image

00:05:08.160 --> 00:05:11.150 
not looking at a two-dimensional image
anymore<00:05:08.760> the<00:05:09.450> cardiologists<00:05:10.080> actually<00:05:10.470> is

00:05:11.150 --> 00:05:11.160 
anymore the cardiologists actually is

00:05:11.160 --> 00:05:14.900 
anymore the cardiologists actually is
able<00:05:11.340> to<00:05:11.520> to<00:05:12.180> image<00:05:12.540> the<00:05:12.810> valve<00:05:13.110> and<00:05:13.890> look<00:05:14.700> at

00:05:14.900 --> 00:05:14.910 
able to to image the valve and look at

00:05:14.910 --> 00:05:17.510 
able to to image the valve and look at
it<00:05:15.120> in<00:05:15.330> in<00:05:15.990> a<00:05:16.080> way<00:05:16.110> that's<00:05:16.590> very<00:05:16.680> similar<00:05:17.400> to

00:05:17.510 --> 00:05:17.520 
it in in a way that's very similar to

00:05:17.520 --> 00:05:18.860 
it in in a way that's very similar to
the<00:05:17.610> way<00:05:17.730> I'm<00:05:18.000> going<00:05:18.210> to<00:05:18.270> be<00:05:18.330> looking<00:05:18.600> at<00:05:18.750> with

00:05:18.860 --> 00:05:18.870 
the way I'm going to be looking at with

00:05:18.870 --> 00:05:19.760 
the way I'm going to be looking at with
my<00:05:19.080> own<00:05:19.200> eyes

00:05:19.760 --> 00:05:19.770 
my own eyes

00:05:19.770 --> 00:05:21.320 
my own eyes
it<00:05:20.190> just<00:05:20.430> really<00:05:20.730> adds<00:05:20.970> a<00:05:21.120> whole<00:05:21.270> other

00:05:21.320 --> 00:05:21.330 
it just really adds a whole other

00:05:21.330 --> 00:05:24.110 
it just really adds a whole other
dimension<00:05:22.080> to<00:05:22.200> accurately<00:05:23.130> assessing<00:05:23.880> the

00:05:24.110 --> 00:05:24.120 
dimension to accurately assessing the

00:05:24.120 --> 00:05:26.090 
dimension to accurately assessing the
valve<00:05:24.360> and<00:05:24.630> the<00:05:24.720> pathology<00:05:25.380> of<00:05:25.440> the<00:05:25.530> valve<00:05:25.740> and

valve and the pathology of the valve and
the<00:05:26.220> dysfunction<00:05:26.820> of<00:05:26.880> the<00:05:27.000> valve<00:05:27.210> and<00:05:27.570> then

00:05:27.800 --> 00:05:27.810 
the dysfunction of the valve and then

00:05:27.810 --> 00:05:29.570 
the dysfunction of the valve and then
just<00:05:28.050> as<00:05:28.140> importantly<00:05:28.650> we'll<00:05:29.130> use<00:05:29.400> that

00:05:29.570 --> 00:05:29.580 
just as importantly we'll use that

00:05:29.580 --> 00:05:31.970 
just as importantly we'll use that
imaging<00:05:30.060> after<00:05:30.690> we<00:05:30.840> do<00:05:30.990> the<00:05:31.110> operation<00:05:31.410> after

00:05:31.970 --> 00:05:31.980 
imaging after we do the operation after

00:05:31.980 --> 00:05:33.560 
imaging after we do the operation after
we<00:05:32.070> do<00:05:32.190> to<00:05:32.310> prepare<00:05:32.460> while<00:05:33.240> we're<00:05:33.420> in<00:05:33.510> the

00:05:33.560 --> 00:05:33.570 
we do to prepare while we're in the

00:05:33.570 --> 00:05:35.570 
we do to prepare while we're in the
operating<00:05:33.960> room<00:05:34.170> -<00:05:34.470> to<00:05:34.920> see<00:05:35.160> what<00:05:35.370> we've<00:05:35.550> done

00:05:35.570 --> 00:05:35.580 
operating room - to see what we've done

00:05:35.580 --> 00:05:37.040 
operating room - to see what we've done
because<00:05:36.060> when<00:05:36.210> I'm<00:05:36.330> looking<00:05:36.360> at<00:05:36.690> the<00:05:36.810> valve

00:05:37.040 --> 00:05:37.050 
because when I'm looking at the valve

00:05:37.050 --> 00:05:40.040 
because when I'm looking at the valve
the<00:05:37.950> heart<00:05:38.190> has<00:05:38.370> stopped<00:05:38.760> it's<00:05:39.360> empty<00:05:39.750> and<00:05:39.960> the

00:05:40.040 --> 00:05:40.050 
the heart has stopped it's empty and the

00:05:40.050 --> 00:05:41.780 
the heart has stopped it's empty and the
valve<00:05:40.230> is<00:05:40.380> just<00:05:40.590> sitting<00:05:40.950> there<00:05:40.980> so<00:05:41.580> there's

00:05:41.780 --> 00:05:41.790 
valve is just sitting there so there's

00:05:41.790 --> 00:05:44.330 
valve is just sitting there so there's
some<00:05:42.030> art<00:05:42.270> to<00:05:42.540> repairing<00:05:43.230> the<00:05:43.350> valve<00:05:43.560> and<00:05:43.860> sort

00:05:44.330 --> 00:05:44.340 
some art to repairing the valve and sort

00:05:44.340 --> 00:05:46.220 
some art to repairing the valve and sort
of<00:05:44.400> knowing<00:05:44.760> in<00:05:44.910> your<00:05:44.940> mind<00:05:45.270> how<00:05:45.780> that<00:05:45.990> valve

00:05:46.220 --> 00:05:46.230 
of knowing in your mind how that valve

00:05:46.230 --> 00:05:47.780 
of knowing in your mind how that valve
is<00:05:46.380> going<00:05:46.440> to<00:05:46.650> look<00:05:46.830> and<00:05:47.040> function<00:05:47.460> when<00:05:47.670> the

00:05:47.780 --> 00:05:47.790 
is going to look and function when the

00:05:47.790 --> 00:05:49.730 
is going to look and function when the
heart's<00:05:48.060> full<00:05:48.540> and<00:05:48.840> beating<00:05:49.110> again<00:05:49.320> well<00:05:49.500> now

00:05:49.740 --> 00:05:51.770 
heart's full and beating again well now
we<00:05:50.100> get<00:05:50.340> to<00:05:50.520> see<00:05:50.700> what<00:05:50.880> it<00:05:50.970> looks<00:05:51.690> like

00:05:51.770 --> 00:05:51.780 
we get to see what it looks like

00:05:51.780 --> 00:05:54.290 
we get to see what it looks like
literally<00:05:52.260> with<00:05:52.620> this<00:05:52.830> three<00:05:53.100> 3d<00:05:53.730> echo<00:05:54.060> and<00:05:54.240> we
