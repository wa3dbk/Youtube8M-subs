now<00:03:56.040> you<00:03:56.100> need<00:03:56.280> to<00:03:56.460> test<00:03:56.670> a<00:03:56.790> couple<00:03:56.940> by

00:03:57.520 --> 00:03:57.530 
now you need to test a couple by

00:03:57.530 --> 00:03:59.650 
now you need to test a couple by
tuning<00:03:57.740> at<00:03:57.830> three<00:03:58.069> boulders<00:03:58.450> first<00:03:59.450> thing
