00:00:53.600 --> 00:00:53.610 
up if it runs then that pretty well

00:00:53.610 --> 00:00:55.520 
up if it runs then that pretty well
confirmed<00:00:53.789> tip<00:00:54.210> but<00:00:54.629> it<00:00:54.719> also<00:00:54.870> helps<00:00:55.260> you<00:00:55.350> get

00:01:44.420 --> 00:01:44.430 
now and this will go to our fittings

00:01:44.430 --> 00:01:46.039 
now and this will go to our fittings
that<00:01:44.490> we've<00:01:44.759> made<00:01:45.000> we've<00:01:45.360> set<00:01:45.600> them<00:01:45.689> up<00:01:45.840> for<00:01:46.020> a

00:01:46.039 --> 00:01:46.049 
that we've made we've set them up for a

00:01:46.049 --> 00:01:48.969 
that we've made we've set them up for a
quick<00:01:46.290> connect<00:01:46.530> so<00:01:46.740> it'll<00:01:46.950> go<00:01:47.040> right<00:01:47.220> there

00:01:48.969 --> 00:01:48.979 
quick connect so it'll go right there

00:01:48.979 --> 00:01:54.100 
quick connect so it'll go right there
this<00:01:49.979> one<00:01:50.220> will<00:01:50.340> go<00:01:50.460> right<00:01:50.700> here

00:01:54.100 --> 00:01:54.110 

00:01:54.110 --> 00:01:56.170 

that<00:01:54.860> one<00:01:55.040> will<00:01:55.190> go<00:01:55.310> to<00:01:55.340> the<00:01:55.580> Schrader<00:01:55.850> valve

00:01:56.170 --> 00:01:56.180 
that one will go to the Schrader valve

00:01:56.180 --> 00:01:58.720 
that one will go to the Schrader valve
on<00:01:56.420> the<00:01:56.540> vehicle<00:01:56.990> and<00:01:57.980> we've<00:01:58.250> also<00:01:58.430> got<00:01:58.670> a

00:01:58.720 --> 00:01:58.730 
on the vehicle and we've also got a

00:01:58.730 --> 00:02:01.240 
on the vehicle and we've also got a
valve<00:01:59.060> in<00:01:59.390> here<00:01:59.810> so<00:02:00.020> that<00:02:00.050> you<00:02:00.140> can<00:02:00.350> turn<00:02:00.560> open

00:02:01.240 --> 00:02:01.250 
valve in here so that you can turn open

00:02:01.250 --> 00:02:02.970 
valve in here so that you can turn open
your<00:02:01.370> fuel<00:02:01.640> up<00:02:01.820> allow<00:02:02.150> it<00:02:02.210> to<00:02:02.360> flow<00:02:02.570> or<00:02:02.750> not

00:02:02.970 --> 00:02:02.980 
your fuel up allow it to flow or not

00:02:02.980 --> 00:02:06.640 
your fuel up allow it to flow or not
then<00:02:03.980> it<00:02:04.100> goes<00:02:04.250> over<00:02:04.370> to<00:02:04.580> here<00:02:05.590> this<00:02:06.590> will

00:02:06.640 --> 00:02:06.650 
then it goes over to here this will

00:02:06.650 --> 00:02:09.910 
then it goes over to here this will
become<00:02:07.010> your<00:02:07.190> fuel<00:02:07.730> tank<00:02:08.289> you<00:02:09.289> simply<00:02:09.710> take

00:02:09.910 --> 00:02:09.920 
become your fuel tank you simply take

00:02:09.920 --> 00:02:11.560 
become your fuel tank you simply take
this<00:02:10.100> off<00:02:10.310> and<00:02:10.340> pour<00:02:10.820> just<00:02:11.060> a<00:02:11.150> couple<00:02:11.360> inches

of<00:02:11.750> gasoline<00:02:12.290> in<00:02:12.470> there<00:02:12.650> and<00:02:13.510> this<00:02:14.510> is<00:02:14.720> your

00:02:14.890 --> 00:02:14.900 
of gasoline in there and this is your

00:02:14.900 --> 00:02:22.150 
of gasoline in there and this is your
fuel<00:02:15.140> pump<00:02:15.730> you<00:02:16.730> hook<00:02:16.880> that<00:02:17.060> on<00:02:17.210> there<00:02:21.010> fill<00:02:22.010> it

00:02:22.150 --> 00:02:22.160 
fuel pump you hook that on there fill it

00:02:22.160 --> 00:02:24.940 
fuel pump you hook that on there fill it
up<00:02:22.280> with<00:02:22.459> your<00:02:22.520> with<00:02:23.240> pressure<00:02:23.620> so<00:02:24.620> now<00:02:24.770> you've

00:02:24.940 --> 00:02:24.950 
up with your with pressure so now you've

00:02:24.950 --> 00:02:27.220 
up with your with pressure so now you've
got<00:02:24.980> a<00:02:25.100> fuel<00:02:25.459> tank<00:02:25.930> providing<00:02:26.930> pressure

00:02:27.220 --> 00:02:27.230 
got a fuel tank providing pressure

00:02:27.230 --> 00:02:29.530 
got a fuel tank providing pressure
that's<00:02:27.980> going<00:02:28.130> to<00:02:28.250> go<00:02:28.400> through<00:02:28.700> here<00:02:28.970> you'll

00:02:29.530 --> 00:02:29.540 
that's going to go through here you'll

00:02:29.540 --> 00:02:31.930 
that's going to go through here you'll
be<00:02:29.720> able<00:02:29.870> to<00:02:30.140> read<00:02:30.440> the<00:02:30.650> gauge<00:02:30.890> see<00:02:31.670> what<00:02:31.820> your

00:02:31.930 --> 00:02:31.940 
be able to read the gauge see what your

00:02:31.940 --> 00:02:35.800 
be able to read the gauge see what your
pressure<00:02:32.180> is<00:02:32.620> you<00:02:33.620> can<00:02:33.800> control<00:02:34.040> the<00:02:34.400> flow<00:02:34.810> and

00:02:35.800 --> 00:02:35.810 
pressure is you can control the flow and

00:02:35.810 --> 00:02:36.910 
pressure is you can control the flow and
you're<00:02:35.959> going<00:02:36.080> to<00:02:36.110> go<00:02:36.230> right<00:02:36.410> to<00:02:36.590> the<00:02:36.680> fuel

00:02:36.910 --> 00:02:36.920 
you're going to go right to the fuel

00:02:36.920 --> 00:02:37.979 
you're going to go right to the fuel
port

00:02:37.979 --> 00:02:37.989 
port

00:02:37.989 --> 00:02:40.479 
port
so<00:02:38.989> now<00:02:39.170> we'll<00:02:39.380> hook<00:02:39.530> it<00:02:39.590> hook<00:02:39.709> it<00:02:40.010> all<00:02:40.070> up<00:02:40.130> and

00:02:40.479 --> 00:02:40.489 
so now we'll hook it hook it all up and

00:02:40.489 --> 00:02:41.440 
so now we'll hook it hook it all up and
show<00:02:40.700> you<00:02:40.760> how<00:02:40.880> it<00:02:41.000> works

00:02:41.440 --> 00:02:41.450 
show you how it works

00:02:41.450 --> 00:02:43.479 
show you how it works
there's<00:02:41.930> our<00:02:42.140> Schrader<00:02:42.470> port<00:02:42.860> and<00:02:43.070> our<00:02:43.250> first

00:02:43.479 --> 00:02:43.489 
there's our Schrader port and our first

00:02:43.489 --> 00:02:45.370 
there's our Schrader port and our first
line<00:02:43.760> is<00:02:44.000> going<00:02:44.060> right<00:02:44.390> there<00:02:44.660> we'll<00:02:45.050> hook<00:02:45.170> our

00:02:45.370 --> 00:02:45.380 
line is going right there we'll hook our

00:02:45.380 --> 00:02:58.210 
line is going right there we'll hook our
device<00:02:45.650> up<00:02:45.890> to<00:02:45.920> it

00:02:58.210 --> 00:02:58.220 

00:02:58.220 --> 00:03:01.280 

now<00:02:59.220> we<00:02:59.280> need<00:02:59.519> to<00:02:59.670> add<00:02:59.760> a<00:02:59.790> little<00:02:59.940> pressure<00:03:00.290> we

00:03:01.280 --> 00:03:01.290 
now we need to add a little pressure we

00:03:01.290 --> 00:03:04.460 
now we need to add a little pressure we
just<00:03:01.530> use<00:03:01.739> the<00:03:01.950> regular<00:03:02.129> type<00:03:02.610> of<00:03:03.200> tire<00:03:04.200> deal

00:03:04.460 --> 00:03:04.470 
just use the regular type of tire deal

00:03:04.470 --> 00:03:05.920 
just use the regular type of tire deal
that's<00:03:04.680> got<00:03:04.799> a<00:03:04.830> gauge<00:03:05.069> in<00:03:05.099> it

00:03:05.920 --> 00:03:05.930 
that's got a gauge in it

00:03:05.930 --> 00:03:09.649 
that's got a gauge in it
our<00:03:06.930> fuel<00:03:07.230> pressure<00:03:07.470> specs<00:03:07.860> about<00:03:08.129> 60<00:03:08.640> now<00:03:09.599> we

00:03:09.649 --> 00:03:09.659 
our fuel pressure specs about 60 now we

00:03:09.659 --> 00:03:15.710 
our fuel pressure specs about 60 now we
come<00:03:09.900> down<00:03:09.930> here<00:03:10.290> and<00:03:10.379> open<00:03:10.440> our<00:03:10.739> valve<00:03:14.720> and

00:03:15.710 --> 00:03:15.720 
come down here and open our valve and

00:03:15.720 --> 00:03:19.130 
come down here and open our valve and
then<00:03:16.530> we'll<00:03:17.450> look<00:03:18.450> at<00:03:18.569> the<00:03:18.660> pressure<00:03:18.870> gauge

00:03:19.130 --> 00:03:19.140 
then we'll look at the pressure gauge

00:03:19.140 --> 00:03:27.800 
then we'll look at the pressure gauge
and<00:03:19.170> we've<00:03:19.590> got<00:03:19.799> about<00:03:21.590> 40<00:03:22.590> psi<00:03:22.769> showing<00:03:26.810> now

00:03:27.800 --> 00:03:27.810 
and we've got about 40 psi showing now

00:03:27.810 --> 00:03:37.910 
and we've got about 40 psi showing now
we<00:03:27.900> crank<00:03:28.260> it

00:03:37.910 --> 00:03:37.920 

00:03:37.920 --> 00:03:41.990 

you<00:03:38.400> have<00:03:38.490> to<00:03:38.580> fill<00:03:38.760> that<00:03:38.910> fuel<00:03:39.240> line<00:03:39.300> up<00:03:39.660> first
