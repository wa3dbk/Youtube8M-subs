lead<00:02:16.590> it's<00:02:16.829> basically<00:02:17.069> since<00:02:17.340> we're<00:02:17.489> playing

00:02:17.509 --> 00:02:17.519 
lead it's basically since we're playing

00:02:17.519 --> 00:02:19.339 
lead it's basically since we're playing
the<00:02:17.790> stillers<00:02:18.239> an<00:02:18.420> distilleries<00:02:19.139> you<00:02:19.230> know

timing<00:02:26.760> problems<00:02:27.120> between<00:02:27.299> LeBron<00:02:27.840> James<00:02:28.200> and

00:02:28.429 --> 00:02:28.439 
timing problems between LeBron James and

00:02:28.439 --> 00:02:30.349 
timing problems between LeBron James and
Johnny<00:02:28.920> football<00:02:29.459> because<00:02:29.969> on<00:02:30.120> this<00:02:30.209> play

00:02:30.349 --> 00:02:30.359 
Johnny football because on this play

00:02:30.359 --> 00:02:31.759 
Johnny football because on this play
right<00:02:30.389> here<00:02:30.569> I<00:02:30.750> was<00:02:30.959> calling<00:02:31.230> for<00:02:31.349> when<00:02:31.560> I<00:02:31.590> was

00:02:31.759 --> 00:02:31.769 
right here I was calling for when I was

00:02:31.769 --> 00:02:33.349 
right here I was calling for when I was
over<00:02:32.010> the<00:02:32.099> middle<00:02:32.370> of<00:02:32.459> the<00:02:32.549> field<00:02:32.700> but<00:02:33.180> he

00:02:33.349 --> 00:02:33.359 
over the middle of the field but he

00:02:33.359 --> 00:02:34.910 
over the middle of the field but he
waited<00:02:33.480> till<00:02:33.689> I<00:02:33.780> was<00:02:33.870> by<00:02:34.079> the<00:02:34.109> sideline<00:02:34.650> I

00:02:34.910 --> 00:02:34.920 
waited till I was by the sideline I

00:02:34.920 --> 00:02:36.530 
waited till I was by the sideline I
should<00:02:35.340> just<00:02:35.549> let<00:02:35.700> that<00:02:35.819> pass<00:02:36.060> sell<00:02:36.329> out<00:02:36.450> the

00:02:36.530 --> 00:02:36.540 
should just let that pass sell out the

00:02:36.540 --> 00:02:38.420 
should just let that pass sell out the
bounce<00:02:36.719> but<00:02:37.049> I<00:02:37.079> wanted<00:02:37.409> to<00:02:37.560> catch<00:02:37.739> you<00:02:37.769> but

00:02:38.420 --> 00:02:38.430 
bounce but I wanted to catch you but

00:02:38.430 --> 00:02:39.770 
bounce but I wanted to catch you but
either<00:02:38.609> way<00:02:38.849> we<00:02:39.090> were<00:02:39.209> going<00:02:39.359> to<00:02:39.450> end<00:02:39.629> up

00:02:39.770 --> 00:02:39.780 
either way we were going to end up

00:02:39.780 --> 00:02:41.690 
either way we were going to end up
losing<00:02:40.200> yards<00:02:40.620> like<00:02:40.859> I<00:02:40.950> said<00:02:41.010> before<00:02:41.250> it<00:02:41.549> was

00:02:41.690 --> 00:02:41.700 
losing yards like I said before it was

00:02:41.700 --> 00:02:43.220 
losing yards like I said before it was
just<00:02:41.939> the<00:02:42.030> timing<00:02:42.299> man<00:02:42.629> that<00:02:43.049> play<00:02:43.200> was

00:02:43.220 --> 00:02:43.230 
just the timing man that play was

00:02:43.230 --> 00:02:44.690 
just the timing man that play was
crucial<00:02:43.709> because<00:02:43.739> if<00:02:44.159> we<00:02:44.280> turned<00:02:44.489> the<00:02:44.579> ball

00:02:44.690 --> 00:02:44.700 
crucial because if we turned the ball

00:02:44.700 --> 00:02:46.580 
crucial because if we turned the ball
over<00:02:44.760> to<00:02:45.120> the<00:02:45.150> Steelers<00:02:45.599> we<00:02:46.230> know<00:02:46.439> they're
