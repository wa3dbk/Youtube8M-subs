00:02:51.470 --> 00:02:51.480 
can find the answer by counting the

00:02:51.480 --> 00:03:02.839 
can find the answer by counting the
number<00:02:51.720> of<00:02:52.140> jumps<00:02:53.030> 1<00:02:54.079> 2<00:02:55.079> 3<00:02:55.730> 4<00:02:57.590> 5<00:02:58.590> 6<00:03:00.890> so<00:03:01.890> 12

00:03:02.839 --> 00:03:02.849 
number of jumps 1 2 3 4 5 6 so 12

00:03:02.849 --> 00:03:08.240 
number of jumps 1 2 3 4 5 6 so 12
divided<00:03:03.480> by<00:03:04.019> 2<00:03:04.410> is<00:03:04.859> equal<00:03:05.760> to<00:03:06.030> six<00:03:06.829> this<00:03:07.829> means

00:03:08.240 --> 00:03:08.250 
divided by 2 is equal to six this means

00:03:08.250 --> 00:03:12.680 
divided by 2 is equal to six this means
that<00:03:08.670> i<00:03:09.150> will<00:03:09.450> need<00:03:09.959> six<00:03:10.859> jumps<00:03:11.519> to<00:03:12.000> cross<00:03:12.329> the

00:03:12.680 --> 00:03:12.690 
that i will need six jumps to cross the

00:03:12.690 --> 00:03:17.770 
that i will need six jumps to cross the
bridge<00:03:13.910> so<00:03:14.910> you<00:03:14.970> see<00:03:15.390> amber<00:03:15.900> I<00:03:16.170> was<00:03:16.890> correct<00:03:17.129> I

cross the bridge you mean we will have

00:04:57.370 --> 00:05:02.880 
cross the bridge you mean we will have
to<00:04:57.430> jump<00:04:58.030> from<00:04:58.620> 0<00:04:59.620> to<00:05:00.190> 30<00:05:00.600> by<00:05:01.600> jumping<00:05:02.230> ten

00:05:02.880 --> 00:05:02.890 
to jump from 0 to 30 by jumping ten

00:05:02.890 --> 00:05:07.170 
to jump from 0 to 30 by jumping ten
numbers<00:05:03.520> at<00:05:03.700> a<00:05:03.730> time<00:05:04.560> that's<00:05:05.560> right<00:05:06.030> here<00:05:07.030> we

00:05:07.170 --> 00:05:07.180 
numbers at a time that's right here we

00:05:07.180 --> 00:05:16.470 
numbers at a time that's right here we
go<00:05:07.740> one<00:05:08.740> two<00:05:10.169> three<00:05:11.610> so<00:05:12.610> 30<00:05:13.570> /<00:05:14.410> 10<00:05:14.950> is<00:05:15.370> equal<00:05:15.940> to

00:05:16.470 --> 00:05:16.480 
go one two three so 30 / 10 is equal to

00:05:16.480 --> 00:05:21.030 
go one two three so 30 / 10 is equal to
free<00:05:16.980> let<00:05:17.980> us<00:05:18.190> take<00:05:18.460> another<00:05:18.700> example<00:05:19.210> now<00:05:20.040> we

00:05:21.030 --> 00:05:21.040 
free let us take another example now we

00:05:21.040 --> 00:05:26.280 
free let us take another example now we
will<00:05:21.280> divide<00:05:21.760> the<00:05:22.090> number<00:05:22.330> of<00:05:22.750> 28<00:05:23.590> by<00:05:24.340> seven<00:05:25.290> we

00:05:26.280 --> 00:05:26.290 
will divide the number of 28 by seven we

00:05:26.290 --> 00:05:31.380 
will divide the number of 28 by seven we
will<00:05:26.590> have<00:05:26.860> to<00:05:26.919> jump<00:05:27.520> from<00:05:28.120> 0<00:05:28.750> to<00:05:29.530> 28<00:05:30.400> by

00:05:31.380 --> 00:05:31.390 
will have to jump from 0 to 28 by

00:05:31.390 --> 00:05:40.950 
will have to jump from 0 to 28 by
jumping<00:05:32.050> seven<00:05:32.919> numbers<00:05:33.370> at<00:05:33.610> a<00:05:33.640> time<00:05:37.800> 1230

00:05:40.950 --> 00:05:40.960 

00:05:40.960 --> 00:05:49.230 

so<00:05:41.910> 28<00:05:43.020> /<00:05:44.020> 7<00:05:44.860> is<00:05:45.069> equal<00:05:45.180> to<00:05:46.180> four<00:05:46.690> very<00:05:48.240> good

00:05:49.230 --> 00:05:49.240 
so 28 / 7 is equal to four very good

00:05:49.240 --> 00:05:53.730 
so 28 / 7 is equal to four very good
