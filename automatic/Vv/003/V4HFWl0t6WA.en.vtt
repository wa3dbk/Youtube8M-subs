00:01:14.810 --> 00:01:17.510 

okay<00:01:15.840> another<00:01:16.170> way<00:01:16.350> to<00:01:16.380> separate<00:01:16.920> an<00:01:17.100> egg<00:01:17.280> is

00:01:17.510 --> 00:01:17.520 
okay another way to separate an egg is

00:01:17.520 --> 00:01:22.969 
okay another way to separate an egg is
to<00:01:18.360> crack<00:01:18.659> the<00:01:18.900> egg<00:01:19.080> into<00:01:19.409> your<00:01:19.920> hand<00:01:21.979> just

00:01:36.150 --> 00:01:38.719 
fingers and then discard the yolk okay
we'll<00:01:36.450> need<00:01:36.479> to<00:01:36.869> do<00:01:37.079> several<00:01:37.710> of<00:01:37.920> these<00:01:38.130> I'll

00:01:38.719 --> 00:01:38.729 
we'll need to do several of these I'll

00:01:38.729 --> 00:01:41.630 
we'll need to do several of these I'll
show<00:01:39.000> you<00:01:39.060> how<00:01:39.360> to<00:01:39.439> its<00:01:40.439> if<00:01:40.920> you're<00:01:41.130> doing<00:01:41.460> it

00:01:41.640 --> 00:01:44.870 
show you how to its if you're doing it
this<00:01:42.210> way<00:01:42.270> through<00:01:42.810> your<00:01:42.990> hands<00:01:43.649> it's<00:01:44.369> easier

00:01:44.870 --> 00:01:44.880 
this way through your hands it's easier

00:01:44.880 --> 00:01:47.780 
this way through your hands it's easier
if<00:01:45.210> you<00:01:45.600> can<00:01:46.200> crack<00:01:46.530> the<00:01:46.710> egg<00:01:46.860> with<00:01:47.070> one<00:01:47.280> hand

00:01:47.780 --> 00:01:47.790 
if you can crack the egg with one hand

00:01:47.790 --> 00:01:52.999 
if you can crack the egg with one hand
and<00:01:48.180> I'll<00:01:49.110> show<00:01:49.500> you<00:01:49.560> how<00:01:49.890> to<00:01:49.920> do<00:01:50.189> that<00:01:50.899> if<00:01:52.009> you

00:01:52.999 --> 00:01:53.009 
and I'll show you how to do that if you

00:01:53.009 --> 00:01:57.080 
and I'll show you how to do that if you
grasp<00:01:53.549> the<00:01:53.909> egg<00:01:54.229> like<00:01:55.229> this<00:01:55.680> so<00:01:56.640> that<00:01:56.670> these

00:01:57.080 --> 00:01:57.090 
grasp the egg like this so that these

00:01:57.090 --> 00:01:59.240 
grasp the egg like this so that these
two<00:01:57.450> fingers<00:01:57.750> are<00:01:58.290> going<00:01:58.500> to<00:01:58.560> pull<00:01:58.799> the<00:01:58.950> shell

00:01:59.240 --> 00:01:59.250 
two fingers are going to pull the shell

00:01:59.250 --> 00:02:01.730 
two fingers are going to pull the shell
that<00:01:59.549> way<00:01:59.820> and<00:02:00.149> these<00:02:00.689> two<00:02:00.990> fingers<00:02:01.259> are<00:02:01.619> going

00:02:01.730 --> 00:02:01.740 
that way and these two fingers are going

00:02:01.740 --> 00:02:04.969 
that way and these two fingers are going
to<00:02:01.829> pull<00:02:02.040> the<00:02:02.070> shell<00:02:02.460> that<00:02:02.700> way<00:02:03.049> then<00:02:04.049> crack

00:02:04.969 --> 00:02:04.979 
to pull the shell that way then crack

00:02:04.979 --> 00:02:10.249 
to pull the shell that way then crack
the<00:02:05.219> egg<00:02:05.399> and<00:02:06.229> just<00:02:08.330> drop<00:02:09.330> it<00:02:09.539> usually<00:02:09.959> drop<00:02:10.140> it

00:02:10.249 --> 00:02:10.259 
the egg and just drop it usually drop it

00:02:10.259 --> 00:02:11.809 
the egg and just drop it usually drop it
into<00:02:10.440> your<00:02:10.590> hands<00:02:11.069> but<00:02:11.190> I<00:02:11.250> dropped<00:02:11.550> it<00:02:11.670> into

00:02:11.809 --> 00:02:11.819 
into your hands but I dropped it into

00:02:11.819 --> 00:02:14.059 
into your hands but I dropped it into
