00:02:14.590 --> 00:02:14.600 
isn't capable of it I've asked her to

00:02:14.600 --> 00:02:15.970 
isn't capable of it I've asked her to
stay<00:02:14.750> with<00:02:14.870> us<00:02:15.019> until<00:02:15.170> she's<00:02:15.500> ready<00:02:15.709> to<00:02:15.890> go

00:02:15.970 --> 00:02:15.980 
stay with us until she's ready to go

00:02:15.980 --> 00:02:17.110 
stay with us until she's ready to go
back<00:02:16.100> home<00:02:16.160> and<00:02:16.519> I<00:02:16.670> wouldn't<00:02:16.880> have<00:02:16.910> done<00:02:17.030> that

00:02:17.110 --> 00:02:17.120 
back home and I wouldn't have done that

00:02:17.120 --> 00:02:21.000 
back home and I wouldn't have done that
if<00:02:17.239> I<00:02:17.360> thought<00:02:17.510> she<00:02:17.630> was<00:02:17.720> a<00:02:17.750> risk<00:02:18.019> to<00:02:18.260> anyone

00:02:21.000 --> 00:02:21.010 

00:02:21.010 --> 00:02:23.410 

surely<00:02:22.010> you<00:02:22.370> should<00:02:22.400> be<00:02:22.790> speaking<00:02:23.209> to<00:02:23.330> the

00:02:23.410 --> 00:02:23.420 
surely you should be speaking to the

00:02:23.420 --> 00:02:24.580 
surely you should be speaking to the
family<00:02:23.750> of<00:02:23.780> the<00:02:23.900> little<00:02:24.170> girl<00:02:24.320> from<00:02:24.470> the
