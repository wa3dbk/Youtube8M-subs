00:00:13.969 --> 00:00:18.300
 hello with you again i wahoo chef van 

00:00:16.680 --> 00:00:20.160
 new clover heading ivan i will 

00:00:18.300 --> 00:00:21.990
 talk about various useful things 

00:00:20.160 --> 00:00:23.970
 influencing your interactions with 

00:00:21.990 --> 00:00:25.619
 gadgets their daily use 

00:00:23.970 --> 00:00:27.060
 and we begin with an acquaintance with 

00:00:25.619 --> 00:00:30.930
 solid state drives 

00:00:27.060 --> 00:00:32.669
 or in other words ssd disks for 

00:00:30.930 --> 00:00:34.620
 dative drive aka ssd 

00:00:32.669 --> 00:00:36.420
 is not mechanical 

00:00:34.620 --> 00:00:38.239
 based storage device 

00:00:36.420 --> 00:00:40.680
 flash memory chips 

00:00:38.239 --> 00:00:43.010
 its main advantages are 

00:00:40.680 --> 00:00:45.899
 no moving parts 

00:00:43.010 --> 00:00:47.160
 total absence of noise is high 

00:00:45.899 --> 00:00:50.010
 mechanical strength 

00:00:47.160 --> 00:00:52.379
 low power consumption as well as little 

00:00:50.010 --> 00:00:55.760
 dimensions and weight and highest speed 

00:00:52.379 --> 00:00:55.760
 read and write 

00:01:03.309 --> 00:01:07.880
 there are also disadvantages and the main one 

00:01:05.990 --> 00:01:10.040
 this is a limited number of cycles 

00:01:07.880 --> 00:01:11.360
 dubbing to deal with it uniform 

00:01:10.040 --> 00:01:13.310
 wear apply different schemes 

00:01:11.360 --> 00:01:14.750
 load balancing when 

00:01:13.310 --> 00:01:16.640
 controller create disk stores 

00:01:14.750 --> 00:01:18.260
 information on which needles how many 

00:01:16.640 --> 00:01:20.600
 once rewritten and if necessary 

00:01:18.260 --> 00:01:22.220
 swap them so this 

00:01:20.600 --> 00:01:24.229
 the problem can not pay attention 

00:01:22.220 --> 00:01:26.540
 second drawback cost price 

00:01:24.229 --> 00:01:28.310
 gigabytes of ssd-drives substantially 

00:01:26.540 --> 00:01:30.830
 higher the gigabyte price of traditional hard 

00:01:28.310 --> 00:01:33.140
 drives what does use create 

00:01:30.830 --> 00:01:35.300
 laptop or personal computer this 

00:01:33.140 --> 00:01:37.640
 Of course the speed of your laptop 

00:01:35.300 --> 00:01:40.160
 will load in seconds and programs 

00:01:37.640 --> 00:01:41.630
 will open much faster if 

00:01:40.160 --> 00:01:44.060
 you buy a new laptop or computer 

00:01:41.630 --> 00:01:46.009
 there must be ssd 

00:01:44.060 --> 00:01:48.080
 better save on the processor and 

00:01:46.009 --> 00:01:50.390
 video card but don't save on 

00:01:48.080 --> 00:01:53.600
 ssd drive already bought a laptop 

00:01:50.390 --> 00:01:54.680
 then no ssd no problem you can replace 

00:01:53.600 --> 00:01:56.410
 drive yourself 

00:01:54.680 --> 00:01:58.610
 today I will tell you how to do it 

00:01:56.410 --> 00:02:01.190
 First of all, we measure the download speed 

00:01:58.610 --> 00:02:02.840
 the notebook will make a hard drive as well 

00:02:01.190 --> 00:02:05.840
 test the old disk with 

00:02:02.840 --> 00:02:07.190
 crystaldiskmark utilities so the first thing 

00:02:05.840 --> 00:02:09.770
 we make it measure the speed 

00:02:07.190 --> 00:02:11.150
 turning on the laptop before the upgrade will be 

00:02:09.770 --> 00:02:13.310
 assume that the laptop is final 

00:02:11.150 --> 00:02:16.510
 booted at that moment in time when he 

00:02:13.310 --> 00:02:16.510
 connect to wi-fi network 

00:02:30.200 --> 00:02:36.570
 the differences are all the laptop connected to the network 

00:02:33.900 --> 00:02:39.050
 Wi fi and you can already fully them 

00:02:36.570 --> 00:02:39.050
 to use 

00:02:48.780 --> 00:02:53.580
 as you can see the old hard drive speed 

00:02:50.880 --> 00:02:56.250
 does not shine and now we start we remove 

00:02:53.580 --> 00:02:59.840
 change it to ssd and so we start 

00:02:56.250 --> 00:02:59.840
 you must first remove the battery 

00:03:03.709 --> 00:03:08.030
 then disconnect the old hard drive 

00:03:19.150 --> 00:03:26.420
 So we insert the loop, usually instructions 

00:03:24.110 --> 00:03:28.010
 laptop indicates the possibility of replacement 

00:03:26.420 --> 00:03:28.879
 hard drive and execution order 

00:03:28.010 --> 00:03:30.769
 of works 

00:03:28.879 --> 00:03:34.569
 if you doubt your power then 

00:03:30.769 --> 00:03:34.569
 contact any service center 

00:03:46.810 --> 00:03:50.390
 so they set up the place created by the old 

00:03:49.549 --> 00:04:01.099
 hard drive 

00:03:50.390 --> 00:04:02.569
 collect the laptop back and so 

00:04:01.099 --> 00:04:04.760
 operating system required 

00:04:02.569 --> 00:04:07.989
 the program is installed let's rate 

00:04:04.760 --> 00:04:07.989
 laptop download speed 

00:04:23.449 --> 00:04:26.910
 as you see in the laptop began to boot 

00:04:25.650 --> 00:04:28.560
 much faster 

00:04:26.910 --> 00:04:39.449
 and here is what the utility says 

00:04:28.560 --> 00:04:40.430
 crystaldiskmark result as they say 

00:04:39.449 --> 00:04:42.449
 on the face 

00:04:40.430 --> 00:04:43.620
 replacing the regular hard drive with 

00:04:42.449 --> 00:04:45.270
 solid state drive 

00:04:43.620 --> 00:04:47.400
 you can give to your laptop or 

00:04:45.270 --> 00:04:48.780
 computer a second wind and he's still 

00:04:47.400 --> 00:04:52.050
 some time will be faithfully 

00:04:48.780 --> 00:04:54.030
 serve you today all like 

00:04:52.050 --> 00:04:58.370
