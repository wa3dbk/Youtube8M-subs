 Attention to the review of the program which is not 

00:00:03.810 --> 00:00:08.069
 will only find a place on the desktop 

00:00:05.310 --> 00:00:10.050
 Your ios device is sure that it is 

00:00:08.069 --> 00:00:12.360
 will accommodate the docks of your iphone and for 

00:00:10.050 --> 00:00:14.009
 ipad as the main given program 

00:00:12.360 --> 00:00:16.139
 already available in the appstore is sufficient 

00:00:14.009 --> 00:00:17.670
 the amount of time is likely to many 

00:00:16.139 --> 00:00:18.210
 of you it has come across more than once 

00:00:17.670 --> 00:00:20.160
 eyes 

00:00:18.210 --> 00:00:23.070
 but most likely users 

00:00:20.160 --> 00:00:25.890
 she was distracted by her cost of 169 

00:00:23.070 --> 00:00:28.529
 rubles for what to pay that kind of money but 

00:00:25.890 --> 00:00:30.960
 see screenshots this one and view 

00:00:28.529 --> 00:00:41.489
 detailed video clip of her work is 

00:00:30.960 --> 00:00:43.590
 completely different so what drove a favor 

00:00:41.489 --> 00:00:46.260
 this program next in the first 

00:00:43.590 --> 00:00:48.120
 bos ches enter pro improves many times 

00:00:46.260 --> 00:00:50.700

00:00:50.700 --> 00:00:54.960
 icons This window is located 

00:00:53.250 --> 00:00:56.219
 the utility will be needed in various 

00:00:54.960 --> 00:00:58.410
 life situations 

00:00:56.219 --> 00:01:01.050
 and to the one who uses the iphone without releasing 

00:00:58.410 --> 00:01:03.660
 such a program will become easy for him 

00:01:01.050 --> 00:01:06.450
 necessary it is explained very simply 

00:01:03.660 --> 00:01:08.520
 and without further ado everything is as it is here 

00:01:06.450 --> 00:01:09.840
 developers offered us examples 

00:01:08.520 --> 00:01:12.060
 based on which we will 

00:01:09.840 --> 00:01:14.460
 build your own actions for 

00:01:12.060 --> 00:01:16.920
 applications are initially standard 

00:01:14.460 --> 00:01:19.229
 tasks write new messages 

00:01:16.920 --> 00:01:22.290
 perform a search on any of the configured 

00:01:19.229 --> 00:01:24.930
 resources you open bookmarks and even 

00:01:22.290 --> 00:01:26.460
 make a selfie and run it in facebook 

00:01:24.930 --> 00:01:28.710

00:01:26.460 --> 00:01:31.170
 program similar under the contact 

00:01:28.710 --> 00:01:33.659
 Now you understand what you say about the center 

00:01:31.170 --> 00:01:36.119
 besides opening programs we will also 

00:01:33.659 --> 00:01:38.369
 point them to certain goals and most 

00:01:36.119 --> 00:01:39.869
 the main thing is that all this is done when 

00:01:38.369 --> 00:01:43.890
 the help of the utility alone 

00:01:39.869 --> 00:01:46.229
 which controls everything let's point out 

00:01:43.890 --> 00:01:48.420

00:01:46.229 --> 00:01:51.240

00:02:10.050 --> 00:02:13.830
 in our own way we want

 sent utilities with 

00:02:13.830 --> 00:02:19.950

 You can put an icon on this cube with 

00:02:39.150 --> 00:02:43.040
 the ability to send a message 

00:02:48.020 --> 00:02:52.099
 there is the possibility of including ordinary 

00:02:50.760 --> 00:02:53.250
 notifications without using 

00:02:52.099 --> 00:02:55.800
 geo-locations 

00:02:53.250 --> 00:02:58.110

00:02:55.800 --> 00:03:00.120
 on arrival to the specified point on the map 

00:02:58.110 --> 00:03:02.459

00:03:02.459 --> 00:03:06.750

00:03:06.750 --> 00:03:11.160
 the message can even be set 

00:03:09.209 --> 00:03:13.620
 exactly when you need an application 

00:03:11.160 --> 00:03:20.250
 sent you impressions upon arrival to 

00:03:13.620 --> 00:03:24.590

 those who often hang out on different 

00:05:10.630 --> 00:05:15.130
 Sites I created myself a bookmark with three 

00:05:12.940 --> 00:05:19.440
 sites click on any of them 

00:05:15.130 --> 00:05:19.440

00:05:28.719 --> 00:05:33.310
 completely different data 

00:05:30.400 --> 00:05:37.090
 choice in the lodge center pro I'm sure that 

00:05:33.310 --> 00:05:39.069

 diverse sections each designed 

00:05:41.770 --> 00:05:47.050
 under absolutely any user 

00:05:44.370 --> 00:05:49.270
 I suddenly wanted to see what was now 

00:05:47.050 --> 00:05:51.639
 newcomers precisely in section free 

00:05:49.270 --> 00:05:52.750
 application appstore went into the application 

00:05:51.639 --> 00:05:55.810

00:05:55.810 --> 00:06:01.120
 my top free apps 

00:05:58.029 --> 00:06:03.430
 there are 2 themes in the settings 

00:06:01.120 --> 00:06:05.949
 white which is used now and 

00:06:03.430 --> 00:06:08.699
 dark which suits you best 

00:06:05.949 --> 00:06:08.699
 decide for yourself 

00:06:11.520 --> 00:06:16.419
 I think that such a proposal despite 

00:06:14.379 --> 00:06:18.970
 on its price tag fully deserves 

00:06:16.419 --> 00:06:21.069
