00:00:51.350 --> 00:00:51.360 
still there they'll code it at the

00:00:51.360 --> 00:00:54.229 
still there they'll code it at the
bottom<00:00:51.809> here<00:00:52.070> but<00:00:53.070> used<00:00:53.280> it<00:00:53.460> ties<00:00:53.699> at<00:00:53.879> the<00:00:53.969> top

00:00:54.229 --> 00:00:54.239 
bottom here but used it ties at the top

00:00:54.239 --> 00:00:57.700 
bottom here but used it ties at the top
just<00:00:54.390> that<00:00:54.629> bit<00:00:54.809> of<00:00:54.899> added<00:00:55.050> extra<00:00:55.230> security

00:00:57.700 --> 00:00:57.710 
just that bit of added extra security

00:00:57.710 --> 00:01:01.369 
just that bit of added extra security
the<00:00:58.710> rear<00:00:58.949> one<00:00:59.510> that's<00:01:00.510> the<00:01:00.600> real<00:01:00.780> one<00:01:00.960> fitted

00:01:01.369 --> 00:01:01.379 
the rear one that's the real one fitted

00:01:01.379 --> 00:01:04.340 
the rear one that's the real one fitted
and<00:01:01.980> a<00:01:02.340> few<00:01:02.520> problems<00:01:02.879> with<00:01:02.940> the<00:01:03.149> rear<00:01:03.359> there

00:01:04.340 --> 00:01:04.350 
and a few problems with the rear there

00:01:04.350 --> 00:01:09.670 
and a few problems with the rear there
on<00:01:04.439> my<00:01:04.619> bike<00:01:04.890> the<00:01:07.189> hose<00:01:08.189> for<00:01:08.520> the<00:01:08.549> brake<00:01:08.850> and

00:01:09.670 --> 00:01:09.680 
on my bike the hose for the brake and

00:01:09.680 --> 00:01:12.770 
on my bike the hose for the brake and
the<00:01:10.680> cable<00:01:11.070> for<00:01:11.250> the<00:01:11.310> gear<00:01:11.490> shifter<00:01:11.970> actually

00:01:12.770 --> 00:01:12.780 
the cable for the gear shifter actually

00:01:12.780 --> 00:01:15.700 
the cable for the gear shifter actually
were<00:01:12.900> along<00:01:13.170> at<00:01:13.409> the<00:01:13.470> top<00:01:13.680> of<00:01:13.799> the<00:01:13.890> seat<00:01:14.100> stays

00:01:15.700 --> 00:01:15.710 
were along at the top of the seat stays

00:01:15.710 --> 00:01:18.679 
were along at the top of the seat stays
ideally<00:01:16.710> that's<00:01:16.890> where<00:01:17.070> the<00:01:17.189> mud<00:01:17.369> howa<00:01:17.689> wants

00:01:18.679 --> 00:01:18.689 
ideally that's where the mud howa wants

00:01:18.689 --> 00:01:21.200 
ideally that's where the mud howa wants
to<00:01:18.810> sit<00:01:19.020> as<00:01:19.229> well<00:01:19.439> so<00:01:19.860> at<00:01:20.580> the<00:01:20.700> moment<00:01:20.880> it's

00:01:21.200 --> 00:01:21.210 
to sit as well so at the moment it's

00:01:21.210 --> 00:01:24.310 
to sit as well so at the moment it's
sitting<00:01:21.540> not<00:01:21.750> quite<00:01:22.020> not<00:01:22.590> quite<00:01:22.650> right<00:01:23.130> and

00:01:24.310 --> 00:01:24.320 
sitting not quite not quite right and

00:01:24.320 --> 00:01:26.149 
sitting not quite not quite right and
problem<00:01:25.320> I've<00:01:25.409> got<00:01:25.560> on<00:01:25.650> this<00:01:25.770> side<00:01:25.979> at<00:01:26.100> the

00:01:26.149 --> 00:01:26.159 
problem I've got on this side at the

00:01:26.159 --> 00:01:29.050 
problem I've got on this side at the
moment<00:01:26.580> is<00:01:26.700> here<00:01:26.970> with<00:01:27.150> this<00:01:27.530> cable<00:01:28.530> holder

00:01:29.050 --> 00:01:29.060 
moment is here with this cable holder

00:01:29.060 --> 00:01:31.999 
moment is here with this cable holder
mud<00:01:30.060> hugger<00:01:30.450> actually<00:01:30.810> comes<00:01:31.079> down<00:01:31.350> and

00:01:31.999 --> 00:01:32.009 
mud hugger actually comes down and

00:01:32.009 --> 00:01:34.490 
mud hugger actually comes down and
actually<00:01:32.130> bends<00:01:32.520> behind<00:01:33.000> it<00:01:33.270> and<00:01:33.509> then<00:01:34.200> bends

00:01:34.490 --> 00:01:34.500 
actually bends behind it and then bends

00:01:34.500 --> 00:01:40.130 
actually bends behind it and then bends
in<00:01:34.799> and<00:01:35.070> pinches<00:01:36.060> on<00:01:36.090> here<00:01:36.509> and<00:01:38.869> what's<00:01:39.869> that

00:01:40.130 --> 00:01:40.140 
in and pinches on here and what's that

00:01:40.140 --> 00:01:45.170 
in and pinches on here and what's that
is<00:01:40.409> doing

00:01:45.170 --> 00:01:45.180 

00:01:45.180 --> 00:01:47.969 

as<00:01:46.180> you<00:01:46.390> can<00:01:46.510> see<00:01:46.720> it's<00:01:47.140> not<00:01:47.409> lining<00:01:47.710> up

00:01:47.969 --> 00:01:47.979 
as you can see it's not lining up

00:01:47.979 --> 00:01:50.940 
as you can see it's not lining up
straight<00:01:48.400> now<00:01:48.729> the<00:01:49.240> other<00:01:49.420> side<00:01:49.770> isn't<00:01:50.770> a

00:01:50.940 --> 00:01:50.950 
straight now the other side isn't a

00:01:50.950 --> 00:01:53.609 
straight now the other side isn't a
problem<00:01:51.340> at<00:01:51.430> all<00:01:51.640> because<00:01:51.970> the<00:01:52.619> cable

00:01:53.609 --> 00:01:53.619 
problem at all because the cable

00:01:53.619 --> 00:01:57.210 
problem at all because the cable
housings<00:01:54.130> are<00:01:54.850> further<00:01:55.150> apart<00:01:55.659> and<00:01:56.080> the<00:01:57.070> mud

00:01:57.210 --> 00:01:57.220 
housings are further apart and the mud

00:01:57.220 --> 00:02:00.359 
housings are further apart and the mud
hugger<00:01:57.550> is<00:01:58.060> sitting<00:01:58.510> nice<00:01:58.690> and<00:01:58.720> flush<00:01:59.229> on<00:02:00.130> the

room<00:02:02.680> for<00:02:02.979> the<00:02:03.790> cable<00:02:04.180> there<00:02:04.470> it<00:02:05.470> does<00:02:05.770> seem<00:02:06.009> to

00:02:06.090 --> 00:02:06.100 
room for the cable there it does seem to

00:02:06.100 --> 00:02:09.510 
room for the cable there it does seem to
be<00:02:06.190> capturing<00:02:06.610> a<00:02:06.700> little<00:02:06.970> bit<00:02:07.119> there<00:02:08.399> okay<00:02:09.399> I'm

00:02:09.510 --> 00:02:09.520 
be capturing a little bit there okay I'm

00:02:09.520 --> 00:02:11.520 
be capturing a little bit there okay I'm
gonna<00:02:09.670> have<00:02:09.820> to<00:02:09.940> tighten<00:02:10.300> that<00:02:10.420> up<00:02:10.479> perhaps<00:02:11.350> a

00:02:11.520 --> 00:02:11.530 
gonna have to tighten that up perhaps a

00:02:11.530 --> 00:02:14.729 
gonna have to tighten that up perhaps a
bit<00:02:11.650> one<00:02:11.800> or<00:02:11.920> two<00:02:12.069> more<00:02:12.310> zip<00:02:12.550> ties<00:02:12.790> on<00:02:12.819> it<00:02:13.739> just

00:02:14.729 --> 00:02:14.739 
bit one or two more zip ties on it just

00:02:14.739 --> 00:02:17.490 
bit one or two more zip ties on it just
to<00:02:14.860> keep<00:02:15.010> it<00:02:15.280> away<00:02:15.340> from<00:02:15.520> that<00:02:16.410> snagging<00:02:17.410> on

00:02:17.490 --> 00:02:17.500 
to keep it away from that snagging on

00:02:17.500 --> 00:02:21.180 
to keep it away from that snagging on

00:02:21.180 --> 00:02:21.190 
that cable there game anyway we'll see
