00:00:06.950 --> 00:00:12.870
 hello to all of you then in 

00:00:10.680 --> 00:00:17.040
 this video i'm going to show you how 

00:00:12.870 --> 00:00:20.570
 circumvent a change that took place 

00:00:17.040 --> 00:00:28.260
 a 3ds max 2014 

00:00:20.570 --> 00:00:32.640
 compared to compare to 2013 this is the 

00:00:28.260 --> 00:00:40.100
 kid other shots of kids who settled 

00:00:32.640 --> 00:00:45.180
 stale but I'm not in the 2014 

00:00:40.100 --> 00:00:53.420
 here we have been able this option what makes 

00:00:45.180 --> 00:00:57.390
 that for example six days a file here 

00:00:53.420 --> 00:01:00.030
 fatally if the file was saved 

00:00:57.390 --> 00:01:04.650
 with gamma finally haute couture in 

00:01:00.030 --> 00:01:07.180
 zero point and goes systematically 

00:01:04.650 --> 00:01:09.310
 we display ourselves this at each startup 

00:01:07.180 --> 00:01:12.400
 strand since any end since a priori 

00:01:09.310 --> 00:01:14.560
 it's not we do not know we can not 

00:01:12.400 --> 00:01:21.820
 put it the kid of the system can not 

00:01:14.560 --> 00:01:27.550
 to be put on a zero point so how 

00:01:21.820 --> 00:01:30.000
 to counter that it's simple we're going 

00:01:27.550 --> 00:01:30.000
 go directly 

00:01:32.810 --> 00:01:39.070
 here in the file in the folder 

00:01:35.180 --> 00:01:42.170
 user abdat at local 

00:01:39.070 --> 00:01:46.009
 autodesk 3ds max the version and the 

00:01:42.170 --> 00:01:49.729
 location is again located 

00:01:46.009 --> 00:01:56.659
 are all so that's her you see a 

00:01:49.729 --> 00:01:58.869
 or this file here it is here made 

00:01:56.659 --> 00:01:58.869
 a search 

00:02:05.280 --> 00:02:11.940
 many kids 

00:02:07.700 --> 00:02:14.130
 you will arrive directly on it and 

00:02:11.940 --> 00:02:18.840
 we can actually see who is 

00:02:14.130 --> 00:02:25.880
 of course 22.2 when we are going to do everything 

00:02:18.840 --> 00:02:25.880
 just the macho 1.0 is saved 

00:02:29.670 --> 00:02:34.650
 we reopen 

00:02:31.870 --> 00:02:34.650
 in 2014 

00:02:48.439 --> 00:02:55.920
 first of all obviously he's still not 

00:02:51.090 --> 00:02:58.859
 predictable but the differences when we 

00:02:55.920 --> 00:03:04.280
 go see this one but we swell will have 

00:02:58.859 --> 00:03:07.130
 not with the gamma so here 

00:03:04.280 --> 00:03:11.050
 it is now that we will do and must 

00:03:07.130 --> 00:03:11.050
 check in the check anyway that 

00:03:12.410 --> 00:03:15.190
 that at closing 

00:03:15.850 --> 00:03:20.470
 finally say registered on bluff 

00:03:27.140 --> 00:03:30.140
 but 

00:03:32.470 --> 00:03:36.790
 any kid it's on a zero point 

00:03:37.610 --> 00:03:40.420
 It's perfect 

00:03:52.040 --> 00:04:01.410
 after normally there is no reason 

00:03:55.470 --> 00:04:07.069
 whoever this value changes 

00:04:01.410 --> 00:04:07.069
 otherwise than the plain file 

00:04:10.650 --> 00:04:13.830
 that's all
