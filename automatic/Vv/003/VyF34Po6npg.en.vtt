been bleeding through slowly over the
last<00:01:21.990> couple<00:01:22.170> years<00:01:22.350> I<00:01:22.740> reckon<00:01:23.100> where<00:01:23.640> I'm

00:01:23.719 --> 00:01:23.729 
last couple years I reckon where I'm

last couple years I reckon where I'm
sort<00:01:24.000> of<00:01:24.090> getting<00:01:24.299> to<00:01:24.479> the<00:01:24.570> point<00:01:24.810> where<00:01:25.110> I

00:01:26.679 --> 00:01:26.689 
sort of getting to the point where I

00:01:26.689 --> 00:01:30.109 
sort of getting to the point where I
can't<00:01:27.689> like<00:01:28.229> I<00:01:28.500> can't<00:01:28.740> accept<00:01:29.549> certain<00:01:29.820> things

00:01:30.109 --> 00:01:30.119 
can't like I can't accept certain things

00:01:30.119 --> 00:01:32.120 
can't like I can't accept certain things
happening<00:01:30.509> in<00:01:30.570> games<00:01:30.869> because<00:01:31.770> that<00:01:31.979> is<00:01:32.100> not

00:01:32.120 --> 00:01:32.130 
happening in games because that is not

00:01:32.130 --> 00:01:34.130 
happening in games because that is not
how<00:01:32.490> it<00:01:32.610> would<00:01:32.729> happen<00:01:32.909> in<00:01:33.270> real<00:01:33.869> life<00:01:33.900> but

00:01:34.130 --> 00:01:34.140 
how it would happen in real life but

00:01:34.140 --> 00:01:35.840 
how it would happen in real life but

here's the problem ladies and gentlemen
it's<00:01:36.570> a<00:01:36.750> game<00:01:36.960> so<00:01:37.560> that<00:01:38.340> use<00:01:38.579> alien<00:01:38.909> isolation

00:01:39.020 --> 00:01:39.030 
it's a game so that use alien isolation

00:01:39.030 --> 00:01:41.600 
it's a game so that use alien isolation
again<00:01:39.570> is<00:01:39.689> the<00:01:39.780> example<00:01:40.049> if<00:01:40.320> the<00:01:40.619> alien<00:01:41.040> or<00:01:41.430> the

00:01:41.600 --> 00:01:41.610 
again is the example if the alien or the

00:01:41.610 --> 00:01:43.670 
again is the example if the alien or the
xenomorph<00:01:41.970> is<00:01:42.390> the<00:01:42.659> most<00:01:42.840> ridiculous<00:01:43.049> killer

00:01:43.670 --> 00:01:43.680 
xenomorph is the most ridiculous killer

00:01:43.680 --> 00:01:46.010 
xenomorph is the most ridiculous killer
ever<00:01:43.920> it<00:01:44.399> would<00:01:44.579> kill<00:01:44.759> you<00:01:44.820> all<00:01:45.180> the<00:01:45.479> time<00:01:45.659> you

00:01:46.010 --> 00:01:46.020 
ever it would kill you all the time you

00:01:46.020 --> 00:01:47.240 
ever it would kill you all the time you
would<00:01:46.170> never<00:01:46.380> be<00:01:46.619> able<00:01:46.710> to<00:01:46.860> progress<00:01:47.070> through

00:01:47.240 --> 00:01:47.250 
would never be able to progress through

00:01:47.250 --> 00:01:48.859 
would never be able to progress through
the<00:01:47.520> game<00:01:47.549> because<00:01:47.970> if<00:01:48.240> you<00:01:48.360> tried<00:01:48.570> to<00:01:48.689> hide

00:01:48.859 --> 00:01:48.869 
the game because if you tried to hide

00:01:48.869 --> 00:01:50.300 
the game because if you tried to hide
from<00:01:49.079> it<00:01:49.229> it<00:01:49.409> would<00:01:49.560> just<00:01:49.680> smell<00:01:49.890> you<00:01:50.009> and<00:01:50.130> kill

00:01:50.300 --> 00:01:50.310 
from it it would just smell you and kill

00:01:50.310 --> 00:01:52.249 
from it it would just smell you and kill
you<00:01:50.340> or<00:01:50.850> somehow<00:01:51.390> detect<00:01:51.689> you<00:01:51.960> and<00:01:52.079> you<00:01:52.140> would

00:01:52.249 --> 00:01:52.259 
you or somehow detect you and you would

00:01:52.259 --> 00:01:54.319 
you or somehow detect you and you would
die<00:01:52.439> it<00:01:52.860> would<00:01:53.009> be<00:01:53.100> impossible<00:01:53.369> so<00:01:54.030> then<00:01:54.149> why

00:01:54.319 --> 00:01:54.329 
die it would be impossible so then why

00:01:54.329 --> 00:01:55.520 
die it would be impossible so then why

some capacity although i'm not sure but
it's<00:03:04.110> kind<00:03:04.410> of<00:03:04.470> it's<00:03:04.680> not<00:03:04.860> a<00:03:04.890> new<00:03:05.100> thing<00:03:05.130> to<00:03:05.489> me

more<00:04:02.640> mature<00:04:03.239> gamer<00:04:03.720> let's<00:04:03.989> say<00:04:04.200> I'm<00:04:04.440> not

00:04:04.490 --> 00:04:04.500 
more mature gamer let's say I'm not

00:04:04.500 --> 00:04:06.680 
more mature gamer let's say I'm not
going<00:04:05.160> to<00:04:05.220> say<00:04:05.400> age-related<00:04:05.640> because<00:04:06.420> you<00:04:06.540> can

00:04:06.680 --> 00:04:06.690 
going to say age-related because you can

00:04:06.690 --> 00:04:08.600 
going to say age-related because you can
be<00:04:06.780> mature<00:04:07.079> if<00:04:07.110> you're<00:04:07.410> younger<00:04:07.709> but<00:04:08.489> that

00:04:08.600 --> 00:04:08.610 
be mature if you're younger but that

00:04:08.610 --> 00:04:10.940 
be mature if you're younger but that
type<00:04:08.820> of<00:04:08.850> mindset<00:04:09.209> where<00:04:09.660> it's<00:04:10.560> kind<00:04:10.739> of<00:04:10.799> like

00:04:10.940 --> 00:04:10.950 
type of mindset where it's kind of like

00:04:10.950 --> 00:04:12.979 
type of mindset where it's kind of like
a<00:04:11.010> guess<00:04:11.280> maybe<00:04:11.549> the<00:04:11.790> eve-online<00:04:12.150> mindset

00:04:12.979 --> 00:04:12.989 
a guess maybe the eve-online mindset

00:04:12.989 --> 00:04:16.340 
a guess maybe the eve-online mindset
where<00:04:13.140> it's<00:04:14.209> you<00:04:15.209> have<00:04:15.450> to<00:04:15.690> let<00:04:16.109> every

00:04:16.340 --> 00:04:16.350 
where it's you have to let every

00:04:16.350 --> 00:04:18.110 
where it's you have to let every
everything<00:04:16.650> you<00:04:17.070> can<00:04:17.220> abuse<00:04:17.549> the<00:04:17.760> system<00:04:17.880> and

00:04:18.110 --> 00:04:18.120 
everything you can abuse the system and

00:04:18.120 --> 00:04:19.880 
everything you can abuse the system and
the<00:04:18.209> system<00:04:18.329> can<00:04:18.630> work<00:04:18.660> with<00:04:18.900> you<00:04:19.019> but<00:04:19.229> the

00:04:19.880 --> 00:04:19.890 
the system can work with you but the

00:04:19.890 --> 00:04:23.060 
the system can work with you but the
system<00:04:20.220> allows<00:04:20.430> you<00:04:20.640> to<00:04:20.789> be<00:04:21.680> realistic<00:04:22.680> in<00:04:22.950> a

00:04:23.060 --> 00:04:23.070 
system allows you to be realistic in a

00:04:23.070 --> 00:04:24.529 
system allows you to be realistic in a
sense<00:04:23.310> but<00:04:23.550> then<00:04:23.700> this<00:04:23.820> kind<00:04:24.120> of<00:04:24.210> comes<00:04:24.360> back

00:04:24.529 --> 00:04:24.539 
sense but then this kind of comes back

00:04:24.539 --> 00:04:26.070 
sense but then this kind of comes back
to<00:04:24.660> am<00:04:24.870> I<00:04:25.140> too

00:04:26.070 --> 00:04:26.080
