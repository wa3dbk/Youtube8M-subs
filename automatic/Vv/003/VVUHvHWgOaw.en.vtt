hand<00:00:25.439> but<00:00:25.590> I<00:00:25.710> guess<00:00:25.890> today<00:00:26.099> in<00:00:26.189> tiny<00:00:26.430> buddy<00:00:26.670> and

00:00:26.870 --> 00:00:26.880 
hand but I guess today in tiny buddy and

00:00:26.880 --> 00:00:31.510 
hand but I guess today in tiny buddy and
the<00:00:26.939> packaging<00:00:27.420> is<00:00:27.510> so<00:00:27.660> similar<00:00:27.949> here

00:00:31.510 --> 00:00:31.520 

00:00:31.520 --> 00:00:34.299 

it's<00:00:32.520> not<00:00:32.730> much<00:00:33.030> different

00:00:34.299 --> 00:00:34.309 
it's not much different

00:00:34.309 --> 00:00:38.959 
it's not much different

00:00:38.959 --> 00:00:38.969 
I guess he over here at the red it's got

00:00:38.969 --> 00:00:43.040 
I guess he over here at the red it's got
the<00:00:39.149> design<00:00:39.719> work<00:00:40.040> 2015<00:00:41.040> and<00:00:41.370> then<00:00:42.180> it<00:00:42.690> says

00:00:43.040 --> 00:00:43.050 
the design work 2015 and then it says

00:00:43.050 --> 00:00:45.529 
the design work 2015 and then it says
bigger<00:00:43.739> battery<00:00:44.129> with<00:00:44.399> up<00:00:44.520> to<00:00:44.610> 70%<00:00:44.969> more

00:00:45.529 --> 00:00:45.539

00:01:00.470 --> 00:01:00.480 
the first thing bigger battery so it's a

00:01:00.480 --> 00:01:02.840 
the first thing bigger battery so it's a
good<00:01:00.660> 70%<00:01:01.140> more<00:01:01.590> so<00:01:01.980> the<00:01:02.129> better<00:01:02.340> in<00:01:02.520> the<00:01:02.579> first

good 70% more so the better in the first

00:01:02.850 --> 00:01:05.719 
good 70% more so the better in the first
one<00:01:03.030> was<00:01:03.629> about<00:01:03.840> 10<00:01:04.199> hours<00:01:04.519> essentially<00:01:05.519> about

00:01:05.719 --> 00:01:05.729 
one was about 10 hours essentially about

00:01:05.729 --> 00:01:07.880 
one was about 10 hours essentially about
three<00:01:06.119> and<00:01:06.330> I<00:01:06.390> have<00:01:06.600> three<00:01:07.049> point<00:01:07.380> three<00:01:07.439> hours

00:01:07.880 --> 00:01:07.890 
three and I have three point three hours

00:01:07.890 --> 00:01:11.149 
three and I have three point three hours
I<00:01:08.010> would<00:01:08.070> say<00:01:08.310> per<00:01:08.700> charge<00:01:09.060> so<00:01:09.979> charge<00:01:10.979> it<00:01:11.070> up

00:01:11.149 --> 00:01:11.159 
I would say per charge so charge it up

00:01:11.159 --> 00:01:13.490 
I would say per charge so charge it up
once<00:01:11.430> use<00:01:12.090> it<00:01:12.240> up<00:01:12.390> talk<00:01:12.990> for<00:01:13.170> about<00:01:13.229> three

00:01:13.490 --> 00:01:13.500 
once use it up talk for about three

00:01:13.500 --> 00:01:15.770 
once use it up talk for about three
three<00:01:13.920> point<00:01:14.159> three<00:01:14.220> hours<00:01:14.610> put<00:01:15.420> it<00:01:15.509> back<00:01:15.630> in

00:01:15.770 --> 00:01:15.780 
three point three hours put it back in

00:01:15.780 --> 00:01:17.030 
three point three hours put it back in
the<00:01:15.840> case<00:01:16.020> charge<00:01:16.350> it<00:01:16.470> fully<00:01:16.590> you<00:01:16.740> can<00:01:16.920> do

00:01:17.030 --> 00:01:17.040 
the case charge it fully you can do

00:01:17.040 --> 00:01:18.469 
the case charge it fully you can do
another<00:01:17.250> three<00:01:17.490> hours<00:01:17.610> then<00:01:18.060> you<00:01:18.150> just<00:01:18.330> same

00:01:18.469 --> 00:01:18.479 
another three hours then you just same

00:01:18.479 --> 00:01:20.120 
another three hours then you just same
thing<00:01:18.689> this<00:01:19.020> case<00:01:19.350> will<00:01:19.590> charge<00:01:19.799> it<00:01:19.920> twice

00:01:20.120 --> 00:01:20.130 
thing this case will charge it twice

00:01:20.130 --> 00:01:22.670 
thing this case will charge it twice
same<00:01:21.060> thing<00:01:21.270> with<00:01:21.420> this<00:01:21.570> one<00:01:21.630> this<00:01:22.229> case<00:01:22.500> will

00:01:22.670 --> 00:01:22.680 
same thing with this one this case will

00:01:22.680 --> 00:01:24.679 
same thing with this one this case will
charge<00:01:22.950> it<00:01:23.070> twice<00:01:23.280> but<00:01:23.490> you<00:01:23.549> can<00:01:23.729> get<00:01:23.909> total<00:01:24.210> 17

00:01:24.679 --> 00:01:24.689 
charge it twice but you can get total 17

00:01:24.689 --> 00:01:26.600 
charge it twice but you can get total 17
hours<00:01:25.049> so<00:01:25.290> about<00:01:25.590> five<00:01:25.860> and<00:01:26.040> a<00:01:26.100> half<00:01:26.130> hours<00:01:26.369> I

00:01:26.600 --> 00:01:26.610 
hours so about five and a half hours I

00:01:26.610 --> 00:01:28.280 
hours so about five and a half hours I
would<00:01:26.759> say<00:01:26.909> I<00:01:27.180> should<00:01:27.540> get<00:01:27.659> to<00:01:27.780> talk<00:01:27.960> before

00:01:28.280 --> 00:01:28.290 
would say I should get to talk before

00:01:29.990 --> 00:01:30.000 
you gun this is a big improvement in my

00:01:30.000 --> 00:01:33.020 
you gun this is a big improvement in my
eyes<00:01:30.210> the<00:01:30.540> second<00:01:31.020> thing<00:01:31.170> is<00:01:31.790> improved<00:01:32.790> fit

00:01:33.020 --> 00:01:33.030 
eyes the second thing is improved fit

00:01:33.030 --> 00:01:33.950 
eyes the second thing is improved fit
for<00:01:33.299> enhanced<00:01:33.630> audio

00:01:33.950 --> 00:01:33.960 
for enhanced audio

00:01:33.960 --> 00:01:36.170 
for enhanced audio
the<00:01:34.829> very<00:01:35.040> first<00:01:35.280> one<00:01:35.400> had<00:01:35.579> no<00:01:35.729> issues<00:01:36.030> would

00:01:36.170 --> 00:01:36.180 
the very first one had no issues would

00:01:36.180 --> 00:01:38.149 
the very first one had no issues would
fit<00:01:36.420> it<00:01:36.570> fit<00:01:36.750> perfectly<00:01:37.229> it<00:01:37.829> didn't<00:01:38.070> always

00:01:38.149 --> 00:01:38.159 
fit it fit perfectly it didn't always

00:01:38.159 --> 00:01:40.190 
fit it fit perfectly it didn't always
feel<00:01:38.520> like<00:01:38.850> it<00:01:39.030> was<00:01:39.240> there<00:01:39.689> a<00:01:39.720> hundred<00:01:39.990> percent

00:01:40.190 --> 00:01:40.200 
feel like it was there a hundred percent

00:01:40.200 --> 00:01:44.120 
feel like it was there a hundred percent
secure<00:01:40.829> but<00:01:41.460> I<00:01:41.810> mean<00:01:42.810> I<00:01:42.960> shook<00:01:43.259> my<00:01:43.290> head<00:01:43.470> I<00:01:43.710> ran

00:01:44.120 --> 00:01:44.130 
secure but I mean I shook my head I ran

00:01:44.130 --> 00:01:44.870 
secure but I mean I shook my head I ran
with<00:01:44.310> it

00:01:44.870 --> 00:01:44.880 
with it

00:01:44.880 --> 00:01:46.880 
with it
like<00:01:45.090> that<00:01:45.299> it<00:01:45.540> would<00:01:45.659> never<00:01:46.170> get<00:01:46.409> would<00:01:46.680> never

00:01:46.880 --> 00:01:46.890 
like that it would never get would never

00:01:46.890 --> 00:01:49.190 
like that it would never get would never
come<00:01:47.070> out<00:01:47.549> this<00:01:47.909> one<00:01:48.150> it's<00:01:48.600> even<00:01:48.810> more<00:01:48.990> secure

00:01:49.190 --> 00:01:49.200 
come out this one it's even more secure

00:01:49.200 --> 00:01:51.140 
come out this one it's even more secure
than<00:01:49.380> that<00:01:49.560> so<00:01:49.830> the<00:01:49.950> fit<00:01:50.189> still<00:01:50.729> improved

00:01:51.140 --> 00:01:51.150 
than that so the fit still improved

00:01:51.150 --> 00:01:53.840 
than that so the fit still improved

worrying here and has audio that's a

00:01:58.320 --> 00:02:00.109 
worrying here and has audio that's a
very<00:01:58.740> welcome<00:01:59.130> change<00:01:59.159> I<00:01:59.580> did<00:01:59.850> listen<00:02:00.030> to

00:02:00.109 --> 00:02:00.119 
very welcome change I did listen to

00:02:00.119 --> 00:02:02.630 
very welcome change I did listen to
music<00:02:00.270> on<00:02:00.540> the<00:02:00.630> first<00:02:00.840> one<00:02:01.080> but<00:02:01.890> it<00:02:02.220> was<00:02:02.430> not

00:02:02.630 --> 00:02:02.640 
music on the first one but it was not

00:02:02.640 --> 00:02:03.889 
music on the first one but it was not
always<00:02:02.790> a<00:02:02.880> pleasant<00:02:03.030> experience<00:02:03.299> with<00:02:03.750> this

00:02:03.889 --> 00:02:03.899 
always a pleasant experience with this

00:02:03.899 --> 00:02:06.020 
always a pleasant experience with this
one<00:02:04.110> which<00:02:04.799> I<00:02:04.920> too<00:02:04.979> did<00:02:05.280> with<00:02:05.430> the<00:02:05.520> job<00:02:05.759> over

00:02:06.020 --> 00:02:06.030 
one which I too did with the job over

00:02:06.030 --> 00:02:08.630 
one which I too did with the job over
here<00:02:06.200> it's<00:02:07.200> essentially<00:02:07.649> more<00:02:07.890> Bud<00:02:08.429> Light

00:02:08.630 --> 00:02:08.640 
here it's essentially more Bud Light

00:02:08.640 --> 00:02:10.309 
here it's essentially more Bud Light
than<00:02:08.819> it<00:02:08.910> was<00:02:09.060> before<00:02:09.209> so<00:02:09.720> far<00:02:09.929> we<00:02:10.020> went<00:02:10.110> to<00:02:10.229> a

00:02:10.309 --> 00:02:10.319 
than it was before so far we went to a

00:02:10.319 --> 00:02:12.100 
than it was before so far we went to a
better<00:02:10.470> life<00:02:10.770> in<00:02:10.800> the<00:02:11.069> fit<00:02:11.310> and<00:02:11.550> audio

00:02:12.100 --> 00:02:12.110 
better life in the fit and audio

00:02:12.110 --> 00:02:14.840 
better life in the fit and audio
definitely<00:02:13.110> improvements<00:02:13.620> on<00:02:14.040> all<00:02:14.340> of<00:02:14.670> those

00:02:14.840 --> 00:02:14.850 
definitely improvements on all of those

00:02:14.850 --> 00:02:17.479 
definitely improvements on all of those
things<00:02:15.030> so<00:02:15.959> the<00:02:16.080> last<00:02:16.260> one<00:02:16.560> is<00:02:16.770> advanced<00:02:17.250> voice

00:02:17.479 --> 00:02:17.489 
things so the last one is advanced voice

00:02:17.489 --> 00:02:20.059

00:03:52.300 --> 00:03:52.310 
this one they've dropped the price we

00:03:52.310 --> 00:03:54.789 
this one they've dropped the price we
just<00:03:52.519> get<00:03:52.670> the<00:03:52.849> first<00:03:53.330> one<00:03:53.680> previously<00:03:54.680> was

00:03:54.789 --> 00:03:54.799 
just get the first one previously was

150 this is 130 so 20 dollars cheaper
you're<00:03:57.950> getting<00:03:58.129> better<00:03:58.310> battery<00:03:58.640> life

00:03:58.690 --> 00:03:58.700 
you're getting better battery life

00:03:58.700 --> 00:04:02.470 
you're getting better battery life
better<00:03:59.209> sound<00:03:59.599> better<00:04:00.349> fit<00:04:00.739> and<00:04:01.310> fans<00:04:02.209> force

00:04:02.470 --> 00:04:02.480 
better sound better fit and fans force

00:04:02.480 --> 00:04:04.300 
better sound better fit and fans force
control<00:04:02.870> actually<00:04:03.230> it<00:04:03.290> works<00:04:03.440> so<00:04:03.709> if<00:04:03.920> you<00:04:04.130> do

00:04:04.300 --> 00:04:04.310 
control actually it works so if you do

00:04:04.310 --> 00:04:06.430 
control actually it works so if you do
own<00:04:04.610> the<00:04:04.700> Moto<00:04:04.880> X<00:04:04.940> that's<00:04:05.870> another<00:04:06.079> reason<00:04:06.260> to
