00:00:01.650 --> 00:00:08.130
 hello again I'm jose this time we're going 

00:00:05.700 --> 00:00:11.390
 to make some peppers to accompany 

00:00:08.130 --> 00:00:14.180
 Carlos to accompany this 

00:00:11.390 --> 00:00:16.630
 tickets really are light 

00:00:14.180 --> 00:00:18.929
 practical easy 

00:00:16.630 --> 00:00:23.109
 very good witnesses above all 

00:00:18.929 --> 00:00:26.380
 we look especially on stuff we're going 

00:00:23.109 --> 00:00:29.050
 we look for yellow peppers if they get 

00:00:26.380 --> 00:00:30.849
 reds green and good the whole range of 

00:00:29.050 --> 00:00:34.530
 colors that peppers that may have 

00:00:30.849 --> 00:00:39.820
 It is ideal because the good is striking 

00:00:34.530 --> 00:00:42.489
 well he's ideal for this even if they 're 

00:00:39.820 --> 00:00:45.570
 good peppers that do not have hits 

00:00:42.489 --> 00:00:48.870
 that do not have black dots 

00:00:45.570 --> 00:00:50.370
 because it's really the secret of a 

00:00:48.870 --> 00:00:52.800
 compliance that deals with being good 

00:00:50.370 --> 00:00:55.650
 this preparation does not hurt the stomach 

00:00:52.800 --> 00:00:57.870
 do not repeat those who carry a little 

00:00:55.650 --> 00:00:59.789
 of garlic powder so 

00:00:57.870 --> 00:01:02.250
 the secret of all this getting yourself a 

00:00:59.789 --> 00:01:05.040
 bag of this supermarket and the 

00:01:02.250 --> 00:01:07.790
 rolls the bag 

00:01:05.040 --> 00:01:07.790
 the bags 

00:01:11.370 --> 00:01:23.060
 and well this we do I just gave a 

00:01:18.780 --> 00:01:23.060
 back and so it is not 

00:01:27.960 --> 00:01:35.090
 we get 

00:01:30.700 --> 00:01:38.960
 five minutes once 

00:01:35.090 --> 00:01:42.260
 and then we give him another five minutes more 

00:01:38.960 --> 00:01:44.020
 we give it five more minutes twice 

00:01:42.260 --> 00:01:47.540
 and this indicates ministers of 

00:01:44.020 --> 00:01:50.000
 good establishment now we arrived 

00:01:47.540 --> 00:01:52.540
 with this side here I have the pepper 

00:01:50.000 --> 00:01:52.540
 ready 

00:01:54.060 --> 00:01:56.960
 and they have lost 

00:01:57.080 --> 00:02:02.560
 the consistency of hard pepper and how 

00:02:00.200 --> 00:02:05.530
 you will see we have knowledge 

00:02:02.560 --> 00:02:07.760
 that the good part is very rich forgive 

00:02:05.530 --> 00:02:10.030
 much water 

00:02:07.760 --> 00:02:13.390
 these peppers 

00:02:10.030 --> 00:02:15.310
 you have to grab the ideal is the shell 

00:02:13.390 --> 00:02:17.650
 in some cases it usually comes out 

00:02:15.310 --> 00:02:19.300
 peel or cut it into four best 

00:02:17.650 --> 00:02:23.140
 knife 

00:02:19.300 --> 00:02:28.290
 here I have one we contribute in four the 

00:02:23.140 --> 00:02:28.290
 pepper in chapter 4 

00:02:28.560 --> 00:02:35.550
 we take out all the seeds 

00:02:33.650 --> 00:02:38.220
 It is easy 

00:02:35.550 --> 00:02:41.670
 and it's very good for the tickets it 's 

00:02:38.220 --> 00:02:44.370
 good also to start which for 

00:02:41.670 --> 00:02:46.560
 Accompany ideal meats what they get 

00:02:44.370 --> 00:02:47.730
 meat to make roasts in any 

00:02:46.560 --> 00:02:49.890
 part of the world 

00:02:47.730 --> 00:02:52.770
 this is ideal this would be the replacement of 

00:02:49.890 --> 00:02:54.330
 the peppers on the grill when 

00:02:52.770 --> 00:02:56.790
 we grab it, we take out the shell and 

00:02:54.330 --> 00:02:58.740
 you can give them the one that does not because the 

00:02:56.790 --> 00:03:00.030
 little face sometimes new week is all there 

00:02:58.740 --> 00:03:03.230
 people that we tell everything in the 

00:03:00.030 --> 00:03:06.519
 work they take it out actually good 

00:03:03.230 --> 00:03:06.519
 salt on the face 

00:03:06.980 --> 00:03:14.990
 we all do exactly in the process 

00:03:09.260 --> 00:03:18.760
 we open it in four we take out the end 

00:03:14.990 --> 00:03:21.260
 we take out seeds we take out everything 

00:03:18.760 --> 00:03:23.280
 would be 

00:03:21.260 --> 00:03:25.819
 good 

00:03:23.280 --> 00:03:25.819
 now 

00:03:26.510 --> 00:03:34.030
 stimulates everything exactly the same 

00:03:30.040 --> 00:03:39.549
 well now it is already all clean 

00:03:34.030 --> 00:03:41.219
 we separated the cabitos the shell and 

00:03:39.549 --> 00:03:44.650
 here is good 

00:03:41.219 --> 00:03:49.079
 let's say you clean the peppers that 

00:03:44.650 --> 00:03:49.079
 we do we put the peppers 

00:03:51.400 --> 00:03:55.510
 in 

00:03:53.110 --> 00:03:58.690
 in a tupper because this this can 

00:03:55.510 --> 00:04:01.030
 last about a week or 

00:03:58.690 --> 00:04:02.560
 week and a half just do not leave now 

00:04:01.030 --> 00:04:04.770
 let's not leave more time for the pepper 

00:04:02.560 --> 00:04:08.530
 It has a germ that does evil really 

00:04:04.770 --> 00:04:13.450
 It is very toxic but one week is fine 

00:04:08.530 --> 00:04:16.540
 to this we add garlic powder not 

00:04:13.450 --> 00:04:20.130
 a lot because this after 

00:04:16.540 --> 00:04:22.080
 from an ideal technique for 

00:04:20.130 --> 00:04:26.150
 by profession the technique for always 

00:04:22.080 --> 00:04:29.920
 the golden potatoes come out 

00:04:26.150 --> 00:04:33.040
 Here we can take out the combo 

00:04:29.920 --> 00:04:35.590
 This order comes between them and 

00:04:33.040 --> 00:04:37.240
 we put a little oil splash 

00:04:35.590 --> 00:04:40.020
 oil because if it would not stop being 

00:04:37.240 --> 00:04:40.020
 dietary 

00:04:40.470 --> 00:04:50.190
 Well, well, I'm not missing the stage 

00:04:43.410 --> 00:04:52.449
 but well there we beat it we mix it 

00:04:50.190 --> 00:04:55.240
 all right 

00:04:52.449 --> 00:04:57.969
 with the capital in place we can not give 

00:04:55.240 --> 00:05:00.270
 turns everywhere and well this what 

00:04:57.969 --> 00:05:00.270
 we leave 

00:05:01.830 --> 00:05:10.020
 minimum one day if there is trouble a few hours 

00:05:05.970 --> 00:05:11.760
 so that work will penetrate the salt and 

00:05:10.020 --> 00:05:16.409
 the 

00:05:11.760 --> 00:05:19.349
 the oil helps it for that good 

00:05:16.409 --> 00:05:22.050
 really exquisite I recommend it 

00:05:19.349 --> 00:05:24.499
 I recommend sandwich meat is 

00:05:22.050 --> 00:05:28.769
 I recommend to accompany in an entry 

00:05:24.499 --> 00:05:31.229
 also serves to decorate salads 

00:05:28.769 --> 00:05:33.659
 Russian for provides a presentation of a 

00:05:31.229 --> 00:05:36.779
 dish this the typical one would be like the 

00:05:33.659 --> 00:05:40.039
 morrÃ³n that we know argentines 

00:05:36.779 --> 00:05:43.849
 but good is something very rich and nutritious 

00:05:40.039 --> 00:05:43.849
 thank you very much see you next
