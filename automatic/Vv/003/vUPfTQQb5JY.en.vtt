00:01:08.340 --> 00:01:13.560 

so<00:01:09.340> we<00:01:09.460> come<00:01:09.670> to<00:01:09.760> the<00:01:09.850> end<00:01:09.880> of<00:01:10.210> the<00:01:10.510> ninth<00:01:10.840> round

quite sure what to say one-off odd

00:01:16.120 --> 00:01:20.500 
quite sure what to say one-off odd
action<00:01:16.720> is<00:01:16.960> about<00:01:17.550> social<00:01:18.550> looking<00:01:18.850> the<00:01:18.940> part

00:01:20.500 --> 00:01:20.510

00:01:22.550 --> 00:01:25.330 
Tony coming up with the uppercut cuffing
him<00:01:22.670> a<00:01:22.730> little<00:01:23.030> bit<00:01:23.350> one<00:01:24.350> punch<00:01:24.620> landing<00:01:25.220> in

00:01:25.330 --> 00:01:25.340 
him a little bit one punch landing in

00:01:25.340 --> 00:01:28.540 
him a little bit one punch landing in
there<00:01:25.520> well<00:01:25.730> for<00:01:26.000> Tony<00:01:26.240> but<00:01:27.010> very<00:01:28.010> strange

00:01:28.540 --> 00:01:28.550

pace<00:01:29.390> to<00:01:29.660> this<00:01:29.690> fight<00:01:30.670> most<00:01:31.670> of<00:01:31.880> that<00:01:32.000> due<00:01:32.240> to

00:01:32.260 --> 00:01:32.270 
pace to this fight most of that due to

00:01:32.270 --> 00:01:34.690 
pace to this fight most of that due to
social<00:01:32.600> but<00:01:32.930> now<00:01:33.110> I<00:01:33.350> think<00:01:33.830> Tony<00:01:34.100> is<00:01:34.220> a<00:01:34.340> little

00:01:34.690 --> 00:01:34.700 
social but now I think Tony is a little

00:01:34.700 --> 00:01:36.370 
social but now I think Tony is a little
bit<00:01:34.790> fatigued<00:01:35.180> than<00:01:35.330> so<00:01:35.510> his<00:01:35.690> technique<00:01:36.200> is

00:01:36.370 --> 00:01:36.380 
bit fatigued than so his technique is

00:01:36.380 --> 00:01:47.500 
bit fatigued than so his technique is
not<00:01:36.590> as<00:01:36.740> good<00:01:36.920> as<00:01:37.010> it<00:01:37.100> was

00:01:47.500 --> 00:01:47.510

00:01:49.990 --> 00:01:50.000 
I'll tell you what it does do it makes

00:01:50.000 --> 00:01:51.700 
I'll tell you what it does do it makes

with a pretty good left hook

00:03:30.700 --> 00:03:32.580 
with a pretty good left hook
it's<00:03:31.180> gonna<00:03:31.330> be<00:03:31.420> tough<00:03:31.599> on<00:03:31.810> to<00:03:32.020> score<00:03:32.319> yeah

they're<00:03:32.950> so

00:03:35.660 --> 00:03:35.670 

00:03:35.670 --> 00:03:38.430 

that's<00:03:36.670> the<00:03:36.850> word<00:03:37.000> I<00:03:37.150> was<00:03:37.180> thinking<00:03:37.330> of<00:03:37.750> really

00:03:38.430 --> 00:03:38.440 
that's the word I was thinking of really

00:03:38.440 --> 00:03:40.080 
that's the word I was thinking of really
are

00:03:40.080 --> 00:03:40.090 
are

00:03:40.090 --> 00:03:44.800 
are
punching<00:03:41.090> is<00:03:41.180> not<00:03:41.330> a<00:03:41.360> very<00:03:41.630> precision

00:03:44.800 --> 00:03:44.810 

00:03:44.810 --> 00:03:47.760 

first<00:03:45.380> five<00:03:45.590> six<00:03:45.890> seven<00:03:46.040> rounds

00:03:47.760 --> 00:03:47.770 
first five six seven rounds

00:03:47.770 --> 00:03:51.520 
first five six seven rounds
and<00:03:48.400> I<00:03:48.490> think<00:03:48.730> it's<00:03:48.880> fatigue<00:03:49.240> has<00:03:49.420> set<00:03:49.720> in

00:03:51.520 --> 00:03:51.530 
and I think it's fatigue has set in

00:03:51.530 --> 00:03:53.590

james toney thought the spot would be

00:04:15.990 --> 00:04:18.940 
james toney thought the spot would be
over<00:04:16.350> by<00:04:16.380> now<00:04:16.560> but<00:04:17.010> he<00:04:17.520> looks<00:04:17.730> like<00:04:17.910> he<00:04:18.180> is

00:04:30.170 --> 00:04:30.180 
for 12 and you have to think it wouldn't

for 12 and you have to think it wouldn't
be<00:04:30.510> that<00:04:30.660> we<00:04:30.780> need<00:04:30.930> to<00:04:31.050> knock<00:04:31.230> out<00:04:31.380> a<00:04:31.620> murky

salsa<00:04:32.430> hit<00:04:32.580> him<00:04:32.670> low<00:04:32.850> i<00:04:32.880> strongly<00:04:33.420> think<00:04:33.600> we

00:04:33.800 --> 00:04:33.810 
salsa hit him low i strongly think we

00:04:33.810 --> 00:04:36.200 
salsa hit him low i strongly think we
can<00:04:33.930> safely<00:04:34.200> deduce<00:04:34.560> that<00:04:34.800> from<00:04:35.040> this<00:04:35.430> punch<00:04:35.880> I

00:04:36.200 --> 00:04:36.210 
can safely deduce that from this punch I

00:04:36.210 --> 00:04:38.300 
can safely deduce that from this punch I
mean<00:04:36.930> that<00:04:37.050> was<00:04:37.290> low<00:04:37.680> and<00:04:37.710> that's<00:04:38.010> probably

00:04:38.300 --> 00:04:38.310 
mean that was low and that's probably

00:04:38.310 --> 00:04:40.760 
mean that was low and that's probably
what<00:04:38.460> hip<00:04:38.610> points<00:04:39.060> deducted<00:04:39.420> that<00:04:39.570> was<00:04:39.780> right

00:04:40.760 --> 00:04:40.770 
what hip points deducted that was right

00:04:40.770 --> 00:04:44.780 
what hip points deducted that was right
there<00:04:42.590> even<00:04:43.590> though<00:04:43.680> really<00:04:43.890> was<00:04:44.190> one<00:04:44.640> of<00:04:44.730> the

there even though really was one of the

00:04:47.950 --> 00:04:47.960 
he's thrown a few but nothing

00:04:47.960 --> 00:04:50.640 
he's thrown a few but nothing
approaching<00:04:48.960> that

00:04:54.660 --> 00:04:54.670 
and that makes this fight

00:04:54.670 --> 00:04:57.780 
and that makes this fight
more<00:04:55.210> lopsided<00:04:55.710> 4.59<00:04:56.710> two<00:04:57.070> runs<00:04:57.280> to<00:04:57.460> go<00:04:57.580> that

more lopsided 4.59 two runs to go that

00:04:57.790 --> 00:04:59.280 
more lopsided 4.59 two runs to go that
would<00:04:57.880> indicate<00:04:58.120> to<00:04:58.390> me<00:04:58.420> that<00:04:58.570> Scioscia<00:04:59.050> has

00:04:59.280 --> 00:04:59.290 
would indicate to me that Scioscia has

00:04:59.290 --> 00:05:01.230 
would indicate to me that Scioscia has

00:05:02.700 --> 00:05:02.710 
know I would think this would be that

pretty<00:05:10.650> good<00:05:10.680> come<00:05:11.010> there's<00:05:11.220> the<00:05:11.430> jab<00:05:11.700> that<00:05:12.150> he

00:05:12.290 --> 00:05:12.300 
pretty good come there's the jab that he

00:05:12.300 --> 00:05:15.470 
pretty good come there's the jab that he
is<00:05:12.770> it's<00:05:13.770> not<00:05:13.980> been<00:05:14.220> using<00:05:14.580> tony<00:05:15.090> has<00:05:15.270> just

is it's not been using tony has just
done<00:05:15.750> more<00:05:15.990> I<00:05:16.020> think<00:05:16.680> would<00:05:16.740> be<00:05:16.860> very<00:05:16.890> hard<00:05:17.370> to

00:05:17.450 --> 00:05:17.460 
done more I think would be very hard to

00:05:17.460 --> 00:05:19.070 
done more I think would be very hard to
make<00:05:17.700> a<00:05:17.730> case<00:05:18.060> for<00:05:18.090> source<00:05:18.510> of<00:05:18.660> heavenly<00:05:18.930> ones
