00:00:33.780 --> 00:00:33.790 
gonna do put a little burn test outside

00:00:33.790 --> 00:00:38.950 
gonna do put a little burn test outside
back<00:00:34.790> here<00:00:35.120> behind<00:00:35.420> our<00:00:35.570> office<00:00:36.470> and<00:00:37.930> do<00:00:38.930> a

00:00:38.960 --> 00:00:50.350 
back here behind our office and do a
quick<00:00:39.170> burn<00:00:39.470> test<00:00:39.769> on<00:00:39.980> this<00:00:40.129> new<00:00:40.280> design<00:00:49.360> maybe

00:00:50.350 --> 00:00:50.360 
quick burn test on this new design maybe

00:00:50.360 --> 00:01:00.689 
quick burn test on this new design maybe
I<00:00:50.479> made<00:00:50.690> the<00:00:50.839> door<00:00:51.049> a<00:00:51.170> little<00:00:51.530> smaller<00:00:51.860> oh

00:01:24.960 --> 00:01:24.970 

00:01:24.970 --> 00:01:30.580 

here<00:01:25.570> we<00:01:25.660> go

00:01:30.580 --> 00:01:30.590 

00:01:30.590 --> 00:01:58.030 

the<00:01:31.130> mini<00:01:31.369> stove<00:01:33.280> for<00:01:34.280> size<00:01:34.640> reference

00:01:58.030 --> 00:01:58.040 

00:01:58.040 --> 00:02:00.560 

that's<00:01:59.040> enough<00:01:59.430> spice<00:01:59.910> reference<00:02:00.390> it's

00:02:00.560 --> 00:02:00.570 
that's enough spice reference it's

00:02:00.570 --> 00:02:01.910 
that's enough spice reference it's
actually<00:02:00.960> smaller<00:02:01.200> than<00:02:01.380> the<00:02:01.620> head<00:02:01.770> of<00:02:01.800> a

00:02:01.910 --> 00:02:01.920 
actually smaller than the head of a

00:02:01.920 --> 00:02:04.580 
actually smaller than the head of a

of<00:02:06.090> how<00:02:06.270> big<00:02:06.420> it<00:02:06.480> is<00:02:06.630> because<00:02:07.530> not<00:02:07.680> everybody

00:02:08.090 --> 00:02:08.100 
of how big it is because not everybody

00:02:08.100 --> 00:02:23.649 
of how big it is because not everybody
has<00:02:08.160> a<00:02:08.310> cool<00:02:08.580> tomahawk<00:02:09.030> now

00:02:23.649 --> 00:02:23.659 

00:02:23.659 --> 00:02:26.300 

we<00:02:24.659> may<00:02:24.840> run<00:02:25.080> out<00:02:25.319> of<00:02:25.379> the<00:02:25.560> plastic

00:02:26.300 --> 00:02:26.310 
we may run out of the plastic

00:02:26.310 --> 00:02:29.149 
we may run out of the plastic
yeah<00:02:26.849> to<00:02:27.420> burn<00:02:27.569> off<00:02:27.750> the<00:02:27.780> plastic<00:02:28.319> lining<00:02:28.950> on

00:02:29.149 --> 00:02:29.159 
yeah to burn off the plastic lining on

00:02:29.159 --> 00:02:49.400 
yeah to burn off the plastic lining on
that<00:02:29.340> camp

00:02:49.400 --> 00:02:49.410 

00:02:49.410 --> 00:02:55.160 

I<00:02:51.980> guess<00:02:52.980> we<00:02:53.130> could<00:02:53.330> add<00:02:54.330> a<00:02:54.390> little<00:02:54.690> fuel<00:02:54.930> so

00:02:55.160 --> 00:02:55.170 
I guess we could add a little fuel so

00:02:55.170 --> 00:02:56.900 
I guess we could add a little fuel so
people<00:02:55.470> don't<00:02:55.650> say<00:02:55.830> well<00:02:56.010> it<00:02:56.130> goes<00:02:56.310> right<00:02:56.640> out

00:02:56.900 --> 00:02:56.910 
people don't say well it goes right out

00:02:56.910 --> 00:02:59.690 
people don't say well it goes right out
well<00:02:57.450> it<00:02:58.200> could<00:02:58.440> go<00:02:58.650> right<00:02:58.890> out<00:02:59.040> except<00:02:59.550> for

00:02:59.690 --> 00:02:59.700 
well it could go right out except for

00:02:59.700 --> 00:03:03.770 
well it could go right out except for
that<00:02:59.790> you<00:02:59.850> can<00:03:00.090> add<00:03:00.720> fuel<00:03:01.080> to<00:03:01.320> keep<00:03:01.650> it<00:03:01.800> lit<00:03:02.780> it

00:03:03.770 --> 00:03:03.780 
that you can add fuel to keep it lit it

00:03:03.780 --> 00:03:17.330 
that you can add fuel to keep it lit it
keeps<00:03:04.050> it<00:03:04.200> from<00:03:04.350> going<00:03:04.560> on

00:03:17.330 --> 00:03:17.340 

00:03:17.340 --> 00:03:19.790 

we<00:03:17.880> were<00:03:18.060> me<00:03:18.840> and<00:03:18.900> my<00:03:19.050> buddy<00:03:19.230> this<00:03:19.440> weekend

00:03:19.790 --> 00:03:19.800 
we were me and my buddy this weekend

00:03:19.800 --> 00:03:23.809 
we were me and my buddy this weekend
we're<00:03:19.950> playing<00:03:20.160> with<00:03:20.310> stoves<00:03:20.580> and<00:03:20.880> I'm<00:03:22.819> the

00:03:23.809 --> 00:03:23.819 
we're playing with stoves and I'm the

00:03:23.819 --> 00:03:26.990 
we're playing with stoves and I'm the
hobo<00:03:24.180> stove<00:03:24.450> actually<00:03:25.400> brings<00:03:26.400> water<00:03:26.700> to<00:03:26.970> a

00:03:26.990 --> 00:03:27.000 
hobo stove actually brings water to a

00:03:27.000 --> 00:03:29.930 
hobo stove actually brings water to a
boil<00:03:27.300> so<00:03:27.720> efficiently<00:03:28.290> that<00:03:28.490> the<00:03:29.490> wood<00:03:29.730> gas

00:03:29.930 --> 00:03:29.940 
boil so efficiently that the wood gas

00:03:29.940 --> 00:03:32.240 
boil so efficiently that the wood gas
stove<00:03:29.970> that<00:03:30.480> we<00:03:30.600> made<00:03:30.780> yeah<00:03:31.260> I<00:03:31.590> don't<00:03:31.950> see<00:03:32.160> any

00:03:32.240 --> 00:03:32.250 
stove that we made yeah I don't see any

00:03:32.250 --> 00:03:33.729 
stove that we made yeah I don't see any
reason<00:03:32.550> to<00:03:32.580> carry<00:03:32.880> it<00:03:33.030> because<00:03:33.240> it's<00:03:33.390> heavier

00:03:33.729 --> 00:03:33.739 
reason to carry it because it's heavier

00:03:33.739 --> 00:03:37.970 
reason to carry it because it's heavier
than<00:03:34.739> the<00:03:34.920> hobo<00:03:35.190> stove<00:03:36.440> and<00:03:37.440> of<00:03:37.620> course<00:03:37.800> this

00:03:37.970 --> 00:03:37.980 
than the hobo stove and of course this

00:03:37.980 --> 00:03:41.920 
than the hobo stove and of course this
mini<00:03:38.280> Hobo<00:03:38.640> stove<00:03:38.670> is<00:03:39.260> lighter<00:03:40.760> by

00:03:41.920 --> 00:03:41.930 
mini Hobo stove is lighter by

00:03:41.930 --> 00:03:46.309 
mini Hobo stove is lighter by
substantial<00:03:42.930> margin

00:03:46.309 --> 00:03:46.319 

00:03:46.319 --> 00:03:47.899 

it's<00:03:46.709> a<00:03:46.769> bit<00:03:46.920> smokier<00:03:47.340> than<00:03:47.400> the<00:03:47.610> big<00:03:47.760> one

00:03:47.899 --> 00:03:47.909 
it's a bit smokier than the big one

00:03:47.909 --> 00:03:53.420 
it's a bit smokier than the big one
there<00:03:48.030> wouldn't<00:03:48.299> it<00:03:48.360> it<00:03:48.659> is<00:03:52.069> for<00:03:53.069> some<00:03:53.340> of

00:03:53.420 --> 00:03:53.430 
there wouldn't it it is for some of

00:03:53.430 --> 00:03:54.710 
there wouldn't it it is for some of
those<00:03:53.549> little<00:03:53.849> twigs<00:03:54.120> I<00:03:54.269> think<00:03:54.510> we're<00:03:54.689> a

00:03:54.710 --> 00:03:54.720 
those little twigs I think we're a

00:03:54.720 --> 00:03:58.900 
those little twigs I think we're a
little<00:03:55.049> damp

00:03:58.900 --> 00:03:58.910 

00:03:58.910 --> 00:04:01.510 

so<00:03:59.510> I<00:03:59.810> guess<00:04:00.140> we<00:04:00.320> could<00:04:00.500> continue<00:04:00.830> to<00:04:01.010> add<00:04:01.220> fuel

00:04:01.510 --> 00:04:01.520 
so I guess we could continue to add fuel

00:04:01.520 --> 00:04:03.160 
so I guess we could continue to add fuel
but<00:04:01.760> there's<00:04:01.940> no<00:04:02.060> real<00:04:02.270> reason<00:04:02.300> to<00:04:02.690> know

00:04:03.160 --> 00:04:03.170 
but there's no real reason to know

00:04:03.170 --> 00:04:05.620 
but there's no real reason to know
that's<00:04:03.410> pretty<00:04:03.710> cool<00:04:03.860> pretty<00:04:04.490> cool<00:04:04.610> well<00:04:05.000> this

00:04:05.620 --> 00:04:05.630 
that's pretty cool pretty cool well this

00:04:05.630 --> 00:04:07.750 
that's pretty cool pretty cool well this
