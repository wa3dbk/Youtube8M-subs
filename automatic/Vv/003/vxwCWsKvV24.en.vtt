the<00:03:41.489> device<00:03:41.729> out<00:03:41.940> we'll<00:03:42.599> also<00:03:42.900> try<00:03:43.109> to<00:03:43.409> route

00:03:44.270 --> 00:03:44.280 
the device out we'll also try to route

00:03:44.280 --> 00:03:46.129 
the device out we'll also try to route
it<00:03:44.400> so<00:03:45.060> we<00:03:45.180> can<00:03:45.299> back<00:03:45.449> up<00:03:45.629> a<00:03:45.720> few<00:03:45.750> things

00:03:46.129 --> 00:03:46.139 
it so we can back up a few things

00:03:46.139 --> 00:03:53.330 
it so we can back up a few things
including<00:03:46.829> the<00:03:47.400> move<00:03:47.760> music<00:03:48.109> apk<00:03:52.159> so<00:03:53.159> the

00:03:53.330 --> 00:03:53.340 
including the move music apk so the

00:03:53.340 --> 00:03:55.089 
including the move music apk so the
screen<00:03:53.549> definitely<00:03:53.909> doesn't<00:03:54.150> look<00:03:54.269> that<00:03:54.299> bad

00:03:55.089 --> 00:03:55.099

00:03:55.099 --> 00:03:58.180 
screen definitely doesn't look that bad
I'd<00:03:56.099> say<00:03:56.340> the<00:03:56.430> quality<00:03:56.819> is<00:03:56.940> better<00:03:57.180> than<00:03:57.299> the

00:03:58.180 --> 00:03:58.190 
I'd say the quality is better than the

00:03:58.190 --> 00:04:03.159 
I'd say the quality is better than the
Huawei<00:03:59.190> phones

00:04:03.159 --> 00:04:03.169 

00:04:03.169 --> 00:04:06.050 

so<00:04:04.169> as<00:04:04.319> ICS<00:04:04.829> we<00:04:05.099> can<00:04:05.190> just<00:04:05.340> drop<00:04:05.519> down<00:04:05.790> go<00:04:06.030> into

00:04:06.050 --> 00:04:06.060 
so as ICS we can just drop down go into

00:04:06.060 --> 00:04:08.569 
so as ICS we can just drop down go into
the<00:04:06.299> settings<00:04:06.750> of<00:04:07.530> course<00:04:07.799> it's<00:04:08.010> a<00:04:08.129> sense
