encountered<00:00:16.740> where<00:00:16.980> when<00:00:17.670> you<00:00:17.789> boot<00:00:18.029> up<00:00:18.150> your

encountered where when you boot up your
game<00:00:18.539> your<00:00:19.109> game<00:00:19.140> is<00:00:19.680> locked<00:00:19.949> at<00:00:20.160> 30<00:00:20.550> FPS

00:00:21.310 --> 00:00:21.320 
game your game is locked at 30 FPS

00:00:21.320 --> 00:00:23.570 
game your game is locked at 30 FPS
regardless<00:00:22.320> of<00:00:22.590> whether<00:00:23.010> your<00:00:23.220> game<00:00:23.369> can

00:00:23.570 --> 00:00:23.580 
regardless of whether your game can

00:00:23.580 --> 00:00:26.450 
regardless of whether your game can
actually<00:00:24.060> outperform<00:00:24.750> that<00:00:24.840> and<00:00:25.289> in<00:00:25.800> my<00:00:26.070> case

00:00:26.450 --> 00:00:26.460 
actually outperform that and in my case

00:00:26.460 --> 00:00:29.870 
actually outperform that and in my case
i<00:00:26.730> could<00:00:26.880> run<00:00:27.210> the<00:00:27.359> game<00:00:27.539> at<00:00:27.720> 45<00:00:28.289> to<00:00:28.500> 50<00:00:28.830> FPS<00:00:29.310> but

00:00:29.870 --> 00:00:29.880 
i could run the game at 45 to 50 FPS but

00:00:29.880 --> 00:00:31.550 
i could run the game at 45 to 50 FPS but
when<00:00:30.029> I<00:00:30.060> closed<00:00:30.480> the<00:00:30.689> game<00:00:30.929> and<00:00:31.140> opened<00:00:31.500> up

00:00:31.550 --> 00:00:31.560 
when I closed the game and opened up

00:00:31.560 --> 00:00:34.580 
when I closed the game and opened up
again<00:00:31.920> it<00:00:32.189> was<00:00:32.669> locked<00:00:32.880> at<00:00:33.000> 30<00:00:33.210> FPS<00:00:33.690> so<00:00:34.320> if<00:00:34.440> you

00:00:34.580 --> 00:00:34.590 
again it was locked at 30 FPS so if you

00:00:34.590 --> 00:00:36.280 
again it was locked at 30 FPS so if you
remember<00:00:34.860> that<00:00:35.100> video<00:00:35.250> that<00:00:35.550> I<00:00:35.579> had<00:00:35.820> yesterday

00:00:36.280 --> 00:00:36.290 
remember that video that I had yesterday

my<00:00:37.290> settings<00:00:37.680> were<00:00:37.800> different<00:00:38.190> to<00:00:38.250> that<00:00:38.370> what

00:00:38.540 --> 00:00:38.550 
my settings were different to that what

00:00:38.550 --> 00:00:42.500 
my settings were different to that what
they<00:00:38.670> were<00:00:38.730> now<00:00:39.120> I<00:00:39.390> had<00:00:40.050> MS<00:00:40.559> a<00:00:40.710> off<00:00:41.160> I<00:00:41.700> had<00:00:42.300> my

00:00:42.500 --> 00:00:42.510 
they were now I had MS a off I had my

00:00:42.510 --> 00:00:45.619 
they were now I had MS a off I had my
textures<00:00:43.140> at<00:00:43.290> normal<00:00:43.950> I<00:00:44.219> had<00:00:44.940> other<00:00:45.120> settings

00:00:45.619 --> 00:00:45.629 
textures at normal I had other settings

00:00:45.629 --> 00:00:47.450 
textures at normal I had other settings
reduced<00:00:46.260> because<00:00:46.469> I<00:00:46.680> just<00:00:46.950> didn't<00:00:47.190> think<00:00:47.219> my

00:00:47.450 --> 00:00:47.460 
reduced because I just didn't think my

00:00:47.460 --> 00:00:50.150 
reduced because I just didn't think my
game<00:00:47.520> could<00:00:47.940> run<00:00:48.120> it<00:00:48.300> at<00:00:48.420> 60fps<00:00:49.200> in<00:00:49.739> fact<00:00:49.950> I<00:00:50.070> was

00:00:50.150 --> 00:00:50.160 
game could run it at 60fps in fact I was

00:00:50.160 --> 00:00:51.920 
game could run it at 60fps in fact I was
like<00:00:50.250> well<00:00:50.460> my<00:00:51.090> game<00:00:51.149> is<00:00:51.510> at<00:00:51.629> very<00:00:51.840> high

00:00:51.920 --> 00:00:51.930 
like well my game is at very high

00:00:51.930 --> 00:00:53.750 
like well my game is at very high
settings<00:00:52.500> I<00:00:52.620> had<00:00:52.770> very<00:00:52.980> high<00:00:53.160> textures<00:00:53.730> etc

00:00:53.750 --> 00:00:53.760 
settings I had very high textures etc

00:00:53.760 --> 00:00:56.360 
settings I had very high textures etc
and<00:00:54.539> it<00:00:54.989> was<00:00:55.110> locked<00:00:55.350> at<00:00:55.469> 30<00:00:55.739> or<00:00:56.010> it<00:00:56.219> was

00:00:56.360 --> 00:00:56.370 
and it was locked at 30 or it was

00:00:56.370 --> 00:00:58.279 
and it was locked at 30 or it was
stationary<00:00:57.059> at<00:00:57.270> 30<00:00:57.480> I<00:00:57.600> didn't<00:00:57.899> know<00:00:57.989> that<00:00:58.140> it

00:00:58.279 --> 00:00:58.289 
stationary at 30 I didn't know that it

00:00:58.289 --> 00:01:00.139 
stationary at 30 I didn't know that it
was<00:00:58.379> locked<00:00:58.680> so<00:00:59.190> I<00:00:59.250> was<00:00:59.340> like<00:00:59.430> alright<00:00:59.609> cool<00:00:59.730> I

00:01:00.139 --> 00:01:00.149 
was locked so I was like alright cool I

00:01:00.149 --> 00:01:01.729 
was locked so I was like alright cool I
need<00:01:00.300> to<00:01:00.390> reduce<00:01:00.690> everything<00:01:01.199> and<00:01:01.379> that's<00:01:01.559> why

00:01:01.729 --> 00:01:01.739 
need to reduce everything and that's why

00:01:01.739 --> 00:01:04.820 
need to reduce everything and that's why
I<00:01:01.770> got<00:01:02.160> to<00:01:02.280> my<00:01:02.430> normal<00:01:02.699> texture<00:01:03.149> quality<00:01:03.600> but<00:01:04.530> I

00:01:04.820 --> 00:01:04.830 
I got to my normal texture quality but I

00:01:04.830 --> 00:01:08.270 
I got to my normal texture quality but I
found<00:01:05.580> out<00:01:05.909> that<00:01:06.150> my<00:01:06.330> PC<00:01:06.960> can<00:01:07.290> actually<00:01:08.040> run

00:01:56.300 --> 00:01:56.310 
any means it is right at 30 and it

00:01:56.310 --> 00:01:57.679 
any means it is right at 30 and it
doesn't<00:01:56.640> look<00:01:56.759> good<00:01:56.820> you<00:01:57.210> know<00:01:57.390> what<00:01:57.479> I<00:01:57.540> mean

00:01:57.679 --> 00:01:57.689 
doesn't look good you know what I mean

00:01:57.689 --> 00:01:59.510 
doesn't look good you know what I mean
like<00:01:57.899> it<00:01:58.049> looks<00:01:58.409> like<00:01:58.500> console<00:01:59.040> and<00:01:59.219> also<00:01:59.430> in

like it looks like console and also in
console<00:01:59.820> looks<00:01:59.939> bad<00:02:00.210> or<00:02:00.360> anything<00:02:00.450> but<00:02:00.840> just

00:02:01.039 --> 00:02:01.049 
console looks bad or anything but just

00:02:01.049 --> 00:02:03.440 
console looks bad or anything but just
in<00:02:01.200> terms<00:02:01.229> of<00:02:01.560> comparison<00:02:01.979> if<00:02:02.280> you<00:02:02.759> have<00:02:02.909> a<00:02:02.939> PC

00:02:03.440 --> 00:02:03.450 
in terms of comparison if you have a PC

00:02:03.450 --> 00:02:05.840 
in terms of comparison if you have a PC
you<00:02:03.479> should<00:02:03.960> be<00:02:04.140> able<00:02:04.350> to<00:02:04.500> hit<00:02:04.770> more<00:02:05.399> than<00:02:05.430> 30

00:02:05.840 --> 00:02:05.850

00:02:05.850 --> 00:02:07.999 
you should be able to hit more than 30
fps<00:02:06.329> so<00:02:06.540> you<00:02:06.990> can<00:02:07.170> see<00:02:07.320> that<00:02:07.500> it's<00:02:07.649> running

00:02:07.999 --> 00:02:08.009 
fps so you can see that it's running

00:02:08.009 --> 00:02:10.430

you're<00:02:08.190> at<00:02:08.369> 30<00:02:09.030> fps<00:02:09.420> it's<00:02:09.629> not<00:02:09.810> good<00:02:10.020> I<00:02:10.200> want<00:02:10.410> a

00:02:10.430 --> 00:02:10.440 
you're at 30 fps it's not good I want a

00:02:10.440 --> 00:02:13.490 
you're at 30 fps it's not good I want a
high<00:02:10.560> FPS<00:02:10.800> so<00:02:11.790> my<00:02:12.000> thinking<00:02:12.360> was<00:02:12.780> I<00:02:13.020> I'm<00:02:13.349> going

00:02:13.490 --> 00:02:13.500 
high FPS so my thinking was I I'm going

00:02:13.500 --> 00:02:13.610 
high FPS so my thinking was I I'm going
to

00:02:13.610 --> 00:02:13.620 
to

00:02:13.620 --> 00:02:16.009 
to
tweak<00:02:13.830> some<00:02:14.069> settings<00:02:14.099> to<00:02:14.790> try<00:02:15.450> and<00:02:15.599> get<00:02:15.750> it<00:02:15.870> to

00:02:16.009 --> 00:02:16.019 
tweak some settings to try and get it to

00:02:16.019 --> 00:02:18.320

00:02:18.320 --> 00:02:18.330 
run at a higher fps and that's what I

00:02:18.330 --> 00:02:21.350 
run at a higher fps and that's what I
did<00:02:18.540> yesterday<00:02:18.720> and<00:02:19.260> that's<00:02:19.440> why<00:02:19.769> I<00:02:20.269> ended<00:02:21.269> up

00:02:21.350 --> 00:02:21.360 
did yesterday and that's why I ended up

00:02:21.360 --> 00:02:23.180 
did yesterday and that's why I ended up

00:02:23.180 --> 00:02:23.190 
reducing it to normal textures and

00:02:23.190 --> 00:02:24.830 
reducing it to normal textures and

00:02:28.610 --> 00:02:28.620 
at a high FPS and that's what I did but

00:02:28.620 --> 00:02:30.589

normal textures which I thought was

00:02:35.489 --> 00:02:39.199 
normal textures which I thought was

00:03:31.460 --> 00:03:31.470 
settings as they were when I booted up

00:03:31.470 --> 00:03:34.699 
settings as they were when I booted up
the<00:03:31.620> game<00:03:31.799> but<00:03:32.459> it's<00:03:32.669> improved<00:03:33.090> from<00:03:33.359> 30<00:03:33.690> to<00:03:34.200> 45

00:03:34.699 --> 00:03:34.709 
the game but it's improved from 30 to 45

00:03:34.709 --> 00:03:38.449 
the game but it's improved from 30 to 45
to<00:03:34.889> 50<00:03:35.250> so<00:03:35.489> at<00:03:35.790> least<00:03:36.690> a<00:03:36.900> 15<00:03:37.290> to<00:03:37.440> 20<00:03:37.470> FPS<00:03:38.220> frame

00:03:38.449 --> 00:03:38.459 
to 50 so at least a 15 to 20 FPS frame

00:03:38.459 --> 00:03:41.659 
to 50 so at least a 15 to 20 FPS frame
framerate<00:03:39.030> improvement<00:03:39.750> and<00:03:39.930> I<00:03:40.889> thought<00:03:41.310> that

00:03:41.659 --> 00:03:41.669 
framerate improvement and I thought that

00:03:41.669 --> 00:03:44.360 
framerate improvement and I thought that
it<00:03:41.910> was<00:03:42.060> just<00:03:42.329> an<00:03:42.480> Nvidia<00:03:43.319> driver<00:03:43.680> issue<00:03:44.010> it

00:03:44.360 --> 00:03:44.370 
it was just an Nvidia driver issue it

00:03:44.370 --> 00:03:47.539 
it was just an Nvidia driver issue it
could<00:03:44.609> very<00:03:44.819> well<00:03:44.910> be<00:03:45.230> but<00:03:46.230> it<00:03:46.739> turns<00:03:47.190> out<00:03:47.370> it

00:03:47.539 --> 00:03:47.549 
could very well be but it turns out it

00:03:47.549 --> 00:03:50.960 
could very well be but it turns out it
is<00:03:47.760> also<00:03:48.000> something<00:03:48.419> else<00:03:48.919> so<00:03:49.919> what<00:03:50.489> is<00:03:50.760> the

00:03:50.960 --> 00:03:50.970 
is also something else so what is the

00:03:50.970 --> 00:03:54.220 
is also something else so what is the
culprit<00:03:51.449> I<00:03:51.569> found<00:03:52.049> the<00:03:52.260> culprit<00:03:52.470> is<00:03:52.859> vsync<00:03:53.730> it

00:03:54.220 --> 00:03:54.230 
culprit I found the culprit is vsync it

00:03:54.230 --> 00:03:59.119 
culprit I found the culprit is vsync it
turns<00:03:55.230> out<00:03:55.819> when<00:03:56.819> I<00:03:56.849> have<00:03:57.150> vsync<00:03:57.870> off<00:03:58.129> this

00:03:59.119 --> 00:03:59.129 
turns out when I have vsync off this

00:03:59.129 --> 00:04:01.069 
turns out when I have vsync off this
issue<00:03:59.459> does<00:03:59.849> not<00:04:00.030> come<00:04:00.269> around<00:04:00.389> so<00:04:00.810> what<00:04:00.989> I'm

00:04:01.069 --> 00:04:01.079 
issue does not come around so what I'm

00:04:01.079 --> 00:04:02.689 
issue does not come around so what I'm
going<00:04:01.199> to<00:04:01.230> do<00:04:01.349> is<00:04:01.470> transition<00:04:01.980> the<00:04:02.099> video<00:04:02.340> what

the<00:04:50.009> game<00:04:50.190> so<00:04:50.430> it<00:04:50.550> turns<00:04:50.789> out<00:04:51.060> if<00:04:51.300> you're

00:04:51.830 --> 00:04:51.840 
the game so it turns out if you're

00:04:54.620 --> 00:04:54.630 
having this 30 FPS locking issue it is

00:04:54.630 --> 00:04:57.439 
having this 30 FPS locking issue it is
vsync<00:04:55.410> that<00:04:55.620> is<00:04:55.740> the<00:04:55.889> problem<00:04:56.340> but<00:04:56.940> the<00:04:57.240> issue

00:04:57.439 --> 00:04:57.449 
vsync that is the problem but the issue

00:04:57.449 --> 00:05:00.529 
vsync that is the problem but the issue
is<00:04:57.690> that<00:04:58.169> when<00:04:58.349> you<00:04:58.470> have<00:04:58.590> vsync<00:04:59.099> off<00:04:59.479> look<00:05:00.479> at

00:05:00.529 --> 00:05:00.539 
is that when you have vsync off look at

00:05:00.539 --> 00:05:03.680 
is that when you have vsync off look at
this<00:05:00.750> it<00:05:01.020> tears<00:05:01.889> like<00:05:02.400> a<00:05:02.430> motherfucker<00:05:03.210> I<00:05:03.419> hope

00:05:03.680 --> 00:05:03.690 
this it tears like a motherfucker I hope

00:05:03.690 --> 00:05:05.180 
this it tears like a motherfucker I hope
you<00:05:03.870> can<00:05:04.020> see<00:05:04.199> that<00:05:04.380> on<00:05:04.500> the<00:05:04.590> YouTube<00:05:04.919> video

00:05:05.180 --> 00:05:05.190 
you can see that on the YouTube video

00:05:05.190 --> 00:05:07.779 
you can see that on the YouTube video
because<00:05:06.150> it's<00:05:06.330> tearing<00:05:06.840> that<00:05:06.990> pole<00:05:07.259> is<00:05:07.500> is

00:05:07.779 --> 00:05:07.789 
because it's tearing that pole is is

00:05:07.789 --> 00:05:12.620 
because it's tearing that pole is is
frustrating<00:05:08.789> me<00:05:08.820> too<00:05:09.479> no<00:05:09.690> fucking<00:05:10.139> end<00:05:10.349> so<00:05:11.630> my

00:05:12.620 --> 00:05:12.630 
frustrating me too no fucking end so my

00:05:12.630 --> 00:05:14.779 
frustrating me too no fucking end so my
thinking<00:05:13.080> is<00:05:13.440> that<00:05:13.470> whether<00:05:13.979> it's<00:05:14.220> an<00:05:14.370> Nvidia

00:05:14.779 --> 00:05:14.789 
thinking is that whether it's an Nvidia

00:05:14.789 --> 00:05:17.870 
thinking is that whether it's an Nvidia
driver<00:05:15.210> issue<00:05:15.570> whether<00:05:16.500> it's<00:05:16.860> a<00:05:17.039> gta5

00:05:17.870 --> 00:05:17.880 
driver issue whether it's a gta5

00:05:17.880 --> 00:05:20.800 
driver issue whether it's a gta5
specific<00:05:18.659> issue<00:05:18.900> and<00:05:19.110> Rockstar<00:05:19.919> you<00:05:20.159> fix<00:05:20.460> it

00:05:20.800 --> 00:05:20.810 
specific issue and Rockstar you fix it

00:05:20.810 --> 00:05:23.149 
specific issue and Rockstar you fix it
vsync<00:05:21.810> seems<00:05:22.169> to<00:05:22.320> be<00:05:22.440> causing<00:05:22.830> some<00:05:23.009> problems

vsync seems to be causing some problems

00:05:23.159 --> 00:05:25.790

so<00:05:24.090> the<00:05:24.240> short<00:05:24.509> and<00:05:24.659> summary<00:05:25.050> is<00:05:25.229> that<00:05:25.259> when

00:05:25.790 --> 00:05:25.800 
so the short and summary is that when

00:05:25.800 --> 00:05:28.670 
so the short and summary is that when
vsync<00:05:26.280> is<00:05:26.430> on<00:05:26.669> for<00:05:27.330> some<00:05:27.569> people<00:05:28.050> and<00:05:28.259> to<00:05:28.530> my

soon as I build up the game I don't need

00:05:59.789 --> 00:06:02.240 
soon as I build up the game I don't need
to<00:05:59.909> do<00:06:00.030> my<00:06:00.180> dodgy<00:06:00.360> workaround<00:06:00.960> but<00:06:01.110> you<00:06:02.039> have

00:06:02.240 --> 00:06:02.250 
to do my dodgy workaround but you have

00:06:02.250 --> 00:06:04.990 
to do my dodgy workaround but you have
this<00:06:02.550> shitty<00:06:02.909> screen<00:06:03.210> tearing<00:06:03.620> so<00:06:04.620> my

00:06:04.990 --> 00:06:05.000 
this shitty screen tearing so my

00:06:05.000 --> 00:06:07.820 
this shitty screen tearing so my
preferred<00:06:06.000> option<00:06:06.270> until<00:06:06.900> there's<00:06:07.440> a<00:06:07.530> fix

00:06:07.820 --> 00:06:07.830 
preferred option until there's a fix

00:06:07.830 --> 00:06:10.969 
preferred option until there's a fix
it's<00:06:08.099> not<00:06:08.340> it's<00:06:08.610> not<00:06:08.789> the<00:06:09.120> ideal<00:06:09.870> but<00:06:10.680> it's

00:06:10.969 --> 00:06:10.979 
it's not it's not the ideal but it's

00:06:10.979 --> 00:06:15.620 
it's not it's not the ideal but it's
better<00:06:11.310> than<00:06:11.460> having<00:06:11.669> vsync<00:06:12.479> off<00:06:12.630> is<00:06:14.479> first<00:06:15.479> of

00:06:15.620 --> 00:06:15.630 
better than having vsync off is first of

00:06:15.630 --> 00:06:18.499 
better than having vsync off is first of
all<00:06:15.979> that's<00:06:16.979> if<00:06:17.219> I<00:06:17.340> can<00:06:17.490> get<00:06:17.610> basic<00:06:17.969> on<00:06:18.180> again

00:06:18.499 --> 00:06:18.509 
all that's if I can get basic on again

00:06:18.509 --> 00:06:21.950 
all that's if I can get basic on again
because<00:06:18.960> it's<00:06:19.199> it's<00:06:19.830> killing<00:06:20.219> me<00:06:20.370> so<00:06:21.240> vsync<00:06:21.750> on

00:06:21.950 --> 00:06:21.960 
because it's it's killing me so vsync on

00:06:21.960 --> 00:06:26.959 
because it's it's killing me so vsync on
right<00:06:22.949> and<00:06:23.190> the<00:06:23.550> workaround<00:06:24.180> is<00:06:25.490> turning<00:06:26.490> msaa

00:06:26.959 --> 00:06:26.969 
right and the workaround is turning msaa

00:06:26.969 --> 00:06:31.580 
right and the workaround is turning msaa
off<00:06:28.759> applying<00:06:29.759> your<00:06:29.940> settings<00:06:30.469> turning<00:06:31.469> it

00:06:31.580 --> 00:06:31.590 
off applying your settings turning it

00:06:31.590 --> 00:06:34.670 
off applying your settings turning it
back<00:06:31.770> on<00:06:32.389> applying<00:06:33.389> your<00:06:33.570> settings<00:06:33.990> keep<00:06:34.440> new

back on applying your settings keep new

00:06:34.680 --> 00:06:37.969 
back on applying your settings keep new
settings<00:06:35.070> that<00:06:35.760> is<00:06:36.150> the<00:06:36.330> workaround<00:06:36.930> if<00:06:37.229> if

00:06:37.969 --> 00:06:37.979 
settings that is the workaround if if

00:06:37.979 --> 00:06:39.950 
settings that is the workaround if if
you<00:06:38.159> are<00:06:38.279> facing<00:06:38.699> the<00:06:38.789> 30<00:06:39.000> FPS<00:06:39.419> locking<00:06:39.779> issue

00:06:39.950 --> 00:06:39.960 
you are facing the 30 FPS locking issue

00:06:39.960 --> 00:06:40.740 
you are facing the 30 FPS locking issue
it's<00:06:40.349> a

00:06:40.740 --> 00:06:40.750 
it's a

00:06:40.750 --> 00:06:43.050 
it's a
exactly<00:06:41.230> as<00:06:41.320> I<00:06:41.440> showed<00:06:41.740> it<00:06:41.920> I<00:06:42.040> mean<00:06:42.640> in<00:06:42.760> the

00:06:43.050 --> 00:06:43.060 
exactly as I showed it I mean in the

00:06:43.060 --> 00:06:44.610 
exactly as I showed it I mean in the
beginning<00:06:43.510> of<00:06:43.570> the<00:06:43.690> video<00:06:43.840> and<00:06:44.170> as<00:06:44.320> you<00:06:44.470> see

00:06:44.610 --> 00:06:44.620 
beginning of the video and as you see

00:06:44.620 --> 00:06:46.140 
beginning of the video and as you see
now<00:06:44.860> there<00:06:45.160> is<00:06:45.250> no<00:06:45.400> more<00:06:45.430> screen<00:06:45.820> tearing

00:06:46.140 --> 00:06:46.150 
now there is no more screen tearing

00:06:46.150 --> 00:06:47.220 
now there is no more screen tearing
because<00:06:46.210> vsync<00:06:46.690> is<00:06:46.810> on

00:06:47.220 --> 00:06:47.230 
because vsync is on

00:06:47.230 --> 00:06:49.470 
because vsync is on
so<00:06:47.950> anyways<00:06:48.220> wastelanders<00:06:48.850> I<00:06:49.090> thought<00:06:49.360> I'd
