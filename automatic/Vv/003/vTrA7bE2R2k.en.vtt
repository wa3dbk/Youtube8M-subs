00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:12.019
 I 'm using both sides of the software now for shake, but actually it has been several years so far 

00:00:05.970 --> 00:00:19.460
 There was a time that was in play back surface Put the table soft 8 tablets 

00:00:12.019 --> 00:00:26.150
 And I think that it is very good when I actually try to hit the front team quick attack this time 

00:00:19.460 --> 00:00:28.530
 People who want to take a proactive initiative Speaking of the likes I think that you also want to introduce to you in some of the 

00:00:26.150 --> 00:00:34.240
 It is grain high rubber for 

00:00:28.530 --> 00:00:38.990
 When I compare the body and the normal scura that I was disliked this time 

00:00:34.240 --> 00:00:44.690
 Eyes saw, such as grain shape and height is no different 

00:00:38.990 --> 00:00:47.840
 However, when I actually hit it, there was a feature of the body that I like and dislike 

00:00:44.690 --> 00:00:54.200
 It is the stability of the block 

00:00:47.840 --> 00:00:56.410
 Only this can attack with the particle height with sponge, and it will return stably only by hitting the block 

00:00:54.200 --> 00:01:00.220
 Rubber is the first time 

00:00:56.410 --> 00:01:04.690
 This same kind of body is a normal favorite 

00:01:00.220 --> 00:01:10.360
 There is ox 0.5 mm-0.8 mm 

00:01:04.690 --> 00:01:13.820
 And in this video I used a thickness of 0.5 mm 

00:01:10.360 --> 00:01:16.570
 Then please watch the play video 

00:01:13.820 --> 00:01:16.570
 th 

00:01:19.820 --> 00:01:28.909
 At first it is bag which we want to back 

00:01:23.340 --> 00:01:35.820
 This can be played like normal grain height 

00:01:28.909 --> 00:01:40.440
 There is a sense of stability on the whole such as the push has become very easy to use 

00:01:35.820 --> 00:01:45.940
 And it is a bit confusing in the video 

00:01:40.440 --> 00:01:50.200
 There is a slight increase in the ball that has made the best effort 

00:01:45.940 --> 00:01:57.030
 This makes the rubber softer by becoming a body 

00:01:50.200 --> 00:01:57.030
 I think that it would be have come up with growth by watching practice of call is getting better 

00:01:57.570 --> 00:02:06.380
 By push the ball and there is a faster and more growth 

00:02:02.280 --> 00:02:06.380
 I think that the other party also feels unique 

00:02:07.490 --> 00:02:12.399
 It was easy to do the attack of meeting the coffee shop 

00:02:14.120 --> 00:02:16.840
 there were 

00:02:17.810 --> 00:02:28.560
 Next is the back block yeah 

00:02:21.540 --> 00:02:34.349
 I 'm disgusted this time and here is the place I want you to pay attention most 

00:02:28.560 --> 00:02:37.030
 Adjust the angle firmly when driven by the opponent if it is normal grain height 

00:02:34.349 --> 00:02:41.560
 I do not go and not to drop fees 

00:02:37.030 --> 00:02:45.600
 Body but this much to the tremendous only hit the racket 

00:02:41.560 --> 00:02:45.600
 Become a knuckle boy and enter 

00:02:47.040 --> 00:02:52.960
 So if the other party does not fit well 

00:02:50.640 --> 00:02:56.910
 Can not return 

00:02:52.960 --> 00:03:02.630
 And I think I see and understand 

00:02:56.910 --> 00:03:02.630
 Little need to adjust the racket angle 

00:03:03.250 --> 00:03:14.269
 I have used so many grain heights and colors so far 

00:03:09.590 --> 00:03:18.019
 Just hit the block hit by the particle height of the sponge 

00:03:14.269 --> 00:03:22.180
 This is a stable rubber this 

00:03:18.019 --> 00:03:22.180
 I dislike the body was a teammate 

00:03:22.840 --> 00:03:34.739
 Do not swung moving opponent will move firmly to do is your own shed 

00:03:30.069 --> 00:03:34.739
 It is a very troublesome rubber for the other party 

00:03:36.340 --> 00:03:39.730
 And 

00:03:37.610 --> 00:03:44.489
 Because control is good, too 

00:03:39.730 --> 00:03:44.489
 I can go to the course that became 

00:03:49.670 --> 00:03:58.510
 You can see the mark of the ball even in the replay and firmly 

00:03:54.170 --> 00:03:58.510
 I think that I understand that it has become a rack 

00:04:01.060 --> 00:04:06.720
 It was also very easy to target the course like 

00:04:09.250 --> 00:04:12.810
 Next is receive 

00:04:13.410 --> 00:04:24.680
 It became easier to attack by becoming a liking body 

00:04:18.390 --> 00:04:24.680
 It will be able to continue attacking to take the initiative from the receive 

00:04:26.270 --> 00:04:37.630
 Receive flicks and sinks and it's easy to beat today 

00:04:32.900 --> 00:04:37.630
 I get enough speed too 

00:04:39.340 --> 00:04:46.889
 It is amazing that you can take the lead first from the table top 

00:04:43.030 --> 00:04:46.889
 I think it will come in fashion 

00:04:52.040 --> 00:04:54.760
 Yeah yeah yeah 

00:04:57.230 --> 00:05:07.910
 And from here we will continue to attack 

00:05:01.810 --> 00:05:13.430
 At first it is the fourth ball attack after doing the next to the opponent bag deeply 

00:05:07.910 --> 00:05:15.800
 In this type 10, it will be disadvantageous if you turn to the reception, so take the lead as much as possible 

00:05:13.430 --> 00:05:22.639
 It is important to go 

00:05:15.800 --> 00:05:24.900
 However, it is limited to the push etc. by all means even if the other party does the tsutsuki of the original grain height 

00:05:22.639 --> 00:05:28.320
 I will 

00:05:24.900 --> 00:05:35.430
 If you like your hand you can attack and 

00:05:28.320 --> 00:05:41.040
 It can speed also go rock out attack in the us out enough by Ida resistance 

00:05:35.430 --> 00:05:44.960
 By all means once such people that I want to firmly stop the opponent of the drive you want to attack from their own 

00:05:41.040 --> 00:05:44.960
 I want to use a rubber 

00:05:49.050 --> 00:05:57.710
 And then I tried to attack continuously 

00:05:52.639 --> 00:06:01.129
 Ikeru proceed ahead from either have stretched the table in this direction 

00:05:57.710 --> 00:06:05.300
 The style is easy to take the first 

00:06:01.129 --> 00:06:11.330
 Because the weight of the racket is light, you can swing it out firmly 

00:06:05.300 --> 00:06:16.569
 So from the foreground, you can attack up against the down rotation, of course 

00:06:11.330 --> 00:06:16.569
 I could do round play such as bags well 

00:06:16.940 --> 00:06:25.320
 How was the play video 

00:06:19.810 --> 00:06:25.320
 There are two main features of this body that you like and dislike 

00:06:25.580 --> 00:06:32.900
 The first one became main even with this video 

00:06:29.210 --> 00:06:38.630
 It is the stability of the block against the drive 

00:06:32.900 --> 00:06:40.289
 This rubber is top class in stability among the foreign rubbers I have used so far 

00:06:38.630 --> 00:06:44.610
 was 

00:06:40.289 --> 00:06:48.479
 Not only that, but this blocked ball is so awesome 

00:06:44.610 --> 00:06:54.059
 I think I knew it was going to be a knuckle and coming back 

00:06:48.479 --> 00:06:59.550
 And it's easy to control, so the ball firmly hit by the ball hit by the opponent 

00:06:54.059 --> 00:07:00.310
 It is possible to transform the ball and aim at the ball that the other party has connected and hit it 

00:06:59.550 --> 00:07:01.080
 I will 

00:07:00.310 --> 00:07:07.680
 Hmm 

00:07:01.080 --> 00:07:09.060
 The second feature is that the ball speed up and attack power can be increased by becoming a bad weather 

00:07:07.680 --> 00:07:15.389
 I can do it 

00:07:09.060 --> 00:07:17.129
 And it is hard to be affected by the rotation, so shake flicks and smashes on the table firmly 

00:07:15.389 --> 00:07:21.210
 Can beat 

00:07:17.129 --> 00:07:27.690
 Such will always be possible to attack and took the initiative in the 

00:07:21.210 --> 00:07:31.320
 Because the play style of this double-sided person is not seen so much yet 

00:07:27.690 --> 00:07:36.980
 It is good to fight with a simple tactic and 

00:07:31.320 --> 00:07:40.760
 Anyway , I think it would be interesting to use a tactic that the other party dislikes 

00:07:36.980 --> 00:07:44.870
 We can recommend players from the table software 

00:07:40.760 --> 00:07:47.969
 One and the stable who want change in the grain high 

00:07:44.870 --> 00:07:53.350
 If you want to torment their opponents with a knuckle block 

00:07:47.969 --> 00:07:57.520
 It is recommended for those who want to increase attack power by grain height more 

00:07:53.350 --> 00:08:03.670
 I hate this after all , the body is stable 

00:07:57.520 --> 00:08:07.729
 Come to anyone who wants to increase the more defense only of the block is very friendly since shed 

00:08:03.670 --> 00:08:13.449
 It is a rubber that you want to try once 

00:08:07.729 --> 00:08:13.449
 Thank you We look forward to everyone like your order
