it firing so to start off this is a
straighten<00:00:14.690> which<00:00:15.110> is<00:00:15.350> an<00:00:15.800> integration<00:00:16.609> of<00:00:16.640> a

00:00:17.080 --> 00:00:17.090 
straighten which is an integration of a

00:00:17.090 --> 00:00:19.630 
straighten which is an integration of a
strife<00:00:17.539> in<00:00:17.869> a<00:00:18.260> raven<00:00:18.710> shell<00:00:19.010> the<00:00:19.220> raven

strife in a raven shell the raven

00:00:19.640 --> 00:00:22.180 
strife in a raven shell the raven
doesn't<00:00:20.270> actually<00:00:20.420> shoot<00:00:20.930> anything<00:00:21.410> but<00:00:22.010> it's

00:00:22.180 --> 00:00:22.190 
doesn't actually shoot anything but it's

00:00:22.190 --> 00:00:24.040 
doesn't actually shoot anything but it's
for<00:00:22.430> the<00:00:22.520> stock<00:00:22.850> because<00:00:23.270> the<00:00:23.449> stock<00:00:23.720> is<00:00:23.930> very

00:00:24.040 --> 00:00:24.050 
for the stock because the stock is very

00:00:24.050 --> 00:00:26.590 
for the stock because the stock is very
comfortable<00:00:24.740> and<00:00:25.010> it<00:00:25.730> also<00:00:25.910> makes<00:00:26.330> it<00:00:26.449> look

00:00:26.590 --> 00:00:26.600 
comfortable and it also makes it look

00:00:26.600 --> 00:00:28.930 
comfortable and it also makes it look
very<00:00:26.810> cool<00:00:27.080> in<00:00:27.619> this<00:00:27.800> project<00:00:28.100> i<00:00:28.460> was<00:00:28.580> trying

00:00:28.930 --> 00:00:28.940 
very cool in this project i was trying

00:00:28.940 --> 00:00:31.900 
very cool in this project i was trying
to<00:00:29.119> replicate<00:00:29.570> coop<00:00:30.170> 77<00:00:30.830> to<00:00:31.010> s<00:00:31.070> first<00:00:31.310> Raven

00:00:31.900 --> 00:00:31.910 
to replicate coop 77 to s first Raven

00:00:31.910 --> 00:00:34.329 
to replicate coop 77 to s first Raven
and<00:00:32.149> I<00:00:32.419> think<00:00:32.629> I<00:00:32.719> did<00:00:32.899> a<00:00:32.930> pretty<00:00:33.019> good<00:00:33.350> job<00:00:33.409> this

00:00:34.329 --> 00:00:34.339 
and I think I did a pretty good job this

00:00:34.339 --> 00:00:37.419 
and I think I did a pretty good job this
is<00:00:34.399> a<00:00:34.940> cyclone<00:00:35.449> shock<00:00:35.719> attachment<00:00:36.379> and<00:00:36.530> I<00:00:37.280> know

00:00:37.419 --> 00:00:37.429 
is a cyclone shock attachment and I know

00:00:37.429 --> 00:00:39.520 
is a cyclone shock attachment and I know
that<00:00:37.760> Hughes<00:00:38.179> the<00:00:38.390> strong<00:00:38.719> arm<00:00:38.960> but<00:00:39.170> I<00:00:39.199> wanted

00:00:39.520 --> 00:00:39.530 
that Hughes the strong arm but I wanted

00:00:39.530 --> 00:00:42.579 
that Hughes the strong arm but I wanted
to<00:00:39.679> be<00:00:39.769> different<00:00:40.219> so<00:00:40.399> I<00:00:40.789> used<00:00:41.269> a<00:00:41.569> mega<00:00:42.109> cyclone

00:00:42.579 --> 00:00:42.589 
to be different so I used a mega cyclone

00:00:42.589 --> 00:00:45.129 
to be different so I used a mega cyclone
shock<00:00:42.859> so<00:00:43.399> now<00:00:43.579> I'll<00:00:43.879> cover<00:00:44.179> the<00:00:44.510> internal

00:00:45.129 --> 00:00:45.139 
shock so now I'll cover the internal

00:00:45.139 --> 00:00:48.099 
shock so now I'll cover the internal
modifications<00:00:45.889> for<00:00:46.639> the<00:00:46.819> strife<00:00:47.329> I<00:00:47.600> took<00:00:47.960> out

00:00:48.099 --> 00:00:48.109 
modifications for the strife I took out

00:00:48.109 --> 00:00:50.709 
modifications for the strife I took out
the<00:00:48.379> resistors<00:00:49.069> the<00:00:49.339> thermistor<00:00:49.909> some<00:00:50.569> of<00:00:50.629> the

00:00:50.709 --> 00:00:50.719 
the resistors the thermistor some of the

00:00:50.719 --> 00:00:53.349 
the resistors the thermistor some of the
electronical<00:00:51.440> locks<00:00:51.679> so<00:00:52.190> that<00:00:52.219> I<00:00:52.399> can<00:00:52.819> leave

00:00:53.349 --> 00:00:53.359 
electronical locks so that I can leave

00:00:53.359 --> 00:00:55.959 
electronical locks so that I can leave
my<00:00:53.539> access<00:00:53.989> door<00:00:54.229> open<00:00:54.589> and<00:00:54.829> I<00:00:55.489> don't<00:00:55.549> have<00:00:55.819> to

00:00:55.959 --> 00:00:55.969 
my access door open and I don't have to

00:00:55.969 --> 00:00:58.689 
my access door open and I don't have to
have<00:00:56.059> a<00:00:56.089> clip<00:00:56.479> in<00:00:56.659> to<00:00:56.929> rev<00:00:57.289> the<00:00:57.530> gun<00:00:57.709> that's

00:00:58.689 --> 00:00:58.699 
have a clip in to rev the gun that's

00:00:58.699 --> 00:01:00.579 
have a clip in to rev the gun that's
basically<00:00:59.089> all<00:00:59.299> I<00:00:59.329> did<00:00:59.449> to<00:00:59.749> the<00:00:59.869> strife<00:01:00.170> I<00:01:00.409> did

00:01:00.579 --> 00:01:00.589 
basically all I did to the strife I did

00:01:00.589 --> 00:01:02.169 
basically all I did to the strife I did
lubricate<00:01:01.010> the<00:01:01.159> trigger<00:01:01.399> so<00:01:01.639> it<00:01:01.760> is<00:01:01.850> a<00:01:01.879> little

00:01:02.169 --> 00:01:02.179 
lubricate the trigger so it is a little

00:01:02.179 --> 00:01:04.780 
lubricate the trigger so it is a little
smoother<00:01:02.629> now<00:01:02.839> but<00:01:03.170> that's<00:01:03.589> basically<00:01:04.100> it<00:01:04.519> I

00:01:04.780 --> 00:01:04.790 
smoother now but that's basically it I

00:01:04.790 --> 00:01:08.620 
smoother now but that's basically it I
integrated<00:01:05.750> this<00:01:06.050> raven<00:01:06.560> shell<00:01:06.890> and<00:01:07.480> it<00:01:08.480> acts

00:01:08.620 --> 00:01:08.630 
integrated this raven shell and it acts

00:01:08.630 --> 00:01:11.050 
integrated this raven shell and it acts
as<00:01:08.870> a<00:01:08.900> stop<00:01:09.260> I<00:01:09.590> have<00:01:10.010> a<00:01:10.040> video<00:01:10.460> showing<00:01:10.760> how<00:01:11.030> I

00:01:11.050 --> 00:01:11.060 
as a stop I have a video showing how I

00:01:11.060 --> 00:01:13.570 
as a stop I have a video showing how I
did<00:01:11.390> that<00:01:11.630> and<00:01:11.840> I'll<00:01:12.830> put<00:01:13.040> a<00:01:13.070> link<00:01:13.310> to<00:01:13.400> the

00:01:13.570 --> 00:01:13.580 
did that and I'll put a link to the

00:01:13.580 --> 00:01:15.550 
did that and I'll put a link to the
video<00:01:13.790> in<00:01:13.970> the<00:01:14.090> description<00:01:14.330> box<00:01:14.810> but

00:01:15.550 --> 00:01:15.560 
video in the description box but

00:01:15.560 --> 00:01:18.430 
video in the description box but
basically<00:01:16.370> what<00:01:16.580> I<00:01:16.610> did<00:01:16.730> is<00:01:16.880> I<00:01:17.210> cut<00:01:17.570> off<00:01:17.960> the

00:01:18.430 --> 00:01:18.440 
basically what I did is I cut off the

00:01:18.440 --> 00:01:21.940 
basically what I did is I cut off the
Raven<00:01:19.040> right<00:01:19.250> about<00:01:19.580> here<00:01:20.120> and<00:01:20.240> then<00:01:20.330> I<00:01:21.140> glued

00:01:21.940 --> 00:01:21.950 
Raven right about here and then I glued

00:01:21.950 --> 00:01:24.790 
Raven right about here and then I glued
it<00:01:22.100> on<00:01:22.280> to<00:01:22.460> the<00:01:22.580> strife<00:01:22.880> and<00:01:23.180> I<00:01:23.840> used<00:01:24.110> epoxy

00:01:24.790 --> 00:01:24.800 
it on to the strife and I used epoxy

00:01:24.800 --> 00:01:26.950 
it on to the strife and I used epoxy
putty<00:01:24.950> to<00:01:25.490> make<00:01:25.700> sure<00:01:25.940> that<00:01:26.150> me<00:01:26.330> integration

00:01:26.950 --> 00:01:26.960 
putty to make sure that me integration

00:01:26.960 --> 00:01:29.350 
putty to make sure that me integration
was<00:01:27.140> very<00:01:27.350> smooth<00:01:27.680> that's<00:01:28.520> all<00:01:28.790> the<00:01:29.030> raven

00:01:29.350 --> 00:01:29.360 
was very smooth that's all the raven

00:01:29.360 --> 00:01:30.910 
was very smooth that's all the raven
really<00:01:29.720> doesn't<00:01:30.050> do<00:01:30.140> anything<00:01:30.500> but<00:01:30.710> it<00:01:30.800> does

00:01:30.910 --> 00:01:30.920 
really doesn't do anything but it does

00:01:30.920 --> 00:01:33.220 
really doesn't do anything but it does
hold<00:01:31.100> an<00:01:31.280> extra<00:01:31.520> clip<00:01:31.910> which<00:01:32.150> is<00:01:32.300> nice<00:01:32.480> now

00:01:33.220 --> 00:01:33.230 
hold an extra clip which is nice now

00:01:33.230 --> 00:01:35.290 
hold an extra clip which is nice now
moving<00:01:33.560> on<00:01:33.650> to<00:01:33.770> this<00:01:33.950> front<00:01:34.190> attachment<00:01:34.760> this

00:01:35.290 --> 00:01:35.300 
moving on to this front attachment this

00:01:35.300 --> 00:01:36.580 
moving on to this front attachment this
front<00:01:35.540> attachment<00:01:36.020> still<00:01:36.290> remains

00:01:36.580 --> 00:01:36.590 
front attachment still remains

00:01:36.590 --> 00:01:39.340 
front attachment still remains
detachable<00:01:37.130> so<00:01:37.970> this<00:01:38.210> attachment<00:01:38.600> is<00:01:38.960> a

00:01:39.340 --> 00:01:39.350 
detachable so this attachment is a

00:01:39.350 --> 00:01:42.070 
detachable so this attachment is a
cyclone<00:01:40.190> shock<00:01:40.490> right<00:01:40.970> here<00:01:41.240> which<00:01:41.780> is

00:01:42.070 --> 00:01:42.080 
cyclone shock right here which is

00:01:42.080 --> 00:01:44.890 
cyclone shock right here which is
integrated<00:01:42.560> into<00:01:42.890> a<00:01:43.100> retaliate<00:01:44.090> ER<00:01:44.120> or<00:01:44.420> recon

00:01:44.890 --> 00:01:44.900 
integrated into a retaliate ER or recon

00:01:44.900 --> 00:01:46.810 
integrated into a retaliate ER or recon
barrel<00:01:45.230> this<00:01:45.530> is<00:01:45.680> actually<00:01:46.100> a<00:01:46.130> recon<00:01:46.520> barrel

00:01:46.810 --> 00:01:46.820 
barrel this is actually a recon barrel

00:01:46.820 --> 00:01:50.680 
barrel this is actually a recon barrel
so<00:01:47.510> what<00:01:47.690> I<00:01:47.720> did<00:01:47.960> is<00:01:48.140> I<00:01:48.280> epoxy<00:01:49.280> the<00:01:49.690> cyclone

00:01:50.680 --> 00:01:50.690 
so what I did is I epoxy the cyclone

00:01:50.690 --> 00:01:54.490 
so what I did is I epoxy the cyclone
shock<00:01:50.990> with<00:01:51.710> epoxy<00:01:52.670> putty<00:01:52.850> and<00:01:53.150> I<00:01:53.930> had<00:01:54.260> to

00:01:54.490 --> 00:01:54.500 
shock with epoxy putty and I had to

00:01:54.500 --> 00:01:56.620 
shock with epoxy putty and I had to
modify<00:01:54.830> the<00:01:55.010> shell<00:01:55.490> underneath<00:01:56.000> a<00:01:56.270> little<00:01:56.480> bit

00:01:56.620 --> 00:01:56.630 
modify the shell underneath a little bit

00:01:56.630 --> 00:01:58.990 
modify the shell underneath a little bit
because<00:01:56.780> it<00:01:56.960> has<00:01:57.110> a<00:01:57.140> foregrip<00:01:57.800> in<00:01:58.010> stock<00:01:58.670> form

00:01:58.990 --> 00:01:59.000 
because it has a foregrip in stock form

00:01:59.000 --> 00:02:01.719 
because it has a foregrip in stock form
so<00:01:59.270> I<00:01:59.300> cut<00:01:59.780> that<00:01:59.960> down<00:02:00.229> and<00:02:00.590> cut<00:02:01.130> a<00:02:01.159> little<00:02:01.340> slot

00:02:01.719 --> 00:02:01.729 
so I cut that down and cut a little slot

00:02:01.729 --> 00:02:03.430 
so I cut that down and cut a little slot
so<00:02:02.240> that<00:02:02.450> it<00:02:02.690> would<00:02:02.810> fit<00:02:02.990> very<00:02:03.020> nicely

00:02:03.430 --> 00:02:03.440 
so that it would fit very nicely

00:02:03.440 --> 00:02:05.649 
so that it would fit very nicely
underneath<00:02:03.920> the<00:02:04.370> retaliator<00:02:05.030> barrel<00:02:05.390> and

00:02:05.649 --> 00:02:05.659 
underneath the retaliator barrel and

00:02:05.659 --> 00:02:08.600 
underneath the retaliator barrel and
then<00:02:06.170> I<00:02:06.200> have<00:02:06.560> two<00:02:06.880> pieces<00:02:07.880> of

00:02:08.600 --> 00:02:08.610 
then I have two pieces of

00:02:08.610 --> 00:02:11.390 
then I have two pieces of
PVC<00:02:09.210> pipe<00:02:09.479> it's<00:02:09.960> actually<00:02:10.259> CPVC<00:02:10.830> that's

00:02:11.390 --> 00:02:11.400 
PVC pipe it's actually CPVC that's

00:02:11.400 --> 00:02:13.880 
PVC pipe it's actually CPVC that's
making<00:02:12.330> sure<00:02:12.540> that<00:02:12.780> the<00:02:13.020> integration<00:02:13.650> is<00:02:13.830> very

00:02:13.880 --> 00:02:13.890 
making sure that the integration is very

00:02:13.890 --> 00:02:16.250 
making sure that the integration is very
sturdy<00:02:14.370> and<00:02:14.490> it's<00:02:14.790> also<00:02:14.960> cleaning<00:02:15.960> it<00:02:16.050> up<00:02:16.110> a

00:02:16.250 --> 00:02:16.260 
sturdy and it's also cleaning it up a

00:02:16.260 --> 00:02:18.470 
sturdy and it's also cleaning it up a
little<00:02:16.440> bit<00:02:16.620> visually<00:02:17.130> I<00:02:17.340> integrated<00:02:18.270> the

00:02:18.470 --> 00:02:18.480 
little bit visually I integrated the

00:02:18.480 --> 00:02:20.780 
little bit visually I integrated the
cyclone<00:02:18.900> shock<00:02:19.170> instead<00:02:19.980> of<00:02:20.100> a<00:02:20.220> strong<00:02:20.580> arm

00:02:20.780 --> 00:02:20.790 
cyclone shock instead of a strong arm

00:02:20.790 --> 00:02:23.030 
cyclone shock instead of a strong arm
because<00:02:21.120> I<00:02:21.150> really<00:02:21.480> like<00:02:21.630> the<00:02:21.810> mega<00:02:22.020> mo<00:02:22.440> and<00:02:22.740> I

00:02:23.030 --> 00:02:23.040 
because I really like the mega mo and I

00:02:23.040 --> 00:02:25.370 
because I really like the mega mo and I
feel<00:02:23.700> like<00:02:23.910> if<00:02:24.090> you're<00:02:24.240> shooting<00:02:24.570> elite<00:02:25.170> darts

00:02:25.370 --> 00:02:25.380 
feel like if you're shooting elite darts

00:02:25.380 --> 00:02:27.500 
feel like if you're shooting elite darts
with<00:02:25.710> the<00:02:25.890> strife<00:02:26.280> that's<00:02:26.910> already<00:02:27.210> good

00:02:27.500 --> 00:02:27.510 
with the strife that's already good

00:02:27.510 --> 00:02:29.510 
with the strife that's already good
enough<00:02:27.540> and<00:02:28.050> the<00:02:28.320> strife<00:02:28.620> is<00:02:28.800> already<00:02:29.130> really

00:02:29.510 --> 00:02:29.520 
enough and the strife is already really

00:02:29.520 --> 00:02:31.580 
enough and the strife is already really
good<00:02:29.730> so<00:02:30.090> I<00:02:30.300> don't<00:02:30.690> feel<00:02:30.900> like<00:02:31.050> I<00:02:31.170> need<00:02:31.380> to<00:02:31.410> have

00:02:31.580 --> 00:02:31.590 
good so I don't feel like I need to have

00:02:31.590 --> 00:02:33.680 
good so I don't feel like I need to have
another<00:02:31.740> gun<00:02:32.160> that<00:02:32.370> shoots<00:02:32.700> elite<00:02:33.000> darts<00:02:33.210> so

00:02:33.680 --> 00:02:33.690 
another gun that shoots elite darts so

00:02:33.690 --> 00:02:35.300 
another gun that shoots elite darts so
I'd<00:02:33.870> rather<00:02:34.080> have<00:02:34.380> a<00:02:34.620> mega<00:02:34.920> darts<00:02:35.250> shooting

00:02:35.300 --> 00:02:35.310 
I'd rather have a mega darts shooting

00:02:35.310 --> 00:02:37.550 
I'd rather have a mega darts shooting
gun<00:02:35.700> I<00:02:35.940> also<00:02:36.420> did<00:02:36.750> this<00:02:36.900> because<00:02:37.200> I<00:02:37.290> had<00:02:37.380> never

00:02:37.550 --> 00:02:37.560 
gun I also did this because I had never

00:02:37.560 --> 00:02:40.100 
gun I also did this because I had never
seen<00:02:37.830> it<00:02:37.980> done<00:02:38.550> before<00:02:38.970> and<00:02:39.210> at<00:02:39.660> first<00:02:39.900> I

00:02:40.100 --> 00:02:40.110 
seen it done before and at first I

00:02:40.110 --> 00:02:41.720 
seen it done before and at first I
thought<00:02:40.140> the<00:02:40.470> cyclone<00:02:40.890> shock<00:02:41.160> was<00:02:41.400> going<00:02:41.610> to

00:02:41.720 --> 00:02:41.730 
thought the cyclone shock was going to

00:02:41.730 --> 00:02:43.910 
thought the cyclone shock was going to
be<00:02:41.850> really<00:02:42.780> big<00:02:42.990> and<00:02:43.290> it<00:02:43.350> was<00:02:43.470> going<00:02:43.560> to<00:02:43.650> be<00:02:43.740> way

00:02:43.910 --> 00:02:43.920 
be really big and it was going to be way

00:02:43.920 --> 00:02:46.130 
be really big and it was going to be way
too<00:02:43.950> big<00:02:44.280> to<00:02:44.310> integrate<00:02:44.820> underneath<00:02:45.330> but<00:02:45.930> it's

00:02:46.130 --> 00:02:46.140 
too big to integrate underneath but it's

00:02:46.140 --> 00:02:47.930 
too big to integrate underneath but it's
actually<00:02:46.680> not<00:02:46.860> that<00:02:46.920> bad<00:02:47.130> and<00:02:47.640> it<00:02:47.760> looks

00:02:47.930 --> 00:02:47.940 
actually not that bad and it looks

00:02:47.940 --> 00:02:49.790 
actually not that bad and it looks
pretty<00:02:48.180> good<00:02:48.300> it's<00:02:48.630> about<00:02:48.720> the<00:02:48.959> same<00:02:49.140> size<00:02:49.380> as

00:02:49.790 --> 00:02:49.800 
pretty good it's about the same size as

00:02:49.800 --> 00:02:52.880 
pretty good it's about the same size as
a<00:02:49.830> Magnus<00:02:50.580> integration<00:02:51.360> and<00:02:52.140> it<00:02:52.530> works<00:02:52.800> very

00:02:52.880 --> 00:02:52.890 
a Magnus integration and it works very

00:02:52.890 --> 00:02:54.680 
a Magnus integration and it works very
well<00:02:53.130> those<00:02:53.760> are<00:02:53.910> all<00:02:54.000> of<00:02:54.030> the<00:02:54.270> internal

00:02:54.680 --> 00:02:54.690 
well those are all of the internal

00:02:54.690 --> 00:02:56.330 
well those are all of the internal
modifications<00:02:55.470> so<00:02:55.650> now<00:02:55.800> I'll<00:02:55.920> go<00:02:56.040> over<00:02:56.130> the

00:02:56.330 --> 00:02:56.340 
modifications so now I'll go over the

00:02:56.340 --> 00:02:58.850 
modifications so now I'll go over the
paints<00:02:56.760> I<00:02:56.940> used<00:02:57.510> the<00:02:57.720> same<00:02:57.750> paints<00:02:58.350> as<00:02:58.500> coop

00:02:58.850 --> 00:02:58.860 
paints I used the same paints as coop

00:02:58.860 --> 00:03:01.370 
paints I used the same paints as coop
did<00:02:59.100> on<00:02:59.340> his<00:02:59.580> streamin<00:03:00.060> although<00:03:00.420> maybe<00:03:01.080> my

00:03:01.370 --> 00:03:01.380 
did on his streamin although maybe my

00:03:01.380 --> 00:03:02.900 
did on his streamin although maybe my
lighting<00:03:01.770> and<00:03:01.920> my<00:03:02.010> camera<00:03:02.400> a<00:03:02.490> little<00:03:02.730> bit

00:03:02.900 --> 00:03:02.910 
lighting and my camera a little bit

00:03:02.910 --> 00:03:04.970 
lighting and my camera a little bit
different<00:03:03.360> because<00:03:03.510> his<00:03:04.380> paints<00:03:04.740> look<00:03:04.890> a

00:03:04.970 --> 00:03:04.980 
different because his paints look a

00:03:04.980 --> 00:03:07.010 
different because his paints look a
little<00:03:05.100> bit<00:03:05.280> different<00:03:05.670> I<00:03:05.820> started<00:03:06.480> off<00:03:06.630> with

00:03:07.010 --> 00:03:07.020 
little bit different I started off with

00:03:07.020 --> 00:03:10.040 
little bit different I started off with
a<00:03:07.290> great<00:03:07.320> vinyl<00:03:08.010> die<00:03:08.160> primer<00:03:08.520> and<00:03:08.880> then<00:03:09.390> I<00:03:09.630> used

00:03:10.040 --> 00:03:10.050 
a great vinyl die primer and then I used

00:03:10.050 --> 00:03:13.940 
a great vinyl die primer and then I used
krylon<00:03:11.040> Sun<00:03:11.520> yellow<00:03:11.910> accents<00:03:12.510> and<00:03:12.930> I<00:03:13.650> have

00:03:13.940 --> 00:03:13.950 
krylon Sun yellow accents and I have

00:03:13.950 --> 00:03:16.850 
krylon Sun yellow accents and I have
lower<00:03:14.610> and<00:03:14.910> blue<00:03:15.090> from<00:03:15.300> Citadel<00:03:15.840> in<00:03:16.050> selective

00:03:16.850 --> 00:03:16.860 
lower and blue from Citadel in selective

00:03:16.860 --> 00:03:18.830 
lower and blue from Citadel in selective
places<00:03:17.280> like<00:03:17.459> on<00:03:17.640> the<00:03:17.790> barrel<00:03:18.090> and<00:03:18.330> the<00:03:18.600> nerf

00:03:18.830 --> 00:03:18.840 
places like on the barrel and the nerf

00:03:18.840 --> 00:03:19.580 
places like on the barrel and the nerf

00:03:19.590 --> 00:03:20.930

I<00:03:19.620> think<00:03:19.920> the<00:03:20.010> paint's<00:03:20.310> turned<00:03:20.550> out<00:03:20.700> really

00:03:20.930 --> 00:03:20.940 
I think the paint's turned out really

00:03:20.940 --> 00:03:23.690 
I think the paint's turned out really
nicely<00:03:21.209> and<00:03:21.660> I<00:03:22.320> can't<00:03:22.709> take<00:03:22.950> credit<00:03:23.220> for<00:03:23.580> this

00:03:23.690 --> 00:03:23.700 
nicely and I can't take credit for this

00:03:23.700 --> 00:03:25.790 
nicely and I can't take credit for this
color<00:03:23.940> combination<00:03:24.300> obviously<00:03:25.230> because<00:03:25.530> I

00:03:25.790 --> 00:03:25.800 
color combination obviously because I

00:03:25.800 --> 00:03:28.699 
color combination obviously because I
replicated<00:03:26.790> what<00:03:27.000> someone<00:03:27.420> did<00:03:27.540> exactly<00:03:28.019> but

00:03:28.699 --> 00:03:28.709 
replicated what someone did exactly but

00:03:28.709 --> 00:03:32.570 
replicated what someone did exactly but
I<00:03:29.120> think<00:03:30.120> it<00:03:30.239> is<00:03:30.390> very<00:03:30.870> cool<00:03:31.200> film<00:03:31.560> so<00:03:32.340> now<00:03:32.519> that

00:03:32.570 --> 00:03:32.580 
I think it is very cool film so now that

00:03:32.580 --> 00:03:34.009 
I think it is very cool film so now that
I've<00:03:32.820> won<00:03:32.850> over<00:03:33.090> everything<00:03:33.540> like

00:03:34.009 --> 00:03:34.019 
I've won over everything like

00:03:34.019 --> 00:03:36.380 
I've won over everything like
modifications<00:03:34.920> and<00:03:35.070> paints<00:03:35.550> let's<00:03:35.970> go<00:03:36.120> to<00:03:36.180> the

00:03:36.380 --> 00:03:36.390 
modifications and paints let's go to the

00:03:36.390 --> 00:03:58.270 
modifications and paints let's go to the
firing<00:03:36.660> devil

00:03:58.270 --> 00:03:58.280 

00:03:58.280 --> 00:04:00.580
