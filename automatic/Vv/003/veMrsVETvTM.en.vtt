00:00:11.929 --> 00:00:34.710
 I'm here with those back to 

00:00:15.360 --> 00:00:41.160
 amazon magazine who already touches and goes 

00:00:34.710 --> 00:00:42.719
 trying something is a good thing 

00:00:41.160 --> 00:00:51.030
 Basic I think it will be easy to 

00:00:42.719 --> 00:00:53.730
 sure you will play drums today 

00:00:51.030 --> 00:01:34.979
 first thing is actually a way 

00:00:53.730 --> 00:01:37.700
 well continues but you are only looking 

00:01:34.979 --> 00:01:37.700
 fast 

00:01:55.890 --> 00:02:25.650
 still suitable for playing drums 

00:02:09.220 --> 00:02:29.950
 It's okay today, it 's better than 

00:02:25.650 --> 00:02:43.090
 important is always with you, you 

00:02:29.950 --> 00:02:45.190
 mentaliza as exercises well ok, you can 

00:02:43.090 --> 00:02:47.380
 complicate what is simple is the only 

00:02:45.190 --> 00:02:51.600
 you put two notes each time in 

00:02:47.380 --> 00:02:51.600
 right hand and you'll get it here O 

00:02:55.060 --> 00:03:10.930
 hence we are opposed to what the 

00:03:08.890 --> 00:03:15.030
 people can not talk that you do not touch 

00:03:10.930 --> 00:03:15.030
 Drums you're playing drums 

00:03:16.650 --> 00:03:24.280
 nothing that you study type 40 50 minutes 

00:03:21.519 --> 00:03:27.269
 per day in 10 days you're playing 

00:03:24.280 --> 00:03:27.269
 a basic song 

00:03:40.900 --> 00:03:48.610
 I think the song especially today 

00:03:45.400 --> 00:03:51.310
 in the day she became a profession as 

00:03:48.610 --> 00:03:53.019
 any other specialty 

00:03:51.310 --> 00:03:55.150
 If you want to be a doctor, it's not enough. 

00:03:53.019 --> 00:03:58.379
 have a diploma only have to specialize 

00:03:55.150 --> 00:04:01.000
 in something really study always 

00:03:58.379 --> 00:04:03.310
 lawyers or is a profession like 

00:04:01.000 --> 00:04:05.650
 Do you really want to have a bacteria? 

00:04:03.310 --> 00:04:08.170
 Featured today has to be a guy 

00:04:05.650 --> 00:04:10.569
 who is always practicing and always 

00:04:08.170 --> 00:04:13.379
 we think of renewing within what we 

00:04:10.569 --> 00:04:13.379
 you japan 

00:04:22.430 --> 00:04:26.720
 there are people who play very well 

00:04:25.009 --> 00:04:27.620
 know how to do some things in a way 

00:04:26.720 --> 00:04:29.449
 only 

00:04:27.620 --> 00:04:32.509
 but they have no idea how to go 

00:04:29.449 --> 00:04:34.669
 This understood and I started to do class 

00:04:32.509 --> 00:04:38.539
 It's too late, I started taking classes with 

00:04:34.669 --> 00:04:39.949
 22 years understood today there are lots of 

00:04:38.539 --> 00:04:42.770
 people playing with 22 years 

00:04:39.949 --> 00:04:45.229
 professionally the information that 

00:04:42.770 --> 00:04:47.330
 there are nowadays with the internet are 

00:04:45.229 --> 00:04:50.210
 much larger at the time I started to 

00:04:47.330 --> 00:04:53.000
 to play at that time you had 

00:04:50.210 --> 00:04:55.520
 a vhs possibly the people who go 

00:04:53.000 --> 00:04:59.229
 watch this problem does not know you have 

00:04:55.520 --> 00:04:59.229
 a tape of vhs a tape cassette 

00:05:01.910 --> 00:05:08.060
 but ball then ask you a time 

00:05:05.540 --> 00:05:12.040
 I had to listen to the songs on tapes. 

00:05:08.060 --> 00:05:12.040
 recordings of lps on walkman 

00:05:20.270 --> 00:05:24.770
 today all mail 

00:05:22.580 --> 00:05:27.350
 free on the net 

00:05:24.770 --> 00:05:29.870
 So I think this is good and it's bad. 

00:05:27.350 --> 00:05:31.940
 when one has access to it all and 

00:05:29.870 --> 00:05:34.490
 she knows that analyzing what is good for 

00:05:31.940 --> 00:05:36.320
 she's great in my day 

00:05:34.490 --> 00:05:42.650
 When you had there was even one 

00:05:36.320 --> 00:05:49.340
 video lesson is a source of information that 

00:05:42.650 --> 00:05:51.640
 No one can say that you've never touched 

00:05:49.340 --> 00:05:54.410
 battery that you go with two measures 

00:05:51.640 --> 00:05:57.610
 perfectly and I'll train there I will 

00:05:54.410 --> 00:05:57.610
 show the video for you 

00:05:59.170 --> 00:06:05.210
 For the time being I thought nothing came out. 

00:06:01.550 --> 00:06:08.120
 in the Amazon fell yes to record here you 

00:06:05.210 --> 00:06:10.990
 you can use the recordings to 

00:06:08.120 --> 00:06:10.990
 perfect one more 

00:06:17.270 --> 00:06:26.540
 Thank you, it's a pleasure to be here. 

00:06:20.370 --> 00:06:26.540
