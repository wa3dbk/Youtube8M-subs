again<00:01:19.409> I<00:01:19.439> just<00:01:19.590> kept<00:01:19.920> it<00:01:20.040> very<00:01:20.159> close<00:01:20.490> to<00:01:20.640> the

00:01:20.690 --> 00:01:20.700 
again I just kept it very close to the

00:01:20.700 --> 00:01:22.880 
again I just kept it very close to the
lash<00:01:20.880> line<00:01:20.909> try<00:01:21.810> to<00:01:21.869> take<00:01:22.560> a<00:01:22.590> little<00:01:22.740> longer

00:01:34.470 --> 00:01:37.190 
decided to only apply the mascara to the
top<00:01:34.590> lids<00:01:35.369> because<00:01:35.640> tailors<00:01:36.600> look<00:01:36.780> from<00:01:37.020> what

00:01:37.190 --> 00:01:37.200
