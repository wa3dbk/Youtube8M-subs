sesame oil on there and then I like a

00:01:07.860 --> 00:01:12.969 
sesame oil on there and then I like a
good<00:01:08.220> amount<00:01:08.520> of<00:01:09.409> fresh<00:01:10.760> cracked<00:01:11.760> pepper<00:01:11.939> I

00:01:12.969 --> 00:01:12.979 
good amount of fresh cracked pepper I

00:01:12.979 --> 00:01:16.249 
good amount of fresh cracked pepper I
like<00:01:13.979> a<00:01:14.010> really<00:01:14.250> good<00:01:14.430> amount<00:01:14.700> on<00:01:14.790> there<00:01:15.140> and<00:01:16.140> I

00:01:16.249 --> 00:01:16.259 
like a really good amount on there and I

00:01:16.259 --> 00:01:18.050 
like a really good amount on there and I
like<00:01:16.409> a<00:01:16.439> good<00:01:16.860> amount<00:01:17.070> of<00:01:17.220> salt<00:01:17.490> on<00:01:17.729> there<00:01:17.880> too

like a good amount of salt on there too

00:01:18.060 --> 00:01:20.060 
like a good amount of salt on there too
I<00:01:18.270> think<00:01:18.930> if<00:01:19.049> you<00:01:19.140> salt<00:01:19.409> in<00:01:19.560> the<00:01:19.650> beginning

00:01:20.060 --> 00:01:20.070 
I think if you salt in the beginning

00:01:20.070 --> 00:01:22.429 
I think if you salt in the beginning
part<00:01:20.100> you<00:01:20.700> can<00:01:20.850> salt<00:01:21.450> less<00:01:21.659> at<00:01:21.840> the<00:01:21.900> very<00:01:22.170> end

00:01:22.429 --> 00:01:22.439 
part you can salt less at the very end

00:01:22.439 --> 00:01:26.390 
part you can salt less at the very end
and<00:01:22.710> that<00:01:22.770> way<00:01:23.360> people<00:01:24.360> have<00:01:25.100> you<00:01:26.100> know<00:01:26.159> good

00:01:26.390 --> 00:01:26.400 
and that way people have you know good

00:01:26.400 --> 00:01:29.330 
and that way people have you know good
flavor<00:01:26.729> but<00:01:27.240> not<00:01:27.360> too<00:01:27.540> salty<00:01:27.780> on<00:01:28.049> there<00:01:28.340> we're

00:01:29.330 --> 00:01:29.340 
flavor but not too salty on there we're

00:01:29.340 --> 00:01:31.910 
flavor but not too salty on there we're
going<00:01:29.460> to<00:01:29.549> finish<00:01:29.759> these<00:01:30.060> ones<00:01:30.299> up<00:01:30.619> my<00:01:31.619> grill
