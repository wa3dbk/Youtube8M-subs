00:01:47.380 --> 00:01:47.390 
the top decks of a format dictate what

00:01:47.390 --> 00:01:48.940 
the top decks of a format dictate what

to set a digit armor you know I already

00:02:28.040 --> 00:02:30.490 
to set a digit armor you know I already
thought<00:02:28.370> that<00:02:28.580> fire<00:02:28.820> offense<00:02:29.150> 3<00:02:29.600> x's<00:02:29.990> and<00:02:30.140> 4

00:02:30.490 --> 00:02:30.500 
thought that fire offense 3 x's and 4

00:02:30.500 --> 00:02:32.320 
thought that fire offense 3 x's and 4
axis<00:02:30.890> we're<00:02:31.160> going<00:02:31.400> to<00:02:31.550> be<00:02:31.640> a<00:02:31.670> high<00:02:31.910> tier<00:02:32.150> deck

00:02:32.320 --> 00:02:32.330 
axis we're going to be a high tier deck

00:02:32.330 --> 00:02:34.180 
axis we're going to be a high tier deck
of<00:02:32.450> the<00:02:32.510> format<00:02:32.930> so<00:02:33.410> it<00:02:33.530> really<00:02:33.740> just<00:02:33.830> shows

00:02:34.180 --> 00:02:34.190 
of the format so it really just shows

00:02:34.190 --> 00:02:36.190 
of the format so it really just shows
you<00:02:34.460> I<00:02:34.760> mean<00:02:34.940> anything<00:02:35.390> can<00:02:35.750> kind<00:02:35.990> of<00:02:36.050> win

00:02:36.190 --> 00:02:36.200 
you I mean anything can kind of win

00:02:36.200 --> 00:02:38.590 
you I mean anything can kind of win
right<00:02:36.350> now<00:02:36.530> I<00:02:36.830> don't<00:02:37.160> feel<00:02:37.460> like<00:02:37.760> there<00:02:38.000> is<00:02:38.030> a

00:02:38.590 --> 00:02:38.600 
right now I don't feel like there is a

00:02:38.600 --> 00:02:41.800 
right now I don't feel like there is a
dominant<00:02:38.930> debt<00:02:39.440> so<00:02:39.860> when<00:02:40.850> you<00:02:41.000> are<00:02:41.060> maxing<00:02:41.690> out

00:02:41.800 --> 00:02:41.810 
dominant debt so when you are maxing out

00:02:41.810 --> 00:02:43.300 
dominant debt so when you are maxing out
on<00:02:42.110> hand<00:02:42.320> traps<00:02:42.560> especially<00:02:43.040> if<00:02:43.130> you're

00:02:43.300 --> 00:02:43.310 
on hand traps especially if you're

00:02:43.310 --> 00:02:45.580 
on hand traps especially if you're
contemplating<00:02:44.000> running<00:02:44.510> like<00:02:44.810> throughout

00:02:45.580 --> 00:02:45.590 
contemplating running like throughout

00:02:45.590 --> 00:02:48.610 
contemplating running like throughout
five<00:02:46.100> or<00:02:46.580> four<00:02:46.910> spots<00:02:47.270> I<00:02:47.630> just<00:02:47.870> think<00:02:48.080> like<00:02:48.170> I

00:02:48.610 --> 00:02:48.620 
five or four spots I just think like I

00:02:48.620 --> 00:02:51.160 
five or four spots I just think like I
mean<00:02:48.860> it's<00:02:49.070> a<00:02:49.250> serious<00:02:49.550> liability<00:02:50.050> you<00:02:51.050> know

00:02:51.160 --> 00:02:51.170 
mean it's a serious liability you know

00:02:51.170 --> 00:02:53.410 
mean it's a serious liability you know
don't<00:02:51.410> get<00:02:51.530> me<00:02:51.590> wrong<00:02:51.920> cards<00:02:52.490> like<00:02:52.640> Maxie<00:02:53.180> and

00:02:53.410 --> 00:02:53.420 
don't get me wrong cards like Maxie and

00:02:53.420 --> 00:02:55.300 
don't get me wrong cards like Maxie and
Baylor<00:02:53.840> are<00:02:54.020> still<00:02:54.230> good<00:02:54.500> in<00:02:54.650> fact<00:02:54.860> I<00:02:55.010> still

00:02:55.300 --> 00:02:55.310 
Baylor are still good in fact I still
