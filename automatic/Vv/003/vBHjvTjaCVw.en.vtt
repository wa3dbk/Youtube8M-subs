 invitation 

00:01:06.050 --> 00:01:09.290
 The agreement only seeks karate and not another theme 

00:01:09.290 --> 00:01:11.210
 singer for together the solutions 

00:01:11.210 --> 00:01:13.390

00:01:15.890 --> 00:01:17.300
 politely 

00:01:17.300 --> 00:01:20.610
 respect education study is part of the character 

00:01:20.610 --> 00:01:23.610
 I believe he is stimulated by both the party itself 

00:01:24.360 --> 00:01:26.380
 learning. 

00:01:26.380 --> 00:01:27.329

00:01:30.480 --> 00:01:33.000
 she has an attraction this is an Olympic fight 

00:01:33.000 --> 00:01:33.880
 ef 

00:01:33.880 --> 00:01:35.039
 I think by the voice 

00:01:35.039 --> 00:01:36.450
 use of force 

00:01:36.450 --> 00:01:40.460
 r other activities almost went until iran suffers new mutum

 helped danielle angry placed where we chose the dollar to practice 

00:01:45.840 --> 00:01:48.840
 the main point is the philosophy did not help have a philosophy 

00:01:49.390 --> 00:01:54.229
 and will say that it is of disciplines that are the basic precepts of many 

00:01:54.229 --> 00:01:58.650
 and I think it's part of most of them so I guess 

00:01:58.650 --> 00:02:02.510
 that discipline is paramount and also because they were the debtor parties wanted 

00:02:02.510 --> 00:02:06.700
 and if there was her husband was of her lost the concierge did not want to depend 

00:02:06.700 --> 00:02:10.460
 no one the physical and mental trainer finds necessary 

00:02:10.460 --> 00:02:13.550
 trained the Brazilian team of taekwondo that competed in the Olympiad 

00:02:13.550 --> 00:02:14.879
 said 

00:02:14.879 --> 00:02:20.709
 what speaks about the benefits of this modality the change of attitude is a 

00:02:20.709 --> 00:02:22.450
 very important course for 

00:02:22.450 --> 00:02:24.919
 the preparation of a person 

00:02:24.919 --> 00:02:28.219
 provided that it is guided by a professional education 

00:02:28.219 --> 00:02:31.519
 physics often interesting even as I have monitoring 

00:02:31.519 --> 00:02:34.349
 multidisciplinary team of other professionals in the field of health and education 

00:02:34.349 --> 00:02:39.169
 some of these modalities are part of the life of colleges 

00:02:39.169 --> 00:02:42.409
 this is important for future physical education professionals 

00:02:43.709 --> 00:02:46.379
 I have contact with martial arts. 

00:02:46.379 --> 00:02:50.819
 many have a different view of what to teach 

00:02:50.819 --> 00:02:52.369
 learn to fight 

00:02:52.369 --> 00:02:57.559
 in any crowded city always linked to self-defense, competition is bad 

00:02:57.559 --> 00:02:59.859
 tell the truth is that the right attitude 

00:02:59.859 --> 00:03:02.379
 but we have a very large collection 

00:03:02.379 --> 00:03:06.790
 physically exploited within the fruits and martial arts that can be 

00:03:06.790 --> 00:03:07.819
 used 

00:03:07.819 --> 00:03:12.169
 the advice of the school physical couple to practice any of these 

00:03:12.169 --> 00:03:15.169
 activities is fundamental to choose a good professional 

00:03:15.919 --> 00:03:19.129
 wait for what mode every day is better then
