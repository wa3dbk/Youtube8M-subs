that<00:02:47.220> she<00:02:47.370> got<00:02:47.550> with<00:02:47.700> a<00:02:47.730> lot<00:02:47.970> of<00:02:48.000> the<00:02:48.150> 1982

00:02:48.740 --> 00:02:48.750 
that she got with a lot of the 1982

00:02:48.750 --> 00:02:52.820 
that she got with a lot of the 1982
figures<00:02:49.290> which<00:02:50.280> has<00:02:50.489> ear<00:02:51.150> holes<00:02:51.450> as<00:02:51.690> well<00:02:51.840> for

00:02:52.820 --> 00:02:52.830 
figures which has ear holes as well for

00:02:52.830 --> 00:02:55.400 
figures which has ear holes as well for
the<00:02:52.920> headset<00:02:53.569> what<00:02:54.569> ear<00:02:54.750> holes<00:02:54.959> were<00:02:55.140> also

00:02:55.400 --> 00:02:55.410 
the headset what ear holes were also

00:02:55.410 --> 00:02:59.300 
the headset what ear holes were also
kind<00:02:55.590> of<00:02:56.030> standard<00:02:57.030> whether<00:02:57.569> the<00:02:58.160> helmets<00:02:59.160> had

00:02:59.300 --> 00:02:59.310 
kind of standard whether the helmets had

00:02:59.310 --> 00:03:01.160 
kind of standard whether the helmets had
anything<00:02:59.670> to<00:02:59.790> attach<00:03:00.060> to<00:03:00.330> them<00:03:00.480> or<00:03:00.629> not<00:03:00.840> back

00:03:01.160 --> 00:03:01.170 
anything to attach to them or not back

00:03:01.170 --> 00:03:05.660 
anything to attach to them or not back
then<00:03:03.739> now<00:03:04.739> there<00:03:04.920> were<00:03:05.010> actually<00:03:05.400> several

00:03:05.660 --> 00:03:05.670 
then now there were actually several

00:03:05.670 --> 00:03:07.759 
then now there were actually several
differences<00:03:06.239> between<00:03:06.569> the<00:03:07.079> 1980<00:03:07.560> two

00:03:07.759 --> 00:03:07.769 
differences between the 1980 two

00:03:07.769 --> 00:03:09.770 
differences between the 1980 two
versions<00:03:08.310> of<00:03:08.430> the<00:03:08.579> figures<00:03:08.910> under<00:03:09.269> 1983

00:03:09.770 --> 00:03:09.780

00:03:13.739 --> 00:03:16.400 
versions 1983 version of breaker like
allow<00:03:13.950> the<00:03:14.010> car<00:03:14.579> figures<00:03:14.940> was<00:03:15.120> also<00:03:15.540> reissued

00:03:16.400 --> 00:03:16.410 
allow the car figures was also reissued

00:03:16.410 --> 00:03:21.500 
allow the car figures was also reissued
in<00:03:16.560> 1984<00:03:17.280> as<00:03:17.489> well<00:03:18.440> but<00:03:19.440> besides<00:03:19.950> the<00:03:20.510> much

00:03:21.500 --> 00:03:21.510 
in 1984 as well but besides the much

00:03:21.510 --> 00:03:23.660 
in 1984 as well but besides the much
larger<00:03:21.780> waist<00:03:22.290> on<00:03:22.500> the<00:03:22.620> eighty<00:03:22.829> two<00:03:23.099> versions

00:03:23.660 --> 00:03:23.670 
larger waist on the eighty two versions

00:03:23.670 --> 00:03:25.759 
larger waist on the eighty two versions
of<00:03:23.879> course<00:03:24.329> these<00:03:24.540> versions<00:03:24.780> are<00:03:25.079> considered

00:03:25.759 --> 00:03:25.769 
of course these versions are considered

00:03:25.769 --> 00:03:28.039 
of course these versions are considered
swivel<00:03:26.579> arm<00:03:26.730> battle<00:03:27.209> draft<00:03:27.450> versions<00:03:27.900> and

00:03:28.039 --> 00:03:28.049 
swivel arm battle draft versions and

00:03:28.049 --> 00:03:31.000 
swivel arm battle draft versions and
that's<00:03:28.170> because<00:03:28.500> of<00:03:28.650> the<00:03:28.739> arm<00:03:28.890> construction

00:03:31.000 --> 00:03:31.010 
that's because of the arm construction

00:03:31.010 --> 00:03:33.400 
that's because of the arm construction
when<00:03:32.010> they're<00:03:32.160> first<00:03:32.400> released<00:03:32.700> in<00:03:32.849> 1982

00:03:33.400 --> 00:03:33.410 
when they're first released in 1982

00:03:33.410 --> 00:03:36.550 
when they're first released in 1982
while<00:03:34.410> they<00:03:34.620> could<00:03:34.950> bend<00:03:35.610> at<00:03:35.790> the<00:03:35.910> shoulders

00:03:36.550 --> 00:03:36.560 
while they could bend at the shoulders

00:03:36.560 --> 00:03:39.949 
while they could bend at the shoulders
and<00:03:37.560> not<00:03:37.709> the<00:03:37.889> elbows<00:03:38.420> they<00:03:39.420> didn't<00:03:39.690> have<00:03:39.810> any

00:03:39.949 --> 00:03:39.959 
and not the elbows they didn't have any

00:03:39.959 --> 00:03:42.289 
and not the elbows they didn't have any
bicep<00:03:40.530> articulation<00:03:41.310> so<00:03:41.549> it<00:03:41.639> was<00:03:41.819> really<00:03:42.030> hard

00:03:42.289 --> 00:03:42.299 
bicep articulation so it was really hard

00:03:42.299 --> 00:03:44.990 
bicep articulation so it was really hard
from<00:03:42.480> two<00:03:42.810> whole<00:03:43.560> weapons<00:03:44.549> and<00:03:44.730> accessories

00:03:44.990 --> 00:03:45.000 
from two whole weapons and accessories

00:03:45.000 --> 00:03:47.300 
from two whole weapons and accessories
that<00:03:45.480> two-handed<00:03:46.410> grip<00:03:46.650> which<00:03:46.920> is<00:03:47.069> kind<00:03:47.280> of

00:03:47.300 --> 00:03:47.310 
that two-handed grip which is kind of

00:03:47.310 --> 00:03:51.289 
that two-handed grip which is kind of
more<00:03:47.489> natural<00:03:49.519> so<00:03:50.519> then<00:03:50.730> they<00:03:50.880> made<00:03:51.090> these

00:03:51.289 --> 00:03:51.299 
more natural so then they made these

00:03:51.299 --> 00:03:54.020 
more natural so then they made these
four<00:03:51.599> figures<00:03:52.250> which<00:03:53.250> did<00:03:53.459> the<00:03:53.549> same<00:03:53.730> thing

00:03:54.020 --> 00:03:54.030 
four figures which did the same thing

00:03:54.030 --> 00:03:55.910 
four figures which did the same thing
bent<00:03:54.420> at<00:03:54.630> the<00:03:54.660> elbow<00:03:54.780> and<00:03:55.290> the<00:03:55.410> shoulder<00:03:55.440> and

00:03:55.910 --> 00:03:55.920 
bent at the elbow and the shoulder and

00:03:55.920 --> 00:03:59.240 
bent at the elbow and the shoulder and
all<00:03:56.040> that<00:03:56.220> but<00:03:56.430> had<00:03:56.639> this<00:03:57.889> articulation<00:03:58.889> point

00:03:59.240 --> 00:03:59.250 
all that but had this articulation point

00:03:59.250 --> 00:04:01.580 
all that but had this articulation point
at<00:03:59.370> the<00:03:59.489> bicep<00:03:59.970> which<00:04:00.750> allowed<00:04:01.019> them<00:04:01.170> to<00:04:01.230> cross

00:04:01.580 --> 00:04:01.590 
at the bicep which allowed them to cross

00:04:01.590 --> 00:04:03.620 
at the bicep which allowed them to cross
their<00:04:01.859> arms<00:04:01.889> and<00:04:02.340> you<00:04:02.639> know<00:04:02.700> hold<00:04:03.209> things<00:04:03.389> to

00:04:03.620 --> 00:04:03.630 
their arms and you know hold things to

00:04:03.630 --> 00:04:06.729 
their arms and you know hold things to
handedly<00:04:04.549> so<00:04:05.549> that<00:04:05.669> was<00:04:05.819> the<00:04:05.940> second<00:04:06.329> thing

00:04:06.729 --> 00:04:06.739 
handedly so that was the second thing

00:04:06.739 --> 00:04:09.949 
handedly so that was the second thing
but<00:04:07.739> the<00:04:07.829> third<00:04:08.040> thing<00:04:08.069> is<00:04:08.459> that<00:04:08.669> oddly<00:04:09.660> enough

00:04:09.949 --> 00:04:09.959 
but the third thing is that oddly enough

00:04:09.959 --> 00:04:12.819 
but the third thing is that oddly enough
they<00:04:10.739> actually<00:04:11.430> changed<00:04:11.910> the<00:04:12.030> mold<00:04:12.269> of<00:04:12.450> the

00:04:12.819 --> 00:04:12.829 
they actually changed the mold of the

00:04:12.829 --> 00:04:17.960 
they actually changed the mold of the
back<00:04:13.829> chest<00:04:14.299> so<00:04:15.299> so<00:04:16.109> the<00:04:16.709> whole<00:04:16.979> which<00:04:17.789> is

00:04:17.960 --> 00:04:17.970 
back chest so so the whole which is

00:04:17.970 --> 00:04:19.759 
back chest so so the whole which is
where<00:04:18.209> the<00:04:18.329> backpacks<00:04:18.840> usually<00:04:19.229> go<00:04:19.440> is

00:04:19.759 --> 00:04:19.769 
where the backpacks usually go is

00:04:19.769 --> 00:04:22.069 
where the backpacks usually go is
actually<00:04:20.310> a<00:04:20.370> bit<00:04:20.609> different<00:04:20.780> than<00:04:21.780> the<00:04:21.870> ones

00:04:22.069 --> 00:04:22.079 
actually a bit different than the ones

00:04:22.079 --> 00:04:24.409 
actually a bit different than the ones
of<00:04:22.229> the<00:04:22.289> 1982<00:04:22.770> version<00:04:23.370> and<00:04:23.550> thus<00:04:24.240> the

00:04:24.409 --> 00:04:24.419 
of the 1982 version and thus the

00:04:24.419 --> 00:04:27.620 
of the 1982 version and thus the
backpacks<00:04:24.990> often<00:04:25.440> had<00:04:25.620> different<00:04:26.360> styles<00:04:27.360> of

00:04:27.620 --> 00:04:27.630 
backpacks often had different styles of

00:04:27.630 --> 00:04:31.100 
backpacks often had different styles of
pegs<00:04:29.270> now<00:04:30.270> this<00:04:30.419> is<00:04:30.539> going<00:04:30.690> to<00:04:30.780> be<00:04:30.870> a<00:04:30.900> little

00:04:31.100 --> 00:04:31.110 
pegs now this is going to be a little

00:04:31.110 --> 00:04:32.990 
pegs now this is going to be a little
hard<00:04:31.440> to<00:04:31.500> to<00:04:31.919> demonstrate<00:04:32.099> because<00:04:32.820> this

00:04:32.990 --> 00:04:33.000 
hard to to demonstrate because this

00:04:33.000 --> 00:04:36.050 
hard to to demonstrate because this
again<00:04:33.510> is<00:04:33.660> you<00:04:34.050> know<00:04:34.139> in<00:04:34.500> the<00:04:34.620> package<00:04:35.039> but<00:04:35.940> the

00:04:36.050 --> 00:04:36.060 
again is you know in the package but the

00:04:36.060 --> 00:04:38.270 
again is you know in the package but the
1983<00:04:36.780> pegs<00:04:37.139> are<00:04:37.349> actually<00:04:37.680> kind<00:04:37.919> of<00:04:37.950> a<00:04:38.099> bit

00:04:38.270 --> 00:04:38.280 
1983 pegs are actually kind of a bit

00:04:38.280 --> 00:04:41.770 
1983 pegs are actually kind of a bit
longer<00:04:38.669> and<00:04:39.090> sort<00:04:40.050> of<00:04:40.110> rounded<00:04:40.620> at<00:04:40.740> the<00:04:40.770> ends

00:04:41.770 --> 00:04:41.780 
longer and sort of rounded at the ends

00:04:41.780 --> 00:04:44.810 
longer and sort of rounded at the ends
whereas<00:04:42.780> the<00:04:42.930> pegs<00:04:43.260> on<00:04:43.770> the<00:04:43.919> 82<00:04:44.099> versions<00:04:44.700> were

00:04:44.810 --> 00:04:44.820 
whereas the pegs on the 82 versions were

00:04:44.820 --> 00:04:47.210 
whereas the pegs on the 82 versions were
actually<00:04:45.150> a<00:04:45.210> bit<00:04:45.240> stubbier

00:04:47.210 --> 00:04:47.220 
actually a bit stubbier

00:04:47.220 --> 00:04:48.860 
actually a bit stubbier
my<00:04:47.490> fact<00:04:47.850> I<00:04:47.940> would<00:04:48.090> I<00:04:48.240> would<00:04:48.420> actually<00:04:48.720> call

00:04:48.860 --> 00:04:48.870 
my fact I would I would actually call

00:04:48.870 --> 00:04:51.070 
my fact I would I would actually call
that<00:04:48.900> maybe<00:04:49.530> like<00:04:49.740> a<00:04:49.770> quarter<00:04:50.490> of<00:04:50.520> an<00:04:50.730> inch

00:04:51.070 --> 00:04:51.080 
that maybe like a quarter of an inch

00:04:51.080 --> 00:04:53.360 
that maybe like a quarter of an inch
versus<00:04:52.080> the<00:04:52.200> eighty<00:04:52.350> three<00:04:52.740> versions<00:04:52.980> of<00:04:53.280> the

00:04:53.360 --> 00:04:53.370 
versus the eighty three versions of the

00:04:53.370 --> 00:04:58.030 
versus the eighty three versions of the
peg<00:04:53.550> which<00:04:53.760> were<00:04:54.120> more<00:04:54.480> like<00:04:54.630> a<00:04:54.660> half<00:04:55.050> an<00:04:55.230> inch
