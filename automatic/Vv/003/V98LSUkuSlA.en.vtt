00:00:20.640 --> 00:00:20.650 
you know try this set up you know you

00:00:20.650 --> 00:00:22.409 
you know try this set up you know you
know<00:00:20.769> maybe<00:00:20.949> that's<00:00:21.220> stupid<00:00:21.669> but<00:00:21.820> I<00:00:21.939> always<00:00:22.119> do

00:00:22.409 --> 00:00:22.419 
know maybe that's stupid but I always do

00:00:22.419 --> 00:00:24.109 
know maybe that's stupid but I always do
that<00:00:22.570> when<00:00:22.720> I<00:00:22.779> get<00:00:22.990> new<00:00:23.140> you<00:00:23.380> know<00:00:23.439> I<00:00:23.589> was<00:00:23.800> a

00:00:24.109 --> 00:00:24.119 
that when I get new you know I was a

00:00:24.119 --> 00:00:27.569 
that when I get new you know I was a
designer<00:00:25.320> let's<00:00:26.320> try<00:00:26.679> the<00:00:26.740> settings<00:00:27.279> a<00:00:27.400> day

00:00:27.569 --> 00:00:27.579 
designer let's try the settings a day

00:00:27.579 --> 00:00:29.189 
designer let's try the settings a day
that<00:00:27.820> they<00:00:27.970> suggest<00:00:28.449> and<00:00:28.689> they're<00:00:29.050> all<00:00:29.169> very

00:00:29.189 --> 00:00:29.199 
that they suggest and they're all very

00:00:29.199 --> 00:00:31.319 
that they suggest and they're all very
effective<00:00:29.859> I<00:00:29.949> mean<00:00:30.130> usually<00:00:30.640> they<00:00:30.970> fill<00:00:31.179> these

00:00:31.319 --> 00:00:31.329 
effective I mean usually they fill these

00:00:31.329 --> 00:00:32.729 
effective I mean usually they fill these
terms<00:00:31.570> around<00:00:31.720> and<00:00:32.050> you<00:00:32.110> kind<00:00:32.349> of<00:00:32.410> think<00:00:32.619> oh

00:00:32.729 --> 00:00:32.739 
terms around and you kind of think oh

00:00:32.739 --> 00:00:34.950 
terms around and you kind of think oh
you<00:00:32.920> know<00:00:32.980> right<00:00:33.280> but<00:00:33.910> these<00:00:34.120> actually<00:00:34.360> when

00:00:34.950 --> 00:00:34.960 
you know right but these actually when

00:00:34.960 --> 00:00:36.300 
you know right but these actually when
you<00:00:35.050> switch<00:00:35.260> them<00:00:35.380> they<00:00:35.530> actually<00:00:35.680> sort<00:00:36.070> of<00:00:36.160> do

00:00:36.300 --> 00:00:36.310 
you switch them they actually sort of do

00:00:36.310 --> 00:00:38.400 
you switch them they actually sort of do
that<00:00:36.520> you<00:00:37.360> know<00:00:37.480> it's<00:00:37.750> just<00:00:37.840> kind<00:00:38.050> of<00:00:38.170> unusual

00:00:38.400 --> 00:00:38.410 
that you know it's just kind of unusual

00:00:38.410 --> 00:00:41.850 
that you know it's just kind of unusual
in<00:00:38.770> an<00:00:38.890> amplifier<00:00:39.040> I<00:00:39.840> went<00:00:40.840> I<00:00:41.050> went<00:00:41.530> with<00:00:41.710> the

00:00:41.850 --> 00:00:41.860 
in an amplifier I went I went with the

00:00:41.860 --> 00:00:43.500 
in an amplifier I went I went with the
British<00:00:42.310> class<00:00:42.640> a<00:00:42.880> thinking<00:00:43.270> well<00:00:43.390> maybe

00:00:43.500 --> 00:00:43.510

00:01:19.649 --> 00:01:19.659 
real sound and reverb and this is quite

00:01:19.659 --> 00:01:21.960 
real sound and reverb and this is quite
a<00:01:19.780> good<00:01:19.930> spring<00:01:20.229> reverb<00:01:20.409> in<00:01:20.710> this<00:01:20.830> unit<00:01:21.220> quiet

00:01:21.960 --> 00:01:21.970 
a good spring reverb in this unit quiet

00:01:21.970 --> 00:01:26.190 
a good spring reverb in this unit quiet
and<00:01:22.710> and<00:01:23.710> and<00:01:24.520> and<00:01:24.880> very<00:01:25.090> natural<00:01:25.840> sounding

spring<00:01:26.470> reverb<00:01:26.649> real<00:01:27.100> good<00:01:27.340> unit<00:01:27.700> so<00:01:28.180> this<00:01:28.299> is

00:01:28.440 --> 00:01:28.450 
spring reverb real good unit so this is

00:01:28.450 --> 00:01:30.539 
spring reverb real good unit so this is
a<00:01:28.479> very<00:01:28.720> effective<00:01:29.020> reverb<00:01:29.500> of<00:01:29.680> in<00:01:30.130> terms<00:01:30.369> of
