 first do so with lebanon has a chance and meet you 

00:00:32.630 --> 00:00:34.000
 in euros shared the same 

00:00:34.000 --> 00:00:37.000
 same passion for drawing Flemish parties the comic 

00:00:37.570 --> 00:00:41.510
 so it necessarily brought us closer together and even more expensive if 

00:00:41.510 --> 00:00:42.690
 friendship 

00:00:42.690 --> 00:00:46.080
 to date without follow-up the genre is gone in another 

00:00:46.880 --> 00:00:48.210
 that's what makes 

00:00:48.210 --> 00:00:49.970
 we lost our sight 

00:00:49.970 --> 00:00:53.420
 everyone is making his little journey to see continue to tell 

00:00:53.420 --> 00:00:55.310
 to work at the machined 

00:00:55.310 --> 00:00:57.710
 and for no further 

00:00:57.710 --> 00:01:02.220
 sunday took place after my baccalaureate left a heterogeneous institution 

00:01:04.400 --> 00:01:07.400
 forging a school with a comic section 

00:01:10.370 --> 00:01:12.420
 in the 2nd year of 

00:01:12.420 --> 00:01:15.860
 judicial angoulÃªme present 

00:01:15.860 --> 00:01:17.400
 teheran fire 

00:01:17.400 --> 00:01:19.270
 the investigator action in cash 

00:01:19.270 --> 00:01:22.740
 and on that I saw that I had to win the angry part 

00:01:23.670 --> 00:01:25.930
 so 

00:01:25.930 --> 00:01:28.580
 which made me think it would be nice to contact him again 

00:01:28.580 --> 00:01:31.100
 with 8% 

00:01:31.100 --> 00:01:34.369
 the world to specify the causes that it will accept so you can 

00:01:34.369 --> 00:01:36.780
 very singing 

00:01:36.780 --> 00:01:40.600
 on vacation in France sometime after I contacted france review 

00:01:40.600 --> 00:01:42.830
 lancet shows a little what you have to the other 

00:01:42.830 --> 00:01:46.520
 and so I spoke long this famous and collabos of Saturday 

00:01:47.270 --> 00:01:49.610
 and percent 

00:01:49.610 --> 00:01:53.600
 and so on that I finally define it so his studies 

00:01:53.600 --> 00:01:56.840
 create the sound tray in pocket and the water rises carbon cers 

00:01:56.840 --> 00:02:00.420
 other creed he did clamoring his first year in front of me I was doing 

00:02:00.420 --> 00:02:01.570
 my third 

00:02:01.570 --> 00:02:03.440
 despite this we were allowed to 

00:02:03.440 --> 00:02:06.340
 to participate in a graduation project in form 

00:02:06.340 --> 00:02:09.069
 since every year was a year ago 

00:02:09.069 --> 00:02:10.439
 a personal project that 

00:02:10.439 --> 00:02:13.439
 what must be done, he noted by a jury of professionals 

00:02:14.219 --> 00:02:17.849
 and so offer our project we had the high commissioner jury orders 

00:02:18.579 --> 00:02:21.909
 and a nice blink and that's where he saw our work 

00:02:23.589 --> 00:02:25.819
 some time later and we continued 

00:02:25.819 --> 00:02:28.739
 once the bottom of the nets as for me I finished my uncle my schooling 

00:02:28.739 --> 00:02:32.239
 kind of stopped for them finally we will continue to work together 

00:02:33.539 --> 00:02:36.809
 and on it the few months after she has not even 

00:02:36.809 --> 00:02:39.879
 go ahead a bit on the project and in Arabic 

00:02:39.879 --> 00:02:41.549
 nico contact islert 

00:02:41.549 --> 00:02:44.760
 to ask him a little what he thought of the evolution of the project 

00:02:44.760 --> 00:02:46.529
 to the extent that he had seen the bear 

00:02:46.529 --> 00:02:47.899
 they want buses 

00:02:47.899 --> 00:02:49.979
 and if turkey has offered us in the world 

00:02:49.979 --> 00:02:52.979
 to work on them this famous project of the war of sambre 

00:02:57.609 --> 00:02:59.099
 it is believed 

00:02:59.099 --> 00:03:02.269
 I am very influenced the passport 

00:03:02.269 --> 00:03:03.569
 referee m 

00:03:03.569 --> 00:03:06.529
 see this obviously no 

00:03:06.529 --> 00:03:09.529
 their big return 

00:03:10.599 --> 00:03:13.179
 it's okay it's still a lot of nonsense 

00:03:13.179 --> 00:03:16.950
 it's his budget to have made it realistic enough 

00:03:16.950 --> 00:03:19.269
 but as against ac milan 

00:03:19.269 --> 00:03:22.269
 the vase if you want to live 

00:03:22.999 --> 00:03:27.669
 so the story after having a good traffic record -6 9 goals influence in 

00:03:27.669 --> 00:03:30.019
 the halong bay is really got a lot of tension around 

00:03:30.019 --> 00:03:31.910
 drawing painting 

00:03:31.910 --> 00:03:34.910
 a full report 

00:03:35.599 --> 00:03:37.679
 jessica parker 

00:03:37.679 --> 00:03:41.040
 if we take five months we are also interested in being 100% 

00:03:41.040 --> 00:03:43.809
 what was done and their birth 

00:03:43.809 --> 00:03:45.289
 hundreds wounded 

00:03:45.289 --> 00:03:47.569
 in question by the Italian press 

00:03:47.569 --> 00:03:50.779
 it's still different from what it's possible that people in the 

00:03:50.779 --> 00:03:53.129
 comic 

00:03:53.129 --> 00:03:55.609
 November 30 

00:03:55.609 --> 00:03:57.469
 your role will be good at arras 

00:03:57.469 --> 00:03:58.729
 shower r 

00:03:58.729 --> 00:04:02.999
 the band had% sequel so by training them with the back of their rights 

00:04:04.979 --> 00:04:08.999
 the ecocities label therefore risks that this meaning is very much in a universe of 

00:04:08.999 --> 00:04:09.799
 information
