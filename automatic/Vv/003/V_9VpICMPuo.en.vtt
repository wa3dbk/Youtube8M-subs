citizens can make a decent living off
the<00:00:59.600> land<00:00:59.629> then<00:01:00.530> they<00:01:00.739> can<00:01:00.920> start<00:01:01.160> regaining

00:01:02.110 --> 00:01:02.120 
the land then they can start regaining

00:01:02.120 --> 00:01:04.869 
the land then they can start regaining
confidence<00:01:02.690> in<00:01:03.170> themselves<00:01:03.379> and<00:01:03.890> they<00:01:04.430> start

00:01:04.869 --> 00:01:04.879 
confidence in themselves and they start

00:01:04.879 --> 00:01:07.060 
confidence in themselves and they start
thinking<00:01:05.210> of<00:01:05.660> what<00:01:05.869> is<00:01:06.050> good<00:01:06.290> what<00:01:06.860> is<00:01:06.920> bad
