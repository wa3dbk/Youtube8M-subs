over top of wedge and again I'm just
using<00:02:35.020> light<00:02:35.440> buffing<00:02:35.830> motions<00:02:36.190> to

00:02:36.390 --> 00:02:36.400 
using light buffing motions to

00:02:36.400 --> 00:02:37.830 
using light buffing motions to
distribute<00:02:36.850> the<00:02:36.970> color<00:02:37.120> and<00:02:37.450> blend<00:02:37.690> it

properly next I'm going in with nooner

00:02:43.420 --> 00:02:46.200 
properly next I'm going in with nooner
and<00:02:43.630> this<00:02:44.620> is<00:02:44.800> a<00:02:44.980> cooler<00:02:45.550> sort<00:02:45.910> of<00:02:46.000> more

00:02:46.200 --> 00:02:46.210 
and this is a cooler sort of more

focusing<00:02:51.610> this<00:02:51.790> more<00:02:52.150> so<00:02:52.360> in<00:02:52.540> the<00:02:52.570> crease<00:02:52.990> than

00:02:53.430 --> 00:02:53.440 
focusing this more so in the crease than

00:02:53.440 --> 00:02:55.260 
focusing this more so in the crease than
on<00:02:53.590> the<00:02:53.710> brow<00:02:53.860> bone<00:02:53.920> just<00:02:54.520> blending<00:02:55.060> in<00:02:55.150> an

00:02:58.470 --> 00:02:58.480 
outer V motion this is going to be the

00:02:58.480 --> 00:03:01.020 
outer V motion this is going to be the
primary<00:02:58.960> color<00:02:59.380> that<00:02:59.650> I<00:02:59.680> use<00:03:00.010> for<00:03:00.490> deepening

00:03:01.020 --> 00:03:01.030 
primary color that I use for deepening

00:03:01.030 --> 00:03:05.130

and<00:03:01.380> defining<00:03:02.380> that<00:03:02.590> crease<00:03:02.920> area<00:03:03.870> going<00:03:04.870> in

00:03:05.130 --> 00:03:05.140 
and defining that crease area going in

00:03:05.140 --> 00:03:07.110 
and defining that crease area going in
with<00:03:05.350> the<00:03:05.470> brush<00:03:05.740> that<00:03:05.800> comes<00:03:06.400> with<00:03:06.610> the<00:03:06.820> Naked

with the brush that comes with the Naked
3<00:03:07.150> palette<00:03:07.360> I'm<00:03:07.810> using<00:03:08.050> the<00:03:08.320> wider<00:03:08.650> end<00:03:08.980> to

00:03:09.840 --> 00:03:09.850 
3 palette I'm using the wider end to

00:03:09.850 --> 00:03:15.300 
3 palette I'm using the wider end to
accentuate<00:03:10.480> the<00:03:10.780> crease<00:03:11.020> a<00:03:11.050> little<00:03:11.410> more

00:03:15.300 --> 00:03:15.310 

00:03:15.310 --> 00:03:19.000 

and<00:03:16.630> then<00:03:17.630> I'm<00:03:17.900> going<00:03:18.290> back<00:03:18.500> in<00:03:18.770> with<00:03:18.800> that

00:03:19.000 --> 00:03:19.010 
and then I'm going back in with that

00:03:19.010 --> 00:03:21.820 
and then I'm going back in with that
Sigma<00:03:19.819> e25<00:03:20.090> blending<00:03:20.660> brush<00:03:21.080> to<00:03:21.319> diffuse<00:03:21.709> the

Sigma e25 blending brush to diffuse the

00:03:21.830 --> 00:03:25.000 
Sigma e25 blending brush to diffuse the
color<00:03:22.330> this<00:03:23.330> look<00:03:23.630> is<00:03:23.810> a<00:03:23.840> lot<00:03:24.230> of<00:03:24.470> slowly

00:03:25.000 --> 00:03:25.010 
color this look is a lot of slowly

00:03:25.010 --> 00:03:26.740 
color this look is a lot of slowly
building<00:03:25.520> up<00:03:25.670> the<00:03:25.760> color<00:03:25.970> and<00:03:26.240> then<00:03:26.390> blending

00:03:26.740 --> 00:03:26.750 
building up the color and then blending

00:03:26.750 --> 00:03:28.600 
building up the color and then blending
it<00:03:26.840> out<00:03:26.959> this<00:03:27.650> just<00:03:27.920> helps<00:03:28.010> give<00:03:28.310> it<00:03:28.340> the

00:03:28.600 --> 00:03:28.610 
it out this just helps give it the

00:03:28.610 --> 00:03:34.230 
it out this just helps give it the
softest<00:03:29.270> most<00:03:29.300> diffused<00:03:29.959> look<00:03:30.170> possible

00:03:34.230 --> 00:03:34.240 

00:03:34.240 --> 00:03:36.960 

then<00:03:35.020> again<00:03:35.350> going<00:03:35.620> in<00:03:35.740> with<00:03:35.890> that<00:03:36.010> a<00:03:36.220> 25<00:03:36.550> brush

00:03:36.960 --> 00:03:36.970 
then again going in with that a 25 brush

00:03:36.970 --> 00:03:38.790 
then again going in with that a 25 brush
and<00:03:37.240> a<00:03:37.360> little<00:03:37.600> bit<00:03:37.720> more<00:03:37.900> of<00:03:38.080> nooner<00:03:38.440> I<00:03:38.650> am

00:03:38.790 --> 00:03:38.800 
and a little bit more of nooner I am

00:03:38.800 --> 00:03:40.800 
and a little bit more of nooner I am
going<00:03:39.130> to<00:03:39.250> further<00:03:39.640> define<00:03:40.150> and<00:03:40.480> blend<00:03:40.690> the

going to further define and blend the
crease<00:03:42.720> now<00:03:43.720> I'm<00:03:44.050> taking<00:03:44.500> a<00:03:44.620> smaller<00:03:45.190> more

00:03:45.690 --> 00:03:45.700 
crease now I'm taking a smaller more

00:03:45.700 --> 00:03:47.810 
crease now I'm taking a smaller more
pointed<00:03:46.240> dome-shaped<00:03:46.630> crease<00:03:47.170> brush<00:03:47.440> and

00:03:47.810 --> 00:03:47.820 
pointed dome-shaped crease brush and

00:03:47.820 --> 00:03:51.060 
pointed dome-shaped crease brush and
this<00:03:48.820> is<00:03:49.000> going<00:03:49.240> to<00:03:49.480> further<00:03:50.290> define<00:03:50.890> the

00:03:51.060 --> 00:03:51.070 
this is going to further define the

00:03:51.070 --> 00:03:52.380 
this is going to further define the
crease<00:03:51.280> and<00:03:51.610> give<00:03:51.730> it<00:03:51.820> a<00:03:51.850> little<00:03:52.000> bit<00:03:52.180> more

00:03:52.380 --> 00:03:52.390 
crease and give it a little bit more

00:03:52.390 --> 00:03:55.110 
crease and give it a little bit more
depth<00:03:52.860> this<00:03:53.860> brush<00:03:54.130> is<00:03:54.310> great<00:03:54.580> for<00:03:54.790> applying

00:03:55.110 --> 00:03:55.120 
depth this brush is great for applying

00:03:55.120 --> 00:03:57.630 
depth this brush is great for applying
color<00:03:55.420> but<00:03:56.140> it<00:03:56.380> does<00:03:56.650> need<00:03:56.890> to<00:03:56.920> be<00:03:57.040> blended<00:03:57.460> so

00:03:57.630 --> 00:03:57.640 
color but it does need to be blended so

00:03:57.640 --> 00:03:59.310 
color but it does need to be blended so

00:05:18.540 --> 00:05:18.550 
lash line as possible and then I slowly
