00:02:28.400 --> 00:02:32.170 
I'm sitting on the car you would think
my<00:02:28.550> hand<00:02:28.820> should<00:02:29.450> be<00:02:29.480> up<00:02:29.630> here<00:02:30.520> but<00:02:31.520> this<00:02:31.790> is<00:02:32.030> at

00:02:32.170 --> 00:02:32.180 
my hand should be up here but this is at

00:02:32.180 --> 00:02:36.280 
my hand should be up here but this is at
least<00:02:33.010> four<00:02:34.010> or<00:02:34.130> five<00:02:34.310> inches<00:02:34.580> lower<00:02:35.060> so<00:02:35.570> it's

00:02:36.280 --> 00:02:36.290 
least four or five inches lower so it's

00:02:36.290 --> 00:02:38.560 
least four or five inches lower so it's
not<00:02:36.410> a<00:02:36.470> comfortable<00:02:36.800> position<00:02:37.370> it's<00:02:38.000> hard<00:02:38.330> for

00:02:38.560 --> 00:02:38.570 
not a comfortable position it's hard for

00:02:38.570 --> 00:02:42.400 
not a comfortable position it's hard for
me<00:02:38.690> to<00:02:40.270> it's<00:02:41.270> not<00:02:41.360> a<00:02:41.420> comfortable<00:02:41.630> position<00:02:42.380> to

00:02:42.400 --> 00:02:42.410 
me to it's not a comfortable position to

00:02:42.410 --> 00:02:48.150 
me to it's not a comfortable position to
be<00:02:43.390> putting<00:02:44.390> your<00:02:44.650> on<00:02:45.650> this<00:02:45.890> rest

00:02:48.150 --> 00:02:48.160 
be putting your on this rest

00:02:48.160 --> 00:02:50.950 
be putting your on this rest
that's<00:02:49.160> one<00:02:49.430> real<00:02:49.820> bummer<00:02:50.150> the<00:02:50.630> second

00:02:50.950 --> 00:02:50.960 
that's one real bummer the second

00:02:50.960 --> 00:02:52.780 
that's one real bummer the second
problem<00:02:51.170> with<00:02:51.440> this<00:02:51.590> armrest<00:02:51.920> is<00:02:52.280> that<00:02:52.520> this

00:02:52.780 --> 00:02:52.790 
problem with this armrest is that this

00:02:52.790 --> 00:02:55.270 
problem with this armrest is that this
cut<00:02:53.030> out<00:02:53.350> they<00:02:54.350> cut<00:02:54.560> this<00:02:54.710> out<00:02:54.860> for<00:02:55.160> this

00:02:55.270 --> 00:02:55.280 
cut out they cut this out for this

00:02:55.280 --> 00:02:57.370 
cut out they cut this out for this
handbrake<00:02:56.030> but<00:02:56.390> clearly<00:02:56.660> they<00:02:57.020> could<00:02:57.260> have

00:02:57.370 --> 00:02:57.380 
handbrake but clearly they could have

00:02:57.380 --> 00:03:01.570 
handbrake but clearly they could have
easily<00:02:58.270> made<00:02:59.270> a<00:02:59.300> big<00:03:00.200> square<00:03:00.740> and<00:03:01.070> still<00:03:01.430> it

00:03:01.570 --> 00:03:01.580 
easily made a big square and still it

00:03:01.580 --> 00:03:04.960 
easily made a big square and still it
would<00:03:01.730> work<00:03:02.000> I<00:03:02.360> don't<00:03:02.690> see<00:03:03.250> why<00:03:04.250> they<00:03:04.610> have<00:03:04.790> to

00:03:04.960 --> 00:03:04.970 
would work I don't see why they have to

00:03:04.970 --> 00:03:08.290 
would work I don't see why they have to
cut<00:03:05.150> this<00:03:05.270> out<00:03:05.450> but<00:03:05.870> on<00:03:06.140> on<00:03:06.860> the<00:03:07.490> bad<00:03:07.700> side<00:03:08.090> you

00:03:08.290 --> 00:03:08.300 
cut this out but on on the bad side you

00:03:08.300 --> 00:03:10.200 
cut this out but on on the bad side you
put<00:03:08.480> your<00:03:08.630> arm<00:03:08.810> this<00:03:09.020> is<00:03:09.080> where<00:03:09.320> your<00:03:09.470> arm<00:03:09.650> is

00:03:10.200 --> 00:03:10.210 
put your arm this is where your arm is

00:03:10.210 --> 00:03:13.930 
put your arm this is where your arm is
