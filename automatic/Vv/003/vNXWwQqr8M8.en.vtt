for<00:00:19.830> the<00:00:19.890> STG<00:00:20.400> 44<00:00:20.670> by<00:00:21.210> looking<00:00:21.480> at<00:00:21.539> this<00:00:21.630> at

00:00:21.769 --> 00:00:21.779 
for the STG 44 by looking at this at

00:00:21.779 --> 00:00:23.330 
for the STG 44 by looking at this at
first<00:00:21.960> glance<00:00:22.230> it<00:00:22.680> doesn't<00:00:22.949> look<00:00:23.039> like<00:00:23.189> it

00:00:23.330 --> 00:00:23.340 
first glance it doesn't look like it

00:00:23.340 --> 00:00:24.650 
first glance it doesn't look like it
would<00:00:23.400> be<00:00:23.490> a<00:00:23.519> very<00:00:23.580> good<00:00:23.820> gun<00:00:24.180> because<00:00:24.390> it<00:00:24.510> only

00:00:24.650 --> 00:00:24.660 
would be a very good gun because it only

00:00:24.660 --> 00:00:26.689 
would be a very good gun because it only
has<00:00:24.869> three<00:00:25.230> things<00:00:25.529> done<00:00:25.800> and<00:00:25.980> changed<00:00:26.550> the

00:00:26.689 --> 00:00:26.699 
has three things done and changed the

00:00:26.699 --> 00:00:29.330 
has three things done and changed the
actual<00:00:27.000> base<00:00:27.180> bearing<00:00:27.630> of<00:00:27.750> the<00:00:27.840> SPG<00:00:28.320> 44<00:00:28.830> but<00:00:29.250> if

00:00:29.330 --> 00:00:29.340 
actual base bearing of the SPG 44 but if

00:00:29.340 --> 00:00:30.859 
actual base bearing of the SPG 44 but if
you<00:00:29.400> actually<00:00:29.490> look<00:00:29.699> in-depth<00:00:30.240> more<00:00:30.510> into<00:00:30.779> the

00:00:30.859 --> 00:00:30.869 
you actually look in-depth more into the

00:00:30.869 --> 00:00:32.630 
you actually look in-depth more into the
gun<00:00:31.050> because<00:00:31.410> the<00:00:31.560> stats<00:00:31.800> lie<00:00:32.070> and<00:00:32.340> you<00:00:32.399> can

00:00:32.630 --> 00:00:32.640 
gun because the stats lie and you can

00:00:32.640 --> 00:00:33.860 
gun because the stats lie and you can
actually<00:00:32.880> find<00:00:33.059> out<00:00:33.270> what<00:00:33.420> it<00:00:33.510> actually<00:00:33.660> does

00:00:33.860 --> 00:00:33.870 
actually find out what it actually does

00:00:33.870 --> 00:00:35.990 
actually find out what it actually does
it<00:00:34.410> is<00:00:34.559> possibly<00:00:34.980> one<00:00:35.130> of<00:00:35.190> the<00:00:35.280> best<00:00:35.399> guns<00:00:35.880> in

00:00:35.990 --> 00:00:36.000 
it is possibly one of the best guns in

00:00:36.000 --> 00:00:37.729 
it is possibly one of the best guns in
call<00:00:36.180> duty<00:00:36.360> advanced<00:00:36.630> warfare<00:00:36.719> so<00:00:37.380> before<00:00:37.649> we

00:00:37.729 --> 00:00:37.739 
call duty advanced warfare so before we

00:00:37.739 --> 00:00:39.020 
call duty advanced warfare so before we
get<00:00:37.829> into<00:00:38.010> many<00:00:38.160> more<00:00:38.309> reasons<00:00:38.520> as<00:00:38.820> to<00:00:38.910> why

00:00:39.020 --> 00:00:39.030 
get into many more reasons as to why

00:00:39.030 --> 00:00:40.880 
get into many more reasons as to why
this<00:00:39.180> might<00:00:39.329> be<00:00:39.600> the<00:00:39.719> new<00:00:39.870> bow<00:00:40.110> or<00:00:40.410> the<00:00:40.530> new<00:00:40.649> gun

00:00:40.880 --> 00:00:40.890 
this might be the new bow or the new gun

00:00:40.890 --> 00:00:42.799 
this might be the new bow or the new gun
in<00:00:41.100> the<00:00:41.190> game<00:00:41.309> that<00:00:41.550> is<00:00:41.640> dominant<00:00:42.090> I<00:00:42.239> will<00:00:42.600> say

00:00:42.799 --> 00:00:42.809 
in the game that is dominant I will say

00:00:42.809 --> 00:00:44.150 
in the game that is dominant I will say
first<00:00:43.079> of<00:00:43.170> all<00:00:43.290> I'm<00:00:43.500> not<00:00:43.559> looking<00:00:43.950> enough<00:00:44.070> to

00:00:44.150 --> 00:00:44.160 
first of all I'm not looking enough to

00:00:44.160 --> 00:00:45.979 
first of all I'm not looking enough to
get<00:00:44.309> this<00:00:44.399> because<00:00:44.640> I'm<00:00:44.760> a<00:00:44.789> ps4<00:00:45.149> players<00:00:45.660> so<00:00:45.960> I

even by looking at the cameras on the

00:00:59.910 --> 00:01:01.340 
even by looking at the cameras on the
gun<00:01:00.059> like<00:01:00.210> the<00:01:00.329> x-ray<00:01:00.719> camera<00:01:00.960> I've<00:01:01.140> seen<00:01:01.320> a

00:01:01.340 --> 00:01:01.350 
gun like the x-ray camera I've seen a

00:01:01.350 --> 00:01:02.900 
gun like the x-ray camera I've seen a
lot<00:01:01.440> of<00:01:01.559> game<00:01:01.770> playoff<00:01:02.010> and<00:01:02.370> other<00:01:02.520> cameras

00:01:02.900 --> 00:01:02.910 
lot of game playoff and other cameras

00:01:02.910 --> 00:01:04.820 
lot of game playoff and other cameras
and<00:01:03.149> the<00:01:03.180> royalty<00:01:03.690> version<00:01:04.049> it<00:01:04.229> makes<00:01:04.530> the<00:01:04.710> gun

00:01:04.820 --> 00:01:04.830 
and the royalty version it makes the gun

00:01:04.830 --> 00:01:06.020 
and the royalty version it makes the gun
look<00:01:05.010> totally<00:01:05.250> different<00:01:05.580> but<00:01:05.760> it<00:01:05.880> actually

00:01:06.020 --> 00:01:06.030 
look totally different but it actually

00:01:06.030 --> 00:01:07.550 
look totally different but it actually
performs<00:01:06.689> totally<00:01:07.049> different<00:01:07.350> than<00:01:07.500> the

00:01:07.550 --> 00:01:07.560 
performs totally different than the

00:01:07.560 --> 00:01:09.020 
performs totally different than the
warning<00:01:07.799> world<00:01:07.950> at<00:01:08.100> war<00:01:08.250> as<00:01:08.400> well<00:01:08.610> and<00:01:08.850> this

00:01:09.020 --> 00:01:09.030 
warning world at war as well and this

00:01:09.030 --> 00:01:10.490 
warning world at war as well and this
change<00:01:09.180> in<00:01:09.330> performance<00:01:09.420> between<00:01:09.840> these<00:01:10.290> two

00:01:10.490 --> 00:01:10.500 
change in performance between these two

00:01:10.500 --> 00:01:11.750 
change in performance between these two
guns<00:01:10.770> on<00:01:10.890> the<00:01:10.950> different<00:01:11.250> games<00:01:11.460> applies

00:01:13.429 --> 00:01:13.439 
especially between the legendary variant

00:01:13.439 --> 00:01:15.020 
especially between the legendary variant
of<00:01:13.530> the<00:01:13.650> gun<00:01:13.799> and<00:01:13.979> the<00:01:14.130> warm<00:01:14.369> between<00:01:14.700> world<00:01:14.909> of

00:01:15.020 --> 00:01:15.030

war as well it was the good in world at
war<00:01:16.830> it<00:01:16.979> was<00:01:17.040> kinda<00:01:17.310> like<00:01:17.400> a<00:01:17.430> high-power<00:01:17.970> slow

00:01:18.560 --> 00:01:18.570 
war it was kinda like a high-power slow

00:01:18.570 --> 00:01:20.030 
war it was kinda like a high-power slow
fire<00:01:18.840> a<00:01:18.869> weapon<00:01:19.170> because<00:01:19.409> obviously<00:01:19.710> you're

00:01:20.030 --> 00:01:20.040 
fire a weapon because obviously you're

00:01:29.060 --> 00:01:29.070 
this could possibly be the new dominant

00:01:29.070 --> 00:01:30.679 
this could possibly be the new dominant
gun<00:01:29.250> in<00:01:29.340> advanced<00:01:29.610> warfare<00:01:30.030> especially<00:01:30.570> the

legendary variant of the STG 45 you can
see<00:01:32.700> on<00:01:32.790> the<00:01:32.880> screen<00:01:32.970> right<00:01:33.210> now<00:01:33.270> is<00:01:33.600> because

00:01:33.980 --> 00:01:33.990 
see on the screen right now is because

00:01:33.990 --> 00:01:35.330 
see on the screen right now is because
of<00:01:34.229> that<00:01:34.320> plus<00:01:34.470> won't<00:01:34.710> fire<00:01:34.920> it<00:01:35.100> and<00:01:35.250> it

00:01:35.330 --> 00:01:35.340 
of that plus won't fire it and it

00:01:35.340 --> 00:01:36.980 
of that plus won't fire it and it
actually<00:01:35.460> is<00:01:35.759> noticeable<00:01:36.390> and<00:01:36.540> the<00:01:36.720> reason

00:01:36.980 --> 00:01:36.990 
actually is noticeable and the reason

00:01:36.990 --> 00:01:38.179 
actually is noticeable and the reason
I'm<00:01:37.079> saying<00:01:37.229> that<00:01:37.380> is<00:01:37.530> because<00:01:37.560> on<00:01:37.920> the<00:01:38.040> other

00:01:38.179 --> 00:01:38.189 
I'm saying that is because on the other

00:01:38.189 --> 00:01:39.800 
I'm saying that is because on the other
assault<00:01:38.490> rifle<00:01:38.790> that<00:01:38.880> has<00:01:38.939> plus<00:01:39.299> one<00:01:39.509> in<00:01:39.600> fire

assault rifle that has plus one in fire
it<00:01:40.020> that's<00:01:40.170> not<00:01:40.320> really<00:01:40.560> meant<00:01:40.770> to<00:01:40.860> is<00:01:41.070> the

00:01:41.149 --> 00:01:41.159 
it that's not really meant to is the

00:01:41.159 --> 00:01:42.889 
it that's not really meant to is the

00:01:44.389 --> 00:01:44.399 
Hong console doesn't really make that

00:01:44.399 --> 00:01:46.190 
Hong console doesn't really make that
noticeable<00:01:44.790> on<00:01:45.000> console<00:01:45.479> as<00:01:45.630> far<00:01:45.930> as<00:01:46.020> I'm

00:01:46.190 --> 00:01:46.200 
noticeable on console as far as I'm

00:01:46.200 --> 00:01:48.679 
noticeable on console as far as I'm
aware<00:01:46.229> but<00:01:46.649> the<00:01:46.979> STG<00:01:47.369> 44<00:01:47.640> it<00:01:48.240> actually<00:01:48.390> makes

00:01:48.679 --> 00:01:48.689 
aware but the STG 44 it actually makes

00:01:48.689 --> 00:01:50.749

the<00:01:48.780> fire<00:01:49.020> rate<00:01:49.200> the<00:01:49.320> same<00:01:49.500> as<00:01:49.619> the<00:01:49.770> bowel<00:01:50.009> 27th

00:01:50.749 --> 00:01:50.759 
the fire rate the same as the bowel 27th

00:01:50.759 --> 00:01:52.639 
the fire rate the same as the bowel 27th
heir<00:01:50.939> Spencer<00:01:51.600> the<00:01:51.930> rounds<00:01:52.229> per<00:01:52.380> minute<00:01:52.500> for

seven rounds per minute the second

00:01:57.810 --> 00:01:59.060 
seven rounds per minute the second
reason<00:01:57.899> why<00:01:58.170> this<00:01:58.229> could<00:01:58.560> possibly<00:01:58.710> be<00:01:58.950> the

00:01:59.060 --> 00:01:59.070 
reason why this could possibly be the

00:01:59.070 --> 00:02:00.620 
reason why this could possibly be the
new<00:01:59.280> vessel<00:01:59.700> in<00:01:59.790> advanced<00:02:00.060> warfare<00:02:00.509> is

new vessel in advanced warfare is

00:02:00.630 --> 00:02:02.539 
new vessel in advanced warfare is

because it has that nice built-in plus

00:02:02.549 --> 00:02:04.039 
because it has that nice built-in plus
one<00:02:02.729> accuracy<00:02:03.240> and<00:02:03.360> this<00:02:03.509> gun<00:02:03.659> has<00:02:03.689> a<00:02:03.840> lot<00:02:04.020> of

kick<00:02:04.350> as<00:02:04.649> far<00:02:04.920> as<00:02:05.009> I'm<00:02:05.159> aware<00:02:05.189> because<00:02:05.549> of

00:02:05.749 --> 00:02:05.759 
kick as far as I'm aware because of

00:02:05.759 --> 00:02:07.580 
kick as far as I'm aware because of
seeing<00:02:05.969> gameplay<00:02:06.390> and<00:02:06.630> wow<00:02:06.810> this<00:02:07.259> thing<00:02:07.439> kicks
