video we tested the screen strength on
the<00:00:20.220> new<00:00:20.400> iPhone<00:00:20.970> 6<00:00:21.359> and<00:00:21.630> compared<00:00:22.199> it<00:00:22.260> to<00:00:22.320> its

00:00:22.490 --> 00:00:22.500 
the new iPhone 6 and compared it to its

predecessors in our tests the screen on
the<00:00:24.930> iPhone<00:00:25.289> 6<00:00:25.619> took<00:00:25.890> far<00:00:26.130> less<00:00:26.310> force<00:00:26.580> to

00:00:26.750 --> 00:00:26.760 
the iPhone 6 took far less force to

00:00:26.760 --> 00:00:28.279 
the iPhone 6 took far less force to
break<00:00:26.970> than<00:00:27.269> that<00:00:27.449> of<00:00:27.570> its<00:00:27.689> older<00:00:27.930> brothers

00:00:28.279 --> 00:00:28.289 
break than that of its older brothers

00:00:28.289 --> 00:00:30.710 
break than that of its older brothers
that<00:00:29.039> got<00:00:29.220> us<00:00:29.369> wondering<00:00:29.640> what<00:00:30.330> does<00:00:30.390> it<00:00:30.539> take

00:00:30.710 --> 00:00:30.720 
that got us wondering what does it take

than<00:01:13.170> we<00:01:13.290> thought<00:01:13.370> with<00:01:14.370> the<00:01:14.460> extreme

00:01:14.810 --> 00:01:14.820 
than we thought with the extreme

00:01:14.820 --> 00:01:16.220 
than we thought with the extreme
pressure<00:01:14.970> that<00:01:15.330> we're<00:01:15.450> using<00:01:15.600> to<00:01:15.810> propel<00:01:16.110> the

durability issues in some instances the

00:01:21.210 --> 00:01:22.880 
durability issues in some instances the
dart<00:01:21.450> would<00:01:21.600> just<00:01:21.750> blow<00:01:21.930> itself<00:01:22.200> apart<00:01:22.560> upon

exiting<00:01:23.310> the<00:01:23.430> barrel<00:01:23.610> the<00:01:24.420> answer<00:01:24.660> to<00:01:24.780> both<00:01:24.900> of

00:01:25.070 --> 00:01:25.080 
exiting the barrel the answer to both of

00:01:25.080 --> 00:01:26.690 
exiting the barrel the answer to both of
these<00:01:25.170> problems<00:01:25.710> is<00:01:25.890> to<00:01:25.920> increase<00:01:26.400> dart

00:01:26.690 --> 00:01:26.700 
these problems is to increase dart

00:01:26.700 --> 00:01:29.000 
these problems is to increase dart
rigidity<00:01:27.180> and<00:01:27.210> mass<00:01:27.570> to<00:01:28.200> accomplish<00:01:28.620> this<00:01:28.770> we

00:01:29.000 --> 00:01:29.010 
rigidity and mass to accomplish this we

00:01:29.010 --> 00:01:31.430 
rigidity and mass to accomplish this we
surgically<00:01:29.460> enhanced<00:01:29.640> our<00:01:30.060> dart<00:01:30.330> we<00:01:30.990> injected

00:01:31.430 --> 00:01:31.440 
surgically enhanced our dart we injected

00:01:31.440 --> 00:01:33.260 
surgically enhanced our dart we injected
hot<00:01:31.620> glue<00:01:31.860> into<00:01:32.040> tip<00:01:32.280> to<00:01:32.460> make<00:01:32.580> it<00:01:32.700> solid<00:01:33.150> and

00:01:33.260 --> 00:01:33.270 
hot glue into tip to make it solid and

00:01:33.270 --> 00:01:35.090 
hot glue into tip to make it solid and
then<00:01:33.780> put<00:01:33.990> a<00:01:34.020> dowel<00:01:34.260> rod<00:01:34.470> down<00:01:34.680> the<00:01:34.800> center<00:01:35.040> of

then put a dowel rod down the center of
the<00:01:35.220> dart<00:01:35.460> to<00:01:35.610> make<00:01:35.730> it<00:01:35.850> extremely<00:01:36.270> rigid<00:01:36.600> as

00:01:37.490 --> 00:01:37.500 
the dart to make it extremely rigid as

00:01:37.500 --> 00:01:39.170 
the dart to make it extremely rigid as
you'll<00:01:37.710> see<00:01:37.830> in<00:01:37.920> the<00:01:38.010> footage<00:01:38.190> that<00:01:38.640> did<00:01:39.090> the
