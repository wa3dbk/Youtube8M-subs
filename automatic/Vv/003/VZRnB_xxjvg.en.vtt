00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.049
 hello I greet you to the tasty tuesday 

00:00:02.310 --> 00:00:06.089
 Today I have a video maybe 

00:00:04.049 --> 00:00:08.090
 her but a little bit nonsense is I 

00:00:06.089 --> 00:00:11.130
 I said that I too straight to 

00:00:08.090 --> 00:00:13.710
 to make a few smaller videos 

00:00:11.130 --> 00:00:15.660
 just shows that I eat like that and that 

00:00:13.710 --> 00:00:17.340
 Today's video that's not her now 

00:00:15.660 --> 00:00:19.740
 as a recipe idea actually thought 

00:00:17.340 --> 00:00:22.170
 not at all I had that 

00:00:19.740 --> 00:00:23.910
 recorded the same day as me one 

00:00:22.170 --> 00:00:25.800
 Of course, crazy ones at all 

00:00:23.910 --> 00:00:26.880
 nothing left in the fridge so me 

00:00:25.800 --> 00:00:28.830
 I had to watch that with a few 

00:00:26.880 --> 00:00:30.269
 few things together 

00:00:28.830 --> 00:00:32.969
 I got that too 

00:00:30.269 --> 00:00:36.360
 very good as I think only I have 

00:00:32.969 --> 00:00:38.879
 something legal with something completely not 

00:00:36.360 --> 00:00:42.390
 vegan accordingly that you see after that so 

00:00:38.879 --> 00:00:44.100
 that's why it may not be for 

00:00:42.390 --> 00:00:44.969
 many are doing but for me it went 

00:00:44.100 --> 00:00:47.789
 only to the amount 

00:00:44.969 --> 00:00:49.739
 so in the amount of what I hold 

00:00:47.789 --> 00:00:51.690
 just so that I just stop one 

00:00:49.739 --> 00:00:55.770
 get breakfast together and that's why 

00:00:51.690 --> 00:00:58.230
 yes I show that actually so completely 

00:00:55.770 --> 00:01:01.109
 exciting find what people like theirs 

00:00:58.230 --> 00:01:04.470
 fridge with your leftovers so sour 

00:01:01.109 --> 00:01:06.210
 that this little short video 

00:01:04.470 --> 00:01:06.720
 interested then you just stay 

00:01:06.210 --> 00:01:08.760
 tuned 

00:01:06.720 --> 00:01:11.250
 we watch us first that here so 

00:01:08.760 --> 00:01:12.510
 I had just one now 

00:01:11.250 --> 00:01:14.760
 at home I would have me 

00:01:12.510 --> 00:01:16.770
 probably made and fried 

00:01:14.760 --> 00:01:21.180
 but i saw it in the fridge 

00:01:16.770 --> 00:01:23.490
 that I still have a quarter tofu 

00:01:21.180 --> 00:01:25.470
 so to speak in the fridge and there 

00:01:23.490 --> 00:01:28.020
 I thought, what am I going to do with it now? 

00:01:25.470 --> 00:01:30.119
 because he really is not two weeks anymore 

00:01:28.020 --> 00:01:32.070
 at home and I just thought so 

00:01:30.119 --> 00:01:35.119
 I could that it theoretically so 

00:01:32.070 --> 00:01:39.000
 from the consistency to a scrambled egg 

00:01:35.119 --> 00:01:41.899
 virtually work with the scrambled eggs 

00:01:39.000 --> 00:01:43.710
 mix together so I have now 

00:01:41.899 --> 00:01:45.780
 speck cube with pure so the turn 

00:01:43.710 --> 00:01:48.240
 now one or the other think 

00:01:45.780 --> 00:01:50.820
 why use depot and skin then still 

00:01:48.240 --> 00:01:52.619
 speck cube purely so the reason why 

00:01:50.820 --> 00:01:54.740
 i had tofu at all that i am 

00:01:52.619 --> 00:01:58.829
 Just wanted to try it 

00:01:54.740 --> 00:01:59.730
 to a lasagne or for a lasagne 

00:01:58.829 --> 00:02:01.710
 used 

00:01:59.730 --> 00:02:03.420
 and as a substitute for minced meat and 

00:02:01.710 --> 00:02:05.820
 By the way, I can highly recommend that 

00:02:03.420 --> 00:02:07.260
 not really that delicious 

00:02:05.820 --> 00:02:08.190
 no meat I just wanted to go 

00:02:07.260 --> 00:02:10.680
 try how it tastes bitter 

00:02:08.190 --> 00:02:11.910
 tastes really good and 

00:02:10.680 --> 00:02:14.460
 Now I had just the gate where 

00:02:11.910 --> 00:02:15.690
 By the way, just mixed down here 

00:02:14.460 --> 00:02:19.470
 and that's a bit like that 

00:02:15.690 --> 00:02:22.290
 loya sauce mixed so to that 

00:02:19.470 --> 00:02:25.110
 Now some curry dead then 

00:02:22.290 --> 00:02:26.910
 I still have salt and pepper 

00:02:25.110 --> 00:02:29.460
 mixed and yes that's what I have 

00:02:26.910 --> 00:02:31.920
 normal little milk 

00:02:29.460 --> 00:02:35.550
 mixed and also spiced 

00:02:31.920 --> 00:02:37.050
 I first stewed and afterwards 

00:02:35.550 --> 00:02:39.030
 then the egg and then added 

00:02:37.050 --> 00:02:42.360
 did it come out and me 

00:02:39.030 --> 00:02:45.410
 think that really looks like one 

00:02:42.360 --> 00:02:47.520
 scrambled eggs then now continue with 

00:02:45.410 --> 00:02:49.020
 I also had quark 

00:02:47.520 --> 00:02:50.640
 pack a quarter in about 

00:02:49.020 --> 00:02:52.320
 fridge because of course I too 

00:02:50.640 --> 00:02:54.720
 do not throw it away and that's why I have 

00:02:52.320 --> 00:02:56.880
 now with a bit of milk 

00:02:54.720 --> 00:02:58.860
 Lab stirred a bit of jam 

00:02:56.880 --> 00:03:01.620
 mixed in and yet I do not know 

00:02:58.860 --> 00:03:03.990
 if I'm not a few at the frozen 

00:03:01.620 --> 00:03:06.360
 I always have berries there 

00:03:03.990 --> 00:03:09.450
 the little because even purely made to 

00:03:06.360 --> 00:03:12.270
 last but not least as a cause or coffee 

00:03:09.450 --> 00:03:13.500
 substitute a glass of milk because the milk 

00:03:12.270 --> 00:03:16.050
 I can not so then also in 

00:03:13.500 --> 00:03:18.900
 That's why I drink the fridge 

00:03:16.050 --> 00:03:20.610
 Now a glass of milk so that was that 

00:03:18.900 --> 00:03:22.650
 small but fine video I hope it has 

00:03:20.610 --> 00:03:27.150
 you like and see you on 

00:03:22.650 --> 00:03:28.590

00:03:27.150 --> 00:03:33.110
