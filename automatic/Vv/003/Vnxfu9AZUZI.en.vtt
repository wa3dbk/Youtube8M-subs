while we were doing these things and
then<00:01:58.950> we<00:01:59.130> shot<00:01:59.369> a<00:01:59.399> video<00:01:59.810> we<00:02:00.810> realize<00:02:01.200> that<00:02:01.439> the

00:02:01.520 --> 00:02:01.530 
then we shot a video we realize that the

00:02:01.530 --> 00:02:03.800 
then we shot a video we realize that the
video<00:02:01.890> it<00:02:02.610> only<00:02:02.820> took<00:02:03.060> like<00:02:03.119> a<00:02:03.299> couple<00:02:03.719> of

00:02:03.800 --> 00:02:03.810 
video it only took like a couple of

00:02:03.810 --> 00:02:06.350 
video it only took like a couple of
minutes<00:02:04.140> but<00:02:04.979> we<00:02:05.100> realized<00:02:05.640> that<00:02:05.850> these<00:02:06.060> were

00:02:06.350 --> 00:02:06.360 
minutes but we realized that these were

00:02:06.360 --> 00:02:08.029 
minutes but we realized that these were
the<00:02:06.570> most<00:02:06.719> powerful<00:02:07.140> videos<00:02:07.619> that<00:02:07.799> we've<00:02:07.920> ever

00:02:08.029 --> 00:02:08.039 
the most powerful videos that we've ever

00:02:08.039 --> 00:02:09.270 
the most powerful videos that we've ever
shot<00:02:08.459> and<00:02:08.759> that's

00:02:09.270 --> 00:02:09.280 
shot and that's

00:02:09.280 --> 00:02:11.550 
shot and that's
the<00:02:09.340> evidence<00:02:09.850> by<00:02:10.090> our<00:02:10.479> signups<00:02:10.990> we've<00:02:11.200> had<00:02:11.350> I

00:02:11.550 --> 00:02:11.560 
the evidence by our signups we've had I

00:02:11.560 --> 00:02:13.470 
the evidence by our signups we've had I
mean<00:02:11.890> this<00:02:12.220> morning<00:02:12.610> I<00:02:12.670> woke<00:02:12.819> up<00:02:12.970> again<00:02:13.240> had<00:02:13.450> a

00:02:13.470 --> 00:02:13.480 
mean this morning I woke up again had a

00:02:13.480 --> 00:02:15.300 
mean this morning I woke up again had a
new<00:02:13.660> team<00:02:13.900> member<00:02:14.200> joined<00:02:14.410> the<00:02:14.530> business<00:02:14.709> and

00:02:15.300 --> 00:02:15.310 
new team member joined the business and

00:02:15.310 --> 00:02:17.820 
new team member joined the business and
you<00:02:15.910> got<00:02:16.030> to<00:02:16.120> ask<00:02:16.240> yourself<00:02:16.360> why<00:02:16.840> is<00:02:16.870> that<00:02:17.140> you

00:02:17.820 --> 00:02:17.830 
you got to ask yourself why is that you

00:02:17.830 --> 00:02:20.850 
you got to ask yourself why is that you
know<00:02:17.980> and<00:02:18.280> I<00:02:18.310> think<00:02:19.120> it's<00:02:19.420> because<00:02:19.860> people

00:02:20.850 --> 00:02:20.860 
know and I think it's because people

00:02:20.860 --> 00:02:23.880 
know and I think it's because people
want<00:02:21.130> to<00:02:21.310> live<00:02:21.490> a<00:02:21.550> life<00:02:21.670> of<00:02:22.090> freedom<00:02:22.330> and<00:02:22.890> when

00:02:23.880 --> 00:02:23.890 
want to live a life of freedom and when

00:02:23.890 --> 00:02:27.059 
want to live a life of freedom and when
they<00:02:24.310> see<00:02:24.370> you<00:02:24.790> actually<00:02:25.030> doing<00:02:25.600> that<00:02:26.080> going

00:02:27.059 --> 00:02:27.069 
they see you actually doing that going

00:02:27.069 --> 00:02:29.850 
they see you actually doing that going
on<00:02:27.220> vacation<00:02:27.250> with<00:02:28.060> your<00:02:28.209> family<00:02:28.860> traveling
