require I think is costs about 80 bucks

00:00:54.870 --> 00:00:57.560 
require I think is costs about 80 bucks
or<00:00:55.079> something<00:00:55.489> then<00:00:56.489> gets<00:00:56.760> a<00:00:56.910> slightly<00:00:57.300> more

00:00:57.560 --> 00:00:57.570 
or something then gets a slightly more

00:00:57.570 --> 00:01:00.349 
or something then gets a slightly more
expensive<00:00:57.660> plus<00:00:58.230> it's<00:00:58.559> a<00:00:58.739> little<00:00:59.699> bit<00:00:59.850> more<00:01:00.210> of

00:01:00.349 --> 00:01:00.359 
expensive plus it's a little bit more of

00:01:00.359 --> 00:01:01.340 
expensive plus it's a little bit more of
a<00:01:00.390> house<00:01:00.539> when<00:01:00.809> you<00:01:00.870> have<00:01:00.989> to<00:01:01.050> keep<00:01:01.170> changing

00:01:01.340 --> 00:01:01.350 
a house when you have to keep changing

00:01:01.350 --> 00:01:02.900 
a house when you have to keep changing
it<00:01:01.649> back<00:01:01.829> and<00:01:02.039> forth<00:01:02.219> and<00:01:02.340> I<00:01:02.430> need<00:01:02.609> some<00:01:02.789> space

00:01:02.900 --> 00:01:02.910 
it back and forth and I need some space

00:01:02.910 --> 00:01:05.000 
it back and forth and I need some space
to<00:01:03.030> keep<00:01:03.300> a<00:01:03.480> extra<00:01:04.199> one<00:01:04.320> on<00:01:04.409> the<00:01:04.500> side<00:01:04.680> in<00:01:04.860> case

00:01:05.000 --> 00:01:05.010 
to keep a extra one on the side in case

00:01:05.010 --> 00:01:07.609 
to keep a extra one on the side in case
that<00:01:05.159> one<00:01:05.309> runs<00:01:05.489> out<00:01:06.080> so<00:01:07.080> in<00:01:07.170> that<00:01:07.260> sense<00:01:07.500> I

00:01:07.609 --> 00:01:07.619 
that one runs out so in that sense I

00:01:07.619 --> 00:01:09.740 
that one runs out so in that sense I
guess<00:01:07.799> this<00:01:08.100> is<00:01:08.250> pretty<00:01:09.210> good<00:01:09.450> pretty

00:01:09.740 --> 00:01:09.750 
guess this is pretty good pretty

00:01:09.750 --> 00:01:10.789 
guess this is pretty good pretty
convenient<00:01:10.049> doesn't<00:01:10.229> take<00:01:10.470> a<00:01:10.530> lot<00:01:10.619> of<00:01:10.680> space

00:01:10.789 --> 00:01:10.799 
convenient doesn't take a lot of space

00:01:10.799 --> 00:01:12.260 
convenient doesn't take a lot of space
it's<00:01:11.130> just<00:01:11.159> right<00:01:11.490> there

00:01:12.260 --> 00:01:12.270 
it's just right there

00:01:12.270 --> 00:01:13.580 
it's just right there
you<00:01:12.600> always<00:01:12.840> say<00:01:12.930> that<00:01:12.990> the<00:01:13.170> only<00:01:13.290> thing<00:01:13.380> is

00:01:13.580 --> 00:01:13.590 
you always say that the only thing is

00:01:13.590 --> 00:01:15.560 
you always say that the only thing is
that<00:01:13.619> you<00:01:13.710> have<00:01:13.890> to<00:01:14.040> have<00:01:14.210> you<00:01:15.210> have<00:01:15.299> to<00:01:15.420> fill

00:01:15.560 --> 00:01:15.570 
that you have to have you have to fill

00:01:15.570 --> 00:01:17.359 
that you have to have you have to fill
it<00:01:15.659> every<00:01:15.840> day<00:01:15.990> so<00:01:16.290> every<00:01:16.979> day<00:01:17.070> you<00:01:17.159> have<00:01:17.220> to

00:01:17.359 --> 00:01:17.369

00:01:17.369 --> 00:01:18.649 
it every day so every day you have to
fill<00:01:17.520> it<00:01:17.640> whenever<00:01:17.909> you<00:01:18.030> know<00:01:18.119> as<00:01:18.330> per<00:01:18.540> your

00:01:21.320 --> 00:01:21.330 
needs just open the top and just fill in

00:01:21.330 --> 00:01:23.719 
needs just open the top and just fill in
as<00:01:21.600> much<00:01:21.630> water<00:01:21.930> as<00:01:22.049> is<00:01:22.290> necessary<00:01:22.640> from<00:01:23.640> the

as much water as is necessary from the

00:01:23.729 --> 00:01:26.390 
as much water as is necessary from the
top<00:01:23.970> basically<00:01:24.409> and<00:01:25.409> then<00:01:25.950> it<00:01:26.070> just<00:01:26.220> filters

00:01:26.390 --> 00:01:26.400 
top basically and then it just filters

00:01:26.400 --> 00:01:28.249 
top basically and then it just filters
about<00:01:26.729> in<00:01:26.880> about<00:01:26.970> half<00:01:27.479> an<00:01:27.659> hour<00:01:27.750> or<00:01:27.810> so<00:01:28.049> then

00:01:28.249 --> 00:01:28.259 
about in about half an hour or so then

00:01:28.259 --> 00:01:31.969 
about in about half an hour or so then
you<00:01:29.000> water<00:01:30.000> that<00:01:30.210> you<00:01:30.299> need<00:01:30.770> servicing<00:01:31.770> again

00:01:31.969 --> 00:01:31.979 
you water that you need servicing again

00:01:31.979 --> 00:01:33.350 
you water that you need servicing again
there's<00:01:32.159> really<00:01:32.220> no<00:01:32.460> servicing<00:01:32.820> required<00:01:33.119> all

00:01:33.350 --> 00:01:33.360 
there's really no servicing required all

00:01:33.360 --> 00:01:34.760
