to print your planner back to back if
you<00:00:12.469> want<00:00:12.680> to<00:00:12.740> use<00:00:13.299> print<00:00:14.299> it<00:00:14.389> directly<00:00:14.480> on

00:00:14.920 --> 00:00:14.930 
you want to use print it directly on

00:00:14.930 --> 00:00:18.040 
you want to use print it directly on
full-sized<00:00:15.740> paper<00:00:16.010> with<00:00:16.400> two<00:00:16.760> pages<00:00:17.050> per

00:00:18.040 --> 00:00:18.050 
full-sized paper with two pages per

00:00:18.050 --> 00:00:19.990 
full-sized paper with two pages per
piece<00:00:18.380> of<00:00:18.529> paper<00:00:18.740> and<00:00:19.100> then<00:00:19.369> cut<00:00:19.400> it<00:00:19.849> after

00:00:19.990 --> 00:00:20.000 
piece of paper and then cut it after

00:00:20.000 --> 00:00:22.570 
piece of paper and then cut it after
that<00:00:20.470> one<00:00:21.470> reason<00:00:21.769> why<00:00:21.830> you<00:00:21.890> might<00:00:22.220> want<00:00:22.519> to

00:00:22.570 --> 00:00:22.580 
that one reason why you might want to

00:00:22.580 --> 00:00:24.730 
that one reason why you might want to
use<00:00:22.759> this<00:00:22.910> method<00:00:23.330> is<00:00:23.539> sometimes<00:00:24.199> printers

00:00:24.730 --> 00:00:24.740 
use this method is sometimes printers

00:00:24.740 --> 00:00:26.919 
use this method is sometimes printers
don't<00:00:25.490> do<00:00:25.730> well<00:00:25.910> if<00:00:26.029> you<00:00:26.179> put<00:00:26.449> in<00:00:26.599> the<00:00:26.779> half

00:00:26.919 --> 00:00:26.929 
don't do well if you put in the half

00:00:26.929 --> 00:00:28.630 
don't do well if you put in the half
sized<00:00:27.199> pages<00:00:27.560> and<00:00:27.679> try<00:00:27.800> to<00:00:27.859> print<00:00:28.099> directly<00:00:28.220> on

00:00:28.630 --> 00:00:28.640 
sized pages and try to print directly on

00:00:28.640 --> 00:00:31.179 
sized pages and try to print directly on
them<00:00:28.849> so<00:00:29.390> this<00:00:29.509> is<00:00:29.570> another<00:00:29.900> alternative<00:00:30.650> it's

00:00:31.179 --> 00:00:31.189 
them so this is another alternative it's

00:00:31.189 --> 00:00:33.010 
them so this is another alternative it's
a<00:00:31.310> little<00:00:31.519> bit<00:00:31.640> more<00:00:31.820> complicated<00:00:32.360> but<00:00:32.840> it's

00:00:33.010 --> 00:00:33.020 
a little bit more complicated but it's

00:00:33.020 --> 00:00:35.319 
a little bit more complicated but it's
really<00:00:33.110> I<00:00:33.770> don't<00:00:34.010> think<00:00:34.160> it's<00:00:34.250> difficult<00:00:34.430> so<00:00:35.030> I

00:00:35.319 --> 00:00:35.329 
really I don't think it's difficult so I

00:00:35.329 --> 00:00:37.510 
really I don't think it's difficult so I
have<00:00:36.020> the<00:00:36.110> same<00:00:36.320> file<00:00:36.530> open<00:00:37.010> here<00:00:37.340> and<00:00:37.460> edit

00:00:37.510 --> 00:00:37.520 
have the same file open here and edit

00:00:37.520 --> 00:00:40.000 
have the same file open here and edit
the<00:00:37.760> free<00:00:38.000> Adobe<00:00:38.240> Reader<00:00:38.540> that<00:00:38.900> you<00:00:39.080> should

00:01:30.010 --> 00:01:30.020 
going to print three pages front and

00:01:30.020 --> 00:01:33.639 
going to print three pages front and
back<00:01:30.200> and<00:01:30.560> here<00:01:31.369> you<00:01:31.549> can<00:01:31.670> do<00:01:31.789> both<00:01:31.969> sides<00:01:32.649> that

00:01:33.639 --> 00:01:33.649 
back and here you can do both sides that

00:01:33.649 --> 00:01:34.809 
back and here you can do both sides that
would<00:01:33.770> be<00:01:33.859> if<00:01:33.979> you<00:01:34.069> actually<00:01:34.249> wanted<00:01:34.700> your

00:01:34.809 --> 00:01:34.819 
would be if you actually wanted your

00:01:34.819 --> 00:01:37.800 
would be if you actually wanted your
printer<00:01:35.210> to<00:01:35.389> do<00:01:35.509> double-sided<00:01:35.929> printing<00:01:36.499> mine

00:01:37.800 --> 00:01:37.810 
printer to do double-sided printing mine

00:01:37.810 --> 00:01:40.330 
printer to do double-sided printing mine
it<00:01:38.810> actually<00:01:39.229> doesn't<00:01:39.380> do<00:01:39.560> it<00:01:39.679> correctly<00:01:40.100> even

00:01:40.330 --> 00:01:40.340 
it actually doesn't do it correctly even

00:01:40.340 --> 00:01:41.950 
it actually doesn't do it correctly even
though<00:01:40.490> it<00:01:40.579> has<00:01:40.729> that<00:01:40.909> feature<00:01:41.090> so<00:01:41.420> I<00:01:41.450> print

00:01:41.950 --> 00:01:41.960 
though it has that feature so I print

00:01:41.960 --> 00:01:43.870 
though it has that feature so I print
all<00:01:42.319> the<00:01:42.649> Front's<00:01:43.009> and<00:01:43.219> then<00:01:43.490> I<00:01:43.520> print<00:01:43.819> the

00:01:43.870 --> 00:01:43.880 
all the Front's and then I print the

00:01:43.880 --> 00:01:45.550 
all the Front's and then I print the
back<00:01:44.060> so<00:01:44.329> you<00:01:44.389> can<00:01:44.569> just<00:01:44.869> say<00:01:45.020> front<00:01:45.289> sides

00:01:45.550 --> 00:01:45.560 
back so you can just say front sides

00:01:45.560 --> 00:01:48.419 
back so you can just say front sides
only<00:01:45.799> and<00:01:46.299> by<00:01:47.299> knees<00:01:47.539> should<00:01:47.749> be<00:01:47.780> left

00:01:48.419 --> 00:01:48.429 
only and by knees should be left

00:01:48.429 --> 00:01:50.410 
only and by knees should be left
orientation<00:01:49.429> make<00:01:49.609> sure<00:01:49.850> that<00:01:50.179> is<00:01:50.299> selected

00:01:50.410 --> 00:01:50.420 
orientation make sure that is selected

00:01:50.420 --> 00:01:52.989 
orientation make sure that is selected
as<00:01:50.749> landscape<00:01:51.499> and<00:01:52.100> I'm<00:01:52.219> gonna<00:01:52.340> double<00:01:52.670> check

00:01:52.989 --> 00:01:52.999 
as landscape and I'm gonna double check

00:01:52.999 --> 00:01:57.309 
as landscape and I'm gonna double check
that<00:01:53.469> my<00:01:54.469> paper<00:01:54.799> is<00:01:55.189> set<00:01:55.429> correctly<00:01:55.899> because<00:01:56.899> I

00:01:57.309 --> 00:01:57.319 
that my paper is set correctly because I

00:01:57.319 --> 00:02:02.050 
that my paper is set correctly because I
previously<00:01:58.130> used<00:01:58.520> a<00:01:59.200> special<00:02:00.639> setting<00:02:01.639> so<00:02:01.999> you

00:02:02.050 --> 00:02:02.060 
previously used a special setting so you

00:02:02.060 --> 00:02:05.109 
previously used a special setting so you
want<00:02:02.299> it<00:02:02.389> to<00:02:02.569> be<00:02:02.719> a<00:02:02.929> letter<00:02:03.109> size<00:02:03.380> paper<00:02:04.119> which

00:02:05.109 --> 00:02:05.119 
want it to be a letter size paper which

00:02:05.119 --> 00:02:07.209 
want it to be a letter size paper which
I've<00:02:05.240> just<00:02:05.270> change<00:02:05.659> it<00:02:05.810> to<00:02:05.840> okay<00:02:06.439> so<00:02:06.859> that's

00:02:07.209 --> 00:02:07.219 
I've just change it to okay so that's

00:02:07.219 --> 00:02:08.499 
I've just change it to okay so that's
what's<00:02:07.579> gonna<00:02:07.759> print<00:02:08.030> you<00:02:08.119> can<00:02:08.240> see<00:02:08.360> a<00:02:08.390> little

00:02:08.499 --> 00:02:08.509 
what's gonna print you can see a little

00:02:08.509 --> 00:02:10.619 
what's gonna print you can see a little
preview<00:02:08.780> and<00:02:09.110> I<00:02:09.470> know<00:02:09.800> it<00:02:10.009> doesn't

00:02:10.619 --> 00:02:10.629 
preview and I know it doesn't

00:02:10.629 --> 00:02:14.589 
preview and I know it doesn't
necessarily<00:02:11.629> make<00:02:11.840> a<00:02:12.200> lot<00:02:12.680> of<00:02:12.709> sense<00:02:13.269> but<00:02:14.269> it

00:02:14.589 --> 00:02:14.599 
necessarily make a lot of sense but it

00:02:14.599 --> 00:02:17.050 
necessarily make a lot of sense but it
will<00:02:15.230> work<00:02:15.470> it's<00:02:15.769> actually<00:02:16.159> doing<00:02:16.459> all<00:02:16.670> of<00:02:16.730> the

00:02:17.050 --> 00:02:17.060 
will work it's actually doing all of the

00:02:17.060 --> 00:02:17.410 
will work it's actually doing all of the
thinking

00:02:17.410 --> 00:02:17.420

00:02:23.650 --> 00:02:23.660 
and it's gonna print those pages on a

00:02:23.660 --> 00:02:26.620 
and it's gonna print those pages on a
full-size<00:02:24.230> of<00:02:24.260> paper<00:02:24.800> for<00:02:25.130> me<00:02:25.250> okay<00:02:26.180> so<00:02:26.239> this

00:02:26.620 --> 00:02:26.630 
full-size of paper for me okay so this

00:02:26.630 --> 00:02:28.949 
full-size of paper for me okay so this
is<00:02:26.840> exactly<00:02:27.349> what<00:02:27.890> came<00:02:28.099> out<00:02:28.220> of<00:02:28.280> my<00:02:28.430> printer

00:02:28.949 --> 00:02:28.959 
is exactly what came out of my printer

00:02:28.959 --> 00:02:32.410 
is exactly what came out of my printer
and<00:02:29.959> what<00:02:30.770> you<00:02:30.890> want<00:02:31.040> to<00:02:31.099> do<00:02:31.310> is<00:02:31.760> reverse<00:02:32.180> the

00:02:32.410 --> 00:02:32.420 
and what you want to do is reverse the

00:02:32.420 --> 00:02:34.180 
and what you want to do is reverse the
order<00:02:32.599> like<00:02:33.020> I<00:02:33.200> said<00:02:33.500> before<00:02:33.650> you<00:02:33.920> know<00:02:33.950> that

00:02:34.180 --> 00:02:34.190 
order like I said before you know that

00:02:34.190 --> 00:02:36.790 
order like I said before you know that
doesn't<00:02:34.520> mean<00:02:35.050> turn<00:02:36.050> it<00:02:36.170> over<00:02:36.290> that<00:02:36.560> means

00:02:36.790 --> 00:02:36.800 
doesn't mean turn it over that means

00:02:36.800 --> 00:02:39.490 
doesn't mean turn it over that means
take<00:02:37.520> each<00:02:37.760> page<00:02:38.120> you<00:02:38.480> see<00:02:38.810> back<00:02:39.020> to<00:02:39.050> these<00:02:39.319> are

00:02:39.490 --> 00:02:39.500 
take each page you see back to these are

00:02:39.500 --> 00:02:41.559 
take each page you see back to these are
blank<00:02:39.770> and<00:02:40.010> go<00:02:40.790> like<00:02:40.970> this

00:02:41.559 --> 00:02:41.569 
blank and go like this

00:02:41.569 --> 00:02:44.110 
blank and go like this
so<00:02:41.959> just<00:02:42.200> reverse<00:02:42.590> the<00:02:43.340> order<00:02:43.519> of<00:02:43.760> every

00:02:44.110 --> 00:02:44.120 
so just reverse the order of every

00:02:44.120 --> 00:02:52.660 
so just reverse the order of every
single<00:02:44.330> page<00:02:45.340> next<00:02:46.340> you<00:02:47.330> want<00:02:47.540> to<00:02:47.599> put<00:02:47.870> it<00:02:51.670> make

00:02:52.660 --> 00:02:52.670 
single page next you want to put it make

00:02:52.670 --> 00:02:54.850 
single page next you want to put it make
sure<00:02:52.850> you<00:02:52.940> how<00:02:53.120> it<00:02:53.180> works<00:02:53.330> in<00:02:53.510> my<00:02:53.720> printer<00:02:54.170> but

00:02:54.850 --> 00:02:54.860 
sure you how it works in my printer but

00:02:54.860 --> 00:02:58.449 
sure you how it works in my printer but
every<00:02:55.310> printer<00:02:55.760> is<00:02:55.910> different<00:02:56.950> the<00:02:57.950> direction

00:02:58.449 --> 00:02:58.459 
every printer is different the direction

00:02:58.459 --> 00:03:00.400 
every printer is different the direction
you<00:02:58.580> want<00:02:58.760> to<00:02:58.819> go<00:02:58.880> to<00:02:59.090> make<00:02:59.690> it<00:02:59.840> Point<00:03:00.049> Park<00:03:00.200> on

00:03:00.400 --> 00:03:00.410 
you want to go to make it Point Park on

00:03:00.410 --> 00:03:02.309 
you want to go to make it Point Park on
the<00:03:00.500> back<00:03:00.650> side<00:03:00.890> so<00:03:00.950> you're<00:03:01.250> gonna<00:03:01.370> have<00:03:01.640> to

00:03:02.309 --> 00:03:02.319 
the back side so you're gonna have to

00:03:02.319 --> 00:03:04.630 
the back side so you're gonna have to
figure<00:03:03.319> that<00:03:03.530> out<00:03:03.590> for<00:03:03.739> your<00:03:04.160> particular

00:03:04.630 --> 00:03:04.640

00:03:04.640 --> 00:03:08.680 
figure that out for your particular
printer<00:03:05.260> that's<00:03:06.260> how<00:03:06.530> I<00:03:06.560> do<00:03:06.739> it<00:03:06.860> for<00:03:07.069> mine<00:03:07.690> then

00:03:08.680 --> 00:03:08.690

printer that's how I do it for mine then
I'm<00:03:08.810> gonna<00:03:08.930> go<00:03:09.080> tell<00:03:09.290> the<00:03:09.440> printer<00:03:09.680> to<00:03:10.069> print

00:03:11.789 --> 00:03:11.799

00:03:43.539 --> 00:03:43.549 
the back sides so I just say back side

00:03:43.549 --> 00:03:46.449 
the back sides so I just say back side
only<00:03:43.760> the<00:03:44.630> other<00:03:44.780> stuff<00:03:45.109> is<00:03:45.290> already<00:03:45.560> set

00:03:46.449 --> 00:03:46.459 
only the other stuff is already set

00:03:46.459 --> 00:04:02.180 
only the other stuff is already set
correctly<00:03:46.760> and<00:03:47.329> I<00:03:47.780> say<00:03:48.019> pritch

00:04:02.180 --> 00:04:02.190 

00:04:02.190 --> 00:04:15.500 

and<00:04:04.130> at<00:04:05.130> this<00:04:05.310> stage<00:04:13.460> is<00:04:14.460> actually<00:04:15.180> kind<00:04:15.450> of

00:04:15.500 --> 00:04:15.510 
and at this stage is actually kind of

00:04:15.510 --> 00:04:18.830 
and at this stage is actually kind of
picturing<00:04:16.040> that<00:04:17.040> you<00:04:17.190> would<00:04:17.340> do<00:04:17.489> like<00:04:17.670> this<00:04:18.000> to

00:04:18.830 --> 00:04:18.840 
picturing that you would do like this to

00:04:18.840 --> 00:04:21.380 
picturing that you would do like this to
make<00:04:18.989> the<00:04:19.170> booklet<00:04:19.560> and<00:04:19.860> just<00:04:20.670> you<00:04:20.790> know<00:04:20.880> find

00:04:25.560 --> 00:04:29.050 
you want to do you want to cut that's
why<00:04:25.920> the<00:04:26.820> order<00:04:27.210> while<00:04:27.750> it<00:04:27.990> works<00:04:28.290> I<00:04:28.500> promise

00:04:29.050 --> 00:04:29.060 
why the order while it works I promise

00:04:29.060 --> 00:04:31.670 
why the order while it works I promise
doesn't<00:04:30.060> necessarily<00:04:30.720> make<00:04:30.840> a<00:04:30.900> ton<00:04:31.320> of<00:04:31.350> sense

00:04:31.670 --> 00:04:31.680 
doesn't necessarily make a ton of sense

00:04:31.680 --> 00:04:35.210 
doesn't necessarily make a ton of sense
if<00:04:32.670> you're<00:04:32.730> just<00:04:33.000> glancing<00:04:33.630> at<00:04:34.080> it<00:04:34.110> so<00:04:34.620> the

00:04:35.210 --> 00:04:35.220 
if you're just glancing at it so the

00:04:35.220 --> 00:04:40.520 
if you're just glancing at it so the
next<00:04:35.250> thing<00:04:35.640> I<00:04:35.730> need<00:04:36.090> to<00:04:36.150> do<00:04:36.390> is<00:04:38.330> I<00:04:39.530> recommend

00:04:40.520 --> 00:04:40.530 
next thing I need to do is I recommend

00:04:40.530 --> 00:04:50.300 
next thing I need to do is I recommend
using<00:04:40.860> a<00:04:41.010> decent<00:04:41.370> paper<00:04:41.580> cutter<00:04:49.160> down<00:04:50.160> the

00:04:50.300 --> 00:04:50.310 
using a decent paper cutter down the

00:04:50.310 --> 00:04:56.090 
using a decent paper cutter down the
middle<00:04:53.120> so<00:04:54.120> here<00:04:54.930> I<00:04:54.960> have<00:04:55.260> all<00:04:55.530> of<00:04:55.740> my<00:04:55.860> pages

00:04:56.090 --> 00:04:56.100 
middle so here I have all of my pages

00:04:56.100 --> 00:04:59.470 
middle so here I have all of my pages
and<00:04:56.670> the<00:04:57.480> next<00:04:57.750> thing<00:04:57.900> I<00:04:57.960> need<00:04:58.080> to<00:04:58.170> do<00:04:58.350> is<00:04:58.740> just

00:04:59.470 --> 00:04:59.480 
and the next thing I need to do is just

00:04:59.480 --> 00:05:05.840 
and the next thing I need to do is just
put<00:05:00.480> them<00:05:00.690> in<00:05:01.560> order<00:05:04.340> so<00:05:05.340> I<00:05:05.370> think<00:05:05.580> it<00:05:05.730> actually

00:05:05.840 --> 00:05:05.850 
put them in order so I think it actually

00:05:05.850 --> 00:05:07.280 
put them in order so I think it actually
works<00:05:06.180> out<00:05:06.450> pretty<00:05:06.540> well<00:05:06.690> if<00:05:06.870> you<00:05:06.960> just<00:05:07.080> go

00:05:07.280 --> 00:05:07.290 
works out pretty well if you just go

00:05:07.290 --> 00:05:11.180 
works out pretty well if you just go
like<00:05:07.440> that<00:05:07.650> and<00:05:08.010> then<00:05:08.940> you'll<00:05:09.570> see<00:05:09.980> this<00:05:10.980> is

00:05:11.180 --> 00:05:11.190 
like that and then you'll see this is

00:05:11.190 --> 00:05:12.050 
like that and then you'll see this is
the<00:05:11.370> correct

00:05:12.050 --> 00:05:12.060 
the correct

00:05:12.060 --> 00:05:14.270 
the correct
it<00:05:12.150> starts<00:05:12.420> with<00:05:12.510> January<00:05:13.050> then<00:05:13.830> the<00:05:14.010> first

00:05:14.270 --> 00:05:14.280 
it starts with January then the first

00:05:14.280 --> 00:05:19.400 
it starts with January then the first
week<00:05:14.580> of<00:05:14.790> January<00:05:15.060> is<00:05:15.630> here<00:05:16.040> second<00:05:17.040> week<00:05:18.410> the

00:05:19.400 --> 00:05:19.410 
week of January is here second week the

00:05:23.090 --> 00:05:23.100 
next week and so on so that will get it

00:05:23.100 --> 00:05:26.510 
next week and so on so that will get it
set<00:05:23.340> up<00:05:23.370> for<00:05:23.760> you<00:05:24.000> just<00:05:24.980> like<00:05:25.980> you<00:05:26.100> need<00:05:26.250> it<00:05:26.400> and
