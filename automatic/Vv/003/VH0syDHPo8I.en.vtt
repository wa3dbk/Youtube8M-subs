00:00:06.080 --> 00:00:09.590
 hello how are you last week 

00:00:08.180 --> 00:00:11.540
 Alejandro later he started with the 

00:00:09.590 --> 00:00:13.879
 first stage of a shed for this 

00:00:11.540 --> 00:00:15.740
 terrace work first on the beam remains 

00:00:13.879 --> 00:00:17.869
 the wall that is going to support the 

00:00:15.740 --> 00:00:20.840
 structure making the drafts then 

00:00:17.869 --> 00:00:23.300
 the fixed with anchor bolts made the 

00:00:20.840 --> 00:00:25.939
 chickens of concrete calculated the slope 

00:00:23.300 --> 00:00:27.980
 and finally put the pillars the chickens 

00:00:25.939 --> 00:00:29.449
 they are already dry and the pillars are very firm 

00:00:27.980 --> 00:00:32.000
 so today it's my turn in the end 

00:00:29.449 --> 00:00:35.420
 first let's install the framework of the 

00:00:32.000 --> 00:00:36.980
 roofing then the interior beams and 

00:00:35.420 --> 00:00:39.650
 the secondary ones that will support the 

00:00:36.980 --> 00:00:41.780
 planks of threshing and we will finish the 

00:00:39.650 --> 00:00:45.650
 chickens with stucco and paint and 

00:00:41.780 --> 00:00:47.239
 we will protect the wood we will overtake 

00:00:45.650 --> 00:00:48.710
 with the completion of the chickens since 

00:00:47.239 --> 00:00:51.049
 before painting we have to wait 

00:00:48.710 --> 00:00:52.640
 dry the stucco you have to use a 

00:00:51.049 --> 00:00:55.210
 mix for exterior that has additives 

00:00:52.640 --> 00:00:55.210
 against moisture 

00:00:55.480 --> 00:00:59.360
 [Music] 

00:00:57.590 --> 00:01:01.190
 we take out the box that was obtained on 

00:00:59.360 --> 00:01:03.500
 chicken and we apply the stucco with the 

00:01:01.190 --> 00:01:05.900
 banana trying to form the corners and 

00:01:03.500 --> 00:01:10.060
 the silver step we just spent several 

00:01:05.900 --> 00:01:10.060
 times until you have even and smooth them tube 

00:01:10.380 --> 00:01:15.079
 knows that the elements 

00:01:16.140 --> 00:01:20.880
 and now let's make the frame that they are 

00:01:18.360 --> 00:01:23.400
 two laterals and the front that goes here 

00:01:20.880 --> 00:01:25.560
 they are also 2 x 8 tables just like the 

00:01:23.400 --> 00:01:27.150
 that goes on the wall and the union between these 

00:01:25.560 --> 00:01:36.390
 tables we are going to do with screws 

00:01:27.150 --> 00:01:38.400
 screws to pass the screw 

00:01:36.390 --> 00:01:40.380
 we have to drill with bits of 8 

00:01:38.400 --> 00:01:42.670
 millimeters crossing the two woods 

00:01:40.380 --> 00:01:44.979
 together 

00:01:42.670 --> 00:01:47.170
 are two fixations for each union and 

00:01:44.979 --> 00:01:48.729
 then with a key, it is screwed 

00:01:47.170 --> 00:01:50.869
 the bottom strip until it is well 

00:01:48.729 --> 00:01:54.470
 caught 

00:01:50.869 --> 00:01:54.470
 and more 

00:01:55.810 --> 00:01:59.760
 your sweets 

00:01:58.140 --> 00:02:02.820
 watts in step 

00:01:59.760 --> 00:02:06.500
 [Music] 

00:02:02.820 --> 00:02:12.760
 is what you expect from you 

00:02:06.500 --> 00:02:15.159
 [Music] 

00:02:12.760 --> 00:02:16.720
 besides the framework the structure that goes to 

00:02:15.159 --> 00:02:19.450
 support the roofing do with tables 

00:02:16.720 --> 00:02:21.640
 of 26 inches we will have three beams 

00:02:19.450 --> 00:02:23.260
 main perpendicular to the wall and 

00:02:21.640 --> 00:02:25.420
 two secondary schools parallel to the wall that 

00:02:23.260 --> 00:02:28.030
 they go on all the lace are going to be 

00:02:25.420 --> 00:02:29.830
 with cuts to half wood 

00:02:28.030 --> 00:02:32.319
 let's go through the three beams 

00:02:29.830 --> 00:02:34.090
 interiors that as they rest on the beam 

00:02:32.319 --> 00:02:36.160
 of the wall they need us to do a 

00:02:34.090 --> 00:02:37.900
 openwork that completes that lace what 

00:02:36.160 --> 00:02:41.380
 we do right at the end with a long 

00:02:37.900 --> 00:02:43.750
 8 cm and a width of 4.5 the 

00:02:41.380 --> 00:02:45.850
 We make cuts with saw procuring 

00:02:43.750 --> 00:02:48.330
 that the blade is longer than the thickness 

00:02:45.850 --> 00:02:48.330
 From the wood 

00:02:53.620 --> 00:02:57.400
 in these same tables you have to do two 

00:02:55.599 --> 00:02:59.110
 more drafts to support the beams 

00:02:57.400 --> 00:03:01.180
 that go on top of the secondary crumbs 

00:02:59.110 --> 00:03:04.000
 these cuts are going to go to a meter of 

00:03:01.180 --> 00:03:04.720
 distance and they will have a length of 7.5 

00:03:04.000 --> 00:03:05.840
 centimeters 

00:03:04.720 --> 00:03:07.240
 [Music] 

00:03:05.840 --> 00:03:08.470
 [Applause] 

00:03:07.240 --> 00:03:11.250
 [Music] 

00:03:08.470 --> 00:03:13.620
 It is also cut with jigsaw 

00:03:11.250 --> 00:03:15.420
 and we use a chisel to mark the draft 

00:03:13.620 --> 00:03:17.030
 take out the piece and lower the 

00:03:15.420 --> 00:03:27.020
 imperfections 

00:03:17.030 --> 00:03:29.720
 [Music] 

00:03:27.020 --> 00:03:31.670
 to complete these laces we have to 

00:03:29.720 --> 00:03:34.760
 make drafts in secondary crumbs 

00:03:31.670 --> 00:03:36.440
 that measure three meters 92 centimeters are 

00:03:34.760 --> 00:03:37.790
 3 drafts per each one that go to 

00:03:36.440 --> 00:03:41.270
 match the drafts we made 

00:03:37.790 --> 00:03:43.700
 to the main crumbs first we mark 

00:03:41.270 --> 00:03:46.220
 the location of the first draft 

00:03:43.700 --> 00:03:49.040
 to the axis that is to say a meter 96 

00:03:46.220 --> 00:03:52.120
 centimeters and the other two to one meter 

00:03:49.040 --> 00:03:55.160
 away from that axis 

00:03:52.120 --> 00:03:56.780
 each draft measures 4.5 width 

00:03:55.160 --> 00:03:59.470
 centimeters long 

00:03:56.780 --> 00:03:59.470
 75 

00:04:01.010 --> 00:04:04.490
 [Music] 

00:04:02.780 --> 00:04:06.050
 when we already have all the drafts 

00:04:04.490 --> 00:04:08.300
 ready and before assembling the structure 

00:04:06.050 --> 00:04:09.980
 let's take everything away to clean the 

00:04:08.300 --> 00:04:17.379
 wood and take out all the splinters 

00:04:09.980 --> 00:04:17.379
 [Music] 

00:04:20.380 --> 00:04:24.580
 for assembly apart from fitting 

00:04:22.570 --> 00:04:26.740
 the drafts we are going to put a strip funds 

00:04:24.580 --> 00:04:28.529
 with cold tail for exteriors and so on 

00:04:26.740 --> 00:04:32.419
 it's going to be much firmer 

00:04:28.529 --> 00:04:32.419
 to me 

00:04:37.190 --> 00:04:41.570
 in the unions with the frame where the 

00:04:39.260 --> 00:04:43.760
 beam is portento without lace we are going to 

00:04:41.570 --> 00:04:45.560
 put two strips funds we're going to 

00:04:43.760 --> 00:04:47.600
 adjust with the ratchet and the 

00:04:45.560 --> 00:04:50.340
 final to give the last tightening we use 

00:04:47.600 --> 00:05:04.710
 the French key 

00:04:50.340 --> 00:05:07.500
 [Music] 

00:05:04.710 --> 00:05:10.440
 now we have chapter protection for 

00:05:07.500 --> 00:05:12.240
 the stucco we're going to use a latex from 

00:05:10.440 --> 00:05:14.430
 same color as the house and for 

00:05:12.240 --> 00:05:16.170
 woods an impregnant that penetrates the 

00:05:14.430 --> 00:05:18.740
 surface of the wood to leave it to 

00:05:16.170 --> 00:05:18.740
 boron open 

00:05:30.770 --> 00:05:33.870
 [Music] 

00:05:37.860 --> 00:05:42.629
 the triage is protected before fixing them 

00:05:40.500 --> 00:05:46.430
 because that way we can impregnate it for its 

00:05:42.629 --> 00:05:46.430
 two faces and between the grid 

00:05:47.139 --> 00:05:51.129
 once it dried we put it on the 

00:05:49.569 --> 00:05:52.930
 secondary lives and they are fixed with 

00:05:51.129 --> 00:05:54.939
 wood screws you have to try 

00:05:52.930 --> 00:05:57.490
 that the edge is at the center of the 

00:05:54.939 --> 00:05:59.320
 beams otherwise we would have to cut it for 

00:05:57.490 --> 00:06:04.250
 find that measure 

00:05:59.320 --> 00:06:06.900
 [Music] 

00:06:04.250 --> 00:06:08.550
 stars is a very good option because 

00:06:06.900 --> 00:06:10.470
 in summer it allows the circulation of 

00:06:08.550 --> 00:06:12.150
 air and the shadow but we could 

00:06:10.470 --> 00:06:14.490
 put a polycarbonate plate or 

00:06:12.150 --> 00:06:15.510
 totora over actually the iron that 

00:06:14.490 --> 00:06:18.200
 you want 

00:06:15.510 --> 00:06:20.240
 [Music] 

00:06:18.200 --> 00:06:21.830
 we finished the shed and the truth that 

00:06:20.240 --> 00:06:23.960
 a space is as nice as this 

00:06:21.830 --> 00:06:25.760
 It is ideal to put a dining room or 

00:06:23.960 --> 00:06:27.800
 example some armchairs that allow us 

00:06:25.760 --> 00:06:29.090
 Enjoy the garden if you missed some 

00:06:27.800 --> 00:06:31.220
 detail remember that you can go back to 

00:06:29.090 --> 00:06:35.110
 see in www point here this same point 

00:06:31.220 --> 00:06:35.110
 cl see you next week chau chau
