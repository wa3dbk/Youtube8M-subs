00:01:17.040 --> 00:01:18.230 
lethal czar quite interesting in this
game<00:01:17.280> and<00:01:17.460> the<00:01:17.610> first<00:01:17.640> thing<00:01:17.909> wouldn't<00:01:18.180> be

00:01:18.230 --> 00:01:18.240 
game and the first thing wouldn't be

00:01:18.240 --> 00:01:19.580 
game and the first thing wouldn't be
looking<00:01:18.360> at<00:01:18.600> as<00:01:18.810> you<00:01:19.049> can<00:01:19.170> see<00:01:19.350> on<00:01:19.409> the<00:01:19.500> screen

00:01:19.580 --> 00:01:19.590 
looking at as you can see on the screen

00:01:19.590 --> 00:01:21.499 
looking at as you can see on the screen
as<00:01:19.920> actually<00:01:20.610> the<00:01:20.729> frag<00:01:20.939> grenade<00:01:21.240> so<00:01:21.360> I<00:01:21.420> have

00:01:21.499 --> 00:01:21.509 
as actually the frag grenade so I have

00:01:21.509 --> 00:01:23.149 
as actually the frag grenade so I have
pictured<00:01:21.930> the<00:01:22.080> pictures<00:01:22.470> of<00:01:22.590> these<00:01:22.710> things<00:01:22.890> I

00:01:23.149 --> 00:01:23.159 
pictured the pictures of these things I

00:01:23.159 --> 00:01:25.160 
pictured the pictures of these things I
can<00:01:23.580> so<00:01:23.939> you<00:01:24.000> can<00:01:24.210> see<00:01:24.360> exactly<00:01:24.600> how<00:01:24.869> it<00:01:24.990> looks

00:01:25.160 --> 00:01:25.170 
can so you can see exactly how it looks

00:01:25.170 --> 00:01:26.390 
can so you can see exactly how it looks
so<00:01:25.290> the<00:01:25.380> first<00:01:25.590> thing<00:01:25.650> is<00:01:25.830> a<00:01:25.860> frag<00:01:26.100> grenade

00:01:26.390 --> 00:01:26.400 
so the first thing is a frag grenade

00:01:26.400 --> 00:01:28.700 
so the first thing is a frag grenade
pretty<00:01:26.970> simple<00:01:27.180> stuff<00:01:27.479> basically<00:01:27.869> produces

00:01:28.700 --> 00:01:28.710 
pretty simple stuff basically produces

00:01:28.710 --> 00:01:30.440 
pretty simple stuff basically produces
lethal<00:01:29.070> radius<00:01:29.369> damage<00:01:29.729> upon<00:01:30.090> detonation

00:01:30.440 --> 00:01:30.450 
lethal radius damage upon detonation

00:01:30.450 --> 00:01:32.539 
lethal radius damage upon detonation
that's<00:01:30.960> exactly<00:01:31.320> what<00:01:31.530> it<00:01:31.560> says<00:01:31.829> and<00:01:32.040> to<00:01:32.430> be

00:01:32.539 --> 00:01:32.549 
that's exactly what it says and to be

00:01:32.549 --> 00:01:34.340 
that's exactly what it says and to be
honest<00:01:32.850> I<00:01:32.970> really<00:01:33.000> do<00:01:33.420> like<00:01:33.600> the<00:01:33.750> graphics<00:01:34.049> and

00:01:34.340 --> 00:01:34.350 
honest I really do like the graphics and

00:01:34.350 --> 00:01:36.109 
honest I really do like the graphics and
it<00:01:34.500> kind<00:01:34.710> of<00:01:34.740> has<00:01:34.920> like<00:01:35.070> the<00:01:35.220> same<00:01:35.490> black<00:01:35.880> ops

00:01:36.109 --> 00:01:36.119 
it kind of has like the same black ops

00:01:36.119 --> 00:01:38.270 
it kind of has like the same black ops
one<00:01:36.420> black<00:01:36.720> ops<00:01:36.960> 2<00:01:37.140> r.d<00:01:37.380> style<00:01:37.829> to<00:01:37.979> everything

00:01:38.270 --> 00:01:38.280 
one black ops 2 r.d style to everything

00:01:38.280 --> 00:01:40.219 
one black ops 2 r.d style to everything
which<00:01:38.850> I<00:01:38.970> do<00:01:39.030> like<00:01:39.299> so<00:01:39.450> you<00:01:39.540> have<00:01:39.689> the<00:01:39.869> frag

00:01:40.219 --> 00:01:40.229 
which I do like so you have the frag

00:01:40.229 --> 00:01:41.420 
which I do like so you have the frag
grenade<00:01:40.560> over<00:01:40.740> there<00:01:40.890> looks<00:01:41.070> quite<00:01:41.280> nice

00:01:41.420 --> 00:01:41.430 
grenade over there looks quite nice

00:01:41.430 --> 00:01:43.399 
grenade over there looks quite nice
looks<00:01:41.700> a<00:01:41.790> bit<00:01:41.909> different<00:01:41.970> to<00:01:42.869> what<00:01:42.990> we<00:01:43.049> usually

00:01:43.399 --> 00:01:43.409 
looks a bit different to what we usually

00:01:43.409 --> 00:01:45.230 
looks a bit different to what we usually
see<00:01:43.649> in<00:01:44.100> Call<00:01:44.340> of<00:01:44.369> Duty<00:01:44.790> the<00:01:44.880> next<00:01:45.090> thing<00:01:45.210> is

00:01:45.230 --> 00:01:45.240 
see in Call of Duty the next thing is

00:01:45.240 --> 00:01:47.330 
see in Call of Duty the next thing is
the<00:01:45.509> semtex<00:01:45.780> this<00:01:46.710> kind<00:01:46.890> of<00:01:46.920> looks<00:01:47.100> like<00:01:47.159> an

00:01:47.330 --> 00:01:47.340 
the semtex this kind of looks like an

00:01:47.340 --> 00:01:49.580 
the semtex this kind of looks like an
avocado<00:01:47.490> wrapped<00:01:48.329> around<00:01:48.509> with<00:01:48.930> a<00:01:48.960> belt<00:01:49.409> or

00:01:49.580 --> 00:01:49.590 
avocado wrapped around with a belt or

00:01:49.590 --> 00:01:51.440 
avocado wrapped around with a belt or
something<00:01:49.740> in<00:01:49.979> my<00:01:50.040> honest<00:01:50.340> opinion<00:01:50.729> but<00:01:51.299> as

00:01:51.440 --> 00:01:51.450 
something in my honest opinion but as

00:01:51.450 --> 00:01:52.819 
something in my honest opinion but as
you<00:01:51.540> can<00:01:51.600> tell<00:01:51.659> it<00:01:51.840> is<00:01:51.899> the<00:01:52.020> semtex<00:01:52.229> it<00:01:52.649> says

00:01:52.819 --> 00:01:52.829 
you can tell it is the semtex it says

00:01:52.829 --> 00:01:54.469 
you can tell it is the semtex it says
grenade<00:01:53.159> that<00:01:53.340> sticks<00:01:53.640> to<00:01:53.790> surfaces<00:01:53.970> before

00:01:54.469 --> 00:01:54.479 
grenade that sticks to surfaces before

00:01:54.479 --> 00:01:56.630 
grenade that sticks to surfaces before
detonating<00:01:55.229> I<00:01:55.500> don't<00:01:56.009> think<00:01:56.130> there<00:01:56.430> was<00:01:56.579> a

00:01:56.630 --> 00:01:56.640 
detonating I don't think there was a

00:01:56.640 --> 00:01:58.789 
detonating I don't think there was a
semtex<00:01:57.180> in<00:01:57.390> black<00:01:57.600> ops<00:01:57.810> 2<00:01:57.930> oh<00:01:58.320> wait<00:01:58.560> no<00:01:58.680> sorry

00:01:58.789 --> 00:01:58.799 
semtex in black ops 2 oh wait no sorry

00:01:58.799 --> 00:01:59.959 
semtex in black ops 2 oh wait no sorry
there<00:01:59.009> was<00:01:59.219> I<00:01:59.369> don't<00:01:59.490> know<00:01:59.549> what<00:01:59.670> I'm<00:01:59.729> saying

00:01:59.959 --> 00:01:59.969 
there was I don't know what I'm saying

00:01:59.969 --> 00:02:01.670 
there was I don't know what I'm saying
maybe<00:02:00.060> it's<00:02:00.270> one<00:02:00.420> of<00:02:00.509> the<00:02:00.570> cards<00:02:00.840> but<00:02:01.380> usually

00:02:01.670 --> 00:02:01.680 
maybe it's one of the cards but usually

00:02:01.680 --> 00:02:03.859 
maybe it's one of the cards but usually
there<00:02:01.829> is<00:02:01.860> Sam<00:02:02.250> texts<00:02:02.670> all<00:02:02.820> the<00:02:02.969> time<00:02:03.210> good<00:02:03.719> to

00:02:03.859 --> 00:02:03.869 
there is Sam texts all the time good to

00:02:03.869 --> 00:02:05.690 
there is Sam texts all the time good to
see<00:02:03.990> it<00:02:04.110> come<00:02:04.320> back<00:02:04.530> and<00:02:04.770> basically<00:02:05.430> that's

00:02:05.690 --> 00:02:05.700 
see it come back and basically that's

00:02:05.700 --> 00:02:06.859 
see it come back and basically that's
what<00:02:05.820> it's<00:02:06.000> going<00:02:06.119> to<00:02:06.180> do<00:02:06.299> so<00:02:06.450> it<00:02:06.540> actually<00:02:06.659> is

00:02:06.859 --> 00:02:06.869 
what it's going to do so it actually is

00:02:06.869 --> 00:02:08.449 
what it's going to do so it actually is
an<00:02:07.020> advanced<00:02:07.380> warfare<00:02:07.860> I'm<00:02:08.009> pretty<00:02:08.310> sure

00:02:08.449 --> 00:02:08.459 
an advanced warfare I'm pretty sure

00:02:08.459 --> 00:02:09.889 
an advanced warfare I'm pretty sure
that's<00:02:08.640> the<00:02:08.729> game<00:02:08.879> I<00:02:08.910> was<00:02:09.060> thinking<00:02:09.360> about<00:02:09.569> are

00:02:09.889 --> 00:02:09.899 
that's the game I was thinking about are

00:02:09.899 --> 00:02:11.869 
that's the game I was thinking about are
so<00:02:10.140> yeah<00:02:10.289> looks<00:02:10.530> like<00:02:10.590> an<00:02:10.770> avocado<00:02:10.860> good<00:02:11.580> stuff

00:02:11.869 --> 00:02:11.879 
so yeah looks like an avocado good stuff

00:02:11.879 --> 00:02:12.620 
so yeah looks like an avocado good stuff
the<00:02:12.270> next

00:02:12.620 --> 00:02:12.630 
the next

00:02:12.630 --> 00:02:13.940 
the next
something<00:02:12.960> a<00:02:13.020> little<00:02:13.230> bit<00:02:13.440> different<00:02:13.830> and

00:02:13.940 --> 00:02:13.950 
something a little bit different and

00:02:13.950 --> 00:02:15.590 
something a little bit different and
that<00:02:14.100> is<00:02:14.190> the<00:02:14.340> thermite<00:02:14.850> so<00:02:15.060> what<00:02:15.180> it<00:02:15.270> says<00:02:15.450> is

00:02:15.590 --> 00:02:15.600 
that is the thermite so what it says is

00:02:15.600 --> 00:02:17.990 
that is the thermite so what it says is
a<00:02:15.630> grenade<00:02:16.020> that<00:02:16.140> explodes<00:02:16.620> in<00:02:16.800> a<00:02:17.010> lethal<00:02:17.490> heat

00:02:17.990 --> 00:02:18.000 
a grenade that explodes in a lethal heat

00:02:18.000 --> 00:02:20.660 
a grenade that explodes in a lethal heat
zone<00:02:18.420> that<00:02:18.870> lasts<00:02:19.140> for<00:02:19.380> a<00:02:19.440> short<00:02:19.470> duration<00:02:20.070> of

00:02:20.660 --> 00:02:20.670 
zone that lasts for a short duration of

00:02:20.670 --> 00:02:23.030 
zone that lasts for a short duration of
time<00:02:21.030> so<00:02:21.390> basically<00:02:21.960> it's<00:02:22.140> like<00:02:22.320> a<00:02:22.350> Molotov

00:02:23.030 --> 00:02:23.040 
time so basically it's like a Molotov

00:02:23.040 --> 00:02:24.650 
time so basically it's like a Molotov
cocktail<00:02:23.070> that<00:02:23.820> you<00:02:23.940> throw<00:02:24.210> down<00:02:24.450> and

00:02:24.650 --> 00:02:24.660 
cocktail that you throw down and

00:02:24.660 --> 00:02:27.080 
cocktail that you throw down and
basically<00:02:25.440> as<00:02:25.680> it<00:02:25.830> says<00:02:26.010> a<00:02:26.190> lethal<00:02:26.580> heat<00:02:26.790> zone

00:02:27.080 --> 00:02:27.090 
basically as it says a lethal heat zone

00:02:27.090 --> 00:02:28.550 
basically as it says a lethal heat zone
so<00:02:27.360> if<00:02:27.420> someone<00:02:27.600> steps<00:02:27.810> on<00:02:27.960> that<00:02:27.990> area<00:02:28.320> it's

00:02:28.550 --> 00:02:28.560 
so if someone steps on that area it's

00:02:28.560 --> 00:02:30.380 
so if someone steps on that area it's
kind<00:02:28.920> of<00:02:28.950> like<00:02:29.040> a<00:02:29.130> gas<00:02:29.370> grenade<00:02:29.760> and<00:02:29.910> after<00:02:30.360> a

00:02:30.380 --> 00:02:30.390 
kind of like a gas grenade and after a

00:02:30.390 --> 00:02:31.490 
kind of like a gas grenade and after a
while<00:02:30.480> they're<00:02:30.660> going<00:02:30.720> to<00:02:30.840> be<00:02:30.900> losing<00:02:31.260> health

00:02:31.490 --> 00:02:31.500 
while they're going to be losing health

00:02:31.500 --> 00:02:32.300 
while they're going to be losing health
so<00:02:31.650> there's<00:02:31.800> something<00:02:31.950> a<00:02:32.040> little<00:02:32.070> bit

00:02:32.300 --> 00:02:32.310 
so there's something a little bit

00:02:32.310 --> 00:02:33.740 
so there's something a little bit
interesting<00:02:32.820> and<00:02:33.000> possibly<00:02:33.420> the<00:02:33.720> most

00:02:33.740 --> 00:02:33.750 
interesting and possibly the most

00:02:33.750 --> 00:02:36.380 
interesting and possibly the most
interesting<00:02:34.650> lethal<00:02:35.070> on<00:02:35.220> this<00:02:35.610> it<00:02:35.940> has<00:02:36.150> to<00:02:36.360> be

00:02:36.380 --> 00:02:36.390 
interesting lethal on this it has to be

00:02:36.390 --> 00:02:38.360 
interesting lethal on this it has to be
the<00:02:36.600> c-4<00:02:37.080> because<00:02:37.260> they<00:02:37.410> totally<00:02:37.980> changed

00:02:38.360 --> 00:02:38.370 
the c-4 because they totally changed

00:02:38.370 --> 00:02:39.890 
the c-4 because they totally changed
everything<00:02:38.820> about<00:02:38.880> it<00:02:39.240> so<00:02:39.330> as<00:02:39.480> you<00:02:39.600> can<00:02:39.690> see

00:02:39.890 --> 00:02:39.900 
everything about it so as you can see

00:02:39.900 --> 00:02:42.740 
everything about it so as you can see
it's<00:02:40.140> a<00:02:40.500> plastic<00:02:41.010> explosive<00:02:41.730> device<00:02:42.120> that<00:02:42.570> is

00:02:42.740 --> 00:02:42.750 
it's a plastic explosive device that is

00:02:42.750 --> 00:02:44.720 
it's a plastic explosive device that is
detonated<00:02:43.050> by<00:02:43.500> double-tapping<00:02:43.890> square<00:02:44.550> or

00:02:44.720 --> 00:02:44.730 
detonated by double-tapping square or

00:02:44.730 --> 00:02:47.060 
detonated by double-tapping square or
pressing<00:02:45.120> r1<00:02:45.510> equipped<00:02:46.440> with<00:02:46.530> a<00:02:46.620> proximity

00:02:47.060 --> 00:02:47.070 
pressing r1 equipped with a proximity

00:02:47.070 --> 00:02:49.250 
pressing r1 equipped with a proximity
alarm<00:02:47.460> that<00:02:47.670> notifies<00:02:47.700> the<00:02:48.570> notifies<00:02:48.960> player

00:02:49.250 --> 00:02:49.260 
alarm that notifies the notifies player

00:02:49.260 --> 00:02:51.320 
alarm that notifies the notifies player
wininet<00:02:49.680> when<00:02:49.920> an<00:02:50.040> enemy<00:02:50.220> is<00:02:50.580> near<00:02:50.850> the<00:02:50.970> device

you're<00:02:54.870> near<00:02:55.230> an<00:02:55.350> enemy<00:02:55.800> c4<00:02:56.310> and<00:02:56.370> it<00:02:56.430> gives<00:02:56.610> out

00:02:56.780 --> 00:02:56.790 
you're near an enemy c4 and it gives out

not<00:03:01.200> only<00:03:01.410> that<00:03:01.530> but<00:03:01.980> you<00:03:02.520> can't<00:03:02.820> throw<00:03:03.240> c4<00:03:03.780> in

00:03:03.860 --> 00:03:03.870 
not only that but you can't throw c4 in

00:03:03.870 --> 00:03:05.480 
not only that but you can't throw c4 in
the<00:03:03.960> air<00:03:04.080> and<00:03:04.410> blow<00:03:04.620> it<00:03:04.830> up<00:03:04.950> like<00:03:05.190> back<00:03:05.460> in

00:03:05.480 --> 00:03:05.490 
the air and blow it up like back in

00:03:05.490 --> 00:03:07.940 
the air and blow it up like back in
black<00:03:05.910> ops<00:03:06.150> 1<00:03:06.270> in<00:03:06.540> black<00:03:06.780> ops<00:03:06.990> 2<00:03:07.140> it<00:03:07.530> actually

00:03:07.940 --> 00:03:07.950 
black ops 1 in black ops 2 it actually

00:03:07.950 --> 00:03:09.920 
black ops 1 in black ops 2 it actually
has<00:03:08.310> to<00:03:08.520> touch<00:03:08.760> the<00:03:09.000> ground<00:03:09.240> for<00:03:09.570> it<00:03:09.630> to<00:03:09.780> blow

00:03:09.920 --> 00:03:09.930 
has to touch the ground for it to blow

00:03:09.930 --> 00:03:11.270 
has to touch the ground for it to blow
up<00:03:10.140> so<00:03:10.530> there's<00:03:10.710> not<00:03:10.800> going<00:03:10.920> to<00:03:10.980> be<00:03:11.040> too<00:03:11.250> much

00:03:11.270 --> 00:03:11.280

00:03:20.630 --> 00:03:20.640 
love doing that so it actually has to

00:03:20.640 --> 00:03:22.100 
love doing that so it actually has to
touch<00:03:20.850> the<00:03:21.000> ground<00:03:21.150> this<00:03:21.330> time<00:03:21.390> which<00:03:21.930> isn't

00:03:22.100 --> 00:03:22.110 
touch the ground this time which isn't

00:03:22.110 --> 00:03:24.260 
touch the ground this time which isn't
too<00:03:22.350> much<00:03:22.500> a<00:03:22.560> bit<00:03:23.040> of<00:03:23.190> a<00:03:23.250> biggie<00:03:23.580> but<00:03:23.820> usually

00:03:24.260 --> 00:03:24.270 
too much a bit of a biggie but usually

00:03:24.270 --> 00:03:26.210 
too much a bit of a biggie but usually
you<00:03:24.390> might<00:03:24.750> not<00:03:25.110> be<00:03:25.350> able<00:03:25.440> to<00:03:25.710> kill<00:03:25.920> them<00:03:26.070> but

00:03:26.210 --> 00:03:26.220 
you might not be able to kill them but

00:03:26.220 --> 00:03:27.770 
you might not be able to kill them but
you<00:03:26.340> still<00:03:26.550> might<00:03:26.760> be<00:03:26.910> able<00:03:27.000> to<00:03:27.270> damage<00:03:27.480> as

00:03:27.770 --> 00:03:27.780 
you still might be able to damage as

00:03:27.780 --> 00:03:30.290 
you still might be able to damage as
much<00:03:28.050> health<00:03:28.320> of<00:03:28.470> them<00:03:28.650> as<00:03:28.820> possible<00:03:29.820> the<00:03:30.090> next

00:03:30.290 --> 00:03:30.300 
much health of them as possible the next

00:03:30.300 --> 00:03:32.120 
much health of them as possible the next
thing<00:03:30.420> is<00:03:30.540> going<00:03:31.110> to<00:03:31.230> be<00:03:31.320> a<00:03:31.350> trip<00:03:31.680> mine<00:03:31.920> and

00:03:32.120 --> 00:03:32.130 
thing is going to be a trip mine and

00:03:32.130 --> 00:03:33.770 
thing is going to be a trip mine and
basically<00:03:32.640> what<00:03:33.090> this<00:03:33.240> thing<00:03:33.450> is<00:03:33.480> is<00:03:33.750> a

00:03:33.770 --> 00:03:33.780 
basically what this thing is is a

00:03:33.780 --> 00:03:35.780 
basically what this thing is is a
bouncing<00:03:34.230> betty<00:03:34.380> more<00:03:34.680> or<00:03:34.770> less<00:03:34.890> so<00:03:35.070> proximity

00:03:35.780 --> 00:03:35.790 
bouncing betty more or less so proximity

00:03:35.790 --> 00:03:37.520 
bouncing betty more or less so proximity
mine<00:03:36.000> that<00:03:36.390> launches<00:03:36.810> into<00:03:36.990> the<00:03:37.170> air<00:03:37.320> before

00:03:37.520 --> 00:03:37.530 
mine that launches into the air before

00:03:37.530 --> 00:03:39.740 
mine that launches into the air before
detonating<00:03:38.340> so<00:03:38.640> once<00:03:38.880> again<00:03:39.030> it<00:03:39.270> is<00:03:39.420> basically

00:03:39.740 --> 00:03:39.750 
detonating so once again it is basically

00:03:39.750 --> 00:03:41.480 
detonating so once again it is basically
like<00:03:39.900> a<00:03:39.990> bouncing<00:03:40.410> betty<00:03:40.560> i'm<00:03:40.830> going<00:03:41.310> to

00:03:41.480 --> 00:03:41.490 
like a bouncing betty i'm going to

00:03:41.490 --> 00:03:43.100 
like a bouncing betty i'm going to
assume<00:03:41.610> that<00:03:42.000> if<00:03:42.120> you<00:03:42.240> prune<00:03:42.510> down<00:03:42.840> you

00:03:43.100 --> 00:03:43.110 
assume that if you prune down you

00:03:43.110 --> 00:03:45.380 
assume that if you prune down you
wouldn't<00:03:43.530> be<00:03:44.160> able<00:03:44.310> to<00:03:44.580> dial<00:03:44.880> something<00:03:45.209> like

00:03:45.380 --> 00:03:45.390 
wouldn't be able to dial something like

00:03:45.390 --> 00:03:46.580 
wouldn't be able to dial something like
that<00:03:45.570> so<00:03:45.720> it's<00:03:45.870> gonna<00:03:45.959> be<00:03:46.020> pretty<00:03:46.170> interesting

00:03:46.580 --> 00:03:46.590 
that so it's gonna be pretty interesting

00:03:46.590 --> 00:03:47.600 
that so it's gonna be pretty interesting
the<00:03:46.650> next<00:03:46.830> thing<00:03:46.950> as<00:03:47.040> the<00:03:47.130> combat<00:03:47.459> axe

00:03:47.600 --> 00:03:47.610 
the next thing as the combat axe

00:03:47.610 --> 00:03:50.480 
the next thing as the combat axe
tomahawk<00:03:48.120> is<00:03:48.300> back<00:03:48.780> baby<00:03:49.080> yes<00:03:49.560> combat<00:03:50.280> axe

00:04:15.140 --> 00:04:15.150 
about that are the next thing which is

00:04:15.150 --> 00:04:16.610 
about that are the next thing which is
going<00:04:15.240> to<00:04:15.300> be<00:04:15.390> interesting<00:04:15.660> is<00:04:16.080> the<00:04:16.290> smoke

00:04:16.610 --> 00:04:16.620 
going to be interesting is the smoke

00:04:16.620 --> 00:04:18.710 
going to be interesting is the smoke
screen<00:04:17.040> and<00:04:17.250> what<00:04:17.580> it<00:04:17.700> does<00:04:17.730> is<00:04:17.910> it<00:04:18.060> produces<00:04:18.690> a

00:04:18.710 --> 00:04:18.720 
screen and what it does is it produces a

00:04:18.720 --> 00:04:21.140 
screen and what it does is it produces a
smoke<00:04:19.230> screen<00:04:19.410> upon<00:04:19.950> impact<00:04:20.459> allies<00:04:20.940> within

smoke screen upon impact allies within

00:04:21.150 --> 00:04:22.820 
smoke screen upon impact allies within
the<00:04:21.330> smoke<00:04:21.570> cannot<00:04:21.930> be<00:04:22.080> detected<00:04:22.350> on<00:04:22.710> the

00:04:22.820 --> 00:04:22.830 
the smoke cannot be detected on the

00:04:22.830 --> 00:04:24.390 
the smoke cannot be detected on the
enemy<00:04:23.010> mini-map<00:04:23.640> so<00:04:23.850> soon<00:04:24.060> as<00:04:24.150> you

00:04:24.390 --> 00:04:24.400 
enemy mini-map so soon as you

00:04:24.400 --> 00:04:26.100 
enemy mini-map so soon as you
really<00:04:24.550> smoke<00:04:24.820> grenade<00:04:25.090> you<00:04:25.630> won't<00:04:25.780> be<00:04:25.960> able

00:04:26.100 --> 00:04:26.110 
really smoke grenade you won't be able

00:04:26.110 --> 00:04:27.629 
really smoke grenade you won't be able
to<00:04:26.350> be<00:04:26.470> on<00:04:26.560> the<00:04:26.650> mini-map<00:04:26.889> which<00:04:27.190> I<00:04:27.370> find

00:04:27.629 --> 00:04:27.639 
to be on the mini-map which I find

00:04:27.639 --> 00:04:30.240 
to be on the mini-map which I find
awesomely<00:04:28.449> insane<00:04:28.990> because<00:04:29.830> usually<00:04:29.979> in

00:04:30.240 --> 00:04:30.250 
awesomely insane because usually in

00:04:30.250 --> 00:04:31.710 
awesomely insane because usually in
Search<00:04:30.460> and<00:04:30.580> Destroy<00:04:30.610> I<00:04:31.030> use<00:04:31.300> this<00:04:31.449> thing<00:04:31.690> a

00:04:31.710 --> 00:04:31.720 
Search and Destroy I use this thing a

00:04:31.720 --> 00:04:33.330 
Search and Destroy I use this thing a
lot<00:04:31.990> and<00:04:32.229> if<00:04:32.650> you're<00:04:32.770> not<00:04:32.860> on<00:04:33.009> the<00:04:33.100> mini-map

00:04:33.330 --> 00:04:33.340 
lot and if you're not on the mini-map

00:04:33.340 --> 00:04:35.040 
lot and if you're not on the mini-map
when<00:04:33.610> using<00:04:34.000> and<00:04:34.120> the<00:04:34.180> man<00:04:34.330> is<00:04:34.479> pretty<00:04:34.720> sweet

00:04:35.040 --> 00:04:35.050 
when using and the man is pretty sweet

00:04:35.050 --> 00:04:36.600 
when using and the man is pretty sweet
but<00:04:35.680> as<00:04:35.800> you<00:04:35.889> can<00:04:35.949> tell<00:04:36.009> it's<00:04:36.220> obviously<00:04:36.460> the

00:04:36.600 --> 00:04:36.610 
but as you can tell it's obviously the

00:04:36.610 --> 00:04:38.159 
but as you can tell it's obviously the
flashbang<00:04:37.090> the<00:04:37.210> a.m<00:04:37.389> people<00:04:37.810> we<00:04:37.900> don't<00:04:37.990> need

00:04:38.159 --> 00:04:38.169 
flashbang the a.m people we don't need

00:04:38.169 --> 00:04:39.570 
flashbang the a.m people we don't need
to<00:04:38.229> go<00:04:38.320> into<00:04:38.500> too<00:04:38.740> much<00:04:38.770> detail<00:04:38.949> because<00:04:39.370> it's

00:04:39.570 --> 00:04:39.580 
to go into too much detail because it's

00:04:39.580 --> 00:04:41.159 
to go into too much detail because it's
pretty<00:04:39.729> obvious<00:04:40.060> what<00:04:40.210> it<00:04:40.300> is<00:04:40.509> the<00:04:40.900> next<00:04:41.080> thing

00:04:41.159 --> 00:04:41.169 
pretty obvious what it is the next thing

00:04:41.169 --> 00:04:42.659 
pretty obvious what it is the next thing
is<00:04:41.229> the<00:04:41.410> trophy<00:04:41.650> system<00:04:42.160> now<00:04:42.310> this<00:04:42.430> one's<00:04:42.580> a

00:04:42.659 --> 00:04:42.669 
is the trophy system now this one's a

00:04:42.669 --> 00:04:43.860 
is the trophy system now this one's a
little<00:04:42.759> bit<00:04:42.970> different<00:04:43.360> it<00:04:43.449> destroys

00:04:43.860 --> 00:04:43.870 
little bit different it destroys

00:04:43.870 --> 00:04:45.779 
little bit different it destroys
incoming<00:04:44.470> enemy<00:04:44.740> an<00:04:44.860> enemy<00:04:45.250> projectiles

00:04:45.779 --> 00:04:45.789 
incoming enemy an enemy projectiles

00:04:45.789 --> 00:04:48.990 
incoming enemy an enemy projectiles
within<00:04:46.509> 10<00:04:46.750> meters<00:04:46.900> vehicle<00:04:47.889> missiles<00:04:48.669> have<00:04:48.970> a

00:04:48.990 --> 00:04:49.000 
within 10 meters vehicle missiles have a

00:04:49.000 --> 00:04:51.060 
within 10 meters vehicle missiles have a
chance<00:04:49.479> to<00:04:49.660> penetrate<00:04:50.199> so<00:04:50.620> as<00:04:50.830> you<00:04:50.860> can<00:04:51.009> tell

00:04:51.060 --> 00:04:51.070 
chance to penetrate so as you can tell

00:04:51.070 --> 00:04:53.040 
chance to penetrate so as you can tell
just<00:04:51.250> a<00:04:51.490> basic<00:04:51.729> trophy<00:04:52.270> system<00:04:52.600> except

00:04:53.040 --> 00:04:53.050 
just a basic trophy system except

00:04:53.050 --> 00:04:54.870 
just a basic trophy system except
obviously<00:04:53.250> destroys<00:04:54.250> enemy<00:04:54.580> incoming

00:04:54.870 --> 00:04:54.880 
obviously destroys enemy incoming

00:04:54.880 --> 00:04:57.150 
obviously destroys enemy incoming
projectiles<00:04:55.449> within<00:04:55.720> 10<00:04:55.960> meters<00:04:56.169> and<00:04:56.530> vehicle

00:04:57.150 --> 00:04:57.160 
projectiles within 10 meters and vehicle

00:04:57.160 --> 00:04:58.920 
projectiles within 10 meters and vehicle
missiles<00:04:57.520> have<00:04:57.699> a<00:04:57.729> chance<00:04:58.060> to<00:04:58.240> penetrate<00:04:58.720> so

00:04:58.920 --> 00:04:58.930 
missiles have a chance to penetrate so

00:04:58.930 --> 00:05:00.270 
missiles have a chance to penetrate so
obviously<00:04:59.470> if<00:04:59.620> it's<00:04:59.740> like<00:04:59.830> a<00:04:59.889> stingray

00:05:00.270 --> 00:05:00.280 
obviously if it's like a stingray

00:05:00.280 --> 00:05:02.400 
obviously if it's like a stingray
something<00:05:00.639> it<00:05:00.789> can<00:05:00.940> actually<00:05:01.330> shoot<00:05:01.660> trophy

00:05:02.400 --> 00:05:02.410 
something it can actually shoot trophy

00:05:02.410 --> 00:05:03.480 
something it can actually shoot trophy
systems<00:05:02.800> now<00:05:02.919> which<00:05:03.070> is<00:05:03.190> a<00:05:03.220> little<00:05:03.340> bit

00:05:03.480 --> 00:05:03.490 
systems now which is a little bit

00:05:03.490 --> 00:05:04.650 
systems now which is a little bit
different<00:05:03.820> and<00:05:03.940> the<00:05:04.150> thing<00:05:04.270> that's<00:05:04.330> going<00:05:04.630> to

00:05:04.650 --> 00:05:04.660 
different and the thing that's going to

00:05:04.660 --> 00:05:06.600 
different and the thing that's going to
be<00:05:04.780> annoying<00:05:04.990> me<00:05:05.169> a<00:05:05.199> lot<00:05:05.470> has<00:05:05.889> to<00:05:06.130> be<00:05:06.250> the<00:05:06.370> shock

00:05:06.600 --> 00:05:06.610 
be annoying me a lot has to be the shock

00:05:06.610 --> 00:05:08.909 
be annoying me a lot has to be the shock
charge<00:05:06.910> because<00:05:07.150> this<00:05:07.330> thing<00:05:07.630> is<00:05:07.750> back<00:05:08.440> yes

00:05:10.350 --> 00:05:10.360 
this thing annoying me back in black ops

00:05:10.360 --> 00:05:12.029 
this thing annoying me back in black ops
2<00:05:10.479> hopefully<00:05:10.960> it<00:05:11.050> won't<00:05:11.229> annoy<00:05:11.410> me<00:05:11.560> that<00:05:11.770> much

00:05:12.029 --> 00:05:12.039 
2 hopefully it won't annoy me that much

00:05:12.039 --> 00:05:13.650 
2 hopefully it won't annoy me that much
and<00:05:12.280> as<00:05:12.760> you<00:05:12.880> can<00:05:13.000> see<00:05:13.030> it's<00:05:13.270> a<00:05:13.330> proximity

00:05:13.650 --> 00:05:13.660 
and as you can see it's a proximity

00:05:13.660 --> 00:05:15.810 
and as you can see it's a proximity
triggered<00:05:14.139> in<00:05:14.199> mind<00:05:14.440> that<00:05:14.889> electrocute<00:05:15.580> and

00:05:15.810 --> 00:05:15.820 
triggered in mind that electrocute and

00:05:15.820 --> 00:05:18.150 
triggered in mind that electrocute and
stuns<00:05:16.300> nearby<00:05:16.990> enemies<00:05:17.590> so<00:05:17.740> that's<00:05:17.919> going<00:05:18.070> to

00:05:18.150 --> 00:05:18.160 
stuns nearby enemies so that's going to

00:05:18.160 --> 00:05:19.680 
stuns nearby enemies so that's going to
annoy<00:05:18.310> me<00:05:18.460> a<00:05:18.490> lot<00:05:18.729> I'm<00:05:18.940> probably<00:05:19.360> gonna<00:05:19.539> have

00:05:19.680 --> 00:05:19.690 
annoy me a lot I'm probably gonna have

00:05:19.690 --> 00:05:21.120 
annoy me a lot I'm probably gonna have
to<00:05:19.780> put<00:05:19.960> that<00:05:20.110> perk<00:05:20.320> on<00:05:20.530> that's<00:05:20.710> probably

00:05:21.120 --> 00:05:21.130 
to put that perk on that's probably

00:05:21.130 --> 00:05:22.230 
to put that perk on that's probably
going<00:05:21.310> to<00:05:21.400> stop<00:05:21.639> that<00:05:21.760> thing<00:05:21.820> because<00:05:22.150> I've

00:05:22.230 --> 00:05:22.240 
going to stop that thing because I've

00:05:22.240 --> 00:05:23.279 
going to stop that thing because I've
got<00:05:22.330> a<00:05:22.360> feeling<00:05:22.539> a<00:05:22.750> lot<00:05:22.840> of<00:05:22.960> people<00:05:23.080> are<00:05:23.199> going

00:05:23.279 --> 00:05:23.289 
got a feeling a lot of people are going

00:05:23.289 --> 00:05:25.529 
got a feeling a lot of people are going
to<00:05:23.380> be<00:05:23.470> putting<00:05:23.740> like<00:05:23.979> 42<00:05:24.910> times<00:05:25.240> of<00:05:25.419> these

00:05:25.529 --> 00:05:25.539 
to be putting like 42 times of these

00:05:25.539 --> 00:05:27.300 
to be putting like 42 times of these
things<00:05:25.690> on<00:05:25.930> the<00:05:26.110> ground<00:05:26.229> I<00:05:26.470> can<00:05:26.680> just<00:05:26.710> feel<00:05:27.099> it

00:05:27.300 --> 00:05:27.310 
things on the ground I can just feel it

00:05:27.310 --> 00:05:28.740 
things on the ground I can just feel it
I'm<00:05:27.550> not<00:05:27.849> sure<00:05:27.910> exactly<00:05:28.389> what<00:05:28.599> they're

00:05:28.740 --> 00:05:28.750 
I'm not sure exactly what they're

00:05:28.750 --> 00:05:30.450 
I'm not sure exactly what they're
classified<00:05:29.169> tactical<00:05:29.889> is<00:05:29.979> but<00:05:30.160> I've<00:05:30.310> got<00:05:30.430> a

00:05:30.450 --> 00:05:30.460 
classified tactical is but I've got a

00:05:30.460 --> 00:05:32.370 
classified tactical is but I've got a
feeling<00:05:30.729> it's<00:05:31.000> one<00:05:31.510> of<00:05:31.599> those<00:05:31.660> grenade<00:05:32.080> things

00:05:32.370 --> 00:05:32.380 
feeling it's one of those grenade things

00:05:32.380 --> 00:05:34.200 
feeling it's one of those grenade things
in<00:05:32.620> advanced<00:05:33.010> warfare<00:05:33.520> or<00:05:33.729> it's<00:05:34.000> gonna<00:05:34.090> be

00:05:34.200 --> 00:05:34.210 
in advanced warfare or it's gonna be

00:05:34.210 --> 00:05:35.339 
in advanced warfare or it's gonna be
something<00:05:34.360> similar<00:05:34.750> to<00:05:34.780> that<00:05:34.900> we<00:05:35.199> can

00:05:35.339 --> 00:05:35.349 
something similar to that we can

00:05:35.349 --> 00:05:37.020 
something similar to that we can
actually<00:05:35.470> cycle<00:05:35.949> through<00:05:36.160> all<00:05:36.190> of<00:05:36.370> the

00:05:37.020 --> 00:05:37.030 
actually cycle through all of the

00:05:37.030 --> 00:05:39.060 
actually cycle through all of the
concussion<00:05:37.570> flashbang<00:05:38.020> EMP<00:05:38.530> and<00:05:38.650> smoke<00:05:38.889> and

concussion flashbang EMP and smoke and

00:05:39.070 --> 00:05:40.110 
concussion flashbang EMP and smoke and
throw<00:05:39.340> it<00:05:39.460> I'm<00:05:39.520> guessing<00:05:39.669> it's<00:05:39.880> going<00:05:40.000> to<00:05:40.060> be
