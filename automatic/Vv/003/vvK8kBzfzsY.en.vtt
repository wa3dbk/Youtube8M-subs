00:01:39.170 --> 00:01:39.180 
of the models they differ on how far

00:01:39.180 --> 00:01:40.670 
of the models they differ on how far
it's<00:01:39.390> gonna<00:01:39.450> move<00:01:39.930> off<00:01:40.140> here<00:01:40.350> towards<00:01:40.619> the

it's gonna move off here towards the

it's gonna move off here towards the

00:01:42.380 --> 00:01:42.390 
north and towards the south I think that

00:01:42.390 --> 00:01:45.469 
north and towards the south I think that
Okinawa<00:01:42.990> you're<00:01:43.829> going<00:01:44.220> to<00:01:44.340> miss<00:01:44.640> the<00:01:44.909> bulk<00:01:45.270> of

Japanese<00:02:37.680> islands<00:02:38.129> eastern<00:02:38.549> China<00:02:38.849> that's

00:02:39.140 --> 00:02:39.150 
Japanese islands eastern China that's

00:02:39.150 --> 00:02:40.670 
Japanese islands eastern China that's
still<00:02:39.390> in<00:02:39.510> place<00:02:39.810> it<00:02:40.019> just<00:02:40.049> lifted<00:02:40.590> a<00:02:40.650> little

00:02:40.670 --> 00:02:40.680 
still in place it just lifted a little

00:02:40.680 --> 00:02:42.710 
still in place it just lifted a little
farther<00:02:41.069> towards<00:02:41.430> the<00:02:41.489> north<00:02:41.670> that's<00:02:42.180> acting

00:02:42.710 --> 00:02:42.720 
farther towards the north that's acting

00:02:42.720 --> 00:02:44.360 
farther towards the north that's acting
like<00:02:42.870> a<00:02:42.959> wall<00:02:43.230> acting<00:02:43.650> like<00:02:43.799> a<00:02:43.829> buffer<00:02:44.220> and

00:02:44.360 --> 00:02:44.370 
like a wall acting like a buffer and

00:02:44.370 --> 00:02:46.309 
like a wall acting like a buffer and
that's<00:02:44.489> why<00:02:44.730> this<00:02:44.790> doesn't<00:02:45.209> just<00:02:45.599> go<00:02:45.810> looping

00:02:46.309 --> 00:02:46.319 
that's why this doesn't just go looping

00:02:46.319 --> 00:02:47.809 
that's why this doesn't just go looping
back<00:02:46.470> around<00:02:46.769> and<00:02:47.010> head<00:02:47.220> straight<00:02:47.549> off

00:02:47.809 --> 00:02:47.819 
back around and head straight off

00:02:47.819 --> 00:02:49.940 
back around and head straight off
towards<00:02:48.239> the<00:02:48.389> north<00:02:48.659> like<00:02:49.230> we<00:02:49.379> saw<00:02:49.560> with<00:02:49.739> a<00:02:49.769> lot

00:02:49.940 --> 00:02:49.950 
towards the north like we saw with a lot

00:02:49.950 --> 00:02:51.559 
towards the north like we saw with a lot
of<00:02:50.069> last<00:02:50.310> year's<00:02:50.639> storm<00:02:50.970> systems<00:02:51.389> it's

00:02:51.559 --> 00:02:51.569 
of last year's storm systems it's

00:02:51.569 --> 00:02:53.539 
of last year's storm systems it's
because<00:02:51.780> that<00:02:51.930> high-pressure<00:02:52.260> wall<00:02:52.950> is<00:02:53.250> just

00:02:53.539 --> 00:02:53.549 
because that high-pressure wall is just

00:02:53.549 --> 00:02:55.099 
because that high-pressure wall is just
still<00:02:53.760> in<00:02:53.940> place<00:02:54.209> there<00:02:54.510> now<00:02:54.720> as<00:02:54.810> far<00:02:54.959> as<00:02:55.019> a

00:03:10.490 --> 00:03:10.500 
south and that's why we're saying this

00:03:10.500 --> 00:03:12.679

is<00:03:10.590> gonna<00:03:10.680> be<00:03:10.859> a<00:03:10.889> big<00:03:11.040> Rainmaker<00:03:11.480> because<00:03:12.480> it

00:03:12.679 --> 00:03:12.689 
is gonna be a big Rainmaker because it

00:03:12.689 --> 00:03:14.809 
is gonna be a big Rainmaker because it
is<00:03:13.019> still<00:03:13.379> grabbing<00:03:13.680> all<00:03:14.010> this<00:03:14.189> monsoonal

removed from the Philippines you're
still<00:04:03.180> gonna<00:04:03.269> see<00:04:03.479> that<00:04:03.599> monsoonal<00:04:04.199> inflow<00:04:04.590> we

00:04:04.729 --> 00:04:04.739 
still gonna see that monsoonal inflow we

00:04:04.739 --> 00:04:06.649 
still gonna see that monsoonal inflow we
saw<00:04:04.889> that<00:04:05.040> last<00:04:05.250> year<00:04:05.549> one<00:04:05.790> particular<00:04:06.299> storm

00:04:06.649 --> 00:04:06.659 
saw that last year one particular storm

00:04:06.659 --> 00:04:08.210 
saw that last year one particular storm
that<00:04:06.810> caused<00:04:06.989> very<00:04:07.319> serious<00:04:07.769> flooding<00:04:08.129> in

00:04:08.210 --> 00:04:08.220 
that caused very serious flooding in

00:04:08.220 --> 00:04:11.000 
that caused very serious flooding in
Manila<00:04:08.549> so<00:04:09.030> uh<00:04:09.060> yeah<00:04:09.870> that<00:04:10.139> storm<00:04:10.440> system<00:04:10.829> is

00:04:11.000 --> 00:04:11.010 
Manila so uh yeah that storm system is

00:04:11.010 --> 00:04:12.710 
Manila so uh yeah that storm system is
really<00:04:11.280> going<00:04:11.489> to<00:04:11.579> be<00:04:11.699> putting<00:04:12.150> a<00:04:12.299> similar

00:04:12.710 --> 00:04:12.720 
really going to be putting a similar

00:04:12.720 --> 00:04:14.780 
really going to be putting a similar
output<00:04:12.930> as<00:04:13.290> that<00:04:13.500> just<00:04:13.859> because<00:04:14.159> I<00:04:14.370> mean<00:04:14.549> take

00:04:14.780 --> 00:04:14.790 
output as that just because I mean take

00:04:14.790 --> 00:04:16.430 
output as that just because I mean take
a<00:04:14.819> look<00:04:15.030> at<00:04:15.090> all<00:04:15.299> this<00:04:15.629> rainfall<00:04:16.139> all<00:04:16.260> this

00:04:16.430 --> 00:04:16.440 
a look at all this rainfall all this

00:04:16.440 --> 00:04:18.860 
a look at all this rainfall all this
moisture<00:04:16.799> that<00:04:17.190> is<00:04:17.340> this<00:04:17.609> de<00:04:18.120> propolis<00:04:18.539> storm

00:04:18.860 --> 00:04:18.870 
moisture that is this de propolis storm

00:04:18.870 --> 00:04:20.779 
moisture that is this de propolis storm
is<00:04:19.079> sucking<00:04:19.799> in<00:04:19.949> with<00:04:20.159> it<00:04:20.340> and<00:04:20.370> that's<00:04:20.519> just

00:04:20.779 --> 00:04:20.789 
is sucking in with it and that's just

00:04:20.789 --> 00:04:22.430 
is sucking in with it and that's just
going<00:04:20.880> to<00:04:20.940> continue<00:04:21.120> enhance<00:04:21.750> that<00:04:21.959> monsoonal

00:04:22.430 --> 00:04:22.440 
going to continue enhance that monsoonal

00:04:22.440 --> 00:04:25.399 
going to continue enhance that monsoonal
flow<00:04:22.500> now<00:04:23.130> into<00:04:23.580> the<00:04:23.669> forecast<00:04:24.150> um<00:04:24.510> do<00:04:24.990> expect

00:04:25.399 --> 00:04:25.409 
flow now into the forecast um do expect

00:04:25.409 --> 00:04:27.410 
flow now into the forecast um do expect
the<00:04:25.620> loop<00:04:25.770> around<00:04:25.919> now<00:04:26.340> as<00:04:26.550> far<00:04:26.849> as<00:04:26.909> the

00:04:27.410 --> 00:04:27.420 
the loop around now as far as the

00:04:27.420 --> 00:04:29.420 
the loop around now as far as the
density<00:04:27.720> a<00:04:27.810> lot<00:04:27.990> of<00:04:28.080> the<00:04:28.140> models<00:04:28.500> do<00:04:28.710> differ<00:04:29.070> on

00:04:29.420 --> 00:04:29.430 
density a lot of the models do differ on

00:04:29.430 --> 00:04:31.880 
density a lot of the models do differ on
it<00:04:29.640> I<00:04:29.820> do<00:04:30.270> think<00:04:30.540> that<00:04:30.960> it<00:04:31.290> is<00:04:31.410> going<00:04:31.620> to<00:04:31.710> stay

00:04:31.880 --> 00:04:31.890 
it I do think that it is going to stay

00:04:31.890 --> 00:04:34.940 
it I do think that it is going to stay
on<00:04:32.160> the<00:04:32.400> weaker<00:04:32.910> side<00:04:33.290> likely<00:04:34.290> more<00:04:34.500> along<00:04:34.770> the

00:04:34.940 --> 00:04:34.950 
on the weaker side likely more along the

00:04:34.950 --> 00:04:36.890 
on the weaker side likely more along the
lines<00:04:35.160> of<00:04:35.280> what<00:04:35.430> the<00:04:35.520> GFS<00:04:35.940> model<00:04:35.970> output<00:04:36.630> is<00:04:36.750> at

lines of what the GFS model output is at

00:04:36.900 --> 00:04:38.630

this time pulling off there towards the

00:04:41.580 --> 00:04:43.160 
pressure Ridge and starting to come back
towards<00:04:41.970> the<00:04:42.240> West<00:04:42.450> but<00:04:42.660> really<00:04:43.020> it<00:04:43.140> is

00:04:43.160 --> 00:04:43.170 
towards the West but really it is

00:04:43.170 --> 00:04:45.770 
towards the West but really it is
staying<00:04:43.620> on<00:04:43.830> the<00:04:43.980> the<00:04:44.280> weaker<00:04:44.670> side<00:04:44.880> as<00:04:45.210> far<00:04:45.540> as

00:04:45.770 --> 00:04:45.780 
staying on the the weaker side as far as

00:04:45.780 --> 00:04:47.150 
staying on the the weaker side as far as
the<00:04:45.930> winds<00:04:46.260> this<00:04:46.380> is<00:04:46.530> going<00:04:46.800> out<00:04:46.890> in<00:04:47.070> the

00:04:47.150 --> 00:04:47.160 
the winds this is going out in the

00:04:47.160 --> 00:04:49.430 
the winds this is going out in the
Tuesday<00:04:47.610> just<00:04:48.270> southwest<00:04:48.480> of<00:04:48.840> Okinawa<00:04:49.350> but

00:04:49.430 --> 00:04:49.440 
Tuesday just southwest of Okinawa but

00:04:49.440 --> 00:04:50.960 
Tuesday just southwest of Okinawa but
let's<00:04:49.590> blow<00:04:49.740> up<00:04:49.770> the<00:04:49.920> MSL<00:04:50.370> at<00:04:50.490> the<00:04:50.580> same<00:04:50.760> time

00:04:50.960 --> 00:04:50.970 
let's blow up the MSL at the same time

00:04:50.970 --> 00:04:52.820 
let's blow up the MSL at the same time
because<00:04:51.120> there<00:04:51.330> is<00:04:51.480> a<00:04:51.510> rain<00:04:51.870> field<00:04:52.200> on<00:04:52.470> this<00:04:52.650> it

00:04:52.820 --> 00:04:52.830 
because there is a rain field on this it

00:04:52.830 --> 00:04:54.290 
because there is a rain field on this it
does<00:04:52.950> extend<00:04:53.340> off<00:04:53.460> towards<00:04:53.820> the<00:04:53.850> north<00:04:54.060> and

00:04:54.290 --> 00:04:54.300 
does extend off towards the north and

00:04:54.300 --> 00:04:55.880 
does extend off towards the north and
doors<00:04:54.600> the<00:04:54.840> south<00:04:55.050> let<00:04:55.320> this<00:04:55.440> buffer<00:04:55.770> up

00:04:55.880 --> 00:04:55.890 
doors the south let this buffer up

00:04:55.890 --> 00:04:57.710 
doors the south let this buffer up
really<00:04:56.160> quick<00:04:56.340> for<00:04:56.580> you<00:04:56.700> and<00:04:57.060> you<00:04:57.420> can<00:04:57.540> see

00:04:57.710 --> 00:04:57.720 
really quick for you and you can see

00:04:57.720 --> 00:04:59.600 
really quick for you and you can see
these<00:04:57.870> showers<00:04:58.500> really<00:04:58.770> extending<00:04:59.340> off<00:04:59.490> in

00:04:59.600 --> 00:04:59.610 
these showers really extending off in

00:04:59.610 --> 00:05:00.950 
these showers really extending off in
those<00:04:59.700> directions<00:05:00.090> and<00:05:00.450> then<00:05:00.570> you<00:05:00.660> still<00:05:00.840> have

00:05:00.950 --> 00:05:00.960 
those directions and then you still have

00:05:00.960 --> 00:05:02.420 
those directions and then you still have
that<00:05:01.050> persistent<00:05:01.380> moisture<00:05:02.010> and<00:05:02.100> flow<00:05:02.280> down

00:05:02.420 --> 00:05:02.430 
that persistent moisture and flow down

00:05:02.430 --> 00:05:04.040 
that persistent moisture and flow down
across<00:05:02.790> northwestern<00:05:03.450> Luzon

00:05:04.040 --> 00:05:04.050 
across northwestern Luzon

00:05:04.050 --> 00:05:05.690 
across northwestern Luzon
so<00:05:04.500> with<00:05:04.620> that<00:05:04.740> side<00:05:04.950> a<00:05:04.980> buried<00:05:05.250> big<00:05:05.400> rain

00:05:05.690 --> 00:05:05.700 
so with that side a buried big rain

00:05:05.700 --> 00:05:08.630 
so with that side a buried big rain
filled<00:05:06.030> a<00:05:06.240> big<00:05:06.510> Rainmaker<00:05:07.130> as<00:05:08.130> far<00:05:08.430> as<00:05:08.520> the

00:05:08.630 --> 00:05:08.640 
filled a big Rainmaker as far as the

00:05:08.640 --> 00:05:10.400 
filled a big Rainmaker as far as the
winds<00:05:08.820> I<00:05:09.000> don't<00:05:09.270> see<00:05:09.570> it<00:05:09.720> I<00:05:09.780> think<00:05:10.020> this<00:05:10.140> was

00:05:10.400 --> 00:05:10.410 
winds I don't see it I think this was

00:05:10.410 --> 00:05:12.710 
winds I don't see it I think this was
going<00:05:10.590> to<00:05:10.740> play<00:05:10.920> out<00:05:11.100> but<00:05:11.130> um<00:05:11.670> as<00:05:12.240> far<00:05:12.480> as<00:05:12.630> a

00:05:12.710 --> 00:05:12.720 
going to play out but um as far as a

00:05:12.720 --> 00:05:15.620 
going to play out but um as far as a
track<00:05:13.020> with<00:05:13.890> a<00:05:14.130> JMA<00:05:14.640> they're<00:05:14.850> not<00:05:15.000> basing<00:05:15.480> so

00:05:15.620 --> 00:05:15.630 
track with a JMA they're not basing so

00:05:15.630 --> 00:05:17.240 
track with a JMA they're not basing so
much<00:05:15.810> on<00:05:15.930> the<00:05:16.020> intensity<00:05:16.590> but<00:05:16.890> they're<00:05:17.040> using

00:05:17.240 --> 00:05:17.250 
much on the intensity but they're using

00:05:17.250 --> 00:05:19.070 
much on the intensity but they're using
their<00:05:17.580> model<00:05:18.000> which<00:05:18.210> shows<00:05:18.240> this<00:05:18.750> type<00:05:19.020> of

00:05:19.070 --> 00:05:19.080 
their model which shows this type of

is the high-resolution JM a local model

00:05:30.090 --> 00:05:31.670 
is the high-resolution JM a local model
for<00:05:30.270> this<00:05:30.390> area<00:05:30.600> so<00:05:30.840> as<00:05:30.930> far<00:05:31.080> as<00:05:31.140> models<00:05:31.500> go

00:05:31.670 --> 00:05:31.680 
for this area so as far as models go

00:05:31.680 --> 00:05:33.410 
for this area so as far as models go
this<00:05:31.860> should<00:05:32.070> be<00:05:32.280> the<00:05:32.460> very<00:05:32.640> good<00:05:33.030> one<00:05:33.240> now

00:05:33.410 --> 00:05:33.420 
this should be the very good one now

00:05:33.420 --> 00:05:35.210 
this should be the very good one now
this<00:05:33.960> is<00:05:34.140> just<00:05:34.320> showing<00:05:34.470> you<00:05:34.740> the<00:05:34.890> wave

00:05:35.210 --> 00:05:35.220 
this is just showing you the wave

00:05:35.220 --> 00:05:37.940 
this is just showing you the wave
forecast<00:05:36.060> for<00:05:36.450> basically<00:05:37.140> Wednesday<00:05:37.830> I'll

forecast for basically Wednesday I'll
even<00:05:38.220> scroll<00:05:38.460> it<00:05:38.580> back<00:05:38.730> here<00:05:38.970> till<00:05:39.180> Tuesday

00:05:39.800 --> 00:05:39.810 
even scroll it back here till Tuesday

00:05:39.810 --> 00:05:41.600 
even scroll it back here till Tuesday
would<00:05:40.230> you<00:05:40.350> see<00:05:40.530> some<00:05:40.740> very<00:05:40.920> intense<00:05:41.280> and<00:05:41.490> high

00:05:41.600 --> 00:05:41.610 
would you see some very intense and high

00:05:41.610 --> 00:05:43.250 
would you see some very intense and high
waves<00:05:41.910> along<00:05:42.300> the<00:05:42.480> eastern<00:05:42.810> periphery<00:05:43.050> of

00:05:43.250 --> 00:05:43.260 
waves along the eastern periphery of

00:05:43.260 --> 00:05:45.260 
waves along the eastern periphery of
that<00:05:43.380> center<00:05:43.590> of<00:05:43.650> circulation<00:05:44.180> smacking<00:05:45.180> you

00:05:45.260 --> 00:05:45.270 
that center of circulation smacking you

00:05:45.270 --> 00:05:46.850 
that center of circulation smacking you
here<00:05:45.510> into<00:05:45.690> the<00:05:45.750> southern<00:05:46.050> Japanese<00:05:46.500> islands

00:05:46.850 --> 00:05:46.860 
here into the southern Japanese islands

00:05:46.860 --> 00:05:48.950 
here into the southern Japanese islands
up<00:05:47.220> to<00:05:47.370> about<00:05:47.520> 5<00:05:47.730> meters<00:05:48.120> high<00:05:48.300> in<00:05:48.360> a<00:05:48.540> few<00:05:48.750> areas

00:05:48.950 --> 00:05:48.960 
up to about 5 meters high in a few areas

00:05:48.960 --> 00:05:50.390 
up to about 5 meters high in a few areas
so<00:05:49.260> that's<00:05:49.380> going<00:05:49.530> to<00:05:49.590> be<00:05:49.680> some<00:05:49.920> very<00:05:50.130> rough

00:05:50.390 --> 00:05:50.400 
so that's going to be some very rough

00:05:50.400 --> 00:05:52.340 
so that's going to be some very rough
seas<00:05:50.730> by<00:05:51.000> Tuesday<00:05:51.660> in<00:05:51.810> the<00:05:51.900> Wednesday

venturing out to the beach out here a
very<00:05:55.650> dangerous<00:05:56.180> chance<00:05:57.180> of<00:05:57.360> rip<00:05:57.540> currents

00:05:57.920 --> 00:05:57.930 
very dangerous chance of rip currents

00:05:57.930 --> 00:05:59.090 
very dangerous chance of rip currents
plus<00:05:58.380> you're<00:05:58.530> gonna<00:05:58.620> be<00:05:58.740> having<00:05:58.920> these

you get these waves really high and too
choppy<00:06:05.540> surfing<00:06:06.540> kind<00:06:06.840> of<00:06:06.990> it's<00:06:07.770> not<00:06:07.830> even<00:06:07.980> fun

00:06:08.450 --> 00:06:08.460 
choppy surfing kind of it's not even fun

00:06:08.460 --> 00:06:09.920 
choppy surfing kind of it's not even fun
anymore<00:06:08.490> but<00:06:09.090> this<00:06:09.210> is<00:06:09.360> looking<00:06:09.480> at<00:06:09.750> and<00:06:09.870> the
