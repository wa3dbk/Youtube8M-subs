okay now I'm going to come through and

00:01:00.629 --> 00:01:02.209 
okay now I'm going to come through and

I'm not actually going to cut I'm just
using<00:01:02.399> her<00:01:02.640> as<00:01:02.789> a<00:01:02.820> demo<00:01:03.210> in<00:01:03.359> terms<00:01:03.539> of<00:01:03.690> the

00:01:03.740 --> 00:01:03.750 
using her as a demo in terms of the

00:01:03.750 --> 00:01:04.880 
using her as a demo in terms of the
mechanics<00:01:04.199> so<00:01:04.290> let's<00:01:04.470> make<00:01:04.619> sure<00:01:04.650> you

00:01:04.880 --> 00:01:04.890 
mechanics so let's make sure you

00:01:04.890 --> 00:01:06.830 
mechanics so let's make sure you
understand<00:01:05.309> that<00:01:05.369> but<00:01:06.060> here's<00:01:06.270> what<00:01:06.450> happens

00:01:06.830 --> 00:01:06.840 
understand that but here's what happens

00:01:06.840 --> 00:01:08.690 
understand that but here's what happens
when<00:01:07.049> you<00:01:07.619> come<00:01:07.860> through<00:01:08.040> and<00:01:08.220> you<00:01:08.280> try<00:01:08.460> to<00:01:08.490> do

00:01:08.690 --> 00:01:08.700 
when you come through and you try to do

00:01:08.700 --> 00:01:10.340 
when you come through and you try to do
this<00:01:08.939> and<00:01:09.180> you<00:01:09.240> try<00:01:09.420> to<00:01:09.479> just<00:01:09.720> carve<00:01:10.020> it<00:01:10.170> out

00:01:10.340 --> 00:01:10.350 
this and you try to just carve it out

00:01:10.350 --> 00:01:12.679 
this and you try to just carve it out
the<00:01:10.890> hair<00:01:11.100> moves<00:01:11.400> and<00:01:11.820> it<00:01:11.970> moves<00:01:12.330> away<00:01:12.540> from

00:01:12.679 --> 00:01:12.689 
the hair moves and it moves away from

00:01:12.689 --> 00:01:14.450 
the hair moves and it moves away from
you<00:01:12.990> so<00:01:13.439> that<00:01:13.470> has<00:01:13.770> a<00:01:13.799> natural<00:01:14.189> common

00:01:14.450 --> 00:01:14.460 
you so that has a natural common

00:01:14.460 --> 00:01:15.830 
you so that has a natural common
tendency<00:01:14.820> to<00:01:14.909> make<00:01:15.060> it<00:01:15.210> choppy

00:01:15.830 --> 00:01:15.840 
tendency to make it choppy

00:01:15.840 --> 00:01:18.080 
tendency to make it choppy
especially<00:01:16.290> on<00:01:16.380> the<00:01:16.500> edge<00:01:16.680> okay<00:01:17.430> so<00:01:17.880> what<00:01:18.030> you

00:01:18.080 --> 00:01:18.090 
especially on the edge okay so what you

00:01:18.090 --> 00:01:19.490 
especially on the edge okay so what you
want<00:01:18.240> to<00:01:18.299> do<00:01:18.390> is<00:01:18.509> you<00:01:18.600> want<00:01:18.750> to<00:01:18.810> capture<00:01:19.020> it<00:01:19.290> and

00:01:19.490 --> 00:01:19.500 
want to do is you want to capture it and

00:01:19.500 --> 00:01:21.020 
want to do is you want to capture it and
then<00:01:19.740> you<00:01:19.830> want<00:01:19.979> to<00:01:20.009> work<00:01:20.189> with<00:01:20.400> a<00:01:20.430> deep<00:01:20.729> part

00:01:21.020 --> 00:01:21.030 
then you want to work with a deep part

00:01:21.030 --> 00:01:23.270 
then you want to work with a deep part
of<00:01:21.210> this<00:01:21.840> shear<00:01:22.320> watch<00:01:22.890> what<00:01:23.040> we're<00:01:23.130> going<00:01:23.250> to

00:01:23.270 --> 00:01:23.280 
of this shear watch what we're going to

00:01:23.280 --> 00:01:25.789 
of this shear watch what we're going to
do<00:01:23.400> all<00:01:23.939> I<00:01:24.000> do<00:01:24.180> is<00:01:24.390> just<00:01:24.420> take<00:01:24.750> it<00:01:24.930> I<00:01:25.049> fold<00:01:25.530> the

00:01:25.789 --> 00:01:25.799 
do all I do is just take it I fold the

00:01:25.799 --> 00:01:27.530 
do all I do is just take it I fold the
ear<00:01:26.009> so<00:01:26.310> can<00:01:26.490> you<00:01:26.610> see<00:01:26.820> how<00:01:26.850> I'm<00:01:27.030> folding<00:01:27.270> the

00:01:27.530 --> 00:01:27.540 
ear so can you see how I'm folding the

00:01:27.540 --> 00:01:30.140 
ear so can you see how I'm folding the
ear<00:01:27.750> once<00:01:28.409> I<00:01:28.619> fold<00:01:28.920> the<00:01:29.100> ear<00:01:29.340> the<00:01:29.820> hair<00:01:30.030> is

00:01:30.140 --> 00:01:30.150 
ear once I fold the ear the hair is

00:01:30.150 --> 00:01:32.899 
ear once I fold the ear the hair is
captured<00:01:30.720> inside<00:01:30.869> the<00:01:31.680> shear<00:01:31.979> goes<00:01:32.280> in<00:01:32.700> and

00:01:32.899 --> 00:01:32.909 
captured inside the shear goes in and

00:01:32.909 --> 00:01:34.490 
captured inside the shear goes in and
now<00:01:33.090> I'm<00:01:33.270> going<00:01:33.420> to<00:01:33.509> do<00:01:33.630> all<00:01:33.659> I<00:01:33.900> do<00:01:34.049> is<00:01:34.259> place

00:01:34.490 --> 00:01:34.500 
now I'm going to do all I do is place

00:01:34.500 --> 00:01:36.770 
now I'm going to do all I do is place
the<00:01:34.650> shear<00:01:34.890> in<00:01:35.040> and<00:01:35.189> I<00:01:35.250> tap<00:01:35.520> tap<00:01:35.850> tap<00:01:36.150> tap<00:01:36.479> tap

00:01:36.770 --> 00:01:36.780 
the shear in and I tap tap tap tap tap

00:01:36.780 --> 00:01:39.830 
the shear in and I tap tap tap tap tap
tap<00:01:37.110> tap<00:01:37.380> and<00:01:37.560> rotate<00:01:38.310> this<00:01:38.460> year<00:01:38.759> can<00:01:39.390> you<00:01:39.420> see

00:01:39.830 --> 00:01:39.840 
tap tap and rotate this year can you see

00:01:39.840 --> 00:01:42.020 
tap tap and rotate this year can you see
that<00:01:40.259> by<00:01:40.530> rotating<00:01:40.950> the<00:01:41.130> comb<00:01:41.369> and<00:01:41.579> the<00:01:41.820> shear

00:01:42.020 --> 00:01:42.030 
that by rotating the comb and the shear

00:01:42.030 --> 00:01:44.330 
that by rotating the comb and the shear
together<00:01:42.420> you're<00:01:42.720> able<00:01:43.110> to<00:01:43.140> carve<00:01:43.590> out<00:01:43.890> around

00:01:44.330 --> 00:01:44.340 
together you're able to carve out around

00:01:44.340 --> 00:01:47.420 
together you're able to carve out around
the<00:01:44.460> ear<00:01:44.700> without<00:01:45.479> taking<00:01:46.110> this<00:01:46.259> so<00:01:46.500> short<00:01:46.920> it

00:01:47.420 --> 00:01:47.430 
the ear without taking this so short it

00:01:47.430 --> 00:01:49.490 
the ear without taking this so short it
gives<00:01:47.700> you<00:01:47.820> a<00:01:47.850> nice<00:01:48.060> clean<00:01:48.600> curved<00:01:49.049> line

00:01:49.490 --> 00:01:49.500 
gives you a nice clean curved line

00:01:49.500 --> 00:01:52.219 
gives you a nice clean curved line
around<00:01:49.799> the<00:01:50.159> ear<00:01:50.310> watch<00:01:51.000> the<00:01:51.240> action<00:01:51.630> I'll<00:01:51.780> do

00:01:52.219 --> 00:01:52.229 
around the ear watch the action I'll do

00:01:52.229 --> 00:01:59.219 
around the ear watch the action I'll do
it<00:01:52.350> in<00:01:52.439> slow<00:01:52.470> motion

00:01:59.219 --> 00:01:59.229 

00:01:59.229 --> 00:02:01.899 

see<00:02:00.229> how<00:02:00.320> the<00:02:00.380> white<00:02:00.590> teeth<00:02:00.830> catch<00:02:01.100> that<00:02:01.369> then

00:02:01.899 --> 00:02:01.909 
see how the white teeth catch that then

00:02:01.909 --> 00:02:03.070 
see how the white teeth catch that then
you're<00:02:02.090> going<00:02:02.180> to<00:02:02.240> come<00:02:02.450> in<00:02:02.540> with<00:02:02.659> your<00:02:02.750> shear

00:02:03.070 --> 00:02:03.080 
you're going to come in with your shear

00:02:03.080 --> 00:02:04.749 
you're going to come in with your shear
remember<00:02:03.770> I'm<00:02:03.860> not<00:02:04.009> going<00:02:04.189> to<00:02:04.250> cut<00:02:04.430> I'm<00:02:04.580> just

00:02:04.749 --> 00:02:04.759 
remember I'm not going to cut I'm just

00:02:04.759 --> 00:02:06.550 
remember I'm not going to cut I'm just
demonstrating<00:02:04.939> the<00:02:05.420> mechanics<00:02:06.020> and<00:02:06.140> then<00:02:06.439> I

00:02:06.550 --> 00:02:06.560 
demonstrating the mechanics and then I

00:02:06.560 --> 00:02:09.130 
demonstrating the mechanics and then I
would<00:02:06.710> tap<00:02:06.890> tap-tap<00:02:07.250> and<00:02:07.729> work<00:02:07.909> so<00:02:08.450> I<00:02:08.479> tap<00:02:08.840> tap

00:02:09.130 --> 00:02:09.140 
would tap tap-tap and work so I tap tap

00:02:09.140 --> 00:02:11.530 
would tap tap-tap and work so I tap tap
tap<00:02:09.470> tap<00:02:09.500> and<00:02:10.039> rotate<00:02:10.759> the<00:02:10.940> shear<00:02:11.209> right

00:02:11.530 --> 00:02:11.540 
tap tap and rotate the shear right

00:02:11.540 --> 00:02:13.570 
tap tap and rotate the shear right
around<00:02:11.840> the<00:02:12.050> ear<00:02:12.200> area<00:02:12.230> what<00:02:13.160> I<00:02:13.190> love<00:02:13.459> about

00:02:13.570 --> 00:02:13.580 
around the ear area what I love about

00:02:13.580 --> 00:02:15.610 
around the ear area what I love about
that<00:02:13.730> is<00:02:14.120> it<00:02:14.360> keeps<00:02:14.660> the<00:02:14.780> hair<00:02:15.110> out<00:02:15.290> of<00:02:15.350> the<00:02:15.560> way

00:02:15.610 --> 00:02:15.620 
that is it keeps the hair out of the way

00:02:15.620 --> 00:02:17.380 
that is it keeps the hair out of the way
here's<00:02:16.250> another<00:02:16.520> way<00:02:16.700> great<00:02:16.940> way<00:02:17.030> to<00:02:17.060> do<00:02:17.270> this

00:02:17.380 --> 00:02:17.390 
here's another way great way to do this

00:02:17.390 --> 00:02:19.120 
here's another way great way to do this
you<00:02:17.959> be<00:02:18.110> so<00:02:18.290> kind<00:02:18.470> and<00:02:18.680> she'll<00:02:18.860> bring<00:02:18.980> your

okay good

00:02:22.760 --> 00:02:24.610 
okay good
so<00:02:22.940> you<00:02:23.000> have<00:02:23.180> the<00:02:23.300> client<00:02:23.630> get<00:02:23.750> involved<00:02:24.260> now

00:02:24.610 --> 00:02:24.620 
so you have the client get involved now

00:02:24.620 --> 00:02:26.470 
so you have the client get involved now
can<00:02:24.890> you<00:02:25.010> see<00:02:25.250> they<00:02:25.459> folded<00:02:25.940> the<00:02:26.030> ear

00:02:26.470 --> 00:02:26.480 
can you see they folded the ear

00:02:26.480 --> 00:02:28.570 
can you see they folded the ear
now<00:02:26.750> you<00:02:26.810> can<00:02:27.080> come<00:02:27.260> in<00:02:27.380> still<00:02:27.709> using<00:02:28.190> the<00:02:28.310> comb

00:02:28.570 --> 00:02:28.580 
now you can come in still using the comb

00:02:28.580 --> 00:02:30.309 
now you can come in still using the comb
and<00:02:28.819> then<00:02:29.150> you<00:02:29.270> come<00:02:29.450> in<00:02:29.569> with<00:02:29.660> this<00:02:29.810> year<00:02:30.080> and

00:02:30.309 --> 00:02:30.319 
and then you come in with this year and

00:02:30.319 --> 00:02:32.259 
and then you come in with this year and
you're<00:02:30.470> just<00:02:30.709> going<00:02:30.950> through<00:02:31.069> this<00:02:31.730> way<00:02:32.000> if

00:02:32.259 --> 00:02:32.269 
you're just going through this way if

00:02:32.269 --> 00:02:34.600 
you're just going through this way if
you<00:02:32.569> cut<00:02:32.870> the<00:02:33.110> ear<00:02:33.350> it's<00:02:33.769> the<00:02:33.980> clients<00:02:34.430> fault

00:02:34.600 --> 00:02:34.610 
you cut the ear it's the clients fault

00:02:34.610 --> 00:02:35.530 
you cut the ear it's the clients fault
just<00:02:35.120> kidding

00:02:35.530 --> 00:02:35.540 
just kidding

00:02:35.540 --> 00:02:37.780 
just kidding
so<00:02:36.019> the<00:02:36.140> idea<00:02:36.440> really<00:02:36.620> set<00:02:36.950> Angela<00:02:37.400> once<00:02:37.610> again

00:02:37.780 --> 00:02:37.790 
so the idea really set Angela once again

00:02:37.790 --> 00:02:40.420 
so the idea really set Angela once again
recap<00:02:38.390> that<00:02:38.630> work<00:02:39.140> with<00:02:39.319> the<00:02:39.410> comb<00:02:39.620> let<00:02:40.250> that

00:02:40.420 --> 00:02:40.430 
recap that work with the comb let that

00:02:40.430 --> 00:02:44.199 
recap that work with the comb let that
capture<00:02:41.120> the<00:02:41.150> hair<00:02:41.420> around<00:02:41.709> the<00:02:42.709> ear<00:02:42.950> and<00:02:43.310> stop

00:02:44.199 --> 00:02:44.209 
capture the hair around the ear and stop

00:02:44.209 --> 00:02:46.960 
capture the hair around the ear and stop
going<00:02:44.480> in<00:02:44.750> freehand<00:02:45.410> and<00:02:45.590> stop<00:02:46.519> putting<00:02:46.730> in
