referring to is the one where I showed
you<00:00:16.209> how<00:00:16.270> to<00:00:16.359> make<00:00:16.539> an<00:00:16.690> inexpensive<00:00:16.960> pair<00:00:17.650> of

00:00:17.760 --> 00:00:17.770 
you how to make an inexpensive pair of

you how to make an inexpensive pair of
jump<00:00:18.070> rope<00:00:18.250> handles<00:00:18.640> such<00:00:18.789> as<00:00:18.940> this

00:00:19.380 --> 00:00:19.390 
jump rope handles such as this

00:00:19.390 --> 00:00:21.900 
jump rope handles such as this
now<00:00:19.840> these<00:00:20.050> do-it-yourself<00:00:20.320> handles<00:00:21.280> the

00:00:21.900 --> 00:00:21.910 
now these do-it-yourself handles the

00:00:21.910 --> 00:00:23.550 
now these do-it-yourself handles the
reason<00:00:22.240> that<00:00:22.300> I<00:00:22.390> created<00:00:22.720> them<00:00:22.810> was<00:00:22.990> to<00:00:23.140> extend

00:00:23.550 --> 00:00:23.560 
reason that I created them was to extend

00:00:23.560 --> 00:00:26.490 
reason that I created them was to extend
the<00:00:23.710> life<00:00:23.920> of<00:00:24.130> the<00:00:24.250> rope<00:00:24.460> as<00:00:25.030> I<00:00:25.480> turn<00:00:26.020> a<00:00:26.050> rope<00:00:26.320> at

00:00:26.490 --> 00:00:26.500 
the life of the rope as I turn a rope at

00:00:26.500 --> 00:00:27.480 
the life of the rope as I turn a rope at
high<00:00:26.680> speed<00:00:27.070> with<00:00:27.220> these<00:00:27.340> do-it-yourself

00:00:27.480 --> 00:00:27.490 
high speed with these do-it-yourself

00:00:27.490 --> 00:00:29.370 
high speed with these do-it-yourself
handles<00:00:28.330> it's<00:00:28.450> not<00:00:28.600> going<00:00:28.840> to<00:00:28.930> be<00:00:29.020> any<00:00:29.140> wear

00:00:29.370 --> 00:00:29.380 
handles it's not going to be any wear

00:00:29.380 --> 00:00:31.230 
handles it's not going to be any wear
and<00:00:29.410> tear<00:00:29.770> on<00:00:29.890> the<00:00:29.920> rope<00:00:30.130> itself<00:00:30.490> a<00:00:30.820> lot<00:00:31.119> of

00:00:31.230 --> 00:00:31.240 
and tear on the rope itself a lot of

00:00:31.240 --> 00:00:33.180 
and tear on the rope itself a lot of
times<00:00:31.420> what<00:00:31.539> happens<00:00:31.570> with<00:00:32.020> a<00:00:32.190> commercial

00:00:33.180 --> 00:00:33.190 
times what happens with a commercial

00:00:33.190 --> 00:00:34.950 
times what happens with a commercial
speed<00:00:33.460> rope<00:00:33.670> you<00:00:33.820> have<00:00:33.879> a<00:00:34.030> harder<00:00:34.420> plastic

00:00:34.950 --> 00:00:34.960 
speed rope you have a harder plastic

00:00:34.960 --> 00:00:37.200 
speed rope you have a harder plastic
handle<00:00:35.379> as<00:00:35.500> you<00:00:35.949> turn<00:00:36.160> that<00:00:36.309> handle<00:00:36.550> over<00:00:36.969> time

00:00:37.200 --> 00:00:37.210 
handle as you turn that handle over time

00:00:37.210 --> 00:00:38.639 
handle as you turn that handle over time
that<00:00:37.510> handle<00:00:37.780> starts<00:00:38.050> to<00:00:38.140> eat<00:00:38.350> away<00:00:38.440> at<00:00:38.530> the

00:00:38.639 --> 00:00:38.649 
that handle starts to eat away at the

00:00:38.649 --> 00:00:40.590 
that handle starts to eat away at the
rope<00:00:38.920> and<00:00:39.190> ultimately<00:00:39.609> the<00:00:39.789> rope<00:00:39.940> breaks<00:00:40.210> away

00:00:40.590 --> 00:00:40.600 
rope and ultimately the rope breaks away

00:00:40.600 --> 00:00:42.209 
rope and ultimately the rope breaks away
at<00:00:40.749> the<00:00:40.839> handle<00:00:41.230> so<00:00:41.710> if<00:00:41.769> you<00:00:41.890> do<00:00:42.039> it<00:00:42.129> yourself

00:00:42.209 --> 00:00:42.219 
at the handle so if you do it yourself

00:00:42.219 --> 00:00:44.459 
at the handle so if you do it yourself
handles<00:00:42.909> okay<00:00:43.089> that<00:00:43.300> problem<00:00:43.719> is<00:00:43.809> eliminated

00:00:44.459 --> 00:00:44.469 
handles okay that problem is eliminated

00:00:44.469 --> 00:00:47.130 
handles okay that problem is eliminated
now<00:00:44.949> since<00:00:45.190> I<00:00:45.309> filmed<00:00:45.609> that<00:00:45.940> initial<00:00:46.569> tutorial

00:00:47.130 --> 00:00:47.140 
now since I filmed that initial tutorial

00:00:47.140 --> 00:00:48.930 
now since I filmed that initial tutorial
showing<00:00:47.440> these<00:00:47.679> handles<00:00:48.100> I've<00:00:48.579> had<00:00:48.729> a<00:00:48.760> lot<00:00:48.909> of

00:00:48.930 --> 00:00:48.940 
showing these handles I've had a lot of

00:00:48.940 --> 00:00:50.849 
showing these handles I've had a lot of
questions<00:00:49.210> come<00:00:49.659> in<00:00:49.780> to<00:00:49.929> me<00:00:50.050> about<00:00:50.319> working

00:00:50.849 --> 00:00:50.859 
questions come in to me about working

00:00:50.859 --> 00:00:53.129 
questions come in to me about working
with<00:00:51.039> a<00:00:51.069> weighted<00:00:51.579> handle<00:00:51.969> ok<00:00:52.389> people<00:00:52.719> asking

00:00:53.129 --> 00:00:53.139 
with a weighted handle ok people asking

me one is there something that you can
create<00:00:56.139> okay<00:00:56.799> a<00:00:56.829> weighted<00:00:57.190> handle<00:00:57.519> or<00:00:57.639> two<00:00:57.879> is

00:00:58.049 --> 00:00:58.059 
create okay a weighted handle or two is

00:00:58.059 --> 00:00:59.430 
create okay a weighted handle or two is
something<00:00:58.299> that<00:00:58.539> I<00:00:58.600> need<00:00:58.659> to<00:00:58.929> go<00:00:59.139> out<00:00:59.260> and

00:00:59.430 --> 00:00:59.440 
something that I need to go out and

purchase commercially now rather than

00:01:02.409 --> 00:01:04.229 
purchase commercially now rather than
doing<00:01:02.709> Iowa<00:01:03.100> what<00:01:03.249> I<00:01:03.280> suggest<00:01:03.760> doing<00:01:03.879> is

doing Iowa what I suggest doing is

00:01:04.239 --> 00:01:06.450 
doing Iowa what I suggest doing is
simply<00:01:04.449> adding<00:01:05.260> weight<00:01:05.470> to<00:01:05.650> yourself<00:01:06.070> okay

00:01:06.450 --> 00:01:06.460 
simply adding weight to yourself okay

00:01:06.460 --> 00:01:09.149 
simply adding weight to yourself okay
what<00:01:06.640> you<00:01:06.760> can<00:01:06.880> do<00:01:07.260> is<00:01:08.260> simply<00:01:08.710> take<00:01:08.920> an

00:01:09.149 --> 00:01:09.159 
what you can do is simply take an

00:01:09.159 --> 00:01:11.459 
what you can do is simply take an
inexpensive<00:01:09.820> pair<00:01:10.689> of<00:01:10.840> pink<00:01:11.049> little<00:01:11.320> wrist

okay so I have a waiting speed rope a
lot<00:01:29.020> of<00:01:29.200> the<00:01:29.380> weighted<00:01:30.250> rope<00:01:30.430> extension<00:01:30.850> see

00:01:30.990 --> 00:01:31.000 
lot of the weighted rope extension see

00:01:31.000 --> 00:01:33.179 
lot of the weighted rope extension see
on<00:01:31.119> the<00:01:31.240> market<00:01:31.450> commercially<00:01:32.259> aren't<00:01:33.130> as

on the market commercially aren't as

00:01:33.189 --> 00:01:35.789 
on the market commercially aren't as
fast<00:01:33.490> as<00:01:33.789> your<00:01:33.939> traditional<00:01:34.869> speed<00:01:35.679> or

00:01:35.789 --> 00:01:35.799 
fast as your traditional speed or

00:01:35.799 --> 00:01:38.010 
fast as your traditional speed or
freestyle<00:01:36.280> ropes<00:01:36.640> okay<00:01:37.060> so<00:01:37.119> when<00:01:37.479> you<00:01:37.570> go<00:01:37.780> with

00:01:38.010 --> 00:01:38.020 
freestyle ropes okay so when you go with

00:01:38.020 --> 00:01:39.480 
freestyle ropes okay so when you go with
the<00:01:38.140> weighted<00:01:38.469> handles<00:01:38.799> you<00:01:38.859> typically<00:01:39.250> have

00:01:39.480 --> 00:01:39.490 
the weighted handles you typically have

00:01:39.490 --> 00:01:41.160 
the weighted handles you typically have
a<00:01:39.520> trade-off<00:01:39.909> in<00:01:40.240> terms<00:01:40.270> of<00:01:40.630> speed<00:01:40.990> and

00:01:41.160 --> 00:01:41.170 
a trade-off in terms of speed and

00:01:41.170 --> 00:01:42.840 
a trade-off in terms of speed and
tricking<00:01:41.530> ability<00:01:41.950> okay<00:01:42.520> whether<00:01:42.670> you're

00:01:42.840 --> 00:01:42.850 
tricking ability okay whether you're

00:01:42.850 --> 00:01:45.480 
tricking ability okay whether you're
working<00:01:43.179> with<00:01:43.329> just<00:01:43.570> a<00:01:44.020> high<00:01:44.229> speed<00:01:45.159> full

00:01:45.480 --> 00:01:45.490 
working with just a high speed full

00:01:45.490 --> 00:01:47.550 
working with just a high speed full
sprint<00:01:46.000> pace<00:01:46.299> or<00:01:46.539> you're<00:01:47.020> mixing<00:01:47.380> in

00:01:47.550 --> 00:01:47.560 
sprint pace or you're mixing in

00:01:47.560 --> 00:01:48.719 
sprint pace or you're mixing in
different<00:01:48.039> turning<00:01:48.369> style

00:01:48.719 --> 00:01:48.729 
different turning style

00:01:48.729 --> 00:01:50.399 
different turning style
okay<00:01:48.939> Chris<00:01:49.210> crosses<00:01:49.689> and<00:01:49.840> double<00:01:50.140> unders

00:01:50.399 --> 00:01:50.409 
okay Chris crosses and double unders

00:01:50.409 --> 00:01:52.109 
okay Chris crosses and double unders
with<00:01:50.979> the<00:01:51.100> way<00:01:51.219> the<00:01:51.280> ropes<00:01:51.549> you<00:01:51.670> tend<00:01:51.939> to<00:01:51.969> be

00:01:52.109 --> 00:01:52.119 
with the way the ropes you tend to be

00:01:52.119 --> 00:01:54.929 
with the way the ropes you tend to be
limited<00:01:52.359> to<00:01:52.719> an<00:01:52.840> extent<00:01:53.310> so<00:01:54.310> by<00:01:54.429> adding<00:01:54.789> weight

00:01:54.929 --> 00:01:54.939 
limited to an extent so by adding weight

00:01:54.939 --> 00:01:57.569 
limited to an extent so by adding weight
to<00:01:54.999> your<00:01:55.990> wrist<00:01:56.560> rather<00:01:57.100> than<00:01:57.340> the<00:01:57.399> rope

00:01:57.569 --> 00:01:57.579 
to your wrist rather than the rope

00:01:57.579 --> 00:01:59.510 
to your wrist rather than the rope
itself<00:01:57.999> you're<00:01:58.600> the<00:01:58.749> best<00:01:58.960> of<00:01:59.109> both<00:01:59.320> worlds

00:01:59.510 --> 00:01:59.520 
itself you're the best of both worlds

00:01:59.520 --> 00:02:02.459 
itself you're the best of both worlds
another<00:02:00.520> obvious<00:02:00.759> benefit<00:02:01.450> is<00:02:01.659> that<00:02:01.689> you<00:02:02.140> can

00:02:02.459 --> 00:02:02.469 
another obvious benefit is that you can

00:02:02.469 --> 00:02:04.260 
another obvious benefit is that you can
remove<00:02:02.590> the<00:02:03.009> way<00:02:03.159> it's<00:02:03.819> not<00:02:03.969> something<00:02:04.240> that

00:02:04.260 --> 00:02:04.270 
remove the way it's not something that

00:02:04.270 --> 00:02:06.480 
remove the way it's not something that
you<00:02:04.479> need<00:02:04.659> to<00:02:04.689> use<00:02:04.990> all<00:02:05.229> the<00:02:05.380> time<00:02:05.619> so<00:02:05.920> if<00:02:06.340> you'd

00:02:06.480 --> 00:02:06.490 
you need to use all the time so if you'd

00:02:06.490 --> 00:02:08.550 
you need to use all the time so if you'd
like<00:02:06.549> to<00:02:06.850> work<00:02:06.999> with<00:02:07.060> a<00:02:07.539> way<00:02:07.899> to<00:02:07.960> handle<00:02:08.259> at

00:02:08.550 --> 00:02:08.560 
like to work with a way to handle at

00:02:08.560 --> 00:02:10.260 
like to work with a way to handle at
some<00:02:08.830> point<00:02:09.130> but<00:02:09.520> you<00:02:09.670> also<00:02:09.819> want<00:02:10.090> to<00:02:10.119> have<00:02:10.179> the

00:02:10.260 --> 00:02:10.270 
some point but you also want to have the

00:02:10.270 --> 00:02:12.340 
some point but you also want to have the
option<00:02:10.780> to<00:02:11.080> remove<00:02:11.500> it<00:02:11.680> okay<00:02:11.980> this<00:02:12.100> is

00:02:12.340 --> 00:02:12.350 
option to remove it okay this is

00:02:12.350 --> 00:02:13.900 
option to remove it okay this is
again<00:02:12.530> something<00:02:12.800> that<00:02:13.040> you<00:02:13.190> can<00:02:13.370> use<00:02:13.610> now

00:02:13.900 --> 00:02:13.910 
again something that you can use now

00:02:13.910 --> 00:02:16.030 
again something that you can use now
terms<00:02:14.570> of<00:02:14.720> why<00:02:14.870> you<00:02:14.930> might<00:02:15.260> potentially<00:02:15.560> want

00:02:16.030 --> 00:02:16.040 
terms of why you might potentially want

00:02:16.040 --> 00:02:19.150 
terms of why you might potentially want
to<00:02:16.250> use<00:02:16.580> additional<00:02:17.420> weight<00:02:17.890> it's<00:02:18.890> going<00:02:19.100> to

00:02:19.150 --> 00:02:19.160 
to use additional weight it's going to

00:02:19.160 --> 00:02:20.830 
to use additional weight it's going to
place<00:02:19.340> a<00:02:19.370> greater<00:02:19.730> emphasis<00:02:19.820> on<00:02:20.180> the<00:02:20.510> upper

00:02:20.830 --> 00:02:20.840 
place a greater emphasis on the upper

00:02:20.840 --> 00:02:21.160 
place a greater emphasis on the upper
body

00:02:21.160 --> 00:02:21.170 
body

00:02:21.170 --> 00:02:22.930 
body
okay<00:02:21.380> particularly<00:02:22.010> the<00:02:22.190> shoulders<00:02:22.670> they

00:02:22.930 --> 00:02:22.940 
okay particularly the shoulders they

00:02:22.940 --> 00:02:24.550 
okay particularly the shoulders they
working<00:02:23.210> with<00:02:23.360> just<00:02:23.690> one<00:02:23.870> pound<00:02:24.170> on<00:02:24.410> each

00:02:24.550 --> 00:02:24.560 
working with just one pound on each

00:02:24.560 --> 00:02:26.590 
working with just one pound on each
wrist<00:02:24.830> as<00:02:25.100> you<00:02:25.430> jump<00:02:25.820> rope<00:02:26.030> for<00:02:26.300> even<00:02:26.510> a<00:02:26.570> few

00:02:26.590 --> 00:02:26.600 
wrist as you jump rope for even a few

00:02:26.600 --> 00:02:28.480 
wrist as you jump rope for even a few
minutes<00:02:26.870> at<00:02:27.080> a<00:02:27.140> time<00:02:27.380> upendo<00:02:27.830> is<00:02:27.950> a<00:02:27.980> much

00:02:28.480 --> 00:02:28.490 
minutes at a time upendo is a much

00:02:28.490 --> 00:02:30.250 
minutes at a time upendo is a much
greater<00:02:28.520> strain<00:02:29.270> from<00:02:29.540> an<00:02:29.690> endurance

00:02:30.250 --> 00:02:30.260 
greater strain from an endurance

00:02:30.260 --> 00:02:31.630 
greater strain from an endurance
standpoint<00:02:30.770> throughout<00:02:31.070> your<00:02:31.190> shoulders

00:02:31.630 --> 00:02:31.640 
standpoint throughout your shoulders

00:02:31.640 --> 00:02:33.760 
standpoint throughout your shoulders
okay<00:02:31.940> so<00:02:32.150> there<00:02:32.390> are<00:02:32.510> certainly<00:02:33.260> benefits

00:02:33.760 --> 00:02:33.770 
okay so there are certainly benefits

00:02:33.770 --> 00:02:36.220 
okay so there are certainly benefits
that<00:02:33.920> do<00:02:34.100> come<00:02:34.400> with<00:02:34.610> the<00:02:34.910> added<00:02:35.270> weight<00:02:35.450> so

00:02:36.220 --> 00:02:36.230 
that do come with the added weight so

00:02:36.230 --> 00:02:38.740 
that do come with the added weight so
what<00:02:36.440> I'm<00:02:36.530> going<00:02:36.770> to<00:02:36.800> do<00:02:37.040> now<00:02:37.280> is<00:02:37.640> just<00:02:37.970> film<00:02:38.570> a

00:02:38.740 --> 00:02:38.750 
what I'm going to do now is just film a

00:02:38.750 --> 00:02:40.660 
what I'm going to do now is just film a
minute<00:02:39.080> or<00:02:39.170> so<00:02:39.350> of<00:02:39.410> me<00:02:39.680> jumping<00:02:40.070> rope<00:02:40.220> with

00:02:40.660 --> 00:02:40.670 
minute or so of me jumping rope with

00:02:40.670 --> 00:02:43.300 
minute or so of me jumping rope with
this<00:02:40.850> speed<00:02:41.600> rope<00:02:41.840> with<00:02:42.080> the<00:02:42.110> addition<00:02:42.650> of<00:02:42.770> the

00:02:43.300 --> 00:02:43.310 
this speed rope with the addition of the

00:02:43.310 --> 00:02:46.330 
this speed rope with the addition of the
weighted<00:02:44.080> wrist<00:02:45.080> weights<00:02:45.290> so<00:02:45.920> what<00:02:46.070> you<00:02:46.190> can

00:02:46.330 --> 00:02:46.340 
weighted wrist weights so what you can

00:02:46.340 --> 00:02:48.790 
weighted wrist weights so what you can
see<00:02:46.550> then<00:02:46.760> is<00:02:46.910> that<00:02:47.110> one<00:02:48.110> I<00:02:48.140> don't<00:02:48.410> lose<00:02:48.530> any

00:02:48.790 --> 00:02:48.800 
see then is that one I don't lose any

00:02:48.800 --> 00:02:50.290 
see then is that one I don't lose any
turning<00:02:49.160> speed<00:02:49.430> at<00:02:49.520> all<00:02:49.610> with<00:02:49.790> the<00:02:49.880> rope<00:02:50.030> and

00:02:50.290 --> 00:02:50.300 
turning speed at all with the rope and

00:02:50.300 --> 00:02:52.090 
turning speed at all with the rope and
two<00:02:50.720> I<00:02:50.750> don't<00:02:50.990> lose<00:02:51.200> the<00:02:51.440> ability<00:02:51.560> to<00:02:51.950> perform

00:02:52.090 --> 00:02:52.100 
two I don't lose the ability to perform

00:02:52.100 --> 00:02:53.680 
two I don't lose the ability to perform
different<00:02:52.610> turning<00:02:52.910> styles<00:02:53.330> okay<00:02:53.540> whether

00:02:53.680 --> 00:02:53.690 
different turning styles okay whether

00:02:53.690 --> 00:02:56.410 
different turning styles okay whether
it's<00:02:53.900> criss<00:02:54.110> cross<00:02:54.410> or<00:02:54.650> double<00:02:54.950> unders<00:02:55.220> so<00:02:55.730> let

00:02:56.410 --> 00:02:56.420 
it's criss cross or double unders so let

00:02:56.420 --> 00:04:11.410 
it's criss cross or double unders so let
me<00:02:56.510> show<00:02:56.690> you<00:02:56.750> that<00:02:56.840> now

00:04:11.410 --> 00:04:11.420 

00:04:11.420 --> 00:04:14.209 

okay<00:04:12.420> so<00:04:12.480> as<00:04:12.659> you<00:04:12.719> can<00:04:12.870> see<00:04:12.989> the<00:04:13.530> addition<00:04:14.010> of

00:04:14.209 --> 00:04:14.219 
okay so as you can see the addition of

00:04:14.219 --> 00:04:16.610 
okay so as you can see the addition of
these<00:04:14.430> wrist<00:04:14.939> weights<00:04:15.150> does<00:04:15.689> not<00:04:15.959> impede<00:04:16.350> my

00:04:16.610 --> 00:04:16.620 
these wrist weights does not impede my

00:04:16.620 --> 00:04:18.379 
these wrist weights does not impede my
ability<00:04:16.650> to<00:04:17.100> perform<00:04:17.280> different<00:04:17.850> turning

00:04:18.379 --> 00:04:18.389 
ability to perform different turning

00:04:18.389 --> 00:04:20.840 
ability to perform different turning
styles<00:04:18.900> it<00:04:19.229> does<00:04:19.410> not<00:04:19.620> slow<00:04:19.979> down<00:04:20.009> the<00:04:20.489> rope<00:04:20.669> at

00:04:20.840 --> 00:04:20.850 
styles it does not slow down the rope at

00:04:20.850 --> 00:04:23.540 
styles it does not slow down the rope at
all<00:04:21.030> okay<00:04:21.389> I'm<00:04:21.509> able<00:04:21.750> to<00:04:22.310> realize<00:04:23.310> the

00:04:23.540 --> 00:04:23.550 
all okay I'm able to realize the

00:04:23.550 --> 00:04:25.820 
all okay I'm able to realize the
benefits<00:04:24.060> of<00:04:24.240> the<00:04:24.479> speed<00:04:24.750> rope<00:04:24.930> plus<00:04:25.440> the

00:04:25.820 --> 00:04:25.830 
benefits of the speed rope plus the

00:04:25.830 --> 00:04:28.159 
benefits of the speed rope plus the
addition<00:04:26.250> of<00:04:26.370> the<00:04:26.639> added<00:04:26.940> weight<00:04:27.120> okay<00:04:27.630> so<00:04:27.690> if

00:04:28.159 --> 00:04:28.169 
addition of the added weight okay so if

00:04:28.169 --> 00:04:31.189 
addition of the added weight okay so if
you<00:04:28.410> are<00:04:28.440> looking<00:04:29.039> to<00:04:29.460> include<00:04:30.300> a<00:04:30.720> weighted

00:04:31.189 --> 00:04:31.199 
you are looking to include a weighted

00:04:31.199 --> 00:04:33.529 
you are looking to include a weighted
jump<00:04:31.500> rope<00:04:31.740> into<00:04:32.039> your<00:04:32.310> routine<00:04:32.729> either<00:04:33.150> all

00:04:33.529 --> 00:04:33.539 
jump rope into your routine either all

00:04:33.539 --> 00:04:36.230 
jump rope into your routine either all
the<00:04:33.720> time<00:04:33.990> or<00:04:34.229> sometimes<00:04:34.530> this<00:04:35.430> is<00:04:35.699> an<00:04:35.850> option

00:04:36.230 --> 00:04:36.240 
the time or sometimes this is an option

00:04:36.240 --> 00:04:37.939 
the time or sometimes this is an option
worthy<00:04:36.630> of<00:04:36.690> your<00:04:36.810> consideration<00:04:36.930> okay<00:04:37.680> it's
