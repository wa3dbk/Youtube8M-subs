heavy<00:01:48.420> pistol<00:01:48.869> in<00:01:49.049> my<00:01:49.110> opinion<00:01:49.920> I<00:01:50.130> think<00:01:50.159> this

00:01:50.510 --> 00:01:50.520 
heavy pistol in my opinion I think this

00:01:50.520 --> 00:01:53.179 
heavy pistol in my opinion I think this
is<00:01:50.579> like<00:01:51.000> a<00:01:51.240> desert<00:01:51.570> eagle<00:01:51.840> sounds<00:01:52.799> like<00:01:52.950> one

00:01:53.179 --> 00:01:53.189 
is like a desert eagle sounds like one

00:01:53.189 --> 00:01:55.219 
is like a desert eagle sounds like one

00:01:57.590 --> 00:01:57.600 
recoilless kind of feels like one and it

00:01:57.600 --> 00:01:59.300 
recoilless kind of feels like one and it
looks<00:01:57.750> like<00:01:57.899> what<00:01:58.290> I<00:01:58.320> think<00:01:58.710> I<00:01:58.770> ready<00:01:58.890> set<00:01:59.100> that
