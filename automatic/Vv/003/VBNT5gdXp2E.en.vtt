build a modern house without stone but

00:01:00.140 --> 00:01:01.479 
build a modern house without stone but
not<00:01:00.409> a<00:01:00.440> lot<00:01:00.650> of<00:01:00.680> stone<00:01:00.979> we're<00:01:01.129> gonna<00:01:01.250> use

00:01:01.479 --> 00:01:01.489 
not a lot of stone we're gonna use

00:01:01.489 --> 00:01:03.850 
not a lot of stone we're gonna use
mainly<00:01:01.790> modern<00:01:02.600> materials<00:01:03.049> so<00:01:03.170> we<00:01:03.199> have<00:01:03.409> half

00:01:03.850 --> 00:01:03.860 
mainly modern materials so we have half

00:01:03.860 --> 00:01:05.229 
mainly modern materials so we have half
slabs<00:01:04.190> of<00:01:04.369> each<00:01:04.460> because<00:01:04.640> half<00:01:04.879> slab<00:01:05.119> is

00:01:05.229 --> 00:01:05.239 
slabs of each because half slab is

00:01:05.239 --> 00:01:06.280 
slabs of each because half slab is
really<00:01:05.420> important<00:01:05.720> when<00:01:05.840> it<00:01:05.900> comes<00:01:05.930> to<00:01:06.140> making

00:01:06.280 --> 00:01:06.290 
really important when it comes to making

00:01:06.290 --> 00:01:08.260 
really important when it comes to making
shape<00:01:06.650> we'll<00:01:07.189> have<00:01:07.310> stairs<00:01:07.640> again<00:01:07.850> important

00:01:08.260 --> 00:01:08.270 
shape we'll have stairs again important

00:01:08.270 --> 00:01:09.459 
shape we'll have stairs again important
for<00:01:08.420> shape<00:01:08.570> we're<00:01:08.719> gonna<00:01:08.810> use<00:01:08.960> glass<00:01:09.170> panes

00:01:09.459 --> 00:01:09.469 
for shape we're gonna use glass panes

00:01:09.469 --> 00:01:11.620 
for shape we're gonna use glass panes
because<00:01:09.799> glass<00:01:10.009> panes<00:01:10.340> add<00:01:10.549> depth<00:01:10.909> as<00:01:11.090> we<00:01:11.479> all

00:01:11.620 --> 00:01:11.630 
because glass panes add depth as we all

00:01:11.630 --> 00:01:13.359 
because glass panes add depth as we all
know<00:01:11.840> much<00:01:12.409> better<00:01:12.560> than<00:01:12.770> normal<00:01:12.859> glass<00:01:13.159> for

00:01:13.359 --> 00:01:13.369 
know much better than normal glass for

00:01:13.369 --> 00:01:14.620 
know much better than normal glass for
the<00:01:13.430> most<00:01:13.579> part<00:01:13.789> bushes<00:01:14.149> are<00:01:14.299> great<00:01:14.450> for

00:01:14.620 --> 00:01:14.630 
the most part bushes are great for

00:01:14.630 --> 00:01:16.209 
the most part bushes are great for
decoration<00:01:15.079> and<00:01:15.200> a<00:01:15.320> lot<00:01:15.439> of<00:01:15.469> modern<00:01:15.829> houses

00:01:16.209 --> 00:01:16.219 
decoration and a lot of modern houses

00:01:16.219 --> 00:01:18.099 
decoration and a lot of modern houses

alright so if we're going for some sort
of<00:01:48.020> doorway<00:01:48.319> look<00:01:48.469> here<00:01:48.590> we<00:01:48.679> might<00:01:48.770> put

00:01:48.940 --> 00:01:48.950 
of doorway look here we might put

00:01:48.950 --> 00:01:50.260 
of doorway look here we might put
pillars<00:01:49.219> on<00:01:49.369> each<00:01:49.460> side<00:01:49.609> of<00:01:49.640> the<00:01:49.759> doorway<00:01:49.969> okay

00:01:50.260 --> 00:01:50.270 
pillars on each side of the doorway okay

00:01:50.270 --> 00:01:52.419 
pillars on each side of the doorway okay
that's<00:01:50.420> a<00:01:50.450> very<00:01:50.630> simple<00:01:51.079> very<00:01:51.590> simple<00:01:51.979> idea

00:01:52.419 --> 00:01:52.429 
that's a very simple very simple idea

00:01:52.429 --> 00:01:52.840 
that's a very simple very simple idea
right

00:01:52.840 --> 00:01:52.850 
right

00:01:52.850 --> 00:01:54.219 
right
so<00:01:52.999> we<00:01:53.090> have<00:01:53.210> our<00:01:53.240> main<00:01:53.509> frame<00:01:53.810> and<00:01:53.960> then<00:01:54.140> we

00:01:54.219 --> 00:01:54.229 
so we have our main frame and then we

00:01:54.229 --> 00:01:55.779 
so we have our main frame and then we
have<00:01:54.380> this<00:01:54.530> which<00:01:54.740> adds<00:01:54.920> depth<00:01:55.249> and<00:01:55.429> it

00:01:55.779 --> 00:01:55.789 
have this which adds depth and it

00:01:55.789 --> 00:01:57.099 
have this which adds depth and it
changes<00:01:56.090> the<00:01:56.240> color<00:01:56.359> around<00:01:56.600> so<00:01:56.899> then<00:01:57.020> we

00:01:57.099 --> 00:01:57.109 
changes the color around so then we

00:01:57.109 --> 00:01:58.059 
changes the color around so then we
might<00:01:57.289> go<00:01:57.439> ahead<00:01:57.560> and<00:01:57.740> we<00:01:57.799> might<00:01:57.920> have<00:01:57.950> a

00:01:58.059 --> 00:01:58.069 
might go ahead and we might have a

00:01:58.069 --> 00:01:59.590 
might go ahead and we might have a
pillar<00:01:58.280> here<00:01:58.549> for<00:01:58.969> part<00:01:59.119> of<00:01:59.179> the<00:01:59.270> wall<00:01:59.420> and

00:01:59.590 --> 00:01:59.600 
pillar here for part of the wall and

00:01:59.600 --> 00:02:01.239 
pillar here for part of the wall and
then<00:01:59.749> we<00:01:59.840> might<00:01:59.990> have<00:02:00.079> another<00:02:00.319> marble<00:02:00.950> pillar

00:02:01.239 --> 00:02:01.249 
then we might have another marble pillar

00:02:01.249 --> 00:02:03.730 
then we might have another marble pillar
alright<00:02:01.819> so<00:02:02.030> this<00:02:02.210> is<00:02:02.420> the<00:02:02.539> house<00:02:02.689> this<00:02:03.439> is<00:02:03.619> all

00:02:03.730 --> 00:02:03.740 
alright so this is the house this is all

00:02:03.740 --> 00:02:05.230 
alright so this is the house this is all
extra<00:02:04.130> that<00:02:04.249> you<00:02:04.280> add<00:02:04.429> on<00:02:04.460> but<00:02:04.850> that's<00:02:04.939> kind<00:02:05.210> of

want<00:02:31.849> and<00:02:32.690> now<00:02:33.110> your<00:02:33.260> shape<00:02:33.410> is<00:02:33.590> flowing<00:02:33.920> right

00:02:34.059 --> 00:02:34.069 
want and now your shape is flowing right

00:02:34.069 --> 00:02:35.680 
want and now your shape is flowing right
it's<00:02:34.220> gonna<00:02:34.310> intersect<00:02:34.849> this<00:02:34.970> piece<00:02:35.209> and<00:02:35.390> also

00:02:35.680 --> 00:02:35.690 
it's gonna intersect this piece and also

00:02:35.690 --> 00:02:37.270 
it's gonna intersect this piece and also
we're<00:02:35.840> varying<00:02:36.230> our<00:02:36.319> wall<00:02:36.530> with<00:02:36.709> Zeus<00:02:36.920> as<00:02:37.160> you

00:02:37.270 --> 00:02:37.280 
we're varying our wall with Zeus as you

00:02:37.280 --> 00:02:38.559 
we're varying our wall with Zeus as you
can<00:02:37.400> see<00:02:37.549> this<00:02:37.640> wall<00:02:37.849> here<00:02:38.030> is<00:02:38.120> too<00:02:38.299> thick

00:02:38.559 --> 00:02:38.569 
can see this wall here is too thick

00:02:38.569 --> 00:02:41.110 
can see this wall here is too thick
right<00:02:39.260> oopsies<00:02:40.069> this<00:02:40.400> wall<00:02:40.610> is<00:02:40.640> too<00:02:40.879> thick

00:02:41.110 --> 00:02:41.120 
right oopsies this wall is too thick

00:02:41.120 --> 00:02:42.910 
right oopsies this wall is too thick
this<00:02:41.569> wall<00:02:41.780> here's<00:02:41.989> one<00:02:42.200> think<00:02:42.440> we're<00:02:42.560> varying

00:02:42.910 --> 00:02:42.920 
this wall here's one think we're varying

00:02:42.920 --> 00:02:44.800 
this wall here's one think we're varying
the<00:02:43.040> width<00:02:43.250> of<00:02:43.340> our<00:02:43.459> walls<00:02:43.700> and<00:02:43.879> we're<00:02:44.569> letting

00:02:44.800 --> 00:02:44.810 
the width of our walls and we're letting

00:02:44.810 --> 00:02:46.570 
the width of our walls and we're letting
the<00:02:45.019> shape<00:02:45.230> flow<00:02:45.530> through<00:02:45.830> an<00:02:45.950> intersect<00:02:46.340> but

00:02:46.570 --> 00:02:46.580 
the shape flow through an intersect but

00:02:46.580 --> 00:02:48.250 
the shape flow through an intersect but
at<00:02:46.760> the<00:02:46.849> same<00:02:47.030> time<00:02:47.299> we're<00:02:47.569> keeping<00:02:47.900> it<00:02:47.959> square

00:02:48.250 --> 00:02:48.260 
at the same time we're keeping it square

00:02:48.260 --> 00:02:49.509 
at the same time we're keeping it square
we're<00:02:48.440> not<00:02:48.530> doing<00:02:48.769> anything<00:02:48.950> up<00:02:49.220> here<00:02:49.400> you

00:02:49.509 --> 00:02:49.519 
we're not doing anything up here you

00:02:49.519 --> 00:02:50.830 
we're not doing anything up here you
know<00:02:49.610> we're<00:02:49.760> not<00:02:49.819> cutting<00:02:50.090> off<00:02:50.180> the<00:02:50.299> corner<00:02:50.660> or

00:02:50.830 --> 00:02:50.840 
know we're not cutting off the corner or

00:02:50.840 --> 00:02:52.630 
know we're not cutting off the corner or
you<00:02:51.290> know<00:02:51.410> kind<00:02:51.620> of<00:02:51.650> sloping<00:02:52.069> it<00:02:52.160> up<00:02:52.280> like<00:02:52.430> that

00:02:52.630 --> 00:02:52.640 
you know kind of sloping it up like that

00:02:52.640 --> 00:02:54.640 
you know kind of sloping it up like that
it's<00:02:53.090> square<00:02:53.360> okay<00:02:53.690> we<00:02:53.720> want<00:02:54.019> squares<00:02:54.440> that's

00:02:54.640 --> 00:02:54.650 
it's square okay we want squares that's

00:02:54.650 --> 00:02:55.930 
it's square okay we want squares that's
what<00:02:54.769> we<00:02:54.829> want<00:02:55.010> squares<00:02:55.280> are<00:02:55.400> very<00:02:55.519> important

00:02:55.930 --> 00:02:55.940 
what we want squares are very important

00:02:55.940 --> 00:02:57.699 
what we want squares are very important
and<00:02:56.060> thirdly<00:02:56.540> this<00:02:56.750> idea<00:02:57.019> of<00:02:57.110> intersection

00:02:57.699 --> 00:02:57.709 
and thirdly this idea of intersection

00:02:57.709 --> 00:02:59.199 
and thirdly this idea of intersection
also<00:02:58.040> works<00:02:58.250> when<00:02:58.459> it<00:02:58.549> comes<00:02:58.730> to<00:02:58.880> the<00:02:58.970> rubes

00:02:59.199 --> 00:02:59.209 
also works when it comes to the rubes

00:02:59.209 --> 00:03:00.940 
also works when it comes to the rubes
instead<00:02:59.810> of<00:02:59.900> having<00:03:00.140> a<00:03:00.200> roof<00:03:00.440> that<00:03:00.650> looks<00:03:00.829> like

00:03:00.940 --> 00:03:00.950 
instead of having a roof that looks like

00:03:00.950 --> 00:03:02.619 
instead of having a roof that looks like
this<00:03:01.129> nice<00:03:01.400> and<00:03:01.430> flat<00:03:01.760> we're<00:03:02.269> gonna<00:03:02.360> allow

00:03:02.619 --> 00:03:02.629 
this nice and flat we're gonna allow

00:03:02.629 --> 00:03:03.910 
this nice and flat we're gonna allow
this<00:03:02.900> shape<00:03:03.140> to<00:03:03.319> intersect

00:03:03.910 --> 00:03:03.920 
this shape to intersect

00:03:03.920 --> 00:03:05.259 
this shape to intersect
all<00:03:03.980> right<00:03:04.190> intersection<00:03:04.670> is<00:03:04.760> probably<00:03:05.150> the

00:03:05.259 --> 00:03:05.269 
all right intersection is probably the

00:03:05.269 --> 00:03:06.339 
all right intersection is probably the
biggest<00:03:05.540> part<00:03:05.780> when<00:03:05.959> it<00:03:05.989> comes<00:03:06.140> in<00:03:06.230> water

00:03:06.339 --> 00:03:06.349 
biggest part when it comes in water

00:03:06.349 --> 00:03:07.839 
biggest part when it comes in water
houses<00:03:06.709> and<00:03:06.860> that's<00:03:07.220> gonna<00:03:07.340> allow<00:03:07.430> the<00:03:07.579> shape

00:03:07.839 --> 00:03:07.849 
houses and that's gonna allow the shape

00:03:07.849 --> 00:03:10.300 
houses and that's gonna allow the shape
to<00:03:08.000> flow<00:03:08.180> upward<00:03:08.569> and<00:03:08.720> around<00:03:09.410> also<00:03:09.950> on

00:03:10.300 --> 00:03:10.310 
to flow upward and around also on

00:03:10.310 --> 00:03:11.530 
to flow upward and around also on
windows<00:03:10.640> here<00:03:10.849> we<00:03:11.000> can<00:03:11.150> add<00:03:11.239> a<00:03:11.269> little<00:03:11.420> extra

00:03:11.530 --> 00:03:11.540 
windows here we can add a little extra

00:03:11.540 --> 00:03:13.569 
windows here we can add a little extra
shape<00:03:11.870> with<00:03:12.019> our<00:03:12.110> stairs<00:03:12.530> because<00:03:12.860> again<00:03:13.129> we

00:03:13.569 --> 00:03:13.579 
shape with our stairs because again we

00:03:13.579 --> 00:03:15.069 
shape with our stairs because again we
want<00:03:13.730> to<00:03:13.879> have<00:03:13.970> depth<00:03:14.269> to<00:03:14.480> our<00:03:14.510> modern<00:03:14.900> houses

00:03:15.069 --> 00:03:15.079 
want to have depth to our modern houses

00:03:15.079 --> 00:03:16.210 
want to have depth to our modern houses
all<00:03:15.290> right<00:03:15.410> so<00:03:15.530> we're<00:03:15.620> gonna<00:03:15.709> run<00:03:15.890> over<00:03:16.040> here

00:03:16.210 --> 00:03:16.220 
all right so we're gonna run over here

00:03:16.220 --> 00:03:18.009 
all right so we're gonna run over here

you most of you have probably seen this

00:03:18.019 --> 00:03:19.509 
you most of you have probably seen this
tutorial<00:03:18.440> already<00:03:18.560> but<00:03:18.859> this<00:03:18.920> was<00:03:19.100> the<00:03:19.220> modern

00:03:19.509 --> 00:03:19.519 
tutorial already but this was the modern

00:03:19.519 --> 00:03:21.250 
tutorial already but this was the modern
restaurant<00:03:19.940> tutorial<00:03:20.299> and<00:03:20.420> you<00:03:20.480> can<00:03:20.600> see<00:03:20.780> we

00:03:21.250 --> 00:03:21.260 
restaurant tutorial and you can see we

00:03:21.260 --> 00:03:22.840 
restaurant tutorial and you can see we
have<00:03:21.440> pillars<00:03:21.859> behind<00:03:22.040> other<00:03:22.340> pillars<00:03:22.700> all

00:03:22.840 --> 00:03:22.850 
have pillars behind other pillars all

00:03:22.850 --> 00:03:24.490 
have pillars behind other pillars all
right<00:03:22.970> we<00:03:23.329> have<00:03:23.450> shape<00:03:23.660> on<00:03:23.810> our<00:03:23.930> windows

00:03:24.490 --> 00:03:24.500 
right we have shape on our windows

00:03:24.500 --> 00:03:26.860 
right we have shape on our windows
lú<00:03:24.980> kè<00:03:25.130> we<00:03:25.280> have<00:03:25.430> we<00:03:25.970> have<00:03:26.090> our<00:03:26.209> indented<00:03:26.690> glass

00:03:26.860 --> 00:03:26.870 
lú kè we have we have our indented glass

00:03:26.870 --> 00:03:28.360 
lú kè we have we have our indented glass
there<00:03:27.109> we<00:03:27.200> have<00:03:27.319> Busch<00:03:27.530> decorations<00:03:28.190> and

00:03:28.360 --> 00:03:28.370 
there we have Busch decorations and

00:03:28.370 --> 00:03:30.490 
there we have Busch decorations and
we've<00:03:28.819> used<00:03:29.060> our<00:03:29.600> half<00:03:29.840> slabs<00:03:30.109> to<00:03:30.290> create

00:03:30.490 --> 00:03:30.500 
we've used our half slabs to create

00:03:30.500 --> 00:03:32.110 
we've used our half slabs to create
shape<00:03:30.709> around<00:03:30.980> the<00:03:31.040> top<00:03:31.250> now<00:03:31.790> shape<00:03:32.030> around

00:03:32.110 --> 00:03:32.120 
shape around the top now shape around

00:03:32.120 --> 00:03:33.610 
shape around the top now shape around
the<00:03:32.269> top<00:03:32.420> is<00:03:32.569> pretty<00:03:32.750> easy<00:03:32.930> to<00:03:33.079> create<00:03:33.170> again

00:03:33.610 --> 00:03:33.620 
the top is pretty easy to create again

00:03:33.620 --> 00:03:35.349 
the top is pretty easy to create again
you<00:03:34.040> can<00:03:34.220> outline<00:03:34.730> just<00:03:34.760> about<00:03:34.970> anything<00:03:35.180> you

00:03:35.349 --> 00:03:35.359 
you can outline just about anything you

00:03:35.359 --> 00:03:37.270 
you can outline just about anything you
do<00:03:35.540> with<00:03:35.690> slabs<00:03:35.989> just<00:03:36.260> make<00:03:36.380> sure<00:03:36.620> you<00:03:37.160> don't

00:03:37.270 --> 00:03:37.280 
do with slabs just make sure you don't

00:03:37.280 --> 00:03:38.740 
do with slabs just make sure you don't
want<00:03:37.459> to<00:03:37.519> leave<00:03:37.609> the<00:03:37.730> corners<00:03:38.060> off<00:03:38.209> that's<00:03:38.599> not

00:03:38.740 --> 00:03:38.750 
want to leave the corners off that's not

00:03:38.750 --> 00:03:40.449 
want to leave the corners off that's not
a<00:03:38.780> very<00:03:38.989> modern<00:03:39.319> look<00:03:39.349> you<00:03:40.010> want<00:03:40.190> your<00:03:40.340> air

a very modern look you want your air

00:03:40.459 --> 00:03:42.280 
a very modern look you want your air
corners<00:03:40.819> to<00:03:40.910> be<00:03:41.000> square<00:03:41.329> that's<00:03:41.720> modern<00:03:42.109> all

00:03:42.280 --> 00:03:42.290 
corners to be square that's modern all

00:03:42.290 --> 00:03:43.839 
corners to be square that's modern all
right<00:03:42.560> so<00:03:43.069> those<00:03:43.190> are<00:03:43.310> a<00:03:43.340> couple<00:03:43.400> quick<00:03:43.790> tips
