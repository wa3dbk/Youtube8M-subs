here<00:01:37.009> which<00:01:37.310> basically<00:01:37.850> makes<00:01:38.150> the<00:01:38.240> system

00:01:38.440 --> 00:01:38.450 
here which basically makes the system

00:01:38.450 --> 00:01:43.330 
here which basically makes the system
sound<00:01:38.840> way<00:01:39.140> better<00:01:41.680> so<00:01:42.680> I<00:01:42.710> can<00:01:42.920> find<00:01:43.100> the<00:01:43.159> right
