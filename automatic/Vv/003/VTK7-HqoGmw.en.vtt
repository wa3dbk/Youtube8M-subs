00:02:31.120 --> 00:02:34.240 
like anyone would in the in a month and
you<00:02:32.120> can<00:02:32.270> see<00:02:32.450> that<00:02:32.690> it's<00:02:32.990> still<00:02:33.260> in<00:02:33.440> pretty

00:02:34.240 --> 00:02:34.250 
you can see that it's still in pretty

00:02:34.250 --> 00:02:36.880 
you can see that it's still in pretty
pristine<00:02:34.970> condition<00:02:35.540> here<00:02:35.780> one<00:02:36.350> problem<00:02:36.770> that

00:02:36.880 --> 00:02:36.890 
pristine condition here one problem that

00:02:36.890 --> 00:02:38.560 
pristine condition here one problem that
I've<00:02:37.130> noticed<00:02:37.520> with<00:02:37.790> it<00:02:38.000> is<00:02:38.120> actually<00:02:38.300> the

00:02:38.560 --> 00:02:38.570 
I've noticed with it is actually the

00:02:38.570 --> 00:02:40.980 
I've noticed with it is actually the
sliding<00:02:39.050> part<00:02:39.290> can<00:02:39.560> come<00:02:39.860> off<00:02:40.010> fairly<00:02:40.340> easily

00:02:40.980 --> 00:02:40.990 
sliding part can come off fairly easily

00:02:40.990 --> 00:02:43.060 
sliding part can come off fairly easily
but<00:02:41.990> that's<00:02:42.170> all<00:02:42.320> right<00:02:42.350> it's<00:02:42.590> not<00:02:42.710> that<00:02:42.890> big<00:02:43.010> a

00:02:43.060 --> 00:02:43.070 
but that's all right it's not that big a

00:02:43.070 --> 00:02:46.420 
but that's all right it's not that big a
deal<00:02:43.450> and<00:02:44.450> the<00:02:44.660> one<00:02:45.530> other<00:02:45.800> concern<00:02:46.190> that<00:02:46.400> I

00:02:46.420 --> 00:02:46.430 
deal and the one other concern that I

00:02:46.430 --> 00:02:48.940 
deal and the one other concern that I
have<00:02:46.520> is<00:02:46.700> just<00:02:47.240> it's<00:02:48.200> a<00:02:48.380> little<00:02:48.590> bit<00:02:48.709> difficult

00:02:48.940 --> 00:02:48.950 
have is just it's a little bit difficult

00:02:48.950 --> 00:02:51.130 
have is just it's a little bit difficult
to<00:02:49.250> push<00:02:49.490> the<00:02:49.670> buttons<00:02:49.850> while<00:02:50.360> it's<00:02:50.630> in<00:02:50.810> here

00:02:51.130 --> 00:02:51.140 
to push the buttons while it's in here

00:02:51.140 --> 00:02:54.430 
to push the buttons while it's in here
however<00:02:51.980> it's<00:02:52.970> not<00:02:53.270> that<00:02:53.510> big<00:02:53.690> a<00:02:53.750> deal<00:02:53.840> when

00:02:54.430 --> 00:02:54.440 
however it's not that big a deal when

00:02:54.440 --> 00:02:56.910 
however it's not that big a deal when
you<00:02:54.470> consider<00:02:54.890> the<00:02:55.640> quality<00:02:56.180> of<00:02:56.420> the<00:02:56.660> case

00:02:56.910 --> 00:02:56.920 
you consider the quality of the case

00:02:56.920 --> 00:02:59.380 
you consider the quality of the case
