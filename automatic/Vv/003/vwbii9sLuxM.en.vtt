the other streaks give a quick rundown

00:03:16.239 --> 00:03:19.319 
the other streaks give a quick rundown
basically<00:03:17.169> the<00:03:17.290> dog<00:03:17.470> it's<00:03:17.769> really<00:03:17.919> flaky<00:03:18.400> an

00:03:19.319 --> 00:03:19.329 
basically the dog it's really flaky an

00:03:19.329 --> 00:03:21.539

IMS<00:03:19.780> that's<00:03:20.049> also<00:03:20.319> very<00:03:20.349> flaky<00:03:20.979> in<00:03:21.159> my<00:03:21.310> opinion

00:03:21.539 --> 00:03:21.549 
IMS that's also very flaky in my opinion

00:03:23.819 --> 00:03:23.829 
it can be powerful sometimes but a lot
