music's Pro one of the main advantages
of<00:00:12.809> musics<00:00:13.470> is<00:00:13.680> that<00:00:13.920> we<00:00:13.980> use<00:00:14.100> isomorphic

00:00:14.750 --> 00:00:14.760 
of musics is that we use isomorphic

of musics is that we use isomorphic
keyboards<00:00:15.210> this<00:00:15.629> means<00:00:15.900> the<00:00:16.200> harmonic

00:00:16.730 --> 00:00:16.740 
keyboards this means the harmonic

00:00:16.740 --> 00:00:18.590 
keyboards this means the harmonic
properties<00:00:17.250> of<00:00:17.400> music<00:00:17.700> are<00:00:17.820> built<00:00:18.030> right<00:00:18.300> into

00:00:18.590 --> 00:00:18.600 
properties of music are built right into

00:00:18.600 --> 00:00:20.900 
properties of music are built right into
the<00:00:18.840> actual<00:00:19.140> layouts<00:00:19.560> for<00:00:20.220> example<00:00:20.610> you<00:00:20.760> only

00:00:20.900 --> 00:00:20.910 
the actual layouts for example you only

00:00:20.910 --> 00:00:23.800 
the actual layouts for example you only
have<00:00:21.150> to<00:00:21.240> learn<00:00:21.450> one<00:00:21.960> shape<00:00:22.710> for<00:00:23.250> a<00:00:23.280> major

00:00:23.800 --> 00:00:23.810 
have to learn one shape for a major

00:00:23.810 --> 00:00:26.089 
have to learn one shape for a major
construct<00:00:24.810> in<00:00:24.960> music<00:00:25.320> for<00:00:25.500> example<00:00:25.830> a<00:00:25.890> major

00:00:26.089 --> 00:00:26.099 
construct in music for example a major

00:00:26.099 --> 00:00:28.429 
construct in music for example a major
chord<00:00:26.519> is<00:00:26.759> an<00:00:27.420> upwards<00:00:27.750> triangle<00:00:28.199> in<00:00:28.320> this

00:00:28.429 --> 00:00:28.439 
chord is an upwards triangle in this

00:00:28.439 --> 00:00:31.640 
chord is an upwards triangle in this
layout<00:00:28.800> so<00:00:29.070> Cee<00:00:29.519> and<00:00:29.640> G<00:00:30.210> if<00:00:30.539> we<00:00:31.289> want<00:00:31.470> to<00:00:31.529> play

00:00:31.640 --> 00:00:31.650 
layout so Cee and G if we want to play

00:00:31.650 --> 00:00:33.500 
layout so Cee and G if we want to play
any<00:00:31.890> other<00:00:32.099> major<00:00:32.369> chord<00:00:32.790> all<00:00:33.030> we<00:00:33.150> have<00:00:33.270> to<00:00:33.390> do

00:00:33.500 --> 00:00:33.510 
any other major chord all we have to do

00:00:33.510 --> 00:00:35.270 
any other major chord all we have to do
is<00:00:33.690> actually<00:00:33.870> play<00:00:34.110> the<00:00:34.380> same<00:00:34.620> upper<00:00:34.980> triangle

00:00:35.270 --> 00:00:35.280 
is actually play the same upper triangle

00:00:35.280 --> 00:00:37.310 
is actually play the same upper triangle
starting<00:00:35.910> at<00:00:35.970> a<00:00:36.000> different<00:00:36.330> location<00:00:36.420> so<00:00:36.930> if

00:00:37.310 --> 00:00:37.320 
starting at a different location so if

00:00:37.320 --> 00:00:39.440 
starting at a different location so if
we<00:00:37.410> want<00:00:37.590> to<00:00:37.620> play<00:00:37.800> AE<00:00:37.980> flat<00:00:38.610> major<00:00:38.880> chord<00:00:39.270> we

00:00:39.440 --> 00:00:39.450 
we want to play AE flat major chord we

00:00:39.450 --> 00:00:45.619 
we want to play AE flat major chord we
can<00:00:39.600> simply<00:00:39.930> go<00:00:40.050> a<00:00:40.230> flat<00:00:40.530> G<00:00:40.800> and<00:00:41.550> B<00:00:41.579> flat<00:00:44.629> so

00:00:45.619 --> 00:00:45.629 
can simply go a flat G and B flat so

00:00:45.629 --> 00:00:47.330 
can simply go a flat G and B flat so
it's<00:00:45.750> very<00:00:45.899> simple<00:00:46.320> to<00:00:46.590> learn<00:00:46.860> how<00:00:47.129> to<00:00:47.160> play

00:00:47.330 --> 00:00:47.340 
it's very simple to learn how to play

00:00:47.340 --> 00:00:48.860 
it's very simple to learn how to play
music<00:00:47.399> and<00:00:47.879> also<00:00:48.120> to<00:00:48.180> think<00:00:48.570> in<00:00:48.750> a<00:00:48.840> different

00:00:48.860 --> 00:00:48.870 
music and also to think in a different

00:00:48.870 --> 00:00:51.319 
music and also to think in a different
way<00:00:49.320> because<00:00:49.590> the<00:00:50.039> notes<00:00:50.190> are<00:00:50.370> laid<00:00:50.550> out<00:00:50.579> based

00:00:51.319 --> 00:00:51.329 
way because the notes are laid out based

00:00:51.329 --> 00:00:54.500 
way because the notes are laid out based
on<00:00:51.510> their<00:00:51.690> harmonic<00:00:52.109> properties<00:00:53.420> next<00:00:54.420> I'd

00:00:54.500 --> 00:00:54.510 
on their harmonic properties next I'd

00:00:54.510 --> 00:00:55.910 
on their harmonic properties next I'd
like<00:00:54.570> to<00:00:54.660> show<00:00:54.780> you<00:00:54.930> some<00:00:55.109> of<00:00:55.230> our<00:00:55.320> instruments

00:00:55.910 --> 00:00:55.920 
like to show you some of our instruments

00:00:55.920 --> 00:00:58.670 
like to show you some of our instruments
so<00:00:56.399> that<00:00:56.430> was<00:00:56.609> our<00:00:56.760> accordion<00:00:57.359> sound<00:00:57.719> this<00:00:58.530> is

00:00:58.670 --> 00:00:58.680 
so that was our accordion sound this is

00:00:58.680 --> 00:01:00.080 
so that was our accordion sound this is
a<00:00:58.710> new<00:00:58.890> sound<00:00:59.160> we<00:00:59.280> have<00:00:59.399> for<00:00:59.579> music<00:00:59.850> stroke

00:01:00.080 --> 00:01:00.090 
a new sound we have for music stroke

00:01:00.090 --> 00:01:05.410 
a new sound we have for music stroke
called<00:01:00.300> a<00:01:00.420> Sonic

00:01:05.410 --> 00:01:05.420 

00:01:05.420 --> 00:01:07.520 

it<00:01:06.420> sounds<00:01:06.660> really<00:01:06.930> great<00:01:07.080> it<00:01:07.260> actually

00:01:07.520 --> 00:01:07.530 
it sounds really great it actually

00:01:07.530 --> 00:01:14.690 
it sounds really great it actually
really<00:01:07.950> low<00:01:08.130> notes

00:01:14.690 --> 00:01:14.700 

00:01:14.700 --> 00:01:16.649 

also<00:01:15.700> if<00:01:15.759> you<00:01:15.850> want<00:01:15.999> to<00:01:16.060> move<00:01:16.179> the<00:01:16.359> keyboard

00:01:16.649 --> 00:01:16.659 
also if you want to move the keyboard

00:01:16.659 --> 00:01:18.840 
also if you want to move the keyboard
around<00:01:17.200> to<00:01:17.289> get<00:01:17.439> different<00:01:17.770> notes<00:01:18.310> higher<00:01:18.579> and

00:01:18.840 --> 00:01:18.850 
around to get different notes higher and

00:01:18.850 --> 00:01:20.099 
around to get different notes higher and
lower<00:01:18.909> you<00:01:19.149> can<00:01:19.299> actually<00:01:19.420> just<00:01:19.750> grab<00:01:19.929> the

00:01:20.099 --> 00:01:20.109 
lower you can actually just grab the

00:01:20.109 --> 00:01:26.779 
lower you can actually just grab the
corners<00:01:20.409> and<00:01:20.560> drag<00:01:22.560> I'll<00:01:23.560> go<00:01:23.709> to<00:01:24.189> a<00:01:24.219> brass<00:01:24.729> note

00:01:26.779 --> 00:01:26.789 
corners and drag I'll go to a brass note

00:01:26.789 --> 00:01:29.370 
corners and drag I'll go to a brass note
I'll<00:01:27.789> check<00:01:28.060> out<00:01:28.209> square<00:01:28.479> Hamm's<00:01:28.780> can<00:01:29.109> I<00:01:29.200> got<00:01:29.350> a

00:01:29.370 --> 00:01:29.380 
I'll check out square Hamm's can I got a

00:01:29.380 --> 00:01:34.850 
I'll check out square Hamm's can I got a
nice<00:01:29.560> retro<00:01:29.979> feel<00:01:30.250> to<00:01:30.429> it

00:01:34.850 --> 00:01:34.860 

00:01:34.860 --> 00:01:42.990 

and<00:01:35.860> these<00:01:36.550> elephone<00:01:41.430> so<00:01:42.430> those<00:01:42.580> are<00:01:42.700> some<00:01:42.880> of

00:01:42.990 --> 00:01:43.000 
and these elephone so those are some of

00:01:43.000 --> 00:01:44.790 
and these elephone so those are some of
the<00:01:43.090> instruments<00:01:43.600> and<00:01:43.750> if<00:01:43.990> you<00:01:44.110> don't<00:01:44.320> like

00:01:44.790 --> 00:01:44.800 
the instruments and if you don't like

00:01:44.800 --> 00:01:46.680

there's always OSC or mini so with mini
you<00:01:51.430> can<00:01:51.460> actually<00:01:51.820> Kent<00:01:52.450> and<00:01:52.690> send<00:01:53.020> it<00:01:53.080> to<00:01:53.170> an

00:01:53.250 --> 00:01:53.260 
you can actually Kent and send it to an

00:01:53.260 --> 00:01:55.410 
you can actually Kent and send it to an
external<00:01:53.560> device<00:01:53.830> you<00:01:54.790> can<00:01:54.910> choose<00:01:55.150> whether

you want just a nice clean layout you
can<00:03:58.310> actually<00:03:58.430> remove<00:03:58.820> the<00:03:59.180> note<00:03:59.450> letters<00:03:59.780> all

00:04:00.010 --> 00:04:00.020 
can actually remove the note letters all

00:04:00.020 --> 00:04:03.940 
can actually remove the note letters all
together<00:04:01.330> we<00:04:02.330> also<00:04:02.480> added<00:04:02.660> some<00:04:02.950> coloring

00:04:03.940 --> 00:04:03.950 
together we also added some coloring

00:04:03.950 --> 00:04:06.010 
together we also added some coloring
systems<00:04:04.340> so<00:04:04.670> this<00:04:04.760> is<00:04:04.940> the<00:04:05.120> default<00:04:05.390> coloring

00:04:06.010 --> 00:04:06.020 
systems so this is the default coloring

00:04:06.020 --> 00:04:09.720 
systems so this is the default coloring
system<00:04:06.350> we<00:04:06.860> also<00:04:07.010> have<00:04:07.280> a<00:04:07.310> pastel<00:04:08.150> green<00:04:08.930> board

00:04:09.720 --> 00:04:09.730 
system we also have a pastel green board

00:04:09.730 --> 00:04:12.700 
system we also have a pastel green board
pastel<00:04:10.730> inverted<00:04:11.210> piano<00:04:11.660> so<00:04:12.020> this<00:04:12.140> is<00:04:12.290> very

00:04:12.700 --> 00:04:12.710 
pastel inverted piano so this is very

00:04:12.710 --> 00:04:16.920 
pastel inverted piano so this is very
similar<00:04:12.890> to<00:04:13.010> musics<00:04:14.050> rainbow<00:04:15.050> and<00:04:15.320> saturation

00:04:16.920 --> 00:04:16.930 
similar to musics rainbow and saturation

00:04:16.930 --> 00:04:19.120 
similar to musics rainbow and saturation
as<00:04:17.930> well<00:04:18.230> with<00:04:18.410> these<00:04:18.590> you<00:04:18.830> can<00:04:18.859> actually

00:04:19.120 --> 00:04:19.130 
as well with these you can actually

00:04:19.130 --> 00:04:22.030 
as well with these you can actually
darken<00:04:20.060> out<00:04:20.330> the<00:04:20.690> other<00:04:20.840> scale<00:04:21.200> notes<00:04:21.380> to<00:04:21.890> make

00:04:22.030 --> 00:04:22.040 
darken out the other scale notes to make

00:04:22.040 --> 00:04:23.860 
darken out the other scale notes to make
it<00:04:22.190> very<00:04:22.400> clear<00:04:22.580> which<00:04:23.150> notes<00:04:23.420> hurting<00:04:23.750> the

00:04:23.860 --> 00:04:23.870 
it very clear which notes hurting the

00:04:23.870 --> 00:04:26.200 
it very clear which notes hurting the
scale<00:04:24.140> and<00:04:24.380> what<00:04:24.530> you're<00:04:24.710> not<00:04:24.790> the<00:04:25.790> coloring

00:04:26.200 --> 00:04:26.210 
scale and what you're not the coloring

00:04:26.210 --> 00:04:27.070 
scale and what you're not the coloring
patterns<00:04:26.510> there's<00:04:26.660> actually<00:04:26.930> two<00:04:27.050> different

00:04:27.070 --> 00:04:27.080 
patterns there's actually two different

00:04:27.080 --> 00:04:29.350 
patterns there's actually two different
options<00:04:27.800> these<00:04:28.310> ones<00:04:28.490> are<00:04:28.580> based<00:04:28.760> on<00:04:28.970> static

00:04:29.350 --> 00:04:29.360 
options these ones are based on static

00:04:29.360 --> 00:04:31.330 
options these ones are based on static
notes<00:04:29.600> so<00:04:30.080> if<00:04:30.200> you<00:04:30.350> move<00:04:30.530> the<00:04:30.680> tonic<00:04:31.010> around

00:04:31.330 --> 00:04:31.340 
notes so if you move the tonic around

00:04:31.340 --> 00:04:34.600 
notes so if you move the tonic around
the<00:04:31.640> colors<00:04:32.000> of<00:04:32.180> the<00:04:32.270> notes<00:04:32.450> won't<00:04:32.660> change<00:04:33.610> top

00:04:34.600 --> 00:04:34.610 
the colors of the notes won't change top

00:04:34.610 --> 00:04:36.100 
the colors of the notes won't change top
ones<00:04:34.850> here<00:04:35.000> are<00:04:35.150> actually<00:04:35.600> based<00:04:35.810> on<00:04:35.990> the

00:04:36.100 --> 00:04:36.110 
ones here are actually based on the

00:04:36.110 --> 00:04:39.220 
ones here are actually based on the
tonic<00:04:36.380> so<00:04:36.710> if<00:04:36.800> you<00:04:36.920> change<00:04:37.520> from<00:04:37.820> AC<00:04:38.090> to<00:04:38.360> a<00:04:38.600> d<00:04:38.870> it

00:04:39.220 --> 00:04:39.230 
tonic so if you change from AC to a d it

00:04:39.230 --> 00:04:40.990 
tonic so if you change from AC to a d it
will<00:04:39.380> actually<00:04:39.560> change<00:04:40.040> the<00:04:40.280> colors<00:04:40.700> of<00:04:40.730> the

00:04:40.990 --> 00:04:41.000 
will actually change the colors of the

00:04:41.000 --> 00:04:45.340 
will actually change the colors of the
notes<00:04:41.180> as<00:04:41.360> well<00:04:42.460> finally<00:04:43.460> we<00:04:43.760> have<00:04:43.940> shapes<00:04:44.450> so

00:04:45.340 --> 00:04:45.350 
notes as well finally we have shapes so

00:04:45.350 --> 00:04:47.710 
notes as well finally we have shapes so
here<00:04:45.590> we<00:04:45.710> have<00:04:45.860> square<00:04:46.100> shapes<00:04:46.490> we<00:04:47.330> also<00:04:47.450> have

00:04:47.710 --> 00:04:47.720 
here we have square shapes we also have

00:04:47.720 --> 00:04:50.320 
here we have square shapes we also have
our<00:04:47.750> original<00:04:48.310> hexagon<00:04:49.310> shapes<00:04:49.640> and<00:04:49.880> we've

00:04:50.320 --> 00:04:50.330 
our original hexagon shapes and we've

00:04:50.330 --> 00:04:52.180 
our original hexagon shapes and we've
added<00:04:50.480> in<00:04:50.750> rectangles<00:04:51.470> as<00:04:51.620> well<00:04:51.800> so<00:04:52.010> you<00:04:52.100> can

00:04:52.180 --> 00:04:52.190 
added in rectangles as well so you can

00:04:52.190 --> 00:04:55.120 
added in rectangles as well so you can
actually<00:04:52.520> define<00:04:53.080> what<00:04:54.080> type<00:04:54.290> of<00:04:54.560> shape<00:04:54.890> you

00:04:55.120 --> 00:04:55.130 
actually define what type of shape you

00:04:55.130 --> 00:05:02.320 
actually define what type of shape you
want<00:04:55.340> your<00:04:55.460> notes<00:04:55.669> to<00:04:55.940> be<00:05:00.940> and<00:05:01.940> then<00:05:02.090> you<00:05:02.180> have

00:05:02.320 --> 00:05:02.330 
want your notes to be and then you have

00:05:02.330 --> 00:05:04.420 
want your notes to be and then you have
node<00:05:02.510> overlap<00:05:02.960> so<00:05:03.560> this<00:05:03.680> allows<00:05:03.919> you<00:05:04.100> to<00:05:04.190> play

00:05:04.420 --> 00:05:04.430 
node overlap so this allows you to play

00:05:04.430 --> 00:05:06.430 
node overlap so this allows you to play
more<00:05:04.730> than<00:05:04.790> one<00:05:05.000> note<00:05:05.450> at<00:05:05.900> a<00:05:05.990> time<00:05:06.020> with<00:05:06.410> a

00:05:06.430 --> 00:05:06.440 
more than one note at a time with a

00:05:06.440 --> 00:05:09.040 
more than one note at a time with a
single<00:05:06.680> finger<00:05:06.980> so<00:05:07.790> you<00:05:07.820> can<00:05:08.000> see<00:05:08.180> that<00:05:08.870> the

00:05:09.040 --> 00:05:09.050 
single finger so you can see that the

00:05:09.050 --> 00:05:11.350 
single finger so you can see that the
green<00:05:09.320> area<00:05:09.680> is<00:05:09.919> a<00:05:09.950> single<00:05:10.580> note<00:05:10.730> and<00:05:11.000> the<00:05:11.150> blue

00:05:11.350 --> 00:05:11.360 
green area is a single note and the blue

00:05:11.360 --> 00:05:13.090 
green area is a single note and the blue
area<00:05:11.690> is<00:05:11.750> actually<00:05:12.169> contacting<00:05:12.770> the<00:05:12.890> notes

00:05:13.090 --> 00:05:13.100 
area is actually contacting the notes

00:05:13.100 --> 00:05:17.260 
area is actually contacting the notes
around<00:05:13.340> it<00:05:13.790> so<00:05:14.780> if<00:05:14.930> I<00:05:15.080> go<00:05:15.290> to<00:05:15.350> a<00:05:16.270> harmonic

00:05:17.260 --> 00:05:17.270 
around it so if I go to a harmonic

00:05:17.270 --> 00:05:19.210 
around it so if I go to a harmonic
layout<00:05:17.840> we<00:05:18.050> can<00:05:18.169> actually<00:05:18.440> play<00:05:18.590> AC<00:05:18.830> major

00:05:19.210 --> 00:05:19.220 
layout we can actually play AC major

00:05:19.220 --> 00:05:20.709 
layout we can actually play AC major
chord

00:05:20.709 --> 00:05:20.719 
chord

00:05:20.719 --> 00:05:26.760 
chord
with<00:05:21.439> one<00:05:21.679> finger

00:05:26.760 --> 00:05:26.770 

00:05:26.770 --> 00:05:32.430 

and<00:05:27.539> that<00:05:28.539> is<00:05:28.720> not--<00:05:28.990> overlap<00:05:30.810> and<00:05:31.810> then<00:05:32.319> if

00:05:32.430 --> 00:05:32.440 
and that is not-- overlap and then if

00:05:32.440 --> 00:05:34.740 
and that is not-- overlap and then if
you<00:05:32.530> want<00:05:32.710> to<00:05:32.770> play<00:05:32.949> around<00:05:33.099> more<00:05:33.490> yet<00:05:33.729> you<00:05:34.599> can

00:05:34.740 --> 00:05:34.750 
you want to play around more yet you can

00:05:34.750 --> 00:05:37.589 
you want to play around more yet you can
actually<00:05:35.139> customize<00:05:35.440> the<00:05:35.910> layouts<00:05:36.910> to<00:05:37.360> your

00:05:37.589 --> 00:05:37.599 
actually customize the layouts to your

00:05:37.599 --> 00:05:41.010 
actually customize the layouts to your
own<00:05:37.810> preference<00:05:38.770> so<00:05:39.490> if<00:05:39.759> you<00:05:39.970> want<00:05:40.240> a<00:05:40.599> perfect

00:05:41.010 --> 00:05:41.020 
own preference so if you want a perfect

00:05:41.020 --> 00:05:43.409 
own preference so if you want a perfect
fifth<00:05:41.440> in<00:05:42.039> this<00:05:42.250> direction<00:05:42.490> from<00:05:42.910> the<00:05:43.090> tonic

00:05:43.409 --> 00:05:43.419 
fifth in this direction from the tonic

00:05:43.419 --> 00:05:46.529 
fifth in this direction from the tonic
and<00:05:43.919> you<00:05:44.919> want<00:05:45.160> a<00:05:45.340> major<00:05:45.639> second<00:05:46.180> in<00:05:46.389> that

00:05:46.529 --> 00:05:46.539 
and you want a major second in that

00:05:46.539 --> 00:05:49.320 
and you want a major second in that
direction<00:05:46.750> you<00:05:47.710> can<00:05:47.979> essentially<00:05:48.639> learn<00:05:49.030> and

00:05:49.320 --> 00:05:49.330 
direction you can essentially learn and

00:05:49.330 --> 00:05:51.809 
direction you can essentially learn and
play<00:05:49.449> with<00:05:50.440> isomorphic<00:05:51.009> layouts<00:05:51.340> to<00:05:51.520> create

00:05:51.809 --> 00:05:51.819 
play with isomorphic layouts to create

00:05:51.819 --> 00:05:54.360 
play with isomorphic layouts to create
ones<00:05:52.030> that<00:05:52.270> suit<00:05:52.569> your<00:05:52.870> needs<00:05:53.169> and<00:05:53.500> if<00:05:54.250> you

00:05:54.360 --> 00:05:54.370 
ones that suit your needs and if you

00:05:54.370 --> 00:05:56.159 
ones that suit your needs and if you
have<00:05:54.520> tiny<00:05:54.940> fingers<00:05:55.330> and<00:05:55.539> want<00:05:55.660> thousands<00:05:56.080> of

have tiny fingers and want thousands of

00:05:56.169 --> 00:05:58.860 
have tiny fingers and want thousands of

00:06:01.469 --> 00:06:01.479 
have giant fingers you can make epic

00:06:01.479 --> 00:06:03.719 
have giant fingers you can make epic
