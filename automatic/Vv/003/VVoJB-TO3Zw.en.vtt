00:00:01.280 --> 00:00:06.240
 Tell me, my name is Felipe. 

00:00:04.319 --> 00:00:09.570
 today I want to give a line about 

00:00:06.240 --> 00:00:12.120
 automated transmission 

00:00:09.570 --> 00:00:17.080
 in this case here is an exchange of logic 

00:00:12.120 --> 00:00:20.330
 of fiat in 2012 

00:00:17.080 --> 00:00:23.120
 and the problem reported by the client 

00:00:20.330 --> 00:00:27.080
 was that the paul in the reduced of the fourth 

00:00:23.120 --> 00:00:29.240
 for the third the car engages third 

00:00:27.080 --> 00:00:32.840
 and does not engage the second in the reduced 

00:00:29.240 --> 00:00:34.820
 he gets stuck on the 3rd to take the 

00:00:32.840 --> 00:00:36.710
 third party has to engage the 

00:00:34.820 --> 00:00:38.660
 put it back again so he 

00:00:36.710 --> 00:00:40.540
 go back to 1st gear 

00:00:38.660 --> 00:00:43.820
 so before I talk about the problem 

00:00:40.540 --> 00:00:45.680
 I'm going to talk about this car. 

00:00:43.820 --> 00:00:48.290
 A little lesson, go if that 

00:00:45.680 --> 00:00:50.060
 each component how does the 

00:00:48.290 --> 00:00:52.670
 automated exchange 

00:00:50.060 --> 00:00:54.890
 in this case of logic here, but also the 

00:00:52.670 --> 00:00:56.930
 principle of the in motion of volkswagen is 

00:00:54.890 --> 00:00:59.750
 another example is that the chevrolet the same 

00:00:56.930 --> 00:01:02.000
 principle of the manufacturer of that 

00:00:59.750 --> 00:01:04.489
 magneti marelli for all of them 

00:01:02.000 --> 00:01:06.830
 then the principle is the same I go 

00:01:04.489 --> 00:01:09.680
 explain that time means that each 

00:01:06.830 --> 00:01:11.360
 ask each component a little bit of the 

00:01:09.680 --> 00:01:12.410
 basic tests you can do in 

00:01:11.360 --> 00:01:14.119
 stand 

00:01:12.410 --> 00:01:18.640
 It's cool that the exchange is dismantled. 

00:01:14.119 --> 00:01:18.640
 Here at the table, then, let's go. 

00:01:19.680 --> 00:01:24.720
 well come on first step I want 

00:01:22.200 --> 00:01:28.080
 explain here is a component of the exchange rate 

00:01:24.720 --> 00:01:30.140
 robotized is that we have here we 

00:01:28.080 --> 00:01:33.000
 we have an oil reservoir in the 

00:01:30.140 --> 00:01:34.190
 reservoir that carries the tutela oil without 

00:01:33.000 --> 00:01:37.260
 these fitch 

00:01:34.190 --> 00:01:39.810
 no other type of oil just this self 

00:01:37.260 --> 00:01:42.300
 I've seen people putting on another type of oil 

00:01:39.810 --> 00:01:46.140
 here it has damaged changes and is only 

00:01:42.300 --> 00:01:49.350
 Death is an expensive oil over the 100 reais 

00:01:46.140 --> 00:01:51.660
 and should not be used 

00:01:49.350 --> 00:01:54.030
 type of oil just want to make this okay 

00:01:51.660 --> 00:01:57.899
 Zado and fat that just this kind of 

00:01:54.030 --> 00:01:59.430
 order is but we have here we have to 

00:01:57.899 --> 00:02:01.770
 bomb 

00:01:59.430 --> 00:02:04.080
 pump that generates oil pressure in the 

00:02:01.770 --> 00:02:05.790
 system with the oil pressure 

00:02:04.080 --> 00:02:09.360
 works the singer system baptized 

00:02:05.790 --> 00:02:10.560
 from 37 to 45 bar pressure a pressure 

00:02:09.360 --> 00:02:14.610
 very high 

00:02:10.560 --> 00:02:17.580
 It's cool and in this play, this is the 

00:02:14.610 --> 00:02:20.520
 accumulation of pressure for the purpose 

00:02:17.580 --> 00:02:22.709
 that cause the pump to 

00:02:20.520 --> 00:02:24.810
 keep working full time 

00:02:22.709 --> 00:02:27.150
 it accumulates residual pressure here 

00:02:24.810 --> 00:02:28.769
 inside that the few are dissipating 

00:02:27.150 --> 00:02:29.820
 the system so that to prevent the 

00:02:28.769 --> 00:02:33.390
 electric pump stayed the whole time 

00:02:29.820 --> 00:02:35.489
 I do not know if anyone already has a 

00:02:33.390 --> 00:02:38.549
 has already realized that when you 

00:02:35.489 --> 00:02:41.700
 you find it from time to time or 

00:02:38.549 --> 00:02:43.260
 that noise in me is not the noise 

00:02:41.700 --> 00:02:46.110
 middle of a little robot is the bomb 

00:02:43.260 --> 00:02:48.360
 working then that little noise him 

00:02:46.110 --> 00:02:50.519
 makes for pump work and for 

00:02:48.360 --> 00:02:53.640
 work because it completes the 

00:02:50.519 --> 00:02:56.790
 pressure buildup, how do we 

00:02:53.640 --> 00:02:59.370
 tests pressure buildup only 

00:02:56.790 --> 00:03:00.360
 weighing him because he's a play 

00:02:59.370 --> 00:03:02.940
 armored 

00:03:00.360 --> 00:03:06.690
 there's no way you can open it and inside it 

00:03:02.940 --> 00:03:09.299
 has a diaphragm this diaphragm can 

00:03:06.690 --> 00:03:12.060
 occur when it burst and when it 

00:03:09.299 --> 00:03:14.700
 cry the year it enters the 

00:03:12.060 --> 00:03:15.650
 accumulator is and makes it more 

00:03:14.700 --> 00:03:19.120
 heavy 

00:03:15.650 --> 00:03:21.819
 so for whom I have already repaired 

00:03:19.120 --> 00:03:24.819
 a hint this pressure build up the weight 

00:03:21.819 --> 00:03:29.200
 of it a functional one piece of this good 

00:03:24.819 --> 00:03:31.950
 varies around 660 grams when 

00:03:29.200 --> 00:03:34.659
 damaged it can get up to a pound 

00:03:31.950 --> 00:03:36.099
 900 grams a pound up to a little over 

00:03:34.659 --> 00:03:37.810
 one kilogram 

00:03:36.099 --> 00:03:40.780
 so this is how you test by accumulating the 

00:03:37.810 --> 00:03:44.670
 good expression in this particular range 

00:03:40.780 --> 00:03:47.319
 I'll talk a little about the theft. 

00:03:44.670 --> 00:03:49.659
 Good now to talk a little bit about 

00:03:47.319 --> 00:03:52.440
 cool grandpa himself 

00:03:49.659 --> 00:03:59.620
 so what we have here we have 

00:03:52.440 --> 00:04:02.280
 sensor solenoids and a good price 

00:03:59.620 --> 00:04:06.129
 What is the function of this new story? 

00:04:02.280 --> 00:04:08.019
 Libya the passage of the marches 

00:04:06.129 --> 00:04:11.859
 it will release the oil flow so that 

00:04:08.019 --> 00:04:14.319
 the ox gatti the mafias, then we have 

00:04:11.859 --> 00:04:15.730
 here are simple solenoids and they have 

00:04:14.319 --> 00:04:18.220
 name is 

00:04:15.730 --> 00:04:20.470
 we have our magela which is 

00:04:18.220 --> 00:04:22.270
 responsible for the polisher when listening 

00:04:20.470 --> 00:04:26.110
 releases oil or hydraulic glue 

00:04:22.270 --> 00:04:28.930
 we have the sony the night it serves 1 and 2 that 

00:04:26.110 --> 00:04:32.340
 it's just the night of engagement and 

00:04:28.930 --> 00:04:37.060
 solenoids r3 and r4 samsung hai 

00:04:32.340 --> 00:04:40.360
 selection and we have the sensors 

00:04:37.060 --> 00:04:43.750
 position of the selection and 

00:04:40.360 --> 00:04:45.400
 choice of the coupling overloop then 

00:04:43.750 --> 00:04:47.919
 basic test you can do with a 

00:04:45.400 --> 00:04:49.720
 bench to see at least one 

00:04:47.919 --> 00:04:53.290
 Little good dealers here 

00:04:49.720 --> 00:04:56.980
 testing her resistance in this 

00:04:53.290 --> 00:04:59.830
 Deaths here is zero is seeing a r 2 

00:04:56.980 --> 00:05:04.660
 they have a resistance ranging from 2 

00:04:59.830 --> 00:05:06.190
 to 10 years and to r 304 from 4 to 11 years 

00:05:04.660 --> 00:05:08.680
 so I'm going to take a teaching test 

00:05:06.190 --> 00:05:11.050
 basic here with the team that only you 

00:05:08.680 --> 00:05:14.830
 to see the resistance that is under 

00:05:11.050 --> 00:05:17.820
 analysis leave the last problem is that 

00:05:14.830 --> 00:05:17.820
 you consider 

00:05:21.449 --> 00:05:28.680
 good we have three men here 3 thousand to 4 

00:05:25.279 --> 00:05:30.800
 is far from the standard either of two 

00:05:28.680 --> 00:05:34.330
 aircraft 

00:05:30.800 --> 00:05:34.330
 the snippet after someone 

00:05:36.409 --> 00:05:44.569
 in old lady I think she loves 3,4 too 

00:05:42.219 --> 00:05:46.699
 and she is here will not find a 

00:05:44.569 --> 00:05:49.939
 slightly higher resistance 

00:05:46.699 --> 00:05:52.959
 to achieve this from here, which is a 

00:05:49.939 --> 00:05:52.959
 selection hitch 

00:05:52.999 --> 00:05:58.659
 they work from 4 to 12 years 

00:05:55.519 --> 00:05:58.659
 They will not find it here. 

00:06:00.190 --> 00:06:08.950
 six organs 5,9 

00:06:03.190 --> 00:06:11.710
 also that other is not 5.9 

00:06:08.950 --> 00:06:13.090
 means that bench tests 

00:06:11.710 --> 00:06:15.280
 Those are just us 

00:06:13.090 --> 00:06:19.690
 so everything okay, it shows that she does not 

00:06:15.280 --> 00:06:23.620
 has an electrical defect but the defect 

00:06:19.690 --> 00:06:26.440
 mechanic can happen may show that 

00:06:23.620 --> 00:06:31.090
 this story of car robbery from 

00:06:26.440 --> 00:06:34.170
 my client and sound that is sewer that 

00:06:31.090 --> 00:06:36.520
 it happened with this robbery 

00:06:34.170 --> 00:06:38.530
 water got inside him 

00:06:36.520 --> 00:06:41.680
 do not ask me how it happened 

00:06:38.530 --> 00:06:46.030
 because he stole his side was full of 

00:06:41.680 --> 00:06:48.130
 What happened to the water robot? 

00:06:46.030 --> 00:06:50.260
 mixed with oil, oil lost its 

00:06:48.130 --> 00:06:51.610
 Are you okay and have not done it? 

00:06:50.260 --> 00:06:55.180
 exact lubrication 

00:06:51.610 --> 00:06:57.730
 So it happened at the filing show then 

00:06:55.180 --> 00:06:59.560
 his whole system came and 

00:06:57.730 --> 00:07:01.630
 advisory shops here are all 

00:06:59.560 --> 00:07:03.250
 condemned because they are all 

00:07:01.630 --> 00:07:05.919
 full of filing so I can not 

00:07:03.250 --> 00:07:09.070
 work with one with your image of that 

00:07:05.919 --> 00:07:10.600
 type here then in this case here the exchange 

00:07:09.070 --> 00:07:12.130
 It is damned to her how much she is 

00:07:10.600 --> 00:07:15.520
 convicted has to be made 

00:07:12.130 --> 00:07:17.980
 substitution for another is legal that is 

00:07:15.520 --> 00:07:21.490
 a car problem of her lot of water 

00:07:17.980 --> 00:07:23.919
 here you can see the evil used here 

00:07:21.490 --> 00:07:26.169
 even this brown color here is as if 

00:07:23.919 --> 00:07:28.990
 was a government water mud that 

00:07:26.169 --> 00:07:30.700
 came in a rusty table and can not 

00:07:28.990 --> 00:07:31.870
 see in the video but when you pass the hand 

00:07:30.700 --> 00:07:34.840
 here we only of us 

00:07:31.870 --> 00:07:36.729
 you guys feel pretty maliki the model 

00:07:34.840 --> 00:07:38.349
 very excited even 

00:07:36.729 --> 00:07:39.759
 so we are here totally 

00:07:38.349 --> 00:07:41.710
 condemnable 

00:07:39.759 --> 00:07:44.050
 What will be the solution for her car? 

00:07:41.710 --> 00:07:48.189
 I'll put the robbery or if it's the one 

00:07:44.050 --> 00:07:50.499
 with my mother too, new bomb everything 

00:07:48.189 --> 00:07:53.949
 new so much that is the complete set 

00:07:50.499 --> 00:07:55.809
 Paul will be fine again then ok 

00:07:53.949 --> 00:07:57.879
 a basic line on the exchange rate 

00:07:55.809 --> 00:08:00.430
 robotized logic remembering again 

00:07:57.879 --> 00:08:02.469
 that the electronic immochan is the same 

00:08:00.430 --> 00:08:04.809
 thing pretty much the same thing 

00:08:02.469 --> 00:08:07.599
 It is cool if you like the video gives 

00:08:04.809 --> 00:08:09.999
 like subscribes to the shared channel 

00:08:07.599 --> 00:08:13.349
 I liked it, it helped spread our 

00:08:09.999 --> 00:08:13.349
 hug channel
