00:00:00.500 --> 00:00:06.420
 Hi guys, you asked me to teach. 

00:00:04.259 --> 00:00:07.649
 do the owl's marker and today I go 

00:00:06.420 --> 00:00:09.540
 teach 

00:00:07.649 --> 00:00:12.240
 first you need to get a piece 

00:00:09.540 --> 00:00:15.660
 a sheet of paper that 

00:00:12.240 --> 00:00:18.020
 Be the firmer answer here I do not know 

00:00:15.660 --> 00:00:21.630
 What role is this so do not ask me 

00:00:18.020 --> 00:00:25.529
 and to make four squares of eight 

00:00:21.630 --> 00:00:29.010
 another made by eight centimeters and 

00:00:25.529 --> 00:00:33.059
 then the top and bottom squares 

00:00:29.010 --> 00:00:45.149
 everything divided in the middle will stay like this 

00:00:33.059 --> 00:00:46.110
 It's going to stay there so you can see there you go 

00:00:45.149 --> 00:00:50.610
 remember 

00:00:46.110 --> 00:00:54.149
 so the parts painted here that do not 

00:00:50.610 --> 00:00:56.039
 There must be a lot of good, but that's it or 

00:00:54.149 --> 00:00:57.840
 This is gonna cut it's gonna stay. 

00:00:56.039 --> 00:01:03.320
 looking like a flag of Sao Joao 

00:00:57.840 --> 00:01:03.320
 so it 'll be like this 

00:01:05.740 --> 00:01:12.200
 It will look like a flag of Sao Joao. 

00:01:09.740 --> 00:01:15.970
 haiti folds the parts here are 

00:01:12.200 --> 00:01:30.890
 marked to check if 

00:01:15.970 --> 00:01:35.510
 fold is the same thing on the other side 

00:01:30.890 --> 00:01:37.700
 It will be closed and he will stay. 

00:01:35.510 --> 00:01:40.070
 yes and from there 

00:01:37.700 --> 00:01:44.470
 ae 

00:01:40.070 --> 00:01:44.470
 here are the parts of Brazil 

00:01:48.229 --> 00:01:59.060
 to itu with this part here that part that 

00:01:53.020 --> 00:02:02.330
 In this one now that you've pasted your 

00:01:59.060 --> 00:02:04.160
 let it dry that this part here goes 

00:02:02.330 --> 00:02:07.670
 be the part that will stay within your 

00:02:04.160 --> 00:02:11.860
 book is to secure page however leaves 

00:02:07.670 --> 00:02:15.790
 drying and let's do the little owl 

00:02:11.860 --> 00:02:18.200
 I have here only the draft of the owl 

00:02:15.790 --> 00:02:20.930
 so I'd rather paint her for later 

00:02:18.200 --> 00:02:23.350
 around then painted the color you 

00:02:20.930 --> 00:02:23.350
 want to 

00:02:39.000 --> 00:02:42.000
 ae 

00:02:53.930 --> 00:02:56.930
 i 

00:03:35.519 --> 00:03:38.519
 ae 

00:04:43.750 --> 00:04:51.110
 It's going to be like that, it's not me. 

00:04:48.350 --> 00:04:52.880
 I do not know the colors is that it was the only one 

00:04:51.110 --> 00:04:57.490
 two pencils I found 

00:04:52.880 --> 00:04:57.490
 so I made a greal owl 

00:04:58.100 --> 00:05:04.850
 So folks, I advise you to stick a 

00:05:02.150 --> 00:05:06.800
 drawing on a firmer paper of the same 

00:05:04.850 --> 00:05:08.720
 The way you played the same role 

00:05:06.800 --> 00:05:11.270
 to make the marker 

00:05:08.720 --> 00:05:14.660
 paste the drawing because it is easier to 

00:05:11.270 --> 00:05:17.600
 to paint a paper on the drawing sheet 

00:05:14.660 --> 00:05:20.479
 Even if you do not do it, you do not 

00:05:17.600 --> 00:05:24.139
 It is firm enough so as has 

00:05:20.479 --> 00:05:26.210
 part with the little ears and I am and 

00:05:24.139 --> 00:05:28.760
 twig that will stay out of the marker 

00:05:26.210 --> 00:05:34.699
 so I advise you to put a sheet 

00:05:28.760 --> 00:05:40.160
 But son he later you cut it out 

00:05:34.699 --> 00:05:44.660
 will be cut so you right handle al 

00:05:40.160 --> 00:05:50.000
 the average marker that is where 

00:05:44.660 --> 00:05:54.910
 want the owl to stay and make a 

00:05:50.000 --> 00:05:58.849
 brand where you will cut it 

00:05:54.910 --> 00:06:05.120
 understand our problem painted in the 

00:05:58.849 --> 00:06:07.699
 owl but let's go how much owl 

00:06:05.120 --> 00:06:11.870
 divided in the middle everything will roll part of 

00:06:07.699 --> 00:06:15.349
 down here pretty well yields well coladinha 

00:06:11.870 --> 00:06:18.470
 with the marker input and the 

00:06:15.349 --> 00:06:26.210
 Above the owl, you're going to put it on top . 

00:06:18.470 --> 00:06:28.430
 it is closed then understand a necklace and 

00:06:26.210 --> 00:06:33.250
 this will be the end result of your 

00:06:28.430 --> 00:06:33.250
 closed marker he is a little owl 

00:06:34.210 --> 00:06:46.900
 It 's difficult and it's only breast and it's going to be 

00:06:44.530 --> 00:06:50.020
 a bookmark 

00:06:46.900 --> 00:06:54.550
 then this is it anything 

00:06:50.020 --> 00:06:56.590
 leave in comments and if you want 

00:06:54.550 --> 00:07:02.340
 I do some other tutorial of some 

00:06:56.590 --> 00:07:02.340
 Another thing, just ask brigade, bye.
