00:03:24.380 --> 00:03:24.390 
when you just rap I wrap them very

00:03:24.390 --> 00:03:36.650 
when you just rap I wrap them very
closely<00:03:24.720> you<00:03:25.170> just<00:03:25.380> wrap<00:03:28.790> all<00:03:29.790> the<00:03:30.060> way<00:03:30.240> down

00:03:36.650 --> 00:03:36.660 

00:03:36.660 --> 00:03:40.070 

you<00:03:37.350> can<00:03:37.560> see<00:03:37.800> how<00:03:37.950> it's<00:03:38.100> looking<00:03:38.370> like<00:03:39.360> your

00:03:40.070 --> 00:03:40.080 
you can see how it's looking like your

00:03:40.080 --> 00:03:43.030 
you can see how it's looking like your
hair<00:03:40.290> is<00:03:40.560> in<00:03:40.590> dreadlocks

00:03:43.030 --> 00:03:43.040 
hair is in dreadlocks

00:03:43.040 --> 00:03:46.870 
hair is in dreadlocks
this<00:03:44.040> is<00:03:44.190> how<00:03:44.340> you<00:03:44.400> achieve<00:03:44.610> that<00:03:45.230> without

00:03:46.870 --> 00:03:46.880 
this is how you achieve that without

00:03:46.880 --> 00:04:08.710 
this is how you achieve that without
going<00:03:47.880> to<00:03:48.180> the<00:03:48.210> actual<00:03:48.660> process

00:04:08.710 --> 00:04:08.720 

00:04:08.720 --> 00:04:11.920 

and<00:04:09.320> you<00:04:09.500> when<00:04:09.770> you<00:04:09.800> about<00:04:10.100> down<00:04:10.520> here<00:04:10.580> I<00:04:11.330> hold

00:04:11.920 --> 00:04:11.930 
and you when you about down here I hold

00:04:11.930 --> 00:04:14.620 
and you when you about down here I hold
it<00:04:12.220> then<00:04:13.220> I<00:04:13.340> grab<00:04:13.550> another<00:04:13.790> piece<00:04:14.120> to<00:04:14.360> finish

00:04:14.620 --> 00:04:14.630 
it then I grab another piece to finish

00:04:14.630 --> 00:04:18.550 
it then I grab another piece to finish
the<00:04:14.900> rest<00:04:15.140> of<00:04:15.470> the<00:04:15.620> braid<00:04:17.140> and<00:04:18.140> then<00:04:18.290> do<00:04:18.440> the

00:04:18.550 --> 00:04:18.560 
the rest of the braid and then do the

00:04:18.560 --> 00:04:22.270 
the rest of the braid and then do the
same<00:04:18.769> thing<00:04:20.140> take<00:04:21.140> one<00:04:21.380> end<00:04:21.680> of<00:04:21.830> it

00:04:22.270 --> 00:04:22.280 
same thing take one end of it

00:04:22.280 --> 00:04:25.810 
same thing take one end of it
put<00:04:23.120> it<00:04:23.210> against<00:04:23.570> your<00:04:23.810> hair<00:04:24.220> like<00:04:25.220> this<00:04:25.520> that

00:04:25.810 --> 00:04:25.820 
put it against your hair like this that

00:04:25.820 --> 00:04:28.960 
put it against your hair like this that
way<00:04:25.970> it<00:04:26.180> acts<00:04:27.110> like<00:04:27.350> a<00:04:27.500> lock<00:04:27.890> mechanism<00:04:28.130> to<00:04:28.850> you

00:04:28.960 --> 00:04:28.970 
way it acts like a lock mechanism to you

00:04:28.970 --> 00:04:31.180 
way it acts like a lock mechanism to you
cuz<00:04:29.750> you're<00:04:29.870> gonna<00:04:29.990> braid<00:04:30.320> over<00:04:30.500> that<00:04:30.800> base<00:04:31.010> so

00:04:31.180 --> 00:04:31.190 
cuz you're gonna braid over that base so

00:04:31.190 --> 00:04:33.040 
cuz you're gonna braid over that base so
it<00:04:31.340> won't<00:04:31.550> slide<00:04:31.790> down<00:04:32.120> or<00:04:32.480> anything

00:04:33.040 --> 00:04:33.050 
it won't slide down or anything

00:04:33.050 --> 00:04:35.890 
it won't slide down or anything
you'll<00:04:34.010> be<00:04:34.190> on<00:04:34.310> there<00:04:34.520> tight<00:04:34.760> and<00:04:35.750> you

00:04:35.890 --> 00:04:35.900 
you'll be on there tight and you

00:04:35.900 --> 00:05:07.670 
you'll be on there tight and you
continue<00:04:36.790> wrapping<00:04:37.790> around<00:04:40.660> way<00:04:41.660> down

00:05:07.670 --> 00:05:07.680 

00:05:07.680 --> 00:05:10.620 

this<00:05:08.680> is<00:05:08.860> the<00:05:08.980> boring<00:05:09.310> part<00:05:09.340> but<00:05:10.180> while<00:05:10.330> you<00:05:10.450> do

00:05:10.620 --> 00:05:10.630 
this is the boring part but while you do

00:05:10.630 --> 00:05:12.450 
this is the boring part but while you do
this<00:05:10.720> you<00:05:10.900> can<00:05:10.930> be<00:05:11.080> listening<00:05:11.620> to<00:05:11.710> music<00:05:12.190> or

00:05:12.450 --> 00:05:12.460 
this you can be listening to music or

00:05:12.460 --> 00:05:16.350 
this you can be listening to music or
watching<00:05:12.520> TV<00:05:13.950> to<00:05:14.950> get<00:05:15.130> this<00:05:15.340> time<00:05:15.610> another

00:05:16.350 --> 00:05:16.360 
watching TV to get this time another

00:05:16.360 --> 00:05:17.700 
watching TV to get this time another
thing<00:05:16.660> I<00:05:16.780> did<00:05:17.050> because<00:05:17.410> I'm<00:05:17.560> very

00:05:17.700 --> 00:05:17.710 
thing I did because I'm very

00:05:17.710 --> 00:05:18.480 
thing I did because I'm very
tender-headed

00:05:18.480 --> 00:05:18.490 
tender-headed

00:05:18.490 --> 00:05:20.910 
tender-headed
I<00:05:18.670> first<00:05:19.390> braid<00:05:19.660> my<00:05:19.870> hair<00:05:19.900> and<00:05:20.380> I<00:05:20.470> just<00:05:20.500> wear

the braids out

00:05:22.090 --> 00:05:24.660 
the braids out
it<00:05:22.450> looks<00:05:22.660> like<00:05:22.780> box<00:05:23.110> braids<00:05:23.500> and<00:05:24.400> then<00:05:24.640> a

00:05:24.660 --> 00:05:24.670 
it looks like box braids and then a

00:05:24.670 --> 00:05:26.760 
it looks like box braids and then a
couple<00:05:24.970> of<00:05:25.150> days<00:05:25.300> later<00:05:25.690> a<00:05:25.780> few<00:05:25.990> days<00:05:26.140> later<00:05:26.440> I

00:05:26.760 --> 00:05:26.770 
couple of days later a few days later I

00:05:26.770 --> 00:05:30.030 
couple of days later a few days later I
wrapped<00:05:27.430> my<00:05:27.640> hair<00:05:28.590> because<00:05:29.590> this<00:05:29.740> is<00:05:29.800> like

00:05:30.030 --> 00:05:30.040 
wrapped my hair because this is like

00:05:30.040 --> 00:05:33.420 
wrapped my hair because this is like
2001<00:05:31.080> you<00:05:32.080> can<00:05:32.260> some<00:05:32.440> people<00:05:32.470> twist<00:05:33.010> her<00:05:33.190> hair

00:05:33.420 --> 00:05:33.430 
2001 you can some people twist her hair

00:05:33.430 --> 00:05:36.540 
2001 you can some people twist her hair

00:05:36.540 --> 00:05:36.550 
too so when you get at the bottom you

00:05:36.550 --> 00:05:38.160 
too so when you get at the bottom you
know<00:05:36.700> if<00:05:36.790> your<00:05:36.910> braids<00:05:37.150> you<00:05:37.420> just<00:05:37.630> fold<00:05:37.930> the

00:05:38.160 --> 00:05:38.170 
know if your braids you just fold the

00:05:38.170 --> 00:05:41.220 
know if your braids you just fold the
little<00:05:38.320> tail<00:05:38.560> up<00:05:38.860> and<00:05:39.360> now<00:05:40.360> you<00:05:40.420> start<00:05:40.810> it<00:05:40.960> you

00:05:41.220 --> 00:05:41.230 
little tail up and now you start it you

00:05:41.230 --> 00:05:48.270 
little tail up and now you start it you
start<00:05:41.530> twisting<00:05:42.100> it<00:05:42.160> up<00:05:42.690> going<00:05:43.690> upward<00:05:47.220> so<00:05:48.220> you

00:05:48.270 --> 00:05:48.280 
start twisting it up going upward so you

00:05:48.280 --> 00:05:53.730 
start twisting it up going upward so you
twist<00:05:48.550> it<00:05:48.880> back<00:05:49.090> up<00:05:51.870> until<00:05:52.870> this<00:05:53.230> piece<00:05:53.530> of

00:05:53.730 --> 00:05:53.740 
twist it back up until this piece of

00:05:53.740 --> 00:05:58.380 
twist it back up until this piece of
hair<00:05:54.070> it's<00:05:55.000> done<00:05:56.310> and<00:05:57.310> just<00:05:57.850> give<00:05:58.090> you<00:05:58.210> like<00:05:58.360> a

00:06:13.200 --> 00:06:13.210 

00:06:13.210 --> 00:06:18.700

and what you do we get a lighter like
this<00:06:18.980> ain't<00:06:19.400> burn<00:06:19.790> again<00:06:22.330> so<00:06:23.330> it<00:06:23.630> can<00:06:23.840> stay<00:06:25.030> and

00:06:26.020 --> 00:06:26.030 
this ain't burn again so it can stay and
