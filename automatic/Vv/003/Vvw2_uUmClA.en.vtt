00:00:33.470 --> 00:00:33.480 
anyway the French Grand Prix the lights

00:00:33.480 --> 00:00:37.250 
anyway the French Grand Prix the lights
are<00:00:33.719> out<00:00:34.640> and<00:00:35.640> away<00:00:35.940> we<00:00:36.120> go<00:00:36.149> here<00:00:36.719> in<00:00:36.840> France

00:00:37.250 --> 00:00:37.260

00:00:37.260 --> 00:00:39.410 
are out and away we go here in France
14th<00:00:37.980> places<00:00:38.460> where<00:00:38.640> we<00:00:38.760> start<00:00:39.120> but<00:00:39.329> I<00:00:39.390> think

00:00:39.410 --> 00:00:39.420 
14th places where we start but I think

00:00:39.420 --> 00:00:41.299 
14th places where we start but I think
we<00:00:39.719> can<00:00:39.840> get<00:00:40.020> a<00:00:40.079> good<00:00:40.290> start<00:00:40.590> here<00:00:40.680> today<00:00:41.129> and

00:00:41.299 --> 00:00:41.309 
we can get a good start here today and

00:00:41.309 --> 00:00:43.100 
we can get a good start here today and
possibly<00:00:41.940> get<00:00:42.149> up<00:00:42.270> the<00:00:42.390> order<00:00:42.600> straightaway

00:00:43.100 --> 00:00:43.110 
possibly get up the order straightaway

00:00:43.110 --> 00:00:45.380 
possibly get up the order straightaway
but<00:00:43.170> there's<00:00:43.410> a<00:00:43.469> tire<00:00:44.070> wheel<00:00:44.610> flying<00:00:45.090> in<00:00:45.300> the

00:00:45.380 --> 00:00:45.390 
but there's a tire wheel flying in the

00:00:45.390 --> 00:00:47.590 
but there's a tire wheel flying in the
air<00:00:45.510> I<00:00:45.539> think<00:00:45.660> that's<00:00:45.870> Fernando<00:00:46.440> Alonso<00:00:46.980> has

00:00:47.590 --> 00:00:47.600 
air I think that's Fernando Alonso has

00:00:47.600 --> 00:00:50.389 
air I think that's Fernando Alonso has
actually<00:00:48.600> crashed<00:00:49.379> into<00:00:49.559> his<00:00:49.739> teammate<00:00:49.980> maybe

00:00:50.389 --> 00:00:50.399 
actually crashed into his teammate maybe

00:00:50.399 --> 00:00:51.709 
actually crashed into his teammate maybe
I<00:00:50.550> think<00:00:50.730> it<00:00:50.850> was<00:00:50.969> I<00:00:51.120> don't<00:00:51.239> know<00:00:51.329> even<00:00:51.600> know

00:00:51.709 --> 00:00:51.719 
I think it was I don't know even know

00:00:51.719 --> 00:00:53.900 
I think it was I don't know even know
but<00:00:51.960> he's<00:00:52.050> lost<00:00:52.260> a<00:00:52.440> lot<00:00:52.590> of<00:00:52.620> time<00:00:52.920> I<00:00:53.219> think<00:00:53.460> he's

00:00:53.900 --> 00:00:53.910 
but he's lost a lot of time I think he's

00:00:53.910 --> 00:00:55.790 
but he's lost a lot of time I think he's
probably<00:00:54.090> out<00:00:54.360> of<00:00:54.390> the<00:00:54.510> race<00:00:54.750> now<00:00:55.079> and<00:00:55.289> don't

00:00:55.790 --> 00:00:55.800 
probably out of the race now and don't

00:00:55.800 --> 00:00:57.080 
probably out of the race now and don't
think<00:00:56.039> you<00:00:56.219> had<00:00:56.370> to<00:00:56.489> get<00:00:56.610> that<00:00:56.730> back<00:00:56.879> to<00:00:57.000> the

00:00:57.080 --> 00:00:57.090 
think you had to get that back to the

00:00:57.090 --> 00:00:58.160 
think you had to get that back to the
pit<00:00:57.270> lane<00:00:57.300> because<00:00:57.629> you're<00:00:57.750> on<00:00:57.809> the<00:00:57.840> mini-map

00:00:58.160 --> 00:00:58.170 
pit lane because you're on the mini-map

00:00:58.170 --> 00:01:00.380 
pit lane because you're on the mini-map
yeah<00:00:58.469> Alonso<00:00:59.039> has<00:00:59.219> retired<00:00:59.609> from<00:00:59.910> this<00:01:00.120> race

00:01:00.380 --> 00:01:00.390 
yeah Alonso has retired from this race

00:01:00.390 --> 00:01:02.869 
yeah Alonso has retired from this race
here<00:01:00.629> today<00:01:01.100> not<00:01:02.100> good<00:01:02.399> for<00:01:02.550> him<00:01:02.699> whatsoever

00:01:02.869 --> 00:01:02.879 
here today not good for him whatsoever

00:01:02.879 --> 00:01:04.549 
here today not good for him whatsoever
and<00:01:03.300> we've<00:01:03.390> got<00:01:03.600> past<00:01:03.840> a<00:01:03.930> couple<00:01:04.140> of<00:01:04.229> people<00:01:04.379> up

00:01:49.079 --> 00:01:51.649 
it's truly the next person our list but
a<00:01:49.110> card<00:01:49.380> is<00:01:49.470> for<00:01:49.619> so<00:01:49.860> much<00:01:50.040> nicer<00:01:50.520> and<00:01:50.790> as<00:01:51.540> we

00:01:51.649 --> 00:01:51.659 
a card is for so much nicer and as we

00:01:51.659 --> 00:01:53.480

great<00:02:00.030> here<00:02:00.329> up<00:02:00.570> into<00:02:00.960> sixth<00:02:01.229> place<00:02:01.259> I<00:02:01.710> think

00:02:01.910 --> 00:02:01.920 
great here up into sixth place I think

00:02:01.920 --> 00:02:03.800 
great here up into sixth place I think
even<00:02:02.250> finishing<00:02:02.640> secret<00:02:03.119> that's<00:02:03.270> probably

00:02:03.800 --> 00:02:03.810 
even finishing secret that's probably

00:02:03.810 --> 00:02:05.480 
even finishing secret that's probably
our<00:02:04.020> best<00:02:04.170> result<00:02:04.590> I<00:02:04.680> think<00:02:04.920> I<00:02:05.159> think<00:02:05.430> we

00:02:05.480 --> 00:02:05.490 
our best result I think I think we

00:02:05.490 --> 00:02:06.889 
our best result I think I think we
finished<00:02:05.759> seventh<00:02:06.090> so<00:02:06.270> I<00:02:06.299> don't<00:02:06.630> even<00:02:06.689> know

00:02:06.889 --> 00:02:06.899 
finished seventh so I don't even know

00:02:06.899 --> 00:02:08.210 
finished seventh so I don't even know
you<00:02:07.110> guys<00:02:07.140> who<00:02:07.469> let<00:02:07.619> me<00:02:07.649> know<00:02:07.829> but<00:02:07.950> I<00:02:08.009> think

00:02:08.210 --> 00:02:08.220 
you guys who let me know but I think

00:02:08.220 --> 00:02:10.609 
you guys who let me know but I think
sixth<00:02:08.580> would<00:02:08.789> be<00:02:08.940> at<00:02:09.450> least<00:02:09.599> equal<00:02:10.050> our<00:02:10.379> best

00:02:10.609 --> 00:02:10.619 
sixth would be at least equal our best

00:02:10.619 --> 00:02:12.340 
sixth would be at least equal our best

00:02:36.430 --> 00:02:36.440 
the rest of the season I think the

00:02:36.440 --> 00:02:38.230 
the rest of the season I think the
contract<00:02:36.890> ends<00:02:37.160> at<00:02:37.460> the<00:02:37.550> end<00:02:37.580> of<00:02:37.820> this<00:02:37.940> season

contract ends at the end of this season
it<00:02:39.020> doesn't<00:02:39.260> go<00:02:39.350> a<00:02:39.380> halfway<00:02:39.890> through<00:02:40.070> the<00:02:40.190> next

00:02:40.360 --> 00:02:40.370 
it doesn't go a halfway through the next

00:02:40.370 --> 00:02:42.130 
it doesn't go a halfway through the next
season<00:02:40.670> which<00:02:40.790> is<00:02:40.910> actually<00:02:41.150> quite<00:02:41.360> good<00:02:41.600> but

00:02:42.130 --> 00:02:42.140 
season which is actually quite good but

00:02:42.140 --> 00:02:43.540 
season which is actually quite good but
you<00:02:42.200> can<00:02:42.320> see<00:02:42.500> here<00:02:42.740> we<00:02:42.860> have<00:02:42.890> a<00:02:43.220> slight

00:02:43.540 --> 00:02:43.550 
you can see here we have a slight

00:02:43.550 --> 00:02:45.820 
you can see here we have a slight
mistake<00:02:43.910> we<00:02:44.120> have<00:02:44.300> a<00:02:44.540> six<00:02:45.440> second<00:02:45.800> penalty

00:02:45.820 --> 00:02:45.830 
mistake we have a six second penalty

00:02:45.830 --> 00:02:47.650 
mistake we have a six second penalty
which<00:02:46.310> really<00:02:46.550> annoyed<00:02:46.910> me<00:02:46.940> that<00:02:47.090> well<00:02:47.420> out

00:02:47.650 --> 00:02:47.660 
which really annoyed me that well out

00:02:47.660 --> 00:02:49.210 
which really annoyed me that well out
having<00:02:47.930> a<00:02:48.020> great<00:02:48.170> race<00:02:48.470> why<00:02:48.800> did<00:02:48.950> the<00:02:49.040> guns

00:02:49.210 --> 00:02:49.220 
having a great race why did the guns

00:02:49.220 --> 00:02:51.310 
having a great race why did the guns
spoil<00:02:49.580> if<00:02:49.730> me<00:02:49.880> that<00:02:50.060> game<00:02:50.360> that<00:02:50.750> is<00:02:50.840> not<00:02:51.050> worthy

00:02:51.310 --> 00:02:51.320 
spoil if me that game that is not worthy

00:02:51.320 --> 00:02:53.080 
spoil if me that game that is not worthy
of<00:02:51.500> a<00:02:51.620> six<00:02:51.860> second<00:02:52.190> penalty<00:02:52.220> maybe<00:02:52.730> a<00:02:52.850> two

00:02:53.080 --> 00:02:53.090 
of a six second penalty maybe a two

00:02:53.090 --> 00:02:55.960 
of a six second penalty maybe a two
second<00:02:53.510> penalty<00:02:53.630> enter<00:02:54.140> no<00:02:54.260> but<00:02:54.730> it's<00:02:55.730> like<00:02:55.880> if

00:02:55.960 --> 00:02:55.970 
second penalty enter no but it's like if

00:02:55.970 --> 00:02:57.970 
second penalty enter no but it's like if
you<00:02:56.060> shortcut<00:02:56.540> the<00:02:56.720> first<00:02:56.990> turn<00:02:57.200> at<00:02:57.350> Monza<00:02:57.800> and

00:02:57.970 --> 00:02:57.980 
you shortcut the first turn at Monza and

00:02:57.980 --> 00:02:59.770 
you shortcut the first turn at Monza and
gain<00:02:58.550> some<00:02:58.820> positions<00:02:59.240> there<00:02:59.390> that's<00:02:59.600> for

00:02:59.770 --> 00:02:59.780 
gain some positions there that's for

00:02:59.780 --> 00:03:01.390 
gain some positions there that's for
like<00:02:59.960> a<00:02:59.990> six<00:03:00.380> or<00:03:00.560> whatever<00:03:00.710> a<00:03:00.890> second<00:03:01.250> penalty

00:03:01.390 --> 00:03:01.400 
like a six or whatever a second penalty

00:03:01.400 --> 00:03:03.970 
like a six or whatever a second penalty
but<00:03:01.820> no<00:03:02.540> that<00:03:02.810> ruled<00:03:03.290> I<00:03:03.410> think<00:03:03.590> gained<00:03:03.740> many

00:03:03.970 --> 00:03:03.980 
but no that ruled I think gained many

00:03:03.980 --> 00:03:06.400 
but no that ruled I think gained many

00:04:11.320 --> 00:04:11.330 
had to wait so it probably ended up

00:04:11.330 --> 00:04:12.730 
had to wait so it probably ended up
being<00:04:11.510> about<00:04:11.570> a<00:04:11.660> ten-second<00:04:12.290> stop<00:04:12.530> there

in 2007 we make the move and we're into
10th<00:04:52.900> place<00:04:53.050> here<00:04:53.710> and<00:04:53.949> what's<00:04:54.789> the<00:04:54.969> position

00:04:55.110 --> 00:04:55.120 
10th place here and what's the position

00:04:55.120 --> 00:04:56.879 
10th place here and what's the position
gonna<00:04:55.479> be<00:04:55.659> on<00:04:55.840> out<00:04:56.139> the<00:04:56.259> pit<00:04:56.439> lane<00:04:56.560> here<00:04:56.770> it's

gonna be on out the pit lane here it's

00:04:56.889 --> 00:04:59.879 
gonna be on out the pit lane here it's
gonna<00:04:57.009> be<00:04:57.219> very<00:04:57.580> very<00:04:58.389> close<00:04:58.810> between<00:04:59.110> us<00:04:59.529> and

00:04:59.879 --> 00:04:59.889 
gonna be very very close between us and

00:04:59.889 --> 00:05:03.749 
gonna be very very close between us and
I<00:05:00.099> think<00:05:00.449> Montoya<00:05:01.449> I<00:05:01.900> notice<00:05:02.740> there's<00:05:03.039> a<00:05:03.189> var

00:05:03.749 --> 00:05:03.759 
I think Montoya I notice there's a var

00:05:03.759 --> 00:05:05.939 
I think Montoya I notice there's a var
too<00:05:04.270> sure<00:05:04.449> that<00:05:04.479> is<00:05:04.779> well<00:05:05.169> we<00:05:05.259> nearly<00:05:05.469> hit<00:05:05.770> one

00:05:05.939 --> 00:05:05.949 
too sure that is well we nearly hit one

00:05:05.949 --> 00:05:07.379 
too sure that is well we nearly hit one
tour<00:05:06.189> I<00:05:06.310> think<00:05:06.550> that's<00:05:06.699> coming<00:05:06.939> up<00:05:07.090> the<00:05:07.210> pit

00:05:07.379 --> 00:05:07.389 
tour I think that's coming up the pit

00:05:07.389 --> 00:05:09.689 
tour I think that's coming up the pit
lane<00:05:07.539> here<00:05:07.930> that<00:05:08.289> was<00:05:08.409> Barack<00:05:08.740> hello<00:05:09.069> the<00:05:09.250> VAR

00:05:09.689 --> 00:05:09.699 
lane here that was Barack hello the VAR

00:05:09.699 --> 00:05:12.149 
lane here that was Barack hello the VAR
but<00:05:09.849> we<00:05:09.939> get<00:05:10.120> past<00:05:10.389> Montoya<00:05:10.840> and<00:05:11.139> into<00:05:11.889> third

00:05:12.149 --> 00:05:12.159 
but we get past Montoya and into third

00:05:12.159 --> 00:05:15.510 
but we get past Montoya and into third
place<00:05:12.400> and<00:05:12.789> speed<00:05:13.689> Scott<00:05:14.259> speed<00:05:14.590> is<00:05:15.039> currently

00:05:15.510 --> 00:05:15.520 
place and speed Scott speed is currently

00:05:15.520 --> 00:05:17.070 
place and speed Scott speed is currently
leading<00:05:15.879> this<00:05:16.150> race<00:05:16.479> I<00:05:16.779> bet<00:05:16.960> you're<00:05:17.050> thinking

00:05:17.070 --> 00:05:17.080 
leading this race I bet you're thinking

00:05:17.080 --> 00:05:19.230 
leading this race I bet you're thinking
what<00:05:17.800> what<00:05:18.250> on<00:05:18.400> earth's<00:05:18.580> happened<00:05:18.699> in<00:05:19.029> there

00:05:19.230 --> 00:05:19.240 
what what on earth's happened in there

00:05:19.240 --> 00:05:21.930 
what what on earth's happened in there
but<00:05:19.539> basically<00:05:20.229> he<00:05:20.860> isn't<00:05:21.129> stopped<00:05:21.430> yet<00:05:21.699> so

00:05:21.930 --> 00:05:21.940 
but basically he isn't stopped yet so

00:05:21.940 --> 00:05:23.969 
but basically he isn't stopped yet so
that's<00:05:22.120> all<00:05:22.300> cleared<00:05:22.930> up<00:05:23.139> I<00:05:23.349> assume<00:05:23.680> but<00:05:23.830> we

00:05:23.969 --> 00:05:23.979 
that's all cleared up I assume but we

00:05:23.979 --> 00:05:25.950 
that's all cleared up I assume but we
got<00:05:24.129> a<00:05:24.159> bit<00:05:24.310> too<00:05:24.490> late<00:05:25.060> into<00:05:25.360> the<00:05:25.449> cooler<00:05:25.690> there

00:05:25.950 --> 00:05:25.960 
got a bit too late into the cooler there

00:05:25.960 --> 00:05:29.309 
got a bit too late into the cooler there
Montoya<00:05:26.409> gets<00:05:26.740> back<00:05:27.039> past<00:05:27.460> us<00:05:27.759> there<00:05:28.199> so<00:05:29.199> this

00:05:29.309 --> 00:05:29.319 
Montoya gets back past us there so this

00:05:29.319 --> 00:05:31.769 
Montoya gets back past us there so this
is<00:05:29.469> technically<00:05:29.889> a<00:05:30.009> battle<00:05:30.460> for<00:05:30.819> second<00:05:31.659> place

00:05:31.769 --> 00:05:31.779 
is technically a battle for second place

00:05:31.779 --> 00:05:34.019 
is technically a battle for second place
here<00:05:32.229> master<00:05:32.710> has<00:05:32.979> actually<00:05:33.490> stopped<00:05:33.789> I<00:05:33.909> know

00:05:34.019 --> 00:05:34.029 
here master has actually stopped I know

00:05:34.029 --> 00:05:35.879 
here master has actually stopped I know
we're<00:05:34.300> thinking<00:05:34.419> how<00:05:34.870> is<00:05:34.930> he<00:05:35.080> so<00:05:35.199> far<00:05:35.500> ahead<00:05:35.589> I

00:05:35.879 --> 00:05:35.889 
we're thinking how is he so far ahead I

00:05:35.889 --> 00:05:36.740 
we're thinking how is he so far ahead I
don't<00:05:35.949> know<00:05:36.219> either

00:05:36.740 --> 00:05:36.750 
don't know either

00:05:36.750 --> 00:05:39.420 
don't know either
but<00:05:37.750> yeah<00:05:37.960> this<00:05:38.080> is<00:05:38.199> about<00:05:38.409> second<00:05:38.949> place<00:05:39.129> here

00:05:39.420 --> 00:05:39.430 
but yeah this is about second place here

00:05:39.430 --> 00:05:41.700 
but yeah this is about second place here
and<00:05:39.580> once<00:05:40.479> where<00:05:40.779> you'd<00:05:41.139> expect

00:05:41.700 --> 00:05:41.710 
and once where you'd expect

00:05:41.710 --> 00:05:43.649 
and once where you'd expect
Montoya<00:05:42.310> to<00:05:42.490> be<00:05:42.610> way<00:05:42.819> ahead<00:05:42.849> of<00:05:43.120> the<00:05:43.270> Red<00:05:43.419> Bulls

00:05:43.649 --> 00:05:43.659 
Montoya to be way ahead of the Red Bulls

00:05:43.659 --> 00:05:45.899

cross<00:06:19.029> here<00:06:19.270> I'm<00:06:19.659> really<00:06:20.080> really<00:06:20.469> trying<00:06:20.770> here

00:06:21.240 --> 00:06:21.250 
cross here I'm really really trying here

00:06:21.250 --> 00:06:22.950 
cross here I'm really really trying here
and<00:06:21.490> I<00:06:21.879> trying<00:06:22.120> to<00:06:22.150> get<00:06:22.300> every<00:06:22.539> tenth<00:06:22.779> of<00:06:22.900> a

00:06:24.659 --> 00:06:24.669 
second out of the car I think I just

00:06:24.669 --> 00:06:25.980 
second out of the car I think I just
broke<00:06:24.759> a<00:06:24.849> little<00:06:25.000> bit<00:06:25.210> late<00:06:25.389> into<00:06:25.569> that<00:06:25.689> term

00:06:25.980 --> 00:06:25.990 
broke a little bit late into that term

00:06:25.990 --> 00:06:27.930 
broke a little bit late into that term

and we've gone to the last lap of the

00:06:27.940 --> 00:06:30.420 
and we've gone to the last lap of the
race<00:06:27.969> you<00:06:28.300> can<00:06:28.449> see<00:06:28.719> through<00:06:29.440> my<00:06:29.469> five<00:06:29.949> and<00:06:30.219> six

00:06:48.049 --> 00:06:48.059 
sectors there but we managed to get that

00:06:48.059 --> 00:06:49.790 
sectors there but we managed to get that
turn<00:06:48.300> right<00:06:48.569> which<00:06:48.749> is<00:06:48.869> the<00:06:48.990> most<00:06:49.169> important

00:06:49.790 --> 00:06:49.800 
turn right which is the most important

00:06:49.800 --> 00:06:52.639 
turn right which is the most important

00:06:55.100 --> 00:06:55.110 
away a bit but let's be honest we

00:06:55.110 --> 00:06:56.600 
away a bit but let's be honest we
probably<00:06:55.349> were<00:06:55.589> gonna<00:06:55.830> beat<00:06:56.009> one<00:06:56.159> tour<00:06:56.399> in

00:06:56.600 --> 00:06:56.610 
probably were gonna beat one tour in

00:06:56.610 --> 00:06:59.029 
probably were gonna beat one tour in
this<00:06:56.789> race<00:06:57.029> but<00:06:57.330> third<00:06:57.839> place<00:06:57.869> who<00:06:58.770> would<00:06:58.919> have

00:06:59.029 --> 00:06:59.039 
this race but third place who would have

00:06:59.039 --> 00:07:01.760 
this race but third place who would have
expected<00:06:59.129> it<00:06:59.699> we<00:06:59.789> pull<00:06:59.999> that<00:07:00.119> big<00:07:00.449> biggest<00:07:01.319> gap

00:07:01.760 --> 00:07:01.770 
expected it we pull that big biggest gap

00:07:01.770 --> 00:07:03.379 
expected it we pull that big biggest gap
