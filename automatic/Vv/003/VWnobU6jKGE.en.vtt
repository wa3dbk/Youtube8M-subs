00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.540
 two characters that already gave a lot of 

00:00:01.979 --> 00:00:05.790
 what to talk about in this saga of versus and 

00:00:03.540 --> 00:00:08.099
 cap or bartolomé okuma the genius 

00:00:05.790 --> 00:00:10.349
 ninja or the perfect weapon only one will be able 

00:00:08.099 --> 00:00:12.090
 advance to the final phase to decide what 

00:00:10.349 --> 00:00:13.590
 more objectively possible to the winner 

00:00:12.090 --> 00:00:15.690
 we will proceed to analyze both 

00:00:13.590 --> 00:00:17.820
 characters let's start with hitachi ja 

00:00:15.690 --> 00:00:19.439
 hitachi is a very skilled ninja and 

00:00:17.820 --> 00:00:21.810
 technician in combat the body body 

00:00:19.439 --> 00:00:23.490
 still not being his specialty he 

00:00:21.810 --> 00:00:25.289
 he became very feared because he is 

00:00:23.490 --> 00:00:26.880
 possessor of sharing and visual power 

00:00:25.289 --> 00:00:29.010
 that allows you to see the movements of your 

00:00:26.880 --> 00:00:30.599
 rival precociously and tiba in addition to 

00:00:29.010 --> 00:00:31.859
 that allows you to be able to use very 

00:00:30.599 --> 00:00:34.200
 powerful among which we can 

00:00:31.859 --> 00:00:35.880
 mention your script and techniques that attacks 

00:00:34.200 --> 00:00:37.380
 the central nervous system of the enemy 

00:00:35.880 --> 00:00:39.420
 through the manipulation of their 

00:00:37.380 --> 00:00:40.770
 chakra channels taking it like that to a 

00:00:39.420 --> 00:00:42.450
 world of illusion within its own 

00:00:40.770 --> 00:00:44.070
 mind in which hitachi is capable of 

00:00:42.450 --> 00:00:46.890
 manipulate your perception of time and 

00:00:44.070 --> 00:00:48.210
 amaterasu space this technique allows 

00:00:46.890 --> 00:00:50.010
 create black fire where hitachi 

00:00:48.210 --> 00:00:51.270
 focus your eyes these flames do not 

00:00:50.010 --> 00:00:53.399
 can extinguish by means 

00:00:51.270 --> 00:00:55.770
 conventional and by definition can 

00:00:53.399 --> 00:00:57.270
 consume it all corrected with this 

00:00:55.770 --> 00:00:59.309
 hitachi technique creates a spirit 

00:00:57.270 --> 00:01:03.000
 gigantic that protects them by providing 

00:00:59.309 --> 00:01:05.100
 an excellent Toluca sword defense this 

00:01:03.000 --> 00:01:07.150
 gun strength susana vitachi with her 

00:01:05.100 --> 00:01:09.370
 can seal their opponents 

00:01:07.150 --> 00:01:11.470
 However, not only can you seal 

00:01:09.370 --> 00:01:13.810
 mind but also objects and bodies 

00:01:11.470 --> 00:01:16.000
 human shield this shield is already in the 

00:01:13.810 --> 00:01:18.400
 definitive defense works reflecting 

00:01:16.000 --> 00:01:20.890
 the rival attack like a mirror so 

00:01:18.400 --> 00:01:22.480
 that neutralizes it already take inhuman bed 

00:01:20.890 --> 00:01:24.160
 is that youtube consists of a kind 

00:01:22.480 --> 00:01:25.930
 of jewel of chacras created from 

00:01:24.160 --> 00:01:27.580
 the arms of the cease not this one has for 

00:01:25.930 --> 00:01:29.770
 features that is thrown so 

00:01:27.580 --> 00:01:31.360
 very similar to a jury like hitachi 

00:01:29.770 --> 00:01:32.980
 He has also shown to manage techniques 

00:01:31.360 --> 00:01:34.840
 of style games plus techniques of 

00:01:32.980 --> 00:01:36.460
 water as is the case with the explosive clone 

00:01:34.840 --> 00:01:38.170
 that are against Caracas and finally 

00:01:36.460 --> 00:01:40.119
 In addition to all the above mentioned and you 

00:01:38.170 --> 00:01:41.830
 has shown great intellect and that is 

00:01:40.119 --> 00:01:43.630
 the quality that has earned him to be able 

00:01:41.830 --> 00:01:45.520
 stay in the elite of the ninja world 

00:01:43.630 --> 00:01:47.470
 now let's look at their weaknesses in 

00:01:45.520 --> 00:01:49.150
 first place your health is affected by 

00:01:47.470 --> 00:01:51.369
 your own techniques the more you 

00:01:49.150 --> 00:01:52.990
 use more increases your blindness in addition to 

00:01:51.369 --> 00:01:54.850
 they need in particular is capable of 

00:01:52.990 --> 00:01:56.440
 accelerate your death this if you use 

00:01:54.850 --> 00:01:57.880
 prolonged way so if not 

00:01:56.440 --> 00:01:59.860
 find a quick way to earn the 

00:01:57.880 --> 00:02:01.990
 combat can mean its end in 

00:01:59.860 --> 00:02:04.090
 definitive a long fight means the 

00:02:01.990 --> 00:02:05.740
 death of akatsuki ya jingan 

00:02:04.090 --> 00:02:07.720
 anticipates its rivals by watching the flow of 

00:02:05.740 --> 00:02:09.250
 chakra of these thing that would not work 

00:02:07.720 --> 00:02:11.230
 in one piece characters because of 

00:02:09.250 --> 00:02:13.300
 they lack this power on your whose 

00:02:11.230 --> 00:02:13.990
 mini no youtube can be used 

00:02:13.300 --> 00:02:16.780
 In person 

00:02:13.990 --> 00:02:18.280
 because they do not have chakras has 

00:02:16.780 --> 00:02:20.800
 proved that matter can not be 

00:02:18.280 --> 00:02:22.780
 evaded and also repelled the susano no 

00:02:20.800 --> 00:02:24.160
 offers full protection the cachis already 

00:02:22.780 --> 00:02:25.750
 let light and sound pass 

00:02:24.160 --> 00:02:28.180
 allowing attacks of this type 

00:02:25.750 --> 00:02:29.680
 may affect them another weak point are 

00:02:28.180 --> 00:02:31.090
 or hitachi is that he never reached 

00:02:29.680 --> 00:02:33.100
 evolve to its perfect shape 

00:02:31.090 --> 00:02:35.050
 stabilized and because neither is 

00:02:33.100 --> 00:02:36.730
 He showed his whole body in this verse 

00:02:35.050 --> 00:02:38.770
 may be used only the medium 

00:02:36.730 --> 00:02:41.200
 good body now let's analyze 

00:02:38.770 --> 00:02:42.670
 kuma this walkie touch character and ya 

00:02:41.200 --> 00:02:44.350
 had had his presentation in verses 

00:02:42.670 --> 00:02:46.090
 past so you already have an idea of 

00:02:44.350 --> 00:02:48.130
 your skills but if there are people 

00:02:46.090 --> 00:02:49.810
 new to the channel who do not know him yet 

00:02:48.130 --> 00:02:51.820
 then I describe it to you again 

00:02:49.810 --> 00:02:53.800
 bartolomé okuma was a very feared pirate 

00:02:51.820 --> 00:02:55.450
 and for its cruelty was nicknamed the tyrant 

00:02:53.800 --> 00:02:57.910
 once it was for revolutionary army 

00:02:55.450 --> 00:02:59.740
 which aims to overthrow the 

00:02:57.910 --> 00:03:01.780
 world government but later by 

00:02:59.740 --> 00:03:03.400
 unknown reasons accept a deal with 

00:03:01.780 --> 00:03:05.410
 this one to be converted in a way 

00:03:03.400 --> 00:03:06.910
 progressive on a machine which would be 

00:03:05.410 --> 00:03:08.800
 considered the perfect weapon 

00:03:06.910 --> 00:03:10.600
 currently kuma completed its phase of 

00:03:08.800 --> 00:03:12.520
 modifications so it no longer owns 

00:03:10.600 --> 00:03:14.230
 consciousness and is limited to meet the foot 

00:03:12.520 --> 00:03:15.010
 of the letter the objectives that his 

00:03:14.230 --> 00:03:16.270
 higher 

00:03:15.010 --> 00:03:18.490
 Kuma is undoubtedly one of the characters 

00:03:16.270 --> 00:03:20.620
 most powerful seen in the series and this 

00:03:18.490 --> 00:03:22.840
 he owes it to the following skills 

00:03:20.620 --> 00:03:25.510
 place can be said that physically it is 

00:03:22.840 --> 00:03:27.250
 a pro with a height of 6 meters and 80 

00:03:25.510 --> 00:03:29.110
 centimeters and a weight of more than one 

00:03:27.250 --> 00:03:31.659
 ton fight with him is a 

00:03:29.110 --> 00:03:33.310
 nightmare is almost a suicide is 

00:03:31.659 --> 00:03:34.840
 made of a material that in many 

00:03:33.310 --> 00:03:36.970
 times has proven to be harder than 

00:03:34.840 --> 00:03:38.560
 the steel since attacks that normally 

00:03:36.970 --> 00:03:40.269
 slice them as butter 

00:03:38.560 --> 00:03:41.590
 find your body have not been 

00:03:40.269 --> 00:03:43.690
 able to do more than small 

00:03:41.590 --> 00:03:45.610
 scratches now let's see your skills 

00:03:43.690 --> 00:03:47.079
 special as they possess the powers of the 

00:03:45.610 --> 00:03:49.000
 mission and that I do not fruit that what 

00:03:47.079 --> 00:03:50.349
 turned into a man repellent is 

00:03:49.000 --> 00:03:52.599
 say that you have the power to 

00:03:50.349 --> 00:03:54.340
 repel everything and that everything covers 

00:03:52.599 --> 00:03:56.079
 any kind of attack objects 

00:03:54.340 --> 00:03:58.540
 even intangible things like damage 

00:03:56.079 --> 00:04:00.190
 physical or psychological having also the 

00:03:58.540 --> 00:04:02.049
 possibility of transferring it from a 

00:04:00.190 --> 00:04:03.790
 person to another thanks to his powers of 

00:04:02.049 --> 00:04:05.890
 repulsion can make attacks 

00:04:03.790 --> 00:04:07.540
 based on air like super impact 

00:04:05.890 --> 00:04:09.370
 with which it displaces air bubbles 

00:04:07.540 --> 00:04:10.390
 that shoot out like projectiles 

00:04:09.370 --> 00:04:12.280
 towards his rivals 

00:04:10.390 --> 00:04:14.049
 these attacks travel at light speed and 

00:04:12.280 --> 00:04:15.909
 are able to go through the goal of 

00:04:14.049 --> 00:04:17.380
 side by side affecting everything in a chain 

00:04:15.909 --> 00:04:18.760
 that this pirate is behind them 

00:04:17.380 --> 00:04:20.350
 It is also capable of putting out 

00:04:18.760 --> 00:04:22.210
 fight your rivals by sending them to 

00:04:20.350 --> 00:04:23.800
 blow in one fell swoop the 

00:04:22.210 --> 00:04:25.539
 people who fall victim to it 

00:04:23.800 --> 00:04:27.070
 it can happen even up to three days 

00:04:25.539 --> 00:04:28.870
 traveling through the heavens 

00:04:27.070 --> 00:04:30.340
 remove because apparently kuma 

00:04:28.870 --> 00:04:32.680
 puts a thick layer of air that 

00:04:30.340 --> 00:04:34.750
 it works as a prison and not only that already 

00:04:32.680 --> 00:04:36.580
 that this pirate is able to decide the 

00:04:34.750 --> 00:04:38.590
 part of the world where they will fall to 

00:04:36.580 --> 00:04:40.030
 use this technique the size of the rival does not 

00:04:38.590 --> 00:04:41.710
 it's a problem because he was also seen 

00:04:40.030 --> 00:04:43.090
 use it with software which is 

00:04:41.710 --> 00:04:45.370
 I found myself turned into a monster 

00:04:43.090 --> 00:04:47.320
 giant in terms of destructive level the 

00:04:45.370 --> 00:04:49.360
 most powerful attack he has as he 

00:04:47.320 --> 00:04:50.950
 called a sexshop for its realization 

00:04:49.360 --> 00:04:52.450
 compresses a lot of air in 

00:04:50.950 --> 00:04:54.640
 the palms of his hands for then 

00:04:52.450 --> 00:04:56.290
 release it at once this generates a 

00:04:54.640 --> 00:04:58.180
 impact similar to a gigantic bomb 

00:04:56.290 --> 00:04:59.730
 of great power that encompasses proportions of 

00:04:58.180 --> 00:05:02.140
 land similar to an entire island 

00:04:59.730 --> 00:05:03.940
 this bucay chassis has a laser 

00:05:02.140 --> 00:05:05.680
 installed on your body which launches 

00:05:03.940 --> 00:05:07.090
 from his mouth this is a version 

00:05:05.680 --> 00:05:08.950
 technology of the light rays of the 

00:05:07.090 --> 00:05:11.080
 admiral perhaps who are capable 

00:05:08.950 --> 00:05:13.030
 removing easily in addition to the 

00:05:11.080 --> 00:05:14.320
 impact generate massive explosions if 

00:05:13.030 --> 00:05:15.640
 well all the skills before 

00:05:14.320 --> 00:05:17.710
 mentioned do as a rival 

00:05:15.640 --> 00:05:19.360
 fearsome for me the best effort in 'the 

00:05:17.710 --> 00:05:21.250
 is the capacity you have for 

00:05:19.360 --> 00:05:23.470
 transported instantaneously from 

00:05:21.250 --> 00:05:25.150
 one place to another thanks to this is capable 

00:05:23.470 --> 00:05:26.980
 to get behind the rivals before 

00:05:25.150 --> 00:05:28.600
 that these can not even blink and 

00:05:26.980 --> 00:05:30.400
 use it at the same time also to evade 

00:05:28.600 --> 00:05:31.810
 attacks done with it was able to 

00:05:30.400 --> 00:05:33.129
 put on without being perceived in a way 

00:05:31.810 --> 00:05:35.649
 immediate 

00:05:33.129 --> 00:05:37.539
 and perhaps even this being a man 

00:05:35.649 --> 00:05:39.339
 of light so it is intuited that it exceeds 

00:05:37.539 --> 00:05:40.659
 its speed finally should mention 

00:05:39.339 --> 00:05:42.249
 that like some machine with a 

00:05:40.659 --> 00:05:44.469
 resistance beyond all human limits 

00:05:42.249 --> 00:05:46.239
 thing that showed when to protect the 

00:05:44.469 --> 00:05:48.459
 boat of the very equaled fought during 

00:05:46.239 --> 00:05:50.499
 two years against multiple enemies and still 

00:05:48.459 --> 00:05:52.419
 well he came out victorious guasu do not forget 

00:05:50.499 --> 00:05:54.669
 mention that as a user of all 

00:05:52.419 --> 00:05:56.619
 cumaná I can be weakened if 

00:05:54.669 --> 00:05:58.779
 covers most of your body with 

00:05:56.619 --> 00:06:00.729
 static water plus it's the weak 

00:05:58.779 --> 00:06:03.309
 against the cairo I know that and that the tachi no 

00:06:00.729 --> 00:06:05.679
 could confuse using his clones jan 

00:06:03.309 --> 00:06:07.719
 al funk lets finish blue water good 

00:06:05.679 --> 00:06:09.610
 friends the mutation opens if you think that 

00:06:07.719 --> 00:06:11.619
 the winner of this versus deserves to be it 

00:06:09.610 --> 00:06:14.080
 up if you write hitachi followed by your 

00:06:11.619 --> 00:06:16.059
 arguments as to how I would win if 

00:06:14.080 --> 00:06:17.860
 you think the winner deserves to be kuma 

00:06:16.059 --> 00:06:20.559
 Write more often of your 

00:06:17.860 --> 00:06:22.449
 arguments if you think the fight deserves 

00:06:20.559 --> 00:06:24.669
 finish in tie draw tie 

00:06:22.449 --> 00:06:26.289
 followed by your arguments the results 

00:06:24.669 --> 00:06:28.029
 will be presented in the next video of 

00:06:26.289 --> 00:06:30.159
 the saga before leaving I send a greeting 

00:06:28.029 --> 00:06:32.409
 to rubén darío pérez wardak who
