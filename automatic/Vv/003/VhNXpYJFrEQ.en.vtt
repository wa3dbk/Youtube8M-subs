Tower side a short Tower side and two
tower<00:00:43.559> ends<00:00:44.070> we'll<00:00:44.550> cut<00:00:44.699> all<00:00:44.879> four<00:00:45.120> of<00:00:45.179> those

00:00:45.290 --> 00:00:45.300 
tower ends we'll cut all four of those

00:00:45.300 --> 00:00:47.119 
tower ends we'll cut all four of those
pieces<00:00:45.600> to<00:00:45.840> width<00:00:46.019> on<00:00:46.109> the<00:00:46.199> table<00:00:46.500> saw<00:00:46.620> and<00:00:46.829> to

00:00:47.119 --> 00:00:47.129 
pieces to width on the table saw and to

have<00:00:50.010> a<00:00:50.039> window<00:00:50.550> and<00:00:50.789> a<00:00:51.000> notch<00:00:51.179> in<00:00:51.420> the<00:00:51.510> top<00:00:51.690> so

00:00:52.009 --> 00:00:52.019 
have a window and a notch in the top so

00:00:52.019 --> 00:00:53.540 
have a window and a notch in the top so
using<00:00:52.440> the<00:00:52.559> grid<00:00:52.800> trick<00:00:53.010> we<00:00:53.129> used<00:00:53.309> earlier

00:00:53.540 --> 00:00:53.550 
using the grid trick we used earlier

00:00:53.550 --> 00:00:55.549 
using the grid trick we used earlier
we'll<00:00:54.269> go<00:00:54.359> ahead<00:00:54.510> and<00:00:54.629> transfer<00:00:54.989> the<00:00:55.289> pattern

00:00:55.549 --> 00:00:55.559 
we'll go ahead and transfer the pattern

00:00:55.559 --> 00:00:56.779 
we'll go ahead and transfer the pattern
to<00:00:55.679> the<00:00:55.769> wood<00:00:55.949> and<00:00:56.129> cut<00:00:56.429> it<00:00:56.519> out<00:00:56.609> with<00:00:56.760> our

00:00:56.779 --> 00:00:56.789 
to the wood and cut it out with our

00:00:56.789 --> 00:00:59.270 
to the wood and cut it out with our
jigsaw<00:00:57.269> and<00:00:57.510> for<00:00:58.050> the<00:00:58.109> window<00:00:58.410> go<00:00:58.890> ahead<00:00:59.160> and

00:00:59.270 --> 00:00:59.280 
jigsaw and for the window go ahead and

00:00:59.280 --> 00:01:01.160 
jigsaw and for the window go ahead and
drill<00:00:59.429> a<00:00:59.460> hole<00:00:59.730> first<00:01:00.089> and<00:01:00.300> start<00:01:00.690> your<00:01:00.839> jigsaw

00:01:01.160 --> 00:01:01.170 
drill a hole first and start your jigsaw

00:01:01.170 --> 00:01:03.979 
drill a hole first and start your jigsaw
cut<00:01:01.440> there<00:01:02.179> right<00:01:03.179> now<00:01:03.390> I'm<00:01:03.690> going<00:01:03.839> to<00:01:03.899> go

00:01:03.979 --> 00:01:03.989 
cut there right now I'm going to go

00:01:03.989 --> 00:01:06.020 
cut there right now I'm going to go
ahead<00:01:04.110> and<00:01:04.379> drill<00:01:04.589> one<00:01:04.860> pocket<00:01:05.189> hole<00:01:05.519> in<00:01:05.759> each

00:01:06.020 --> 00:01:06.030 
ahead and drill one pocket hole in each

00:01:06.030 --> 00:01:07.460 
ahead and drill one pocket hole in each
tower<00:01:06.390> this<00:01:06.930> will<00:01:07.110> be<00:01:07.170> the<00:01:07.290> thing<00:01:07.409> that

00:01:07.460 --> 00:01:07.470 
tower this will be the thing that

00:01:07.470 --> 00:01:09.350 
tower this will be the thing that
enables<00:01:07.950> me<00:01:08.009> to<00:01:08.100> attach<00:01:08.549> the<00:01:08.790> castle<00:01:09.119> to<00:01:09.270> our

00:01:09.350 --> 00:01:09.360 
enables me to attach the castle to our

00:01:09.360 --> 00:01:11.810 
enables me to attach the castle to our
bookcase<00:01:09.720> once<00:01:10.409> I<00:01:10.530> do<00:01:10.590> that<00:01:10.680> it's<00:01:11.340> time<00:01:11.520> to<00:01:11.579> put

00:01:11.810 --> 00:01:11.820 
bookcase once I do that it's time to put

00:01:11.820 --> 00:01:13.520 
bookcase once I do that it's time to put
the<00:01:11.909> towers<00:01:12.210> together<00:01:12.360> I'll<00:01:12.900> take<00:01:13.079> all<00:01:13.290> four

00:01:13.520 --> 00:01:13.530 
the towers together I'll take all four

00:01:13.530 --> 00:01:15.380 
the towers together I'll take all four
pieces<00:01:13.710> for<00:01:14.130> each<00:01:14.280> tower<00:01:14.579> and<00:01:14.880> attach<00:01:15.180> them

00:01:15.380 --> 00:01:15.390 
pieces for each tower and attach them

00:01:15.390 --> 00:01:20.990 
pieces for each tower and attach them
together<00:01:15.509> with<00:01:15.810> glue<00:01:16.020> and<00:01:16.170> Brad's<00:01:20.000> four

00:01:21.000 --> 00:01:23.899 
together with glue and Brad's four
towers<00:01:21.290> four<00:01:22.290> corners<00:01:22.680> by<00:01:23.520> putting<00:01:23.820> our

00:01:23.899 --> 00:01:23.909 
towers four corners by putting our

00:01:23.909 --> 00:01:25.370 
towers four corners by putting our
towers<00:01:24.299> in<00:01:24.450> each<00:01:24.540> of<00:01:24.689> the<00:01:24.780> corners<00:01:25.079> and<00:01:25.229> then

00:01:25.370 --> 00:01:25.380 
towers in each of the corners and then

00:01:25.380 --> 00:01:26.929 
towers in each of the corners and then
measuring<00:01:25.770> the<00:01:25.860> distance<00:01:26.189> between<00:01:26.250> them<00:01:26.700> we

00:01:26.929 --> 00:01:26.939 
measuring the distance between them we

00:01:26.939 --> 00:01:28.899 
measuring the distance between them we
get<00:01:27.030> the<00:01:27.149> measurements<00:01:27.540> for<00:01:27.630> our<00:01:27.780> other<00:01:27.960> walls

00:01:28.899 --> 00:01:28.909 
get the measurements for our other walls

00:01:28.909 --> 00:01:31.459 
get the measurements for our other walls

well<00:01:48.539> now<00:01:49.140> we<00:01:49.619> need<00:01:49.740> some<00:01:49.890> more<00:01:49.920> pocket<00:01:50.369> holes

00:01:50.510 --> 00:01:50.520 
well now we need some more pocket holes

00:01:50.520 --> 00:01:52.580 
well now we need some more pocket holes
to<00:01:50.759> attach<00:01:50.880> the<00:01:51.270> front<00:01:51.450> back<00:01:51.810> and<00:01:51.840> side<00:01:52.289> walls

00:02:05.990 --> 00:02:06.000 
pocket hole screws so we need a way to

00:02:06.000 --> 00:02:07.940 
pocket hole screws so we need a way to
keep<00:02:06.240> our<00:02:06.420> drawbridge<00:02:06.899> closed<00:02:07.289> later<00:02:07.590> and<00:02:07.859> for

that we're going to attach a magnetic
catch<00:02:09.720> plate<00:02:10.080> so<00:02:10.709> we're<00:02:11.069> gonna<00:02:11.160> put<00:02:11.430> the<00:02:11.580> catch

00:02:11.750 --> 00:02:11.760 
catch plate so we're gonna put the catch

00:02:11.760 --> 00:02:13.759 
catch plate so we're gonna put the catch
plate<00:02:12.090> on<00:02:12.269> this<00:02:12.629> small<00:02:12.900> piece<00:02:13.140> go<00:02:13.590> ahead<00:02:13.620> and

00:02:13.759 --> 00:02:13.769 
plate on this small piece go ahead and

00:02:13.769 --> 00:02:14.150 
plate on this small piece go ahead and
cut<00:02:14.010> it

00:02:14.150 --> 00:02:14.160 
cut it

00:02:14.160 --> 00:02:16.000 
cut it
now<00:02:14.280> and<00:02:14.640> attach<00:02:14.970> it<00:02:15.120> with<00:02:15.150> glue<00:02:15.420> and<00:02:15.570> Brad's
