was very simple and it was very easy
everything<00:02:31.090> went<00:02:31.330> fine<00:02:31.390> without<00:02:32.200> a<00:02:32.410> hitch<00:02:32.970> ok

00:02:33.960 --> 00:02:33.970 
everything went fine without a hitch ok

00:02:33.970 --> 00:02:35.910 
everything went fine without a hitch ok
now<00:02:34.240> the<00:02:34.300> secondary<00:02:34.810> feature<00:02:34.960> of<00:02:35.350> this<00:02:35.560> weapon

00:02:35.910 --> 00:02:35.920 
now the secondary feature of this weapon

00:02:35.920 --> 00:02:37.860 
now the secondary feature of this weapon
system<00:02:36.400> is<00:02:36.580> also<00:02:36.910> what<00:02:37.300> happens<00:02:37.600> if<00:02:37.690> someone

00:02:37.860 --> 00:02:37.870 
system is also what happens if someone

00:02:37.870 --> 00:02:40.680 
system is also what happens if someone
tries<00:02:38.110> to<00:02:38.140> climb<00:02:38.440> from<00:02:38.680> underneath<00:02:38.950> this<00:02:39.850> cube

00:02:40.680 --> 00:02:40.690 
tries to climb from underneath this cube

00:02:40.690 --> 00:02:42.840 
tries to climb from underneath this cube
which<00:02:40.930> is<00:02:41.110> pretty<00:02:41.770> unlikely<00:02:42.010> because<00:02:42.520> it's

00:02:42.840 --> 00:02:42.850 
which is pretty unlikely because it's

00:02:42.850 --> 00:02:45.030 
which is pretty unlikely because it's
just<00:02:43.140> that's<00:02:44.140> really<00:02:44.350> far<00:02:44.620> as<00:02:44.770> you<00:02:44.890> can<00:02:44.980> see

00:02:45.030 --> 00:02:45.040 
just that's really far as you can see

00:02:45.040 --> 00:02:47.340 
just that's really far as you can see
see<00:02:45.730> how<00:02:45.790> tiny<00:02:46.060> the<00:02:46.270> squares<00:02:46.600> arms<00:02:46.900> it's<00:02:47.140> very

00:02:47.340 --> 00:02:47.350 
see how tiny the squares arms it's very

00:02:47.350 --> 00:02:50.220 
see how tiny the squares arms it's very
far<00:02:47.620> then<00:02:48.430> you<00:02:48.580> use<00:02:48.760> this<00:02:49.080> basically<00:02:50.080> what

00:02:50.220 --> 00:02:50.230 
far then you use this basically what

00:02:50.230 --> 00:02:51.960 
far then you use this basically what
this<00:02:50.320> does<00:02:50.560> is<00:02:50.680> send<00:02:50.830> the<00:02:50.920> signal<00:02:51.250> up<00:02:51.400> the

00:02:51.960 --> 00:02:51.970 
this does is send the signal up the

00:02:51.970 --> 00:02:55.560 
this does is send the signal up the
signal<00:02:52.300> shoots<00:02:52.480> up<00:02:52.660> bunch<00:02:53.110> of<00:02:53.230> wires<00:02:54.570> it

00:02:55.560 --> 00:02:55.570 
signal shoots up bunch of wires it

00:02:55.570 --> 00:02:57.360 
signal shoots up bunch of wires it
touches<00:02:55.810> a<00:02:55.960> bunch<00:02:56.200> of<00:02:56.290> it<00:02:56.590> sends<00:02:57.130> up<00:02:57.190> through

00:02:57.360 --> 00:02:57.370 
touches a bunch of it sends up through

00:02:57.370 --> 00:02:59.460 
touches a bunch of it sends up through
this<00:02:57.490> wire<00:02:58.270> touches<00:02:58.480> this<00:02:58.840> wire<00:02:59.050> activates

00:02:59.460 --> 00:02:59.470 
this wire touches this wire activates

00:02:59.470 --> 00:03:03.600 
this wire touches this wire activates
this<00:02:59.620> and<00:02:59.830> it<00:02:59.890> goals<00:03:00.070> and<00:03:00.370> spreads<00:03:00.940> out<00:03:01.150> and<00:03:02.610> as

00:03:03.600 --> 00:03:03.610 
this and it goals and spreads out and as

00:03:03.610 --> 00:03:05.610 
this and it goals and spreads out and as
you<00:03:03.820> can<00:03:03.970> see<00:03:04.000> it<00:03:04.510> will<00:03:04.720> go<00:03:04.870> into<00:03:05.140> a<00:03:05.320> certain

00:03:05.610 --> 00:03:05.620 
you can see it will go into a certain

00:03:05.620 --> 00:03:07.290 
you can see it will go into a certain
section<00:03:05.830> of<00:03:05.980> the<00:03:06.070> wall<00:03:06.220> into<00:03:06.730> this<00:03:06.970> obsidian

00:03:07.290 --> 00:03:07.300 
section of the wall into this obsidian

00:03:07.300 --> 00:03:09.870 
section of the wall into this obsidian
this<00:03:08.230> obsidian<00:03:08.590> cube<00:03:08.950> will<00:03:09.100> be<00:03:09.220> powered<00:03:09.610> this

00:03:09.870 --> 00:03:09.880 
this obsidian cube will be powered this

00:03:09.880 --> 00:03:12.510 
this obsidian cube will be powered this
one<00:03:10.060> right<00:03:10.210> here<00:03:10.450> and<00:03:10.990> anything<00:03:11.980> next<00:03:12.130> to<00:03:12.340> that

00:03:12.510 --> 00:03:12.520 
one right here and anything next to that

00:03:12.520 --> 00:03:14.460 
one right here and anything next to that
cube<00:03:12.850> was<00:03:13.120> powered<00:03:13.540> as<00:03:13.660> well<00:03:13.810> and<00:03:14.050> right<00:03:14.200> right

00:03:14.460 --> 00:03:14.470 
cube was powered as well and right right

00:03:14.470 --> 00:03:17.130 
cube was powered as well and right right
directly<00:03:15.040> behind<00:03:15.340> it<00:03:15.670> is<00:03:15.820> a<00:03:16.120> TNT<00:03:16.630> block<00:03:16.900> and

00:03:17.130 --> 00:03:17.140 
directly behind it is a TNT block and

00:03:17.140 --> 00:03:19.350 
directly behind it is a TNT block and
same<00:03:17.890> with<00:03:17.920> everything<00:03:18.730> else<00:03:18.910> it's<00:03:19.120> just

00:03:19.350 --> 00:03:19.360 
same with everything else it's just

00:03:19.360 --> 00:03:23.850 
same with everything else it's just
everything<00:03:20.320> else<00:03:22.080> so<00:03:23.080> if<00:03:23.170> we<00:03:23.230> go<00:03:23.380> downstairs

00:03:23.850 --> 00:03:23.860 
everything else so if we go downstairs

00:03:23.860 --> 00:03:27.630 
everything else so if we go downstairs
and<00:03:24.100> activate<00:03:24.580> that<00:03:24.760> system<00:03:26.010> this<00:03:27.010> is<00:03:27.190> my<00:03:27.310> cube

00:03:27.630 --> 00:03:27.640 
and activate that system this is my cube

00:03:27.640 --> 00:03:30.810 
and activate that system this is my cube
it's<00:03:27.850> incomplete<00:03:28.300> I'll<00:03:28.840> fix<00:03:29.230> it<00:03:29.320> later<00:03:29.760> it's<00:03:30.760> a

00:03:30.810 --> 00:03:30.820 
it's incomplete I'll fix it later it's a

00:03:30.820 --> 00:03:38.510 
it's incomplete I'll fix it later it's a
very<00:03:31.030> big<00:03:31.180> cube<00:03:34.740> the<00:03:35.740> TNT<00:03:36.100> block<00:03:36.340> explodes

00:03:38.510 --> 00:03:38.520 
very big cube the TNT block explodes

00:03:38.520 --> 00:03:40.710 
very big cube the TNT block explodes
cobblestone<00:03:39.520> is<00:03:39.670> destroyed<00:03:40.060> and<00:03:40.090> behind<00:03:40.570> that

cobblestone is destroyed and behind that

00:03:40.720 --> 00:03:44.760 
cobblestone is destroyed and behind that
cobblestone<00:03:41.320> is<00:03:41.640> lava<00:03:43.650> basically<00:03:44.650> that's

00:03:44.760 --> 00:03:44.770 
cobblestone is lava basically that's

00:03:44.770 --> 00:03:47.610 
cobblestone is lava basically that's
what<00:03:44.980> it<00:03:45.070> looks<00:03:45.220> like<00:03:45.840> the<00:03:46.840> holes<00:03:47.050> are<00:03:47.200> flooded

00:03:47.610 --> 00:03:47.620 
what it looks like the holes are flooded

00:03:47.620 --> 00:03:51.270 
what it looks like the holes are flooded
with<00:03:47.950> lava<00:03:48.330> it's<00:03:49.330> just<00:03:49.480> been<00:03:49.600> saved<00:03:49.930> but<00:03:50.280> you

00:03:51.270 --> 00:03:51.280 
with lava it's just been saved but you

00:03:51.280 --> 00:03:52.980 
with lava it's just been saved but you
have<00:03:51.430> to<00:03:51.610> plug<00:03:51.820> each<00:03:52.000> hole<00:03:52.209> individually<00:03:52.870> if

00:03:52.980 --> 00:03:52.990 
have to plug each hole individually if

00:03:52.990 --> 00:03:56.699 
have to plug each hole individually if
you<00:03:53.140> want<00:03:53.380> to<00:03:53.620> reuse<00:03:54.370> it<00:03:54.520> again<00:03:54.580> but<00:03:55.510> this<00:03:56.020> this

00:03:56.699 --> 00:03:56.709 
you want to reuse it again but this this

00:03:56.709 --> 00:03:58.440 
you want to reuse it again but this this
is<00:03:56.770> one<00:03:57.550> of<00:03:57.580> those<00:03:57.730> things<00:03:57.940> you<00:03:58.090> can't<00:03:58.330> really

00:03:58.440 --> 00:03:58.450 
is one of those things you can't really

00:03:58.450 --> 00:04:02.790 
is one of those things you can't really
reuse<00:04:00.540> emergency<00:04:01.540> one-time<00:04:02.080> use<00:04:02.320> lava

00:04:02.790 --> 00:04:02.800 
reuse emergency one-time use lava

00:04:02.800 --> 00:04:05.340 
reuse emergency one-time use lava
flutter<00:04:03.190> so<00:04:03.760> there<00:04:04.120> you<00:04:04.150> have<00:04:04.270> it<00:04:04.450> as<00:04:04.720> you<00:04:05.200> can

00:04:05.340 --> 00:04:05.350 
flutter so there you have it as you can

00:04:05.350 --> 00:04:07.440 
flutter so there you have it as you can
see<00:04:05.530> it's<00:04:05.650> a<00:04:05.890> wonderful<00:04:06.790> system<00:04:07.000> it'll<00:04:07.330> go

00:04:07.440 --> 00:04:07.450 
see it's a wonderful system it'll go

00:04:07.450 --> 00:04:09.750 
see it's a wonderful system it'll go
down<00:04:07.480> all<00:04:07.870> the<00:04:07.990> way<00:04:08.170> and<00:04:09.040> I'll<00:04:09.250> take<00:04:09.459> a<00:04:09.490> step

00:04:09.750 --> 00:04:09.760 
down all the way and I'll take a step

00:04:09.760 --> 00:04:11.250 
down all the way and I'll take a step
outside<00:04:09.880> to<00:04:10.150> show<00:04:10.450> you<00:04:10.510> all<00:04:10.720> what<00:04:11.020> it<00:04:11.110> looks

outside to show you all what it looks

00:04:11.260 --> 00:04:17.229 
outside to show you all what it looks
like<00:04:11.440> in<00:04:11.790> a<00:04:12.790> moment

down through this water elevator as you
can<00:04:22.440> see<00:04:22.590> that's<00:04:22.830> the<00:04:23.010> effect<00:04:23.850> of<00:04:24.060> the

00:04:24.230 --> 00:04:24.240 
can see that's the effect of the

00:04:24.240 --> 00:04:29.480 
can see that's the effect of the
secondary<00:04:26.480> weapon<00:04:27.480> system<00:04:27.870> fire<00:04:28.230> it's<00:04:28.620> just

00:04:29.480 --> 00:04:29.490 
secondary weapon system fire it's just

00:04:29.490 --> 00:04:32.060 
secondary weapon system fire it's just
this<00:04:30.480> is<00:04:30.690> what<00:04:30.870> it<00:04:30.990> looks<00:04:31.169> like<00:04:31.350> all<00:04:31.680> the<00:04:31.889> lava

00:04:32.060 --> 00:04:32.070 
this is what it looks like all the lava

00:04:32.070 --> 00:04:33.350 
this is what it looks like all the lava
coming<00:04:32.370> down<00:04:32.580> through<00:04:32.760> all<00:04:32.850> the<00:04:32.940> holes<00:04:33.120> know

00:04:33.350 --> 00:04:33.360 
coming down through all the holes know

00:04:33.360 --> 00:04:38.210 
coming down through all the holes know
what<00:04:33.450> climb<00:04:33.720> through<00:04:33.960> it<00:04:36.710> of<00:04:37.710> course<00:04:37.950> I<00:04:38.070> can

00:04:38.210 --> 00:04:38.220 
what climb through it of course I can

00:04:38.220 --> 00:04:39.590 
what climb through it of course I can
just<00:04:38.400> climb<00:04:38.639> fitter<00:04:38.910> you<00:04:39.030> can't<00:04:39.270> even<00:04:39.450> use<00:04:39.540> a

00:04:39.590 --> 00:04:39.600 
just climb fitter you can't even use a

00:04:39.600 --> 00:04:42.260 
just climb fitter you can't even use a
system<00:04:39.900> anymore<00:04:40.169> this<00:04:40.950> is<00:04:41.130> if<00:04:41.310> you<00:04:41.910> could<00:04:42.090> plug

00:04:42.260 --> 00:04:42.270 
system anymore this is if you could plug

00:04:42.270 --> 00:04:45.969 
system anymore this is if you could plug
the<00:04:42.450> system<00:04:42.810> again<00:04:43.020> like<00:04:43.200> I<00:04:43.320> said<00:04:43.350> before<00:04:43.650> but

00:04:45.969 --> 00:04:45.979 
the system again like I said before but

00:04:45.979 --> 00:04:53.870 
the system again like I said before but
this<00:04:46.979> is<00:04:47.160> quite<00:04:47.370> a<00:04:47.400> climb<00:04:47.700> I<00:04:52.639> was<00:04:53.639> trying<00:04:53.729> to

00:04:53.870 --> 00:04:53.880 
this is quite a climb I was trying to

00:04:53.880 --> 00:04:55.940 
this is quite a climb I was trying to
make<00:04:54.060> a<00:04:54.240> drop<00:04:55.020> tube<00:04:55.290> system<00:04:55.740> where<00:04:55.889> it

00:04:55.940 --> 00:04:55.950 
make a drop tube system where it

00:04:55.950 --> 00:04:57.140 
make a drop tube system where it
explodes<00:04:56.340> like<00:04:56.520> let's<00:04:56.790> say<00:04:56.880> when<00:04:57.090> I'm

00:04:57.140 --> 00:04:57.150 
explodes like let's say when I'm

00:04:57.150 --> 00:05:00.050 
explodes like let's say when I'm
standing<00:04:57.510> out<00:04:57.630> right<00:04:57.810> now<00:04:57.960> but<00:04:58.790> Santi<00:04:59.790> drops

00:05:00.050 --> 00:05:00.060 
standing out right now but Santi drops

00:05:00.060 --> 00:05:02.420 
standing out right now but Santi drops
really<00:05:00.419> fast<00:05:00.720> and<00:05:01.080> it<00:05:01.740> would<00:05:01.919> take<00:05:02.100> a<00:05:02.130> while

00:05:02.420 --> 00:05:02.430 
really fast and it would take a while

00:05:02.430 --> 00:05:06.890 
really fast and it would take a while
probably<00:05:03.120> slow<00:05:03.600> sand<00:05:03.930> but<00:05:05.360> still<00:05:06.360> I'd<00:05:06.540> have<00:05:06.720> to

00:05:06.890 --> 00:05:06.900 
probably slow sand but still I'd have to

00:05:06.900 --> 00:05:09.110 
probably slow sand but still I'd have to
use<00:05:07.080> a<00:05:07.250> significant<00:05:08.250> portion<00:05:08.460> of<00:05:08.729> the<00:05:08.850> queue

00:05:09.110 --> 00:05:09.120 
use a significant portion of the queue

00:05:09.120 --> 00:05:12.110 
use a significant portion of the queue
just<00:05:09.780> so<00:05:09.870> that<00:05:10.050> the<00:05:10.229> TNT<00:05:10.830> can<00:05:10.979> still<00:05:11.220> fall<00:05:11.820> down

00:05:12.110 --> 00:05:12.120 
just so that the TNT can still fall down

00:05:12.120 --> 00:05:26.120 
just so that the TNT can still fall down
I<00:05:22.700> don't<00:05:23.700> know<00:05:23.789> but<00:05:23.820> maybe<00:05:24.120> I'm<00:05:24.390> going<00:05:24.630> to<00:05:25.130> make

00:05:26.120 --> 00:05:26.130 
I don't know but maybe I'm going to make

00:05:26.130 --> 00:05:28.940 
I don't know but maybe I'm going to make
something<00:05:26.810> flood<00:05:27.810> this<00:05:27.900> whole<00:05:28.080> floor<00:05:28.560> in<00:05:28.830> the

00:05:28.940 --> 00:05:28.950 
something flood this whole floor in the

00:05:28.950 --> 00:05:31.550 
something flood this whole floor in the
future<00:05:29.720> anyways<00:05:30.720> those<00:05:30.990> you<00:05:31.140> have<00:05:31.289> it<00:05:31.470> that's

00:05:31.550 --> 00:05:31.560 
future anyways those you have it that's

00:05:31.560 --> 00:05:33.440 
future anyways those you have it that's
the<00:05:31.740> new<00:05:31.860> weapon<00:05:32.190> system<00:05:32.220> perhaps<00:05:32.910> I'll<00:05:33.150> make

00:05:33.440 --> 00:05:33.450 
the new weapon system perhaps I'll make

00:05:33.450 --> 00:05:37.130 
the new weapon system perhaps I'll make
this<00:05:33.600> whole<00:05:33.810> floor<00:05:35.090> flutterville<00:05:36.090> perhaps<00:05:36.750> in

00:05:37.130 --> 00:05:37.140 
this whole floor flutterville perhaps in

00:05:37.140 --> 00:05:40.970 
this whole floor flutterville perhaps in
the<00:05:37.229> future<00:05:37.430> thanks<00:05:38.430> for<00:05:38.460> watching
