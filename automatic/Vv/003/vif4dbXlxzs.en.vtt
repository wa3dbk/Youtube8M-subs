00:00:06.610 --> 00:00:10.570
 the adventure that came out raga prepared 

00:00:08.650 --> 00:00:12.460
 today for all of us it is in santa rosa 

00:00:10.570 --> 00:00:14.170
 of cabal the jets of gift are not it 

00:00:12.460 --> 00:00:17.670
 the waterfalls we know today 

00:00:14.170 --> 00:00:17.670
 laugh something new hundred 

00:00:25.690 --> 00:00:29.200
 They want to know how I got to this 

00:00:27.700 --> 00:00:30.970
 wonderful landscape that is in my 

00:00:29.200 --> 00:00:34.130
 back then that is what we will see today 

00:00:30.970 --> 00:00:36.520
 in risaralda something new always 

00:00:34.130 --> 00:00:36.520
 here 

00:00:50.859 --> 00:00:54.949
 so to get here first thing 

00:00:53.059 --> 00:00:56.839
 what we did was to undertake a walk 

00:00:54.949 --> 00:00:59.000
 that took a moderate step and 

00:00:56.839 --> 00:01:01.010
 enjoying the landscape an hour and a half 

00:00:59.000 --> 00:01:02.449
 the first thing they should do is get there 

00:01:01.010 --> 00:01:04.399
 to the municipality of Santa Rosa de 

00:01:02.449 --> 00:01:06.979
 and take a transport to the 

00:01:04.399 --> 00:01:09.229
 site known as lolo that travel 

00:01:06.979 --> 00:01:11.450
 it does not take more than five minutes something very 

00:01:09.229 --> 00:01:13.520
 important is to keep in mind that when 

00:01:11.450 --> 00:01:17.170
 measures venture into the forest 

00:01:13.520 --> 00:01:17.170
 Security can not be left aside 

00:01:18.039 --> 00:01:22.640
 well arbey is not that I 'm burning 

00:01:20.299 --> 00:01:24.679
 but the humidity of this forest 

00:01:22.640 --> 00:01:27.709
 tropical in which does not smoke 

00:01:24.679 --> 00:01:29.630
 not exact yes sir good arbey this guy 

00:01:27.709 --> 00:01:31.970
 of walking without doubts are wonderful 

00:01:29.630 --> 00:01:33.709
 but let's tell people what measures 

00:01:31.970 --> 00:01:35.890
 they should be taken when they come to do 

00:01:33.709 --> 00:01:38.270
 this type of tours is hiking type 

00:01:35.890 --> 00:01:41.750
 good many people think hiking 

00:01:38.270 --> 00:01:44.750
 it is simply to start walking and 

00:01:41.750 --> 00:01:48.380
 you have to have some security measures 

00:01:44.750 --> 00:01:50.630
 the main one logically is to see the the 

00:01:48.380 --> 00:01:52.729
 weather condition when there is a lot 

00:01:50.630 --> 00:01:55.480
 winter in a forest like this and more 

00:01:52.729 --> 00:01:57.730
 when we are going to walk near a river 

00:01:55.480 --> 00:02:01.000
 very careful because I could 

00:01:57.730 --> 00:02:02.860
 present a growing and another of those of 

00:02:01.000 --> 00:02:07.000
 the recommendations is always to have 

00:02:02.860 --> 00:02:10.360
 closed shoes with a hard sole 

00:02:07.000 --> 00:02:13.300
 allow a good grip and always when giving 

00:02:10.360 --> 00:02:15.310
 one step you have to be sure that the foot 

00:02:13.300 --> 00:02:16.840
 which is already in place is firm for 

00:02:15.310 --> 00:02:19.560
 can lift the other foot since this 

00:02:16.840 --> 00:02:22.150
 it could also cause an injury 

00:02:19.560 --> 00:02:24.840
 let's keep walking and go to the jets 

00:02:22.150 --> 00:02:24.840
 of pain 

00:02:27.630 --> 00:02:32.590
 look at this path that is 

00:02:30.460 --> 00:02:35.530
 1900 meters above sea level 

00:02:32.590 --> 00:02:37.240
 offers a pure air are dozens of 

00:02:35.530 --> 00:02:39.340
 hectares of secondary forest that the 

00:02:37.240 --> 00:02:41.650
 simple fact of breathing make it 

00:02:39.340 --> 00:02:43.420
 an unparalleled experience literally 

00:02:41.650 --> 00:02:45.970
 you have to get between the roots of 

00:02:43.420 --> 00:02:48.460
 trees a thick jungle that from so much in 

00:02:45.970 --> 00:02:50.680
 when it timidly lets in the sun 

00:02:48.460 --> 00:02:52.810
 this is a walk for all the 

00:02:50.680 --> 00:02:55.460
 family and of course the children are 

00:02:52.810 --> 00:02:57.430
 who most enjoy the tour 

00:02:55.460 --> 00:03:01.409
 now we see 

00:02:57.430 --> 00:03:01.409

00:03:05.069 --> 00:03:10.819
 when you have a healthy way of 

00:03:07.650 --> 00:03:13.819
 move in front of me 

00:03:10.819 --> 00:03:13.819
 Water 

00:03:16.060 --> 00:03:25.500

 go down 

00:04:09.280 --> 00:04:13.990
 this is the relaxing view that leaves us 

00:04:11.800 --> 00:04:16.690
 perplexed by the poetry that recites the 

00:04:13.990 --> 00:04:19.000
 nature a space that exists with or 

00:04:16.690 --> 00:04:20.709
