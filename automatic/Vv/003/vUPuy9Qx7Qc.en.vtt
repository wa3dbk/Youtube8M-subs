Fuji has come out with a micro guide and
that's<00:01:43.259> what<00:01:43.470> the<00:01:43.799> trays<00:01:44.130> using<00:01:44.490> on<00:01:44.579> this<00:01:44.729> rod

00:01:44.990 --> 00:01:45.000

that's what the trays using on this rod
that<00:01:45.810> guide<00:01:46.170> is<00:01:46.380> super<00:01:46.799> small<00:01:47.100> all<00:01:47.460> the<00:01:47.939> way

00:01:48.109 --> 00:01:48.119 
that guide is super small all the way

00:01:48.119 --> 00:01:50.749 
that guide is super small all the way
down<00:01:48.450> the<00:01:49.259> rod<00:01:49.470> all<00:01:49.829> the<00:01:50.130> way<00:01:50.250> to<00:01:50.310> the<00:01:50.490> tip

now<00:01:52.510> I<00:01:52.540> bet<00:01:52.810> you're<00:01:52.960> wondering<00:01:53.380> I<00:01:53.500> wonder<00:01:53.740> hot

00:01:53.880 --> 00:01:53.890 
now I bet you're wondering I wonder hot

00:01:53.890 --> 00:01:56.730 
now I bet you're wondering I wonder hot
Cass<00:01:54.160> well<00:01:55.060> actually<00:01:55.330> this<00:01:55.870> rod<00:01:56.110> casts<00:01:56.530> a<00:01:56.590> lot

00:01:56.730 --> 00:01:56.740 
Cass well actually this rod casts a lot

00:01:56.740 --> 00:01:58.230 
Cass well actually this rod casts a lot
better<00:01:56.920> than<00:01:57.160> you<00:01:57.250> think<00:01:57.460> it<00:01:57.670> casts<00:01:58.000> better

00:01:58.230 --> 00:01:58.240 
better than you think it casts better

00:01:58.240 --> 00:02:00.600 
better than you think it casts better
with<00:01:58.960> the<00:01:59.110> smaller<00:01:59.470> guides<00:01:59.830> that<00:02:00.250> it<00:02:00.400> actually

00:02:00.600 --> 00:02:00.610 
with the smaller guides that it actually

00:02:00.610 --> 00:02:02.280 
with the smaller guides that it actually
does<00:02:01.030> with<00:02:01.210> bigger<00:02:01.390> guys<00:02:01.630> you<00:02:01.660> have<00:02:01.990> less

00:02:02.280 --> 00:02:02.290 
does with bigger guys you have less

real and it actually travels through
these<00:02:08.890> smaller<00:02:09.310> guides<00:02:09.640> it<00:02:10.540> keeps<00:02:10.810> the<00:02:10.990> line

00:02:11.220 --> 00:02:11.230 
these smaller guides it keeps the line

00:02:11.230 --> 00:02:14.100 
these smaller guides it keeps the line
straighter<00:02:11.800> and<00:02:12.160> allows<00:02:12.760> that<00:02:13.030> bait<00:02:13.420> to<00:02:13.720> go

00:02:14.100 --> 00:02:14.110 
straighter and allows that bait to go

00:02:14.110 --> 00:02:16.200 
straighter and allows that bait to go
farther<00:02:14.500> and<00:02:14.920> more<00:02:15.280> accurately<00:02:15.850> and<00:02:16.090> that's

farther and more accurately and that's

00:02:16.210 --> 00:02:19.080 
farther and more accurately and that's
the<00:02:16.390> key<00:02:16.600> to<00:02:16.720> that<00:02:17.310> the<00:02:18.310> other<00:02:18.430> advantage<00:02:18.670> with

feel<00:02:48.850> everything<00:02:49.390> and<00:02:49.600> that's<00:02:49.660> real

00:02:49.949 --> 00:02:49.959 
feel everything and that's real

00:02:49.959 --> 00:02:51.630 
feel everything and that's real
important<00:02:50.470> you're<00:02:50.590> fishing<00:02:50.980> you<00:02:51.490> know<00:02:51.580> you

00:02:51.630 --> 00:02:51.640 
important you're fishing you know you

00:02:51.640 --> 00:02:52.830 
important you're fishing you know you
want<00:02:51.850> to<00:02:51.880> be<00:02:51.970> able<00:02:52.030> to<00:02:52.180> fill<00:02:52.390> what's<00:02:52.630> down

00:02:52.830 --> 00:02:52.840 
want to be able to fill what's down

00:02:52.840 --> 00:02:54.870 
want to be able to fill what's down
there<00:02:53.110> you<00:02:53.830> also<00:02:54.010> want<00:02:54.220> to<00:02:54.430> feel<00:02:54.580> the<00:02:54.670> fish

00:02:54.870 --> 00:02:54.880 
there you also want to feel the fish

00:02:54.880 --> 00:02:56.490 
there you also want to feel the fish
bite<00:02:55.120> so<00:02:55.450> that's<00:02:55.630> what's<00:02:55.810> really<00:02:55.989> important

00:02:56.490 --> 00:02:56.500 
bite so that's what's really important
