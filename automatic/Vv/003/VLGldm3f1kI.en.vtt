00:00:16.099 --> 00:00:24.220

00:00:24.220 --> 00:00:28.810
 it's a fight we can fight in battle 

00:00:27.400 --> 00:00:33.280
 of three against three with the different 

00:00:28.810 --> 00:00:37.710
 genders and villains of the world of faith 

00:00:33.280 --> 00:00:37.710
 but comics and it's very simple 

00:00:38.010 --> 00:00:42.170
 to perform normal hits 

00:00:39.239 --> 00:00:45.089
 we will simply touch on the enemy 

00:00:42.170 --> 00:00:47.039
 then there will be a kind of little arrow with 

00:00:45.089 --> 00:00:49.559
 which we can make a combo like 

00:00:47.039 --> 00:00:51.809

 fighting at first you may 

00:02:43.170 --> 00:02:48.030
