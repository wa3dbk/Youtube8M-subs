electric oven never had an electric oven
before<00:01:35.070> as<00:01:35.369> well<00:01:35.520> so<00:01:35.759> I'm<00:01:36.000> not<00:01:36.150> quite<00:01:36.270> sure

00:01:36.380 --> 00:01:36.390 
before as well so I'm not quite sure

00:01:36.390 --> 00:01:38.300 
before as well so I'm not quite sure
what<00:01:37.320> to<00:01:37.439> expect<00:01:37.500> I<00:01:37.920> did<00:01:38.040> a<00:01:38.070> bit<00:01:38.189> of<00:01:38.220> research

00:01:38.300 --> 00:01:38.310 
what to expect I did a bit of research

00:01:38.310 --> 00:01:41.600 
what to expect I did a bit of research
and<00:01:38.939> the<00:01:39.390> general<00:01:39.829> agreement<00:01:40.829> seem<00:01:41.430> to<00:01:41.520> be

00:01:41.600 --> 00:01:41.610 
and the general agreement seem to be

00:01:41.610 --> 00:01:42.950 
and the general agreement seem to be
that<00:01:41.700> electric<00:01:42.090> ovens<00:01:42.329> are<00:01:42.450> much<00:01:42.630> more

00:01:42.950 --> 00:01:42.960 
that electric ovens are much more

00:01:42.960 --> 00:01:45.080 
that electric ovens are much more
controllable<00:01:43.799> you<00:01:44.549> get<00:01:44.700> a<00:01:44.729> lot<00:01:44.880> better

00:01:45.080 --> 00:01:45.090 
controllable you get a lot better

00:01:45.090 --> 00:01:47.210 
controllable you get a lot better
results<00:01:45.210> with<00:01:45.720> them<00:01:45.869> so<00:01:46.079> I<00:01:46.320> kind<00:01:46.799> of<00:01:46.829> went<00:01:47.009> for

00:01:47.210 --> 00:01:47.220 
results with them so I kind of went for

00:01:47.220 --> 00:01:49.880 
results with them so I kind of went for
one<00:01:47.369> and<00:01:47.759> there's<00:01:48.360> my<00:01:48.450> new<00:01:48.630> oven<00:01:49.290> there<00:01:49.649> I<00:01:49.680> work

00:01:49.880 --> 00:01:49.890 
one and there's my new oven there I work

00:01:49.890 --> 00:01:51.710 
one and there's my new oven there I work
for<00:01:50.040> a<00:01:50.070> double<00:01:50.369> a<00:01:50.549> double<00:01:50.610> one<00:01:51.060> double<00:01:51.479> oven

00:01:51.710 --> 00:01:51.720 
for a double a double one double oven

00:01:51.720 --> 00:01:53.450 
for a double a double one double oven
but<00:01:51.960> so<00:01:52.170> it's<00:01:52.290> got<00:01:52.409> a<00:01:52.439> separate<00:01:52.860> grill<00:01:53.130> bit<00:01:53.369> on

00:01:53.450 --> 00:01:53.460 
but so it's got a separate grill bit on

00:01:53.460 --> 00:01:56.330 
but so it's got a separate grill bit on
the<00:01:53.579> top<00:01:54.649> so<00:01:55.649> hopefully<00:01:56.009> it<00:01:56.070> was<00:01:56.159> the<00:01:56.219> right

00:01:56.330 --> 00:01:56.340 
the top so hopefully it was the right

00:01:56.340 --> 00:01:58.730 
the top so hopefully it was the right
choice<00:01:56.600> and<00:01:57.600> as<00:01:57.869> I<00:01:57.960> say<00:01:58.140> all<00:01:58.259> these<00:01:58.350> all<00:01:58.619> the

00:01:58.730 --> 00:01:58.740 
choice and as I say all these all the

00:01:58.740 --> 00:02:00.380 
choice and as I say all these all the
carcasses<00:01:58.950> in<00:01:59.280> here<00:01:59.579> they're<00:01:59.880> kind<00:02:00.119> of<00:02:00.210> ready

00:02:00.380 --> 00:02:00.390 
carcasses in here they're kind of ready

00:02:00.390 --> 00:02:02.300 
carcasses in here they're kind of ready
they're<00:02:00.869> already<00:02:01.110> made<00:02:01.409> up<00:02:01.619> which<00:02:01.799> is<00:02:01.920> useful

00:02:02.300 --> 00:02:02.310 
they're already made up which is useful

00:02:02.310 --> 00:02:04.370 
they're already made up which is useful
so<00:02:02.430> I<00:02:02.490> don't<00:02:02.640> have<00:02:02.729> to<00:02:02.880> spend<00:02:03.659> you<00:02:03.840> know<00:02:03.869> a<00:02:04.140> week

00:02:04.370 --> 00:02:04.380 
so I don't have to spend you know a week

00:02:04.380 --> 00:02:06.499 
so I don't have to spend you know a week
putting<00:02:04.829> them<00:02:04.979> together<00:02:05.149> obviously<00:02:06.149> the

00:02:06.499 --> 00:02:06.509 
putting them together obviously the

00:02:06.509 --> 00:02:07.550 
putting them together obviously the
doors<00:02:06.750> and<00:02:06.990> everything

00:02:07.550 --> 00:02:07.560 
doors and everything

00:02:07.560 --> 00:02:09.440 
doors and everything
and<00:02:07.740> all<00:02:07.920> the<00:02:08.039> governor<00:02:08.340> can<00:02:08.880> believe<00:02:09.240> there

00:02:09.440 --> 00:02:09.450 
and all the governor can believe there

00:02:09.450 --> 00:02:11.900 
and all the governor can believe there
was<00:02:09.539> an<00:02:09.630> entire<00:02:10.020> van<00:02:10.440> load<00:02:10.679> arrived<00:02:11.160> this

00:02:11.900 --> 00:02:11.910 
was an entire van load arrived this

00:02:11.910 --> 00:02:14.870 
was an entire van load arrived this
afternoon<00:02:12.090> it<00:02:12.959> filled<00:02:13.319> up<00:02:13.530> a<00:02:13.709> whole<00:02:13.770> van<00:02:14.520> and

00:02:14.870 --> 00:02:14.880 
afternoon it filled up a whole van and

00:02:14.880 --> 00:02:16.910 
afternoon it filled up a whole van and
it<00:02:15.300> was<00:02:15.390> a<00:02:15.420> big<00:02:15.690> long<00:02:16.020> wheelbase<00:02:16.260> fan<00:02:16.709> as<00:02:16.890> well

00:02:16.910 --> 00:02:16.920 
it was a big long wheelbase fan as well

00:02:16.920 --> 00:02:19.190 
it was a big long wheelbase fan as well
so<00:02:17.430> it<00:02:17.880> was<00:02:18.000> only<00:02:18.120> two<00:02:18.390> of<00:02:18.420> us<00:02:18.600> but<00:02:18.840> we<00:02:18.959> managed

00:02:19.190 --> 00:02:19.200 
so it was only two of us but we managed

00:02:19.200 --> 00:02:21.949 
so it was only two of us but we managed
to<00:02:19.280> do<00:02:20.280> it<00:02:20.400> in<00:02:20.459> about<00:02:20.550> an<00:02:20.790> hour<00:02:20.940> so<00:02:21.540> that<00:02:21.569> was

00:02:21.949 --> 00:02:21.959 
to do it in about an hour so that was

00:02:21.959 --> 00:02:22.280 
to do it in about an hour so that was
good

00:02:22.280 --> 00:02:22.290 
good

00:02:22.290 --> 00:02:24.590 
good
