00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:14.219
 You're already part of our class 8 of mine. 

00:00:11.519 --> 00:00:18.779
 today we are going to open another toy 

00:00:14.219 --> 00:00:21.779
 the freshly painted chicken he's walking 

00:00:18.779 --> 00:00:25.380
 musical entertainment 

00:00:21.779 --> 00:00:27.500
 he comes with the chicken walking with two 

00:00:25.380 --> 00:00:30.630
 we feel hopscotch 

00:00:27.500 --> 00:00:33.989
 Let's see what this toy is 

00:00:30.630 --> 00:00:36.360
 Let's see what he does when she walks. 

00:00:33.989 --> 00:00:39.570
 flap your wings 

00:00:36.360 --> 00:00:44.960
 hold the string and I passed the chicken 

00:00:39.570 --> 00:00:44.960
 The chick is very happy. 

00:00:51.289 --> 00:00:59.850
 when she walks she flaps her wings and 

00:00:56.730 --> 00:01:03.090
 move if the border a beautiful 

00:00:59.850 --> 00:01:05.700
 melody that melody will be 

00:01:03.090 --> 00:01:08.400
 Let's find out the tour is more 

00:01:05.700 --> 00:01:11.850
 hilarious with hen guinea pigs 

00:01:08.400 --> 00:01:13.830
 their chicks pull the cord that they 

00:01:11.850 --> 00:01:16.290
 walk behind you 

00:01:13.830 --> 00:01:17.549
 Oh cool, it seems to be pretty good. 

00:01:16.290 --> 00:01:20.390
 funny 

00:01:17.549 --> 00:01:20.390
 so let's open 

00:01:22.070 --> 00:01:50.569
 [Music] 

00:01:50.970 --> 00:02:32.400
 but we have to put the pile here and 

00:01:54.940 --> 00:02:32.400

00:02:49.410 --> 00:02:58.389

00:02:59.030 --> 00:03:03.470
