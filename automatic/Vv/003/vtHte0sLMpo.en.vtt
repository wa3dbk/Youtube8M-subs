00:00:03.840 --> 00:00:06.870
 hello my name is veronika welcome 

00:00:05.850 --> 00:00:08.730
 to the channel 

00:00:06.870 --> 00:00:11.580
 the needle today we will fight with you 

00:00:08.730 --> 00:00:13.980
 bright gel eyeliner and 

00:00:11.580 --> 00:00:17.250
 I got a bronzer 

00:00:13.980 --> 00:00:20.250
 Makeup summer enough bright already so 

00:00:17.250 --> 00:00:23.060
 sunny and so let me show you 

00:00:20.250 --> 00:00:23.060
 how did she do 

00:00:28.230 --> 00:00:35.620
 I have already made a foundation on the face on the face 

00:00:31.539 --> 00:00:38.350
 me here is such a cream base also 

00:00:35.620 --> 00:00:41.190
 I have such a concealer under 

00:00:38.350 --> 00:00:41.190
 eyes and 

00:00:41.620 --> 00:00:47.500
 I'm gonna powder on top 

00:00:44.680 --> 00:00:53.260
 Why do you need our morning bronzer which 

00:00:47.500 --> 00:00:56.230
 we will use now lay with us 

00:00:53.260 --> 00:00:59.470
 more evenly shade and not 

00:00:56.230 --> 00:01:04.119
 lay down some spots that is to 

00:00:59.470 --> 00:01:06.789
 our foundation and it didn't cling like 

00:01:04.119 --> 00:01:11.050
 first to use this base under 

00:01:06.789 --> 00:01:14.670
 shadows and even out the shade of the eyelids to us 

00:01:11.050 --> 00:01:17.380
 all levels and kept and the best went to bed 

00:01:14.670 --> 00:01:20.200
 I will show you two options today 

00:01:17.380 --> 00:01:22.330
 use bright eyeliner 

00:01:20.200 --> 00:01:23.979
 we will use this bright 

00:01:22.330 --> 00:01:26.679
 yellow number 84 

00:01:23.979 --> 00:01:29.320
 using extra black and 

00:01:26.679 --> 00:01:32.710
 without first of course let's 

00:01:29.320 --> 00:01:35.680
 use weight what else would I like 

00:01:32.710 --> 00:01:38.619
 do i would take with help in such here 

00:01:35.680 --> 00:01:41.229
 big shading brush our 

00:01:38.619 --> 00:01:44.939
 bronzer which we will and use 

00:01:41.229 --> 00:01:48.250
 later and would carry him over here 

00:01:44.939 --> 00:01:55.649
 fold of the century rather a little higher fold 

00:01:48.250 --> 00:01:59.049
 to emphasize a little eye and to 

00:01:55.649 --> 00:02:02.200
 subsequently underline 

00:01:59.049 --> 00:02:04.780
 our bright eyeliner also using 

00:02:02.200 --> 00:02:06.729
 pencil brush here such here we take 

00:02:04.780 --> 00:02:10.209
 Again our bronzer 

00:02:06.729 --> 00:02:15.610
 and put it here under the lower eyelid and 

00:02:10.209 --> 00:02:17.230
 I shade the same brush now I 

00:02:15.610 --> 00:02:21.220
 I want to take a little bit of highlighter 

00:02:17.230 --> 00:02:23.370
 I'll take these shadows here and put them on 

00:02:21.220 --> 00:02:26.200
 using such a brush on 

00:02:23.370 --> 00:02:31.959
 the inner corner of the eye with us is very 

00:02:26.200 --> 00:02:34.450
 I â€™m getting a nice little backlight 

00:02:31.959 --> 00:02:37.930
 on the eyelids a little bit 

00:02:34.450 --> 00:02:42.250
 well and now we take our stellar bright 

00:02:37.930 --> 00:02:46.750
 yellow eyeliner and take here such 

00:02:42.250 --> 00:02:49.569
 beveled brush and we will apply it 

00:02:46.750 --> 00:02:51.700
 for centuries as you see she is so bright 

00:02:49.569 --> 00:02:54.760
 bright yellow and we put 

00:02:51.700 --> 00:02:56.410
 I will put it thick enough 

00:02:54.760 --> 00:02:57.130
 so that it can be seen first and 

00:02:56.410 --> 00:02:58.420
 there was an effect 

00:02:57.130 --> 00:03:00.040
 and secondly so that we later have 

00:02:58.420 --> 00:03:03.269
 opportunity to add a little black 

00:03:00.040 --> 00:03:03.269
 eyeliner top 

00:03:11.370 --> 00:03:18.299
 like that so she had time to dry 

00:03:15.430 --> 00:03:19.930
 try not to blink after her 

00:03:18.299 --> 00:03:21.969
 inflicted a 

00:03:19.930 --> 00:03:23.739
 look down because otherwise she 

00:03:21.969 --> 00:03:24.670
 imprinted for ever when she 

00:03:23.739 --> 00:03:28.719
 completely dry 

00:03:24.670 --> 00:03:30.549
 she is not going anywhere from you 

00:03:28.719 --> 00:03:31.150
 leave so little wait until she 

00:03:30.549 --> 00:03:35.169
 will dry 

00:03:31.150 --> 00:03:36.790
 if you really want rather soon already 

00:03:35.169 --> 00:03:39.340
 you can use these 

00:03:36.790 --> 00:03:42.010
 here are the yellow shadows on top with the help of here 

00:03:39.340 --> 00:03:47.799
 such a beveled tassels is if u 

00:03:42.010 --> 00:03:48.430
 you have no time to wait for her 

00:03:47.799 --> 00:03:50.709
 will dry 

00:03:48.430 --> 00:03:52.870
 Here we have such a bright juicy 

00:03:50.709 --> 00:03:55.870
 yellow eyeliner can be left like this 

00:03:52.870 --> 00:03:58.989
 add mascara and principle we are ready 

00:03:55.870 --> 00:04:01.840
 but you can also add on top of this 

00:03:58.989 --> 00:04:05.829
 yellow eyeliner can be added more and her 

00:04:01.840 --> 00:04:09.540
 black eyeliner for this i will take 77 

00:04:05.829 --> 00:04:12.359
 black eyeliner and the same brush and 

00:04:09.540 --> 00:04:14.280
 neatly do the arrow more 

00:04:12.359 --> 00:04:18.840
 on top of 

00:04:14.280 --> 00:04:19.989
 to yellow us anyway a little bit 

00:04:18.840 --> 00:04:22.900
 looked through 

00:04:19.989 --> 00:04:25.930
 but also add a black arrow and also 

00:04:22.900 --> 00:04:28.500
 it will be interesting to look we make it 

00:04:25.930 --> 00:04:28.500
 thinner 

00:04:46.760 --> 00:04:51.470
 seal I will not wind it completely 

00:04:50.260 --> 00:04:54.500
 inside 

00:04:51.470 --> 00:04:56.540
 so as not to weigh down the gaze and so on 

00:04:54.500 --> 00:04:58.970
 Here we drew both arrows if we 

00:04:56.540 --> 00:05:03.560
 which is small according to the brand 

00:04:58.970 --> 00:05:06.320
 we want to smooth use wadded 

00:05:03.560 --> 00:05:09.230
 wand now finish our image 

00:05:06.320 --> 00:05:12.670
 I use mascara recently 

00:05:09.230 --> 00:05:12.670
 such a waterproof mascara 

00:05:24.030 --> 00:05:28.930
 own with eye makeup we finished 

00:05:26.740 --> 00:05:32.320
 and now let me show you how 

00:05:28.930 --> 00:05:35.139
 make your face so summer shining 

00:05:32.320 --> 00:05:37.780
 and in bronze of this we will take and such 

00:05:35.139 --> 00:05:40.419
 bronzer and such 

00:05:37.780 --> 00:05:42.729
 brush type browser on brush 

00:05:40.419 --> 00:05:44.560
 shake off a little and we will add 

00:05:42.729 --> 00:05:48.280
 browser on the places where the sun 

00:05:44.560 --> 00:05:50.289
 will naturally touch 

00:05:48.280 --> 00:05:55.090
 of our forest that is it is the top 

00:05:50.289 --> 00:06:00.449
 chipped a little bit for balance down this 

00:05:55.090 --> 00:06:03.210
 nose on top just a little bit 

00:06:00.449 --> 00:06:06.910
 that is, we do not make the contour, we 

00:06:03.210 --> 00:06:10.919
 guarantee face and add powder on 

00:06:06.910 --> 00:06:17.460
 tops chipped this bronzer 

00:06:10.919 --> 00:06:23.020
 quite natural looking and good 

00:06:17.460 --> 00:06:25.900
 underlines facial features on forehead over here 

00:06:23.020 --> 00:06:28.349
 here on the top on the most 

00:06:25.900 --> 00:06:33.639
 protruding part 

00:06:28.349 --> 00:06:37.030
 we add also, and so here and so 

00:06:33.639 --> 00:06:38.919
 our face looks almost finished and us 

00:06:37.030 --> 00:06:40.690
 left only lips on lips i will 

00:06:38.919 --> 00:06:44.110
 use two such products 

00:06:40.690 --> 00:06:46.030
 this is 101 gloss and lip liner number 

00:06:44.110 --> 00:06:48.190
 you are 859 

00:06:46.030 --> 00:06:55.539
 with a pencil, I literally mark 

00:06:48.190 --> 00:06:57.669
 little contour and finish makeup here 

00:06:55.539 --> 00:07:04.090
 this not a constrictor so but at the same time 

00:06:57.669 --> 00:07:07.510
 warm shine also I want to add 

00:07:04.090 --> 00:07:10.690
 here a little highlighter on this here 

00:07:07.510 --> 00:07:14.380
 the upper parts of the school using the same 

00:07:10.690 --> 00:07:18.550
 brushes mix all shades and literally 

00:07:14.380 --> 00:07:21.820
 the final touch is a little highlighter on 

00:07:18.550 --> 00:07:25.180
 the protruding part of our makeup is ready 

00:07:21.820 --> 00:07:27.370
 turned out so juicy bright summer 

00:07:25.180 --> 00:07:30.220
 simple enough in my opinion 

00:07:27.370 --> 00:07:33.180
 option so thanks a lot for attention 

00:07:30.220 --> 00:07:33.180
 goodbye
