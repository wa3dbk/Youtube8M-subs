00:00:54.809 --> 00:00:57.080 
playing back a series of HD videos as
well<00:00:54.989> so<00:00:55.559> really<00:00:55.590> something<00:00:56.309> to<00:00:56.489> tax<00:00:56.789> the

00:00:57.080 --> 00:00:57.090 
well so really something to tax the

00:00:57.090 --> 00:01:01.010 
well so really something to tax the
system<00:00:57.480> and<00:00:57.710> get<00:00:58.710> the<00:00:58.890> heat<00:00:59.190> going<00:00:59.250> on<00:00:59.789> Mac<00:01:00.719> Pro

00:01:01.010 --> 00:01:01.020 
system and get the heat going on Mac Pro

00:01:01.020 --> 00:01:03.470 
system and get the heat going on Mac Pro
it<00:01:01.829> has<00:01:02.010> been<00:01:02.190> switched<00:01:02.460> on<00:01:02.640> for<00:01:02.699> around<00:01:03.329> about

00:01:03.470 --> 00:01:03.480 
it has been switched on for around about

00:01:03.480 --> 00:01:05.390 
it has been switched on for around about
an<00:01:03.629> hour<00:01:03.750> so<00:01:04.110> I'd<00:01:04.229> say<00:01:04.470> it's<00:01:04.650> sort<00:01:05.040> of<00:01:05.159> it<00:01:05.309> is

00:01:05.390 --> 00:01:05.400 
an hour so I'd say it's sort of it is

00:01:05.400 --> 00:01:08.000 
an hour so I'd say it's sort of it is
optimum<00:01:06.090> sore<00:01:06.659> temperature<00:01:07.229> at<00:01:07.590> the<00:01:07.680> moment

00:01:08.000 --> 00:01:08.010 
optimum sore temperature at the moment

00:01:08.010 --> 00:01:10.640 
optimum sore temperature at the moment
and<00:01:08.130> hopefully<00:01:08.820> during<00:01:09.420> this<00:01:09.720> video<00:01:09.930> we<00:01:10.320> might

00:01:10.640 --> 00:01:10.650 
and hopefully during this video we might

00:01:10.650 --> 00:01:13.609 
and hopefully during this video we might
see<00:01:10.920> that<00:01:11.130> heat<00:01:11.310> increase<00:01:11.909> as<00:01:12.240> the<00:01:13.170> videos

00:01:13.609 --> 00:01:13.619 
see that heat increase as the videos

00:01:13.619 --> 00:01:15.920 
see that heat increase as the videos
playback<00:01:14.189> so<00:01:15.060> first<00:01:15.270> of<00:01:15.390> all<00:01:15.420> let<00:01:15.600> me<00:01:15.630> show<00:01:15.720> you

playback so first of all let me show you
this<00:01:16.080> this<00:01:16.290> is<00:01:16.350> the<00:01:16.680> infrared<00:01:17.430> thermometer

00:01:18.200 --> 00:01:18.210 
this this is the infrared thermometer

00:01:18.210 --> 00:01:20.539 
this this is the infrared thermometer
and<00:01:18.330> I<00:01:18.420> can<00:01:18.630> measure<00:01:18.900> various<00:01:19.860> things<00:01:20.340> with

00:01:20.539 --> 00:01:20.549 
and I can measure various things with

00:01:20.549 --> 00:01:22.580 
and I can measure various things with
this<00:01:20.729> such<00:01:21.479> as<00:01:21.720> my<00:01:21.990> hand

00:01:22.580 --> 00:01:22.590 
this such as my hand

00:01:22.590 --> 00:01:24.950 
this such as my hand
so<00:01:22.920> shall<00:01:23.159> we<00:01:23.189> measure<00:01:23.490> my<00:01:23.729> hand<00:01:24.060> so<00:01:24.780> let's

00:01:24.950 --> 00:01:24.960 
so shall we measure my hand so let's

00:01:24.960 --> 00:01:27.410 
so shall we measure my hand so let's
pull<00:01:25.170> the<00:01:25.320> trigger<00:01:25.350> and<00:01:25.799> we<00:01:26.549> can<00:01:26.759> see<00:01:27.000> on<00:01:27.270> the

00:01:27.410 --> 00:01:27.420 
pull the trigger and we can see on the

00:01:27.420 --> 00:01:31.850 
pull the trigger and we can see on the
display<00:01:27.540> here<00:01:28.700> 28<00:01:29.700> degrees<00:01:30.630> centigrade<00:01:31.619> so

00:01:31.850 --> 00:01:31.860 
display here 28 degrees centigrade so

00:01:31.860 --> 00:01:34.460 
display here 28 degrees centigrade so
that's<00:01:32.340> what<00:01:32.520> it's<00:01:32.640> measuring<00:01:33.180> my<00:01:33.750> sore<00:01:34.049> hand

00:01:34.460 --> 00:01:34.470 
that's what it's measuring my sore hand

00:01:34.470 --> 00:01:36.530 
that's what it's measuring my sore hand
at<00:01:34.650> temperature<00:01:35.159> and<00:01:35.579> now<00:01:35.939> let's<00:01:36.150> just<00:01:36.240> take

00:01:36.530 --> 00:01:36.540 
at temperature and now let's just take

00:01:36.540 --> 00:01:38.300 
at temperature and now let's just take
my<00:01:36.659> hand<00:01:36.900> out<00:01:36.990> the<00:01:37.110> way<00:01:37.229> and<00:01:37.439> we<00:01:37.860> measure<00:01:38.159> at

00:01:38.300 --> 00:01:38.310 
my hand out the way and we measure at

00:01:38.310 --> 00:01:40.580 
my hand out the way and we measure at
the<00:01:38.400> wall<00:01:38.610> in<00:01:38.909> the<00:01:39.090> distance<00:01:39.509> which<00:01:40.140> is<00:01:40.350> coming

00:01:40.580 --> 00:01:40.590 
the wall in the distance which is coming

00:01:40.590 --> 00:01:44.149 
the wall in the distance which is coming
in<00:01:40.770> at<00:01:41.009> nineteen<00:01:41.939> point<00:01:42.509> seven<00:01:43.110> degrees<00:01:43.500> or

00:01:44.149 --> 00:01:44.159 
in at nineteen point seven degrees or

00:01:44.159 --> 00:01:46.249 
in at nineteen point seven degrees or
nineteen<00:01:44.520> point<00:01:44.759> six<00:01:44.930> and<00:01:45.930> then<00:01:46.140> we're<00:01:46.229> just

00:01:46.249 --> 00:01:46.259 
nineteen point six and then we're just

00:01:46.259 --> 00:01:48.950 
nineteen point six and then we're just
going<00:01:46.500> to<00:01:46.560> move<00:01:46.799> the<00:01:47.130> red<00:01:47.460> dot<00:01:47.729> down<00:01:48.000> into<00:01:48.840> the

00:01:48.950 --> 00:01:48.960 
going to move the red dot down into the

00:01:48.960 --> 00:01:51.230 
going to move the red dot down into the
center<00:01:49.350> of<00:01:49.409> the<00:01:49.530> case<00:01:49.770> of<00:01:50.130> the<00:01:50.759> Mac<00:01:50.939> Pro<00:01:51.180> you

00:01:51.230 --> 00:01:51.240 
center of the case of the Mac Pro you

00:01:51.240 --> 00:01:53.450 
center of the case of the Mac Pro you
can<00:01:51.479> see<00:01:51.689> just<00:01:51.960> there<00:01:52.229> it's<00:01:52.649> on<00:01:52.829> the<00:01:52.979> back<00:01:53.159> pro

00:01:53.450 --> 00:01:53.460 
can see just there it's on the back pro

00:01:53.460 --> 00:01:57.469 
can see just there it's on the back pro
and<00:01:53.820> it's<00:01:54.240> measuring<00:01:55.009> 27<00:01:56.009> point<00:01:56.790> three

00:01:57.469 --> 00:01:57.479 
and it's measuring 27 point three

00:01:57.479 --> 00:02:01.010 
and it's measuring 27 point three
degrees<00:01:58.229> so<00:01:59.159> not<00:01:59.700> too<00:01:59.939> much<00:02:00.149> different<00:02:00.570> it's<00:02:00.930> a

00:02:01.010 --> 00:02:01.020 
degrees so not too much different it's a

00:02:01.020 --> 00:02:03.230 
degrees so not too much different it's a
little<00:02:01.350> bit<00:02:01.469> warm<00:02:01.680> and<00:02:01.860> if<00:02:02.640> I<00:02:02.759> just<00:02:02.909> turn<00:02:03.119> this

00:02:03.230 --> 00:02:03.240 
little bit warm and if I just turn this

00:02:03.240 --> 00:02:03.980 
little bit warm and if I just turn this
off<00:02:03.360> for<00:02:03.420> a<00:02:03.600> while

00:02:03.980 --> 00:02:03.990 
off for a while

00:02:03.990 --> 00:02:05.389 
off for a while
I<00:02:04.020> mean<00:02:04.170> it's<00:02:04.290> all<00:02:04.380> well<00:02:04.740> and<00:02:04.860> good<00:02:04.920> taking

00:02:05.389 --> 00:02:05.399 
I mean it's all well and good taking

00:02:05.399 --> 00:02:07.490 
I mean it's all well and good taking
measurements<00:02:05.670> but<00:02:06.390> when<00:02:06.540> I<00:02:06.659> touch<00:02:06.930> the<00:02:07.140> actual

00:02:07.490 --> 00:02:07.500 
measurements but when I touch the actual

00:02:07.500 --> 00:02:08.419 
measurements but when I touch the actual
case<00:02:07.710> into<00:02:08.039> this

00:02:08.419 --> 00:02:08.429 
case into this

00:02:08.429 --> 00:02:10.940 
case into this
it's<00:02:08.910> just<00:02:09.209> lukewarm<00:02:09.509> there's<00:02:10.259> hardly<00:02:10.590> any

00:02:10.940 --> 00:02:10.950 
it's just lukewarm there's hardly any

00:02:10.950 --> 00:02:11.550 
it's just lukewarm there's hardly any
heat<00:02:11.220> coming

00:02:11.550 --> 00:02:11.560 
heat coming

00:02:11.560 --> 00:02:13.680 
heat coming
this<00:02:11.830> at<00:02:11.980> all<00:02:12.160> so<00:02:13.090> I'm<00:02:13.150> gonna<00:02:13.209> leave<00:02:13.450> this

00:02:13.680 --> 00:02:13.690 
this at all so I'm gonna leave this

00:02:13.690 --> 00:02:15.960 
this at all so I'm gonna leave this
running<00:02:14.020> for<00:02:14.410> a<00:02:14.440> little<00:02:14.650> while<00:02:14.860> and<00:02:15.130> actually

00:02:15.960 --> 00:02:15.970 
running for a little while and actually

00:02:15.970 --> 00:02:17.610 
running for a little while and actually
just<00:02:16.180> let<00:02:16.420> it<00:02:16.510> warm<00:02:16.840> up<00:02:17.020> a<00:02:17.140> bit<00:02:17.290> as<00:02:17.470> its

00:02:17.610 --> 00:02:17.620 
just let it warm up a bit as its

00:02:17.620 --> 00:02:19.770 
just let it warm up a bit as its
processing<00:02:18.130> these<00:02:18.400> files<00:02:18.760> and<00:02:19.060> then<00:02:19.480> we<00:02:19.600> take

00:02:19.770 --> 00:02:19.780 
processing these files and then we take

00:02:19.780 --> 00:02:22.199 
processing these files and then we take
some<00:02:19.840> further<00:02:20.319> measurements<00:02:20.740> so<00:02:21.550> we<00:02:21.730> are<00:02:21.910> back

00:02:22.199 --> 00:02:22.209 
some further measurements so we are back

00:02:22.209 --> 00:02:24.360 
some further measurements so we are back
and<00:02:22.510> this<00:02:22.870> has<00:02:23.170> been<00:02:23.500> running<00:02:23.860> for<00:02:23.890> around

00:02:24.360 --> 00:02:24.370 
and this has been running for around

00:02:24.370 --> 00:02:26.370 
and this has been running for around
about<00:02:24.550> an<00:02:24.760> additional<00:02:24.970> ten<00:02:25.540> to<00:02:25.930> fifteen

00:02:26.370 --> 00:02:26.380 
about an additional ten to fifteen

00:02:26.380 --> 00:02:28.170 
about an additional ten to fifteen
minutes<00:02:26.830> we've<00:02:27.400> still<00:02:27.610> got<00:02:27.730> some<00:02:27.760> videos

00:02:28.170 --> 00:02:28.180 
minutes we've still got some videos

00:02:28.180 --> 00:02:30.330 
minutes we've still got some videos
playing<00:02:28.510> back<00:02:28.780> and<00:02:29.020> we're<00:02:29.680> going<00:02:29.800> to<00:02:29.830> do<00:02:30.010> some

00:02:30.330 --> 00:02:30.340 
playing back and we're going to do some

00:02:30.340 --> 00:02:32.190 
playing back and we're going to do some
more<00:02:30.640> measurements<00:02:30.790> so<00:02:31.660> this<00:02:31.840> time<00:02:32.050> around

00:02:32.190 --> 00:02:32.200 
more measurements so this time around

00:02:32.200 --> 00:02:34.020 
more measurements so this time around
I'm<00:02:32.380> going<00:02:32.500> to<00:02:32.560> measure<00:02:32.739> the<00:02:33.010> external<00:02:33.640> case

00:02:34.020 --> 00:02:34.030 
I'm going to measure the external case

00:02:34.030 --> 00:02:35.729 
I'm going to measure the external case
again<00:02:34.360> and<00:02:34.480> also<00:02:34.930> do<00:02:35.230> a<00:02:35.260> temperature

00:02:35.729 --> 00:02:35.739 
again and also do a temperature

00:02:35.739 --> 00:02:37.740 
again and also do a temperature
measurement<00:02:35.890> on<00:02:36.310> the<00:02:36.459> top<00:02:36.700> area<00:02:37.090> which<00:02:37.600> is

00:02:37.740 --> 00:02:37.750 
measurement on the top area which is

00:02:37.750 --> 00:02:39.780 
measurement on the top area which is
where<00:02:37.900> all<00:02:37.930> the<00:02:38.140> heats<00:02:38.350> dissipated<00:02:39.069> first<00:02:39.670> of

00:02:39.780 --> 00:02:39.790 
where all the heats dissipated first of

00:02:39.790 --> 00:02:41.790 
where all the heats dissipated first of
all<00:02:39.850> let's<00:02:40.060> just<00:02:40.120> take<00:02:40.420> a<00:02:40.660> measurement<00:02:41.050> of<00:02:41.260> my

00:02:41.790 --> 00:02:41.800 
all let's just take a measurement of my

00:02:41.800 --> 00:02:44.729 
all let's just take a measurement of my
hand<00:02:42.190> just<00:02:42.670> so<00:02:42.819> that<00:02:42.970> we<00:02:43.090> get<00:02:43.300> a<00:02:43.930> nice<00:02:44.440> sort<00:02:44.709> of

00:02:44.729 --> 00:02:44.739 
hand just so that we get a nice sort of

00:02:44.739 --> 00:02:48.600 
hand just so that we get a nice sort of
figure<00:02:45.400> to<00:02:45.850> reference<00:02:46.750> it<00:02:46.959> to<00:02:47.160> now<00:02:48.160> we're

00:02:48.600 --> 00:02:48.610 
figure to reference it to now we're

00:02:48.610 --> 00:02:53.250 
figure to reference it to now we're
coming<00:02:48.910> in<00:02:49.030> at<00:02:49.260> 29<00:02:50.260> or<00:02:50.590> 30<00:02:50.620> point<00:02:51.310> two<00:02:51.760> or<00:02:52.260> yeah

00:02:53.250 --> 00:02:53.260 
coming in at 29 or 30 point two or yeah

00:02:53.260 --> 00:02:55.620 
coming in at 29 or 30 point two or yeah
let's<00:02:53.500> call<00:02:53.680> it<00:02:53.830> sort<00:02:54.070> of<00:02:54.100> twenty<00:02:54.550> nine<00:02:54.630> point

00:02:55.620 --> 00:02:55.630 
let's call it sort of twenty nine point

00:02:55.630 --> 00:02:58.949 
let's call it sort of twenty nine point
eight<00:02:56.110> degrees<00:02:56.470> centigrade<00:02:57.430> on<00:02:57.700> my<00:02:58.030> hand<00:02:58.330> and

00:02:58.949 --> 00:02:58.959 
eight degrees centigrade on my hand and

00:02:58.959 --> 00:03:00.479 
eight degrees centigrade on my hand and
now<00:02:59.080> let's<00:02:59.260> just<00:02:59.500> move<00:02:59.680> my<00:02:59.830> hand<00:03:00.069> out<00:03:00.220> the<00:03:00.340> way

00:03:00.479 --> 00:03:00.489 
now let's just move my hand out the way

00:03:00.489 --> 00:03:03.150 
now let's just move my hand out the way
and<00:03:00.730> we<00:03:01.360> go<00:03:01.510> down<00:03:01.780> onto<00:03:02.110> the<00:03:02.200> Mac<00:03:02.380> Pro<00:03:02.680> so<00:03:03.069> the

00:03:03.150 --> 00:03:03.160 
and we go down onto the Mac Pro so the

00:03:03.160 --> 00:03:05.220 
and we go down onto the Mac Pro so the
red<00:03:03.340> dot<00:03:03.519> is<00:03:03.640> on<00:03:03.760> the<00:03:03.850> Mac<00:03:04.000> Pro<00:03:04.269> nail<00:03:04.510> and<00:03:04.720> we're

00:03:05.220 --> 00:03:05.230 
red dot is on the Mac Pro nail and we're

00:03:05.230 --> 00:03:09.030 
red dot is on the Mac Pro nail and we're
coming<00:03:05.500> in<00:03:05.590> at<00:03:05.709> twenty<00:03:06.660> eight<00:03:07.660> point<00:03:08.319> six

00:03:09.030 --> 00:03:09.040 
coming in at twenty eight point six

00:03:09.040 --> 00:03:11.280 
coming in at twenty eight point six
let's<00:03:10.030> move<00:03:10.239> it<00:03:10.360> a<00:03:10.390> little<00:03:10.569> tiny<00:03:10.870> bit<00:03:11.050> closer

00:03:11.280 --> 00:03:11.290 
let's move it a little tiny bit closer

00:03:11.290 --> 00:03:12.870 
let's move it a little tiny bit closer
just<00:03:11.769> in<00:03:11.890> case<00:03:12.069> that's<00:03:12.250> not<00:03:12.370> entirely

00:03:12.870 --> 00:03:12.880 
just in case that's not entirely

00:03:12.880 --> 00:03:15.750 
just in case that's not entirely
accurate<00:03:13.180> and<00:03:13.900> it's<00:03:14.620> gone<00:03:14.769> up<00:03:14.860> a<00:03:14.950> tiny<00:03:15.220> bit<00:03:15.370> so

00:03:15.750 --> 00:03:15.760 
accurate and it's gone up a tiny bit so

00:03:15.760 --> 00:03:18.600 
accurate and it's gone up a tiny bit so
twenty<00:03:16.390> nine<00:03:16.660> point<00:03:17.500> two<00:03:17.650> that's<00:03:18.100> peeking<00:03:18.519> out

00:03:18.600 --> 00:03:18.610 
twenty nine point two that's peeking out

00:03:18.610 --> 00:03:20.160 
twenty nine point two that's peeking out
and<00:03:18.790> now<00:03:19.360> we<00:03:19.420> just<00:03:19.720> want<00:03:19.930> to<00:03:19.989> take<00:03:20.140> a

00:03:20.160 --> 00:03:20.170 
and now we just want to take a

00:03:20.170 --> 00:03:22.680 
and now we just want to take a
measurement<00:03:20.470> on<00:03:20.860> the<00:03:21.579> top<00:03:21.790> area<00:03:22.180> here<00:03:22.239> so

00:03:22.680 --> 00:03:22.690 
measurement on the top area here so

00:03:22.690 --> 00:03:24.840 
measurement on the top area here so
before<00:03:23.350> we<00:03:23.470> measure<00:03:23.680> the<00:03:23.890> top<00:03:24.040> area<00:03:24.400> of<00:03:24.519> the

00:03:24.840 --> 00:03:24.850 
before we measure the top area of the

00:03:24.850 --> 00:03:26.100 
before we measure the top area of the
Mac<00:03:25.000> Pro<00:03:25.180> let's<00:03:25.360> just<00:03:25.570> take<00:03:25.720> a<00:03:25.750> measurement

00:03:26.100 --> 00:03:26.110 
Mac Pro let's just take a measurement

00:03:26.110 --> 00:03:28.380 
Mac Pro let's just take a measurement
off<00:03:26.380> the<00:03:26.620> wall<00:03:26.799> so<00:03:27.120> we're<00:03:28.120> getting<00:03:28.239> a

00:03:28.380 --> 00:03:28.390 
off the wall so we're getting a

00:03:28.390 --> 00:03:32.970 
off the wall so we're getting a
measurement<00:03:28.690> of<00:03:30.720> 20.6<00:03:31.720> 20<00:03:32.200> point<00:03:32.380> seven<00:03:32.829> on

00:03:32.970 --> 00:03:32.980 
measurement of 20.6 20 point seven on

00:03:32.980 --> 00:03:34.920 
measurement of 20.6 20 point seven on
the<00:03:33.100> wall<00:03:33.280> and<00:03:33.880> now<00:03:33.970> let's<00:03:34.120> just<00:03:34.329> move<00:03:34.510> down<00:03:34.750> to

00:03:34.920 --> 00:03:34.930 
the wall and now let's just move down to

00:03:34.930 --> 00:03:37.319 
the wall and now let's just move down to
the<00:03:35.049> Mac<00:03:35.200> Pro<00:03:35.530> you<00:03:36.220> can<00:03:36.340> see<00:03:36.489> the<00:03:36.640> red<00:03:36.850> dot<00:03:37.120> in

00:03:37.319 --> 00:03:37.329 
the Mac Pro you can see the red dot in

00:03:37.329 --> 00:03:39.840 
the Mac Pro you can see the red dot in
the<00:03:37.600> center<00:03:38.019> area<00:03:38.200> there<00:03:38.769> on<00:03:38.950> the<00:03:39.220> Mac<00:03:39.370> Pro<00:03:39.610> and

00:03:39.840 --> 00:03:39.850 
the center area there on the Mac Pro and

00:03:39.850 --> 00:03:43.890 
the center area there on the Mac Pro and
we're<00:03:40.420> getting<00:03:40.480> a<00:03:40.690> reading<00:03:40.930> of<00:03:41.970> 35<00:03:42.970> degrees

00:03:43.890 --> 00:03:43.900 
we're getting a reading of 35 degrees

00:03:43.900 --> 00:03:45.630 
we're getting a reading of 35 degrees
peeking<00:03:44.530> at<00:03:44.620> around<00:03:44.769> about<00:03:44.980> thirty<00:03:45.310> five

00:03:45.630 --> 00:03:45.640 
peeking at around about thirty five
