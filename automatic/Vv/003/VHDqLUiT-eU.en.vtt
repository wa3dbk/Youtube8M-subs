select the field you'd like to change
let's<00:02:24.430> change<00:02:24.520> lap<00:02:25.150> speed<00:02:25.630> in<00:02:25.810> the<00:02:25.900> top<00:02:26.140> left

00:02:26.430 --> 00:02:26.440 
let's change lap speed in the top left

00:02:26.440 --> 00:02:29.160 
let's change lap speed in the top left
corner<00:02:26.800> and<00:02:27.210> then<00:02:28.210> we<00:02:28.360> have<00:02:28.570> a<00:02:28.600> bunch<00:02:28.960> of

00:02:29.160 --> 00:02:29.170 
corner and then we have a bunch of

00:02:29.170 --> 00:02:31.190 
corner and then we have a bunch of
categories<00:02:29.980> within<00:02:30.640> these<00:02:30.820> categories

00:02:31.190 --> 00:02:31.200 
categories within these categories

00:02:31.200 --> 00:02:34.350 
categories within these categories
there's<00:02:32.200> different<00:02:32.770> options<00:02:33.340> so<00:02:33.970> if<00:02:34.090> I<00:02:34.180> go

00:02:34.350 --> 00:02:34.360 
there's different options so if I go

00:02:34.360 --> 00:02:39.180 
there's different options so if I go
into<00:02:34.510> cadence<00:02:35.200> I<00:02:35.560> have<00:02:36.900> average<00:02:37.900> cadence<00:02:38.800> lap

00:02:39.180 --> 00:02:39.190 
into cadence I have average cadence lap

00:02:39.190 --> 00:02:42.240 
into cadence I have average cadence lap
and<00:02:39.610> then<00:02:39.820> just<00:02:40.090> start<00:02:40.360> current<00:02:41.080> cadence<00:02:41.560> and

00:02:42.240 --> 00:02:42.250 
and then just start current cadence and

00:02:42.250 --> 00:02:45.330 
and then just start current cadence and
then<00:02:43.000> we've<00:02:43.120> got<00:02:43.360> calories<00:02:44.080> and<00:02:44.380> the<00:02:45.130> list

00:02:45.330 --> 00:02:45.340 
then we've got calories and the list

00:02:45.340 --> 00:02:46.800 
then we've got calories and the list
goes<00:02:45.550> on<00:02:45.760> so<00:02:45.970> I'm<00:02:46.090> just<00:02:46.210> going<00:02:46.330> to<00:02:46.450> quickly

00:02:46.800 --> 00:02:46.810 
goes on so I'm just going to quickly

00:02:46.810 --> 00:02:48.690 
goes on so I'm just going to quickly
just<00:02:47.020> jump<00:02:47.800> into<00:02:47.950> each<00:02:48.220> one<00:02:48.520> of<00:02:48.610> these

00:02:48.690 --> 00:02:48.700 
just jump into each one of these

00:02:48.700 --> 00:02:50.790 
just jump into each one of these
categories<00:02:49.450> so<00:02:50.020> you<00:02:50.050> can<00:02:50.230> see<00:02:50.410> some<00:02:50.650> of<00:02:50.680> the

00:02:50.790 --> 00:02:50.800 
categories so you can see some of the

00:02:50.800 --> 00:03:00.030 
categories so you can see some of the
options<00:02:51.190> available<00:02:58.410> if<00:02:59.410> I'm<00:02:59.650> going<00:02:59.920> a<00:03:00.010> little

00:03:00.030 --> 00:03:00.040 
options available if I'm going a little

00:03:00.040 --> 00:04:12.030 
options available if I'm going a little
too<00:03:00.250> fast<00:03:00.990> feel<00:03:01.990> free<00:03:02.230> to<00:03:02.260> pause<00:03:02.530> the<00:03:02.830> video

00:04:12.030 --> 00:04:12.040 

00:04:12.040 --> 00:04:15.390 

so<00:04:12.790> now<00:04:12.970> let's<00:04:13.299> choose<00:04:13.720> a<00:04:14.170> data<00:04:14.709> field<00:04:15.069> to<00:04:15.280> add

00:04:15.390 --> 00:04:15.400 
so now let's choose a data field to add

00:04:15.400 --> 00:04:17.640 
so now let's choose a data field to add
to<00:04:15.640> that<00:04:15.670> top<00:04:16.030> corner<00:04:16.389> so<00:04:17.019> I'm<00:04:17.109> going<00:04:17.229> to<00:04:17.260> grab

00:04:17.640 --> 00:04:17.650 
to that top corner so I'm going to grab

00:04:17.650 --> 00:04:20.490 
to that top corner so I'm going to grab
something<00:04:18.010> from<00:04:18.070> general<00:04:18.790> and<00:04:19.060> we'll<00:04:19.479> do<00:04:19.690> GPS

00:04:20.490 --> 00:04:20.500 
something from general and we'll do GPS

00:04:20.500 --> 00:04:23.820 
something from general and we'll do GPS
signal<00:04:21.100> strength<00:04:21.669> and<00:04:22.139> now<00:04:23.139> you<00:04:23.199> can<00:04:23.500> see<00:04:23.710> up

00:04:23.820 --> 00:04:23.830 
signal strength and now you can see up

00:04:23.830 --> 00:04:26.460 
signal strength and now you can see up
here<00:04:23.860> it<00:04:24.430> changed<00:04:25.389> now<00:04:25.570> we<00:04:25.630> have<00:04:25.900> the<00:04:26.110> signal

00:04:26.460 --> 00:04:26.470 
here it changed now we have the signal

00:04:26.470 --> 00:04:30.180 
here it changed now we have the signal
strength<00:04:26.830> bar<00:04:28.229> and<00:04:29.229> you<00:04:29.650> could<00:04:29.800> go<00:04:29.949> through

00:04:30.180 --> 00:04:30.190 
strength bar and you could go through

00:04:30.190 --> 00:04:33.029 
strength bar and you could go through
the<00:04:30.280> different<00:04:30.940> screens<00:04:31.510> and<00:04:31.930> edit<00:04:32.289> them<00:04:32.560> so

00:04:33.029 --> 00:04:33.039 
the different screens and edit them so

00:04:33.039 --> 00:04:35.250 
the different screens and edit them so
it<00:04:33.400> shows<00:04:33.610> the<00:04:33.639> information<00:04:34.449> you<00:04:34.690> need<00:04:34.930> to

00:04:35.250 --> 00:04:35.260 
it shows the information you need to

00:04:35.260 --> 00:04:38.279 
it shows the information you need to
train<00:04:35.590> better<00:04:36.240> that<00:04:37.240> was<00:04:37.419> a<00:04:37.449> quick<00:04:37.690> look<00:04:37.750> at

00:04:38.279 --> 00:04:38.289 
train better that was a quick look at

00:04:38.289 --> 00:04:40.830 
train better that was a quick look at
changing<00:04:38.919> the<00:04:38.949> training<00:04:39.430> pages<00:04:39.940> or<00:04:40.449> data

00:04:40.830 --> 00:04:40.840
