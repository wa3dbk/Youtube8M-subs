there in this particular case it's not
playing<00:01:56.260> so<00:01:56.710> it<00:01:56.920> doesn't<00:01:57.550> support<00:01:57.880> flash<00:01:59.070> the

00:02:01.520 --> 00:02:01.530 
playing so it doesn't support flash the

00:02:01.530 --> 00:02:04.860 
playing so it doesn't support flash the
the<00:02:02.530> market<00:02:02.980> does<00:02:03.220> offer<00:02:03.580> flash<00:02:04.540> to<00:02:04.750> be

00:02:04.860 --> 00:02:04.870 
the market does offer flash to be

00:02:04.870 --> 00:02:07.860 
the market does offer flash to be
downloaded<00:02:05.490> but<00:02:06.490> when<00:02:07.120> you<00:02:07.240> try<00:02:07.450> to<00:02:07.480> download

00:02:07.860 --> 00:02:07.870 
downloaded but when you try to download

00:02:07.870 --> 00:02:10.020 
downloaded but when you try to download
it<00:02:08.259> it<00:02:08.770> tells<00:02:08.979> you<00:02:09.100> that<00:02:09.250> it's<00:02:09.429> not<00:02:09.490> supported

00:02:10.020 --> 00:02:10.030

00:02:10.030 --> 00:02:12.300 
it it tells you that it's not supported
by<00:02:10.060> the<00:02:10.179> device<00:02:10.780> so<00:02:11.530> at<00:02:11.680> this<00:02:11.800> time<00:02:11.860> there's<00:02:12.250> no

by the device so at this time there's no

00:02:12.310 --> 00:02:17.490 
by the device so at this time there's no
flash<00:02:12.610> on<00:02:12.790> the<00:02:12.850> phone<00:02:14.580> in<00:02:15.630> reference<00:02:16.630> to<00:02:16.930> video

00:02:17.500 --> 00:02:21.990 
flash on the phone in reference to video
games<00:02:17.830> the<00:02:18.660> phone<00:02:19.660> does<00:02:19.900> quite<00:02:20.260> well<00:02:21.000> playing

00:02:21.990 --> 00:02:22.000 
games the phone does quite well playing

00:02:22.000 --> 00:02:26.840 
games the phone does quite well playing
games<00:02:22.240> for<00:02:23.230> example<00:02:23.650> here<00:02:23.680> need<00:02:24.190> for<00:02:24.400> speed

00:02:26.840 --> 00:02:26.850 

00:02:26.850 --> 00:02:29.490 

the<00:02:27.850> only<00:02:28.090> thing<00:02:28.330> that<00:02:28.480> I<00:02:28.510> do<00:02:28.660> notice<00:02:29.080> is<00:02:29.470> that

00:02:29.490 --> 00:02:29.500 
the only thing that I do notice is that

00:02:29.500 --> 00:02:32.940 
the only thing that I do notice is that
for<00:02:30.340> games<00:02:30.610> it<00:02:30.760> does<00:02:30.910> take<00:02:31.209> a<00:02:31.420> bit<00:02:31.990> to<00:02:32.050> load<00:02:32.470> but

00:02:32.940 --> 00:02:32.950 
for games it does take a bit to load but

00:02:32.950 --> 00:02:35.370 
for games it does take a bit to load but
once<00:02:33.190> you're<00:02:33.340> playing<00:02:33.730> the<00:02:34.360> game<00:02:34.570> it<00:02:34.840> performs

00:02:35.370 --> 00:02:35.380 
once you're playing the game it performs

00:02:35.380 --> 00:03:08.720 
once you're playing the game it performs
quite<00:02:35.590> well

00:03:08.720 --> 00:03:08.730 

00:03:08.730 --> 00:03:34.709 

so<00:03:09.730> I'll<00:03:09.790> give<00:03:09.940> you<00:03:10.000> guys<00:03:10.150> a<00:03:10.180> little<00:03:10.420> demo<00:03:10.630> here

00:03:34.709 --> 00:03:34.719 

00:03:34.719 --> 00:03:38.080 

and<00:03:35.719> here<00:03:36.109> you<00:03:36.260> see<00:03:36.469> that<00:03:36.620> it<00:03:36.739> does<00:03:36.920> take<00:03:37.189> quite

00:03:38.080 --> 00:03:38.090 
and here you see that it does take quite

00:03:38.090 --> 00:03:47.740 
and here you see that it does take quite
a<00:03:38.209> bit<00:03:38.420> to<00:03:38.569> load<00:03:38.780> up<00:03:46.209> but<00:03:47.209> once<00:03:47.390> you're<00:03:47.569> in<00:03:47.659> the

00:03:47.740 --> 00:03:47.750 
a bit to load up but once you're in the

00:03:47.750 --> 00:03:57.490 
a bit to load up but once you're in the
game<00:03:49.450> plays<00:03:50.450> just<00:03:50.689> fine

00:03:57.490 --> 00:03:57.500 

00:03:57.500 --> 00:04:02.030 

so<00:03:58.500> you<00:03:58.620> can<00:03:58.830> see<00:03:59.010> it's<00:03:59.190> tears<00:04:00.830> there's<00:04:01.830> really

00:04:02.030 --> 00:04:02.040 
so you can see it's tears there's really

00:04:02.040 --> 00:04:12.340 
so you can see it's tears there's really
