about neck sills and trimming and the

controversial do I do it don't I do it

00:00:12.090 --> 00:00:13.160 
controversial do I do it don't I do it
what<00:00:12.210> do<00:00:12.269> I<00:00:12.360> do

00:00:13.160 --> 00:00:13.170 
what do I do

00:00:13.170 --> 00:00:14.990 
what do I do
there's<00:00:13.679> weary<00:00:13.950> it's<00:00:14.309> a<00:00:14.370> very<00:00:14.519> simple<00:00:14.730> process

00:00:14.990 --> 00:00:15.000 
there's weary it's a very simple process

00:00:15.000 --> 00:00:17.120 
there's weary it's a very simple process
it's<00:00:15.540> not<00:00:15.690> hard<00:00:15.990> it's<00:00:16.289> very<00:00:16.500> simple<00:00:16.890> and<00:00:17.010> it's

00:00:17.120 --> 00:00:17.130 
it's not hard it's very simple and it's

00:00:17.130 --> 00:00:19.279 
it's not hard it's very simple and it's
very<00:00:17.190> easy<00:00:17.460> to<00:00:17.670> do<00:00:17.850> but<00:00:18.660> the<00:00:18.720> most<00:00:18.840> important

00:00:19.279 --> 00:00:19.289 
very easy to do but the most important

00:00:19.289 --> 00:00:21.320 
very easy to do but the most important
thing<00:00:19.470> is<00:00:19.590> to<00:00:19.800> decide<00:00:20.220> whether<00:00:20.789> the<00:00:20.880> neck<00:00:21.060> seal

00:00:21.320 --> 00:00:21.330 
thing is to decide whether the neck seal

00:00:21.330 --> 00:00:23.240 
thing is to decide whether the neck seal
needs<00:00:21.539> cutting<00:00:21.810> to<00:00:21.990> start<00:00:22.260> with<00:00:22.470> obviously

00:00:23.240 --> 00:00:23.250 
needs cutting to start with obviously

00:00:23.250 --> 00:00:25.130 
needs cutting to start with obviously
you're<00:00:23.490> thinking<00:00:23.880> about<00:00:24.000> it<00:00:24.300> because<00:00:24.720> it's

00:00:25.130 --> 00:00:25.140 
you're thinking about it because it's

00:00:25.140 --> 00:00:27.769 
you're thinking about it because it's
tight<00:00:25.439> on<00:00:25.590> your<00:00:25.710> neck<00:00:25.920> etc<00:00:26.779> first

00:00:27.769 --> 00:00:27.779 
tight on your neck etc first

00:00:27.779 --> 00:00:29.689 
tight on your neck etc first
recommendation<00:00:28.170> is<00:00:28.740> the<00:00:28.949> most<00:00:29.099> simplest<00:00:29.490> one

00:00:29.689 --> 00:00:29.699 
recommendation is the most simplest one

00:00:29.699 --> 00:00:32.659 
recommendation is the most simplest one
is<00:00:29.820> to<00:00:30.000> stretch<00:00:30.269> it<00:00:30.420> over<00:00:30.480> a<00:00:30.689> 15<00:00:31.109> liter<00:00:31.410> or<00:00:32.250> a<00:00:32.309> 12

00:00:32.659 --> 00:00:32.669 
is to stretch it over a 15 liter or a 12

00:00:32.669 --> 00:00:35.090 
is to stretch it over a 15 liter or a 12
liter<00:00:32.969> cylinder<00:00:33.180> or<00:00:34.110> the<00:00:34.380> wider<00:00:34.590> if<00:00:34.829> you<00:00:34.920> need

00:00:35.090 --> 00:00:35.100 
liter cylinder or the wider if you need

00:00:35.100 --> 00:00:37.700 
liter cylinder or the wider if you need
to<00:00:35.340> and<00:00:35.670> leave<00:00:36.149> it<00:00:36.329> to<00:00:36.510> set<00:00:36.750> for<00:00:37.050> about<00:00:37.320> 48

00:00:37.700 --> 00:00:37.710 
to and leave it to set for about 48

00:00:37.710 --> 00:00:39.889 
to and leave it to set for about 48
hours<00:00:37.890> or<00:00:38.280> even<00:00:38.309> a<00:00:38.610> week<00:00:38.850> to<00:00:39.420> take<00:00:39.600> a<00:00:39.660> little

00:00:39.889 --> 00:00:39.899 
hours or even a week to take a little

00:00:39.899 --> 00:00:41.869 
hours or even a week to take a little
bit<00:00:40.079> of<00:00:40.170> elasticity<00:00:40.770> out<00:00:41.070> of<00:00:41.219> the<00:00:41.399> newness<00:00:41.760> of

00:00:41.869 --> 00:00:41.879 
bit of elasticity out of the newness of

00:00:41.879 --> 00:00:45.170 
bit of elasticity out of the newness of
that<00:00:42.059> neck<00:00:42.930> seal<00:00:43.230> do<00:00:44.129> not<00:00:44.399> cut<00:00:44.730> it<00:00:44.879> at<00:00:45.030> this

00:00:45.170 --> 00:00:45.180 
that neck seal do not cut it at this

00:00:45.180 --> 00:00:48.260 
that neck seal do not cut it at this
point<00:00:45.510> go<00:00:45.960> for<00:00:46.289> a<00:00:46.320> dime<00:00:46.649> and<00:00:47.039> decide<00:00:47.969> whether

00:00:48.260 --> 00:00:48.270 
point go for a dime and decide whether

00:00:48.270 --> 00:00:50.720 
point go for a dime and decide whether
you<00:00:48.390> want<00:00:48.570> to<00:00:48.629> cut<00:00:48.840> it<00:00:49.020> after<00:00:49.350> that<00:00:50.129> as<00:00:50.430> to

00:00:50.720 --> 00:00:50.730 
you want to cut it after that as to

00:00:50.730 --> 00:00:52.939 
you want to cut it after that as to
being<00:00:51.539> still<00:00:51.809> too<00:00:52.020> tight<00:00:52.289> you've<00:00:52.530> taken<00:00:52.710> as

00:00:52.939 --> 00:00:52.949 
being still too tight you've taken as

00:00:52.949 --> 00:00:55.160 
being still too tight you've taken as
much<00:00:53.129> stretch<00:00:53.550> as<00:00:54.180> you<00:00:54.390> possibly<00:00:54.719> can<00:00:54.930> out<00:00:54.989> of

00:00:55.160 --> 00:00:55.170 
much stretch as you possibly can out of

00:00:55.170 --> 00:00:57.830 
much stretch as you possibly can out of
it<00:00:55.410> and<00:00:56.250> that's<00:00:56.430> a<00:00:56.550> very<00:00:56.670> simple<00:00:57.090> process<00:00:57.570> so

00:00:57.830 --> 00:00:57.840 
it and that's a very simple process so

00:00:57.840 --> 00:01:00.799 
it and that's a very simple process so
let's<00:00:58.410> take<00:00:58.590> this<00:00:58.739> off<00:00:58.890> and<00:00:59.129> start<00:00:59.219> afresh<00:00:59.809> if

00:01:00.799 --> 00:01:00.809 
let's take this off and start afresh if

00:01:00.809 --> 00:01:03.110 
let's take this off and start afresh if
we<00:01:00.960> look<00:01:01.109> at<00:01:01.230> the<00:01:01.320> neck<00:01:01.500> seal<00:01:01.800> you'll<00:01:02.730> see<00:01:02.969> from

00:01:03.110 --> 00:01:03.120 
we look at the neck seal you'll see from

00:01:03.120 --> 00:01:05.570 
we look at the neck seal you'll see from
the<00:01:03.270> top<00:01:03.510> ring<00:01:03.809> down<00:01:04.680> to<00:01:04.860> the<00:01:04.979> lower<00:01:05.189> ring<00:01:05.400> it's

00:01:05.570 --> 00:01:05.580 
the top ring down to the lower ring it's

00:01:05.580 --> 00:01:08.000 
the top ring down to the lower ring it's
I<00:01:05.760> will<00:01:05.939> actually<00:01:06.420> add<00:01:06.659> an<00:01:06.810> angle<00:01:07.290> so<00:01:07.830> for

00:01:08.000 --> 00:01:08.010 
I will actually add an angle so for

00:01:08.010 --> 00:01:11.090 
I will actually add an angle so for
every<00:01:08.250> ring<00:01:08.549> you<00:01:08.700> cut<00:01:08.970> off<00:01:09.180> it<00:01:09.840> will<00:01:10.100> get

00:01:11.090 --> 00:01:11.100 
every ring you cut off it will get

00:01:11.100 --> 00:01:13.820 
every ring you cut off it will get
larger<00:01:11.610> and<00:01:11.729> larger<00:01:11.790> and<00:01:12.180> larger<00:01:12.240> but<00:01:12.990> there's

00:01:13.820 --> 00:01:13.830 
larger and larger and larger but there's

00:01:13.830 --> 00:01:15.410 
larger and larger and larger but there's
a<00:01:13.890> point<00:01:14.189> where<00:01:14.369> you<00:01:14.460> can<00:01:14.610> go<00:01:14.760> too<00:01:14.820> large<00:01:15.270> so

00:01:15.410 --> 00:01:15.420 
a point where you can go too large so

00:01:15.420 --> 00:01:17.210 
a point where you can go too large so
don't<00:01:15.840> be<00:01:15.960> too<00:01:16.110> ambitious<00:01:16.259> with<00:01:16.799> this<00:01:16.920> so<00:01:17.100> what

00:01:17.210 --> 00:01:17.220 
don't be too ambitious with this so what

00:01:17.220 --> 00:01:19.190 
don't be too ambitious with this so what
we<00:01:17.340> need<00:01:17.490> to<00:01:17.520> do<00:01:17.700> is<00:01:18.360> turn<00:01:18.630> the<00:01:18.810> neck<00:01:18.960> cell

00:01:19.190 --> 00:01:19.200 
we need to do is turn the neck cell

00:01:19.200 --> 00:01:22.460 
we need to do is turn the neck cell
inside<00:01:19.530> out<00:01:19.799> on<00:01:19.979> the<00:01:20.430> suit<00:01:21.200> stretch<00:01:22.200> it<00:01:22.350> over

00:01:22.460 --> 00:01:22.470 
inside out on the suit stretch it over

00:01:22.470 --> 00:01:26.300 
inside out on the suit stretch it over
the<00:01:22.710> actual<00:01:22.830> cylinder<00:01:24.799> unless<00:01:25.799> you<00:01:25.950> can<00:01:26.130> see

00:01:26.300 --> 00:01:26.310 
the actual cylinder unless you can see

00:01:26.310 --> 00:01:30.620 
the actual cylinder unless you can see
now<00:01:26.520> we<00:01:27.420> have<00:01:27.450> rings<00:01:28.520> those<00:01:29.520> rings<00:01:29.939> represent

00:01:30.620 --> 00:01:30.630 
now we have rings those rings represent

00:01:30.630 --> 00:01:35.149 
now we have rings those rings represent
a<00:01:30.840> size<00:01:31.110> change<00:01:32.750> now<00:01:33.750> the<00:01:34.439> most<00:01:34.619> important

00:01:35.149 --> 00:01:35.159 
a size change now the most important

00:01:35.159 --> 00:01:37.460 
a size change now the most important
thing<00:01:35.430> is<00:01:35.729> not<00:01:36.240> to<00:01:36.450> try<00:01:36.689> and<00:01:36.750> do<00:01:37.020> this<00:01:37.200> with<00:01:37.409> a

00:01:37.460 --> 00:01:37.470 
thing is not to try and do this with a

00:01:37.470 --> 00:01:40.219 
thing is not to try and do this with a
pair<00:01:37.740> of<00:01:37.770> scissors<00:01:38.329> because<00:01:39.329> you<00:01:39.509> can't<00:01:39.840> keep

00:01:40.219 --> 00:01:40.229 
pair of scissors because you can't keep

00:01:40.229 --> 00:01:42.380 
pair of scissors because you can't keep
a<00:01:40.439> straight<00:01:40.740> line<00:01:41.040> if<00:01:41.820> you<00:01:42.000> do<00:01:42.150> it<00:01:42.240> with<00:01:42.329> a

00:01:42.380 --> 00:01:42.390 
a straight line if you do it with a

00:01:42.390 --> 00:01:43.999 
a straight line if you do it with a
scissors<00:01:42.750> you<00:01:42.899> may<00:01:43.079> end<00:01:43.290> up<00:01:43.409> just<00:01:43.680> putting<00:01:43.890> a

00:01:43.999 --> 00:01:44.009 
scissors you may end up just putting a

00:01:44.009 --> 00:01:46.219 
scissors you may end up just putting a
little<00:01:44.040> nick<00:01:44.549> here<00:01:44.970> and<00:01:45.780> when<00:01:45.930> you<00:01:46.049> go<00:01:46.200> to

00:01:46.219 --> 00:01:46.229 
little nick here and when you go to

00:01:46.229 --> 00:01:48.170 
little nick here and when you go to
stretch<00:01:46.590> the<00:01:46.770> neck<00:01:46.920> seal<00:01:47.250> that<00:01:47.790> nick

00:01:48.170 --> 00:01:48.180 
stretch the neck seal that nick

00:01:48.180 --> 00:01:50.990 
stretch the neck seal that nick
encourages<00:01:48.930> it<00:01:49.079> to<00:01:49.290> rip<00:01:49.530> hence<00:01:50.340> you're<00:01:50.880> not
