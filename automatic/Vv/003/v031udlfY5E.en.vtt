what do you do we need like an actual

00:00:14.160 --> 00:00:17.210 
what do you do we need like an actual
app<00:00:14.389> how<00:00:15.389> do<00:00:15.450> you<00:00:15.630> manage<00:00:16.289> that<00:00:16.680> I<00:00:16.710> mean<00:00:16.890> I<00:00:17.039> do

00:00:17.210 --> 00:00:17.220 
app how do you manage that I mean I do

podcast<00:00:17.880> I<00:00:18.060> do<00:00:18.119> videos<00:00:18.600> obviously<00:00:18.840> and<00:00:19.410> I

00:00:19.849 --> 00:00:19.859 
podcast I do videos obviously and I

00:00:19.859 --> 00:00:21.140 
podcast I do videos obviously and I
can't<00:00:20.100> really<00:00:20.189> do<00:00:20.430> that<00:00:20.609> with<00:00:20.730> a<00:00:20.760> web<00:00:20.970> app

00:00:21.140 --> 00:00:21.150 
can't really do that with a web app

00:00:21.150 --> 00:00:23.570 
can't really do that with a web app
although<00:00:21.420> I<00:00:21.510> have<00:00:21.869> found<00:00:22.109> a<00:00:22.170> few<00:00:22.430> options<00:00:23.430> out

00:00:23.570 --> 00:00:23.580 
although I have found a few options out

00:00:23.580 --> 00:00:25.160 
although I have found a few options out
there<00:00:23.730> that<00:00:23.760> I'm<00:00:24.000> exploring<00:00:24.630> right<00:00:24.779> now<00:00:24.840> a

00:00:25.160 --> 00:00:25.170 
there that I'm exploring right now a

00:00:25.170 --> 00:00:27.200 
there that I'm exploring right now a
native<00:00:26.070> app<00:00:26.189> though<00:00:26.340> really<00:00:26.699> comes<00:00:26.910> in<00:00:27.029> handy

00:00:27.200 --> 00:00:27.210 
native app though really comes in handy

00:00:27.210 --> 00:00:29.269 
native app though really comes in handy
so<00:00:27.510> how<00:00:27.630> do<00:00:27.689> you<00:00:27.840> do<00:00:27.990> that<00:00:28.199> it<00:00:28.650> turns<00:00:28.920> out<00:00:29.220> that

00:00:29.269 --> 00:00:29.279 
so how do you do that it turns out that

00:00:29.279 --> 00:00:31.040 
so how do you do that it turns out that
with<00:00:29.580> the<00:00:29.699> Chromebook<00:00:29.910> pixel<00:00:30.090> even<00:00:30.779> some<00:00:30.990> of

00:00:31.040 --> 00:00:31.050 
with the Chromebook pixel even some of

00:00:31.050 --> 00:00:32.450 
with the Chromebook pixel even some of
the<00:00:31.109> other<00:00:31.170> Chrome<00:00:31.529> OS<00:00:31.710> devices<00:00:32.250> it's

00:00:32.450 --> 00:00:32.460 
the other Chrome OS devices it's

00:00:32.460 --> 00:00:34.580 
the other Chrome OS devices it's
actually<00:00:33.180> easy<00:00:33.360> to<00:00:33.570> put<00:00:33.750> this<00:00:33.840> into<00:00:34.050> developer

00:00:34.580 --> 00:00:34.590 
actually easy to put this into developer

00:00:34.590 --> 00:00:36.470 
actually easy to put this into developer
mode<00:00:34.770> and<00:00:35.040> run<00:00:35.520> an<00:00:35.670> alternative<00:00:36.180> operating

00:00:36.470 --> 00:00:36.480 
mode and run an alternative operating

00:00:36.480 --> 00:00:39.530 
mode and run an alternative operating
system<00:00:36.989> now<00:00:37.440> what<00:00:37.649> you<00:00:37.739> can<00:00:37.950> do<00:00:38.190> is<00:00:38.450> get<00:00:39.450> an

00:00:39.530 --> 00:00:39.540 
system now what you can do is get an

00:00:39.540 --> 00:00:41.090 
system now what you can do is get an
operating<00:00:39.809> systems<00:00:40.170> such<00:00:40.320> as<00:00:40.350> Linux<00:00:40.800> and<00:00:40.980> run

00:00:41.090 --> 00:00:41.100 
operating systems such as Linux and run

00:00:41.100 --> 00:00:43.430 
operating systems such as Linux and run
an<00:00:41.190> I<00:00:41.370> on<00:00:41.760> a<00:00:41.820> USB<00:00:42.210> key<00:00:42.390> just<00:00:42.809> plug<00:00:43.050> it<00:00:43.140> in<00:00:43.260> here

00:00:43.430 --> 00:00:43.440 
an I on a USB key just plug it in here

00:00:43.440 --> 00:00:45.260 
an I on a USB key just plug it in here
and<00:00:43.530> boot<00:00:43.890> into<00:00:44.070> that<00:00:44.399> but<00:00:44.850> what<00:00:45.030> I've<00:00:45.239> chosen

00:00:45.260 --> 00:00:45.270 
and boot into that but what I've chosen

00:00:45.270 --> 00:00:47.389 
and boot into that but what I've chosen
to<00:00:45.629> do<00:00:45.809> is<00:00:45.960> not<00:00:46.170> do<00:00:46.410> a<00:00:46.440> boot<00:00:46.739> because<00:00:47.250> that

00:00:47.389 --> 00:00:47.399 
to do is not do a boot because that

00:00:47.399 --> 00:00:50.330 
to do is not do a boot because that
makes<00:00:47.579> me<00:00:47.670> choose<00:00:47.969> Chrome<00:00:48.750> OS<00:00:48.930> or<00:00:49.320> Linux<00:00:49.860> what

00:00:50.330 --> 00:00:50.340 
makes me choose Chrome OS or Linux what

00:00:50.340 --> 00:00:52.069 
makes me choose Chrome OS or Linux what
I've<00:00:50.460> done<00:00:50.610> instead<00:00:50.940> is<00:00:51.120> I've<00:00:51.300> used<00:00:51.570> a<00:00:51.719> set<00:00:51.960> of

00:00:52.069 --> 00:00:52.079 
I've done instead is I've used a set of

00:00:52.079 --> 00:00:54.410 
I've done instead is I've used a set of
scripts<00:00:52.440> found<00:00:53.129> or<00:00:53.730> created<00:00:54.090> by<00:00:54.180> some

00:00:54.410 --> 00:00:54.420 
scripts found or created by some

00:00:54.420 --> 00:00:56.990 
scripts found or created by some
Googlers<00:00:54.870> called<00:00:55.410> crouton<00:00:55.949> and<00:00:56.430> what<00:00:56.550> crouton

00:00:56.990 --> 00:00:57.000 
Googlers called crouton and what crouton

00:00:57.000 --> 00:00:58.700 
Googlers called crouton and what crouton
does<00:00:57.239> it's<00:00:57.480> really<00:00:57.750> neat<00:00:57.960> takes<00:00:58.079> about<00:00:58.170> 15

00:00:58.700 --> 00:00:58.710 
does it's really neat takes about 15

does it's really neat takes about 15
minutes<00:00:59.070> to<00:00:59.129> set<00:00:59.340> up<00:00:59.370> but<00:00:59.640> once<00:00:59.820> it's<00:01:00.000> set<00:01:00.149> up

00:01:00.170 --> 00:01:00.180 
minutes to set up but once it's set up

00:01:00.180 --> 00:01:02.240

you're<00:01:00.809> actually<00:01:01.170> able<00:01:01.260> to<00:01:01.500> run<00:01:01.710> Chrome<00:01:02.070> OS

00:01:02.240 --> 00:01:02.250 
you're actually able to run Chrome OS

you're<00:01:05.339> running<00:01:05.549> Chrome<00:01:05.790> OS<00:01:05.909> you<00:01:06.180> can<00:01:06.360> go<00:01:06.600> back

00:01:06.859 --> 00:01:06.869 
you're running Chrome OS you can go back

00:01:06.869 --> 00:01:08.480 
you're running Chrome OS you can go back
and<00:01:07.080> forth<00:01:07.380> between<00:01:07.560> the<00:01:08.040> two<00:01:08.189> different

and forth between the two different

00:01:08.490 --> 00:01:11.240 
and forth between the two different
platforms<00:01:08.790> it's<00:01:09.360> very<00:01:09.930> easy<00:01:10.170> to<00:01:10.380> do<00:01:10.560> and<00:01:10.830> it

platforms it's very easy to do and it

00:01:11.250 --> 00:01:13.310 
platforms it's very easy to do and it
makes<00:01:11.280> this<00:01:11.700> device<00:01:11.970> quite<00:01:12.840> a<00:01:12.869> bit<00:01:13.140> more

00:01:13.310 --> 00:01:13.320 
makes this device quite a bit more

00:01:13.320 --> 00:01:14.960 
makes this device quite a bit more
extensible<00:01:13.979> you<00:01:14.100> can<00:01:14.220> do<00:01:14.280> a<00:01:14.310> lot<00:01:14.580> more<00:01:14.610> with<00:01:14.909> it

00:01:14.960 --> 00:01:14.970 
extensible you can do a lot more with it

00:01:14.970 --> 00:01:16.700 
extensible you can do a lot more with it
because<00:01:15.210> now<00:01:15.390> you've<00:01:15.600> got<00:01:15.630> third-party<00:01:16.560> apps

00:01:16.700 --> 00:01:16.710 
because now you've got third-party apps

00:01:16.710 --> 00:01:18.800 
because now you've got third-party apps
provided<00:01:17.490> you<00:01:17.549> can<00:01:17.670> find<00:01:17.909> Linux<00:01:18.270> alternatives

00:01:18.810 --> 00:01:21.140 
provided you can find Linux alternatives
for<00:01:18.990> what<00:01:19.110> you<00:01:19.229> use<00:01:19.439> on<00:01:19.590> Mac<00:01:20.159> or<00:01:20.189> Windows<00:01:20.369> let's

00:01:21.140 --> 00:01:21.150 
for what you use on Mac or Windows let's

00:01:21.150 --> 00:01:22.280 
for what you use on Mac or Windows let's
take<00:01:21.330> a<00:01:21.360> look<00:01:21.570> I'll<00:01:21.689> show<00:01:21.720> you<00:01:21.930> how<00:01:22.049> it<00:01:22.170> works

00:01:22.280 --> 00:01:22.290 
take a look I'll show you how it works

00:01:22.290 --> 00:01:25.999 
take a look I'll show you how it works
okay<00:01:23.720> so<00:01:24.720> now<00:01:25.080> that<00:01:25.229> we've<00:01:25.320> got<00:01:25.500> the<00:01:25.619> script

00:01:25.999 --> 00:01:26.009 
okay so now that we've got the script

00:01:26.009 --> 00:01:27.830 
okay so now that we've got the script
set<00:01:26.250> up<00:01:26.430> so<00:01:26.580> that<00:01:26.700> we<00:01:26.850> can<00:01:27.000> get<00:01:27.210> into<00:01:27.420> Linux<00:01:27.630> at

00:01:27.830 --> 00:01:27.840 
set up so that we can get into Linux at

00:01:27.840 --> 00:01:30.050 
set up so that we can get into Linux at
the<00:01:27.930> same<00:01:28.140> time<00:01:28.350> of<00:01:28.439> running<00:01:28.680> Chrome<00:01:29.130> OS<00:01:29.369> let

00:07:05.510 --> 00:07:05.520 
you've got a whole option a range of

00:07:05.520 --> 00:07:06.350 
you've got a whole option a range of
options<00:07:05.820> now<00:07:05.940> because<00:07:06.180> you've<00:07:06.270> got

00:07:06.350 --> 00:07:06.360 
options now because you've got

00:07:06.360 --> 00:07:08.240 
options now because you've got
third-party<00:07:06.900> apps<00:07:07.050> on<00:07:07.320> the<00:07:07.830> Chromebook<00:07:08.220> pixel

00:07:08.240 --> 00:07:08.250 
third-party apps on the Chromebook pixel

00:07:08.250 --> 00:07:10.550 
third-party apps on the Chromebook pixel
and<00:07:09.030> the<00:07:09.360> nice<00:07:09.510> thing<00:07:09.540> is<00:07:09.900> you<00:07:10.080> can<00:07:10.380> switch

00:07:10.550 --> 00:07:10.560 
and the nice thing is you can switch

00:07:10.560 --> 00:07:12.080 
and the nice thing is you can switch
back<00:07:10.710> and<00:07:10.890> forth<00:07:11.100> to<00:07:11.310> you<00:07:11.400> Chrome<00:07:11.670> OS<00:07:11.850> and

00:07:12.080 --> 00:07:12.090 
back and forth to you Chrome OS and

00:07:12.090 --> 00:07:14.090 
back and forth to you Chrome OS and
Linux<00:07:12.480> I<00:07:12.660> don't<00:07:13.140> see<00:07:13.290> a<00:07:13.320> major<00:07:13.530> performance

00:07:14.090 --> 00:07:14.100 
Linux I don't see a major performance

00:07:14.100 --> 00:07:17.600 
Linux I don't see a major performance
hit<00:07:14.280> and<00:07:15.080> it's<00:07:16.080> just<00:07:16.530> it's<00:07:16.830> really<00:07:17.040> that<00:07:17.460> easy

00:07:17.600 --> 00:07:17.610 
hit and it's just it's really that easy

00:07:17.610 --> 00:07:19.070 
hit and it's just it's really that easy
once<00:07:17.970> you<00:07:18.000> get<00:07:18.150> this<00:07:18.270> script<00:07:18.510> set<00:07:18.750> up<00:07:18.870> which

once you get this script set up which

00:07:19.080 --> 00:07:21.440 
once you get this script set up which
really<00:07:19.320> doesn't<00:07:19.500> take<00:07:19.680> much<00:07:19.710> time<00:07:20.160> a<00:07:20.450> couple

00:07:21.440 --> 00:07:21.450 
really doesn't take much time a couple

00:07:21.450 --> 00:07:23.510 
really doesn't take much time a couple
commands<00:07:21.810> and<00:07:21.960> boom<00:07:22.230> you're<00:07:22.500> in<00:07:22.650> so<00:07:23.220> there<00:07:23.400> you
