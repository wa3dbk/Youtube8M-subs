00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.449
 Hello everyone, Alex and today I 

00:00:02.129 --> 00:00:06.350
 I would like to show you one cool 

00:00:03.449 --> 00:00:07.529
 a new feature that was added in the update 

00:00:06.350 --> 00:00:09.900
 1.7.2 

00:00:07.529 --> 00:00:11.610
 according to the mind on at quite cool so i 

00:00:09.900 --> 00:00:13.320
 decided to show it you started now what 

00:00:11.610 --> 00:00:24.590
 pumpkin can turn on and off brine 

00:00:13.320 --> 00:00:27.060
 yes yes yes yes it is quite cool 

00:00:24.590 --> 00:00:28.140
 break example you know now diamonds 

00:00:27.060 --> 00:00:29.820
 appear and disappear 

00:00:28.140 --> 00:00:32.219
 that is, now it will be much more 

00:00:29.820 --> 00:00:34.469
 harder it seems to me it is quite cool 

00:00:32.219 --> 00:00:36.630
 putting the question why you didn't know 

00:00:34.469 --> 00:00:39.390
 why I basically did not even know because 

00:00:36.630 --> 00:00:41.010
 that it was all fake really nothing 

00:00:39.390 --> 00:00:42.420
 there hasn't changed yet 

00:00:41.010 --> 00:00:44.160
 pumpkin still can not turn on and 

00:00:42.420 --> 00:00:46.200
 diamond still does not disappear 1 pom 

00:00:44.160 --> 00:00:48.239
 sad offtop and the second paragraph only 

00:00:46.200 --> 00:00:50.129
 better than us what actually happened 

00:00:48.239 --> 00:00:53.100
 now see what really 

00:00:50.129 --> 00:00:54.539
 did this thing happen the thing is that on 

00:00:53.100 --> 00:00:55.530
 really pumpkin in comparison 

00:00:54.539 --> 00:00:57.870
 turn on roadstone 

00:00:55.530 --> 00:01:00.390
 really the fact is 

00:00:57.870 --> 00:01:02.160
 that all these things were all in the lever 

00:01:00.390 --> 00:01:04.170
 who became on the wall behind the wall what have 

00:01:02.160 --> 00:01:06.780
 wire to two command blocks in which 

00:01:04.170 --> 00:01:09.990
 I used just added 

00:01:06.780 --> 00:01:11.369
 set block command she k as you already know 

00:01:09.990 --> 00:01:14.580
 she replaces the blog on the specified 

00:01:11.369 --> 00:01:15.630
 coordinates science on the specified block here 

00:01:14.580 --> 00:01:17.939
 that is actually when included 

00:01:15.630 --> 00:01:19.710
 turned off and the lever is right nothing 

00:01:17.939 --> 00:01:22.020
 makes it not needed at all and all that 

00:01:19.710 --> 00:01:23.939
 what actually has a role is the wire 

00:01:22.020 --> 00:01:25.560
 hid behind the wall hidden here this wall 

00:01:23.939 --> 00:01:29.210
 although I did not know what I was doing, I still 

00:01:25.560 --> 00:01:32.189
 I did not show these two early 

00:01:29.210 --> 00:01:34.350
 monoblock look I turn off the lever 

00:01:32.189 --> 00:01:38.400
 this command block is activated which 

00:01:34.350 --> 00:01:39.320
 here this team and pumpkin is replaced 

00:01:38.400 --> 00:01:41.520
 ordinary pumpkin 

00:01:39.320 --> 00:01:43.110
 including back this 

00:01:41.520 --> 00:01:45.350
 command block which has this one 

00:01:43.110 --> 00:01:50.369
 the command, that is, the coordinates first go 

00:01:45.350 --> 00:01:51.590
 x yz then these blocks you want 

00:01:50.369 --> 00:01:53.790
 proper 

00:01:51.590 --> 00:01:57.240
 put on this on this on this 

00:01:53.790 --> 00:01:57.810
 coordinates and additional data for 

00:01:57.240 --> 00:01:59.850
 of this block 

00:01:57.810 --> 00:02:01.439
 those. so over really 

00:01:59.850 --> 00:02:03.090
 worked and that wire was only needed 

00:02:01.439 --> 00:02:07.720
 for the truth to be thought that this 

00:02:03.090 --> 00:02:09.729
 in fact, added that the same 

00:02:07.720 --> 00:02:11.380
 saw in the cave you ask here I 

00:02:09.729 --> 00:02:14.410
 also played with command blocks when 

00:02:11.380 --> 00:02:15.370
 help to the pasta generator i made i 

00:02:14.410 --> 00:02:17.770
 one command block 

00:02:15.370 --> 00:02:19.390
 clean up very leave you set aside 

00:02:17.770 --> 00:02:23.800
 diamond ore at coordinates 

00:02:19.390 --> 00:02:26.920
 and another block at the same time through through 

00:02:23.800 --> 00:02:27.700
 min in a second like in four 

00:02:26.920 --> 00:02:31.840
 tenths of a second 

00:02:27.700 --> 00:02:35.140
 put a stone here in his place then 

00:02:31.840 --> 00:02:38.080
 he again puts about mazda ore put 

00:02:35.140 --> 00:02:43.120
 stone worth diamond ore worth stone 

00:02:38.080 --> 00:02:47.520
 look here when kinship turns on 

00:02:43.120 --> 00:02:50.410
 leading to more to the right to monoblock 

00:02:47.520 --> 00:02:53.110
 water appears when it goes to the left 

00:02:50.410 --> 00:02:58.330
 command block and replaced by the usual 

00:02:53.110 --> 00:03:00.520
 stone well and finally i would like 

00:02:58.330 --> 00:03:03.160
 show you the diamond factory which 

00:03:00.520 --> 00:03:05.550
 did just for fun and on the table 

00:03:03.160 --> 00:03:07.959
 nothing there is such a super no 

00:03:05.550 --> 00:03:11.560
 just the fact that now it will be possible 

00:03:07.959 --> 00:03:13.360
 do something like that 

00:03:11.560 --> 00:03:15.030
 you are not a book about adobe conveyor on which 

00:03:13.360 --> 00:03:18.370
 diamond ore goes 

00:03:15.030 --> 00:03:19.959
 there is nothing new but thanks for that 

00:03:18.370 --> 00:03:21.610
 looked with you was easier 

00:03:19.959 --> 00:03:23.140
 subscribe to the channel put kohen 

00:03:21.610 --> 00:03:25.330
 put likes put comments 

00:03:23.140 --> 00:03:26.590
 check it out here now check out those two 

00:03:25.330 --> 00:03:29.010
 huge pixel art on which they 

00:03:26.590 --> 00:03:32.820
 did why I do not know what and so on 

00:03:29.010 --> 00:03:32.820
