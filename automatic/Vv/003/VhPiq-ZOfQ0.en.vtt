on<00:00:10.740> the<00:00:11.580> first<00:00:11.820> one<00:00:12.210> would<00:00:13.200> be<00:00:14.870> the<00:00:15.870> well<00:00:16.830> at

00:00:17.420 --> 00:00:17.430 
on the first one would be the well at

00:00:17.430 --> 00:00:21.620 
on the first one would be the well at
razones<00:00:18.060> the<00:00:18.690> fastest<00:00:19.490> but<00:00:20.490> so<00:00:20.730> is<00:00:20.880> the<00:00:21.060> way<00:00:21.270> I

00:00:21.620 --> 00:00:21.630 
razones the fastest but so is the way I

00:00:21.630 --> 00:00:23.750 
razones the fastest but so is the way I
don't<00:00:22.140> know<00:00:22.230> which<00:00:22.410> one's<00:00:22.650> faster<00:00:22.740> they<00:00:23.550> look

00:00:23.750 --> 00:00:23.760 
don't know which one's faster they look

00:00:23.760 --> 00:00:29.359 
don't know which one's faster they look
the<00:00:23.939> same<00:00:23.970> but<00:00:25.760> the<00:00:26.760> actress<00:00:27.480> own<00:00:27.720> is<00:00:28.650> really

00:00:29.359 --> 00:00:29.369 
the same but the actress own is really

00:00:29.369 --> 00:00:33.979 
the same but the actress own is really
quite<00:00:29.910> fast<00:00:30.210> car<00:00:30.920> so<00:00:31.920> I<00:00:31.980> think<00:00:32.130> it's<00:00:32.489> quite<00:00:33.090> it

00:00:33.979 --> 00:00:33.989 
quite fast car so I think it's quite it

00:00:33.989 --> 00:00:35.750 
quite fast car so I think it's quite it
looks<00:00:34.200> quite<00:00:34.440> nice<00:00:34.620> once<00:00:34.950> you've<00:00:35.160> customized

00:00:35.750 --> 00:00:35.760 
looks quite nice once you've customized

00:00:35.760 --> 00:00:40.850 
looks quite nice once you've customized
it<00:00:36.620> but<00:00:38.090> so<00:00:39.090> does<00:00:39.329> more<00:00:39.989> the<00:00:40.140> wait<00:00:40.350> you<00:00:40.620> can't

00:00:40.850 --> 00:00:40.860 
it but so does more the wait you can't

00:00:40.860 --> 00:00:47.540 
it but so does more the wait you can't
customize<00:00:42.469> whoa<00:00:43.469> put<00:00:43.860> yourself<00:00:44.010> in<00:00:44.280> there<00:00:46.550> but

00:00:47.540 --> 00:00:47.550 
customize whoa put yourself in there but

00:00:47.550 --> 00:00:51.319 
customize whoa put yourself in there but
the<00:00:47.700> way--the<00:00:48.079> quite<00:00:49.370> cool<00:00:50.370> as<00:00:50.610> well<00:00:50.850> but<00:00:51.210> you

00:00:51.319 --> 00:00:51.329 
the way--the quite cool as well but you

00:00:51.329 --> 00:00:54.049 
the way--the quite cool as well but you
can't<00:00:51.570> customize<00:00:51.840> that<00:00:52.489> you<00:00:53.489> can't<00:00:53.760> read<00:00:53.940> the

00:00:54.049 --> 00:00:54.059 
can't customize that you can't read the

00:00:54.059 --> 00:00:58.160 
can't customize that you can't read the
glitch<00:00:54.360> but<00:00:54.629> it<00:00:54.719> doesn't<00:00:55.050> do<00:00:55.320> much<00:00:56.809> but<00:00:57.809> this

00:00:58.160 --> 00:00:58.170 
glitch but it doesn't do much but this

00:01:42.530 --> 00:01:42.540 
like you can customize this with the

00:01:42.540 --> 00:01:44.870 
like you can customize this with the
glitch<00:01:42.780> you<00:01:43.170> can<00:01:43.920> make<00:01:44.100> it<00:01:44.310> look<00:01:44.460> like<00:01:44.670> the

00:03:18.849 --> 00:03:27.899 
garage but I think there's one more go
to<00:03:19.620> check<00:03:23.970> its<00:03:24.970> full<00:03:25.389> text<00:03:25.989> journal<00:03:26.699> of<00:03:27.699> them

00:03:27.899 --> 00:03:27.909 
to check its full text journal of them

00:03:27.909 --> 00:03:30.920 
to check its full text journal of them
is<00:03:28.510> the<00:03:28.690> way<00:03:28.840> cost<00:03:29.199> of<00:03:29.530> this<00:03:29.650> one<00:03:29.919> it's<00:03:30.579> another

00:03:30.920 --> 00:03:30.930 
is the way cost of this one it's another

00:03:30.930 --> 00:03:36.569 
is the way cost of this one it's another
really<00:03:31.930> fast<00:03:32.379> car<00:03:34.769> you<00:03:35.769> should<00:03:36.010> you<00:03:36.549> should
