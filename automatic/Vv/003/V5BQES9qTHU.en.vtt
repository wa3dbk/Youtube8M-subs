00:00:09.889 --> 00:00:18.619
 give this gift my fight and quite biba 

00:00:13.259 --> 00:00:18.619
 anviz bio on natural further and gas 

00:00:18.860 --> 00:00:23.030
 although necessary 

00:00:21.030 --> 00:00:23.030
 at 

00:00:31.410 --> 00:00:36.430
 in one of his interviews without a car 

00:00:34.059 --> 00:00:38.410
 they say that among the potentially dangerous 

00:00:36.430 --> 00:00:40.899
 places where action would take place far 

00:00:38.410 --> 00:00:43.690
 cry 4 they even considered Siberia 

00:00:40.899 --> 00:00:45.640
 harsh cold conditions have the opportunity 

00:00:43.690 --> 00:00:47.470
 meet dangerous animals but in the end 

00:00:45.640 --> 00:00:49.540
 it was decided to stop at the Himalayas 

00:00:47.470 --> 00:00:53.579
 go have all the same action only 

00:00:49.540 --> 00:00:55.750
 occurs at a much higher altitude 

00:00:53.579 --> 00:00:57.820
 game history unfolds in 

00:00:55.750 --> 00:00:59.890
 a fictional place called kira 

00:00:57.820 --> 00:01:01.540
 young guy named jack gale 

00:00:59.890 --> 00:01:04.420
 comes there to fulfill the will 

00:01:01.540 --> 00:01:06.310
 dead mother development dust but nothing 

00:01:04.420 --> 00:01:08.409
 fails since the first two 

00:01:06.310 --> 00:01:10.119
 minutes of playing our car with a hero and 

00:01:08.409 --> 00:01:11.979
 other people who turn out to be 

00:01:10.119 --> 00:01:14.500
 rebels attack local people 

00:01:11.979 --> 00:01:16.570
 king pagan mine with whom actually 

00:01:14.500 --> 00:01:20.020
 and fighting these rebels calling themselves 

00:01:16.570 --> 00:01:22.150
 the gold path further goes the standard 

00:01:20.020 --> 00:01:24.400
 the development spirit of far cry 3 and films with 

00:01:22.150 --> 00:01:26.560
 similar badge theme and see hope 

00:01:24.400 --> 00:01:28.750
 rebels and the leader he does not remain 

00:01:26.560 --> 00:01:31.030
 nothing else to start fighting 

00:01:28.750 --> 00:01:33.070
 erasing pagan although it turned out 

00:01:31.030 --> 00:01:34.990
 Alternatively still there and their 

00:01:33.070 --> 00:01:36.820
 several can for example get one 

00:01:34.990 --> 00:01:38.440
 from alternative endings where we are not 

00:01:36.820 --> 00:01:41.020
 we will have to fight the media literally 

00:01:38.440 --> 00:01:42.790
 first 14 minutes of the game and this is not 

00:01:41.020 --> 00:01:47.020
 the only secret ending like 

00:01:42.790 --> 00:01:49.360
 say the developers themselves after 

00:01:47.020 --> 00:01:51.310
 incendiary prologue throw us out 

00:01:49.360 --> 00:01:53.020
 sandbox when looking at which eyes 

00:01:51.310 --> 00:01:55.870
 naturally crawl out of orbit 

00:01:53.020 --> 00:01:57.520
 firstly the game world is stunning beautiful 

00:01:55.870 --> 00:01:59.830
 you can just walk around it 

00:01:57.520 --> 00:02:01.510
 admire the beauty of the mountains of forests and rivers 

00:01:59.830 --> 00:02:03.850
 as in the case of the recent unity 

00:02:01.510 --> 00:02:06.220
 designer yubisoft want to shake hands 

00:02:03.850 --> 00:02:08.799
 this is really a great job in 

00:02:06.220 --> 00:02:11.019
 second sandbox is huge as soon as i 

00:02:08.799 --> 00:02:12.730
 knocked out the first tower but without them 

00:02:11.019 --> 00:02:14.860
 the camera rushed to the ground and beyond 

00:02:12.730 --> 00:02:17.349
 several overflights showed territory 

00:02:14.860 --> 00:02:19.450
 wild square and when i opened the map and 

00:02:17.349 --> 00:02:21.549
 estranged and it was hit on hit her 

00:02:19.450 --> 00:02:24.280
 size not exceeding this 

00:02:21.549 --> 00:02:27.090
 a piece of ten at least 

00:02:24.280 --> 00:02:27.090
 thin water 

00:02:32.010 --> 00:02:36.720
 and here it is a huge territory 

00:02:34.830 --> 00:02:39.390
 tradition is filled with the same huge 

00:02:36.720 --> 00:02:41.340
 the number of sides and random events 

00:02:39.390 --> 00:02:43.650
 the traditional task is to take and 

00:02:41.340 --> 00:02:45.840
 ports are similar to the capture of checkpoints from 

00:02:43.650 --> 00:02:47.970
 third part only ports here at times 

00:02:45.840 --> 00:02:49.530
 more harder to take them also here is full 

00:02:47.970 --> 00:02:52.379
 standard missions bounty hunt 

00:02:49.530 --> 00:02:53.519
 treasure search help enpis and of course 

00:02:52.379 --> 00:02:55.079
 same animal hunting 

00:02:53.519 --> 00:02:57.360
 she hasn't changed much 

00:02:55.079 --> 00:02:59.579
 but added a new beast like 

00:02:57.360 --> 00:03:02.909
 elephants rhinos and even hiding 

00:02:59.579 --> 00:03:05.190
 somewhere the yeti remained without special 

00:03:02.909 --> 00:03:06.989
 changes and random events going through 

00:03:05.190 --> 00:03:08.760
 mountain pass trying not to fly away 

00:03:06.989 --> 00:03:10.799
 narrow road see the rebels 

00:03:08.760 --> 00:03:12.269
 fighting the army of the king only 

00:03:10.799 --> 00:03:13.889
 we start to shoot like slices 

00:03:12.269 --> 00:03:16.560
 jumps out some kind of animals are attacking 

00:03:13.889 --> 00:03:18.959
 at all indiscriminately the law of the open world 

00:03:16.560 --> 00:03:20.690
 out of the headlights, the edge 3 has not gone anywhere and is great 

00:03:18.959 --> 00:03:23.280
 work here 

00:03:20.690 --> 00:03:24.930
 if you put all these factors together and 

00:03:23.280 --> 00:03:27.750
 add here dynamic skirmishes 

00:03:24.930 --> 00:03:29.940
 with which the game is very saturated 

00:03:27.750 --> 00:03:33.090
 quite to yourself pretty well essentially the same 

00:03:29.940 --> 00:03:36.090
 headlight edge 3 only bigger and better though 

00:03:33.090 --> 00:03:38.489
 no, the game would be great now 

00:03:36.090 --> 00:03:41.060
 talk about the whole tar ladies which 

00:03:38.489 --> 00:03:43.590
 the developers shamelessly banged here 

00:03:41.060 --> 00:03:45.389
 you know there is such a joke that is very 

00:03:43.590 --> 00:03:48.239
 well illustrates this whole situation 

00:03:45.389 --> 00:03:49.949
 why am i the worst company at least 

00:03:48.239 --> 00:03:52.620
 Yes, because Yubisoft is in 

00:03:49.949 --> 00:03:54.930
 france so here's the key claim is 

00:03:52.620 --> 00:03:56.790
 yubisoft is the most funny thing minus 

00:03:54.930 --> 00:03:58.260
 standard claims of this kind 

00:03:56.790 --> 00:04:01.109
 games and which I will tell later 

00:03:58.260 --> 00:04:03.389
 headlights edge 4 turned out cool but kills 

00:04:01.109 --> 00:04:05.549
 French relations to their gram lived 

00:04:03.389 --> 00:04:07.349
 This is the natural optimization that is here 

00:04:05.549 --> 00:04:09.269
 compared to unity, it's perfect 

00:04:07.349 --> 00:04:11.340
 many deciding periodic hangs and 

00:04:09.269 --> 00:04:13.169
 tobacco black screen after failure 

00:04:11.340 --> 00:04:15.209
 missions or some cut-scenes this is not 

00:04:13.169 --> 00:04:17.609
 opportunity to change the voice acting and of course 

00:04:15.209 --> 00:04:20.280
 same missing attention licensed version 

00:04:17.609 --> 00:04:22.800
 cc you play and the result was funny for 

00:04:20.280 --> 00:04:25.020
 minus optimization patched pirate 

00:04:22.800 --> 00:04:27.090
 turned out to be a cure for all the problems here and 

00:04:25.020 --> 00:04:29.159
 nasty you play no and voice without 

00:04:27.090 --> 00:04:31.080
 problems put the original just not 

00:04:29.159 --> 00:04:33.120
 opportunities to play co-op without 

00:04:31.080 --> 00:04:35.370
 which is much more boring to play because 

00:04:33.120 --> 00:04:36.900
 he works everywhere except story missions 

00:04:35.370 --> 00:04:39.750
 that is to say roughly you can pass 

00:04:36.900 --> 00:04:41.180
 percent 70 games where as faster and with 

00:04:39.750 --> 00:04:43.940
 great pleasure 

00:04:41.180 --> 00:04:45.860
 and here begins those very 

00:04:43.940 --> 00:04:47.449
 standard problems of similar games about 

00:04:45.860 --> 00:04:49.729
 which I promised to tell 

00:04:47.449 --> 00:04:51.710
 the cooperative is insanely cool however many 

00:04:49.729 --> 00:04:53.300
 mission without it is very, very difficult 

00:04:51.710 --> 00:04:55.370
 pass the same ford and brothers whether 

00:04:53.300 --> 00:04:56.960
 to free the hostages last from me 

00:04:55.370 --> 00:04:59.090
 In general, it happened that after several 

00:04:56.960 --> 00:05:01.130
 zapara vanyu similar mission just 

00:04:59.090 --> 00:05:03.080
 knocked out the game since run last 

00:05:01.130 --> 00:05:04.669
 checkpoint to the desired point and again 

00:05:03.080 --> 00:05:06.400
 fight the terrorists on two fronts 

00:05:04.669 --> 00:05:08.479
 I'm tired 

00:05:06.400 --> 00:05:09.410
 the next moment actually 

00:05:08.479 --> 00:05:11.210
 terrorists 

00:05:09.410 --> 00:05:13.310
 for starters I will say that as in the case of 

00:05:11.210 --> 00:05:15.139
 recent advanced warfare chief 

00:05:13.310 --> 00:05:17.120
 Charismatic Dude's villain 

00:05:15.139 --> 00:05:19.039
 part-time quickly pushed on 

00:05:17.120 --> 00:05:21.410
 second plan so it turns out that first 

00:05:19.039 --> 00:05:23.389
 we are shown a huge scene with him 

00:05:21.410 --> 00:05:25.610
 deliver the drive interspersed with madness 

00:05:23.389 --> 00:05:27.410
 peygana mine and then lets go on everything 

00:05:25.610 --> 00:05:28.699
 four sides to communicate with the king 

00:05:27.410 --> 00:05:30.830
 kirata on the radio 

00:05:28.699 --> 00:05:32.930
 some kind of nonsense villain himself came out quite good 

00:05:30.830 --> 00:05:35.270
 by the way compared to the vaas from the past 

00:05:32.930 --> 00:05:37.160
 parts voices him again troy 

00:05:35.270 --> 00:05:52.699
 baker which i call scarlett 

00:05:37.160 --> 00:05:54.590
 johansson gaming industry well and 

00:05:52.699 --> 00:05:57.050
 certainly not gone away convention 

00:05:54.590 --> 00:05:58.849
 similar stories if headlights edge 3 of 

00:05:57.050 --> 00:06:00.979
 glamorous cloth diligently loved 

00:05:58.849 --> 00:06:03.050
 island rambo then in this part a hero with 

00:06:00.979 --> 00:06:05.240
 the first minutes in batches mows down enemies 

00:06:03.050 --> 00:06:07.460
 lara croft syndrome face plowed floor 

00:06:05.240 --> 00:06:09.440
 pirate riddled with bullets dozens or even 

00:06:07.460 --> 00:06:11.750
 hundreds of terrorists of mating belly 

00:06:09.440 --> 00:06:13.190
 the animal is disgusted though ok 

00:06:11.750 --> 00:06:15.229
 you can still argue with that 

00:06:13.190 --> 00:06:17.479
 here's the plot side when we would face 

00:06:15.229 --> 00:06:18.889
 poked moral choice yes here again 

00:06:17.479 --> 00:06:21.110
 there is a dilemma between bad and good 

00:06:18.889 --> 00:06:23.060
 just the border by the end of the game between them 

00:06:21.110 --> 00:06:25.250
 completely blurred genuine 

00:06:23.060 --> 00:06:27.289
 surprise they bad tell us and you 

00:06:25.250 --> 00:06:30.050
 he also look at who you turned 

00:06:27.289 --> 00:06:32.300
 so sorry not got out the very beginning of the game 

00:06:30.050 --> 00:06:34.220
 I was forced to do it but as I have 

00:06:32.300 --> 00:06:35.990
 said this all the standard niggles 

00:06:34.220 --> 00:06:38.419
 which is enough for many games only 

00:06:35.990 --> 00:06:41.150
 here it is too striking 

00:06:38.419 --> 00:06:43.180
 for example fell from the mountain were treated but how 

00:06:41.150 --> 00:06:46.180
 pulled out of the hand and bullet 

00:06:43.180 --> 00:06:48.130
 what it is but hereby they 

00:06:46.180 --> 00:06:50.139
 conditional jamb is for example 

00:06:48.130 --> 00:06:52.360
 the moment we set the alarm 

00:06:50.139 --> 00:06:54.370
 on our watch there we somehow twist 

00:06:52.360 --> 00:06:56.440
 bezel which is generally another function 

00:06:54.370 --> 00:06:58.509
 perform honestly say I was amazed 

00:06:56.440 --> 00:07:00.550
 such an error given how good 

00:06:58.509 --> 00:07:01.270
 the French have worked other small 

00:07:00.550 --> 00:07:04.539
 the details 

00:07:01.270 --> 00:07:06.880
 but what can not close my eyes 

00:07:04.539 --> 00:07:09.130
 so exactly so let's say this factor 

00:07:06.880 --> 00:07:10.930
 yubisoft that's seriously objectively a game 

00:07:09.130 --> 00:07:12.580
 get cool in her stick 

00:07:10.930 --> 00:07:14.199
 possible for a long time if you have it 

00:07:12.580 --> 00:07:16.240
 There is of course plenty 

00:07:14.199 --> 00:07:18.460
 but the tradition of the French to steam their 

00:07:16.240 --> 00:07:20.320
 projects all apartments as well as new manners 

00:07:18.460 --> 00:07:22.509
 solve this kind of problem having failed 

00:07:20.320 --> 00:07:26.050
 players albeit free but buggy 

00:07:22.509 --> 00:07:27.849
 far cry 4 games are definitely worth it 

00:07:26.050 --> 00:07:30.099
 not just to play it 

00:07:27.849 --> 00:07:35.110
 buy because there is pay there for 

00:07:30.099 --> 00:07:36.789
 that's just not a big amount on 

00:07:35.110 --> 00:07:38.860
 This I have all with you was a joker 

00:07:36.789 --> 00:07:41.110
 keep watching me subscribe 

00:07:38.860 --> 00:07:42.970
 call friends here and put likes 

00:07:41.110 --> 00:07:45.729
 video as well as write in the comments 

00:07:42.970 --> 00:07:47.789
 did you like far cry 4 or not all 

00:07:45.729 --> 00:07:47.789
 until
