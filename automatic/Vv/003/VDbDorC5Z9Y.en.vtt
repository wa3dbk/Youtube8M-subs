00:00:17.320 --> 00:00:20.350
 I hope you are well I will 

00:00:18.580 --> 00:00:22.510
 found today for the recipe 

00:00:20.350 --> 00:00:24.160
 easy of the week it is small 

00:00:22.510 --> 00:00:25.240
 cookies so that will satisfy people 

00:00:24.160 --> 00:00:26.710
 who pay attention to their line 

00:00:25.240 --> 00:00:28.750
 since there are very few materials 

00:00:26.710 --> 00:00:30.340
 fat in it and finally there is no 

00:00:28.750 --> 00:00:31.960
 gluten either so right away the 

00:00:30.340 --> 00:00:33.970
 ingredients then you will need 

00:00:31.960 --> 00:00:36.460
 a tablespoon of fresh cream 

00:00:33.970 --> 00:00:37.870
 it will replace fat one 

00:00:36.460 --> 00:00:40.870
 handle currants or 

00:00:37.870 --> 00:00:42.340
 chocolate chips an egg half a 

00:00:40.870 --> 00:00:45.340
 teaspoon of baking soda 

00:00:42.340 --> 00:00:47.740
 food of applesauce 200 

00:00:45.340 --> 00:00:49.570
 grams and rice flour here so 

00:00:47.740 --> 00:00:52.450
 gluten-free or normal flour if 

00:00:49.570 --> 00:00:53.590
 you eat gluten 125 g finally a 

00:00:52.450 --> 00:00:55.540
 pinch of cinnamon 

00:00:53.590 --> 00:00:56.830
 I will start simply by 

00:00:55.540 --> 00:01:02.140
 mix the ingredients of which rather 

00:00:56.830 --> 00:01:03.730
 so I liquid cream if you m 

00:01:02.140 --> 00:01:04.960
 do not eat dairy products you 

00:01:03.730 --> 00:01:07.000
 can not put the cream 

00:01:04.960 --> 00:01:10.900
 it's a possibility I'm going to break 

00:01:07.000 --> 00:01:12.820
 the egg also you see in this 

00:01:10.900 --> 00:01:15.549
 cookie recipe we do not add 

00:01:12.820 --> 00:01:18.969
 sugar since it is the sugar content 

00:01:15.549 --> 00:01:19.689
 in the applesauce that goes sweet 

00:01:18.969 --> 00:01:21.340
 do not cookies 

00:01:19.689 --> 00:01:23.829
 but if you want you can put 

00:01:21.340 --> 00:01:25.200
 a little bit of stevia for example or 

00:01:23.829 --> 00:01:29.719
 sweetener 

00:01:25.200 --> 00:01:33.390
 which is suitable for cooking here I mix 

00:01:29.719 --> 00:01:39.210
 quietly I put a spoon to 

00:01:33.390 --> 00:01:42.030
 cinnamon coffee my bicarbonate lo 

00:01:39.210 --> 00:01:44.130
 and finally so the flour and I will come 

00:01:42.030 --> 00:01:47.340
 integrate all that quietly 

00:01:44.130 --> 00:01:50.340
 mixing you can already do 

00:01:47.340 --> 00:01:52.319
 preheat your oven to 180 ° our costs 

00:01:50.340 --> 00:01:54.590
 that they will cook a dozen 

00:01:52.319 --> 00:01:54.590
 minutes 

00:01:59.429 --> 00:02:03.270
 I spread my cookie preparation on a 

00:02:01.200 --> 00:02:04.289
 baking sheet covered with 

00:02:03.270 --> 00:02:09.360
 parchment paper 

00:02:04.289 --> 00:02:10.979
 I space them a little bit then there 

00:02:09.360 --> 00:02:12.780
 it's really the minimum of ingredients 

00:02:10.979 --> 00:02:14.010
 now you can add some 

00:02:12.780 --> 00:02:16.590
 little things inside to decorate it 

00:02:14.010 --> 00:02:18.239
 which is not bad for example 

00:02:16.590 --> 00:02:21.239
 black chocolate chips 

00:02:18.239 --> 00:02:22.950
 what I want to do is that I m ​​of 

00:02:21.239 --> 00:02:24.750
 grapes in you can put them 

00:02:22.950 --> 00:02:27.329
 directly in the dough or then 

00:02:24.750 --> 00:02:32.040
 scattered d 1 sec but quite a part 

00:02:27.329 --> 00:02:33.269
 besides that's gonna I'm going to put 

00:02:32.040 --> 00:02:36.690
 just a little bit our cut what 

00:02:33.269 --> 00:02:37.859
 I love it before baking it was not 

00:02:36.690 --> 00:02:41.069
 in the list of ingredients but hey 

00:02:37.859 --> 00:02:42.239
 I have it in the closet and it's like 

00:02:41.069 --> 00:02:43.680
 that in general that the best 

00:02:42.239 --> 00:02:44.480
 recipes happen when we put the stuff 

00:02:43.680 --> 00:02:47.400
 a bit random 

00:02:44.480 --> 00:02:53.120
 perfect and people do so it's gone 

00:02:47.400 --> 00:02:53.120
 my hot oven 189 about 12 minutes 

00:02:55.760 --> 00:03:02.780
 here I come out cookies light 

00:02:58.760 --> 00:03:06.019
 and quick of the oven you put them on 

00:03:02.780 --> 00:03:08.329
 a grid for them to cool and 

00:03:06.019 --> 00:03:10.909
 then you can taste them without 

00:03:08.329 --> 00:03:12.200
 blame there so apart 

00:03:10.909 --> 00:03:13.220
 the teaspoon of fresh cream and 

00:03:12.200 --> 00:03:16.280
 again I took to be a preacher 

00:03:13.220 --> 00:03:18.319
 lighten up there are really few materials 

00:03:16.280 --> 00:03:19.610
 fat from the shot made added sugar it's 

00:03:18.319 --> 00:03:21.079
 only that of a compote at the level of 

00:03:19.610 --> 00:03:22.400
 of the texture I show you so this is 

00:03:21.079 --> 00:03:27.290
 great because these cookies are good 

00:03:22.400 --> 00:03:29.120
 you see it's like little 

00:03:27.290 --> 00:03:32.530
 cupcakes with a texture of 

00:03:29.120 --> 00:03:32.530
 textures of some shopping almost 

00:03:33.879 --> 00:03:39.920
 so if you are dieting or if you 

00:03:37.819 --> 00:03:41.870
 be careful it's perfect a little 

00:03:39.920 --> 00:03:43.849
 incase you have the fruit is not of 

00:03:41.870 --> 00:03:45.049
 gluten no more here I wish you 

00:03:43.849 --> 00:03:48.829
 a very good appetite if you liked 

00:03:45.049 --> 00:03:50.840
