00:01:19.340 --> 00:01:19.350 
two months which actually i think is a

00:01:19.350 --> 00:01:21.469 
two months which actually i think is a
record<00:01:19.740> so<00:01:20.310> long<00:01:20.520> may<00:01:20.670> it<00:01:20.700> continue<00:01:20.820> and

00:01:21.469 --> 00:01:21.479 
record so long may it continue and

00:01:21.479 --> 00:01:23.179 
record so long may it continue and
obviously<00:01:21.869> by<00:01:22.110> you<00:01:22.170> guys<00:01:22.439> supporting<00:01:22.920> that<00:01:23.070> is

obviously by you guys supporting that is
pretty<00:01:23.369> much<00:01:23.520> how<00:01:23.700> it<00:01:23.729> will<00:01:23.970> continue<00:01:24.299> and

00:01:24.679 --> 00:01:24.689 
pretty much how it will continue and

00:01:24.689 --> 00:01:26.359 
pretty much how it will continue and
every<00:01:25.080> time<00:01:25.229> I<00:01:25.320> post<00:01:25.470> the<00:01:25.650> video<00:01:25.890> I've<00:01:26.159> been
