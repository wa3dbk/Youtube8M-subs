00:00:02.490 --> 00:00:07.860
 tumor advertised last year 

00:00:05.169 --> 00:00:11.170
 unlimited everything 'calling sms and internet 

00:00:07.860 --> 00:00:12.339
 but unlimited internet does not seem 

00:00:11.170 --> 00:00:13.990
 unlimited 

00:00:12.339 --> 00:00:16.090
 in the small print on the abri 

00:00:13.990 --> 00:00:17.740
 that your speed goes down if you have one 

00:00:16.090 --> 00:00:20.260
 used a certain amount of data 

00:00:17.740 --> 00:00:21.820
 and then you can't go with that low speed 

00:00:20.260 --> 00:00:23.439
 watch more movies and you can't 

00:00:21.820 --> 00:00:25.210
 music for my listening 

00:00:23.439 --> 00:00:27.490
 the consumer association thinks you don't like that 

00:00:25.210 --> 00:00:28.980
 unlimited internet and served 

00:00:27.490 --> 00:00:31.359
 complaint to the advertising code committee 

00:00:28.980 --> 00:00:33.399
 who judged you to be the little one 

00:00:31.359 --> 00:00:35.890
 print at the abri can not 

00:00:33.399 --> 00:00:37.899
 understand that with unlimited internet 

00:00:35.890 --> 00:00:39.430
 string cut back and practical 

00:00:37.899 --> 00:00:41.620
 use becomes impossible 

00:00:39.430 --> 00:00:44.160
 the street advertising therefore had to be 

00:00:41.620 --> 00:00:44.160
 adjusted 

00:00:44.410 --> 00:00:47.980
 unfortunately t-mobile the term remains unlimited 

00:00:46.360 --> 00:00:48.820
 internet in combination with small 

00:00:47.980 --> 00:00:51.190
 print 

00:00:48.820 --> 00:00:52.960
 just use it on twitter we see 

00:00:51.190 --> 00:00:55.300
 lots of tweets about this every day 

00:00:52.960 --> 00:00:56.739
 subject with questions from people also in 

00:00:55.300 --> 00:00:58.960
 advertises newspaper advertisements 

00:00:56.739 --> 00:01:01.390
 t-mobile with unlimited internet with 

00:00:58.960 --> 00:01:03.430
 small print there but whole 

00:01:01.390 --> 00:01:05.740
 small who can read this 

00:01:03.430 --> 00:01:07.390
 yes if you see them like that then it is the trend 

00:01:05.740 --> 00:01:10.060
 with straight small print 

00:01:07.390 --> 00:01:11.440
 white print on a pink background 

00:01:10.060 --> 00:01:13.510
 for contrast of course not very 

00:01:11.440 --> 00:01:14.440
 tasty and I don't think it's on this one 

00:01:13.510 --> 00:01:17.730
 way 

00:01:14.440 --> 00:01:17.730
 is legible for the whole of the Netherlands 

00:01:18.760 --> 00:01:23.530
 well they are very, very, very small 

00:01:21.940 --> 00:01:27.130
 if you need this font well 

00:01:23.530 --> 00:01:29.050
 compares with this font then it is 

00:01:27.130 --> 00:01:31.390
 comparable to the smallest 

00:01:29.050 --> 00:01:33.250
 what kind of printed in the Netherlands 

00:01:31.390 --> 00:01:34.930
 can become what you can still read 

00:01:33.250 --> 00:01:36.160
 yes yes so I can read it but yes it is 

00:01:34.930 --> 00:01:38.740
 piece not meant to be him and 

00:01:36.160 --> 00:01:41.080
 operation glasses on an advertisement must 

00:01:38.740 --> 00:01:43.060
 so read without tools 

00:01:41.080 --> 00:01:44.830
 People don't know what's in the little 

00:01:43.060 --> 00:01:46.930
 apparently you like that 

00:01:44.830 --> 00:01:49.750
 important because the unlimited 

00:01:46.930 --> 00:01:51.340
 is apparently not unlimited 

00:01:49.750 --> 00:01:53.590
 we also advertised there 

00:01:51.340 --> 00:01:56.230
 a predicate of the consumer association 

00:01:53.590 --> 00:01:59.100
 for t-mobile and completely in style with 

00:01:56.230 --> 00:01:59.100
 private ads
