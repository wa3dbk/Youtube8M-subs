00:00:00.659 --> 00:00:04.950
 yon is one of many medium who accepted to undergo tests in the 

00:00:04.950 --> 00:00:07.700
 arizona university 

00:00:07.700 --> 00:00:13.750
 we are rushing now with 19 inputs and sectors experiments 

00:00:13.750 --> 00:00:18.689
 conditions we will each more controlled than the previous 

00:00:19.239 --> 00:00:22.689
 from the most controlled was to make the media or the 

00:00:22.689 --> 00:00:25.849
 volunteers electroencephalograms and electrocardiograms 

00:00:27.029 --> 00:00:32.700
 good one of the ways to know if the medium and formulates questions reading the 

00:00:32.699 --> 00:00:35.460
 of the volunteer in one of the deceased 

00:00:35.460 --> 00:00:42.360
 excluding brain waves and cardiac activity ie the heart 

00:00:42.360 --> 00:00:45.890
 and the middle brain of a spectator riot at the same time 

00:00:50.060 --> 00:00:53.880
 the medium never encounters the subject and are kept separated by a 

00:00:53.880 --> 00:00:54.590
 screen 

00:00:54.590 --> 00:00:58.750
 Yoon and the other media should have as much information as possible about 

00:00:58.750 --> 00:01:02.020
 relatives of the subject's deceased 

00:01:02.020 --> 00:01:05.030
 I am going to say what I am seeing and hearing and without clients 

00:01:05.030 --> 00:01:08.200
 I would tell you that finally verify information only slogan dyn 

00:01:08.200 --> 00:01:11.590
 The first thing he asks me to do is talk to him about a male figure that 

00:01:11.590 --> 00:01:15.140
 his side that could be a husband a brother who has just passed away the client 

00:01:15.140 --> 00:01:20.600
 are included there are actually two must be respected after citing a couple of 

00:01:20.600 --> 00:01:23.850
 occasions when he could not get more information about this matter 

00:01:23.850 --> 00:01:27.540
 I know that people wondered why I do not know 

00:01:27.540 --> 00:01:31.920
 maybe it's me a note we feel good and that's why he deserved to be a person 

00:01:31.920 --> 00:01:37.250
 but sometimes population got accurate information sometimes the subjects 

00:01:37.250 --> 00:01:42.820
 they thought he was wrong and then they realized that he did not 

00:01:42.820 --> 00:01:46.980
 or the subject did not have the answer that he had to ask a relative 

00:01:46.979 --> 00:01:50.270
 or friend and found out that I was right 

00:01:52.200 --> 00:01:56.520
 yonny's level of accuracy was on average 80 to 90 percent 

00:01:57.610 --> 00:02:01.370
 and the electros showed me in his second brain in and his rhythm 

00:02:01.370 --> 00:02:04.370
 heart were equal to those of the subject 

00:02:06.550 --> 00:02:10.430
 we discovered that the heart of the working class neighborhood was in sync with that of the 

00:02:10.430 --> 00:02:11.419
 subject 

00:02:11.419 --> 00:02:14.919
 which of course implies that I was paying attention to something else 

00:02:15.479 --> 00:02:18.189
 he also asked him to happen again 

00:02:18.189 --> 00:02:21.189
 Yesterday but yesterday 

00:02:23.979 --> 00:02:28.269
 the concert apparently needs but she is nobody is true 

00:02:29.249 --> 00:02:33.149
 more about the experiments I did in the production lab 

00:02:35.059 --> 00:02:38.849
 I came to the conclusion of 2009 that without a doubt 

00:02:39.639 --> 00:02:41.129
 It's not about that 

00:02:41.129 --> 00:02:43.639
 they gave me 

00:02:43.639 --> 00:02:48.009
 the so-called life experiments after death created a great controversy 

00:02:48.009 --> 00:02:52.189
 in the scientific community partly because it generated more questions than 

00:02:52.189 --> 00:02:53.839
 answers 

00:02:53.839 --> 00:02:55.499
 oo in the present 

00:02:55.499 --> 00:03:01.769
 scientifically we do not know how or languages ​​like I do in addition to what 

00:03:01.769 --> 00:03:02.979
 What do they do 

00:03:02.979 --> 00:03:07.959
 the hypothesis that we tested in the laboratory is that we all have 

00:03:07.959 --> 00:03:13.709
 energy and that this is continuous as the light of distant stars and what 

00:03:13.709 --> 00:03:19.959
 includes others do is to use their brain and their consciousness as antenna and receiver and 

00:03:19.959 --> 00:03:23.009
 they learned to tune into the signals that are present 

00:03:23.979 --> 00:03:28.129
 they lower the volume of noise and that is that they receive these signals are subtle 

00:03:29.139 --> 00:03:33.640
 the concept of a structure of connected reality 

00:03:33.640 --> 00:03:37.920
 although which we are part only by existing is similar to force in 

00:03:37.920 --> 00:03:41.219
 star Wars 

00:03:41.219 --> 00:03:45.199
 There comes a time when kobe cuban I began to feel disturbances in the 

00:03:45.199 --> 00:03:48.199
 force when a planet explodes 

00:03:50.709 --> 00:03:55.539
 and in that sense you can feel waves traveling through space time the 

00:03:55.539 --> 00:04:00.969
 phenomenon that we call extrasensory perception will surely operate from a 

00:04:00.969 --> 00:04:03.969
 way very much like force 

00:04:04.679 --> 00:04:08.279
 nósik and with you have a name for this remote collection 

00:04:08.279 --> 00:04:10.519
 quantum entanglement 

00:04:10.519 --> 00:04:14.049
 So far it's just a theory applied electrons and molecules 

00:04:15.589 --> 00:04:18.889
 Scientists do not yet know if it can be applied to the brain 

00:04:19.789 --> 00:04:23.389
 but sooner than we thought it could be confirmed the existence of the 

00:04:23.389 --> 00:04:26.389
 Extrasensory perception 

00:04:27.029 --> 00:04:29.280
 it is always very difficult to predict 

00:04:29.280 --> 00:04:32.280
 when are you going to spend that guy 

00:04:33.120 --> 00:04:35.120
 I think maybe 

00:04:35.120 --> 00:04:37.759
 in 20 years 

00:04:37.759 --> 00:04:38.919
 from here to 20 years
