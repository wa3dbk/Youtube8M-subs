 unsaturated monounsaturated and 

00:00:25.030 --> 00:00:30.310
 polyunsaturated bad and good 

00:00:28.090 --> 00:00:32.080

 understand fats fats are 

00:00:38.470 --> 00:00:42.730
 source of energy is needed for us 

00:00:40.570 --> 00:00:43.540
 as many as 9 calories per gram and they make 

00:00:42.730 --> 00:00:45.400
 food is tastier 

00:00:43.540 --> 00:00:46.890
 fats in food represent 

00:00:45.400 --> 00:00:49.090
 a mixture of three main types 

00:00:46.890 --> 00:00:51.100
 saturated monounsaturated and 

00:00:49.090 --> 00:00:53.260
 polyunsaturated and also emit 

00:00:51.100 --> 00:00:54.850
 the fourth type is splashes saturated 

00:00:53.260 --> 00:00:56.680
 fats like tranches raise levels 

00:00:54.850 --> 00:00:58.660
 bad cholesterol and lower levels 

00:00:56.680 --> 00:01:00.700
 good which increases the risk of developing 

00:00:58.660 --> 00:01:02.920
 cardiovascular diseases and 

00:01:00.700 --> 00:01:04.300
 stroke waving cholesterol settles on 

00:01:02.920 --> 00:01:06.340
 the inner walls of the arteries and 

00:01:04.300 --> 00:01:08.619
 forms atherosclerotic plaques 

00:01:06.340 --> 00:01:10.630
 and good cholesterol picks up the arteries 

00:01:08.619 --> 00:01:12.369
 bad and leads and we on destruction in 

00:01:10.630 --> 00:01:13.780
 the liver is the most saturated fat 

00:01:12.369 --> 00:01:16.330
 found in animal fats 

00:01:13.780 --> 00:01:20.039

 high fat foods 

00:01:35.820 --> 00:01:39.580
 studies have shown that diets with 

00:01:37.930 --> 00:01:41.380
 high in saturated fat 

00:01:39.580 --> 00:01:43.210
 leads to aggressive disorders in 

00:01:41.380 --> 00:01:45.220
 children i mean they start tug 

00:01:43.210 --> 00:01:46.750
 to think crane explosion Nature 

00:01:45.220 --> 00:01:47.380
 rare and small 

00:01:46.750 --> 00:01:49.270
 quantities 

00:01:47.380 --> 00:01:50.830
 but mostly they are created by hands 

00:01:49.270 --> 00:01:53.290
 human main sources 

00:01:50.830 --> 00:01:55.300
 trans fats are hydrogenated 

00:01:53.290 --> 00:01:57.790
 and refined oils and products 

00:01:55.300 --> 00:01:59.040

 fats promote development 

00:02:03.670 --> 00:02:08.350
 atherosclerosis and hypertension obesity and 

00:02:05.920 --> 00:02:10.780
 diabetes and and many other terrible 

00:02:08.350 --> 00:02:12.910

 they help reduce the risk of developing 

00:02:17.110 --> 00:02:21.030
 heart disease and stroke due to 

00:02:19.450 --> 00:02:23.380
 lower bad cholesterol 

00:02:21.030 --> 00:02:25.230

 unsaturated fats are used to 

00:02:42.110 --> 00:02:46.550
 synthesis of steroid hormones and some 

00:02:44.780 --> 00:02:49.730
 other biologically active sydney 

00:02:46.550 --> 00:02:51.710
 phospholipids are synthesized from them bricks 

00:02:49.730 --> 00:02:53.810
 of which our membranes are built 

00:02:51.710 --> 00:02:55.580
 cells also exist essential fats 

00:02:53.810 --> 00:02:57.950
 more precisely essential fatty acids 

00:02:55.580 --> 00:02:58.930
 omega 3 and omega 6 are irreplaceable because 

00:02:57.950 --> 00:03:01.460
 that cannot be synthesized 

00:02:58.930 --> 00:03:05.510
 by the body and must flow into the body 

00:03:01.460 --> 00:03:07.580
 externally, fats are essential for healthy skin 

00:03:05.510 --> 00:03:09.650

 30 percent the remaining 70 remain on 

00:03:14.000 --> 00:03:20.050
 belly and thighs and unsaturated 

00:03:15.740 --> 00:03:20.050
 fats are broken down by the body completely 

00:03:24.370 --> 00:03:28.489
 normal amount of body fat 

00:03:26.599 --> 00:03:32.060
 for women is 25-30 percent

 for men, 1823 brain cells are more than 

00:03:32.060 --> 00:03:35.870
 60 percent are made up of fat and 

00:03:33.859 --> 00:03:37.489
 lack of fat entering the body 

00:03:35.870 --> 00:03:37.939
