00:01:07.260 --> 00:01:13.170
 Okay good vale to see I 'll start with 

00:01:11.040 --> 00:01:15.780
 the biggest comes to this gel if you 

00:01:13.170 --> 00:01:19.260
 I know this must be the French if 

00:01:15.780 --> 00:01:21.690
 the papers for cool is the sparkling 

00:01:19.260 --> 00:01:23.070
 Soapless and can cleaner 

00:01:21.690 --> 00:01:24.390
 purify oily skin with 

00:01:23.070 --> 00:01:27.090
 imperfections 

00:01:24.390 --> 00:01:30.210
 I have this gel because it came in the 

00:01:27.090 --> 00:01:31.770
 in a gloss and bojan beauty came this 

00:01:30.210 --> 00:01:33.720
 gel cleaner and is the one that I am 

00:01:31.770 --> 00:01:35.100
 currently using and I have to say 

00:01:33.720 --> 00:01:37.290
 that I love is a product that 

00:01:35.100 --> 00:01:39.180
 I really like it, I do not like it so much 

00:01:37.290 --> 00:01:41.040
 have repeated in another box but good 

00:01:39.180 --> 00:01:42.810
 the product itself really if it's not 

00:01:41.040 --> 00:01:45.120
 proof is great I am that I use 

00:01:42.810 --> 00:01:47.310
 I currently like a lot so 

00:01:45.120 --> 00:01:51.409
 that product and good is original size 

00:01:47.310 --> 00:01:54.460
 of course then let's see this 

00:01:51.409 --> 00:02:00.250
 that looks like a vanilla lip balm 

00:01:54.460 --> 00:02:03.610
 without natural pure natural and 100% organic 

00:02:00.250 --> 00:02:08.020
 organic oh well great why not 

00:02:03.610 --> 00:02:09.700
 lin face lips and body band or is it a 

00:02:08.020 --> 00:02:11.440
 balsam that should be a balm 

00:02:09.700 --> 00:02:14.290
 repairman for any part of the 

00:02:11.440 --> 00:02:18.100
 body puts this natural product 

00:02:14.290 --> 00:02:20.350
 so great 100% natural 

00:02:18.100 --> 00:02:21.970
 that's great this type of products 

00:02:20.350 --> 00:02:25.060
 Vaseline if all the fruits are 

00:02:21.970 --> 00:02:26.950
 very bad because everything is derived from 

00:02:25.060 --> 00:02:29.200
 oil then if you can use 

00:02:26.950 --> 00:02:31.120
 lip balms and good in general 

00:02:29.200 --> 00:02:33.820
 everything as pure as possible with less 

00:02:31.120 --> 00:02:35.200
 chemical products more than products 

00:02:33.820 --> 00:02:37.540
 Chemical products derived from 

00:02:35.200 --> 00:02:39.400
 oil well much better then good 

00:02:37.540 --> 00:02:43.350
 in this case, we 're going to see where 

00:02:39.400 --> 00:02:43.350
 is from what country is this 

00:02:43.780 --> 00:02:49.900
 order is the brand is this fix and rose 

00:02:50.060 --> 00:02:56.120
 and this is from uk it 's a balm 

00:02:53.300 --> 00:02:58.550
 adult soft 100% natural that protects 

00:02:56.120 --> 00:03:00.319
 your skin against dryness apply on 

00:02:58.550 --> 00:03:02.599

00:03:00.319 --> 00:03:05.000
 Hydration is great need is 

00:03:02.599 --> 00:03:07.420

00:03:05.000 --> 00:03:10.580

00:03:07.420 --> 00:03:14.510
 now this product that I already see that I 

00:03:10.580 --> 00:03:16.700
 like they are a shadow duo I think 

00:03:14.510 --> 00:03:18.940
 let's open it 

00:03:16.700 --> 00:03:23.000
 If it's a shadow duo, bring a little mirror 

00:03:18.940 --> 00:03:26.890
 with the applicator and to keep applied 

00:03:23.000 --> 00:03:30.260
 It is a beautiful copper brown and a color 

00:03:26.890 --> 00:03:32.060
 beige with lovely shimmer I love to 

00:03:30.260 --> 00:03:35.690

00:03:41.599 --> 00:03:46.250
 eyes with two complementary tones that 

00:03:44.180 --> 00:03:48.080
 Can be used alone or together 

00:03:46.250 --> 00:03:50.299
 to create a different and long look 

00:03:48.080 --> 00:03:52.730

 let's see let's see this I imagine that already 

00:05:34.490 --> 00:05:39.470
 what is Spain because the only thing that remains 

00:05:36.230 --> 00:05:41.240
 So, from Spain, I made multivitamins 

00:05:39.470 --> 00:05:42.980
 More washcloth is makeup artist all for 

00:05:41.240 --> 00:05:45.320
 complex eyes antioxidant and 

00:05:42.980 --> 00:05:47.960
 Revitalizing with 6 vitamins pro 

00:05:45.320 --> 00:05:49.850
 retinol and hyaluronic acid protects 

00:05:47.960 --> 00:05:52.040
 cells and helps the regeneration of 

00:05:49.850 --> 00:05:55.000
 collagen and they are mini sizes are from 

00:05:52.040 --> 00:05:58.460
 sample is worth because 

00:05:55.000 --> 00:06:00.979
 and mini tasks are military so 

00:05:58.460 --> 00:06:02.990
 great this I have never tried either 

00:06:00.979 --> 00:06:04.970
 it sounds to me that this has also been 

00:06:02.990 --> 00:06:06.979
 sent in another box although I do not 

00:06:04.970 --> 00:06:09.139

00:06:06.979 --> 00:06:10.910
 of another month they have sent this then 

00:06:09.139 --> 00:06:12.440
 good in general is a house that has 

00:06:10.910 --> 00:06:14.449
 liked that it is several 

00:06:12.440 --> 00:06:15.770
 I really like products because it's 

00:06:14.449 --> 00:06:17.419
 true that there are times that you do not have the 

00:06:15.770 --> 00:06:19.250
 opportunity to try things of others 

00:06:17.419 --> 00:06:21.470
 countries because you do not have access to it and 

00:06:19.250 --> 00:06:22.910
 Well, I really like what I do not 

00:06:21.470 --> 00:06:24.410
 like they have repeated for example 

00:06:22.910 --> 00:06:26.120
 this product although it is a product that 

00:06:24.410 --> 00:06:28.639
 I like it because I'm using it but not 

00:06:26.120 --> 00:06:30.199
 I like that they have repeated but 

00:06:28.639 --> 00:06:32.449
 I have to say that I liked it 

00:06:30.199 --> 00:06:35.720
 I liked most I think is very 

00:06:32.449 --> 00:06:36.800
 well almost all are full site sizes of 

00:06:35.720 --> 00:06:38.720
