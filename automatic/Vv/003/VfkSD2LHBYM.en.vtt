00:02:02.429 --> 00:02:02.439 
the same as it did why but now we've

00:02:02.439 --> 00:02:05.270 
the same as it did why but now we've
thinned<00:02:02.890> it<00:02:02.979> out<00:02:03.159> and<00:02:03.549> it<00:02:04.479> can<00:02:04.630> fit<00:02:04.899> in<00:02:05.079> the

00:02:05.270 --> 00:02:05.280 
thinned it out and it can fit in the

00:02:05.280 --> 00:02:09.029 
thinned it out and it can fit in the
many<00:02:06.280> more<00:02:06.520> areas<00:02:06.929> you<00:02:07.929> can<00:02:08.110> resize<00:02:08.770> it<00:02:09.009> to

00:02:09.029 --> 00:02:09.039 
many more areas you can resize it to

00:02:09.039 --> 00:02:12.510 
many more areas you can resize it to
like<00:02:09.310> a<00:02:09.340> four<00:02:09.729> by<00:02:09.910> six<00:02:10.530> print<00:02:11.530> that<00:02:11.740> out<00:02:11.800> it's

00:02:12.510 --> 00:02:12.520 
like a four by six print that out it's

00:02:12.520 --> 00:02:16.150 
like a four by six print that out it's
almost<00:02:12.850> like<00:02:13.090> cropping<00:02:13.710> but

00:02:16.150 --> 00:02:16.160
