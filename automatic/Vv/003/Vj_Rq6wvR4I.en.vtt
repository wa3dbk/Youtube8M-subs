00:00:01.870 --> 00:00:10.990
 good hello and welcome to how to play 

00:00:06.129 --> 00:00:13.680
 against online strike in capture mode 

00:00:10.990 --> 00:00:16.550
 good flag 

00:00:13.680 --> 00:00:16.550
 we start 

00:00:28.870 --> 00:00:34.950
 Well, here I have it from ipe 

00:00:31.330 --> 00:00:34.950
 they will be left in the description 

00:00:38.450 --> 00:00:43.760
 remember who won everyone for 

00:00:41.480 --> 00:00:46.430
 charged for you but like I already 

00:00:43.760 --> 00:00:49.060
 I already have no good manager 

00:00:46.430 --> 00:00:49.060
 start to enter 

00:00:51.610 --> 00:00:54.660
 as a load 

00:00:57.440 --> 00:01:00.250
 well then 

00:01:00.270 --> 00:01:06.260
 and I started playing because I think I'm not 

00:01:03.270 --> 00:01:06.260
 the only one that alone 

00:01:06.330 --> 00:01:12.220
 For example, it seems that we are only 

00:01:09.700 --> 00:01:15.210
 two against one but I blew my head 

00:01:12.220 --> 00:01:15.210
 in that way 

00:01:15.790 --> 00:01:24.140
 I'm going to avenge where is where is 

00:01:21.180 --> 00:01:24.140
 to my friend 

00:01:24.430 --> 00:01:29.700
 but for example here we do not get 

00:01:27.010 --> 00:01:29.700
 new to the base 

00:01:29.780 --> 00:01:36.380
 my friend regained the flag always 

00:01:33.659 --> 00:01:36.380
 he killed the other 

00:01:36.659 --> 00:01:43.609
 but I also really get to 

00:01:40.289 --> 00:01:43.609
 pay the flag 

00:01:43.830 --> 00:01:48.470
 The objective of the game is to earn points 

00:01:49.909 --> 00:01:54.939
 for example here we have to capture the 

00:01:52.850 --> 00:01:54.939
 flag 

00:01:55.159 --> 00:02:02.260
 for example here I have it right now 

00:01:59.090 --> 00:02:04.510
 and my friend killed the other one 

00:02:02.260 --> 00:02:08.290
 this because the variable to flag 

00:02:04.510 --> 00:02:10.000
 for some reason the game shows your 

00:02:08.290 --> 00:02:13.340
 position to be an advantage for 

00:02:10.000 --> 00:02:18.830
 the team that stole the flag 

00:02:13.340 --> 00:02:23.740
 and well, here I already have coins 

00:02:18.830 --> 00:02:23.740
 and against me and I will buy myself a better 

00:02:23.800 --> 00:02:29.250
 well then 

00:02:26.670 --> 00:02:32.300
 I will buy this since this is one of the 

00:02:29.250 --> 00:02:32.300
 better than I could have 

00:02:33.430 --> 00:02:41.770
 do not 

00:02:35.920 --> 00:02:45.190
 I lost my good gun well there is the 

00:02:41.770 --> 00:02:47.890
 flag and hid until you get it right 

00:02:45.190 --> 00:02:50.650
 so by the flag all find them 

00:02:47.890 --> 00:02:55.140
 and take the flag be dead 

00:02:50.650 --> 00:02:55.140
 me being the red that I'm behind 

00:02:55.740 --> 00:02:59.390
 to go find him 

00:03:02.550 --> 00:03:06.290
 back here I saw it 

00:03:08.350 --> 00:03:14.900
 no no I'm not very good 

00:03:11.160 --> 00:03:18.180
 well, the objective of the game 

00:03:14.900 --> 00:03:19.770
 explained there is more pregnant than 

00:03:18.180 --> 00:03:21.420
 shopping with the baby but it's not like that 

00:03:19.770 --> 00:03:23.700
 originally like shopping against 

00:03:21.420 --> 00:03:25.530
 the bots not here already costs with the 

00:03:23.700 --> 00:03:28.280
 numbers 

00:03:25.530 --> 00:03:30.569
 for example here I bought myself this weapon 

00:03:28.280 --> 00:03:34.370
 It was very poor quality so I do not know 

00:03:30.569 --> 00:03:34.370
 I recommend but I used as an example 

00:03:34.890 --> 00:03:40.990
 well then 

00:03:37.370 --> 00:03:44.400
 touch search to 7 

00:03:40.990 --> 00:03:44.400
 I'm going to remove your flag 

00:03:44.500 --> 00:03:47.760
 because I want to avenge myself 

00:03:52.280 --> 00:03:58.540
 not very bad well 

00:03:55.569 --> 00:04:01.160
 the goal is to win but I eat already 

00:03:58.540 --> 00:04:04.660
 I got bored 

00:04:01.160 --> 00:04:07.640
 Well, if you want to find me as 

00:04:04.660 --> 00:04:09.650
 as a player with the strike is my 

00:04:07.640 --> 00:04:15.210

00:04:22.900 --> 00:04:26.970
