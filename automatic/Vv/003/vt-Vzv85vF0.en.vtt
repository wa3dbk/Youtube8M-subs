00:00:09.260 --> 00:00:17.600
 good afternoon to all enthusiast essential 

00:00:15.690 --> 00:00:22.109
 mechanics 

00:00:17.600 --> 00:00:24.990
 idea in a way of opportunities and achievements 

00:00:22.109 --> 00:00:29.519
 the result is getting energy from 

00:00:24.990 --> 00:00:32.700
 Ferran surrounding us first one 

00:00:29.519 --> 00:00:37.340
 stunning even number and the number of 

00:00:32.700 --> 00:00:39.960
 very large there are so many experiences 

00:00:37.340 --> 00:00:42.750
 proving that the live is saved 

00:00:39.960 --> 00:00:45.210
 large amount of energy for some reason 

00:00:42.750 --> 00:00:49.350
 no one got interested in the thought of how 

00:00:45.210 --> 00:00:52.410
 she got there himself put the question I 

00:00:49.350 --> 00:00:56.010
 I will answer it myself 

00:00:52.410 --> 00:00:58.760
 square meter surface closest to 

00:00:56.010 --> 00:01:04.070
 us the stars called the sun 

00:00:58.760 --> 00:01:07.140
 produces five kilowatts of energy 

00:01:04.070 --> 00:01:08.090
 every second is every square 

00:01:07.140 --> 00:01:11.240
 meter 

00:01:08.090 --> 00:01:16.110
 our sun you probably guessed not 

00:01:11.240 --> 00:01:18.119
 the only star in our galaxy and 

00:01:16.110 --> 00:01:23.070
 especially in our universe 

00:01:18.119 --> 00:01:24.509
 that's where they come from they don't they drink 

00:01:23.070 --> 00:01:27.390
 there is already a huge amount 

00:01:24.509 --> 00:01:30.299
 sources that are pumped 

00:01:27.390 --> 00:01:35.070
 energy aired by thermonuclear 

00:01:30.299 --> 00:01:39.829
 reactions taking place inside in depth 

00:01:35.070 --> 00:01:42.119
 all stars and even absorption 

00:01:39.829 --> 00:01:44.729
 ability that is absorbing 

00:01:42.119 --> 00:01:47.930
 intrusive black holes very 

00:01:44.729 --> 00:01:49.200
 slightly reduces the intensity 

00:01:47.930 --> 00:01:55.710
 pumping 

00:01:49.200 --> 00:01:57.979
 aether energy on this topic on the internet 

00:01:55.710 --> 00:02:04.770
 posted a fairly large number 

00:01:57.979 --> 00:02:08.039
 points of view of articles shooting practical 

00:02:04.770 --> 00:02:12.030
 States so as not to repeat others 

00:02:08.039 --> 00:02:14.209
 achievements which I respect a lot 

00:02:12.030 --> 00:02:17.940
 I consider it appropriate to share with you 

00:02:14.209 --> 00:02:22.040
 thoughts and ideas about what's in 

00:02:17.940 --> 00:02:24.480
 the Internet is not expressed very many people 

00:02:22.040 --> 00:02:25.310
 very many may even be possible to take 

00:02:24.480 --> 00:02:29.060
 in quotes 

00:02:25.310 --> 00:02:31.910
 declare that they are faced with real 

00:02:29.060 --> 00:02:36.360
 unidentified flying objects 

00:02:31.910 --> 00:02:40.530
 flying floating crawling and and so 

00:02:36.360 --> 00:02:43.470
 further it is not miracles by the way on this subject 

00:02:40.530 --> 00:02:46.799
 such a not boring good thought wonders 

00:02:43.470 --> 00:02:51.720
 not contrary to nature itself, but only 

00:02:46.799 --> 00:02:59.750
 what we know about her for now 

00:02:51.720 --> 00:03:04.430
 based on observations of the movement of the UFO 

00:02:59.750 --> 00:03:08.880
 being physicists and having common sense 

00:03:04.430 --> 00:03:11.760
 I do not think I'm sure that I managed 

00:03:08.880 --> 00:03:14.459
 understand what physical principles 

00:03:11.760 --> 00:03:15.680
 accessible to our understanding is happening 

00:03:14.459 --> 00:03:18.329
 this movement 

00:03:15.680 --> 00:03:23.280
 incomprehensible to us while we call 

00:03:18.329 --> 00:03:25.889
 unidentified flying objects there are two 

00:03:23.280 --> 00:03:28.680
 ways of moving material bodies in 

00:03:25.889 --> 00:03:33.750
 space mankind is still 

00:03:28.680 --> 00:03:36.209
 enjoy one of them discarding with 

00:03:33.750 --> 00:03:43.880
 fast mass burned 

00:03:36.209 --> 00:03:46.519
 fuel back thereby humanity 

00:03:43.880 --> 00:03:48.299
 designers and engineers will issue 

00:03:46.519 --> 00:03:50.040
 makes the body itself 

00:03:48.299 --> 00:03:53.209
 the source of these gases move 

00:03:50.040 --> 00:03:56.980
 opposite side forward 

00:03:53.209 --> 00:03:59.630
 an ordinary law is being implemented 

00:03:56.980 --> 00:04:04.970
 inertia ie conservation 

00:03:59.630 --> 00:04:06.550
 center of mass of the fuel with a small 

00:04:04.970 --> 00:04:08.000
 weight with a very high speed 

00:04:06.550 --> 00:04:10.730
 thrown back 

00:04:08.000 --> 00:04:16.870
 large massive body with less 

00:04:10.730 --> 00:04:19.930
 speed moves forward remember that 

00:04:16.870 --> 00:04:21.769
 makes us move to achieve 

00:04:19.930 --> 00:04:24.710
 our goal 

00:04:21.769 --> 00:04:27.640
 even if no one pushes behind it and 

00:04:24.710 --> 00:04:31.970
 interest that is, we ourselves are moving forward 

00:04:27.640 --> 00:04:33.410
 in this regard, no less right to 

00:04:31.970 --> 00:04:36.560
 existence has 

00:04:33.410 --> 00:04:41.240
 and the opposite way of moving in 

00:04:36.560 --> 00:04:43.930
 unlike reactive this create in 

00:04:41.240 --> 00:04:47.650
 direction of movement desired 

00:04:43.930 --> 00:04:51.500
 lower ether density when 

00:04:47.650 --> 00:04:54.230
 around and at the back layers 

00:04:51.500 --> 00:04:58.840
 the ether will literally push it 

00:04:54.230 --> 00:05:00.680
 the body is much more profitable than 

00:04:58.840 --> 00:05:03.710
 throw something back 

00:05:00.680 --> 00:05:05.570
 why because less density 

00:05:03.710 --> 00:05:08.690
 ether in the same direction 

00:05:05.570 --> 00:05:10.720
 desirable movement dramatically reduces 

00:05:08.690 --> 00:05:13.460
 resistance to movement 

00:05:10.720 --> 00:05:17.210
 you probably know that 

00:05:13.460 --> 00:05:19.190
 linings of supersonic aircraft with 

00:05:17.210 --> 00:05:21.050
 supersonic motion 

00:05:19.190 --> 00:05:26.270
 warms up to very high 

00:05:21.050 --> 00:05:30.440
 temperatures and misconceptions about 

00:05:26.270 --> 00:05:33.350
 the increase in mass due to the increase 

00:05:30.440 --> 00:05:36.440
 driving speed remember m equals x 

00:05:33.350 --> 00:05:39.320
 m 0 divided by the root of the unit minus 

00:05:36.440 --> 00:05:41.990
 allotted to a cent squared this 

00:05:39.320 --> 00:05:45.530
 famous formula attributed 

00:05:41.990 --> 00:05:48.200
 Einstein which is really clever 

00:05:45.530 --> 00:05:51.830
 stole away from Henri Poincare 

00:05:48.200 --> 00:05:53.960
 but they stuck like dots 

00:05:51.830 --> 00:05:58.160
 view you are input with increasing speed 

00:05:53.960 --> 00:06:00.280
 movement mass does not increase approximately 

00:05:58.160 --> 00:06:04.330
 proportional to the cube of speed 

00:06:00.280 --> 00:06:08.170
 medium resistance increases 

00:06:04.330 --> 00:06:12.110
 which body moves 

00:06:08.170 --> 00:06:14.810
 that's what we call a vacuum is just 

00:06:12.110 --> 00:06:17.930
 ether blank 

00:06:14.810 --> 00:06:24.190
 unlike the atmosphere of water and stone 

00:06:17.930 --> 00:06:28.150
 metal and so on what is noticed 

00:06:24.190 --> 00:06:32.320
 eyewitnesses ufo watchers at his 

00:06:28.150 --> 00:06:36.110
 maneuvering before sharp acceleration 

00:06:32.320 --> 00:06:36.890
 UFO she necessarily begins to glow 

00:06:36.110 --> 00:06:40.760
 at first 

00:06:36.890 --> 00:06:45.940
 es-03 and then a glow appears and 

00:06:40.760 --> 00:06:49.790
 around this material body this 

00:06:45.940 --> 00:06:55.460
 indirect evidence that inside 

00:06:49.790 --> 00:06:57.070
 UFO artificial need for his crew 

00:06:55.460 --> 00:07:02.780
 in a way 

00:06:57.070 --> 00:07:04.670
 the density of the ether is changing before we do this 

00:07:02.780 --> 00:07:07.720
 material topics in the direction of 

00:07:04.670 --> 00:07:12.010
 desirable movement of the density of the ether 

00:07:07.720 --> 00:07:17.330
 decreases on what energy is consumed 

00:07:12.010 --> 00:07:21.730
 derived from the surrounding ether is not 

00:07:17.330 --> 00:07:26.350
 from fuel tanks so the stock 

00:07:21.730 --> 00:07:29.560
 energy for aircraft 

00:07:26.350 --> 00:07:32.570
 interstellar interplanetary flight 

00:07:29.560 --> 00:07:36.890
 virtually limitless because these 

00:07:32.570 --> 00:07:38.630
 objects bathe in the sea of ether energy 

00:07:36.890 --> 00:07:41.450
 which they understand and can 

00:07:38.630 --> 00:07:48.640
 use unlike our academy 

00:07:41.450 --> 00:07:48.640
 Sciences let's quietly turn off
