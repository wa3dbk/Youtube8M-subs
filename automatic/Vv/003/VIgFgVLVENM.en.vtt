00:00:04.570 --> 00:00:09.700
 hello and welcome to wing for metro in 

00:00:07.330 --> 00:00:13.270
 where today we are going to perform an analysis 

00:00:09.700 --> 00:00:15.580
 more detailed than to the number 735 

00:00:13.270 --> 00:00:17.619
 then doing a comparison of 

00:00:15.580 --> 00:00:19.260
 performance with a terminal that you have 

00:00:17.619 --> 00:00:24.670
 requested as can be the nokia lumia 

00:00:19.260 --> 00:00:27.039
 920 the idea is to start 

00:00:24.670 --> 00:00:29.980
 different applications and check then 

00:00:27.039 --> 00:00:32.349
 how much time do we see that it takes to load 

00:00:29.980 --> 00:00:35.640
 in each one for it for example let's 

00:00:32.349 --> 00:00:35.640
 to use skype 

00:00:39.200 --> 00:00:44.000
 we want times are 

00:00:41.720 --> 00:00:47.120
 practically the same is more takes a 

00:00:44.000 --> 00:00:49.400
 little less to boot in 920 but in 

00:00:47.120 --> 00:00:52.560
 connect to the network takes a little less 

00:00:49.400 --> 00:00:57.380
 of 735 

00:00:52.560 --> 00:00:57.380
 if we perform a next load 

00:00:57.640 --> 00:01:01.380
 we see that they are practically the same 

00:01:01.940 --> 00:01:05.379
 we can try whatsapp 

00:01:06.670 --> 00:01:11.759
 We think it's a little faster than 

00:01:08.759 --> 00:01:11.759
 735 

00:01:12.380 --> 00:01:20.759
 and we can make a new charge 

00:01:16.810 --> 00:01:23.290
 and again it's a little faster than 735 

00:01:20.759 --> 00:01:24.909
 another one of the heavy applications or with 

00:01:23.290 --> 00:01:27.659
 many can use the users 

00:01:24.909 --> 00:01:27.659
 it can be facebook 

00:01:31.130 --> 00:01:35.670
 that again is a little faster the 

00:01:33.729 --> 00:01:38.509
 735 

00:01:35.670 --> 00:01:38.509
 as you can see 

00:01:40.390 --> 00:01:44.700
 we can also use the application 

00:01:42.250 --> 00:01:44.700
 weather 

00:01:50.170 --> 00:01:53.590
 and now for example after having 

00:01:51.759 --> 00:01:55.689
 used to several we can say let's 

00:01:53.590 --> 00:01:57.250
 boot again to skype to see how it 

00:01:55.689 --> 00:02:00.310
 behaves with the theme of management of 

00:01:57.250 --> 00:02:03.509
 memory then we see that the restoration 

00:02:00.310 --> 00:02:03.509
 it's practically instantaneous 

00:02:03.540 --> 00:02:10.090
 let's see whatsapp 

00:02:06.550 --> 00:02:13.709
 we have practically the same 

00:02:10.090 --> 00:02:13.709
 and for example with facebook 

00:02:15.560 --> 00:02:21.230
 another one of the applications quite 

00:02:17.800 --> 00:02:24.890
 heavy and good that we can use in 

00:02:21.230 --> 00:02:27.430
 the maps with which he still knows how to 

00:02:24.890 --> 00:02:27.430
 it can behave 

00:02:39.360 --> 00:02:45.000
 as we can see the performance is 

00:02:41.220 --> 00:02:48.870
 practically the same as the 920 with 

00:02:45.000 --> 00:02:52.290
 with respect to 700 35 

00:02:48.870 --> 00:02:54.569
 which is good because it says a lot about this 

00:02:52.290 --> 00:02:58.760
 terminal selected 35 mostly by 

00:02:54.569 --> 00:02:58.760
 its price quite content
