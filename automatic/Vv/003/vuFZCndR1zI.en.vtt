to do is quite dirty but I'm going to

00:00:23.770 --> 00:00:26.460 
to do is quite dirty but I'm going to
put<00:00:24.039> charcoal<00:00:24.849> in<00:00:25.000> the<00:00:25.090> bottom<00:00:25.360> of<00:00:25.449> this<00:00:25.599> this

00:00:26.460 --> 00:00:26.470 
put charcoal in the bottom of this this

00:00:26.470 --> 00:00:27.929 
put charcoal in the bottom of this this
is<00:00:26.590> the<00:00:26.680> perfect<00:00:27.009> filter<00:00:27.189> it<00:00:27.400> was<00:00:27.520> designed<00:00:27.880> to

00:00:27.929 --> 00:00:27.939 
is the perfect filter it was designed to

00:00:27.939 --> 00:00:30.479 
is the perfect filter it was designed to
be<00:00:28.090> a<00:00:28.119> filter<00:00:28.570> so<00:00:28.840> this<00:00:29.800> is<00:00:29.949> going<00:00:30.160> to<00:00:30.250> be<00:00:30.340> my

00:00:30.479 --> 00:00:30.489 
be a filter so this is going to be my

00:00:30.489 --> 00:00:33.750 
be a filter so this is going to be my
rain<00:00:30.699> water<00:00:31.050> filter<00:00:32.050> system<00:00:32.200> later<00:00:32.559> on<00:00:32.760> and

00:00:33.750 --> 00:00:33.760 
rain water filter system later on and

00:00:33.760 --> 00:00:34.979 
rain water filter system later on and
then<00:00:33.940> I'll<00:00:34.030> be<00:00:34.149> able<00:00:34.180> to<00:00:34.329> drink<00:00:34.570> it<00:00:34.690> straight

00:00:34.979 --> 00:00:34.989 
then I'll be able to drink it straight

00:00:34.989 --> 00:00:38.610 
then I'll be able to drink it straight
out<00:00:35.700> but<00:00:36.700> I'm<00:00:37.570> going<00:00:37.780> to<00:00:37.840> put<00:00:38.020> charcoal<00:00:38.410> in<00:00:38.559> the

00:00:38.610 --> 00:00:38.620 
out but I'm going to put charcoal in the

00:00:38.620 --> 00:00:40.950 
out but I'm going to put charcoal in the
bottom<00:00:38.950> I<00:00:39.039> have<00:00:39.219> all<00:00:39.940> natural<00:00:40.420> wood<00:00:40.570> charcoal

00:00:40.950 --> 00:00:40.960 
bottom I have all natural wood charcoal

00:00:40.960 --> 00:00:44.729 
bottom I have all natural wood charcoal
grind<00:00:41.440> up<00:00:41.649> and<00:00:41.890> then<00:00:42.879> I<00:00:42.910> have<00:00:43.180> some<00:00:43.739> filter

00:00:44.729 --> 00:00:44.739 
grind up and then I have some filter

00:00:44.739 --> 00:00:47.340 
grind up and then I have some filter
sand<00:00:44.949> I<00:00:45.250> have<00:00:45.520> two<00:00:45.760> different<00:00:45.969> grades<00:00:46.870> of<00:00:47.079> sand

00:00:47.340 --> 00:00:47.350 
sand I have two different grades of sand

00:00:47.350 --> 00:00:49.410 
sand I have two different grades of sand
coarse<00:00:48.010> will<00:00:48.250> go<00:00:48.370> down<00:00:48.520> first<00:00:48.790> and<00:00:49.000> the<00:00:49.090> final

00:00:49.410 --> 00:00:49.420 
coarse will go down first and the final

00:00:49.420 --> 00:00:53.100 
coarse will go down first and the final
go<00:00:49.540> on<00:00:49.630> top<00:00:51.000> and<00:00:52.000> of<00:00:52.120> course<00:00:52.300> I<00:00:52.420> could<00:00:52.600> fill

00:00:53.100 --> 00:00:53.110 
go on top and of course I could fill

00:00:53.110 --> 00:00:55.979 
go on top and of course I could fill
that<00:00:53.790> to<00:00:54.790> keep<00:00:55.000> it<00:00:55.120> from<00:00:55.300> settling<00:00:55.510> in<00:00:55.810> through

00:00:55.979 --> 00:00:55.989 
that to keep it from settling in through

00:00:55.989 --> 00:00:59.540 
that to keep it from settling in through
the<00:00:56.110> charcoal<00:00:56.560> and<00:00:56.590> in<00:00:56.860> through<00:00:57.040> the<00:00:57.190> filter

00:00:59.540 --> 00:00:59.550 
the charcoal and in through the filter

00:00:59.550 --> 00:01:01.950 
the charcoal and in through the filter
eventually<00:01:00.550> that<00:01:00.760> that<00:01:01.120> swimming<00:01:01.840> pool

00:01:01.950 --> 00:01:01.960 
eventually that that swimming pool

00:01:01.960 --> 00:01:03.569 
eventually that that swimming pool
filter<00:01:02.530> will<00:01:02.680> be<00:01:02.710> stuck<00:01:03.040> here<00:01:03.070> them<00:01:03.370> in<00:01:03.520> the

00:01:03.569 --> 00:01:03.579 
filter will be stuck here them in the

00:01:03.579 --> 00:01:06.480 
filter will be stuck here them in the
middle<00:01:03.850> between<00:01:04.210> my<00:01:04.680> water<00:01:05.680> collector<00:01:06.250> on<00:01:06.369> the

00:01:06.480 --> 00:01:06.490 
middle between my water collector on the

00:01:06.490 --> 00:01:11.130 
middle between my water collector on the
roof<00:01:06.700> and<00:01:07.200> the<00:01:08.200> water<00:01:08.409> tank<00:01:08.829> down<00:01:09.100> here<00:01:10.110> so<00:01:11.110> I

00:01:11.130 --> 00:01:11.140 
roof and the water tank down here so I

00:01:11.140 --> 00:01:12.630 
roof and the water tank down here so I
will<00:01:11.290> have<00:01:11.560> the<00:01:11.710> swimming<00:01:12.070> pool<00:01:12.219> filter

00:01:12.630 --> 00:01:12.640 
will have the swimming pool filter

00:01:12.640 --> 00:01:14.130 
will have the swimming pool filter
somewhere<00:01:12.909> right<00:01:13.210> about<00:01:13.329> here<00:01:13.479> in<00:01:13.810> the<00:01:13.869> middle

00:01:14.130 --> 00:01:14.140 
somewhere right about here in the middle

00:01:14.140 --> 00:01:16.620 
somewhere right about here in the middle
and<00:01:14.469> that<00:01:15.430> will<00:01:15.610> filter<00:01:15.850> through<00:01:16.000> and<00:01:16.390> drain

00:01:16.620 --> 00:01:16.630 
and that will filter through and drain

00:01:16.630 --> 00:01:18.539 
and that will filter through and drain
into<00:01:16.960> the<00:01:17.079> tank<00:01:17.350> and<00:01:17.590> then<00:01:17.680> I'll<00:01:17.829> have<00:01:18.040> pure

00:01:18.539 --> 00:01:18.549 
into the tank and then I'll have pure

00:01:18.549 --> 00:01:23.069 
into the tank and then I'll have pure
drinking<00:01:18.939> water<00:01:19.119> from<00:01:19.329> there<00:01:21.689> now<00:01:22.689> when<00:01:22.899> they

00:01:23.069 --> 00:01:23.079 
drinking water from there now when they

00:01:23.079 --> 00:01:26.480 
drinking water from there now when they
when<00:01:23.979> the<00:01:24.100> trailers<00:01:24.549> tanks<00:01:24.969> are<00:01:25.119> empty<00:01:25.420> I<00:01:25.479> have

00:01:26.480 --> 00:01:26.490 
when the trailers tanks are empty I have
