let you know how that works notice that
I<00:00:55.220> starting<00:00:55.430> to<00:00:55.520> float<00:00:55.700> in<00:00:55.820> there<00:00:55.970> that's<00:00:56.630> what

00:00:56.770 --> 00:00:56.780 
I starting to float in there that's what

00:00:56.780 --> 00:00:59.410 
I starting to float in there that's what
you<00:00:56.900> want<00:00:57.140> okay<00:00:57.890> that<00:00:58.400> was<00:00:58.520> a<00:00:58.550> safety<00:00:59.060> tips

here<00:00:59.600> when<00:00:59.750> you<00:00:59.810> got<00:00:59.930> hot<00:01:00.140> oil<00:01:00.350> on<00:01:00.530> the<00:01:00.620> stove's

00:01:00.850 --> 00:01:00.860 
here when you got hot oil on the stove's

00:01:00.860 --> 00:01:02.770 
here when you got hot oil on the stove's
you<00:01:01.040> make<00:01:01.190> sure<00:01:01.340> you<00:01:01.460> don't<00:01:01.640> run<00:01:01.850> away<00:01:02.420> from<00:01:02.540> it

00:01:02.770 --> 00:01:02.780 
you make sure you don't run away from it

00:01:02.780 --> 00:01:04.329 
you make sure you don't run away from it
it's<00:01:03.080> really<00:01:03.320> not<00:01:03.440> a<00:01:03.500> good<00:01:03.830> thing<00:01:04.009> anything

00:01:04.329 --> 00:01:04.339 
it's really not a good thing anything

00:01:04.339 --> 00:01:06.219 
it's really not a good thing anything
like<00:01:04.790> this<00:01:04.970> for<00:01:05.180> instance<00:01:05.269> is<00:01:05.630> a<00:01:05.659> pot<00:01:05.990> that

00:01:06.219 --> 00:01:06.229 
like this for instance is a pot that

00:01:06.229 --> 00:01:07.719 
like this for instance is a pot that
really<00:01:06.530> encloses<00:01:07.100> the<00:01:07.159> heat<00:01:07.400> really<00:01:07.610> well

00:01:07.719 --> 00:01:07.729 
really encloses the heat really well

00:01:07.729 --> 00:01:09.670 
really encloses the heat really well
notice<00:01:08.420> there's<00:01:08.750> a<00:01:08.810> big<00:01:09.020> difference<00:01:09.259> in<00:01:09.619> how

00:01:09.670 --> 00:01:09.680 
notice there's a big difference in how

00:01:09.680 --> 00:01:12.520 
notice there's a big difference in how
low<00:01:10.370> the<00:01:10.580> temporal<00:01:11.330> is<00:01:11.840> compared<00:01:12.170> to<00:01:12.260> the<00:01:12.350> pot

00:01:12.520 --> 00:01:12.530 
low the temporal is compared to the pot

00:01:12.530 --> 00:01:14.290 
low the temporal is compared to the pot
just<00:01:13.010> a<00:01:13.070> lot<00:01:13.190> safer<00:01:13.460> like<00:01:13.760> that<00:01:13.970> okay<00:01:14.240> so

00:01:14.290 --> 00:01:14.300 
just a lot safer like that okay so

00:01:14.300 --> 00:01:15.400 
just a lot safer like that okay so
anything<00:01:14.570> with<00:01:14.660> the<00:01:14.720> taller<00:01:14.930> sides<00:01:15.200> are

00:01:15.400 --> 00:01:15.410 
anything with the taller sides are

00:01:15.410 --> 00:01:17.050 
anything with the taller sides are
better<00:01:15.530> out<00:01:15.710> to<00:01:15.860> go<00:01:16.010> definitely<00:01:16.640> okay<00:01:17.000> so

00:01:17.050 --> 00:01:17.060 
better out to go definitely okay so

00:01:17.060 --> 00:01:18.730 
better out to go definitely okay so
we've<00:01:17.300> got<00:01:17.450> those<00:01:17.660> Donuts<00:01:18.080> cooking<00:01:18.470> how<00:01:18.590> are

you'll get it nice and golden brown on
the<00:03:01.730> outside<00:03:01.760> but<00:03:02.299> then<00:03:02.419> the<00:03:02.510> inside<00:03:02.900> will<00:03:03.079> be

00:03:03.159 --> 00:03:03.169 
the outside but then the inside will be

00:03:03.169 --> 00:03:05.860 
the outside but then the inside will be
doughy<00:03:03.470> won't<00:03:04.010> taste<00:03:04.280> very<00:03:04.459> good<00:03:04.700> okay<00:03:05.480> so<00:03:05.540> not

00:03:05.860 --> 00:03:05.870 
doughy won't taste very good okay so not

00:03:05.870 --> 00:03:07.929 
doughy won't taste very good okay so not
too<00:03:06.049> thick<00:03:06.349> not<00:03:06.620> too<00:03:06.680> solid<00:03:07.220> so<00:03:07.639> that's<00:03:07.819> why

00:03:07.929 --> 00:03:07.939 
too thick not too solid so that's why
