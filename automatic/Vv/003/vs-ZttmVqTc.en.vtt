did it kid John I'm like Archie Steven
Pitts<00:01:53.159> I<00:01:53.369> mean<00:01:53.520> it<00:01:53.670> was<00:01:53.790> it<00:01:53.970> was<00:01:54.090> just<00:01:54.240> you<00:01:54.509> know

00:01:54.530 --> 00:01:54.540 
Pitts I mean it was it was just you know

00:01:54.540 --> 00:01:56.970 
Pitts I mean it was it was just you know
if<00:01:54.689> one<00:01:54.840> went<00:01:55.049> down<00:01:55.140> the<00:01:55.409> other<00:01:55.530> one's<00:01:55.710> tough

00:01:56.970 --> 00:01:56.980 
if one went down the other one's tough

00:01:56.980 --> 00:01:59.220 
if one went down the other one's tough
and<00:01:57.250> it's<00:01:57.850> it's<00:01:58.210> good<00:01:58.450> to<00:01:58.570> see<00:01:58.780> that<00:01:58.810> you<00:01:59.110> know

00:01:59.220 --> 00:01:59.230 
and it's it's good to see that you know

00:01:59.230 --> 00:02:01.470 
and it's it's good to see that you know
there's<00:01:59.710> the<00:02:00.370> next<00:02:00.610> great<00:02:00.850> when<00:02:01.030> it<00:02:01.150> keeps<00:02:01.330> on

00:02:01.470 --> 00:02:01.480 
there's the next great when it keeps on

00:02:01.480 --> 00:02:03.860 
there's the next great when it keeps on
coming<00:02:01.510> and<00:02:01.870> we're<00:02:02.500> getting<00:02:02.620> back<00:02:02.950> into<00:02:03.220> the

00:02:03.860 --> 00:02:03.870 
coming and we're getting back into the

00:02:03.870 --> 00:02:06.450 
coming and we're getting back into the
Penn<00:02:04.870> State<00:02:05.020> you<00:02:05.380> know<00:02:05.500> the<00:02:05.650> linebacker<00:02:06.160> you

00:02:06.450 --> 00:02:06.460 
Penn State you know the linebacker you

00:02:06.460 --> 00:02:09.359 
Penn State you know the linebacker you
one<00:02:06.970> after<00:02:07.330> another<00:02:07.360> after<00:02:07.900> another<00:02:08.170> and<00:02:08.649> it's

00:02:09.359 --> 00:02:09.369 
one after another after another and it's

00:02:09.369 --> 00:02:11.400 
one after another after another and it's
great<00:02:09.640> to<00:02:09.820> see<00:02:10.000> I<00:02:10.300> think<00:02:10.810> that<00:02:10.960> you<00:02:11.110> know<00:02:11.230> as<00:02:11.290> we

00:02:11.400 --> 00:02:11.410 
great to see I think that you know as we

00:02:11.410 --> 00:02:13.140 
great to see I think that you know as we
go<00:02:11.560> back<00:02:11.800> and<00:02:12.070> look<00:02:12.250> at<00:02:12.400> the<00:02:12.460> undefeated<00:02:13.000> team

00:02:13.140 --> 00:02:13.150 
go back and look at the undefeated team

00:02:13.150 --> 00:02:15.600 
go back and look at the undefeated team
in<00:02:13.180> 1994<00:02:14.140> I<00:02:14.170> still<00:02:14.590> consider<00:02:14.800> at<00:02:15.130> the<00:02:15.220> national

00:02:15.600 --> 00:02:15.610 
in 1994 I still consider at the national

00:02:15.610 --> 00:02:17.040 
in 1994 I still consider at the national
champion<00:02:16.000> and<00:02:16.120> I<00:02:16.180> think<00:02:16.390> rightfully<00:02:16.630> than

00:02:17.040 --> 00:02:17.050 
champion and I think rightfully than

00:02:17.050 --> 00:02:18.330 
champion and I think rightfully than
anybody<00:02:17.380> the<00:02:17.530> played<00:02:17.740> on<00:02:17.920> that<00:02:18.070> team<00:02:18.130> should

00:02:18.330 --> 00:02:18.340 
anybody the played on that team should

00:02:18.340 --> 00:02:20.940 
anybody the played on that team should
think<00:02:18.820> that<00:02:19.000> it<00:02:19.600> was<00:02:19.840> such<00:02:20.140> a<00:02:20.380> prolific

00:02:20.940 --> 00:02:20.950 
think that it was such a prolific

00:02:20.950 --> 00:02:22.860 
think that it was such a prolific
offense<00:02:21.610> that<00:02:21.880> the<00:02:22.030> defense<00:02:22.450> kind<00:02:22.690> of<00:02:22.780> got

00:02:22.860 --> 00:02:22.870 
offense that the defense kind of got

00:02:22.870 --> 00:02:24.390 
offense that the defense kind of got
overshadowed<00:02:23.140> a<00:02:23.620> little<00:02:23.830> bit<00:02:23.980> you<00:02:24.190> were<00:02:24.280> on

00:02:24.390 --> 00:02:24.400 
overshadowed a little bit you were on

00:02:24.400 --> 00:02:25.650 
overshadowed a little bit you were on
the<00:02:24.520> field<00:02:24.670> so<00:02:24.910> much<00:02:24.940> because<00:02:25.330> these<00:02:25.480> guys

00:02:25.650 --> 00:02:25.660 
the field so much because these guys

00:02:25.660 --> 00:02:27.780 
the field so much because these guys
scored<00:02:26.110> about<00:02:26.350> every<00:02:26.650> minute<00:02:26.920> a<00:02:26.950> half<00:02:27.250> and

00:02:27.780 --> 00:02:27.790 
scored about every minute a half and

00:02:27.790 --> 00:02:30.030 
scored about every minute a half and
back<00:02:28.030> ok<00:02:28.390> why<00:02:28.690> don't<00:02:28.750> you<00:02:28.930> go<00:02:29.050> again<00:02:29.350> and<00:02:29.890> then

00:02:30.030 --> 00:02:30.040 
back ok why don't you go again and then

00:02:30.040 --> 00:02:32.940 
back ok why don't you go again and then
Kenny<00:02:30.310> would<00:02:30.490> yell<00:02:30.670> oh<00:02:31.590> can<00:02:32.590> you<00:02:32.680> stop

00:02:32.940 --> 00:02:32.950 
Kenny would yell oh can you stop

00:02:32.950 --> 00:02:37.440 
Kenny would yell oh can you stop
somebody<00:02:34.080> but<00:02:35.190> it<00:02:36.190> was<00:02:36.280> it<00:02:36.790> was<00:02:36.910> it<00:02:37.090> was<00:02:37.209> tough

00:02:37.440 --> 00:02:37.450 
somebody but it was it was it was tough

00:02:37.450 --> 00:02:44.090 
somebody but it was it was it was tough
I<00:02:37.660> mean<00:02:37.690> we<00:02:38.170> would<00:02:38.580> we<00:02:39.580> would<00:02:39.870> they'd<00:02:40.870> score

00:02:44.090 --> 00:02:44.100 

00:02:44.100 --> 00:02:49.530 

and<00:02:45.100> then<00:02:45.930> the<00:02:46.930> other<00:02:47.050> team<00:02:47.200> would<00:02:47.320> score<00:02:48.540> then

00:02:49.530 --> 00:02:49.540 
and then the other team would score then

00:02:49.540 --> 00:02:57.090 
and then the other team would score then
we<00:02:49.660> get<00:02:49.780> the<00:02:49.900> ball<00:02:50.020> back<00:02:50.200> they'd<00:02:50.410> score<00:02:56.100> 4045

00:02:57.090 --> 00:02:57.100 
we get the ball back they'd score 4045

00:02:57.100 --> 00:02:59.940 
we get the ball back they'd score 4045
and<00:02:57.780> just<00:02:58.780> I<00:02:58.990> think<00:02:59.050> that<00:02:59.350> defense<00:02:59.770> was

00:02:59.940 --> 00:02:59.950 
and just I think that defense was

00:02:59.950 --> 00:03:02.009 
and just I think that defense was
somewhat<00:03:00.310> underrated<00:03:00.970> simply<00:03:01.420> because<00:03:01.750> you

00:03:02.009 --> 00:03:02.019 
somewhat underrated simply because you

00:03:02.019 --> 00:03:03.479 
somewhat underrated simply because you
know<00:03:02.140> again<00:03:02.500> you're<00:03:02.739> overshadowed<00:03:03.370> by

00:03:03.479 --> 00:03:03.489 
know again you're overshadowed by

00:03:03.489 --> 00:03:05.790 
know again you're overshadowed by
offense<00:03:03.940> but<00:03:04.209> that<00:03:04.870> defense<00:03:05.320> that<00:03:05.410> you're<00:03:05.650> had

00:03:05.790 --> 00:03:05.800 
offense but that defense that you're had

00:03:05.800 --> 00:03:07.140 
offense but that defense that you're had
to<00:03:05.890> withstand<00:03:06.070> a<00:03:06.370> lot<00:03:06.519> of<00:03:06.670> injuries<00:03:07.000> they

00:03:07.140 --> 00:03:07.150 
to withstand a lot of injuries they

00:03:07.150 --> 00:03:08.940 
to withstand a lot of injuries they
cycled<00:03:07.810> some<00:03:07.959> guys<00:03:08.140> through<00:03:08.500> a<00:03:08.530> little<00:03:08.800> bit

00:03:08.940 --> 00:03:08.950 
cycled some guys through a little bit

00:03:08.950 --> 00:03:12.030 
cycled some guys through a little bit
and<00:03:09.269> and<00:03:10.269> I<00:03:10.450> just<00:03:10.480> think<00:03:10.959> that<00:03:11.080> defensively

00:03:12.030 --> 00:03:12.040 
and and I just think that defensively

00:03:12.040 --> 00:03:14.790 
and and I just think that defensively
Brian<00:03:12.430> that<00:03:12.670> team<00:03:12.959> was<00:03:13.959> underrated<00:03:14.410> simply

00:03:14.790 --> 00:03:14.800 
Brian that team was underrated simply

00:03:14.800 --> 00:03:17.040 
Brian that team was underrated simply
because<00:03:15.040> of<00:03:15.190> injury<00:03:15.550> I<00:03:15.760> don't<00:03:16.030> think<00:03:16.180> if<00:03:16.870> you

00:03:17.040 --> 00:03:17.050 
because of injury I don't think if you

00:03:17.050 --> 00:03:20.009 
because of injury I don't think if you
look<00:03:17.260> at<00:03:17.350> that<00:03:17.620> team<00:03:17.890> when<00:03:18.280> I<00:03:18.340> played<00:03:18.900> you<00:03:19.900> know

00:03:20.009 --> 00:03:20.019 
look at that team when I played you know

00:03:20.019 --> 00:03:21.690 
look at that team when I played you know
Vinny<00:03:20.290> Stewart<00:03:20.650> had<00:03:20.769> gotten<00:03:20.980> her<00:03:21.250> Christmas

00:03:21.690 --> 00:03:21.700 
Vinny Stewart had gotten her Christmas

Vinny Stewart had gotten her Christmas

00:03:23.490 --> 00:03:23.500 
equus hurt and we had brain and Noble

00:03:23.500 --> 00:03:24.840 
equus hurt and we had brain and Noble

Atkins<00:03:32.200> who<00:03:32.350> was<00:03:32.470> younger<00:03:32.890> and<00:03:33.570> if<00:03:34.570> you<00:03:34.810> look

00:03:35.040 --> 00:03:35.050 
Atkins who was younger and if you look

00:03:35.050 --> 00:03:36.930 
Atkins who was younger and if you look

00:04:50.150 --> 00:04:50.160 
moment I remember being here in 1994 and

00:04:50.160 --> 00:04:51.980 
moment I remember being here in 1994 and
it's<00:04:50.310> one<00:04:50.460> of<00:04:50.550> the<00:04:50.610> most<00:04:50.990> perfect

00:04:51.980 --> 00:04:51.990 
it's one of the most perfect

performances that you could ever

00:04:53.610 --> 00:04:56.749 
performances that you could ever
possibly<00:04:53.970> see<00:04:54.660> the<00:04:55.199> 63<00:04:55.770> to<00:04:55.860> 14<00:04:56.280> went<00:04:56.490> against
