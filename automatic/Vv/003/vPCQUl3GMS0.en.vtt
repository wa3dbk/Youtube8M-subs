that I markable cop which I found to be

00:00:18.300 --> 00:00:21.410 
that I markable cop which I found to be
the<00:00:18.390> easiest<00:00:18.539> way<00:00:19.080> and<00:00:19.760> basically<00:00:20.760> I'm<00:00:21.119> going

00:00:21.410 --> 00:00:21.420 
the easiest way and basically I'm going

00:00:21.420 --> 00:00:26.120 
the easiest way and basically I'm going
to<00:00:21.570> be<00:00:21.810> doing<00:00:22.140> a<00:00:22.650> few<00:00:23.310> pages<00:00:23.900> off<00:00:24.900> the<00:00:25.529> basic

00:00:26.120 --> 00:00:26.130 
to be doing a few pages off the basic

00:00:26.130 --> 00:00:30.140 
to be doing a few pages off the basic
heart<00:00:26.689> which<00:00:27.689> is<00:00:27.720> in<00:00:28.019> the<00:00:28.170> files<00:00:28.439> under<00:00:29.340> free

00:00:30.140 --> 00:00:30.150 
heart which is in the files under free

00:00:30.150 --> 00:00:32.690 
heart which is in the files under free
basic<00:00:30.660> heart<00:00:30.929> level<00:00:31.140> one<00:00:31.529> by<00:00:31.890> Lindsey<00:00:32.489> Wright

00:00:32.690 --> 00:00:32.700 
basic heart level one by Lindsey Wright

00:00:32.700 --> 00:00:37.880 
basic heart level one by Lindsey Wright
and<00:00:33.329> if<00:00:34.290> my<00:00:35.280> son<00:00:35.340> just<00:00:35.790> shows<00:00:36.420> you<00:00:36.719> the<00:00:37.559> pattern

00:00:37.880 --> 00:00:37.890 
and if my son just shows you the pattern

00:00:37.890 --> 00:00:42.760 
and if my son just shows you the pattern
here<00:00:39.170> basic<00:00:40.170> play<00:00:40.440> it's<00:00:40.860> got<00:00:41.100> 41<00:00:41.610> foals<00:00:42.149> in<00:00:42.450> it

00:00:42.760 --> 00:00:42.770 
here basic play it's got 41 foals in it

00:00:42.770 --> 00:00:45.889 
here basic play it's got 41 foals in it
so<00:00:43.770> you<00:00:43.829> need<00:00:44.100> eight<00:00:44.370> to<00:00:44.700> two<00:00:44.910> pages<00:00:45.270> and

00:00:45.889 --> 00:00:45.899 
so you need eight to two pages and

00:00:45.899 --> 00:00:49.250 
so you need eight to two pages and
obviously<00:00:46.350> a<00:00:46.469> book<00:00:46.829> that<00:00:47.700> is<00:00:47.850> at<00:00:48.059> least<00:00:48.260> 20

00:00:49.250 --> 00:00:49.260 
obviously a book that is at least 20

00:00:49.260 --> 00:00:52.790 
obviously a book that is at least 20
centimeters<00:00:50.219> in<00:00:50.579> height<00:00:50.780> but<00:00:51.780> is<00:00:51.930> from<00:00:52.230> top<00:00:52.559> to

00:00:52.790 --> 00:00:52.800 
centimeters in height but is from top to

00:00:52.800 --> 00:00:53.569 
centimeters in height but is from top to
bottom

00:00:53.569 --> 00:00:53.579 
bottom

00:00:53.579 --> 00:00:58.220 
bottom
and<00:00:53.870> over<00:00:54.870> here<00:00:55.820> that<00:00:56.820> basically<00:00:57.059> tells<00:00:57.809> you

00:00:58.220 --> 00:00:58.230 
and over here that basically tells you

00:00:58.230 --> 00:01:01.490 
and over here that basically tells you
which<00:00:58.859> fold<00:00:59.670> you're<00:00:59.910> going<00:01:00.149> to<00:01:00.300> be<00:01:00.390> doing<00:01:00.600> not

00:01:01.490 --> 00:01:01.500 
which fold you're going to be doing not

00:01:01.500 --> 00:01:07.070 
which fold you're going to be doing not
the<00:01:01.530> page<00:01:02.010> number<00:01:02.690> because<00:01:03.690> a<00:01:04.880> page<00:01:05.880> has<00:01:06.330> two

00:01:07.070 --> 00:01:07.080 
the page number because a page has two

00:01:07.080 --> 00:01:09.530 
the page number because a page has two
numbers<00:01:07.590> one<00:01:07.890> on<00:01:08.040> one<00:01:08.250> side<00:01:08.549> you<00:01:09.030> flip<00:01:09.270> it<00:01:09.420> over

00:01:09.530 --> 00:01:09.540 
numbers one on one side you flip it over

00:01:09.540 --> 00:01:11.780 
numbers one on one side you flip it over
then<00:01:10.049> there's<00:01:10.260> another<00:01:10.470> number<00:01:10.710> so<00:01:11.130> these

00:01:11.780 --> 00:01:11.790 
then there's another number so these

00:01:11.790 --> 00:01:14.030 
then there's another number so these
here<00:01:12.119> are<00:01:12.180> the<00:01:12.510> folds<00:01:13.110> that<00:01:13.140> you<00:01:13.380> do<00:01:13.560> in<00:01:13.799> your

00:01:14.030 --> 00:01:14.040 
here are the folds that you do in your

00:01:14.040 --> 00:01:18.380 
here are the folds that you do in your
first<00:01:14.790> column<00:01:15.360> is<00:01:15.570> your<00:01:16.140> first<00:01:16.560> mark<00:01:16.979> and<00:01:17.460> this

marking your book you don't move your
ruler<00:01:26.340> so<00:01:26.970> basic<00:01:27.509> play<00:01:27.720> you<00:01:27.990> put<00:01:28.200> it<00:01:28.290> on<00:01:28.409> your

00:01:28.580 --> 00:01:28.590 
ruler so basic play you put it on your

00:01:28.590 --> 00:01:31.219 
ruler so basic play you put it on your
paper<00:01:28.770> with<00:01:29.369> the<00:01:29.640> zero<00:01:30.030> if<00:01:30.659> you're<00:01:30.900> reading

00:01:31.219 --> 00:01:31.229 
paper with the zero if you're reading

00:01:31.229 --> 00:01:36.590 
paper with the zero if you're reading
your<00:01:31.350> book<00:01:31.590> and<00:01:33.350> you<00:01:34.350> basically<00:01:35.420> flip<00:01:36.420> it

00:01:36.590 --> 00:01:36.600 
your book and you basically flip it

00:01:36.600 --> 00:01:41.569 
your book and you basically flip it
anti-clockwise<00:01:38.180> so<00:01:39.180> the<00:01:39.990> writing<00:01:40.259> is<00:01:40.920> facing

00:01:41.569 --> 00:01:41.579 
anti-clockwise so the writing is facing

00:01:41.579 --> 00:01:46.069 
anti-clockwise so the writing is facing
downwards<00:01:43.490> get<00:01:44.490> your<00:01:44.670> ruler<00:01:45.090> obviously<00:01:45.840> is

00:01:46.069 --> 00:01:46.079 
downwards get your ruler obviously is

00:01:46.079 --> 00:01:49.300 
downwards get your ruler obviously is
zero<00:01:46.409> put<00:01:46.920> it<00:01:47.040> at<00:01:47.159> the<00:01:47.310> top<00:01:47.520> of<00:01:47.700> your<00:01:47.729> book<00:01:48.060> I

00:01:49.300 --> 00:01:49.310 
zero put it at the top of your book I

00:01:49.310 --> 00:01:53.660 
zero put it at the top of your book I
found<00:01:50.310> that<00:01:51.240> it's<00:01:51.720> better<00:01:51.990> not<00:01:52.979> to<00:01:53.040> mark<00:01:53.460> your

00:01:53.660 --> 00:01:53.670 
found that it's better not to mark your

00:01:53.670 --> 00:01:56.300 
found that it's better not to mark your
page<00:01:53.880> on<00:01:54.180> the<00:01:54.299> very<00:01:54.509> end<00:01:54.750> but<00:01:55.649> to<00:01:55.829> just<00:01:56.070> pull

00:01:56.300 --> 00:01:56.310 
page on the very end but to just pull

00:01:56.310 --> 00:01:58.850 
page on the very end but to just pull
your<00:01:56.460> ruler<00:01:56.670> down<00:01:57.000> a<00:01:57.030> little<00:01:57.299> bit<00:01:57.630> so<00:01:58.409> you're

00:01:58.850 --> 00:01:58.860 
your ruler down a little bit so you're

00:01:58.860 --> 00:02:00.560 
your ruler down a little bit so you're
giving<00:01:59.130> yourself<00:01:59.520> a<00:01:59.579> bit<00:01:59.729> a<00:01:59.759> leeway<00:02:00.149> so<00:02:00.180> when

00:02:00.560 --> 00:02:00.570 
giving yourself a bit a leeway so when

00:02:00.570 --> 00:02:03.440 
giving yourself a bit a leeway so when
you<00:02:00.689> fold<00:02:00.930> your<00:02:01.049> pages<00:02:01.490> you<00:02:02.490> can't<00:02:02.820> see<00:02:03.240> the

mark<00:02:25.109> the<00:02:25.290> pages<00:02:25.530> so<00:02:25.829> obviously<00:02:26.250> number<00:02:26.670> one

00:02:26.869 --> 00:02:26.879 
mark the pages so obviously number one

00:02:26.879 --> 00:02:31.240 
mark the pages so obviously number one
that<00:02:27.540> is<00:02:27.659> my<00:02:27.840> first<00:02:28.079> fold<00:02:29.150> turn<00:02:30.150> it<00:02:30.299> over

00:02:31.240 --> 00:02:31.250 
that is my first fold turn it over

00:02:31.250 --> 00:02:53.210 
that is my first fold turn it over
that's<00:02:32.250> fold<00:02:32.670> to<00:02:36.349> fold<00:02:37.459> three<00:02:41.689> fold<00:02:49.430> five<00:02:52.220> and

00:02:53.210 --> 00:02:53.220 
that's fold to fold three fold five and

00:02:53.220 --> 00:02:56.449 
that's fold to fold three fold five and
fall<00:02:53.489> six<00:02:53.879> I'll<00:02:54.120> just<00:02:54.329> do<00:02:54.569> six<00:02:54.959> for<00:02:55.200> now<00:02:55.459> so

00:02:56.449 --> 00:02:56.459 
fall six I'll just do six for now so

00:02:56.459 --> 00:02:58.640 
fall six I'll just do six for now so
there<00:02:56.639> we're<00:02:56.760> going<00:02:56.970> back<00:02:57.150> to<00:02:57.359> number<00:02:57.629> one<00:02:57.659> so

00:02:58.640 --> 00:02:58.650 
there we're going back to number one so

00:02:58.650 --> 00:03:02.990 
there we're going back to number one so
I've<00:02:58.709> got<00:02:58.919> a<00:02:59.069> ruler<00:02:59.519> on<00:03:00.500> to<00:03:01.500> the<00:03:01.620> edge<00:03:02.000> make
