00:00:09.699 --> 00:00:13.889
 today it was so powerful since the expo santa rita we are offering all the 

00:00:13.889 --> 00:00:17.399
 highlight that it deserves this exhibition that grows year after year 

00:00:17.970 --> 00:00:22.109
 but before continuing with our journey from here with Caesar 

00:00:22.109 --> 00:00:25.289
 Villagra being the main novelties 

00:00:25.289 --> 00:00:30.539
 again we resume our series of the country's dairy breeds this time 

00:00:30.539 --> 00:00:35.680
 let's show the experience of a cabin that opted for the jersey race 

00:00:35.680 --> 00:00:38.680
 for the production of this field 

00:00:42.160 --> 00:00:46.400
 gil what he saw livestock breeds pri and paraguay is presented by 

00:00:48.300 --> 00:00:50.460
 In the south 

00:00:50.460 --> 00:00:53.540
 hilario for balanced h club 

00:01:04.150 --> 00:01:08.460
 the Jersey race presented the ability to adapt to different conditions 

00:01:08.460 --> 00:01:11.149
 climatological and geographical 

00:01:11.149 --> 00:01:16.069
 and is very efficient at producing more kilograms of milk per kilogram 

00:01:16.069 --> 00:01:19.360
 of body weight than any other race 

00:01:19.360 --> 00:01:23.460
 these conditions have influenced the lord of billy king dairy producer 

00:01:23.460 --> 00:01:28.710
 of our country to opt for this breed and face a production job with the 

00:01:28.710 --> 00:01:34.040
 field system that according to the owner is giving good results despite 

00:01:34.040 --> 00:01:37.380
 that the establishment is still in formation 

00:01:37.380 --> 00:01:40.659
 i for a matter of days cost of production 

00:01:41.730 --> 00:01:45.940
 p - problem with animals very uneven sheen output 

00:01:47.190 --> 00:01:51.760
 today in the establishment we are having 150 percent animals 

00:01:52.570 --> 00:01:54.630
 that are like to produce 

00:01:54.630 --> 00:01:57.290
 which of which 40% 

00:01:57.290 --> 00:01:58.800
 he has six 

00:01:58.800 --> 00:02:01.160
 in pure pedigree 

00:02:01.160 --> 00:02:05.650
 the coporo I feel are approximately in mestizo animals 

00:02:07.040 --> 00:02:10.469
 i the rest are pure orlando 

00:02:10.469 --> 00:02:13.589
 what elmo acquired for 

00:02:13.589 --> 00:02:16.919
 for car before the base poses to start from illa 

00:02:16.919 --> 00:02:21.539
 when reproducing yesi percent since our country does not then it does not get 

00:02:21.539 --> 00:02:21.909
 a 

00:02:21.909 --> 00:02:23.759
 great deal of 

00:02:23.759 --> 00:02:27.069
 is passing me the system that they are using in the establishment 

00:02:27.819 --> 00:02:31.659
 is field production without the use of grains with 

00:02:31.659 --> 00:02:35.469
 complementation of balanced according to the production of the animals 

00:02:36.139 --> 00:02:39.339
 at this time what I still holding with grass 

00:02:39.339 --> 00:02:42.339
 the pact paper that we are having minutes of dorissa santa 

00:02:42.979 --> 00:02:47.240
 that previously used it for the part of the shipping company now I will be 

00:02:47.240 --> 00:02:49.849
 just changing all this shepherdess 

00:02:49.849 --> 00:02:52.979
 in all the surface light breeze andalusian evening 

00:02:52.979 --> 00:02:57.549
 changing so a grass who has more protein that serves more 

00:02:57.549 --> 00:03:00.649
 for dairy animals comaltitlán 85 

00:03:00.649 --> 00:03:02.759
 if we are preparing already 

00:03:02.759 --> 00:03:06.009
 p apart from that we are having as an area 

00:03:07.229 --> 00:03:08.799
 agricultural 

00:03:08.799 --> 00:03:11.999
 b that is dedicated to the production of sugarcane then also 

00:03:11.999 --> 00:03:15.829
 we think and is amortizing caca uca cpi camerún 

00:03:15.829 --> 00:03:17.449
 for feeding 

00:03:17.449 --> 00:03:20.279
 pellerano politically 

00:03:20.279 --> 00:03:24.549
 is to that in the in the first round won no no percent and will include between the 

00:03:24.549 --> 00:03:26.579
 feeding the grain part 

00:03:26.579 --> 00:03:30.369
 according to very important variables in both the short and 

00:03:30.369 --> 00:03:34.639
 making a cost-benefit relationship according to the owner with this system 

00:03:34.639 --> 00:03:37.229
 they are getting good results 

00:03:37.229 --> 00:03:42.369
 Banton production as the rodeo reproduction parameters encouraged him and 

00:03:42.369 --> 00:03:45.369
 We are already having yen production and they are not responding very well 

00:03:46.079 --> 00:03:48.940
 if we make a comparison like that quickly 

00:03:48.940 --> 00:03:52.069
 of the productive part of milk 

00:03:52.069 --> 00:03:54.029
 we are talking about 

00:03:54.029 --> 00:03:55.949
 that an animal 

00:03:55.949 --> 00:04:02.189
 of 250 300 kilos as they are these can be produced temple 7 14 fifteen 

00:04:02.189 --> 00:04:05.209
 liters was just grass and a little balanced 

00:04:05.759 --> 00:04:10.649
 The goal set by the san Vicente cabin is to arrive in the future to attend 

00:04:10.649 --> 00:04:13.799
 100% of the duck with the race yersey 

00:04:13.799 --> 00:04:18.019
 that according to the owner provides many advantages such as a cost of production 

00:04:18.019 --> 00:04:20.430
 smaller to produce milk 

00:04:20.430 --> 00:04:24.969
 in the reproductive part you can quietly get a third per year 

00:04:24.969 --> 00:04:29.649
 they present fewer problems than the helmet first it was a childbirth auction and it has 

00:04:29.649 --> 00:04:32.649
 better adaptation to what is the climate of our country 

00:04:33.449 --> 00:04:37.840
 in terms of genetic improvement they are importing genetics from abroad 

00:04:37.840 --> 00:04:42.990
 and they are planning to develop a work of improvement with the skin 3 of 

00:04:42.990 --> 00:04:48.050
 better reproductive conditions we give falling 3 mbd what is 

00:04:48.050 --> 00:04:49.930
 united pink 

00:04:49.930 --> 00:04:52.939
 the president we are announcing this measure 

00:04:52.939 --> 00:04:56.460
 of that we do not believe that more than they are advancing the part d 

00:04:57.340 --> 00:04:58.620
 d 

00:04:58.620 --> 00:05:01.139
 the study scores 

00:05:01.139 --> 00:05:05.460
 i tried to use sexed semen solán to treat these the treasury 

00:05:05.460 --> 00:05:06.669
 the process 

00:05:06.669 --> 00:05:10.740
 to reach peace to what our goal in having approximately between 

00:05:11.319 --> 00:05:12.969
 500 animals 

00:05:12.969 --> 00:05:14.599
 percent of the race and yes 

00:05:14.599 --> 00:05:16.319
 we also want 

00:05:16.319 --> 00:05:17.839
 percent 

00:05:17.839 --> 00:05:21.860
 review our activities that were going to start giving birth 

00:05:22.509 --> 00:05:24.469
 in September or October 

00:05:24.469 --> 00:05:27.680
 and from there we go to the cup to control 

00:05:27.680 --> 00:05:31.990
 What is the best mother which is the best producer? 

00:05:31.990 --> 00:05:34.580
 after washing this brand after him 

00:05:34.580 --> 00:05:36.240
 million transfers 

00:05:36.240 --> 00:05:40.009
 let's try to use all existing technology buy accelerate 

00:05:40.009 --> 00:05:41.839
 our process of 

00:05:41.839 --> 00:05:44.550
 of growth in that square 

00:05:44.550 --> 00:05:47.629
 despite the good characteristics of the jersey race 

00:05:48.210 --> 00:05:51.759
 there are some details that you have to work more in this race according to 

00:05:51.759 --> 00:05:54.729
 expressed the owner of the establishment 

00:05:54.729 --> 00:05:56.779
 in our opinion 

00:05:56.779 --> 00:05:59.189
 we have to be 

00:05:59.189 --> 00:06:01.990
 enlarging a bit badly before 

00:06:01.990 --> 00:06:05.080
 We are together looking for elche and elche 

00:06:05.080 --> 00:06:07.969
 400 and 500 kilos 

00:06:07.969 --> 00:06:09.770
 s for us 

00:06:09.770 --> 00:06:13.520
 for him to protect our calculation that day the animal and to which we are 

00:06:13.520 --> 00:06:15.439
 searching 

00:06:15.439 --> 00:06:17.439
 because we also want to see what 

00:06:17.439 --> 00:06:19.610
 the bigger the same 

00:06:19.610 --> 00:06:22.009
 pastor producing more 

00:06:22.009 --> 00:06:23.909
 but we do not want to give it 

00:06:23.909 --> 00:06:28.009
 percent the weight that a plan has nor the stature of rudder 

00:06:28.009 --> 00:06:29.599
 we do not want to use 

00:06:29.599 --> 00:06:33.559
 the strength of the school and assign Celayense rusticity 

00:06:34.360 --> 00:06:35.180
 what 

00:06:35.180 --> 00:06:37.460
 pichilemu use 

00:06:37.460 --> 00:06:40.379
 Your good milk quality 

00:06:40.379 --> 00:06:42.169
 currently in the cabin 

00:06:42.169 --> 00:06:46.419
 they are using a still incipient system but the investment that they are 

00:06:46.419 --> 00:06:50.509
 developing aims to have a modern tambo with all the infrastructures 

00:06:50.509 --> 00:06:53.270
 for a good production job 

00:06:53.270 --> 00:06:57.169
 and delay all the conditions for the animal to exploit its potential 

00:06:57.169 --> 00:06:58.379
 productive 

00:06:58.379 --> 00:07:01.330
 this afternoon 

00:07:01.330 --> 00:07:04.599
 is to provide the greatest comfort or animals 

00:07:04.599 --> 00:07:09.139
 That's why we made a great effort to invest in this percent in these 

00:07:09.139 --> 00:07:10.849
 sheds 

00:07:10.849 --> 00:07:13.319
 not have half shade 

00:07:13.319 --> 00:07:15.889
 of sprinkler fans 

00:07:15.889 --> 00:07:17.099
 all that for 

00:07:17.099 --> 00:07:18.840
 like today he's going to try to give you a 

00:07:18.840 --> 00:07:21.649
 comfort to the animals in the summer 

00:07:21.649 --> 00:07:24.699
 because just the summer in Achilles tendon 

00:07:24.699 --> 00:07:27.610
 the animal suffers much more 

00:07:27.610 --> 00:07:30.840
 they are animals that are not so accustomed 

00:07:31.460 --> 00:07:32.930
 left post 

00:07:32.930 --> 00:07:37.919
 take her six of an animal that she is feeling in 3 5 to 7 degrees minus the 

00:07:37.919 --> 00:07:39.809
 heat that they speak it 

00:07:39.809 --> 00:07:44.159
 kesha eguna the advantage also extend to his health problem of the 

00:07:44.159 --> 00:07:46.319
 caloric stress 

00:07:46.319 --> 00:07:49.349
 the estuary of every form we are trying to 

00:07:49.349 --> 00:07:52.349
 make it more comfortable 

00:07:53.830 --> 00:07:57.910
 in what he saw to breeds cattle was a brief presentation 

00:07:58.589 --> 00:08:00.749
 In the south 

00:08:00.749 --> 00:08:03.839
 hilario for balanced hp light
