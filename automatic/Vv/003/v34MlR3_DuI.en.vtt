when he ended this series but I guess he

00:02:00.509 --> 00:02:02.899 
when he ended this series but I guess he
ended<00:02:00.930> it<00:02:01.049> because<00:02:01.200> she<00:02:01.860> wasn't<00:02:02.040> getting<00:02:02.729> the

this poster up and underneath the post
underneath<00:02:39.629> the<00:02:39.780> character<00:02:40.200> design<00:02:40.560> it<00:02:41.069> says

00:02:41.629 --> 00:02:41.639 
underneath the character design it says

00:02:41.639 --> 00:02:45.470 
underneath the character design it says
vongola<00:02:42.150> 15<00:02:42.810> so<00:02:43.560> i<00:02:43.980> guess<00:02:44.549> in<00:02:44.730> this<00:02:44.879> one<00:02:45.180> shot

00:02:45.470 --> 00:02:45.480 
vongola 15 so i guess in this one shot

00:02:45.480 --> 00:02:48.589 
vongola 15 so i guess in this one shot
it's<00:02:46.230> going<00:02:46.530> to<00:02:46.560> be<00:02:46.680> about<00:02:46.799> vongola<00:02:47.639> 15th<00:02:48.150> so

00:02:48.589 --> 00:02:48.599 
it's going to be about vongola 15th so

00:02:48.599 --> 00:02:51.140 
it's going to be about vongola 15th so
that's<00:02:49.379> someone<00:02:49.769> into<00:02:50.040> a<00:02:50.069> distant<00:02:50.549> i<00:02:50.639> guess

00:02:51.140 --> 00:02:51.150 
that's someone into a distant i guess

00:02:51.150 --> 00:02:53.869 
that's someone into a distant i guess
near<00:02:51.450> future<00:02:51.750> but<00:02:52.169> not<00:02:52.439> so<00:02:53.310> near<00:02:53.549> future

00:02:53.869 --> 00:02:53.879 
near future but not so near future

00:02:53.879 --> 00:02:58.220 
near future but not so near future
because<00:02:54.269> if<00:02:54.780> suna<00:02:55.470> is<00:02:56.209> vongole<00:02:57.209> attend<00:02:57.629> then

00:02:58.220 --> 00:02:58.230 
because if suna is vongole attend then

00:02:58.230 --> 00:02:59.809 
because if suna is vongole attend then
we're<00:02:58.409> going<00:02:58.530> five<00:02:58.859> generations<00:02:59.310> into<00:02:59.669> the

00:02:59.809 --> 00:02:59.819 
we're going five generations into the

00:02:59.819 --> 00:03:02.690 
we're going five generations into the
future<00:03:00.090> basically<00:03:00.659> you<00:03:00.840> know<00:03:00.930> absense<00:03:01.260> so<00:03:01.700> i'm

00:03:02.690 --> 00:03:02.700 
future basically you know absense so i'm

00:03:02.700 --> 00:03:05.270 
future basically you know absense so i'm
curious<00:03:03.120> what<00:03:03.269> she's<00:03:03.450> going<00:03:03.569> to<00:03:03.629> do<00:03:03.840> now<00:03:04.470> maybe

00:03:05.270 --> 00:03:05.280 
curious what she's going to do now maybe

00:03:05.280 --> 00:03:08.629 
curious what she's going to do now maybe
