00:00:01.579 --> 00:00:04.430
 Hello 

00:00:04.430 --> 00:00:08.969
 In recent years the eating habits of young people have been disturbed 

00:00:08.969 --> 00:00:13.790
 Undergraduate students who get frustrated by calcium deficiency 

00:00:13.789 --> 00:00:15.619
 It is said that there are many 

00:00:15.619 --> 00:00:19.009
 Please look at this graph 

00:00:19.009 --> 00:00:22.009
 When we took a questionnaire to eight university students across the country 

00:00:22.529 --> 00:00:24.999
 If I get frustrated for no reason 

00:00:24.999 --> 00:00:26.130
 answered 

00:00:26.130 --> 00:00:27.399
 College students 

00:00:27.399 --> 00:00:33.739
 75% of those medical colleges and university students who care about Kuribayashi today 

00:00:33.739 --> 00:00:35.060
 Thank you for coming 

00:00:35.060 --> 00:00:37.640
 I will be a classical teacher 

00:00:37.640 --> 00:00:42.320
 Refund amount is this performance and usability in the hall in the case of Goodman 

00:00:42.320 --> 00:00:45.120
 It's a good situation 

00:00:45.120 --> 00:00:46.690
 Today's establishment 

00:00:46.690 --> 00:00:51.930
 So from now on light and immediately measure his frustration level 

00:00:51.930 --> 00:00:53.400
 I will like to try 

00:00:53.400 --> 00:00:54.970
 What will measure 

00:00:54.970 --> 00:00:59.030
 Since Kasukabe's active measuring volcano, guard measuring active volcano 

00:00:59.570 --> 00:01:01.970
 This measure is 

00:01:01.970 --> 00:01:05.400
 This is an annoyed measuring instrument 

00:01:05.400 --> 00:01:07.150
 This part is 

00:01:07.150 --> 00:01:09.790
 Catch his beloved 

00:01:09.790 --> 00:01:10.930
 that is 

00:01:10.930 --> 00:01:15.700
 This point is why you start with a point as a focus obi or vibration 

00:01:16.240 --> 00:01:18.020
 I'm in this seat 

00:01:18.020 --> 00:01:21.270
 It is a place like the benefit of civilization 

00:01:21.270 --> 00:01:24.720
 Then I will ask him some questions from now on 

00:01:24.720 --> 00:01:26.070
 Faint 

00:01:26.070 --> 00:01:28.940
 Indicates the airing of the measurement 

00:01:28.940 --> 00:01:32.910
 Is it easy for the country to come pip from 1982? 

00:01:34.500 --> 00:01:39.180
 It seems to have reported on the active volcano and will be soon 

00:01:39.180 --> 00:01:41.970
 Yes, it's definitely amazing 

00:01:41.970 --> 00:01:43.420
 So here 

00:01:43.420 --> 00:01:46.110
 Contains plenty of calcium 

00:01:46.110 --> 00:01:49.620
 I would like to give him Japanese specifications 

00:01:56.190 --> 00:01:59.180
 How about a virtual server gun 

00:01:59.180 --> 00:02:02.180
 Hirano has been very stable 

00:02:03.000 --> 00:02:04.080
 Country turns around 

00:02:04.080 --> 00:02:05.820
 How is the deadline 

00:02:05.820 --> 00:02:07.750
 Sent to Miyadaira 

00:02:07.750 --> 00:02:09.429

00:02:09.429 --> 00:02:12.849
 As there is another girl 

00:02:12.849 --> 00:02:15.449
 Japan itself is really amazing 

00:02:15.449 --> 00:02:19.199
 Gimhae so 680 yen policy 

00:02:19.199 --> 00:02:22.489
 We offer knock for 680 yen 

00:02:24.389 --> 00:02:28.790
 At the time of the show, the proposal is connected, so 

00:02:28.789 --> 00:02:29.599
 Please be careful 

00:02:29.599 --> 00:02:32.319
 Last month in court 

00:02:32.319 --> 00:02:35.399
