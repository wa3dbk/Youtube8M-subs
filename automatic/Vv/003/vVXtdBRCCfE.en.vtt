00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.639
 You left the Rotterdam traffic police office when we left 

00:00:03.639 --> 00:00:06.609
 The mobile phone heard that there was an armed robbery at a postal agency 

00:00:06.609 --> 00:00:08.139
 had been 

00:00:08.139 --> 00:00:11.299
 coincidentally there was a van from the parking police behind the escape car with 

00:00:11.299 --> 00:00:12.209
 the perpetrators 

00:00:12.209 --> 00:00:15.339
 but of course the parking police couldn't do much more than escape 

00:00:15.339 --> 00:00:17.539
 continue to follow at a distance 

00:00:17.539 --> 00:00:20.720
 first see how the robbers pass by at the end of this street 

00:00:21.460 --> 00:00:23.480
 and just after that the van 

00:00:23.480 --> 00:00:27.060
 we enjoyed according to market just on the right comes the white van 

00:00:27.060 --> 00:00:30.060
 parking police 

00:00:32.940 --> 00:00:35.940
 then a police car 

00:00:37.200 --> 00:00:38.900
 there it is 

00:00:38.900 --> 00:00:42.070
 and therefore naturally at the back 

00:00:42.070 --> 00:00:43.490
 and not only with 

00:00:43.490 --> 00:00:46.490
 the courts of rotterdam police have since been mobilized 

00:00:49.710 --> 00:00:52.710
 trying to walk in 

00:00:55.890 --> 00:00:58.890
 the van of the parking police neatly makes place right on Wednesday 

00:00:59.780 --> 00:01:01.970
 and we take over the chase 

00:01:01.970 --> 00:01:05.350
 but because of the busy traffic the red fruit disappears through the image 

00:01:05.350 --> 00:01:08.350
 the company can also be lost 

00:01:09.070 --> 00:01:11.500
 then we also want to be a nut village again 

00:01:11.500 --> 00:01:14.790
 the voltage rises in the camera car 

00:01:14.790 --> 00:01:17.790
 the land glider 

00:01:22.910 --> 00:01:25.910
 and therefore cause some panic in a training car 

00:01:26.700 --> 00:01:29.700
 who stood still at an intersection he tried to come by 

00:01:32.400 --> 00:01:35.830
 we let the colleagues in the striking police car inside 

00:01:35.830 --> 00:01:38.830
 the man then fled the country 

00:01:42.920 --> 00:01:46.049
 they cannot go in many directions and traps are placed on all sides 

00:01:46.590 --> 00:01:49.080
 hopefully they get stuck 

00:01:49.080 --> 00:01:52.080
 At the end of this road, turn right into the Boston 

00:01:56.610 --> 00:01:58.090
 nobody sees Ceulaer 

00:01:58.090 --> 00:02:01.090
 they would have escaped 

00:02:03.470 --> 00:02:06.470
 but we don't give up, we keep going 

00:02:09.979 --> 00:02:12.979
 we hope that all traps will close in time 

00:02:18.019 --> 00:02:21.370
 and that everything in traffic continues to go well because it's no easy task 

00:02:21.370 --> 00:02:24.369
 to ride such an animal in other words 

00:02:24.369 --> 00:02:27.959
 a bend to the right a bend to the left and then they have to stand straight 

00:02:29.759 --> 00:02:32.759
 if all is well 

00:02:35.309 --> 00:02:38.409
 and indeed there the valles are closed 

00:02:42.739 --> 00:02:46.639
 our cameraman must stay in the car for a while until it is certain that it is not 

00:02:46.639 --> 00:02:50.650
 but when the car is out everything suddenly goes super fast 

00:02:50.650 --> 00:02:53.650
 robbers are enthralled 

00:02:58.679 --> 00:03:01.679
 and again investigated for weapons 

00:03:12.349 --> 00:03:15.819
 they seem a bit overwhelmed by the faster city park 

00:03:18.329 --> 00:03:21.409
 the first offender is literally arrested and taken away 

00:03:23.149 --> 00:03:26.149
 get there 

00:03:29.879 --> 00:03:31.379
 he gets 

00:03:31.379 --> 00:03:34.639
 just put it over 

00:03:34.639 --> 00:03:35.899
 8 

00:03:35.899 --> 00:03:38.899
 Fighting Sunday must also end the second half 

00:03:41.429 --> 00:03:43.529
 and that is that again 

00:03:43.529 --> 00:03:46.529
 it seems like a routine job 

00:03:50.359 --> 00:03:53.339
 the postal agency is closed the rest of the day 

00:03:53.339 --> 00:03:54.009
 understandable
