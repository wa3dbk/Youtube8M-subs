00:00:53.869 --> 00:00:53.879 
friend the Barbarian well I'd say

00:00:53.879 --> 00:00:55.819 
friend the Barbarian well I'd say
there's<00:00:54.120> a<00:00:54.180> few<00:00:54.480> reasons<00:00:54.690> actually<00:00:55.350> first<00:00:55.620> is

00:00:55.819 --> 00:00:55.829 
there's a few reasons actually first is

00:00:55.829 --> 00:00:57.979 
there's a few reasons actually first is
the<00:00:55.920> fact<00:00:56.070> that<00:00:56.219> she's<00:00:56.460> faster<00:00:57.030> also<00:00:57.510> she<00:00:57.840> can

00:00:57.979 --> 00:00:57.989 
the fact that she's faster also she can

00:00:57.989 --> 00:01:00.529 
the fact that she's faster also she can
fire<00:00:58.350> on<00:00:58.590> ground<00:00:58.859> and<00:00:59.219> air<00:00:59.520> targets<00:00:59.850> but

00:01:00.529 --> 00:01:00.539 
fire on ground and air targets but

00:01:00.539 --> 00:01:02.090 
fire on ground and air targets but
probably<00:01:01.079> most<00:01:01.289> importantly<00:01:01.829> is<00:01:01.980> the<00:01:02.070> fact

00:01:02.090 --> 00:01:02.100 
probably most importantly is the fact

00:01:02.100 --> 00:01:03.860 
probably most importantly is the fact
that<00:01:02.399> the<00:01:02.550> archer<00:01:02.969> likes<00:01:03.180> to<00:01:03.390> deal<00:01:03.570> damage

00:01:03.860 --> 00:01:03.870 
that the archer likes to deal damage

00:01:03.870 --> 00:01:06.560 
that the archer likes to deal damage
from<00:01:04.229> a<00:01:04.350> distance<00:01:04.580> while<00:01:05.580> the<00:01:05.790> Barbarian<00:01:06.360> goes
