little<00:01:19.650> bell<00:01:19.799> curry<00:01:20.040> get<00:01:20.340> the<00:01:20.460> point<00:01:20.700> to<00:01:20.850> make

00:01:20.929 --> 00:01:20.939 
little bell curry get the point to make

00:01:20.939 --> 00:01:24.050 
little bell curry get the point to make
it<00:01:21.090> tied<00:01:21.299> I<00:01:22.369> think<00:01:23.369> valkyrie<00:01:23.670> might<00:01:23.820> get<00:01:23.970> the

00:01:24.050 --> 00:01:24.060 
it tied I think valkyrie might get the

it tied I think valkyrie might get the
point<00:01:24.270> to<00:01:24.360> make<00:01:24.509> a<00:01:24.540> time

00:01:28.890 --> 00:01:28.900 

00:01:28.900 --> 00:01:33.700

was deaths i sir since i saw it's been a
little<00:01:36.560> bit<00:01:36.650> at<00:01:36.890> the<00:01:36.920> end<00:01:37.070> but<00:01:37.909> i'll<00:01:38.390> probably

00:01:38.710 --> 00:01:38.720 
little bit at the end but i'll probably

00:01:38.720 --> 00:01:40.330 
little bit at the end but i'll probably
just<00:01:38.869> replay<00:01:39.350> it<00:01:39.409> and<00:01:39.649> you'll<00:01:39.740> just<00:01:39.920> see<00:01:40.040> who

00:01:40.330 --> 00:01:40.340 
just replay it and you'll just see who

00:01:40.340 --> 00:01:41.530 
just replay it and you'll just see who
was<00:01:40.460> the<00:01:40.549> score<00:01:40.790> pretty<00:01:41.060> sure<00:01:41.149> with<00:01:41.299> death

00:01:41.530 --> 00:01:41.540 
was the score pretty sure with death

00:01:41.540 --> 00:01:49.899 
was the score pretty sure with death
sizer<00:01:47.649> if<00:01:48.649> not<00:01:48.799> i'll<00:01:49.039> just<00:01:49.070> go<00:01:49.399> with<00:01:49.580> the<00:01:49.610> score

00:01:49.899 --> 00:01:49.909 
sizer if not i'll just go with the score

00:01:49.909 --> 00:01:52.690 
sizer if not i'll just go with the score
for<00:01:50.090> both<00:01:50.530> so<00:01:51.530> it's<00:01:51.710> either<00:01:51.799> two<00:01:52.250> points<00:01:52.580> to

00:01:52.690 --> 00:01:52.700 
for both so it's either two points to

00:01:52.700 --> 00:01:58.090 
for both so it's either two points to
nothing<00:01:53.090> or<00:01:53.299> one<00:01:53.690> on<00:01:53.840> one<00:01:54.049> Oh<00:01:56.530> whoopsie<00:01:57.530> yeah<00:01:57.649> 1

00:01:58.090 --> 00:01:58.100 
nothing or one on one Oh whoopsie yeah 1

00:01:58.100 --> 00:02:00.430 
nothing or one on one Oh whoopsie yeah 1
i'll<00:01:58.700> launch<00:01:58.909> this<00:01:59.390> one<00:01:59.569> first<00:01:59.780> nap<00:01:59.990> for<00:02:00.259> round

00:02:00.430 --> 00:02:00.440 
i'll launch this one first nap for round

00:02:00.440 --> 00:02:08.850 
i'll launch this one first nap for round
three<00:02:04.750> so<00:02:05.750> let's<00:02:05.929> he'll<00:02:06.080> run<00:02:06.409> with<00:02:06.619> round<00:02:06.860> 3

00:02:08.850 --> 00:02:08.860 
three so let's he'll run with round 3

00:02:08.860 --> 00:02:11.590 
three so let's he'll run with round 3
i'll<00:02:09.860> just<00:02:10.310> do<00:02:10.459> a<00:02:10.489> few<00:02:10.729> rounds<00:02:10.910> i<00:02:11.180> believe<00:02:11.450> it

00:02:11.590 --> 00:02:11.600 
i'll just do a few rounds i believe it

00:02:11.600 --> 00:02:16.509 
i'll just do a few rounds i believe it
was<00:02:11.660> definitely<00:02:12.130> yeah<00:02:13.130> okay<00:02:13.489> well<00:02:15.160> we<00:02:16.160> would

00:02:16.509 --> 00:02:16.519 
was definitely yeah okay well we would

00:02:16.519 --> 00:02:18.940 
was definitely yeah okay well we would
eat<00:02:16.790> i'm<00:02:17.209> guessing<00:02:17.540> the<00:02:17.750> score<00:02:18.380> is<00:02:18.590> three<00:02:18.920> to

00:02:18.940 --> 00:02:18.950 
eat i'm guessing the score is three to

00:02:18.950 --> 00:02:24.640 
eat i'm guessing the score is three to
nothing<00:02:20.260> what's<00:02:21.260> his<00:02:21.560> death<00:02:21.860> sizer<00:02:22.220> one<00:02:23.650> since

00:02:24.640 --> 00:02:24.650 
nothing what's his death sizer one since

00:02:24.650 --> 00:02:27.250 
nothing what's his death sizer one since
it's<00:02:24.830> like<00:02:25.100> three<00:02:25.340> to<00:02:25.459> nothing<00:02:25.580> by<00:02:25.910> now<00:02:26.260> but

00:02:27.250 --> 00:02:27.260 
it's like three to nothing by now but

00:02:27.260 --> 00:02:28.930 
it's like three to nothing by now but
we'll<00:02:27.920> just<00:02:27.950> do<00:02:28.190> one<00:02:28.340> more<00:02:28.489> round<00:02:28.640> for<00:02:28.880> the

00:02:28.930 --> 00:02:28.940 
we'll just do one more round for the

00:02:28.940 --> 00:02:38.410 
we'll just do one more round for the
