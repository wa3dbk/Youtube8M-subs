00:03:40.790 --> 00:03:42.819 
bit by bit we came together and then we
basically<00:03:41.120> fuse<00:03:41.599> the<00:03:42.049> storyline<00:03:42.500> in<00:03:42.650> gameplay

00:03:42.819 --> 00:03:42.829 
basically fuse the storyline in gameplay

00:03:42.829 --> 00:03:46.089 
basically fuse the storyline in gameplay
into<00:03:43.489> one<00:03:43.900> and<00:03:44.900> so<00:03:45.319> Wesley<00:03:45.560> when<00:03:45.799> the<00:03:45.889> player

00:03:46.089 --> 00:03:46.099 
into one and so Wesley when the player

00:03:46.099 --> 00:03:50.110 
into one and so Wesley when the player
plays<00:03:46.400> the<00:03:46.639> game<00:03:46.849> he<00:03:48.430> every<00:03:49.430> action<00:03:49.639> that<00:03:49.849> he

00:03:50.110 --> 00:03:50.120 
plays the game he every action that he

00:03:50.120 --> 00:03:52.030 
plays the game he every action that he
does<00:03:50.359> is<00:03:50.690> the<00:03:50.989> unveiling<00:03:51.380> of<00:03:51.560> the<00:03:51.680> storyline

00:03:52.030 --> 00:03:52.040 
does is the unveiling of the storyline

00:03:52.040 --> 00:03:53.949 
does is the unveiling of the storyline
so<00:03:52.730> there<00:03:52.880> is<00:03:53.000> none<00:03:53.180> of<00:03:53.299> this<00:03:53.419> cutscene

00:03:53.949 --> 00:03:53.959 
so there is none of this cutscene

00:03:53.959 --> 00:03:56.229 
so there is none of this cutscene
narrative<00:03:54.620> it<00:03:54.859> is<00:03:55.010> all<00:03:55.190> everything<00:03:55.970> to<00:03:56.150> do

00:03:56.229 --> 00:03:56.239 
narrative it is all everything to do

00:03:56.239 --> 00:03:57.690 
narrative it is all everything to do
with<00:03:56.359> story<00:03:56.660> happens<00:03:57.139> while<00:03:57.380> you're<00:03:57.410> playing

00:03:57.690 --> 00:03:57.700 
with story happens while you're playing

00:03:57.700 --> 00:04:00.729 
with story happens while you're playing
so<00:03:58.700> you<00:03:59.630> know<00:03:59.690> an<00:03:59.840> answer<00:03:59.959> to<00:04:00.230> your<00:04:00.319> question

00:04:00.729 --> 00:04:00.739 
so you know an answer to your question

00:04:00.739 --> 00:04:03.220 
so you know an answer to your question
when<00:04:01.459> the<00:04:01.639> script<00:04:01.910> was<00:04:01.940> devised<00:04:02.329> and<00:04:02.720> we<00:04:02.840> put

00:04:03.220 --> 00:04:03.230 
when the script was devised and we put

00:04:03.230 --> 00:04:06.250 
when the script was devised and we put
it<00:04:03.260> into<00:04:03.440> ax<00:04:03.739> we<00:04:04.400> knew<00:04:04.730> where<00:04:05.030> things<00:04:05.810> like<00:04:05.959> the

00:04:06.250 --> 00:04:06.260 
it into ax we knew where things like the

00:04:06.260 --> 00:04:07.900 
it into ax we knew where things like the
super<00:04:06.650> boss<00:04:06.829> vehicles<00:04:07.250> would<00:04:07.370> be<00:04:07.549> we<00:04:07.700> knew

00:04:07.900 --> 00:04:07.910 
super boss vehicles would be we knew

00:04:07.910 --> 00:04:09.580 
super boss vehicles would be we knew
when<00:04:08.090> certain<00:04:08.389> things<00:04:08.540> would<00:04:08.900> happen<00:04:09.079> a<00:04:09.349> big

00:04:09.580 --> 00:04:09.590 
when certain things would happen a big

00:04:09.590 --> 00:04:12.069 
when certain things would happen a big
twist<00:04:09.919> in<00:04:10.069> the<00:04:10.190> story<00:04:10.220> line<00:04:10.639> and<00:04:10.849> once<00:04:11.720> we<00:04:11.900> knew

00:04:12.069 --> 00:04:12.079 
twist in the story line and once we knew

00:04:12.079 --> 00:04:13.449 
twist in the story line and once we knew
where<00:04:12.260> those<00:04:12.410> were<00:04:12.709> and<00:04:13.040> once<00:04:13.190> we<00:04:13.340> knew

00:04:13.449 --> 00:04:13.459 
where those were and once we knew

00:04:13.459 --> 00:04:15.879 
where those were and once we knew
exactly<00:04:13.760> the<00:04:14.150> direction<00:04:14.569> of<00:04:14.930> the<00:04:15.049> product<00:04:15.379> we

00:04:15.879 --> 00:04:15.889 
exactly the direction of the product we

00:04:15.889 --> 00:04:17.979 
exactly the direction of the product we
then<00:04:16.160> evolved<00:04:16.760> existing<00:04:17.269> mechanics<00:04:17.810> we

00:04:17.979 --> 00:04:17.989 
then evolved existing mechanics we

00:04:17.989 --> 00:04:20.289 
then evolved existing mechanics we
created<00:04:18.440> new<00:04:18.709> mechanics<00:04:19.250> and<00:04:19.459> now<00:04:19.970> we<00:04:20.030> have<00:04:20.269> a

00:04:20.289 --> 00:04:20.299 
created new mechanics and now we have a

00:04:20.299 --> 00:04:22.510 
created new mechanics and now we have a
huge<00:04:20.570> variety<00:04:20.919> throughout<00:04:21.919> the<00:04:22.099> game<00:04:22.130> when<00:04:22.490> we

00:04:22.510 --> 00:04:22.520 
huge variety throughout the game when we

00:04:22.520 --> 00:04:26.879 
huge variety throughout the game when we
also<00:04:22.789> have<00:04:23.500> one<00:04:24.500> off<00:04:24.849> mechanics<00:04:25.849> which<00:04:26.030> I<00:04:26.180> like

00:04:26.879 --> 00:04:26.889 
also have one off mechanics which I like

00:04:26.889 --> 00:04:30.310 
also have one off mechanics which I like
if<00:04:27.889> Anna<00:04:28.150> stiffen<00:04:29.150> the<00:04:29.240> storyline<00:04:29.719> a<00:04:29.750> specific

00:04:30.310 --> 00:04:30.320 
if Anna stiffen the storyline a specific

00:04:30.320 --> 00:04:30.730 
if Anna stiffen the storyline a specific
thing

00:04:30.730 --> 00:04:30.740 
thing

00:04:30.740 --> 00:04:33.010 
thing
to<00:04:30.889> happen<00:04:31.160> then<00:04:31.370> we<00:04:31.520> created<00:04:32.030> the<00:04:32.150> code<00:04:32.389> for

00:04:33.010 --> 00:04:33.020 
to happen then we created the code for

00:04:33.020 --> 00:04:34.330 
to happen then we created the code for
the<00:04:33.110> player<00:04:33.289> to<00:04:33.319> do<00:04:33.530> something<00:04:33.860> unique<00:04:34.160> in

00:04:34.330 --> 00:04:34.340 
the player to do something unique in

00:04:34.340 --> 00:04:36.460 
the player to do something unique in
each<00:04:34.490> mission<00:04:34.729> to<00:04:35.060> make<00:04:35.180> sure<00:04:35.360> that<00:04:35.660> works<00:04:35.870> so

00:04:36.460 --> 00:04:36.470 
each mission to make sure that works so

00:04:36.470 --> 00:04:39.040 
each mission to make sure that works so
we<00:04:36.560> have<00:04:36.710> generic<00:04:37.160> and<00:04:37.400> we<00:04:37.520> have<00:04:38.050> single

00:04:39.040 --> 00:04:39.050 
we have generic and we have single

00:04:39.050 --> 00:04:40.570 
we have generic and we have single
sections<00:04:39.470> so<00:04:39.740> there's<00:04:39.979> a<00:04:40.069> hell<00:04:40.220> of<00:04:40.250> a<00:04:40.370> lot<00:04:40.460> in

00:04:40.570 --> 00:04:40.580 
sections so there's a hell of a lot in

00:04:40.580 --> 00:04:43.150 
sections so there's a hell of a lot in
the<00:04:40.639> game<00:04:40.990> well<00:04:41.990> it<00:04:42.259> kind<00:04:42.770> of<00:04:42.830> all<00:04:42.949> fell<00:04:43.130> into

00:04:43.150 --> 00:04:43.160 
the game well it kind of all fell into

00:04:43.160 --> 00:04:46.029 
the game well it kind of all fell into
place<00:04:43.400> if<00:04:44.330> I<00:04:44.539> you<00:04:45.199> see<00:04:45.349> the<00:04:45.470> difficulty<00:04:45.740> is

00:04:46.029 --> 00:04:46.039 
place if I you see the difficulty is

00:04:46.039 --> 00:04:47.890 
place if I you see the difficulty is
that<00:04:46.069> if<00:04:46.340> I<00:04:46.460> explain<00:04:46.849> and<00:04:47.210> story<00:04:47.479> to<00:04:47.660> you<00:04:47.750> then

00:04:47.890 --> 00:04:47.900 
that if I explain and story to you then

00:04:47.900 --> 00:04:50.439 
that if I explain and story to you then
it<00:04:48.050> kind<00:04:48.289> of<00:04:48.410> it'll<00:04:49.130> ruin<00:04:49.310> it<00:04:49.520> somewhat<00:04:49.970> but

00:04:50.439 --> 00:04:50.449 
it kind of it'll ruin it somewhat but

00:04:50.449 --> 00:04:52.900 
it kind of it'll ruin it somewhat but
because<00:04:50.870> of<00:04:50.900> the<00:04:51.830> gang<00:04:52.039> is<00:04:52.069> basically<00:04:52.729> in<00:04:52.819> the

00:04:52.900 --> 00:04:52.910 
because of the gang is basically in the

00:04:52.910 --> 00:04:54.490 
because of the gang is basically in the
storyline<00:04:53.210> are<00:04:53.449> organized<00:04:53.840> and<00:04:54.169> they<00:04:54.289> have

00:04:54.490 --> 00:04:54.500 
storyline are organized and they have

00:04:54.500 --> 00:04:56.860 
storyline are organized and they have
the<00:04:54.650> single<00:04:54.979> goal<00:04:55.190> and<00:04:55.720> effectively<00:04:56.720> the

00:04:56.860 --> 00:04:56.870 
the single goal and effectively the

00:04:56.870 --> 00:04:59.860 
the single goal and effectively the
single<00:04:57.199> goal<00:04:57.349> is<00:04:57.560> to<00:04:57.910> flatten<00:04:58.910> the<00:04:59.660> whole<00:04:59.840> of

00:04:59.860 --> 00:04:59.870 
single goal is to flatten the whole of

00:04:59.870 --> 00:05:03.040 
single goal is to flatten the whole of
the<00:05:00.080> city<00:05:00.940> so<00:05:01.940> the<00:05:02.270> things<00:05:02.509> to<00:05:02.690> do<00:05:02.810> with<00:05:02.930> the

00:05:03.040 --> 00:05:03.050 
the city so the things to do with the

00:05:03.050 --> 00:05:05.800 
the city so the things to do with the
plane<00:05:03.319> things<00:05:03.889> to<00:05:04.069> do<00:05:04.190> with<00:05:04.310> the<00:05:04.460> train<00:05:04.810> the

00:05:05.800 --> 00:05:05.810 
plane things to do with the train the

00:05:05.810 --> 00:05:08.499 
plane things to do with the train the
tank<00:05:06.139> these<00:05:06.560> are<00:05:06.710> all<00:05:06.740> integral<00:05:07.580> to<00:05:08.180> what<00:05:08.210> you

00:05:08.499 --> 00:05:08.509 
tank these are all integral to what you

00:05:08.509 --> 00:05:10.390 
tank these are all integral to what you
would<00:05:08.630> find<00:05:08.690> in<00:05:09.319> a<00:05:09.440> Hollywood<00:05:09.620> action<00:05:09.979> may<00:05:10.280> be

00:05:10.390 --> 00:05:10.400 
would find in a Hollywood action may be

00:05:10.400 --> 00:05:12.279 
would find in a Hollywood action may be
in<00:05:10.580> order<00:05:10.729> for<00:05:11.030> the<00:05:11.090> gangs<00:05:11.330> to<00:05:11.599> execute<00:05:12.110> their

00:05:12.279 --> 00:05:12.289 
in order for the gangs to execute their

00:05:12.289 --> 00:05:14.920 
in order for the gangs to execute their
goal<00:05:12.500> so<00:05:13.099> it's<00:05:13.250> not<00:05:13.340> like<00:05:13.520> we<00:05:13.669> thought<00:05:13.880> hey<00:05:14.569> be

00:05:14.920 --> 00:05:14.930 
goal so it's not like we thought hey be

00:05:14.930 --> 00:05:17.170 
goal so it's not like we thought hey be
cool<00:05:15.139> to<00:05:15.289> have<00:05:15.409> a<00:05:15.440> plane<00:05:15.800> it<00:05:16.370> was<00:05:16.490> like<00:05:16.669> if

00:05:17.170 --> 00:05:17.180 
cool to have a plane it was like if

00:05:17.180 --> 00:05:18.850 
cool to have a plane it was like if
someone<00:05:17.659> was<00:05:17.810> going<00:05:17.960> to<00:05:18.050> say<00:05:18.349> drop<00:05:18.560> a<00:05:18.590> bomb

00:05:18.850 --> 00:05:18.860 
someone was going to say drop a bomb

00:05:18.860 --> 00:05:21.399 
someone was going to say drop a bomb
then<00:05:19.669> how<00:05:19.849> would<00:05:19.909> they<00:05:20.150> do<00:05:20.210> it<00:05:20.479> and<00:05:20.659> so<00:05:21.110> then<00:05:21.289> we

00:05:21.399 --> 00:05:21.409 
then how would they do it and so then we

00:05:21.409 --> 00:05:23.890 
then how would they do it and so then we
go<00:05:21.560> okay<00:05:22.069> cool<00:05:22.430> man<00:05:22.729> let's<00:05:23.240> have<00:05:23.449> a<00:05:23.479> massive

00:05:23.890 --> 00:05:23.900 
go okay cool man let's have a massive

00:05:23.900 --> 00:05:26.110
