00:02:31.770 --> 00:02:31.780 
seam oops my camera work here there's a

00:02:31.780 --> 00:02:33.270 
seam oops my camera work here there's a
seam<00:02:32.110> that<00:02:32.140> runs<00:02:32.350> along<00:02:32.740> here<00:02:32.770> that<00:02:33.010> it

00:02:33.270 --> 00:02:33.280 
seam that runs along here that it

00:02:33.280 --> 00:02:34.860 
seam that runs along here that it
noticed<00:02:33.580> before<00:02:33.700> which<00:02:34.150> they<00:02:34.390> actually

00:02:34.860 --> 00:02:34.870 
noticed before which they actually

00:02:34.870 --> 00:02:37.340 
noticed before which they actually
depending<00:02:35.770> on<00:02:35.890> how<00:02:36.040> the<00:02:36.100> light<00:02:36.520> catches<00:02:36.790> it

00:02:37.340 --> 00:02:37.350 
depending on how the light catches it

00:02:37.350 --> 00:02:41.940 
depending on how the light catches it
they<00:02:38.350> actually<00:02:39.040> just<00:02:39.970> have<00:02:40.240> it<00:02:40.680> turn<00:02:41.680> around

00:02:41.940 --> 00:02:41.950 
they actually just have it turn around

00:02:41.950 --> 00:02:45.720 
they actually just have it turn around
to<00:02:42.070> the<00:02:42.100> back<00:02:42.190> here<00:02:43.800> they<00:02:44.800> just<00:02:44.830> have<00:02:45.190> a<00:02:45.220> glue

00:02:45.720 --> 00:02:45.730 
to the back here they just have a glue

00:02:45.730 --> 00:02:49.890 
to the back here they just have a glue
line<00:02:46.000> right<00:02:46.570> along<00:02:46.870> there<00:02:48.480> which<00:02:49.480> I<00:02:49.630> found

00:02:49.890 --> 00:02:49.900 
line right along there which I found

00:02:49.900 --> 00:02:51.120 
line right along there which I found
interesting<00:02:50.080> I<00:02:50.410> never<00:02:50.590> did<00:02:50.800> notice<00:02:51.100> that

00:02:51.120 --> 00:02:51.130

interested it's still it's us basically

00:03:23.680 --> 00:03:26.190 
interested it's still it's us basically
it's<00:03:23.830> a<00:03:23.920> smaller<00:03:24.220> proportion<00:03:25.020> version<00:03:26.020> as

00:03:26.190 --> 00:03:26.200 
it's a smaller proportion version as

00:03:26.200 --> 00:03:28.410 
it's a smaller proportion version as
compared<00:03:26.560> to<00:03:26.620> the<00:03:26.770> large<00:03:26.950> one<00:03:27.010> but<00:03:27.370> it<00:03:28.090> is<00:03:28.209> very

00:03:28.410 --> 00:03:28.420 
compared to the large one but it is very

00:03:28.420 --> 00:03:29.880 
compared to the large one but it is very
in<00:03:28.570> proportion<00:03:29.110> I<00:03:29.230> know<00:03:29.290> there's<00:03:29.560> one<00:03:29.740> out

00:03:29.880 --> 00:03:29.890 
in proportion I know there's one out

00:03:29.890 --> 00:03:32.820 
in proportion I know there's one out
there<00:03:29.970> that's<00:03:30.970> from<00:03:31.330> the<00:03:31.600> DVD<00:03:32.140> set<00:03:32.470> that<00:03:32.650> was<00:03:32.800> a

00:03:32.820 --> 00:03:32.830 
there that's from the DVD set that was a

00:03:32.830 --> 00:03:35.040 
there that's from the DVD set that was a
release<00:03:33.130> that<00:03:33.310> is<00:03:33.490> not<00:03:34.450> really<00:03:34.780> sized

00:03:35.040 --> 00:03:35.050 
release that is not really sized

00:03:35.050 --> 00:03:39.810 
release that is not really sized
correctly<00:03:36.720> this<00:03:37.720> one's<00:03:37.990> still<00:03:38.230> very<00:03:38.470> nice<00:03:38.820> the

00:03:39.810 --> 00:03:39.820 
correctly this one's still very nice the

00:03:39.820 --> 00:03:42.570 
correctly this one's still very nice the
main<00:03:40.000> things<00:03:40.840> with<00:03:41.110> it<00:03:41.290> is<00:03:41.470> besides<00:03:42.340> the<00:03:42.400> fact

00:03:42.570 --> 00:03:42.580 
main things with it is besides the fact

00:03:42.580 --> 00:03:44.970 
main things with it is besides the fact
that<00:03:42.670> it's<00:03:42.820> smaller<00:03:43.060> is<00:03:43.300> these<00:03:43.780> it<00:03:44.170> is<00:03:44.739> just

00:03:44.970 --> 00:03:44.980 
that it's smaller is these it is just

00:03:44.980 --> 00:03:47.870 
that it's smaller is these it is just
one<00:03:45.250> sheet<00:03:45.489> it<00:03:45.670> does<00:03:45.820> not<00:03:45.970> flip<00:03:46.390> up<00:03:46.570> whatsoever

00:03:47.870 --> 00:03:47.880

00:04:01.630 --> 00:04:03.320 
like a weird way so this like this page
sure<00:04:01.840> you<00:04:01.989> can't<00:04:02.200> even<00:04:02.410> really<00:04:02.530> put<00:04:02.650> together

00:04:03.320 --> 00:04:03.330 
sure you can't even really put together

00:04:03.330 --> 00:04:05.790 
sure you can't even really put together
just<00:04:04.330> because<00:04:04.690> the<00:04:04.989> way<00:04:05.110> that<00:04:05.290> they<00:04:05.410> made<00:04:05.620> it

00:04:05.790 --> 00:04:05.800 
just because the way that they made it

00:04:05.800 --> 00:04:08.580 
just because the way that they made it
which<00:04:05.950> I<00:04:06.330> think<00:04:07.330> that's<00:04:08.050> what<00:04:08.230> made<00:04:08.350> me<00:04:08.440> want

00:04:08.580 --> 00:04:08.590 
which I think that's what made me want

00:04:08.590 --> 00:04:09.870 
which I think that's what made me want
to<00:04:08.650> go<00:04:08.739> back<00:04:08.920> and<00:04:09.040> get<00:04:09.130> the<00:04:09.250> big<00:04:09.400> one<00:04:09.580> again<00:04:09.760> at

00:04:09.870 --> 00:04:09.880 
to go back and get the big one again at

00:04:09.880 --> 00:04:11.010 
to go back and get the big one again at
first<00:04:10.060> I<00:04:10.150> was<00:04:10.270> going<00:04:10.360> to<00:04:10.450> settle<00:04:10.720> with<00:04:10.840> this

00:04:11.010 --> 00:04:11.020 
first I was going to settle with this

00:04:11.020 --> 00:04:13.290 
first I was going to settle with this
one<00:04:11.230> but<00:04:11.500> just<00:04:12.370> because<00:04:12.520> of<00:04:12.700> this<00:04:12.910> and<00:04:13.209> I'd

00:04:13.290 --> 00:04:13.300 
one but just because of this and I'd

00:04:13.300 --> 00:04:15.000 
one but just because of this and I'd
like<00:04:13.510> to<00:04:13.570> view<00:04:13.840> the<00:04:14.050> page<00:04:14.260> correctly<00:04:14.650> you<00:04:14.890> have

00:04:15.000 --> 00:04:15.010 
like to view the page correctly you have

00:04:15.010 --> 00:04:22.200 
like to view the page correctly you have
to<00:04:15.130> fold<00:04:15.520> it<00:04:15.730> together<00:04:16.049> like<00:04:17.049> that

00:04:22.200 --> 00:04:22.210 

00:04:22.210 --> 00:04:26.559 

but<00:04:23.210> I<00:04:24.610> mean<00:04:25.610> if<00:04:25.729> you<00:04:25.819> don't<00:04:25.909> really<00:04:26.240> care

00:04:26.559 --> 00:04:26.569 
but I mean if you don't really care

00:04:26.569 --> 00:04:28.390 
but I mean if you don't really care
about<00:04:26.810> that<00:04:27.020> sort<00:04:27.349> of<00:04:27.469> thing<00:04:27.530> this<00:04:27.889> is<00:04:28.099> a<00:04:28.129> nice
