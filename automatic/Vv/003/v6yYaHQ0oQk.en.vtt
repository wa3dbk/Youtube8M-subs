filming with right now I had this thing
for<00:00:09.750> a<00:00:09.780> little<00:00:09.929> while<00:00:10.230> but<00:00:10.530> I<00:00:10.590> haven't<00:00:10.860> tested

00:00:11.120 --> 00:00:11.130 
for a little while but I haven't tested

00:00:11.130 --> 00:00:13.490 
for a little while but I haven't tested
out<00:00:11.460> the<00:00:11.490> the<00:00:11.880> video<00:00:12.120> capability<00:00:12.809> too<00:00:12.990> much<00:00:13.200> so

00:00:13.490 --> 00:00:13.500 
out the the video capability too much so

00:00:13.500 --> 00:00:16.099 
out the the video capability too much so
I<00:00:13.710> can't<00:00:14.250> imagine<00:00:14.700> it's<00:00:15.179> as<00:00:15.299> good<00:00:15.450> as<00:00:15.570> my<00:00:15.690> Canon

00:00:16.099 --> 00:00:16.109 
I can't imagine it's as good as my Canon

00:00:16.109 --> 00:00:17.450 
I can't imagine it's as good as my Canon
doesn't<00:00:16.320> have<00:00:16.529> the<00:00:16.650> zoom<00:00:16.830> or<00:00:17.039> anything<00:00:17.220> like

00:00:17.450 --> 00:00:17.460 
doesn't have the zoom or anything like

00:00:17.460 --> 00:00:19.310 
doesn't have the zoom or anything like
that<00:00:17.520> but<00:00:17.910> decided<00:00:18.720> I<00:00:18.750> give<00:00:18.930> it<00:00:19.020> a<00:00:19.080> shot

00:00:19.310 --> 00:00:19.320 
that but decided I give it a shot

00:00:19.320 --> 00:00:20.840 
that but decided I give it a shot
because<00:00:19.560> it's<00:00:20.160> supposed<00:00:20.369> to<00:00:20.460> be<00:00:20.580> ready<00:00:20.789> to

00:00:20.840 --> 00:00:20.850 
because it's supposed to be ready to

00:00:20.850 --> 00:00:22.790 
because it's supposed to be ready to
pretty<00:00:21.090> high<00:00:21.270> so<00:00:21.689> either<00:00:21.869> way<00:00:22.109> let<00:00:22.560> me<00:00:22.619> show

00:00:22.790 --> 00:00:22.800

00:00:40.170 --> 00:00:42.229 
I'll tell you the four liter is a really
a<00:00:40.200> vast<00:00:40.469> improvement<00:00:40.739> the<00:00:41.250> old<00:00:41.399> one<00:00:41.579> I<00:00:41.790> didn't

00:00:42.229 --> 00:00:42.239 
a vast improvement the old one I didn't

00:00:42.239 --> 00:00:45.020 
a vast improvement the old one I didn't
realize<00:00:42.570> it<00:00:42.809> but<00:00:42.960> it<00:00:43.620> really<00:00:43.829> it<00:00:44.670> was<00:00:44.789> really

00:00:45.020 --> 00:00:45.030 
realize it but it really it was really

00:00:45.030 --> 00:00:47.180 
realize it but it really it was really
underpowered<00:00:45.420> the<00:00:45.780> three<00:00:45.989> liter<00:00:46.230> it<00:00:46.620> just

00:00:47.180 --> 00:00:47.190 
underpowered the three liter it just

00:00:47.190 --> 00:00:48.619 
underpowered the three liter it just
took<00:00:47.309> a<00:00:47.430> lot<00:00:47.610> to<00:00:47.640> get<00:00:47.910> it<00:00:48.059> moving<00:00:48.360> especially

00:00:48.619 --> 00:00:48.629 
took a lot to get it moving especially

00:00:48.629 --> 00:00:50.959 
took a lot to get it moving especially
in<00:00:49.020> traffic<00:00:49.260> so<00:00:50.039> I<00:00:50.100> can't<00:00:50.340> imagine<00:00:50.730> what<00:00:50.850> the

00:00:50.959 --> 00:00:50.969 
in traffic so I can't imagine what the

00:00:50.969 --> 00:00:52.760 
in traffic so I can't imagine what the
the<00:00:51.270> four<00:00:51.449> cylinder<00:00:51.690> was<00:00:51.989> like<00:00:52.170> I'm<00:00:52.320> sure<00:00:52.500> if

00:00:52.760 --> 00:00:52.770 
the four cylinder was like I'm sure if

00:00:52.770 --> 00:00:54.740 
the four cylinder was like I'm sure if
you're<00:00:52.920> on<00:00:53.010> a<00:00:53.039> country<00:00:53.399> road<00:00:53.430> just<00:00:54.120> cruising

00:00:54.750 --> 00:00:56.990 
you're on a country road just cruising
I<00:00:54.780> bet<00:00:55.260> it<00:00:55.350> does<00:00:55.379> great<00:00:55.680> on<00:00:55.890> gas<00:00:56.070> but<00:00:56.460> other

00:00:56.990 --> 00:00:57.000 
I bet it does great on gas but other

00:00:57.000 --> 00:00:58.939 
I bet it does great on gas but other
than<00:00:57.239> that<00:00:57.329> I<00:00:57.690> know<00:00:58.079> I'm<00:00:58.320> going<00:00:58.500> to<00:00:58.559> appreciate

00:01:10.640 --> 00:01:10.650 
have to replace the bumper but I got

00:01:10.650 --> 00:01:12.260

shining<00:01:11.070> up<00:01:11.189> a<00:01:11.280> little<00:01:11.460> bit<00:01:11.640> we<00:01:11.729> got<00:01:11.850> some<00:01:12.090> rust

00:01:12.260 --> 00:01:12.270 
shining up a little bit we got some rust

00:01:12.270 --> 00:01:14.390 
shining up a little bit we got some rust
but<00:01:12.600> it's<00:01:13.049> got<00:01:13.200> brand-new<00:01:13.530> headlights<00:01:14.100> and<00:01:14.280> a

00:01:14.390 --> 00:01:14.400

new<00:01:14.760> grille<00:01:15.060> I<00:01:15.330> actually<00:01:15.720> thought<00:01:16.020> that<00:01:16.080> the

00:01:16.450 --> 00:01:16.460 
new grille I actually thought that the

00:01:16.460 --> 00:01:19.490 
new grille I actually thought that the
2002<00:01:17.460> was<00:01:17.700> supposed<00:01:17.970> to<00:01:18.060> have<00:01:18.270> a<00:01:18.500> honeycomb

00:01:19.490 --> 00:01:19.500 
2002 was supposed to have a honeycomb

00:01:19.500 --> 00:01:22.520 
2002 was supposed to have a honeycomb
grille<00:01:19.799> but<00:01:20.009> that<00:01:20.460> must<00:01:20.670> be<00:01:20.729> o3<00:01:21.270> and<00:01:21.420> then<00:01:22.140> the

00:01:22.520 --> 00:01:22.530 
grille but that must be o3 and then the

00:01:22.530 --> 00:01:24.950 
grille but that must be o3 and then the
other<00:01:22.650> thing<00:01:22.890> we<00:01:22.979> gotta<00:01:23.159> fix<00:01:23.430> is<00:01:23.840> this<00:01:24.840> is

00:01:24.950 --> 00:01:24.960 
other thing we gotta fix is this is

00:01:24.960 --> 00:01:27.140 
other thing we gotta fix is this is
actually<00:01:25.259> an<00:01:25.320> aftermarket<00:01:25.740> fender<00:01:26.280> here<00:01:26.490> the

00:01:27.140 --> 00:01:27.150 
actually an aftermarket fender here the

00:01:27.150 --> 00:01:28.850 
actually an aftermarket fender here the
old<00:01:27.270> one<00:01:27.420> must<00:01:27.630> have<00:01:27.720> got<00:01:27.869> scratched<00:01:28.470> up<00:01:28.680> or

00:01:28.850 --> 00:01:28.860 
old one must have got scratched up or

00:01:28.860 --> 00:01:30.230 
old one must have got scratched up or
something<00:01:29.159> so<00:01:29.400> they<00:01:29.520> replaced<00:01:29.880> it<00:01:30.000> with<00:01:30.060> an

00:01:30.230 --> 00:01:30.240 
something so they replaced it with an

00:01:30.240 --> 00:01:32.630 
something so they replaced it with an
aftermarket<00:01:30.540> and<00:01:31.020> it<00:01:31.799> just<00:01:32.159> doesn't<00:01:32.340> line<00:01:32.610> up

00:01:32.630 --> 00:01:32.640 
aftermarket and it just doesn't line up

00:01:32.640 --> 00:01:34.760 
aftermarket and it just doesn't line up
so<00:01:33.329> I'm<00:01:33.450> going<00:01:33.570> to<00:01:33.600> replace<00:01:33.869> that<00:01:34.140> and<00:01:34.560> then

00:01:34.760 --> 00:01:34.770 
so I'm going to replace that and then

00:01:34.770 --> 00:01:37.490 
so I'm going to replace that and then
that<00:01:35.009> will<00:01:35.280> get<00:01:35.430> that<00:01:35.579> looking<00:01:35.939> good<00:01:35.990> but<00:01:36.990> it's

00:01:37.490 --> 00:01:37.500 
that will get that looking good but it's

00:01:37.500 --> 00:01:39.289 
that will get that looking good but it's
got<00:01:37.619> a<00:01:37.650> nice<00:01:37.860> bed<00:01:38.070> liner<00:01:38.369> in<00:01:38.670> it<00:01:38.759> actually

00:01:39.289 --> 00:01:39.299 
got a nice bed liner in it actually

00:01:39.299 --> 00:01:41.060 
got a nice bed liner in it actually
that's<00:01:39.509> right<00:01:39.780> in<00:01:39.930> line<00:01:39.960> or<00:01:40.320> spray-on<00:01:40.560> paint

00:01:41.060 --> 00:01:41.070 
that's right in line or spray-on paint

00:01:41.070 --> 00:01:43.550 
that's right in line or spray-on paint
on<00:01:41.250> however<00:01:41.640> they<00:01:41.850> do<00:01:41.909> that<00:01:42.259> so<00:01:43.259> I'm<00:01:43.350> happy

00:01:43.550 --> 00:01:43.560 
on however they do that so I'm happy

00:01:43.560 --> 00:01:46.219 
on however they do that so I'm happy
with<00:01:43.680> that<00:01:44.009> and<00:01:44.220> it's<00:01:44.310> got<00:01:44.460> these<00:01:44.670> uh<00:01:44.729> I<00:01:45.240> think

00:01:46.219 --> 00:01:46.229 
with that and it's got these uh I think

00:01:46.229 --> 00:01:48.499 
with that and it's got these uh I think
those<00:01:46.350> are<00:01:46.530> for<00:01:46.649> a<00:01:46.710> cap<00:01:47.060> these<00:01:48.060> things<00:01:48.299> because

00:01:48.499 --> 00:01:48.509 
those are for a cap these things because

00:01:48.509 --> 00:01:51.109 
those are for a cap these things because
it's<00:01:48.659> got<00:01:49.049> some<00:01:49.310> got<00:01:50.310> these<00:01:50.430> screws<00:01:50.759> in<00:01:50.939> there

00:01:51.109 --> 00:01:51.119 
it's got some got these screws in there

00:01:51.119 --> 00:01:52.520 
it's got some got these screws in there
so<00:01:51.360> that's<00:01:51.600> what<00:01:51.720> I<00:01:51.840> was<00:01:51.930> figuring<00:01:52.259> that<00:01:52.380> was

00:01:52.520 --> 00:01:52.530 
so that's what I was figuring that was

00:01:52.530 --> 00:01:55.010 
so that's what I was figuring that was
for<00:01:52.770> but<00:01:53.549> whatever<00:01:53.909> it<00:01:54.180> is<00:01:54.299> looks<00:01:54.630> pretty<00:01:54.869> good

00:01:55.010 --> 00:01:55.020 
for but whatever it is looks pretty good

00:01:55.020 --> 00:01:57.859 
for but whatever it is looks pretty good
I'm<00:01:55.259> happy<00:01:55.380> with<00:01:55.680> that<00:01:55.860> and<00:01:56.509> frame<00:01:57.509> is<00:01:57.659> in<00:01:57.719> good

00:01:57.859 --> 00:01:57.869 
I'm happy with that and frame is in good

00:01:57.869 --> 00:01:58.940 
I'm happy with that and frame is in good
shape<00:01:57.930> I<00:01:58.350> haven't<00:01:58.590> really<00:01:58.770> crawled

00:01:58.940 --> 00:01:58.950 
shape I haven't really crawled

00:01:58.950 --> 00:02:00.980 
shape I haven't really crawled
underneath<00:01:59.310> it<00:01:59.579> too<00:01:59.729> much<00:01:59.939> but<00:02:00.240> from<00:02:00.840> what<00:02:00.960> I

00:02:00.980 --> 00:02:00.990 
underneath it too much but from what I

00:02:00.990 --> 00:02:02.569 
underneath it too much but from what I
can<00:02:01.140> tell<00:02:01.290> I<00:02:01.500> actually<00:02:01.979> it's<00:02:02.219> been<00:02:02.340> under

00:02:02.569 --> 00:02:02.579 
can tell I actually it's been under

00:02:02.579 --> 00:02:04.399 
can tell I actually it's been under
coated<00:02:02.939> you<00:02:03.540> got<00:02:03.689> it<00:02:03.840> on<00:02:03.960> you<00:02:04.079> guys<00:02:04.170> but<00:02:04.350> I

00:02:04.399 --> 00:02:04.409 
coated you got it on you guys but I

00:02:04.409 --> 00:02:05.149 
coated you got it on you guys but I
can't<00:02:04.469> see<00:02:04.829> a<00:02:04.860> thing

00:02:05.149 --> 00:02:05.159 
can't see a thing

00:02:05.159 --> 00:02:07.310 
can't see a thing
I<00:02:05.399> don't<00:02:05.790> have<00:02:05.880> a<00:02:05.969> light<00:02:06.509> on<00:02:06.689> or<00:02:06.899> anything<00:02:07.110> but

00:02:07.310 --> 00:02:07.320 
I don't have a light on or anything but

00:02:07.320 --> 00:02:09.169 
I don't have a light on or anything but
it's<00:02:07.920> been<00:02:08.099> under<00:02:08.340> coated<00:02:08.700> so<00:02:08.849> I<00:02:08.879> don't<00:02:09.119> think

00:02:09.169 --> 00:02:09.179 
it's been under coated so I don't think

00:02:09.179 --> 00:02:10.550 
it's been under coated so I don't think
it's<00:02:09.390> going<00:02:09.509> to<00:02:09.569> have<00:02:09.690> the<00:02:09.810> rot<00:02:09.989> and<00:02:10.110> rust<00:02:10.289> like

00:02:10.550 --> 00:02:10.560 
it's going to have the rot and rust like

00:02:10.560 --> 00:02:11.520 
it's going to have the rot and rust like
the<00:02:10.679> other<00:02:10.860> one<00:02:11.039> did

00:02:11.520 --> 00:02:11.530 
the other one did

00:02:11.530 --> 00:02:13.920 
the other one did
and<00:02:11.800> I<00:02:12.040> think<00:02:12.400> I<00:02:12.490> kind<00:02:12.670> of<00:02:12.820> contributed<00:02:13.420> there

00:02:13.920 --> 00:02:13.930 
and I think I kind of contributed there

00:02:13.930 --> 00:02:17.100 
and I think I kind of contributed there
goes<00:02:14.080> my<00:02:14.910> top-of-line<00:02:15.910> smartphone<00:02:16.570> focusing

00:02:17.100 --> 00:02:17.110 
goes my top-of-line smartphone focusing

00:02:17.110 --> 00:02:20.160 
goes my top-of-line smartphone focusing
there<00:02:17.260> you<00:02:17.350> go<00:02:18.600> this<00:02:19.600> is<00:02:19.660> not<00:02:19.900> going<00:02:19.990> to<00:02:20.080> have

00:02:20.160 --> 00:02:20.170 
there you go this is not going to have

00:02:20.170 --> 00:02:21.240 
there you go this is not going to have
the<00:02:20.260> rotten<00:02:20.560> rust<00:02:20.770> which<00:02:20.950> I<00:02:21.070> think

00:02:21.240 --> 00:02:21.250 
the rotten rust which I think

00:02:21.250 --> 00:02:22.560 
the rotten rust which I think
contributed<00:02:21.820> to<00:02:21.940> the<00:02:22.030> reason<00:02:22.330> then<00:02:22.450> what

00:02:22.560 --> 00:02:22.570 
contributed to the reason then what

00:02:22.570 --> 00:02:24.930 
contributed to the reason then what
other<00:02:22.720> one<00:02:22.930> got<00:02:23.110> busted<00:02:23.530> up<00:02:23.680> so<00:02:23.860> bad<00:02:24.100> I<00:02:24.370> got<00:02:24.820> to

00:02:24.930 --> 00:02:24.940 
other one got busted up so bad I got to

00:02:24.940 --> 00:02:26.520 
other one got busted up so bad I got to
pick<00:02:25.060> up<00:02:25.180> a<00:02:25.330> hitch<00:02:25.480> work<00:02:25.840> that's<00:02:26.080> no<00:02:26.290> big<00:02:26.500> deal

00:02:26.520 --> 00:02:26.530 
pick up a hitch work that's no big deal

00:02:26.530 --> 00:02:29.910 
pick up a hitch work that's no big deal
and<00:02:27.120> the<00:02:28.120> interior<00:02:28.600> is<00:02:28.630> pretty<00:02:28.720> nice<00:02:29.080> too<00:02:29.140> it's

00:02:29.910 --> 00:02:29.920 
and the interior is pretty nice too it's

00:02:29.920 --> 00:02:32.370 
and the interior is pretty nice too it's
um<00:02:30.220> it's<00:02:30.940> tan<00:02:31.240> as<00:02:31.450> opposed<00:02:31.690> to<00:02:31.810> gray<00:02:32.020> within

00:02:32.370 --> 00:02:32.380 
um it's tan as opposed to gray within

00:02:32.380 --> 00:02:34.470 
um it's tan as opposed to gray within
the<00:02:32.500> other<00:02:32.590> one<00:02:32.860> I<00:02:33.130> I<00:02:33.490> didn't<00:02:33.970> used<00:02:34.240> to<00:02:34.300> like

00:02:34.470 --> 00:02:34.480 
the other one I I didn't used to like

00:02:34.480 --> 00:02:35.670 
the other one I I didn't used to like
the<00:02:34.600> tan<00:02:34.810> but<00:02:35.110> it<00:02:35.170> actually<00:02:35.290> looks<00:02:35.590> pretty

00:02:35.670 --> 00:02:35.680 
the tan but it actually looks pretty

00:02:35.680 --> 00:02:38.460 
the tan but it actually looks pretty
good<00:02:35.890> I<00:02:36.220> like<00:02:36.490> it<00:02:36.520> and<00:02:36.810> the<00:02:37.810> other<00:02:37.930> cool<00:02:38.140> thing

00:02:38.460 --> 00:02:38.470 
good I like it and the other cool thing

00:02:38.470 --> 00:02:40.830 
good I like it and the other cool thing
is<00:02:38.650> you<00:02:39.160> got<00:02:39.310> this<00:02:39.520> instead<00:02:40.390> of<00:02:40.450> a<00:02:40.570> center

00:02:40.830 --> 00:02:40.840 
is you got this instead of a center

00:02:40.840 --> 00:02:42.780 
is you got this instead of a center

00:02:42.780 --> 00:02:42.790 
console you got this little little

00:02:42.790 --> 00:02:45.300 
console you got this little little
console<00:02:43.510> and<00:02:43.630> you<00:02:43.660> flip<00:02:43.900> that<00:02:44.050> up<00:02:44.320> and<00:02:44.530> you<00:02:45.160> got

00:02:45.300 --> 00:02:45.310 
console and you flip that up and you got

00:02:45.310 --> 00:02:47.370

extra<00:02:45.670> extra<00:02:46.180> space<00:02:46.420> there<00:02:46.450> do<00:02:46.930> whatever<00:02:47.110> it

00:02:47.370 --> 00:02:47.380 
extra extra space there do whatever it

00:02:47.380 --> 00:02:49.140 
extra extra space there do whatever it
is<00:02:47.440> you're<00:02:47.650> trying<00:02:47.800> to<00:02:48.010> do<00:02:48.190> because<00:02:48.370> I<00:02:48.670> know

00:02:49.140 --> 00:02:49.150 
is you're trying to do because I know

00:02:49.150 --> 00:02:50.520 
is you're trying to do because I know
you<00:02:49.270> can't<00:02:49.540> fit<00:02:49.720> another<00:02:49.750> person<00:02:50.380> there

00:02:50.520 --> 00:02:50.530 
you can't fit another person there

00:02:50.530 --> 00:02:51.930 
you can't fit another person there
unless<00:02:50.739> it's<00:02:50.950> like<00:02:51.100> a<00:02:51.130> little<00:02:51.640> kid<00:02:51.820> or

something<00:02:52.150> but<00:02:52.900> either<00:02:52.989> way<00:02:53.230> I<00:02:53.260> thought<00:02:53.590> that

00:02:53.760 --> 00:02:53.770 
something but either way I thought that

00:02:53.770 --> 00:02:55.350 
something but either way I thought that
was<00:02:53.890> kind<00:02:54.040> of<00:02:54.070> cool<00:02:54.250> it's<00:02:54.459> got<00:02:54.580> got<00:02:55.090> cruise

00:02:55.350 --> 00:02:55.360 
was kind of cool it's got got cruise

00:02:55.360 --> 00:02:57.030 
was kind of cool it's got got cruise
control<00:02:55.390> that's<00:02:56.170> an<00:02:56.350> upgrade<00:02:56.500> didn't<00:02:56.920> have

00:02:57.030 --> 00:02:57.040 
control that's an upgrade didn't have

00:02:57.040 --> 00:02:59.729 
control that's an upgrade didn't have
that<00:02:57.190> in<00:02:57.340> the<00:02:57.400> old<00:02:57.550> truck<00:02:57.850> and<00:02:58.030> it's<00:02:58.870> also<00:02:58.989> got

00:02:59.729 --> 00:02:59.739 
that in the old truck and it's also got

00:02:59.739 --> 00:03:01.380 
that in the old truck and it's also got
a<00:02:59.770> CD<00:03:00.130> player<00:03:00.160> which<00:03:00.850> I<00:03:00.970> actually<00:03:01.090> kind<00:03:01.360> of

00:03:01.380 --> 00:03:01.390 
a CD player which I actually kind of

00:03:01.390 --> 00:03:03.750 
a CD player which I actually kind of
preferred<00:03:01.720> the<00:03:02.160> tape<00:03:03.160> deck<00:03:03.370> because<00:03:03.550> I<00:03:03.640> had

00:03:03.750 --> 00:03:03.760 
preferred the tape deck because I had

00:03:03.760 --> 00:03:05.790 
preferred the tape deck because I had
that<00:03:03.880> adapter<00:03:04.360> I<00:03:04.390> could<00:03:04.600> plug<00:03:04.750> in<00:03:04.959> my<00:03:05.380> phone<00:03:05.410> do

00:03:05.790 --> 00:03:05.800 
that adapter I could plug in my phone do

00:03:05.800 --> 00:03:08.010 
that adapter I could plug in my phone do

00:03:08.010 --> 00:03:08.020 
but we'll see I might try and find one

00:03:08.020 --> 00:03:10.560 
but we'll see I might try and find one

00:03:10.570 --> 00:03:12.630 
swap it out but other than that it's a
just<00:03:11.200> about<00:03:11.410> the<00:03:11.590> same<00:03:11.830> so<00:03:12.130> I'm<00:03:12.310> real<00:03:12.520> happy
