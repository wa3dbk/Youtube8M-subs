animatronics<00:01:56.790> not<00:01:56.969> children<00:01:57.509> nothing<00:01:58.170> makes

00:01:58.429 --> 00:01:58.439 
animatronics not children nothing makes

00:01:58.439 --> 00:02:01.490 
animatronics not children nothing makes
the<00:01:58.979> shadows<00:01:59.520> except<00:02:00.180> this<00:02:00.509> too<00:02:00.960> well<00:02:01.290> I

00:02:01.490 --> 00:02:01.500 
the shadows except this too well I

00:02:01.500 --> 00:02:04.130 
the shadows except this too well I
suggest<00:02:02.009> that<00:02:02.340> Scott<00:02:02.729> did<00:02:03.000> make<00:02:03.329> the<00:02:03.659> shadow

00:02:04.130 --> 00:02:04.140 
suggest that Scott did make the shadow

00:02:04.140 --> 00:02:06.980 
suggest that Scott did make the shadow
just<00:02:04.680> for<00:02:05.040> fun<00:02:05.340> to<00:02:05.610> troll<00:02:05.880> the<00:02:05.939> place<00:02:06.360> and<00:02:06.689> let

00:02:06.980 --> 00:02:06.990 
just for fun to troll the place and let

00:02:06.990 --> 00:02:09.680 
just for fun to troll the place and let
them<00:02:07.259> thinking<00:02:07.829> about<00:02:07.950> that<00:02:08.399> is<00:02:08.910> the<00:02:09.360> shadow

00:02:09.680 --> 00:02:09.690 
them thinking about that is the shadow

00:02:09.690 --> 00:02:12.410 
them thinking about that is the shadow
animatronics<00:02:10.590> or<00:02:10.830> that<00:02:11.129> just<00:02:11.580> the<00:02:11.940> usual

00:02:12.410 --> 00:02:12.420 
animatronics or that just the usual

00:02:12.420 --> 00:02:13.460 
animatronics or that just the usual
shadows<00:02:12.959> for

00:02:13.460 --> 00:02:13.470 
shadows for

00:02:13.470 --> 00:02:16.160 
shadows for
now<00:02:13.620> I<00:02:13.890> think<00:02:14.070> that<00:02:14.610> it's<00:02:14.880> the<00:02:15.330> real<00:02:15.570> shadows

00:02:16.160 --> 00:02:16.170 
now I think that it's the real shadows

00:02:16.170 --> 00:02:17.960 
now I think that it's the real shadows
and<00:02:16.440> Fred<00:02:16.770> were<00:02:16.950> and<00:02:17.160> sprinter<00:02:17.670> op<00:02:17.760> are

00:02:17.960 --> 00:02:17.970 
and Fred were and sprinter op are

00:02:17.970 --> 00:02:20.960 
and Fred were and sprinter op are
actually<00:02:18.780> the<00:02:19.170> sources<00:02:19.950> of<00:02:20.100> these<00:02:20.460> shadows

00:02:20.960 --> 00:02:20.970 
actually the sources of these shadows

00:02:20.970 --> 00:02:23.450 
actually the sources of these shadows
and<00:02:21.210> more<00:02:21.720> than<00:02:21.870> that<00:02:22.140> they<00:02:22.410> are<00:02:22.650> stayin<00:02:23.190> at

00:02:23.450 --> 00:02:23.460 
and more than that they are stayin at

00:02:23.460 --> 00:02:26.510 
and more than that they are stayin at
the<00:02:23.700> stage<00:02:23.970> even<00:02:24.360> at<00:02:24.660> the<00:02:24.840> 93<00:02:25.470> and<00:02:25.710> then<00:02:26.220> we

00:02:26.510 --> 00:02:26.520 
the stage even at the 93 and then we

00:02:26.520 --> 00:02:28.550 
the stage even at the 93 and then we
come<00:02:26.760> to<00:02:26.790> the<00:02:27.090> interesting<00:02:27.840> part<00:02:28.080> of<00:02:28.260> this

00:02:28.550 --> 00:02:28.560 
come to the interesting part of this

00:02:28.560 --> 00:02:31.370 
come to the interesting part of this
theory<00:02:29.160> we<00:02:29.640> have<00:02:29.910> these<00:02:30.390> two<00:02:30.660> animatronics

00:02:31.370 --> 00:02:31.380 
theory we have these two animatronics

00:02:31.380 --> 00:02:33.290 
theory we have these two animatronics
which<00:02:31.560> we<00:02:31.710> can<00:02:31.890> see<00:02:32.100> in<00:02:32.310> the<00:02:32.580> right<00:02:32.820> room<00:02:33.060> and

00:02:33.290 --> 00:02:33.300 
which we can see in the right room and

00:02:33.300 --> 00:02:36.530 
which we can see in the right room and
also<00:02:34.080> today<00:02:34.710> we<00:02:34.950> received<00:02:35.070> an<00:02:35.490> evidence<00:02:36.090> that

00:02:36.530 --> 00:02:36.540 
also today we received an evidence that

00:02:36.540 --> 00:02:39.170 
also today we received an evidence that
two<00:02:36.840> animatronics<00:02:37.560> on<00:02:37.710> the<00:02:37.860> stage<00:02:38.160> are<00:02:38.520> at<00:02:38.970> the

00:02:39.170 --> 00:02:39.180 
two animatronics on the stage are at the

00:02:39.180 --> 00:02:41.660 
two animatronics on the stage are at the
stage<00:02:39.480> even<00:02:39.960> at<00:02:40.140> the<00:02:40.320> night<00:02:40.560> three<00:02:40.980> it<00:02:41.280> means

00:02:41.660 --> 00:02:41.670 
stage even at the night three it means

00:02:41.670 --> 00:02:44.630 
stage even at the night three it means
that<00:02:41.940> this<00:02:42.360> pizzeria<00:02:43.050> has<00:02:43.440> four<00:02:43.980> suits<00:02:44.370> at

00:02:44.630 --> 00:02:44.640 
that this pizzeria has four suits at

00:02:44.640 --> 00:02:47.750 
that this pizzeria has four suits at
once<00:02:45.090> and<00:02:45.480> actually<00:02:46.230> all<00:02:46.470> of<00:02:46.500> them<00:02:46.980> we<00:02:47.280> can<00:02:47.520> see

00:02:47.750 --> 00:02:47.760 
once and actually all of them we can see

00:02:47.760 --> 00:02:50.180 
once and actually all of them we can see
at<00:02:47.970> the<00:02:48.150> Nile<00:02:48.390> three<00:02:48.810> at<00:02:49.230> least<00:02:49.350> two<00:02:49.800> spring

00:02:50.180 --> 00:02:50.190 
at the Nile three at least two spring

00:02:50.190 --> 00:02:52.340 
at the Nile three at least two spring
drops<00:02:50.490> and<00:02:50.760> at<00:02:51.000> least<00:02:51.209> two<00:02:51.570> Fred<00:02:51.900> worse<00:02:52.110> of

00:02:52.340 --> 00:02:52.350 
drops and at least two Fred worse of

00:02:52.350 --> 00:02:54.470 
drops and at least two Fred worse of
course<00:02:52.770> we<00:02:52.950> didn't<00:02:53.370> see<00:02:53.580> someone<00:02:54.120> in<00:02:54.300> the

00:02:54.470 --> 00:02:54.480 
course we didn't see someone in the

00:02:54.480 --> 00:02:56.900 
course we didn't see someone in the
animatronics<00:02:55.170> from<00:02:55.380> the<00:02:55.560> stage<00:02:55.890> but<00:02:56.190> I<00:02:56.370> assume

00:02:56.900 --> 00:02:56.910 
animatronics from the stage but I assume

00:02:56.910 --> 00:02:59.480 
animatronics from the stage but I assume
that<00:02:57.450> the<00:02:57.690> suits<00:02:58.050> from<00:02:58.380> the<00:02:58.590> stage<00:02:58.890> are<00:02:59.130> the

00:02:59.480 --> 00:02:59.490 
that the suits from the stage are the

00:02:59.490 --> 00:03:02.210 
that the suits from the stage are the
same<00:02:59.850> with<00:03:00.209> the<00:03:00.570> ones<00:03:00.780> in<00:03:01.050> the<00:03:01.110> right<00:03:01.650> room<00:03:01.950> I

00:03:02.210 --> 00:03:02.220 
same with the ones in the right room I

00:03:02.220 --> 00:03:04.820 
same with the ones in the right room I
suggest<00:03:02.880> that<00:03:03.150> based<00:03:03.480> on<00:03:03.720> the<00:03:04.020> same<00:03:04.320> look<00:03:04.650> of

00:03:04.820 --> 00:03:04.830 
suggest that based on the same look of

00:03:04.830 --> 00:03:07.310 
suggest that based on the same look of
renders<00:03:05.459> I<00:03:05.760> mean<00:03:06.270> if<00:03:06.540> they<00:03:06.810> look<00:03:07.050> the<00:03:07.290> same

00:03:07.310 --> 00:03:07.320 
renders I mean if they look the same

00:03:07.320 --> 00:03:11.240 
renders I mean if they look the same
then<00:03:07.950> there<00:03:08.459> are<00:03:08.790> both<00:03:09.090> the<00:03:09.810> suits<00:03:10.140> or<00:03:10.440> not<00:03:11.010> the

00:03:11.240 --> 00:03:11.250 
then there are both the suits or not the

00:03:11.250 --> 00:03:13.880 
then there are both the suits or not the
suits<00:03:11.550> and<00:03:11.790> we<00:03:12.240> saw<00:03:12.510> one<00:03:12.810> of<00:03:12.990> them<00:03:13.200> being<00:03:13.530> used

00:03:13.880 --> 00:03:13.890 
suits and we saw one of them being used

00:03:13.890 --> 00:03:16.610 
suits and we saw one of them being used
as<00:03:14.100> a<00:03:14.430> suit<00:03:14.910> in<00:03:15.150> the<00:03:15.209> right<00:03:15.600> room<00:03:15.900> it<00:03:16.200> means

00:03:16.610 --> 00:03:16.620 
as a suit in the right room it means

00:03:16.620 --> 00:03:19.910 
as a suit in the right room it means
that<00:03:16.920> they<00:03:17.280> both<00:03:17.519> are<00:03:17.910> suits<00:03:18.480> well<00:03:19.200> I<00:03:19.230> hope<00:03:19.769> you

00:03:19.910 --> 00:03:19.920 
that they both are suits well I hope you

00:03:19.920 --> 00:03:21.560 
that they both are suits well I hope you
understood<00:03:20.340> what<00:03:20.400> I've<00:03:20.670> said<00:03:20.880> just<00:03:21.150> now<00:03:21.209> but

00:03:21.560 --> 00:03:21.570 
understood what I've said just now but

00:03:21.570 --> 00:03:23.930 
understood what I've said just now but
of<00:03:21.810> course<00:03:22.050> is<00:03:22.320> just<00:03:22.769> an<00:03:22.950> suggestion<00:03:23.760> though

00:03:23.930 --> 00:03:23.940 
of course is just an suggestion though

00:03:23.940 --> 00:03:27.140 
of course is just an suggestion though
it's<00:03:24.510> interesting<00:03:24.900> why<00:03:25.440> are<00:03:25.769> there<00:03:26.220> four<00:03:26.670> suit

00:03:27.140 --> 00:03:27.150 
it's interesting why are there four suit

00:03:27.150 --> 00:03:29.810 
it's interesting why are there four suit
