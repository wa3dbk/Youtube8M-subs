you<00:02:54.290> can<00:02:54.500> see<00:02:54.770> it

00:03:00.780 --> 00:03:00.790 

00:03:00.790 --> 00:03:02.860 

and<00:03:01.120> put<00:03:01.420> them

00:03:13.850 --> 00:03:25.350 

hot<00:03:14.450> over<00:03:15.050> here

00:03:25.350 --> 00:03:25.360 

00:03:25.360 --> 00:03:33.030 

so<00:03:25.840> should<00:03:26.050> take<00:03:26.260> some<00:03:26.470> pictures<00:03:26.950> to

00:03:33.030 --> 00:03:33.040

00:03:50.760 --> 00:03:50.770 

00:03:50.770 --> 00:03:58.870 

now<00:03:51.770> these<00:03:53.709> are<00:03:54.709> usually<00:03:54.980> mostly<00:03:55.610> girls<00:03:57.880> women

00:03:58.870 --> 00:03:58.880 
now these are usually mostly girls women

00:03:58.880 --> 00:04:03.330 
now these are usually mostly girls women
workers<00:03:59.120> and<00:03:59.630> then<00:03:59.959> you<00:04:00.140> have<00:04:00.349> a<00:04:00.910> few<00:04:01.910> boys

00:04:03.330 --> 00:04:03.340 
workers and then you have a few boys

00:04:03.340 --> 00:04:06.699 
workers and then you have a few boys
that<00:04:04.340> are<00:04:04.459> used<00:04:04.670> basically<00:04:05.150> for<00:04:05.480> one<00:04:06.380> purpose

00:04:06.699 --> 00:04:06.709 
that are used basically for one purpose

00:04:06.709 --> 00:04:09.960 
that are used basically for one purpose
and<00:04:07.090> then<00:04:08.090> they're<00:04:08.269> kicked<00:04:08.510> out<00:04:08.690> of<00:04:08.720> the<00:04:08.900> hive

00:04:09.960 --> 00:04:09.970 
and then they're kicked out of the hive

00:04:09.970 --> 00:04:14.410 
and then they're kicked out of the hive
we<00:04:10.970> don't<00:04:11.180> need<00:04:11.330> to<00:04:11.510> go<00:04:11.930> into<00:04:12.140> the<00:04:12.349> purpose<00:04:13.420> but

00:04:14.410 --> 00:04:14.420 
we don't need to go into the purpose but

00:04:14.420 --> 00:04:19.960 
we don't need to go into the purpose but
the<00:04:14.540> girls<00:04:14.810> do<00:04:15.050> the<00:04:15.170> world

00:05:05.840 --> 00:05:05.850 
put it into a hive to get a hive started

00:05:05.850 --> 00:05:09.080 
put it into a hive to get a hive started
this<00:05:05.970> is<00:05:06.180> a<00:05:06.210> ten<00:05:06.570> frame<00:05:06.810> hive<00:05:07.259> and<00:05:07.940> we<00:05:08.940> will

this is a ten frame hive and we will

00:05:09.090 --> 00:05:12.200 
this is a ten frame hive and we will
keep<00:05:09.240> checking<00:05:09.660> back<00:05:10.250> each<00:05:11.250> week<00:05:11.550> so<00:05:11.880> you<00:05:11.940> can
