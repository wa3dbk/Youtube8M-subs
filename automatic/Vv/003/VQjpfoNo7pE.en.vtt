the lesson for both of these books is

00:03:40.790 --> 00:03:42.789 
the lesson for both of these books is
that<00:03:41.209> you<00:03:41.540> know<00:03:41.630> my<00:03:41.750> ego<00:03:42.200> called<00:03:42.440> it<00:03:42.560> like<00:03:42.620> the

00:03:42.789 --> 00:03:42.799 
that you know my ego called it like the

00:03:42.799 --> 00:03:44.770 
that you know my ego called it like the
five<00:03:43.010> percent<00:03:43.609> rule<00:03:43.790> calipari<00:03:44.389> i<00:03:44.480> think<00:03:44.690> i'd

00:03:44.770 --> 00:03:44.780 
five percent rule calipari i think i'd

00:03:44.780 --> 00:03:46.750 
five percent rule calipari i think i'd
like<00:03:44.840> to<00:03:45.019> two<00:03:45.260> percent<00:03:45.470> rule<00:03:46.250> over<00:03:46.430> the<00:03:46.519> point

00:03:46.750 --> 00:03:46.760 
like to two percent rule over the point

00:03:46.760 --> 00:03:48.610 
like to two percent rule over the point
is<00:03:46.970> is<00:03:47.180> that<00:03:47.209> that<00:03:47.540> number<00:03:47.870> of<00:03:48.200> successful

00:03:48.610 --> 00:03:48.620

is is that that number of successful
people<00:03:48.799> is<00:03:49.190> significantly<00:03:50.060> smaller<00:03:50.290> so<00:03:51.290> in

00:03:51.520 --> 00:03:51.530 
people is significantly smaller so in

00:03:51.530 --> 00:03:53.349 
people is significantly smaller so in
order<00:03:51.739> for<00:03:51.889> you<00:03:52.280> to<00:03:52.310> be<00:03:52.459> successful<00:03:52.760> you're
