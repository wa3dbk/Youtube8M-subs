00:00:59.939 --> 00:00:59.949 
they fly to a new runway and just as

00:00:59.949 --> 00:01:01.559 
they fly to a new runway and just as
easily<00:01:00.129> is<00:01:00.399> the<00:01:00.429> ability<00:01:00.760> to<00:01:00.940> vector<00:01:01.449> an

easily is the ability to vector an
aircraft<00:01:01.989> a<00:01:02.319> vector<00:01:03.129> is<00:01:03.280> basically<00:01:03.699> a<00:01:04.030> heading

00:01:04.439 --> 00:01:04.449

00:01:07.080 --> 00:01:07.090 
assignment and that's Terra that's very

00:01:07.090 --> 00:01:08.969 
assignment and that's Terra that's very
useful<00:01:07.270> with<00:01:07.869> air<00:01:08.049> for<00:01:08.200> minus<00:01:08.439> three<00:01:08.649> we<00:01:08.770> had

00:01:08.969 --> 00:01:08.979 
useful with air for minus three we had

the<00:01:40.090> choppiness<00:01:40.509> of<00:01:40.750> this<00:01:40.869> animation<00:01:41.259> it's

00:01:41.550 --> 00:01:41.560 
the choppiness of this animation it's

00:01:41.560 --> 00:01:46.139 
the choppiness of this animation it's
mainly<00:01:42.369> due<00:01:42.579> to<00:01:42.609> a<00:01:43.270> my<00:01:44.020> laptop<00:01:44.530> and<00:01:44.770> B<00:01:45.130> my<00:01:45.369> video

00:01:46.139 --> 00:01:46.149 
mainly due to a my laptop and B my video

00:01:46.149 --> 00:01:48.419 
mainly due to a my laptop and B my video
recording<00:01:46.630> software<00:01:46.829> it's<00:01:47.829> a<00:01:47.950> bit<00:01:48.100> too<00:01:48.280> much

00:01:48.419 --> 00:01:48.429 
recording software it's a bit too much

00:01:48.429 --> 00:01:50.969 
recording software it's a bit too much
for<00:01:48.670> my<00:01:48.759> CPU<00:01:49.240> so<00:01:50.049> you<00:01:50.109> will<00:01:50.320> see<00:01:50.530> some<00:01:50.560> stutter

00:01:50.969 --> 00:01:50.979 
for my CPU so you will see some stutter

00:01:50.979 --> 00:01:53.279 
for my CPU so you will see some stutter
which<00:01:51.789> I<00:01:51.909> assure<00:01:52.210> you<00:01:52.240> was<00:01:52.450> not<00:01:52.600> there<00:01:52.960> when

00:01:53.279 --> 00:01:53.289 
which I assure you was not there when

00:01:53.289 --> 00:02:00.330 
which I assure you was not there when
you<00:01:53.469> play<00:01:53.890> the<00:01:54.009> game<00:01:58.710> the<00:01:59.710> ability<00:01:59.979> to<00:02:00.039> give<00:02:00.219> an

00:02:00.330 --> 00:02:00.340 
you play the game the ability to give an

you play the game the ability to give an
immediate<00:02:00.670> takeoff<00:02:01.210> clearance<00:02:01.479> is<00:02:01.840> very

00:02:02.160 --> 00:02:02.170 
immediate takeoff clearance is very

00:02:02.170 --> 00:02:11.589 
immediate takeoff clearance is very
handy<00:02:02.679> when<00:02:03.429> you<00:02:03.549> get<00:02:03.729> into<00:02:04.030> a<00:02:04.060> tight<00:02:04.390> spot
