00:00:21.400 --> 00:00:24.289
 one by one 

00:00:24.289 --> 00:00:26.089
 one does not 

00:00:26.089 --> 00:00:28.699
 your Indian's 

00:00:28.699 --> 00:00:31.890
 after a while you learn different 

00:00:31.890 --> 00:00:36.610
 the subtle difference however the hand and the correct one of a soul 

00:00:38.550 --> 00:00:41.850
 if you learn that it's a days 

00:00:41.850 --> 00:00:44.850
 and that companies do not always mean security 

00:00:46.900 --> 00:00:50.120
 to start by preventing losses are contracts 

00:00:50.120 --> 00:00:53.120
 and gifts are not account holders 

00:00:54.470 --> 00:00:58.950
 he begins to accept his defeats with his head held high and his eyes ahead 

00:00:59.630 --> 00:01:01.520
 with the grace of an adult 

00:01:01.520 --> 00:01:04.520
 and not with the sadness of a child 

00:01:05.690 --> 00:01:08.940
 and learn to build all your roads streets 

00:01:08.940 --> 00:01:12.220
 because the terrain of tomorrow is too certain for the plans 

00:01:13.100 --> 00:01:16.100
 five turks 

00:01:18.880 --> 00:01:23.040
 after a while you learn that the hot sun is exposed for a long time 

00:01:24.970 --> 00:01:28.140
 and learn that no matter how much you care 

00:01:28.140 --> 00:01:31.140
 some people just do not care 

00:01:33.640 --> 00:01:36.640
 and accept that it does not matter how good a person is 

00:01:37.210 --> 00:01:39.790
 She preferred 35 years Ana 

00:01:39.790 --> 00:01:42.790
 the only one we need to forgive others 

00:01:44.200 --> 00:01:47.200
 I learned to speak because he had been denounced more 

00:01:48.780 --> 00:01:51.780
 discover yourself will take to build trust 

00:01:52.280 --> 00:01:55.030
 in just seconds to destroy it 

00:01:55.030 --> 00:01:59.760
 and that you can do things in an instant from which you will repent for the 

00:01:59.760 --> 00:02:02.760
 rest of life 

00:02:02.760 --> 00:02:05.090
 learn that true friendships 

00:02:05.090 --> 00:02:08.090
 continues to grow even over long distances 

00:02:09.659 --> 00:02:12.819
 but he is not what you have in life 

00:02:12.819 --> 00:02:15.819
 but who do you have in life? 

00:02:16.539 --> 00:02:20.599
 and that good friends are the family that allowed us to know 

00:02:22.659 --> 00:02:26.829
 I learned that we do not have to change friends if we understand that friends 

00:02:26.829 --> 00:02:28.709
 very 

00:02:28.709 --> 00:02:30.979
 He realizes that your best friend is you. 

00:02:30.979 --> 00:02:33.059
 can do anything 

00:02:33.059 --> 00:02:34.379
 with a big theft 

00:02:34.379 --> 00:02:37.379
 hetherington the moments together 

00:02:38.309 --> 00:02:41.769
 I've found that the people you care about most in life 

00:02:41.769 --> 00:02:44.389
 They are taken from you very quickly. 

00:02:44.389 --> 00:02:48.689
 so we should always leave the people we love with loving words 

00:02:48.689 --> 00:02:51.689
 may be the last time Mexicans 

00:02:53.949 --> 00:02:58.139
 I learned that the circumstances of the environments influence us 

00:02:58.939 --> 00:03:01.939
 but we are responsible for ourselves 

00:03:03.599 --> 00:03:06.969
 I would not be surprised that one should not compare with others 

00:03:06.969 --> 00:03:09.969
 but with the best time ever 

00:03:10.789 --> 00:03:14.609
 I discovered that it takes a long time to become a person 

00:03:15.249 --> 00:03:17.779
 this time is short 

00:03:17.779 --> 00:03:21.159
 learn that it does not matter where it's come from 

00:03:21.159 --> 00:03:22.899
 but where are you going? 

00:03:22.899 --> 00:03:25.999
 but if you do not know where any democracy is going 

00:03:29.219 --> 00:03:30.699
 I learned that 

00:03:30.699 --> 00:03:34.019
 o you control your acts or they build you organ 

00:03:34.959 --> 00:03:38.619
 and that if it was possible does not mean to be weak having no personality 

00:03:39.749 --> 00:03:43.619
 after the encounter with a delicate and French of a situation 

00:03:43.619 --> 00:03:46.619
 there are always two sides 

00:03:47.529 --> 00:03:51.569
 I learned that we are people who did what was necessary to do 

00:03:51.569 --> 00:03:54.569
 facing the consequences 

00:03:55.489 --> 00:03:58.489
 I learned that patience requires a lot of practice 

00:04:00.589 --> 00:04:05.109
 I have discovered that sometimes the person you expect to kick and when you 

00:04:05.109 --> 00:04:05.800
 falls 

00:04:05.800 --> 00:04:09.480
 is one of the few who helped him raise five goals 

00:04:10.379 --> 00:04:14.840
 does not learn that maturity has more to do with the kind of experience 

00:04:14.840 --> 00:04:15.590
 had 

00:04:15.590 --> 00:04:18.219
 Why did you learn from them? 

00:04:18.219 --> 00:04:21.219
 How many birthdays does our brain have? 

00:04:22.449 --> 00:04:25.629
 I learned that more than jobs without a public tender 

00:04:28.240 --> 00:04:30.979
 I learned that you should never tell a child 

00:04:30.979 --> 00:04:33.099
 What dreams are silly? 

00:04:33.099 --> 00:04:37.550
 few things are so brilliant and it would be a tragedy if she believed 

00:04:37.550 --> 00:04:40.150
 in that 

00:04:40.150 --> 00:04:42.509
 I learned that when you're angry 

00:04:42.509 --> 00:04:44.749
 have the right to be angry 

00:04:44.749 --> 00:04:47.749
 but that does not change you the right to move 

00:04:48.729 --> 00:04:50.229
 not 

00:04:50.229 --> 00:04:53.809
 I discovered that just because someone very nice you mean 

00:04:54.379 --> 00:04:57.379
 does not mean that they are who a combination of factors 

00:04:58.210 --> 00:05:00.439
 because there are people who do not swear 

00:05:00.439 --> 00:05:03.439
 but simply do not know how to demonstrate 

00:05:04.559 --> 00:05:06.409
 O 

00:05:06.409 --> 00:05:10.409
 4 at first always enough to be forgiven by someone 

00:05:10.969 --> 00:05:14.550
 sometimes you have to learn to forgive yourself 

00:05:16.539 --> 00:05:19.719
 I learned with the same severity as you judge 

00:05:19.719 --> 00:05:22.719
 Are you imagining a meeting with Bernardo? 

00:05:23.439 --> 00:05:26.979
 at first I care in how many pieces your heart was broken 

00:05:27.580 --> 00:05:33.849
 the German so that we can close I learned that time is not something that 

00:05:33.849 --> 00:05:35.719
 Come back home. 

00:05:35.719 --> 00:05:42.510
 I am not undisciplined with this the wing more to the left than the benfica 

00:05:42.510 --> 00:05:43.759
 flowers 

00:05:43.759 --> 00:05:45.620
 c pedrossian 

00:05:45.620 --> 00:05:47.979
 but can hardly bear 

00:05:47.979 --> 00:05:50.210
 the actress who also had strong 

00:05:50.210 --> 00:05:52.220
 and that can go much further 

00:05:52.220 --> 00:05:53.300
 after thinking 

00:05:53.300 --> 00:05:55.150
 What can not be more 

00:05:55.150 --> 00:05:58.150
 and that life really has values 

00:05:58.919 --> 00:06:02.029
 and has value in the face of life 

00:06:02.029 --> 00:06:04.350
 I can not sit with my arms crossed 

00:06:04.350 --> 00:06:09.790
 and we lose the good that we could conquer if it is not your means of 

00:06:09.790 --> 00:06:11.580
 field 

00:06:11.580 --> 00:06:14.580
