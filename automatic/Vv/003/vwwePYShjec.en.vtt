 do not be fooled some people today 

00:00:03.719 --> 00:00:08.630
 the illusion that the lives of 

00:00:05.940 --> 00:00:12.390
 others are perfect 

00:00:08.630 --> 00:00:14.820
 simply because you believe in the photos and 

00:00:12.390 --> 00:00:17.460
 internet and network publications 

00:00:14.820 --> 00:00:18.689
 social networks are always smiling and 

00:00:17.460 --> 00:00:22.019
 perfect 

00:00:18.689 --> 00:00:25.769
 No one will share your 

00:00:22.019 --> 00:00:27.929
 suffering or their injuries to their 

00:00:25.769 --> 00:00:30.419
 adversities even because 

00:00:27.929 --> 00:00:32.850
 modifies the life of anyone we want 

00:00:30.419 --> 00:00:34.829

00:00:32.850 --> 00:00:36.570
 some people watch my life and 

00:00:34.829 --> 00:00:38.329
 believe me I do not suffer 

00:00:36.570 --> 00:00:42.989

00:00:38.329 --> 00:00:46.440
 suffering more tribulations 

00:00:42.989 --> 00:00:50.489
 I may have more persecutions but in 

00:00:46.440 --> 00:00:55.280
 July the bad performances that you 

00:00:50.489 --> 00:00:58.589
 But why do you always see me smiling? 

00:00:55.280 --> 00:01:01.170
 because since I decided to obey the 

00:00:58.589 --> 00:01:03.210
 God, all my days. 

00:01:01.170 --> 00:01:06.390
 thanking him because he is 

00:01:03.210 --> 00:01:08.790
 regardless of what he does 

00:01:06.390 --> 00:01:12.720
 my life has been sustained by a 

00:01:08.790 --> 00:01:15.120
 sentiment called gratitude to the 

00:01:12.720 --> 00:01:18.540
 praise are sustained by a heart 

00:01:15.120 --> 00:01:21.060
 grateful that it does not depend on circumstances 

00:01:18.540 --> 00:01:22.980
 this is a lifestyle and depends on 

00:01:21.060 --> 00:01:24.980
 a personal decision by you 

00:01:22.980 --> 00:01:28.020
 my afflictions have greatly diminished 

00:01:24.980 --> 00:01:32.130
 since I decided to obey God 

00:01:28.020 --> 00:01:36.480
 because the faithful Christian enjoys a 

00:01:32.130 --> 00:01:38.370
 peace that is in Christ rejoicing in 

00:01:36.480 --> 00:01:41.070
 through trials 

00:01:38.370 --> 00:01:45.240
 so joÃ£o days in the first letter 

00:01:41.070 --> 00:01:48.740
 John chapter 5 verse 4 that the 

00:01:45.240 --> 00:01:51.900
 victory that comes if the world is our faith 

00:01:48.740 --> 00:01:54.030
 the faith in Christ that has risen for us 

00:01:51.900 --> 00:01:55.150
 to give salvation and sent us the spirit 

00:01:54.030 --> 00:01:58.360
 holy that I used 

00:01:55.150 --> 00:02:03.750
 in fact and it is with him that we speak 

00:01:58.360 --> 00:02:03.750
 Right now, I can swear to you. 

00:02:18.730 --> 00:02:25.550
 and I now present to you the life of each 

00:02:23.989 --> 00:02:30.590

 and consecration puts the hand in the heart 

00:02:37.040 --> 00:02:40.330
 just like I do at the moment 

00:02:40.710 --> 00:02:48.070

00:02:43.900 --> 00:02:50.530

00:02:48.070 --> 00:02:51.940
 feeling that now dwells in our 

00:02:50.530 --> 00:02:53.890
 hearts 

00:02:51.940 --> 00:02:55.530
 especially those who have made 

00:02:53.890 --> 00:02:59.770

 tribulations we have been through 

00:03:04.590 --> 00:03:10.840

00:03:07.930 --> 00:03:14.260

00:03:10.840 --> 00:03:16.450

00:03:14.260 --> 00:03:19.300
 each of the feelings that 

00:03:16.450 --> 00:03:22.650
 At the moment we do not understand that in your 

00:03:19.300 --> 00:03:26.920
 word we can find answers 

00:03:22.650 --> 00:03:30.340
 and especially the peace that goes beyond 

00:03:26.920 --> 00:03:32.650

 only when we're happy but 

00:03:44.860 --> 00:03:48.730
 also when we go through moments of 

00:03:47.170 --> 00:03:52.540
 difficulty 

00:03:48.730 --> 00:03:56.760
 when we are hurt when we are 

00:03:52.540 --> 00:03:59.890
 deceived when we are confused 

00:03:56.760 --> 00:04:02.740

 comes to an end without us being able to 

00:04:07.420 --> 00:04:14.879
