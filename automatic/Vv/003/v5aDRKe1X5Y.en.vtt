00:00:06.860 --> 00:00:09.370
 do not 

00:00:22.320 --> 00:00:25.130
 best 

00:00:43.290 --> 00:00:45.380
 i 

00:02:35.190 --> 00:02:39.500
 today 

00:02:36.720 --> 00:02:39.500
 no no 

00:03:45.040 --> 00:03:50.560
 we are here with methods and methods 

00:03:48.430 --> 00:03:53.260
 tell us a bit because you think that 

00:03:50.560 --> 00:03:54.640
 the group phase has not been so hard 

00:03:53.260 --> 00:03:56.379
 so to speak because you consider that 

00:03:54.640 --> 00:03:59.319
 we have stayed behind in the tournament so 

00:03:56.379 --> 00:04:01.239
 quickly give us your good 

00:03:59.319 --> 00:04:03.010
 Well, my opinion about why 

00:04:01.239 --> 00:04:05.890
 we have had this are these bad 

00:04:03.010 --> 00:04:07.359
 results has not been good to start 

00:04:05.890 --> 00:04:10.510
 we have a very difficult group like 

00:04:07.359 --> 00:04:11.889
 let's say two fat Americans was the 

00:04:10.510 --> 00:04:15.159
 only group that had two teams 

00:04:11.889 --> 00:04:17.320
 Americans and the truth is that there 

00:04:15.159 --> 00:04:20.019
 ease you can not train in gaming 

00:04:17.320 --> 00:04:22.389
 house would be taken as it is like a job 

00:04:20.019 --> 00:04:24.520
 since it is charged monthly and such and 

00:04:22.389 --> 00:04:27.789
 can take much more serious is that the 

00:04:24.520 --> 00:04:29.830
 level of the us in europe it is a bit 

00:04:27.789 --> 00:04:32.349
 one step higher than ours and it 

00:04:29.830 --> 00:04:34.479
 has also noticed and also the team the 

00:04:32.349 --> 00:04:36.360
 European team to educate your set 

00:04:34.479 --> 00:04:40.090
 it also made it very difficult but good 

00:04:36.360 --> 00:04:42.370
 we had already been eliminated 

00:04:40.090 --> 00:04:43.870
 and we did not care but we did not play 

00:04:42.370 --> 00:04:47.050
 really on chair the last game of 

00:04:43.870 --> 00:04:50.229
 groups and now we have done a few bad 

00:04:47.050 --> 00:04:51.970
 results but good to follow a month 

00:04:50.229 --> 00:04:53.680
 whole now that you're here tell us 

00:04:51.970 --> 00:04:56.889
 I wanted to be the first one to fall asleep in 

00:04:53.680 --> 00:04:58.990
 the hotel, we try nothing like that 

00:04:56.889 --> 00:05:01.000
 make jokes or something to the first one who 

00:04:58.990 --> 00:05:03.280
 sleep and we do pranks for 

00:05:01.000 --> 00:05:06.669
 example we have to do they have mouth 

00:05:03.280 --> 00:05:09.520
 or something like that and nothing because we had it 

00:05:06.669 --> 00:05:12.840
 well at the hotel always doing things 

00:05:09.520 --> 00:05:12.840
 We rarely invent things and other things 

00:05:13.249 --> 00:05:18.049
 what are you going to read what do you think 

00:05:15.169 --> 00:05:20.299
 He pointed to the other as it was has 

00:05:18.049 --> 00:05:22.129
 appeared calmer 

00:05:20.299 --> 00:05:23.899
 having fewer people will not happen 

00:05:22.129 --> 00:05:25.339
 that seems to me more calm 

00:05:23.899 --> 00:05:27.139
 less exciting because now to see a 

00:05:25.339 --> 00:05:29.119
 so it's like there's a lot more 

00:05:27.139 --> 00:05:30.499
 people and you can not see it so quiet 

00:05:29.119 --> 00:05:32.929
 before I could sit there's an armchair and 

00:05:30.499 --> 00:05:34.950
 berman party quietly this is a 

00:05:32.929 --> 00:05:37.650
 most central site 

00:05:34.950 --> 00:05:39.000
 as a place I like more this but with 

00:05:37.650 --> 00:05:41.460
 Measurement of the sky the other by the theme 

00:05:39.000 --> 00:05:43.100
 that it was calmer and there was no 

00:05:41.460 --> 00:05:44.900
 so many people 

00:05:43.100 --> 00:05:46.550
 man who might tony since you are here 

00:05:44.900 --> 00:05:49.210
 tell us a bit about why you stay 

00:05:46.550 --> 00:05:49.210
 as always player 

00:05:50.300 --> 00:05:55.190
 this is a somewhat complicated answer 

00:05:52.370 --> 00:05:57.110
 but basically my main motive is 

00:05:55.190 --> 00:05:58.790
 that I consider not having 

00:05:57.110 --> 00:06:00.650
 the following motivation and time in 

00:05:58.790 --> 00:06:03.230
 set to continue in the team since 

00:06:00.650 --> 00:06:05.360
 as captain always watched I looked 

00:06:03.230 --> 00:06:07.730
 for the sake of the group in general the 

00:06:05.360 --> 00:06:09.710
 group that advances that always always 

00:06:07.730 --> 00:06:11.150
 meet the objectives that are quite 

00:06:09.710 --> 00:06:13.610
 highs we never usually follow alone to 

00:06:11.150 --> 00:06:15.890
 national level and I believe that in 

00:06:13.610 --> 00:06:17.990
 this moment I delay the evolution of 

00:06:15.890 --> 00:06:19.250
 this team so to speak so 

00:06:17.990 --> 00:06:22.300
 I prefer to move away and give the opportunity 

00:06:19.250 --> 00:06:24.729
 another person who surely contributes more 

00:06:22.300 --> 00:06:27.430
 more desire and more time than I that sure 

00:06:24.729 --> 00:06:30.660
 and just step away from the team and 

00:06:27.430 --> 00:06:32.960
 help them in whatever it takes 

00:06:30.660 --> 00:06:32.960
 do not 

00:06:35.600 --> 00:06:38.380
 no no 

00:06:42.430 --> 00:06:46.639
 do not 

00:06:44.400 --> 00:06:46.639
 do not
