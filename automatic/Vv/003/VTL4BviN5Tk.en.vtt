00:00:48.270 --> 00:00:50.029 
thought it couldn't be booked in a
better<00:00:48.480> way<00:00:48.750> maybe<00:00:48.989> bicho<00:00:49.770> could<00:00:49.920> have

00:00:50.029 --> 00:00:50.039 
better way maybe bicho could have

00:00:50.039 --> 00:00:52.639 
better way maybe bicho could have
announced<00:00:50.460> it<00:00:50.550> in<00:00:50.579> the<00:00:50.789> ring<00:00:51.030> and<00:00:51.300> then<00:00:51.780> to<00:00:52.500> go

00:01:14.870 --> 00:01:14.880 
the past two weeks have really been

00:01:14.880 --> 00:01:16.850 
the past two weeks have really been
advertising<00:01:15.479> this<00:01:15.780> well<00:01:16.020> very<00:01:16.290> well<00:01:16.409> so

think<00:03:26.600> this<00:03:27.600> match<00:03:27.840> could<00:03:27.990> be<00:03:28.050> pretty<00:03:28.260> good<00:03:28.500> as

00:03:28.580 --> 00:03:28.590 
think this match could be pretty good as

00:03:28.590 --> 00:03:30.440 
think this match could be pretty good as
well<00:03:28.620> but<00:03:28.980> for<00:03:29.220> me<00:03:29.370> there's<00:03:30.030> only<00:03:30.150> two<00:03:30.420> things

00:03:30.440 --> 00:03:30.450 
well but for me there's only two things

00:03:30.450 --> 00:03:33.170 
well but for me there's only two things
cute<00:03:30.840> which<00:03:31.200> could<00:03:31.470> happen<00:03:31.700> Alberto<00:03:32.700> Del<00:03:33.000> Rio

00:03:33.170 --> 00:03:33.180 
cute which could happen Alberto Del Rio

00:03:33.180 --> 00:03:35.750 
cute which could happen Alberto Del Rio
could<00:03:33.390> even<00:03:33.570> win<00:03:33.780> I<00:03:33.990> think<00:03:34.230> for<00:03:34.560> me<00:03:34.590> and<00:03:34.950> that

00:03:35.750 --> 00:03:35.760 
could even win I think for me and that

00:03:35.760 --> 00:03:37.580 
could even win I think for me and that
would<00:03:36.180> be<00:03:36.210> the<00:03:36.390> wrong<00:03:36.540> choice<00:03:36.600> you<00:03:37.290> could<00:03:37.350> be<00:03:37.560> a

00:03:37.580 --> 00:03:37.590 
would be the wrong choice you could be a

00:03:37.590 --> 00:03:39.590 
would be the wrong choice you could be a
light<00:03:37.740> what<00:03:38.250> why<00:03:38.970> would<00:03:39.120> you<00:03:39.180> do<00:03:39.330> that<00:03:39.360> was<00:03:39.540> the

00:03:39.590 --> 00:03:39.600 
light what why would you do that was the

00:03:39.600 --> 00:03:41.240 
light what why would you do that was the
wrong<00:03:39.750> choice<00:03:39.810> truly<00:03:40.530> the<00:03:40.620> bitter<00:03:40.830> Alberto

00:03:41.240 --> 00:03:41.250 
wrong choice truly the bitter Alberto

00:03:41.250 --> 00:03:43.340 
wrong choice truly the bitter Alberto
Del<00:03:41.550> Rio<00:03:41.730> should<00:03:41.910> carry<00:03:42.180> on<00:03:42.300> his<00:03:42.390> reign<00:03:42.630> yes

00:03:43.340 --> 00:03:43.350 
Del Rio should carry on his reign yes

00:03:43.350 --> 00:03:45.380 
Del Rio should carry on his reign yes
but<00:03:43.680> here's<00:03:44.220> why<00:03:44.460> I<00:03:44.490> think<00:03:44.520> that<00:03:44.880> Big<00:03:45.180> Show

00:03:45.380 --> 00:03:45.390 
but here's why I think that Big Show

00:03:45.390 --> 00:03:47.030 
but here's why I think that Big Show
could<00:03:45.630> win<00:03:45.840> we<00:03:46.230> all<00:03:46.350> thought<00:03:46.560> that<00:03:46.620> Ziggler

00:03:47.030 --> 00:03:47.040 
could win we all thought that Ziggler

00:03:47.040 --> 00:03:48.680 
could win we all thought that Ziggler
could<00:03:47.340> possibly<00:03:47.790> have<00:03:48.030> a<00:03:48.060> chance<00:03:48.330> of<00:03:48.420> cash

00:03:48.680 --> 00:03:48.690 
could possibly have a chance of cash

00:03:48.690 --> 00:03:52.640 
could possibly have a chance of cash
again<00:03:49.020> before<00:03:49.530> the<00:03:49.920> TLC<00:03:50.310> match<00:03:51.290> so<00:03:52.290> that<00:03:52.500> they

00:03:52.640 --> 00:03:52.650 
again before the TLC match so that they

00:03:52.650 --> 00:03:55.610 
again before the TLC match so that they
will<00:03:52.980> turn<00:03:53.130> Ziggler<00:03:54.000> cash<00:03:54.240> in<00:03:54.390> a<00:03:54.450> win<00:03:54.690> episode

00:03:55.610 --> 00:03:55.620 
will turn Ziggler cash in a win episode

00:03:55.620 --> 00:03:57.740 
will turn Ziggler cash in a win episode

against John Cena and Dolph Ziggler so

00:04:24.110 --> 00:04:26.330 
against John Cena and Dolph Ziggler so
that's<00:04:25.110> why<00:04:25.320> they<00:04:25.470> gift<00:04:25.680> all<00:04:25.830> six<00:04:26.010> of<00:04:26.070> the<00:04:26.160> body

00:04:26.330 --> 00:04:26.340 
that's why they gift all six of the body

00:04:26.340 --> 00:04:27.400 
that's why they gift all six of the body
of<00:04:26.430> the<00:04:26.490> bank<00:04:26.700> they<00:04:27.060> want

00:04:27.400 --> 00:04:27.410 
of the bank they want

00:04:27.410 --> 00:04:29.740 
of the bank they want
big<00:04:27.680> emphasis<00:04:28.160> when<00:04:28.310> he<00:04:28.400> does<00:04:28.580> finally<00:04:28.850> win<00:04:29.210> so

big emphasis when he does finally win so

00:04:29.750 --> 00:04:31.030 
big emphasis when he does finally win so
we<00:04:29.870> all<00:04:29.990> thought<00:04:30.230> that<00:04:30.290> Ziggler<00:04:30.650> would<00:04:30.830> go

00:04:31.030 --> 00:04:31.040 
we all thought that Ziggler would go

00:04:31.040 --> 00:04:32.260 
we all thought that Ziggler would go
with<00:04:31.340> the<00:04:31.460> World<00:04:31.610> Heavyweight<00:04:31.790> Championship

00:04:32.260 --> 00:04:32.270 
with the World Heavyweight Championship

00:04:32.270 --> 00:04:33.640 
with the World Heavyweight Championship
but<00:04:32.660> that<00:04:32.810> didn't<00:04:33.020> happen<00:04:33.110> at<00:04:33.350> all<00:04:33.440> we<00:04:33.620> just

00:04:33.640 --> 00:04:33.650 
but that didn't happen at all we just

00:04:33.650 --> 00:04:35.290 
but that didn't happen at all we just
got<00:04:33.980> what<00:04:34.250> do<00:04:34.430> we<00:04:34.550> do<00:04:34.640> we've<00:04:34.760> kind<00:04:35.030> of<00:04:35.060> plugged

00:04:35.290 --> 00:04:35.300 
got what do we do we've kind of plugged

00:04:35.300 --> 00:04:37.960 
got what do we do we've kind of plugged
up<00:04:35.480> to<00:04:35.690> do<00:04:35.900> yeah<00:04:36.680> obviously<00:04:36.950> but<00:04:37.100> they<00:04:37.730> just

00:04:37.960 --> 00:04:37.970 
up to do yeah obviously but they just

00:04:37.970 --> 00:04:39.250 
up to do yeah obviously but they just
give<00:04:38.120> them<00:04:38.270> money<00:04:38.420> the<00:04:38.600> back<00:04:38.750> at<00:04:38.960> the<00:04:39.050> top<00:04:39.230> of

00:04:39.250 --> 00:04:39.260 
give them money the back at the top of

00:04:39.260 --> 00:04:41.020 
give them money the back at the top of
the<00:04:39.380> rigger<00:04:39.590> we<00:04:39.770> had<00:04:39.920> the<00:04:40.040> normal<00:04:40.400> match<00:04:40.610> so

00:04:41.020 --> 00:04:41.030 
the rigger we had the normal match so

00:04:41.030 --> 00:04:43.750 
the rigger we had the normal match so
the<00:04:42.020> reason<00:04:42.620> why<00:04:42.890> I<00:04:42.950> think<00:04:43.040> they've<00:04:43.310> saving<00:04:43.670> it

00:04:43.750 --> 00:04:43.760 
the reason why I think they've saving it

00:04:43.760 --> 00:04:45.940 
the reason why I think they've saving it
till<00:04:43.940> rubble<00:04:44.540> is<00:04:44.660> to<00:04:44.810> put<00:04:44.960> a<00:04:44.990> huge<00:04:45.350> emphasis<00:04:45.800> of

00:04:45.940 --> 00:04:45.950 
till rubble is to put a huge emphasis of
