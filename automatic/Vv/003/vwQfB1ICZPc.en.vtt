00:00:23.550 --> 00:00:23.560 
this is the raw on the diversion of the

00:00:23.560 --> 00:00:27.060 
this is the raw on the diversion of the
cool<00:00:23.980> max<00:00:24.520> s<00:00:24.820> alive<00:00:25.150> 500<00:00:26.140> watt<00:00:26.290> power<00:00:26.620> supplies

00:00:27.060 --> 00:00:27.070

so<00:00:27.370> if<00:00:27.460> you<00:00:27.520> like<00:00:27.700> this<00:00:27.880> maybe<00:00:28.390> I'll<00:00:28.570> do<00:00:28.750> more

00:00:28.980 --> 00:00:28.990 
so if you like this maybe I'll do more

00:00:28.990 --> 00:00:31.620 
so if you like this maybe I'll do more
like<00:00:29.260> this<00:00:29.470> kind<00:00:30.040> of<00:00:30.130> a<00:00:30.220> new<00:00:30.550> concept<00:00:31.270> because

00:00:31.620 --> 00:00:31.630 
like this kind of a new concept because

00:00:31.630 --> 00:00:33.630 
like this kind of a new concept because
sometimes<00:00:32.080> people<00:00:32.200> complain<00:00:32.800> about<00:00:32.830> how

00:00:33.630 --> 00:00:33.640 
sometimes people complain about how

00:00:33.640 --> 00:00:35.970 
sometimes people complain about how
boring<00:00:34.240> the<00:00:34.450> memory<00:00:35.110> and<00:00:35.410> power<00:00:35.680> supply

00:00:35.970 --> 00:00:35.980 
boring the memory and power supply

00:00:35.980 --> 00:00:38.280 
boring the memory and power supply
reviews<00:00:36.610> are<00:00:36.850> well<00:00:37.150> let<00:00:37.570> me<00:00:37.690> take<00:00:37.840> this<00:00:38.020> camera

00:00:38.280 --> 00:00:38.290 
reviews are well let me take this camera

00:00:38.290 --> 00:00:40.350 
reviews are well let me take this camera
they<00:00:38.620> swing<00:00:38.890> around<00:00:39.010> a<00:00:39.340> little<00:00:39.460> bit<00:00:39.670> and<00:00:39.910> maybe

00:00:40.350 --> 00:00:40.360 
they swing around a little bit and maybe

00:00:40.360 --> 00:00:43.760 
they swing around a little bit and maybe
it<00:00:40.750> will<00:00:40.960> be<00:00:40.989> a<00:00:41.320> little<00:00:41.890> bit<00:00:42.160> more<00:00:42.730> exciting

00:00:43.760 --> 00:00:43.770 
it will be a little bit more exciting

00:00:43.770 --> 00:00:46.470 
it will be a little bit more exciting
okay<00:00:44.770> here<00:00:44.950> we<00:00:44.980> are<00:00:45.100> now<00:00:45.370> to<00:00:45.430> video<00:00:45.940> review

00:00:46.470 --> 00:00:46.480 
okay here we are now to video review

00:00:46.480 --> 00:00:48.210 
okay here we are now to video review
wrong<00:00:46.750> we're<00:00:46.989> actually<00:00:47.080> moving<00:00:47.410> so<00:00:47.770> this<00:00:47.980> is

00:00:48.210 --> 00:00:48.220 
wrong we're actually moving so this is

00:00:48.220 --> 00:00:50.610 
wrong we're actually moving so this is
soon<00:00:48.640> not<00:00:48.970> going<00:00:49.210> to<00:00:49.330> be<00:00:49.510> my<00:00:49.750> role<00:00:49.989> at<00:00:50.140> all<00:00:50.290> what

00:00:50.610 --> 00:00:50.620 
soon not going to be my role at all what

00:00:50.620 --> 00:00:52.500 
soon not going to be my role at all what
you're<00:00:50.739> seeing<00:00:50.860> behind<00:00:51.040> me<00:00:51.400> is<00:00:51.580> boxes<00:00:52.390> again

00:00:52.500 --> 00:00:52.510 
you're seeing behind me is boxes again

00:00:52.510 --> 00:00:55.200 
you're seeing behind me is boxes again
remember<00:00:53.200> nothing<00:00:53.920> in<00:00:54.100> this<00:00:54.220> video<00:00:54.550> review<00:00:54.760> is

00:00:55.200 --> 00:00:55.210 
remember nothing in this video review is

00:00:55.210 --> 00:00:58.140 
remember nothing in this video review is
edited<00:00:56.170> going<00:00:56.650> to<00:00:56.740> give<00:00:56.920> you<00:00:57.040> the<00:00:57.070> raw<00:00:57.430> version

00:00:58.140 --> 00:00:58.150 
edited going to give you the raw version

00:00:58.150 --> 00:01:01.590 
edited going to give you the raw version
of<00:00:58.540> this<00:00:59.110> power<00:00:59.620> supply<00:01:00.100> video<00:01:00.820> review<00:01:01.239> okay

00:01:01.590 --> 00:01:01.600 
of this power supply video review okay

00:01:01.600 --> 00:01:03.750 
of this power supply video review okay
so<00:01:01.660> let's<00:01:01.930> have<00:01:02.050> a<00:01:02.110> look<00:01:02.170> now<00:01:02.500> at<00:01:02.739> the<00:01:03.489> power

00:01:03.750 --> 00:01:03.760 
so let's have a look now at the power

00:01:03.760 --> 00:01:07.320 
so let's have a look now at the power
supply<00:01:05.160> this<00:01:06.160> particular<00:01:06.430> product<00:01:07.030> has<00:01:07.300> a

00:01:07.320 --> 00:01:07.330 
supply this particular product has a

00:01:07.330 --> 00:01:10.620 
supply this particular product has a
continuous<00:01:08.259> wattage<00:01:08.649> of<00:01:09.360> 500<00:01:10.360> can<00:01:10.540> you

00:01:10.620 --> 00:01:10.630 
continuous wattage of 500 can you

00:01:10.630 --> 00:01:13.050 
continuous wattage of 500 can you
believe<00:01:10.930> that<00:01:10.960> which<00:01:11.680> is<00:01:11.710> ample<00:01:12.369> power<00:01:12.580> for

00:01:13.050 --> 00:01:13.060 
believe that which is ample power for

00:01:13.060 --> 00:01:15.570 
believe that which is ample power for
today's<00:01:13.420> computer<00:01:14.140> systems<00:01:14.590> now<00:01:14.979> how<00:01:15.280> in<00:01:15.490> the

00:01:15.570 --> 00:01:15.580 
today's computer systems now how in the

00:01:15.580 --> 00:01:18.270 
today's computer systems now how in the
heck<00:01:15.850> is<00:01:15.880> this<00:01:16.210> what<00:01:16.270> is<00:01:16.630> determined<00:01:16.860> well<00:01:17.860> to

00:01:18.270 --> 00:01:18.280 
heck is this what is determined well to

00:01:18.280 --> 00:01:20.730 
heck is this what is determined well to
understand<00:01:19.180> that<00:01:19.509> you<00:01:19.930> need<00:01:20.170> to<00:01:20.350> know<00:01:20.500> what

00:01:20.730 --> 00:01:20.740 
understand that you need to know what

00:01:20.740 --> 00:01:23.280 
understand that you need to know what
