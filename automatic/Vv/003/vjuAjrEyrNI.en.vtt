00:00:07.420 --> 00:00:10.109
 i 

00:00:10.490 --> 00:00:16.010
 hello very good 7 jairo vi and today we are 

00:00:13.760 --> 00:00:17.960
 in a new video of gta una 

00:00:16.010 --> 00:00:19.669
 modification in this case we are not going to 

00:00:17.960 --> 00:00:21.919
 call a lot because it's not a mod like 

00:00:19.669 --> 00:00:24.860
 such but they are textures as you see 

00:00:21.919 --> 00:00:27.080
 in the textures title in 4k and is that 

00:00:24.860 --> 00:00:29.420
 yesterday an update of the open 4 came out 

00:00:27.080 --> 00:00:31.580
 what is the program this with which 

00:00:29.420 --> 00:00:34.160
 you know that we can change things to 

00:00:31.580 --> 00:00:37.309
 game we can change a lot of things 

00:00:34.160 --> 00:00:38.870
 as well as the garden that is the mode of 

00:00:37.309 --> 00:00:40.250
 drive from the vehicles you know 

00:00:38.870 --> 00:00:42.979
 we can change all these things 

00:00:40.250 --> 00:00:44.870
 thanks to what in four well 

00:00:42.979 --> 00:00:47.360
 so as not to roll up, it's basically gone 

00:00:44.870 --> 00:00:50.150
 an update and you can start 

00:00:47.360 --> 00:00:51.559
 to change textures and therefore the first one 

00:00:50.150 --> 00:00:54.680
 I have one of those that I have put on 

00:00:51.559 --> 00:00:56.479
 is the water in 4k, there are many more 

00:00:54.680 --> 00:01:00.110
 he told us that there are many more 

00:00:56.479 --> 00:01:02.119
 the water in 4k the blood in 4k the moon in 

00:01:00.110 --> 00:01:04.640
 4k is none in two every time 

00:01:02.119 --> 00:01:06.500
 sorry and as I tell you this what it does 

00:01:04.640 --> 00:01:08.330
 is to change the textures so that you 

00:01:06.500 --> 00:01:09.860
 make an idea in the textures of 

00:01:08.330 --> 00:01:11.400
 I play most of the textures of 

00:01:09.860 --> 00:01:16.170
 game are 

00:01:11.400 --> 00:01:19.380
 to 512 by 512 and if not as maximum as 

00:01:16.170 --> 00:01:21.660
 maximum are at 1024 x 1024 

00:01:19.380 --> 00:01:23.160
 those are the textures have the game and 

00:01:21.660 --> 00:01:24.960
 and people are starting to 

00:01:23.160 --> 00:01:26.970
 modify to make them better 

00:01:24.960 --> 00:01:29.640
 here in the video I do not know if you will finish 

00:01:26.970 --> 00:01:31.410
 notice the water but I will leave you the 

00:01:29.640 --> 00:01:33.750
 links of all these that I tell you of the 

00:01:31.410 --> 00:01:36.090
 blood water I'll leave the links 

00:01:33.750 --> 00:01:38.550
 of all so that you can yourselves 

00:01:36.090 --> 00:01:40.890
 see the difference because in the links 

00:01:38.550 --> 00:01:42.660
 in the download of the mod are the photos 

00:01:40.890 --> 00:01:44.640
 with the difference and yes there is noticeable 

00:01:42.660 --> 00:01:46.740
 I already much you water the 

00:01:44.640 --> 00:01:48.390
 Maybe it's the new far better than 

00:01:46.740 --> 00:01:51.270
 that you see normally if you do not have 

00:01:48.390 --> 00:01:55.290
 of course this way since I tell you that the 

00:01:51.270 --> 00:01:56.880
 normal water would be at 1024 x 1024 if 

00:01:55.290 --> 00:01:59.250
 look at the picture of the water you are going to flip 

00:01:56.880 --> 00:02:01.790
 why are you going to say Thursday the difference 

00:01:59.250 --> 00:02:03.780
 of water resolution then 

00:02:01.790 --> 00:02:05.640
 basically that is now thanks to this 

00:02:03.780 --> 00:02:08.399
 to this new update of order 4 

00:02:05.640 --> 00:02:09.780
 we can put new textures in the 

00:02:08.399 --> 00:02:11.730
 game start changing the textures 

00:02:09.780 --> 00:02:14.760
 I have also put one that changes you 

00:02:11.730 --> 00:02:17.069
 a little bit the road and it changes you a bit 

00:02:14.760 --> 00:02:18.959
 zones some soils but I have not been 

00:02:17.069 --> 00:02:21.120
 able to find where those are 

00:02:18.959 --> 00:02:23.400
 changes I am not able to reach the site 

00:02:21.120 --> 00:02:25.500
 where are these changes and not not 

00:02:23.400 --> 00:02:27.000
 I can teach but since I commented already 

00:02:25.500 --> 00:02:29.879
 little by little they are starting to come out 

00:02:27.000 --> 00:02:31.620
 beautiful things then for example the one that 

00:02:29.879 --> 00:02:33.269
 change the earth and the one that changes some 

00:02:31.620 --> 00:02:35.250
 parts of the soil terrain as I have 

00:02:33.269 --> 00:02:37.379
 commented this guy what he wants to do 

00:02:35.250 --> 00:02:39.299
 is to go adding little by little to change 

00:02:37.379 --> 00:02:40.829
 more things this is the beginning and little to 

00:02:39.299 --> 00:02:43.709
 little go adding more things so that 

00:02:40.829 --> 00:02:45.510
 the whole game in general looks better on 

00:02:43.709 --> 00:02:48.000
 problem what is the problem they will have 

00:02:45.510 --> 00:02:51.530
 to solve it then right now 

00:02:48.000 --> 00:02:51.530
 we started to put many files 

00:02:51.790 --> 00:02:59.360
 in 64 a is worth because I tell you good 

00:02:56.420 --> 00:03:01.220
 that to put for example this of this 

00:02:59.360 --> 00:03:03.950
 of the earth is all in the blood and 

00:03:01.220 --> 00:03:05.420
 things like that you have to put them in 64 a 

00:03:03.950 --> 00:03:08.420
 that is called like that the file of the 

00:03:05.420 --> 00:03:11.599
 games then nothing the thing is in that 

00:03:08.420 --> 00:03:14.390
 you can see that the game itself detects how much 

00:03:11.599 --> 00:03:16.640
 occupies that file and if that and if that 

00:03:14.390 --> 00:03:18.890
 file takes up a lot more than what 

00:03:16.640 --> 00:03:21.049
 would have to really occupy then you 

00:03:18.890 --> 00:03:23.269
 he said it was a mistake he basically gives you a 

00:03:21.049 --> 00:03:25.849
 error and you can not open the game have 

00:03:23.269 --> 00:03:28.519
 error then for the moment as I say 

00:03:25.849 --> 00:03:30.200
 I could only put with him these 

00:03:28.519 --> 00:03:32.420
 two because if I started to put more 

00:03:30.200 --> 00:03:35.120
 it gave error even supposed only that of the 

00:03:32.420 --> 00:03:36.920
 blood gave me error but good little 

00:03:35.120 --> 00:03:38.810
 little by little this was solving and achieving 

00:03:36.920 --> 00:03:41.120
 arranging as I tell you the thing is in 

00:03:38.810 --> 00:03:42.950
 what the game is supposed to check 

00:03:41.120 --> 00:03:45.319
 how much they occupy files and the file 

00:03:42.950 --> 00:03:47.450
 takes much more than the account you know 

00:03:45.319 --> 00:03:48.890
 that is modified or takes less care of 

00:03:47.450 --> 00:03:50.590
 the account you already know that that file is 

00:03:48.890 --> 00:03:52.930
 modified and 

00:03:50.590 --> 00:03:55.180
 it gives you an error this is from nothing 

00:03:52.930 --> 00:03:56.019
 tell me that as I say those who like you 

00:03:55.180 --> 00:03:57.280
 I always say 

00:03:56.019 --> 00:03:58.870
 to download it you have one 

00:03:57.280 --> 00:04:01.269
 description and also you can go to look 

00:03:58.870 --> 00:04:04.209
 there the comparison from the changes that 

00:04:01.269 --> 00:04:05.560
 make and comment that to be able 

00:04:04.209 --> 00:04:07.360
 use them you have to disconnect in 

00:04:05.560 --> 00:04:09.819
 internet is ok because if you enter the game 

00:04:07.360 --> 00:04:11.319
 automatically connected the game is 

00:04:09.819 --> 00:04:13.720
 update and put the files 

00:04:11.319 --> 00:04:15.160
 originals then basically this is 

00:04:13.720 --> 00:04:17.350
 this video is that you may know already 

00:04:15.160 --> 00:04:18.459
 they begin to see textures and good little to 

00:04:17.350 --> 00:04:21.180
 little when things start to come out 

00:04:18.459 --> 00:04:24.520
 beautiful things that really change here 

00:04:21.180 --> 00:04:26.560
 things beasts and look handsome then go 

00:04:24.520 --> 00:04:28.479
 making videos and teaching these 

00:04:26.560 --> 00:04:29.919
 changes our new textures the 

00:04:28.479 --> 00:04:32.650
 moment as I tell you we have that we have 

00:04:29.919 --> 00:04:34.750
 the water we have the blood we have some 

00:04:32.650 --> 00:04:37.180
 little road and some area of the ground I think 

00:04:34.750 --> 00:04:38.680
 that as I have been able to find and 

00:04:37.180 --> 00:04:41.380
 good little by little because as you 

00:04:38.680 --> 00:04:43.120
 I comment the update of the 24 for 

00:04:41.380 --> 00:04:45.820
 to be able to do this from the change of textures 

00:04:43.120 --> 00:04:47.440
 it came out yesterday so since a month 

00:04:45.820 --> 00:04:49.270
 imagine everything we can have 

00:04:47.440 --> 00:04:50.770
 I hope you liked this video and 

00:04:49.270 --> 00:04:54.810
