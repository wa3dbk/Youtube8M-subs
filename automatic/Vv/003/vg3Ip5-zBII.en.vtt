00:00:52.410 --> 00:00:55.900
 adapted you are welcome once 

00:00:54.550 --> 00:00:59.470
 more to a flight school and we're 

00:00:55.900 --> 00:01:01.750
 talking about the poachers the worst trash 

00:00:59.470 --> 00:01:04.540
 that has been done in heaven since it was 

00:01:01.750 --> 00:01:05.650
 he invented the baron field franchise but 

00:01:04.540 --> 00:01:07.840
 How I promised you to do both 

00:01:05.650 --> 00:01:09.670
 Well, I'll explain how they fly 

00:01:07.840 --> 00:01:11.740
 number one as you can see we have 

00:01:09.670 --> 00:01:14.020
 missiles of various configurations of 

00:01:11.740 --> 00:01:15.820
 attack this furtive jet is designed 

00:01:14.020 --> 00:01:17.380
 to bring down the things that are in the 

00:01:15.820 --> 00:01:19.150
 sky and nothing that is on the floor though 

00:01:17.380 --> 00:01:20.980
 You can also shoot things from the 

00:01:19.150 --> 00:01:21.850
 that are on the floor but they are not going to 

00:01:20.980 --> 00:01:23.830
 work very well 

00:01:21.850 --> 00:01:25.540
 Elliot furtive move the big 

00:01:23.830 --> 00:01:27.250
 benefits it has is that it is very very 

00:01:25.540 --> 00:01:30.090
 fast so you can move quickly 

00:01:27.250 --> 00:01:32.770
 by the map but change the speed by 

00:01:30.090 --> 00:01:34.270
 maneuverability then it's a jet that 

00:01:32.770 --> 00:01:37.690
 It is difficult to bend and it is difficult to 

00:01:34.270 --> 00:01:39.220
 spin and usually loses in those 

00:01:37.690 --> 00:01:40.330
 strong turns against attack jets 

00:01:39.220 --> 00:01:43.990
 which are what we used to have in 

00:01:40.330 --> 00:01:46.900
 banfield 3 only in battles of 

00:01:43.990 --> 00:01:50.950
 assault the furtive jet just like the jet 

00:01:46.900 --> 00:01:53.500
 of attack have the perfect turn or more 

00:01:50.950 --> 00:01:55.720
 well in the optimal turn at the speed of 

00:01:53.500 --> 00:01:57.100
 300 kilometers or miles per hour not 

00:01:55.720 --> 00:01:58.630
 I'm sure when then I suppose 10 

00:01:57.100 --> 00:01:59.530
 kilometers per hour and you see the 

00:01:58.630 --> 00:02:01.869
 speedometer 

00:01:59.530 --> 00:02:03.549
 in that little marker on the left 

00:02:01.869 --> 00:02:05.470
 of your screen when as you can see 

00:02:03.549 --> 00:02:07.900
 here it means that every time 

00:02:05.470 --> 00:02:09.970
 they want to make a turn between 300 and 315 

00:02:07.900 --> 00:02:11.950
 kilometers per hour is the perfect turn 

00:02:09.970 --> 00:02:14.050
 the first mistake that I see all the 

00:02:11.950 --> 00:02:16.660
 novices is to try to evade the 

00:02:14.050 --> 00:02:18.520
 opposing pilots end of faith and 

00:02:16.660 --> 00:02:19.840
 faith from the English code or the 

00:02:18.520 --> 00:02:21.610
 way in English as it is said when two 

00:02:19.840 --> 00:02:23.739
 aircraft are in battle in the 

00:02:21.610 --> 00:02:25.360
 sky and they try to lower the 

00:02:23.739 --> 00:02:27.310
 speed that makes the plane start 

00:02:25.360 --> 00:02:28.900
 to stay a little stuck and then 

00:02:27.310 --> 00:02:30.810
 someone who makes it a little better 

00:02:28.900 --> 00:02:33.580
 is going to impose itself immediately on your tail 

00:02:30.810 --> 00:02:35.680
 everything that is to fly and above all 

00:02:33.580 --> 00:02:37.120
 keep alive has two functions 

00:02:35.680 --> 00:02:38.920
 specific and here I am going to give you two 

00:02:37.120 --> 00:02:41.530
 tips tip number one is to stay 

00:02:38.920 --> 00:02:42.820
 Away from enemy anti-aircraft 

00:02:41.530 --> 00:02:44.709
 the enemy anti-aircraft can be some 

00:02:42.820 --> 00:02:46.780
 antiaircraft vehicle or it can be the 

00:02:44.709 --> 00:02:48.280
 enemy aircraft carrier the aircraft carrier 

00:02:46.780 --> 00:02:50.230
 enemy is the worst because it is an anti 

00:02:48.280 --> 00:02:51.760
 aerial or absolutely static I do not know why 

00:02:50.230 --> 00:02:53.350
 at least you can not move to attack 

00:02:51.760 --> 00:02:55.269
 the others but there is always some player 

00:02:53.350 --> 00:02:56.980
 idiot that is to put in the antiaircraft 

00:02:55.269 --> 00:02:58.209
 to try to knock you down 

00:02:56.980 --> 00:03:00.310
 even if he does not have the ability to do 

00:02:58.209 --> 00:03:01.750
 nothing else awaits them but it is true and so 

00:03:00.310 --> 00:03:04.450
 is how is the second way of 

00:03:01.750 --> 00:03:05.800
 to survive is understanding the dynamics of 

00:03:04.450 --> 00:03:07.690
 like putting behind 

00:03:05.800 --> 00:03:09.340
 the enemy pilot when they are 

00:03:07.690 --> 00:03:12.400
 chasing now a very good pilot 

00:03:09.340 --> 00:03:15.100
 it will usually be managed to keep in 

00:03:12.400 --> 00:03:16.660
 your tail and if that happens you can spend a lot 

00:03:15.100 --> 00:03:18.700
 long time trying to pursue action 

00:03:16.660 --> 00:03:20.710
 to the other but the correct way to fly 

00:03:18.700 --> 00:03:22.420
 is doing like the little circles towards 

00:03:20.710 --> 00:03:24.430
 up or trying to make small 

00:03:22.420 --> 00:03:27.130
 as a light loop is called a blog in English 

00:03:24.430 --> 00:03:29.020
 and when you are in heaven be of 

00:03:27.130 --> 00:03:30.400
 back try to lower the 

00:03:29.020 --> 00:03:32.260
 speed and then change direction 

00:03:30.400 --> 00:03:33.490
 either to the right or to the left to 

00:03:32.260 --> 00:03:37.060
 keep the enemy 

00:03:33.490 --> 00:03:38.080
 as it is called completely on its 

00:03:37.060 --> 00:03:40.570
 wide so you do not know exactly 

00:03:38.080 --> 00:03:42.970
 where are you now a common way of 

00:03:40.570 --> 00:03:44.770
 try to locate the enemy when 

00:03:42.970 --> 00:03:46.440
 you are following is to change the 

00:03:44.770 --> 00:03:48.850
 third-person perspective of the jet 

00:03:46.440 --> 00:03:50.680
 in barÃ³n filtres it worked super well 

00:03:48.850 --> 00:03:52.570
 However 4 has the problem that when 

00:03:50.680 --> 00:03:52.930
 you get to the perspective of third 

00:03:52.570 --> 00:03:54.910
 person 

00:03:52.930 --> 00:03:56.800
 the camera is very close to the plane 

00:03:54.910 --> 00:03:59.020
 then you lose a little bit of sight 

00:03:56.800 --> 00:04:00.310
 but that can be useful for you 

00:03:59.020 --> 00:04:02.200
 help look here that is following me in 

00:04:00.310 --> 00:04:03.970
 the enemy pilot I'm doing the turn 

00:04:02.200 --> 00:04:05.790
 perfect at 300 kilometers per hour 

00:04:03.970 --> 00:04:08.590
 what am I saying and the enemy 

00:04:05.790 --> 00:04:10.060
 starts to spin very slowly which 

00:04:08.590 --> 00:04:11.530
 he gives me permission to put myself behind him 

00:04:10.060 --> 00:04:14.110
 in addition to 

00:04:11.530 --> 00:04:16.180
 and it's the important thing if you can do it 

00:04:14.110 --> 00:04:17.980
 because he told me he went down a lot 

00:04:16.180 --> 00:04:19.959
 speed then it gets there gives me 

00:04:17.980 --> 00:04:21.700
 permission to fire on active missiles 

00:04:19.959 --> 00:04:23.650
 which are the best weapon you can have 

00:04:21.700 --> 00:04:26.110
 which they are missiles that do not require you 

00:04:23.650 --> 00:04:28.510
 what is the enemy but really 

00:04:26.110 --> 00:04:31.810
 the missile is going to chase the enemy where 

00:04:28.510 --> 00:04:34.000
 is now passing by when the 

00:04:31.810 --> 00:04:35.860
 enemy try to evade you can you 

00:04:34.000 --> 00:04:39.130
 try to stay a bit away from him 

00:04:35.860 --> 00:04:42.100
 and you will attack it from afar 

00:04:39.130 --> 00:04:43.810
 to try to shoot him down with weapons 

00:04:42.100 --> 00:04:45.669
 which are very effective and a 

00:04:43.810 --> 00:04:48.160
 lots of people try not to use them 

00:04:45.669 --> 00:04:50.350
 they try what you have to do is you 

00:04:48.160 --> 00:04:52.240
 pay attention to which are the best 

00:04:50.350 --> 00:04:54.220
 weapons that you can use in the jet in 

00:04:52.240 --> 00:04:56.800
 my opinion is the 30 mm cannon 

00:04:54.220 --> 00:04:58.360
 and the active missiles not the missiles 

00:04:56.800 --> 00:05:01.000
 passives that are what you need 

00:04:58.360 --> 00:05:02.740
 block the enemy and the way 

00:05:01.000 --> 00:05:04.600
 correct to unblock the because 

00:05:02.740 --> 00:05:06.460
 It's probably going to take you many hours 

00:05:04.600 --> 00:05:07.660
 of flight and crash you a thousand times because 

00:05:06.460 --> 00:05:09.400
 they will always be knocking you down 

00:05:07.660 --> 00:05:12.310
 anti-aircraft is that you enter any 

00:05:09.400 --> 00:05:14.650
 game of air superiority and there if 

00:05:12.310 --> 00:05:16.030
 you face planes against planes in 

00:05:14.650 --> 00:05:17.740
 air superiority you can fly 

00:05:16.030 --> 00:05:18.310
 helicopters that obviously do not go 

00:05:17.740 --> 00:05:20.680
 benefit 

00:05:18.310 --> 00:05:22.750
 in this tutorial but you can fly to 

00:05:20.680 --> 00:05:25.360
 furtive jets in games where they can 

00:05:22.750 --> 00:05:27.670
 have 12 aircraft 24 million in the air 

00:05:25.360 --> 00:05:29.410
 which is very entertaining the truth for 

00:05:27.670 --> 00:05:31.300
 playing it as a mini game is not that the 

00:05:29.410 --> 00:05:33.310
 of longevity really alvaro action 

00:05:31.300 --> 00:05:36.310
 but it's definitely a good way 

00:05:33.310 --> 00:05:40.480
 to understand the dynamics or how they 

00:05:36.310 --> 00:05:42.760
 calls the figures and the dynamics and 

00:05:40.480 --> 00:05:44.740
 physical of flying the plane and obviously 

00:05:42.760 --> 00:05:46.750
 how the enemies fly to try to 

00:05:44.740 --> 00:05:48.010
 put behind them what is here 

00:05:46.750 --> 00:05:48.970
 I'm going to leave them and I'm going to finish the 

00:05:48.010 --> 00:05:51.940
 video but I will not leave with the 

00:05:48.970 --> 00:05:53.920
 return of the catch of the sport of 

00:05:51.940 --> 00:05:55.120
 coffee border because it's very intuitive and 

00:05:53.920 --> 00:05:56.380
 adam guys and they liked the team 

00:05:55.120 --> 00:05:59.640
 right now if we liked what the 

00:05:56.380 --> 00:05:59.640
 win and until next time
