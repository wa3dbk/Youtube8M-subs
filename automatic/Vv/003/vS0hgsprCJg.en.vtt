 fal 

00:00:35.030 --> 00:00:39.530
 we have the assistant doctor in her daily work in the power play 

00:00:39.530 --> 00:00:42.910
 Currently an education to everything is in a hospital Ernst of miner 

00:00:43.659 --> 00:00:47.379
 actually wanted to be raised but is as a newcomer two 

00:00:47.379 --> 00:00:49.500
 injured are welcome 

00:00:49.500 --> 00:00:51.500
 the lawn is one 

00:00:51.500 --> 00:00:55.420
 different as theme from the outset than they do or get in and am 

00:00:55.420 --> 00:00:58.730
 Now real estate market that will attract people with seamless 

00:00:58.730 --> 00:01:02.210
 and if it was totally enjoyable it was just interesting 

00:01:02.210 --> 00:01:03.090
 it 

00:01:03.090 --> 00:01:06.649
 that it manages to make a major surgery painless and easy 

00:01:07.330 --> 00:01:10.580
 in order to understand relatively online that one understands one's health 

00:01:10.580 --> 00:01:13.060
 responsible for this is the city of Esslingen 

00:01:13.060 --> 00:01:15.979
 one and the circle of his familiar ones imposed with it 

00:01:15.979 --> 00:01:19.720
 at Hansa Rostock "We are shaken by the normal air 

00:01:19.719 --> 00:01:21.550
 continue 

00:01:21.550 --> 00:01:25.980
 to prepare the patient for VP complete monitoring of district council 

00:01:25.980 --> 00:01:27.180
 during the procedure 

00:01:27.180 --> 00:01:30.180
 These are the main tasks of this therapy in the Official 

00:01:31.170 --> 00:01:32.259
 there are no rights 

00:01:32.259 --> 00:01:35.259
 Simply tax medicines no less positively 

00:01:35.930 --> 00:01:39.090
 Reason is something that I greatly deteriorate as improved even if 

00:01:39.090 --> 00:01:41.730
 it has no pain Met 

00:01:41.730 --> 00:01:43.249
 already for two and a half years 

00:01:43.249 --> 00:01:46.739
 Inwischen young assistant doctor Zorn is it is a trained the 

00:01:46.739 --> 00:01:49.500
 Specialist training lasts a total of five years 

00:01:49.500 --> 00:01:52.630
 Hand play by Ernst von Bergmann appreciate above all the good care 

00:01:53.760 --> 00:01:57.200
 it says President rejected 1 

00:01:57.200 --> 00:01:58.860
 To explain things 

00:01:58.860 --> 00:02:02.010
 and if you would like to do a lot yourself but just 

00:02:02.010 --> 00:02:05.490
 she will or in my education has always put a lot of emphasis on that 

00:02:06.360 --> 00:02:09.830
 a sound education takes place and therefore I am the process 

00:02:09.830 --> 00:02:11.719
 in another country has a mentor 

00:02:11.719 --> 00:02:14.829
 Herne has taken care of the needs of what I like 

00:02:14.829 --> 00:02:16.529
 wanted 

00:02:16.529 --> 00:02:20.139
 The center for anesthesia costs about 50 Hausen a year 

00:02:20.139 --> 00:02:21.449
 carried out 

00:02:21.449 --> 00:02:25.079
 Another large task of the anesthetists at the hospital Ernst von 

00:02:25.079 --> 00:02:28.079
 Miner is the problem management 

00:02:29.749 --> 00:02:33.449
 this is our hobby plans for tomorrow we work as in this 

00:02:33.449 --> 00:02:37.029
 she mixes here in the central area exist and pull 

00:02:38.049 --> 00:02:41.920
 at the moment seven o'clock to 10 o'clock they have 21 o'clock in two shifts 

00:02:42.639 --> 00:02:45.859
 indisputably the ones we have about 13 

00:02:47.019 --> 00:02:51.499
 full-time occupied operational subjects the only thing we do not here 

00:02:51.499 --> 00:02:54.669
 offer announces transplant agree 

00:02:54.669 --> 00:02:58.309
 A total of 48 anesthetists perform the entire spectrum 

00:02:58.859 --> 00:03:03.019
 while the doctors and sisters of the latest technology available 

00:03:03.019 --> 00:03:06.019
 has great appearance at the Klinikum Ernst von Bergmann that before one and a half 

00:03:06.019 --> 00:03:09.039
 Been re-commissioned years ago 

00:03:09.039 --> 00:03:11.319
 that could not work out 

00:03:11.319 --> 00:03:14.319
 while that 

00:03:17.419 --> 00:03:20.419
 So a bit funny from my point of view also what the 

00:03:20.419 --> 00:03:22.999
 applied medication affects 

00:03:22.999 --> 00:03:28.469
 highest minutes level of the game halftime has been to 7 with 1770 

00:03:29.649 --> 00:03:32.760
 another important task of the anesthesiologist 

00:03:32.760 --> 00:03:34.589
 now is the intensive care medicine 

00:03:34.589 --> 00:03:39.479
 Intensive Therapy is one of three intensive care units at the hospital 

00:03:39.479 --> 00:03:44.549
 Ernst von Bergmann and has 18 beds a year are ever more than 1000 

00:03:44.549 --> 00:03:48.619
 Patients supplied the requirements, above all, are to the nursing staff 

00:03:48.619 --> 00:03:50.719
 high I was so nice seriously ill 

00:03:50.719 --> 00:03:55.489
 because often under 10 percent for the left actually everything so everything 

00:03:55.489 --> 00:03:57.209
 closely 

00:03:57.209 --> 00:03:59.339
 what to do and to care for 

00:03:59.339 --> 00:04:04.459
 Wolz says centrally that all needs of the headbanger mean five percent 

00:04:04.459 --> 00:04:07.009
 was better or a little in the way 

00:04:07.009 --> 00:04:09.019
 and the Home Office 

00:04:09.019 --> 00:04:11.879
 the technically paparazzi at and staffing for the 

00:04:11.879 --> 00:04:14.600
 Experiencing life-sustaining treatment is great 

00:04:14.600 --> 00:04:17.940
 The close cooperation between doctors and nurses is on the 

00:04:17.940 --> 00:04:22.300
 Intensive care unit is particularly important so that seriously ill patients are also optimally 

00:04:22.300 --> 00:04:23.440
 can be supplied
