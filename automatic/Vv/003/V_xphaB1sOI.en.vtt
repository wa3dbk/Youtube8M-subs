00:02:19.840 --> 00:02:21.090 
partnerships and relationships so that
we<00:02:20.049> can<00:02:20.200> think<00:02:20.380> strategically<00:02:20.620> about

00:02:21.090 --> 00:02:21.100 
we can think strategically about

00:02:21.100 --> 00:02:23.640 
we can think strategically about
alliances<00:02:21.610> on<00:02:22.030> the<00:02:22.120> ground<00:02:22.329> in<00:02:22.540> Haiti<00:02:22.780> and<00:02:23.079> so

00:02:23.640 --> 00:02:23.650 
alliances on the ground in Haiti and so

00:02:23.650 --> 00:02:25.500 
alliances on the ground in Haiti and so
that<00:02:23.890> we<00:02:24.010> can<00:02:24.250> insert<00:02:24.610> ourselves<00:02:24.790> in<00:02:25.269> ways

00:02:25.500 --> 00:02:25.510 
that we can insert ourselves in ways

00:02:25.510 --> 00:02:27.479 
that we can insert ourselves in ways
that<00:02:25.540> are<00:02:25.870> dictated<00:02:26.470> actually<00:02:26.769> by<00:02:26.920> people<00:02:27.280> in

00:02:27.479 --> 00:02:27.489 
that are dictated actually by people in

00:02:27.489 --> 00:02:29.580 
that are dictated actually by people in
Haiti<00:02:28.120> rather<00:02:28.480> than<00:02:28.660> us<00:02:28.870> deciding<00:02:29.410> what<00:02:29.560> they

00:02:29.580 --> 00:02:29.590 
Haiti rather than us deciding what they

00:02:29.590 --> 00:02:32.280 
Haiti rather than us deciding what they
need<00:02:30.040> which<00:02:30.280> is<00:02:30.310> a<00:02:30.609> very<00:02:30.850> typical<00:02:31.060> approach<00:02:31.480> to

00:02:32.280 --> 00:02:32.290 
need which is a very typical approach to

00:02:32.290 --> 00:02:33.780 
need which is a very typical approach to
this<00:02:32.410> kind<00:02:32.650> of<00:02:32.829> post<00:02:33.130> crisis<00:02:33.549> intervention

00:02:33.780 --> 00:02:33.790 
this kind of post crisis intervention

00:02:33.790 --> 00:02:36.120 
this kind of post crisis intervention

00:02:36.120 --> 00:02:36.130 
but really that redevelopment has to be

00:02:36.130 --> 00:02:37.860 
but really that redevelopment has to be
organic<00:02:36.310> and<00:02:36.880> coming<00:02:37.209> from<00:02:37.359> the<00:02:37.540> people<00:02:37.840> who
