00:00:09.070 --> 00:00:16.070
 How to make a simple light sensor. What do you need, for this project? 

00:00:16.470 --> 00:00:23.470
 An LDR (photosensitive resistor), we also refer to photo resistance or expansion 

00:00:25.140 --> 00:00:32.140
 Cadmium sulfide cells. LED (light emitting diode), of which 

00:00:36.690 --> 00:00:43.190
 The longer part is the anode and the shorter part is the cathode. 

00:00:43.190 --> 00:00:50.190
 A K ohm resistor. If you don't have a K ohm resistor, you can also use three or three 

00:00:51.329 --> 00:00:58.329
 An ohmic resistor replaces it. Nine-volt battery. 

00:00:58.850 --> 00:01:05.850
 Nine-volt battery clip. Moreover, experiment with the board. 

00:01:10.840 --> 00:01:14.670
 The breadboard of the positive power rail, this is the negative voltage rail. 

00:01:14.670 --> 00:01:21.670
 And here is the circuit diagram. We first insert the LDR board. 

00:01:29.490 --> 00:01:36.490
 We actively LDR on the first end of the railway breadboard connection 

00:01:55.750 --> 00:01:59.320
 A K ohm resistor. We will be on the LED circuit board. 

00:01:59.320 --> 00:02:06.320
 We connect the LEDs to the cathode negative rail of the breadboard. 

00:02:15.510 --> 00:02:22.510
 The anode of our LED is connected and the LDR is connected to the second terminal. 

00:02:32.389 --> 00:02:39.389
 Now, our nine-volt battery clip is connected to a nine-volt battery. 

00:02:51.820 --> 00:02:57.449
 The negative pole of our battery is connected to the negative track of the test board. 

00:02:57.449 --> 00:03:04.449
 And positive positive track. You can see the LED fill light. 

00:03:12.060 --> 00:03:17.820
 The LDR is the brightness according to the intensity or brightness of the received light. 

00:03:17.820 --> 00:03:24.820
 LED. We can also use a three-volt power supply 

00:03:45.560 --> 00:03:50.510
 For this project. For this we will need nine volts 

00:03:50.510 --> 00:03:57.510
 Battery and resistance. We take a positive three-volt power supply 

00:04:00.229 --> 00:04:05.910
 And insert it into the positive iron of the breadboard. 

00:04:05.910 --> 00:04:12.910
 And negative negative rails. We insert the wire from a part of the LDR 

00:04:16.979 --> 00:04:23.979
 Active railway breadboards and LED lighting. 

00:04:47.810 --> 00:04:48.510
 Watch THANX.
