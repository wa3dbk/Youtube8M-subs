00:01:35.429 --> 00:01:44.280
 snow and more 

00:01:38.450 --> 00:01:47.429
 are obtained from water allowed days water in 

00:01:44.280 --> 00:01:51.599
 the seas and oceans evaporates turns 

00:01:47.429 --> 00:01:54.270
 in the steam that rises to the top but there 

00:01:51.599 --> 00:01:59.420
 above the farther from the surface of the earth 

00:01:54.270 --> 00:02:02.310
 the colder and colder there are 

00:01:59.420 --> 00:02:05.160
 freezes steam turns into small 

00:02:02.310 --> 00:02:07.649
 transparent ice crystals which 

00:02:05.160 --> 00:02:12.120
 scatter in all directions and so you 

00:02:07.649 --> 00:02:14.580
 went fly they fly and then 

00:02:12.120 --> 00:02:21.270
 are attached to each other and are formed 

00:02:14.580 --> 00:02:24.599
 the snowflakes are very beautiful and everything is different 

00:02:21.270 --> 00:02:27.270
 snowflakes of identical patterns true god 

00:02:24.599 --> 00:02:31.599
 I did not notice something because the filet 

00:02:27.270 --> 00:02:34.489
 they look so small 

00:02:31.599 --> 00:02:37.370
 That's how they look at large 

00:02:34.489 --> 00:02:40.159
 increasing the caravan is really very 

00:02:37.370 --> 00:02:43.010
 different but there are between snowflakes and 

00:02:40.159 --> 00:02:45.650
 the similarity of each snowflake six faces 

00:02:43.010 --> 00:02:48.859
 no more no less and they grow from them 

00:02:45.650 --> 00:02:51.950
 smooth rays probably here from these 

00:02:48.859 --> 00:02:56.840
