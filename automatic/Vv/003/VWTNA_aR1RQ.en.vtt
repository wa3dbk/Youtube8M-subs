00:00:45.170 --> 00:00:45.180 
the joy that it brings is worth the pain

00:00:45.180 --> 00:00:47.600

of<00:00:45.210> its<00:00:45.539> eventual<00:00:45.899> or<00:00:46.500> possible<00:00:46.950> dissolution

00:00:47.600 --> 00:00:47.610 
of its eventual or possible dissolution

00:00:47.610 --> 00:00:49.279 
of its eventual or possible dissolution
so<00:00:47.760> kind<00:00:48.180> of<00:00:48.270> wanted<00:00:48.480> to<00:00:48.570> deal<00:00:48.750> with<00:00:48.930> that<00:00:49.079> and

00:00:49.279 --> 00:00:49.289 
so kind of wanted to deal with that and

00:00:49.289 --> 00:00:50.930 
so kind of wanted to deal with that and
I<00:00:49.440> also<00:00:49.680> realized<00:00:50.250> that<00:00:50.370> if<00:00:50.520> you<00:00:50.550> looked<00:00:50.820> at

00:00:50.930 --> 00:00:50.940 
I also realized that if you looked at

00:00:50.940 --> 00:00:53.240 
I also realized that if you looked at
the<00:00:51.180> symptoms<00:00:51.660> of<00:00:51.809> romantic<00:00:52.260> love<00:00:52.289> especially

the symptoms of romantic love especially

00:00:53.250 --> 00:00:54.799

in<00:00:53.370> its<00:00:53.489> early<00:00:53.789> stages<00:00:53.820> it<00:00:54.329> actually<00:00:54.660> has<00:00:54.780> a

00:00:54.799 --> 00:00:54.809 
in its early stages it actually has a

00:00:54.809 --> 00:00:57.170 
in its early stages it actually has a
lot<00:00:55.140> in<00:00:55.320> common<00:00:55.350> with<00:00:55.710> the<00:00:56.250> psychiatric

00:00:57.170 --> 00:00:57.180 
lot in common with the psychiatric

00:00:57.180 --> 00:00:58.549 
lot in common with the psychiatric
disorders<00:00:57.600> we<00:00:57.750> normally<00:00:58.140> treat<00:00:58.410> with

00:00:58.549 --> 00:00:58.559 
disorders we normally treat with

00:00:58.559 --> 00:01:00.860 
disorders we normally treat with
medication<00:00:59.160> so<00:00:59.879> that's<00:01:00.090> how<00:01:00.239> the<00:01:00.270> idea<00:01:00.420> was

00:01:00.860 --> 00:01:00.870 
medication so that's how the idea was

00:01:00.870 --> 00:01:03.080 
medication so that's how the idea was
born<00:01:01.109> and<00:01:01.800> now<00:01:01.949> that<00:01:02.129> the<00:01:02.219> trilogy<00:01:02.670> is<00:01:02.730> over
