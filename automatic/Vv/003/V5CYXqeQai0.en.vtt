00:00:00.770 --> 00:00:10.650
 today is January 16, 2015 early in the morning 

00:00:05.819 --> 00:00:12.960
 about half past four woke up 

00:00:10.650 --> 00:00:14.120
 loud bang and drop some 

00:00:12.960 --> 00:00:18.510
 items 

00:00:14.120 --> 00:00:20.670
 Well, you tell analyzed the situation 

00:00:18.510 --> 00:00:22.890
 I thought something just fell off 

00:00:20.670 --> 00:00:25.650
 the table can someone pushed something mouse 

00:00:22.890 --> 00:00:28.230
 there or code which was a surprise when i 

00:00:25.650 --> 00:00:33.840
 went out into the corridor on the floor were batteries 

00:00:28.230 --> 00:00:36.980
 and squeezed such an incomprehensible thing from where 

00:00:33.840 --> 00:00:41.329
 again, the persons superior miscalculation is 

00:00:36.980 --> 00:00:46.489
 the cat was not at home at that moment 

00:00:41.329 --> 00:00:46.489
 well , just like something fell 

00:00:46.879 --> 00:00:53.910
 checking further content 

00:00:49.500 --> 00:00:55.430
 next standing in the boxes I found here 

00:00:53.910 --> 00:00:59.989
 such a thing 

00:00:55.430 --> 00:01:02.809
 just a duracell battery 

00:00:59.989 --> 00:01:07.560
 spontaneously exploded at night 

00:01:02.809 --> 00:01:11.939
 scattering everything around and dropping to the floor 

00:01:07.560 --> 00:01:15.869
 under these little batteries so here it was 

00:01:11.939 --> 00:01:22.350
 a carnation that's part of it 

00:01:15.869 --> 00:01:29.329
 batteries minus with pin opposite 

00:01:22.350 --> 00:01:31.829
 locker door and on the door is discovered here 

00:01:29.329 --> 00:01:34.590
 scratches two scratches that is 

00:01:31.829 --> 00:01:37.590
 It turns out in front of the locker battery 

00:01:34.590 --> 00:01:39.840
 exploded particles flew through the door 

00:01:37.590 --> 00:01:42.299
 scratching the glass thank god shawn not 

00:01:39.840 --> 00:01:46.670
 crashed and scattered around these 

00:01:42.299 --> 00:01:46.670
 duracell batteries 

00:01:50.750 --> 00:01:56.130
 then right after that I went to 

00:01:53.670 --> 00:01:59.490
 the Internet looked at similar cases 

00:01:56.130 --> 00:02:00.390
 it turns out there are similar cases man 

00:01:59.490 --> 00:02:03.659
 also laid out 

00:02:00.390 --> 00:02:06.350
 this situation will also fall and he 

00:02:03.659 --> 00:02:07.500
 the batteries in the box exploded 

00:02:06.350 --> 00:02:09.289
 spontaneously 

00:02:07.500 --> 00:02:11.760
 the battery was not connected to anything 

00:02:09.289 --> 00:02:16.620
 it is as if slightly used after 

00:02:11.760 --> 00:02:19.020
 flash and lay for setting and 

00:02:16.620 --> 00:02:22.650
 flow remote or somewhere else per hour and 

00:02:19.020 --> 00:02:24.209
 she would have worked long all the time 

00:02:22.650 --> 00:02:26.630
 how many batteries do you use again 

00:02:24.209 --> 00:02:28.680
 buy batteries duracell films 

00:02:26.630 --> 00:02:30.120
 imagine what would happen if such 

00:02:28.680 --> 00:02:32.970
 the battery exploded simply in 

00:02:30.120 --> 00:02:35.310
 hands at home temperature was 

00:02:32.970 --> 00:02:37.800
 Well, I would not say that it's hot because 

00:02:35.310 --> 00:02:40.170
 I have a boiler in the street almost no heat 

00:02:37.800 --> 00:02:42.600
 drowned batteries were hungry that is from 

00:02:40.170 --> 00:02:44.760
 overheating she could not from the circuit she 

00:02:42.600 --> 00:02:47.040
 also could not break happened 

00:02:44.760 --> 00:02:50.520
 spontaneous explosion of this battery 

00:02:47.040 --> 00:02:52.860
 people be careful especially children to 

00:02:50.520 --> 00:02:54.270
 put batteries in these in toys children 

00:02:52.860 --> 00:02:56.370
 these batteries are played 

00:02:54.270 --> 00:02:57.890
 This is not the first case. 

00:02:56.370 --> 00:03:01.640
 firms duracell 

00:02:57.890 --> 00:03:01.640
 spontaneous battery explosion
