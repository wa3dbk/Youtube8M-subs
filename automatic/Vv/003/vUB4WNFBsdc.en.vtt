jagged arches and battle right there has

00:00:44.520 --> 00:00:47.510 
jagged arches and battle right there has
a<00:00:44.550> little<00:00:44.910> hole<00:00:45.090> on<00:00:45.270> it<00:00:45.530> on<00:00:46.530> your<00:00:46.710> side<00:00:46.920> too

00:00:47.510 --> 00:00:47.520 
a little hole on it on your side too

and by tomorrow morning these pieces

00:00:52.650 --> 00:00:58.760 
and by tomorrow morning these pieces
should<00:00:52.980> be<00:00:53.240> cured<00:00:54.240> and<00:00:57.200> puts<00:00:58.200> a<00:00:58.290> little<00:00:58.560> bit<00:00:58.680> of

00:00:58.760 --> 00:00:58.770 
should be cured and puts a little bit of

00:00:58.770 --> 00:01:02.420 
should be cured and puts a little bit of
sand<00:00:59.040> on<00:00:59.160> top<00:00:59.190> of<00:00:59.520> this<00:00:59.640> one<00:01:01.130> let's<00:01:02.130> see<00:01:02.280> how

00:01:02.420 --> 00:01:02.430 
sand on top of this one let's see how

00:01:02.430 --> 00:01:05.389 
sand on top of this one let's see how
this<00:01:02.610> comes<00:01:02.880> up<00:01:03.090> and<00:01:03.480> turns<00:01:03.810> out<00:01:04.019> there<00:01:04.320> is<00:01:04.500> the

00:01:05.389 --> 00:01:05.399 
this comes up and turns out there is the

00:01:05.399 --> 00:01:07.929 
this comes up and turns out there is the
bottom<00:01:05.759> pieces<00:01:05.969> I<00:01:06.119> didn't<00:01:06.359> put<00:01:06.539> salt<00:01:06.899> in<00:01:07.109> it

00:01:07.929 --> 00:01:07.939 
bottom pieces I didn't put salt in it

00:01:07.939 --> 00:01:10.550 
bottom pieces I didn't put salt in it
the<00:01:08.939> top<00:01:09.210> you<00:01:09.420> said<00:01:09.659> you<00:01:09.780> put<00:01:09.990> salt<00:01:10.170> I<00:01:10.320> wanted

00:01:10.550 --> 00:01:10.560 
the top you said you put salt I wanted

00:01:10.560 --> 00:01:15.709 
the top you said you put salt I wanted
to<00:01:10.649> become<00:01:10.770> very<00:01:11.100> porous<00:01:12.170> so<00:01:13.939> we<00:01:14.939> get<00:01:15.179> a<00:01:15.210> detail

00:01:15.709 --> 00:01:15.719 
to become very porous so we get a detail

00:01:15.719 --> 00:01:19.940 
to become very porous so we get a detail
a<00:01:15.990> little<00:01:16.679> lower<00:01:18.109> jagged<00:01:19.109> these<00:01:19.229> pieces<00:01:19.590> look

00:01:19.940 --> 00:01:19.950 
a little lower jagged these pieces look

00:01:19.950 --> 00:01:22.639 
a little lower jagged these pieces look
kind<00:01:20.399> of<00:01:20.490> rugged<00:01:20.729> looking<00:01:21.289> so<00:01:22.289> this<00:01:22.469> should

00:01:22.639 --> 00:01:22.649 
kind of rugged looking so this should

00:01:22.649 --> 00:01:26.179 
kind of rugged looking so this should
look<00:01:22.770> good<00:01:22.799> and<00:01:23.189> a<00:01:23.700> nice<00:01:24.359> tank<00:01:24.719> as<00:01:25.679> you<00:01:25.890> can<00:01:26.039> see

00:01:26.179 --> 00:01:26.189 
look good and a nice tank as you can see

00:01:26.189 --> 00:01:29.080 
look good and a nice tank as you can see
has<00:01:26.369> a<00:01:26.399> lot<00:01:26.640> of<00:01:26.670> little<00:01:27.060> clips<00:01:27.420> on<00:01:27.600> it<00:01:27.780> a<00:01:27.990> little

00:01:29.080 --> 00:01:29.090 
has a lot of little clips on it a little

00:01:29.090 --> 00:01:32.090 
has a lot of little clips on it a little
bumps<00:01:30.090> on<00:01:30.240> it<00:01:30.299> so<00:01:30.569> you<00:01:30.689> should<00:01:30.780> be<00:01:31.020> good<00:01:31.679> for

00:01:32.090 --> 00:01:32.100 
bumps on it so you should be good for

00:01:32.100 --> 00:01:34.489 
bumps on it so you should be good for
putting<00:01:32.280> some<00:01:32.579> cores<00:01:32.850> on<00:01:33.090> there<00:01:33.270> later<00:01:34.229> on

00:01:34.489 --> 00:01:34.499 
putting some cores on there later on

00:01:34.499 --> 00:01:37.520 
putting some cores on there later on
when<00:01:34.740> they're<00:01:34.950> inside<00:01:35.189> of<00:01:35.249> a<00:01:35.399> tank<00:01:36.530> probably

00:01:37.520 --> 00:01:37.530 
when they're inside of a tank probably

00:01:37.530 --> 00:01:42.859 
when they're inside of a tank probably
epoxy<00:01:38.130> them<00:01:38.219> to<00:01:38.909> the<00:01:39.240> rock<00:01:39.689> and<00:01:41.539> in<00:01:42.539> a<00:01:42.659> couple

00:01:42.859 --> 00:01:42.869 
epoxy them to the rock and in a couple

00:01:42.869 --> 00:01:46.450 
epoxy them to the rock and in a couple
weeks<00:01:43.340> once<00:01:44.340> I<00:01:44.460> put<00:01:44.670> them<00:01:44.789> in<00:01:44.909> water<00:01:45.149> and<00:01:45.450> put

00:01:46.450 --> 00:01:46.460 
weeks once I put them in water and put

00:01:46.460 --> 00:01:49.240 
weeks once I put them in water and put
them<00:01:47.460> in

00:01:49.240 --> 00:01:49.250 
them in

00:01:49.250 --> 00:01:52.330 
them in
and<00:01:49.760> a<00:01:50.240> container<00:01:50.660> with<00:01:51.590> normal<00:01:52.220> water

00:01:52.330 --> 00:01:52.340 
and a container with normal water

00:01:52.340 --> 00:01:55.030 
and a container with normal water
changes<00:01:52.960> these<00:01:53.960> pieces<00:01:54.290> should<00:01:54.620> be<00:01:54.770> able<00:01:54.860> to

00:01:55.030 --> 00:01:55.040 
changes these pieces should be able to

00:01:55.040 --> 00:01:58.840 
changes these pieces should be able to
be<00:01:55.370> ready<00:01:55.880> to<00:01:56.060> put<00:01:56.240> in<00:01:56.330> a<00:01:56.420> Reef<00:01:56.810> Aquarium<00:01:57.850> the

00:01:58.840 --> 00:01:58.850 
be ready to put in a Reef Aquarium the

00:01:58.850 --> 00:02:00.730 
be ready to put in a Reef Aquarium the
whole<00:01:58.970> process<00:01:59.240> takes<00:01:59.540> about<00:01:59.630> maybe<00:01:59.990> three<00:02:00.500> to

00:02:00.730 --> 00:02:00.740 
whole process takes about maybe three to

00:02:00.740 --> 00:02:04.600 
whole process takes about maybe three to
four<00:02:00.950> weeks<00:02:01.190> and<00:02:02.200> I<00:02:03.200> check<00:02:03.560> the<00:02:03.710> pH<00:02:03.920> on<00:02:04.250> it<00:02:04.460> and

00:02:04.600 --> 00:02:04.610 
four weeks and I check the pH on it and

00:02:04.610 --> 00:02:09.130 
four weeks and I check the pH on it and
the<00:02:04.670> salt<00:02:05.000> levels<00:02:05.360> and<00:02:07.600> they<00:02:08.600> should<00:02:08.840> be<00:02:08.990> on

00:02:09.130 --> 00:02:09.140 
the salt levels and they should be on

00:02:09.140 --> 00:02:12.760 
the salt levels and they should be on
their<00:02:09.259> way<00:02:10.690> so<00:02:11.690> once<00:02:11.870> again<00:02:12.020> I<00:02:12.170> want<00:02:12.350> to<00:02:12.500> share
