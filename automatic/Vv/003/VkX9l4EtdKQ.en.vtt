00:02:57.729 --> 00:02:57.739 
things that you can tell your defensive

00:02:57.739 --> 00:02:59.709 
things that you can tell your defensive
lineman<00:02:58.069> to<00:02:58.370> look<00:02:58.519> for<00:02:58.760> as<00:02:58.849> an<00:02:58.969> offense<00:02:59.329> of<00:02:59.540> the

00:02:59.709 --> 00:02:59.719 
lineman to look for as an offense of the

00:02:59.719 --> 00:03:01.089 
lineman to look for as an offense of the
