00:00:03.210 --> 00:00:03.220 
in this lesson we're going to cover some

00:00:03.220 --> 00:00:04.800 
in this lesson we're going to cover some
of<00:00:03.399> the<00:00:03.520> basic<00:00:04.000> post<00:00:04.359> installation

00:00:04.800 --> 00:00:04.810 
of the basic post installation

00:00:04.810 --> 00:00:07.230 
of the basic post installation
configuration<00:00:05.319> steps<00:00:06.220> we<00:00:06.609> would<00:00:06.700> perform<00:00:07.120> on

00:00:07.230 --> 00:00:07.240 
configuration steps we would perform on

00:00:07.240 --> 00:00:09.570 
configuration steps we would perform on
the<00:00:07.359> new<00:00:07.509> Windows<00:00:07.930> Server<00:00:08.290> 2012<00:00:08.650> installation

the new Windows Server 2012 installation
in<00:00:09.760> this<00:00:10.630> example<00:00:11.050> I'm<00:00:11.530> going<00:00:11.769> to<00:00:11.830> use<00:00:12.070> the

00:00:12.270 --> 00:00:12.280 
in this example I'm going to use the

00:00:12.280 --> 00:00:14.520 
in this example I'm going to use the
local<00:00:12.730> graphical<00:00:13.150> interface<00:00:13.690> to<00:00:14.139> configure

local graphical interface to configure
this<00:00:14.650> server<00:00:14.950> and<00:00:15.490> of<00:00:15.610> course<00:00:15.790> we<00:00:16.000> could

00:00:16.170 --> 00:00:16.180 
this server and of course we could

00:00:16.180 --> 00:00:17.849 
this server and of course we could
remove<00:00:16.509> that<00:00:16.570> graphical<00:00:17.230> interface<00:00:17.590> at<00:00:17.830> a

00:00:17.849 --> 00:00:17.859 
remove that graphical interface at a

00:00:17.859 --> 00:00:18.689 
remove that graphical interface at a
later<00:00:18.100> time

00:00:18.689 --> 00:00:18.699 
later time

00:00:18.699 --> 00:00:20.310 
later time
I'd<00:00:19.210> also<00:00:19.390> show<00:00:19.779> you<00:00:19.840> some<00:00:19.960> of<00:00:20.260> the

and<00:05:32.710> I'm<00:05:32.830> done<00:05:33.190> I've<00:05:33.250> now<00:05:33.790> configured<00:05:34.300> that

00:05:34.410 --> 00:05:34.420 
and I'm done I've now configured that

00:05:34.420 --> 00:05:37.110 
and I'm done I've now configured that
address<00:05:34.810> and<00:05:35.340> that<00:05:36.340> would<00:05:36.490> also<00:05:36.670> be<00:05:37.030> available

00:05:37.110 --> 00:05:37.120 
address and that would also be available

00:05:37.120 --> 00:05:39.620 
address and that would also be available
if<00:05:37.930> I<00:05:38.020> now<00:05:38.200> look<00:05:38.410> in<00:05:38.620> the<00:05:38.740> graphical<00:05:39.160> interface

00:05:39.620 --> 00:05:39.630 
if I now look in the graphical interface

00:05:39.630 --> 00:05:42.810 
if I now look in the graphical interface
so<00:05:40.630> it's<00:05:40.780> always<00:05:40.990> a<00:05:41.290> command-line<00:05:42.190> option<00:05:42.730> of

00:05:42.810 --> 00:05:42.820 
so it's always a command-line option of

00:05:42.820 --> 00:05:44.390 
so it's always a command-line option of
course<00:05:42.910> I<00:05:43.030> could<00:05:43.180> use<00:05:43.300> PowerShell<00:05:43.660> as<00:05:43.990> well

00:05:44.390 --> 00:05:44.400 
course I could use PowerShell as well

00:05:44.400 --> 00:05:46.470 
course I could use PowerShell as well
now<00:05:45.400> they're<00:05:45.550> obviously<00:05:45.880> typically

00:05:46.470 --> 00:05:46.480 
now they're obviously typically

00:05:46.480 --> 00:05:48.420 
now they're obviously typically
additional<00:05:47.200> configurations<00:05:47.950> we<00:05:48.070> have<00:05:48.280> to

00:05:48.420 --> 00:05:48.430 
additional configurations we have to

00:05:48.430 --> 00:05:50.970 
additional configurations we have to
perform<00:05:48.760> for<00:05:48.940> IP<00:05:49.270> for<00:05:49.870> example<00:05:50.260> setting<00:05:50.500> DNS

00:05:50.970 --> 00:05:50.980 
perform for IP for example setting DNS

00:05:50.980 --> 00:05:53.220 
perform for IP for example setting DNS
servers<00:05:51.430> and<00:05:51.580> again<00:05:51.910> I<00:05:52.090> can<00:05:52.390> use<00:05:52.540> the<00:05:52.660> net<00:05:52.840> Sh

00:05:53.220 --> 00:05:53.230

00:05:53.230 --> 00:05:55.800 
servers and again I can use the net Sh
interface<00:05:53.800> command<00:05:54.280> and<00:05:54.730> this<00:05:55.000> time<00:05:55.240> set<00:05:55.600> the

00:05:55.800 --> 00:05:55.810 
interface command and this time set the

00:05:58.590 --> 00:05:58.600 
DNS servers parameters so instead of

00:05:58.600 --> 00:06:02.430 
DNS servers parameters so instead of
being<00:05:58.810> address<00:05:59.400> this<00:06:00.400> time<00:06:00.700> I<00:06:00.910> could<00:06:01.150> say<00:06:01.440> DNS

00:06:02.430 --> 00:06:02.440 
being address this time I could say DNS

00:06:02.440 --> 00:06:04.530 
being address this time I could say DNS
servers<00:06:02.950> and<00:06:03.160> then<00:06:03.880> I<00:06:03.970> would<00:06:04.090> put<00:06:04.270> in<00:06:04.330> the<00:06:04.390> name

00:06:04.530 --> 00:06:04.540 
servers and then I would put in the name

00:06:04.540 --> 00:06:08.100 
servers and then I would put in the name
of<00:06:04.750> my<00:06:05.080> DNS<00:06:05.410> server<00:06:05.680> maybe<00:06:06.070> it's<00:06:06.280> 10<00:06:06.840> and<00:06:07.840> I<00:06:07.990> can

00:06:08.100 --> 00:06:08.110 
of my DNS server maybe it's 10 and I can

00:06:08.110 --> 00:06:11.100 
of my DNS server maybe it's 10 and I can
say<00:06:08.260> it's<00:06:08.410> primary<00:06:09.510> now<00:06:10.510> in<00:06:10.630> this<00:06:10.750> example

00:06:11.100 --> 00:06:11.110 
say it's primary now in this example

00:06:11.110 --> 00:06:12.360 
say it's primary now in this example
it's<00:06:11.320> give<00:06:11.470> me<00:06:11.560> an<00:06:11.680> Eric's<00:06:11.980> that<00:06:12.130> doesn't

00:06:12.360 --> 00:06:12.370 
it's give me an Eric's that doesn't

00:06:12.370 --> 00:06:13.680 
it's give me an Eric's that doesn't
actually<00:06:12.490> exist<00:06:12.760> I'm<00:06:13.150> just<00:06:13.300> making<00:06:13.600> these

00:06:13.680 --> 00:06:13.690 
actually exist I'm just making these

00:06:13.690 --> 00:06:15.480 
actually exist I'm just making these
values<00:06:14.080> up<00:06:14.290> that<00:06:14.860> would<00:06:14.980> be<00:06:15.130> how<00:06:15.340> you<00:06:15.370> would

00:06:15.480 --> 00:06:15.490 
values up that would be how you would

00:06:15.490 --> 00:06:16.970 
values up that would be how you would
configure<00:06:15.850> it<00:06:16.030> from<00:06:16.180> the<00:06:16.270> command<00:06:16.570> line

00:06:16.970 --> 00:06:16.980 
configure it from the command line

00:06:16.980 --> 00:06:19.740 
configure it from the command line
likewise<00:06:17.980> I<00:06:18.280> could<00:06:18.460> also<00:06:18.640> use<00:06:19.150> commands<00:06:19.570> to

00:06:19.740 --> 00:06:19.750 
likewise I could also use commands to

00:06:19.750 --> 00:06:22.140 
likewise I could also use commands to
join<00:06:19.960> the<00:06:20.110> domain<00:06:20.410> I<00:06:20.680> can<00:06:21.370> also<00:06:21.490> rename<00:06:21.970> my

join the domain I can also rename my

00:06:22.150 --> 00:06:24.000 
join the domain I can also rename my
computer<00:06:22.540> to<00:06:22.630> account<00:06:22.930> and<00:06:23.320> for<00:06:23.680> both<00:06:23.830> of

computer to account and for both of
these<00:06:24.100> I<00:06:24.160> would<00:06:24.400> use<00:06:24.610> the<00:06:24.760> net<00:06:25.150> Don<00:06:25.420> come<00:06:25.690> on<00:06:25.840> so

00:06:26.700 --> 00:06:26.710 
these I would use the net Don come on so

00:06:26.710 --> 00:06:29.160 
these I would use the net Don come on so
net<00:06:26.890> Dom<00:06:27.100> allows<00:06:27.400> me<00:06:27.700> to<00:06:28.000> change<00:06:28.570> the<00:06:28.720> computer
