00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.899
 all youtube and how come to one 

00:00:01.469 --> 00:00:05.850
 new people miserable video and because you all 

00:00:03.899 --> 00:00:07.740
 no schnaps noses are you? 

00:00:05.850 --> 00:00:10.620
 again for a drink and that 

00:00:07.740 --> 00:00:13.559
 this time mountain view and code red 

00:00:10.620 --> 00:00:14.750
 and woe it asks now what is it 

00:00:13.559 --> 00:00:16.980
 mountain view 

00:00:14.750 --> 00:00:18.779
 There is always mountain view here 

00:00:16.980 --> 00:00:20.369
 once again sporadically in germany 

00:00:18.779 --> 00:00:22.740
 long time I only believe in bp or 

00:00:20.369 --> 00:00:24.810
 Aral gas stations it is still two of 

00:00:22.740 --> 00:00:26.970
 The variety was always in 

00:00:24.810 --> 00:00:28.710
 small supermarkets and and and it is 

00:00:26.970 --> 00:00:30.779
 not common but this 

00:00:28.710 --> 00:00:31.740
 At least this half-liter bottle is there 

00:00:30.779 --> 00:00:34.050
 from time to time 

00:00:31.740 --> 00:00:36.390
 I personally love the certificate is 

00:00:34.050 --> 00:00:40.170
 totally out is definitely among my 

00:00:36.390 --> 00:00:41.660
 top 3 soft drinks depending on how I like 

00:00:40.170 --> 00:00:44.489
 count mountain view is easy for me 

00:00:41.660 --> 00:00:47.340
 no matter 

00:00:44.489 --> 00:00:48.960
 but I drink half liter bottle 

00:00:47.340 --> 00:00:50.520
 rather out of the box and then mostly 

00:00:48.960 --> 00:00:53.129
 Pretty much from a dealer in Holland 

00:00:50.520 --> 00:00:54.629
 cheap to relate but that's why it should 

00:00:53.129 --> 00:00:57.539
 Do not go because I will 

00:00:54.629 --> 00:00:58.739
 mountain view do not test this here 

00:00:57.539 --> 00:01:00.149
 I do not need that at all 

00:00:58.739 --> 00:01:02.190
 just as if one is going and now 

00:01:00.149 --> 00:01:03.989
 says pepsi cola or coca cola tester 

00:01:02.190 --> 00:01:06.270
 but we do not care about it 

00:01:03.989 --> 00:01:10.140
 but this time it's about mountain 

00:01:06.270 --> 00:01:11.460
 view cottret difference is ever 

00:01:10.140 --> 00:01:13.350
 Of course I have here simply times the 

00:01:11.460 --> 00:01:16.650
 bottles you see it on the packaging 

00:01:13.350 --> 00:01:17.880
 it is slightly chilled and a i had 

00:01:16.650 --> 00:01:19.890
 but last summer and it does 

00:01:17.880 --> 00:01:22.110
 just fine so that we too in the 

00:01:19.890 --> 00:01:24.330
 that's why they have comparisons here 

00:01:22.110 --> 00:01:27.330
 normal mountain view as I said 

00:01:24.330 --> 00:01:28.820
 rather the chip can be awesome right now 

00:01:27.330 --> 00:01:33.750
 everything wet and slippery 

00:01:28.820 --> 00:01:35.040
 So this typical mountain you smell 

00:01:33.750 --> 00:01:36.210
 I'm sorry I can taste it now 

00:01:35.040 --> 00:01:38.490
 Also do not describe mountain news 

00:01:36.210 --> 00:01:41.040
 simply describes whois verso s ab 

00:01:38.490 --> 00:01:43.890
 you pepsi or describe macula like that 

00:01:41.040 --> 00:01:45.570
 sharp test there is of course the 

00:01:43.890 --> 00:01:47.579
 big disappointment mountain view 

00:01:45.570 --> 00:01:50.340
 does not shine as nice as here 

00:01:47.579 --> 00:01:54.619
 but of course it's ticking green 

00:01:50.340 --> 00:01:54.619
 but rather otherwise pale yellowish pure 

00:01:56.690 --> 00:02:02.210
 I just drink as because of the 

00:01:58.400 --> 00:02:06.500
 reference value because now comes mountain 

00:02:02.210 --> 00:02:09.020
 view red you can imagine it is 

00:02:06.500 --> 00:02:12.980
 simply mountain youth something rotim in it 

00:02:09.020 --> 00:02:15.170
 and the question is now something red there 

00:02:12.980 --> 00:02:20.330
 in it is and you test the first smell 

00:02:15.170 --> 00:02:22.430
 says there is church in there so even 

00:02:20.330 --> 00:02:24.260
 no question it is mountain view with 

00:02:22.430 --> 00:02:26.120
 Cherry flavor would probably have 

00:02:24.260 --> 00:02:29.330
 also mountain view cherry call 

00:02:26.120 --> 00:02:31.750
 or something but or mountain view dr 

00:02:29.330 --> 00:02:34.160
 pepper but no matter 

00:02:31.750 --> 00:02:40.120
 we will not disappoint in color 

00:02:34.160 --> 00:02:41.870
 Red is slightly red and does not look the same 

00:02:40.120 --> 00:02:44.240
 taste test is about it now 

00:02:41.870 --> 00:02:45.560
 from where so at doses I drink 

00:02:44.240 --> 00:02:47.600
 yes really out of the box but at one 

00:02:45.560 --> 00:02:49.130
 bottle that I have to really give me 

00:02:47.600 --> 00:02:56.320
 I do not care about that now I can 

00:02:49.130 --> 00:03:00.850
 drink from the glass and tells you yes 

00:02:56.320 --> 00:03:00.850
 many artificial flavors 

00:03:04.010 --> 00:03:10.520
 You can feel so easily in the 

00:03:06.600 --> 00:03:10.520
 you still taste the taste 

00:03:10.760 --> 00:03:21.050
 now you get used to it 

00:03:14.570 --> 00:03:25.200
 hello it tastes a bit like 

00:03:21.050 --> 00:03:27.210
 these 30 40 or 30 cents or 10 cents 

00:03:25.200 --> 00:03:28.770
 water ice things out of the bag you know 

00:03:27.210 --> 00:03:30.150
 already the push with the plastic 

00:03:28.770 --> 00:03:32.820
 how to have one with the cells 

00:03:30.150 --> 00:03:34.260
 the paper or elsewhere spits and 

00:03:32.820 --> 00:03:36.060
 then so sleeps this water ice 

00:03:34.260 --> 00:03:38.580
 dinger to the high bridge if you as the 

00:03:36.060 --> 00:03:40.140
 kills sort and the whole ice or 

00:03:38.580 --> 00:03:42.240
 at least half- fed and then 

00:03:40.140 --> 00:03:44.760
 is still melting schmidt to melt 

00:03:42.240 --> 00:03:48.030
 bring and then the last sap 

00:03:44.760 --> 00:03:49.500
 then get out so therefore not air probably 

00:03:48.030 --> 00:03:54.390
 only the concentrate but if that too 

00:03:49.500 --> 00:03:57.300
 whole ice is melted into this 

00:03:54.390 --> 00:03:59.430
 It's all about the taste 

00:03:57.300 --> 00:04:03.120
 I have a nice change now 

00:03:59.430 --> 00:04:03.900
 but not really buy in 

00:04:03.120 --> 00:04:06.210
 order too 

00:04:03.900 --> 00:04:09.900
 red who stands on church and that one 

00:04:06.210 --> 00:04:12.120
 I would like to have another one 

00:04:09.900 --> 00:04:14.100
 Of course, nothing about the original and 

00:04:12.120 --> 00:04:17.850
 that should have been here now 

00:04:14.100 --> 00:04:20.430
 mountain view code red test yes you can 

00:04:17.850 --> 00:04:22.020
 But you do not have to try it much 

00:04:20.430 --> 00:04:23.520
 more important if you do not have it yet 

00:04:22.020 --> 00:04:27.000
 it should have never been 

00:04:23.520 --> 00:04:28.650
 original mountain youth so that's it in 

00:04:27.000 --> 00:04:30.150
 Thanks for the video at portland 

00:04:28.650 --> 00:04:31.920
 next time I try something without 

00:04:30.150 --> 00:04:34.880
 get drinks and until the 

00:04:31.920 --> 00:04:34.880
 next time bye
