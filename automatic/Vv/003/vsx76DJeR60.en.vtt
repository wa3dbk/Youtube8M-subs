about<00:02:31.790> that<00:02:32.030> I<00:02:32.090> think<00:02:32.270> might<00:02:32.510> be<00:02:32.540> end<00:02:32.840> up<00:02:32.959> being

00:02:33.130 --> 00:02:33.140 
about that I think might be end up being

00:02:33.140 --> 00:02:35.530 
about that I think might be end up being
a<00:02:33.200> little<00:02:33.350> shorter<00:02:34.010> but<00:02:34.190> a<00:02:34.520> lot<00:02:35.209> to<00:02:35.300> play<00:02:35.420> with
