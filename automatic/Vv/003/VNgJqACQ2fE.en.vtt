this<00:00:52.440> really<00:00:52.680> cool<00:00:52.860> riff<00:00:53.250> it's<00:00:53.730> an

00:00:53.840 --> 00:00:53.850 
this really cool riff it's an

00:00:53.850 --> 00:00:55.640 
this really cool riff it's an
interesting<00:00:54.120> way<00:00:54.450> to<00:00:54.480> open<00:00:54.840> up<00:00:54.960> the<00:00:55.110> album<00:00:55.440> and

00:00:55.640 --> 00:00:55.650 
interesting way to open up the album and

00:00:55.650 --> 00:00:57.830 
interesting way to open up the album and
I<00:00:55.860> felt<00:00:56.100> it<00:00:56.280> was<00:00:56.520> probably<00:00:57.030> the<00:00:57.180> best<00:00:57.420> song<00:00:57.630> on

00:00:57.830 --> 00:00:57.840 
I felt it was probably the best song on

00:00:57.840 --> 00:00:59.330 
I felt it was probably the best song on
the<00:00:57.960> album<00:00:57.990> to<00:00:58.410> be<00:00:58.440> honest<00:00:58.860> it's<00:00:59.220> a<00:00:59.310> little

00:00:59.330 --> 00:00:59.340 
the album to be honest it's a little

00:00:59.340 --> 00:01:00.890 
the album to be honest it's a little
different<00:00:59.760> and<00:01:00.030> it<00:01:00.150> really<00:01:00.300> stands<00:01:00.570> out<00:01:00.720> on

00:01:00.890 --> 00:01:00.900 
different and it really stands out on

00:01:00.900 --> 00:01:03.020 
different and it really stands out on
its<00:01:01.050> own<00:01:01.200> the<00:01:01.710> first<00:01:01.950> single<00:01:02.310> off<00:01:02.400> the<00:01:02.460> ohm<00:01:02.700> is

00:01:03.020 --> 00:01:03.030 
its own the first single off the ohm is

00:01:03.030 --> 00:01:05.060 
its own the first single off the ohm is
a<00:01:03.060> song<00:01:03.360> called<00:01:03.630> days<00:01:04.110> are<00:01:04.409> forgotten<00:01:04.650> and

00:01:05.060 --> 00:01:05.070 
a song called days are forgotten and

00:01:05.070 --> 00:01:06.830 
a song called days are forgotten and
when<00:01:05.369> I<00:01:05.400> first<00:01:05.700> heard<00:01:05.939> it<00:01:06.090> I<00:01:06.150> immediately

00:01:06.830 --> 00:01:06.840 
when I first heard it I immediately

00:01:06.840 --> 00:01:09.140 
when I first heard it I immediately
thought<00:01:07.290> of<00:01:07.350> blur<00:01:07.740> it<00:01:08.280> really<00:01:08.550> reminded<00:01:09.000> me<00:01:09.120> of

00:01:09.140 --> 00:01:09.150 
thought of blur it really reminded me of

00:01:09.150 --> 00:01:11.360 
thought of blur it really reminded me of
that<00:01:09.330> ninety<00:01:10.020> sort<00:01:10.350> of<00:01:10.440> Britpop<00:01:10.950> type<00:01:11.220> of

00:01:11.360 --> 00:01:11.370 
that ninety sort of Britpop type of

00:01:11.370 --> 00:01:13.610 
that ninety sort of Britpop type of
thing<00:01:11.550> which<00:01:12.480> is<00:01:12.630> cool<00:01:12.810> because<00:01:12.990> I'm<00:01:13.320> a<00:01:13.350> big

00:01:13.610 --> 00:01:13.620 
thing which is cool because I'm a big

00:01:13.620 --> 00:01:15.740 
thing which is cool because I'm a big
fan<00:01:13.830> of<00:01:13.860> that<00:01:14.130> and<00:01:14.400> obviously<00:01:15.060> they're<00:01:15.600> from

00:01:15.740 --> 00:01:15.750 
fan of that and obviously they're from

00:01:15.750 --> 00:01:17.360 
fan of that and obviously they're from
England<00:01:16.020> so<00:01:16.350> they<00:01:16.470> can<00:01:16.650> definitely<00:01:17.070> pull<00:01:17.280> it

00:01:17.360 --> 00:01:17.370 
England so they can definitely pull it

00:01:17.370 --> 00:01:19.130 
England so they can definitely pull it
off<00:01:17.550> but<00:01:17.820> you<00:01:18.060> really<00:01:18.300> do<00:01:18.479> hear<00:01:18.720> the<00:01:18.870> blur

00:01:19.130 --> 00:01:19.140 
off but you really do hear the blur

00:01:19.140 --> 00:01:21.110 
off but you really do hear the blur
influence<00:01:19.740> in<00:01:19.920> this<00:01:20.070> song<00:01:20.340> but<00:01:20.729> they<00:01:20.850> really

00:01:21.110 --> 00:01:21.120 
influence in this song but they really

00:01:21.120 --> 00:01:22.820 
influence in this song but they really
do<00:01:21.240> make<00:01:21.420> it<00:01:21.630> their<00:01:21.780> own<00:01:21.810> and<00:01:21.930> put<00:01:22.470> sort<00:01:22.650> of<00:01:22.710> put

00:01:22.820 --> 00:01:22.830 
do make it their own and put sort of put

00:01:22.830 --> 00:01:24.649 
do make it their own and put sort of put
their<00:01:22.950> own<00:01:22.979> spin<00:01:23.400> on<00:01:23.460> it<00:01:23.670> the<00:01:24.240> title<00:01:24.540> track

their own spin on it the title track

00:01:24.659 --> 00:01:26.750 
their own spin on it the title track
Velociraptor<00:01:25.560> has<00:01:25.800> some<00:01:25.979> more<00:01:26.130> electronic

00:01:26.750 --> 00:01:26.760 
Velociraptor has some more electronic

00:01:26.760 --> 00:01:29.120 
Velociraptor has some more electronic
elements<00:01:27.030> in<00:01:27.360> it<00:01:27.390> the<00:01:28.140> drums<00:01:28.500> are<00:01:28.650> programmed

00:01:29.120 --> 00:01:29.130 
elements in it the drums are programmed

00:01:29.130 --> 00:01:31.219 
elements in it the drums are programmed
in<00:01:29.400> and<00:01:29.729> it<00:01:29.880> sort<00:01:30.120> of<00:01:30.180> relies<00:01:30.540> heavily<00:01:30.570> on<00:01:30.990> the

00:01:31.219 --> 00:01:31.229 
in and it sort of relies heavily on the

00:01:31.229 --> 00:01:34.070 
in and it sort of relies heavily on the
synthesizer<00:01:31.799> I<00:01:32.270> didn't<00:01:33.270> really<00:01:33.420> work<00:01:33.720> for<00:01:33.750> me

00:01:34.070 --> 00:01:34.080 
synthesizer I didn't really work for me

00:01:34.080 --> 00:01:36.110 
synthesizer I didn't really work for me
this<00:01:34.740> was<00:01:34.890> probably<00:01:35.190> my<00:01:35.340> least<00:01:35.520> favorite<00:01:35.940> song

00:01:36.110 --> 00:01:36.120 
this was probably my least favorite song

00:01:36.120 --> 00:01:38.660 
this was probably my least favorite song
on<00:01:36.299> the<00:01:36.479> album<00:01:36.560> I<00:01:37.560> really<00:01:38.130> didn't<00:01:38.340> like<00:01:38.460> this

00:01:38.660 --> 00:01:38.670 
on the album I really didn't like this

00:01:38.670 --> 00:01:41.030 
on the album I really didn't like this
one<00:01:38.729> actually<00:01:39.150> I<00:01:39.510> hear<00:01:39.960> voices<00:01:40.170> as<00:01:40.650> a<00:01:40.710> song

00:01:41.030 --> 00:01:41.040 
one actually I hear voices as a song

00:01:41.040 --> 00:01:43.850 
one actually I hear voices as a song
that's<00:01:41.190> really<00:01:41.490> similar<00:01:41.729> to<00:01:42.390> a<00:01:42.860> Velociraptor

00:01:43.850 --> 00:01:43.860 
that's really similar to a Velociraptor

00:01:43.860 --> 00:01:46.280 
that's really similar to a Velociraptor
it<00:01:44.070> really<00:01:44.460> relies<00:01:45.360> heavily<00:01:45.390> again<00:01:46.020> on<00:01:46.170> the

00:01:46.280 --> 00:01:46.290 
it really relies heavily again on the

00:01:46.290 --> 00:01:47.930 
it really relies heavily again on the
synthesizer<00:01:46.860> and<00:01:47.220> it<00:01:47.430> really<00:01:47.580> sounds<00:01:47.880> like

00:01:47.930 --> 00:01:47.940 
synthesizer and it really sounds like

00:01:47.940 --> 00:01:49.850 
synthesizer and it really sounds like
something<00:01:48.299> you<00:01:48.360> would<00:01:48.479> hear<00:01:48.750> in<00:01:49.380> the<00:01:49.500> mid<00:01:49.650> 80s

00:01:49.850 --> 00:01:49.860 
something you would hear in the mid 80s

00:01:49.860 --> 00:01:52.010 
something you would hear in the mid 80s
on<00:01:50.190> the<00:01:50.310> radio<00:01:50.670> which<00:01:51.060> I'm<00:01:51.240> not<00:01:51.420> a<00:01:51.479> big<00:01:51.750> fan<00:01:51.780> of

00:01:52.010 --> 00:01:52.020 
on the radio which I'm not a big fan of

00:01:52.020 --> 00:01:54.230 
on the radio which I'm not a big fan of
so<00:01:52.500> again<00:01:52.860> this<00:01:53.100> song<00:01:53.400> really<00:01:53.610> just<00:01:53.940> didn't

00:01:54.230 --> 00:01:54.240 
so again this song really just didn't

00:01:54.240 --> 00:01:56.660 
so again this song really just didn't
work<00:01:54.360> for<00:01:54.420> me<00:01:54.630> the<00:01:55.229> song<00:01:55.470> rewired<00:01:56.010> was<00:01:56.640> a

00:01:56.660 --> 00:01:56.670 
work for me the song rewired was a

00:01:56.670 --> 00:01:58.039 
work for me the song rewired was a
little<00:01:56.970> better<00:01:57.060> because<00:01:57.299> it<00:01:57.479> actually<00:01:57.659> had

00:01:58.039 --> 00:01:58.049 
little better because it actually had

00:01:58.049 --> 00:02:01.460 
little better because it actually had
some<00:01:58.260> organic<00:01:58.830> instruments<00:02:00.140> although<00:02:01.140> it<00:02:01.320> was

00:02:01.460 --> 00:02:01.470 
some organic instruments although it was

00:02:01.470 --> 00:02:03.050 
some organic instruments although it was
mixed<00:02:01.770> in<00:02:01.860> with<00:02:02.040> the<00:02:02.100> synthesizer<00:02:02.760> in<00:02:03.000> the

00:02:03.050 --> 00:02:03.060 
mixed in with the synthesizer in the

00:02:03.060 --> 00:02:05.539 
mixed in with the synthesizer in the
background<00:02:03.570> the<00:02:04.470> organic<00:02:04.799> instruments<00:02:05.400> were

00:02:05.539 --> 00:02:05.549 
background the organic instruments were

00:02:05.549 --> 00:02:07.130 
background the organic instruments were
really<00:02:05.820> the<00:02:05.970> main<00:02:06.150> thing<00:02:06.210> going<00:02:06.750> on<00:02:06.869> in<00:02:07.049> the

00:02:07.130 --> 00:02:07.140 
really the main thing going on in the

00:02:07.140 --> 00:02:08.869 
really the main thing going on in the
song<00:02:07.380> was<00:02:07.650> a<00:02:07.770> little<00:02:07.950> more<00:02:08.069> rock<00:02:08.280> bass<00:02:08.549> rather

00:02:08.869 --> 00:02:08.879 
song was a little more rock bass rather

00:02:08.879 --> 00:02:11.180 
song was a little more rock bass rather
than<00:02:09.090> the<00:02:09.299> electronic<00:02:10.110> sort<00:02:10.470> of<00:02:10.530> experimental

00:02:11.180 --> 00:02:11.190 
than the electronic sort of experimental

00:02:11.190 --> 00:02:12.860 
than the electronic sort of experimental
stuff<00:02:11.370> they<00:02:11.550> were<00:02:11.610> doing<00:02:11.700> like<00:02:12.330> I<00:02:12.360> said<00:02:12.660> the

00:02:12.860 --> 00:02:12.870 
stuff they were doing like I said the

00:02:12.870 --> 00:02:14.510 
stuff they were doing like I said the
main<00:02:13.110> instruments<00:02:13.680> were

00:02:14.510 --> 00:02:14.520 
main instruments were

00:02:14.520 --> 00:02:16.580 
main instruments were
more<00:02:14.670> organic<00:02:15.240> instruments<00:02:15.750> and<00:02:15.870> the

00:02:16.580 --> 00:02:16.590 
more organic instruments and the

00:02:16.590 --> 00:02:18.530 
more organic instruments and the
synthesizer<00:02:17.160> actually<00:02:17.760> does<00:02:17.970> complement

00:02:18.530 --> 00:02:18.540 
synthesizer actually does complement

00:02:18.540 --> 00:02:20.720 
synthesizer actually does complement
this<00:02:18.750> really<00:02:19.110> well<00:02:19.290> it<00:02:19.560> does<00:02:19.800> work<00:02:20.100> in<00:02:20.400> this

00:02:20.720 --> 00:02:20.730 
this really well it does work in this

00:02:20.730 --> 00:02:22.670 
this really well it does work in this
song<00:02:21.000> and<00:02:21.270> then<00:02:21.690> the<00:02:21.810> album<00:02:22.080> closes<00:02:22.530> with<00:02:22.650> a

00:02:22.670 --> 00:02:22.680 
song and then the album closes with a

00:02:22.680 --> 00:02:25.190 
song and then the album closes with a
song<00:02:22.950> called<00:02:23.190> neon<00:02:23.610> noon<00:02:23.970> which<00:02:24.390> is<00:02:24.690> a<00:02:24.750> slower

00:02:25.190 --> 00:02:25.200 
song called neon noon which is a slower

00:02:25.200 --> 00:02:28.450 
song called neon noon which is a slower
song<00:02:25.500> it's<00:02:25.890> sort<00:02:26.100> of<00:02:26.160> a<00:02:26.220> ballot<00:02:26.580> it's<00:02:27.480> got<00:02:27.720> that

00:02:28.450 --> 00:02:28.460 
song it's sort of a ballot it's got that

00:02:28.460 --> 00:02:31.640 
song it's sort of a ballot it's got that
same<00:02:29.460> synthesizer<00:02:30.270> that<00:02:30.690> heard<00:02:31.350> throughout

00:02:31.640 --> 00:02:31.650 
same synthesizer that heard throughout

00:02:31.650 --> 00:02:32.990 
same synthesizer that heard throughout
the<00:02:31.830> album<00:02:31.950> but<00:02:32.280> it's<00:02:32.460> mixed<00:02:32.760> with<00:02:32.790> an

00:02:32.990 --> 00:02:33.000 
the album but it's mixed with an

00:02:33.000 --> 00:02:34.910 
the album but it's mixed with an
acoustic<00:02:33.450> guitar<00:02:33.480> and<00:02:33.960> actually<00:02:34.650> sounds

00:02:34.910 --> 00:02:34.920 
acoustic guitar and actually sounds

00:02:34.920 --> 00:02:36.620 
acoustic guitar and actually sounds
quite<00:02:35.070> beautiful<00:02:35.640> and<00:02:35.880> it's<00:02:36.090> a<00:02:36.210> really<00:02:36.420> nice

00:02:36.620 --> 00:02:36.630 
quite beautiful and it's a really nice

00:02:36.630 --> 00:02:38.150 
quite beautiful and it's a really nice
way<00:02:36.870> to<00:02:36.930> close<00:02:37.140> the<00:02:37.350> album<00:02:37.620> it's<00:02:37.800> always<00:02:38.130> a

00:02:38.150 --> 00:02:38.160 
way to close the album it's always a

00:02:38.160 --> 00:02:40.610 
way to close the album it's always a
good<00:02:38.340> idea<00:02:38.400> to<00:02:38.730> close<00:02:39.420> the<00:02:39.600> album<00:02:39.930> on<00:02:40.110> a<00:02:40.170> slower

00:02:40.610 --> 00:02:40.620 
good idea to close the album on a slower

00:02:40.620 --> 00:02:43.370 
good idea to close the album on a slower
song<00:02:40.920> and<00:02:41.190> they<00:02:42.150> managed<00:02:42.690> to<00:02:42.840> pull<00:02:43.050> this<00:02:43.200> off

00:02:43.370 --> 00:02:43.380 
song and they managed to pull this off

00:02:43.380 --> 00:02:45.170 
song and they managed to pull this off
really<00:02:43.590> well<00:02:43.710> production-wise<00:02:44.490> this<00:02:44.850> album

00:02:45.170 --> 00:02:45.180 
really well production-wise this album

00:02:45.180 --> 00:02:46.670 
really well production-wise this album
is<00:02:45.270> pretty<00:02:45.360> good<00:02:45.720> all<00:02:45.990> the<00:02:46.020> instruments<00:02:46.590> are

00:02:46.670 --> 00:02:46.680 
is pretty good all the instruments are

00:02:46.680 --> 00:02:49.160 
is pretty good all the instruments are
coming<00:02:46.980> in<00:02:47.070> clear<00:02:47.430> and<00:02:47.730> you<00:02:48.420> know<00:02:48.540> it's<00:02:48.870> mixed

00:02:49.160 --> 00:02:49.170 
coming in clear and you know it's mixed

00:02:49.170 --> 00:02:50.870 
coming in clear and you know it's mixed
really<00:02:49.350> well<00:02:49.500> everything's<00:02:50.160> very<00:02:50.340> present

00:02:50.870 --> 00:02:50.880 
really well everything's very present

00:02:50.880 --> 00:02:52.430 
really well everything's very present
you<00:02:51.030> can<00:02:51.210> hear<00:02:51.390> everything<00:02:51.660> that's<00:02:51.930> going<00:02:52.050> on

00:02:52.430 --> 00:02:52.440 
you can hear everything that's going on

00:02:52.440 --> 00:02:54.140 
you can hear everything that's going on
and<00:02:52.890> you<00:02:52.980> can<00:02:53.130> tell<00:02:53.310> that<00:02:53.340> they<00:02:53.550> really<00:02:53.580> sort

00:02:54.140 --> 00:02:54.150 
and you can tell that they really sort

00:02:54.150 --> 00:02:55.850 
and you can tell that they really sort
of<00:02:54.210> spent<00:02:54.420> a<00:02:54.510> lot<00:02:54.660> of<00:02:54.690> time<00:02:54.840> on<00:02:55.200> it<00:02:55.230> I<00:02:55.530> would

00:02:55.850 --> 00:02:55.860 
of spent a lot of time on it I would

00:02:55.860 --> 00:02:57.380 
of spent a lot of time on it I would
have<00:02:55.980> touched<00:02:56.130> things<00:02:56.490> up<00:02:56.640> a<00:02:56.760> little<00:02:56.910> bit<00:02:57.060> here

00:02:57.380 --> 00:02:57.390 
have touched things up a little bit here

00:02:57.390 --> 00:02:59.450 
have touched things up a little bit here
and<00:02:57.480> there<00:02:57.570> but<00:02:57.690> overall<00:02:58.050> it<00:02:58.530> was<00:02:58.680> pretty<00:02:58.710> well

00:02:59.450 --> 00:02:59.460 
and there but overall it was pretty well

00:02:59.460 --> 00:03:01.430 
and there but overall it was pretty well
done<00:02:59.490> so<00:03:00.030> this<00:03:00.180> album<00:03:00.480> wasn't<00:03:00.660> terrible<00:03:01.260> it

00:03:01.430 --> 00:03:01.440 
done so this album wasn't terrible it

00:03:01.440 --> 00:03:02.870 
done so this album wasn't terrible it
wasn't<00:03:01.950> the<00:03:02.010> best<00:03:02.160> thing<00:03:02.370> I've<00:03:02.520> ever<00:03:02.580> heard

00:03:02.870 --> 00:03:02.880 
wasn't the best thing I've ever heard

00:03:02.880 --> 00:03:05.600 
wasn't the best thing I've ever heard
but<00:03:03.270> it<00:03:03.570> wasn't<00:03:03.930> terrible<00:03:04.110> either<00:03:04.560> I<00:03:04.950> had<00:03:05.430> some

00:03:05.600 --> 00:03:05.610 
but it wasn't terrible either I had some

00:03:05.610 --> 00:03:07.760 
but it wasn't terrible either I had some
good<00:03:05.760> songs<00:03:06.030> on<00:03:06.330> it<00:03:06.360> um<00:03:06.990> some<00:03:07.410> of<00:03:07.500> the<00:03:07.560> songs

00:03:07.760 --> 00:03:07.770 
good songs on it um some of the songs

00:03:07.770 --> 00:03:09.800 
good songs on it um some of the songs
were<00:03:08.010> a<00:03:08.040> little<00:03:08.430> I<00:03:08.910> could<00:03:09.240> have<00:03:09.330> skipped<00:03:09.570> them

00:03:09.800 --> 00:03:09.810 
were a little I could have skipped them

00:03:09.810 --> 00:03:12.080 
were a little I could have skipped them
like<00:03:10.680> I<00:03:10.770> said<00:03:10.950> the<00:03:11.070> more<00:03:11.280> electronic<00:03:11.910> bass

00:03:12.080 --> 00:03:12.090 
like I said the more electronic bass

00:03:12.090 --> 00:03:13.940 
like I said the more electronic bass
ones<00:03:12.390> so<00:03:12.660> I'm<00:03:12.900> gonna<00:03:12.990> give<00:03:13.230> it<00:03:13.320> a<00:03:13.410> seven<00:03:13.620> out<00:03:13.890> of
