hello and welcome to another tutorial by
monster<00:00:32.980> projects<00:00:33.460> today<00:00:34.180> we're<00:00:34.450> going<00:00:34.600> to<00:00:34.720> be

00:00:34.799 --> 00:00:34.809 
monster projects today we're going to be

00:00:34.809 --> 00:00:38.040 
monster projects today we're going to be
looking<00:00:35.110> at<00:00:35.400> compiling<00:00:36.400> Maps<00:00:37.210> to<00:00:37.660> build<00:00:37.870> to

00:00:38.040 --> 00:00:38.050 
looking at compiling Maps to build to

00:00:38.050 --> 00:00:41.910 
looking at compiling Maps to build to
use<00:00:38.230> them<00:00:38.530> in<00:00:38.770> hammer<00:00:39.550> editor<00:00:39.720> basically<00:00:40.920> this

00:00:41.910 --> 00:00:41.920 
use them in hammer editor basically this

00:00:41.920 --> 00:00:45.600 
use them in hammer editor basically this
allows<00:00:42.250> you<00:00:42.700> to<00:00:42.730> turn<00:00:43.300> a<00:00:43.629> compiled<00:00:44.559> map<00:00:44.800> a<00:00:45.010> DSP

00:00:45.600 --> 00:00:45.610 
allows you to turn a compiled map a DSP

00:00:45.610 --> 00:00:49.290 
allows you to turn a compiled map a DSP
file<00:00:46.110> into<00:00:47.110> a<00:00:47.440> dot<00:00:47.949> VMF<00:00:48.460> file<00:00:48.730> which<00:00:49.120> you<00:00:49.150> can

00:00:49.290 --> 00:00:49.300 
file into a dot VMF file which you can

00:00:49.300 --> 00:00:52.439 
file into a dot VMF file which you can
then<00:00:49.480> edit<00:00:49.870> in<00:00:50.440> hammer<00:00:51.010> editor<00:00:51.190> now<00:00:51.940> some<00:00:52.239> maps

00:00:52.439 --> 00:00:52.449 
then edit in hammer editor now some maps

00:00:52.449 --> 00:00:55.229 
then edit in hammer editor now some maps
I<00:00:52.629> won't<00:00:52.839> allow<00:00:53.199> you<00:00:53.260> to<00:00:54.129> decompile<00:00:55.030> its

00:00:55.229 --> 00:00:55.239 
I won't allow you to decompile its

00:00:55.239 --> 00:00:57.360 
I won't allow you to decompile its
abilities<00:00:55.540> in<00:00:55.720> hammer<00:00:55.930> editor<00:00:56.019> because<00:00:56.410> the

00:00:57.360 --> 00:00:57.370 
abilities in hammer editor because the

00:00:57.370 --> 00:01:00.660 
abilities in hammer editor because the
Creator<00:00:58.000> doesn't<00:00:58.900> want<00:00:59.019> you<00:00:59.140> to<00:00:59.430> okay<00:01:00.430> so<00:01:00.489> to

00:01:00.660 --> 00:01:00.670 
Creator doesn't want you to okay so to

is just click browse find the map that
you<00:01:26.350> want<00:01:26.560> to<00:01:26.830> you<00:01:27.550> compile<00:01:27.940> I've<00:01:28.660> got<00:01:28.840> two

00:01:29.010 --> 00:01:29.020 
you want to you compile I've got two

00:01:29.020 --> 00:01:30.600 
you want to you compile I've got two
here<00:01:29.229> I've<00:01:29.350> got<00:01:29.500> a<00:01:29.530> clean<00:01:29.800> forty<00:01:30.220> one<00:01:30.369> and<00:01:30.399> one

I've made I will first look at this team
for<00:01:32.860> GT<00:01:33.100> one<00:01:33.310> there's<00:01:33.490> a<00:01:33.520> difference<00:01:33.909> between

00:01:34.050 --> 00:01:34.060 
for GT one there's a difference between

00:01:34.060 --> 00:01:36.600 
for GT one there's a difference between
the<00:01:34.420> two<00:01:34.799> okay<00:01:35.799> once<00:01:35.979> you've<00:01:36.130> selected<00:01:36.280> it

00:01:36.600 --> 00:01:36.610 
the two okay once you've selected it

00:01:36.610 --> 00:01:39.359 
the two okay once you've selected it
here<00:01:37.030> and<00:01:37.180> the<00:01:37.780> pass<00:01:37.960> up<00:01:38.229> there<00:01:38.259> just<00:01:39.130> click

00:01:39.359 --> 00:01:39.369 
here and the pass up there just click

00:01:39.369 --> 00:01:44.069 
here and the pass up there just click
decompile<00:01:40.890> it'll<00:01:41.890> do<00:01:41.979> a<00:01:42.009> load<00:01:42.220> of<00:01:42.840> dots<00:01:43.840> and

00:01:44.069 --> 00:01:44.079 
decompile it'll do a load of dots and

00:01:44.079 --> 00:01:48.539 
decompile it'll do a load of dots and
stuff<00:01:44.380> and<00:01:44.619> text<00:01:45.009> displacement<00:01:45.640> soon<00:01:47.549> okay

00:01:48.539 --> 00:01:48.549 
stuff and text displacement soon okay

00:01:48.549 --> 00:01:51.350 
stuff and text displacement soon okay
and<00:01:48.759> done<00:01:49.030> in<00:01:49.270> seven<00:01:49.570> point<00:01:49.780> nine<00:01:49.810> seconds<00:01:50.380> so

00:01:51.350 --> 00:01:51.360 
and done in seven point nine seconds so

00:01:51.360 --> 00:01:54.630 
and done in seven point nine seconds so
we've<00:01:52.360> actually<00:01:52.479> got<00:01:52.869> that<00:01:53.130> here<00:01:54.130> now<00:01:54.369> to

00:01:54.630 --> 00:01:54.640 
we've actually got that here now to

00:01:54.640 --> 00:01:56.910 
we've actually got that here now to
bring<00:01:54.790> the<00:01:54.909> Teva<00:01:55.119> and<00:01:55.420> you<00:01:56.200> can<00:01:56.380> see<00:01:56.590> that

00:01:56.910 --> 00:01:56.920 
bring the Teva and you can see that

00:01:56.920 --> 00:01:59.100 
bring the Teva and you can see that
that's<00:01:57.100> now<00:01:57.369> over<00:01:57.939> there<00:01:58.119> we've<00:01:58.659> set<00:01:58.810> back<00:01:58.960> to

00:01:59.100 --> 00:01:59.110 
that's now over there we've set back to

00:01:59.110 --> 00:02:02.429 
that's now over there we've set back to
that<00:01:59.229> monitor<00:01:59.619> okay<00:02:00.460> so<00:02:00.960> now<00:02:01.960> I<00:02:02.229> will<00:02:02.409> just

00:02:02.429 --> 00:02:02.439 
that monitor okay so now I will just

00:02:02.439 --> 00:02:05.670 
that monitor okay so now I will just
close<00:02:02.829> that<00:02:02.860> start<00:02:03.790> from<00:02:03.939> fresh<00:02:04.119> if<00:02:05.049> we<00:02:05.380> choose

00:02:05.670 --> 00:02:05.680 
close that start from fresh if we choose

00:02:05.680 --> 00:02:11.640 
close that start from fresh if we choose
the<00:02:05.979> other<00:02:06.420> map<00:02:07.829> it<00:02:08.829> was<00:02:08.979> in<00:02:09.130> that<00:02:09.310> folder<00:02:10.650> this

00:02:11.640 --> 00:02:11.650 
the other map it was in that folder this

00:02:11.650 --> 00:02:14.640 
the other map it was in that folder this
one<00:02:11.890> that<00:02:12.010> I<00:02:12.130> made<00:02:13.230> difference<00:02:14.230> between<00:02:14.500> these

00:02:14.640 --> 00:02:14.650 
one that I made difference between these

00:02:14.650 --> 00:02:18.509 
one that I made difference between these
two<00:02:14.980> is<00:02:15.220> the<00:02:15.810> OSD<00:02:16.810> compile<00:02:17.140> now<00:02:17.370> it'll<00:02:18.370> say

00:02:18.509 --> 00:02:18.519 
two is the OSD compile now it'll say

00:02:18.519 --> 00:02:21.150 
two is the OSD compile now it'll say
this<00:02:18.730> map<00:02:18.970> is<00:02:19.209> rent<00:02:20.110> is<00:02:20.380> protected<00:02:20.950> from

00:02:21.150 --> 00:02:21.160 
this map is rent is protected from

00:02:21.160 --> 00:02:24.449 
this map is rent is protected from
decompiling<00:02:22.049> so<00:02:23.049> basically<00:02:23.530> like<00:02:23.709> said<00:02:24.130> this

00:02:24.449 --> 00:02:24.459 
decompiling so basically like said this

00:02:24.459 --> 00:02:28.890 
decompiling so basically like said this
means<00:02:24.970> I've<00:02:25.269> cold<00:02:26.200> vmx<00:02:26.860> that<00:02:27.220> not<00:02:27.760> that<00:02:28.239> no<00:02:28.720> one

00:02:28.890 --> 00:02:28.900 
means I've cold vmx that not that no one

00:02:28.900 --> 00:02:32.280 
means I've cold vmx that not that no one
can<00:02:29.079> D<00:02:29.380> compile<00:02:29.739> this<00:02:29.980> map<00:02:30.299> so<00:02:31.299> some<00:02:32.170> people

00:02:32.280 --> 00:02:32.290 
can D compile this map so some people

00:02:32.290 --> 00:02:34.530 
can D compile this map so some people
will<00:02:32.620> do<00:02:32.799> this<00:02:32.980> stop<00:02:33.459> you<00:02:33.640> taking<00:02:34.209> their<00:02:34.329> map

00:02:34.530 --> 00:02:34.540 
will do this stop you taking their map

00:02:34.540 --> 00:02:37.390 
will do this stop you taking their map
secrets<00:02:35.199> and<00:02:35.500> map<00:02:35.680> content

00:02:37.390 --> 00:02:37.400 
secrets and map content

00:02:37.400 --> 00:02:39.699 
secrets and map content
and<00:02:37.939> I<00:02:38.209> actually<00:02:38.390> had<00:02:38.780> to<00:02:38.930> do<00:02:39.049> this<00:02:39.230> in<00:02:39.439> another

00:02:39.699 --> 00:02:39.709 
and I actually had to do this in another

00:02:39.709 --> 00:02:43.869 
and I actually had to do this in another
