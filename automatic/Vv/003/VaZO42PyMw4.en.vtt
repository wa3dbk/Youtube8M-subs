mixing again on the paper to make a more
exciting<00:00:30.630> color<00:00:31.630> wash<00:00:32.590> there<00:00:33.070> if<00:00:33.309> you<00:00:33.460> mix<00:00:33.730> on

00:00:33.990 --> 00:00:34.000 
exciting color wash there if you mix on

00:00:34.000 --> 00:00:36.870 
exciting color wash there if you mix on
the<00:00:34.480> paper<00:00:34.780> you<00:00:34.989> and<00:00:35.620> have<00:00:36.160> too<00:00:36.370> many<00:00:36.460> flat

00:00:36.870 --> 00:00:36.880 
the paper you and have too many flat

00:00:36.880 --> 00:00:40.110 
the paper you and have too many flat
washes<00:00:37.390> of<00:00:37.660> the<00:00:37.840> same<00:00:38.110> flat<00:00:38.590> color<00:00:39.490> we<00:00:39.730> end<00:00:39.940> up

00:00:40.110 --> 00:00:40.120 
washes of the same flat color we end up

00:00:40.120 --> 00:00:43.440 
washes of the same flat color we end up
with<00:00:40.530> a<00:00:41.530> little<00:00:42.010> less<00:00:42.430> exciting<00:00:43.000> painting

00:00:43.440 --> 00:00:43.450 
with a little less exciting painting

00:00:43.450 --> 00:00:46.170 
with a little less exciting painting
than<00:00:43.600> we<00:00:43.750> might<00:00:43.960> if<00:00:44.290> we<00:00:44.320> were<00:00:44.790> mixing<00:00:45.790> on<00:00:46.060> the

00:00:46.170 --> 00:00:46.180 
than we might if we were mixing on the

00:00:46.180 --> 00:00:48.210 
than we might if we were mixing on the
paper<00:00:46.480> and<00:00:46.930> part<00:00:47.170> of<00:00:47.290> the<00:00:47.440> beauty<00:00:48.190> of

00:00:48.210 --> 00:00:48.220 
paper and part of the beauty of

00:00:48.220 --> 00:00:50.430 
paper and part of the beauty of
watercolor<00:00:48.790> is<00:00:49.090> its<00:00:49.450> fluidity<00:00:49.780> and<00:00:50.320> its

00:00:50.430 --> 00:00:50.440 
watercolor is its fluidity and its

00:00:50.440 --> 00:00:53.400 
watercolor is its fluidity and its
ability<00:00:50.710> to<00:00:51.000> move<00:00:52.000> about<00:00:52.300> on<00:00:52.360> the<00:00:52.570> paper<00:00:52.930> after

00:00:53.400 --> 00:00:53.410 
ability to move about on the paper after

00:00:53.410 --> 00:00:56.970 
ability to move about on the paper after
you've<00:00:53.590> established<00:00:54.630> color<00:00:55.630> so<00:00:56.140> as<00:00:56.410> the<00:00:56.770> cliff

00:00:56.970 --> 00:00:56.980 
you've established color so as the cliff

00:00:56.980 --> 00:00:59.370 
you've established color so as the cliff
gets<00:00:57.220> down<00:00:57.430> toward<00:00:57.880> the<00:00:58.180> edge<00:00:58.540> of<00:00:58.780> the<00:00:58.930> surf

00:00:59.370 --> 00:00:59.380 
gets down toward the edge of the surf

00:00:59.380 --> 00:01:03.090 
gets down toward the edge of the surf
there<00:00:59.800> we<00:01:00.160> want<00:01:00.760> to<00:01:00.850> show<00:01:01.270> the<00:01:01.570> earth<00:01:02.320> tone<00:01:02.649> the

00:01:03.090 --> 00:01:03.100 
there we want to show the earth tone the

00:01:03.100 --> 00:01:05.039 
there we want to show the earth tone the
colors<00:01:03.399> of<00:01:03.579> the<00:01:03.670> cliff<00:01:04.000> so<00:01:04.540> I<00:01:04.570> use<00:01:04.780> an<00:01:04.930> earth

00:01:05.039 --> 00:01:05.049 
colors of the cliff so I use an earth

00:01:05.049 --> 00:01:07.680 
colors of the cliff so I use an earth
tone<00:01:05.259> like<00:01:05.500> burnt<00:01:05.799> orange<00:01:06.100> here<00:01:06.790> Quinn<00:01:07.450> burnt

00:01:07.680 --> 00:01:07.690 
tone like burnt orange here Quinn burnt

00:01:07.690 --> 00:01:10.530 
tone like burnt orange here Quinn burnt
orange<00:01:07.990> wash<00:01:08.979> that<00:01:09.220> charge<00:01:09.580> that<00:01:09.670> in<00:01:10.120> and<00:01:10.270> drag

00:01:10.530 --> 00:01:10.540 
orange wash that charge that in and drag

00:01:10.540 --> 00:01:12.149 
orange wash that charge that in and drag
it<00:01:10.720> just<00:01:10.750> a<00:01:10.990> little<00:01:11.140> bit<00:01:11.260> we<00:01:11.860> want<00:01:12.010> to<00:01:12.070> be

00:01:12.149 --> 00:01:12.159 
it just a little bit we want to be

00:01:12.159 --> 00:01:14.550 
it just a little bit we want to be
careful<00:01:12.580> not<00:01:12.760> to<00:01:12.970> overmix<00:01:13.390> what<00:01:13.900> happens<00:01:14.320> when

00:01:14.550 --> 00:01:14.560 
careful not to overmix what happens when

00:01:14.560 --> 00:01:17.640 
careful not to overmix what happens when
we<00:01:14.710> over<00:01:15.250> mix<00:01:15.520> the<00:01:15.940> Quinn<00:01:16.630> gold<00:01:16.990> mixes<00:01:17.500> with

00:01:17.640 --> 00:01:17.650 
we over mix the Quinn gold mixes with

00:01:17.650 --> 00:01:20.010 
we over mix the Quinn gold mixes with
the<00:01:17.680> blue<00:01:17.950> and<00:01:18.130> mixes<00:01:18.430> with<00:01:18.610> the<00:01:18.810> burnt<00:01:19.810> orange

00:01:20.010 --> 00:01:20.020 
the blue and mixes with the burnt orange

00:01:20.020 --> 00:01:21.719 
the blue and mixes with the burnt orange
and<00:01:20.200> they<00:01:20.320> all<00:01:20.440> mix<00:01:20.650> together<00:01:20.830> and<00:01:21.400> the<00:01:21.490> color

00:01:21.719 --> 00:01:21.729 
and they all mix together and the color

00:01:21.729 --> 00:01:23.910 
and they all mix together and the color
becomes<00:01:22.090> more<00:01:22.360> neutral<00:01:22.870> so<00:01:23.380> we<00:01:23.530> want<00:01:23.680> to<00:01:23.770> keep

00:01:23.910 --> 00:01:23.920 
becomes more neutral so we want to keep

00:01:23.920 --> 00:01:28.070 
becomes more neutral so we want to keep
the<00:01:24.310> freshness<00:01:24.640> here<00:01:25.210> so<00:01:26.020> now<00:01:26.140> we<00:01:26.229> saturate<00:01:26.979> my

00:01:28.070 --> 00:01:28.080 
the freshness here so now we saturate my

00:01:28.080 --> 00:01:33.240 
the freshness here so now we saturate my
number-6<00:01:29.080> round<00:01:29.740> with<00:01:30.070> water<00:01:30.400> and<00:01:31.950> nudge<00:01:32.950> the

00:01:33.240 --> 00:01:33.250 
number-6 round with water and nudge the

00:01:33.250 --> 00:01:36.780 
number-6 round with water and nudge the
edge<00:01:33.400> of<00:01:33.700> this<00:01:34.799> headland<00:01:35.799> here<00:01:36.100> to<00:01:36.340> create<00:01:36.640> the

00:01:36.780 --> 00:01:36.790 
edge of this headland here to create the

00:01:36.790 --> 00:01:41.240 
edge of this headland here to create the
sense<00:01:37.030> of<00:01:37.180> the<00:01:37.299> surf<00:01:37.630> and<00:01:38.640> earth<00:01:39.640> meeting<00:01:40.360> here

00:01:41.240 --> 00:01:41.250 
sense of the surf and earth meeting here

00:01:41.250 --> 00:01:45.149 
sense of the surf and earth meeting here
and<00:01:42.250> just<00:01:42.460> soften<00:01:43.000> that<00:01:43.210> and<00:01:43.810> that<00:01:44.040> what<00:01:45.040> it

00:01:45.149 --> 00:01:45.159 
and just soften that and that what it

00:01:45.159 --> 00:01:47.490 
and just soften that and that what it
does<00:01:45.369> is<00:01:45.610> settles<00:01:46.030> the<00:01:46.390> shape<00:01:47.170> of<00:01:47.409> the

00:01:47.490 --> 00:01:47.500 
does is settles the shape of the

00:01:47.500 --> 00:01:51.719 
does is settles the shape of the
headland<00:01:47.860> down<00:01:48.040> into<00:01:48.580> the<00:01:50.310> into<00:01:51.310> the<00:01:51.430> sea

00:01:51.719 --> 00:01:51.729 
headland down into the into the sea

00:01:51.729 --> 00:01:54.480 
headland down into the into the sea
there<00:01:52.060> into<00:01:52.360> the<00:01:52.479> cut<00:01:52.689> into<00:01:53.140> that<00:01:53.320> Cove<00:01:53.619> and<00:01:53.890> at

00:01:54.480 --> 00:01:54.490 
there into the cut into that Cove and at

00:01:54.490 --> 00:01:56.789 
there into the cut into that Cove and at
this<00:01:54.640> time<00:01:54.880> I<00:01:54.939> can<00:01:55.240> actually<00:01:56.049> deepen<00:01:56.650> the

00:01:56.789 --> 00:01:56.799 
this time I can actually deepen the

00:01:56.799 --> 00:01:59.399 
this time I can actually deepen the
value<00:01:57.250> of<00:01:57.430> the<00:01:57.580> water<00:01:57.820> here<00:01:58.299> and<00:01:58.330> link<00:01:58.720> some<00:01:59.380> of

00:01:59.399 --> 00:01:59.409 
value of the water here and link some of

00:01:59.409 --> 00:02:01.920 
value of the water here and link some of
the<00:01:59.560> color<00:01:59.830> of<00:02:00.130> the<00:02:00.310> headland<00:02:00.759> into<00:02:01.180> the<00:02:01.360> ocean

00:02:01.920 --> 00:02:01.930 
the color of the headland into the ocean

00:02:01.930 --> 00:02:08.960 
the color of the headland into the ocean
as<00:02:02.110> it<00:02:02.229> comes<00:02:02.470> up<00:02:02.619> along<00:02:02.979> the<00:02:03.130> beach<00:02:03.340> line<00:02:03.670> here

00:02:08.960 --> 00:02:08.970 

00:02:08.970 --> 00:02:12.839 

so<00:02:09.970> here<00:02:10.239> linking<00:02:11.019> this<00:02:11.439> to<00:02:11.739> this<00:02:11.889> I<00:02:12.129> allow<00:02:12.459> a

00:02:12.839 --> 00:02:12.849 
so here linking this to this I allow a

00:02:12.849 --> 00:02:15.059 
so here linking this to this I allow a
lost-and-found<00:02:13.299> edge<00:02:13.840> to<00:02:14.109> happen<00:02:14.560> right<00:02:14.799> here

00:02:15.059 --> 00:02:15.069 
lost-and-found edge to happen right here

00:02:15.069 --> 00:02:16.860 
lost-and-found edge to happen right here
so<00:02:15.249> we<00:02:15.879> have<00:02:15.999> some<00:02:16.209> linkage

00:02:16.860 --> 00:02:16.870 
so we have some linkage

00:02:16.870 --> 00:02:19.320 
so we have some linkage
to<00:02:16.989> the<00:02:17.200> headline<00:02:17.530> shape<00:02:17.769> that<00:02:18.430> unifies<00:02:19.090> your

00:02:19.320 --> 00:02:19.330 
to the headline shape that unifies your

00:02:19.330 --> 00:02:25.229 
to the headline shape that unifies your
painting<00:02:21.629> you<00:02:22.629> carry<00:02:22.900> that<00:02:23.080> on<00:02:23.140> out<00:02:23.470> and<00:02:24.239> we

00:02:25.229 --> 00:02:25.239 
painting you carry that on out and we

00:02:25.239 --> 00:02:28.440 
painting you carry that on out and we
want<00:02:25.540> to<00:02:25.629> remember<00:02:25.989> that<00:02:26.430> the<00:02:27.430> ocean<00:02:27.819> is<00:02:28.330> not

00:02:28.440 --> 00:02:28.450 
want to remember that the ocean is not

00:02:28.450 --> 00:02:30.720 
want to remember that the ocean is not
like<00:02:28.840> the<00:02:28.989> song<00:02:29.200> the<00:02:29.440> ocean<00:02:29.799> blue<00:02:30.069> or<00:02:30.370> the<00:02:30.400> term

00:02:30.720 --> 00:02:30.730 
like the song the ocean blue or the term

00:02:30.730 --> 00:02:32.910 
like the song the ocean blue or the term
the<00:02:30.970> ocean<00:02:31.330> blue<00:02:31.569> it<00:02:32.260> may<00:02:32.530> have<00:02:32.709> different

00:02:32.910 --> 00:02:32.920 
the ocean blue it may have different

00:02:32.920 --> 00:02:36.180 
the ocean blue it may have different
colors<00:02:33.459> in<00:02:33.670> it<00:02:33.819> so<00:02:34.060> I'm<00:02:34.470> using<00:02:35.470> a<00:02:35.680> little<00:02:35.890> bit

00:02:36.180 --> 00:02:36.190 
colors in it so I'm using a little bit

00:02:36.190 --> 00:02:38.280 
colors in it so I'm using a little bit
of<00:02:36.400> phthalo<00:02:36.790> green<00:02:36.940> and<00:02:37.420> as<00:02:37.599> we've<00:02:37.840> discussed

00:02:38.280 --> 00:02:38.290 
of phthalo green and as we've discussed

00:02:38.290 --> 00:02:40.050 
of phthalo green and as we've discussed
in<00:02:38.500> other<00:02:38.680> discussions<00:02:39.400> too<00:02:39.579> Ella<00:02:39.670> green<00:02:39.940> is

00:02:40.050 --> 00:02:40.060 
in other discussions too Ella green is

00:02:40.060 --> 00:02:42.149 
in other discussions too Ella green is
very<00:02:40.150> staining<00:02:41.019> color<00:02:41.440> so<00:02:41.680> you<00:02:41.769> have<00:02:41.890> to<00:02:42.010> use

00:02:42.149 --> 00:02:42.159 
very staining color so you have to use

00:02:42.159 --> 00:02:44.759 
very staining color so you have to use
just<00:02:42.190> a<00:02:42.549> very<00:02:42.879> very<00:02:43.239> tiny<00:02:43.629> bit<00:02:44.079> of<00:02:44.200> that<00:02:44.349> with

00:02:44.759 --> 00:02:44.769 
just a very very tiny bit of that with

00:02:44.769 --> 00:02:46.619 
just a very very tiny bit of that with
the<00:02:44.980> cobalt<00:02:45.519> blue<00:02:45.700> or<00:02:45.730> whatever<00:02:46.060> other<00:02:46.360> color

00:02:46.619 --> 00:02:46.629 
the cobalt blue or whatever other color

00:02:46.629 --> 00:02:49.860 
the cobalt blue or whatever other color
you're<00:02:46.870> using<00:02:46.900> for<00:02:47.440> the<00:02:47.530> ocean<00:02:48.540> so<00:02:49.540> if<00:02:49.720> you're

00:02:49.860 --> 00:02:49.870 
you're using for the ocean so if you're

00:02:49.870 --> 00:02:51.900 
you're using for the ocean so if you're
painting<00:02:50.140> another<00:02:50.530> seascape<00:02:51.250> the<00:02:51.489> sea<00:02:51.700> might

00:02:51.900 --> 00:02:51.910 
painting another seascape the sea might

00:02:51.910 --> 00:02:54.479 
painting another seascape the sea might
be<00:02:52.120> silver<00:02:52.599> gray<00:02:52.840> or<00:02:53.109> copper<00:02:53.620> color<00:02:54.010> so<00:02:54.280> this

00:02:54.479 --> 00:02:54.489 
be silver gray or copper color so this

00:02:54.489 --> 00:02:56.099 
be silver gray or copper color so this
is<00:02:54.700> not<00:02:54.879> something<00:02:55.420> that<00:02:55.450> you<00:02:55.690> might

00:02:56.099 --> 00:02:56.109 
is not something that you might

00:02:56.109 --> 00:02:57.900 
is not something that you might
necessarily<00:02:56.319> use<00:02:56.859> for<00:02:57.099> every<00:02:57.430> single

00:02:57.900 --> 00:02:57.910 
necessarily use for every single

00:02:57.910 --> 00:03:00.270 
necessarily use for every single
painting<00:02:58.510> that<00:02:58.660> you<00:02:58.900> do<00:02:59.170> of<00:02:59.349> this<00:02:59.500> ocean<00:02:59.829> but

00:03:00.270 --> 00:03:00.280 
painting that you do of this ocean but

00:03:00.280 --> 00:03:02.819 
painting that you do of this ocean but
for<00:03:01.000> this<00:03:01.090> particular<00:03:01.870> piece<00:03:02.140> this<00:03:02.530> is<00:03:02.709> the

00:03:02.819 --> 00:03:02.829 
for this particular piece this is the

00:03:02.829 --> 00:03:05.640 
for this particular piece this is the
way<00:03:02.980> we're<00:03:03.220> working
