00:00:11.050 --> 00:00:15.520
 Now we're going to learn how to do the 

00:00:13.150 --> 00:00:18.550
 chicken meat to make the 

00:00:15.520 --> 00:00:22.270
 and ham we need the breast of 

00:00:18.550 --> 00:00:23.920
 chicken we're going to make it different from the 

00:00:22.270 --> 00:00:27.130
 that this was not the case 

00:00:23.920 --> 00:00:27.910
 presented enters the thigh and fan and the chest 

00:00:27.130 --> 00:00:30.820
 of chicken 

00:00:27.910 --> 00:00:34.000
 in the case of ham we will only use the 

00:00:30.820 --> 00:00:36.670
 chicken breast well to make the 

00:00:34.000 --> 00:00:39.670
 ham and let's make a pickle 

00:00:36.670 --> 00:00:40.270
 we put it in the brine for 24 

00:00:39.670 --> 00:00:43.840
 hours 

00:00:40.270 --> 00:00:46.300
 this brine is made is double the 

00:00:43.840 --> 00:00:48.910
 volume of meat weight 

00:00:46.300 --> 00:00:50.920
 so in case we weigh two 

00:00:48.910 --> 00:00:51.850
 pounds of meat 2 pounds of breast 

00:00:50.920 --> 00:00:54.160
 chicken 

00:00:51.850 --> 00:00:57.370
 So let's make four liters of 

00:00:54.160 --> 00:00:59.739
 brine twice the load weight and 

00:00:57.370 --> 00:01:03.309
 In this brine what we are going to put 

00:00:59.739 --> 00:01:05.560
 We'll put 100 grams of super 

00:01:03.309 --> 00:01:07.990
 yield per liter now we go 

00:01:05.560 --> 00:01:12.820
 calculate per liter of product 

00:01:07.990 --> 00:01:15.520
 this super income he has in him the 

00:01:12.820 --> 00:01:18.040
 salt of healing and an antioxidant comes 

00:01:15.520 --> 00:01:20.080
 together in the same product well the other 

00:01:18.040 --> 00:01:22.570
 ingredient is salt 

00:01:20.080 --> 00:01:25.780
 we will use 60 grams of salt per 

00:01:22.570 --> 00:01:29.860
 liter of brine is just like 

00:01:25.780 --> 00:01:32.650
 condiment the next big in you are 

00:01:29.860 --> 00:01:35.620
 18 grams of sugar per liter of 

00:01:32.650 --> 00:01:38.170
 brine the sugar and it will work 

00:01:35.620 --> 00:01:43.570
 with a preservative is a preservative 

00:01:38.170 --> 00:01:46.180
 natural and finally 8 grams of condiment 

00:01:43.570 --> 00:01:47.800
 california per liter of brine the 

00:01:46.180 --> 00:01:51.310
 california condiment flavoring 

00:01:47.800 --> 00:01:53.380
 itself to be used in the right ham 

00:01:51.310 --> 00:01:55.840
 He's going to give that flavor. 

00:01:53.380 --> 00:01:59.980
 feature characteristic color of the 

00:01:55.840 --> 00:02:02.860
 ham then the heavy ingredients 

00:01:59.980 --> 00:02:03.580
 We'll mix absolve them in the 

00:02:02.860 --> 00:02:05.230
 Water 

00:02:03.580 --> 00:02:07.330
 We'll start with the sub income 

00:02:05.230 --> 00:02:09.459
 people should try to start with sub 

00:02:07.330 --> 00:02:12.580
 income because he has a little bit 

00:02:09.459 --> 00:02:15.010
 more difficult to dissolve 

00:02:12.580 --> 00:02:18.540
 So it does not embarrass him when the 

00:02:15.010 --> 00:02:18.540
 people along with the other ingredients 

00:02:18.690 --> 00:02:25.420
 we try to solve it first 

00:02:23.040 --> 00:02:27.700
 now we have developed all the 

00:02:25.420 --> 00:02:29.470
 ingredients in the water have made the 

00:02:27.700 --> 00:02:32.560
 brine we're ready with it 

00:02:29.470 --> 00:02:33.790
 so we'll put the steaks right 

00:02:32.560 --> 00:02:36.760
 chicken breast 

00:02:33.790 --> 00:02:50.350
 in that brine and we'll leave 24 hours 

00:02:36.760 --> 00:02:53.740
 in the cold room after the 24 hours that we 

00:02:50.350 --> 00:03:00.100
 we leave the ham in the brine 

00:02:53.740 --> 00:03:09.160
 we'll take it out of the brine 

00:03:00.100 --> 00:03:11.709
 and the spree in pure water with nothing to 

00:03:09.160 --> 00:03:14.080
 people are in this area that people 

00:03:11.709 --> 00:03:22.630
 removes excess salt has perchance 

00:03:14.080 --> 00:03:24.760
 this way to line the shape with a 

00:03:22.630 --> 00:03:26.950
 plastic for cooking and 

00:03:24.760 --> 00:03:32.050
 distribute the meats well in a 

00:03:26.950 --> 00:03:33.730
 uniform think as not presented in the 

00:03:32.050 --> 00:03:36.340
 case of ham we're going to do as 

00:03:33.730 --> 00:03:39.610
 we did in the presented is us already 

00:03:36.340 --> 00:03:42.250
 let him in the cooking do not withdraw 

00:03:39.610 --> 00:03:44.380
 he of the hot water in the epoch degrees 

00:03:42.250 --> 00:03:46.050
 Let's give a thermal shock as we 

00:03:44.380 --> 00:03:49.270
 did in the province 

00:03:46.050 --> 00:03:50.110
 let's leave in this cold water for 15 

00:03:49.270 --> 00:03:53.470
 minutes 

00:03:50.110 --> 00:03:56.020
 It's about 15 minutes and then we're going 

00:03:53.470 --> 00:04:00.760
 take to the camera creates and let's inform 

00:03:56.020 --> 00:04:03.819
 the next day, it 's only 

00:04:00.760 --> 00:04:07.170
 to be informed is marketed in the same 

00:04:03.819 --> 00:04:07.170
 in the way that the
