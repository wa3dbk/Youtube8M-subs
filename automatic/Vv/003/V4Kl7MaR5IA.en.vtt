00:00:04.509 --> 00:00:06.660
 Oh 

00:00:07.500 --> 00:00:19.869
 The Silver Star in 1948 is in the Malacca Strait, Indonesia 

00:00:13.120 --> 00:00:25.779
 The radio signal that received one radio signal was on the way to India Jakarta 

00:00:19.869 --> 00:00:27.039
 From a person who seems to be a radio engineer of this ship , which comes from the ditch of the Dutch flag Ogawa yolk 

00:00:25.779 --> 00:00:31.869
 Met 

00:00:27.039 --> 00:00:37.360
 The contents of the radio were dead for all the crew including the captain 

00:00:31.869 --> 00:00:42.090
 All the crew died as they fell in the chat room and the bridge 

00:00:37.360 --> 00:00:48.210
 And I was a horrible thing, Chinu 

00:00:42.090 --> 00:00:49.380
 That most curry is Inose members that are on the verge of it and myself of death crisis died 

00:00:48.210 --> 00:00:52.070
 Tell etc 

00:00:49.380 --> 00:00:56.030
 The radio was cut off halfway 

00:00:52.070 --> 00:01:01.280
 The Silver Star which I thought suspiciously approaches the yellow egg eye rigging 

00:00:56.030 --> 00:01:05.479
 There when the boarded the sailors had spread is horrible sight 

00:01:01.280 --> 00:01:11.780
 All the crew died as they were on his radio 

00:01:05.479 --> 00:01:12.090
 Above all strange things pulled in with fear as if everyone saw something horrible at once 

00:01:11.780 --> 00:01:13.840
 table 

00:01:12.090 --> 00:01:21.009
 I was jealous 

00:01:13.840 --> 00:01:27.039
 It's also strange to say that they were all stretching their arms as if they were trying to grab something 

00:01:21.009 --> 00:01:30.230
 Every body also examine the bodies there and I wonder was attacked by someone in a mountain 

00:01:27.039 --> 00:01:36.080
 There were no foreign wounds 

00:01:30.230 --> 00:01:41.900
 Than it was quite intact itself the contrary this ship egg yolk Medan 

00:01:36.080 --> 00:01:42.590
 The crew of the Silver Star, who felt increasingly suspicious, tried to investigate the ship 

00:01:41.900 --> 00:01:46.490
 Time 

00:01:42.590 --> 00:01:50.220
 Sakuraran first single horizontal are both up in flames with the violent explosion sound 

00:01:46.490 --> 00:01:55.860
 The crew of the Silver Star issue has been forced to withdraw 

00:01:50.220 --> 00:02:01.310
 The yellow egg Medan's hull, which got fiercely burned after the crew 's withdrawal, leaned 

00:01:55.860 --> 00:02:07.820
 The hull carrying the remains of many crew members sank to the bottom of the sea 

00:02:01.310 --> 00:02:14.480
 The dispatch team was sent in to investigate the cause after that, but the detailed sinking cause etc. was identified 

00:02:07.820 --> 00:02:17.959
 Is not even standing on the cause of death of the clean up was crew as due to some unexpected factors 

00:02:14.480 --> 00:02:21.300
 From the fact that the ship is burning up and sinking 

00:02:17.959 --> 00:02:24.900
 Most also little right now a clue 

00:02:21.300 --> 00:02:28.830
 Is a mystery and the cause of death has not been identified 

00:02:24.900 --> 00:02:35.550
 By the way, the situation when approaching the yellow egg eye dango 

00:02:28.830 --> 00:02:40.680
 According to the story that the Silver Star crew later told, the number of hulls of the TSE yellow egg Medan was numerous 

00:02:35.550 --> 00:02:41.290
 It is that it was surrounded by the shark of the sea, and it is understood what this means 

00:02:40.680 --> 00:02:47.349
 Not 

00:02:41.290 --> 00:02:49.769
 Led Although such as the occurrence of toxic gas in the theory has been mentioned so far say that this is also a powerful opinion 

00:02:47.349 --> 00:02:49.769
 Not
