in defense mode but thing is what you're
able<00:04:53.570> to<00:04:53.720> do<00:04:53.900> then<00:04:54.140> is<00:04:54.380> not<00:04:54.920> only<00:04:55.100> did<00:04:55.220> you<00:04:55.310> get

00:04:55.450 --> 00:04:55.460 
able to do then is not only did you get

00:04:55.460 --> 00:04:57.340 
able to do then is not only did you get
a<00:04:55.610> more<00:04:56.420> likely<00:04:56.720> you<00:04:56.780> got<00:04:56.900> a<00:04:56.930> free<00:04:57.110> card

00:04:57.340 --> 00:04:57.350 
a more likely you got a free card

00:04:57.350 --> 00:04:58.840 
a more likely you got a free card
because<00:04:57.560> you<00:04:57.830> have<00:04:57.980> to<00:04:58.040> have<00:04:58.130> life<00:04:58.550> points

00:04:58.840 --> 00:04:58.850

00:04:58.850 --> 00:04:59.860 
because you have to have life points
higher<00:04:59.000> than<00:04:59.030> your<00:04:59.270> opponent<00:04:59.540> to<00:04:59.600> get<00:04:59.720> the

00:05:01.690 --> 00:05:01.700 
cactus bounced around the first place so

00:05:01.700 --> 00:05:03.640 
cactus bounced around the first place so
more<00:05:01.820> likely<00:05:02.120> you<00:05:02.270> get<00:05:02.450> to<00:05:02.660> get<00:05:03.200> a<00:05:03.230> free<00:05:03.440> card

00:05:03.640 --> 00:05:03.650

or dies if characters bouncer survives

00:05:11.480 --> 00:05:12.670 
or dies if characters bouncer survives
and<00:05:11.780> you<00:05:11.990> should<00:05:12.200> be<00:05:12.290> ahead<00:05:12.380> of<00:05:12.530> the<00:05:12.620> game

00:05:14.650 --> 00:05:14.660 
anyways and what I love what this deck

00:05:14.660 --> 00:05:17.170 
anyways and what I love what this deck
is<00:05:14.690> that<00:05:15.110> aroma<00:05:15.680> garden<00:05:16.250> actually<00:05:16.670> increases

00:05:17.170 --> 00:05:17.180 
is that aroma garden actually increases

00:05:17.180 --> 00:05:20.500 
is that aroma garden actually increases
the<00:05:17.450> attack<00:05:17.660> and<00:05:18.110> defense<00:05:18.620> of<00:05:18.800> all<00:05:19.510> monsters

00:05:20.500 --> 00:05:20.510 
the attack and defense of all monsters

00:05:20.510 --> 00:05:23.080 
the attack and defense of all monsters
you<00:05:20.720> control<00:05:20.750> so<00:05:21.620> that<00:05:21.980> actually<00:05:22.370> increases

00:05:23.080 --> 00:05:23.090 
you control so that actually increases

00:05:23.090 --> 00:05:26.140 
you control so that actually increases
cactus<00:05:23.450> bouncers<00:05:23.780> a<00:05:23.930> 2300<00:05:24.770> is<00:05:24.950> 100<00:05:25.760> short<00:05:25.910> off

00:05:26.140 --> 00:05:26.150 
cactus bouncers a 2300 is 100 short off

00:05:26.150 --> 00:05:28.330 
cactus bouncers a 2300 is 100 short off
of<00:05:26.330> Andy's<00:05:26.720> phim<00:05:27.050> and<00:05:27.290> then<00:05:27.800> he's<00:05:27.980> feeling

00:05:28.330 --> 00:05:28.340 
of Andy's phim and then he's feeling

00:05:28.340 --> 00:05:30.190 
of Andy's phim and then he's feeling
requires<00:05:28.610> a<00:05:28.730> tribute<00:05:29.060> and<00:05:29.180> of<00:05:29.600> course<00:05:29.810> this<00:05:30.050> is

00:05:30.190 --> 00:05:30.200 
requires a tribute and of course this is

00:05:30.200 --> 00:05:32.590 
requires a tribute and of course this is
still<00:05:30.410> letting<00:05:30.560> you<00:05:30.680> get<00:05:30.890> draw<00:05:31.130> power<00:05:31.340> and<00:05:31.670> I

00:05:32.590 --> 00:05:32.600 
still letting you get draw power and I

00:05:32.600 --> 00:05:33.550 
still letting you get draw power and I
just<00:05:32.750> think<00:05:32.900> the<00:05:32.960> deck<00:05:33.110> is<00:05:33.230> really<00:05:33.440> really

00:05:33.550 --> 00:05:33.560 
just think the deck is really really

00:05:33.560 --> 00:05:35.950 
just think the deck is really really
strong<00:05:33.890> but<00:05:34.160> yeah<00:05:34.400> beyond<00:05:35.300> look<00:05:35.540> up<00:05:35.720> for<00:05:35.840> our

00:05:35.950 --> 00:05:35.960 
strong but yeah beyond look up for our

00:05:35.960 --> 00:05:37.480 
strong but yeah beyond look up for our
mages<00:05:36.230> and<00:05:36.350> I<00:05:36.500> think<00:05:36.710> that<00:05:36.830> this<00:05:37.010> deck<00:05:37.250> right

00:05:37.480 --> 00:05:37.490 
mages and I think that this deck right

00:05:37.490 --> 00:05:39.400 
mages and I think that this deck right
here<00:05:37.700> can<00:05:38.150> make<00:05:38.330> use<00:05:38.540> of<00:05:38.660> joint<00:05:38.930> ghetto<00:05:39.110> more

00:05:39.400 --> 00:05:39.410 
here can make use of joint ghetto more

00:05:39.410 --> 00:05:41.440 
here can make use of joint ghetto more
than<00:05:39.560> anything<00:05:39.920> else<00:05:40.250> right<00:05:40.670> now<00:05:40.850> and<00:05:41.240> plus

00:05:41.440 --> 00:05:41.450

00:05:46.370 --> 00:05:48.040 
jasmine is like you best but believe BLS
should<00:05:47.000> go<00:05:47.120> in<00:05:47.240> here<00:05:47.390> I<00:05:47.420> didn't<00:05:47.690> actually<00:05:47.750> put

00:05:48.040 --> 00:05:48.050 
should go in here I didn't actually put

00:05:48.050 --> 00:05:49.300 
should go in here I didn't actually put
in<00:05:48.110> here<00:05:48.200> because<00:05:48.380> it<00:05:48.500> probably<00:05:48.920> is<00:05:49.190> that

00:05:49.300 --> 00:05:49.310 
in here because it probably is that

00:05:49.310 --> 00:05:51.580 
in here because it probably is that
really<00:05:49.520> that<00:05:49.730> necessary<00:05:50.360> lies<00:05:51.020> should<00:05:51.290> go<00:05:51.440> in

00:05:51.580 --> 00:05:51.590 
really that necessary lies should go in

00:05:51.590 --> 00:05:53.140 
really that necessary lies should go in
here<00:05:51.770> for<00:05:51.980> sure<00:05:52.160> there's<00:05:52.760> because<00:05:52.850> it's<00:05:53.030> so

00:05:53.140 --> 00:05:53.150 
here for sure there's because it's so

00:05:53.150 --> 00:05:55.090 
here for sure there's because it's so
good<00:05:53.330> I<00:05:53.480> really<00:05:53.690> wish<00:05:53.780> there<00:05:53.930> was<00:05:54.050> more<00:05:54.100> ro

00:05:55.090 --> 00:05:55.100 
good I really wish there was more ro

00:05:55.100 --> 00:05:57.070 
good I really wish there was more ro
majors<00:05:55.580> but<00:05:55.790> at<00:05:56.030> the<00:05:56.300> moment<00:05:56.420> I<00:05:56.690> think<00:05:56.750> that

00:05:57.070 --> 00:05:57.080 
majors but at the moment I think that

00:05:57.080 --> 00:05:58.720 
majors but at the moment I think that
this<00:05:57.470> definitely<00:05:57.890> makes<00:05:58.010> the<00:05:58.130> deck<00:05:58.310> viable

00:05:58.720 --> 00:05:58.730 
this definitely makes the deck viable

00:05:58.730 --> 00:06:01.960 
this definitely makes the deck viable
but<00:05:58.850> like<00:05:59.210> I<00:05:59.330> said<00:06:00.250> cry<00:06:01.250> it<00:06:01.310> out<00:06:01.370> yourself<00:06:01.760> see

00:06:01.960 --> 00:06:01.970 
but like I said cry it out yourself see

00:06:01.970 --> 00:06:03.610 
but like I said cry it out yourself see
what<00:06:02.120> you'd<00:06:02.270> like<00:06:02.480> and<00:06:02.810> i'll<00:06:03.350> do<00:06:03.440> a<00:06:03.470> deck

00:06:03.610 --> 00:06:03.620 
what you'd like and i'll do a deck

00:06:03.620 --> 00:06:05.230 
what you'd like and i'll do a deck
profile<00:06:03.920> of<00:06:04.130> the<00:06:04.460> deck<00:06:04.610> once<00:06:04.790> i<00:06:04.940> do<00:06:05.060> a<00:06:05.090> little

00:06:05.230 --> 00:06:05.240 
profile of the deck once i do a little

00:06:05.240 --> 00:06:06.730 
profile of the deck once i do a little
bit<00:06:05.360> more<00:06:05.480> testing<00:06:05.930> but<00:06:06.080> overall<00:06:06.560> i<00:06:06.650> think

00:06:06.730 --> 00:06:06.740 
bit more testing but overall i think

00:06:06.740 --> 00:06:08.230 
bit more testing but overall i think
it's<00:06:07.010> a<00:06:07.070> relatively<00:06:07.310> strong<00:06:07.670> deck<00:06:07.850> kinda<00:06:08.060> has

00:06:08.230 --> 00:06:08.240 
it's a relatively strong deck kinda has

00:06:08.240 --> 00:06:09.910 
it's a relatively strong deck kinda has
a<00:06:08.270> little<00:06:08.630> bit<00:06:08.780> of<00:06:08.840> potential<00:06:09.260> name<00:06:09.410> but

00:06:09.910 --> 00:06:09.920 
a little bit of potential name but

00:06:09.920 --> 00:06:13.420 
a little bit of potential name but
thanks<00:06:10.160> for<00:06:10.250> watching<00:06:10.460> guys<00:06:10.550> asian<00:06:11.030> eyes<00:06:11.150> out
