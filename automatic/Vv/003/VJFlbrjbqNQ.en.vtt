00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.990
 in this video we will see how to make 

00:00:01.680 --> 00:00:06.660
 the chocolate tartlets we are going to 

00:00:03.990 --> 00:00:07.940
 need 100 grams of chocolate a 

00:00:06.660 --> 00:00:10.880
 egg 

00:00:07.940 --> 00:00:14.150
 70 grams of sugar 200 milliliters of 

00:00:10.880 --> 00:00:16.520
 cream puff pastry cutters and a couple 

00:00:14.150 --> 00:00:17.960
 of molds of these the first thing that there 

00:00:16.520 --> 00:00:20.180
 what to do is to melt the 

00:00:17.960 --> 00:00:22.610
 chocolate you have to spread the pasta 

00:00:20.180 --> 00:00:25.400
 puff pastry once it's more or less than 

00:00:22.610 --> 00:00:27.730
 half a centimeter with a cutter because 

00:00:25.400 --> 00:00:27.730
 I'm cutting 

00:00:37.130 --> 00:00:41.720
 and once we have it cut the 

00:00:39.320 --> 00:00:43.010
 placing the conditions in the mountains 

00:00:41.720 --> 00:00:45.690
 they have to be with the flour and with 

00:00:43.010 --> 00:00:48.530
 fat so that is not going to stick 

00:00:45.690 --> 00:00:48.530
 we are going to accommodate 

00:00:48.690 --> 00:00:52.980
 once we're done, we're going to 

00:00:51.000 --> 00:00:56.090
 let stand half an hour in a bowl 

00:00:52.980 --> 00:00:56.090
 let's add the sugar 

00:00:57.600 --> 00:01:00.140
 and again 

00:01:00.690 --> 00:01:04.650
 and we got the strip until both of them 

00:01:02.850 --> 00:01:08.900
 integrate once we have 

00:01:04.650 --> 00:01:08.900
 the steering wheel we will integrate the sand 

00:01:13.180 --> 00:01:17.170
 and we will win once the 

00:01:15.370 --> 00:01:20.020
 played integrated the chocolate with the 

00:01:17.170 --> 00:01:22.650
 cream we're going to add and we're going 

00:01:20.020 --> 00:01:22.650
 to go beat 

00:01:23.710 --> 00:01:28.680
 once it has passed 30 

00:01:25.600 --> 00:01:28.680
 minutes let's go 

00:01:33.740 --> 00:01:40.360
 we are original to rivas or to three quarters 

00:01:48.220 --> 00:01:52.910
 once we are finishing it 

00:01:50.450 --> 00:01:55.880
 pee we're baking in 20 to 30 

00:01:52.910 --> 00:01:57.500
 minutes at 200 degrees centigrade once 

00:01:55.880 --> 00:02:01.150
 that have come out that way we have the 

00:01:57.500 --> 00:02:01.150
 we take off and let them cool 

00:02:01.280 --> 00:02:06.610
 once the state we have a 

00:02:03.650 --> 00:02:06.610
 little icing sugar 

00:02:14.520 --> 00:02:18.090
 and so
