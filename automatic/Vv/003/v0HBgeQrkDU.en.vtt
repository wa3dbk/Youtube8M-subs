00:00:00.639 --> 00:00:05.950
 I'm taking potato soup with me today 

00:00:03.080 --> 00:00:08.750

00:00:05.950 --> 00:00:14.960

00:00:18.110 --> 00:00:20.590

00:00:30.310 --> 00:00:35.620
 When you look at something I want you 

00:00:32.800 --> 00:00:38.399

00:00:35.620 --> 00:00:38.399

00:00:46.960 --> 00:00:54.040

00:00:54.040 --> 00:01:00.640
 70 grams of dried tomatoes and 

00:00:58.540 --> 00:01:04.290
 four bars of green onions i 

00:01:00.640 --> 00:01:04.290
 previously minced a bit 

00:01:05.970 --> 00:01:12.869
 now everything will be at level 5 3 seconds 

00:01:09.670 --> 00:01:12.869
 reduced again 

00:01:20.680 --> 00:01:28.480
 I push that a little bit again 

00:01:22.060 --> 00:01:30.810
 Round now give 800 grams of potatoes 

00:01:28.480 --> 00:01:30.810
 to 

00:01:38.080 --> 00:01:44.490

00:01:41.890 --> 00:01:44.490

00:02:04.200 --> 00:02:15.140
 I'll leave that for five minutes now 

00:02:06.450 --> 00:02:15.140
 heat long at the grandma level 1 

00:02:16.880 --> 00:02:21.410
 Now it will be with salt and pepper 

00:02:29.430 --> 00:02:35.269
 and would give 950 grams of vegetable touch to it 

00:02:45.010 --> 00:02:54.250
 and dried another teaspoon 

00:02:47.590 --> 00:02:58.319
 Marjoram comes to an end 

00:02:54.250 --> 00:02:58.319
 teaspoon of lemon juice 

00:03:03.900 --> 00:03:12.290
 everything is now at 100 for 25 minutes 

00:03:07.470 --> 00:03:12.290
 Grade 1 cooked 

00:03:28.490 --> 00:03:34.220
 some like the soup pieces then 

00:03:31.460 --> 00:03:36.920
 If she was ready now we like her 

00:03:34.220 --> 00:03:39.580
 like a little seminar because of that 

00:03:36.920 --> 00:03:42.580
 namely first a part of the pieces 

00:03:39.580 --> 00:03:42.580
 out 

00:03:52.860 --> 00:04:01.320
 for your rest soup for 30 seconds 

00:03:57.180 --> 00:04:05.030
 doing what I slow it then 2 then 

00:04:01.320 --> 00:04:09.780
 Level four of levels 6 8 and 9 

00:04:05.030 --> 00:04:11.670
 it can happen sometimes 

00:04:09.780 --> 00:04:13.980
 that it squirts out a bit and 

00:04:11.670 --> 00:04:18.630
 the soup is really hot at the top 

00:04:13.980 --> 00:04:21.350
 always aflame with it and hold 

00:04:18.630 --> 00:04:21.350
 secure the lid 

00:04:29.940 --> 00:04:38.210
 after the 30 seconds I give the before 

00:04:33.600 --> 00:04:38.210
 skimmed part of the sum again and 

00:04:38.660 --> 00:04:45.110
 Enjoying it now would be enough 

00:04:41.430 --> 00:04:54.210
 make soup I give two more 

00:04:45.110 --> 00:04:59.550
 reduced fat and buy 

00:04:54.210 --> 00:05:06.360
 they one minute at 100 degrees counter-clockwise 

00:04:59.550 --> 00:05:10.710
 I calculate the level 1 for this soup 

00:05:06.360 --> 00:05:13.430
 then six points the whole is for four 

00:05:10.710 --> 00:05:16.580
 people thought 

00:05:13.430 --> 00:05:16.580
 Enjoy your meal
