 for android and dupont 1 

00:00:10.409 --> 00:00:12.369
 you care about it 

00:00:12.369 --> 00:00:16.920
 our acer liquid present editorial1 you can use any other 

00:00:16.919 --> 00:00:20.619
 cell phone that hates the two. one set 

00:00:20.619 --> 00:00:23.619
 I installed purebred paoletti 

00:00:24.289 --> 00:00:26.319
 let's go straight to the list 

00:00:26.319 --> 00:00:29.800
 of the backgrounds 

00:00:29.800 --> 00:00:32.800
 vat wallpapers 

00:00:33.360 --> 00:00:35.360
 and let's go and see 

00:00:35.360 --> 00:00:37.190
 with you can see we have 

00:00:37.190 --> 00:00:38.460
 the usual ones 

00:00:38.460 --> 00:00:40.650
 default over 

00:00:40.650 --> 00:00:43.930
 while we also installed other vat wallpapers 

00:00:44.600 --> 00:00:47.600
 let's start with aquarium free 

00:00:48.210 --> 00:00:50.530
 that a background today an aquarium 

00:00:50.530 --> 00:00:51.590
 dynamic 

00:00:51.590 --> 00:00:54.590
 which has no options 

00:00:56.160 --> 00:00:59.160
 which is the same for all five faces of our ohm 

00:01:01.540 --> 00:01:04.920
 a little static is similar to that present on aiphon 

00:01:05.830 --> 00:01:08.830
 but he may like it as well as not 

00:01:10.200 --> 00:01:13.200
 a finger in anus sin rai backgrounds 2 

00:01:15.120 --> 00:01:16.720
 earth and lot 

00:01:16.720 --> 00:01:19.060
 which is practically a background 

00:01:19.060 --> 00:01:22.010
 pierre presents the earth 

00:01:22.010 --> 00:01:25.010
 notation on only its own axis 

00:01:25.730 --> 00:01:29.870
 pretty cute only oko resolved to the earth 

00:01:29.870 --> 00:01:31.890
 the PC also the moon 

00:01:31.890 --> 00:01:34.580
 we also have in the additional settings 

00:01:34.580 --> 00:01:37.580
 I have to open it 

00:01:40.100 --> 00:01:43.100
 we can set the appearance of the globe 

00:01:43.750 --> 00:01:45.900
 greatness of the globe 

00:01:45.900 --> 00:01:48.770
 rotation speed 

00:01:48.770 --> 00:01:50.430
 even if not of what 

00:01:50.430 --> 00:01:53.430
 perfected what is the axis 

00:01:54.550 --> 00:01:57.550
 I'm going to see on the blog or the background 

00:01:58.190 --> 00:02:01.190
 present pantheon web but my name is background between 

00:02:05.180 --> 00:02:07.630
 let's try the race 

00:02:07.630 --> 00:02:10.630
 in the cars outside with will provide much smaller lands 

00:02:11.909 --> 00:02:13.269
 and the moon 

00:02:13.269 --> 00:02:14.959
 the g8 

00:02:14.959 --> 00:02:18.439
 we think that many times it has made us mistakes 

00:02:18.439 --> 00:02:19.989
 now though 

00:02:19.989 --> 00:02:22.999
 there was the 

00:02:22.999 --> 00:02:23.829
 names 

00:02:23.829 --> 00:02:26.579
 updating this wallpaper 

00:02:26.579 --> 00:02:29.539
 and no longer has any anomalies whatsoever 

00:02:29.539 --> 00:02:32.669
 this is very pretty 

00:02:32.669 --> 00:02:35.669
 nemo on the hype backgrounds 

00:02:36.359 --> 00:02:39.779
 let's go to worx file 

00:02:39.779 --> 00:02:41.079
 do worx 

00:02:41.079 --> 00:02:43.509
 practically 

00:02:43.509 --> 00:02:45.409
 ii fireworks 

00:02:45.409 --> 00:02:46.819
 so we'll go 

00:02:46.819 --> 00:02:49.159
 goes to see on not only screen 

00:02:49.159 --> 00:02:54.349
 an evening now I have at the sea or on any other or landscape 

00:02:55.539 --> 00:02:59.129
 in a pyrotechnic event in the background 

00:03:00.279 --> 00:03:01.450
 vellamo change 

00:03:01.450 --> 00:03:04.900
 20 rounds hachiko we have intimate settings for example 

00:03:06.319 --> 00:03:09.319
 the star the sites 

00:03:09.899 --> 00:03:12.899
 we increase 

00:03:15.139 --> 00:03:16.789
 we increase 

00:03:16.789 --> 00:03:19.789
 the greatness of fireworks 

00:03:20.359 --> 00:03:21.730
 we are 

00:03:21.730 --> 00:03:24.730
 change color is the quantity will accept 

00:03:26.059 --> 00:03:29.059
 with you and you see now we have 

00:03:30.529 --> 00:03:32.509
 with our fireworks 

00:03:32.509 --> 00:03:35.349
 very nice too 

00:03:35.349 --> 00:03:38.899
 same for all five faces, however it is not a defect 

00:03:41.179 --> 00:03:44.179
 let's change that too 

00:03:47.869 --> 00:03:50.869
 we put 

00:03:51.609 --> 00:03:54.269
 ethically we have this galaxy 

00:03:54.269 --> 00:03:58.430
 which turns on itself but we have no settings 

00:03:59.319 --> 00:04:01.149
 it 

00:04:01.149 --> 00:04:04.559
 additional then setting this to go to 

00:04:04.559 --> 00:04:07.799
 will be the same for all 5 screens a little static 

00:04:08.689 --> 00:04:11.689
 morara very far 

00:04:12.969 --> 00:04:15.029
 let's try to go 

00:04:15.029 --> 00:04:17.819
 change another one 

00:04:17.819 --> 00:04:18.999
 we have 

00:04:18.999 --> 00:04:20.470
 nexus moda 

00:04:20.470 --> 00:04:22.330
 what type 

00:04:22.330 --> 00:04:25.330
 me the dynamic background on the nexus 

00:04:26.389 --> 00:04:28.610
 we finish 1 ok 

00:04:28.610 --> 00:04:31.610
 you can see is very similar 

00:04:36.039 --> 00:04:39.210
 we can change 

00:04:39.210 --> 00:04:40.740
 colors 

00:04:40.740 --> 00:04:43.740
 of the throne clashes 

00:04:44.259 --> 00:04:45.380
 trony 

00:04:45.380 --> 00:04:47.590
 these colored lines 

00:04:47.590 --> 00:04:49.430
 if we can't as a background 

00:04:49.430 --> 00:04:51.659
 even going here 

00:04:51.659 --> 00:04:52.889
 on the screen 

00:04:52.889 --> 00:04:55.340
 we are going to generate 

00:04:55.340 --> 00:04:58.620
 4 different colored lines 

00:04:58.620 --> 00:05:01.620
 very similar to the one already present therefore mm 

00:05:02.449 --> 00:05:05.389
 nothing special 

00:05:05.389 --> 00:05:08.039
 I love seeing the polar clock 

00:05:08.039 --> 00:05:12.349
 practically these are almost complete circles that show us 

00:05:13.029 --> 00:05:15.620
 the day the hour 

00:05:15.620 --> 00:05:19.050
 theory also mac and seconds 

00:05:19.050 --> 00:05:23.169
 the need to know how to read +1 

00:05:23.169 --> 00:05:27.099
 can be nice as a background if we always have to see the hora loja un 

00:05:27.099 --> 00:05:29.270
 touch of a little different 

00:05:29.270 --> 00:05:31.559
 We can 

00:05:31.559 --> 00:05:34.559
 set a little thing 

00:05:36.259 --> 00:05:38.180
 colors for example 

00:05:38.180 --> 00:05:40.610
 now that he has put a black hole 

00:05:40.610 --> 00:05:43.610
 I can put blue laser 

00:05:44.620 --> 00:05:46.669
 only color palette 

00:05:46.669 --> 00:05:49.830
 we can't do this either 

00:05:49.830 --> 00:05:53.099
 then, in my opinion, the two prettiest starchilds arrive 

00:05:54.059 --> 00:05:57.529
 that practically 

00:05:57.529 --> 00:05:59.029
 then we complain 

00:05:59.029 --> 00:06:00.309
 the speed 

00:06:00.309 --> 00:06:03.779
 of the stars 

00:06:03.779 --> 00:06:05.090
 we aim at quantity 

00:06:05.090 --> 00:06:08.090
 benny estelle we put 

00:06:11.379 --> 00:06:13.879
 with you can see 

00:06:13.879 --> 00:06:16.639
 this background is really beautiful 

00:06:16.639 --> 00:06:21.060
 seems to be at a spaceship that eva for sport if me 

00:06:21.060 --> 00:06:23.550
 alert very nice 

00:06:23.550 --> 00:06:28.259
 moving one screen to another also changes the angle of these 

00:06:28.259 --> 00:06:30.779
 star 

00:06:30.779 --> 00:06:31.979
 change 

00:06:31.979 --> 00:06:34.979
 and let's go to the last one 

00:06:36.139 --> 00:06:38.380
 then the background the matrix ye 

00:06:38.380 --> 00:06:42.270
 we have practically matrix binary code that cascades down 

00:06:43.099 --> 00:06:46.249
 we are really set up a lot here too 

00:06:48.499 --> 00:06:52.559
 we could say different is a different size to get the fonts 

00:06:53.169 --> 00:06:56.589
 conclusion of the largest thesis 

00:06:56.589 --> 00:06:57.849
 well honestly like it 

00:06:57.849 --> 00:07:00.039
 small 

00:07:00.039 --> 00:07:02.039
 we are 

00:07:02.039 --> 00:07:05.210
 if we take set up 

00:07:05.210 --> 00:07:06.340
 you can't see where you are 

00:07:06.340 --> 00:07:08.289
 I call the screen there 

00:07:08.289 --> 00:07:11.619
 a green trace will come 

00:07:11.619 --> 00:07:14.969
 the same screen for all 

00:07:14.969 --> 00:07:17.029
 hi5 

00:07:17.029 --> 00:07:18.629
 facades of the ohm 

00:07:18.629 --> 00:07:22.860
 us being fanna. we particularly like the movie series 

00:07:22.860 --> 00:07:24.629
 this background 

00:07:24.629 --> 00:07:25.919
 that's all for today 

00:07:25.919 --> 00:07:30.279
 we invite you to always follow us on www.tecnozoom.it book spot.com 

00:07:30.930 --> 00:07:31.599
