00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.440
 citizens of north korea a little 

00:00:02.220 --> 00:00:06.930
 relaxed anniversary of the end of the war 

00:00:04.440 --> 00:00:08.849
 between north and south survived 

00:00:06.930 --> 00:00:11.490
 from marching its now possible 

00:00:08.849 --> 00:00:13.259
 return to the family in the team to work 

00:00:11.490 --> 00:00:16.199
 as they say in our famous movie and 

00:00:13.259 --> 00:00:19.170
 Andrei Gordeev is finally at home hello 

00:00:16.199 --> 00:00:20.520
 return soon i won't let you go 

00:00:19.170 --> 00:00:23.189
 because there are so many things 

00:00:20.520 --> 00:00:25.350
 I wonder what I want to ask, I will say 

00:00:23.189 --> 00:00:28.230
 only to the audience that said today 

00:00:25.350 --> 00:00:31.439
 Andrei behind the sight see this turn out to be 

00:00:28.230 --> 00:00:33.660
 a completely different world, and somehow you 

00:00:31.439 --> 00:00:35.660
 for some reason without enthusiasm 

00:00:33.660 --> 00:00:38.309
 I feel comfortable being somehow hard 

00:00:35.660 --> 00:00:40.649
 No, of course, we all understand that 

00:00:38.309 --> 00:00:43.260
 north korea resort until 

00:00:40.649 --> 00:00:45.600
 psinhe is not a fairy tale city and in general 

00:00:43.260 --> 00:00:47.489
 it is clear that this is such a life in such 

00:00:45.600 --> 00:00:50.670
 enclosed space separated it 

00:00:47.489 --> 00:00:53.940
 the influence of the outside world of life and 

00:00:50.670 --> 00:00:56.370
 controlled well and such a simple example 

00:00:53.940 --> 00:00:58.260
 we all saw it all journalists are very 

00:00:56.370 --> 00:01:00.660
 They were surprised when they saw from the bus window 

00:00:58.260 --> 00:01:03.899
 how people sit on lawns and pluck 

00:01:00.660 --> 00:01:06.570
 grass so it was beautiful here without 

00:01:03.899 --> 00:01:08.310
 sickle tags for me 

00:01:06.570 --> 00:01:11.580
 that is , from morning till late evening 

00:01:08.310 --> 00:01:13.920
 what is called tidying up the city 

00:01:11.580 --> 00:01:15.320
 and we understand again so syanian this 

00:01:13.920 --> 00:01:17.369
 the capital that is this such 

00:01:15.320 --> 00:01:19.170
 exemplary city if there 

00:01:17.369 --> 00:01:22.080
 life is not a fairy tale and how much time is 

00:01:19.170 --> 00:01:24.240
 exemplary you were the last time there 

00:01:22.080 --> 00:01:27.030
 a year and a half ago in april to april 

00:01:24.240 --> 00:01:30.090
 last year that changed the Well 

00:01:27.030 --> 00:01:32.369
 the very first thing that immediately catches your eye 

00:01:30.090 --> 00:01:33.540
 this is something that at the border no longer selected 

00:01:32.369 --> 00:01:35.490
 Cell phones 

00:01:33.540 --> 00:01:37.439
 before how did you come create in 

00:01:35.490 --> 00:01:39.299
 luggage at the airport mobile 

00:01:37.439 --> 00:01:40.049
 phone then returning it to you 

00:01:39.299 --> 00:01:41.579
 I return 

00:01:40.049 --> 00:01:44.040
 to see him means you give 

00:01:41.579 --> 00:01:45.810
 back there is it so absolute 

00:01:44.040 --> 00:01:48.180
 isolation in which you find yourself 

00:01:45.810 --> 00:01:49.829
 Alarm is not a notebook and touch 

00:01:48.180 --> 00:01:51.659
 part of life the phone is missing 

00:01:49.829 --> 00:01:54.329
 now there is no please with the phone 

00:01:51.659 --> 00:01:56.610
 even buy a sim card more than you can 

00:01:54.329 --> 00:01:59.340
 from Moscow call this phone well 

00:01:56.610 --> 00:02:01.439
 it is generally a step forward it is obvious 

00:01:59.340 --> 00:02:04.230
 the city itself has become quite a lot 

00:02:01.439 --> 00:02:07.470
 expensive cars it is clear that these are cars 

00:02:04.230 --> 00:02:09.060
 or you are not ordinary people but in general 

00:02:07.470 --> 00:02:10.500
 this class you are separation on the roads 

00:02:09.060 --> 00:02:11.460
 three years ago was not yet a year and a half 

00:02:10.500 --> 00:02:13.770
 backwards 

00:02:11.460 --> 00:02:15.240
 and as for ordinary people, yes, well here 

00:02:13.770 --> 00:02:17.220
 hard to say too you can't go to 

00:02:15.240 --> 00:02:21.540
 him in the house to go and talk to them 

00:02:17.220 --> 00:02:23.430
 but what is called learn what became of him 

00:02:21.540 --> 00:02:25.560
 let's say the weekend before again 

00:02:23.430 --> 00:02:27.270
 it was like in a six-day working country 

00:02:25.560 --> 00:02:29.280
 weeks from monday to saturday 

00:02:27.270 --> 00:02:31.800
 the only day off is sunday yes 

00:02:29.280 --> 00:02:34.010
 and 4 holidays a year kim birthday 

00:02:31.800 --> 00:02:37.320
 Ir Sen and Kim Chen Ir 

00:02:34.010 --> 00:02:40.770
 here come to the holidays because we 

00:02:37.320 --> 00:02:43.410
 somehow it's all incredibly interesting 

00:02:40.770 --> 00:02:45.840
 Yes, let's see, we want to once again what 

00:02:43.410 --> 00:02:47.850
 was wanting to say an important thing on the very 

00:02:45.840 --> 00:02:49.200
 what they were given they were given for example three 

00:02:47.850 --> 00:02:50.910
 weekend days to the new year 

00:02:49.200 --> 00:02:53.310
 it was unthinkable three days off 

00:02:50.910 --> 00:02:55.560
 like a birthday party 

00:02:53.310 --> 00:02:58.890
 ruling that too was not unless of course 

00:02:55.560 --> 00:03:01.380
 they can not be not happy with our 10 days 

00:02:58.890 --> 00:03:03.090
 On new year all on their relax 

00:03:01.380 --> 00:03:05.070
 but I still wonder when you said 

00:03:03.090 --> 00:03:08.670
 with war veterans who stood on 

00:03:05.070 --> 00:03:11.250
 this parade two hours in the sun to carry 

00:03:08.670 --> 00:03:11.760
 they were not even allowed to sit down all the time 

00:03:11.250 --> 00:03:14.130
 this time 

00:03:11.760 --> 00:03:17.270
 standing is correct or is there garden hotels 

00:03:14.130 --> 00:03:20.430
 Netany say so could sit down but here 

00:03:17.270 --> 00:03:23.190
 they are accepted like this that is they nobody 

00:03:20.430 --> 00:03:24.959
 didn't force them all to poke 

00:03:23.190 --> 00:03:26.130
 old people though to another country 

00:03:24.959 --> 00:03:27.810
 maybe they cooked them somehow 

00:03:26.130 --> 00:03:29.100
 explained that the couple is about to start 

00:03:27.810 --> 00:03:31.170
 will get up 

00:03:29.100 --> 00:03:33.390
 after all maybe it should be so 

00:03:31.170 --> 00:03:35.760
 I know, well, well, or here's the gardener in 

00:03:33.390 --> 00:03:37.530
 Generally those people with whom you talked body 

00:03:35.760 --> 00:03:40.550
 girls who raise these endless 

00:03:37.530 --> 00:03:42.990
 Kim Jong Ira and Kemer blue to them 

00:03:40.550 --> 00:03:46.160
 what is it like to communicate what mood 

00:03:42.990 --> 00:03:49.080
 the fact that they are closed and everything is well 

00:03:46.160 --> 00:03:52.140
 let's say two words propaganda i will say 

00:03:49.080 --> 00:03:55.320
 what do you do what it certainly produces 

00:03:52.140 --> 00:03:58.350
 Strong enough impressions and here it is 

00:03:55.320 --> 00:04:00.510
 but this holiday itself and solemn 

00:03:58.350 --> 00:04:01.950
 march soldiers we are now seeing as a technique 

00:04:00.510 --> 00:04:03.960
 passes by 

00:04:01.950 --> 00:04:05.940
 by area but in fact even more 

00:04:03.960 --> 00:04:08.250
 make a strong impression 

00:04:05.940 --> 00:04:08.820
 own march when the parade goes 

00:04:08.250 --> 00:04:12.180
 calculations 

00:04:08.820 --> 00:04:13.860
 look really even stronger i 

00:04:12.180 --> 00:04:15.780
 I want to show we are all the same 

00:04:13.860 --> 00:04:17.489
 the card you brought because you don't 

00:04:15.780 --> 00:04:21.150
 will remain otherwise temporarily very much 

00:04:17.489 --> 00:04:23.730
 just wonder let's roll let's 

00:04:21.150 --> 00:04:24.890
 let's show here it is a map of the north 

00:04:23.730 --> 00:04:27.810
 korea 

00:04:24.890 --> 00:04:29.490
 let's see how the country presents itself 

00:04:27.810 --> 00:04:31.590
 geographically it is very important for 

00:04:29.490 --> 00:04:34.440
 self-determination first we are here 

00:04:31.590 --> 00:04:36.450
 see we see that korea is one 

00:04:34.440 --> 00:04:39.300
 uniform gas prices and that there is no 

00:04:36.450 --> 00:04:41.280
 you are south and 7 salute but here are 38 parallels 

00:04:39.300 --> 00:04:43.740
 that is, here here is the border here 

00:04:41.280 --> 00:04:46.890
 this is already south korea here for nothing 

00:04:43.740 --> 00:04:48.990
 this is not a map and of course others 

00:04:46.890 --> 00:04:49.770
 name other names here for example it 

00:04:48.990 --> 00:04:51.450
 Japanese Sea 

00:04:49.770 --> 00:04:54.000
 as we all learned in school here this 

00:04:51.450 --> 00:04:57.270
 East Sea Korea is clear that all 

00:04:54.000 --> 00:04:59.520
 Japanese is useful as it 

00:04:57.270 --> 00:05:02.430
 very reaction but this is the sea 

00:04:59.520 --> 00:05:04.350
 yellow here she is western tatra such 

00:05:02.430 --> 00:05:06.450
 absolute as if in separation from 

00:05:04.350 --> 00:05:08.150
 common geography here own 

00:05:06.450 --> 00:05:11.810
 perception of the world here it is 

00:05:08.150 --> 00:05:14.700
 I think that but still now we 

00:05:11.810 --> 00:05:16.890
 need to go to the announcement of what will be in 

00:05:14.700 --> 00:05:20.910
 ten in the evening because there is so much 

00:05:16.890 --> 00:05:22.710
 interesting that the mountaineer is absolutely and we 

00:05:20.910 --> 00:05:25.380
 did not even have time to discuss everything show 

00:05:22.710 --> 00:05:27.680
 periodicals that you are attached there it 

00:05:25.380 --> 00:05:31.220
 fantastically perfect 

00:05:27.680 --> 00:05:34.310
 Edition to be continued at 22 00 

00:05:31.220 --> 00:05:37.580
 Today we will go to the pizzeria 

00:05:34.310 --> 00:05:39.680
 in pyongyang not only in north korea 

00:05:37.580 --> 00:05:42.110
 raise kim chen ira and go in formation 

00:05:39.680 --> 00:05:44.180
 nobody will refuse a slice of pizza 

00:05:42.110 --> 00:05:48.400
 Andrey Gordeev guarantees itself 

00:05:44.180 --> 00:05:48.400
 Today 2200 still meet 

00:05:50.229 --> 00:05:55.900
 thanks, see you here tonight, see you
