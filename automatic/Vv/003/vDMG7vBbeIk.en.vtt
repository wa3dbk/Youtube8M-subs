00:00:18.390 --> 00:00:18.400 
to finger differential okay this is what

00:00:18.400 --> 00:00:21.229 
to finger differential okay this is what
it<00:00:18.430> looks<00:00:18.730> like<00:00:18.910> it's<00:00:19.540> sort<00:00:19.869> of<00:00:19.930> like<00:00:20.110> a<00:00:20.169> belt

00:00:49.290 --> 00:00:49.300 
yourself now that it's on the knuckle

00:00:49.300 --> 00:00:51.720 
yourself now that it's on the knuckle
what<00:00:49.420> kind<00:00:49.570> of<00:00:49.660> a<00:00:49.720> fit<00:00:50.050> is<00:00:50.260> that<00:00:50.290> is<00:00:51.100> that<00:00:51.400> like

00:00:51.720 --> 00:00:51.730 
what kind of a fit is that is that like

00:00:51.730 --> 00:00:55.050 
what kind of a fit is that is that like
a<00:00:51.760> hard<00:00:52.630> fit<00:00:53.079> a<00:00:53.290> soft<00:00:53.739> fit<00:00:54.130> you<00:00:54.610> know<00:00:54.730> that<00:00:54.880> went

00:01:16.169 --> 00:01:16.179 
gonna take this and I'm gonna go up a

00:01:16.179 --> 00:01:18.179 
gonna take this and I'm gonna go up a
half<00:01:16.479> a<00:01:16.689> size<00:01:16.899> it<00:01:17.229> makes<00:01:17.499> a<00:01:17.649> little<00:01:17.740> click

00:01:18.179 --> 00:01:18.189 
half a size it makes a little click

00:01:18.189 --> 00:01:20.580 
half a size it makes a little click
sound<00:01:18.579> now<00:01:19.299> I'm<00:01:19.450> gonna<00:01:19.569> try<00:01:19.810> that<00:01:20.170> on

00:01:20.580 --> 00:01:20.590 
sound now I'm gonna try that on

00:01:20.590 --> 00:01:22.859 
sound now I'm gonna try that on
now<00:01:21.009> that<00:01:21.340> is<00:01:21.729> harder<00:01:22.299> to<00:01:22.329> get<00:01:22.479> over<00:01:22.719> my

00:01:22.859 --> 00:01:22.869 
now that is harder to get over my

00:01:22.869 --> 00:01:25.109 
now that is harder to get over my
knuckle<00:01:22.929> it<00:01:23.409> still<00:01:23.649> goes<00:01:23.799> over<00:01:24.069> my<00:01:24.189> knuckle<00:01:24.249> it

00:01:25.109 --> 00:01:25.119 
knuckle it still goes over my knuckle it

00:01:25.119 --> 00:01:28.109 
knuckle it still goes over my knuckle it
still<00:01:25.420> comes<00:01:25.659> back<00:01:25.929> but<00:01:26.619> I<00:01:26.829> would<00:01:26.979> say<00:01:27.249> if<00:01:27.880> that

00:01:28.109 --> 00:01:28.119 
still comes back but I would say if that

00:01:28.119 --> 00:01:33.660 
still comes back but I would say if that
five<00:01:28.569> and<00:01:28.600> a<00:01:28.869> half<00:01:29.399> was<00:01:31.619> snug

00:01:33.660 --> 00:01:33.670 
five and a half was snug

00:01:33.670 --> 00:01:36.420 
five and a half was snug
now<00:01:34.330> the<00:01:34.390> next<00:01:34.870> measurement<00:01:35.800> you<00:01:35.950> want<00:01:36.070> to<00:01:36.250> get

00:01:36.420 --> 00:01:36.430 
now the next measurement you want to get

00:01:36.430 --> 00:01:40.230 
now the next measurement you want to get
is<00:01:37.180> down<00:01:37.510> at<00:01:37.930> the<00:01:38.080> base<00:01:38.380> of<00:01:38.650> your<00:01:38.770> finger<00:01:39.310> so

00:01:40.230 --> 00:01:40.240 
is down at the base of your finger so

00:01:40.240 --> 00:01:42.600 
is down at the base of your finger so
this<00:01:40.360> is<00:01:40.540> the<00:01:40.659> knuckle<00:01:40.870> size<00:01:41.290> this<00:01:42.280> is<00:01:42.460> the

00:01:42.600 --> 00:01:42.610 
this is the knuckle size this is the

00:01:42.610 --> 00:01:47.030 
this is the knuckle size this is the
finger<00:01:43.000> size

00:01:47.030 --> 00:01:47.040 

00:01:47.040 --> 00:01:49.040 

this<00:01:47.610> is<00:01:47.760> where<00:01:47.940> your<00:01:48.090> ring<00:01:48.360> is<00:01:48.510> gonna<00:01:48.690> live

and a half on it goes okay I'm gonna

00:02:04.110 --> 00:02:06.770 
and a half on it goes okay I'm gonna
have<00:02:04.290> to<00:02:04.440> be<00:02:04.560> one<00:02:04.740> hand<00:02:05.070> up<00:02:05.190> here<00:02:05.460> and<00:02:06.000> I'm

00:02:06.770 --> 00:02:06.780 
have to be one hand up here and I'm

00:02:06.780 --> 00:02:12.890 
have to be one hand up here and I'm
gonna<00:02:06.960> use<00:02:07.410> my<00:02:08.540> thumb<00:02:09.540> to<00:02:10.040> push<00:02:11.040> it<00:02:11.280> tighter<00:02:11.900> so

00:02:12.890 --> 00:02:12.900 
gonna use my thumb to push it tighter so

00:02:12.900 --> 00:02:18.070 
gonna use my thumb to push it tighter so
this<00:02:13.200> is<00:02:13.380> telling<00:02:13.680> me<00:02:13.890> that<00:02:14.370> I'm<00:02:15.270> basically

00:02:18.070 --> 00:02:18.080 

00:02:18.080 --> 00:02:21.920 

I'm<00:02:19.080> thinking<00:02:19.650> that's<00:02:19.770> a<00:02:19.950> four<00:02:20.220> and<00:02:20.370> a<00:02:20.430> half<00:02:20.930> so

00:02:21.920 --> 00:02:21.930 
I'm thinking that's a four and a half so

00:02:21.930 --> 00:02:22.910 
I'm thinking that's a four and a half so
now

00:02:22.910 --> 00:02:22.920 
now

00:02:22.920 --> 00:02:27.860 
now
oh<00:02:23.270> that's<00:02:24.270> moving<00:02:24.959> very<00:02:25.470> easily<00:02:26.090> if<00:02:27.090> I<00:02:27.330> had<00:02:27.600> a

00:02:27.860 --> 00:02:27.870 
oh that's moving very easily if I had a

00:02:27.870 --> 00:02:31.210 
oh that's moving very easily if I had a
narrower<00:02:28.380> ring<00:02:28.800> like<00:02:29.160> maybe<00:02:29.370> half<00:02:29.730> that<00:02:29.760> width

00:02:31.210 --> 00:02:31.220 
narrower ring like maybe half that width

00:02:31.220 --> 00:02:34.760 
narrower ring like maybe half that width
this<00:02:32.220> might<00:02:32.910> drive<00:02:33.270> me<00:02:33.450> a<00:02:33.480> little<00:02:33.660> nuts<00:02:33.930> so

00:02:34.760 --> 00:02:34.770 
this might drive me a little nuts so

00:02:34.770 --> 00:02:36.500 
this might drive me a little nuts so
let's<00:02:34.980> take<00:02:35.220> another<00:02:35.370> look<00:02:35.730> we've<00:02:35.970> got<00:02:36.150> a<00:02:36.180> five

00:02:36.500 --> 00:02:36.510 
let's take another look we've got a five

00:02:36.510 --> 00:02:41.730 
let's take another look we've got a five
here<00:02:36.959> let's<00:02:38.360> pull<00:02:39.360> it<00:02:39.830> there

00:02:41.730 --> 00:02:41.740 
here let's pull it there

00:02:41.740 --> 00:02:47.410 
here let's pull it there
now<00:02:42.160> that<00:02:43.080> moves<00:02:44.080> nicely

00:02:47.410 --> 00:02:47.420 

00:02:47.420 --> 00:02:50.380 

this<00:02:47.990> would<00:02:48.230> be<00:02:48.380> very<00:02:48.650> comfortable<00:02:49.340> for<00:02:50.330> a

00:02:50.380 --> 00:02:50.390 
this would be very comfortable for a

00:02:50.390 --> 00:02:53.860 
this would be very comfortable for a
ring<00:02:50.780> this<00:02:51.110> width<00:02:51.819> now<00:02:52.819> this<00:02:53.300> part<00:02:53.660> of<00:02:53.780> the

00:02:53.860 --> 00:02:53.870 
ring this width now this part of the

00:02:53.870 --> 00:02:56.470 
ring this width now this part of the
finger<00:02:54.230> down<00:02:54.470> at<00:02:54.709> the<00:02:54.800> bottom<00:02:55.270> that's<00:02:56.270> where

00:02:56.470 --> 00:02:56.480 
finger down at the bottom that's where

00:02:56.480 --> 00:02:58.780 
finger down at the bottom that's where
your<00:02:56.750> finger<00:02:57.110> is<00:02:57.260> the<00:02:57.410> smallest<00:02:57.770> when<00:02:58.670> you

00:02:58.780 --> 00:02:58.790 
your finger is the smallest when you

00:02:58.790 --> 00:03:02.410 
your finger is the smallest when you

00:03:02.410 --> 00:03:02.420 
have a really tiny narrow ring and it's

00:03:02.420 --> 00:03:04.540 
have a really tiny narrow ring and it's
just<00:03:02.870> gonna<00:03:03.020> nestle<00:03:03.530> in<00:03:03.709> that<00:03:03.890> little<00:03:04.160> spot

00:03:04.540 --> 00:03:04.550 
just gonna nestle in that little spot

00:03:04.550 --> 00:03:07.440 
just gonna nestle in that little spot
then<00:03:05.510> you<00:03:05.720> want<00:03:05.930> to<00:03:06.050> be<00:03:06.140> on<00:03:06.319> the<00:03:06.470> tight<00:03:06.800> side

00:03:07.440 --> 00:03:07.450 
then you want to be on the tight side

oops you can't see this okay I'm just

00:03:19.930 --> 00:03:23.080 
oops you can't see this okay I'm just
rocking<00:03:20.930> it<00:03:21.019> back<00:03:21.140> and<00:03:21.350> forth<00:03:21.640> I'm<00:03:22.640> thinking

00:03:23.080 --> 00:03:23.090 
rocking it back and forth I'm thinking

00:03:23.090 --> 00:03:27.430 
rocking it back and forth I'm thinking
to<00:03:23.180> myself<00:03:24.459> that<00:03:25.459> if<00:03:25.819> I<00:03:26.000> had<00:03:26.299> a<00:03:26.569> band<00:03:27.019> that<00:03:27.290> was

00:03:27.430 --> 00:03:27.440 
to myself that if I had a band that was

00:03:27.440 --> 00:03:30.610 
to myself that if I had a band that was
narrower<00:03:27.890> than<00:03:28.160> this<00:03:28.340> which<00:03:28.730> many<00:03:29.500> bottom<00:03:30.500> of

00:03:30.610 --> 00:03:30.620 
narrower than this which many bottom of

00:03:30.620 --> 00:03:33.640 
narrower than this which many bottom of
the<00:03:30.769> rings<00:03:31.010> are<00:03:31.730> narrower<00:03:32.209> than<00:03:32.480> this<00:03:32.690> I<00:03:32.989> think

00:03:33.640 --> 00:03:33.650 
the rings are narrower than this I think

00:03:33.650 --> 00:03:37.720 
the rings are narrower than this I think
that<00:03:34.549> I<00:03:34.580> would<00:03:34.819> love<00:03:35.239> this<00:03:35.630> size<00:03:35.959> if<00:03:36.519> it<00:03:37.519> was

00:03:37.720 --> 00:03:37.730 
that I would love this size if it was

00:03:37.730 --> 00:03:41.590 
that I would love this size if it was
wider<00:03:38.630> than<00:03:38.810> this<00:03:39.790> this<00:03:40.790> might<00:03:41.090> be<00:03:41.239> a<00:03:41.269> bit<00:03:41.450> much

00:03:41.590 --> 00:03:41.600 
wider than this this might be a bit much

00:03:41.600 --> 00:03:45.340 
wider than this this might be a bit much
okay<00:03:42.019> so<00:03:42.080> so<00:03:42.799> I'm<00:03:43.040> calling<00:03:43.340> myself<00:03:43.730> a<00:03:44.350> size

00:03:45.340 --> 00:03:45.350 
okay so so I'm calling myself a size

00:03:45.350 --> 00:03:47.830 
okay so so I'm calling myself a size
four<00:03:45.890> finger<00:03:46.370> size<00:03:46.610> now<00:03:47.330> let's<00:03:47.600> say<00:03:47.780> for
