00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.480
 well hello to all of you here and 

00:00:01.680 --> 00:00:04.950
 this morning we meet today for 

00:00:03.480 --> 00:00:06.930
 a very special video since it's 

00:00:04.950 --> 00:00:08.010
 simply a super quick sweat 

00:00:06.930 --> 00:00:09.750
 so I can have a lot of time to 

00:00:08.010 --> 00:00:11.040
 talk to you during this video you are 

00:00:09.750 --> 00:00:12.870
 a mom 80 seconds 

00:00:11.040 --> 00:00:14.190
 so I invite you to count from 

00:00:12.870 --> 00:00:16.890
 the time I'm going to be short but who 

00:00:14.190 --> 00:00:18.840
 so there he will not delay so you 

00:00:16.890 --> 00:00:21.420
 can watch his 80 seconds of exact 

00:00:18.840 --> 00:00:23.189
 I did not do it on purpose but 

00:00:21.420 --> 00:00:25.470
 Fortunately, Ben is 80 seconds 

00:00:23.189 --> 00:00:26.820
 so this is one of the fastest months 

00:00:25.470 --> 00:00:28.710
 as I have seen on youtube for 

00:00:26.820 --> 00:00:30.480
 the moment after there are Americans who 

00:00:28.710 --> 00:00:31.710
 realized a little better but hey that's 

00:00:30.480 --> 00:00:33.780
 just for a hatch while there you 

00:00:31.710 --> 00:00:35.250
 go see it's not really you're 

00:00:33.780 --> 00:00:38.010
 just years old at a speed 

00:00:35.250 --> 00:00:39.090
 so fast enough for little things 

00:00:38.010 --> 00:00:40.770
 you will tell yourself that I have a 

00:00:39.090 --> 00:00:42.870
 connection of sick or for those who 

00:00:40.770 --> 00:00:44.879
 would not be yet I have about 100 

00:00:42.870 --> 00:00:47.100
 king so it's just studio mode 

00:00:44.879 --> 00:00:49.140
 because just the word studio 

00:00:47.100 --> 00:00:50.910
 a bug a little bit you'll see 

00:00:49.140 --> 00:00:52.020
 the enemies you will see from eight 

00:00:50.910 --> 00:00:53.730
 markers for example on an enemy 

00:00:52.020 --> 00:00:56.250
 when in fact well it's a half 

00:00:53.730 --> 00:00:57.899
 time was shot on mac and his modes 

00:00:56.250 --> 00:01:00.000
 studio but also get through a 

00:00:57.899 --> 00:01:03.480
 or two windows and ben it's also my 

00:01:00.000 --> 00:01:05.760
 bath studio do not shout at ps3 hack 

00:01:03.480 --> 00:01:06.990
