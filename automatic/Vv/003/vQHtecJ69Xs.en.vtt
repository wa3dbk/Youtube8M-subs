00:05:19.850 --> 00:05:22.000 
to go to church every Sunday you guys
know<00:05:20.270> this<00:05:20.480> so<00:05:21.110> I<00:05:21.140> thought<00:05:21.530> that<00:05:21.740> this<00:05:21.830> would

00:05:22.000 --> 00:05:22.010 
know this so I thought that this would

00:05:22.010 --> 00:05:26.020 
know this so I thought that this would
be<00:05:22.070> a<00:05:22.160> great<00:05:22.640> just<00:05:23.150> modest<00:05:23.840> nice<00:05:24.580> formal<00:05:25.580> dress

00:05:26.020 --> 00:05:26.030 
be a great just modest nice formal dress

00:05:26.030 --> 00:05:28.690 
be a great just modest nice formal dress
for<00:05:26.390> church<00:05:26.620> the<00:05:27.620> bottom<00:05:27.980> of<00:05:28.130> it<00:05:28.250> is<00:05:28.430> a<00:05:28.460> little

00:05:28.690 --> 00:05:28.700 
for church the bottom of it is a little

00:05:28.700 --> 00:05:31.620 
for church the bottom of it is a little
bit<00:05:28.850> thicker<00:05:29.090> material<00:05:29.750> and<00:05:30.020> it<00:05:30.230> does<00:05:30.560> have<00:05:30.980> a

00:05:31.620 --> 00:05:31.630 
bit thicker material and it does have a

00:05:31.630 --> 00:05:34.210 
bit thicker material and it does have a
lining<00:05:32.630> so<00:05:33.050> it's<00:05:33.260> not<00:05:33.440> like<00:05:33.680> sheer

00:05:34.210 --> 00:05:34.220 
lining so it's not like sheer

00:05:34.220 --> 00:05:35.770 
lining so it's not like sheer
see-through<00:05:34.580> or<00:05:34.850> anything<00:05:35.120> and<00:05:35.480> this<00:05:35.570> fabric

00:05:35.770 --> 00:05:35.780 
see-through or anything and this fabric

00:05:35.780 --> 00:05:38.230 
see-through or anything and this fabric
is<00:05:36.050> actually<00:05:36.440> pretty<00:05:36.680> thick<00:05:37.040> so<00:05:37.610> I<00:05:37.640> do<00:05:37.820> like

00:05:38.230 --> 00:05:38.240 
is actually pretty thick so I do like

00:05:38.240 --> 00:05:41.080 
is actually pretty thick so I do like
that<00:05:38.650> because<00:05:39.650> then<00:05:39.830> it<00:05:40.040> won't<00:05:40.280> blow<00:05:40.669> up<00:05:40.880> in

00:05:41.080 --> 00:05:41.090 
that because then it won't blow up in

00:05:41.090 --> 00:05:42.550 
that because then it won't blow up in
the<00:05:41.180> wind<00:05:41.360> if<00:05:41.540> it's<00:05:41.690> kind<00:05:41.810> of<00:05:41.930> breezy<00:05:42.169> that<00:05:42.410> day

00:05:42.550 --> 00:05:42.560 
the wind if it's kind of breezy that day

00:05:42.560 --> 00:05:44.470 
the wind if it's kind of breezy that day
or<00:05:42.710> something<00:05:42.830> so<00:05:43.550> I<00:05:43.580> think<00:05:43.820> I'll<00:05:44.090> be<00:05:44.270> wearing

00:05:44.470 --> 00:05:44.480 
or something so I think I'll be wearing

00:05:44.480 --> 00:05:46.750 
or something so I think I'll be wearing
this<00:05:44.840> on<00:05:45.140> the<00:05:45.290> more<00:05:45.470> breezy<00:05:45.919> days<00:05:46.130> because<00:05:46.610> it

00:05:46.750 --> 00:05:46.760 
this on the more breezy days because it

00:05:46.760 --> 00:05:48.250 
this on the more breezy days because it
is<00:05:46.790> a<00:05:46.880> little<00:05:47.090> bit<00:05:47.270> thicker<00:05:47.480> material<00:05:48.080> so<00:05:48.230> I

00:05:48.250 --> 00:05:48.260 
is a little bit thicker material so I

00:05:48.260 --> 00:05:49.510 
is a little bit thicker material so I
can't<00:05:48.560> necessarily<00:05:48.650> wear<00:05:49.250> it<00:05:49.370> in<00:05:49.490> the

00:05:49.510 --> 00:05:49.520 
can't necessarily wear it in the

00:05:49.520 --> 00:05:52.090 
can't necessarily wear it in the
summertime<00:05:49.880> when<00:05:50.210> it's<00:05:50.330> scorching<00:05:51.169> hot<00:05:51.380> but

00:05:52.090 --> 00:05:52.100 
summertime when it's scorching hot but

00:05:52.100 --> 00:05:54.850 
summertime when it's scorching hot but
I'll<00:05:52.370> be<00:05:52.490> able<00:05:52.610> to<00:05:52.940> wear<00:05:53.120> it<00:05:53.380> when<00:05:54.380> it's<00:05:54.530> maybe

00:05:54.850 --> 00:05:54.860 
I'll be able to wear it when it's maybe

00:05:54.860 --> 00:05:56.020 
I'll be able to wear it when it's maybe
a<00:05:54.919> little<00:05:54.980> bit<00:05:55.190> breezy<00:05:55.370> and<00:05:55.669> I<00:05:55.730> don't<00:05:55.790> want<00:05:56.000> my

00:05:57.640 --> 00:05:57.650 
dress to fly up because this is a little
