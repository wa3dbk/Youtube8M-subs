we're here to talk about Bradford
White's<00:00:24.020> icon<00:00:24.710> system<00:00:25.250> and<00:00:25.730> this<00:00:25.820> is<00:00:25.970> a

00:00:25.990 --> 00:00:26.000 
White's icon system and this is a

00:00:26.000 --> 00:00:28.510 
White's icon system and this is a
completely<00:00:26.540> new<00:00:26.900> control<00:00:27.470> technology<00:00:28.250> that

00:00:28.510 --> 00:00:28.520 
completely new control technology that

00:00:28.520 --> 00:00:31.120 
completely new control technology that
will<00:00:28.640> be<00:00:28.990> integrated<00:00:29.990> across<00:00:30.260> the<00:00:30.619> range<00:00:30.860> of

00:00:31.120 --> 00:00:31.130 
will be integrated across the range of

00:00:31.130 --> 00:00:32.589 
will be integrated across the range of
Bradford<00:00:31.520> White's<00:00:31.730> residential<00:00:32.450> and

00:00:32.589 --> 00:00:32.599 
Bradford White's residential and

00:00:32.599 --> 00:00:34.080 
Bradford White's residential and
light-duty<00:00:32.780> commercial<00:00:33.440> products<00:00:33.830> and

00:00:34.080 --> 00:00:34.090 
light-duty commercial products and

00:00:34.090 --> 00:00:36.729 
light-duty commercial products and
obviously<00:00:35.090> it<00:00:35.600> looks<00:00:35.750> a<00:00:35.930> lot<00:00:36.080> different<00:00:36.110> from

00:00:36.729 --> 00:00:36.739 
obviously it looks a lot different from

00:00:36.739 --> 00:00:38.590 
obviously it looks a lot different from
standard<00:00:37.220> gas<00:00:37.580> valve<00:00:37.879> that<00:00:38.090> you're<00:00:38.239> used<00:00:38.480> to

00:00:38.590 --> 00:00:38.600 
standard gas valve that you're used to

00:00:38.600 --> 00:00:41.020 
standard gas valve that you're used to
but<00:00:39.350> it<00:00:39.470> goes<00:00:39.620> beyond<00:00:39.980> the<00:00:40.129> looks<00:00:40.370> Jason

00:00:41.020 --> 00:00:41.030 
but it goes beyond the looks Jason

00:00:41.030 --> 00:00:42.939 
but it goes beyond the looks Jason
there's<00:00:41.239> a<00:00:41.300> lot<00:00:41.900> of<00:00:42.080> functionality<00:00:42.800> that's

00:00:42.939 --> 00:00:42.949 
there's a lot of functionality that's

00:00:42.949 --> 00:00:44.350 
there's a lot of functionality that's
built<00:00:43.010> into<00:00:43.430> this<00:00:43.550> it's<00:00:44.059> really<00:00:44.300> an

00:00:44.350 --> 00:00:44.360 
built into this it's really an

00:00:44.360 --> 00:00:46.390 
built into this it's really an
electronic<00:00:44.870> valve<00:00:45.110> but<00:00:45.559> it<00:00:45.800> doesn't<00:00:46.280> need

00:00:46.390 --> 00:00:46.400 
electronic valve but it doesn't need

00:00:46.400 --> 00:00:47.890 
electronic valve but it doesn't need
external<00:00:46.699> electricity<00:00:47.150> how<00:00:47.449> does<00:00:47.600> that<00:00:47.750> work

00:00:47.890 --> 00:00:47.900 
external electricity how does that work

00:00:47.900 --> 00:00:49.990 
external electricity how does that work
no<00:00:48.140> it<00:00:48.290> does<00:00:48.470> not<00:00:48.589> it<00:00:48.650> works<00:00:49.430> with<00:00:49.580> Bradford

00:00:49.990 --> 00:00:50.000 
no it does not it works with Bradford

00:00:50.000 --> 00:00:52.990 
no it does not it works with Bradford
White's<00:00:50.210> proven<00:00:50.870> millivolt<00:00:51.470> technology<00:00:52.040> and

00:00:52.990 --> 00:00:53.000 
White's proven millivolt technology and

00:00:53.000 --> 00:00:55.180 
White's proven millivolt technology and
how<00:00:53.150> that<00:00:53.390> works<00:00:53.659> is<00:00:53.930> a<00:00:53.989> thermal<00:00:54.710> thermal

00:00:55.180 --> 00:00:55.190 
how that works is a thermal thermal

00:00:55.190 --> 00:00:56.920 
how that works is a thermal thermal
pilot<00:00:55.610> converts<00:00:56.030> heat<00:00:56.330> energy<00:00:56.540> from<00:00:56.750> the

00:00:56.920 --> 00:00:56.930 
pilot converts heat energy from the

00:00:56.930 --> 00:00:59.350 
pilot converts heat energy from the
pilot<00:00:57.320> flame<00:00:57.500> into<00:00:58.250> electrical<00:00:59.000> energy<00:00:59.150> to

00:00:59.350 --> 00:00:59.360 
pilot flame into electrical energy to

00:00:59.360 --> 00:01:01.299 
pilot flame into electrical energy to
work<00:00:59.570> the<00:00:59.690> gas<00:00:59.870> valve<00:01:00.110> so<00:01:00.350> no<00:01:00.860> external

00:01:01.299 --> 00:01:01.309 
work the gas valve so no external

00:01:01.309 --> 00:01:02.950 
work the gas valve so no external
electricity<00:01:01.640> is<00:01:01.940> required<00:01:02.239> so<00:01:02.540> similar<00:01:02.900> to

00:01:02.950 --> 00:01:02.960 
electricity is required so similar to

00:01:02.960 --> 00:01:03.969 
electricity is required so similar to
what<00:01:03.049> we've<00:01:03.170> done<00:01:03.350> on<00:01:03.470> the<00:01:03.650> millimole

00:01:03.969 --> 00:01:03.979 
what we've done on the millimole

00:01:03.979 --> 00:01:04.990 
what we've done on the millimole
commercial<00:01:04.430> and<00:01:04.610> done<00:01:04.699> by<00:01:04.790> the<00:01:04.879> other

with this technology yep and it's got

00:01:09.140 --> 00:01:11.110 
with this technology yep and it's got
some<00:01:09.320> sophisticated<00:01:09.830> algorithms<00:01:10.460> in<00:01:10.610> it<00:01:10.700> that

00:01:11.110 --> 00:01:11.120 
some sophisticated algorithms in it that

00:01:11.120 --> 00:01:13.390 
some sophisticated algorithms in it that
help<00:01:11.330> us<00:01:11.590> actually<00:01:12.590> get<00:01:12.710> better<00:01:12.799> performance

00:01:13.390 --> 00:01:13.400 
help us actually get better performance

00:01:13.400 --> 00:01:14.740 
help us actually get better performance

deliveries and tighter temperature
differentials<00:01:17.270> and<00:01:18.200> what<00:01:18.380> I<00:01:18.410> mean<00:01:18.590> by<00:01:18.710> tire

00:01:19.000 --> 00:01:19.010 
differentials and what I mean by tire

00:01:19.010 --> 00:01:21.070 
differentials and what I mean by tire
temperature<00:01:19.490> differential<00:01:20.060> is<00:01:20.270> it<00:01:20.840> allows

00:01:21.070 --> 00:01:21.080 
temperature differential is it allows

00:01:21.080 --> 00:01:22.840 
temperature differential is it allows
for<00:01:21.290> water<00:01:21.560> inside<00:01:21.980> the<00:01:22.130> tank<00:01:22.310> to<00:01:22.400> be<00:01:22.460> heated

00:01:22.840 --> 00:01:22.850 
for water inside the tank to be heated

00:01:22.850 --> 00:01:24.700 
for water inside the tank to be heated
closer<00:01:23.120> to<00:01:23.660> what<00:01:23.780> you<00:01:23.870> set<00:01:24.050> the<00:01:24.140> gas<00:01:24.290> valve<00:01:24.530> out

00:01:24.700 --> 00:01:24.710 
closer to what you set the gas valve out

00:01:24.710 --> 00:01:26.710 
closer to what you set the gas valve out
to<00:01:24.860> so<00:01:25.310> no<00:01:25.640> more<00:01:25.820> morning<00:01:26.150> sickness<00:01:26.360> when<00:01:26.660> you

00:01:26.710 --> 00:01:26.720 
to so no more morning sickness when you

00:01:26.720 --> 00:01:27.730 
to so no more morning sickness when you
wake<00:01:26.870> up<00:01:26.900> and<00:01:27.170> you<00:01:27.260> have<00:01:27.290> a<00:01:27.380> cold<00:01:27.590> shower

00:01:27.730 --> 00:01:27.740 
wake up and you have a cold shower

00:01:27.740 --> 00:01:29.680 
wake up and you have a cold shower
correct<00:01:28.250> wow<00:01:28.580> that's<00:01:28.820> a<00:01:28.910> huge<00:01:29.030> benefit<00:01:29.540> to<00:01:29.570> the

00:01:29.680 --> 00:01:29.690 
correct wow that's a huge benefit to the

00:01:29.690 --> 00:01:31.570 
correct wow that's a huge benefit to the
consumer<00:01:30.170> now<00:01:30.650> let's<00:01:30.830> talk<00:01:30.920> about<00:01:31.070> how<00:01:31.400> this

00:01:31.570 --> 00:01:31.580 
consumer now let's talk about how this

00:01:31.580 --> 00:01:33.940 
consumer now let's talk about how this
helps<00:01:31.850> the<00:01:31.940> contractor<00:01:32.770> we've<00:01:33.770> integrated

00:01:33.940 --> 00:01:33.950 
helps the contractor we've integrated

00:01:33.950 --> 00:01:35.920 
helps the contractor we've integrated
the<00:01:34.280> piezo<00:01:34.550> igniter<00:01:34.910> what<00:01:35.300> used<00:01:35.570> to<00:01:35.630> be<00:01:35.690> on<00:01:35.840> the

00:01:35.920 --> 00:01:35.930 
the piezo igniter what used to be on the

00:01:35.930 --> 00:01:37.540 
the piezo igniter what used to be on the
side<00:01:36.110> here<00:01:36.380> it's<00:01:36.500> all<00:01:36.650> integrated<00:01:36.860> in<00:01:37.220> here<00:01:37.430> so

00:01:37.540 --> 00:01:37.550 
side here it's all integrated in here so

00:01:37.550 --> 00:01:38.950 
side here it's all integrated in here so
you<00:01:37.610> still<00:01:37.820> have<00:01:37.940> to<00:01:38.030> use<00:01:38.180> that<00:01:38.390> to<00:01:38.540> ignite<00:01:38.810> it

00:01:38.950 --> 00:01:38.960 
you still have to use that to ignite it

00:01:38.960 --> 00:01:40.990 
you still have to use that to ignite it
yep<00:01:39.170> but<00:01:39.860> we<00:01:39.980> have<00:01:40.100> a<00:01:40.130> status<00:01:40.520> indicator<00:01:40.640> what

00:01:40.990 --> 00:01:41.000 
yep but we have a status indicator what

00:01:41.000 --> 00:01:42.520 
yep but we have a status indicator what
does<00:01:41.090> that<00:01:41.120> tell<00:01:41.390> us<00:01:41.420> it<00:01:41.990> assists<00:01:42.440> in

00:01:42.520 --> 00:01:42.530 
does that tell us it assists in

00:01:42.530 --> 00:01:45.430 
does that tell us it assists in
troubleshooting<00:01:43.720> startup<00:01:44.720> procedure<00:01:45.050> and

00:01:45.430 --> 00:01:45.440 
troubleshooting startup procedure and

00:01:45.440 --> 00:01:47.410 
troubleshooting startup procedure and
diagnostic<00:01:46.280> codes<00:01:46.490> so<00:01:46.790> it<00:01:46.970> saves<00:01:47.210> the

00:01:47.410 --> 00:01:47.420 
diagnostic codes so it saves the

00:01:47.420 --> 00:01:50.110 
diagnostic codes so it saves the
Installer<00:01:47.890> a<00:01:48.890> lot<00:01:49.220> of<00:01:49.370> installation<00:01:49.940> time

00:01:50.110 --> 00:01:50.120 
Installer a lot of installation time

00:01:50.120 --> 00:01:51.940 
Installer a lot of installation time
okay<00:01:50.600> and<00:01:50.810> helps<00:01:51.110> them<00:01:51.200> if<00:01:51.380> there's<00:01:51.560> ever<00:01:51.770> an

00:01:51.940 --> 00:01:51.950 
okay and helps them if there's ever an

00:01:51.950 --> 00:01:54.310 
okay and helps them if there's ever an
issue<00:01:52.240> with<00:01:53.240> Diagnostics<00:01:53.900> and<00:01:53.990> give<00:01:54.080> me<00:01:54.170> some

00:01:54.310 --> 00:01:54.320 
issue with Diagnostics and give me some

00:01:54.320 --> 00:01:55.990 
issue with Diagnostics and give me some
more<00:01:54.440> time<00:01:54.590> and<00:01:54.890> it'll<00:01:55.400> actually<00:01:55.550> tell<00:01:55.880> you

00:01:55.990 --> 00:01:56.000 
more time and it'll actually tell you

00:01:56.000 --> 00:01:58.920 
more time and it'll actually tell you
when<00:01:56.150> the<00:01:56.240> pilots<00:01:56.600> on<00:01:56.750> yep<00:01:57.110> the<00:01:57.350> green<00:01:58.070> LED

00:01:58.920 --> 00:01:58.930 
when the pilots on yep the green LED

00:01:58.930 --> 00:02:01.600 
when the pilots on yep the green LED
display<00:01:59.930> starts<00:02:00.200> blinking<00:02:00.380> when<00:02:00.830> the<00:02:01.100> pile<00:02:01.430> is

00:02:01.600 --> 00:02:01.610 
display starts blinking when the pile is

00:02:01.610 --> 00:02:04.120 
display starts blinking when the pile is
lit<00:02:01.790> okay<00:02:02.390> that's<00:02:02.780> a<00:02:02.900> great<00:02:02.990> feature<00:02:03.260> too<00:02:03.560> now

00:02:04.120 --> 00:02:04.130 
lit okay that's a great feature too now

00:02:04.130 --> 00:02:05.950 
lit okay that's a great feature too now
something<00:02:05.060> that's<00:02:05.090> different<00:02:05.420> about<00:02:05.570> this

00:02:05.950 --> 00:02:05.960 
something that's different about this

00:02:05.960 --> 00:02:07.690 
something that's different about this
valve<00:02:06.260> versus<00:02:06.680> a<00:02:06.710> standard<00:02:07.340> water<00:02:07.460> heater

00:02:07.690 --> 00:02:07.700 
valve versus a standard water heater

00:02:07.700 --> 00:02:09.279 
valve versus a standard water heater
valve<00:02:07.909> is<00:02:08.119> it<00:02:08.330> actually<00:02:08.629> separates<00:02:08.989> and<00:02:09.200> this

00:02:09.279 --> 00:02:09.289 
valve is it actually separates and this

00:02:09.289 --> 00:02:11.110 
valve is it actually separates and this
actually<00:02:09.619> stays<00:02:09.860> in<00:02:10.039> the<00:02:10.280> tank<00:02:10.550> this<00:02:10.879> does

00:02:11.110 --> 00:02:11.120 
actually stays in the tank this does

00:02:11.120 --> 00:02:12.910 
actually stays in the tank this does
stay<00:02:11.420> inside<00:02:11.810> the<00:02:11.959> tank<00:02:12.200> which<00:02:12.620> means<00:02:12.830> you

00:02:12.910 --> 00:02:12.920 
stay inside the tank which means you

00:02:12.920 --> 00:02:14.410 
stay inside the tank which means you
don't<00:02:13.010> have<00:02:13.099> to<00:02:13.220> drain<00:02:13.430> the<00:02:13.580> tank<00:02:13.610> to<00:02:14.060> replace

00:02:14.410 --> 00:02:14.420 
don't have to drain the tank to replace

00:02:14.420 --> 00:02:15.430 
don't have to drain the tank to replace
the<00:02:14.599> valve<00:02:14.780> or<00:02:14.930> remember<00:02:15.200> the<00:02:15.230> Bell

00:02:15.430 --> 00:02:15.440 
the valve or remember the Bell

00:02:15.440 --> 00:02:17.259 
the valve or remember the Bell
absolutely<00:02:15.950> not<00:02:16.129> another<00:02:16.370> huge<00:02:16.700> time-saving

00:02:17.259 --> 00:02:17.269 
absolutely not another huge time-saving

00:02:17.269 --> 00:02:20.320

00:02:53.750 --> 00:02:56.230 
the built-in piezo igniter and ensure
that<00:02:53.900> you<00:02:53.990> have<00:02:54.020> a<00:02:54.170> pilot<00:02:54.560> flame<00:02:54.800> and<00:02:55.120> you<00:02:56.120> have

00:02:56.230 --> 00:02:56.240 
that you have a pilot flame and you have

00:02:56.240 --> 00:02:58.750 
that you have a pilot flame and you have
to<00:02:56.360> hold<00:02:56.540> the<00:02:56.780> pilot<00:02:57.350> knob<00:02:57.530> down<00:02:57.920> for<00:02:58.550> as<00:02:58.640> much

00:02:58.750 --> 00:02:58.760 
to hold the pilot knob down for as much

as 90 seconds

00:02:59.870 --> 00:03:02.620 
as 90 seconds
but<00:03:00.410> unlike<00:03:00.710> a<00:03:01.010> current<00:03:01.610> control<00:03:02.090> system<00:03:02.510> you

00:03:02.620 --> 00:03:02.630 
but unlike a current control system you

00:03:02.630 --> 00:03:04.060 
but unlike a current control system you
don't<00:03:02.780> have<00:03:02.930> to<00:03:03.050> get<00:03:03.170> down<00:03:03.320> and<00:03:03.560> your<00:03:03.920> knees

00:03:04.060 --> 00:03:04.070 
don't have to get down and your knees

00:03:04.070 --> 00:03:06.180 
don't have to get down and your knees
and<00:03:04.310> watch<00:03:04.460> the<00:03:04.700> flame<00:03:04.970> for<00:03:05.510> the<00:03:05.570> entire<00:03:05.840> time

00:03:06.180 --> 00:03:06.190 
and watch the flame for the entire time

00:03:06.190 --> 00:03:08.710 
and watch the flame for the entire time
you<00:03:07.190> can<00:03:07.340> simply<00:03:07.670> look<00:03:07.820> at<00:03:07.940> the<00:03:08.060> green<00:03:08.270> LED

00:03:08.710 --> 00:03:08.720 
you can simply look at the green LED

00:03:08.720 --> 00:03:10.240 
you can simply look at the green LED
light<00:03:08.960> and<00:03:08.990> that's<00:03:09.320> your<00:03:09.500> indicator<00:03:09.920> when<00:03:10.160> you

00:03:10.240 --> 00:03:10.250 
light and that's your indicator when you

00:03:10.250 --> 00:03:12.550 
light and that's your indicator when you
have<00:03:10.370> a<00:03:10.400> pilot<00:03:10.910> when<00:03:11.360> we<00:03:11.450> see<00:03:11.630> that<00:03:11.780> green<00:03:12.050> LED

00:03:12.550 --> 00:03:12.560 
have a pilot when we see that green LED

00:03:12.560 --> 00:03:14.590 
have a pilot when we see that green LED
light<00:03:12.890> with<00:03:13.370> one<00:03:13.640> flash<00:03:13.970> followed<00:03:14.300> by<00:03:14.570> a

00:03:14.590 --> 00:03:14.600

00:03:14.600 --> 00:03:16.780 
light with one flash followed by a
three-second<00:03:15.170> pause<00:03:15.200> we<00:03:16.010> know<00:03:16.220> we<00:03:16.370> have<00:03:16.550> a

00:03:16.780 --> 00:03:16.790 
three-second pause we know we have a

00:03:16.790 --> 00:03:20.170 
three-second pause we know we have a
positive<00:03:17.330> pilot<00:03:17.930> flame<00:03:18.170> and<00:03:18.790> we<00:03:19.790> have<00:03:19.970> that

00:03:20.170 --> 00:03:20.180 
positive pilot flame and we have that

00:03:20.180 --> 00:03:22.990 
positive pilot flame and we have that
now<00:03:20.530> you<00:03:21.530> can<00:03:21.710> let<00:03:21.830> go<00:03:22.070> of<00:03:22.340> the<00:03:22.490> knob<00:03:22.640> at<00:03:22.850> that

00:03:22.990 --> 00:03:23.000 
now you can let go of the knob at that

00:03:23.000 --> 00:03:25.150 
now you can let go of the knob at that
point<00:03:23.300> simply<00:03:24.140> turn<00:03:24.530> it<00:03:24.650> to<00:03:24.770> the<00:03:24.860> desired

00:03:25.150 --> 00:03:25.160 
point simply turn it to the desired

00:03:25.160 --> 00:03:28.330 
point simply turn it to the desired
temperature<00:03:26.680> and<00:03:27.680> you'll<00:03:27.830> have<00:03:27.950> main<00:03:28.130> burner

00:03:28.330 --> 00:03:28.340 
temperature and you'll have main burner

00:03:28.340 --> 00:03:29.890 
temperature and you'll have main burner
ignition<00:03:28.820> when<00:03:28.940> the<00:03:29.030> thermostat<00:03:29.270> calls<00:03:29.690> for

00:03:43.309 --> 00:03:43.319 
talked about the exciting features and

00:03:43.319 --> 00:03:45.230 
talked about the exciting features and
benefits<00:03:43.740> and<00:03:43.950> how<00:03:44.250> advanced<00:03:44.730> the<00:03:44.819> icon

00:03:45.230 --> 00:03:45.240 
benefits and how advanced the icon

00:03:45.240 --> 00:03:47.720 
benefits and how advanced the icon
system<00:03:45.630> really<00:03:45.750> is<00:03:45.930> but<00:03:46.280> another<00:03:47.280> key<00:03:47.520> factor

00:03:47.720 --> 00:03:47.730 
system really is but another key factor

00:03:47.730 --> 00:03:49.130 
system really is but another key factor
in<00:03:48.000> the<00:03:48.060> design<00:03:48.180> was<00:03:48.540> to<00:03:48.630> make<00:03:48.750> sure<00:03:48.870> it<00:03:48.990> was

00:03:49.130 --> 00:03:49.140 
in the design was to make sure it was

00:03:49.140 --> 00:03:51.740 
in the design was to make sure it was
strong<00:03:49.500> yep<00:03:49.920> and<00:03:50.130> can<00:03:51.000> you<00:03:51.090> tell<00:03:51.240> us<00:03:51.270> what<00:03:51.569> the

00:03:51.740 --> 00:03:51.750 
strong yep and can you tell us what the

00:03:51.750 --> 00:03:54.530 
strong yep and can you tell us what the
material<00:03:52.200> is<00:03:52.400> that<00:03:53.400> that<00:03:53.640> actually<00:03:53.850> goes<00:03:54.209> into

00:03:54.530 --> 00:03:54.540 
material is that that actually goes into

00:03:54.540 --> 00:03:56.030 
material is that that actually goes into
the<00:03:54.660> tank<00:03:54.810> that<00:03:55.020> screws<00:03:55.260> into<00:03:55.470> the<00:03:55.650> tank

00:03:56.030 --> 00:03:56.040 
the tank that screws into the tank

00:03:56.040 --> 00:03:58.280 
the tank that screws into the tank
yeah<00:03:56.220> the<00:03:56.400> correct<00:03:57.390> the<00:03:57.569> thermal<00:03:57.959> well<00:03:58.080> it's

00:03:58.280 --> 00:03:58.290 
yeah the correct the thermal well it's

00:03:58.290 --> 00:03:59.809 
yeah the correct the thermal well it's
made<00:03:58.470> out<00:03:58.650> of<00:03:58.800> an<00:03:58.920> advanced<00:03:59.400> polymer

00:03:59.809 --> 00:03:59.819 
made out of an advanced polymer

00:03:59.819 --> 00:04:02.449 
made out of an advanced polymer
composite<00:04:00.360> so<00:04:01.230> it's<00:04:01.380> really<00:04:01.560> strong<00:04:01.890> really

00:04:02.449 --> 00:04:02.459 
composite so it's really strong really

00:04:02.459 --> 00:04:05.809 
composite so it's really strong really
durable<00:04:02.840> how<00:04:03.840> strong<00:04:04.110> is<00:04:04.260> it<00:04:04.290> well<00:04:04.680> upwards<00:04:05.640> to

00:04:05.809 --> 00:04:05.819 
durable how strong is it well upwards to

00:04:05.819 --> 00:04:08.570 
durable how strong is it well upwards to
600<00:04:06.330> pounds<00:04:06.620> 600<00:04:07.620> pounds<00:04:07.920> yeah

00:04:08.570 --> 00:04:08.580 
600 pounds 600 pounds yeah

00:04:08.580 --> 00:04:10.460 
600 pounds 600 pounds yeah
so<00:04:08.790> you're<00:04:08.940> saying<00:04:09.120> 600<00:04:09.570> pounds<00:04:09.930> can<00:04:10.110> can

00:04:10.460 --> 00:04:10.470 
so you're saying 600 pounds can can

00:04:10.470 --> 00:04:12.410 
so you're saying 600 pounds can can
stand<00:04:10.739> on<00:04:10.890> this<00:04:11.040> yeah<00:04:11.220> absolutely<00:04:11.459> that's

00:04:12.410 --> 00:04:12.420 
stand on this yeah absolutely that's

00:04:12.420 --> 00:04:13.970 
stand on this yeah absolutely that's
pretty<00:04:12.690> strong<00:04:12.870> I'm<00:04:13.380> not<00:04:13.560> sure<00:04:13.709> I<00:04:13.739> really

00:04:13.970 --> 00:04:13.980 
pretty strong I'm not sure I really

00:04:13.980 --> 00:04:15.979 
pretty strong I'm not sure I really
believe<00:04:14.220> that<00:04:14.250> but<00:04:14.820> I<00:04:15.120> know<00:04:15.720> that<00:04:15.840> our

00:04:15.979 --> 00:04:15.989 
believe that but I know that our

00:04:15.989 --> 00:04:18.289 
believe that but I know that our
engineers<00:04:16.470> came<00:04:16.739> up<00:04:16.769> with<00:04:17.100> a<00:04:17.130> test<00:04:17.640> to<00:04:18.150> prove

00:04:18.289 --> 00:04:18.299 
engineers came up with a test to prove

00:04:18.299 --> 00:04:21.890

00:04:54.980 --> 00:04:54.990 
now when we did this in the engineering

00:04:54.990 --> 00:04:57.920 
now when we did this in the engineering
and<00:04:55.200> we<00:04:55.260> took<00:04:55.440> it<00:04:55.500> to<00:04:55.650> the<00:04:55.770> stress<00:04:56.100> level<00:04:56.930> where

00:04:57.920 --> 00:04:57.930 
and we took it to the stress level where

00:04:57.930 --> 00:04:59.719 
and we took it to the stress level where
there<00:04:58.080> was<00:04:58.169> actually<00:04:58.500> a<00:04:58.530> failure<00:04:58.860> the<00:04:59.490> failure

00:04:59.719 --> 00:04:59.729 
there was actually a failure the failure

00:04:59.729 --> 00:05:01.940 
there was actually a failure the failure
was<00:05:00.060> in<00:05:00.210> the<00:05:00.360> tank<00:05:00.720> yep<00:05:01.110> as<00:05:01.260> I<00:05:01.410> understand<00:05:01.860> it

00:05:01.940 --> 00:05:01.950 
was in the tank yep as I understand it

00:05:01.950 --> 00:05:04.100 
was in the tank yep as I understand it
yep<00:05:02.130> not<00:05:02.280> a<00:05:02.340> super<00:05:02.640> oil<00:05:02.669> this<00:05:03.360> material<00:05:04.020> is

00:05:04.100 --> 00:05:04.110 
yep not a super oil this material is

00:05:04.110 --> 00:05:05.510 
yep not a super oil this material is
actually<00:05:04.229> stronger<00:05:04.919> than<00:05:04.950> the<00:05:05.100> metal<00:05:05.400> in<00:05:05.490> the

00:05:05.510 --> 00:05:05.520 
actually stronger than the metal in the

00:05:05.520 --> 00:05:08.630 
actually stronger than the metal in the
tank<00:05:06.050> absolutely<00:05:07.050> amazing<00:05:07.680> so<00:05:07.710> the<00:05:08.220> icon
