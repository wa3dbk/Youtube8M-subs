00:00:01.070 --> 00:00:08.040
 I leave the terminal, we are back to 

00:00:04.740 --> 00:00:11.580
 the 90 with antenna and everything we have 

00:00:08.040 --> 00:00:13.259
 here is the lg and 2 but first of all 

00:00:11.580 --> 00:00:15.509
 highlight that this version only 

00:00:13.259 --> 00:00:17.220
 will come good to the Asian market the 

00:00:15.509 --> 00:00:18.630
 version with the antenna this is not the 

00:00:17.220 --> 00:00:21.270
 we will have in Europe is a shame because 

00:00:18.630 --> 00:00:23.100
 We wanted to go back there with the antennas 

00:00:21.270 --> 00:00:25.170
 Street but it seems that for now no 

00:00:23.100 --> 00:00:27.390
 will be I wonder if really how much 

00:00:25.170 --> 00:00:30.150
 will improve the reception of those if you want 

00:00:27.390 --> 00:00:32.160
 I 'll see if it really is something that 

00:00:30.150 --> 00:00:34.380
 It attracts a lot of attention and it makes a 

00:00:32.160 --> 00:00:35.820
 little to the time of the 90s will improve us 

00:00:34.380 --> 00:00:37.980
 especially the radio we will not have to 

00:00:35.820 --> 00:00:40.200
 put on the headphones and we can 

00:00:37.980 --> 00:00:41.340
 and we could go with the radio plugged in 

00:00:40.200 --> 00:00:42.809
 down the street without needing 

00:00:41.340 --> 00:00:45.059
 headphones and that we would have the antenna 

00:00:42.809 --> 00:00:47.879
 good we started talking about this mobile 

00:00:45.059 --> 00:00:50.430
 and good is the successor let's say to 

00:00:47.879 --> 00:00:52.680
 alfredo let's say but in more version 

00:00:50.430 --> 00:00:54.120
 fablet speak the whole world 

00:00:52.680 --> 00:00:56.280
 the truth is that good brings everything 

00:00:54.120 --> 00:00:58.530
 good that brings this mobile with improvements 

00:00:56.280 --> 00:00:59.699
 that really are very interesting good 

00:00:58.530 --> 00:01:01.770
 Above all, they highlighted how 

00:00:59.699 --> 00:01:02.510
 specifications first of all 5.9 

00:01:01.770 --> 00:01:05.720
 inches 

00:01:02.510 --> 00:01:07.100
 full hd resolution of 1920 x 1080 by 

00:01:05.720 --> 00:01:09.350
 another side we also have the 3 

00:01:07.100 --> 00:01:10.759
 gigabytes of RAM memory path of rigor is 

00:01:09.350 --> 00:01:13.009
 something since it seems that it is 

00:01:10.759 --> 00:01:16.040
 scandalizing on the other hand too 

00:01:13.009 --> 00:01:18.259
 android 4.4 maybe the latest version already 

00:01:16.040 --> 00:01:20.840
 as expected and also 

00:01:18.259 --> 00:01:23.030
 download the 3200 milliamperes of 

00:01:20.840 --> 00:01:24.530
 batteries also as is the case with 

00:01:23.030 --> 00:01:27.680
 zeta 2 well in this case we also have 

00:01:24.530 --> 00:01:30.350
 3200 battery campers if the truth is 

00:01:27.680 --> 00:01:32.659
 that the mobile tim is really fine 

00:01:30.350 --> 00:01:35.119
 and also brings interesting improvements in 

00:01:32.659 --> 00:01:36.950
 the camera in effect are 13 megapixels 

00:01:35.119 --> 00:01:38.750
 of resolution but for what we 

00:01:36.950 --> 00:01:40.369
 our camera says perhaps the one that 

00:01:38.750 --> 00:01:41.539
 we have in the back of the 

00:01:40.369 --> 00:01:43.490
 camera, he told us that the 

00:01:41.539 --> 00:01:45.200
 stabilizer has been greatly improved and 

00:01:43.490 --> 00:01:47.119
 that this camera is quite good 

00:01:45.200 --> 00:01:50.630
 besides something very interesting that is 

00:01:47.119 --> 00:01:53.720
 that the photographs can be made with 

00:01:50.630 --> 00:01:56.840
 a good one with a very interesting option 

00:01:53.720 --> 00:01:59.210
 that today I'm going to mind 

00:01:56.840 --> 00:02:01.520
 is to focus on the points 

00:01:59.210 --> 00:02:04.539
 after having taken something like the 

00:02:01.520 --> 00:02:09.259
 camera liters will be aware but 

00:02:04.539 --> 00:02:11.730
 punctual that came in which for example 

00:02:09.259 --> 00:02:14.519
 we do not have signing 

00:02:11.730 --> 00:02:16.860
 if you take the picture and we have here 

00:02:14.519 --> 00:02:19.980
 man in the foreground we could look 

00:02:16.860 --> 00:02:24.000
 the plane in the back that's in 

00:02:19.980 --> 00:02:27.830
 the part of if he did not wrong so 

00:02:24.000 --> 00:02:32.870
 and we had more children was like that 

00:02:27.830 --> 00:02:35.000
 and then we take the picture 

00:02:32.870 --> 00:02:36.920
 let's hope we do not give ourselves for rights 

00:02:35.000 --> 00:02:39.060
 of image the Japanese these that 

00:02:36.920 --> 00:02:42.959
 we have there behind me 

00:02:39.060 --> 00:02:45.739
 here we can modify to see where 

00:02:42.959 --> 00:02:45.739
 focus the photo 

00:02:46.030 --> 00:02:52.610
 it's a very interesting very eye-catching mode 

00:02:49.580 --> 00:02:53.990
 in this finished in this case good 

00:02:52.610 --> 00:02:56.510
 then we will have to try it with more 

00:02:53.990 --> 00:02:58.640
 rigor but good to show it a little 

00:02:56.510 --> 00:03:00.440
 and it's really quite interesting 

00:02:58.640 --> 00:03:02.240
 option that was expected in the mobiles and 

00:03:00.440 --> 00:03:04.340
 that is finally arriving do not be 

00:03:02.240 --> 00:03:07.010
 also commented on another series of 

00:03:04.340 --> 00:03:08.990
 improvements and functionalities as per 

00:03:07.010 --> 00:03:10.850
 example is what you see here that serves 

00:03:08.990 --> 00:03:12.740
 for good to rather reduce the 

00:03:10.850 --> 00:03:14.960
 screen and adjust it to the size of manuel 

00:03:12.740 --> 00:03:16.670
 what we have is if we are not pau 

00:03:14.960 --> 00:03:18.260
 Gasol, it will be very good for us to have 

00:03:16.670 --> 00:03:19.850
 is this option to be able to handle the 

00:03:18.260 --> 00:03:21.530
 phone showing in these sizes of 

00:03:19.850 --> 00:03:23.090
 mobile is really useful more than anything 

00:03:21.530 --> 00:03:24.860
 to be able to type with the keyboard and 

00:03:23.090 --> 00:03:27.200
 others and on top you can move around 

00:03:24.860 --> 00:03:29.030
 the screen is to say we lose a bit of 

00:03:27.200 --> 00:03:30.830
 screen that is the one to this mobile but 

00:03:29.030 --> 00:03:34.490
 well it is also a very functionality 

00:03:30.830 --> 00:03:36.620
 interesting on the side there was something more 

00:03:34.490 --> 00:03:38.300
 to talk about software we have already 

00:03:36.620 --> 00:03:40.220
 commented on all the software, wait 

00:03:38.300 --> 00:03:42.350
 will not let me out now let's talk a little 

00:03:40.220 --> 00:03:46.190
 back from the hardware and what are we going to 

00:03:42.350 --> 00:03:48.170
 show here the same thing has on the axis 

00:03:46.190 --> 00:03:53.750
 the backside that apparently for 

00:03:48.170 --> 00:03:56.090
 this practical but a little contact 

00:03:53.750 --> 00:03:58.760
 it slides so much is that this one is 

00:03:56.090 --> 00:04:01.940
 pretty good as the back button of 

00:03:58.760 --> 00:04:04.250
 unlocking that also then we have the 

00:04:01.940 --> 00:04:07.130
 as we discussed in the g2 mini the 

00:04:04.250 --> 00:04:09.200
 author mode then to unlock the 

00:04:07.130 --> 00:04:11.000
 terminal, not only with double click 

00:04:09.200 --> 00:04:12.320
 but also with codes on screen 

00:04:11.000 --> 00:04:14.210
 exact branch of the ground because 

00:04:12.320 --> 00:04:16.010
 it is certainly the double blow that 

00:04:14.210 --> 00:04:17.390
 it seems much simpler but good 

00:04:16.010 --> 00:04:19.820
 they always want years old piebald images 

00:04:17.390 --> 00:04:22.010
 maybe they're messing a little and good 

00:04:19.820 --> 00:04:23.270
 I think that in broad strokes this is 

00:04:22.010 --> 00:04:25.700
 everything is a terminal that we do not know 

00:04:23.270 --> 00:04:27.380
 quite a bit of attention for the size and 

00:04:25.700 --> 00:04:28.880
 I believe well more more is also for 

00:04:27.380 --> 00:04:30.890
 the antenna that although not get to Europe 

00:04:28.880 --> 00:04:32.420
 we liked it very much considering 

00:04:30.890 --> 00:04:34.550
 that is almost six inches the truth 

00:04:32.420 --> 00:04:36.590
 is that it is a mobile that is quite 

00:04:34.550 --> 00:04:37.670
 well I do not see it that big and I think 

00:04:36.590 --> 00:04:39.470
 very successful 

00:04:37.670 --> 00:04:40.940
 so good nothing more than I can 

00:04:39.470 --> 00:04:43.030
 comment for now we will analyze 

00:04:40.940 --> 00:04:44.830
 then more carefully 

00:04:43.030 --> 00:04:46.090
 if you liked the video give me 

00:04:44.830 --> 00:04:47.680
 like if you did not know them subscribe to 

00:04:46.090 --> 00:04:49.920
 our channel and see you in the next 

00:04:47.680 --> 00:04:49.920
 video
