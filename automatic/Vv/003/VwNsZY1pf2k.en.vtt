again<00:00:38.370> so<00:00:38.940> is<00:00:39.510> a<00:00:39.570> little<00:00:39.809> bit<00:00:39.899> of<00:00:39.930> a<00:00:40.050> question

00:00:40.400 --> 00:00:40.410 
again so is a little bit of a question

00:00:40.410 --> 00:00:44.260 
again so is a little bit of a question
marking<00:00:40.829> and<00:00:41.100> we're<00:00:41.760> out<00:00:41.940> to<00:00:42.210> dispel<00:00:42.899> that<00:00:42.930> and

00:00:44.260 --> 00:00:44.270 
marking and we're out to dispel that and

00:00:44.270 --> 00:00:47.029 
marking and we're out to dispel that and
it's<00:00:45.270> going<00:00:45.420> to<00:00:45.510> be<00:00:45.629> very<00:00:45.660> very<00:00:45.960> close<00:00:46.410> tight<00:00:46.739> I

00:00:47.029 --> 00:00:47.039 
it's going to be very very close tight I

00:00:47.039 --> 00:00:49.069 
it's going to be very very close tight I
think<00:00:47.370> we've<00:00:47.460> got<00:00:47.550> a<00:00:47.579> great<00:00:48.270> team<00:00:48.329> here<00:00:48.570> since

00:01:05.060 --> 00:01:05.070 
guess a very short amount of time but

00:01:05.070 --> 00:01:06.800 
guess a very short amount of time but
for<00:01:05.400> me<00:01:05.519> it<00:01:05.670> was<00:01:05.790> very<00:01:06.030> important<00:01:06.420> to<00:01:06.450> continue

00:01:06.800 --> 00:01:06.810

00:02:05.860 --> 00:02:05.870 
my goals haven't solely pink top 10

00:02:05.870 --> 00:02:07.090 
my goals haven't solely pink top 10
that's<00:02:06.050> probably<00:02:06.320> something<00:02:06.500> more<00:02:06.920> than

00:02:07.090 --> 00:02:07.100 
that's probably something more than

00:02:07.100 --> 00:02:13.510 
that's probably something more than
Sam's<00:02:07.460> thinking<00:02:07.850> about<00:02:10.630> actually<00:02:12.520> more

00:02:13.510 --> 00:02:13.520 
Sam's thinking about actually more

00:02:13.520 --> 00:02:15.880 
Sam's thinking about actually more
realistic<00:02:13.790> but<00:02:14.210> for<00:02:14.360> myself<00:02:14.510> you<00:02:15.050> know<00:02:15.080> three

00:02:15.880 --> 00:02:15.890 
realistic but for myself you know three

00:02:15.890 --> 00:02:17.500 
realistic but for myself you know three
months<00:02:16.070> ago<00:02:16.250> with<00:02:16.550> 0<00:02:16.580> in<00:02:16.970> the<00:02:17.060> world<00:02:17.270> that's

00:02:17.500 --> 00:02:17.510 
months ago with 0 in the world that's

00:02:17.510 --> 00:02:20.170 
months ago with 0 in the world that's
outside<00:02:18.140> of<00:02:18.320> thousands<00:02:19.010> my<00:02:19.700> steps<00:02:20.000> are<00:02:20.150> a

00:02:20.170 --> 00:02:20.180 
outside of thousands my steps are a

00:02:20.180 --> 00:02:22.690 
outside of thousands my steps are a
little<00:02:20.300> smaller<00:02:20.690> I'm<00:02:20.870> 164<00:02:21.830> moment<00:02:22.160> my<00:02:22.280> goal<00:02:22.550> is

00:02:22.690 --> 00:02:22.700 
little smaller I'm 164 moment my goal is

00:02:22.700 --> 00:02:25.060 
little smaller I'm 164 moment my goal is
to<00:02:22.970> earn<00:02:23.600> my<00:02:23.870> spot<00:02:23.930> into<00:02:24.470> each<00:02:24.560> of<00:02:24.740> the<00:02:24.800> Grand

00:02:25.060 --> 00:02:25.070 
to earn my spot into each of the Grand

00:02:25.070 --> 00:02:28.000 
to earn my spot into each of the Grand
Slams<00:02:25.400> next<00:02:25.970> camp<00:02:26.150> this<00:02:26.330> this<00:02:26.780> year<00:02:27.110> I<00:02:27.350> think

00:02:28.000 --> 00:02:28.010 
Slams next camp this this year I think

00:02:28.010 --> 00:02:30.040 
Slams next camp this this year I think
that<00:02:28.850> one<00:02:29.150> of<00:02:29.180> the<00:02:29.239> highlights<00:02:29.660> of<00:02:29.720> the<00:02:29.840> tire

00:02:30.040 --> 00:02:30.050 
that one of the highlights of the tire

00:02:30.050 --> 00:02:31.720 
that one of the highlights of the tire
the<00:02:30.230> doubles<00:02:30.560> teams<00:02:30.800> probably<00:02:31.489> got<00:02:31.580> the<00:02:31.700> best

00:02:31.720 --> 00:02:31.730 
the doubles teams probably got the best

00:02:31.730 --> 00:02:34.260 
the doubles teams probably got the best
to<00:02:32.270> fed<00:02:32.570> cup<00:02:32.810> doubles<00:02:33.170> teams<00:02:33.410> in<00:02:33.560> the<00:02:33.620> world<00:02:33.800> he

00:02:34.260 --> 00:02:34.270 
to fed cup doubles teams in the world he

00:02:34.270 --> 00:02:35.880 
to fed cup doubles teams in the world he
they<00:02:35.270> won

00:02:35.880 --> 00:02:35.890 
they won

00:02:35.890 --> 00:02:38.790 
they won
the<00:02:36.490> world<00:02:36.730> championship<00:02:37.300> last<00:02:37.510> year<00:02:37.800> being

00:02:38.790 --> 00:02:38.800 
the world championship last year being

00:02:38.800 --> 00:02:40.890 
the world championship last year being
the<00:02:38.920> Williams<00:02:39.370> which<00:02:39.550> is<00:02:39.670> a<00:02:39.700> very<00:02:39.940> rare<00:02:40.300> rare

00:02:40.890 --> 00:02:40.900 
the Williams which is a very rare rare

00:02:40.900 --> 00:02:43.170 
the Williams which is a very rare rare
theming<00:02:41.260> women's<00:02:41.530> doubles<00:02:41.860> and<00:02:42.130> our<00:02:42.940> girls

00:02:43.170 --> 00:02:43.180 
theming women's doubles and our girls

00:02:43.180 --> 00:02:45.000 
theming women's doubles and our girls
obviously<00:02:43.600> made<00:02:44.020> the<00:02:44.050> Wimbledon<00:02:44.470> final<00:02:44.860> last

00:02:45.000 --> 00:02:45.010 
obviously made the Wimbledon final last

00:02:45.010 --> 00:02:47.340 
obviously made the Wimbledon final last
year<00:02:45.310> made<00:02:46.180> it<00:02:46.240> another<00:02:46.959> grand<00:02:47.260> slam

00:02:47.340 --> 00:02:47.350 
year made it another grand slam

00:02:47.350 --> 00:02:50.280

semi-final<00:02:48.240> and<00:02:49.240> both<00:02:49.540> finished<00:02:49.930> in<00:02:50.020> the<00:02:50.110> top

00:02:50.280 --> 00:02:50.290 
semi-final and both finished in the top

00:02:50.290 --> 00:02:53.100 
semi-final and both finished in the top
10<00:02:50.319> so<00:02:50.880> very<00:02:51.880> very<00:02:51.970> strong<00:02:52.570> doubles<00:02:52.900> teams

00:02:53.100 --> 00:02:53.110 
10 so very very strong doubles teams

00:02:53.110 --> 00:02:55.470 
10 so very very strong doubles teams
here<00:02:53.350> as<00:02:54.040> I<00:02:54.310> said<00:02:54.370> the<00:02:54.610> best<00:02:54.760> two<00:02:54.970> teams<00:02:55.000> in<00:02:55.360> the

00:02:55.470 --> 00:02:55.480 
here as I said the best two teams in the

00:02:55.480 --> 00:02:58.050 
here as I said the best two teams in the
world<00:02:55.630> so<00:02:56.110> if<00:02:56.440> it<00:02:56.620> comes<00:02:56.650> down<00:02:56.890> to<00:02:57.160> that<00:02:57.190> when

00:02:58.050 --> 00:02:58.060 
world so if it comes down to that when

00:02:58.060 --> 00:03:00.210 
world so if it comes down to that when
it's<00:02:58.209> going<00:02:58.300> to<00:02:58.390> be<00:02:58.480> very<00:02:58.510> exciting<00:02:59.170> I<00:02:59.320> think

00:03:00.210 --> 00:03:00.220 
it's going to be very exciting I think

00:03:00.220 --> 00:03:01.650 
it's going to be very exciting I think
it's<00:03:00.310> come<00:03:00.490> full<00:03:00.640> circle<00:03:00.700> that<00:03:01.209> this<00:03:01.390> would<00:03:01.540> be

00:03:01.650 --> 00:03:01.660 
it's come full circle that this would be

00:03:01.660 --> 00:03:03.270 
it's come full circle that this would be
the<00:03:01.780> team<00:03:01.989> that<00:03:02.020> would<00:03:02.440> be<00:03:02.800> able<00:03:02.890> to<00:03:03.040> get<00:03:03.190> us

00:03:03.270 --> 00:03:03.280 
the team that would be able to get us

00:03:03.280 --> 00:03:05.610 
the team that would be able to get us
through<00:03:03.840> to<00:03:04.840> get<00:03:04.959> back<00:03:05.110> to<00:03:05.230> the<00:03:05.319> world<00:03:05.470> group

00:03:05.610 --> 00:03:05.620 
through to get back to the world group

00:03:05.620 --> 00:03:07.110 
through to get back to the world group
where<00:03:05.770> we<00:03:05.800> belong<00:03:06.160> I<00:03:06.340> just<00:03:06.489> think<00:03:06.670> women's

00:03:07.110 --> 00:03:07.120 
where we belong I just think women's

00:03:07.120 --> 00:03:08.490 
where we belong I just think women's
tennis<00:03:07.300> in<00:03:07.510> Australia<00:03:07.840> belongs<00:03:08.110> in<00:03:08.260> the<00:03:08.320> world

00:03:08.490 --> 00:03:08.500 
tennis in Australia belongs in the world

00:03:08.500 --> 00:03:09.600 
tennis in Australia belongs in the world
group<00:03:08.709> there's<00:03:08.920> some<00:03:09.070> teams<00:03:09.280> in<00:03:09.430> the<00:03:09.520> world

00:03:09.600 --> 00:03:09.610 
group there's some teams in the world

00:03:09.610 --> 00:03:10.920 
group there's some teams in the world
group<00:03:09.880> that<00:03:10.030> I<00:03:10.090> don't<00:03:10.270> think<00:03:10.480> have<00:03:10.600> anywhere

00:03:10.920 --> 00:03:10.930 
group that I don't think have anywhere

00:03:10.930 --> 00:03:13.860 
group that I don't think have anywhere
near<00:03:10.989> the<00:03:11.140> depth<00:03:11.470> that<00:03:11.560> we<00:03:11.680> do<00:03:11.950> and<00:03:12.190> and<00:03:12.870> you
