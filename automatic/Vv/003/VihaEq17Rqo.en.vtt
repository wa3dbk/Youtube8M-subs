00:00:00.500 --> 00:00:04.410
 the multi window is one of the 

00:00:02.820 --> 00:00:06.060
 most outstanding functionalities about 

00:00:04.410 --> 00:00:08.460
 everything to take advantage of the great 

00:00:06.060 --> 00:00:11.990
 5.7 inch screen we could by 

00:00:08.460 --> 00:00:11.990
 example take out the gallery 

00:00:14.240 --> 00:00:20.070
 the gallery we will see the general view 

00:00:17.789 --> 00:00:22.590
 a general view with all the images 

00:00:20.070 --> 00:00:25.650
 videos and any other application by 

00:00:22.590 --> 00:00:28.130
 example the notes that you see we have 

00:00:25.650 --> 00:00:31.820
 the two applications at the same time 

00:00:28.130 --> 00:00:34.350
 we could use the notes and see 

00:00:31.820 --> 00:00:35.430
 any of the documents of the 

00:00:34.350 --> 00:00:37.710
 Gallery 

00:00:35.430 --> 00:00:39.690
 So much so that we can even 

00:00:37.710 --> 00:00:42.690
 interact with them I will create a 

00:00:39.690 --> 00:00:45.680
 new page in the note and bring me this 

00:00:42.690 --> 00:00:45.680
 image to the note 

00:00:47.150 --> 00:00:50.680
 track android properties 

00:00:51.620 --> 00:00:55.180
 yes yes 

00:00:59.430 --> 00:01:03.140
 I will not do from the general view 

00:01:03.860 --> 00:01:08.570
 we wanted this image 

00:01:17.880 --> 00:01:26.820
 insert in the note now for example 

00:01:22.500 --> 00:01:26.820
 we could take notes on it 

00:01:27.300 --> 00:01:32.310
 and what we would like with this 

00:01:30.210 --> 00:01:34.560
 format of course if we want 

00:01:32.310 --> 00:01:36.100
 work horizontally we could go with 

00:01:34.560 --> 00:01:38.500
 Total freedom 

00:01:36.100 --> 00:01:40.869
 the two windows we could add 

00:01:38.500 --> 00:01:42.180
 floating windows in this case two 

00:01:40.869 --> 00:01:47.060
 main but floating windows 

00:01:42.180 --> 00:01:48.740
 acerco touched the button on windows 

00:01:47.060 --> 00:01:50.990
 then I have total freedom to 

00:01:48.740 --> 00:01:53.630
 draw windows of the size and position 

00:01:50.990 --> 00:01:55.310
 that I want are basic applications 

00:01:53.630 --> 00:01:58.100
 that we may need at a given moment 

00:01:55.310 --> 00:02:00.409
 for example the calculator and take a 

00:01:58.100 --> 00:02:02.689
 annotation in the notes and working with 

00:02:00.409 --> 00:02:04.429
 the gallery that you have in this case the 

00:02:02.689 --> 00:02:06.720
 calculator could even add more 

00:02:04.429 --> 00:02:09.869
 Applications 

00:02:06.720 --> 00:02:12.870
 in a tiny window 

00:02:09.869 --> 00:02:14.310
 for contacts for example 

00:02:12.870 --> 00:02:15.690
 very useful imagined for example that 

00:02:14.310 --> 00:02:18.000
 we are receiving an SMS in some 

00:02:15.690 --> 00:02:20.340
 windows that we are going to pass on to a 

00:02:18.000 --> 00:02:22.170
 friend of ours the contact of another friend 

00:02:20.340 --> 00:02:25.909
 and we could see it in this mini window and 

00:02:22.170 --> 00:02:25.909
 write in the message 

00:02:26.720 --> 00:02:31.700
 pastor thanks to having a processor 

00:02:28.730 --> 00:02:34.420
 high speed and a large ram 

00:02:31.700 --> 00:02:34.420
 3GB of memory 

00:02:37.230 --> 00:02:39.860
 and lots
