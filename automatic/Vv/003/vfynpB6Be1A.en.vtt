wearing right here and this allow and my
gap<00:01:41.299> is<00:01:41.479> parallel<00:01:42.430> so<00:01:43.430> this<00:01:43.700> is<00:01:43.909> just<00:01:44.329> right

00:01:44.560 --> 00:01:44.570 
gap is parallel so this is just right

weave<00:01:44.990> it<00:01:45.140> on<00:01:45.259> the<00:01:45.680> bare<00:01:45.890> saddle<00:01:46.310> so<00:01:46.520> when<00:01:46.700> we

00:01:46.810 --> 00:01:46.820 
weave it on the bare saddle so when we

00:01:46.820 --> 00:01:49.179 
weave it on the bare saddle so when we
add<00:01:46.969> our<00:01:47.119> saddle<00:01:47.479> pad<00:01:47.659> it<00:01:48.020> won't<00:01:48.740> be<00:01:48.920> tight
