so<00:00:20.570> this<00:00:20.720> is<00:00:20.900> proceeding<00:00:21.650> a<00:00:21.740> synthesis<00:00:22.420> often

00:00:23.410 --> 00:00:23.420 
so this is proceeding a synthesis often

00:00:23.420 --> 00:00:26.200 
so this is proceeding a synthesis often
reverse<00:00:24.350> transcriptase<00:00:25.100> will<00:00:25.430> come<00:00:25.640> in<00:00:25.850> kids

00:00:48.220 --> 00:00:48.230 
protocols this one I printed out from

00:00:48.230 --> 00:00:50.020 
protocols this one I printed out from
the<00:00:48.379> internet<00:00:48.769> right<00:00:49.100> I<00:00:49.129> just<00:00:49.309> went<00:00:49.670> in<00:00:49.790> vitro

00:00:50.020 --> 00:00:50.030 
the internet right I just went in vitro

00:00:50.030 --> 00:00:52.570 
the internet right I just went in vitro
gin<00:00:50.330> looked<00:00:50.570> up<00:00:50.720> the<00:00:50.870> kidney<00:00:51.290> and<00:00:51.590> printed<00:00:52.489> out

00:00:52.570 --> 00:00:52.580 
gin looked up the kidney and printed out

00:00:52.580 --> 00:00:54.310 
gin looked up the kidney and printed out
the<00:00:52.729> protocol<00:00:53.210> and<00:00:53.390> they<00:00:53.600> have<00:00:53.720> a<00:00:53.750> suggested

00:00:54.310 --> 00:00:54.320 
the protocol and they have a suggested

00:00:54.320 --> 00:00:55.840 
the protocol and they have a suggested
use<00:00:54.440> on<00:00:54.620> how<00:00:54.769> to<00:00:54.830> do<00:00:54.979> reverse<00:00:55.309> transcription

00:00:55.840 --> 00:00:55.850 
use on how to do reverse transcription

use on how to do reverse transcription
for<00:00:56.750> this<00:00:56.930> kit<00:00:57.199> it<00:00:57.769> only<00:00:58.040> requires<00:00:58.549> the<00:00:59.239> enzyme

00:00:59.680 --> 00:00:59.690 
for this kit it only requires the enzyme

00:00:59.690 --> 00:01:03.579 
for this kit it only requires the enzyme
is<00:00:59.960> this<00:01:00.140> a<00:01:00.440> 10<00:01:01.280> X<00:01:01.489> superscript<00:01:01.670> plus<00:01:02.390> a<00:01:03.019> buffer

00:01:03.579 --> 00:01:03.589 
is this a 10 X superscript plus a buffer

00:01:03.589 --> 00:01:07.270 
is this a 10 X superscript plus a buffer
which<00:01:03.830> is<00:01:03.860> the<00:01:04.100> 5x<00:01:04.549> vial<00:01:05.299> reaction<00:01:05.930> mix<00:01:06.280> RNA

00:01:07.270 --> 00:01:07.280 
which is the 5x vial reaction mix RNA

00:01:07.280 --> 00:01:10.210 
which is the 5x vial reaction mix RNA
and<00:01:07.520> water<00:01:08.200> other<00:01:09.200> kits<00:01:09.560> require<00:01:09.770> you<00:01:10.190> to

00:01:10.210 --> 00:01:10.220 
and water other kits require you to

00:01:10.220 --> 00:01:15.010 
and water other kits require you to
separately<00:01:10.700> add<00:01:10.970> the<00:01:12.130> dntps<00:01:13.330> perhaps<00:01:14.330> dtt

00:01:15.010 --> 00:01:15.020 
separately add the dntps perhaps dtt

00:01:15.020 --> 00:01:18.820 
separately add the dntps perhaps dtt
that's<00:01:15.470> common<00:01:15.979> in<00:01:16.810> c<00:01:17.810> DNA<00:01:18.080> synthesis<00:01:18.590> kist

00:01:18.820 --> 00:01:18.830 
that's common in c DNA synthesis kist

00:01:18.830 --> 00:01:20.890 
that's common in c DNA synthesis kist
add<00:01:19.040> those<00:01:19.280> two<00:01:19.460> things<00:01:19.490> separately<00:01:20.119> but<00:01:20.780> in

00:01:20.890 --> 00:01:20.900 
add those two things separately but in

00:01:20.900 --> 00:01:23.380 
add those two things separately but in
this<00:01:20.990> kit<00:01:21.229> the<00:01:21.920> viola<00:01:22.400> reaction<00:01:23.000> make<00:01:23.180> sure

00:01:23.380 --> 00:01:23.390 
this kit the viola reaction make sure

00:01:23.390 --> 00:01:25.719 
this kit the viola reaction make sure
that<00:01:23.510> the<00:01:23.810> master<00:01:24.409> mix<00:01:24.560> buffer<00:01:25.039> if<00:01:25.399> you<00:01:25.549> will

00:01:25.719 --> 00:01:25.729 
that the master mix buffer if you will

00:01:25.729 --> 00:01:27.700 
that the master mix buffer if you will
has<00:01:26.030> all<00:01:26.329> the<00:01:26.509> reagents<00:01:26.689> and<00:01:27.140> we<00:01:27.229> need<00:01:27.409> in<00:01:27.560> it

00:01:27.700 --> 00:01:27.710 
has all the reagents and we need in it

00:01:27.710 --> 00:01:29.950 
has all the reagents and we need in it
so<00:01:27.979> we<00:01:28.189> only<00:01:28.310> need<00:01:28.430> the<00:01:28.640> buffer<00:01:29.000> the<00:01:29.240> enzyme

00:01:29.950 --> 00:01:29.960 
so we only need the buffer the enzyme

00:01:29.960 --> 00:01:33.520 
so we only need the buffer the enzyme
makes<00:01:30.259> RNA<00:01:30.979> and<00:01:31.219> water<00:01:32.109> so<00:01:33.109> I<00:01:33.140> have<00:01:33.350> those

00:01:33.520 --> 00:01:33.530 
makes RNA and water so I have those

00:01:33.530 --> 00:01:39.490 
makes RNA and water so I have those
reagents<00:01:34.070> here<00:01:36.399> this<00:01:37.399> is<00:01:37.609> the<00:01:37.789> enzyme<00:01:37.909> mix<00:01:38.500> the

00:01:39.490 --> 00:01:39.500 
reagents here this is the enzyme mix the

00:01:39.500 --> 00:01:44.370 
reagents here this is the enzyme mix the
buffer<00:01:40.210> you<00:01:41.210> still<00:01:41.479> need<00:01:41.659> to<00:01:42.009> fall<00:01:43.009> out

00:01:44.370 --> 00:01:44.380 
buffer you still need to fall out

00:01:44.380 --> 00:01:49.680 
buffer you still need to fall out
and<00:01:44.470> some<00:01:45.310> water<00:01:45.550> and<00:01:45.960> our<00:01:47.250> RNA<00:01:48.690> starting

00:01:49.680 --> 00:01:49.690 
and some water and our RNA starting

00:01:49.690 --> 00:01:51.719 
and some water and our RNA starting
material<00:01:50.140> can<00:01:50.290> range<00:01:50.470> from<00:01:50.590> two<00:01:50.979> my<00:01:51.280> programs

00:01:51.719 --> 00:01:51.729 
material can range from two my programs

00:01:51.729 --> 00:01:56.490 
material can range from two my programs
of<00:01:51.970> total<00:01:52.390> RNA<00:01:52.920> up<00:01:53.920> to<00:01:54.450> 2.5<00:01:55.450> micrograms<00:01:56.290> of

of total RNA up to 2.5 micrograms of
total<00:01:56.920> RNA<00:01:57.250> we're<00:01:58.150> going<00:01:58.270> to<00:01:58.360> have<00:01:58.450> less<00:01:58.690> than

00:01:58.710 --> 00:01:58.720 
total RNA we're going to have less than

00:01:58.720 --> 00:02:03.060 
total RNA we're going to have less than
that<00:01:59.910> this<00:02:00.910> reaction<00:02:01.330> these<00:02:02.140> tubes<00:02:02.500> are<00:02:02.740> right

00:02:03.060 --> 00:02:03.070 
that this reaction these tubes are right

00:02:03.070 --> 00:02:05.490 
that this reaction these tubes are right
about<00:02:03.280> it<00:02:03.490> sixteen<00:02:04.380> nanograms<00:02:05.380> per

00:02:05.490 --> 00:02:05.500 
about it sixteen nanograms per

00:02:05.500 --> 00:02:09.330 
about it sixteen nanograms per
microliter<00:02:06.960> we<00:02:07.960> are<00:02:08.140> going<00:02:08.440> to<00:02:08.590> use<00:02:08.770> all<00:02:09.130> of

00:02:09.330 --> 00:02:09.340 
microliter we are going to use all of

00:02:09.340 --> 00:02:12.390 
microliter we are going to use all of
the<00:02:09.550> reaction<00:02:10.470> so<00:02:11.470> we<00:02:11.560> can<00:02:11.680> get<00:02:11.800> enough<00:02:12.010> total

00:02:12.390 --> 00:02:12.400 
the reaction so we can get enough total

00:02:12.400 --> 00:02:16.350 
the reaction so we can get enough total
RNA<00:02:12.670> to<00:02:12.850> the<00:02:13.230> reverse<00:02:14.230> transcription<00:02:14.830> so<00:02:15.580> for

00:02:16.350 --> 00:02:16.360 
RNA to the reverse transcription so for

00:02:16.360 --> 00:02:18.240 
RNA to the reverse transcription so for
C<00:02:16.660> DNA<00:02:16.930> synthesis<00:02:17.440> I'm<00:02:17.620> going<00:02:17.770> to<00:02:17.830> label<00:02:18.130> a

00:02:25.510 --> 00:02:27.840 
tube cDNA and now in my lab book
obviously<00:02:25.720> I'll<00:02:26.230> be<00:02:26.380> writing<00:02:26.620> down<00:02:26.890> what

00:02:27.840 --> 00:02:27.850 
obviously I'll be writing down what

00:02:27.850 --> 00:02:30.030 
obviously I'll be writing down what
tissue<00:02:28.120> it<00:02:28.450> is<00:02:28.570> because<00:02:29.050> cDNA<00:02:29.560> is<00:02:29.620> and<00:02:29.890> just

00:02:30.030 --> 00:02:30.040 
tissue it is because cDNA is and just

00:02:30.040 --> 00:02:32.130 
tissue it is because cDNA is and just
like<00:02:30.220> genomic<00:02:30.670> DNA<00:02:30.850> I<00:02:31.180> mean<00:02:31.360> every<00:02:31.630> sample<00:02:31.870> is

00:02:32.130 --> 00:02:32.140 
like genomic DNA I mean every sample is

00:02:32.140 --> 00:02:35.460 
like genomic DNA I mean every sample is
different<00:02:33.120> in<00:02:34.120> every<00:02:34.360> sample<00:02:34.720> of<00:02:35.020> RNA<00:02:35.410> is

00:02:48.000 --> 00:02:48.010 
extracting the RNA pool as you all know

00:02:48.010 --> 00:02:49.770 
extracting the RNA pool as you all know
is<00:02:48.220> going<00:02:48.310> to<00:02:48.400> be<00:02:48.489> different<00:02:48.910> depending<00:02:49.390> on

00:02:49.770 --> 00:02:49.780 
is going to be different depending on

00:02:49.780 --> 00:02:51.960 
is going to be different depending on
the<00:02:49.959> genes<00:02:50.200> that<00:02:50.320> are<00:02:50.410> expressed<00:02:50.820> so<00:02:51.820> it's

00:02:51.960 --> 00:02:51.970 
the genes that are expressed so it's

00:02:51.970 --> 00:02:56.030 
the genes that are expressed so it's
important<00:02:52.450> wherever<00:02:52.630> you<00:02:53.220> record<00:02:54.220> the<00:02:55.120> cDNA

00:02:56.030 --> 00:02:56.040 
important wherever you record the cDNA

00:02:56.040 --> 00:02:58.800 
important wherever you record the cDNA
or<00:02:57.040> make<00:02:57.220> your<00:02:57.370> cDNA<00:02:57.850> that<00:02:58.000> you<00:02:58.090> also<00:02:58.269> record

00:02:58.800 --> 00:02:58.810 
or make your cDNA that you also record

00:02:58.810 --> 00:03:00.720 
or make your cDNA that you also record
the<00:02:58.900> tissue<00:02:59.110> type<00:02:59.440> and<00:02:59.739> what<00:02:59.890> RNA<00:03:00.250> sample<00:03:00.640> it

00:03:00.720 --> 00:03:00.730 
the tissue type and what RNA sample it

00:03:00.730 --> 00:03:04.199 
the tissue type and what RNA sample it
came<00:03:00.940> from<00:03:01.290> so<00:03:02.290> the<00:03:03.100> instructions<00:03:03.700> here<00:03:03.910> for

00:03:04.199 --> 00:03:04.209 
came from so the instructions here for

00:03:04.209 --> 00:03:07.560 
came from so the instructions here for
the<00:03:04.540> bi-lo<00:03:05.470> say<00:03:06.370> first<00:03:06.670> of<00:03:06.790> all<00:03:06.940> we<00:03:07.150> need<00:03:07.299> four

00:03:07.560 --> 00:03:07.570 
the bi-lo say first of all we need four

00:03:07.570 --> 00:03:11.400 
the bi-lo say first of all we need four
microliters<00:03:08.170> of<00:03:08.200> that<00:03:09.299> reaction<00:03:10.299> mix<00:03:10.750> or<00:03:11.230> the

00:03:11.400 --> 00:03:11.410 
microliters of that reaction mix or the

00:03:11.410 --> 00:03:17.490 
microliters of that reaction mix or the
buffer

00:03:17.490 --> 00:03:17.500 

00:03:17.500 --> 00:03:23.310 

put<00:03:17.920> that<00:03:18.100> into<00:03:18.280> the<00:03:18.460> CDA<00:03:18.820> -<00:03:21.450> we<00:03:22.450> need<00:03:22.660> two

00:03:23.310 --> 00:03:23.320 
put that into the CDA - we need two

00:03:23.320 --> 00:03:33.580 
put that into the CDA - we need two
microliters<00:03:24.190> of<00:03:24.220> the<00:03:24.670> file<00:03:25.480> Oh

00:03:33.580 --> 00:03:33.590 

00:03:33.590 --> 00:03:37.309 

four-twenty<00:03:34.590> microliter<00:03:35.280> volume<00:03:36.050> we<00:03:37.050> need<00:03:37.200> to

00:03:37.309 --> 00:03:37.319 
four-twenty microliter volume we need to

00:03:37.319 --> 00:03:51.400 
four-twenty microliter volume we need to
add<00:03:37.410> 14<00:03:38.750> of<00:03:39.750> our<00:03:40.530> RNA

00:03:51.400 --> 00:03:51.410 

00:03:51.410 --> 00:03:57.820 

now<00:03:51.830> mixing<00:03:52.250> my<00:03:52.700> patter

00:03:57.820 --> 00:03:57.830 

00:03:57.830 --> 00:04:00.640 

okay<00:03:58.400> it's<00:03:58.610> mixed<00:03:58.910> up<00:03:59.030> now<00:03:59.900> this<00:04:00.080> particular

00:04:00.640 --> 00:04:00.650 
okay it's mixed up now this particular

00:04:00.650 --> 00:04:03.370 
okay it's mixed up now this particular
reaction<00:04:00.980> says<00:04:01.460> or<00:04:01.970> protocol<00:04:02.780> says<00:04:03.110> we're<00:04:03.350> to

00:04:03.370 --> 00:04:03.380 
reaction says or protocol says we're to

00:04:03.380 --> 00:04:05.800 
reaction says or protocol says we're to
sit<00:04:03.800> at<00:04:04.550> ten<00:04:04.880> minutes<00:04:05.210> of<00:04:05.330> room<00:04:05.480> temperature

00:04:05.800 --> 00:04:05.810 
sit at ten minutes of room temperature

00:04:05.810 --> 00:04:07.120 
sit at ten minutes of room temperature
and<00:04:06.110> that's<00:04:06.230> not<00:04:06.440> normal

00:04:07.120 --> 00:04:07.130 
and that's not normal

00:04:07.130 --> 00:04:09.190 
and that's not normal
other<00:04:07.610> kits<00:04:08.000> are<00:04:08.180> very<00:04:08.420> different<00:04:08.660> you<00:04:08.990> go

00:04:09.190 --> 00:04:09.200 
other kits are very different you go

00:04:09.200 --> 00:04:11.620 
other kits are very different you go
directly<00:04:09.770> to<00:04:10.070> the<00:04:10.400> incubation<00:04:10.910> of<00:04:11.180> 42<00:04:11.600> degrees

00:04:11.620 --> 00:04:11.630 
directly to the incubation of 42 degrees

00:04:11.630 --> 00:04:13.450 
directly to the incubation of 42 degrees
after<00:04:12.140> 10<00:04:12.500> minutes<00:04:12.800> we're<00:04:12.980> going<00:04:13.100> to<00:04:13.190> put<00:04:13.370> it

00:04:13.450 --> 00:04:13.460 
after 10 minutes we're going to put it

00:04:13.460 --> 00:04:16.060 
after 10 minutes we're going to put it
at<00:04:13.550> 42<00:04:13.940> degrees<00:04:14.210> for<00:04:14.480> an<00:04:14.630> hour<00:04:14.860> so<00:04:15.860> I'm<00:04:15.920> going

00:04:16.060 --> 00:04:16.070 
at 42 degrees for an hour so I'm going

00:04:16.070 --> 00:04:21.569 
at 42 degrees for an hour so I'm going
to<00:04:16.100> set<00:04:16.310> timer<00:04:16.880> to<00:04:17.530> 10<00:04:18.530> minutes

00:04:21.569 --> 00:04:21.579 

00:04:21.579 --> 00:04:23.670 

okay<00:04:22.000> so<00:04:22.060> our<00:04:22.300> timer<00:04:22.569> just<00:04:22.870> went<00:04:22.990> off<00:04:23.199> for<00:04:23.530> the

00:04:23.670 --> 00:04:23.680 
okay so our timer just went off for the

00:04:23.680 --> 00:04:26.730 
okay so our timer just went off for the
reverse<00:04:24.190> transcription<00:04:24.759> so<00:04:25.659> it's<00:04:26.349> been<00:04:26.500> 10

00:04:26.730 --> 00:04:26.740 
reverse transcription so it's been 10

00:04:26.740 --> 00:04:28.140 
reverse transcription so it's been 10
minutes<00:04:27.039> now<00:04:27.159> room<00:04:27.430> temperature<00:04:27.849> we're<00:04:28.030> going

00:04:28.140 --> 00:04:28.150 
minutes now room temperature we're going

00:04:28.150 --> 00:04:31.170 
minutes now room temperature we're going
to<00:04:28.210> put<00:04:28.360> it<00:04:28.449> 42<00:04:28.930> degrees<00:04:29.520> and<00:04:30.520> it<00:04:30.849> just<00:04:31.030> so

00:04:31.170 --> 00:04:31.180 
to put it 42 degrees and it just so

00:04:31.180 --> 00:04:33.089 
to put it 42 degrees and it just so
happens<00:04:31.569> that<00:04:31.690> I<00:04:31.810> have<00:04:31.990> a<00:04:32.020> block<00:04:32.319> here<00:04:32.650> sitting

00:04:33.089 --> 00:04:33.099 
happens that I have a block here sitting

00:04:33.099 --> 00:04:35.879 
happens that I have a block here sitting
at<00:04:33.250> 42<00:04:33.759> degrees<00:04:34.259> we're<00:04:35.259> going<00:04:35.409> to<00:04:35.470> put<00:04:35.650> that<00:04:35.740> in

00:04:35.879 --> 00:04:35.889 
at 42 degrees we're going to put that in

00:04:35.889 --> 00:04:38.849 
at 42 degrees we're going to put that in
there<00:04:36.099> for<00:04:36.400> the<00:04:36.460> next<00:04:36.669> hour
