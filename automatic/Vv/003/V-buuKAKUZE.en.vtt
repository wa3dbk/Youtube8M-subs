00:00:18.259 --> 00:00:21.429
 Machnig journey through the most beautiful country in the world and maintainer today in the 

00:00:21.429 --> 00:00:25.039
 Capital Berlin Viechtach but three million overnight guests in 2009 

00:00:25.039 --> 00:00:28.409
 after London and Paris the most popular city travel destinations in Europe 

00:00:32.960 --> 00:00:35.880
 Visitors to the Reichstag date were around 90 percent of Germans 

00:00:35.880 --> 00:00:36.950
 government 

00:00:36.950 --> 00:00:40.219
 find the meeting of the Bundestag in the election of the Federal President 

00:00:40.219 --> 00:00:41.500
 the buildings take place 

00:00:41.500 --> 00:00:45.280
 Formerly the assembly of the deputies called parliamentary elections Reichstag 

00:00:45.280 --> 00:00:47.019
 this name is for the building 

00:00:47.019 --> 00:00:48.660
 received until today 

00:00:48.660 --> 00:00:52.360
 This huge building would have a lot of action behind it 

00:00:52.360 --> 00:00:55.870
 here the equal StrÃ¤ter extends and the parliament of the Weimar Republic 

00:00:55.870 --> 00:01:00.160
 during the German division he even went as a museum 

00:01:01.630 --> 00:01:04.690
 After the fall of the wall, the Reichstag was once shrouded in 

00:01:04.690 --> 00:01:08.730
 rebuilt after the American artist Park Christo and Jean-Claude 

00:01:08.730 --> 00:01:12.110
 is the famous cover of the British star architect Sir Norman Foster 

00:01:12.110 --> 00:01:15.110
 today a crowd puller 

00:01:16.500 --> 00:01:19.719
 I think then the building was ever Euro 

00:01:19.719 --> 00:01:22.719
 which topics or polls the local council will become 

00:01:23.680 --> 00:01:25.550
 more 

00:01:25.550 --> 00:01:29.700
 yes everything light fog the cornerstone was in 1884 by Emperor Wilhelm Dilthey 

00:01:29.700 --> 00:01:30.780
 first laid 

00:01:30.780 --> 00:01:33.810
 These incredible tourist crowds all want to go to the Reichstag 

00:01:33.810 --> 00:01:36.810
 which are finally on 

00:01:39.530 --> 00:01:43.520
 The first thing that looks like the bullet is like all other tourists 

00:01:46.900 --> 00:01:50.250
 but then that I do not look at the presents of the Saar statesmen 

00:01:50.250 --> 00:01:53.250
 throw 

00:01:56.200 --> 00:02:00.420
 and exceptionally, I may even enter a room of the red line normally 

00:02:00.420 --> 00:02:01.950
 remains closed 

00:02:01.950 --> 00:02:05.350
 on this chair but one works now the Bundestag president 

00:02:12.019 --> 00:02:14.999
 On the way out I come to describe all previous MPs 

00:02:14.999 --> 00:02:15.969
 refer 

00:02:15.969 --> 00:02:18.989
 thanks to an old Russian artist from the period after the Second World War 

00:02:26.349 --> 00:02:29.329
 to get an even better insight into the Reichstag today goes into the 

00:02:29.329 --> 00:02:32.469
 Apprenticeship at the visitor service and will work for the team 

00:02:35.249 --> 00:02:38.670
 Buhrow looking at the Reichstag dome just like the many 

00:02:38.669 --> 00:02:40.509
 Situations Town Hall 

00:02:40.509 --> 00:02:42.979
 the Brandenburg Gate 

00:02:42.979 --> 00:02:45.979
 Take a look at it 

00:02:48.169 --> 00:02:51.169
 about which 

00:02:51.669 --> 00:02:52.959
 from otto-h 

00:02:52.959 --> 00:02:56.539
 again wrong or the Ahlener does not really have to give 

00:02:56.539 --> 00:03:01.269
 because water makes people talk quite interesting today 

00:03:01.269 --> 00:03:04.269
 back people are coming back 

00:03:06.659 --> 00:03:09.329
 even losing Actelion wants to be learned 

00:03:09.329 --> 00:03:12.980
 what is the most common question that is asked the most common question is 

00:03:12.979 --> 00:03:16.029
 actually too much to expect and Prague 

00:03:16.029 --> 00:03:19.059
 Opened by Hannes Wallner the building and the answer the answer 

00:03:19.059 --> 00:03:21.989
 so it's about two hours at the bar now 

00:03:21.989 --> 00:03:27.269
 varies and the opening hours are from 8 to 10 according to the Senate 

00:03:29.329 --> 00:03:30.270
 asserts with 

00:03:30.270 --> 00:03:32.419
 before the free newsletter 

00:03:32.419 --> 00:03:35.419
 It took two hours to get there 

00:03:37.089 --> 00:03:40.400
 real the week of meetings in here is quite a few years ago 

00:03:40.400 --> 00:03:43.550
 It connects so massively behind a million tourists in Japan 

00:03:43.549 --> 00:03:47.959
 reduced we have about 8000 visitors a day but only go 

00:03:47.959 --> 00:03:51.579
 3000 and its consequences of an estate north on the dome 

00:03:51.579 --> 00:03:58.629
 on the 8 and the 2007 on the visit of a planned in Artern Rainer then 

00:03:58.629 --> 00:04:01.629
 today we would have a merge into a series of changes 

00:04:06.729 --> 00:04:10.569
 the Reichstag with the stroller is Germany's most important political 

00:04:11.509 --> 00:04:14.379
 therefore give tractor for the social meaning 

00:04:14.379 --> 00:04:17.120
 full score med five races 

00:04:17.120 --> 00:04:20.109
 May in Kiel one expects for the art market and this way 

00:04:20.109 --> 00:04:22.509
 but you have the tour of the Reichstag 

00:04:22.509 --> 00:04:26.590
 the garbage workers of photo artists as before coined the on Baselitz brother 

00:04:26.589 --> 00:04:30.979
 Joseph Beuys noticed therefore forgives for the art market place present 

00:04:30.979 --> 00:04:32.719
 asterisk 

00:04:32.719 --> 00:04:37.139
 because tension factor leaves 8,000 angels to the tourists a day that something up 

00:04:37.139 --> 00:04:40.759
 Wait therefore there is only one star in the stress factor 

00:04:42.229 --> 00:04:44.639
 the Reichstag is also something to police outside 

00:04:44.639 --> 00:04:45.770
 Who would have thought that 

00:04:45.770 --> 00:04:49.410
 I'm on my way again because the journey continues through the journey 

00:04:49.410 --> 00:04:50.780
 the most beautiful country in the world
