in<00:00:28.590> that<00:00:28.710> one<00:00:28.859> you<00:00:29.699> see<00:00:29.880> a<00:00:29.910> number<00:00:30.179> of<00:00:30.330> small

00:00:30.830 --> 00:00:30.840 
in that one you see a number of small

00:00:30.840 --> 00:00:35.270 
in that one you see a number of small

00:00:36.979 --> 00:00:36.989 
these wanted them to be very jungly semi

00:00:36.989 --> 00:00:39.080 
these wanted them to be very jungly semi
insured<00:00:37.230> they<00:00:37.350> had<00:00:37.500> lots<00:00:38.010> of<00:00:38.129> rivers<00:00:38.309> lots<00:00:38.969> of

Wembley<00:00:46.700> who<00:00:46.820> wanted<00:00:47.000> a<00:00:47.090> volcanic<00:00:47.390> island

00:00:47.680 --> 00:00:47.690 
Wembley who wanted a volcanic island

00:00:47.690 --> 00:00:49.900 
Wembley who wanted a volcanic island
they<00:00:48.410> tried<00:00:48.650> to<00:00:48.680> create<00:00:48.890> a<00:00:48.980> large<00:00:49.190> volcano<00:00:49.430> a

00:00:49.900 --> 00:00:49.910 
they tried to create a large volcano a

00:00:49.910 --> 00:00:52.900 
they tried to create a large volcano a
lot<00:00:50.690> of<00:00:50.840> sort<00:00:51.170> of<00:00:51.290> roots<00:00:52.250> of<00:00:52.490> the<00:00:52.550> mountain

00:00:52.900 --> 00:00:52.910 
lot of sort of roots of the mountain

00:00:52.910 --> 00:00:55.330 
lot of sort of roots of the mountain
moving<00:00:53.360> off<00:00:53.570> different<00:00:53.900> directions<00:00:54.260> my<00:00:55.160> first

00:00:55.330 --> 00:00:55.340 
moving off different directions my first

00:00:55.340 --> 00:00:57.280 
moving off different directions my first
time<00:00:55.580> trying<00:00:55.850> to<00:00:55.940> draw<00:00:56.150> volcano<00:00:56.660> I<00:00:56.840> think<00:00:57.200> it

00:00:57.280 --> 00:00:57.290 
time trying to draw volcano I think it

00:00:57.290 --> 00:00:59.470 
time trying to draw volcano I think it
turned<00:00:57.440> out<00:00:57.500> pretty<00:00:57.620> well<00:00:58.300> all<00:00:59.300> these

00:00:59.470 --> 00:00:59.480 
turned out pretty well all these

00:00:59.480 --> 00:01:00.880 
turned out pretty well all these
mountains<00:00:59.660> are<00:00:59.900> shown<00:01:00.110> straight<00:01:00.590> from<00:01:00.770> the

00:01:00.880 --> 00:01:00.890 
mountains are shown straight from the

00:01:00.890 --> 00:01:05.560 
mountains are shown straight from the
top<00:01:01.220> down<00:01:01.520> instead<00:01:02.270> of<00:01:02.360> at<00:01:02.510> a<00:01:02.650> 3d<00:01:03.650> angle<00:01:04.570> they

00:01:05.560 --> 00:01:05.570 
top down instead of at a 3d angle they

00:01:05.570 --> 00:01:06.820 
top down instead of at a 3d angle they
have<00:01:05.660> a<00:01:05.720> little<00:01:05.810> lake<00:01:06.080> system<00:01:06.290> here<00:01:06.590> which<00:01:06.740> I

00:01:06.820 --> 00:01:06.830 
have a little lake system here which I

00:01:06.830 --> 00:01:09.270 
have a little lake system here which I
like<00:01:06.979> to<00:01:07.040> have<00:01:07.850> a<00:01:08.030> rift<00:01:08.479> system<00:01:08.750> of<00:01:09.080> lakes

00:01:09.270 --> 00:01:09.280 
like to have a rift system of lakes

00:01:09.280 --> 00:01:11.440 
like to have a rift system of lakes
flowing<00:01:10.280> out<00:01:10.400> from<00:01:10.760> the<00:01:10.880> mountains<00:01:11.270> down

00:01:11.440 --> 00:01:11.450 
flowing out from the mountains down

00:01:11.450 --> 00:01:16.150 
flowing out from the mountains down
towards<00:01:11.810> the<00:01:11.930> ocean<00:01:14.650> small<00:01:15.650> mountain<00:01:15.950> range

00:01:16.150 --> 00:01:16.160 
towards the ocean small mountain range

00:01:16.160 --> 00:01:19.090 
towards the ocean small mountain range
there<00:01:16.460> a<00:01:16.759> large<00:01:17.690> area<00:01:17.960> full<00:01:18.290> of<00:01:18.410> forests<00:01:18.920> and

00:01:19.090 --> 00:01:19.100 
there a large area full of forests and

00:01:19.100 --> 00:01:23.910 
there a large area full of forests and
rivers<00:01:19.690> sneaking<00:01:20.690> their<00:01:20.869> way<00:01:20.990> out<00:01:21.170> to<00:01:21.200> the<00:01:21.380> sea

00:01:23.910 --> 00:01:23.920 

00:01:23.920 --> 00:01:26.920 

one<00:01:24.920> thing<00:01:25.100> I've<00:01:25.250> learned<00:01:25.729> about<00:01:25.970> drawing

00:01:26.920 --> 00:01:26.930 
one thing I've learned about drawing

00:01:26.930 --> 00:01:28.630 
one thing I've learned about drawing
these<00:01:27.200> types<00:01:27.470> of<00:01:27.560> mountains<00:01:27.950> is<00:01:28.430> that<00:01:28.550> you

00:01:28.630 --> 00:01:28.640 
these types of mountains is that you

00:01:28.640 --> 00:01:30.639 
these types of mountains is that you
need<00:01:28.790> to<00:01:28.880> have<00:01:29.030> more<00:01:29.300> detail<00:01:29.810> in<00:01:30.140> between<00:01:30.500> them

00:01:30.639 --> 00:01:30.649 
need to have more detail in between them

00:01:30.649 --> 00:01:33.730 
need to have more detail in between them
you<00:01:31.460> know<00:01:31.550> these<00:01:31.700> sort<00:01:31.970> of<00:01:32.060> short<00:01:32.840> rough

00:01:33.730 --> 00:01:33.740 
you know these sort of short rough

00:01:33.740 --> 00:01:36.190 
you know these sort of short rough
little<00:01:34.130> lines<00:01:34.369> they<00:01:35.330> represent<00:01:35.840> you<00:01:36.170> know

00:01:36.190 --> 00:01:36.200 
little lines they represent you know

00:01:36.200 --> 00:01:38.170 
little lines they represent you know
little<00:01:36.560> ridges<00:01:36.950> little<00:01:37.700> shapes<00:01:38.000> in<00:01:38.119> the

00:01:38.170 --> 00:01:38.180 
little ridges little shapes in the

00:01:38.180 --> 00:01:40.120 
little ridges little shapes in the
topography<00:01:38.750> and<00:01:38.960> it<00:01:39.560> makes<00:01:39.770> the<00:01:39.920> mountain

00:01:40.120 --> 00:01:40.130 
topography and it makes the mountain

00:01:40.130 --> 00:01:45.830 
topography and it makes the mountain
range<00:01:40.250> with<00:01:40.340> more<00:01:40.520> coherent

00:01:45.830 --> 00:01:45.840 

00:01:45.840 --> 00:01:47.870 

one<00:01:46.380> thing<00:01:46.530> I've<00:01:46.619> started<00:01:46.770> adding<00:01:46.979> is<00:01:47.220> in<00:01:47.579> some

00:01:47.870 --> 00:01:47.880 
one thing I've started adding is in some

00:01:47.880 --> 00:01:51.410 
one thing I've started adding is in some
places<00:01:48.090> these<00:01:48.420> little<00:01:49.220> ridges<00:01:50.220> are<00:01:50.970> near<00:01:51.299> the

00:01:51.410 --> 00:01:51.420 
places these little ridges are near the

00:01:51.420 --> 00:01:53.569 
places these little ridges are near the
coast<00:01:51.600> lines<00:01:51.950> and<00:01:52.950> they're<00:01:53.100> just<00:01:53.310> supposed<00:01:53.399> to

00:01:53.569 --> 00:01:53.579 
coast lines and they're just supposed to

00:01:53.579 --> 00:01:56.660 
coast lines and they're just supposed to
represent<00:01:53.750> higher<00:01:54.750> elevation<00:01:55.439> rocky<00:01:56.220> terrain

00:01:56.660 --> 00:01:56.670 
represent higher elevation rocky terrain

00:01:56.670 --> 00:01:59.450 
represent higher elevation rocky terrain
that<00:01:56.880> moves<00:01:57.060> up<00:01:57.210> quickly<00:01:57.590> it<00:01:58.590> seemed<00:01:58.890> a<00:01:59.159> good

00:01:59.450 --> 00:01:59.460 
that moves up quickly it seemed a good

00:01:59.460 --> 00:02:01.310 
that moves up quickly it seemed a good
way<00:01:59.789> to<00:01:59.850> draw<00:02:00.030> rough<00:02:00.479> terrain<00:02:00.810> and<00:02:01.110> turned<00:02:01.259> out

00:02:01.310 --> 00:02:01.320 
way to draw rough terrain and turned out

rough around the edges which is

00:02:14.760 --> 00:02:16.820 
rough around the edges which is
intentional<00:02:15.390> to<00:02:16.170> give<00:02:16.290> them<00:02:16.440> a<00:02:16.470> little<00:02:16.590> bit<00:02:16.739> of

one<00:02:31.050> little<00:02:31.230> island<00:02:31.440> they<00:02:32.220> are<00:02:32.340> there<00:02:32.459> at<00:02:32.550> the

00:02:32.610 --> 00:02:35.420 
one little island they are there at the
top<00:02:32.930> I've<00:02:33.930> also<00:02:34.110> started<00:02:34.349> drawing<00:02:34.680> compass

00:02:35.420 --> 00:02:35.430 
top I've also started drawing compass

00:02:35.430 --> 00:02:37.640 
top I've also started drawing compass
roses<00:02:35.760> for<00:02:35.910> some<00:02:36.000> of<00:02:36.090> these<00:02:36.180> maps<00:02:36.560> they<00:02:37.560> all

00:02:37.640 --> 00:02:37.650 
roses for some of these maps they all

00:02:37.650 --> 00:02:38.960 
roses for some of these maps they all
seem<00:02:37.800> to<00:02:37.830> have<00:02:37.890> a<00:02:38.010> different<00:02:38.280> compass<00:02:38.519> rose<00:02:38.670> I

00:02:38.960 --> 00:02:38.970 
seem to have a different compass rose I

00:02:38.970 --> 00:02:41.210 
seem to have a different compass rose I
kept<00:02:39.360> this<00:02:39.420> one<00:02:39.480> pretty<00:02:39.780> simple<00:02:40.110> but<00:02:40.950> I<00:02:41.010> like

00:02:41.210 --> 00:02:41.220 
kept this one pretty simple but I like

00:02:41.220 --> 00:02:45.589 
kept this one pretty simple but I like
the<00:02:41.310> simplicity<00:02:41.550> of<00:02:41.819> it<00:02:44.390> where's<00:02:45.390> the<00:02:45.480> whole

00:02:45.589 --> 00:02:45.599 
the simplicity of it where's the whole

00:02:45.599 --> 00:02:47.690 
the simplicity of it where's the whole
map<00:02:45.750> doesn't<00:02:46.379> really<00:02:46.500> have<00:02:46.650> a<00:02:46.680> name<00:02:46.830> yet<00:02:47.040> but<00:02:47.670> I

00:02:47.690 --> 00:02:47.700 
map doesn't really have a name yet but I

00:02:47.700 --> 00:02:50.120 
map doesn't really have a name yet but I
like<00:02:48.000> it<00:02:48.120> the<00:02:48.209> way<00:02:48.239> it<00:02:48.360> is<00:02:49.010> thanks<00:02:50.010> for
