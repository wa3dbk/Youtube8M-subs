00:01:28.550 --> 00:01:28.560 
I came up with it just thinking out of

00:01:28.560 --> 00:01:30.530 
I came up with it just thinking out of
the<00:01:28.650> blue<00:01:28.830> what<00:01:29.369> color<00:01:29.400> palette<00:01:30.150> would<00:01:30.360> work

00:01:30.530 --> 00:01:30.540 
the blue what color palette would work

00:01:30.540 --> 00:01:33.020 
the blue what color palette would work
best<00:01:30.900> for<00:01:31.320> brides<00:01:31.560> and<00:01:31.979> that's<00:01:32.610> inexpensive

00:01:33.020 --> 00:01:33.030 
best for brides and that's inexpensive

00:01:33.030 --> 00:01:36.620 
best for brides and that's inexpensive
and<00:01:33.509> green<00:01:34.290> came<00:01:34.920> to<00:01:35.070> my<00:01:35.159> mind<00:01:35.310> flower<00:01:36.180> foliage

00:01:36.620 --> 00:01:36.630 
and green came to my mind flower foliage

00:01:36.630 --> 00:01:38.420 
and green came to my mind flower foliage
is<00:01:36.900> always<00:01:37.200> green<00:01:37.470> every<00:01:38.070> time<00:01:38.190> you<00:01:38.310> have<00:01:38.400> a

00:01:38.420 --> 00:01:38.430 
is always green every time you have a

00:01:38.430 --> 00:01:40.219 
is always green every time you have a
centerpiece<00:01:38.790> you<00:01:38.970> got<00:01:39.090> green<00:01:39.360> to<00:01:39.570> it<00:01:39.690> so

00:01:40.219 --> 00:01:40.229 
centerpiece you got green to it so

00:01:40.229 --> 00:01:41.899 
centerpiece you got green to it so
that's<00:01:40.470> kind<00:01:40.710> of<00:01:40.770> how<00:01:40.950> the<00:01:41.009> whole<00:01:41.280> concept

00:01:41.899 --> 00:01:41.909 
that's kind of how the whole concept

00:01:41.909 --> 00:01:44.210 
that's kind of how the whole concept
came<00:01:42.119> about<00:01:42.330> and<00:01:42.690> still<00:01:42.990> like<00:01:43.290> December<00:01:44.070> when

00:01:44.210 --> 00:01:44.220 
came about and still like December when

00:01:44.220 --> 00:01:45.980 
came about and still like December when
I<00:01:44.250> found<00:01:44.490> out<00:01:44.670> emerald<00:01:45.270> is<00:01:45.420> like<00:01:45.600> the<00:01:45.750> key

00:01:45.980 --> 00:01:45.990 
I found out emerald is like the key

00:01:45.990 --> 00:01:48.980 
I found out emerald is like the key
green<00:01:46.399> everyone's<00:01:47.399> using<00:01:47.610> for<00:01:48.420> wedding<00:01:48.720> so<00:01:48.960> I

00:01:48.980 --> 00:01:48.990 
green everyone's using for wedding so I

00:01:48.990 --> 00:01:56.560 
green everyone's using for wedding so I

00:01:56.570 --> 00:01:59.830 

I<00:01:56.659> think<00:01:57.590> the<00:01:57.770> vendors<00:01:58.280> just<00:01:59.120> kind<00:01:59.479> of<00:01:59.570> by

00:01:59.830 --> 00:01:59.840 
I think the vendors just kind of by

00:01:59.840 --> 00:02:01.960 
I think the vendors just kind of by
looking<00:02:00.440> at<00:02:00.530> their<00:02:00.740> work<00:02:00.920> and<00:02:01.250> seeing<00:02:01.520> how<00:02:01.790> it

00:02:01.960 --> 00:02:01.970 
looking at their work and seeing how it

00:02:01.970 --> 00:02:04.149 
looking at their work and seeing how it
would<00:02:02.120> fit<00:02:02.300> within<00:02:02.540> the<00:02:02.780> shoe<00:02:03.020> and<00:02:03.440> I<00:02:04.100> know

00:03:33.770 --> 00:03:36.880 
that they can take with them for a long
time<00:03:34.100> so<00:03:34.640> like<00:03:35.480> photography<00:03:35.870> that<00:03:36.590> will<00:03:36.740> be

00:03:36.880 --> 00:03:36.890 
time so like photography that will be

00:03:36.890 --> 00:03:38.440 
time so like photography that will be
something<00:03:37.310> that<00:03:37.610> they'll<00:03:37.790> have<00:03:38.000> for<00:03:38.240> the<00:03:38.300> rest

00:03:48.310 --> 00:03:48.320 
on so I can little investment but it

00:03:48.320 --> 00:03:50.560 
on so I can little investment but it
pays<00:03:48.590> off<00:03:48.820> even<00:03:49.820> though<00:03:49.940> we're<00:03:50.150> part<00:03:50.390> of<00:03:50.450> the

00:03:50.560 --> 00:03:50.570

00:04:10.090 --> 00:04:10.100 
a real big thing so I think we're going

a real big thing so I think we're going
to<00:04:10.190> start<00:04:10.370> seeing<00:04:10.640> that<00:04:10.790> more<00:04:11.000> and<00:04:11.060> more

00:04:19.259 --> 00:04:19.269 

00:04:19.269 --> 00:04:22.800 

Oh<00:04:20.069> most<00:04:21.069> challenging<00:04:21.699> part<00:04:21.970> was<00:04:22.210> trying<00:04:22.629> to

00:04:22.800 --> 00:04:22.810 
Oh most challenging part was trying to

00:04:22.810 --> 00:04:24.900 
Oh most challenging part was trying to
figure<00:04:23.110> out<00:04:23.169> how<00:04:23.379> to<00:04:23.440> incorporate<00:04:23.919> the<00:04:24.580> greens

00:04:24.900 --> 00:04:24.910 
figure out how to incorporate the greens

00:04:24.910 --> 00:04:28.020 
figure out how to incorporate the greens
in<00:04:25.240> each<00:04:25.599> season<00:04:25.930> and<00:04:26.410> what<00:04:26.949> shape<00:04:27.250> to<00:04:27.460> use<00:04:27.669> I

00:04:28.020 --> 00:04:28.030 
in each season and what shape to use I

00:04:28.030 --> 00:04:30.420 
in each season and what shape to use I
mean<00:04:28.840> there's<00:04:29.199> tens<00:04:29.740> of<00:04:29.889> thousands<00:04:30.370> of

00:04:30.420 --> 00:04:30.430 
mean there's tens of thousands of

00:04:30.430 --> 00:04:33.149 
mean there's tens of thousands of
different<00:04:30.580> shades<00:04:30.909> of<00:04:31.030> green<00:04:31.240> so<00:04:32.009> with<00:04:33.009> the

00:04:33.149 --> 00:04:33.159 
different shades of green so with the

00:04:33.159 --> 00:04:34.890 
different shades of green so with the
shoot<00:04:33.460> it<00:04:33.669> was<00:04:33.819> all<00:04:33.940> about<00:04:34.180> do<00:04:34.449> I<00:04:34.539> use<00:04:34.720> the

00:04:34.890 --> 00:04:34.900 
shoot it was all about do I use the

00:04:34.900 --> 00:04:36.450 
shoot it was all about do I use the
light<00:04:35.080> green<00:04:35.409> so<00:04:35.710> I<00:04:35.740> use<00:04:35.889> the<00:04:36.009> darker<00:04:36.159> greens

00:04:36.450 --> 00:04:36.460 
light green so I use the darker greens

00:04:36.460 --> 00:04:40.529 
light green so I use the darker greens
or<00:04:36.669> a<00:04:36.729> mixture<00:04:37.030> it's<00:04:37.509> really<00:04:38.199> time<00:04:39.330> the<00:04:40.330> most

00:04:40.529 --> 00:04:40.539 
or a mixture it's really time the most

00:04:40.539 --> 00:04:43.320 
or a mixture it's really time the most
challenging<00:04:41.020> part<00:04:41.289> was<00:04:41.879> selecting<00:04:42.879> a<00:04:42.970> venue

00:04:43.320 --> 00:04:43.330 
challenging part was selecting a venue

00:04:43.330 --> 00:04:46.020 
challenging part was selecting a venue
that<00:04:43.539> was<00:04:43.960> that<00:04:44.770> had<00:04:44.919> a<00:04:44.949> nice<00:04:45.220> backdrop<00:04:45.699> and

00:04:46.020 --> 00:04:46.030 
that was that had a nice backdrop and

00:04:46.030 --> 00:04:49.350 
that was that had a nice backdrop and
there<00:04:46.599> weren't<00:04:46.889> many<00:04:47.889> photos<00:04:48.400> that<00:04:49.210> were

00:04:49.350 --> 00:04:49.360 
there weren't many photos that were

00:04:49.360 --> 00:04:51.629 
there weren't many photos that were
taken<00:04:49.389> so<00:04:50.080> this<00:04:50.379> is<00:04:50.530> the<00:04:50.650> perfect<00:04:50.860> venue<00:04:51.430> for

00:04:51.629 --> 00:04:51.639 
taken so this is the perfect venue for

00:04:51.639 --> 00:05:03.920 
taken so this is the perfect venue for
us

00:05:03.920 --> 00:05:03.930 

00:05:03.930 --> 00:05:07.020

I've done small little weddings for a
couple<00:05:07.390> hundred<00:05:07.510> dollars<00:05:07.990> I've<00:05:08.620> done<00:05:08.950> really

00:05:09.780 --> 00:05:09.790 
couple hundred dollars I've done really

00:05:09.790 --> 00:05:11.520 
couple hundred dollars I've done really
large<00:05:10.090> weddings<00:05:10.660> in<00:05:11.050> the

00:05:11.520 --> 00:05:11.530 
large weddings in the

00:05:11.530 --> 00:05:13.740 
large weddings in the
hundred-thousand-dollar<00:05:12.280> range<00:05:12.850> just<00:05:13.510> for

00:05:13.740 --> 00:05:13.750 
hundred-thousand-dollar range just for

00:05:13.750 --> 00:05:15.630 
hundred-thousand-dollar range just for
the<00:05:13.810> flowers<00:05:14.290> I've<00:05:14.560> done<00:05:15.040> everything<00:05:15.340> in

the flowers I've done everything in

00:05:15.640 --> 00:05:21.240 
the flowers I've done everything in
between<00:05:17.040> so<00:05:18.040> I<00:05:18.070> think<00:05:18.310> the<00:05:18.610> biggest<00:05:18.910> thing<00:05:20.250> for

00:05:21.240 --> 00:05:21.250
