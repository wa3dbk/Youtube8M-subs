by default the things you don't need get

00:01:22.759 --> 00:01:25.120 
by default the things you don't need get
rid<00:01:22.789> of<00:01:23.000> it<00:01:23.179> because<00:01:23.420> this<00:01:23.959> causes<00:01:24.440> a<00:01:24.679> lot<00:01:24.830> of

00:01:25.120 --> 00:01:25.130 
rid of it because this causes a lot of

00:01:25.130 --> 00:01:27.639 
rid of it because this causes a lot of
battery<00:01:25.759> drain<00:01:25.789> and<00:01:26.390> that's<00:01:27.080> actually<00:01:27.380> the

00:01:27.639 --> 00:01:27.649 
battery drain and that's actually the

00:01:27.649 --> 00:01:29.859 
battery drain and that's actually the
reason<00:01:27.800> why<00:01:28.069> I<00:01:28.490> get<00:01:29.209> rid<00:01:29.390> of<00:01:29.420> everything

00:01:29.859 --> 00:01:29.869 
reason why I get rid of everything
