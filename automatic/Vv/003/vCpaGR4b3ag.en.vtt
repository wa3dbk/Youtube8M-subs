00:00:02.159 --> 00:00:05.430
 saturday of club students we were 

00:00:03.929 --> 00:00:08.509
 there we talked with the make-up artist 

00:00:05.430 --> 00:00:08.509
 let's go to this first part 

00:00:08.620 --> 00:00:14.110
 that would be where so high level file 

00:00:11.350 --> 00:00:16.420
 if there was not a very good make-up artist 

00:00:14.110 --> 00:00:18.160
 look what I just said july thank you 

00:00:16.420 --> 00:00:20.050

00:00:18.160 --> 00:00:20.800
 the hair but the face dear but it is 

00:00:20.050 --> 00:00:22.900
 important 

00:00:20.800 --> 00:00:24.640
 also look that we do not have some 

00:00:22.900 --> 00:00:27.910
 divine beauties but you finish them 

00:00:24.640 --> 00:00:30.460
 to enaltecer we made a nice makeup 

00:00:27.910 --> 00:00:32.980
 Marking the eyes bronze golden 

00:00:30.460 --> 00:00:34.329
 black something gloss she still does not 

00:00:32.980 --> 00:00:35.980
 has because in a little while we are 

00:00:34.329 --> 00:00:37.989
 finishing his makeup we are in the 

00:00:35.980 --> 00:00:39.640
 back and those are the trends these are 

00:00:37.989 --> 00:00:41.289
 the trends for winter eyes 

00:00:39.640 --> 00:00:43.949
 well-marked eyes well black as 

00:00:41.289 --> 00:00:43.949
 we have also 

00:00:44.370 --> 00:00:47.670
 I'm going to retouch, we rethink everything 

00:00:46.199 --> 00:00:49.920
 I do not want to leave badly either because if 

00:00:47.670 --> 00:00:51.750
 we are to the bonus you painted me then the 

00:00:49.920 --> 00:00:53.940
 tendency is to mark the eyes well and 

00:00:51.750 --> 00:00:55.860
 we mark the eyes well the mouth the mouth 

00:00:53.940 --> 00:00:58.019
 more calmly marking your eyes a lot 

00:00:55.860 --> 00:01:00.720
 many lashes and remember the 

00:00:58.019 --> 00:01:02.879
 tab to arch with the river and 

00:01:00.720 --> 00:01:04.710
 false eyelashes where possible in what 

00:01:02.879 --> 00:01:06.149
 possible it seems cheeks that we can 

00:01:04.710 --> 00:01:08.130
 do to the day night also depends 

00:01:06.149 --> 00:01:09.960
 As we fix it, I always say that 

00:01:08.130 --> 00:01:12.149
 attitude there that you can use all 

00:01:09.960 --> 00:01:13.530
 Evening day I liked at 7 

00:01:12.149 --> 00:01:17.210
