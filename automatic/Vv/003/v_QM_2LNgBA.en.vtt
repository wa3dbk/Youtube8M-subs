00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.340
 the nonexistent apartment 

00:00:06.220 --> 00:00:16.719
 and I must stay firm in quantity 

00:00:21.770 --> 00:00:26.940
 while you are saving a lot of the 

00:00:24.540 --> 00:00:29.730
 I'm thinking about leaving home leave 

00:00:26.940 --> 00:00:32.130
 from home I would like to check up 

00:00:29.730 --> 00:00:34.260
 where does my own strength come in that the 

00:00:32.130 --> 00:00:36.660
 sense I think it depends too much on 

00:00:34.260 --> 00:00:38.340
 my parents and that bothers me for that 

00:00:36.660 --> 00:00:40.440
 I'm thinking of trying to live alone in 

00:00:38.340 --> 00:00:42.180
 an apartment but I still have not 

00:00:40.440 --> 00:00:44.430
 saved enough money for it 

00:00:42.180 --> 00:00:47.870
 you know how to get financial independence 

00:00:44.430 --> 00:00:47.870
 It's not easy, no 

00:00:49.020 --> 00:00:53.610
 it's amazing that a kid like you 

00:00:51.420 --> 00:00:55.890
 lack of will and little scholar 

00:00:53.610 --> 00:00:57.810
 I want to risk leaving home 

00:00:55.890 --> 00:01:00.210
 you will find an apartment 

00:00:57.810 --> 00:01:03.360
 I do not have that much money but it will help you 

00:01:00.210 --> 00:01:08.010
 to leave home you can get it for free 

00:01:03.360 --> 00:01:10.200
 in serviu the landlord is worried 

00:01:08.010 --> 00:01:12.360
 because he thinks that number 4 brings bad 

00:01:10.200 --> 00:01:15.840
 luck for that after the apartment 

00:01:12.360 --> 00:01:17.640
 number 3 is number 5 so 

00:01:15.840 --> 00:01:20.070
 we can use the door of a 

00:01:17.640 --> 00:01:23.220
 non-existent room join it to a 

00:01:20.070 --> 00:01:25.259
 wall and create an apartment the interior 

00:01:23.220 --> 00:01:27.060
 will be like the others and when you close the 

00:01:25.259 --> 00:01:30.140
 door will again be a wall like 

00:01:27.060 --> 00:01:33.450
 before this room will be your castle 

00:01:30.140 --> 00:01:37.619
 fantastic so you will have a strength to 

00:01:33.450 --> 00:01:39.780
 I'll just move in right now even though my 

00:01:37.619 --> 00:01:41.040
 mom will worry when she sees that 

00:01:39.780 --> 00:01:43.020
 he came back 

00:01:41.040 --> 00:01:45.149
 good it will not be bad to worry about a 

00:01:43.020 --> 00:01:49.009
 little so they will realize what 

00:01:45.149 --> 00:01:49.009
 very important that his only son 

00:01:57.329 --> 00:02:04.840
 I am free live in gaining day with luck 

00:02:02.649 --> 00:02:06.939
 I have to have a place for myself 

00:02:04.840 --> 00:02:10.680
 doraemon hears your desire for independence 

00:02:06.939 --> 00:02:14.170
 it would not be to do nothing to 

00:02:10.680 --> 00:02:18.250
 who are you and who are here and have 

00:02:14.170 --> 00:02:20.739
 this I live in apartment 5 this is 

00:02:18.250 --> 00:02:22.510
 the apartment number 4 or a and I am very 

00:02:20.739 --> 00:02:23.950
 distracted he had not seen the apartment 

00:02:22.510 --> 00:02:25.510
 4 

00:02:23.950 --> 00:02:28.030
 you must remove the door if not the 

00:02:25.510 --> 00:02:32.580
 Owner will ask for a rental 

00:02:28.030 --> 00:02:32.580
 reason the departments at number 5 

00:02:34.790 --> 00:02:37.629
 and everyone 

00:02:37.880 --> 00:02:42.020
 I would like to know if mom has given 

00:02:40.130 --> 00:02:44.090
 I already know that I've left home 

00:02:42.020 --> 00:02:46.310
 Maybe he regrets having given me 

00:02:44.090 --> 00:02:49.280
 so much and of not wanting to give me ever money 

00:02:46.310 --> 00:02:51.110
 I would like to know, I am sure that 

00:02:49.280 --> 00:02:54.470
 my friends were very impressed by my 

00:02:51.110 --> 00:02:56.450
 value and my good ability that's here 

00:02:54.470 --> 00:02:58.070
 because it's not good that I've rented a 

00:02:56.450 --> 00:03:00.190
 apartment you can come with our 

00:02:58.070 --> 00:03:00.190
 friends 

00:03:01.400 --> 00:03:06.730
 if you thought it was a joke that is 

00:03:04.189 --> 00:03:06.730
 natural 

00:03:08.970 --> 00:03:14.580
 and I told you that apartment 4 does not 

00:03:12.660 --> 00:03:16.580
 exists 

00:03:14.580 --> 00:03:19.520
 I am 

00:03:16.580 --> 00:03:21.620
 department 4 I am the owner of 

00:03:19.520 --> 00:03:23.750
 this building and I say that number 4 does not 

00:03:21.620 --> 00:03:26.480
 there is 4 brings me bad luck and now 

00:03:23.750 --> 00:03:28.879
 go home we go go 

00:03:26.480 --> 00:03:31.450
 and you can never trust what he says 

00:03:28.879 --> 00:03:31.450
 no vita 

00:03:36.069 --> 00:03:39.069
 yes 

00:03:40.450 --> 00:03:42.629
 there 

00:03:44.470 --> 00:03:49.100
 d 

00:03:46.490 --> 00:03:52.550
 I do not understand it because he started running 

00:03:49.100 --> 00:03:54.080
 Once you see me you will not believe that you can 

00:03:52.550 --> 00:03:56.420
 be all day with arms 

00:03:54.080 --> 00:03:58.010
 crossed I have to make a mountain of 

00:03:56.420 --> 00:04:00.349
 homework 

00:03:58.010 --> 00:04:02.090
 what happens is that I'm used to 

00:04:00.349 --> 00:04:04.579
 do them after my mom has 

00:04:02.090 --> 00:04:07.130
 angry because I have not done them and because 

00:04:04.579 --> 00:04:12.490
 that are still undone 

00:04:07.130 --> 00:04:12.490

00:04:14.250 --> 00:04:20.310

00:04:17.730 --> 00:04:23.340

00:04:30.340 --> 00:04:36.570

00:05:15.509 --> 00:05:19.590
