so first what you're going to do is
apply<00:00:11.710> heat<00:00:12.219> protectant<00:00:12.790> and<00:00:12.910> I'm<00:00:13.059> trying<00:00:13.389> to

00:00:13.440 --> 00:00:13.450 
apply heat protectant and I'm trying to

00:00:13.450 --> 00:00:16.620 
apply heat protectant and I'm trying to
keep<00:00:13.690> my<00:00:13.929> hair<00:00:14.200> healthy<00:00:14.230> so<00:00:15.070> I'm<00:00:15.849> applying<00:00:16.450> a

00:00:16.620 --> 00:00:16.630 
keep my hair healthy so I'm applying a

00:00:16.630 --> 00:00:18.510 
keep my hair healthy so I'm applying a
generous<00:00:16.810> amount<00:00:17.230> of<00:00:17.410> that<00:00:17.560> and<00:00:17.830> then<00:00:18.009> section

00:00:18.510 --> 00:00:18.520 
generous amount of that and then section

00:00:18.520 --> 00:00:21.150 
generous amount of that and then section
about<00:00:18.730> a<00:00:18.790> one-inch<00:00:19.330> section<00:00:20.050> and<00:00:20.410> start<00:00:21.040> at

00:00:21.150 --> 00:00:21.160 
about a one-inch section and start at

00:00:21.160 --> 00:00:23.069 
about a one-inch section and start at
the<00:00:21.189> middle<00:00:21.489> of<00:00:21.669> the<00:00:21.759> section<00:00:22.000> roll<00:00:22.750> a<00:00:22.779> little

00:00:23.069 --> 00:00:23.079 
the middle of the section roll a little

00:00:23.079 --> 00:00:24.749 
the middle of the section roll a little
little<00:00:23.259> and<00:00:23.470> then<00:00:23.590> pull<00:00:23.829> it<00:00:23.980> outward<00:00:24.189> to<00:00:24.640> the

00:00:24.749 --> 00:00:24.759 
little and then pull it outward to the

00:00:24.759 --> 00:00:27.990 
little and then pull it outward to the
ends<00:00:25.180> that<00:00:25.660> way<00:00:25.899> you<00:00:25.960> can<00:00:26.380> get<00:00:26.590> the<00:00:26.980> end<00:00:27.189> and

00:00:27.990 --> 00:00:28.000 
ends that way you can get the end and

00:00:28.000 --> 00:00:31.109 
ends that way you can get the end and
not<00:00:28.509> damage<00:00:29.050> your<00:00:29.230> hair<00:00:29.380> as<00:00:29.500> much<00:00:30.119> usually

00:00:31.109 --> 00:00:31.119 
not damage your hair as much usually

00:00:31.119 --> 00:00:33.510 
not damage your hair as much usually
what<00:00:31.540> I<00:00:31.570> like<00:00:31.630> to<00:00:31.930> do<00:00:32.079> is<00:00:32.349> feel<00:00:32.710> the<00:00:32.920> iron<00:00:33.130> with

00:00:33.510 --> 00:00:33.520 
what I like to do is feel the iron with

00:00:33.520 --> 00:00:36.090 
what I like to do is feel the iron with
my<00:00:33.700> finger<00:00:34.090> to<00:00:34.300> see<00:00:34.510> if<00:00:34.630> it's<00:00:34.750> hot<00:00:34.960> enough<00:00:35.230> so

00:00:36.090 --> 00:00:36.100 
my finger to see if it's hot enough so

00:00:36.100 --> 00:00:39.270 
my finger to see if it's hot enough so
then<00:00:36.280> once<00:00:36.910> it's<00:00:37.180> kind<00:00:37.450> of<00:00:37.600> hot<00:00:38.350> enough<00:00:38.680> then<00:00:39.100> I

00:00:39.270 --> 00:00:39.280 
then once it's kind of hot enough then I

00:00:39.280 --> 00:00:42.870 
then once it's kind of hot enough then I
will<00:00:39.640> just<00:00:39.880> unravel<00:00:40.690> the<00:00:40.840> curl<00:00:41.050> I<00:00:41.880> usually

00:00:42.870 --> 00:00:42.880 
will just unravel the curl I usually

00:00:42.880 --> 00:00:44.700 
will just unravel the curl I usually
hold<00:00:43.090> it<00:00:43.330> in<00:00:43.540> there<00:00:43.840> if<00:00:44.080> I<00:00:44.170> had<00:00:44.380> to<00:00:44.560> estimate

00:00:44.700 --> 00:00:44.710 
hold it in there if I had to estimate

00:00:44.710 --> 00:00:49.560 
hold it in there if I had to estimate
for<00:00:45.400> about<00:00:45.700> five<00:00:46.470> seconds<00:00:47.490> to<00:00:48.490> eight<00:00:48.970> seconds

00:00:49.560 --> 00:00:49.570 
for about five seconds to eight seconds

00:00:49.570 --> 00:00:51.840 
for about five seconds to eight seconds
I'd<00:00:49.780> say<00:00:50.020> now<00:00:50.829> the<00:00:50.890> rest<00:00:51.220> is<00:00:51.340> very<00:00:51.640> repetitive

00:00:51.840 --> 00:00:51.850 
I'd say now the rest is very repetitive

00:00:51.850 --> 00:00:55.860 
I'd say now the rest is very repetitive
I<00:00:52.510> have<00:00:52.690> to<00:00:52.810> do<00:00:52.990> is<00:00:53.460> curl<00:00:54.460> it<00:00:54.700> and<00:00:54.730> then<00:00:55.180> what<00:00:55.570> I

00:00:55.860 --> 00:00:55.870 
I have to do is curl it and then what I

00:00:55.870 --> 00:00:59.069 
I have to do is curl it and then what I
do<00:00:55.930> is<00:00:56.110> put<00:00:56.590> a<00:00:56.860> curl<00:00:57.370> that's<00:00:57.700> done<00:00:58.060> behind<00:00:58.540> me

00:00:59.069 --> 00:00:59.079 
do is put a curl that's done behind me

00:00:59.079 --> 00:01:02.010 
do is put a curl that's done behind me
so<00:00:59.470> that<00:00:59.680> I<00:01:00.070> don't<00:01:00.520> get<00:01:01.150> them<00:01:01.360> all<00:01:01.510> mixed<00:01:01.750> up

00:01:02.010 --> 00:01:02.020 
so that I don't get them all mixed up

00:01:02.020 --> 00:01:04.109 
so that I don't get them all mixed up
and<00:01:02.320> all<00:01:02.590> messy<00:01:03.100> looking<00:01:03.460> because<00:01:03.670> I<00:01:03.820> want<00:01:04.000> the

00:01:04.109 --> 00:01:04.119 
and all messy looking because I want the

00:01:04.119 --> 00:01:07.440 
and all messy looking because I want the
curls<00:01:04.390> to<00:01:04.600> kind<00:01:04.839> of<00:01:05.049> be<00:01:05.740> very<00:01:06.130> nice<00:01:06.490> and<00:01:06.820> tamed

00:01:07.440 --> 00:01:07.450 
curls to kind of be very nice and tamed

00:01:07.450 --> 00:01:09.780 
curls to kind of be very nice and tamed
another<00:01:08.170> thing<00:01:08.530> I<00:01:08.619> also<00:01:08.799> did<00:01:09.159> while<00:01:09.400> curling

00:01:09.780 --> 00:01:09.790 
another thing I also did while curling

00:01:09.790 --> 00:01:12.180 
another thing I also did while curling
my<00:01:09.909> hair<00:01:09.940> was<00:01:10.360> section<00:01:10.840> it<00:01:10.960> in<00:01:11.290> to<00:01:11.680> and<00:01:12.040> then

00:01:12.180 --> 00:01:12.190 
my hair was section it in to and then

00:01:12.190 --> 00:01:15.930 
my hair was section it in to and then
started<00:01:12.729> at<00:01:13.210> the<00:01:13.780> back<00:01:14.440> of<00:01:14.770> one<00:01:14.860> side<00:01:15.460> and<00:01:15.490> then

00:01:15.930 --> 00:01:15.940 
started at the back of one side and then

00:01:15.940 --> 00:01:19.260 
started at the back of one side and then
work<00:01:16.180> myself<00:01:16.390> up<00:01:17.140> to<00:01:17.470> the<00:01:17.560> front<00:01:17.800> oh<00:01:18.220> yeah<00:01:19.120> and

00:01:19.260 --> 00:01:19.270 
work myself up to the front oh yeah and

00:01:19.270 --> 00:01:20.640 
work myself up to the front oh yeah and
I<00:01:19.300> forgot<00:01:19.570> to<00:01:19.720> mention<00:01:19.870> that<00:01:20.170> the<00:01:20.380> curling

00:01:20.640 --> 00:01:20.650 
I forgot to mention that the curling

00:01:20.650 --> 00:01:24.000 
I forgot to mention that the curling
iron<00:01:20.860> I'm<00:01:21.130> using<00:01:21.400> is<00:01:21.850> a<00:01:21.880> 1<00:01:22.330> and<00:01:22.540> 1/4<00:01:23.049> inch<00:01:23.409> hot

00:01:24.000 --> 00:01:24.010 
iron I'm using is a 1 and 1/4 inch hot

00:01:24.010 --> 00:01:26.100 
iron I'm using is a 1 and 1/4 inch hot
tools<00:01:24.340> curling<00:01:24.850> iron<00:01:25.060> it's<00:01:25.690> probably<00:01:26.020> the

00:01:26.100 --> 00:01:26.110 
tools curling iron it's probably the

00:01:26.110 --> 00:01:28.500 
tools curling iron it's probably the
biggest<00:01:26.320> barrel<00:01:26.860> I<00:01:27.010> can<00:01:27.190> use<00:01:27.460> without<00:01:27.700> having

00:01:28.500 --> 00:01:28.510 
biggest barrel I can use without having

00:01:28.510 --> 00:01:31.469 
biggest barrel I can use without having
the<00:01:29.440> curl<00:01:29.650> not<00:01:29.920> hold<00:01:30.310> because<00:01:30.580> usually<00:01:30.880> when<00:01:31.450> I

00:01:31.469 --> 00:01:31.479 
the curl not hold because usually when I

00:01:31.479 --> 00:01:33.899 
the curl not hold because usually when I
go<00:01:31.870> bigger<00:01:32.320> than<00:01:32.620> that<00:01:32.799> size<00:01:33.070> it<00:01:33.460> curls

00:01:33.899 --> 00:01:33.909 
go bigger than that size it curls

00:01:33.909 --> 00:01:35.700 
go bigger than that size it curls
wouldn't<00:01:34.720> hold<00:01:34.930> as<00:01:35.140> long<00:01:35.350> and<00:01:35.470> it<00:01:35.530> would<00:01:35.650> just

00:01:35.700 --> 00:01:35.710 
wouldn't hold as long and it would just

00:01:35.710 --> 00:01:38.789 
wouldn't hold as long and it would just
turn<00:01:36.040> into<00:01:36.220> a<00:01:36.340> limp<00:01:36.610> wave<00:01:36.940> also<00:01:37.900> another<00:01:38.470> tip

00:01:38.789 --> 00:01:38.799 
turn into a limp wave also another tip

00:01:38.799 --> 00:01:41.609 
turn into a limp wave also another tip
to<00:01:38.860> those<00:01:39.310> who<00:01:39.700> don't<00:01:40.150> have<00:01:40.360> here<00:01:40.900> that<00:01:41.170> holds

00:01:41.609 --> 00:01:41.619 
to those who don't have here that holds

00:01:41.619 --> 00:01:43.890 
to those who don't have here that holds
curls<00:01:41.890> very<00:01:42.250> well<00:01:42.549> what<00:01:43.330> you<00:01:43.450> should<00:01:43.479> most

00:01:43.890 --> 00:01:43.900 
curls very well what you should most

00:01:43.900 --> 00:01:46.080 
curls very well what you should most
likely<00:01:44.440> do<00:01:44.650> is<00:01:45.070> when<00:01:45.400> your<00:01:45.520> hair<00:01:45.700> is<00:01:45.729> damp

00:01:46.080 --> 00:01:46.090 
likely do is when your hair is damp

00:01:46.090 --> 00:01:48.990 
likely do is when your hair is damp
apply<00:01:46.659> mousse<00:01:47.020> all<00:01:47.290> over<00:01:47.799> it<00:01:47.950> so<00:01:48.520> that<00:01:48.700> when<00:01:48.880> it

00:01:48.990 --> 00:01:49.000 
apply mousse all over it so that when it

00:01:49.000 --> 00:01:49.800 
apply mousse all over it so that when it
dries

00:01:49.800 --> 00:01:49.810 
dries

00:01:49.810 --> 00:01:51.510 
dries
there's<00:01:50.049> mousse<00:01:50.409> in<00:01:50.619> it<00:01:50.710> but<00:01:50.920> it's<00:01:51.040> not<00:01:51.189> hard

00:01:51.510 --> 00:01:51.520 
there's mousse in it but it's not hard

00:01:51.520 --> 00:01:53.609 
there's mousse in it but it's not hard
and<00:01:51.610> crunchy<00:01:51.880> so<00:01:52.330> when<00:01:52.510> you<00:01:52.689> curl<00:01:53.080> your<00:01:53.110> hair

00:01:53.609 --> 00:01:53.619 
and crunchy so when you curl your hair

00:01:53.619 --> 00:01:57.600 
and crunchy so when you curl your hair
the<00:01:54.159> curls<00:01:54.369> are<00:01:54.640> able<00:01:55.090> to<00:01:55.229> hold<00:01:56.229> for<00:01:57.010> a<00:01:57.040> longer

00:01:57.600 --> 00:01:57.610 
the curls are able to hold for a longer

00:01:57.610 --> 00:01:59.609 
the curls are able to hold for a longer
period<00:01:57.640> of<00:01:58.030> time<00:01:58.240> and<00:01:58.479> also<00:01:58.780> you<00:01:58.869> can<00:01:59.170> always

00:01:59.609 --> 00:01:59.619 
period of time and also you can always

00:01:59.619 --> 00:02:02.010 
period of time and also you can always
spray<00:02:00.580> it<00:02:00.820> with<00:02:01.420> hairspray

00:02:02.010 --> 00:02:02.020 
spray it with hairspray

00:02:25.790 --> 00:02:25.800 
about two three times and then I would

00:02:25.800 --> 00:02:27.730 
about two three times and then I would
tease<00:02:26.070> it<00:02:26.310> and<00:02:26.550> then<00:02:26.700> repeat<00:02:27.120> all<00:02:27.360> the<00:02:27.630> steps

00:02:31.610 --> 00:02:31.620 
to about half way through my hair so I'm

00:02:31.620 --> 00:02:34.010 
to about half way through my hair so I'm
just<00:02:31.800> basically<00:02:32.010> teasing<00:02:32.880> that<00:02:33.060> top<00:02:33.569> half<00:02:33.900> of

00:02:34.010 --> 00:02:34.020

00:02:40.460 --> 00:02:40.470 
because by by then it should be enough

00:02:40.470 --> 00:02:44.110 
because by by then it should be enough
