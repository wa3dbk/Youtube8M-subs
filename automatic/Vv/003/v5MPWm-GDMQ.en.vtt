so<00:02:58.770> index<00:02:59.220> roll<00:02:59.550> and<00:02:59.760> catch<00:03:00.000> with<00:03:00.210> my<00:03:00.360> thumb

00:03:00.590 --> 00:03:00.600 
so index roll and catch with my thumb

00:03:00.600 --> 00:03:02.510 
so index roll and catch with my thumb
right<00:03:00.750> there

00:03:02.510 --> 00:03:02.520 
right there

00:03:02.520 --> 00:03:06.170 
right there
so<00:03:03.000> now<00:03:03.900> from<00:03:04.200> here<00:03:04.440> I<00:03:04.500> will<00:03:04.740> be<00:03:04.890> doing<00:03:05.190> a<00:03:05.550> thumb

00:03:06.170 --> 00:03:06.180 
so now from here I will be doing a thumb

00:03:06.180 --> 00:03:12.110 
so now from here I will be doing a thumb
Chaplin<00:03:06.990> roll<00:03:07.350> around<00:03:07.500> my<00:03:07.770> thumb<00:03:08.600> so<00:03:11.120> it's

00:03:12.110 --> 00:03:12.120 
Chaplin roll around my thumb so it's

00:03:12.120 --> 00:03:13.370 
Chaplin roll around my thumb so it's
really<00:03:12.390> just<00:03:12.480> going<00:03:12.720> to<00:03:12.780> be<00:03:12.870> using<00:03:13.260> the

00:03:13.370 --> 00:03:13.380 
really just going to be using the

00:03:13.380 --> 00:03:16.280 
really just going to be using the
momentum<00:03:13.950> of<00:03:14.220> the<00:03:14.490> index<00:03:14.970> roll<00:03:15.240> into<00:03:15.960> the

00:03:16.280 --> 00:03:16.290 
momentum of the index roll into the

00:03:16.290 --> 00:03:18.790 
momentum of the index roll into the
thumb<00:03:16.560> it's<00:03:17.310> one<00:03:17.550> salt<00:03:17.940> thing<00:03:18.270> so<00:03:18.450> you<00:03:18.540> got<00:03:18.750> a

00:03:18.790 --> 00:03:18.800 
thumb it's one salt thing so you got a

00:03:18.800 --> 00:03:21.920 
thumb it's one salt thing so you got a
spare<00:03:19.800> momentum<00:03:20.250> base<00:03:20.400> so<00:03:20.910> you<00:03:20.940> have<00:03:21.270> to<00:03:21.450> use

00:03:21.920 --> 00:03:21.930 
spare momentum base so you have to use

00:03:21.930 --> 00:03:24.620 
spare momentum base so you have to use
the<00:03:22.110> momentum<00:03:22.260> from<00:03:22.710> index<00:03:23.220> roll<00:03:23.460> right<00:03:24.150> into

00:03:24.620 --> 00:03:24.630 
the momentum from index roll right into

00:03:24.630 --> 00:03:25.430 
the momentum from index roll right into
your<00:03:24.810> thumb<00:03:25.050> roll

00:03:25.430 --> 00:03:25.440 
your thumb roll

00:03:25.440 --> 00:03:27.920 
your thumb roll
so<00:03:26.400> once<00:03:26.670> I'm<00:03:26.880> starting<00:03:27.240> to<00:03:27.270> thermal<00:03:27.630> it's

00:03:27.920 --> 00:03:27.930 
so once I'm starting to thermal it's

00:03:27.930 --> 00:03:30.740 
so once I'm starting to thermal it's
going<00:03:28.140> to<00:03:28.200> roll<00:03:28.380> around<00:03:28.940> I'm<00:03:29.940> going<00:03:30.360> to<00:03:30.450> catch

00:03:30.740 --> 00:03:30.750 
going to roll around I'm going to catch

00:03:30.750 --> 00:03:36.800 
going to roll around I'm going to catch
basically<00:03:31.530> right<00:03:31.740> here<00:03:33.260> alright<00:03:34.260> so<00:03:35.420> one<00:03:36.420> two

00:03:36.800 --> 00:03:36.810 
basically right here alright so one two

00:03:36.810 --> 00:03:42.050 
basically right here alright so one two
three<00:03:37.350> roll<00:03:38.270> roll<00:03:39.270> catch<00:03:40.670> alright<00:03:41.670> so<00:03:41.850> here's

00:03:42.050 --> 00:03:42.060 
three roll roll catch alright so here's

00:03:42.060 --> 00:03:45.460 
three roll roll catch alright so here's
everything<00:03:42.240> fast<00:03:42.780> up<00:03:43.020> to<00:03:43.050> that<00:03:43.290> point

00:03:45.460 --> 00:03:45.470 
everything fast up to that point

00:03:45.470 --> 00:03:48.950 
everything fast up to that point
catching<00:03:46.470> right<00:03:46.650> there<00:03:47.150> alright<00:03:48.150> so<00:03:48.450> what<00:03:48.870> I'm

00:03:48.950 --> 00:03:48.960 
catching right there alright so what I'm

00:03:48.960 --> 00:03:53.360 
catching right there alright so what I'm
gonna<00:03:49.080> have<00:03:49.290> to<00:03:49.320> do<00:03:51.530> after<00:03:52.530> this<00:03:52.680> catch<00:03:52.950> is<00:03:53.250> I'm

00:03:53.360 --> 00:03:53.370 
gonna have to do after this catch is I'm

00:03:53.370 --> 00:03:55.699 
gonna have to do after this catch is I'm
going<00:03:53.580> to<00:03:53.700> have<00:03:53.790> to<00:03:53.910> do<00:03:54.030> a<00:03:54.060> thumb<00:03:54.510> roll<00:03:55.380> over

00:03:55.699 --> 00:03:55.709 
going to have to do a thumb roll over

00:03:55.709 --> 00:03:59.270 
going to have to do a thumb roll over
and<00:03:56.840> some<00:03:57.840> tutorials<00:03:58.290> I<00:03:58.410> see<00:03:58.650> they<00:03:58.890> say<00:03:59.220> to

00:03:59.270 --> 00:03:59.280 
and some tutorials I see they say to

00:03:59.280 --> 00:04:01.760 
and some tutorials I see they say to
turn<00:03:59.700> the<00:03:59.970> handles<00:04:00.390> like<00:04:00.540> that<00:04:00.750> so<00:04:01.620> you<00:04:01.680> can

00:04:01.760 --> 00:04:01.770 
turn the handles like that so you can

00:04:01.770 --> 00:04:04.910 
turn the handles like that so you can
kind<00:04:02.130> of<00:04:02.190> turn<00:04:02.400> it<00:04:02.610> and<00:04:02.790> then<00:04:03.140> do<00:04:04.140> those<00:04:04.380> all

00:04:04.910 --> 00:04:04.920 
kind of turn it and then do those all

00:04:04.920 --> 00:04:10.400 
kind of turn it and then do those all
over<00:04:07.760> you<00:04:08.760> can<00:04:08.910> kind<00:04:09.180> of<00:04:09.240> turn<00:04:09.510> it<00:04:09.690> and<00:04:09.870> then

00:04:10.400 --> 00:04:10.410 
over you can kind of turn it and then

00:04:10.410 --> 00:04:12.500 
over you can kind of turn it and then
use<00:04:10.650> it<00:04:10.770> a<00:04:10.920> little<00:04:11.190> but<00:04:11.400> what<00:04:11.459> I<00:04:11.550> do<00:04:11.610> is<00:04:11.940> when<00:04:12.420> I

00:04:12.500 --> 00:04:12.510 
use it a little but what I do is when I

00:04:12.510 --> 00:04:15.680 
use it a little but what I do is when I
catch<00:04:12.750> here<00:04:13.140> I<00:04:13.320> kind<00:04:14.280> of<00:04:14.490> rotate<00:04:15.240> my<00:04:15.390> wrist

00:04:15.680 --> 00:04:15.690 
catch here I kind of rotate my wrist

00:04:15.690 --> 00:04:19.370

it's rotating right so sorry
once<00:04:44.460> again<00:04:44.640> three<00:04:45.330> rolls<00:04:45.750> put<00:04:46.710> my<00:04:46.860> index

00:04:47.210 --> 00:04:47.220 
once again three rolls put my index

00:04:47.220 --> 00:04:49.580 
once again three rolls put my index
finger<00:04:47.550> in<00:04:47.700> comes<00:04:48.570> around<00:04:48.900> put<00:04:49.140> my<00:04:49.260> thumb<00:04:49.560> in

00:04:49.580 --> 00:04:49.590 
finger in comes around put my thumb in

00:04:49.590 --> 00:04:52.659 
finger in comes around put my thumb in
comes<00:04:50.490> around<00:04:50.930> now<00:04:51.930> here<00:04:52.169> you<00:04:52.320> can<00:04:52.440> either

00:04:52.659 --> 00:04:52.669 
comes around now here you can either

00:04:52.669 --> 00:04:56.510 
comes around now here you can either
rotate<00:04:53.669> the<00:04:53.880> handle<00:04:54.740> with<00:04:55.740> your<00:04:55.770> thumb<00:04:56.220> and

and then around and then if you don't

00:05:05.479 --> 00:05:10.749 
and then around and then if you don't
already<00:05:05.689> know<00:05:05.839> the<00:05:06.699> Zen<00:05:07.699> little<00:05:08.059> over<00:05:09.759> then

00:05:10.749 --> 00:05:10.759 
already know the Zen little over then

00:05:10.759 --> 00:05:11.829 
already know the Zen little over then
you<00:05:10.939> should<00:05:11.029> probably<00:05:11.089> learn<00:05:11.479> that<00:05:11.659> move

00:05:11.829 --> 00:05:11.839 
you should probably learn that move

00:05:11.839 --> 00:05:13.480 
you should probably learn that move
because<00:05:12.139> right<00:05:12.439> here<00:05:12.649> the<00:05:12.860> blades<00:05:13.249> coming

00:05:13.480 --> 00:05:13.490 
because right here the blades coming

00:05:13.490 --> 00:05:16.119 
because right here the blades coming
down<00:05:13.699> on<00:05:13.849> you<00:05:13.999> and<00:05:14.209> you<00:05:14.629> have<00:05:14.659> to<00:05:14.869> do<00:05:15.020> a<00:05:15.259> wrist

00:05:16.119 --> 00:05:16.129 
down on you and you have to do a wrist

00:05:16.129 --> 00:05:24.909 
down on you and you have to do a wrist
pass<00:05:16.779> alright<00:05:17.779> so<00:05:21.159> first<00:05:22.159> two<00:05:22.490> rolls<00:05:23.919> then

00:05:24.909 --> 00:05:24.919 
pass alright so first two rolls then

00:05:24.919 --> 00:05:28.389 
pass alright so first two rolls then
here<00:05:25.309> again<00:05:25.610> once<00:05:26.240> again<00:05:26.569> I<00:05:26.779> use<00:05:27.319> my<00:05:27.349> wrist<00:05:27.800> to

00:05:28.389 --> 00:05:28.399 
here again once again I use my wrist to

00:05:28.399 --> 00:05:32.679 
here again once again I use my wrist to
go<00:05:29.149> right<00:05:29.419> into<00:05:29.809> the<00:05:30.610> Zen<00:05:31.610> and<00:05:31.879> then<00:05:32.449> I'm<00:05:32.539> going

00:05:32.679 --> 00:05:32.689 
go right into the Zen and then I'm going

00:05:32.689 --> 00:05:35.909 
go right into the Zen and then I'm going
to<00:05:32.719> do<00:05:32.809> a<00:05:32.839> wrist<00:05:33.139> pass<00:05:33.319> right<00:05:33.559> there<00:05:34.059> um

00:05:35.909 --> 00:05:35.919 
to do a wrist pass right there um

00:05:35.919 --> 00:05:38.199 
to do a wrist pass right there um
basically<00:05:36.919> when<00:05:37.219> I<00:05:37.249> was<00:05:37.459> learning<00:05:37.610> this<00:05:37.909> move

00:05:38.199 --> 00:05:38.209 
basically when I was learning this move

00:05:38.209 --> 00:05:41.499 
basically when I was learning this move
of<00:05:38.509> the<00:05:39.080> index<00:05:39.949> finger<00:05:40.069> roll<00:05:40.580> and<00:05:40.939> then<00:05:41.479> the

00:05:41.499 --> 00:05:41.509 
of the index finger roll and then the

00:05:41.509 --> 00:05:44.889 
of the index finger roll and then the
thumb<00:05:41.930> roll<00:05:42.139> they<00:05:42.619> they<00:05:43.490> want<00:05:43.729> hard<00:05:43.969> I<00:05:44.149> could<00:05:44.419> I

00:05:44.889 --> 00:05:44.899 
thumb roll they they want hard I could I

00:05:44.899 --> 00:05:47.049 
thumb roll they they want hard I could I
could<00:05:45.740> do<00:05:45.889> those<00:05:46.069> pretty<00:05:46.339> smoothly<00:05:46.610> but<00:05:46.969> it

00:05:47.049 --> 00:05:47.059 
could do those pretty smoothly but it

00:05:47.059 --> 00:05:48.820 
could do those pretty smoothly but it
was<00:05:47.180> once<00:05:47.330> I<00:05:47.449> caught<00:05:47.659> right<00:05:47.869> here<00:05:47.899> I<00:05:48.289> couldn't

00:05:48.820 --> 00:05:48.830 
was once I caught right here I couldn't

00:05:48.830 --> 00:05:51.369 
was once I caught right here I couldn't
really<00:05:48.949> figure<00:05:49.189> out<00:05:49.339> how<00:05:49.699> to<00:05:50.050> see<00:05:51.050> I'm<00:05:51.199> not

00:05:51.369 --> 00:05:51.379 
really figure out how to see I'm not

00:05:51.379 --> 00:05:52.929 
really figure out how to see I'm not
capturing<00:05:51.919> right<00:05:52.099> here<00:05:52.339> where<00:05:52.610> I<00:05:52.639> can<00:05:52.699> go

00:05:52.929 --> 00:05:52.939 
capturing right here where I can go

00:05:52.939 --> 00:05:54.159 
capturing right here where I can go
right<00:05:53.119> into<00:05:53.330> it<00:05:53.539> so<00:05:53.569> I'm<00:05:53.749> all<00:05:53.899> over<00:05:53.990> I'm

00:05:54.159 --> 00:05:54.169 
right into it so I'm all over I'm

00:05:54.169 --> 00:05:56.589 
right into it so I'm all over I'm
catching<00:05:54.559> that<00:05:54.740> here<00:05:54.949> so<00:05:55.729> you<00:05:55.819> kind<00:05:56.240> of<00:05:56.360> have

00:05:56.589 --> 00:05:56.599 
catching that here so you kind of have

00:05:56.599 --> 00:05:58.809 
catching that here so you kind of have
to<00:05:56.749> either<00:05:57.080> rotate<00:05:57.589> the<00:05:57.740> handles<00:05:58.099> like<00:05:58.399> I<00:05:58.550> said

00:05:58.809 --> 00:05:58.819 
to either rotate the handles like I said

00:05:58.819 --> 00:06:02.290 
to either rotate the handles like I said
or<00:05:59.269> you<00:06:00.159> re<00:06:01.159> grip<00:06:01.429> a<00:06:01.459> little<00:06:01.759> bit<00:06:01.909> and<00:06:02.119> then<00:06:02.240> you

00:06:02.290 --> 00:06:02.300 
or you re grip a little bit and then you

00:06:02.300 --> 00:06:07.570 
or you re grip a little bit and then you
come<00:06:02.479> around<00:06:03.759> um<00:06:05.139> I<00:06:06.139> just<00:06:06.949> kept<00:06:07.369> practicing

00:06:07.570 --> 00:06:07.580 
come around um I just kept practicing

00:06:07.580 --> 00:06:10.359 
come around um I just kept practicing
and<00:06:08.209> eventually<00:06:08.599> it<00:06:08.899> clicked<00:06:09.379> and<00:06:09.619> I<00:06:10.099> kind<00:06:10.309> of

00:06:10.359 --> 00:06:10.369 
and eventually it clicked and I kind of

00:06:10.369 --> 00:06:12.549 
and eventually it clicked and I kind of
figured<00:06:10.519> out<00:06:10.819> how<00:06:10.999> to<00:06:11.029> do<00:06:11.300> it<00:06:11.449> how<00:06:11.779> I<00:06:11.809> rotate<00:06:12.529> my

00:06:12.549 --> 00:06:12.559 
figured out how to do it how I rotate my

00:06:12.559 --> 00:06:15.459 
figured out how to do it how I rotate my
wrist<00:06:12.939> or<00:06:13.939> you<00:06:14.449> can<00:06:14.629> rotate<00:06:14.779> the<00:06:15.080> handle<00:06:15.349> like

00:06:15.459 --> 00:06:15.469 
wrist or you can rotate the handle like

00:06:15.469 --> 00:06:17.439 
wrist or you can rotate the handle like
that<00:06:15.709> it<00:06:16.249> doesn't<00:06:16.519> look<00:06:16.580> as<00:06:16.759> smooth<00:06:17.029> that<00:06:17.269> way

00:06:17.439 --> 00:06:17.449 
that it doesn't look as smooth that way

00:06:17.449 --> 00:06:20.649 
that it doesn't look as smooth that way
um<00:06:18.349> so<00:06:19.009> you<00:06:19.399> just<00:06:19.550> kind<00:06:19.729> of<00:06:19.789> keep<00:06:20.029> practicing

00:06:20.649 --> 00:06:20.659 
um so you just kind of keep practicing

00:06:20.659 --> 00:06:22.119 
um so you just kind of keep practicing
and<00:06:20.869> eventually<00:06:21.319> you<00:06:21.499> should<00:06:21.529> be<00:06:21.829> able<00:06:21.889> to<00:06:21.979> get

00:06:22.119 --> 00:06:22.129 
and eventually you should be able to get

00:06:22.129 --> 00:06:26.519 
and eventually you should be able to get
this<00:06:22.249> move<00:06:22.490> it's<00:06:23.419> not<00:06:23.659> too<00:06:23.869> hard<00:06:24.199> to<00:06:24.229> move<00:06:25.419> I

00:06:26.519 --> 00:06:26.529 
this move it's not too hard to move I

00:06:26.529 --> 00:06:30.219 
this move it's not too hard to move I
hope<00:06:27.529> to<00:06:27.680> see<00:06:27.860> it<00:06:27.979> in<00:06:28.099> your<00:06:28.219> combos<00:06:28.669> and<00:06:29.229> just

00:06:30.219 --> 00:06:30.229 
hope to see it in your combos and just

00:06:30.229 --> 00:06:35.709 
hope to see it in your combos and just
move<00:06:30.439> one<00:06:30.559> more<00:06:30.709> time<00:06:34.240> I'll<00:06:35.240> give<00:06:35.419> it<00:06:35.509> to<00:06:35.539> you

00:06:35.709 --> 00:06:35.719 
move one more time I'll give it to you

00:06:35.719 --> 00:06:39.850 
move one more time I'll give it to you
on<00:06:36.019> motion<00:06:36.379> right<00:06:36.499> now<00:06:36.559> so<00:06:37.490> you<00:06:37.550> can<00:06:38.619> study<00:06:39.619> it

00:06:39.850 --> 00:06:39.860 
on motion right now so you can study it

00:06:39.860 --> 00:06:42.159 
on motion right now so you can study it
and<00:06:40.069> get<00:06:40.789> whatever<00:06:40.939> you<00:06:41.149> need<00:06:41.479> to<00:06:41.509> out<00:06:41.990> of<00:06:42.079> the

00:06:42.159 --> 00:06:42.169 
and get whatever you need to out of the

00:06:42.169 --> 00:06:43.600 
and get whatever you need to out of the
move<00:06:42.319> that<00:06:42.529> you<00:06:42.589> haven't<00:06:43.009> got<00:06:43.129> from<00:06:43.430> the

00:06:43.600 --> 00:06:43.610 
move that you haven't got from the

00:06:43.610 --> 00:06:52.490 
move that you haven't got from the
instructions<00:06:44.149> there<00:06:44.779> you<00:06:44.869> go

00:06:52.490 --> 00:06:52.500 

00:06:52.500 --> 00:06:54.560 

you
