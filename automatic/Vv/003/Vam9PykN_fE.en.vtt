00:00:34.139 --> 00:00:34.149 
the full adjustable öhlins suspension

00:00:34.149 --> 00:00:37.899 
the full adjustable öhlins suspension
front<00:00:35.149> and<00:00:35.360> back<00:00:36.219> I've<00:00:37.219> set<00:00:37.519> this<00:00:37.640> back<00:00:37.879> to

00:00:37.899 --> 00:00:37.909 
front and back I've set this back to

00:00:37.909 --> 00:00:39.819 
front and back I've set this back to
stock<00:00:38.300> settings<00:00:38.690> it<00:00:38.780> was<00:00:38.899> pretty<00:00:39.109> hard<00:00:39.440> setup

00:00:39.819 --> 00:00:39.829 
stock settings it was pretty hard setup

00:00:39.829 --> 00:00:41.619 
stock settings it was pretty hard setup
so<00:00:39.949> it<00:00:40.039> was<00:00:40.129> a<00:00:40.159> hard<00:00:40.339> ride<00:00:40.670> but<00:00:41.239> it's

00:00:41.619 --> 00:00:41.629 
so it was a hard ride but it's

00:00:41.629 --> 00:00:44.529 
so it was a hard ride but it's
surprisingly<00:00:42.530> comfortable<00:00:43.030> so<00:00:44.030> in<00:00:44.179> here<00:00:44.359> we

00:00:44.529 --> 00:00:44.539 
surprisingly comfortable so in here we

00:00:44.539 --> 00:00:46.660 
surprisingly comfortable so in here we
have<00:00:44.569> the<00:00:44.749> GPX<00:00:45.649> Aust<00:00:45.920> the<00:00:46.249> quick<00:00:46.460> shifter

00:00:46.660 --> 00:00:46.670 
have the GPX Aust the quick shifter

00:00:46.670 --> 00:00:48.160 
have the GPX Aust the quick shifter
which<00:00:47.089> means<00:00:47.329> that<00:00:47.449> you<00:00:47.510> do<00:00:47.690> not<00:00:47.719> have<00:00:48.050> to

00:00:48.160 --> 00:00:48.170 
which means that you do not have to

00:00:48.170 --> 00:00:50.079 
which means that you do not have to
close<00:00:48.409> the<00:00:48.559> throttle<00:00:48.920> when<00:00:49.760> you're<00:00:49.940> up

00:00:50.079 --> 00:00:50.089 
close the throttle when you're up

00:00:50.089 --> 00:00:52.299 
close the throttle when you're up
shifting<00:00:50.539> and<00:00:50.749> it<00:00:51.050> makes<00:00:51.289> you<00:00:51.469> way<00:00:51.769> too<00:00:51.829> fast

00:00:52.299 --> 00:00:52.309 
shifting and it makes you way too fast

00:00:52.309 --> 00:00:55.389
