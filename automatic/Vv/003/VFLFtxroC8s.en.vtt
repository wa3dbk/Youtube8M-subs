00:00:40.340 --> 00:00:40.350 
of the season I thought we really

00:00:40.350 --> 00:00:42.830 
of the season I thought we really
struggled<00:00:40.770> at<00:00:40.860> the<00:00:40.890> beginning<00:00:41.430> a<00:00:41.969> lot<00:00:42.600> of<00:00:42.660> that

00:00:50.119 --> 00:00:50.129 
exhibition games and it's first being an

00:00:50.129 --> 00:00:53.600 
exhibition games and it's first being an
older<00:00:50.430> team<00:00:51.590> you<00:00:52.590> know<00:00:52.739> it<00:00:53.250> just<00:00:53.370> took<00:00:53.550> a

00:00:53.600 --> 00:00:53.610 
older team you know it just took a

00:00:53.610 --> 00:00:55.130

00:00:55.130 --> 00:00:55.140 
little while to get out the gates but I

00:00:55.140 --> 00:00:57.439 
little while to get out the gates but I
thought<00:00:55.379> you<00:00:55.739> know<00:00:55.890> once<00:00:56.129> we<00:00:56.340> got<00:00:57.180> through<00:00:57.360> the

00:00:57.439 --> 00:00:57.449 
thought you know once we got through the

00:00:57.449 --> 00:01:00.200 
thought you know once we got through the
first<00:00:57.480> half<00:00:57.809> of<00:00:58.020> the<00:00:58.079> season<00:00:58.320> we<00:00:59.210> refocused

00:01:00.200 --> 00:01:00.210 
first half of the season we refocused

00:01:00.210 --> 00:01:01.939 
first half of the season we refocused
for<00:01:00.690> the<00:01:00.750> second<00:01:01.079> half<00:01:01.170> of<00:01:01.260> the<00:01:01.350> season<00:01:01.559> and<00:01:01.800> we

00:01:01.939 --> 00:01:01.949 
for the second half of the season and we

00:01:01.949 --> 00:01:03.439 
for the second half of the season and we
made<00:01:02.100> a<00:01:02.129> great<00:01:02.250> run<00:01:02.640> you<00:01:02.940> know<00:01:03.149> I<00:01:03.180> really

00:01:03.439 --> 00:01:03.449 
made a great run you know I really

00:01:03.449 --> 00:01:05.210 
made a great run you know I really
thought<00:01:03.600> we<00:01:03.780> had<00:01:03.899> an<00:01:03.989> opportunity<00:01:04.589> to<00:01:05.070> play

00:01:05.210 --> 00:01:05.220

for<00:01:05.430> another<00:01:05.489> Championships<00:01:06.330> I<00:01:06.540> thought

00:01:06.740 --> 00:01:06.750 
for another Championships I thought

00:01:06.750 --> 00:01:09.350 
for another Championships I thought

00:01:10.910 --> 00:01:10.920 
and throughout the year I thought you

00:01:10.920 --> 00:01:13.039 
and throughout the year I thought you
know<00:01:11.040> we've<00:01:11.189> overcome<00:01:11.970> the<00:01:12.119> injury<00:01:12.390> bug<00:01:12.570> you

00:01:13.039 --> 00:01:13.049

to Jeff Green to Avery - Jermaine O'Neal
it<00:01:20.670> was<00:01:20.790> just<00:01:20.970> so<00:01:21.150> much<00:01:21.299> we<00:01:21.479> had<00:01:21.600> to<00:01:21.630> overcome

00:01:22.010 --> 00:01:22.020 
it was just so much we had to overcome

00:01:22.020 --> 00:01:25.070 
it was just so much we had to overcome
to<00:01:22.799> get<00:01:23.159> to<00:01:23.310> the<00:01:23.400> point<00:01:23.610> where<00:01:24.119> we<00:01:24.270> were<00:01:24.570> at<00:01:24.780> one

00:01:25.070 --> 00:01:25.080

00:01:28.130 --> 00:01:28.140 
game away it's really tough so hopefully

00:01:28.140 --> 00:01:30.080 
game away it's really tough so hopefully
you<00:01:28.380> know<00:01:28.530> coming<00:01:29.250> into<00:01:29.430> the<00:01:29.579> next<00:01:29.700> season<00:01:30.030> we

00:01:30.080 --> 00:01:30.090 
you know coming into the next season we

00:01:30.090 --> 00:01:30.679 
you know coming into the next season we
can<00:01:30.240> stay<00:01:30.360> healthy

00:01:30.679 --> 00:01:30.689 
can stay healthy

00:01:30.689 --> 00:01:36.289 
can stay healthy
speaking<00:01:31.560> of<00:01:31.650> injuries<00:01:32.009> you<00:01:32.220> played<00:01:35.150> the<00:01:36.150> knee

00:01:36.289 --> 00:01:36.299 
speaking of injuries you played the knee

00:01:36.299 --> 00:01:38.990 
speaking of injuries you played the knee
is<00:01:36.420> a<00:01:36.450> lot<00:01:36.689> better<00:01:36.979> it's<00:01:37.979> not<00:01:38.340> completely

00:01:38.990 --> 00:01:39.000 
is a lot better it's not completely

00:01:39.000 --> 00:01:40.969 
is a lot better it's not completely
healed<00:01:39.360> but<00:01:39.630> I<00:01:39.659> think<00:01:40.320> I<00:01:40.409> figure<00:01:40.680> I'm<00:01:40.770> about

00:01:40.969 --> 00:01:40.979 
healed but I think I figure I'm about

00:01:40.979 --> 00:01:43.160 
healed but I think I figure I'm about
90%<00:01:41.280> now<00:01:42.150> so<00:01:42.540> I've<00:01:42.630> been<00:01:42.750> doing<00:01:42.930> a<00:01:42.990> lot<00:01:43.110> of

00:01:43.160 --> 00:01:43.170 
90% now so I've been doing a lot of

00:01:43.170 --> 00:01:45.889 
90% now so I've been doing a lot of
things<00:01:43.409> to<00:01:43.619> strengthen<00:01:43.799> it<00:01:44.540> so<00:01:45.540> I<00:01:45.600> could<00:01:45.750> come

00:01:45.889 --> 00:01:45.899 
things to strengthen it so I could come

00:01:45.899 --> 00:01:47.840 
things to strengthen it so I could come
back<00:01:45.930> a<00:01:46.049> stronger<00:01:46.530> player<00:01:46.770> I<00:01:47.100> really<00:01:47.549> have

00:05:48.750 --> 00:05:48.760 
year I thought I think we're more

year I thought I think we're more
talented<00:05:49.300> we're<00:05:49.990> able<00:05:50.080> to<00:05:50.229> bring<00:05:50.410> back

00:05:50.430 --> 00:05:50.440 
talented we're able to bring back

00:05:50.440 --> 00:05:51.900 
talented we're able to bring back
Brandon<00:05:50.950> bass<00:05:51.250> we<00:05:51.400> brought<00:05:51.580> back<00:05:51.700> our

00:05:51.900 --> 00:05:51.910 
Brandon bass we brought back our

00:05:51.910 --> 00:05:54.000 
Brandon bass we brought back our
starters<00:05:52.330> and<00:05:52.540> then<00:05:52.870> add<00:05:53.080> it<00:05:53.260> to<00:05:53.290> it<00:05:53.560> then<00:05:53.830> I

00:05:54.000 --> 00:05:54.010 
starters and then add it to it then I

00:05:54.010 --> 00:05:55.409 
starters and then add it to it then I
think<00:05:54.220> we<00:05:54.370> have<00:05:54.490> a<00:05:54.520> deeper<00:05:54.880> and<00:05:55.030> better<00:05:55.120> bench

00:05:55.409 --> 00:05:55.419 
think we have a deeper and better bench

00:05:55.419 --> 00:05:58.140 
think we have a deeper and better bench
and<00:05:55.720> hopefully<00:05:56.140> it<00:05:57.039> reflects<00:05:57.430> that<00:05:57.550> in<00:05:58.030> the

00:05:58.140 --> 00:05:58.150 
and hopefully it reflects that in the

00:05:58.150 --> 00:05:59.490 
and hopefully it reflects that in the
playoffs<00:05:58.539> so<00:05:58.690> we<00:05:58.840> can<00:05:58.960> go<00:05:59.050> to<00:05:59.229> a<00:05:59.260> championship

00:05:59.490 --> 00:05:59.500 
playoffs so we can go to a championship

00:05:59.500 --> 00:06:01.740 
playoffs so we can go to a championship
