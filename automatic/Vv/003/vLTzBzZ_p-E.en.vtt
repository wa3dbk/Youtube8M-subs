partly ambassador but no I'd see it

00:00:30.000 --> 00:00:31.429

probably<00:00:30.330> is<00:00:30.420> the<00:00:30.539> largest<00:00:30.839> it's<00:00:31.109> definitely

00:00:31.429 --> 00:00:31.439 
probably is the largest it's definitely

00:00:31.439 --> 00:00:33.590 
probably is the largest it's definitely
largest<00:00:31.830> I've<00:00:31.920> experienced<00:00:32.430> so<00:00:32.610> far<00:00:32.640> because

00:00:33.590 --> 00:00:33.600 
largest I've experienced so far because

00:00:33.600 --> 00:00:35.990 
largest I've experienced so far because
it<00:00:34.380> doesn't<00:00:34.740> sound<00:00:34.890> large<00:00:35.220> at<00:00:35.400> first<00:00:35.640> you<00:00:35.850> get

00:00:35.990 --> 00:00:36.000 
it doesn't sound large at first you get

00:00:36.000 --> 00:00:38.180 
it doesn't sound large at first you get
six<00:00:36.360> levels<00:00:36.720> for<00:00:36.930> north<00:00:37.140> south<00:00:37.530> east<00:00:37.830> and<00:00:38.160> west

00:00:38.180 --> 00:00:38.190 
six levels for north south east and west

00:00:38.190 --> 00:00:40.790

except you get an extra one in East I

00:00:40.800 --> 00:00:42.290

think<00:00:41.010> it<00:00:41.130> is<00:00:41.250> it's<00:00:41.430> either<00:00:41.520> east<00:00:41.820> or<00:00:41.970> west<00:00:42.030> you

00:00:42.290 --> 00:00:42.300 
think it is it's either east or west you

completely<00:01:44.100> wrong<00:01:44.899> purely<00:01:45.899> because<00:01:46.049> of<00:01:46.200> that

00:01:46.340 --> 00:01:46.350 
completely wrong purely because of that

00:01:46.350 --> 00:01:48.139 
completely wrong purely because of that
because<00:01:46.560> people<00:01:47.249> were<00:01:47.310> saying<00:01:47.490> that<00:01:47.939> you'd

00:01:48.139 --> 00:01:48.149 
because people were saying that you'd

00:01:48.149 --> 00:01:49.700 
because people were saying that you'd
have<00:01:48.329> to<00:01:48.450> go<00:01:48.569> here<00:01:48.749> there<00:01:49.049> than<00:01:49.259> there<00:01:49.469> and<00:01:49.619> I'm

00:01:49.700 --> 00:01:49.710 
have to go here there than there and I'm

00:01:49.710 --> 00:01:50.899 
have to go here there than there and I'm
just<00:01:49.740> saying<00:01:50.069> well<00:01:50.249> I<00:01:50.280> just<00:01:50.369> do<00:01:50.639> them<00:01:50.759> in

00:01:50.899 --> 00:01:50.909 
just saying well I just do them in

00:01:50.909 --> 00:01:52.849 
just saying well I just do them in
number<00:01:51.179> order<00:01:51.359> and<00:01:51.899> apparently<00:01:52.439> you're<00:01:52.829> not

00:01:52.849 --> 00:01:52.859 
number order and apparently you're not

00:01:52.859 --> 00:01:53.989 
number order and apparently you're not
really<00:01:53.159> supposed<00:01:53.460> to<00:01:53.609> do<00:01:53.700> them<00:01:53.819> in<00:01:53.909> number

00:01:53.989 --> 00:01:53.999 
really supposed to do them in number

00:01:53.999 --> 00:01:56.989 
really supposed to do them in number
order<00:01:54.590> so<00:01:55.590> that<00:01:55.829> was<00:01:56.130> me<00:01:56.369> pretty<00:01:56.579> much<00:01:56.759> taught

00:01:56.989 --> 00:01:56.999 
order so that was me pretty much taught

00:01:56.999 --> 00:01:58.669 
order so that was me pretty much taught

00:02:23.179 --> 00:02:23.189 
but I think it's a deal with a golf game

00:02:23.189 --> 00:02:27.110 
but I think it's a deal with a golf game
to<00:02:24.189> do<00:02:24.459> yes<00:02:24.909> getting<00:02:25.659> ear<00:02:26.109> coins<00:02:26.500> in<00:02:26.709> the<00:02:26.799> stage

to do yes getting ear coins in the stage

00:02:27.120 --> 00:02:31.289 
to do yes getting ear coins in the stage
gets<00:02:28.120> a<00:02:28.469> tile<00:02:29.469> and<00:02:29.829> as<00:02:30.579> you<00:02:30.700> go<00:02:30.849> through<00:02:30.879> you'll

00:02:31.289 --> 00:02:31.299 
gets a tile and as you go through you'll

gets a tile and as you go through you'll
notice<00:02:31.599> at<00:02:31.719> the<00:02:31.780> tower's<00:02:32.019> of<00:02:32.260> building<00:02:32.620> a<00:02:32.680> golf

00:03:29.099 --> 00:03:29.109

as<00:03:29.199> many<00:03:29.379> times<00:03:29.590> but<00:03:29.949> because<00:03:30.220> I<00:03:30.310> am<00:03:30.340> I<00:03:30.760> keep

web<00:03:35.260> and<00:03:35.470> then<00:03:35.560> I<00:03:35.590> have<00:03:35.739> to<00:03:35.859> run<00:03:36.010> there<00:03:36.250> and<00:03:36.519> now

00:03:36.599 --> 00:03:36.609 
web and then I have to run there and now

00:03:36.609 --> 00:03:38.819 
web and then I have to run there and now
I'm<00:03:36.729> set<00:03:36.909> on<00:03:37.000> fire<00:03:37.209> again<00:03:37.540> and<00:03:37.569> it<00:03:38.260> can<00:03:38.590> turn

00:03:38.819 --> 00:03:38.829 
I'm set on fire again and it can turn

00:03:38.829 --> 00:03:40.500 
I'm set on fire again and it can turn

00:03:40.500 --> 00:03:40.510 
into an endless nightmare if you really

00:03:40.510 --> 00:03:42.420 
into an endless nightmare if you really
don't<00:03:40.690> have<00:03:40.780> any<00:03:40.959> patience<00:03:41.409> so<00:03:42.010> that<00:03:42.400> I

00:03:42.420 --> 00:03:42.430 
don't have any patience so that I

00:03:42.430 --> 00:03:43.770 
don't have any patience so that I
suppose<00:03:42.849> that's<00:03:43.060> one<00:03:43.209> of<00:03:43.299> the<00:03:43.359> things<00:03:43.629> I

00:03:43.770 --> 00:03:43.780 
suppose that's one of the things I

00:03:43.780 --> 00:03:45.869 
suppose that's one of the things I
should<00:03:44.440> see<00:03:44.650> about<00:03:44.859> the<00:03:44.979> game<00:03:45.159> it's<00:03:45.430> much<00:03:45.609> like

00:03:45.869 --> 00:03:45.879 
should see about the game it's much like

00:03:45.879 --> 00:03:49.020 
should see about the game it's much like
a<00:03:45.909> Mega<00:03:46.180> Man<00:03:46.269> game<00:03:46.419> in<00:03:46.870> terms<00:03:47.560> almost<00:03:48.159> where<00:03:48.729> if

00:03:49.020 --> 00:03:49.030 
a Mega Man game in terms almost where if

00:03:49.030 --> 00:03:51.659 
a Mega Man game in terms almost where if
you're<00:03:49.870> patient<00:03:50.169> then<00:03:50.769> you'll<00:03:50.949> be<00:03:51.099> fine

00:03:51.659 --> 00:03:51.669 
you're patient then you'll be fine

00:03:51.669 --> 00:03:53.369 
you're patient then you'll be fine
if<00:03:51.729> you're<00:03:52.030> not<00:03:52.389> then<00:03:52.750> you're<00:03:52.930> probably<00:03:53.169> going

00:03:53.369 --> 00:03:53.379 
if you're not then you're probably going

00:03:53.379 --> 00:03:56.250 
if you're not then you're probably going
to<00:03:53.470> get<00:03:53.530> very<00:03:53.799> angry<00:03:54.040> at<00:03:54.310> some<00:03:54.489> point<00:03:55.260> but

00:03:56.250 --> 00:03:56.260 
to get very angry at some point but

00:03:56.260 --> 00:03:59.309 
to get very angry at some point but
gameplay<00:03:56.739> wise<00:03:57.120> there<00:03:58.120> is<00:03:58.269> an<00:03:58.510> awful<00:03:59.019> lot<00:03:59.169> to

00:03:59.309 --> 00:03:59.319 
gameplay wise there is an awful lot to

00:03:59.319 --> 00:04:01.289 
gameplay wise there is an awful lot to
do<00:03:59.500> as<00:04:00.189> I<00:04:00.310> said<00:04:00.459> it<00:04:00.579> is<00:04:00.729> probably<00:04:01.060> one<00:04:01.180> of<00:04:01.209> the

00:04:01.289 --> 00:04:01.299 
do as I said it is probably one of the

00:04:01.299 --> 00:04:03.149 
do as I said it is probably one of the
largest<00:04:01.629> warrior<00:04:02.260> games<00:04:02.530> and<00:04:02.799> one<00:04:03.010> of<00:04:03.099> the

00:04:03.149 --> 00:04:03.159 
largest warrior games and one of the

00:04:03.159 --> 00:04:06.030 
largest warrior games and one of the

largest VC games available for the 3d s

just wanting to get in or what I still
see<00:04:10.599> a<00:04:10.629> start<00:04:10.959> with<00:04:11.079> one<00:04:11.319> first<00:04:11.680> because<00:04:11.949> I

00:04:12.210 --> 00:04:12.220 
see a start with one first because I

00:04:12.220 --> 00:04:13.740 
see a start with one first because I
think<00:04:12.430> it<00:04:12.549> is<00:04:12.669> the<00:04:12.909> best<00:04:13.060> of<00:04:13.299> the<00:04:13.449> warrior

00:04:13.740 --> 00:04:13.750 
think it is the best of the warrior

00:04:13.750 --> 00:04:16.589 
think it is the best of the warrior
games<00:04:13.959> I<00:04:14.259> really<00:04:14.590> do<00:04:14.790> it's<00:04:15.790> like<00:04:16.060> my<00:04:16.209> absolute

00:04:16.589 --> 00:04:16.599 
games I really do it's like my absolute

00:04:16.599 --> 00:04:18.960 
games I really do it's like my absolute
favorite<00:04:17.109> of<00:04:17.320> all<00:04:17.590> the<00:04:17.769> warrior<00:04:18.039> games<00:04:18.250> but

00:04:18.960 --> 00:04:18.970 
favorite of all the warrior games but

00:04:18.970 --> 00:04:21.719 
favorite of all the warrior games but
after<00:04:19.509> that<00:04:19.690> you<00:04:20.620> might<00:04:20.769> want<00:04:20.949> to<00:04:21.009> skip<00:04:21.159> to<00:04:21.489> and

00:04:21.719 --> 00:04:21.729 
after that you might want to skip to and

00:04:21.729 --> 00:04:23.070 
after that you might want to skip to and

00:04:23.070 --> 00:04:23.080 
move on to this one because I was never

00:04:23.080 --> 00:04:25.290 
move on to this one because I was never
really<00:04:23.320> a<00:04:23.440> huge<00:04:23.800> fan<00:04:24.070> of<00:04:24.099> -<00:04:24.430> but<00:04:24.729> I<00:04:24.759> quite<00:04:25.090> like

this one well that's pretty much all I

00:04:28.870 --> 00:04:30.510 
this one well that's pretty much all I
can<00:04:29.020> see<00:04:29.169> I<00:04:29.200> mean<00:04:29.409> graphically<00:04:29.979> as<00:04:30.250> you<00:04:30.400> can

can see I mean graphically as you can
probably

00:04:30.940 --> 00:04:30.950 
probably

00:04:30.950 --> 00:04:33.460 
probably
yourself<00:04:31.340> it<00:04:31.520> looks<00:04:31.550> quite<00:04:31.970> good<00:04:32.140> I'm<00:04:33.140> quite

00:04:33.460 --> 00:04:33.470 
yourself it looks quite good I'm quite

00:04:33.470 --> 00:04:34.540 
yourself it looks quite good I'm quite
impressed<00:04:33.800> with<00:04:33.920> what<00:04:34.160> they<00:04:34.250> were<00:04:34.340> able<00:04:34.520> to

00:04:34.540 --> 00:04:34.550 
impressed with what they were able to

00:04:34.550 --> 00:04:36.580 
impressed with what they were able to
deal<00:04:34.730> with<00:04:34.880> again<00:04:35.060> boy<00:04:35.240> call<00:04:35.450> again<00:04:35.750> it's<00:04:36.410> just

00:04:36.580 --> 00:04:36.590 
deal with again boy call again it's just

00:04:36.590 --> 00:04:38.980 
deal with again boy call again it's just
not<00:04:37.280> a<00:04:37.310> huge<00:04:37.790> improvement<00:04:38.150> on<00:04:38.540> the<00:04:38.660> likes<00:04:38.840> of

00:04:38.980 --> 00:04:38.990 
not a huge improvement on the likes of

00:04:38.990 --> 00:04:40.780 
not a huge improvement on the likes of
where<00:04:39.200> we<00:04:39.290> all<00:04:39.350> on<00:04:39.560> to<00:04:39.800> but<00:04:40.160> I<00:04:40.190> think<00:04:40.610> there

00:04:40.780 --> 00:04:40.790 
where we all on to but I think there

00:04:40.790 --> 00:04:43.720 
where we all on to but I think there
wasn't<00:04:40.940> slight<00:04:41.930> noticeable<00:04:42.550> improvement<00:04:43.550> and

00:04:43.720 --> 00:04:43.730 
wasn't slight noticeable improvement and

00:04:43.730 --> 00:04:46.240 
wasn't slight noticeable improvement and
musically<00:04:44.690> arvore<00:04:45.260> was<00:04:45.440> like<00:04:45.620> -<00:04:45.860> how<00:04:45.980> were

00:04:46.240 --> 00:04:46.250 
musically arvore was like - how were

00:04:46.250 --> 00:04:49.450 
musically arvore was like - how were
your<00:04:46.460> conduct<00:04:46.940> sees<00:04:47.150> music<00:04:48.160> that<00:04:49.160> I've<00:04:49.250> always

00:04:49.450 --> 00:04:49.460 
your conduct sees music that I've always

00:04:49.460 --> 00:04:50.860 
your conduct sees music that I've always
thought<00:04:49.670> the<00:04:49.820> warrior<00:04:50.090> games<00:04:50.300> sounded<00:04:50.750> quite

00:04:50.860 --> 00:04:50.870 
thought the warrior games sounded quite

00:04:50.870 --> 00:04:54.040 
thought the warrior games sounded quite
nice<00:04:51.200> and<00:04:51.530> quite<00:04:52.430> strange<00:04:53.360> at<00:04:53.510> the<00:04:53.600> same<00:04:53.720> time

00:04:54.040 --> 00:04:54.050 
nice and quite strange at the same time

00:04:54.050 --> 00:04:56.470 
nice and quite strange at the same time
that<00:04:54.320> the<00:04:54.500> definitely<00:04:55.460> sound<00:04:55.790> different<00:04:56.450> to

00:04:56.470 --> 00:04:56.480 
that the definitely sound different to

00:04:56.480 --> 00:04:58.900 
that the definitely sound different to
Mario<00:04:56.960> and<00:04:57.020> that<00:04:57.440> is<00:04:57.680> something<00:04:58.400> in<00:04:58.610> its<00:04:58.760> own

00:04:58.900 --> 00:04:58.910 
Mario and that is something in its own

00:04:58.910 --> 00:05:00.820 
Mario and that is something in its own
because<00:04:59.300> usually<00:04:59.510> when<00:04:59.930> as<00:05:00.140> soon<00:05:00.380> as<00:05:00.560> you<00:05:00.650> put

00:05:00.820 --> 00:05:00.830 
because usually when as soon as you put

00:05:00.830 --> 00:05:03.010 
because usually when as soon as you put
a<00:05:00.860> Mario<00:05:01.190> game<00:05:01.220> on<00:05:01.640> even<00:05:02.360> if<00:05:02.450> it's<00:05:02.600> new<00:05:02.780> music

00:05:03.010 --> 00:05:03.020 
a Mario game on even if it's new music

00:05:03.020 --> 00:05:04.870 
a Mario game on even if it's new music
you<00:05:03.410> can<00:05:03.560> instantly<00:05:03.950> think<00:05:04.280> yeah<00:05:04.550> this<00:05:04.760> is

00:05:04.870 --> 00:05:04.880 
you can instantly think yeah this is

00:05:04.880 --> 00:05:07.000 
you can instantly think yeah this is
Mario<00:05:05.180> and<00:05:05.600> I<00:05:05.720> think<00:05:05.930> warriors<00:05:06.320> got<00:05:06.560> that<00:05:06.710> cm

00:05:07.000 --> 00:05:07.010 
Mario and I think warriors got that cm

00:05:07.010 --> 00:05:09.430 
Mario and I think warriors got that cm
effect<00:05:07.310> with<00:05:07.520> me<00:05:07.640> and<00:05:07.940> I<00:05:08.390> think<00:05:08.450> his<00:05:08.870> music<00:05:09.110> is

00:05:09.430 --> 00:05:09.440 
effect with me and I think his music is

00:05:09.440 --> 00:05:11.790 
effect with me and I think his music is
instantly<00:05:10.280> recognizable<00:05:10.490> as<00:05:11.210> a<00:05:11.240> warrior<00:05:11.450> game

00:05:11.790 --> 00:05:11.800 
instantly recognizable as a warrior game

00:05:11.800 --> 00:05:13.990 
instantly recognizable as a warrior game
so<00:05:12.800> that's<00:05:13.190> pretty<00:05:13.400> much<00:05:13.490> all<00:05:13.670> I<00:05:13.730> can<00:05:13.910> say

00:05:13.990 --> 00:05:14.000 
so that's pretty much all I can say

00:05:14.000 --> 00:05:16.840 
so that's pretty much all I can say
about<00:05:14.030> Thor<00:05:14.570> um<00:05:14.950> just<00:05:15.950> as<00:05:16.220> a<00:05:16.250> sailin

00:05:16.840 --> 00:05:16.850 
about Thor um just as a sailin

00:05:16.850 --> 00:05:18.460 
about Thor um just as a sailin
if<00:05:16.910> you're<00:05:17.510> just<00:05:17.690> wanting<00:05:17.900> to<00:05:17.960> get<00:05:18.080> in<00:05:18.230> a<00:05:18.320> limb

00:05:18.460 --> 00:05:18.470 
if you're just wanting to get in a limb

00:05:18.470 --> 00:05:21.640 
if you're just wanting to get in a limb
stick<00:05:18.800> with<00:05:18.950> one<00:05:19.160> if<00:05:19.430> you<00:05:20.360> do<00:05:20.930> like<00:05:21.230> the<00:05:21.440> looks

00:05:21.640 --> 00:05:21.650 
stick with one if you do like the looks

00:05:21.650 --> 00:05:23.380 
stick with one if you do like the looks
of<00:05:21.770> anything<00:05:22.310> then<00:05:22.490> probably<00:05:22.880> start<00:05:23.240> with

00:05:23.380 --> 00:05:23.390 
of anything then probably start with

00:05:23.390 --> 00:05:28.330 
of anything then probably start with
this<00:05:23.480> one<00:05:23.690> because<00:05:23.720> it<00:05:24.110> is<00:05:24.140> the<00:05:24.470> largest<00:05:27.340> so

00:05:28.330 --> 00:05:28.340 
this one because it is the largest so

00:05:28.340 --> 00:05:30.190 
this one because it is the largest so
