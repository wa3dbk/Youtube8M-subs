 I'll explain how to get here in 

00:00:36.339 --> 00:00:42.010
 if you are in 4.1 in 5.1 or 

00:00:40.089 --> 00:00:45.100
 in whatever it is remembered that I am in 

00:00:42.010 --> 00:00:47.499
 6.0 then they will go up preserving the 

00:00:45.100 --> 00:00:49.389
 baseband I have the 5.13 I'm going to leave 

00:00:47.499 --> 00:00:51.909
 here the video here we will call 

00:00:49.389 --> 00:00:53.949
 how to climb preserving you must jones yes 

00:00:51.909 --> 00:00:56.889
 you have any other facebook that 

00:00:53.949 --> 00:00:59.139

00:00:56.889 --> 00:01:02.109
 just unlock until this 6 go 

00:00:59.139 --> 00:01:04.449
 until 5.30 he 6.15 which is the 

00:01:02.109 --> 00:01:07.600
 baseband the ipad is going to need a video 

00:01:04.449 --> 00:01:09.070
 to pass the baseband the ipad and then 

00:01:07.600 --> 00:01:11.020
 get down to this weisman that up here 

00:01:09.070 --> 00:01:15.460
 understand though let's go again let's say 

00:01:11.020 --> 00:01:18.340
 that you have the iphone 3gs 6.0 and 

00:01:15.460 --> 00:01:21.549
 have the baseband 5.16 that I think that 

00:01:18.340 --> 00:01:24.430
 is the baseband that goes up the 6.0 need 

00:01:21.549 --> 00:01:27.420
 move to 6.15 I'll give you the video 

00:01:24.430 --> 00:01:30.340
 here below and then they need to go down to 

00:01:27.420 --> 00:01:32.829
 5.13 all those videos are currently 

00:01:30.340 --> 00:01:36.429
 running smoothly now if you 

00:01:32.829 --> 00:01:39.579
 is in any other version you need 

00:01:36.429 --> 00:01:42.670
 go up to 6.0 and you have this same 

00:01:39.579 --> 00:01:45.249
 low page has the 6.15 plan you 

00:01:42.670 --> 00:01:46.570
 You need to upload while preserving your page 

00:01:45.249 --> 00:01:48.759
 I'm also going to leave the video here 

00:01:46.570 --> 00:01:50.320
 down here that I already did it or that in 

00:01:48.759 --> 00:01:52.719
 any other question also have 

00:01:50.320 --> 00:01:54.369
 been here below because almost everyone 

00:01:52.719 --> 00:01:56.920
 the videos are made here I'm in 

00:01:54.369 --> 00:01:59.409
 6.0 and obviously to do this 

00:01:56.920 --> 00:02:01.509
 I need to have more break and if not 

00:01:59.409 --> 00:02:03.539
 have I will leave the video here below 

00:02:01.509 --> 00:02:05.710
 also how to do the jailbreak in 

00:02:03.539 --> 00:02:08.320
 6.0 remember that this is a jailbreak 

00:02:05.710 --> 00:02:09.369
 semi a tester will save the video 

00:02:08.320 --> 00:02:11.950
 also share 

00:02:09.369 --> 00:02:14.500
 lotterer and then how to make it 

00:02:11.950 --> 00:02:16.090
 similar terque can be turned off and it 

00:02:14.500 --> 00:02:18.400
 can turn on but if he is not going to 

00:02:16.090 --> 00:02:21.489
 work then we really have to 

00:02:18.400 --> 00:02:24.040
 have silvia and let's go to cydia let's go 

00:02:21.489 --> 00:02:25.810
 to add this source and if you do not know much 

00:02:24.040 --> 00:02:27.250
 from sources and do not know how to add to a 

00:02:25.810 --> 00:02:29.049
 I'll also give you the video 

00:02:27.250 --> 00:02:30.849
 here below as I said it's going to be a 

00:02:29.049 --> 00:02:32.829
 reference video because I have to 

00:02:30.849 --> 00:02:34.810
 do a little bit fast and we're going to 

00:02:32.829 --> 00:02:37.720
 adding this source is going to be like a 

00:02:34.810 --> 00:02:40.780
 video only to tell you exactly 

00:02:37.720 --> 00:02:42.340
 what do they need to do let's go 

00:02:40.780 --> 00:02:44.739
 unless we're going to the sun 

00:02:42.340 --> 00:02:46.989
 we're going to avoid adding and we're going to 

00:02:44.739 --> 00:02:50.290
 add this font my people tap 

00:02:46.989 --> 00:02:51.730
 insein and dotcom I'll leave it here 

00:02:50.290 --> 00:02:53.980
 also the video so they know the 

00:02:51.730 --> 00:02:56.319
 source we need this source 

00:02:53.980 --> 00:02:58.390
 we are not going to install ultra is new that 

00:02:56.319 --> 00:03:00.489
 here there is order installed by you not 

00:02:58.390 --> 00:03:02.019
 install it follow my steps if they have it 

00:03:00.489 --> 00:03:04.450
 installed ultras we are not going to 

00:03:02.019 --> 00:03:06.579
 uninstall it ok install them a 3 no 

00:03:04.450 --> 00:03:08.780
 because what we're going to do is we're going 

00:03:06.579 --> 00:03:11.920
 to install him 

00:03:08.780 --> 00:03:14.420
 what will solve a 3 is not going to 

00:03:11.920 --> 00:03:17.060
 fix an error that there is currently 

00:03:14.420 --> 00:03:18.680
 with a 3 we will not see that is in case 

00:03:17.060 --> 00:03:20.420
 that I do not have installed I install them 

00:03:18.680 --> 00:03:23.120
 because I know that a lot of people have already tried 

00:03:20.420 --> 00:03:25.310
 and has installed together, but it has not 

00:03:23.120 --> 00:03:27.110
 operated as you can see already trained 

00:03:25.310 --> 00:03:31.760
 this time installed then in search 

00:03:27.110 --> 00:03:33.290
 let's look for the fixer as a 3 no and 

00:03:31.760 --> 00:03:35.450
 let's give this one that is here well 

00:03:33.290 --> 00:03:38.120
 the first one that leaves a 3 do not leave me 

00:03:35.450 --> 00:03:40.130
 make sure it's in the root pop 

00:03:38.120 --> 00:03:42.200
 insein you see that this year is 

00:03:40.130 --> 00:03:43.580
 rich and we will install it remember that 

00:03:42.200 --> 00:03:45.680
 I do not have ultras do not install me 

00:03:43.580 --> 00:03:48.110
 I'm just going to install the fixer that 

00:03:45.680 --> 00:03:51.500
 this fischer meeting this fischer is not going 

00:03:48.110 --> 00:03:54.560
 to install is why we can not 

00:03:51.500 --> 00:03:57.960
 have ultras not installed and once 

00:03:54.560 --> 00:04:01.770
 let's install to be in bourg 

00:03:57.960 --> 00:04:03.660
 here is going to travel we have to wait for it 

00:04:01.770 --> 00:04:06.780
 do the unlocking already if it lasts long 

00:04:03.660 --> 00:04:08.760
 Sorkin is because he is already searching and 

00:04:06.780 --> 00:04:10.530
 will unlock without any problem 

00:04:08.760 --> 00:04:12.000
 so what are you looking for that I like 

00:04:10.530 --> 00:04:13.710
 It's always grabbing stuff from the tee 

00:04:12.000 --> 00:04:15.990
 mobileye to show them that if you 

00:04:13.710 --> 00:04:18.090
 did I want to remind you that if this 

00:04:15.990 --> 00:04:20.280
 method does not work for you say that 

00:04:18.090 --> 00:04:22.530
 some reason does not work also another 

00:04:20.280 --> 00:04:24.690
 problem is that this method stops 

00:04:22.530 --> 00:04:26.550
 work sometimes like you fall a lot 

00:04:24.690 --> 00:04:28.200
 and his phone is of teeth he loves you 

00:04:26.550 --> 00:04:29.970
 unblock it we are doing 

00:04:28.200 --> 00:04:32.670
 I'll leave the two blocks too 

00:04:29.970 --> 00:04:34.740
 the link here below so you can 

00:04:32.670 --> 00:04:38.040
 unlock it in a way that we 

00:04:34.740 --> 00:04:40.290
 we recommend that paying that is if this 

00:04:38.040 --> 00:04:42.270
 method does not work but treat this that 

00:04:40.290 --> 00:04:44.430
 this one is free only for the score 

00:04:42.270 --> 00:04:46.800
 it also really works 

00:04:44.430 --> 00:04:49.770
 for four but it depends on the baseband 

00:04:46.800 --> 00:04:52.140
 I know that almost nobody has the baseband 1.59 

00:04:49.770 --> 00:04:54.180
 that's why I say I do not think I'm going 

00:04:52.140 --> 00:04:57.150
 to work for no your devices 

00:04:54.180 --> 00:04:59.940
 and as you can see finally found 

00:04:57.150 --> 00:05:01.620
 signal took a long time and teach is 

00:04:59.940 --> 00:05:04.520
 short because this is the only thing 

00:05:01.620 --> 00:05:06.720
 we have still point is not 

00:05:04.520 --> 00:05:09.000
 updated well in the way that is 

00:05:06.720 --> 00:05:11.729
 this is a small exit yet 

00:05:09.000 --> 00:05:13.169
 common good I lose signal I think that 

00:05:11.729 --> 00:05:15.030
 it can be because of two things that you 

00:05:13.169 --> 00:05:16.770
 they say can be my phone so much 

00:05:15.030 --> 00:05:18.690
 jordi that I have done and so many 

00:05:16.770 --> 00:05:21.389
 blocks that I have made 

00:05:18.690 --> 00:05:23.280
 I think it 's given a little bit damaged 

00:05:21.389 --> 00:05:25.680
 You see, there are so many times that I have come up and 

00:05:23.280 --> 00:05:27.539
 him lowered it would not be you but look 

00:05:25.680 --> 00:05:29.610
 there will start signal that goes up and down 

00:05:27.539 --> 00:05:31.740
 proceeds is being maintained as they 

00:05:29.610 --> 00:05:34.500
 I said to download all the reference videos 

00:05:31.740 --> 00:05:36.360
 to this one if you need something before 

00:05:34.500 --> 00:05:38.610
 ask please let's see the 

00:05:36.360 --> 00:05:40.830
 description and let's see if it's all 

00:05:38.610 --> 00:05:43.229
 what we need and if we can not 

00:05:40.830 --> 00:05:44.940
 ask and there I put it in the 

00:05:43.229 --> 00:05:48.120
 description so the description is 

00:05:44.940 --> 00:05:50.970

00:05:48.120 --> 00:05:52.740
