00:00:07.540 --> 00:00:11.860
 and well just how about friends of 

00:00:10.180 --> 00:00:14.920
 youtube good here I bring you a new 

00:00:11.860 --> 00:00:17.820
 video is of a new glitch like having 

00:00:14.920 --> 00:00:22.060
 the bonus box in minecraft 

00:00:17.820 --> 00:00:24.730
 infinite this for those who want to be 

00:00:22.060 --> 00:00:26.680
 in survival and not having to grab 

00:00:24.730 --> 00:00:28.960
 and gives them a lot of material that flojera 

00:00:26.680 --> 00:00:31.840
 well with this with this clichÃ© 

00:00:28.960 --> 00:00:33.730
 they can do it not this the first thing that 

00:00:31.840 --> 00:00:37.180
 Let's do is go create new world 

00:00:33.730 --> 00:00:39.440
 the name this one is like you 

00:00:37.180 --> 00:00:41.690
 want, I'll leave it like that 

00:00:39.440 --> 00:00:42.769
 and it can be in survival or in 

00:00:41.690 --> 00:00:44.660
 creative I'm going to leave it in 

00:00:42.769 --> 00:00:47.449
 survival so they see that also 

00:00:44.660 --> 00:00:50.930
 you can this was testing it on 

00:00:47.449 --> 00:00:53.260
 creative but you can also 

00:00:50.930 --> 00:00:56.870
 survival is not what they are going to do 

00:00:53.260 --> 00:00:59.479
 they go to this to put chest of 

00:00:56.870 --> 00:01:00.739
 bonus is very important as it 

00:00:59.479 --> 00:01:03.530
 only they have to do in more 

00:01:00.739 --> 00:01:05.869
 options in this is how you want 

00:01:03.530 --> 00:01:09.649
 peaceful survival is the same is not 

00:01:05.869 --> 00:01:12.110
 we give in creating new world and we are going to 

00:01:09.649 --> 00:01:14.210
 wait here to charge to generate 

00:01:12.110 --> 00:01:18.020
 the structure 

00:01:14.210 --> 00:01:20.960
 and this glitch will provide them with the 

00:01:18.020 --> 00:01:24.020
 materials in the food sometimes touch 

00:01:20.960 --> 00:01:26.600
 that leaves bread apples peaks and all that 

00:01:24.020 --> 00:01:30.260
 roll so they can build good 

00:01:26.600 --> 00:01:33.500
 this will make everything easier 

00:01:30.260 --> 00:01:34.820
 in what is being at the beginning this 

00:01:33.500 --> 00:01:36.260
 they can be doing it while 

00:01:34.820 --> 00:01:39.890
 you want in may be having 

00:01:36.260 --> 00:01:41.600
 the materials peaks and food of what 

00:01:39.890 --> 00:01:44.570
 they want 

00:01:41.600 --> 00:01:46.009
 this also will not affect him in the 

00:01:44.570 --> 00:01:48.470
 achievements already see that when they put in 

00:01:46.009 --> 00:01:50.210
 creative in game privileges says 

00:01:48.470 --> 00:01:54.680
 that achievements are not turned off 

00:01:50.210 --> 00:01:58.509
 with that will help them faster is it 

00:01:54.680 --> 00:02:00.530
 something that facilitates the game no 

00:01:58.509 --> 00:02:02.130
 are we going to wait here to be 

00:02:00.530 --> 00:02:05.039
 save 

00:02:02.130 --> 00:02:06.600
 to start ok here is that we are going to 

00:02:05.039 --> 00:02:08.369
 look for what is being the chest 

00:02:06.600 --> 00:02:09.860
 bonus to show them the 

00:02:08.369 --> 00:02:13.000
 switch 

00:02:09.860 --> 00:02:13.000
 sometimes I get the genre 

00:02:13.160 --> 00:02:16.990
 that peron of this brand 

00:02:17.540 --> 00:02:20.799
 in mixed form 

00:02:21.860 --> 00:02:26.670
 and good what they are going to have to do is 

00:02:24.569 --> 00:02:28.350
 remove the candles around 

00:02:26.670 --> 00:02:30.330
 well it is not necessarily remove the 

00:02:28.350 --> 00:02:32.640
 delicious only that I take them 

00:02:30.330 --> 00:02:35.250
 so you can know where the other is 

00:02:32.640 --> 00:02:38.040
 chest not what we're going to do is we're going to 

00:02:35.250 --> 00:02:40.080
 break the chest directly to not 

00:02:38.040 --> 00:02:42.840
 be pulling things out of the power a 

00:02:40.080 --> 00:02:45.810
 once we break the chest directly and 

00:02:42.840 --> 00:02:47.590
 we give start start the game and go out and 

00:02:45.810 --> 00:02:50.620
 save 

00:02:47.590 --> 00:02:52.750
 we are going to do this once 

00:02:50.620 --> 00:02:54.849
 that as I tell you how many times we want 

00:02:52.750 --> 00:02:56.620
 to be able to get the 

00:02:54.849 --> 00:02:58.900
 materials let's wait here right now 

00:02:56.620 --> 00:03:02.819
 that you save and you will see that right now 

00:02:58.900 --> 00:03:02.819
 reoccur in the chest 

00:03:02.940 --> 00:03:07.230
 so that see if the gray comes out the 

00:03:05.310 --> 00:03:09.890
 name that I gave him the new world 

00:03:07.230 --> 00:03:12.260
 we enter, we charge 

00:03:09.890 --> 00:03:14.620
 and as you can see there was not deactivated 

00:03:12.260 --> 00:03:18.530
 You can see that you already see that the 

00:03:14.620 --> 00:03:20.330
 message and then here we flip and here 

00:03:18.530 --> 00:03:22.850
 is the chest not here is the chest of 

00:03:20.330 --> 00:03:26.140
 bonus and well you can be 

00:03:22.850 --> 00:03:29.540
 doing is they give break the candles 

00:03:26.140 --> 00:03:31.880
 this breaks in the chest and only 

00:03:29.540 --> 00:03:33.290
 they go out and go out and save and so they 

00:03:31.880 --> 00:03:35.390
 they may be doing what you 

00:03:33.290 --> 00:03:37.820
 want to have the materials like 

00:03:35.390 --> 00:03:39.709
 they see half peaks apples wood peak 

00:03:37.820 --> 00:03:42.830
 stone two chests we already have two chests 

00:03:39.709 --> 00:03:44.540
 and put no weapons left and well then 

00:03:42.830 --> 00:03:46.400
