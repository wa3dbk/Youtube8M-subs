lost<00:02:29.690> five<00:02:29.870> players<00:02:30.200> already<00:02:30.350> let's<00:02:30.680> I<00:02:30.890> think

00:02:31.180 --> 00:02:31.190 
lost five players already let's I think

00:02:31.190 --> 00:02:32.230 
lost five players already let's I think
that's<00:02:31.340> kind<00:02:31.580> of<00:02:31.670> crazy

00:02:32.230 --> 00:02:32.240 
that's kind of crazy

00:02:32.240 --> 00:02:33.970 
that's kind of crazy
right<00:02:32.510> you<00:02:33.140> have<00:02:33.260> a<00:02:33.290> destructor<00:02:33.800> foods

00:02:33.970 --> 00:02:33.980 
right you have a destructor foods

00:02:33.980 --> 00:02:36.460 
right you have a destructor foods
tournament<00:02:34.370> I<00:02:34.400> think<00:02:34.430> is<00:02:34.640> pretty<00:02:34.820> cool<00:02:35.470> the

00:02:36.460 --> 00:02:36.470 
tournament I think is pretty cool the

00:02:36.470 --> 00:02:38.560 
tournament I think is pretty cool the
25k<00:02:37.160> structure<00:02:37.820> they<00:02:37.940> had<00:02:38.090> I<00:02:38.120> didn't<00:02:38.450> like

00:02:38.560 --> 00:02:38.570 
25k structure they had I didn't like

00:02:38.570 --> 00:02:39.580 
25k structure they had I didn't like
that<00:02:38.600> much<00:02:38.750> I<00:02:38.930> thought<00:02:39.020> that<00:02:39.200> was<00:02:39.290> actually<00:02:39.380> a

00:02:39.580 --> 00:02:39.590 
that much I thought that was actually a

00:02:39.590 --> 00:02:41.320 
that much I thought that was actually a
little<00:02:39.710> too<00:02:39.920> fast<00:02:40.100> but<00:02:40.910> you<00:02:40.970> know<00:02:41.090> most

00:02:41.320 --> 00:02:41.330 
little too fast but you know most

00:02:41.330 --> 00:02:43.240 
little too fast but you know most
tournaments<00:02:41.570> like<00:02:42.380> especially<00:02:42.680> the<00:02:42.890> serious

00:02:43.240 --> 00:02:43.250 
tournaments like especially the serious

00:02:43.250 --> 00:02:44.470 
tournaments like especially the serious
tournaments<00:02:43.580> and<00:02:43.640> stuff<00:02:43.730> even<00:02:44.120> with<00:02:44.210> the<00:02:44.300> bets

00:02:44.470 --> 00:02:44.480 
tournaments and stuff even with the bets

00:02:44.480 --> 00:02:45.880 
tournaments and stuff even with the bets
I<00:02:44.600> had<00:02:44.750> all<00:02:45.050> the<00:02:45.200> time<00:02:45.380> I<00:02:45.410> show<00:02:45.650> up<00:02:45.740> an<00:02:45.800> hour

00:02:45.880 --> 00:02:45.890 
I had all the time I show up an hour

00:02:45.890 --> 00:02:49.090 
I had all the time I show up an hour
late<00:02:46.190> or<00:02:46.340> two<00:02:46.460> hours<00:02:46.730> late<00:02:47.350> because<00:02:48.350> the<00:02:48.800> you'd

00:02:49.090 --> 00:02:49.100 
late or two hours late because the you'd

00:02:49.100 --> 00:02:50.530 
late or two hours late because the you'd
start<00:02:49.340> with<00:02:49.430> like<00:02:49.520> 300<00:02:49.700> big<00:02:49.970> blinds<00:02:50.180> and<00:02:50.420> it

00:02:50.530 --> 00:02:50.540 
start with like 300 big blinds and it

00:02:50.540 --> 00:02:53.290 
start with like 300 big blinds and it
was<00:02:50.630> just<00:02:50.810> really<00:02:51.170> silly<00:02:51.530> and<00:02:52.300> sometimes

00:02:53.290 --> 00:02:53.300 
was just really silly and sometimes

00:02:53.300 --> 00:02:55.060 
was just really silly and sometimes
you'd<00:02:53.450> even<00:02:53.540> start<00:02:53.840> with<00:02:53.930> more<00:02:54.170> this<00:02:54.740> one<00:02:54.950> you

00:02:55.060 --> 00:02:55.070 
you'd even start with more this one you

00:02:55.070 --> 00:02:58.240 
you'd even start with more this one you
start<00:02:55.340> with<00:02:55.510> 200<00:02:56.510> big<00:02:56.840> ones<00:02:57.050> but<00:02:57.230> it's<00:02:57.350> 500<00:02:57.770> 500

00:02:58.240 --> 00:02:58.250 
start with 200 big ones but it's 500 500

00:02:58.250 --> 00:02:59.500 
start with 200 big ones but it's 500 500
so<00:02:58.520> it's<00:02:58.670> like<00:02:58.880> and<00:02:59.090> you<00:02:59.210> start<00:02:59.390> with<00:02:59.480> a

00:02:59.500 --> 00:02:59.510 
so it's like and you start with a

00:02:59.510 --> 00:03:01.690 
so it's like and you start with a
hundred<00:02:59.780> thousand<00:03:00.110> so<00:03:00.230> it's<00:03:00.260> not<00:03:00.530> you<00:03:01.310> know<00:03:01.430> it

00:03:01.690 --> 00:03:01.700 
hundred thousand so it's not you know it

00:03:01.700 --> 00:03:03.460 
hundred thousand so it's not you know it
would<00:03:01.820> be<00:03:01.850> like<00:03:01.940> starting<00:03:02.480> at<00:03:02.540> 300<00:03:02.870> 600<00:03:03.080> or

00:03:03.460 --> 00:03:03.470 
would be like starting at 300 600 or

00:03:03.470 --> 00:03:06.790 
would be like starting at 300 600 or
maybe<00:03:03.680> even<00:03:03.770> you<00:03:04.700> know<00:03:04.870> 300<00:03:05.870> 650<00:03:06.350> or<00:03:06.530> something

00:03:06.790 --> 00:03:06.800 
maybe even you know 300 650 or something

00:03:06.800 --> 00:03:10.930 
maybe even you know 300 650 or something
like<00:03:06.860> that<00:03:08.350> so<00:03:09.350> it's<00:03:09.530> not<00:03:09.650> that<00:03:09.710> bad<00:03:10.070> like<00:03:10.370> it's

00:03:10.930 --> 00:03:10.940 
like that so it's not that bad like it's

00:03:10.940 --> 00:03:11.950 
like that so it's not that bad like it's
not<00:03:11.120> where<00:03:11.240> you're<00:03:11.300> gonna<00:03:11.450> win<00:03:11.660> a<00:03:11.690> bunch<00:03:11.900> of

00:03:11.950 --> 00:03:11.960

pots<00:03:12.140> in<00:03:12.290> the<00:03:12.350> first<00:03:12.530> level<00:03:12.710> and<00:03:13.070> then<00:03:13.250> it

00:03:13.480 --> 00:03:13.490 
pots in the first level and then it

00:03:13.490 --> 00:03:14.500 
pots in the first level and then it
doesn't<00:03:13.640> matter<00:03:13.820> and<00:03:14.060> you<00:03:14.120> increase<00:03:14.390> your

00:03:14.500 --> 00:03:14.510 
doesn't matter and you increase your

00:03:14.510 --> 00:03:16.480 
doesn't matter and you increase your
stack<00:03:14.690> about<00:03:14.840> 10%<00:03:15.320> kind<00:03:15.500> of<00:03:15.560> thing<00:03:15.710> the<00:03:16.160> second

00:03:16.480 --> 00:03:16.490 
stack about 10% kind of thing the second

00:03:16.490 --> 00:03:18.010 
stack about 10% kind of thing the second
level<00:03:16.610> is<00:03:16.730> 500,000<00:03:17.480> so<00:03:17.600> that's<00:03:17.720> pretty<00:03:17.900> sweet

00:03:18.010 --> 00:03:18.020 
level is 500,000 so that's pretty sweet

00:03:18.020 --> 00:03:19.570 
level is 500,000 so that's pretty sweet
it's<00:03:18.290> there's<00:03:18.830> like<00:03:18.950> a<00:03:19.010> bunch<00:03:19.190> of<00:03:19.280> chips<00:03:19.490> in

00:03:19.570 --> 00:03:19.580 
it's there's like a bunch of chips in

00:03:19.580 --> 00:03:20.740 
it's there's like a bunch of chips in
the<00:03:19.640> middle<00:03:19.730> early<00:03:20.090> because<00:03:20.240> it<00:03:20.330> always<00:03:20.450> sucks

00:03:20.740 --> 00:03:20.750 
the middle early because it always sucks

00:03:20.750 --> 00:03:22.390 
the middle early because it always sucks
