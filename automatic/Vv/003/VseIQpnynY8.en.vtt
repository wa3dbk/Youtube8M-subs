film so we got the texture and to feel
the<00:00:25.500> grain<00:00:25.769> and<00:00:26.070> when<00:00:26.189> we<00:00:26.279> took<00:00:26.400> it<00:00:26.550> 3d<00:00:26.820> we

00:00:26.990 --> 00:00:27.000 
the grain and when we took it 3d we

00:00:27.000 --> 00:00:28.970 
the grain and when we took it 3d we
literally<00:00:27.570> have<00:00:27.779> to<00:00:27.810> take<00:00:28.019> every<00:00:28.410> frame<00:00:28.710> and

00:00:28.970 --> 00:00:28.980

gonna be kick ass of course precious it
is<00:01:33.850> very<00:01:34.240> akin<00:01:34.630> to<00:01:34.690> an<00:01:34.930> animation<00:01:35.289> process<00:01:35.680> or

00:01:36.149 --> 00:01:36.159 
is very akin to an animation process or

is very akin to an animation process or
a<00:01:36.190> visual<00:01:36.700> effects<00:01:36.909> process<00:01:37.330> and<00:01:37.539> that<00:01:37.659> you<00:01:37.840> do

00:01:38.010 --> 00:01:38.020 
a visual effects process and that you do

00:01:38.020 --> 00:01:40.169 
a visual effects process and that you do
iterations<00:01:38.649> you<00:01:38.979> can<00:01:39.190> push<00:01:39.399> the<00:01:39.640> length<00:01:39.850> of<00:01:40.060> a

iterations you can push the length of a
space<00:01:40.509> or<00:01:41.259> you<00:01:41.500> can<00:01:41.740> push<00:01:42.369> together<00:01:42.580> the<00:01:43.060> prox

00:01:52.980 --> 00:01:52.990 
20 30 40 iterations and we SAT there

00:01:52.990 --> 00:01:55.620 
20 30 40 iterations and we SAT there
watching<00:01:53.619> every<00:01:54.250> frame<00:01:54.520> of<00:01:54.550> our<00:01:54.759> movie<00:01:55.119> bit<00:01:55.450> by

00:01:55.620 --> 00:01:55.630 
watching every frame of our movie bit by

00:02:00.889 --> 00:02:00.899 

00:02:00.899 --> 00:02:02.850 

the<00:02:01.899> missiles<00:02:02.289> was<00:02:02.470> a<00:02:02.590> really<00:02:02.830> interesting

00:02:02.850 --> 00:02:02.860 
the missiles was a really interesting

00:02:02.860 --> 00:02:04.649 
the missiles was a really interesting
thing<00:02:03.399> gets<00:02:03.610> as<00:02:03.819> Earth<00:02:04.060> got<00:02:04.330> bigger<00:02:04.569> and

00:02:04.649 --> 00:02:04.659 
thing gets as Earth got bigger and

00:02:04.659 --> 00:02:05.999 
thing gets as Earth got bigger and
bigger<00:02:04.780> in<00:02:05.020> 3d<00:02:05.319> the<00:02:05.470> missiles<00:02:05.799> started

00:02:05.999 --> 00:02:06.009 
bigger in 3d the missiles started

00:02:06.009 --> 00:02:07.919 
bigger in 3d the missiles started
looking<00:02:06.310> smaller<00:02:06.580> and<00:02:06.819> smaller<00:02:07.000> you<00:02:07.240> know<00:02:07.390> so

00:02:07.919 --> 00:02:07.929 
looking smaller and smaller you know so

00:02:07.929 --> 00:02:08.969 
looking smaller and smaller you know so
then<00:02:08.049> we're<00:02:08.140> like<00:02:08.259> well<00:02:08.410> that's<00:02:08.590> not<00:02:08.799> the

00:02:08.969 --> 00:02:08.979 
then we're like well that's not the

00:02:08.979 --> 00:02:10.410 
then we're like well that's not the
right<00:02:09.100> thing<00:02:09.160> because<00:02:09.670> hell<00:02:09.880> on<00:02:10.030> earth<00:02:10.239> is

00:02:10.410 --> 00:02:10.420 
right thing because hell on earth is

00:02:10.420 --> 00:02:11.640 
right thing because hell on earth is
about<00:02:10.660> to<00:02:10.780> occur<00:02:11.019> with<00:02:11.170> these<00:02:11.260> missiles<00:02:11.590> they

00:02:11.640 --> 00:02:11.650 
about to occur with these missiles they

00:02:11.650 --> 00:02:13.530 
about to occur with these missiles they
gotta<00:02:11.829> have<00:02:11.920> some<00:02:12.130> scaling<00:02:12.430> John<00:02:13.269> had<00:02:13.420> this

00:02:13.530 --> 00:02:13.540 
gotta have some scaling John had this

00:02:13.540 --> 00:02:15.390 
gotta have some scaling John had this
idea<00:02:13.720> of<00:02:14.019> taking<00:02:14.320> the<00:02:14.530> missile<00:02:14.680> outside<00:02:15.220> the

00:02:15.390 --> 00:02:15.400 
idea of taking the missile outside the

00:02:15.400 --> 00:02:17.160 
idea of taking the missile outside the
frame<00:02:15.640> really<00:02:15.940> and<00:02:16.239> so<00:02:16.420> as<00:02:16.660> an<00:02:16.840> audience

00:02:17.160 --> 00:02:17.170 
frame really and so as an audience

00:02:17.170 --> 00:02:18.630 
frame really and so as an audience
you're<00:02:17.410> sitting<00:02:17.650> here<00:02:17.799> and<00:02:17.920> the<00:02:17.980> missile<00:02:18.430> sort

00:02:18.630 --> 00:02:18.640 
you're sitting here and the missile sort

00:02:18.640 --> 00:02:21.180 
you're sitting here and the missile sort
of<00:02:18.700> goes<00:02:18.820> right<00:02:19.030> over<00:02:19.060> your<00:02:19.360> head<00:02:19.959> and<00:02:19.989> face<00:02:20.320> so

00:02:21.180 --> 00:02:21.190 
of goes right over your head and face so

00:02:21.190 --> 00:02:22.890 
of goes right over your head and face so
then<00:02:21.340> you<00:02:21.430> really<00:02:21.790> feel<00:02:22.030> it<00:02:22.239> sends<00:02:22.540> a<00:02:22.600> scale

00:02:22.890 --> 00:02:22.900 
then you really feel it sends a scale

00:02:22.900 --> 00:02:24.599 
then you really feel it sends a scale
and<00:02:23.170> that's<00:02:23.769> not<00:02:23.920> something<00:02:24.100> we<00:02:24.340> could<00:02:24.519> have

00:02:24.599 --> 00:02:24.609 
and that's not something we could have

00:02:24.609 --> 00:02:27.240 
and that's not something we could have
done<00:02:24.730> in<00:02:24.880> 2d

00:02:27.240 --> 00:02:27.250 

00:02:27.250 --> 00:02:28.770 

every<00:02:27.880> little<00:02:28.090> thing<00:02:28.270> we're<00:02:28.420> discovering

00:02:28.770 --> 00:02:28.780 
every little thing we're discovering

00:02:28.780 --> 00:02:30.570 
every little thing we're discovering
dictates<00:02:29.380> other<00:02:29.560> things<00:02:29.830> like<00:02:29.950> sound<00:02:30.280> like

00:02:30.570 --> 00:02:30.580 
dictates other things like sound like

00:02:30.580 --> 00:02:31.620 
dictates other things like sound like
suddenly<00:02:30.850> when<00:02:30.880> you<00:02:31.090> have<00:02:31.210> everything<00:02:31.360> coming

00:02:31.620 --> 00:02:31.630 
suddenly when you have everything coming

00:02:31.630 --> 00:02:33.420 
suddenly when you have everything coming
up<00:02:31.810> from<00:02:31.990> the<00:02:32.050> side<00:02:32.320> of<00:02:32.380> your<00:02:32.500> head<00:02:32.620> now<00:02:33.070> sound

00:02:33.420 --> 00:02:33.430 
up from the side of your head now sound

00:02:33.430 --> 00:02:34.740 
up from the side of your head now sound
gets<00:02:33.670> an<00:02:33.760> idea<00:02:33.850> like<00:02:34.090> oh<00:02:34.240> we<00:02:34.450> can<00:02:34.600> make<00:02:34.720> that

00:02:34.740 --> 00:02:34.750 
gets an idea like oh we can make that

00:02:34.750 --> 00:02:40.080 
gets an idea like oh we can make that
thing<00:02:35.140> fly<00:02:35.440> right<00:02:36.010> by<00:02:36.190> your<00:02:36.370> ear
