 car 

00:00:11.320 --> 00:00:19.030
 Sark looks strange this kind of case 

00:00:15.080 --> 00:00:23.130
 If it isn't fishing that will pass already and pan and react 

00:00:19.030 --> 00:00:23.130
 An intense reaction effect 

00:00:27.500 --> 00:00:29.980
 dn 

00:00:32.070 --> 00:00:35.180

00:00:38.690 --> 00:00:43.090
 en's 

00:00:40.640 --> 00:00:46.590
 FT 2 luck 

00:00:43.090 --> 00:00:46.590
 This is the most annoying tn 

00:00:46.730 --> 00:00:52.700
 A shallow flat in Bun'nage the 

00:00:50.220 --> 00:00:52.700
 Early winding 

00:00:55.180 --> 00:00:59.880
 This now reel 

00:00:57.070 --> 00:00:59.880
 I hate it 

00:01:00.390 --> 00:01:04.710
 Equivalent 

00:01:02.079 --> 00:01:04.710
 It is early 

00:01:04.850 --> 00:01:10.690
 But I have to move it 's out amazing high speed 

00:01:08.470 --> 00:01:13.320
 Bus splash 

00:01:10.690 --> 00:01:13.320
 Can react 

00:01:16.350 --> 00:01:19.250
 Can react at all 

00:01:19.530 --> 00:01:27.990
 Has such absolute taken to say so Toka or have at stake that kind of a bit of a Uido 

00:01:24.280 --> 00:01:31.280
 Honma Tatsuko Stone Place Sweet 

00:01:27.990 --> 00:01:31.280
 If you look far in front of you 

00:01:31.350 --> 00:01:35.000
 It's gone fluoride and 

00:01:43.820 --> 00:01:50.210
 Winter field pond and whether I November he say another winter 

00:01:47.850 --> 00:01:53.590
 Once only is it cold 

00:01:50.210 --> 00:01:53.590
 I like this kind of fishing 

00:01:53.960 --> 00:01:57.909
 First Hey, you should try to go to first and foremost 

00:02:00.050 --> 00:02:05.259
 It is a verbal you said 

00:02:02.810 --> 00:02:05.259
 I'm armor 

00:02:05.350 --> 00:02:11.869
 Yes, I just hit the bread for a moment 

00:02:09.119 --> 00:02:11.869
 Against lure 

00:02:12.350 --> 00:02:17.870
 Because I'm just hitting for a moment 

00:02:15.210 --> 00:02:17.870
 Like now 

00:02:18.390 --> 00:02:24.500
 Hey there is a momentary byte 

00:02:22.319 --> 00:02:24.500
 The hand 

00:02:24.550 --> 00:02:28.440
 Apparently I want to see this situationally 

00:02:38.230 --> 00:02:42.360
 Once the temperature bottoms out 

00:02:43.400 --> 00:02:50.540
 I 'm going to roll around 

00:02:45.870 --> 00:02:50.540
 In the case of dl it 's an idiot vibration 

00:02:50.620 --> 00:02:55.470
 It is not from mega that what is decisively different in comparison with 

00:02:57.080 --> 00:03:01.800
 Normal 

00:02:59.400 --> 00:03:05.180
 5 race Nde this oblique 

00:03:01.800 --> 00:03:09.129
 I'm swimming while facing downwards 

00:03:05.180 --> 00:03:09.129
 That's it, I bow my head 

00:03:11.170 --> 00:03:14.520
 I will avoid obstacles 

00:03:16.160 --> 00:03:24.610
 There are various types of vibes and that horizontal guy and so on 

00:03:21.490 --> 00:03:27.970
 Just call around 45 degrees 

00:03:24.610 --> 00:03:29.710
 Not tl or did head lower much like a Fe bl 

00:03:27.970 --> 00:03:35.310
 Really 

00:03:29.710 --> 00:03:35.310
 Since the center of gravity to go is attached to the mouth of Sakitcho 

00:03:36.150 --> 00:03:42.430
 He will come 

00:03:38.230 --> 00:03:44.160
 Caught roughly Once you crazy throwing a 2 Okapparide Kondake No. vibration 

00:03:42.430 --> 00:03:47.780
 I will eliminate it 

00:03:44.160 --> 00:03:47.780
 But the leap year will not disappear until the end 

00:03:49.460 --> 00:03:53.520
 Especially that 

00:03:50.900 --> 00:03:57.940
 It is good to pull rocks 

00:03:53.520 --> 00:04:01.129
 If I pull out the place with the usual vibration, I'm still hooked 

00:03:57.940 --> 00:04:03.860
 After all nail changes 

00:04:01.129 --> 00:04:05.490
 If you say that there is Kasumigaura 

00:04:03.860 --> 00:04:07.240
 Masonry 

00:04:05.490 --> 00:04:09.720
 Lip wrap 

00:04:07.240 --> 00:04:09.720
 There is such a thing 

00:04:10.540 --> 00:04:16.380
 Scan the survival rate to at all 

00:04:13.420 --> 00:04:16.380
 I'm coming back 

00:04:16.620 --> 00:04:23.840
 Mayu Toka that of Nantes sandbags 

00:04:20.489 --> 00:04:23.840
 Net like a for-sensitive zero 

00:04:39.340 --> 00:04:44.189
 Oh Sha 

00:04:40.689 --> 00:04:44.189
 I've come 

00:04:44.949 --> 00:04:48.790
 reaction 

00:04:46.849 --> 00:04:55.240

00:04:48.790 --> 00:04:57.700
 Also cold bus many times not, but the other wider el without permission 

00:04:55.240 --> 00:05:03.040
 This is not a winter fish 

00:04:57.700 --> 00:05:07.510
 I do has become something negative with my god as also her sister Anne shoe 

00:05:03.040 --> 00:05:08.569
 Well maybe this fish responded to vibration and this fish was just old poke 

00:05:07.510 --> 00:05:09.700
 May 

00:05:08.569 --> 00:05:13.280
 but 

00:05:09.700 --> 00:05:16.220
 We put a great softening cold wide location 

00:05:13.280 --> 00:05:21.100
 When not eating on Inver 's favorite bike 

00:05:16.220 --> 00:05:23.389
 Turn it into a small needle base and give it a fiery guy 

00:05:21.100 --> 00:05:25.990
 Like that 

00:05:23.389 --> 00:05:25.990
 There is
