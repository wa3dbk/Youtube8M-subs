00:00:00.059 --> 00:00:03.429
 like the previous week, we made a scan and saw that your skin is a bit better 

00:00:03.429 --> 00:00:07.020
 nutrient deficiency comes yes now we want to do skin improvement with the special 

00:00:07.020 --> 00:00:09.619
 collagen production therapy 

00:00:09.619 --> 00:00:13.349
 why you have to get the most out of your skin should already be so healthy 

00:00:13.349 --> 00:00:15.189
 to be possible 

00:00:15.189 --> 00:00:18.500
 if you look from your heart then you see that epidermis we had seen before 

00:00:18.499 --> 00:00:19.220
 that you there 

00:00:19.220 --> 00:00:22.470
 A barrier of strong must make you the engine 

00:00:22.470 --> 00:00:24.650
 what are we going to do some work 

00:00:24.650 --> 00:00:28.770
 on the package no makes behind that the leather skin with all those fibers 

00:00:28.770 --> 00:00:31.609
 a certain direction on the allegations where it is weakest 

00:00:31.609 --> 00:00:34.280
 Ricky Koole no fibers that look like this 

00:00:34.280 --> 00:00:35.660
 then all sit 

00:00:35.660 --> 00:00:40.370
 small pieces that produce that these are not cells but that becomes continuous 

00:00:40.370 --> 00:00:41.020
 updated 

00:00:41.020 --> 00:00:44.580
 those bits that proposition that could be 4 on wall street die 

00:00:44.580 --> 00:00:45.180
 stuff 

00:00:45.180 --> 00:00:47.520
 we go so that it worked very well 

00:00:47.520 --> 00:00:49.630
 how do we do that have a therapy for that 

00:00:49.630 --> 00:00:51.900
 The therapy that is called Michael Laat Ling 

00:00:51.900 --> 00:00:55.780
 total effective teeth collagen induction therapy 

00:00:55.780 --> 00:00:59.020
 we make a lot of mikel fairy tales small holes 

00:00:59.020 --> 00:01:01.819
 Then we have deliberately provided a short-lived 

00:01:01.819 --> 00:01:04.320
 inflammation so not inflammation 

00:01:04.320 --> 00:01:07.410
 I think ensure tissue repair 

00:01:07.410 --> 00:01:09.550
 because he generates that inflammation 

00:01:09.550 --> 00:01:10.580
 very short 

00:01:10.580 --> 00:01:13.820
 if you need to be as healthy as possible, it will only be very short and you will have otherwise 

00:01:13.820 --> 00:01:15.540
 said red for a few days 

00:01:15.540 --> 00:01:18.010
 why are we going to adjust our feeding on the seals 

00:01:18.010 --> 00:01:21.900
 The more oily fish you eat, the more omega 3 series you get 

00:01:21.900 --> 00:01:22.909
 as healthy 

00:01:22.909 --> 00:01:27.490
 from a lot of aspects especially with this man I had with what was different 

00:01:27.490 --> 00:01:31.570
 perpetrators watch with seemingly like gillet a few flat something every day 

00:01:31.570 --> 00:01:32.930
 you can also eat with it 

00:01:32.930 --> 00:01:35.189
 is all hand-colored vegetables and fruit 

00:01:35.189 --> 00:01:35.969
 why is that 

00:01:35.969 --> 00:01:40.869
 in addition to those omega 3 fats you also need a vitamin d3 and that makes it 

00:01:40.869 --> 00:01:42.700
 in your heart 

00:01:42.700 --> 00:01:45.880
 to get the most out of what you can enjoy in the sun in the middle of the day 

00:01:46.460 --> 00:01:51.020
 twenty thirty songs maximum that should never burn and to prevent that 

00:01:51.020 --> 00:01:55.359
 you don't burn you as many colorful vegetables as possible and ask 

00:01:55.359 --> 00:01:58.899
 to be sure that you get everything when you get it for optimum 

00:01:58.899 --> 00:02:02.120
 For safety you look at some more incentives with the advise 

00:02:02.120 --> 00:02:06.740
 that are rich in collagen peptides from fresh fruit fall and even you stand like that 

00:02:06.740 --> 00:02:07.909
 easily possible 

00:02:07.909 --> 00:02:11.519
 everything absorbs and can get lost in your skin yes then you are doing very well 

00:02:12.099 --> 00:02:15.510
 we see if a while with the scanning or birthday woman has gone out and if we 

00:02:15.510 --> 00:02:18.809
 say after an hour a good state the driver behind 

00:02:18.809 --> 00:02:20.309
 what do you think of the plans I'm going for
