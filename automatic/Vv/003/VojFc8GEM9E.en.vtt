00:00:02.370 --> 00:00:04.760
 we fear inspectors 

00:00:04.760 --> 00:00:07.020
 number to 4 

00:00:07.020 --> 00:00:09.969
 his agent spun us 

00:00:09.969 --> 00:00:11.619
 meaning 

00:00:11.619 --> 00:00:14.219
 geopolitical uncertainties 

00:00:14.219 --> 00:00:16.339
 as for the match 

00:00:16.339 --> 00:00:19.380
 it is these practices 

00:00:19.380 --> 00:00:21.560
 for as many grants 

00:00:21.560 --> 00:00:22.689
 during the euro 

00:00:22.689 --> 00:00:25.689
 league 1 still nice 

00:00:42.620 --> 00:00:45.810
 and his eyes of all and it's after a little absence against finds on this 

00:00:45.810 --> 00:00:49.280
 seventh episode this morning kaunas go relatively different from what I have 

00:00:49.280 --> 00:00:52.760
 already been able to present it I hope that most of you will have the spirit 

00:00:52.760 --> 00:00:56.520
 open enough not to fall on the possible prejudices for last night 

00:00:56.520 --> 00:00:59.420
 so why do I say that just because this manga is 

00:00:59.420 --> 00:01:02.080
 difficult to handle especially for the youngest 

00:01:02.080 --> 00:01:05.400
 but the idea of ​​press points later before I started I wanted to 

00:01:05.400 --> 00:01:06.950
 tell you that the latter for me 

00:01:06.950 --> 00:01:09.950
 Peru is one of the few to have vibrated from the first volumes 

00:01:10.460 --> 00:01:13.090
 without waiting for the manga I decided to introduce you today 

00:01:13.090 --> 00:01:15.220
 eric ascension 

00:01:15.220 --> 00:01:18.410
 Ascension is thus a finished manga published in France by the editions 

00:01:18.410 --> 00:01:21.830
 delcourt for a little over four years and has a total of 17 hours 

00:01:22.340 --> 00:01:25.660
 it was written and drawn by shin'ichi sakamoto in mangaka that 

00:01:25.660 --> 00:01:29.120
 I love just for this world but also for thomas road it is not for 

00:01:29.120 --> 00:01:30.930
 knocked from also edited by us 

00:01:30.930 --> 00:01:34.410
 climbing mainly deals with mountaineering to my knowledge that he 

00:01:34.410 --> 00:01:36.190
 a little who approaches this topic 

00:01:36.190 --> 00:01:39.320
 now the new master is not you certainly say caennais the 

00:01:39.320 --> 00:01:41.720
 subject does not look super exciting 

00:01:41.720 --> 00:01:44.080
 and I grant you it is far from in I am even sports like 

00:01:44.080 --> 00:01:46.130
 whimsical to the killer menu 

00:01:46.130 --> 00:01:48.700
 at the beginning i admit to having a lot of apprehension not being 

00:01:48.700 --> 00:01:51.190
 especially mountaineering fan even climbed 

00:01:51.190 --> 00:01:53.860
 but who would have thought it would give such a deep story 

00:01:53.860 --> 00:01:55.870
 and interesting 

00:01:55.870 --> 00:01:59.490
 history tells us so evident morricone of euros a young dog who 

00:01:59.490 --> 00:02:02.290
 has just been transferred to a new high school 

00:02:02.290 --> 00:02:04.600
 it is enough noticed after due to his character and personality 

00:02:04.600 --> 00:02:07.680
 waiting felt social and gets harassed by a student of his class 

00:02:07.680 --> 00:02:09.870
 higgins and miyamoto 

00:02:09.870 --> 00:02:12.630
 the latter has indeed challenged what has helped the walls of 

00:02:12.630 --> 00:02:15.710
 school and get to the roof after that they would stop the 

00:02:15.710 --> 00:02:19.370
 sunshade morris unwillingly accepts the surprise of the motorcycle 

00:02:20.169 --> 00:02:23.239
 he then starts his first climb are taking care of any strings 

00:02:23.239 --> 00:02:24.339
 security 

00:02:24.339 --> 00:02:27.939
 and encana without sion did not start to tire but his envy and his 

00:02:27.939 --> 00:02:31.179
 will to succeed you have to push your limits and it gives way to your 

00:02:31.179 --> 00:02:31.999
 instinct 

00:02:31.999 --> 00:02:34.999
 and that's where he feels a whole new feeling 

00:02:38.119 --> 00:02:41.119
 nothing ostentatious 

00:02:42.689 --> 00:02:44.689
 essential 

00:02:44.689 --> 00:02:47.219
 the feeling of being alive 

00:02:47.219 --> 00:02:49.859
 and it is from this event that the growing passion of our 

00:02:49.859 --> 00:02:51.490
 hero for the authors of the goals 

00:02:51.490 --> 00:02:55.410
 following this episode of their head teacher policemen reprimand morris 

00:02:55.410 --> 00:02:57.939
 and miyamoto for this dangerous twist 

00:02:57.939 --> 00:03:00.599
 but on the other hand as a former climber he could only be 

00:03:00.599 --> 00:03:03.419
 impressed by the potential of morels and understands quite the 

00:03:03.419 --> 00:03:06.289
 feeling that he has just felt 

00:03:06.289 --> 00:03:09.529
 it will be necessary later to help them develop his talent 

00:03:09.529 --> 00:03:13.259
 the ump the first volume is not at all representative of the manga at the beginning 

00:03:13.259 --> 00:03:17.119
 expects in music-centric scenario scenario here and we'll see joined the 

00:03:17.119 --> 00:03:18.240
 climbing club 

00:03:18.240 --> 00:03:22.289
 he participates in tournaments a love story rivals rivals 

00:03:22.289 --> 00:03:24.069
 but that's not the case at all 

00:03:24.069 --> 00:03:27.639
 indeed although the first volume to suggest a typical development of a 

00:03:27.639 --> 00:03:28.969
 sporty shaman 

00:03:28.969 --> 00:03:31.939
 we will quickly see that the manga takes a totally different turn after 

00:03:31.939 --> 00:03:34.949
 an event that I respect as usual discover 

00:03:34.949 --> 00:03:37.829
 and we will realize that it is really a Caen does not say 

00:03:37.829 --> 00:03:38.869
 something else 

00:03:38.869 --> 00:03:43.189
 this manga addresses several themes including social marginalization death but 

00:03:43.189 --> 00:03:45.699
 still the power for women's childhood on the man 

00:03:45.699 --> 00:03:48.699
 and the very first lover impacting shot concentrating on mountaineering 

00:03:49.579 --> 00:03:53.109
 never would I have imagined any cassation could have been to this point sickology 

00:03:53.109 --> 00:03:54.249
 is intense 

00:03:54.249 --> 00:03:56.799
 q - after reading the first volume 

00:03:56.799 --> 00:04:00.079
 I want to do besides being surprised that's what made me hang 

00:04:00.079 --> 00:04:02.109
 to the manga 

00:04:02.109 --> 00:04:05.299
 even if the scenario is different it happens in high speed concrete 

00:04:05.299 --> 00:04:09.180
 third personages which slightly level down so when I pulled 

00:04:09.180 --> 00:04:11.879
 downwards it's rather a bias by the mangaka that has me personally 

00:04:11.879 --> 00:04:14.829
 the death of more or less doubtful at the beginning 

00:04:14.829 --> 00:04:18.489
 apparently yes the others are not at all developed the story is focusing 

00:04:18.489 --> 00:04:19.989
 totally on our hero 

00:04:19.989 --> 00:04:22.759
 the others still have their share of importance 

00:04:22.759 --> 00:04:24.020
 morris was a bit of a comment 

00:04:24.020 --> 00:04:26.430
 the newborn who discovers the world like who discover the 

00:04:26.430 --> 00:04:29.620
 different facets of the personality of the man with a big h 

00:04:29.620 --> 00:04:32.770
 he is presented both as an asocial character but also as 

00:04:32.770 --> 00:04:34.879
 an innocent cure character 

00:04:34.879 --> 00:04:37.879
 in the background it's even a bit of a sono and masculine 

00:04:39.599 --> 00:04:42.039
 in words are nothing else 

00:04:42.039 --> 00:04:45.039
 as soon as low-Laurentian territory 

00:04:46.460 --> 00:04:48.379
 mysterious 

00:04:48.379 --> 00:04:51.550
 all he wants is what has degraded and as and when his 

00:04:51.550 --> 00:04:53.620
 experiences and facing adversity 

00:04:53.620 --> 00:04:56.060
 not only are they growing up as climbers but also as 

00:04:56.060 --> 00:04:57.110
 than human 

00:04:57.110 --> 00:05:00.020
 and that's where the other characters take their importance 

00:05:00.020 --> 00:05:02.719
 they are used to feed murid and grow it 

00:05:02.719 --> 00:05:05.819
 and even more than that I was really surprised by some 

00:05:05.819 --> 00:05:09.209
 they certainly have little development nick a lot of changes 

00:05:10.199 --> 00:05:13.659
 otherwise if this manga is so effective it is not only thanks to 

00:05:13.659 --> 00:05:17.339
 scenarios but also by the drawings which conditions the general mood 

00:05:17.339 --> 00:05:20.979
 seven realism edges works of very precise and will recall very 

00:05:20.979 --> 00:05:23.659
 certainly the famous wanderer 

00:05:23.659 --> 00:05:26.459
 but the atmosphere sometimes Klopp is reminiscent of what happens when 

00:05:26.459 --> 00:05:28.999
 even something also intends to present kyoto 

00:05:28.999 --> 00:05:32.189
 in sum drawing it is typical of a signal 

00:05:32.189 --> 00:05:35.110
 we also note that the landscapes the mountains are beautifully well 

00:05:35.110 --> 00:05:39.769
 successful and realistic what city involves a lot of research the 

00:05:39.769 --> 00:05:43.049
 perspective is also a highlight of the mangaka that will no longer surprise a 

00:05:43.049 --> 00:05:43.990
 time 

00:05:43.990 --> 00:05:47.170
 despite being five years old it is technically subjectivity 

00:05:47.169 --> 00:05:49.979
 very good and I think a lot of you will agree with me that this 

00:05:49.979 --> 00:05:52.809
 that he showed a lot 

00:05:52.809 --> 00:05:56.839
 to conclude ascension is difficult to take because the majority will be reluctant 

00:05:56.839 --> 00:05:59.020
 in view of the background mountaineering 

00:05:59.020 --> 00:06:02.190
 but with this moment you have to know how to look beyond appearances and see 

00:06:02.190 --> 00:06:04.050
 what he is able to deliver us 

00:06:04.050 --> 00:06:06.309
 in my opinion there are two types of mandates 

00:06:06.309 --> 00:06:09.379
 the manga conditions take the lead and we appreciate despite the shortcomings 

00:06:09.379 --> 00:06:13.039
 and empty so gakunzi scriptwriting that calls for our reflection 

00:06:14.039 --> 00:06:16.589
 said like that it changes them quite right 

00:06:16.589 --> 00:06:19.749
 but what I know to say these cases are on the deck more be a sports manga 

00:06:19.749 --> 00:06:23.259
 denounces quite a few points the most critical way underlying sanofi the 

00:06:23.259 --> 00:06:25.309
 files without it being too heavy 

00:06:25.309 --> 00:06:28.550
 action and bagram are there to counterbalance the weight of 

00:06:28.549 --> 00:06:30.389
 different ideas evoked 

00:06:30.389 --> 00:06:34.069
 so in my opinion a little home because this manga is also able to satisfy 

00:06:34.069 --> 00:06:36.309
 the purists general public 

00:06:36.309 --> 00:06:39.609
 people will focus on the psychological aspects of the manga tone of what 

00:06:39.609 --> 00:06:42.400
 the other will appreciate the script side even bottomless 

00:06:42.400 --> 00:06:45.419
 the two are closely related 

00:06:45.419 --> 00:06:48.909
 so that's over for today I did not have a double shot so 

00:06:48.909 --> 00:06:51.740
 you appreciated that a small comment is even better 

00:06:51.740 --> 00:06:54.760
 otherwise I have a few months here at faecal thanks to all for your 

00:06:54.759 --> 00:06:57.119
 support and your understanding 

00:06:57.119 --> 00:07:00.379
 a lot of things happened yesterday she is what explains my delay for 

00:07:00.379 --> 00:07:01.599
 this episode 

00:07:01.599 --> 00:07:05.219
 I apologize so I do not absolutely abandon my channel 

00:07:05.219 --> 00:07:08.249
 account well share again and again with you my different shots of 

00:07:08.249 --> 00:07:08.810
 stone 

00:07:08.810 --> 00:07:11.710
 it's always better to appreciate the beggars are the senses as if I 

00:07:11.710 --> 00:07:13.389
 discover things 

00:07:13.389 --> 00:07:16.539
 thank you also to all the ranges to know who has unfortunately no 

00:07:16.539 --> 00:07:19.539
 youtube channel it will be necessary to go on him known only to hear singing 

00:07:20.430 --> 00:07:23.669
 otherwise I have some projects to improve the whole chain so 

00:07:23.669 --> 00:07:26.349
 to just re-starring this summer 

00:07:26.349 --> 00:07:29.409

00:07:29.409 --> 00:07:32.749
 were flying wide on this I wish you a good read and I you 

00:07:32.749 --> 00:07:35.509
 see you soon

00:07:37.449 --> 00:07:40.110
 you can not put us chamakh 

00:07:40.110 --> 00:07:40.960
 san jose north
