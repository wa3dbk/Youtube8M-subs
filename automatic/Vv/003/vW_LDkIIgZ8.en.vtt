00:03:54.600 --> 00:03:54.610 
pipe stacking to that slot feed them

00:03:54.610 --> 00:04:00.270 
pipe stacking to that slot feed them
through<00:03:56.970> now<00:03:57.970> the<00:03:58.360> radiator<00:03:58.900> guard<00:03:59.280> bracket

will push the that piece of faring out a

00:04:04.630 --> 00:04:07.080 
will push the that piece of faring out a
fraction<00:04:04.900> so<00:04:05.380> you<00:04:05.710> just<00:04:06.370> have<00:04:06.520> to<00:04:06.640> sit<00:04:06.820> it<00:04:06.970> in
