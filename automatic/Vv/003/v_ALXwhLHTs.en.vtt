00:04:10.420 --> 00:04:10.430 
their father so I think I don't know if

00:04:10.430 --> 00:04:11.830 
their father so I think I don't know if
it<00:04:10.519> moves<00:04:10.790> up<00:04:10.910> the<00:04:10.940> leaf<00:04:11.120> table<00:04:11.329> or<00:04:11.480> not<00:04:11.660> but

00:04:11.830 --> 00:04:11.840 
it moves up the leaf table or not but

00:04:11.840 --> 00:04:13.120 
it moves up the leaf table or not but
that's<00:04:12.079> what<00:04:12.290> we<00:04:12.380> tried<00:04:12.530> to<00:04:12.620> concentrate<00:04:12.920> on

00:04:13.120 --> 00:04:13.130 
that's what we tried to concentrate on

00:04:13.130 --> 00:04:14.949 
that's what we tried to concentrate on
the<00:04:13.250> positives<00:04:13.670> rather<00:04:13.880> I'm<00:04:14.060> thinking<00:04:14.450> if<00:04:14.660> we

00:04:14.949 --> 00:04:14.959 
the positives rather I'm thinking if we

00:04:14.959 --> 00:04:17.469 
the positives rather I'm thinking if we
lose<00:04:15.170> this<00:04:15.200> will<00:04:16.010> end<00:04:16.220> the<00:04:16.310> delegations<00:04:16.820> on<00:04:16.970> a

00:04:17.469 --> 00:04:17.479 
lose this will end the delegations on a

00:04:17.479 --> 00:04:20.110 
lose this will end the delegations on a
lot<00:04:17.989> of<00:04:18.049> pressure<00:04:18.260> on<00:04:18.380> but<00:04:18.650> I<00:04:18.680> think<00:04:19.340> you<00:04:20.030> know

00:04:20.110 --> 00:04:20.120 
lot of pressure on but I think you know

00:04:20.120 --> 00:04:21.879 
lot of pressure on but I think you know
what<00:04:20.419> students<00:04:20.780> it<00:04:20.989> was<00:04:21.109> a<00:04:21.139> tough<00:04:21.530> ask<00:04:21.739> for

00:04:21.879 --> 00:04:21.889 
what students it was a tough ask for

00:04:21.889 --> 00:04:23.440 
what students it was a tough ask for
them<00:04:22.010> and<00:04:22.130> come<00:04:22.250> to<00:04:22.370> a<00:04:22.400> sec<00:04:22.700> okay<00:04:23.120> the<00:04:23.360> other

00:04:23.440 --> 00:04:23.450 
them and come to a sec okay the other

00:04:23.450 --> 00:04:26.800 
them and come to a sec okay the other
obviously<00:04:24.139> belongs<00:04:24.470> in<00:04:24.590> the<00:04:24.680> league<00:04:24.860> so<00:04:25.810> it's

00:04:26.800 --> 00:04:26.810 
obviously belongs in the league so it's

00:04:26.810 --> 00:04:28.270 
obviously belongs in the league so it's
good<00:04:26.930> to<00:04:26.960> be<00:04:27.050> half<00:04:27.200> the<00:04:27.229> both<00:04:27.530> sides<00:04:27.800> bit<00:04:28.070> you

00:04:28.270 --> 00:04:28.280 
good to be half the both sides bit you

00:04:28.280 --> 00:04:29.800 
good to be half the both sides bit you
know<00:04:28.310> I<00:04:28.430> think<00:04:28.580> we<00:04:28.820> find<00:04:29.300> that<00:04:29.419> really<00:04:29.690> where
