00:03:12.460 --> 00:03:12.470 
hopefully I don't do the same for that

00:03:12.470 --> 00:03:17.380 
hopefully I don't do the same for that

00:03:17.380 --> 00:03:17.390 
one so here's our AC adapter just open

00:03:17.390 --> 00:03:22.600 
one so here's our AC adapter just open
it<00:03:17.690> up<00:03:17.870> and<00:03:19.930> you'll<00:03:20.930> notice<00:03:21.200> how<00:03:22.070> small<00:03:22.549> that

it up and you'll notice how small that

00:03:22.610 --> 00:03:28.390 
it up and you'll notice how small that
is<00:03:25.390> let's<00:03:26.390> get<00:03:26.510> the<00:03:26.630> stock<00:03:27.130> little<00:03:28.130> bit

00:03:28.390 --> 00:03:28.400 
is let's get the stock little bit

00:03:28.400 --> 00:03:31.300 
is let's get the stock little bit
whatever<00:03:29.299> I<00:03:29.510> think<00:03:29.810> I<00:03:30.049> think<00:03:30.739> it's<00:03:30.890> a<00:03:31.010> three

00:03:31.300 --> 00:03:31.310 
whatever I think I think it's a three

00:03:31.310 --> 00:03:34.600 
whatever I think I think it's a three
foot<00:03:31.519> long<00:03:31.579> cord<00:03:32.450> so<00:03:33.380> we<00:03:33.500> have<00:03:33.650> two<00:03:34.310> parts

00:03:34.600 --> 00:03:34.610 
foot long cord so we have two parts

00:03:34.610 --> 00:03:36.580 
foot long cord so we have two parts
actually<00:03:34.820> we<00:03:35.180> have<00:03:35.390> the<00:03:35.900> part<00:03:36.140> that<00:03:36.320> connects

00:03:36.580 --> 00:03:36.590 
actually we have the part that connects

00:03:36.590 --> 00:03:38.920 
actually we have the part that connects
to<00:03:36.709> the<00:03:36.860> surface<00:03:37.100> which<00:03:37.610> is<00:03:37.640> this<00:03:38.630> right<00:03:38.900> here

00:03:38.920 --> 00:03:38.930 
to the surface which is this right here

00:03:38.930 --> 00:03:41.069 
to the surface which is this right here
and<00:03:39.560> it's<00:03:39.739> a<00:03:39.860> slimmer<00:03:40.160> design<00:03:40.400> it's<00:03:40.880> also

00:03:41.069 --> 00:03:41.079 
and it's a slimmer design it's also

00:03:41.079 --> 00:03:43.509 
and it's a slimmer design it's also
angled<00:03:42.079> in<00:03:42.260> a<00:03:42.320> way<00:03:42.440> that<00:03:42.680> it<00:03:42.769> might<00:03:42.980> not<00:03:43.130> slip

00:03:43.509 --> 00:03:43.519 
angled in a way that it might not slip

00:03:43.519 --> 00:03:45.400 
angled in a way that it might not slip
out<00:03:43.670> as<00:03:43.880> easily<00:03:44.120> as<00:03:44.420> the<00:03:44.600> previous<00:03:44.810> versions

00:03:45.400 --> 00:03:45.410 
out as easily as the previous versions

00:03:45.410 --> 00:03:51.729 
out as easily as the previous versions
and<00:03:45.620> then<00:03:46.459> sort<00:03:47.209> of<00:03:47.329> like<00:03:47.510> a<00:03:48.880> plug<00:03:49.880> to<00:03:50.739> the

00:03:51.729 --> 00:03:51.739 
and then sort of like a plug to the

00:03:51.739 --> 00:03:56.979 
and then sort of like a plug to the
adapter<00:03:53.950> this<00:03:54.950> one's<00:03:55.220> only<00:03:55.430> about<00:03:55.700> foot<00:03:56.180> maybe

00:03:56.979 --> 00:03:56.989 
adapter this one's only about foot maybe

00:03:56.989 --> 00:04:00.729 
adapter this one's only about foot maybe
a<00:03:57.110> little<00:03:57.260> bit<00:03:57.470> more<00:03:57.590> long<00:03:58.150> so<00:03:59.350> yeah<00:04:00.350> nice

00:05:29.600 --> 00:05:32.680 
magnetic clips and look at how easy that
clicked<00:05:29.840> on<00:05:29.960> one<00:05:30.170> thing<00:05:30.350> that<00:05:31.280> I<00:05:31.820> was

00:05:32.680 --> 00:05:32.690 
clicked on one thing that I was

00:05:32.690 --> 00:05:36.820 
clicked on one thing that I was
interested<00:05:32.900> about<00:05:33.470> was<00:05:33.890> the<00:05:35.170> the<00:05:36.170> angle<00:05:36.650> and

00:05:36.820 --> 00:05:36.830 
interested about was the the angle and

00:05:36.830 --> 00:05:42.370 
interested about was the the angle and
how<00:05:37.160> it<00:05:37.310> clicks<00:05:37.610> up<00:05:38.290> so<00:05:40.600> we<00:05:41.600> shut<00:05:41.930> it<00:05:41.960> all<00:05:42.320> the

00:05:42.370 --> 00:05:42.380 
how it clicks up so we shut it all the

00:05:42.380 --> 00:05:47.200 
how it clicks up so we shut it all the
way<00:05:43.300> this<00:05:44.300> is<00:05:44.360> what<00:05:44.690> you're<00:05:44.840> looking<00:05:45.170> at<00:05:46.210> you

00:05:47.200 --> 00:05:47.210 
way this is what you're looking at you

00:05:47.210 --> 00:05:52.810 
way this is what you're looking at you
know<00:05:47.360> um<00:05:47.870> i<00:05:48.250> would<00:05:49.250> say<00:05:49.810> lighter<00:05:50.810> than<00:05:51.820> your

00:05:52.810 --> 00:05:52.820 
know um i would say lighter than your

00:05:52.820 --> 00:05:57.220 
know um i would say lighter than your
average<00:05:53.440> notebook<00:05:55.210> heavy<00:05:56.210> for<00:05:56.540> a<00:05:56.570> tablet<00:05:56.810> but

00:05:57.220 --> 00:05:57.230 
average notebook heavy for a tablet but

00:05:57.230 --> 00:05:58.750 
average notebook heavy for a tablet but
then<00:05:57.410> again<00:05:57.500> this<00:05:57.770> isn't<00:05:57.980> a<00:05:58.130> tablet<00:05:58.520> it's<00:05:58.700> a

00:05:58.750 --> 00:05:58.760 
then again this isn't a tablet it's a

00:05:58.760 --> 00:06:01.290 
then again this isn't a tablet it's a
full-blown<00:05:59.120> computer<00:05:59.930> so<00:06:00.440> this<00:06:00.680> was<00:06:00.890> my

00:06:01.290 --> 00:06:01.300 
full-blown computer so this was my
