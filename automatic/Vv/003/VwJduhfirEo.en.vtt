designed to go with a sub mount system
this<00:01:03.690> is<00:01:03.840> working<00:01:04.170> out<00:01:04.260> pretty<00:01:04.650> well<00:01:04.769> I<00:01:04.920> don't

00:01:05.240 --> 00:01:05.250

have a stabilizer on here for because

00:01:07.200 --> 00:01:09.469 
have a stabilizer on here for because
for<00:01:08.010> most<00:01:08.220> of<00:01:08.340> our<00:01:08.400> trail<00:01:08.670> riding<00:01:08.909> we<00:01:09.090> really

00:01:09.469 --> 00:01:09.479 
for most of our trail riding we really

00:01:09.479 --> 00:01:12.170 
for most of our trail riding we really
just<00:01:09.720> don't<00:01:10.049> need<00:01:10.290> it<00:01:10.700> you<00:01:11.700> can<00:01:11.909> see<00:01:12.060> I'm

00:01:12.170 --> 00:01:12.180 
just don't need it you can see I'm

00:01:12.180 --> 00:01:15.070 
just don't need it you can see I'm
running<00:01:12.330> the<00:01:12.630> blue<00:01:12.990> the<00:01:13.860> leverage<00:01:14.460> ratios

00:01:15.070 --> 00:01:15.080 
running the blue the leverage ratios

00:01:15.080 --> 00:01:17.359 
running the blue the leverage ratios
everything's<00:01:16.080> just<00:01:16.320> a<00:01:16.409> little<00:01:16.439> bit<00:01:16.979> different

00:01:17.359 --> 00:01:17.369 
everything's just a little bit different

00:01:17.369 --> 00:01:19.100 
everything's just a little bit different
on<00:01:17.460> the<00:01:17.580> way<00:01:17.670> this<00:01:17.850> low<00:01:18.119> bar<00:01:18.360> is<00:01:18.479> constructed

00:01:19.100 --> 00:01:19.110 
on the way this low bar is constructed

00:01:19.110 --> 00:01:20.810 
on the way this low bar is constructed
so<00:01:19.140> the<00:01:19.500> blue<00:01:19.710> actually<00:01:20.009> seems<00:01:20.369> to<00:01:20.520> work<00:01:20.670> out

00:01:20.810 --> 00:01:20.820 
so the blue actually seems to work out

00:01:20.820 --> 00:01:25.070

00:01:55.670 --> 00:01:55.680 
are proving just to be super durable

00:01:55.680 --> 00:01:58.010 
are proving just to be super durable
it's<00:01:56.250> really<00:01:56.729> lightweight<00:01:56.969> just<00:01:57.570> put<00:01:57.780> on<00:01:57.930> the

it's really lightweight just put on the

the the KTM power parts skid plate
that's<00:02:06.540> working<00:02:06.899> out<00:02:07.020> just<00:02:07.049> fine<00:02:07.320> would<00:02:08.310> be

00:02:08.419 --> 00:02:08.429 
that's working out just fine would be

00:02:08.429 --> 00:02:09.919 
that's working out just fine would be
nice<00:02:08.610> if<00:02:08.789> it<00:02:08.879> had<00:02:08.910> a<00:02:09.030> little<00:02:09.300> higher<00:02:09.450> coverage

00:02:09.919 --> 00:02:09.929 
nice if it had a little higher coverage

00:02:09.929 --> 00:02:11.930 
nice if it had a little higher coverage
but<00:02:10.289> as<00:02:10.530> you<00:02:10.739> can<00:02:10.860> see<00:02:10.920> it's<00:02:11.250> actually<00:02:11.400> protect

00:02:11.930 --> 00:02:11.940 
but as you can see it's actually protect

00:02:11.940 --> 00:02:13.280 
but as you can see it's actually protect
their<00:02:12.090> bike<00:02:12.300> pretty<00:02:12.690> well

00:02:13.280 --> 00:02:13.290 
their bike pretty well

00:02:13.290 --> 00:02:15.259 
their bike pretty well
some<00:02:14.069> new<00:02:14.189> foot<00:02:14.430> pegs<00:02:14.640> down<00:02:14.879> there<00:02:15.120> we're

00:02:15.259 --> 00:02:15.269 
some new foot pegs down there we're

00:02:15.269 --> 00:02:16.820 
some new foot pegs down there we're
testing<00:02:15.780> I'm<00:02:15.930> not<00:02:16.080> sure<00:02:16.230> if<00:02:16.349> I<00:02:16.409> can<00:02:16.470> actually

00:02:16.820 --> 00:02:16.830 
testing I'm not sure if I can actually

00:02:16.830 --> 00:02:20.240 
testing I'm not sure if I can actually
talk<00:02:16.980> about<00:02:17.310> those<00:02:17.549> yet<00:02:18.379> getting<00:02:19.379> ready<00:02:19.799> to<00:02:20.069> go

00:02:20.240 --> 00:02:20.250 
talk about those yet getting ready to go

00:02:20.250 --> 00:02:21.860 
talk about those yet getting ready to go
out<00:02:20.340> and<00:02:20.489> test<00:02:20.700> the<00:02:20.849> new<00:02:20.970> Washougal<00:02:21.569> -<00:02:21.840> I

00:02:21.860 --> 00:02:21.870 
out and test the new Washougal - I

00:02:21.870 --> 00:02:25.429 
out and test the new Washougal - I
haven't<00:02:22.290> used<00:02:22.650> that<00:02:22.799> yet<00:02:23.370> but<00:02:24.230> we'll<00:02:25.230> see<00:02:25.409> how

00:02:25.429 --> 00:02:25.439 
haven't used that yet but we'll see how

00:02:25.439 --> 00:02:27.289 
haven't used that yet but we'll see how
that<00:02:25.709> goes<00:02:25.920> we've<00:02:26.159> got<00:02:26.340> some<00:02:26.489> great<00:02:26.939> weather

00:02:27.289 --> 00:02:27.299 
that goes we've got some great weather

00:02:27.299 --> 00:02:29.059 
that goes we've got some great weather
conditions<00:02:27.870> with<00:02:28.079> the<00:02:28.200> recent<00:02:28.530> rain<00:02:28.680> so<00:02:28.920> I'm

00:02:29.059 --> 00:02:29.069 
conditions with the recent rain so I'm

00:02:29.069 --> 00:02:30.289 
conditions with the recent rain so I'm
really<00:02:29.430> anxious<00:02:29.579> to<00:02:29.819> see<00:02:29.909> how<00:02:30.000> that<00:02:30.150> one

00:02:30.289 --> 00:02:30.299 
really anxious to see how that one

00:02:30.299 --> 00:02:31.220 
really anxious to see how that one
seagull<00:02:30.629> feels

00:02:31.220 --> 00:02:31.230 
seagull feels

00:02:31.230 --> 00:02:33.140 
seagull feels
getting<00:02:31.829> ready<00:02:31.950> for<00:02:31.980> a<00:02:32.129> Baja<00:02:32.489> trip<00:02:32.760> here<00:02:32.970> so

00:02:33.140 --> 00:02:33.150 
getting ready for a Baja trip here so

00:02:33.150 --> 00:02:34.460 
getting ready for a Baja trip here so
that's<00:02:33.329> why<00:02:33.450> I've<00:02:33.569> got<00:02:33.720> the<00:02:33.840> bags<00:02:34.049> on<00:02:34.319> they

00:02:34.460 --> 00:02:34.470 
that's why I've got the bags on they

00:02:34.470 --> 00:02:37.520 
that's why I've got the bags on they
pretty<00:02:34.709> much<00:02:35.360> they<00:02:36.360> pretty<00:02:36.569> much<00:02:36.750> never<00:02:37.140> come

00:02:37.520 --> 00:02:37.530 
pretty much they pretty much never come

00:02:37.530 --> 00:02:40.309 
pretty much they pretty much never come
off<00:02:37.739> the<00:02:37.950> bike<00:02:38.099> the<00:02:38.370> giant<00:02:38.730> loot<00:02:38.879> bags<00:02:39.150> I<00:02:39.569> have

00:02:40.309 --> 00:02:40.319 
off the bike the giant loot bags I have

00:02:40.319 --> 00:02:43.160 
off the bike the giant loot bags I have
changed<00:02:40.890> around<00:02:41.010> my<00:02:41.489> mountain<00:02:42.060> just<00:02:42.659> a<00:02:42.780> little

00:02:43.160 --> 00:02:43.170 
changed around my mountain just a little

00:02:43.170 --> 00:02:46.069 
changed around my mountain just a little
bit<00:02:44.030> when<00:02:45.030> I'm<00:02:45.150> setting<00:02:45.450> up<00:02:45.480> the<00:02:45.629> giant<00:02:45.959> loot

00:02:46.069 --> 00:02:46.079 
bit when I'm setting up the giant loot

00:02:46.079 --> 00:02:48.319 
bit when I'm setting up the giant loot
bags<00:02:46.319> what<00:02:46.620> I<00:02:46.650> do<00:02:46.769> is<00:02:47.010> I<00:02:47.129> just<00:02:47.159> take<00:02:47.579> and<00:02:48.060> tuck

00:02:48.319 --> 00:02:48.329 
bags what I do is I just take and tuck

00:02:48.329 --> 00:02:49.910 
bags what I do is I just take and tuck
them<00:02:48.450> right<00:02:48.690> under<00:02:48.989> the<00:02:49.079> seat<00:02:49.349> right<00:02:49.500> there<00:02:49.620> in

00:02:49.910 --> 00:02:49.920 
them right under the seat right there in

00:02:49.920 --> 00:02:52.369 
them right under the seat right there in
this<00:02:50.099> side<00:02:50.310> that<00:02:50.519> pretty<00:02:50.940> much<00:02:51.170> creates<00:02:52.170> the

00:02:52.369 --> 00:02:52.379 
this side that pretty much creates the

00:02:52.379 --> 00:02:55.309 
this side that pretty much creates the
position<00:02:52.889> for<00:02:53.129> them<00:02:53.340> and<00:02:53.989> then<00:02:54.989> what<00:02:55.200> I've

00:02:55.309 --> 00:02:55.319 
position for them and then what I've

00:02:55.319 --> 00:02:56.990 
position for them and then what I've
decided<00:02:55.709> to<00:02:55.980> keep<00:02:56.129> them<00:02:56.340> from<00:02:56.549> migrating

00:02:56.990 --> 00:02:57.000 
decided to keep them from migrating

00:02:57.000 --> 00:02:59.599 
decided to keep them from migrating
forward<00:02:57.690> is<00:02:57.870> I<00:02:58.230> run<00:02:58.440> a<00:02:58.470> bolt<00:02:58.829> right<00:02:59.340> through

00:02:59.599 --> 00:02:59.609 
forward is I run a bolt right through

00:02:59.609 --> 00:03:02.599 
forward is I run a bolt right through
the<00:02:59.730> bottom<00:02:59.940> there<00:03:00.389> and<00:03:00.950> to<00:03:01.950> the<00:03:02.069> underside<00:03:02.579> of

00:03:02.599 --> 00:03:02.609 
the bottom there and to the underside of

00:03:02.609 --> 00:03:04.819 
the bottom there and to the underside of
the<00:03:02.730> fender<00:03:03.120> it<00:03:03.239> takes<00:03:03.480> almost<00:03:03.810> no<00:03:04.079> tension

00:03:04.819 --> 00:03:04.829 
the fender it takes almost no tension

00:03:04.829 --> 00:03:07.339 
the fender it takes almost no tension
just<00:03:05.010> drill<00:03:05.970> that<00:03:06.150> put<00:03:06.569> a<00:03:06.599> little<00:03:07.139> bolt

00:03:07.339 --> 00:03:07.349 
just drill that put a little bolt

00:03:07.349 --> 00:03:08.360 
just drill that put a little bolt
through<00:03:07.560> there<00:03:07.709> and<00:03:07.799> that<00:03:07.920> holds<00:03:08.250> those

00:03:08.360 --> 00:03:08.370 
through there and that holds those

00:03:08.370 --> 00:03:10.819 
through there and that holds those
perfectly<00:03:09.060> in<00:03:09.299> place<00:03:09.450> of<00:03:10.260> course<00:03:10.470> this<00:03:10.650> side

00:03:10.819 --> 00:03:10.829 
perfectly in place of course this side

00:03:10.829 --> 00:03:15.170 
perfectly in place of course this side
we<00:03:11.040> loop<00:03:11.220> to<00:03:11.400> the<00:03:11.519> frame<00:03:12.139> on<00:03:13.280> this<00:03:14.280> bike<00:03:14.670> the

00:03:15.170 --> 00:03:15.180 
we loop to the frame on this bike the

00:03:15.180 --> 00:03:17.720 
we loop to the frame on this bike the
loop<00:03:15.389> on<00:03:15.599> this<00:03:15.780> side<00:03:16.049> actually<00:03:16.470> it<00:03:17.040> works<00:03:17.519> out

00:03:17.720 --> 00:03:17.730 
loop on this side actually it works out

00:03:17.730 --> 00:03:21.439 
loop on this side actually it works out
really<00:03:17.910> well<00:03:18.030> -<00:03:18.329> now<00:03:18.959> on<00:03:19.169> my<00:03:19.349> RFS<00:03:19.919> bikes<00:03:20.419> when<00:03:21.419> I

00:03:21.439 --> 00:03:21.449 
really well - now on my RFS bikes when I

00:03:21.449 --> 00:03:23.659 
really well - now on my RFS bikes when I
do<00:03:21.599> that<00:03:21.959> it<00:03:22.199> puts<00:03:22.500> it<00:03:22.620> a<00:03:22.739> little<00:03:23.010> close<00:03:23.400> to<00:03:23.639> the

00:03:23.659 --> 00:03:23.669 
do that it puts it a little close to the

00:03:23.669 --> 00:03:25.309 
do that it puts it a little close to the
exhaust<00:03:24.150> so<00:03:24.419> I've<00:03:24.510> actually<00:03:24.660> zip<00:03:25.049> tied<00:03:25.290> a

00:03:25.309 --> 00:03:25.319 
exhaust so I've actually zip tied a

00:03:25.319 --> 00:03:29.180 
exhaust so I've actually zip tied a
d-ring<00:03:25.819> in<00:03:26.819> place<00:03:27.269> on<00:03:27.870> the<00:03:28.319> RFS<00:03:28.709> bike<00:03:28.919> or<00:03:29.129> a

00:03:29.180 --> 00:03:29.190 
d-ring in place on the RFS bike or a

00:03:29.190 --> 00:03:31.520 
d-ring in place on the RFS bike or a
about<00:03:29.430> here<00:03:29.940> to<00:03:30.480> run<00:03:30.660> that<00:03:30.780> loop<00:03:30.989> through<00:03:31.230> and

00:03:31.520 --> 00:03:31.530 
about here to run that loop through and

00:03:31.530 --> 00:03:33.379 
about here to run that loop through and
that's<00:03:32.250> been<00:03:32.459> working<00:03:32.639> out<00:03:32.819> really<00:03:32.970> well<00:03:33.090> to

00:03:33.379 --> 00:03:33.389 
that's been working out really well to

00:03:33.389 --> 00:03:40.160 
that's been working out really well to
keep<00:03:33.569> them<00:03:33.750> for<00:03:34.019> me<00:03:34.139> on<00:03:34.290> the<00:03:34.620> exhaust

00:03:40.160 --> 00:03:40.170 

00:03:40.170 --> 00:03:42.830 

like<00:03:40.770> really<00:03:41.100> racked<00:03:41.550> up<00:03:41.760> a<00:03:41.910> lot<00:03:41.940> of<00:03:42.240> miles<00:03:42.450> and

00:03:42.830 --> 00:03:42.840 
like really racked up a lot of miles and

00:03:42.840 --> 00:03:45.350 
like really racked up a lot of miles and
I<00:03:43.020> have<00:03:43.500> to<00:03:43.680> confess<00:03:44.040> I<00:03:44.250> really<00:03:44.730> don't<00:03:45.090> pay

00:03:45.350 --> 00:03:45.360 
I have to confess I really don't pay

00:03:45.360 --> 00:03:46.910 
I have to confess I really don't pay
much<00:03:45.570> attention<00:03:45.600> to<00:03:46.110> it<00:03:46.380> I<00:03:46.560> have<00:03:46.680> a<00:03:46.710> whole

00:03:46.910 --> 00:03:46.920 
much attention to it I have a whole

00:03:46.920 --> 00:03:48.500 
much attention to it I have a whole
garage<00:03:47.130> full<00:03:47.280> of<00:03:47.550> motorcycles<00:03:48.180> I<00:03:48.270> have<00:03:48.390> to

00:03:48.500 --> 00:03:48.510 
garage full of motorcycles I have to

00:03:48.510 --> 00:03:50.450 
garage full of motorcycles I have to
prep<00:03:48.840> for<00:03:48.870> the<00:03:49.230> average<00:03:49.380> ride<00:03:49.830> so<00:03:50.160> they<00:03:50.310> get

00:03:50.450 --> 00:03:50.460 
prep for the average ride so they get

00:03:50.460 --> 00:03:53.300 
prep for the average ride so they get
most<00:03:50.760> of<00:03:50.940> the<00:03:51.030> time<00:03:51.380> often<00:03:52.380> I<00:03:52.770> come<00:03:52.950> around<00:03:53.160> to

00:03:53.300 --> 00:03:53.310 
most of the time often I come around to

00:03:53.310 --> 00:03:54.710 
most of the time often I come around to
looking<00:03:53.550> at<00:03:53.640> this<00:03:53.760> bike<00:03:54.030> that<00:03:54.240> I'm<00:03:54.300> gonna<00:03:54.450> ride

00:03:54.710 --> 00:03:54.720 
looking at this bike that I'm gonna ride

00:03:54.720 --> 00:03:56.900 
looking at this bike that I'm gonna ride
and<00:03:54.930> say<00:03:55.080> well<00:03:55.320> you<00:03:55.980> don't<00:03:56.160> want<00:03:56.310> that<00:03:56.460> oil<00:03:56.670> and

00:03:56.900 --> 00:03:56.910 
and say well you don't want that oil and

00:03:56.910 --> 00:03:58.940 
and say well you don't want that oil and
that<00:03:57.030> air<00:03:57.210> filter<00:03:57.600> I<00:03:57.810> didn't<00:03:58.260> use<00:03:58.410> a<00:03:58.440> very<00:03:58.740> hard

00:03:58.940 --> 00:03:58.950 
that air filter I didn't use a very hard

00:03:58.950 --> 00:04:00.320 
that air filter I didn't use a very hard
last<00:03:59.100> week<00:03:59.280> you'll<00:03:59.490> probably<00:03:59.700> be<00:03:59.970> good<00:04:00.120> for

00:04:00.320 --> 00:04:00.330 
last week you'll probably be good for

last week you'll probably be good for
another<00:04:00.510> week<00:04:00.810> I<00:04:01.220> really<00:04:02.220> I<00:04:02.430> just<00:04:02.970> ride<00:04:03.150> it

00:04:03.320 --> 00:04:03.330 
another week I really I just ride it

00:04:03.330 --> 00:04:06.260 
another week I really I just ride it
just<00:04:03.360> put<00:04:03.720> gas<00:04:03.900> in<00:04:04.140> it<00:04:04.230> and<00:04:04.380> go<00:04:04.640> the<00:04:05.640> 13<00:04:06.060> litre

00:04:06.260 --> 00:04:06.270 
just put gas in it and go the 13 litre

00:04:06.270 --> 00:04:08.750 
just put gas in it and go the 13 litre
tank<00:04:06.570> there<00:04:06.900> pretty<00:04:07.770> consistently<00:04:08.459> for

00:04:08.750 --> 00:04:08.760 
tank there pretty consistently for

develop<00:04:30.150> on<00:04:30.240> this<00:04:30.390> bike<00:04:30.630> as<00:04:30.870> the<00:04:31.260> mileage<00:04:31.680> went

00:04:31.940 --> 00:04:31.950 
develop on this bike as the mileage went

00:04:31.950 --> 00:04:34.970 
develop on this bike as the mileage went
up<00:04:32.100> one<00:04:32.669> is<00:04:32.910> it<00:04:33.600> started<00:04:34.380> to<00:04:34.440> gain<00:04:34.560> some<00:04:34.830> real

00:04:34.970 --> 00:04:34.980 
up one is it started to gain some real

00:04:34.980 --> 00:04:36.860 
up one is it started to gain some real
vibration<00:04:35.730> and<00:04:35.970> it<00:04:36.360> became<00:04:36.630> pretty

00:04:36.860 --> 00:04:36.870 
vibration and it became pretty

00:04:36.870 --> 00:04:40.100 
vibration and it became pretty
pronounced<00:04:37.500> the<00:04:38.100> second<00:04:38.460> was<00:04:38.640> we<00:04:39.540> had<00:04:39.720> a<00:04:39.750> low

00:04:40.100 --> 00:04:40.110 
pronounced the second was we had a low

00:04:40.110 --> 00:04:43.040 
pronounced the second was we had a low
speed<00:04:40.740> like<00:04:41.490> flameout<00:04:42.210> stall<00:04:42.600> that<00:04:42.840> would

00:04:43.040 --> 00:04:43.050 
speed like flameout stall that would

00:04:43.050 --> 00:04:45.770 
speed like flameout stall that would
happen<00:04:43.470> fairly<00:04:43.980> often<00:04:44.190> at<00:04:45.000> a<00:04:45.300> hundred<00:04:45.600> and

00:04:45.770 --> 00:04:45.780 
happen fairly often at a hundred and

00:04:45.780 --> 00:04:47.510 
happen fairly often at a hundred and
forty<00:04:46.140> hours<00:04:46.169> I<00:04:46.530> took<00:04:46.680> the<00:04:46.770> bike<00:04:46.919> in<00:04:47.100> to<00:04:47.190> KTM

00:04:47.510 --> 00:04:47.520 
forty hours I took the bike in to KTM

00:04:47.520 --> 00:04:49.790 
forty hours I took the bike in to KTM
they<00:04:47.790> did<00:04:47.940> a<00:04:47.970> complete<00:04:48.300> service<00:04:48.570> for<00:04:48.900> me<00:04:49.050> the

00:04:49.790 --> 00:04:49.800 
they did a complete service for me the

00:04:49.800 --> 00:04:52.400 
they did a complete service for me the
vibration<00:04:50.430> they<00:04:51.419> already<00:04:51.720> knew<00:04:52.020> what<00:04:52.229> to<00:04:52.380> look

00:04:52.400 --> 00:04:52.410 
vibration they already knew what to look

00:04:52.410 --> 00:04:55.580 
vibration they already knew what to look
for<00:04:52.860> that<00:04:53.100> was<00:04:53.310> the<00:04:53.760> the<00:04:54.390> clutch<00:04:54.720> rubbers<00:04:55.380> were

00:04:55.580 --> 00:04:55.590 
for that was the the clutch rubbers were

00:04:55.590 --> 00:04:58.159 
for that was the the clutch rubbers were
worn<00:04:55.890> out<00:04:56.010> pretty<00:04:56.430> common<00:04:56.820> on<00:04:56.880> KTMs<00:04:57.570> they

00:04:58.159 --> 00:04:58.169 
worn out pretty common on KTMs they

00:04:58.169 --> 00:05:01.010 
worn out pretty common on KTMs they
should<00:04:58.500> be<00:04:58.680> replaced<00:04:58.979> on<00:04:59.570> trail<00:05:00.570> ride<00:05:00.810> bikes

00:05:01.010 --> 00:05:01.020 
should be replaced on trail ride bikes

00:05:01.020 --> 00:05:03.590 
should be replaced on trail ride bikes
probably<00:05:01.560> at<00:05:01.650> 80<00:05:01.919> to<00:05:02.070> a<00:05:02.310> hundred<00:05:02.370> hours<00:05:03.000> with

00:05:03.590 --> 00:05:03.600 
probably at 80 to a hundred hours with

00:05:03.600 --> 00:05:05.690 
probably at 80 to a hundred hours with
those<00:05:03.810> replaced<00:05:04.229> the<00:05:04.410> vibration<00:05:04.919> went<00:05:05.400> right

00:05:05.690 --> 00:05:05.700 
those replaced the vibration went right

00:05:05.700 --> 00:05:09.080 
those replaced the vibration went right
away<00:05:06.050> and<00:05:07.050> they<00:05:07.770> cleaned<00:05:08.070> the<00:05:08.190> fuel<00:05:08.460> injector

00:05:09.080 --> 00:05:09.090 
away and they cleaned the fuel injector

00:05:09.090 --> 00:05:12.260 
away and they cleaned the fuel injector
pulled<00:05:09.870> it<00:05:10.050> did<00:05:10.530> a<00:05:10.560> simple<00:05:11.010> clean<00:05:11.250> on<00:05:11.460> it<00:05:11.669> put

00:05:12.260 --> 00:05:12.270 
pulled it did a simple clean on it put

00:05:12.270 --> 00:05:14.570 
pulled it did a simple clean on it put
it<00:05:12.390> back<00:05:12.419> together<00:05:13.040> ran<00:05:14.040> the<00:05:14.160> bike<00:05:14.310> through

00:05:14.570 --> 00:05:14.580 
it back together ran the bike through

00:05:14.580 --> 00:05:16.820 
it back together ran the bike through
the<00:05:14.700> diagnostic<00:05:14.910> on<00:05:15.540> that<00:05:15.720> computer<00:05:16.260> to<00:05:16.680> look

00:05:16.820 --> 00:05:16.830 
the diagnostic on that computer to look

00:05:16.830 --> 00:05:20.480 
the diagnostic on that computer to look
at<00:05:17.010> all<00:05:17.250> the<00:05:17.460> mapping<00:05:17.910> and<00:05:18.830> that<00:05:19.830> cured<00:05:20.250> the

00:05:20.480 --> 00:05:20.490 
at all the mapping and that cured the

00:05:20.490 --> 00:05:22.640 
at all the mapping and that cured the
stall<00:05:20.760> issue<00:05:20.970> we<00:05:21.240> were<00:05:21.390> having<00:05:21.660> also<00:05:21.810> don't

00:05:22.640 --> 00:05:22.650 
stall issue we were having also don't

00:05:22.650 --> 00:05:24.710 
stall issue we were having also don't
know<00:05:22.800> exactly<00:05:23.490> what<00:05:23.729> was<00:05:23.850> causing<00:05:24.300> it<00:05:24.360> because

00:05:24.710 --> 00:05:24.720 
know exactly what was causing it because

00:05:24.720 --> 00:05:27.350 
know exactly what was causing it because
they<00:05:25.560> said<00:05:26.100> the<00:05:26.310> injector<00:05:26.729> looked<00:05:27.030> like<00:05:27.210> it

00:05:27.350 --> 00:05:27.360 
they said the injector looked like it

00:05:27.360 --> 00:05:30.500 
they said the injector looked like it
was<00:05:27.479> clean<00:05:27.750> but<00:05:28.620> uh<00:05:28.680> but<00:05:29.580> whatever<00:05:29.880> it<00:05:30.000> is<00:05:30.090> once

00:05:30.500 --> 00:05:30.510 
was clean but uh but whatever it is once

00:05:30.510 --> 00:05:32.090 
was clean but uh but whatever it is once
we<00:05:30.630> got<00:05:30.750> back<00:05:31.020> that<00:05:31.260> was<00:05:31.380> that<00:05:31.650> was<00:05:31.770> totally

00:05:32.090 --> 00:05:32.100 
we got back that was that was totally
