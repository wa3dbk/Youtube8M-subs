00:00:53.930 --> 00:00:53.940 
the watch is now in winding mode now you

00:00:53.940 --> 00:00:59.920 
the watch is now in winding mode now you
need<00:00:54.120> to<00:00:54.440> wind<00:00:55.440> forwards<00:00:58.640> approximately

00:00:59.920 --> 00:00:59.930 
need to wind forwards approximately

00:00:59.930 --> 00:01:03.650 
need to wind forwards approximately
eighteen<00:01:00.930> or<00:01:01.079> nineteen<00:01:01.109> times<00:01:02.300> you<00:01:03.300> can<00:01:03.449> feel

00:01:03.650 --> 00:01:03.660 
eighteen or nineteen times you can feel

00:01:03.660 --> 00:01:06.740 
eighteen or nineteen times you can feel
the<00:01:03.870> winder<00:01:04.769> slightly<00:01:05.159> recoil<00:01:05.700> against<00:01:06.630> the

00:01:06.740 --> 00:01:06.750 
the winder slightly recoil against the

00:01:06.750 --> 00:01:09.649 
the winder slightly recoil against the
spring<00:01:07.140> as<00:01:07.409> you<00:01:08.159> wind<00:01:08.430> it<00:01:08.670> if<00:01:09.000> you<00:01:09.180> don't<00:01:09.360> feel

00:01:09.649 --> 00:01:09.659 
spring as you wind it if you don't feel

00:01:09.659 --> 00:01:11.030 
spring as you wind it if you don't feel
this<00:01:09.900> then<00:01:10.110> you're<00:01:10.260> doing<00:01:10.470> something<00:01:10.680> wrong

00:01:11.030 --> 00:01:11.040 
this then you're doing something wrong

00:01:11.040 --> 00:01:15.670 
this then you're doing something wrong
so<00:01:11.909> just<00:01:12.119> to<00:01:12.180> recap<00:01:12.799> let's<00:01:13.799> screw<00:01:14.130> it<00:01:14.220> back<00:01:14.369> in

00:01:15.670 --> 00:01:15.680 
so just to recap let's screw it back in

00:01:15.680 --> 00:01:22.039 
so just to recap let's screw it back in
first<00:01:17.150> reverse<00:01:18.150> turn<00:01:18.450> the<00:01:18.600> winder<00:01:19.610> as<00:01:21.049> I'm

00:01:22.039 --> 00:01:22.049 
first reverse turn the winder as I'm

00:01:22.049 --> 00:01:24.140 
first reverse turn the winder as I'm
doing<00:01:22.229> here<00:01:22.369> until<00:01:23.369> you<00:01:23.460> feel<00:01:23.670> it<00:01:23.700> come<00:01:23.970> loose

00:01:24.140 --> 00:01:24.150 
doing here until you feel it come loose

00:01:24.150 --> 00:01:27.830 
doing here until you feel it come loose
from<00:01:24.180> the<00:01:24.509> thread<00:01:24.810> and<00:01:25.740> then<00:01:26.659> wind<00:01:27.659> it

00:01:27.830 --> 00:01:27.840 
from the thread and then wind it

00:01:27.840 --> 00:01:32.030 
from the thread and then wind it
forwards<00:01:28.670> clockwise<00:01:30.590> feel<00:01:31.590> the<00:01:31.740> spring

00:01:32.030 --> 00:01:32.040 
forwards clockwise feel the spring

00:01:32.040 --> 00:01:35.270 
forwards clockwise feel the spring
tighten<00:01:32.549> when<00:01:33.240> the<00:01:33.360> spring<00:01:33.689> feels<00:01:34.229> like<00:01:35.070> it's

00:01:35.270 --> 00:01:35.280 
tighten when the spring feels like it's

00:01:35.280 --> 00:01:35.810 
tighten when the spring feels like it's
tight<00:01:35.460> enough

00:01:35.810 --> 00:01:35.820 
tight enough

00:01:35.820 --> 00:01:39.319

00:01:43.520 --> 00:01:43.530 
winding and in order to set the time and

00:01:43.530 --> 00:01:47.810 
winding and in order to set the time and
date<00:01:44.420> pull<00:01:45.420> the<00:01:45.450> crown<00:01:45.540> out<00:01:45.780> one<00:01:46.320> notch<00:01:46.820> very

00:02:37.510 --> 00:02:40.590 
when winding which by the way has to be
done<00:02:37.660> once<00:02:37.900> per<00:02:38.140> day<00:02:38.820> and<00:02:39.820> I<00:02:40.000> suggest<00:02:40.390> that<00:02:40.450> you

00:02:40.590 --> 00:02:40.600 
done once per day and I suggest that you

00:02:40.600 --> 00:02:42.420 
done once per day and I suggest that you
do<00:02:40.690> it<00:02:40.810> in<00:02:40.930> the<00:02:41.019> evening<00:02:41.380> the<00:02:42.070> reason<00:02:42.370> you

00:02:42.420 --> 00:02:42.430 
do it in the evening the reason you

00:02:42.430 --> 00:02:44.729 
do it in the evening the reason you
should<00:02:42.459> keep<00:02:42.790> the<00:02:43.000> crown<00:02:43.239> tight<00:02:43.750> to<00:02:44.350> the<00:02:44.470> case

00:02:44.729 --> 00:02:44.739 
should keep the crown tight to the case

00:02:44.739 --> 00:02:49.590 
should keep the crown tight to the case
is<00:02:45.330> that<00:02:46.330> it<00:02:47.260> improves<00:02:47.769> its<00:02:48.160> water<00:02:49.030> resistance

00:02:49.590 --> 00:02:49.600 
is that it improves its water resistance

00:02:49.600 --> 00:02:54.360 
is that it improves its water resistance
if<00:02:50.260> you<00:02:51.220> take<00:02:51.430> the<00:02:51.610> watch<00:02:51.820> out<00:02:52.600> and<00:02:53.160> the<00:02:54.160> crown

00:02:54.360 --> 00:02:54.370 
if you take the watch out and the crown

00:02:54.370 --> 00:02:56.870 
if you take the watch out and the crown
isn't<00:02:54.730> tight<00:02:55.000> there's<00:02:55.480> a<00:02:55.570> possibility<00:02:55.959> that

00:02:56.870 --> 00:02:56.880 
isn't tight there's a possibility that

00:02:56.880 --> 00:02:58.979 
isn't tight there's a possibility that
moisture<00:02:57.880> could<00:02:58.000> get<00:02:58.180> into<00:02:58.390> the<00:02:58.480> mechanism

00:02:58.979 --> 00:02:58.989 
moisture could get into the mechanism

00:02:58.989 --> 00:03:01.580 
moisture could get into the mechanism
which<00:02:59.709> will<00:02:59.950> cause<00:03:00.250> rusting

00:03:01.580 --> 00:03:01.590 
which will cause rusting

00:03:01.590 --> 00:03:05.400 
which will cause rusting
so<00:03:02.590> just<00:03:02.860> to<00:03:02.950> recap<00:03:03.130> briefly<00:03:04.170> reverse<00:03:05.170> turn

00:03:05.400 --> 00:03:05.410 
so just to recap briefly reverse turn

00:03:05.410 --> 00:03:07.680 
so just to recap briefly reverse turn
