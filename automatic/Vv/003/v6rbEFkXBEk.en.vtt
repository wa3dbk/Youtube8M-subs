00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.069
 hello everybody often write me that i 

00:00:02.580 --> 00:00:07.620
 your dogs don't eat that they are a little 

00:00:05.069 --> 00:00:09.750
 inappetenti so I thought about doing 

00:00:07.620 --> 00:00:11.340
 two videos on this topic and divide 

00:00:09.750 --> 00:00:13.769
 today what the causes may be 

00:00:11.340 --> 00:00:16.289
 at the origin of this behavior 

00:00:13.769 --> 00:00:18.390
 first of all you need to be sure 

00:00:16.289 --> 00:00:20.400
 what a dog is good because they can 

00:00:18.390 --> 00:00:22.650
 for example, there are disturbances 

00:00:20.400 --> 00:00:24.689
 gastrointestinal or dental problems 

00:00:22.650 --> 00:00:26.550
 which lead to the dog not to eat 

00:00:24.689 --> 00:00:28.670
 therefore important to bring it from 

00:00:26.550 --> 00:00:31.529
 veterinarian and make a complete check up 

00:00:28.670 --> 00:00:34.320
 exclude the presence of other diseases 

00:00:31.529 --> 00:00:36.170
 reasons why the dog can eat little 

00:00:34.320 --> 00:00:38.820
 they are for example very hot 

00:00:36.170 --> 00:00:42.360
 or who feels the presence of females 

00:00:38.820 --> 00:00:44.520
 in heat or that some gods have occurred 

00:00:42.360 --> 00:00:46.980
 substantial changes in his life 

00:00:44.520 --> 00:00:49.800
 like the arrival of a child or a child 

00:00:46.980 --> 00:00:52.110
 moving house, or even a trip that 

00:00:49.800 --> 00:00:53.850
 a little upset though these are 

00:00:52.110 --> 00:00:56.370
 all 

00:00:53.850 --> 00:00:58.770
 all things between transient then dog 

00:00:56.370 --> 00:01:00.149
 eat less for a while but then 

00:00:58.770 --> 00:01:01.980
 the usual one returns 

00:01:00.149 --> 00:01:04.860
 if we exclude all these factors 

00:01:01.980 --> 00:01:07.500
 education remains like us 

00:01:04.860 --> 00:01:09.780
 we have used the dog to eat not 

00:01:07.500 --> 00:01:12.840
 it's ok for example to leave them all 

00:01:09.780 --> 00:01:14.250
 day available, this jelly 

00:01:12.840 --> 00:01:17.100
 brings the dog to be 

00:01:14.250 --> 00:01:20.220
 inappetent and also gives him a message 

00:01:17.100 --> 00:01:22.259
 wrong or that he to manage a 

00:01:20.220 --> 00:01:26.310
 resource as important as food 

00:01:22.259 --> 00:01:30.060
 also give him many extras like snacks 

00:01:26.310 --> 00:01:31.619
 during the day I have too many awards can 

00:01:30.060 --> 00:01:33.329
 bring the dog no longer eat his 

00:01:31.619 --> 00:01:36.329
 jelly because obviously he is looking for something 

00:01:33.329 --> 00:01:39.420
 more palatable and still not feeling 

00:01:36.329 --> 00:01:41.310
 hunger because spizzica during 

00:01:39.420 --> 00:01:43.470
 day also vary too 

00:01:41.310 --> 00:01:46.079
 the power then to give them sometimes 

00:01:43.470 --> 00:01:48.840
 its croquettes sometimes homemade food 

00:01:46.079 --> 00:01:52.170
 can lead the dog to select the 

00:01:48.840 --> 00:01:54.750
 more appetizing things and therefore to discard 

00:01:52.170 --> 00:01:57.480
 his croquettes also eating of 

00:01:54.750 --> 00:02:00.030
 the less the stomach shrinks and therefore 

00:01:57.480 --> 00:02:01.860
 the dog has less and less hunger some 

00:02:00.030 --> 00:02:04.440
 they even go so far as to take the 

00:02:01.860 --> 00:02:06.660
 dog I recommend this does not exist a 

00:02:04.440 --> 00:02:10.440
 unless the dog is not sick but this 

00:02:06.660 --> 00:02:13.410
 it is the first case precisely because the dog 

00:02:10.440 --> 00:02:15.630
 in this way it takes taste in the sense 

00:02:13.410 --> 00:02:17.870
 that has a lot of attention for him 

00:02:15.630 --> 00:02:20.640
 that surely make me happy 

00:02:17.870 --> 00:02:22.590
 recapitulating already avoiding doing 

00:02:20.640 --> 00:02:25.230
 these errors the situation improves 

00:02:22.590 --> 00:02:27.120
 much in the next video then I'll give you 

00:02:25.230 --> 00:02:30.030
 some tips on how to restore 

00:02:27.120 --> 00:02:33.260
 the normal meal routine 

00:02:30.030 --> 00:02:33.260
 see you soon. Bye
