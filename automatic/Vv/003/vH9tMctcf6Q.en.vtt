to be a few days and you probably can't

00:00:15.639 --> 00:00:16.769 
to be a few days and you probably can't
until<00:00:15.849> in<00:00:15.910> this<00:00:16.000> video<00:00:16.240> because<00:00:16.330> it's<00:00:16.539> you

until in this video because it's you

00:00:16.779 --> 00:00:18.390 
until in this video because it's you
know<00:00:16.810> just<00:00:17.080> went<00:00:17.230> from<00:00:17.380> the<00:00:17.740> last<00:00:17.950> up<00:00:18.130> to<00:00:18.160> here

00:00:18.390 --> 00:00:18.400 
know just went from the last up to here

00:00:18.400 --> 00:00:20.220 
know just went from the last up to here
but<00:00:18.880> actually<00:00:19.000> in<00:00:19.240> the<00:00:19.300> VN<00:00:19.540> a<00:00:19.630> lot<00:00:19.810> more<00:00:20.020> than<00:00:20.200> a

00:00:20.220 --> 00:00:20.230 
but actually in the VN a lot more than a

00:00:20.230 --> 00:00:21.659 
but actually in the VN a lot more than a
few<00:00:20.470> days<00:00:20.590> it's<00:00:20.830> actually<00:00:21.130> several<00:00:21.400> weeks<00:00:21.550> is

00:00:21.659 --> 00:00:21.669 
few days it's actually several weeks is

00:00:21.669 --> 00:00:22.710 
few days it's actually several weeks is
probably<00:00:21.759> almost<00:00:22.060> close<00:00:22.330> to<00:00:22.450> a<00:00:22.509> month

00:00:22.710 --> 00:00:22.720 
probably almost close to a month

00:00:22.720 --> 00:00:25.650 
probably almost close to a month
actually<00:00:23.050> and<00:00:23.910> we<00:00:24.910> got<00:00:25.029> a<00:00:25.060> ton<00:00:25.329> of<00:00:25.360> stuff<00:00:25.539> done

00:00:25.650 --> 00:00:25.660 
actually and we got a ton of stuff done

00:00:25.660 --> 00:00:28.290 
actually and we got a ton of stuff done
with<00:00:26.050> painted<00:00:26.380> walls<00:00:26.619> and<00:00:27.070> I'm<00:00:27.160> now<00:00:27.880> working

00:00:28.290 --> 00:00:28.300 
with painted walls and I'm now working

00:00:28.300 --> 00:00:30.359 
with painted walls and I'm now working
on<00:00:28.570> the<00:00:28.779> window<00:00:29.200> trim<00:00:29.529> and<00:00:29.919> we've<00:00:30.040> done<00:00:30.250> the

00:00:30.359 --> 00:00:30.369 
on the window trim and we've done the

00:00:30.369 --> 00:00:31.740 
on the window trim and we've done the
ceiling<00:00:30.849> and<00:00:31.000> hung<00:00:31.149> some<00:00:31.329> lights<00:00:31.509> and

00:00:31.740 --> 00:00:31.750 
ceiling and hung some lights and

00:00:31.750 --> 00:00:33.780 
ceiling and hung some lights and
basically<00:00:32.469> what<00:00:32.619> we've<00:00:32.770> done<00:00:32.800> is<00:00:33.250> a<00:00:33.280> lot<00:00:33.550> of

00:00:33.780 --> 00:00:33.790 
basically what we've done is a lot of

00:00:33.790 --> 00:00:37.410 
basically what we've done is a lot of
the<00:00:33.969> above<00:00:34.600> the<00:00:34.780> floor<00:00:34.989> work<00:00:35.290> that<00:00:36.270> you<00:00:37.270> know

00:00:37.410 --> 00:00:37.420 
the above the floor work that you know

00:00:37.420 --> 00:00:38.790 
the above the floor work that you know
would<00:00:37.629> end<00:00:37.780> up<00:00:37.870> just<00:00:37.930> getting<00:00:38.320> all<00:00:38.559> over<00:00:38.590> the

00:00:38.790 --> 00:00:38.800 
would end up just getting all over the

00:00:38.800 --> 00:00:40.380 
would end up just getting all over the
floor<00:00:39.010> if<00:00:39.129> we<00:00:39.250> went<00:00:39.399> ahead<00:00:39.489> and<00:00:39.610> did<00:00:39.760> it<00:00:40.149> first

00:00:40.380 --> 00:00:40.390 
floor if we went ahead and did it first

00:00:40.390 --> 00:00:43.529 
floor if we went ahead and did it first
so<00:00:40.629> that's<00:00:40.989> a<00:00:41.200> you<00:00:41.920> know<00:00:42.040> pretty<00:00:42.219> well<00:00:42.610> known

00:00:43.529 --> 00:00:43.539 
so that's a you know pretty well known

00:00:43.539 --> 00:00:45.509 
so that's a you know pretty well known
common<00:00:43.929> tip<00:00:44.140> but<00:00:44.320> just<00:00:44.469> in<00:00:44.620> case<00:00:45.039> something

00:00:45.509 --> 00:00:45.519 
common tip but just in case something

00:00:45.519 --> 00:00:48.000 
common tip but just in case something
happens<00:00:45.820> is<00:00:46.269> the<00:00:46.929> you<00:00:47.679> know<00:00:47.739> if<00:00:47.859> you're<00:00:47.980> doing

00:00:48.000 --> 00:00:48.010 
happens is the you know if you're doing

00:00:48.010 --> 00:00:49.319 
happens is the you know if you're doing
a<00:00:48.219> whole<00:00:48.339> renovation<00:00:48.579> the<00:00:48.879> flooring<00:00:49.239> is

00:00:49.319 --> 00:00:49.329 
a whole renovation the flooring is

00:00:49.329 --> 00:00:50.549 
a whole renovation the flooring is
probably<00:00:49.570> the<00:00:49.719> very<00:00:49.899> last<00:00:50.199> things<00:00:50.440> you<00:00:50.530> want

00:00:50.549 --> 00:00:50.559 
probably the very last things you want

00:00:50.559 --> 00:00:52.110 
probably the very last things you want
to<00:00:50.710> do<00:00:50.829> so<00:00:51.010> I<00:00:51.039> doesn't<00:00:51.309> get<00:00:51.399> all<00:00:51.489> banged<00:00:51.760> up<00:00:51.909> and

we'll get some better
but<00:02:07.690> this<00:02:07.930> is<00:02:08.080> a<00:02:08.110> really<00:02:08.710> low<00:02:08.860> budget

00:02:09.590 --> 00:02:09.600 
but this is a really low budget

00:02:09.600 --> 00:02:12.840 
but this is a really low budget
renovation<00:02:10.600> so<00:02:11.310> you<00:02:12.310> know<00:02:12.400> we're<00:02:12.640> using<00:02:12.790> a

00:02:12.840 --> 00:02:12.850 
renovation so you know we're using a

00:02:12.850 --> 00:02:14.250 
renovation so you know we're using a
good<00:02:12.970> deal<00:02:13.090> from<00:02:13.300> nars<00:02:13.480> but<00:02:13.630> anyway<00:02:13.810> what<00:02:14.230> I

00:02:14.250 --> 00:02:14.260 
good deal from nars but anyway what I

00:02:14.260 --> 00:02:15.990 
good deal from nars but anyway what I
want<00:02:14.410> to<00:02:14.470> show<00:02:14.530> you<00:02:14.590> is<00:02:14.770> that<00:02:14.800> to<00:02:15.520> make<00:02:15.700> the

00:02:15.990 --> 00:02:16.000 
want to show you is that to make the

00:02:16.000 --> 00:02:18.450 
want to show you is that to make the
whitewash<00:02:16.660> it's<00:02:16.900> really<00:02:17.200> really<00:02:17.410> simple<00:02:17.560> we

00:02:18.450 --> 00:02:18.460 
whitewash it's really really simple we

00:02:18.460 --> 00:02:19.740 
whitewash it's really really simple we
kind<00:02:18.730> of<00:02:18.850> test<00:02:19.090> it<00:02:19.210> around<00:02:19.450> and<00:02:19.690> this

00:02:19.740 --> 00:02:19.750 
kind of test it around and this

00:02:19.750 --> 00:02:20.580 
kind of test it around and this
something<00:02:19.990> you're<00:02:20.080> going<00:02:20.170> to<00:02:20.260> want<00:02:20.380> to<00:02:20.440> play

something you're going to want to play

00:02:20.590 --> 00:02:23.610 
something you're going to want to play
with<00:02:20.740> in<00:02:20.920> a<00:02:21.010> small<00:02:21.280> amount<00:02:21.690> but<00:02:22.690> we<00:02:22.810> figure<00:02:23.590> out

00:02:23.610 --> 00:02:23.620 
with in a small amount but we figure out

00:02:23.620 --> 00:02:26.880 
with in a small amount but we figure out
the<00:02:23.770> ratio<00:02:24.160> that<00:02:24.190> we<00:02:24.490> like<00:02:24.730> is<00:02:25.890> somewhere

00:02:26.880 --> 00:02:26.890 
the ratio that we like is somewhere

00:02:26.890 --> 00:02:30.360 
the ratio that we like is somewhere
between<00:02:27.070> two<00:02:27.550> and<00:02:27.850> three<00:02:28.170> to<00:02:29.170> one<00:02:29.410> which<00:02:30.040> means

00:02:30.360 --> 00:02:30.370 
between two and three to one which means

00:02:30.370 --> 00:02:34.050 
between two and three to one which means
one<00:02:31.240> part<00:02:31.510> paint<00:02:31.810> to<00:02:32.500> two<00:02:32.650> parts<00:02:32.860> water<00:02:33.160> or<00:02:33.520> one

00:02:34.050 --> 00:02:34.060 
one part paint to two parts water or one

00:02:34.060 --> 00:02:35.490 
one part paint to two parts water or one
part<00:02:34.300> paint<00:02:34.480> to<00:02:34.720> three<00:02:34.930> parts<00:02:35.200> water

00:02:35.490 --> 00:02:35.500 
part paint to three parts water

00:02:35.500 --> 00:02:37.050 
part paint to three parts water
ours<00:02:35.620> is<00:02:35.800> probably<00:02:36.190> like<00:02:36.430> two<00:02:36.670> and<00:02:36.820> a<00:02:36.850> half

00:02:37.050 --> 00:02:37.060 
ours is probably like two and a half

00:02:37.060 --> 00:02:39.120 
ours is probably like two and a half
something<00:02:37.510> like<00:02:37.690> that<00:02:37.990> and<00:02:38.080> because<00:02:38.800> we're

00:02:39.120 --> 00:02:39.130 
something like that and because we're

00:02:39.130 --> 00:02:41.070

00:03:11.920 --> 00:03:13.620 
living room and there's a back room
there<00:03:12.100> and<00:03:12.160> there's<00:03:12.580> a<00:03:12.640> I<00:03:13.090> call<00:03:13.269> it<00:03:13.360> the<00:03:13.420> drum

00:03:13.620 --> 00:03:13.630 
there and there's a I call it the drum

00:03:13.630 --> 00:03:15.000 
there and there's a I call it the drum
room<00:03:13.780> back<00:03:13.930> there<00:03:13.959> somebody<00:03:14.500> put<00:03:14.620> a<00:03:14.650> drum<00:03:14.890> set

00:03:15.000 --> 00:03:15.010 
room back there somebody put a drum set

00:03:15.010 --> 00:03:16.830 
room back there somebody put a drum set
back<00:03:15.190> there<00:03:15.340> but<00:03:15.519> all<00:03:16.060> these<00:03:16.480> floors<00:03:16.750> are

00:03:16.830 --> 00:03:16.840 
back there but all these floors are

00:03:16.840 --> 00:03:18.410 
back there but all these floors are
going<00:03:16.959> to<00:03:17.049> be<00:03:17.140> covered<00:03:17.470> in<00:03:17.590> the<00:03:17.739> wood<00:03:17.920> planks

00:03:18.410 --> 00:03:18.420 
going to be covered in the wood planks

00:03:18.420 --> 00:03:21.479 
going to be covered in the wood planks
so<00:03:19.420> we<00:03:19.540> need<00:03:19.660> a<00:03:19.690> whole<00:03:19.780> bunch<00:03:19.989> of<00:03:20.140> it<00:03:20.290> so<00:03:20.920> I

00:03:21.479 --> 00:03:21.489 
so we need a whole bunch of it so I

00:03:21.489 --> 00:03:23.520 
so we need a whole bunch of it so I
don't<00:03:22.239> know<00:03:22.450> exact<00:03:22.810> amount<00:03:23.140> so<00:03:23.320> I'm<00:03:23.380> actually

00:03:23.520 --> 00:03:23.530 
don't know exact amount so I'm actually

00:03:23.530 --> 00:03:25.500 
don't know exact amount so I'm actually
running<00:03:23.830> low<00:03:24.160> on<00:03:24.400> this<00:03:24.580> already<00:03:24.910> and<00:03:25.269> we're

00:03:25.500 --> 00:03:25.510 
running low on this already and we're

00:03:25.510 --> 00:03:27.180 
running low on this already and we're
probably<00:03:25.720> only<00:03:25.930> 1/3<00:03:26.230> way<00:03:26.470> through<00:03:26.709> but<00:03:26.860> anyway

00:03:27.180 --> 00:03:27.190 
probably only 1/3 way through but anyway

00:03:27.190 --> 00:03:30.479 
probably only 1/3 way through but anyway
I<00:03:27.220> did<00:03:27.489> a<00:03:27.700> whole<00:03:28.299> gallon<00:03:28.750> of<00:03:28.900> paint<00:03:29.280> to<00:03:30.280> about

00:03:30.479 --> 00:03:30.489 
I did a whole gallon of paint to about

00:03:30.489 --> 00:03:32.759 
I did a whole gallon of paint to about
two<00:03:30.700> and<00:03:30.730> a<00:03:30.850> half<00:03:31.060> gallons<00:03:31.570> and<00:03:32.230> actually<00:03:32.620> just

00:03:32.759 --> 00:03:32.769 
two and a half gallons and actually just

00:03:32.769 --> 00:03:36.750 
two and a half gallons and actually just
use<00:03:32.920> the<00:03:32.950> paint<00:03:34.440> gallon<00:03:35.440> after<00:03:35.890> I<00:03:36.160> it<00:03:36.220> you<00:03:36.640> know

00:03:36.750 --> 00:03:36.760 
use the paint gallon after I it you know

00:03:36.760 --> 00:03:38.220 
use the paint gallon after I it you know
dump<00:03:37.180> the<00:03:37.299> paint<00:03:37.510> into<00:03:37.720> a<00:03:37.750> five-gallon<00:03:38.200> bucket

00:03:38.220 --> 00:03:38.230 
dump the paint into a five-gallon bucket

00:03:38.230 --> 00:03:40.050 
dump the paint into a five-gallon bucket
and<00:03:38.890> I<00:03:38.920> just<00:03:39.130> filled<00:03:39.310> it<00:03:39.430> up<00:03:39.519> again<00:03:39.760> two<00:03:39.880> and<00:03:40.030> a

00:03:40.050 --> 00:03:40.060 
and I just filled it up again two and a

00:03:40.060 --> 00:03:41.670 
and I just filled it up again two and a
half<00:03:40.180> times<00:03:40.420> and<00:03:41.110> put<00:03:41.260> the<00:03:41.350> water<00:03:41.500> in<00:03:41.620> there

00:03:41.670 --> 00:03:41.680 
half times and put the water in there

00:03:41.680 --> 00:03:43.530 
half times and put the water in there
and<00:03:41.860> then<00:03:42.130> you<00:03:42.280> just<00:03:42.459> get<00:03:42.670> you<00:03:43.180> could<00:03:43.330> use<00:03:43.510> a

00:03:43.530 --> 00:03:43.540 
and then you just get you could use a

00:03:43.540 --> 00:03:45.180 
and then you just get you could use a
stick<00:03:43.810> but<00:03:44.049> it's<00:03:44.290> a<00:03:44.410> lot<00:03:44.620> easier<00:03:44.650> if<00:03:45.040> you<00:03:45.160> have

00:03:45.180 --> 00:03:45.190 
stick but it's a lot easier if you have

00:03:45.190 --> 00:03:47.270 
stick but it's a lot easier if you have
a<00:03:45.310> little<00:03:45.549> paint<00:03:45.730> mixer<00:03:46.000> with<00:03:46.269> a<00:03:46.299> drill<00:03:46.660> and

00:03:47.270 --> 00:03:47.280 
a little paint mixer with a drill and

00:03:47.280 --> 00:03:49.560 
a little paint mixer with a drill and
what<00:03:48.280> happens<00:03:48.610> is<00:03:48.760> the<00:03:48.910> paint<00:03:49.150> gets<00:03:49.330> really

00:03:49.560 --> 00:03:49.570 
what happens is the paint gets really

00:03:49.570 --> 00:03:51.210 
what happens is the paint gets really
thin<00:03:49.780> it's<00:03:49.959> almost<00:03:50.080> like<00:03:50.230> milk<00:03:50.530> you<00:03:50.950> see<00:03:51.130> in

00:03:51.210 --> 00:03:51.220 
thin it's almost like milk you see in

00:03:51.220 --> 00:03:55.800 
thin it's almost like milk you see in
here<00:03:51.400> when<00:03:51.519> I<00:03:51.580> when<00:03:51.820> I<00:03:51.850> stir<00:03:52.180> it

00:03:55.800 --> 00:03:55.810 

00:03:55.810 --> 00:03:57.600 

it<00:03:56.290> districts<00:03:56.770> I<00:03:56.800> mean<00:03:56.920> it's<00:03:57.010> exactly<00:03:57.340> almost

00:03:57.600 --> 00:03:57.610 
it districts I mean it's exactly almost

00:03:57.610 --> 00:04:00.089 
it districts I mean it's exactly almost
like<00:03:57.849> you<00:03:58.780> know<00:03:58.870> skim<00:03:59.560> milk<00:03:59.770> or<00:03:59.950> something

00:04:00.089 --> 00:04:00.099 
like you know skim milk or something

00:04:00.099 --> 00:04:04.110 
like you know skim milk or something
like<00:04:00.220> that<00:04:00.400> but<00:04:02.430> really<00:04:03.430> simple<00:04:03.700> how<00:04:03.760> to<00:04:03.819> do<00:04:03.970> it

00:04:04.110 --> 00:04:04.120 
like that but really simple how to do it

00:04:04.120 --> 00:04:06.630 
like that but really simple how to do it
what<00:04:04.510> I<00:04:04.540> actually<00:04:04.720> am<00:04:04.930> using<00:04:05.080> is<00:04:05.319> a<00:04:05.640> just

00:04:06.630 --> 00:04:06.640 
what I actually am using is a just

00:04:06.640 --> 00:04:10.050 
what I actually am using is a just
regular<00:04:06.910> pink<00:04:07.090> roller<00:04:07.330> with<00:04:07.870> a<00:04:08.700> semi<00:04:09.700> nappy

00:04:10.050 --> 00:04:10.060 
regular pink roller with a semi nappy

00:04:10.060 --> 00:04:12.809 
regular pink roller with a semi nappy
roller<00:04:10.270> because<00:04:11.430> hopefully<00:04:12.430> this<00:04:12.550> will<00:04:12.640> show

00:04:12.809 --> 00:04:12.819 
roller because hopefully this will show

00:04:12.819 --> 00:04:14.699 
roller because hopefully this will show
up<00:04:13.000> but<00:04:13.360> the<00:04:13.540> board<00:04:13.780> has<00:04:13.989> some<00:04:14.170> texture<00:04:14.470> to<00:04:14.680> it

00:04:14.699 --> 00:04:14.709 
up but the board has some texture to it

00:04:14.709 --> 00:04:16.110 
up but the board has some texture to it
so<00:04:14.980> you<00:04:15.130> want<00:04:15.280> to<00:04:15.370> be<00:04:15.430> able<00:04:15.519> to<00:04:15.640> get<00:04:15.790> into<00:04:16.060> all

00:04:16.110 --> 00:04:16.120 
so you want to be able to get into all

00:04:16.120 --> 00:04:19.379 
so you want to be able to get into all
the<00:04:16.269> little<00:04:16.450> grooves<00:04:16.720> and<00:04:16.930> stuff<00:04:18.150> so<00:04:19.150> we're

00:04:19.379 --> 00:04:19.389 
the little grooves and stuff so we're

00:04:19.389 --> 00:04:22.350 
the little grooves and stuff so we're
using<00:04:19.540> a<00:04:19.919> rolling<00:04:20.919> over<00:04:21.160> nap<00:04:21.370> they<00:04:22.210> got

00:04:22.350 --> 00:04:22.360 
using a rolling over nap they got

00:04:22.360 --> 00:04:23.370 
using a rolling over nap they got
different<00:04:22.480> sizes<00:04:22.780> we<00:04:23.020> just<00:04:23.200> grabbed<00:04:23.350> some

00:04:23.370 --> 00:04:23.380 
different sizes we just grabbed some

00:04:23.380 --> 00:04:25.140 
different sizes we just grabbed some
that<00:04:23.770> were<00:04:23.889> you<00:04:24.340> know<00:04:24.370> not<00:04:24.610> totally<00:04:24.910> smooth

00:04:25.140 --> 00:04:25.150 
that were you know not totally smooth

00:04:25.150 --> 00:04:26.490 
that were you know not totally smooth
it's<00:04:25.300> not<00:04:25.389> foam<00:04:25.660> roll<00:04:25.870> or<00:04:25.990> anything<00:04:26.200> it's<00:04:26.440> just

00:04:26.490 --> 00:04:26.500 
it's not foam roll or anything it's just

00:04:26.500 --> 00:04:29.820 
it's not foam roll or anything it's just
a<00:04:26.650> regular<00:04:26.919> nasty<00:04:27.190> one<00:04:27.310> and<00:04:27.490> then<00:04:28.560> this<00:04:29.560> roll

00:04:29.820 --> 00:04:29.830 
a regular nasty one and then this roll

00:04:29.830 --> 00:04:30.960 
a regular nasty one and then this roll
what<00:04:29.919> you<00:04:30.010> want<00:04:30.130> to<00:04:30.190> get<00:04:30.280> it<00:04:30.370> totally<00:04:30.639> covered

00:04:30.960 --> 00:04:30.970 
what you want to get it totally covered

00:04:30.970 --> 00:04:32.820 
what you want to get it totally covered
you<00:04:31.660> can<00:04:31.720> see<00:04:31.900> how<00:04:32.020> thin<00:04:32.290> that<00:04:32.320> paint<00:04:32.680> really

00:04:32.820 --> 00:04:32.830 
you can see how thin that paint really

00:04:32.830 --> 00:04:35.700 
you can see how thin that paint really
is<00:04:33.210> and<00:04:34.210> this<00:04:34.510> is<00:04:34.660> the<00:04:34.750> weird<00:04:34.900> part<00:04:35.080> it'll<00:04:35.470> be<00:04:35.680> a

00:04:35.700 --> 00:04:35.710 
is and this is the weird part it'll be a

00:04:35.710 --> 00:04:37.020 
is and this is the weird part it'll be a
little<00:04:35.860> weird<00:04:36.070> when<00:04:36.280> you<00:04:36.400> actually<00:04:36.580> roll<00:04:36.910> it

00:04:37.020 --> 00:04:37.030 
little weird when you actually roll it

00:04:37.030 --> 00:04:42.060 
little weird when you actually roll it
onto<00:04:37.210> the<00:04:38.010> board<00:04:39.660> but<00:04:40.660> when<00:04:40.750> you<00:04:40.810> put<00:04:40.990> on<00:04:41.139> you

00:04:42.060 --> 00:04:42.070 
onto the board but when you put on you

00:04:42.070 --> 00:04:43.740 
onto the board but when you put on you
know<00:04:42.190> you<00:04:42.250> can<00:04:42.520> see<00:04:42.760> it's<00:04:43.060> going<00:04:43.330> on<00:04:43.419> but<00:04:43.660> it

00:04:43.740 --> 00:04:43.750 
know you can see it's going on but it

00:04:43.750 --> 00:04:45.120 
know you can see it's going on but it
almost<00:04:43.900> doesn't<00:04:44.350> look<00:04:44.440> like<00:04:44.590> anything<00:04:44.860> like<00:04:45.040> I

00:04:45.120 --> 00:04:45.130 
almost doesn't look like anything like I

00:04:45.130 --> 00:04:47.159 
almost doesn't look like anything like I
rolled<00:04:45.370> right<00:04:45.850> there<00:04:46.150> I<00:04:46.360> mean<00:04:46.540> look<00:04:46.660> compare

00:04:47.159 --> 00:04:47.169 
rolled right there I mean look compare

00:04:47.169 --> 00:04:49.500 
rolled right there I mean look compare

there<00:04:49.660> doesn't<00:04:49.870> look<00:04:49.990> any<00:04:50.229> different<00:04:50.320> now

00:04:50.610 --> 00:04:50.620 
there doesn't look any different now

00:04:50.620 --> 00:04:52.290 
there doesn't look any different now
once<00:04:51.100> it<00:04:51.220> starts<00:04:51.430> drying<00:04:51.610> it's<00:04:51.790> really<00:04:52.150> going

00:04:52.290 --> 00:04:52.300 
once it starts drying it's really going

00:04:52.300 --> 00:04:53.520 
once it starts drying it's really going
to<00:04:52.360> change<00:04:52.510> dramatically<00:04:52.990> so<00:04:53.169> don't<00:04:53.350> freak

00:04:53.520 --> 00:04:53.530 
to change dramatically so don't freak

00:04:53.530 --> 00:04:55.680 
to change dramatically so don't freak
out<00:04:53.740> if<00:04:53.979> you<00:04:54.580> know<00:04:54.700> you're<00:04:54.880> rolling<00:04:55.300> all<00:04:55.540> this

00:04:55.680 --> 00:04:55.690 
out if you know you're rolling all this

00:04:55.690 --> 00:04:57.090 
out if you know you're rolling all this
on<00:04:55.870> there<00:04:56.110> and<00:04:56.350> it<00:04:56.530> doesn't<00:04:56.740> look<00:04:56.800> like<00:04:56.889> it's

00:04:57.090 --> 00:04:57.100 
on there and it doesn't look like it's

00:04:57.100 --> 00:04:59.460 
on there and it doesn't look like it's
do<00:04:57.250> anything<00:04:57.669> that's<00:04:58.210> really<00:04:58.330> simple<00:04:58.720> the

00:04:59.460 --> 00:04:59.470 
do anything that's really simple the

00:04:59.470 --> 00:05:00.480 
do anything that's really simple the
boards<00:04:59.710> are<00:04:59.800> eight<00:04:59.890> inches<00:05:00.130> wide<00:05:00.310> and<00:05:00.400> this

00:05:00.480 --> 00:05:00.490 
boards are eight inches wide and this

00:05:00.490 --> 00:05:01.800 
boards are eight inches wide and this
roll<00:05:00.669> is<00:05:00.700> about<00:05:00.820> nine<00:05:01.120> inches<00:05:01.390> so<00:05:01.570> it<00:05:01.660> works

00:05:01.800 --> 00:05:01.810 
roll is about nine inches so it works

00:05:01.810 --> 00:05:04.440 
roll is about nine inches so it works
perfect<00:05:02.229> and<00:05:02.440> I<00:05:02.950> just<00:05:02.979> like<00:05:03.250> to<00:05:03.430> go<00:05:04.030> over<00:05:04.270> kind

00:05:04.440 --> 00:05:04.450 
perfect and I just like to go over kind

00:05:04.450 --> 00:05:08.040 
perfect and I just like to go over kind
of<00:05:04.570> get<00:05:04.720> it<00:05:06.330> you<00:05:07.330> know<00:05:07.419> covered<00:05:07.720> pretty<00:05:07.840> good

00:05:08.040 --> 00:05:08.050 
of get it you know covered pretty good

00:05:08.050 --> 00:05:09.210 
of get it you know covered pretty good
but<00:05:08.229> then<00:05:08.350> you<00:05:08.380> want<00:05:08.530> to<00:05:08.680> kind<00:05:08.860> of<00:05:08.890> go<00:05:08.979> back<00:05:09.190> and

00:05:09.210 --> 00:05:09.220 
but then you want to kind of go back and

00:05:09.220 --> 00:05:11.040 
but then you want to kind of go back and
hit<00:05:09.580> all<00:05:09.610> the<00:05:09.789> little<00:05:09.970> sections<00:05:10.330> you'll<00:05:10.930> be

00:05:11.040 --> 00:05:11.050

hit all the little sections you'll be
able<00:05:11.110> to<00:05:11.260> see<00:05:11.350> sections<00:05:11.740> that<00:05:11.890> are<00:05:12.240> you<00:05:13.240> know

00:05:13.320 --> 00:05:13.330 
able to see sections that are you know

00:05:13.330 --> 00:05:15.719 
able to see sections that are you know
getting<00:05:13.570> covered<00:05:13.870> in<00:05:13.990> the<00:05:14.169> in<00:05:14.410> the<00:05:15.340> whitewash

00:05:15.719 --> 00:05:15.729 
getting covered in the in the whitewash

00:05:15.729 --> 00:05:17.909 
getting covered in the in the whitewash
and<00:05:16.060> you<00:05:16.870> don't<00:05:17.050> want<00:05:17.229> any<00:05:17.380> of<00:05:17.530> these<00:05:17.650> little

00:05:17.909 --> 00:05:17.919 
and you don't want any of these little

00:05:17.919 --> 00:05:19.260 
and you don't want any of these little
pools<00:05:18.100> left<00:05:18.520> you<00:05:18.700> want<00:05:18.850> to<00:05:18.910> make<00:05:19.030> sure<00:05:19.150> that

00:05:19.260 --> 00:05:19.270 
pools left you want to make sure that

00:05:19.270 --> 00:05:21.630 
pools left you want to make sure that
they're<00:05:19.419> all<00:05:19.570> gone<00:05:19.810> and<00:05:20.130> just<00:05:21.130> get<00:05:21.280> it<00:05:21.370> rolled

00:05:21.630 --> 00:05:21.640 
they're all gone and just get it rolled

00:05:21.640 --> 00:05:26.090 
they're all gone and just get it rolled
really<00:05:22.450> good<00:05:22.570> the<00:05:22.690> whole<00:05:22.840> strip

00:05:26.090 --> 00:05:26.100 

00:05:26.100 --> 00:05:28.950 

pretty<00:05:27.100> easy<00:05:27.280> and<00:05:27.669> it's<00:05:28.539> easier<00:05:28.840> than

00:05:28.950 --> 00:05:28.960 
pretty easy and it's easier than

00:05:28.960 --> 00:05:30.150 
pretty easy and it's easier than
painting<00:05:29.260> walks<00:05:29.500> it<00:05:29.680> doesn't<00:05:29.889> have<00:05:29.979> to<00:05:30.070> be

00:05:30.150 --> 00:05:30.160 
painting walks it doesn't have to be

00:05:30.160 --> 00:05:33.570 
painting walks it doesn't have to be
totally<00:05:30.310> perfect

00:05:33.570 --> 00:05:33.580 

00:05:33.580 --> 00:05:35.010 

and<00:05:34.090> then<00:05:34.300> of<00:05:34.420> course<00:05:34.450> I'm<00:05:34.690> doing<00:05:34.840> this<00:05:34.900> with

00:05:35.010 --> 00:05:35.020 
and then of course I'm doing this with

00:05:35.020 --> 00:05:36.720 
and then of course I'm doing this with
one<00:05:35.170> hand<00:05:35.200> in<00:05:35.530> the<00:05:35.590> camera<00:05:35.950> in<00:05:36.160> my<00:05:36.370> other<00:05:36.490> hand

00:05:36.720 --> 00:05:36.730 
one hand in the camera in my other hand

00:05:36.730 --> 00:05:38.130 
one hand in the camera in my other hand
so<00:05:36.940> I'm<00:05:37.060> not<00:05:37.180> doing<00:05:37.420> a<00:05:37.450> great<00:05:37.570> job<00:05:37.690> but

00:05:38.130 --> 00:05:38.140 
so I'm not doing a great job but

00:05:38.140 --> 00:05:41.250 
so I'm not doing a great job but
normally<00:05:39.060> doing<00:05:40.060> pretty<00:05:40.270> good<00:05:40.450> but<00:05:41.080> then

00:05:41.250 --> 00:05:41.260 
normally doing pretty good but then

00:05:41.260 --> 00:05:43.290 
normally doing pretty good but then
there's<00:05:42.160> you<00:05:42.430> know<00:05:42.460> a<00:05:42.550> couple<00:05:42.880> little<00:05:43.000> pools

00:05:43.290 --> 00:05:43.300 
there's you know a couple little pools

00:05:43.300 --> 00:05:45.660 
there's you know a couple little pools
left<00:05:43.600> over<00:05:43.870> so<00:05:44.050> what<00:05:44.290> what<00:05:44.560> I<00:05:44.590> like<00:05:44.800> to<00:05:44.890> do<00:05:45.040> is

00:05:45.660 --> 00:05:45.670 
left over so what what I like to do is

00:05:45.670 --> 00:05:47.100 
left over so what what I like to do is
just<00:05:45.910> start<00:05:46.060> at<00:05:46.150> the<00:05:46.210> end<00:05:46.360> and<00:05:46.660> then<00:05:46.810> just<00:05:46.990> do

00:05:47.100 --> 00:05:47.110 
just start at the end and then just do

00:05:47.110 --> 00:05:49.650 
just start at the end and then just do
one<00:05:47.260> final<00:05:47.470> roll<00:05:47.880> make<00:05:48.880> sure<00:05:49.030> your<00:05:49.150> roller<00:05:49.390> is

00:05:49.650 --> 00:05:49.660 
one final roll make sure your roller is

00:05:49.660 --> 00:05:53.720 
one final roll make sure your roller is
totally<00:05:50.050> covering<00:05:50.670> the<00:05:51.670> entire<00:05:51.790> thing<00:05:52.300> and

00:05:53.720 --> 00:05:53.730 
totally covering the entire thing and

00:05:53.730 --> 00:05:57.030 
totally covering the entire thing and
there<00:05:54.730> you<00:05:54.820> go<00:05:54.910> that's<00:05:55.900> it<00:05:56.080> now<00:05:56.530> we're

00:05:57.030 --> 00:05:57.040 
there you go that's it now we're

00:05:57.040 --> 00:05:57.840 
there you go that's it now we're
probably<00:05:57.130> looking<00:05:57.340> at<00:05:57.460> going<00:05:57.640> that's

00:05:57.840 --> 00:05:57.850 
probably looking at going that's

00:05:57.850 --> 00:05:59.190 
probably looking at going that's
whitewash<00:05:58.210> that<00:05:58.240> doesn't<00:05:58.720> even<00:05:58.810> look<00:05:58.990> any

00:05:59.190 --> 00:05:59.200 
whitewash that doesn't even look any

00:05:59.200 --> 00:05:59.640 
whitewash that doesn't even look any
different

00:05:59.640 --> 00:05:59.650 
different

00:05:59.650 --> 00:06:01.410 
different
trust<00:06:00.040> me<00:06:00.190> win<00:06:00.370> it<00:06:00.520> when<00:06:00.760> it<00:06:00.880> dries<00:06:01.180> it'll

00:06:01.410 --> 00:06:01.420 
trust me win it when it dries it'll

00:06:01.420 --> 00:06:02.970 
trust me win it when it dries it'll
weigh<00:06:01.780> different<00:06:02.140> I<00:06:02.230> can<00:06:02.380> actually<00:06:02.530> prove<00:06:02.830> it

00:06:02.970 --> 00:06:02.980 
weigh different I can actually prove it

00:06:02.980 --> 00:06:04.530 
weigh different I can actually prove it
to<00:06:03.070> you<00:06:03.160> right<00:06:03.220> now<00:06:03.430> I<00:06:03.670> got<00:06:03.970> a<00:06:04.000> couple<00:06:04.240> sitting

00:06:04.530 --> 00:06:04.540 
to you right now I got a couple sitting

00:06:04.540 --> 00:06:06.000 
to you right now I got a couple sitting
next<00:06:04.720> to<00:06:04.840> each<00:06:04.930> other<00:06:05.080> and<00:06:05.410> it<00:06:05.740> will<00:06:05.800> take<00:06:05.980> a

00:06:06.000 --> 00:06:06.010 
next to each other and it will take a

00:06:06.010 --> 00:06:07.140 
next to each other and it will take a
little<00:06:06.130> while<00:06:06.250> to<00:06:06.340> dry<00:06:06.550> we've<00:06:06.760> actually<00:06:06.940> been

00:06:07.140 --> 00:06:07.150 
little while to dry we've actually been

00:06:07.150 --> 00:06:09.990 
little while to dry we've actually been
letting<00:06:07.360> them<00:06:07.450> sit<00:06:07.630> for<00:06:07.690> probably<00:06:08.170> I<00:06:09.000> don't

00:06:09.990 --> 00:06:10.000 
letting them sit for probably I don't

00:06:10.000 --> 00:06:12.780 
letting them sit for probably I don't
know<00:06:10.180> several<00:06:10.480> hours<00:06:11.400> when<00:06:12.400> they're<00:06:12.490> dry<00:06:12.610> and

00:06:12.780 --> 00:06:12.790 
know several hours when they're dry and

00:06:12.790 --> 00:06:14.910 
know several hours when they're dry and
I<00:06:12.850> also<00:06:13.270> should<00:06:13.600> mention<00:06:13.720> that<00:06:14.080> what<00:06:14.680> we<00:06:14.770> did

00:06:14.910 --> 00:06:14.920 
I also should mention that what we did

00:06:14.920 --> 00:06:16.950 
I also should mention that what we did
was<00:06:15.130> we<00:06:15.280> and<00:06:15.520> it's<00:06:15.670> pretty<00:06:15.940> obvious<00:06:16.210> now<00:06:16.360> is<00:06:16.600> we

00:06:16.950 --> 00:06:16.960 
was we and it's pretty obvious now is we

00:06:16.960 --> 00:06:18.450 
was we and it's pretty obvious now is we
laid<00:06:17.140> some<00:06:17.170> two<00:06:17.440> by<00:06:17.590> fours<00:06:17.620> across<00:06:18.100> the<00:06:18.220> floor

00:06:18.450 --> 00:06:18.460 
laid some two by fours across the floor

00:06:18.460 --> 00:06:20.070 
laid some two by fours across the floor
and<00:06:18.610> what<00:06:18.970> we<00:06:19.060> do<00:06:19.180> is<00:06:19.360> we<00:06:19.540> just<00:06:19.750> stack<00:06:19.930> them

00:06:20.070 --> 00:06:20.080 
and what we do is we just stack them

00:06:20.080 --> 00:06:21.270 
and what we do is we just stack them
next<00:06:20.320> to<00:06:20.410> each<00:06:20.440> other<00:06:20.590> you<00:06:20.740> leave<00:06:21.040> a<00:06:21.070> little

00:06:21.270 --> 00:06:21.280 
next to each other you leave a little

00:06:21.280 --> 00:06:22.980 
next to each other you leave a little
space<00:06:21.520> between<00:06:21.790> them<00:06:22.090> so<00:06:22.270> you<00:06:22.360> can<00:06:22.510> roll<00:06:22.750> and

00:06:22.980 --> 00:06:22.990 
space between them so you can roll and

00:06:22.990 --> 00:06:25.050 
space between them so you can roll and
then<00:06:23.380> we<00:06:23.500> just<00:06:23.680> squeeze<00:06:23.950> them<00:06:24.070> together<00:06:24.220> so

00:06:25.050 --> 00:06:25.060 
then we just squeeze them together so

00:06:25.060 --> 00:06:26.490 
then we just squeeze them together so
you<00:06:25.090> because<00:06:25.300> means<00:06:25.540> we<00:06:25.660> can<00:06:25.840> we<00:06:26.050> actually<00:06:26.200> can

00:06:26.490 --> 00:06:26.500 
you because means we can we actually can

00:06:26.500 --> 00:06:28.650 
you because means we can we actually can
fit<00:06:26.710> in<00:06:26.890> this<00:06:27.550> room<00:06:27.730> about<00:06:27.850> thirty<00:06:28.330> year<00:06:28.570> of

00:06:28.650 --> 00:06:28.660 
fit in this room about thirty year of

00:06:28.660 --> 00:06:30.260 
fit in this room about thirty year of
them<00:06:28.780> thirty-five<00:06:29.230> something<00:06:29.560> like<00:06:29.650> that

00:06:30.260 --> 00:06:30.270 
them thirty-five something like that

00:06:30.270 --> 00:06:32.400 
them thirty-five something like that
once<00:06:31.270> it's<00:06:31.390> done<00:06:31.570> it's<00:06:31.900> going<00:06:32.080> to<00:06:32.170> look<00:06:32.290> like

00:06:32.400 --> 00:06:32.410 
once it's done it's going to look like

00:06:32.410 --> 00:06:34.470 
once it's done it's going to look like
this<00:06:32.740> once<00:06:33.160> it's<00:06:33.310> dry<00:06:33.640> and<00:06:33.970> like<00:06:34.150> I<00:06:34.240> said<00:06:34.390> we'll

00:06:34.470 --> 00:06:34.480 
this once it's dry and like I said we'll

00:06:34.480 --> 00:06:35.790 
this once it's dry and like I said we'll
take<00:06:34.600> several<00:06:34.840> hours<00:06:35.020> compare<00:06:35.560> the

00:06:35.790 --> 00:06:35.800 
take several hours compare the

00:06:35.800 --> 00:06:37.740 
take several hours compare the
difference<00:06:36.130> here<00:06:36.400> look<00:06:36.580> at<00:06:37.360> that<00:06:37.450> when<00:06:37.600> it

00:06:37.740 --> 00:06:37.750 
difference here look at that when it

00:06:37.750 --> 00:06:40.320 
difference here look at that when it
dried<00:06:38.050> it<00:06:38.260> turned<00:06:38.550> you<00:06:39.550> know<00:06:39.640> it<00:06:40.000> really

00:06:40.320 --> 00:06:40.330 
dried it turned you know it really

00:06:40.330 --> 00:06:42.450 
dried it turned you know it really
really<00:06:40.570> washed<00:06:40.810> out<00:06:41.020> and<00:06:41.320> of<00:06:41.920> course<00:06:42.130> like<00:06:42.340> I

00:06:42.450 --> 00:06:42.460 
really washed out and of course like I

00:06:42.460 --> 00:06:44.280 
really washed out and of course like I
said<00:06:42.640> that's<00:06:42.760> that's<00:06:43.150> close<00:06:43.510> to<00:06:43.840> a<00:06:43.870> two<00:06:44.110> to<00:06:44.260> one

00:06:44.280 --> 00:06:44.290 
said that's that's close to a two to one

00:06:44.290 --> 00:06:46.320 
said that's that's close to a two to one
which<00:06:44.620> is<00:06:44.830> only<00:06:44.980> you<00:06:45.700> know<00:06:45.730> two<00:06:45.940> parts<00:06:46.180> water

00:06:46.320 --> 00:06:46.330 
which is only you know two parts water

00:06:46.330 --> 00:06:47.760 
which is only you know two parts water
one<00:06:46.630> part<00:06:46.780> paint<00:06:47.200> if<00:06:47.290> you<00:06:47.350> don't<00:06:47.530> want<00:06:47.680> it

00:06:47.760 --> 00:06:47.770 
one part paint if you don't want it

00:06:47.770 --> 00:06:49.230 
one part paint if you don't want it
quite<00:06:47.890> that<00:06:48.190> light<00:06:48.430> then<00:06:48.700> you<00:06:48.820> could<00:06:48.970> go

00:06:49.230 --> 00:06:49.240 
quite that light then you could go

00:06:49.240 --> 00:06:51.660 
quite that light then you could go
higher<00:06:49.480> maybe<00:06:49.810> three<00:06:50.110> or<00:06:50.140> four<00:06:50.260> to<00:06:50.740> one<00:06:50.890> if<00:06:51.580> you

00:06:51.660 --> 00:06:51.670 
higher maybe three or four to one if you

00:06:51.670 --> 00:06:53.400 
higher maybe three or four to one if you
want<00:06:51.820> it<00:06:51.880> dark<00:06:52.090> the<00:06:52.210> one<00:06:52.660> one<00:06:52.870> but<00:06:53.260> basically

00:06:53.400 --> 00:06:53.410 
want it dark the one one but basically

00:06:53.410 --> 00:06:55.860 
want it dark the one one but basically
you're<00:06:53.800> basically<00:06:54.070> painting<00:06:54.430> it<00:06:54.550> by<00:06:54.700> then<00:06:54.880> but

00:06:55.860 --> 00:06:55.870 
you're basically painting it by then but

00:06:55.870 --> 00:06:57.000 
you're basically painting it by then but
yeah<00:06:56.020> just<00:06:56.230> check<00:06:56.380> out<00:06:56.470> the<00:06:56.560> difference<00:06:56.830> there

00:06:57.000 --> 00:06:57.010 
yeah just check out the difference there

00:06:57.010 --> 00:06:58.530 
yeah just check out the difference there
between<00:06:57.130> the<00:06:57.550> raw<00:06:57.730> plywood<00:06:58.240> and<00:06:58.450> the

00:06:58.530 --> 00:06:58.540 
between the raw plywood and the

00:06:58.540 --> 00:07:00.570 
between the raw plywood and the
whitewashed<00:06:58.960> and<00:06:59.230> then<00:06:59.860> of<00:07:00.100> course<00:07:00.310> like<00:07:00.460> I

00:07:00.570 --> 00:07:00.580 
whitewashed and then of course like I

00:07:00.580 --> 00:07:02.430 
whitewashed and then of course like I
said<00:07:00.610> right<00:07:00.910> here<00:07:01.180> is<00:07:01.450> in<00:07:01.600> between<00:07:01.690> when<00:07:02.290> it's

00:07:02.430 --> 00:07:02.440 
said right here is in between when it's

00:07:02.440 --> 00:07:06.750 
said right here is in between when it's
just<00:07:02.680> wet<00:07:02.920> it's<00:07:03.040> not<00:07:03.220> dry<00:07:03.550> yet<00:07:03.790> so<00:07:05.550> pretty<00:07:06.550> easy

00:07:06.750 --> 00:07:06.760 
just wet it's not dry yet so pretty easy

00:07:06.760 --> 00:07:08.790 
just wet it's not dry yet so pretty easy
to<00:07:07.000> do<00:07:07.120> now<00:07:07.330> another<00:07:07.720> thing<00:07:07.810> maybe<00:07:08.470> you<00:07:08.650> think

00:07:08.790 --> 00:07:08.800 
to do now another thing maybe you think

00:07:08.800 --> 00:07:11.640 
to do now another thing maybe you think
that's<00:07:09.100> a<00:07:09.280> little<00:07:09.370> too<00:07:09.520> too<00:07:10.240> washed<00:07:10.510> out<00:07:10.780> but

00:07:11.640 --> 00:07:11.650 
that's a little too too washed out but

00:07:11.650 --> 00:07:13.500 
that's a little too too washed out but
when<00:07:12.130> these<00:07:12.280> are<00:07:12.460> all<00:07:12.610> installed<00:07:13.090> and<00:07:13.330> they're

00:07:13.500 --> 00:07:13.510 
when these are all installed and they're

00:07:13.510 --> 00:07:14.790 
when these are all installed and they're
going<00:07:13.630> to<00:07:13.690> actually<00:07:13.870> be<00:07:14.080> installed<00:07:14.410> in<00:07:14.530> four

00:07:14.790 --> 00:07:14.800 
going to actually be installed in four

00:07:14.800 --> 00:07:15.960 
going to actually be installed in four
like<00:07:14.950> this<00:07:15.160> just<00:07:15.370> right<00:07:15.520> next<00:07:15.730> to<00:07:15.790> each<00:07:15.880> other

00:07:15.960 --> 00:07:15.970 
like this just right next to each other

00:07:15.970 --> 00:07:18.810 
like this just right next to each other
just<00:07:16.240> a<00:07:16.360> little<00:07:16.390> bit<00:07:16.810> of<00:07:16.900> gap<00:07:17.220> then<00:07:18.220> when<00:07:18.610> it's

00:07:18.810 --> 00:07:18.820 
just a little bit of gap then when it's

00:07:18.820 --> 00:07:21.240 
just a little bit of gap then when it's
all<00:07:18.970> in<00:07:19.090> stored<00:07:19.330> when<00:07:20.290> it's<00:07:20.440> all<00:07:20.590> installed

00:07:21.240 --> 00:07:21.250 
all in stored when it's all installed

00:07:21.250 --> 00:07:23.280 
all in stored when it's all installed
like<00:07:21.430> a<00:07:21.460> regular<00:07:21.640> flooring<00:07:22.120> then<00:07:23.050> we're<00:07:23.170> going

00:07:23.280 --> 00:07:23.290 
like a regular flooring then we're going

00:07:23.290 --> 00:07:25.500 
like a regular flooring then we're going
to<00:07:23.320> put<00:07:23.620> the<00:07:23.920> polyurethane<00:07:24.640> on<00:07:25.030> it's<00:07:25.270> actually

00:07:25.500 --> 00:07:25.510 
to put the polyurethane on it's actually

00:07:25.510 --> 00:07:26.910
