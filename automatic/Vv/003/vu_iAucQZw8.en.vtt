00:01:32.690 --> 00:01:32.700 
there is there was this planet set which

00:01:32.700 --> 00:01:35.450 
there is there was this planet set which
showed<00:01:33.030> up<00:01:33.210> grand<00:01:33.869> privilege<00:01:34.380> over<00:01:34.680> the<00:01:35.159> look

00:01:35.450 --> 00:01:35.460 
showed up grand privilege over the look

00:01:35.460 --> 00:01:38.359 
showed up grand privilege over the look
and<00:01:35.759> figure<00:01:36.450> on<00:01:36.990> each<00:01:37.380> wing<00:01:37.590> bought<00:01:37.799> cloud<00:01:38.070> car

00:01:38.359 --> 00:01:38.369 
and figure on each wing bought cloud car

00:01:38.369 --> 00:01:42.980 
and figure on each wing bought cloud car
so<00:01:38.640> yeah<00:01:39.530> so<00:01:40.530> if<00:01:41.159> you<00:01:41.310> guys<00:01:41.450> can't<00:01:42.450> wait<00:01:42.720> to<00:01:42.869> get

00:01:42.980 --> 00:01:42.990 
so yeah so if you guys can't wait to get

00:01:42.990 --> 00:01:45.410 
so yeah so if you guys can't wait to get
an<00:01:43.290> actual<00:01:43.500> version<00:01:43.920> and<00:01:44.310> you<00:01:45.000> don't<00:01:45.210> want<00:01:45.360> to

00:01:45.410 --> 00:01:45.420 
an actual version and you don't want to

00:01:45.420 --> 00:01:47.480 
an actual version and you don't want to
search<00:01:45.990> for<00:01:46.020> the<00:01:46.409> older<00:01:46.710> one<00:01:46.890> then<00:01:47.100> I<00:01:47.250> think

00:01:47.480 --> 00:01:47.490 
search for the older one then I think

00:01:47.490 --> 00:01:50.749 
search for the older one then I think
it's<00:01:47.700> still<00:01:47.939> buy<00:01:48.090> that<00:01:48.299> I<00:01:48.570> don't<00:01:48.780> know<00:01:49.759> for

00:01:50.749 --> 00:01:50.759 
it's still buy that I don't know for

00:01:50.759 --> 00:01:54.289 
it's still buy that I don't know for
another<00:01:51.060> one<00:01:51.420> of<00:01:51.509> the<00:01:51.740> cheaper<00:01:52.740> sets<00:01:53.090> it<00:01:54.090> would

00:01:54.289 --> 00:01:54.299 
another one of the cheaper sets it would

00:01:54.299 --> 00:01:57.109 
another one of the cheaper sets it would
be<00:01:54.470> another<00:01:55.470> tie<00:01:55.770> interceptor<00:01:56.399> or<00:01:56.640> type<00:01:56.880> off

00:01:57.109 --> 00:01:57.119 
be another tie interceptor or type off

00:01:57.119 --> 00:02:01.639 
be another tie interceptor or type off
or<00:01:57.360> I<00:01:57.420> don't<00:01:57.479> know<00:01:57.689> I<00:01:59.509> put<00:02:00.509> one<00:02:01.380> of<00:02:01.469> these<00:02:01.590> on

00:02:01.639 --> 00:02:01.649 
or I don't know I put one of these on

00:02:01.649 --> 00:02:03.870 
or I don't know I put one of these on
for<00:02:02.250> these<00:02:02.520> entry

00:02:03.870 --> 00:02:03.880 
for these entry

00:02:03.880 --> 00:02:08.130 
for these entry
and<00:02:04.240> chipsets<00:02:05.729> range<00:02:06.729> I'm<00:02:07.090> guessing<00:02:07.780> them<00:02:07.990> I

00:02:08.130 --> 00:02:08.140 
and chipsets range I'm guessing them I

00:02:08.140 --> 00:02:11.160 
and chipsets range I'm guessing them I
mean<00:02:08.349> I've<00:02:09.099> seen<00:02:09.340> a<00:02:09.399> lot<00:02:09.459> of<00:02:09.550> custom<00:02:10.170> x

00:02:11.160 --> 00:02:11.170 
mean I've seen a lot of custom x

00:02:11.170 --> 00:02:14.699 
mean I've seen a lot of custom x
receptors<00:02:11.680> and<00:02:12.269> there<00:02:13.269> are<00:02:13.560> exactly<00:02:14.560> the<00:02:14.680> same

00:02:14.699 --> 00:02:14.709 
receptors and there are exactly the same

00:02:14.709 --> 00:02:16.710 
receptors and there are exactly the same
style<00:02:15.250> as<00:02:15.519> we've<00:02:15.760> had<00:02:15.940> the<00:02:16.180> TIE<00:02:16.420> fighter

00:02:16.710 --> 00:02:16.720 
style as we've had the TIE fighter

00:02:16.720 --> 00:02:19.440 
style as we've had the TIE fighter
recently<00:02:17.200> so<00:02:17.650> on<00:02:17.920> I<00:02:18.250> think<00:02:19.150> that<00:02:19.269> they<00:02:19.360> can

00:02:19.440 --> 00:02:19.450 
recently so on I think that they can

00:02:19.450 --> 00:02:22.559 
recently so on I think that they can
make<00:02:19.510> a<00:02:19.690> 50-buck<00:02:20.170> set<00:02:20.500> out<00:02:20.680> of<00:02:20.800> that<00:02:20.950> um<00:02:21.569> ship

00:02:22.559 --> 00:02:22.569 
make a 50-buck set out of that um ship

00:02:22.569 --> 00:02:24.900 
make a 50-buck set out of that um ship

otherwise<00:02:50.380> i<00:02:50.560> think<00:02:50.739> was<00:02:50.890> in<00:02:51.010> two<00:02:51.130> thousand

00:02:51.539 --> 00:02:51.549 
otherwise i think was in two thousand

00:02:51.549 --> 00:02:54.509 
otherwise i think was in two thousand
and<00:02:52.200> I'd<00:02:53.200> like<00:02:53.410> to<00:02:53.560> see<00:02:53.680> like<00:02:53.799> an<00:02:53.950> intermediate

00:02:54.509 --> 00:02:54.519 
and I'd like to see like an intermediate

00:02:54.519 --> 00:02:58.350 
and I'd like to see like an intermediate
version<00:02:54.700> of<00:02:54.940> both<00:02:55.120> of<00:02:55.150> those<00:02:55.390> so<00:02:55.930> yeah<00:02:57.000> next<00:02:58.000> we

00:02:58.350 --> 00:02:58.360 
version of both of those so yeah next we

00:02:58.360 --> 00:03:03.360 
version of both of those so yeah next we
have<00:02:58.480> the<00:02:59.489> d-type<00:03:00.489> umbria<00:03:01.319> we<00:03:02.319> had<00:03:02.470> a<00:03:02.709> a<00:03:03.040> planet

00:03:03.360 --> 00:03:03.370 
have the d-type umbria we had a a planet

00:03:03.370 --> 00:03:05.850 
have the d-type umbria we had a a planet
version<00:03:03.610> of<00:03:03.700> the<00:03:03.819> easiest<00:03:04.120> which<00:03:04.630> I<00:03:04.870> came<00:03:05.650> out

version of the easiest which I came out
okay<00:03:06.519> i<00:03:06.549> guess<00:03:06.880> it<00:03:07.090> was<00:03:07.120> a<00:03:07.209> major<00:03:07.480> urban<00:03:07.660> and

00:03:08.610 --> 00:03:08.620 
okay i guess it was a major urban and

00:03:08.620 --> 00:03:11.069 
okay i guess it was a major urban and
here<00:03:09.190> we<00:03:09.310> have<00:03:09.340> the<00:03:09.549> actual<00:03:09.700> set<00:03:10.239> it<00:03:10.780> doesn't

00:04:37.010 --> 00:04:39.040 
we came out since nobody buy it at the
beginning<00:04:37.160> it<00:04:37.580> they<00:04:37.970> stopped<00:04:38.240> producing<00:04:38.720> it

and left the few ones they made on the
sale<00:04:42.950> you<00:04:43.220> remember<00:04:43.669> so<00:04:43.910> yeah<00:04:44.090> I<00:04:44.390> said<00:04:44.900> I

00:04:44.920 --> 00:04:44.930 
sale you remember so yeah I said I

wasn't<00:04:45.169> too<00:04:45.470> well<00:04:45.680> I<00:04:45.710> think<00:04:45.950> they<00:04:46.850> should

00:04:46.990 --> 00:04:47.000 
wasn't too well I think they should

00:04:47.000 --> 00:04:48.880 
wasn't too well I think they should
remake<00:04:47.300> it<00:04:47.479> we<00:04:47.570> could<00:04:47.720> be<00:04:47.870> on<00:04:48.020> this<00:04:48.200> that<00:04:48.590> set

00:04:48.880 --> 00:04:48.890 
remake it we could be on this that set

00:04:48.890 --> 00:04:50.920 
remake it we could be on this that set
because<00:04:49.190> a<00:04:49.370> ton<00:04:49.729> of<00:04:49.760> multi<00:04:50.150> resets<00:04:50.510> the<00:04:50.720> body

00:04:50.920 --> 00:04:50.930 
because a ton of multi resets the body

00:04:50.930 --> 00:04:55.390 
because a ton of multi resets the body
on<00:04:51.729> and<00:04:52.729> at<00:04:53.419> last<00:04:54.229> there<00:04:54.650> is<00:04:54.770> no<00:04:54.979> leg<00:04:55.160> of<00:04:55.310> a
