00:00:00.110 --> 00:00:05.009
 good evening and welcome to 

00:00:02.460 --> 00:00:07.440
 weather was very hot today and that in 

00:00:05.009 --> 00:00:10.200
 to share with Germany 

00:00:07.440 --> 00:00:12.480
 Baden-württemberg 36 degrees Neukirchen 

00:00:10.200 --> 00:00:14.190
 vluyn in north rhine-westphalia 35 7 

00:00:12.480 --> 00:00:18.990
 just like you wrestle and bad nauheim 

00:00:14.190 --> 00:00:20.850
 weiltingen chamber 35 6 degrees and worms 35 

00:00:18.990 --> 00:00:23.310
 4 degrees and the air was already today 

00:00:20.850 --> 00:00:25.830
 but some students around us 

00:00:23.310 --> 00:00:27.150
 It is very hot at the moment that is 

00:00:25.830 --> 00:00:29.550
 also for those who want to drive away 

00:00:27.150 --> 00:00:31.949
 at least because of the high temperatures 

00:00:29.550 --> 00:00:33.960
 you do not have to do that you see here 

00:00:31.949 --> 00:00:35.280
 this dark red tongue up in the 

00:00:33.960 --> 00:00:38.250
 west and northwest of germany 

00:00:35.280 --> 00:00:40.079
 that's just the 30 to 35 degrees 

00:00:38.250 --> 00:00:42.510
 we also have them in the south in 

00:00:40.079 --> 00:00:44.250
 southern france or south spain 

00:00:42.510 --> 00:00:46.350
 even around the 38 degrees 

00:00:44.250 --> 00:00:48.079
 it looks similar on the balearen 

00:00:46.350 --> 00:00:51.960
 also in the eastern mediterranean sea 

00:00:48.079 --> 00:00:54.390
 maximum temperatures around 36 degrees tomorrow 

00:00:51.960 --> 00:00:56.190
 in addition the water temperatures that cools 

00:00:54.390 --> 00:00:59.969
 not always so really in front of everything 

00:00:56.190 --> 00:01:01.350
 directly on land are around 27 degrees in the 

00:00:59.969 --> 00:01:03.840
 mediterranean that means the further you go then 

00:01:01.350 --> 00:01:06.600
 comes out the open sea the more 

00:01:03.840 --> 00:01:10.409
 less warm, of course, biskaya 23 

00:01:06.600 --> 00:01:12.060
 grad north sea and baltic sea 21 to 22 degrees 

00:01:10.409 --> 00:01:14.189
 then you can be more of a jump 

00:01:12.060 --> 00:01:15.810
 to talk in the cool wet 

00:01:14.189 --> 00:01:17.189
 and you could do that in today as well 

00:01:15.810 --> 00:01:18.630
 germany will be there in the 

00:01:17.189 --> 00:01:19.229
 Run in the afternoon and chill 

00:01:18.630 --> 00:01:21.180
 thunderstorm 

00:01:19.229 --> 00:01:23.009
 first cloudless sky this morning 

00:01:21.180 --> 00:01:25.110
 then you already see over here 

00:01:23.009 --> 00:01:27.330
 Black Forest developed in part 

00:01:25.110 --> 00:01:28.619
 really thick thunderclouds especially 

00:01:27.330 --> 00:01:30.240
 west of us where the air is still 

00:01:28.619 --> 00:01:31.290
 is much wetter and that flows 

00:01:30.240 --> 00:01:32.220
 slowly but surely after 

00:01:31.290 --> 00:01:34.110
 Germany 

00:01:32.220 --> 00:01:36.720
 also in the direction of North Rhine-Westphalia in 

00:01:34.110 --> 00:01:38.759
 The Eifel Rhineland Palatinate was everywhere 

00:01:36.720 --> 00:01:40.560

 bergland be the case and on wednesday 

00:01:42.930 --> 00:01:47.820
 we get those in the southwestern half 

00:01:44.840 --> 00:01:49.740
 spreads and that means it feels 

00:01:47.820 --> 00:01:52.470
 Stay a little longer because 

00:01:49.740 --> 00:01:54.420
 it will just give even humid air 

00:01:52.470 --> 00:01:57.090
 and because it is still much heavier 

00:01:54.420 --> 00:01:58.710
 will have it at night now 

00:01:57.090 --> 00:02:00.600
 with a few showers and thunderstorms 

00:01:58.710 --> 00:02:01.590
 above all things to the west and to do 

00:02:00.600 --> 00:02:03.270
 southwest 

00:02:01.590 --> 00:02:05.040
 they move on a bit further 

00:02:03.270 --> 00:02:07.409
 the east will fall more and more in 

00:02:05.040 --> 00:02:09.810
 Total together north and 

00:02:07.409 --> 00:02:11.660
 east towards dry air accordingly 

00:02:09.810 --> 00:02:13.220
