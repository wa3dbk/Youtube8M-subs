00:01:55.799 --> 00:01:58.459 
a random player I got in one of my packs
and<00:01:56.100> as<00:01:56.759> you<00:01:56.880> can<00:01:57.000> see<00:01:57.030> there<00:01:57.420> you<00:01:57.659> know<00:01:57.810> his

00:01:58.459 --> 00:01:58.469 
and as you can see there you know his

00:01:58.469 --> 00:02:01.219 
and as you can see there you know his
price<00:01:58.740> at<00:01:58.920> the<00:01:58.979> moment<00:01:59.310> is<00:01:59.399> around<00:01:59.850> 700<00:02:00.570> to<00:02:00.659> 850

00:02:01.219 --> 00:02:01.229

00:02:01.229 --> 00:02:02.990 
price at the moment is around 700 to 850
I<00:02:01.259> think<00:02:01.530> give<00:02:01.860> or<00:02:01.890> take<00:02:02.009> is<00:02:02.280> about<00:02:02.579> his<00:02:02.759> price

00:02:02.990 --> 00:02:03.000 
I think give or take is about his price

00:02:03.000 --> 00:02:05.660 
I think give or take is about his price
but<00:02:03.509> it's<00:02:03.630> one<00:02:03.750> there<00:02:03.960> for<00:02:04.079> 450<00:02:05.009> so<00:02:05.280> I<00:02:05.310> was<00:02:05.490> like

00:02:05.660 --> 00:02:05.670 
but it's one there for 450 so I was like

00:02:05.670 --> 00:02:08.180 
but it's one there for 450 so I was like
we'll<00:02:06.540> go<00:02:06.719> and<00:02:06.899> buy<00:02:07.049> that<00:02:07.259> one<00:02:07.469> and<00:02:07.740> then<00:02:08.009> put

00:02:08.180 --> 00:02:08.190 
we'll go and buy that one and then put

00:02:08.190 --> 00:02:10.550 
we'll go and buy that one and then put
it<00:02:08.280> out<00:02:08.399> for<00:02:08.670> around<00:02:08.970> 650<00:02:09.599> to<00:02:09.780> get<00:02:09.929> it<00:02:10.050> sold<00:02:10.259> so

00:02:10.550 --> 00:02:10.560

that's<00:02:10.739> exactly<00:02:11.190> what<00:02:11.430> I<00:02:11.459> did<00:02:11.550> I<00:02:11.970> went<00:02:12.390> on<00:02:12.540> to

00:02:12.800 --> 00:02:12.810 
that's exactly what I did I went on to

00:02:12.810 --> 00:02:13.520 
that's exactly what I did I went on to
my<00:02:13.200> web

00:02:13.520 --> 00:02:13.530 
my web

00:02:13.530 --> 00:02:16.610 
my web
as<00:02:13.830> you<00:02:13.980> can<00:02:14.069> see<00:02:14.250> here<00:02:14.459> and<00:02:14.640> i<00:02:14.730> bought<00:02:15.060> the<00:02:15.620> 451

00:02:16.610 --> 00:02:16.620 
as you can see here and i bought the 451

00:02:16.620 --> 00:02:19.790 
as you can see here and i bought the 451
as<00:02:16.920> you<00:02:17.340> can<00:02:17.430> see<00:02:17.580> i<00:02:17.610> did<00:02:17.850> a<00:02:17.880> 700<00:02:18.569> minimum<00:02:19.140> and

00:02:19.790 --> 00:02:19.800 
as you can see i did a 700 minimum and

00:02:19.800 --> 00:02:21.410 
as you can see i did a 700 minimum and
those<00:02:20.250> were<00:02:20.430> the<00:02:20.550> only<00:02:20.640> two<00:02:20.790> obviously

00:02:21.410 --> 00:02:21.420 
those were the only two obviously

00:02:21.420 --> 00:02:23.809 
those were the only two obviously
because<00:02:21.690> it<00:02:21.810> was<00:02:21.930> only<00:02:22.110> one<00:02:22.410> above<00:02:23.130> that<00:02:23.280> 700

00:02:23.809 --> 00:02:23.819 
because it was only one above that 700

00:02:23.819 --> 00:02:26.570 
because it was only one above that 700
so<00:02:24.630> i<00:02:24.660> bought<00:02:24.900> the<00:02:24.990> 451<00:02:25.590> and<00:02:25.980> then<00:02:26.190> i<00:02:26.220> went<00:02:26.430> to

00:02:26.570 --> 00:02:26.580 
so i bought the 451 and then i went to

00:02:26.580 --> 00:02:29.240 
so i bought the 451 and then i went to
put<00:02:26.760> it<00:02:26.850> up<00:02:26.940> for<00:02:27.120> 650<00:02:27.959> this<00:02:28.560> isn't<00:02:28.890> the<00:02:28.980> best

00:02:29.240 --> 00:02:29.250 
put it up for 650 this isn't the best

00:02:29.250 --> 00:02:31.729 
put it up for 650 this isn't the best
example<00:02:29.970> but<00:02:30.270> it<00:02:30.660> was<00:02:30.780> a<00:02:30.810> quick<00:02:31.050> example<00:02:31.410> that

00:02:31.729 --> 00:02:31.739

to sell and I it took me a lot quicker

00:03:06.510 --> 00:03:09.290 
to sell and I it took me a lot quicker
using<00:03:07.319> this<00:03:07.410> foot<00:03:07.620> wizard<00:03:08.160> you<00:03:08.640> know<00:03:08.760> little

00:03:09.290 --> 00:03:09.300 
using this foot wizard you know little

00:03:09.300 --> 00:03:11.059 
using this foot wizard you know little
method<00:03:09.720> rather<00:03:10.050> than<00:03:10.290> doing<00:03:10.500> it<00:03:10.650> manually

00:03:11.059 --> 00:03:11.069 
method rather than doing it manually

00:03:11.069 --> 00:03:12.710 
method rather than doing it manually
because<00:03:11.250> I<00:03:11.430> did<00:03:11.580> try<00:03:11.790> both<00:03:12.000> methods<00:03:12.300> and

00:03:12.710 --> 00:03:12.720 
because I did try both methods and

00:03:12.720 --> 00:03:15.380 
because I did try both methods and
manually<00:03:13.350> took<00:03:13.620> far<00:03:14.310> longer<00:03:14.340> than<00:03:14.880> this<00:03:15.120> dead

00:03:15.380 --> 00:03:15.390 
manually took far longer than this dead

00:03:15.390 --> 00:03:17.090 
manually took far longer than this dead
so<00:03:15.600> this<00:03:15.810> is<00:03:15.930> definitely<00:03:16.110> the<00:03:16.410> best<00:03:16.620> method

00:03:17.090 --> 00:03:17.100 
so this is definitely the best method

00:03:17.100 --> 00:03:18.590 
so this is definitely the best method
and<00:03:17.280> it<00:03:17.579> could<00:03:17.760> be<00:03:17.790> really<00:03:18.060> good<00:03:18.150> for<00:03:18.360> trading

00:03:18.590 --> 00:03:18.600 
and it could be really good for trading

00:03:18.600 --> 00:03:20.150 
and it could be really good for trading
as<00:03:18.750> you<00:03:18.900> can<00:03:19.019> see<00:03:19.170> here<00:03:19.410> probably<00:03:19.709> do<00:03:19.980> it<00:03:20.010> on

00:03:20.150 --> 00:03:20.160 
as you can see here probably do it on

00:03:20.160 --> 00:03:22.250 
as you can see here probably do it on
better<00:03:20.400> players<00:03:20.760> but<00:03:21.390> I<00:03:21.420> think<00:03:21.780> this<00:03:21.989> could<00:03:22.170> be

00:03:22.250 --> 00:03:22.260 
better players but I think this could be

00:03:22.260 --> 00:03:23.690 
better players but I think this could be
