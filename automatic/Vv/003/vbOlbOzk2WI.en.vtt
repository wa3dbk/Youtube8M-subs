whoa that's quite a workout there oh you
know<00:01:10.799> if<00:01:10.920> you<00:01:11.010> have<00:01:11.100> faster<00:01:11.580> hands<00:01:11.790> in<00:01:12.000> me<00:01:12.150> you

00:01:12.320 --> 00:01:12.330 
know if you have faster hands in me you

00:01:12.330 --> 00:01:15.020 
know if you have faster hands in me you
might<00:01:12.479> be<00:01:12.630> able<00:01:12.840> to<00:01:12.930> get<00:01:13.140> it<00:01:13.260> to<00:01:14.000> 2.5<00:01:15.000> or

00:01:15.020 --> 00:01:15.030 
might be able to get it to 2.5 or

00:01:15.030 --> 00:01:17.960 
might be able to get it to 2.5 or
something<00:01:15.659> but<00:01:15.930> anyway<00:01:16.110> that's<00:01:16.560> the<00:01:16.860> max<00:01:17.130> i've

00:01:17.960 --> 00:01:17.970 
something but anyway that's the max i've

00:01:17.970 --> 00:01:21.380 
something but anyway that's the max i've
been<00:01:18.210> able<00:01:18.330> to<00:01:18.479> find<00:01:18.570> is<00:01:19.110> 2.0<00:01:19.920> cpu<00:01:20.490> and<00:01:20.759> this<00:01:21.210> is

00:01:21.380 --> 00:01:21.390 
been able to find is 2.0 cpu and this is

00:01:21.390 --> 00:01:23.990 
been able to find is 2.0 cpu and this is
a<00:01:21.420> dual<00:01:21.720> core<00:01:22.049> machine<00:01:22.610> i'm<00:01:23.610> gonna<00:01:23.759> show<00:01:23.939> you

00:01:23.990 --> 00:01:24.000 
a dual core machine i'm gonna show you

00:01:24.000 --> 00:01:28.160 
a dual core machine i'm gonna show you
the<00:01:24.090> specs<00:01:25.280> 3.0<00:01:26.280> 6<00:01:26.729> gigahertz<00:01:27.119> this<00:01:27.540> is<00:01:27.689> early

00:01:28.160 --> 00:01:28.170 
the specs 3.0 6 gigahertz this is early

00:01:28.170 --> 00:01:31.700 
the specs 3.0 6 gigahertz this is early
2009<00:01:28.770> so<00:01:29.090> imac<00:01:30.090> so<00:01:30.299> I<00:01:30.329> don't<00:01:30.570> know<00:01:30.689> if<00:01:31.500> you<00:01:31.619> have

00:01:31.700 --> 00:01:31.710 
2009 so imac so I don't know if you have

00:01:31.710 --> 00:01:33.080 
2009 so imac so I don't know if you have
a<00:01:31.770> quad<00:01:32.009> core<00:01:32.250> machine<00:01:32.579> it<00:01:32.729> probably<00:01:33.000> will

00:01:33.080 --> 00:01:33.090 
a quad core machine it probably will

00:01:33.090 --> 00:01:35.600 
a quad core machine it probably will
have<00:01:33.180> much<00:01:33.479> less<00:01:33.750> percentage<00:01:34.470> in<00:01:34.979> theory

00:01:35.600 --> 00:01:35.610 
have much less percentage in theory

00:01:35.610 --> 00:01:38.719 
have much less percentage in theory
theoretically<00:01:36.920> when<00:01:37.920> I<00:01:37.950> set<00:01:38.159> it<00:01:38.250> to<00:01:38.280> slow

00:01:38.719 --> 00:01:38.729 
theoretically when I set it to slow

00:01:38.729 --> 00:01:43.600 
theoretically when I set it to slow
right<00:01:38.759> here<00:01:40.009> like<00:01:41.009> even<00:01:41.790> if<00:01:41.880> I<00:01:41.970> have<00:01:42.119> this<00:01:42.270> fast

00:01:43.600 --> 00:01:43.610 
right here like even if I have this fast

00:01:43.610 --> 00:01:47.260 
right here like even if I have this fast
it's<00:01:44.610> still<00:01:44.939> doesn't<00:01:45.420> affect<00:01:45.720> it<00:01:45.899> at<00:01:46.530> all

00:01:47.260 --> 00:01:47.270 
it's still doesn't affect it at all

00:01:47.270 --> 00:01:51.980 
it's still doesn't affect it at all
that's<00:01:48.270> kind<00:01:49.049> of<00:01:49.110> interesting

00:01:51.980 --> 00:01:51.990 

00:01:51.990 --> 00:01:58.740 

like<00:01:52.990> I<00:01:53.109> mean<00:01:53.229> it<00:01:53.380> feels<00:01:53.700> way<00:01:54.700> too<00:01:54.729> slow<00:01:57.750> you

00:01:58.740 --> 00:01:58.750 
like I mean it feels way too slow you

00:01:58.750 --> 00:02:02.069 
like I mean it feels way too slow you
know<00:01:58.869> um<00:01:59.439> it's<00:02:00.399> not<00:02:01.119> a<00:02:01.179> bad<00:02:01.420> it's<00:02:01.750> not<00:02:01.840> a<00:02:01.899> bad

00:02:02.069 --> 00:02:02.079 
know um it's not a bad it's not a bad

00:02:02.079 --> 00:02:04.980 
know um it's not a bad it's not a bad
piece<00:02:02.259> of<00:02:02.439> software<00:02:02.799> I<00:02:02.920> gotta<00:02:03.159> say<00:02:03.780> it's<00:02:04.780> not

00:02:04.980 --> 00:02:04.990 
piece of software I gotta say it's not

00:02:04.990 --> 00:02:06.679 
piece of software I gotta say it's not
bad

00:02:06.679 --> 00:02:06.689 
bad

00:02:06.689 --> 00:02:10.529 
bad
what<00:02:07.689> I<00:02:07.719> recommend<00:02:07.990> installing<00:02:08.619> it<00:02:09.360> I'm<00:02:10.360> not

00:02:10.529 --> 00:02:10.539 
what I recommend installing it I'm not

00:02:10.539 --> 00:02:12.750 
what I recommend installing it I'm not
sure<00:02:10.599> do<00:02:11.590> you<00:02:11.680> really<00:02:11.980> care<00:02:12.190> about<00:02:12.250> Mouse

00:02:12.750 --> 00:02:12.760 
sure do you really care about Mouse
