 welcome listeners today we 

00:00:02.850 --> 00:00:13.160
 we pass the forecast for the week starting from 

00:00:07.130 --> 00:00:18.289
 met march to march 29th 2015 this 

00:00:13.160 --> 00:00:24.210
 week will be 

00:00:18.289 --> 00:00:27.300
 counting for many of you that is possible 

00:00:24.210 --> 00:00:32.130
 name the state this week and 

00:00:27.300 --> 00:00:36.950
 next few weeks 0 . 0. this 

00:00:32.130 --> 00:00:41.399
 means that many 

00:00:36.950 --> 00:00:44.160
 activities in your life have come to 

00:00:41.399 --> 00:00:48.090
 completion status and 

00:00:44.160 --> 00:00:53.070
 in order to reach a new level 

00:00:48.090 --> 00:00:56.940
 development needs to start from scratch if 

00:00:53.070 --> 00:01:01.350
 something is not finished and is 

00:00:56.940 --> 00:01:03.840
 condition can be said approach to the end 

00:01:01.350 --> 00:01:05.780
 this relationship is some kind of 

00:01:03.840 --> 00:01:10.070
 professional activity is 

00:01:05.780 --> 00:01:12.600
 maybe your inner state then 

00:01:10.070 --> 00:01:15.780
 you need to do this as you can 

00:01:12.600 --> 00:01:20.369
 quicker to clear all 

00:01:15.780 --> 00:01:25.860
 what prevents you from starting to build new ones 

00:01:20.369 --> 00:01:28.170
 I am but the future is a new relationship 

00:01:25.860 --> 00:01:31.590
 career and so on and also new 

00:01:28.170 --> 00:01:35.000
 self-understanding in this 

00:01:31.590 --> 00:01:38.790
 space space itself begins 

00:01:35.000 --> 00:01:42.030
 line up like you 

00:01:38.790 --> 00:01:45.210
 may notice that people are becoming 

00:01:42.030 --> 00:01:47.640
 somewhat different what if the person who 

00:01:45.210 --> 00:01:49.610
 used to be aggressive he starts on 

00:01:47.640 --> 00:01:52.649
 all respond 

00:01:49.610 --> 00:01:54.630
 completely different on and vice versa people 

00:01:52.649 --> 00:01:57.329
 who were nice had them 

00:01:54.630 --> 00:01:59.520
 become the opposite possible 

00:01:57.329 --> 00:02:01.439
 annoyed 

00:01:59.520 --> 00:02:04.429
 Here such changes will occur 

00:02:01.439 --> 00:02:10.190
 mainly on the emotional level of people 

00:02:04.429 --> 00:02:13.440
 besides organizations that are 

00:02:10.190 --> 00:02:14.580
 somehow minimal egregor in these 

00:02:13.440 --> 00:02:16.500
 organizations 

00:02:14.580 --> 00:02:18.330
 it could be school it could be 

00:02:16.500 --> 00:02:21.090
 state day it may be 

00:02:18.330 --> 00:02:23.129
 companies are both private and 

00:02:21.090 --> 00:02:28.049
 public it could be schools 

00:02:23.129 --> 00:02:31.080
 educational institution they will be somehow 

00:02:28.049 --> 00:02:38.069
 the way perry their energy forms 

00:02:31.080 --> 00:02:43.260
 will become stable and all people 

00:02:38.069 --> 00:02:45.480
 who in their own interests do not 

00:02:43.260 --> 00:02:49.579
 refers Do not support this 

00:02:45.480 --> 00:02:52.880
 organization they will find themselves 

00:02:49.579 --> 00:02:57.690
 other use another place 

00:02:52.880 --> 00:03:01.379
 learning another job at now 

00:02:57.690 --> 00:03:04.709
 starting from this zero point will 

00:03:01.379 --> 00:03:08.160
 it's hard enough to stay where 

00:03:04.709 --> 00:03:11.040
 you are not a member where you are not 

00:03:08.160 --> 00:03:14.819
 support the energy of this less 

00:03:11.040 --> 00:03:20.420
 gregor where you are not part of this 

00:03:14.819 --> 00:03:24.359
 organizations do not think it is 

00:03:20.420 --> 00:03:27.959
 something colored by a person 

00:03:24.359 --> 00:03:31.349
 transformation is negative here 

00:03:27.959 --> 00:03:34.019
 total space and very much 

00:03:31.349 --> 00:03:36.780
 people will feel this transformation 

00:03:34.019 --> 00:03:41.450
 which big organizations are involved 

00:03:36.780 --> 00:03:45.359
 large groups they will begin to understand what 

00:03:41.450 --> 00:03:48.299
 they either really fit either them 

00:03:45.359 --> 00:03:51.930
 need to get out of the influence of this 

00:03:48.299 --> 00:03:56.639
 less gregor otherwise just further 

00:03:51.930 --> 00:04:00.269
 it is impossible to exist and yours here 

00:03:56.639 --> 00:04:04.049
 such a 0 . help you help you 

00:04:00.269 --> 00:04:07.620
 understand what is finally 

00:04:04.049 --> 00:04:11.140
 need to do 0. 

00:04:07.620 --> 00:04:15.190
 exactly necessary to 

00:04:11.140 --> 00:04:18.470
 start living from scratch and 

00:04:15.190 --> 00:04:21.430
 build your space in 

00:04:18.470 --> 00:04:24.650
 according to the desire of your soul 

00:04:21.430 --> 00:04:28.810
 maybe a bit of a challenge and we 

00:04:24.650 --> 00:04:32.210
 advise to listen to this forecast 

00:04:28.810 --> 00:04:35.750
 several times before that information 

00:04:32.210 --> 00:04:38.530
 started turning you in understanding 

00:04:35.750 --> 00:04:43.370
 more thoroughly and possibly 

00:04:38.530 --> 00:04:48.860
 supplemented by some kind of your thoughts for 

00:04:43.370 --> 00:04:51.950
 order for you to paint a picture of the week you 

00:04:48.860 --> 00:04:54.830
 draw or draw a plan from you 

00:04:51.950 --> 00:04:57.860
 consciousness what can be done next if 

00:04:54.830 --> 00:04:59.650
 the prerequisites of what was already appeared 

00:04:57.860 --> 00:05:03.230
 said keep going 

00:04:59.650 --> 00:05:06.430
 according to the recommendations we 

00:05:03.230 --> 00:05:11.230
 we hope that many will succeed and 

00:05:06.430 --> 00:05:11.230
 I wish you success on a date
