00:00:33.020 --> 00:00:33.030 
an unboxing I mean what you see is what

00:00:33.030 --> 00:00:35.900 
an unboxing I mean what you see is what
you're<00:00:33.420> gonna<00:00:33.540> get<00:00:33.899> anyway<00:00:34.350> so<00:00:34.410> on<00:00:34.829> I'll<00:00:35.280> skip

00:00:35.900 --> 00:00:35.910 
you're gonna get anyway so on I'll skip

around<00:00:36.120> to<00:00:36.329> when<00:00:36.450> I'm<00:00:36.570> unboxing<00:00:37.320> this<00:00:37.440> stuff

00:00:37.670 --> 00:00:37.680 
around to when I'm unboxing this stuff

00:00:37.680 --> 00:00:40.160 
around to when I'm unboxing this stuff
but<00:00:38.370> it's<00:00:38.850> pretty<00:00:39.059> cool<00:00:39.149> I<00:00:39.210> guess<00:00:39.300> the<00:00:39.690> the<00:00:40.020> day

00:00:40.160 --> 00:00:40.170 
but it's pretty cool I guess the the day

00:00:40.170 --> 00:00:42.350 
but it's pretty cool I guess the the day
once<00:00:40.440> come<00:00:40.710> in<00:00:40.829> this<00:00:40.950> like<00:00:41.100> black<00:00:41.610> box<00:00:41.969> again

00:00:42.350 --> 00:00:42.360

once come in this like black box again
and<00:00:42.510> I<00:00:42.809> guess<00:00:42.989> the<00:00:43.170> regular<00:00:43.559> ones<00:00:43.739> coming<00:00:44.070> what

00:00:44.540 --> 00:00:44.550 
and I guess the regular ones coming what

00:00:44.550 --> 00:00:46.610 
and I guess the regular ones coming what
the<00:00:44.760> green<00:00:45.000> box<00:00:45.270> you<00:00:45.840> know<00:00:45.960> the<00:00:46.110> normal<00:00:46.350> ones

00:01:40.340 --> 00:01:40.350 
controller is huge I mean initially they

00:01:40.350 --> 00:01:41.359 
controller is huge I mean initially they
weren't<00:01:40.500> even<00:01:40.560> going<00:01:40.740> to<00:01:40.799> include<00:01:41.130> it<00:01:41.280> in

00:01:41.359 --> 00:01:41.369 
weren't even going to include it in

00:01:41.369 --> 00:01:44.120 
weren't even going to include it in
there<00:01:41.549> but<00:01:41.840> it's<00:01:42.840> whatever<00:01:43.140> it<00:01:43.229> it's<00:01:43.799> it's

00:01:51.299 --> 00:01:53.210 
my uh one of what one of the best things
I<00:01:51.390> can<00:01:51.540> say<00:01:51.659> about<00:01:51.750> the<00:01:51.960> xbox<00:01:52.170> one<00:01:52.500> is<00:01:52.680> the

00:01:53.210 --> 00:01:53.220 
I can say about the xbox one is the

00:01:53.220 --> 00:01:55.880 
I can say about the xbox one is the
controller<00:01:53.670> the<00:01:53.909> controller<00:01:53.939> is<00:01:54.890> fantastic

00:01:55.880 --> 00:01:55.890 
controller the controller is fantastic

00:01:55.890 --> 00:01:57.469 
controller the controller is fantastic
as<00:01:56.070> of<00:01:56.310> course<00:01:56.520> I<00:01:56.579> got<00:01:56.700> the<00:01:56.790> day<00:01:56.939> one<00:01:57.119> edition

00:01:57.469 --> 00:01:57.479 
as of course I got the day one edition

00:01:57.479 --> 00:02:00.319 
as of course I got the day one edition
so<00:01:57.600> the<00:01:57.689> controller<00:01:57.990> says<00:01:58.229> day<00:01:58.439> 1<00:01:58.649> 2013<00:01:59.340> but

00:02:00.319 --> 00:02:00.329 
so the controller says day 1 2013 but

00:02:00.329 --> 00:02:03.109 
so the controller says day 1 2013 but
but<00:02:00.659> it<00:02:00.810> really<00:02:01.110> is<00:02:01.320> an<00:02:01.439> improvement<00:02:01.740> it<00:02:02.700> lays

00:02:03.109 --> 00:02:03.119 
but it really is an improvement it lays

00:02:03.119 --> 00:02:05.090 
but it really is an improvement it lays
in<00:02:03.270> your<00:02:03.329> hands<00:02:03.600> so<00:02:03.719> comfortably<00:02:04.380> they

00:02:05.090 --> 00:02:05.100 
in your hands so comfortably they

00:02:05.100 --> 00:02:07.550 
in your hands so comfortably they
modified<00:02:05.759> you<00:02:06.000> know<00:02:06.119> the<00:02:06.270> triggers<00:02:06.689> a<00:02:06.719> little

00:02:07.550 --> 00:02:07.560 
modified you know the triggers a little

00:02:07.560 --> 00:02:10.139 
modified you know the triggers a little
bit<00:02:07.740> it<00:02:08.099> feels<00:02:08.129> a<00:02:08.520> little<00:02:08.610> bit<00:02:08.910> better<00:02:09.119> it<00:02:09.899> does

00:02:10.139 --> 00:02:10.149 
bit it feels a little bit better it does

00:02:10.149 --> 00:02:12.899 
bit it feels a little bit better it does
as<00:02:10.659> far<00:02:11.200> to<00:02:11.230> go<00:02:11.650> with<00:02:12.220> the<00:02:12.400> triggers<00:02:12.760> the

00:02:12.899 --> 00:02:12.909 
as far to go with the triggers the

00:02:12.909 --> 00:02:14.850 
as far to go with the triggers the
d-pads<00:02:13.329> very<00:02:13.599> simple<00:02:14.079> the<00:02:14.230> thumb<00:02:14.439> sticks<00:02:14.709> are

00:02:14.850 --> 00:02:14.860 
d-pads very simple the thumb sticks are

00:02:14.860 --> 00:02:16.770 
d-pads very simple the thumb sticks are
still<00:02:15.069> concave<00:02:15.549> they<00:02:16.239> have<00:02:16.390> a<00:02:16.420> little<00:02:16.629> bit

00:02:16.770 --> 00:02:16.780 
still concave they have a little bit

00:02:16.780 --> 00:02:19.530 
still concave they have a little bit
more<00:02:16.930> radius<00:02:17.349> room<00:02:17.709> to<00:02:17.920> rotate<00:02:18.610> around<00:02:18.730> and<00:02:19.180> of

00:02:19.530 --> 00:02:19.540 
more radius room to rotate around and of

00:02:19.540 --> 00:02:21.569 
more radius room to rotate around and of
course<00:02:19.750> the<00:02:19.900> battery<00:02:20.319> in<00:02:20.500> the<00:02:20.590> back<00:02:20.769> is<00:02:21.069> no

00:02:21.569 --> 00:02:21.579 
course the battery in the back is no

00:02:21.579 --> 00:02:23.640 
course the battery in the back is no
longer<00:02:21.790> sticking<00:02:22.239> out<00:02:22.329> double<00:02:22.689> D<00:02:22.840> or<00:02:23.079> yeah

00:02:23.640 --> 00:02:23.650 
longer sticking out double D or yeah

00:02:23.650 --> 00:02:26.280 
longer sticking out double D or yeah
double<00:02:24.010> a<00:02:24.099> double<00:02:24.670> a<00:02:25.150> batteries<00:02:25.599> but<00:02:25.840> uh<00:02:25.870> it's

00:02:26.280 --> 00:02:26.290 
double a double a batteries but uh it's

00:02:26.290 --> 00:02:27.750 
double a double a batteries but uh it's
pretty<00:02:26.560> nice<00:02:26.680> over<00:02:27.310> here<00:02:27.489> you<00:02:27.609> have<00:02:27.640> your

00:02:27.750 --> 00:02:27.760 
pretty nice over here you have your

00:02:27.760 --> 00:02:30.089 
pretty nice over here you have your
standard<00:02:28.420> this<00:02:28.780> is<00:02:28.959> the<00:02:29.079> hdmi<00:02:29.620> cable<00:02:29.980> that

00:02:30.089 --> 00:02:30.099 
standard this is the hdmi cable that

00:02:30.099 --> 00:02:31.920 
standard this is the hdmi cable that
comes<00:02:30.250> with<00:02:30.549> it<00:02:30.579> then<00:02:31.150> you<00:02:31.269> got<00:02:31.450> you<00:02:31.629> know<00:02:31.689> your

00:02:31.920 --> 00:02:31.930 
comes with it then you got you know your

00:02:31.930 --> 00:02:34.199 
comes with it then you got you know your
power<00:02:32.140> cord<00:02:32.530> and<00:02:32.950> then<00:02:33.280> the<00:02:33.400> big<00:02:33.609> box<00:02:33.819> which<00:02:34.120> i

00:02:34.199 --> 00:02:34.209 
power cord and then the big box which i

00:02:34.209 --> 00:02:35.610 
power cord and then the big box which i
believe<00:02:34.269> the<00:02:34.569> ps4<00:02:34.840> doesn't<00:02:35.260> even<00:02:35.349> have<00:02:35.500> this

00:02:35.610 --> 00:02:35.620 
believe the ps4 doesn't even have this

00:02:35.620 --> 00:02:36.990 
believe the ps4 doesn't even have this
box<00:02:35.859> it's<00:02:36.069> kind<00:02:36.250> of<00:02:36.280> like<00:02:36.370> built<00:02:36.640> into<00:02:36.879> it<00:02:36.970> so

00:02:36.990 --> 00:02:37.000 
box it's kind of like built into it so

00:02:37.000 --> 00:02:39.720 
box it's kind of like built into it so
this<00:02:37.359> is<00:02:37.510> a<00:02:37.540> big<00:02:37.569> battery<00:02:38.079> box<00:02:38.400> but<00:02:39.400> yeah<00:02:39.609> it

00:02:39.720 --> 00:02:39.730 
this is a big battery box but yeah it

00:02:39.730 --> 00:02:41.399 
this is a big battery box but yeah it
was<00:02:39.790> actually<00:02:40.090> pretty<00:02:40.120> big<00:02:40.720> by<00:02:41.049> the<00:02:41.140> way<00:02:41.260> this

00:02:41.399 --> 00:02:41.409 
was actually pretty big by the way this

00:02:41.409 --> 00:02:43.680 
was actually pretty big by the way this
whole<00:02:41.620> thing<00:02:42.010> was<00:02:42.159> massively<00:02:42.849> heavy<00:02:43.120> i<00:02:43.269> forgot

00:02:43.680 --> 00:02:43.690
