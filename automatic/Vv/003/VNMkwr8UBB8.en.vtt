research scientist really bad diseases

00:00:30.960 --> 00:00:32.680 
research scientist really bad diseases
that<00:00:31.260> they<00:00:31.410> wouldn't<00:00:31.679> otherwise<00:00:31.769> be<00:00:32.099> able<00:00:32.309> to

00:00:37.010 --> 00:00:37.020 
show you the truth of that stem cells

00:00:37.020 --> 00:00:39.110 
show you the truth of that stem cells
did<00:00:37.860> you<00:00:38.010> know<00:00:38.160> that<00:00:38.370> stem<00:00:38.579> cells<00:00:38.820> come<00:00:39.090> from

00:00:39.110 --> 00:00:39.120 
did you know that stem cells come from

00:00:39.120 --> 00:00:41.209 
did you know that stem cells come from
baileys<00:00:39.629> and<00:00:39.809> how<00:00:40.590> do<00:00:40.649> you<00:00:40.770> think<00:00:40.980> they<00:00:41.070> get

baileys and how do you think they get

00:00:41.219 --> 00:01:12.490 
baileys and how do you think they get
stem<00:00:41.550> cells

00:01:12.490 --> 00:01:12.500 

00:01:12.500 --> 00:01:18.860 

that's<00:01:13.500> right<00:01:13.830> they<00:01:14.160> steal<00:01:14.400> babies<00:01:17.390> and<00:01:18.390> don't

be fooled by the name do you know what

00:01:20.850 --> 00:01:23.870 
be fooled by the name do you know what
stem<00:01:21.060> cell<00:01:21.270> research<00:01:21.570> is<00:01:21.979> cloning<00:01:22.979> that's

00:01:23.870 --> 00:01:23.880 
stem cell research is cloning that's

00:01:23.880 --> 00:01:25.670 
stem cell research is cloning that's
right<00:01:24.180> Johnny<00:01:24.479> those<00:01:24.930> scientists<00:01:25.380> are<00:01:25.560> going

00:01:25.670 --> 00:01:25.680 
right Johnny those scientists are going

00:01:25.680 --> 00:01:27.109 
right Johnny those scientists are going
to<00:01:25.740> take<00:01:25.920> away<00:01:26.100> everything<00:01:26.430> that<00:01:26.759> makes<00:01:26.910> you

00:01:27.109 --> 00:01:27.119 
to take away everything that makes you

00:01:27.119 --> 00:01:29.930 
to take away everything that makes you
unique<00:01:27.479> and<00:01:28.040> with<00:01:29.040> this<00:01:29.160> ability<00:01:29.460> to<00:01:29.640> clone

00:01:29.930 --> 00:01:29.940 
unique and with this ability to clone

00:01:29.940 --> 00:01:31.760 
unique and with this ability to clone
babies<00:01:30.360> sexual<00:01:30.930> intercourse<00:01:31.080> will<00:01:31.530> become

00:01:31.760 --> 00:01:31.770 
babies sexual intercourse will become

00:01:31.770 --> 00:01:51.270 
babies sexual intercourse will become
obsolete

if you think that's bad just wait till
they<00:01:57.200> clone<00:01:57.409> those<00:01:57.590> liberal<00:01:58.009> freeloaders<00:01:58.580> and

00:01:58.719 --> 00:01:58.729 
they clone those liberal freeloaders and

00:01:58.729 --> 00:02:00.310 
they clone those liberal freeloaders and
our<00:01:58.820> countries<00:01:59.180> overrun<00:01:59.690> with<00:01:59.720> their<00:02:00.020> filthy

they've<00:02:29.959> cloned<00:02:30.290> that's<00:02:31.220> right<00:02:31.519> dinosaurs

00:02:32.440 --> 00:02:32.450 
they've cloned that's right dinosaurs

00:02:32.450 --> 00:02:34.090 
they've cloned that's right dinosaurs
you<00:02:33.200> would<00:02:33.320> think<00:02:33.350> we'd<00:02:33.650> have<00:02:33.680> learned<00:02:33.920> from

00:02:34.090 --> 00:02:34.100
