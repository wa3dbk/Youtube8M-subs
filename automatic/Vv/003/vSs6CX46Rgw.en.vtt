00:05:30.920 --> 00:05:30.930 
let's go quick observation here just

00:05:30.930 --> 00:05:32.990 
let's go quick observation here just
from<00:05:30.990> the<00:05:31.110> backseat<00:05:31.530> look<00:05:32.039> at<00:05:32.160> this<00:05:32.280> screen<00:05:32.669> it

00:05:32.990 --> 00:05:33.000 
from the backseat look at this screen it

00:05:33.000 --> 00:05:36.050 
from the backseat look at this screen it
is<00:05:33.180> so<00:05:33.599> big<00:05:34.020> in<00:05:34.289> great<00:05:34.949> detail<00:05:35.520> on<00:05:35.729> the

00:05:36.050 --> 00:05:36.060 
is so big in great detail on the

00:05:36.060 --> 00:05:39.740 
is so big in great detail on the
infotainment<00:05:36.419> navigation<00:05:37.410> screen<00:05:38.750> here's

00:05:39.740 --> 00:05:39.750 
infotainment navigation screen here's

00:05:39.750 --> 00:05:41.629 
infotainment navigation screen here's
one<00:05:39.930> thing<00:05:40.050> you'll<00:05:40.229> see<00:05:40.410> on<00:05:40.560> a<00:05:40.590> lot<00:05:40.770> of<00:05:40.830> BMWs<00:05:41.520> at

00:05:41.629 --> 00:05:41.639 
one thing you'll see on a lot of BMWs at

00:05:41.639 --> 00:05:44.810 
one thing you'll see on a lot of BMWs at
least<00:05:41.789> I<00:05:41.940> have<00:05:42.180> is<00:05:42.449> this<00:05:42.900> air<00:05:43.680> slit<00:05:44.280> right<00:05:44.460> here

00:05:44.810 --> 00:05:44.820 
least I have is this air slit right here

00:05:44.820 --> 00:05:46.760 
least I have is this air slit right here
along<00:05:45.360> the<00:05:45.570> backside<00:05:46.110> of<00:05:46.169> the<00:05:46.530> wheel

00:05:46.760 --> 00:05:46.770 
along the backside of the wheel

00:05:46.770 --> 00:05:48.770 
along the backside of the wheel
apparently<00:05:47.280> this<00:05:47.370> helps<00:05:47.760> keep<00:05:47.970> the<00:05:48.150> the<00:05:48.570> wheel

00:05:48.770 --> 00:05:48.780 
apparently this helps keep the the wheel

00:05:48.780 --> 00:05:50.779 
apparently this helps keep the the wheel
well<00:05:49.020> cooler<00:05:49.590> and<00:05:49.830> supposed<00:05:50.520> to<00:05:50.550> be<00:05:50.639> better

00:05:50.779 --> 00:05:50.789 
well cooler and supposed to be better

00:05:50.789 --> 00:05:52.460 
well cooler and supposed to be better
for<00:05:50.910> aerodynamics<00:05:51.510> which<00:05:51.659> in<00:05:51.780> turn<00:05:52.020> should<00:05:52.320> be

00:05:52.460 --> 00:05:52.470 
for aerodynamics which in turn should be

00:05:52.470 --> 00:05:53.990 
for aerodynamics which in turn should be
better<00:05:52.620> for<00:05:52.830> fuel<00:05:53.010> economy<00:05:53.190> at<00:05:53.699> least<00:05:53.789> that's

00:05:53.990 --> 00:05:54.000 
better for fuel economy at least that's

00:05:54.000 --> 00:05:57.020 
better for fuel economy at least that's
what<00:05:54.030> I've<00:05:54.180> experienced<00:05:54.720> in<00:05:54.840> other<00:05:55.380> BMWs<00:05:56.039> we

00:06:20.640 --> 00:06:20.650 
cargo room area yeah look at this

00:06:20.650 --> 00:06:26.280 
cargo room area yeah look at this
see<00:06:22.680> folds<00:06:23.680> out<00:06:23.800> for<00:06:24.190> protection<00:06:25.180> so<00:06:26.050> to<00:06:26.110> keep

how do I fold those down looks like the
best<00:06:43.690> way<00:06:43.840> to<00:06:43.870> fold<00:06:44.139> these<00:06:44.290> down<00:06:44.350> is<00:06:44.680> from

00:06:44.879 --> 00:06:44.889 
best way to fold these down is from

00:06:44.889 --> 00:06:48.600 
best way to fold these down is from
inside<00:06:45.370> the<00:06:45.490> vehicle<00:06:45.610> oh<00:06:46.000> I<00:06:46.510> guess<00:06:47.260> it<00:06:47.380> is<00:06:47.500> a<00:06:47.680> it

00:06:48.600 --> 00:06:48.610 
inside the vehicle oh I guess it is a it

00:06:48.610 --> 00:06:53.550 
inside the vehicle oh I guess it is a it
is<00:06:48.820> a<00:06:50.430> 40/20/40<00:06:51.430> same<00:06:52.240> thing<00:06:52.419> over<00:06:52.600> there<00:06:52.780> just

00:06:53.550 --> 00:06:53.560 
is a 40/20/40 same thing over there just

00:06:53.560 --> 00:06:56.040 
is a 40/20/40 same thing over there just
press<00:06:53.770> the<00:06:53.919> button<00:06:54.039> on<00:06:54.280> top<00:06:54.580> and<00:06:54.850> it'll<00:06:55.810> open
