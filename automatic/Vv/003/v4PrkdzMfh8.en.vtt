clean<00:02:44.150> the<00:02:44.510> skin<00:02:45.610> and<00:02:46.610> then<00:02:46.790> we<00:02:47.180> want<00:02:47.420> to<00:02:47.510> add

00:02:47.890 --> 00:02:47.900 
clean the skin and then we want to add

00:02:47.900 --> 00:02:50.740 
clean the skin and then we want to add
the<00:02:48.530> lemon<00:02:49.040> juice<00:02:49.220> that<00:02:49.610> you<00:02:49.750> squeezed

00:02:50.740 --> 00:02:50.750 
the lemon juice that you squeezed

00:02:50.750 --> 00:02:53.650 
the lemon juice that you squeezed
earlier<00:02:51.200> the<00:02:51.680> lemon<00:02:52.010> will<00:02:52.280> help<00:02:52.489> to<00:02:52.790> clean

00:02:53.650 --> 00:02:53.660 
earlier the lemon will help to clean

00:02:53.660 --> 00:02:56.140 
earlier the lemon will help to clean
greasy<00:02:54.470> skin<00:02:54.769> so<00:02:55.459> if<00:02:55.549> you<00:02:55.640> have<00:02:55.790> really<00:02:56.030> dry

00:02:56.140 --> 00:02:56.150 
greasy skin so if you have really dry

00:02:56.150 --> 00:02:58.810 
greasy skin so if you have really dry
skin<00:02:56.360> and<00:02:57.110> they<00:02:57.620> add<00:02:57.860> about<00:02:58.160> half<00:02:58.489> a

00:02:58.810 --> 00:02:58.820 
skin and they add about half a

00:02:58.820 --> 00:03:00.940 
skin and they add about half a
tablespoon<00:02:59.239> of<00:02:59.690> lemon<00:02:59.900> juice<00:03:00.260> but<00:03:00.680> if<00:03:00.799> your

00:03:00.940 --> 00:03:00.950 
tablespoon of lemon juice but if your

00:03:00.950 --> 00:03:03.640 
tablespoon of lemon juice but if your
skin<00:03:01.190> is<00:03:01.280> quite<00:03:01.400> greasy<00:03:01.760> you<00:03:01.940> can<00:03:02.239> add<00:03:02.450> up<00:03:03.350> to

00:03:03.640 --> 00:03:03.650 
skin is quite greasy you can add up to

00:03:03.650 --> 00:03:06.880 
skin is quite greasy you can add up to
one<00:03:03.950> tablespoon<00:03:04.640> of<00:03:05.480> lemon<00:03:05.690> juice<00:03:06.019> my<00:03:06.829> is

00:03:06.880 --> 00:03:06.890 
one tablespoon of lemon juice my is

00:03:06.890 --> 00:03:08.440 
one tablespoon of lemon juice my is
actually<00:03:07.310> a<00:03:07.340> little<00:03:07.489> bit<00:03:07.700> dry<00:03:07.940> so<00:03:07.970> I'm<00:03:08.299> only

00:03:08.440 --> 00:03:08.450 
actually a little bit dry so I'm only

00:03:08.450 --> 00:03:12.160 
actually a little bit dry so I'm only
going<00:03:08.720> to<00:03:08.780> add<00:03:08.959> 1/2<00:03:09.260> a<00:03:09.500> tablespoon<00:03:11.170> then

00:03:12.160 --> 00:03:12.170 
going to add 1/2 a tablespoon then

00:03:12.170 --> 00:03:13.810 
going to add 1/2 a tablespoon then
you'll<00:03:12.290> just<00:03:12.440> need<00:03:12.590> to<00:03:12.799> mix<00:03:13.040> it<00:03:13.190> all<00:03:13.310> up<00:03:13.519> into

00:03:13.810 --> 00:03:13.820 
you'll just need to mix it all up into

00:03:13.820 --> 00:03:21.500 
you'll just need to mix it all up into
lift<00:03:14.470> until<00:03:15.470> it's<00:03:15.860> all<00:03:16.010> combined

00:03:21.500 --> 00:03:21.510 

00:03:21.510 --> 00:03:23.420 

the<00:03:22.020> carrots<00:03:22.379> are<00:03:22.560> still<00:03:22.770> going<00:03:22.950> to<00:03:23.040> be<00:03:23.129> really

00:03:23.420 --> 00:03:23.430 
the carrots are still going to be really

00:03:23.430 --> 00:03:25.550 
the carrots are still going to be really
hot<00:03:23.730> from<00:03:24.120> and<00:03:24.510> you've<00:03:24.660> steamed<00:03:24.959> them<00:03:25.170> earlier

00:03:25.550 --> 00:03:25.560 
hot from and you've steamed them earlier

00:03:25.560 --> 00:03:27.860 
hot from and you've steamed them earlier
so<00:03:26.250> what<00:03:26.700> we're<00:03:26.819> going<00:03:26.940> to<00:03:27.000> do<00:03:27.180> is<00:03:27.330> pop<00:03:27.599> this

00:03:27.860 --> 00:03:27.870 
so what we're going to do is pop this

00:03:27.870 --> 00:03:30.320 
so what we're going to do is pop this
mixture<00:03:28.290> into<00:03:28.709> there<00:03:29.099> into<00:03:29.489> the<00:03:30.030> fridge<00:03:30.300> for

00:03:30.320 --> 00:03:30.330 
mixture into there into the fridge for

00:03:30.330 --> 00:03:34.670 
mixture into there into the fridge for
about<00:03:31.610> 10<00:03:32.610> to<00:03:32.910> 20<00:03:33.269> minutes<00:03:33.300> and<00:03:33.840> just<00:03:33.900> until

00:03:34.670 --> 00:03:34.680 
about 10 to 20 minutes and just until

00:03:34.680 --> 00:03:48.840 
about 10 to 20 minutes and just until
they're<00:03:34.890> nice<00:03:35.069> and<00:03:35.099> cool

00:03:48.840 --> 00:03:48.850 

00:03:48.850 --> 00:03:51.370 

once<00:03:49.850> your<00:03:50.240> carrots<00:03:50.810> are<00:03:50.990> cooled<00:03:51.230> down

00:03:51.370 --> 00:03:51.380 
once your carrots are cooled down

00:03:51.380 --> 00:03:53.470 
once your carrots are cooled down
completely<00:03:51.440> you<00:03:52.400> can<00:03:52.610> remove<00:03:52.940> them<00:03:53.150> from<00:03:53.300> the

00:03:53.470 --> 00:03:53.480 
completely you can remove them from the

00:03:53.480 --> 00:03:55.630 
completely you can remove them from the
fridge<00:03:53.780> they<00:03:54.319> will<00:03:54.500> look<00:03:54.620> quite<00:03:54.920> chunky<00:03:55.220> and

00:03:55.630 --> 00:03:55.640 
fridge they will look quite chunky and

00:03:55.640 --> 00:03:57.760 
fridge they will look quite chunky and
then<00:03:56.360> if<00:03:56.540> you<00:03:56.690> leave<00:03:56.900> it<00:03:57.020> like<00:03:57.050> this<00:03:57.200> it's

00:03:57.760 --> 00:03:57.770 
then if you leave it like this it's

00:03:57.770 --> 00:03:59.890 
then if you leave it like this it's
going<00:03:57.950> to<00:03:58.010> be<00:03:58.160> really<00:03:58.550> hard<00:03:58.730> to<00:03:58.880> apply<00:03:59.420> it<00:03:59.690> onto

00:03:59.890 --> 00:03:59.900 
going to be really hard to apply it onto

00:03:59.900 --> 00:04:02.530 
going to be really hard to apply it onto
your<00:04:00.140> face<00:04:00.200> like<00:04:00.709> the<00:04:00.980> mix<00:04:01.790> the<00:04:02.090> carrot<00:04:02.420> will

00:04:02.530 --> 00:04:02.540 
your face like the mix the carrot will

00:04:02.540 --> 00:04:04.180 
your face like the mix the carrot will
just<00:04:02.750> fall<00:04:03.050> off<00:04:03.260> your<00:04:03.440> face<00:04:03.620> all<00:04:03.830> the<00:04:03.920> time

00:04:04.180 --> 00:04:04.190 
just fall off your face all the time

00:04:04.190 --> 00:04:07.420 
just fall off your face all the time
so<00:04:04.880> what<00:04:05.569> we<00:04:05.690> need<00:04:05.870> to<00:04:05.989> do<00:04:06.200> is<00:04:06.530> is<00:04:06.860> one<00:04:07.160> of<00:04:07.280> these

00:04:07.420 --> 00:04:07.430 
so what we need to do is is one of these

00:04:07.430 --> 00:04:10.240 
so what we need to do is is one of these
contraptions<00:04:08.030> it's<00:04:08.840> called<00:04:09.170> a<00:04:09.290> stick<00:04:09.620> mixer

00:04:10.240 --> 00:04:10.250 
contraptions it's called a stick mixer

00:04:10.250 --> 00:04:12.580 
contraptions it's called a stick mixer
and<00:04:10.459> it<00:04:10.850> basically<00:04:11.000> just<00:04:11.480> just<00:04:12.290> kind<00:04:12.500> of

00:04:12.580 --> 00:04:12.590 
and it basically just just kind of

00:04:12.590 --> 00:04:14.979 
and it basically just just kind of
combines<00:04:13.010> all<00:04:13.280> the<00:04:13.400> carrots<00:04:13.730> together<00:04:13.880> if<00:04:14.810> you

00:04:14.979 --> 00:04:14.989 
combines all the carrots together if you

00:04:14.989 --> 00:04:16.300 
combines all the carrots together if you
don't<00:04:15.170> have<00:04:15.320> one<00:04:15.470> of<00:04:15.590> these<00:04:15.680> you<00:04:15.739> could<00:04:16.040> just

00:04:16.300 --> 00:04:16.310 
don't have one of these you could just

00:04:16.310 --> 00:04:20.050 
don't have one of these you could just
use<00:04:16.669> like<00:04:16.970> a<00:04:17.030> food<00:04:17.510> processor<00:04:18.230> or<00:04:18.500> a<00:04:19.060> electric

00:04:20.050 --> 00:04:20.060 
use like a food processor or a electric

00:04:20.060 --> 00:04:21.789 
use like a food processor or a electric
mixer<00:04:20.299> just<00:04:21.019> something<00:04:21.380> that's<00:04:21.500> going<00:04:21.709> to

00:04:21.789 --> 00:04:21.799 
mixer just something that's going to

00:04:21.799 --> 00:04:24.490 
mixer just something that's going to
combine<00:04:22.070> all<00:04:22.340> the<00:04:22.790> carrots<00:04:23.180> together<00:04:23.600> to<00:04:23.960> make

00:04:24.490 --> 00:04:24.500 
combine all the carrots together to make

00:04:24.500 --> 00:04:35.230 
combine all the carrots together to make
a<00:04:24.740> paste<00:04:25.430> like<00:04:25.790> consistency<00:04:33.760> so<00:04:34.760> that's<00:04:34.970> the

00:04:35.230 --> 00:04:35.240 
a paste like consistency so that's the

00:04:35.240 --> 00:04:37.719 
a paste like consistency so that's the
kind<00:04:35.510> of<00:04:35.600> consistency<00:04:36.290> you're<00:04:36.770> going<00:04:36.979> to<00:04:37.100> want

00:04:37.719 --> 00:04:37.729 
kind of consistency you're going to want

00:04:37.729 --> 00:04:39.610 
kind of consistency you're going to want
to<00:04:37.880> try<00:04:38.090> and<00:04:38.120> get<00:04:38.419> once<00:04:38.780> your<00:04:38.960> carrot<00:04:39.290> mixture

00:04:39.610 --> 00:04:39.620 
to try and get once your carrot mixture

00:04:39.620 --> 00:04:41.860 
to try and get once your carrot mixture
has<00:04:39.919> cooled<00:04:40.220> down<00:04:40.340> completely<00:04:40.850> you<00:04:41.450> can<00:04:41.600> apply

00:04:41.860 --> 00:04:41.870 
has cooled down completely you can apply

00:04:41.870 --> 00:04:44.409 
has cooled down completely you can apply
it<00:04:41.930> to<00:04:42.020> your<00:04:42.200> face<00:04:42.530> and<00:04:42.860> a<00:04:43.430> good<00:04:43.729> tip<00:04:43.940> is<00:04:44.210> to

00:04:44.409 --> 00:04:44.419 
it to your face and a good tip is to

00:04:44.419 --> 00:04:46.480 
it to your face and a good tip is to
just<00:04:44.450> clip<00:04:44.900> all<00:04:45.110> of<00:04:45.260> your<00:04:45.410> hair<00:04:45.620> out<00:04:45.919> of<00:04:46.130> your

00:04:46.480 --> 00:04:46.490 
just clip all of your hair out of your

00:04:46.490 --> 00:04:48.580 
just clip all of your hair out of your
face<00:04:46.640> just<00:04:47.090> so<00:04:47.300> that<00:04:47.510> the<00:04:47.780> carrot<00:04:48.110> doesn't<00:04:48.410> get

00:04:48.580 --> 00:04:48.590 
face just so that the carrot doesn't get

00:04:48.590 --> 00:04:50.680 
face just so that the carrot doesn't get
smushed<00:04:48.919> into<00:04:49.160> your<00:04:49.460> hair<00:04:49.610> I'm<00:04:50.120> just<00:04:50.180> going<00:04:50.630> to

00:04:50.680 --> 00:04:50.690 
smushed into your hair I'm just going to

00:04:50.690 --> 00:04:56.560 
smushed into your hair I'm just going to
use<00:04:50.840> one<00:04:51.050> of<00:04:51.169> the<00:04:51.320> headband<00:04:51.919> things<00:04:55.479> the<00:04:56.479> only

00:04:56.560 --> 00:04:56.570 
use one of the headband things the only

00:04:56.570 --> 00:04:58.150 
use one of the headband things the only
thing<00:04:56.870> I<00:04:56.960> don't<00:04:57.229> really<00:04:57.440> like<00:04:57.680> about<00:04:57.830> this

00:04:58.150 --> 00:04:58.160 
thing I don't really like about this

00:04:58.160 --> 00:05:00.790 
thing I don't really like about this
mixture<00:04:58.610> is<00:04:59.000> it<00:04:59.900> doesn't<00:05:00.350> really<00:05:00.470> stay<00:05:00.770> on

00:05:00.790 --> 00:05:00.800 
mixture is it doesn't really stay on

00:05:00.800 --> 00:05:03.190 
mixture is it doesn't really stay on
your<00:05:01.010> face<00:05:01.190> if<00:05:01.460> you're<00:05:01.610> standing<00:05:02.000> up<00:05:02.200> like
