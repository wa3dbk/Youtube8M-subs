worlds but to figure out how we first

00:00:38.489 --> 00:00:40.490 
worlds but to figure out how we first
need<00:00:38.760> to<00:00:38.790> understand<00:00:39.360> a<00:00:39.390> bit<00:00:39.719> about<00:00:39.750> nutrition

00:00:40.490 --> 00:00:40.500 
need to understand a bit about nutrition

00:00:40.500 --> 00:00:43.250 
need to understand a bit about nutrition
the<00:00:41.010> two<00:00:41.219> enemies<00:00:41.579> of<00:00:41.730> nutrition<00:00:42.300> are<00:00:42.660> oxygen

00:00:43.250 --> 00:00:43.260 
the two enemies of nutrition are oxygen

00:00:43.260 --> 00:00:45.950 
the two enemies of nutrition are oxygen
and<00:00:43.500> heat<00:00:43.770> oxygen<00:00:44.550> starts<00:00:45.270> digests<00:00:45.899> the

and heat oxygen starts digests the

00:00:45.960 --> 00:00:47.750 
and heat oxygen starts digests the
nutrition<00:00:46.500> in<00:00:46.590> fruits<00:00:46.920> and<00:00:47.100> vegetables<00:00:47.640> the

00:00:47.750 --> 00:00:47.760 
nutrition in fruits and vegetables the

00:00:47.760 --> 00:00:50.479 
nutrition in fruits and vegetables the
moment<00:00:48.239> is<00:00:48.300> introduced<00:00:48.870> into<00:00:49.110> the<00:00:49.230> cells<00:00:49.559> the

00:00:50.479 --> 00:00:50.489 
moment is introduced into the cells the

00:00:50.489 --> 00:00:52.670 
moment is introduced into the cells the
more<00:00:50.700> oxygen<00:00:50.879> you<00:00:51.180> force<00:00:51.600> into<00:00:51.930> the<00:00:51.960> cells<00:00:52.320> the

00:00:52.670 --> 00:00:52.680 
more oxygen you force into the cells the

00:00:52.680 --> 00:00:54.439 
more oxygen you force into the cells the
more<00:00:52.890> you<00:00:53.010> destroy<00:00:53.430> the<00:00:53.579> nutrition<00:00:54.059> contained

00:00:54.439 --> 00:00:54.449 
more you destroy the nutrition contained

00:00:54.449 --> 00:00:56.840 
more you destroy the nutrition contained
within<00:00:54.660> this<00:00:55.530> is<00:00:55.710> why<00:00:55.890> blending<00:00:56.309> fruits<00:00:56.610> and

00:00:56.840 --> 00:00:56.850 
within this is why blending fruits and

00:00:56.850 --> 00:00:58.670 
within this is why blending fruits and
vegetables<00:00:57.329> is<00:00:57.510> not<00:00:57.750> good<00:00:58.020> at<00:00:58.140> maximizing

00:00:58.670 --> 00:00:58.680 
vegetables is not good at maximizing

00:00:58.680 --> 00:01:01.430 
vegetables is not good at maximizing
nutrients<00:00:59.280> from<00:00:59.399> food<00:00:59.570> when<00:01:00.570> you<00:01:00.690> blend<00:01:00.930> the

and with every spin in the blaze you

00:01:06.240 --> 00:01:08.510
