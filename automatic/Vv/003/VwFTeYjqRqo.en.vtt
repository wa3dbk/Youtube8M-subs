00:02:46.309 --> 00:02:46.319 
more volume a lower end and perhaps you

00:02:46.319 --> 00:02:47.870

00:02:49.370 --> 00:02:49.380 
so you can do a lot of foot work on them

00:02:49.380 --> 00:02:50.720 
so you can do a lot of foot work on them
but<00:02:49.500> you<00:02:49.560> still<00:02:49.829> want<00:02:50.040> it<00:02:50.130> to<00:02:50.220> sound<00:02:50.400> like<00:02:50.609> a

but you still want it to sound like a
low<00:02:51.000> pitch<00:02:51.269> you<00:02:51.870> can<00:02:51.989> get<00:02:52.079> a<00:02:52.139> little<00:02:52.380> more<00:02:52.500> of

00:02:52.670 --> 00:02:52.680 
low pitch you can get a little more of

00:02:52.680 --> 00:02:54.770 
low pitch you can get a little more of
that<00:02:52.709> more<00:02:53.609> of<00:02:53.670> that<00:02:53.850> from<00:02:54.030> the<00:02:54.120> 22<00:02:54.600> inch
