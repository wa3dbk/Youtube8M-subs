separate the eggs from each other so

00:02:00.570 --> 00:02:02.210 
separate the eggs from each other so
that<00:02:00.600> when<00:02:01.170> one<00:02:01.320> hatch<00:02:01.560> is<00:02:01.740> out<00:02:01.890> it<00:02:02.040> doesn't

00:02:02.210 --> 00:02:02.220 
that when one hatch is out it doesn't

00:02:02.220 --> 00:02:04.580 
that when one hatch is out it doesn't
bother<00:02:02.399> the<00:02:02.670> another<00:02:03.149> one<00:02:03.439> let's<00:02:04.439> go<00:02:04.530> ahead

00:02:04.580 --> 00:02:04.590 
bother the another one let's go ahead

00:02:04.590 --> 00:02:07.160 
bother the another one let's go ahead
and<00:02:04.740> check<00:02:04.890> a<00:02:04.950> couple<00:02:05.189> of<00:02:05.399> these<00:02:05.520> bins<00:02:06.170> doesn't

00:02:07.160 --> 00:02:07.170 
and check a couple of these bins doesn't

00:02:07.170 --> 00:02:10.370 
and check a couple of these bins doesn't
look<00:02:07.259> like<00:02:07.409> any<00:02:07.590> hatches<00:02:08.040> here<00:02:09.019> and<00:02:10.019> again<00:02:10.200> I'm

00:02:10.370 --> 00:02:10.380 
look like any hatches here and again I'm
