00:00:32.280 --> 00:00:32.290 
counter steering there is a little more

counter steering there is a little more
muscle<00:00:32.650> required<00:00:33.010> and<00:00:33.250> this<00:00:33.760> is<00:00:33.910> probably<00:00:34.180> due

muscle required and this is probably due

00:00:34.330 --> 00:00:35.670 
muscle required and this is probably due
to<00:00:34.360> the<00:00:34.449> fact<00:00:34.510> that<00:00:34.809> the<00:00:34.930> sport<00:00:35.229> bars<00:00:35.440> are<00:00:35.650> a

to the fact that the sport bars are a
bit<00:00:35.800> shorter<00:00:36.280> than<00:00:36.400> the<00:00:36.460> stock<00:00:36.790> and<00:00:37.030> provide

00:00:48.630 --> 00:00:48.640 
which does put a little more bend in

a taller than average rider they also
helped<00:00:57.190> me<00:00:57.369> with<00:00:57.400> the<00:00:57.760> wind<00:00:58.119> resistance<00:00:58.239> at

00:00:58.740 --> 00:00:58.750 
helped me with the wind resistance at

00:00:58.750 --> 00:01:01.320 
helped me with the wind resistance at
highway<00:00:58.930> speeds<00:00:59.350> by<00:00:59.860> bringing<00:01:00.190> me<00:01:00.400> down<00:01:00.909> and

00:01:01.320 --> 00:01:01.330 
highway speeds by bringing me down and

00:01:01.330 --> 00:01:03.210 
highway speeds by bringing me down and
forward<00:01:01.720> but<00:01:02.199> just<00:01:02.229> about<00:01:02.589> an<00:01:02.739> inch<00:01:02.920> or<00:01:03.070> two

forward but just about an inch or two
which<00:01:03.790> actually<00:01:04.089> helped<00:01:04.390> now<00:01:05.320> easy<00:01:05.619> to

00:01:05.850 --> 00:01:05.860 
which actually helped now easy to

00:01:43.829 --> 00:01:46.080 
noises and vibrations when riding and
even<00:01:44.829> while<00:01:44.979> the<00:01:45.130> actual<00:01:45.670> bike<00:01:45.789> is<00:01:45.939> just

00:01:46.080 --> 00:01:46.090 
even while the actual bike is just

00:01:46.090 --> 00:01:48.330 
even while the actual bike is just
idling<00:01:46.390> you'll<00:01:46.569> hear<00:01:46.749> that<00:01:46.960> because<00:01:47.619> I<00:01:47.890> did

00:01:48.330 --> 00:01:48.340 
idling you'll hear that because I did

00:01:48.340 --> 00:01:50.039 
idling you'll hear that because I did
put<00:01:48.549> off<00:01:48.670> flipping<00:01:49.060> the<00:01:49.149> bolt<00:01:49.359> initially<00:01:49.840> and

00:01:50.039 --> 00:01:50.049 
put off flipping the bolt initially and

00:01:50.049 --> 00:01:52.080 
put off flipping the bolt initially and
ended<00:01:50.770> up<00:01:50.859> with<00:01:51.039> that<00:01:51.189> annoying<00:01:51.399> rattle<00:01:51.880> which

00:01:52.080 --> 00:01:52.090 
ended up with that annoying rattle which

00:01:52.090 --> 00:01:54.149 
ended up with that annoying rattle which
I<00:01:52.479> personally<00:01:53.289> found<00:01:53.409> a<00:01:53.560> bit<00:01:53.679> embarrassing

00:01:54.149 --> 00:01:54.159 
I personally found a bit embarrassing

00:01:54.159 --> 00:01:55.889 
I personally found a bit embarrassing
but<00:01:54.340> I<00:01:54.729> think<00:01:54.999> that's<00:01:55.179> because<00:01:55.270> it's<00:01:55.539> my<00:01:55.659> bike

00:01:55.889 --> 00:01:55.899 
but I think that's because it's my bike

00:01:55.899 --> 00:01:57.359 
but I think that's because it's my bike
and<00:01:56.170> I<00:01:56.229> notice<00:01:56.530> all<00:01:56.649> these<00:01:56.829> little<00:01:56.950> things<00:01:57.249> a

00:01:57.359 --> 00:01:57.369 
and I notice all these little things a

00:01:57.369 --> 00:01:58.590 
and I notice all these little things a
bit<00:01:57.520> more<00:01:57.549> than<00:01:57.909> let's<00:01:58.210> say<00:01:58.270> some<00:01:58.479> random

00:01:58.590 --> 00:01:58.600 
bit more than let's say some random

00:01:58.600 --> 00:02:01.379 
bit more than let's say some random
passerby<00:01:59.109> would<00:01:59.259> but<00:02:00.219> once<00:02:00.670> I<00:02:00.819> did<00:02:00.880> flip<00:02:01.210> the

00:02:01.379 --> 00:02:01.389 
passerby would but once I did flip the

00:02:01.389 --> 00:02:03.989 
passerby would but once I did flip the
bolt<00:02:01.600> and<00:02:01.780> reseeded<00:02:02.530> the<00:02:02.619> gauge<00:02:02.829> I<00:02:03.130> never<00:02:03.789> did

00:02:03.989 --> 00:02:03.999 
bolt and reseeded the gauge I never did

00:02:03.999 --> 00:02:06.809
