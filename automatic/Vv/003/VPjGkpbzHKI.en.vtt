00:00:43.130 --> 00:00:43.140 
handicap bracket I would say the rocket

00:00:43.140 --> 00:00:46.250

00:03:53.269 --> 00:03:55.089 
in and also think about shafts if you're
into<00:03:53.510> those<00:03:53.659> kind<00:03:53.959> of<00:03:53.989> things<00:03:54.200> but<00:03:54.799> that<00:03:54.950> is

00:03:55.089 --> 00:03:55.099 
into those kind of things but that is

00:03:55.099 --> 00:03:57.160 
into those kind of things but that is
always<00:03:55.250> gonna<00:03:55.579> I<00:03:55.640> feel<00:03:55.819> and<00:03:56.599> I'll<00:03:56.689> test<00:03:56.959> them

00:03:57.160 --> 00:03:57.170 
always gonna I feel and I'll test them

00:03:57.170 --> 00:03:58.929 
always gonna I feel and I'll test them
hopefully<00:03:57.379> later<00:03:57.680> on<00:03:57.829> launch<00:03:58.250> monitors<00:03:58.700> as<00:03:58.819> we

00:03:58.929 --> 00:03:58.939 
hopefully later on launch monitors as we

00:03:58.939 --> 00:04:01.720 
hopefully later on launch monitors as we
get<00:03:59.090> going<00:03:59.120> more<00:03:59.689> I<00:04:00.620> feel<00:04:01.250> like<00:04:01.400> that<00:04:01.519> one

00:04:01.720 --> 00:04:01.730 
get going more I feel like that one

00:04:01.730 --> 00:04:04.119 
get going more I feel like that one
could<00:04:01.879> go<00:04:02.030> a<00:04:02.060> little<00:04:02.209> high<00:04:02.569> in<00:04:02.750> this<00:04:02.989> one<00:04:03.230> you

00:04:04.119 --> 00:04:04.129 
could go a little high in this one you

00:04:04.129 --> 00:04:10.390 
could go a little high in this one you
never<00:04:04.250> hit<00:04:07.629> lovely<00:04:08.629> face<00:04:09.319> this<00:04:09.470> club<00:04:09.769> I<00:04:10.010> do

00:04:10.390 --> 00:04:10.400 
never hit lovely face this club I do

00:04:10.400 --> 00:04:12.250 
never hit lovely face this club I do
love<00:04:10.879> the<00:04:11.030> Nike<00:04:11.329> Pro<00:04:11.480> combos<00:04:11.900> I<00:04:11.930> think<00:04:12.109> it's<00:04:12.200> a

00:04:12.250 --> 00:04:12.260 
love the Nike Pro combos I think it's a

00:04:12.260 --> 00:04:14.589 
love the Nike Pro combos I think it's a
great<00:04:12.500> set<00:04:12.739> of<00:04:12.769> eyes<00:04:12.980> so<00:04:13.819> let's<00:04:14.000> not<00:04:14.180> match<00:04:14.450> the

00:04:14.589 --> 00:04:14.599 
great set of eyes so let's not match the

00:04:14.599 --> 00:04:16.509 
great set of eyes so let's not match the
choosing<00:04:15.019> these<00:04:15.170> two<00:04:15.470> certainly<00:04:15.920> performance

00:04:16.509 --> 00:04:16.519 
choosing these two certainly performance

00:04:16.519 --> 00:04:19.629 
choosing these two certainly performance
I<00:04:16.669> would<00:04:16.729> say<00:04:17.000> slightly<00:04:17.419> lower<00:04:17.600> launch<00:04:18.639> but

00:04:19.629 --> 00:04:19.639 
I would say slightly lower launch but

00:04:19.639 --> 00:04:21.909 
I would say slightly lower launch but
fractional<00:04:20.389> and<00:04:21.229> that's<00:04:21.410> going<00:04:21.620> to<00:04:21.680> be<00:04:21.739> always

00:04:21.909 --> 00:04:21.919 
fractional and that's going to be always

00:04:21.919 --> 00:04:23.650 
fractional and that's going to be always
subject<00:04:22.460> to<00:04:22.520> the<00:04:22.669> numbers<00:04:22.970> that<00:04:23.090> you<00:04:23.270> produce

00:04:23.650 --> 00:04:23.660 
subject to the numbers that you produce

00:04:23.660 --> 00:04:26.830 
subject to the numbers that you produce
with<00:04:23.870> your<00:04:24.050> clubs<00:04:24.320> as<00:04:24.470> well<00:04:24.760> and<00:04:25.840> definitely

00:04:26.830 --> 00:04:26.840 
with your clubs as well and definitely

00:04:26.840 --> 00:04:30.790 
with your clubs as well and definitely
more<00:04:27.260> classic<00:04:27.800> looks<00:04:28.099> in<00:04:28.400> Nike<00:04:29.090> Pro<00:04:29.270> combo<00:04:29.990> but

00:04:30.790 --> 00:04:30.800 
more classic looks in Nike Pro combo but

00:04:30.800 --> 00:04:32.110 
more classic looks in Nike Pro combo but
that's<00:04:31.039> not<00:04:31.250> to<00:04:31.340> take<00:04:31.520> away<00:04:31.669> from<00:04:31.910> the<00:04:31.970> rocket

00:04:32.110 --> 00:04:32.120 
that's not to take away from the rocket

00:04:32.120 --> 00:04:33.580 
that's not to take away from the rocket
blades<00:04:32.389> so<00:04:32.539> I<00:04:32.570> think<00:04:32.660> looking<00:04:32.870> based<00:04:33.169> or<00:04:33.380> looks

00:04:33.580 --> 00:04:33.590 
blades so I think looking based or looks

00:04:33.590 --> 00:04:35.230 
blades so I think looking based or looks
like<00:04:33.680> a<00:04:33.830> solid<00:04:34.220> little<00:04:34.520> iron<00:04:34.760> down<00:04:35.000> by<00:04:35.180> the

00:04:35.230 --> 00:04:35.240 
like a solid little iron down by the

00:04:35.240 --> 00:04:37.620 
like a solid little iron down by the
ball<00:04:35.510> at<00:04:36.169> the<00:04:36.440> two<00:04:36.620> for<00:04:36.830> confidence-inspiring

00:04:37.620 --> 00:04:37.630 
ball at the two for confidence-inspiring

00:04:37.630 --> 00:04:40.300 
ball at the two for confidence-inspiring
definitely<00:04:38.630> rocket<00:04:38.870> red<00:04:39.020> pool<00:04:39.320> would<00:04:39.590> win<00:04:39.889> so

00:04:40.300 --> 00:04:40.310 
definitely rocket red pool would win so

00:04:40.310 --> 00:04:44.379 
definitely rocket red pool would win so
the<00:04:40.910> source<00:04:41.120> of<00:04:41.389> courses<00:04:41.720> isn't<00:04:41.930> it<00:04:43.240> with<00:04:44.240> all

00:04:44.379 --> 00:04:44.389 
the source of courses isn't it with all
