00:00:55.069 --> 00:00:55.079 
it right on top of that data roof or you

00:00:55.079 --> 00:00:56.840 
it right on top of that data roof or you
could<00:00:55.199> take<00:00:55.350> your<00:00:55.890> top<00:00:56.430> and<00:00:56.640> bottom

00:00:56.840 --> 00:00:56.850 
could take your top and bottom

00:00:56.850 --> 00:00:58.729 
could take your top and bottom
crosshairs<00:00:57.329> and<00:00:57.420> line<00:00:57.660> it<00:00:57.690> up<00:00:57.870> with<00:00:58.050> this<00:00:58.350> tree

00:00:58.729 --> 00:00:58.739 
crosshairs and line it up with this tree

00:00:58.739 --> 00:01:01.610 
crosshairs and line it up with this tree
with<00:00:59.309> whatever<00:00:59.520> gun<00:00:59.850> you<00:00:59.940> have<00:00:59.969> so<00:01:00.930> this<00:01:01.320> blue

00:01:01.610 --> 00:01:01.620 
with whatever gun you have so this blue

00:01:01.620 --> 00:01:05.410 
with whatever gun you have so this blue
line<00:01:01.649> is<00:01:02.070> we're<00:01:02.370> gonna<00:01:02.520> want<00:01:02.699> to<00:01:02.789> line<00:01:02.969> it<00:01:03.000> up

00:01:05.410 --> 00:01:05.420 

00:01:05.420 --> 00:01:09.109 

so<00:01:06.420> the<00:01:06.689> tree<00:01:07.080> the<00:01:07.350> blue<00:01:07.530> line<00:01:07.740> boom<00:01:08.159> this<00:01:08.970> is

00:01:09.109 --> 00:01:09.119 
so the tree the blue line boom this is

00:01:09.119 --> 00:01:10.580 
so the tree the blue line boom this is
long<00:01:09.270> as<00:01:09.360> I<00:01:09.450> like<00:01:09.750> that<00:01:09.900> and<00:01:10.350> you're<00:01:10.409> going<00:01:10.530> to

00:01:10.580 --> 00:01:10.590 
long as I like that and you're going to

00:01:10.590 --> 00:01:15.530 
long as I like that and you're going to
slightly<00:01:10.890> walk<00:01:11.729> back<00:01:12.000> and<00:01:12.330> jump<00:01:13.320> spin<00:01:14.310> left<00:01:14.610> do

00:01:15.530 --> 00:01:15.540 
slightly walk back and jump spin left do

00:01:15.540 --> 00:01:17.420 
slightly walk back and jump spin left do
not<00:01:15.659> spin<00:01:15.930> right<00:01:16.110> on<00:01:16.290> the<00:01:16.409> shot<00:01:16.619> it<00:01:17.009> will<00:01:17.280> not

00:01:17.420 --> 00:01:17.430 
not spin right on the shot it will not

00:01:17.430 --> 00:01:19.789 
not spin right on the shot it will not
hit<00:01:17.640> as<00:01:17.790> clean<00:01:18.299> but<00:01:18.840> it<00:01:18.990> could<00:01:19.140> probably<00:01:19.409> hit

00:01:19.789 --> 00:01:19.799 
hit as clean but it could probably hit

00:01:19.799 --> 00:01:22.429 
hit as clean but it could probably hit
but<00:01:20.009> it'll<00:01:20.220> is<00:01:20.490> sloppy<00:01:20.759> and<00:01:21.020> also<00:01:22.020> there<00:01:22.409> are

00:01:22.429 --> 00:01:22.439 
but it'll is sloppy and also there are

00:01:22.439 --> 00:01:25.030 
but it'll is sloppy and also there are
some<00:01:22.710> other<00:01:22.830> things<00:01:22.890> you<00:01:23.220> can<00:01:23.430> and<00:01:23.490> can't<00:01:23.909> do

00:01:25.030 --> 00:01:25.040 
some other things you can and can't do

00:01:25.040 --> 00:01:28.370 
some other things you can and can't do
you<00:01:26.040> can<00:01:26.310> do<00:01:27.000> like<00:01:27.689> when<00:01:27.900> you<00:01:27.960> hit<00:01:28.080> a<00:01:28.110> lot<00:01:28.259> of

00:01:28.370 --> 00:01:28.380 
you can do like when you hit a lot of

00:01:28.380 --> 00:01:29.630 
you can do like when you hit a lot of
spin<00:01:28.619> in<00:01:28.710> opposite<00:01:28.979> direction<00:01:29.100> but<00:01:29.490> you

00:01:29.630 --> 00:01:29.640 
spin in opposite direction but you

00:01:29.640 --> 00:01:32.480 
spin in opposite direction but you
cannot<00:01:30.049> sprint<00:01:31.049> in<00:01:31.350> the<00:01:31.530> mid<00:01:31.740> air<00:01:31.950> if<00:01:32.189> you

00:01:32.480 --> 00:01:32.490 
cannot sprint in the mid air if you

00:01:32.490 --> 00:01:34.219 
cannot sprint in the mid air if you
sprint<00:01:32.880> emitter<00:01:33.150> you<00:01:33.360> will<00:01:33.479> not<00:01:33.630> hit<00:01:33.930> the

00:01:34.219 --> 00:01:34.229 
sprint emitter you will not hit the

00:01:34.229 --> 00:01:35.660 
sprint emitter you will not hit the
ladder<00:01:34.439> the<00:01:34.680> same<00:01:34.890> way<00:01:35.070> that<00:01:35.220> you<00:01:35.369> would<00:01:35.400> if

00:01:35.660 --> 00:01:35.670 
ladder the same way that you would if

00:01:35.670 --> 00:01:38.300 
ladder the same way that you would if
you<00:01:35.700> didn't<00:01:36.119> sprint<00:01:36.439> actually<00:01:37.439> see<00:01:38.009> cuz<00:01:38.220> you

00:01:38.300 --> 00:01:38.310 
you didn't sprint actually see cuz you

00:01:38.310 --> 00:01:40.600 
you didn't sprint actually see cuz you
could<00:01:38.430> barely<00:01:38.579> hit<00:01:38.820> the<00:01:38.939> lottery<00:01:39.090> sprint<00:01:39.630> and

00:01:40.600 --> 00:01:40.610 
could barely hit the lottery sprint and

00:01:40.610 --> 00:01:43.819 
could barely hit the lottery sprint and
