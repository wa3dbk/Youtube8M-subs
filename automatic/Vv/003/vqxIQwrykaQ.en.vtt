I'm okay with this I think it's a little
plain<00:03:57.900> if<00:03:58.440> you're<00:03:58.650> given<00:03:58.980> an<00:03:59.160> opportunity<00:03:59.850> to

00:03:59.930 --> 00:03:59.940 
plain if you're given an opportunity to

00:03:59.940 --> 00:04:01.190 
plain if you're given an opportunity to
do<00:04:00.030> black<00:04:00.209> and<00:04:00.269> why<00:04:00.540> are<00:04:00.600> you<00:04:00.750> just<00:04:00.930> gonna<00:04:00.989> do

00:04:01.190 --> 00:04:01.200 
do black and why are you just gonna do

00:04:01.200 --> 00:04:02.660 
do black and why are you just gonna do
bunch<00:04:01.380> of<00:04:01.500> straps<00:04:01.769> or<00:04:02.130> are<00:04:02.280> you<00:04:02.370> gonna<00:04:02.459> give

bit deficient the actual execution of

00:04:08.489 --> 00:04:10.460 
bit deficient the actual execution of
