curious what's going to happen

00:01:35.380 --> 00:01:38.500 
curious what's going to happen
we<00:01:36.380> are<00:01:36.500> indeed<00:01:36.740> and<00:01:37.040> they<00:01:37.520> did<00:01:37.909> in<00:01:38.150> fact<00:01:38.180> say

00:01:38.500 --> 00:01:38.510 
we are indeed and they did in fact say

00:01:38.510 --> 00:01:39.970 
we are indeed and they did in fact say
the<00:01:38.659> same<00:01:38.810> thing<00:01:38.990> about<00:01:39.080> Heath<00:01:39.380> Ledger<00:01:39.650> and

00:01:39.970 --> 00:01:39.980 
the same thing about Heath Ledger and

00:01:39.980 --> 00:01:42.340 
the same thing about Heath Ledger and
and<00:01:40.520> about<00:01:40.970> Michael<00:01:41.630> Keaton<00:01:41.900> back<00:01:42.020> in<00:01:42.170> the<00:01:42.230> day

and about Michael Keaton back in the day

00:01:42.350 --> 00:01:45.340 
and about Michael Keaton back in the day
so<00:01:42.409> I<00:01:43.040> guess<00:01:43.580> we<00:01:43.850> can<00:01:44.000> expect<00:01:44.360> that<00:01:44.570> they<00:01:45.140> might

00:01:45.340 --> 00:01:45.350 
so I guess we can expect that they might

00:01:45.350 --> 00:01:47.260 
so I guess we can expect that they might
Ben<00:01:46.100> Affleck<00:01:46.370> might<00:01:46.550> hit<00:01:46.729> it<00:01:46.760> out<00:01:46.940> of<00:01:47.000> the<00:01:47.060> park

Ben Affleck might hit it out of the park

00:01:47.270 --> 00:01:49.899 
Ben Affleck might hit it out of the park
in<00:01:47.390> the<00:01:47.450> end<00:01:47.830> so<00:01:48.830> let's<00:01:48.860> go<00:01:49.310> back<00:01:49.490> to<00:01:49.640> a<00:01:49.670> little

00:01:49.899 --> 00:01:49.909 
in the end so let's go back to a little
