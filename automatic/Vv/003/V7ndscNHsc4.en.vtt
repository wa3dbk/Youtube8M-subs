00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.080
 on the other side we find ourselves behind 

00:00:01.560 --> 00:00:06.600
 he said go find he went to 

00:00:04.080 --> 00:00:09.630
 find the authors and is running from Rome 

00:00:06.600 --> 00:00:10.530
 torino we have to talk about ourselves to come 

00:00:09.630 --> 00:00:13.230
 here 

00:00:10.530 --> 00:00:14.820
 you have to come to factor races in the meantime 

00:00:13.230 --> 00:00:17.670
 let's introduce his story because 

00:00:14.820 --> 00:00:22.650
 we also have his photos 

00:00:17.670 --> 00:00:24.300
 and then our turin is a goose 

00:00:22.650 --> 00:00:26.849
 Meanwhile our doctor leaves because 

00:00:24.300 --> 00:00:30.750
 rightly we have to talk about him and 

00:00:26.849 --> 00:00:34.260
 he has to take has become 

00:00:30.750 --> 00:00:37.110
 of national domain because what it is 

00:00:34.260 --> 00:00:39.510
 success has happened a story or that 

00:00:37.110 --> 00:00:42.690
 our ice cream also comes 

00:00:39.510 --> 00:00:45.600
 so at least our doctor stands 

00:00:42.690 --> 00:00:46.770
 However close we speak of the history 

00:00:45.600 --> 00:00:51.650
 in the intervention because we talk about it 

00:00:46.770 --> 00:00:55.670
 in the angel I explain why 

00:00:51.650 --> 00:00:58.010
 an otorino night that has its name 

00:00:55.670 --> 00:01:00.800
 art that by now and beak of copper comes 

00:00:58.010 --> 00:01:02.690
 attacked by a fox is practically the 

00:01:00.800 --> 00:01:05.630
 fox splits the piece above the beak 

00:01:02.690 --> 00:01:08.780
 and therefore practically in the morning the 

00:01:05.630 --> 00:01:13.130
 owner of turin that of iveco of 

00:01:08.780 --> 00:01:16.040
 copper finds in turin without the 

00:01:13.130 --> 00:01:17.690
 upstairs he hoped the food 

00:01:16.040 --> 00:01:20.240
 amiable photos in fact they stand 

00:01:17.690 --> 00:01:22.670
 flowing for ten days comes 

00:01:20.240 --> 00:01:26.180
 so very hand fed 

00:01:22.670 --> 00:01:28.369
 care and then decide to come by 

00:01:26.180 --> 00:01:31.610
 veterinarian considering that he is an animal 

00:01:28.369 --> 00:01:35.140
 from meat and therefore could practically 

00:01:31.610 --> 00:01:39.800
 even an end here is another end instead 

00:01:35.140 --> 00:01:41.750
 this time has come to my office and 

00:01:39.800 --> 00:01:44.150
 honestly I really wanted to do 

00:01:41.750 --> 00:01:46.850
 something special and I am 

00:01:44.150 --> 00:01:50.150
 made to leave and I was inspired by 

00:01:46.850 --> 00:01:51.979
 of the copper plates I had and are 

00:01:50.150 --> 00:01:55.280
 managed to make a prosthesis to mount it 

00:01:51.979 --> 00:01:57.590
 after a few hours already from small branch e 

00:01:55.280 --> 00:01:59.800
 he ate and we practically understood 

00:01:57.590 --> 00:02:01.700
 which was a success I would like to know 

00:01:59.800 --> 00:02:05.060
 doctors 

00:02:01.700 --> 00:02:08.450
 before this happened 

00:02:05.060 --> 00:02:11.390
 yes, yes, but that was almost like 

00:02:08.450 --> 00:02:14.660
 guard in this chicken coop and that then 

00:02:11.390 --> 00:02:17.420
 she was very sure of herself and since 

00:02:14.660 --> 00:02:21.230
 the backbone has been torn off 

00:02:17.420 --> 00:02:27.200
 lost his strength in inverted commas his 

00:02:21.230 --> 00:02:30.140
 character and dominance and therefore this 

00:02:27.200 --> 00:02:30.920
 this fox took away all his 

00:02:30.140 --> 00:02:35.209
 safety 

00:02:30.920 --> 00:02:36.680
 indeed, after surgery, he was her 

00:02:35.209 --> 00:02:39.500
 because we are talking about a male 

00:02:36.680 --> 00:02:41.420
 male later also a female was 

00:02:39.500 --> 00:02:44.090
 we have liquidated instead have 

00:02:41.420 --> 00:02:46.880
 regained this energy 

00:02:44.090 --> 00:02:49.640
 but here they have great intelligence 

00:02:46.880 --> 00:02:50.959
 of these animals has shown them 

00:02:49.640 --> 00:02:51.860
 immediately perceived the 

00:02:50.959 --> 00:02:53.840
 prosthesis 

00:02:51.860 --> 00:02:56.180
 then they tried it saw that 

00:02:53.840 --> 00:02:58.280
 also in the acts of dominance with the 

00:02:56.180 --> 00:03:00.500
 other animals were right and have 

00:02:58.280 --> 00:03:03.950
 in fact, they have become dominant 

00:03:00.500 --> 00:03:06.680
 he had a conflict with the cock and this 

00:03:03.950 --> 00:03:11.299
 rooster now has all his i's 

00:03:06.680 --> 00:03:14.810
 his attacks and fabio gallo was that 

00:03:11.299 --> 00:03:17.720
 that certainly dominated her with this 

00:03:14.810 --> 00:03:21.430
 small bionic precisely dominate the rooster 

00:03:17.720 --> 00:03:23.480
 and the cat to all beauties all 

00:03:21.430 --> 00:03:25.819
 tear in the back and then 

00:03:23.480 --> 00:03:29.019
 completely the other one those by now 

00:03:25.819 --> 00:03:31.519
 the person in charge is otorino son then 

00:03:29.019 --> 00:03:35.170
 we also say they are following us 

00:03:31.519 --> 00:03:39.859
 certainly via the owners streaming 

00:03:35.170 --> 00:03:42.200
 there are a thousand lady paola who have 

00:03:39.859 --> 00:03:44.239
 truly an incredible love for 

00:03:42.200 --> 00:03:47.239
 I wanted to greet Fra Signora Paola 

00:03:44.239 --> 00:03:49.819
 in short, it is not for everyone 

00:03:47.239 --> 00:03:52.430
 run to the veterinary doctor or a 

00:03:49.819 --> 00:03:54.560
 goose and therefore his love feeling 

00:03:52.430 --> 00:03:56.959
 for this animal and the flow from her i 

00:03:54.560 --> 00:03:58.579
 they are the real protagonists because they 

00:03:56.959 --> 00:04:00.190
 they wanted the cures they wanted 

00:03:58.579 --> 00:04:02.920
 surgery 

00:04:00.190 --> 00:04:03.870
 the maximum improves also says that not 

00:04:02.920 --> 00:04:06.010
 wants 

00:04:03.870 --> 00:04:09.130
 let him also free our a 

00:04:06.010 --> 00:04:12.430
 torino at least mathematically here they have 

00:04:09.130 --> 00:04:14.410
 wanted they absolutely wanted the 

00:04:12.430 --> 00:04:17.980
 happiness of a meat animal that 

00:04:14.410 --> 00:04:19.989
 precisely as an incredible story because i 

00:04:17.980 --> 00:04:22.240
 owners of these animals can 

00:04:19.989 --> 00:04:23.410
 make different decisions 

00:04:22.240 --> 00:04:26.260
 while they absolutely wanted 

00:04:23.410 --> 00:04:28.990
 that maximum and maximum were made 

00:04:26.260 --> 00:04:31.180
 has brought salvation and also to 

00:04:28.990 --> 00:04:32.050
 make a particular intervention because it is 

00:04:31.180 --> 00:04:34.270
 unique in the world 

00:04:32.050 --> 00:04:37.660
 it was this great one 

00:04:34.270 --> 00:04:39.910
 profile opportunity to enter the 

00:04:37.660 --> 00:04:41.740
 world in the world of prostheses such as the 

00:04:39.910 --> 00:04:43.870
 alloy that had so beak that then 

00:04:41.740 --> 00:04:47.860
 even paying on other birds can 

00:04:43.870 --> 00:04:50.110
 therefore it is a solution 

00:04:47.860 --> 00:04:51.460
 because often there is their beak 

00:04:50.110 --> 00:04:53.410
 they do everything we do not see ours now 

00:04:51.460 --> 00:04:55.420
 parrot that is cleaning me first 

00:04:53.410 --> 00:04:57.370
 he was taking off his glasses then them 

00:04:55.420 --> 00:04:59.770
 rightly for dominance and therefore it is 

00:04:57.370 --> 00:05:01.930
 an excellent solution and therefore we do 

00:04:59.770 --> 00:05:03.610
 also see how the world sphere 

00:05:01.930 --> 00:05:07.930
 application surgical veterinarian is 

00:05:03.610 --> 00:05:10.210
 our degree really weighs therefore 

00:05:07.930 --> 00:05:12.040
 then among other things is the work has been 

00:05:10.210 --> 00:05:14.470
 published on an American list thanks 

00:05:12.040 --> 00:05:16.090
 to also the collaboration precisely with 

00:05:14.470 --> 00:05:19.240
 the pathology institute vary by 

00:05:16.090 --> 00:05:21.669
 great trust and great satisfaction 

00:05:19.240 --> 00:05:25.390
 international reputation and in 

00:05:21.669 --> 00:05:29.730
 the more a fairy tale is born, that's it 

00:05:25.390 --> 00:05:34.300
 creating a fairy tale already innate many 

00:05:29.730 --> 00:05:36.580
 let's say interested publishers and this 

00:05:34.300 --> 00:05:38.770
 really not just for kids that it is 

00:05:36.580 --> 00:05:41.230
 practically the first fable that has one 

00:05:38.770 --> 00:05:44.260
 true story behind this fairy tale 

00:05:41.230 --> 00:05:48.040
 really interrupts interrupting this 

00:05:44.260 --> 00:05:49.660
 cycle cycle of virtual fairy tales yes 

00:05:48.040 --> 00:05:51.669
 they are all world-wide 

00:05:49.660 --> 00:05:54.970
 these invented fables this is one 

00:05:51.669 --> 00:05:57.400
 beautiful fairy tale that the true story is 

00:05:54.970 --> 00:06:02.009
 that to this and that will give to children 

00:05:57.400 --> 00:06:04.750
 really very concrete just in the 

00:06:02.009 --> 00:06:07.840
 here in a fantastic but real world 

00:06:04.750 --> 00:06:09.819
 that's what binds the october to Umbria 

00:06:07.840 --> 00:06:12.610
 our doctor brigands are of 

00:06:09.819 --> 00:06:13.120
 spoleto said he was working however 

00:06:12.610 --> 00:06:15.009
 tumors 

00:06:13.120 --> 00:06:16.770
 we also have a clinic here in campello 

00:06:15.009 --> 00:06:19.150
 on the clitunno however fundamentally 

00:06:16.770 --> 00:06:20.319
 here I am again on two of his tops 

00:06:19.150 --> 00:06:23.129
 way are two regions 

00:06:20.319 --> 00:06:23.129
 good good good
