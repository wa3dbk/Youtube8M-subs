this conveyor this is a very useful

this conveyor this is a very useful
feature<00:06:55.729> but<00:06:56.299> you<00:06:56.360> should<00:06:56.539> keep<00:06:56.659> in<00:06:56.839> mind<00:06:57.049> that

feature but you should keep in mind that

00:06:57.289 --> 00:06:59.259 
feature but you should keep in mind that
it<00:06:57.439> alters<00:06:57.799> the<00:06:57.829> original<00:06:58.309> wavelength<00:06:58.519> in

00:07:01.539 --> 00:07:01.549 
recent software's I think the key lock

00:07:01.549 --> 00:07:03.609 
recent software's I think the key lock
sounds<00:07:01.849> pretty<00:07:02.089> good<00:07:02.269> up<00:07:02.419> to<00:07:02.539> 5%<00:07:02.869> speed<00:07:03.319> change

00:07:03.609 --> 00:07:03.619 
sounds pretty good up to 5% speed change

00:07:03.619 --> 00:07:06.459 
sounds pretty good up to 5% speed change
but<00:07:04.339> that's<00:07:04.549> me<00:07:04.759> so<00:07:05.119> ultimately<00:07:05.419> the<00:07:06.049> decision

00:07:06.459 --> 00:07:06.469 
but that's me so ultimately the decision
