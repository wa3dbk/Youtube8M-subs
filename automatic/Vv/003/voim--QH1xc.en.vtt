so<00:00:42.420> the<00:00:42.540> crane<00:00:42.750> stock<00:00:43.020> batteries<00:00:43.620> are<00:00:43.980> meant

00:00:44.450 --> 00:00:44.460 
so the crane stock batteries are meant

00:00:44.460 --> 00:00:47.110 
so the crane stock batteries are meant
to<00:00:44.610> go<00:00:44.760> in<00:00:44.879> something<00:00:45.329> that<00:00:45.360> looked<00:00:45.570> like<00:00:45.890> this

00:00:47.110 --> 00:00:47.120 
to go in something that looked like this

00:00:47.120 --> 00:00:50.959 
to go in something that looked like this
you<00:00:48.120> insert<00:00:48.480> it<00:00:48.510> there<00:00:48.899> and<00:00:49.170> you<00:00:49.670> close<00:00:50.670> it<00:00:50.700> and

00:00:50.959 --> 00:00:50.969 
you insert it there and you close it and

00:00:50.969 --> 00:00:53.660 
you insert it there and you close it and
put<00:00:51.149> it<00:00:51.180> on<00:00:51.360> the<00:00:51.449> back<00:00:51.629> of<00:00:51.660> the<00:00:51.840> gun<00:00:52.020> and<00:00:52.670> that's

00:00:53.660 --> 00:00:53.670 
put it on the back of the gun and that's

00:00:53.670 --> 00:00:56.029 
put it on the back of the gun and that's
how<00:00:53.789> that<00:00:53.850> one<00:00:54.120> works<00:00:54.300> and<00:00:54.660> this<00:00:55.379> one<00:00:55.620> it<00:00:55.829> goes

00:00:56.029 --> 00:00:56.039 
how that one works and this one it goes

00:00:56.039 --> 00:01:00.290 
how that one works and this one it goes
in<00:00:56.190> the<00:00:56.280> hand<00:00:56.699> grip<00:00:57.289> which<00:00:58.289> is<00:00:58.969> on<00:00:59.969> the<00:01:00.059> front

00:01:00.290 --> 00:01:00.300 
in the hand grip which is on the front

00:01:00.300 --> 00:01:02.689 
in the hand grip which is on the front
of<00:01:00.420> the<00:01:00.510> gun<00:01:00.719> and<00:01:01.020> it<00:01:01.440> separates<00:01:02.160> and<00:01:02.430> you<00:01:02.489> put

00:01:02.689 --> 00:01:02.699 
of the gun and it separates and you put

00:01:02.699 --> 00:01:05.210 
of the gun and it separates and you put
this<00:01:02.820> in<00:01:03.030> there<00:01:03.180> attach<00:01:03.600> it<00:01:03.840> and<00:01:03.930> shut<00:01:04.290> it<00:01:04.320> this

00:01:05.210 --> 00:01:05.220 
this in there attach it and shut it this

00:01:05.220 --> 00:01:07.670 
this in there attach it and shut it this
usually<00:01:05.489> goes<00:01:05.909> into<00:01:06.240> the<00:01:06.330> stock<00:01:06.720> of<00:01:07.049> a<00:01:07.140> gun<00:01:07.380> a

00:01:07.670 --> 00:01:07.680 
usually goes into the stock of a gun a

00:01:07.680 --> 00:01:10.520 
usually goes into the stock of a gun a
full<00:01:08.490> stock<00:01:08.820> or<00:01:09.390> sometimes<00:01:10.140> people<00:01:10.470> have

00:01:10.520 --> 00:01:10.530 
full stock or sometimes people have

00:01:10.530 --> 00:01:13.160 
full stock or sometimes people have
battery<00:01:10.920> pouches<00:01:11.460> and<00:01:11.729> they<00:01:12.659> put<00:01:12.840> it<00:01:12.960> in<00:01:13.049> the

00:01:13.160 --> 00:01:13.170 
battery pouches and they put it in the

00:01:13.170 --> 00:01:16.249 
battery pouches and they put it in the
battery<00:01:13.470> pouch<00:01:14.060> but<00:01:15.060> it's<00:01:15.450> not<00:01:15.600> more<00:01:15.900> that's

00:01:16.249 --> 00:01:16.259 
battery pouch but it's not more that's

00:01:16.259 --> 00:01:19.010 
battery pouch but it's not more that's
not<00:01:16.439> as<00:01:16.590> likely<00:01:16.770> as<00:01:16.979> a<00:01:17.159> stock<00:01:17.610> I<00:01:18.000> use<00:01:18.750> a<00:01:18.780> battery

00:01:19.010 --> 00:01:19.020 
not as likely as a stock I use a battery

00:01:19.020 --> 00:01:22.940 
not as likely as a stock I use a battery
pouch<00:01:19.380> but<00:01:19.770> and<00:01:20.040> here<00:01:20.820> is<00:01:21.000> a<00:01:21.030> 9.6<00:01:21.840> volt<00:01:22.110> 4200

00:01:22.940 --> 00:01:22.950 
pouch but and here is a 9.6 volt 4200

00:01:22.950 --> 00:01:25.030 
pouch but and here is a 9.6 volt 4200
mall<00:01:23.130> it's<00:01:23.820> the<00:01:23.939> biggest<00:01:24.060> battery<00:01:24.570> I<00:01:24.659> have

00:01:25.030 --> 00:01:25.040 
mall it's the biggest battery I have

00:01:25.040 --> 00:01:29.569 
mall it's the biggest battery I have
it's<00:01:26.040> a<00:01:26.159> great<00:01:26.580> battery<00:01:27.470> it<00:01:28.470> can't<00:01:29.220> fit<00:01:29.430> in

00:01:29.569 --> 00:01:29.579 
it's a great battery it can't fit in

00:01:29.579 --> 00:01:32.300 
it's a great battery it can't fit in
most<00:01:29.700> stocks<00:01:30.119> but<00:01:30.750> battery<00:01:31.409> pouches<00:01:32.009> are<00:01:32.130> used

00:01:32.300 --> 00:01:32.310 
most stocks but battery pouches are used

00:01:32.310 --> 00:01:34.399 
most stocks but battery pouches are used
for<00:01:32.490> this<00:01:32.670> one<00:01:32.880> which<00:01:33.509> is<00:01:33.540> what<00:01:33.810> I<00:01:33.840> have<00:01:34.140> and

00:01:34.399 --> 00:01:34.409 
for this one which is what I have and

00:01:34.409 --> 00:01:37.039 
for this one which is what I have and
they<00:01:34.470> were<00:01:34.530> really<00:01:35.040> great<00:01:35.490> I<00:01:35.759> make<00:01:36.570> some<00:01:36.869> of

00:01:37.039 --> 00:01:37.049 
they were really great I make some of

00:01:37.049 --> 00:01:39.020 
they were really great I make some of
them<00:01:37.170> I<00:01:37.380> might<00:01:37.770> have<00:01:37.920> a<00:01:37.979> tutorial<00:01:38.369> on<00:01:38.790> how<00:01:38.850> to

00:01:39.020 --> 00:01:39.030 
them I might have a tutorial on how to

00:01:39.030 --> 00:01:43.190 
them I might have a tutorial on how to
make<00:01:39.329> them<00:01:39.540> and<00:01:39.720> how<00:01:39.780> to<00:01:39.840> wire<00:01:40.110> them<00:01:40.439> so<00:01:42.200> first

00:01:43.190 --> 00:01:43.200 
make them and how to wire them so first

00:01:43.200 --> 00:01:45.800 
make them and how to wire them so first
of<00:01:43.380> all<00:01:43.500> this<00:01:43.829> is<00:01:44.009> a<00:01:44.070> 9.6<00:01:44.759> volt<00:01:45.060> now<00:01:45.750> the

00:01:45.800 --> 00:01:45.810 
of all this is a 9.6 volt now the

00:01:45.810 --> 00:01:48.620 
of all this is a 9.6 volt now the
voltage<00:01:46.520> determines<00:01:47.520> how<00:01:47.670> fast<00:01:47.700> the<00:01:48.420> gun

00:01:48.620 --> 00:01:48.630 
voltage determines how fast the gun

00:01:48.630 --> 00:01:52.370 
voltage determines how fast the gun
shoots<00:01:48.990> like<00:01:49.770> ready<00:01:50.700> to<00:01:50.759> fire<00:01:51.030> wise<00:01:51.360> this<00:01:52.170> is<00:01:52.350> a

00:01:52.370 --> 00:01:52.380 
shoots like ready to fire wise this is a

00:01:52.380 --> 00:01:55.160 
shoots like ready to fire wise this is a
9.6<00:01:53.100> volt<00:01:53.340> these<00:01:54.000> two<00:01:54.240> or<00:01:54.390> eight<00:01:54.600> point<00:01:54.899> fours

00:01:55.160 --> 00:01:55.170 
9.6 volt these two or eight point fours

00:01:55.170 --> 00:01:58.789 
9.6 volt these two or eight point fours
and<00:01:55.409> this<00:01:55.500> is<00:01:55.590> another<00:01:55.799> 9.6<00:01:57.049> i'm<00:01:58.049> probably

00:01:58.789 --> 00:01:58.799 
and this is another 9.6 i'm probably

00:01:58.799 --> 00:02:00.649 
and this is another 9.6 i'm probably
soon<00:01:59.130> going<00:01:59.340> to<00:01:59.399> be<00:01:59.520> getting<00:01:59.640> a<00:01:59.820> 10.8<00:02:00.450> volt

00:02:00.649 --> 00:02:00.659 
soon going to be getting a 10.8 volt

00:02:00.659 --> 00:02:03.139 
soon going to be getting a 10.8 volt
battery<00:02:01.079> and<00:02:01.259> maybe<00:02:01.409> a<00:02:01.530> lipo<00:02:02.009> lipo<00:02:02.460> like

00:02:03.139 --> 00:02:03.149 
battery and maybe a lipo lipo like

00:02:03.149 --> 00:02:07.249 
battery and maybe a lipo lipo like
lithium<00:02:03.689> polymer<00:02:04.049> battery<00:02:04.619> and<00:02:05.750> those<00:02:06.750> the

lithium polymer battery and those the

00:02:07.259 --> 00:02:09.740 
lithium polymer battery and those the
rate<00:02:07.439> of<00:02:07.469> fire<00:02:07.710> on<00:02:07.950> those<00:02:08.099> is<00:02:08.310> crazy<00:02:08.819> so<00:02:09.360> when<00:02:09.720> i

00:02:09.740 --> 00:02:09.750 
rate of fire on those is crazy so when i

00:02:09.750 --> 00:02:12.199 
rate of fire on those is crazy so when i
get<00:02:09.989> one<00:02:10.110> of<00:02:10.229> those<00:02:10.319> i'll<00:02:10.560> show<00:02:11.160> y'all<00:02:11.400> a<00:02:11.640> video

get one of those i'll show y'all a video

00:02:12.209 --> 00:02:13.760 
get one of those i'll show y'all a video
of<00:02:12.300> the<00:02:12.660> shooting

00:02:13.760 --> 00:02:13.770 
of the shooting

the 8.4 volt and 9.6 volt with two

00:02:22.920 --> 00:02:24.590 
the 8.4 volt and 9.6 volt with two
different<00:02:23.220> guns<00:02:23.340> to<00:02:23.640> stack<00:02:23.880> 15<00:02:24.360> the

00:02:24.590 --> 00:02:24.600 
different guns to stack 15 the

00:02:24.600 --> 00:02:29.330 
different guns to stack 15 the
customized<00:02:25.140> one<00:02:25.470> and<00:02:25.740> a<00:02:26.460> kwa<00:02:27.230> so<00:02:28.230> we're<00:02:29.220> going

00:02:29.330 --> 00:02:29.340 
customized one and a kwa so we're going

00:02:29.340 --> 00:02:32.300 
customized one and a kwa so we're going
to<00:02:29.430> see<00:02:29.640> which<00:02:29.790> one's<00:02:30.000> faster<00:02:30.090> and<00:02:31.040> by<00:02:32.040> how

00:02:32.300 --> 00:02:32.310 
to see which one's faster and by how

00:02:32.310 --> 00:02:34.040 
to see which one's faster and by how
much<00:02:32.340> they're<00:02:32.940> faster<00:02:33.420> and<00:02:33.600> if<00:02:33.690> it's<00:02:33.840> worth

00:02:34.040 --> 00:02:34.050 
much they're faster and if it's worth

00:02:34.050 --> 00:02:38.330 
much they're faster and if it's worth
getting<00:02:34.290> a<00:02:34.530> 9.6<00:02:35.250> instead<00:02:36.120> of<00:02:36.210> an<00:02:36.330> 8.4<00:02:37.160> you<00:02:38.160> can

00:02:38.330 --> 00:02:38.340 
getting a 9.6 instead of an 8.4 you can

00:02:38.340 --> 00:02:41.240 
getting a 9.6 instead of an 8.4 you can
decide<00:02:38.640> that<00:02:38.670> so<00:02:39.450> here<00:02:40.320> we<00:02:40.350> go<00:02:40.710> we're<00:02:40.920> about<00:02:41.100> to

00:02:41.240 --> 00:02:41.250 
decide that so here we go we're about to

00:02:41.250 --> 00:03:13.830 
decide that so here we go we're about to
shoot<00:02:41.430> two<00:02:41.970> guns

00:03:13.830 --> 00:03:13.840 

00:03:13.840 --> 00:03:15.900
