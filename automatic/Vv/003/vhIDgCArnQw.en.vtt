take<00:01:34.920> it<00:01:35.070> first<00:01:35.280> time<00:01:35.490> with<00:01:35.700> his<00:01:35.790> left<00:01:36.000> foot<00:01:36.060> it

00:01:36.770 --> 00:01:36.780 
take it first time with his left foot it

00:01:36.780 --> 00:01:39.260 
take it first time with his left foot it
was<00:01:36.960> a<00:01:36.990> fantastic<00:01:37.530> finish<00:01:38.280> you<00:01:38.610> also<00:01:38.790> scored

00:01:39.260 --> 00:01:39.270 
was a fantastic finish you also scored

00:01:39.270 --> 00:01:40.580 
was a fantastic finish you also scored
in<00:01:39.450> the<00:01:39.509> second<00:01:39.840> half<00:01:39.960> and<00:01:40.140> I<00:01:40.229> think<00:01:40.439> that's

00:01:40.580 --> 00:01:40.590 
in the second half and I think that's

00:01:40.590 --> 00:01:42.889 
in the second half and I think that's
one<00:01:40.710> of<00:01:40.740> the<00:01:40.829> areas<00:01:41.159> that<00:01:41.430> Arsenal<00:01:42.360> need<00:01:42.540> they

00:01:42.889 --> 00:01:42.899 
one of the areas that Arsenal need they

00:01:42.899 --> 00:01:44.840 
one of the areas that Arsenal need they
need<00:01:43.130> Podolski<00:01:44.130> to<00:01:44.310> score<00:01:44.640> this<00:01:44.790> season

00:01:44.840 --> 00:01:44.850 
need Podolski to score this season

00:01:44.850 --> 00:01:47.120 
need Podolski to score this season
because<00:01:45.720> he<00:01:45.930> ain't<00:01:46.020> played<00:01:46.200> a<00:01:46.229> login<00:01:46.680> /<00:01:46.799> der

00:01:47.120 --> 00:01:47.130 
because he ain't played a login / der

00:01:47.130 --> 00:01:48.350 
because he ain't played a login / der
and<00:01:47.250> it's<00:01:47.340> called<00:01:47.549> few<00:01:47.759> goals<00:01:47.939> but<00:01:48.090> you<00:01:48.180> never

00:01:48.350 --> 00:01:48.360 
and it's called few goals but you never

00:01:48.360 --> 00:01:50.330 
and it's called few goals but you never
school<00:01:48.630> enough<00:01:48.899> in<00:01:49.020> my<00:01:49.140> opinion<00:01:49.259> and<00:01:49.710> they

00:01:50.330 --> 00:01:50.340 
school enough in my opinion and they

00:01:50.340 --> 00:01:52.700 
school enough in my opinion and they
need<00:01:50.640> goals<00:01:51.090> from<00:01:51.360> players<00:01:52.049> like<00:01:52.290> Santi

00:01:52.700 --> 00:01:52.710 
need goals from players like Santi

00:01:52.710 --> 00:01:55.850

very very well today bars are no fun i'd
be<00:02:06.329> very<00:02:06.360> optimistic<00:02:06.899> with<00:02:07.680> the<00:02:07.770> squad<00:02:08.039> i'll

00:02:08.150 --> 00:02:08.160 
be very optimistic with the squad i'll

00:02:08.160 --> 00:02:09.680 
be very optimistic with the squad i'll
still<00:02:08.429> see<00:02:08.610> that<00:02:08.759> you<00:02:08.879> know<00:02:08.970> they<00:02:09.179> do<00:02:09.509> have

00:02:09.680 --> 00:02:09.690 
still see that you know they do have

00:02:09.690 --> 00:02:11.930 
still see that you know they do have
some<00:02:09.929> gaping<00:02:10.440> issues<00:02:11.190> you<00:02:11.640> know<00:02:11.730> and<00:02:11.879> these

00:02:11.930 --> 00:02:11.940 
some gaping issues you know and these

00:02:11.940 --> 00:02:13.800 
some gaping issues you know and these
performances<00:02:12.569> do<00:02:12.750> not<00:02:13.050> cover

00:02:13.800 --> 00:02:13.810 
performances do not cover

00:02:13.810 --> 00:02:15.930 
performances do not cover
gaps<00:02:14.140> in<00:02:14.380> the<00:02:14.470> cracks<00:02:14.739> in<00:02:14.980> the<00:02:15.250> team<00:02:15.459> they

00:02:15.930 --> 00:02:15.940 
gaps in the cracks in the team they

00:02:15.940 --> 00:02:17.370 
gaps in the cracks in the team they
definitely<00:02:16.239> do<00:02:16.569> need<00:02:16.690> to<00:02:16.810> get<00:02:16.959> a<00:02:16.989> new<00:02:17.050> striker

00:02:17.370 --> 00:02:17.380 
definitely do need to get a new striker

00:02:17.380 --> 00:02:19.040 
definitely do need to get a new striker
because<00:02:17.830> they<00:02:17.890> don't<00:02:18.099> have<00:02:18.190> a<00:02:18.280> replacement

00:02:19.040 --> 00:02:19.050 
because they don't have a replacement

00:02:19.050 --> 00:02:22.740 
because they don't have a replacement
Olivier<00:02:20.050> shuru<00:02:20.260> or<00:02:20.709> the<00:02:21.239> young<00:02:22.239> kid<00:02:22.480> they<00:02:22.599> call

00:02:22.740 --> 00:02:22.750 
Olivier shuru or the young kid they call

00:02:22.750 --> 00:02:25.740 
Olivier shuru or the young kid they call
in<00:02:22.959> on<00:02:23.110> loan<00:02:23.830> then<00:02:24.550> obviously<00:02:24.760> Mayfield<00:02:25.480> I

00:02:25.740 --> 00:02:25.750 
in on loan then obviously Mayfield I

00:02:25.750 --> 00:02:26.940 
in on loan then obviously Mayfield I
think<00:02:25.989> you<00:02:26.050> need<00:02:26.200> to<00:02:26.230> strengthen<00:02:26.590> up<00:02:26.920> their

00:02:26.940 --> 00:02:26.950 
think you need to strengthen up their

00:02:26.950 --> 00:02:28.559 
think you need to strengthen up their
they<00:02:27.250> need<00:02:27.400> to<00:02:27.520> maybe<00:02:27.670> when<00:02:27.910> i<00:02:27.940> hear<00:02:28.180> them<00:02:28.330> like

00:02:28.559 --> 00:02:28.569 
they need to maybe when i hear them like

00:02:28.569 --> 00:02:30.839 
they need to maybe when i hear them like
link<00:02:28.840> with<00:02:28.930> a<00:02:29.020> player<00:02:29.260> like<00:02:29.340> demaria<00:02:30.340> i<00:02:30.580> can

00:02:30.839 --> 00:02:30.849 
link with a player like demaria i can

00:02:30.849 --> 00:02:32.430 
link with a player like demaria i can
understand<00:02:31.239> why<00:02:31.420> they<00:02:31.630> are<00:02:31.810> because<00:02:32.019> I<00:02:32.290> say

00:02:32.430 --> 00:02:32.440 
understand why they are because I say

00:02:32.440 --> 00:02:35.729 
understand why they are because I say
Santi<00:02:33.280> Cazorla<00:02:33.400> gets<00:02:33.880> injured<00:02:34.360> I<00:02:34.599> don't<00:02:35.590> know

00:02:35.729 --> 00:02:35.739 
Santi Cazorla gets injured I don't know

00:02:35.739 --> 00:02:37.259 
Santi Cazorla gets injured I don't know
who's<00:02:35.950> going<00:02:36.069> to<00:02:36.160> give<00:02:36.370> them<00:02:36.459> that<00:02:36.670> you<00:02:37.239> know

00:02:37.259 --> 00:02:37.269 
who's going to give them that you know

00:02:37.269 --> 00:02:39.930 
who's going to give them that you know
that<00:02:37.450> that<00:02:37.810> final<00:02:38.260> pass<00:02:38.470> that's<00:02:38.920> a<00:02:39.190> you<00:02:39.790> know<00:02:39.910> a

00:02:39.930 --> 00:02:39.940 
that that final pass that's a you know a

00:02:39.940 --> 00:02:42.089 
that that final pass that's a you know a
bit<00:02:40.120> of<00:02:40.150> flare<00:02:40.480> in<00:02:40.750> midfield<00:02:40.930> so<00:02:41.830> I<00:02:41.860> think<00:02:42.040> they

00:02:42.089 --> 00:02:42.099 
bit of flare in midfield so I think they

00:02:42.099 --> 00:02:43.350 
bit of flare in midfield so I think they
do<00:02:42.220> need<00:02:42.340> to<00:02:42.400> go<00:02:42.550> strengthening<00:02:43.030> and<00:02:43.120> like<00:02:43.239> I

00:02:43.350 --> 00:02:43.360 
do need to go strengthening and like I

00:02:43.360 --> 00:02:44.970 
do need to go strengthening and like I
said<00:02:43.480> I<00:02:43.569> would<00:02:43.720> be<00:02:43.840> very<00:02:43.870> very<00:02:44.140> surprised<00:02:44.680> if

00:02:44.970 --> 00:02:44.980 
said I would be very very surprised if

00:02:44.980 --> 00:02:48.390 
said I would be very very surprised if
they<00:02:45.190> don't<00:02:45.519> make<00:02:45.970> them<00:02:46.980> Flamini's<00:02:47.980> left<00:02:48.220> AC

00:02:48.390 --> 00:02:48.400 
they don't make them Flamini's left AC

00:02:48.400 --> 00:02:49.949 
they don't make them Flamini's left AC

more strength in depth and they do need

to go and get Julio Cesar from QPR

00:02:57.819 --> 00:03:01.830 
to go and get Julio Cesar from QPR
because<00:02:58.299> in<00:02:58.930> my<00:02:59.110> opinion<00:02:59.459> Chesney<00:03:00.599> he's<00:03:01.599> not

because in my opinion Chesney he's not

00:03:01.840 --> 00:03:03.630 
because in my opinion Chesney he's not
good<00:03:02.049> enough<00:03:02.080> I<00:03:02.410> don't<00:03:02.860> write<00:03:03.040> him<00:03:03.190> at<00:03:03.340> all<00:03:03.519> I

00:03:03.630 --> 00:03:03.640 
good enough I don't write him at all I

00:03:03.640 --> 00:03:05.460 
good enough I don't write him at all I

00:03:05.460 --> 00:03:05.470 
think he's a very own enough very

00:03:05.470 --> 00:03:07.589 
think he's a very own enough very
inconsistent<00:03:06.250> since<00:03:06.819> I<00:03:06.940> think<00:03:07.180> that<00:03:07.299> he's<00:03:07.480> the

00:03:07.599 --> 00:03:09.990 
inconsistent since I think that he's the
sort<00:03:07.780> of<00:03:07.840> player<00:03:08.500> like<00:03:09.040> Raina<00:03:09.489> was<00:03:09.760> last

00:03:09.990 --> 00:03:10.000 
sort of player like Raina was last

00:03:10.000 --> 00:03:11.670 
sort of player like Raina was last
season<00:03:10.239> at<00:03:10.420> Newport<00:03:10.750> you<00:03:10.870> will<00:03:11.110> make<00:03:11.560> mistakes

00:03:11.670 --> 00:03:11.680 
season at Newport you will make mistakes

00:03:11.680 --> 00:03:14.670

in<00:03:12.160> cost<00:03:12.400> you<00:03:12.580> points<00:03:12.849> so<00:03:13.630> I<00:03:13.959> don't<00:03:14.200> understand

00:03:14.670 --> 00:03:14.680 
in cost you points so I don't understand

00:03:14.680 --> 00:03:17.520 
in cost you points so I don't understand
why<00:03:14.739> you<00:03:14.890> wouldn't<00:03:15.370> go<00:03:15.549> and<00:03:15.700> pick<00:03:15.849> up<00:03:16.170> say<00:03:17.170> czar

00:03:17.520 --> 00:03:17.530 
why you wouldn't go and pick up say czar

00:03:17.530 --> 00:03:20.910 
why you wouldn't go and pick up say czar
who<00:03:17.560> is<00:03:18.040> a<00:03:18.280> world-class<00:03:19.140> goalkeeper<00:03:20.140> I<00:03:20.320> don't

00:03:20.910 --> 00:03:20.920 
who is a world-class goalkeeper I don't

00:03:20.920 --> 00:03:22.050 
who is a world-class goalkeeper I don't
understand<00:03:21.310> why<00:03:21.370> they<00:03:21.489> won't<00:03:21.609> go<00:03:21.760> and<00:03:21.880> get<00:03:21.940> him

00:03:22.050 --> 00:03:22.060 
understand why they won't go and get him

00:03:22.060 --> 00:03:24.270 
understand why they won't go and get him
so<00:03:22.329> that's<00:03:22.989> my<00:03:23.170> thoughts<00:03:23.470> on<00:03:23.680> today's<00:03:23.829> game

00:03:24.270 --> 00:03:24.280 
so that's my thoughts on today's game

00:03:24.280 --> 00:03:26.640 
so that's my thoughts on today's game
another<00:03:24.910> good<00:03:25.359> points<00:03:25.720> by<00:03:25.840> Kieran<00:03:26.140> Gibbs<00:03:26.350> I

00:03:26.640 --> 00:03:26.650 
another good points by Kieran Gibbs I

00:03:26.650 --> 00:03:28.680 
another good points by Kieran Gibbs I
think<00:03:26.859> he<00:03:26.980> looks<00:03:27.549> a<00:03:27.730> really<00:03:28.180> good<00:03:28.329> player<00:03:28.540> and

00:03:28.680 --> 00:03:28.690 
think he looks a really good player and

00:03:28.690 --> 00:03:30.930 
think he looks a really good player and
he's<00:03:28.810> keeping<00:03:28.930> a<00:03:29.170> memory<00:03:29.829> are<00:03:29.950> at<00:03:30.220> left-back

00:03:30.930 --> 00:03:30.940 
he's keeping a memory are at left-back

00:03:30.940 --> 00:03:33.479 
he's keeping a memory are at left-back
so<00:03:31.329> that'd<00:03:31.840> be<00:03:31.930> good<00:03:32.049> to<00:03:32.170> see<00:03:32.350> it's<00:03:32.739> also<00:03:32.950> also

00:03:33.479 --> 00:03:33.489 
so that'd be good to see it's also also

00:03:33.489 --> 00:03:35.309 
so that'd be good to see it's also also
one<00:03:34.209> thing<00:03:34.359> I'm<00:03:34.450> kind<00:03:34.720> of<00:03:34.810> interested<00:03:34.989> I

00:03:35.309 --> 00:03:35.319

opinion<00:03:36.910> I<00:03:37.420> think<00:03:37.810> he's<00:03:38.019> betting<00:03:38.260> a<00:03:38.350> sonia<00:03:38.590> on

00:03:39.360 --> 00:03:39.370
