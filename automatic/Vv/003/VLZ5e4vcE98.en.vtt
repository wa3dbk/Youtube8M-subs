00:00:12.720 --> 00:00:16.109 

okay<00:00:13.720> so<00:00:13.780> I'm<00:00:14.350> starting<00:00:14.740> with<00:00:15.130> an<00:00:15.460> old<00:00:15.760> twist

00:00:16.109 --> 00:00:16.119 
okay so I'm starting with an old twist

00:00:16.119 --> 00:00:18.000 
okay so I'm starting with an old twist
out<00:00:16.390> I<00:00:16.810> just<00:00:17.170> kind<00:00:17.320> of<00:00:17.410> picked<00:00:17.650> it<00:00:17.770> out<00:00:17.830> and

00:00:18.000 --> 00:00:18.010 
out I just kind of picked it out and

00:00:18.010 --> 00:00:19.019 
out I just kind of picked it out and
pulled<00:00:18.190> it<00:00:18.279> out<00:00:18.400> so<00:00:18.610> it's<00:00:18.730> a<00:00:18.790> little<00:00:18.910> bit

00:00:19.019 --> 00:00:19.029 
pulled it out so it's a little bit

00:00:19.029 --> 00:00:21.750 
pulled it out so it's a little bit
stretched<00:00:19.480> and<00:00:19.840> it<00:00:20.349> is<00:00:20.500> easier<00:00:21.220> to<00:00:21.279> start<00:00:21.550> with

00:00:21.750 --> 00:00:21.760 
stretched and it is easier to start with

00:00:21.760 --> 00:00:23.460 
stretched and it is easier to start with
hair<00:00:22.420> that's<00:00:22.660> a<00:00:22.689> little<00:00:22.869> bit<00:00:22.990> more<00:00:23.140> stretched

00:00:23.460 --> 00:00:23.470 
hair that's a little bit more stretched

00:00:23.470 --> 00:00:26.999 
hair that's a little bit more stretched
because<00:00:23.770> it's<00:00:24.160> easier<00:00:24.490> to<00:00:24.580> pull<00:00:24.790> up<00:00:25.050> so<00:00:26.050> first

00:00:26.999 --> 00:00:27.009 
because it's easier to pull up so first

00:04:08.880 --> 00:04:08.890 
I ended up with a bowel five twist on

00:04:08.890 --> 00:04:11.160 
I ended up with a bowel five twist on
this<00:04:09.159> Bank<00:04:09.430> p<00:04:09.640> so<00:04:10.239> what<00:04:10.420> I'm<00:04:10.480> going<00:04:10.599> to<00:04:10.659> do<00:04:10.900> with

this Bank p so what I'm going to do with
these<00:04:11.379> I'm<00:04:11.830> going<00:04:12.040> to<00:04:12.129> pin<00:04:12.819> them<00:04:13.000> in<00:04:13.180> a<00:04:13.420> circle

00:04:13.890 --> 00:04:13.900 
these I'm going to pin them in a circle

00:04:13.900 --> 00:04:16.409 
these I'm going to pin them in a circle
so<00:04:14.200> they<00:04:14.349> look<00:04:14.530> like<00:04:14.680> loops<00:04:15.090> it<00:04:16.090> look<00:04:16.239> like<00:04:16.389> a

00:04:16.409 --> 00:04:16.419

00:04:42.619 --> 00:04:42.629 
down and I'm going to pin it at the base

00:04:42.629 --> 00:04:46.469 
down and I'm going to pin it at the base
right<00:04:43.629> here<00:04:44.819> okay<00:04:45.819> and<00:04:45.849> then<00:04:46.180> I'm<00:04:46.300> going<00:04:46.419> to

right here okay and then I'm going to
also<00:04:46.659> pin<00:04:46.960> it<00:04:47.080> at<00:04:47.199> the<00:04:47.289> end<00:04:47.470> so<00:04:47.830> that<00:04:48.009> that<00:04:48.580> end

00:04:48.899 --> 00:04:48.909 
also pin it at the end so that that end

00:04:48.909 --> 00:04:54.450 
also pin it at the end so that that end
stays<00:04:49.270> in<00:04:49.509> there<00:04:52.710> I'm<00:04:53.710> going<00:04:53.860> to<00:04:53.919> pin<00:04:54.099> the<00:04:54.250> in

00:04:54.450 --> 00:04:54.460 
stays in there I'm going to pin the in

00:04:54.460 --> 00:04:57.649 
stays in there I'm going to pin the in
into<00:04:54.909> the<00:04:55.060> base<00:04:55.210> and<00:04:55.900> push<00:04:56.169> the<00:04:56.379> pin<00:04:56.590> in<00:04:56.740> there

00:04:57.649 --> 00:04:57.659 
into the base and push the pin in there

00:04:57.659 --> 00:05:03.029 
into the base and push the pin in there
ok<00:04:58.860> so<00:04:59.860> that's<00:05:00.039> like<00:05:00.220> that<00:05:01.409> and<00:05:02.409> then<00:05:02.800> I<00:05:02.889> want

00:05:08.949 --> 00:05:11.459 
overlapping that first one and I'm going
to<00:05:09.009> push<00:05:09.219> the<00:05:09.520> in<00:05:09.789> into<00:05:10.389> the<00:05:10.479> base<00:05:10.690> and<00:05:11.289> I'm

00:05:11.459 --> 00:05:11.469 
to push the in into the base and I'm

00:05:11.469 --> 00:05:15.300 
to push the in into the base and I'm
going<00:05:11.620> to<00:05:11.680> pin<00:05:11.860> that<00:05:12.120> right<00:05:13.120> there<00:05:13.530> ok<00:05:14.530> and

00:05:15.300 --> 00:05:15.310 
going to pin that right there ok and

going to pin that right there ok and
then<00:05:15.370> I<00:05:16.180> might<00:05:16.870> actually<00:05:17.020> put<00:05:17.440> another<00:05:17.680> pin<00:05:17.949> on

00:05:18.089 --> 00:05:18.099 
then I might actually put another pin on

00:05:18.099 --> 00:05:19.499 
then I might actually put another pin on
the<00:05:18.129> base<00:05:18.400> too<00:05:18.610> because<00:05:18.819> I<00:05:18.909> want<00:05:19.090> it<00:05:19.180> to<00:05:19.210> lay<00:05:19.479> a
