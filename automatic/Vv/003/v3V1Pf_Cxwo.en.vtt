not<00:01:09.990> working<00:01:10.350> because<00:01:10.920> I've<00:01:11.220> already<00:01:11.400> done<00:01:11.880> it

00:01:12.230 --> 00:01:12.240 
not working because I've already done it

00:01:12.240 --> 00:01:14.810 
not working because I've already done it
previous<00:01:13.020> and<00:01:13.170> it<00:01:13.260> made<00:01:13.439> a<00:01:13.470> mule<00:01:13.799> which<00:01:14.640> is

00:01:14.810 --> 00:01:14.820 
previous and it made a mule which is

00:01:14.820 --> 00:01:17.330 
previous and it made a mule which is
there<00:01:15.030> a<00:01:15.060> baby<00:01:15.330> mule<00:01:15.720> you<00:01:16.380> basically<00:01:16.710> to<00:01:17.009> a

00:01:17.330 --> 00:01:17.340 
there a baby mule you basically to a

00:01:17.340 --> 00:01:19.580 
there a baby mule you basically to a
horse<00:01:17.759> and<00:01:18.030> a<00:01:18.210> mute<00:01:18.450> a<00:01:18.570> horse<00:01:18.869> and<00:01:19.049> a<00:01:19.110> donkey

horse and a mute a horse and a donkey
that's<00:01:20.310> probably<00:01:20.460> why<00:01:21.049> no<00:01:22.049> because<00:01:22.560> he's

00:01:22.700 --> 00:01:22.710 
that's probably why no because he's

00:01:22.710 --> 00:01:24.499 
that's probably why no because he's
already<00:01:22.920> been<00:01:23.250> made<00:01:23.640> and<00:01:24.060> I<00:01:24.119> can't<00:01:24.360> do<00:01:24.479> that

00:01:26.899 --> 00:01:26.909 
once he needs to be timed you need a

00:01:26.909 --> 00:01:29.480 
once he needs to be timed you need a
