00:01:59.230 --> 00:01:59.240 
of crushes amia it's effective but when

00:01:59.240 --> 00:02:01.060 
of crushes amia it's effective but when
that<00:01:59.390> we<00:01:59.570> took<00:01:59.690> diet<00:01:59.990> samples<00:02:00.500> you<00:02:00.890> know<00:02:00.950> we

00:02:01.060 --> 00:02:01.070 
that we took diet samples you know we

00:02:01.070 --> 00:02:03.310 
that we took diet samples you know we
collected<00:02:01.430> the<00:02:01.490> stomach's<00:02:01.910> we<00:02:02.060> sex<00:02:02.960> the<00:02:03.140> fish

00:02:03.310 --> 00:02:03.320 
collected the stomach's we sex the fish

00:02:03.320 --> 00:02:05.170 
collected the stomach's we sex the fish
we<00:02:03.560> determine<00:02:04.160> males<00:02:04.370> or<00:02:04.550> females<00:02:04.580> if<00:02:05.060> they

00:02:05.170 --> 00:02:05.180 
we determine males or females if they

00:02:05.180 --> 00:02:07.780 
we determine males or females if they
had<00:02:05.270> spawned<00:02:05.540> yet<00:02:05.810> mmm<00:02:06.260> we<00:02:06.500> take<00:02:06.710> scales<00:02:07.430> and

00:02:07.780 --> 00:02:07.790 
had spawned yet mmm we take scales and

00:02:07.790 --> 00:02:09.190 
had spawned yet mmm we take scales and
fly<00:02:08.119> through<00:02:08.269> which<00:02:08.479> is<00:02:08.629> part<00:02:08.840> of<00:02:08.869> their<00:02:09.019> per

00:02:09.190 --> 00:02:09.200 
fly through which is part of their per

00:02:09.200 --> 00:02:10.900 
fly through which is part of their per
coulomb<00:02:09.470> which<00:02:10.039> is<00:02:10.160> a<00:02:10.190> bone<00:02:10.399> that<00:02:10.550> we<00:02:10.610> can<00:02:10.759> age

00:02:10.900 --> 00:02:10.910 
coulomb which is a bone that we can age

00:02:10.910 --> 00:02:12.670 
coulomb which is a bone that we can age
the<00:02:11.090> fish<00:02:11.269> from<00:02:11.510> and<00:02:11.750> and<00:02:12.019> that's<00:02:12.200> in<00:02:12.319> the<00:02:12.440> jaw

00:02:12.670 --> 00:02:12.680 
the fish from and and that's in the jaw

00:02:12.680 --> 00:02:14.800 
the fish from and and that's in the jaw
bone<00:02:12.710> of<00:02:13.100> the<00:02:13.160> fish<00:02:13.370> yeah<00:02:13.700> in<00:02:13.940> the<00:02:14.120> in<00:02:14.450> the<00:02:14.480> per

00:02:14.800 --> 00:02:14.810 
bone of the fish yeah in the in the per

00:02:14.810 --> 00:02:15.730 
bone of the fish yeah in the in the per
coulomb

00:02:15.730 --> 00:02:15.740 
coulomb

00:02:15.740 --> 00:02:18.310 
coulomb
is<00:02:15.830> that<00:02:16.010> guilt<00:02:16.550> cover<00:02:16.820> okay<00:02:17.480> the<00:02:17.600> cover<00:02:17.840> okay

00:02:18.310 --> 00:02:18.320 
is that guilt cover okay the cover okay

00:02:18.320 --> 00:02:20.170 
is that guilt cover okay the cover okay
so<00:02:18.800> it's<00:02:19.010> a<00:02:19.070> piece<00:02:19.250> of<00:02:19.280> that<00:02:19.430> bounine<00:02:19.970> and

00:02:20.170 --> 00:02:20.180 
so it's a piece of that bounine and

00:02:20.180 --> 00:02:22.090 
so it's a piece of that bounine and
those<00:02:20.780> bony<00:02:21.020> structures<00:02:21.500> you<00:02:21.590> can<00:02:21.680> age<00:02:21.860> the

00:02:22.090 --> 00:02:22.100 
those bony structures you can age the

00:02:22.100 --> 00:02:24.400 
those bony structures you can age the
fish<00:02:22.280> and<00:02:22.430> so<00:02:22.580> we<00:02:22.670> can<00:02:22.820> look<00:02:22.940> at<00:02:23.060> the<00:02:23.630> eight<00:02:23.960> age

00:02:24.400 --> 00:02:24.410 
fish and so we can look at the eight age

00:02:24.410 --> 00:02:26.710 
fish and so we can look at the eight age
ranges<00:02:24.860> within<00:02:25.040> the<00:02:25.250> population<00:02:25.400> and<00:02:26.090> that

00:02:26.710 --> 00:02:26.720 
ranges within the population and that

00:02:26.720 --> 00:02:27.820 
ranges within the population and that
gives<00:02:26.870> us<00:02:26.960> good<00:02:27.140> idea<00:02:27.380> of<00:02:27.440> what<00:02:27.560> the<00:02:27.650> growth

00:02:27.820 --> 00:02:27.830 
gives us good idea of what the growth

00:02:27.830 --> 00:02:30.460 
gives us good idea of what the growth
rates<00:02:28.070> are<00:02:28.220> for<00:02:28.400> the<00:02:28.460> population<00:02:29.150> okay<00:02:29.900> just<00:02:30.290> a

00:02:30.460 --> 00:02:30.470 
rates are for the population okay just a

00:02:30.470 --> 00:02:31.990 
rates are for the population okay just a
lot<00:02:30.620> of<00:02:30.650> information<00:02:31.280> from<00:02:31.460> that<00:02:31.640> one<00:02:31.820> week

00:02:31.990 --> 00:02:32.000 
lot of information from that one week

00:02:51.830 --> 00:02:53.860 
there netting all the pikey cannon and
that's<00:02:52.040> not<00:02:52.280> it<00:02:52.460> at<00:02:52.490> all<00:02:52.700> just<00:02:53.090> taking<00:02:53.780> a

00:02:53.860 --> 00:02:53.870 
that's not it at all just taking a

00:02:53.870 --> 00:02:55.990 
that's not it at all just taking a
standard<00:02:54.260> sample<00:02:54.470> yeah<00:02:55.100> it's<00:02:55.340> statistically

00:02:55.990 --> 00:02:56.000 
standard sample yeah it's statistically

00:02:56.000 --> 00:02:58.090 
standard sample yeah it's statistically
valid<00:02:56.240> you<00:02:56.750> can<00:02:56.930> compare<00:02:57.470> that<00:02:57.680> from<00:02:57.950> your

00:02:58.090 --> 00:02:58.100 
valid you can compare that from your

00:02:58.100 --> 00:03:01.030 
valid you can compare that from your
year<00:02:58.520> to<00:02:59.330> monitor<00:02:59.900> trends<00:03:00.140> in<00:03:00.410> abundance<00:03:00.860> and

00:03:01.030 --> 00:03:01.040 
year to monitor trends in abundance and

00:03:01.040 --> 00:03:02.920 
year to monitor trends in abundance and
we'll<00:03:01.220> watch<00:03:01.550> that<00:03:01.820> puck<00:03:02.000> so<00:03:02.210> you're<00:03:02.450> a<00:03:02.480> sample

00:03:02.920 --> 00:03:02.930 
we'll watch that puck so you're a sample

00:03:02.930 --> 00:03:04.060 
we'll watch that puck so you're a sample
every<00:03:03.080> year<00:03:03.260> or<00:03:03.350> every<00:03:03.380> third<00:03:03.710> year<00:03:03.770> or

00:03:04.060 --> 00:03:04.070 
every year or every third year or

00:03:04.070 --> 00:03:05.650 
every year or every third year or
something<00:03:04.220> yeah<00:03:04.670> we'll<00:03:05.240> look<00:03:05.360> at<00:03:05.480> the<00:03:05.570> day

00:03:05.650 --> 00:03:05.660 
something yeah we'll look at the day

00:03:05.660 --> 00:03:07.030 
something yeah we'll look at the day
that<00:03:05.810> we<00:03:05.930> got<00:03:05.960> this<00:03:06.230> year<00:03:06.470> and<00:03:06.590> set<00:03:06.740> up<00:03:06.890> a

00:03:07.030 --> 00:03:07.040 
that we got this year and set up a

00:03:07.040 --> 00:03:08.620 
that we got this year and set up a
sampling<00:03:07.700> plan<00:03:07.910> for<00:03:08.120> the<00:03:08.180> future<00:03:08.330> whether

00:03:08.620 --> 00:03:08.630 
sampling plan for the future whether

00:03:08.630 --> 00:03:10.900 
sampling plan for the future whether
that's<00:03:08.870> every<00:03:09.440> year<00:03:09.650> or<00:03:10.070> every<00:03:10.160> other<00:03:10.430> year<00:03:10.790> or

00:03:10.900 --> 00:03:10.910 
that's every year or every other year or

00:03:10.910 --> 00:03:12.520 
that's every year or every other year or
something<00:03:11.030> like<00:03:11.360> that<00:03:11.420> okay<00:03:12.050> then<00:03:12.410> your

00:03:12.520 --> 00:03:12.530 
something like that okay then your

00:03:12.530 --> 00:03:14.770 
something like that okay then your
future<00:03:12.920> we<00:03:13.520> do<00:03:13.640> a<00:03:13.670> similar<00:03:13.940> survey<00:03:14.450> in<00:03:14.720> the

00:03:14.770 --> 00:03:14.780 
future we do a similar survey in the

00:03:14.780 --> 00:03:16.780 
future we do a similar survey in the
fall<00:03:15.200> for<00:03:15.500> our<00:03:15.590> wall<00:03:15.770> light<00:03:15.920> populations<00:03:16.580> on

00:03:16.780 --> 00:03:16.790 
fall for our wall light populations on

00:03:16.790 --> 00:03:19.060 
fall for our wall light populations on
our<00:03:17.330> big<00:03:17.600> populations<00:03:18.230> like<00:03:18.410> Lake<00:03:18.860> Roosevelt

00:03:19.060 --> 00:03:19.070 
our big populations like Lake Roosevelt

00:03:19.070 --> 00:03:21.490 
our big populations like Lake Roosevelt
ok<00:03:19.940> and<00:03:20.480> then<00:03:20.660> also<00:03:20.840> potholes<00:03:21.350> reservoir

00:03:21.490 --> 00:03:21.500 
ok and then also potholes reservoir

00:03:21.500 --> 00:03:24.190 
ok and then also potholes reservoir
Moses<00:03:22.400> Lake<00:03:22.580> banks<00:03:22.910> lake<00:03:23.060> and<00:03:23.390> we<00:03:23.900> do<00:03:24.020> those

00:03:24.190 --> 00:03:24.200 
Moses Lake banks lake and we do those

00:03:24.200 --> 00:03:26.470 
Moses Lake banks lake and we do those
each<00:03:24.380> year<00:03:24.590> in<00:03:24.650> the<00:03:24.710> fall<00:03:24.920> and<00:03:24.980> and<00:03:25.480> those

00:03:26.470 --> 00:03:26.480 
each year in the fall and and those

00:03:26.480 --> 00:03:29.110 
each year in the fall and and those
typically<00:03:26.930> we<00:03:27.140> catch<00:03:27.320> 200<00:03:28.070> to<00:03:28.220> 300<00:03:28.640> walleye<00:03:28.880> in

00:03:29.110 --> 00:03:29.120 
typically we catch 200 to 300 walleye in

00:03:29.120 --> 00:03:31.090 
typically we catch 200 to 300 walleye in
a<00:03:29.210> sample<00:03:29.630> mmm<00:03:30.080> that<00:03:30.440> just<00:03:30.620> gives<00:03:30.740> us<00:03:30.950> that

00:03:31.090 --> 00:03:31.100 
a sample mmm that just gives us that

00:03:31.100 --> 00:03:33.310 
a sample mmm that just gives us that
snapshot<00:03:31.490> for<00:03:31.970> the<00:03:32.090> year<00:03:32.270> and<00:03:32.510> can<00:03:32.930> compare

00:03:33.310 --> 00:03:33.320 
snapshot for the year and can compare

00:03:33.320 --> 00:03:35.760 
snapshot for the year and can compare
your<00:03:33.530> near<00:03:33.890> know<00:03:34.220> we<00:03:34.340> found<00:03:34.610> that<00:03:34.790> having<00:03:35.570> that

your near know we found that having that
date<00:03:36.770> a<00:03:36.800> year<00:03:37.160> to<00:03:37.310> year<00:03:37.520> you<00:03:37.910> really<00:03:38.150> learn<00:03:38.300> a

00:03:38.320 --> 00:03:38.330 
date a year to year you really learn a

00:03:38.330 --> 00:03:40.690 
date a year to year you really learn a
lot<00:03:38.450> more<00:03:38.630> about<00:03:39.020> the<00:03:39.140> population<00:03:39.800> and<00:03:40.160> in<00:03:40.610> the

00:03:40.690 --> 00:03:40.700 
lot more about the population and in the

00:03:40.700 --> 00:03:42.040 
lot more about the population and in the
case<00:03:40.880> of<00:03:40.910> wall<00:03:41.210> light<00:03:41.420> we've<00:03:41.570> been<00:03:41.780> able<00:03:41.900> to

00:03:42.040 --> 00:03:42.050 
case of wall light we've been able to

00:03:42.050 --> 00:03:44.560 
case of wall light we've been able to
relax<00:03:42.380> our<00:03:42.650> rags<00:03:42.920> where<00:03:43.700> which<00:03:44.090> allows<00:03:44.360> more

00:03:44.560 --> 00:03:44.570 
relax our rags where which allows more

00:03:44.570 --> 00:03:46.860 
relax our rags where which allows more
harvest<00:03:45.050> for<00:03:45.200> people<00:03:45.560> without<00:03:45.650> the
