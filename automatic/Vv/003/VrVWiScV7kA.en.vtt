00:00:12.990 --> 00:00:17.789
 hello and welcome my name is eva 

00:00:15.180 --> 00:00:19.860
 from ron thiessen how know are curved 

00:00:17.789 --> 00:00:21.660
 displays currently totally in trend 

00:00:19.860 --> 00:00:23.279
 That's why we want you this samsung 

00:00:21.660 --> 00:00:27.570
 monitor not withheld 

00:00:23.279 --> 00:00:31.140
 the s 34 7 190 c owns like a name 

00:00:27.570 --> 00:00:33.809
 already says a 34 inch display one 

00:00:31.140 --> 00:00:36.000
 curved and now first in 

00:00:33.809 --> 00:00:38.160
 outward appearances how to easily 

00:00:36.000 --> 00:00:38.699
 can recognize the aspect ratio 21 too 

00:00:38.160 --> 00:00:40.710
 9 

00:00:38.699 --> 00:00:43.410
 Overall, the design is rather simple 

00:00:40.710 --> 00:00:45.720
 kept the monitor relatively narrow 

00:00:43.410 --> 00:00:47.190
 side margins in a glossy black 

00:00:45.720 --> 00:00:48.720
 own surface 

00:00:47.190 --> 00:00:51.150
 unfortunately you can see it relatively fast 

00:00:48.720 --> 00:00:53.159
 the fingerprints otherwise pretty nice 

00:00:51.150 --> 00:00:56.309
 From the outside is that the edge 

00:00:53.159 --> 00:00:59.580
 made of metals and very dark invite 

00:00:56.309 --> 00:01:01.650
 The monitor can be attached to both 

00:00:59.580 --> 00:01:03.269
 simply attach the wall directly or 

00:01:01.650 --> 00:01:05.100
 you let him stand on the stand 

00:01:03.269 --> 00:01:07.380
 the stand is similar to the 

00:01:05.100 --> 00:01:09.590
 monitor or the same be strong 

00:01:07.380 --> 00:01:12.299
 held and has a wife 

00:01:09.590 --> 00:01:14.159
 plastic surface so that only becomes 

00:01:12.299 --> 00:01:16.350
 not only us but also her 

00:01:14.159 --> 00:01:17.850
 Monitor can adjust correctly that he 

00:01:16.350 --> 00:01:19.259
 Just go up and down 

00:01:17.850 --> 00:01:21.030
 Adjust and also the angle of inclination 

00:01:19.259 --> 00:01:22.640
 can be totally seated 

00:01:21.030 --> 00:01:24.539
 align 

00:01:22.640 --> 00:01:25.710
 before you get the technical details 

00:01:24.539 --> 00:01:27.929
 proceeds would still like the 

00:01:25.710 --> 00:01:29.670
 back side on the right side 

00:01:27.929 --> 00:01:31.530
 is the power button 

00:01:29.670 --> 00:01:33.149
 The service immediately shows as a controller 

00:01:31.530 --> 00:01:35.100
 and to select different modes 

00:01:33.149 --> 00:01:38.490
 here on the left are various 

00:01:35.100 --> 00:01:42.770
 interfaces have a lot of power hdmi 1.2 

00:01:38.490 --> 00:01:45.030
 the displayport and another four usb 3.0 

00:01:42.770 --> 00:01:46.079
 Connections for different devices 

00:01:45.030 --> 00:01:49.560
 can connect 

00:01:46.079 --> 00:01:51.390
 Also, there is only one audio output in the 

00:01:49.560 --> 00:01:52.799
 training you can already notice that 

00:01:51.390 --> 00:01:55.590
 you monitor a bit shaky 

00:01:52.799 --> 00:01:59.069
 vulnerable one pushes him back and forth 

00:01:55.590 --> 00:02:01.920
 moves the display but significantly 

00:01:59.069 --> 00:02:03.829
 even though he is 74 kilograms away with 

00:02:01.920 --> 00:02:06.030
 Stand even 99 kilo 

00:02:03.829 --> 00:02:07.829
 we come to what the monitor 

00:02:06.030 --> 00:02:11.700
 distinguishes his screen 

00:02:07.829 --> 00:02:14.100
 the monitor a va panel what is in 

00:02:11.700 --> 00:02:16.200
 different perspectives on the 

00:02:14.100 --> 00:02:19.410
 TN panel demarcates and benefits 

00:02:16.200 --> 00:02:22.410
 affects image contrast because it meant 

00:02:19.410 --> 00:02:25.190
 Monitor is the 3000 to 1 of the 

00:02:22.410 --> 00:02:27.170
 another is the angle at panel 

00:02:25.190 --> 00:02:30.040
 extremely high here in the 

00:02:27.170 --> 00:02:31.430
 horizontal 178 degrees in the vertical 

00:02:30.040 --> 00:02:35.170
 178 degrees 

00:02:31.430 --> 00:02:37.250
 a disadvantage of vp panels are the 

00:02:35.170 --> 00:02:39.590
 reaction speeds but that are 

00:02:37.250 --> 00:02:41.390
 here with four milliseconds of gray too 

00:02:39.590 --> 00:02:43.490
 gray really okay 

00:02:41.390 --> 00:02:45.410
 a monitor will be especially enjoyable 

00:02:43.490 --> 00:02:48.320
 if you look good on it 

00:02:45.410 --> 00:02:50.540
 For example, you can watch videos 

00:02:48.320 --> 00:02:52.220
 dissolved or games would be so lust 

00:02:50.540 --> 00:02:53.630
 on gambling we have this monitor 

00:02:52.220 --> 00:02:56.870
 just as bad lifted 

00:02:53.630 --> 00:02:59.720
 it solves in three 1440 x 1440 

00:02:56.870 --> 00:03:01.850
 pixel on apropos gaming is however 

00:02:59.720 --> 00:03:04.340
 a gaming mode lisa causes the 

00:03:01.850 --> 00:03:05.840
 brightness contrast can be raised 

00:03:04.340 --> 00:03:07.250
 especially useful if you have the opponent 

00:03:05.840 --> 00:03:08.510
 or an obstacle a bit earlier 

00:03:07.250 --> 00:03:10.850
 as the others want to recognize 

00:03:08.510 --> 00:03:13.340
 two additional modes are included 

00:03:10.850 --> 00:03:15.440
 picture and picture in picture picture 

00:03:13.340 --> 00:03:16.970
 in picture I used today and 

00:03:15.440 --> 00:03:19.280
 both my notebook and mine 

00:03:16.970 --> 00:03:21.380
 desktop pc to him and he to join 

00:03:19.280 --> 00:03:23.180
 I could want something in hand 

00:03:21.380 --> 00:03:25.010
 annoying powerpoint presentation will 

00:03:23.180 --> 00:03:26.720
 one for the uni and then comes 

00:03:25.010 --> 00:03:27.980
 at the same time the new episode of game of 

00:03:26.720 --> 00:03:30.530
 we look at thrones 

00:03:27.980 --> 00:03:32.300
 the whole picture in picture 

00:03:30.530 --> 00:03:33.140
 so that I can do the two pictures namely 

00:03:32.300 --> 00:03:34.430
 scale 

00:03:33.140 --> 00:03:36.530
 the longer the evening is 

00:03:34.430 --> 00:03:37.940
 progresses the more interested 

00:03:36.530 --> 00:03:38.780
 me game of thrones and so less 

00:03:37.940 --> 00:03:41.480
 I have interest for mine 

00:03:38.780 --> 00:03:43.430
 presentation game of thrones picture is growing 

00:03:41.480 --> 00:03:45.560
 and grows kall of her bigger and bigger 

00:03:43.430 --> 00:03:47.510
 depending on how it likes to move 

00:03:45.560 --> 00:03:49.220
 want to have and the presentations 

00:03:47.510 --> 00:03:51.800
 Backtrack slowly into the background 

00:03:49.220 --> 00:03:53.780
 The Samsung CLP Monitor is for around 

00:03:51.800 --> 00:03:56.300
 1300 euro recommended retail price 

00:03:53.780 --> 00:03:58.700
 Available in Germany if we still 

00:03:56.300 --> 00:04:00.170
 want to know more about the monitor 

00:03:58.700 --> 00:04:01.340
 just look below in the description 

00:04:00.170 --> 00:04:02.600
