00:01:58.649 --> 00:01:58.659 
to the other team even last year if we

00:01:58.659 --> 00:02:00.149

held<00:01:58.840> onto<00:01:59.020> the<00:01:59.259> ball<00:01:59.409> our<00:01:59.649> record<00:01:59.979> would<00:02:00.069> have

00:02:00.149 --> 00:02:00.159 
held onto the ball our record would have

00:02:00.159 --> 00:02:02.190

00:02:02.190 --> 00:02:02.200 
been a lot different so we're hoping

00:02:02.200 --> 00:02:03.660 
been a lot different so we're hoping
with<00:02:02.350> another<00:02:02.619> year<00:02:02.860> of<00:02:02.890> experience<00:02:03.039> we<00:02:03.520> got<00:02:03.640> a
