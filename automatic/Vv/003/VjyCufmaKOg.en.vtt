going to happen is Jupiter is going to

00:00:58.050 --> 00:01:03.740 
going to happen is Jupiter is going to
be<00:00:58.199> debilitated<00:00:59.039> and<00:01:01.760> usually<00:01:02.760> people<00:01:02.940> think

00:01:15.700 --> 00:01:15.710 
results and especially a benefit planet

00:01:15.710 --> 00:01:21.640 
results and especially a benefit planet
like<00:01:16.710> Jupiter<00:01:16.920> should<00:01:17.880> not<00:01:19.580> go<00:01:20.580> under

00:01:21.640 --> 00:01:21.650 
like Jupiter should not go under

00:01:21.650 --> 00:01:27.910 
like Jupiter should not go under
debilitation<00:01:24.049> it<00:01:25.049> is<00:01:25.259> to<00:01:25.530> some<00:01:25.680> extent<00:01:26.130> true

00:01:27.910 --> 00:01:27.920 
debilitation it is to some extent true

00:01:27.920 --> 00:01:33.289 
debilitation it is to some extent true
but<00:01:28.920> then<00:01:29.130> there<00:01:29.340> are<00:01:29.369> advantages<00:01:30.090> also<00:01:32.299> the

00:01:33.289 --> 00:01:33.299 
but then there are advantages also the

00:01:33.299 --> 00:01:35.480 
but then there are advantages also the
advantage<00:01:33.840> is<00:01:33.869> whenever<00:01:34.650> the<00:01:34.860> planet<00:01:35.310> is

00:01:35.480 --> 00:01:35.490 
advantage is whenever the planet is

00:01:35.490 --> 00:01:39.020 
advantage is whenever the planet is
debilitated<00:01:36.299> this<00:01:36.810> is<00:01:36.960> a<00:01:36.990> sick<00:01:37.409> reseda<00:01:38.070> as

00:01:39.020 --> 00:01:39.030 
debilitated this is a sick reseda as

going<00:02:06.150> to<00:02:06.600> happen<00:02:06.810> on<00:02:07.520> during<00:02:08.520> this<00:02:10.610> time<00:02:11.610> that

00:02:12.040 --> 00:02:12.050 
going to happen on during this time that

00:02:12.050 --> 00:02:16.190 
going to happen on during this time that
Jupiter<00:02:13.050> is<00:02:13.200> transiting<00:02:14.270> in<00:02:15.270> caprica<00:02:15.930> of

00:02:16.190 --> 00:02:16.200 
Jupiter is transiting in caprica of

00:02:16.200 --> 00:02:17.990 
Jupiter is transiting in caprica of
course<00:02:16.470> he<00:02:16.680> was<00:02:16.950> going<00:02:17.250> to<00:02:17.280> that<00:02:17.550> go<00:02:17.819> retro

00:02:17.990 --> 00:02:18.000 
course he was going to that go retro

00:02:18.000 --> 00:02:20.030 
course he was going to that go retro
grade<00:02:18.420> and<00:02:18.630> come<00:02:18.810> back<00:02:18.959> again<00:02:19.170> there<00:02:19.890> will<00:02:20.010> be

00:02:20.030 --> 00:02:20.040 
grade and come back again there will be

00:02:20.040 --> 00:02:23.720 
grade and come back again there will be
some<00:02:20.310> time<00:02:20.610> I<00:02:21.060> will<00:02:21.300> talk<00:02:22.170> about<00:02:22.350> it<00:02:22.730> whatever

00:02:23.720 --> 00:02:23.730 
some time I will talk about it whatever

00:02:23.730 --> 00:02:29.660 
some time I will talk about it whatever
you<00:02:23.970> becomes<00:02:24.390> retrograde<00:02:28.190> so<00:02:29.190> the<00:02:29.430> most

00:02:29.660 --> 00:02:29.670 
you becomes retrograde so the most

00:02:29.670 --> 00:02:31.880 
you becomes retrograde so the most
important<00:02:30.180> thing<00:02:30.360> is<00:02:30.540> take<00:02:30.930> advantage<00:02:31.650> of

00:02:31.880 --> 00:02:31.890 
important thing is take advantage of

00:02:31.890 --> 00:02:36.699 
important thing is take advantage of
this<00:02:32.220> time<00:02:32.610> of<00:02:32.970> great<00:02:33.840> learning<00:02:34.790> and<00:02:35.790> it<00:02:35.940> is

00:02:36.699 --> 00:02:36.709 
this time of great learning and it is

00:02:36.709 --> 00:02:41.630 
this time of great learning and it is
time<00:02:37.709> to<00:02:37.739> make<00:02:38.340> a<00:02:38.370> pilgrimage<00:02:38.670> to<00:02:39.540> India<00:02:40.640> there

00:02:41.630 --> 00:02:41.640 
time to make a pilgrimage to India there

00:02:41.640 --> 00:02:45.170 
time to make a pilgrimage to India there
are<00:02:41.670> so<00:02:42.209> many<00:02:42.750> places<00:02:43.170> where<00:02:43.800> you<00:02:44.100> can<00:02:44.400> get<00:02:44.670> the

00:02:45.170 --> 00:02:45.180 
are so many places where you can get the

00:02:45.180 --> 00:02:50.330 
are so many places where you can get the
energy<00:02:45.720> of<00:02:46.069> Jupiter<00:02:47.069> well<00:02:47.730> he<00:02:48.120> is<00:02:49.340> debilitated

00:02:50.330 --> 00:02:50.340 
energy of Jupiter well he is debilitated

00:02:50.340 --> 00:02:53.449 
energy of Jupiter well he is debilitated
he<00:02:50.730> is<00:02:50.880> going<00:02:51.120> to<00:02:51.360> be<00:02:51.510> in<00:02:51.840> certain<00:02:52.530> vortexes

00:02:53.449 --> 00:02:53.459 
he is going to be in certain vortexes

00:02:53.459 --> 00:02:58.100 
he is going to be in certain vortexes
and<00:02:54.500> the<00:02:55.500> what<00:02:55.650> access<00:02:56.100> will<00:02:56.940> be<00:02:56.970> listed<00:02:57.870> in
