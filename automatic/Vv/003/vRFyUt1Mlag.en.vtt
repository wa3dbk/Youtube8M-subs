the toys but there weren't a lot of toys
of<00:03:21.090> just<00:03:21.300> the<00:03:21.420> scientists<00:03:21.960> playing<00:03:22.260> with<00:03:22.500> like

00:03:22.670 --> 00:03:22.680 
of just the scientists playing with like

00:03:22.680 --> 00:03:25.010 
of just the scientists playing with like
DNA<00:03:23.220> sequencing<00:03:24.030> machine<00:03:24.450> yeah<00:03:24.690> something

00:03:25.010 --> 00:03:25.020 
DNA sequencing machine yeah something

00:03:25.020 --> 00:03:26.990 
DNA sequencing machine yeah something
that<00:03:25.170> and<00:03:25.290> then<00:03:25.380> taking<00:03:25.740> frog<00:03:26.070> DNA<00:03:26.400> and<00:03:26.730> plug

00:03:26.990 --> 00:03:27.000 
that and then taking frog DNA and plug

00:03:27.000 --> 00:03:29.420 
that and then taking frog DNA and plug
in<00:03:27.120> the<00:03:27.240> gaps<00:03:27.450> it<00:03:28.140> was<00:03:28.410> about<00:03:28.680> the<00:03:28.950> shooting<00:03:29.370> a

00:03:29.420 --> 00:03:29.430 
in the gaps it was about the shooting a

00:03:29.430 --> 00:03:31.340 
in the gaps it was about the shooting a
net<00:03:29.700> a<00:03:29.730> Velociraptor<00:03:30.600> so<00:03:30.780> we<00:03:30.870> do<00:03:31.050> sort<00:03:31.290> of

00:03:31.340 --> 00:03:31.350 
net a Velociraptor so we do sort of

00:03:31.350 --> 00:03:34.250 
net a Velociraptor so we do sort of
idealize<00:03:31.950> that<00:03:32.310> yes<00:03:33.120> the<00:03:33.300> expected<00:03:33.930> gender

00:03:34.250 --> 00:03:34.260 
idealize that yes the expected gender

00:03:34.260 --> 00:03:35.540 
idealize that yes the expected gender
norms<00:03:34.560> whatever<00:03:34.860> but<00:03:35.040> but<00:03:35.190> that's<00:03:35.280> really

00:03:35.540 --> 00:03:35.550 
norms whatever but but that's really

00:03:35.550 --> 00:03:36.350 
norms whatever but but that's really
what<00:03:35.730> we're<00:03:35.880> worried<00:03:36.120> about

00:03:36.350 --> 00:03:36.360 
what we're worried about

00:03:36.360 --> 00:03:38.420 
what we're worried about
do<00:03:36.750> you<00:03:37.020> think<00:03:37.410> that<00:03:37.770> that<00:03:38.040> this<00:03:38.160> sort<00:03:38.400> of

00:03:38.420 --> 00:03:38.430 
do you think that that this sort of

00:03:38.430 --> 00:03:39.980 
do you think that that this sort of
commercialization<00:03:38.850> and<00:03:39.360> getting<00:03:39.630> girls<00:03:39.900> to

00:03:39.980 --> 00:03:39.990 
commercialization and getting girls to

00:03:39.990 --> 00:03:42.170 
commercialization and getting girls to
imagine<00:03:40.530> wearing<00:03:40.770> the<00:03:41.310> tiaras<00:03:41.880> and<00:03:42.120> the

00:03:42.170 --> 00:03:42.180 
imagine wearing the tiaras and the

00:03:42.180 --> 00:03:43.880 
imagine wearing the tiaras and the
dresses<00:03:42.540> and<00:03:42.690> everything<00:03:42.720> takes<00:03:43.560> away<00:03:43.860> from

00:03:43.880 --> 00:03:43.890 
dresses and everything takes away from

00:03:43.890 --> 00:03:46.670 
dresses and everything takes away from
the<00:03:44.160> positive<00:03:44.700> pot<00:03:45.330> like<00:03:45.720> the<00:03:45.930> the<00:03:46.230> output

00:03:46.670 --> 00:03:46.680 
the positive pot like the the output

00:03:46.680 --> 00:03:48.590 
the positive pot like the the output
like<00:03:46.830> bail<00:03:47.250> and<00:03:47.580> being<00:03:47.880> in<00:03:47.970> the<00:03:48.030> books<00:03:48.270> and

00:03:48.590 --> 00:03:48.600 
like bail and being in the books and

00:03:48.600 --> 00:03:50.120 
like bail and being in the books and
Elson<00:03:49.020> baby<00:03:49.410> this<00:03:49.590> just<00:03:49.830> seems<00:03:50.070> like

00:03:50.120 --> 00:03:50.130 
Elson baby this just seems like

00:03:50.130 --> 00:03:52.520 
Elson baby this just seems like
corporate<00:03:50.610> dissonance<00:03:51.060> like<00:03:51.600> it<00:03:51.750> seems<00:03:52.110> like

00:03:52.520 --> 00:03:52.530 
corporate dissonance like it seems like

00:03:52.530 --> 00:03:55.850 
corporate dissonance like it seems like
there<00:03:52.920> is<00:03:53.130> a<00:03:53.280> group<00:03:54.000> it<00:03:54.360> within<00:03:54.630> Disney<00:03:55.260> that

00:03:55.850 --> 00:03:55.860 
there is a group it within Disney that

00:04:32.690 --> 00:04:34.360 
history so there's that so I think the
story<00:04:33.200> Department<00:04:33.530> they<00:04:33.830> point<00:04:34.070> this<00:04:34.160> out

00:04:34.360 --> 00:04:34.370 
story Department they point this out

00:04:34.370 --> 00:04:36.040 
story Department they point this out
very<00:04:34.400> well<00:04:34.610> the<00:04:34.880> story<00:04:35.360> departments<00:04:35.930> are

00:04:36.040 --> 00:04:36.050 
very well the story departments are

00:04:36.050 --> 00:04:38.800 
very well the story departments are
doing<00:04:36.080> great<00:04:36.830> the<00:04:37.580> problem<00:04:38.120> is<00:04:38.300> there<00:04:38.660> is

00:04:38.800 --> 00:04:38.810 
doing great the problem is there is

00:04:38.810 --> 00:04:40.510 
doing great the problem is there is
another<00:04:39.140> part<00:04:39.500> of<00:04:39.620> Disney<00:04:40.040> that<00:04:40.220> is<00:04:40.370> the

00:04:40.510 --> 00:04:40.520 
another part of Disney that is the

00:04:40.520 --> 00:04:42.340 
another part of Disney that is the
merchandising<00:04:41.120> department<00:04:41.480> that<00:04:41.570> has<00:04:41.720> quotas

00:04:42.340 --> 00:04:42.350 
merchandising department that has quotas

00:04:42.350 --> 00:04:42.940 
merchandising department that has quotas
yeah

00:04:42.940 --> 00:04:42.950

00:04:42.950 --> 00:04:45.040 
yeah
and<00:04:43.040> has<00:04:43.250> still<00:04:43.610> found<00:04:44.090> a<00:04:44.420> way<00:04:44.450> now<00:04:44.840> I<00:04:44.870> think

00:04:45.040 --> 00:04:45.050 
and has still found a way now I think

00:04:45.050 --> 00:04:47.860 
and has still found a way now I think
something<00:04:45.710> to<00:04:45.890> think<00:04:46.040> about<00:04:46.220> is<00:04:46.550> the<00:04:47.270> parents

00:04:47.860 --> 00:04:47.870 
something to think about is the parents

00:04:47.870 --> 00:04:49.630 
something to think about is the parents
are<00:04:47.990> the<00:04:48.080> ones<00:04:48.260> buying<00:04:48.740> these<00:04:49.100> things<00:04:49.430> for

00:04:49.630 --> 00:04:49.640

and the parents are grew up in that

00:04:53.750 --> 00:04:56.410 
and the parents are grew up in that
Disney<00:04:54.740> mentality<00:04:55.490> of<00:04:55.670> the<00:04:55.910> pretty<00:04:56.180> pretty

princess<00:04:56.510> and<00:04:57.290> those<00:04:57.950> are<00:04:58.130> the<00:04:58.220> ones<00:04:58.460> who<00:04:58.730> are

00:04:58.750 --> 00:04:58.760 
princess and those are the ones who are

00:04:58.760 --> 00:05:00.970 
princess and those are the ones who are
allowing<00:04:59.570> that<00:04:59.660> all<00:04:59.840> to<00:04:59.960> bear<00:05:00.140> out<00:05:00.320> maybe<00:05:00.650> when

00:05:00.970 --> 00:05:00.980 
allowing that all to bear out maybe when

00:05:00.980 --> 00:05:04.720 
allowing that all to bear out maybe when
the<00:05:01.130> kids<00:05:01.160> get<00:05:01.820> older<00:05:02.270> they'll<00:05:03.430> have<00:05:04.430> that

00:05:04.720 --> 00:05:04.730 
the kids get older they'll have that

00:05:04.730 --> 00:05:06.280 
the kids get older they'll have that
awareness<00:05:04.970> because<00:05:05.630> right<00:05:05.780> now<00:05:05.870> I<00:05:05.930> think<00:05:06.050> it's

00:05:06.280 --> 00:05:06.290 
awareness because right now I think it's

00:05:06.290 --> 00:05:07.750 
awareness because right now I think it's
subconscious<00:05:06.470> it's<00:05:07.040> like<00:05:07.160> I<00:05:07.250> got<00:05:07.400> a<00:05:07.430> girl<00:05:07.700> I

00:05:07.750 --> 00:05:07.760 
subconscious it's like I got a girl I

00:05:07.760 --> 00:05:09.130 
subconscious it's like I got a girl I
buy<00:05:08.000> our<00:05:08.150> princess<00:05:08.600> stuff<00:05:08.840> because

00:05:09.130 --> 00:05:09.140 
buy our princess stuff because

00:05:09.140 --> 00:05:10.570 
buy our princess stuff because
princesses<00:05:09.710> are<00:05:09.830> pretty<00:05:10.040> and<00:05:10.280> that's<00:05:10.460> what

00:05:10.570 --> 00:05:10.580 
princesses are pretty and that's what

00:05:10.580 --> 00:05:11.950

they're<00:05:10.670> raised<00:05:10.880> on<00:05:11.060> and<00:05:11.330> so<00:05:11.510> I<00:05:11.540> think<00:05:11.660> in<00:05:11.870> the

00:05:11.950 --> 00:05:11.960 
they're raised on and so I think in the

00:05:11.960 --> 00:05:14.620 
they're raised on and so I think in the
future<00:05:12.140> maybe<00:05:12.560> these<00:05:12.950> girls<00:05:13.730> who<00:05:13.940> grew<00:05:14.180> up

00:05:14.620 --> 00:05:14.630
