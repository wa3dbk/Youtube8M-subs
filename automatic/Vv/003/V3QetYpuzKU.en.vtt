night<00:00:12.780> think<00:00:12.990> he's<00:00:13.259> very<00:00:13.469> elegant<00:00:14.309> he's

00:00:14.720 --> 00:00:14.730 
night think he's very elegant he's

00:00:14.730 --> 00:00:32.269 
night think he's very elegant he's
technically<00:00:15.210> consistent<00:00:16.080> he's<00:00:16.410> musical<00:00:31.279> his

00:00:32.269 --> 00:00:32.279 
technically consistent he's musical his

00:00:32.279 --> 00:00:33.650 
technically consistent he's musical his
first<00:00:32.669> move

00:00:33.650 --> 00:00:33.660 
first move

00:00:33.660 --> 00:01:02.330

the<00:00:33.840> infamous<00:00:34.230> triple<00:00:34.920> axel

00:01:02.330 --> 00:01:02.340 

00:01:02.340 --> 00:02:23.380 

it's<00:01:03.340> triple-jump<00:01:03.880> combination

00:02:23.380 --> 00:02:23.390 

00:02:23.390 --> 00:02:27.470 

so<00:02:24.390> I<00:02:24.420> need<00:02:24.780> these<00:02:25.440> moves<00:02:26.000> so<00:02:27.000> the<00:02:27.030> program<00:02:27.450> is

00:02:27.470 --> 00:02:27.480 
so I need these moves so the program is

00:02:27.480 --> 00:02:31.460 
so I need these moves so the program is
interesting<00:02:28.940> has<00:02:29.940> variation<00:02:30.629> and<00:02:31.170> he

00:02:31.460 --> 00:02:31.470 
interesting has variation and he

00:02:31.470 --> 00:02:38.059 
interesting has variation and he
certainly<00:02:31.709> is<00:02:31.950> putting<00:02:32.220> energy<00:02:32.400> into<00:02:32.819> it<00:02:37.069> mark

00:02:38.059 --> 00:02:38.069 
certainly is putting energy into it mark

00:02:38.069 --> 00:02:39.979 
certainly is putting energy into it mark
