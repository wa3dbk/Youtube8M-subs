00:00:03.859 --> 00:00:07.500
 Hello everyone guys and welcome to 

00:00:06.480 --> 00:00:09.840
 this new review 

00:00:07.500 --> 00:00:11.940
 in this video we will see lorans a mouse 

00:00:09.840 --> 00:00:14.160
 produced by youtech smart was 

00:00:11.940 --> 00:00:15.389
 designed for mmo but that's fine 

00:00:14.160 --> 00:00:17.970
 for any use 

00:00:15.389 --> 00:00:19.859
 its price is 40 euros and can be 

00:00:17.970 --> 00:00:22.380
 you can find the link on amazon 

00:00:19.859 --> 00:00:24.000
 in the video description 

00:00:22.380 --> 00:00:25.019
 let's start right away analyzing the content 

00:00:24.000 --> 00:00:27.390
 of the package 

00:00:25.019 --> 00:00:29.250
 here we find a case to avoid 

00:00:27.390 --> 00:00:31.560
 lose the small countries precisely for the 

00:00:29.250 --> 00:00:33.300
 mouse weight adjustment 

00:00:31.560 --> 00:00:34.620
 then we find the contacts for support 

00:00:33.300 --> 00:00:36.360
 technical 

00:00:34.620 --> 00:00:38.460
 a guide for using the mouse and the 

00:00:36.360 --> 00:00:40.230
 software we can 

00:00:38.460 --> 00:00:42.989
 install it through the CD provided by 

00:00:40.230 --> 00:00:44.969
 utech smart we also find stickers 

00:00:42.989 --> 00:00:48.239
 in Teflon for the lower part of the 

00:00:44.969 --> 00:00:49.920
 mouse and of course the hour nus 

00:00:48.239 --> 00:00:51.860
 its design is very appealing has 

00:00:49.920 --> 00:00:53.850
 predominantly an opaque black color 

00:00:51.860 --> 00:00:55.550
 also due to the rubber coating 

00:00:53.850 --> 00:00:57.899
 which is very pleasant to the touch 

00:00:55.550 --> 00:00:59.789
 unfortunately given its shape and if it goes 

00:00:57.899 --> 00:01:02.370
 good only for right-handed and there is no one 

00:00:59.789 --> 00:01:03.899
 left-handed version in the part of the 

00:01:02.370 --> 00:01:05.129
 evening on the left there are five buttons 

00:01:03.899 --> 00:01:06.869
 programmable 

00:01:05.129 --> 00:01:08.549
 they have a curved shape and are 

00:01:06.869 --> 00:01:11.010
 positioned so as to guarantee a 

00:01:08.549 --> 00:01:13.500
 good grip without bothering 

00:01:11.010 --> 00:01:15.390
 fingers positioned at that point in 

00:01:13.500 --> 00:01:17.250
 effects holding the mouse we notice that 

00:01:15.390 --> 00:01:18.299
 they are quite well positioned and easy 

00:01:17.250 --> 00:01:19.979
 to reach 

00:01:18.299 --> 00:01:21.600
 except maybe for the last one that 

00:01:19.979 --> 00:01:24.049
 to be reached it makes us move a 

00:01:21.600 --> 00:01:24.049
 little hand 

00:01:24.220 --> 00:01:27.640
 in the right side are 

00:01:26.260 --> 00:01:29.080
 present of the grooves for 

00:01:27.640 --> 00:01:30.490
 improve grip 

00:01:29.080 --> 00:01:32.290
 thanks to these small details in the 

00:01:30.490 --> 00:01:35.620
 Its shape makes the mouse very comfortable 

00:01:32.290 --> 00:01:37.300
 and be a good control of it 

00:01:35.620 --> 00:01:38.740
 in the back we find the logo 

00:01:37.300 --> 00:01:40.060
 of the youtek smart made with a 

00:01:38.740 --> 00:01:42.730
 transparent material for the 

00:01:40.060 --> 00:01:45.130
 backlight at the top 

00:01:42.730 --> 00:01:47.710
 in addition to the classic right-click left 

00:01:45.130 --> 00:01:49.630
 and the wheel we find five more 

00:01:47.710 --> 00:01:52.600
 therefore programmable buttons in total 

00:01:49.630 --> 00:01:54.070
 we have 13 for the 4 in the part 

00:01:52.600 --> 00:01:55.900
 superior we will have to get used to it 

00:01:54.070 --> 00:01:59.110
 because initially they won't be their own 

00:01:55.900 --> 00:02:01.390
 comfortable the wheel is quite well 

00:01:59.110 --> 00:02:03.760
 made with an acceptable precision 

00:02:01.390 --> 00:02:04.869
 outside also like the body of the 

00:02:03.760 --> 00:02:08.500
 mouse has a coating 

00:02:04.869 --> 00:02:10.330
 chewy looking in the part 

00:02:08.500 --> 00:02:11.770
 inferior of the uranus we immediately notice that 

00:02:10.330 --> 00:02:12.730
 the surface is completely made 

00:02:11.770 --> 00:02:15.070
 in aluminum 

00:02:12.730 --> 00:02:17.650
 which adds some positive notes in 

00:02:15.070 --> 00:02:19.240
 more to its build quality 

00:02:17.650 --> 00:02:20.950
 here we also find the housing for 

00:02:19.240 --> 00:02:23.260
 the weight adjustment system 

00:02:20.950 --> 00:02:26.350
 we have the possibility to add 8 

00:02:23.260 --> 00:02:28.870
 countries of 2.4 grams each for a total 

00:02:26.350 --> 00:02:30.580
 of 19 grams to adjust to ours 

00:02:28.870 --> 00:02:32.860
 liking its weight 

00:02:30.580 --> 00:02:36.330
 the maximum weight that can reach point 

00:02:32.860 --> 00:02:38.860
 of these added countries is 180 g 

00:02:36.330 --> 00:02:41.019
 always this lower part is present 

00:02:38.860 --> 00:02:44.530
 obviously the sensor is a 

00:02:41.019 --> 00:02:46.690
 vague laser sensor at 16,400 dpi 

00:02:44.530 --> 00:02:48.760
 this choice was made only for 

00:02:46.690 --> 00:02:50.890
 marketing remember that the quality of 

00:02:48.760 --> 00:02:53.080
 sensor is not judged by the number of 

00:02:50.890 --> 00:02:56.980
 dpa also because it would be unusable 

00:02:53.080 --> 00:02:58.540
 the 16.400 however all in all though 

00:02:56.980 --> 00:03:00.730
 being the laser sensor it behaves 

00:02:58.540 --> 00:03:03.700
 quite well and is accurate 

00:03:00.730 --> 00:03:05.980
 I have tried on various games si mmo that fps 

00:03:03.700 --> 00:03:08.280
 higher we find the button for 

00:03:05.980 --> 00:03:11.110
 change the settings profile 

00:03:08.280 --> 00:03:13.150
 for the Lurano connectivity it is equipped 

00:03:11.110 --> 00:03:15.070
 of a cable almost two meters long and it is 

00:03:13.150 --> 00:03:18.940
 braided for better strength 

00:03:15.070 --> 00:03:20.920
 the usb plug and type 2.0 plated in 

00:03:18.940 --> 00:03:22.390
 gold and its shape makes it stand out 

00:03:20.920 --> 00:03:23.819
 among others connected to the card 

00:03:22.390 --> 00:03:25.620
 mother 

00:03:23.819 --> 00:03:27.840
 the last thing we have left to look at is 

00:03:25.620 --> 00:03:30.299
 the software is very similar to the others 

00:03:27.840 --> 00:03:31.530
 products made by youtech smart is more or 

00:03:30.299 --> 00:03:33.659
 less the same as venus 

00:03:31.530 --> 00:03:35.280
 the software allows us to easily 

00:03:33.659 --> 00:03:37.469
 program every single button of the 

00:03:35.280 --> 00:03:39.180
 mouse is also equipped with a very large 

00:03:37.469 --> 00:03:41.010
 number of macros that are easy to 

00:03:39.180 --> 00:03:44.099
 record via the macro function 

00:03:41.010 --> 00:03:45.200
 manager I found very useful in the video 

00:03:44.099 --> 00:03:48.120
 editing 

00:03:45.200 --> 00:03:50.340
 then we can adjust the acceleration 

00:03:48.120 --> 00:03:52.469
 pointer speed the speed of 

00:03:50.340 --> 00:03:54.870
 scroll a second window 

00:03:52.469 --> 00:03:57.959
 we can adjust the dpi for each level 

00:03:54.870 --> 00:03:59.819
 we have a total of 5 last 

00:03:57.959 --> 00:04:02.549
 window we have the adjustment of the 

00:03:59.819 --> 00:04:04.650
 lighting here we can choose between 

00:04:02.549 --> 00:04:07.439
 of the colors already set or we can 

00:04:04.650 --> 00:04:08.849
 create us what we like most there 

00:04:07.439 --> 00:04:11.069
 are 16 million colors 

00:04:08.849 --> 00:04:13.169
 from here we can also select 

00:04:11.069 --> 00:04:16.320
 the intensity of the light and if we want the 

00:04:13.169 --> 00:04:18.750
 flashing for settings 

00:04:16.320 --> 00:04:20.220
 we have 5 available with wires and yes 

00:04:18.750 --> 00:04:22.259
 they will also determine the color 

00:04:20.220 --> 00:04:26.300
 wheel illumination e 

00:04:22.259 --> 00:04:28.470
 it will be blue yellow green blue or purple 

00:04:26.300 --> 00:04:30.750
 so for the lottery I had a 

00:04:28.470 --> 00:04:33.990
 arrangement of five colors for the logo 

00:04:30.750 --> 00:04:35.340
 rear 16 million and led that 

00:04:33.990 --> 00:04:39.810
 indicate the level of who you have 

00:04:35.340 --> 00:04:42.000
 they will always be red then what to say of 

00:04:39.810 --> 00:04:43.229
 this mouse uranus is certainly good 

00:04:42.000 --> 00:04:45.900
 his work at a price enough 

00:04:43.229 --> 00:04:48.380
 honest and very versatile as it is 

00:04:45.900 --> 00:04:51.690
 fits all games both mmo and well 

00:04:48.380 --> 00:04:53.449
 fps thanks also to common sense re la 

00:04:51.690 --> 00:04:56.039
 presence of many programmable buttons 

00:04:53.449 --> 00:04:58.440
 macros and the system are also very useful 

00:04:56.039 --> 00:05:00.090
 I liked the weight adjustment 

00:04:58.440 --> 00:05:02.250
 very even now that fits form 

00:05:00.090 --> 00:05:03.990
 good at hand and build quality 

00:05:02.250 --> 00:05:05.880
 as for the 

00:05:03.990 --> 00:05:07.080
 backlight I would have preferred a 

00:05:05.880 --> 00:05:09.240
 best lighting control 

00:05:07.080 --> 00:05:10.979
 the wheel would have been nice 

00:05:09.240 --> 00:05:13.229
 have 16 million colors possible 

00:05:10.979 --> 00:05:15.750
 also on it for better 

00:05:13.229 --> 00:05:17.190
 uniformity and with regard to the 

00:05:15.750 --> 00:05:20.009
 sensor I would have preferred by far 

00:05:17.190 --> 00:05:23.270
 find an optical even from a few dpi e 

00:05:20.009 --> 00:05:25.050
 not an exaggerated laser at 16,400 

00:05:23.270 --> 00:05:27.570
 let me know below in the comments 

00:05:25.050 --> 00:05:29.130
 what do you think of this uranus e 

00:05:27.570 --> 00:05:30.289
 if there is any more valid alternative 

00:05:29.130 --> 00:05:32.809
 always 40 euros 

00:05:30.289 --> 00:05:34.729
 if you liked the review remember 

00:05:32.809 --> 00:05:37.360
 to leave a like and we'll see you in 

00:05:34.729 --> 00:05:37.360
 next video
