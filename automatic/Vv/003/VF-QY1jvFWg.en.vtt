00:00:12.330 --> 00:00:17.110
 speaks again who's talking here 

00:00:14.650 --> 00:00:18.790
 fernandinho da ff tactics come and bring 

00:00:17.110 --> 00:00:20.800
 all pray more doubt some 

00:00:18.790 --> 00:00:22.990
 clients I have that is about one 

00:00:20.800 --> 00:00:25.360
 member for luc 1 blue very used for 

00:00:22.990 --> 00:00:26.710
 fish from large oceanic fish and even 

00:00:25.360 --> 00:00:28.570
 even the live bait 

00:00:26.710 --> 00:00:30.880
 due to the ease of it does not pull the 

00:00:28.570 --> 00:00:32.890
 fish or I 've never seen a girlfriend is a 

00:00:30.880 --> 00:00:35.260
 reason that the account of him slightly turned 

00:00:32.890 --> 00:00:37.270
 to within plus or circular shape 

00:00:35.260 --> 00:00:40.000
 every time the fish is boka 

00:00:37.270 --> 00:00:42.070
 He will always catch on the roof of the mouth will 

00:00:40.000 --> 00:00:44.020
 always slip off hunting the corner of the 

00:00:42.070 --> 00:00:46.510
 pond of the only fish we are going to say like this 

00:00:44.020 --> 00:00:49.180
 by the manual of your sun and whether or not 

00:00:46.510 --> 00:00:50.680
 should be worn aside or be stuck 

00:00:49.180 --> 00:00:53.530
 fixedly because otherwise simply 

00:00:50.680 --> 00:00:56.320
 left the model and used will flow through the 

00:00:53.530 --> 00:00:58.600
 mouth not voicing corner the decision isf 

00:00:56.320 --> 00:01:00.370
 let him get loose on the line for this 

00:00:58.600 --> 00:01:02.860
 I'm going to teach you a lot today. 

00:01:00.370 --> 00:01:04.930
 easy to do that neither the fpf 

00:01:02.860 --> 00:01:07.540
 people do the pages of each 

00:01:04.930 --> 00:01:09.250
 customer it is very easy you can 

00:01:07.540 --> 00:01:11.530
 see take a look here or here you 

00:01:09.250 --> 00:01:13.180
 You can use your carbon flow to run 

00:01:11.530 --> 00:01:14.950
 the same way as always managing the 

00:01:13.180 --> 00:01:20.399
 which is to represent the 

00:01:14.950 --> 00:01:24.840
 two you'd first give a us ego 

00:01:20.399 --> 00:01:24.840
 everyone knows as follows 

00:01:25.380 --> 00:01:34.630
 catch a hook would tip the 

00:01:31.659 --> 00:01:37.120
 butt our next way 

00:01:34.630 --> 00:01:41.170
 when you can see 

00:01:37.120 --> 00:01:44.430
 would take the end of the line would 

00:01:41.170 --> 00:01:44.430
 within our ego 

00:01:45.870 --> 00:01:51.040
 exactly this way 

00:01:48.930 --> 00:01:52.960
 now the big bid 

00:01:51.040 --> 00:01:55.990
 this is the main line this 

00:01:52.960 --> 00:02:01.110
 end you 'd catch the end and 

00:01:55.990 --> 00:02:04.870
 would make three laps on the main line 

00:02:01.110 --> 00:02:09.119
 so that they reach the end of the 

00:02:04.870 --> 00:02:13.740
 and pass through our ego. 

00:02:09.119 --> 00:02:13.740
 and so and adjusting the knot 

00:02:19.270 --> 00:02:25.360
 the tip always has to stay out of the 

00:02:22.420 --> 00:02:27.700
 North always out or is this 

00:02:25.360 --> 00:02:29.650
 form what will happen 

00:02:27.700 --> 00:02:33.490
 your hook cycle that it will stay 

00:02:29.650 --> 00:02:36.310
 simply dropped inside the line or 

00:02:33.490 --> 00:02:38.140
 be it always if the fish picks it up 

00:02:36.310 --> 00:02:39.900
 You will always have the possibility to 

00:02:38.140 --> 00:02:42.700
 the corners of the mouth can not pull 

00:02:39.900 --> 00:02:45.250
 facilitating their fishing and helping 

00:02:42.700 --> 00:02:48.100
 time of removal of the same sun or 

00:02:45.250 --> 00:02:50.410
 right people in time to make the endorsement of 

00:02:48.100 --> 00:02:53.140
 circle that practices and is already 

00:02:50.410 --> 00:02:56.110
 dead what ever it is is to use 

00:02:53.140 --> 00:02:58.930
 this way an aid huck it was 

00:02:56.110 --> 00:03:00.610
 made to be loose on the line is not for 

00:02:58.930 --> 00:03:03.190
 to tie it has to be extremely 

00:03:00.610 --> 00:03:05.500
 so that it is precisely to be able to hunt the 

00:03:03.190 --> 00:03:08.890
 corner of the mouth as you 

00:03:05.500 --> 00:03:11.700
 I'd take what's left 

00:03:08.890 --> 00:03:14.080
 the concierge with the appropriate theory 

00:03:11.700 --> 00:03:18.310
 would take the left of the type but there with the 

00:03:14.080 --> 00:03:22.900
 call dense would finish in 

00:03:18.310 --> 00:03:25.270
 end helping to become a showy 

00:03:22.900 --> 00:03:26.980
 and certainly much safer, and if I 

00:03:25.270 --> 00:03:28.930
 I assure you that certainly not 

00:03:26.980 --> 00:03:31.300
 only on the periphery of you 

00:03:28.930 --> 00:03:34.240
 this was one more tip of the galley that 

00:03:31.300 --> 00:03:36.250
 df fishing and for sure I'm not very 

00:03:34.240 --> 00:03:36.970
 more hints to the difficulties you have 

00:03:36.250 --> 00:03:40.590
 in the fishery 

00:03:36.970 --> 00:03:40.590
 guys a hug and see you soon
