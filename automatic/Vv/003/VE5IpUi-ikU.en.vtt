jailbreak<00:00:06.160> was<00:00:06.790> just<00:00:07.180> released<00:00:07.540> so<00:00:07.720> I<00:00:07.779> thought

00:00:07.950 --> 00:00:07.960 
jailbreak was just released so I thought

00:00:07.960 --> 00:00:09.660 
jailbreak was just released so I thought
I'd<00:00:08.139> do<00:00:08.260> a<00:00:08.290> quick<00:00:08.530> little<00:00:08.680> video<00:00:08.889> guide<00:00:09.309> on<00:00:09.490> it

00:00:09.660 --> 00:00:09.670 
I'd do a quick little video guide on it

00:00:09.670 --> 00:00:12.450 
I'd do a quick little video guide on it
so<00:00:10.660> basically<00:00:11.139> this<00:00:11.349> is<00:00:11.410> exactly<00:00:12.010> like<00:00:12.100> the

00:00:12.450 --> 00:00:12.460 
so basically this is exactly like the

00:00:12.460 --> 00:00:13.980 
so basically this is exactly like the
lie<00:00:12.700> marine<00:00:13.000> jailbreak<00:00:13.390> that<00:00:13.570> i<00:00:13.600> did<00:00:13.780> a<00:00:13.810> video

00:00:13.980 --> 00:00:13.990 
lie marine jailbreak that i did a video

00:00:13.990 --> 00:00:15.930 
lie marine jailbreak that i did a video
on<00:00:14.200> yesterday<00:00:14.800> they<00:00:15.640> use<00:00:15.790> the<00:00:15.910> same

00:00:15.930 --> 00:00:15.940 
on yesterday they use the same

00:00:15.940 --> 00:00:17.609 
on yesterday they use the same
exploiting<00:00:16.630> everything<00:00:16.930> and<00:00:17.109> it<00:00:17.199> only<00:00:17.320> works

00:00:17.609 --> 00:00:17.619 
exploiting everything and it only works

00:00:17.619 --> 00:00:19.439 
exploiting everything and it only works
with<00:00:17.830> the<00:00:17.949> same<00:00:18.220> devices<00:00:18.609> so<00:00:19.029> it's<00:00:19.240> not<00:00:19.390> really

00:00:19.439 --> 00:00:19.449 
with the same devices so it's not really

00:00:19.449 --> 00:00:22.319 
with the same devices so it's not really
a<00:00:19.749> great<00:00:20.109> improvement<00:00:20.650> but<00:00:21.640> i<00:00:21.909> thought<00:00:22.060> i'd<00:00:22.210> do

00:00:22.319 --> 00:00:22.329 
a great improvement but i thought i'd do

00:00:22.329 --> 00:00:23.909 
a great improvement but i thought i'd do
a<00:00:22.359> quick<00:00:22.539> little<00:00:22.659> video<00:00:22.810> on<00:00:23.079> it<00:00:23.230> so<00:00:23.800> this

00:00:23.909 --> 00:00:23.919 
a quick little video on it so this

00:00:23.919 --> 00:00:26.399

and<00:02:30.080> open<00:02:30.290> it<00:02:30.349> up<00:02:30.530> now<00:02:31.040> this<00:02:31.190> program<00:02:31.700> is

00:02:31.869 --> 00:02:31.879 
and open it up now this program is

00:02:31.879 --> 00:02:34.570 
and open it up now this program is
basically<00:02:32.299> exactly<00:02:32.720> like<00:02:33.260> lime<00:02:34.069> rain<00:02:34.310> so<00:02:34.459> I'm

00:02:34.570 --> 00:02:34.580 
basically exactly like lime rain so I'm

00:02:34.580 --> 00:02:36.550 
basically exactly like lime rain so I'm
kind<00:02:35.030> of<00:02:35.090> confused<00:02:35.269> as<00:02:35.690> why<00:02:35.870> they<00:02:36.019> released<00:02:36.379> it

00:02:36.550 --> 00:02:36.560 
kind of confused as why they released it

00:02:36.560 --> 00:02:37.660 
kind of confused as why they released it
because<00:02:36.799> it<00:02:36.950> doesn't<00:02:37.280> really<00:02:37.459> do<00:02:37.640> much

00:02:37.660 --> 00:02:37.670 
because it doesn't really do much

00:02:37.670 --> 00:02:39.759 
because it doesn't really do much
different<00:02:38.330> but<00:02:38.810> it<00:02:38.959> does<00:02:39.140> seem<00:02:39.319> actually<00:02:39.739> a

00:02:39.759 --> 00:02:39.769 
different but it does seem actually a

00:02:39.769 --> 00:02:42.809 
different but it does seem actually a
little<00:02:39.890> bit<00:02:40.099> Stabler<00:02:40.580> I<00:02:40.760> than<00:02:41.299> la<00:02:41.480> marine<00:02:41.780> so

00:02:42.809 --> 00:02:42.819 
little bit Stabler I than la marine so

00:02:42.819 --> 00:02:44.589 
little bit Stabler I than la marine so
basically<00:02:43.819> what<00:02:43.970> you're<00:02:44.000> going<00:02:44.120> to<00:02:44.269> do<00:02:44.360> first

00:02:44.589 --> 00:02:44.599 
basically what you're going to do first

00:02:44.599 --> 00:02:45.820 
basically what you're going to do first
is<00:02:44.989> you're<00:02:45.200> going<00:02:45.290> to<00:02:45.379> need<00:02:45.470> to<00:02:45.560> turn<00:02:45.709> your

00:02:45.820 --> 00:02:45.830 
is you're going to need to turn your

00:02:45.830 --> 00:02:47.770 
is you're going to need to turn your
device<00:02:45.950> off<00:02:46.400> so<00:02:47.030> let's<00:02:47.209> go<00:02:47.360> ahead<00:02:47.390> and<00:02:47.599> do<00:02:47.750> that

00:02:47.770 --> 00:02:47.780 
device off so let's go ahead and do that

00:02:47.780 --> 00:02:50.350 
device off so let's go ahead and do that
now<00:02:47.959> and<00:02:48.860> then<00:02:49.489> you're<00:02:49.610> going<00:02:49.790> to<00:02:49.910> go<00:02:50.120> on<00:02:50.239> at

00:02:50.350 --> 00:02:50.360 
now and then you're going to go on at

00:02:50.360 --> 00:02:53.620 
now and then you're going to go on at
the<00:02:50.450> jailbreak<00:02:51.370> so<00:02:52.370> there<00:02:52.549> we<00:02:52.640> go<00:02:52.760> basically

00:02:53.620 --> 00:02:53.630 
the jailbreak so there we go basically

00:02:53.630 --> 00:02:55.000 
the jailbreak so there we go basically
what<00:02:53.750> we're<00:02:53.870> going<00:02:53.959> to<00:02:54.049> do<00:02:54.230> is<00:02:54.470> hold<00:02:54.739> the<00:02:54.829> power

00:02:55.000 --> 00:02:55.010 
what we're going to do is hold the power

00:02:55.010 --> 00:02:56.589 
what we're going to do is hold the power
button<00:02:55.099> in<00:02:55.400> for<00:02:55.610> about<00:02:55.730> two<00:02:55.910> to<00:02:55.940> three<00:02:56.030> seconds

00:02:56.589 --> 00:02:56.599 
button in for about two to three seconds

00:02:56.599 --> 00:02:58.000 
button in for about two to three seconds
then<00:02:57.200> we're<00:02:57.290> going<00:02:57.380> to<00:02:57.470> switch<00:02:57.650> it<00:02:57.799> holding

00:02:58.000 --> 00:02:58.010 
then we're going to switch it holding

00:02:58.010 --> 00:02:59.650 
then we're going to switch it holding
both<00:02:58.310> buttons<00:02:58.340> you<00:02:58.940> never<00:02:59.060> release<00:02:59.420> the<00:02:59.510> power

00:02:59.650 --> 00:02:59.660 
both buttons you never release the power

00:02:59.660 --> 00:03:01.780 
both buttons you never release the power
button<00:02:59.920> holding<00:03:00.920> both<00:03:01.099> buttons<00:03:01.129> for<00:03:01.459> about<00:03:01.640> 10

00:03:01.780 --> 00:03:01.790 
button holding both buttons for about 10

00:03:01.790 --> 00:03:03.610 
button holding both buttons for about 10
seconds<00:03:02.209> and<00:03:02.329> then<00:03:02.750> you<00:03:02.870> release<00:03:03.230> the<00:03:03.470> power

00:03:03.610 --> 00:03:03.620 
seconds and then you release the power

00:03:03.620 --> 00:03:04.750 
seconds and then you release the power
button<00:03:03.769> and<00:03:04.129> keep<00:03:04.310> holding<00:03:04.579> the<00:03:04.610> home<00:03:04.730> button

00:03:04.750 --> 00:03:04.760 
button and keep holding the home button

00:03:04.760 --> 00:03:08.589 
button and keep holding the home button
so<00:03:05.150> it<00:03:05.180> goes<00:03:05.450> power<00:03:06.200> both<00:03:07.090> home<00:03:08.090> that's<00:03:08.450> how<00:03:08.569> it

count down there for you so it makes it

00:03:22.940 --> 00:03:24.309 
count down there for you so it makes it
pretty<00:03:23.120> easy<00:03:23.239> if<00:03:23.510> you<00:03:23.600> mess<00:03:23.750> up<00:03:23.930> you<00:03:24.079> can<00:03:24.109> hit<00:03:24.290> a

00:03:24.309 --> 00:03:24.319 
pretty easy if you mess up you can hit a

00:03:24.319 --> 00:03:28.090 
pretty easy if you mess up you can hit a
little<00:03:24.440> reset<00:03:24.920> button<00:03:25.810> 21<00:03:26.810> and<00:03:27.230> there<00:03:27.859> we<00:03:27.950> go

00:03:28.090 --> 00:03:28.100 
little reset button 21 and there we go

00:03:28.100 --> 00:03:29.680 
little reset button 21 and there we go
just<00:03:28.130> release<00:03:28.609> the<00:03:28.790> power<00:03:28.970> and<00:03:29.239> keep<00:03:29.420> on<00:03:29.569> the

00:03:29.680 --> 00:03:29.690 
just release the power and keep on the

00:03:29.690 --> 00:03:31.930 
just release the power and keep on the
home<00:03:29.840> button<00:03:29.870> and<00:03:30.280> then<00:03:31.280> basically<00:03:31.519> it's

00:03:31.930 --> 00:03:31.940 
home button and then basically it's

00:03:31.940 --> 00:03:33.580 
home button and then basically it's
going<00:03:32.269> to<00:03:32.329> put<00:03:32.480> your<00:03:32.569> device<00:03:32.810> into<00:03:33.019> dfu<00:03:33.560> mode

00:03:33.580 --> 00:03:33.590 
going to put your device into dfu mode

00:03:33.590 --> 00:03:35.920 
going to put your device into dfu mode

00:03:35.930 --> 00:03:37.150 
so if this works you should have a black
screen<00:03:36.260> when<00:03:36.530> it's<00:03:36.650> done<00:03:36.769> it<00:03:36.950> should<00:03:37.010> look
