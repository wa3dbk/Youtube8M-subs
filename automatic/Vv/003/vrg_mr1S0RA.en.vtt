there that is very important for the
Java<00:00:12.570> to<00:00:12.690> be<00:00:12.809> updated<00:00:13.200> so<00:00:14.040> the<00:00:14.130> easiest<00:00:14.400> way<00:00:14.549> I

00:00:14.570 --> 00:00:14.580 
Java to be updated so the easiest way I

00:00:14.580 --> 00:00:17.180 
Java to be updated so the easiest way I
I<00:00:15.389> do<00:00:15.540> is<00:00:15.839> just<00:00:16.049> just<00:00:16.500> get<00:00:16.650> right<00:00:16.740> to<00:00:16.800> Java's

00:00:17.180 --> 00:00:17.190 
I do is just just get right to Java's

00:00:17.190 --> 00:00:18.470 
I do is just just get right to Java's
website

00:00:18.470 --> 00:00:18.480 
website

00:00:18.480 --> 00:00:22.340 
website
it's<00:00:19.410> just<00:00:19.590> Java<00:00:19.770> comm<00:00:20.160> and<00:00:21.170> right<00:00:22.170> there

00:00:22.340 --> 00:00:22.350 
it's just Java comm and right there

00:00:22.350 --> 00:00:24.410 
it's just Java comm and right there
you'll<00:00:22.470> see<00:00:22.619> free<00:00:22.920> Java<00:00:23.130> download<00:00:23.220> this<00:00:24.150> works

00:00:24.410 --> 00:00:24.420 
you'll see free Java download this works

00:00:24.420 --> 00:00:25.790 
you'll see free Java download this works
whether<00:00:24.630> you<00:00:24.750> already<00:00:24.960> have<00:00:25.080> it<00:00:25.170> installed<00:00:25.260> or

00:00:31.640 --> 00:00:31.650 
looks exactly the same if you already

00:00:31.650 --> 00:00:33.560 
looks exactly the same if you already
have<00:00:31.830> it<00:00:31.890> installed<00:00:31.980> so<00:00:32.910> you<00:00:33.300> just<00:00:33.390> click

00:00:33.560 --> 00:00:33.570 
have it installed so you just click

00:00:33.570 --> 00:00:35.090 
have it installed so you just click

you're using the same Internet Explorer
version<00:00:42.030> here<00:00:42.210> then<00:00:42.390> it's<00:00:43.020> going<00:00:43.110> to<00:00:43.200> look

00:00:43.310 --> 00:00:43.320

00:00:44.540 --> 00:00:44.550 
exactly the same here I just run it

00:00:44.550 --> 00:00:45.440 
exactly the same here I just run it
straight<00:00:44.730> from<00:00:44.879> your<00:00:45.030> honor<00:00:45.149> to<00:00:45.329> bother

00:00:45.440 --> 00:00:45.450 
straight from your honor to bother

00:00:45.450 --> 00:00:48.770 
straight from your honor to bother
downloading<00:00:45.960> it<00:00:46.050> and<00:00:47.270> it's<00:00:48.270> going<00:00:48.420> to<00:00:48.480> scan

00:00:48.770 --> 00:00:48.780 
downloading it and it's going to scan

00:00:48.780 --> 00:00:52.459 
downloading it and it's going to scan
first<00:00:49.680> couple<00:00:50.129> seconds<00:00:50.430> here<00:00:50.460> and<00:00:51.350> then<00:00:52.350> it

00:00:52.459 --> 00:00:52.469 
first couple seconds here and then it

00:00:52.469 --> 00:00:54.619 
first couple seconds here and then it
should<00:00:52.620> go<00:00:52.739> through<00:00:52.770> the<00:00:53.629> installation

00:00:54.619 --> 00:00:54.629 
should go through the installation

00:00:54.629 --> 00:00:59.950 
should go through the installation
process<00:00:54.809> which<00:00:55.199> only<00:00:55.350> takes<00:00:55.620> a<00:00:55.829> minute<00:00:56.160> or<00:00:56.370> two

00:00:59.950 --> 00:00:59.960 

00:00:59.960 --> 00:01:03.439 

there<00:01:00.960> this<00:01:01.140> is<00:01:01.289> the<00:01:01.410> access<00:01:01.800> user<00:01:02.460> account

00:01:03.439 --> 00:01:03.449 
there this is the access user account

00:01:03.449 --> 00:01:05.299 
there this is the access user account
control<00:01:03.539> so<00:01:03.870> you<00:01:03.930> want<00:01:04.080> to<00:01:04.170> make<00:01:05.070> sure<00:01:05.189> you

00:01:05.299 --> 00:01:05.309 
control so you want to make sure you

00:01:05.309 --> 00:01:08.179 
control so you want to make sure you
allow<00:01:05.700> that<00:01:06.229> and<00:01:07.229> then<00:01:07.770> here's<00:01:07.950> the<00:01:08.010> actual

00:01:08.179 --> 00:01:08.189 
allow that and then here's the actual

00:01:08.189 --> 00:01:14.899 
allow that and then here's the actual
install

00:01:14.899 --> 00:01:14.909 

00:01:14.909 --> 00:01:18.170 

and<00:01:15.060> I<00:01:15.750> always<00:01:16.159> uncheck<00:01:17.159> these<00:01:17.670> extra

00:01:18.170 --> 00:01:18.180 
and I always uncheck these extra

00:01:18.180 --> 00:01:21.219 
and I always uncheck these extra
toolbars<00:01:19.100> don't<00:01:20.100> just<00:01:20.280> click<00:01:20.490> through<00:01:20.670> this

00:01:21.219 --> 00:01:21.229 
toolbars don't just click through this

00:01:21.229 --> 00:01:23.359 
toolbars don't just click through this
this<00:01:22.229> will<00:01:22.439> add<00:01:22.560> something<00:01:22.860> at<00:01:23.039> the<00:01:23.100> top<00:01:23.250> of

00:01:23.359 --> 00:01:23.369 
this will add something at the top of

00:01:23.369 --> 00:01:25.340 
this will add something at the top of
your<00:01:23.460> browser<00:01:23.610> here<00:01:23.939> that<00:01:24.149> before<00:01:25.140> you<00:01:25.259> know
