00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:06.569
 That's the second part of one 

00:00:02.580 --> 00:00:09.540
 course I take the heels wall if 

00:00:06.569 --> 00:00:12.240
 your covenant under creates long enough 

00:00:09.540 --> 00:00:12.900
 then he starts up with the rock 

00:00:12.240 --> 00:00:15.540
 captures 

00:00:12.900 --> 00:00:18.150
 I knit the cuffs most of the time 

00:00:15.540 --> 00:00:21.180
 between five and ten centimeters and 

00:00:18.150 --> 00:00:24.480
 that managed to knit it to the right 

00:00:21.180 --> 00:00:26.970
 also between 5 and 10 cm depending on 

00:00:24.480 --> 00:00:31.170
 who it is as tenfold ten 

00:00:26.970 --> 00:00:34.140
 centimeter cuffs and 5 cm creates the 

00:00:31.170 --> 00:00:37.260
 Heels wall will be between the first and 

00:00:34.140 --> 00:00:39.690
 the fourth needle knitted that is there 

00:00:37.260 --> 00:00:41.790
 where the stop thread is between the 

00:00:39.690 --> 00:00:44.510
 first and fourth needle is the 

00:00:41.790 --> 00:00:49.200
 drive stop 

00:00:44.510 --> 00:00:52.379
 I knit once over the fourth and 

00:00:49.200 --> 00:00:54.329
 over the first needle over it the second 

00:00:52.379 --> 00:00:56.219
 Third trading was absolutely out of the question 

00:00:54.329 --> 00:00:56.760
 We do not need eight of them for a while now 

00:00:56.219 --> 00:00:59.309
 more 

00:00:56.760 --> 00:01:03.620
 i do it all on a needle i 

00:00:59.309 --> 00:01:03.620
 take out the first needle 

00:01:12.080 --> 00:01:17.580
 if you have all the rights over him 

00:01:14.190 --> 00:01:20.330
 knitted with needle then turned the 

00:01:17.580 --> 00:01:20.330
 knit around 

00:01:20.380 --> 00:01:25.020
 and picks up the first stitch 

00:01:28.430 --> 00:01:33.500
 then you stretch 2 

00:01:31.350 --> 00:01:33.500
 Nothing 

00:01:35.870 --> 00:01:41.900
 and until the last three stitches 

00:01:38.710 --> 00:01:44.140
 Strict left stitches quickly stress up 

00:01:41.900 --> 00:01:44.140
 fast 

00:01:48.760 --> 00:01:53.140
 the last three stitches as strict 

00:01:51.910 --> 00:01:57.660
 right stitches 

00:01:53.140 --> 00:01:57.660
 then it turned around again 

00:01:58.450 --> 00:02:01.920
 the first half off 

00:02:03.080 --> 00:02:09.500
 and the rest wears the right stitch 

00:02:06.230 --> 00:02:12.230
 that's what you do that a few times 

00:02:09.500 --> 00:02:14.810
 depends on how many machines have if 

00:02:12.230 --> 00:02:17.000
 their women worried now have 14 

00:02:14.810 --> 00:02:20.480
 mesh on a needle then you have to 

00:02:17.000 --> 00:02:24.680
 knit a total of 28 rhine high 

00:02:20.480 --> 00:02:28.520
 that means that they have 14 of them 

00:02:24.680 --> 00:02:31.310
 I have little ribs on the side 

00:02:28.520 --> 00:02:33.470
 count it generally still pure but 

00:02:31.310 --> 00:02:35.900
 only after hip because of the 

00:02:33.470 --> 00:02:39.950
 it's just a lot easier to rip 

00:02:35.900 --> 00:02:43.940
 So 14 mesh means 14 ribs 15 

00:02:39.950 --> 00:02:46.130
 mesh means 15 such ribs 

00:02:43.940 --> 00:02:48.760
 for example, now are one two three 

00:02:46.130 --> 00:02:51.709
 four five six seven ribs 

00:02:48.760 --> 00:02:54.590
 that would be the whole rock wall 

00:02:51.709 --> 00:02:57.560
 In the next part I will show you 

00:02:54.590 --> 00:03:00.950
 how he can knit the heel cap 

00:02:57.560 --> 00:03:02.900
 that 's a bit more complicated when you do it 

00:03:00.950 --> 00:03:05.480
 just written but when you see it 

00:03:02.900 --> 00:03:08.780
 look then it is very easy 

00:03:05.480 --> 00:03:11.630
 I hope we'll see you in part 3 

00:03:08.780 --> 00:03:14.440
 again and I wish you a knit 

00:03:11.630 --> 00:03:14.440
 full day
