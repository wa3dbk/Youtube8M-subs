00:01:03.600 --> 00:01:08.009
 a golden boy I start immediately as 

00:01:05.729 --> 00:01:09.990
 usually putting a primer on the whole 

00:01:08.009 --> 00:01:13.170
 mobile eyelid and also under the arch 

00:01:09.990 --> 00:01:15.090
 obviously eyebrows immediately afterwards 

00:01:13.170 --> 00:01:17.100
 I'm going to get this pastel pencil 

00:01:15.090 --> 00:01:19.830
 heaven than the new collection 

00:01:17.100 --> 00:01:23.520
 snow collection and how you see a 

00:01:19.830 --> 00:01:25.229
 beautiful light blue very writing la 

00:01:23.520 --> 00:01:27.030
 very soft pencil and I go to 

00:01:25.229 --> 00:01:30.659
 apply it to the end of the eyelid 

00:01:27.030 --> 00:01:32.970
 mobile and also above the fold 

00:01:30.659 --> 00:01:36.770
 of the eye and I'm going to do one 

00:01:32.970 --> 00:01:39.240
 vik's subspecies after I go to fade 

00:01:36.770 --> 00:01:41.460
 this really very soft pencils 

00:01:39.240 --> 00:01:43.289
 so you will be able to blend it very well 

00:01:41.460 --> 00:01:46.319
 even with the only companies I have 

00:01:43.289 --> 00:01:47.940
 made with this small brush here and that of 

00:01:46.319 --> 00:01:51.509
 I don't usually know but a lot then 

00:01:47.940 --> 00:01:53.090
 went quiet and then applied ritual 

00:01:51.509 --> 00:01:56.549
 meanwhile put some scotch for 

00:01:53.090 --> 00:01:58.440
 to expedite briko ritual above both 

00:01:56.549 --> 00:02:01.229
 the blue pencil part as you see that 

00:01:58.440 --> 00:02:03.990
 I'm doing so now that I have 

00:02:01.229 --> 00:02:07.310
 darkened the purple a little and then applied it 

00:02:03.990 --> 00:02:09.690
 up to the end the three quarters of an eye 

00:02:07.310 --> 00:02:11.940
 practically so as to have on the end 

00:02:09.690 --> 00:02:13.829
 where there was blue a darker purple e 

00:02:11.940 --> 00:02:15.450
 in the rest from the eye a violet a 

00:02:13.829 --> 00:02:19.320
 a little lighter without giving effect 

00:02:15.450 --> 00:02:23.670
 too dark of black so now I take 

00:02:19.320 --> 00:02:27.060
 this blush of the new collection and it 

00:02:23.670 --> 00:02:29.400
 I apply as an eye shadow even if it is not a 

00:02:27.060 --> 00:02:30.959
 eye shadow but in the same color color 

00:02:29.400 --> 00:02:32.970
 there's nothing left to do 

00:02:30.959 --> 00:02:34.890
 the obligation on the fold of the eye like 

00:02:32.970 --> 00:02:36.720
 eye shadow for my shade and I have to 

00:02:34.890 --> 00:02:39.980
 say that this color with purple if 

00:02:36.720 --> 00:02:39.980
 honestly very well indeed 

00:02:42.480 --> 00:02:49.240
 I take peyote that this beautiful 

00:02:45.330 --> 00:02:52.350
 white with lime green reflections 

00:02:49.240 --> 00:02:56.980
 it is truly spectacular and I apply it 

00:02:52.350 --> 00:02:59.230
 on the part I left free of di 

00:02:56.980 --> 00:03:01.690
 eyelid from the eye shadow in short is like 

00:02:59.230 --> 00:03:04.450
 see above the violet then from an effect 

00:03:01.690 --> 00:03:07.360
 hyper pearlescent us out just the 

00:03:04.450 --> 00:03:09.430
 green over a dark color and I like it 

00:03:07.360 --> 00:03:12.670
 a very gradual effect that e 

00:03:09.430 --> 00:03:15.070
 especially the effect of line reflections 

00:03:12.670 --> 00:03:17.170
 it's really amazing and I'm going to fade it 

00:03:15.070 --> 00:03:19.120
 well then under the eyebrows race 

00:03:17.170 --> 00:03:20.770
 eyebrows as perrotta has 

00:03:19.120 --> 00:03:23.920
 really for the sciences too 

00:03:20.770 --> 00:03:27.600
 strong and too much came to apply 

00:03:23.920 --> 00:03:30.940
 anti quite of nabla than an opaque white 

00:03:27.600 --> 00:03:33.130
 then I take the crayon ground pencil that 

00:03:30.940 --> 00:03:34.620
 is always that of the new collection e 

00:03:33.130 --> 00:03:37.870
 the African on the inner rim of the eye 

00:03:34.620 --> 00:03:40.240
 but this brown is very nice and does it 

00:03:37.870 --> 00:03:43.330
 stand out was the blue of my lenses 

00:03:40.240 --> 00:03:45.910
 both green and maybe some 

00:03:43.330 --> 00:03:48.060
 brown eye then this pencil less 

00:03:45.910 --> 00:03:50.830
 gives us a lot and I have to say that it lasts that 

00:03:48.060 --> 00:03:54.720
 despite being very soft it lasted 

00:03:50.830 --> 00:03:54.720
 a lot even after doing the trick 

00:04:05.299 --> 00:04:09.450
 now I go to the sea just the pencil 

00:04:07.680 --> 00:04:11.069
 which is so soft that one is enough 

00:04:09.450 --> 00:04:14.129
 brush but also with a cotton swab 

00:04:11.069 --> 00:04:17.699
 if you want and fades like this without staying 

00:04:14.129 --> 00:04:19.739
 too careful and then I'm going to apply 

00:04:17.699 --> 00:04:21.449
 eyeliner in this case used the 

00:04:19.739 --> 00:04:23.460
 raiders commitment of walls that why 

00:04:21.449 --> 00:04:25.979
 really spectacular I love it 

00:04:23.460 --> 00:04:29.400
 as an eyeliner and I'm going to make a line 

00:04:25.979 --> 00:04:32.190
 quite thin though I go anyway 

00:04:29.400 --> 00:04:35.130
 to make my classic little corner 

00:04:32.190 --> 00:04:38.090
 inside the eye and after there 

00:04:35.130 --> 00:04:42.570
 I also define a little cole niner 

00:04:38.090 --> 00:04:44.190
 the lower infra rhyme is not here 

00:04:42.570 --> 00:04:45.960
 it didn't look good in the video but then 

00:04:44.190 --> 00:04:48.260
 I do see that there is precisely 

00:04:45.960 --> 00:04:50.820
 eyelash peeler a little darker 

00:04:48.260 --> 00:04:53.639
 now I apply mascara and always use 

00:04:50.820 --> 00:04:55.440
 this of essence is that I love and it is not 

00:04:53.639 --> 00:04:57.150
 never pruned because so much then I go 

00:04:55.440 --> 00:04:59.160
 apply false eyelashes so there is no 

00:04:57.150 --> 00:05:00.660
 need to load ours too much 

00:04:59.160 --> 00:05:02.220
 natural mascara when we give to 

00:05:00.660 --> 00:05:04.680
 put low 

00:05:02.220 --> 00:05:06.180
 just a little to darken to not make in 

00:05:04.680 --> 00:05:09.150
 so that the can from the difference 

00:05:06.180 --> 00:05:11.580
 with the fake ones here I am of 

00:05:09.150 --> 00:05:13.080
 tweezers and glue and I go to apply the 

00:05:11.580 --> 00:05:17.039
 fake eyelashes so you see too 

00:05:13.080 --> 00:05:18.389
 application I wait 30 35 seconds 

00:05:17.039 --> 00:05:20.550
 that the glue will dry and then when 

00:05:18.389 --> 00:05:23.669
 simply to place them on top of them 

00:05:20.550 --> 00:05:25.650
 natural media that a bit of practice 

00:05:23.669 --> 00:05:28.500
 you will see that this step will become 

00:05:25.650 --> 00:05:30.240
 very fast then I apply hybrid itself 

00:05:28.500 --> 00:05:32.940
 blasco also applied on the lock 

00:05:30.240 --> 00:05:35.760
 the obligation on the cheeks as you see a 

00:05:32.940 --> 00:05:38.289
 very beautiful natural color from own 

00:05:35.760 --> 00:05:40.479
 a healthy facial effect 

00:05:38.289 --> 00:05:42.219
 now I'm going to apply the illuminant if 

00:05:40.479 --> 00:05:44.649
 you haven't seen it I've uploaded the 

00:05:42.219 --> 00:05:46.599
 tutorial some time ago and then 

00:05:44.649 --> 00:05:47.979
 go and see why I assure you that 

00:05:46.599 --> 00:05:50.710
 the enlightened ones I do is 

00:05:47.979 --> 00:05:52.210
 spectacular and then I'm going to apply 

00:05:50.710 --> 00:05:54.969
 this pencil always of snow for 

00:05:52.210 --> 00:05:58.649
 stay on topic that is marmot like that 

00:05:54.969 --> 00:06:01.749
 you know is my news lip pencil 

00:05:58.649 --> 00:06:04.270
 absolute favorite and I go to 

00:06:01.749 --> 00:06:06.659
 simply to outline and to fill the 

00:06:04.270 --> 00:06:06.659
 lips 

00:06:08.349 --> 00:06:12.430
 now I'm going to redefine it a bit with a 

00:06:09.939 --> 00:06:15.550
 pinch concealer brush so 

00:06:12.430 --> 00:06:18.759
 to have definite lips and this was it 

00:06:15.550 --> 00:06:20.259
 also a sense of volume and nothing 

00:06:18.759 --> 00:06:22.839
 trick is over I hope you like it 

00:06:20.259 --> 00:06:26.459
 I send you a big kiss and let me know 

00:06:22.839 --> 00:06:26.459
