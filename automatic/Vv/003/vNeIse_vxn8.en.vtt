00:01:19.280 --> 00:01:19.290 
side sticks out but the other doesn't

00:01:19.290 --> 00:01:22.190

00:01:32.640 --> 00:01:34.580 
could do that you could put a crafting
table<00:01:32.670> let's<00:01:33.570> see<00:01:33.720> some<00:01:33.900> other<00:01:34.020> options<00:01:34.229> you

00:01:34.580 --> 00:01:34.590 
table let's see some other options you

00:01:34.590 --> 00:01:36.980 
table let's see some other options you
could<00:01:34.799> put<00:01:35.100> some<00:01:35.340> butter<00:01:35.790> you<00:01:36.540> could<00:01:36.750> put<00:01:36.930> a

00:01:36.980 --> 00:01:36.990 
could put some butter you could put a

00:01:36.990 --> 00:01:38.780 
could put some butter you could put a
cauldron<00:01:37.439> on<00:01:37.560> top<00:01:37.799> of<00:01:38.009> it<00:01:38.100> I<00:01:38.220> think<00:01:38.280> the<00:01:38.520> cold

00:01:38.780 --> 00:01:38.790 
cauldron on top of it I think the cold

00:01:38.790 --> 00:01:40.190 
cauldron on top of it I think the cold
room<00:01:38.909> looks<00:01:39.180> kind<00:01:39.509> of<00:01:39.570> cool<00:01:39.750> because<00:01:39.900> you<00:01:40.170> can

00:01:40.190 --> 00:01:40.200 
room looks kind of cool because you can

00:01:40.200 --> 00:01:43.280 
room looks kind of cool because you can
see<00:01:40.619> that<00:01:40.890> it<00:01:41.490> is<00:01:41.759> sort<00:01:42.390> of<00:01:42.479> is<00:01:42.600> there<00:01:42.840> but<00:01:43.079> that

00:01:43.280 --> 00:01:43.290 
see that it is sort of is there but that

00:01:43.290 --> 00:01:45.200 
see that it is sort of is there but that
defeats<00:01:43.740> the<00:01:43.920> purpose<00:01:44.310> of<00:01:44.579> it<00:01:44.729> being<00:01:44.880> hidden

00:01:45.200 --> 00:01:45.210 
defeats the purpose of it being hidden

00:01:45.210 --> 00:01:47.330 
defeats the purpose of it being hidden
you<00:01:45.659> could<00:01:45.840> put<00:01:46.020> a<00:01:46.079> recipe<00:01:46.680> book<00:01:46.710> even<00:01:47.189> though

00:01:47.330 --> 00:01:47.340 
you could put a recipe book even though

00:01:47.340 --> 00:01:49.850 
you could put a recipe book even though
this<00:01:47.549> was<00:01:47.820> a<00:01:47.850> MJ<00:01:48.299> per<00:01:48.360> table<00:01:48.869> but<00:01:49.049> you<00:01:49.170> know<00:01:49.320> you

00:01:49.850 --> 00:01:49.860 
this was a MJ per table but you know you

00:01:49.860 --> 00:01:51.350 
this was a MJ per table but you know you
want<00:01:50.040> to<00:01:50.070> get<00:01:50.189> your<00:01:50.369> grub<00:01:50.640> on<00:01:50.790> like<00:01:51.090> your

your Martha Stewart yeah that's the very

00:02:02.820 --> 00:02:04.490 
your Martha Stewart yeah that's the very
first<00:02:02.909> design<00:02:03.390> it's<00:02:03.570> fairly<00:02:03.840> simple<00:02:04.140> now<00:02:04.439> the

00:02:04.490 --> 00:02:04.500 
first design it's fairly simple now the

00:02:04.500 --> 00:02:06.770 
first design it's fairly simple now the
second<00:02:04.920> one<00:02:05.009> is<00:02:05.189> a<00:02:05.219> bit<00:02:05.820> more<00:02:05.969> complicated<00:02:06.390> but

00:02:06.770 --> 00:02:06.780 
second one is a bit more complicated but

00:02:06.780 --> 00:02:08.270 
second one is a bit more complicated but
it's<00:02:06.960> not<00:02:07.200> as<00:02:07.350> hard<00:02:07.619> you're<00:02:07.890> going<00:02:08.009> to<00:02:08.099> want<00:02:08.220> to

00:02:08.270 --> 00:02:08.280 
it's not as hard you're going to want to

00:02:08.280 --> 00:02:10.550 
it's not as hard you're going to want to
build<00:02:08.459> up<00:02:08.580> two<00:02:08.819> blocks<00:02:08.970> high<00:02:09.270> and<00:02:09.629> pretty<00:02:10.500> much

00:02:10.550 --> 00:02:10.560 
build up two blocks high and pretty much

00:02:10.560 --> 00:02:12.380 
build up two blocks high and pretty much
just<00:02:10.800> go<00:02:11.009> in<00:02:11.220> a<00:02:11.310> direction<00:02:11.520> like<00:02:11.819> this<00:02:12.000> so<00:02:12.330> two

00:02:12.380 --> 00:02:12.390 
just go in a direction like this so two

00:02:12.390 --> 00:02:13.700 
just go in a direction like this so two
blocks<00:02:12.840> high

00:02:13.700 --> 00:02:13.710 
blocks high

00:02:13.710 --> 00:02:16.310 
blocks high
two<00:02:14.550> blocks<00:02:14.790> high<00:02:15.030> and<00:02:15.390> that's<00:02:15.870> pretty<00:02:16.170> much

00:02:16.310 --> 00:02:16.320 
two blocks high and that's pretty much

00:02:16.320 --> 00:02:17.900 
two blocks high and that's pretty much
what<00:02:16.620> the<00:02:16.830> frame<00:02:17.130> of<00:02:17.310> it's<00:02:17.460> going<00:02:17.640> to<00:02:17.700> be<00:02:17.790> like

00:02:17.900 --> 00:02:17.910 
what the frame of it's going to be like

00:02:17.910 --> 00:02:19.520 
what the frame of it's going to be like
but<00:02:18.330> whatever<00:02:18.540> block<00:02:18.930> you're<00:02:19.080> building<00:02:19.410> out

00:02:19.520 --> 00:02:19.530 
but whatever block you're building out

furnaces on either side and there we go

00:02:41.520 --> 00:02:43.850 
furnaces on either side and there we go
we<00:02:41.730> are<00:02:41.760> we<00:02:42.090> can<00:02:42.240> hide<00:02:42.390> it<00:02:42.510> like<00:02:42.540> that<00:02:42.960> we<00:02:43.740> can

00:02:43.850 --> 00:02:43.860 
we are we can hide it like that we can

00:02:43.860 --> 00:02:45.560 
we are we can hide it like that we can
also<00:02:43.980> do<00:02:44.250> stuff<00:02:44.490> like<00:02:44.580> this<00:02:44.670> put<00:02:45.090> some<00:02:45.240> butter

00:02:45.560 --> 00:02:45.570 
also do stuff like this put some butter

00:02:45.570 --> 00:02:47.540 
also do stuff like this put some butter
on<00:02:45.720> top<00:02:46.050> of<00:02:46.290> it<00:02:46.410> a<00:02:46.530> cold<00:02:46.770> room<00:02:46.890> on<00:02:47.040> top<00:02:47.190> of<00:02:47.370> that

00:02:47.540 --> 00:02:47.550 
on top of it a cold room on top of that

00:02:47.550 --> 00:02:49.190 
on top of it a cold room on top of that
the<00:02:47.880> reason<00:02:48.180> why<00:02:48.300> I<00:02:48.330> say<00:02:48.540> the<00:02:48.660> cauldron<00:02:49.020> right

00:02:49.190 --> 00:02:49.200 
the reason why I say the cauldron right

00:02:49.200 --> 00:02:50.810 
the reason why I say the cauldron right
here<00:02:49.410> is<00:02:49.500> because<00:02:49.710> I<00:02:49.950> thought<00:02:50.130> I<00:02:50.370> think<00:02:50.700> this

00:02:50.810 --> 00:02:50.820 
here is because I thought I think this

00:02:50.820 --> 00:02:53.270 
here is because I thought I think this
is<00:02:50.880> actually<00:02:51.090> pretty<00:02:51.480> cool<00:02:51.690> if<00:02:51.990> you<00:02:52.620> make<00:02:53.100> your

00:02:53.270 --> 00:02:53.280 
is actually pretty cool if you make your

00:02:53.280 --> 00:02:56.420 
is actually pretty cool if you make your
house<00:02:53.460> like<00:02:53.700> this<00:02:54.650> you<00:02:55.650> can<00:02:55.860> see<00:02:56.040> that<00:02:56.250> right

00:02:56.420 --> 00:02:56.430 
house like this you can see that right

00:02:56.430 --> 00:02:58.280 
house like this you can see that right
there<00:02:56.490> so<00:02:56.910> I<00:02:56.970> think<00:02:57.210> that's<00:02:57.390> kind<00:02:57.750> of<00:02:57.780> cool<00:02:57.990> you

00:02:58.280 --> 00:02:58.290 
there so I think that's kind of cool you

00:02:58.290 --> 00:03:00.890 
there so I think that's kind of cool you
