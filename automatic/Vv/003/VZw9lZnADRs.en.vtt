00:00:00.910 --> 00:00:05.020
 I play youtube people today I'm here in 

00:00:03.280 --> 00:00:07.440
 the third episode of testing rhesus 

00:00:05.020 --> 00:00:11.110
 pack this time I'm going to show you 

00:00:07.440 --> 00:00:14.889
 This turns out to be called a 3 full TV 

00:00:11.110 --> 00:00:18.490
 edit that was created by a 3 and is 

00:00:14.889 --> 00:00:20.949
 moderator and very good players us etc and 

00:00:18.490 --> 00:00:25.230
 good this rhesus for is already enough 

00:00:20.949 --> 00:00:27.630
 famous that you already know him 

00:00:25.230 --> 00:00:30.900
 and good as all the result say what 

00:00:27.630 --> 00:00:32.960
 good and bad this result the only thing 

00:00:30.900 --> 00:00:35.430
 bad that has good for me 

00:00:32.960 --> 00:00:37.570
 personally for me it is the 

00:00:35.430 --> 00:00:41.230
 particles that 

00:00:37.570 --> 00:00:44.620
 they are not very changed in fact they are like 

00:00:41.230 --> 00:00:47.800
 those of the facebook the text so that 

00:00:44.620 --> 00:00:48.790
 they all use for their rival but that's what 

00:00:47.800 --> 00:00:50.470
 only 

00:00:48.790 --> 00:00:52.960
 If you like those particles, 

00:00:50.470 --> 00:00:56.730
 It has nothing bad and good because everything 

00:00:52.960 --> 00:00:56.730
 it does not cause you almost anything 

00:00:59.710 --> 00:01:07.400
 but it feels nothing and nothing of 

00:01:02.469 --> 00:01:09.680
 It also has the clean inventory 

00:01:07.400 --> 00:01:12.190
 what everyone who is clean the 

00:01:09.680 --> 00:01:12.190
 Inventory 

00:01:12.870 --> 00:01:19.080
 and that is a point in favor since 

00:01:16.520 --> 00:01:22.290
 or it is appreciated that he 

00:01:19.080 --> 00:01:24.930
 he happens to have what is the guide 

00:01:22.290 --> 00:01:26.420
 clean and vain let's start these are the 

00:01:24.930 --> 00:01:29.020
 blocks 

00:01:26.420 --> 00:01:31.060
 all these are not 

00:01:29.020 --> 00:01:34.359
 I think nothing has changed to the faifi these 

00:01:31.060 --> 00:01:38.280
 they are what is the trees the water so 

00:01:34.359 --> 00:01:40.710
 go and when you get in it looks a bit unclear 

00:01:38.280 --> 00:01:44.580
 and the animation of the fire is very 

00:01:40.710 --> 00:01:47.880
 reduced which is fine for in case 

00:01:44.580 --> 00:01:52.080
 of pepe so the fire is seen and here they are 

00:01:47.880 --> 00:01:54.360
 some villagers mobs and all that 

00:01:52.080 --> 00:01:58.650
 and we started to see it then the important thing 

00:01:54.360 --> 00:02:02.340
 which are the envelopes some envelopes here 

00:01:58.650 --> 00:02:04.500
 there are some objects that they possess 

00:02:02.340 --> 00:02:08.100
 many servers 

00:02:04.500 --> 00:02:11.370
 here are the swords which is something that 

00:02:08.100 --> 00:02:12.930
 I really like this one, it turns out that they are 

00:02:11.370 --> 00:02:16.200
 very thin and does not cover much 

00:02:12.930 --> 00:02:17.760
 vision then of the screen that as I say 

00:02:16.200 --> 00:02:19.010
 the particles are almost unchanged 

00:02:17.760 --> 00:02:21.910
 as you can see 

00:02:19.010 --> 00:02:24.870
 the particles 

00:02:21.910 --> 00:02:27.770
 and the critics are like that 

00:02:24.870 --> 00:02:30.640
 they are not changed that the only bad thing 

00:02:27.770 --> 00:02:33.800
 but already happening that he 

00:02:30.640 --> 00:02:36.860
 this result is perfect 

00:02:33.800 --> 00:02:38.960
 and the animation of the arch because it looks 

00:02:36.860 --> 00:02:40.850
 the recharge 

00:02:38.960 --> 00:02:44.460
 and here is the andrew bell that is 

00:02:40.850 --> 00:02:48.450
 normality here is the armor 

00:02:44.460 --> 00:02:51.590
 the play chair is normal 

00:02:48.450 --> 00:02:53.989
 and here are all the tools 

00:02:51.590 --> 00:02:57.250
 here are the positions that these 

00:02:53.989 --> 00:02:57.250
 we made and change the particles 

00:02:58.100 --> 00:03:04.849
 and here are the position 

00:03:02.540 --> 00:03:08.930
 and these are the weak ones that are 

00:03:04.849 --> 00:03:12.010
 same as the iphone's and this is the 

00:03:08.930 --> 00:03:14.810
 food that is also not changed but 

00:03:12.010 --> 00:03:17.989
 in general this turns out to be very very 

00:03:14.810 --> 00:03:20.269
 well now I say it with a gameplay that 

00:03:17.989 --> 00:03:24.590
 record a server that I'm just 

00:03:20.269 --> 00:03:26.750
 starting to play there almost and well no 

00:03:24.590 --> 00:03:30.450
 can accumulate gusts of more than 10 

00:03:26.750 --> 00:03:32.580
 because apart from that there are many teams 

00:03:30.450 --> 00:03:35.040
 I break the gun not very fast I do not know 

00:03:32.580 --> 00:03:37.019
 why and I do not know how to repair it but the 

00:03:35.040 --> 00:03:41.030
 always and I hope you like it and not 

00:03:37.019 --> 00:03:41.030
 way the next chapter god 

00:04:12.530 --> 00:04:16.270
 that is 

00:04:18.650 --> 00:04:25.580
 for this 

00:04:21.439 --> 00:04:25.580
 I feel that I am 

00:04:34.460 --> 00:04:38.500
 we see all 

00:04:36.990 --> 00:04:41.370
 A) Yes 

00:04:38.500 --> 00:04:41.370
 all right 

00:05:12.729 --> 00:05:14.879
 and 

00:05:32.449 --> 00:05:36.879
 and it is where there is the same 

00:05:37.400 --> 00:05:43.610
 that 's why it 's good 

00:05:44.400 --> 00:05:46.910
 yes 

00:05:48.980 --> 00:05:52.280
 and here 

00:05:53.200 --> 00:05:57.340
 of all 

00:05:55.560 --> 00:06:00.340
 mine 

00:05:57.340 --> 00:06:00.340
 they opened 

00:06:08.480 --> 00:06:11.480
 now 

00:06:15.759 --> 00:06:18.759
 t 

00:06:31.940 --> 00:06:37.500
 and this reality 

00:06:34.330 --> 00:06:37.500
 It hurts 

00:06:50.120 --> 00:06:55.820
 and a lot 

00:06:59.800 --> 00:07:02.800
 Y 

00:07:09.169 --> 00:07:12.169
 Y 

00:07:15.759 --> 00:07:21.130
 ah 

00:07:18.350 --> 00:07:21.130
 now 

00:07:23.770 --> 00:07:26.729
 or not
