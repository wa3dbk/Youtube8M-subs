beat<00:00:48.140> and<00:00:48.350> rhythm<00:00:48.590> are<00:00:48.830> two<00:00:49.040> words<00:00:49.310> that<00:00:49.490> are

00:00:49.570 --> 00:00:49.580 
beat and rhythm are two words that are

00:00:49.580 --> 00:00:51.790 
beat and rhythm are two words that are
often<00:00:50.000> used<00:00:50.030> synonymously<00:00:50.480> and<00:00:51.350> though

00:00:51.790 --> 00:00:51.800 
often used synonymously and though

they're closely related they do mean

00:00:53.270 --> 00:00:53.890 
they're closely related they do mean
different<00:00:53.570> things

00:00:53.890 --> 00:00:53.900 
different things

00:00:53.900 --> 00:00:55.840 
different things
so<00:00:54.470> before<00:00:54.770> we<00:00:54.860> can<00:00:54.950> move<00:00:55.100> forward<00:00:55.160> you<00:00:55.700> have

00:00:55.840 --> 00:00:55.850 
so before we can move forward you have

00:00:55.850 --> 00:01:01.100 
so before we can move forward you have
to<00:00:55.970> understand<00:00:56.420> that<00:00:56.540> difference

00:01:01.100 --> 00:01:01.110 

00:01:01.110 --> 00:01:04.290 

the<00:01:02.110> beat<00:01:02.350> is<00:01:02.560> a<00:01:02.590> constant<00:01:03.340> even<00:01:03.910> an

00:01:04.290 --> 00:01:04.300 
the beat is a constant even an

00:01:04.300 --> 00:01:06.330 
the beat is a constant even an

someone counting one two three four or

00:01:16.360 --> 00:01:18.510 
someone counting one two three four or
maybe<00:01:16.750> even<00:01:16.840> a<00:01:17.170> drummer<00:01:17.500> clicking<00:01:18.160> it<00:01:18.280> sticks

to the same amount and that beat that

00:01:20.920 --> 00:01:22.140 
to the same amount and that beat that
they<00:01:21.100> provide<00:01:21.430> the<00:01:21.610> beginning<00:01:21.850> of<00:01:21.910> a<00:01:21.970> song

00:01:22.140 --> 00:01:22.150 
they provide the beginning of a song

00:01:22.150 --> 00:01:24.570 
they provide the beginning of a song
continues<00:01:22.810> throughout<00:01:23.110> the<00:01:23.290> song<00:01:23.530> and<00:01:23.950> give

00:01:24.570 --> 00:01:24.580 
continues throughout the song and give

00:01:24.580 --> 00:01:26.460 
continues throughout the song and give
structure<00:01:24.880> to<00:01:25.030> all<00:01:25.270> that<00:01:25.479> follows<00:01:25.840> let<00:01:26.380> me

structure to all that follows let me

00:01:26.470 --> 00:01:27.660 
structure to all that follows let me
give<00:01:26.590> you<00:01:26.680> an<00:01:26.740> example<00:01:27.040> that<00:01:27.190> might<00:01:27.430> make<00:01:27.580> this

00:01:27.660 --> 00:01:27.670 
give you an example that might make this

00:01:27.670 --> 00:01:29.040 
give you an example that might make this
a<00:01:27.729> bit<00:01:27.970> clearer<00:01:28.330> if<00:01:28.510> I<00:01:28.570> play<00:01:28.750> something<00:01:28.930> like

00:01:29.040 --> 00:01:29.050 
a bit clearer if I play something like

00:01:29.050 --> 00:01:40.680 
a bit clearer if I play something like
this<00:01:29.380> 1<00:01:30.040> 2<00:01:30.580> 3<00:01:30.900> 4<00:01:31.900> 1<00:01:32.590> 2<00:01:33.220> 3<00:01:33.479> 4<00:01:34.479> 1<00:01:35.259> 2<00:01:35.640> 3<00:01:36.640> or<00:01:39.690> those

this 1 2 3 4 1 2 3 4 1 2 3 or those

00:01:40.690 --> 00:01:42.810 
this 1 2 3 4 1 2 3 4 1 2 3 or those
spaces<00:01:41.110> perhaps<00:01:41.950> give<00:01:42.220> you<00:01:42.310> a<00:01:42.340> little<00:01:42.580> greater

00:01:42.810 --> 00:01:42.820 
spaces perhaps give you a little greater

00:01:42.820 --> 00:01:44.670 
spaces perhaps give you a little greater
insight<00:01:43.270> into<00:01:43.300> what<00:01:43.690> the<00:01:43.810> beat<00:01:43.990> actually<00:01:44.500> is

00:01:44.670 --> 00:01:44.680 
insight into what the beat actually is

00:01:44.680 --> 00:01:45.990 
insight into what the beat actually is
because<00:01:45.190> even<00:01:45.490> if<00:01:45.580> I'm<00:01:45.670> not<00:01:45.790> playing

00:01:45.990 --> 00:01:46.000 
because even if I'm not playing

00:01:46.000 --> 00:01:48.840 
because even if I'm not playing
something<00:01:46.600> the<00:01:47.050> beat<00:01:47.290> is<00:01:47.470> still<00:01:47.920> there<00:01:48.220> giving

00:01:48.840 --> 00:01:48.850 
something the beat is still there giving

00:01:48.850 --> 00:01:50.160 
something the beat is still there giving
structure<00:01:49.180> to<00:01:49.420> everything<00:01:49.750> that's<00:01:49.899> played

00:01:50.160 --> 00:01:50.170 
structure to everything that's played

00:01:50.170 --> 00:01:52.710 
structure to everything that's played
over<00:01:50.710> it<00:01:50.830> perhaps<00:01:51.759> the<00:01:52.270> way<00:01:52.390> you<00:01:52.450> should<00:01:52.570> start

00:01:52.710 --> 00:01:52.720 
over it perhaps the way you should start

00:01:52.720 --> 00:01:54.330 
over it perhaps the way you should start
to<00:01:52.810> think<00:01:52.930> of<00:01:52.960> a<00:01:53.050> beat<00:01:53.229> is<00:01:53.410> that<00:01:53.590> a<00:01:53.619> beat<00:01:53.920> is<00:01:54.100> not

00:01:54.330 --> 00:01:54.340 
to think of a beat is that a beat is not

00:01:54.340 --> 00:01:55.680 
to think of a beat is that a beat is not
something<00:01:54.790> you<00:01:54.910> play<00:01:55.240> but<00:01:55.450> it's<00:01:55.570> something

00:01:55.680 --> 00:01:55.690 
something you play but it's something

00:01:55.690 --> 00:01:58.260 
something you play but it's something
that<00:01:55.840> you<00:01:56.110> feel<00:01:56.560> that<00:01:57.130> should<00:01:57.340> inspire<00:01:57.820> what

00:01:58.260 --> 00:01:58.270 
that you feel that should inspire what

00:01:58.270 --> 00:02:02.100 
that you feel that should inspire what
you<00:01:58.390> play<00:01:58.740> as<00:02:00.330> a<00:02:01.330> beginner<00:02:01.720> you<00:02:01.780> may<00:02:01.960> have<00:02:02.080> a

00:02:02.100 --> 00:02:02.110 
you play as a beginner you may have a

00:02:02.110 --> 00:02:04.139 
you play as a beginner you may have a
difficult<00:02:02.380> time<00:02:02.830> trying<00:02:03.460> to<00:02:03.610> keep<00:02:03.789> the<00:02:03.970> beat

00:02:04.139 --> 00:02:04.149 
difficult time trying to keep the beat

00:02:04.149 --> 00:02:05.730 
difficult time trying to keep the beat
steady<00:02:04.510> or<00:02:05.080> you<00:02:05.170> might<00:02:05.290> even<00:02:05.380> think<00:02:05.650> you're

00:02:05.730 --> 00:02:05.740 
steady or you might even think you're

00:02:05.740 --> 00:02:07.109 
steady or you might even think you're
doing<00:02:05.890> a<00:02:05.920> good<00:02:06.040> job<00:02:06.100> giving<00:02:06.610> it<00:02:06.700> steady<00:02:06.909> when

00:02:07.109 --> 00:02:07.119 
doing a good job giving it steady when

00:02:07.119 --> 00:02:08.969 
doing a good job giving it steady when
you<00:02:07.180> might<00:02:07.330> be<00:02:07.360> way<00:02:07.630> off<00:02:07.679> so<00:02:08.679> we're<00:02:08.769> going<00:02:08.890> to

00:02:08.969 --> 00:02:08.979 
you might be way off so we're going to

00:02:08.979 --> 00:02:10.620 
you might be way off so we're going to
do<00:02:09.130> something<00:02:09.369> to<00:02:09.610> make<00:02:09.760> the<00:02:09.880> beat<00:02:10.060> a<00:02:10.090> bit<00:02:10.390> more

00:02:10.620 --> 00:02:10.630 
do something to make the beat a bit more

00:02:10.630 --> 00:02:12.210 
do something to make the beat a bit more
obvious<00:02:10.780> going<00:02:11.590> to<00:02:11.709> give<00:02:11.860> you<00:02:11.980> something

00:02:12.210 --> 00:02:12.220 
obvious going to give you something

obvious going to give you something
that's<00:02:12.430> going<00:02:12.549> to<00:02:12.670> play<00:02:12.940> over<00:02:12.970> the<00:02:13.450> beat<00:02:13.630> we

00:02:14.130 --> 00:02:14.140 
that's going to play over the beat we

00:02:14.140 --> 00:02:17.220 
that's going to play over the beat we

one<00:02:17.350> I'm<00:02:17.440> going<00:02:17.500> to<00:02:17.680> provide<00:02:17.890> you<00:02:18.040> with<00:02:18.250> sound

00:02:18.539 --> 00:02:18.549 
one I'm going to provide you with sound

00:02:18.549 --> 00:02:22.940 
one I'm going to provide you with sound
something<00:02:18.820> like<00:02:18.850> this

00:02:22.940 --> 00:02:22.950 

00:02:22.950 --> 00:02:25.920 

so<00:02:23.950> try<00:02:24.610> to<00:02:24.670> use<00:02:24.850> this<00:02:25.030> metronome<00:02:25.510> to<00:02:25.690> guide

00:02:25.920 --> 00:02:25.930 
so try to use this metronome to guide

00:02:25.930 --> 00:02:27.840 
so try to use this metronome to guide
your<00:02:26.170> sense<00:02:26.440> of<00:02:26.560> the<00:02:26.709> beat<00:02:26.890> and<00:02:27.100> keep<00:02:27.700> you

00:02:27.840 --> 00:02:27.850 
your sense of the beat and keep you

00:02:27.850 --> 00:02:29.370 
your sense of the beat and keep you
steady<00:02:28.090> you<00:02:28.360> can<00:02:28.450> count<00:02:28.780> to<00:02:28.930> what<00:02:29.049> if<00:02:29.170> need<00:02:29.350> be

00:02:29.370 --> 00:02:29.380 
steady you can count to what if need be

00:02:29.380 --> 00:02:38.270 
steady you can count to what if need be
doing<00:02:29.890> something<00:02:30.190> like<00:02:30.220> 1<00:02:31.170> 2<00:02:32.170> 3<00:02:33.239> 4

00:02:38.270 --> 00:02:38.280 

00:02:38.280 --> 00:02:41.520 

in<00:02:39.280> contrast<00:02:39.790> to<00:02:39.910> the<00:02:40.090> beat<00:02:40.330> the<00:02:40.900> rhythm<00:02:41.320> is

00:02:41.520 --> 00:02:41.530 
in contrast to the beat the rhythm is

00:02:41.530 --> 00:02:44.760 
in contrast to the beat the rhythm is
what<00:02:42.430> you<00:02:42.550> play<00:02:42.790> but<00:02:43.480> more<00:02:43.750> than<00:02:43.870> this<00:02:44.050> the

00:02:44.760 --> 00:02:44.770 
what you play but more than this the

00:02:44.770 --> 00:02:47.250 
what you play but more than this the
rhythm<00:02:45.070> is<00:02:45.160> what<00:02:45.310> you<00:02:45.430> do<00:02:45.640> in<00:02:45.910> relation<00:02:46.750> to<00:02:46.900> the

00:02:47.250 --> 00:02:47.260 
rhythm is what you do in relation to the

00:02:47.260 --> 00:02:50.640 
rhythm is what you do in relation to the
beat<00:02:47.440> so<00:02:48.370> if<00:02:48.460> I<00:02:48.520> give<00:02:48.670> you<00:02:48.790> a<00:02:48.820> beat<00:02:49.440> take<00:02:50.440> note

00:02:50.640 --> 00:02:50.650 
beat so if I give you a beat take note

00:02:50.650 --> 00:02:56.210 
beat so if I give you a beat take note
if<00:02:50.680> you're<00:02:50.890> playing<00:02:51.160> with<00:02:51.400> the<00:02:51.550> beat<00:02:54.330> in

00:02:56.210 --> 00:02:56.220 
if you're playing with the beat in

00:02:56.220 --> 00:03:09.590 
if you're playing with the beat in
between<00:02:57.220> the<00:02:57.340> beats<00:03:01.890> or<00:03:02.890> a<00:03:02.950> little<00:03:03.220> of<00:03:03.310> both

00:03:09.590 --> 00:03:09.600 

00:03:09.600 --> 00:03:13.230 

distinction<00:03:10.600> between<00:03:10.750> beat<00:03:11.740> and<00:03:11.950> rhythm<00:03:12.310> is

00:03:13.230 --> 00:03:13.240 
distinction between beat and rhythm is

00:03:13.240 --> 00:03:15.360 
distinction between beat and rhythm is
subtle<00:03:13.720> but<00:03:14.470> the<00:03:14.650> important<00:03:15.010> difference<00:03:15.280> to

00:03:15.360 --> 00:03:15.370 
subtle but the important difference to

00:03:15.370 --> 00:03:17.220 
subtle but the important difference to
remember<00:03:15.700> is<00:03:15.880> that<00:03:16.180> a<00:03:16.240> beat<00:03:16.480> is<00:03:16.660> what<00:03:16.840> you<00:03:16.930> feel

00:03:17.220 --> 00:03:17.230 
remember is that a beat is what you feel

00:03:17.230 --> 00:03:25.160 
remember is that a beat is what you feel
and<00:03:17.470> a<00:03:18.070> rhythm<00:03:18.250> is<00:03:18.550> what<00:03:18.820> you<00:03:18.880> play

00:03:25.160 --> 00:03:25.170 

00:03:25.170 --> 00:03:27.350 

Munich<00:03:25.410> a<00:03:25.500> terrific<00:03:25.950> you<00:03:26.130> I'm<00:03:26.819> going<00:03:27.030> to<00:03:27.120> tell

00:03:27.350 --> 00:03:27.360 
Munich a terrific you I'm going to tell

00:03:27.360 --> 00:03:29.960 
Munich a terrific you I'm going to tell
you<00:03:27.480> which<00:03:27.690> beats<00:03:28.020> I<00:03:28.290> want<00:03:28.709> you<00:03:28.800> to<00:03:28.920> play<00:03:29.099> on<00:03:29.130> so

00:03:29.960 --> 00:03:29.970 
you which beats I want you to play on so

00:03:29.970 --> 00:03:31.130 
you which beats I want you to play on so
for<00:03:30.180> example<00:03:30.480> if<00:03:30.540> I<00:03:30.630> were<00:03:30.690> to<00:03:30.780> play<00:03:30.870> something

00:03:31.130 --> 00:03:31.140 
for example if I were to play something

00:03:31.140 --> 00:03:40.760 
for example if I were to play something
like<00:03:31.290> this<00:03:31.470> I<00:03:38.780> could<00:03:39.780> tell<00:03:39.959> you<00:03:40.050> to<00:03:40.230> play<00:03:40.530> on

00:03:40.760 --> 00:03:40.770 
like this I could tell you to play on

00:03:40.770 --> 00:03:42.920 
like this I could tell you to play on
the<00:03:40.980> first<00:03:41.250> and<00:03:41.580> third<00:03:41.940> beats<00:03:42.239> or<00:03:42.450> to<00:03:42.569> hit<00:03:42.750> on

00:03:42.920 --> 00:03:42.930 
the first and third beats or to hit on

00:03:42.930 --> 00:03:44.660 
the first and third beats or to hit on
one<00:03:43.200> and<00:03:43.319> three<00:03:43.530> so<00:03:44.220> if<00:03:44.280> I<00:03:44.340> were<00:03:44.400> to<00:03:44.459> play<00:03:44.610> it

00:03:44.660 --> 00:03:44.670 
one and three so if I were to play it

00:03:44.670 --> 00:03:45.890 
one and three so if I were to play it
again<00:03:44.850> when<00:03:45.060> counting<00:03:45.420> you'll<00:03:45.600> be<00:03:45.720> something

00:03:45.890 --> 00:03:45.900 
again when counting you'll be something

00:03:45.900 --> 00:03:55.460 
again when counting you'll be something
like<00:03:46.080> this<00:03:46.280> 1<00:03:47.280> 2<00:03:48.239> 3<00:03:49.190> 4<00:03:50.269> 1<00:03:51.269> 2<00:03:52.250> 3<00:03:53.250> 4<00:03:54.209> so<00:03:55.200> if<00:03:55.260> I<00:03:55.319> would

00:03:55.460 --> 00:03:55.470 
like this 1 2 3 4 1 2 3 4 so if I would

00:03:55.470 --> 00:03:56.870 
like this 1 2 3 4 1 2 3 4 so if I would
give<00:03:55.590> you<00:03:55.650> another<00:03:55.860> example<00:03:56.340> -<00:03:56.400> hey<00:03:56.550> it's<00:03:56.760> a

00:03:56.870 --> 00:03:56.880 
give you another example - hey it's a

00:03:56.880 --> 00:04:00.050 
give you another example - hey it's a
hit<00:03:57.120> on<00:03:57.150> 1<00:03:57.750> 3<00:03:58.319> &amp;<00:03:58.440> 4<00:03:58.709> you<00:03:58.980> should<00:03:59.700> know<00:03:59.850> then

00:04:00.050 --> 00:04:00.060 
hit on 1 3 &amp; 4 you should know then

00:04:00.060 --> 00:04:01.910 
hit on 1 3 &amp; 4 you should know then
expect<00:04:00.840> it'll<00:04:01.110> sound<00:04:01.230> something<00:04:01.560> like<00:04:01.590> this

00:04:01.910 --> 00:04:01.920 
expect it'll sound something like this

00:04:01.920 --> 00:04:14.780 
expect it'll sound something like this
1<00:04:02.340> 2<00:04:03.299> 3<00:04:04.290> 4<00:04:05.360> 1<00:04:06.360> 2<00:04:06.690> 3<00:04:07.400> 4<00:04:13.040> so<00:04:14.040> this<00:04:14.160> is<00:04:14.280> what<00:04:14.430> we<00:04:14.519> call

00:04:14.780 --> 00:04:14.790 
1 2 3 4 1 2 3 4 so this is what we call

00:04:14.790 --> 00:04:17.270 
1 2 3 4 1 2 3 4 so this is what we call
the<00:04:15.239> count<00:04:15.510> a<00:04:15.810> lot<00:04:16.200> of<00:04:16.320> systems<00:04:16.620> will<00:04:16.799> have<00:04:16.950> you

00:04:17.270 --> 00:04:17.280 
the count a lot of systems will have you

00:04:17.280 --> 00:04:19.580 
the count a lot of systems will have you
count<00:04:18.269> everything<00:04:18.720> including<00:04:19.290> the<00:04:19.380> beats

00:04:19.580 --> 00:04:19.590 
count everything including the beats

00:04:19.590 --> 00:04:21.469 
count everything including the beats
that<00:04:19.680> you<00:04:19.859> do<00:04:19.979> not<00:04:20.160> play<00:04:20.430> but<00:04:20.940> I<00:04:20.970> only<00:04:21.150> want<00:04:21.389> you

00:04:21.469 --> 00:04:21.479 
that you do not play but I only want you

00:04:21.479 --> 00:04:25.600 
that you do not play but I only want you
to<00:04:21.570> count<00:04:21.780> or<00:04:22.019> say<00:04:22.320> the<00:04:23.010> beats<00:04:23.280> that<00:04:23.580> you<00:04:23.970> play

00:04:25.600 --> 00:04:25.610 
to count or say the beats that you play

00:04:25.610 --> 00:04:27.800 
to count or say the beats that you play
no<00:04:26.610> matter<00:04:26.820> what<00:04:27.000> rhythm<00:04:27.360> you're<00:04:27.510> playing

00:04:27.800 --> 00:04:27.810 
no matter what rhythm you're playing

00:04:27.810 --> 00:04:29.840 
no matter what rhythm you're playing
it's<00:04:28.470> a<00:04:28.590> good<00:04:28.770> idea<00:04:28.889> to<00:04:29.160> try<00:04:29.310> and<00:04:29.490> tap<00:04:29.669> your

00:04:29.840 --> 00:04:29.850 
it's a good idea to try and tap your

00:04:29.850 --> 00:04:32.480 
it's a good idea to try and tap your
foot<00:04:30.090> as<00:04:30.330> you<00:04:30.630> play<00:04:30.890> doesn't<00:04:31.890> matter<00:04:32.070> if<00:04:32.310> you

00:04:32.480 --> 00:04:32.490 
foot as you play doesn't matter if you

00:04:32.490 --> 00:04:35.120

don't recommend doing that during
practicing<00:04:48.570> the<00:04:49.289> point<00:04:49.560> is<00:04:49.740> that<00:04:50.370> you<00:04:50.580> use

00:04:51.140 --> 00:04:51.150 
practicing the point is that you use

00:04:51.150 --> 00:04:53.360 
practicing the point is that you use
your<00:04:51.180> body<00:04:51.600> to<00:04:51.990> help<00:04:52.140> feel<00:04:52.500> the<00:04:52.680> beat<00:04:52.830> anything

00:04:53.360 --> 00:04:53.370 
your body to help feel the beat anything

00:04:53.370 --> 00:04:55.310 
your body to help feel the beat anything
about<00:04:53.460> your<00:04:53.640> hands<00:04:53.850> of<00:04:53.940> course<00:04:54.180> and<00:04:55.020> by<00:04:55.140> using

00:04:55.310 --> 00:04:55.320 
about your hands of course and by using

00:04:55.320 --> 00:04:56.540 
about your hands of course and by using
your<00:04:55.500> foot<00:04:55.740> you<00:04:55.979> just<00:04:56.130> can<00:04:56.220> make<00:04:56.370> sure<00:04:56.460> that

00:04:56.540 --> 00:04:56.550 
your foot you just can make sure that

00:04:56.550 --> 00:04:58.250 
your foot you just can make sure that
you<00:04:56.669> can<00:04:56.789> keep<00:04:56.970> track<00:04:57.210> of<00:04:57.270> the<00:04:57.510> beat<00:04:57.720> while

00:04:58.250 --> 00:04:58.260 
you can keep track of the beat while

00:04:58.260 --> 00:04:59.750 
you can keep track of the beat while
you're<00:04:58.470> playing<00:04:58.650> so<00:04:58.919> remember<00:04:59.130> tap<00:04:59.430> your<00:04:59.580> foot

00:04:59.750 --> 00:04:59.760 
you're playing so remember tap your foot

00:04:59.760 --> 00:05:02.930 
you're playing so remember tap your foot
as<00:04:59.970> we<00:05:00.120> move<00:05:00.300> forward<00:05:01.370> okay<00:05:02.370> let's<00:05:02.580> try<00:05:02.700> some

00:05:02.930 --> 00:05:02.940 
as we move forward okay let's try some

00:05:02.940 --> 00:05:05.210 
as we move forward okay let's try some
examples<00:05:03.110> for<00:05:04.110> the<00:05:04.169> following<00:05:04.560> example<00:05:05.100> we're

00:05:05.210 --> 00:05:05.220 
examples for the following example we're

00:05:05.220 --> 00:05:06.590 
examples for the following example we're
going<00:05:05.430> to<00:05:05.520> be<00:05:05.610> hitting<00:05:05.820> your<00:05:06.090> open<00:05:06.419> E<00:05:06.570> string

00:05:06.590 --> 00:05:06.600 
going to be hitting your open E string

00:05:06.600 --> 00:05:09.740 
going to be hitting your open E string
on<00:05:07.080> the<00:05:07.229> first<00:05:07.500> and<00:05:07.740> the<00:05:08.160> fourth<00:05:08.580> beats<00:05:08.880> I<00:05:09.120> will

00:05:09.740 --> 00:05:09.750 
on the first and the fourth beats I will

00:05:09.750 --> 00:05:11.360 
on the first and the fourth beats I will
give<00:05:09.870> you<00:05:09.960> a<00:05:09.990> four<00:05:10.380> count<00:05:10.560> which<00:05:10.890> is<00:05:11.130> the

00:05:11.360 --> 00:05:11.370 
give you a four count which is the

00:05:11.370 --> 00:05:13.340 
give you a four count which is the
musicians<00:05:11.850> equivalent<00:05:12.360> of<00:05:12.510> a<00:05:12.660> ready<00:05:13.080> set<00:05:13.320> go

00:05:13.340 --> 00:05:13.350 
musicians equivalent of a ready set go

00:05:13.350 --> 00:05:15.170 
musicians equivalent of a ready set go
this<00:05:13.740> way<00:05:13.860> you<00:05:13.919> know<00:05:14.130> when<00:05:14.310> to<00:05:14.430> come<00:05:14.580> in<00:05:14.700> so

00:05:15.170 --> 00:05:15.180 
this way you know when to come in so

00:05:15.180 --> 00:05:35.730 
this way you know when to come in so
here<00:05:15.300> we<00:05:15.390> go<00:05:15.479> one<00:05:16.440> two<00:05:16.680> three<00:05:18.380> four<00:05:19.430> one

00:05:35.730 --> 00:05:35.740 

00:05:35.740 --> 00:05:39.310 

small<00:05:36.740> note<00:05:36.949> about<00:05:37.340> duration<00:05:37.880> I<00:05:38.240> am<00:05:38.900> stopping

00:05:39.310 --> 00:05:39.320 
small note about duration I am stopping

00:05:39.320 --> 00:05:41.710 
small note about duration I am stopping
the<00:05:39.560> notes<00:05:39.800> from<00:05:40.310> ringing<00:05:40.580> while<00:05:41.120> the<00:05:41.389> second

00:05:41.710 --> 00:05:41.720 
the notes from ringing while the second

00:05:41.720 --> 00:05:43.570 
the notes from ringing while the second
and<00:05:41.870> third<00:05:41.990> beats<00:05:42.290> are<00:05:42.440> going<00:05:42.710> if<00:05:42.860> you<00:05:43.250> happen

00:05:43.570 --> 00:05:43.580 
and third beats are going if you happen

00:05:43.580 --> 00:05:45.730 
and third beats are going if you happen
to<00:05:43.610> let<00:05:43.820> the<00:05:43.970> notes<00:05:44.180> ring<00:05:44.810> across<00:05:45.169> those<00:05:45.470> beats

00:05:45.730 --> 00:05:45.740 
to let the notes ring across those beats

00:05:45.740 --> 00:05:47.020 
to let the notes ring across those beats
that's<00:05:45.949> not<00:05:46.100> a<00:05:46.130> big<00:05:46.310> deal<00:05:46.520> I<00:05:46.550> don't<00:05:46.729> really

00:05:47.020 --> 00:05:47.030 
that's not a big deal I don't really

00:05:47.030 --> 00:05:49.090 
that's not a big deal I don't really
care<00:05:47.240> right<00:05:47.510> now<00:05:47.540> if<00:05:48.110> the<00:05:48.440> notes<00:05:48.620> are<00:05:48.740> ringing

00:05:49.090 --> 00:05:49.100 
care right now if the notes are ringing

00:05:49.100 --> 00:05:50.230 
care right now if the notes are ringing
or<00:05:49.250> if<00:05:49.340> you're<00:05:49.460> stopping<00:05:49.699> them<00:05:49.940> so<00:05:50.060> if<00:05:50.150> you

00:05:50.230 --> 00:05:50.240 
or if you're stopping them so if you

00:05:50.240 --> 00:06:00.400 
or if you're stopping them so if you
want<00:05:50.389> to<00:05:50.419> try<00:05:50.600> something<00:05:50.870> like<00:05:50.900> this<00:05:59.350> not<00:06:00.350> a

00:06:00.400 --> 00:06:00.410 
want to try something like this not a

00:06:00.410 --> 00:06:02.350 
want to try something like this not a
big<00:06:00.590> deal<00:06:00.770> because<00:06:00.979> you're<00:06:01.310> both<00:06:02.000> examples

00:06:02.350 --> 00:06:02.360 
big deal because you're both examples

00:06:02.360 --> 00:06:03.550 
big deal because you're both examples
whether<00:06:02.660> you're<00:06:02.810> stopping<00:06:03.050> the<00:06:03.229> notes<00:06:03.410> or<00:06:03.500> you

00:06:03.550 --> 00:06:03.560 
whether you're stopping the notes or you

00:06:03.560 --> 00:06:05.350 
whether you're stopping the notes or you
learn<00:06:03.680> on<00:06:03.770> the<00:06:03.860> ring<00:06:04.100> and<00:06:04.280> both<00:06:04.850> examples

00:06:05.350 --> 00:06:05.360 
learn on the ring and both examples

00:06:05.360 --> 00:06:06.490 
learn on the ring and both examples
you're<00:06:05.449> hitting<00:06:05.690> on<00:06:05.810> the<00:06:05.900> first<00:06:06.139> and<00:06:06.350> the

00:06:06.490 --> 00:06:06.500 
you're hitting on the first and the

00:06:06.500 --> 00:06:07.779 
you're hitting on the first and the
fourth<00:06:06.740> beats<00:06:06.949> and<00:06:07.100> that's<00:06:07.220> all<00:06:07.370> that<00:06:07.490> matters

00:06:07.779 --> 00:06:07.789 
fourth beats and that's all that matters

00:06:07.789 --> 00:06:08.920 
fourth beats and that's all that matters
right<00:06:07.940> now<00:06:08.000> in<00:06:08.270> time<00:06:08.479> that's<00:06:08.690> a<00:06:08.750> very

00:06:08.920 --> 00:06:08.930 
right now in time that's a very

00:06:08.930 --> 00:06:10.570 
right now in time that's a very
important<00:06:09.320> distinction<00:06:09.620> or<00:06:10.160> right<00:06:10.310> now<00:06:10.490> it

00:06:10.570 --> 00:06:10.580 
important distinction or right now it

00:06:10.580 --> 00:06:12.820 
important distinction or right now it
doesn't<00:06:10.729> really<00:06:10.880> matter<00:06:11.180> going<00:06:12.169> forward<00:06:12.650> with

00:06:12.820 --> 00:06:12.830 
doesn't really matter going forward with

00:06:12.830 --> 00:06:14.379 
doesn't really matter going forward with
the<00:06:12.889> next<00:06:13.100> example<00:06:13.460> I<00:06:13.580> am<00:06:13.760> going<00:06:14.000> to<00:06:14.210> let<00:06:14.330> the

00:06:14.379 --> 00:06:14.389 
the next example I am going to let the

00:06:14.389 --> 00:06:16.180 
the next example I am going to let the
note<00:06:14.570> ring<00:06:14.840> and<00:06:15.320> in<00:06:15.500> this<00:06:15.620> example<00:06:15.979> we're

00:06:16.180 --> 00:06:16.190 
note ring and in this example we're

00:06:16.190 --> 00:06:18.010 
note ring and in this example we're
going<00:06:16.310> to<00:06:16.400> only<00:06:16.669> be<00:06:16.850> hitting<00:06:17.210> on<00:06:17.419> the<00:06:17.660> third

00:06:18.010 --> 00:06:18.020 
going to only be hitting on the third

00:06:18.020 --> 00:06:19.930 
going to only be hitting on the third
beat<00:06:18.530> so<00:06:18.979> again<00:06:19.220> I'll<00:06:19.340> give<00:06:19.460> you<00:06:19.520> a<00:06:19.580> four<00:06:19.789> count

00:06:19.930 --> 00:06:19.940 
beat so again I'll give you a four count

00:06:19.940 --> 00:06:45.730 
beat so again I'll give you a four count
and<00:06:20.180> we'll<00:06:20.479> begin<00:06:20.630> one<00:06:21.500> two<00:06:22.449> three<00:06:23.449> four

00:06:45.730 --> 00:06:45.740 

00:06:45.740 --> 00:06:48.110 

the<00:06:46.740> rhythms<00:06:47.040> are<00:06:47.160> all<00:06:47.280> pretty<00:06:47.550> simple<00:06:47.850> right

00:06:48.110 --> 00:06:48.120 
the rhythms are all pretty simple right

00:06:48.120 --> 00:06:49.670 
the rhythms are all pretty simple right
now<00:06:48.150> and<00:06:48.480> is<00:06:48.540> not<00:06:48.570> a<00:06:48.720> lot<00:06:48.870> of<00:06:48.900> variation<00:06:49.290> that

00:06:49.670 --> 00:06:49.680 
now and is not a lot of variation that

00:06:49.680 --> 00:06:51.050 
now and is not a lot of variation that
we<00:06:49.770> can<00:06:49.920> do<00:06:50.070> until<00:06:50.250> we<00:06:50.460> get<00:06:50.580> into<00:06:50.760> some<00:06:50.970> other

00:06:51.050 --> 00:06:51.060 
we can do until we get into some other

00:06:51.060 --> 00:06:53.090 
we can do until we get into some other
things<00:06:51.260> but<00:06:52.260> we're<00:06:52.620> really<00:06:52.800> trying<00:06:52.980> to

00:06:53.090 --> 00:06:53.100 
things but we're really trying to

00:06:53.100 --> 00:06:54.200 
things but we're really trying to
establish<00:06:53.220> you're<00:06:53.610> just<00:06:53.730> two<00:06:53.850> points<00:06:54.180> right

00:06:54.200 --> 00:06:54.210 
establish you're just two points right

00:06:54.210 --> 00:06:57.680 
establish you're just two points right
now<00:06:54.360> one<00:06:55.080> be<00:06:56.040> able<00:06:56.130> to<00:06:56.280> count<00:06:56.580> a<00:06:56.730> rhythm<00:06:57.030> to

00:06:57.680 --> 00:06:57.690 
now one be able to count a rhythm to

00:06:57.690 --> 00:07:00.830 
now one be able to count a rhythm to
learn<00:06:58.230> to<00:06:58.410> tap<00:06:58.650> your<00:06:58.800> foot<00:06:59.100> while<00:06:59.610> you<00:06:59.670> play<00:07:00.000> in

00:07:00.830 --> 00:07:00.840 
learn to tap your foot while you play in

00:07:00.840 --> 00:07:02.720 
learn to tap your foot while you play in
other<00:07:00.930> words<00:07:01.170> we<00:07:01.590> have<00:07:01.710> to<00:07:01.800> understand<00:07:02.340> rhythm

00:07:02.720 --> 00:07:02.730 
other words we have to understand rhythm

00:07:02.730 --> 00:07:04.550 
other words we have to understand rhythm
and<00:07:03.120> to<00:07:03.270> be<00:07:03.360> able<00:07:03.450> to<00:07:03.540> keep<00:07:03.750> a<00:07:03.840> beat<00:07:04.080> while<00:07:04.440> you

00:07:04.550 --> 00:07:04.560 
and to be able to keep a beat while you
