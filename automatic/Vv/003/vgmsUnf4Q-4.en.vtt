00:00:08.290 --> 00:00:13.330
 the Papuans like so many other peoples of 

00:00:10.870 --> 00:00:15.070
 the earth adopted the meaning of 

00:00:13.330 --> 00:00:18.550
 the colors observing the ones in the 

00:00:15.070 --> 00:00:20.410
 nature especially in birds and not 

00:00:18.550 --> 00:00:22.599
 It is by chance that on the same island 

00:00:20.410 --> 00:00:26.820
 of new guinea live one of the most 

00:00:22.599 --> 00:00:26.820
 big or that look bright colors 

00:00:37.310 --> 00:00:44.030
 he common Cassowary weighs 60 kilos and those 

00:00:41.060 --> 00:00:46.940
 blue and red fleshy lobes throw 

00:00:44.030 --> 00:00:51.050
 a message different from clark says he 

00:00:46.940 --> 00:00:53.810
 I am sexually active in this case 

00:00:51.050 --> 00:00:56.090
 males and females are similar but 

00:00:53.810 --> 00:00:58.640
 normal among birds is that it is the 

00:00:56.090 --> 00:01:01.400
 male who shows sexual colors more 

00:00:58.640 --> 00:01:03.620
 spectacular that's precisely what 

00:01:01.400 --> 00:01:06.160
 that can be observed every year in the 

00:01:03.620 --> 00:01:06.160
 Galapagos Islands 

00:01:24.420 --> 00:01:29.070
 the males of the frigates are 

00:01:26.759 --> 00:01:31.680
 coming from the ocean and choose the 

00:01:29.070 --> 00:01:34.229
 breeding sites are relatives of the 

00:01:31.680 --> 00:01:34.590
 pelicans but they use their bag for another 

00:01:34.229 --> 00:01:37.409
 thing 

00:01:34.590 --> 00:01:39.149
 they swell her disproportionately exposing 

00:01:37.409 --> 00:01:42.000
 the color incarnated to the females that 

00:01:39.149 --> 00:01:46.159
 they fly over the area to choose that 

00:01:42.000 --> 00:01:46.159
 with the biggest and reddest bag 

00:01:56.630 --> 00:02:01.549
 this exaggerated behavior of ostentation 

00:01:59.270 --> 00:02:04.490
 of male birds is common in 

00:02:01.549 --> 00:02:07.130
 the entire planet in tanzania the 

00:02:04.490 --> 00:02:09.769
 bustards cor and usually discrete 

00:02:07.130 --> 00:02:12.050
 and cryptically they strut, swelling their 

00:02:09.769 --> 00:02:14.599
 white feathers to shine in the sun 

00:02:12.050 --> 00:02:18.040
 equatorial with the same sexual purpose that 

00:02:14.599 --> 00:02:18.040
 the galapagos frigates 

00:02:18.770 --> 00:02:22.940
 these exhibitions pose a risk 

00:02:20.930 --> 00:02:24.590
 for the males that can be 

00:02:22.940 --> 00:02:27.110
 easily located by the 

00:02:24.590 --> 00:02:29.840
 predators but success in the 

00:02:27.110 --> 00:02:31.910
 reproduction is much more important to 

00:02:29.840 --> 00:02:34.760
 end of the day an individual without 

00:02:31.910 --> 00:02:38.030
 offspring is a dead end 

00:02:34.760 --> 00:02:40.820
 genetic, it's enough for them to teach 

00:02:38.030 --> 00:02:45.100
 his new shoes the legs alcatraz 

00:02:40.820 --> 00:02:45.100
 blue has a name that says it all 

00:02:52.310 --> 00:02:58.110
 and wherever they are, the important thing is 

00:02:55.530 --> 00:03:00.569
 move the colors to show the 

00:02:58.110 --> 00:03:03.060
 partner good health to consolidate 

00:03:00.569 --> 00:03:04.530
 the couple's links or just 

00:03:03.060 --> 00:03:07.680
 to cause the maturation of 

00:03:04.530 --> 00:03:10.170
 sexual organs inside it alone 

00:03:07.680 --> 00:03:12.569
 vision of the sexual colors provokes 

00:03:10.170 --> 00:03:13.980
 a chain reaction and unleashes the 

00:03:12.569 --> 00:03:17.480
 production of the necessary hormones 

00:03:13.980 --> 00:03:17.480
 for the reproductive process 

00:03:24.610 --> 00:03:28.960
 the enormous energy expenditure that the 

00:03:26.950 --> 00:03:31.360
 males invest in exhibiting more and 

00:03:28.960 --> 00:03:33.400
 better demonstrates the great importance of 

00:03:31.360 --> 00:03:37.140
 the function of colors in the life of 

00:03:33.400 --> 00:03:37.140
 the animals that can distinguish them 

00:03:38.520 --> 00:03:42.930
 these real payments from india for 

00:03:40.650 --> 00:03:45.240
 example are seen in the obligation of 

00:03:42.930 --> 00:03:48.240
 fascinate the females literally if 

00:03:45.240 --> 00:03:52.430
 they want to copulate them brown and ugly 

00:03:48.240 --> 00:03:54.140
 enjoy the show and choose 

00:03:52.430 --> 00:03:56.690
 yes 

00:03:54.140 --> 00:03:58.970
 in the case of the flamingos the pink 

00:03:56.690 --> 00:04:01.550
 lighting of their wings and their dances 

00:03:58.970 --> 00:04:04.310
 they also serve to synchronize the zeal 

00:04:01.550 --> 00:04:06.290
 of the adults of the colony all the 

00:04:04.310 --> 00:04:08.150
 chickens must grow in time to be able 

00:04:06.290 --> 00:04:10.760
 go flying before the water gets 

00:04:08.150 --> 00:04:12.880
 Evaporate by the heat issue of life or 

00:04:10.760 --> 00:04:12.880
 death 

00:04:33.969 --> 00:04:39.039
 and as always humans 

00:04:36.610 --> 00:04:41.349
 endowed with an excellent view to 

00:04:39.039 --> 00:04:43.269
 appreciate the inheritance colors of your

 trees has introduced the color in its 

00:04:45.879 --> 00:04:53.860
 culture stealing feathers from birds 

00:04:48.519 --> 00:04:56.589
 and imitating without fail this is a 

00:04:53.860 --> 00:04:58.449
 ceremony called anime is celebrated in 

00:04:56.589 --> 00:05:00.669

 and how colors are not 

00:05:28.219 --> 00:05:33.529
 protagonists this time through cultural 

00:05:31.039 --> 00:05:35.949
 instead of genetics as in the case of 

00:05:33.529 --> 00:05:35.949
 the birds 

00:05:36.700 --> 00:05:41.280
 identical methods for the same purposes 

00:05:43.030 --> 00:05:46.590
 more people
