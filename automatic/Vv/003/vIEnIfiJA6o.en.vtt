00:00:08.150 --> 00:00:13.410
 Hello dear friends with you Tom 

00:00:10.950 --> 00:00:15.389
 vazquez in this video we will look at a new 

00:00:13.410 --> 00:00:18.480
 map called Carpathians 

00:00:15.389 --> 00:00:20.699
 recently added to d in the server I already 

00:00:18.480 --> 00:00:23.039
 managed to make a first impression about 

00:00:20.699 --> 00:00:26.160
 I want to share this with you 

00:00:23.039 --> 00:00:28.590
 the card is awesome it not only pleases 

00:00:26.160 --> 00:00:30.990
 the eye she is not only beautiful but also 

00:00:28.590 --> 00:00:34.500
 impressive in its scope 

00:00:30.990 --> 00:00:38.760
 simplicity on it very much seems to me 

00:00:34.500 --> 00:00:41.550
 it will be fun and perky ride and she 

00:00:38.760 --> 00:00:44.360
 there is every chance of becoming a better card in the game 

00:00:41.550 --> 00:00:48.870
 at least such a first look 

00:00:44.360 --> 00:00:51.980
 felt card is made very simple 

00:00:48.870 --> 00:00:54.629
 for the most part consists of a field and 

00:00:51.980 --> 00:00:58.199
 there are also several hills on 

00:00:54.629 --> 00:01:01.170
 one of which is dilapidated 

00:00:58.199 --> 00:01:04.500
 the fortress stands and we go there 

00:01:01.170 --> 00:01:07.860
 now we are heading a small fortress 

00:01:04.500 --> 00:01:10.830
 consists of several walls of several 

00:01:07.860 --> 00:01:13.710
 bridges and it is already happy for the future 

00:01:10.830 --> 00:01:16.619
 on the future city map yes here 

00:01:13.710 --> 00:01:17.990
 Of course, very few of all of these. 

00:01:16.619 --> 00:01:20.820
 urban 

00:01:17.990 --> 00:01:24.030
 monuments but still all the same already 

00:01:20.820 --> 00:01:27.180
 pleases the eye and it is already felt that soon 

00:01:24.030 --> 00:01:29.670
 city ​​map will be added and finally 

00:01:27.180 --> 00:01:32.460
 you can already make a new 

00:01:29.670 --> 00:01:34.950
 impression about this game because as 

00:01:32.460 --> 00:01:37.250
 of this all the cards were essentially from more 

00:01:34.950 --> 00:01:40.150
 or not some 

00:01:37.250 --> 00:01:44.670
 variativnyh corridors or something 

00:01:40.150 --> 00:01:47.800
 you have them so well this card is different 

00:01:44.670 --> 00:01:50.230
 developers decided to push off from those 

00:01:47.800 --> 00:01:52.990
 ideas that I think 

00:01:50.230 --> 00:01:58.210
 which were used in previous 

00:01:52.990 --> 00:02:01.480
 maps yes some such facts they 

00:01:58.210 --> 00:02:06.370
 still did not clean up such as 

00:02:01.480 --> 00:02:07.619
 such as multi-level, and that is that 

00:02:06.370 --> 00:02:11.020
 mind dance 

00:02:07.619 --> 00:02:14.340
 like for example on the ashen river where we have 

00:02:11.020 --> 00:02:17.410
 there are essentially three corridors 

00:02:14.340 --> 00:02:20.260
 the card itself is divided into three parts 

00:02:17.410 --> 00:02:23.230
 the map is also about here 

00:02:20.260 --> 00:02:27.070
 divided into two parts but on it on this 

00:02:23.230 --> 00:02:29.830
 map is much faster you can get from 

00:02:27.070 --> 00:02:30.880
 one plot to another is not something like 

00:02:29.830 --> 00:02:34.600
 on the ashen river 

00:02:30.880 --> 00:02:39.880
 but also rid of maps from the corridors as 

00:02:34.600 --> 00:02:42.970
 for example, on the map of Karelia this is approximately 

00:02:39.880 --> 00:02:45.220
 so well, plus there is no such abundant 

00:02:42.970 --> 00:02:47.440
 vegetation like the jungle that is 

00:02:45.220 --> 00:02:51.010
 everything is done to simplify 

00:02:47.440 --> 00:02:54.340
 card and give the players what they are 

00:02:51.010 --> 00:02:56.140
 finally want to give normal normal 

00:02:54.340 --> 00:02:58.300
 card for the game 

00:02:56.140 --> 00:02:59.739
 so that it was in the first place 

00:02:58.300 --> 00:03:01.140
 convenient to play 

00:02:59.739 --> 00:03:04.840
 they 

00:03:01.140 --> 00:03:06.850
 please your eyes and how in my opinion 

00:03:04.840 --> 00:03:10.870
 According to the first impression 

00:03:06.850 --> 00:03:14.740
 developers got it maybe 

00:03:10.870 --> 00:03:15.700
 Of course when the card will be released on the BTR on 

00:03:14.740 --> 00:03:18.880
 primary server 

00:03:15.700 --> 00:03:23.050
 there may be an impression will change but 

00:03:18.880 --> 00:03:27.190
 while I think there will still be a map 

00:03:23.050 --> 00:03:29.620
 great maybe it somehow remake 

00:03:27.190 --> 00:03:34.440
 Maybe not yet I do not know, but let's 

00:03:29.620 --> 00:03:38.080
 let's see that there are three points here 

00:03:34.440 --> 00:03:39.070
 normal mode three points to point c me 

00:03:38.080 --> 00:03:42.520
 seems to be going 

00:03:39.070 --> 00:03:46.900
 often heavy tanks because you don’t 

00:03:42.520 --> 00:03:48.760
 just much easier to roll on the castle 

00:03:46.900 --> 00:03:49.810
 this fortress will most likely go 

00:03:48.760 --> 00:03:52.450
 Firstly 

00:03:49.810 --> 00:03:55.180
 medium tanks light tanks to 

00:03:52.450 --> 00:03:57.000
 occupy this hillock and fire already 

00:03:55.180 --> 00:04:00.040
 for all the rest. 

00:03:57.000 --> 00:04:02.200
 poteshki will be and indeed self-propelled guns 

00:04:00.040 --> 00:04:04.270
 will most likely get up on these 

00:04:02.200 --> 00:04:08.140
 here are the mounds and shoot all 

00:04:04.270 --> 00:04:09.970
 other tanks as well as the point B will be for 

00:04:08.140 --> 00:04:12.940
 that point which is in the middle 

00:04:09.970 --> 00:04:15.640
 will already fight 

00:04:12.940 --> 00:04:16.750
 all the other tanks when they capture 

00:04:15.640 --> 00:04:19.230
 all other points 

00:04:16.750 --> 00:04:20.920
 I think, in principle, succeeded 

00:04:19.230 --> 00:04:25.900
 developers managed to combine 

00:04:20.920 --> 00:04:28.660
 simplicity and this beauty all 

00:04:25.900 --> 00:04:32.830
 transfer to this card and indeed to the game 

00:04:28.660 --> 00:04:34.960
 and I think it is worth waiting for such 

00:04:32.830 --> 00:04:38.080
 maps and generally similar direction 

00:04:34.960 --> 00:04:38.680
 the direction of the cards for me personally 

00:04:38.080 --> 00:04:41.170
 pleases 

00:04:38.680 --> 00:04:43.840
 One problem seems to me to be 

00:04:41.170 --> 00:04:45.790
 less if the developers go by 

00:04:43.840 --> 00:04:49.540
 the same path will create similar 

00:04:45.790 --> 00:04:53.730
 the cards are already one problem for sure 

00:04:49.540 --> 00:04:55.300
 will be less and it seems to me 

00:04:53.730 --> 00:04:57.720
 developers are going in the right 

00:04:55.300 --> 00:05:00.000
 direction will be 

00:04:57.720 --> 00:05:03.690
 follow the developments and wish 

00:05:00.000 --> 00:05:07.530
 good luck well that's about like this on this 

00:05:03.690 --> 00:05:09.450
 basically all leave your comments 

00:05:07.530 --> 00:05:13.110
 what do you think 

00:05:09.450 --> 00:05:14.910
 did the moon card succeed leave 

00:05:13.110 --> 00:05:18.540
 comments did you ride it or 

00:05:14.910 --> 00:05:22.830
 No, how did you like it in her 

00:05:18.540 --> 00:05:25.500
 changed so that it is possible that you do not 

00:05:22.830 --> 00:05:27.810
 liked in general comment on 

00:05:25.500 --> 00:05:31.790
 that's all thank you all subscribe to 

00:05:27.810 --> 00:05:31.790
