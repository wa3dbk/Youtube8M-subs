00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.620
 asking for another edition of codecs 2000 

00:00:02.460 --> 00:00:06.779
 its new program of the prisa 

00:00:04.620 --> 00:00:09.599
 entertainment during e3 abuses 

00:00:06.779 --> 00:00:12.860
 revealed the novelty of eternal conflict 

00:00:09.599 --> 00:00:16.470
 first event of the software store 

00:00:12.860 --> 00:00:18.690
 two new heroes information how it goes 

00:00:16.470 --> 00:00:21.930
 what event will the 

00:00:18.690 --> 00:00:26.099
 duration and what she intends with this 

00:00:21.930 --> 00:00:28.349
 expansion ros eternal conflict will be 

00:00:26.099 --> 00:00:31.080
 the first expansion of heroes of the 

00:00:28.349 --> 00:00:32.940
 storm because it will last for several months 

00:00:31.080 --> 00:00:35.130
 which not very well an expansion but is 

00:00:32.940 --> 00:00:37.680
 so he tells me he 's calling and it's 

00:00:35.130 --> 00:00:40.440
 inspired by the devil's world and is 

00:00:37.680 --> 00:00:41.309
 first event inspired by the world of 

00:00:40.440 --> 00:00:42.930
 breeze 

00:00:41.309 --> 00:00:45.539
 This means that we can have 

00:00:42.930 --> 00:00:48.899
 Moorish inspired event was craft in 

00:00:45.539 --> 00:00:52.800
 starcraft on many older would be 

00:00:48.899 --> 00:00:55.309
 very very good if it did this 

00:00:52.800 --> 00:00:59.640
 event it will have several events 

00:00:55.309 --> 00:01:01.920
 while active as the gong of the 

00:00:59.640 --> 00:01:03.480
 treasure reminds us of that 

00:01:01.920 --> 00:01:05.159
 players face the devil 3 that the 

00:01:03.480 --> 00:01:07.380
 the map and run outside the 

00:01:05.159 --> 00:01:10.170
 portal and the players have to beat that 

00:01:07.380 --> 00:01:13.049
 If you manage to defeat him, gold and 

00:01:10.170 --> 00:01:15.420
 will be at rest until storm 

00:01:13.049 --> 00:01:17.700
 before the match starts before 

00:01:15.420 --> 00:01:20.369
 doors open it will appear and will 

00:01:17.700 --> 00:01:22.200
 fall running through the portal the player 

00:01:20.369 --> 00:01:25.799
 manage to defeat him before he gets 

00:01:22.200 --> 00:01:27.780
 in the portal will receive additional gold in the 

00:01:25.799 --> 00:01:30.619
 end of the match the players will leave 

00:01:27.780 --> 00:01:31.950
 running desperate over him to 

00:01:30.619 --> 00:01:35.130
 get 

00:01:31.950 --> 00:01:37.530
 in addition she also presented two 

00:01:35.130 --> 00:01:40.250
 new heroes 

00:01:37.530 --> 00:01:43.439
 the first one is presented is the king 

00:01:40.250 --> 00:01:45.570
 skeleton lehor ic that was what she 

00:01:43.439 --> 00:01:48.689
 more showed during events already 

00:01:45.570 --> 00:01:51.380
 showing all the skills all is to 

00:01:48.689 --> 00:01:54.899
 its characteristics and its 

00:01:51.380 --> 00:01:56.520
 continents or heroic powers but 

00:01:54.899 --> 00:01:57.570
 what are the skills how does he 

00:01:56.520 --> 00:02:01.170
 it will work 

00:01:57.570 --> 00:02:04.920
 he is an oil a young warrior to his 

00:02:01.170 --> 00:02:07.320
 three basic skills are the first 

00:02:04.920 --> 00:02:09.569
 it's a want then suite in which it gives 

00:02:07.320 --> 00:02:11.430
 a cone attack on enemies 

00:02:09.569 --> 00:02:12.480
 we have the training group later 

00:02:11.430 --> 00:02:15.690
 train 

00:02:12.480 --> 00:02:18.629
 the hope of wanting to score the enemy 

00:02:15.690 --> 00:02:21.810
 begins to attack the enemy and drains life 

00:02:18.629 --> 00:02:25.200
 of this enemy and the third ability is 

00:02:21.810 --> 00:02:28.080
 ranch olk in which it projects itself as a 

00:02:25.200 --> 00:02:30.030
 Hi, I'm a ghost and after a while 

00:02:28.080 --> 00:02:32.250
 it throws itself where the pressure is and 

00:02:30.030 --> 00:02:34.430
 gives you an attack runs there is where the 

00:02:32.250 --> 00:02:38.010
 enemy but more skills 

00:02:34.430 --> 00:02:41.010
 interesting are its characteristic 

00:02:38.010 --> 00:02:42.720
 When he dies he does not come back for his 

00:02:41.010 --> 00:02:45.299
 empire does not return to base 

00:02:42.720 --> 00:02:48.090
 he becomes the king but a ghost 

00:02:45.299 --> 00:02:49.829
 while he's a ghost he stays around 

00:02:48.090 --> 00:02:52.290
 by the map and it can attack the enemies 

00:02:49.829 --> 00:02:56.190
 only when he attacks the enemies does he not 

00:02:52.290 --> 00:02:57.120
 cause harm it fills the bag of life 

00:02:56.190 --> 00:02:59.430
 of enemies 

00:02:57.120 --> 00:03:01.680
 We do not know yet if you're foolish. 

00:02:59.430 --> 00:03:04.049
 it decreases attack it does something with 

00:03:01.680 --> 00:03:07.560
 the more enemies he attacks the 

00:03:04.049 --> 00:03:10.200
 enemies faster it will reappear 

00:03:07.560 --> 00:03:12.599
 in the game and it reappears in the game where 

00:03:10.200 --> 00:03:14.549
 is the king fountain is a ghost he 

00:03:12.599 --> 00:03:16.349
 does not appear there at the base so if the 

00:03:14.549 --> 00:03:17.970
 wanting player can take the rest of it 

00:03:16.349 --> 00:03:19.889
 down there from the enemy 

00:03:17.970 --> 00:03:22.709
 I think I will not do it but they 

00:03:19.889 --> 00:03:26.160
 wish it could and were also shown 

00:03:22.709 --> 00:03:29.250
 two heroic powers of the LeÃ´nico 

00:03:26.160 --> 00:03:32.099
 first is the march of the black king in which 

00:03:29.250 --> 00:03:34.620
 he starts to attack in area all 

00:03:32.099 --> 00:03:36.599
 enemies and starts to walk straight and attack 

00:03:34.620 --> 00:03:40.260
 all enemies who are in your 

00:03:36.599 --> 00:03:43.200
 front giving damage in area but second 

00:03:40.260 --> 00:03:45.989
 the most interesting power in which the 

00:03:43.200 --> 00:03:50.250
 eric he is seeing the enemy and they 

00:03:45.989 --> 00:03:52.620
 moncho mary a chuck berry that is a 

00:03:50.250 --> 00:03:55.739
 construction in the form of one that can 

00:03:52.620 --> 00:03:59.310
 trap the enemy while looking at 

00:03:55.739 --> 00:04:00.840
 beating him to beat it too 

00:03:59.310 --> 00:04:03.720
 Interesting theoretical skills 

00:04:00.840 --> 00:04:06.510
 well creative and different from the 

00:04:03.720 --> 00:04:08.310
 that we have in the game item that much 

00:04:06.510 --> 00:04:10.739
 people also expected to be well 

00:04:08.310 --> 00:04:13.260
 Fun to play with Nelore transform 

00:04:10.739 --> 00:04:16.440
 in the king they use less enemies in tone to 

00:04:13.260 --> 00:04:19.049
 to hold on to his schulberg 

00:04:16.440 --> 00:04:20.870
 defeat their opponents and there is also 

00:04:19.049 --> 00:04:22.950
 spoke of the monk the second hero 

00:04:20.870 --> 00:04:25.540
 presented in e3 

00:04:22.950 --> 00:04:26.980
 it is a support but it has not been 

00:04:25.540 --> 00:04:30.220
 many of its characteristics 

00:04:26.980 --> 00:04:33.220
 as it will be during rivers of the 

00:04:30.220 --> 00:04:35.860
 storm it will get a lot of mobility is good 

00:04:33.220 --> 00:04:38.320
 to move very fast across the map goes 

00:04:35.860 --> 00:04:41.800
 be able to heal allies in 

00:04:38.320 --> 00:04:43.990
 drive and the big difference it 

00:04:41.800 --> 00:04:45.850
 their specialization that that power 

00:04:43.990 --> 00:04:49.480
 passive that active power that some 

00:04:45.850 --> 00:04:51.910
 have because their specialization is 

00:04:49.480 --> 00:04:53.770
 the first talent of the monk the monk 

00:04:51.910 --> 00:04:55.690
 when he creates his character when 

00:04:53.770 --> 00:04:57.400
 start the game the first choice you 

00:04:55.690 --> 00:04:58.420
 What are you going to do? 

00:04:57.400 --> 00:05:01.000
 Specialization 

00:04:58.420 --> 00:05:05.110
 will be a more offensive specialization 

00:05:01.000 --> 00:05:06.730
 or a more specialized support the 

00:05:05.110 --> 00:05:08.920
 which gives an idea that 

00:05:06.730 --> 00:05:11.650
 monk mantras the monk will power 

00:05:08.920 --> 00:05:13.120
 choose how he wants to play on the map 

00:05:11.650 --> 00:05:15.580
 he wants to have a specialization of 

00:05:13.120 --> 00:05:17.590
 attack a defense and specialization 

00:05:15.580 --> 00:05:20.470
 It was also shown an ability to 

00:05:17.590 --> 00:05:22.300
 one attack seven kicks and punches at the same 

00:05:20.470 --> 00:05:25.240
 time and an enemy were the only 

00:05:22.300 --> 00:05:28.270
 displayed monk skills during 

00:05:25.240 --> 00:05:30.670
 this launch of this disclosure at e3 

00:05:28.270 --> 00:05:34.480
 and to conclude she showed a video of 

00:05:30.670 --> 00:05:38.260
 internal conflict with the good heroes and 

00:05:34.480 --> 00:05:41.430
 bad heroes fighting on the new map of themselves 

00:05:38.260 --> 00:05:44.410
 inspired by devils of eternal conflict 

00:05:41.430 --> 00:05:47.290
 very cool a lot of fun with some 

00:05:44.410 --> 00:05:49.570
 easter eggs there for fans of the breeze and now 

00:05:47.290 --> 00:05:52.060
 just wait for the launch of this first 

00:05:49.570 --> 00:05:54.190

 arrive at the end of June for 

00:05:54.190 --> 00:05:59.530
 players will already be able to test 

00:05:56.890 --> 00:06:01.390
 test servers from the 23rd and 

00:05:59.530 --> 00:06:03.310
 Let's wait for these news that April 

00:06:01.390 --> 00:06:05.350
 is presenting for risotto 

00:06:03.310 --> 00:06:07.570
