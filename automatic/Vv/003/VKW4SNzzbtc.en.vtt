00:00:02.570 --> 00:00:13.250
 iomega saix and so I make you the 

00:00:09.200 --> 00:00:13.250
 tutoring on how to juggle 6 

00:00:28.400 --> 00:00:34.600
 finally short here is the technique is 

00:00:32.079 --> 00:00:39.680
 to sit well 

00:00:34.600 --> 00:00:41.090
 excuse me it's bumbling so see it 

00:00:39.680 --> 00:00:43.610
 the thing is to sit down 

00:00:41.090 --> 00:00:45.500
 this is how you can put a 

00:00:43.610 --> 00:00:47.809
 little chick under it is good 

00:00:45.500 --> 00:00:50.260
 it's not too bad and the technique in 

00:00:47.809 --> 00:00:54.280
 do is put your foot down 

00:00:50.260 --> 00:00:56.660
 is two guys farms 

00:00:54.280 --> 00:00:58.610
 look firm and kick the ball 

00:00:56.660 --> 00:01:01.610
 with the kick of the foot gets the upper hand 

00:00:58.610 --> 00:01:02.949
 like that well that your firm must not 

00:01:01.610 --> 00:01:10.070
 look for the Serbians let's look at what he 

00:01:02.949 --> 00:01:11.720
 must tap it is to juggle to six 

00:01:10.070 --> 00:01:22.000
 is important because without that you 

00:01:11.720 --> 00:01:22.000
 will not be able to make his mouth in jeans 

00:01:23.200 --> 00:01:25.570
 the speaker is true that it's boring 

00:01:24.219 --> 00:01:26.680
 to sit because if you send it 

00:01:25.570 --> 00:01:29.350
 far it will be necessary to rise 

00:01:26.680 --> 00:01:33.490
 that's boring so here's the thing it's 

00:01:29.350 --> 00:01:36.909
 to stay firm 

00:01:33.490 --> 00:01:39.600
 he is exactly like that and frankly that 

00:01:36.909 --> 00:01:39.600
 go alone after 

00:01:44.950 --> 00:01:58.780
 good after have to train both 

00:01:46.570 --> 00:02:00.039
 girls like this here and here after 

00:01:58.780 --> 00:02:02.640
 there is not much to say except to put 

00:02:00.039 --> 00:02:02.640
 the firm foot 

00:02:07.959 --> 00:02:11.200
 to good 

00:02:11.680 --> 00:02:14.680
 oops 

00:02:14.800 --> 00:02:23.690
 so here it was the end of the 

00:02:18.710 --> 00:02:27.040
 guardian the next it will be rather this 

00:02:23.690 --> 00:02:27.040
 will be mixed in style 

00:02:27.700 --> 00:02:33.290
 so I'm going to teach you a little 

00:02:31.250 --> 00:02:37.700
 chaining so round the world cross 

00:02:33.290 --> 00:02:38.740
 which pht mare move and then tbw 

00:02:37.700 --> 00:02:54.730
