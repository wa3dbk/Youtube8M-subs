welcome<00:00:05.220> to<00:00:05.399> inter<00:00:05.609> photo<00:00:05.790> TV<00:00:06.230> and<00:00:07.230> this<00:00:07.560> is

00:00:07.670 --> 00:00:07.680 
welcome to inter photo TV and this is

00:00:07.680 --> 00:00:12.109 
welcome to inter photo TV and this is
the<00:00:07.830> new<00:00:08.069> M<00:00:08.309> so<00:00:09.090> we<00:00:09.330> skip<00:00:10.049> from<00:00:10.860> this<00:00:11.100> Milan<00:00:11.549> we

00:00:12.109 --> 00:00:12.119 
the new M so we skip from this Milan we

00:00:12.119 --> 00:00:15.830 
the new M so we skip from this Milan we
skip<00:00:12.539> the<00:00:12.900> numbering<00:00:13.260> of<00:00:13.940> of<00:00:14.940> the<00:00:15.389> model<00:00:15.690> so

00:00:15.830 --> 00:00:15.840 
skip the numbering of of the model so

00:00:15.840 --> 00:00:18.880 
skip the numbering of of the model so
it's<00:00:16.020> just<00:00:16.619> the<00:00:16.920> new<00:00:17.190> like<00:00:17.460> em<00:00:17.789> the<00:00:18.060> digital<00:00:18.449> em

00:00:18.880 --> 00:00:18.890 
it's just the new like em the digital em

00:00:18.890 --> 00:00:22.489 
it's just the new like em the digital em
so<00:00:19.890> we<00:00:20.070> have<00:00:20.279> have<00:00:20.669> now<00:00:20.820> a<00:00:20.849> big<00:00:21.269> family<00:00:21.599> of<00:00:21.960> like

00:00:22.489 --> 00:00:22.499 
so we have have now a big family of like

00:00:22.499 --> 00:00:25.519 
so we have have now a big family of like
a<00:00:22.529> we<00:00:23.039> have<00:00:23.160> the<00:00:23.310> m9<00:00:23.640> m<00:00:23.939> 9p<00:00:24.449> we<00:00:24.990> have<00:00:25.140> the<00:00:25.259> Emmy

00:00:25.519 --> 00:00:25.529 
a we have the m9 m 9p we have the Emmy

00:00:25.529 --> 00:00:28.460 
a we have the m9 m 9p we have the Emmy
and<00:00:25.800> the<00:00:26.039> M<00:00:26.160> and<00:00:26.519> also<00:00:27.060> our<00:00:27.089> two<00:00:27.660> analog<00:00:28.109> models

00:00:28.460 --> 00:00:28.470 
and the M and also our two analog models

00:00:28.470 --> 00:00:34.670 
and the M and also our two analog models
the<00:00:28.650> m7<00:00:29.429> and<00:00:29.669> EMP<00:00:30.470> the<00:00:31.940> Leica<00:00:32.940> M<00:00:33.329> is<00:00:33.810> totally

00:00:34.670 --> 00:00:34.680 
the m7 and EMP the Leica M is totally

00:00:34.680 --> 00:00:38.720 
the m7 and EMP the Leica M is totally
different<00:00:34.800> to<00:00:35.130> what<00:00:35.460> we<00:00:36.170> have<00:00:37.170> been<00:00:37.730> producing

00:00:38.720 --> 00:00:38.730 
different to what we have been producing

00:00:38.730 --> 00:00:42.920 
different to what we have been producing
in<00:00:39.720> past<00:00:40.200> or<00:00:40.710> up<00:00:41.460> to<00:00:41.730> know<00:00:41.850> the<00:00:42.150> analog<00:00:42.780> and

00:00:42.920 --> 00:00:42.930 
in past or up to know the analog and

00:00:42.930 --> 00:00:45.470 
in past or up to know the analog and
digital<00:00:42.990> models<00:00:43.650> so<00:00:44.310> it's<00:00:44.850> totally<00:00:45.090> new

00:00:45.470 --> 00:00:45.480 
digital models so it's totally new

00:00:45.480 --> 00:00:47.930 
digital models so it's totally new
design<00:00:45.690> it's<00:00:46.140> for<00:00:46.950> sure<00:00:47.130> still<00:00:47.610> in<00:00:47.820> the

00:00:47.930 --> 00:00:47.940 
design it's for sure still in the

00:00:47.940 --> 00:00:50.360 
design it's for sure still in the
housing<00:00:48.330> out<00:00:48.450> of<00:00:48.480> open<00:00:48.900> em<00:00:49.050> every<00:00:49.770> lens<00:00:49.950> fits

00:00:50.360 --> 00:00:50.370 
housing out of open em every lens fits

00:00:50.370 --> 00:00:54.500 
housing out of open em every lens fits
as<00:00:50.640> you're<00:00:51.060> used<00:00:51.540> to<00:00:52.550> but<00:00:53.550> we<00:00:54.120> have<00:00:54.270> a<00:00:54.300> new

00:00:54.500 --> 00:00:54.510 
as you're used to but we have a new

00:00:54.510 --> 00:00:58.070 
as you're used to but we have a new
sensor<00:00:54.990> in<00:00:55.140> the<00:00:55.940> one<00:00:56.940> the<00:00:57.270> first<00:00:57.570> part<00:00:57.840> of<00:00:57.930> the

00:00:58.070 --> 00:00:58.080 
sensor in the one the first part of the

00:00:58.080 --> 00:01:01.120 
sensor in the one the first part of the
revolution<00:00:58.620> we<00:00:58.800> have<00:00:58.950> designed<00:00:59.240> ourselves

00:01:01.120 --> 00:01:01.130 
revolution we have designed ourselves

00:01:01.130 --> 00:01:05.090 
revolution we have designed ourselves
with<00:01:02.130> a<00:01:02.160> new<00:01:02.880> European<00:01:03.810> European<00:01:04.439> partners

00:01:05.090 --> 00:01:05.100 
with a new European European partners

00:01:05.100 --> 00:01:08.239 
with a new European European partners
samosas<00:01:05.820> we<00:01:06.479> have<00:01:06.600> designed<00:01:06.840> a<00:01:07.499> new<00:01:07.859> sensor

00:01:08.239 --> 00:01:08.249 
samosas we have designed a new sensor

00:01:08.249 --> 00:01:12.529 
samosas we have designed a new sensor
which<00:01:08.820> is<00:01:09.090> a<00:01:09.539> CMOS<00:01:10.109> sensor<00:01:10.560> 24<00:01:11.130> megapixel<00:01:11.850> so

00:01:12.529 --> 00:01:12.539 
which is a CMOS sensor 24 megapixel so

00:01:12.539 --> 00:01:15.319 
which is a CMOS sensor 24 megapixel so
it's<00:01:12.719> a<00:01:12.810> like<00:01:13.020> max<00:01:13.740> sensor<00:01:14.310> which<00:01:14.789> we<00:01:14.969> call<00:01:15.179> it

00:01:15.319 --> 00:01:15.329 
it's a like max sensor which we call it

00:01:15.329 --> 00:01:17.810 
it's a like max sensor which we call it
and

00:01:17.810 --> 00:01:17.820 

00:01:17.820 --> 00:01:20.840 

yeah<00:01:18.480> so<00:01:18.780> a<00:01:19.050> new<00:01:19.710> sensor<00:01:20.100> in<00:01:20.250> which<00:01:20.580> is<00:01:20.729> the

00:01:20.840 --> 00:01:20.850 
yeah so a new sensor in which is the

00:01:20.850 --> 00:01:24.110 
yeah so a new sensor in which is the
core<00:01:21.090> for<00:01:21.930> sure<00:01:22.050> to<00:01:22.290> take<00:01:22.440> pictures<00:01:22.880> we<00:01:23.880> have<00:01:24.090> a

00:01:24.110 --> 00:01:24.120 
core for sure to take pictures we have a

00:01:24.120 --> 00:01:27.260 
core for sure to take pictures we have a
new<00:01:24.780> newly<00:01:25.440> designed<00:01:25.590> interface<00:01:26.550> on<00:01:26.880> the<00:01:27.060> back

00:01:27.260 --> 00:01:27.270 
new newly designed interface on the back

00:01:27.270 --> 00:01:32.630 
new newly designed interface on the back
so<00:01:28.130> one<00:01:29.130> more<00:01:29.880> button<00:01:30.450> on<00:01:31.080> the<00:01:31.640> photo

00:01:32.630 --> 00:01:32.640 
so one more button on the photo

00:01:32.640 --> 00:01:35.420 
so one more button on the photo
functions<00:01:33.090> we<00:01:33.630> have<00:01:33.990> a<00:01:34.320> new<00:01:34.500> interface<00:01:34.830> and<00:01:35.310> a

00:01:35.420 --> 00:01:35.430 
functions we have a new interface and a

00:01:35.430 --> 00:01:38.540 
functions we have a new interface and a
wheel<00:01:35.700> a<00:01:35.940> sample<00:01:36.479> and<00:01:36.920> also<00:01:37.920> a<00:01:37.950> new<00:01:38.280> monitor

00:01:38.540 --> 00:01:38.550 
wheel a sample and also a new monitor

00:01:38.550 --> 00:01:42.650 
wheel a sample and also a new monitor
with<00:01:39.060> a<00:01:39.090> higher<00:01:39.330> resolution<00:01:39.660> and<00:01:41.509> in<00:01:42.509> the

00:01:42.650 --> 00:01:42.660 
with a higher resolution and in the

00:01:42.660 --> 00:01:46.430 
with a higher resolution and in the
camera<00:01:42.990> itself<00:01:43.140> we<00:01:43.890> have<00:01:44.660> also<00:01:45.660> we<00:01:46.350> are

00:01:46.430 --> 00:01:46.440 
camera itself we have also we are

00:01:46.440 --> 00:01:49.190 
camera itself we have also we are
creating<00:01:46.830> a<00:01:47.280> platform<00:01:47.850> between<00:01:48.420> the

00:01:49.190 --> 00:01:49.200 
creating a platform between the

00:01:49.200 --> 00:01:51.920 
creating a platform between the
different<00:01:49.590> models<00:01:49.800> so<00:01:50.340> we<00:01:50.520> have<00:01:50.729> in<00:01:51.390> the<00:01:51.570> s2

00:01:51.920 --> 00:01:51.930 
different models so we have in the s2

00:01:51.930 --> 00:01:55.389 
different models so we have in the s2
which<00:01:52.890> has<00:01:53.039> been<00:01:53.190> started<00:01:53.810> three<00:01:54.810> years<00:01:54.869> ago

00:01:55.389 --> 00:01:55.399 
which has been started three years ago

00:01:55.399 --> 00:02:00.080 
which has been started three years ago
or<00:01:56.399> lounge<00:01:56.640> for<00:01:57.000> years<00:01:57.210> ago<00:01:57.450> at<00:01:57.930> photokina<00:01:59.090> we

00:02:00.080 --> 00:02:00.090 
or lounge for years ago at photokina we

00:02:00.090 --> 00:02:02.060 
or lounge for years ago at photokina we
had<00:02:00.300> the<00:02:00.420> maestro<00:02:00.930> processor<00:02:01.289> which<00:02:01.530> also<00:02:01.770> is

00:02:02.060 --> 00:02:02.070 
had the maestro processor which also is

00:02:02.070 --> 00:02:05.389 
had the maestro processor which also is
a<00:02:02.100> development<00:02:02.789> from<00:02:03.539> a<00:02:03.750> for<00:02:04.110> leica<00:02:04.380> and<00:02:04.770> this

00:02:05.389 --> 00:02:05.399 
a development from a for leica and this

00:02:05.399 --> 00:02:10.460 
a development from a for leica and this
processor<00:02:05.880> is<00:02:06.030> now<00:02:06.240> in<00:02:07.160> ndm<00:02:08.300> this<00:02:09.300> gives<00:02:10.019> a<00:02:10.200> lot

00:02:10.460 --> 00:02:10.470 
processor is now in ndm this gives a lot

00:02:10.470 --> 00:02:12.830 
processor is now in ndm this gives a lot
of<00:02:10.500> advantages<00:02:11.489> for<00:02:11.730> the<00:02:11.820> m<00:02:11.910> so<00:02:12.120> there<00:02:12.360> is<00:02:12.450> less

00:02:12.830 --> 00:02:12.840 
of advantages for the m so there is less

00:02:12.840 --> 00:02:16.390 
of advantages for the m so there is less
power<00:02:13.140> consumption<00:02:13.620> we<00:02:14.489> have<00:02:14.820> a<00:02:15.360> higher<00:02:15.750> ISO

00:02:16.390 --> 00:02:16.400 
power consumption we have a higher ISO

00:02:16.400 --> 00:02:21.830 
power consumption we have a higher ISO
we<00:02:17.400> have<00:02:17.630> much<00:02:18.630> more<00:02:19.230> much<00:02:20.420> increased<00:02:21.420> speed

00:02:21.830 --> 00:02:21.840 
we have much more much increased speed

00:02:21.840 --> 00:02:25.640 
we have much more much increased speed
in<00:02:22.709> the<00:02:22.860> camera<00:02:23.180> so<00:02:24.180> light<00:02:24.870> speed<00:02:25.200> all<00:02:25.410> but

00:02:25.640 --> 00:02:25.650 
in the camera so light speed all but

00:02:25.650 --> 00:02:28.940 
in the camera so light speed all but
also<00:02:25.830> a<00:02:26.190> picture<00:02:26.700> speed

00:02:28.940 --> 00:02:28.950 
also a picture speed

00:02:28.950 --> 00:02:35.970 
also a picture speed
yeah<00:02:31.080> also<00:02:32.580> the<00:02:34.200> bottom<00:02:35.200> of<00:02:35.380> the<00:02:35.500> camera<00:02:35.650> looks

00:02:35.970 --> 00:02:35.980 
yeah also the bottom of the camera looks

00:02:35.980 --> 00:02:38.820 
yeah also the bottom of the camera looks
different<00:02:36.430> we<00:02:37.090> have<00:02:37.270> an<00:02:37.390> interface<00:02:37.690> I'll<00:02:38.170> talk

00:02:38.820 --> 00:02:38.830 
different we have an interface I'll talk

00:02:38.830 --> 00:02:42.330 
different we have an interface I'll talk
to<00:02:38.890> you<00:02:39.070> later<00:02:39.730> about<00:02:40.390> it<00:02:40.860> for<00:02:41.860> a<00:02:41.890> handgrip

00:02:42.330 --> 00:02:42.340 
to you later about it for a handgrip

00:02:42.340 --> 00:02:45.800 
to you later about it for a handgrip
which<00:02:42.910> has<00:02:43.570> some<00:02:43.840> functionalities<00:02:44.500> we<00:02:45.220> have

00:02:45.800 --> 00:02:45.810 
which has some functionalities we have

00:02:45.810 --> 00:02:49.080 
which has some functionalities we have
the<00:02:46.810> battery<00:02:47.170> of<00:02:47.230> the<00:02:47.410> camera<00:02:48.340> so<00:02:48.880> which<00:02:49.060> is

00:02:49.080 --> 00:02:49.090 
the battery of the camera so which is

00:02:49.090 --> 00:02:52.620 
the battery of the camera so which is
unfortunately<00:02:49.810> not<00:02:49.930> compatible<00:02:51.240> to<00:02:52.240> the

00:02:52.620 --> 00:02:52.630 
unfortunately not compatible to the

00:02:52.630 --> 00:02:57.150 
unfortunately not compatible to the
older<00:02:52.900> models<00:02:53.260> but<00:02:54.210> on<00:02:55.210> the<00:02:55.360> other<00:02:55.420> hand<00:02:56.160> it

00:02:57.150 --> 00:02:57.160 
older models but on the other hand it

00:02:57.160 --> 00:03:00.050 
older models but on the other hand it
gives<00:02:57.550> you<00:02:57.730> a<00:02:57.760> much<00:02:58.330> longer<00:02:58.630> battery<00:02:58.960> life<00:02:59.170> and

00:03:00.050 --> 00:03:00.060 
gives you a much longer battery life and

00:03:00.060 --> 00:03:05.670 
gives you a much longer battery life and
again<00:03:01.060> as<00:03:01.720> only<00:03:02.290> the<00:03:03.100> four<00:03:03.400> models<00:03:04.260> we<00:03:05.260> have<00:03:05.500> an

00:03:05.670 --> 00:03:05.680 
again as only the four models we have an

00:03:05.680 --> 00:03:09.540 
again as only the four models we have an
SD<00:03:06.040> card<00:03:07.230> one<00:03:08.230> more<00:03:08.440> new<00:03:08.980> thing<00:03:09.250> on<00:03:09.460> that

00:03:09.540 --> 00:03:09.550 
SD card one more new thing on that

00:03:09.550 --> 00:03:13.410 
SD card one more new thing on that
camera<00:03:09.970> is<00:03:10.410> we<00:03:11.410> can<00:03:11.800> maybe<00:03:12.070> see<00:03:12.460> it<00:03:12.580> on<00:03:12.760> the<00:03:12.850> on

00:03:13.410 --> 00:03:13.420 
camera is we can maybe see it on the on

00:03:13.420 --> 00:03:16.170 
camera is we can maybe see it on the on
the<00:03:13.480> bottom<00:03:13.810> plate<00:03:14.020> there<00:03:14.620> is<00:03:14.740> a<00:03:14.770> ceiling<00:03:15.220> so

00:03:16.170 --> 00:03:16.180 
the bottom plate there is a ceiling so

00:03:16.180 --> 00:03:18.780 
the bottom plate there is a ceiling so
the<00:03:16.210> camera<00:03:16.660> itself<00:03:16.930> the<00:03:17.440> housing<00:03:17.920> has<00:03:18.490> been

00:03:18.780 --> 00:03:18.790 
the camera itself the housing has been

00:03:18.790 --> 00:03:22.680 
the camera itself the housing has been
protected<00:03:19.390> SDS<00:03:20.020> system<00:03:20.500> against<00:03:21.460> Bray<00:03:21.790> water

00:03:22.680 --> 00:03:22.690 
protected SDS system against Bray water

00:03:22.690 --> 00:03:26.070 
protected SDS system against Bray water
and<00:03:22.960> dust<00:03:23.200> so<00:03:23.710> it's<00:03:23.950> even<00:03:24.940> more<00:03:25.120> rug<00:03:25.390> SDM

00:03:26.070 --> 00:03:26.080 
and dust so it's even more rug SDM

00:03:26.080 --> 00:03:29.460 
and dust so it's even more rug SDM
system<00:03:26.590> has<00:03:26.740> ever<00:03:27.040> been<00:03:27.840> and<00:03:28.840> also<00:03:29.170> all<00:03:29.410> the

00:03:29.460 --> 00:03:29.470 
system has ever been and also all the

00:03:29.470 --> 00:03:34.110 
system has ever been and also all the
housing<00:03:30.040> is<00:03:31.380> it<00:03:32.380> is<00:03:32.740> sealed<00:03:33.340> against<00:03:33.760> spray

00:03:34.110 --> 00:03:34.120 
housing is it is sealed against spray

00:03:34.120 --> 00:03:38.940 
housing is it is sealed against spray
and<00:03:34.240> s<00:03:34.360> yet<00:03:35.200> spray<00:03:35.470> water<00:03:35.680> and<00:03:35.860> dust

00:03:38.940 --> 00:03:38.950 

00:03:38.950 --> 00:03:43.120 

yeah<00:03:39.950> the<00:03:40.460> CMOS<00:03:40.790> sensor<00:03:41.200> gives<00:03:42.200> us<00:03:42.590> the

00:03:43.120 --> 00:03:43.130 
yeah the CMOS sensor gives us the

00:03:43.130 --> 00:03:48.760 
yeah the CMOS sensor gives us the
ability<00:03:43.460> to<00:03:44.420> use<00:03:45.050> live<00:03:45.700> live<00:03:46.700> video<00:03:47.590> to<00:03:48.590> make

00:03:48.760 --> 00:03:48.770 
ability to use live live video to make

00:03:48.770 --> 00:03:51.970 
ability to use live live video to make
videos<00:03:49.310> on<00:03:49.520> a<00:03:49.750> on<00:03:50.750> the<00:03:50.870> camera<00:03:51.200> and<00:03:51.380> also<00:03:51.920> to

00:03:51.970 --> 00:03:51.980 
videos on a on the camera and also to

00:03:51.980 --> 00:03:55.210 
videos on a on the camera and also to
have<00:03:52.190> a<00:03:52.250> live<00:03:52.490> image<00:03:52.880> so<00:03:53.510> if<00:03:53.660> we<00:03:53.840> look<00:03:53.870> at<00:03:54.320> the

00:03:55.210 --> 00:03:55.220 
have a live image so if we look at the

00:03:55.220 --> 00:03:58.630 
have a live image so if we look at the
monitor<00:03:55.610> I<00:03:55.930> know<00:03:56.930> I<00:03:57.080> hope<00:03:57.320> map<00:03:57.560> I<00:03:57.830> have<00:03:58.430> and
