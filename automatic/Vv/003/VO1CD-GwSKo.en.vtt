00:01:25.830 --> 00:01:30.510
 percent of what we consider PMC 

00:01:28.290 --> 00:01:33.840
 is a thyroid disease 

00:01:30.510 --> 00:01:35.070
 what symptoms should go to the doctor 

00:01:33.840 --> 00:01:38.160
 necessarily 

00:01:35.070 --> 00:01:41.730
 apathy insomnia aggressiveness 

00:01:38.160 --> 00:01:43.950
 swelling tachycardia and arrhythmia increase 

00:01:41.730 --> 00:01:46.110
 pressure and the woman who is at this moment 

00:01:43.950 --> 00:01:48.210
 allocation even though there is still 

00:01:46.110 --> 00:01:50.490
 menstruation is not started about what it can 

00:01:48.210 --> 00:01:52.770
 testify menstruation sharply 

00:01:50.490 --> 00:01:54.510
 starts abruptly ends eat 

00:01:52.770 --> 00:01:56.310
 the appearance of bleeding or 

00:01:54.510 --> 00:01:59.100
 blood that appear in two or three days 

00:01:56.310 --> 00:02:00.450
 45 days or after menstruation is a reason 

00:01:59.100 --> 00:02:03.140
 see a doctor 

00:02:00.450 --> 00:02:05.040
 but if it's just mood swings 

00:02:03.140 --> 00:02:08.009
 some kind of nervousness 

00:02:05.040 --> 00:02:11.250
 how to deal with it but very strong connection 

00:02:08.009 --> 00:02:13.349
 occurrence of pms and lifestyle and there are 

00:02:11.250 --> 00:02:16.950
 a clear formula that can not be when PMS 

00:02:13.349 --> 00:02:19.829
 can not coffee salt alcohol in the prevention 

00:02:16.950 --> 00:02:22.439
 catch important is the ability to relax but 

00:02:19.829 --> 00:02:24.930
 this is a warm bath aromatic oils this 

00:02:22.439 --> 00:02:27.989
 massage and probably this attention is male 

00:02:24.930 --> 00:02:31.590
 close friends because often the symptoms 

00:02:27.989 --> 00:02:34.200
 PMS are related to the absence of non- magnesium 

00:02:31.590 --> 00:02:37.019
 that stuff is my miss because of this 

00:02:34.200 --> 00:02:39.239
 gas like a woman suffers when 

00:02:37.019 --> 00:02:40.890
 the woman does not suffer from her less 

00:02:39.239 --> 00:02:42.680
 occur by mass we know what 

00:02:40.890 --> 00:02:46.109
 endorphins i.e. hormones of happiness 

00:02:42.680 --> 00:02:47.879
 pms blocks what we eat what we drink 

00:02:46.109 --> 00:02:49.709
 what do we do to 

00:02:47.879 --> 00:02:53.390
 relieve premenstrual syndrome 

00:02:49.709 --> 00:02:56.849
 we bring ourselves joy and joy 

00:02:53.390 --> 00:02:58.620
 contributes to the disappearance of mild form 

00:02:56.849 --> 00:02:59.280
 besides heavy tms so easy not 

00:02:58.620 --> 00:03:01.889
 get off 

00:02:59.280 --> 00:03:02.639
 here it is necessary and fit poison I took off and 

00:03:01.889 --> 00:03:04.560
 valerian 

00:03:02.639 --> 00:03:08.189
 motherwort sometimes small doses 

00:03:04.560 --> 00:03:09.120
 hypericum work well we salt they in 

00:03:08.189 --> 00:03:11.760
 PMS treatment 

00:03:09.120 --> 00:03:14.099
 special importance is the mode of rest 

00:03:11.760 --> 00:03:17.670
 the ovary is rarely talked about and few people 

00:03:14.099 --> 00:03:20.909
 I know I ask you to remember this is a woman 

00:03:17.670 --> 00:03:23.939
 should sleep at night ovaries should 

00:03:20.909 --> 00:03:26.040
 rest in the dark remember 

00:03:23.939 --> 00:03:27.780
 and use it because the syndrome 

00:03:26.040 --> 00:03:28.950
 early ovarian depletion it now 

00:03:27.780 --> 00:03:31.560
 very popular 

00:03:28.950 --> 00:03:33.810
 disease ovarian exhaustion syndrome and 

00:03:31.560 --> 00:03:35.749
 when a woman at 25 loses 

00:03:33.810 --> 00:03:38.069
 menstruation goes into menopause 

00:03:35.749 --> 00:03:40.859
 healthy sleep is what you need in order 

00:03:38.069 --> 00:03:43.499
 To facilitate KMS is not a secret that during 

00:03:40.859 --> 00:03:44.909
 while pms suffer men sometimes even 

00:03:43.499 --> 00:03:46.590
 kids because we can't 

00:03:44.909 --> 00:03:49.079
 control your emotions 

00:03:46.590 --> 00:03:52.260
 what to advise women and men and 

00:03:49.079 --> 00:03:54.450
 women to be open not to hide 

00:03:52.260 --> 00:03:57.150

00:03:54.450 --> 00:03:59.579
 understanding of your loved ones that you have 

00:03:57.150 --> 00:04:01.799

 man must accept and wash as 

00:04:01.799 --> 00:04:06.659
 surround attention care and maybe 

00:04:04.319 --> 00:04:09.180
 something to replace that is unload dates 

00:04:06.659 --> 00:04:11.790
 possible women rest can be 

00:04:09.180 --> 00:04:13.950
 even better to do some work on 

00:04:11.790 --> 00:04:16.169

 always behave something 

00:04:19.410 --> 00:04:22.699
 and syndrome 

00:04:20.120 --> 00:04:24.620
 pms in the life of a woman will be weaker 

00:04:22.699 --> 00:04:27.020
 man will win because with each 

00:04:24.620 --> 00:04:29.240

 disappear so more often more 

00:04:58.240 --> 00:05:02.840

00:05:02.840 --> 00:05:07.330

00:05:43.849 --> 00:05:47.090
 menstruation or after menstruation 

00:05:45.410 --> 00:05:49.729
 requires medical advice 

00:05:47.090 --> 00:05:51.680
 heating pad categorically without a medical examination 

00:05:49.729 --> 00:05:54.380
 it is impossible because we can be 

00:05:51.680 --> 00:05:56.120
 cysts and fibroids and various diseases 

00:05:54.380 --> 00:05:58.280

 analysis of hormones before menstruation or after 

00:06:07.220 --> 00:06:11.510
 menstruation but it certainly depends on 

00:06:09.770 --> 00:06:13.639
 those hormones that we plan 

00:06:11.510 --> 00:06:15.699
 take if we are talking about a survey 

00:06:13.639 --> 00:06:20.570
 female sex hormones they give up 

00:06:15.699 --> 00:06:23.030
 completely on a special schedule at 7 14 and 

00:06:20.570 --> 00:06:25.520
 21 days from the onset of menstruation 

00:06:23.030 --> 00:06:28.310
 Thyroid hormones are handed 

00:06:25.520 --> 00:06:30.700
 any time period can be excluded 

00:06:28.310 --> 00:06:34.490
 menstruation is not for menstruation 

00:06:30.700 --> 00:06:38.530
 if the difference in the flow of ICP between 

00:06:34.490 --> 00:06:41.450
 giving birth to a woman and giving birth to a woman 

00:06:38.530 --> 00:06:43.370
 There is a difference between giving birth and giving birth 

00:06:41.450 --> 00:06:46.280
 several times giving birth to women 

00:06:43.370 --> 00:06:48.260
 the more times a woman gives birth the less 

00:06:46.280 --> 00:06:50.510
 Symptoms of PMS she will have 

00:06:48.260 --> 00:06:53.330
 but giving birth charity is beneficial 

00:06:50.510 --> 00:06:55.880
 affect the female body for all 

00:06:53.330 --> 00:06:57.610
