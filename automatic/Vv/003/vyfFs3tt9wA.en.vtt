00:00:11.980 --> 00:00:15.680
 red meat really is 

00:00:14.000 --> 00:00:16.910
 indispensable for our diet 

00:00:15.680 --> 00:00:18.830
 or not 

00:00:16.910 --> 00:00:20.630
 red meat as such is not 

00:00:18.830 --> 00:00:22.670
 indispensable as it is not indispensable 

00:00:20.630 --> 00:00:24.170
 poultry or how it is not essential 

00:00:22.670 --> 00:00:26.450
 fish is what they are 

00:00:24.170 --> 00:00:28.340
 proteins are essential and these 

00:00:26.450 --> 00:00:30.140
 can be taken from different sources 

00:00:28.340 --> 00:00:32.960
 red meat is one of those 

00:00:30.140 --> 00:00:35.570
 definitely not better than other sources 

00:00:32.960 --> 00:00:39.770
 as for example the fish that I 

00:00:35.570 --> 00:00:41.809
 I prefer or poultry can be in 

00:00:39.770 --> 00:00:43.370
 part also replaced by the proteins of 

00:00:41.809 --> 00:00:45.230
 vegetable origin such as i 

00:00:43.370 --> 00:00:48.710
 legumes so it's not a question 

00:00:45.230 --> 00:00:50.930
 relative to that specific type of 

00:00:48.710 --> 00:00:52.880
 carnet but rather to be sure of 

00:00:50.930 --> 00:00:56.440
 have adequate protein intake 

00:00:52.880 --> 00:00:59.990
 in the course of the day 

00:00:56.440 --> 00:01:01.910
 I reiterate that when we talk about 

00:00:59.990 --> 00:01:04.040
 food of animal origin what matters 

00:01:01.910 --> 00:01:06.229
 it really is the breeding method 

00:01:04.040 --> 00:01:08.360
 so let's remember once again that 

00:01:06.229 --> 00:01:11.180
 the red meat he has determined 

00:01:08.360 --> 00:01:13.460
 features are subdivided again 

00:01:11.180 --> 00:01:15.530
 but the two types of meat that comes from 

00:01:13.460 --> 00:01:17.659
 animals that graze then bred in 

00:01:15.530 --> 00:01:19.850
 natural way or meat of animals 

00:01:17.659 --> 00:01:22.520
 instead fed with cereals with 

00:01:19.850 --> 00:01:25.760
 intensive methodologies when me 

00:01:22.520 --> 00:01:27.830
 I give cereal to a herbivore is clear 

00:01:25.760 --> 00:01:30.440
 that alters its metabolism and these 

00:01:27.830 --> 00:01:31.970
 alterations are also yes 

00:01:30.440 --> 00:01:33.790
 also affect the quality of 

00:01:31.970 --> 00:01:35.990
 meat we eat then in the case 

00:01:33.790 --> 00:01:38.150
 we want to introduce peak proteins 

00:01:35.990 --> 00:01:39.590
 animal remember that the method of 

00:01:38.150 --> 00:01:43.930
 actually breeding the thing the most 

00:01:39.590 --> 00:01:43.930
 important to select
