00:00:05.990 --> 00:00:06.000 
things to save water you've got a tank

00:00:06.000 --> 00:00:08.330 
things to save water you've got a tank
like<00:00:06.240> this<00:00:06.600> if<00:00:07.140> you<00:00:07.259> use<00:00:07.500> it<00:00:07.680> on<00:00:07.770> your<00:00:07.830> garden

00:00:08.330 --> 00:00:08.340 
like this if you use it on your garden

00:00:08.340 --> 00:00:10.100 
like this if you use it on your garden
but<00:00:08.910> what<00:00:09.059> do<00:00:09.210> you<00:00:09.269> do<00:00:09.450> with<00:00:09.599> your<00:00:09.719> washing

00:00:10.110 --> 00:00:11.900 
but what do you do with your washing
water<00:00:10.290> well<00:00:10.889> some<00:00:11.070> people<00:00:11.370> use<00:00:11.550> it<00:00:11.580> on<00:00:11.759> the

00:00:11.900 --> 00:00:11.910 
water well some people use it on the

00:00:11.910 --> 00:00:15.320 
water well some people use it on the
garden<00:00:12.300> but<00:00:13.230> as<00:00:13.380> you<00:00:13.500> can<00:00:13.650> see<00:00:13.860> here<00:00:14.299> we've<00:00:15.299> got

00:00:15.320 --> 00:00:15.330 
garden but as you can see here we've got

00:00:15.330 --> 00:00:17.480 
garden but as you can see here we've got
a<00:00:15.509> native<00:00:15.929> garden<00:00:16.320> so<00:00:16.529> we<00:00:16.650> really<00:00:16.949> don't<00:00:17.130> need

00:00:17.480 --> 00:00:17.490 
a native garden so we really don't need

00:00:17.490 --> 00:00:36.110 
a native garden so we really don't need
that<00:00:17.850> much<00:00:18.660> water

00:00:36.110 --> 00:00:36.120 

00:00:36.120 --> 00:00:40.140 

what<00:00:37.120> most<00:00:37.300> people<00:00:37.450> do<00:00:37.930> do<00:00:38.530> this<00:00:38.940> you've<00:00:39.940> got<00:00:40.120> a

00:00:40.140 --> 00:00:40.150 
what most people do do this you've got a

00:00:40.150 --> 00:00:43.560 
what most people do do this you've got a
diverter<00:00:40.690> under<00:00:41.200> here<00:00:41.610> if<00:00:42.610> we<00:00:42.790> can<00:00:42.970> see<00:00:43.240> it

00:00:43.560 --> 00:00:43.570 
diverter under here if we can see it

00:00:43.570 --> 00:00:46.680 
diverter under here if we can see it
there's<00:00:44.410> the<00:00:44.620> diverter<00:00:45.100> so<00:00:46.030> we<00:00:46.150> divert<00:00:46.510> it

00:00:46.680 --> 00:00:46.690 
there's the diverter so we divert it

00:00:46.690 --> 00:00:50.670 
there's the diverter so we divert it
outside<00:00:47.850> what<00:00:48.850> actually<00:00:49.000> happens<00:00:49.600> when<00:00:49.870> we

00:00:50.670 --> 00:00:50.680 
outside what actually happens when we

00:00:50.680 --> 00:00:51.830 
outside what actually happens when we
pull<00:00:50.920> the<00:00:51.040> plug

00:00:51.830 --> 00:00:51.840 
pull the plug

00:00:51.840 --> 00:01:12.920 
pull the plug
come<00:00:52.840> on<00:00:52.980> better<00:00:53.980> be<00:00:54.100> quick

00:01:12.920 --> 00:01:12.930 

00:01:12.930 --> 00:01:16.499 

there<00:01:13.930> it<00:01:14.049> is<00:01:14.140> it<00:01:15.130> comes<00:01:15.430> out<00:01:15.700> into<00:01:15.909> this<00:01:16.149> tank

00:01:16.499 --> 00:01:16.509 
there it is it comes out into this tank

00:01:16.509 --> 00:01:21.240 
there it is it comes out into this tank
here<00:01:18.420> this<00:01:19.420> tank<00:01:19.689> you<00:01:19.840> can<00:01:19.960> buy<00:01:20.170> from<00:01:20.439> for

00:01:21.240 --> 00:01:21.250 
here this tank you can buy from for

00:01:21.250 --> 00:01:26.639 
here this tank you can buy from for
about<00:01:21.509> $60<00:01:22.509> in<00:01:22.659> Australia<00:01:24.960> it<00:01:25.960> comes<00:01:26.259> through

00:01:26.639 --> 00:01:26.649 
about $60 in Australia it comes through

00:01:26.649 --> 00:01:30.389 
about $60 in Australia it comes through
this<00:01:26.890> pipe<00:01:27.280> and<00:01:27.610> into<00:01:28.479> the<00:01:28.780> tank<00:01:29.159> one<00:01:30.159> of<00:01:30.280> the

00:01:30.389 --> 00:01:30.399 
this pipe and into the tank one of the

00:01:30.399 --> 00:01:31.950 
this pipe and into the tank one of the
really<00:01:30.670> clever<00:01:30.909> things<00:01:31.240> that<00:01:31.450> I<00:01:31.539> can<00:01:31.720> show<00:01:31.899> you

00:01:31.950 --> 00:01:31.960 
really clever things that I can show you

00:01:31.960 --> 00:01:35.450 
really clever things that I can show you
it<00:01:32.380> is<00:01:32.979> I<00:01:33.130> filter<00:01:33.520> it<00:01:33.549> through<00:01:34.259> pantyhose

00:01:35.450 --> 00:01:35.460 
it is I filter it through pantyhose

00:01:35.460 --> 00:01:38.010 
it is I filter it through pantyhose
because<00:01:36.460> it's<00:01:36.610> very<00:01:36.820> important<00:01:37.420> to<00:01:37.539> have<00:01:37.689> the

00:01:38.010 --> 00:01:38.020 
because it's very important to have the

00:01:38.020 --> 00:01:40.230 
because it's very important to have the
the<00:01:38.679> water<00:01:38.860> as<00:01:39.100> clean<00:01:39.310> as<00:01:39.549> possible

00:01:40.230 --> 00:01:40.240 
the water as clean as possible

00:01:40.240 --> 00:01:41.940 
the water as clean as possible
I<00:01:40.270> should<00:01:40.899> have<00:01:40.990> see<00:01:41.200> it<00:01:41.289> what<00:01:41.470> we're<00:01:41.619> doing

00:01:41.940 --> 00:01:41.950 
I should have see it what we're doing

00:01:41.950 --> 00:01:44.160 
I should have see it what we're doing
with<00:01:42.610> this<00:01:42.759> water<00:01:43.030> is<00:01:43.209> we're<00:01:43.420> using<00:01:43.690> it<00:01:43.959> for

00:01:44.160 --> 00:01:44.170 
with this water is we're using it for

00:01:44.170 --> 00:01:47.370 
with this water is we're using it for
the<00:01:44.229> toilet<00:01:44.619> systems<00:01:45.659> the<00:01:46.659> outlet<00:01:47.020> of<00:01:47.170> this

00:01:47.370 --> 00:01:47.380 
the toilet systems the outlet of this

00:01:47.380 --> 00:01:50.940 
the toilet systems the outlet of this
goes<00:01:48.280> down<00:01:48.580> into<00:01:48.880> this<00:01:49.119> pipe<00:01:49.509> and<00:01:50.049> into<00:01:50.709> this

00:01:50.940 --> 00:01:50.950 
goes down into this pipe and into this

00:01:50.950 --> 00:01:53.010 
goes down into this pipe and into this
pump<00:01:51.310> this<00:01:51.580> costs<00:01:52.119> a<00:01:52.209> little<00:01:52.330> over<00:01:52.630> a<00:01:52.840> hundred

00:01:53.010 --> 00:01:53.020 
pump this costs a little over a hundred

00:01:53.020 --> 00:01:55.949 
pump this costs a little over a hundred
dollars<00:01:53.590> in<00:01:53.770> Australia<00:01:54.340> and<00:01:55.209> it's<00:01:55.509> a<00:01:55.600> special

00:01:55.949 --> 00:01:55.959 
dollars in Australia and it's a special

00:01:55.959 --> 00:01:57.749 
dollars in Australia and it's a special
sort<00:01:56.200> of<00:01:56.259> pump<00:01:56.500> at<00:01:56.649> what's<00:01:56.860> called<00:01:57.190> a<00:01:57.310> positive

00:01:57.749 --> 00:01:57.759 
sort of pump at what's called a positive

00:01:57.759 --> 00:02:00.840 
sort of pump at what's called a positive
displacement<00:01:58.509> pump<00:01:58.750> so<00:01:59.500> it<00:01:59.590> not<00:01:59.740> only<00:01:59.850> pumps

00:02:00.840 --> 00:02:00.850 
displacement pump so it not only pumps

00:02:00.850 --> 00:02:06.859 
displacement pump so it not only pumps
but<00:02:01.810> it<00:02:01.959> always<00:02:02.140> also<00:02:03.360> sucks<00:02:04.360> out<00:02:04.630> of<00:02:04.899> the<00:02:05.049> tank

00:02:06.859 --> 00:02:06.869 
but it always also sucks out of the tank

00:02:06.869 --> 00:02:10.910 
but it always also sucks out of the tank
from<00:02:07.869> here<00:02:08.200> it<00:02:09.190> goes<00:02:09.459> up<00:02:09.729> through<00:02:10.119> this<00:02:10.269> pipe

00:02:10.910 --> 00:02:10.920 
from here it goes up through this pipe

00:02:10.920 --> 00:02:14.910 
from here it goes up through this pipe
into<00:02:11.920> an<00:02:12.310> old<00:02:12.810> garbage<00:02:13.810> container<00:02:14.320> which<00:02:14.620> cost

00:02:14.910 --> 00:02:14.920 
into an old garbage container which cost

00:02:14.920 --> 00:02:17.490 
into an old garbage container which cost
us<00:02:15.070> absolutely<00:02:15.609> nothing<00:02:16.200> notice<00:02:17.200> that<00:02:17.350> we've
