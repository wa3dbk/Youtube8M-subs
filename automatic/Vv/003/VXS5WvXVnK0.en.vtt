 Her voice control is incredible. 

00:03:14.014 --> 00:03:15.974
 &lt;i&gt; My God, Rachel! &lt;/ i&gt; 

00:03:16.275 --> 00:03:19.512
 You have an incredible and powerful future. 

00:03:25.567 --> 00:03:27.087
 Rachel, Rachel, Rachel ... 

00:03:27.963 --> 00:03:30.623
 &lt;i&gt; Where do I start? You are a beast. &lt;/ I&gt; 

00:03:31.377 --> 00:03:32.813
 You're a beast. 

00:03:34.210 --> 00:03:35.020
 Thanks. 

00:03:35.905 --> 00:03:39.835
 I thought he wanted to introduce himself a long time ago. 

00:03:40.008 --> 00:03:41.369
 to show you're right, right? 

00:03:41.725 --> 00:03:44.736
 -Yes. -Yes, you are right. 

00:03:47.793 --> 00:03:49.322
 It is known that the performance is good when I am: 

00:03:49.483 --> 00:03:51.433
 "Can I talk? Can I?" 

00:03:51.697 --> 00:03:53.660
 You have the appearance, 

00:03:53.890 --> 00:03:56.197
 has the best voice I've heard ... 

00:03:57.482 --> 00:04:00.536
 This market is ready for you. 

00:04:07.867 --> 00:04:09.909
 Okay, now we have to vote. 

00:04:10.109 --> 00:04:11.788
 &lt;i&gt; Demi Lovato? &lt;/ i&gt; 

00:04:12.171 --> 00:04:15.804
 The easiest sim I've ever had, in the two seasons of the program. 

00:04:15.965 --> 00:04:16.674
 Thanks. 

00:04:17.594 --> 00:04:18.361
 Paulina? 

00:04:20.062 --> 00:04:20.488
 Thanks. 

00:04:23.579 --> 00:04:25.113
 I'll say yes. 

00:04:29.367 --> 00:04:31.351
 You have four big "yes." 

00:04:48.544 --> 00:04:51.417
 -My God! -My God! My God! 

00:04:52.217 --> 00:04:54.598
 &lt;i&gt; I think I doubted myself a bit. &lt;/ i&gt; 

00:04:54.833 --> 00:04:57.223
 This moment and this hearing, officially valid.
