okay<00:00:03.860> guys<00:00:04.009> it's<00:00:04.220> time<00:00:04.370> for<00:00:04.520> the<00:00:04.609> synapse

00:00:04.960 --> 00:00:04.970 
okay guys it's time for the synapse

00:00:04.970 --> 00:00:07.059 
okay guys it's time for the synapse
build<00:00:05.240> video<00:00:05.569> series<00:00:06.080> gonna<00:00:06.470> start<00:00:06.800> with<00:00:06.950> the

00:00:07.059 --> 00:00:07.069 
build video series gonna start with the

00:00:07.069 --> 00:00:09.070 
build video series gonna start with the
wing<00:00:07.339> and<00:00:07.819> there<00:00:08.149> are<00:00:08.210> two<00:00:08.360> methods<00:00:08.750> for<00:00:08.809> doing

00:00:09.070 --> 00:00:09.080 
wing and there are two methods for doing

00:00:09.080 --> 00:00:11.169 
wing and there are two methods for doing
the<00:00:09.350> wing<00:00:09.530> and<00:00:09.889> I've<00:00:10.250> done<00:00:10.459> detailed<00:00:10.670> videos

00:00:11.169 --> 00:00:11.179 
the wing and I've done detailed videos

00:00:11.179 --> 00:00:13.509 
the wing and I've done detailed videos
on<00:00:11.330> each<00:00:11.509> of<00:00:11.690> those<00:00:11.920> I'm<00:00:12.920> gonna<00:00:13.160> keep<00:00:13.309> them

00:00:27.519 --> 00:00:27.529 
and break down the first method I'll

00:00:27.529 --> 00:00:30.250 
and break down the first method I'll
describe<00:00:27.830> takes<00:00:28.670> a<00:00:28.789> usual<00:00:29.449> stock<00:00:29.810> arm<00:00:30.080> and

00:00:30.250 --> 00:00:30.260 
describe takes a usual stock arm and

00:00:30.260 --> 00:00:32.979 
describe takes a usual stock arm and
wing<00:00:30.380> which<00:00:30.590> is<00:00:30.619> a<00:00:30.740> 30<00:00:31.070> inch<00:00:31.279> span<00:00:31.820> a<00:00:32.119> 9<00:00:32.780> inch

of the wing tip and the wing route

00:00:43.850 --> 00:00:46.259 
of the wing tip and the wing route
respectively<00:00:44.540> so<00:00:45.229> that<00:00:45.379> you<00:00:45.500> end<00:00:45.680> up<00:00:45.799> with

00:00:46.259 --> 00:00:46.269 
respectively so that you end up with

00:00:46.269 --> 00:00:49.630 
respectively so that you end up with
this<00:00:47.269> then<00:00:47.930> at<00:00:48.049> that<00:00:48.140> point<00:00:48.440> the<00:00:48.739> spar<00:00:49.369> is

00:00:49.630 --> 00:00:49.640 
this then at that point the spar is

00:00:49.640 --> 00:00:51.369 
this then at that point the spar is
threaded<00:00:50.119> through<00:00:50.420> the<00:00:50.449> wings<00:00:50.780> and<00:00:51.080> the<00:00:51.170> wings

00:00:51.369 --> 00:00:51.379 
threaded through the wings and the wings

00:00:51.379 --> 00:00:53.530 
threaded through the wings and the wings
are<00:00:51.530> united<00:00:52.070> this<00:00:52.580> is<00:00:52.699> the<00:00:52.820> hard<00:00:53.000> part<00:00:53.059> getting

00:00:53.530 --> 00:00:53.540 
are united this is the hard part getting

00:00:53.540 --> 00:00:56.350 
are united this is the hard part getting
the<00:00:53.750> spar<00:00:54.290> in<00:00:54.530> but<00:00:55.070> if<00:00:55.190> you're<00:00:55.850> a<00:00:55.879> builder<00:00:56.180> who

00:00:56.350 --> 00:00:56.360 
the spar in but if you're a builder who

00:00:56.360 --> 00:00:58.450 
the spar in but if you're a builder who
can<00:00:56.570> put<00:00:57.170> together<00:00:57.290> an<00:00:57.559> arm<00:00:57.710> and<00:00:57.860> wing<00:00:57.979> really

00:00:58.450 --> 00:00:58.460 
can put together an arm and wing really

00:00:58.460 --> 00:01:00.579 
can put together an arm and wing really
quick<00:00:58.699> in<00:00:59.000> your<00:00:59.239> sleep<00:00:59.629> or<00:00:59.960> you've<00:01:00.350> got<00:01:00.559> some

00:01:00.579 --> 00:01:00.589 
quick in your sleep or you've got some

00:01:00.589 --> 00:01:02.289 
quick in your sleep or you've got some
already<00:01:01.010> built<00:01:01.250> and<00:01:01.430> you<00:01:01.489> want<00:01:01.670> to<00:01:01.760> adapt<00:01:02.119> it

00:01:02.289 --> 00:01:02.299 
already built and you want to adapt it

00:01:02.299 --> 00:01:03.910 
already built and you want to adapt it
for<00:01:02.479> the<00:01:02.570> synapse<00:01:02.960> this<00:01:03.290> is<00:01:03.409> probably<00:01:03.739> the

00:01:03.910 --> 00:01:03.920 
for the synapse this is probably the

00:01:03.920 --> 00:01:05.049 
for the synapse this is probably the
build<00:01:04.129> technique<00:01:04.519> for<00:01:04.729> you

00:01:05.049 --> 00:01:05.059 
build technique for you

00:01:05.059 --> 00:01:06.609 
build technique for you
this<00:01:05.479> method<00:01:05.810> also<00:01:05.869> works<00:01:06.170> great<00:01:06.290> if<00:01:06.530> you

00:01:06.609 --> 00:01:06.619 
this method also works great if you

00:01:06.619 --> 00:01:08.650 
this method also works great if you
happen<00:01:06.950> to<00:01:06.979> have<00:01:07.130> a<00:01:07.160> radial<00:01:07.490> arm<00:01:07.670> saw<00:01:07.730> or<00:01:08.180> miter

00:01:08.650 --> 00:01:08.660 
happen to have a radial arm saw or miter

00:01:08.660 --> 00:01:10.210 
happen to have a radial arm saw or miter
saw<00:01:08.990> which<00:01:09.230> is<00:01:09.350> great<00:01:09.560> for<00:01:09.890> cutting<00:01:09.980> these

00:01:10.210 --> 00:01:10.220 
saw which is great for cutting these

00:01:10.220 --> 00:01:12.160 
saw which is great for cutting these
angles<00:01:10.580> and<00:01:10.730> also<00:01:11.420> particularly<00:01:11.960> if<00:01:12.050> you<00:01:12.140> have

00:01:12.160 --> 00:01:12.170 
angles and also particularly if you have

00:01:12.170 --> 00:01:15.160 
angles and also particularly if you have
a<00:01:12.320> metal<00:01:13.160> arrow<00:01:13.490> shaft<00:01:14.330> they<00:01:14.570> can<00:01:14.750> use<00:01:14.900> for<00:01:15.110> the

00:01:15.160 --> 00:01:15.170 
a metal arrow shaft they can use for the

00:01:15.170 --> 00:01:17.740 
a metal arrow shaft they can use for the
coring<00:01:15.650> process<00:01:16.520> that<00:01:16.910> creates<00:01:17.270> the<00:01:17.390> channel

00:01:17.740 --> 00:01:17.750 
coring process that creates the channel

00:01:17.750 --> 00:01:19.990 
coring process that creates the channel
through<00:01:18.050> the<00:01:18.080> wing<00:01:18.320> for<00:01:19.130> the<00:01:19.160> spar<00:01:19.580> but<00:01:19.910> you

00:01:19.990 --> 00:01:20.000 
through the wing for the spar but you

00:01:20.000 --> 00:01:21.400 
through the wing for the spar but you
can<00:01:20.150> actually<00:01:20.420> use<00:01:20.540> a<00:01:20.570> carbon<00:01:20.810> arrow<00:01:21.050> too<00:01:21.260> as

00:01:21.400 --> 00:01:21.410 
can actually use a carbon arrow too as

00:01:21.410 --> 00:01:22.570 
can actually use a carbon arrow too as
I've<00:01:21.560> done<00:01:21.710> with<00:01:22.190> this<00:01:22.340> one

00:01:22.570 --> 00:01:22.580 
I've done with this one

00:01:22.580 --> 00:01:24.520 
I've done with this one
the<00:01:23.060> second<00:01:23.390> method<00:01:23.480> I'll<00:01:23.720> describe<00:01:23.990> entails

00:01:24.520 --> 00:01:24.530 
the second method I'll describe entails

00:01:24.530 --> 00:01:27.130 
the second method I'll describe entails
taking<00:01:25.070> a<00:01:25.280> piece<00:01:25.670> of<00:01:25.850> pre-taped<00:01:26.360> Dollar<00:01:27.050> Tree

00:01:27.130 --> 00:01:27.140 
taking a piece of pre-taped Dollar Tree

00:01:27.140 --> 00:01:30.120 
taking a piece of pre-taped Dollar Tree
foam<00:01:27.530> board<00:01:27.800> two<00:01:28.790> colors<00:01:29.120> if<00:01:29.270> you<00:01:29.390> like<00:01:29.420> and

00:01:30.120 --> 00:01:30.130 
foam board two colors if you like and

00:01:30.130 --> 00:01:33.220 
foam board two colors if you like and
cuts<00:01:31.130> a<00:01:31.310> wedge<00:01:31.550> off<00:01:31.820> the<00:01:32.210> root<00:01:32.540> of<00:01:32.780> the<00:01:33.050> lower

00:01:33.220 --> 00:01:33.230 
cuts a wedge off the root of the lower

surface of the wing first to establish
the<00:01:35.570> sweep<00:01:35.810> angle<00:01:36.020> then<00:01:36.710> the<00:01:36.920> entire<00:01:37.280> wing<00:01:37.520> is

00:01:37.660 --> 00:01:37.670 
the sweep angle then the entire wing is

00:01:37.670 --> 00:01:40.090 
the sweep angle then the entire wing is
constructed<00:01:38.300> around<00:01:38.420> that<00:01:38.840> angle<00:01:39.260> so<00:01:40.010> go

00:01:40.090 --> 00:01:40.100

Synapse<00:01:49.070> wing<00:01:49.250> of<00:01:49.850> all<00:01:50.030> my<00:01:50.150> designs<00:01:50.510> so<00:01:50.810> far<00:01:51.110> I

00:01:51.130 --> 00:01:51.140 
Synapse wing of all my designs so far I

00:01:51.140 --> 00:01:52.810 
Synapse wing of all my designs so far I
think<00:01:51.320> that<00:01:51.710> the<00:01:51.800> synapse<00:01:52.190> is<00:01:52.370> the<00:01:52.520> most

00:01:52.810 --> 00:01:52.820 
think that the synapse is the most

00:01:52.820 --> 00:01:54.600 
think that the synapse is the most
amenable<00:01:53.420> to<00:01:53.479> improvements<00:01:54.380> and

00:01:54.600 --> 00:01:54.610 
amenable to improvements and

00:01:54.610 --> 00:01:57.070 
amenable to improvements and
modifications<00:01:55.610> in<00:01:55.729> the<00:01:55.850> build<00:01:56.060> process<00:01:56.210> so<00:01:56.659> by

00:01:57.070 --> 00:01:57.080 
modifications in the build process so by

00:01:57.080 --> 00:01:58.360 
modifications in the build process so by
all<00:01:57.290> means<00:01:57.530> if<00:01:57.680> you<00:01:57.740> see<00:01:57.950> a<00:01:57.979> better<00:01:58.130> way<00:01:58.340> of

00:01:58.360 --> 00:01:58.370 
all means if you see a better way of

00:01:58.370 --> 00:02:00.940 
all means if you see a better way of
doing<00:01:58.580> something<00:01:59.120> in<00:01:59.270> the<00:01:59.750> process<00:02:00.200> do<00:02:00.590> it<00:02:00.740> and

just<00:03:24.950> thought<00:03:25.100> the<00:03:25.280> extra<00:03:25.730> work<00:03:25.940> might<00:03:26.360> not<00:03:26.540> be

00:03:26.680 --> 00:03:26.690 
just thought the extra work might not be

00:03:26.690 --> 00:03:28.480 
just thought the extra work might not be
worth<00:03:26.900> it<00:03:27.110> if<00:03:27.290> you<00:03:27.440> are<00:03:27.530> particularly<00:03:27.920> adept

00:03:28.480 --> 00:03:28.490 
worth it if you are particularly adept

00:03:28.490 --> 00:03:31.150 
worth it if you are particularly adept
at<00:03:28.730> such<00:03:29.060> geometry<00:03:29.660> the<00:03:30.470> tapered<00:03:30.770> wing<00:03:30.890> might

00:03:31.150 --> 00:03:31.160 
at such geometry the tapered wing might

00:03:31.160 --> 00:03:31.930 
at such geometry the tapered wing might
be<00:03:31.310> good<00:03:31.490> for<00:03:31.520> you

00:03:31.930 --> 00:03:31.940 
be good for you

00:03:31.940 --> 00:03:35.260 
be good for you

00:03:35.260 --> 00:03:35.270 
simplicity probably the synapse is a

00:03:35.270 --> 00:03:37.180 
simplicity probably the synapse is a

wing<00:03:42.500> and<00:03:42.740> we<00:03:43.670> simply<00:03:44.030> make<00:03:44.180> do<00:03:44.330> by<00:03:44.510> flying<00:03:44.780> a

wing and we simply make do by flying a
little<00:03:45.110> bit<00:03:45.230> faster<00:03:45.650> so<00:03:45.920> far<00:03:46.490> I'm<00:03:46.580> finding

00:03:46.900 --> 00:03:46.910 
little bit faster so far I'm finding

00:03:46.910 --> 00:03:49.510 
little bit faster so far I'm finding
even<00:03:47.030> with<00:03:47.300> a<00:03:47.330> straight<00:03:47.690> wing<00:03:47.840> no<00:03:48.560> washout<00:03:49.010> no

even with a straight wing no washout no
implicit<00:03:49.850> reflex<00:03:50.360> that<00:03:50.600> this<00:03:50.720> is<00:03:50.810> very<00:03:50.959> easy

00:03:51.250 --> 00:03:51.260 
implicit reflex that this is very easy

00:03:51.260 --> 00:03:52.780 
implicit reflex that this is very easy
to<00:03:51.470> build<00:03:51.590> a<00:03:51.740> wing<00:03:51.890> and<00:03:52.070> it<00:03:52.160> flies<00:03:52.310> actually

00:03:52.780 --> 00:03:52.790 
to build a wing and it flies actually

00:03:52.790 --> 00:03:55.330 
to build a wing and it flies actually
plenty<00:03:53.360> well<00:03:53.750> and<00:03:54.020> you<00:03:54.770> can't<00:03:54.980> beat<00:03:55.100> it<00:03:55.220> for

00:03:55.330 --> 00:03:55.340 
plenty well and you can't beat it for

00:03:55.340 --> 00:03:57.430 
plenty well and you can't beat it for
the<00:03:55.430> price<00:03:55.670> so<00:03:56.360> this<00:03:56.450> is<00:03:56.570> two<00:03:57.020> pieces<00:03:57.410> of

00:03:57.430 --> 00:03:57.440 
the price so this is two pieces of

00:03:57.440 --> 00:03:59.380 
the price so this is two pieces of
dietary<00:03:57.920> foam<00:03:58.160> board<00:03:58.430> one<00:03:58.850> more<00:03:59.060> for<00:03:59.300> the

and some odds and ends tape and glue is

00:04:04.130 --> 00:04:06.220 
and some odds and ends tape and glue is
probably<00:04:04.550> under<00:04:04.760> $10<00:04:05.420> most<00:04:05.720> of<00:04:05.840> the<00:04:05.900> time<00:04:06.050> to

00:04:06.220 --> 00:04:06.230 
probably under $10 most of the time to

00:04:06.230 --> 00:04:07.690 
probably under $10 most of the time to
build<00:04:06.350> this<00:04:06.500> plane<00:04:06.770> so<00:04:07.160> the<00:04:07.280> sequence<00:04:07.520> of

00:04:07.690 --> 00:04:07.700 
build this plane so the sequence of

build this plane so the sequence of
videos<00:04:07.820> I'll<00:04:08.240> do<00:04:08.480> our<00:04:08.720> first<00:04:09.530> constructing

00:04:10.300 --> 00:04:10.310

the<00:04:10.430> wing<00:04:10.640> airfoil<00:04:11.209> itself<00:04:11.660> either<00:04:11.870> of<00:04:12.110> the

00:04:13.750 --> 00:04:13.760 
two methods you can skip to that as you

00:04:13.760 --> 00:04:16.720 
two methods you can skip to that as you
like<00:04:14.530> then<00:04:15.530> a<00:04:15.560> follow-up<00:04:16.010> video<00:04:16.250> will<00:04:16.580> include

00:04:16.720 --> 00:04:16.730 
like then a follow-up video will include

00:04:16.730 --> 00:04:18.940 
like then a follow-up video will include
installing<00:04:17.299> the<00:04:17.570> servos<00:04:17.989> and<00:04:18.200> linking<00:04:18.709> up<00:04:18.830> the

control surfaces with control Lawrence

00:04:21.340 --> 00:04:25.120 
control surfaces with control Lawrence
then<00:04:22.340> I'll<00:04:22.460> do<00:04:22.610> the<00:04:22.730> fuselage<00:04:23.270> in<00:04:24.050> a<00:04:24.560> video<00:04:24.860> and

00:04:25.120 --> 00:04:25.130 
then I'll do the fuselage in a video and

00:04:25.130 --> 00:04:27.520 
then I'll do the fuselage in a video and
finally<00:04:25.850> the<00:04:26.240> vertical<00:04:26.600> stabilizers<00:04:27.290> and

00:04:30.490 --> 00:04:30.500 
it up for flight

00:04:30.500 --> 00:04:32.350 
it up for flight
