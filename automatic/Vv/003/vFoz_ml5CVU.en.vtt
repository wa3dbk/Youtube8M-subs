00:00:06.610 --> 00:00:10.000
 hello roleros welcome to the new video 

00:00:08.470 --> 00:00:12.760
 Today I'm here to tell you about a game 

00:00:10.000 --> 00:00:15.340
 that I love the call of catulus of 

00:00:12.760 --> 00:00:17.440
 sant and pedersen undoubtedly one of those 

00:00:15.340 --> 00:00:19.030
 jewels that are out there in the world of 

00:00:17.440 --> 00:00:21.369
 RPGs and I had so many 

00:00:19.030 --> 00:00:26.770
 I want to review this edition that I manage 

00:00:21.369 --> 00:00:29.440
 I'm the one in 1998 is version 5.5 and the 

00:00:26.770 --> 00:00:31.060
 Take out the factory of ideas with a samsung 

00:00:29.440 --> 00:00:32.980
 it's a pretty good edition but not 

00:00:31.060 --> 00:00:35.260
 I know if it will be easy to get it I leave you 

00:00:32.980 --> 00:00:36.910
 here the cover for you to see it you will see 

00:00:35.260 --> 00:00:38.590
 that if you buy other versions like 

00:00:36.910 --> 00:00:41.079
 that is what is right now 

00:00:38.590 --> 00:00:42.640
 prime has another cover is more 

00:00:41.079 --> 00:00:44.350
 updated well that we report a 

00:00:42.640 --> 00:00:46.329
 shortly before taking an edition or 

00:00:44.350 --> 00:00:48.310
 another one to me personally I love 

00:00:46.329 --> 00:00:50.739
 As for the price this book is a 

00:00:48.310 --> 00:00:53.230
 little bit expensive is worth 45 euros for 

00:00:50.739 --> 00:00:55.540
 internet the new pressures that there are and 

00:00:53.230 --> 00:00:57.670
 if you buy it in pdf it will have to be 

00:00:55.540 --> 00:01:00.130
 in English for 19 euros and I could not find 

00:00:57.670 --> 00:01:01.720
 something else so good a little expensive 

00:01:00.130 --> 00:01:04.719
 a little hard to get maybe 

00:01:01.720 --> 00:01:06.579
 but essential as I say a game 

00:01:04.719 --> 00:01:08.649
 that I really wanted to review in 

00:01:06.579 --> 00:01:10.810
 As for the format, the book comes on top 

00:01:08.649 --> 00:01:12.250
 hard are 303 pages with which is 

00:01:10.810 --> 00:01:14.290
 passing information 

00:01:12.250 --> 00:01:15.790
 but it's all black and white so 

00:01:14.290 --> 00:01:17.800
 if you really like the illustrations and 

00:01:15.790 --> 00:01:19.120
 others this game does not call me 

00:01:17.800 --> 00:01:20.890
 especially the attention and I do not 

00:01:19.120 --> 00:01:22.900
 it seems to be the most spectacular 

00:01:20.890 --> 00:01:25.210
 after pointing out if you ever do not see 

00:01:22.900 --> 00:01:27.160
 animals and such the bestiary in short 

00:01:25.210 --> 00:01:28.660
 that is not a brutal game because of the fact 

00:01:27.160 --> 00:01:31.630
 of his illustrations but by the 

00:01:28.660 --> 00:01:33.700
 content has an index at the beginning and 

00:01:31.630 --> 00:01:36.160
 another one at the end that helps us organize 

00:01:33.700 --> 00:01:39.850
 quite the information come you can to 

00:01:36.160 --> 00:01:41.470
 book comes with a lot of examples of 

00:01:39.850 --> 00:01:44.020
 games and also of characters the 

00:01:41.470 --> 00:01:45.880
 players with which is very very very 

00:01:44.020 --> 00:01:47.380
 interesting how is this 

00:01:45.880 --> 00:01:49.240
 game in terms of setting the 

00:01:47.380 --> 00:01:51.610
 call of catches a little bit all the 

00:01:49.240 --> 00:01:54.130
 work of lovecraft and transforms it 

00:01:51.610 --> 00:01:56.770
 little bit to adapt it to a role play 

00:01:54.130 --> 00:02:00.280
 so that is set in his work and 

00:01:56.770 --> 00:02:02.110
 if you like what horror is 

00:02:00.280 --> 00:02:04.210
 atmospheres has been a bit oppressive if 

00:02:02.110 --> 00:02:05.649
 This game is going to enchant you 

00:02:04.210 --> 00:02:07.360
 that we will embody another game will be a 

00:02:05.649 --> 00:02:09.220
 researcher who makes a series of 

00:02:07.360 --> 00:02:12.640
 progressive discoveries throughout 

00:02:09.220 --> 00:02:15.190
 of his life on the world of myths 

00:02:12.640 --> 00:02:17.739
 of title if you want to call it that and 

00:02:15.190 --> 00:02:18.730
 Well, about some disturbing facts that 

00:02:17.739 --> 00:02:21.159
 are happening 

00:02:18.730 --> 00:02:23.019
 has as a request to discover 

00:02:21.159 --> 00:02:24.730
 investigate our researcher how much 

00:02:23.019 --> 00:02:26.830
 the more you discover the more you know about those 

00:02:24.730 --> 00:02:28.629
 myths of champion less sanity will be left 

00:02:26.830 --> 00:02:30.640
 more what is achieved and probably 

00:02:28.629 --> 00:02:32.349
 will end up in a madhouse or dead like 

00:02:30.640 --> 00:02:33.610
 we will see later also decides the 

00:02:32.349 --> 00:02:35.620
 invitation that can be played in the era 

00:02:33.610 --> 00:02:37.090
 Victorian can be played in the 20s 

00:02:35.620 --> 00:02:39.580
 or even today if you fancy 

00:02:37.090 --> 00:02:41.379
 in terms of content I have to say 

00:02:39.580 --> 00:02:44.349
 that at the beginning can be a 

00:02:41.379 --> 00:02:47.500
 little overwhelming to understand everything 

00:02:44.349 --> 00:02:50.230
 he wrote it and it is collected in this manual 

00:02:47.500 --> 00:02:52.269
 that involves creating an investigation for 

00:02:50.230 --> 00:02:55.239
 generate a game that supposed to be 

00:02:52.269 --> 00:02:57.329
 investigator how are the 

00:02:55.239 --> 00:03:00.579
 discoveries et cetera etcetera but 

00:02:57.329 --> 00:03:02.290
 it's really a game that at the beginning 

00:03:00.579 --> 00:03:04.150
 you can address it in a very 

00:03:02.290 --> 00:03:05.500
 simple is a research of the most 

00:03:04.150 --> 00:03:06.879
 simple or follow the examples themselves 

00:03:05.500 --> 00:03:08.890
 that come to you in the manual that you have 

00:03:06.879 --> 00:03:10.359
 a few examples of starting and little 

00:03:08.890 --> 00:03:12.819
 to little go complicating it go 

00:03:10.359 --> 00:03:14.950
 enriching the system is governed by the 

00:03:12.819 --> 00:03:16.599
 given of 100 that is we have a series 

00:03:14.950 --> 00:03:19.209
 of feature abilities 

00:03:16.599 --> 00:03:21.129
 we make a roll if we get less than 

00:03:19.209 --> 00:03:23.169
 what we have on a scale from 1 to 

00:03:21.129 --> 00:03:24.220
 100 well a success or a failure 

00:03:23.169 --> 00:03:25.870
 I want to sing 

00:03:24.220 --> 00:03:28.360
 to clarify that the flame of your 

00:03:25.870 --> 00:03:32.410
 character usually as he discovers 

00:03:28.360 --> 00:03:34.390
 because the overwhelming reality that is 

00:03:32.410 --> 00:03:36.370
 out there will be losing little by little 

00:03:34.390 --> 00:03:39.130
 the reason or rather it will go 

00:03:36.370 --> 00:03:41.230
 understanding things and that makes you 

00:03:39.130 --> 00:03:43.690
 go crazy then your researcher 

00:03:41.230 --> 00:03:46.450
 anxiety will end up going crazy and with 

00:03:43.690 --> 00:03:47.860
 the time you will have to remove it but what 

00:03:46.450 --> 00:03:49.510
 normal is that people and especially 

00:03:47.860 --> 00:03:51.670
 the extra players who are released 

00:03:49.510 --> 00:03:53.380
 to investigate how crazy and that does not have in 

00:03:51.670 --> 00:03:55.480
 account that the myths of cthulhu are 

00:03:53.380 --> 00:03:57.330
 dangerous usually end up dead in this 

00:03:55.480 --> 00:03:59.980
 game dies quite often 

00:03:57.330 --> 00:04:00.959
 then considering if you like 

00:03:59.980 --> 00:04:03.100
 the games in which the characters 

00:04:00.959 --> 00:04:06.850
 they last a long time so the call 

00:04:03.100 --> 00:04:08.830
 catullo demands to have that touch not of a 

00:04:06.850 --> 00:04:10.300
 good investigator to not finish dead 

00:04:08.830 --> 00:04:12.700
 prematurely 

00:04:10.300 --> 00:04:14.140
 the assessment of course I have to 

00:04:12.700 --> 00:04:16.510
 say that you can not be impartial because 

00:04:14.140 --> 00:04:19.330
 This game I love is one of my 

00:04:16.510 --> 00:04:22.060
 favorites I think the atmosphere that 

00:04:19.330 --> 00:04:24.450
 presents is amazing and I think all the 

00:04:22.060 --> 00:04:26.590
 work of lovecraft that is collected is 

00:04:24.450 --> 00:04:29.560
 present in the role play in a way 

00:04:26.590 --> 00:04:33.280
 very interesting and especially I like 

00:04:29.560 --> 00:04:35.620
 the fact that that madness is integrated and 

00:04:33.280 --> 00:04:38.290
 that different approach to the universe 

00:04:35.620 --> 00:04:39.970
 and the laws of our world and I 

00:04:38.290 --> 00:04:42.250
 it seems very original that then to me 

00:04:39.970 --> 00:04:44.230
 I like very much especially the fact 

00:04:42.250 --> 00:04:45.520
 that the whole game is going to investigate 

00:04:44.230 --> 00:04:48.310
 that you are a researcher and you have to 

00:04:45.520 --> 00:04:50.470
 discover things then how is it from 

00:04:48.310 --> 00:04:52.120
 represent and less than throw dice the 

00:04:50.470 --> 00:04:53.470
 high catullo I love to weigh 

00:04:52.120 --> 00:04:55.360
 that at the beginning a 

00:04:53.470 --> 00:04:56.500
 little overwhelming to all the information yes 

00:04:55.360 --> 00:04:58.389
 that it is true that the call of catulo 

00:04:56.500 --> 00:05:01.139
 it's an ideal game to start people 

00:04:58.389 --> 00:05:03.190
 in the role and it seems very easy 

00:05:01.139 --> 00:05:05.530
 represent a researcher 

00:05:03.190 --> 00:05:07.270
 it seems very affordable then in that 

00:05:05.530 --> 00:05:08.560
 meaning if you have not played this game and 

00:05:07.270 --> 00:05:10.300
 are you looking for real game to start 

00:05:08.560 --> 00:05:11.860
 the riva de cátulo may be an option 

00:05:10.300 --> 00:05:13.360
 fantastic in terms of aspects 

00:05:11.860 --> 00:05:15.190
 negative I have to say that it is a 

00:05:13.360 --> 00:05:18.400
 book that costs at first to get him 

00:05:15.190 --> 00:05:21.010
 all the juice that demands a maturity 

00:05:18.400 --> 00:05:23.229
 as a player or as a game director and 

00:05:21.010 --> 00:05:25.540
 At the same time, I think it's a 

00:05:23.229 --> 00:05:27.250
 little expensive not paying 40 euros for a 

00:05:25.540 --> 00:05:29.020
 role play is worth the flame of 

00:05:27.250 --> 00:05:31.330
 Cátulo is a great game and at level 

00:05:29.020 --> 00:05:33.930
 so much to have it but I recognize that it can 

00:05:31.330 --> 00:05:33.930
 be a little 

00:05:33.950 --> 00:05:37.820
 I do not know how complicated it is for some pockets 

00:05:36.020 --> 00:05:39.410
 because they are almost 50 euros per game of 

00:05:37.820 --> 00:05:41.090
 role that is said fast also the fact 

00:05:39.410 --> 00:05:43.820
 that I do not have a pdf in Spanish 

00:05:41.090 --> 00:05:45.590
 It seems unfortunate and terrible someone 

00:05:43.820 --> 00:05:47.840
 I should solve it and have to 

00:05:45.590 --> 00:05:50.150
 pay 19 euros for the version of the pdf in 

00:05:47.840 --> 00:05:51.530
 English is even more surreal if you 

00:05:50.150 --> 00:05:52.910
 liked the video do not forget to give 

00:05:51.530 --> 00:05:54.530
 I like you can leave me a comment 

00:05:52.910 --> 00:05:56.300
 with your doubts and do not forget 

00:05:54.530 --> 00:05:58.520
 subscribe to the channel us among your 

00:05:56.300 --> 00:06:00.379
 videos chao 

00:05:58.520 --> 00:06:02.090
 as a last observation I would like 

00:06:00.379 --> 00:06:04.039
 say that having an anthology of 

00:06:02.090 --> 00:06:06.860
 the work of lovecraft is highly recommended 

00:06:04.039 --> 00:06:08.870
 to play the call catullo also 

00:06:06.860 --> 00:06:10.940
 the guardian or game director in this 

00:06:08.870 --> 00:06:12.919
 case you have things like this guide at hand 

00:06:10.940 --> 00:06:15.259
 of monsters that suits you very well for 

00:06:12.919 --> 00:06:16.940
 understand a little bit better than poking and 

00:06:15.259 --> 00:06:19.129
 not to put in a game 

00:06:16.940 --> 00:06:22.280
 The more you know the deeper you go 

00:06:19.129 --> 00:06:23.629
 in your room and its contents better 

00:06:22.280 --> 00:06:24.860
 they will be our games and more 

00:06:23.629 --> 00:06:26.360
 interesting investigations 

00:06:24.860 --> 00:06:27.650
 results also say that in some 

00:06:26.360 --> 00:06:30.370
 occasion I and my friends have tried 

00:06:27.650 --> 00:06:30.370
 invoke cátulo 

00:06:31.240 --> 00:06:34.360
 to date but if I get it I will 

00:06:33.160 --> 00:06:37.590
 upload a youtube tutorial so that 

00:06:34.360 --> 00:06:37.590
 you can invoke it also from home
