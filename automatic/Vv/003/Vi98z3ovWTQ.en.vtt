triple trees

00:01:49.740 --> 00:01:52.440 
triple trees
we'll<00:01:50.740> start<00:01:50.950> by<00:01:51.100> removing<00:01:51.399> the<00:01:51.579> front<00:01:52.000> fender

00:01:52.440 --> 00:01:52.450 
we'll start by removing the front fender

00:01:52.450 --> 00:01:54.990 
we'll start by removing the front fender
as<00:01:52.659> well<00:01:52.930> as<00:01:53.140> the<00:01:53.320> brake<00:01:53.560> calipers<00:01:54.100> and<00:01:54.130> next

00:01:54.990 --> 00:01:55.000 
as well as the brake calipers and next

00:01:55.000 --> 00:01:57.120 
as well as the brake calipers and next
we'll<00:01:55.149> need<00:01:55.299> that<00:01:55.509> 16<00:01:56.110> millimeter<00:01:56.530> or<00:01:56.770> five

00:01:57.120 --> 00:01:57.130 
we'll need that 16 millimeter or five

00:01:57.130 --> 00:01:59.850 
we'll need that 16 millimeter or five
eighths<00:01:57.340> hex<00:01:58.119> socket<00:01:58.329> to<00:01:59.020> remove<00:01:59.049> the<00:01:59.590> front

00:02:05.880 --> 00:02:05.890 
well now that we have all that out of

00:02:05.890 --> 00:02:07.859 
well now that we have all that out of
the<00:02:05.950> way<00:02:05.979> we<00:02:06.250> can<00:02:06.430> take<00:02:06.580> a<00:02:06.610> look<00:02:06.880> at<00:02:07.060> the<00:02:07.360> triple

00:02:07.859 --> 00:02:07.869 
the way we can take a look at the triple

00:02:07.869 --> 00:02:10.139 
the way we can take a look at the triple
trees<00:02:08.170> and<00:02:08.590> you'll<00:02:08.979> loosen<00:02:09.220> the<00:02:09.520> triple<00:02:09.970> tree

00:02:10.139 --> 00:02:10.149 
trees and you'll loosen the triple tree

00:02:10.149 --> 00:02:12.180 
trees and you'll loosen the triple tree
bolts<00:02:10.539> the<00:02:10.990> three<00:02:11.200> of<00:02:11.230> them<00:02:11.440> are<00:02:11.530> shown<00:02:11.740> here

00:02:12.180 --> 00:02:12.190 
bolts the three of them are shown here

and if you have any difficulty getting
the<00:02:15.040> the<00:02:15.819> fork<00:02:16.120> loose<00:02:16.510> when<00:02:16.900> you<00:02:16.990> really

00:02:17.280 --> 00:02:17.290 
the the fork loose when you really

00:02:17.290 --> 00:02:19.890 
the the fork loose when you really
attempt<00:02:17.680> to<00:02:17.770> rotate<00:02:18.190> that<00:02:18.400> out<00:02:18.640> of<00:02:18.819> the<00:02:19.030> triple

00:02:19.890 --> 00:02:19.900 
attempt to rotate that out of the triple

00:02:19.900 --> 00:02:22.170 
attempt to rotate that out of the triple
trees<00:02:20.110> you<00:02:20.319> can<00:02:20.500> use<00:02:20.800> a<00:02:20.830> small<00:02:21.250> screwdriver<00:02:21.280> in

00:02:22.170 --> 00:02:22.180 
trees you can use a small screwdriver in

00:02:22.180 --> 00:02:24.330 
trees you can use a small screwdriver in
the<00:02:22.270> slots<00:02:22.600> of<00:02:22.780> the<00:02:22.870> triple<00:02:23.230> tree<00:02:23.440> to<00:02:24.190> be<00:02:24.280> able

00:02:24.330 --> 00:02:24.340 
the slots of the triple tree to be able

00:02:24.340 --> 00:02:26.910 
the slots of the triple tree to be able
to<00:02:24.520> expand<00:02:24.940> it<00:02:25.120> very<00:02:25.360> slightly<00:02:25.750> to<00:02:26.590> take<00:02:26.770> the

00:02:26.910 --> 00:02:26.920 
to expand it very slightly to take the

00:02:26.920 --> 00:02:30.540 
to expand it very slightly to take the
pressure<00:02:27.160> off<00:02:27.340> of<00:02:27.760> the<00:02:28.200> the<00:02:29.200> fork<00:02:29.530> and<00:02:29.770> it'll

00:02:30.540 --> 00:02:30.550 
pressure off of the the fork and it'll

00:02:30.550 --> 00:02:34.050 
pressure off of the the fork and it'll
slip<00:02:30.760> right<00:02:31.000> out<00:02:31.060> of<00:02:31.270> the<00:02:31.420> triple<00:02:31.750> tree<00:02:33.060> okay

00:02:34.050 --> 00:02:34.060 
slip right out of the triple tree okay

00:02:34.060 --> 00:02:36.030 
slip right out of the triple tree okay
we've<00:02:34.480> got<00:02:34.660> one<00:02:34.840> fork<00:02:35.140> removed<00:02:35.470> and<00:02:35.739> you<00:02:35.860> want

00:02:36.030 --> 00:02:36.040 
we've got one fork removed and you want

00:02:36.040 --> 00:02:38.100 
we've got one fork removed and you want

00:05:23.739 --> 00:05:23.749 
ability i think it really improves the

00:05:23.749 --> 00:05:26.709 
ability i think it really improves the
stance<00:05:24.169> of<00:05:24.319> the<00:05:24.439> bike<00:05:25.029> and<00:05:26.029> of<00:05:26.180> course<00:05:26.210> chrome

00:05:26.709 --> 00:05:26.719 
stance of the bike and of course chrome

00:05:26.719 --> 00:05:28.540
