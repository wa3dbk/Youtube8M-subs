 This lyce 0 

00:00:03.930 --> 00:00:12.210
 I think I want to do a button hole in the Brother's electronic rice 

00:00:08.010 --> 00:00:17.790
 Change the buttonhole to this button method labor accident 

00:00:12.210 --> 00:00:19.110
 I will say one race It is by now comes with here Hano scale this is one centimeter increments 

00:00:17.790 --> 00:00:23.810
 10 centimeters 

00:00:19.110 --> 00:00:25.870
 A buttonhole with a width of up to 3 cm can be sewn 

00:00:23.810 --> 00:00:30.510
 I'm writing 

00:00:25.870 --> 00:00:32.740
 When taking a picture of this standard hold, press the back button. 

00:00:30.510 --> 00:00:39.360
 Will replace 

00:00:32.740 --> 00:00:39.360
 And there is this stick, but this stick fits this center 

00:00:40.440 --> 00:00:47.040
 Are combined and lowered 

00:00:43.740 --> 00:00:49.610
 It is here when attached will take 

00:00:47.040 --> 00:00:52.010
 When you put on it will feel like giving 

00:00:49.610 --> 00:00:56.780
 Then I want to do it 

00:00:52.010 --> 00:00:59.700
 It's a design but it's a buttonhole I'm going to type a and b 

00:00:56.780 --> 00:01:00.970
 First paint a then paint b 

00:00:59.700 --> 00:01:04.430
 It will be that important 

00:01:00.970 --> 00:01:09.430
 At that time the seam length 

00:01:04.430 --> 00:01:09.430
 I will make f 0.5 people. 

00:01:09.550 --> 00:01:14.590
 I'm doing 

00:01:12.150 --> 00:01:17.000
 Where you want to ride 

00:01:14.590 --> 00:01:19.100
 Even unhappy 

00:01:17.000 --> 00:01:23.810
 Leave 50 

00:01:19.100 --> 00:01:26.470
 There will follow from this up to 1 cm 2 cm 3 cm, which will continue to make a behind 

00:01:23.810 --> 00:01:28.120
 Where is 2 centimeters 

00:01:26.470 --> 00:01:29.890
 I want to do it 

00:01:28.120 --> 00:01:32.729
 Then let's start 

00:01:29.890 --> 00:01:32.729
 I will 

00:01:36.700 --> 00:01:43.730
 Stop at this in centimeters then switch to t 

00:01:41.070 --> 00:01:43.730
 Hmm 

00:01:45.900 --> 00:01:49.030
 It is an experienced person 

00:01:47.810 --> 00:01:52.960
 Stop 

00:01:49.030 --> 00:01:54.670
 Yes this is the button 

00:01:52.960 --> 00:02:01.159
 I saw 

00:01:54.670 --> 00:02:05.180
 Since this is a ripper here, I made this 2 cm button book when I made a hole 

00:02:01.159 --> 00:02:09.159
 I would like to do only how to open what you have and how to open it 

00:02:05.180 --> 00:02:09.159
 If you take it high with coins etc. 

00:02:09.539 --> 00:02:15.370
 Get out 

00:02:11.840 --> 00:02:21.490
 When it should be here for safety 

00:02:15.370 --> 00:02:26.700
 Please be sure to cut it . There is a risk of injury if it is accidentally touched . 

00:02:21.490 --> 00:02:26.700
 I will tell you this kind of Harry in coins 

00:02:30.840 --> 00:02:35.240
 So I do that 

00:02:32.970 --> 00:02:35.240
 A little 

00:02:36.410 --> 00:02:42.569
 I will do a stick bottle 

00:02:40.010 --> 00:02:46.790
 It is like this 

00:02:42.569 --> 00:02:48.030
 I will continue to calculate just a little electricity 

00:02:46.790 --> 00:02:51.500
 Other 

00:02:48.030 --> 00:02:52.430
 With a brush this kind of place is when cleaning is in this kind of wind 

00:02:51.500 --> 00:02:56.800
 High 

00:02:52.430 --> 00:02:59.030
 There will also be sediment here and will coat it later 

00:02:56.800 --> 00:03:01.630
 Wipe with a dry cloth 

00:02:59.030 --> 00:03:06.940
 Then when I close this 

00:03:01.630 --> 00:03:09.300
 It is sunny stove eyes of the individual parts which to fit in here I'd have become a spring 

00:03:06.940 --> 00:03:09.300
 To 

00:03:09.460 --> 00:03:16.870
 I will put this up here 

00:03:13.300 --> 00:03:18.750
 It feels like I'm jealous. It is no good to talk to this 

00:03:16.870 --> 00:03:22.550
 Be sure to light it up 

00:03:18.750 --> 00:03:22.550
 Will close the leader 

00:03:22.960 --> 00:03:28.210
 Take care of the screw with a freeter 

00:03:29.230 --> 00:03:35.549
 And it ends with kina more than you may left and right I It was felt
