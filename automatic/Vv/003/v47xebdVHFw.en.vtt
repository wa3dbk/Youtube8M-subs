 hello good afternoon my name is julieta forero I am the teacher I foresee or for 

00:00:29.359 --> 00:00:30.649
 Latin America 

00:00:30.649 --> 00:00:36.809
 this afternoon I bring you the very simple step by step of painting and Syrian which 

00:00:36.809 --> 00:00:40.010
 we will perform in just four phases 

00:00:40.010 --> 00:00:41.820
 to start 

00:00:41.820 --> 00:00:48.010
 We use a spleen in which we normally take in house 9 in any 

00:00:48.010 --> 00:00:51.900
 kind of glass and I did it we infected lion alcohol 

00:00:54.420 --> 00:00:59.450
 it must be taken into account that the piece must be very well disinfected 

00:00:59.450 --> 00:01:04.550
 to allow the painting to be left because of wounds in a more peace way 

00:01:06.750 --> 00:01:10.730
 once we have synthesized the pregnancy with a sponge 

00:01:12.480 --> 00:01:15.410
 we are going to use two colors 

00:01:15.410 --> 00:01:18.740
 we started 

00:01:18.740 --> 00:01:22.570
 mutiny could do once checked that on the top 

00:01:25.380 --> 00:01:28.730
 thus 

00:01:28.730 --> 00:01:34.410
 in this same way we incorporate the other color also making a small 

00:01:34.410 --> 00:01:37.650
 motivated 

00:01:37.650 --> 00:01:40.650
 throughout the area 

00:01:45.270 --> 00:01:51.100
 we are doing the combination of the two colors we can mix in this case 

00:01:51.100 --> 00:01:54.100
 I'm using a green color 

00:01:55.060 --> 00:01:58.109
 olive green i an orange color 

00:01:59.380 --> 00:02:04.869
 to facilitate us better we can enter the hand inside the glass 

00:02:09.819 --> 00:02:15.019
 if the work with him as nuanced hard work allows us to cover the 

00:02:15.019 --> 00:02:19.430
 surface suddenly for people who are not very skilled in handling 

00:02:19.430 --> 00:02:24.099
 of the brush we can achieve it perfectly with a foam 

00:02:24.099 --> 00:02:27.099
 this work allows us to cover the entire surface 

00:02:28.069 --> 00:02:30.869
 thus 

00:02:30.869 --> 00:02:35.219
 we suddenly avoided doing the work step with the brush 

00:02:41.589 --> 00:02:45.029
 then and I already have applied to my painting 

00:02:45.029 --> 00:02:48.039
 in this way of josé khan 

00:02:48.039 --> 00:02:52.209
 at room temperature twenty minutes to go to the decoration 

00:02:53.209 --> 00:02:57.180
 once we let the room temperature dry for 20 minutes 

00:02:57.180 --> 00:02:59.969
 we started the decoration step 

00:02:59.969 --> 00:03:03.349
 with a client was a card-smoking man 

00:03:03.349 --> 00:03:06.459
 then he comes to try to make some irregular shapes 

00:03:12.059 --> 00:03:14.589
 in this way 

00:03:14.589 --> 00:03:17.589
 trying to do 

00:03:19.689 --> 00:03:21.439
 an Andalusian accent 

00:03:21.439 --> 00:03:24.439
 to then apply the rimmed 

00:03:26.099 --> 00:03:29.259
 cc embroiderer is an incalculable edger 

00:03:31.019 --> 00:03:35.839
 i started to apply in an irregular way 

00:03:35.839 --> 00:03:38.799
 until get 

00:03:38.799 --> 00:03:40.639
 the desired texture 

00:03:40.639 --> 00:03:46.120
 and in this case we decorate the whole piece in this way to obtain a 

00:03:46.119 --> 00:03:48.539
 result like this 

00:03:48.539 --> 00:03:49.749
 once 

00:03:49.749 --> 00:03:51.619
 it's already decorated 

00:03:51.619 --> 00:03:58.359
 We totally let the piece dry for 24 hours and the ant mostapha 170 degrees 

00:03:58.359 --> 00:04:01.759
 now forty minutes in home ovens 

00:04:01.759 --> 00:04:06.869
 the water based paints are not toxic and we can still take them 

00:04:06.869 --> 00:04:08.429
 conventional 

00:04:08.429 --> 00:04:12.819
 i after that the mozart room nothing or we can take in them are tricks that 

00:04:12.819 --> 00:04:18.189
 can use daily for your public for hotels is simply a 

00:04:18.189 --> 00:04:19.999
 decoration object 

00:04:19.999 --> 00:04:25.319
 that breaks the scheme of the painting to the furnace to thousand 800 wounded freed 

00:04:26.340 --> 00:04:30.530
 for more information if you have here if you have any doubts about this step to
