00:00:09.250 --> 00:00:12.580
 hello people follow me the clumsy and I'll 

00:00:11.170 --> 00:00:15.160
 I bring some tutorials this time 

00:00:12.580 --> 00:00:17.710
 minecraft gone wrong called chicken chance 

00:00:15.160 --> 00:00:19.750
 mod what is this good mode for? 

00:00:17.710 --> 00:00:22.540
 mod is useful so that even if you go to 

00:00:19.750 --> 00:00:24.250
 fifth pine in your house where you have 

00:00:22.540 --> 00:00:26.289
 the aparatejo of this here that is the 

00:00:24.250 --> 00:00:28.630
 what brings you the mod things follow 

00:00:26.289 --> 00:00:31.000
 working to see I explain the 

00:00:28.630 --> 00:00:33.430
 minecraft is formed by chung un-chan 

00:00:31.000 --> 00:00:37.140
 as I understand it is a little plot 

00:00:33.430 --> 00:00:39.340
 of 16 blocks by 16 background blocks 

00:00:37.140 --> 00:00:42.969
 down I think they are 200 and peak 

00:00:39.340 --> 00:00:44.739
 blocks and good what about these jones 

00:00:42.969 --> 00:00:46.960
 because when the world had a ago 

00:00:44.739 --> 00:00:48.280
 teams appear because you do not believe 

00:00:46.960 --> 00:00:49.690
 absolutely everyone from minecraft 

00:00:48.280 --> 00:00:52.840
 because then there would be no computer that 

00:00:49.690 --> 00:00:54.489
 will support it, I believe, and what happens is 

00:00:52.840 --> 00:00:55.809
 that according to you you are moving because there 

00:00:54.489 --> 00:00:57.850
 a certain amount of chung 

00:00:55.809 --> 00:00:59.890
 around you that are moving is 

00:00:57.850 --> 00:01:02.110
 say where you are is they plan zombies 

00:00:59.890 --> 00:01:04.660
 grow the plants reproduce the 

00:01:02.110 --> 00:01:06.729
 animals but far away away from where 

00:01:04.660 --> 00:01:08.259
 you are the world is standing on its 

00:01:06.729 --> 00:01:09.759
 six we have a lot of good because 

00:01:08.259 --> 00:01:12.009
 we have our house assembled we put 

00:01:09.759 --> 00:01:13.540
 here in the furnaces to melt metal we 

00:01:12.009 --> 00:01:15.040
 Let's go explore and when we come back 

00:01:13.540 --> 00:01:16.750
 we see that the ovens have not advanced 

00:01:15.040 --> 00:01:18.760
 absolutely nothing has cast us the 

00:01:16.750 --> 00:01:20.920
 metal and the animals that we had had 

00:01:18.760 --> 00:01:22.600
 to raise little ones are still tiny 

00:01:20.920 --> 00:01:24.670
 and they do not grow and our garden continues 

00:01:22.600 --> 00:01:26.140
 exactly as we leave it this should be 

00:01:24.670 --> 00:01:27.790
 to what I say of the chips that when 

00:01:26.140 --> 00:01:29.020
 that is, we move away from things 

00:01:27.790 --> 00:01:31.210
 when we move away from this part of the 

00:01:29.020 --> 00:01:33.250
 map the guys stop loading and it's 

00:01:31.210 --> 00:01:34.600
 as if time stopped and for 

00:01:33.250 --> 00:01:36.700
 that serves this way the chicken church's 

00:01:34.600 --> 00:01:39.400
 mode is for us to put 

00:01:36.700 --> 00:01:41.829
 this aparatejo here we decide a radio 

00:01:39.400 --> 00:01:44.049
 determined is a zonita des 

00:01:41.829 --> 00:01:46.270
 Champs where you will continue to load 

00:01:44.049 --> 00:01:47.050
 lotion will continue the time advancing 

00:01:46.270 --> 00:01:50.080
 although we 

00:01:47.050 --> 00:01:51.550
 in this area how do you use this good 

00:01:50.080 --> 00:01:53.680
 first that how is it used let's 

00:01:51.550 --> 00:01:56.260
 learn to see how the following is done 

00:01:53.680 --> 00:01:58.240
 model with an enchantment table 

00:01:56.260 --> 00:02:00.040
 with gold ingots and with a pearl of 

00:01:58.240 --> 00:02:01.480
 leander would give us the chung loader and 

00:02:00.040 --> 00:02:03.340
 then we have the little version les 

00:02:01.480 --> 00:02:05.140
 another to see what is done with a pimp 

00:02:03.340 --> 00:02:07.590
 adhered surrounded by pearls should see that 

00:02:05.140 --> 00:02:10.810
 they are not at least I have trouble following 

00:02:07.590 --> 00:02:13.030
 the problem of spot sounders that I see 

00:02:10.810 --> 00:02:14.380
 and when I give it with the right button to 

00:02:13.030 --> 00:02:16.120
 I do not think any window nor 

00:02:14.380 --> 00:02:19.060
 no menu to say anything then I 

00:02:16.120 --> 00:02:21.570
 I think the aparatejo this you can not 

00:02:19.060 --> 00:02:24.460
 decide how many chung you want to load 

00:02:21.570 --> 00:02:26.260
 but it is based on those that you 

00:02:24.460 --> 00:02:27.790
 put the big one and as if I'm big 

00:02:26.260 --> 00:02:29.410
 by we give you right click of the mouse and 

00:02:27.790 --> 00:02:32.260
 we get this little window with our 

00:02:29.410 --> 00:02:35.790
 name and cool to radio this is going to be 

00:02:32.260 --> 00:02:40.270
 the radio here we will load 9 sounds 25 

00:02:35.790 --> 00:02:42.970
 49 81 important here we can see show 

00:02:40.270 --> 00:02:45.040
 lasers we give you and we see the links is 

00:02:42.970 --> 00:02:47.320
 saying where these links go is 

00:02:45.040 --> 00:02:49.990
 where the kids are going to be 

00:02:47.320 --> 00:02:51.910
 Carrying even if we are not 

00:02:49.990 --> 00:02:53.650
 or they will teach the radio that will load 

00:02:51.910 --> 00:02:56.800
 that is the circumference that is going to be 

00:02:53.650 --> 00:02:59.230
 where will you charge each chung you 

00:02:56.800 --> 00:03:02.740
 we give to remove them because it is not flat and 

00:02:59.230 --> 00:03:05.260
 then it would be here 81 that is to say taking 

00:03:02.740 --> 00:03:07.150
 this as center around 81 

00:03:05.260 --> 00:03:08.950
 they are going to be carrying absolutely 

00:03:07.150 --> 00:03:10.450
 always although we are not what 

00:03:08.950 --> 00:03:11.920
 which means that we are going to be able to leave 

00:03:10.450 --> 00:03:14.290
 home to explore and do what the 

00:03:11.920 --> 00:03:15.970
 win and our machinery will continue 

00:03:14.290 --> 00:03:17.170
 running the plants are going to continue 

00:03:15.970 --> 00:03:19.420
 growing the garden will continue 

00:03:17.170 --> 00:03:20.320
 expanding and the animals go to 

00:03:19.420 --> 00:03:22.750
 keep growing 

00:03:20.320 --> 00:03:24.400
 this is very much like I say of those who 

00:03:22.750 --> 00:03:26.860
 you have to install always walking and 

00:03:24.400 --> 00:03:28.570
 I always install it because it saves a 

00:03:26.860 --> 00:03:30.250
 lots of time and has no de jos you're 

00:03:28.570 --> 00:03:31.630
 out there thinking that the garden is not going 

00:03:30.250 --> 00:03:32.530
 to grow up that when I go back I'll 

00:03:31.630 --> 00:03:34.900
 you are going to find is everything exactly 

00:03:32.530 --> 00:03:37.660
 you left it like that, I do not expect anything 

00:03:34.900 --> 00:03:39.040
 I have served this module, I put 

00:03:37.660 --> 00:03:40.510
 I will leave in the description the page for 

00:03:39.040 --> 00:03:43.330
 download what 

00:03:40.510 --> 00:03:45.189
 and nothing as they always say that it has 

00:03:43.330 --> 00:03:46.209
 seemed like it's been useful to me 

00:03:45.189 --> 00:03:49.200
 I hope so and see you in the 

00:03:46.209 --> 00:03:49.200
 next good video
