00:01:58.509 --> 00:02:00.570 
really to high up and I'm just really
doing<00:01:58.750> this<00:01:58.869> very<00:01:59.170> very<00:01:59.409> lightly<00:01:59.740> because<00:02:00.130> I

00:02:00.570 --> 00:02:00.580 
doing this very very lightly because I

00:02:00.580 --> 00:02:02.819 
doing this very very lightly because I
don't<00:02:00.850> want<00:02:01.060> too<00:02:01.570> much<00:02:01.780> product<00:02:02.229> to<00:02:02.500> come<00:02:02.680> on

00:02:02.819 --> 00:02:02.829 
don't want too much product to come on

00:02:02.829 --> 00:02:04.889 
don't want too much product to come on
to<00:02:03.009> my<00:02:03.100> eyes<00:02:03.250> another<00:02:03.939> thing<00:02:04.270> is<00:02:04.479> is<00:02:04.720> that

00:02:04.889 --> 00:02:04.899 
to my eyes another thing is is that

00:02:04.899 --> 00:02:06.630 
to my eyes another thing is is that
because<00:02:04.990> this<00:02:05.259> is<00:02:05.320> continuous<00:02:06.039> airflow<00:02:06.429> and

00:02:06.630 --> 00:02:06.640 
because this is continuous airflow and

00:02:06.640 --> 00:02:09.059 
because this is continuous airflow and
there's<00:02:06.789> constantly<00:02:07.360> air<00:02:07.630> coming<00:02:07.899> out<00:02:08.140> if<00:02:08.530> you

00:02:09.059 --> 00:02:09.069 
there's constantly air coming out if you

00:02:09.069 --> 00:02:10.529 
there's constantly air coming out if you
do<00:02:09.280> put<00:02:09.429> a<00:02:09.489> little<00:02:09.700> bit<00:02:09.819> too<00:02:09.940> much<00:02:10.060> on<00:02:10.269> and<00:02:10.450> it

00:02:10.529 --> 00:02:10.539 
do put a little bit too much on and it

00:02:10.539 --> 00:02:12.570 
do put a little bit too much on and it
still<00:02:10.750> has<00:02:10.899> kind<00:02:11.140> of<00:02:11.170> a<00:02:11.290> wet<00:02:11.500> look<00:02:11.769> you<00:02:12.400> can

00:02:12.570 --> 00:02:12.580 
still has kind of a wet look you can

00:02:12.580 --> 00:02:14.850 
still has kind of a wet look you can
just<00:02:12.760> go<00:02:12.940> over<00:02:12.970> your<00:02:13.630> eyelid<00:02:14.260> without

00:02:18.390 --> 00:02:18.400 
touching the lever at all and then it'll

00:02:18.400 --> 00:02:20.759 
touching the lever at all and then it'll

that<00:05:43.260> you<00:05:43.350> want<00:05:43.380> because<00:05:43.860> sometimes<00:05:44.280> there's

00:05:44.450 --> 00:05:44.460 
that you want because sometimes there's

00:05:44.460 --> 00:05:45.980

something on it
it<00:06:48.720> would<00:06:48.870> work<00:06:48.960> too<00:06:49.200> another<00:06:50.010> thing<00:06:50.250> you<00:06:50.340> can

and it'll kind of create a brow
highlight<00:07:08.930> and<00:07:09.930> it<00:07:10.140> can<00:07:10.470> also<00:07:10.710> be<00:07:11.040> used<00:07:11.220> to
