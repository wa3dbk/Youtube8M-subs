00:00:23.240 --> 00:00:28.020
 we try a good mix 

00:00:25.920 --> 00:00:29.520
 theoretical contents theoretical 

00:00:28.020 --> 00:00:30.990
 knowledge transfer and practical 

00:00:29.520 --> 00:00:32.940
 to keep content 

00:00:30.990 --> 00:00:33.690
 that's easy they can 

00:00:32.940 --> 00:00:36.000
 imagine that the 

00:00:33.690 --> 00:00:37.920
 leadership experience not in one 

00:00:36.000 --> 00:00:39.720
 but can teach the theory course 

00:00:37.920 --> 00:00:42.780
 You must learn the way you can 

00:00:39.720 --> 00:00:45.559
 in practical exercises in simulation 

00:00:42.780 --> 00:00:46.680
 Exercises that offer themselves here primarily 

00:00:45.559 --> 00:00:49.110
 realize 

00:00:46.680 --> 00:00:50.970
 It is important for us to be in these 

00:00:49.110 --> 00:00:52.559
 exercises also the stress of a real life 

00:00:50.970 --> 00:00:55.860
 use situation to try 

00:00:52.559 --> 00:00:58.230
 simulate the mass seizure of 

00:00:55.860 --> 00:01:00.480
 the injured or ill must 

00:00:58.230 --> 00:01:02.160
 Senior Emergency Doctor Three Strategic Goals 

00:01:00.480 --> 00:01:05.249
 to consider in his other 

00:01:02.160 --> 00:01:06.869
 that's the first strategic goal as well 

00:01:05.249 --> 00:01:08.999
 In the attack of many injured and 

00:01:06.869 --> 00:01:10.709
 at the same time the same disease 

00:01:08.999 --> 00:01:13.499
 supply quality must be achieved 

00:01:10.709 --> 00:01:16.560
 as with the individual emergency that 

00:01:13.499 --> 00:01:18.539
 second is that must make sure that 

00:01:16.560 --> 00:01:20.819
 injured at the many 

00:01:18.539 --> 00:01:22.529
 Use the patient first 

00:01:20.819 --> 00:01:24.179
 the hardest to deal with 

00:01:22.529 --> 00:01:26.399
 hurt are the most urgent 

00:01:24.179 --> 00:01:29.249
 need treatment and the third 

00:01:26.399 --> 00:01:32.249
 point is that by feeding the 

00:01:29.249 --> 00:01:33.950
 Patients in hospitals the chaos of 

00:01:32.249 --> 00:01:36.709
 not in the hospitals 

00:01:33.950 --> 00:01:38.849
 is transmitted when we have a 

00:01:36.709 --> 00:01:40.740
 confused situation with one 

00:01:38.849 --> 00:01:42.329
 unknown number of patients 

00:01:40.740 --> 00:01:43.889
 to make the right decision, namely 

00:01:42.329 --> 00:01:45.959
 the decision of which patient as 

00:01:43.889 --> 00:01:48.270
 first to be supplied so which 

00:01:45.959 --> 00:01:49.740
 patient treatment has priority and 

00:01:48.270 --> 00:01:51.509
 I just do not get irritated by 

00:01:49.740 --> 00:01:53.429
 The patients cry the loudest 

00:01:51.509 --> 00:01:54.419
 but his work towards it 

00:01:53.429 --> 00:01:56.189
 concentrate the patients 

00:01:54.419 --> 00:01:57.659
 to filter out our help on 

00:01:56.189 --> 00:01:59.489
 need and as many as possible 

00:01:57.659 --> 00:02:02.370
 Patients to survive 

00:01:59.489 --> 00:02:05.340
 the students of rezke 

00:02:02.370 --> 00:02:08.040
 are the future leaders of the 

00:02:05.340 --> 00:02:11.250
 Rescue service the executives 

00:02:08.040 --> 00:02:13.260
 Know what your staff can do on the spot 

00:02:11.250 --> 00:02:16.050
 Must know that 

00:02:13.260 --> 00:02:18.390
 demands on the staff on her 

00:02:16.050 --> 00:02:21.180
 to come to rescue and that should 

00:02:18.390 --> 00:02:24.000
 our rescue engineers in the future 

00:02:21.180 --> 00:02:25.770
 better organize better organize 

00:02:24.000 --> 00:02:28.500
 from my point of view is the combination 

00:02:25.770 --> 00:02:32.160
 between the experienced people from the 

00:02:28.500 --> 00:02:33.710
 Medicine with students of a college 

00:02:32.160 --> 00:02:34.770
 maybe they too 

00:02:33.710 --> 00:02:36.320
 additional qualifications such as 

00:02:34.770 --> 00:02:39.240
 organizational ladder rescue service 

00:02:36.320 --> 00:02:42.420
 gain in the course of their development 

00:02:39.240 --> 00:02:45.290
 can be an excellent symbiosis order 

00:02:42.420 --> 00:02:48.030
 a deployment of diverse and 

00:02:45.290 --> 00:02:49.220
 known structures the best possible 

00:02:48.030 --> 00:02:51.750
 extract 

00:02:49.220 --> 00:02:54.840
 the chief emergency doctor for the 

00:02:51.750 --> 00:02:56.310
 medical care in charge of this 

00:02:54.840 --> 00:02:57.870
 But now they have to imagine that way 

00:02:56.310 --> 00:02:59.640
 that he does not even hand to the 

00:02:57.870 --> 00:03:01.710
 patient but that he is the 

00:02:59.640 --> 00:03:05.100
 best possible individual medical 

00:03:01.710 --> 00:03:07.620
 care of the patients is organized there 

00:03:05.100 --> 00:03:09.950
 also simple rescue service 

00:03:07.620 --> 00:03:13.290
 situation with several injured 

00:03:09.950 --> 00:03:18.180
 Often hooks and grommets have it too 

00:03:13.290 --> 00:03:20.969
 solve it applies before the injured 

00:03:18.180 --> 00:03:23.790
 pay range of 50 to 100 thinks so 

00:03:20.969 --> 00:03:26.040
 in the mass accident of injured is the 

00:03:23.790 --> 00:03:28.859
 situation to work off very similar 

00:03:26.040 --> 00:03:29.989
 but she also has to be at lower 

00:03:28.859 --> 00:03:32.939
 pay 

00:03:29.989 --> 00:03:35.310
 we practice a lot of practice 

00:03:32.939 --> 00:03:36.810
 the entire course only by a lecture 

00:03:35.310 --> 00:03:38.280
 then train in a practice exercise 

00:03:36.810 --> 00:03:40.349
 like practice on the basis of different 

00:03:38.280 --> 00:03:41.700
 patients we represent the 

00:03:40.349 --> 00:03:43.200
 make right decisions and 

00:03:41.700 --> 00:03:44.879
 exactly these patients 

00:03:43.200 --> 00:03:46.950
 filter out and how it goes the red 

00:03:44.879 --> 00:03:48.659
 Patients the vitally threatened patients 

00:03:46.950 --> 00:03:50.549
 who now need emergency order 

00:03:48.659 --> 00:03:52.650
 each no further harm to take 

00:03:50.549 --> 00:03:53.239
 then work off the job adequately 

00:03:52.650 --> 00:03:56.069
 to be able to 

00:03:53.239 --> 00:03:57.659
 from the of the structure of the inserts 

00:03:56.069 --> 00:04:00.030
 i found it i found it very well done 

00:03:57.659 --> 00:04:01.439
 just too different damage 

00:04:00.030 --> 00:04:03.719
 I personally choose that as very 

00:04:01.439 --> 00:04:05.909
 felt positive was just the 

00:04:03.719 --> 00:04:08.280
 possibility but actually once 

00:04:05.909 --> 00:04:10.379
 out possibility to stab themselves all 

00:04:08.280 --> 00:04:13.169
 use too let's see where you yet 

00:04:10.379 --> 00:04:14.760
 really like information 

00:04:13.169 --> 00:04:16.470
 easy to arrive and also what time 

00:04:14.760 --> 00:04:18.750
 information arrives and that has me 

00:04:16.470 --> 00:04:21.389
 personally yet again very motivated 

00:04:18.750 --> 00:04:22.770
 also to say i just have to 

00:04:21.389 --> 00:04:24.630
 faster and more targeted 

00:04:22.770 --> 00:04:26.220
 Information also to the control center 

00:04:24.630 --> 00:04:28.500
 bring that together as well 

00:04:26.220 --> 00:04:28.970
 even faster ultimately work 

00:04:28.500 --> 00:04:32.669
 can 

00:04:28.970 --> 00:04:34.260
 in bus accidents, we not only need 

00:04:32.669 --> 00:04:36.090
 Emergency doctor at the place of application the 

00:04:34.260 --> 00:04:38.250
 ensure patient care and 

00:04:36.090 --> 00:04:40.440
 then the patient also to the hospital 

00:04:38.250 --> 00:04:41.909
 transport but we need 

00:04:40.440 --> 00:04:43.620
 Executives 

00:04:41.909 --> 00:04:45.659
 we women leaders for that 

00:04:43.620 --> 00:04:47.190
 ensure that the right patient into the 

00:04:45.659 --> 00:04:49.289
 proper hospital is being transported 

00:04:47.190 --> 00:04:51.810
 with the right supply and that 

00:04:49.289 --> 00:04:53.370
 Our chief emergency doctors are there 

00:04:51.810 --> 00:04:57.000
 above all things about the interaction 

00:04:53.370 --> 00:05:00.009
 between the one who leads and the one 

00:04:57.000 --> 00:05:01.749
 employees are led 

00:05:00.009 --> 00:05:04.469
 I keep trying 

00:05:01.749 --> 00:05:07.629
 to point out that on the one hand 

00:05:04.469 --> 00:05:10.210
 body language but also certain 

00:05:07.629 --> 00:05:12.490
 expressions can lead to that 

00:05:10.210 --> 00:05:14.349
 is taken as a guide person seriously 

00:05:12.490 --> 00:05:16.240
 will or will not 

00:05:14.349 --> 00:05:17.740
 and that is dangerous for one 

00:05:16.240 --> 00:05:20.919
 manager if you are not serious 

00:05:17.740 --> 00:05:22.960
 taken because it ultimately again 

00:05:20.919 --> 00:05:25.270
 a very good overview of the 

00:05:22.960 --> 00:05:27.490
 cooperation of the forces at one 

00:05:25.270 --> 00:05:29.349
 has given great damage and you 

00:05:27.490 --> 00:05:30.879
 as could always see where 

00:05:29.349 --> 00:05:32.469
 there is possibly friction where 

00:05:30.879 --> 00:05:33.189
 you have to be in the structure in the 

00:05:32.469 --> 00:05:34.719
 collaboration 

00:05:33.189 --> 00:05:36.490
 Finally, see that one 

00:05:34.719 --> 00:05:38.349
 but can put a new focus around 

00:05:36.490 --> 00:05:40.899
 just such a one 

00:05:38.349 --> 00:05:42.460
 operational situation but also considered 

00:05:40.899 --> 00:05:45.399
 also good to work off so 

00:05:42.460 --> 00:05:48.129
 so the course was certainly one 

00:05:45.399 --> 00:05:50.399
 Help around the whole as possible 

00:05:48.129 --> 00:05:52.449
 Optimized to bring to the road 

00:05:50.399 --> 00:05:55.029
 the script is the institute for 

00:05:52.449 --> 00:05:57.219
 emergency medicine is since 1998 as 

00:05:55.029 --> 00:05:59.649
 Competence center for preclinical and 

00:05:57.219 --> 00:06:01.680
 we have clinical emergency medicine 

00:05:59.649 --> 00:06:04.300
 essentially three areas of responsibility 

00:06:01.680 --> 00:06:05.309
 His field of work is training 

00:06:04.300 --> 00:06:08.080
 after national and international 

00:06:05.309 --> 00:06:09.459
 standards for example after the 

00:06:08.080 --> 00:06:10.419
 regularities of the american heart 

00:06:09.459 --> 00:06:13.270
 association 

00:06:10.419 --> 00:06:15.120
 the second topic is participation 

00:06:13.270 --> 00:06:17.620
 a national international 

00:06:15.120 --> 00:06:20.680
 research project and the third topic 

00:06:17.620 --> 00:06:22.809
 is the advice for example for the 

00:06:20.680 --> 00:06:25.180
 central emergency room or even for 

00:06:22.809 --> 00:06:28.949
 Rescue services after the cup ko 

00:06:25.180 --> 00:06:28.949
 want to be certified
