00:00:11.570 --> 00:00:15.959
 hello dear subscribers we have to 

00:00:14.070 --> 00:00:17.430
 Forest channel in my head already summer I 

00:00:15.959 --> 00:00:19.349
 I offer in this video seriously 

00:00:17.430 --> 00:00:21.750
 prepare for the beach season with 

00:00:19.349 --> 00:00:23.849
 on on liposomes and peptides like you already 

00:00:21.750 --> 00:00:24.180
 guessed we will cook anti-cellulite 

00:00:23.849 --> 00:00:26.279
 cream 

00:00:24.180 --> 00:00:27.869
 start and fat phases which I will 

00:00:26.279 --> 00:00:30.029
 do with a combination of two 

00:00:27.869 --> 00:00:32.520
 natural emulsifiers plan tm and 

00:00:30.029 --> 00:00:33.540
 glycerol stearate take each one 

00:00:32.520 --> 00:00:35.610
 three percent 

00:00:33.540 --> 00:00:36.809
 cream turn out medium density but 

00:00:35.610 --> 00:00:41.399
 will be pretty easy and fast 

00:00:36.809 --> 00:00:43.409
 soak also in the fatty phase here 

00:00:41.399 --> 00:00:43.909
 one ketone asset will dissolve 

00:00:43.409 --> 00:00:46.350
 raspberries 

00:00:43.909 --> 00:00:48.210
 Japanese American scientists noticed for 

00:00:46.350 --> 00:00:51.059
 concrete raspberry properties stimulate 

00:00:48.210 --> 00:00:52.530
 production of the hormone adiponectin which 

00:00:51.059 --> 00:00:54.479
 responsible for splitting fat in 

00:00:52.530 --> 00:00:56.819
 body and controls the exchange process 

00:00:54.479 --> 00:00:58.979
 substances by the way it can be used not 

00:00:56.819 --> 00:01:00.780
 only a cure for cellulite even 

00:00:58.979 --> 00:01:02.550
 a means for the growth of eyelashes and 

00:01:00.780 --> 00:01:03.210
 anti-aging care and care for oily 

00:01:02.550 --> 00:01:05.850
 skin 

00:01:03.210 --> 00:01:07.380
 now move on to our oils first i 

00:01:05.850 --> 00:01:09.659
 I'll take shea butter which is wonderful 

00:01:07.380 --> 00:01:11.909
 absorbed gives excellent softening 

00:01:09.659 --> 00:01:13.290
 eight percent skin nutrition will 

00:01:11.909 --> 00:01:15.480
 enough 

00:01:13.290 --> 00:01:17.340
 second macadamia oil it enhances 

00:01:15.480 --> 00:01:18.060
 blood circulation which is very important in the fight 

00:01:17.340 --> 00:01:20.490
 with cellulite 

00:01:18.060 --> 00:01:21.750
 and also strengthens blood vessels and provides 

00:01:20.490 --> 00:01:23.700
 prevention of stretch marks 

00:01:21.750 --> 00:01:25.740
 rosehip oil we put already in 

00:01:23.700 --> 00:01:29.160
 active phase after cooling down the emulsion and 

00:01:25.740 --> 00:01:31.080
 for now let's move on to the water phase 

00:01:29.160 --> 00:01:33.030
 save your time watching videos i 

00:01:31.080 --> 00:01:34.920
 already poured water and added caffeine 

00:01:33.030 --> 00:01:36.810
 and now i want to add u to gel for 

00:01:34.920 --> 00:01:40.460
 moisturizing and improving tactile 

00:01:36.810 --> 00:01:40.460
 characteristics and stability of the cream 

00:01:40.610 --> 00:01:45.240
 all fatty aqueous phase ready as always 

00:01:43.620 --> 00:01:47.790
 melt them in a water bath 

00:01:45.240 --> 00:01:49.619
 mix and emulsify if you first 

00:01:47.790 --> 00:01:51.540
 on my channel, be sure to look 

00:01:49.619 --> 00:01:53.070
 video about creams again where that 

00:01:51.540 --> 00:01:55.050
 the process is explained in more detail 

00:01:53.070 --> 00:01:57.240
 and now we have everything ready for him and 

00:01:55.050 --> 00:01:59.090
 cool and in the active phase we can safely 

00:01:57.240 --> 00:02:01.350
 add 3 percent rosehip oil 

00:01:59.090 --> 00:02:04.770
 which will provide us with an effective fight 

00:02:01.350 --> 00:02:06.450
 with stretch marks and now i'm holding our 

00:02:04.770 --> 00:02:07.590
 the main active complex to combat 

00:02:06.450 --> 00:02:09.450
 orange peel 

00:02:07.590 --> 00:02:12.480
 and now we strike her first blow 

00:02:09.450 --> 00:02:14.280
 peptides using just do it yourself 

00:02:12.480 --> 00:02:16.080
 The first effective complex allows 

00:02:14.280 --> 00:02:18.000
 reduce adipocyte formation 

00:02:16.080 --> 00:02:19.950
 and reduce the formation of adipose tissue on 

00:02:18.000 --> 00:02:22.019
 cellular level I'll tell you now 

00:02:19.950 --> 00:02:24.480
 what is adipocytes 

00:02:22.019 --> 00:02:26.489
 adipocytes are fat cells they 

00:02:24.480 --> 00:02:27.180
 form the basis of subcutaneous fat 

00:02:26.489 --> 00:02:29.370
 fiber 

00:02:27.180 --> 00:02:31.260
 adipocyte contains fat drop 

00:02:29.370 --> 00:02:33.209
 which may increase in size 

00:02:31.260 --> 00:02:35.160
 with excess fat intake 

00:02:33.209 --> 00:02:37.590
 the body they percentage accumulates it 

00:02:35.160 --> 00:02:39.870
 and the fat drop grows as you grow 

00:02:37.590 --> 00:02:41.670
 a drop gradually explains the cell organs 

00:02:39.870 --> 00:02:43.900
 to the shell and ultimately takes 

00:02:41.670 --> 00:02:45.760
 almost all cell space 

00:02:43.900 --> 00:02:48.129
 as a result of growth fat drops itself 

00:02:45.760 --> 00:02:49.989
 adipocytes stretched to deep 

00:02:48.129 --> 00:02:52.540
 from here it can increase 27 times 

00:02:49.989 --> 00:02:54.640
 and this process is irreversible that is 

00:02:52.540 --> 00:02:56.260
 if the adipocytes are spread out he will not be able to 

00:02:54.640 --> 00:02:59.079
 lose weight to original size 

00:02:56.260 --> 00:03:00.939
 if you burn a fat-filling cell 

00:02:59.079 --> 00:03:03.099
 will be empty like a swollen air 

00:03:00.939 --> 00:03:04.780
 the ball but the radius and the membrane will remain 

00:03:03.099 --> 00:03:06.909
 former and with overflow 

00:03:04.780 --> 00:03:08.680
 adipocytes quickly calories 

00:03:06.909 --> 00:03:10.720
 restore your body fat to 

00:03:08.680 --> 00:03:13.209
 the membrane of each adipocyte is located 

00:03:10.720 --> 00:03:15.129
 two types of receptors are alpha receptors 

00:03:13.209 --> 00:03:18.069
 which synthesizes fat synthesis and 

00:03:15.129 --> 00:03:19.959
 beta receptors stimulating cleavage 

00:03:18.069 --> 00:03:21.909
 fat efficient technology now 

00:03:19.959 --> 00:03:23.440
 allows you to manage these processes 

00:03:21.909 --> 00:03:24.909
 peptide strength site reaches 

00:03:23.440 --> 00:03:27.010
 subcutaneous fat and 

00:03:24.909 --> 00:03:29.970
 affect targeted beta receptors 

00:03:27.010 --> 00:03:33.250
 reduces the supply of water to plant fat 

00:03:29.970 --> 00:03:35.560
 next asset on lpd slimming form 

00:03:33.250 --> 00:03:38.019
 I am showing him to you now 

00:03:35.560 --> 00:03:40.030
 video to topics he stood next to 

00:03:38.019 --> 00:03:42.040
 anti-cellulite assets but 

00:03:40.030 --> 00:03:44.379
 technology should be added to the cream 

00:03:42.040 --> 00:03:46.480
 last after homogenization and 

00:03:44.379 --> 00:03:48.669
 mix gently since liposomes 

00:03:46.480 --> 00:03:51.040
 it is a rather fragile shell structure 

00:03:48.669 --> 00:03:53.440
 liposomes these cell membranes are composed 

00:03:51.040 --> 00:03:55.870
 from lecithin therefore active ingredients 

00:03:53.440 --> 00:03:57.959
 generally water soluble which 

00:03:55.870 --> 00:04:00.040
 must be delivered deep into the skin 

00:03:57.959 --> 00:04:01.359
 packaged in artificially created 

00:04:00.040 --> 00:04:03.669
 lecithin membrane 

00:04:01.359 --> 00:04:05.290
 this nano either itself has a very small 

00:04:03.669 --> 00:04:07.030
 size and able to mix with 

00:04:05.290 --> 00:04:09.699
 cell membrane and in this way 

00:04:07.030 --> 00:04:11.859
 deliver assets very deep for 

00:04:09.699 --> 00:04:15.069
 the amount on at lpds lemming is located and 

00:04:11.859 --> 00:04:16.930
 caffeine and ivy and kelp extract whole 

00:04:15.069 --> 00:04:19.150
 active cocktail to combat unnecessary 

00:04:16.930 --> 00:04:21.430
 us a supply of caffeine kelp 

00:04:19.150 --> 00:04:23.289
 activate blood circulation and plus 

00:04:21.430 --> 00:04:25.510
 regulates vascular permeability for 

00:04:23.289 --> 00:04:27.830
 effective removal of fat its dosage 

00:04:25.510 --> 00:04:30.139
 35 percent but i will add 5 

00:04:27.830 --> 00:04:35.120
 do not forget to add you exactly at the end 

00:04:30.139 --> 00:04:37.969
 this is important the next asset 

00:04:35.120 --> 00:04:39.889
 supercritical co2 extract google he 

00:04:37.969 --> 00:04:42.229
 inhibits adipocyte maturation 

00:04:39.889 --> 00:04:44.180
 regulates glucose metabolism as well 

00:04:42.229 --> 00:04:46.430
 stimulates increased fat burning 

00:04:44.180 --> 00:04:48.379
 by the way all three assets are represented 

00:04:46.430 --> 00:04:50.870
 exclusive to the co2 extract shop 

00:04:48.379 --> 00:04:52.009
 links to all components i will leave under 

00:04:50.870 --> 00:04:56.330
 video in description 

00:04:52.009 --> 00:04:58.699
 and the last asset from our co2 series 

00:04:56.330 --> 00:04:59.949
 red pepper extract it enhances 

00:04:58.699 --> 00:05:01.789
 blood flow to the right places 

00:04:59.949 --> 00:05:04.370
 provides local acceleration 

00:05:01.789 --> 00:05:06.469
 metabolism and increases decay and output 

00:05:04.370 --> 00:05:08.419
 Jora, he is quite burning so I 

00:05:06.469 --> 00:05:10.280
 I use the minimum dosage but if 

00:05:08.419 --> 00:05:12.800
 you have large areas to attack 

00:05:10.280 --> 00:05:15.349
 use the maximum following 

00:05:12.800 --> 00:05:17.060
 Group assets in sosudoukreplyayuschee it 

00:05:15.349 --> 00:05:19.250
 we need due to the fact that caffeine 

00:05:17.060 --> 00:05:21.650
 tends to loosen vessels 

00:05:19.250 --> 00:05:23.509
 and we would not want it moreover 

00:05:21.650 --> 00:05:25.400
 thighs often present vascular 

00:05:23.509 --> 00:05:27.830
 asterisks and fight us with them will help 

00:05:25.400 --> 00:05:30.169
 primarily co2 horse extract 

00:05:27.830 --> 00:05:33.580
 chestnut recognized wine difficult and 

00:05:30.169 --> 00:05:33.580
 decongestant 

00:05:33.670 --> 00:05:37.030
 troxerutin is my new asset he 

00:05:35.770 --> 00:05:39.280
 is the main acting 

00:05:37.030 --> 00:05:41.430
 component of the well-known proxy ointment 

00:05:39.280 --> 00:05:43.660
 a vase that fights bruises 

00:05:41.430 --> 00:05:45.280
 stopping vessels and relieves puffiness 

00:05:43.660 --> 00:05:47.410
 and shown for varicose veins 

00:05:45.280 --> 00:05:49.510
 Well , it lasts is a classic fight
