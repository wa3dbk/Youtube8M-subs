00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:07.550
 Hello Agent 

00:00:02.150 --> 00:00:10.260
 The world rubber market is a good place for table tennis wisdom bags 

00:00:07.550 --> 00:00:13.320
 Today's theme is here 

00:00:10.260 --> 00:00:19.110
 I will try to go about Chikita's way 

00:00:13.320 --> 00:00:22.200
 This is a tight and stable Chiquita 

00:00:19.110 --> 00:00:27.360
 Everyone will always remember Chiquita 

00:00:22.200 --> 00:00:29.550
 Way everyone to master is to be able to Chiquita is a little I will try to practice 

00:00:27.360 --> 00:00:33.310
 Recently I also 

00:00:29.550 --> 00:00:38.980
 I'm actively using Chikita during that game 

00:00:33.310 --> 00:00:40.200
 I heard that it has been awfully quite special, so I released a renewal video of Chiquita this time 

00:00:38.980 --> 00:00:46.810
 I would like 

00:00:40.200 --> 00:00:48.910
 Chiquita is already a short serve to come to debug as a receive to pick up 

00:00:46.810 --> 00:00:52.720
 For a short serve coming to the fore 

00:00:48.910 --> 00:00:53.329
 You can attack from receive suddenly by doing chikyeta 

00:00:52.720 --> 00:00:55.050
 Short serve 

00:00:53.329 --> 00:01:01.370
 I also have another year 

00:00:55.050 --> 00:01:01.370
 It is a popular technique all over the world that you can attack gut 

00:01:12.250 --> 00:01:14.250
 Hmm 

00:01:16.100 --> 00:01:25.369
 We think that we want to do with power in three steps of this Chikita procedure immediately 

00:01:20.119 --> 00:01:26.270
 At first a little recommended way of attitude when entering the inter before entering Step 1 

00:01:25.369 --> 00:01:29.420
 I'd like to introduce 

00:01:26.270 --> 00:01:34.850
 Everyone recommended at the time to do the origin mobile 

00:01:29.420 --> 00:01:36.090
 It is recommended that you keep your attitude lower than usual 

00:01:34.850 --> 00:01:40.799
 This attitude is 

00:01:36.090 --> 00:01:47.009
 First of all, it is first to lower the attitude of sinking the passenger 

00:01:40.799 --> 00:01:53.640
 It will be said that this moveable range of Chiquita is easy to increase I noticed this too 

00:01:47.009 --> 00:01:54.899
 Recently I put the earthwork attitude low from the beginning of the day, but the whole Chiquita 

00:01:53.640 --> 00:01:56.080
 It will be easier 

00:01:54.899 --> 00:02:01.600
 Step 1 from here 

00:01:56.080 --> 00:02:03.270
 It's a nail. First of all, when the opponent comes back to serve back, I do a chikita. 

00:02:01.600 --> 00:02:06.689
 When 

00:02:03.270 --> 00:02:10.289
 The height of the elbow is very important 

00:02:06.689 --> 00:02:18.840
 First of all, with a Chikyeta , a wrist 

00:02:10.289 --> 00:02:23.670
 It is a story that how to rub , but Chikita is actually the elbow first 

00:02:18.840 --> 00:02:29.970
 It was a very important point to do kichikita 

00:02:23.670 --> 00:02:32.340
 The height of this elbow and the first insertion of the elbow is the difference between those who can and who can not this Chiquita 

00:02:29.970 --> 00:02:37.319
 It is a person who can not be nervous anymore 

00:02:32.340 --> 00:02:38.860
 The person who is putting out the appearance Chikita is only the small tip which elbow which can not use elbow is not included 

00:02:37.319 --> 00:02:39.860
 It does not take stable 

00:02:38.860 --> 00:02:44.210
 not 

00:02:39.860 --> 00:02:45.590
 Chiquita place is good I'll hear everyone's here of top players from there went from the elbow 

00:02:44.210 --> 00:02:51.890
 When the elbow is right there 

00:02:45.590 --> 00:02:56.870
 It's in a high and high position, so it's a good idea to set the elbow high. 

00:02:51.890 --> 00:02:59.850
 The very first I thing you want to do in earlier if there be a little glad when this 

00:02:56.870 --> 00:03:03.870
 It is necessary at the time of Chikita to lower the attitude 

00:02:59.850 --> 00:03:09.000
 I told you to lower it, but if you lower your attitude 

00:03:03.870 --> 00:03:12.510
 It is easy to put the elbows, I decided that Saab came and decided to make a Chikita and lower the attitude 

00:03:09.000 --> 00:03:16.440
 That makes it easier for the elbow to rise when compared 

00:03:12.510 --> 00:03:22.370
 So when you lower your posture naturally, your elbow will go up 

00:03:16.440 --> 00:03:22.370
 You enter from the elbow and you will feel like Chikita 

00:03:28.900 --> 00:03:38.320
 The second of the two eyes is I now step-by-step instructions of the now procedure 

00:03:33.130 --> 00:03:42.550
 It's a place that attracts you-Chiquita is actually that 

00:03:38.320 --> 00:03:48.340
 If you try to shoot at such an early timing with the tip of a hand, it will not be stable after all 

00:03:42.550 --> 00:03:53.120
 Strong players are good players Chikita sees and bounces when the serve comes and receives 

00:03:48.340 --> 00:03:56.020
 Wait until after the super point or vertex 

00:03:53.120 --> 00:03:59.680
 My mother said Chiquita Te 

00:03:56.020 --> 00:04:03.460
 Chiquita from making a I'm doing on the skin Tame 

00:03:59.680 --> 00:04:06.520
 I 'm doing that recently in the world , is that strong 

00:04:03.460 --> 00:04:13.060
 Because of this time it has worldwide also become more and more long now 

00:04:06.520 --> 00:04:13.870
 It is time to accumulate in order to give the attack performance and power of the sphere of the other more and more attack power side spin 

00:04:13.060 --> 00:04:16.040
 increasing 

00:04:13.870 --> 00:04:20.810
 There is an effect of attracting this 

00:04:16.040 --> 00:04:25.790
 Ensuring time to accumulate and rotation increases 

00:04:20.810 --> 00:04:30.620
 In to say the rotation increases is got to less susceptible to the influence of against Saab stability opponent 

00:04:25.790 --> 00:04:34.160
 So it's easy to get back the power and it's easy to receive it. 

00:04:30.620 --> 00:04:35.210
 Power model to do You're also stable it makes sense is that Tteyuu Jan anymore soooo 

00:04:34.160 --> 00:04:38.420
 Will be 

00:04:35.210 --> 00:04:41.889
 Enter from the temporary Moreover, in such of 

00:04:38.420 --> 00:04:45.509
 In the situation where you lower your attitude and go from one hour 

00:04:41.889 --> 00:04:45.509
 It is easy to make Tame 

00:04:56.200 --> 00:04:58.200
 Hmm 

00:05:04.430 --> 00:05:08.440
 th 

00:05:07.080 --> 00:05:12.850
 th 

00:05:08.440 --> 00:05:17.440
 It is the third of the procedure It will finally be said to hit here 

00:05:12.850 --> 00:05:21.910
 That 's how Chikita's ball is caught 

00:05:17.440 --> 00:05:25.660
 Of course I'm going to make a side turn, but what I say is my best recommendation 

00:05:21.910 --> 00:05:28.430
 If I have a high ball, I will let you see for a moment 

00:05:25.660 --> 00:05:31.940
 Not just behind the ball 

00:05:28.430 --> 00:05:37.260
 And left back shin left oblique back 

00:05:31.940 --> 00:05:39.050
 Or from directly behind it is here captures the left behind 

00:05:37.260 --> 00:05:41.169
 Apply lateral rotation 

00:05:39.050 --> 00:05:44.770
 Please try to say 

00:05:41.169 --> 00:05:48.150
 That fact is when I first put out the Chiquita a little while ago 

00:05:44.770 --> 00:05:53.560
 Although I've been saying that a good idea to capture the right behind 

00:05:48.150 --> 00:05:59.379
 I put out is amazing the amount of rotation when the rub thin when right behind was Yaro takes great spin 

00:05:53.560 --> 00:06:01.160
 However, there was one that still did not show a sense of stability quite easily, so the recommendation is left diagonal back 

00:05:59.379 --> 00:06:06.740
 When left 

00:06:01.160 --> 00:06:11.980
 If you try to catch such a feeling behind , this left is the first behind the pot 

00:06:06.740 --> 00:06:11.980
 It will be a position where the balance of stability and power of Chiquita is high 

00:06:23.780 --> 00:06:30.130
 There is a lot of people who are open and stable . 

00:06:31.840 --> 00:06:34.590
 th 

00:06:46.009 --> 00:06:48.009
 Hmm 

00:06:57.449 --> 00:06:59.599
 a 

00:07:00.210 --> 00:07:02.840
 Ah ah ah ah 

00:07:17.270 --> 00:07:20.060
 a 

00:07:18.930 --> 00:07:22.419
 a 

00:07:20.060 --> 00:07:22.419
 Yup 

00:07:23.849 --> 00:07:26.809
 I thought 

00:07:29.100 --> 00:07:31.430
 voice 

00:07:32.100 --> 00:07:36.740
 ban 

00:07:33.740 --> 00:07:36.740
