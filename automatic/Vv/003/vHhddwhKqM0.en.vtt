00:02:32.360 --> 00:02:32.370 
around the perimeter and so I really

00:02:32.370 --> 00:02:35.090

gave me it felt like like I said it was

00:02:37.290 --> 00:02:40.580 
gave me it felt like like I said it was
like<00:02:37.320> a<00:02:37.770> suction<00:02:38.550> once<00:02:39.450> she<00:02:39.630> laid<00:02:40.110> the<00:02:40.320> lace

00:02:40.580 --> 00:02:40.590
