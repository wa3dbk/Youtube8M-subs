00:00:32.159 --> 00:00:32.169 
sixteen ounces on the blender I know I'm

00:00:32.169 --> 00:00:35.040 
sixteen ounces on the blender I know I'm
the<00:00:32.199> packets<00:00:32.769> of<00:00:32.920> Shakeology<00:00:33.280> it<00:00:34.059> says<00:00:34.510> I

00:00:35.040 --> 00:00:35.050 
the packets of Shakeology it says I

00:00:35.050 --> 00:00:38.310 
the packets of Shakeology it says I
think<00:00:35.199> it<00:00:35.410> says<00:00:35.590> eight<00:00:35.830> ounces<00:00:36.280> but<00:00:37.120> I<00:00:37.629> like<00:00:38.290> a

00:00:38.310 --> 00:00:38.320 
think it says eight ounces but I like a

00:00:38.320 --> 00:00:39.780 
think it says eight ounces but I like a
little<00:00:38.530> bit<00:00:38.739> of<00:00:38.769> a<00:00:38.979> bigger<00:00:39.159> shake<00:00:39.460> and<00:00:39.610> I<00:00:39.640> don't

00:00:39.780 --> 00:00:39.790 
little bit of a bigger shake and I don't

00:00:39.790 --> 00:00:41.009 
little bit of a bigger shake and I don't
mind<00:00:39.940> it<00:00:40.059> being<00:00:40.180> a<00:00:40.269> little<00:00:40.479> bit<00:00:40.600> thinner<00:00:40.900> and

00:00:41.009 --> 00:00:41.019 
mind it being a little bit thinner and

00:00:41.019 --> 00:00:43.770 
mind it being a little bit thinner and
less<00:00:41.470> thick<00:00:41.799> so<00:00:42.010> that's<00:00:42.190> what<00:00:42.370> I<00:00:42.400> do<00:00:42.580> and<00:00:43.120> then

00:00:43.770 --> 00:00:43.780 
less thick so that's what I do and then

00:00:43.780 --> 00:00:45.930 
less thick so that's what I do and then
I<00:00:43.809> used<00:00:44.080> some<00:00:44.199> ice<00:00:44.470> I<00:00:45.040> have<00:00:45.280> this<00:00:45.400> scooper<00:00:45.850> in

00:00:45.930 --> 00:00:45.940 
I used some ice I have this scooper in

00:00:45.940 --> 00:00:47.250 
I used some ice I have this scooper in
our<00:00:46.030> ice<00:00:46.150> maker<00:00:46.420> so<00:00:46.600> it's<00:00:46.780> probably<00:00:47.049> about<00:00:47.140> a

00:00:47.250 --> 00:00:47.260 
our ice maker so it's probably about a

00:00:47.260 --> 00:00:51.630 
our ice maker so it's probably about a
cup<00:00:47.500> of<00:00:47.530> ice<00:00:49.019> and<00:00:50.019> then<00:00:50.650> if<00:00:51.369> you're<00:00:51.489> using

00:00:51.630 --> 00:00:51.640 
cup of ice and then if you're using

00:00:51.640 --> 00:00:53.460 
cup of ice and then if you're using
packets<00:00:52.210> you<00:00:52.360> use<00:00:52.570> the<00:00:52.750> whole<00:00:52.930> packet<00:00:53.320> that's

00:00:53.460 --> 00:00:53.470 
packets you use the whole packet that's

00:00:53.470 --> 00:00:56.009 
packets you use the whole packet that's
one<00:00:53.739> serving<00:00:54.250> if<00:00:54.699> you<00:00:54.940> get<00:00:55.269> your<00:00:55.360> Shakeology

00:00:56.009 --> 00:00:56.019
