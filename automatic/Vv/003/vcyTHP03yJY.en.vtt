00:00:12.780 --> 00:00:14.810 
maintain them in a healthy and aesthetic
way<00:00:13.259> it's<00:00:13.679> going<00:00:13.860> to<00:00:13.920> look<00:00:13.980> good<00:00:14.190> in<00:00:14.280> your<00:00:14.400> yard

now<00:00:15.480> everybody<00:00:16.049> assumes<00:00:16.379> when<00:00:16.529> we<00:00:16.619> start

00:00:16.849 --> 00:00:16.859 
now everybody assumes when we start

00:00:16.859 --> 00:00:18.439 
now everybody assumes when we start
talking<00:00:17.010> about<00:00:17.250> pruning<00:00:17.640> we've<00:00:18.060> got<00:00:18.240> to<00:00:18.330> break

00:00:18.439 --> 00:00:18.449 
talking about pruning we've got to break

00:00:18.449 --> 00:00:20.570 
talking about pruning we've got to break
out<00:00:18.660> the<00:00:18.810> tools<00:00:18.960> right<00:00:19.320> away<00:00:19.560> but<00:00:20.310> there<00:00:20.460> are

00:00:20.570 --> 00:00:20.580 
out the tools right away but there are

00:00:20.580 --> 00:00:23.509 
out the tools right away but there are
even<00:00:20.850> pruning<00:00:21.510> jobs<00:00:21.810> say<00:00:22.650> like<00:00:23.130> on<00:00:23.279> the<00:00:23.400> new

00:00:23.509 --> 00:00:23.519 
even pruning jobs say like on the new

00:00:23.519 --> 00:00:25.790 
even pruning jobs say like on the new
foliage<00:00:23.820> of<00:00:24.150> a<00:00:24.269> blue<00:00:24.449> spruce<00:00:24.720> that's<00:00:25.529> best

00:00:25.790 --> 00:00:25.800 
foliage of a blue spruce that's best

00:00:25.800 --> 00:00:29.120

handled by hand simply by snapping off
and<00:00:29.480> shortening<00:00:30.480> the<00:00:30.630> length<00:00:30.869> and<00:00:31.399> actually

00:00:32.389 --> 00:00:32.399 
and shortening the length and actually

00:00:32.399 --> 00:00:34.639 
and shortening the length and actually
removing<00:00:32.880> the<00:00:32.969> entire<00:00:33.270> candles<00:00:33.870> on<00:00:34.050> some<00:00:34.559> of

00:00:34.639 --> 00:00:34.649 
removing the entire candles on some of

00:00:34.649 --> 00:00:38.180 
removing the entire candles on some of
these<00:00:34.710> branches<00:00:35.070> I<00:00:35.520> can<00:00:36.510> control<00:00:36.930> the<00:00:37.920> length

00:00:38.180 --> 00:00:38.190 
these branches I can control the length

00:00:38.190 --> 00:00:40.000 
these branches I can control the length
of<00:00:38.370> the<00:00:38.460> growth<00:00:38.700> for<00:00:39.030> that<00:00:39.180> season

00:00:40.000 --> 00:00:40.010 
of the growth for that season

00:00:40.010 --> 00:00:42.380 
of the growth for that season
simply<00:00:41.010> by<00:00:41.160> shutting<00:00:41.579> down<00:00:41.760> the<00:00:41.940> growth<00:00:42.149> of

00:00:42.380 --> 00:00:42.390 
simply by shutting down the growth of

00:00:42.390 --> 00:00:46.160 
simply by shutting down the growth of
that<00:00:42.480> particular<00:00:43.079> branch<00:00:44.780> that's<00:00:45.780> going<00:00:46.110> to

00:00:46.160 --> 00:00:46.170 
that particular branch that's going to

00:00:46.170 --> 00:00:49.760 
that particular branch that's going to
cause<00:00:46.739> the<00:00:46.980> tree<00:00:47.160> to<00:00:47.190> bud<00:00:47.520> back<00:00:48.379> creating<00:00:49.379> more

00:00:49.760 --> 00:00:49.770 
cause the tree to bud back creating more

00:00:49.770 --> 00:00:51.979 
cause the tree to bud back creating more
buds<00:00:50.070> back<00:00:50.340> behind<00:00:50.579> causing<00:00:51.420> it<00:00:51.480> to<00:00:51.600> fill<00:00:51.780> in

00:00:51.979 --> 00:00:51.989 
buds back behind causing it to fill in

00:00:51.989 --> 00:00:55.400 
buds back behind causing it to fill in
and<00:00:52.379> that's<00:00:52.530> the<00:00:52.739> real<00:00:52.890> reason<00:00:53.309> we<00:00:53.430> prune<00:00:54.410> well

00:00:55.400 --> 00:00:55.410 
and that's the real reason we prune well

00:00:55.410 --> 00:00:57.470 
and that's the real reason we prune well
that's<00:00:55.620> the<00:00:55.770> easy<00:00:55.800> way<00:00:56.160> to<00:00:56.219> get<00:00:56.430> it<00:00:56.640> but<00:00:57.300> not

00:00:57.470 --> 00:00:57.480 
that's the easy way to get it but not

00:00:57.480 --> 00:00:58.729 
that's the easy way to get it but not
all<00:00:57.750> of<00:00:57.780> them<00:00:57.989> are<00:00:58.079> going<00:00:58.170> to<00:00:58.230> be<00:00:58.350> able<00:00:58.440> to<00:00:58.559> be

00:00:58.729 --> 00:00:58.739 
all of them are going to be able to be

00:00:58.739 --> 00:00:59.950 
all of them are going to be able to be
done<00:00:58.920> by<00:00:59.100> hand

00:00:59.950 --> 00:00:59.960 
done by hand

00:00:59.960 --> 00:01:01.880 
done by hand
sometimes<00:01:00.960> you<00:01:01.109> need<00:01:01.199> to<00:01:01.260> break<00:01:01.469> out<00:01:01.739> the

00:01:01.880 --> 00:01:01.890 
sometimes you need to break out the

00:01:01.890 --> 00:01:03.799 
sometimes you need to break out the
pruners<00:01:02.300> especially<00:01:03.300> for<00:01:03.480> woody<00:01:03.660> or

00:01:03.799 --> 00:01:03.809 
pruners especially for woody or

00:01:03.809 --> 00:01:08.300 
pruners especially for woody or
deciduous<00:01:04.170> plants<00:01:05.150> now<00:01:06.150> my<00:01:06.900> Hollies<00:01:07.380> got<00:01:08.040> done

00:01:08.300 --> 00:01:08.310 
deciduous plants now my Hollies got done

00:01:08.310 --> 00:01:11.330 
deciduous plants now my Hollies got done
flowering<00:01:08.659> about<00:01:09.659> a<00:01:09.689> week<00:01:09.960> ago<00:01:10.260> and<00:01:11.159> that's

00:01:11.330 --> 00:01:11.340 
flowering about a week ago and that's

00:01:11.340 --> 00:01:14.120 
flowering about a week ago and that's
important<00:01:11.790> to<00:01:11.880> remember<00:01:12.290> best<00:01:13.290> time<00:01:13.680> to<00:01:13.860> prune

00:01:14.120 --> 00:01:14.130 
important to remember best time to prune

00:01:14.130 --> 00:01:17.120 
important to remember best time to prune
for<00:01:14.729> almost<00:01:14.939> all<00:01:15.119> plants<00:01:15.630> is<00:01:15.890> right<00:01:16.890> after

00:01:17.120 --> 00:01:17.130 
for almost all plants is right after

00:01:17.130 --> 00:01:19.190 
for almost all plants is right after
they<00:01:17.400> got<00:01:17.549> done<00:01:17.759> flowering<00:01:18.330> that<00:01:18.509> way<00:01:19.080> you're

00:01:19.190 --> 00:01:19.200 
they got done flowering that way you're

00:01:19.200 --> 00:01:21.020 
they got done flowering that way you're
not<00:01:19.229> pruning<00:01:19.710> off<00:01:19.860> next<00:01:20.130> year's<00:01:20.340> flower<00:01:20.640> buds

00:01:21.020 --> 00:01:21.030

00:01:21.030 --> 00:01:22.880 
not pruning off next year's flower buds
which<00:01:21.570> in<00:01:21.720> some<00:01:21.900> cases<00:01:22.080> can<00:01:22.470> definitely

which in some cases can definitely

electric prej pruner or something like

00:01:31.979 --> 00:01:33.800 
electric prej pruner or something like
that<00:01:32.250> just<00:01:32.280> buzz<00:01:32.880> this<00:01:33.119> thing<00:01:33.360> right<00:01:33.540> around

00:01:33.800 --> 00:01:33.810 
that just buzz this thing right around

00:01:33.810 --> 00:01:36.830 
that just buzz this thing right around
it's<00:01:34.650> one<00:01:34.799> of<00:01:34.890> the<00:01:34.979> worst<00:01:35.250> ways<00:01:35.549> to<00:01:35.820> prune<00:01:36.090> it

00:01:36.830 --> 00:01:36.840 
it's one of the worst ways to prune it

00:01:36.840 --> 00:01:39.109 
it's one of the worst ways to prune it
really<00:01:37.320> doesn't<00:01:37.590> make<00:01:37.680> a<00:01:37.740> clean<00:01:38.100> cut<00:01:38.130> it<00:01:38.729> just

00:01:39.109 --> 00:01:39.119 
really doesn't make a clean cut it just

00:01:39.119 --> 00:01:41.270 
really doesn't make a clean cut it just
tackled<00:01:39.689> it<00:01:39.810> up<00:01:39.990> and<00:01:40.229> I<00:01:40.740> don't<00:01:40.799> like<00:01:41.159> it

00:01:41.270 --> 00:01:41.280 
tackled it up and I don't like it

00:01:41.280 --> 00:01:42.679 
tackled it up and I don't like it
because<00:01:41.400> it<00:01:41.549> leaves<00:01:41.759> a<00:01:41.909> less<00:01:42.119> than<00:01:42.150> natural

00:01:42.679 --> 00:01:42.689 
because it leaves a less than natural

00:01:42.689 --> 00:01:44.690 
because it leaves a less than natural
look<00:01:42.840> to<00:01:42.990> the<00:01:43.079> shrub<00:01:43.350> I<00:01:43.590> prefer<00:01:44.430> to<00:01:44.549> go<00:01:44.670> with

00:01:44.700 --> 00:01:48.950 
look to the shrub I prefer to go with
hand<00:01:45.180> pruners<00:01:45.390> and<00:01:46.040> cut<00:01:47.270> now<00:01:48.270> I've<00:01:48.450> picked

00:01:48.950 --> 00:01:48.960 
hand pruners and cut now I've picked

00:01:48.960 --> 00:01:52.010
