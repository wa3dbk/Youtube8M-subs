is<00:01:00.010> the<00:01:00.159> older<00:01:00.609> style<00:01:00.969> with<00:01:02.819> the<00:01:03.819> sort<00:01:04.210> of

00:01:04.249 --> 00:01:04.259 
is the older style with the sort of

00:01:04.259 --> 00:01:07.889 
is the older style with the sort of
straight<00:01:05.259> trim<00:01:05.649> and<00:01:05.950> then<00:01:06.549> you<00:01:06.700> get<00:01:06.969> what<00:01:07.689> what
