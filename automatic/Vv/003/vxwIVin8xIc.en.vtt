three<00:00:12.139> reasons<00:00:12.650> why<00:00:12.980> to<00:00:13.040> get<00:00:13.400> the<00:00:13.550> gear<00:00:13.880> 2<00:00:14.300> now

00:00:15.160 --> 00:00:15.170 
three reasons why to get the gear 2 now

00:00:15.170 --> 00:00:16.990 
three reasons why to get the gear 2 now
a<00:00:15.290> lot<00:00:15.470> of<00:00:15.500> people<00:00:15.769> have<00:00:15.920> wondered<00:00:16.279> is<00:00:16.520> the

00:00:16.990 --> 00:00:17.000 
a lot of people have wondered is the

00:00:17.000 --> 00:00:18.670 
a lot of people have wondered is the
gear<00:00:17.270> really<00:00:17.480> worth<00:00:17.750> that<00:00:18.050> there's<00:00:18.380> so<00:00:18.560> many

00:00:18.670 --> 00:00:18.680 
gear really worth that there's so many

00:00:18.680 --> 00:00:20.620 
gear really worth that there's so many
smartwatches<00:00:19.279> coming<00:00:19.640> on<00:00:19.700> the<00:00:19.790> market<00:00:20.150> so<00:00:20.360> why

00:00:20.620 --> 00:00:20.630 
smartwatches coming on the market so why

00:00:20.630 --> 00:00:23.080 
smartwatches coming on the market so why
should<00:00:21.050> I<00:00:21.079> get<00:00:21.200> the<00:00:21.410> gear<00:00:21.650> 2<00:00:22.009> well

00:00:23.080 --> 00:00:23.090 
should I get the gear 2 well

00:00:23.090 --> 00:00:24.609 
should I get the gear 2 well
these<00:00:23.270> are<00:00:23.390> three<00:00:23.630> reasons<00:00:23.779> what<00:00:24.079> I<00:00:24.110> think<00:00:24.529> you

00:00:24.609 --> 00:00:24.619 
these are three reasons what I think you

00:00:24.619 --> 00:00:26.350 
these are three reasons what I think you
should<00:00:24.650> and<00:00:25.130> if<00:00:25.610> they're<00:00:25.790> compelling<00:00:26.119> enough

00:00:26.350 --> 00:00:26.360 
should and if they're compelling enough

00:00:26.360 --> 00:00:28.060 
should and if they're compelling enough
you<00:00:26.720> should<00:00:26.779> go<00:00:26.989> out<00:00:27.050> and<00:00:27.079> buy<00:00:27.230> one<00:00:27.529> so<00:00:27.860> let's

00:00:28.060 --> 00:00:28.070 
you should go out and buy one so let's

00:00:28.070 --> 00:00:30.880 
you should go out and buy one so let's
see<00:00:28.279> if<00:00:28.400> they<00:00:28.579> are<00:00:28.960> for<00:00:29.960> the<00:00:30.020> first<00:00:30.259> reason<00:00:30.739> is

00:00:30.880 --> 00:00:30.890 
see if they are for the first reason is

00:00:30.890 --> 00:00:33.610 
see if they are for the first reason is
the<00:00:31.009> most<00:00:31.579> basic<00:00:31.849> one<00:00:32.180> and<00:00:32.689> that<00:00:32.840> is<00:00:33.050> because

00:00:33.610 --> 00:00:33.620 
the most basic one and that is because

00:00:33.620 --> 00:00:36.939 
the most basic one and that is because
of<00:00:34.360> notifications<00:00:35.710> smartwatches

00:00:36.939 --> 00:00:36.949 
of notifications smartwatches

00:00:36.949 --> 00:00:38.860 
of notifications smartwatches
are<00:00:37.129> mainly<00:00:37.519> used<00:00:37.699> because<00:00:38.090> the<00:00:38.510> fact<00:00:38.750> that

00:00:38.860 --> 00:00:38.870 
are mainly used because the fact that

00:00:38.870 --> 00:00:40.599 
are mainly used because the fact that
you<00:00:38.960> get<00:00:39.199> all<00:00:39.440> of<00:00:39.590> your<00:00:39.649> notifications<00:00:39.949> on

00:00:40.599 --> 00:00:40.609 
you get all of your notifications on

00:00:40.609 --> 00:00:42.880 
you get all of your notifications on
this<00:00:41.030> device<00:00:41.359> and<00:00:41.719> with<00:00:41.930> the<00:00:42.019> gear<00:00:42.199> 2<00:00:42.410> you<00:00:42.649> can

00:00:42.880 --> 00:00:42.890 
this device and with the gear 2 you can

00:00:42.890 --> 00:00:45.669 
this device and with the gear 2 you can
get<00:00:43.100> it<00:00:43.190> from<00:00:43.309> any<00:00:43.609> single<00:00:44.030> app<00:00:44.410> this<00:00:45.410> is<00:00:45.649> a

00:00:45.669 --> 00:00:45.679 
get it from any single app this is a

00:00:45.679 --> 00:00:48.069 
get it from any single app this is a
really<00:00:46.010> nice<00:00:46.160> feature<00:00:46.460> to<00:00:46.730> have<00:00:46.910> because<00:00:47.390> the

00:00:48.069 --> 00:00:48.079 
really nice feature to have because the

00:00:48.079 --> 00:00:50.319 
really nice feature to have because the
average<00:00:48.230> person<00:00:48.410> looks<00:00:48.859> at<00:00:48.920> their<00:00:49.100> screen<00:00:49.370> 150

00:00:50.319 --> 00:00:50.329 
average person looks at their screen 150

00:00:50.329 --> 00:00:53.500 
average person looks at their screen 150
times<00:00:50.539> a<00:00:50.719> day<00:00:50.899> add<00:00:51.460> 1<00:00:52.460> to<00:00:52.609> 5<00:00:52.760> seconds<00:00:53.210> up<00:00:53.329> for

00:00:53.500 --> 00:00:53.510 
times a day add 1 to 5 seconds up for

00:00:53.510 --> 00:00:55.389 
times a day add 1 to 5 seconds up for
each<00:00:53.660> of<00:00:53.809> those<00:00:53.899> hundred<00:00:54.199> 50<00:00:54.350> times<00:00:54.589> and<00:00:54.890> it

00:00:55.389 --> 00:00:55.399 
each of those hundred 50 times and it

00:00:55.399 --> 00:00:57.239 
each of those hundred 50 times and it
tells<00:00:55.789> you<00:00:55.969> why<00:00:56.179> it's<00:00:56.629> such<00:00:56.839> a<00:00:56.870> good<00:00:57.050> idea
