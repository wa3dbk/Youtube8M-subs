00:03:55.580 --> 00:03:55.590 
to recover and it it does not seem to

00:03:55.590 --> 00:03:57.920 
to recover and it it does not seem to
recover<00:03:55.950> in<00:03:56.189> terms<00:03:56.430> of<00:03:56.669> a<00:03:56.790> human<00:03:57.150> lifetime<00:03:57.750> or

00:03:57.920 --> 00:03:57.930 
recover in terms of a human lifetime or

00:03:57.930 --> 00:03:59.839 
recover in terms of a human lifetime or
two<00:03:58.079> but<00:03:58.769> what<00:03:58.950> were<00:03:59.069> asked<00:03:59.340> is<00:03:59.430> what<00:03:59.609> can<00:03:59.760> we

00:03:59.839 --> 00:03:59.849 
two but what were asked is what can we

00:03:59.849 --> 00:04:00.589 
two but what were asked is what can we
do<00:03:59.969> about<00:04:00.060> it

00:04:00.589 --> 00:04:00.599 
do about it

00:04:00.599 --> 00:04:02.050 
do about it
and<00:04:01.019> that's<00:04:01.169> a<00:04:01.260> difficult<00:04:01.560> thing<00:04:01.590> because

00:04:02.050 --> 00:04:02.060 
and that's a difficult thing because

00:04:02.060 --> 00:04:05.659 
and that's a difficult thing because
because<00:04:03.060> the<00:04:03.180> politicians<00:04:03.750> would<00:04:03.989> like<00:04:04.609> us<00:04:05.609> to

00:04:05.659 --> 00:04:05.669 
because the politicians would like us to

00:04:05.669 --> 00:04:07.580 
because the politicians would like us to
tell<00:04:06.030> them<00:04:06.209> that<00:04:06.359> there's<00:04:06.510> a<00:04:06.569> magic<00:04:06.930> sort<00:04:07.530> of

00:04:07.580 --> 00:04:07.590 
tell them that there's a magic sort of

00:04:07.590 --> 00:04:09.530 
tell them that there's a magic sort of
wand<00:04:07.799> which<00:04:08.250> will<00:04:08.459> fix<00:04:08.760> it<00:04:08.940> but<00:04:09.180> there<00:04:09.389> isn't

00:04:09.530 --> 00:04:09.540 
wand which will fix it but there isn't

00:04:09.540 --> 00:04:13.399 
wand which will fix it but there isn't
so<00:04:10.190> most<00:04:11.190> of<00:04:11.310> the<00:04:11.599> follow-up<00:04:12.599> work<00:04:12.989> which<00:04:13.260> we

00:04:13.399 --> 00:04:13.409 
so most of the follow-up work which we

00:04:13.409 --> 00:04:16.219 
so most of the follow-up work which we
can<00:04:13.590> do<00:04:13.739> now<00:04:13.949> is<00:04:14.389> preparing<00:04:15.389> I<00:04:15.510> think<00:04:16.019> for<00:04:16.169> the

00:04:16.219 --> 00:04:16.229 
can do now is preparing I think for the

00:04:16.229 --> 00:04:19.219 
can do now is preparing I think for the
harmful<00:04:16.680> effects<00:04:16.979> that<00:04:17.190> this<00:04:17.340> will<00:04:17.549> cause<00:04:18.239> we

00:04:19.219 --> 00:04:19.229 
harmful effects that this will cause we

00:04:19.229 --> 00:04:20.870 
harmful effects that this will cause we
all<00:04:19.320> know<00:04:19.349> about<00:04:19.739> global<00:04:20.159> warming<00:04:20.190> and<00:04:20.579> so<00:04:20.760> on

00:04:20.870 --> 00:04:20.880 
all know about global warming and so on

00:04:20.880 --> 00:04:23.779 
all know about global warming and so on
and<00:04:21.060> it's<00:04:21.269> quite<00:04:22.229> a<00:04:22.260> severe<00:04:22.789> manifestation

00:04:23.779 --> 00:04:23.789 
and it's quite a severe manifestation

00:04:23.789 --> 00:04:25.640 
and it's quite a severe manifestation
and<00:04:24.000> I'm<00:04:24.389> swingley<00:04:25.050> pleased<00:04:25.229> you<00:04:25.349> asked<00:04:25.500> me

00:04:25.640 --> 00:04:25.650 
and I'm swingley pleased you asked me

00:04:25.650 --> 00:04:27.379 
and I'm swingley pleased you asked me
about<00:04:25.740> this<00:04:25.979> because<00:04:26.159> I've<00:04:26.789> had<00:04:27.120> some

00:04:27.379 --> 00:04:27.389 
about this because I've had some

00:04:27.389 --> 00:04:30.170 
about this because I've had some
struggles<00:04:27.990> with<00:04:28.259> the<00:04:28.470> media<00:04:28.770> who<00:04:29.669> are<00:04:29.909> not

00:04:30.170 --> 00:04:30.180 
struggles with the media who are not

00:04:30.180 --> 00:04:32.390 
struggles with the media who are not
terribly<00:04:30.900> interested<00:04:31.620> if<00:04:31.830> there's<00:04:32.130> a<00:04:32.190> pretty

00:04:32.390 --> 00:04:32.400 
terribly interested if there's a pretty

00:04:32.400 --> 00:04:34.700 
terribly interested if there's a pretty
bird<00:04:32.639> a<00:04:32.880> nice<00:04:33.060> fish<00:04:33.449> or<00:04:33.780> a<00:04:33.810> panda<00:04:34.229> or<00:04:34.680> a

bird a nice fish or a panda or a

00:04:34.710 --> 00:04:37.760 
bird a nice fish or a panda or a
something<00:04:35.490> spectacular<00:04:36.060> like<00:04:36.630> that<00:04:36.870> then

00:04:37.760 --> 00:04:37.770 
something spectacular like that then

00:04:37.770 --> 00:04:40.550 
something spectacular like that then
they<00:04:38.610> want<00:04:38.789> to<00:04:38.909> know<00:04:39.090> but<00:04:39.810> when<00:04:39.990> an<00:04:40.110> ecosystem

00:04:40.550 --> 00:04:40.560 
they want to know but when an ecosystem

00:04:40.560 --> 00:04:43.790 
they want to know but when an ecosystem
dies<00:04:41.370> or<00:04:42.090> at<00:04:42.570> least<00:04:42.930> has<00:04:43.169> changed

00:04:43.790 --> 00:04:43.800 
dies or at least has changed

00:04:43.800 --> 00:04:46.760 
dies or at least has changed
substantially<00:04:44.659> then<00:04:45.659> it<00:04:45.960> seems<00:04:46.530> very

00:04:46.760 --> 00:04:46.770 
substantially then it seems very

00:04:46.770 --> 00:04:49.490 
substantially then it seems very
difficult<00:04:46.919> to<00:04:47.990> interest<00:04:48.990> a<00:04:49.139> lot<00:04:49.259> of<00:04:49.320> the

00:04:49.490 --> 00:04:49.500 
difficult to interest a lot of the

00:04:49.500 --> 00:04:51.920 
difficult to interest a lot of the
popular<00:04:49.889> media<00:04:50.009> and<00:04:50.490> I<00:04:50.639> I<00:04:50.940> regret<00:04:51.419> that<00:04:51.570> and<00:04:51.810> I

00:04:51.920 --> 00:04:51.930 
popular media and I I regret that and I

00:04:51.930 --> 00:04:55.430 
popular media and I I regret that and I
would<00:04:52.380> like<00:04:52.590> to<00:04:53.180> explain<00:04:54.180> more<00:04:54.419> what<00:04:54.750> has

00:04:55.430 --> 00:04:55.440 
would like to explain more what has

00:04:55.440 --> 00:04:57.350 
would like to explain more what has
happened<00:04:55.860> because<00:04:56.009> we<00:04:56.460> have<00:04:56.669> got<00:04:56.820> to<00:04:57.000> prepare

00:04:57.350 --> 00:04:57.360 
happened because we have got to prepare

00:04:57.360 --> 00:04:59.960 
happened because we have got to prepare
for<00:04:57.419> it<00:04:57.659> it's<00:04:57.900> a<00:04:57.960> major<00:04:58.199> disaster<00:04:58.770> a<00:04:59.280> lot<00:04:59.880> of

00:04:59.960 --> 00:04:59.970 
for it it's a major disaster a lot of

00:04:59.970 --> 00:05:02.450 
for it it's a major disaster a lot of
