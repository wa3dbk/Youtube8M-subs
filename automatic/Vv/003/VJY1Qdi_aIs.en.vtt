00:00:21.330 --> 00:00:24.989
 Ethiopia, of course, did not seem to have time for about 70 minutes 

00:00:24.989 --> 00:00:29.220

 the runners from East Africa in the first 8 years came the winner 

00:00:41.359 --> 00:00:45.680
 is going out year this year he was supposed to tear this series 

00:00:45.680 --> 00:00:48.970
 because especially the representatives from Ethiopia presented themselves on this 

00:00:48.970 --> 00:00:53.430
 Day in great shape he departed Timo's watch and his compatriot was Regus f 

00:00:53.430 --> 00:00:57.760
 both in the orange jersey formed at kilometer 17 at Potsdamer Platz 

00:00:57.760 --> 00:01:01.040

 leinfelden-echterdingen in the circle a jersey with the number 15 

00:01:13.920 --> 00:01:16.909
 In the last few meters the ski tour Wondimu finally had the 

00:01:16.909 --> 00:01:21.240
 Best reserves down in the sprint came just against the Kenyan Quixote 

00:01:21.240 --> 00:01:26.119
 by his time an hour under 16 seconds Mayer was at the changeable 

00:01:26.119 --> 00:01:27.660
 Weather not in there 

00:01:27.660 --> 00:01:31.840
 three minutes later Martin Beckmann came in as nineteenth 

00:01:31.840 --> 00:01:34.440
 his time 63 53 

00:01:34.440 --> 00:01:37.140

00:01:37.140 --> 00:01:38.670
 Best Performance 

00:01:38.670 --> 00:01:41.030
 Surely not all Dresdner can run them so fast 

00:01:41.030 --> 00:01:44.880
 but as I said no need to be good because the tundra is the add-on 

00:01:44.880 --> 00:01:45.820
 shelves 

00:01:45.820 --> 00:01:49.640
 then he has to use the chance and keep it up 

00:01:49.640 --> 00:01:52.910
 Rostock to endangered singers it is sometimes more harmful than companion Isseler

 Broadcasters but as said West side and for Suu Kyi 

00:01:56.330 --> 00:01:59.980
 For the ladies it was also exciting for a long time as this young Kenyan woman 

00:01:59.980 --> 00:02:01.220
 could settle 

00:02:01.220 --> 00:02:05.440
 What Anja Kipp Ullrich came up with the mix of wind rain and sun best 

00:02:05.440 --> 00:02:08.440
 rightly strong idea of ​​the 21-year-olds 

00:02:09.639 --> 00:02:13.889
 Sabrina Mockenhaupt could not quite follow this pace after being in the winter 

00:02:13.889 --> 00:02:17.459
 did not train as usual they still lack the necessary speed hardness 

00:02:17.459 --> 00:02:20.539
 to dominate such a race 

00:02:20.539 --> 00:02:26.039

 only another 7 seconds behind ranked Sabrina Mockenhaupt the third 

00:02:33.209 --> 00:02:36.780
 At the end, it had really accelerated again and almost filled the gap 

00:02:36.779 --> 00:02:42.840
 but almost only 695 enough to reach a German 

00:02:42.840 --> 00:02:44.669
 Jahresbestleistung 

00:02:44.669 --> 00:02:46.569
 after the long winter 

00:02:46.569 --> 00:02:51.009
 Without my Bundeswehr student Bayern my last master of the ESC makes the 

00:02:51.009 --> 00:02:54.239
 correct position determination because you can build on it 

00:02:54.239 --> 00:02:57.540
 Of course I'm more than where others have I just noticed and Werner 

00:02:57.540 --> 00:03:02.680
 Man strength Obama I'm sick and satisfied with a wheelchair user 

00:03:02.680 --> 00:03:06.659

 but in children young people access to animals plants easier 

00:03:37.709 --> 00:03:40.959
