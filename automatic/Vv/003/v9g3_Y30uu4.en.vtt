they<00:00:44.489> really<00:00:44.640> don't<00:00:44.969> have<00:00:45.059> to<00:00:45.210> be<00:00:45.300> pretty<00:00:45.480> cut

00:00:46.430 --> 00:00:46.440 
they really don't have to be pretty cut

they really don't have to be pretty cut
45<00:00:46.739> degree<00:00:47.129> angles<00:00:47.460> in<00:00:47.579> each<00:00:47.670> end<00:00:47.969> and<00:00:48.239> you<00:00:48.719> can

00:00:48.830 --> 00:00:48.840 
45 degree angles in each end and you can

00:00:48.840 --> 00:00:50.660 
45 degree angles in each end and you can
make<00:00:48.989> a<00:00:49.020> essentially<00:00:49.860> a<00:00:49.890> picture<00:00:50.219> frame<00:00:50.460> on

00:00:50.660 --> 00:00:50.670 
make a essentially a picture frame on

the ground not only the base of your
ball<00:00:52.230> box<00:00:52.469> and<00:00:52.829> there's<00:00:53.489> a<00:00:53.550> frame<00:00:53.910> now<00:00:54.390> I'm

00:00:54.500 --> 00:00:54.510 
ball box and there's a frame now I'm

00:00:54.510 --> 00:00:56.330 
ball box and there's a frame now I'm
gonna<00:00:54.660> frame<00:00:54.930> out<00:00:55.110> the<00:00:55.289> sloped<00:00:55.649> sides<00:00:55.949> of<00:00:56.250> the

00:00:56.330 --> 00:00:56.340 
gonna frame out the sloped sides of the

00:00:56.340 --> 00:00:58.790 
gonna frame out the sloped sides of the
box<00:00:56.660> usually<00:00:57.660> we<00:00:57.780> use<00:00:57.809> it<00:00:58.079> on<00:00:58.170> a<00:00:58.230> 15<00:00:58.649> degree

00:00:58.790 --> 00:00:58.800 
box usually we use it on a 15 degree

00:00:58.800 --> 00:01:01.310 
box usually we use it on a 15 degree
angle<00:00:58.980> for<00:00:59.550> our<00:00:59.640> standard<00:01:00.030> vault<00:01:00.270> boxes<00:01:00.690> but<00:01:01.289> I

00:01:01.310 --> 00:01:01.320 
angle for our standard vault boxes but I

00:01:01.320 --> 00:01:02.990 
angle for our standard vault boxes but I
want<00:01:01.559> the<00:01:01.680> sides<00:01:01.920> to<00:01:02.160> be<00:01:02.250> a<00:01:02.280> little<00:01:02.550> steeper

00:01:02.990 --> 00:01:03.000 
want the sides to be a little steeper

00:01:03.000 --> 00:01:05.509 
want the sides to be a little steeper
and<00:01:03.149> the<00:01:03.570> top<00:01:03.809> to<00:01:04.140> be<00:01:04.260> a<00:01:04.290> little<00:01:04.500> wider<00:01:04.769> so<00:01:05.430> I'm

00:01:05.509 --> 00:01:05.519 
and the top to be a little wider so I'm

00:01:05.519 --> 00:01:07.070 
and the top to be a little wider so I'm
going<00:01:05.670> to<00:01:05.729> use<00:01:05.850> 10<00:01:06.119> degrees<00:01:06.450> and<00:01:06.750> see<00:01:06.960> where

00:01:07.070 --> 00:01:07.080 
going to use 10 degrees and see where

00:01:07.080 --> 00:01:17.859 
going to use 10 degrees and see where
that<00:01:07.170> gets<00:01:07.320> me

00:01:17.859 --> 00:01:17.869 

00:01:17.869 --> 00:01:20.570 

so<00:01:18.869> there's<00:01:19.080> a<00:01:19.140> frame<00:01:19.380> now<00:01:20.189> I'm<00:01:20.340> going<00:01:20.490> to

00:01:20.570 --> 00:01:20.580 
so there's a frame now I'm going to

00:01:20.580 --> 00:01:22.910 
so there's a frame now I'm going to
shoot<00:01:20.759> the<00:01:21.090> faces<00:01:21.659> and<00:01:21.930> top<00:01:22.140> with<00:01:22.590> whatever

00:01:22.910 --> 00:01:22.920 
shoot the faces and top with whatever

00:01:22.920 --> 00:01:25.789 
shoot the faces and top with whatever
scrap<00:01:23.400> ply<00:01:23.700> can<00:01:24.030> find<00:01:24.270> just<00:01:24.600> making<00:01:24.990> sure<00:01:25.229> that

00:01:25.789 --> 00:01:25.799 
scrap ply can find just making sure that

00:01:25.799 --> 00:01:28.340 
scrap ply can find just making sure that
each<00:01:26.009> edge<00:01:26.310> of<00:01:26.580> the<00:01:26.729> ply<00:01:27.000> gets<00:01:27.659> screwed<00:01:28.140> into

00:01:28.340 --> 00:01:28.350 
each edge of the ply gets screwed into

00:01:28.350 --> 00:01:30.679 
each edge of the ply gets screwed into
the<00:01:28.560> studs<00:01:28.890> world's<00:01:29.549> ugliest<00:01:29.670> ball<00:01:30.180> box

and<00:01:59.159> when<00:01:59.819> you<00:01:59.909> stack<00:02:00.270> it<00:02:00.450> up<00:02:00.569> I'm<00:02:00.780> gonna<00:02:00.929> stack

00:02:01.160 --> 00:02:01.170 
and when you stack it up I'm gonna stack

00:02:01.170 --> 00:02:03.200 
and when you stack it up I'm gonna stack
without<00:02:01.319> five<00:02:01.740> layers<00:02:02.100> it<00:02:02.789> actually

00:02:03.200 --> 00:02:03.210 
without five layers it actually

00:02:03.210 --> 00:02:05.029 
without five layers it actually
increases<00:02:03.780> the<00:02:04.050> bounce<00:02:04.289> with<00:02:04.590> each<00:02:04.800> layer

00:02:05.029 --> 00:02:05.039 
increases the bounce with each layer

00:02:05.039 --> 00:02:07.160 
increases the bounce with each layer
that<00:02:05.310> you<00:02:05.399> put<00:02:05.640> on<00:02:05.789> so<00:02:06.420> you<00:02:06.509> can<00:02:06.659> pledge<00:02:06.899> it<00:02:07.080> off

00:02:07.160 --> 00:02:07.170 
that you put on so you can pledge it off

00:02:07.170 --> 00:02:08.690 
that you put on so you can pledge it off
of<00:02:07.319> this<00:02:07.440> thing<00:02:07.649> and<00:02:07.799> it<00:02:07.920> almost<00:02:08.039> acts<00:02:08.369> like<00:02:08.549> a

00:02:08.690 --> 00:02:08.700 
of this thing and it almost acts like a

00:02:08.700 --> 00:02:11.479 
of this thing and it almost acts like a
mini<00:02:08.910> screen<00:02:09.299> the<00:02:09.959> second<00:02:10.470> we<00:02:11.069> have<00:02:11.250> this

00:02:11.479 --> 00:02:11.489 
mini screen the second we have this

00:02:11.489 --> 00:02:16.430 
mini screen the second we have this
which<00:02:12.480> is<00:02:12.510> is<00:02:12.989> just<00:02:13.560> final<00:02:14.040> family<00:02:15.019> it's<00:02:16.019> 18

00:02:16.430 --> 00:02:16.440 
which is is just final family it's 18

00:02:16.440 --> 00:02:19.580 
which is is just final family it's 18
outs<00:02:16.620> and<00:02:17.069> we<00:02:17.220> got<00:02:17.430> it<00:02:17.640> at<00:02:17.850> a<00:02:18.049> sort<00:02:19.049> of<00:02:19.110> pro

00:02:19.580 --> 00:02:19.590 
outs and we got it at a sort of pro

00:02:19.590 --> 00:02:22.009 
outs and we got it at a sort of pro
outdoor<00:02:20.250> fabric<00:02:20.820> store<00:02:21.150> the<00:02:21.540> kind<00:02:21.720> of<00:02:21.780> place

00:02:22.009 --> 00:02:22.019 
outdoor fabric store the kind of place

00:02:22.019 --> 00:02:23.840 
outdoor fabric store the kind of place
that<00:02:22.049> would<00:02:22.320> sell<00:02:22.560> upholstery<00:02:23.280> food<00:02:23.579> boats

00:02:23.840 --> 00:02:23.850 
that would sell upholstery food boats

00:02:23.850 --> 00:02:24.860 
that would sell upholstery food boats
and<00:02:24.180> things<00:02:24.299> like

00:02:24.860 --> 00:02:24.870 
and things like

00:02:24.870 --> 00:02:26.660 
and things like
so<00:02:25.410> now<00:02:25.530> I'm<00:02:25.620> going<00:02:25.800> to<00:02:25.860> start<00:02:26.069> measuring<00:02:26.340> out

00:02:26.660 --> 00:02:26.670 
so now I'm going to start measuring out

00:02:26.670 --> 00:02:28.520 
so now I'm going to start measuring out
the<00:02:26.700> phone<00:02:27.090> and<00:02:27.510> you<00:02:27.900> can<00:02:28.050> see<00:02:28.260> what<00:02:28.410> I'm

00:02:28.520 --> 00:02:28.530 
the phone and you can see what I'm

00:02:28.530 --> 00:02:30.380 
the phone and you can see what I'm
trying<00:02:28.769> to<00:02:28.830> do<00:02:29.010> here<00:02:29.340> is<00:02:29.489> just<00:02:29.519> let<00:02:29.940> it<00:02:30.060> great

00:02:30.380 --> 00:02:30.390 
trying to do here is just let it great

00:02:30.390 --> 00:02:32.600 
trying to do here is just let it great
so<00:02:30.870> it<00:02:31.080> creates<00:02:31.500> these<00:02:31.680> pockets<00:02:32.250> up<00:02:32.370> here<00:02:32.400> at

00:02:32.600 --> 00:02:32.610 
so it creates these pockets up here at

00:02:32.610 --> 00:02:34.759 
so it creates these pockets up here at
the<00:02:32.700> top<00:02:32.940> and<00:02:33.480> on<00:02:33.629> the<00:02:33.660> sides<00:02:34.019> you'll<00:02:34.410> see<00:02:34.620> why

00:02:34.759 --> 00:02:34.769 
the top and on the sides you'll see why

00:02:34.769 --> 00:02:36.949 
the top and on the sides you'll see why
in<00:02:34.920> a<00:02:35.010> minute<00:02:35.129> then<00:02:36.090> when<00:02:36.239> I<00:02:36.300> get<00:02:36.360> it<00:02:36.569> lined<00:02:36.750> up

00:02:36.949 --> 00:02:36.959 
in a minute then when I get it lined up

00:02:36.959 --> 00:02:38.300 
in a minute then when I get it lined up
I'm<00:02:37.349> just<00:02:37.590> going<00:02:37.739> to<00:02:37.769> draw<00:02:37.980> a<00:02:38.010> line<00:02:38.190> across

00:02:38.300 --> 00:02:38.310 
I'm just going to draw a line across

00:02:38.310 --> 00:02:40.009 
I'm just going to draw a line across
with<00:02:38.670> a<00:02:38.730> straight<00:02:39.000> edge<00:02:39.150> and<00:02:39.360> cut<00:02:39.840> it<00:02:39.989> just

00:02:40.009 --> 00:02:40.019 
with a straight edge and cut it just

00:02:40.019 --> 00:02:42.140 
with a straight edge and cut it just
with<00:02:40.260> a<00:02:40.349> simple<00:02:40.560> pocketknife<00:02:41.220> when<00:02:42.000> you're

00:02:42.140 --> 00:02:42.150 
with a simple pocketknife when you're

00:02:42.150 --> 00:02:43.820 
with a simple pocketknife when you're
cutting<00:02:42.480> it<00:02:42.599> you<00:02:42.810> want<00:02:43.290> to<00:02:43.349> make<00:02:43.470> sure<00:02:43.680> that

00:02:43.820 --> 00:02:43.830 
cutting it you want to make sure that

00:02:43.830 --> 00:02:45.710 
cutting it you want to make sure that
you're<00:02:43.980> playing<00:02:44.310> it<00:02:44.519> as<00:02:45.000> flat<00:02:45.420> as<00:02:45.690> possible

00:02:45.710 --> 00:02:45.720 
you're playing it as flat as possible

00:02:45.720 --> 00:02:48.410 
you're playing it as flat as possible
and<00:02:46.709> dragging<00:02:47.400> along<00:02:47.670> with<00:02:47.879> a<00:02:47.940> good<00:02:48.090> amount<00:02:48.360> of

00:02:48.410 --> 00:02:48.420 
and dragging along with a good amount of

00:02:48.420 --> 00:02:49.820 
and dragging along with a good amount of
force<00:02:48.720> that<00:02:48.959> will<00:02:49.019> give<00:02:49.170> you<00:02:49.230> a<00:02:49.290> much<00:02:49.410> cleaner

00:02:49.820 --> 00:02:49.830 
force that will give you a much cleaner

00:02:49.830 --> 00:02:52.369 
force that will give you a much cleaner
cut<00:02:50.250> than<00:02:50.670> pressing<00:02:51.000> down<00:02:51.299> the<00:02:51.330> tip<00:02:51.930> we're

00:02:52.369 --> 00:02:52.379 
cut than pressing down the tip we're

00:02:52.379 --> 00:02:54.440 
cut than pressing down the tip we're
trying<00:02:52.650> to<00:02:52.799> solve<00:02:53.129> through<00:02:53.519> I'm<00:02:54.209> going<00:02:54.360> to

00:02:54.440 --> 00:02:54.450 
trying to solve through I'm going to

00:02:54.450 --> 00:02:56.150 
trying to solve through I'm going to
repeat<00:02:54.720> this<00:02:54.900> process<00:02:54.959> until<00:02:55.560> I<00:02:55.739> have<00:02:55.860> five

00:02:56.150 --> 00:02:56.160 
repeat this process until I have five

00:02:56.160 --> 00:02:58.220 
repeat this process until I have five
pieces<00:02:56.519> of<00:02:56.819> foam<00:02:57.030> and<00:02:57.420> each<00:02:57.599> time<00:02:57.840> I<00:02:57.870> do<00:02:57.989> this

00:02:58.220 --> 00:02:58.230 
pieces of foam and each time I do this

00:02:58.230 --> 00:03:00.410 
pieces of foam and each time I do this
instead<00:02:58.620> of<00:02:58.739> cutting<00:02:59.010> five<00:02:59.430> of<00:02:59.940> the<00:03:00.150> same

00:03:00.410 --> 00:03:00.420 
instead of cutting five of the same

00:03:00.420 --> 00:03:02.000 
instead of cutting five of the same
sized<00:03:00.720> pieces<00:03:01.049> I'm<00:03:01.319> going<00:03:01.500> to<00:03:01.560> be<00:03:01.739> measure

00:03:02.000 --> 00:03:02.010 
sized pieces I'm going to be measure

00:03:02.010 --> 00:03:04.370 
sized pieces I'm going to be measure
because<00:03:02.670> each<00:03:03.030> subsequent<00:03:03.390> piece<00:03:03.750> of<00:03:03.930> foam<00:03:04.170> is

00:03:04.370 --> 00:03:04.380 
because each subsequent piece of foam is

00:03:04.380 --> 00:03:07.309 
because each subsequent piece of foam is
draping<00:03:04.860> over<00:03:04.980> a<00:03:05.160> slightly<00:03:05.579> larger<00:03:05.880> area<00:03:06.450> now

00:03:07.309 --> 00:03:07.319

comes<00:03:07.560> along<00:03:07.890> and<00:03:08.190> frankly<00:03:08.610> rather<00:03:08.790> tedious

00:03:09.199 --> 00:03:09.209 
comes along and frankly rather tedious

00:03:09.209 --> 00:03:11.930 
comes along and frankly rather tedious
bit<00:03:09.720> we're<00:03:10.319> gonna<00:03:10.379> take<00:03:10.739> small<00:03:11.340> pieces<00:03:11.610> of

00:03:11.930 --> 00:03:11.940 
bit we're gonna take small pieces of

00:03:11.940 --> 00:03:14.059 
bit we're gonna take small pieces of
foam<00:03:12.209> and<00:03:12.599> stuff<00:03:13.049> them<00:03:13.260> into<00:03:13.410> the<00:03:13.590> pockets

00:03:14.059 --> 00:03:14.069 
foam and stuff them into the pockets

00:03:14.069 --> 00:03:15.920 
foam and stuff them into the pockets
created<00:03:14.579> when<00:03:14.730> we<00:03:14.849> draped<00:03:15.239> the<00:03:15.450> layers<00:03:15.629> of

foam over the vault box the goal here is

00:03:18.780 --> 00:03:20.569 
foam over the vault box the goal here is
to<00:03:18.810> make<00:03:18.959> the<00:03:19.200> side<00:03:19.440> stiff<00:03:20.129> so<00:03:20.340> they<00:03:20.400> don't

00:03:20.569 --> 00:03:20.579 
to make the side stiff so they don't

00:03:20.579 --> 00:03:22.460 
to make the side stiff so they don't
squish<00:03:20.970> in<00:03:21.180> when<00:03:21.360> you<00:03:21.480> kick<00:03:21.720> it<00:03:21.900> without

all the foam laid down you're gonna pull

the<00:03:36.329> parts<00:03:36.690> where<00:03:37.049> it<00:03:37.139> opens<00:03:37.590> so<00:03:38.430> everything

00:03:38.900 --> 00:03:38.910 
the parts where it opens so everything

00:03:38.910 --> 00:03:40.370 
the parts where it opens so everything
is<00:03:38.970> constructed<00:03:39.540> and<00:03:39.660> we<00:03:39.720> have<00:03:39.840> a<00:03:39.870> base<00:03:40.109> plate

00:03:40.370 --> 00:03:40.380 
is constructed and we have a base plate

00:03:40.380 --> 00:03:42.559 
is constructed and we have a base plate
attached<00:03:40.739> and<00:03:41.099> now<00:03:41.639> basically<00:03:42.030> what<00:03:42.299> we<00:03:42.420> did

00:03:42.559 --> 00:03:42.569 
attached and now basically what we did

00:03:42.569 --> 00:03:44.620 
attached and now basically what we did
is<00:03:42.690> we<00:03:42.720> went<00:03:43.019> in<00:03:43.109> and<00:03:43.230> made<00:03:43.440> it<00:03:43.560> really<00:03:43.889> heavy

00:03:44.620 --> 00:03:44.630 
is we went in and made it really heavy

00:03:44.630 --> 00:03:47.240 
is we went in and made it really heavy
the<00:03:45.630> process<00:03:46.139> for<00:03:46.290> this<00:03:46.380> is<00:03:46.560> gonna<00:03:46.709> vary<00:03:46.980> based

00:03:47.240 --> 00:03:47.250 
the process for this is gonna vary based

00:03:47.250 --> 00:03:50.059 
the process for this is gonna vary based
on<00:03:47.579> the<00:03:47.940> type<00:03:48.060> of<00:03:48.480> weight<00:03:48.810> you<00:03:49.019> have<00:03:49.290> in<00:03:49.620> our

00:03:50.059 --> 00:03:50.069 
on the type of weight you have in our

00:03:50.069 --> 00:03:53.509 
on the type of weight you have in our
case<00:03:50.340> we<00:03:50.579> had<00:03:50.760> these<00:03:50.880> nice<00:03:51.530> 30<00:03:52.530> pound<00:03:52.889> bricks

00:03:53.509 --> 00:03:53.519 
case we had these nice 30 pound bricks

00:03:53.519 --> 00:03:56.509 
case we had these nice 30 pound bricks
we<00:03:54.359> put<00:03:54.599> three<00:03:54.959> in<00:03:54.989> this<00:03:55.230> corner<00:03:55.680> three<00:03:56.430> in

00:03:56.509 --> 00:03:56.519 
we put three in this corner three in

00:03:56.519 --> 00:03:58.430 
we put three in this corner three in
this<00:03:56.669> corner<00:03:57.090> and<00:03:57.269> then<00:03:57.389> we<00:03:57.510> lined<00:03:57.840> the<00:03:58.230> bottom

00:03:58.430 --> 00:03:58.440 
this corner and then we lined the bottom

00:03:58.440 --> 00:04:01.009 
this corner and then we lined the bottom
with<00:03:59.190> with<00:03:59.940> plate<00:04:00.239> weight<00:04:00.480> that<00:04:00.780> you<00:04:00.900> would

00:04:01.009 --> 00:04:01.019 
with with plate weight that you would

00:04:01.019 --> 00:04:02.839 
with with plate weight that you would
use<00:04:01.169> for<00:04:01.200> weight<00:04:01.590> lifting<00:04:01.980> and<00:04:02.160> this<00:04:02.639> thing<00:04:02.760> is

00:04:02.839 --> 00:04:02.849 
use for weight lifting and this thing is

00:04:02.849 --> 00:04:05.629 
use for weight lifting and this thing is
really<00:04:03.269> really<00:04:03.720> heavy<00:04:03.959> now<00:04:04.139> it's<00:04:04.889> very

00:04:05.629 --> 00:04:05.639 
really really heavy now it's very

00:04:05.639 --> 00:04:07.250 
really really heavy now it's very
difficult<00:04:06.030> to<00:04:06.180> tip<00:04:06.450> which<00:04:06.690> makes<00:04:06.900> it<00:04:07.049> good<00:04:07.200> for

00:04:07.250 --> 00:04:07.260 
difficult to tip which makes it good for

00:04:07.260 --> 00:04:10.490 
difficult to tip which makes it good for
doing<00:04:07.590> things<00:04:07.829> like<00:04:07.889> wall<00:04:08.190> flips<00:04:09.109> to<00:04:10.109> cover<00:04:10.319> up

00:04:10.490 --> 00:04:10.500 
doing things like wall flips to cover up

00:04:10.500 --> 00:04:12.800 
doing things like wall flips to cover up
the<00:04:10.650> stable<00:04:11.069> seam<00:04:11.310> and<00:04:11.609> add<00:04:12.060> to<00:04:12.299> the<00:04:12.419> strength

00:04:12.800 --> 00:04:12.810 
the stable seam and add to the strength

00:04:12.810 --> 00:04:13.640 
the stable seam and add to the strength
of

00:04:13.640 --> 00:04:13.650 
of

00:04:13.650 --> 00:04:16.460 
of
the<00:04:13.920> vinyl<00:04:14.250> we're<00:04:15.209> taking<00:04:15.599> basically<00:04:16.019> two

00:04:16.460 --> 00:04:16.470 
the vinyl we're taking basically two

00:04:16.470 --> 00:04:19.340 
the vinyl we're taking basically two
trapezoids<00:04:17.220> in<00:04:17.519> the<00:04:17.699> shape<00:04:18.000> and<00:04:18.269> size<00:04:18.870> of<00:04:19.229> the

00:04:19.340 --> 00:04:19.350 
trapezoids in the shape and size of the

00:04:19.350 --> 00:04:22.120 
trapezoids in the shape and size of the
original<00:04:19.799> frame<00:04:20.359> cutting<00:04:21.359> them<00:04:21.479> out<00:04:21.570> and

00:04:22.120 --> 00:04:22.130 
original frame cutting them out and

00:04:22.130 --> 00:04:24.710 
original frame cutting them out and
attaching<00:04:23.130> them<00:04:23.250> here<00:04:23.639> and<00:04:23.790> then<00:04:24.330> before<00:04:24.570> we

00:04:24.710 --> 00:04:24.720 
attaching them here and then before we

00:04:24.720 --> 00:04:26.840 
attaching them here and then before we
do<00:04:24.900> that<00:04:24.930> I'm<00:04:25.290> going<00:04:25.470> to<00:04:25.530> route<00:04:25.800> the<00:04:26.490> edges

00:04:26.840 --> 00:04:26.850 
do that I'm going to route the edges

00:04:26.850 --> 00:04:29.240 
do that I'm going to route the edges
here<00:04:27.120> I'm<00:04:27.870> going<00:04:28.050> to<00:04:28.139> cut<00:04:28.350> and<00:04:28.530> rout<00:04:28.800> a<00:04:28.830> big

00:04:29.240 --> 00:04:29.250 
here I'm going to cut and rout a big

00:04:29.250 --> 00:04:32.930 
here I'm going to cut and rout a big
handhold<00:04:29.910> slash<00:04:30.419> window<00:04:30.960> in<00:04:31.260> the<00:04:31.470> bottom<00:04:31.940> and

00:04:32.930 --> 00:04:32.940 
handhold slash window in the bottom and

00:04:32.940 --> 00:04:39.390 
handhold slash window in the bottom and
then<00:04:33.510> I'm<00:04:33.600> going<00:04:33.720> to<00:04:33.810> paint<00:04:34.620> it<00:04:34.800> and<00:04:35.010> finish<00:04:35.580> it

00:04:39.390 --> 00:04:39.400 

00:04:39.400 --> 00:04:41.280 

a<00:04:39.430> lot<00:04:39.729> of<00:04:39.850> lateral<00:04:40.060> stability<00:04:40.479> because<00:04:41.139> they

00:04:41.280 --> 00:04:41.290 
a lot of lateral stability because they

00:04:41.290 --> 00:04:43.620 
a lot of lateral stability because they
tie<00:04:41.560> the<00:04:41.620> frame<00:04:42.100> the<00:04:42.520> base<00:04:42.729> and<00:04:43.030> the<00:04:43.090> top<00:04:43.120> all

00:04:43.620 --> 00:04:43.630 
tie the frame the base and the top all

00:04:43.630 --> 00:04:45.330 
tie the frame the base and the top all
together<00:04:43.840> because<00:04:44.740> we're<00:04:44.979> gonna<00:04:45.070> be<00:04:45.220> hitting

00:04:45.330 --> 00:04:45.340 
together because we're gonna be hitting

00:04:45.340 --> 00:04:47.790 
together because we're gonna be hitting
this<00:04:45.580> box<00:04:45.820> really<00:04:46.180> hard<00:04:46.479> and<00:04:46.780> because<00:04:47.500> we<00:04:47.650> have

00:04:47.790 --> 00:04:47.800 
this box really hard and because we have
