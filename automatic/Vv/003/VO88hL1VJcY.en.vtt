the best option for V Oppo find 7 but
that<00:03:22.530> would<00:03:22.680> really<00:03:22.920> make<00:03:23.160> it<00:03:23.220> a<00:03:23.519> 2k<00:03:24.060> 1<00:03:24.360> plus<00:03:24.690> 1

all really simple now on to the cameras
let's<00:03:41.700> start<00:03:41.940> with<00:03:42.060> the<00:03:42.120> front-facing<00:03:42.420> camera

00:03:43.009 --> 00:03:43.019 
let's start with the front-facing camera

00:03:43.019 --> 00:03:45.140 
let's start with the front-facing camera
for<00:03:43.049> your<00:03:43.290> selfie<00:03:43.739> people<00:03:44.100> unlike<00:03:44.820> most

for your selfie people unlike most

00:03:45.150 --> 00:03:47.660 
for your selfie people unlike most
phones<00:03:45.510> you'll<00:03:45.840> find<00:03:46.110> a<00:03:46.320> 5<00:03:46.650> megapixel<00:03:47.100> front

00:03:47.660 --> 00:03:47.670 
phones you'll find a 5 megapixel front

00:03:47.670 --> 00:03:49.789 
phones you'll find a 5 megapixel front
facing<00:03:47.730> camera<00:03:48.600> much<00:03:49.200> more<00:03:49.440> resolution

00:03:54.979 --> 00:03:54.989 
camera on most flat ships the quality is

00:03:54.989 --> 00:03:56.930 
camera on most flat ships the quality is
actually<00:03:55.200> pretty<00:03:55.799> good<00:03:56.130> the<00:03:56.400> colors<00:03:56.790> were

00:03:56.930 --> 00:03:56.940 
actually pretty good the colors were

actually pretty good the colors were
pretty<00:03:57.180> balanced<00:03:57.750> but<00:03:58.230> it<00:03:58.350> doesn't<00:03:58.650> like<00:03:58.769> to

00:03:58.789 --> 00:03:58.799 
pretty balanced but it doesn't like to

00:03:58.799 --> 00:04:00.530 
pretty balanced but it doesn't like to
expose<00:03:59.280> properly<00:03:59.850> so<00:03:59.970> you<00:04:00.060> might<00:04:00.209> want<00:04:00.390> to<00:04:00.420> be

00:04:00.530 --> 00:04:00.540 
expose properly so you might want to be

00:04:00.540 --> 00:04:02.090 
expose properly so you might want to be
careful<00:04:00.780> in<00:04:01.049> differentiating<00:04:01.830> light

00:04:02.090 --> 00:04:02.100

it's<00:05:22.770> actually<00:05:23.010> much<00:05:23.669> better<00:05:24.030> than<00:05:24.210> the<00:05:24.750> LG<00:05:25.230> g3

00:05:25.550 --> 00:05:25.560 
it's actually much better than the LG g3

it's actually much better than the LG g3
just<00:05:26.460> a<00:05:26.610> very<00:05:27.000> solid<00:05:27.510> feeling<00:05:27.900> phone<00:05:28.080> in<00:05:28.290> the

00:05:28.340 --> 00:05:28.350 
just a very solid feeling phone in the

just a very solid feeling phone in the
hand<00:05:28.650> I<00:05:28.950> don't<00:05:29.700> mind<00:05:29.910> the<00:05:30.090> haft<00:05:30.360> of<00:05:30.540> this

00:05:30.680 --> 00:05:30.690

00:05:30.690 --> 00:05:33.230 
hand I don't mind the haft of this
device<00:05:31.020> but<00:05:31.440> I<00:05:31.500> do<00:05:31.620> mind<00:05:32.160> the<00:05:32.370> bezels<00:05:32.790> and<00:05:33.000> the

00:05:33.230 --> 00:05:33.240 
device but I do mind the bezels and the

00:05:33.240 --> 00:05:33.980 
device but I do mind the bezels and the
size

00:05:33.980 --> 00:05:33.990 
size

00:05:33.990 --> 00:05:35.600 
size
I<00:05:34.020> wish<00:05:34.470> there<00:05:34.680> is<00:05:34.770> the<00:05:34.860> best<00:05:35.100> of<00:05:35.250> both<00:05:35.310> worlds

00:05:35.600 --> 00:05:35.610 
I wish there is the best of both worlds

00:05:35.610 --> 00:05:38.270 
I wish there is the best of both worlds
of<00:05:35.850> combining<00:05:36.240> the<00:05:36.450> LG<00:05:36.990> g3<00:05:37.229> size<00:05:37.770> and<00:05:38.070> the

00:05:38.270 --> 00:05:38.280 
of combining the LG g3 size and the

00:05:38.280 --> 00:05:41.090 
of combining the LG g3 size and the
build<00:05:38.550> quality<00:05:38.760> from<00:05:39.270> this<00:05:39.479> Oppo<00:05:39.930> find<00:05:40.169> 7<00:05:40.320> but

00:05:41.090 --> 00:05:41.100 
build quality from this Oppo find 7 but

00:05:41.100 --> 00:05:43.700 
build quality from this Oppo find 7 but
that<00:05:41.280> does<00:05:41.430> not<00:05:41.610> exist<00:05:42.330> and<00:05:42.660> don't<00:05:43.260> think<00:05:43.530> this

00:05:43.700 --> 00:05:43.710 
that does not exist and don't think this

00:05:43.710 --> 00:05:45.800 
that does not exist and don't think this
phone<00:05:43.950> is<00:05:44.100> cheaper<00:05:44.580> either<00:05:44.820> it<00:05:45.210> will<00:05:45.300> cost<00:05:45.540> you

00:05:45.800 --> 00:05:45.810 
phone is cheaper either it will cost you

00:05:45.810 --> 00:05:47.750 
phone is cheaper either it will cost you
a<00:05:45.840> pretty<00:05:46.080> penny<00:05:46.229> just<00:05:46.890> about<00:05:47.100> the<00:05:47.250> same<00:05:47.520> as

00:05:47.750 --> 00:05:47.760 
a pretty penny just about the same as

00:05:47.760 --> 00:05:50.420 
a pretty penny just about the same as
your<00:05:48.120> LG<00:05:48.300> g3<00:05:48.750> off-contract<00:05:49.740> when<00:05:50.010> it<00:05:50.100> hits<00:05:50.280> our

00:05:52.670 --> 00:05:52.680 
shores in a few days but you have to

00:05:52.680 --> 00:05:54.560 
shores in a few days but you have to
remember<00:05:52.979> the<00:05:53.310> software<00:05:53.910> is<00:05:54.060> where<00:05:54.360> it's

00:05:54.560 --> 00:05:54.570 
remember the software is where it's

00:05:54.570 --> 00:05:56.630 
remember the software is where it's
crippled<00:05:55.110> not<00:05:55.770> to<00:05:55.979> a<00:05:56.010> point<00:05:56.340> where<00:05:56.520> it's

crippled not to a point where it's

crippled not to a point where it's
irrelevant<00:05:57.360> but<00:05:57.540> it<00:05:57.690> is<00:05:57.870> becoming<00:05:58.350> outdated

00:05:58.670 --> 00:05:58.680 
irrelevant but it is becoming outdated

00:05:58.680 --> 00:06:01.670 
irrelevant but it is becoming outdated
