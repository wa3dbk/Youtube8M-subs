00:00:17.330 --> 00:00:25.470
 we are still on land I 

00:00:22.860 --> 00:00:28.110
 sandra super serious work anyway 

00:00:25.470 --> 00:00:30.060
 tell you that potting soil where the substrate 

00:00:28.110 --> 00:00:31.230
 it's like soup for a 

00:00:30.060 --> 00:00:32.309
 supporting the balls as a soup to 

00:00:31.230 --> 00:00:34.890
 10 balls that goes beyond anything we put 

00:00:32.309 --> 00:00:36.269
 in it depends also what we want 

00:00:34.890 --> 00:00:38.160
 do external or if it's a loam 

00:00:36.269 --> 00:00:39.329
 we need for trays 5 0 when 

00:00:38.160 --> 00:00:41.010
 even from a garden point these 

00:00:39.329 --> 00:00:42.720
 interrogations for a lawn is 

00:00:41.010 --> 00:00:45.239
 also depends on the type of plant all 

00:00:42.720 --> 00:00:45.539
 depends where the plant is at 

00:00:45.239 --> 00:00:47.129
 banks 

00:00:45.539 --> 00:00:48.930
 that's why we have so many bags 

00:00:47.129 --> 00:00:50.460
 different we are lucky in Switzerland to 

00:00:48.930 --> 00:00:52.469
 tell you that we have very good 

00:00:50.460 --> 00:00:53.670
 land producers and the great 

00:00:52.469 --> 00:00:55.230
 chance we also have now the 

00:00:53.670 --> 00:00:57.269
 great fashion it's there are more tournaments 

00:00:55.230 --> 00:00:58.769
 taking the tower so strong the air all 

00:00:57.269 --> 00:01:01.109
 the ecosystem that is to say it pays 

00:00:58.769 --> 00:01:03.390
 some peat bogs and with that everything is 

00:01:01.109 --> 00:01:05.640
 modified well it's a recipe like 

00:01:03.390 --> 00:01:07.649
 a nokia soup what carrots 

00:01:05.640 --> 00:01:09.420
 raves of leeks in full of humor 

00:01:07.649 --> 00:01:11.070
 that morning then to say that he 

00:01:09.420 --> 00:01:13.259
 manufacturers they launched recipes 

00:01:11.070 --> 00:01:15.270
 that is to say dom there is argilly edge 

00:01:13.259 --> 00:01:17.160
 coconut what could it say is everyone to 

00:01:15.270 --> 00:01:19.530
 their own recipes and he'll have apt 

00:01:17.160 --> 00:01:21.030
 and and percentage for each plant due 

00:01:19.530 --> 00:01:22.830
 to do there are several kinds of quality 

00:01:21.030 --> 00:01:24.300
 so then it's getting ready for use 

00:01:22.830 --> 00:01:27.000
 you have to take it do not need vegetables and 

00:01:24.300 --> 00:01:28.890
 on a good soil you must not look 

00:01:27.000 --> 00:01:30.450
 the price because it really takes a good 

00:01:28.890 --> 00:01:32.399
 potting he still told rather dear 

00:01:30.450 --> 00:01:33.479
 you have to see the structure that the target 

00:01:32.399 --> 00:01:35.280
 slings of lathes hérault point la 

00:01:33.479 --> 00:01:36.450
 question is well structured tullaye not 

00:01:35.280 --> 00:01:38.099
 to hold a long time in his baccalaureate he is 

00:01:36.450 --> 00:01:40.800
 quiet without a paimpol potting soil 

00:01:38.099 --> 00:01:42.360
 geranium hassen terro will slip a little 

00:01:40.800 --> 00:01:44.420
 less structured that will fit for a 

00:01:42.360 --> 00:01:48.509
 season 

00:01:44.420 --> 00:01:50.159
 then see the clay balls fast and 

00:01:48.509 --> 00:01:52.619
 of clay the clay in it gives 

00:01:50.159 --> 00:01:54.030
 volume its keeps volume and kto journal 

00:01:52.619 --> 00:01:56.939
 him he is going to break down 

00:01:54.030 --> 00:02:01.530
 instead so that's the advantage of these 

00:01:56.939 --> 00:02:03.030
 potting soil for bach barça then there you 

00:02:01.530 --> 00:02:03.810
 did you understand you selebi of clay 

00:02:03.030 --> 00:02:05.549
 what we pay for it 

00:02:03.810 --> 00:02:07.770
 you surely know both 

00:02:05.549 --> 00:02:09.810
 cultures it's only a henchman 

00:02:07.770 --> 00:02:11.910
 plants grow in we watch 

00:02:09.810 --> 00:02:12.690
 the water level and then it does not move 

00:02:11.910 --> 00:02:14.220
 what else is it for 

00:02:12.690 --> 00:02:15.510
 which is great at clay kribi this the 

00:02:14.220 --> 00:02:18.329
 key to the success of all your plantations 

00:02:15.510 --> 00:02:20.010
 must not forget that these balances are the 

00:02:18.329 --> 00:02:21.480
 employees also like drainage drainage 

00:02:20.010 --> 00:02:23.370
 for a trailing box for a 

00:02:21.480 --> 00:02:23.940
 weight to if your containers that have not 

00:02:23.370 --> 00:02:26.040
 and braking 

00:02:23.940 --> 00:02:27.150
 there all the time humidity 

00:02:26.040 --> 00:02:30.480
 the water and its dreams to complaints are 

00:02:27.150 --> 00:02:33.120
 asphyxiated a few drainage 

00:02:30.480 --> 00:02:34.920
 centimeters a protective veil pack 

00:02:33.120 --> 00:02:36.989
 libya this mixture to the ground a good 

00:02:34.920 --> 00:02:37.650
 potting boxes plan and that's the 

00:02:36.989 --> 00:02:39.660
 assured success 

00:02:37.650 --> 00:02:41.730
 so that's for dummies that I do not 

00:02:39.660 --> 00:02:43.560
 it's not polished nil it had been in 

00:02:41.730 --> 00:02:45.989
 back it was fashionable archi 

00:02:43.560 --> 00:02:47.129
 come back nicely but it's true that 

00:02:45.989 --> 00:02:48.810
 it is practical that it requires more 

00:02:47.129 --> 00:02:51.209
 working only to watch 

00:02:48.810 --> 00:02:53.040
 watering a little fertilizer and it holds 

00:02:51.209 --> 00:02:55.859
 well you plant or no relatives and 

00:02:53.040 --> 00:02:57.900
 me it works for the soil of flowers 

00:02:55.859 --> 00:02:59.489
 and geraniums remember that each 

00:02:57.900 --> 00:03:02.220
 group of plants with requirements 

00:02:59.489 --> 00:03:04.650
 specific change the substrate of 

00:03:02.220 --> 00:03:06.569
 season planters each year noted 

00:03:04.650 --> 00:03:08.940
 that potting soil can survive 

00:03:06.569 --> 00:03:10.530
 many years observed the reserve of 

00:03:08.940 --> 00:03:14.010
 fertilization of the substrate and when it is 

00:03:10.530 --> 00:03:16.530
 exhausted use liquid fertilizer 

00:03:14.010 --> 00:03:18.420
 haley who also advises for those who 

00:03:16.530 --> 00:03:20.280
 plant their crates every year where 

00:03:18.420 --> 00:03:21.900
 the then geraniums every year on 

00:03:20.280 --> 00:03:23.310
 start not saved from the earth then 

00:03:21.900 --> 00:03:25.829
 one keeps the old days is the 

00:03:23.310 --> 00:03:29.030
 compos is far on the garden we use 

00:03:25.829 --> 00:03:29.030
 the land us 

00:03:31.750 --> 00:03:35.290
 of course my land
