00:00:45.100 --> 00:00:46.799 
figured out by trial and error that if
you<00:00:45.280> do<00:00:45.400> with<00:00:45.610> three<00:00:45.790> people<00:00:46.089> is<00:00:46.239> two<00:00:46.479> spots

00:00:46.799 --> 00:00:46.809 
you do with three people is two spots

everything spawn in and kill everything

00:00:53.110 --> 00:00:54.750 
everything spawn in and kill everything

and then everyone gets their awards and

00:00:54.760 --> 00:00:56.369 
and then everyone gets their awards and

00:00:56.369 --> 00:00:56.379 
you move on to next part but it's still

00:00:56.379 --> 00:00:58.229 
you move on to next part but it's still
hard<00:00:56.619> even<00:00:56.830> doing<00:00:57.220> it<00:00:57.339> this<00:00:57.460> way<00:00:57.519> if<00:00:57.879> you're

00:00:58.229 --> 00:00:58.239 
hard even doing it this way if you're

00:00:58.239 --> 00:01:00.179 
hard even doing it this way if you're
not<00:00:58.780> as<00:00:58.900> skilled<00:00:59.229> I<00:00:59.470> wasn't<00:00:59.650> playing<00:00:59.890> with<00:01:00.070> my

00:01:00.179 --> 00:01:00.189 
not as skilled I wasn't playing with my

00:01:00.189 --> 00:01:01.530 
not as skilled I wasn't playing with my
clan<00:01:00.430> tanks<00:01:00.820> and<00:01:00.939> climate<00:01:01.239> and<00:01:01.299> then<00:01:01.449> we're

00:01:01.530 --> 00:01:01.540 
clan tanks and climate and then we're

00:01:01.540 --> 00:01:03.119 
clan tanks and climate and then we're
already<00:01:01.689> booked<00:01:01.960> up<00:01:02.110> I<00:01:02.350> couldn't<00:01:02.830> get<00:01:02.949> in<00:01:03.040> with

00:01:03.119 --> 00:01:03.129 
already booked up I couldn't get in with

00:01:03.129 --> 00:01:05.160 
already booked up I couldn't get in with
them<00:01:03.250> early<00:01:03.519> so<00:01:03.729> this<00:01:04.239> is<00:01:04.390> how<00:01:04.479> we<00:01:04.629> did<00:01:04.839> it<00:01:04.869> and

00:01:05.160 --> 00:01:05.170 
them early so this is how we did it and

00:01:05.170 --> 00:01:07.050 
them early so this is how we did it and
we<00:01:06.070> did<00:01:06.220> it<00:01:06.310> with<00:01:06.430> three<00:01:06.610> men<00:01:06.760> and<00:01:06.909> it's

00:01:07.050 --> 00:01:07.060 
we did it with three men and it's

00:01:07.060 --> 00:01:08.670 
we did it with three men and it's
basically<00:01:07.210> two<00:01:07.600> spots<00:01:07.990> that<00:01:08.229> you<00:01:08.350> can<00:01:08.500> go<00:01:08.619> to

00:01:08.670 --> 00:01:08.680 
basically two spots that you can go to

00:01:08.680 --> 00:01:11.280 
basically two spots that you can go to
so<00:01:09.460> we<00:01:09.580> thought<00:01:09.610> initially<00:01:10.030> that<00:01:10.270> if<00:01:10.990> we<00:01:11.110> go<00:01:11.229> to

00:01:11.280 --> 00:01:11.290 
so we thought initially that if we go to

00:01:11.290 --> 00:01:12.870 
so we thought initially that if we go to
this<00:01:11.439> spot<00:01:11.650> here<00:01:11.920> we<00:01:12.159> could<00:01:12.310> just<00:01:12.430> stay<00:01:12.580> here

00:01:12.870 --> 00:01:12.880 
this spot here we could just stay here

00:01:12.880 --> 00:01:14.490 
this spot here we could just stay here
we<00:01:13.060> kill<00:01:13.270> everything<00:01:13.509> the<00:01:13.840> ogres<00:01:14.140> would<00:01:14.290> spawn

00:01:14.490 --> 00:01:14.500 
we kill everything the ogres would spawn

00:01:14.500 --> 00:01:16.950 
we kill everything the ogres would spawn
the<00:01:14.650> wizard<00:01:14.890> and<00:01:14.979> spawn<00:01:15.250> and<00:01:15.549> voila<00:01:16.509> we'd<00:01:16.900> be

00:01:16.950 --> 00:01:16.960 
the wizard and spawn and voila we'd be

00:01:16.960 --> 00:01:18.870 
the wizard and spawn and voila we'd be
done<00:01:17.140> no<00:01:17.409> no<00:01:17.650> no<00:01:17.770> this<00:01:18.280> is<00:01:18.460> just<00:01:18.610> one<00:01:18.730> of<00:01:18.760> the

00:01:18.870 --> 00:01:18.880 
done no no no this is just one of the

00:01:18.880 --> 00:01:20.190 
done no no no this is just one of the
spots<00:01:19.120> because<00:01:19.450> you<00:01:19.570> want<00:01:19.720> to<00:01:19.750> get<00:01:19.990> at<00:01:20.170> least

00:01:22.470 --> 00:01:22.480 
three people over here get to the spot

00:01:22.480 --> 00:01:24.000

he shoots up there so I died up there a
few<00:01:34.300> times<00:01:34.690> so<00:01:35.080> this<00:01:35.260> is<00:01:35.380> actually<00:01:35.500> the

00:01:36.110 --> 00:01:36.120 
few times so this is actually the

00:01:36.120 --> 00:01:38.310 
few times so this is actually the
successful<00:01:37.120> time<00:01:37.240> and<00:01:37.450> it<00:01:37.510> don't<00:01:38.050> reason<00:01:38.230> why

00:01:38.310 --> 00:01:38.320 
successful time and it don't reason why

00:01:38.320 --> 00:01:39.899 
successful time and it don't reason why

shouldn't have used my vision of
confluence<00:03:25.810> I<00:03:26.080> should<00:03:26.230> have<00:03:26.319> switched<00:03:26.380> over

00:03:26.789 --> 00:03:26.799 
confluence I should have switched over

00:03:26.799 --> 00:03:28.320 
confluence I should have switched over
it's<00:03:27.160> like<00:03:27.280> my<00:03:27.430> serosa<00:03:27.790> something<00:03:28.090> like<00:03:28.180> that

00:03:28.320 --> 00:03:28.330 
it's like my serosa something like that

00:03:28.330 --> 00:03:30.150 
it's like my serosa something like that
but<00:03:28.600> I<00:03:28.840> just<00:03:29.230> I<00:03:29.380> did<00:03:29.650> not<00:03:29.769> want<00:03:29.890> to<00:03:29.920> take<00:03:30.040> the

00:03:30.150 --> 00:03:30.160 
but I just I did not want to take the

00:03:30.160 --> 00:03:31.860 
but I just I did not want to take the
time<00:03:30.190> to<00:03:30.459> switch<00:03:30.610> weapons<00:03:30.790> real<00:03:31.120> quick<00:03:31.330> the

00:03:31.860 --> 00:03:31.870 
time to switch weapons real quick the

00:03:31.870 --> 00:03:33.509 
time to switch weapons real quick the
Wizards<00:03:32.200> will<00:03:32.350> eventually<00:03:33.160> come<00:03:33.280> out<00:03:33.370> the

00:03:33.509 --> 00:03:33.519 
Wizards will eventually come out the

00:03:35.610 --> 00:03:35.620 
ogres we didn't even let them get to a

00:03:35.620 --> 00:03:36.720 
ogres we didn't even let them get to a

00:03:53.400 --> 00:03:53.410 
getting into so this is where the rocket

00:03:53.410 --> 00:03:54.270 
getting into so this is where the rocket
launchers<00:03:53.739> are<00:03:53.829> going<00:03:53.950> to<00:03:54.010> come<00:03:54.130> in<00:03:54.250> handy

00:03:54.270 --> 00:03:54.280 
launchers are going to come in handy

00:03:54.280 --> 00:03:56.280 
launchers are going to come in handy
because<00:03:54.519> since<00:03:55.390> the<00:03:55.450> ogres<00:03:55.840> we<00:03:56.079> didn't<00:03:56.230> even

00:03:56.280 --> 00:03:56.290 
because since the ogres we didn't even

00:03:56.290 --> 00:03:57.449 
because since the ogres we didn't even
give<00:03:56.560> him<00:03:56.590> a<00:03:56.680> chance<00:03:56.709> to<00:03:56.980> get<00:03:57.160> to<00:03:57.250> the<00:03:57.340> middle

00:03:57.449 --> 00:03:57.459 
give him a chance to get to the middle

00:03:57.459 --> 00:03:59.039 
give him a chance to get to the middle
and<00:03:57.670> I<00:03:57.820> you<00:03:58.090> know<00:03:58.180> again<00:03:58.420> I<00:03:58.570> don't<00:03:58.720> think<00:03:58.930> they

00:03:59.039 --> 00:03:59.049 
and I you know again I don't think they

00:03:59.049 --> 00:04:00.360 
and I you know again I don't think they
actually<00:03:59.079> will<00:03:59.470> come<00:03:59.650> to<00:03:59.769> the<00:03:59.829> middle<00:03:59.950> I<00:04:00.190> think

00:04:00.360 --> 00:04:00.370 
actually will come to the middle I think

00:04:00.370 --> 00:04:02.490 
actually will come to the middle I think
they<00:04:00.430> just<00:04:00.459> stay<00:04:00.790> to<00:04:00.850> the<00:04:01.000> sides<00:04:01.239> I<00:04:01.450> just<00:04:02.109> start

00:04:02.490 --> 00:04:02.500 
they just stay to the sides I just start

00:04:02.500 --> 00:04:04.470 
they just stay to the sides I just start
appearing<00:04:02.890> out<00:04:03.130> and<00:04:03.370> just<00:04:03.700> start<00:04:04.180> launching

00:04:18.609 --> 00:04:20.310 
kept popping out and then just firing a
few<00:04:18.760> rockets<00:04:19.090> and<00:04:19.269> coming<00:04:19.510> back<00:04:19.600> up<00:04:19.810> we're

00:04:20.310 --> 00:04:20.320 
few rockets and coming back up we're

00:04:20.320 --> 00:04:21.719 
few rockets and coming back up we're
getting<00:04:20.440> my<00:04:20.650> health<00:04:20.859> just<00:04:21.310> taking<00:04:21.519> out<00:04:21.609> some

thralls reloading rinse and repeat and

00:04:23.919 --> 00:04:24.960 
thralls reloading rinse and repeat and
just<00:04:24.070> keep<00:04:24.160> doing<00:04:24.340> it<00:04:24.400> and<00:04:24.460> eventually<00:04:24.610> both

00:04:24.960 --> 00:04:24.970 
just keep doing it and eventually both

00:04:24.970 --> 00:04:26.640 
just keep doing it and eventually both
ogres<00:04:25.300> went<00:04:25.389> down<00:04:25.660> and<00:04:25.990> we<00:04:26.200> were<00:04:26.320> good<00:04:26.470> to<00:04:26.620> go

that's<00:05:27.080> probably<00:05:27.380> just<00:05:27.500> want<00:05:27.710> to<00:05:27.770> pvp

00:05:27.879 --> 00:05:27.889 
that's probably just want to pvp

00:05:27.889 --> 00:05:29.500 
that's probably just want to pvp
perspective<00:05:28.580> but<00:05:28.729> looks<00:05:29.060> like<00:05:29.180> it's<00:05:29.300> got<00:05:29.389> the

00:05:29.500 --> 00:05:29.510 
perspective but looks like it's got the

00:05:29.510 --> 00:05:31.060 
perspective but looks like it's got the
same<00:05:29.630> profile<00:05:30.020> as<00:05:30.050> like<00:05:30.410> the<00:05:30.590> up<00:05:30.710> for<00:05:30.860> anything

00:05:31.060 --> 00:05:31.070 
same profile as like the up for anything

00:05:31.070 --> 00:05:32.800 
same profile as like the up for anything
so<00:05:31.490> and<00:05:31.760> I<00:05:32.000> think<00:05:32.030> it's<00:05:32.300> got<00:05:32.479> one<00:05:32.660> of<00:05:32.750> the

00:05:32.800 --> 00:05:32.810 
so and I think it's got one of the

00:05:32.810 --> 00:05:34.150 
so and I think it's got one of the
modifiers<00:05:33.169> where<00:05:33.380> if<00:05:33.440> you<00:05:33.500> aim<00:05:33.620> down<00:05:33.650> sight<00:05:34.010> of

00:05:34.150 --> 00:05:34.160 
modifiers where if you aim down sight of

00:05:34.160 --> 00:05:35.860 
modifiers where if you aim down sight of
fire<00:05:34.310> slow<00:05:34.580> it<00:05:34.700> more<00:05:34.850> damage<00:05:35.180> so<00:05:35.330> def<00:05:35.750> you're

00:05:35.860 --> 00:05:35.870 
fire slow it more damage so def you're

00:05:35.870 --> 00:05:37.420 
fire slow it more damage so def you're
looking<00:05:36.080> forward<00:05:36.290> to<00:05:36.440> the<00:05:36.680> two<00:05:37.100> loving<00:05:37.310> that

00:05:37.420 --> 00:05:37.430 
looking forward to the two loving that

00:05:37.430 --> 00:05:38.860
