 in addition, dancing is very tasty 

00:03:40.389 --> 00:03:44.599
 Even though there had been sometime, experience shows that even though I say good 

00:03:44.599 --> 00:03:47.059
 but these are as excellent as each other yes 

00:03:47.059 --> 00:03:50.289

00:04:12.159 --> 00:04:15.649
 that caused by the drought but the doctors from the research from the city 

00:04:15.649 --> 00:04:17.669
 hence the ears eyes
