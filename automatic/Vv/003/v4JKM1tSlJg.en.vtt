00:00:36.630 --> 00:00:39.319 
clean you know my skin clearly looked
clean<00:00:36.989> as<00:00:37.230> soon<00:00:37.500> as<00:00:37.649> I<00:00:37.680> washed<00:00:38.070> it<00:00:38.309> but<00:00:38.489> there

00:00:39.319 --> 00:00:39.329 
clean as soon as I washed it but there

00:00:39.329 --> 00:00:41.270 
clean as soon as I washed it but there
were<00:00:39.420> some<00:00:39.600> few<00:00:39.989> white<00:00:40.230> patches<00:00:40.559> that<00:00:40.920> came<00:00:41.129> on

were some few white patches that came on

00:00:41.280 --> 00:00:44.000 
were some few white patches that came on
to<00:00:41.460> my<00:00:41.610> skin<00:00:41.670> immediately<00:00:42.239> after<00:00:43.050> I<00:00:43.079> dried<00:00:43.800> up

00:00:44.000 --> 00:00:44.010

to my skin immediately after I dried up
so<00:00:44.789> that's<00:00:45.090> when<00:00:45.300> I<00:00:45.329> thought<00:00:45.570> maybe<00:00:45.809> that's

00:00:46.160 --> 00:00:46.170 
so that's when I thought maybe that's

00:00:46.170 --> 00:00:50.090 
so that's when I thought maybe that's
why<00:00:46.350> the<00:00:46.410> cream<00:00:46.770> with<00:00:47.100> the<00:00:47.370> wash<00:00:47.640> so<00:00:48.570> I<00:00:49.410> did<00:00:49.920> use

00:00:50.090 --> 00:00:50.100 
why the cream with the wash so I did use

00:00:50.100 --> 00:00:53.150 
why the cream with the wash so I did use
the<00:00:50.129> cream<00:00:50.850> afterwards<00:00:51.629> but<00:00:52.500> it<00:00:52.710> did<00:00:52.920> no<00:00:53.129> good

00:00:53.150 --> 00:00:53.160 
the cream afterwards but it did no good

00:00:53.160 --> 00:00:55.790 
the cream afterwards but it did no good
you<00:00:53.969> know<00:00:54.120> it's<00:00:54.570> just<00:00:54.899> the<00:00:55.170> same<00:00:55.410> product
