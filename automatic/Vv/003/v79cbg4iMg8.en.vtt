00:02:20.210 --> 00:02:20.220 

00:02:20.220 --> 00:02:30.410 

so

00:02:30.410 --> 00:02:30.420 

00:02:30.420 --> 00:02:40.260 

you

00:02:40.260 --> 00:02:40.270 

00:02:40.270 --> 00:02:44.770 

so<00:02:41.270> from<00:02:41.510> the<00:02:41.660> sea<00:02:41.900> at<00:02:42.020> 9:00<00:02:43.420> we<00:02:44.420> take<00:02:44.630> our

00:02:44.770 --> 00:02:44.780 
so from the sea at 9:00 we take our

00:02:44.780 --> 00:02:47.050 
so from the sea at 9:00 we take our
index<00:02:45.140> finger<00:02:45.320> and<00:02:45.530> we<00:02:45.680> move<00:02:46.610> it<00:02:46.760> to<00:02:46.880> the

00:02:47.050 --> 00:02:47.060 
index finger and we move it to the

00:02:47.060 --> 00:02:50.130 
index finger and we move it to the
second<00:02:47.780> fret<00:02:48.020> of<00:02:48.140> the<00:02:48.170> a<00:02:48.260> string<00:02:48.350> and<00:02:48.860> we<00:02:49.250> play

00:02:50.130 --> 00:02:50.140 
second fret of the a string and we play

00:02:50.140 --> 00:02:52.600 
second fret of the a string and we play
basically<00:02:51.140> like<00:02:51.230> a<00:02:51.260> G<00:02:51.560> chord<00:02:51.590> but<00:02:52.100> with<00:02:52.280> this

00:02:52.600 --> 00:02:52.610 
basically like a G chord but with this

00:02:52.610 --> 00:02:55.630 
basically like a G chord but with this
note<00:02:52.880> it's<00:02:53.180> the<00:02:53.750> first<00:02:54.050> note

00:02:55.630 --> 00:02:55.640 
note it's the first note

00:02:55.640 --> 00:03:04.030 
note it's the first note
and<00:02:55.940> no<00:02:56.860> low<00:02:57.860> e-string<00:02:58.430> so<00:02:59.420> it's<00:02:59.570> like

00:03:04.030 --> 00:03:04.040 

00:03:04.040 --> 00:03:10.400 

and<00:03:05.270> then<00:03:06.270> the<00:03:06.390> final<00:03:06.660> note<00:03:08.989> is<00:03:09.989> a<00:03:10.050> G<00:03:10.379> chord

00:03:10.400 --> 00:03:10.410 
and then the final note is a G chord

00:03:10.410 --> 00:03:23.140 
and then the final note is a G chord
before<00:03:11.340> it<00:03:11.610> starts<00:03:11.879> over<00:03:12.000> so<00:03:12.209> it's<00:03:12.330> like

00:03:23.140 --> 00:03:23.150 

00:03:23.150 --> 00:03:36.250 

you

00:03:36.250 --> 00:03:36.260 

00:03:36.260 --> 00:03:43.309 

you

00:03:43.309 --> 00:03:43.319 

00:03:43.319 --> 00:03:47.090 

you

00:03:47.090 --> 00:03:47.100 

00:03:47.100 --> 00:03:50.510 

you

00:03:50.510 --> 00:03:50.520 

00:03:50.520 --> 00:03:53.820 

now<00:03:51.520> uh<00:03:51.630> Kenny<00:03:52.630> waiting<00:03:52.960> to<00:03:53.050> actually<00:03:53.290> drop<00:03:53.590> D

00:03:53.820 --> 00:03:53.830 
now uh Kenny waiting to actually drop D

00:03:53.830 --> 00:03:55.530 
now uh Kenny waiting to actually drop D
on<00:03:54.010> his<00:03:54.160> strat<00:03:54.490> I<00:03:54.760> saw<00:03:55.000> when<00:03:55.180> he<00:03:55.240> was<00:03:55.360> playing

00:03:55.530 --> 00:03:55.540 
on his strat I saw when he was playing

00:03:55.540 --> 00:03:57.420 
on his strat I saw when he was playing
live<00:03:55.810> but<00:03:56.500> he's<00:03:56.620> still<00:03:56.800> pretty<00:03:56.830> much<00:03:57.220> playing

00:03:57.420 --> 00:03:57.430 
live but he's still pretty much playing

00:03:57.430 --> 00:03:59.310 
live but he's still pretty much playing
the<00:03:57.670> same<00:03:57.820> way<00:03:57.970> just<00:03:58.270> like<00:03:58.480> you<00:03:58.660> see<00:03:58.810> him<00:03:58.930> slide

00:03:59.310 --> 00:03:59.320 
the same way just like you see him slide

00:03:59.320 --> 00:04:01.830 
the same way just like you see him slide
up<00:03:59.590> and<00:03:59.880> that's<00:04:00.880> to<00:04:01.060> play<00:04:01.210> that<00:04:01.390> G<00:04:01.630> note

00:04:01.830 --> 00:04:01.840 
up and that's to play that G note

00:04:01.840 --> 00:04:04.200 
up and that's to play that G note
because<00:04:02.050> he's<00:04:02.230> tuned<00:04:02.920> in<00:04:03.070> drop<00:04:03.310> D<00:04:03.340> so<00:04:03.820> he<00:04:04.090> has

00:04:04.200 --> 00:04:04.210 
because he's tuned in drop D so he has

00:04:04.210 --> 00:04:05.730 
because he's tuned in drop D so he has
to<00:04:04.300> be<00:04:04.420> a<00:04:04.450> whole<00:04:04.660> step<00:04:04.780> higher<00:04:05.050> to<00:04:05.260> hit<00:04:05.410> the<00:04:05.560> G

00:04:05.730 --> 00:04:05.740 
to be a whole step higher to hit the G

00:04:05.740 --> 00:04:07.650 
to be a whole step higher to hit the G
so<00:04:05.920> if<00:04:06.010> you<00:04:06.100> see<00:04:06.280> him<00:04:06.340> doing<00:04:06.520> that<00:04:06.790> that's<00:04:07.480> what

00:04:07.650 --> 00:04:07.660 
so if you see him doing that that's what

00:04:07.660 --> 00:04:10.980

00:05:19.969 --> 00:05:25.889 

and<00:05:20.569> the<00:05:20.779> base<00:05:21.019> is<00:05:21.499> going<00:05:21.769> you<00:05:22.219> know<00:05:22.249> and
