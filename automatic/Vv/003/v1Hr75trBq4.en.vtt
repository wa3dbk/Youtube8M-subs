only two made by Sandoval and he made a

00:00:18.980 --> 00:00:21.909 
only two made by Sandoval and he made a

nice design but his design was a little
bit<00:00:22.070> too<00:00:22.369> over<00:00:22.730> complicated<00:00:23.390> so<00:00:23.960> what<00:00:24.320> side<00:00:24.590> to

00:00:24.819 --> 00:00:24.829 
bit too over complicated so what side to

00:00:24.829 --> 00:00:28.089 
bit too over complicated so what side to
make<00:00:25.699> it<00:00:25.939> simpler<00:00:26.360> and<00:00:26.540> yeah<00:00:27.349> it<00:00:27.649> turned<00:00:27.980> out

00:00:28.089 --> 00:00:28.099 
make it simpler and yeah it turned out

00:00:28.099 --> 00:00:30.970

it won't have slots to pick era so it

00:01:20.030 --> 00:01:23.260 
it won't have slots to pick era so it
won't<00:01:20.420> be<00:01:20.630> its<00:01:20.990> own<00:01:21.200> it<00:01:21.770> will<00:01:22.130> only<00:01:22.310> pick<00:01:22.759> up<00:01:22.939> if

00:01:23.260 --> 00:01:23.270

00:01:23.270 --> 00:01:26.620 
won't be its own it will only pick up if
we<00:01:23.600> chose<00:01:23.959> the<00:01:24.200> right<00:01:24.380> title<00:01:24.880> now<00:01:25.880> when<00:01:26.359> we

00:01:26.620 --> 00:01:26.630 
we chose the right title now when we

00:01:26.630 --> 00:01:29.859 
we chose the right title now when we
throw<00:01:27.020> the<00:01:27.319> item<00:01:27.679> it's<00:01:28.279> you<00:01:28.700> put<00:01:29.149> one<00:01:29.329> marking

throw the item it's you put one marking
and<00:01:30.109> that<00:01:30.139> will<00:01:30.649> be<00:01:31.130> adult<00:01:31.700> enough<00:01:31.850> to<00:01:32.029> power

00:01:32.800 --> 00:01:32.810 
and that will be adult enough to power

00:01:32.810 --> 00:01:35.559 
and that will be adult enough to power
the<00:01:33.079> second<00:01:33.469> read<00:01:33.770> some<00:01:33.799> dust<00:01:34.249> and<00:01:34.609> it<00:01:35.270> will

00:01:35.559 --> 00:01:35.569 
the second read some dust and it will

00:01:35.569 --> 00:01:37.840 
the second read some dust and it will
power<00:01:35.810> this<00:01:36.109> drop<00:01:36.380> so<00:01:36.799> the<00:01:37.100> i<00:01:37.130> think<00:01:37.429> that<00:01:37.609> is

00:01:37.840 --> 00:01:37.850 
power this drop so the i think that is

00:01:37.850 --> 00:01:41.469 
power this drop so the i think that is
here<00:01:38.179> we'll<00:01:38.659> go<00:01:38.869> to<00:01:38.929> this<00:01:39.499> hopper<00:01:40.069> and<00:01:40.700> it<00:01:41.240> will

00:01:41.469 --> 00:01:41.479 
here we'll go to this hopper and it will

00:01:41.479 --> 00:01:43.660 
here we'll go to this hopper and it will
empower<00:01:41.929> these<00:01:42.259> converter<00:01:42.829> for<00:01:43.159> own<00:01:43.429> while

00:01:43.660 --> 00:01:43.670 
empower these converter for own while

00:01:43.670 --> 00:01:47.620 
empower these converter for own while
and<00:01:44.319> when<00:01:45.319> is<00:01:45.529> empowered<00:01:46.189> it<00:01:46.520> will<00:01:46.849> unlock<00:01:47.240> it

00:01:47.620 --> 00:01:47.630 
and when is empowered it will unlock it

00:01:47.630 --> 00:01:50.230 
and when is empowered it will unlock it
so<00:01:47.899> the<00:01:48.229> item<00:01:48.649> that<00:01:48.679> is<00:01:49.039> you<00:01:49.340> can<00:01:49.579> go<00:01:49.789> to<00:01:49.849> this

00:01:50.230 --> 00:01:50.240 
so the item that is you can go to this

00:01:50.240 --> 00:01:53.109 
so the item that is you can go to this
drop<00:01:50.569> and<00:01:51.289> it<00:01:51.619> will<00:01:51.859> pick<00:01:52.069> another<00:01:52.429> item<00:01:52.700> from

00:01:53.109 --> 00:01:53.119 
drop and it will pick another item from

00:01:53.119 --> 00:01:58.089 
drop and it will pick another item from
the<00:01:53.179> smart<00:01:53.869> car<00:01:54.049> topper<00:01:54.319> that<00:01:55.270> i<00:01:56.270> came<00:01:57.099> that
