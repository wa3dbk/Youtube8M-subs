00:01:11.420 --> 00:01:11.430 
never know that it ever broke but what I

00:01:11.430 --> 00:01:15.789 
never know that it ever broke but what I
like<00:01:11.640> to<00:01:11.760> do<00:01:11.909> here<00:01:12.270> I<00:01:12.420> get<00:01:12.750> some<00:01:12.930> tie<00:01:13.140> straps

00:01:15.789 --> 00:01:15.799 

00:01:15.799 --> 00:01:20.020 

and<00:01:16.799> made<00:01:16.979> out<00:01:17.130> of<00:01:17.250> plastic<00:01:17.790> they<00:01:18.210> won't<00:01:18.390> stick

00:01:20.020 --> 00:01:20.030 
and made out of plastic they won't stick

00:01:20.030 --> 00:01:22.780 
and made out of plastic they won't stick
and<00:01:21.030> what<00:01:21.210> I'll<00:01:21.330> do<00:01:21.479> is<00:01:21.509> just<00:01:21.840> tighten<00:01:22.020> it<00:01:22.200> up

00:01:22.780 --> 00:01:22.790 
and what I'll do is just tighten it up

00:01:22.790 --> 00:01:24.830 
and what I'll do is just tighten it up
the<00:01:23.790> easiest<00:01:23.970> way<00:01:24.180> to<00:01:24.210> do<00:01:24.360> it<00:01:24.450> because<00:01:24.570> the

00:01:24.830 --> 00:01:24.840 
the easiest way to do it because the

00:01:24.840 --> 00:01:29.499 
the easiest way to do it because the
clamps<00:01:25.200> not<00:01:25.350> going<00:01:25.560> to<00:01:25.619> hold<00:01:25.799> it<00:01:25.920> that<00:01:25.950> angle

00:01:29.499 --> 00:01:29.509 

00:01:29.509 --> 00:01:33.430 

just<00:01:30.509> like<00:01:30.689> that

00:01:33.430 --> 00:01:33.440 

00:01:33.440 --> 00:01:38.030 

but<00:01:34.440> as<00:01:34.530> many<00:01:34.800> own<00:01:34.979> as<00:01:35.250> I<00:01:35.340> want<00:01:35.610> to<00:01:36.890> more<00:01:37.890> the

00:01:38.030 --> 00:01:38.040 
but as many own as I want to more the

00:01:38.040 --> 00:01:45.050 
but as many own as I want to more the
better

00:01:45.050 --> 00:01:45.060 

00:01:45.060 --> 00:01:48.469 

see<00:01:46.049> the<00:01:46.170> glue<00:01:46.380> squeezing<00:01:46.860> out<00:01:47.159> of<00:01:47.190> it<00:01:47.549> you

00:01:48.469 --> 00:01:48.479 
see the glue squeezing out of it you

00:01:48.479 --> 00:01:50.810 
see the glue squeezing out of it you
know<00:01:48.630> that<00:01:48.810> is<00:01:48.930> holding<00:01:49.340> it's<00:01:50.340> staying<00:01:50.670> in

00:01:50.810 --> 00:01:50.820 
know that is holding it's staying in

00:01:50.820 --> 00:01:54.770 
know that is holding it's staying in
place<00:01:51.440> the<00:01:52.440> brake<00:01:52.710> is<00:01:52.890> clean<00:01:53.310> and<00:01:53.549> snug<00:01:54.119> I'm
