00:00:31.310 --> 00:00:31.320 
get that edge guard and I think this

00:00:31.320 --> 00:00:32.600 
get that edge guard and I think this
time<00:00:31.380> robotic<00:00:31.830> mission<00:00:32.070> happen<00:00:32.250> to<00:00:32.309> fall<00:00:32.399> for

know it holds onto the edge want to see
a<00:00:51.510> wedge<00:00:51.719> hop<00:00:51.899> up<00:00:52.079> here<00:00:52.170> out<00:00:52.230> of<00:00:52.379> that<00:00:52.559> upper

00:00:53.229 --> 00:00:53.239 
a wedge hop up here out of that upper

apiece fo a percent lead not that that

00:01:02.039 --> 00:01:03.560 
apiece fo a percent lead not that that
matters<00:01:02.190> as<00:01:02.460> much<00:01:02.489> in<00:01:03.059> the<00:01:03.149> ice<00:01:03.270> climber

00:01:03.560 --> 00:01:03.570 
matters as much in the ice climber

00:01:03.570 --> 00:01:04.910 
matters as much in the ice climber
matchup<00:01:04.019> especially<00:01:04.439> when<00:01:04.530> I<00:01:04.619> grabbed<00:01:04.769> his

00:01:04.910 --> 00:01:04.920 
matchup especially when I grabbed his

00:01:04.920 --> 00:01:07.280 
matchup especially when I grabbed his
death<00:01:05.189> but<00:01:05.850> I<00:01:06.090> mean<00:01:06.479> a<00:01:06.510> straight<00:01:06.869> down<00:01:07.020> smash

00:01:07.280 --> 00:01:07.290 
death but I mean a straight down smash

00:01:07.290 --> 00:01:09.230 
death but I mean a straight down smash
is<00:01:07.650> not<00:01:07.740> quite<00:01:08.220> gonna<00:01:08.430> kill<00:01:08.610> this<00:01:08.760> percent<00:01:09.119> but

00:01:09.230 --> 00:01:09.240 
is not quite gonna kill this percent but

00:01:09.240 --> 00:01:10.609 
is not quite gonna kill this percent but
followed<00:01:09.600> up<00:01:09.720> with<00:01:09.750> like<00:01:09.930> a<00:01:09.960> Ledge<00:01:10.170> hog<00:01:10.380> or

00:01:10.609 --> 00:01:10.619 
followed up with like a Ledge hog or

00:01:10.619 --> 00:01:12.679 
followed up with like a Ledge hog or
anything<00:01:11.250> like<00:01:11.280> that<00:01:11.400> it<00:01:11.729> will<00:01:11.880> and<00:01:12.510> the<00:01:12.570> other

earlier keeper keeper is really fishing
for<00:01:15.360> this<00:01:15.450> crap<00:01:15.630> and<00:01:15.869> through<00:01:16.530> all<00:01:16.560> of<00:01:16.680> that

00:01:16.760 --> 00:01:16.770 
for this crap and through all of that

00:01:16.770 --> 00:01:18.170 
for this crap and through all of that
robotic<00:01:17.220> fish<00:01:17.280> is<00:01:17.400> able<00:01:17.640> to<00:01:17.700> bring<00:01:17.909> back<00:01:18.030> this

00:01:18.170 --> 00:01:18.180 
robotic fish is able to bring back this

00:01:18.180 --> 00:01:19.429 
robotic fish is able to bring back this
percent<00:01:18.570> if<00:01:18.869> he<00:01:18.960> can't<00:01:19.140> just<00:01:19.170> get<00:01:19.350> him

00:01:19.429 --> 00:01:19.439 
percent if he can't just get him

00:01:19.439 --> 00:01:21.950 
percent if he can't just get him
separated<00:01:19.920> he<00:01:20.460> doesn't<00:01:20.820> die<00:01:21.000> but<00:01:21.630> he<00:01:21.659> didn't

00:01:21.950 --> 00:01:21.960 
separated he doesn't die but he didn't

00:01:21.960 --> 00:01:23.359 
separated he doesn't die but he didn't
get<00:01:22.049> him<00:01:22.170> separated<00:01:22.680> and<00:01:22.799> there<00:01:23.100> goes<00:01:23.250> the

get him separated and there goes the

00:01:23.369 --> 00:01:25.249 
get him separated and there goes the
stock<00:01:23.580> so<00:01:23.850> Nirvana<00:01:24.330> actually<00:01:24.750> predicted<00:01:25.170> this

00:01:25.249 --> 00:01:25.259 
stock so Nirvana actually predicted this

00:04:38.210 --> 00:04:38.220 
laser control is like huge like oh

00:04:38.220 --> 00:04:40.530 
laser control is like huge like oh
really<00:04:39.220> really<00:04:39.460> quick<00:04:39.700> back<00:04:39.880> here<00:04:40.060> a<00:04:40.180> lot<00:04:40.450> of

00:04:40.530 --> 00:04:40.540

00:04:45.220 --> 00:04:46.260 
Falco's laser actually has if you're in
the<00:04:45.310> air<00:04:45.400> you<00:04:45.550> can<00:04:45.700> act<00:04:45.880> pretty<00:04:45.970> much

00:04:46.260 --> 00:04:46.270 
the air you can act pretty much

00:04:46.270 --> 00:04:48.330 
the air you can act pretty much
immediately<00:04:46.600> after<00:04:47.229> after<00:04:47.680> getting<00:04:47.890> it<00:04:48.010> which

00:04:48.330 --> 00:04:48.340 
immediately after after getting it which

00:04:48.340 --> 00:04:50.760 
immediately after after getting it which
is<00:04:48.460> why<00:04:48.550> ooh<00:04:48.810> Laser<00:04:49.810> F<00:04:50.110> smash<00:04:50.350> on<00:04:50.530> that<00:04:50.650> on<00:04:50.740> that

fishes pillar composting can be a little

00:05:17.540 --> 00:05:19.630 
fishes pillar composting can be a little
bit<00:05:17.660> better<00:05:17.780> than<00:05:18.020> yeah<00:05:18.140> a<00:05:18.290> little<00:05:18.740> more<00:05:18.890> on<00:05:18.980> so

kinky bernisa sort of wind neutral more
times<00:05:22.820> and<00:05:23.150> robotic<00:05:23.570> fish<00:05:23.720> has<00:05:23.930> to<00:05:24.110> and<00:05:24.560> that's

00:05:24.700 --> 00:05:24.710 
times and robotic fish has to and that's

00:05:24.710 --> 00:05:26.320 
times and robotic fish has to and that's
gonna<00:05:24.920> be<00:05:25.310> hard<00:05:25.520> because<00:05:25.730> of<00:05:25.910> course<00:05:26.120> it<00:05:26.240> too

00:05:26.320 --> 00:05:26.330 
gonna be hard because of course it too

yes what's the L button all right so now
robotic<00:06:18.150> fish<00:06:18.270> were<00:06:18.420> the<00:06:18.540> first<00:06:18.840> real<00:06:19.260> lead<00:06:19.590> of

00:06:19.790 --> 00:06:19.800 
robotic fish were the first real lead of

00:06:19.800 --> 00:06:24.080 
robotic fish were the first real lead of
this<00:06:19.890> match<00:06:20.160> I<00:06:20.370> would<00:06:20.400> say<00:06:20.670> right<00:06:20.850> now<00:06:23.090> who

this match I would say right now who
could<00:06:24.300> grab<00:06:24.540> but<00:06:24.900> doesn't<00:06:25.350> get<00:06:25.440> too<00:06:25.560> much<00:06:25.710> out

00:06:25.820 --> 00:06:25.830 
could grab but doesn't get too much out

00:06:25.830 --> 00:06:27.710 
could grab but doesn't get too much out
of<00:06:25.890> it<00:06:26.040> Paco<00:06:26.640> really<00:06:26.940> gets<00:06:27.090> less<00:06:27.270> out<00:06:27.420> of<00:06:27.450> grabs

didn't get a follow up off of it you

00:06:38.070 --> 00:06:39.230 
didn't get a follow up off of it you
probably<00:06:38.310> wanted<00:06:38.610> something<00:06:38.910> like<00:06:39.000> there

00:06:39.230 --> 00:06:39.240

00:06:57.080 --> 00:06:57.090 
fans hasn't I your robotic fish didn't

00:06:57.090 --> 00:06:58.700 
fans hasn't I your robotic fish didn't
even<00:06:57.270> have<00:06:57.390> to<00:06:57.510> like<00:06:57.660> predicted<00:06:58.170> it<00:06:58.320> was<00:06:58.530> so

robotic fish with that too low yeah that

00:07:03.600 --> 00:07:05.420 
robotic fish with that too low yeah that
the<00:07:03.780> aneta<00:07:04.110> the<00:07:04.440> presence<00:07:04.770> of<00:07:04.830> mind<00:07:04.890> to<00:07:05.190> shoot

00:07:05.420 --> 00:07:05.430

afterwards was really smart friend

00:07:07.920 --> 00:07:09.950 
afterwards was really smart friend
robotic<00:07:08.100> fish<00:07:08.340> to<00:07:08.790> secure<00:07:09.300> that<00:07:09.330> once<00:07:09.750> he<00:07:09.840> got

00:07:09.950 --> 00:07:09.960 
robotic fish to secure that once he got

00:07:09.960 --> 00:07:11.480 
robotic fish to secure that once he got
that<00:07:10.170> that<00:07:10.470> laser<00:07:10.680> yet<00:07:10.860> I<00:07:10.950> knew<00:07:11.070> the<00:07:11.190> match<00:07:11.310> was

00:07:11.480 --> 00:07:11.490 
that that laser yet I knew the match was

00:07:11.490 --> 00:07:15.860 
that that laser yet I knew the match was
over<00:07:12.380> guys<00:07:13.380> there's<00:07:14.160> all<00:07:14.400> what<00:07:14.670> what<00:07:15.240> the<00:07:15.480> why
