00:00:01.180 --> 00:00:06.310
 good on this occasion a lot to do the 

00:00:03.159 --> 00:00:09.670
 demo video in this case 

00:00:06.310 --> 00:00:11.850
 we are taking a flower printer to a 

00:00:09.670 --> 00:00:14.320
 model of this one 

00:00:11.850 --> 00:00:16.360
 j 125 

00:00:14.320 --> 00:00:19.090
 This type of printers are good 

00:00:16.360 --> 00:00:23.520
 teams have a pretty high speed 

00:00:19.090 --> 00:00:23.520
 acceptable however 

00:00:23.630 --> 00:00:27.679
 by the type of printing system that 

00:00:25.699 --> 00:00:30.060
 They do not recommend the use of 

00:00:27.679 --> 00:00:32.290
 ink systems 

00:00:30.060 --> 00:00:34.590
 after 

00:00:32.290 --> 00:00:37.980
 recommended the use of 

00:00:34.590 --> 00:00:40.650
 of high capacity ink cartridges 

00:00:37.980 --> 00:00:46.710
 respectable self that obviously 

00:00:40.650 --> 00:00:47.630
 you can recharge and good in this 

00:00:46.710 --> 00:00:50.950
 case 

00:00:47.630 --> 00:00:50.950
 as I already told you 

00:00:54.910 --> 00:00:58.890
 that the cartridges have been installed 

00:00:59.350 --> 00:01:02.010
 the honest ones 

00:01:02.060 --> 00:01:05.430
 it's part they can only find even in 

00:01:03.710 --> 00:01:08.210
 our store 

00:01:05.430 --> 00:01:08.210
 the printer 

00:01:08.740 --> 00:01:13.890
 out of the market 

00:01:10.890 --> 00:01:15.390
 in this printer factory but if you 

00:01:13.890 --> 00:01:17.159
 you have the introducer to the walls 

00:01:15.390 --> 00:01:21.649
 adapted 

00:01:17.159 --> 00:01:21.649
 Well with us and us 

00:01:23.420 --> 00:01:28.220
 we will give you the information regarding 

00:01:26.119 --> 00:01:31.630
 type of printing that can be done with 

00:01:28.220 --> 00:01:33.640
 these cartridges already costs 

00:01:31.630 --> 00:01:36.950
 in this case we are going to do the test of 

00:01:33.640 --> 00:01:39.829
 expression for more or less days 

00:01:36.950 --> 00:01:42.680
 the quality it has and the speed with 

00:01:39.829 --> 00:01:45.400
 corruptions people 

00:01:42.680 --> 00:01:45.400
 coma 

00:01:46.400 --> 00:01:50.270
 with much here 

00:01:48.230 --> 00:01:51.650
 let's bring first a copy of the 

00:01:50.270 --> 00:01:54.940
 black 

00:01:51.650 --> 00:01:54.940
 will already copying 

00:02:25.080 --> 00:02:28.620
 as we can see is a good 

00:02:26.880 --> 00:02:31.640
 black and white print now I do not 

00:02:28.620 --> 00:02:31.640
 it was in color 

00:03:26.840 --> 00:03:34.599
 in the same way we can see that 

00:03:30.019 --> 00:03:34.599
 Bona print quality aloud 

00:03:37.080 --> 00:03:41.570
 this is why the original 

00:03:39.380 --> 00:03:44.890
 despite this it is a copy because no 

00:03:41.570 --> 00:03:44.890
 let's forget it 's a copy 

00:03:46.010 --> 00:03:49.030

00:03:49.520 --> 00:03:55.810
 and a lot
