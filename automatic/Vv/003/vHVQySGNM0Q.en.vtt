00:01:01.010 --> 00:01:01.020 
the only reason why haven't done them is

00:01:01.020 --> 00:01:02.569 
the only reason why haven't done them is
because<00:01:01.469> it's<00:01:01.649> some<00:01:01.829> cards<00:01:02.129> that<00:01:02.280> you<00:01:02.340> need<00:01:02.489> to

00:01:02.569 --> 00:01:02.579 
because it's some cards that you need to

00:01:02.579 --> 00:01:03.500 
because it's some cards that you need to
do<00:01:02.730> these<00:01:02.879> that<00:01:03.030> are<00:01:03.120> actually<00:01:03.390> pretty

00:01:03.500 --> 00:01:03.510 
do these that are actually pretty

00:01:03.510 --> 00:01:05.240 
do these that are actually pretty
expensive<00:01:03.899> but<00:01:04.080> if<00:01:04.320> you<00:01:04.439> do<00:01:04.589> them<00:01:04.680> guess<00:01:04.830> what

00:01:05.240 --> 00:01:05.250 
expensive but if you do them guess what

00:01:05.250 --> 00:01:07.039 
expensive but if you do them guess what
you<00:01:05.519> know<00:01:05.760> what's<00:01:05.970> expensive<00:01:06.330> so<00:01:06.570> for<00:01:06.720> example

00:01:07.039 --> 00:01:07.049
