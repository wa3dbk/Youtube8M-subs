00:00:08.810 --> 00:00:08.820 
possibility that we will have to

00:00:08.820 --> 00:00:10.459 
possibility that we will have to
postpone<00:00:09.059> that<00:00:09.360> series<00:00:09.750> until<00:00:10.080> a<00:00:10.139> team<00:00:10.349> of

season is actually release because I

00:00:12.150 --> 00:00:14.419

think<00:00:12.330> EA<00:00:12.540> from<00:00:13.080> what<00:00:13.620> the<00:00:13.740> article<00:00:14.070> has<00:00:14.250> said

00:00:14.419 --> 00:00:14.429 
think EA from what the article has said

00:00:14.429 --> 00:00:16.609 
think EA from what the article has said
it<00:00:14.639> could<00:00:14.820> be<00:00:15.000> maybe<00:00:15.299> two<00:00:15.570> to<00:00:15.809> three<00:00:16.080> weeks<00:00:16.109> and

00:00:16.609 --> 00:00:16.619 
it could be maybe two to three weeks and

00:00:16.619 --> 00:00:19.220 
it could be maybe two to three weeks and
at<00:00:17.190> the<00:00:17.369> stage<00:00:17.580> we<00:00:17.820> are<00:00:17.940> at<00:00:18.119> now<00:00:18.330> we<00:00:18.869> kind<00:00:19.140> of

00:00:19.220 --> 00:00:19.230 
at the stage we are at now we kind of

00:00:19.230 --> 00:00:20.660 
at the stage we are at now we kind of
need<00:00:19.380> the<00:00:19.500> team<00:00:19.680> of<00:00:19.800> the<00:00:19.859> seasons<00:00:20.189> to<00:00:20.340> release

finished I know if you people all know
don't<00:00:28.529> pause<00:00:28.710> it<00:00:28.890> because<00:00:29.070> you<00:00:29.130> won't<00:00:29.279> finish

00:00:29.359 --> 00:00:29.369

00:00:31.460 --> 00:00:31.470 
it 100% it will be finished because I am

00:00:31.470 --> 00:00:33.020 
it 100% it will be finished because I am
actually<00:00:31.650> enjoying<00:00:31.980> that<00:00:32.460> but<00:00:32.850> in<00:00:32.910> the

00:00:33.020 --> 00:00:33.030 
actually enjoying that but in the

00:00:33.030 --> 00:00:35.360 
actually enjoying that but in the
meantime<00:00:33.210> I<00:00:33.719> thought<00:00:34.020> of<00:00:34.320> sort<00:00:34.620> of<00:00:34.710> a<00:00:34.829> filling

00:00:35.360 --> 00:00:35.370 
meantime I thought of sort of a filling

00:00:35.370 --> 00:00:37.400 
meantime I thought of sort of a filling
series<00:00:35.790> that<00:00:36.059> can<00:00:36.300> sort<00:00:36.540> of<00:00:36.660> come<00:00:36.870> inside<00:00:36.899> with

00:00:37.400 --> 00:00:37.410 
series that can sort of come inside with

00:00:37.410 --> 00:00:39.260 
series that can sort of come inside with
it<00:00:37.559> once<00:00:37.739> that<00:00:37.920> actually<00:00:38.219> does<00:00:38.399> come<00:00:38.670> back<00:00:38.700> so

00:00:39.260 --> 00:00:39.270 
it once that actually does come back so

00:00:39.270 --> 00:00:41.270 
it once that actually does come back so
here<00:00:39.570> is<00:00:39.690> my<00:00:39.870> idea<00:00:40.260> so<00:00:40.500> the<00:00:40.590> idea<00:00:40.739> that<00:00:40.980> I<00:00:41.100> did

00:00:41.270 --> 00:00:41.280 
here is my idea so the idea that I did

00:00:41.280 --> 00:00:43.520 
here is my idea so the idea that I did
have<00:00:41.489> is<00:00:41.760> that<00:00:42.059> every<00:00:42.360> game<00:00:42.540> that<00:00:42.719> goes<00:00:42.840> by<00:00:43.140> we

00:00:43.520 --> 00:00:43.530 
have is that every game that goes by we

00:00:43.530 --> 00:00:45.650 
have is that every game that goes by we
not<00:00:43.890> only<00:00:43.920> play<00:00:44.370> for<00:00:44.430> a<00:00:44.640> coin<00:00:44.969> amount<00:00:45.329> but<00:00:45.570> we

00:00:45.650 --> 00:00:45.660 
not only play for a coin amount but we

00:00:45.660 --> 00:00:48.410 
not only play for a coin amount but we
also<00:00:45.930> play<00:00:46.410> for<00:00:46.739> a<00:00:46.770> pack<00:00:47.219> amount<00:00:47.610> so<00:00:47.910> say<00:00:48.390> for

00:00:48.410 --> 00:00:48.420 
also play for a pack amount so say for

00:00:48.420 --> 00:00:51.110 
also play for a pack amount so say for
example<00:00:48.660> we<00:00:49.379> score<00:00:49.680> two<00:00:49.920> goals<00:00:50.160> that's<00:00:50.820> two

00:00:51.110 --> 00:00:51.120 
example we score two goals that's two

00:00:51.120 --> 00:00:53.180 
example we score two goals that's two
packs<00:00:51.420> added<00:00:51.899> to<00:00:52.260> what<00:00:52.440> we<00:00:52.559> can<00:00:52.710> actually<00:00:52.980> open

00:00:53.180 --> 00:00:53.190 
packs added to what we can actually open

00:00:53.190 --> 00:00:55.549 
packs added to what we can actually open
after<00:00:53.670> the<00:00:54.120> game<00:00:54.329> and<00:00:54.539> say<00:00:55.050> we<00:00:55.260> score<00:00:55.530> a

00:00:55.549 --> 00:00:55.559 
after the game and say we score a

after the game and say we score a
hat-trick<00:00:55.829> or<00:00:56.370> we<00:00:56.789> keep<00:00:56.940> it<00:00:57.090> clean<00:00:57.300> see<00:00:57.570> then

and see what kind of like squads week

00:01:31.020 --> 00:01:33.859 
and see what kind of like squads week
raised<00:01:31.259> so<00:01:31.560> every<00:01:32.340> single<00:01:32.880> episode<00:01:33.150> is<00:01:33.720> going

00:01:33.859 --> 00:01:33.869 
raised so every single episode is going

00:01:33.869 --> 00:01:35.060 
raised so every single episode is going
to<00:01:33.960> be<00:01:34.049> different<00:01:34.259> that's<00:01:34.619> one<00:01:34.710> thing<00:01:35.009> that

00:01:35.060 --> 00:01:35.070 
to be different that's one thing that

00:01:35.070 --> 00:01:36.830 
to be different that's one thing that
happened<00:01:35.310> with<00:01:35.549> back<00:01:35.759> to<00:01:35.939> power<00:01:36.119> it<00:01:36.390> sort<00:01:36.780> of

00:01:36.830 --> 00:01:36.840 
happened with back to power it sort of

00:01:36.840 --> 00:01:38.510 
happened with back to power it sort of
became<00:01:37.200> stale<00:01:37.530> because<00:01:37.829> we<00:01:38.040> were<00:01:38.159> using<00:01:38.369> the

00:01:38.510 --> 00:01:38.520 
became stale because we were using the

00:01:38.520 --> 00:01:40.429 
became stale because we were using the
same<00:01:38.700> team<00:01:38.939> over<00:01:39.299> and<00:01:39.420> over<00:01:39.450> again<00:01:39.659> but<00:01:40.259> with

00:01:40.429 --> 00:01:40.439 
same team over and over again but with

00:01:40.439 --> 00:01:42.530 
same team over and over again but with
this<00:01:40.680> every<00:01:41.490> episode<00:01:42.030> is<00:01:42.180> going<00:01:42.390> to<00:01:42.450> be

00:01:42.530 --> 00:01:42.540 
this every episode is going to be

00:01:42.540 --> 00:01:44.359 
this every episode is going to be
different<00:01:42.780> and<00:01:43.110> I<00:01:43.200> can<00:01:43.380> take<00:01:43.530> your<00:01:43.770> advice<00:01:44.100> on

00:01:44.359 --> 00:01:44.369 
different and I can take your advice on

00:01:44.369 --> 00:01:46.340 
different and I can take your advice on
what<00:01:44.970> players<00:01:45.299> we<00:01:45.540> can<00:01:45.689> actually<00:01:45.810> bring<00:01:46.170> in

00:01:46.340 --> 00:01:46.350 
what players we can actually bring in

00:01:46.350 --> 00:01:48.440 
what players we can actually bring in
for<00:01:46.590> the<00:01:46.680> hybrid<00:01:47.220> on<00:01:47.430> what<00:01:47.850> coin<00:01:48.090> amount<00:01:48.329> we've

00:01:48.440 --> 00:01:48.450 
for the hybrid on what coin amount we've

00:01:48.450 --> 00:01:49.670 
for the hybrid on what coin amount we've
actually<00:01:48.600> got<00:01:48.869> to<00:01:49.020> spend<00:01:49.259> and<00:01:49.409> all<00:01:49.470> that<00:01:49.590> good

00:01:49.670 --> 00:01:49.680 
actually got to spend and all that good

00:01:49.680 --> 00:01:52.039 
actually got to spend and all that good
stuff<00:01:49.740> so<00:01:49.920> hopefully<00:01:50.360> it's<00:01:51.360> just<00:01:51.540> the<00:01:51.659> basics

00:01:52.039 --> 00:01:52.049 
stuff so hopefully it's just the basics

00:01:52.049 --> 00:01:54.260 
stuff so hopefully it's just the basics
really<00:01:52.229> right<00:01:52.619> now<00:01:52.829> it's<00:01:53.189> just<00:01:53.610> something<00:01:54.180> I'm

00:01:54.260 --> 00:01:54.270 
really right now it's just something I'm

00:01:54.270 --> 00:01:56.090 
really right now it's just something I'm
trying<00:01:54.299> to<00:01:54.659> think<00:01:54.720> of<00:01:55.020> how<00:01:55.200> it<00:01:55.380> could<00:01:55.560> work<00:01:55.799> but

00:01:56.090 --> 00:01:56.100 
trying to think of how it could work but

00:01:56.100 --> 00:01:57.830 
trying to think of how it could work but
yeah<00:01:56.700> that's<00:01:56.880> something<00:01:57.090> I<00:01:57.360> just<00:01:57.540> wanted<00:01:57.780> to

00:01:57.830 --> 00:01:57.840 
yeah that's something I just wanted to

00:01:57.840 --> 00:01:59.899 
yeah that's something I just wanted to
throw<00:01:58.049> at<00:01:58.259> you<00:01:58.469> to<00:01:58.890> see<00:01:58.920> if<00:01:59.219> you<00:01:59.310> can<00:01:59.490> maybe<00:01:59.610> add

00:01:59.899 --> 00:01:59.909 
throw at you to see if you can maybe add

00:01:59.909 --> 00:02:01.850 
throw at you to see if you can maybe add
on<00:02:00.149> it<00:02:00.329> improve<00:02:00.899> it<00:02:01.170> and<00:02:01.350> all<00:02:01.500> that<00:02:01.680> good<00:02:01.799> stuff

00:02:01.850 --> 00:02:01.860

section if you do like the sound of the

00:02:05.100 --> 00:02:07.520 
section if you do like the sound of the
actual<00:02:05.369> series<00:02:05.640> itself<00:02:05.909> drop<00:02:06.600> a<00:02:06.630> like<00:02:06.930> but<00:02:07.409> as

00:02:07.520 --> 00:02:07.530 
actual series itself drop a like but as

00:02:07.530 --> 00:02:09.740 
actual series itself drop a like but as
you<00:02:07.710> know<00:02:07.829> it<00:02:08.039> is<00:02:08.069> in<00:02:08.310> early<00:02:08.610> stages<00:02:08.879> I'm<00:02:09.270> still

00:02:09.740 --> 00:02:09.750 
you know it is in early stages I'm still

00:02:09.750 --> 00:02:12.200 
you know it is in early stages I'm still
yet<00:02:09.989> to<00:02:10.020> think<00:02:10.800> of<00:02:10.950> how<00:02:11.310> it<00:02:11.459> can<00:02:11.610> actually<00:02:11.760> work

00:02:12.200 --> 00:02:12.210 
yet to think of how it can actually work

00:02:12.210 --> 00:02:14.870 
yet to think of how it can actually work
with<00:02:12.390> like<00:02:12.990> basically<00:02:13.710> it's<00:02:14.280> the<00:02:14.340> rewards

00:02:14.870 --> 00:02:14.880 
with like basically it's the rewards

00:02:14.880 --> 00:02:16.460 
with like basically it's the rewards
that<00:02:15.030> I<00:02:15.090> want<00:02:15.420> to<00:02:15.510> hear<00:02:15.600> from<00:02:15.660> you<00:02:16.080> so<00:02:16.290> how

00:02:16.460 --> 00:02:16.470 
that I want to hear from you so how

00:02:16.470 --> 00:02:18.350 
that I want to hear from you so how
should<00:02:16.770> we<00:02:16.920> get<00:02:17.160> the<00:02:17.430> coin<00:02:17.670> amount<00:02:17.970> how<00:02:18.120> should

00:02:18.350 --> 00:02:18.360 
should we get the coin amount how should

00:02:18.360 --> 00:02:20.480 
should we get the coin amount how should
we<00:02:18.480> get<00:02:18.600> the<00:02:18.720> pack<00:02:18.930> amount<00:02:19.260> but<00:02:20.130> yeah<00:02:20.220> I<00:02:20.250> might

00:02:20.480 --> 00:02:20.490 
we get the pack amount but yeah I might

00:02:20.490 --> 00:02:22.100 
we get the pack amount but yeah I might
I<00:02:20.610> think<00:02:20.910> it<00:02:21.000> sounds<00:02:21.240> quite<00:02:21.360> good<00:02:21.540> I<00:02:21.750> think<00:02:21.990> it

00:02:22.100 --> 00:02:22.110 
I think it sounds quite good I think it

00:02:22.110 --> 00:02:23.450 
I think it sounds quite good I think it
sounds<00:02:22.350> good<00:02:22.500> i<00:02:22.530> think<00:02:22.560> it<00:02:22.800> could<00:02:22.920> work<00:02:23.100> very

00:02:23.450 --> 00:02:23.460 
sounds good i think it could work very

00:02:23.460 --> 00:02:25.250 
sounds good i think it could work very
very<00:02:23.520> well<00:02:23.790> and<00:02:24.120> it's<00:02:24.420> interesting<00:02:24.840> because

00:02:25.250 --> 00:02:25.260 
very well and it's interesting because

00:02:25.260 --> 00:02:27.560 
very well and it's interesting because
say<00:02:25.560> for<00:02:25.770> example<00:02:25.830> we<00:02:26.370> pack<00:02:26.610> like<00:02:27.180> some<00:02:27.360> hidden

00:02:27.560 --> 00:02:27.570 
say for example we pack like some hidden

00:02:27.570 --> 00:02:30.500 
say for example we pack like some hidden
gems<00:02:27.660> in<00:02:28.110> that<00:02:28.290> not<00:02:29.220> only<00:02:29.370> are<00:02:29.730> you<00:02:29.850> seeing

00:02:30.500 --> 00:02:30.510 
gems in that not only are you seeing

00:02:30.510 --> 00:02:31.970 
gems in that not only are you seeing
that<00:02:30.600> those<00:02:30.960> players<00:02:31.260> are<00:02:31.440> playing<00:02:31.530> well<00:02:31.800> but

00:02:31.970 --> 00:02:31.980 
that those players are playing well but

00:02:31.980 --> 00:02:33.380 
that those players are playing well but

00:02:33.380 --> 00:02:33.390 
you've got like a hybrid to take away
