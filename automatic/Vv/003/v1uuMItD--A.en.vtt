really awesome you get a figure of

00:00:20.520 --> 00:00:22.460 
really awesome you get a figure of
course<00:00:20.789> you<00:00:21.330> can<00:00:21.449> get<00:00:21.570> a<00:00:21.600> cyber<00:00:21.930> end<00:00:22.140> dragon

obstruction or majestic a star dragon
majestic<00:00:26.849> red<00:00:27.060> dragon<00:00:27.090> which<00:00:27.599> I<00:00:27.779> think<00:00:27.990> we've

00:00:28.099 --> 00:00:28.109 
majestic red dragon which I think we've

00:00:28.109 --> 00:00:29.269 
majestic red dragon which I think we've
opened<00:00:28.439> those<00:00:28.560> two<00:00:28.769> I<00:00:28.800> think<00:00:28.890> those<00:00:29.099> are<00:00:29.220> only

00:00:29.269 --> 00:00:29.279 
opened those two I think those are only

00:00:29.279 --> 00:00:30.950 
opened those two I think those are only
two<00:00:29.490> we've<00:00:29.640> gotten<00:00:29.849> so<00:00:29.970> far<00:00:30.000> so<00:00:30.720> let's<00:00:30.840> see

00:00:30.950 --> 00:00:30.960 
two we've gotten so far so let's see

00:00:30.960 --> 00:00:34.370 
two we've gotten so far so let's see
what's<00:00:31.140> in<00:00:31.260> this<00:00:31.380> one<00:00:31.619> they're<00:00:31.769> all<00:00:31.890> random<00:00:33.380> so

00:00:34.370 --> 00:00:34.380 
what's in this one they're all random so

00:00:34.380 --> 00:00:39.139 
what's in this one they're all random so
for<00:00:34.829> this<00:00:35.160> one<00:00:36.559> we<00:00:37.559> have<00:00:37.860> rainbow<00:00:38.579> dragon<00:00:38.850> I

00:00:39.139 --> 00:00:39.149 
for this one we have rainbow dragon I

00:00:39.149 --> 00:00:40.729 
for this one we have rainbow dragon I
guess<00:00:39.329> yeah<00:00:39.660> because<00:00:39.840> there's<00:00:40.020> the<00:00:40.230> dual

00:00:40.729 --> 00:00:40.739 
guess yeah because there's the dual

00:00:40.739 --> 00:00:42.850 
guess yeah because there's the dual
terminal<00:00:41.070> card<00:00:41.280> so<00:00:41.489> let's<00:00:41.520> see<00:00:42.000> the<00:00:42.149> figure

00:00:42.850 --> 00:00:42.860 
terminal card so let's see the figure

00:00:42.860 --> 00:00:46.279 
terminal card so let's see the figure
all<00:00:43.860> right<00:00:44.010> here<00:00:44.430> is<00:00:44.840> better<00:00:45.840> cut<00:00:46.020> into<00:00:46.200> the

00:00:46.279 --> 00:00:46.289 
all right here is better cut into the

00:00:46.289 --> 00:00:49.279 
all right here is better cut into the
plastic<00:00:46.620> real<00:00:46.829> quick<00:00:47.239> yeah<00:00:48.239> of<00:00:48.780> course

00:00:49.279 --> 00:00:49.289 
plastic real quick yeah of course

00:00:49.289 --> 00:00:50.930 
plastic real quick yeah of course
with<00:00:49.469> these<00:00:49.620> you<00:00:49.680> would<00:00:50.129> put<00:00:50.700> them<00:00:50.820> together

00:00:50.930 --> 00:00:50.940 
with these you would put them together

00:00:50.940 --> 00:00:52.819 
with these you would put them together
and<00:00:51.390> then<00:00:51.539> bull<00:00:51.870> stands<00:00:52.289> you<00:00:52.379> put<00:00:52.590> it<00:00:52.649> on<00:00:52.710> the

00:00:52.819 --> 00:00:52.829 
and then bull stands you put it on the

00:00:52.829 --> 00:00:54.260 
and then bull stands you put it on the
dual<00:00:52.980> terminal<00:00:53.370> and<00:00:53.579> I<00:00:53.610> guess<00:00:53.820> it<00:00:53.969> would<00:00:54.090> allow

00:00:54.260 --> 00:00:54.270 
dual terminal and I guess it would allow

00:00:54.270 --> 00:00:56.360 
dual terminal and I guess it would allow
you<00:00:54.329> to<00:00:54.660> use<00:00:55.469> the<00:00:55.620> monster<00:00:56.010> in<00:00:56.129> the<00:00:56.219> dual

00:00:56.360 --> 00:00:56.370 
you to use the monster in the dual

00:00:56.370 --> 00:00:57.889 
you to use the monster in the dual
terminal<00:00:56.820> I<00:00:56.969> guess<00:00:57.300> I<00:00:57.539> don't<00:00:57.600> know<00:00:57.719> if<00:00:57.809> this

00:00:57.889 --> 00:00:57.899 
terminal I guess I don't know if this

00:00:57.899 --> 00:00:59.209 
terminal I guess I don't know if this
would<00:00:58.020> even<00:00:58.230> work<00:00:58.379> with<00:00:58.590> our<00:00:58.710> don't<00:00:58.920> care<00:00:59.070> else

00:00:59.209 --> 00:00:59.219 
would even work with our don't care else

00:00:59.219 --> 00:01:02.479 
would even work with our don't care else
-<00:00:59.370> I<00:00:59.489> tend<00:01:00.059> to<00:01:00.090> try<00:01:00.539> now<00:01:00.719> though<00:01:01.250> alright<00:01:02.250> see

00:01:02.479 --> 00:01:02.489 
- I tend to try now though alright see

00:01:02.489 --> 00:01:04.460 
- I tend to try now though alright see
if<00:01:02.579> there's<00:01:02.760> all<00:01:03.000> different<00:01:03.480> pieces<00:01:03.600> I<00:01:04.049> am

00:01:04.460 --> 00:01:04.470 
if there's all different pieces I am

00:01:04.470 --> 00:01:06.260 
if there's all different pieces I am
going<00:01:04.769> to<00:01:04.979> cut<00:01:05.250> the<00:01:05.369> video<00:01:05.460> right<00:01:05.729> here<00:01:05.909> and

00:01:06.260 --> 00:01:06.270

know rainbow dragon right there in
Japanese<00:01:24.770> and<00:01:25.770> yeah<00:01:25.860> you<00:01:25.920> can<00:01:26.189> put<00:01:26.340> the<00:01:26.400> little

00:01:26.539 --> 00:01:26.549 
Japanese and yeah you can put the little

00:01:26.549 --> 00:01:28.070 
Japanese and yeah you can put the little
code<00:01:26.820> thing<00:01:27.060> at<00:01:27.180> the<00:01:27.330> bottom<00:01:27.600> they<00:01:27.840> come<00:01:27.990> with

00:01:28.070 --> 00:01:28.080 
code thing at the bottom they come with

00:01:28.080 --> 00:01:29.240 
code thing at the bottom they come with
like<00:01:28.200> a<00:01:28.259> little<00:01:28.350> code<00:01:28.560> thing<00:01:28.770> I<00:01:28.890> guess<00:01:29.040> that's

00:01:29.240 --> 00:01:29.250 
like a little code thing I guess that's

00:01:29.250 --> 00:01:31.609 
like a little code thing I guess that's
what<00:01:29.549> skins<00:01:29.909> the<00:01:30.210> the<00:01:30.659> cardian<00:01:31.110> or<00:01:31.290> the<00:01:31.380> figure

00:01:31.609 --> 00:01:31.619 
what skins the the cardian or the figure

00:01:31.619 --> 00:01:34.010 
what skins the the cardian or the figure
in<00:01:31.770> and<00:01:32.130> of<00:01:33.000> course<00:01:33.150> also<00:01:33.450> you<00:01:33.509> get<00:01:33.659> a<00:01:33.720> dual

00:01:34.010 --> 00:01:34.020 
in and of course also you get a dual

00:01:34.020 --> 00:01:35.030 
in and of course also you get a dual
terminal<00:01:34.350> version<00:01:34.530> of<00:01:34.619> the<00:01:34.710> card<00:01:34.890> like<00:01:34.920> you
