 the invoice and the materials are negative 

00:02:51.270 --> 00:02:54.810
 which leave a little to be desired for 

00:02:52.680 --> 00:02:56.700
 regarding the front panel e 

00:02:54.810 --> 00:02:59.459

 for grids and dust filters beyond 

00:02:59.459 --> 00:03:03.390
 that to the lack of a predisposition 

00:03:00.810 --> 00:03:08.090
 with additional fans or a system of 

00:03:03.390 --> 00:03:08.090

00:03:20.900 --> 00:03:26.540
 video was helpful and if you knew 

00:03:22.730 --> 00:03:29.260
