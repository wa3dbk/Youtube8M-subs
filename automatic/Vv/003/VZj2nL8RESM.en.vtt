and<00:01:54.020> then<00:01:54.050> you<00:01:54.200> going<00:01:54.320> to<00:01:54.380> paste<00:01:54.530> around<00:01:54.680> each

00:01:54.970 --> 00:01:54.980 
and then you going to paste around each

00:01:54.980 --> 00:01:57.790 
and then you going to paste around each
port<00:01:55.310> make<00:01:55.490> sure<00:01:55.640> you<00:01:55.760> have<00:01:55.880> a<00:01:56.800> enough

00:01:57.790 --> 00:01:57.800 
port make sure you have a enough

00:01:57.800 --> 00:01:59.649 
port make sure you have a enough
material<00:01:58.670> around<00:01:58.820> the<00:01:59.000> port<00:01:59.210> so<00:01:59.330> you<00:01:59.390> can't

00:01:59.649 --> 00:01:59.659 
material around the port so you can't

00:01:59.659 --> 00:02:02.890 
material around the port so you can't
see<00:01:59.930> through<00:02:00.170> to<00:02:00.380> the<00:02:00.409> base<00:02:00.680> and<00:02:01.600> then<00:02:02.600> put<00:02:02.780> an

00:02:02.890 --> 00:02:02.900 
see through to the base and then put an

00:02:02.900 --> 00:02:05.320 
see through to the base and then put an
inch<00:02:03.170> and<00:02:03.320> a<00:02:03.380> half<00:02:03.409> wide<00:02:03.500> band<00:02:03.980> in<00:02:04.190> between<00:02:04.330> the

00:02:11.510 --> 00:02:11.520 

00:02:11.520 --> 00:02:14.220 

this<00:02:12.520> is<00:02:12.670> one<00:02:13.030> of<00:02:13.060> the<00:02:13.240> two<00:02:13.420> most<00:02:13.630> important

00:02:14.220 --> 00:02:14.230 
this is one of the two most important

00:02:14.230 --> 00:02:23.290 
this is one of the two most important
parts<00:02:14.890> of<00:02:14.980> the<00:02:15.100> process

00:02:23.290 --> 00:02:23.300 

00:02:23.300 --> 00:02:25.580 

you're<00:02:24.300> gonna<00:02:24.390> want<00:02:24.630> to<00:02:24.750> make<00:02:25.200> sure<00:02:25.380> there

00:02:25.580 --> 00:02:25.590 
you're gonna want to make sure there

00:02:25.590 --> 00:02:28.400 
you're gonna want to make sure there
aren't<00:02:25.709> any<00:02:25.890> little<00:02:26.250> veins<00:02:26.550> of<00:02:26.849> threats<00:02:27.410> that

00:04:22.169 --> 00:04:23.900 
particular example we stopped injecting
probably<00:04:22.500> eight<00:04:22.860> to<00:04:23.160> ten<00:04:23.370> inches<00:04:23.639> from<00:04:23.820> the

00:04:23.900 --> 00:04:23.910 
probably eight to ten inches from the

00:04:23.910 --> 00:04:25.279 
probably eight to ten inches from the
top<00:04:24.120> and<00:04:24.270> you'll<00:04:24.419> still<00:04:24.630> see<00:04:24.870> at<00:04:24.960> the<00:04:25.080> end<00:04:25.200> of

00:04:25.279 --> 00:04:25.289 
top and you'll still see at the end of

00:04:25.289 --> 00:04:26.690 
top and you'll still see at the end of
this<00:04:25.350> video<00:04:25.680> the<00:04:25.830> urethane<00:04:26.039> came<00:04:26.370> out<00:04:26.520> the<00:04:26.669> top

00:04:26.690 --> 00:04:26.700 
this video the urethane came out the top

00:04:26.700 --> 00:04:28.640 
this video the urethane came out the top
so<00:04:27.150> it<00:04:27.510> does<00:04:27.720> go<00:04:27.900> all<00:04:28.080> the<00:04:28.229> way<00:04:28.260> through<00:04:28.500> the

00:04:28.640 --> 00:04:28.650 
so it does go all the way through the

00:04:28.650 --> 00:04:32.159 
so it does go all the way through the
wall<00:04:28.830> it<00:04:29.340> expands<00:04:29.789> and<00:04:30.000> plugs<00:04:30.240> very<00:04:30.570> nicely

00:04:32.159 --> 00:04:32.169 
wall it expands and plugs very nicely

00:04:32.169 --> 00:04:34.950 
wall it expands and plugs very nicely
and<00:04:32.919> I'm<00:04:33.370> like<00:04:33.550> epoxy<00:04:33.999> if<00:04:34.449> you<00:04:34.569> have<00:04:34.689> a<00:04:34.719> little

00:04:34.950 --> 00:04:34.960 
and I'm like epoxy if you have a little

00:04:34.960 --> 00:04:37.260 
and I'm like epoxy if you have a little
week<00:04:35.259> as<00:04:35.770> you<00:04:35.979> see<00:04:36.159> it<00:04:36.280> if<00:04:36.430> the<00:04:36.639> earthing<00:04:36.969> plugs

00:04:37.260 --> 00:04:37.270 
week as you see it if the earthing plugs

00:04:37.270 --> 00:04:41.519 
week as you see it if the earthing plugs
itself<00:04:37.719> and<00:04:37.960> makes<00:04:38.439> for<00:04:38.939> the<00:04:40.050> excellent<00:04:41.050> water

00:04:41.519 --> 00:04:41.529 
itself and makes for the excellent water

00:04:41.529 --> 00:04:44.790 
itself and makes for the excellent water
stopper<00:04:42.719> it<00:04:43.719> will<00:04:43.870> fade<00:04:44.110> out<00:04:44.289> here<00:04:44.590> and<00:04:44.740> you're

00:04:44.790 --> 00:04:44.800 
stopper it will fade out here and you're

00:04:44.800 --> 00:04:46.320 
stopper it will fade out here and you're
going<00:04:44.919> to<00:04:44.979> see<00:04:45.159> the<00:04:45.310> completed<00:04:45.639> repair<00:04:46.090> with
