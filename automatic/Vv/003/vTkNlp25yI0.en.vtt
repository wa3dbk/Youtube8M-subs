00:00:09.740 --> 00:00:16.340
 but the ground of the first level now 

00:00:13.560 --> 00:00:16.340
 in the afternoon 

00:00:19.550 --> 00:00:24.850
 I am 

00:00:21.539 --> 00:00:26.660
 and a vice that neither the devil 

00:00:24.850 --> 00:00:29.230
 I am learning 

00:00:26.660 --> 00:00:29.230
 user 

00:00:29.640 --> 00:00:32.390
 programming 

00:00:36.530 --> 00:00:39.790
 it's just like a tutorial that is here very 

00:00:38.870 --> 00:00:41.970
 all right 

00:00:39.790 --> 00:00:44.370
 I'll probably leave the link 

00:00:41.970 --> 00:00:48.470
 description what it is that I have taken 

00:00:44.370 --> 00:00:48.470
 some things in a tutorial 

00:00:49.280 --> 00:00:55.020
 they have mixed everything 

00:00:52.280 --> 00:00:58.030
 then 

00:00:55.020 --> 00:01:00.660
 I lack many things 

00:00:58.030 --> 00:01:00.660
 but stay 

00:01:03.420 --> 00:01:09.330
 I have to design 

00:01:06.540 --> 00:01:11.550
 the map not the maps I have to add 

00:01:09.330 --> 00:01:15.080
 effects let's do a lot of 

00:01:11.550 --> 00:01:19.630
 shit a lot of things and nothing 

00:01:15.080 --> 00:01:19.630
 I wanted to just teach him to 

00:01:24.230 --> 00:01:29.600
 I have to do the maps and I have to 

00:01:27.200 --> 00:01:33.200
 do that when you go killing certain 

00:01:29.600 --> 00:01:36.110
 amount of probe the change that 

00:01:33.200 --> 00:01:40.360
 they add to answer and that the zombies will 

00:01:36.110 --> 00:01:40.360
 kill because for the demo they do not kill you 

00:01:43.560 --> 00:01:48.350
 from the shit 

00:01:45.560 --> 00:01:51.530
 and nothing for 

00:01:48.350 --> 00:01:54.369
 to see music is not music 

00:01:51.530 --> 00:01:54.369
 definitive 

00:01:54.500 --> 00:01:58.030
 I have a couple of friends who are 

00:01:58.280 --> 00:02:05.030
 a metalhead 

00:02:02.090 --> 00:02:07.150
 and I'm going to see if they donate me even if it's a 

00:02:05.030 --> 00:02:09.640
 theme or two 

00:02:07.150 --> 00:02:12.460
 for the title another for the game and another 

00:02:09.640 --> 00:02:14.110
 for credit any good shit like 

00:02:12.460 --> 00:02:16.170
 I wanted to be in the credits so I 

00:02:14.110 --> 00:02:20.480
 it suits 

00:02:16.170 --> 00:02:23.020
 I'm going to leave the game and there they see it 

00:02:20.480 --> 00:02:25.620
 and I'm going 

00:02:23.020 --> 00:02:25.620
 in the game
