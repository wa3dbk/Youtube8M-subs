device<00:00:20.869> right<00:00:21.050> here<00:00:21.109> again<00:00:21.919> I<00:00:21.949> prefer<00:00:22.189> to<00:00:22.490> use

00:00:22.509 --> 00:00:22.519 
device right here again I prefer to use

00:00:22.519 --> 00:00:27.819 
device right here again I prefer to use
my<00:00:22.640> hands<00:00:24.789> but<00:00:25.789> I'll<00:00:26.239> show<00:00:26.480> you<00:00:26.509> how<00:00:26.869> to<00:00:27.560> wrap

00:00:27.819 --> 00:00:27.829 
my hands but I'll show you how to wrap

00:00:27.829 --> 00:00:30.909 
my hands but I'll show you how to wrap
them<00:00:28.039> with<00:00:28.070> the<00:00:28.220> hand<00:00:28.429> wrapper<00:00:28.669> the<00:00:29.029> same<00:00:29.919> just

00:00:30.909 --> 00:00:30.919 
them with the hand wrapper the same just

00:00:30.919 --> 00:00:33.330 
them with the hand wrapper the same just
like<00:00:30.949> we<00:00:31.099> did<00:00:31.249> before

00:00:33.330 --> 00:00:33.340 
like we did before

00:00:33.340 --> 00:00:35.950 

we'll<00:00:34.340> just<00:00:34.460> spin<00:00:34.699> it<00:00:34.850> and<00:00:35.000> the<00:00:35.300> blocks

00:00:35.950 --> 00:00:35.960 
we'll just spin it and the blocks

00:00:35.960 --> 00:00:40.299 
we'll just spin it and the blocks
I<00:00:36.010> put<00:00:37.010> masking<00:00:37.309> tape<00:00:37.489> in<00:00:37.609> my<00:00:37.640> box<00:00:38.030> I<00:00:39.100> think<00:00:40.100> it

00:00:40.299 --> 00:00:40.309 
I put masking tape in my box I think it

00:00:40.309 --> 00:00:43.810 
I put masking tape in my box I think it
helps<00:00:40.550> a<00:00:40.809> little<00:00:41.809> bit<00:00:42.050> but<00:00:42.350> again<00:00:42.530> all<00:00:43.370> we<00:00:43.670> do

00:00:43.810 --> 00:00:43.820 
helps a little bit but again all we do

00:00:43.820 --> 00:00:47.979 
helps a little bit but again all we do
is<00:00:43.969> make<00:00:44.390> the<00:00:44.510> cross<00:00:46.000> start<00:00:47.000> our<00:00:47.090> reps<00:00:47.390> as<00:00:47.929> you

00:00:47.979 --> 00:00:47.989 
is make the cross start our reps as you

00:00:47.989 --> 00:00:51.270 
is make the cross start our reps as you
can<00:00:48.109> see<00:00:48.410> it's<00:00:49.280> a<00:00:49.370> little<00:00:49.489> more<00:00:49.730> difficult<00:00:50.210> I

00:00:51.270 --> 00:00:51.280 
can see it's a little more difficult I

00:00:51.280 --> 00:00:54.240 
can see it's a little more difficult I
don't<00:00:52.280> have<00:00:52.399> two<00:00:52.609> hands-free<00:00:53.149> if<00:00:53.329> I<00:00:53.449> want<00:00:53.690> I

00:00:54.240 --> 00:00:54.250 
don't have two hands-free if I want I

00:00:54.250 --> 00:00:56.560 
don't have two hands-free if I want I
would<00:00:55.250> if<00:00:55.339> I<00:00:55.399> use<00:00:55.550> the<00:00:55.640> tensioning<00:00:56.000> device<00:00:56.269> but

00:00:56.560 --> 00:00:56.570 
would if I use the tensioning device but

00:00:56.570 --> 00:01:00.729 
would if I use the tensioning device but
the<00:00:57.410> the<00:00:57.800> rod<00:00:57.980> wrapper<00:00:58.960> power<00:00:59.960> wrapper<00:01:00.260> really

00:01:00.729 --> 00:01:00.739 
the the rod wrapper power wrapper really

00:01:00.739 --> 00:01:06.670 
the the rod wrapper power wrapper really
allows<00:01:01.640> me<00:01:01.670> to<00:01:04.720> have<00:01:05.720> full<00:01:05.990> control<00:01:06.320> over<00:01:06.439> what

00:01:06.670 --> 00:01:06.680 
allows me to have full control over what

00:01:06.680 --> 00:01:09.130 
allows me to have full control over what
I'm<00:01:06.890> doing<00:01:07.250> but<00:01:07.759> if<00:01:08.150> you<00:01:08.210> don't<00:01:08.479> you<00:01:09.020> know

00:01:09.130 --> 00:01:09.140 
I'm doing but if you don't you know

00:01:09.140 --> 00:01:10.390 
I'm doing but if you don't you know
you're<00:01:09.350> not<00:01:09.470> sure<00:01:09.650> if<00:01:09.740> you<00:01:09.799> want<00:01:09.890> to<00:01:09.979> build<00:01:10.100> a

00:01:10.390 --> 00:01:10.400 
you're not sure if you want to build a

00:01:10.400 --> 00:01:16.960 
you're not sure if you want to build a
ton<00:01:10.700> of<00:01:10.729> rods<00:01:11.000> or<00:01:14.409> that's<00:01:15.409> what<00:01:15.590> happens<00:01:15.970> so

00:01:16.960 --> 00:01:16.970 
ton of rods or that's what happens so

00:01:16.970 --> 00:01:20.560 
ton of rods or that's what happens so
just<00:01:17.180> like<00:01:17.329> with<00:01:17.450> the<00:01:17.799> power<00:01:18.799> wrapper<00:01:19.570> all

00:01:20.560 --> 00:01:20.570 
just like with the power wrapper all

00:01:20.570 --> 00:01:22.600 
just like with the power wrapper all
we're<00:01:20.750> going<00:01:20.840> to<00:01:20.899> do<00:01:21.049> is<00:01:21.200> just<00:01:21.430> tuck<00:01:22.430> our

00:01:22.600 --> 00:01:22.610 
we're going to do is just tuck our

00:01:22.610 --> 00:01:25.660 
we're going to do is just tuck our
thread<00:01:22.880> against<00:01:23.149> itself<00:01:24.100> wrap<00:01:25.100> up<00:01:25.280> on<00:01:25.460> the

00:01:25.660 --> 00:01:25.670 
thread against itself wrap up on the

00:01:25.670 --> 00:01:31.450 
thread against itself wrap up on the
guide<00:01:25.850> foot

00:01:31.450 --> 00:01:31.460 

00:01:31.460 --> 00:01:55.649 

we'll<00:01:32.460> wrap<00:01:32.670> all<00:01:32.880> the<00:01:33.000> way<00:01:33.120> up<00:01:33.300> tie<00:01:33.840> it<00:01:33.900> off

00:01:55.649 --> 00:01:55.659 

00:01:55.659 --> 00:02:01.980 

sure

00:02:01.980 --> 00:02:01.990 

00:02:01.990 --> 00:02:05.260 

all<00:02:02.990> right<00:02:03.250> slide<00:02:04.250> the<00:02:04.400> quick<00:02:04.610> pull<00:02:04.820> in<00:02:05.030> there

00:02:05.260 --> 00:02:05.270 
all right slide the quick pull in there

00:02:05.270 --> 00:02:06.910 
all right slide the quick pull in there
make<00:02:06.020> sure<00:02:06.049> our<00:02:06.200> loops<00:02:06.500> in<00:02:06.680> the<00:02:06.770> right

00:02:06.910 --> 00:02:06.920 
make sure our loops in the right

00:02:06.920 --> 00:02:09.249 
make sure our loops in the right
direction<00:02:07.330> which<00:02:08.330> is<00:02:08.539> the<00:02:08.750> direction<00:02:08.780> we're

00:02:09.249 --> 00:02:09.259 
direction which is the direction we're

00:02:09.259 --> 00:02:14.380 
direction which is the direction we're
wrapping<00:02:11.020> put<00:02:12.190> four<00:02:13.190> or<00:02:13.220> five<00:02:13.310> wraps<00:02:13.849> on<00:02:14.120> there

00:02:14.380 --> 00:02:14.390 
wrapping put four or five wraps on there

00:02:14.390 --> 00:02:27.190 
wrapping put four or five wraps on there
five<00:02:15.230> or<00:02:15.440> six<00:02:15.620> to<00:02:15.770> be<00:02:15.890> safe

00:02:27.190 --> 00:02:27.200 

00:02:27.200 --> 00:02:30.080 

should<00:02:28.200> get<00:02:28.379> better<00:02:28.530> tension<00:02:28.980> on<00:02:29.099> it<00:02:29.129> again

00:02:30.080 --> 00:02:30.090 
should get better tension on it again

00:02:30.090 --> 00:02:34.940 
should get better tension on it again
another<00:02:30.720> reason<00:02:30.959> I<00:02:31.140> prefer<00:02:31.579> power<00:02:32.579> rapper<00:02:33.950> but

00:02:34.940 --> 00:02:34.950 
another reason I prefer power rapper but

00:02:34.950 --> 00:02:42.220 
another reason I prefer power rapper but
that's<00:02:35.430> actually<00:02:36.000> my<00:02:36.360> fault

00:02:42.220 --> 00:02:42.230 

00:02:42.230 --> 00:02:58.640 

there's<00:02:43.230> our<00:02:43.379> rep<00:02:44.810> done<00:02:45.810> by<00:02:46.019> hand

00:02:58.640 --> 00:02:58.650 

00:02:58.650 --> 00:03:07.500 

tighten<00:02:59.650> the<00:02:59.709> gaps<00:03:00.159> up<00:03:06.209> use<00:03:07.209> a<00:03:07.239> burnishing

00:03:07.500 --> 00:03:07.510 
tighten the gaps up use a burnishing

00:03:07.510 --> 00:03:16.559 
tighten the gaps up use a burnishing
tool<00:03:07.720> fill<00:03:08.200> in<00:03:08.290> those<00:03:08.409> gaps<00:03:15.209> you're<00:03:16.209> a<00:03:16.269> sharp

00:03:16.559 --> 00:03:16.569 
tool fill in those gaps you're a sharp

00:03:16.569 --> 00:03:25.770 
tool fill in those gaps you're a sharp
looking<00:03:16.750> guy

00:03:25.770 --> 00:03:25.780 

00:03:25.780 --> 00:03:27.840
