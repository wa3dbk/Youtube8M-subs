swift-tuttle comet which swings past the
Sun<00:01:24.030> every<00:01:25.040> 131<00:01:26.040> hundred<00:01:26.250> thirty<00:01:26.430> years<00:01:26.670> it

00:01:26.840 --> 00:01:26.850 
Sun every 131 hundred thirty years it

00:01:26.850 --> 00:01:28.880 
Sun every 131 hundred thirty years it
replenishes<00:01:27.330> this<00:01:27.900> trail<00:01:28.170> of<00:01:28.200> debris<00:01:28.530> and

00:01:28.880 --> 00:01:28.890 
replenishes this trail of debris and

00:01:28.890 --> 00:01:32.420 
replenishes this trail of debris and
that's<00:01:29.280> made<00:01:29.490> up<00:01:29.610> of<00:01:29.990> space<00:01:30.990> rock<00:01:31.500> as<00:01:31.979> big<00:01:32.250> as<00:01:32.400> a

00:01:32.420 --> 00:01:32.430 
that's made up of space rock as big as a

00:01:32.430 --> 00:01:34.819 
that's made up of space rock as big as a
meter<00:01:32.729> across<00:01:32.909> down<00:01:33.750> to<00:01:33.900> tiny<00:01:34.170> grains<00:01:34.530> of<00:01:34.680> sand

00:01:34.819 --> 00:01:34.829 
meter across down to tiny grains of sand

00:01:34.829 --> 00:01:36.289 
meter across down to tiny grains of sand
so<00:01:35.009> each<00:01:35.130> one<00:01:35.159> of<00:01:35.340> these<00:01:35.520> shooting<00:01:35.790> stars<00:01:35.820> is

00:01:36.289 --> 00:01:36.299 
so each one of these shooting stars is

00:01:36.299 --> 00:01:38.390 
so each one of these shooting stars is
one<00:01:37.079> of<00:01:37.200> these<00:01:37.380> things<00:01:37.710> and<00:01:37.890> it<00:01:38.009> goes<00:01:38.130> fast

00:01:38.390 --> 00:01:38.400 
one of these things and it goes fast

00:01:38.400 --> 00:01:40.340 
one of these things and it goes fast
hundreds<00:01:39.150> of<00:01:39.299> thousands<00:01:39.750> of<00:01:39.810> kilometres<00:01:40.229> an

river<00:02:07.710> and<00:02:07.979> this<00:02:08.550> river<00:02:08.819> is<00:02:08.910> not<00:02:09.030> made<00:02:09.300> with

00:02:09.619 --> 00:02:09.629 
river and this river is not made with

00:02:09.629 --> 00:02:12.680 
river and this river is not made with
the<00:02:09.920> with<00:02:10.920> drop<00:02:11.310> of<00:02:11.489> water<00:02:11.640> but<00:02:12.030> droplets<00:02:12.599> of

00:02:12.680 --> 00:02:12.690 
the with drop of water but droplets of

00:02:12.690 --> 00:02:13.370 
the with drop of water but droplets of
rock

00:02:13.370 --> 00:02:13.380 
rock

00:02:13.380 --> 00:02:15.640 
rock
of<00:02:13.470> Little<00:02:13.770> Rock's<00:02:14.070> and<00:02:14.400> so<00:02:14.610> the<00:02:14.760> earth<00:02:14.880> is<00:02:15.090> is

00:02:15.640 --> 00:02:15.650 
of Little Rock's and so the earth is is

00:02:15.650 --> 00:02:19.370 
of Little Rock's and so the earth is is
is<00:02:16.650> crossing<00:02:17.130> that<00:02:17.280> River<00:02:17.940> and<00:02:18.330> so<00:02:18.540> the<00:02:18.720> rate

00:02:19.370 --> 00:02:19.380 
is crossing that River and so the rate

00:02:19.380 --> 00:02:22.880 
is crossing that River and so the rate
of<00:02:19.410> shooting<00:02:20.070> star<00:02:20.310> is<00:02:20.460> increasing<00:02:21.150> a<00:02:21.350> lot<00:02:22.350> so

00:02:22.880 --> 00:02:22.890 
of shooting star is increasing a lot so

00:02:22.890 --> 00:02:24.680 
of shooting star is increasing a lot so
how<00:02:23.040> far<00:02:23.340> away<00:02:23.520> are<00:02:23.820> they<00:02:23.970> I<00:02:24.000> mean<00:02:24.090> are<00:02:24.540> they

00:02:24.680 --> 00:02:24.690 
how far away are they I mean are they

00:02:24.690 --> 00:02:26.330 
how far away are they I mean are they
all<00:02:24.810> hitting<00:02:25.020> the<00:02:25.170> atmosphere<00:02:25.290> so<00:02:25.710> they're

00:02:26.330 --> 00:02:26.340 
all hitting the atmosphere so they're

00:02:26.340 --> 00:02:28.340 
all hitting the atmosphere so they're
all<00:02:26.460> about<00:02:26.730> it<00:02:26.910> we<00:02:27.120> equal<00:02:27.660> equal<00:02:27.960> distance

00:02:28.340 --> 00:02:28.350 
all about it we equal equal distance

00:02:28.350 --> 00:02:29.870 
all about it we equal equal distance
from<00:02:28.410> from<00:02:28.830> the<00:02:28.920> planet<00:02:29.340> that's<00:02:29.610> a<00:02:29.700> good

00:02:29.870 --> 00:02:29.880 
from from the planet that's a good

00:02:29.880 --> 00:02:32.660 
from from the planet that's a good
question<00:02:30.060> in<00:02:30.390> fact<00:02:30.630> now<00:02:31.590> can<00:02:32.040> it<00:02:32.070> was<00:02:32.640> a

00:02:32.660 --> 00:02:32.670 
question in fact now can it was a

00:02:32.670 --> 00:02:34.760 
question in fact now can it was a
mystery<00:02:33.420> for<00:02:33.450> a<00:02:33.600> long<00:02:33.720> time<00:02:33.960> but<00:02:34.140> now<00:02:34.350> we<00:02:34.410> know

00:02:34.760 --> 00:02:34.770 
mystery for a long time but now we know

00:02:34.770 --> 00:02:38.390 
mystery for a long time but now we know
that<00:02:35.240> these<00:02:36.240> these<00:02:36.810> cosmic<00:02:37.650> grains<00:02:37.920> our<00:02:38.130> vApp

00:02:38.390 --> 00:02:38.400 
that these these cosmic grains our vApp

00:02:38.400 --> 00:02:43.010 
that these these cosmic grains our vApp
rising<00:02:38.940> approximately<00:02:41.180> 100<00:02:42.180> kilometers<00:02:42.780> high

rising approximately 100 kilometers high

00:02:43.020 --> 00:02:46.190 
rising approximately 100 kilometers high
above<00:02:43.980> our<00:02:44.220> head<00:02:44.550> but<00:02:45.120> that's<00:02:45.420> not<00:02:45.660> there's

00:02:46.190 --> 00:02:46.200 
above our head but that's not there's

00:02:46.200 --> 00:02:48.140 
above our head but that's not there's
some<00:02:46.380> variation<00:02:47.040> in<00:02:47.370> because<00:02:47.790> because

00:02:48.140 --> 00:02:48.150 
some variation in because because

00:02:48.150 --> 00:02:50.480 
some variation in because because
depending<00:02:48.450> on<00:02:48.720> the<00:02:48.870> size<00:02:49.140> of<00:02:49.350> the<00:02:49.440> grain<00:02:49.710> maybe

00:02:50.480 --> 00:02:50.490 
depending on the size of the grain maybe

00:02:50.490 --> 00:02:53.390 
depending on the size of the grain maybe
if<00:02:50.730> it's<00:02:50.910> a<00:02:51.210> bigger<00:02:51.990> it<00:02:52.290> can<00:02:52.530> it<00:02:52.920> can<00:02:52.980> penetrate

00:02:53.390 --> 00:02:53.400 
if it's a bigger it can it can penetrate

00:02:53.400 --> 00:02:56.360 
if it's a bigger it can it can penetrate
more<00:02:54.240> deeply<00:02:54.300> in<00:02:54.810> the<00:02:54.930> atmosphere<00:02:55.620> and<00:02:55.800> so<00:02:56.220> it

00:02:56.360 --> 00:02:56.370 
more deeply in the atmosphere and so it

00:02:56.370 --> 00:02:59.630 
more deeply in the atmosphere and so it
can<00:02:56.550> vaporize<00:02:56.790> more<00:02:57.540> in<00:02:58.020> at<00:02:58.890> a<00:02:58.920> lower<00:02:59.310> altitude

00:02:59.630 --> 00:02:59.640 
can vaporize more in at a lower altitude

00:02:59.640 --> 00:03:03.890 
can vaporize more in at a lower altitude
and<00:03:00.240> if<00:03:00.690> the<00:03:01.380> rack<00:03:01.620> is<00:03:02.210> wide<00:03:03.210> enough<00:03:03.390> maybe

00:03:03.890 --> 00:03:03.900 
and if the rack is wide enough maybe

00:03:03.900 --> 00:03:07.250 
and if the rack is wide enough maybe
around<00:03:04.710> 1<00:03:05.040> meter<00:03:05.340> wide<00:03:05.700> it<00:03:06.000> can<00:03:06.480> even<00:03:06.690> survive

00:03:07.250 --> 00:03:07.260 
around 1 meter wide it can even survive

00:03:07.260 --> 00:03:10.430 
around 1 meter wide it can even survive
its<00:03:07.680> atmospheric<00:03:08.520> entry<00:03:08.790> and<00:03:09.300> then<00:03:09.990> it<00:03:10.230> can

00:03:10.430 --> 00:03:10.440 
its atmospheric entry and then it can

00:03:10.440 --> 00:03:13.070 
its atmospheric entry and then it can
eat<00:03:10.650> the<00:03:10.950> ground<00:03:11.190> and<00:03:11.490> then<00:03:12.030> that's<00:03:12.420> when<00:03:12.570> we

00:03:13.070 --> 00:03:13.080 
eat the ground and then that's when we

00:03:13.080 --> 00:03:17.120 
eat the ground and then that's when we
will<00:03:13.350> talk<00:03:13.560> about<00:03:13.740> a<00:03:14.570> meteorite<00:03:15.570> and<00:03:16.170> not<00:03:16.770> only

00:03:17.120 --> 00:03:17.130 
will talk about a meteorite and not only

00:03:17.130 --> 00:03:19.190 
will talk about a meteorite and not only
a<00:03:17.160> meteor<00:03:17.520> so<00:03:18.210> mark<00:03:18.390> just<00:03:18.600> having<00:03:18.810> listened<00:03:19.080> to

a meteor so mark just having listened to

00:03:19.200 --> 00:03:20.840 
a meteor so mark just having listened to
that<00:03:19.230> clip<00:03:19.620> I<00:03:19.740> can<00:03:19.770> tell<00:03:20.100> that<00:03:20.130> you're<00:03:20.430> you're

00:05:16.800 --> 00:05:16.810 
go back down the mountain so it was

00:05:16.810 --> 00:05:18.840 
go back down the mountain so it was

pretty crazy and on that night I told
myself<00:05:19.150> whether<00:05:19.419> it<00:05:19.720> be<00:05:19.930> interesting<00:05:20.530> to<00:05:20.680> have

00:05:20.790 --> 00:05:20.800 
myself whether it be interesting to have

00:05:20.800 --> 00:05:23.790 
myself whether it be interesting to have
truly<00:05:21.729> visiting<00:05:21.970> hours<00:05:22.930> where<00:05:23.260> people<00:05:23.590> could

00:05:23.790 --> 00:05:23.800 
truly visiting hours where people could

00:05:23.800 --> 00:05:25.500 
truly visiting hours where people could
come<00:05:23.830> in<00:05:24.250> does<00:05:24.460> it<00:05:24.580> drink<00:05:24.760> it<00:05:24.880> because<00:05:25.030> if<00:05:25.360> i

00:05:25.500 --> 00:05:25.510 
come in does it drink it because if i

00:05:25.510 --> 00:05:27.030 
come in does it drink it because if i
wasn't<00:05:25.900> working<00:05:25.930> here<00:05:26.410> i<00:05:26.440> would<00:05:26.800> have<00:05:26.919> been

00:05:27.030 --> 00:05:27.040 
wasn't working here i would have been

00:05:27.040 --> 00:05:28.770 
wasn't working here i would have been
the<00:05:27.430> first<00:05:27.610> one<00:05:27.760> to<00:05:27.910> come<00:05:28.210> and<00:05:28.389> knock<00:05:28.540> at<00:05:28.690> the

00:05:28.770 --> 00:05:28.780 
the first one to come and knock at the

00:05:28.780 --> 00:05:30.540 
the first one to come and knock at the
door<00:05:28.960> and<00:05:29.050> say<00:05:29.320> i<00:05:29.530> want<00:05:29.919> to<00:05:30.190> look<00:05:30.310> at<00:05:30.430> the

00:05:30.540 --> 00:05:30.550 
door and say i want to look at the

00:05:30.550 --> 00:05:34.140 
door and say i want to look at the
telescope<00:05:31.030> so<00:05:31.890> eventually<00:05:32.890> i<00:05:33.190> had<00:05:33.760> the<00:05:34.000> idea

00:05:34.140 --> 00:05:34.150 
telescope so eventually i had the idea

00:05:34.150 --> 00:05:36.420 
telescope so eventually i had the idea
of<00:05:34.450> creating<00:05:35.050> a<00:05:35.140> visitor<00:05:35.560> center<00:05:35.919> which<00:05:36.400> is

00:05:36.420 --> 00:05:36.430 
of creating a visitor center which is

00:05:36.430 --> 00:05:38.969 
of creating a visitor center which is
now<00:05:36.700> called<00:05:36.729> the<00:05:37.090> astrolabe<00:05:37.630> and<00:05:37.979> there's

00:05:38.969 --> 00:05:38.979 
now called the astrolabe and there's

00:05:38.979 --> 00:05:41.400 
now called the astrolabe and there's
over<00:05:39.340> half<00:05:40.060> a<00:05:40.330> million<00:05:40.540> people<00:05:40.690> who<00:05:41.140> came<00:05:41.350> to

00:05:41.400 --> 00:05:41.410 
over half a million people who came to

00:05:41.410 --> 00:05:43.350 
over half a million people who came to
