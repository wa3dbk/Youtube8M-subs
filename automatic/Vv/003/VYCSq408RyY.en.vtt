00:00:09.720 --> 00:00:10.600
 How are you? 

00:00:10.640 --> 00:00:11.160
 Hello there 

00:00:11.200 --> 00:00:11.800
 Are you ok? 

00:00:11.840 --> 00:00:13.000
 Good, How about you? 

00:00:13.120 --> 00:00:14.680
 I am fine too 

00:00:14.720 --> 00:00:15.560
 where do you want to go? 

00:00:15.600 --> 00:00:18.440
 Please take me to the Champs Elysees 

00:00:18.480 --> 00:00:19.560
 Hello Andrea Andrea? 

00:00:19.600 --> 00:00:21.440
 Someone is talking to me, hello Andrea 

00:00:21.480 --> 00:00:23.400
 is it? Excuse me, who are you? 

00:00:23.440 --> 00:00:24.320
 Are you ok? 

00:00:24.360 --> 00:00:25.640
 well 

00:00:25.680 --> 00:00:26.840
 I forgot to introduce you to my car. 

00:00:26.880 --> 00:00:29.120
 Sorry, I think it should be your wife talking in the back of the car. 

00:00:29.200 --> 00:00:30.760
 no no 

00:00:30.800 --> 00:00:32.280
 We are like a couple 

00:00:32.360 --> 00:00:34.720
 I understand who is in charge now. 

00:00:34.760 --> 00:00:36.360
 Who has the final say? 

00:00:36.400 --> 00:00:39.560
 You think you and Novak Djokovic 

00:00:39.600 --> 00:00:41.200
 Do you both have the same sense of humor? 

00:00:41.280 --> 00:00:42.800
 I don't know at all. 

00:00:42.840 --> 00:00:44.000
 He never laughs when I tell a joke. 

00:00:44.080 --> 00:00:46.440
 Maybe he doesn't want to show me very interesting 

00:00:46.480 --> 00:00:47.720
 But you have to know a little 

00:00:47.760 --> 00:00:49.880
 For yourself, you will always be the most interesting person. 

00:00:49.920 --> 00:00:51.800
 Otherwise you won't say these jokes 

00:00:51.880 --> 00:00:54.200
 right? Because you think these jokes are very interesting. 

00:00:54.240 --> 00:00:55.840
 Then no one laughs, you will think 

00:00:55.880 --> 00:00:57.280
 How are these people so stupid? 

00:00:57.320 --> 00:00:59.000
 They can't fully understand my humor 

00:00:59.040 --> 00:01:01.440
 Finally, you became the stupidest person. 

00:01:01.480 --> 00:01:02.320
 Not fun at all 

00:01:02.400 --> 00:01:03.840
 I fully understand 

00:01:04.600 --> 00:01:06.280
 I still think 

00:01:06.320 --> 00:01:08.960
 You hid your wife in the back of the car without me swearing 

00:01:09.000 --> 00:01:11.600
 I will get off the bus after you park. 

00:01:11.800 --> 00:01:13.680
 If you want to form a band 

00:01:13.720 --> 00:01:15.640
 In the tennis player 

00:01:15.680 --> 00:01:16.960
 Regardless of men and women 

00:01:17.000 --> 00:01:18.240
 Who would you choose as a band member? 

00:01:18.280 --> 00:01:19.440
 What kind of instrument do you want them to play? 

00:01:19.480 --> 00:01:20.800
 I will definitely choose 

00:01:20.840 --> 00:01:22.680
 Serena Williams as lead singer 

00:01:22.720 --> 00:01:25.400
 Because I think she is a great singer 

00:01:25.440 --> 00:01:28.120
 I heard that she also likes to sing karaoke. 

00:01:28.160 --> 00:01:29.640
 She will be a very good lead singer. 

00:01:29.680 --> 00:01:32.400
 Of course, I will choose myself as a drummer. 

00:01:32.800 --> 00:01:34.920
 Anna Ivanovic is very beautiful 

00:01:34.960 --> 00:01:36.560
 So she can be a bass player 

00:01:36.600 --> 00:01:39.000
 Guitarists are always crazy people 

00:01:39.040 --> 00:01:40.320
 The right person is 

00:01:40.360 --> 00:01:41.840
 Yulia Pudingseva 

00:01:41.880 --> 00:01:43.120
 Her madness is more positive 

00:01:43.160 --> 00:01:45.920
 So she can be a guitarist 

00:01:46.160 --> 00:01:47.600
 Before you get off the bus 

00:01:47.640 --> 00:01:48.640
 can you give me a hug? can 

00:01:49.720 --> 00:01:50.920
 a gentle hug 

00:01:50.960 --> 00:01:52.360
 awesome 

00:01:52.400 --> 00:01:53.560
 This hug feels very good 

00:01:53.600 --> 00:01:54.960
 Thank you very much. 

00:01:55.000 --> 00:01:56.440
 How about feeling like a kiss? 

00:01:56.480 --> 00:01:58.560
 It feels so wonderful 

00:01:58.600 --> 00:01:59.720
 Ok, I am very happy.
