00:01:12.060 --> 00:01:12.070 
going to see how strong Gorilla Glass 3

00:01:12.070 --> 00:01:15.789 
going to see how strong Gorilla Glass 3
really<00:01:13.070> is<00:01:13.250> because<00:01:13.520> first<00:01:14.330> so<00:01:15.020> far<00:01:15.350> and<00:01:15.649> my

00:01:17.710 --> 00:01:17.720 
experiences doing this knife scratch

00:01:17.720 --> 00:01:20.469 
experiences doing this knife scratch
test<00:01:18.170> and<00:01:18.439> this<00:01:18.560> five<00:01:18.860> foot<00:01:19.130> drop<00:01:19.340> test<00:01:20.240> I'm

00:01:20.469 --> 00:01:20.479 
test and this five foot drop test I'm

00:01:20.479 --> 00:01:23.740

just<00:01:20.810> surprised<00:01:21.229> at<00:01:21.789> how<00:01:22.789> easily<00:01:23.149> this<00:01:23.509> thing

00:01:23.740 --> 00:01:23.750 
just surprised at how easily this thing

00:01:23.750 --> 00:01:29.710 
just surprised at how easily this thing
is<00:01:23.929> getting<00:01:24.200> destroyed<00:01:26.110> but<00:01:27.110> you<00:01:27.440> know<00:01:28.720> maybe

00:01:29.710 --> 00:01:29.720 
is getting destroyed but you know maybe

00:01:29.720 --> 00:01:33.580 
is getting destroyed but you know maybe
this<00:01:30.140> glass<00:01:31.130> really<00:01:31.549> is<00:01:31.729> resistant<00:01:32.420> so<00:01:32.630> I've

00:01:33.580 --> 00:01:33.590 
this glass really is resistant so I've

00:01:33.590 --> 00:01:44.529 
this glass really is resistant so I've
got<00:01:33.799> my<00:01:33.830> hammer<00:01:34.190> let's<00:01:35.179> do<00:01:35.390> it<00:01:35.420> oh<00:01:43.209> I<00:01:44.209> heard

00:01:44.529 --> 00:01:44.539 
got my hammer let's do it oh I heard

00:01:44.539 --> 00:02:12.360 
got my hammer let's do it oh I heard
something<00:01:44.929> I<00:02:01.450> think<00:02:02.450> I<00:02:02.539> got<00:02:02.719> a<00:02:02.750> text<00:02:03.140> message

00:02:12.360 --> 00:02:12.370 

00:02:12.370 --> 00:02:15.940 

so<00:02:13.370> I<00:02:13.400> could<00:02:13.850> tell<00:02:14.239> that<00:02:14.600> the<00:02:14.930> screen<00:02:15.739> is

00:02:15.940 --> 00:02:15.950 
so I could tell that the screen is

00:02:15.950 --> 00:02:18.009 
so I could tell that the screen is
actually<00:02:16.280> really<00:02:16.760> strong<00:02:17.180> because<00:02:17.810> i'm<00:02:17.989> using

00:02:18.009 --> 00:02:18.019 
actually really strong because i'm using

00:02:18.019 --> 00:02:21.940 
actually really strong because i'm using
pretty<00:02:18.859> much<00:02:19.010> full<00:02:19.250> force<00:02:19.780> um<00:02:20.780> like<00:02:21.440> a<00:02:21.650> regular

00:02:21.940 --> 00:02:21.950 
pretty much full force um like a regular

00:02:21.950 --> 00:02:27.150 
pretty much full force um like a regular
just<00:02:22.519> kind<00:02:22.760> of<00:02:22.820> drop<00:02:23.209> you<00:02:23.390> know<00:02:23.510> hold<00:02:24.230> on<00:02:24.350> I

00:02:27.150 --> 00:02:27.160 

00:02:27.160 --> 00:02:30.340 

mean<00:02:28.160> it's<00:02:28.400> still<00:02:28.489> causing<00:02:29.140> scratches<00:02:30.140> other

00:02:30.340 --> 00:02:30.350 
mean it's still causing scratches other

00:02:30.350 --> 00:02:33.280 
mean it's still causing scratches other
not<00:02:30.590> as<00:02:30.799> intense<00:02:31.579> and<00:02:31.910> visible<00:02:32.420> as<00:02:32.630> like<00:02:33.140> the

00:02:33.280 --> 00:02:33.290 
not as intense and visible as like the

00:02:33.290 --> 00:02:36.849 
not as intense and visible as like the
iPhone<00:02:33.680> scratches<00:02:34.220> but<00:02:34.850> still<00:02:35.239> on<00:02:35.709> you<00:02:36.709> could

00:02:36.849 --> 00:02:36.859 
iPhone scratches but still on you could

00:02:36.859 --> 00:02:38.710 
iPhone scratches but still on you could
still<00:02:37.160> see<00:02:37.340> the<00:02:37.459> scratches<00:02:37.760> are<00:02:38.120> very<00:02:38.390> light

00:02:38.710 --> 00:02:38.720 
still see the scratches are very light

00:02:38.720 --> 00:02:42.130 
still see the scratches are very light
but<00:02:38.989> they're<00:02:39.709> very<00:02:39.739> delicate<00:02:40.579> so<00:02:40.819> I<00:02:41.000> like<00:02:41.930> the

00:02:42.130 --> 00:02:42.140 
but they're very delicate so I like the

00:02:42.140 --> 00:02:44.920 
but they're very delicate so I like the
five<00:02:42.350> foot<00:02:42.590> drop<00:02:42.620> test<00:02:43.160> you<00:02:43.400> know<00:02:43.600> even<00:02:44.600> though

00:02:44.920 --> 00:02:44.930 
five foot drop test you know even though

00:02:44.930 --> 00:02:48.039 
five foot drop test you know even though
it<00:02:45.079> was<00:02:45.200> very<00:02:45.440> it<00:02:45.769> was<00:02:45.859> not<00:02:46.220> high<00:02:46.519> it<00:02:47.060> was<00:02:47.660> there

00:02:48.039 --> 00:02:48.049 
it was very it was not high it was there

00:02:48.049 --> 00:02:49.990 
it was very it was not high it was there
just<00:02:48.260> small<00:02:48.560> marks<00:02:48.920> all<00:02:49.160> over<00:02:49.190> though<00:02:49.670> it

00:02:49.990 --> 00:02:50.000 
just small marks all over though it

00:02:50.000 --> 00:02:51.550 
just small marks all over though it
wasn't<00:02:50.180> really<00:02:50.450> intense<00:02:50.810> or<00:02:50.989> anything<00:02:51.350> I

00:02:51.550 --> 00:02:51.560 
wasn't really intense or anything I

00:02:51.560 --> 00:02:53.470 
wasn't really intense or anything I
really<00:02:52.280> know<00:02:52.430> what<00:02:52.459> I'm<00:02:52.579> trying<00:02:52.850> to<00:02:52.880> say<00:02:52.940> but<00:02:53.090> i

00:02:53.470 --> 00:02:53.480 
really know what I'm trying to say but i

00:02:53.480 --> 00:02:57.099 
really know what I'm trying to say but i
think<00:02:53.959> that<00:02:54.170> the<00:02:54.829> galaxy<00:02:55.400> s4<00:02:55.850> the<00:02:56.480> screen<00:02:56.900> is

00:02:57.099 --> 00:02:57.109 
think that the galaxy s4 the screen is

00:02:57.109 --> 00:03:00.729 
think that the galaxy s4 the screen is
stronger<00:02:57.980> in<00:02:58.010> like<00:02:58.489> certain<00:02:58.940> situations<00:02:59.739> but

00:03:00.729 --> 00:03:00.739 
stronger in like certain situations but

00:03:00.739 --> 00:03:10.060 
stronger in like certain situations but
let's<00:03:01.459> just<00:03:01.760> keep<00:03:01.940> doing<00:03:02.239> this<00:03:02.330> a<00:03:02.390> little<00:03:02.599> more

00:03:10.060 --> 00:03:10.070
