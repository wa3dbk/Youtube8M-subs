00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.910
 doubly as we walk good as you see 

00:00:02.780 --> 00:00:08.670
 here I bring you a small video of 

00:00:05.910 --> 00:00:11.160
 new cable that I just ordered that 

00:00:08.670 --> 00:00:13.360
 try the double zero as you see before 

00:00:11.160 --> 00:00:17.040
 was wearing 

00:00:13.360 --> 00:00:17.040
 the new concept cable 

00:00:17.140 --> 00:00:23.369
 the cable 4 and set a gauge of 4 

00:00:21.250 --> 00:00:25.989
 and caliber 0 

00:00:23.369 --> 00:00:30.609
 the only difference that he's using 

00:00:25.989 --> 00:00:34.410
 the cis and that is the aluminum sheath of the 

00:00:30.609 --> 00:00:38.230
 approximately copper is useful for 

00:00:34.410 --> 00:00:40.570
 250 amps and then from this same brand 

00:00:38.230 --> 00:00:45.699
 of this same caliber 

00:00:40.570 --> 00:00:49.629
 but in were this 100% pure copper this 

00:00:45.699 --> 00:00:52.650
 it's giving you about 350 amps are 

00:00:49.629 --> 00:00:55.650
 like 100 more pÃ©rez 

00:00:52.650 --> 00:01:00.030
 and nothing more for the simple fact that it is 

00:00:55.650 --> 00:01:03.290
 pure poor really is more effective more 

00:01:00.030 --> 00:01:07.300
 fast carries the energy 

00:01:03.290 --> 00:01:10.950
 compared to this is cheaper almost 

00:01:07.300 --> 00:01:13.490
 approximately half the price 

00:01:10.950 --> 00:01:16.670
 but as you see 

00:01:13.490 --> 00:01:20.680
 it worked for me and I was 

00:01:16.670 --> 00:01:20.680
 sometimes being very happy with this 

00:01:21.210 --> 00:01:29.820
 the difference between the the sisej that is 

00:01:25.590 --> 00:01:33.479
 the cole with the copper the cable 

00:01:29.820 --> 00:01:36.330
 aluminum this easy you can recognize 

00:01:33.479 --> 00:01:40.390
 by its glows this silver color 

00:01:36.330 --> 00:01:44.070
 if the camera has been focused 

00:01:40.390 --> 00:01:47.740
 there is every one who cut it 

00:01:44.070 --> 00:01:49.810
 it is a bit silver when cut 

00:01:47.740 --> 00:01:53.530
 the color of aluminum because it was not 

00:01:49.810 --> 00:01:56.680
 bathed in a pure copper and another form of 

00:01:53.530 --> 00:02:00.820
 know what kind of cable you have is because 

00:01:56.680 --> 00:02:04.680
 the aluminum is very light and the 

00:02:00.820 --> 00:02:09.310
 copper weighs almost double so 

00:02:04.680 --> 00:02:11.560
 more or less have an idea like 

00:02:09.310 --> 00:02:13.630
 how to know what type of cable you have or 

00:02:11.560 --> 00:02:17.520
 what kind of cable are you selling 

00:02:13.630 --> 00:02:22.230
 good but then as you see here we have the 

00:02:17.520 --> 00:02:22.230
 cable that is 

00:02:23.440 --> 00:02:26.440
 well 

00:02:27.319 --> 00:02:32.970
 a little 

00:02:29.569 --> 00:02:36.870
 It's left, I would say 

00:02:32.970 --> 00:02:39.650
 a bit exaggerated on the outside inside 

00:02:36.870 --> 00:02:39.650
 Not that much 

00:02:40.240 --> 00:02:43.590
 a little thicker 

00:02:47.120 --> 00:02:52.690
 the 0 cable 

00:02:49.440 --> 00:02:58.980
 of the new concept 

00:02:52.690 --> 00:02:58.980
 it's something something the difference 

00:02:59.460 --> 00:03:04.200
 and in the colors also as I was 

00:03:01.530 --> 00:03:09.530
 explaining one is more silver and 

00:03:04.200 --> 00:03:09.530
 the other one is more orange they serve 

00:03:09.660 --> 00:03:17.000
 it's not pure copper and the other one is 

00:03:13.940 --> 00:03:19.270
 aluminum accompanied in copper 

00:03:17.000 --> 00:03:22.190
 and the difference in sizes, yes, 

00:03:19.270 --> 00:03:24.940
 Well I liked that it comes a lot 

00:03:22.190 --> 00:03:28.200
 reinforced outside 

00:03:24.940 --> 00:03:31.050
 but it comes with the caliber 

00:03:28.200 --> 00:03:34.810
 what is the caliber, this one that should 

00:03:31.050 --> 00:03:38.830
 to be double zero do not lie in it 

00:03:34.810 --> 00:03:41.720
 to the extent there they tell you more or less 

00:03:38.830 --> 00:03:44.430
 that is 

00:03:41.720 --> 00:03:47.430
 circumference has the cable before 

00:03:44.430 --> 00:03:49.580
 buy it and then also in this brand 

00:03:47.430 --> 00:03:51.620
 It is also quite 

00:03:49.580 --> 00:03:53.750
 quite 

00:03:51.620 --> 00:03:56.480
 true so what they sell you 

00:03:53.750 --> 00:03:59.640
 although they come well 

00:03:56.480 --> 00:04:02.790
 This is the cheapest of the 

00:03:59.640 --> 00:04:04.410
 the aluminum and the other one that is this I do not 

00:04:02.790 --> 00:04:05.790
 I agree with what that type of cable is called 

00:04:04.410 --> 00:04:10.500
 with light its colors 

00:04:05.790 --> 00:04:16.260
 something like this is this to 349 in something like that the 

00:04:10.500 --> 00:04:19.000
 foot with the cable foot is this one quite 

00:04:16.260 --> 00:04:20.810
 good price these modes 

00:04:19.000 --> 00:04:22.520
 young 

00:04:20.810 --> 00:04:24.680
 we are going to 

00:04:22.520 --> 00:04:26.000
 start installing this cable very soon 

00:04:24.680 --> 00:04:29.930
 we're going to replace everything we have 

00:04:26.000 --> 00:04:31.670
 of the caliber 0 we are going to put this cable 

00:04:29.930 --> 00:04:35.030
 to see this 

00:04:31.670 --> 00:04:38.450
 how much that works for me because 

00:04:35.030 --> 00:04:41.660
 as you see later I want to put a 

00:04:38.450 --> 00:04:44.690
 second bass amplifier which is the 

00:04:41.660 --> 00:04:47.870
 another kicker and we're just going to order 

00:04:44.690 --> 00:04:49.860
 also another speaker of it and do 

00:04:47.870 --> 00:04:53.520
 a drawer 

00:04:49.860 --> 00:04:55.960
 for the two speakers 15 so be 

00:04:53.520 --> 00:05:00.090
 attentive and we are going to 

00:04:55.960 --> 00:05:00.090
 to see how the next project goes
