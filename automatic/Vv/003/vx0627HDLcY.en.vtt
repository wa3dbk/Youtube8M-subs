00:00:04.580 --> 00:00:09.630
 hello here is the bluetooth bike sensor 

00:00:07.710 --> 00:00:12.510
 that allows you to measure in real time 

00:00:09.630 --> 00:00:14.519
 and on smartphone your settings of 

00:00:12.510 --> 00:00:18.970
 races such as cadence and the 

00:00:14.519 --> 00:00:20.830
 speed then the pack contains 

00:00:18.970 --> 00:00:23.349
 the actual sensor with a 

00:00:20.830 --> 00:00:26.919
 cadence detector and a detector of 

00:00:23.349 --> 00:00:30.200
 speed the installation kit on the 

00:00:26.919 --> 00:00:32.740
 frame of the bike and the two magnets 

00:00:30.200 --> 00:00:32.740
 Related 

00:00:33.530 --> 00:00:39.769
 now let's see how to install the 

00:00:35.930 --> 00:00:43.940
 sensor on the bike first step 

00:00:39.769 --> 00:00:49.670
 is to remove the pedal using 

00:00:43.940 --> 00:00:50.839
 of a key place the pedal dead into 

00:00:49.670 --> 00:01:02.379
 keeping the thick part towards 

00:00:50.839 --> 00:01:02.379
 inside then take the sensor 

00:01:03.250 --> 00:01:07.899
 donned the two necklaces qu'olson 

00:01:08.679 --> 00:01:17.179
 position the sensor on the frame 

00:01:13.729 --> 00:01:24.860
 being careful to keep the logo 

00:01:17.179 --> 00:01:27.789
 highways here to the outside close 

00:01:24.860 --> 00:01:27.789
 the two necklaces 

00:01:31.640 --> 00:01:37.950
 would not be positioned now the 

00:01:36.179 --> 00:01:41.159
 sensor so that the magnet passes 

00:01:37.950 --> 00:01:49.009
 in front of the cadence detector at each 

00:01:41.159 --> 00:01:49.009
 tight final rotation 

00:01:52.340 --> 00:01:56.649
 firmly pick the consonants 

00:01:58.119 --> 00:02:08.149
 cut off the ends then welcome 

00:02:01.969 --> 00:02:13.400
 of agathe hours and finally hang the 

00:02:08.149 --> 00:02:16.269
 rubber by making it go through 

00:02:13.400 --> 00:02:16.269
 back to front 

00:02:27.370 --> 00:02:33.670
 unscrewed then screwed up the small magnet 

00:02:30.269 --> 00:02:35.319
 on the spoke of the rear wheel so 

00:02:33.670 --> 00:02:38.670
 that they pass in front of the detector of 

00:02:35.319 --> 00:02:38.670
 speed with each rotation of the wheels 

00:02:51.510 --> 00:03:01.000
 tilt the sensor so that it 

00:02:55.629 --> 00:03:06.459
 passes a few millimeters the leman to 

00:03:01.000 --> 00:03:09.879
 every pedal rotation by checking 

00:03:06.459 --> 00:03:12.060
 although the dead yesterday vast well 

00:03:09.879 --> 00:03:16.590
 always to see the speed detector 

00:03:12.060 --> 00:03:16.590
 finally screw the pedal
