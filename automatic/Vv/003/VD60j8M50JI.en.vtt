device construction a out of ten is

00:03:14.730 --> 00:03:16.580 
device construction a out of ten is
perhaps<00:03:14.940> a<00:03:15.240> little<00:03:15.270> bit<00:03:15.510> lightweight<00:03:16.020> but<00:03:16.350> I

00:03:16.580 --> 00:03:16.590 
perhaps a little bit lightweight but I

00:03:16.590 --> 00:03:18.380 
perhaps a little bit lightweight but I
think<00:03:17.310> actually<00:03:17.459> most<00:03:17.820> users<00:03:18.090> are<00:03:18.180> going<00:03:18.300> to

00:03:18.380 --> 00:03:18.390 
think actually most users are going to

00:03:18.390 --> 00:03:18.949 
think actually most users are going to
like<00:03:18.540> that

00:03:18.949 --> 00:03:18.959 
like that

00:03:18.959 --> 00:03:22.280 
like that
so<00:03:19.470> it's<00:03:19.590> hardly<00:03:19.800> a<00:03:19.920> drawback<00:03:20.480> and<00:03:21.480> as<00:03:21.630> as<00:03:22.050> well

00:03:22.280 --> 00:03:22.290 
so it's hardly a drawback and as as well

00:03:22.290 --> 00:03:24.229 
so it's hardly a drawback and as as well
put<00:03:22.530> together<00:03:22.680> it's<00:03:23.220> quite<00:03:23.400> solid<00:03:23.700> you're<00:03:24.090> not

00:03:24.229 --> 00:03:24.239 
put together it's quite solid you're not

00:03:24.239 --> 00:03:27.410 
put together it's quite solid you're not
gonna<00:03:24.420> squash<00:03:24.780> it<00:03:25.310> overall<00:03:26.370> seven<00:03:26.970> out<00:03:27.090> of<00:03:27.120> ten

00:03:27.410 --> 00:03:27.420 
gonna squash it overall seven out of ten

00:03:27.420 --> 00:03:31.640 
gonna squash it overall seven out of ten

00:03:35.000 --> 00:03:35.010 
players really what stops it scoring

00:03:35.010 --> 00:03:37.640
