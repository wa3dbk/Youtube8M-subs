Steve if you like to knit like I do

00:00:06.470 --> 00:00:08.919 
Steve if you like to knit like I do
you'll<00:00:07.129> know<00:00:07.339> that<00:00:07.370> you<00:00:08.029> need<00:00:08.240> to<00:00:08.360> wind<00:00:08.660> up

00:00:08.919 --> 00:00:08.929 
you'll know that you need to wind up

00:00:08.929 --> 00:00:11.289 
you'll know that you need to wind up
balls<00:00:09.290> of<00:00:09.620> yarn<00:00:10.070> and<00:00:10.400> for<00:00:10.759> that<00:00:10.910> you<00:00:11.120> need<00:00:11.269> a

00:00:11.289 --> 00:00:11.299 
balls of yarn and for that you need a

00:00:11.299 --> 00:00:14.020 
balls of yarn and for that you need a
yarn<00:00:11.780> Swift<00:00:12.170> what<00:00:12.740> is<00:00:12.950> a<00:00:13.280> yarn<00:00:13.759> Swift

00:00:14.020 --> 00:00:14.030 
yarn Swift what is a yarn Swift

00:00:14.030 --> 00:00:16.840 
yarn Swift what is a yarn Swift
sometimes<00:00:14.870> you<00:00:14.990> buy<00:00:15.169> yarn<00:00:15.769> and<00:00:16.160> it<00:00:16.250> comes<00:00:16.490> in<00:00:16.700> a

00:00:16.840 --> 00:00:16.850 
sometimes you buy yarn and it comes in a

00:00:16.850 --> 00:00:19.480 
sometimes you buy yarn and it comes in a
shank<00:00:17.420> like<00:00:17.870> this<00:00:18.260> it's<00:00:18.500> not<00:00:18.710> a<00:00:18.770> ball<00:00:19.100> of<00:00:19.310> yarn

00:00:19.480 --> 00:00:19.490 
shank like this it's not a ball of yarn

00:00:19.490 --> 00:00:21.940 
shank like this it's not a ball of yarn
and<00:00:19.790> you<00:00:19.910> need<00:00:20.090> to<00:00:20.360> wind<00:00:20.810> it<00:00:21.020> into<00:00:21.350> a<00:00:21.380> ball<00:00:21.680> okay

00:00:21.940 --> 00:00:21.950 
and you need to wind it into a ball okay

00:00:21.950 --> 00:00:23.380 
and you need to wind it into a ball okay
so<00:00:22.100> here's<00:00:22.430> what<00:00:22.580> it<00:00:22.670> looks<00:00:22.850> like<00:00:23.000> when<00:00:23.240> it's

00:00:23.380 --> 00:00:23.390 
so here's what it looks like when it's

00:00:23.390 --> 00:00:26.650 
so here's what it looks like when it's
all<00:00:23.770> untwisted<00:00:24.770> and<00:00:25.010> so<00:00:25.340> she<00:00:25.430> set<00:00:25.880> these<00:00:26.120> pegs

00:00:26.650 --> 00:00:26.660 
all untwisted and so she set these pegs

00:00:26.660 --> 00:00:30.640 
all untwisted and so she set these pegs
where<00:00:27.650> it<00:00:28.490> should<00:00:28.700> go<00:00:28.730> go<00:00:29.000> ahead<00:00:29.140> so<00:00:30.140> she's

00:00:30.640 --> 00:00:30.650 
where it should go go ahead so she's

00:00:30.650 --> 00:00:33.160 
where it should go go ahead so she's
gonna<00:00:30.740> wrap<00:00:30.950> it<00:00:30.980> around<00:00:31.220> like<00:00:31.790> that<00:00:32.210> and<00:00:32.689> then

00:00:33.160 --> 00:00:33.170 
gonna wrap it around like that and then

00:00:33.170 --> 00:00:35.579 
gonna wrap it around like that and then
she<00:00:33.440> can<00:00:33.559> just<00:00:33.739> grab<00:00:33.890> one<00:00:34.190> end<00:00:34.579> and<00:00:34.940> start

00:00:35.579 --> 00:00:35.589 
she can just grab one end and start

00:00:35.589 --> 00:00:43.569 
she can just grab one end and start
winding<00:00:41.800> but<00:00:42.800> the<00:00:42.920> nice<00:00:43.070> thing<00:00:43.100> about<00:00:43.309> this

00:00:43.569 --> 00:00:43.579 
winding but the nice thing about this

00:00:43.579 --> 00:00:46.239 
winding but the nice thing about this
yarn<00:00:43.969> Swift<00:00:44.179> is<00:00:44.600> that<00:00:44.929> it's<00:00:45.199> made<00:00:45.530> to<00:00:45.559> store

00:00:46.239 --> 00:00:46.249 
yarn Swift is that it's made to store

00:00:46.249 --> 00:00:53.410 
yarn Swift is that it's made to store
and<00:00:46.609> so<00:00:47.089> it<00:00:47.359> all<00:00:47.600> collapses<00:00:48.499> down<00:00:51.609> okay<00:00:52.609> so<00:00:53.149> now

00:00:53.410 --> 00:00:53.420 
and so it all collapses down okay so now

00:00:53.420 --> 00:00:56.649 
and so it all collapses down okay so now
you<00:00:53.480> just<00:00:54.050> need<00:00:54.170> to<00:00:54.319> make<00:00:54.589> some<00:00:54.980> sort<00:00:55.640> of<00:00:55.699> a<00:00:55.850> bag

00:00:56.649 --> 00:00:56.659 
you just need to make some sort of a bag

00:00:56.659 --> 00:01:00.910 
you just need to make some sort of a bag
or<00:00:56.989> something<00:00:57.019> to<00:00:57.530> hold<00:00:57.739> it<00:00:57.859> up<00:00:59.440> I'm<00:01:00.440> starting

00:01:00.910 --> 00:01:00.920

the 24 inch boards and one of the 30

00:01:19.910 --> 00:01:21.910 
the 24 inch boards and one of the 30
inch<00:01:20.120> boards<00:01:20.540> this<00:01:20.990> is<00:01:21.170> what's<00:01:21.380> going<00:01:21.590> to<00:01:21.680> make

00:01:21.910 --> 00:01:21.920 
inch boards this is what's going to make

00:01:21.920 --> 00:01:25.840 
inch boards this is what's going to make
the<00:01:22.190> yarn<00:01:22.760> Swift<00:01:23.090> spin<00:01:24.020> it's<00:01:24.500> a<00:01:24.710> hose<00:01:25.130> coupling

00:01:25.840 --> 00:01:25.850 
the yarn Swift spin it's a hose coupling

00:01:25.850 --> 00:01:27.940 
the yarn Swift spin it's a hose coupling
for<00:01:26.150> a<00:01:26.200> garden<00:01:27.200> hose<00:01:27.380> you<00:01:27.530> can<00:01:27.650> pick<00:01:27.770> these<00:01:27.890> up

00:01:27.940 --> 00:01:27.950 
for a garden hose you can pick these up

00:01:27.950 --> 00:01:30.250 
for a garden hose you can pick these up
in<00:01:28.370> the<00:01:28.550> plumbing<00:01:29.060> department<00:01:29.210> of<00:01:29.810> your

00:01:30.250 --> 00:01:30.260 
in the plumbing department of your

00:01:30.260 --> 00:01:32.830 
in the plumbing department of your
hardware<00:01:30.740> store<00:01:30.800> so<00:01:31.670> that<00:01:31.850> coupling<00:01:32.150> will<00:01:32.540> fit

00:01:32.830 --> 00:01:32.840 
hardware store so that coupling will fit

00:01:32.840 --> 00:01:35.650 
hardware store so that coupling will fit
into<00:01:33.080> those<00:01:33.440> shallow<00:01:33.980> holes<00:01:34.460> I<00:01:34.790> made<00:01:35.090> the<00:01:35.480> only

00:01:35.650 --> 00:01:35.660 
into those shallow holes I made the only

00:01:35.660 --> 00:01:37.450 
into those shallow holes I made the only
problem<00:01:36.140> is<00:01:36.260> with<00:01:36.470> these<00:01:36.620> little<00:01:36.830> ridges<00:01:37.310> on

00:01:37.450 --> 00:01:37.460 
problem is with these little ridges on

00:01:37.460 --> 00:01:39.820 
problem is with these little ridges on
there<00:01:37.790> it's<00:01:37.970> a<00:01:38.120> little<00:01:38.330> bit<00:01:38.600> too<00:01:38.810> big<00:01:39.200> so<00:01:39.470> I'm

00:01:39.820 --> 00:01:39.830 
there it's a little bit too big so I'm

00:01:39.830 --> 00:01:41.680 
there it's a little bit too big so I'm
just<00:01:40.010> sanding<00:01:40.490> out<00:01:40.610> the<00:01:40.790> insides<00:01:41.300> of<00:01:41.510> those

00:01:41.680 --> 00:01:41.690 
just sanding out the insides of those

00:01:41.690 --> 00:01:43.750 
just sanding out the insides of those
holes<00:01:41.990> to<00:01:42.230> make<00:01:42.350> a<00:01:42.380> little<00:01:42.590> bigger<00:01:42.830> that's<00:01:43.610> a

00:01:43.750 --> 00:01:43.760 
holes to make a little bigger that's a

00:01:43.760 --> 00:01:46.420 
holes to make a little bigger that's a
pretty<00:01:43.970> tight<00:01:44.210> fit<00:01:44.530> now<00:01:45.530> I've<00:01:45.680> made<00:01:45.890> two<00:01:46.190> inch

00:01:46.420 --> 00:01:46.430 
pretty tight fit now I've made two inch

00:01:46.430 --> 00:01:49.390 
pretty tight fit now I've made two inch
marks<00:01:47.060> in<00:01:47.270> the<00:01:47.510> center<00:01:48.020> of<00:01:48.230> each<00:01:48.680> of<00:01:48.740> the<00:01:49.190> other

00:01:49.390 --> 00:01:49.400 
marks in the center of each of the other

00:01:49.400 --> 00:01:52.360 
marks in the center of each of the other
two<00:01:49.850> boards<00:01:50.300> and<00:01:50.480> I'll<00:01:50.870> cut<00:01:51.410> out<00:01:51.440> this<00:01:51.770> notch

00:01:52.360 --> 00:01:52.370 
two boards and I'll cut out this notch

00:01:52.370 --> 00:02:06.609 
two boards and I'll cut out this notch
on<00:01:52.730> my<00:01:52.820> table<00:01:53.420> saw

00:02:06.609 --> 00:02:06.619 

00:02:06.619 --> 00:02:09.130 

now<00:02:07.579> I<00:02:07.609> just<00:02:07.729> need<00:02:07.969> to<00:02:08.119> drill<00:02:08.390> a<00:02:08.539> quarter<00:02:08.869> inch

00:02:09.130 --> 00:02:09.140 
now I just need to drill a quarter inch

00:02:09.140 --> 00:02:20.290 
now I just need to drill a quarter inch
hole<00:02:09.229> through<00:02:09.769> each<00:02:09.979> of<00:02:10.369> the<00:02:10.940> boards<00:02:18.819> so<00:02:19.819> this

00:02:20.290 --> 00:02:20.300 
hole through each of the boards so this

00:02:20.300 --> 00:02:23.229 
hole through each of the boards so this
is<00:02:20.510> going<00:02:20.750> to<00:02:20.840> be<00:02:20.959> the<00:02:21.319> top<00:02:21.860> part<00:02:22.430> of<00:02:22.670> the<00:02:22.819> swift

00:02:23.229 --> 00:02:23.239 
is going to be the top part of the swift

00:02:23.239 --> 00:02:26.589 
is going to be the top part of the swift
and<00:02:23.540> it'll<00:02:24.230> fit<00:02:24.440> together<00:02:24.799> like<00:02:25.760> that<00:02:25.790> there's

00:02:26.589 --> 00:02:26.599 
and it'll fit together like that there's

00:02:26.599 --> 00:02:27.940 
and it'll fit together like that there's
not<00:02:26.780> much<00:02:26.930> more<00:02:27.140> I<00:02:27.170> need<00:02:27.290> to<00:02:27.470> do<00:02:27.590> with<00:02:27.739> this

00:02:27.940 --> 00:02:27.950 
not much more I need to do with this

00:02:27.950 --> 00:02:30.610 
not much more I need to do with this
other<00:02:28.220> than<00:02:28.519> drill<00:02:28.970> holes<00:02:29.330> for<00:02:29.540> dowels<00:02:30.140> now

00:02:30.610 --> 00:02:30.620 
other than drill holes for dowels now

00:02:30.620 --> 00:02:33.550 
other than drill holes for dowels now
this<00:02:31.040> will<00:02:31.370> be<00:02:31.580> the<00:02:31.970> base<00:02:32.360> the<00:02:32.810> two<00:02:32.989> shorter

00:02:33.550 --> 00:02:33.560 
this will be the base the two shorter

00:02:33.560 --> 00:02:35.860 
this will be the base the two shorter
pieces<00:02:34.069> they'll<00:02:34.519> fit<00:02:34.730> together<00:02:35.060> like<00:02:35.120> this

00:02:35.860 --> 00:02:35.870 
pieces they'll fit together like this

00:02:35.870 --> 00:02:37.539 
pieces they'll fit together like this
but<00:02:36.200> what<00:02:36.319> I<00:02:36.349> need<00:02:36.590> to<00:02:36.709> do<00:02:36.830> with<00:02:36.980> that<00:02:37.220> is<00:02:37.430> I

00:02:37.539 --> 00:02:37.549 
but what I need to do with that is I

00:02:37.549 --> 00:02:41.500 
but what I need to do with that is I
need<00:02:37.610> to<00:02:37.730> put<00:02:38.120> feet<00:02:38.630> on<00:02:38.660> all<00:02:38.930> four<00:02:39.620> sides<00:02:40.510> so

00:02:41.500 --> 00:02:41.510 
need to put feet on all four sides so

00:02:41.510 --> 00:02:43.870 
need to put feet on all four sides so
that<00:02:41.690> I<00:02:41.720> don't<00:02:41.810> have<00:02:42.019> this<00:02:42.319> wobble<00:02:42.920> also<00:02:43.670> I

00:02:43.870 --> 00:02:43.880 
that I don't have this wobble also I

00:02:43.880 --> 00:02:46.360 
that I don't have this wobble also I
need<00:02:44.180> that<00:02:44.360> to<00:02:44.510> give<00:02:44.690> me<00:02:44.900> room<00:02:45.260> for<00:02:46.250> this

00:02:46.360 --> 00:02:46.370 
need that to give me room for this

00:02:46.370 --> 00:02:49.210 
need that to give me room for this
wingnut<00:02:47.209> that'll<00:02:47.569> go<00:02:47.660> on<00:02:47.690> the<00:02:47.930> back<00:02:48.110> so<00:02:49.010> what

00:02:49.210 --> 00:02:49.220 
wingnut that'll go on the back so what

00:02:49.220 --> 00:02:52.300 
wingnut that'll go on the back so what
I've<00:02:49.340> done<00:02:49.489> is<00:02:49.670> I<00:02:49.790> cut<00:02:50.090> thin<00:02:50.780> blocks<00:02:51.319> for<00:02:51.890> this

00:02:52.300 --> 00:02:52.310 
I've done is I cut thin blocks for this

00:02:52.310 --> 00:02:54.430 
I've done is I cut thin blocks for this
side<00:02:52.640> and<00:02:52.970> then<00:02:53.390> just<00:02:53.660> kind<00:02:53.930> of<00:02:53.989> kept<00:02:54.200> playing

00:02:54.430 --> 00:02:54.440 
side and then just kind of kept playing

00:02:54.440 --> 00:02:56.020 
side and then just kind of kept playing
with<00:02:54.590> it<00:02:54.709> until<00:02:54.950> I<00:02:55.069> got<00:02:55.280> a<00:02:55.340> block<00:02:55.640> that<00:02:55.670> would

00:02:56.020 --> 00:02:56.030 
with it until I got a block that would

00:02:56.030 --> 00:02:59.680 
with it until I got a block that would
fit<00:02:56.390> the<00:02:56.840> right<00:02:57.079> height<00:02:57.530> on<00:02:57.799> this<00:02:58.549> side<00:02:59.060> now

00:02:59.680 --> 00:02:59.690 
fit the right height on this side now

00:02:59.690 --> 00:03:00.970 
fit the right height on this side now
I've<00:02:59.810> cut<00:02:59.989> this<00:03:00.140> one<00:03:00.349> down<00:03:00.560> a<00:03:00.590> little<00:03:00.829> bit

00:03:00.970 --> 00:03:00.980 
I've cut this one down a little bit

00:03:00.980 --> 00:03:02.740 
I've cut this one down a little bit
shorter<00:03:01.549> and<00:03:01.760> I<00:03:01.879> can<00:03:02.030> kind<00:03:02.239> of<00:03:02.299> just<00:03:02.480> swing<00:03:02.720> it

00:03:02.740 --> 00:03:02.750 
shorter and I can kind of just swing it

00:03:02.750 --> 00:03:04.869 
shorter and I can kind of just swing it
around<00:03:02.930> and<00:03:03.230> just<00:03:03.319> make<00:03:03.530> sure<00:03:04.129> that<00:03:04.160> I<00:03:04.610> have

00:03:04.869 --> 00:03:04.879 
around and just make sure that I have

00:03:04.879 --> 00:03:07.030 
around and just make sure that I have
enough<00:03:04.910> clearance<00:03:05.420> between<00:03:05.780> those<00:03:06.170> and<00:03:06.530> I'm

00:03:07.030 --> 00:03:07.040 
enough clearance between those and I'm

00:03:07.040 --> 00:03:08.920 
enough clearance between those and I'm
just<00:03:07.220> gluing<00:03:07.549> those<00:03:07.879> on<00:03:08.120> I'll<00:03:08.480> let<00:03:08.629> them<00:03:08.720> sit

00:03:08.920 --> 00:03:08.930 
just gluing those on I'll let them sit

00:03:08.930 --> 00:03:10.660 
just gluing those on I'll let them sit
for<00:03:08.959> about<00:03:09.290> an<00:03:09.410> hour<00:03:09.530> all<00:03:10.190> right<00:03:10.250> now<00:03:10.519> I'm

00:03:10.660 --> 00:03:10.670 
for about an hour all right now I'm

00:03:10.670 --> 00:03:14.770 
for about an hour all right now I'm
taking<00:03:11.090> some<00:03:11.359> quick-set<00:03:12.290> epoxy<00:03:13.280> and<00:03:13.780> putting

00:03:14.770 --> 00:03:14.780 
taking some quick-set epoxy and putting

00:03:14.780 --> 00:03:23.830 
taking some quick-set epoxy and putting
it<00:03:14.900> inside<00:03:15.200> of<00:03:16.130> one<00:03:16.940> of<00:03:17.389> these<00:03:17.690> holes

00:03:23.830 --> 00:03:23.840 

00:03:23.840 --> 00:03:26.809 

on<00:03:24.840> each<00:03:25.230> of<00:03:25.409> these<00:03:25.530> two<00:03:25.799> top<00:03:26.099> pieces<00:03:26.430> I'm

00:03:26.809 --> 00:03:26.819 
on each of these two top pieces I'm

00:03:26.819 --> 00:03:27.920 
on each of these two top pieces I'm
going<00:03:26.849> to<00:03:27.060> drill<00:03:27.329> a<00:03:27.510> hole

00:03:27.920 --> 00:03:27.930 
going to drill a hole

00:03:27.930 --> 00:03:30.589 
going to drill a hole
halfway<00:03:28.319> through<00:03:28.790> every<00:03:29.790> one<00:03:30.180> and<00:03:30.329> a<00:03:30.390> half

00:03:30.589 --> 00:03:30.599 
halfway through every one and a half

00:03:30.599 --> 00:03:33.830 
halfway through every one and a half
inches<00:03:31.290> so<00:03:31.560> to<00:03:32.489> a<00:03:32.610> simple<00:03:33.000> base<00:03:33.329> I'm<00:03:33.659> just

00:03:33.830 --> 00:03:33.840 
inches so to a simple base I'm just

00:03:33.840 --> 00:03:35.899 
inches so to a simple base I'm just
going<00:03:33.959> to<00:03:34.019> take<00:03:34.170> a<00:03:34.200> bolt<00:03:34.590> and<00:03:34.890> I'll<00:03:35.340> just<00:03:35.489> drop

00:03:35.899 --> 00:03:35.909 
going to take a bolt and I'll just drop

00:03:35.909 --> 00:03:40.160 
going to take a bolt and I'll just drop
it<00:03:36.180> into<00:03:36.650> the<00:03:37.650> hole<00:03:37.680> I<00:03:38.489> can<00:03:39.450> get<00:03:39.629> it<00:03:39.750> there<00:03:39.780> like

00:03:40.160 --> 00:03:40.170 
it into the hole I can get it there like

00:03:40.170 --> 00:03:42.440 
it into the hole I can get it there like
that<00:03:40.409> okay<00:03:40.890> so<00:03:41.040> this<00:03:41.370> part<00:03:41.700> will<00:03:41.849> come<00:03:42.090> up<00:03:42.239> like

00:03:42.440 --> 00:03:42.450 
that okay so this part will come up like

00:03:42.450 --> 00:03:45.160 
that okay so this part will come up like
that<00:03:42.689> and<00:03:42.930> then<00:03:43.349> this<00:03:43.650> part<00:03:44.010> will<00:03:44.099> latch<00:03:44.609> on

00:03:45.160 --> 00:03:45.170 
that and then this part will latch on

00:03:45.170 --> 00:03:48.670 
that and then this part will latch on
like<00:03:46.170> that<00:03:46.530> and<00:03:46.829> I've<00:03:47.189> got<00:03:47.220> a<00:03:47.370> wing<00:03:47.700> nut<00:03:48.030> here

00:03:48.670 --> 00:03:48.680 
like that and I've got a wing nut here

00:03:48.680 --> 00:03:56.059 
like that and I've got a wing nut here
that<00:03:49.680> I<00:03:49.829> can<00:03:50.099> tighten<00:03:50.700> down<00:03:54.319> like<00:03:55.319> that<00:03:55.560> before

00:03:56.059 --> 00:03:56.069 
that I can tighten down like that before

00:03:56.069 --> 00:04:00.229 
that I can tighten down like that before
I<00:03:56.340> glue<00:03:56.579> that<00:03:56.909> top<00:03:57.239> spinning<00:03:57.810> piece<00:03:58.230> on<00:03:59.239> to

00:04:00.229 --> 00:04:00.239 
I glue that top spinning piece on to

00:04:00.239 --> 00:04:02.629 
I glue that top spinning piece on to
this<00:04:00.659> onto<00:04:01.230> the<00:04:01.349> base<00:04:01.560> I'm<00:04:02.129> going<00:04:02.310> to<00:04:02.370> put<00:04:02.609> a

00:04:02.629 --> 00:04:02.639 
this onto the base I'm going to put a

00:04:02.639 --> 00:04:06.170 
this onto the base I'm going to put a
little<00:04:03.030> glue<00:04:03.450> a<00:04:03.810> little<00:04:03.840> epoxy<00:04:04.760> just<00:04:05.760> a<00:04:05.940> little

00:04:06.170 --> 00:04:06.180 
little glue a little epoxy just a little

00:04:06.180 --> 00:04:11.899 
little glue a little epoxy just a little
on<00:04:06.329> the<00:04:06.420> inside<00:04:06.450> of<00:04:06.930> this<00:04:07.260> bolt<00:04:07.739> and<00:04:10.639> I<00:04:11.639> need<00:04:11.819> to

00:04:11.899 --> 00:04:11.909 
on the inside of this bolt and I need to

00:04:11.909 --> 00:04:17.229 
on the inside of this bolt and I need to
do<00:04:12.030> the<00:04:12.180> same<00:04:12.420> on<00:04:12.780> the<00:04:13.470> other<00:04:13.739> bolt

00:04:17.229 --> 00:04:17.239 

00:04:17.239 --> 00:04:20.409 

all<00:04:17.959> right<00:04:18.139> now<00:04:18.319> I<00:04:18.380> can<00:04:18.680> epoxy<00:04:19.069> this<00:04:19.639> top<00:04:20.030> piece

00:04:20.409 --> 00:04:20.419 
all right now I can epoxy this top piece

00:04:20.419 --> 00:04:27.670 
all right now I can epoxy this top piece
on<00:04:20.630> just<00:04:20.690> like<00:04:21.139> I<00:04:21.289> did<00:04:21.530> the<00:04:21.799> base<00:04:22.130> I<00:04:26.289> cut<00:04:27.289> four

00:04:27.670 --> 00:04:27.680 
on just like I did the base I cut four

00:04:27.680 --> 00:04:30.580 
on just like I did the base I cut four
dowels<00:04:28.490> about<00:04:28.910> five<00:04:29.210> inches<00:04:29.599> long<00:04:29.660> and<00:04:29.960> you

00:04:30.580 --> 00:04:30.590 
dowels about five inches long and you

00:04:30.590 --> 00:04:33.879 
dowels about five inches long and you
know<00:04:30.889> they'll<00:04:31.099> fit<00:04:31.310> into<00:04:31.490> these<00:04:32.389> holes<00:04:32.889> like

00:04:33.879 --> 00:04:33.889 
know they'll fit into these holes like

00:04:33.889 --> 00:04:37.300
