00:03:26.900 --> 00:03:29.440 
here and they're like I know if you guys
can<00:03:26.959> see<00:03:27.170> that<00:03:27.620> but<00:03:28.370> they're<00:03:28.639> like

00:03:29.440 --> 00:03:29.450 
can see that but they're like

00:03:29.450 --> 00:03:32.650 
can see that but they're like
holographic<00:03:30.380> like<00:03:30.530> 3d<00:03:31.040> or<00:03:31.220> whatever<00:03:31.660> so

00:03:32.650 --> 00:03:32.660 
holographic like 3d or whatever so

00:03:32.660 --> 00:03:35.949 
holographic like 3d or whatever so
that's<00:03:33.230> what<00:03:33.440> they<00:03:33.560> look<00:03:33.769> like<00:03:33.799> and<00:03:34.310> then<00:03:35.090> I

00:03:38.379 --> 00:03:38.389 
have a projector I think that's what

00:03:38.389 --> 00:03:40.900 
have a projector I think that's what
it's<00:03:38.510> called<00:03:38.569> and<00:03:38.930> it's<00:03:39.799> for<00:03:40.130> math<00:03:40.340> for<00:03:40.730> this

00:03:40.900 --> 00:03:40.910 
it's called and it's for math for this

00:03:40.910 --> 00:03:45.240 
it's called and it's for math for this
year<00:03:41.239> and<00:03:41.450> then<00:03:41.660> i<00:03:41.690> have<00:03:41.989> my<00:03:42.549> like<00:03:43.549> Fitness
