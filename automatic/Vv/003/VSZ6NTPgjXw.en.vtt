as<00:00:35.150> I'm<00:00:35.300> competing<00:00:35.660> for<00:00:35.920> powerlifting<00:00:36.920> that

00:00:37.720 --> 00:00:37.730 
as I'm competing for powerlifting that

00:00:37.730 --> 00:00:41.619 
as I'm competing for powerlifting that
dictates<00:00:38.390> it<00:00:38.570> demands<00:00:38.930> a<00:00:39.199> certain<00:00:39.400> form<00:00:40.629> to

00:00:41.619 --> 00:00:41.629 
dictates it demands a certain form to

00:00:41.629 --> 00:00:44.890 
dictates it demands a certain form to
lift<00:00:41.900> a<00:00:42.199> certain<00:00:42.710> weight<00:00:42.949> and<00:00:43.510> it<00:00:44.510> all<00:00:44.629> really

00:00:44.890 --> 00:00:44.900 
lift a certain weight and it all really

00:00:44.900 --> 00:00:47.680 
lift a certain weight and it all really
depends<00:00:45.530> on<00:00:45.799> what<00:00:46.070> your<00:00:46.220> purpose<00:00:46.820> is<00:00:47.000> meaning

depends on what your purpose is meaning

00:00:47.690 --> 00:00:50.740 
depends on what your purpose is meaning
are<00:00:48.140> you<00:00:48.409> training<00:00:48.769> just<00:00:49.100> for<00:00:49.280> aesthetics<00:00:49.879> are

00:00:50.740 --> 00:00:50.750 
are you training just for aesthetics are

00:00:50.750 --> 00:00:52.810 
are you training just for aesthetics are
you<00:00:50.900> training<00:00:51.229> to<00:00:51.470> lift<00:00:51.710> a<00:00:51.860> certain<00:00:52.250> weight<00:00:52.519> or

you training to lift a certain weight or

00:00:52.820 --> 00:00:54.700 
you training to lift a certain weight or
you're<00:00:53.030> competing<00:00:53.330> for<00:00:53.510> certain<00:00:53.989> competition

00:00:54.700 --> 00:00:54.710 
you're competing for certain competition

00:00:54.710 --> 00:00:57.009 
you're competing for certain competition
that's<00:00:55.640> really<00:00:56.089> important<00:00:56.479> and<00:00:56.600> once<00:00:56.869> you

00:00:57.009 --> 00:00:57.019 
that's really important and once you

00:00:57.019 --> 00:00:59.609 
that's really important and once you
address<00:00:57.350> that<00:00:57.589> and<00:00:58.129> identify<00:00:58.250> what<00:00:59.000> for<00:00:59.269> many

00:00:59.609 --> 00:00:59.619 
address that and identify what for many

00:00:59.619 --> 00:01:02.320 
address that and identify what for many
however<00:01:00.619> let's<00:01:01.040> just<00:01:01.220> talk<00:01:01.400> about<00:01:01.430> aesthetics

00:01:02.320 --> 00:01:02.330 
however let's just talk about aesthetics

00:01:02.330 --> 00:01:06.010 
however let's just talk about aesthetics
in<00:01:02.540> general<00:01:03.170> mechanics<00:01:03.850> one<00:01:04.850> parallel<00:01:05.570> squad

00:01:06.010 --> 00:01:06.020 
in general mechanics one parallel squad

00:01:06.020 --> 00:01:07.990 
in general mechanics one parallel squad
so<00:01:06.320> let's<00:01:06.470> just<00:01:06.619> say<00:01:06.710> up<00:01:06.920> to<00:01:06.950> 90<00:01:07.340> degrees<00:01:07.670> right

00:01:07.990 --> 00:01:08.000 
so let's just say up to 90 degrees right

00:01:08.000 --> 00:01:10.590 
so let's just say up to 90 degrees right
so<00:01:08.510> going<00:01:08.689> 90<00:01:08.900> degrees<00:01:09.080> pausing<00:01:10.070> over<00:01:10.159> here

00:01:10.590 --> 00:01:10.600 
so going 90 degrees pausing over here

00:01:10.600 --> 00:01:13.510 
so going 90 degrees pausing over here
then<00:01:11.600> going<00:01:11.780> back<00:01:11.930> up<00:01:12.140> there's<00:01:13.130> a<00:01:13.189> couple<00:01:13.369> of

00:01:13.510 --> 00:01:13.520 
then going back up there's a couple of

00:01:13.520 --> 00:01:16.149 
then going back up there's a couple of
problems<00:01:13.700> with<00:01:14.060> that<00:01:14.150> squad<00:01:14.770> number<00:01:15.770> one<00:01:15.979> has

00:01:16.149 --> 00:01:16.159 
problems with that squad number one has

00:01:16.159 --> 00:01:19.090 
problems with that squad number one has
a<00:01:16.189> lot<00:01:16.400> of<00:01:16.549> load<00:01:16.729> on<00:01:16.970> the<00:01:17.030> knee<00:01:17.210> okay<00:01:18.170> that's

00:01:19.090 --> 00:01:19.100 
a lot of load on the knee okay that's

00:01:19.100 --> 00:01:21.399 
a lot of load on the knee okay that's
what<00:01:19.369> usually<00:01:19.520> people<00:01:19.909> talk<00:01:20.090> about<00:01:20.240> but<00:01:21.140> what

00:01:21.399 --> 00:01:21.409 
what usually people talk about but what

00:01:21.409 --> 00:01:23.319 
what usually people talk about but what
I<00:01:21.469> like<00:01:21.740> to<00:01:21.890> address<00:01:22.070> is<00:01:22.369> more<00:01:22.609> or<00:01:22.700> less<00:01:22.759> the

00:01:23.319 --> 00:01:23.329 
I like to address is more or less the

00:01:23.329 --> 00:01:25.389 
I like to address is more or less the
mechanical<00:01:23.960> adaptation<00:01:24.799> and<00:01:24.920> the<00:01:24.979> central

00:01:25.389 --> 00:01:25.399 
mechanical adaptation and the central

00:01:25.399 --> 00:01:26.969 
mechanical adaptation and the central
nervous<00:01:25.549> system

00:01:26.969 --> 00:01:26.979 
nervous system

00:01:26.979 --> 00:01:30.600 
nervous system
when<00:01:27.370> one<00:01:27.610> keeps<00:01:27.970> up<00:01:28.150> blood<00:01:29.020> how<00:01:29.560> para<00:01:30.010> like<00:01:30.310> so

00:01:30.600 --> 00:01:30.610 
when one keeps up blood how para like so

00:01:30.610 --> 00:01:33.240 
when one keeps up blood how para like so
one<00:01:31.420> I<00:01:31.690> think<00:01:31.810> loses<00:01:32.380> the<00:01:32.500> ability<00:01:32.590> to

00:01:33.240 --> 00:01:33.250 
one I think loses the ability to

00:01:33.250 --> 00:01:36.030 
one I think loses the ability to
actually<00:01:33.520> increase<00:01:34.060> his<00:01:34.479> or<00:01:34.659> her<00:01:34.810> mobility<00:01:35.500> so

00:01:36.030 --> 00:01:36.040 
actually increase his or her mobility so

00:01:36.040 --> 00:01:38.340 
actually increase his or her mobility so
I<00:01:36.070> always<00:01:36.640> suggest<00:01:37.180> that<00:01:37.630> anyone<00:01:37.869> starting

00:01:38.340 --> 00:01:38.350 
I always suggest that anyone starting

00:01:38.350 --> 00:01:41.160 
I always suggest that anyone starting
off<00:01:38.560> and<00:01:38.770> squats<00:01:39.250> really<00:01:40.240> mimic<00:01:40.659> and<00:01:40.840> look<00:01:40.990> how

00:01:41.160 --> 00:01:41.170 
off and squats really mimic and look how

00:01:41.170 --> 00:01:43.350 
off and squats really mimic and look how
Olympic<00:01:41.710> lifters<00:01:42.190> live<00:01:42.580> you<00:01:42.880> know<00:01:42.970> these<00:01:43.150> guys

00:01:43.350 --> 00:01:43.360 
Olympic lifters live you know these guys

00:01:43.360 --> 00:01:46.560 
Olympic lifters live you know these guys
and<00:01:43.780> gals<00:01:44.110> are<00:01:44.380> lifting<00:01:45.369> crazy<00:01:45.940> amounts<00:01:46.450> of

00:01:46.560 --> 00:01:46.570 
and gals are lifting crazy amounts of

00:01:46.570 --> 00:01:48.719 
and gals are lifting crazy amounts of
weights<00:01:46.869> that<00:01:47.050> some<00:01:47.649> people<00:01:47.979> can't<00:01:48.250> even<00:01:48.399> done

00:01:48.719 --> 00:01:48.729 
weights that some people can't even done

00:01:48.729 --> 00:01:50.460 
weights that some people can't even done
with<00:01:48.909> you<00:01:49.330> know<00:01:49.450> what<00:01:49.600> they're<00:01:50.259> cleaning

00:01:50.460 --> 00:01:50.470 
with you know what they're cleaning

00:01:50.470 --> 00:01:52.590 
with you know what they're cleaning
jerking<00:01:50.920> it<00:01:51.040> right<00:01:51.280> so<00:01:52.090> if<00:01:52.149> we're<00:01:52.300> looking<00:01:52.330> at

00:01:52.590 --> 00:01:52.600 
jerking it right so if we're looking at

00:01:52.600 --> 00:01:54.660 
jerking it right so if we're looking at
this<00:01:52.750> stick<00:01:53.020> you<00:01:53.290> know<00:01:53.340> we're<00:01:54.340> gonna<00:01:54.430> go<00:01:54.520> back

00:01:54.660 --> 00:01:54.670 
this stick you know we're gonna go back

00:01:54.670 --> 00:01:57.930 
this stick you know we're gonna go back
here<00:01:55.000> and<00:01:55.740> what<00:01:56.740> I<00:01:56.770> mean<00:01:57.130> is<00:01:57.280> so<00:01:57.430> important

00:01:57.930 --> 00:01:57.940 
here and what I mean is so important

00:01:57.940 --> 00:01:59.460 
here and what I mean is so important
about<00:01:58.000> going<00:01:58.450> down<00:01:58.659> and<00:01:59.020> the<00:01:59.080> full<00:01:59.289> range

00:01:59.460 --> 00:01:59.470 
about going down and the full range

00:01:59.470 --> 00:02:01.590 
about going down and the full range
motion<00:01:59.590> is<00:02:00.160> you're<00:02:00.850> gonna<00:02:00.970> actually<00:02:01.210> serve

00:02:01.590 --> 00:02:01.600 
motion is you're gonna actually serve

00:02:01.600 --> 00:02:04.620 
motion is you're gonna actually serve
the<00:02:01.869> programming<00:02:02.770> the<00:02:03.009> mechanics<00:02:03.640> of<00:02:03.910> your

00:02:04.620 --> 00:02:04.630 
the programming the mechanics of your

00:02:04.630 --> 00:02:07.169 
the programming the mechanics of your
body<00:02:04.899> it's<00:02:05.619> really<00:02:06.039> really<00:02:06.429> critical<00:02:06.700> that

00:02:07.169 --> 00:02:07.179 
body it's really really critical that

00:02:07.179 --> 00:02:09.560 
body it's really really critical that
every<00:02:07.539> single<00:02:07.899> human<00:02:08.080> being<00:02:08.289> on<00:02:08.979> this<00:02:09.220> planet

00:02:09.560 --> 00:02:09.570 
every single human being on this planet

00:02:09.570 --> 00:02:12.479 
every single human being on this planet
learns<00:02:10.570> how<00:02:10.720> to<00:02:10.750> squad<00:02:11.140> naturally<00:02:12.010> and
