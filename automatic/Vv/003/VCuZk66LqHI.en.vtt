00:00:51.170 --> 00:00:56.659
 the history of river shrimp is known 

00:00:53.750 --> 00:00:58.579
 since pre-Columbian times the ancient 

00:00:56.659 --> 00:01:01.399
 cultures of Peru had already 

00:00:58.579 --> 00:01:05.320
 immortalized in stones earthenware 

00:01:01.399 --> 00:01:05.320
 even in precious gold objects 

00:01:05.500 --> 00:01:10.240
 where his superb appearance was 

00:01:08.020 --> 00:01:12.140
 carved forever as a symbol of 

00:01:10.240 --> 00:01:14.810
 your culture 

00:01:12.140 --> 00:01:17.270
 a paying tribute to the noble shrimp of 

00:01:14.810 --> 00:01:20.590
 river important resource in the 

00:01:17.270 --> 00:01:23.259
 survival of the peoples of the north 

00:01:20.590 --> 00:01:26.690
 that delighted their tables with flavors that 

00:01:23.259 --> 00:01:29.650
 they even accompany them in other lives 

00:01:26.690 --> 00:01:29.650
 yes 

00:01:33.630 --> 00:01:39.180
 The scientific name of this shrimp is 

00:01:36.119 --> 00:01:41.280
 cementary crisis this species is 

00:01:39.180 --> 00:01:44.189
 endemic to northern Chile and southern Chile 

00:01:41.280 --> 00:01:47.050
 peru this means that they do not exist in 

00:01:44.189 --> 00:01:50.020
 no other part of the world 

00:01:47.050 --> 00:01:52.450
 the skeleton of these shrimp as well 

00:01:50.020 --> 00:01:54.010
 that insects and crustaceans are 

00:01:52.450 --> 00:01:56.370
 found on the outside of the 

00:01:54.010 --> 00:01:56.370
 body 

00:01:57.030 --> 00:02:02.340
 it is known as exoskeleton and is 

00:02:00.390 --> 00:02:04.590
 composed with the same protein that 

00:02:02.340 --> 00:02:07.020
 our nails are made with the 

00:02:04.590 --> 00:02:09.600
 difference that they also have their 

00:02:07.020 --> 00:02:13.400
 reinforcement reinforced with calcium which 

00:02:09.600 --> 00:02:13.400
 makes them harder and more resistant 

00:02:19.230 --> 00:02:24.030
 and if it's hard, the males will 

00:02:22.260 --> 00:02:26.849
 characterized by having one of their 

00:02:24.030 --> 00:02:29.640
 tongs bigger than the other while 

00:02:26.849 --> 00:02:34.290
 those of the females are smaller and 

00:02:29.640 --> 00:02:35.700
 of the same size with each other during their 

00:02:34.290 --> 00:02:37.530
 Lifecycle 

00:02:35.700 --> 00:02:40.440
 these shrimp perform great 

00:02:37.530 --> 00:02:42.480
 migrations along the rivers the 

00:02:40.440 --> 00:02:44.340
 studies have revealed that in 

00:02:42.480 --> 00:02:48.060
 main basins of the region of 

00:02:44.340 --> 00:02:50.010
 coquimbo elqui limarÃ­ and choapa los 

00:02:48.060 --> 00:02:52.280
 large males live closer to the 

00:02:50.010 --> 00:02:55.230
 mountain range in areas of greater height 

00:02:52.280 --> 00:02:57.780
 while the medium-sized ones 

00:02:55.230 --> 00:03:00.299
 do in average heights and the females 

00:02:57.780 --> 00:03:03.769
 they live in areas of nearby changing rooms 

00:03:00.299 --> 00:03:03.769
 to the mouths of rivers 

00:03:05.670 --> 00:03:13.260
 and a female can carry between 10,000 to 

00:03:10.230 --> 00:03:15.930
 30,000 eggs is like a woman 

00:03:13.260 --> 00:03:18.300
 transport in your belly to all 

00:03:15.930 --> 00:03:20.599
 people who fill a stadium of size 

00:03:18.300 --> 00:03:20.599
 medium 

00:03:20.810 --> 00:03:27.610
 after the eggs hatch the 

00:03:23.690 --> 00:03:27.610
 larvae begins on a trip downstream 

00:03:29.500 --> 00:03:34.640
 here he performs the metamorphosis that 

00:03:32.900 --> 00:03:37.270
 will allow to become shrimp 

00:03:34.640 --> 00:03:37.270
 youth 

00:03:40.950 --> 00:03:46.110
 after getting his final appearance 

00:03:43.250 --> 00:03:49.110
 begins on the return trip river 

00:03:46.110 --> 00:03:51.709
 up where they will grow and become 

00:03:49.110 --> 00:03:51.709
 in adults 

00:03:52.410 --> 00:03:55.820
 but the life of the shrimp is not 

00:03:55.080 --> 00:03:58.530
 easy 

00:03:55.820 --> 00:04:01.860
 your life cycles are drastically 

00:03:58.530 --> 00:04:03.960
 affected by climatic factors the 

00:04:01.860 --> 00:04:06.270
 drought for example reduces 

00:04:03.960 --> 00:04:08.490
 considerably the shelters for 

00:04:06.270 --> 00:04:11.640
 males and the new juveniles that 

00:04:08.490 --> 00:04:14.370
 they incorporate the population 

00:04:11.640 --> 00:04:17.489
 in the past they were also prey to the 

00:04:14.370 --> 00:04:19.890
 human overexploitation shrimp 

00:04:17.489 --> 00:04:21.630
 river for centuries has been the sustenance of 

00:04:19.890 --> 00:04:23.959
 the inhabitants of the banks of the 

00:04:21.630 --> 00:04:23.959
 rivers 

00:04:26.730 --> 00:04:31.460
 today there are more than a thousand families 

00:04:29.100 --> 00:04:34.290
 capture and market these shrimp 

00:04:31.460 --> 00:04:37.970
 divided into different groupings at 

00:04:34.290 --> 00:04:37.970
 throughout the north of the country 

00:04:40.540 --> 00:04:45.360
 they are currently 

00:04:42.760 --> 00:04:49.210
 classified as vulnerable species 

00:04:45.360 --> 00:04:51.550
 which means that there is a high 

00:04:49.210 --> 00:04:54.030
 probability that they will reach danger 

00:04:51.550 --> 00:04:54.030
 of extinction 

00:04:56.289 --> 00:05:02.080
 to prevent its extinction every year between 

00:04:59.439 --> 00:05:04.479
 the months of December and April apply 

00:05:02.080 --> 00:05:07.569
 a ban on their catches and remains 

00:05:04.479 --> 00:05:09.819
 banned from the rivers due to 

00:05:07.569 --> 00:05:13.830
 that during these months they 

00:05:09.819 --> 00:05:13.830
 reproduce and increase their populations 

00:05:14.440 --> 00:05:19.380
 In addition to this measure has been banned 

00:05:17.200 --> 00:05:21.910
 throughout the year and forever 

00:05:19.380 --> 00:05:25.120
 catch shrimp whose size the 

00:05:21.910 --> 00:05:27.240
 cephalothorax is less than 3 centimeters from 

00:05:25.120 --> 00:05:27.240
 long 

00:05:27.400 --> 00:05:33.430
 and understand the life story of these 

00:05:29.860 --> 00:05:36.340
 Shrimp has been a complex task 

00:05:33.430 --> 00:05:37.960
 decades of hard work have been invested 

00:05:36.340 --> 00:05:40.390
 the scientists of the university 

00:05:37.960 --> 00:05:42.610
 Catholic Church to find the 

00:05:40.390 --> 00:05:46.340
 keys to the life cycle and 

00:05:42.610 --> 00:05:49.280
 reproduction of these animals 

00:05:46.340 --> 00:05:51.830
 various studies and experiments 

00:05:49.280 --> 00:05:54.410
 facilities must have been employed 

00:05:51.830 --> 00:05:56.570
 to discover its nature and power 

00:05:54.410 --> 00:05:59.110
 direct the protection plans that 

00:05:56.570 --> 00:05:59.110
 have preserved 

00:05:59.409 --> 00:06:03.539
 a fascinating aspect that they have 

00:06:01.479 --> 00:06:07.029
 discovered these and other researchers 

00:06:03.539 --> 00:06:09.459
 who have studied this species is that 

00:06:07.029 --> 00:06:12.789
 they come originally from madrid 

00:06:09.459 --> 00:06:15.659
 where common ancestors of 

00:06:12.789 --> 00:06:15.659
 these shrimp 

00:06:22.610 --> 00:06:27.979
 one of the behaviors that relate them 

00:06:25.250 --> 00:06:29.270
 with the ocean is when they leave the 

00:06:27.979 --> 00:06:32.420
 egg 

00:06:29.270 --> 00:06:34.940
 larvae migrate towards the sea to 

00:06:32.420 --> 00:06:37.980
 then return to fresh water in a process 

00:06:34.940 --> 00:06:40.830
 called anfi drop 

00:06:37.980 --> 00:06:43.230
 all these aspects must have been 

00:06:40.830 --> 00:06:45.840
 replicated by science to be able 

00:06:43.230 --> 00:06:47.940
 breed them in controlled environments to 

00:06:45.840 --> 00:06:50.850
 then be returned to the natural environment 

00:06:47.940 --> 00:06:53.270
 and so help in the repopulation of this 

00:06:50.850 --> 00:06:53.270
 species 

00:06:59.760 --> 00:07:04.340
 The strategic guidelines of the 

00:07:02.100 --> 00:07:06.870
 Ministry of the Environment of Chile 

00:07:04.340 --> 00:07:09.210
 point out the need to adopt measures 

00:07:06.870 --> 00:07:11.610
 preventive measures that favor 

00:07:09.210 --> 00:07:13.820
 recovery and conservation of flora 

00:07:11.610 --> 00:07:13.820
 and the fauna 

00:07:14.969 --> 00:07:20.699
 and the danger of extinction of this 

00:07:18.089 --> 00:07:23.489
 species is real in the region 

00:07:20.699 --> 00:07:25.849
 metropolitan the river shrimp already left 

00:07:23.489 --> 00:07:25.849
 to exist 

00:07:29.409 --> 00:07:34.510
 help us to take care of it
