00:00:07.490 --> 00:00:11.900
 hello my name is to taste we are good already 

00:00:09.950 --> 00:00:13.010
 you know Christmas is coming so 

00:00:11.900 --> 00:00:15.679
 let's teach some applications 

00:00:13.010 --> 00:00:18.230
 pretty interesting Christmas so 

00:00:15.679 --> 00:00:19.730
 nothing we are going to wink at him from here 

00:00:18.230 --> 00:00:22.400
 we're good we go with the first 

00:00:19.730 --> 00:00:24.859
 application calls full notes this 

00:00:22.400 --> 00:00:26.599
 application history well worth money 

00:00:24.859 --> 00:00:28.429
 that I leave it down in the decision 

00:00:26.599 --> 00:00:31.039
 free ie the entire application 

00:00:28.429 --> 00:00:33.589
 let's go to your adjustments as we are going to 

00:00:31.039 --> 00:00:36.230
 hit you better and here 

00:00:33.589 --> 00:00:39.019
 we have this animated wallpaper 

00:00:36.230 --> 00:00:41.089
 that we can choose several themes 

00:00:39.019 --> 00:00:44.930
 here we have your options that we can 

00:00:41.089 --> 00:00:47.180
 choose snowing winter network 

00:00:44.930 --> 00:00:49.550
 the rain that is thrown or better said 

00:00:47.180 --> 00:00:52.550
 we give stable the wallpaper 

00:00:49.550 --> 00:00:52.910
 and as you can see the boots fall good flakes of 

00:00:52.550 --> 00:00:55.870
 snow 

00:00:52.910 --> 00:00:59.110
 rather, the 

00:00:55.870 --> 00:01:01.520
 application and above I'm recording 

00:00:59.110 --> 00:01:04.369
 so this application to me 

00:01:01.520 --> 00:01:07.040
 I personally like it a lot, let's go 

00:01:04.369 --> 00:01:08.710
 Christmas with 3 of this also has 

00:01:07.040 --> 00:01:12.010
 their 

00:01:08.710 --> 00:01:14.170
 your adjustments that we can choose to the 

00:01:12.010 --> 00:01:17.950
 advertising of these frames by 

00:01:14.170 --> 00:01:24.630
 example we can put 30 colors 

00:01:17.950 --> 00:01:26.340
 black for putting something speed later 

00:01:24.630 --> 00:01:28.890
 As you can see, we can 

00:01:26.340 --> 00:01:31.710
 customize in our own way and also 

00:01:28.890 --> 00:01:34.049
 this application is going pretty well so 

00:01:31.710 --> 00:01:36.360
 I recommend it the third application 

00:01:34.049 --> 00:01:38.340
 it's called snowflake that's pretty 

00:01:36.360 --> 00:01:40.850
 interesting also has its settings 

00:01:38.340 --> 00:01:43.770
 that we can customize to our liking 

00:01:40.850 --> 00:01:46.470
 so nothing that you already look at it 

00:01:43.770 --> 00:01:50.360
 we give you set wallpaper 

00:01:46.470 --> 00:01:54.240
 and as you can see quite fluid the 

00:01:50.360 --> 00:01:58.410
 navigation between one from a desk 

00:01:54.240 --> 00:02:00.930
 to another is forgiveness he gave me so he is 

00:01:58.410 --> 00:02:04.200
 I also like it a lot 

00:02:00.930 --> 00:02:06.320
 this is called animated wallpaper 

00:02:04.200 --> 00:02:09.200
 3d 

00:02:06.320 --> 00:02:12.700
 that are pretty good as you can 

00:02:09.200 --> 00:02:12.700
 see if I move my finger moves too 

00:02:13.100 --> 00:02:18.740
 the animation is unfortunately not 

00:02:16.370 --> 00:02:20.870
 we can choose 

00:02:18.740 --> 00:02:24.740
 scene selection can not choose 

00:02:20.870 --> 00:02:27.680
 nothing because you have to pay level of 

00:02:24.740 --> 00:02:30.020
 Details we can choose the details 

00:02:27.680 --> 00:02:33.260
 of if the graphics as we want them to be 

00:02:30.020 --> 00:02:37.340
 see in advanced settings we have for 

00:02:33.260 --> 00:02:39.080
 customize the graphics and little else if 

00:02:37.340 --> 00:02:42.770
 is the moment you have not found in 

00:02:39.080 --> 00:02:45.350
 mental that I find it I will tell you and I 

00:02:42.770 --> 00:02:47.290
 I'll leave it down the decision and if it's me 

00:02:45.350 --> 00:02:50.600
 forget you can tell me 

00:02:47.290 --> 00:02:52.880
 well after a while in this 

00:02:50.600 --> 00:02:55.760
 application is changed and here it will put you 

00:02:52.880 --> 00:02:57.620
 a numbers that is to say will put you the days 

00:02:55.760 --> 00:03:00.320
 that the hours are the minutes and the 

00:02:57.620 --> 00:03:04.280
 seconds until Christmas is to say the 

00:03:00.320 --> 00:03:08.810
 December 24th as you can see it at 

00:03:04.280 --> 00:03:11.530
 that puts it 18 days 10 hours 45 minutes 

00:03:08.810 --> 00:03:15.170
 and 15 seconds that's pretty good 

00:03:11.530 --> 00:03:17.330
 days for Christmas puts it there as 

00:03:15.170 --> 00:03:21.590
 you can see so we're not going with the 

00:03:17.330 --> 00:03:23.860
 another application that is christmas sounds 

00:03:21.590 --> 00:03:25.819
 this application questions them very 

00:03:23.860 --> 00:03:27.650
 fluidly but it's pretty 

00:03:25.819 --> 00:03:30.500
 interesting because they have fuck with the 

00:03:27.650 --> 00:03:32.959
 advertising has quite sounds 

00:03:30.500 --> 00:03:36.170
 interesting that we can expose for 

00:03:32.959 --> 00:03:38.069
 sound the alarm as notification by 

00:03:36.170 --> 00:03:41.760
 example we give to 

00:03:38.069 --> 00:03:44.579
 jim gamble click on this button we 

00:03:41.760 --> 00:03:47.550
 will start singing and if we give ok 

00:03:44.579 --> 00:03:49.920
 we can put them as ringtones 

00:03:47.550 --> 00:03:52.350
 be a person or do not call us a 

00:03:49.920 --> 00:03:54.630
 person that we choose the person and read 

00:03:52.350 --> 00:03:57.720
 and that we put that sound on 

00:03:54.630 --> 00:04:00.990
 notification and alarm truth because I 

00:03:57.720 --> 00:04:03.560
 studying is that it is good and if we give it 

00:04:00.990 --> 00:04:03.560
 about him 

00:04:03.880 --> 00:04:06.660
 we have heard 

00:04:08.850 --> 00:04:16.340
 and it has enough interesting sounds 

00:04:12.890 --> 00:04:19.010
