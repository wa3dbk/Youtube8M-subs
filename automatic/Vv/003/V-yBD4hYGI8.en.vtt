00:02:48.800 --> 00:02:53.449 
you're just gonna have it go around and
depending<00:02:49.800> on<00:02:49.950> how<00:02:50.400> long<00:02:51.620> this<00:02:52.620> is<00:02:52.950> if<00:02:53.220> it's

00:02:53.449 --> 00:02:53.459 
depending on how long this is if it's

00:02:53.459 --> 00:02:57.650 
depending on how long this is if it's
less<00:02:53.700> than<00:02:53.730> 50<00:02:54.300> 15<00:02:55.140> blocks<00:02:55.910> then<00:02:56.910> you<00:02:57.450> won't

00:02:57.650 --> 00:02:57.660 
less than 50 15 blocks then you won't

00:02:57.660 --> 00:02:59.509 
less than 50 15 blocks then you won't
need<00:02:57.810> a<00:02:57.870> repeater<00:02:58.290> but<00:02:58.620> if<00:02:58.800> it<00:02:58.950> is<00:02:59.100> then<00:02:59.400> you're

00:02:59.509 --> 00:02:59.519 
need a repeater but if it is then you're

00:02:59.519 --> 00:03:01.030 
need a repeater but if it is then you're
gonna<00:02:59.670> need<00:02:59.910> a<00:02:59.970> repeater<00:03:00.390> there<00:03:00.690> and

00:03:01.030 --> 00:03:01.040 
gonna need a repeater there and

00:03:01.040 --> 00:03:03.410 
gonna need a repeater there and
basically<00:03:02.040> the<00:03:02.250> signals<00:03:02.700> just<00:03:02.910> gonna<00:03:03.120> turn

00:03:03.410 --> 00:03:03.420 
basically the signals just gonna turn

00:03:03.420 --> 00:03:07.040 
basically the signals just gonna turn
back<00:03:03.660> around<00:03:03.900> and<00:03:04.970> it's<00:03:05.970> gonna<00:03:06.150> go<00:03:06.360> way<00:03:06.989> too

00:03:07.040 --> 00:03:07.050 
back around and it's gonna go way too

00:03:07.050 --> 00:03:08.410 
back around and it's gonna go way too
fast

00:03:08.410 --> 00:03:08.420 
fast

00:03:08.420 --> 00:03:16.490 
fast
so<00:03:09.420> you<00:03:09.870> can<00:03:10.050> just<00:03:12.680> wow<00:03:14.870> what<00:03:15.870> is<00:03:16.019> happening

00:03:16.490 --> 00:03:16.500 
so you can just wow what is happening

00:03:16.500 --> 00:03:22.940 
so you can just wow what is happening
here<00:03:17.450> okay<00:03:18.450> hold<00:03:18.660> on<00:03:19.489> should<00:03:20.489> work<00:03:20.760> now<00:03:21.950> yeah

00:03:22.940 --> 00:03:22.950 
here okay hold on should work now yeah

00:03:22.950 --> 00:03:26.569 
here okay hold on should work now yeah
see<00:03:23.370> so<00:03:23.670> it's<00:03:23.970> it's<00:03:24.510> not<00:03:24.720> very<00:03:24.959> long<00:03:25.170> so<00:03:25.579> it's

00:03:26.569 --> 00:03:26.579 
see so it's it's not very long so it's

00:03:26.579 --> 00:03:29.390 
see so it's it's not very long so it's
not<00:03:27.030> working<00:03:27.510> that<00:03:27.720> great<00:03:28.019> but<00:03:28.440> basically

00:03:29.390 --> 00:03:29.400 
not working that great but basically

00:03:29.400 --> 00:03:34.130 
not working that great but basically
right<00:03:29.940> when<00:03:30.209> the<00:03:31.670> impulse<00:03:32.670> or<00:03:33.000> the<00:03:33.299> power

00:03:34.130 --> 00:03:34.140 
right when the impulse or the power

00:03:34.140 --> 00:03:36.550 
right when the impulse or the power
reaches<00:03:34.530> here<00:03:34.769> it<00:03:34.829> circles<00:03:35.370> back<00:03:35.430> around<00:03:35.610> and

00:03:36.550 --> 00:03:36.560 
reaches here it circles back around and

00:03:36.560 --> 00:03:40.130 
reaches here it circles back around and
starts<00:03:37.560> over<00:03:37.799> again<00:03:38.280> and<00:03:38.519> then<00:03:39.000> the<00:03:39.480> last<00:03:39.750> one

00:03:40.130 --> 00:03:40.140 
starts over again and then the last one

00:03:40.140 --> 00:03:44.300 
starts over again and then the last one
I'm<00:03:40.500> going<00:03:40.890> to<00:03:41.100> show<00:03:41.310> you<00:03:41.370> is<00:03:43.100> this<00:03:44.100> is

00:03:44.300 --> 00:03:44.310 
I'm going to show you is this is

00:03:44.310 --> 00:03:48.470 
I'm going to show you is this is
probably<00:03:44.549> the<00:03:44.880> most<00:03:45.079> interesting<00:03:46.079> one<00:03:46.320> is<00:03:47.480> the

00:03:48.470 --> 00:03:48.480 
probably the most interesting one is the

00:03:48.480 --> 00:03:50.300 
probably the most interesting one is the
one<00:03:48.600> that<00:03:48.660> goes<00:03:48.959> back<00:03:49.320> and<00:03:49.560> forth<00:03:49.590> so<00:03:50.100> all

00:03:50.300 --> 00:03:50.310 
one that goes back and forth so all

00:03:50.310 --> 00:03:51.880 
one that goes back and forth so all
you're<00:03:50.430> gonna<00:03:50.519> do<00:03:50.760> for<00:03:51.000> this<00:03:51.120> one<00:03:51.359> is<00:03:51.540> just

00:03:51.880 --> 00:03:51.890 
you're gonna do for this one is just

00:03:51.890 --> 00:03:55.390 
you're gonna do for this one is just
take<00:03:52.890> your<00:03:52.920> redstone<00:03:53.310> and<00:03:54.000> like<00:03:54.510> same<00:03:54.840> set<00:03:55.079> up

00:03:55.390 --> 00:03:55.400 
take your redstone and like same set up

00:03:55.400 --> 00:04:01.460 
take your redstone and like same set up
put<00:03:56.400> it<00:03:56.519> around<00:03:56.970> and<00:03:57.359> then<00:03:59.450> once<00:04:00.450> again<00:04:00.780> put<00:04:01.200> a

00:04:01.460 --> 00:04:01.470 
put it around and then once again put a

00:04:01.470 --> 00:04:06.949 
put it around and then once again put a
repeater<00:04:02.100> every<00:04:02.670> other<00:04:02.820> one<00:04:03.380> and<00:04:05.959> connect

00:04:06.949 --> 00:04:06.959 
repeater every other one and connect

00:04:06.959 --> 00:04:10.460 
repeater every other one and connect
that<00:04:07.109> with<00:04:07.230> redstone<00:04:07.859> and<00:04:08.750> the<00:04:09.750> repeat<00:04:10.170> or

00:04:10.460 --> 00:04:10.470 
that with redstone and the repeat or

00:04:10.470 --> 00:04:12.830 
that with redstone and the repeat or
yeah<00:04:11.010> connect<00:04:11.310> the<00:04:11.430> repeaters<00:04:11.820> together<00:04:12.180> and

00:04:12.830 --> 00:04:12.840 
yeah connect the repeaters together and

00:04:12.840 --> 00:04:17.150 
yeah connect the repeaters together and
the<00:04:13.410> Redstone<00:04:13.980> like<00:04:14.700> so<00:04:15.269> and<00:04:15.769> you<00:04:16.769> might<00:04:16.950> want

00:04:17.150 --> 00:04:17.160 
the Redstone like so and you might want

00:04:17.160 --> 00:04:21.479 
the Redstone like so and you might want
to<00:04:17.310> repeater<00:04:17.940> here<00:04:18.180> actually

00:04:21.479 --> 00:04:21.489 

00:04:21.489 --> 00:04:25.020 

set<00:04:22.240> these<00:04:22.530> make<00:04:23.530> sure<00:04:23.560> these<00:04:23.950> have<00:04:24.550> the<00:04:24.790> same

00:04:25.020 --> 00:04:25.030 
set these make sure these have the same

00:04:25.030 --> 00:04:28.050 
set these make sure these have the same
timing<00:04:25.570> as<00:04:25.950> these<00:04:26.950> so<00:04:27.220> I<00:04:27.250> said<00:04:27.520> these<00:04:27.700> all<00:04:27.910> at

00:04:28.050 --> 00:04:28.060 
timing as these so I said these all at

00:04:28.060 --> 00:04:34.860 
timing as these so I said these all at
2:00<00:04:28.240> and<00:04:28.510> then<00:04:30.930> connect<00:04:31.950> make<00:04:32.950> sure<00:04:33.130> that<00:04:33.870> the

00:04:34.860 --> 00:04:34.870 
2:00 and then connect make sure that the

00:04:34.870 --> 00:04:37.880 
2:00 and then connect make sure that the
power<00:04:35.290> sources<00:04:35.710> are<00:04:35.830> connected<00:04:36.400> in<00:04:36.550> a<00:04:36.670> loop<00:04:36.910> so

00:04:37.880 --> 00:04:37.890 
power sources are connected in a loop so

00:04:37.890 --> 00:04:42.360 
power sources are connected in a loop so
like<00:04:38.890> like<00:04:39.580> this<00:04:39.790> and<00:04:40.090> then<00:04:40.710> just<00:04:41.710> take<00:04:42.220> your

00:04:42.360 --> 00:04:42.370 
like like this and then just take your

00:04:42.370 --> 00:04:46.830 
like like this and then just take your
lever<00:04:43.200> flick<00:04:44.200> it<00:04:44.350> on<00:04:44.500> and<00:04:44.710> off<00:04:45.420> and<00:04:46.420> it'll<00:04:46.720> go

00:04:46.830 --> 00:04:46.840 
lever flick it on and off and it'll go

00:04:46.840 --> 00:04:50.880 
lever flick it on and off and it'll go
back<00:04:47.110> and<00:04:47.320> forth<00:04:47.590> so<00:04:49.350> thank<00:04:50.350> you<00:04:50.470> guys<00:04:50.650> for
