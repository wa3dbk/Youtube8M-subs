00:04:15.550 --> 00:04:15.560 
maybe not the best idea

00:04:15.560 --> 00:04:21.129

Oh<00:04:19.810> God

00:04:21.129 --> 00:04:21.139

00:04:30.299 --> 00:04:30.309 

00:04:30.309 --> 00:04:37.970 

well<00:04:30.789> I<00:04:30.849> mean<00:04:31.029> it<00:04:31.539> is<00:04:31.599> Blizzard<00:04:32.199> so

00:04:37.970 --> 00:04:37.980 

00:04:37.980 --> 00:04:39.830 

and<00:04:38.460> it<00:04:38.670> was<00:04:38.790> from<00:04:39.060> one<00:04:39.270> of<00:04:39.390> her<00:04:39.510> strongest

00:04:39.830 --> 00:04:39.840 
and it was from one of her strongest

00:04:39.840 --> 00:04:41.720 
and it was from one of her strongest
Pokemon<00:04:40.620> and<00:04:40.830> she<00:04:40.980> I<00:04:41.100> think<00:04:41.160> she's<00:04:41.400> gonna<00:04:41.490> use

00:04:41.720 --> 00:04:41.730 
Pokemon and she I think she's gonna use

00:04:41.730 --> 00:04:44.900 
Pokemon and she I think she's gonna use
her<00:04:41.760> weaker<00:04:42.210> Glalie<00:04:42.480> here<00:04:42.900> which<00:04:43.500> is<00:04:43.770> level<00:04:44.400> 50

00:04:44.900 --> 00:04:44.910 
her weaker Glalie here which is level 50

00:04:44.910 --> 00:04:46.670 
her weaker Glalie here which is level 50
so<00:04:45.210> even<00:04:45.780> though<00:04:45.900> it's<00:04:46.050> her<00:04:46.140> weaker<00:04:46.470> Glalie

00:04:46.670 --> 00:04:46.680 
so even though it's her weaker Glalie

00:04:46.680 --> 00:04:53.840 
so even though it's her weaker Glalie
it's<00:04:47.070> still<00:04:47.400> pretty<00:04:47.670> weak<00:04:47.850> level<00:04:48.210> 52<00:04:52.850> okay

00:04:53.840 --> 00:04:53.850 
it's still pretty weak level 52 okay

00:04:53.850 --> 00:04:56.420
