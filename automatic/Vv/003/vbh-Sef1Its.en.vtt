00:01:12.320 --> 00:01:12.330 
controllers and I used them when my

00:01:12.330 --> 00:01:14.480 
controllers and I used them when my
cousin<00:01:12.570> was<00:01:12.840> here<00:01:13.010> and<00:01:14.010> I<00:01:14.100> thought<00:01:14.280> they<00:01:14.430> were

00:01:14.480 --> 00:01:14.490 
cousin was here and I thought they were

00:01:18.469 --> 00:01:18.479 
these are really good controllers but

00:01:18.479 --> 00:01:21.620 
these are really good controllers but
that<00:01:19.259> was<00:01:19.650> comparing<00:01:20.220> it<00:01:20.340> to<00:01:20.369> a<00:01:21.030> controller

00:01:21.620 --> 00:01:21.630 
that was comparing it to a controller

00:01:21.630 --> 00:01:26.240 
that was comparing it to a controller
that<00:01:21.750> I<00:01:21.900> had<00:01:22.229> that<00:01:22.259> was<00:01:22.619> worn<00:01:22.890> down<00:01:22.979> and<00:01:25.250> you

00:01:26.240 --> 00:01:26.250 
that I had that was worn down and you

00:01:26.250 --> 00:01:28.550 
that I had that was worn down and you
know<00:01:26.369> I<00:01:26.400> thought<00:01:26.670> they<00:01:26.820> were<00:01:26.880> really<00:01:27.119> good<00:01:27.560> the

00:01:28.550 --> 00:01:28.560 
know I thought they were really good the

00:01:28.560 --> 00:01:30.440 
know I thought they were really good the
fact<00:01:28.770> that<00:01:28.860> there<00:01:29.100> are<00:01:29.130> no<00:01:29.340> slow<00:01:29.670> turns<00:01:29.970> that

00:01:30.440 --> 00:01:30.450 
fact that there are no slow turns that

00:01:30.450 --> 00:01:32.660 
fact that there are no slow turns that
took<00:01:30.600> a<00:01:30.689> while<00:01:30.720> to<00:01:30.900> get<00:01:31.140> used<00:01:31.380> to<00:01:31.530> because<00:01:31.740> you

00:01:32.660 --> 00:01:32.670 
took a while to get used to because you

00:01:32.670 --> 00:01:34.370 
took a while to get used to because you
know<00:01:32.790> after<00:01:33.060> a<00:01:33.090> while<00:01:33.119> I<00:01:33.479> think<00:01:33.750> in<00:01:33.960> terms<00:01:34.200> of

00:01:34.370 --> 00:01:34.380 
know after a while I think in terms of

00:01:34.380 --> 00:01:36.830 
know after a while I think in terms of
durability<00:01:34.590> you<00:01:35.430> know<00:01:35.520> that's<00:01:35.780> you<00:01:36.780> know

00:01:36.830 --> 00:01:36.840 
durability you know that's you know

00:01:36.840 --> 00:01:38.330 
durability you know that's you know
that's<00:01:36.900> something<00:01:37.470> that's<00:01:37.710> uncertain<00:01:38.159> I

00:01:38.330 --> 00:01:38.340 
that's something that's uncertain I

00:01:38.340 --> 00:01:39.440 
that's something that's uncertain I
don't<00:01:38.520> know<00:01:38.610> how<00:01:38.729> long<00:01:38.880> these<00:01:39.060> controllers

00:01:39.440 --> 00:01:39.450 
don't know how long these controllers

00:01:39.450 --> 00:01:42.109 
don't know how long these controllers
are<00:01:39.630> going<00:01:39.750> to<00:01:39.810> last<00:01:39.990> me<00:01:40.310> but<00:01:41.310> scuff<00:01:41.640> says<00:01:41.939> I

00:01:42.109 --> 00:01:42.119 
are going to last me but scuff says I

00:01:42.119 --> 00:01:42.859 
are going to last me but scuff says I
think<00:01:42.329> they<00:01:42.390> have<00:01:42.509> like<00:01:42.630> a<00:01:42.659> lifetime

00:01:42.859 --> 00:01:42.869 
think they have like a lifetime

00:01:42.869 --> 00:01:44.690 
think they have like a lifetime
guarantee<00:01:43.170> and<00:01:43.920> send<00:01:44.130> it<00:01:44.250> back<00:01:44.280> to<00:01:44.430> them

00:01:44.690 --> 00:01:44.700 
guarantee and send it back to them

00:01:44.700 --> 00:01:47.149 
guarantee and send it back to them
they'll<00:01:44.880> work<00:01:45.360> in<00:01:45.540> them<00:01:45.770> work<00:01:46.770> on<00:01:46.950> the

they'll work in them work on the

00:01:50.300 --> 00:01:50.310 
controller but my controller was old and

00:01:50.310 --> 00:01:52.910 
controller but my controller was old and
I<00:01:50.939> was<00:01:51.000> compared<00:01:51.420> comparing<00:01:51.990> it<00:01:52.079> to<00:01:52.110> that

00:01:52.910 --> 00:01:52.920 
I was compared comparing it to that

00:01:52.920 --> 00:01:55.160 
I was compared comparing it to that
controller<00:01:53.540> because<00:01:54.540> after<00:01:54.899> a<00:01:54.930> while<00:01:54.960> you

00:01:55.160 --> 00:01:55.170 
controller because after a while you

00:01:55.170 --> 00:01:57.770 
controller because after a while you
know<00:01:55.259> you<00:01:55.320> use<00:01:55.890> your<00:01:56.060> it<00:01:57.060> control<00:01:57.450> their<00:01:57.600> wares

00:01:57.770 --> 00:01:57.780 
know you use your it control their wares

00:01:57.780 --> 00:01:59.929 
know you use your it control their wares
down<00:01:58.110> you<00:01:58.770> know<00:01:58.890> move<00:01:59.430> from<00:01:59.610> left<00:01:59.759> to<00:01:59.880> right

00:01:59.929 --> 00:01:59.939 
down you know move from left to right

00:01:59.939 --> 00:02:02.810 
down you know move from left to right
becomes<00:02:00.479> a<00:02:00.630> little<00:02:00.780> bit<00:02:00.960> sluggish<00:02:01.340> and<00:02:02.340> so

00:02:02.810 --> 00:02:02.820 
becomes a little bit sluggish and so

00:02:02.820 --> 00:02:04.580 
becomes a little bit sluggish and so
that's<00:02:03.000> what<00:02:03.180> I<00:02:03.240> was<00:02:03.420> doing<00:02:03.719> now<00:02:03.990> if<00:02:04.170> I<00:02:04.290> based

00:02:04.580 --> 00:02:04.590 
that's what I was doing now if I based

00:02:04.590 --> 00:02:05.630 
that's what I was doing now if I based
it<00:02:04.770> on

00:02:05.630 --> 00:02:05.640 
it on

00:02:05.640 --> 00:02:08.719 
it on
you<00:02:05.790> know<00:02:05.909> control<00:02:06.420> of<00:02:06.570> that<00:02:06.659> I<00:02:06.720> just<00:02:07.140> bought<00:02:07.729> I

00:02:08.719 --> 00:02:08.729 
you know control of that I just bought I

00:02:08.729 --> 00:02:11.900 
you know control of that I just bought I
wouldn't<00:02:09.539> see<00:02:09.780> you<00:02:10.250> know<00:02:11.250> too<00:02:11.310> much<00:02:11.640> of<00:02:11.819> a

00:02:11.900 --> 00:02:11.910 
wouldn't see you know too much of a

00:02:11.910 --> 00:02:14.270 
wouldn't see you know too much of a
difference<00:02:12.330> it's<00:02:12.930> minuscule<00:02:13.380> it's<00:02:13.980> the<00:02:14.130> point

00:02:14.270 --> 00:02:14.280 
difference it's minuscule it's the point

00:02:14.280 --> 00:02:17.990 
difference it's minuscule it's the point
where<00:02:14.550> it's<00:02:14.670> not<00:02:14.790> even<00:02:15.060> noticeable<00:02:16.850> and<00:02:17.850> I'm

00:02:17.990 --> 00:02:18.000 
where it's not even noticeable and I'm

00:02:18.000 --> 00:02:20.420 
where it's not even noticeable and I'm
not<00:02:18.180> knocking<00:02:18.390> I'm<00:02:19.140> not<00:02:19.350> knocking<00:02:19.770> stuff

00:02:20.420 --> 00:02:20.430 
not knocking I'm not knocking stuff

00:02:20.430 --> 00:02:23.690 
not knocking I'm not knocking stuff
right<00:02:20.910> I<00:02:20.940> think<00:02:21.620> it's<00:02:22.620> a<00:02:22.709> solid<00:02:22.920> product<00:02:23.520> it's

00:02:23.690 --> 00:02:23.700 
right I think it's a solid product it's

00:02:23.700 --> 00:02:25.910 
right I think it's a solid product it's
lighter<00:02:24.000> you<00:02:24.360> know<00:02:24.450> I<00:02:24.480> took<00:02:24.630> I<00:02:25.020> got<00:02:25.260> rid<00:02:25.470> of<00:02:25.500> I

00:02:25.910 --> 00:02:25.920 
lighter you know I took I got rid of I

00:02:25.920 --> 00:02:29.000 
lighter you know I took I got rid of I
got<00:02:26.580> the<00:02:26.700> wireless<00:02:26.910> version<00:02:27.300> I<00:02:27.780> got<00:02:28.740> rid<00:02:28.980> of

00:02:29.000 --> 00:02:29.010 
got the wireless version I got rid of

00:02:29.010 --> 00:02:35.620 
got the wireless version I got rid of
the<00:02:31.850> vibrator<00:02:32.850> I<00:02:33.090> forgot<00:02:33.420> what<00:02:33.600> it's<00:02:33.720> called

00:02:35.620 --> 00:02:35.630 
the vibrator I forgot what it's called

00:02:35.630 --> 00:02:38.120 
the vibrator I forgot what it's called
and<00:02:36.630> I<00:02:36.690> got<00:02:36.840> domed<00:02:37.140> sticks<00:02:37.530> all<00:02:37.770> right<00:02:37.920> I

00:02:38.120 --> 00:02:38.130 
and I got domed sticks all right I

00:02:38.130 --> 00:02:39.979 
and I got domed sticks all right I
thought<00:02:38.489> that<00:02:38.640> would<00:02:38.760> be<00:02:38.820> better<00:02:39.120> but<00:02:39.420> it

00:02:39.979 --> 00:02:39.989 
thought that would be better but it

00:02:39.989 --> 00:02:44.199 
thought that would be better but it
slightly<00:02:40.380> elevates<00:02:41.010> the<00:02:41.720> analog<00:02:42.720> stick<00:02:42.750> and

00:02:44.199 --> 00:02:44.209 
slightly elevates the analog stick and

00:02:44.209 --> 00:02:48.470 
slightly elevates the analog stick and
so<00:02:45.209> I<00:02:45.239> had<00:02:45.570> to<00:02:45.600> get<00:02:46.050> go<00:02:46.290> away<00:02:46.470> from<00:02:46.860> my<00:02:47.760> control

00:02:48.470 --> 00:02:48.480 
so I had to get go away from my control

00:02:48.480 --> 00:02:52.130 
so I had to get go away from my control
freaks<00:02:48.810> to<00:02:49.700> CQC<00:02:50.700> like<00:02:51.030> close-quarter<00:02:51.810> control

00:02:52.130 --> 00:02:52.140 
freaks to CQC like close-quarter control

00:02:52.140 --> 00:02:54.290 
freaks to CQC like close-quarter control
freak<00:02:52.350> so<00:02:52.590> I<00:02:52.620> guess<00:02:53.580> it<00:02:53.700> can<00:02:53.820> bring<00:02:54.000> it<00:02:54.150> back

00:02:54.290 --> 00:02:54.300 
freak so I guess it can bring it back

00:02:54.300 --> 00:02:57.140 
freak so I guess it can bring it back
bring<00:02:54.630> it<00:02:54.870> back<00:02:54.959> to<00:02:55.459> the<00:02:56.459> norm<00:02:56.670> because<00:02:56.820> I<00:02:56.970> have

00:02:57.140 --> 00:02:57.150 
bring it back to the norm because I have

00:02:57.150 --> 00:02:59.360 
bring it back to the norm because I have
big<00:02:57.360> hands<00:02:57.660> and<00:02:57.989> even<00:02:58.500> that<00:02:58.769> was<00:02:58.800> a<00:02:59.040> little<00:02:59.190> bit

00:02:59.360 --> 00:02:59.370 
big hands and even that was a little bit

00:02:59.370 --> 00:03:02.740 
big hands and even that was a little bit
too<00:02:59.519> elevated<00:02:59.760> for<00:03:00.209> me<00:03:00.360> so<00:03:00.510> I<00:03:00.870> have<00:03:01.769> some<00:03:02.070> CQC

00:03:02.740 --> 00:03:02.750 
too elevated for me so I have some CQC

00:03:02.750 --> 00:03:06.770 
too elevated for me so I have some CQC
freaks<00:03:03.750> and<00:03:03.959> I<00:03:04.019> use<00:03:04.200> those<00:03:04.470> and<00:03:05.450> you<00:03:06.450> know<00:03:06.570> it

00:03:06.770 --> 00:03:06.780 
freaks and I use those and you know it

00:03:06.780 --> 00:03:10.009 
freaks and I use those and you know it
works<00:03:06.989> out<00:03:07.170> so<00:03:07.640> the<00:03:08.640> slow<00:03:08.850> turns<00:03:09.090> of<00:03:09.300> fine<00:03:09.510> jump

00:03:10.009 --> 00:03:10.019 
works out so the slow turns of fine jump

00:03:10.019 --> 00:03:12.080 
works out so the slow turns of fine jump
shots<00:03:10.260> are<00:03:10.530> really<00:03:10.560> good<00:03:11.040> really<00:03:11.760> don't<00:03:11.970> have

00:03:12.080 --> 00:03:12.090 
shots are really good really don't have

00:03:12.090 --> 00:03:14.930 
shots are really good really don't have
to<00:03:12.209> get<00:03:12.390> your<00:03:12.540> hands<00:03:12.780> away<00:03:12.959> from<00:03:13.489> the<00:03:14.489> from<00:03:14.910> the

to get your hands away from the from the

00:03:14.940 --> 00:03:16.220 
to get your hands away from the from the
analog<00:03:15.329> stick<00:03:15.360> and<00:03:15.780> that's<00:03:15.900> that's<00:03:16.079> really

00:03:16.220 --> 00:03:16.230 
analog stick and that's that's really

00:03:16.230 --> 00:03:18.740 
analog stick and that's that's really
good<00:03:16.590> and<00:03:16.769> you<00:03:16.910> you<00:03:17.910> know<00:03:18.030> what<00:03:18.180> I<00:03:18.209> found<00:03:18.480> is
