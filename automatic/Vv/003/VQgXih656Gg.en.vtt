I<00:01:30.470> kind<00:01:30.800> of<00:01:30.860> underestimated<00:01:31.130> how<00:01:31.850> difficult

00:01:32.410 --> 00:01:32.420 
I kind of underestimated how difficult

00:01:32.420 --> 00:01:35.470 
I kind of underestimated how difficult
it<00:01:32.600> would<00:01:32.750> be<00:01:32.810> to<00:01:33.310> keep<00:01:34.310> wiping<00:01:34.760> my<00:01:35.030> lips<00:01:35.270> off

00:01:35.470 --> 00:01:35.480 
it would be to keep wiping my lips off

00:01:35.480 --> 00:01:38.140 
it would be to keep wiping my lips off
and<00:01:35.750> everything<00:01:36.140> got<00:01:36.260> smudged<00:01:36.890> out<00:01:37.160> so<00:01:37.970> in<00:01:38.120> a

00:01:38.140 --> 00:01:38.150 
and everything got smudged out so in a

00:01:38.150 --> 00:01:40.270 
and everything got smudged out so in a
normal<00:01:38.630> case<00:01:39.020> I<00:01:39.290> would<00:01:39.530> clean<00:01:39.740> everything<00:01:40.190> up

00:01:40.270 --> 00:01:40.280 
normal case I would clean everything up

00:01:40.280 --> 00:01:41.770 
normal case I would clean everything up
real<00:01:40.460> nice<00:01:40.640> with<00:01:40.820> concealer<00:01:41.390> but<00:01:41.570> I<00:01:41.630> was<00:01:41.750> just

00:01:41.770 --> 00:01:41.780 
real nice with concealer but I was just

00:01:41.780 --> 00:01:43.750 
real nice with concealer but I was just
trying<00:01:42.140> to<00:01:42.230> get<00:01:42.380> you<00:01:42.530> to<00:01:43.160> be<00:01:43.250> able<00:01:43.310> to<00:01:43.430> see<00:01:43.610> the

00:01:43.750 --> 00:01:43.760 
trying to get you to be able to see the

00:01:43.760 --> 00:01:46.660 
trying to get you to be able to see the
colors<00:01:44.060> really<00:01:44.480> nicely<00:01:45.430> overall<00:01:46.430> I<00:01:46.460> really

00:01:46.660 --> 00:01:46.670 
colors really nicely overall I really

00:01:46.670 --> 00:01:48.130 
colors really nicely overall I really
think<00:01:47.030> these<00:01:47.150> lipsticks<00:01:47.510> are<00:01:47.720> great<00:01:47.930> I<00:01:48.080> mean

00:01:48.130 --> 00:01:48.140 
think these lipsticks are great I mean

00:01:48.140 --> 00:01:50.260 
think these lipsticks are great I mean
there<00:01:48.410> are<00:01:48.440> $3<00:01:49.070> they<00:01:49.760> are<00:01:49.940> highly

there are $3 they are highly

00:01:50.270 --> 00:01:52.390 
there are $3 they are highly
moisturizing<00:01:50.510> I<00:01:51.260> would<00:01:51.440> definitely<00:01:51.830> say<00:01:52.100> the

00:01:52.390 --> 00:01:52.400 
moisturizing I would definitely say the

00:01:52.400 --> 00:01:54.850 
moisturizing I would definitely say the
red<00:01:52.820> one<00:01:53.060> is<00:01:53.270> the<00:01:53.750> creamiest<00:01:54.200> and<00:01:54.560> the<00:01:54.680> most

00:01:54.850 --> 00:01:54.860 
red one is the creamiest and the most

00:01:54.860 --> 00:01:57.310 
red one is the creamiest and the most
moisturizing<00:01:55.370> for<00:01:56.030> some<00:01:56.210> reason<00:01:56.600> but<00:01:57.170> they

00:01:57.310 --> 00:01:57.320 
moisturizing for some reason but they

00:01:57.320 --> 00:01:58.360 
moisturizing for some reason but they
all<00:01:57.440> seem<00:01:57.710> to<00:01:57.830> have<00:01:57.950> a<00:01:57.979> really<00:01:58.130> nice

moisturizing<00:01:59.090> feel<00:01:59.390> they<00:01:59.960> don't<00:02:00.080> feel<00:02:00.290> sticky

00:02:00.700 --> 00:02:00.710 
moisturizing feel they don't feel sticky

00:02:00.710 --> 00:02:03.640 
moisturizing feel they don't feel sticky
and<00:02:00.950> they<00:02:01.040> do<00:02:01.100> last<00:02:01.520> a<00:02:01.700> long<00:02:01.910> time<00:02:02.530> when<00:02:03.530> you're
