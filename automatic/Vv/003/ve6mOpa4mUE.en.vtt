really<00:01:50.820> good<00:01:51.119> effective<00:01:51.600> series<00:01:52.020> maybe<00:01:52.740> even

00:01:52.969 --> 00:01:52.979 
really good effective series maybe even

00:01:52.979 --> 00:01:54.440 
really good effective series maybe even
better<00:01:53.189> than<00:01:53.310> that<00:01:53.520> Joe<00:01:53.729> pro<00:01:53.880> clubs<00:01:54.149> God<00:01:54.299> but

unfortunately not that many people play
it<00:03:01.050> but<00:03:01.140> that's<00:03:01.230> what<00:03:01.350> my<00:03:01.500> channel<00:03:01.709> is<00:03:01.770> based

00:03:01.940 --> 00:03:01.950 
it but that's what my channel is based

00:03:01.950 --> 00:03:03.680 
it but that's what my channel is based
around<00:03:02.100> and<00:03:02.520> that's<00:03:03.150> what<00:03:03.300> I<00:03:03.330> like<00:03:03.480> doing

00:03:03.680 --> 00:03:03.690 
around and that's what I like doing

00:03:03.690 --> 00:03:06.830 
around and that's what I like doing
anyway<00:03:05.000> another<00:03:06.000> thing<00:03:06.239> that<00:03:06.270> I'd<00:03:06.450> like<00:03:06.480> to<00:03:06.660> be

00:03:06.830 --> 00:03:06.840 
anyway another thing that I'd like to be

00:03:06.840 --> 00:03:09.170 
anyway another thing that I'd like to be
able<00:03:06.900> to<00:03:07.020> see<00:03:07.290> in<00:03:07.500> FIFA<00:03:07.830> 16<00:03:07.980> would<00:03:08.940> be<00:03:09.150> a

00:03:09.170 --> 00:03:09.180 
able to see in FIFA 16 would be a

00:03:09.180 --> 00:03:12.199 
able to see in FIFA 16 would be a
spectator<00:03:09.870> game<00:03:10.290> or<00:03:10.560> spectator<00:03:10.980> mode<00:03:11.250> it

00:03:12.199 --> 00:03:12.209 
spectator game or spectator mode it

00:03:12.209 --> 00:03:14.750 
spectator game or spectator mode it
basically<00:03:12.390> means<00:03:12.780> that<00:03:13.020> the<00:03:13.650> future<00:03:14.130> of<00:03:14.280> FIFA

00:03:14.750 --> 00:03:14.760 
basically means that the future of FIFA

00:03:14.760 --> 00:03:17.540 
basically means that the future of FIFA
in<00:03:15.090> competitive<00:03:15.720> would<00:03:16.560> be<00:03:16.770> a<00:03:16.980> lot<00:03:17.100> easier<00:03:17.130> to

00:03:17.540 --> 00:03:17.550 
in competitive would be a lot easier to

00:03:17.550 --> 00:03:19.370 
in competitive would be a lot easier to
have<00:03:17.700> like<00:03:17.880> commentators<00:03:18.450> on<00:03:18.600> basically<00:03:19.049> so

00:03:19.370 --> 00:03:19.380 
have like commentators on basically so

00:03:19.380 --> 00:03:21.530 
have like commentators on basically so
for<00:03:19.560> live<00:03:19.680> streams<00:03:20.010> and<00:03:20.280> they<00:03:20.940> say<00:03:21.090> tournament

00:03:21.530 --> 00:03:21.540 
for live streams and they say tournament

00:03:21.540 --> 00:03:23.750 
for live streams and they say tournament
to<00:03:21.630> them<00:03:21.780> in<00:03:21.900> the<00:03:21.989> far<00:03:22.170> far<00:03:22.350> future<00:03:22.489> would<00:03:23.489> have

00:03:23.750 --> 00:03:23.760 
to them in the far far future would have

00:03:23.760 --> 00:03:26.300 
to them in the far far future would have
a<00:03:24.560> spectator<00:03:25.560> mode<00:03:25.709> we<00:03:25.890> can<00:03:26.010> actually<00:03:26.100> just

00:03:26.300 --> 00:03:26.310 
a spectator mode we can actually just

00:03:26.310 --> 00:03:28.610 
a spectator mode we can actually just
click<00:03:26.730> the<00:03:26.820> game<00:03:26.940> on<00:03:27.090> a<00:03:27.150> watch<00:03:27.299> and<00:03:27.600> they'll<00:03:28.470> be

00:03:28.610 --> 00:03:28.620 
click the game on a watch and they'll be

00:03:28.620 --> 00:03:30.199 
click the game on a watch and they'll be
like<00:03:28.650> a<00:03:28.830> real<00:03:29.070> football<00:03:29.280> like<00:03:29.519> camera<00:03:29.940> angles

00:03:30.199 --> 00:03:30.209 
like a real football like camera angles

00:03:30.209 --> 00:03:32.360 
like a real football like camera angles
you<00:03:30.330> can<00:03:30.360> play<00:03:30.540> around<00:03:30.600> the<00:03:30.780> camera<00:03:31.049> angles<00:03:31.370> so

00:03:32.360 --> 00:03:32.370 
you can play around the camera angles so

00:03:32.370 --> 00:03:33.410 
you can play around the camera angles so
you<00:03:32.430> can<00:03:32.610> kind<00:03:32.820> of<00:03:32.850> do<00:03:33.000> it<00:03:33.090> like<00:03:33.209> your<00:03:33.330> own

00:03:33.410 --> 00:03:33.420 
you can kind of do it like your own

00:03:33.420 --> 00:03:35.420 
you can kind of do it like your own
broadcast<00:03:33.630> and<00:03:34.260> you<00:03:34.950> can<00:03:35.070> obviously<00:03:35.160> get

00:03:35.420 --> 00:03:35.430 
broadcast and you can obviously get

00:03:35.430 --> 00:03:36.620 
broadcast and you can obviously get
people<00:03:35.670> to<00:03:35.760> comment<00:03:35.940> over<00:03:36.299> and<00:03:36.450> I'll<00:03:36.540> make

00:03:36.620 --> 00:03:36.630 
people to comment over and I'll make

00:03:36.630 --> 00:03:38.360 
people to comment over and I'll make
live<00:03:36.810> streams<00:03:37.140> really<00:03:37.410> good<00:03:37.530> fun<00:03:37.709> especially
