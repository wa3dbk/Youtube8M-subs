00:00:03.020 --> 00:00:06.020
 d 

00:00:07.410 --> 00:00:10.410
 hello everyone today we are going to make a 

00:00:09.269 --> 00:00:12.180
 review of an accessory that has 

00:00:10.410 --> 00:00:14.039
 seemed very interesting and we have already 

00:00:12.180 --> 00:00:16.980
 analyzed also in text in our 

00:00:14.039 --> 00:00:19.860
 blog fax android dotcom and as you can see 

00:00:16.980 --> 00:00:22.020
 it's about a tdt receiver for the for a 

00:00:19.860 --> 00:00:23.760
 Android mobile that good there's always 

00:00:22.020 --> 00:00:26.130
 keep in mind that the mobile the tablet 

00:00:23.760 --> 00:00:28.470
 what jce connects must be a usb 

00:00:26.130 --> 00:00:30.330
 on-the-go sa that allows to connect 

00:00:28.470 --> 00:00:34.260
 directly with different devices 

00:00:30.330 --> 00:00:36.480
 like a usb keyboard or a pendrive was not 

00:00:34.260 --> 00:00:39.440
 a box pretty well presented as 

00:00:36.480 --> 00:00:39.440
 we can appreciate here 

00:00:39.860 --> 00:00:45.770
 coming from within everything that would be the 

00:00:43.280 --> 00:00:49.130
 own device we see that it is a skewer 

00:00:45.770 --> 00:00:50.900
 really tiny microusb we see is 

00:00:49.130 --> 00:00:53.390
 very very tiny and good , well 

00:00:50.900 --> 00:00:56.180
 hooks directly in the port 

00:00:53.390 --> 00:00:57.980
 microusb because of a mobile phone or a 

00:00:56.180 --> 00:00:59.510
 tablet in this case then we have here the 

00:00:57.980 --> 00:01:01.460
 notebook 4 

00:00:59.510 --> 00:01:04.250
 just simply plug it in and 

00:01:01.460 --> 00:01:05.600
 we could automatically receive the 

00:01:04.250 --> 00:01:08.120
 tdt signal although good would have to 

00:01:05.600 --> 00:01:12.550
 connect the antenna to the device itself 

00:01:08.120 --> 00:01:12.550
 bring us an antenna here 

00:01:16.610 --> 00:01:21.290
 an antenna and we would connect it 

00:01:18.710 --> 00:01:25.760
 directly on what is at the base of the 

00:01:21.290 --> 00:01:27.350
 tdt receiver and apart also comes with 

00:01:25.760 --> 00:01:29.660
 a rather more portable antenna for 

00:01:27.350 --> 00:01:31.370
 that's good so it's more manageable 

00:01:29.660 --> 00:01:32.740
 to take the time then to make trips 

00:01:31.370 --> 00:01:36.320
 for example and to be in movement 

00:01:32.740 --> 00:01:39.200
 that connects directly see the 

00:01:36.320 --> 00:01:41.390
 antenna pad and Well suffice 

00:01:39.200 --> 00:01:44.810
 turn on the television and automatically 

00:01:41.390 --> 00:01:48.729
 the Android itself would tear the 

00:01:44.810 --> 00:01:48.729
 proper application 

00:01:48.920 --> 00:01:52.520
 we would have here we can see from 

00:01:50.990 --> 00:01:54.500
 the different channels we have already done 

00:01:52.520 --> 00:01:56.330
 a tuning and good then 

00:01:54.500 --> 00:01:57.930
 simply because we can click on 

00:01:56.330 --> 00:02:01.910
 one 

00:01:57.930 --> 00:02:01.910
 we would see the horizontal format 

00:02:10.100 --> 00:02:16.230
 We have time shifting function for 

00:02:12.080 --> 00:02:19.760
 pause directly in the reproduction 

00:02:16.230 --> 00:02:19.760
 being able to return to a point 

00:02:22.330 --> 00:02:26.640
 or if no return again to broadcast 

00:02:24.940 --> 00:02:30.990
 real time 

00:02:26.640 --> 00:02:32.910
 we could also record the broadcast 

00:02:30.990 --> 00:02:34.800
 and well, we would create different 

00:02:32.910 --> 00:02:37.410
 video files that after then 

00:02:34.800 --> 00:02:38.850
 we could also share and have 

00:02:37.410 --> 00:02:42.920
 Well, our series recorded by 

00:02:38.850 --> 00:02:42.920
 very practical example 

00:02:42.950 --> 00:02:49.489
 we use it we go back the menu again 

00:02:46.099 --> 00:02:51.739
 previous we go back and we see that 

00:02:49.489 --> 00:02:52.940
 we have different recordings that 

00:02:51.739 --> 00:02:55.250
 we have been doing so much to the 

00:02:52.940 --> 00:02:56.959
 different from tests as well as the 

00:02:55.250 --> 00:02:58.879
 what we have done now we see that no 

00:02:56.959 --> 00:03:02.180
 it only marks the recording but 

00:02:58.879 --> 00:03:04.250
 also select the nosa and apply 

00:03:02.180 --> 00:03:06.800
 directly programming by the pc 

00:03:04.250 --> 00:03:10.750
 that was in effect creating us a 

00:03:06.800 --> 00:03:10.750
 video file we reproduce 

00:03:16.330 --> 00:03:21.300
 and we will have our video to see 

00:03:25.870 --> 00:03:30.069
 just give it to a channel and 

00:03:27.730 --> 00:03:31.840
 automatically reproduce therefore what 

00:03:30.069 --> 00:03:33.489
 is being broadcast at that time we have 

00:03:31.840 --> 00:03:36.940
 to keep in mind that good when treated 

00:03:33.489 --> 00:03:39.760
 of a tdt receiver not because it would not pull 

00:03:36.940 --> 00:03:42.129
 our data connection and well then 

00:03:39.760 --> 00:03:43.840
 we should be an ace in a place where 

00:03:42.129 --> 00:03:46.269
 we receive the signal sufficiently well 

00:03:43.840 --> 00:03:47.950
 of television because not working well 

00:03:46.269 --> 00:03:49.480
 with all the channels with all the 

00:03:47.950 --> 00:03:51.310
 frequencies and good then from time to time 

00:03:49.480 --> 00:03:53.620
 when jumping the typical jumps in 

00:03:51.310 --> 00:03:55.510
 the emissions well then that also 

00:03:53.620 --> 00:03:58.680
 you can have directly the 

00:03:55.510 --> 00:03:58.680
 home receiver 

00:04:13.260 --> 00:04:18.880
 sometimes it can slow down depending 

00:04:16.090 --> 00:04:20.680
 mission and also how well 

00:04:18.880 --> 00:04:22.150
 the signal is being received in that 

00:04:20.680 --> 00:04:24.640
 moment we see here the signal receiver 

00:04:22.150 --> 00:04:27.310
 that we need a room something 

00:04:24.640 --> 00:04:29.320
 hidden and does not get overly 

00:04:27.310 --> 00:04:31.540
 ok the television signal though 

00:04:29.320 --> 00:04:34.140
 we could always change the antenna and 

00:04:31.540 --> 00:04:34.140
 as we will see 

00:04:34.599 --> 00:04:41.620
 with this whole in theory should 

00:04:37.219 --> 00:04:41.620
 receive much better the signal e italy 

00:04:42.920 --> 00:04:48.770
 we see that the signal has improved at the time 

00:04:46.130 --> 00:04:51.980
 to move because it is not as practical as 

00:04:48.770 --> 00:04:53.570
 it could be this piece of cable that 

00:04:51.980 --> 00:04:54.860
 just plug in or directly and 

00:04:53.570 --> 00:04:57.070
 we could be seeing the 

00:04:54.860 --> 00:04:57.070
 TV 

00:04:57.390 --> 00:05:02.940
 and apart from the possibility of seeing then 

00:05:01.740 --> 00:05:05.070
 the different channels also 

00:05:02.940 --> 00:05:07.230
 we would have the options of the 

00:05:05.070 --> 00:05:10.410
 tdt as for example then change 

00:05:07.230 --> 00:05:12.860
 those emissions that allow it to its 

00:05:10.410 --> 00:05:12.860
 original version 

00:05:13.580 --> 00:05:17.300
 subtitles and that would not have 

00:05:15.830 --> 00:05:19.060
 compatibility with them but good 

00:05:17.300 --> 00:05:20.830
 it would be a lesser evil 

00:05:19.060 --> 00:05:22.600
 and well, we will also have 

00:05:20.830 --> 00:05:24.750
 different video formats for 

00:05:22.600 --> 00:05:26.880
 to adapt 

00:05:24.750 --> 00:05:29.490
 to the broadcast and to our screen 

00:05:26.880 --> 00:05:31.319
 phone or tablet 

00:05:29.490 --> 00:05:34.080
 We hope you liked this 

00:05:31.319 --> 00:05:35.009
 small review of an accessory for 

00:05:34.080 --> 00:05:37.680
 watch television that we liked 

00:05:35.009 --> 00:05:39.870
 much hope that you also read the 

00:05:37.680 --> 00:05:43.789
 analysis that is already published in text 

00:05:39.870 --> 00:05:43.789
 in dotcom fax and see you later
