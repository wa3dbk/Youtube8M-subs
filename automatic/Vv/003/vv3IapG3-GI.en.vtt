00:00:24.019 --> 00:00:29.960
 here they look, we mean the opposite 

00:00:27.589 --> 00:00:32.300
 the paths were thought to drive and 

00:00:29.960 --> 00:00:36.859
 show a couple quarter to not 

00:00:32.300 --> 00:00:39.829
 dusty and crushed by traffic 19 street 

00:00:36.859 --> 00:00:43.070
 and we are somewhere towards the deviate's 

00:00:39.829 --> 00:00:45.260
 you look outside so residential 

00:00:43.070 --> 00:00:50.649
 quarters which in itself is quite good and 

00:00:45.260 --> 00:00:56.179
 will give you a better view of the city 

00:00:50.649 --> 00:01:01.159
 so there we have what is the turn 

00:00:56.179 --> 00:01:08.510
 right and let's go there again this area 

00:01:01.159 --> 00:01:11.470

00:01:14.710 --> 00:01:31.420
 ways are you further on the ocean here and now 

00:01:27.370 --> 00:01:36.310
 turn off the street and that's how it all 

00:01:31.420 --> 00:01:37.030
 looks like friends 

00:01:36.310 --> 00:01:39.970

00:01:37.030 --> 00:01:42.730
 here are the houses look it all 

00:01:39.970 --> 00:01:44.830
 can say such a private sector there 

00:01:42.730 --> 00:01:49.290
 dourik see there about two floors there 

00:01:44.830 --> 00:01:54.729
 houses on one floor on the first floor 

00:01:49.290 --> 00:01:58.000
 there all go to the garage and often near 

00:01:54.729 --> 00:02:04.810
 There is such a room in this garage 

00:01:58.000 --> 00:02:06.940
 how would I often rent a studio so they 

00:02:04.810 --> 00:02:09.810
 tiny ones there with almost no 

00:02:06.940 --> 00:02:15.070
 conveniences such familiar well 

00:02:09.810 --> 00:02:17.860
 modestly ordinary one at this stage 

00:02:15.070 --> 00:02:20.350
 cousin I'm a little adapted then 

00:02:17.860 --> 00:02:23.230
 there is, as it were, an idea I am allowed 

00:02:20.350 --> 00:02:25.000
 disrupt and someone to settle but look 

00:02:23.230 --> 00:02:28.450
 through your fingers so this is such 

00:02:25.000 --> 00:02:30.880
 as if the usual form of earnings so it 

00:02:28.450 --> 00:02:34.540
 equip room behind the garage and this 

00:02:30.880 --> 00:02:35.440
 part of the garage and so on so that you don't 

00:02:34.540 --> 00:02:39.360
 it seemed that 

00:02:35.440 --> 00:02:39.360

00:03:08.950 --> 00:03:15.280
 you can say so who own 

00:03:11.110 --> 00:03:18.690
