00:03:26.479 --> 00:03:26.489 
feel which I really liked the only

00:03:26.489 --> 00:03:28.069 
feel which I really liked the only

00:03:28.069 --> 00:03:28.079 
problem is that sometimes you cannot be

00:03:28.079 --> 00:03:29.509 
problem is that sometimes you cannot be
sure<00:03:28.109> which<00:03:28.500> gadget<00:03:28.859> you're<00:03:28.980> supposed<00:03:29.310> to<00:03:29.430> be

00:03:31.759 --> 00:03:31.769 
using this can easily be solved though

00:03:31.769 --> 00:03:33.289 
using this can easily be solved though
by<00:03:31.950> using<00:03:32.160> the<00:03:32.340> gadget<00:03:32.730> that<00:03:32.819> acts<00:03:33.060> like<00:03:33.180> a

00:03:33.289 --> 00:03:33.299 
by using the gadget that acts like a

00:03:33.299 --> 00:03:35.240 
by using the gadget that acts like a
scanning<00:03:33.720> tool<00:03:33.959> sometimes<00:03:34.500> it<00:03:34.889> does<00:03:35.010> feel

00:03:35.240 --> 00:03:35.250 
scanning tool sometimes it does feel

00:03:35.250 --> 00:03:37.280 
scanning tool sometimes it does feel
like<00:03:35.370> you<00:03:35.489> have<00:03:35.639> to<00:03:35.669> use<00:03:35.940> it<00:03:35.970> too<00:03:36.269> much<00:03:36.299> but<00:03:37.109> the

00:03:37.280 --> 00:03:37.290 
like you have to use it too much but the

00:03:37.290 --> 00:03:38.659 
like you have to use it too much but the
good<00:03:37.440> thing<00:03:37.470> about<00:03:37.680> getting<00:03:38.040> to<00:03:38.340> use<00:03:38.519> this

00:03:38.659 --> 00:03:38.669 
good thing about getting to use this

00:03:38.669 --> 00:03:39.949 
good thing about getting to use this
tool<00:03:38.940> is<00:03:38.970> that<00:03:39.090> sometimes<00:03:39.599> you'll<00:03:39.840> be

00:03:39.949 --> 00:03:39.959 
tool is that sometimes you'll be

tool is that sometimes you'll be
rewarded<00:03:40.109> by<00:03:40.530> finding<00:03:40.859> a<00:03:40.980> secret<00:03:41.340> area<00:03:41.700> this

00:03:42.289 --> 00:03:42.299 
rewarded by finding a secret area this

00:03:42.299 --> 00:03:44.030 
rewarded by finding a secret area this
will<00:03:42.510> also<00:03:42.660> encourage<00:03:43.169> you<00:03:43.440> to<00:03:43.590> explore<00:03:43.889> the

design fault when you consider that the

00:05:00.270 --> 00:05:01.760 
design fault when you consider that the
