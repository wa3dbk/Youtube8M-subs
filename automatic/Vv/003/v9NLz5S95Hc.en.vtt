progressions<00:03:25.980> but<00:03:26.040> a<00:03:26.160> lot<00:03:26.400> of<00:03:26.430> the<00:03:26.610> times<00:03:26.850> it

00:03:26.960 --> 00:03:26.970 
progressions but a lot of the times it

00:03:26.970 --> 00:03:28.729 
progressions but a lot of the times it
seems<00:03:27.150> like<00:03:27.299> he<00:03:27.420> did<00:03:27.540> have<00:03:27.720> trouble<00:03:28.049> reading

00:03:28.729 --> 00:03:28.739 
seems like he did have trouble reading

00:03:28.739 --> 00:03:30.860 
seems like he did have trouble reading
opposing<00:03:29.370> defenses<00:03:29.910> making<00:03:30.570> good<00:03:30.750> decisions

00:03:30.860 --> 00:03:30.870 
opposing defenses making good decisions

00:03:30.870 --> 00:03:33.949 
opposing defenses making good decisions
and<00:03:31.500> going<00:03:32.459> through<00:03:32.670> his<00:03:32.850> progressions<00:03:33.510> one

00:03:33.949 --> 00:03:33.959 
and going through his progressions one

00:03:33.959 --> 00:03:36.020 
and going through his progressions one
read<00:03:34.230> and<00:03:34.560> that's<00:03:34.739> it<00:03:35.040> you<00:03:35.190> stick<00:03:35.489> to<00:03:35.700> it<00:03:35.730> and

00:03:36.020 --> 00:03:36.030 
read and that's it you stick to it and

00:03:36.030 --> 00:03:39.020 
read and that's it you stick to it and
then<00:03:36.120> you<00:03:36.390> go<00:03:36.680> he<00:03:37.680> has<00:03:37.799> a<00:03:37.830> lot<00:03:38.190> of<00:03:38.220> work<00:03:38.549> to<00:03:38.820> do

00:03:39.020 --> 00:03:39.030 
then you go he has a lot of work to do

00:03:39.030 --> 00:03:42.199 
then you go he has a lot of work to do

00:04:02.330 --> 00:04:02.340 
weak indeed he looks like a seventh

00:04:02.340 --> 00:04:05.900 
weak indeed he looks like a seventh
round<00:04:02.430> pick<00:04:03.110> overall<00:04:04.110> if<00:04:04.709> I<00:04:04.980> was<00:04:05.220> drafting<00:04:05.790> I

round pick overall if I was drafting I

00:04:05.910 --> 00:04:07.610 
round pick overall if I was drafting I
would<00:04:06.060> probably<00:04:06.239> be<00:04:06.600> looking<00:04:06.810> at<00:04:07.140> drafting

00:04:07.610 --> 00:04:07.620 
would probably be looking at drafting

00:04:07.620 --> 00:04:09.170 
would probably be looking at drafting
Logan<00:04:07.950> Thomas<00:04:08.100> somewhere<00:04:08.640> around<00:04:08.820> the<00:04:08.910> fourth

Logan Thomas somewhere around the fourth

Logan Thomas somewhere around the fourth
round<00:04:09.420> and<00:04:09.600> here's<00:04:09.780> why<00:04:10.019> because<00:04:10.489> ultimately

00:04:11.479 --> 00:04:11.489 
round and here's why because ultimately

00:04:11.489 --> 00:04:13.430 
round and here's why because ultimately
when<00:04:12.329> you<00:04:12.420> get<00:04:12.600> to<00:04:12.720> that<00:04:12.840> portion<00:04:13.140> of<00:04:13.380> the

trying to find a guy that in two or
three<00:05:18.120> years<00:05:18.330> could<00:05:18.990> potentially<00:05:19.410> be<00:05:19.530> a

three years could potentially be a

three years could potentially be a
difference<00:05:20.010> maker<00:05:20.070> for<00:05:20.460> me<00:05:20.610> Logan<00:05:21.360> Thomas

00:05:21.530 --> 00:05:21.540 
difference maker for me Logan Thomas

00:05:21.540 --> 00:05:24.200 
difference maker for me Logan Thomas
could<00:05:21.870> be<00:05:22.020> that<00:05:22.230> now<00:05:22.890> he<00:05:22.950> can<00:05:23.280> also<00:05:23.460> flop<00:05:23.970> out

00:05:24.200 --> 00:05:24.210 
could be that now he can also flop out

00:05:24.210 --> 00:05:26.540 
could be that now he can also flop out
miserably<00:05:24.870> as<00:05:25.080> an<00:05:25.230> NFL<00:05:25.590> quarterback<00:05:25.980> and

00:05:26.540 --> 00:05:26.550 
miserably as an NFL quarterback and

00:05:26.550 --> 00:05:28.580 
miserably as an NFL quarterback and
that's<00:05:27.060> fine<00:05:27.330> because<00:05:27.600> again<00:05:28.140> if<00:05:28.320> I'm<00:05:28.440> looking

00:05:28.580 --> 00:05:28.590 
that's fine because again if I'm looking

00:05:28.590 --> 00:05:30.500 
that's fine because again if I'm looking
at<00:05:28.860> it<00:05:28.920> as<00:05:29.130> a<00:05:29.160> fourth<00:05:29.460> run<00:05:29.700> if<00:05:29.910> this<00:05:30.240> kid

00:05:36.770 --> 00:05:36.780 
kid could play outside linebacker this

00:05:36.780 --> 00:05:39.110 
kid could play outside linebacker this
kid<00:05:37.110> could<00:05:37.260> play<00:05:37.290> tight<00:05:37.770> in<00:05:38.010> but<00:05:38.430> I<00:05:38.460> am<00:05:38.700> still

00:05:39.110 --> 00:05:39.120 
kid could play tight in but I am still

00:05:39.120 --> 00:05:42.260 
kid could play tight in but I am still
drafting<00:05:39.840> him<00:05:40.080> to<00:05:40.620> be<00:05:40.800> a<00:05:41.010> quarterback<00:05:41.550> first

00:05:42.260 --> 00:05:42.270 
drafting him to be a quarterback first

00:05:42.270 --> 00:05:44.690 
drafting him to be a quarterback first
it's<00:05:42.720> just<00:05:43.110> it<00:05:43.470> makes<00:05:43.830> me<00:05:44.040> feel<00:05:44.250> that<00:05:44.460> much

00:05:44.690 --> 00:05:44.700 
it's just it makes me feel that much

00:05:44.700 --> 00:05:47.000 
it's just it makes me feel that much
more<00:05:45.030> at<00:05:45.240> ease<00:05:45.390> if<00:05:45.780> I<00:05:45.960> take<00:05:46.230> this<00:05:46.470> kid<00:05:46.800> with<00:05:46.980> a

00:05:47.000 --> 00:05:47.010 
more at ease if I take this kid with a

00:05:47.010 --> 00:05:49.430 
more at ease if I take this kid with a
fourth<00:05:47.340> round<00:05:47.580> pick<00:05:47.730> let's<00:05:48.150> say<00:05:48.420> because<00:05:48.960> I

00:05:49.430 --> 00:05:49.440 
fourth round pick let's say because I

00:05:49.440 --> 00:05:50.870 
fourth round pick let's say because I
feel<00:05:49.680> like<00:05:49.710> he<00:05:50.070> could<00:05:50.220> be<00:05:50.250> a<00:05:50.340> football<00:05:50.850> player

00:05:50.870 --> 00:05:50.880

00:05:50.880 --> 00:05:54.080 
feel like he could be a football player
somewhere<00:05:51.690> but<00:05:52.080> I<00:05:52.110> still<00:05:52.530> feel<00:05:52.860> like<00:05:53.190> his<00:05:53.640> best

00:05:54.080 --> 00:05:54.090 
somewhere but I still feel like his best

00:05:54.090 --> 00:05:57.110 
somewhere but I still feel like his best
chance<00:05:54.240> to<00:05:54.720> make<00:05:55.080> it<00:05:55.230> in<00:05:55.380> the<00:05:55.470> NFL<00:05:55.710> long<00:05:56.640> term

chance to make it in the NFL long term

00:05:57.120 --> 00:06:00.560 
chance to make it in the NFL long term
is<00:05:57.360> as<00:05:58.020> a<00:05:58.350> quarterback<00:05:59.250> that<00:05:59.880> arm<00:06:00.210> strength

00:06:00.560 --> 00:06:00.570 
is as a quarterback that arm strength

a half and I kind of vacillated in terms

00:06:16.850 --> 00:06:16.860 
of who I was going to compare him to

00:06:16.860 --> 00:06:18.230 
of who I was going to compare him to
there<00:06:17.310> are<00:06:17.400> a<00:06:17.430> couple<00:06:17.550> of<00:06:17.730> different<00:06:18.090> guys

00:06:18.230 --> 00:06:18.240 
there are a couple of different guys

00:06:18.240 --> 00:06:19.820 
there are a couple of different guys
that<00:06:18.270> I<00:06:18.570> looked<00:06:18.780> at<00:06:18.900> and<00:06:19.020> I<00:06:19.050> said<00:06:19.230> yeah<00:06:19.410> I<00:06:19.440> could

00:06:19.820 --> 00:06:19.830 
that I looked at and I said yeah I could

00:06:19.830 --> 00:06:21.470 
that I looked at and I said yeah I could
see<00:06:20.010> some<00:06:20.250> of<00:06:20.280> that<00:06:20.370> in<00:06:20.520> him<00:06:20.790> guys<00:06:20.970> like<00:06:21.180> EJ

00:06:21.470 --> 00:06:21.480 
see some of that in him guys like EJ

00:06:21.480 --> 00:06:22.820 
see some of that in him guys like EJ
Manuel<00:06:21.660> on<00:06:21.870> the<00:06:21.960> like<00:06:22.110> but<00:06:22.440> I<00:06:22.530> think<00:06:22.740> the

00:06:22.820 --> 00:06:22.830 
Manuel on the like but I think the

00:06:22.830 --> 00:06:24.440 
Manuel on the like but I think the
closest<00:06:23.400> comparison<00:06:23.730> would<00:06:24.060> be<00:06:24.120> somebody

00:06:24.440 --> 00:06:24.450 
closest comparison would be somebody

00:06:24.450 --> 00:06:25.460 
closest comparison would be somebody
like<00:06:24.600> a<00:06:24.750> terrelle<00:06:25.110> pryor

00:06:25.460 --> 00:06:25.470
