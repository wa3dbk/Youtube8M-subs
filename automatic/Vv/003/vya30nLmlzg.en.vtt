00:02:27.400 --> 00:02:27.410 
a transform scale you know what no I

00:02:27.410 --> 00:02:28.540 
a transform scale you know what no I
can't

00:02:28.540 --> 00:02:28.550 
can't

00:02:28.550 --> 00:02:31.030

brings<00:04:53.650> in<00:04:54.220> a<00:04:54.460> clone<00:04:55.330> source<00:04:55.600> okay

00:04:57.140 --> 00:04:57.150 
brings in a clone source okay

00:04:57.150 --> 00:04:59.460 
brings in a clone source okay
nothing<00:04:58.150> in<00:04:58.270> the<00:04:58.360> clone<00:04:58.600> source<00:04:58.840> it's<00:04:59.200> just

00:04:59.460 --> 00:04:59.470 
nothing in the clone source it's just

00:04:59.470 --> 00:05:01.620 
nothing in the clone source it's just
like<00:04:59.770> that's<00:05:00.190> fine<00:05:00.580> we<00:05:01.030> don't<00:05:01.180> have<00:05:01.270> to<00:05:01.420> worry

00:05:03.840 --> 00:05:03.850 
about it but what it does do is it's

00:05:03.850 --> 00:05:06.870 
about it but what it does do is it's
creates<00:05:04.390> the<00:05:04.810> ability<00:05:05.380> for<00:05:05.410> us<00:05:05.890> to<00:05:05.920> see<00:05:06.640> a

00:05:06.870 --> 00:05:06.880 
creates the ability for us to see a

00:05:06.880 --> 00:05:09.960 
creates the ability for us to see a
clone<00:05:07.440> okay<00:05:08.440> so<00:05:08.500> let's<00:05:08.860> talk<00:05:09.400> about<00:05:09.610> how<00:05:09.820> we're

00:05:09.960 --> 00:05:09.970 
clone okay so let's talk about how we're

00:05:09.970 --> 00:05:11.460 
clone okay so let's talk about how we're
going<00:05:10.060> to<00:05:10.150> do<00:05:10.300> it<00:05:10.360> we'll<00:05:10.540> come<00:05:10.750> over<00:05:10.930> here<00:05:11.290> to

00:05:11.460 --> 00:05:11.470 
going to do it we'll come over here to

00:05:11.470 --> 00:05:14.520 
going to do it we'll come over here to
this<00:05:11.590> top<00:05:12.400> stack<00:05:12.820> we'll<00:05:13.210> open<00:05:13.450> that<00:05:13.930> up<00:05:13.990> and

00:05:14.520 --> 00:05:14.530 
this top stack we'll open that up and

00:05:14.530 --> 00:05:17.250 
this top stack we'll open that up and
that's<00:05:14.770> where<00:05:15.100> we<00:05:15.250> want<00:05:15.460> to<00:05:15.520> start<00:05:15.820> and<00:05:16.510> so<00:05:17.110> all

sort<00:05:49.540> of<00:05:49.690> messes<00:05:50.169> with<00:05:50.380> the<00:05:50.610> original<00:05:51.610> image

00:05:52.080 --> 00:05:52.090 
sort of messes with the original image

00:05:52.090 --> 00:05:54.659 
sort of messes with the original image
if<00:05:52.300> you<00:05:52.330> bring<00:05:53.169> it<00:05:53.290> down<00:05:53.500> because<00:05:54.370> remember

00:05:57.780 --> 00:05:57.790 
it's it is the clone source so we bring

00:05:57.790 --> 00:06:00.210 
it's it is the clone source so we bring
this<00:05:58.090> over<00:05:58.450> a<00:05:58.690> little<00:05:58.960> bit<00:05:59.169> based<00:05:59.500> on<00:05:59.770> being

00:06:00.210 --> 00:06:00.220 
this over a little bit based on being

00:06:00.220 --> 00:06:04.409 
this over a little bit based on being
able<00:06:00.400> to<00:06:00.610> see<00:06:00.880> the<00:06:02.610> tracing<00:06:03.610> paper<00:06:03.640> under

00:06:04.409 --> 00:06:04.419 
able to see the tracing paper under

00:06:04.419 --> 00:06:09.440 
able to see the tracing paper under
neath<00:06:04.990> and<00:06:06.390> we<00:06:07.390> are<00:06:08.020> all<00:06:08.200> set<00:06:08.470> up<00:06:08.530> to<00:06:08.950> go

00:06:09.440 --> 00:06:09.450 
neath and we are all set up to go

00:06:09.450 --> 00:06:13.620 
neath and we are all set up to go
another<00:06:10.450> step<00:06:11.050> and<00:06:11.680> when<00:06:12.610> we<00:06:12.730> turn<00:06:13.060> that<00:06:13.390> off

00:06:13.620 --> 00:06:13.630 
another step and when we turn that off

00:06:13.630 --> 00:06:16.230 
another step and when we turn that off
you'll<00:06:14.410> see<00:06:14.740> that<00:06:14.980> it<00:06:15.130> leaves<00:06:15.400> the<00:06:15.760> tracing

00:06:16.230 --> 00:06:16.240 
you'll see that it leaves the tracing

00:06:16.240 --> 00:06:19.080 
you'll see that it leaves the tracing
paper<00:06:16.480> or<00:06:16.930> the<00:06:17.110> onion<00:06:17.410> skin<00:06:17.980> sorry<00:06:18.760> I<00:06:18.850> keep

00:06:19.080 --> 00:06:19.090 
paper or the onion skin sorry I keep

00:06:19.090 --> 00:06:21.200 
paper or the onion skin sorry I keep
calling<00:06:19.330> tracing<00:06:19.870> paper<00:06:20.020> because<00:06:20.500> I<00:06:20.650> am

00:06:21.200 --> 00:06:21.210 
calling tracing paper because I am

00:06:21.210 --> 00:06:24.300 
calling tracing paper because I am
setting<00:06:22.210> it<00:06:22.300> up<00:06:22.419> in<00:06:22.600> the<00:06:22.690> tracing<00:06:23.110> paper<00:06:23.310> but

00:06:24.300 --> 00:06:24.310 
setting it up in the tracing paper but

00:06:24.310 --> 00:06:27.030 
setting it up in the tracing paper but
it<00:06:24.520> is<00:06:24.700> a<00:06:24.940> way<00:06:25.240> to<00:06:25.270> onion<00:06:25.870> skin<00:06:26.200> okay<00:06:26.800> so<00:06:26.860> we

00:06:27.030 --> 00:06:27.040 
it is a way to onion skin okay so we

00:06:27.040 --> 00:06:29.909 
it is a way to onion skin okay so we
bring<00:06:27.280> down<00:06:27.460> to<00:06:27.730> the<00:06:27.760> bottom<00:06:28.390> one<00:06:28.570> we<00:06:29.290> turn<00:06:29.590> it

00:06:29.909 --> 00:06:29.919 
bring down to the bottom one we turn it

00:06:29.919 --> 00:06:34.250 
bring down to the bottom one we turn it
on<00:06:29.950> we<00:06:30.640> move<00:06:31.419> it<00:06:31.810> out<00:06:32.230> a<00:06:32.560> little<00:06:32.710> bit<00:06:32.919> and

00:06:34.250 --> 00:06:34.260 
on we move it out a little bit and

00:06:34.260 --> 00:06:37.980 
on we move it out a little bit and
forward<00:06:35.430> turn<00:06:36.430> it<00:06:36.580> off

00:06:37.980 --> 00:06:37.990 
forward turn it off

00:06:37.990 --> 00:06:41.760 
forward turn it off
come<00:06:38.140> back<00:06:38.380> up<00:06:38.440> to<00:06:38.950> this<00:06:39.160> one<00:06:39.490> turn<00:06:39.880> it<00:06:40.060> on<00:06:40.770> move

00:06:41.760 --> 00:06:41.770 
come back up to this one turn it on move

00:06:41.770 --> 00:06:44.370 
come back up to this one turn it on move
it<00:06:42.130> forward<00:06:42.820> and<00:06:43.150> I<00:06:43.390> could<00:06:43.600> kind<00:06:43.900> of<00:06:43.990> look

00:06:44.370 --> 00:06:44.380

00:06:48.210 --> 00:06:48.220 
down a little bit I was beginning to go

00:06:48.220 --> 00:06:55.170 
down a little bit I was beginning to go
up<00:06:48.490> and<00:06:50.520> we<00:06:51.520> go<00:06:52.390> forward<00:06:52.930> one<00:06:53.290> more<00:06:53.320> and<00:06:54.000> we<00:06:55.000> go

00:06:55.170 --> 00:06:55.180 
up and we go forward one more and we go

00:06:55.180 --> 00:06:59.010 
up and we go forward one more and we go
up<00:06:55.470> turn<00:06:56.470> that<00:06:56.680> one<00:06:56.860> off<00:06:57.040> and<00:06:57.670> we<00:06:58.210> go<00:06:58.390> up<00:06:58.420> to<00:06:58.660> the

00:06:59.010 --> 00:06:59.020 
up turn that one off and we go up to the

00:06:59.020 --> 00:07:04.580 
up turn that one off and we go up to the
next<00:06:59.260> one<00:06:59.560> turn<00:06:59.890> it<00:07:00.040> on<00:07:00.630> we<00:07:02.010> move<00:07:03.010> it<00:07:03.250> forward

00:07:04.580 --> 00:07:04.590 
next one turn it on we move it forward

00:07:04.590 --> 00:07:08.880 
next one turn it on we move it forward
where<00:07:05.590> it<00:07:05.680> needs<00:07:05.890> to<00:07:06.190> be<00:07:07.050> then<00:07:08.050> we<00:07:08.170> go<00:07:08.350> forward
