so<00:00:00.930> here<00:00:01.230> is<00:00:01.380> the<00:00:01.589> lid<00:00:01.800> to<00:00:02.100> the<00:00:02.220> washer<00:00:02.700> I<00:00:02.909> took

00:00:03.649 --> 00:00:03.659 
so here is the lid to the washer I took

00:00:03.659 --> 00:00:05.390 
so here is the lid to the washer I took
it<00:00:03.810> off<00:00:03.929> because<00:00:04.110> it's<00:00:04.319> got<00:00:04.500> the<00:00:04.620> glass<00:00:04.859> in<00:00:05.190> it

00:00:05.390 --> 00:00:05.400 
it off because it's got the glass in it

00:00:05.400 --> 00:00:09.640 
it off because it's got the glass in it
I<00:00:05.580> didn't<00:00:06.089> want<00:00:06.299> it<00:00:06.390> to<00:00:06.770> get<00:00:07.770> broken<00:00:08.400> and

00:00:09.640 --> 00:00:09.650 
I didn't want it to get broken and

00:00:09.650 --> 00:00:12.330 
I didn't want it to get broken and
there's<00:00:10.650> two<00:00:10.860> clips

00:00:12.330 --> 00:00:12.340 
there's two clips

00:00:12.340 --> 00:00:14.790 
there's two clips
about<00:00:12.850> six<00:00:13.150> inches<00:00:13.390> from<00:00:13.600> the<00:00:13.780> from<00:00:14.680> the

00:00:14.790 --> 00:00:14.800 
about six inches from the from the

00:00:14.800 --> 00:00:17.820 
about six inches from the from the
corner<00:00:15.160> over<00:00:15.430> to<00:00:15.700> here<00:00:16.000> and<00:00:16.470> one<00:00:17.470> on<00:00:17.590> the<00:00:17.710> other

00:00:17.820 --> 00:00:17.830 
corner over to here and one on the other

00:00:17.830 --> 00:00:20.460 
corner over to here and one on the other
side<00:00:17.980> and<00:00:18.970> it<00:00:19.090> takes<00:00:19.300> a<00:00:19.450> fair<00:00:20.110> amount<00:00:20.170> of

00:00:20.460 --> 00:00:20.470 
side and it takes a fair amount of

00:00:20.470 --> 00:00:22.679 
side and it takes a fair amount of
pressure<00:00:20.680> to<00:00:20.830> push<00:00:21.099> on<00:00:21.279> these<00:00:21.460> and<00:00:22.420> then<00:00:22.540> as

00:00:22.679 --> 00:00:22.689 
pressure to push on these and then as

00:00:22.689 --> 00:00:25.050 
pressure to push on these and then as
you<00:00:22.840> can<00:00:22.990> see<00:00:23.170> the<00:00:23.410> lid<00:00:23.650> just<00:00:23.680> scents<00:00:24.250> out<00:00:24.400> and

00:00:25.050 --> 00:00:25.060 
you can see the lid just scents out and

00:00:25.060 --> 00:00:28.290 
you can see the lid just scents out and
that's<00:00:25.330> why<00:00:25.509> I<00:00:25.540> took<00:00:25.630> the<00:00:26.790> more<00:00:27.790> the<00:00:27.880> top<00:00:28.119> I

00:00:28.290 --> 00:00:28.300 
that's why I took the more the top I

00:00:28.300 --> 00:00:30.180 
that's why I took the more the top I
should<00:00:28.480> say<00:00:28.630> sits<00:00:28.900> up<00:00:29.050> the<00:00:29.199> lid<00:00:29.380> I<00:00:29.410> took<00:00:29.980> off

00:00:30.180 --> 00:00:30.190 
should say sits up the lid I took off

00:00:30.190 --> 00:00:32.549 
should say sits up the lid I took off
just<00:00:30.520> so<00:00:31.119> it<00:00:31.210> wouldn't<00:00:31.449> go<00:00:31.539> flipping<00:00:32.020> over

00:00:32.549 --> 00:00:32.559 
just so it wouldn't go flipping over

00:00:32.559 --> 00:00:36.689 
just so it wouldn't go flipping over
anyways<00:00:33.370> will<00:00:34.300> cause<00:00:34.510> the<00:00:34.750> problem<00:00:35.610> first<00:00:36.610> of

00:00:36.689 --> 00:00:36.699 
anyways will cause the problem first of

00:00:36.699 --> 00:00:38.040 
anyways will cause the problem first of
all<00:00:36.820> what's<00:00:36.970> kind<00:00:37.180> of<00:00:37.210> cool<00:00:37.420> is<00:00:37.480> this<00:00:37.780> thing

00:00:38.040 --> 00:00:38.050 
all what's kind of cool is this thing

00:00:38.050 --> 00:00:42.450 
all what's kind of cool is this thing
actually<00:00:38.860> suspended<00:00:39.820> on<00:00:40.600> cables<00:00:41.460> suspends

00:00:42.450 --> 00:00:42.460 
actually suspended on cables suspends

00:00:42.460 --> 00:00:44.660 
actually suspended on cables suspends
right<00:00:42.610> there<00:00:42.850> if<00:00:43.420> you<00:00:43.600> look<00:00:43.780> down<00:00:43.960> you<00:00:44.230> can<00:00:44.410> see

00:00:44.660 --> 00:00:44.670 
right there if you look down you can see

00:00:44.670 --> 00:00:48.569 
right there if you look down you can see
get<00:00:45.670> a<00:00:45.700> flashlight<00:00:46.059> so<00:00:46.410> you<00:00:47.410> can<00:00:47.620> get<00:00:48.130> an<00:00:48.250> idea

00:00:48.569 --> 00:00:48.579 
get a flashlight so you can get an idea

00:00:48.579 --> 00:00:55.639 
get a flashlight so you can get an idea
of<00:00:48.930> how<00:00:49.930> it<00:00:50.079> works<00:00:52.980> see<00:00:53.980> it<00:00:54.070> actually

00:00:55.639 --> 00:00:55.649 
of how it works see it actually

00:00:55.649 --> 00:00:58.680 
of how it works see it actually
suspended<00:00:56.760> by<00:00:57.760> the<00:00:57.879> way<00:00:58.000> that's<00:00:58.329> why<00:00:58.510> that

00:00:58.680 --> 00:00:58.690 
suspended by the way that's why that

00:00:58.690 --> 00:01:02.850 
suspended by the way that's why that
thing<00:00:58.870> floats<00:00:59.670> floats<00:01:00.670> inside<00:01:01.090> there<00:01:01.469> so<00:01:02.469> here

00:01:02.850 --> 00:01:02.860 
thing floats floats inside there so here

00:01:02.860 --> 00:01:04.380 
thing floats floats inside there so here
when<00:01:03.160> you<00:01:03.280> move<00:01:03.430> it<00:01:03.550> around<00:01:03.640> a<00:01:03.820> little<00:01:03.850> bit<00:01:04.059> you

00:01:04.380 --> 00:01:04.390 
when you move it around a little bit you

00:01:04.390 --> 00:01:07.469 
when you move it around a little bit you
get<00:01:05.350> an<00:01:05.470> idea<00:01:05.800> why<00:01:06.009> that<00:01:06.220> thing<00:01:06.399> the<00:01:07.300> whole

00:01:07.469 --> 00:01:07.479 
get an idea why that thing the whole

00:01:07.479 --> 00:01:11.300 
get an idea why that thing the whole
thing<00:01:07.509> moves<00:01:08.520> anyways<00:01:09.520> it<00:01:10.479> caused<00:01:10.750> a<00:01:10.899> problem

00:01:11.300 --> 00:01:11.310 
thing moves anyways it caused a problem

00:01:11.310 --> 00:01:16.980 
thing moves anyways it caused a problem
as<00:01:12.310> a<00:01:12.369> sock<00:01:12.820> was<00:01:13.780> actually<00:01:14.259> lodged<00:01:15.479> in<00:01:16.479> the

into the bottom I don't know what I

00:01:33.220 --> 00:01:40.340 
into the bottom I don't know what I
would<00:01:33.400> do<00:01:33.750> to<00:01:34.750> take<00:01:34.960> the<00:01:35.140> whole<00:01:36.130> thing<00:01:36.400> out<00:01:36.580> and

00:01:40.340 --> 00:01:40.350 

00:01:40.350 --> 00:01:42.350 

disconnect<00:01:41.350> it<00:01:41.620> down<00:01:41.800> there<00:01:41.950> on<00:01:42.070> the<00:01:42.100> bottom
