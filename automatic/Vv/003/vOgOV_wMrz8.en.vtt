00:00:01.610 --> 00:00:06.240
 what's up guys 

00:00:04.049 --> 00:00:07.589
 my name is paulo nick of the game to us 

00:00:06.240 --> 00:00:09.900
 saw 

00:00:07.589 --> 00:00:13.110
 I'm here to show you a layout that I 

00:00:09.900 --> 00:00:17.190
 I did that seems to have worked very well 

00:00:13.110 --> 00:00:19.890
 I'm in the club brought off for those who 

00:00:17.190 --> 00:00:26.099
 want to visit me and analyze better 

00:00:19.890 --> 00:00:30.359
 my village does thai donations are very 

00:00:26.099 --> 00:00:34.290
 but it's because you just told the 

00:00:30.359 --> 00:00:37.140
 all season then this layout 

00:00:34.290 --> 00:00:40.410
 It works for both farmar and pra 

00:00:37.140 --> 00:00:41.219
 earn some trophies as you can 

00:00:40.410 --> 00:00:44.489
 to see 

00:00:41.219 --> 00:00:49.890
 I left a little place there in the middle of the village. 

00:00:44.489 --> 00:00:52.829
 and the resources around for those who do not have 

00:00:49.890 --> 00:00:55.129
 do not think much think it's easy to 

00:00:52.829 --> 00:01:00.059
 steal your resources 

00:00:55.129 --> 00:01:02.430
 but it is not quite like that I have a rifle ak do 

00:01:00.059 --> 00:01:04.979
 my first 

00:01:02.430 --> 00:01:06.869
 the first one who has attacked me this 

00:01:04.979 --> 00:01:13.310
 down here I was still with a layout 

00:01:06.869 --> 00:01:13.310
 Old and expensive took up grass though 

00:01:20.560 --> 00:01:27.549
 So this guy who attacked me was with 

00:01:23.189 --> 00:01:31.390
 126 barbarians and decided to put everything there 

00:01:27.549 --> 00:01:37.030
 in the middle of that there we have three banknotes 

00:01:31.390 --> 00:01:41.740
 Hidden won two curves also that 

00:01:37.030 --> 00:01:44.710
 Not two seconds left alive. 

00:01:41.740 --> 00:01:48.220
 the three sectors of the archer have four 

00:01:44.710 --> 00:01:50.460
 mortars and the two towers of the 

00:01:48.220 --> 00:01:54.069
 reach there in the middle 

00:01:50.460 --> 00:01:56.740
 I will barbarian still appear to give a 

00:01:54.069 --> 00:02:02.470
 help law then it is almost impossible 

00:01:56.740 --> 00:02:06.369
 Someone out there alive in the middle is 

00:02:02.470 --> 00:02:10.959
 resources so well protected here because 

00:02:06.369 --> 00:02:14.400
 It's very difficult to get detonated. 

00:02:10.959 --> 00:02:17.970
 sectors before picking up the resources 

00:02:14.400 --> 00:02:22.299
 also the village center and it is not 

00:02:17.970 --> 00:02:24.450
 unprotected has a mortar a tower 

00:02:22.299 --> 00:02:28.959
 The magician down here has the castle. 

00:02:24.450 --> 00:02:32.850
 also help protect you on the spot 

00:02:28.959 --> 00:02:32.850
 Someone attack here underneath 

00:02:34.910 --> 00:02:42.090
 so as you see he used so many 

00:02:38.730 --> 00:02:48.120
 troops and did not fail to do 

00:02:42.090 --> 00:02:52.140
 no damage in the village then 

00:02:48.120 --> 00:02:54.620
 apparently is a very good layout for 

00:02:52.140 --> 00:02:57.510
 Who has the cvv 8? 

00:02:54.620 --> 00:02:59.850
 I do not want to make a long video 

00:02:57.510 --> 00:03:02.460
 it was just to show this layout that 

00:02:59.850 --> 00:03:03.930
 works very well to form and also 

00:03:02.460 --> 00:03:07.200
 earn some trophies 

00:03:03.930 --> 00:03:11.190
 I hope you have enjoyed your favorite and 

00:03:07.200 --> 00:03:13.790
 show your friends up to one more 

00:03:11.190 --> 00:03:13.790
 Have a good game
