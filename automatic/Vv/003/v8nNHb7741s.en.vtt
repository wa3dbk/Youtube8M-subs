00:00:15.179 --> 00:00:20.760
 Good quest taking this opportunity 

00:00:17.640 --> 00:00:23.400

00:00:23.400 --> 00:00:33.800
 Good day for you guys, I use the 

00:00:27.599 --> 00:00:33.800
 k series cost is not a toast in raid 

00:00:38.000 --> 00:00:45.840
 a high definition is very cool is the 

00:00:42.420 --> 00:00:48.090
 live recording is killer 

00:00:45.840 --> 00:00:50.100
 Yes it's a stander that I think all 

00:00:48.090 --> 00:00:53.460
 world should experience should have 

00:00:50.100 --> 00:00:56.070
 in raid the hybrid it gives you a 

00:00:53.460 --> 00:00:58.489
 very great flexibility you have a 

00:00:56.070 --> 00:00:58.489
 ping 

00:01:00.250 --> 00:01:07.660
 for only a very special clarity with sounds 

00:01:05.620 --> 00:01:11.680
 but I'm a thousand guy 

00:01:07.660 --> 00:01:13.510
 the script is the people who make multishow 

00:01:11.680 --> 00:01:15.580
 just go down there halfway 

00:01:13.510 --> 00:01:18.940
 uncontrolled and ends up breaking 

00:01:15.580 --> 00:01:25.060
 pratinhos there after much testing I 

00:01:18.940 --> 00:01:31.440
 I arrived in the series the custom daycare centers and I 

00:01:25.060 --> 00:01:34.330
 use 17 18 and 19 inches larger is 

00:01:31.440 --> 00:01:37.540
 just so you do not have to touch too much 

00:01:34.330 --> 00:01:38.380
 has a very good response from the 

00:01:37.540 --> 00:01:41.140
 plates 

00:01:38.380 --> 00:01:44.530
 the a series is a very versatile series 

00:01:41.140 --> 00:01:47.170
 It serves for pop music to Serpa jessÃ© 

00:01:44.530 --> 00:01:51.520
 any musical style strikes very well 

00:01:47.170 --> 00:01:55.960

00:01:51.520 --> 00:01:59.350
 my setup.exe flash crash 17 is very 

00:01:55.960 --> 00:02:01.450
 It's cool that he has one inside of mine. 

00:01:59.350 --> 00:02:04.060
 step in which the dishes are larger 

00:02:01.450 --> 00:02:06.909
 the key is always bigger then the fast 

00:02:04.060 --> 00:02:08.310
 creche midon dickey shorter then 

00:02:06.909 --> 00:02:12.820
