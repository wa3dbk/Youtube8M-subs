00:00:38.209 --> 00:00:38.219 
wasn't committed enough and we weren't

00:00:38.219 --> 00:00:39.920 
wasn't committed enough and we weren't
trying<00:00:38.340> to<00:00:38.460> penetrate<00:00:38.670> them<00:00:39.090> enough<00:00:39.329> wasn't

00:00:39.920 --> 00:00:39.930 
trying to penetrate them enough wasn't

00:00:39.930 --> 00:00:41.869 
trying to penetrate them enough wasn't
decisive<00:00:40.680> enough<00:00:40.920> it<00:00:41.129> wasn't<00:00:41.309> clinical

00:00:41.869 --> 00:00:41.879 
decisive enough it wasn't clinical

00:00:41.879 --> 00:00:43.880 
decisive enough it wasn't clinical
enough<00:00:42.149> basically<00:00:42.719> a<00:00:42.899> lot<00:00:43.230> of<00:00:43.350> words<00:00:43.680> it

wasn't<00:00:44.160> enough<00:00:44.370> of<00:00:44.550> and<00:00:45.050> so<00:00:46.050> not<00:00:46.230> a<00:00:46.289> good

00:00:46.520 --> 00:00:46.530 
wasn't enough of and so not a good

00:00:46.530 --> 00:00:47.660 
wasn't enough of and so not a good
enough<00:00:46.710> performance<00:00:46.920> from<00:00:47.280> manchester

00:00:47.660 --> 00:00:47.670 
enough performance from manchester

00:00:47.670 --> 00:00:49.369 
enough performance from manchester
united<00:00:47.969> tonight<00:00:48.090> at<00:00:48.420> all<00:00:48.480> but<00:00:48.960> somehow<00:00:49.200> we

00:00:49.369 --> 00:00:49.379 
united tonight at all but somehow we

00:00:49.379 --> 00:00:50.240 
united tonight at all but somehow we
managed<00:00:49.590> to<00:00:49.649> get<00:00:49.800> the<00:00:49.890> victory<00:00:50.100> that's

00:00:50.240 --> 00:00:50.250 
managed to get the victory that's

00:00:50.250 --> 00:00:51.560 
managed to get the victory that's
basically<00:00:50.610> the<00:00:50.730> story<00:00:50.969> of<00:00:51.149> the<00:00:51.239> night<00:00:51.360> I<00:00:51.390> think

00:00:51.560 --> 00:00:51.570 
basically the story of the night I think

00:00:51.570 --> 00:00:53.510 
basically the story of the night I think
Newcastle<00:00:51.780> were<00:00:52.199> playing<00:00:52.440> well<00:00:52.649> you<00:00:53.160> know<00:00:53.280> it

00:00:53.510 --> 00:00:53.520 
Newcastle were playing well you know it

00:00:53.520 --> 00:00:55.400 
Newcastle were playing well you know it
was<00:00:53.640> really<00:00:53.910> a<00:00:53.940> case<00:00:54.270> of<00:00:54.329> the<00:00:54.600> two<00:00:54.960> keepers

00:00:55.400 --> 00:00:55.410 
was really a case of the two keepers

00:00:55.410 --> 00:00:57.170 
was really a case of the two keepers
shining<00:00:56.070> tonight<00:00:56.250> I<00:00:56.370> think<00:00:56.489> the<00:00:56.730> hay<00:00:56.850> has<00:00:57.000> made

00:00:57.170 --> 00:00:57.180 
shining tonight I think the hay has made

00:00:57.180 --> 00:00:59.720 
shining tonight I think the hay has made
some<00:00:57.329> absolutely<00:00:57.899> world<00:00:58.199> class<00:00:58.289> saves<00:00:58.739> to<00:00:59.370> you

00:00:59.720 --> 00:00:59.730 
some absolutely world class saves to you

00:00:59.730 --> 00:01:01.099 
some absolutely world class saves to you
know<00:00:59.820> keep<00:01:00.000> us<00:01:00.180> in<00:01:00.300> it<00:01:00.420> I<00:01:00.480> think<00:01:00.660> Tim<00:01:00.840> calls

00:01:01.099 --> 00:01:01.109 
know keep us in it I think Tim calls

00:01:01.109 --> 00:01:02.810 
know keep us in it I think Tim calls
made<00:01:01.289> some<00:01:01.440> absolutely<00:01:02.039> world<00:01:02.309> class<00:01:02.399> seems

00:01:02.810 --> 00:01:02.820 
made some absolutely world class seems

00:01:02.820 --> 00:01:05.090 
made some absolutely world class seems
to<00:01:03.239> keep<00:01:03.420> Newcastle<00:01:03.989> in<00:01:04.110> it<00:01:04.229> and<00:01:04.379> I<00:01:04.860> thought

00:01:05.090 --> 00:01:05.100 
to keep Newcastle in it and I thought

00:01:05.100 --> 00:01:06.380 
to keep Newcastle in it and I thought
the<00:01:05.220> two<00:01:05.369> keepers<00:01:05.729> really<00:01:06.030> paid<00:01:06.240> well

00:01:06.380 --> 00:01:06.390 
the two keepers really paid well

00:01:06.390 --> 00:01:08.810 
the two keepers really paid well
everybody<00:01:06.990> else<00:01:07.170> not<00:01:07.409> so<00:01:07.439> good<00:01:07.830> you<00:01:08.490> know<00:01:08.610> bit

00:01:08.810 --> 00:01:08.820 
everybody else not so good you know bit

00:01:08.820 --> 00:01:10.460 
everybody else not so good you know bit
of<00:01:08.909> a<00:01:09.030> poor<00:01:09.330> performance<00:01:09.510> from<00:01:09.960> the<00:01:10.140> team

00:01:10.460 --> 00:01:10.470 
of a poor performance from the team

00:01:10.470 --> 00:01:11.630 
of a poor performance from the team
around<00:01:10.619> I<00:01:10.830> think<00:01:11.010> Rooney's<00:01:11.280> work<00:01:11.490> this

00:01:11.630 --> 00:01:11.640 
around I think Rooney's work this

00:01:11.640 --> 00:01:13.609 
around I think Rooney's work this
absolute<00:01:12.270> shock<00:01:12.570> top<00:01:12.780> up<00:01:12.930> top<00:01:12.960> today<00:01:13.409> you<00:01:13.470> know

00:01:16.609 --> 00:01:16.619 
you know that most likely person to make

00:01:16.619 --> 00:01:17.719 
you know that most likely person to make
things<00:01:16.770> happen<00:01:16.950> even<00:01:17.189> if<00:01:17.369> he<00:01:17.430> did<00:01:17.580> business

00:01:17.719 --> 00:01:17.729

that before it's but I think bringing
yanez<00:01:57.360> on<00:01:57.479> for<00:01:57.689> him<00:01:57.780> was<00:01:57.990> the<00:01:58.140> correct

00:01:58.310 --> 00:01:58.320 
yanez on for him was the correct

minute<00:02:39.930> I<00:02:39.989> was<00:02:40.079> resigned<00:02:40.470> to<00:02:40.620> the<00:02:40.709> fact<00:02:40.739> that

00:02:40.909 --> 00:02:40.919 
minute I was resigned to the fact that

00:02:40.919 --> 00:02:41.990 
minute I was resigned to the fact that
we're<00:02:41.069> probably<00:02:41.220> going<00:02:41.400> to<00:02:41.489> draw<00:02:41.639> that<00:02:41.669> game

00:02:41.990 --> 00:02:42.000 
we're probably going to draw that game

00:02:42.000 --> 00:02:43.550 
we're probably going to draw that game
because<00:02:42.090> it<00:02:42.389> just<00:02:42.689> wasn't<00:02:43.049> that<00:02:43.109> urgency

00:02:43.550 --> 00:02:43.560 
because it just wasn't that urgency

00:02:43.560 --> 00:02:45.830 
because it just wasn't that urgency
there<00:02:43.859> wasn't<00:02:44.069> that<00:02:44.099> classic<00:02:44.639> drive<00:02:45.329> from

00:02:45.830 --> 00:02:45.840 
there wasn't that classic drive from

00:02:45.840 --> 00:02:47.179 
there wasn't that classic drive from
Manchester<00:02:46.230> United<00:02:46.470> to<00:02:46.530> get<00:02:46.709> that<00:02:46.829> ball<00:02:47.010> for

00:02:47.179 --> 00:02:47.189 
Manchester United to get that ball for
