scrumpy he becomes the yellow lantern I

00:03:45.970 --> 00:03:48.780 
scrumpy he becomes the yellow lantern I
guess<00:03:46.150> so<00:03:46.330> and<00:03:46.810> when<00:03:47.440> he<00:03:47.590> starts<00:03:47.950> to<00:03:48.190> fight<00:03:48.550> he

00:03:48.780 --> 00:03:48.790

powering<00:03:51.040> like<00:03:51.490> was<00:03:51.850> stronger<00:03:52.450> so<00:03:52.870> exactly

00:03:53.130 --> 00:03:53.140 
powering like was stronger so exactly

00:03:53.140 --> 00:03:55.590 
powering like was stronger so exactly
not<00:03:53.350> the<00:03:53.470> ring<00:03:53.650> won't<00:03:53.890> do<00:03:54.100> nothing<00:03:54.550> so<00:03:55.000> from
