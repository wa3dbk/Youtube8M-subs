00:00:33.950 --> 00:00:40.640
 Is it a fortress that put out the reel seat ring and put a grip ? 

00:00:38.500 --> 00:00:42.060
 It looks like this 

00:00:40.640 --> 00:00:44.460

00:00:44.460 --> 00:00:48.410
 The position where the balancer attaches is also attached 

00:00:48.420 --> 00:00:51.350

00:00:51.400 --> 00:00:57.750

 A tool to paint a pastor on the head to ev 

00:01:01.410 --> 00:01:07.370

00:01:07.370 --> 00:01:14.140

00:01:10.450 --> 00:01:16.329
 I want to put a clip on this grip is also a carbon pipe and thickness 

00:01:14.140 --> 00:01:19.120
 Almost a kind 

00:01:16.329 --> 00:01:23.490
 By'm thickness of about tightly enter 

00:01:19.120 --> 00:01:23.490
 I think that I want to put on this condition 

00:01:25.790 --> 00:01:28.450
 You can fall down 

00:01:31.230 --> 00:01:34.160
 Bach 

00:01:45.020 --> 00:01:48.980
 Kess 

00:01:46.080 --> 00:01:48.980
 I will mix 

00:01:51.550 --> 00:01:55.830
 Good 

00:01:53.950 --> 00:02:00.020
 Thank Yes 

00:01:55.830 --> 00:02:00.020
 I think that I want to paint in here to the 

00:02:00.909 --> 00:02:07.670
 Book 

00:02:02.700 --> 00:02:07.670
 I will paint it as I ate as before. 

00:02:21.490 --> 00:02:24.990
 I'm painting on Bettabeta like this 

00:02:27.530 --> 00:02:35.540
 Really like no However that does not have a pastor in the blank 

00:02:32.250 --> 00:02:35.540
 I will paint a lot 

00:02:39.630 --> 00:02:45.300
 I will fish here when there is something left to paint. 

00:02:43.230 --> 00:02:48.270
 I say that the grip has slipped 

00:02:45.300 --> 00:02:52.160
 It's slow if it happens 

00:02:48.270 --> 00:02:55.770
 Cut all of the one grip to and I from it 

00:02:52.160 --> 00:02:59.590
 It will be rebuilt from the grip again 

00:02:55.770 --> 00:03:02.370
 I want to secure here and only now 

00:02:59.590 --> 00:03:02.370
 It will become the person who has entered 

00:03:11.160 --> 00:03:14.780
 Properly paint up to the root 

00:03:16.940 --> 00:03:24.790
 Yes 

00:03:18.490 --> 00:03:26.000
 I will give you a grip here with a lot of paint and turn it also when pointing this 

00:03:24.790 --> 00:03:31.010
 While 

00:03:26.000 --> 00:03:37.000
 The hand that pulled out to put pull out from time to time in we will put while rotating the grip 

00:03:31.010 --> 00:03:37.000
 Will continue to so tightly pastor falls within this repeat 

00:03:51.580 --> 00:03:56.250
 It's good, I'm getting this one 

00:04:00.610 --> 00:04:04.650
 It's coming out more and more, but without worrying about this 

00:04:15.410 --> 00:04:22.209
 I have already changed a little more 

00:04:17.870 --> 00:04:22.209
 And this last decision is 

00:04:23.050 --> 00:04:28.800
 Jean reel seat ring 

00:04:25.900 --> 00:04:28.800
 Don't run out 

00:04:33.540 --> 00:04:36.449
 I will suppress 

00:04:35.190 --> 00:04:40.949
 And 

00:04:36.449 --> 00:04:45.529
 It is alcohol again here and there is a certain incense burner neatly here 

00:04:40.949 --> 00:04:45.529
 It looks very bad if you don't take it 

00:05:17.289 --> 00:05:22.400
 If I try to take it with tissue only, I ca n't get it, but this way alcohol 

00:05:20.710 --> 00:05:25.330
 If you put it on 

00:05:22.400 --> 00:05:25.330
 I can take it beautifully 

00:05:28.920 --> 00:05:38.700
 Yes, comes with a little tissue debris is shiny but clean here 

00:05:34.980 --> 00:05:44.330
 It was no longer a poke who was protruding a little while ago 

00:05:38.700 --> 00:05:44.330
 Now wait 5 minutes for this grip to stick 

00:05:44.950 --> 00:05:54.280
 Left lungs I 

00:05:47.320 --> 00:05:57.620
 But the Tteyuu lot are making this this time I've been made for the purpose Tteyuu right ring lot 

00:05:54.280 --> 00:06:00.080
 Well sea bass in the river 

00:05:57.620 --> 00:06:05.270
 To be able to use something 

00:06:00.080 --> 00:06:08.700
 Well surprisingly the blank itself is hard, so that power fighter 

00:06:05.270 --> 00:06:12.540
 I think that I will cope with quite strong fish 

00:06:08.700 --> 00:06:15.580
 I think if you want to use this difference in various situations 

00:06:12.540 --> 00:06:17.080
 Use the menu in Egging and say 

00:06:15.580 --> 00:06:19.600
 Oh dear 

00:06:17.080 --> 00:06:25.400
 A field aimed at Texas rig 

00:06:19.600 --> 00:06:31.389
 Rockfish Arakabu is But I is Arakabu in Kyushu when or go fished there 

00:06:25.400 --> 00:06:31.389
 I think I want to use a little bit still attached 

00:06:31.400 --> 00:06:36.340
 Boo If you do not take properly attached to the two Group 

00:06:55.510 --> 00:07:00.710
 Light 

00:06:57.610 --> 00:07:02.569
 All you have to do is wait 

00:07:00.710 --> 00:07:03.860
 You earnestly wait 

00:07:02.569 --> 00:07:05.100
 5 minutes but 

00:07:03.860 --> 00:07:08.340
 eh 

00:07:05.100 --> 00:07:12.670
 In this time from now 

00:07:08.340 --> 00:07:15.840
 Mounting position of immediately meeting guide would otherwise 

00:07:12.670 --> 00:07:19.380
 I would like to do a little 

00:07:15.840 --> 00:07:22.710
 A little mat part here from now 

00:07:19.380 --> 00:07:25.240
 I think I want to lose a bit here 

00:07:22.710 --> 00:07:28.380
 It is in order to finish more cool Sir 

00:07:25.240 --> 00:07:28.380
 Then the next is up to the decoration 

00:07:29.020 --> 00:07:32.020
