 that extreme that he mans a Spanish company that he is dedicated to the sector 

00:00:08.950 --> 00:00:12.259
 of telemarketing we are a contact center 

00:00:12.259 --> 00:00:16.089
 if we dedicate ourselves to this way, he challenged issues of attention and telephone sales 

00:00:17.240 --> 00:00:19.039
 we have already 

00:00:19.039 --> 00:00:23.349
 in Latin America four years and here to the valley area to Cali in masters makes a 

00:00:23.349 --> 00:00:24.339
 year 

00:00:24.339 --> 00:00:29.449
 per cent if we are working in peru min colombia paraguay and in spain 

00:00:30.189 --> 00:00:31.730
 i on the stand 

00:00:31.730 --> 00:00:34.730
 oaxaca that telephone contact is fundamental 

00:00:35.690 --> 00:00:39.130
 we have been installed in Cali for one year 

00:00:39.130 --> 00:00:41.820
 in this time we have talked about the staff we have gone from being 

00:00:41.820 --> 00:00:43.340
 approximately 

00:00:43.340 --> 00:00:47.520
 four hundred people in the lyceum to overcome the eight hundred at the close of 

00:00:47.520 --> 00:00:48.970
 year 2010 

00:00:48.970 --> 00:00:52.900
 the forecast for 2012 eleven sorry that continue to grow by 

00:00:53.580 --> 00:00:56.290
 we have to undertake new investments to 

00:00:56.290 --> 00:00:58.440
 to increase our capacity 

00:00:58.440 --> 00:01:04.190
 I predictably will increase minimum percent and another 400 more people 

00:01:04.190 --> 00:01:08.860
 for in our headquarters of Cali, that is the great news that the three of them bring 

00:01:08.860 --> 00:01:10.070
 shop sticks 

00:01:10.070 --> 00:01:13.090
 they will spend a workforce of 800 people 

00:01:13.090 --> 00:01:15.580
 at a hand of 400 to 

00:01:15.580 --> 00:01:19.330
 ss is to increase those eight hundred and predictably before she gets 

00:01:19.330 --> 00:01:23.270
 finish the year 2011 we want to pass to those thousand two hundred people approximately 

00:01:23.270 --> 00:01:26.270
 percent I think the secret will be every part accessed from the 

00:01:26.270 --> 00:01:28.580
 management in human management that we do 

00:01:28.580 --> 00:01:33.210
 in the good results that the cali personnel are giving to 

00:01:33.210 --> 00:01:34.520
 our clients 

00:01:34.520 --> 00:01:38.970
 and that keeps them trusting us to continue trusting in the 

00:01:38.970 --> 00:01:44.170
 Cali staff to keep growing I think it is part of the 

00:01:44.170 --> 00:01:49.460
 tc creta not the perspectives of ponciano is treated as it has been to adapt to the use 

00:01:49.460 --> 00:01:50.530
 to the employees 

00:01:50.530 --> 00:01:51.909
 two are the officials 

00:01:51.909 --> 00:01:55.070
 with Colombian workers at European time 

00:01:55.070 --> 00:02:00.570
 amen at the beginning as it costs a little interest is hard 

00:02:00.570 --> 00:02:04.520
 what is certain is that at the end are the schedules on the occasion the shifts 

00:02:04.520 --> 00:02:07.380
 they are very comfortable, rest times are respected 

00:02:07.380 --> 00:02:10.279
 is that things are not excessively long 

00:02:10.279 --> 00:02:13.869
 in we try to have a complete equation 

00:02:13.869 --> 00:02:16.069
 placed to the end by figuring out a way 

00:02:16.069 --> 00:02:19.500
 a of the correct way is more sometimes to those with harmonic conago in these 

00:02:19.499 --> 00:02:23.129
 workers of which I prefer casias arenas turn because it allows me to organize 

00:02:23.129 --> 00:02:26.630
 enjoy more the day when you have schedule tomorrow in tevez the truth is 

00:02:26.629 --> 00:02:29.650
 which is surprisingly much better or they are adapting 

00:02:29.650 --> 00:02:33.310
 much better than what you see a priori here does not work on it you can think 

00:02:33.310 --> 00:02:34.169
 do not 

00:02:34.169 --> 00:02:38.539
 what country were they attending to which multinationals from which sectors 

00:02:39.070 --> 00:02:42.529
 percent are attending the entered now is colombia 

00:02:42.529 --> 00:02:47.239
 percent from here from Cali we are patent in 200 ha 

00:02:48.029 --> 00:02:51.569
 to the national market Spanish market and national market in charge of d 

00:02:51.569 --> 00:02:52.429
 Colombia 

00:02:52.429 --> 00:02:56.339
 he works more for multinational and international multinational companies to 

00:02:56.339 --> 00:02:57.819
 communication level 

00:02:57.819 --> 00:03:02.249
 percent and we are treatments for larraz energy sector that is 

00:03:02.249 --> 00:03:05.679
 quite diverse but the most important are the energy companies and 

00:03:05.679 --> 00:03:06.949
 telecommunications 

00:03:06.949 --> 00:03:08.440
 because telemark 

00:03:08.440 --> 00:03:11.039
 he bet you to be in colon 

00:03:11.039 --> 00:03:15.169
 because Telemar opted for Colombia as long as it was done in 2007 

00:03:15.169 --> 00:03:16.790
 we arrived in Latin America 

00:03:16.790 --> 00:03:18.929
 here for us it was 

00:03:18.929 --> 00:03:20.680
 very gratifying 

00:03:20.680 --> 00:03:24.059
 the work in this this lands 

00:03:24.059 --> 00:03:28.439
 percent and we arrived in Colombia because without a doubt everyone I think spoke 

00:03:28.439 --> 00:03:32.290
 well I think that the facilities that in a certain way are being given although 

00:03:32.289 --> 00:03:34.169
 you always need more as a company 

00:03:34.169 --> 00:03:36.519
 he favor us 

00:03:36.519 --> 00:03:40.459
 to the workforce not to qualified personnel percent we have options 

00:03:40.459 --> 00:03:43.540
 of d to find s that workforce 

00:03:45.879 --> 00:03:48.669
 fundamentally I think it's a good place to work and that is giving 

00:03:48.669 --> 00:03:51.669
 very good results we started two years ago to understand was 

00:03:52.189 --> 00:03:55.419
 And of course the post to follow and continue here continues to grow 

00:03:55.419 --> 00:03:59.569
 in general terms already speaking the investments that have interest of the 

00:03:59.569 --> 00:04:00.749
 they have in cali 

00:04:00.749 --> 00:04:05.220
 we're talking about how many percent people in hour 20 connected 

00:04:05.220 --> 00:04:09.530
 working with you as I said in Cali at the end of 2010 we were 

00:04:09.530 --> 00:04:11.889
 she more than 800 people 

00:04:11.889 --> 00:04:16.039
 and we are talking about that in the center of pereira we are right now in more than 

00:04:16.039 --> 00:04:17.189
 a thousand people 

00:04:17.189 --> 00:04:20.309
 You know we're practically three thousand 

00:04:20.309 --> 00:04:21.629
 percent families 

00:04:21.629 --> 00:04:24.020
 work with us yes 

00:04:24.020 --> 00:04:26.420
 and let's hope it continues to grow much more a year 2011
