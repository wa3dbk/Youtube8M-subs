00:00:40.180 --> 00:00:40.190 
want to call them the packaging is

00:00:40.190 --> 00:00:41.799 
want to call them the packaging is
really<00:00:40.339> nice<00:00:40.610> because<00:00:40.850> it<00:00:41.059> always<00:00:41.480> matches

00:00:41.799 --> 00:00:41.809 
really nice because it always matches

00:00:41.809 --> 00:00:44.410 
really nice because it always matches
the<00:00:42.199> color<00:00:42.440> that's<00:00:42.800> inside<00:00:43.190> so<00:00:43.879> you<00:00:43.970> can<00:00:44.150> store

00:00:44.410 --> 00:00:44.420 
the color that's inside so you can store

00:00:44.420 --> 00:00:46.240 
the color that's inside so you can store
them<00:00:44.570> a<00:00:44.629> variety<00:00:44.930> of<00:00:45.260> different<00:00:45.500> ways<00:00:45.829> and

00:00:46.240 --> 00:00:46.250 
them a variety of different ways and

00:00:46.250 --> 00:00:48.189 
them a variety of different ways and
then<00:00:46.339> it's<00:00:46.489> really<00:00:46.670> easy<00:00:46.940> to<00:00:47.089> find<00:00:47.390> them<00:00:47.720> the

00:00:48.189 --> 00:00:48.199 
then it's really easy to find them the

00:00:48.199 --> 00:00:49.539 
then it's really easy to find them the
tubes<00:00:48.530> themselves<00:00:49.040> are<00:00:49.159> kind<00:00:49.280> of<00:00:49.400> neat

00:00:49.539 --> 00:00:49.549 
tubes themselves are kind of neat

00:00:49.549 --> 00:00:51.520 
tubes themselves are kind of neat
because<00:00:49.670> they're<00:00:49.970> this<00:00:50.180> twist-off<00:00:50.780> mechanism

00:00:51.520 --> 00:00:51.530 
because they're this twist-off mechanism

00:00:51.530 --> 00:00:52.390 
because they're this twist-off mechanism
so<00:00:51.710> it's<00:00:51.860> not<00:00:51.949> like<00:00:52.129> you<00:00:52.220> can<00:00:52.369> just

00:00:52.390 --> 00:00:52.400 
so it's not like you can just

00:00:52.400 --> 00:00:55.630 
so it's not like you can just
accidentally<00:00:53.180> untwist<00:00:53.839> them<00:00:54.339> you<00:00:55.339> have<00:00:55.489> to

00:00:55.630 --> 00:00:55.640 
accidentally untwist them you have to

00:00:55.640 --> 00:00:58.750 
accidentally untwist them you have to
twist<00:00:55.909> and<00:00:56.119> untwist<00:00:57.019> them<00:00:57.170> to<00:00:57.350> open<00:00:57.650> them<00:00:57.799> they

00:00:58.750 --> 00:00:58.760 
twist and untwist them to open them they

00:00:58.760 --> 00:01:02.679 
twist and untwist them to open them they
are<00:00:58.970> ever<00:00:59.299> so<00:00:59.629> slightly<00:01:00.489> bulky<00:01:01.489> I<00:01:02.269> think

00:01:02.679 --> 00:01:02.689 
are ever so slightly bulky I think

00:01:02.689 --> 00:01:04.119 
are ever so slightly bulky I think
they're<00:01:02.809> about<00:01:02.930> the<00:01:03.229> length<00:01:03.500> of<00:01:03.680> a<00:01:03.769> regular

00:01:04.119 --> 00:01:04.129 
they're about the length of a regular

00:01:04.129 --> 00:01:06.370 
they're about the length of a regular
chapstick<00:01:04.790> but<00:01:05.180> they're<00:01:05.360> a<00:01:05.390> little<00:01:05.630> bit<00:01:05.930> kind

00:01:06.370 --> 00:01:06.380 
chapstick but they're a little bit kind

00:01:06.380 --> 00:01:08.380 
chapstick but they're a little bit kind
of<00:01:06.500> wider<00:01:06.950> in<00:01:07.310> diameter<00:01:07.520> than<00:01:08.119> a<00:01:08.180> regular

00:01:08.380 --> 00:01:08.390 
of wider in diameter than a regular

00:01:08.390 --> 00:01:12.660 
of wider in diameter than a regular
chapstick<00:01:09.080> on<00:01:09.369> this<00:01:11.170> packaging<00:01:12.170> it's<00:01:12.320> like

00:01:12.660 --> 00:01:12.670 
chapstick on this packaging it's like

00:01:12.670 --> 00:01:15.910 
chapstick on this packaging it's like
it's<00:01:13.670> not<00:01:13.790> metal<00:01:14.180> it's<00:01:14.450> it's<00:01:14.900> maybe<00:01:15.259> tin<00:01:15.650> I

00:01:15.910 --> 00:01:15.920 
it's not metal it's it's maybe tin I

00:01:15.920 --> 00:01:18.700 
it's not metal it's it's maybe tin I
don't<00:01:16.820> know<00:01:16.970> it's<00:01:17.240> it's<00:01:17.570> not<00:01:17.810> plastic<00:01:18.500> and

00:01:18.700 --> 00:01:18.710 
don't know it's it's not plastic and

00:01:18.710 --> 00:01:20.650 
don't know it's it's not plastic and
it's<00:01:19.010> not<00:01:19.250> glass<00:01:19.730> or<00:01:20.090> anything<00:01:20.330> like<00:01:20.600> that

00:01:20.650 --> 00:01:20.660 
it's not glass or anything like that

00:01:20.660 --> 00:01:23.380 
it's not glass or anything like that
it's<00:01:21.200> just<00:01:21.350> actually<00:01:21.950> really<00:01:22.250> neat<00:01:22.460> I<00:01:22.730> think

00:01:23.380 --> 00:01:23.390 
it's just actually really neat I think

00:01:23.390 --> 00:01:25.330 
it's just actually really neat I think
that's<00:01:23.840> what<00:01:24.110> kind<00:01:24.260> of<00:01:24.380> adds<00:01:24.680> to<00:01:24.890> the<00:01:24.980> price<00:01:25.280> of

00:01:25.330 --> 00:01:25.340 
that's what kind of adds to the price of

00:01:25.340 --> 00:01:26.830 
that's what kind of adds to the price of
them<00:01:25.640> they<00:01:25.820> are<00:01:25.850> a<00:01:26.000> little<00:01:26.300> bit<00:01:26.540> on<00:01:26.690> the

00:01:26.830 --> 00:01:26.840 
them they are a little bit on the

00:01:26.840 --> 00:01:29.920 
them they are a little bit on the
expensive<00:01:27.080> side<00:01:27.850> this<00:01:28.850> is<00:01:29.060> the<00:01:29.210> product<00:01:29.659> fully

00:01:29.920 --> 00:01:29.930

it's clear I haven't really broken down

it's a very sheer wash of color but
they're<00:02:07.159> very<00:02:07.310> buildable<00:02:07.729> so<00:02:08.090> I'll<00:02:08.179> swipe

00:02:08.440 --> 00:02:08.450 
they're very buildable so I'll swipe

intensity you can keep going and so you

00:02:20.209 --> 00:02:22.839 
intensity you can keep going and so you
can<00:02:20.480> really<00:02:20.900> kind<00:02:21.409> of<00:02:21.560> just<00:02:21.739> keep<00:02:22.040> swiping<00:02:22.400> it

color<00:03:51.570> is<00:03:51.900> actually<00:03:52.560> well<00:03:53.010> it<00:03:53.190> is<00:03:53.370> it's<00:03:53.580> more

00:03:53.780 --> 00:03:53.790

00:03:53.790 --> 00:03:56.780 
color is actually well it is it's more
plum<00:03:54.180> it's<00:03:54.540> got<00:03:54.750> a<00:03:54.780> little<00:03:55.050> bit<00:03:55.260> more<00:03:55.290> Brown<00:03:56.220> to

00:03:56.780 --> 00:03:56.790 
plum it's got a little bit more Brown to

00:03:56.790 --> 00:03:59.270 
plum it's got a little bit more Brown to
it<00:03:56.970> a<00:03:57.239> little<00:03:57.840> bit<00:03:57.989> more<00:03:58.200> of<00:03:58.320> a<00:03:58.410> burgundy<00:03:58.799> kind

00:03:59.270 --> 00:03:59.280 
it a little bit more of a burgundy kind

00:03:59.280 --> 00:04:01.400 
it a little bit more of a burgundy kind
of<00:03:59.370> color<00:03:59.690> so<00:04:00.690> if<00:04:00.750> you<00:04:00.840> can<00:04:00.989> see<00:04:01.260> the

00:04:01.400 --> 00:04:01.410 
of color so if you can see the

00:04:01.410 --> 00:04:04.070 
of color so if you can see the
difference<00:04:01.830> there<00:04:02.100> the<00:04:02.760> berry<00:04:03.090> is<00:04:03.450> very<00:04:03.810> much

00:04:04.070 --> 00:04:04.080 
difference there the berry is very much

00:04:04.080 --> 00:04:07.729 
difference there the berry is very much
of<00:04:04.350> a<00:04:04.560> kind<00:04:04.920> of<00:04:05.100> bright<00:04:05.959> kind<00:04:06.959> of<00:04:07.049> berry<00:04:07.380> color

00:04:07.729 --> 00:04:07.739 
of a kind of bright kind of berry color

00:04:07.739 --> 00:04:10.340 
of a kind of bright kind of berry color
and<00:04:08.100> then<00:04:08.700> the<00:04:08.820> plum<00:04:09.120> color<00:04:09.420> is<00:04:09.720> just<00:04:09.930> a<00:04:10.019> little

00:04:10.340 --> 00:04:10.350 
and then the plum color is just a little

00:04:10.350 --> 00:04:13.880 
and then the plum color is just a little
bit<00:04:10.470> more<00:04:10.830> of<00:04:11.100> this<00:04:11.840> brown<00:04:12.840> burgundy<00:04:13.500> kind<00:04:13.769> of

00:04:13.880 --> 00:04:13.890 
bit more of this brown burgundy kind of

00:04:13.890 --> 00:04:16.610 
bit more of this brown burgundy kind of
color<00:04:14.299> so<00:04:15.299> this<00:04:15.480> is<00:04:15.630> the<00:04:15.750> berry<00:04:15.989> and<00:04:16.260> this<00:04:16.440> is<00:04:16.590> a

00:04:16.610 --> 00:04:16.620 
color so this is the berry and this is a

00:04:16.620 --> 00:04:19.880 
color so this is the berry and this is a
plum<00:04:17.010> so<00:04:17.549> they<00:04:17.700> are<00:04:17.850> different<00:04:18.560> enough<00:04:19.560> that<00:04:19.859> I

00:04:19.880 --> 00:04:19.890 
plum so they are different enough that I

00:04:19.890 --> 00:04:21.469 
plum so they are different enough that I
think<00:04:20.160> if<00:04:20.280> you<00:04:20.430> are<00:04:20.459> kind<00:04:20.790> of<00:04:20.940> on<00:04:21.150> the<00:04:21.299> fence

00:04:21.469 --> 00:04:21.479 
think if you are kind of on the fence

00:04:21.479 --> 00:04:23.480 
think if you are kind of on the fence
about<00:04:21.660> picking<00:04:22.140> up<00:04:22.200> the<00:04:22.260> berry<00:04:22.590> color<00:04:22.680> I<00:04:23.220> think

00:04:23.480 --> 00:04:23.490 
about picking up the berry color I think

00:04:23.490 --> 00:04:25.130 
about picking up the berry color I think
it's<00:04:23.760> totally<00:04:23.910> worth<00:04:24.150> it<00:04:24.390> to<00:04:24.540> go<00:04:24.660> ahead<00:04:24.780> and<00:04:25.050> do

00:04:25.130 --> 00:04:25.140 
it's totally worth it to go ahead and do

00:04:25.140 --> 00:04:27.290 
it's totally worth it to go ahead and do
it<00:04:25.260> because<00:04:25.350> they<00:04:25.590> are<00:04:25.620> very<00:04:25.919> different<00:04:26.300> so

00:04:27.290 --> 00:04:27.300 
it because they are very different so

00:04:27.300 --> 00:04:29.030 
it because they are very different so
though<00:04:27.540> it's<00:04:27.690> again<00:04:27.960> the<00:04:28.110> berry<00:04:28.350> and<00:04:28.620> the<00:04:28.740> plum

00:04:29.030 --> 00:04:29.040 
though it's again the berry and the plum

00:04:29.040 --> 00:04:30.830 
though it's again the berry and the plum
color<00:04:29.370> and<00:04:29.790> like<00:04:29.970> I<00:04:30.090> said<00:04:30.150> of<00:04:30.419> course<00:04:30.479> I

00:04:30.830 --> 00:04:30.840 
color and like I said of course I

00:04:30.840 --> 00:04:32.120 
color and like I said of course I
thought<00:04:31.020> that<00:04:31.169> they<00:04:31.290> were<00:04:31.350> different<00:04:31.650> enough

00:04:32.120 --> 00:04:32.130 
thought that they were different enough

00:04:32.130 --> 00:04:34.850 
thought that they were different enough
and<00:04:32.490> yeah<00:04:33.450> I've<00:04:33.690> just<00:04:33.750> really<00:04:34.320> been<00:04:34.350> enjoying
