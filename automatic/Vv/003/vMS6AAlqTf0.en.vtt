00:00:09.980 --> 00:00:14.940
 ladies and gentlemen, my name is tea 

00:00:12.390 --> 00:00:17.669
 reaper 93 and today we are here to give 

00:00:14.940 --> 00:00:20.099
 take a look at block storm what it is 

00:00:17.669 --> 00:00:21.749
 this title well is a title that we do n't 

00:00:20.099 --> 00:00:24.329
 particularly excited is one 

00:00:21.749 --> 00:00:26.039
 shooter combined with minecraft let's say 

00:00:24.329 --> 00:00:28.369
 let's say call of duty meets minecraft 

00:00:26.039 --> 00:00:30.630
 as we called the article is 

00:00:28.369 --> 00:00:32.760
 unfortunately I cannot offer you a grand 

00:00:30.630 --> 00:00:35.190
 fooding of shootings and stuff like that 

00:00:32.760 --> 00:00:37.020
 because there is nobody on the servers 

00:00:35.190 --> 00:00:40.260
 so it's a little hard to play ho 

00:00:37.020 --> 00:00:44.340
 recorded a little bit of walking in the 

00:00:40.260 --> 00:00:47.370
 huge maps designed I don't know for 32 64 

00:00:44.340 --> 00:00:49.110
 300 thousand players who are empty because 

00:00:47.370 --> 00:00:50.460
 there are no players so you can 

00:00:49.110 --> 00:00:53.730
 turn to the infinite these beautiful 

00:00:50.460 --> 00:00:55.200
 maps you need to find a living soul too 

00:00:53.730 --> 00:00:59.550
 in the increasingly populated areas in which they exist 

00:00:55.200 --> 00:01:01.710
 even four people and this is it 

00:00:59.550 --> 00:01:04.289
 a little bit the story of this game that 

00:01:01.710 --> 00:01:07.170
 it's not a great game honestly 

00:01:04.289 --> 00:01:13.039
 shooter system is really a lot 

00:01:07.170 --> 00:01:16.229
 base and maps are huge 

00:01:13.039 --> 00:01:18.090
 the game is simply savable 

00:01:16.229 --> 00:01:19.619
 there are no elements that will taste 

00:01:18.090 --> 00:01:20.909
 with a progression system the game 

00:01:19.619 --> 00:01:23.429
 it is not very varied and there are very few 

00:01:20.909 --> 00:01:25.079
 game mode and then you will get bored 

00:01:23.429 --> 00:01:27.270
 very soon admitted that you succeed in 

00:01:25.079 --> 00:01:28.979
 playing is the grace mark it gives 

00:01:27.270 --> 00:01:30.960
 precisely the question of very low 

00:01:28.979 --> 00:01:33.810
 population of players that are 

00:01:30.960 --> 00:01:35.429
 very few are less than ten in 

00:01:33.810 --> 00:01:39.329
 total with the second important in mind 

00:01:35.429 --> 00:01:41.039
 on all the servers that are there and therefore it is 

00:01:39.329 --> 00:01:42.539
 impossible to play even if you want 

00:01:41.039 --> 00:01:44.880
 recommend this title even if it were 

00:01:42.539 --> 00:01:47.009
 the most beautiful title in the world that does not 

00:01:44.880 --> 00:01:48.569
 it's among other things however it would be fine 

00:01:47.009 --> 00:01:51.109
 impossible to recommend for the 

00:01:48.569 --> 00:01:54.479
 simple fact that there is no one 

00:01:51.109 --> 00:01:58.950
 online to play so that's it 

00:01:54.479 --> 00:02:01.109
 for blog store is my name as always 

00:01:58.950 --> 00:02:03.139
 and it's there for 93 and I'll see you at 

00:02:01.109 --> 00:02:03.139
 next
