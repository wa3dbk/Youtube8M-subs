definition<00:00:08.700> radar<00:00:09.179> while<00:00:09.510> we're<00:00:09.690> here<00:00:09.809> with

00:00:09.950 --> 00:00:09.960 
definition radar while we're here with

00:00:09.960 --> 00:00:11.600 
definition radar while we're here with
andy<00:00:10.290> from<00:00:10.440> raymarine<00:00:11.190> who's<00:00:11.429> going<00:00:11.550> to

00:00:11.600 --> 00:00:11.610 
andy from raymarine who's going to

00:00:11.610 --> 00:00:14.240 
andy from raymarine who's going to
explain<00:00:11.910> what<00:00:12.059> it's<00:00:12.179> all<00:00:12.240> about<00:00:12.269> hi<00:00:13.250> basically

00:00:14.240 --> 00:00:14.250 
explain what it's all about hi basically

00:00:14.250 --> 00:00:16.010 
explain what it's all about hi basically
we've<00:00:14.429> enhanced<00:00:14.940> with<00:00:15.120> our<00:00:15.240> G<00:00:15.420> Series<00:00:15.450> product

00:00:16.010 --> 00:00:16.020 
we've enhanced with our G Series product

00:00:16.020 --> 00:00:17.029 
we've enhanced with our G Series product
range<00:00:16.199> with<00:00:16.529> now<00:00:16.710> brought<00:00:16.890> in

00:00:17.029 --> 00:00:17.039 
range with now brought in

00:00:17.039 --> 00:00:18.890 
range with now brought in
high-definition<00:00:17.670> digital<00:00:18.210> signal

00:00:18.890 --> 00:00:18.900 
high-definition digital signal

00:00:18.900 --> 00:00:20.900 
high-definition digital signal
processing<00:00:19.320> which<00:00:19.949> basically<00:00:20.340> eliminates

00:00:20.900 --> 00:00:20.910 
processing which basically eliminates

00:00:20.910 --> 00:00:23.420 
processing which basically eliminates
all<00:00:21.119> the<00:00:21.240> noise<00:00:21.769> around<00:00:22.769> the<00:00:22.920> target<00:00:23.130> and

00:00:23.420 --> 00:00:23.430 
all the noise around the target and

00:00:23.430 --> 00:00:25.490 
all the noise around the target and
offers<00:00:23.699> you<00:00:23.730> superior<00:00:24.180> target<00:00:24.660> definition<00:00:25.140> so

00:00:25.490 --> 00:00:25.500 
offers you superior target definition so

00:00:25.500 --> 00:00:26.420 
offers you superior target definition so
does<00:00:25.590> that<00:00:25.619> mean<00:00:25.769> like<00:00:25.949> when<00:00:26.070> I've<00:00:26.160> seen<00:00:26.340> an

00:00:26.420 --> 00:00:26.430 
does that mean like when I've seen an

00:00:26.430 --> 00:00:28.839 
does that mean like when I've seen an
old-fashioned<00:00:27.180> movie<00:00:27.390> with<00:00:27.750> summary<00:00:28.170> answers

00:00:28.839 --> 00:00:28.849 
old-fashioned movie with summary answers

00:00:28.849 --> 00:00:31.609 
old-fashioned movie with summary answers
and<00:00:29.849> it's<00:00:30.000> sort<00:00:30.119> of<00:00:30.269> it's<00:00:30.630> a<00:00:30.750> bit<00:00:30.869> fuzzy<00:00:31.109> yeah

00:00:31.609 --> 00:00:31.619 
and it's sort of it's a bit fuzzy yeah

00:00:31.619 --> 00:00:32.840 
and it's sort of it's a bit fuzzy yeah
does<00:00:32.040> that<00:00:32.130> mean<00:00:32.279> now<00:00:32.430> I'll<00:00:32.520> be<00:00:32.579> able<00:00:32.640> to<00:00:32.759> see

00:00:32.840 --> 00:00:32.850 
does that mean now I'll be able to see

00:00:32.850 --> 00:00:35.770 
does that mean now I'll be able to see
crystal<00:00:33.329> clear<00:00:33.540> idea<00:00:33.930> yeah<00:00:34.230> basically<00:00:34.500> you're

00:00:35.770 --> 00:00:35.780 
crystal clear idea yeah basically you're

00:00:35.780 --> 00:00:37.549 
crystal clear idea yeah basically you're
eliminating<00:00:36.780> all<00:00:36.899> the<00:00:36.960> noise<00:00:37.079> around<00:00:37.320> a<00:00:37.440> big

00:00:37.549 --> 00:00:37.559 
eliminating all the noise around a big

00:00:37.559 --> 00:00:39.470 
eliminating all the noise around a big
cluster<00:00:37.860> basically<00:00:38.610> splitting<00:00:38.879> it<00:00:39.090> up<00:00:39.120> to

00:00:39.470 --> 00:00:39.480 
cluster basically splitting it up to

00:00:39.480 --> 00:00:41.090 
cluster basically splitting it up to
give<00:00:39.629> the<00:00:39.750> end<00:00:39.870> user<00:00:39.930> real<00:00:40.559> sort<00:00:41.040> of

00:00:41.090 --> 00:00:41.100 
give the end user real sort of

00:00:41.100 --> 00:00:43.190 
give the end user real sort of
definition<00:00:41.610> when<00:00:41.790> they're<00:00:41.940> sort<00:00:42.090> of<00:00:42.200> cruising

00:00:43.190 --> 00:00:43.200 
definition when they're sort of cruising

00:00:43.200 --> 00:00:45.889 
definition when they're sort of cruising
along<00:00:43.290> ok<00:00:43.739> can<00:00:43.860> you<00:00:43.890> jos<00:00:44.100> yeah<00:00:44.579> sure<00:00:44.850> can<00:00:45.690> even

00:00:45.889 --> 00:00:45.899 
along ok can you jos yeah sure can even

00:00:45.899 --> 00:00:48.319 
along ok can you jos yeah sure can even
use<00:00:45.960> either<00:00:46.230> a<00:00:46.410> fixed<00:00:47.010> wire<00:00:47.160> keyboard<00:00:47.579> here<00:00:47.789> ok

corner as you sort of cruising along in
your<00:01:36.689> boats<00:01:36.930> so<00:01:37.170> we<00:01:37.650> really<00:01:37.799> are<00:01:37.979> offering

00:01:38.270 --> 00:01:38.280 
your boats so we really are offering

00:01:38.280 --> 00:01:40.219 
your boats so we really are offering
flexibility<00:01:38.850> on<00:01:39.060> the<00:01:39.090> screen<00:01:39.390> ok<00:01:39.900> let's<00:01:40.140> like

00:01:40.219 --> 00:01:40.229 
flexibility on the screen ok let's like

00:01:40.229 --> 00:01:41.390 
flexibility on the screen ok let's like
this<00:01:40.350> great<00:01:40.650> looks<00:01:40.799> pretty<00:01:40.979> cool<00:01:41.100> is<00:01:41.280> this

00:01:41.390 --> 00:01:41.400 
this great looks pretty cool is this

00:01:41.400 --> 00:01:44.749 
this great looks pretty cool is this
yeah<00:01:41.880> this<00:01:42.119> gives<00:01:42.630> us<00:01:42.810> 3d<00:01:43.399> cartography<00:01:44.399> which

00:01:44.749 --> 00:01:44.759 
yeah this gives us 3d cartography which

00:01:44.759 --> 00:01:46.340 
yeah this gives us 3d cartography which
enables<00:01:45.540> us<00:01:45.600> to<00:01:45.659> bring<00:01:45.899> up<00:01:46.020> bathymetric

00:01:46.340 --> 00:01:46.350 
enables us to bring up bathymetric

00:01:46.350 --> 00:01:49.219 
enables us to bring up bathymetric
processing<00:01:47.220> so<00:01:48.180> it<00:01:48.240> shows<00:01:48.479> the<00:01:48.689> boat<00:01:48.869> as<00:01:49.049> it's

00:01:49.219 --> 00:01:49.229 
processing so it shows the boat as it's

00:01:49.229 --> 00:01:51.289 
processing so it shows the boat as it's
going<00:01:49.380> along<00:01:49.560> in<00:01:49.890> city<00:01:50.189> and<00:01:50.970> we<00:01:51.060> can<00:01:51.180> go

00:01:51.289 --> 00:01:51.299 
going along in city and we can go

00:01:51.299 --> 00:01:52.490 
going along in city and we can go
through<00:01:51.329> and<00:01:51.630> change<00:01:51.810> various<00:01:52.290> sort<00:01:52.439> of

00:01:52.490 --> 00:01:52.500 
through and change various sort of

00:01:52.500 --> 00:01:54.340 
through and change various sort of
target<00:01:52.680> definitions<00:01:53.369> again<00:01:53.610> just<00:01:53.820> to<00:01:53.880> give<00:01:54.060> us

00:01:54.340 --> 00:01:54.350 
target definitions again just to give us

00:01:54.350 --> 00:01:56.719 
target definitions again just to give us
ultimate<00:01:55.350> sort<00:01:55.590> of<00:01:55.649> viewing<00:01:55.979> angle<00:01:56.310> when

00:01:56.719 --> 00:01:56.729 
ultimate sort of viewing angle when

00:01:56.729 --> 00:01:58.490 
ultimate sort of viewing angle when
we're<00:01:56.850> sort<00:01:57.000> of<00:01:57.060> going<00:01:57.119> so<00:01:57.930> we<00:01:58.020> can<00:01:58.140> have<00:01:58.469> that

00:01:58.490 --> 00:01:58.500 
we're sort of going so we can have that

00:01:58.500 --> 00:02:00.889 
we're sort of going so we can have that
going<00:01:58.950> side<00:01:59.189> by<00:01:59.219> side<00:01:59.640> with<00:01:59.850> a<00:01:59.939> standard<00:02:00.750> sort

00:02:13.340 --> 00:02:13.350 
with the processor that we have here we

00:02:13.350 --> 00:02:15.230 
with the processor that we have here we

for<00:02:19.320> different<00:02:19.770> territories<00:02:20.130> so<00:02:20.220> you<00:02:20.310> get<00:02:20.430> it

00:02:20.510 --> 00:02:20.520 
for different territories so you get it

00:02:20.520 --> 00:02:21.920

all in one absolutely if you buy a

00:02:21.930 --> 00:02:23.210 
all in one absolutely if you buy a
European<00:02:22.380> version<00:02:22.710> you<00:02:22.770> buy<00:02:22.860> the<00:02:22.920> whole<00:02:23.190> of

00:02:23.210 --> 00:02:23.220 
European version you buy the whole of

00:02:23.220 --> 00:02:24.560 
European version you buy the whole of
the<00:02:23.400> year<00:02:23.520> of<00:02:23.580> a<00:02:23.640> platinum<00:02:23.970> cartography<00:02:24.540> and

00:02:24.560 --> 00:02:24.570 
the year of a platinum cartography and

00:02:24.570 --> 00:02:26.390 
the year of a platinum cartography and
the<00:02:24.720> rest<00:02:24.900> of<00:02:24.960> the<00:02:25.050> world<00:02:25.200> isn't<00:02:25.350> gold<00:02:25.590> so<00:02:26.280> it

00:02:26.390 --> 00:02:26.400 
the rest of the world isn't gold so it

00:02:26.400 --> 00:02:28.730 
the rest of the world isn't gold so it
means<00:02:26.550> so<00:02:27.300> we<00:02:27.480> can<00:02:27.600> have<00:02:27.690> like<00:02:27.840> 3d<00:02:28.200> technology

00:02:28.730 --> 00:02:28.740 
means so we can have like 3d technology

00:02:28.740 --> 00:02:30.140 
means so we can have like 3d technology
for<00:02:28.890> the<00:02:28.950> whole<00:02:29.070> of<00:02:29.100> Europe<00:02:29.370> and<00:02:29.790> what<00:02:29.940> sort<00:02:30.120> of
