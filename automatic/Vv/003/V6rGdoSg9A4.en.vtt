to<00:02:08.250> long<00:02:08.939> so<00:02:09.450> what<00:02:09.659> Courtney<00:02:10.080> just<00:02:10.289> did<00:02:10.439> was

00:02:10.609 --> 00:02:10.619 
to long so what Courtney just did was

00:02:10.619 --> 00:02:13.280 
to long so what Courtney just did was
she<00:02:10.769> actually<00:02:10.890> measured<00:02:11.610> the<00:02:12.180> ice<00:02:12.360> by<00:02:12.810> putting

00:02:13.280 --> 00:02:13.290 
she actually measured the ice by putting

00:02:13.290 --> 00:02:14.899 
she actually measured the ice by putting
them<00:02:13.439> placing<00:02:14.010> him<00:02:14.099> on<00:02:14.250> to<00:02:14.430> see<00:02:14.579> if<00:02:14.730> they<00:02:14.849> were

00:02:14.899 --> 00:02:14.909 
them placing him on to see if they were

00:02:14.909 --> 00:02:16.580 
them placing him on to see if they were
too<00:02:15.150> long<00:02:15.299> in<00:02:15.540> this<00:02:15.659> case<00:02:15.900> they<00:02:16.110> were<00:02:16.170> a<00:02:16.349> little

00:02:16.580 --> 00:02:16.590 
too long in this case they were a little

00:02:16.590 --> 00:02:18.770 
too long in this case they were a little
bit<00:02:16.709> too<00:02:17.250> long<00:02:17.519> so<00:02:18.030> she<00:02:18.090> cut<00:02:18.510> them<00:02:18.629> a<00:02:18.689> little

00:02:18.770 --> 00:02:18.780 
bit too long so she cut them a little

00:02:18.780 --> 00:02:20.390 
bit too long so she cut them a little
bit<00:02:19.049> shorter<00:02:19.409> so<00:02:19.439> that<00:02:19.709> they<00:02:19.799> can<00:02:19.950> fit<00:02:20.159> across

the<00:03:33.750> cheeks<00:03:34.260> a<00:03:34.470> little<00:03:34.980> bit<00:03:35.160> but<00:03:35.519> sometimes

00:03:35.900 --> 00:03:35.910 
the cheeks a little bit but sometimes

00:03:35.910 --> 00:03:37.520 
the cheeks a little bit but sometimes
the<00:03:36.120> bright<00:03:36.389> lights<00:03:36.720> will<00:03:37.019> actually<00:03:37.260> make<00:03:37.410> her

00:03:37.520 --> 00:03:37.530 
the bright lights will actually make her

00:03:37.530 --> 00:03:39.170 
the bright lights will actually make her
cheeks<00:03:37.859> look<00:03:37.980> redder<00:03:38.430> so<00:03:38.760> you<00:03:38.849> have<00:03:38.970> to<00:03:39.060> be

00:03:39.170 --> 00:03:39.180 
cheeks look redder so you have to be

00:03:39.180 --> 00:03:41.869

I'm going to do is I'm going to put a
bronzer<00:03:51.480> underneath<00:03:51.750> so<00:03:52.139> we<00:03:52.260> give<00:03:52.409> a<00:03:52.440> little

00:03:52.610 --> 00:03:52.620 
bronzer underneath so we give a little

00:03:52.620 --> 00:03:57.319 
bronzer underneath so we give a little
bit<00:03:52.769> of<00:03:52.889> contour<00:03:55.310> she<00:03:56.310> sees<00:03:56.489> adding<00:03:56.879> some<00:03:57.090> a

00:03:57.319 --> 00:03:57.329 
bit of contour she sees adding some a

00:03:57.329 --> 00:04:00.259 
bit of contour she sees adding some a
pink<00:03:57.900> natural<00:03:58.169> color<00:03:58.650> to<00:03:58.949> the<00:03:59.220> actual<00:03:59.549> cheeks

00:04:00.259 --> 00:04:00.269 
pink natural color to the actual cheeks

00:04:00.269 --> 00:04:02.300 
pink natural color to the actual cheeks
and<00:04:00.599> then<00:04:01.079> the<00:04:01.199> bronzer<00:04:01.680> is<00:04:01.799> a<00:04:01.829> little<00:04:02.190> bit

00:04:02.300 --> 00:04:02.310 
and then the bronzer is a little bit

00:04:02.310 --> 00:04:04.069 
and then the bronzer is a little bit
lower<00:04:02.549> it's<00:04:02.849> underneath<00:04:03.269> the<00:04:03.449> cheek<00:04:03.720> that

00:04:04.069 --> 00:04:04.079 
lower it's underneath the cheek that

lower it's underneath the cheek that
gives<00:04:04.349> some<00:04:04.530> definition<00:04:05.400> on<00:04:05.519> stage<00:04:06.079> the<00:04:07.079> lips

00:04:07.309 --> 00:04:07.319 
gives some definition on stage the lips

00:04:07.319 --> 00:04:09.770 
gives some definition on stage the lips
can<00:04:07.530> also<00:04:07.709> be<00:04:07.979> intensified<00:04:08.639> with<00:04:08.790> color<00:04:09.120> ever
