for<00:00:53.350> the<00:00:53.409> noises<00:00:53.559> in<00:00:53.769> the<00:00:53.830> background<00:00:53.949> that's

00:00:54.360 --> 00:00:54.370 
for the noises in the background that's

for the noises in the background that's
my<00:00:54.489> printer<00:00:54.790> I<00:00:54.909> just<00:00:55.150> printed<00:00:55.449> something<00:00:58.589> it

00:00:59.660 --> 00:00:59.670 
my printer I just printed something it

00:00:59.670 --> 00:01:04.229 
my printer I just printed something it
seemed<00:01:00.670> to<00:01:00.790> stop<00:01:01.000> but<00:01:01.930> yeah<00:01:02.769> so<00:01:03.760> it<00:01:04.000> will<00:01:04.089> put

00:01:04.229 --> 00:01:04.239 
seemed to stop but yeah so it will put

00:01:04.239 --> 00:01:09.920 
seemed to stop but yeah so it will put
it<00:01:04.330> on<00:01:04.420> as<00:01:04.809> a<00:01:04.870> mixed<00:01:05.619> number<00:01:07.020> so<00:01:08.020> this<00:01:08.170> is<00:01:08.470> the

00:01:09.920 --> 00:01:09.930 
it on as a mixed number so this is the

00:01:09.930 --> 00:01:15.300 
it on as a mixed number so this is the
graphic<00:01:10.930> calculator<00:01:13.020> this<00:01:14.020> I<00:01:14.500> believe<00:01:15.040> will

00:01:15.300 --> 00:01:15.310 
graphic calculator this I believe will

00:01:15.310 --> 00:01:21.000 
graphic calculator this I believe will
not<00:01:15.460> work<00:01:15.729> with<00:01:16.000> the<00:01:16.390> regular<00:01:17.190> plus<00:01:18.840> um<00:01:20.010> I

00:01:21.000 --> 00:01:21.010 
not work with the regular plus um I

00:01:21.010 --> 00:01:23.190 
not work with the regular plus um I
don't<00:01:21.159> know<00:01:21.310> about<00:01:21.460> the<00:01:21.700> 83<00:01:22.240> I'm<00:01:22.450> only<00:01:22.750> I<00:01:22.990> only

00:01:23.190 --> 00:01:23.200 
don't know about the 83 I'm only I only

00:01:23.200 --> 00:01:27.540 
don't know about the 83 I'm only I only
have<00:01:23.619> an<00:01:23.770> 84<00:01:24.220> and<00:01:25.650> 30x<00:01:26.650> IIA

00:01:27.540 --> 00:01:27.550 
have an 84 and 30x IIA

00:01:27.550 --> 00:01:29.280 
have an 84 and 30x IIA
I<00:01:27.820> think<00:01:28.420> it's<00:01:28.510> how<00:01:28.630> you<00:01:28.690> say<00:01:28.900> I<00:01:28.930> don't<00:01:29.170> know

00:01:29.280 --> 00:01:29.290 
I think it's how you say I don't know

00:01:29.290 --> 00:01:35.310 
I think it's how you say I don't know
but<00:01:30.250> whatever<00:01:30.490> you<00:01:30.640> can<00:01:30.730> run<00:01:30.880> it<00:01:31.000> on<00:01:33.330> mode<00:01:34.330> you

00:01:35.310 --> 00:01:35.320 
but whatever you can run it on mode you

00:01:35.320 --> 00:01:40.080 
but whatever you can run it on mode you
display<00:01:35.680> that<00:01:35.860> screen<00:01:36.280> up<00:01:37.290> up<00:01:38.290> up<00:01:38.710> up<00:01:39.130> up<00:01:39.580> until

00:01:40.080 --> 00:01:40.090 
display that screen up up up up up until

00:01:40.090 --> 00:01:45.990 
display that screen up up up up up until
you<00:01:40.690> see<00:01:44.010> screen<00:01:45.010> that<00:01:45.190> looks<00:01:45.310> like<00:01:45.430> this<00:01:45.550> you

00:01:45.990 --> 00:01:46.000 
you see screen that looks like this you

00:01:46.000 --> 00:01:48.600 
you see screen that looks like this you
can<00:01:46.810> see<00:01:46.960> math<00:01:47.140> print<00:01:47.530> classic<00:01:48.100> which<00:01:48.280> is

00:01:48.600 --> 00:01:48.610 
can see math print classic which is

00:01:48.610 --> 00:01:51.090 
can see math print classic which is
another<00:01:48.910> one<00:01:49.150> of<00:01:49.180> my<00:01:49.270> videos<00:01:50.100> numerator

00:01:51.090 --> 00:01:51.100 
another one of my videos numerator

00:01:51.100 --> 00:01:57.930 
another one of my videos numerator
denominator<00:01:51.600> /<00:01:52.600> u<00:01:53.140> n<00:01:53.409> /<00:01:55.380> D<00:01:56.380> you<00:01:57.220> want<00:01:57.400> to<00:01:57.700> have

00:01:57.930 --> 00:01:57.940 
denominator / u n / D you want to have

00:01:57.940 --> 00:02:02.880 
denominator / u n / D you want to have
un<00:01:58.630> /<00:01:59.170> D<00:02:00.360> highlighted<00:02:01.360> you<00:02:01.900> just<00:02:02.050> go<00:02:02.230> for<00:02:02.620> it<00:02:02.680> so

00:02:02.880 --> 00:02:02.890 
un / D highlighted you just go for it so

00:02:02.890 --> 00:02:05.820 
un / D highlighted you just go for it so
it's<00:02:03.010> blinking<00:02:03.430> and<00:02:03.550> click<00:02:03.700> enter<00:02:04.530> so<00:02:05.530> if<00:02:05.680> you

00:02:05.820 --> 00:02:05.830 
it's blinking and click enter so if you

00:02:05.830 --> 00:02:16.559 
it's blinking and click enter so if you
have<00:02:07.050> let's<00:02:08.050> say<00:02:08.170> 23<00:02:09.129> no<00:02:09.640> yeah<00:02:10.539> a<00:02:12.120> 3<00:02:15.360> by<00:02:16.360> the<00:02:16.420> way

00:02:16.559 --> 00:02:16.569 
have let's say 23 no yeah a 3 by the way

00:02:16.569 --> 00:02:21.030 
have let's say 23 no yeah a 3 by the way
one<00:02:17.459> might<00:02:18.459> network<00:02:18.959> either<00:02:19.959> can't<00:02:20.709> see<00:02:20.860> where

00:02:21.030 --> 00:02:21.040 
one might network either can't see where

00:02:21.040 --> 00:02:31.570 
one might network either can't see where
you<00:02:21.129> use<00:02:21.370> one<00:02:21.640> here<00:02:24.299> -<00:02:25.349> 89<00:02:26.349> divided<00:02:26.890> by<00:02:29.130> 7<00:02:30.130> 8

00:02:31.570 --> 00:02:31.580 
you use one here - 89 divided by 7 8

00:02:31.580 --> 00:02:39.100 
you use one here - 89 divided by 7 8
oh<00:02:32.440> wait<00:02:33.440> a<00:02:33.500> minute<00:02:34.600> and<00:02:37.570> that's<00:02:38.570> I<00:02:38.720> will<00:02:38.960> be

00:02:39.100 --> 00:02:39.110 
oh wait a minute and that's I will be

00:02:39.110 --> 00:02:40.660 
oh wait a minute and that's I will be
putting<00:02:39.380> none<00:02:39.590> but<00:02:40.100> anyway

00:02:40.660 --> 00:02:40.670 
putting none but anyway

00:02:40.670 --> 00:02:44.440 
putting none but anyway
so<00:02:41.000> you'd<00:02:41.870> get<00:02:42.110> it<00:02:42.320> I<00:02:42.440> don't<00:02:43.310> can't<00:02:44.060> think<00:02:44.270> of<00:02:44.360> a

00:02:44.440 --> 00:02:44.450 
so you'd get it I don't can't think of a

00:02:44.450 --> 00:02:55.840 
so you'd get it I don't can't think of a
way<00:02:50.200> trying<00:02:51.200> to<00:02:51.260> think<00:02:51.770> one<00:02:52.870> live<00:02:53.870> 2387<00:02:54.770> so<00:02:55.190> it

00:02:55.840 --> 00:02:55.850 
way trying to think one live 2387 so it

00:02:55.850 --> 00:02:59.140 
way trying to think one live 2387 so it
would<00:02:56.090> just<00:02:56.360> show<00:02:56.600> um<00:02:57.580> here<00:02:58.580> I<00:02:58.610> can<00:02:58.880> make<00:02:59.000> what

00:02:59.140 --> 00:02:59.150 
would just show um here I can make what

00:02:59.150 --> 00:03:10.660 
would just show um here I can make what
it<00:02:59.270> would<00:02:59.360> look<00:02:59.480> like<00:02:59.540> look<00:03:00.320> like<00:03:00.500> for<00:03:09.430> if<00:03:10.430> it

00:03:10.660 --> 00:03:10.670 
it would look like look like for if it

00:03:10.670 --> 00:03:15.190 
it would look like look like for if it
was<00:03:10.790> four<00:03:11.120> and<00:03:11.240> a<00:03:11.270> half<00:03:13.420> it<00:03:14.420> basically<00:03:14.870> looked

00:03:15.190 --> 00:03:15.200 
was four and a half it basically looked

00:03:15.200 --> 00:03:18.190 
was four and a half it basically looked
like<00:03:15.350> that<00:03:15.530> in<00:03:15.710> the<00:03:15.800> answer<00:03:16.160> area<00:03:17.020> we<00:03:18.020> have<00:03:18.140> a

00:03:18.190 --> 00:03:18.200 
like that in the answer area we have a

00:03:18.200 --> 00:03:23.440 
like that in the answer area we have a
little<00:03:18.440> like<00:03:18.860> you<00:03:19.610> type<00:03:20.120> thing<00:03:21.020> than<00:03:21.830> 1/2<00:03:22.450> that

00:03:23.440 --> 00:03:23.450 
little like you type thing than 1/2 that

00:03:23.450 --> 00:03:27.820 
little like you type thing than 1/2 that
is<00:03:23.510> how<00:03:23.750> you<00:03:23.810> turn<00:03:24.050> on<00:03:25.660> mix<00:03:26.660> number<00:03:27.140> rather

00:03:27.820 --> 00:03:27.830 
is how you turn on mix number rather

00:03:27.830 --> 00:03:30.730 
is how you turn on mix number rather
than<00:03:28.130> an<00:03:28.310> improper<00:03:28.790> fraction<00:03:28.820> and<00:03:29.740> don't

00:03:30.730 --> 00:03:30.740 
than an improper fraction and don't

00:03:30.740 --> 00:03:34.180 
than an improper fraction and don't
