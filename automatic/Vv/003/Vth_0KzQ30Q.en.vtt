more<00:02:44.580> thing<00:02:44.790> I<00:02:44.880> want<00:02:45.060> to<00:02:45.090> mention<00:02:45.150> about<00:02:46.140> the

00:02:46.370 --> 00:02:46.380 
more thing I want to mention about the

00:02:46.380 --> 00:02:48.410 
more thing I want to mention about the
visor<00:02:46.620> speed<00:02:47.460> and<00:02:47.580> strength<00:02:47.730> is<00:02:48.030> made<00:02:48.210> sure

visor speed and strength is made sure

00:02:48.420 --> 00:02:50.690 
visor speed and strength is made sure
that<00:02:48.570> this<00:02:48.690> visor<00:02:48.930> is<00:02:49.200> going<00:02:49.500> to<00:02:49.680> be<00:02:50.670> a

00:02:50.690 --> 00:02:50.700 
that this visor is going to be a

00:02:50.700 --> 00:02:53.450 
that this visor is going to be a
high-end<00:02:51.150> piece<00:02:51.420> okay<00:02:51.780> it's<00:02:52.460> optically

00:02:53.450 --> 00:02:53.460 
high-end piece okay it's optically

00:02:53.460 --> 00:02:55.390 
high-end piece okay it's optically
correct<00:02:53.610> which<00:02:54.030> means<00:02:54.270> that<00:02:54.420> it<00:02:54.510> was<00:02:54.660> formed

00:02:55.390 --> 00:02:55.400 
correct which means that it was formed

00:02:55.400 --> 00:02:58.340 
correct which means that it was formed
it<00:02:56.400> was<00:02:56.610> it<00:02:56.760> was<00:02:56.850> built<00:02:57.150> on<00:02:57.390> a<00:02:57.450> form<00:02:57.840> it<00:02:57.990> wasn't

00:02:58.340 --> 00:02:58.350 
it was it was built on a form it wasn't

00:02:58.350 --> 00:03:00.080 
it was it was built on a form it wasn't
laid<00:02:58.560> out<00:02:58.710> flat<00:02:58.920> heated<00:02:59.520> and<00:02:59.640> then<00:02:59.760> wrapped

laid out flat heated and then wrapped

00:03:00.090 --> 00:03:02.420 
laid out flat heated and then wrapped
which<00:03:00.720> can<00:03:00.870> cause<00:03:01.050> distortion<00:03:01.710> so<00:03:01.920> by<00:03:02.250> being

00:03:02.420 --> 00:03:02.430 
which can cause distortion so by being

00:03:02.430 --> 00:03:04.610 
which can cause distortion so by being
optically<00:03:02.880> correct<00:03:03.150> you<00:03:03.870> have<00:03:04.050> less

00:03:04.610 --> 00:03:04.620 
optically correct you have less

00:03:04.620 --> 00:03:06.500 
optically correct you have less
distortion<00:03:05.310> out<00:03:05.430> on<00:03:05.580> the<00:03:05.670> road<00:03:05.880> which<00:03:06.120> is<00:03:06.270> one

00:03:06.500 --> 00:03:06.510 
distortion out on the road which is one

00:03:06.510 --> 00:03:08.900 
distortion out on the road which is one
safer<00:03:07.080> and<00:03:07.260> two<00:03:07.620> more<00:03:08.220> comfortable<00:03:08.640> for<00:03:08.700> your

00:03:14.390 --> 00:03:14.400 
always a good thing as far as being able

00:03:14.400 --> 00:03:16.610 
always a good thing as far as being able
to<00:03:14.520> ride<00:03:14.730> for<00:03:14.970> longer<00:03:15.330> distances<00:03:15.620> another

00:03:16.610 --> 00:03:16.620 
to ride for longer distances another

00:03:16.620 --> 00:03:19.750 
to ride for longer distances another
thing<00:03:16.860> about<00:03:17.070> the<00:03:17.310> the<00:03:17.580> visor<00:03:18.530> anti-fog

00:03:19.750 --> 00:03:19.760 
thing about the the visor anti-fog

00:03:19.760 --> 00:03:22.430 
thing about the the visor anti-fog
anti-scratch<00:03:20.760> and<00:03:21.210> it's<00:03:21.660> built<00:03:21.870> to<00:03:21.990> be<00:03:22.110> UV

00:03:22.430 --> 00:03:22.440 
anti-scratch and it's built to be UV

00:03:22.440 --> 00:03:24.050 
anti-scratch and it's built to be UV
resistant<00:03:22.980> so<00:03:23.160> it's<00:03:23.280> going<00:03:23.430> to<00:03:23.490> stay<00:03:23.700> clear

00:03:24.050 --> 00:03:24.060 
resistant so it's going to stay clear

00:03:24.060 --> 00:03:26.990 
resistant so it's going to stay clear
for<00:03:24.390> longer<00:03:24.780> this<00:03:25.560> helmet<00:03:25.800> like<00:03:26.130> I<00:03:26.250> said<00:03:26.310> is<00:03:26.670> a
