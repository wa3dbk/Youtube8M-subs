00:00:27.660 --> 00:00:34.300
 orthodox this anime between mosquera 2 no 

00:00:30.820 --> 00:00:37.780
 we are my youth my adolescence and 

00:00:34.300 --> 00:00:39.870
 Now I like it but that of many and 

00:00:37.780 --> 00:00:43.620
 also some of childhood 

00:00:39.870 --> 00:00:46.559
 it's obvious I'm talking about one piece and 

00:00:43.620 --> 00:00:49.500
 a series that has broken records after 

00:00:46.559 --> 00:00:51.870
 records but well we are already in the 

00:00:49.500 --> 00:00:55.860
 first video of my channel this new 

00:00:51.870 --> 00:01:00.030
 channel that you invited subscribe to 

00:00:55.860 --> 00:01:03.059
 they obviously like to see me and give me 

00:01:00.030 --> 00:01:04.909
 the opinions comments and others that 

00:01:03.059 --> 00:01:08.509
 let's start 

00:01:04.909 --> 00:01:11.719
 first in this video I would like to explain 

00:01:08.509 --> 00:01:14.829
 or give an introduction to this series without 

00:01:11.719 --> 00:01:14.829
 give no spoilers 

00:01:15.210 --> 00:01:21.630
 nothing to do I mean the 

00:01:19.049 --> 00:01:23.040
 first time they see this in my 

00:01:21.630 --> 00:01:26.310
 recommendations and they will see it 

00:01:23.040 --> 00:01:28.979
 first time not because on the internet 

00:01:26.310 --> 00:01:31.580
 I still like the pages of 

00:01:28.979 --> 00:01:37.040
 zombies or anything because 

00:01:31.580 --> 00:01:40.970
 the spoiler is is good for 

00:01:37.040 --> 00:01:43.670
 start a pee it's about pirates no no 

00:01:40.970 --> 00:01:46.040
 they would be pirates but take off your mind 

00:01:43.670 --> 00:01:47.520
 that that image of the pirates that 

00:01:46.040 --> 00:01:50.250
 we have 

00:01:47.520 --> 00:01:53.159
 the conventional stones where nothing 

00:01:50.250 --> 00:01:56.340
 conventional when a story tells 

00:01:53.159 --> 00:01:59.880
 how it starts now not about a child 

00:01:56.340 --> 00:02:02.950
 called montini lutfi which will be the 

00:01:59.880 --> 00:02:05.890
 protagonist of this series 

00:02:02.950 --> 00:02:10.269
 everything starts those seven years when 

00:02:05.890 --> 00:02:12.650
 eat finally a coma not me or better 

00:02:10.269 --> 00:02:16.510
 known as devil fruit 

00:02:12.650 --> 00:02:19.940
 in other videos I will focus more on 

00:02:16.510 --> 00:02:22.670
 accumulated to me with we have 

00:02:19.940 --> 00:02:27.440
 it's like I'm not committed by a man like 

00:02:22.670 --> 00:02:29.110
 the body to stretch at will and without 

00:02:27.440 --> 00:02:33.460
 problem some 

00:02:29.110 --> 00:02:35.740
 good following with the story what 

00:02:33.460 --> 00:02:38.910
 important to tell is the reason 

00:02:35.740 --> 00:02:43.020
 main or the main character 

00:02:38.910 --> 00:02:46.020
 that made this started and I'm 

00:02:43.020 --> 00:02:48.960
 talking about the man known as the king 

00:02:46.020 --> 00:02:53.340
 of the stories the man who had everything 

00:02:48.960 --> 00:02:57.150
 in the world money fame power 

00:02:53.340 --> 00:02:59.459
 a man-goal rust 

00:02:57.150 --> 00:03:02.129
 that he was executed by the 

00:02:59.459 --> 00:03:04.200
 marine but before dying he said his 

00:03:02.129 --> 00:03:06.239
 last words 

00:03:04.200 --> 00:03:08.990
 which made this great 

00:03:06.239 --> 00:03:13.640
 history will begin 

00:03:08.990 --> 00:03:16.280
 and it was when this pirate era began in 

00:03:13.640 --> 00:03:19.100
 which is submerged in the series speaks 

00:03:16.280 --> 00:03:20.770
 about his treasure when people 

00:03:19.100 --> 00:03:22.610
 asks what he did to all 

00:03:20.770 --> 00:03:26.120
 riches 

00:03:22.610 --> 00:03:29.140
 he answers that I leave them hidden in 

00:03:26.120 --> 00:03:31.720
 there referring to an island 

00:03:29.140 --> 00:03:35.520
 hidden migran durand 

00:03:31.720 --> 00:03:37.880
 This is the most dangerous sea 

00:03:35.520 --> 00:03:41.330
 says that the one piece has left it there 

00:03:37.880 --> 00:03:44.370
 it is so thousands of pirates jump into the sea 

00:03:41.330 --> 00:03:48.970
 to start the search and as I said 

00:03:44.370 --> 00:03:53.070
 the great pirate era begins 

00:03:48.970 --> 00:03:57.340
 ok continuing after resuming place 

00:03:53.070 --> 00:03:59.710
 that being inspired by the portrait and 

00:03:57.340 --> 00:04:02.920
 by another pirate called every minute 

00:03:59.710 --> 00:04:07.510
 songs that anchored or that is by the 

00:04:02.920 --> 00:04:10.600
 moment says a mobile is worried 

00:04:07.510 --> 00:04:14.820
 inspires faith is made in a friend of his 

00:04:10.600 --> 00:04:14.820
 and his friend from the entire crew 

00:04:15.230 --> 00:04:21.209
 making a very good friendship even 

00:04:17.850 --> 00:04:25.949
 wanting them to carry it in their 

00:04:21.209 --> 00:04:28.449
 adventures but hanks does not accept 

00:04:25.949 --> 00:04:31.930
 hanks the redhead also known by 

00:04:28.449 --> 00:04:34.720
 the color of your hair 

00:04:31.930 --> 00:04:38.949
 One day some bandit comes in 

00:04:34.720 --> 00:04:41.470
 mountain humiliating the faith they get angry 

00:04:38.949 --> 00:04:44.380
 try to defend it 

00:04:41.470 --> 00:04:47.650
 Perez ignored while humilian hanks 

00:04:44.380 --> 00:04:50.139
 that's when they neglect and it's in that 

00:04:47.650 --> 00:04:53.400
 instant when the doctor takes me up 

00:04:50.139 --> 00:04:57.630
 cumanÃ¡ my continuing 

00:04:53.400 --> 00:05:00.060
 Yang then leaves saved his life 

00:04:57.630 --> 00:05:01.980
 luxury of the golden mountain globe that does not 

00:05:00.060 --> 00:05:06.400
 they were attacking 

00:05:01.980 --> 00:05:09.300
 light and try to rescue try to then 

00:05:06.400 --> 00:05:12.449
 is the smell or defend the honor of your 

00:05:09.300 --> 00:05:16.319
 companions of their beds 

00:05:12.449 --> 00:05:17.689
 is somewhere crucial in the 

00:05:16.319 --> 00:05:22.249
 history 

00:05:17.689 --> 00:05:23.630
 sans salva lutfi risking or giving his 

00:05:22.249 --> 00:05:27.140
 arm 

00:05:23.630 --> 00:05:28.689

00:05:27.140 --> 00:05:33.789

00:05:33.789 --> 00:05:39.410
 will ask you to take it with him 

00:05:35.990 --> 00:05:41.330
 but he will become a pirate by 

00:05:39.410 --> 00:05:44.650
 your own account 

00:05:41.330 --> 00:05:47.539
 and it will become one of the most powerful 

00:05:44.650 --> 00:05:51.069
 even more powerful than listening 

00:05:47.539 --> 00:05:55.009
 these words hanks inspired moved 

00:05:51.069 --> 00:05:57.550
 I decided to leave her badge or whatever 

00:05:55.009 --> 00:06:00.530
 characterizes that he is amazed by straw ' 

00:05:57.550 --> 00:06:04.009

00:06:04.009 --> 00:06:09.270
 great pirate 

00:06:05.990 --> 00:06:13.650

00:06:09.270 --> 00:06:15.510
 to turn 17 he sails his town 

00:06:13.650 --> 00:06:19.969
 natal looking for the camera to 

00:06:15.510 --> 00:06:23.209
