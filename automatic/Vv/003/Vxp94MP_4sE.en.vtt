little bit lumber glitters that kind of
fall<00:02:01.560> down<00:02:01.770> sometimes<00:02:02.340> so

00:02:04.700 --> 00:02:04.710 

00:02:04.710 --> 00:02:06.770 

and<00:02:04.799> now<00:02:05.670> I'm<00:02:05.820> taking<00:02:06.210> just<00:02:06.420> with<00:02:06.540> the<00:02:06.630> same
