00:00:03.740 --> 00:00:03.750 
hey guys I wanted to do a quick

00:00:03.750 --> 00:00:06.230 
hey guys I wanted to do a quick
demonstration<00:00:04.290> of<00:00:05.009> this<00:00:05.279> oh<00:00:05.460> cool<00:00:05.730> ice<00:00:05.910> cream

demonstration of this oh cool ice cream

00:00:06.240 --> 00:00:09.110 
demonstration of this oh cool ice cream
maker<00:00:06.950> so<00:00:07.950> this<00:00:08.130> works<00:00:08.340> pretty<00:00:08.550> similar<00:00:09.090> to

00:00:09.110 --> 00:00:09.120 
maker so this works pretty similar to

00:00:09.120 --> 00:00:11.080 
maker so this works pretty similar to
the<00:00:09.420> way<00:00:09.540> that<00:00:09.570> their<00:00:09.840> quick<00:00:10.050> pop<00:00:10.290> maker<00:00:10.590> works

00:00:11.080 --> 00:00:11.090 
the way that their quick pop maker works

00:00:11.090 --> 00:00:13.910 
the way that their quick pop maker works
they<00:00:12.090> give<00:00:12.480> you<00:00:12.599> a<00:00:12.630> bowl<00:00:12.929> and<00:00:13.590> you're<00:00:13.769> gonna

00:00:13.910 --> 00:00:13.920 
they give you a bowl and you're gonna

00:00:13.920 --> 00:00:16.070 
they give you a bowl and you're gonna
take<00:00:14.219> the<00:00:14.340> bowl<00:00:14.519> and<00:00:14.820> freeze<00:00:15.389> it<00:00:15.599> for<00:00:15.809> in<00:00:15.929> these

00:00:16.070 --> 00:00:16.080 
take the bowl and freeze it for in these

00:00:16.080 --> 00:00:18.620 
take the bowl and freeze it for in these
twelve<00:00:16.440> hours<00:00:16.980> and<00:00:17.250> it<00:00:17.760> gets<00:00:17.910> cold<00:00:18.180> enough<00:00:18.300> so

00:00:18.620 --> 00:00:18.630 
twelve hours and it gets cold enough so

00:00:18.630 --> 00:00:20.000 
twelve hours and it gets cold enough so
that<00:00:18.660> when<00:00:18.869> you<00:00:19.020> put<00:00:19.199> your<00:00:19.230> creamy<00:00:19.680> mixture

00:00:20.000 --> 00:00:20.010 
that when you put your creamy mixture

00:00:20.010 --> 00:00:21.560 
that when you put your creamy mixture
inside<00:00:20.250> its<00:00:20.609> gonna<00:00:20.730> turn<00:00:21.000> it<00:00:21.119> into<00:00:21.240> an<00:00:21.420> ice

00:00:21.560 --> 00:00:21.570 
inside its gonna turn it into an ice

00:00:21.570 --> 00:00:25.279 
inside its gonna turn it into an ice
cream<00:00:22.100> so<00:00:23.100> the<00:00:23.760> bowl<00:00:23.939> actually<00:00:24.449> attaches<00:00:25.109> from

00:00:25.279 --> 00:00:25.289 
cream so the bowl actually attaches from

00:00:25.289 --> 00:00:28.189 
cream so the bowl actually attaches from
the<00:00:25.410> little<00:00:25.650> dish<00:00:25.830> and<00:00:26.359> I've<00:00:27.359> already<00:00:27.570> frozen

00:00:28.189 --> 00:00:28.199 
the little dish and I've already frozen

00:00:28.199 --> 00:00:30.560 
the little dish and I've already frozen
my<00:00:28.289> bow<00:00:28.439> overnight<00:00:29.070> so<00:00:29.760> we're<00:00:30.090> gonna<00:00:30.179> get<00:00:30.390> into

00:00:30.560 --> 00:00:30.570 
my bow overnight so we're gonna get into

00:00:30.570 --> 00:00:36.950 
my bow overnight so we're gonna get into
just<00:00:31.170> how<00:00:31.410> it<00:00:31.830> works<00:00:32.099> in<00:00:32.399> a<00:00:32.669> second<00:00:35.960> so

00:00:36.950 --> 00:00:36.960 
just how it works in a second so

just how it works in a second so
according<00:00:37.410> to<00:00:37.440> the<00:00:37.620> instructions<00:00:38.190> that<00:00:38.280> works

00:00:38.540 --> 00:00:38.550 
according to the instructions that works

00:00:38.550 --> 00:00:41.990 
according to the instructions that works

best with about a five ounce mixture and
I<00:00:42.540> have<00:00:43.230> put<00:00:43.559> together<00:00:43.710> just<00:00:44.399> a<00:00:44.550> simple<00:00:44.969> little

00:00:45.229 --> 00:00:45.239 
I have put together just a simple little

00:00:47.420 --> 00:00:47.430 
vanilla ice cream mixture they give a

00:00:47.430 --> 00:00:49.430 
vanilla ice cream mixture they give a
little<00:00:47.610> recipe<00:00:48.149> books<00:00:48.420> for<00:00:48.690> suggesting<00:00:49.230> guys

00:00:49.430 --> 00:00:49.440

little recipe books for suggesting guys
so<00:00:49.770> I<00:00:49.800> just<00:00:50.070> used<00:00:50.280> a<00:00:50.370> couple<00:00:50.399> asses<00:00:50.850> of<00:00:50.969> males<00:00:51.180> a

00:00:51.290 --> 00:00:51.300

of<00:00:53.460> sugar<00:00:53.730> a<00:00:53.850> little<00:00:54.000> salt<00:00:54.149> and<00:00:54.750> just<00:00:54.989> a

00:00:55.130 --> 00:00:55.140 
of sugar a little salt and just a

00:00:55.140 --> 00:00:57.770 
of sugar a little salt and just a
picture<00:00:55.469> of<00:00:55.559> another<00:00:55.649> extract<00:00:56.660> so<00:00:57.660> we're

00:00:57.770 --> 00:00:57.780 
picture of another extract so we're

00:00:57.780 --> 00:00:59.299 
picture of another extract so we're
gonna<00:00:57.899> just<00:00:58.140> go<00:00:58.260> ahead<00:00:58.440> and<00:00:58.590> pour<00:00:58.859> it<00:00:58.980> in<00:00:59.100> it

00:00:59.299 --> 00:00:59.309 
gonna just go ahead and pour it in it

00:00:59.309 --> 00:01:01.350 
gonna just go ahead and pour it in it
takes<00:00:59.550> about<00:00:59.730> ten<00:01:00.329> minutes

00:01:01.350 --> 00:01:01.360 
takes about ten minutes

00:01:01.360 --> 00:01:05.189 
takes about ten minutes
they<00:01:01.960> think<00:01:02.020> to<00:01:02.880> continuously<00:01:03.880> just<00:01:04.360> use<00:01:04.989> your

00:01:05.189 --> 00:01:05.199 
they think to continuously just use your

00:01:05.199 --> 00:01:07.620 
they think to continuously just use your
spoon<00:01:05.470> to<00:01:05.830> stir<00:01:05.890> around<00:01:06.490> as<00:01:06.790> it<00:01:07.120> thickens<00:01:07.480> on

00:01:07.620 --> 00:01:07.630 
spoon to stir around as it thickens on

00:01:07.630 --> 00:01:09.630 
spoon to stir around as it thickens on
the<00:01:07.720> side<00:01:07.930> so<00:01:08.350> we're<00:01:08.920> just<00:01:09.070> going<00:01:09.250> to<00:01:09.280> pour<00:01:09.580> it

00:01:09.630 --> 00:01:09.640 
the side so we're just going to pour it

00:01:09.640 --> 00:01:29.060 
the side so we're just going to pour it
on<00:01:09.760> in<00:01:09.970> and<00:01:10.150> start<00:01:10.750> there

00:01:29.060 --> 00:01:29.070 

00:01:29.070 --> 00:01:32.319 

all<00:01:29.580> right

00:01:32.319 --> 00:01:32.329 

00:01:32.329 --> 00:01:34.240 

so<00:01:32.750> I'm<00:01:32.810> just<00:01:32.990> gonna<00:01:33.140> spoon<00:01:33.500> this<00:01:33.740> around<00:01:34.070> a

00:01:34.240 --> 00:01:34.250 
so I'm just gonna spoon this around a

00:01:34.250 --> 00:01:37.240 
so I'm just gonna spoon this around a
bit

00:01:37.240 --> 00:01:37.250 

00:01:37.250 --> 00:01:41.530 

so<00:01:38.250> I'm<00:01:38.340> just<00:01:38.520> continuing<00:01:39.420> to<00:01:39.450> churn<00:01:39.990> and<00:01:40.440> I

00:01:41.530 --> 00:01:41.540 
so I'm just continuing to churn and I

00:01:41.540 --> 00:01:44.630 
so I'm just continuing to churn and I
can<00:01:42.540> feel<00:01:42.840> the<00:01:43.020> consistency<00:01:43.230> in<00:01:44.040> some<00:01:44.310> spots

00:01:44.630 --> 00:01:44.640 
can feel the consistency in some spots

00:01:44.640 --> 00:01:48.100 
can feel the consistency in some spots
I'm<00:01:45.630> starting<00:01:46.140> from<00:01:46.320> a<00:01:46.380> liquid<00:01:46.770> into<00:01:46.890> of

00:01:48.100 --> 00:01:48.110 
I'm starting from a liquid into of

00:01:48.110 --> 00:01:53.330 
I'm starting from a liquid into of
frozen<00:01:49.110> free<00:01:49.620> me<00:01:50.750> next<00:01:51.750> and<00:01:52.320> they<00:01:52.860> recommend

00:01:53.330 --> 00:01:53.340 
frozen free me next and they recommend

00:01:53.340 --> 00:01:55.370 
frozen free me next and they recommend
going<00:01:53.640> this<00:01:53.820> continuously<00:01:54.570> a<00:01:54.690> little<00:01:55.200> bit

00:01:55.370 --> 00:01:55.380 
going this continuously a little bit

00:01:55.380 --> 00:01:57.230 
going this continuously a little bit
outside<00:01:55.800> they<00:01:56.520> recommend<00:01:56.970> doing<00:01:57.090> this

00:01:57.230 --> 00:01:57.240 
outside they recommend doing this

00:01:57.240 --> 00:02:01.070 
outside they recommend doing this
continuously<00:01:57.510> for<00:01:58.380> about<00:01:59.420> ten<00:02:00.420> minutes

00:02:01.070 --> 00:02:01.080 
continuously for about ten minutes

00:02:01.080 --> 00:02:03.110 
continuously for about ten minutes
so<00:02:01.260> I'm<00:02:01.470> gonna<00:02:01.650> set<00:02:02.010> the<00:02:02.190> timer<00:02:02.520> and<00:02:02.940> just

00:02:03.110 --> 00:02:03.120 
so I'm gonna set the timer and just

00:02:03.120 --> 00:02:06.260 
so I'm gonna set the timer and just
continue<00:02:03.660> to<00:02:03.690> churn<00:02:04.610> just<00:02:05.610> slowly<00:02:05.850> turn

00:02:06.260 --> 00:02:06.270 
continue to churn just slowly turn

00:02:06.270 --> 00:02:09.320 
continue to churn just slowly turn
around<00:02:06.300> scraping<00:02:07.140> it<00:02:07.230> off<00:02:07.430> of<00:02:08.430> the<00:02:08.610> size<00:02:08.820> as<00:02:09.210> it

00:02:09.320 --> 00:02:09.330 
around scraping it off of the size as it

00:02:09.330 --> 00:02:12.050 
around scraping it off of the size as it
turns<00:02:09.570> into<00:02:09.780> ice<00:02:09.930> cream<00:02:10.380> mixture<00:02:10.710> and<00:02:11.010> I'll<00:02:11.940> be

00:02:12.050 --> 00:02:12.060 
turns into ice cream mixture and I'll be

00:02:12.060 --> 00:02:18.370 
turns into ice cream mixture and I'll be
back<00:02:12.240> in<00:02:12.420> ten<00:02:12.720> minutes<00:02:13.080> to<00:02:13.610> show<00:02:14.610> the<00:02:14.910> results

00:02:18.370 --> 00:02:18.380 

00:02:18.380 --> 00:02:20.990 

okay<00:02:19.380> we're<00:02:19.890> back<00:02:19.980> with<00:02:20.160> our<00:02:20.340> results<00:02:20.490> it's

only been about eight minutes it
actually<00:02:22.560> didn't<00:02:22.860> take<00:02:23.070> ten<00:02:23.400> minutes<00:02:23.730> for

00:02:23.960 --> 00:02:23.970 
actually didn't take ten minutes for

00:02:23.970 --> 00:02:25.310 
actually didn't take ten minutes for
this<00:02:24.210> to<00:02:24.360> turn<00:02:24.510> into<00:02:24.720> an<00:02:24.900> ice<00:02:25.080> cream

00:02:25.310 --> 00:02:25.320 
this to turn into an ice cream

00:02:25.320 --> 00:02:27.080 
this to turn into an ice cream
consistency<00:02:25.850> um
