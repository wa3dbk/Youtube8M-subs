00:00:00.469 --> 00:00:06.680
 hello to you Elena god and today 

00:00:04.319 --> 00:00:09.000
 I present to your attention 

00:00:06.680 --> 00:00:09.960
 skimmed liquid makeup remover 

00:00:09.000 --> 00:00:12.360
 out of sight 

00:00:09.960 --> 00:00:17.190
 This is an excellent tool that will help. 

00:00:12.360 --> 00:00:20.400
 you remove any cosmetics with skin in 

00:00:17.190 --> 00:00:24.410
 eye area in case you need to 

00:00:20.400 --> 00:00:27.689
 all face look if you 

00:00:24.410 --> 00:00:30.689
 note you will see that this 

00:00:27.689 --> 00:00:34.200
 fluid it has two phases upper a 

00:00:30.689 --> 00:00:37.559
 it contains silicone and therefore despite 

00:00:34.200 --> 00:00:40.020
 on the fact that the remedy is degreased when you 

00:00:37.559 --> 00:00:42.300
 apply it on the skin but take it off 

00:00:40.020 --> 00:00:44.309
 using makeup and then try 

00:00:42.300 --> 00:00:47.250
 a little skin you feel like she 's 

00:00:44.309 --> 00:00:49.020
 would be hydrated and as if such 

00:00:47.250 --> 00:00:51.780
 a little indelible holes 

00:00:49.020 --> 00:00:54.420
 that's actually not fat it's that 

00:00:51.780 --> 00:00:57.420
 that's silicone content he's fine 

00:00:54.420 --> 00:01:02.280
 removes all waterproof types of cosmetics 

00:00:57.420 --> 00:01:04.830
 waterproof mascara shade liner and so 

00:01:02.280 --> 00:01:08.939
 further so on and lower and lower part 

00:01:04.830 --> 00:01:10.830
 it is already such a light emulsifier which 

00:01:08.939 --> 00:01:13.650
 easily removes the rest 

00:01:10.830 --> 00:01:17.970
 not waterproof makeup to use very 

00:01:13.650 --> 00:01:21.600
 pleasant thanks to the fact that such here 

00:01:17.970 --> 00:01:27.689
 inert compound it allows not 

00:01:21.600 --> 00:01:29.909
 to stretch the skin not to damage it and then 

00:01:27.689 --> 00:01:32.310
 same time taking care and thanks 

00:01:29.909 --> 00:01:34.290
 lack of fat can easily be used 

00:01:32.310 --> 00:01:38.189
 and those women who wear contact 

00:01:34.290 --> 00:01:38.930
 lenses false eyelashes what else are we with 

00:01:38.189 --> 00:01:41.189
 do you 

00:01:38.930 --> 00:01:44.579
 very easy to use before 

00:01:41.189 --> 00:01:45.270
 using this suspension is necessary 

00:01:44.579 --> 00:01:47.729
 to shake up 

00:01:45.270 --> 00:01:51.299
 in such a way that appeared 

00:01:47.729 --> 00:01:53.220
 see how the stump is when she 

00:01:51.299 --> 00:01:54.930
 you only new it may not be foam 

00:01:53.220 --> 00:01:58.170
 but you will see that she is good enough 

00:01:54.930 --> 00:02:02.390
 mixed and then we put a little 

00:01:58.170 --> 00:02:03.610
 quantity on napkins I am by the way for 

00:02:02.390 --> 00:02:07.060
 I use 

00:02:03.610 --> 00:02:10.630
 Here are such napkins disposable napkins 

00:02:07.060 --> 00:02:14.110
 2 sections from us we can order them 

00:02:10.630 --> 00:02:18.870
 30 pieces are so big so for now 

00:02:14.110 --> 00:02:21.940
 I will put here such big towels 

00:02:18.870 --> 00:02:24.760
 I'll show you these right now 

00:02:21.940 --> 00:02:27.880
 big things i just like 

00:02:24.760 --> 00:02:31.150
 scissors cut into such squares 

00:02:27.880 --> 00:02:34.020
 convenient for me to form squares because 

00:02:31.150 --> 00:02:38.350
 that is easier than my convenient size 

00:02:34.020 --> 00:02:40.930
 you can use cotton pads but 

00:02:38.350 --> 00:02:42.970
 What is the difference in the first cotton disks 

00:02:40.930 --> 00:02:45.070
 still contain such villus glasses 

00:02:42.970 --> 00:02:47.010
 which sometimes interfere here on these 

00:02:45.070 --> 00:02:48.250
 napkins but no extra 

00:02:47.010 --> 00:02:52.209
 lint 

00:02:48.250 --> 00:02:55.709
 there is nothing superfluous in the eye 

00:02:52.209 --> 00:02:57.180
 will hit the opera in the second if for you 

00:02:55.709 --> 00:03:00.130
 is important 

00:02:57.180 --> 00:03:02.980
 economical use of funds then for 

00:03:00.130 --> 00:03:06.580
 comparisons using cotton pads if 

00:03:02.980 --> 00:03:09.880
 you will use the disks then this 

00:03:06.580 --> 00:03:12.160
 you have enough money for 3 months 

00:03:09.880 --> 00:03:14.560
 when using such napkins 

00:03:12.160 --> 00:03:16.720
 you will use it five six 

00:03:14.560 --> 00:03:21.519
 seven months with the same 

00:03:16.720 --> 00:03:24.420
 same mode with chatting so and 

00:03:21.519 --> 00:03:28.209
 we put a small amount of funds on 

00:03:24.420 --> 00:03:28.959
 napkin and remove makeup upper eyelids 

00:03:28.209 --> 00:03:33.480
 to the place 

00:03:28.959 --> 00:03:36.220
 lower to the nose now show you for 

00:03:33.480 --> 00:03:38.430
 believability here for example I put 

00:03:36.220 --> 00:03:41.860
 pencil 

00:03:38.430 --> 00:03:44.739
 ordinary eyeliner here look 

00:03:41.860 --> 00:03:46.930
 so how tomi orient to 

00:03:44.739 --> 00:03:51.400
 camera and here is one motion 

00:03:46.930 --> 00:03:54.519
 horrible did not fall very easily song 

00:03:51.400 --> 00:03:57.130
 Does it allow you to delete 

00:03:54.519 --> 00:04:00.130
 makeup ease so that the hands move 

00:03:57.130 --> 00:04:02.820
 skin stays in place very well 

00:04:00.130 --> 00:04:04.660
 let's use it 

00:04:02.820 --> 00:04:06.820
 experiment try it 

00:04:04.660 --> 00:04:09.220
 a great tool to your customers 

00:04:06.820 --> 00:04:12.010
 friends but in my opinion the thing that 

00:04:09.220 --> 00:04:14.020
 irreplaceable and by the way fine 

00:04:12.010 --> 00:04:15.730
 a gift because you always need 

00:04:14.020 --> 00:04:17.470
 and you do not know what cosmetics to give 

00:04:15.730 --> 00:04:18.730
 women crush her removal fluid 

00:04:17.470 --> 00:04:20.770
 eye cosmetics 

00:04:18.730 --> 00:04:23.080
 necessarily and will even enjoy 

00:04:20.770 --> 00:04:25.900
 if one she already has an extra one is not exactly 

00:04:23.080 --> 00:04:28.500
 will be but you are in the very next meeting 

00:04:25.900 --> 00:04:28.500
 until
