 However there are many people who do not

 I'm not hungry so I'm going to 

00:00:43.800 --> 00:00:48.270
 lunch once good it seems weird 

00:00:46.649 --> 00:00:50.550
 but not having breakfast brings many 

00:00:48.270 --> 00:00:53.030
 bodily problems both within 

00:00:50.550 --> 00:00:55.710
 our stomach like in the whole body 

00:00:53.030 --> 00:00:57.270
 so we'll give you four reasons that you should 

00:00:55.710 --> 00:01:01.800
 take into account so you have to 

00:00:57.270 --> 00:01:03.510
 breakfast 1 weight control there are 

00:01:01.800 --> 00:01:05.790
 many scientific results that 

00:01:03.510 --> 00:01:07.000
 they claim that people who eat breakfast 

00:01:05.790 --> 00:01:09.970
 tend to be thin 

00:01:07.000 --> 00:01:12.280
 but for what reason the body has a 

00:01:09.970 --> 00:01:14.710
 defense which acts when there is no 

00:01:12.280 --> 00:01:16.930
 many foods the defense is that if not 

00:01:14.710 --> 00:01:18.610
 there is food in the stomach the body 

00:01:16.930 --> 00:01:20.979
 tells the intestines to try 

00:01:18.610 --> 00:01:22.840
 absorb all the fats that the 

00:01:20.979 --> 00:01:25.270
 whole body tries to save all the 

00:01:22.840 --> 00:01:26.979
 fat that can this is a defense for 

00:01:25.270 --> 00:01:30.130
 that can have energies in times 

00:01:26.979 --> 00:01:32.619
 bad think that another one of the problems 

00:01:30.130 --> 00:01:34.240
 at lunch he has a great hunger for 

00:01:32.619 --> 00:01:36.700
 the problem of not having breakfast and 

00:01:34.240 --> 00:01:40.350
 has not satiated feeling thus 

00:01:36.700 --> 00:01:42.850
 that I eat in excess 2 better nutrition 

00:01:40.350 --> 00:01:45.190
 many of the foods that we eat in 

00:01:42.850 --> 00:01:48.610
 the morning tend to be very nutritious 

00:01:45.190 --> 00:01:50.350
 since fruits dried fruits cereals 

00:01:48.610 --> 00:01:52.270
 and other low-fat products and 

00:01:50.350 --> 00:01:53.979
 we also can not rule out dairy 

00:01:52.270 --> 00:01:57.009
 which is a very important source of 

00:01:53.979 --> 00:01:58.930
 calcium since normally a person does not 

00:01:57.009 --> 00:02:01.090
 he ingests this kind of food in another 

00:01:58.930 --> 00:02:02.860
 time of day so it would be a good 

00:02:01.090 --> 00:02:05.610
 way to ingest at the time of the morning 

00:02:02.860 --> 00:02:08.759
 as a nutritious breakfast 

00:02:05.610 --> 00:02:10.649
 and physical energy many people do not 

00:02:08.759 --> 00:02:12.900
 they think that breakfast provides 

00:02:10.649 --> 00:02:15.300
 energy for the whole day this does 

00:02:12.900 --> 00:02:16.860
 very important the energy gives it to be 

00:02:15.300 --> 00:02:18.660
 the first hours that the body has not 

00:02:16.860 --> 00:02:20.460
 received no food for many 

00:02:18.660 --> 00:02:23.280
 hours and for this reason has the tank 

00:02:20.460 --> 00:02:25.200
 empty so to speak for this reason 

00:02:23.280 --> 00:02:26.910
 all breakfasts have to have a 

00:02:25.200 --> 00:02:28.440
 moderate amount of protein and 

00:02:26.910 --> 00:02:31.740
 carbohydrates since these substances 

00:02:28.440 --> 00:02:35.100
 they are the ones that give strength all day 4 

00:02:31.740 --> 00:02:36.870
 mental energy also one of the things 

00:02:35.100 --> 00:02:39.180
 important of all breakfast is that 

00:02:36.870 --> 00:02:41.250
 feed our brain this by having 

00:02:39.180 --> 00:02:43.340
 many energy needs tend to 

00:02:41.250 --> 00:02:46.380
 consume large amounts of calories 

00:02:43.340 --> 00:02:48.120
 proteins and carbohydrates for this reason 

00:02:46.380 --> 00:02:50.220
 by not eating any food by the 

00:02:48.120 --> 00:02:52.530
 tomorrow people tend to think 

00:02:50.220 --> 00:02:55.020
 less to be slow in learning 

00:02:52.530 --> 00:02:56.970
 this means that every student and 

00:02:55.020 --> 00:02:58.560
 worked must have breakfast to have 

00:02:56.970 --> 00:03:01.200
 enough energy to 

00:02:58.560 --> 00:03:02.790
 provide them to the brain of this 

00:03:01.200 --> 00:03:04.080
 way to see the great importance of 

00:03:02.790 --> 00:03:06.420
 have a good breakfast 

00:03:04.080 --> 00:03:08.040
 we hope these tips will open the 

00:03:06.420 --> 00:03:10.260
 mind to know that instead of being a 

00:03:08.040 --> 00:03:13.130
 benefit not to eat think that you 

00:03:10.260 --> 00:03:13.130
 you are doing harm
