00:03:39.360 --> 00:03:39.370 
to the side which is really exciting

00:03:39.370 --> 00:03:41.730

00:03:47.660 --> 00:03:47.670 
obviously that one doctor thinks that

00:03:47.670 --> 00:03:50.640 
obviously that one doctor thinks that
having<00:03:48.670> care<00:03:49.060> over<00:03:49.300> your<00:03:49.420> eye<00:03:49.450> causes<00:03:50.410> lady
