40 minutes on up to an hour then I don't
then<00:02:05.549> I<00:02:05.610> don't<00:02:05.820> recommend<00:02:06.090> volume<00:02:06.570> but<00:02:07.229> if

00:02:07.310 --> 00:02:07.320 
then I don't recommend volume but if

00:02:07.320 --> 00:02:08.600 
then I don't recommend volume but if
you're<00:02:07.439> training<00:02:07.740> what<00:02:08.009> I<00:02:08.039> want<00:02:08.250> you<00:02:08.340> to<00:02:08.399> do<00:02:08.520> is

00:02:08.600 --> 00:02:08.610 
you're training what I want you to do is

00:02:08.610 --> 00:02:10.369 
you're training what I want you to do is
if<00:02:08.729> you're<00:02:08.819> training<00:02:09.119> for<00:02:09.239> 20<00:02:09.660> or<00:02:09.720> 30<00:02:10.050> minutes

00:02:10.369 --> 00:02:10.379 
if you're training for 20 or 30 minutes

00:02:10.379 --> 00:02:13.100 
if you're training for 20 or 30 minutes
at<00:02:10.500> a<00:02:11.129> time<00:02:11.400> or<00:02:11.610> a<00:02:11.640> day<00:02:11.819> I'm<00:02:12.000> sorry<00:02:12.239> then<00:02:12.750> I<00:02:12.840> want

00:02:13.100 --> 00:02:13.110 
at a time or a day I'm sorry then I want

00:02:13.110 --> 00:02:13.530 
at a time or a day I'm sorry then I want
you<00:02:13.260> to

00:02:13.530 --> 00:02:13.540 
you to

00:02:13.540 --> 00:02:16.410 
you to
increase<00:02:13.780> your<00:02:13.959> volume<00:02:14.640> by<00:02:15.640> fifteen<00:02:16.299> or

00:02:16.410 --> 00:02:16.420 
increase your volume by fifteen or

00:02:16.420 --> 00:02:19.140 
increase your volume by fifteen or
twenty<00:02:16.689> percent<00:02:16.829> and<00:02:17.829> and<00:02:18.099> then<00:02:18.609> the<00:02:18.939> density

00:02:19.140 --> 00:02:19.150 
twenty percent and and then the density

00:02:19.150 --> 00:02:22.770 
twenty percent and and then the density
put<00:02:19.569> pieces<00:02:20.200> this<00:02:20.409> so<00:02:20.890> density<00:02:21.159> says<00:02:21.489> do<00:02:22.060> more

00:02:22.770 --> 00:02:22.780 
put pieces this so density says do more

00:02:22.780 --> 00:02:25.349 
put pieces this so density says do more
in<00:02:23.079> the<00:02:23.409> same<00:02:23.680> amount<00:02:24.069> of<00:02:24.159> time<00:02:24.400> so<00:02:24.760> if<00:02:25.000> you're

00:02:25.349 --> 00:02:25.359 
in the same amount of time so if you're

00:02:25.359 --> 00:02:27.720 
in the same amount of time so if you're
working<00:02:25.540> out<00:02:25.810> for<00:02:26.200> an<00:02:26.260> hour<00:02:26.469> what<00:02:27.310> I<00:02:27.340> want<00:02:27.579> you

00:02:27.720 --> 00:02:27.730 
working out for an hour what I want you

00:02:27.730 --> 00:02:29.160 
working out for an hour what I want you
to<00:02:27.849> do<00:02:28.000> is<00:02:28.150> I<00:02:28.180> want<00:02:28.450> you<00:02:28.540> to<00:02:28.659> essentially

00:02:29.160 --> 00:02:29.170 
to do is I want you to essentially

00:02:29.170 --> 00:02:31.619 
to do is I want you to essentially
finish<00:02:29.530> that<00:02:29.680> same<00:02:29.920> work<00:02:30.159> out<00:02:30.370> in<00:02:30.579> ten<00:02:31.269> percent

00:02:31.619 --> 00:02:31.629 
finish that same work out in ten percent

00:02:31.629 --> 00:02:34.140 
finish that same work out in ten percent
or<00:02:31.689> 15<00:02:31.989> percent<00:02:32.019> less<00:02:32.620> time<00:02:32.890> all<00:02:33.370> right<00:02:33.430> and

00:02:34.140 --> 00:02:34.150 
or 15 percent less time all right and

00:02:34.150 --> 00:02:35.759 
or 15 percent less time all right and
I'll<00:02:34.269> show<00:02:34.420> you<00:02:34.450> what<00:02:34.989> you<00:02:35.109> can<00:02:35.290> do<00:02:35.500> to

00:02:35.759 --> 00:02:35.769 
I'll show you what you can do to

00:02:35.769 --> 00:02:36.899 
I'll show you what you can do to
manipulate<00:02:36.189> this

00:02:36.899 --> 00:02:36.909 
manipulate this

00:02:36.909 --> 00:02:40.589 
manipulate this
the<00:02:37.269> first<00:02:37.510> one<00:02:37.720> is<00:02:38.069> sets<00:02:39.239> all<00:02:40.239> right<00:02:40.359> so<00:02:40.510> if

00:02:40.589 --> 00:02:40.599 
the first one is sets all right so if

00:02:40.599 --> 00:02:41.819 
the first one is sets all right so if
you're<00:02:40.720> training<00:02:40.930> for<00:02:41.019> a<00:02:41.170> volume<00:02:41.379> you<00:02:41.680> can

00:02:41.819 --> 00:02:41.829 
you're training for a volume you can

00:02:41.829 --> 00:02:43.830 
you're training for a volume you can
increase<00:02:42.099> the<00:02:42.220> number<00:02:42.430> of<00:02:42.459> sets<00:02:42.760> the<00:02:43.000> other

00:02:43.830 --> 00:02:43.840 
increase the number of sets the other

00:02:43.840 --> 00:02:45.179 
increase the number of sets the other
thing<00:02:44.019> that<00:02:44.049> you<00:02:44.230> can<00:02:44.409> do<00:02:44.530> is<00:02:44.739> increase<00:02:45.129> the

00:02:45.179 --> 00:02:45.189 
thing that you can do is increase the

00:02:45.189 --> 00:02:48.149 
thing that you can do is increase the
number<00:02:45.310> of<00:02:45.609> reps<00:02:46.379> if<00:02:47.379> you're<00:02:47.829> training<00:02:48.069> for

00:02:48.149 --> 00:02:48.159 
number of reps if you're training for

00:02:48.159 --> 00:02:51.780

between sets what I want you to do is I
want<00:02:56.319> you<00:02:56.379> to<00:02:56.470> decrease<00:02:57.040> your<00:02:57.310> rest<00:02:57.579> time<00:02:57.849> to

00:02:58.409 --> 00:02:58.419 
want you to decrease your rest time to

00:02:58.419 --> 00:03:01.860 
want you to decrease your rest time to
thirty<00:02:58.750> Seconds<00:02:59.260> time<00:02:59.709> in<00:02:59.980> between<00:03:00.370> sets<00:03:00.870> that

00:03:12.690 --> 00:03:12.700 
for five minutes at a crack you need to

00:03:12.700 --> 00:03:14.970 
for five minutes at a crack you need to
stay<00:03:12.879> focused<00:03:13.120> and<00:03:13.510> you<00:03:13.959> need<00:03:14.139> to<00:03:14.290> work<00:03:14.470> on<00:03:14.680> on

00:03:14.970 --> 00:03:14.980 
stay focused and you need to work on on

00:03:14.980 --> 00:03:17.520 
stay focused and you need to work on on
these<00:03:15.639> two<00:03:15.879> things<00:03:15.909> as<00:03:16.389> a<00:03:16.450> result<00:03:16.900> of<00:03:17.200> changing

00:03:17.520 --> 00:03:17.530 
these two things as a result of changing

00:03:17.530 --> 00:03:18.689 
these two things as a result of changing
up<00:03:17.620> your<00:03:17.769> routine<00:03:17.979> the<00:03:18.159> other<00:03:18.310> thing<00:03:18.489> that<00:03:18.519> you

00:03:18.689 --> 00:03:18.699 
up your routine the other thing that you

00:03:18.699 --> 00:03:21.750 
up your routine the other thing that you
can<00:03:18.819> do<00:03:18.970> here<00:03:19.269> is<00:03:19.889> increase<00:03:20.889> or<00:03:21.129> decrease

00:03:21.750 --> 00:03:21.760 
can do here is increase or decrease

00:03:21.760 --> 00:03:24.390 
can do here is increase or decrease
weight<00:03:22.209> depending<00:03:22.690> on<00:03:22.900> if<00:03:23.859> you're<00:03:24.040> training

00:03:24.390 --> 00:03:24.400 
weight depending on if you're training

00:03:24.400 --> 00:03:26.099 
weight depending on if you're training
if<00:03:24.909> you're<00:03:25.030> increasing<00:03:25.269> your<00:03:25.599> volume<00:03:25.930> or

00:03:26.099 --> 00:03:26.109 
if you're increasing your volume or

00:03:26.109 --> 00:03:28.740 
if you're increasing your volume or
you're<00:03:26.440> increasing<00:03:26.680> your<00:03:26.889> density<00:03:27.510> very<00:03:28.510> very

00:03:28.740 --> 00:03:28.750 
you're increasing your density very very

00:03:28.750 --> 00:03:30.360 
you're increasing your density very very
important<00:03:29.229> now<00:03:29.319> I<00:03:29.349> know<00:03:29.440> this<00:03:29.680> may<00:03:30.099> sound

00:03:30.360 --> 00:03:30.370 
important now I know this may sound

00:03:30.370 --> 00:03:32.819 
important now I know this may sound
confusing<00:03:30.669> it<00:03:31.180> I<00:03:31.329> literally<00:03:32.169> could<00:03:32.440> record

00:03:32.819 --> 00:03:32.829 
confusing it I literally could record

00:03:32.829 --> 00:03:35.610 
confusing it I literally could record
and<00:03:33.069> talk<00:03:33.250> about<00:03:33.579> volume<00:03:34.180> and<00:03:34.449> density<00:03:34.620> for

00:03:35.610 --> 00:03:35.620 
and talk about volume and density for

00:03:35.620 --> 00:03:37.589 
and talk about volume and density for
hours<00:03:35.979> because<00:03:36.310> it's<00:03:36.639> it<00:03:36.879> could<00:03:37.299> be<00:03:37.389> that

00:03:37.589 --> 00:03:37.599 
hours because it's it could be that

00:03:37.599 --> 00:03:40.110 
hours because it's it could be that
involved<00:03:38.139> what<00:03:38.590> I'm<00:03:38.680> going<00:03:38.859> to<00:03:38.919> do<00:03:39.069> is<00:03:39.250> below
