00:00:23.990 --> 00:00:24.000 
in the audio technique ATR 6550 was

00:00:24.000 --> 00:00:27.139 
in the audio technique ATR 6550 was
because<00:00:24.570> the<00:00:24.960> actual<00:00:25.349> audio<00:00:25.710> that<00:00:26.130> the<00:00:26.759> EOS

00:00:27.139 --> 00:00:27.149 
because the actual audio that the EOS

00:00:27.149 --> 00:00:29.749 
because the actual audio that the EOS
mark<00:00:27.480> two<00:00:27.689> is<00:00:27.960> actually<00:00:28.110> putting<00:00:28.500> out<00:00:28.759> really

00:00:29.749 --> 00:00:29.759

something<00:00:32.430> that's<00:00:32.700> gonna<00:00:32.910> have<00:00:33.120> a<00:00:33.149> little<00:00:33.420> bit

know it looks really nice I've seen a
lot<00:02:46.930> of<00:02:47.080> other<00:02:47.440> ones<00:02:47.680> that<00:02:47.830> are<00:02:47.920> kind<00:02:48.100> of<00:02:48.130> small

00:02:48.300 --> 00:02:48.310 
lot of other ones that are kind of small

00:02:48.310 --> 00:02:50.400 
lot of other ones that are kind of small
like<00:02:48.700> ends<00:02:48.880> right<00:02:49.120> here<00:02:49.180> it<00:02:50.080> doesn't<00:02:50.380> look

00:02:50.400 --> 00:02:50.410 
like ends right here it doesn't look

00:02:50.410 --> 00:02:52.500 
like ends right here it doesn't look
like<00:02:50.620> it<00:02:50.800> can<00:02:51.100> actually<00:02:51.640> capture<00:02:52.150> the

00:02:52.500 --> 00:02:52.510 
like it can actually capture the

00:02:52.510 --> 00:02:55.380 
like it can actually capture the
distance<00:02:53.080> of<00:02:53.980> audio<00:02:54.430> but<00:02:54.910> this<00:02:55.030> looks<00:02:55.210> like

00:02:55.380 --> 00:02:55.390 
distance of audio but this looks like

00:02:55.390 --> 00:02:58.260 
distance of audio but this looks like
it's<00:02:55.660> got<00:02:55.810> a<00:02:55.870> nice<00:02:56.350> reach<00:02:56.730> and<00:02:57.730> I'll<00:02:57.850> plugs<00:02:58.120> in

00:02:58.260 --> 00:02:58.270 
it's got a nice reach and I'll plugs in

00:02:58.270 --> 00:03:00.660 
it's got a nice reach and I'll plugs in
right<00:02:58.300> on<00:02:58.570> the<00:02:58.660> side<00:02:58.900> and<00:02:59.290> here's<00:03:00.040> your<00:03:00.160> two

00:03:00.660 --> 00:03:00.670 
right on the side and here's your two

00:03:00.670 --> 00:03:04.830 
right on the side and here's your two
modes<00:03:01.140> normal<00:03:02.140> telly<00:03:02.830> I<00:03:03.130> think<00:03:03.940> on<00:03:04.060> the<00:03:04.090> 7d

00:03:04.830 --> 00:03:04.840 
modes normal telly I think on the 7d

00:03:04.840 --> 00:03:06.449 
modes normal telly I think on the 7d
there's<00:03:05.320> a<00:03:05.410> setting<00:03:05.800> that<00:03:05.980> you<00:03:06.190> have<00:03:06.340> to

00:03:06.449 --> 00:03:06.459 
there's a setting that you have to

00:03:06.459 --> 00:03:10.160 
there's a setting that you have to
change<00:03:06.820> but<00:03:07.540> on<00:03:07.720> the<00:03:07.959> mark<00:03:08.200> two<00:03:08.500> it<00:03:08.950> just<00:03:09.610> goes

00:03:10.160 --> 00:03:10.170 
change but on the mark two it just goes

00:03:10.170 --> 00:03:12.240 
change but on the mark two it just goes
right<00:03:11.170> to<00:03:11.380> the<00:03:11.410> mic<00:03:11.650> you<00:03:11.800> know<00:03:11.890> to<00:03:12.070> set

00:03:12.240 --> 00:03:12.250 
right to the mic you know to set

00:03:12.250 --> 00:03:13.320 
right to the mic you know to set
anything<00:03:12.459> up<00:03:12.700> just<00:03:12.970> make<00:03:13.090> sure<00:03:13.209> your

00:03:13.320 --> 00:03:13.330 
anything up just make sure your

00:03:13.330 --> 00:03:17.730 
anything up just make sure your
microphone<00:03:13.720> settings<00:03:13.959> on<00:03:14.310> so<00:03:15.990> now<00:03:16.990> we're

00:03:17.730 --> 00:03:17.740 
microphone settings on so now we're

00:03:17.740 --> 00:03:19.940 
microphone settings on so now we're
going<00:03:17.830> to<00:03:17.890> put<00:03:17.950> it<00:03:18.160> to<00:03:18.250> the<00:03:18.280> test<00:03:18.520> this<00:03:19.180> is<00:03:19.480> just

00:03:19.940 --> 00:03:19.950 
going to put it to the test this is just

00:03:19.950 --> 00:03:24.480 
going to put it to the test this is just
the<00:03:20.950> basic<00:03:21.660> setting<00:03:22.660> for<00:03:23.290> the<00:03:23.470> canon<00:03:23.800> eos<00:03:24.190> 5d

the basic setting for the canon eos 5d
mark<00:03:24.730> two<00:03:25.350> this<00:03:26.350> is<00:03:26.470> what<00:03:26.590> the<00:03:26.680> audio<00:03:26.980> sounds

00:03:27.420 --> 00:03:27.430 
mark two this is what the audio sounds

00:03:27.430 --> 00:03:31.590 
mark two this is what the audio sounds
like<00:03:27.610> just<00:03:28.769> now<00:03:29.769> this<00:03:29.950> is<00:03:30.160> normal<00:03:30.550> mode<00:03:30.730> it's

00:03:31.590 --> 00:03:31.600

00:03:35.500 --> 00:03:37.560 
feet away it's got like a little bit
more<00:03:35.650> bass<00:03:35.950> and<00:03:36.430> the<00:03:36.459> trouble<00:03:36.910> kind<00:03:37.120> of<00:03:37.269> levels

ABS not so high and it looks like it's a

00:03:40.300 --> 00:03:43.370 
ABS not so high and it looks like it's a
lot<00:03:40.450> easier<00:03:40.480> to<00:03:41.230> edit<00:03:42.010> as<00:03:42.370> opposed<00:03:43.060> to<00:03:43.209> just

00:03:43.370 --> 00:03:43.380 
lot easier to edit as opposed to just

00:03:43.380 --> 00:03:45.920 
lot easier to edit as opposed to just
working<00:03:44.380> just<00:03:44.500> off<00:03:44.680> a<00:03:44.709> treble<00:03:45.220> kind<00:03:45.459> of<00:03:45.580> sound

working just off a treble kind of sound
you<00:03:46.930> know<00:03:47.050> you<00:03:47.110> can<00:03:47.290> really<00:03:47.500> just<00:03:47.680> like<00:03:47.860> use<00:03:48.130> an

00:03:48.240 --> 00:03:48.250 
you know you can really just like use an

00:03:48.250 --> 00:03:50.940 
you know you can really just like use an
equalizer<00:03:48.700> and<00:03:49.090> balance<00:03:49.690> everything<00:03:49.959> now

00:03:50.940 --> 00:03:50.950 
equalizer and balance everything now

00:03:50.950 --> 00:03:53.280 
equalizer and balance everything now

00:03:55.979 --> 00:03:55.989 
like now when I tried it before before I

00:03:55.989 --> 00:03:57.360 
like now when I tried it before before I
actually<00:03:56.140> recorded<00:03:56.709> it<00:03:56.830> it<00:03:56.980> sounds<00:03:57.250> like<00:03:57.310> a

00:03:57.360 --> 00:03:57.370 
actually recorded it it sounds like a

00:03:57.370 --> 00:03:59.759 
actually recorded it it sounds like a
little<00:03:57.519> bit<00:03:57.730> brighter<00:03:58.000> and<00:03:58.500> it's<00:03:59.500> like<00:03:59.650> the

little bit brighter and it's like the

little bit brighter and it's like the
troubles<00:04:00.100> high<00:04:00.310> basis<00:04:01.180> a<00:04:01.209> little<00:04:01.480> bit<00:04:01.600> lower

00:04:01.740 --> 00:04:01.750 
troubles high basis a little bit lower

00:04:01.750 --> 00:04:05.970 
troubles high basis a little bit lower
but<00:04:01.959> it's<00:04:02.140> like<00:04:03.090> it's<00:04:04.090> good<00:04:04.450> I<00:04:04.720> prefer<00:04:05.320> to<00:04:05.830> do

00:04:15.930 --> 00:04:15.940 
so basically learning together and

00:04:15.940 --> 00:04:17.759 
so basically learning together and
testing<00:04:16.209> it<00:04:16.269> together<00:04:16.570> okay<00:04:17.200> I'm<00:04:17.320> about<00:04:17.560> five
