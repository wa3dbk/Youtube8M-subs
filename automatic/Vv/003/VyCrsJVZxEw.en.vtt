00:00:14.209 --> 00:00:14.219 
we can try and do it and give jagex

00:00:14.219 --> 00:00:16.070 
we can try and do it and give jagex
ideas<00:00:14.730> and<00:00:15.089> they<00:00:15.240> can<00:00:15.389> work<00:00:15.509> off<00:00:15.719> of<00:00:15.750> them<00:00:15.960> I

00:00:16.070 --> 00:00:16.080 
ideas and they can work off of them I

00:00:22.609 --> 00:00:22.619 
something i don't know what the

00:00:22.619 --> 00:00:23.990 
something i don't know what the
repercussion<00:00:23.250> is<00:00:23.369> so<00:00:23.519> when<00:00:23.670> I<00:00:23.699> say<00:00:23.970> something

00:00:23.990 --> 00:00:24.000 
repercussion is so when I say something

00:00:24.000 --> 00:00:25.759 
repercussion is so when I say something
I<00:00:24.449> don't<00:00:24.720> want<00:00:24.840> people<00:00:25.109> to<00:00:25.230> take<00:00:25.380> it<00:00:25.560> too

00:00:25.759 --> 00:00:25.769 
I don't want people to take it too

00:00:25.769 --> 00:00:27.529 
I don't want people to take it too
heavily<00:00:26.130> because<00:00:26.519> I'm<00:00:26.789> not<00:00:27.060> really<00:00:27.269> thinking

00:00:27.529 --> 00:00:27.539 
heavily because I'm not really thinking

00:00:27.539 --> 00:00:29.390 
heavily because I'm not really thinking
about<00:00:27.779> how<00:00:28.050> it<00:00:28.170> affects<00:00:28.439> every<00:00:28.830> single<00:00:29.160> player

00:00:29.390 --> 00:00:29.400 
about how it affects every single player

00:00:29.400 --> 00:00:31.279 
about how it affects every single player
whereas<00:00:29.880> jagex<00:00:30.330> has<00:00:30.539> two<00:00:30.779> that's<00:00:31.080> there

00:00:31.279 --> 00:00:31.289 
whereas jagex has two that's there

00:00:31.289 --> 00:00:33.200 
whereas jagex has two that's there
that's<00:00:31.320> what<00:00:31.800> they<00:00:31.949> do<00:00:32.009> when<00:00:32.430> they<00:00:32.550> release<00:00:33.030> an

00:00:33.200 --> 00:00:33.210 
that's what they do when they release an

00:00:33.210 --> 00:00:35.360 
that's what they do when they release an
update<00:00:33.329> they<00:00:33.780> almost<00:00:33.960> always<00:00:34.290> work<00:00:35.040> for

00:00:35.360 --> 00:00:35.370 
update they almost always work for

00:00:35.370 --> 00:00:36.590 
update they almost always work for
months<00:00:35.610> thinking<00:00:35.880> about<00:00:36.120> the<00:00:36.329> repercussions

00:00:36.590 --> 00:00:36.600 
months thinking about the repercussions

00:00:36.600 --> 00:00:39.229 
months thinking about the repercussions
and<00:00:37.170> making<00:00:37.739> sure<00:00:37.920> that<00:00:38.129> it<00:00:38.250> will<00:00:38.399> work<00:00:38.460> what

00:00:39.229 --> 00:00:39.239 
and making sure that it will work what

00:00:39.239 --> 00:00:41.380 
and making sure that it will work what
I'm<00:00:39.329> going<00:00:39.510> to<00:00:39.540> say<00:00:39.719> is<00:00:39.989> try<00:00:40.559> something<00:00:40.980> called

00:00:41.380 --> 00:00:41.390 
I'm going to say is try something called

00:00:41.390 --> 00:00:43.760 
I'm going to say is try something called
reCAPTCHA<00:00:42.390> reCAPTCHA<00:00:43.260> is<00:00:43.410> a<00:00:43.440> tool<00:00:43.739> that

00:00:43.760 --> 00:00:43.770 
reCAPTCHA reCAPTCHA is a tool that

00:00:43.770 --> 00:00:46.190 
reCAPTCHA reCAPTCHA is a tool that
utilizes<00:00:44.550> the<00:00:44.820> human<00:00:45.180> eye<00:00:45.270> rather<00:00:45.660> than<00:00:45.930> just

utilizes the human eye rather than just

00:00:51.319 --> 00:00:51.329 
typography in a recapture tool that we

00:00:51.329 --> 00:00:54.080 
typography in a recapture tool that we
have<00:00:51.510> to<00:00:51.660> sort<00:00:51.870> of<00:00:51.930> look<00:00:52.649> really<00:00:53.520> deeply<00:00:53.910> in

00:00:54.080 --> 00:00:54.090 
have to sort of look really deeply in

00:00:54.090 --> 00:00:56.720 
have to sort of look really deeply in
and<00:00:54.320> pick<00:00:55.320> out<00:00:55.440> what<00:00:55.680> the<00:00:55.800> word<00:00:56.010> is<00:00:56.219> because

00:00:56.720 --> 00:00:56.730 
and pick out what the word is because

00:00:56.730 --> 00:00:58.610 
and pick out what the word is because
sometimes<00:00:57.210> letters<00:00:57.719> look<00:00:57.989> like<00:00:58.050> something

00:00:58.610 --> 00:00:58.620 
sometimes letters look like something

00:00:58.620 --> 00:01:01.220 
sometimes letters look like something
else<00:00:58.800> h's<00:00:59.399> can<00:00:59.640> look<00:00:59.760> like<00:00:59.879> an<00:01:00.090> Eleanor<00:01:00.719> and<00:01:01.140> we

00:01:01.220 --> 00:01:01.230 
else h's can look like an Eleanor and we

00:01:01.230 --> 00:01:02.720 
else h's can look like an Eleanor and we
don't<00:01:01.379> really<00:01:01.530> know<00:01:01.770> that<00:01:01.949> so<00:01:02.129> we<00:01:02.399> have<00:01:02.579> to

00:01:02.720 --> 00:01:02.730 
don't really know that so we have to

00:01:02.730 --> 00:01:04.490 
don't really know that so we have to
sort<00:01:03.090> of<00:01:03.210> stop<00:01:03.480> for<00:01:03.719> a<00:01:03.750> minute<00:01:03.930> and<00:01:04.080> type<00:01:04.320> it

00:01:04.490 --> 00:01:04.500 
sort of stop for a minute and type it

00:01:04.500 --> 00:01:05.929 
sort of stop for a minute and type it
out<00:01:04.589> that's<00:01:04.860> how<00:01:05.040> we<00:01:05.100> can<00:01:05.369> prove<00:01:05.580> that<00:01:05.760> we<00:01:05.909> are

00:01:05.929 --> 00:01:05.939 
out that's how we can prove that we are

00:01:05.939 --> 00:01:07.969 
out that's how we can prove that we are
human<00:01:06.420> rather<00:01:06.659> than<00:01:06.930> just<00:01:07.140> a<00:01:07.260> coded<00:01:07.619> system

00:01:07.969 --> 00:01:07.979 
human rather than just a coded system

human rather than just a coded system
that<00:01:08.430> being<00:01:08.729> said<00:01:09.030> it's<00:01:09.330> something<00:01:09.720> that

00:01:09.859 --> 00:01:09.869 
that being said it's something that

00:01:09.869 --> 00:01:12.170 
that being said it's something that
would<00:01:10.140> annoy<00:01:10.470> players<00:01:10.830> but<00:01:11.220> not<00:01:11.700> that<00:01:11.909> much

00:01:12.170 --> 00:01:12.180 
would annoy players but not that much

00:01:12.180 --> 00:01:14.660 
would annoy players but not that much
small<00:01:12.869> price<00:01:13.110> to<00:01:13.350> pay<00:01:13.380> to<00:01:13.710> slow<00:01:13.979> down<00:01:14.130> box<00:01:14.430> a

small price to pay to slow down box a

00:01:14.670 --> 00:01:16.880 
small price to pay to slow down box a
lot<00:01:14.970> now<00:01:15.240> instead<00:01:15.780> of<00:01:15.869> just<00:01:16.110> utilizing<00:01:16.500> it<00:01:16.770> as

00:01:16.880 --> 00:01:16.890 
lot now instead of just utilizing it as

00:01:16.890 --> 00:01:19.100 
lot now instead of just utilizing it as
a<00:01:16.950> sign<00:01:17.280> up<00:01:17.490> tool<00:01:17.729> which<00:01:17.970> most<00:01:18.210> websites<00:01:18.420> do<00:01:18.869> it

00:01:19.100 --> 00:01:19.110 
a sign up tool which most websites do it

00:01:19.110 --> 00:01:21.080 
a sign up tool which most websites do it
should<00:01:19.380> be<00:01:19.500> utilized<00:01:19.920> as<00:01:20.130> a<00:01:20.159> sign<00:01:20.460> up<00:01:20.640> tool<00:01:20.820> and

00:01:21.080 --> 00:01:21.090 
should be utilized as a sign up tool and

00:01:21.090 --> 00:01:22.760 
should be utilized as a sign up tool and
something<00:01:21.780> that<00:01:21.900> we<00:01:21.990> have<00:01:22.080> to<00:01:22.200> do<00:01:22.320> every<00:01:22.619> time

00:01:22.760 --> 00:01:22.770 
something that we have to do every time

00:01:22.770 --> 00:01:25.820 
something that we have to do every time
we<00:01:22.920> log<00:01:23.130> in<00:01:23.369> this<00:01:23.549> would<00:01:24.000> remove<00:01:24.659> a<00:01:24.930> huge<00:01:25.470> chunk

00:01:25.820 --> 00:01:25.830 
we log in this would remove a huge chunk

00:01:25.830 --> 00:01:28.039 
we log in this would remove a huge chunk
of<00:01:25.979> gold<00:01:26.220> selling<00:01:26.460> websites<00:01:26.670> the<00:01:27.630> only<00:01:27.840> issue

00:01:28.039 --> 00:01:28.049 
of gold selling websites the only issue

00:01:28.049 --> 00:01:29.960 
of gold selling websites the only issue
is<00:01:28.200> it<00:01:28.470> wouldn't<00:01:28.799> really<00:01:28.890> remove<00:01:29.369> player<00:01:29.729> on

00:01:29.960 --> 00:01:29.970 
is it wouldn't really remove player on

00:01:29.970 --> 00:01:31.850 
is it wouldn't really remove player on
box<00:01:30.240> because<00:01:30.689> any<00:01:30.930> player<00:01:31.290> could<00:01:31.500> just<00:01:31.680> type
