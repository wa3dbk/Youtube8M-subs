synchronization<00:03:36.000> will<00:03:36.270> begin<00:03:36.600> so<00:03:37.200> now<00:03:37.530> what's

00:03:37.880 --> 00:03:37.890 
synchronization will begin so now what's

00:03:37.890 --> 00:03:40.190 
synchronization will begin so now what's
happening<00:03:38.310> is<00:03:38.490> we're<00:03:38.730> synchronizing<00:03:39.510> all<00:03:39.750> our

00:03:40.190 --> 00:03:40.200 
happening is we're synchronizing all our

00:03:43.640 --> 00:03:43.650 
outlook data to our USB key so we can

00:03:43.650 --> 00:03:45.730 
outlook data to our USB key so we can
transfer<00:03:44.160> that<00:03:44.190> to<00:03:44.940> another<00:03:45.300> computer

00:03:45.730 --> 00:03:45.740 
transfer that to another computer

00:03:45.740 --> 00:03:57.230 
transfer that to another computer
afterwards<00:03:55.010> okay<00:03:56.010> now<00:03:56.280> that<00:03:56.310> that's<00:03:56.520> opened

00:03:57.230 --> 00:03:57.240 
afterwards okay now that that's opened

00:03:57.240 --> 00:04:00.350 
afterwards okay now that that's opened
up<00:03:57.420> we're<00:03:57.960> actually<00:03:58.170> going<00:03:58.530> to<00:03:58.770> close<00:03:59.250> it<00:03:59.520> to

00:04:00.350 --> 00:04:00.360 
up we're actually going to close it to

00:04:00.360 --> 00:04:02.150 
up we're actually going to close it to
simulate<00:04:00.960> if<00:04:01.200> you<00:04:01.350> are<00:04:01.470> moving<00:04:01.680> to<00:04:01.950> another

00:04:02.150 --> 00:04:02.160 
simulate if you are moving to another

00:04:02.160 --> 00:04:04.580 
simulate if you are moving to another
computer<00:04:02.490> so<00:04:03.360> if<00:04:03.600> you<00:04:03.750> did<00:04:03.930> want<00:04:04.050> to<00:04:04.170> transfer

00:04:04.580 --> 00:04:04.590 
computer so if you did want to transfer

00:04:04.590 --> 00:04:06.770 
computer so if you did want to transfer
it<00:04:04.680> to<00:04:04.710> another<00:04:04.830> computer<00:04:05.280> you<00:04:05.730> would<00:04:05.850> take

00:04:06.770 --> 00:04:06.780 
it to another computer you would take

00:04:06.780 --> 00:04:09.650 
it to another computer you would take
your<00:04:06.990> USB<00:04:07.500> device<00:04:07.950> out<00:04:08.190> and<00:04:09.150> go<00:04:09.390> to<00:04:09.450> the

00:04:09.650 --> 00:04:09.660 
your USB device out and go to the

00:04:09.660 --> 00:04:12.290 
your USB device out and go to the
computer<00:04:09.840> connect<00:04:10.740> your<00:04:10.890> USB<00:04:11.030> device<00:04:12.030> and
