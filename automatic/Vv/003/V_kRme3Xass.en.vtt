00:02:39.869 --> 00:02:39.879 
to spine crawlers but as you guys can

00:02:39.879 --> 00:02:41.159 
to spine crawlers but as you guys can
see<00:02:39.939> man<00:02:40.209> then<00:02:40.389> I'm<00:02:40.480> going<00:02:40.659> to<00:02:40.719> finish<00:02:40.900> this<00:02:41.049> a

see man then I'm going to finish this a

00:02:41.169 --> 00:02:43.140 
see man then I'm going to finish this a
bunch<00:02:41.409> of<00:02:41.500> things<00:02:41.859> coming<00:02:42.159> out<00:02:42.310> the<00:02:42.760> repair

00:02:43.140 --> 00:02:43.150 
bunch of things coming out the repair

00:02:43.150 --> 00:02:46.559 
bunch of things coming out the repair
picks<00:02:43.659> up<00:02:43.870> one<00:02:44.409> of<00:02:44.620> them<00:02:44.799> and<00:02:45.239> yeah<00:02:46.239> I<00:02:46.450> don't

picks up one of them and yeah I don't
think<00:02:46.840> at<00:02:46.959> this<00:02:47.079> point<00:02:47.200> maka<00:02:47.680> check<00:02:48.579> Prime<00:02:48.879> has

00:02:49.530 --> 00:02:49.540 
think at this point maka check Prime has

00:02:49.540 --> 00:02:51.689 
think at this point maka check Prime has
to<00:02:49.810> rethink<00:02:50.379> his<00:02:50.469> strategy<00:02:50.650> but<00:02:51.069> as<00:02:51.280> you<00:02:51.549> can

00:02:51.689 --> 00:02:51.699 
to rethink his strategy but as you can

00:02:51.699 --> 00:02:53.849 
to rethink his strategy but as you can
see<00:02:51.849> here<00:02:52.030> man<00:02:52.209> the<00:02:52.540> Reaper<00:02:52.840> pops<00:02:53.109> out<00:02:53.319> doing<00:02:53.799> a

00:02:53.849 --> 00:02:53.859 
see here man the Reaper pops out doing a

00:02:53.859 --> 00:02:55.319 
see here man the Reaper pops out doing a
little<00:02:54.010> bit<00:02:54.159> of<00:02:54.189> her<00:02:54.340> ass<00:02:54.519> I<00:02:54.760> do<00:02:54.969> believe<00:02:55.209> that

00:02:55.319 --> 00:02:55.329 
little bit of her ass I do believe that

00:02:55.329 --> 00:02:57.179 
little bit of her ass I do believe that
its<00:02:55.510> primary<00:02:55.750> target<00:02:56.290> so<00:02:56.469> far<00:02:56.680> is<00:02:56.829> the<00:02:56.980> spine

00:02:57.179 --> 00:02:57.189 
its primary target so far is the spine

00:02:57.189 --> 00:02:58.979 
its primary target so far is the spine
crawler<00:02:57.459> then<00:02:58.060> most<00:02:58.329> likely<00:02:58.510> due<00:02:58.840> to<00:02:58.870> the

00:02:58.979 --> 00:02:58.989 
crawler then most likely due to the

00:02:58.989 --> 00:03:01.259 
crawler then most likely due to the
positioning<00:02:59.590> of<00:02:59.739> this<00:02:59.949> bunker<00:03:00.400> it<00:03:00.790> will<00:03:01.090> be

00:03:01.259 --> 00:03:01.269 
positioning of this bunker it will be

00:03:01.269 --> 00:03:03.149 
positioning of this bunker it will be
the<00:03:01.359> spawning<00:03:01.659> pool<00:03:01.989> and<00:03:02.199> man<00:03:02.590> oh<00:03:02.620> man<00:03:02.769> if<00:03:03.069> this

00:03:03.149 --> 00:03:03.159 
the spawning pool and man oh man if this

00:03:03.159 --> 00:03:05.640 
the spawning pool and man oh man if this
finding<00:03:03.519> pool<00:03:03.669> goes<00:03:03.879> down<00:03:04.090> check<00:03:05.019> prime<00:03:05.319> will

00:03:05.640 --> 00:03:05.650 
finding pool goes down check prime will

00:03:05.650 --> 00:03:07.110 
finding pool goes down check prime will
be<00:03:05.680> in<00:03:05.829> a<00:03:05.889> lot<00:03:06.069> of<00:03:06.099> trouble<00:03:06.519> now<00:03:06.819> he<00:03:06.879> has<00:03:07.090> the

00:03:07.110 --> 00:03:07.120 
be in a lot of trouble now he has the

00:03:07.120 --> 00:03:09.720 
be in a lot of trouble now he has the
first<00:03:07.569> screen<00:03:07.780> popped<00:03:08.409> out<00:03:08.650> and<00:03:08.859> one<00:03:09.489> of<00:03:09.609> his

00:03:09.720 --> 00:03:09.730 
first screen popped out and one of his

00:03:09.730 --> 00:03:12.420 
first screen popped out and one of his
spine<00:03:09.939> crawlers<00:03:10.359> has<00:03:10.750> gone<00:03:11.079> up<00:03:11.260> and<00:03:11.439> I<00:03:12.310> do

spine crawlers has gone up and I do

00:03:12.430 --> 00:03:13.679 
spine crawlers has gone up and I do
believe<00:03:12.699> mad<00:03:12.909> at<00:03:13.000> this<00:03:13.150> point<00:03:13.359> that<00:03:13.419> he<00:03:13.599> is

just trying to buy time to build more

00:03:15.459 --> 00:03:17.909 
just trying to buy time to build more

units to build more siblings to counter

00:03:17.919 --> 00:03:19.319 
units to build more siblings to counter
this<00:03:18.040> attack<00:03:18.370> and<00:03:18.549> maybe<00:03:18.699> try<00:03:18.909> to<00:03:18.939> take<00:03:19.150> out

see what kind of unit or building it is
going<00:04:53.920> to<00:04:54.070> morph<00:04:54.310> into<00:04:54.400> and<00:04:55.860> yeah<00:04:56.860> so<00:04:57.160> far<00:04:57.370> we

00:04:57.810 --> 00:04:57.820 
going to morph into and yeah so far we

00:04:57.820 --> 00:04:59.520 
going to morph into and yeah so far we
have<00:04:57.850> ensnared<00:04:58.390> you<00:04:58.600> get<00:04:58.780> out<00:04:58.870> of<00:04:58.990> the<00:04:59.110> Reaper

queens now and as you guys see boom

00:05:08.290 --> 00:05:11.460 
queens now and as you guys see boom
right<00:05:08.560> there<00:05:08.880> they<00:05:09.880> can<00:05:09.940> transfuse<00:05:10.630> and<00:05:10.900> heal

00:05:11.460 --> 00:05:11.470 
right there they can transfuse and heal

00:05:11.470 --> 00:05:13.830 
right there they can transfuse and heal
each<00:05:11.620> other<00:05:11.860> but<00:05:12.100> mmm<00:05:12.970> look<00:05:13.210> at<00:05:13.330> the<00:05:13.420> strategy

00:05:13.830 --> 00:05:13.840 
each other but mmm look at the strategy

00:05:13.840 --> 00:05:16.230 
each other but mmm look at the strategy

right here my spine crawler ensnare
space<00:05:16.570> so<00:05:17.140> he<00:05:17.380> is<00:05:17.470> going<00:05:17.620> to<00:05:17.740> be<00:05:17.860> in<00:05:17.920> a<00:05:17.980> lot<00:05:18.130> of

00:05:18.150 --> 00:05:18.160 
space so he is going to be in a lot of

00:05:18.160 --> 00:05:21.150 
space so he is going to be in a lot of
trouble<00:05:18.580> if<00:05:18.760> he<00:05:19.660> doesn't<00:05:20.290> you<00:05:20.590> know<00:05:20.620> make<00:05:21.040> you

00:05:21.150 --> 00:05:21.160 
trouble if he doesn't you know make you

00:05:21.160 --> 00:05:22.950 
trouble if he doesn't you know make you
push<00:05:21.370> forward<00:05:21.400> right<00:05:21.850> here<00:05:22.030> because<00:05:22.210> if<00:05:22.780> you

push forward right here because if you
look<00:05:23.080> at<00:05:23.260> his<00:05:23.350> baseline<00:05:23.560> it<00:05:23.890> is<00:05:24.010> quite

00:05:24.270 --> 00:05:24.280 
look at his baseline it is quite

00:05:24.280 --> 00:05:26.460 
look at his baseline it is quite
undefended<00:05:25.000> and<00:05:25.180> well<00:05:25.900> he<00:05:26.050> does<00:05:26.200> have<00:05:26.230> a

00:05:29.010 --> 00:05:29.020 
factory up and the tech lab so he may

00:05:29.020 --> 00:05:30.630 
factory up and the tech lab so he may
get<00:05:29.200> siege<00:05:29.470> tanks<00:05:29.770> to<00:05:29.890> help<00:05:30.070> himself<00:05:30.250> down<00:05:30.580> the
