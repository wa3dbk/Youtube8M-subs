 remember with gotaga diablo and broken 

00:00:40.290 --> 00:00:44.550
 so you've qualified through 

00:00:42.750 --> 00:00:45.780

00:00:45.780 --> 00:00:49.290

 you are going today so participate 

00:00:49.290 --> 00:00:53.760
 in the group stages of these championships 

00:00:52.110 --> 00:00:55.949
 of the world that would allow you to access 

00:00:53.760 --> 00:00:58.070
 at the final stages in a tree with 

00:00:55.949 --> 00:01:01.170
 up to a million dollars taken away 

00:00:58.070 --> 00:01:02.699
 how do you approach this hen and 

00:01:01.170 --> 00:01:07.770
 what do you think of the matches that 

00:01:02.699 --> 00:01:08.130
 you 're going to have played it's not really 

00:01:07.770 --> 00:01:10.700
 in fact 

00:01:08.130 --> 00:01:13.260
 saw all the surprises like in tournament 

00:01:10.700 --> 00:01:16.770
 I see two South African teams 

00:01:13.260 --> 00:01:18.750
 who beats the Australian who beats actually 

00:01:16.770 --> 00:01:21.090
 he's high I mean that in our 

00:01:18.750 --> 00:01:23.100
 hen my viewfinder of a team to himself 

00:01:21.090 --> 00:01:25.020
 beware the team of Brazil 

00:01:23.100 --> 00:01:28.369
 we know that they do not give in externally 

00:01:25.020 --> 00:01:31.140
 this is one of the games was going more I see the 

00:01:28.369 --> 00:01:31.740
 huawei the most titled European and not 

00:01:31.140 --> 00:01:36.149
 European 

00:01:31.740 --> 00:01:38.810
 the top-20 European people one day I 

00:01:36.149 --> 00:01:42.040
 do not know at all the rays 

00:01:38.810 --> 00:01:44.470
 that bayat on her american eyes 

00:01:42.040 --> 00:01:47.590
 it does not know what it's going to give 

00:01:44.470 --> 00:01:48.910
 really more I can not predict what 

00:01:47.590 --> 00:01:49.640
 will happen in this group there we hope 

00:01:48.910 --> 00:01:52.220
 in tale 

00:01:49.640 --> 00:01:53.510
 we start facing the Brazilian in three 

00:01:52.220 --> 00:01:56.330
 four o'clock in three o'clock I believe 

00:01:53.510 --> 00:01:59.860
 in the daily fight already 3-0 that we 

00:01:56.330 --> 00:02:02.540
 put it well after play iceman snow 

00:01:59.860 --> 00:02:03.320
 we will have done the taff already we are very 

00:02:02.540 --> 00:02:04.520
 well actually it's with this is 

00:02:03.320 --> 00:02:06.650
 not a fascine easier to negotiate 

00:02:04.520 --> 00:02:08.090
 you are a little bit in the dark of 

00:02:06.650 --> 00:02:09.619
 fact that you will fall only against 

00:02:08.090 --> 00:02:11.390
 teams that you do not know is 

00:02:09.619 --> 00:02:12.320
 what for you it's an advantage because 

00:02:11.390 --> 00:02:13.610
 that precisely he does not know you 

00:02:12.320 --> 00:02:15.200
 they will not be counted 

00:02:13.610 --> 00:02:16.459
 or is it really a 

00:02:15.200 --> 00:02:19.069
 disadvantage because you do not know of 

00:02:16.459 --> 00:02:20.300
 gauge them all and it's during a 

00:02:19.069 --> 00:02:23.480
 disadvantage because the bulls we 

00:02:20.300 --> 00:02:24.709
 know I think they do not 

00:02:23.480 --> 00:02:26.480
 do not know I did a bit of 

00:02:24.709 --> 00:02:29.000
 time the rails he was on the stream 

00:02:26.480 --> 00:02:30.410
 we saw the sound of the stream have copied 

00:02:29.000 --> 00:02:32.480
 apart from that what we do in this crime is 

00:02:30.410 --> 00:02:33.800
 not very beautiful to see so do not care a 

00:02:32.480 --> 00:02:35.000
 little of that but we really do not know 

00:02:33.800 --> 00:02:36.290
 of the daub game is that he knows that 

00:02:35.000 --> 00:02:37.910
 it is he knows God there is us 

00:02:36.290 --> 00:02:38.720
 look too but I stay close they 

00:02:37.910 --> 00:02:41.000
 know me well enough 

00:02:38.720 --> 00:02:42.320
 we do not really know zero ramp 

00:02:41.000 --> 00:02:44.540
 so if any game we know anything about their 

00:02:42.320 --> 00:02:45.800
 players a song by four benefits 

00:02:44.540 --> 00:02:47.720
 after parents I take the example of 

00:02:45.800 --> 00:02:49.880
 references that sometimes have a 

00:02:47.720 --> 00:02:52.489
 advantage to play this goal it remains a big 

00:02:49.880 --> 00:02:56.269
 match after cross by vs nva the ps2 

00:02:52.489 --> 00:02:57.230
 Rise genre was preferred at least one 

00:02:56.269 --> 00:02:59.750
 knows the game recipe we know 

00:02:57.230 --> 00:03:01.070
 how they play so invite the soul to 

00:02:59.750 --> 00:03:02.030
 a disadvantage because they 

00:03:01.070 --> 00:03:04.670
 know and we do not know them all 

00:03:02.030 --> 00:03:07.070
 very well so as you said it's going 

00:03:04.670 --> 00:03:07.579
 to be a hen that will not be easy to 

00:03:07.070 --> 00:03:09.890
 to negotiate 

00:03:07.579 --> 00:03:12.320
 nevertheless what is your goal in 

00:03:09.890 --> 00:03:13.730
 this tournament that she is really your 

00:03:12.320 --> 00:03:15.100
 ultimate goal is what are you 

00:03:13.730 --> 00:03:17.450
 make happy 

00:03:15.100 --> 00:03:19.310
 I can not set goals because 

00:03:17.450 --> 00:03:20.780
 that in view of the preparation we made 

00:03:19.310 --> 00:03:21.530
 anything we had problems 

00:03:20.780 --> 00:03:23.810
 internal 

00:03:21.530 --> 00:03:26.090
 as you all know at the level of 

00:03:23.810 --> 00:03:27.680
 serious scream me not known 

00:03:26.090 --> 00:03:28.940
 really what we're worth we've lost all 

00:03:27.680 --> 00:03:30.260
 we are struggling to win a best-of have 

00:03:28.940 --> 00:03:32.210
 reuters soon they won 

00:03:30.260 --> 00:03:35.600
 four of eleven of course 

00:03:32.210 --> 00:03:36.620
 so I do not know what we're going to see we're 

00:03:35.600 --> 00:03:37.940
 always better in lan when this crime 

00:03:36.620 --> 00:03:40.970
 there is a big difference in level 

00:03:37.940 --> 00:03:45.590
 but precisely to aim top 3 I 

00:03:40.970 --> 00:03:47.630
 prepared better so for me the goal 

00:03:45.590 --> 00:03:48.920
 it's in the currency what month after I 

00:03:47.630 --> 00:03:49.280
 goes to millenium and malacca top 5 

00:03:48.920 --> 00:03:50.510
 world 

00:03:49.280 --> 00:03:52.910
 I would like to stay in the 

00:03:50.510 --> 00:03:54.890
 sense well curved very well then by 

00:03:52.910 --> 00:03:55.940
 report precisely to this preparation you 

00:03:54.890 --> 00:03:56.990
 talk about it and we talk about it a little bit 

00:03:55.940 --> 00:03:58.670
 with the other teams in the waters 

00:03:56.990 --> 00:03:59.660
 interviews it's true that people 

00:03:58.670 --> 00:04:00.950
 who makes them a bit of the day and the 

00:03:59.660 --> 00:04:02.750
 night you are capable of the best like 

00:04:00.950 --> 00:04:04.760
 the worst as we saw last year 

00:04:02.750 --> 00:04:06.020
 is today that she is 

00:04:04.760 --> 00:04:07.460
 what are you missing that is what 

00:04:06.020 --> 00:04:10.010
 could trigger the best in you 

00:04:07.460 --> 00:04:13.070
 in this in this event no it's 

00:04:10.010 --> 00:04:14.300
 moments there it would be fair to 

00:04:13.070 --> 00:04:16.700
 leave confident therefore not to beat the 

00:04:14.300 --> 00:04:18.320
 brazilians 3 0 and I think we can 

00:04:16.700 --> 00:04:21.910
 to be very strong and very solid if we 

00:04:18.320 --> 00:04:24.110
 win all our matches without fail at 100 

00:04:21.910 --> 00:04:25.280
 no big individual action really 

00:04:24.110 --> 00:04:26.960
 as a team that we are all alone 

00:04:25.280 --> 00:04:30.020
 and there I think we could really 

00:04:26.960 --> 00:04:32.630
 to go very very far even to do very 

00:04:30.020 --> 00:04:34.460
 afraid or colossus b it really depends that 

00:04:32.630 --> 00:04:35.080
 of us actually these limits do not see 

00:04:34.460 --> 00:04:36.860
 the adversary 

00:04:35.080 --> 00:04:39.950
 after I know that I spoke a lot and 

00:04:36.860 --> 00:04:41.360
 that samir and i gotta I know he thinks 

00:04:39.950 --> 00:04:42.890
 a lot to a little what's called the 

00:04:41.360 --> 00:04:44.860
 last c1 does not go first 

00:04:42.890 --> 00:04:46.840
 tower 

00:04:44.860 --> 00:04:49.389
 I told them that it was just 

00:04:46.840 --> 00:04:51.129
 It's nice to play 

00:04:49.389 --> 00:04:54.840
 we may be ashamed of ourselves 

00:04:51.129 --> 00:04:54.840
 we do not go well we'll be ready for what 

00:04:55.469 --> 00:05:00.520
 very well then compared to all that 

00:04:58.659 --> 00:05:02.439
 so apart from all of you this 

00:05:00.520 --> 00:05:04.180
 event I'm going to ask you were 

00:05:02.439 --> 00:05:05.349
 the predictions for the top 3 is 

00:05:04.180 --> 00:05:06.639
 also a note on the vital ones 

00:05:05.349 --> 00:05:07.060
 and irritating wanted to be played a lot 

00:05:06.639 --> 00:05:08.620
 this week 

00:05:07.060 --> 00:05:12.729
 you think they are capable of what 

00:05:08.620 --> 00:05:14.080
 here thierry tons his cake with the 

00:05:12.729 --> 00:05:15.870
 change of deluxe with tony jaa 

00:05:14.080 --> 00:05:18.550
 it gave them a new game site 

00:05:15.870 --> 00:05:20.830
 much more aggressive to the American 

00:05:18.550 --> 00:05:24.310
 thanks to get some at the level of his is in 

00:05:20.830 --> 00:05:25.900
 game after fo I hope that agony this 

00:05:24.310 --> 00:05:27.039
 is not too much the question because we 

00:05:25.900 --> 00:05:30.389
 know that goni can make big 

00:05:27.039 --> 00:05:34.719
 big game or very bad says m 

00:05:30.389 --> 00:05:37.449
 so for me I really think it 

00:05:34.719 --> 00:05:39.699
 can do a big trick and in the 

00:05:37.449 --> 00:05:42.909
 currency it would be very good for 

00:05:39.699 --> 00:05:44.919
 them even more after that depends on whether 

00:05:42.909 --> 00:05:46.779
 bracket those who have crossed collie 

00:05:44.919 --> 00:05:49.300
 sbéahs navy have a lot of trouble in 

00:05:46.779 --> 00:05:51.129
 move on but why did not they beat 

00:05:49.300 --> 00:05:53.589
 3-1 valves against es b he could have 

00:05:51.129 --> 00:05:55.500
 earn miss weight worry-free they have 

00:05:53.589 --> 00:05:57.159
 makes a lot of mistakes 

00:05:55.500 --> 00:05:59.770
 I hope for them that they are really going 

00:05:57.159 --> 00:06:01.779
 to let go and play like as off 

00:05:59.770 --> 00:06:05.740
 establish the guigne increase and above 3 

00:06:01.779 --> 00:06:07.960
 e of the top 3 I'm fine al 

00:06:05.740 --> 00:06:10.509
 in already a name first of our mistakes 

00:06:07.960 --> 00:06:13.409
 I do not know anything about school in sb I see 

00:06:10.509 --> 00:06:18.159
 not in I see optical in it 

00:06:13.409 --> 00:06:21.419
 and tcm also i want goals and his hands 

00:06:18.159 --> 00:06:21.419
 no I collected cm 

00:06:22.770 --> 00:06:30.460
 not any case I do not see in the 

00:06:25.810 --> 00:06:32.550
 all away glue optical case after that 

00:06:30.460 --> 00:06:33.660
 south team like us 

00:06:32.550 --> 00:06:35.460
 I think Americans do not have 

00:06:33.660 --> 00:06:38.250
 makes a death worse as the last 

00:06:35.460 --> 00:06:39.510
 the top 5 already very good good bah plays 

00:06:38.250 --> 00:06:41.370
 I say again we will wish you good 

00:06:39.510 --> 00:06:43.050
 luck for your first match against 

00:06:41.370 --> 00:06:44.100
 the brazilians just now 

00:06:43.050 --> 00:06:46.620
 hoping that this is going well for 

00:06:44.100 --> 00:06:48.000
 you in this tournament anyway I 

00:06:46.620 --> 00:06:50.010
 think all the people who will watch 

00:06:48.000 --> 00:06:51.690
 this video support you a maximum 

00:06:50.010 --> 00:06:54.000
 and see you very soon maybe 

00:06:51.690 --> 00:06:55.650
 for future interviews and to you 

00:06:54.000 --> 00:06:56.700
 we'll be back very soon to 

00:06:55.650 --> 00:06:59.270

00:06:56.700 --> 00:06:59.270
 during the whole weekend
