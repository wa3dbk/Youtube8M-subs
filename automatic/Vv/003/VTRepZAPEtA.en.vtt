six or nades I think he picks them up
after<00:01:01.920> he's<00:01:02.219> fanned<00:01:02.460> them<00:01:02.699> because<00:01:03.090> in<00:01:03.239> this

00:01:03.349 --> 00:01:03.359 
after he's fanned them because in this

00:01:03.359 --> 00:01:05.240 
after he's fanned them because in this

00:01:05.240 --> 00:01:05.250 
game when you throw your grenades you

00:01:05.250 --> 00:01:06.920 
game when you throw your grenades you
can<00:01:05.400> run<00:01:05.729> over<00:01:05.760> a<00:01:05.970> dead<00:01:06.210> body<00:01:06.240> and<00:01:06.600> pick<00:01:06.780> some

00:01:06.920 --> 00:01:06.930 
can run over a dead body and pick some

00:01:06.930 --> 00:01:09.440 
can run over a dead body and pick some
more<00:01:07.080> up<00:01:07.140> just<00:01:08.040> kind<00:01:08.130> of<00:01:08.250> weird<00:01:08.460> but<00:01:08.670> I<00:01:08.970> guess

00:01:34.490 --> 00:01:34.500 
in my opinion this game is pretty equal

00:01:34.500 --> 00:01:37.609 
in my opinion this game is pretty equal
to<00:01:34.710> a<00:01:34.740> color<00:01:35.070> before<00:01:35.430> and<00:01:35.909> how<00:01:36.540> awesome<00:01:37.409> it<00:01:37.530> is

00:01:37.609 --> 00:01:37.619 
to a color before and how awesome it is

00:01:37.619 --> 00:01:40.370 
to a color before and how awesome it is
because<00:01:38.430> single<00:01:39.240> player<00:01:39.450> in<00:01:39.720> this<00:01:39.869> game<00:01:39.990> is

because single player in this game is
definitely<00:01:41.340> in<00:01:41.670> my<00:01:41.899> opinion<00:01:42.899> the<00:01:43.560> most<00:01:43.590> epic

00:01:44.149 --> 00:01:44.159 
definitely in my opinion the most epic

00:01:44.159 --> 00:01:46.850 
definitely in my opinion the most epic
single<00:01:44.820> player<00:01:45.000> of<00:01:45.270> any<00:01:45.689> call<00:01:46.079> of<00:01:46.200> duty<00:01:46.470> just

00:04:03.180 --> 00:04:03.190 
really have a good computer so I

00:04:03.190 --> 00:04:04.830 
really have a good computer so I
couldn't<00:04:03.489> use<00:04:03.640> the<00:04:04.030> best<00:04:04.239> graphics<00:04:04.720> I'd

00:04:04.830 --> 00:04:04.840 
couldn't use the best graphics I'd

00:04:04.840 --> 00:04:06.600 
couldn't use the best graphics I'd
everything<00:04:05.170> like<00:04:05.470> I'm<00:04:05.590> the<00:04:05.620> lower<00:04:05.980> standards

00:04:06.600 --> 00:04:06.610 
everything like I'm the lower standards

00:04:06.610 --> 00:04:08.370 
everything like I'm the lower standards
but<00:04:06.850> I<00:04:06.910> still<00:04:07.180> had<00:04:07.390> a<00:04:07.420> great<00:04:07.690> time<00:04:07.840> playing<00:04:08.050> it

00:04:08.370 --> 00:04:08.380 
but I still had a great time playing it

00:04:08.380 --> 00:04:10.650 
but I still had a great time playing it
the<00:04:08.410> single<00:04:08.920> player<00:04:09.010> is<00:04:09.250> fun<00:04:09.489> I<00:04:09.850> didn't<00:04:10.570> really

00:04:10.650 --> 00:04:10.660 
the single player is fun I didn't really

00:04:10.660 --> 00:04:12.330

get<00:04:10.840> to<00:04:10.989> do<00:04:11.110> multiplayer<00:04:11.500> that<00:04:11.890> much<00:04:12.100> because

00:04:12.330 --> 00:04:12.340 
get to do multiplayer that much because

00:04:12.340 --> 00:04:14.340 
get to do multiplayer that much because
I<00:04:12.880> guess<00:04:13.120> something<00:04:13.690> was<00:04:13.840> wrong<00:04:14.050> in<00:04:14.230> my

00:04:14.340 --> 00:04:14.350

00:04:14.350 --> 00:04:16.229 
I guess something was wrong in my
computer<00:04:14.770> like<00:04:14.950> I<00:04:15.070> said<00:04:15.280> it<00:04:15.489> wasn't<00:04:15.850> the<00:04:16.060> best

00:04:16.229 --> 00:04:16.239 
computer like I said it wasn't the best

00:04:16.239 --> 00:04:18.210 
computer like I said it wasn't the best
computer<00:04:16.720> but<00:04:17.049> I<00:04:17.350> did<00:04:17.650> get<00:04:17.770> some<00:04:17.919> multiplayer

00:04:18.210 --> 00:04:18.220
