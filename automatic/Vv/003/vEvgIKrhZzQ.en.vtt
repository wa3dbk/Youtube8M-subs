00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.310
 yo way it is five hours for nose 

00:00:02.520 --> 00:00:06.960
 just today we are going back to school 

00:00:05.310 --> 00:00:08.490
 tnt games at the walls for whole 

00:00:06.960 --> 00:00:10.469
 curious trying things 

00:00:08.490 --> 00:00:12.120
 was it women we played 

00:00:10.469 --> 00:00:14.610
 was nice way and guarantors of 

00:00:12.120 --> 00:00:15.960
 fun and kind of heavy all three 

00:00:14.610 --> 00:00:18.210
 pretty good their so maybe 

00:00:15.960 --> 00:00:20.460
 recruiting soon but going for now 

00:00:18.210 --> 00:00:22.289
 we were playing as cool game and the 

00:00:20.460 --> 00:00:27.720
 top twice actually shares in speed 

00:00:22.289 --> 00:00:29.039
 and so we go to point b, but we remember 

00:00:27.720 --> 00:00:29.970
 not everyone should i am just an elder 

00:00:29.039 --> 00:00:33.090
 so bad look left 

00:00:29.970 --> 00:00:39.180
 ah and callers 

00:00:33.090 --> 00:00:40.649
 server they give because I found the previous one 

00:00:39.180 --> 00:00:43.890
 times or in the mail preferably wild then 

00:00:40.649 --> 00:00:48.420
 that big man played and 

00:00:43.890 --> 00:00:49.920
 and I thought what less was just like 

00:00:48.420 --> 00:00:52.920
 you went down early to me than 

00:00:49.920 --> 00:00:54.809
 you really see the sjaak or you don't 

00:00:52.920 --> 00:00:56.570
 you do with your ass book and that nobody 

00:00:54.809 --> 00:00:59.579
 by where you were so that wasn't real 

00:00:56.570 --> 00:01:02.219
 not really fair I think 

00:00:59.579 --> 00:01:04.080
 everyone has it so it is possible 

00:01:02.219 --> 00:01:06.000
 yes this is just nice flat folder so 

00:01:04.080 --> 00:01:07.500
 I go down just a nice weather and 

00:01:06.000 --> 00:01:10.619
 will be fine 

00:01:07.500 --> 00:01:13.950
 I think just as Doria 

00:01:10.619 --> 00:01:15.450
 why do you follow me i had it us 

00:01:13.950 --> 00:01:16.590
 also read i just read the convention 

00:01:15.450 --> 00:01:18.570
 you must have questions like you 

00:01:16.590 --> 00:01:21.119
 or something like that should be the normal one 

00:01:18.570 --> 00:01:25.290
 good questions then i can just answer 

00:01:21.119 --> 00:01:29.180
 respond to take heed of all be so 

00:01:25.290 --> 00:01:29.180
 someone died the first one died 

00:01:29.490 --> 00:01:35.400
 but hope you said you totally 

00:01:32.909 --> 00:01:36.570
 no looked at your head can do 

00:01:35.400 --> 00:01:38.700
 I never actually have anyone 

00:01:36.570 --> 00:01:40.290
 seen with a cake so that in itself 

00:01:38.700 --> 00:01:42.869
 percent taste 

00:01:40.290 --> 00:01:45.030
 scratches it apparently a corpse viewer 

00:01:42.869 --> 00:01:47.009
 folder 

00:01:45.030 --> 00:01:48.720
 that went well i rinse through that 

00:01:47.009 --> 00:01:49.560
 you don't have to miss this pastor 

00:01:48.720 --> 00:01:51.750
 to intimidate 

00:01:49.560 --> 00:01:53.280
 from far right and then there are three more 

00:01:51.750 --> 00:01:53.970

00:01:53.280 --> 00:01:56.130

 I don't know if this is different on this 

00:03:14.079 --> 00:03:21.239
 but the team is clear 

00:03:18.760 --> 00:03:21.239
 the same 

00:03:21.519 --> 00:03:29.470
 yes with that was and tnt run 

00:03:26.799 --> 00:03:30.160
 I was actually treated about we were 

00:03:29.470 --> 00:03:31.930
 talking 

00:03:30.160 --> 00:03:33.860
 until I'm in a pack down 

00:03:31.930 --> 00:03:36.110
 a lot of 

00:03:33.860 --> 00:03:39.320
 and actually nothing in me anymore 

00:03:36.110 --> 00:03:41.450
 in the van before the falls quite counts now 

00:03:39.320 --> 00:03:42.980
 very dramatic marrakech 

00:03:41.450 --> 00:03:46.340
 tanks for invite no problem 

00:03:42.980 --> 00:03:50.300
 So he stayed here for fun 

00:03:46.340 --> 00:03:51.380
 the sport ii case but that's wrong 

00:03:50.300 --> 00:03:53.380
 I haven't had this for a while 

00:03:51.380 --> 00:03:55.460
 done 10 type think for sure did 

00:03:53.380 --> 00:03:58.490
 what for me recently 

00:03:55.460 --> 00:04:02.110
 when i do it every night every 

00:03:58.490 --> 00:04:02.110
 evening is perhaps a bit exaggerated 

00:04:02.959 --> 00:04:08.330
 so also very much the first floor 

00:04:04.160 --> 00:04:11.450
 in freestyle you won with 

00:04:08.330 --> 00:04:14.239
 cool regulations we go here of course 

00:04:11.450 --> 00:04:16.070
 also just with the gig look on it 

00:04:14.239 --> 00:04:19.510
 still a little can 

00:04:16.070 --> 00:04:21.350
 spring spring spring wanted double jump 

00:04:19.510 --> 00:04:24.350
 half jump 

00:04:21.350 --> 00:04:32.240
 she's heart jumped straight left 

00:04:24.350 --> 00:04:34.400
 am there I have to watch out for others 

00:04:32.240 --> 00:04:36.470
 people but this is something like you 

00:04:34.400 --> 00:04:38.330
 then you also have to pay attention 

00:04:36.470 --> 00:04:41.030
 girls so I do not focus 

00:04:38.330 --> 00:04:43.510
 taste normal play I had it whole 

00:04:41.030 --> 00:04:43.510
 passive 

00:04:44.060 --> 00:04:48.169
 since i just chill find him 

00:04:45.200 --> 00:04:50.200
 not to run too fast and she had to 

00:04:48.169 --> 00:04:52.790
 I was really correct correct so yes 

00:04:50.200 --> 00:04:56.270
 but yes if you play with people 

00:04:52.790 --> 00:04:58.460
 really really want to win as just 

00:04:56.270 --> 00:04:59.830
 then it is a bit more difficult to do that 

00:04:58.460 --> 00:05:02.240
 very cut off 

00:04:59.830 --> 00:05:04.580
 she goes for you and everyone is up to it 

00:05:02.240 --> 00:05:08.510
 run and I think it's quite that chill 

00:05:04.580 --> 00:05:09.380
 just have to walk from walk why wider 

00:05:08.510 --> 00:05:11.680
 back 

00:05:09.380 --> 00:05:15.310
 you easily with the blocks earlier 

00:05:11.680 --> 00:05:15.310
 but it does not matter 

00:05:15.410 --> 00:05:20.720
 pumpkin 

00:05:17.450 --> 00:05:24.920
 so hope i saw them under my feet 

00:05:20.720 --> 00:05:27.110
 disappear but they still remained oh it 

00:05:24.920 --> 00:05:32.500
 he becomes a bit empty it becomes he 

00:05:27.110 --> 00:05:35.900
 a bit empty and fits 2 and we god 

00:05:32.500 --> 00:05:38.450
 all went wrong it was quite the 

00:05:35.900 --> 00:05:39.890
 samples two people 

00:05:38.450 --> 00:05:41.240
 you have to look at how little then none 

00:05:39.890 --> 00:05:43.750
 soon will really click I tell you 

00:05:41.240 --> 00:05:45.290
 soon a lot of the will go 

00:05:43.750 --> 00:05:51.590
 real one 

00:05:45.290 --> 00:05:56.300
 cooper rappers oh that was number 21 child 

00:05:51.590 --> 00:05:58.610
 so I want super little about me 

00:05:56.300 --> 00:05:59.960
 don't know how everyone pretends to be 

00:05:58.610 --> 00:06:01.730
 really be better at once 

00:05:59.960 --> 00:06:03.200
 become 

00:06:01.730 --> 00:06:07.460
 or maybe a radiologist becomes a spurt 

00:06:03.200 --> 00:06:11.000
 now against the real women I still have 

00:06:07.460 --> 00:06:12.350
 over a cable to my God I 

00:06:11.000 --> 00:06:16.400

00:06:16.400 --> 00:06:21.080

00:06:37.430 --> 00:06:41.090
 you just can't make jumps 

00:06:39.050 --> 00:06:45.500
