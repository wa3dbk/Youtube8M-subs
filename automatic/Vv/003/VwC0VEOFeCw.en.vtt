thought that the Bonneville Speedway to

00:00:14.760 --> 00:00:17.240 
thought that the Bonneville Speedway to
see<00:00:14.940> if<00:00:15.000> it<00:00:15.180> could<00:00:15.360> break<00:00:15.570> a<00:00:15.630> few<00:00:15.870> records<00:00:16.379> the

in<00:00:19.560> August<00:00:19.860> 2015<00:00:20.340> with<00:00:20.520> him<00:00:20.820> back<00:00:21.060> to<00:00:21.240> the<00:00:21.330> solo

00:00:21.560 --> 00:00:21.570 
in August 2015 with him back to the solo

00:00:21.570 --> 00:00:23.840 
in August 2015 with him back to the solo
with<00:00:21.810> more<00:00:21.990> power<00:00:22.260> tall<00:00:22.830> the<00:00:22.980> gears<00:00:23.220> and<00:00:23.490> more

00:00:23.840 --> 00:00:23.850

00:00:27.260 --> 00:00:27.270 
very here in the lead-up Speedway we

00:00:27.270 --> 00:00:28.670 
very here in the lead-up Speedway we
thought<00:00:27.480> we'd<00:00:27.600> make<00:00:27.630> a<00:00:27.810> few<00:00:28.110> short<00:00:28.350> videos<00:00:28.650> to

00:00:28.670 --> 00:00:28.680 
thought we'd make a few short videos to

00:00:28.680 --> 00:00:30.170 
thought we'd make a few short videos to
answer<00:00:29.160> some<00:00:29.340> of<00:00:29.369> the<00:00:29.490> questions<00:00:29.520> we've<00:00:30.150> been

00:00:30.170 --> 00:00:30.180 
answer some of the questions we've been

00:01:27.980 --> 00:01:27.990 
horsepower of methanol so this time on

00:01:27.990 --> 00:01:29.870 
horsepower of methanol so this time on
methanol<00:01:28.409> if<00:01:28.560> we<00:01:28.709> can<00:01:28.889> do<00:01:29.009> tun<00:01:29.310> puppy<00:01:29.700> could

00:01:29.870 --> 00:01:29.880 
methanol if we can do tun puppy could

00:01:29.880 --> 00:01:34.459 
methanol if we can do tun puppy could
knock<00:01:30.179> on<00:01:30.389> the<00:01:30.630> 350<00:01:31.259> horse<00:01:33.079> which<00:01:34.079> is<00:01:34.109> quite<00:01:34.439> a

00:01:34.459 --> 00:01:34.469 
knock on the 350 horse which is quite a

00:01:34.469 --> 00:01:37.069 
knock on the 350 horse which is quite a
bit<00:01:34.679> for<00:01:34.770> a<00:01:34.859> thousand<00:01:35.219> season<00:01:35.520> inside<00:01:36.079> well

00:01:37.069 --> 00:01:37.079 
bit for a thousand season inside well

00:01:37.079 --> 00:01:39.949 
bit for a thousand season inside well
the<00:01:37.139> calling<00:01:37.380> system<00:01:37.649> we<00:01:37.799> run<00:01:37.950> a<00:01:38.810> sexy<00:01:39.810> liter

00:01:39.949 --> 00:01:39.959 
the calling system we run a sexy liter

00:01:39.959 --> 00:01:41.419 
the calling system we run a sexy liter
water<00:01:40.079> tank<00:01:40.409> inside<00:01:40.770> the<00:01:40.889> cockpit<00:01:41.069> of<00:01:41.310> the<00:01:41.369> car

00:01:41.419 --> 00:01:41.429 
water tank inside the cockpit of the car

00:01:41.429 --> 00:01:43.669 
water tank inside the cockpit of the car
so<00:01:41.939> all<00:01:42.119> the<00:01:42.359> water<00:01:43.169> from<00:01:43.439> the<00:01:43.560> engine

00:01:43.669 --> 00:01:43.679 
so all the water from the engine

00:01:43.679 --> 00:01:45.499 
so all the water from the engine
circulates<00:01:44.340> through<00:01:44.579> that<00:01:44.789> via<00:01:45.060> electric

00:01:45.499 --> 00:01:45.509 
circulates through that via electric

00:01:45.509 --> 00:01:48.019 
circulates through that via electric
pump<00:01:45.749> so<00:01:46.529> we<00:01:46.649> don't<00:01:46.799> run<00:01:46.979> the<00:01:47.249> original<00:01:47.609> water

00:01:48.019 --> 00:01:48.029 
pump so we don't run the original water

00:01:48.029 --> 00:01:51.469 
pump so we don't run the original water
pump<00:01:48.329> at<00:01:48.450> all<00:01:48.569> now<00:01:49.849> we<00:01:50.849> are<00:01:50.939> now<00:01:51.060> going<00:01:51.240> to<00:01:51.299> also

00:01:51.469 --> 00:01:51.479 
pump at all now we are now going to also

00:01:51.479 --> 00:01:54.139 
pump at all now we are now going to also
run<00:01:51.869> the<00:01:52.020> oil<00:01:52.200> pipes<00:01:52.889> into<00:01:53.279> that<00:01:53.579> tank<00:01:53.880> and

00:01:54.139 --> 00:01:54.149 
run the oil pipes into that tank and

00:01:54.149 --> 00:01:55.639 
run the oil pipes into that tank and
call<00:01:54.359> them<00:01:54.599> as<00:01:54.779> well<00:01:54.959> because<00:01:55.409> the<00:01:55.499> oil

00:01:55.639 --> 00:01:55.649 
call them as well because the oil

00:01:55.649 --> 00:01:56.959 
call them as well because the oil
temperature<00:01:55.889> was<00:01:56.249> going<00:01:56.459> through<00:01:56.639> the<00:01:56.759> roof

00:01:56.959 --> 00:01:56.969 
temperature was going through the roof

00:01:56.969 --> 00:02:00.260 
temperature was going through the roof
last<00:01:57.270> time<00:01:58.429> changed<00:01:59.429> to<00:01:59.579> the<00:01:59.639> gearbox<00:01:59.849> we<00:02:00.209> were

00:02:00.260 --> 00:02:00.270 
last time changed to the gearbox we were

00:02:00.270 --> 00:02:03.620 
last time changed to the gearbox we were
changing<00:02:00.989> from<00:02:01.020> the<00:02:01.590> 3.0<00:02:02.369> to<00:02:02.489> one<00:02:02.759> ratio<00:02:03.450> to

piece of kit the con rods from kad in
the<00:02:33.870> UK<00:02:34.250> and<00:02:35.250> we<00:02:35.459> have<00:02:35.639> lost<00:02:36.000> forged<00:02:36.359> pistons

00:02:36.530 --> 00:02:36.540 
the UK and we have lost forged pistons

00:02:36.540 --> 00:02:38.959 
the UK and we have lost forged pistons
and<00:02:37.230> then<00:02:37.349> of<00:02:37.500> course<00:02:37.530> the<00:02:37.920> 16-valve<00:02:38.579> beam

00:02:38.959 --> 00:02:38.969 
and then of course the 16-valve beam

00:02:38.969 --> 00:02:42.500 
and then of course the 16-valve beam
that<00:02:39.150> we<00:02:39.329> saw<00:02:39.510> on<00:02:39.569> d-don't<00:02:41.389> modifications<00:02:42.389> to

that we saw on d-don't modifications to

00:02:42.510 --> 00:02:44.179 
that we saw on d-don't modifications to
the<00:02:42.599> engine<00:02:42.659> this<00:02:42.959> time<00:02:43.170> we've<00:02:43.379> changed<00:02:44.040> the

00:02:44.179 --> 00:02:44.189 
the engine this time we've changed the

00:02:44.189 --> 00:02:45.530 
the engine this time we've changed the
compression<00:02:44.609> ratio<00:02:44.730> on<00:02:45.030> the<00:02:45.150> engine<00:02:45.359> we've

00:02:45.530 --> 00:02:45.540 
compression ratio on the engine we've

00:02:45.540 --> 00:02:47.059 
compression ratio on the engine we've
actually<00:02:45.689> increased<00:02:46.260> the<00:02:46.560> compression<00:02:46.769> ratio

00:02:47.059 --> 00:02:47.069 
actually increased the compression ratio

00:02:47.069 --> 00:02:49.940 
actually increased the compression ratio
on<00:02:47.430> one<00:02:47.579> engine<00:02:47.760> and<00:02:48.260> decreased<00:02:49.260> it<00:02:49.470> on<00:02:49.590> the

00:02:49.940 --> 00:02:49.950 
on one engine and decreased it on the

00:02:49.950 --> 00:02:54.349 
on one engine and decreased it on the
other<00:02:50.239> and<00:02:51.239> we've<00:02:52.049> had<00:02:52.290> some<00:02:53.359> different

00:02:54.349 --> 00:02:54.359 
other and we've had some different

00:02:54.359 --> 00:02:56.959 
other and we've had some different
specification<00:02:54.989> camshafts<00:02:55.560> made<00:02:55.769> for<00:02:56.040> it<00:02:56.129> for

00:02:56.959 --> 00:02:56.969 
specification camshafts made for it for

00:02:56.969 --> 00:02:59.209 
specification camshafts made for it for
both<00:02:57.269> engines<00:02:57.719> and<00:02:58.139> we<00:02:58.409> will<00:02:58.560> Dino<00:02:58.829> those

00:02:59.209 --> 00:02:59.219 
both engines and we will Dino those

00:02:59.219 --> 00:03:02.059 
both engines and we will Dino those
engines<00:02:59.790> and<00:03:00.120> then<00:03:00.750> finally<00:03:01.439> decide<00:03:01.739> on<00:03:01.769> what

00:03:02.059 --> 00:03:02.069 
engines and then finally decide on what

00:03:02.069 --> 00:03:04.869 
engines and then finally decide on what
camshaft<00:03:02.639> combination<00:03:03.209> we're<00:03:03.359> going<00:03:03.389> to<00:03:03.629> use

inch but we had to go to the 12 because

00:03:17.790 --> 00:03:20.869 
inch but we had to go to the 12 because
we<00:03:17.970> need<00:03:18.120> a<00:03:18.150> speed<00:03:18.479> rating<00:03:18.870> of<00:03:18.989> over<00:03:19.889> 150<00:03:20.699> mile

we need a speed rating of over 150 mile
an<00:03:20.909> hour<00:03:21.120> and<00:03:21.629> we<00:03:22.049> couldn't<00:03:22.290> get<00:03:22.470> anything<00:03:22.680> in

00:03:22.939 --> 00:03:22.949 
an hour and we couldn't get anything in

00:03:22.949 --> 00:03:25.939 
an hour and we couldn't get anything in
10<00:03:23.129> inch<00:03:23.340> so<00:03:24.329> the<00:03:24.840> tires<00:03:25.290> that<00:03:25.650> we're<00:03:25.769> using

00:03:25.939 --> 00:03:25.949 
10 inch so the tires that we're using

00:03:25.949 --> 00:03:28.099 
10 inch so the tires that we're using
these<00:03:26.669> Yokohama's<00:03:27.419> and<00:03:27.689> they're<00:03:27.870> being

00:03:28.099 --> 00:03:28.109 
these Yokohama's and they're being

00:03:28.109 --> 00:03:30.140 
these Yokohama's and they're being
having<00:03:28.829> all<00:03:28.979> the<00:03:29.099> tread<00:03:29.310> shaved<00:03:29.579> off<00:03:29.849> them<00:03:30.060> and

00:03:30.140 --> 00:03:30.150 
having all the tread shaved off them and

00:03:30.150 --> 00:03:31.849 
having all the tread shaved off them and
that'll<00:03:30.389> increase<00:03:30.629> our<00:03:30.900> speed<00:03:31.290> rating<00:03:31.709> to

00:03:31.849 --> 00:03:31.859 
that'll increase our speed rating to

00:03:31.859 --> 00:03:36.520 
that'll increase our speed rating to
probably<00:03:32.400> 170<00:03:33.209> hundred<00:03:33.479> and<00:03:33.569> 75<00:03:34.019> million<00:03:35.449> and
