don't<00:01:03.780> think<00:01:03.930> so<00:01:04.140> because<00:01:04.170> I'm<00:01:04.890> not<00:01:05.040> sure<00:01:05.280> how

00:01:05.450 --> 00:01:05.460 
don't think so because I'm not sure how

00:01:05.460 --> 00:01:08.149 
don't think so because I'm not sure how
to<00:01:05.519> implement<00:01:05.939> that<00:01:06.299> in<00:01:06.479> the<00:01:06.570> game<00:01:06.920> they<00:01:07.920> also

transports<00:01:10.320> and<00:01:10.530> what<00:01:10.979> this<00:01:11.100> means<00:01:11.369> is

00:01:11.630 --> 00:01:11.640 
transports and what this means is

00:01:11.640 --> 00:01:13.340 
transports and what this means is
vehicles<00:01:12.180> like<00:01:12.330> the<00:01:12.510> battlefield<00:01:12.960> 3<00:01:13.170> and

00:01:13.340 --> 00:01:13.350 
vehicles like the battlefield 3 and

00:01:13.350 --> 00:01:15.380 
vehicles like the battlefield 3 and
track<00:01:13.590> they've<00:01:14.400> already<00:01:14.640> introduced<00:01:15.240> the

armored trucks so I don't know what else
they<00:01:17.369> could<00:01:17.430> bring<00:01:17.610> to<00:01:17.759> the<00:01:17.880> table<00:01:18.090> they're
