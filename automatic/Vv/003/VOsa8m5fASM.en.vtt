00:00:02.060 --> 00:00:05.240 

okay<00:00:03.060> guys<00:00:03.210> so<00:00:03.449> this<00:00:03.480> is<00:00:03.840> trans<00:00:04.110> fats<00:00:04.529> and<00:00:04.830> this

00:00:05.240 --> 00:00:05.250 
okay guys so this is trans fats and this

00:00:05.250 --> 00:00:06.530 
okay guys so this is trans fats and this
is<00:00:05.370> why<00:00:05.520> they're<00:00:05.759> basically<00:00:06.089> well<00:00:06.359> actually

00:00:06.530 --> 00:00:06.540 
is why they're basically well actually

00:00:06.540 --> 00:00:08.960 
is why they're basically well actually
before<00:00:07.290> we<00:00:07.560> can<00:00:07.710> talk<00:00:07.919> about<00:00:08.130> that<00:00:08.280> you<00:00:08.790> have<00:00:08.940> a

00:00:08.960 --> 00:00:08.970 
before we can talk about that you have a

00:00:08.970 --> 00:00:11.540 
before we can talk about that you have a
little<00:00:09.360> bit<00:00:09.599> of<00:00:09.630> their<00:00:09.960> prep<00:00:10.260> work<00:00:10.530> on<00:00:10.800> stereo

00:00:11.540 --> 00:00:11.550 
little bit of their prep work on stereo

00:00:11.550 --> 00:00:13.160 
little bit of their prep work on stereo
isomers<00:00:12.030> because<00:00:12.300> they're<00:00:12.480> involved<00:00:12.780> in<00:00:13.080> the

00:00:13.160 --> 00:00:13.170 
isomers because they're involved in the

00:00:13.170 --> 00:00:15.620 
isomers because they're involved in the
discussion<00:00:13.679> so<00:00:14.400> up<00:00:14.670> here<00:00:14.730> I'm<00:00:15.059> drawing<00:00:15.389> my<00:00:15.570> two

00:00:15.620 --> 00:00:15.630 
discussion so up here I'm drawing my two

00:00:15.630 --> 00:00:18.260 
discussion so up here I'm drawing my two
different<00:00:16.289> stereoisomers<00:00:17.190> we've<00:00:17.730> got<00:00:17.940> a<00:00:17.970> lack

00:00:18.260 --> 00:00:18.270 
different stereoisomers we've got a lack

00:00:18.270 --> 00:00:20.210 
different stereoisomers we've got a lack
of<00:00:18.300> rotation<00:00:18.630> around<00:00:19.410> my<00:00:19.619> carbon<00:00:20.100> to<00:00:20.189> carbon

00:00:20.210 --> 00:00:20.220 
of rotation around my carbon to carbon

00:00:20.220 --> 00:00:23.000 
of rotation around my carbon to carbon
double<00:00:20.880> bond<00:00:21.090> and<00:00:21.390> two<00:00:22.109> different<00:00:22.260> groups<00:00:22.619> on

00:00:23.000 --> 00:00:23.010 
double bond and two different groups on

00:00:23.010 --> 00:00:25.009 
double bond and two different groups on
each<00:00:23.340> carbon<00:00:23.699> so<00:00:24.240> these<00:00:24.390> are<00:00:24.449> stereoisomers

00:00:25.009 --> 00:00:25.019 
each carbon so these are stereoisomers

00:00:25.019 --> 00:00:27.439 
each carbon so these are stereoisomers
and<00:00:25.980> what<00:00:26.130> we've<00:00:26.250> got<00:00:26.400> is<00:00:26.550> our<00:00:26.670> sis<00:00:26.970> onset

00:00:27.439 --> 00:00:27.449 
and what we've got is our sis onset

00:00:27.449 --> 00:00:29.810 
and what we've got is our sis onset
isomer<00:00:27.930> we're<00:00:28.349> both<00:00:28.590> free<00:00:28.769> our<00:00:28.949> groups<00:00:29.250> point

00:00:29.810 --> 00:00:29.820 
isomer we're both free our groups point

00:00:29.820 --> 00:00:32.540 
isomer we're both free our groups point
in<00:00:29.939> the<00:00:30.029> same<00:00:30.210> direction<00:00:30.269> and<00:00:30.990> that<00:00:31.130> trans<00:00:32.130> or

00:00:32.540 --> 00:00:32.550

e isomer where they point in opposite
directions<00:00:35.510> if<00:00:36.510> you've<00:00:36.809> got<00:00:36.989> a<00:00:37.020> bit<00:00:37.230> of

00:00:37.310 --> 00:00:37.320 
directions if you've got a bit of

trouble<00:00:37.500> remembering<00:00:38.460> how<00:00:38.670> they<00:00:38.820> pair<00:00:39.120> up<00:00:39.149> I

00:00:39.590 --> 00:00:39.600 
trouble remembering how they pair up I

00:00:39.600 --> 00:00:42.770 
trouble remembering how they pair up I
always<00:00:40.200> think<00:00:40.620> Eddie's<00:00:41.370> are<00:00:41.700> the<00:00:42.030> comedian<00:00:42.570> is

00:00:42.770 --> 00:00:42.780 
always think Eddie's are the comedian is

00:00:42.780 --> 00:00:45.619 
always think Eddie's are the comedian is
a<00:00:42.840> transvestite<00:00:43.620> so<00:00:44.610> that<00:00:44.789> helps<00:00:45.300> it<00:00:45.390> keep<00:00:45.420> in

00:00:45.619 --> 00:00:45.629 
a transvestite so that helps it keep in

trial this looks like that and obviously
you're<00:01:10.710> gonna<00:01:10.830> have<00:01:13.520> and<00:01:14.520> what<00:01:14.700> that<00:01:14.850> does<00:01:15.060> is

00:01:15.320 --> 00:01:15.330 
you're gonna have and what that does is

00:01:15.330 --> 00:01:18.050 
you're gonna have and what that does is
it<00:01:15.479> reacts<00:01:15.840> with<00:01:16.020> 3<00:01:16.500> fatty<00:01:16.950> acids<00:01:17.520> which<00:01:17.939> are

it reacts with 3 fatty acids which are

00:01:18.060 --> 00:01:20.570 
it reacts with 3 fatty acids which are
basically<00:01:18.380> carboxylic<00:01:19.380> acids<00:01:19.920> with<00:01:20.280> a<00:01:20.340> very

long chain of cardinals coming over so

00:01:23.220 --> 00:01:25.130 
long chain of cardinals coming over so
it's<00:01:23.820> going<00:01:24.000> to<00:01:24.090> be<00:01:24.150> a<00:01:24.210> queen<00:01:24.509> again<00:01:24.630> estera

sort of mess up all my space my board
who<00:01:36.390> doesn't<00:01:36.659> look<00:01:36.720> too<00:01:36.869> confusing<00:01:37.380> I'm<00:01:37.770> going

00:01:38.149 --> 00:01:38.159 
who doesn't look too confusing I'm going

00:01:38.159 --> 00:01:40.460 
who doesn't look too confusing I'm going

into a warm carbon tail but in reality

00:01:40.470 --> 00:01:43.130 
into a warm carbon tail but in reality
all<00:01:41.130> three<00:01:41.880> of<00:01:41.909> these<00:01:42.150> would<00:01:42.570> have<00:01:42.720> carbon

00:01:43.130 --> 00:01:43.140 
all three of these would have carbon

00:01:43.140 --> 00:01:45.260 
all three of these would have carbon
tails<00:01:43.320> and<00:01:43.619> the<00:01:44.250> carbon<00:01:44.490> tails<00:01:44.880> can<00:01:45.180> be

00:01:45.260 --> 00:01:45.270 
tails and the carbon tails can be

00:01:45.270 --> 00:01:47.359 
tails and the carbon tails can be
exactly<00:01:45.689> the<00:01:45.840> same<00:01:45.869> in<00:01:46.649> which<00:01:46.799> case<00:01:47.009> we<00:01:47.159> call

00:01:47.359 --> 00:01:47.369 
exactly the same in which case we call

00:01:47.369 --> 00:01:50.480 
exactly the same in which case we call
it<00:01:47.520> a<00:01:47.549> simple<00:01:48.149> fact<00:01:48.509> or<00:01:48.869> it<00:01:49.350> can<00:01:49.500> be<00:01:49.530> different

00:01:50.480 --> 00:01:50.490 
it a simple fact or it can be different

00:01:50.490 --> 00:01:51.490 
it a simple fact or it can be different
to<00:01:50.670> each<00:01:50.820> other

00:01:51.490 --> 00:01:51.500 
to each other

00:01:51.500 --> 00:01:54.160 
to each other
which<00:01:51.590> case<00:01:51.830> it<00:01:52.010> called<00:01:52.280> a<00:01:52.430> natural<00:01:53.180> fat<00:01:53.480> of<00:01:53.840> a

00:01:54.160 --> 00:01:54.170 
which case it called a natural fat of a

00:01:54.170 --> 00:01:56.800 
which case it called a natural fat of a
natural<00:01:54.650> triglyceride<00:01:55.480> so<00:01:56.480> I'm<00:01:56.570> just<00:01:56.690> going

00:01:56.800 --> 00:01:56.810 
natural triglyceride so I'm just going

00:01:56.810 --> 00:01:59.110 
natural triglyceride so I'm just going
to<00:01:56.870> draw<00:01:56.990> a<00:01:57.020> top<00:01:57.320> on<00:01:57.560> and<00:01:57.860> let's<00:01:58.160> say<00:01:58.400> I'm<00:01:58.730> going

00:01:59.110 --> 00:01:59.120 
to draw a top on and let's say I'm going

00:01:59.120 --> 00:02:02.230 
to draw a top on and let's say I'm going
to<00:01:59.270> control<00:01:59.540> this<00:01:59.660> like<00:01:59.840> this<00:02:00.760> let's<00:02:01.760> say<00:02:02.000> my

00:02:02.230 --> 00:02:02.240 
to control this like this let's say my

00:02:02.240 --> 00:02:09.850 
to control this like this let's say my
talk<00:02:02.479> one<00:02:05.290> has<00:02:06.290> a<00:02:07.209> trans<00:02:08.209> double<00:02:08.899> bond<00:02:09.289> it

00:02:09.850 --> 00:02:09.860 
talk one has a trans double bond it

00:02:09.860 --> 00:02:11.949 
talk one has a trans double bond it
would<00:02:10.160> look<00:02:10.280> like<00:02:10.429> this<00:02:10.640> so<00:02:11.180> I've<00:02:11.270> got<00:02:11.480> one

00:02:11.949 --> 00:02:11.959 
would look like this so I've got one

00:02:11.959 --> 00:02:14.560 
would look like this so I've got one
bond<00:02:12.290> go<00:02:12.500> one<00:02:12.800> way<00:02:13.010> and<00:02:13.280> the<00:02:13.730> other<00:02:13.760> going<00:02:14.390> the

00:02:14.560 --> 00:02:14.570 
bond go one way and the other going the

00:02:14.570 --> 00:02:17.230 
bond go one way and the other going the
other<00:02:14.630> way<00:02:14.780> so<00:02:15.350> my<00:02:15.590> trans<00:02:16.010> bond<00:02:16.459> when<00:02:17.030> I<00:02:17.060> have<00:02:17.209> a

00:02:17.230 --> 00:02:17.240 
other way so my trans bond when I have a

00:02:17.240 --> 00:02:19.600 
other way so my trans bond when I have a
trans<00:02:17.660> fat<00:02:18.050> that's<00:02:18.650> what's<00:02:18.890> called<00:02:19.040> transfer

00:02:19.600 --> 00:02:19.610 
trans fat that's what's called transfer

00:02:19.610 --> 00:02:21.280 
trans fat that's what's called transfer
because<00:02:20.120> your<00:02:20.420> double<00:02:20.690> bonds<00:02:20.900> are<00:02:21.110> in<00:02:21.200> the

00:02:21.280 --> 00:02:21.290 
because your double bonds are in the

00:02:21.290 --> 00:02:24.190 
because your double bonds are in the
trans<00:02:21.700> orientation<00:02:22.700> tends<00:02:23.510> to<00:02:23.750> be<00:02:23.930> in

00:02:24.190 --> 00:02:24.200 
trans orientation tends to be in

00:02:24.200 --> 00:02:26.890 
trans orientation tends to be in
straight<00:02:24.830> lines<00:02:25.150> now<00:02:26.150> what<00:02:26.420> this<00:02:26.540> means

00:02:26.890 --> 00:02:26.900 
straight lines now what this means

00:02:26.900 --> 00:02:29.170 
straight lines now what this means
because<00:02:27.380> it's<00:02:27.560> in<00:02:27.680> straight<00:02:27.980> lines<00:02:28.010> is<00:02:28.730> quite

00:02:29.170 --> 00:02:29.180 
because it's in straight lines is quite

00:02:29.180 --> 00:02:32.080 
because it's in straight lines is quite
a<00:02:29.209> flat<00:02:29.720> molecule<00:02:30.320> so<00:02:31.160> because<00:02:31.489> it's<00:02:31.640> a<00:02:31.730> flat

00:02:32.080 --> 00:02:32.090 
a flat molecule so because it's a flat

00:02:32.090 --> 00:02:34.690 
a flat molecule so because it's a flat
molecule<00:02:32.720> they<00:02:33.050> can<00:02:33.290> pack<00:02:33.620> together<00:02:33.890> very

00:02:34.690 --> 00:02:34.700 
molecule they can pack together very

00:02:34.700 --> 00:02:37.690 
molecule they can pack together very
closely<00:02:35.020> now<00:02:36.020> when<00:02:36.590> molecules<00:02:37.100> can<00:02:37.430> pack

00:02:37.690 --> 00:02:37.700 
closely now when molecules can pack

00:02:37.700 --> 00:02:40.390 
closely now when molecules can pack
closer<00:02:38.060> together<00:02:38.330> the<00:02:39.260> van<00:02:39.470> der<00:02:39.680> Waals<00:02:39.920> forces

00:02:40.390 --> 00:02:40.400 
closer together the van der Waals forces

00:02:40.400 --> 00:02:44.350 
closer together the van der Waals forces
between<00:02:40.670> them<00:02:41.209> stronger<00:02:42.220> so<00:02:43.220> these<00:02:43.790> trans

00:02:44.350 --> 00:02:44.360 
between them stronger so these trans

00:02:44.360 --> 00:02:46.630 
between them stronger so these trans
fats<00:02:44.750> have<00:02:45.170> very<00:02:45.500> strong<00:02:45.950> van<00:02:46.280> der<00:02:46.459> Waals

00:02:46.630 --> 00:02:46.640 
fats have very strong van der Waals

00:02:46.640 --> 00:02:49.120 
fats have very strong van der Waals
forces<00:02:47.090> and<00:02:47.480> this<00:02:48.170> as<00:02:48.470> i'm<00:02:48.590> sure<00:02:48.620> you<00:02:49.010> remember

00:02:49.120 --> 00:02:49.130 
forces and this as i'm sure you remember

00:02:49.130 --> 00:02:52.449 
forces and this as i'm sure you remember
from<00:02:49.640> last<00:02:49.850> year<00:02:50.209> will<00:02:50.750> increase<00:02:51.590> the<00:02:52.070> melting

00:02:52.449 --> 00:02:52.459 
from last year will increase the melting

00:02:52.459 --> 00:02:55.390 
from last year will increase the melting
point<00:02:52.670> so<00:02:53.360> these<00:02:53.510> tend<00:02:53.930> to<00:02:54.110> stay<00:02:54.440> as<00:02:54.590> solid<00:02:54.890> and

00:02:55.390 --> 00:02:55.400 
point so these tend to stay as solid and

00:02:55.400 --> 00:02:58.060 
point so these tend to stay as solid and
very<00:02:55.459> easily<00:02:56.360> they<00:02:56.870> tend<00:02:57.110> to<00:02:57.140> solidify<00:02:57.500> very

00:02:58.060 --> 00:02:58.070 
very easily they tend to solidify very

00:02:58.070 --> 00:03:11.190 
very easily they tend to solidify very
easily<00:02:58.540> now<00:02:59.540> let's<00:02:59.810> have<00:02:59.900> a<00:02:59.959> look<00:03:00.170> our<00:03:01.239> sister

00:03:11.190 --> 00:03:11.200 

00:03:11.200 --> 00:03:14.800 

so<00:03:12.200> I've<00:03:12.620> got<00:03:12.830> both<00:03:13.160> my<00:03:13.550> bonds<00:03:14.150> doing<00:03:14.660> in<00:03:14.720> the

00:03:14.800 --> 00:03:14.810 
so I've got both my bonds doing in the

00:03:14.810 --> 00:03:17.680 
so I've got both my bonds doing in the
same<00:03:15.050> direction<00:03:15.260> and<00:03:15.890> because<00:03:16.849> of<00:03:16.879> this<00:03:17.239> you

00:03:17.680 --> 00:03:17.690 
same direction and because of this you

00:03:17.690 --> 00:03:20.110 
same direction and because of this you
get<00:03:17.840> car<00:03:18.110> like<00:03:18.260> a<00:03:18.290> kink<00:03:18.709> in<00:03:18.860> the<00:03:18.980> molecule<00:03:19.250> so

00:03:20.110 --> 00:03:20.120 
get car like a kink in the molecule so

00:03:20.120 --> 00:03:22.240 
get car like a kink in the molecule so
now<00:03:20.300> rather<00:03:20.750> than<00:03:20.959> able<00:03:21.290> to<00:03:21.379> pack<00:03:21.650> very<00:03:21.950> close

00:03:22.240 --> 00:03:22.250 
now rather than able to pack very close

00:03:22.250 --> 00:03:24.790 
now rather than able to pack very close
together<00:03:22.629> because<00:03:23.629> I<00:03:23.750> molecule<00:03:24.200> has<00:03:24.379> a<00:03:24.440> kink

00:03:24.790 --> 00:03:24.800 
together because I molecule has a kink

00:03:24.800 --> 00:03:27.210 
together because I molecule has a kink
in<00:03:24.980> it<00:03:25.160> they<00:03:25.580> can't<00:03:25.970> pack<00:03:26.269> very<00:03:26.450> close<00:03:26.780> at<00:03:27.050> all

00:03:27.210 --> 00:03:27.220 
in it they can't pack very close at all

00:03:27.220 --> 00:03:30.580 
in it they can't pack very close at all
so<00:03:28.220> the<00:03:28.700> van<00:03:28.940> der<00:03:29.090> Waals<00:03:29.269> forces<00:03:29.780> or<00:03:30.170> a<00:03:30.410> lot

00:03:30.580 --> 00:03:30.590 
so the van der Waals forces or a lot

00:03:30.590 --> 00:03:33.940 
so the van der Waals forces or a lot
weaker<00:03:30.860> and<00:03:31.340> is<00:03:31.910> a<00:03:31.940> lot<00:03:32.269> easier<00:03:32.510> to<00:03:33.200> melt<00:03:33.680> it

00:03:33.940 --> 00:03:33.950 
weaker and is a lot easier to melt it

00:03:33.950 --> 00:03:36.160 
weaker and is a lot easier to melt it
into<00:03:34.190> a<00:03:34.519> liquid<00:03:34.760> it<00:03:35.420> will<00:03:35.540> have<00:03:35.750> a<00:03:35.780> lower

00:03:36.160 --> 00:03:36.170 
into a liquid it will have a lower

00:03:36.170 --> 00:03:39.280 
into a liquid it will have a lower
melting<00:03:36.799> point<00:03:37.090> now<00:03:38.090> in<00:03:38.239> my<00:03:38.360> flu<00:03:38.660> this<00:03:38.780> is<00:03:38.959> bad

00:03:39.280 --> 00:03:39.290 
melting point now in my flu this is bad

00:03:39.290 --> 00:03:41.860 
melting point now in my flu this is bad
in<00:03:39.620> fact<00:03:39.920> it's<00:03:40.190> quite<00:03:40.280> good<00:03:40.790> because<00:03:41.450> what<00:03:41.750> it

00:03:41.860 --> 00:03:41.870 
in fact it's quite good because what it

00:03:41.870 --> 00:03:45.670 
in fact it's quite good because what it
means<00:03:41.900> is<00:03:42.459> sis<00:03:43.459> fights<00:03:43.849> tend<00:03:44.750> to<00:03:45.019> stay<00:03:45.380> as

00:03:45.670 --> 00:03:45.680 
means is sis fights tend to stay as

00:03:45.680 --> 00:03:47.890 
means is sis fights tend to stay as
liquids<00:03:46.400> in<00:03:46.519> that<00:03:46.640> hood<00:03:46.880> so<00:03:47.420> you<00:03:47.510> can<00:03:47.660> travel

00:03:47.890 --> 00:03:47.900 
liquids in that hood so you can travel

00:03:47.900 --> 00:03:49.930 
liquids in that hood so you can travel
around<00:03:48.049> our<00:03:48.349> blood<00:03:48.590> and<00:03:48.769> probably<00:03:49.579> go<00:03:49.700> to<00:03:49.760> our

00:03:49.930 --> 00:03:49.940 
around our blood and probably go to our

00:03:49.940 --> 00:03:52.330 
around our blood and probably go to our
hips<00:03:50.120> are<00:03:50.299> us<00:03:50.569> of<00:03:50.840> a<00:03:51.079> low<00:03:51.560> in<00:03:51.620> my<00:03:51.799> case<00:03:52.040> as<00:03:52.220> I

00:03:52.330 --> 00:03:52.340 
hips are us of a low in my case as I

00:03:52.340 --> 00:03:56.920 
hips are us of a low in my case as I
don't<00:03:52.519> know<00:03:53.290> however<00:03:54.290> trans<00:03:55.069> fats<00:03:55.930> because

00:03:56.920 --> 00:03:56.930 
don't know however trans fats because

00:03:56.930 --> 00:04:00.309 
don't know however trans fats because
trans<00:03:57.590> fats<00:03:58.040> can<00:03:58.549> pack<00:03:58.849> together<00:03:59.090> and<00:03:59.630> have<00:04:00.110> a

00:04:00.309 --> 00:04:00.319 
trans fats can pack together and have a

00:04:00.319 --> 00:04:02.020 
trans fats can pack together and have a
very<00:04:00.380> much<00:04:00.799> higher<00:04:01.099> melting<00:04:01.430> point<00:04:01.670> because

00:04:02.020 --> 00:04:02.030 
very much higher melting point because

00:04:02.030 --> 00:04:03.550 
very much higher melting point because
there's<00:04:02.209> stronger<00:04:02.690> bounder<00:04:02.959> Waals<00:04:03.110> forces

00:04:03.550 --> 00:04:03.560 
there's stronger bounder Waals forces

00:04:03.560 --> 00:04:07.509 
there's stronger bounder Waals forces
they<00:04:04.220> solidify<00:04:04.970> a<00:04:05.209> lot<00:04:05.540> easier<00:04:05.860> so<00:04:06.860> if<00:04:07.190> i<00:04:07.489> have

00:04:07.509 --> 00:04:07.519 
they solidify a lot easier so if i have

00:04:07.519 --> 00:04:11.800 
they solidify a lot easier so if i have
an<00:04:07.849> artery<00:04:09.640> what's<00:04:10.640> going<00:04:10.880> to<00:04:10.910> happen<00:04:10.970> is<00:04:11.630> I'm

an artery what's going to happen is I'm
going<00:04:11.900> to<00:04:11.959> get<00:04:12.140> a<00:04:12.170> big<00:04:12.410> clump<00:04:12.799> of<00:04:13.540> trans<00:04:14.540> fats

00:04:18.279 --> 00:04:18.289 
stub block from my artery now imagine

00:04:18.289 --> 00:04:20.050 
stub block from my artery now imagine
your<00:04:18.590> hearts<00:04:18.919> trying<00:04:19.130> to<00:04:19.220> put<00:04:19.430> blood<00:04:19.760> through

completely block it and then what

00:04:40.490 --> 00:04:42.279 
completely block it and then what
happens<00:04:40.880> is<00:04:40.970> you<00:04:41.090> get<00:04:41.210> a<00:04:41.270> blood<00:04:41.510> part<00:04:41.810> you<00:04:42.110> get

00:04:42.279 --> 00:04:42.289 
happens is you get a blood part you get

00:04:42.289 --> 00:04:45.640 
happens is you get a blood part you get

a heart attack and you die heart disease

00:04:45.650 --> 00:04:49.450 
a heart attack and you die heart disease
is<00:04:45.860> the<00:04:45.950> biggest<00:04:46.729> killer<00:04:47.060> in<00:04:47.330> the<00:04:48.139> UK<00:04:48.500> even

00:04:49.450 --> 00:04:49.460 
is the biggest killer in the UK even

00:04:49.460 --> 00:04:52.180 
is the biggest killer in the UK even
more<00:04:49.580> cancers<00:04:49.970> the<00:04:50.120> biggest<00:04:50.450> killer<00:04:50.950> the<00:04:51.950> main

more cancers the biggest killer the main

00:04:52.190 --> 00:04:55.150 
more cancers the biggest killer the main
cause<00:04:52.520> of<00:04:52.550> heart<00:04:52.880> disease<00:04:53.270> is<00:04:53.539> this<00:04:53.990> so<00:04:54.770> this

00:04:55.150 --> 00:04:55.160 
cause of heart disease is this so this

00:04:55.160 --> 00:04:57.310 
cause of heart disease is this so this
is<00:04:55.400> what<00:04:55.849> kills<00:04:56.150> more<00:04:56.570> people<00:04:56.780> than<00:04:56.990> cancer

00:04:57.310 --> 00:04:57.320 
is what kills more people than cancer

00:04:57.320 --> 00:04:59.650 
is what kills more people than cancer

types<00:05:23.990> of<00:05:24.140> lipoproteins<00:05:24.770> we<00:05:25.220> have<00:05:25.430> of<00:05:25.670> high

00:05:25.930 --> 00:05:25.940

high-density<00:05:35.960> lipoproteins<00:05:36.860> are<00:05:37.070> the<00:05:37.400> good

00:05:37.600 --> 00:05:37.610 
high-density lipoproteins are the good

high-density lipoproteins are the good
lipoproteins<00:05:38.360> what<00:05:38.990> they<00:05:39.200> do<00:05:39.260> is<00:05:39.890> they<00:05:40.190> take

00:05:40.330 --> 00:05:40.340 
lipoproteins what they do is they take

00:05:40.340 --> 00:05:43.750 
lipoproteins what they do is they take
this<00:05:40.850> congealed<00:05:41.630> solidified<00:05:42.560> far<00:05:43.040> and<00:05:43.340> they

00:05:43.750 --> 00:05:43.760 
this congealed solidified far and they

00:05:43.760 --> 00:05:46.480 
this congealed solidified far and they
remove<00:05:44.180> it<00:05:44.480> and<00:05:44.630> stick<00:05:45.320> it<00:05:45.350> back<00:05:45.650> in<00:05:46.070> our<00:05:46.310> acts

00:05:46.480 --> 00:05:46.490 
remove it and stick it back in our acts

00:05:46.490 --> 00:05:49.750 
remove it and stick it back in our acts
are<00:05:46.670> our<00:05:46.760> hips<00:05:47.000> so<00:05:47.870> they're<00:05:48.080> good<00:05:48.760> low-density

00:05:49.750 --> 00:05:49.760 
are our hips so they're good low-density

00:05:49.760 --> 00:05:51.940 
are our hips so they're good low-density
lipoproteins<00:05:50.630> they're<00:05:50.870> the<00:05:50.960> bad<00:05:51.170> ones<00:05:51.470> what

00:05:51.940 --> 00:05:51.950 
lipoproteins they're the bad ones what

00:05:51.950 --> 00:05:54.100 
lipoproteins they're the bad ones what
they<00:05:52.160> do<00:05:52.220> is<00:05:52.880> they<00:05:53.000> take<00:05:53.030> it<00:05:53.360> from<00:05:53.480> our<00:05:53.660> hips

00:05:54.100 --> 00:05:54.110 
they do is they take it from our hips

00:05:54.110 --> 00:05:56.560 
they do is they take it from our hips
and<00:05:54.350> they<00:05:54.650> stick<00:05:54.920> it<00:05:55.040> back<00:05:55.220> in<00:05:55.280> our<00:05:55.580> blood<00:05:55.790> so

00:05:56.560 --> 00:05:56.570 
and they stick it back in our blood so

00:05:56.570 --> 00:05:58.960 
and they stick it back in our blood so
you've<00:05:56.690> got<00:05:56.720> to<00:05:57.050> always<00:05:57.350> warring<00:05:58.340> types<00:05:58.790> of

00:05:58.960 --> 00:05:58.970 
you've got to always warring types of

00:05:58.970 --> 00:06:00.580 
you've got to always warring types of
lipoproteins<00:05:59.600> they<00:05:59.750> work<00:05:59.960> against<00:06:00.440> each

00:06:00.580 --> 00:06:00.590 
lipoproteins they work against each

00:06:00.590 --> 00:06:03.790 
lipoproteins they work against each
other<00:06:01.060> what<00:06:02.060> trans<00:06:02.420> fats<00:06:02.810> do<00:06:03.110> is<00:06:03.410> they

00:06:03.790 --> 00:06:03.800 
other what trans fats do is they

00:06:03.800 --> 00:06:05.620 
other what trans fats do is they
increase<00:06:04.640> the<00:06:04.880> amount<00:06:05.120> of<00:06:05.150> low-density

00:06:05.620 --> 00:06:05.630 
increase the amount of low-density

00:06:05.630 --> 00:06:08.620 
increase the amount of low-density
lipoproteins<00:06:06.590> you<00:06:06.770> have<00:06:07.010> and<00:06:07.280> they<00:06:07.850> decrease

00:06:08.620 --> 00:06:08.630 
lipoproteins you have and they decrease

00:06:08.630 --> 00:06:10.600 
lipoproteins you have and they decrease
the<00:06:09.110> amount<00:06:09.200> of<00:06:09.380> high-density<00:06:09.830> lipoproteins

00:06:10.600 --> 00:06:10.610 
the amount of high-density lipoproteins

00:06:10.610 --> 00:06:13.870 
the amount of high-density lipoproteins
so<00:06:11.360> not<00:06:11.600> only<00:06:11.780> is<00:06:12.170> more<00:06:12.650> fat<00:06:12.950> getting<00:06:13.280> stuck<00:06:13.640> in

00:06:13.870 --> 00:06:13.880 
so not only is more fat getting stuck in

00:06:13.880 --> 00:06:15.970 
so not only is more fat getting stuck in
your<00:06:14.090> blood<00:06:14.330> so<00:06:14.540> with<00:06:14.720> a<00:06:14.750> fight<00:06:15.050> there<00:06:15.380> but

00:06:15.970 --> 00:06:15.980 
your blood so with a fight there but

00:06:15.980 --> 00:06:18.600 
your blood so with a fight there but
your<00:06:16.100> body<00:06:16.370> is<00:06:16.670> less<00:06:16.910> able<00:06:17.150> to<00:06:17.450> remove<00:06:17.720> it<00:06:18.050> and

00:06:18.600 --> 00:06:18.610 
your body is less able to remove it and

00:06:18.610 --> 00:06:21.490 
your body is less able to remove it and
more<00:06:19.610> is<00:06:19.730> getting<00:06:19.880> put<00:06:20.150> there<00:06:20.330> anyway<00:06:20.690> so

00:06:21.490 --> 00:06:21.500 
more is getting put there anyway so

00:06:21.500 --> 00:06:23.800 
more is getting put there anyway so
they've<00:06:21.980> got<00:06:22.010> is<00:06:22.190> twofold<00:06:22.670> effects<00:06:23.300> for<00:06:23.630> why

00:06:23.800 --> 00:06:23.810 
they've got is twofold effects for why

00:06:23.810 --> 00:06:26.140 
they've got is twofold effects for why
they<00:06:24.020> drop<00:06:24.320> and<00:06:24.350> mess<00:06:24.620> you<00:06:24.770> up<00:06:24.800> and<00:06:25.190> that<00:06:26.030> is

00:06:26.140 --> 00:06:26.150 
they drop and mess you up and that is

00:06:26.150 --> 00:06:32.380 
they drop and mess you up and that is
why<00:06:26.360> trans<00:06:26.780> fats<00:06:28.960> eat<00:06:29.960> salads
