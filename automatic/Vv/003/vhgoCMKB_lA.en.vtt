 almost there go out people in cloth does not come out 

00:00:15.599 --> 00:00:20.939
 It's because you do not have the same kind of 

00:00:17.699 --> 00:00:24.029
 ask then fabric paint does not come out 

00:00:20.939 --> 00:00:26.670

00:00:24.029 --> 00:00:32.489
 You prefer I'll wear this blue 

00:00:26.670 --> 00:00:35.130
 dark white light blue green and pink 

00:00:32.489 --> 00:00:39.410
 ok if you want you can use other 

00:00:35.130 --> 00:00:42.899

00:00:45.780 --> 00:00:51.390
 white to draw a shorts and a 

00:00:48.870 --> 00:00:53.760
 brush without that is also makeup 

00:00:51.390 --> 00:00:56.699
 but you can also use it to make the 

00:00:53.760 --> 00:01:03.359
 risks if you need a good film 

00:00:56.699 --> 00:01:06.299
 thin ruler to china the stacks and here 

00:01:03.359 --> 00:01:07.680
 are the golden lieutenants only to give a 

00:01:06.299 --> 00:01:09.720
 charm 

00:01:07.680 --> 00:01:11.850
 not that I show more or less the 

00:01:09.720 --> 00:01:15.810
 I thought I made a shock to you. 

00:01:11.850 --> 00:01:25.850
 have an idea so you do not need to 

00:01:15.810 --> 00:01:25.850
 rule nothing I did so following so 

00:01:32.360 --> 00:01:45.140
 So I did this and that for you. 

00:01:42.170 --> 00:01:47.710
 have a base and instead of being straight it is 

00:01:45.140 --> 00:01:47.710
 sO 

00:02:01.280 --> 00:02:04.110
 is a triangle then to follow that part 

00:02:03.409 --> 00:02:07.400
 to the party 

00:02:04.110 --> 00:02:07.400
 both below 

00:02:17.430 --> 00:02:23.549
 so he stayed like that, did not he? 

00:02:21.780 --> 00:02:27.959
 It's not only the mayor that's what I'm going to do 

00:02:23.549 --> 00:02:32.730
 do here I'll do it in a jump in the other 

00:02:27.959 --> 00:02:35.639
 I jump or in this picture here ok 

00:02:32.730 --> 00:02:37.859
 seeing here, I'm going to do it none at 

00:02:35.639 --> 00:02:41.420
 another does not and yes or no and those who do not 

00:02:37.859 --> 00:02:41.420
 go after I do this 

00:03:05.190 --> 00:03:10.739
 I painted some terminals paint pink 

00:03:27.800 --> 00:03:37.560
 also to be afraid to paint and went 

00:03:34.349 --> 00:03:40.500
 this way he stayed and I followed the 

00:03:37.560 --> 00:03:45.870
 things I had written on paper that 

00:03:40.500 --> 00:03:48.470
 was from this one it was dark blue because green 

00:03:45.870 --> 00:03:52.170
 Then white afterwards I paint. 

00:03:48.470 --> 00:03:54.290
 Then the second drawing is pink and blue 

00:03:52.170 --> 00:03:56.819
 light white and light green 

00:03:54.290 --> 00:03:58.829
 so there was things I yes but 

00:03:56.819 --> 00:04:01.650
 you can vary with other things that 

00:03:58.829 --> 00:04:04.980
 You better find out who's here. 

00:04:01.650 --> 00:04:08.519
 I bought these golden lines and ten 

00:04:04.980 --> 00:04:11.640
 silver then put follow or not this 

00:04:08.519 --> 00:04:14.160
 small in this hard but here the good in 

00:04:11.640 --> 00:04:15.930
 this line 

00:04:14.160 --> 00:04:19.350
 I put it here as you can. 

00:04:15.930 --> 00:04:25.260
 realize just one way he goes 

00:04:19.350 --> 00:04:27.510
 threading and going to soak the other like you 

00:04:25.260 --> 00:04:33.389
 close with the close scissors with finger 

00:04:27.510 --> 00:04:37.800
 Even if you read or with the scissors you 

00:04:33.389 --> 00:04:41.430
 Take the scissors down so I'm happy. 

00:04:37.800 --> 00:04:43.050
 are golden or even seeing it like this 

00:04:41.430 --> 00:04:50.340
 but he's three years old 

00:04:43.050 --> 00:04:51.450
 so I'll put several of them oc1 now 

00:04:50.340 --> 00:04:53.190
 I'll put more 

00:04:51.450 --> 00:04:58.320
 so he looks like this after having 

00:04:53.190 --> 00:05:01.370
 placed here in the pocket has 246 8 10 11 

00:04:58.320 --> 00:05:01.370
 In each side
