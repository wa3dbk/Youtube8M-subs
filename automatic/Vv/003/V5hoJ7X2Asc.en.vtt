00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.810
 the africans of the 1960s as the famous african safari track 

00:00:04.810 --> 00:00:08.249
 which takes place each year in English-speaking Africa from the list 

00:00:08.249 --> 00:00:11.569
 it was reputed to be the hardest rally in the world 

00:00:11.569 --> 00:00:15.559
 the cars had to stay strictly standard and this represented the test 

00:00:15.559 --> 00:00:19.409
 life size the most feared builders that peugeot will be the only one 

00:00:19.409 --> 00:00:22.409
 European manufacturer has won four times 

00:00:31.409 --> 00:00:34.350
 quality and a few more days today can produce some 

00:00:34.350 --> 00:00:35.330
 cars earlier 

00:00:35.330 --> 00:00:39.340
 it was certainly well-dressed at the time in 1164 in cash 

00:00:39.340 --> 00:00:42.100
 car that made a lot of kilometers with 

00:00:42.100 --> 00:00:44.950
 with them you did that he likes all the best known how the 

00:00:44.950 --> 00:00:46.470
 taxibot versions what is planned 

00:00:46.470 --> 00:00:49.640
 who were lying up to twelve thirteen fourteen people with engines 

00:00:49.640 --> 00:00:50.860
 robust gasoline 

00:00:50.860 --> 00:00:53.950
 I think it's the quality first it's car it's a car that's 

00:00:53.950 --> 00:00:56.460
 rather aesthetic but especially robust 

00:00:56.460 --> 00:01:01.180
 we can say that the 480 to awaken% of few Peugeot's sporting spirit 

00:01:01.180 --> 00:01:02.700
 practically players 

00:01:02.700 --> 00:01:06.090
 all attempts in motor racing won almost everywhere 

00:01:06.090 --> 00:01:08.760
 its comfort but the best place to disciplines we did not win until 

00:01:08.760 --> 00:01:09.890
 present 

00:01:09.890 --> 00:01:11.760
 but the 404 has been 

00:01:11.760 --> 00:01:15.000
 the first car registered in important international rallies 

00:01:15.680 --> 00:01:18.630
 and especially the best known on African rallies as small 

00:01:18.630 --> 00:01:20.020
 bandama devils 

00:01:20.020 --> 00:01:23.760
 for the time of 404 at the time the right state antunes elsewhere often 

00:01:23.760 --> 00:01:25.610
 of Rhodesia or Kenya 

00:01:25.610 --> 00:01:28.700
 who does not know if we even remember when cars cluttering at 

00:01:28.700 --> 00:01:30.290
 left not right 

00:01:30.290 --> 00:01:33.170
 potok to win a lot of rallies with drivers at the very English time 

00:01:33.170 --> 00:01:37.510
 known as levitic life and everyone to leave an Indian pilot does not bring 

00:01:37.510 --> 00:01:40.250
 very well known in African rally everything is ok already 

00:01:40.250 --> 00:01:44.020
 which allowed peugeot to establish its reputation in motorsport 

00:01:44.980 --> 00:01:48.730
 in 1965 a prototype based on cabriolets 

00:01:48.730 --> 00:01:51.730
 is assembled to break world records 

00:01:54.080 --> 00:01:58.390
 it is equipped successively with 2 diesel engines it will beat 40 record of 

00:01:58.390 --> 00:02:01.480
 world on the speed ring of noise cpu near paris 

00:02:06.220 --> 00:02:09.170
 peugeot will be able to find his knowledge and his abilities in 

00:02:09.170 --> 00:02:10.639
 Diesel engine material 

00:02:10.639 --> 00:02:13.689
 at a time when very few brands have specialized in this area 

00:02:27.969 --> 00:02:32.269
 after breaking the record from 5 8 km to 160 km average 

00:02:32.789 --> 00:02:38.039
 the 404 records broke that of the km setpoints at 161 kilometers hour 

00:02:38.039 --> 00:02:42.299
 average thus reinforcing the image of the brand in an area where mercedes 

00:02:42.299 --> 00:02:45.299
 pain was believed until their domination 

00:02:56.319 --> 00:02:59.919
 today this historic copy and preserved by the museum of the adventurous 

00:02:59.919 --> 00:03:02.919
 peugeot in sochaux among the other models in the collection 

00:03:03.669 --> 00:03:06.989
 all these pieces of heritage maintained by the museum workshop 

00:03:07.559 --> 00:03:10.559
 certainly regularly for exhibitions besson 

00:03:15.869 --> 00:03:19.169
 more likely did the stock business have done globally 

00:03:19.169 --> 00:03:23.339
 the repair and maintenance of all the equipment proposed by the 

00:03:23.339 --> 00:03:24.279
 collection 

00:03:24.279 --> 00:03:28.359
 so that's the cars, the bikes and the bikes, but also the cars 

00:03:28.359 --> 00:03:30.159
 objects 

00:03:30.159 --> 00:03:33.159
 it consists of the collection 

00:03:33.709 --> 00:03:37.439
 the restoration work for basically breaks down four doors 

00:03:37.439 --> 00:03:38.959
 four main activities 

00:03:38.959 --> 00:03:40.899
 so that according to the sheet metal 

00:03:40.899 --> 00:03:43.219
 % the mecanic 

00:03:43.219 --> 00:03:46.890
 so classify the city all light wounded and therefore music since 

00:03:46.889 --> 00:03:49.969
 big all cars 

00:03:49.969 --> 00:03:53.849
 ps old will not gather on a timber frame so we need 

00:03:53.849 --> 00:03:55.039
 two 

00:03:55.039 --> 00:03:58.489
 we need to restore it's gone to leave 

00:03:58.489 --> 00:04:03.139
 the importance of catering for a car or the importance of a port 

00:04:03.139 --> 00:04:06.219
 French to keep the car in its original state 

00:04:06.219 --> 00:04:08.619
 pl of power 

00:04:08.619 --> 00:04:11.149
 the reexploitation terms of images in terms of 

00:04:11.149 --> 00:04:14.149
 reliability and reliability to put it back on the road 

00:04:15.209 --> 00:04:16.819
 in good conditions 

00:04:16.819 --> 00:04:19.889
 we can talk about labor is optional we can already talk about the aspirations of 

00:04:19.889 --> 00:04:22.800
 80 years ago today it is a model that is very appreciated by 

00:04:22.800 --> 00:04:23.800
 collectors 

00:04:23.800 --> 00:04:25.710
 so this is a model that 

00:04:25.710 --> 00:04:28.520
 it generates a lot of activity in terms of restoration 

00:04:28.520 --> 00:04:32.150
 the new number yes this year sometimes on the a4 actually it's a 

00:04:32.150 --> 00:04:34.509
 vehicle 

00:04:34.509 --> 00:04:37.229
 interesting to the extent that we can remake something 

00:04:37.229 --> 00:04:40.809
 to do without it and easily trudy muller due to availability 

00:04:40.809 --> 00:04:41.779
 always 

00:04:41.779 --> 00:04:44.479
 today spare parts 

00:04:44.479 --> 00:04:46.860
 moreover it is a model 

00:04:46.860 --> 00:04:48.740
 who was famous if he was black 

00:04:48.740 --> 00:04:49.470
 tough 

00:04:49.470 --> 00:04:50.919
 and so 

00:04:50.919 --> 00:04:52.569
 advantageous sall 

00:04:52.569 --> 00:04:56.669
 in onboard catering will be like a car once his car 

00:04:56.669 --> 00:04:59.550
 to find cars in relatively good condition 

00:04:59.550 --> 00:05:01.860
 I am a mechanic at the museum workshop 

00:05:01.860 --> 00:05:05.129
 I would say it's a good car for someone who wants to get started 

00:05:05.129 --> 00:05:06.710
 in the restaurant business 

00:05:06.710 --> 00:05:10.100
 because this car that remains easy to mechanics 

00:05:10.710 --> 00:05:13.710
 and for me it's comfortable it's a car you can still ride 

00:05:14.699 --> 00:05:18.490
 ride in town not to interfere with his passes not yet there the old car 

00:05:18.490 --> 00:05:21.439
 then it is encouraging them to comfort them to go for miles 

00:05:21.439 --> 00:05:23.339
 of the 

00:05:23.339 --> 00:05:26.710
 the problems of under-roofing 

00:05:26.710 --> 00:05:30.300
 as some people said she had a little light handling 

00:05:30.969 --> 00:05:33.840
 maybe the duo the ratio of his power 

00:05:33.840 --> 00:05:36.279
 of his handling 

00:05:36.279 --> 00:05:38.749
 and not many flaws I think 

00:05:38.749 --> 00:05:41.999
 car workers in europe 

00:05:41.999 --> 00:05:44.999
 we did all the cars interior courses 

00:05:45.639 --> 00:05:46.969
 for 100 m 

00:05:46.969 --> 00:05:48.129
 it's not a fault 

00:05:48.129 --> 00:05:51.659
 only the seats the panels the carpet all 

00:05:51.659 --> 00:05:53.059
 all that is forbidden 

00:05:53.059 --> 00:05:56.369
 for the richest those who want to remake a broom-car 

00:05:56.369 --> 00:06:00.649
 in the design of the CEO we will do with the same car 

00:06:01.529 --> 00:06:05.839
 it gives airs so that it comes 7% with terraferma of all 

00:06:06.469 --> 00:06:08.779
 original teacher can happen 

00:06:08.779 --> 00:06:11.749
 the gateway to the same as elsewhere in the photo 

00:06:11.749 --> 00:06:13.119
 participation 

00:06:13.119 --> 00:06:16.319
 it also has the immediate effect of a version kayane land in Spain 

00:06:17.270 --> 00:06:18.589
 perforated 

00:06:18.589 --> 00:06:20.289

00:06:20.289 --> 00:06:23.590
 a the cut to leather readers 

00:06:24.719 --> 00:06:25.790
 coupe cabriolet 

00:06:25.790 --> 00:06:27.539
 but she 

00:06:27.539 --> 00:06:30.849
 all leather actors 

00:06:30.849 --> 00:06:34.849
 one of our heads to see where it depends on the color of the room

00:06:37.089 --> 00:06:40.339
 with impunity% plastic cotton for waterproofing 

00:06:41.900 --> 00:06:51.840
 the panels will be against is not our offer understands why 5 the

 sedan alone move one million six hundred thousand copies 

00:06:56.240 --> 00:07:00.150
 out of a total of two million two hundred thousand copies of 404 strict 

00:07:00.150 --> 00:07:02.050
 all versions combined ap 

00:07:02.050 --> 00:07:05.569
 like the coupe and the convertible it now has many 

00:07:05.569 --> 00:07:09.889
 faithful who loves his baroque style very representative of the 1960s

 Assembly 

00:07:29.630 --> 00:07:31.879
 and it's a 404 

00:07:31.879 --> 00:07:35.129
 since production has been multiplied by ten 

00:07:35.129 --> 00:07:39.429
 but the 404 remain the symbol of an era revives a relay race 

00:07:39.429 --> 00:07:40.529
 and enduring 

00:07:40.529 --> 00:07:43.859
