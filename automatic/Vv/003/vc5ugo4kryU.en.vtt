board<00:05:18.270> around<00:05:18.630> the<00:05:18.780> cabinets<00:05:19.170> because<00:05:19.470> these

00:05:19.610 --> 00:05:19.620 
board around the cabinets because these

00:05:19.620 --> 00:05:21.440 
board around the cabinets because these
cabinets<00:05:20.040> I<00:05:20.160> just<00:05:20.370> would<00:05:20.640> like<00:05:20.940> the<00:05:21.060> option<00:05:21.210> of

00:05:21.440 --> 00:05:21.450 
cabinets I just would like the option of

00:05:21.450 --> 00:05:25.670 
cabinets I just would like the option of
moving<00:05:21.690> them<00:05:21.840> around<00:05:23.720> and<00:05:24.720> now<00:05:25.200> I'm<00:05:25.350> trying<00:05:25.590> to

00:05:25.670 --> 00:05:25.680 
moving them around and now I'm trying to

00:05:25.680 --> 00:05:27.530 
moving them around and now I'm trying to
figure<00:05:25.860> out<00:05:26.100> how<00:05:26.430> I<00:05:26.460> want<00:05:26.790> to<00:05:26.880> lay<00:05:27.000> my<00:05:27.150> wood<00:05:27.360> out

00:05:27.530 --> 00:05:27.540 
figure out how I want to lay my wood out

00:05:27.540 --> 00:05:29.510 
figure out how I want to lay my wood out
because<00:05:27.840> I've<00:05:27.990> only<00:05:28.200> got<00:05:28.380> so<00:05:28.620> much<00:05:28.800> I<00:05:29.130> kind<00:05:29.490> of

00:05:29.510 --> 00:05:29.520 
because I've only got so much I kind of

00:05:29.520 --> 00:05:33.340 
because I've only got so much I kind of
want<00:05:29.700> it<00:05:29.730> to<00:05:29.880> go<00:05:30.000> like<00:05:30.150> this<00:05:30.440> I'm<00:05:31.440> vertical<00:05:32.330> but

00:05:33.340 --> 00:05:33.350 
want it to go like this I'm vertical but

00:05:33.350 --> 00:05:35.810 
want it to go like this I'm vertical but
doing<00:05:34.350> the<00:05:34.440> layout<00:05:34.620> I've<00:05:34.980> figured<00:05:35.310> out<00:05:35.520> that

00:05:35.810 --> 00:05:35.820 
doing the layout I've figured out that

00:05:35.820 --> 00:05:37.400 
doing the layout I've figured out that
there's<00:05:36.240> a<00:05:36.330> better<00:05:36.510> way<00:05:36.660> to<00:05:36.690> do<00:05:36.930> this<00:05:37.080> so

00:05:37.400 --> 00:05:37.410 
there's a better way to do this so

00:05:37.410 --> 00:05:39.410 
there's a better way to do this so
inside<00:05:38.220> you<00:05:38.400> can<00:05:38.520> see<00:05:38.640> the<00:05:38.760> windowsill<00:05:39.150> I<00:05:39.180> have

00:05:39.410 --> 00:05:39.420 
inside you can see the windowsill I have

00:05:39.420 --> 00:05:41.000 
inside you can see the windowsill I have
it<00:05:39.510> all<00:05:39.600> in<00:05:39.780> there<00:05:40.020> all<00:05:40.230> wrapped<00:05:40.590> around<00:05:40.710> I

00:05:41.000 --> 00:05:41.010 
it all in there all wrapped around I

00:05:41.010 --> 00:05:42.290 
it all in there all wrapped around I
have<00:05:41.190> a<00:05:41.220> couple<00:05:41.580> long<00:05:41.700> pieces<00:05:42.090> that<00:05:42.210> go

00:05:42.290 --> 00:05:42.300 
have a couple long pieces that go

00:05:42.300 --> 00:05:45.500 
have a couple long pieces that go
floor-to-ceiling<00:05:42.720> on<00:05:43.380> each<00:05:43.590> window<00:05:44.390> you<00:05:45.390> know

00:05:45.500 --> 00:05:45.510 
floor-to-ceiling on each window you know

00:05:45.510 --> 00:05:46.430 
floor-to-ceiling on each window you know
I'm<00:05:45.600> not<00:05:45.690> really<00:05:45.900> too<00:05:46.170> worried<00:05:46.380> about

00:05:46.430 --> 00:05:46.440 
I'm not really too worried about

00:05:46.440 --> 00:05:48.530 
I'm not really too worried about
