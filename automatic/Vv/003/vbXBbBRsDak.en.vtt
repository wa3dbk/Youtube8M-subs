00:03:27.500 --> 00:03:27.510 

00:03:27.510 --> 00:03:34.040 

the<00:03:28.080> Chester

00:03:34.040 --> 00:03:34.050 

00:03:34.050 --> 00:03:40.620 

and<00:03:35.580> extender<00:03:36.580> for<00:03:39.120> connecting<00:03:40.120> this<00:03:40.300> to<00:03:40.360> your

00:03:40.620 --> 00:03:40.630 
and extender for connecting this to your

00:03:40.630 --> 00:03:46.410 
and extender for connecting this to your
system<00:03:41.700> so<00:03:42.700> that<00:03:42.730> is<00:03:43.060> pretty<00:03:43.210> good<00:03:45.210> far<00:03:46.210> from

00:03:46.410 --> 00:03:46.420 
system so that is pretty good far from

00:03:46.420 --> 00:03:50.220 
system so that is pretty good far from
that<00:03:46.510> you<00:03:46.810> get<00:03:46.990> a<00:03:48.810> warranty<00:03:49.810> card<00:03:49.990> probably

00:03:50.220 --> 00:03:50.230 
that you get a warranty card probably

00:03:50.230 --> 00:03:52.050 
that you get a warranty card probably
just<00:03:50.710> completely<00:03:51.070> in<00:03:51.190> Chinese<00:03:51.520> so<00:03:51.670> it's<00:03:51.700> quite

00:03:52.050 --> 00:03:52.060 
just completely in Chinese so it's quite

00:03:52.060 --> 00:03:54.420 
just completely in Chinese so it's quite
hard<00:03:52.360> to<00:03:52.450> understand<00:03:52.930> but<00:03:53.110> seeing<00:03:53.830> the<00:03:54.040> fields

00:03:54.420 --> 00:03:54.430 
hard to understand but seeing the fields

00:03:54.430 --> 00:03:56.010 
hard to understand but seeing the fields
which<00:03:54.640> will<00:03:54.820> surely<00:03:55.060> it<00:03:55.210> seems<00:03:55.630> like<00:03:55.870> it<00:03:55.990> is

00:03:56.010 --> 00:03:56.020 
which will surely it seems like it is

00:03:56.020 --> 00:03:57.720 
which will surely it seems like it is
asking<00:03:56.470> for<00:03:56.650> the<00:03:56.710> name<00:03:56.860> another<00:03:57.100> data<00:03:57.400> and

00:03:57.720 --> 00:03:57.730 
asking for the name another data and

00:03:57.730 --> 00:04:00.870 
asking for the name another data and
then<00:03:58.480> this<00:03:58.750> is<00:03:58.900> the<00:03:58.930> vanity<00:03:59.380> card<00:03:59.590> but<00:03:59.890> since

00:04:00.870 --> 00:04:00.880 
then this is the vanity card but since

00:04:00.880 --> 00:04:03.410 
then this is the vanity card but since
it's<00:04:01.060> from<00:04:01.210> China<00:04:01.420> you<00:04:01.570> cannot<00:04:01.810> expect<00:04:02.110> any

00:04:03.410 --> 00:04:03.420 
it's from China you cannot expect any

00:04:03.420 --> 00:04:06.390 
it's from China you cannot expect any
replacement<00:04:04.420> as<00:04:04.570> such<00:04:04.980> apart<00:04:05.980> from<00:04:06.070> that<00:04:06.160> this

00:04:06.390 --> 00:04:06.400 
replacement as such apart from that this

00:04:06.400 --> 00:04:08.730 
replacement as such apart from that this
looks<00:04:06.640> like<00:04:06.790> a<00:04:06.850> product<00:04:07.180> manual<00:04:07.660> but<00:04:08.590> as

00:04:08.730 --> 00:04:08.740 
looks like a product manual but as

00:04:08.740 --> 00:04:10.650 
looks like a product manual but as
mentioned<00:04:09.010> earlier<00:04:09.310> this<00:04:10.000> is<00:04:10.060> again<00:04:10.480> in

so<00:04:51.610> as<00:04:51.730> you<00:04:51.820> can<00:04:51.910> see<00:04:52.030> there's<00:04:52.180> a<00:04:52.210> little<00:04:52.240> bit

00:04:52.470 --> 00:04:52.480 
so as you can see there's a little bit

00:04:52.480 --> 00:04:55.230 
so as you can see there's a little bit
of<00:04:52.540> difference<00:04:52.810> already<00:04:53.169> in<00:04:53.470> the<00:04:53.650> size<00:04:54.240> even

00:04:55.230 --> 00:04:55.240 
of difference already in the size even

00:04:55.240 --> 00:04:57.270 
of difference already in the size even
though<00:04:55.330> this<00:04:55.480> both<00:04:56.350> of<00:04:56.560> the<00:04:56.680> same<00:04:56.890> are<00:04:57.070> again

00:04:57.270 --> 00:04:57.280 
though this both of the same are again

00:04:57.280 --> 00:05:02.010 
though this both of the same are again
seven<00:04:57.580> inches<00:04:57.790> so<00:04:58.540> it's<00:04:58.660> clear<00:04:58.930> that<00:05:01.020> the

00:05:02.010 --> 00:05:02.020 
seven inches so it's clear that the

00:05:02.020 --> 00:05:05.670 
seven inches so it's clear that the
enemy<00:05:02.560> LF<00:05:03.490> the<00:05:03.669> new<00:05:03.820> one<00:05:04.030> looks<00:05:04.540> a<00:05:04.990> little<00:05:05.500> bit

00:05:05.670 --> 00:05:05.680 
enemy LF the new one looks a little bit

00:05:05.680 --> 00:05:08.100 
enemy LF the new one looks a little bit
bigger<00:05:05.890> in<00:05:06.370> terms<00:05:06.850> of<00:05:07.060> external<00:05:07.630> dimensions

00:05:08.100 --> 00:05:08.110 
bigger in terms of external dimensions

00:05:08.110 --> 00:05:10.290 
bigger in terms of external dimensions
but<00:05:08.770> again<00:05:09.040> what<00:05:09.280> is<00:05:09.580> important<00:05:10.030> is<00:05:10.120> the

00:05:10.290 --> 00:05:10.300 
but again what is important is the

00:05:10.300 --> 00:05:13.530 
but again what is important is the
performance<00:05:10.840> and<00:05:11.050> work<00:05:11.350> other<00:05:12.310> features<00:05:12.540> so

00:05:13.530 --> 00:05:13.540 
performance and work other features so

00:05:13.540 --> 00:05:15.960 
performance and work other features so
stay<00:05:14.110> tuned<00:05:14.260> for<00:05:14.740> the<00:05:14.770> next<00:05:14.919> set<00:05:15.669> of<00:05:15.700> our
