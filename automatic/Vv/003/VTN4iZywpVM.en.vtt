00:00:16.260 --> 00:00:16.270 
billion parts so we're going to go ahead

00:00:16.270 --> 00:00:19.050 
billion parts so we're going to go ahead
and<00:00:16.779> cycle<00:00:17.590> through<00:00:17.800> each<00:00:17.830> of<00:00:18.099> those<00:00:18.220> before

00:00:19.050 --> 00:00:19.060

we do that dip in your reeds in water is
much<00:00:23.439> faster<00:00:23.860> than<00:00:24.630> having<00:00:25.630> it<00:00:25.720> in<00:00:25.840> your<00:00:25.869> mouth

00:00:31.859 --> 00:00:31.869 
strongly strongly recommend is that you

00:00:31.869 --> 00:00:35.190 
strongly strongly recommend is that you
thoroughly<00:00:32.550> soak<00:00:33.550> your<00:00:33.790> reeds<00:00:34.059> but<00:00:34.660> not<00:00:34.899> too

much what we're gonna do is we're gonna
open<00:00:38.170> up<00:00:38.440> the<00:00:38.559> case<00:00:38.829> and<00:00:39.329> as<00:00:40.329> with<00:00:40.840> most<00:00:41.079> cases

00:00:41.490 --> 00:00:41.500 
open up the case and as with most cases

00:00:41.500 --> 00:00:44.459 
open up the case and as with most cases
there's<00:00:42.129> a<00:00:42.219> right<00:00:42.610> way<00:00:42.640> and<00:00:43.149> a<00:00:43.329> wrong<00:00:43.360> way<00:00:43.660> to

00:00:44.459 --> 00:00:44.469 
there's a right way and a wrong way to

00:00:44.469 --> 00:00:47.400 
there's a right way and a wrong way to
open<00:00:44.829> it<00:00:44.920> make<00:00:45.460> sure<00:00:45.539> that<00:00:46.539> the<00:00:46.719> bottom<00:00:46.989> of<00:00:47.320> the

00:00:47.400 --> 00:00:47.410 
open it make sure that the bottom of the

00:00:47.410 --> 00:00:51.689 
open it make sure that the bottom of the
case<00:00:47.679> is<00:00:48.780> on<00:00:49.780> the<00:00:49.809> bottom<00:00:50.320> of<00:00:50.350> whatever<00:00:51.129> your

00:00:51.689 --> 00:00:51.699 
case is on the bottom of whatever your

00:00:51.699 --> 00:00:53.880 
case is on the bottom of whatever your
sitting<00:00:52.030> the<00:00:52.120> case<00:00:52.329> on<00:00:52.570> and<00:00:52.870> at<00:00:53.289> the<00:00:53.350> top<00:00:53.679> of

00:00:53.880 --> 00:00:53.890 
sitting the case on and at the top of

00:00:53.890 --> 00:00:56.099 
sitting the case on and at the top of
the<00:00:53.980> case<00:00:54.219> is<00:00:54.519> what<00:00:54.789> opens<00:00:55.269> because<00:00:55.749> you<00:00:55.870> don't

00:00:56.099 --> 00:00:56.109 
the case is what opens because you don't

00:00:56.109 --> 00:00:57.479 
the case is what opens because you don't
want<00:00:56.379> to<00:00:56.469> have<00:00:56.589> the<00:00:56.739> bassoon<00:00:57.039> fall<00:00:57.309> out<00:00:57.460> over
