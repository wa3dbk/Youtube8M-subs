00:02:59.730 --> 00:03:02.660 
get I think to go two gigabytes of a
data<00:03:00.270> plan<00:03:00.510> I<00:03:00.630> think<00:03:00.930> it's<00:03:01.050> a<00:03:01.110> great<00:03:01.370> way<00:03:02.370> to<00:03:02.430> go

00:03:02.660 --> 00:03:02.670 
data plan I think it's a great way to go

00:03:02.670 --> 00:03:05.860 
data plan I think it's a great way to go
any<00:03:02.970> less<00:03:03.420> I<00:03:03.780> think<00:03:04.200> you'll<00:03:04.350> be<00:03:04.470> a<00:03:04.760> struggling

00:03:05.860 --> 00:03:05.870 
any less I think you'll be a struggling

any less I think you'll be a struggling
you<00:03:06.870> know<00:03:06.990> with<00:03:07.230> your<00:03:07.440> self-imposed<00:03:08.250> data<00:03:08.550> cap

00:03:08.840 --> 00:03:08.850 
you know with your self-imposed data cap

00:03:08.850 --> 00:03:11.360 
you know with your self-imposed data cap
and<00:03:09.120> anymore<00:03:10.080> I<00:03:10.350> think<00:03:10.830> if<00:03:10.950> you<00:03:11.040> want<00:03:11.220> to<00:03:11.280> look

00:03:11.360 --> 00:03:11.370 
and anymore I think if you want to look

00:03:11.370 --> 00:03:13.460 
and anymore I think if you want to look
at<00:03:11.490> videos<00:03:11.820> i<00:03:12.030> think<00:03:12.270> that's<00:03:12.960> when<00:03:13.200> you<00:03:13.320> go<00:03:13.440> up

00:03:13.460 --> 00:03:13.470 
at videos i think that's when you go up

00:03:13.470 --> 00:03:15.860 
at videos i think that's when you go up
to<00:03:13.710> the<00:03:13.830> higher<00:03:14.010> you<00:03:14.250> could<00:03:14.370> buy<00:03:14.460> packages<00:03:15.000> or

00:03:15.860 --> 00:03:15.870 
to the higher you could buy packages or

00:03:15.870 --> 00:03:17.930 
to the higher you could buy packages or
if<00:03:16.200> you<00:03:16.290> want<00:03:16.470> to<00:03:16.530> make<00:03:16.680> a<00:03:16.709> phone<00:03:17.430> call<00:03:17.760> us
