 george armenia of beatniks explained 

00:00:03.340 --> 00:00:06.470
 in just a few minutes 

00:00:06.470 --> 00:00:09.389
 well seen welcome to trigger in mini 

00:00:09.389 --> 00:00:12.259
 go through your misfortunes and those which besides many makes me 

00:00:12.259 --> 00:00:14.979
 pleasure that there are practical questions about the material 

00:00:14.979 --> 00:00:17.949
 I notice that for some time questions about the accessories of 

00:00:17.949 --> 00:00:20.029
 flash come on a very regular basis 

00:00:20.029 --> 00:00:23.449
 and it is true that there is a lot of products between 10 and 60 euros say who 

00:00:23.449 --> 00:00:27.929
 pretend to improve flash photos I think said mikko is I 

00:00:27.929 --> 00:00:30.309
 think of a product that is currently much talked about in the forums 

00:00:30.309 --> 00:00:31.980
 blatiÃ¨re of gary phong 

00:00:31.980 --> 00:00:33.480
 what about these products 

00:00:33.480 --> 00:00:36.390
 what about the small light boxes that we propose porting 

00:00:36.390 --> 00:00:38.040
 reportage 

00:00:38.040 --> 00:00:41.500
 it takes to publicity portrait need beatus to so-called lights 

00:00:41.500 --> 00:00:42.460
 fresh 

00:00:42.460 --> 00:00:45.350
 khadir lights very flattering because they are not going thin and 

00:00:45.350 --> 00:00:48.740
 unfortunately they do not diminish and just be buried 

00:00:48.740 --> 00:00:50.469
 and after idea the pockets 

00:00:50.469 --> 00:00:52.200
 and all other skin defects 

00:00:52.200 --> 00:00:55.270
 and all its accessories that we can mount his case this report is well 

00:00:55.270 --> 00:00:55.870
 a researcher 

00:00:55.870 --> 00:00:57.229
 backed by the light 

00:00:57.229 --> 00:01:00.200
 to get close to this glamorous image 

00:01:00.200 --> 00:01:02.530
 let's start with the beginning of the lights 

00:01:02.530 --> 00:01:06.300
 take a photo of a subject in front of the wall first photo flash use 

00:01:06.300 --> 00:01:07.890
 just the built-in flash 

00:01:07.890 --> 00:01:10.670
 I would like a shadow projected on the walls 

00:01:10.670 --> 00:01:12.110
 shaded very quickly 

00:01:12.110 --> 00:01:13.790
 and like cutting with a knife 

00:01:13.790 --> 00:01:16.659
 straps the passage of light to london 

00:01:16.659 --> 00:01:17.850
 and porical 

00:01:17.850 --> 00:01:22.100
 so precisely brunet season is brutal very marked and secular hard that 

00:01:22.100 --> 00:01:24.520
 will accentuate the defects of the skin 

00:01:24.520 --> 00:01:27.970
 by default the flash produces a hard light and to have a light 

00:01:27.970 --> 00:01:28.990
 sweet it takes 

00:01:28.990 --> 00:01:29.990
 it is enough 

00:01:29.990 --> 00:01:33.630
 to enlarge the size of the light source because the secret is that 

00:01:34.150 --> 00:01:37.150
 plus the c40 light source compared to subjects 

00:01:37.760 --> 00:01:40.780
 the softer the light 

00:01:40.780 --> 00:01:44.800
 what these accessories seek to do is simply then tell the source 

00:01:44.799 --> 00:01:46.140
 light 

00:01:46.140 --> 00:01:47.800
 and that's very simple 

00:01:47.800 --> 00:01:51.780
 despite all that you will read in the brochures to unite softer it takes 

00:01:51.780 --> 00:01:54.850
 an accessory the largest possible and that's why we practice 

00:01:54.850 --> 00:01:57.670
 see very little difference between accessories 

00:01:57.670 --> 00:01:59.070
 whether it's listening 

00:01:59.070 --> 00:02:03.270
 a gary fung folded papers a light box portage reportage 

00:02:03.270 --> 00:02:06.840
 they are all subject to the mam constraints that come directly from the holidays 

00:02:06.840 --> 00:02:09.269
 reports and so they have overall the same size 

00:02:09.269 --> 00:02:12.299
 so the effects are not so far apart 

00:02:12.299 --> 00:02:15.159
 so how to choose but I believe that we must be guided by the 

00:02:15.159 --> 00:02:18.309
 quality of materials the strength their commitment the price the side 

00:02:18.309 --> 00:02:21.699
 practice of the accessory compared to the photos that you practiced 

00:02:21.699 --> 00:02:25.099
 for example I used to Nicolet this for years it's a product that 

00:02:25.099 --> 00:02:27.359
 works fine there is not a fault 

00:02:27.359 --> 00:02:30.419
 and you can only use it as landscape orientation 

00:02:30.419 --> 00:02:33.609
 today more often use a kaifeng origami 

00:02:33.609 --> 00:02:37.219
 simply because it can be used in landscape and will wear 

00:02:38.039 --> 00:02:40.509
 we can orient the device as we want 

00:02:40.509 --> 00:02:43.389
 for me it's important it was not for you 

00:02:43.389 --> 00:02:47.549
 in both cases I wanted a product that folds as small as possible 

00:02:47.549 --> 00:02:49.679
 but beware the origami is not perfect 

00:02:49.679 --> 00:02:53.299
 he needs a ceiling clear plan because they do not use the 

00:02:53.299 --> 00:02:55.999
 ceiling to reflect a big part of the light 

00:02:55.999 --> 00:02:59.839
 him christoph ousseni like that it is also said that the uncertainties 

00:02:59.839 --> 00:03:02.819
 were to get by when we did not have a white ceiling or when we 

00:03:02.819 --> 00:03:04.129
 outdoor photography 

00:03:04.129 --> 00:03:07.170
 advantages and disadvantages to each product and the choice we go the 

00:03:07.169 --> 00:03:09.209
 to do according to the ruhr photography 

00:03:09.209 --> 00:03:10.879
 from how photographic 

00:03:10.879 --> 00:03:13.779
 I mentioned it earlier and many other accessories I am 

00:03:13.779 --> 00:03:16.629
 persuaded that in the comments share your experience with the 

00:03:16.629 --> 00:03:18.579
 product you prefer to use 

00:03:18.579 --> 00:03:21.459
 and what was important to keep in mind if you want to buy one 

00:03:21.459 --> 00:03:22.500
 it's true 

00:03:22.500 --> 00:03:24.339
 size of the light source that counts 

00:03:24.339 --> 00:03:26.999
 and we understand shory say we tried in vain 

00:03:26.999 --> 00:03:28.349
 ask here all 

00:03:28.349 --> 00:03:30.849
 we can change for a more practical project but change the size 

00:03:30.849 --> 00:03:33.199
 equivalent it is not worth it 

00:03:33.199 --> 00:03:35.249
 in conclusion these products are useful 

00:03:35.249 --> 00:03:37.439
 it takes a real difference in the photo 

00:03:37.439 --> 00:03:40.389
 I must not be fooled either I spoke on the glamorous side I was leaving 

00:03:40.389 --> 00:03:41.899
 advertising fraud side 

00:03:41.899 --> 00:03:44.930
 it remains accessories for report flash 

00:03:44.930 --> 00:03:48.289
 and so they are limited by the sinking power the reportage 

00:03:48.289 --> 00:03:50.959
 to really go to the next level or a real difference 

00:03:50.959 --> 00:03:54.469
 we need more powerful flashes in comparison with the origami of nicolet this 

00:03:54.469 --> 00:03:57.049
 that I use a displacement I also have light boxes 

00:03:57.049 --> 00:03:58.909
 which one of more than one meter fifty 

00:03:58.909 --> 00:04:00.180
 that is to say a light source 

00:04:00.180 --> 00:04:01.939
 why bigger than a bust 

00:04:01.939 --> 00:04:04.079
 so yesterday on lights which are they 

00:04:04.079 --> 00:04:05.399
 much softer 

00:04:05.399 --> 00:04:08.049
 obviously how big fortunes 11 

00:04:08.049 --> 00:04:11.310
 frank h very powerful propofol used for what I'm tough 

00:04:11.310 --> 00:04:13.900
 it obviously has so much more difficult to slip into a bag of 

00:04:13.900 --> 00:04:14.749
 reportage 

00:04:14.749 --> 00:04:16.450
 I end with three tips 

00:04:16.450 --> 00:04:19.490
 there are also a lot of system solutions of favorites that are with 

00:04:19.490 --> 00:04:22.590
 civic pact of the most diverse to search a little bit on the internet 

00:04:22.590 --> 00:04:26.130
 the result is as good a professional product because I repeat it 

00:04:26.130 --> 00:04:28.610
 only the size of the light source 

00:04:28.610 --> 00:04:30.840
 in relation to subjects 

00:04:30.840 --> 00:04:34.060
 because we happened are often more fragile you have to be very silky 

00:04:34.060 --> 00:04:37.289
 to have a light that distributes well damage 

00:04:37.289 --> 00:04:41.110
 second advice the principle there is nothing more is also universal there is 

00:04:41.110 --> 00:04:42.909
 absolutely not reserved for flashes 

00:04:42.909 --> 00:04:45.120
 you can apply it in full sun too 

00:04:45.120 --> 00:04:48.610
 for example if you wait for the passage of a cloud to spread the light a 

00:04:48.610 --> 00:04:50.689
 little bit of sun 

00:04:50.689 --> 00:04:53.099
 finally the third council restricts there 

00:04:53.099 --> 00:04:55.899
 Thursday soft lights are flattering but sometimes it's 

00:04:55.899 --> 00:04:58.479
 interesting not to be flattering with a subject 

00:04:58.479 --> 00:05:00.779
 they are proven springboard to his mail 

00:05:00.779 --> 00:05:03.949
 if you have a stone for example but there they want to use soon 

00:05:03.949 --> 00:05:04.999
 the opening 

00:05:04.999 --> 00:05:06.529
 as always the whole flash 

00:05:06.529 --> 00:05:09.240
 it is that we adapt the light also 

00:05:09.240 --> 00:05:12.000
 as for him touched a balloon each his tastes
