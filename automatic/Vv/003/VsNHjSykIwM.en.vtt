your oil seed rape problem we need to
look<00:00:09.920> at<00:00:10.100> two<00:00:10.460> things

00:00:10.840 --> 00:00:10.850 
look at two things

00:00:10.850 --> 00:00:12.610 
look at two things
predominantly<00:00:11.600> when<00:00:11.870> we<00:00:11.990> get<00:00:12.139> to<00:00:12.260> the<00:00:12.380> stage

00:00:12.610 --> 00:00:12.620

00:00:12.620 --> 00:00:14.770 
predominantly when we get to the stage
of<00:00:12.800> the<00:00:12.890> season<00:00:13.280> one<00:00:13.460> is<00:00:13.610> the<00:00:13.790> potential

00:00:14.770 --> 00:00:14.780 
of the season one is the potential

00:00:14.780 --> 00:00:16.570 
of the season one is the potential

and<00:00:19.040> everything<00:00:19.130> involved<00:00:19.880> and<00:00:20.090> then<00:00:20.869> look<00:00:21.140> at

00:00:21.220 --> 00:00:21.230 
and everything involved and then look at

00:02:07.499 --> 00:02:07.509 
much better structured plant that's

00:02:07.509 --> 00:02:10.660 
much better structured plant that's

plant<00:02:11.000> population<00:02:11.720> you<00:02:11.840> can<00:02:12.050> see<00:02:12.230> how<00:02:13.010> we've

00:02:13.300 --> 00:02:13.310 
plant population you can see how we've

00:02:13.310 --> 00:02:17.390 
plant population you can see how we've
got<00:02:13.340> on<00:02:13.910> each<00:02:14.270> of<00:02:14.480> these<00:02:14.600> sub<00:02:14.930> branches<00:02:15.460> many

flower<00:02:17.819> buds<00:02:18.120> preparing<00:02:18.750> and<00:02:18.930> so<00:02:19.080> there<00:02:19.290> will

00:02:19.339 --> 00:02:19.349 
flower buds preparing and so there will

00:02:19.349 --> 00:02:21.710 
flower buds preparing and so there will
be<00:02:19.409> a<00:02:19.500> good<00:02:19.769> canopy<00:02:20.159> structure<00:02:20.760> right<00:02:21.299> from

00:02:21.710 --> 00:02:21.720 
be a good canopy structure right from

virgin crop situation it does have quite

00:03:11.180 --> 00:03:11.190 
a lot of potential with them what we

00:03:11.190 --> 00:03:13.460 
a lot of potential with them what we
have<00:03:11.370> and<00:03:11.609> perhaps<00:03:12.090> longer<00:03:12.470> cropping

00:03:13.460 --> 00:03:13.470 
have and perhaps longer cropping

00:03:13.470 --> 00:03:15.920 
have and perhaps longer cropping
rotations<00:03:14.000> or<00:03:15.000> more<00:03:15.299> intensive<00:03:15.750> cropping

00:03:15.920 --> 00:03:15.930

rotations or more intensive cropping
orientations<00:03:16.560> yeah<00:03:17.150> so<00:03:18.150> this<00:03:18.329> is<00:03:18.510> this<00:03:18.810> is<00:03:18.870> art

00:03:19.280 --> 00:03:19.290

this<00:03:19.530> is<00:03:19.680> our<00:03:19.920> tiger<00:03:20.510> and<00:03:21.510> then<00:03:21.720> we've<00:03:21.870> got

00:03:23.110 --> 00:03:23.120 
this is our tiger and then we've got

00:03:23.120 --> 00:03:26.569 
this is our tiger and then we've got
rascal<00:03:24.120> which<00:03:24.750> is<00:03:24.870> a<00:03:24.959> conventional<00:03:25.560> which<00:03:26.430> is

00:03:26.569 --> 00:03:26.579 
rascal which is a conventional which is

00:03:26.579 --> 00:03:32.740 
rascal which is a conventional which is
quite<00:03:26.760> a<00:03:26.849> bit<00:03:27.000> shorter<00:03:29.690> and<00:03:30.690> it's

00:03:32.740 --> 00:03:32.750 
quite a bit shorter and it's

00:03:32.750 --> 00:03:35.960 
quite a bit shorter and it's
yeah<00:03:33.750> and<00:03:34.380> a<00:03:34.590> it's<00:03:35.130> slightly<00:03:35.370> thinner<00:03:35.610> as<00:03:35.790> well

00:03:35.960 --> 00:03:35.970 
yeah and a it's slightly thinner as well

00:03:35.970 --> 00:03:38.150 
yeah and a it's slightly thinner as well
but<00:03:36.660> looking<00:03:36.990> down<00:03:37.170> into<00:03:37.440> the<00:03:37.650> crop<00:03:37.860> if<00:03:38.040> you

00:03:38.150 --> 00:03:38.160 
but looking down into the crop if you

00:03:38.160 --> 00:03:40.460 
but looking down into the crop if you
actually<00:03:38.310> see<00:03:38.610> the<00:03:38.790> flower<00:03:39.000> buds<00:03:39.330> go<00:03:40.200> right<00:03:40.380> to

00:03:40.460 --> 00:03:40.470 
actually see the flower buds go right to

00:03:40.470 --> 00:03:41.840 
actually see the flower buds go right to
the<00:03:40.560> bottom<00:03:40.680> go<00:03:40.920> right<00:03:41.160> to<00:03:41.310> the<00:03:41.430> bottom<00:03:41.610> and

00:03:41.840 --> 00:03:41.850 
the bottom go right to the bottom and

00:03:41.850 --> 00:03:43.970 
the bottom go right to the bottom and
the<00:03:41.940> potential<00:03:42.450> to<00:03:42.510> produce<00:03:42.740> see<00:03:43.740> your<00:03:43.890> the

00:03:43.970 --> 00:03:43.980 
the potential to produce see your the

00:03:43.980 --> 00:03:47.180 
the potential to produce see your the
part<00:03:44.160> of<00:03:44.280> sticker<00:03:44.520> canopy<00:03:45.560> and<00:03:46.560> actually

00:03:47.180 --> 00:03:47.190 
part of sticker canopy and actually

00:03:47.190 --> 00:03:50.480 
part of sticker canopy and actually
produce<00:03:47.340> bigger<00:03:47.910> seeds<00:03:49.220> so<00:03:50.220> instead<00:03:50.430> of

00:03:50.480 --> 00:03:50.490 
produce bigger seeds so instead of

00:03:50.490 --> 00:03:52.670 
produce bigger seeds so instead of
having<00:03:50.730> a<00:03:50.940> narrow<00:03:51.360> band<00:03:51.690> of<00:03:51.930> pods<00:03:52.140> on<00:03:52.380> the<00:03:52.470> top

00:03:52.670 --> 00:03:52.680 
having a narrow band of pods on the top

00:03:52.680 --> 00:04:05.510 
having a narrow band of pods on the top
you'll<00:03:52.950> have<00:03:53.130> a<00:03:53.160> much<00:03:53.370> deeper<00:03:53.610> so<00:04:02.720> right<00:04:04.520> it's

00:04:05.510 --> 00:04:05.520 
you'll have a much deeper so right it's

00:04:05.520 --> 00:04:07.160 
you'll have a much deeper so right it's
the<00:04:05.640> same<00:04:05.850> with<00:04:06.150> the<00:04:06.510> Emilia<00:04:06.870> on<00:04:06.930> the<00:04:07.050> other

the same with the Emilia on the other

00:04:07.170 --> 00:04:11.870 
the same with the Emilia on the other
side<00:04:07.410> there<00:04:07.620> I<00:04:09.650> think<00:04:10.650> I<00:04:10.800> mean<00:04:10.980> for<00:04:11.550> this<00:04:11.670> part

00:04:11.870 --> 00:04:11.880 
side there I think I mean for this part

00:04:11.880 --> 00:04:13.670

00:04:13.670 --> 00:04:13.680 
of walk right Chris right on this side

00:04:13.680 --> 00:04:16.509 
of walk right Chris right on this side
