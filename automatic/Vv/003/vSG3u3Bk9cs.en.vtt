00:01:12.430 --> 00:01:16.340
 Hmm 

00:01:14.290 --> 00:01:18.430
 It looks dark 

00:01:16.340 --> 00:01:25.409
 Hayabusa 

00:01:18.430 --> 00:01:27.130
 I would like to introduce a custom used car of 46 24 rounds to custom 

00:01:25.409 --> 00:01:31.840
 Already good 

00:01:27.130 --> 00:01:37.270
 Although it is a used car customers are attached 

00:01:31.840 --> 00:01:38.799
 For your reference in the fact that selling say it is such as thing as Emergent sample 

00:01:37.270 --> 00:01:43.490
 I think if it becomes 

00:01:38.799 --> 00:01:45.990
 E wheel is hard trouble of back and forth rc 

00:01:43.490 --> 00:01:49.010
 a This side inboard 

00:01:45.990 --> 00:01:54.350
 Because it is a type, on the right side 

00:01:49.010 --> 00:01:56.370
 The type with all the calipers and disc rotors on the left without coming 

00:01:54.350 --> 00:02:02.300
 It is a type that you have attached 

00:01:56.370 --> 00:02:05.390
 I feel that the base looks good pattern of this side of the caramel and Phil 

00:02:02.300 --> 00:02:09.500
 It is a 10-inch swing this is a reinforcement 

00:02:05.390 --> 00:02:13.800
 25 cm long swing arm with reinforcement 

00:02:09.500 --> 00:02:16.069
 blocks of stainless steel polish of alien head of 

00:02:13.800 --> 00:02:18.640
 a muffler yes 

00:02:16.069 --> 00:02:24.670
 Because it is a short type 

00:02:18.640 --> 00:02:26.580
 It is this short It does not interfere with this oil nor this wide wheel 

00:02:24.670 --> 00:02:27.900
 Installation is possible 

00:02:26.580 --> 00:02:29.930
 in addition 

00:02:27.900 --> 00:02:33.970
 Orleans shock 

00:02:29.930 --> 00:02:35.850
 And there is no answer bottle 

00:02:33.970 --> 00:02:41.330
 Mounted 

00:02:35.850 --> 00:02:41.330
 I think it was a bit a while ago that it was custom 

00:02:45.160 --> 00:02:53.030
 I write an 8-meter funnel, but I'm wearing a blinker now 

00:02:50.200 --> 00:02:58.520
 As you saw a little while ago 

00:02:53.030 --> 00:02:59.790
 Now you can see the blinker on the left side and this integrated tail 

00:02:58.520 --> 00:03:03.900
 Just 

00:02:59.790 --> 00:03:06.190
 I can not incorporate my mother in the tail lens 

00:03:03.900 --> 00:03:11.250
 The left side is shining 

00:03:06.190 --> 00:03:11.250
 I have incorporated such parts 

00:03:12.930 --> 00:03:16.370
 Seeing from the left side 

00:03:15.069 --> 00:03:20.569
 in this way 

00:03:16.370 --> 00:03:25.230
 Disc rotors and calipers are a-ko calipers and their 

00:03:20.569 --> 00:03:29.030
 Sprockets are installed side by side in school 

00:03:25.230 --> 00:03:29.030
 It's not blue and it's a Ross bottle 

00:03:29.569 --> 00:03:33.290
 Even as a custom 

00:03:31.340 --> 00:03:36.250
 So quite beautiful 

00:03:33.290 --> 00:03:36.250
 by is good 

00:03:36.400 --> 00:03:41.180
 Backstep to the head 

00:03:38.340 --> 00:03:41.180
 Such feeling 

00:03:41.700 --> 00:03:47.569
 I use art 

00:03:43.400 --> 00:03:50.569
 Top bridge is the chrome type of blocks without this 

00:03:47.569 --> 00:03:54.499
 Attach this as the front can't stick out 

00:03:50.569 --> 00:03:56.859
 After seeing scream It seemed to be suitable for the touring which is a little up 

00:03:54.499 --> 00:03:56.859

00:03:58.790 --> 00:04:06.670
