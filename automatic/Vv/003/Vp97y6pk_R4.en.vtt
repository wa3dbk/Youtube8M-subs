these two I've always wondered about

00:03:41.840 --> 00:03:46.150 
these two I've always wondered about
these<00:03:42.170> little<00:03:42.500> verticals<00:03:43.130> Oh<00:03:45.010> probably<00:03:46.010> some

00:03:46.150 --> 00:03:46.160 
these little verticals Oh probably some

00:03:46.160 --> 00:03:49.540 
these little verticals Oh probably some
verticals<00:03:46.640> in<00:03:46.820> the<00:03:46.970> landscape<00:03:47.510> I<00:03:48.459> don't<00:03:49.459> know

00:03:49.540 --> 00:03:49.550 
verticals in the landscape I don't know

00:03:49.550 --> 00:03:52.600 
verticals in the landscape I don't know
what<00:03:49.760> they<00:03:49.970> are<00:03:51.100> you<00:03:52.100> know<00:03:52.190> here's<00:03:52.489> the

00:03:52.600 --> 00:03:52.610 
what they are you know here's the

00:03:52.610 --> 00:03:54.550 
what they are you know here's the
horizontal<00:03:53.239> that<00:03:53.330> goes<00:03:53.570> into<00:03:53.810> I<00:03:54.200> don't<00:03:54.500> know

00:03:54.550 --> 00:03:54.560 
horizontal that goes into I don't know

00:03:54.560 --> 00:03:56.680 
horizontal that goes into I don't know
it<00:03:54.680> sometimes<00:03:54.890> it's<00:03:55.610> good<00:03:55.850> to<00:03:55.880> be<00:03:56.090> arbitrary

00:03:56.680 --> 00:03:56.690 
it sometimes it's good to be arbitrary

00:03:56.690 --> 00:04:00.690 
it sometimes it's good to be arbitrary
no<00:03:57.410> I<00:03:57.440> said<00:03:58.070> if<00:03:58.220> you're<00:03:58.459> always<00:03:58.670> doing<00:03:59.300> the<00:03:59.510> the

00:04:00.690 --> 00:04:00.700 
no I said if you're always doing the the

00:04:00.700 --> 00:04:03.280 
no I said if you're always doing the the
descriptive<00:04:01.700> thing<00:04:02.030> it's<00:04:02.330> very<00:04:02.600> very<00:04:02.989> boring

00:04:03.280 --> 00:04:03.290 
descriptive thing it's very very boring

00:04:03.290 --> 00:04:07.420 
descriptive thing it's very very boring
and<00:04:04.100> these<00:04:05.230> they're<00:04:06.230> gain<00:04:06.530> that's<00:04:06.800> these<00:04:07.370> are

00:04:07.420 --> 00:04:07.430 
and these they're gain that's these are

00:04:07.430 --> 00:04:11.199 
and these they're gain that's these are
pastels<00:04:08.120> that<00:04:08.510> I<00:04:09.019> made<00:04:09.380> in<00:04:09.739> order<00:04:10.100> to<00:04:10.400> approach

00:04:11.199 --> 00:04:11.209 
pastels that I made in order to approach

00:04:11.209 --> 00:04:13.600 
pastels that I made in order to approach
as<00:04:11.420> closely<00:04:11.660> as<00:04:11.870> possible<00:04:12.019> the<00:04:12.560> idea<00:04:13.310> of<00:04:13.459> a

00:04:13.600 --> 00:04:13.610 
as closely as possible the idea of a

00:04:13.610 --> 00:04:16.599 
as closely as possible the idea of a
minimal<00:04:14.320> surface<00:04:15.320> you<00:04:15.830> know<00:04:15.920> I<00:04:15.950> was<00:04:16.130> much<00:04:16.400> more

00:04:16.599 --> 00:04:16.609 
minimal surface you know I was much more

00:04:16.609 --> 00:04:18.759 
minimal surface you know I was much more
interested<00:04:17.209> in<00:04:17.419> the<00:04:17.989> way<00:04:18.109> I<00:04:18.140> was<00:04:18.290> treating<00:04:18.680> the

00:04:18.759 --> 00:04:18.769 
interested in the way I was treating the

00:04:18.769 --> 00:04:21.900 
interested in the way I was treating the
surface<00:04:19.280> and<00:04:19.549> the<00:04:20.239> textures<00:04:20.780> I<00:04:20.960> could<00:04:21.169> achieve

00:04:21.900 --> 00:04:21.910 
surface and the textures I could achieve

00:04:21.910 --> 00:04:24.060 
surface and the textures I could achieve
this<00:04:22.060> is<00:04:22.240> probably<00:04:22.570> my<00:04:22.990> favorite<00:04:23.020> passage<00:04:23.980> in

00:04:24.060 --> 00:04:24.070 
this is probably my favorite passage in

00:04:24.070 --> 00:04:28.410 
this is probably my favorite passage in
the<00:04:24.340> exhibition<00:04:26.550> well<00:04:27.550> are<00:04:27.700> you<00:04:27.820> so<00:04:28.030> you<00:04:28.300> know

00:04:28.410 --> 00:04:28.420 
the exhibition well are you so you know

00:04:28.420 --> 00:04:33.090 
the exhibition well are you so you know
I<00:04:29.610> like<00:04:30.780> make<00:04:31.780> a<00:04:31.810> battle<00:04:32.140> over<00:04:32.440> these<00:04:32.740> little

00:04:33.090 --> 00:04:33.100 
I like make a battle over these little

00:04:33.100 --> 00:04:35.850 
I like make a battle over these little
things<00:04:33.400> I<00:04:33.730> was<00:04:34.360> also<00:04:34.690> still<00:04:34.930> babysitting<00:04:35.560> them

00:04:35.850 --> 00:04:35.860 
things I was also still babysitting them
