of<00:02:41.730> fun<00:02:41.970> let's<00:02:42.510> run<00:02:42.750> down<00:02:42.930> with<00:02:43.140> a<00:02:43.170> field<00:02:43.440> is

00:02:43.640 --> 00:02:43.650 
of fun let's run down with a field is

00:02:43.650 --> 00:02:46.310 
of fun let's run down with a field is
this<00:02:43.770> for<00:02:43.950> the<00:02:44.040> ships<00:02:44.310> of<00:02:44.490> it<00:02:44.900> let's<00:02:45.900> do<00:02:46.140> that

00:02:46.310 --> 00:02:46.320 
this for the ships of it let's do that

00:02:46.320 --> 00:02:48.170 
this for the ships of it let's do that
let's<00:02:46.740> see<00:02:46.920> how<00:02:47.100> many<00:02:47.160> let's<00:02:47.610> say<00:02:47.700> you<00:02:47.760> hit<00:02:47.910> one

00:02:48.170 --> 00:02:48.180 
let's see how many let's say you hit one

00:02:48.180 --> 00:02:50.840 
let's see how many let's say you hit one
bong<00:02:48.450> good<00:02:49.140> on<00:02:49.290> a<00:02:49.320> for<00:02:49.650> a<00:02:49.890> first<00:02:50.250> session<00:02:50.430> okay

00:02:50.840 --> 00:02:50.850 
bong good on a for a first session okay

00:02:50.850 --> 00:02:53.030 
bong good on a for a first session okay
let's<00:02:51.540> go<00:02:51.690> back<00:02:51.840> down<00:02:52.080> they<00:02:52.230> hit<00:02:52.350> another<00:02:52.470> 15

00:02:53.030 --> 00:02:53.040 
let's go back down they hit another 15

00:02:53.040 --> 00:02:54.560 
let's go back down they hit another 15
balls<00:02:53.310> and<00:02:53.550> let's<00:02:53.670> see<00:02:53.820> how<00:02:53.970> many<00:02:54.000> did<00:02:54.360> balls

00:02:54.560 --> 00:02:54.570 
balls and let's see how many did balls

00:02:54.570 --> 00:02:56.270 
balls and let's see how many did balls
you<00:02:54.780> think<00:02:54.989> come<00:02:55.080> on<00:02:55.170> the<00:02:55.230> back<00:02:55.380> side<00:02:55.620> just<00:02:55.890> to

00:02:56.270 --> 00:02:56.280 
you think come on the back side just to

00:02:56.280 --> 00:02:57.979 
you think come on the back side just to
kind<00:02:56.489> of<00:02:56.550> show<00:02:56.610> you<00:02:56.820> that<00:02:57.120> you<00:02:57.660> know<00:02:57.780> that

00:02:57.979 --> 00:02:57.989 
kind of show you that you know that

00:02:57.989 --> 00:02:59.870 
kind of show you that you know that
stroke<00:02:58.470> going<00:02:59.070> back<00:02:59.280> sentence<00:02:59.670> is<00:02:59.760> much

00:02:59.870 --> 00:02:59.880 
stroke going back sentence is much

00:02:59.880 --> 00:03:01.850 
stroke going back sentence is much
shorter<00:03:00.150> and<00:03:00.570> thus<00:03:01.050> you<00:03:01.380> know<00:03:01.470> yarn<00:03:01.739> is

00:03:01.850 --> 00:03:01.860 
shorter and thus you know yarn is

00:03:01.860 --> 00:03:04.130 
shorter and thus you know yarn is
limited<00:03:02.280> with<00:03:02.790> that<00:03:03.030> so<00:03:03.780> they're<00:03:03.959> you<00:03:04.110> know

00:03:04.130 --> 00:03:04.140 
limited with that so they're you know

00:03:04.140 --> 00:03:06.199 
limited with that so they're you know
even<00:03:04.560> with<00:03:04.650> a<00:03:04.709> wide<00:03:05.070> swing<00:03:05.430> if<00:03:05.670> you<00:03:05.700> could<00:03:05.970> walk

00:03:06.199 --> 00:03:06.209 
even with a wide swing if you could walk

00:03:06.209 --> 00:03:08.479 
even with a wide swing if you could walk
out<00:03:06.480> here<00:03:06.630> today<00:03:06.900> with<00:03:07.650> nothing<00:03:07.980> else<00:03:08.100> you

out here today with nothing else you
know<00:03:08.610> move<00:03:08.880> up<00:03:09.060> in<00:03:09.180> the<00:03:09.270> box<00:03:09.510> of<00:03:10.140> the<00:03:10.290> pit<00:03:10.500> slash

an<00:03:36.750> afternoon<00:03:37.530> session<00:03:37.890> in<00:03:38.280> the<00:03:38.640> next<00:03:38.670> morning

00:03:39.350 --> 00:03:39.360 
an afternoon session in the next morning

00:03:39.360 --> 00:03:41.690 
an afternoon session in the next morning
and<00:03:39.540> this<00:03:40.049> works<00:03:40.320> well<00:03:40.500> because<00:03:40.890> it<00:03:41.220> breaks<00:03:41.459> it

00:03:41.690 --> 00:03:41.700 
and this works well because it breaks it

00:03:41.700 --> 00:03:43.729 
and this works well because it breaks it
up<00:03:41.790> and<00:03:42.000> the<00:03:42.209> hitter<00:03:42.360> has<00:03:42.570> time<00:03:42.959> to<00:03:43.260> absorb<00:03:43.530> the

00:03:43.729 --> 00:03:43.739 
up and the hitter has time to absorb the

00:03:43.739 --> 00:03:45.699 
up and the hitter has time to absorb the
technique<00:03:44.190> and<00:03:44.370> rethink<00:03:44.820> the<00:03:44.940> simple<00:03:45.299> steps

00:03:45.699 --> 00:03:45.709 
technique and rethink the simple steps

00:03:45.709 --> 00:03:49.100 
technique and rethink the simple steps
multiple<00:03:46.709> times<00:03:47.010> was<00:03:47.280> the<00:03:47.310> break<00:03:47.900> we<00:03:48.900> worked

00:03:49.100 --> 00:03:49.110 
multiple times was the break we worked

00:03:49.110 --> 00:03:50.630 
multiple times was the break we worked
out<00:03:49.290> a<00:03:49.320> stronger<00:03:49.709> stride<00:03:50.250> and<00:03:50.459> weight

00:03:50.630 --> 00:03:50.640 
out a stronger stride and weight

00:03:50.640 --> 00:03:53.750 
out a stronger stride and weight
transfer<00:03:51.269> using<00:03:51.450> the<00:03:51.750> rotational<00:03:52.350> trainer<00:03:52.760> we

00:03:53.750 --> 00:03:53.760 
transfer using the rotational trainer we

00:03:53.760 --> 00:03:55.550 
transfer using the rotational trainer we
then<00:03:53.970> implemented<00:03:54.570> the<00:03:54.660> connection<00:03:55.260> good

00:03:55.550 --> 00:03:55.560 
then implemented the connection good

00:03:55.560 --> 00:03:58.520 
then implemented the connection good
stride<00:03:55.950> hip<00:03:56.910> rotation<00:03:57.630> and<00:03:57.840> good<00:03:58.110> point<00:03:58.410> of

00:03:58.520 --> 00:03:58.530 
stride hip rotation and good point of

00:03:58.530 --> 00:04:01.280 
stride hip rotation and good point of

lastly using the T to put the technique

00:04:11.190 --> 00:04:11.720 
lastly using the T to put the technique
together

00:04:11.720 --> 00:04:11.730 
together

00:04:11.730 --> 00:04:14.690

well<00:04:12.420> the<00:04:12.540> T<00:04:12.720> doesn't<00:04:13.110> teach<00:04:13.320> timing<00:04:14.070> the

00:04:14.690 --> 00:04:14.700 
well the T doesn't teach timing the

00:04:14.700 --> 00:04:16.130 
well the T doesn't teach timing the
better<00:04:14.940> your<00:04:15.150> technique<00:04:15.630> and<00:04:15.780> point<00:04:16.019> of

00:04:16.130 --> 00:04:16.140 
better your technique and point of

00:04:16.140 --> 00:04:18.740 
better your technique and point of
contact<00:04:16.709> is<00:04:17.010> the<00:04:17.729> better<00:04:17.940> your<00:04:18.120> timings<00:04:18.540> gonna

00:04:18.740 --> 00:04:18.750 
contact is the better your timings gonna

00:04:18.750 --> 00:04:21.860

this<00:04:30.000> technique<00:04:30.210> quite<00:04:30.750> well<00:04:30.960> and<00:04:31.170> did<00:04:31.290> it

00:04:31.400 --> 00:04:31.410 
this technique quite well and did it

00:04:31.410 --> 00:04:34.670 
this technique quite well and did it
good<00:04:31.590> on<00:04:31.710> the<00:04:31.920> initial<00:04:32.760> swings<00:04:33.030> he<00:04:33.150> had<00:04:33.680> his

good on the initial swings he had his

good on the initial swings he had his
snap<00:04:34.980> was<00:04:35.190> decent<00:04:35.670> already<00:04:35.910> too<00:04:36.150> from

00:04:36.379 --> 00:04:36.389 
snap was decent already too from

as we transition the live hitting Pat
showed<00:04:46.740> remarkable<00:04:47.400> improvement<00:04:48.030> well<00:04:48.630> it

00:04:48.710 --> 00:04:48.720 
showed remarkable improvement well it

00:04:48.720 --> 00:04:50.450 
showed remarkable improvement well it
still<00:04:48.990> will<00:04:49.169> take<00:04:49.200> time<00:04:49.710> to<00:04:49.950> develop<00:04:50.070> a

00:04:50.450 --> 00:04:50.460 
still will take time to develop a

00:04:50.460 --> 00:04:53.180 
still will take time to develop a
smoother<00:04:51.060> stride<00:04:51.900> and<00:04:52.169> weight<00:04:52.350> transfer<00:04:52.980> and

00:04:53.180 --> 00:04:53.190 
smoother stride and weight transfer and

00:04:53.190 --> 00:04:55.490 
smoother stride and weight transfer and
that's<00:04:53.820> a<00:04:53.910> better<00:04:54.090> hip<00:04:54.330> rotation<00:04:55.020> he

00:04:55.490 --> 00:04:55.500 
that's a better hip rotation he

00:04:55.500 --> 00:04:57.260 
that's a better hip rotation he
developed<00:04:55.919> an<00:04:56.040> ability<00:04:56.310> to<00:04:56.610> pull<00:04:56.850> the<00:04:57.000> ball

00:04:57.260 --> 00:04:57.270 
developed an ability to pull the ball

00:04:57.270 --> 00:04:59.120 
developed an ability to pull the ball
and<00:04:57.750> he<00:04:57.900> had<00:04:58.020> numerous<00:04:58.260> balls<00:04:58.710> over<00:04:59.040> the

00:05:39.650 --> 00:05:39.660 
any weight transfer not getting much any

00:05:39.660 --> 00:05:41.719 
any weight transfer not getting much any
hip<00:05:40.470> rotation<00:05:41.070> whatsoever

00:05:41.719 --> 00:05:41.729 
hip rotation whatsoever

00:05:41.729 --> 00:05:43.550 
hip rotation whatsoever
everything<00:05:42.300> was<00:05:42.479> all<00:05:42.630> upper<00:05:42.990> half<00:05:43.260> and

00:05:43.550 --> 00:05:43.560 
everything was all upper half and

00:05:43.560 --> 00:05:46.659 
everything was all upper half and
wondered<00:05:44.280> why<00:05:44.430> you<00:05:44.490> know<00:05:44.789> just<00:05:45.060> the<00:05:45.360> the

wondered why you know just the the

00:05:46.669 --> 00:05:48.950 
wondered why you know just the the
consistency<00:05:47.669> wasn't<00:05:48.030> there<00:05:48.270> the<00:05:48.690> power

00:05:48.950 --> 00:05:48.960 
consistency wasn't there the power

00:05:48.960 --> 00:05:51.469 
consistency wasn't there the power
wasn't<00:05:49.320> there<00:05:49.710> but<00:05:50.280> coming<00:05:50.640> out<00:05:50.760> here<00:05:51.060> I<00:05:51.270> mean

00:06:06.560 --> 00:06:06.570 
and I'm a much better hitter just with a

00:06:06.570 --> 00:06:09.350 
and I'm a much better hitter just with a
few<00:06:06.870> days<00:06:06.990> of<00:06:07.200> training<00:06:07.410> so<00:06:07.770> a<00:06:08.280> great<00:06:08.940> job<00:06:09.180> to

00:06:09.350 --> 00:06:09.360 
few days of training so a great job to

00:06:09.360 --> 00:06:11.240

you<00:06:09.390> guys<00:06:09.660> that<00:06:09.870> she<00:06:09.990> won<00:06:10.169> she<00:06:10.200> ate<00:06:10.470> it<00:06:10.620> for<00:06:10.800> you

00:06:11.240 --> 00:06:11.250 
you guys that she won she ate it for you

00:06:11.250 --> 00:06:12.800 
you guys that she won she ate it for you
it<00:06:11.370> becomes<00:06:11.700> it<00:06:12.060> starting<00:06:12.330> to<00:06:12.390> feel<00:06:12.570> natural

00:06:12.800 --> 00:06:12.810 
it becomes it starting to feel natural

00:06:12.810 --> 00:06:14.690 
it becomes it starting to feel natural
and<00:06:13.229> that's<00:06:13.410> what<00:06:13.620> the<00:06:13.740> pros<00:06:13.950> have<00:06:14.190> a<00:06:14.280> natural

00:06:14.690 --> 00:06:14.700 
and that's what the pros have a natural

00:06:14.700 --> 00:06:16.790 
and that's what the pros have a natural
swinging<00:06:15.120> the<00:06:15.570> more<00:06:15.780> natural<00:06:15.930> becomes<00:06:16.560> fear

00:06:16.790 --> 00:06:16.800 
swinging the more natural becomes fear

00:06:16.800 --> 00:06:18.710 
swinging the more natural becomes fear
the<00:06:16.950> more<00:06:17.100> you<00:06:17.190> can<00:06:17.340> just<00:06:17.550> stride<00:06:17.880> and<00:06:18.240> then

00:06:18.710 --> 00:06:18.720 
the more you can just stride and then

00:06:18.720 --> 00:06:20.570 
the more you can just stride and then
just<00:06:18.930> rotate<00:06:19.380> rather<00:06:19.919> than<00:06:20.100> having<00:06:20.220> to<00:06:20.370> think

00:06:20.570 --> 00:06:20.580 
just rotate rather than having to think

00:06:20.580 --> 00:06:22.040 
just rotate rather than having to think
of<00:06:20.669> different<00:06:20.850> steps<00:06:21.270> that<00:06:21.390> is<00:06:21.570> pretty<00:06:21.840> simple

00:06:22.040 --> 00:06:22.050 
of different steps that is pretty simple

00:06:22.050 --> 00:06:23.960 
of different steps that is pretty simple
to<00:06:22.320> think<00:06:22.560> about<00:06:22.770> it<00:06:22.919> it<00:06:23.100> really<00:06:23.130> is<00:06:23.550> it's<00:06:23.760> much

00:06:23.960 --> 00:06:23.970 
to think about it it really is it's much

00:06:23.970 --> 00:06:27.140 
to think about it it really is it's much
more<00:06:24.180> simple<00:06:24.690> than<00:06:24.720> then<00:06:25.710> I<00:06:25.830> realize<00:06:26.250> diet<00:06:26.520> you

00:06:27.140 --> 00:06:27.150 
more simple than then I realize diet you

00:06:27.150 --> 00:06:29.300 
more simple than then I realize diet you
know<00:06:27.270> always<00:06:27.419> it<00:06:27.720> built<00:06:27.990> up<00:06:28.200> I<00:06:28.410> got<00:06:28.680> to<00:06:28.710> do<00:06:28.830> 15

00:06:29.300 --> 00:06:29.310 
know always it built up I got to do 15

00:06:29.310 --> 00:06:31.100 
know always it built up I got to do 15
different<00:06:29.669> things<00:06:29.880> correctly<00:06:30.419> and<00:06:30.750> when

00:06:31.100 --> 00:06:31.110 
different things correctly and when

00:06:31.110 --> 00:06:32.360 
different things correctly and when
you're<00:06:31.260> doing<00:06:31.410> that<00:06:31.560> you're<00:06:31.979> not<00:06:32.160> going<00:06:32.280> to

00:06:32.360 --> 00:06:32.370 
you're doing that you're not going to

00:06:32.370 --> 00:06:34.070 
you're doing that you're not going to
get<00:06:32.490> even<00:06:32.760> one<00:06:32.940> right<00:06:33.240> so<00:06:33.720> if<00:06:33.810> you<00:06:33.930> just

00:06:34.070 --> 00:06:34.080 
get even one right so if you just

00:06:34.080 --> 00:06:36.409 
get even one right so if you just
simplify<00:06:34.680> it<00:06:34.760> concentrate<00:06:35.760> on<00:06:35.909> the<00:06:36.060> one<00:06:36.240> or

00:06:36.409 --> 00:06:36.419 
simplify it concentrate on the one or

00:06:36.419 --> 00:06:38.540 
simplify it concentrate on the one or
two<00:06:36.599> things<00:06:36.860> amazingly<00:06:37.860> the<00:06:38.159> difference

00:06:38.540 --> 00:06:38.550 
two things amazingly the difference

00:06:38.550 --> 00:06:39.350 
two things amazingly the difference
really<00:06:38.940> is

yesterday<00:07:05.909> even<00:07:06.030> without<00:07:06.509> the<00:07:07.050> right

00:07:07.219 --> 00:07:07.229 
yesterday even without the right

00:07:07.229 --> 00:07:09.860 
yesterday even without the right
mechanics<00:07:07.860> amazingly<00:07:08.849> how<00:07:09.300> far<00:07:09.599> they<00:07:09.780> were

00:07:09.860 --> 00:07:09.870 
mechanics amazingly how far they were

00:07:09.870 --> 00:07:11.779 
mechanics amazingly how far they were
going<00:07:10.319> and<00:07:10.860> I<00:07:10.919> think<00:07:11.129> by<00:07:11.250> the<00:07:11.310> end<00:07:11.430> of<00:07:11.699> these

00:07:11.779 --> 00:07:11.789 
going and I think by the end of these

00:07:11.789 --> 00:07:14.689 
going and I think by the end of these
two<00:07:11.849> days<00:07:12.090> working<00:07:12.690> I'm<00:07:13.560> kind<00:07:14.009> of<00:07:14.069> liking<00:07:14.400> this

00:07:14.689 --> 00:07:14.699 
two days working I'm kind of liking this
