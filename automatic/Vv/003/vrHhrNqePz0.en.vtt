right is court says newly released HX

00:00:52.920 --> 00:00:56.840 
right is court says newly released HX
850<00:00:53.550> power<00:00:53.760> supply<00:00:54.149> so<00:00:55.050> it's<00:00:55.980> 950<00:00:56.489> watt<00:00:56.670> power

00:00:56.840 --> 00:00:56.850 
850 power supply so it's 950 watt power

00:00:56.850 --> 00:00:59.240 
850 power supply so it's 950 watt power
supply<00:00:56.910> and<00:00:57.480> it<00:00:58.350> is<00:00:58.500> what<00:00:58.680> I<00:00:58.710> like<00:00:58.859> to<00:00:58.949> call<00:00:58.980> say

00:01:01.160 --> 00:01:01.170 
monitor meaning that some of the cables

00:01:01.170 --> 00:01:02.599 
monitor meaning that some of the cables
already<00:01:01.289> connected<00:01:01.829> but<00:01:02.129> they're<00:01:02.250> ones<00:01:02.430> that

00:01:02.599 --> 00:01:02.609 
already connected but they're ones that

00:01:02.609 --> 00:01:03.740 
already connected but they're ones that
you're<00:01:02.699> going<00:01:02.820> to<00:01:02.850> be<00:01:02.940> using<00:01:03.059> anyway

00:01:03.740 --> 00:01:03.750 
you're going to be using anyway

00:01:03.750 --> 00:01:06.890 
you're going to be using anyway
um<00:01:03.890> it's<00:01:04.890> also<00:01:05.070> got<00:01:05.850> gold<00:01:06.090> efficiency<00:01:06.659> and

00:01:06.890 --> 00:01:06.900 
um it's also got gold efficiency and

00:01:06.900 --> 00:01:08.450 
um it's also got gold efficiency and
it's<00:01:07.020> low<00:01:07.140> noise<00:01:07.350> so<00:01:07.830> it<00:01:07.920> really<00:01:08.070> is<00:01:08.220> a<00:01:08.250> good

00:01:08.450 --> 00:01:08.460 
it's low noise so it really is a good
