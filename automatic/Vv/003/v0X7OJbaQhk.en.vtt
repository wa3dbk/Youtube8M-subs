 at this rate 

00:00:06.610 --> 00:00:08.209
 according to m 

00:00:08.209 --> 00:00:09.989
 the Koran the Muslims 

00:00:09.989 --> 00:00:12.449
 a community 

00:00:12.449 --> 00:00:15.489
 more than a place of transmission of know-how unique in the world 

00:00:17.939 --> 00:00:21.129
 of a generation from the same source at the same time parliament 

00:00:24.890 --> 00:00:28.279
 that's it 

00:00:28.279 --> 00:00:29.829
 at this stage 

00:00:29.829 --> 00:00:33.240
 that's the sport 

00:00:33.240 --> 00:00:36.240
 these conditions to know what we want 

00:00:38.620 --> 00:00:41.660
 slight decline in recent months 

00:00:41.660 --> 00:00:43.040
 we do not know anything 

00:00:43.040 --> 00:00:46.040
 daily except 

00:00:47.110 --> 00:00:50.190
 beautiful people because it will be soon 

00:00:50.190 --> 00:00:52.020
 it's also important 

00:00:52.020 --> 00:00:54.850
 that I had to take 

00:00:54.850 --> 00:00:58.030
 young people in recent years 

00:00:58.030 --> 00:00:59.560
 however, this 

00:00:59.560 --> 00:01:04.530
 to think about what an artist can do worse than that 

00:01:04.530 --> 00:01:07.530
 gendron 

00:01:08.250 --> 00:01:11.250
 he could not win 

00:01:12.670 --> 00:01:16.110
 under the direction of the artist we can do it 

00:01:16.110 --> 00:01:20.020
 the artist in their wake is also a whole artist of vocal commands 

00:01:22.100 --> 00:01:25.250
 let it be said what decisions to make 

00:01:25.250 --> 00:01:26.860
 I do not decide 

00:01:26.860 --> 00:01:30.170
 Besides, I understood 

00:01:30.170 --> 00:01:32.910
 other artists from here 

00:01:32.910 --> 00:01:35.910
 the latter goes to the bar 

00:01:38.080 --> 00:01:39.040
 to see him 

00:01:39.040 --> 00:01:41.200
 today strong term 

00:01:41.200 --> 00:01:42.960
 a stab 

00:01:42.960 --> 00:01:44.660
 the employment front 

00:01:44.660 --> 00:01:46.260
 about his revenge 

00:01:46.260 --> 00:01:49.370
 first the record is funny steenvoorde 

00:01:49.370 --> 00:01:52.570
 the city decides to participate in play-offs 

00:01:52.570 --> 00:01:55.010
 unfilled psychiatrists 

00:01:55.010 --> 00:01:57.280
 who says what you do 

00:01:57.280 --> 00:02:01.510
 so why not part of our members an individual in larger drop 

00:02:02.800 --> 00:02:06.440
 for once the civilians does not know yet when this decision 

00:02:07.860 --> 00:02:10.860
 after the public stop 

00:02:11.939 --> 00:02:15.249
 The head of state 

00:02:15.249 --> 00:02:16.809
 honor promotion 

00:02:16.809 --> 00:02:18.749
 if we take the goal 

00:02:18.749 --> 00:02:20.369
 Friday night 

00:02:20.369 --> 00:02:23.369
 it's part of the species both parties this season 

00:02:25.759 --> 00:02:28.369
 the second part is it 

00:02:28.369 --> 00:02:31.369
 she mentions 

00:02:32.769 --> 00:02:36.229
 I decide 6,600 mobile homes position 

00:02:36.229 --> 00:02:40.069
 and this behavioral difference in the history of clothing 

00:02:40.879 --> 00:02:43.469
 for its part the strong book 

00:02:43.469 --> 00:02:46.530
 karine dupray out of his goal in the game 

00:02:48.179 --> 00:02:50.129
 edition of his competition 

00:02:50.129 --> 00:02:53.569
 for christian demuynck ump himself launched 

00:02:53.569 --> 00:02:55.989
 it is the most difficult 

00:02:55.989 --> 00:02:59.249
 these services 

00:02:59.249 --> 00:03:00.369
 these rooms 

00:03:00.369 --> 00:03:02.609
 6 

00:03:02.609 --> 00:03:05.289
 indeed the rise 

00:03:05.289 --> 00:03:08.289
 somehow 

00:03:08.809 --> 00:03:11.089
 functionality 

00:03:11.089 --> 00:03:12.209
 the poor Lille 

00:03:12.209 --> 00:03:14.029
 in his document 

00:03:14.029 --> 00:03:15.859
 arenas we have nothing 

00:03:15.859 --> 00:03:18.719
 unlike the previous ones 

00:03:18.719 --> 00:03:21.719
 you did see 

00:03:24.539 --> 00:03:27.289
 this is the fourth criterion 

00:03:27.289 --> 00:03:30.289
 these testimonies collected by AFP 

00:03:36.349 --> 00:03:39.529
 hunt 

00:03:39.529 --> 00:03:42.529
 this is the first time that you think 

00:03:43.959 --> 00:03:45.310
 the ldj 

00:03:45.310 --> 00:03:47.549
 since we can define 

00:03:47.549 --> 00:03:50.549
 tentatively 

00:03:52.039 --> 00:03:55.529
 some sectors of activity including gbagbo 

00:03:55.529 --> 00:03:57.019
 Clarke side 

00:03:57.019 --> 00:04:00.019
 if in the image of their disability 

00:04:02.709 --> 00:04:04.519
 too often on a minimum 

00:04:04.519 --> 00:04:07.979
 the motto of the station 

00:04:07.979 --> 00:04:10.979
 citroen c4 

00:04:12.299 --> 00:04:14.519
 I imagine 

00:04:14.519 --> 00:04:17.519
 even if he is not the subject of one of his books 

00:04:18.239 --> 00:04:20.840
 because of some authors coming out 

00:04:20.840 --> 00:04:24.180
 this look at the trial 

00:04:24.180 --> 00:04:28.380
 to preserve the island of Hamilton uses the group of friends 

00:04:29.039 --> 00:04:31.520
 it's impossible 

00:04:31.520 --> 00:04:33.059
 david cameron 

00:04:33.059 --> 00:04:36.059
 in the united states in particular 

00:04:37.370 --> 00:04:39.559
 it is clear that for you 

00:04:39.559 --> 00:04:42.559
 because the same place judgment at the wrong time 

00:04:45.360 --> 00:04:48.629
 your object far away in space 

00:04:48.629 --> 00:04:51.999
 an industrial object consisting of thales google services cn bomber 

00:04:54.120 --> 00:04:55.949
 they have indeed lost 

00:04:55.949 --> 00:04:58.289
 the stores I just mentioned 

00:04:58.289 --> 00:05:01.629
 the image is decisive who does not know what they want to save their school 

00:05:03.059 --> 00:05:08.199
 it's an annual basis the other with August 3 in the science journal 

00:05:08.199 --> 00:05:12.009
 a second edition of the swimming pool lounge of the hotel de la marine 

00:05:12.009 --> 00:05:15.009
 German 

00:05:15.550 --> 00:05:18.240
 for the gloomy economy 

00:05:18.240 --> 00:05:21.240
 we clearly see 

00:05:23.349 --> 00:05:26.349
 because the twins 500 students 

00:05:27.719 --> 00:05:29.529
 true 

00:05:29.529 --> 00:05:32.749
 01 22 

00:05:32.749 --> 00:05:35.599
 but precisely what changed the situation when 

00:05:35.599 --> 00:05:39.080
 it was only black humor 

00:05:39.080 --> 00:05:42.080
 his decisive pass deemed too short 

00:05:43.159 --> 00:05:45.770
 the fact that m 

00:05:45.770 --> 00:05:49.120
 his party 16 

00:05:49.120 --> 00:05:50.490
 however the values 

00:05:50.490 --> 00:05:53.490
 marble 

00:05:55.479 --> 00:05:59.569
 Cielo had no money in the folder asking to break these links 

00:06:00.729 --> 00:06:03.580
 we act as if they had the dollar 

00:06:03.580 --> 00:06:04.680
 but at the same time 

00:06:04.680 --> 00:06:07.680
 the whole of the sultan 

00:06:11.369 --> 00:06:12.409
