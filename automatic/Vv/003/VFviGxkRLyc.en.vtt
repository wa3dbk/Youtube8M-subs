 the train was immobilized the passengers from the back part of the train 

00:00:26.819 --> 00:00:29.779
 are obliged to descend on the track leading to the point of joining the 

00:00:29.779 --> 00:00:30.779
 the station 

00:00:30.779 --> 00:00:33.530
 the best friend to energize on this way there 

00:00:33.530 --> 00:00:36.530

00:00:42.350 --> 00:00:45.160
 median and make us win this couch 

00:00:45.160 --> 00:00:48.530

 a room the driver had not done it better than expected like that 

00:01:02.490 --> 00:01:06.560

00:01:06.560 --> 00:01:08.920
 hundreds of travelers walking on the way 

00:01:08.920 --> 00:01:10.450

 everything was calm it was nice we had a good day 

00:01:16.390 --> 00:01:19.880
 and that's where I saw the train come in front 

00:01:19.880 --> 00:01:21.820
 arriving in the opposite direction 

00:01:21.820 --> 00:01:24.470

 the storage they will get away without damage 

00:01:37.850 --> 00:01:39.850

00:01:57.119 --> 00:02:00.790
 the orientation of the rails visibility on the track and a hundred meters 

00:02:00.789 --> 00:02:04.890
