about what they've been up to and we're
going<00:00:33.600> to<00:00:33.660> just<00:00:34.200> take<00:00:34.320> a<00:00:34.380> look<00:00:34.590> around<00:00:34.680> and<00:00:34.980> see

00:00:35.150 --> 00:00:35.160 
going to just take a look around and see

00:00:35.160 --> 00:00:37.190 
going to just take a look around and see
exactly<00:00:35.250> what<00:00:35.790> it<00:00:35.910> takes<00:00:36.149> to<00:00:36.480> make<00:00:36.690> it<00:00:36.719> to<00:00:37.170> a

work to do become a big deal correct me

00:00:44.010 --> 00:00:45.500 
work to do become a big deal correct me
if<00:00:44.100> I'm<00:00:44.250> wrong<00:00:44.280> this<00:00:44.910> is<00:00:45.030> what<00:00:45.149> I<00:00:45.210> think<00:00:45.420> your

project

00:00:46.900 --> 00:00:46.910 
project

00:00:46.910 --> 00:00:51.250 
project
in<00:00:47.329> my<00:00:47.540> front<00:00:47.890> place<00:00:48.890> the<00:00:49.220> hands<00:00:49.430> can<00:00:49.880> come<00:00:50.260> to

00:00:51.250 --> 00:00:51.260 
in my front place the hands can come to

00:00:51.260 --> 00:00:53.830 
in my front place the hands can come to
just<00:00:51.440> have<00:00:51.590> a<00:00:51.620> wander<00:00:52.130> around<00:00:52.600> well<00:00:53.600> this<00:00:53.809> is

00:00:53.830 --> 00:00:53.840 
just have a wander around well this is

00:00:53.840 --> 00:00:56.170 
just have a wander around well this is
based<00:00:54.230> on<00:00:54.350> my<00:00:54.470> project<00:00:54.920> and<00:00:55.250> I<00:00:55.640> worked<00:00:55.880> on<00:00:56.000> it

00:00:56.170 --> 00:00:56.180 
based on my project and I worked on it

00:00:56.180 --> 00:00:57.940 
based on my project and I worked on it
over<00:00:56.420> the<00:00:56.450> summer<00:00:56.720> a<00:00:57.020> bit<00:00:57.379> about<00:00:57.620> gene

00:00:57.940 --> 00:00:57.950 
over the summer a bit about gene

00:00:57.950 --> 00:01:01.119 
over the summer a bit about gene
delivery<00:00:58.190> gene<00:00:59.090> delivery<00:00:59.450> yeah<00:00:59.989> now<00:01:00.680> I<00:01:00.710> find

00:01:01.119 --> 00:01:01.129 
delivery gene delivery yeah now I find

00:01:01.129 --> 00:01:03.009 
delivery gene delivery yeah now I find
the<00:01:01.190> best<00:01:01.340> thing<00:01:01.580> delivery<00:01:02.120> is<00:01:02.300> from<00:01:02.600> a<00:01:02.750> sauce

00:01:03.009 --> 00:01:03.019 
the best thing delivery is from a sauce

00:01:03.019 --> 00:01:05.530 
the best thing delivery is from a sauce
you<00:01:03.290> order<00:01:03.590> online<00:01:03.680> and<00:01:04.220> get<00:01:04.400> their<00:01:04.550> genes<00:01:04.790> 24

00:01:05.530 --> 00:01:05.540 
you order online and get their genes 24

00:01:05.540 --> 00:01:08.350 
you order online and get their genes 24
hours<00:01:05.780> on<00:01:05.930> times<00:01:06.670> how<00:01:07.670> quick<00:01:07.880> can<00:01:07.910> you<00:01:08.060> deliver

well<00:01:36.920> we<00:01:37.280> have<00:01:37.970> made<00:01:38.150> a<00:01:38.180> wind<00:01:38.480> tunnel<00:01:38.720> actually

00:01:38.950 --> 00:01:38.960 
well we have made a wind tunnel actually

00:01:38.960 --> 00:01:41.290 
well we have made a wind tunnel actually
it<00:01:39.920> took<00:01:40.070> about<00:01:40.220> five<00:01:40.670> months<00:01:40.850> for<00:01:41.180> all

00:01:41.290 --> 00:01:41.300 
it took about five months for all

00:01:41.300 --> 00:01:44.350 
it took about five months for all
together<00:01:41.650> five<00:01:42.650> months<00:01:43.190> yes<00:01:43.310> you<00:01:44.000> must<00:01:44.150> have
