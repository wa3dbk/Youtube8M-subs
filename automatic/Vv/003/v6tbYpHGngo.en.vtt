00:00:00.490 --> 00:00:04.660
 hello everyone how are I bring you a 

00:00:02.800 --> 00:00:06.970
 Christmas makeup video that is this 

00:00:04.660 --> 00:00:09.669
 that I have put in summary are about 

00:00:06.970 --> 00:00:12.290
 Very golden Christmas eyes very 

00:00:09.669 --> 00:00:15.460
 festive and some lips 

00:00:12.290 --> 00:00:17.480
 forced red media produced sprite 

00:00:15.460 --> 00:00:19.340
 I find that it looks very beautiful it is very 

00:00:17.480 --> 00:00:21.260
 favorable and is special for these 

00:00:19.340 --> 00:00:25.720
 Christmas parties and all dinners 

00:00:21.260 --> 00:00:25.720
 Christmas and all the things you have 

00:00:25.970 --> 00:00:30.740
 and that you see the video kisses good 

00:00:29.539 --> 00:00:32.989
 first very easy we are going to use a 

00:00:30.740 --> 00:00:34.699
 golden color eyeliner this already 

00:00:32.989 --> 00:00:36.920
 my favorite and it is very small 

00:00:34.699 --> 00:00:39.450
 favorite golden flame that is the color 

00:00:36.920 --> 00:00:44.610
 golden favorite of ethics 

00:00:39.450 --> 00:00:47.070
 it's worth 1500 or something like that and this does 

00:00:44.610 --> 00:00:48.930
 we are going to align the entire mobile eyelid and 

00:00:47.070 --> 00:00:51.330
 giving a small extension out 

00:00:48.930 --> 00:00:54.360
 as to lengthen the eye a little more and 

00:00:51.330 --> 00:00:55.900
 give an effect more like cats eyes 

00:00:54.360 --> 00:00:59.520
 feline eyes 

00:00:55.900 --> 00:00:59.520
 so let's do that 

00:01:01.040 --> 00:01:05.449
 we are well attached to the tabs for 

00:01:03.680 --> 00:01:08.090
 that there is no blank 

00:01:05.449 --> 00:01:10.450
 that looks skin and we continue painting everything 

00:01:08.090 --> 00:01:10.450
 apart 

00:01:20.570 --> 00:01:26.150
 we see something we like the 

00:01:22.820 --> 00:01:28.190
 way and be more or less even that it is 

00:01:26.150 --> 00:01:30.310
 evenly both eyes let's delineate 

00:01:28.190 --> 00:01:34.310
 also the tabs down here so that 

00:01:30.310 --> 00:01:36.590
 there's a whole transition in the 

00:01:34.310 --> 00:01:38.420
 makeup is all united with the papacy 

00:01:36.590 --> 00:01:40.070
 above and childbirth does not look like a 

00:01:38.420 --> 00:01:43.869
 half weird so let's delineate with the 

00:01:40.070 --> 00:01:43.869
 same success the tabs below 

00:01:48.610 --> 00:01:53.060
 we have our eyes painted so we are 

00:01:51.620 --> 00:01:54.680
 ready you can of course 

00:01:53.060 --> 00:01:56.510
 recreate this look with any color of 

00:01:54.680 --> 00:01:58.280
 eyeliner that you have I chose 

00:01:56.510 --> 00:02:00.650
 this because the gold as a color more 

00:01:58.280 --> 00:02:03.970
 Christmas and apart because I like it a lot 

00:02:00.650 --> 00:02:07.150
 especially it's clear because 

00:02:03.970 --> 00:02:10.060
 with light I do not know if you can see the 

00:02:07.150 --> 00:02:12.430
 lighting shadows is just the same 

00:02:10.060 --> 00:02:15.160
 pencil itself because it has a medium effect 

00:02:12.430 --> 00:02:17.980
 metallized then we do not have to be 

00:02:15.160 --> 00:02:20.080
 adding a color to light up another 

00:02:17.980 --> 00:02:22.810
 to darken more mouth out because the 

00:02:20.080 --> 00:02:24.940
 pencil only place then once that 

00:02:22.810 --> 00:02:26.440
 we have this let's blur the 

00:02:24.940 --> 00:02:28.960
 edges a bit so you do not see the 

00:02:26.440 --> 00:02:31.720
 pencil stroke so long satan so 

00:02:28.960 --> 00:02:35.280
 long so strong and up we're going to 

00:02:31.720 --> 00:02:38.340
 do with a brush 

00:02:35.280 --> 00:02:39.420
 like this and below you can also 

00:02:38.340 --> 00:02:40.620
 do with a brush but I'm going to 

00:02:39.420 --> 00:02:42.680
 do with a cotton milestone because it 's a lot 

00:02:40.620 --> 00:02:45.120
 easier and it does it much faster 

00:02:42.680 --> 00:02:46.770
 then with milestones with a 

00:02:45.120 --> 00:02:48.350
 I do not know how to stick at all 

00:02:46.770 --> 00:02:51.569
 countries saying 13 fifth so good 

00:02:48.350 --> 00:02:53.040
 they take it and they just have it 

00:02:51.569 --> 00:02:56.750
 by 

00:02:53.040 --> 00:02:56.750
 the edge of the eyeliner 

00:02:59.510 --> 00:03:05.849
 and that will fade 

00:03:03.010 --> 00:03:05.849
 very softly 

00:03:11.430 --> 00:03:15.629
 step to take a shade of golden color 

00:03:13.319 --> 00:03:18.980
 and we will apply it in the area here 

00:03:15.629 --> 00:03:22.019
 inner tear and up to half 

00:03:18.980 --> 00:03:26.870
 inner lower eyelid 

00:03:22.019 --> 00:03:29.930
 I'm going to use this tyson color 

00:03:26.870 --> 00:03:34.870
 what is a trio called 63 o'clock 

00:03:29.930 --> 00:03:34.870
 shadows for three and the color is gold and 

00:03:35.010 --> 00:03:42.140
 and it is this pure golden color very Christmas 

00:03:38.580 --> 00:03:42.140
 and I'm going to apply it with the same 

00:03:56.260 --> 00:04:00.970
 and finally we are going to take shadows that 

00:03:58.269 --> 00:04:02.590
 are matte color in this case I will 

00:04:00.970 --> 00:04:04.269
 use the shadows that I showed also in 

00:04:02.590 --> 00:04:05.799
 the previous video that are these shadows 

00:04:04.269 --> 00:04:08.930
 of kid that I like a lot because they are 

00:04:05.799 --> 00:04:12.620
 you kill and I like to illuminate 

00:04:08.930 --> 00:04:14.750
 eyebrows with matte colors so that the 

00:04:12.620 --> 00:04:17.209
 picture does not look so weird I'm going to use the 

00:04:14.750 --> 00:04:19.549
 yellow color that like a yellow 

00:04:17.209 --> 00:04:22.430
 little duck that dares bone that has the palette 

00:04:19.549 --> 00:04:26.259
 and I'm going to apply it in this area below 

00:04:22.430 --> 00:04:26.259
 eyebrow with a sponge too 

00:04:26.730 --> 00:04:30.420
 because I want it to stand out more than anything 

00:04:28.620 --> 00:04:32.760
 gold eyeliner and golden 

00:04:30.420 --> 00:04:34.470
 We put inside the eye 

00:04:32.760 --> 00:04:36.060
 because obviously if you're not in a 

00:04:34.470 --> 00:04:38.490
 Christmas dinner or something like that they are going to take 

00:04:36.060 --> 00:04:40.290
 photos so we want it to look good 

00:04:38.490 --> 00:04:41.970
 then they had ready and now we're going 

00:04:40.290 --> 00:04:44.580
 apply eyelash mask and / or gloss 

00:04:41.970 --> 00:04:46.529
 volume already you see there are in the 

00:04:44.580 --> 00:04:50.839
 black color 

00:04:46.529 --> 00:04:50.839
 and we apply a lot of mascara 

00:04:54.520 --> 00:04:57.580
 there we have one with the tab mark 

00:04:56.379 --> 00:04:59.050
 and I recommend you use a mask 

00:04:57.580 --> 00:05:01.380
 waterproof tab so that during 

00:04:59.050 --> 00:05:03.300
 the night do not run away 

00:05:01.380 --> 00:05:05.160
 and they are melting under the eye 

00:05:03.300 --> 00:05:07.710
 once we have our eyes ready let's go 

00:05:05.160 --> 00:05:10.460
 to move to the blush in this case I will 

00:05:07.710 --> 00:05:11.960
 make a pink robot 

00:05:10.460 --> 00:05:13.370
 is one that already shows a previous video 

00:05:11.960 --> 00:05:17.590
 is one of big pamela in color 

00:05:13.370 --> 00:05:20.110
 soft pink that a pink color 

00:05:17.590 --> 00:05:22.180
 very soft especially because I am 

00:05:20.110 --> 00:05:24.580
 blanquita then we are going to chop it with 

00:05:22.180 --> 00:05:27.490
 a brochita let's smile a little and 

00:05:24.580 --> 00:05:29.360
 let's find the little bit and we're going to 

00:05:27.490 --> 00:05:31.460
 Apply 

00:05:29.360 --> 00:05:33.379
 and we're going to expose just a little bit towards 

00:05:31.460 --> 00:05:37.610
 back and finally the lips as is 

00:05:33.379 --> 00:05:40.729
 a happy holiday festive season 

00:05:37.610 --> 00:05:45.439
 parties and all the things I'm going to use a 

00:05:40.729 --> 00:05:47.380
 pencil a pencil a red lipstick this color 

00:05:45.439 --> 00:05:51.130
 it's lemon 

00:05:47.380 --> 00:05:52.450
 in the color 24 passion I do not know what online 

00:05:51.130 --> 00:05:55.840
 with wax I have no idea because they have 

00:05:52.450 --> 00:05:58.410
 like a thousand and this color is like this is a red 

00:05:55.840 --> 00:06:01.870
 pulling with closing pulling as for 

00:05:58.410 --> 00:06:04.630
 pink green or something like that a very color 

00:06:01.870 --> 00:06:06.310
 Pretty creamy and very moisturizing 

00:06:04.630 --> 00:06:09.130
 In any case they can also apply 

00:06:06.310 --> 00:06:11.050
 some layer balm to hydrate the 

00:06:09.130 --> 00:06:13.060
 lips beforehand and with this is 

00:06:11.050 --> 00:06:15.790
 you have to be very careful because we can 

00:06:13.060 --> 00:06:20.070
 leave the muddy 

00:06:15.790 --> 00:06:20.070
 and then we are going to apply life 

00:06:31.550 --> 00:06:34.940
 I do not like it, even though it has 

00:06:32.750 --> 00:06:37.250
 a little weird with a little square 

00:06:34.940 --> 00:06:40.790
 and there would be ready the makeup I see 

00:06:37.250 --> 00:06:43.700
 whiter than ever so it looks very 

00:06:40.790 --> 00:06:45.680
 nice to be very festive very Christmas and 

00:06:43.700 --> 00:06:47.810

00:06:45.680 --> 00:06:50.030
