00:03:06.559 --> 00:03:06.569 
core concepts to what we do and it's

00:03:06.569 --> 00:03:08.240 
core concepts to what we do and it's
good<00:03:06.840> to<00:03:07.079> know<00:03:07.260> that<00:03:07.290> when<00:03:07.680> you're<00:03:07.799> hiring<00:03:08.010> a

00:03:08.240 --> 00:03:08.250 
good to know that when you're hiring a

00:03:08.250 --> 00:03:10.250 
good to know that when you're hiring a
tick<00:03:08.489> and<00:03:08.670> sold<00:03:08.879> or<00:03:09.090> a<00:03:09.120> new<00:03:09.269> employee<00:03:09.420> that

00:03:10.250 --> 00:03:10.260 
tick and sold or a new employee that

00:03:10.260 --> 00:03:11.720 
tick and sold or a new employee that
they<00:03:10.409> at<00:03:10.530> least<00:03:10.650> have<00:03:10.920> this<00:03:11.129> basic<00:03:11.340> knowledge

00:03:11.720 --> 00:03:11.730 
they at least have this basic knowledge

00:03:11.730 --> 00:03:14.870 
they at least have this basic knowledge
and<00:03:12.690> this<00:03:13.500> so<00:03:13.680> this<00:03:13.859> will<00:03:14.010> help<00:03:14.130> people<00:03:14.639> hiring

00:03:14.870 --> 00:03:14.880 
and this so this will help people hiring

00:03:14.880 --> 00:03:16.670 
and this so this will help people hiring
