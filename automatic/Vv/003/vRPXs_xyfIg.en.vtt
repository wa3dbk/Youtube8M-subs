as<00:02:26.400> well<00:02:26.430> so<00:02:27.150> I<00:02:27.690> don't<00:02:27.930> really<00:02:28.020> know<00:02:28.260> I<00:02:28.290> guess

00:02:28.400 --> 00:02:28.410 
as well so I don't really know I guess

00:02:28.410 --> 00:02:30.710 
as well so I don't really know I guess
he<00:02:28.830> just<00:02:28.860> I<00:02:29.490> guess<00:02:29.730> a<00:02:29.850> cure<00:02:30.060> decided<00:02:30.450> he<00:02:30.510> wanted

00:02:30.710 --> 00:02:30.720 
he just I guess a cure decided he wanted

00:02:33.110 --> 00:02:33.120 
to shave cones head again which is kind

00:02:33.120 --> 00:02:34.550 
to shave cones head again which is kind
of<00:02:33.270> I<00:02:33.690> don't<00:02:33.750> know<00:02:33.960> it's<00:02:34.140> just<00:02:34.200> out<00:02:34.410> of<00:02:34.440> the

00:02:34.550 --> 00:02:34.560 
of I don't know it's just out of the

00:02:34.560 --> 00:02:35.960 
of I don't know it's just out of the
blue<00:02:34.590> like<00:02:35.010> because<00:02:35.250> Crillon<00:02:35.550> really<00:02:35.730> isn't<00:02:35.940> a

00:02:35.960 --> 00:02:35.970 
blue like because Crillon really isn't a

00:02:35.970 --> 00:02:38.120 
blue like because Crillon really isn't a
character<00:02:36.270> that<00:02:36.410> that<00:02:37.410> makes<00:02:37.650> a<00:02:37.770> lot<00:02:37.890> of<00:02:37.950> an

00:02:38.120 --> 00:02:38.130 
character that that makes a lot of an

00:02:38.130 --> 00:02:39.740 
character that that makes a lot of an
impact<00:02:38.460> in<00:02:38.640> a<00:02:38.700> lot<00:02:38.820> of<00:02:38.850> the<00:02:38.970> DVD<00:02:39.270> movies<00:02:39.600> now

00:02:39.740 --> 00:02:39.750 
impact in a lot of the DVD movies now

00:02:39.750 --> 00:02:41.900 
impact in a lot of the DVD movies now
because<00:02:40.290> like<00:02:40.440> everybody<00:02:41.340> they're<00:02:41.490> fighting

00:02:41.900 --> 00:02:41.910 
because like everybody they're fighting

00:02:41.910 --> 00:02:44.780 
because like everybody they're fighting
is<00:02:42.000> either<00:02:42.120> like<00:02:42.420> god<00:02:42.930> tier<00:02:43.290> or<00:02:43.320> is<00:02:43.860> a<00:02:43.920> god<00:02:44.430> so

00:02:44.780 --> 00:02:44.790 
is either like god tier or is a god so

00:02:44.790 --> 00:02:46.490 
is either like god tier or is a god so
really<00:02:45.330> Crillon<00:02:45.630> doesn't<00:02:45.870> do<00:02:45.930> a<00:02:45.960> lot<00:02:46.050> beside

00:02:46.490 --> 00:02:46.500 
really Crillon doesn't do a lot beside

00:02:46.500 --> 00:02:47.720 
really Crillon doesn't do a lot beside
its<00:02:46.650> comical<00:02:47.040> leaf<00:02:47.220> so<00:02:47.460> I<00:02:47.490> don't<00:02:47.700> really

00:02:47.720 --> 00:02:47.730 
its comical leaf so I don't really

00:02:47.730 --> 00:02:49.760 
its comical leaf so I don't really
understand<00:02:48.180> why<00:02:48.300> they're<00:02:48.450> changing<00:02:49.350> Crillon

00:02:49.760 --> 00:02:49.770 
understand why they're changing Crillon

00:02:49.770 --> 00:02:51.170 
understand why they're changing Crillon
because<00:02:50.040> Crillon<00:02:50.550> doesn't<00:02:50.790> need<00:02:50.880> change

00:02:51.170 --> 00:02:51.180 
because Crillon doesn't need change

00:02:51.180 --> 00:02:52.700 
because Crillon doesn't need change
really<00:02:51.750> I<00:02:51.780> don't<00:02:52.020> think<00:02:52.200> he<00:02:52.290> needs<00:02:52.470> change

00:02:52.700 --> 00:02:52.710 
really I don't think he needs change

00:02:52.710 --> 00:02:55.070 
really I don't think he needs change
honestly<00:02:53.220> but<00:02:53.850> yeah<00:02:54.390> I<00:02:54.420> really<00:02:54.720> know<00:02:54.870> you<00:02:54.990> guys

00:02:55.880 --> 00:02:55.890 
think about all these new designs

00:02:55.890 --> 00:02:58.640 
think about all these new designs
obviously<00:02:57.080> everybody<00:02:58.080> technically<00:02:58.470> has<00:02:58.620> a

obviously everybody technically has a
new<00:02:58.830> design<00:02:59.130> kind<00:02:59.760> of<00:02:59.910> except<00:03:00.270> for<00:03:00.420> piccolo<00:03:00.810> I

00:03:01.630 --> 00:03:01.640 
new design kind of except for piccolo I

00:03:01.640 --> 00:03:05.540 
new design kind of except for piccolo I
just<00:03:02.640> although<00:03:03.240> I<00:03:03.600> would<00:03:03.990> say<00:03:04.280> it's<00:03:05.280> not

00:03:05.540 --> 00:03:05.550 
just although I would say it's not

00:03:05.550 --> 00:03:06.710 
just although I would say it's not
really<00:03:05.820> like<00:03:05.970> it<00:03:06.090> matters<00:03:06.420> a<00:03:06.450> lot<00:03:06.660> because

00:03:06.710 --> 00:03:06.720 
really like it matters a lot because

00:03:06.720 --> 00:03:08.210 
really like it matters a lot because
Cronin's<00:03:07.380> still<00:03:07.590> gonna<00:03:07.680> be<00:03:07.830> wearing<00:03:08.010> the

00:03:08.210 --> 00:03:08.220 
Cronin's still gonna be wearing the

00:03:08.220 --> 00:03:11.240 
Cronin's still gonna be wearing the
orange<00:03:08.960> Gaeta<00:03:09.960> he<00:03:10.140> was<00:03:10.260> wearing<00:03:10.590> back<00:03:11.040> in

00:03:11.240 --> 00:03:11.250 
orange Gaeta he was wearing back in

00:03:11.250 --> 00:03:12.860 
orange Gaeta he was wearing back in
Dragon<00:03:11.520> Ball<00:03:11.550> Z<00:03:11.700> which<00:03:12.180> is<00:03:12.270> funny<00:03:12.450> because<00:03:12.630> you

00:03:12.860 --> 00:03:12.870 
Dragon Ball Z which is funny because you

00:03:12.870 --> 00:03:13.910 
Dragon Ball Z which is funny because you
actually<00:03:12.990> stop<00:03:13.320> wearing<00:03:13.620> that<00:03:13.710> he<00:03:13.800> was

00:03:13.910 --> 00:03:13.920 
actually stop wearing that he was

00:03:13.920 --> 00:03:15.230 
actually stop wearing that he was
actually<00:03:14.040> wearing<00:03:14.340> that<00:03:14.520> watch<00:03:14.700> i<00:03:14.910> guess<00:03:15.120> i

00:03:15.230 --> 00:03:15.240 
actually wearing that watch i guess i

00:03:15.240 --> 00:03:16.910 
actually wearing that watch i guess i
was<00:03:15.360> party<00:03:15.690> clothing<00:03:16.020> since<00:03:16.530> she<00:03:16.620> was<00:03:16.740> going

00:03:16.910 --> 00:03:16.920 
was party clothing since she was going

00:03:16.920 --> 00:03:18.560 
was party clothing since she was going
to<00:03:16.950> blomus<00:03:17.280> party<00:03:17.610> in<00:03:17.760> battle<00:03:18.060> of<00:03:18.150> gods<00:03:18.330> that

00:03:18.560 --> 00:03:18.570 
to blomus party in battle of gods that

00:03:18.570 --> 00:03:20.480 
to blomus party in battle of gods that
new<00:03:19.140> outfit<00:03:19.560> was<00:03:19.680> pretty<00:03:19.920> much<00:03:20.010> probably<00:03:20.220> just

00:03:20.480 --> 00:03:20.490 
new outfit was pretty much probably just

00:03:20.490 --> 00:03:22.850 
new outfit was pretty much probably just
some<00:03:21.210> party<00:03:21.510> attire<00:03:21.750> wasn't<00:03:22.200> really<00:03:22.380> fighting

00:03:22.850 --> 00:03:22.860 
some party attire wasn't really fighting

00:03:22.860 --> 00:03:24.680 
some party attire wasn't really fighting
a<00:03:23.010> tire<00:03:23.190> so<00:03:23.550> he<00:03:23.910> never<00:03:24.060> really<00:03:24.360> technically

00:03:24.680 --> 00:03:24.690 
a tire so he never really technically

00:03:24.690 --> 00:03:26.240 
a tire so he never really technically
stopped<00:03:25.050> wearing<00:03:25.350> this<00:03:25.530> I<00:03:25.680> don't<00:03:25.830> think<00:03:26.010> so

00:03:26.240 --> 00:03:26.250 
stopped wearing this I don't think so

00:03:26.250 --> 00:03:28.130 
stopped wearing this I don't think so
you<00:03:26.700> know<00:03:26.820> except<00:03:27.600> for<00:03:27.630> when<00:03:27.870> he<00:03:27.990> was

00:03:28.130 --> 00:03:28.140 
you know except for when he was

00:03:28.140 --> 00:03:30.050 
you know except for when he was
obviously<00:03:28.560> a<00:03:28.710> family<00:03:29.340> man<00:03:29.520> and<00:03:29.730> wasn't

00:03:30.050 --> 00:03:30.060 
obviously a family man and wasn't

00:03:30.060 --> 00:03:32.270 
obviously a family man and wasn't
fighting<00:03:30.270> anymore<00:03:30.600> so<00:03:31.200> I<00:03:31.500> guess<00:03:31.890> that<00:03:31.920> that's

00:03:32.270 --> 00:03:32.280 
fighting anymore so I guess that that's

00:03:32.280 --> 00:03:35.360 
fighting anymore so I guess that that's
why<00:03:32.940> he's<00:03:33.150> wearing<00:03:33.270> the<00:03:33.480> orange<00:03:33.630> key<00:03:34.370> although

00:03:35.360 --> 00:03:35.370 
why he's wearing the orange key although

00:03:35.370 --> 00:03:36.830 
why he's wearing the orange key although
the<00:03:35.520> bald<00:03:35.730> head<00:03:35.790> I<00:03:36.120> really<00:03:36.540> don't<00:03:36.600> want<00:03:36.780> to

00:03:36.830 --> 00:03:36.840 
the bald head I really don't want to

00:03:36.840 --> 00:03:38.390 
the bald head I really don't want to
understand<00:03:37.260> why<00:03:37.380> they<00:03:37.560> changed<00:03:37.800> that<00:03:38.040> about

00:03:38.390 --> 00:03:38.400 
understand why they changed that about

00:03:38.400 --> 00:03:40.280 
understand why they changed that about
him<00:03:38.580> um<00:03:38.820> instead<00:03:39.450> of<00:03:39.540> him<00:03:39.720> just<00:03:39.870> having<00:03:40.140> hair

00:03:40.280 --> 00:03:40.290 
him um instead of him just having hair

00:03:40.290 --> 00:03:41.540 
him um instead of him just having hair
since<00:03:40.500> you<00:03:40.560> know<00:03:40.710> he<00:03:40.860> had<00:03:40.950> her<00:03:41.100> at<00:03:41.220> the<00:03:41.310> end<00:03:41.430> of

00:03:41.540 --> 00:03:41.550 
since you know he had her at the end of

00:03:41.550 --> 00:03:43.820 
since you know he had her at the end of
DBZ<00:03:42.330> and<00:03:42.600> he<00:03:42.870> also<00:03:43.050> had<00:03:43.260> hair<00:03:43.440> in<00:03:43.500> battle<00:03:43.740> of

00:03:43.820 --> 00:03:43.830 
DBZ and he also had hair in battle of

00:03:43.830 --> 00:03:45.290 
DBZ and he also had hair in battle of
God<00:03:43.980> so<00:03:44.130> I<00:03:44.160> wonder<00:03:44.340> why<00:03:44.430> they<00:03:44.550> decided<00:03:44.700> to<00:03:45.060> cut

00:03:45.290 --> 00:03:45.300 
God so I wonder why they decided to cut

00:03:45.300 --> 00:03:47.330

his<00:03:45.420> hair<00:03:45.630> but<00:03:46.230> you<00:03:46.470> know<00:03:46.590> I<00:03:46.770> don't<00:03:47.010> know<00:03:47.250> what
