00:02:20.840 --> 00:02:20.850 
then with pack you get

00:02:20.850 --> 00:02:23.790 
then with pack you get
three<00:02:21.850> three<00:02:22.630> filters<00:02:22.870> you<00:02:23.320> can<00:02:23.380> actually<00:02:23.530> put

00:02:23.790 --> 00:02:23.800 
three three filters you can actually put

00:02:23.800 --> 00:02:25.710 
three three filters you can actually put
two<00:02:23.980> or<00:02:24.010> three<00:02:24.160> filters<00:02:24.670> or<00:02:24.970> Ionis<00:02:25.540> at<00:02:25.660> the

00:02:25.710 --> 00:02:25.720 
two or three filters or Ionis at the

00:02:25.720 --> 00:02:27.000 
two or three filters or Ionis at the
same<00:02:25.870> time<00:02:26.050> but<00:02:26.260> we'll<00:02:26.470> just<00:02:26.500> do<00:02:26.800> it<00:02:26.830> with<00:02:26.980> one

00:02:27.000 --> 00:02:27.010 
same time but we'll just do it with one

00:02:27.010 --> 00:02:29.550 
same time but we'll just do it with one
and<00:02:27.340> each<00:02:28.240> filter<00:02:28.720> comes<00:02:28.990> in<00:02:29.110> its<00:02:29.230> nice<00:02:29.350> little

00:02:29.550 --> 00:02:29.560 
and each filter comes in its nice little

00:02:29.560 --> 00:02:31.530 
and each filter comes in its nice little
pouch<00:02:29.710> and<00:02:29.980> it<00:02:30.640> shall<00:02:30.790> ways<00:02:30.910> really<00:02:30.970> hold<00:02:31.450> it

00:02:31.530 --> 00:02:31.540 
pouch and it shall ways really hold it

00:02:31.540 --> 00:02:33.150 
pouch and it shall ways really hold it
by<00:02:31.630> the<00:02:31.690> very<00:02:31.870> edge<00:02:31.960> and<00:02:32.200> there<00:02:32.710> you<00:02:32.800> can<00:02:32.950> see

00:02:33.150 --> 00:02:33.160 
by the very edge and there you can see

00:02:33.160 --> 00:02:36.060 
by the very edge and there you can see
this<00:02:33.370> is<00:02:33.490> a<00:02:33.520> neutral<00:02:34.090> density<00:02:35.070> graduated

00:02:36.060 --> 00:02:36.070 
this is a neutral density graduated

00:02:36.070 --> 00:02:37.830 
this is a neutral density graduated
filters<00:02:36.640> that<00:02:36.850> means<00:02:37.060> it's<00:02:37.450> not<00:02:37.600> got<00:02:37.720> any

00:02:37.830 --> 00:02:37.840 
filters that means it's not got any

00:02:37.840 --> 00:02:39.690 
filters that means it's not got any
colors<00:02:38.200> to<00:02:38.410> it<00:02:38.500> it's<00:02:38.620> just<00:02:38.680> kind<00:02:38.800> of<00:02:38.980> gray<00:02:39.310> then

00:02:39.690 --> 00:02:39.700 
colors to it it's just kind of gray then

00:02:39.700 --> 00:02:42.120 
colors to it it's just kind of gray then
clear<00:02:40.150> and<00:02:40.360> from<00:02:40.780> the<00:02:40.870> top<00:02:41.080> it's<00:02:41.350> dark<00:02:41.800> and

00:02:42.120 --> 00:02:42.130 
clear and from the top it's dark and

00:02:42.130 --> 00:02:45.420 
clear and from the top it's dark and
bottom<00:02:42.580> it's<00:02:42.760> clear<00:02:43.060> so<00:02:43.870> this<00:02:44.110> is<00:02:44.350> a<00:02:44.800> neutral

00:02:45.420 --> 00:02:45.430 
bottom it's clear so this is a neutral

00:02:45.430 --> 00:02:47.700 
bottom it's clear so this is a neutral
density<00:02:45.460> of<00:02:45.940> four<00:02:46.570> so<00:02:47.170> that<00:02:47.260> means<00:02:47.410> it's<00:02:47.560> I

00:02:47.700 --> 00:02:47.710 
density of four so that means it's I

00:02:47.710 --> 00:02:49.650 
density of four so that means it's I
think<00:02:47.830> it<00:02:48.040> means<00:02:48.220> it's<00:02:48.820> four<00:02:49.210> stops

00:02:49.650 --> 00:02:49.660 
think it means it's four stops

00:02:49.660 --> 00:02:52.290 
think it means it's four stops
difference<00:02:50.190> you<00:02:51.190> also<00:02:51.310> come<00:02:51.730> with<00:02:51.760> one<00:02:52.120> which

00:02:52.290 --> 00:02:52.300 
difference you also come with one which

00:02:52.300 --> 00:02:54.690 
difference you also come with one which
are<00:02:52.510> ND<00:02:53.260> tubes<00:02:53.560> that's<00:02:53.920> wee<00:02:54.040> bit<00:02:54.190> less<00:02:54.400> of<00:02:54.580> a

00:02:54.690 --> 00:02:54.700 
are ND tubes that's wee bit less of a

00:02:54.700 --> 00:02:58.200 
are ND tubes that's wee bit less of a
difference<00:02:55.030> and<00:02:55.950> then<00:02:56.950> the<00:02:57.070> last<00:02:57.280> one<00:02:57.520> is<00:02:57.790> the

00:02:58.200 --> 00:02:58.210 
difference and then the last one is the

00:02:58.210 --> 00:02:59.970 
difference and then the last one is the
really<00:02:58.390> strong<00:02:58.690> one<00:02:58.900> probably<00:02:59.710> the<00:02:59.770> one<00:02:59.860> which

00:02:59.970 --> 00:02:59.980 
really strong one probably the one which

00:02:59.980 --> 00:03:02.490 
really strong one probably the one which
you<00:03:00.100> use<00:03:00.190> most<00:03:00.460> where<00:03:01.090> it's<00:03:01.420> an<00:03:01.570> ND<00:03:01.930> for

00:03:02.490 --> 00:03:02.500 
you use most where it's an ND for

00:03:02.500 --> 00:03:05.160 
you use most where it's an ND for
families<00:03:03.040> about<00:03:03.430> eight<00:03:03.670> eight<00:03:04.180> stops<00:03:04.480> so<00:03:05.110> what

00:03:05.160 --> 00:03:05.170 
families about eight eight stops so what

00:03:05.170 --> 00:03:06.990 
families about eight eight stops so what
was<00:03:05.320> it<00:03:05.410> we<00:03:05.530> use<00:03:05.710> this<00:03:05.890> one<00:03:06.070> always<00:03:06.820> will<00:03:06.910> be

00:03:06.990 --> 00:03:07.000 
was it we use this one always will be

00:03:07.000 --> 00:03:08.490 
was it we use this one always will be
very<00:03:07.180> careful<00:03:07.300> you<00:03:07.480> don't<00:03:07.660> get<00:03:07.840> fingerprints

00:03:08.490 --> 00:03:08.500 
very careful you don't get fingerprints

00:03:08.500 --> 00:03:11.070 
very careful you don't get fingerprints
onyx<00:03:08.740> there's<00:03:08.890> a<00:03:08.920> big<00:03:09.190> bit<00:03:09.580> of<00:03:09.790> plastic<00:03:10.780> it's

00:03:11.070 --> 00:03:11.080 
onyx there's a big bit of plastic it's

00:03:11.080 --> 00:03:13.050 
onyx there's a big bit of plastic it's
not<00:03:11.230> glass<00:03:11.440> its<00:03:11.680> plastic<00:03:12.040> but<00:03:12.220> a<00:03:12.250> very<00:03:12.700> very

00:03:13.050 --> 00:03:13.060 
not glass its plastic but a very very

00:03:13.060 --> 00:03:14.970 
not glass its plastic but a very very
good<00:03:13.810> classic<00:03:14.230> it<00:03:14.320> doesn't<00:03:14.560> distort<00:03:14.860> your

00:03:14.970 --> 00:03:14.980 
good classic it doesn't distort your

00:03:14.980 --> 00:03:17.730 
good classic it doesn't distort your
image<00:03:15.130> in<00:03:15.400> any<00:03:15.520> way<00:03:15.640> and<00:03:15.880> you<00:03:15.910> place<00:03:16.870> it<00:03:17.110> into

00:03:17.730 --> 00:03:17.740 
image in any way and you place it into

00:03:17.740 --> 00:03:24.120 
image in any way and you place it into
the<00:03:18.700> holder<00:03:19.680> like<00:03:20.680> that<00:03:22.260> so<00:03:23.260> now<00:03:23.650> you've<00:03:24.070> got

00:03:24.120 --> 00:03:24.130 
the holder like that so now you've got

00:03:24.130 --> 00:03:26.280 
the holder like that so now you've got
both<00:03:24.610> you<00:03:24.940> can<00:03:25.120> route<00:03:25.420> it<00:03:25.540> that<00:03:25.750> round<00:03:25.990> so<00:03:26.200> if

00:03:26.280 --> 00:03:26.290 
both you can route it that round so if

00:03:26.290 --> 00:03:28.380 
both you can route it that round so if
you're<00:03:26.440> shooting<00:03:26.650> a<00:03:27.070> portrait<00:03:27.700> way<00:03:27.970> if<00:03:28.210> you're

00:03:28.380 --> 00:03:28.390 
you're shooting a portrait way if you're

00:03:28.390 --> 00:03:29.880 
you're shooting a portrait way if you're
shooting<00:03:28.510> landscape<00:03:29.020> way<00:03:29.170> if<00:03:29.410> you<00:03:29.560> have<00:03:29.680> it<00:03:29.770> go

00:03:29.880 --> 00:03:29.890 
shooting landscape way if you have it go

00:03:29.890 --> 00:03:33.450 
shooting landscape way if you have it go
that<00:03:30.070> way<00:03:30.190> and<00:03:30.370> you<00:03:31.000> can<00:03:31.150> decide<00:03:31.480> on<00:03:31.750> where<00:03:32.500> the

00:03:33.450 --> 00:03:33.460 
that way and you can decide on where the

00:03:33.460 --> 00:03:38.640 
that way and you can decide on where the
kind<00:03:34.090> of<00:03:35.070> filter<00:03:36.070> part<00:03:36.370> takes<00:03:37.210> over<00:03:37.900> so<00:03:38.290> near

00:03:38.640 --> 00:03:38.650 
kind of filter part takes over so near

00:03:38.650 --> 00:03:40.830 
kind of filter part takes over so near
the<00:03:38.740> top<00:03:38.890> near<00:03:39.130> the<00:03:39.220> bottom<00:03:39.360> so<00:03:40.360> again<00:03:40.570> if<00:03:40.750> I

00:03:40.830 --> 00:03:40.840 
the top near the bottom so again if I

00:03:40.840 --> 00:03:46.210 
the top near the bottom so again if I
just<00:03:40.930> take<00:03:41.080> a<00:03:41.140> shot<00:03:41.350> of<00:03:42.180> the<00:03:43.180> garden

00:03:46.210 --> 00:03:46.220 

00:03:46.220 --> 00:03:48.220 

so<00:03:46.970> what<00:03:47.150> you<00:03:47.240> see<00:03:47.420> there<00:03:47.450> so<00:03:48.050> there's

00:03:48.220 --> 00:03:48.230 
so what you see there so there's

00:03:48.230 --> 00:03:51.130 
so what you see there so there's
definitely<00:03:48.440> a<00:03:48.830> lot<00:03:48.860> of<00:03:49.250> spots<00:03:49.640> of<00:03:49.910> the<00:03:50.240> Sun

00:03:51.130 --> 00:03:51.140 
definitely a lot of spots of the Sun

00:03:51.140 --> 00:03:54.970 
definitely a lot of spots of the Sun
hissing<00:03:51.890> but<00:03:52.040> this<00:03:52.250> glass<00:03:52.640> my<00:03:53.800> filtered<00:03:54.800> glass

00:03:54.970 --> 00:03:54.980 
hissing but this glass my filtered glass

00:03:54.980 --> 00:03:56.830 
hissing but this glass my filtered glass
and<00:03:55.130> in<00:03:55.220> the<00:03:55.310> lens<00:03:55.550> glass<00:03:55.910> so<00:03:56.360> there's<00:03:56.600> lots<00:03:56.780> of

00:03:56.830 --> 00:03:56.840 
and in the lens glass so there's lots of

00:03:56.840 --> 00:03:58.030 
and in the lens glass so there's lots of
little<00:03:56.900> spots<00:03:57.200> there<00:03:57.440> so<00:03:57.650> you've<00:03:57.800> really<00:03:57.950> got

00:03:58.030 --> 00:03:58.040 
little spots there so you've really got

00:03:58.040 --> 00:04:00.310 
little spots there so you've really got
to<00:03:58.220> be<00:03:58.340> kind<00:03:58.550> of<00:03:58.580> careful<00:03:58.790> where<00:03:59.570> you<00:03:59.870> use<00:04:00.140> it

00:04:00.310 --> 00:04:00.320 
to be kind of careful where you use it

00:04:00.320 --> 00:04:02.500 
to be kind of careful where you use it
but<00:04:00.740> in<00:04:00.920> general<00:04:01.280> it's<00:04:01.670> really<00:04:01.760> given<00:04:02.210> the<00:04:02.270> sky

00:04:02.500 --> 00:04:02.510 
but in general it's really given the sky

00:04:02.510 --> 00:04:04.750 
but in general it's really given the sky
a<00:04:02.540> great<00:04:03.170> look<00:04:03.650> to<00:04:03.680> it<00:04:03.920> and<00:04:04.160> I'll<00:04:04.400> show<00:04:04.550> you<00:04:04.580> if

00:04:04.750 --> 00:04:04.760 
a great look to it and I'll show you if

00:04:04.760 --> 00:04:08.160 
a great look to it and I'll show you if
I<00:04:04.880> if<00:04:05.090> I<00:04:05.210> raise<00:04:05.990> the<00:04:06.020> height<00:04:06.410> of<00:04:07.220> it

00:04:08.160 --> 00:04:08.170 
I if I raise the height of it

00:04:08.170 --> 00:04:11.530 
I if I raise the height of it
see<00:04:09.170> there

00:04:11.530 --> 00:04:11.540 
see there

00:04:11.540 --> 00:04:22.340 
see there
and<00:04:12.319> then<00:04:12.620> you<00:04:12.830> were<00:04:13.099> it

00:04:22.340 --> 00:04:22.350 

00:04:22.350 --> 00:04:24.300 

now<00:04:23.350> there's<00:04:23.530> a<00:04:23.590> bit<00:04:23.710> of<00:04:23.770> danger<00:04:23.889> because

00:04:24.300 --> 00:04:24.310 
now there's a bit of danger because

00:04:24.310 --> 00:04:27.439 
now there's a bit of danger because
sometimes<00:04:24.940> the<00:04:25.360> Sun<00:04:25.900> can<00:04:26.229> reflect<00:04:26.889> off<00:04:27.310> the

00:04:27.439 --> 00:04:27.449 
sometimes the Sun can reflect off the

00:04:27.449 --> 00:04:32.250 
sometimes the Sun can reflect off the
back<00:04:28.449> of<00:04:28.660> this<00:04:28.870> and<00:04:29.139> get<00:04:29.740> into<00:04:30.550> your<00:04:31.169> into<00:04:32.169> your

00:04:32.250 --> 00:04:32.260 
back of this and get into your into your

00:04:32.260 --> 00:04:34.140 
back of this and get into your into your
image<00:04:32.410> especially<00:04:33.250> when<00:04:33.340> you're<00:04:33.460> using<00:04:33.610> super

00:04:34.140 --> 00:04:34.150 
image especially when you're using super

00:04:34.150 --> 00:04:36.420 
image especially when you're using super
wide<00:04:34.419> angle<00:04:34.840> lenses<00:04:35.139> like<00:04:35.290> this<00:04:35.440> one<00:04:35.620> loan<00:04:36.040> 6e

00:04:36.420 --> 00:04:36.430 
wide angle lenses like this one loan 6e

00:04:36.430 --> 00:04:37.950 
wide angle lenses like this one loan 6e
it's<00:04:36.520> not<00:04:36.669> so<00:04:36.820> much<00:04:36.910> of<00:04:36.970> an<00:04:37.150> issue<00:04:37.300> if<00:04:37.630> you're

00:04:37.950 --> 00:04:37.960 
it's not so much of an issue if you're

00:04:37.960 --> 00:04:42.180 
it's not so much of an issue if you're
doing<00:04:38.229> more<00:04:38.470> kind<00:04:39.190> of<00:04:39.250> 18<00:04:39.940> to<00:04:40.770> 50<00:04:41.770> and<00:04:41.949> then

00:04:42.180 --> 00:04:42.190 
doing more kind of 18 to 50 and then

00:04:42.190 --> 00:04:44.370 
doing more kind of 18 to 50 and then
beyond<00:04:42.490> so<00:04:43.270> this<00:04:43.540> time<00:04:43.750> I'll<00:04:43.900> actually<00:04:44.169> shoot

00:04:44.370 --> 00:04:44.380 
beyond so this time I'll actually shoot

00:04:44.380 --> 00:04:47.490 
beyond so this time I'll actually shoot
straight<00:04:44.830> into<00:04:45.130> the<00:04:45.250> Sun<00:04:46.169> cool<00:04:47.169> so<00:04:47.380> that's

00:04:47.490 --> 00:04:47.500 
straight into the Sun cool so that's

00:04:47.500 --> 00:04:50.520 
straight into the Sun cool so that's
giving<00:04:47.889> it<00:04:47.979> a<00:04:48.040> nice<00:04:48.540> dark<00:04:49.540> sky<00:04:49.960> but<00:04:50.290> yet<00:04:50.440> you

00:04:50.520 --> 00:04:50.530 
giving it a nice dark sky but yet you

00:04:50.530 --> 00:04:52.560 
giving it a nice dark sky but yet you
can<00:04:50.680> still<00:04:50.919> see<00:04:51.100> all<00:04:51.130> the<00:04:51.400> garden<00:04:51.760> again<00:04:52.389> I'll

00:04:52.560 --> 00:04:52.570 
can still see all the garden again I'll

00:04:52.570 --> 00:04:56.400 
can still see all the garden again I'll
do<00:04:52.750> it<00:04:52.810> without<00:04:52.900> the<00:04:53.199> actual<00:04:53.380> filter<00:04:55.410> there

00:04:56.400 --> 00:04:56.410 
do it without the actual filter there

00:04:56.410 --> 00:04:58.529 
do it without the actual filter there
you<00:04:56.500> see<00:04:56.680> the<00:04:56.830> sky<00:04:57.130> is<00:04:57.270> still<00:04:58.270> pretty<00:04:58.479> good

00:04:58.529 --> 00:04:58.539 
you see the sky is still pretty good

00:04:58.539 --> 00:04:59.939 
you see the sky is still pretty good
that's<00:04:58.870> partly<00:04:59.289> to<00:04:59.410> do<00:04:59.500> with<00:04:59.530> the<00:04:59.710> fact<00:04:59.889> that

00:04:59.939 --> 00:04:59.949 
that's partly to do with the fact that

00:04:59.949 --> 00:05:02.520 
that's partly to do with the fact that
this<00:05:00.100> is<00:05:00.340> the<00:05:00.580> Fuji<00:05:01.330> s5<00:05:01.840> it's<00:05:02.020> got<00:05:02.199> a<00:05:02.229> huge

00:05:02.520 --> 00:05:02.530 
this is the Fuji s5 it's got a huge

00:05:02.530 --> 00:05:04.890 
this is the Fuji s5 it's got a huge
dynamic<00:05:02.770> range<00:05:03.190> and<00:05:03.370> but<00:05:04.270> normally<00:05:04.600> the<00:05:04.690> sky

00:05:04.890 --> 00:05:04.900 
dynamic range and but normally the sky

00:05:04.900 --> 00:05:06.840 
dynamic range and but normally the sky
would<00:05:05.080> be<00:05:05.110> a<00:05:05.169> lot<00:05:05.470> more<00:05:05.710> kind<00:05:05.830> of<00:05:05.949> blown<00:05:06.610> out

00:05:06.840 --> 00:05:06.850 
would be a lot more kind of blown out

00:05:06.850 --> 00:05:09.840 
would be a lot more kind of blown out
but<00:05:07.210> imagine<00:05:07.630> bit<00:05:08.320> less<00:05:08.620> dramatic<00:05:08.979> so<00:05:09.580> in<00:05:09.699> if

00:05:09.840 --> 00:05:09.850 
but imagine bit less dramatic so in if

00:05:09.850 --> 00:05:11.340 
but imagine bit less dramatic so in if
you<00:05:09.940> look<00:05:10.060> in<00:05:10.180> the<00:05:10.270> old<00:05:10.389> or<00:05:10.720> the<00:05:11.020> picture<00:05:11.260> with

00:05:11.340 --> 00:05:11.350 
you look in the old or the picture with

00:05:11.350 --> 00:05:13.140 
you look in the old or the picture with
the<00:05:11.440> filter<00:05:11.770> gardens<00:05:12.400> a<00:05:12.490> bit<00:05:12.610> brighter<00:05:12.880> the

00:05:13.140 --> 00:05:13.150 
the filter gardens a bit brighter the

00:05:13.150 --> 00:05:14.909 
the filter gardens a bit brighter the
grass<00:05:13.330> is<00:05:13.510> a<00:05:13.539> bit<00:05:13.660> more<00:05:13.840> greener<00:05:14.110> than<00:05:14.560> the<00:05:14.620> one

00:05:14.909 --> 00:05:14.919 
grass is a bit more greener than the one

00:05:14.919 --> 00:05:16.439 
grass is a bit more greener than the one
without<00:05:15.130> the<00:05:15.190> filter<00:05:15.520> it's<00:05:16.030> kind<00:05:16.210> of<00:05:16.240> a<00:05:16.300> bit

00:05:16.439 --> 00:05:16.449 
without the filter it's kind of a bit

00:05:16.449 --> 00:05:19.170 
without the filter it's kind of a bit
more<00:05:16.479> neutral<00:05:17.440> not<00:05:17.740> as<00:05:17.830> interesting<00:05:18.310> so<00:05:18.669> I'm<00:05:19.120> a

00:05:19.170 --> 00:05:19.180 
more neutral not as interesting so I'm a

00:05:19.180 --> 00:05:20.670 
more neutral not as interesting so I'm a
big<00:05:19.479> fan<00:05:19.750> of<00:05:19.780> these<00:05:19.990> and<00:05:20.199> especially<00:05:20.410> if

00:05:20.670 --> 00:05:20.680 
big fan of these and especially if

00:05:20.680 --> 00:05:21.960 
big fan of these and especially if
you've<00:05:20.800> got<00:05:20.830> it<00:05:21.100> on<00:05:21.220> bright<00:05:21.460> days<00:05:21.490> like<00:05:21.820> this

00:05:21.960 --> 00:05:21.970 
you've got it on bright days like this

00:05:21.970 --> 00:05:24.390 
you've got it on bright days like this
it<00:05:22.270> can<00:05:22.690> really<00:05:22.870> do<00:05:23.110> wonders<00:05:23.410> can<00:05:24.100> be<00:05:24.250> some

00:05:24.390 --> 00:05:24.400 
it can really do wonders can be some

00:05:24.400 --> 00:05:27.240 
it can really do wonders can be some
issues<00:05:24.639> because<00:05:24.760> it's<00:05:25.210> mutual<00:05:25.620> density<00:05:26.620> or

00:05:27.240 --> 00:05:27.250 
issues because it's mutual density or

00:05:27.250 --> 00:05:30.659 
issues because it's mutual density or
because<00:05:27.580> it<00:05:27.700> graduated<00:05:28.210> its<00:05:28.690> air<00:05:29.400> it<00:05:30.400> will

00:05:30.659 --> 00:05:30.669 
because it graduated its air it will

00:05:30.669 --> 00:05:32.400 
because it graduated its air it will
mean<00:05:31.120> some<00:05:31.389> of<00:05:31.419> those<00:05:31.510> trees<00:05:31.780> will<00:05:31.960> be<00:05:32.050> darker

00:05:32.400 --> 00:05:32.410 
mean some of those trees will be darker

00:05:32.410 --> 00:05:34.740 
mean some of those trees will be darker
but<00:05:32.560> the<00:05:32.800> ground<00:05:32.979> will<00:05:33.070> be<00:05:33.099> brighter<00:05:34.090> so<00:05:34.630> it's

00:05:34.740 --> 00:05:34.750 
but the ground will be brighter so it's

00:05:34.750 --> 00:05:36.990 
but the ground will be brighter so it's
kind<00:05:34.900> of<00:05:34.960> case<00:05:35.139> of<00:05:35.320> it<00:05:35.620> works<00:05:36.580> in<00:05:36.820> certain

00:05:36.990 --> 00:05:37.000 
kind of case of it works in certain

00:05:37.000 --> 00:05:39.330 
kind of case of it works in certain
situations<00:05:37.750> it's<00:05:38.050> really<00:05:38.289> good<00:05:38.440> you<00:05:39.190> would

00:05:39.330 --> 00:05:39.340 
situations it's really good you would

00:05:39.340 --> 00:05:41.909 
situations it's really good you would
never<00:05:39.610> really<00:05:39.729> use<00:05:39.940> it<00:05:40.060> for<00:05:40.090> portraits<00:05:40.690> or<00:05:40.930> or

00:05:41.909 --> 00:05:41.919 
never really use it for portraits or or

00:05:41.919 --> 00:05:43.680 
never really use it for portraits or or
not<00:05:42.310> really<00:05:42.400> even<00:05:42.639> sports<00:05:43.090> stuff<00:05:43.419> but

00:05:43.680 --> 00:05:43.690 
not really even sports stuff but

00:05:43.690 --> 00:05:45.960 
not really even sports stuff but
definitely<00:05:43.950> landscape<00:05:44.950> as<00:05:45.130> stuff<00:05:45.849> where

00:05:45.960 --> 00:05:45.970 
definitely landscape as stuff where

00:05:45.970 --> 00:05:47.460 
definitely landscape as stuff where
you've<00:05:46.090> got<00:05:46.210> the<00:05:46.300> Sun<00:05:46.450> out<00:05:46.690> and<00:05:47.020> got<00:05:47.260> bright

00:05:47.460 --> 00:05:47.470 
you've got the Sun out and got bright

00:05:47.470 --> 00:05:49.170 
you've got the Sun out and got bright
sky<00:05:47.650> in<00:05:47.770> high<00:05:47.919> contrast<00:05:48.310> because<00:05:48.789> it<00:05:48.970> takes

00:05:49.170 --> 00:05:49.180 
sky in high contrast because it takes

00:05:49.180 --> 00:05:51.029 
sky in high contrast because it takes
out<00:05:49.300> the<00:05:49.360> brightness<00:05:49.750> of<00:05:49.870> the<00:05:49.960> sky<00:05:50.199> and<00:05:50.440> keeps

00:05:51.029 --> 00:05:51.039 
out the brightness of the sky and keeps

00:05:51.039 --> 00:05:55.080 
out the brightness of the sky and keeps
the<00:05:52.110> more<00:05:53.110> light<00:05:53.500> in<00:05:53.919> the<00:05:54.099> ground<00:05:54.340> foreground

00:05:55.080 --> 00:05:55.090 
the more light in the ground foreground

00:05:55.090 --> 00:05:57.270 
the more light in the ground foreground
so<00:05:55.630> hope<00:05:55.750> that<00:05:55.810> helps<00:05:55.900> Cheers<00:05:56.500> I<00:05:56.590> know<00:05:56.770> highly
