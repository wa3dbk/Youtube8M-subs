00:03:11.260 --> 00:03:11.270 
and glucose from corn are actually that

00:03:11.270 --> 00:03:12.640 
and glucose from corn are actually that

00:03:19.780 --> 00:03:19.790 
and sourcing organic raw materials so

00:03:19.790 --> 00:03:21.370 
and sourcing organic raw materials so
hopefully<00:03:20.210> in<00:03:20.270> the<00:03:20.300> future<00:03:20.510> these

00:03:21.370 --> 00:03:21.380 
hopefully in the future these

00:03:21.380 --> 00:03:24.310 
hopefully in the future these
