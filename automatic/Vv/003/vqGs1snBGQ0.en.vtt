00:05:34.550 --> 00:05:34.560 
wrestling between each repetition often

00:05:34.560 --> 00:05:36.470 
wrestling between each repetition often
times<00:05:34.800> when<00:05:35.070> we're<00:05:35.220> doing<00:05:35.370> other<00:05:36.000> types<00:05:36.360> of

00:05:36.470 --> 00:05:36.480 
times when we're doing other types of

00:05:36.480 --> 00:05:38.930 
times when we're doing other types of
exercises<00:05:37.230> we<00:05:37.860> want<00:05:38.100> to<00:05:38.190> just<00:05:38.340> go<00:05:38.520> to<00:05:38.580> the<00:05:38.730> next

00:05:38.930 --> 00:05:38.940 
exercises we want to just go to the next

00:05:38.940 --> 00:05:39.470 
exercises we want to just go to the next
thing

00:05:39.470 --> 00:05:39.480 
thing

00:05:39.480 --> 00:05:42.500 
thing
so<00:05:39.660> in<00:05:39.930> half<00:05:40.140> and<00:05:40.470> somatic<00:05:41.010> exploration<00:05:41.700> we

00:05:42.500 --> 00:05:42.510 
so in half and somatic exploration we

00:05:42.510 --> 00:05:44.290 
so in half and somatic exploration we
really<00:05:42.780> want<00:05:42.960> to<00:05:43.020> pause<00:05:43.260> between<00:05:43.620> each

00:05:44.290 --> 00:05:44.300 
really want to pause between each

00:05:44.300 --> 00:05:46.340 
really want to pause between each
repetitions<00:05:45.300> so<00:05:45.450> that<00:05:45.600> the<00:05:45.840> brain<00:05:46.080> can

00:05:46.340 --> 00:05:46.350 
repetitions so that the brain can

00:05:46.350 --> 00:05:50.300 
repetitions so that the brain can
register<00:05:46.590> the<00:05:47.550> new<00:05:47.670> patterning<00:05:49.010> so<00:05:50.010> thank<00:05:50.220> you

00:05:50.300 --> 00:05:50.310 
register the new patterning so thank you

00:05:50.310 --> 00:05:51.830 
register the new patterning so thank you
that<00:05:50.460> was<00:05:50.580> wonderful<00:05:50.910> so<00:05:51.180> just<00:05:51.390> pause<00:05:51.600> your

all the neural pathways being open in
Chinese<00:06:17.690> medicine<00:06:17.900> we<00:06:18.320> call<00:06:18.560> them<00:06:19.240> well
