 a morning beauty ritual in four 

00:00:28.560 --> 00:00:30.869
 steps 

00:00:28.949 --> 00:00:33.149
 for that you will need four 

00:00:30.869 --> 00:00:35.520
 products so a face cleanser a 

00:00:33.149 --> 00:00:36.870
 sermon face and neck an eye contour 

00:00:35.520 --> 00:00:38.700
 as well as a moisturizer 

00:00:36.870 --> 00:00:40.950
 first of all we will do a cleaning 

00:00:38.700 --> 00:00:43.710
 skin for cleaning 

00:00:40.950 --> 00:00:45.629
 fast and efficient we will focus on 

00:00:43.710 --> 00:00:47.160
 products two in one that does not rinse 

00:00:45.629 --> 00:00:47.670
 we have the choice between three 

00:00:47.160 --> 00:00:50.039
 techniques 

00:00:47.670 --> 00:00:52.379
 the micellar notion the tonic or 

00:00:50.039 --> 00:00:53.850
 again the make-up remover then here 

00:00:52.379 --> 00:00:56.370
 I chose the tonics 

00:00:53.850 --> 00:00:59.250
 in fact we will take a brake 

00:00:56.370 --> 00:01:04.229
 we will apply a small amount on 

00:00:59.250 --> 00:01:05.970
 the cotton so we will apply the product 

00:01:04.229 --> 00:01:08.240
 from the inside to the outside of the 

00:01:05.970 --> 00:01:10.500
 face by circular motions 

00:01:08.240 --> 00:01:11.400
 to follow the direction of the traffic 

00:01:10.500 --> 00:01:14.479
 sanguine 

00:01:11.400 --> 00:01:14.479
 not to mention the kick 

00:01:15.980 --> 00:01:19.400
 it's really important 

00:01:17.780 --> 00:01:21.440
 since it helps rid the 

00:01:19.400 --> 00:01:23.480
 skin impurities and prepare it for 

00:01:21.440 --> 00:01:24.980
 receive future care have then 

00:01:23.480 --> 00:01:27.380
 moved to the application stage of 

00:01:24.980 --> 00:01:29.420
 face and neck serum so the serums are 

00:01:27.380 --> 00:01:31.220
 very active products very concentrated 

00:01:29.420 --> 00:01:32.200
 which strengthen the action of the 

00:01:31.220 --> 00:01:36.470
 creams 

00:01:32.200 --> 00:01:38.030
 here we have a face and neck serum we go in 

00:01:36.470 --> 00:01:41.780
 put a small amount of ink from the 

00:01:38.030 --> 00:01:44.810
 hand how then heated between 

00:01:41.780 --> 00:01:46.760
 hands we will now apply it on 

00:01:44.810 --> 00:01:47.920
 the face always have center towards 

00:01:46.760 --> 00:01:50.000
 outdoors 

00:01:47.920 --> 00:01:51.550
 so after we make movements 

00:01:50.000 --> 00:01:54.740
 circular 

00:01:51.550 --> 00:01:56.480
 it then insists of course the zones 

00:01:54.740 --> 00:02:01.850
 subject to wrinkles so the furrows 

00:01:56.480 --> 00:02:03.940
 nasogens the crow's feet as well as 

00:02:01.850 --> 00:02:08.030
 lion's wrinkles 

00:02:03.940 --> 00:02:10.130
 not to mention the hang still have a 

00:02:08.030 --> 00:02:11.120
 descending to follow the meaning of the 

00:02:10.130 --> 00:02:14.000
 blood circulation 

00:02:11.120 --> 00:02:15.140
 then we go to the eye area 

00:02:14.000 --> 00:02:17.270
 Care must be taken to choose products 

00:02:15.140 --> 00:02:19.130
 specific since the skin of the outline 

00:02:17.270 --> 00:02:21.830
 eyes is very fine and so very 

00:02:19.130 --> 00:02:22.850
 sensitive so here we chose a serum 

00:02:21.830 --> 00:02:24.830
 eye contour 

00:02:22.850 --> 00:02:27.130
 we will take a small amount 

00:02:24.830 --> 00:02:30.730
 we want to apply to the fingertip 

00:02:27.130 --> 00:02:33.200
 how then heated between the fingers 

00:02:30.730 --> 00:02:35.300
 and then we apply it always 

00:02:33.200 --> 00:02:39.380
 from the inner corner to the outer corner of 

00:02:35.300 --> 00:02:43.310
 the unparalleled bed- eye on 

00:02:39.380 --> 00:02:46.040
 upper eyelids to stimulate the 

00:02:43.310 --> 00:02:48.860
 lymphatic drainage and then one 

00:02:46.040 --> 00:02:49.930
 tap to facilitate the penetration of 

00:02:48.860 --> 00:02:51.920
 product 

00:02:49.930 --> 00:02:53.180
 and now we will go to 

00:02:51.920 --> 00:02:55.670
 the application of a day cream 

00:02:53.180 --> 00:02:57.440
 moisturizing so hydration is very 

00:02:55.670 --> 00:02:59.270
 important since it's the first 

00:02:57.440 --> 00:03:00.100
 prevention gesture against the appearance 

00:02:59.270 --> 00:03:03.770
 wrinkles 

00:03:00.100 --> 00:03:07.550
 here we have a hydrating potted cream 

00:03:03.770 --> 00:03:09.470
 so little trick if your care has 

00:03:07.550 --> 00:03:11.060
 one to percussion I advise you to 

00:03:09.470 --> 00:03:13.040
 keep the father that she since that 

00:03:11.060 --> 00:03:15.880
 avoid the dispersion of the principles 

00:03:13.040 --> 00:03:15.880
 cream actives 

00:03:17.120 --> 00:03:23.180
 we will take a small amount of 

00:03:19.400 --> 00:03:24.640
 cream we will put in the hollow of his 

00:03:23.180 --> 00:03:28.540
 hand 

00:03:24.640 --> 00:03:28.540
 we will then heat it 

00:03:29.880 --> 00:03:34.220
 we will then apply it on the face 

00:03:32.100 --> 00:03:37.590
 so always from the center to the outside 

00:03:34.220 --> 00:03:39.120
 with circular motions is 

00:03:37.590 --> 00:03:41.700
 also on the move 

00:03:39.120 --> 00:03:44.670
 with downward movement allows the 

00:03:41.700 --> 00:03:46.380
 sides now here is your skin is 

00:03:44.670 --> 00:03:47.940
 quite clean perfectly hydrated 

00:03:46.380 --> 00:03:50.300
 is ready to move to the stage of 

00:03:47.940 --> 00:03:50.300
 makeup
