trade<00:01:02.090> I<00:01:03.090> think<00:01:03.750> because<00:01:04.140> basically<00:01:04.410> they're

00:01:04.820 --> 00:01:04.830 
trade I think because basically they're

00:01:04.830 --> 00:01:07.999 
trade I think because basically they're
gamblers<00:01:05.339> or<00:01:06.179> they've<00:01:07.170> just<00:01:07.440> fall<00:01:07.679> for<00:01:07.920> the

00:01:07.999 --> 00:01:08.009 
gamblers or they've just fall for the

00:01:08.009 --> 00:01:10.490 
gamblers or they've just fall for the
myth<00:01:08.220> of<00:01:08.520> the<00:01:08.550> action<00:01:09.210> you<00:01:09.899> know<00:01:10.050> being<00:01:10.320> in

there<00:01:10.710> they're<00:01:10.800> going<00:01:10.890> to<00:01:10.950> make<00:01:11.130> money<00:01:11.369> or<00:01:11.670> hit

00:01:11.840 --> 00:01:11.850 
there they're going to make money or hit

00:01:11.850 --> 00:01:13.670 
there they're going to make money or hit
the<00:01:11.970> big<00:01:12.150> one<00:01:12.390> but<00:01:12.659> really<00:01:12.990> they<00:01:13.350> should<00:01:13.380> go<00:01:13.619> to

00:01:13.670 --> 00:01:13.680 
the big one but really they should go to

00:01:13.680 --> 00:01:15.859 
the big one but really they should go to
a<00:01:13.799> casino<00:01:14.119> they'll<00:01:15.119> make<00:01:15.270> more<00:01:15.390> money<00:01:15.570> and

00:01:15.859 --> 00:01:15.869

00:01:20.630 --> 00:01:20.640 
have more fun now another strategy which

00:01:20.640 --> 00:01:22.789 
have more fun now another strategy which
I<00:01:20.790> want<00:01:20.939> to<00:01:21.000> discuss<00:01:21.150> which<00:01:21.689> is<00:01:21.900> extremely

00:01:22.789 --> 00:01:22.799 
I want to discuss which is extremely

00:01:22.799 --> 00:01:26.990 
I want to discuss which is extremely
popular<00:01:23.810> but<00:01:24.810> it's<00:01:25.200> total<00:01:25.560> nonsense<00:01:25.590> is<00:01:26.369> the

00:01:26.990 --> 00:01:27.000 
popular but it's total nonsense is the

00:01:27.000 --> 00:01:29.899 
popular but it's total nonsense is the
Fibonacci<00:01:27.420> number<00:01:28.020> sequence<00:01:28.549> you'll<00:01:29.549> see

00:01:29.899 --> 00:01:29.909 
Fibonacci number sequence you'll see

00:01:29.909 --> 00:01:34.160 
Fibonacci number sequence you'll see
serious<00:01:30.869> bankers<00:01:31.860> brokers<00:01:33.020> recommend<00:01:34.020> this

00:01:34.160 --> 00:01:34.170 
serious bankers brokers recommend this

00:01:34.170 --> 00:01:36.499 
serious bankers brokers recommend this
is<00:01:34.380> a<00:01:34.409> good<00:01:34.650> trading<00:01:34.950> strategy<00:01:35.700> but<00:01:36.329> let's

00:01:36.499 --> 00:01:36.509 
is a good trading strategy but let's

00:01:36.509 --> 00:01:40.130 
is a good trading strategy but let's
just<00:01:36.689> look<00:01:36.840> at<00:01:36.960> what<00:01:37.200> Fibonacci<00:01:37.710> actually<00:01:39.140> was

00:01:40.130 --> 00:01:40.140 
just look at what Fibonacci actually was

00:01:40.140 --> 00:01:42.590 
just look at what Fibonacci actually was
in<00:01:40.590> terms<00:01:40.829> of<00:01:40.979> a<00:01:41.040> strategy<00:01:41.159> and<00:01:42.060> it<00:01:42.299> wasn't<00:01:42.570> a

00:01:42.590 --> 00:01:42.600 
in terms of a strategy and it wasn't a

00:01:42.600 --> 00:01:44.480 
in terms of a strategy and it wasn't a
strategy<00:01:43.020> at<00:01:43.110> all<00:01:43.259> it<00:01:43.680> has<00:01:43.799> nothing<00:01:44.280> to<00:01:44.310> do

00:01:44.480 --> 00:01:44.490 
strategy at all it has nothing to do

00:01:44.490 --> 00:01:48.490 
strategy at all it has nothing to do
with<00:01:44.610> forex<00:01:45.200> it<00:01:46.200> was<00:01:46.320> done<00:01:46.560> in<00:01:46.710> 1202<00:01:47.579> I<00:01:47.970> think

00:01:48.490 --> 00:01:48.500 
with forex it was done in 1202 I think

00:01:48.500 --> 00:01:50.899 
with forex it was done in 1202 I think
by<00:01:49.500> an<00:01:49.860> Italian<00:01:50.280> guy<00:01:50.430> called<00:01:50.700> Leonardo

00:01:50.899 --> 00:01:50.909 
by an Italian guy called Leonardo

00:01:50.909 --> 00:01:54.080 
by an Italian guy called Leonardo
Fibonacci<00:01:51.390> and<00:01:52.219> the<00:01:53.219> Fibonacci<00:01:53.640> number

00:01:54.080 --> 00:01:54.090 
Fibonacci and the Fibonacci number

00:01:54.090 --> 00:01:58.730 
Fibonacci and the Fibonacci number
sequence<00:01:54.710> comes<00:01:55.710> from<00:01:56.219> a<00:01:56.310> problem<00:01:56.579> to<00:01:57.360> do<00:01:57.740> with

00:01:58.730 --> 00:01:58.740 
sequence comes from a problem to do with

00:01:58.740 --> 00:02:03.459 
sequence comes from a problem to do with
the<00:01:59.130> copulation<00:01:59.759> of<00:02:00.119> rabbits<00:02:00.630> and<00:02:01.070> the<00:02:02.070> basic

00:02:03.459 --> 00:02:03.469 
the copulation of rabbits and the basic

00:02:03.469 --> 00:02:05.630 
the copulation of rabbits and the basic
formula<00:02:04.469> comes<00:02:04.680> from<00:02:04.829> this<00:02:04.950> it's<00:02:05.189> like<00:02:05.369> if<00:02:05.490> you

00:02:05.630 --> 00:02:05.640 
formula comes from this it's like if you

00:02:05.640 --> 00:02:08.830 
formula comes from this it's like if you
have<00:02:05.880> a<00:02:05.909> pair<00:02:06.210> of<00:02:06.240> rabbits<00:02:06.479> and<00:02:06.960> they<00:02:07.740> produce

00:02:08.830 --> 00:02:08.840 
have a pair of rabbits and they produce

00:02:08.840 --> 00:02:11.810 
have a pair of rabbits and they produce
another<00:02:09.840> rabbit<00:02:10.259> and<00:02:10.709> then<00:02:11.070> a<00:02:11.280> month<00:02:11.459> later

00:02:11.810 --> 00:02:11.820 
another rabbit and then a month later

00:02:11.820 --> 00:02:14.120 
another rabbit and then a month later
you<00:02:12.030> get<00:02:12.360> a<00:02:12.420> rabbit<00:02:12.630> pair<00:02:13.019> producing<00:02:13.950> more

00:02:14.120 --> 00:02:14.130 
you get a rabbit pair producing more

00:02:14.130 --> 00:02:16.580 
you get a rabbit pair producing more
rabbits<00:02:14.519> you<00:02:15.060> obviously<00:02:15.360> got<00:02:15.590> increasing

00:02:16.580 --> 00:02:16.590 
rabbits you obviously got increasing

00:02:16.590 --> 00:02:19.220 
rabbits you obviously got increasing
numbers<00:02:16.859> of<00:02:16.889> rabbits<00:02:17.930> there<00:02:18.930> you<00:02:19.049> might<00:02:19.199> be
