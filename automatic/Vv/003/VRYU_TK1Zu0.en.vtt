for you will feel really full will you
drink<00:01:30.639> that<00:01:30.759> and<00:01:31.679> there<00:01:32.679> were<00:01:32.799> moments<00:01:33.100> when<00:01:33.399> I

00:01:33.449 --> 00:01:33.459 
drink that and there were moments when I

00:01:33.459 --> 00:01:35.039 
drink that and there were moments when I
thought<00:01:33.490> I<00:01:33.670> couldn't<00:01:33.789> keep<00:01:34.119> it<00:01:34.209> down<00:01:34.389> but<00:01:34.779> it

00:01:35.039 --> 00:01:35.049 
thought I couldn't keep it down but it

00:01:35.049 --> 00:01:37.559 
thought I couldn't keep it down but it
fade<00:01:35.380> made<00:01:35.920> my<00:01:36.039> stomach<00:01:36.219> a<00:01:36.429> little<00:01:36.459> upset<00:01:37.090> but

00:01:37.559 --> 00:01:37.569 
fade made my stomach a little upset but

00:01:37.569 --> 00:01:40.999 
fade made my stomach a little upset but
I<00:01:37.630> guess<00:01:38.439> that's<00:01:38.649> the<00:01:38.740> point<00:01:38.920> right<00:01:39.389> so<00:01:40.389> I

00:01:40.999 --> 00:01:41.009 
I guess that's the point right so I

00:01:41.009 --> 00:01:43.289 
I guess that's the point right so I
finished<00:01:42.009> drinking<00:01:42.459> it<00:01:42.729> around<00:01:42.969> probably

00:01:43.289 --> 00:01:43.299 
finished drinking it around probably

00:01:43.299 --> 00:01:44.789 
finished drinking it around probably
like<00:01:43.509> 630<00:01:43.990> I<00:01:44.079> came<00:01:44.319> back<00:01:44.469> and<00:01:44.679> lay<00:01:44.770> down

00:01:44.789 --> 00:01:44.799 
like 630 I came back and lay down

00:01:44.799 --> 00:01:46.289 
like 630 I came back and lay down
thinking<00:01:45.429> I<00:01:45.520> was<00:01:45.609> gonna<00:01:45.729> have<00:01:45.939> like<00:01:46.119> at<00:01:46.270> least

00:01:46.289 --> 00:01:46.299 
thinking I was gonna have like at least

00:01:46.299 --> 00:01:48.359 
thinking I was gonna have like at least
a<00:01:46.539> good<00:01:46.689> hour<00:01:46.929> until<00:01:47.439> it<00:01:47.560> took<00:01:47.740> effect<00:01:48.069> but<00:01:48.310> I

00:01:48.359 --> 00:01:48.369 
a good hour until it took effect but I

00:01:48.369 --> 00:01:50.940 
a good hour until it took effect but I
will<00:01:48.670> say<00:01:48.789> this<00:01:48.999> i<00:01:49.270> drank<00:01:50.200> that<00:01:50.439> and<00:01:50.679> i<00:01:50.740> think

00:01:50.940 --> 00:01:50.950 
will say this i drank that and i think

00:01:50.950 --> 00:01:52.649 
will say this i drank that and i think
i'll<00:01:51.069> probably<00:01:51.369> up<00:01:51.639> less<00:01:52.060> than<00:01:52.270> 10<00:01:52.450> minutes

I think you probably won an hour and a

00:02:08.890 --> 00:02:13.289 
I think you probably won an hour and a
half<00:02:09.360> it<00:02:10.380> consisted<00:02:11.380> of<00:02:11.560> me<00:02:12.549> thinking<00:02:13.150> I'm

00:02:13.289 --> 00:02:13.299 
half it consisted of me thinking I'm

00:02:13.299 --> 00:02:16.289 
half it consisted of me thinking I'm
done<00:02:14.290> come<00:02:15.040> and<00:02:15.220> laying<00:02:15.400> back<00:02:15.610> down<00:02:15.670> very

00:02:16.289 --> 00:02:16.299 
done come and laying back down very

00:02:16.299 --> 00:02:17.690 
done come and laying back down very
comfortable<00:02:16.810> and

00:02:17.690 --> 00:02:17.700 
comfortable and

00:02:17.700 --> 00:02:20.809 
comfortable and
almost<00:02:18.599> like<00:02:18.780> running<00:02:19.530> back<00:02:20.160> to<00:02:20.520> the<00:02:20.580> bath

00:02:20.809 --> 00:02:20.819

Roman<00:02:21.390> that<00:02:22.170> was<00:02:22.410> an<00:02:22.530> ordeal<00:02:22.920> and<00:02:23.760> I<00:02:23.879> think

00:02:24.080 --> 00:02:24.090 
Roman that was an ordeal and I think

00:02:24.090 --> 00:02:25.490 
Roman that was an ordeal and I think
partly<00:02:24.360> because<00:02:24.540> you<00:02:24.930> know<00:02:25.019> it's<00:02:25.200> the<00:02:25.290> first

00:02:25.490 --> 00:02:25.500 
partly because you know it's the first

00:02:25.500 --> 00:02:27.080 
partly because you know it's the first
day<00:02:25.650> of<00:02:25.680> course<00:02:25.980> that's<00:02:26.160> like<00:02:26.430> to<00:02:26.700> start<00:02:26.970> off

00:02:27.080 --> 00:02:27.090 
day of course that's like to start off

00:02:27.090 --> 00:02:30.199 
day of course that's like to start off
getting<00:02:27.330> the<00:02:27.660> bulk<00:02:28.260> of<00:02:28.650> everything<00:02:29.400> and<00:02:29.700> also

00:02:30.199 --> 00:02:30.209

00:02:30.209 --> 00:02:32.360 
getting the bulk of everything and also
I<00:02:30.360> had<00:02:30.510> a<00:02:30.540> really<00:02:30.900> really<00:02:31.200> really<00:02:31.800> big<00:02:31.980> last
