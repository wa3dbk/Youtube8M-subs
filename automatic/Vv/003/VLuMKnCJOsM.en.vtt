00:00:01.300 --> 00:00:07.300
 Lumi: ......... MacBook, did not release it. It should have been a talk on the 10th. 

00:00:08.300 --> 00:00:17.280
 Kouyou: It was careless ... The April 10 release date is likely to be for American time zones. When it comes to Japan, 11 days in Japan ... No possibility of becoming even longer ... ... 

00:00:17.300 --> 00:00:26.300
 Kouyou: Rather than that, now we have to pray for release. Let's wait for good news, hoping to be on the Apple Store tomorrow. All the news items scheduled for today have blown away. 

00:00:27.300 --> 00:00:33.300
 Lumi: Because there is such a thing, it prepares for it properly and prepares a spare material. 

00:00:35.400 --> 00:00:41.300
 Lumi: ... and what is that pose? Is there anything wrong? 

00:00:41.400 --> 00:00:45.400
 Ahh, Kos, or same say Kosm ... 

00:00:45.500 --> 00:00:47.500
 Do you hear our prayers? 

00:00:47.600 --> 00:00:51.400
 Lumi: ... don't do it! The communication is ... what the Mensis school did it. 

00:00:59.000 --> 00:01:08.000
 Lumi: But that MacBook is pretty badly reputed from the YouTubers in Japan. Still, why is there some reason to buy it? 

00:01:08.000 --> 00:01:17.500
 Kouyou: I feel like you are full of benefits just because you are such a YouTuber. That weight and size, and to some extent FCPX's ability to move, is more than enough. 

00:01:18.500 --> 00:01:27.400
 Kouyou: The operating conditions of FinalCut Pro X are not surprisingly high. You can use at least 4GB / 256MB of memory, VRAM, Intel HD Graphics 3000 or more. In other words, it works with the entry model. 

00:01:27.500 --> 00:01:36.500
 Kouyou: The entry model seems to have slightly higher performance than the 2012 MacBook Air. Then it would be usable without problems. ...... Although I do not use this in the main though. 

00:01:37.000 --> 00:01:46.000
 Lumi: But what I care about is the power of the CPU. It was Intel's CoreM ... that processing speed is quite low on the catalog, but you can move OSX comfortably in the first place. 

00:01:46.500 --> 00:01:55.400
 Kouyou: Certainly, this Intel Core M processor is a CPU that operates with unprecedented low power consumption. Although the processing capacity is certainly appropriate, the ratio of power consumption and processing capacity is excellent. 

00:01:55.500 --> 00:02:04.500
 Kouyou: The efficiency of processing speed per watt is good. Due to its size, high speed processing like Core i5 / i7 is difficult. The point is that you can do some "production work". 

00:02:05.000 --> 00:02:14.000
 Kouyou: There is a photo that actually runs FCPX in a review on the other side (TechCrunch), but I used it like this before introducing MacPro, so it should be possible without advanced editing. 

00:02:14.500 --> 00:02:20.500
 Lumi: What kind of advanced editing is it? For example, VFX or 3D related ...? 

00:02:24.100 --> 00:02:28.400
 Kouyou: Do you stack multiple effects like this? 

00:02:28.980 --> 00:02:34.900
 Lumi: A very old prototype ...! First of all, this time is short, but do you leave it here? 

00:02:34.980 --> 00:02:40.980
 Lumi: Pray for release tomorrow ... No, this is 4/10 evening in Western time, and maybe it will be alright.
