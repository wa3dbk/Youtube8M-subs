00:00:07.350 --> 00:00:11.620
 Hello everyone, vigy 

00:00:09.520 --> 00:00:13.960
 and today i will talk about how to remove 

00:00:11.620 --> 00:00:16.059
 we have a normal normal map 

00:00:13.960 --> 00:00:18.070
 original model and low poly 

00:00:16.059 --> 00:00:19.480
 models to remove the card 

00:00:18.070 --> 00:00:21.369
 ok you first need to 

00:00:19.480 --> 00:00:24.430
 low poly models hold back 

00:00:21.369 --> 00:00:26.130
 do a scan I will do it when 

00:00:24.430 --> 00:00:29.529
 help 

00:00:26.130 --> 00:00:31.480
 Europe modifier automatically more accurate 

00:00:29.529 --> 00:00:35.460
 it has already been done to me, I automatically 

00:00:31.480 --> 00:00:38.110
 show mapper casaton mapping again and 

00:00:35.460 --> 00:00:43.950
 so all the scan done translate 

00:00:38.110 --> 00:00:46.059
 field will come out now we need to align 

00:00:43.950 --> 00:00:49.410
 blank our low poly model 

00:00:46.059 --> 00:00:49.410
 down polygon model 

00:00:49.829 --> 00:00:58.870
 so but basically ok i mean 

00:00:56.590 --> 00:01:01.180
 cards anyway don't bake with such 

00:00:58.870 --> 00:01:03.910
 maybe the only thing high example 

00:01:01.180 --> 00:01:06.090
 issuing can do less but like this 

00:01:03.910 --> 00:01:09.130
 ok so choose 

00:01:06.090 --> 00:01:10.000
 low poly model press key 0 

00:01:09.130 --> 00:01:12.280
 and or 

00:01:10.000 --> 00:01:20.789
 in the rendering tab select render 

00:01:12.280 --> 00:01:25.690
 textures so here we put on 115 so 

00:01:20.789 --> 00:01:27.750
 here we press and it was the peak and choose 

00:01:25.690 --> 00:01:29.250
 high poly model in the list 

00:01:27.750 --> 00:01:33.849
 of objects 

00:01:29.250 --> 00:01:35.950
 appearing cell projection so 

00:01:33.849 --> 00:01:39.520
 next now we need to configure this 

00:01:35.950 --> 00:01:43.149
 modifier projection cell 

00:01:39.520 --> 00:01:52.509
 there was a projection modifier click 

00:01:43.149 --> 00:01:57.310
 reset and increase the number of hours more precisely 

00:01:52.509 --> 00:02:01.149
 distance from projection so 

00:01:57.310 --> 00:02:02.890
 way we have a cell to capture 

00:02:01.149 --> 00:02:04.500
 completely that high polygonal 

00:02:02.890 --> 00:02:08.399
 model that low poly 

00:02:04.500 --> 00:02:11.550
 for clarity, you can include shading and 

00:02:08.399 --> 00:02:15.510
 see that here and so it is clear that the cell 

00:02:11.550 --> 00:02:18.240
 all overlaps here if it is not 

00:02:15.510 --> 00:02:19.920
 overlap in this way then these 

00:02:18.240 --> 00:02:22.170
 details they are just a bottom 

00:02:19.920 --> 00:02:26.370
 projected and on rendering it will be 

00:02:22.170 --> 00:02:27.990
 look red so what you need 

00:02:26.370 --> 00:02:30.300
 do as much as possible 

00:02:27.990 --> 00:02:33.950
 but it's not always good because 

00:02:30.300 --> 00:02:38.000
 different details with concave 

00:02:33.950 --> 00:02:42.840
 lines more cool that is there need 

00:02:38.000 --> 00:02:46.280
 certain approach so here we have a trinity 

00:02:42.840 --> 00:02:46.280
 ready further choose here 

00:02:47.150 --> 00:02:53.760
 channel 1 what we high 

00:02:50.850 --> 00:02:56.100
 polygonal model from the first channel and 

00:02:53.760 --> 00:02:59.070
 on the low poly model too 

00:02:56.100 --> 00:03:01.290
 the first channel we will render so 

00:02:59.070 --> 00:03:04.920
 further here we choose what we bump 

00:03:01.290 --> 00:03:07.760
 Render add normal map that here 

00:03:04.920 --> 00:03:12.660
 The card is normal so it can be presented 

00:03:07.760 --> 00:03:16.700
 so here we choose the way where we will you 

00:03:12.660 --> 00:03:16.700
 render so 

00:03:22.350 --> 00:03:25.610
 choose the format of you 

00:03:27.860 --> 00:03:34.390
 glue 

00:03:28.990 --> 00:03:38.710
 gram resolution I will put 2048 and in 

00:03:34.390 --> 00:03:44.080
 In principle, everything else I choose you 

00:03:38.710 --> 00:03:52.750
 the printer with the canvas to us so although you can and 

00:03:44.080 --> 00:03:57.270
 probably give me with me as Omsk 

00:03:52.750 --> 00:03:57.270
 online and click render 

00:04:04.950 --> 00:04:09.540
 what the map looks like right now 

00:04:07.620 --> 00:04:14.580
 sera video your day pay attention 

00:04:09.540 --> 00:04:17.120
 it already she looks like she already 

00:04:14.580 --> 00:04:19.079
 applied to the object 

00:04:17.120 --> 00:04:22.590
 in fact, it looks like 

00:04:19.079 --> 00:04:27.050
 that is, it looks like this 

00:04:22.590 --> 00:04:29.340
 in the same way we now apply it 

00:04:27.050 --> 00:04:31.350
 to our 

00:04:29.340 --> 00:04:37.530
 low poly model so it can 

00:04:31.350 --> 00:04:40.400
 hide click edit poly so choose 

00:04:37.530 --> 00:04:40.400
 standard material 

00:04:42.710 --> 00:04:51.960
 content is so standard 3 so here 

00:04:49.680 --> 00:04:55.950
 turn on the bump put 100 

00:04:51.960 --> 00:04:59.910
 to see better here we choose 

00:04:55.950 --> 00:05:01.680
 normal map for vira i will be different 

00:04:59.910 --> 00:05:06.979
 the card is not the norm both will be called 

00:05:01.680 --> 00:05:16.410
 faith normal map and drag in 

00:05:06.979 --> 00:05:19.289
 slot normal our normal map and now 

00:05:16.410 --> 00:05:21.139
 apply this material to our object 

00:05:19.289 --> 00:05:27.180
 turn on the display 

00:05:21.139 --> 00:05:29.010
 Realistic mapping and here we include 

00:05:27.180 --> 00:05:30.180
 as you can see we have a map 

00:05:29.010 --> 00:05:34.200
 ok now on low poly 

00:05:30.180 --> 00:05:40.440
 models and if we turn on the light 

00:05:34.200 --> 00:05:43.639
 we will see that the map will affect 

00:05:40.440 --> 00:05:43.639
 light intensity 

00:05:46.440 --> 00:05:53.450
 that is, if we move the light of the 

00:05:50.160 --> 00:05:59.340
 kooks then i'm his far to the nail and well yes 

00:05:53.450 --> 00:06:01.550
 so here we see what appear behind 

00:05:59.340 --> 00:06:08.880
 various blackout 

00:06:01.550 --> 00:06:16.080
 dimming glare in the map is normal 

00:06:08.880 --> 00:06:18.090
 we recorded as well and how it will be 

00:06:16.080 --> 00:06:20.250
 look on render 1 of bell 

00:06:18.090 --> 00:06:23.930
 also look like if we are here 

00:06:20.250 --> 00:06:23.930
 again stella 

00:06:27.480 --> 00:06:34.310
 so by the name of which the intensity is made 

00:06:31.470 --> 00:06:34.310
 This is true 

00:06:42.520 --> 00:06:46.330
 here that we also had from 

00:06:44.860 --> 00:06:51.810
 display normal maps 

00:06:46.330 --> 00:06:58.479
 and so I will tell you several nuances at once 

00:06:51.810 --> 00:07:01.690
 if you so convex sides here at 

00:06:58.479 --> 00:07:03.849
 us it is convex in geometry even 

00:07:01.690 --> 00:07:06.610
 on a high poly model now i'm 

00:07:03.849 --> 00:07:10.870
 open these rings here it is convex 

00:07:06.610 --> 00:07:12.970
 geometry then retopology topology too 

00:07:10.870 --> 00:07:16.419
 it is better here to slightly convex to 

00:07:12.970 --> 00:07:20.740
 from this perspective it was clear that here 

00:07:16.419 --> 00:07:25.659
 also have the geometry of the concave section does not 

00:07:20.740 --> 00:07:27.639
 be sure to do the geometry that is 

00:07:25.659 --> 00:07:30.000
 draw a product topology because 

00:07:27.639 --> 00:07:34.419
 that well, then it will not be seen, we 

00:07:30.000 --> 00:07:36.490
 let's see yes there is no need there 

00:07:34.419 --> 00:07:38.979
 probably this angle to make it 

00:07:36.490 --> 00:07:41.139
 it can be seen that it is very close 

00:07:38.979 --> 00:07:44.789
 marriage custom in such close ones not 

00:07:41.139 --> 00:07:44.789
 happens here 

00:07:48.409 --> 00:07:54.050
 that is, slightly-slightly done by login 

00:07:51.259 --> 00:07:55.610
 arita the gentlemen about creating sweeps i 

00:07:54.050 --> 00:07:57.919
 I will tell in the next lessons 

00:07:55.610 --> 00:08:01.339
 also we will get acquainted with epaulets you're 

00:07:57.919 --> 00:08:04.009
 out a program 3 whether the code and you do 

00:08:01.339 --> 00:08:06.199
 retopology and further 

00:08:04.009 --> 00:08:09.860
 I will tell you a few more details about 

00:08:06.199 --> 00:08:12.379
 drawing textures and correct unwrapping 

00:08:09.860 --> 00:08:14.860
 Thank you all for your attention Luigi do 

00:08:12.379 --> 00:08:14.860
 dating
