00:01:55.150 --> 00:01:55.160 
Robo here I'll point out the corners I

00:01:55.160 --> 00:01:58.480 
Robo here I'll point out the corners I
think<00:01:55.460> will<00:01:55.580> probably<00:01:55.610> be<00:01:56.119> an<00:01:56.540> issue<00:01:57.490> this

00:01:58.480 --> 00:01:58.490 
think will probably be an issue this

00:01:58.490 --> 00:02:00.280 
think will probably be an issue this
funny<00:01:58.790> if<00:01:59.150> you<00:01:59.180> don't<00:01:59.420> get<00:01:59.540> it<00:01:59.660> right<00:01:59.690> you<00:02:00.170> can

00:02:00.280 --> 00:02:00.290 
funny if you don't get it right you can

00:02:00.290 --> 00:02:05.469 
funny if you don't get it right you can
easily<00:02:00.500> skit<00:02:00.860> on<00:02:00.890> this<00:02:01.130> one<00:02:02.890> the<00:02:03.890> real<00:02:04.759> bad

00:02:05.469 --> 00:02:05.479 
easily skit on this one the real bad

00:02:05.479 --> 00:02:07.630 
easily skit on this one the real bad
what<00:02:05.840> I<00:02:05.869> think<00:02:06.350> there's<00:02:06.830> a<00:02:06.920> left<00:02:07.100> and<00:02:07.310> one<00:02:07.520> up

00:02:07.630 --> 00:02:07.640 
what I think there's a left and one up

00:02:07.640 --> 00:02:08.560 
what I think there's a left and one up
here<00:02:07.880> in<00:02:08.000> a<00:02:08.060> minute

00:02:08.560 --> 00:02:08.570 
here in a minute

00:02:08.570 --> 00:02:11.710 
here in a minute
next<00:02:09.080> one<00:02:09.229> data<00:02:09.440> format<00:02:09.950> is<00:02:10.070> heal<00:02:10.310> and<00:02:11.150> go<00:02:11.270> past

00:02:11.710 --> 00:02:11.720 
next one data format is heal and go past

00:02:11.720 --> 00:02:13.690 
next one data format is heal and go past
a<00:02:11.930> breach<00:02:12.170> this<00:02:12.560> is<00:02:12.800> this<00:02:13.040> is<00:02:13.250> going<00:02:13.430> to<00:02:13.489> be<00:02:13.580> the

00:02:13.690 --> 00:02:13.700 
a breach this is this is going to be the

00:02:13.700 --> 00:02:17.830 
a breach this is this is going to be the
corner<00:02:14.560> if<00:02:15.560> you're<00:02:15.800> gonna<00:02:16.090> skate<00:02:17.090> Orica<00:02:17.720> it's

00:02:17.830 --> 00:02:17.840 
corner if you're gonna skate Orica it's

00:02:17.840 --> 00:02:21.869 
corner if you're gonna skate Orica it's
going<00:02:17.959> to<00:02:18.020> be<00:02:18.140> rainy<00:02:18.380> spit<00:02:18.709> here

00:02:21.869 --> 00:02:21.879 

00:02:21.879 --> 00:02:23.789 

so<00:02:22.360> looks<00:02:22.599> like<00:02:22.629> it<00:02:22.900> nice<00:02:23.049> and<00:02:23.080> easy<00:02:23.439> round

00:02:23.789 --> 00:02:23.799 
so looks like it nice and easy round

00:02:23.799 --> 00:02:29.449 
so looks like it nice and easy round
that<00:02:24.040> bit

00:02:29.449 --> 00:02:29.459 

00:02:29.459 --> 00:02:31.789 

the<00:02:29.970> rest<00:02:30.180> of<00:02:30.269> it<00:02:30.390> is<00:02:30.569> so<00:02:30.599> tickly<00:02:31.230> round<00:02:31.470> really

00:02:31.789 --> 00:02:31.799 
the rest of it is so tickly round really

00:02:31.799 --> 00:02:36.440 
the rest of it is so tickly round really
I<00:02:34.069> think<00:02:35.069> that's<00:02:35.340> definitely<00:02:35.849> gonna<00:02:36.000> be<00:02:36.090> do

00:02:36.440 --> 00:02:36.450 
I think that's definitely gonna be do

00:02:36.450 --> 00:02:40.030 
I think that's definitely gonna be do
the<00:02:36.900> worst<00:02:37.170> corner<00:02:37.680> for<00:02:37.890> people<00:02:38.459> not<00:02:38.700> used<00:02:39.000> to

00:02:40.030 --> 00:02:40.040 
the worst corner for people not used to

00:02:40.040 --> 00:02:45.080 
the worst corner for people not used to
driving<00:02:41.040> with<00:02:41.400> no<00:02:42.239> traction<00:02:42.629> control<00:02:43.760> so<00:02:44.760> they

00:02:45.080 --> 00:02:45.090 
driving with no traction control so they

00:02:45.090 --> 00:02:47.030 
driving with no traction control so they
turn<00:02:45.269> all<00:02:45.540> of<00:02:45.569> the<00:02:45.870> assists<00:02:46.260> off<00:02:46.379> like<00:02:46.590> I<00:02:46.620> Drive

00:02:47.030 --> 00:02:47.040 
turn all of the assists off like I Drive

00:02:47.040 --> 00:02:49.160 
turn all of the assists off like I Drive
then<00:02:47.519> I<00:02:47.849> think<00:02:48.329> you<00:02:48.450> finally<00:02:48.659> probably<00:02:49.049> more

00:02:49.160 --> 00:02:49.170 
then I think you finally probably more

00:02:49.170 --> 00:02:51.349 
then I think you finally probably more
difficult<00:02:49.349> and<00:02:49.859> I'm<00:02:50.340> sure<00:02:50.609> they<00:02:50.849> will<00:02:50.970> do<00:02:51.180> that

00:02:51.349 --> 00:02:51.359 
difficult and I'm sure they will do that

00:02:51.359 --> 00:02:55.720 
difficult and I'm sure they will do that
later<00:02:51.569> on<00:02:52.430> as<00:02:53.430> we<00:02:53.670> go<00:02:53.819> through<00:02:54.120> these<00:02:54.269> events

00:02:55.720 --> 00:02:55.730 
later on as we go through these events

00:02:55.730 --> 00:02:58.839 
later on as we go through these events

before that all that's that's how you
were<00:03:14.280> warmed<00:03:19.489> could<00:03:20.489> actually<00:03:20.639> have<00:03:20.879> used<00:03:21.090> the

00:03:21.819 --> 00:03:21.829 
were warmed could actually have used the

00:03:21.829 --> 00:03:23.960 
were warmed could actually have used the
mild<00:03:22.829> Everett<00:03:23.129> for<00:03:23.280> the<00:03:23.370> service<00:03:23.730> they<00:03:23.909> were

00:03:30.020 --> 00:03:30.030 
how could I become bit like a room once

00:03:30.030 --> 00:03:34.970 
how could I become bit like a room once
it<00:03:30.209> wants<00:03:30.450> it<00:03:30.569> needs<00:03:30.720> a<00:03:30.810> service<00:03:33.829> if<00:03:34.829> you're

00:03:34.970 --> 00:03:34.980 
it wants it needs a service if you're

00:03:34.980 --> 00:03:36.979 
it wants it needs a service if you're
doing<00:03:35.220> this<00:03:35.370> you<00:03:35.609> know<00:03:35.819> trying<00:03:36.660> to<00:03:36.720> do<00:03:36.840> it<00:03:36.900> in

00:03:36.979 --> 00:03:36.989 
doing this you know trying to do it in

00:03:36.989 --> 00:03:38.920 
doing this you know trying to do it in
one<00:03:37.139> go<00:03:37.379> it'll<00:03:37.650> you<00:03:37.859> know<00:03:37.980> an<00:03:38.280> hour<00:03:38.459> whatever

00:03:38.920 --> 00:03:38.930 
one go it'll you know an hour whatever

one go it'll you know an hour whatever
then<00:03:39.930> you<00:03:40.349> might<00:03:40.530> be<00:03:40.579> better<00:03:41.579> off<00:03:41.699> using

00:03:43.119 --> 00:03:43.129 
then you might be better off using

00:03:43.129 --> 00:03:54.800 
then you might be better off using
arrogant<00:03:44.129> using<00:03:44.730> a<00:03:44.819> gold<00:03:45.030> up<00:03:45.209> for<00:03:45.510> it
