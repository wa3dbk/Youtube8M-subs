and<00:04:17.120> I<00:04:17.390> do<00:04:17.450> not<00:04:17.870> recall<00:04:18.109> what<00:04:18.590> lip<00:04:18.799> liner<00:04:18.829> it<00:04:19.280> is

00:04:19.420 --> 00:04:19.430 
and I do not recall what lip liner it is

00:04:19.430 --> 00:04:22.750 
and I do not recall what lip liner it is
but<00:04:20.209> that<00:04:20.900> is<00:04:21.109> the<00:04:21.140> lip<00:04:21.440> liner<00:04:21.709> there<00:04:22.160> and<00:04:22.490> then

00:04:22.750 --> 00:04:22.760 
but that is the lip liner there and then

00:04:22.760 --> 00:04:25.330
