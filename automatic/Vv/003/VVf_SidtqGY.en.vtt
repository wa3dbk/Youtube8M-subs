00:00:40.440 --> 00:00:40.450 
about the new the settlers game so since

00:00:40.450 --> 00:00:42.780 
about the new the settlers game so since
we<00:00:40.570> are<00:00:40.660> the<00:00:40.810> most<00:00:40.960> innovative<00:00:41.260> setlist<00:00:41.950> we

00:00:42.780 --> 00:00:42.790 
we are the most innovative setlist we

00:00:42.790 --> 00:00:45.270 
we are the most innovative setlist we
have<00:00:43.000> now<00:00:43.330> a<00:00:43.360> one<00:00:43.750> persistent<00:00:44.290> city<00:00:44.620> so<00:00:45.100> it's

00:00:45.270 --> 00:00:45.280 
have now a one persistent city so it's

00:00:45.280 --> 00:00:47.370 
have now a one persistent city so it's
not<00:00:45.700> like<00:00:45.910> before<00:00:46.510> where<00:00:46.720> you<00:00:46.750> build<00:00:47.080> a<00:00:47.260> new

00:00:47.370 --> 00:00:47.380 
not like before where you build a new

00:00:47.380 --> 00:00:49.380 
not like before where you build a new
city<00:00:47.530> over<00:00:47.890> and<00:00:48.040> over<00:00:48.160> again<00:00:48.400> and<00:00:48.640> this<00:00:49.150> means

00:00:49.380 --> 00:00:49.390 
city over and over again and this means

00:00:49.390 --> 00:00:51.810 
city over and over again and this means
that<00:00:49.480> you<00:00:49.720> also<00:00:49.990> will<00:00:50.140> create<00:00:50.500> and<00:00:50.830> improve

00:00:51.810 --> 00:00:51.820 
that you also will create and improve

00:00:51.820 --> 00:00:52.980 
that you also will create and improve
your<00:00:52.000> city<00:00:52.180> over<00:00:52.360> the<00:00:52.480> course<00:00:52.750> of<00:00:52.930> several

00:00:52.980 --> 00:00:52.990 
your city over the course of several

00:00:52.990 --> 00:00:55.800 
your city over the course of several
weeks<00:00:53.500> and<00:00:53.740> even<00:00:53.890> months<00:00:54.370> and<00:00:54.579> this<00:00:55.060> also<00:00:55.329> led

00:00:55.800 --> 00:00:55.810 
weeks and even months and this also led

00:00:55.810 --> 00:00:57.450 
weeks and even months and this also led
to<00:00:56.140> the<00:00:56.290> fact<00:00:56.500> that<00:00:56.590> we<00:00:56.770> now<00:00:56.800> added<00:00:57.190> an<00:00:57.280> extra

00:00:57.450 --> 00:00:57.460 
to the fact that we now added an extra

00:00:57.460 --> 00:00:59.700 
to the fact that we now added an extra
layer<00:00:57.820> of<00:00:57.970> control<00:00:58.420> to<00:00:58.630> your<00:00:58.750> economy<00:00:59.230> so<00:00:59.680> that

00:00:59.700 --> 00:00:59.710 
layer of control to your economy so that

00:00:59.710 --> 00:01:02.280 
layer of control to your economy so that
you<00:00:59.980> can<00:01:00.280> stay<00:01:01.150> in<00:01:01.360> control<00:01:01.690> over<00:01:02.020> your

00:01:02.280 --> 00:01:02.290 
you can stay in control over your

00:01:02.290 --> 00:01:04.649 
you can stay in control over your
economy<00:01:02.800> even<00:01:03.010> when<00:01:03.670> you<00:01:03.940> come<00:01:04.269> back<00:01:04.420> like

00:01:04.649 --> 00:01:04.659 
economy even when you come back like

00:01:04.659 --> 00:01:06.749 
economy even when you come back like
after<00:01:05.019> two<00:01:05.199> or<00:01:05.229> three<00:01:05.499> weeks<00:01:05.530> since<00:01:06.429> we<00:01:06.640> are<00:01:06.729> a

00:01:06.749 --> 00:01:06.759 
after two or three weeks since we are a

00:01:06.759 --> 00:01:08.910 
after two or three weeks since we are a
true<00:01:07.060> setlist<00:01:07.479> game<00:01:07.689> we<00:01:07.960> definitely<00:01:08.710> have<00:01:08.829> a

00:01:08.910 --> 00:01:08.920 
true setlist game we definitely have a

00:01:08.920 --> 00:01:11.309 
true setlist game we definitely have a
very<00:01:09.100> deep<00:01:09.310> and<00:01:09.520> rich<00:01:09.670> economy<00:01:10.299> and<00:01:10.569> this<00:01:11.170> will

00:01:11.309 --> 00:01:11.319 
very deep and rich economy and this will

00:01:11.319 --> 00:01:13.529 
very deep and rich economy and this will
start<00:01:11.619> with<00:01:11.950> easy<00:01:12.310> production<00:01:12.909> chains<00:01:13.179> that

00:01:13.529 --> 00:01:13.539 
start with easy production chains that

00:01:13.539 --> 00:01:15.419 
start with easy production chains that
just<00:01:13.899> feature<00:01:14.170> one<00:01:14.439> resource<00:01:14.770> deposit<00:01:15.280> in<00:01:15.399> the

00:01:15.419 --> 00:01:15.429 
just feature one resource deposit in the

00:01:15.429 --> 00:01:17.370 
just feature one resource deposit in the
gatherer<00:01:15.789> then<00:01:16.450> an<00:01:16.719> average<00:01:17.020> sized

00:01:17.370 --> 00:01:17.380 
gatherer then an average sized

00:01:17.380 --> 00:01:19.379 
gatherer then an average sized
production<00:01:17.979> chain<00:01:18.219> will<00:01:18.429> grow<00:01:18.639> up<00:01:18.670> to<00:01:19.060> nine

00:01:19.379 --> 00:01:19.389 
production chain will grow up to nine

00:01:19.389 --> 00:01:21.539 
production chain will grow up to nine
buildings<00:01:19.689> for<00:01:20.109> example<00:01:20.530> and<00:01:20.679> then<00:01:21.130> this<00:01:21.369> will

00:01:21.539 --> 00:01:21.549 
buildings for example and then this will

00:01:21.549 --> 00:01:23.580 
buildings for example and then this will
end<00:01:21.759> in<00:01:22.030> production<00:01:22.689> chains<00:01:22.960> that<00:01:23.200> can<00:01:23.409> reach

00:01:23.580 --> 00:01:23.590 
end in production chains that can reach

00:01:23.590 --> 00:01:26.340 
end in production chains that can reach
up<00:01:23.799> to<00:01:23.829> 19<00:01:24.579> different<00:01:24.909> buildings<00:01:25.509> plus<00:01:26.020> the

00:01:26.340 --> 00:01:26.350 
up to 19 different buildings plus the

00:01:26.350 --> 00:01:28.529 
up to 19 different buildings plus the
resource<00:01:26.740> deposits<00:01:27.280> so<00:01:27.670> there<00:01:27.819> is<00:01:27.939> lots<00:01:28.299> and

00:01:28.529 --> 00:01:28.539 
resource deposits so there is lots and

00:01:28.539 --> 00:01:30.179 
resource deposits so there is lots and
lots<00:01:28.719> of<00:01:28.869> possibilities<00:01:29.319> for<00:01:29.740> the<00:01:29.799> player<00:01:30.069> to

00:01:30.179 --> 00:01:30.189 
lots of possibilities for the player to

00:01:30.189 --> 00:01:32.669 
lots of possibilities for the player to
to<00:01:30.729> optimize<00:01:31.179> and<00:01:31.509> improve<00:01:31.630> his<00:01:32.109> production

00:01:32.669 --> 00:01:32.679 
to optimize and improve his production

00:01:32.679 --> 00:01:34.919 
to optimize and improve his production
and<00:01:32.829> we<00:01:33.759> invented<00:01:34.149> implemented<00:01:34.840> the

00:01:34.919 --> 00:01:34.929 
and we invented implemented the

00:01:34.929 --> 00:01:37.440 
and we invented implemented the
adventure<00:01:35.350> mode<00:01:35.530> based<00:01:36.219> mostly<00:01:36.850> on<00:01:37.060> the

00:01:37.440 --> 00:01:37.450 
adventure mode based mostly on the

00:01:37.450 --> 00:01:39.389 
adventure mode based mostly on the
feedback<00:01:37.869> we<00:01:38.020> got<00:01:38.139> from<00:01:38.200> the<00:01:38.499> players<00:01:38.709> where

00:01:39.389 --> 00:01:39.399 
feedback we got from the players where

00:01:39.399 --> 00:01:40.949 
feedback we got from the players where
we<00:01:39.490> where<00:01:39.759> they<00:01:39.880> always<00:01:40.420> said<00:01:40.630> that<00:01:40.659> they

00:01:40.949 --> 00:01:40.959 
we where they always said that they

00:01:40.959 --> 00:01:42.599 
we where they always said that they
didn't<00:01:41.229> really<00:01:41.259> like<00:01:41.619> being<00:01:41.859> pressured<00:01:42.399> and

00:01:42.599 --> 00:01:42.609 
didn't really like being pressured and

00:01:42.609 --> 00:01:44.459 
didn't really like being pressured and
that<00:01:43.209> they<00:01:43.299> could<00:01:43.479> be<00:01:43.600> attacked<00:01:43.959> in<00:01:44.200> the<00:01:44.319> while

00:01:44.459 --> 00:01:44.469 
that they could be attacked in the while

00:01:44.469 --> 00:01:46.709 
that they could be attacked in the while
they<00:01:44.740> were<00:01:45.130> building<00:01:45.310> up<00:01:45.549> their<00:01:45.729> city<00:01:46.029> so<00:01:46.600> this

00:01:46.709 --> 00:01:46.719 
they were building up their city so this

00:01:46.719 --> 00:01:48.539 
they were building up their city so this
