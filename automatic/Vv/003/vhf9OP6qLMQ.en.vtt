00:02:55.370 --> 00:02:55.380 

00:02:55.380 --> 00:03:05.050 

going<00:02:56.380> over<00:02:56.680> my<00:02:56.830> liner<00:02:57.100> again

00:03:05.050 --> 00:03:05.060 

00:03:05.060 --> 00:03:09.140

00:03:09.140 --> 00:03:09.150 
so if I was wearing wreck hell then this

00:03:09.150 --> 00:03:10.790 
so if I was wearing wreck hell then this
is<00:03:09.480> kind<00:03:09.840> of<00:03:09.870> what<00:03:10.050> it<00:03:10.110> would<00:03:10.200> be<00:03:10.380> but<00:03:10.410> I<00:03:10.620> would

00:03:10.790 --> 00:03:10.800 
is kind of what it would be but I would

00:03:10.800 --> 00:03:12.440 
is kind of what it would be but I would
