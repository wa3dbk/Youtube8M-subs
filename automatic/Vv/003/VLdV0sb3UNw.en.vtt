thing I want to tell you is the fact
that<00:00:20.789> you<00:00:21.150> don't<00:00:21.300> need<00:00:21.949> necessary<00:00:23.359> cooling

00:00:24.349 --> 00:00:24.359 
that you don't need necessary cooling

00:00:24.359 --> 00:00:29.089 
that you don't need necessary cooling

00:01:05.840 --> 00:01:05.850 
the cooling system and they can also run

00:01:05.850 --> 00:01:10.100 
the cooling system and they can also run
for<00:01:06.390> very<00:01:06.720> very<00:01:06.840> long<00:01:07.439> time<00:01:08.240> because<00:01:09.240> the

00:01:10.100 --> 00:01:10.110 
for very very long time because the

00:01:10.110 --> 00:01:12.440 
for very very long time because the
cutting<00:01:10.409> CRP<00:01:10.799> is<00:01:11.340> very<00:01:11.670> stable<00:01:12.000> and<00:01:12.390> the

00:01:12.440 --> 00:01:12.450 
cutting CRP is very stable and the

00:01:12.450 --> 00:01:14.359 
cutting CRP is very stable and the
tongue<00:01:12.600> horse<00:01:12.840> very<00:01:13.020> stable<00:01:13.350> so<00:01:13.799> I<00:01:14.010> do<00:01:14.100> not

00:01:14.359 --> 00:01:14.369 
tongue horse very stable so I do not

00:01:14.369 --> 00:01:16.999 
tongue horse very stable so I do not
want<00:01:14.580> to<00:01:14.700> take<00:01:14.850> any<00:01:15.090> risk<00:01:15.360> about<00:01:15.630> the<00:01:16.590> spindle

00:01:16.999 --> 00:01:17.009 
want to take any risk about the spindle

00:01:17.009 --> 00:01:19.100 
want to take any risk about the spindle
that<00:01:17.580> is<00:01:17.700> the<00:01:17.880> let's<00:01:18.330> say<00:01:18.509> the<00:01:18.540> hurts<00:01:18.840> of<00:01:18.990> the

00:01:19.100 --> 00:01:19.110 
that is the let's say the hurts of the

00:01:19.110 --> 00:01:22.160 
that is the let's say the hurts of the
machine<00:01:19.500> and<00:01:19.619> I<00:01:20.520> choose<00:01:20.909> a<00:01:21.420> water<00:01:21.869> cooler

00:01:22.160 --> 00:01:22.170 
machine and I choose a water cooler

00:01:22.170 --> 00:01:28.100 
machine and I choose a water cooler
spindle<00:01:22.640> so<00:01:23.640> then<00:01:24.290> as<00:01:25.290> I<00:01:26.220> was<00:01:26.900> it<00:01:27.900> was

00:01:28.100 --> 00:01:28.110 
spindle so then as I was it was

00:01:28.110 --> 00:01:30.140 
spindle so then as I was it was
necessary<00:01:28.470> to<00:01:28.560> have<00:01:28.799> a<00:01:28.829> korean<00:01:29.520> ship<00:01:29.729> it<00:01:29.909> I

00:01:30.140 --> 00:01:30.150 
necessary to have a korean ship it I

00:01:30.150 --> 00:01:33.640 
necessary to have a korean ship it I
decide<00:01:30.900> also<00:01:31.380> to<00:01:31.740> use<00:01:31.920> the<00:01:32.130> cooling<00:01:32.369> chakra<00:01:32.729> to

00:01:33.640 --> 00:01:33.650 
decide also to use the cooling chakra to

00:01:33.650 --> 00:01:37.130 
decide also to use the cooling chakra to
to<00:01:34.650> make<00:01:34.799> some<00:01:35.040> cooling<00:01:35.400> about<00:01:36.210> the<00:01:36.900> stepper

00:01:37.130 --> 00:01:37.140 
to make some cooling about the stepper

00:01:37.140 --> 00:01:40.490 
to make some cooling about the stepper
motors<00:01:37.590> so<00:01:38.340> you<00:01:38.939> have<00:01:39.090> to<00:01:39.270> know<00:01:39.420> depending<00:01:40.409> on

00:01:40.490 --> 00:01:40.500 
motors so you have to know depending on

00:01:40.500 --> 00:01:42.260 
motors so you have to know depending on
the<00:01:40.619> kind<00:01:40.829> of<00:01:40.920> whirring<00:01:41.369> you<00:01:41.700> use<00:01:41.880> on<00:01:42.210> your

00:01:42.260 --> 00:01:42.270 
the kind of whirring you use on your

00:01:42.270 --> 00:01:45.109 
the kind of whirring you use on your
step<00:01:42.659> or<00:01:42.869> especially<00:01:43.290> the<00:01:43.920> whirring<00:01:44.340> high<00:01:44.939> use

00:01:45.109 --> 00:01:45.119 
step or especially the whirring high use

00:01:45.119 --> 00:01:48.859 
step or especially the whirring high use
here<00:01:45.420> is<00:01:45.689> the<00:01:45.899> parallel<00:01:46.380> walling<00:01:47.750> so<00:01:48.750> the

00:01:48.859 --> 00:01:48.869 
here is the parallel walling so the

00:01:48.869 --> 00:01:51.620 
here is the parallel walling so the
talker<00:01:49.110> stepper<00:01:49.590> is<00:01:49.799> very<00:01:50.009> high<00:01:50.220> but<00:01:51.000> also<00:01:51.210> a

00:01:51.620 --> 00:01:51.630 
talker stepper is very high but also a

00:01:51.630 --> 00:01:53.179 
talker stepper is very high but also a
you<00:01:51.840> increase<00:01:52.200> the<00:01:52.290> temperature<00:01:52.320> and<00:01:52.890> you

00:01:53.179 --> 00:01:53.189 
you increase the temperature and you

00:01:53.189 --> 00:01:55.639 
you increase the temperature and you
cannot<00:01:53.369> have<00:01:53.610> a<00:01:53.640> temperature<00:01:54.090> about<00:01:54.649> 80

00:01:55.639 --> 00:01:55.649 
cannot have a temperature about 80

00:01:55.649 --> 00:02:01.249 
cannot have a temperature about 80
Celsius<00:01:56.369> degrees<00:01:57.119> so<00:01:57.689> I<00:01:57.960> put<00:01:58.950> on<00:01:59.159> each<00:01:59.780> of<00:02:00.780> my

00:02:01.249 --> 00:02:01.259 
Celsius degrees so I put on each of my

00:02:01.259 --> 00:02:03.830 
Celsius degrees so I put on each of my
stepper<00:02:01.820> a<00:02:02.820> coil

00:02:03.830 --> 00:02:03.840 
stepper a coil

00:02:03.840 --> 00:02:07.850 
stepper a coil
it's<00:02:03.990> a<00:02:04.460> it's<00:02:05.460> a<00:02:05.790> coil<00:02:06.180> that<00:02:06.840> I<00:02:07.170> create<00:02:07.649> from

00:02:07.850 --> 00:02:07.860 
it's a it's a coil that I create from

00:02:07.860 --> 00:02:09.200 
it's a it's a coil that I create from
from

00:02:09.200 --> 00:02:09.210 
from

00:02:09.210 --> 00:02:16.070 
from
a<00:02:10.550> small<00:02:11.550> pipe<00:02:11.820> of<00:02:12.260> and<00:02:13.260> I<00:02:14.450> turn<00:02:15.450> it<00:02:15.630> around<00:02:15.750> the

00:02:16.070 --> 00:02:16.080 
a small pipe of and I turn it around the

00:02:16.080 --> 00:02:18.950 
a small pipe of and I turn it around the
stepper<00:02:16.530> so<00:02:16.890> I<00:02:17.160> create<00:02:17.580> a<00:02:17.610> coil<00:02:17.850> and<00:02:18.000> I<00:02:18.780> used

00:02:18.950 --> 00:02:18.960 
stepper so I create a coil and I used

00:02:18.960 --> 00:02:21.710 
stepper so I create a coil and I used
the<00:02:19.140> de<00:02:19.260> Kooning<00:02:19.410> Peter<00:02:19.950> so<00:02:20.160> to<00:02:20.330> maintain<00:02:21.330> a

00:02:21.710 --> 00:02:21.720 
the de Kooning Peter so to maintain a

00:02:21.720 --> 00:02:26.180 
the de Kooning Peter so to maintain a
good<00:02:21.930> dancer<00:02:22.380> on<00:02:22.590> the<00:02:22.740> steppers<00:02:23.190> so<00:02:24.770> now<00:02:25.770> I'm

00:02:26.180 --> 00:02:26.190 
good dancer on the steppers so now I'm

00:02:26.190 --> 00:02:30.040 
good dancer on the steppers so now I'm
very<00:02:26.820> pleased<00:02:27.600> with<00:02:27.870> that<00:02:28.290> solution<00:02:28.590> because

00:02:30.040 --> 00:02:30.050 
very pleased with that solution because

00:02:30.050 --> 00:02:34.070 
very pleased with that solution because
I<00:02:31.220> can<00:02:32.220> feel<00:02:32.430> that<00:02:32.610> the<00:02:32.940> tonsure<00:02:33.300> would<00:02:33.900> be

00:02:34.070 --> 00:02:34.080 
I can feel that the tonsure would be

00:02:34.080 --> 00:02:34.790 
I can feel that the tonsure would be
very<00:02:34.320> high

00:02:34.790 --> 00:02:34.800 
very high

00:02:34.800 --> 00:02:38.210 
very high
without<00:02:35.100> this<00:02:35.460> system<00:02:35.640> and<00:02:36.030> maybe<00:02:36.470> I<00:02:37.470> could

00:02:38.210 --> 00:02:38.220 
without this system and maybe I could

00:02:38.220 --> 00:02:44.000 
without this system and maybe I could
have<00:02:38.460> burned<00:02:38.910> my<00:02:39.300> my<00:02:39.990> stepper<00:02:40.320> motors<00:02:42.830> so<00:02:43.830> when

00:02:44.000 --> 00:02:44.010 
have burned my my stepper motors so when

00:02:44.010 --> 00:02:46.700 
have burned my my stepper motors so when
I<00:02:44.040> decide<00:02:44.400> to<00:02:44.430> to<00:02:44.730> have<00:02:44.910> the<00:02:45.900> Korean<00:02:46.170> circuit<00:02:46.500> I

00:02:46.700 --> 00:02:46.710 
I decide to to have the Korean circuit I

00:02:46.710 --> 00:02:53.180 
I decide to to have the Korean circuit I
create<00:02:49.910> design<00:02:50.910> of<00:02:51.030> the<00:02:51.120> circuit<00:02:51.270> and<00:02:52.190> there

00:02:53.180 --> 00:02:53.190 
create design of the circuit and there

00:02:53.190 --> 00:02:55.880 
create design of the circuit and there
is<00:02:53.310> two<00:02:53.640> of<00:02:53.670> three<00:02:54.540> things<00:02:54.960> about<00:02:55.260> the

00:02:55.880 --> 00:02:55.890 
is two of three things about the

00:02:55.890 --> 00:02:57.770 
is two of three things about the
settings<00:02:56.310> that<00:02:56.460> you<00:02:56.610> have<00:02:56.820> to<00:02:56.940> know<00:02:57.060> the<00:02:57.510> first

00:02:57.770 --> 00:02:57.780 
settings that you have to know the first

00:02:57.780 --> 00:03:01.580 
settings that you have to know the first
one<00:02:57.990> I<00:02:58.200> use<00:02:58.620> an<00:02:58.890> automotive<00:02:59.220> tank<00:03:00.050> like<00:03:01.050> this

00:03:01.580 --> 00:03:01.590 
one I use an automotive tank like this

00:03:01.590 --> 00:03:05.870 
one I use an automotive tank like this
one<00:03:01.920> and<00:03:02.240> it<00:03:03.240> has<00:03:03.270> two<00:03:04.260> advantages<00:03:04.770> the<00:03:05.640> first

00:03:05.870 --> 00:03:05.880 
one and it has two advantages the first

00:03:05.880 --> 00:03:11.030 
one and it has two advantages the first
one<00:03:06.150> is<00:03:06.990> the<00:03:07.110> fact<00:03:07.290> that<00:03:07.410> you<00:03:07.710> have<00:03:09.320> some<00:03:10.320> some

00:03:11.030 --> 00:03:11.040 
one is the fact that you have some some

00:03:11.040 --> 00:03:14.710 
one is the fact that you have some some
reserve<00:03:11.520> and<00:03:11.840> some<00:03:12.840> advanced<00:03:13.350> cooling<00:03:14.280> and

00:03:14.710 --> 00:03:14.720 
reserve and some advanced cooling and

00:03:14.720 --> 00:03:18.200 
reserve and some advanced cooling and
also<00:03:15.720> the<00:03:16.170> fact<00:03:16.350> that<00:03:16.440> if<00:03:16.860> you<00:03:17.220> are<00:03:17.400> if<00:03:17.790> you

00:03:18.200 --> 00:03:18.210 
also the fact that if you are if you

00:03:18.210 --> 00:03:21.050 
also the fact that if you are if you
have<00:03:18.270> some<00:03:18.750> bubbles<00:03:19.230> or<00:03:19.470> air<00:03:19.800> inside<00:03:20.340> the

00:03:21.050 --> 00:03:21.060 
have some bubbles or air inside the

00:03:21.060 --> 00:03:24.560 
have some bubbles or air inside the
circuits<00:03:21.540> this<00:03:22.110> kind<00:03:22.440> of<00:03:22.530> bottle<00:03:23.040> is<00:03:23.580> able<00:03:24.270> to

00:03:24.560 --> 00:03:24.570 
circuits this kind of bottle is able to

00:03:24.570 --> 00:03:27.650 
circuits this kind of bottle is able to
remove<00:03:24.900> the<00:03:25.890> air<00:03:26.130> inside<00:03:26.910> the<00:03:27.360> cooling

00:03:27.650 --> 00:03:27.660 
remove the air inside the cooling

00:03:27.660 --> 00:03:34.040 
remove the air inside the cooling
circuit<00:03:27.840> and<00:03:28.230> I<00:03:29.070> put<00:03:29.550> in<00:03:29.850> the<00:03:30.090> upper<00:03:30.390> way<00:03:30.920> so<00:03:33.050> at

00:03:34.040 --> 00:03:34.050 
circuit and I put in the upper way so at

00:03:34.050 --> 00:03:36.380 
circuit and I put in the upper way so at
the<00:03:34.260> maximum<00:03:34.890> height<00:03:35.130> of<00:03:35.190> the<00:03:35.550> of<00:03:35.850> the<00:03:36.000> machine

00:03:36.380 --> 00:03:36.390 
the maximum height of the of the machine

00:03:36.390 --> 00:03:40.310 
the maximum height of the of the machine
so<00:03:36.960> I'm<00:03:37.110> sure<00:03:37.350> that<00:03:37.560> the<00:03:38.520> cooling<00:03:39.300> Frieda<00:03:39.600> is

00:03:40.310 --> 00:03:40.320 
so I'm sure that the cooling Frieda is

00:03:40.320 --> 00:03:45.320 
so I'm sure that the cooling Frieda is
getting<00:03:41.070> down<00:03:42.320> then<00:03:43.320> I<00:03:43.760> when<00:03:44.760> I<00:03:44.790> create<00:03:45.300> a

00:03:45.320 --> 00:03:45.330 
getting down then I when I create a

00:03:45.330 --> 00:03:45.890 
getting down then I when I create a
design

00:03:45.890 --> 00:03:45.900 
design

00:03:45.900 --> 00:03:50.530 
design
I<00:03:45.930> put<00:03:46.790> the<00:03:47.790> pump<00:03:48.090> in<00:03:48.450> a<00:03:48.750> lower<00:03:48.960> position<00:03:49.770> and

00:03:50.530 --> 00:03:50.540 
I put the pump in a lower position and

00:03:50.540 --> 00:03:54.620 
I put the pump in a lower position and
you<00:03:51.540> can<00:03:51.780> see<00:03:52.050> also<00:03:52.170> on<00:03:52.380> the<00:03:53.000> on<00:03:54.000> this<00:03:54.210> design

00:03:54.620 --> 00:03:54.630 
you can see also on the on this design

00:03:54.630 --> 00:03:56.090 
you can see also on the on this design
so<00:03:55.050> the<00:03:55.170> code<00:03:55.380> for<00:03:55.410> the<00:03:55.650> stepper

00:03:56.090 --> 00:03:56.100 
so the code for the stepper

00:03:56.100 --> 00:04:00.370 
so the code for the stepper
so<00:03:56.400> for<00:03:56.700> each<00:03:56.850> stepper<00:03:57.210> and<00:03:58.490> so<00:03:59.490> the<00:03:59.550> freedom

00:04:00.370 --> 00:04:00.380 
so for each stepper and so the freedom

00:04:00.380 --> 00:04:05.330 
so for each stepper and so the freedom
go<00:04:01.380> also<00:04:01.680> inside<00:04:02.190> and<00:04:02.760> I<00:04:03.120> use<00:04:03.270> also<00:04:04.340> radiator

00:04:05.330 --> 00:04:05.340 
go also inside and I use also radiator

00:04:05.340 --> 00:04:07.370 
go also inside and I use also radiator

the coding freed is is running inside
the<00:04:27.000> CIP<00:04:28.910> there<00:04:29.910> is<00:04:30.030> two<00:04:30.650> other<00:04:31.650> thing<00:04:32.100> that<00:04:32.310> I

00:04:32.630 --> 00:04:32.640 
the CIP there is two other thing that I

00:04:32.640 --> 00:04:40.190 
the CIP there is two other thing that I
should<00:04:33.000> mention<00:04:33.740> so<00:04:35.720> the<00:04:36.720> first<00:04:36.990> one<00:04:37.320> you<00:04:39.200> can

00:04:40.190 --> 00:04:40.200 
should mention so the first one you can

00:04:40.200 --> 00:04:43.550 
should mention so the first one you can
see<00:04:40.440> here<00:04:41.600> the<00:04:42.600> flow<00:04:42.840> meter

the Tantra of the freedom after the
motorbike<00:05:14.730> radiator<00:05:15.690> and<00:05:16.050> I<00:05:16.950> use<00:05:17.490> this<00:05:18.090> device

00:05:18.350 --> 00:05:18.360 
motorbike radiator and I use this device

00:05:18.360 --> 00:05:22.970 
motorbike radiator and I use this device
to<00:05:20.210> make<00:05:21.210> the<00:05:21.480> fan<00:05:21.690> running<00:05:21.900> or<00:05:22.200> not<00:05:22.230> depending

00:05:22.970 --> 00:05:22.980 
to make the fan running or not depending

00:05:22.980 --> 00:05:26.450 
to make the fan running or not depending
of<00:05:23.190> the<00:05:23.220> Tantra<00:05:23.790> of<00:05:24.450> the<00:05:25.110> LD<00:05:25.800> of<00:05:26.040> the<00:05:26.190> freed

00:05:26.450 --> 00:05:26.460 
of the Tantra of the LD of the freed

00:05:26.460 --> 00:05:28.490 
of the Tantra of the LD of the freed
outside<00:05:26.940> of<00:05:27.150> the<00:05:27.270> radiator<00:05:27.630> so<00:05:28.080> it's<00:05:28.230> a<00:05:28.350> good

00:05:28.490 --> 00:05:28.500 
outside of the radiator so it's a good

00:05:28.500 --> 00:05:32.240 
outside of the radiator so it's a good
way<00:05:28.740> to<00:05:28.770> maintain<00:05:29.130> a<00:05:29.550> very<00:05:30.980> very<00:05:31.980> stable

00:05:32.240 --> 00:05:32.250 
way to maintain a very very stable

00:05:32.250 --> 00:05:37.040 
way to maintain a very very stable
temperature<00:05:32.820> and<00:05:33.030> to<00:05:33.630> grab<00:05:33.870> a<00:05:34.020> very<00:05:36.050> cooling

00:05:37.040 --> 00:05:37.050 
temperature and to grab a very cooling

00:05:37.050 --> 00:05:41.210 
temperature and to grab a very cooling
efficiency<00:05:37.970> so<00:05:38.970> I<00:05:39.590> can<00:05:40.590> show<00:05:40.770> you<00:05:40.860> the<00:05:40.980> pump

00:05:41.210 --> 00:05:41.220 
efficiency so I can show you the pump

00:05:41.220 --> 00:05:46.340 
efficiency so I can show you the pump
it's<00:05:41.730> the<00:05:42.060> down<00:05:42.930> side<00:05:43.320> of<00:05:43.350> the<00:05:43.560> machine<00:05:45.020> and<00:05:46.020> we

00:05:46.340 --> 00:05:46.350 
it's the down side of the machine and we

00:05:46.350 --> 00:05:51.679 
it's the down side of the machine and we
have<00:05:47.060> to<00:05:48.060> go

00:05:51.679 --> 00:05:51.689 

00:05:51.689 --> 00:05:54.529 

under<00:05:52.409> the<00:05:52.469> machine<00:05:52.889> so<00:05:53.610> you<00:05:53.909> have<00:05:54.179> the<00:05:54.330> pump

00:05:54.529 --> 00:05:54.539 
under the machine so you have the pump

00:05:54.539 --> 00:05:57.379 
under the machine so you have the pump
here<00:05:54.899> and<00:05:55.110> the<00:05:55.349> pump<00:05:55.729> starting<00:05:56.729> each<00:05:56.939> time<00:05:57.239> you

00:05:57.379 --> 00:05:57.389 
here and the pump starting each time you

00:05:57.389 --> 00:05:59.869 
here and the pump starting each time you
start<00:05:57.629> a<00:05:57.779> spindle<00:05:58.169> so<00:05:58.739> one<00:05:58.919> linuxcnc<00:05:59.309> is

00:05:59.869 --> 00:05:59.879 
start a spindle so one linuxcnc is

00:05:59.879 --> 00:06:03.469 
start a spindle so one linuxcnc is
sending<00:06:00.439> the<00:06:01.439> spindle<00:06:01.919> signal<00:06:02.339> to<00:06:02.489> start<00:06:02.729> the

00:06:03.469 --> 00:06:03.479 
sending the spindle signal to start the

00:06:03.479 --> 00:06:06.049 
sending the spindle signal to start the
pump<00:06:03.749> received<00:06:04.379> the<00:06:04.499> signal<00:06:05.159> also<00:06:05.429> and<00:06:05.789> start

00:06:06.049 --> 00:06:06.059 
pump received the signal also and start

00:06:06.059 --> 00:06:10.339 
pump received the signal also and start
and<00:06:06.979> so<00:06:07.979> the<00:06:08.279> pump<00:06:08.549> is<00:06:08.789> as<00:06:09.389> you<00:06:09.539> can<00:06:09.719> see<00:06:09.929> at<00:06:10.169> the

00:06:10.339 --> 00:06:10.349 
and so the pump is as you can see at the

00:06:10.349 --> 00:06:12.229 
and so the pump is as you can see at the
lower<00:06:10.499> position<00:06:11.159> so<00:06:11.369> receive<00:06:11.669> the<00:06:11.789> freedom

00:06:12.229 --> 00:06:12.239 
lower position so receive the freedom

00:06:12.239 --> 00:06:15.289 
lower position so receive the freedom
and<00:06:12.360> there<00:06:12.899> is<00:06:13.049> no<00:06:13.199> way<00:06:13.439> that<00:06:13.709> air<00:06:14.459> can<00:06:14.939> be

00:06:15.289 --> 00:06:15.299 
and there is no way that air can be

00:06:15.299 --> 00:06:18.709 
and there is no way that air can be
stuck<00:06:15.569> there<00:06:16.079> and<00:06:16.459> just<00:06:17.459> down<00:06:17.729> you<00:06:18.239> can<00:06:18.479> see

00:06:18.709 --> 00:06:18.719 
stuck there and just down you can see

00:06:18.719 --> 00:06:22.009 
stuck there and just down you can see
here<00:06:19.489> the<00:06:20.489> the<00:06:20.849> radiator<00:06:21.269> or<00:06:21.449> the<00:06:21.479> motorbike

00:06:22.009 --> 00:06:22.019 
here the the radiator or the motorbike

00:06:22.019 --> 00:06:25.939 
here the the radiator or the motorbike
radiator<00:06:22.489> and<00:06:23.489> the<00:06:23.789> black<00:06:24.199> vehicle<00:06:25.199> here<00:06:25.439> is

00:06:25.939 --> 00:06:25.949 
radiator and the black vehicle here is

00:06:25.949 --> 00:06:28.729 
radiator and the black vehicle here is
the<00:06:26.279> fan<00:06:26.550> that<00:06:27.179> is<00:06:27.329> used<00:06:27.599> to<00:06:27.929> control<00:06:28.469> the

00:06:28.729 --> 00:06:28.739 
the fan that is used to control the

00:06:28.739 --> 00:06:32.809 
the fan that is used to control the
temperature<00:06:29.159> and<00:06:29.699> the<00:06:30.389> sensor<00:06:30.809> Tom<00:06:31.739> TRO<00:06:32.009> of

00:06:32.809 --> 00:06:32.819 
temperature and the sensor Tom TRO of

00:06:32.819 --> 00:06:36.469 
temperature and the sensor Tom TRO of
the<00:06:32.969> returning<00:06:33.300> field<00:06:33.689> is<00:06:33.869> there<00:06:34.259> so<00:06:35.479> with

00:06:36.469 --> 00:06:36.479 
the returning field is there so with

00:06:36.479 --> 00:06:40.309 
the returning field is there so with
this<00:06:36.959> way<00:06:37.259> I<00:06:37.499> can<00:06:38.219> control<00:06:38.729> all<00:06:39.539> the<00:06:40.050> cooling

00:06:40.309 --> 00:06:40.319 
this way I can control all the cooling

00:06:40.319 --> 00:06:43.879 
this way I can control all the cooling
secrets<00:06:40.769> and<00:06:40.979> I<00:06:41.519> can<00:06:41.849> work<00:06:42.059> for<00:06:42.389> hours<00:06:43.229> hours

00:06:43.879 --> 00:06:43.889 
secrets and I can work for hours hours

00:06:43.889 --> 00:06:50.149 
secrets and I can work for hours hours
with<00:06:45.469> about<00:06:46.669> the<00:06:47.669> the<00:06:48.089> CNC<00:06:48.739> spindle<00:06:49.739> don't<00:06:49.979> err

00:06:50.149 --> 00:06:50.159 
with about the the CNC spindle don't err

00:06:50.159 --> 00:06:55.549 
with about the the CNC spindle don't err
and<00:06:50.610> so<00:06:51.089> on<00:06:51.829> so<00:06:52.829> here<00:06:53.009> it<00:06:53.129> is<00:06:53.279> so<00:06:54.229> the<00:06:55.229> cooling

00:06:55.549 --> 00:06:55.559 
and so on so here it is so the cooling

00:06:55.559 --> 00:06:59.059 
and so on so here it is so the cooling
circuit<00:06:55.769> and<00:06:56.389> why<00:06:57.389> I<00:06:57.749> use<00:06:58.079> a<00:06:58.110> purchasing

00:06:59.059 --> 00:06:59.069 
circuit and why I use a purchasing

00:06:59.069 --> 00:07:06.710 
circuit and why I use a purchasing
thanks<00:06:59.819> for<00:06:59.939> watching
