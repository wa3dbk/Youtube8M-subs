beachball<00:02:42.170> zone<00:02:42.680> right<00:02:43.610> Prime<00:02:44.269> this<00:02:44.840> toy<00:02:45.170> is

00:02:45.400 --> 00:02:45.410 
beachball zone right Prime this toy is

00:02:45.410 --> 00:02:49.570 
beachball zone right Prime this toy is
so<00:02:46.599> brilliant<00:02:47.599> it's<00:02:48.260> easily<00:02:48.860> the<00:02:48.980> best<00:02:49.220> prime

00:02:49.570 --> 00:02:49.580 
so brilliant it's easily the best prime

00:02:49.580 --> 00:02:52.210 
so brilliant it's easily the best prime
it's<00:02:50.120> better<00:02:50.420> than<00:02:50.599> G<00:02:50.810> 1<00:02:51.049> prime<00:02:51.379> and<00:02:51.650> only<00:02:52.040> pick

better than any other prime you care to

00:02:59.360 --> 00:03:01.270 
better than any other prime you care to
think<00:02:59.540> of<00:02:59.690> that's<00:03:00.049> my<00:03:00.470> opinion<00:03:00.739> now<00:03:01.010> you<00:03:01.069> know

00:03:01.270 --> 00:03:01.280 
think of that's my opinion now you know

00:03:01.280 --> 00:03:03.369 
think of that's my opinion now you know
it<00:03:01.400> goes<00:03:01.519> into<00:03:01.670> a<00:03:01.760> fire<00:03:02.000> truck<00:03:02.239> so<00:03:02.540> no<00:03:03.080> prizes

00:03:03.369 --> 00:03:03.379 
it goes into a fire truck so no prizes

00:03:03.379 --> 00:03:05.650 
it goes into a fire truck so no prizes
for<00:03:03.590> guessing<00:03:03.709> that<00:03:04.129> the<00:03:04.610> toy<00:03:04.849> is<00:03:05.150> very

00:03:05.650 --> 00:03:05.660 
for guessing that the toy is very

00:03:05.660 --> 00:03:07.860 
for guessing that the toy is very
articulate<00:03:06.260> bit<00:03:06.410> of<00:03:06.500> the<00:03:06.560> movie<00:03:06.829> Prime<00:03:07.040> to

00:03:15.850 --> 00:03:15.860 
big transformer a nice bit of toy for

00:03:15.860 --> 00:03:17.920 
big transformer a nice bit of toy for
your<00:03:16.010> money<00:03:16.190> the<00:03:16.370> transformation<00:03:17.209> is<00:03:17.420> quite

00:03:17.920 --> 00:03:17.930 
your money the transformation is quite

00:03:17.930 --> 00:03:20.410 
your money the transformation is quite
good<00:03:18.620> it's<00:03:19.370> a<00:03:19.549> bit<00:03:19.700> fiddly<00:03:19.970> because<00:03:20.269> you<00:03:20.329> have

of<00:04:11.290> a<00:04:11.379> toy<00:04:11.560> he's<00:04:12.010> massive<00:04:12.580> I<00:04:12.700> wish<00:04:12.879> I'd<00:04:13.000> had<00:04:13.180> two

00:04:13.619 --> 00:04:13.629 
of a toy he's massive I wish I'd had two

00:04:13.629 --> 00:04:15.240 
of a toy he's massive I wish I'd had two
of<00:04:13.780> each<00:04:13.900> so<00:04:14.230> I<00:04:14.290> can<00:04:14.500> have<00:04:14.590> one<00:04:14.620> combined<00:04:15.129> as

00:04:15.240 --> 00:04:15.250 
of each so I can have one combined as

00:04:15.250 --> 00:04:16.199 
of each so I can have one combined as
and<00:04:15.340> make<00:04:15.430> a<00:04:15.459> prime<00:04:15.700> and<00:04:15.879> then<00:04:16.000> we<00:04:16.090> need

00:04:16.199 --> 00:04:16.209 
and make a prime and then we need

00:04:16.209 --> 00:04:18.240 
and make a prime and then we need
displayed<00:04:16.870> individually<00:04:17.440> and<00:04:17.919> they're<00:04:18.070> mine

00:04:18.240 --> 00:04:18.250 
displayed individually and they're mine

00:04:18.250 --> 00:04:20.819 
displayed individually and they're mine
okay<00:04:18.639> got<00:04:19.209> a<00:04:19.269> fuel<00:04:19.750> tank<00:04:20.019> in<00:04:20.139> battle<00:04:20.410> station

00:04:20.819 --> 00:04:20.829 
okay got a fuel tank in battle station

00:04:20.829 --> 00:04:22.650 
okay got a fuel tank in battle station
which<00:04:21.070> the<00:04:21.280> bits<00:04:21.459> fall<00:04:21.669> off<00:04:21.850> and<00:04:22.000> make<00:04:22.240> i'll

00:04:22.650 --> 00:04:22.660 
which the bits fall off and make i'll

00:04:22.660 --> 00:04:23.820 
which the bits fall off and make i'll
show<00:04:22.840> you<00:04:22.900> the<00:04:23.050> beginning<00:04:23.320> now<00:04:23.500> if<00:04:23.560> i<00:04:23.680> can

right now I can't remember exactly how

00:04:48.070 --> 00:04:50.279 
right now I can't remember exactly how
it<00:04:48.220> goes<00:04:48.400> so<00:04:48.669> I'm<00:04:48.850> guessing<00:04:49.090> I<00:04:49.510> never<00:04:50.110> do

00:04:50.279 --> 00:04:50.289 
it goes so I'm guessing I never do

00:04:50.289 --> 00:04:52.379 
it goes so I'm guessing I never do
transformations<00:04:51.010> on<00:04:51.220> in<00:04:51.850> front<00:04:52.090> of<00:04:52.180> people
