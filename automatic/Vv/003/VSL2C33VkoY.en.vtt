00:00:01.150 --> 00:00:05.190 

this<00:00:01.780> is<00:00:01.990> the<00:00:02.110> temperature<00:00:02.790> on<00:00:03.990> the<00:00:04.990> cell

00:00:05.190 --> 00:00:05.200 
this is the temperature on the cell

00:00:05.200 --> 00:00:13.829 
this is the temperature on the cell
right<00:00:05.440> now<00:00:07.200> that's<00:00:08.200> the<00:00:08.380> oxygen<00:00:08.530> side<00:00:12.839> there

00:00:13.829 --> 00:00:13.839 
right now that's the oxygen side there

00:00:13.839 --> 00:00:21.240 
right now that's the oxygen side there
the<00:00:14.079> output<00:00:14.469> of<00:00:14.499> the<00:00:14.799> gases

00:00:21.240 --> 00:00:21.250 

00:00:21.250 --> 00:00:26.650 

there's<00:00:21.820> production<00:00:22.420> of<00:00:22.539> the<00:00:22.660> gasses

00:00:26.650 --> 00:00:26.660 

00:00:26.660 --> 00:00:30.770 

they're<00:00:27.660> the<00:00:27.840> oxygen

00:00:30.770 --> 00:00:30.780 

00:00:30.780 --> 00:00:36.330 

again<00:00:31.500> there's<00:00:31.770> the<00:00:31.920> temperature

00:00:36.330 --> 00:00:36.340 

00:00:36.340 --> 00:00:39.530 

that's<00:00:36.880> our<00:00:37.060> optimum<00:00:37.600> operating<00:00:38.080> range<00:00:38.380> and

00:00:39.530 --> 00:00:39.540 
that's our optimum operating range and

00:00:39.540 --> 00:00:42.930 
that's our optimum operating range and
if<00:00:40.540> you'll<00:00:40.690> notice<00:00:41.400> that<00:00:42.400> we<00:00:42.580> have<00:00:42.730> dropped

00:00:42.930 --> 00:00:42.940 
if you'll notice that we have dropped

00:00:42.940 --> 00:00:45.840 
if you'll notice that we have dropped
down<00:00:43.180> from<00:00:43.240> 20<00:00:43.990> volts<00:00:44.380> 20<00:00:45.160> amps<00:00:45.430> I'm<00:00:45.610> sorry

00:00:45.840 --> 00:00:45.850 
down from 20 volts 20 amps I'm sorry

00:00:45.850 --> 00:00:51.140 
down from 20 volts 20 amps I'm sorry
down<00:00:46.690> to<00:00:46.960> 12<00:00:47.490> and<00:00:48.490> that<00:00:48.790> we're<00:00:49.090> at<00:00:49.180> 15<00:00:49.600> volts

00:00:51.140 --> 00:00:51.150 
down to 12 and that we're at 15 volts

00:00:51.150 --> 00:00:54.270 
down to 12 and that we're at 15 volts
this<00:00:52.150> is<00:00:52.360> the<00:00:52.480> optimum<00:00:52.960> temperature<00:00:53.350> of<00:00:53.920> our

00:00:54.270 --> 00:00:54.280 
this is the optimum temperature of our

00:00:54.280 --> 00:00:55.860 
this is the optimum temperature of our
cell<00:00:54.520> in<00:00:54.790> operation

00:00:55.860 --> 00:00:55.870 
cell in operation

00:00:55.870 --> 00:01:05.460 
cell in operation
I<00:00:58.500> will<00:00:59.500> then<00:00:59.710> again<00:01:00.010> demonstrate<00:01:03.930> the<00:01:04.930> oxygen

00:01:05.460 --> 00:01:05.470 
I will then again demonstrate the oxygen

00:01:05.470 --> 00:01:17.250 
I will then again demonstrate the oxygen
burn<00:01:07.410> hydrogen<00:01:08.410> burn<00:01:11.010> the<00:01:12.010> hydrogen<00:01:12.490> burn

00:01:17.250 --> 00:01:17.260 

00:01:17.260 --> 00:01:20.970 

to<00:01:17.770> sell<00:01:18.010> in<00:01:18.190> full<00:01:18.400> operation<00:01:19.980> at

00:01:20.970 --> 00:01:20.980 
to sell in full operation at

00:01:20.980 --> 00:01:27.780 
to sell in full operation at
approximately<00:01:24.360> 12<00:01:25.360> to<00:01:25.540> 13<00:01:25.930> amps<00:01:26.320> and<00:01:26.530> at<00:01:27.340> 15

00:01:27.780 --> 00:01:27.790 
approximately 12 to 13 amps and at 15

00:01:27.790 --> 00:01:28.320 
approximately 12 to 13 amps and at 15
volts

00:01:28.320 --> 00:01:28.330 
volts

00:01:28.330 --> 00:01:32.340 
volts
I<00:01:29.490> would<00:01:30.490> like<00:01:30.640> to<00:01:30.670> hydrogen<00:01:31.600> again<00:01:31.990> so<00:01:32.260> you

00:01:32.340 --> 00:01:32.350 
I would like to hydrogen again so you

00:01:32.350 --> 00:01:38.889 
I would like to hydrogen again so you
can<00:01:32.470> see<00:01:32.530> it<00:01:32.740> from<00:01:32.890> above

00:01:38.889 --> 00:01:38.899 

00:01:38.899 --> 00:01:43.139 

there's<00:01:39.469> the<00:01:39.649> cell<00:01:39.859> it's<00:01:40.070> very<00:01:40.310> aggressive

00:01:43.139 --> 00:01:43.149 

00:01:43.149 --> 00:01:45.399 

generating<00:01:44.149> is<00:01:44.270> hydrogen<00:01:44.600> and<00:01:45.109> it's

00:01:45.399 --> 00:01:45.409 
generating is hydrogen and it's

00:01:45.409 --> 00:01:47.200 
generating is hydrogen and it's
generating<00:01:45.950> its<00:01:46.070> oxygen<00:01:46.549> you<00:01:46.670> can<00:01:46.700> see<00:01:46.969> both

00:01:47.200 --> 00:01:47.210 
generating its oxygen you can see both

00:01:47.210 --> 00:01:53.700 
generating its oxygen you can see both
of<00:01:47.240> them<00:01:47.509> running

00:01:53.700 --> 00:01:53.710 

00:01:53.710 --> 00:01:55.530 

and<00:01:53.800> this<00:01:54.460> is<00:01:54.610> the<00:01:54.730> normal<00:01:54.880> operating

00:01:55.530 --> 00:01:55.540 
and this is the normal operating

00:01:55.540 --> 00:01:59.310 
and this is the normal operating
temperature<00:01:55.630> of<00:01:56.230> our<00:01:56.410> cell<00:01:56.710> and<00:01:57.750> again<00:01:58.750> this

00:01:59.310 --> 00:01:59.320 
temperature of our cell and again this

00:01:59.320 --> 00:02:09.730 
temperature of our cell and again this
is<00:01:59.500> the<00:01:59.620> pure<00:01:59.830> hydrogen

00:02:09.730 --> 00:02:09.740 

00:02:09.740 --> 00:02:28.450 

production<00:02:11.500> production<00:02:14.590> oxygen<00:02:16.390> hydrogen

00:02:28.450 --> 00:02:28.460 

00:02:28.460 --> 00:02:30.710 

gases<00:02:29.460> are<00:02:29.610> completely<00:02:30.150> separate<00:02:30.480> from<00:02:30.690> each

00:02:30.710 --> 00:02:30.720 
gases are completely separate from each

00:02:30.720 --> 00:02:32.809 
gases are completely separate from each
other

00:02:32.809 --> 00:02:32.819
