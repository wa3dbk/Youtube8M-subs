00:00:06.980 --> 00:00:06.990 
right we're getting ready to hook up to

00:00:06.990 --> 00:00:09.919 
right we're getting ready to hook up to
this<00:00:07.290> 10<00:00:07.589> series<00:00:08.099> tiller<00:00:08.429> this<00:00:08.760> is<00:00:08.910> a<00:00:08.940> 66<00:00:09.630> inch

this 10 series tiller this is a 66 inch

00:00:09.929 --> 00:00:12.140 
this 10 series tiller this is a 66 inch
wide<00:00:10.200> and<00:00:10.559> just<00:00:11.160> to<00:00:11.250> point<00:00:11.429> out<00:00:11.639> a<00:00:11.670> couple<00:00:11.790> of

00:00:12.140 --> 00:00:12.150 
wide and just to point out a couple of

00:00:12.150 --> 00:00:14.180 
wide and just to point out a couple of
things<00:00:12.300> for<00:00:12.540> we<00:00:12.660> get<00:00:12.809> hook<00:00:13.049> to<00:00:13.290> it<00:00:13.320> this<00:00:13.950> is<00:00:14.009> a

00:00:14.180 --> 00:00:14.190 
things for we get hook to it this is a

00:00:14.190 --> 00:00:16.189 
things for we get hook to it this is a
clevis<00:00:14.549> hitch<00:00:14.880> here<00:00:15.240> where<00:00:15.450> your<00:00:15.599> lift<00:00:15.780> arm<00:00:16.049> is

00:00:16.189 --> 00:00:16.199 
clevis hitch here where your lift arm is

00:00:16.199 --> 00:00:18.019 
clevis hitch here where your lift arm is
going<00:00:16.320> to<00:00:16.410> go<00:00:16.590> it's<00:00:16.800> fully<00:00:17.070> adjustable<00:00:17.250> either

00:00:18.019 --> 00:00:18.029 
going to go it's fully adjustable either

00:00:18.029 --> 00:00:19.760 
going to go it's fully adjustable either
way<00:00:18.300> so<00:00:18.359> you<00:00:18.690> can<00:00:18.840> make<00:00:19.020> it<00:00:19.140> fit<00:00:19.320> about<00:00:19.439> any

00:00:19.760 --> 00:00:19.770 
way so you can make it fit about any

00:00:19.770 --> 00:00:22.670 
way so you can make it fit about any
tractor<00:00:20.340> and<00:00:20.550> you<00:00:21.060> can<00:00:21.240> also<00:00:21.420> offset<00:00:22.289> it<00:00:22.500> like

00:00:22.670 --> 00:00:22.680 
tractor and you can also offset it like

00:00:22.680 --> 00:00:24.500 
tractor and you can also offset it like
if<00:00:22.830> your<00:00:22.980> tractor<00:00:23.460> our<00:00:23.640> tractor<00:00:24.090> is<00:00:24.150> a<00:00:24.180> little

00:00:24.500 --> 00:00:24.510 
if your tractor our tractor is a little

00:00:24.510 --> 00:00:27.500 
if your tractor our tractor is a little
wider<00:00:24.689> than<00:00:25.019> 66<00:00:25.650> inches<00:00:26.099> so<00:00:26.699> we'll<00:00:26.910> offset

00:00:27.500 --> 00:00:27.510 
wider than 66 inches so we'll offset

00:00:27.510 --> 00:00:29.240 
wider than 66 inches so we'll offset
this<00:00:27.720> a<00:00:27.779> little<00:00:28.140> bit<00:00:28.289> so<00:00:28.500> we<00:00:28.619> can<00:00:28.800> clear<00:00:29.070> out

00:00:29.240 --> 00:00:29.250 
this a little bit so we can clear out

00:00:29.250 --> 00:00:31.640 
this a little bit so we can clear out
one<00:00:29.490> side<00:00:29.820> of<00:00:30.000> the<00:00:30.060> tracks<00:00:30.390> another<00:00:31.260> thing<00:00:31.529> to

00:00:31.640 --> 00:00:31.650 
one side of the tracks another thing to

00:00:31.650 --> 00:00:33.530 
one side of the tracks another thing to
remember<00:00:31.710> when<00:00:32.250> you're<00:00:32.460> hooking<00:00:33.239> up<00:00:33.390> your

remember when you're hooking up your

00:00:33.540 --> 00:00:35.660 
remember when you're hooking up your
tiller<00:00:33.780> when<00:00:34.110> you<00:00:34.200> get<00:00:34.380> your<00:00:34.559> tiller<00:00:34.829> this

00:00:35.660 --> 00:00:35.670 
tiller when you get your tiller this

00:00:35.670 --> 00:00:37.400 
tiller when you get your tiller this
tractor<00:00:36.120> can<00:00:36.270> be<00:00:36.390> hooked<00:00:36.630> to<00:00:36.840> a<00:00:36.870> thirty<00:00:37.170> five

00:00:37.400 --> 00:00:37.410 
tractor can be hooked to a thirty five

00:00:37.410 --> 00:00:39.350 
tractor can be hooked to a thirty five
horsepower<00:00:37.860> it<00:00:38.370> can<00:00:38.489> be<00:00:38.550> hooked<00:00:38.670> to<00:00:38.820> a<00:00:38.879> 60

00:00:39.350 --> 00:00:39.360 
horsepower it can be hooked to a 60

00:00:39.360 --> 00:00:41.720 
horsepower it can be hooked to a 60
horsepower<00:00:39.540> tractor<00:00:40.440> and<00:00:40.590> so<00:00:41.280> the<00:00:41.489> drive

00:00:41.720 --> 00:00:41.730 
horsepower tractor and so the drive

00:00:41.730 --> 00:00:44.360 
horsepower tractor and so the drive
shaft<00:00:42.090> will<00:00:42.390> come<00:00:42.660> plenty<00:00:43.500> long<00:00:43.680> enough<00:00:43.739> to

00:00:44.360 --> 00:00:44.370 
shaft will come plenty long enough to

00:00:44.370 --> 00:00:47.060 
shaft will come plenty long enough to
hook<00:00:44.520> to<00:00:44.730> about<00:00:44.940> any<00:00:45.239> sized<00:00:45.570> tractor<00:00:46.230> on<00:00:46.739> most

00:00:47.060 --> 00:00:47.070 
hook to about any sized tractor on most

00:00:47.070 --> 00:00:49.190 
hook to about any sized tractor on most
tractors<00:00:47.610> including<00:00:48.180> this<00:00:48.390> one<00:00:48.660> it<00:00:49.020> will

00:00:49.190 --> 00:00:49.200 
tractors including this one it will

00:00:49.200 --> 00:00:50.840 
tractors including this one it will
probably<00:00:49.620> need<00:00:49.770> to<00:00:49.950> be<00:00:50.070> cut<00:00:50.370> just<00:00:50.399> a<00:00:50.820> little

00:00:50.840 --> 00:00:50.850 
probably need to be cut just a little

00:00:50.850 --> 00:00:55.029 
probably need to be cut just a little
bit<00:00:51.239> and<00:00:51.390> when<00:00:51.539> you<00:00:51.629> have<00:00:51.840> to<00:00:51.989> cut<00:00:52.199> a<00:00:52.230> shaft

00:00:55.029 --> 00:00:55.039 

00:00:55.039 --> 00:00:58.130 

you're<00:00:56.039> going<00:00:56.160> to<00:00:56.219> pull<00:00:56.399> it<00:00:56.430> apart<00:00:57.140> you'll

00:00:58.130 --> 00:00:58.140 
you're going to pull it apart you'll

00:00:58.140 --> 00:00:59.990 
you're going to pull it apart you'll
notice<00:00:58.530> that<00:00:58.710> the<00:00:58.859> metal<00:00:59.250> sticks<00:00:59.520> out<00:00:59.730> further

00:00:59.990 --> 00:01:00.000 
notice that the metal sticks out further

00:01:00.000 --> 00:01:02.599 
notice that the metal sticks out further
than<00:01:00.329> the<00:01:00.449> plastic<00:01:00.719> tube<00:01:01.230> that's<00:01:01.980> so<00:01:02.250> you<00:01:02.309> can

00:01:02.599 --> 00:01:02.609 
than the plastic tube that's so you can

00:01:02.609 --> 00:01:05.750 
than the plastic tube that's so you can
line<00:01:02.910> it<00:01:02.940> up<00:01:03.270> but<00:01:03.870> before<00:01:04.290> you<00:01:04.890> push<00:01:05.549> it

00:01:05.750 --> 00:01:05.760 
line it up but before you push it

00:01:05.760 --> 00:01:08.179 
line it up but before you push it
together<00:01:05.909> if<00:01:06.450> you<00:01:06.600> cut<00:01:06.900> both<00:01:07.170> pieces<00:01:07.200> the<00:01:07.920> same

00:01:08.179 --> 00:01:08.189 
together if you cut both pieces the same

00:01:08.189 --> 00:01:10.760 
together if you cut both pieces the same
length<00:01:08.520> you'll<00:01:09.180> have<00:01:09.450> a<00:01:09.479> hard<00:01:09.840> time<00:01:10.110> lining

00:01:10.760 --> 00:01:10.770 
length you'll have a hard time lining

00:01:10.770 --> 00:01:13.130 
length you'll have a hard time lining
this<00:01:10.920> up<00:01:10.979> so<00:01:11.820> if<00:01:12.210> you<00:01:12.390> get<00:01:12.570> rid<00:01:12.720> if<00:01:12.869> you<00:01:12.990> hook

00:01:13.130 --> 00:01:13.140 
this up so if you get rid if you hook

00:01:13.140 --> 00:01:15.289 
this up so if you get rid if you hook
your<00:01:13.320> three-point<00:01:13.860> hitch<00:01:14.040> up<00:01:14.369> and<00:01:14.640> you<00:01:15.060> like

here see where your clutch is going to

00:01:57.420 --> 00:01:59.330 
here see where your clutch is going to
go<00:01:57.660> and<00:01:58.020> then<00:01:58.500> what<00:01:58.680> you're<00:01:58.830> going<00:01:58.950> to<00:01:58.980> need<00:01:59.220> to

00:01:59.330 --> 00:01:59.340 
go and then what you're going to need to

00:01:59.340 --> 00:02:01.130 
go and then what you're going to need to
do<00:01:59.460> is<00:01:59.760> measure<00:02:00.030> from<00:02:00.480> the<00:02:00.630> edge<00:02:00.840> of<00:02:01.080> your

the end of your PTO shaft looks like you

00:02:18.690 --> 00:02:22.460 
the end of your PTO shaft looks like you
have<00:02:18.840> about<00:02:19.250> 1618<00:02:20.250> inches<00:02:20.480> so<00:02:21.480> get<00:02:21.990> an<00:02:22.110> exact

00:02:22.460 --> 00:02:22.470 
have about 1618 inches so get an exact

00:02:22.470 --> 00:02:24.800 
have about 1618 inches so get an exact
measurement<00:02:22.740> if<00:02:23.310> 24<00:02:23.910> inches<00:02:24.270> is<00:02:24.450> what<00:02:24.480> you

00:02:24.800 --> 00:02:24.810 
measurement if 24 inches is what you

00:02:24.810 --> 00:02:26.720 
measurement if 24 inches is what you
have<00:02:25.020> from<00:02:25.260> the<00:02:25.350> end<00:02:25.500> of<00:02:25.620> this<00:02:25.740> shaft<00:02:26.040> to<00:02:26.640> the

you're<00:02:29.580> going<00:02:29.670> to<00:02:29.730> need<00:02:29.910> to<00:02:30.030> cut<00:02:30.240> your<00:02:30.270> shaft

00:02:30.680 --> 00:02:30.690 
you're going to need to cut your shaft

00:02:30.690 --> 00:02:32.900 
you're going to need to cut your shaft
to<00:02:30.870> and<00:02:31.110> usually<00:02:31.560> a<00:02:31.590> tiller<00:02:31.950> will<00:02:32.220> come<00:02:32.490> longer

00:02:32.900 --> 00:02:32.910 
to and usually a tiller will come longer

00:02:32.910 --> 00:02:34.370 
to and usually a tiller will come longer
than<00:02:33.030> that<00:02:33.180> you<00:02:33.390> have<00:02:33.570> to<00:02:33.720> cut<00:02:33.959> it<00:02:34.110> to<00:02:34.260> the

00:02:34.370 --> 00:02:34.380 
than that you have to cut it to the

00:02:34.380 --> 00:02:37.070 
than that you have to cut it to the
Pacific<00:02:34.890> need<00:02:35.130> so<00:02:35.850> that'll<00:02:36.540> save<00:02:36.750> you<00:02:36.870> some

we've<00:03:33.810> cut<00:03:34.019> the<00:03:34.170> shaft<00:03:34.410> to<00:03:34.590> fit<00:03:34.830> and<00:03:35.100> put<00:03:35.459> it

00:03:35.539 --> 00:03:35.549 
we've cut the shaft to fit and put it

00:03:35.549 --> 00:03:38.180 
we've cut the shaft to fit and put it
back<00:03:35.730> in<00:03:36.000> and<00:03:36.209> reinstalled<00:03:36.750> it<00:03:36.989> we've<00:03:37.860> got<00:03:38.069> the

00:03:38.180 --> 00:03:38.190 
back in and reinstalled it we've got the

00:03:38.190 --> 00:03:39.920 
back in and reinstalled it we've got the
two<00:03:38.370> safety<00:03:38.850> chains<00:03:39.150> here<00:03:39.450> that's<00:03:39.690> going<00:03:39.840> to

00:03:39.920 --> 00:03:39.930 
two safety chains here that's going to

00:03:39.930 --> 00:03:41.510 
two safety chains here that's going to
keep<00:03:40.050> the<00:03:40.230> cover<00:03:40.440> from<00:03:40.709> being<00:03:40.770> able<00:03:41.069> to<00:03:41.310> turn

00:03:41.510 --> 00:03:41.520 
keep the cover from being able to turn

00:03:41.520 --> 00:03:43.110 
keep the cover from being able to turn
while<00:03:41.760> your<00:03:41.940> PTO<00:03:42.300> shaft<00:03:42.690> is

00:03:43.110 --> 00:03:43.120 
while your PTO shaft is

00:03:43.120 --> 00:03:45.059 
while your PTO shaft is
earning<00:03:43.330> and<00:03:43.480> remember<00:03:44.319> that<00:03:44.650> when<00:03:44.920> you're

00:03:45.059 --> 00:03:45.069 
earning and remember that when you're

00:03:45.069 --> 00:03:47.250 
earning and remember that when you're
measuring<00:03:45.459> your<00:03:45.580> shaft<00:03:46.000> when<00:03:46.870> it's<00:03:47.049> going<00:03:47.200> to

00:03:47.250 --> 00:03:47.260 
measuring your shaft when it's going to

00:03:47.260 --> 00:03:50.250 
measuring your shaft when it's going to
be<00:03:47.379> at<00:03:47.560> the<00:03:47.709> shortest<00:03:48.190> place<00:03:48.519> is<00:03:48.849> when<00:03:49.090> the<00:03:49.330> PTO

00:03:50.250 --> 00:03:50.260 
be at the shortest place is when the PTO

00:03:50.260 --> 00:03:53.160 
be at the shortest place is when the PTO
shaft<00:03:50.709> is<00:03:50.920> directly<00:03:51.400> in<00:03:51.670> line<00:03:51.700> and<00:03:52.360> when<00:03:52.989> it's

00:03:53.160 --> 00:03:53.170 
shaft is directly in line and when it's

00:03:58.380 --> 00:03:58.390 
high to be able to get your shaft on

00:03:58.390 --> 00:04:00.449 
high to be able to get your shaft on
when<00:03:59.080> you<00:03:59.200> lower<00:03:59.470> it<00:03:59.590> back<00:03:59.920> you're<00:04:00.250> going<00:04:00.370> to

00:04:00.449 --> 00:04:00.459 
when you lower it back you're going to

00:04:00.459 --> 00:04:03.180 
when you lower it back you're going to
do<00:04:00.640> gearbox<00:04:01.150> or<00:04:01.420> PTO<00:04:01.780> damage<00:04:02.470> so<00:04:02.980> make<00:04:03.159> sure

00:04:03.180 --> 00:04:03.190 
do gearbox or PTO damage so make sure

00:04:03.190 --> 00:04:04.740 
do gearbox or PTO damage so make sure
that<00:04:03.400> when<00:04:03.700> you're<00:04:03.849> doing<00:04:03.879> your<00:04:04.180> measuring

00:04:04.740 --> 00:04:04.750 
that when you're doing your measuring

00:04:04.750 --> 00:04:07.500 
that when you're doing your measuring
you're<00:04:05.049> keeping<00:04:05.500> your<00:04:05.590> shafts<00:04:05.950> level<00:04:06.849> and<00:04:07.030> in

00:04:07.500 --> 00:04:07.510 
you're keeping your shafts level and in

00:04:07.510 --> 00:04:09.240 
you're keeping your shafts level and in
here<00:04:07.959> the<00:04:08.110> first<00:04:08.290> thing<00:04:08.500> we've<00:04:08.650> done<00:04:08.890> is<00:04:09.069> gone

00:04:09.240 --> 00:04:09.250 
here the first thing we've done is gone

00:04:09.250 --> 00:04:11.039 
here the first thing we've done is gone
over<00:04:09.579> it<00:04:09.640> with<00:04:09.790> a<00:04:09.819> to<00:04:10.060> bottom<00:04:10.420> turning<00:04:10.840> plough

00:04:11.039 --> 00:04:11.049 
over it with a to bottom turning plough

00:04:11.049 --> 00:04:13.080 
over it with a to bottom turning plough
that's<00:04:11.950> the<00:04:12.099> first<00:04:12.310> thing<00:04:12.459> needs<00:04:12.700> to<00:04:12.730> be<00:04:12.819> done

00:04:13.080 --> 00:04:13.090 
that's the first thing needs to be done

00:04:13.090 --> 00:04:15.000 
that's the first thing needs to be done
to<00:04:13.239> all<00:04:13.390> Gardens<00:04:14.019> and<00:04:14.409> then<00:04:14.530> we've<00:04:14.650> gone<00:04:14.799> over

00:04:15.000 --> 00:04:15.010 
to all Gardens and then we've gone over

00:04:15.010 --> 00:04:17.699 
to all Gardens and then we've gone over
these<00:04:15.370> two<00:04:15.609> rows<00:04:15.879> with<00:04:16.209> a<00:04:16.239> disc<00:04:16.570> arrow<00:04:16.900> twice

00:04:17.699 --> 00:04:17.709 
these two rows with a disc arrow twice

00:04:17.709 --> 00:04:20.580 
these two rows with a disc arrow twice
and<00:04:18.220> this<00:04:18.639> is<00:04:18.850> hard<00:04:19.060> red<00:04:19.299> clay<00:04:19.660> it's<00:04:20.289> pretty

00:04:20.580 --> 00:04:20.590 
and this is hard red clay it's pretty

00:04:20.590 --> 00:04:23.250 
and this is hard red clay it's pretty
soft<00:04:20.889> you<00:04:21.280> could<00:04:21.430> just<00:04:21.729> find<00:04:22.000> a<00:04:22.180> plant<00:04:22.479> in<00:04:22.750> it's

00:04:23.250 --> 00:04:23.260 
soft you could just find a plant in it's

00:04:23.260 --> 00:04:25.260 
soft you could just find a plant in it's
going<00:04:23.380> to<00:04:23.440> leave<00:04:23.560> a<00:04:23.590> few<00:04:23.889> small<00:04:24.190> clods<00:04:24.550> that's

00:04:25.260 --> 00:04:25.270 
going to leave a few small clods that's

00:04:25.270 --> 00:04:27.150 
going to leave a few small clods that's
not<00:04:25.510> necessarily<00:04:26.080> a<00:04:26.199> bad<00:04:26.289> thing<00:04:26.500> it<00:04:26.949> will<00:04:27.010> keep

00:04:27.150 --> 00:04:27.160 
not necessarily a bad thing it will keep

00:04:27.160 --> 00:04:28.500 
not necessarily a bad thing it will keep
your<00:04:27.310> ground<00:04:27.580> from<00:04:27.760> getting<00:04:28.000> harder<00:04:28.360> after

00:04:28.500 --> 00:04:28.510 
your ground from getting harder after

00:04:28.510 --> 00:04:31.020 
your ground from getting harder after
rain<00:04:28.900> we've<00:04:29.680> not<00:04:29.889> done<00:04:29.919> anything<00:04:30.130> to<00:04:30.910> this

00:04:31.020 --> 00:04:31.030 
rain we've not done anything to this

00:04:31.030 --> 00:04:33.120 
rain we've not done anything to this
side<00:04:31.360> here<00:04:31.840> we're<00:04:32.380> going<00:04:32.470> to<00:04:32.530> go<00:04:32.770> over<00:04:32.979> this

00:04:33.120 --> 00:04:33.130 
side here we're going to go over this

00:04:33.130 --> 00:04:34.920 
side here we're going to go over this
side<00:04:33.400> first<00:04:33.669> with<00:04:33.970> the<00:04:34.060> tiller<00:04:34.300> so<00:04:34.630> you<00:04:34.690> can

00:04:34.920 --> 00:04:34.930 
side first with the tiller so you can

00:04:34.930 --> 00:04:37.110 
side first with the tiller so you can
see<00:04:35.169> the<00:04:35.320> difference<00:04:35.830> between<00:04:36.340> what<00:04:36.789> a<00:04:36.820> tiller

00:04:37.110 --> 00:04:37.120 
see the difference between what a tiller

00:04:37.120 --> 00:04:39.300 
see the difference between what a tiller
does<00:04:37.389> and<00:04:37.660> what<00:04:37.750> a<00:04:37.780> disc<00:04:38.050> era<00:04:38.320> does<00:04:38.560> and<00:04:38.889> then

00:04:39.300 --> 00:04:39.310 
does and what a disc era does and then

00:04:39.310 --> 00:04:40.860 
does and what a disc era does and then
we'll<00:04:39.430> probably<00:04:39.639> go<00:04:39.910> over<00:04:39.940> the<00:04:40.240> area<00:04:40.510> we<00:04:40.630> disc

00:04:40.860 --> 00:04:40.870 
we'll probably go over the area we disc

00:04:40.870 --> 00:04:42.570 
we'll probably go over the area we disc
aired<00:04:41.139> with<00:04:41.289> the<00:04:41.440> tiller<00:04:41.680> to<00:04:41.919> just<00:04:42.160> to<00:04:42.280> make<00:04:42.430> it

00:04:42.570 --> 00:04:42.580 
aired with the tiller to just to make it

00:04:42.580 --> 00:04:55.510 
aired with the tiller to just to make it
better

00:04:55.510 --> 00:04:55.520 

00:04:55.520 --> 00:04:56.890 

you'd<00:04:55.729> be<00:04:55.850> able<00:04:55.940> to<00:04:56.030> see<00:04:56.210> the<00:04:56.360> difference<00:04:56.750> in

00:04:56.890 --> 00:04:56.900 
you'd be able to see the difference in

00:04:56.900 --> 00:04:59.200 
you'd be able to see the difference in
one<00:04:57.080> pass<00:04:57.380> with<00:04:57.680> a<00:04:57.740> tiller<00:04:58.069> and<00:04:58.400> to<00:04:58.550> pass<00:04:58.850> with

00:04:59.200 --> 00:04:59.210 
one pass with a tiller and to pass with

00:04:59.210 --> 00:05:23.930 
one pass with a tiller and to pass with
a<00:04:59.240> disc<00:04:59.569> here<00:04:59.810> right<00:05:00.110> off<00:05:00.319> the<00:05:00.500> bat

00:05:23.930 --> 00:05:23.940 

00:05:23.940 --> 00:05:27.290 

okay<00:05:24.690> so<00:05:24.830> after<00:05:25.830> just<00:05:26.250> one<00:05:26.460> pass<00:05:26.760> with<00:05:27.120> the

00:05:27.290 --> 00:05:27.300 
okay so after just one pass with the

00:05:27.300 --> 00:05:29.090 
okay so after just one pass with the
tiller<00:05:27.540> you<00:05:27.690> can<00:05:27.990> see<00:05:28.260> it's<00:05:28.500> a<00:05:28.620> lot<00:05:28.830> looser

00:05:29.090 --> 00:05:29.100 
tiller you can see it's a lot looser

00:05:29.100 --> 00:05:32.840 
tiller you can see it's a lot looser
it's<00:05:29.610> a<00:05:29.730> lot<00:05:30.080> more<00:05:31.080> consistent<00:05:31.830> soil<00:05:32.130> you

00:05:32.840 --> 00:05:32.850 
it's a lot more consistent soil you

00:05:32.850 --> 00:05:34.700 
it's a lot more consistent soil you
could<00:05:33.090> keep<00:05:33.300> going<00:05:33.630> over<00:05:33.930> a<00:05:33.960> disc<00:05:34.260> hair<00:05:34.530> and

00:05:34.700 --> 00:05:34.710 
could keep going over a disc hair and

00:05:34.710 --> 00:05:36.950 
could keep going over a disc hair and
get<00:05:34.860> it<00:05:34.980> like<00:05:35.160> this<00:05:35.430> but<00:05:36.180> a<00:05:36.210> tiller<00:05:36.480> is<00:05:36.660> just<00:05:36.840> a

00:05:36.950 --> 00:05:36.960 
get it like this but a tiller is just a

00:05:36.960 --> 00:05:38.690 
get it like this but a tiller is just a
one-stop-shop<00:05:37.560> deal<00:05:38.220> and<00:05:38.490> you<00:05:38.550> get

00:05:38.690 --> 00:05:38.700 
one-stop-shop deal and you get

00:05:38.700 --> 00:05:40.280 
one-stop-shop deal and you get
everything<00:05:39.000> like<00:05:39.390> you<00:05:39.540> want<00:05:39.750> it<00:05:39.870> makes<00:05:40.140> it

00:05:40.280 --> 00:05:40.290 
everything like you want it makes it

00:05:40.290 --> 00:05:42.770 
everything like you want it makes it
really<00:05:40.500> great<00:05:40.860> to<00:05:41.070> plant<00:05:41.370> with<00:05:41.700> we're<00:05:42.660> going

00:05:42.770 --> 00:05:42.780 
really great to plant with we're going

00:05:42.780 --> 00:05:44.450 
really great to plant with we're going
to<00:05:42.870> do<00:05:42.960> a<00:05:42.990> better<00:05:43.290> video<00:05:43.560> in<00:05:44.010> just<00:05:44.130> a<00:05:44.310> minute

00:05:44.450 --> 00:05:44.460 
to do a better video in just a minute

00:05:44.460 --> 00:05:46.190 
to do a better video in just a minute
things<00:05:44.910> like<00:05:45.090> a<00:05:45.120> better<00:05:45.510> are<00:05:45.750> really<00:05:46.020> going<00:05:46.140> to

00:05:46.190 --> 00:05:46.200 
things like a better are really going to

00:05:46.200 --> 00:05:48.650 
things like a better are really going to
work<00:05:46.380> a<00:05:46.560> lot<00:05:46.740> better<00:05:47.010> in<00:05:47.400> this<00:05:47.880> looser<00:05:48.390> ground

00:05:48.650 --> 00:05:48.660 
work a lot better in this looser ground

00:05:48.660 --> 00:05:50.630 
work a lot better in this looser ground
after<00:05:48.930> a<00:05:49.110> tiller<00:05:49.440> is<00:05:49.620> going<00:05:49.860> over<00:05:50.220> then<00:05:50.460> with<00:05:50.610> a

00:05:50.630 --> 00:05:50.640 
after a tiller is going over then with a

00:05:50.640 --> 00:05:53.740 
after a tiller is going over then with a
disc<00:05:50.910> hair<00:05:51.180> but<00:05:51.420> the<00:05:51.480> disc<00:05:51.720> care<00:05:51.930> does<00:05:52.200> work

00:05:53.740 --> 00:05:53.750 
disc hair but the disc care does work

00:05:53.750 --> 00:05:57.440 
disc hair but the disc care does work
okay<00:05:54.750> so<00:05:54.950> we've<00:05:55.950> left<00:05:56.220> the<00:05:56.490> rear<00:05:56.730> gate<00:05:57.000> fully

00:05:57.440 --> 00:05:57.450 
okay so we've left the rear gate fully

00:05:57.450 --> 00:06:00.890 
okay so we've left the rear gate fully
open<00:05:57.990> so<00:05:58.200> you<00:05:58.290> can<00:05:58.560> see<00:05:58.860> better<00:05:59.690> somewhere<00:06:00.690> in

00:06:00.890 --> 00:06:00.900 
open so you can see better somewhere in

00:06:00.900 --> 00:06:03.440 
open so you can see better somewhere in
between<00:06:01.020> fully<00:06:01.680> open<00:06:02.190> and<00:06:02.280> halfway<00:06:02.580> open<00:06:03.060> is

00:06:03.440 --> 00:06:03.450 
between fully open and halfway open is

00:06:03.450 --> 00:06:05.210 
between fully open and halfway open is
going<00:06:03.540> to<00:06:03.720> make<00:06:03.900> the<00:06:04.080> difference<00:06:04.500> in<00:06:04.680> how<00:06:04.830> fine

00:06:05.210 --> 00:06:05.220 
going to make the difference in how fine

00:06:05.220 --> 00:06:07.730 
going to make the difference in how fine
the<00:06:05.580> ground<00:06:05.850> is<00:06:06.210> with<00:06:07.080> them<00:06:07.290> with<00:06:07.590> the

00:06:07.730 --> 00:06:07.740 
the ground is with them with the

00:06:07.740 --> 00:06:09.920 
the ground is with them with the
tailgate<00:06:08.010> fully<00:06:08.610> open<00:06:09.120> like<00:06:09.330> that<00:06:09.600> it's<00:06:09.810> going

00:06:09.920 --> 00:06:09.930 
tailgate fully open like that it's going

00:06:09.930 --> 00:06:12.410 
tailgate fully open like that it's going
to<00:06:10.020> leave<00:06:10.260> it<00:06:10.410> a<00:06:10.470> lot<00:06:10.710> coarser<00:06:11.430> than<00:06:11.760> it<00:06:12.240> will

00:06:12.410 --> 00:06:12.420 
to leave it a lot coarser than it will

00:06:12.420 --> 00:06:14.390 
to leave it a lot coarser than it will
if<00:06:12.630> you<00:06:12.780> lower<00:06:12.990> that<00:06:13.290> tailgate<00:06:13.620> but<00:06:14.100> we<00:06:14.220> just

00:06:14.390 --> 00:06:14.400 
if you lower that tailgate but we just

00:06:14.400 --> 00:06:28.600 
if you lower that tailgate but we just
wanted<00:06:14.700> you<00:06:14.820> to<00:06:14.940> see<00:06:15.150> what<00:06:15.360> it's<00:06:15.510> doing<00:06:15.870> there

00:06:28.600 --> 00:06:28.610 

00:06:28.610 --> 00:06:30.950 

see<00:06:29.610> the<00:06:29.760> difference<00:06:30.120> this<00:06:30.270> is<00:06:30.330> gone<00:06:30.660> over

00:06:30.950 --> 00:06:30.960 
see the difference this is gone over

00:06:30.960 --> 00:06:33.470 
see the difference this is gone over
with<00:06:31.110> a<00:06:31.139> disc<00:06:31.440> and<00:06:31.680> a<00:06:31.800> tiller<00:06:32.100> is<00:06:32.669> still<00:06:33.060> not<00:06:33.270> as

00:06:33.470 --> 00:06:33.480 
with a disc and a tiller is still not as

00:06:33.480 --> 00:06:35.180 
with a disc and a tiller is still not as
fine<00:06:33.720> as<00:06:33.930> with<00:06:34.080> the<00:06:34.230> tiller<00:06:34.500> but<00:06:34.770> it's<00:06:34.919> because

00:06:35.180 --> 00:06:35.190 
fine as with the tiller but it's because

00:06:35.190 --> 00:06:38.000 
fine as with the tiller but it's because
we<00:06:35.400> had<00:06:35.550> the<00:06:35.730> tailgate<00:06:36.240> fully<00:06:36.600> opened<00:06:37.290> and<00:06:37.500> let

00:06:38.000 --> 00:06:38.010 
we had the tailgate fully opened and let

00:06:38.010 --> 00:06:40.219 
we had the tailgate fully opened and let
everything<00:06:38.310> discharge<00:06:39.090> really<00:06:39.540> easy<00:06:39.780> so

00:06:40.219 --> 00:06:40.229 
everything discharge really easy so

00:06:40.229 --> 00:06:41.570 
everything discharge really easy so
we're<00:06:40.770> going<00:06:40.860> to<00:06:40.919> go<00:06:41.070> back<00:06:41.250> through<00:06:41.520> the

00:06:41.570 --> 00:06:41.580 
we're going to go back through the

00:06:41.580 --> 00:06:42.980 
we're going to go back through the
center<00:06:42.030> we're<00:06:42.180> going<00:06:42.210> to<00:06:42.360> lower<00:06:42.540> the<00:06:42.750> tailgate

00:06:42.980 --> 00:06:42.990 
center we're going to lower the tailgate

00:06:42.990 --> 00:06:45.620 
center we're going to lower the tailgate
this<00:06:43.590> is<00:06:43.800> over<00:06:44.130> disk<00:06:44.340> area<00:06:44.850> already<00:06:45.240> and<00:06:45.510> it's

00:06:45.620 --> 00:06:45.630 
this is over disk area already and it's

00:06:45.630 --> 00:06:47.450 
this is over disk area already and it's
going<00:06:45.750> to<00:06:45.810> get<00:06:45.990> even<00:06:46.139> finer<00:06:46.560> than<00:06:46.770> this<00:06:47.010> area

00:06:47.450 --> 00:06:47.460 
going to get even finer than this area

00:06:47.460 --> 00:06:49.879 
going to get even finer than this area
over<00:06:47.580> here<00:06:47.729> this<00:06:48.449> is<00:06:48.660> simply<00:06:49.050> one<00:06:49.260> plot<00:06:49.530> one

00:06:49.879 --> 00:06:49.889 
over here this is simply one plot one

00:06:49.889 --> 00:06:52.100 
over here this is simply one plot one
pass<00:06:50.160> with<00:06:50.520> no<00:06:50.729> disc<00:06:50.970> era<00:06:51.300> but<00:06:51.840> with<00:06:51.990> the

00:06:52.100 --> 00:06:52.110 
pass with no disc era but with the

00:06:52.110 --> 00:06:54.080 
pass with no disc era but with the
tailgate<00:06:52.590> down<00:06:52.620> so<00:06:53.220> the<00:06:53.340> tailgate<00:06:53.790> on<00:06:53.970> the

00:06:54.080 --> 00:06:54.090 
tailgate down so the tailgate on the

00:06:54.090 --> 00:06:55.879 
tailgate down so the tailgate on the
back<00:06:54.270> of<00:06:54.419> a<00:06:54.479> tiller<00:06:54.720> makes<00:06:55.050> a<00:06:55.139> big<00:06:55.350> difference

00:06:55.879 --> 00:06:55.889 
back of a tiller makes a big difference

00:06:55.889 --> 00:06:58.129 
back of a tiller makes a big difference
and<00:06:56.100> that<00:06:56.610> will<00:06:56.760> all<00:06:56.850> depend<00:06:57.210> on<00:06:57.419> the<00:06:57.600> soil<00:06:57.840> you

00:06:58.129 --> 00:06:58.139 
and that will all depend on the soil you

00:06:58.139 --> 00:07:04.610 
and that will all depend on the soil you
have<00:06:58.169> and<00:06:58.770> the<00:06:58.949> dryness<00:06:59.220> of<00:06:59.610> your<00:06:59.790> soul

00:07:04.610 --> 00:07:04.620 

00:07:04.620 --> 00:07:06.680 

so<00:07:04.980> now<00:07:05.160> we've<00:07:05.340> lowered<00:07:05.610> the<00:07:05.850> tailgate<00:07:06.389> down

00:07:06.680 --> 00:07:06.690 
so now we've lowered the tailgate down

00:07:06.690 --> 00:07:09.050 
so now we've lowered the tailgate down
it's<00:07:07.440> going<00:07:07.650> to<00:07:07.740> make<00:07:07.950> it<00:07:08.100> quite<00:07:08.370> a<00:07:08.430> bit<00:07:08.730> finer

00:07:09.050 --> 00:07:09.060 
it's going to make it quite a bit finer

00:07:09.060 --> 00:07:11.030 
it's going to make it quite a bit finer
than<00:07:09.510> this<00:07:09.690> side<00:07:09.960> over<00:07:10.200> here<00:07:10.350> that<00:07:10.710> had<00:07:10.889> the

00:07:11.030 --> 00:07:11.040 
than this side over here that had the

00:07:11.040 --> 00:07:14.180 
than this side over here that had the
tailgate<00:07:11.520> up<00:07:11.760> and<00:07:12.450> then<00:07:12.830> groundspeed<00:07:13.830> has<00:07:14.160> a

00:07:14.180 --> 00:07:14.190 
tailgate up and then groundspeed has a

00:07:14.190 --> 00:07:16.790 
tailgate up and then groundspeed has a
lot<00:07:14.580> to<00:07:14.760> do<00:07:14.910> with<00:07:15.090> it<00:07:15.270> also<00:07:15.419> if<00:07:16.350> you<00:07:16.530> take<00:07:16.770> a

00:07:16.790 --> 00:07:16.800 
lot to do with it also if you take a

00:07:16.800 --> 00:07:18.590 
lot to do with it also if you take a
slower<00:07:17.190> ground<00:07:17.580> speed<00:07:17.940> it's<00:07:18.240> going<00:07:18.300> to<00:07:18.480> be

00:07:18.590 --> 00:07:18.600 
slower ground speed it's going to be

00:07:18.600 --> 00:07:20.720 
slower ground speed it's going to be
fonder<00:07:19.169> if<00:07:19.260> you<00:07:19.380> take<00:07:19.560> a<00:07:19.590> faster<00:07:20.130> ground<00:07:20.370> speed

00:07:20.720 --> 00:07:20.730 
fonder if you take a faster ground speed

00:07:20.730 --> 00:07:23.419 
fonder if you take a faster ground speed
it'll<00:07:20.970> be<00:07:21.120> course
