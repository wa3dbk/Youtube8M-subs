for this of course were red and black
and<00:00:32.219> then<00:00:32.309> I<00:00:32.340> use<00:00:32.520> some<00:00:32.700> metallic<00:00:33.149> even

00:00:33.650 --> 00:00:33.660

cylindrical tiles for the screws just

00:00:35.579 --> 00:00:38.510 
cylindrical tiles for the screws just
get<00:00:36.059> that<00:00:36.270> kind<00:00:36.480> of<00:00:36.540> industrial<00:00:37.190> look<00:00:38.190> here

00:00:38.510 --> 00:00:38.520
