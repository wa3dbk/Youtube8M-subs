00:00:12.219 --> 00:00:18.289
 Is it possible to recover from aerophobia of this 

00:00:15.349 --> 00:00:20.720
 the real scourge of our swift 21 

00:00:18.289 --> 00:00:22.490
 centuries when the superliner and in a matter of 

00:00:20.720 --> 00:00:24.620
 watches carry millions of passengers with 

00:00:22.490 --> 00:00:26.840
 continent to continent and almost every 

00:00:24.620 --> 00:00:29.210
 fourth while panicked 

00:00:26.840 --> 00:00:31.580
 take to the air and every tenth not 

00:00:29.210 --> 00:00:33.649
 coping with the sticky horror pass the ticket 

00:00:31.580 --> 00:00:36.050
 on the eve of departure, all knowledgeable skeptics 

00:00:33.649 --> 00:00:38.660
 dismiss no it's impossible because 

00:00:36.050 --> 00:00:40.940
 that people do not fly like a bird finding 

00:00:38.660 --> 00:00:43.310
 in the air against human nature and 

00:00:40.940 --> 00:00:44.840
 it is not clear how this colossus works 

00:00:43.310 --> 00:00:46.850
 called the plane 

00:00:44.840 --> 00:00:50.260
 yes and can there be restless situations 

00:00:46.850 --> 00:00:50.260
 which we do not control 

00:00:50.510 --> 00:00:54.390
 professional pilot with a touch of more 

00:00:52.560 --> 00:00:57.060
 thousands of hours and a certified psychologist 

00:00:54.390 --> 00:00:59.430
 with many years of experience alexey gear your not 

00:00:57.060 --> 00:01:01.710
 afraid to say and rafo bam the truth in the face 

00:00:59.430 --> 00:01:03.739
 ladies and gentlemen you fear no that 

00:01:01.710 --> 00:01:06.119
 what follows absolute security 

00:01:03.739 --> 00:01:08.130
 impossible say experts but 

00:01:06.119 --> 00:01:11.670
 should recognize air transport 

00:01:08.130 --> 00:01:12.869
 the most reliable thing is that absolutely 

00:01:11.670 --> 00:01:15.240
 safe life processes 

00:01:12.869 --> 00:01:16.950
 man is not and never will be 

00:01:15.240 --> 00:01:19.290
 aviation cannot be an exception 

00:01:16.950 --> 00:01:20.670
 the question is only relative risks and 

00:01:19.290 --> 00:01:22.440
 relative safety 

00:01:20.670 --> 00:01:25.410
 how big they are in aviation so here 

00:01:22.440 --> 00:01:26.399
 aviation in aviation they are higher than anywhere else 

00:01:25.410 --> 00:01:28.800
 neither was 

00:01:26.399 --> 00:01:31.020
 tion is the result of the system is 

00:01:28.800 --> 00:01:34.020
 most serious structure this structure 

00:01:31.020 --> 00:01:36.720
 which was created for decades and this 

00:01:34.020 --> 00:01:40.020
 structure in which all possible errors 

00:01:36.720 --> 00:01:41.369
 and defects of malfunction and so on 

00:01:40.020 --> 00:01:43.110
 thought out in advance 

00:01:41.369 --> 00:01:45.509
 unlike our life with you here for 

00:01:43.110 --> 00:01:47.660
 a window where no one thinks about anything and no 

00:01:45.509 --> 00:01:49.710
 one of our viewers probably not 

00:01:47.660 --> 00:01:51.960
 thinks about what he will do if 

00:01:49.710 --> 00:01:53.940
 the car will jam the steering wheel while on the plane 

00:01:51.960 --> 00:01:55.830
 if I like the pilot order clinit 

00:01:53.940 --> 00:01:57.660
 that shaft i have 2 steering wheel i can 

00:01:55.830 --> 00:01:59.670
 decide which handwheels will drive 

00:01:57.660 --> 00:02:00.959
 by plane if he stuck me and 2 

00:01:59.670 --> 00:02:02.729
 steering wheel has autopilot 

00:02:00.959 --> 00:02:04.410
 if my autopilot breaks 

00:02:02.729 --> 00:02:05.429
 there is a duplicate autopilot in some 

00:02:04.410 --> 00:02:07.679
 airplanes are not even one 

00:02:05.429 --> 00:02:09.660
 if I jam both steering wheels and 

00:02:07.679 --> 00:02:11.130
 will render all autopilot and i still 

00:02:09.660 --> 00:02:13.140
 I can control the plane with 

00:02:11.130 --> 00:02:15.530
 pedals and using thrust engines 

00:02:13.140 --> 00:02:18.360
 gain altitude or decline such 

00:02:15.530 --> 00:02:20.250
 perry insurance systems on land outside 

00:02:18.360 --> 00:02:22.740
 aviation does not exist but for example 

00:02:20.250 --> 00:02:24.300
 still very convincing figures 

00:02:22.740 --> 00:02:26.260
 take the biggest hour on the airline 

00:02:24.300 --> 00:02:28.330
