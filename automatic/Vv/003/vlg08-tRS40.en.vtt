00:00:05.570 --> 00:00:05.580 
welcome to another video review it's

00:00:05.580 --> 00:00:07.849 
welcome to another video review it's
been<00:00:05.790> quite<00:00:06.240> a<00:00:06.270> while<00:00:06.569> since<00:00:06.629> I<00:00:07.170> did<00:00:07.230> a<00:00:07.529> review

00:00:07.849 --> 00:00:07.859 
been quite a while since I did a review

00:00:07.859 --> 00:00:09.830 
been quite a while since I did a review
on<00:00:07.919> anything<00:00:08.370> but<00:00:08.580> I<00:00:09.000> thought<00:00:09.420> I<00:00:09.450> just<00:00:09.690> do<00:00:09.809> a

00:00:09.830 --> 00:00:09.840 
on anything but I thought I just do a

00:00:09.840 --> 00:00:12.530 
on anything but I thought I just do a
review<00:00:10.200> on<00:00:10.260> some<00:00:10.830> cloth<00:00:11.099> pads<00:00:11.429> that<00:00:11.820> I've<00:00:12.360> had

00:00:12.530 --> 00:00:12.540 
review on some cloth pads that I've had

00:00:12.540 --> 00:00:14.720 
review on some cloth pads that I've had
so<00:00:13.349> you<00:00:13.440> see<00:00:13.710> here<00:00:13.920> this<00:00:14.130> is<00:00:14.190> the<00:00:14.280> razer

00:00:14.720 --> 00:00:14.730 
so you see here this is the razer

00:00:14.730 --> 00:00:17.570 
so you see here this is the razer
goliathus<00:00:15.470> I<00:00:16.470> you<00:00:16.619> know<00:00:16.859> how<00:00:17.010> to<00:00:17.070> pronounce<00:00:17.279> it

00:00:17.570 --> 00:00:17.580 
goliathus I you know how to pronounce it

00:00:17.580 --> 00:00:19.490 
goliathus I you know how to pronounce it
correctly<00:00:17.670> but<00:00:18.060> there's<00:00:18.300> the<00:00:18.510> speed<00:00:19.109> addition

00:00:19.490 --> 00:00:19.500 
correctly but there's the speed addition

00:00:19.500 --> 00:00:22.580 
correctly but there's the speed addition
the<00:00:20.220> one<00:00:20.609> before<00:00:20.820> the<00:00:21.359> the<00:00:21.750> predecessor<00:00:22.560> to

00:00:22.580 --> 00:00:22.590 
the one before the the predecessor to

00:00:22.590 --> 00:00:24.820 
the one before the the predecessor to
this<00:00:23.010> is<00:00:23.220> actually<00:00:23.820> I<00:00:24.180> have<00:00:24.390> it<00:00:24.539> right<00:00:24.600> here

00:00:24.820 --> 00:00:24.830 
this is actually I have it right here

00:00:24.830 --> 00:00:30.560 
this is actually I have it right here
the<00:00:25.970> razor<00:00:27.650> mantis<00:00:28.650> speed<00:00:29.400> edition<00:00:29.849> and<00:00:30.000> this

00:00:30.560 --> 00:00:30.570 
the razor mantis speed edition and this

00:00:30.570 --> 00:00:32.690 
the razor mantis speed edition and this
one<00:00:30.750> is<00:00:30.900> basically<00:00:31.410> it<00:00:32.130> used<00:00:32.340> to<00:00:32.460> be<00:00:32.579> the

00:00:32.690 --> 00:00:32.700 
one is basically it used to be the

00:00:32.700 --> 00:00:36.139 
one is basically it used to be the
flagship<00:00:33.500> cloth<00:00:34.500> Matt<00:00:34.800> I<00:00:34.950> guess<00:00:35.250> for<00:00:35.940> razor

00:00:36.139 --> 00:00:36.149 
flagship cloth Matt I guess for razor

00:00:36.149 --> 00:00:38.720 
flagship cloth Matt I guess for razor
like<00:00:36.540> razor<00:00:36.780> they<00:00:37.020> have<00:00:37.170> a<00:00:37.469> Swedish<00:00:38.070> edition

00:00:38.720 --> 00:00:38.730 
like razor they have a Swedish edition

00:00:38.730 --> 00:00:41.630 
like razor they have a Swedish edition
and<00:00:38.940> the<00:00:39.500> control<00:00:40.500> edition<00:00:40.860> I'm<00:00:41.430> gonna

00:00:41.630 --> 00:00:41.640 
and the control edition I'm gonna

00:00:41.640 --> 00:00:44.660 
and the control edition I'm gonna
explain<00:00:42.570> the<00:00:43.140> simple<00:00:44.100> differences<00:00:44.520> between

00:00:44.660 --> 00:00:44.670 
explain the simple differences between

00:00:44.670 --> 00:00:46.610 
explain the simple differences between
the<00:00:44.940> speed<00:00:45.239> and<00:00:45.420> the<00:00:45.480> control<00:00:45.899> addition<00:00:46.200> the

00:00:46.610 --> 00:00:46.620 
the speed and the control addition the

00:00:46.620 --> 00:00:49.760 
the speed and the control addition the
speed<00:00:46.910> edition<00:00:47.910> actually<00:00:48.390> is<00:00:48.629> when<00:00:49.350> you<00:00:49.469> use

00:00:49.760 --> 00:00:49.770 
speed edition actually is when you use

00:00:49.770 --> 00:00:52.130 
speed edition actually is when you use
your<00:00:50.100> mouse<00:00:50.399> move<00:00:51.300> your<00:00:51.449> mouse<00:00:51.600> across<00:00:51.899> the

00:00:52.130 --> 00:00:52.140 
your mouse move your mouse across the

00:00:52.140 --> 00:00:55.549 
your mouse move your mouse across the
screen<00:00:52.320> it's<00:00:52.920> actually<00:00:53.039> a<00:00:53.280> very<00:00:54.500> there's<00:00:55.500> a

00:00:55.549 --> 00:00:55.559 
screen it's actually a very there's a

00:00:55.559 --> 00:00:58.670 
screen it's actually a very there's a
lot<00:00:55.710> of<00:00:55.739> friction<00:00:56.070> to<00:00:56.340> the<00:00:57.120> your<00:00:58.020> movement<00:00:58.469> and

00:00:58.670 --> 00:00:58.680 
lot of friction to the your movement and

00:00:58.680 --> 00:01:01.729 
lot of friction to the your movement and
the<00:00:59.010> reason<00:00:59.280> why<00:00:59.370> that<00:00:59.609> is<00:00:59.789> because<00:01:00.149> the<00:01:01.079> cloth

00:01:01.729 --> 00:01:01.739 
the reason why that is because the cloth

00:01:01.739 --> 00:01:04.130 
the reason why that is because the cloth
itself<00:01:02.010> I<00:01:02.520> guess<00:01:02.789> it's<00:01:03.300> not<00:01:03.449> meant<00:01:03.719> to<00:01:04.110> be

00:01:04.130 --> 00:01:04.140 
itself I guess it's not meant to be

00:01:04.140 --> 00:01:07.520 
itself I guess it's not meant to be
really<00:01:04.799> smooth<00:01:05.070> country<00:01:05.909> to<00:01:06.119> the<00:01:06.299> name<00:01:06.530> speed

00:01:07.520 --> 00:01:07.530 
really smooth country to the name speed

00:01:07.530 --> 00:01:11.270 
really smooth country to the name speed
it<00:01:07.799> actually<00:01:08.159> means<00:01:08.400> that<00:01:08.990> it's<00:01:10.010> for<00:01:11.010> players

00:01:11.270 --> 00:01:11.280 
it actually means that it's for players

00:01:11.280 --> 00:01:14.270 
it actually means that it's for players
who<00:01:11.479> have<00:01:12.479> really<00:01:12.930> really<00:01:13.049> big<00:01:13.320> movements<00:01:13.890> in

00:01:14.270 --> 00:01:14.280 
who have really really big movements in

00:01:14.280 --> 00:01:16.850 
who have really really big movements in
their<00:01:14.520> mouse<00:01:14.909> controls<00:01:15.270> for<00:01:15.420> example<00:01:15.869> if<00:01:16.710> you

00:01:16.850 --> 00:01:16.860 
their mouse controls for example if you

00:01:16.860 --> 00:01:18.590 
their mouse controls for example if you
move<00:01:17.040> your<00:01:17.159> mouse<00:01:17.340> with<00:01:18.000> really<00:01:18.299> big<00:01:18.420> mouse

00:01:18.590 --> 00:01:18.600 
move your mouse with really big mouse

00:01:18.600 --> 00:01:20.410 
move your mouse with really big mouse
control<00:01:18.990> and<00:01:19.110> you're<00:01:19.229> moving<00:01:19.320> really<00:01:19.680> quickly

00:01:20.410 --> 00:01:20.420 
control and you're moving really quickly

00:01:20.420 --> 00:01:23.060 
control and you're moving really quickly
the<00:01:21.420> more<00:01:21.600> the<00:01:22.140> friction<00:01:22.530> actually<00:01:22.860> allows

00:01:23.060 --> 00:01:23.070 
the more the friction actually allows

00:01:23.070 --> 00:01:25.280 
the more the friction actually allows
you<00:01:23.280> to<00:01:23.490> control<00:01:23.790> better<00:01:24.150> and<00:01:24.420> the<00:01:24.990> control

00:01:25.280 --> 00:01:25.290 
you to control better and the control

00:01:25.290 --> 00:01:27.620 
you to control better and the control
issue<00:01:25.530> actually<00:01:25.830> is<00:01:26.340> for<00:01:26.759> people<00:01:27.060> who<00:01:27.240> have

00:01:27.620 --> 00:01:27.630 
issue actually is for people who have

00:01:27.630 --> 00:01:30.380 
issue actually is for people who have
smaller<00:01:28.470> movements<00:01:28.710> and<00:01:29.130> I<00:01:29.490> don't<00:01:30.000> have<00:01:30.180> one

00:01:30.380 --> 00:01:30.390 
smaller movements and I don't have one

00:01:30.390 --> 00:01:31.550 
smaller movements and I don't have one
right<00:01:30.450> now<00:01:30.630> but<00:01:30.990> they<00:01:31.140> actually<00:01:31.229> has<00:01:31.530> like

00:01:31.550 --> 00:01:31.560 
right now but they actually has like

00:01:31.560 --> 00:01:33.830 
right now but they actually has like
little<00:01:31.890> indentations<00:01:32.700> which<00:01:32.939> allow<00:01:33.270> for<00:01:33.299> less

00:01:33.830 --> 00:01:33.840 
little indentations which allow for less

00:01:33.840 --> 00:01:35.990 
little indentations which allow for less
friction<00:01:34.079> so<00:01:34.409> you<00:01:34.740> can<00:01:34.950> move<00:01:35.100> the<00:01:35.850> mouse

00:01:35.990 --> 00:01:36.000 
friction so you can move the mouse

00:01:36.000 --> 00:01:40.039 
friction so you can move the mouse
quicker<00:01:36.420> in<00:01:36.720> that<00:01:37.290> sense<00:01:37.470> so<00:01:38.689> this<00:01:39.689> is<00:01:39.840> the

00:01:40.039 --> 00:01:40.049 
quicker in that sense so this is the

00:01:40.049 --> 00:01:42.230 
quicker in that sense so this is the
original<00:01:40.320> version<00:01:40.770> the<00:01:41.070> razor<00:01:41.310> meant<00:01:42.090> to

00:01:42.230 --> 00:01:42.240 
original version the razor meant to

00:01:42.240 --> 00:01:44.359 
original version the razor meant to
speed<00:01:42.540> addition<00:01:42.930> and<00:01:43.140> the<00:01:43.619> technology<00:01:43.920> you

00:01:44.359 --> 00:01:44.369 
speed addition and the technology you

00:01:44.369 --> 00:01:48.109 
speed addition and the technology you
see<00:01:44.610> in<00:01:45.540> all<00:01:46.140> this<00:01:46.680> mouse<00:01:46.920> on<00:01:47.520> this<00:01:47.729> mouse<00:01:47.909> pad

00:01:48.109 --> 00:01:48.119 
see in all this mouse on this mouse pad

00:01:48.119 --> 00:01:51.649 
see in all this mouse on this mouse pad
is<00:01:48.600> actually<00:01:49.170> I<00:01:49.460> don't<00:01:50.460> know<00:01:50.729> the<00:01:51.030> exact<00:01:51.329> name

00:01:51.649 --> 00:01:51.659 
is actually I don't know the exact name

00:01:51.659 --> 00:01:54.139 
is actually I don't know the exact name
of<00:01:51.689> the<00:01:52.259> this<00:01:52.680> technology<00:01:53.189> but<00:01:53.399> I<00:01:53.610> can<00:01:53.970> show

00:01:54.139 --> 00:01:54.149 
of the this technology but I can show

00:01:54.149 --> 00:01:55.819 
of the this technology but I can show
you<00:01:54.210> where<00:01:54.570> they<00:01:54.840> got<00:01:55.110> it<00:01:55.170> from<00:01:55.290> they<00:01:55.560> actually

00:01:55.819 --> 00:01:55.829 
you where they got it from they actually

00:01:55.829 --> 00:02:00.190 
you where they got it from they actually
got<00:01:55.950> from<00:01:56.250> the<00:01:56.430> company<00:01:56.850> called<00:01:57.740> ever<00:01:58.740> glide

00:02:00.190 --> 00:02:00.200 
got from the company called ever glide

00:02:00.200 --> 00:02:02.660 
got from the company called ever glide
there<00:02:01.200> you<00:02:01.290> go<00:02:01.380> that's<00:02:01.979> you<00:02:02.070> gotta<00:02:02.250> come<00:02:02.460> from

00:02:02.660 --> 00:02:02.670 
there you go that's you gotta come from

00:02:02.670 --> 00:02:04.550 
there you go that's you gotta come from
a<00:02:02.820> company<00:02:03.210> called<00:02:03.329> ever<00:02:03.659> guide<00:02:03.899> if<00:02:04.170> I'm<00:02:04.320> not

00:02:04.550 --> 00:02:04.560 
a company called ever guide if I'm not

00:02:04.560 --> 00:02:09.229 
a company called ever guide if I'm not
mistaken<00:02:04.740> the<00:02:06.649> the<00:02:07.649> quality<00:02:08.160> or<00:02:08.190> the<00:02:08.429> texture

00:02:09.229 --> 00:02:09.239 
mistaken the the quality or the texture

00:02:09.239 --> 00:02:10.419 
mistaken the the quality or the texture
of<00:02:09.390> this

00:02:10.419 --> 00:02:10.429 
of this

00:02:10.429 --> 00:02:12.280 
of this
this<00:02:11.000> everybody<00:02:11.599> must<00:02:11.719> but<00:02:11.959> is<00:02:12.140> actually

00:02:12.280 --> 00:02:12.290 
this everybody must but is actually

00:02:12.290 --> 00:02:15.190 
this everybody must but is actually
exactly<00:02:12.650> the<00:02:13.250> same<00:02:13.459> as<00:02:13.670> the<00:02:13.730> razor<00:02:14.569> mentions<00:02:15.049> I

00:02:15.190 --> 00:02:15.200 
exactly the same as the razor mentions I

00:02:15.200 --> 00:02:16.660 
exactly the same as the razor mentions I
I'm<00:02:15.530> not<00:02:15.709> sure<00:02:15.950> if<00:02:16.099> you<00:02:16.159> can<00:02:16.219> see<00:02:16.340> that

00:02:16.660 --> 00:02:16.670 
I'm not sure if you can see that

00:02:16.670 --> 00:02:20.380 
I'm not sure if you can see that
correctly<00:02:16.819> and<00:02:18.219> basically<00:02:19.219> it's<00:02:19.609> exactly<00:02:20.239> the

00:02:20.380 --> 00:02:20.390 
correctly and basically it's exactly the

00:02:20.390 --> 00:02:23.979 
correctly and basically it's exactly the
same<00:02:20.599> like<00:02:21.290> the<00:02:21.439> kitchen<00:02:21.700> stuff<00:02:22.900> exactly<00:02:23.900> the

00:02:23.979 --> 00:02:23.989 
same like the kitchen stuff exactly the

00:02:23.989 --> 00:02:27.160 
same like the kitchen stuff exactly the
same<00:02:24.019> and<00:02:24.469> so<00:02:25.430> with<00:02:25.909> the<00:02:26.090> basic<00:02:26.540> wads<00:02:26.750> of<00:02:26.900> it<00:02:27.019> as

00:02:27.160 --> 00:02:27.170 
same and so with the basic wads of it as

00:02:27.170 --> 00:02:29.949 
same and so with the basic wads of it as
well<00:02:27.859> it's<00:02:28.129> exactly<00:02:28.489> the<00:02:28.639> same<00:02:28.790> in<00:02:29.540> my<00:02:29.689> opinion

00:02:29.949 --> 00:02:29.959 
well it's exactly the same in my opinion

00:02:29.959 --> 00:02:33.280 
well it's exactly the same in my opinion
they<00:02:30.260> probably<00:02:30.500> policed<00:02:30.920> the<00:02:32.019> go<00:02:33.019> out<00:02:33.139> of

00:02:33.280 --> 00:02:33.290 
they probably policed the go out of

00:02:33.290 --> 00:02:37.240 
they probably policed the go out of
glances<00:02:34.420> as<00:02:35.420> a<00:02:35.500> refresh<00:02:36.500> of<00:02:36.680> the<00:02:36.920> basement

00:02:37.240 --> 00:02:37.250 
glances as a refresh of the basement

00:02:37.250 --> 00:02:39.729 
glances as a refresh of the basement
mattress<00:02:37.549> I<00:02:37.700> guess<00:02:38.019> in<00:02:39.019> my<00:02:39.170> opinion<00:02:39.409> just<00:02:39.680> to

00:02:39.729 --> 00:02:39.739 
mattress I guess in my opinion just to

00:02:39.739 --> 00:02:41.410 
mattress I guess in my opinion just to
make<00:02:39.889> more<00:02:40.010> money<00:02:40.159> and<00:02:40.459> just<00:02:40.670> to<00:02:40.849> not<00:02:41.090> be<00:02:41.299> as

00:02:41.410 --> 00:02:41.420 
make more money and just to not be as

00:02:41.420 --> 00:02:43.839 
make more money and just to not be as
fancy<00:02:42.019> as<00:02:42.230> the<00:02:42.620> razor<00:02:42.889> mattress<00:02:43.639> the<00:02:43.819> mattress

00:02:43.839 --> 00:02:43.849 
fancy as the razor mattress the mattress

00:02:43.849 --> 00:02:46.750 
fancy as the razor mattress the mattress
really<00:02:44.659> is<00:02:44.840> a<00:02:45.109> really<00:02:45.709> big<00:02:45.829> mouse<00:02:46.010> pad<00:02:46.250> so<00:02:46.519> I

00:02:46.750 --> 00:02:46.760 
really is a really big mouse pad so I

00:02:46.760 --> 00:02:48.339 
really is a really big mouse pad so I
guess<00:02:47.180> this<00:02:47.389> new<00:02:47.629> addition<00:02:48.019> there's<00:02:48.290> a

00:02:48.339 --> 00:02:48.349 
guess this new addition there's a

00:02:48.349 --> 00:02:50.289 
guess this new addition there's a
smaller<00:02:48.980> version<00:02:49.159> there's<00:02:49.549> the<00:02:50.060> small

00:02:50.289 --> 00:02:50.299 
smaller version there's the small

00:02:50.299 --> 00:02:52.240 
smaller version there's the small
addition<00:02:50.689> small<00:02:51.530> version<00:02:51.829> and<00:02:52.010> there's<00:02:52.159> like

00:02:52.240 --> 00:02:52.250 
addition small version and there's like

00:02:52.250 --> 00:02:53.890 
addition small version and there's like
a<00:02:52.340> medium<00:02:52.669> and<00:02:52.909> there's<00:02:53.090> a<00:02:53.150> large<00:02:53.359> large<00:02:53.810> is

00:02:53.890 --> 00:02:53.900 
a medium and there's a large large is

00:02:53.900 --> 00:02:58.000 
a medium and there's a large large is
basically<00:02:54.319> this<00:02:54.939> and<00:02:55.939> I<00:02:56.599> guess<00:02:56.780> and<00:02:57.109> also

00:02:58.000 --> 00:02:58.010 
basically this and I guess and also

00:02:58.010 --> 00:02:59.860 
basically this and I guess and also
every<00:02:58.400> guide<00:02:58.579> also<00:02:58.790> has<00:02:59.030> a<00:02:59.060> coupled<00:02:59.540> up<00:02:59.599> other

00:02:59.860 --> 00:02:59.870 
every guide also has a coupled up other

00:02:59.870 --> 00:03:02.559 
every guide also has a coupled up other
mouse<00:03:00.620> pads<00:03:00.889> which<00:03:01.459> are<00:03:01.579> exactly<00:03:01.969> the<00:03:02.090> same<00:03:02.180> so

00:03:02.559 --> 00:03:02.569 
mouse pads which are exactly the same so

00:03:02.569 --> 00:03:04.929 
mouse pads which are exactly the same so
here<00:03:02.840> we've<00:03:02.989> got<00:03:03.019> the<00:03:03.379> Everglade<00:03:04.040> tightening

00:03:04.929 --> 00:03:04.939 
here we've got the Everglade tightening

00:03:04.939 --> 00:03:07.780 
here we've got the Everglade tightening
up<00:03:05.090> here<00:03:05.299> which<00:03:05.840> the<00:03:06.230> surface<00:03:06.620> is<00:03:06.769> exactly<00:03:07.579> the

00:03:07.780 --> 00:03:07.790 
up here which the surface is exactly the

00:03:07.790 --> 00:03:10.330 
up here which the surface is exactly the
same<00:03:07.939> as<00:03:08.000> the<00:03:08.239> fanatic<00:03:08.989> one<00:03:09.169> but<00:03:09.769> this<00:03:10.069> one<00:03:10.129> I

00:03:10.330 --> 00:03:10.340 
same as the fanatic one but this one I

00:03:10.340 --> 00:03:13.149 
same as the fanatic one but this one I
guess<00:03:10.609> it's<00:03:10.819> just<00:03:10.879> the<00:03:11.060> sponsor<00:03:11.780> of<00:03:11.810> the<00:03:12.109> tkt<00:03:12.769> I

00:03:13.149 --> 00:03:13.159 
guess it's just the sponsor of the tkt I

00:03:13.159 --> 00:03:16.539 
guess it's just the sponsor of the tkt I
think<00:03:13.730> their<00:03:13.909> gaming<00:03:14.750> team<00:03:15.019> like<00:03:15.290> ages<00:03:16.069> go<00:03:16.250> so

00:03:16.539 --> 00:03:16.549 
think their gaming team like ages go so

00:03:16.549 --> 00:03:18.399 
think their gaming team like ages go so
these<00:03:17.540> two<00:03:17.810> mouth<00:03:18.019> guards<00:03:18.049> were

00:03:18.399 --> 00:03:18.409 
these two mouth guards were

00:03:18.409 --> 00:03:23.259 
these two mouth guards were
prospectively<00:03:19.599> came<00:03:20.599> out<00:03:20.780> a<00:03:21.879> long<00:03:22.879> time<00:03:22.940> ago

00:03:23.259 --> 00:03:23.269 
prospectively came out a long time ago

00:03:23.269 --> 00:03:28.000 
prospectively came out a long time ago
but<00:03:23.959> they're<00:03:24.319> definitely<00:03:24.790> the<00:03:26.919> pioneers<00:03:27.919> of

00:03:28.000 --> 00:03:28.010 
but they're definitely the pioneers of

00:03:28.010 --> 00:03:31.929 
but they're definitely the pioneers of
like<00:03:28.659> cloth<00:03:29.659> surface<00:03:30.260> mouth<00:03:30.409> plans<00:03:30.620> as<00:03:30.829> all<00:03:31.760> of

00:03:31.929 --> 00:03:31.939 
like cloth surface mouth plans as all of

00:03:31.939 --> 00:03:35.199 
like cloth surface mouth plans as all of
them<00:03:32.150> are<00:03:32.709> ruinous<00:03:33.709> so<00:03:34.489> what<00:03:34.760> they<00:03:34.879> I<00:03:34.939> want<00:03:35.120> to

00:03:35.199 --> 00:03:35.209 
them are ruinous so what they I want to

00:03:35.209 --> 00:03:37.089 
them are ruinous so what they I want to
say<00:03:35.389> about<00:03:35.479> them<00:03:35.780> is<00:03:35.930> that<00:03:35.959> this<00:03:36.739> technology

00:03:37.089 --> 00:03:37.099 
say about them is that this technology

00:03:37.099 --> 00:03:39.249 
say about them is that this technology
has<00:03:37.400> been<00:03:37.699> implementing<00:03:38.359> to<00:03:38.629> belong

00:03:39.249 --> 00:03:39.259 
has been implementing to belong

00:03:39.259 --> 00:03:41.170 
has been implementing to belong
different<00:03:39.709> mouse<00:03:39.829> pads<00:03:40.069> but<00:03:40.250> they<00:03:40.400> just<00:03:40.609> make

00:03:41.170 --> 00:03:41.180 
different mouse pads but they just make

00:03:41.180 --> 00:03:47.319 
different mouse pads but they just make
different<00:03:41.659> I<00:03:43.239> guess<00:03:44.239> models<00:03:44.810> to<00:03:45.769> really<00:03:46.329> show

00:03:47.319 --> 00:03:47.329 
different I guess models to really show

00:03:47.329 --> 00:03:48.909 
different I guess models to really show
off<00:03:47.359> really<00:03:47.900> if<00:03:48.109> they<00:03:48.259> didn't<00:03:48.439> use<00:03:48.560> the<00:03:48.709> same

00:03:48.909 --> 00:03:48.919 
off really if they didn't use the same

00:03:48.919 --> 00:03:50.559 
off really if they didn't use the same
texture<00:03:49.340> and<00:03:49.579> you<00:03:49.879> can<00:03:50.030> make<00:03:50.180> a<00:03:50.359> lot<00:03:50.509> of

00:03:50.559 --> 00:03:50.569 
texture and you can make a lot of

00:03:50.569 --> 00:03:53.039 
texture and you can make a lot of
different<00:03:50.900> mouse<00:03:51.019> pads<00:03:51.259> by<00:03:51.949> far<00:03:52.220> I<00:03:52.400> think<00:03:52.729> um

00:03:53.039 --> 00:03:53.049 
different mouse pads by far I think um

00:03:53.049 --> 00:03:56.530 
different mouse pads by far I think um
my<00:03:54.049> favorite<00:03:54.680> out<00:03:55.159> of<00:03:55.220> all<00:03:55.639> four<00:03:55.759> even<00:03:56.449> though

00:03:56.530 --> 00:03:56.540 
my favorite out of all four even though

00:03:56.540 --> 00:03:58.270 
my favorite out of all four even though
the<00:03:56.689> surface<00:03:57.049> are<00:03:57.169> the<00:03:57.259> same<00:03:57.470> it's<00:03:58.129> probably

00:03:58.270 --> 00:03:58.280 
the surface are the same it's probably

00:03:58.280 --> 00:04:00.629 
the surface are the same it's probably
the<00:03:58.819> other<00:03:58.939> guy<00:03:59.180> Titan<00:03:59.599> I<00:03:59.720> mean<00:03:59.930> this<00:04:00.139> one's

00:04:00.629 --> 00:04:00.639 
the other guy Titan I mean this one's

00:04:00.639 --> 00:04:03.129 
the other guy Titan I mean this one's
hugely<00:04:01.639> battered<00:04:02.150> up<00:04:02.299> you<00:04:02.449> can<00:04:02.569> see<00:04:02.840> all<00:04:02.870> the

00:04:03.129 --> 00:04:03.139 
hugely battered up you can see all the

00:04:03.139 --> 00:04:05.289 
hugely battered up you can see all the
sides<00:04:03.560> are<00:04:03.799> like<00:04:03.949> coming<00:04:04.099> off<00:04:04.400> and<00:04:04.819> I've<00:04:05.060> been

00:04:05.289 --> 00:04:05.299 
sides are like coming off and I've been

00:04:05.299 --> 00:04:09.819 
sides are like coming off and I've been
using<00:04:05.509> this<00:04:05.750> one<00:04:05.959> for<00:04:06.379> about<00:04:07.060> ever<00:04:08.290> but<00:04:09.290> the

is<00:04:29.210> that<00:04:29.390> I<00:04:29.600> mean<00:04:29.960> cloth<00:04:30.230> mouse<00:04:30.470> but<00:04:30.680> in

00:04:30.880 --> 00:04:30.890 
is that I mean cloth mouse but in

00:04:30.890 --> 00:04:32.740 
is that I mean cloth mouse but in
general<00:04:31.070> is<00:04:31.370> that<00:04:31.520> they<00:04:31.700> are<00:04:31.730> very<00:04:31.910> adaptable

00:04:32.740 --> 00:04:32.750 
general is that they are very adaptable

00:04:32.750 --> 00:04:35.470 
general is that they are very adaptable
to<00:04:33.110> different<00:04:33.830> answer<00:04:34.550> situation<00:04:35.210> there

00:04:35.470 --> 00:04:35.480 
to different answer situation there

00:04:35.480 --> 00:04:38.830 
to different answer situation there
they're<00:04:36.200> usually<00:04:36.740> the<00:04:37.010> glide<00:04:37.580> on<00:04:37.910> the<00:04:38.420> clock

00:04:38.830 --> 00:04:38.840 
they're usually the glide on the clock

00:04:38.840 --> 00:04:41.710 
they're usually the glide on the clock
is<00:04:39.050> very<00:04:39.950> stable<00:04:40.190> even<00:04:40.520> if<00:04:40.760> you<00:04:40.910> wear<00:04:41.240> off<00:04:41.420> your

00:04:41.710 --> 00:04:41.720 
is very stable even if you wear off your

00:04:41.720 --> 00:04:45.100 
is very stable even if you wear off your
mouse<00:04:42.200> gates<00:04:42.530> as<00:04:42.740> you<00:04:43.040> have<00:04:43.190> here<00:04:43.490> I<00:04:43.670> do<00:04:44.630> pretty

00:04:45.100 --> 00:04:45.110 
mouse gates as you have here I do pretty

00:04:45.110 --> 00:04:46.720 
mouse gates as you have here I do pretty
much<00:04:45.200> a<00:04:45.560> glide<00:04:45.800> the<00:04:45.950> same<00:04:46.130> this<00:04:46.340> is<00:04:46.490> a

00:04:46.720 --> 00:04:46.730 
much a glide the same this is a

00:04:46.730 --> 00:04:49.030 
much a glide the same this is a
different<00:04:47.300> than<00:04:47.480> hard<00:04:47.900> mats<00:04:48.140> where<00:04:48.740> if<00:04:48.890> you

00:04:49.030 --> 00:04:49.040 
different than hard mats where if you

00:04:49.040 --> 00:04:51.220 
different than hard mats where if you
will<00:04:49.340> out<00:04:49.460> the<00:04:49.730> mouse<00:04:50.150> gates<00:04:50.420> they<00:04:50.930> might

00:04:51.220 --> 00:04:51.230 
will out the mouse gates they might

00:04:51.230 --> 00:04:53.530 
will out the mouse gates they might
glide<00:04:52.070> differently<00:04:52.550> the<00:04:52.670> mat<00:04:52.820> guide<00:04:53.030> faster

00:04:53.530 --> 00:04:53.540 
glide differently the mat guide faster

00:04:53.540 --> 00:04:57.010 
glide differently the mat guide faster
the<00:04:53.780> mic<00:04:53.930> like<00:04:54.110> slower<00:04:54.670> the<00:04:55.670> harm<00:04:56.540> at<00:04:56.690> itself

00:04:57.010 --> 00:04:57.020 
the mic like slower the harm at itself

00:04:57.020 --> 00:04:59.740 
the mic like slower the harm at itself
might<00:04:57.350> start<00:04:57.740> deteriorating<00:04:58.430> but<00:04:59.390> with<00:04:59.540> cloth

00:04:59.740 --> 00:04:59.750 
might start deteriorating but with cloth

00:04:59.750 --> 00:05:01.510 
might start deteriorating but with cloth
pads<00:04:59.990> a<00:05:00.110> good<00:05:00.260> thing<00:05:00.410> about<00:05:00.500> it<00:05:00.740> is<00:05:00.830> that<00:05:00.860> it

00:05:01.510 --> 00:05:01.520 
pads a good thing about it is that it

00:05:01.520 --> 00:05:04.090 
pads a good thing about it is that it
will<00:05:01.760> pretty<00:05:02.330> much<00:05:02.420> never<00:05:02.950> deteriorate<00:05:03.950> and

00:05:04.090 --> 00:05:04.100 
will pretty much never deteriorate and

00:05:04.100 --> 00:05:07.450 
will pretty much never deteriorate and
they're<00:05:04.790> pretty<00:05:05.230> big<00:05:06.230> in<00:05:06.440> what<00:05:07.010> that<00:05:07.190> thing<00:05:07.400> is

00:05:07.450 --> 00:05:07.460 
they're pretty big in what that thing is

00:05:07.460 --> 00:05:10.030 
they're pretty big in what that thing is
that<00:05:07.790> they<00:05:07.940> do<00:05:08.000> get<00:05:08.600> dirty<00:05:09.320> very<00:05:09.620> easily<00:05:09.860> so

00:05:10.030 --> 00:05:10.040 
that they do get dirty very easily so

00:05:10.040 --> 00:05:12.310 
that they do get dirty very easily so
you<00:05:10.640> got<00:05:11.360> to<00:05:11.480> watch<00:05:11.600> out<00:05:11.690> for<00:05:11.750> that<00:05:11.930> but<00:05:12.170> you

00:05:12.310 --> 00:05:12.320 
you got to watch out for that but you

00:05:12.320 --> 00:05:14.260 
you got to watch out for that but you
after<00:05:12.860> I<00:05:12.890> try<00:05:13.190> just<00:05:13.220> rinsing<00:05:13.760> it<00:05:13.880> with<00:05:14.060> water

00:05:14.260 --> 00:05:14.270 
after I try just rinsing it with water

00:05:14.270 --> 00:05:16.450 
after I try just rinsing it with water
inch<00:05:14.510> letting<00:05:14.870> it<00:05:14.960> dry<00:05:15.200> and<00:05:15.470> that<00:05:16.220> absolutely

00:05:16.450 --> 00:05:16.460 
inch letting it dry and that absolutely

00:05:16.460 --> 00:05:19.510 
inch letting it dry and that absolutely
just<00:05:17.120> works<00:05:17.330> for<00:05:17.540> me<00:05:17.740> and<00:05:18.740> another<00:05:19.130> thing<00:05:19.250> is

00:05:19.510 --> 00:05:19.520 
just works for me and another thing is

00:05:19.520 --> 00:05:21.880 
just works for me and another thing is
that<00:05:19.550> if<00:05:19.940> you<00:05:20.150> have<00:05:20.180> a<00:05:20.300> bit<00:05:20.510> of<00:05:20.840> cloth<00:05:21.320> pad<00:05:21.590> like
