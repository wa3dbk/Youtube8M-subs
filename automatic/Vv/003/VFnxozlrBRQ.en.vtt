00:02:28.920 --> 00:02:39.640 
sandpaper smooth keeps it moving
fluently<00:02:29.610> evilly<00:02:30.299> and<00:02:31.340> it<00:02:32.340> gets<00:02:32.519> the<00:02:32.640> job<00:02:32.849> done

00:02:39.640 --> 00:02:39.650 

00:02:39.650 --> 00:02:43.729 

me<00:02:40.650> personally<00:02:40.950> I<00:02:41.730> would<00:02:42.239> suggest<00:02:42.450> using<00:02:43.140> some

00:02:43.729 --> 00:02:43.739 
me personally I would suggest using some

00:02:43.739 --> 00:02:46.160 
me personally I would suggest using some
painters<00:02:44.340> masking<00:02:44.700> tape<00:02:45.209> to<00:02:45.420> mask<00:02:45.659> off<00:02:46.049> the

00:02:46.160 --> 00:02:46.170 
painters masking tape to mask off the

00:02:46.170 --> 00:02:48.830 
painters masking tape to mask off the
edges<00:02:46.709> so<00:02:47.670> you're<00:02:47.879> not<00:02:48.030> messing<00:02:48.360> up<00:02:48.659> your

00:02:48.830 --> 00:02:48.840 
edges so you're not messing up your

00:02:48.840 --> 00:02:51.410 
edges so you're not messing up your
paint<00:02:49.109> around<00:02:49.709> the<00:02:49.890> headlight<00:02:50.250> but<00:02:51.090> this<00:02:51.239> was

00:02:51.410 --> 00:02:51.420 
paint around the headlight but this was

00:02:51.420 --> 00:02:56.000 
paint around the headlight but this was

00:02:56.000 --> 00:02:56.010 
a slight emergency kind of needed to get

00:02:56.010 --> 00:03:24.030 
a slight emergency kind of needed to get
to<00:02:56.220> it<00:02:56.370> real<00:02:56.579> quick

00:03:24.030 --> 00:03:24.040 

00:03:24.040 --> 00:03:26.039

00:03:36.539 --> 00:03:36.549

well very good got that next cloudy haze
and<00:03:41.319> then<00:03:41.530> you<00:03:41.620> won't<00:03:41.829> get<00:03:42.069> in<00:03:42.280> with<00:03:43.030> that<00:03:43.060> 3000

00:03:44.039 --> 00:03:44.049 
and then you won't get in with that 3000

00:03:44.049 --> 00:04:01.099 
and then you won't get in with that 3000
grit<00:03:44.250> we<00:03:45.250> got<00:03:45.459> right<00:03:45.670> here<00:03:56.400> switch<00:03:57.400> it<00:03:57.549> up

00:04:09.319 --> 00:04:09.329 

00:04:09.329 --> 00:04:28.300 

then<00:04:10.329> you<00:04:10.450> go<00:04:10.599> right<00:04:10.629> in

00:04:28.300 --> 00:04:28.310 

00:04:28.310 --> 00:04:31.760 

so<00:04:29.310> pretty<00:04:29.550> much<00:04:29.730> after<00:04:30.389> you<00:04:30.810> get<00:04:31.410> the<00:04:31.560> haze

immediately before the product has a

00:04:35.610 --> 00:04:37.700 
immediately before the product has a
chance<00:04:35.970> to<00:04:36.210> settle<00:04:36.510> what<00:04:37.200> we're<00:04:37.350> going<00:04:37.470> to<00:04:37.500> do

00:04:37.700 --> 00:04:37.710 
chance to settle what we're going to do

00:04:37.710 --> 00:04:44.840 
chance to settle what we're going to do
is<00:04:40.940> pretty<00:04:41.940> much<00:04:42.030> the<00:04:42.210> plastic<00:04:43.850> plastic

00:04:44.840 --> 00:04:44.850 
is pretty much the plastic plastic

00:04:44.850 --> 00:04:46.730 
is pretty much the plastic plastic
cleaner<00:04:45.270> is<00:04:45.450> going<00:04:45.600> to<00:04:45.660> get<00:04:45.870> it<00:04:45.990> back<00:04:46.320> to<00:04:46.590> that

00:04:46.730 --> 00:04:46.740 
cleaner is going to get it back to that

00:04:46.740 --> 00:04:50.360 
cleaner is going to get it back to that
clean<00:04:47.490> crisp<00:04:48.200> clear<00:04:49.200> fog<00:04:49.560> light<00:04:49.889> I<00:04:50.130> mean<00:04:50.310> I

few<00:04:54.240> shakes<00:05:01.040> you're<00:05:02.040> going<00:05:02.190> to<00:05:02.280> do<00:05:02.430> a<00:05:02.490> small

00:05:02.830 --> 00:05:02.840 
few shakes you're going to do a small

00:05:02.840 --> 00:05:10.510 
few shakes you're going to do a small
section

00:05:10.510 --> 00:05:10.520 

00:05:10.520 --> 00:05:28.510 

really<00:05:11.270> rub<00:05:11.419> it<00:05:11.539> in

00:05:28.510 --> 00:05:28.520
