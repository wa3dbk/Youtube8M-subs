that that paint has been carrying I was

00:04:38.000 --> 00:04:41.439 
that that paint has been carrying I was
going<00:04:38.240> to<00:04:38.330> use<00:04:38.449> this<00:04:38.979> acrylic<00:04:39.979> and<00:04:40.130> read<00:04:41.120> up<00:04:41.300> on

00:04:41.439 --> 00:04:41.449 
going to use this acrylic and read up on

00:04:41.449 --> 00:04:43.540 
going to use this acrylic and read up on
it<00:04:41.630> a<00:04:41.690> bit<00:04:41.840> doesn't<00:04:42.620> look<00:04:42.710> like<00:04:42.889> it<00:04:43.070> will<00:04:43.220> stick

00:04:43.540 --> 00:04:43.550 
it a bit doesn't look like it will stick

00:04:43.550 --> 00:04:46.600 
it a bit doesn't look like it will stick
very<00:04:43.580> well<00:04:43.880> to<00:04:44.800> solving<00:04:45.800> anything<00:04:46.070> this<00:04:46.400> is<00:04:46.580> a

00:04:46.600 --> 00:04:46.610 
very well to solving anything this is a

00:04:46.610 --> 00:04:48.820 
very well to solving anything this is a
water-based<00:04:47.210> acrylic<00:04:47.389> so<00:04:48.320> I'm<00:04:48.530> going<00:04:48.740> to

00:04:48.820 --> 00:04:48.830 
water-based acrylic so I'm going to

00:04:48.830 --> 00:04:51.460 
water-based acrylic so I'm going to
throw<00:04:49.070> that<00:04:49.150> say<00:04:50.150> for<00:04:50.509> some<00:04:50.660> other<00:04:50.810> projects

00:04:51.460 --> 00:04:51.470 
throw that say for some other projects

00:04:51.470 --> 00:04:53.740 
throw that say for some other projects
I'm<00:04:51.590> just<00:04:51.740> going<00:04:51.860> to<00:04:51.889> use<00:04:52.070> black<00:04:52.630> just<00:04:53.630> to
