now<00:00:58.410> of<00:00:58.559> 185<00:00:59.399> if<00:01:00.059> I<00:01:00.329> wanted<00:01:00.629> to

00:01:01.430 --> 00:01:01.440 
now of 185 if I wanted to

00:01:01.440 --> 00:01:04.340

I've<00:01:01.829> put<00:01:02.190> the<00:01:02.340> the<00:01:02.640> offset<00:01:03.600> bed<00:01:03.809> in<00:01:03.960> the<00:01:04.170> back

00:01:04.340 --> 00:01:04.350 
I've put the the offset bed in the back

00:01:04.350 --> 00:01:08.600 
I've put the the offset bed in the back
bed<00:01:04.559> in<00:01:05.510> 1.09<00:01:06.510> and<00:01:06.840> you<00:01:07.320> see<00:01:07.560> it's<00:01:07.710> worked<00:01:08.010> out

00:01:08.600 --> 00:01:08.610 
bed in 1.09 and you see it's worked out

00:01:08.610 --> 00:01:11.270 
bed in 1.09 and you see it's worked out
evolutions<00:01:09.479> worked<00:01:09.720> out<00:01:09.930> for<00:01:10.229> me<00:01:10.260> the<00:01:10.530> figure

00:01:11.270 --> 00:01:11.280 
evolutions worked out for me the figure

00:01:11.280 --> 00:01:13.190 
evolutions worked out for me the figure
of<00:01:11.400> nine<00:01:11.610> thousand<00:01:12.240> seven<00:01:12.780> hundred<00:01:12.900> and

00:01:13.190 --> 00:01:13.200 
of nine thousand seven hundred and

00:01:13.200 --> 00:01:15.289 
of nine thousand seven hundred and
twenty-four<00:01:13.770> so<00:01:14.490> now<00:01:14.640> it's<00:01:14.760> just<00:01:14.820> a<00:01:15.030> case<00:01:15.240> of

00:01:15.289 --> 00:01:15.299 
twenty-four so now it's just a case of

00:01:15.299 --> 00:01:18.770 
twenty-four so now it's just a case of
waiting<00:01:15.900> for<00:01:16.680> that<00:01:17.610> to<00:01:17.820> get<00:01:17.939> matched<00:01:18.240> all<00:01:18.630> it

00:01:18.770 --> 00:01:18.780 
waiting for that to get matched all it

00:01:18.780 --> 00:01:20.420 
waiting for that to get matched all it
will<00:01:18.869> take<00:01:18.930> is<00:01:19.140> a<00:01:19.350> couple<00:01:19.470> of<00:01:19.860> runs<00:01:20.100> or<00:01:20.400> a

00:01:20.420 --> 00:01:20.430 
will take is a couple of runs or a

00:01:20.430 --> 00:01:25.130 
will take is a couple of runs or a
boundary<00:01:21.030> or<00:01:22.159> just<00:01:23.159> a<00:01:23.280> decent<00:01:23.729> shot<00:01:23.930> for<00:01:24.930> it<00:01:24.990> to

00:01:25.130 --> 00:01:25.140 
boundary or just a decent shot for it to

00:01:25.140 --> 00:01:28.190 
boundary or just a decent shot for it to
move<00:01:25.320> up<00:01:25.530> and<00:01:25.770> these<00:01:26.009> are<00:01:26.340> a<00:01:26.750> very<00:01:27.750> low<00:01:28.020> risk

00:01:28.190 --> 00:01:28.200 
move up and these are a very low risk

00:01:28.200 --> 00:01:31.039 
move up and these are a very low risk
markets<00:01:28.770> because<00:01:29.299> not<00:01:30.299> a<00:01:30.329> lots<00:01:30.600> going<00:01:30.869> to

markets because not a lots going to

00:01:31.049 --> 00:01:31.580 
markets because not a lots going to
happen

00:01:31.580 --> 00:01:31.590 
happen

00:01:31.590 --> 00:01:33.020 
happen
you<00:01:31.829> see<00:01:32.009> I've<00:01:32.159> started<00:01:32.430> to<00:01:32.640> get<00:01:32.759> matched

00:01:33.020 --> 00:01:33.030 
you see I've started to get matched

00:01:33.030 --> 00:01:36.080 
you see I've started to get matched
they're<00:01:33.329> at<00:01:33.450> 109<00:01:34.280> so<00:01:35.280> that<00:01:35.490> means<00:01:35.790> now<00:01:36.030> the

00:01:36.080 --> 00:01:36.090 
they're at 109 so that means now the

00:01:36.090 --> 00:01:37.819 
they're at 109 so that means now the
rest<00:01:36.420> of<00:01:36.540> my<00:01:36.689> bet<00:01:36.869> has<00:01:37.079> to<00:01:37.200> be<00:01:37.320> at<00:01:37.439> the<00:01:37.500> front<00:01:37.770> of

00:01:37.819 --> 00:01:37.829 
rest of my bet has to be at the front of

rest of my bet has to be at the front of
the<00:01:37.950> queue<00:01:38.159> so<00:01:38.400> even<00:01:38.700> though<00:01:38.850> money's<00:01:39.180> jumped

00:01:39.499 --> 00:01:39.509 
the queue so even though money's jumped

00:01:39.509 --> 00:01:41.749 
the queue so even though money's jumped
in<00:01:39.600> front<00:01:39.810> of<00:01:39.900> me<00:01:40.049> they're<00:01:40.229> at<00:01:40.350> 108<00:01:40.650> as<00:01:41.400> soon<00:01:41.640> as

00:01:41.749 --> 00:01:41.759 
in front of me they're at 108 as soon as

00:01:41.759 --> 00:01:44.450 
in front of me they're at 108 as soon as
it<00:01:41.850> comes<00:01:42.060> back<00:01:42.270> up<00:01:42.329> to<00:01:42.509> 109<00:01:42.979> my<00:01:43.979> money<00:01:44.250> will

00:01:44.450 --> 00:01:44.460 
it comes back up to 109 my money will

00:01:44.460 --> 00:01:47.300 
it comes back up to 109 my money will
start<00:01:44.790> to<00:01:45.000> get<00:01:45.149> matched<00:01:45.750> first<00:01:46.170> so<00:01:46.500> you<00:01:47.100> see

00:01:47.300 --> 00:01:47.310 
start to get matched first so you see

00:01:47.310 --> 00:01:49.160 
start to get matched first so you see
17,000<00:01:48.210> go<00:01:48.299> in<00:01:48.450> there<00:01:48.570> at<00:01:48.689> 108

00:01:49.160 --> 00:01:49.170 
17,000 go in there at 108

00:01:49.170 --> 00:01:50.990 
17,000 go in there at 108
so<00:01:49.470> we'll<00:01:49.649> start<00:01:50.220> getting<00:01:50.340> some<00:01:50.670> more<00:01:50.820> of<00:01:50.880> it

00:01:50.990 --> 00:01:51.000 
so we'll start getting some more of it

00:01:51.000 --> 00:01:53.539 
so we'll start getting some more of it
matched<00:01:51.240> at<00:01:51.450> 109<00:01:51.960> this<00:01:52.590> is<00:01:52.799> just<00:01:53.040> a<00:01:53.130> simple

00:01:53.539 --> 00:01:53.549 
matched at 109 this is just a simple

00:01:53.549 --> 00:01:57.109 
matched at 109 this is just a simple
three<00:01:54.180> tick<00:01:54.420> trade<00:01:55.009> and<00:01:56.009> you<00:01:56.729> know<00:01:56.850> we're
