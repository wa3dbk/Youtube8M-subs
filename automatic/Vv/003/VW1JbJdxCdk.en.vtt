00:01:56.789 --> 00:02:06.599
 struggling so typing those who like Mai 

00:02:02.219 --> 00:02:09.539
 this you do too much searching and you 

00:02:06.599 --> 00:02:11.610
 will arrive directly on this 

00:02:09.539 --> 00:02:15.269
 application so if there is one that 

00:02:11.610 --> 00:02:18.810

00:02:18.810 --> 00:02:23.010
 so I did not explain to you how 

00:02:20.549 --> 00:02:25.079
 do what you know I guess so 

00:02:23.010 --> 00:02:27.180
 this super super app 

00:02:25.079 --> 00:02:30.890
 practice because I galley in 

00:02:27.180 --> 00:02:33.269
 game downloaded sisley apps 

00:02:30.890 --> 00:02:36.030
 mytf1 and all for all channels 

00:02:33.269 --> 00:02:37.950
 more or less and we had to jump kind 

00:02:36.030 --> 00:02:39.329
 leave the application and open a 

00:02:37.950 --> 00:02:42.359
 other to see the programs and where 

00:02:39.329 --> 00:02:44.069
 it was a bit misery so here we go 

00:02:42.359 --> 00:02:45.120
 want to clarify that this app 

00:02:44.069 --> 00:02:49.709
 also went 

00:02:45.120 --> 00:02:50.880
 so it's valid on them so 

00:02:49.709 --> 00:02:52.650
 what did I want she is 

00:02:50.880 --> 00:02:53.880
 valid on a computer equipped with 

00:02:52.650 --> 00:02:55.920

00:02:53.880 --> 00:02:59.250
 and it is also valid for 

00:02:55.920 --> 00:03:02.010
 windows store tablets so the 

00:02:59.250 --> 00:03:04.079
 surfaces surface 1 2 3 

00:03:02.010 --> 00:03:06.180
 even cat elsewhere it seems to me that 

00:03:04.079 --> 00:03:08.030
 went out so that's so it's 

00:03:06.180 --> 00:03:10.560
 available on all its applications 

00:03:08.030 --> 00:03:12.630
