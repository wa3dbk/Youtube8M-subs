00:00:01.270 --> 00:00:07.390
 hi here given 22 commenting for all 

00:00:04.000 --> 00:00:14.100
 you and I came to press a little 

00:00:07.390 --> 00:00:18.440
 what is my pc worth from inside 

00:00:14.100 --> 00:00:18.440
 so much on the outside that good 

00:00:20.330 --> 00:00:25.740
 and you're going to see what's left 

00:00:23.670 --> 00:00:27.000
 good as you can see the bottom the truth 

00:00:25.740 --> 00:00:30.900
 is that it is very cool is the one that had 

00:00:27.000 --> 00:00:32.099
 predetermined that of the language I already have 

00:00:30.900 --> 00:00:34.000
 said in several videos that is a language 

00:00:32.099 --> 00:00:37.720
 x 51 

00:00:34.000 --> 00:00:43.270
 and good has 8 gigas of ram processor 

00:00:37.720 --> 00:00:45.580
 intel core i5 hard disk toe 

00:00:43.270 --> 00:00:52.200
 In addition, the graphics card is a 

00:00:45.580 --> 00:00:54.710
 nvidia geforce gtx 555 

00:00:52.200 --> 00:00:58.470
 shortly after the casing is a pass 

00:00:54.710 --> 00:01:01.640
 incredible and good here I am going to teach you 

00:00:58.470 --> 00:01:05.360
 is this man worth 

00:01:01.640 --> 00:01:09.370
 this program is valid for editing 

00:01:05.360 --> 00:01:09.370
 the lights that they have because 

00:01:10.640 --> 00:01:16.420
 ok it has some lights on the casing in 

00:01:13.790 --> 00:01:16.420
 total are 3 

00:01:18.530 --> 00:01:21.430
 and I do not know what this is 

00:01:31.789 --> 00:01:39.270
 well this is my computer what would be 

00:01:36.200 --> 00:01:41.520
 if with this program what can I do 

00:01:39.270 --> 00:01:45.060
 is to change the lights is this our 

00:01:41.520 --> 00:01:48.740
 of color are the lights outside that I 

00:01:45.060 --> 00:01:48.740
 like to see if it looks 

00:01:53.390 --> 00:01:56.950
 I say that you will see it 

00:02:03.440 --> 00:02:08.170
 OK 

00:02:05.540 --> 00:02:08.170
 OK 

00:02:11.260 --> 00:02:14.260
 but 

00:02:17.500 --> 00:02:23.970
 yes, yes 

00:02:21.030 --> 00:02:25.740
 ok if you see it worth it then this is my pc 

00:02:23.970 --> 00:02:28.260
 of basically 

00:02:25.740 --> 00:02:31.319
 the truth is that it is beautiful has 

00:02:28.260 --> 00:02:35.540
 as you can see here the 

00:02:31.319 --> 00:02:35.540
 the symbolism of alyn ware is worth 

00:02:36.630 --> 00:02:42.410
 it is worth turning 

00:02:38.780 --> 00:02:45.430
 that is the word light because it is very 

00:02:42.410 --> 00:02:45.430
 weird because if he left it like that 

00:02:45.740 --> 00:02:59.769
 and off but after 

00:02:52.180 --> 00:03:01.959
 if he had it because you can see the light 

00:02:59.769 --> 00:03:05.579
 if we leave it like this in the head of the 

00:03:01.959 --> 00:03:05.579
 someone would be 

00:03:07.910 --> 00:03:13.460
 then as you can see it has light 

00:03:09.560 --> 00:03:15.260
 is the side is worth it is gorgeous 

00:03:13.460 --> 00:03:17.110
 the light is and then it has the light of the other 

00:03:15.260 --> 00:03:19.090
 side 

00:03:17.110 --> 00:03:21.360
 here you can customize the colors 

00:03:19.090 --> 00:03:25.050
 the colors 

00:03:21.360 --> 00:03:28.740
 and good as you can see the screen of the 

00:03:25.050 --> 00:03:30.210
 Irrigator is HP 21 inches good for 

00:03:28.740 --> 00:03:34.170
 true of nothing is a like it is of 

00:03:30.210 --> 00:03:39.440
 of the are the one of the brand of the voucher and good 

00:03:34.170 --> 00:03:39.440
 here the speakers that are 

00:03:40.319 --> 00:03:42.950
 are 

00:03:44.090 --> 00:03:52.550
 and then the keyboard that is the web link 

00:03:49.870 --> 00:03:54.040
 micro with the degree that is where that is 

00:03:52.550 --> 00:03:57.730
 speak to you 

00:03:54.040 --> 00:04:00.400
 after the mouse that forest series of 

00:03:57.730 --> 00:04:02.609
 lalin wear that we have left and then 

00:04:00.400 --> 00:04:02.609
 here 

00:04:07.350 --> 00:04:12.000
 you see 

00:04:09.350 --> 00:04:14.610
 and this is going to be the future screen that 

00:04:12.000 --> 00:04:19.549
 I'm going to have two screens which is the 

00:04:14.610 --> 00:04:19.549
 supports both screens 

00:04:23.690 --> 00:04:29.770
 and good going back a little to what is 

00:04:26.030 --> 00:04:29.770
 record inside 

00:04:31.009 --> 00:04:38.270
 it's good, for example, it can 

00:04:33.770 --> 00:04:43.210
 change this to red also be blue 

00:04:38.270 --> 00:04:43.210
 and this yellow is worth it because it's tourism 

00:04:43.539 --> 00:04:49.290
 after 

00:04:46.440 --> 00:04:50.820
 so it's worth here the games that I have 

00:04:49.290 --> 00:04:52.760
 they have not created 

00:04:50.820 --> 00:04:56.480
 well this was downloaded my sister 

00:04:52.760 --> 00:04:59.600

00:04:56.480 --> 00:05:02.120

00:04:59.600 --> 00:05:05.199
 programitas el vegas 

00:05:02.120 --> 00:05:09.199
 like our math college 

00:05:05.199 --> 00:05:11.800
 stewart things and well I'm going to sit down 

00:05:09.199 --> 00:05:17.190

 two pennants 

00:05:26.920 --> 00:05:31.020
 so nothing important now 

00:05:32.200 --> 00:05:39.770
 Then, well, I'm going to teach with more 

00:05:35.410 --> 00:05:42.520
 depth because necessary 

00:05:39.770 --> 00:05:42.520

00:07:03.360 --> 00:07:09.630
 later it was also good there was 

00:07:05.820 --> 00:07:11.669
 one better than the one that has and 7 is worth 

00:07:09.630 --> 00:07:17.210
 although that is already enough increases 

00:07:11.669 --> 00:07:19.819
 quite the price, almost 150 euros 

00:07:17.210 --> 00:07:23.360
 after this it is only equal to 

00:07:19.819 --> 00:07:26.790
