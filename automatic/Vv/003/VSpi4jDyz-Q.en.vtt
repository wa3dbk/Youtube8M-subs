a<00:00:04.940> lip<00:00:05.940> enhancement<00:00:06.480> is<00:00:06.950> treatment<00:00:07.950> where<00:00:08.189> we

00:00:08.240 --> 00:00:08.250 
a lip enhancement is treatment where we

00:00:08.250 --> 00:00:12.350 
a lip enhancement is treatment where we
use<00:00:08.370> double<00:00:08.700> filler<00:00:08.910> to<00:00:09.800> augment<00:00:10.800> the<00:00:10.980> lips<00:00:11.360> we

00:00:12.350 --> 00:00:12.360 
use double filler to augment the lips we

00:00:12.360 --> 00:00:13.520 
use double filler to augment the lips we
do<00:00:12.480> this<00:00:12.599> for<00:00:12.750> a<00:00:12.840> variety<00:00:12.990> of<00:00:13.320> different

00:00:13.520 --> 00:00:13.530 
do this for a variety of different

00:00:13.530 --> 00:00:16.609 
do this for a variety of different
reasons<00:00:14.160> it<00:00:14.490> might<00:00:14.969> be<00:00:15.179> to<00:00:15.420> centralize<00:00:16.170> lips

00:00:16.609 --> 00:00:16.619 
reasons it might be to centralize lips

00:00:16.619 --> 00:00:19.970 
reasons it might be to centralize lips
to<00:00:17.039> accentuate<00:00:17.789> the<00:00:17.970> shape<00:00:18.859> improve<00:00:19.859> the

00:00:19.970 --> 00:00:19.980 
to accentuate the shape improve the

00:00:19.980 --> 00:00:23.000 
to accentuate the shape improve the
structure<00:00:20.580> of<00:00:20.699> the<00:00:20.910> lip<00:00:21.090> so<00:00:21.449> perhaps<00:00:22.010> creating

00:00:23.000 --> 00:00:23.010 
structure of the lip so perhaps creating

00:00:23.010 --> 00:00:26.740 
structure of the lip so perhaps creating
a<00:00:23.100> Cupid's<00:00:23.460> bow<00:00:23.699> creating<00:00:24.480> height<00:00:24.990> in<00:00:25.289> the<00:00:25.439> lip

00:00:26.740 --> 00:00:26.750 
a Cupid's bow creating height in the lip

00:00:26.750 --> 00:00:29.630 
a Cupid's bow creating height in the lip
perhaps<00:00:27.750> creating<00:00:28.170> balance<00:00:28.410> even<00:00:28.949> between

00:00:29.630 --> 00:00:29.640 
perhaps creating balance even between

00:00:29.640 --> 00:00:31.519 
perhaps creating balance even between
top<00:00:29.939> lip<00:00:30.210> and<00:00:30.359> bottom<00:00:30.810> lip<00:00:31.019> I'm<00:00:31.140> happy<00:00:31.470> with

00:00:31.519 --> 00:00:31.529 
top lip and bottom lip I'm happy with

00:00:31.529 --> 00:00:34.010 
top lip and bottom lip I'm happy with
the<00:00:31.679> fullness<00:00:31.920> of<00:00:32.189> my<00:00:32.340> bottom<00:00:32.759> lip<00:00:33.000> but<00:00:33.690> I<00:00:33.719> feel

00:00:34.010 --> 00:00:34.020 
the fullness of my bottom lip but I feel

00:00:34.020 --> 00:00:37.190 
the fullness of my bottom lip but I feel
that<00:00:34.050> my<00:00:34.290> top<00:00:34.530> lips<00:00:34.770> slightly<00:00:35.700> thinner<00:00:36.300> and<00:00:37.079> I

that my top lips slightly thinner and I

00:00:37.200 --> 00:00:38.930 
that my top lips slightly thinner and I
just<00:00:37.469> wanted<00:00:37.770> it<00:00:37.980> to<00:00:38.129> be<00:00:38.280> a<00:00:38.309> little<00:00:38.610> bit<00:00:38.760> more

00:00:57.650 --> 00:00:57.660 
process having a lip enhancement when

00:00:57.660 --> 00:01:00.830 
process having a lip enhancement when
the<00:00:57.750> patient<00:00:58.140> arrives<00:00:58.940> and<00:00:59.940> we've<00:01:00.180> agreed

00:01:00.830 --> 00:01:00.840 
the patient arrives and we've agreed

00:01:00.840 --> 00:01:02.299 
the patient arrives and we've agreed
everything<00:01:01.379> that<00:01:01.500> we<00:01:01.620> want<00:01:01.829> to<00:01:01.980> actually

00:01:02.299 --> 00:01:02.309 
everything that we want to actually

00:01:02.309 --> 00:01:04.520 
everything that we want to actually
achieve<00:01:02.579> for<00:01:02.910> them<00:01:03.149> the<00:01:03.780> first<00:01:04.080> thing<00:01:04.290> that<00:01:04.320> we

00:01:04.520 --> 00:01:04.530 
achieve for them the first thing that we

00:01:04.530 --> 00:01:06.530 
achieve for them the first thing that we
want<00:01:04.769> to<00:01:04.830> do<00:01:05.070> before<00:01:05.760> we<00:01:05.880> start<00:01:05.909> injecting

00:01:06.530 --> 00:01:06.540 
want to do before we start injecting

00:01:06.540 --> 00:01:10.850 
want to do before we start injecting
lips<00:01:07.140> is<00:01:07.760> to<00:01:08.760> make<00:01:09.390> in<00:01:10.049> a<00:01:10.229> very<00:01:10.470> comfortable

00:01:10.850 --> 00:01:10.860 
lips is to make in a very comfortable

00:01:10.860 --> 00:01:13.580 
lips is to make in a very comfortable
process<00:01:11.610> so<00:01:12.000> it's<00:01:12.570> important<00:01:13.080> that<00:01:13.110> we<00:01:13.320> numb

00:01:13.580 --> 00:01:13.590 
process so it's important that we numb

00:01:13.590 --> 00:01:16.219 
process so it's important that we numb
them<00:01:14.119> sufficiently<00:01:15.119> to<00:01:15.479> make<00:01:15.750> it<00:01:15.990> comfortable

00:01:16.219 --> 00:01:16.229 
them sufficiently to make it comfortable

00:01:16.229 --> 00:01:18.080 
them sufficiently to make it comfortable
enough<00:01:16.799> because<00:01:17.189> it<00:01:17.310> is<00:01:17.460> an<00:01:17.670> injective

00:01:18.080 --> 00:01:18.090 
enough because it is an injective

00:01:18.090 --> 00:01:20.570 
enough because it is an injective
process<00:01:18.630> I<00:01:18.900> certainly<00:01:19.500> agree<00:01:19.680> that<00:01:20.070> your<00:01:20.189> top

00:01:20.570 --> 00:01:20.580 
process I certainly agree that your top

00:01:20.580 --> 00:01:22.999 
process I certainly agree that your top
lip<00:01:20.790> is<00:01:21.110> smaller<00:01:22.110> than<00:01:22.320> your<00:01:22.470> bottom<00:01:22.799> there

00:01:22.999 --> 00:01:23.009 
lip is smaller than your bottom there

00:01:23.009 --> 00:01:25.670 
lip is smaller than your bottom there
although<00:01:23.490> that<00:01:23.850> is<00:01:24.060> actually<00:01:24.450> an<00:01:24.659> ideal<00:01:25.140> yours

00:01:25.670 --> 00:01:25.680 
although that is actually an ideal yours

00:01:25.680 --> 00:01:28.609 
although that is actually an ideal yours
is<00:01:25.979> that<00:01:26.220> little<00:01:26.909> bit<00:01:27.150> too<00:01:27.630> much<00:01:27.960> smaller<00:01:28.350> than

00:01:28.609 --> 00:01:28.619 
is that little bit too much smaller than

00:01:28.619 --> 00:01:30.950 
is that little bit too much smaller than
your<00:01:28.799> bottom<00:01:29.130> there<00:01:29.400> so<00:01:29.670> don't<00:01:30.420> further<00:01:30.750> is<00:01:30.840> an

00:01:30.950 --> 00:01:30.960 
your bottom there so don't further is an

00:01:30.960 --> 00:01:33.289 
your bottom there so don't further is an
excellent<00:01:31.320> way<00:01:31.560> to<00:01:31.640> improve<00:01:32.640> that<00:01:32.850> and<00:01:32.909> create

00:01:33.289 --> 00:01:33.299 
excellent way to improve that and create

00:01:33.299 --> 00:01:35.179 
excellent way to improve that and create
some<00:01:33.420> balance<00:01:33.600> between<00:01:33.930> your<00:01:34.530> top<00:01:34.860> lip<00:01:35.070> and

00:01:35.179 --> 00:01:35.189 
some balance between your top lip and

00:01:35.189 --> 00:01:36.560 
some balance between your top lip and
your<00:01:35.310> bottom<00:01:35.670> lip<00:01:35.790> and<00:01:35.970> bring<00:01:36.180> a<00:01:36.240> bit<00:01:36.390> more

00:01:36.560 --> 00:01:36.570 
your bottom lip and bring a bit more

00:01:36.570 --> 00:01:38.780 
your bottom lip and bring a bit more
harmony<00:01:37.020> to<00:01:37.170> your<00:01:37.200> face<00:01:37.590> I<00:01:37.920> think<00:01:38.220> by<00:01:38.729> doing

00:01:38.780 --> 00:01:38.790 
harmony to your face I think by doing

00:01:38.790 --> 00:01:41.840 
harmony to your face I think by doing
your<00:01:39.210> lip<00:01:39.390> this<00:01:39.600> would<00:01:39.810> sit<00:01:40.020> well<00:01:40.200> very<00:01:40.470> nicely

00:01:41.840 --> 00:01:41.850 
your lip this would sit well very nicely

00:01:41.850 --> 00:01:43.940 
your lip this would sit well very nicely
generally<00:01:42.720> a<00:01:42.750> lip<00:01:42.930> enhancement<00:01:43.440> will<00:01:43.710> ask

00:01:43.940 --> 00:01:43.950 
generally a lip enhancement will ask

00:01:43.950 --> 00:01:46.480 
generally a lip enhancement will ask
anything<00:01:44.460> from<00:01:45.000> three<00:01:45.450> to<00:01:45.570> six<00:01:45.780> months<00:01:46.170> and

00:01:46.480 --> 00:01:46.490 
anything from three to six months and

00:01:46.490 --> 00:01:49.399 
anything from three to six months and
anywhere<00:01:47.490> in<00:01:47.790> between<00:01:47.970> depending<00:01:48.510> on<00:01:49.229> the

00:01:49.399 --> 00:01:49.409 
anywhere in between depending on the

anywhere in between depending on the
person<00:01:49.979> everyone<00:01:50.580> is<00:01:50.790> very<00:01:51.030> individual<00:01:51.630> so

00:01:52.250 --> 00:01:52.260 
person everyone is very individual so

00:01:52.260 --> 00:01:53.570 
person everyone is very individual so
you<00:01:52.350> can<00:01:52.470> never<00:01:52.710> predict<00:01:53.130> how<00:01:53.220> long<00:01:53.430> it's

00:01:53.570 --> 00:01:53.580 
you can never predict how long it's

you can never predict how long it's
going<00:01:53.700> to<00:01:53.760> last<00:01:53.820> you<00:01:54.300> can<00:01:54.450> never<00:01:54.660> predict<00:01:55.400> you

00:01:58.370 --> 00:01:58.380 
know how quickly a person might

00:01:58.380 --> 00:02:02.719 
know how quickly a person might
metabolize<00:01:58.860> that<00:01:59.520> product<00:02:00.060> so<00:02:01.020> I<00:02:01.440> usually<00:02:02.040> at

00:02:02.719 --> 00:02:02.729 
metabolize that product so I usually at

00:02:02.729 --> 00:02:04.520 
metabolize that product so I usually at
