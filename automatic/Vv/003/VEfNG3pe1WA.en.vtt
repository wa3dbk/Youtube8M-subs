00:00:42.870 --> 00:00:47.930 
out chocolate just make sure it's broke
up<00:00:43.050> it<00:00:43.200> just<00:00:43.320> makes<00:00:43.469> it<00:00:43.559> easier<00:00:43.829> to<00:00:43.920> melt<00:00:46.940> and

00:00:47.930 --> 00:00:47.940 
up it just makes it easier to melt and

00:00:47.940 --> 00:00:49.610 
up it just makes it easier to melt and
we<00:00:48.059> just<00:00:48.180> go<00:00:48.270> continuously<00:00:48.840> stir<00:00:49.170> this<00:00:49.350> until

00:00:49.610 --> 00:00:49.620 
we just go continuously stir this until

00:00:49.620 --> 00:00:52.310 
we just go continuously stir this until
it's<00:00:49.890> all<00:00:50.010> completely<00:00:50.640> melted<00:00:51.050> just<00:00:52.050> keep<00:00:52.199> on

00:00:52.310 --> 00:00:52.320 
it's all completely melted just keep on

00:00:52.320 --> 00:00:54.200 
it's all completely melted just keep on
a<00:00:52.469> low<00:00:52.739> heat<00:00:53.010> otherwise<00:00:53.579> you're<00:00:53.820> gonna<00:00:53.879> start

00:00:54.200 --> 00:00:54.210 
a low heat otherwise you're gonna start

00:00:54.210 --> 00:00:57.110 
a low heat otherwise you're gonna start
to<00:00:54.270> burn<00:00:54.710> the<00:00:55.710> chocolates<00:00:56.280> or<00:00:57.030> the

00:00:57.110 --> 00:00:57.120 
to burn the chocolates or the

00:00:57.120 --> 00:01:00.080 
to burn the chocolates or the
marshmallows<00:00:57.649> so<00:00:58.649> it<00:00:58.980> takes<00:00:59.129> me<00:00:59.280> longer<00:00:59.520> but

00:01:00.080 --> 00:01:00.090 
marshmallows so it takes me longer but

00:01:00.090 --> 00:01:04.100 
marshmallows so it takes me longer but
it's<00:01:00.210> worth<00:01:00.359> it<00:01:00.510> in<00:01:00.570> the<00:01:00.660> end<00:01:02.809> okay<00:01:03.809> so<00:01:03.899> it's

00:01:04.100 --> 00:01:04.110 
it's worth it in the end okay so it's

00:01:04.110 --> 00:01:04.729 
it's worth it in the end okay so it's
halfway<00:01:04.260> there

00:01:04.729 --> 00:01:04.739 
halfway there

00:01:04.739 --> 00:01:06.080 
halfway there

the marshmallows are also starting to

00:01:08.189 --> 00:01:10.899 
the marshmallows are also starting to
melt<00:01:08.369> away<00:01:08.490> too<00:01:09.020> so<00:01:10.020> almost<00:01:10.380> there

00:01:10.899 --> 00:01:10.909 
melt away too so almost there

00:01:10.909 --> 00:01:13.340 
melt away too so almost there
should<00:01:11.909> take<00:01:12.030> about<00:01:12.090> five<00:01:12.750> to<00:01:12.869> 10<00:01:13.080> minutes<00:01:13.320> of
