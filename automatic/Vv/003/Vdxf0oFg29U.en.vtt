00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.330
 or the policies that I hope that 

00:00:01.589 --> 00:00:05.190
 you are very well also come one day 

00:00:03.330 --> 00:00:07.560
 more in the master channel a repeat its 

00:00:05.190 --> 00:00:09.389
 tomorrow and today I am going to bring you a how 

00:00:07.560 --> 00:00:11.040
 maquillo before anything to clarify that 

00:00:09.389 --> 00:00:13.320
 I'm not a professional, much less 

00:00:11.040 --> 00:00:15.630
 thought with this does really little like this 

00:00:13.320 --> 00:00:18.150
 that any constructive criticism will be 

00:00:15.630 --> 00:00:20.310
 very accepted and even more in this video already 

00:00:18.150 --> 00:00:22.320
 I would like to know more about the subject 

00:00:20.310 --> 00:00:24.330
 so if I do something else I would like me 

00:00:22.320 --> 00:00:26.580
 they say you say down there and good 

00:00:24.330 --> 00:00:28.199
 we started and I hope you like a kiss 

00:00:26.580 --> 00:00:30.660
 and thank you very much for seeing God 

00:00:28.199 --> 00:00:35.210
 it sounds like a warrior but a warrior 

00:00:30.660 --> 00:00:35.210
 accompanied by an army you 

00:00:44.770 --> 00:00:48.790
 The first thing I'm going to throw out is going to be 

00:00:46.420 --> 00:00:50.680
 a moisturizer is worth anything to me 

00:00:48.790 --> 00:00:53.410
 I'm still using donna statistics but good 

00:00:50.680 --> 00:00:56.739
 anybody is worth later to it me 

00:00:53.410 --> 00:01:01.629
 I'm going to apply this bulla base that is 

00:00:56.739 --> 00:01:04.030
 in tone 53 it 's very good and I would 

00:01:01.629 --> 00:01:07.330
 applied with this little brooch 

00:01:04.030 --> 00:01:09.910
 applied on the nose nose cheekbones and 

00:01:07.330 --> 00:01:12.910
 chin I extend when with the 

00:01:09.910 --> 00:01:15.010
 Brochita later as half movistar 

00:01:12.910 --> 00:01:17.500
 they have wanted corrector since like all 

00:01:15.010 --> 00:01:19.990
 you know I have some awesome now 

00:01:17.500 --> 00:01:21.910
 same I'm doing as you see there is a 

00:01:19.990 --> 00:01:23.800
 before and after banding at 

00:01:21.910 --> 00:01:26.860
 dark circles and without makeup and you see that 

00:01:23.800 --> 00:01:29.590
 I have a lot of these sc correctors 

00:01:26.860 --> 00:01:31.600
 is very well known is the east and natural with 

00:01:29.590 --> 00:01:32.920
 and good is very basic so 

00:01:31.600 --> 00:01:35.649
 sure davis of which I speak to you 

00:01:32.920 --> 00:01:37.720
 then I apply these compact powders 

00:01:35.649 --> 00:01:40.450
 that also come a little bit of color 

00:01:37.720 --> 00:01:42.729
 so great according to the tone 02 softbeis 

00:01:40.450 --> 00:01:45.250
 and more applied with this brush that is very 

00:01:42.729 --> 00:01:46.220
 basic and you see I have the container already 

00:01:45.250 --> 00:01:48.410
 super 

00:01:46.220 --> 00:01:50.840
 but it's because I'm so much 

00:01:48.410 --> 00:01:52.240
 I have to think about renewing and I 

00:01:50.840 --> 00:01:55.299
 they love these 

00:01:52.240 --> 00:01:58.299
 and to almost finalize what would be more 

00:01:55.299 --> 00:02:00.250
 or less the face I applied this blusher 

00:01:58.299 --> 00:02:02.710
 what is the killers the truth is that yes 

00:02:00.250 --> 00:02:04.330
 a lot of blushes but this seems to me 

00:02:02.710 --> 00:02:05.649
 that leaves a tone that is pretty nice 

00:02:04.330 --> 00:02:07.810
 besides, it is almost not noticeable 

00:02:05.649 --> 00:02:09.399
 well, you see that the 

00:02:07.810 --> 00:02:11.680
 packaging is pretty bolide something that 

00:02:09.399 --> 00:02:14.019
 I already said it a little destroyed but 

00:02:11.680 --> 00:02:15.819
 applied with the skunk because if I 

00:02:14.019 --> 00:02:18.370
 applied with a normal brush leaves 

00:02:15.819 --> 00:02:20.470
 too much color and with the skunk remains and 

00:02:18.370 --> 00:02:21.849
 good and then with this brush is not 

00:02:20.470 --> 00:02:25.200
 like the previous one but a little bit more 

00:02:21.849 --> 00:02:27.590
 fine I applied these bronzing powders 

00:02:25.200 --> 00:02:30.720
 just there 

00:02:27.590 --> 00:02:33.180
 and of some very slight relationship 

00:02:30.720 --> 00:02:36.120
 and I really like how it is with this if 

00:02:33.180 --> 00:02:38.100
 I bought them at the outlet fair 

00:02:36.120 --> 00:02:40.760
 same as in Murcia for a thing of one euro 

00:02:38.100 --> 00:02:44.520
 did to super well subsequent to it I 

00:02:40.760 --> 00:02:48.510
 applied a shadow in the eye area 

00:02:44.520 --> 00:02:51.360
 very very clear and in the basin a a 

00:02:48.510 --> 00:02:53.070
 color a little bit darker but let's 

00:02:51.360 --> 00:02:55.830
 see any are any shade 

00:02:53.070 --> 00:02:58.950
 brown ok you are a little bit you know for me 

00:02:55.830 --> 00:03:00.960
 like ela as depth the eye I do not know 

00:02:58.950 --> 00:03:02.940
 if lillo for this case I will use 

00:03:00.960 --> 00:03:04.590
 This shadow is not me where is 

00:03:02.940 --> 00:03:06.810
 but hey is pretty good for what 

00:03:04.590 --> 00:03:11.180
 which is later in the same eyes 

00:03:06.810 --> 00:03:14.610
 I make the line that I'm using this 

00:03:11.180 --> 00:03:17.580
 That's why it's super eyeliner 

00:03:14.610 --> 00:03:19.110
 Well say no enduring 48 hours 

00:03:17.580 --> 00:03:21.990
 Holds so much but endures a lot and 

00:03:19.110 --> 00:03:23.160
 very muscular look is a pass already 

00:03:21.990 --> 00:03:27.810
 you are watching 

00:03:23.160 --> 00:03:29.880
 and well I make a full line 

00:03:27.810 --> 00:03:32.750
 normal brief eye and then the peak what 

00:03:29.880 --> 00:03:35.510
 I do as you have created to plant 

00:03:32.750 --> 00:03:38.180
 very basic then applied the mascara that 

00:03:35.510 --> 00:03:40.100
 now I am using 2 which is this that 

00:03:38.180 --> 00:03:42.650
 It is also from the fair talk about Murcia 

00:03:40.100 --> 00:03:46.280
 and this which is of priority that is the 

00:03:42.650 --> 00:03:48.500
 times to kill Christ but they are the 

00:03:46.280 --> 00:03:50.090
 two that I better go any of these 

00:03:48.500 --> 00:03:52.340
 where they leave the super cute little ones 

00:03:50.090 --> 00:03:55.250
 I love them I have more but they are the ones 

00:03:52.340 --> 00:03:57.709
 I like them and they are already super recommended and 

00:03:55.250 --> 00:04:02.300
 more or less to finish with the area 

00:03:57.709 --> 00:04:04.010
 from the look came to me I paint a little 

00:04:02.300 --> 00:04:06.140
 I do not sing the tiles 

00:04:04.010 --> 00:04:07.489
 lined up then it's a bit to fill 

00:04:06.140 --> 00:04:09.470
 because we always have some left 

00:04:07.489 --> 00:04:11.420
 little things like I do not like them 

00:04:09.470 --> 00:04:15.050
 filling is already she 

00:04:11.420 --> 00:04:17.630
 efe and last last last last 

00:04:15.050 --> 00:04:19.549
 last lips I simply 

00:04:17.630 --> 00:04:21.829
 applied a color I quite like the 

00:04:19.549 --> 00:04:23.990
 Lilac lips but it seems I do not have the 

00:04:21.829 --> 00:04:27.400
 Enough to carry a lilac 

00:04:23.990 --> 00:04:29.990
 dark therefore my solution is this 

00:04:27.400 --> 00:04:33.370
 He also applied a tad 

00:04:29.990 --> 00:04:36.980
 neil that I have here a kind of 

00:04:33.370 --> 00:04:38.870
 black lipstick between quotes so 

00:04:36.980 --> 00:04:41.210
 well I apply this with a little bit of 

00:04:38.870 --> 00:04:43.100
 that lipstick the truth is that I 

00:04:41.210 --> 00:04:45.600
 love how it leaves my lips because 

00:04:43.100 --> 00:04:47.729
 it's a pretty pretty lilac color 

00:04:45.600 --> 00:04:50.669
 and that's it 

00:04:47.729 --> 00:04:53.039
 and good girl I want all the routines 

00:04:50.669 --> 00:04:54.360
