00:03:41.959 --> 00:03:43.809 
test laundry but it would be definitely
by<00:03:42.349> far<00:03:42.380> the<00:03:42.769> best<00:03:42.980> Fighting's<00:03:43.370> ever<00:03:43.489> been<00:03:43.669> in

00:03:43.809 --> 00:03:43.819 
by far the best Fighting's ever been in

00:03:43.819 --> 00:03:45.490 
by far the best Fighting's ever been in
with<00:03:44.030> and<00:03:44.239> the<00:03:44.630> first<00:03:44.900> fighter<00:03:45.109> that<00:03:45.319> can

00:03:45.490 --> 00:03:45.500 
with and the first fighter that can

00:03:45.500 --> 00:03:47.140 
with and the first fighter that can
match<00:03:45.650> him<00:03:45.859> in<00:03:45.980> speed<00:03:46.340> and<00:03:46.370> possibly<00:03:47.000> in

00:03:47.140 --> 00:03:47.150 
match him in speed and possibly in

00:03:47.150 --> 00:03:49.180 
match him in speed and possibly in
punching<00:03:47.540> power<00:03:47.750> but<00:03:48.139> I<00:03:48.319> think<00:03:48.980> both<00:03:49.160> would

00:03:49.180 --> 00:03:49.190 
punching power but I think both would

00:03:49.190 --> 00:03:50.770 
punching power but I think both would
win<00:03:49.549> the<00:03:49.579> belt<00:03:49.849> but<00:03:50.540> it'd<00:03:50.630> be<00:03:50.750> very

00:03:50.770 --> 00:03:50.780 
win the belt but it'd be very

00:03:50.780 --> 00:03:53.819 
win the belt but it'd be very
interesting<00:03:51.440> to<00:03:51.530> watch<00:03:51.730> do<00:03:52.730> you<00:03:52.819> think<00:03:53.030> Berto

00:03:53.819 --> 00:03:53.829

00:03:53.829 --> 00:03:57.900

the from the Hamed fight that took place

00:06:08.090 --> 00:06:09.760 
the from the Hamed fight that took place
seven<00:06:08.540> years<00:06:08.750> ago<00:06:08.870> but<00:06:09.200> I<00:06:09.260> think<00:06:09.320> the<00:06:09.620> most

00:06:09.760 --> 00:06:09.770 
seven years ago but I think the most

00:06:09.770 --> 00:06:11.620 
seven years ago but I think the most
likely<00:06:10.010> outcome<00:06:10.250> is<00:06:10.760> that<00:06:10.790> Paki<00:06:11.150> I<00:06:11.330> would<00:06:11.480> out

00:06:11.620 --> 00:06:11.630 
likely outcome is that Paki I would out

00:06:11.630 --> 00:06:14.500 
likely outcome is that Paki I would out
