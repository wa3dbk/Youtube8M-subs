00:02:58.049 --> 00:02:59.479 
expect because essence what you're
trying<00:02:58.200> to<00:02:58.260> do<00:02:58.380> is<00:02:58.530> why<00:02:58.680> sort<00:02:58.950> of<00:02:59.010> find<00:02:59.280> out

00:02:59.479 --> 00:02:59.489 
trying to do is why sort of find out

00:02:59.489 --> 00:03:01.280 
trying to do is why sort of find out
what<00:02:59.940> it<00:03:00.090> is<00:03:00.180> in<00:03:00.299> this<00:03:00.390> song<00:03:00.660> that<00:03:00.690> is<00:03:01.019> good

00:03:01.280 --> 00:03:01.290 
what it is in this song that is good

00:03:01.290 --> 00:03:03.770 
what it is in this song that is good
it's<00:03:02.070> it's<00:03:02.489> sometimes<00:03:03.120> less<00:03:03.390> obviously

00:03:03.770 --> 00:03:03.780 
it's it's sometimes less obviously

00:03:03.780 --> 00:03:04.880 
it's it's sometimes less obviously
imagining<00:03:04.260> it<00:03:04.320> might<00:03:04.470> be<00:03:04.560> like<00:03:04.620> a<00:03:04.680> really

00:03:04.880 --> 00:03:04.890 
imagining it might be like a really

00:03:04.890 --> 00:03:07.220 
imagining it might be like a really
great<00:03:05.160> catchy<00:03:05.489> vocal<00:03:06.000> but<00:03:06.630> it's<00:03:06.959> really<00:03:07.049> been

00:03:07.220 --> 00:03:07.230 
great catchy vocal but it's really been

00:03:07.230 --> 00:03:08.990 
great catchy vocal but it's really been
backed<00:03:07.470> up<00:03:07.680> by<00:03:07.890> like<00:03:08.070> the<00:03:08.370> other<00:03:08.519> people<00:03:08.880> at

00:04:22.850 --> 00:04:22.860 
the baseline so that comes out and then

00:04:22.860 --> 00:04:24.740 
the baseline so that comes out and then
the<00:04:22.950> vocal<00:04:23.340> kind<00:04:23.820> of<00:04:23.880> suggests<00:04:24.210> the<00:04:24.420> following

sort<00:07:20.650> of<00:07:20.710> just<00:07:20.950> shape<00:07:21.100> on<00:07:21.280> the<00:07:21.400> screen<00:07:21.940> I've

00:07:22.590 --> 00:07:22.600 
sort of just shape on the screen I've

00:07:22.600 --> 00:07:25.830 
sort of just shape on the screen I've
noticed<00:07:22.780> over<00:07:23.110> years<00:07:23.470> are<00:07:24.160> a<00:07:24.220> good<00:07:24.490> sign<00:07:24.840> yeah

00:07:25.830 --> 00:07:25.840 
noticed over years are a good sign yeah

00:07:25.840 --> 00:07:28.050 
noticed over years are a good sign yeah
and<00:07:26.050> that's<00:07:26.650> that's<00:07:26.800> the<00:07:26.950> basic<00:07:27.310> yeah<00:07:27.790> that's

00:07:28.050 --> 00:07:28.060 
and that's that's the basic yeah that's

00:07:28.060 --> 00:07:30.180 
and that's that's the basic yeah that's
there's<00:07:28.210> a<00:07:28.240> broad<00:07:28.570> spectrum<00:07:28.870> idea<00:07:29.470> what<00:07:29.980> is<00:07:30.130> a

00:07:30.180 --> 00:07:30.190 
there's a broad spectrum idea what is a

00:07:30.190 --> 00:07:32.010 
there's a broad spectrum idea what is a
remix<00:07:30.430> of<00:07:30.610> what<00:07:30.760> you<00:07:30.910> do<00:07:31.060> it<00:07:31.180> and<00:07:31.540> how<00:07:31.840> it's

00:07:32.010 --> 00:07:32.020 
remix of what you do it and how it's

00:07:32.020 --> 00:07:34.200 
remix of what you do it and how it's
