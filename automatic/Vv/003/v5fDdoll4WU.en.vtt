00:00:44.930 --> 00:00:44.940 
vs my complete honest opinion on the

00:00:44.940 --> 00:00:47.180 
vs my complete honest opinion on the
attack<00:00:45.210> boats<00:00:45.450> I<00:00:45.719> think<00:00:46.379> most<00:00:46.770> of<00:00:46.829> the<00:00:46.950> time

00:00:47.180 --> 00:00:47.190 
attack boats I think most of the time

00:00:47.190 --> 00:00:49.610 
attack boats I think most of the time
the<00:00:47.430> attempt<00:00:47.730> oats<00:00:47.910> are<00:00:48.059> overpowered<00:00:48.930> and<00:00:49.200> at

00:00:49.610 --> 00:00:49.620 
the attempt oats are overpowered and at

00:00:49.620 --> 00:00:51.889 
the attempt oats are overpowered and at
other<00:00:49.829> times<00:00:49.920> they<00:00:50.370> can<00:00:50.550> be<00:00:50.670> underpowered<00:00:51.120> now

00:00:51.889 --> 00:00:51.899 
other times they can be underpowered now

00:00:51.899 --> 00:00:53.450 
other times they can be underpowered now
what<00:00:52.110> I<00:00:52.140> mean<00:00:52.350> by<00:00:52.410> that<00:00:52.530> is<00:00:52.980> when<00:00:53.309> you're

00:00:53.450 --> 00:00:53.460 
what I mean by that is when you're

00:00:53.460 --> 00:00:54.889 
what I mean by that is when you're
planning<00:00:53.699> on<00:00:53.789> the<00:00:53.910> right<00:00:54.090> game<00:00:54.300> mode<00:00:54.510> and<00:00:54.780> on

00:00:54.889 --> 00:00:54.899 
planning on the right game mode and on

00:00:54.899 --> 00:00:56.569 
planning on the right game mode and on
the<00:00:54.989> right<00:00:55.170> map<00:00:55.379> you<00:00:55.739> can<00:00:55.860> really<00:00:56.129> rip<00:00:56.399> up

00:00:56.569 --> 00:00:56.579 
the right map you can really rip up

00:00:56.579 --> 00:00:58.189 
the right map you can really rip up

as far as 225 millimeter rounds so quick

00:01:37.020 --> 00:01:39.289 
as far as 225 millimeter rounds so quick
if<00:01:37.290> you<00:01:38.040> have<00:01:38.159> a<00:01:38.189> good<00:01:38.460> and<00:01:38.670> fast<00:01:38.909> trigger

00:01:39.289 --> 00:01:39.299 
if you have a good and fast trigger

00:01:39.299 --> 00:01:41.749 
if you have a good and fast trigger
finger<00:01:39.720> you<00:01:40.350> can<00:01:40.530> get<00:01:40.680> all<00:01:40.799> the<00:01:40.829> 32<00:01:41.400> rounds

finger you can get all the 32 rounds

00:01:41.759 --> 00:01:44.149 
finger you can get all the 32 rounds
downrange<00:01:41.970> very<00:01:42.600> quickly<00:01:42.930> it<00:01:43.619> will<00:01:43.680> turn<00:01:43.950> the

00:01:44.149 --> 00:01:44.159 
downrange very quickly it will turn the

00:01:44.159 --> 00:01:45.800 
downrange very quickly it will turn the
burst<00:01:44.430> mode<00:01:44.549> into<00:01:44.970> practically<00:01:45.509> fully

burst mode into practically fully

00:01:45.810 --> 00:01:48.889 
burst mode into practically fully
automatic<00:01:46.470> then<00:01:47.340> I<00:01:47.369> chose<00:01:47.820> ttp<00:01:48.329> missiles<00:01:48.750> for

00:01:48.889 --> 00:01:48.899 
automatic then I chose ttp missiles for

00:01:48.899 --> 00:01:50.270 
automatic then I chose ttp missiles for
the<00:01:48.990> secondary<00:01:49.320> weapon<00:01:49.649> section<00:01:50.009> because

00:01:50.270 --> 00:01:50.280 
the secondary weapon section because

00:01:50.280 --> 00:01:52.010 
the secondary weapon section because
there<00:01:50.670> is<00:01:50.790> so<00:01:50.939> powerful<00:01:51.149> against<00:01:51.810> other

00:01:52.010 --> 00:01:52.020 
there is so powerful against other

00:01:52.020 --> 00:01:53.870 
there is so powerful against other
attack<00:01:52.320> boats<00:01:52.560> and<00:01:52.829> they<00:01:53.159> take<00:01:53.340> no<00:01:53.460> time<00:01:53.640> to

00:01:53.870 --> 00:01:53.880 
attack boats and they take no time to

00:01:53.880 --> 00:01:56.149 
attack boats and they take no time to
reload<00:01:54.210> so<00:01:54.869> you<00:01:54.930> can<00:01:55.320> get<00:01:55.470> two<00:01:55.770> missiles

00:01:56.149 --> 00:01:56.159 
reload so you can get two missiles

00:01:56.159 --> 00:01:58.789 
reload so you can get two missiles
downrange<00:01:56.610> very<00:01:56.909> quickly<00:01:57.210> one<00:01:58.110> missile<00:01:58.530> will

00:01:58.789 --> 00:01:58.799 
downrange very quickly one missile will

00:01:58.799 --> 00:02:00.590 
downrange very quickly one missile will
usually<00:01:59.040> already<00:01:59.399> a<00:01:59.549> mobile<00:01:59.969> as<00:02:00.090> the<00:02:00.210> vehicle

00:02:00.590 --> 00:02:00.600 
usually already a mobile as the vehicle

00:02:00.600 --> 00:02:01.969 
usually already a mobile as the vehicle
and<00:02:00.810> then<00:02:01.049> the<00:02:01.170> second<00:02:01.500> one<00:02:01.530> will<00:02:01.799> do<00:02:01.950> even

00:02:01.969 --> 00:02:01.979 
and then the second one will do even

00:02:01.979 --> 00:02:04.249 
and then the second one will do even
more<00:02:02.189> damage<00:02:02.399> and<00:02:02.909> I<00:02:03.329> usually<00:02:03.689> finish<00:02:03.990> it<00:02:04.110> off

00:02:04.249 --> 00:02:04.259 
more damage and I usually finish it off

00:02:04.259 --> 00:02:06.950 
more damage and I usually finish it off
with<00:02:04.290> the<00:02:04.560> verse<00:02:04.710> cannon<00:02:05.100> in<00:02:05.600> my<00:02:06.600> complete

00:02:06.950 --> 00:02:06.960 
with the verse cannon in my complete

00:02:06.960 --> 00:02:09.050 
with the verse cannon in my complete
honest<00:02:07.259> opinion<00:02:07.680> I<00:02:07.890> think<00:02:07.920> the<00:02:08.340> TV<00:02:08.670> missiles

00:02:09.050 --> 00:02:09.060 
honest opinion I think the TV missiles

00:02:09.060 --> 00:02:10.230 
honest opinion I think the TV missiles
are<00:02:09.270> very<00:02:09.599> old

00:02:10.230 --> 00:02:10.240 
are very old

00:02:10.240 --> 00:02:12.390 
are very old
and<00:02:10.720> can<00:02:10.960> be<00:02:11.050> quite<00:02:11.290> annoying<00:02:11.560> at<00:02:11.770> times<00:02:11.800> to<00:02:12.280> be

00:02:12.390 --> 00:02:12.400 
and can be quite annoying at times to be

00:02:12.400 --> 00:02:14.430 
and can be quite annoying at times to be
on<00:02:12.550> the<00:02:12.640> receiving<00:02:12.760> end<00:02:13.180> I've<00:02:13.480> seen<00:02:14.140> players

00:02:14.430 --> 00:02:14.440 
on the receiving end I've seen players

00:02:14.440 --> 00:02:16.380 
on the receiving end I've seen players
park<00:02:14.800> the<00:02:14.950> boat<00:02:15.100> in<00:02:15.280> the<00:02:15.310> deployment<00:02:16.030> and<00:02:16.150> then

00:02:16.380 --> 00:02:16.390 
park the boat in the deployment and then

00:02:16.390 --> 00:02:18.180 
park the boat in the deployment and then
use<00:02:16.570> the<00:02:16.720> TV<00:02:16.900> missiles<00:02:17.440> to<00:02:17.530> snipe<00:02:17.770> enemy

00:02:18.180 --> 00:02:18.190 
use the TV missiles to snipe enemy

00:02:18.190 --> 00:02:20.520 
use the TV missiles to snipe enemy
vehicles<00:02:18.670> far<00:02:18.880> away<00:02:19.120> from<00:02:19.210> them<00:02:19.510> and<00:02:19.720> I<00:02:20.380> can

00:02:20.520 --> 00:02:20.530 
vehicles far away from them and I can

00:02:20.530 --> 00:02:22.350 
vehicles far away from them and I can
understand<00:02:21.040> why<00:02:21.220> the<00:02:21.280> enemy<00:02:21.790> will<00:02:22.000> be<00:02:22.030> very

00:02:22.350 --> 00:02:22.360 
understand why the enemy will be very

00:02:22.360 --> 00:02:24.390 
understand why the enemy will be very
mad<00:02:22.570> at<00:02:22.750> them<00:02:22.960> and<00:02:23.170> they<00:02:23.770> have<00:02:23.920> nothing<00:02:24.130> they

00:02:24.390 --> 00:02:24.400 
mad at them and they have nothing they

00:02:24.400 --> 00:02:27.030 
mad at them and they have nothing they
could<00:02:24.460> do<00:02:24.760> against<00:02:25.120> that<00:02:25.290> then<00:02:26.290> I<00:02:26.500> use<00:02:26.680> active

00:02:27.030 --> 00:02:27.040 
could do against that then I use active

00:02:27.040 --> 00:02:29.070 
could do against that then I use active
protection<00:02:27.160> for<00:02:27.670> my<00:02:27.700> countermeasure<00:02:28.240> in<00:02:28.600> my

00:02:29.070 --> 00:02:29.080 
protection for my countermeasure in my

00:02:29.080 --> 00:02:31.380 
protection for my countermeasure in my
opinion<00:02:29.320> I<00:02:29.590> think<00:02:29.650> the<00:02:30.070> best<00:02:30.250> of<00:02:30.490> all<00:02:30.790> for<00:02:31.150> them

00:02:31.380 --> 00:02:31.390 
opinion I think the best of all for them

00:02:31.390 --> 00:02:33.870 
opinion I think the best of all for them
I<00:02:31.600> used<00:02:32.260> to<00:02:32.320> have<00:02:32.500> problem<00:02:32.830> with<00:02:32.860> using<00:02:33.430> it<00:02:33.730> and

00:02:33.870 --> 00:02:33.880 
I used to have problem with using it and

00:02:33.880 --> 00:02:35.880 
I used to have problem with using it and
I<00:02:34.240> used<00:02:34.450> to<00:02:34.510> before<00:02:34.720> and<00:02:35.320> it<00:02:35.500> didn't<00:02:35.770> really

00:02:35.880 --> 00:02:35.890 
I used to before and it didn't really

00:02:35.890 --> 00:02:38.250 
I used to before and it didn't really
work<00:02:36.010> out<00:02:36.340> for<00:02:36.580> me<00:02:36.610> so<00:02:37.030> for<00:02:37.450> a<00:02:37.480> while<00:02:37.690> I<00:02:37.750> use<00:02:38.110> the

00:02:38.250 --> 00:02:38.260 
work out for me so for a while I use the

00:02:38.260 --> 00:02:40.860 
work out for me so for a while I use the
IR<00:02:38.590> smoke<00:02:38.860> but<00:02:39.700> now<00:02:39.850> when<00:02:40.120> you<00:02:40.210> equip<00:02:40.480> active

00:02:40.860 --> 00:02:40.870 
IR smoke but now when you equip active

00:02:40.870 --> 00:02:42.960 
IR smoke but now when you equip active
protection<00:02:41.020> and<00:02:41.500> activate<00:02:42.220> it<00:02:42.370> you'll<00:02:42.730> get<00:02:42.910> a

00:02:42.960 --> 00:02:42.970 
protection and activate it you'll get a

00:02:42.970 --> 00:02:44.610 
protection and activate it you'll get a
few<00:02:43.210> seconds<00:02:43.540> of<00:02:43.660> protection<00:02:44.080> from<00:02:44.290> most

00:02:44.610 --> 00:02:44.620 
few seconds of protection from most

00:02:44.620 --> 00:02:46.440 
few seconds of protection from most
enemy<00:02:44.950> fire<00:02:45.250> and<00:02:45.490> then<00:02:45.820> it<00:02:46.090> will<00:02:46.210> have<00:02:46.330> to

00:02:46.440 --> 00:02:46.450 
enemy fire and then it will have to

00:02:46.450 --> 00:02:48.570 
enemy fire and then it will have to
reload<00:02:46.780> it<00:02:46.900> and<00:02:46.990> cool<00:02:47.170> down<00:02:47.200> for<00:02:47.770> 70<00:02:48.190> seconds

00:02:48.570 --> 00:02:48.580 
reload it and cool down for 70 seconds

00:02:48.580 --> 00:02:51.150 
reload it and cool down for 70 seconds
if<00:02:48.760> you<00:02:49.450> know<00:02:49.930> an<00:02:50.110> attacker<00:02:50.380> I'd<00:02:50.620> like<00:02:50.860> to<00:02:50.980> do<00:02:51.130> a

00:02:51.150 --> 00:02:51.160 
if you know an attacker I'd like to do a

00:02:51.160 --> 00:02:53.340 
if you know an attacker I'd like to do a
strafing<00:02:51.430> run<00:02:51.730> on<00:02:51.850> you<00:02:52.060> activate<00:02:52.750> it<00:02:52.900> and<00:02:53.020> then

00:02:53.340 --> 00:02:53.350 
strafing run on you activate it and then

00:02:53.350 --> 00:02:55.440 
strafing run on you activate it and then
it<00:02:53.590> will<00:02:53.710> usually<00:02:53.920> block<00:02:54.400> all<00:02:54.640> of<00:02:54.970> the<00:02:55.120> 30

00:02:55.440 --> 00:02:55.450 
it will usually block all of the 30

00:02:55.450 --> 00:02:56.700 
it will usually block all of the 30
millimeter<00:02:55.960> rounds<00:02:56.290> from<00:02:56.410> the<00:02:56.560> whole

00:02:56.700 --> 00:02:56.710 
millimeter rounds from the whole

millimeter rounds from the whole
strafing<00:02:57.010> run<00:02:57.340> it<00:02:57.520> is<00:02:58.270> very<00:02:58.480> useful<00:02:58.540> or<00:02:59.170> own

00:02:59.430 --> 00:02:59.440 
strafing run it is very useful or own

00:02:59.440 --> 00:03:01.560 
strafing run it is very useful or own
counsel<00:02:59.890> situation<00:03:00.460> from<00:03:00.850> escaping<00:03:01.330> the

00:03:03.670 --> 00:03:06.270 
battle or for defending yourself it just
really<00:03:03.940> helps<00:03:04.060> a<00:03:04.240> lot<00:03:04.390> for<00:03:05.350> the<00:03:05.500> optic<00:03:05.890> section

00:03:06.270 --> 00:03:06.280 
really helps a lot for the optic section

00:03:06.280 --> 00:03:08.580 
really helps a lot for the optic section
I<00:03:06.430> you<00:03:06.550> zoom<00:03:06.970> optics<00:03:07.450> because<00:03:07.840> I<00:03:08.110> find<00:03:08.410> the

00:03:08.580 --> 00:03:08.590 
I you zoom optics because I find the

00:03:08.590 --> 00:03:11.070 
I you zoom optics because I find the
other<00:03:08.800> two<00:03:08.890> objects<00:03:09.490> such<00:03:09.700> as<00:03:09.730> I<00:03:10.150> R&amp;B<00:03:10.630> optics

00:03:11.070 --> 00:03:11.080 
other two objects such as I R&amp;B optics

00:03:11.080 --> 00:03:13.410 
other two objects such as I R&amp;B optics
and<00:03:11.260> thermal<00:03:11.710> optics<00:03:11.770> aren't<00:03:12.310> very<00:03:12.460> good<00:03:12.550> you

00:03:13.410 --> 00:03:13.420 
and thermal optics aren't very good you

00:03:13.420 --> 00:03:15.150 
and thermal optics aren't very good you
just<00:03:13.600> can't<00:03:13.780> see<00:03:13.930> very<00:03:13.960> far<00:03:14.290> away<00:03:14.650> from<00:03:14.950> them

00:03:15.150 --> 00:03:15.160 
just can't see very far away from them

00:03:15.160 --> 00:03:17.340 
just can't see very far away from them
and<00:03:15.400> when<00:03:15.880> I<00:03:15.910> first<00:03:16.240> got<00:03:16.480> them<00:03:16.750> I<00:03:16.930> can't

00:03:17.340 --> 00:03:17.350 
and when I first got them I can't

00:03:17.350 --> 00:03:19.260 
and when I first got them I can't
expected<00:03:17.860> it<00:03:17.980> for<00:03:18.160> me<00:03:18.340> to<00:03:18.490> see<00:03:18.640> enemies<00:03:18.940> from

00:03:19.260 --> 00:03:19.270 
expected it for me to see enemies from

00:03:19.270 --> 00:03:21.540 
expected it for me to see enemies from
very<00:03:19.570> far<00:03:19.660> away<00:03:19.870> but<00:03:20.710> that<00:03:21.010> was<00:03:21.130> not<00:03:21.250> the<00:03:21.310> case

00:03:21.540 --> 00:03:21.550 
very far away but that was not the case

00:03:21.550 --> 00:03:23.190 
very far away but that was not the case
so<00:03:21.850> you<00:03:22.030> all<00:03:22.570> think<00:03:22.780> it<00:03:22.840> was<00:03:22.960> the<00:03:23.020> perfect

00:03:23.190 --> 00:03:23.200 
so you all think it was the perfect

00:03:23.200 --> 00:03:25.320 
so you all think it was the perfect
choice<00:03:23.440> for<00:03:23.590> me<00:03:23.890> because<00:03:24.610> it<00:03:24.640> just<00:03:24.970> really

00:03:25.320 --> 00:03:25.330 
choice for me because it just really

00:03:25.330 --> 00:03:27.000 
choice for me because it just really
allows<00:03:25.630> me<00:03:25.900> to<00:03:26.020> spot<00:03:26.260> enemy<00:03:26.590> some<00:03:26.770> far<00:03:26.980> away

00:03:27.000 --> 00:03:27.010 
allows me to spot enemy some far away

00:03:27.010 --> 00:03:29.460 
allows me to spot enemy some far away
and<00:03:27.430> then<00:03:27.490> I<00:03:28.210> can<00:03:28.450> try<00:03:28.690> to<00:03:28.720> use<00:03:29.080> the<00:03:29.260> best

00:03:29.460 --> 00:03:29.470 
and then I can try to use the best

00:03:29.470 --> 00:03:31.170 
and then I can try to use the best
possible<00:03:29.710> way<00:03:30.010> to<00:03:30.100> get<00:03:30.400> close<00:03:30.580> to<00:03:30.700> the<00:03:30.970> target

00:03:31.170 --> 00:03:31.180 
possible way to get close to the target

00:03:31.180 --> 00:03:34.770 
possible way to get close to the target
and<00:03:31.570> kill<00:03:31.990> or<00:03:32.290> destroy<00:03:32.650> it<00:03:33.010> and<00:03:33.450> lastly<00:03:34.450> for

00:03:34.770 --> 00:03:34.780 
and kill or destroy it and lastly for

00:03:34.780 --> 00:03:36.090 
and kill or destroy it and lastly for
the<00:03:34.870> upgrade<00:03:34.990> section<00:03:35.470> I<00:03:35.620> am<00:03:35.830> currently

to help you through a little faster so

00:03:47.830 --> 00:03:49.320 
to help you through a little faster so
there's<00:03:48.250> not<00:03:48.400> really<00:03:48.550> any<00:03:48.760> point<00:03:49.030> of<00:03:49.180> running

00:03:49.320 --> 00:03:49.330 
there's not really any point of running

00:03:49.330 --> 00:03:51.570 
there's not really any point of running
it<00:03:49.570> and<00:03:49.720> yes<00:03:50.440> I<00:03:50.650> know<00:03:50.680> I<00:03:50.950> don't<00:03:51.220> really<00:03:51.430> have

00:03:51.570 --> 00:03:51.580 
it and yes I know I don't really have

00:03:51.580 --> 00:03:54.030 
it and yes I know I don't really have
much<00:03:51.850> proof<00:03:52.180> of<00:03:52.360> that<00:03:52.480> is<00:03:52.540> broken<00:03:53.170> but<00:03:53.500> I<00:03:53.800> did

00:03:54.030 --> 00:03:54.040 
much proof of that is broken but I did

00:03:54.040 --> 00:03:56.190 
much proof of that is broken but I did
test<00:03:54.310> out<00:03:54.460> the<00:03:54.580> reload<00:03:54.880> time<00:03:54.910> and<00:03:55.450> it<00:03:55.870> didn't

00:03:56.190 --> 00:03:56.200 
test out the reload time and it didn't

00:03:56.200 --> 00:03:59.100 
test out the reload time and it didn't
seem<00:03:56.380> like<00:03:56.410> a<00:03:56.650> benefit<00:03:57.190> at<00:03:57.340> all<00:03:57.420> so<00:03:58.420> take<00:03:58.960> what

00:03:59.100 --> 00:03:59.110 
seem like a benefit at all so take what

00:03:59.110 --> 00:04:00.660 
seem like a benefit at all so take what
you<00:03:59.230> ever<00:03:59.380> you<00:03:59.530> like<00:03:59.560> from<00:03:59.890> this<00:04:00.040> video<00:04:00.310> but

00:04:00.660 --> 00:04:00.670 
you ever you like from this video but

00:04:00.670 --> 00:04:02.160 
you ever you like from this video but
not<00:04:00.940> everything<00:04:01.300> is<00:04:01.720> a<00:04:01.750> hundred<00:04:02.050> percent

00:04:02.160 --> 00:04:02.170 
not everything is a hundred percent

00:04:02.170 --> 00:04:04.980 
not everything is a hundred percent
confirmed<00:04:02.800> now<00:04:03.610> I<00:04:03.640> do<00:04:03.970> use<00:04:04.330> maintenance

00:04:04.980 --> 00:04:04.990 
confirmed now I do use maintenance

00:04:04.990 --> 00:04:06.930 
confirmed now I do use maintenance
because<00:04:05.200> I<00:04:05.380> like<00:04:05.680> to<00:04:05.710> heal<00:04:05.950> quickly<00:04:06.250> since<00:04:06.730> I

00:04:06.930 --> 00:04:06.940 
because I like to heal quickly since I

00:04:06.940 --> 00:04:08.760 
because I like to heal quickly since I
played<00:04:07.000> very<00:04:07.510> aggressively<00:04:07.990> with<00:04:08.320> the<00:04:08.470> attack

00:04:08.760 --> 00:04:08.770 
played very aggressively with the attack

00:04:08.770 --> 00:04:10.270 
played very aggressively with the attack
boats<00:04:08.980> and<00:04:09.250> I<00:04:09.850> use

00:04:10.270 --> 00:04:10.280 
boats and I use

00:04:10.280 --> 00:04:12.150 
boats and I use
get<00:04:10.430> myself<00:04:10.610> damaged<00:04:11.180> very<00:04:11.420> quickly<00:04:11.720> and

00:04:12.150 --> 00:04:12.160 
get myself damaged very quickly and

00:04:12.160 --> 00:04:14.470 
get myself damaged very quickly and
sometimes<00:04:13.160> I<00:04:13.370> run<00:04:13.640> proximity<00:04:14.209> scanner

00:04:14.470 --> 00:04:14.480 
sometimes I run proximity scanner

00:04:14.480 --> 00:04:16.240 
sometimes I run proximity scanner
because<00:04:14.959> I<00:04:14.990> like<00:04:15.380> to<00:04:15.500> know<00:04:15.560> where<00:04:15.890> all<00:04:15.920> the

00:04:16.240 --> 00:04:16.250 
because I like to know where all the

00:04:16.250 --> 00:04:17.920 
because I like to know where all the
enemies<00:04:16.400> are<00:04:16.579> so<00:04:17.120> I<00:04:17.150> can<00:04:17.389> find<00:04:17.630> the<00:04:17.720> best

00:04:17.920 --> 00:04:17.930 
enemies are so I can find the best

00:04:17.930 --> 00:04:19.240 
enemies are so I can find the best
possible<00:04:18.109> way<00:04:18.380> to<00:04:18.560> kill<00:04:18.889> them<00:04:19.010> without

00:04:19.240 --> 00:04:19.250 
possible way to kill them without

00:04:19.250 --> 00:04:21.699 
possible way to kill them without
getting<00:04:19.790> myself<00:04:19.910> hurt<00:04:20.389> that<00:04:21.260> was<00:04:21.410> just<00:04:21.590> my

00:04:21.699 --> 00:04:21.709 
getting myself hurt that was just my

00:04:21.709 --> 00:04:23.080 
getting myself hurt that was just my

just want to talk a bit about more of
the<00:04:41.389> problems<00:04:41.870> and<00:04:42.110> disadvantages<00:04:42.980> while

00:04:43.240 --> 00:04:43.250 
the problems and disadvantages while

00:04:43.250 --> 00:04:45.250 
the problems and disadvantages while
using<00:04:43.580> some<00:04:43.880> of<00:04:43.910> the<00:04:44.120> unlocks<00:04:44.540> on<00:04:44.810> the<00:04:45.020> attack

00:04:45.250 --> 00:04:45.260 
using some of the unlocks on the attack

00:04:45.260 --> 00:04:47.020 
using some of the unlocks on the attack
boats<00:04:45.470> because<00:04:46.010> I<00:04:46.220> believe<00:04:46.640> some<00:04:46.790> of<00:04:46.820> them

00:04:47.020 --> 00:04:47.030 
boats because I believe some of them

00:04:47.030 --> 00:04:48.520 
boats because I believe some of them
there's<00:04:47.240> nothing<00:04:47.660> and<00:04:47.930> so<00:04:48.260> much<00:04:48.410> is

00:04:48.520 --> 00:04:48.530 
there's nothing and so much is

00:04:48.530 --> 00:04:50.860 
there's nothing and so much is
overpowered<00:04:49.190> so<00:04:49.970> I'll<00:04:50.270> scroll<00:04:50.510> down<00:04:50.690> the<00:04:50.840> list

00:04:50.860 --> 00:04:50.870 
overpowered so I'll scroll down the list

00:04:50.870 --> 00:04:53.320 
overpowered so I'll scroll down the list
in<00:04:51.230> the<00:04:51.320> order<00:04:51.620> you<00:04:51.800> unlock<00:04:52.220> them<00:04:52.490> but<00:04:53.060> only

00:04:53.320 --> 00:04:53.330 
in the order you unlock them but only

00:04:53.330 --> 00:04:56.010 
in the order you unlock them but only
thinking<00:04:53.870> the<00:04:53.960> ones<00:04:54.169> which<00:04:54.470> has<00:04:54.770> a<00:04:54.800> problem

00:04:56.010 --> 00:04:56.020 
thinking the ones which has a problem

00:04:56.020 --> 00:04:58.150 
thinking the ones which has a problem
firstly<00:04:57.020> I<00:04:57.050> want<00:04:57.290> to<00:04:57.410> talk<00:04:57.530> about<00:04:57.560> the<00:04:57.800> thermal

00:04:58.150 --> 00:04:58.160 
firstly I want to talk about the thermal

00:04:58.160 --> 00:05:00.640 
firstly I want to talk about the thermal
camera<00:04:58.190> now<00:04:59.060> honestly<00:04:59.330> I<00:04:59.720> really<00:04:59.930> don't<00:05:00.350> think

00:05:00.640 --> 00:05:00.650 
camera now honestly I really don't think

00:05:00.650 --> 00:05:02.350 
camera now honestly I really don't think
there's<00:05:00.980> a<00:05:01.070> point<00:05:01.280> of<00:05:01.460> using<00:05:01.700> this<00:05:01.940> because

00:05:02.350 --> 00:05:02.360 
there's a point of using this because

00:05:02.360 --> 00:05:04.240 
there's a point of using this because
most<00:05:02.690> players<00:05:02.930> will<00:05:03.169> not<00:05:03.380> lock<00:05:03.620> on<00:05:03.860> to<00:05:04.070> you

00:05:04.240 --> 00:05:04.250 
most players will not lock on to you

00:05:04.250 --> 00:05:06.250 
most players will not lock on to you
when<00:05:04.460> you're<00:05:04.610> in<00:05:04.640> da<00:05:04.850> attack<00:05:05.150> boats<00:05:05.390> and<00:05:05.660> I

00:05:06.250 --> 00:05:06.260 
when you're in da attack boats and I

00:05:06.260 --> 00:05:07.450 
when you're in da attack boats and I
really<00:05:06.530> don't<00:05:06.770> see<00:05:06.830> the<00:05:06.979> difference<00:05:07.190> between

00:05:07.450 --> 00:05:07.460 
really don't see the difference between

00:05:07.460 --> 00:05:09.760 
really don't see the difference between
a<00:05:07.760> while<00:05:07.940> using<00:05:08.180> it<00:05:08.419> or<00:05:08.570> not<00:05:08.870> using<00:05:09.229> it<00:05:09.380> but

00:05:09.760 --> 00:05:09.770 
a while using it or not using it but

00:05:09.770 --> 00:05:11.680 
a while using it or not using it but
that's<00:05:10.040> in<00:05:10.130> my<00:05:10.160> opinion<00:05:10.550> and<00:05:10.910> you<00:05:11.210> may<00:05:11.479> not

00:05:11.680 --> 00:05:11.690 
that's in my opinion and you may not

00:05:11.690 --> 00:05:14.710 
that's in my opinion and you may not
agree<00:05:11.900> with<00:05:12.169> me<00:05:13.000> next<00:05:14.000> is<00:05:14.090> the<00:05:14.120> passive<00:05:14.419> radar

00:05:14.710 --> 00:05:14.720 
agree with me next is the passive radar

00:05:14.720 --> 00:05:16.750 
agree with me next is the passive radar
missiles<00:05:15.260> they<00:05:15.560> aren't<00:05:15.860> overpowered<00:05:16.490> but

00:05:16.750 --> 00:05:16.760 
missiles they aren't overpowered but

00:05:16.760 --> 00:05:18.850 
missiles they aren't overpowered but
they<00:05:17.000> are<00:05:17.150> very<00:05:17.180> spammable<00:05:17.870> since<00:05:18.620> they<00:05:18.800> do

00:05:18.850 --> 00:05:18.860 
they are very spammable since they do

00:05:18.860 --> 00:05:20.469 
they are very spammable since they do
come<00:05:19.010> in<00:05:19.280> a<00:05:19.310> magazine<00:05:19.520> of<00:05:19.880> two<00:05:20.060> missiles

00:05:20.469 --> 00:05:20.479 
come in a magazine of two missiles

00:05:20.479 --> 00:05:22.659 
come in a magazine of two missiles
default<00:05:20.960> and<00:05:21.140> they<00:05:21.530> take<00:05:21.860> two<00:05:22.130> more<00:05:22.280> missiles

00:05:22.659 --> 00:05:22.669 
default and they take two more missiles

00:05:22.669 --> 00:05:25.030 
default and they take two more missiles
in<00:05:22.820> his<00:05:22.940> ammo<00:05:23.150> count<00:05:23.419> meaning<00:05:24.290> you<00:05:24.440> can<00:05:24.590> reload

00:05:25.030 --> 00:05:25.040 
in his ammo count meaning you can reload

00:05:25.040 --> 00:05:27.040 
in his ammo count meaning you can reload
quickly<00:05:25.220> only<00:05:25.820> ten<00:05:26.030> six<00:05:26.330> seconds<00:05:26.780> and<00:05:26.930> then

00:05:27.040 --> 00:05:27.050 
quickly only ten six seconds and then

00:05:27.050 --> 00:05:29.080 
quickly only ten six seconds and then
fire<00:05:27.350> again<00:05:27.590> at<00:05:27.740> the<00:05:27.830> aircraft<00:05:28.280> and<00:05:28.430> maybe<00:05:28.850> you

00:05:29.080 --> 00:05:29.090 
fire again at the aircraft and maybe you

00:05:29.090 --> 00:05:31.840 
fire again at the aircraft and maybe you
will<00:05:29.180> take<00:05:29.330> it<00:05:29.450> down<00:05:30.130> smokescreen<00:05:31.130> is<00:05:31.430> next

00:05:31.840 --> 00:05:31.850 
will take it down smokescreen is next

00:05:31.850 --> 00:05:33.850 
will take it down smokescreen is next
and<00:05:31.940> I<00:05:32.300> really<00:05:32.840> find<00:05:32.990> it<00:05:33.140> not<00:05:33.289> effective

00:05:33.850 --> 00:05:33.860 
and I really find it not effective

00:05:33.860 --> 00:05:35.590 
and I really find it not effective
enough<00:05:34.100> I<00:05:34.310> would<00:05:34.640> imagine<00:05:34.729> it<00:05:35.180> will<00:05:35.450> almost

00:05:35.590 --> 00:05:35.600 
enough I would imagine it will almost

00:05:35.600 --> 00:05:37.480 
enough I would imagine it will almost
make<00:05:35.960> you<00:05:35.990> disappear<00:05:36.289> since<00:05:36.950> you're<00:05:37.190> training

00:05:37.480 --> 00:05:37.490 
make you disappear since you're training

00:05:37.490 --> 00:05:39.460 
make you disappear since you're training
the<00:05:37.580> benefit<00:05:38.000> of<00:05:38.030> dodging<00:05:38.660> lock<00:05:38.900> on<00:05:39.080> missiles

00:05:39.460 --> 00:05:39.470 
the benefit of dodging lock on missiles

00:05:39.470 --> 00:05:41.830 
the benefit of dodging lock on missiles
for<00:05:39.740> you<00:05:39.890> to<00:05:40.070> be<00:05:40.160> harder<00:05:40.460> to<00:05:40.490> be<00:05:40.729> seen<00:05:41.000> I<00:05:41.270> just

00:05:41.830 --> 00:05:41.840 
for you to be harder to be seen I just

00:05:41.840 --> 00:05:43.360 
for you to be harder to be seen I just
hope<00:05:42.020> dies<00:05:42.229> either<00:05:42.500> makes<00:05:42.860> the<00:05:43.010> smokescreen

00:05:43.360 --> 00:05:43.370 
hope dies either makes the smokescreen

00:05:43.370 --> 00:05:45.310 
hope dies either makes the smokescreen
hard<00:05:43.700> to<00:05:43.820> see<00:05:44.060> you<00:05:44.120> through<00:05:44.390> or<00:05:44.630> makes<00:05:44.960> a<00:05:45.080> smoke

00:05:45.310 --> 00:05:45.320 
hard to see you through or makes a smoke

00:05:45.320 --> 00:05:47.920 
hard to see you through or makes a smoke
last<00:05:45.590> longer<00:05:46.100> if<00:05:46.280> they<00:05:46.970> don't<00:05:47.240> change<00:05:47.300> this<00:05:47.660> it

00:05:47.920 --> 00:05:47.930 
last longer if they don't change this it

00:05:47.930 --> 00:05:49.810 
last longer if they don't change this it
will<00:05:48.020> turn<00:05:48.140> this<00:05:48.289> unlock<00:05:48.620> from<00:05:48.890> under<00:05:49.220> used<00:05:49.490> to

00:05:49.810 --> 00:05:49.820 
will turn this unlock from under used to

00:05:49.820 --> 00:05:52.930 
will turn this unlock from under used to
unused<00:05:50.470> then<00:05:51.470> we<00:05:51.770> have<00:05:51.830> proximity<00:05:52.100> scan<00:05:52.700> and

00:05:52.930 --> 00:05:52.940 
unused then we have proximity scan and

00:05:52.940 --> 00:05:55.360 
unused then we have proximity scan and
currently<00:05:53.600> at<00:05:53.840> this<00:05:54.140> day<00:05:54.410> I<00:05:54.440> have<00:05:54.710> no<00:05:54.919> problems

00:05:55.360 --> 00:05:55.370 
currently at this day I have no problems

00:05:55.370 --> 00:05:57.610 
currently at this day I have no problems
with<00:05:55.430> it<00:05:55.610> since<00:05:56.120> it<00:05:56.360> works<00:05:56.570> normally<00:05:56.780> and<00:05:57.260> not

00:05:57.610 --> 00:05:57.620 
with it since it works normally and not

00:05:57.620 --> 00:05:59.980 
with it since it works normally and not
too<00:05:57.800> powerful<00:05:58.280> it<00:05:58.820> can<00:05:59.060> be<00:05:59.300> useful<00:05:59.720> if<00:05:59.870> you

00:05:59.980 --> 00:05:59.990 
too powerful it can be useful if you

00:05:59.990 --> 00:06:01.659 
too powerful it can be useful if you
know<00:06:00.229> how<00:06:00.380> to<00:06:00.410> utilize<00:06:00.919> this<00:06:01.070> unlock<00:06:01.400> your

00:06:01.659 --> 00:06:01.669 
know how to utilize this unlock your

00:06:01.669 --> 00:06:03.580 
know how to utilize this unlock your
advantage<00:06:02.030> or<00:06:02.240> else<00:06:02.539> it<00:06:02.810> could<00:06:02.990> feel<00:06:03.200> like<00:06:03.440> is

00:06:03.580 --> 00:06:03.590 
advantage or else it could feel like is

00:06:03.590 --> 00:06:06.700 
advantage or else it could feel like is
a<00:06:03.620> total<00:06:04.039> waste<00:06:04.190> of<00:06:04.340> unlock<00:06:04.760> space<00:06:05.380> then<00:06:06.380> there

00:06:06.700 --> 00:06:06.710 
a total waste of unlock space then there

00:06:06.710 --> 00:06:08.440 
a total waste of unlock space then there
are<00:06:06.830> the<00:06:06.919> cannons<00:06:07.310> now<00:06:07.610> I<00:06:07.640> think<00:06:08.180> all<00:06:08.330> the

00:06:08.440 --> 00:06:08.450 
are the cannons now I think all the

00:06:08.450 --> 00:06:10.330 
are the cannons now I think all the
cannons<00:06:08.810> except<00:06:09.260> for<00:06:09.289> the<00:06:09.440> burst<00:06:09.710> canon<00:06:10.070> has

00:06:10.330 --> 00:06:10.340 
cannons except for the burst canon has

00:06:10.340 --> 00:06:12.760 
cannons except for the burst canon has
no<00:06:10.610> problems<00:06:11.090> they<00:06:11.780> don't<00:06:12.080> do<00:06:12.229> extra<00:06:12.530> amount

00:06:12.760 --> 00:06:12.770 
no problems they don't do extra amount

00:06:12.770 --> 00:06:15.010 
no problems they don't do extra amount
of<00:06:12.890> damage<00:06:13.250> to<00:06:13.280> armored<00:06:13.700> vehicles<00:06:14.180> so<00:06:14.720> they

00:06:15.010 --> 00:06:15.020 
of damage to armored vehicles so they

00:06:15.020 --> 00:06:15.820 
of damage to armored vehicles so they
aren't<00:06:15.200> really

00:06:15.820 --> 00:06:15.830 
aren't really

00:06:15.830 --> 00:06:18.580 
aren't really
balance<00:06:16.340> and<00:06:16.520> yes<00:06:17.150> they<00:06:17.450> do<00:06:17.690> rip<00:06:17.900> out<00:06:18.050> infantry

00:06:18.580 --> 00:06:18.590 
balance and yes they do rip out infantry

00:06:18.590 --> 00:06:20.290 
balance and yes they do rip out infantry
but<00:06:18.920> that's<00:06:19.280> not<00:06:19.400> a<00:06:19.460> huge<00:06:19.760> problem<00:06:19.790> in<00:06:20.210> my

00:06:20.290 --> 00:06:20.300 
but that's not a huge problem in my

00:06:20.300 --> 00:06:22.330 
but that's not a huge problem in my
opinion<00:06:20.540> because<00:06:20.900> I<00:06:21.320> don't<00:06:21.530> often<00:06:21.770> get<00:06:22.070> killed

00:06:22.330 --> 00:06:22.340 
opinion because I don't often get killed

00:06:22.340 --> 00:06:24.580 
opinion because I don't often get killed
by<00:06:22.460> them<00:06:22.640> but<00:06:23.360> the<00:06:23.510> problem<00:06:23.840> is<00:06:24.050> the<00:06:24.350> burst

00:06:24.580 --> 00:06:24.590 
by them but the problem is the burst

00:06:24.590 --> 00:06:26.740 
by them but the problem is the burst
cannon<00:06:24.950> they<00:06:25.370> fire<00:06:25.640> the<00:06:25.850> 25<00:06:26.270> millimeter

00:06:26.740 --> 00:06:26.750 
cannon they fire the 25 millimeter

00:06:26.750 --> 00:06:29.080 
cannon they fire the 25 millimeter
rounds<00:06:27.260> since<00:06:27.650> in<00:06:27.980> theory<00:06:28.520> each<00:06:28.700> bullet

00:06:29.080 --> 00:06:29.090 
rounds since in theory each bullet

00:06:29.090 --> 00:06:31.120 
rounds since in theory each bullet
should<00:06:29.390> do<00:06:29.720> the<00:06:29.900> same<00:06:29.930> amount<00:06:30.380> of<00:06:30.590> damage<00:06:30.980> as

00:06:31.120 --> 00:06:31.130 
should do the same amount of damage as

00:06:31.130 --> 00:06:32.590 
should do the same amount of damage as
one<00:06:31.430> of<00:06:31.460> the<00:06:31.610> bullets<00:06:31.790> from<00:06:32.030> the<00:06:32.120> 25

00:06:32.590 --> 00:06:32.600 
one of the bullets from the 25

00:06:32.600 --> 00:06:35.020 
one of the bullets from the 25
millimeter<00:06:33.110> cannon<00:06:33.530> but<00:06:34.250> the<00:06:34.430> burst<00:06:34.670> cannon

00:06:35.020 --> 00:06:35.030 
millimeter cannon but the burst cannon

00:06:35.030 --> 00:06:37.570 
millimeter cannon but the burst cannon
fires<00:06:35.390> in<00:06:35.600> the<00:06:35.630> eighth<00:06:35.840> round<00:06:35.990> vs<00:06:36.470> so<00:06:37.010> if<00:06:37.310> you

00:06:37.570 --> 00:06:37.580 
fires in the eighth round vs so if you

00:06:37.580 --> 00:06:39.640 
fires in the eighth round vs so if you
pull<00:06:37.970> the<00:06:38.090> trigger<00:06:38.180> fast<00:06:38.540> enough<00:06:38.870> it<00:06:39.080> will<00:06:39.350> far

00:06:39.640 --> 00:06:39.650 
pull the trigger fast enough it will far

00:06:39.650 --> 00:06:41.860 
pull the trigger fast enough it will far
like<00:06:39.890> it<00:06:40.100> was<00:06:40.250> automatic<00:06:40.640> but<00:06:41.180> at<00:06:41.450> a<00:06:41.510> way

00:06:41.860 --> 00:06:41.870 
like it was automatic but at a way

00:06:41.870 --> 00:06:44.140 
like it was automatic but at a way
higher<00:06:42.110> rpm<00:06:42.650> than<00:06:42.890> the<00:06:42.980> 25<00:06:43.370> millimeter<00:06:43.790> cannon

00:06:44.140 --> 00:06:44.150 
higher rpm than the 25 millimeter cannon

00:06:44.150 --> 00:06:46.750 
higher rpm than the 25 millimeter cannon
so<00:06:44.810> basically<00:06:45.290> it<00:06:45.620> just<00:06:45.680> both<00:06:46.040> the<00:06:46.310> 25

00:06:46.750 --> 00:06:46.760 
so basically it just both the 25

00:06:46.760 --> 00:06:48.430 
so basically it just both the 25
millimeter<00:06:47.180> cannon<00:06:47.540> out<00:06:47.690> the<00:06:47.870> water<00:06:48.110> and

00:06:48.430 --> 00:06:48.440 
millimeter cannon out the water and

00:06:48.440 --> 00:06:50.500 
millimeter cannon out the water and
there<00:06:48.980> is<00:06:49.070> no<00:06:49.190> point<00:06:49.430> of<00:06:49.640> not<00:06:49.820> switching<00:06:50.180> to<00:06:50.360> it

00:06:50.500 --> 00:06:50.510 
there is no point of not switching to it

00:06:50.510 --> 00:06:52.540 
there is no point of not switching to it
and<00:06:50.690> if<00:06:51.230> you<00:06:51.410> actually<00:06:51.680> don't<00:06:52.040> switch<00:06:52.250> you<00:06:52.430> it

00:06:52.540 --> 00:06:52.550 
and if you actually don't switch you it

00:06:52.550 --> 00:06:54.580 
and if you actually don't switch you it
would<00:06:52.850> be<00:06:52.910> a<00:06:53.030> disadvantage<00:06:53.660> compared<00:06:54.440> the

00:06:54.580 --> 00:06:54.590 
would be a disadvantage compared the

00:06:54.590 --> 00:06:57.670 
would be a disadvantage compared the
other<00:06:54.890> ones<00:06:55.540> lastly<00:06:56.540> if<00:06:56.750> you<00:06:56.840> watch<00:06:57.050> my<00:06:57.080> part<00:06:57.500> 1

00:06:57.670 --> 00:06:57.680 
other ones lastly if you watch my part 1

00:06:57.680 --> 00:06:59.050 
other ones lastly if you watch my part 1
video<00:06:57.860> then<00:06:58.310> you'll<00:06:58.520> know<00:06:58.700> the<00:06:58.850> facts

00:06:59.050 --> 00:06:59.060 
video then you'll know the facts

00:06:59.060 --> 00:07:01.150 
video then you'll know the facts
tincture<00:06:59.480> is<00:06:59.510> broken<00:06:59.930> for<00:07:00.080> me<00:07:00.230> at<00:07:00.380> least<00:07:00.410> it

00:07:01.150 --> 00:07:01.160 
tincture is broken for me at least it

00:07:01.160 --> 00:07:03.070 
tincture is broken for me at least it
just<00:07:01.370> doesn't<00:07:01.550> work<00:07:01.820> and<00:07:02.120> i<00:07:02.450> hope<00:07:02.690> that<00:07:02.750> so

00:07:03.070 --> 00:07:03.080 
just doesn't work and i hope that so

00:07:03.080 --> 00:07:05.200 
just doesn't work and i hope that so
fixes<00:07:03.530> but<00:07:03.890> if<00:07:04.160> they<00:07:04.310> don't<00:07:04.490> i<00:07:04.730> really<00:07:04.970> want

00:07:05.200 --> 00:07:05.210 
fixes but if they don't i really want

00:07:05.210 --> 00:07:07.420 
fixes but if they don't i really want
notices<00:07:05.690> because<00:07:06.140> i<00:07:06.350> was<00:07:06.620> never<00:07:06.800> really<00:07:07.070> a<00:07:07.190> big

00:07:07.420 --> 00:07:07.430 
notices because i was never really a big

00:07:07.430 --> 00:07:09.460 
notices because i was never really a big
fan<00:07:07.460> of<00:07:07.670> the<00:07:07.910> fire<00:07:08.060> extinguisher<00:07:08.600> in<00:07:08.780> val<00:07:08.990> 43

00:07:09.460 --> 00:07:09.470 
fan of the fire extinguisher in val 43

00:07:09.470 --> 00:07:11.820 
fan of the fire extinguisher in val 43
and<00:07:09.710> I'm<00:07:09.980> not<00:07:10.220> involved<00:07:10.820> before<00:07:11.000> either

00:07:11.820 --> 00:07:11.830 
and I'm not involved before either

00:07:11.830 --> 00:07:13.810 
and I'm not involved before either
anyways<00:07:12.830> those<00:07:13.220> are<00:07:13.250> just<00:07:13.460> some<00:07:13.610> of<00:07:13.670> the

00:07:13.810 --> 00:07:13.820 
anyways those are just some of the

00:07:13.820 --> 00:07:15.160 
anyways those are just some of the
biggest<00:07:14.000> problem<00:07:14.210> is<00:07:14.510> my<00:07:14.630> opinion<00:07:14.870> with<00:07:15.140> the

00:07:15.160 --> 00:07:15.170 
biggest problem is my opinion with the

00:07:15.170 --> 00:07:17.470 
biggest problem is my opinion with the
attack<00:07:15.530> boats<00:07:15.740> I'm<00:07:16.010> sure<00:07:16.610> looking<00:07:16.910> time<00:07:17.180> those

00:07:17.470 --> 00:07:17.480 
attack boats I'm sure looking time those

00:07:17.480 --> 00:07:18.640 
attack boats I'm sure looking time those
will<00:07:17.630> fix<00:07:17.810> all<00:07:17.960> these<00:07:18.110> problems<00:07:18.350> and

00:07:18.640 --> 00:07:18.650 
will fix all these problems and

00:07:18.650 --> 00:07:20.650 
will fix all these problems and
hopefully<00:07:19.340> the<00:07:19.550> attempt<00:07:19.850> it<00:07:20.030> will<00:07:20.300> become

00:07:20.650 --> 00:07:20.660 
hopefully the attempt it will become

00:07:20.660 --> 00:07:22.030 
hopefully the attempt it will become
even<00:07:20.810> more<00:07:20.990> balanced<00:07:21.470> at<00:07:21.560> the<00:07:21.620> rest<00:07:21.830> of<00:07:21.950> the

00:07:22.030 --> 00:07:22.040 
even more balanced at the rest of the

00:07:22.040 --> 00:07:24.370 
even more balanced at the rest of the
game<00:07:22.250> once<00:07:23.210> I<00:07:23.360> get<00:07:23.540> enough<00:07:23.810> experience<00:07:24.140> with

00:07:24.370 --> 00:07:24.380 
game once I get enough experience with

00:07:24.380 --> 00:07:26.260 
game once I get enough experience with
the<00:07:24.530> tap<00:07:24.770> boats<00:07:25.010> I<00:07:25.220> will<00:07:25.610> try<00:07:25.820> to<00:07:25.910> make<00:07:26.030> a<00:07:26.120> good

00:07:26.260 --> 00:07:26.270
