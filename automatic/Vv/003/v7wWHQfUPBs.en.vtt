hi my name is Reynold Chabot I'd like to
share<00:00:09.330> with<00:00:09.540> you<00:00:09.690> today<00:00:09.870> the<00:00:10.320> real<00:00:10.559> reason<00:00:11.190> why

00:00:11.360 --> 00:00:11.370 
share with you today the real reason why

00:00:11.370 --> 00:00:13.430 
share with you today the real reason why
guitars<00:00:11.940> go<00:00:12.299> out<00:00:12.480> of<00:00:12.629> tune<00:00:12.840> while<00:00:13.260> you're

00:00:13.430 --> 00:00:13.440 
guitars go out of tune while you're

00:00:13.440 --> 00:00:17.870 
guitars go out of tune while you're
playing<00:00:13.650> all<00:00:13.950> the<00:00:14.130> time<00:00:15.830> it<00:00:16.830> all<00:00:16.950> occurs<00:00:17.369> at

00:00:17.870 --> 00:00:17.880 
playing all the time it all occurs at

00:00:17.880 --> 00:00:22.730 
playing all the time it all occurs at
the<00:00:18.599> nut<00:00:19.759> hardly<00:00:20.759> ever<00:00:20.970> anywhere<00:00:21.960> else<00:00:22.289> on

00:00:22.730 --> 00:00:22.740 
the nut hardly ever anywhere else on

00:00:22.740 --> 00:00:27.019 
the nut hardly ever anywhere else on
your<00:00:23.130> instrument<00:00:25.100> the<00:00:26.100> reason<00:00:26.460> why<00:00:26.609> I<00:00:26.640> say

00:00:27.019 --> 00:00:27.029 
your instrument the reason why I say

00:00:27.029 --> 00:00:29.060 
your instrument the reason why I say
this<00:00:27.060> is<00:00:27.510> because<00:00:27.539> to<00:00:28.470> give<00:00:28.590> you<00:00:28.680> a<00:00:28.710> little<00:00:28.920> bit

00:00:29.060 --> 00:00:29.070 
this is because to give you a little bit

00:00:29.070 --> 00:00:32.150 
this is because to give you a little bit
of<00:00:29.369> background<00:00:29.640> on<00:00:30.060> myself<00:00:30.380> I've<00:00:31.380> been<00:00:31.679> I've

of background on myself I've been I've
been<00:00:32.220> playing<00:00:32.669> guitar<00:00:32.879> for<00:00:33.180> over<00:00:33.900> 60<00:00:34.320> years

00:00:35.590 --> 00:00:35.600 
been playing guitar for over 60 years

00:00:35.600 --> 00:00:39.920 
been playing guitar for over 60 years
and<00:00:36.620> it's<00:00:37.620> a<00:00:37.739> sickness<00:00:38.190> I<00:00:38.339> can't<00:00:38.580> quit<00:00:38.930> it's

00:00:39.920 --> 00:00:39.930 
and it's a sickness I can't quit it's

00:00:39.930 --> 00:00:42.890 
and it's a sickness I can't quit it's
just<00:00:40.140> so<00:00:40.290> much<00:00:40.440> fun<00:00:40.739> and<00:00:41.390> what<00:00:42.390> I<00:00:42.420> do<00:00:42.540> for<00:00:42.839> a

00:00:42.890 --> 00:00:42.900 
just so much fun and what I do for a

00:00:42.900 --> 00:00:45.380 
just so much fun and what I do for a
living<00:00:43.320> however<00:00:43.739> is<00:00:43.979> I<00:00:44.610> do<00:00:44.670> a<00:00:44.850> design

00:00:45.380 --> 00:00:45.390 
living however is I do a design

00:00:45.390 --> 00:00:49.640 
living however is I do a design
engineering<00:00:45.989> and<00:00:46.739> so<00:00:47.250> my<00:00:47.460> my<00:00:48.089> background<00:00:48.900> is

00:00:49.640 --> 00:00:49.650 
engineering and so my my background is

00:00:49.650 --> 00:00:52.960 
engineering and so my my background is
basically<00:00:50.339> engineering<00:00:51.330> I<00:00:51.540> used<00:00:52.530> to<00:00:52.680> manage

00:00:52.960 --> 00:00:52.970 
basically engineering I used to manage

give<00:00:59.220> you<00:00:59.309> a<00:00:59.339> little<00:00:59.549> story<00:01:00.059> as<00:01:00.479> to<00:01:00.659> how<00:01:00.690> I<00:01:00.839> came

00:01:01.160 --> 00:01:01.170 
give you a little story as to how I came

00:01:01.170 --> 00:01:02.390 
give you a little story as to how I came
up<00:01:01.320> with<00:01:01.350> the<00:01:01.589> idea

00:01:02.390 --> 00:01:02.400 
up with the idea

00:01:02.400 --> 00:01:05.270 
up with the idea
I<00:01:02.930> bought<00:01:03.930> a<00:01:03.960> guitar<00:01:04.140> about<00:01:04.589> three<00:01:04.890> years<00:01:05.129> ago

00:01:05.270 --> 00:01:05.280 
I bought a guitar about three years ago

00:01:05.280 --> 00:01:10.340 
I bought a guitar about three years ago
and<00:01:06.890> tuned<00:01:07.890> it<00:01:08.070> up<00:01:08.159> played<00:01:09.000> one<00:01:09.270> tune<00:01:09.600> and<00:01:09.900> it

00:01:10.340 --> 00:01:10.350 
and tuned it up played one tune and it

00:01:10.350 --> 00:01:14.120 
and tuned it up played one tune and it
went<00:01:10.530> out<00:01:10.650> of<00:01:10.800> tune<00:01:11.010> right<00:01:11.430> away<00:01:12.020> so<00:01:13.020> I<00:01:13.440> just

00:01:14.120 --> 00:01:14.130 
went out of tune right away so I just

00:01:14.130 --> 00:01:17.270 
went out of tune right away so I just
happen<00:01:14.430> to<00:01:14.460> despise<00:01:14.970> playing<00:01:15.540> out<00:01:15.690> of<00:01:15.720> tune<00:01:16.280> so

00:01:17.270 --> 00:01:17.280 
happen to despise playing out of tune so

00:01:17.280 --> 00:01:20.270 
happen to despise playing out of tune so
anyways<00:01:17.820> I<00:01:18.000> looked<00:01:18.480> at<00:01:18.630> it<00:01:18.840> a<00:01:19.170> little<00:01:19.500> bit<00:01:19.650> and

00:01:20.270 --> 00:01:20.280 
anyways I looked at it a little bit and

00:01:20.280 --> 00:01:25.310 
anyways I looked at it a little bit and
I<00:01:20.760> guess<00:01:21.330> that<00:01:22.010> it<00:01:23.010> was<00:01:23.880> the<00:01:24.330> problem<00:01:25.110> with<00:01:25.290> a

00:01:25.310 --> 00:01:25.320 
I guess that it was the problem with a

00:01:25.320 --> 00:01:32.060 
I guess that it was the problem with a
nut<00:01:26.270> so<00:01:27.770> off<00:01:28.770> with<00:01:29.580> a<00:01:29.610> nut<00:01:29.850> and<00:01:30.680> then<00:01:31.680> I

00:01:32.060 --> 00:01:32.070 
nut so off with a nut and then I

00:01:32.070 --> 00:01:35.710 
nut so off with a nut and then I
replaced<00:01:32.880> it<00:01:33.090> with<00:01:33.150> a<00:01:33.300> carbon<00:01:33.870> graphite<00:01:34.080> nut

00:01:35.710 --> 00:01:35.720 
replaced it with a carbon graphite nut

00:01:35.720 --> 00:01:38.540 
replaced it with a carbon graphite nut
retune<00:01:36.720> the<00:01:36.750> guitar<00:01:37.230> with<00:01:37.530> electronic<00:01:38.100> tuner

00:01:38.540 --> 00:01:38.550 
retune the guitar with electronic tuner

00:01:38.550 --> 00:01:41.149 
retune the guitar with electronic tuner
and<00:01:39.210> played<00:01:39.900> one<00:01:40.140> song<00:01:40.440> and<00:01:40.740> it<00:01:40.800> went<00:01:40.980> out<00:01:41.100> of

00:01:41.149 --> 00:01:41.159 
and played one song and it went out of

00:01:41.159 --> 00:01:47.120 
and played one song and it went out of
tune<00:01:41.820> again<00:01:42.780> very<00:01:43.350> rapidly<00:01:43.970> so<00:01:44.970> I<00:01:45.330> I<00:01:46.170> made<00:01:46.920> it<00:01:47.040> a

00:01:47.120 --> 00:01:47.130 
tune again very rapidly so I I made it a

00:01:47.130 --> 00:01:49.730 
tune again very rapidly so I I made it a
quest<00:01:47.430> to<00:01:47.730> apply<00:01:48.090> my<00:01:48.360> engineering<00:01:49.229> background

00:01:49.730 --> 00:01:49.740 
quest to apply my engineering background

00:01:49.740 --> 00:01:53.840 
quest to apply my engineering background
to<00:01:50.330> researching<00:01:51.330> the<00:01:51.479> real<00:01:51.690> reason<00:01:52.500> why<00:01:52.890> this

00:01:53.840 --> 00:01:53.850 
to researching the real reason why this

00:01:53.850 --> 00:01:55.969 
to researching the real reason why this
guitar<00:01:54.330> was<00:01:54.540> constantly<00:01:55.140> going<00:01:55.380> out<00:01:55.680> of<00:01:55.800> tune

00:01:55.969 --> 00:01:55.979 
guitar was constantly going out of tune

00:01:55.979 --> 00:01:58.910 
guitar was constantly going out of tune
and<00:01:56.280> it<00:01:56.400> was<00:01:56.640> in<00:01:56.970> fact<00:01:57.000> at<00:01:57.540> the<00:01:58.110> nut<00:01:58.290> even<00:01:58.770> with

00:01:58.910 --> 00:01:58.920 
and it was in fact at the nut even with

00:01:58.920 --> 00:02:02.420 
and it was in fact at the nut even with
a<00:01:58.950> carbon<00:01:59.460> graphite<00:01:59.700> nut<00:02:00.620> so<00:02:01.620> we<00:02:01.830> came<00:02:02.040> up<00:02:02.100> with

00:02:02.420 --> 00:02:02.430 
a carbon graphite nut so we came up with

00:02:02.430 --> 00:02:05.780 
a carbon graphite nut so we came up with
two<00:02:02.729> methods<00:02:03.150> of<00:02:04.190> keeping<00:02:05.190> a<00:02:05.220> guitar<00:02:05.580> in<00:02:05.760> tune

00:02:05.780 --> 00:02:05.790 
two methods of keeping a guitar in tune

00:02:05.790 --> 00:02:09.139 
two methods of keeping a guitar in tune
while<00:02:06.330> you're<00:02:06.510> playing<00:02:07.640> one<00:02:08.640> we<00:02:08.849> call<00:02:09.119> a

00:02:09.139 --> 00:02:09.149 
while you're playing one we call a

00:02:09.149 --> 00:02:12.770 
while you're playing one we call a
string<00:02:09.629> release<00:02:09.959> and<00:02:11.030> the<00:02:12.030> other<00:02:12.180> one<00:02:12.420> is<00:02:12.720> a

00:02:12.770 --> 00:02:12.780 
string release and the other one is a

00:02:12.780 --> 00:02:15.199 
string release and the other one is a
string<00:02:13.409> lock<00:02:13.770> so<00:02:14.280> basically<00:02:14.760> only<00:02:15.000> two

00:02:15.199 --> 00:02:15.209 
string lock so basically only two

00:02:15.209 --> 00:02:16.180 
string lock so basically only two
methods

00:02:16.180 --> 00:02:16.190 
methods

00:02:16.190 --> 00:02:19.430 
methods
the<00:02:17.190> screen<00:02:17.430> release<00:02:17.850> allows<00:02:18.540> the<00:02:18.930> strings<00:02:19.230> to

00:02:19.430 --> 00:02:19.440 
the screen release allows the strings to

00:02:19.440 --> 00:02:22.310 
the screen release allows the strings to
move<00:02:19.650> very<00:02:19.680> freely<00:02:20.310> with<00:02:20.790> some<00:02:21.090> width<00:02:21.960> with

00:02:22.310 --> 00:02:22.320 
move very freely with some width with

00:02:22.320 --> 00:02:25.400 
move very freely with some width with
some<00:02:23.330> lubricant<00:02:24.330> in<00:02:24.570> between<00:02:24.990> the<00:02:25.140> strings

00:02:25.400 --> 00:02:25.410 
some lubricant in between the strings

00:02:25.410 --> 00:02:27.650 
some lubricant in between the strings
and<00:02:25.650> the<00:02:25.740> nut<00:02:25.920> and<00:02:26.190> this<00:02:26.610> mechanical<00:02:27.300> device

00:02:27.650 --> 00:02:27.660 
and the nut and this mechanical device

00:02:27.660 --> 00:02:30.500 
and the nut and this mechanical device
that<00:02:28.020> pushes<00:02:28.500> the<00:02:28.740> strings<00:02:29.130> to<00:02:29.970> where<00:02:30.180> they<00:02:30.360> go

00:02:30.500 --> 00:02:30.510 
that pushes the strings to where they go

00:02:30.510 --> 00:02:33.380 
that pushes the strings to where they go
through<00:02:30.930> the<00:02:31.170> nut<00:02:31.440> in<00:02:32.040> a<00:02:32.220> straight<00:02:32.640> line

00:02:33.380 --> 00:02:33.390 
through the nut in a straight line

00:02:33.390 --> 00:02:36.410 
through the nut in a straight line
so<00:02:33.780> this<00:02:34.110> eliminates<00:02:35.070> an<00:02:35.310> awful<00:02:35.760> lot<00:02:35.940> of<00:02:36.210> the

00:02:36.410 --> 00:02:36.420 
so this eliminates an awful lot of the

00:02:36.420 --> 00:02:38.180 
so this eliminates an awful lot of the
friction<00:02:36.690> that<00:02:36.960> occurs<00:02:37.440> at<00:02:37.680> the<00:02:37.800> nut<00:02:38.010> that

00:02:38.180 --> 00:02:38.190 
friction that occurs at the nut that

00:02:38.190 --> 00:02:40.550 
friction that occurs at the nut that
prevents<00:02:38.580> the<00:02:38.670> strings<00:02:39.000> from<00:02:39.690> returning<00:02:40.200> to

00:02:40.550 --> 00:02:40.560 
prevents the strings from returning to

00:02:40.560 --> 00:02:46.100 
prevents the strings from returning to
zero<00:02:41.960> it<00:02:42.960> works<00:02:43.290> fairly<00:02:43.590> well<00:02:44.420> and<00:02:45.420> and<00:02:45.960> it

00:02:46.100 --> 00:02:46.110 
zero it works fairly well and and it

00:02:46.110 --> 00:02:47.840 
zero it works fairly well and and it
doesn't<00:02:46.500> need<00:02:46.650> a<00:02:46.680> fine<00:02:46.980> tuner<00:02:47.430> on<00:02:47.550> the<00:02:47.700> back

00:02:47.840 --> 00:02:47.850 
doesn't need a fine tuner on the back

00:02:47.850 --> 00:02:49.850 
doesn't need a fine tuner on the back
you<00:02:48.030> can<00:02:48.150> put<00:02:48.210> this<00:02:48.750> device<00:02:49.200> the<00:02:49.500> string

00:02:49.850 --> 00:02:49.860 
you can put this device the string

00:02:49.860 --> 00:02:53.810 
you can put this device the string

when<00:03:46.800> I<00:03:46.830> first<00:03:47.160> thought<00:03:47.400> of<00:03:47.580> the<00:03:47.670> idea<00:03:48.180> I

00:03:48.229 --> 00:03:48.239 
when I first thought of the idea I

00:03:48.239 --> 00:03:49.850 
when I first thought of the idea I
thought<00:03:48.540> well<00:03:48.720> I<00:03:48.750> don't<00:03:49.050> want<00:03:49.290> to<00:03:49.380> make<00:03:49.680> any

00:03:49.850 --> 00:03:49.860 
thought well I don't want to make any

00:03:49.860 --> 00:03:51.560 
thought well I don't want to make any
alteration<00:03:50.489> to<00:03:50.519> the<00:03:50.610> guitar<00:03:51.030> and<00:03:51.239> I've<00:03:51.360> got<00:03:51.540> a

00:03:51.560 --> 00:03:51.570 
alteration to the guitar and I've got a

00:03:51.570 --> 00:03:55.640 
alteration to the guitar and I've got a
cure<00:03:52.500> this<00:03:52.709> problem<00:03:53.160> and<00:03:53.959> so<00:03:54.959> I<00:03:54.989> didn't<00:03:55.620> think

00:03:55.640 --> 00:03:55.650 
cure this problem and so I didn't think

00:03:55.650 --> 00:03:58.400 
cure this problem and so I didn't think
it<00:03:55.920> was<00:03:56.040> going<00:03:56.220> to<00:03:56.310> work<00:03:56.370> at<00:03:56.730> first<00:03:56.970> and<00:03:57.390> then<00:03:58.380> I

00:03:58.400 --> 00:03:58.410 
it was going to work at first and then I

00:03:58.410 --> 00:04:00.710 
it was going to work at first and then I
kind<00:03:58.739> of<00:03:58.830> vacillated<00:03:59.580> between<00:03:59.610> the<00:04:00.060> ideas<00:04:00.480> yes

00:04:00.710 --> 00:04:00.720 
kind of vacillated between the ideas yes

00:04:00.720 --> 00:04:02.360 
kind of vacillated between the ideas yes
it's<00:04:00.989> gonna<00:04:01.170> work<00:04:01.410> no<00:04:01.680> it's<00:04:01.890> not<00:04:02.040> gonna<00:04:02.280> work

00:04:02.360 --> 00:04:02.370 
it's gonna work no it's not gonna work

00:04:02.370 --> 00:04:04.430 
it's gonna work no it's not gonna work
and<00:04:02.910> back<00:04:03.390> and<00:04:03.570> forth<00:04:03.840> and<00:04:03.959> finally<00:04:04.050> I<00:04:04.320> said

00:04:04.430 --> 00:04:04.440 
and back and forth and finally I said

00:04:04.440 --> 00:04:06.440 
and back and forth and finally I said

00:04:08.240 --> 00:04:08.250 
living I make prototypes so I made one

00:04:08.250 --> 00:04:13.430 
living I make prototypes so I made one
and<00:04:08.900> put<00:04:09.900> it<00:04:10.019> on<00:04:10.170> my<00:04:10.410> new<00:04:11.010> guitar<00:04:11.400> and<00:04:12.290> lo<00:04:13.290> and

00:04:13.430 --> 00:04:13.440 
and put it on my new guitar and lo and

and put it on my new guitar and lo and
behold<00:04:13.560> it<00:04:14.190> worked<00:04:14.459> and<00:04:15.109> then<00:04:16.109> I<00:04:16.140> had<00:04:16.470> to<00:04:16.560> find

00:04:16.759 --> 00:04:16.769 
behold it worked and then I had to find

00:04:16.769 --> 00:04:18.650 
behold it worked and then I had to find
out<00:04:16.919> why<00:04:17.340> it<00:04:17.400> works<00:04:17.820> so<00:04:18.000> that's<00:04:18.239> what's

00:04:18.650 --> 00:04:18.660
