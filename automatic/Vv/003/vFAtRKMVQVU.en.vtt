can<00:05:49.770> I've<00:05:50.770> tried<00:05:51.010> the<00:05:51.160> installer<00:05:51.490> the<00:05:51.669> gang

00:05:51.840 --> 00:05:51.850 
can I've tried the installer the gang

00:05:51.850 --> 00:05:58.440 
can I've tried the installer the gang
but<00:05:52.210> I<00:05:52.450> said<00:05:52.990> I<00:05:53.200> had<00:05:53.620> to<00:05:54.060> verify<00:05:55.060> account<00:05:57.450> yeah

00:05:58.440 --> 00:05:58.450 
but I said I had to verify account yeah

00:05:58.450 --> 00:06:00.719 
but I said I had to verify account yeah
so<00:05:58.930> I<00:05:59.260> guess<00:05:59.620> something<00:06:00.220> i<00:06:00.310> could<00:06:00.370> do<00:06:00.580> is

00:06:00.719 --> 00:06:00.729 
so I guess something i could do is

00:06:00.729 --> 00:06:06.960 
so I guess something i could do is
delete<00:06:01.680> so<00:06:02.970> check<00:06:03.970> it<00:06:04.030> out<00:06:04.210> that's<00:06:05.789> this<00:06:06.789> could

00:06:06.960 --> 00:06:06.970 
delete so check it out that's this could

00:06:06.970 --> 00:06:09.810 
delete so check it out that's this could
be<00:06:07.090> an<00:06:07.180> additional<00:06:07.690> Angela<00:06:08.320> tunes<00:06:08.620> but<00:06:08.950> i'll

00:06:09.810 --> 00:06:09.820 
be an additional Angela tunes but i'll
