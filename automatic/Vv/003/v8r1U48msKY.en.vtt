Europe and Asia now I want to talk about
why<00:00:31.110> we<00:00:31.350> have<00:00:31.500> eclipses<00:00:32.040> and<00:00:32.309> from<00:00:32.699> a<00:00:32.789> last

00:00:32.990 --> 00:00:33.000 
why we have eclipses and from a last

00:00:33.000 --> 00:00:35.810 
why we have eclipses and from a last
astrological<00:00:33.719> point<00:00:34.559> of<00:00:34.710> view<00:00:34.949> these

00:00:35.810 --> 00:00:35.820 
astrological point of view these

00:00:35.820 --> 00:00:38.389 
astrological point of view these
eclipses<00:00:36.359> are<00:00:36.420> here<00:00:36.899> we<00:00:37.050> have<00:00:37.260> for<00:00:37.710> every<00:00:38.129> year

00:00:38.389 --> 00:00:38.399 
eclipses are here we have for every year

00:00:38.399 --> 00:00:42.169 
eclipses are here we have for every year
generally<00:00:38.969> last<00:00:39.329> year<00:00:39.570> we<00:00:39.719> had<00:00:39.749> six<00:00:40.999> they<00:00:41.999> are

00:00:42.169 --> 00:00:42.179 
generally last year we had six they are

00:00:42.179 --> 00:00:44.930 
generally last year we had six they are
here<00:00:42.510> to<00:00:42.570> propel<00:00:43.320> us<00:00:43.350> from<00:00:44.160> one<00:00:44.399> level<00:00:44.670> of

00:00:44.930 --> 00:00:44.940 
here to propel us from one level of

00:00:44.940 --> 00:00:48.110 
here to propel us from one level of
development<00:00:45.269> to<00:00:45.899> another<00:00:46.289> rather<00:00:47.010> quickly<00:00:47.489> we

00:00:48.110 --> 00:00:48.120 
development to another rather quickly we

00:00:48.120 --> 00:00:49.880 
development to another rather quickly we
all<00:00:48.300> tend<00:00:48.600> to<00:00:48.719> get<00:00:48.839> stuck<00:00:48.899> in<00:00:49.289> our<00:00:49.409> ruts<00:00:49.649> here

00:00:49.880 --> 00:00:49.890 
all tend to get stuck in our ruts here

00:00:49.890 --> 00:00:52.189 
all tend to get stuck in our ruts here
and<00:00:50.039> there<00:00:50.219> and<00:00:50.429> the<00:00:51.269> eclipses<00:00:51.659> will<00:00:51.899> move<00:00:52.079> us

00:00:52.189 --> 00:00:52.199 
and there and the eclipses will move us

00:00:52.199 --> 00:00:55.520 
and there and the eclipses will move us
up<00:00:52.379> and<00:00:52.589> out<00:00:53.179> this<00:00:54.179> can<00:00:54.809> be<00:00:54.839> discerning<00:00:55.379> for

00:00:55.520 --> 00:00:55.530 
up and out this can be discerning for

00:00:55.530 --> 00:00:57.559 
up and out this can be discerning for
some<00:00:55.710> people<00:00:56.069> especially<00:00:56.489> if<00:00:56.909> you've<00:00:57.300> not

00:00:57.559 --> 00:00:57.569 
some people especially if you've not

00:00:57.569 --> 00:01:00.380 
some people especially if you've not
been<00:00:57.780> willing<00:00:58.019> to<00:00:58.469> change<00:00:59.309> things<00:00:59.729> as<00:01:00.120> they

00:01:00.380 --> 00:01:00.390 
been willing to change things as they

00:01:00.390 --> 00:01:04.130 
been willing to change things as they
come<00:01:00.420> along<00:01:02.059> so<00:01:03.059> how<00:01:03.210> can<00:01:03.269> we<00:01:03.479> use<00:01:03.510> this<00:01:03.899> new

00:01:04.130 --> 00:01:04.140 
come along so how can we use this new

00:01:04.140 --> 00:01:06.380 
come along so how can we use this new
moon<00:01:04.320> eclipses<00:01:04.680> energy<00:01:05.130> for<00:01:05.460> our<00:01:05.489> highest<00:01:06.120> and

00:01:06.380 --> 00:01:06.390 
moon eclipses energy for our highest and

00:01:06.390 --> 00:01:10.490 
moon eclipses energy for our highest and
our<00:01:06.630> best<00:01:08.270> with<00:01:09.270> the<00:01:09.480> eclipse<00:01:09.900> in<00:01:10.140> the<00:01:10.290> sign<00:01:10.470> of
