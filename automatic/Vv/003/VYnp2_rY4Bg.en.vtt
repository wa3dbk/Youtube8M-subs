00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.020
 The closing of boxes can eg 

00:00:02.220 --> 00:00:05.700
 the multiplayer mode of minecraft very much 

00:00:04.020 --> 00:00:07.620
 very handy with the version 

00:00:05.700 --> 00:00:10.320
 1.8 or the already published the 

00:00:07.620 --> 00:00:11.940
 snapshot 14.03 is easy 

00:00:10.320 --> 00:00:13.980
 possible crates with a password too 

00:00:11.940 --> 00:00:17.540
 secure and how that works we show 

00:00:13.980 --> 00:00:17.540
 you in this minecraft tutorial 

00:00:25.460 --> 00:00:30.450
 Hello dear my lover and warmly 

00:00:27.900 --> 00:00:32.040
 Welcome to the other tutorial of 107 

00:00:30.450 --> 00:00:33.330
 we want to announce now as already announced 

00:00:32.040 --> 00:00:34.890
 close this box 

00:00:33.330 --> 00:00:36.780
 and we'll just do it 

00:00:34.890 --> 00:00:39.059
 a command blog show on the rhine I 've got 

00:00:36.780 --> 00:00:42.090
 the whole preparation is namely the 

00:00:39.059 --> 00:00:43.739
 newly added command / blog data and 

00:00:42.090 --> 00:00:46.050
 behind them come the coordinates and that 

00:00:43.739 --> 00:00:47.489
 the coordinates where to find the box 

00:00:46.050 --> 00:00:49.020
 that means we just go to 

00:00:47.489 --> 00:00:52.590
 crate and see which coordinates de 

00:00:49.020 --> 00:00:54.449
 to register in case 1 3571 in 2 22 

00:00:52.590 --> 00:00:56.370
 and now we do a sweeping 

00:00:54.449 --> 00:00:58.739
 clip and write behind locke 

00:00:56.370 --> 00:00:59.909
 colon quotes above and 

00:00:58.739 --> 00:01:01.199
 Now we can get a password 

00:00:59.909 --> 00:01:03.390
 in the case we simply think of 

00:01:01.199 --> 00:01:06.659
 quite uncreative a big p and a 

00:01:03.390 --> 00:01:08.190
 big w for password pw and then again 

00:01:06.659 --> 00:01:09.810
 quotes above and the 

00:01:08.190 --> 00:01:11.100
 curved bracket to the command 

00:01:09.810 --> 00:01:11.670
 Of course you can also find the video 

00:01:11.100 --> 00:01:13.530
 description 

00:01:11.670 --> 00:01:15.600
 Now we look at don and feel 

00:01:13.530 --> 00:01:17.670
 once the eco warns with the button 

00:01:15.600 --> 00:01:19.650
 who lives here at the command blog and if 

00:01:17.670 --> 00:01:21.030
 we now legally to the crate 

00:01:19.650 --> 00:01:23.640
 we still can not open it 

00:01:21.030 --> 00:01:25.290
 Still comes iñárritu it lures 

00:01:23.640 --> 00:01:26.430
 and this message we can only 

00:01:25.290 --> 00:01:27.720
 deal with the right one 

00:01:26.430 --> 00:01:29.220
 use key for one 

00:01:27.720 --> 00:01:31.290
 password input works of course 

00:01:29.220 --> 00:01:32.700
 not and that's why we go to the anvil 

00:01:31.290 --> 00:01:36.030
 and just take it in this case 

00:01:32.700 --> 00:01:37.820
 an ax and call those around in pw us 

00:01:36.030 --> 00:01:39.810
 Of course you can do that too 

00:01:37.820 --> 00:01:41.670
 It does not necessarily have to be a company 

00:01:39.810 --> 00:01:43.260
 be a doctor but I'll just do it 

00:01:41.670 --> 00:01:44.790
 the example of an ax and if we the 

00:01:43.260 --> 00:01:46.620
 have ax in hand and then right 

00:01:44.790 --> 00:01:48.210
 then we can do it on the box 

00:01:46.620 --> 00:01:49.590
 just open and we see in it 

00:01:48.210 --> 00:01:51.720
 there is a command blog and a 

00:01:49.590 --> 00:01:53.340
 crate and we bypass the so to speak 

00:01:51.720 --> 00:01:55.260
 password protection the whole thing works 

00:01:53.340 --> 00:01:55.800
 then only with items which really pw 

00:01:55.260 --> 00:01:57.570
 be called 

00:01:55.800 --> 00:01:59.220
 Do you take the hand then work again 

00:01:57.570 --> 00:02:01.440
 not on and that was it already from 

00:01:59.220 --> 00:02:02.640

00:02:01.440 --> 00:02:04.350
