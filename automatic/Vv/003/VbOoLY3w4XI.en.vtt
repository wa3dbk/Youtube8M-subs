a<00:01:52.690> hangover<00:01:52.990> I'm<00:01:53.229> right<00:01:53.380> saying<00:01:53.590> I<00:01:53.770> don't<00:01:53.860> know

00:01:54.059 --> 00:01:54.069 
a hangover I'm right saying I don't know

00:01:54.069 --> 00:01:56.429 
a hangover I'm right saying I don't know
actually<00:01:54.490> I<00:01:55.090> think<00:01:55.119> that<00:01:55.479> we<00:01:55.810> kept<00:01:56.049> we<00:01:56.140> adhered

00:01:56.429 --> 00:01:56.439 
actually I think that we kept we adhered

00:01:56.439 --> 00:01:58.709 
actually I think that we kept we adhered
to<00:01:56.530> the<00:01:56.619> formula<00:01:57.039> and<00:01:57.130> the<00:01:57.189> second<00:01:57.520> one<00:01:57.719> for

00:01:58.709 --> 00:01:58.719 
to the formula and the second one for

00:01:58.719 --> 00:02:00.420 
to the formula and the second one for
those<00:01:58.869> you've<00:01:59.020> seen<00:01:59.259> it<00:01:59.380> and<00:01:59.530> and<00:02:00.100> the<00:02:00.250> third

00:02:00.420 --> 00:02:00.430 
those you've seen it and and the third

00:02:00.430 --> 00:02:01.889 
those you've seen it and and the third
one<00:02:00.670> I<00:02:00.700> think<00:02:00.969> which<00:02:01.119> would<00:02:01.270> close<00:02:01.509> the<00:02:01.719> hole

00:02:01.889 --> 00:02:01.899 
one I think which would close the hole

00:02:01.899 --> 00:02:03.959 
one I think which would close the hole
the<00:02:02.259> whole<00:02:02.439> sort<00:02:02.710> of<00:02:02.740> trilogy<00:02:03.189> but<00:02:03.399> now<00:02:03.759> it

00:02:03.959 --> 00:02:03.969 
the whole sort of trilogy but now it

00:02:03.969 --> 00:02:05.399 
the whole sort of trilogy but now it
would<00:02:04.119> be<00:02:04.240> a<00:02:04.270> trilogy<00:02:04.570> even<00:02:05.259> though<00:02:05.320> we

00:02:05.399 --> 00:02:05.409 
would be a trilogy even though we

00:02:05.409 --> 00:02:06.480 
would be a trilogy even though we
thought<00:02:05.590> we<00:02:05.680> would<00:02:05.740> never<00:02:05.859> make<00:02:06.070> a<00:02:06.130> second<00:02:06.460> one

00:02:06.480 --> 00:02:06.490 
thought we would never make a second one

00:02:06.490 --> 00:02:08.370 
thought we would never make a second one
let<00:02:06.789> alone<00:02:06.820> anybody<00:02:07.149> see<00:02:07.420> the<00:02:07.509> first<00:02:07.719> one<00:02:07.929> I

00:02:08.370 --> 00:02:08.380 
let alone anybody see the first one I

00:02:08.380 --> 00:02:10.109 
let alone anybody see the first one I
think<00:02:08.709> it'll<00:02:09.009> take<00:02:09.190> place<00:02:09.399> in<00:02:09.579> Los<00:02:09.850> Angeles

00:02:10.109 --> 00:02:10.119 
think it'll take place in Los Angeles

00:02:10.119 --> 00:02:12.030 
think it'll take place in Los Angeles
