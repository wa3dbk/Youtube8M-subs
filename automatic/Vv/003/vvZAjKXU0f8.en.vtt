00:00:53.119 --> 00:00:53.129 
say site activity then moving down you

00:00:53.129 --> 00:00:54.860 
say site activity then moving down you
then<00:00:53.160> got<00:00:53.460> angler<00:00:53.760> ball<00:00:53.910> head<00:00:54.120> 9<00:00:54.510> different

00:00:54.860 --> 00:00:54.870 
then got angler ball head 9 different

00:00:54.870 --> 00:00:56.689 
then got angler ball head 9 different
positions<00:00:55.230> they're<00:00:55.469> giving<00:00:56.190> you<00:00:56.280> a<00:00:56.309> range<00:00:56.550> of

00:00:56.689 --> 00:00:56.699 
positions they're giving you a range of
