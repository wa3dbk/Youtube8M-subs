00:01:11.219 --> 00:01:11.229 
tail that I'm going to weave in and I

00:01:11.229 --> 00:01:13.889 
tail that I'm going to weave in and I
take<00:01:11.440> my<00:01:11.680> yarn<00:01:11.920> and<00:01:12.729> just<00:01:13.299> pull<00:01:13.509> it<00:01:13.630> through

00:01:13.889 --> 00:01:13.899
