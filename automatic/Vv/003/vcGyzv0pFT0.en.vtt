00:02:44.290 --> 00:02:44.300 
the worm technique if not the whole work

00:02:44.300 --> 00:02:45.190 
the worm technique if not the whole work
thing<00:02:44.330> if<00:02:44.660> you<00:02:44.720> don't<00:02:44.870> know<00:02:44.930> the<00:02:45.050> worm

thing if you don't know the worm

00:02:45.200 --> 00:02:46.810 
thing if you don't know the worm
technique<00:02:45.590> that's<00:02:46.070> basically<00:02:46.370> you<00:02:46.520> come<00:02:46.700> in
