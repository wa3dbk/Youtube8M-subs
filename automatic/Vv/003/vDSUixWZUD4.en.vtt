00:00:37.650 --> 00:00:37.660 
lights strung around this pine tree in

00:00:37.660 --> 00:00:38.819 
lights strung around this pine tree in
the<00:00:37.810> middle<00:00:37.989> of<00:00:38.110> the<00:00:38.170> living<00:00:38.350> room<00:00:38.440> every<00:00:38.710> day

the middle of the living room every day

00:00:38.829 --> 00:00:41.280 
the middle of the living room every day
and<00:00:39.610> I<00:00:39.700> just<00:00:40.090> think<00:00:40.360> that<00:00:40.510> a<00:00:40.570> Christmas<00:00:40.989> tree

00:00:41.280 --> 00:00:41.290 
and I just think that a Christmas tree

00:00:41.290 --> 00:00:45.900 
and I just think that a Christmas tree
is<00:00:42.100> even<00:00:43.000> though<00:00:43.150> it's<00:00:43.300> not<00:00:43.480> a<00:00:43.710> religious<00:00:44.710> icon

00:00:45.900 --> 00:00:45.910 
is even though it's not a religious icon

00:00:45.910 --> 00:00:48.000 
is even though it's not a religious icon
it<00:00:46.450> speaks<00:00:46.750> of<00:00:46.899> religion<00:00:47.320> so<00:00:47.470> I<00:00:47.500> would<00:00:47.800> not

00:00:48.000 --> 00:00:48.010 
it speaks of religion so I would not

00:00:48.010 --> 00:00:50.580 
it speaks of religion so I would not
have<00:00:48.070> a<00:00:48.310> Christmas<00:00:48.760> tree<00:00:49.030> hmm<00:00:49.989> I<00:00:50.200> mean<00:00:50.470> you
