00:01:28.249 --> 00:01:28.259 
goblins all fully upgraded I would

00:01:28.259 --> 00:01:31.069 
goblins all fully upgraded I would
assume<00:01:28.819> actually<00:01:29.819> I<00:01:29.850> did<00:01:30.420> lose<00:01:30.569> a<00:01:30.630> couple<00:01:30.810> here

00:01:31.069 --> 00:01:31.079

from<00:01:31.259> the<00:01:31.350> attack<00:01:31.590> by<00:01:31.829> Zorro<00:01:32.130> so<00:01:33.030> maybe<00:01:33.270> not

00:01:33.410 --> 00:01:33.420 
from the attack by Zorro so maybe not

00:01:33.420 --> 00:01:35.240 
from the attack by Zorro so maybe not
making<00:01:33.719> quite<00:01:33.990> as<00:01:34.140> much<00:01:34.289> money<00:01:34.530> as<00:01:34.619> I<00:01:34.770> as<00:01:35.130> I

00:01:35.240 --> 00:01:35.250 
making quite as much money as I as I

00:01:35.250 --> 00:01:38.120 
making quite as much money as I as I
first<00:01:35.520> thought<00:01:36.619> so<00:01:37.619> we're<00:01:37.709> rebuilding

00:01:38.120 --> 00:01:38.130 
first thought so we're rebuilding

00:01:38.130 --> 00:01:40.370 
first thought so we're rebuilding
Thunder<00:01:38.520> map<00:01:38.729> and<00:01:38.969> a<00:01:39.600> sock<00:01:39.899> here<00:01:40.110> might<00:01:40.259> go

00:01:40.370 --> 00:01:40.380 
Thunder map and a sock here might go

00:01:40.380 --> 00:01:42.109 
Thunder map and a sock here might go
down<00:01:40.560> from<00:01:40.770> these<00:01:40.920> archers<00:01:41.310> yes<00:01:41.520> he<00:01:41.640> does<00:01:41.819> so

00:01:42.109 --> 00:01:42.119 
down from these archers yes he does so

00:01:42.119 --> 00:01:43.809 
down from these archers yes he does so
these<00:01:42.240> are<00:01:42.450> so<00:01:42.840> a<00:01:42.869> sock<00:01:43.170> does<00:01:43.350> fall

00:01:43.809 --> 00:01:43.819 
these are so a sock does fall

00:01:43.819 --> 00:01:46.039 
these are so a sock does fall
