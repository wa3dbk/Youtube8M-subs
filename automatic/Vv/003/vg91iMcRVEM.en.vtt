00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:07.580
 know the best definition for this 

00:00:02.909 --> 00:00:07.580
 range rover evoque dream of consumption 

00:00:07.849 --> 00:00:12.809
 not so much exaggeration 

00:00:10.080 --> 00:00:14.759
 who saw the car worshiped even those who 

00:00:12.809 --> 00:00:17.250
 twist your nose to soul crossover 

00:00:14.759 --> 00:00:19.109
 SUVs but I was not 

00:00:17.250 --> 00:00:21.750
 thinking it's just because of the lines 

00:00:19.109 --> 00:00:25.380
 practically identical case of the 

00:00:21.750 --> 00:00:30.330
 concept lrx presented in 2008 in the 

00:00:25.380 --> 00:00:32.369
 hall of detroit has more stands 

00:00:30.330 --> 00:00:34.230
 the content of the details that give a 

00:00:32.369 --> 00:00:36.500
 charm that does not go unnoticed by 

00:00:34.230 --> 00:00:39.510
 nobody without forgetting the finish 

00:00:36.500 --> 00:00:41.850
 typical of British luxury cars with 

00:00:39.510 --> 00:00:44.430
 quality materials and well 

00:00:41.850 --> 00:00:46.289
 made until the sports proposal of the 

00:00:44.430 --> 00:00:48.600
 inside a shell-type seats 

00:00:46.289 --> 00:00:51.420
 imitation of competition is as far as 

00:00:48.600 --> 00:00:54.360
 correct but let's go to the great details 

00:00:51.420 --> 00:00:56.910
 to start the selection knob 

00:00:54.360 --> 00:01:00.180
 the automatic transmission of speed only gives 

00:00:56.910 --> 00:01:02.670
 When you turn on the television 

00:01:00.180 --> 00:01:04.769
 baby with the car walking only appears to 

00:01:02.670 --> 00:01:06.600
 who goes next door who can hear 

00:01:04.769 --> 00:01:09.930
 headphones while the driver enjoys a 

00:01:06.600 --> 00:01:12.420
 music another attraction selecting mode 

00:01:09.930 --> 00:01:14.280
 dynamics of driving the indicators in the 

00:01:12.420 --> 00:01:17.340
 dashboard goes from light 

00:01:14.280 --> 00:01:21.420
 white to red want to see cap 

00:01:17.340 --> 00:01:22.259
 back five cameras show everything in 360 

00:01:21.420 --> 00:01:24.270
 degrees 

00:01:22.259 --> 00:01:26.189
 has its name illuminated on the threshold of 

00:01:24.270 --> 00:01:29.490
 doors and light emitted by rear-view mirrors 

00:01:26.189 --> 00:01:32.310
 to see where you step on the night 

00:01:29.490 --> 00:01:35.030
 lights futuristic design project 

00:01:32.310 --> 00:01:37.350
 I do not know. 

00:01:35.030 --> 00:01:39.810
 but I did not think everything is a 

00:01:37.350 --> 00:01:43.170
 wonder the visibility mainly 

00:01:39.810 --> 00:01:44.549
 back is bad if you think about taking 

00:01:43.170 --> 00:01:47.490
 the family to travel 

00:01:44.549 --> 00:01:49.320
 forget despite the three seats in the bank 

00:01:47.490 --> 00:01:52.770
 only two adults and one 

00:01:49.320 --> 00:01:55.740
 the children to tighten them and the trunk with 

00:01:52.770 --> 00:01:57.990
 420 liters is not one of the largest 

00:01:55.740 --> 00:01:59.880
 in compensation it gives much pleasure to the 

00:01:57.990 --> 00:02:02.859
 to drive 

00:01:59.880 --> 00:02:05.520
 begins with the 2.0 turbo engine that delivers 

00:02:02.859 --> 00:02:07.990
 power and torque progressively 

00:02:05.520 --> 00:02:09.009
 favoring accelerations and resumption of 

00:02:07.990 --> 00:02:10.840
 velocity 

00:02:09.009 --> 00:02:12.940
 everything is orchestrated by an exchange 

00:02:10.840 --> 00:02:15.519
 six-speed automatic that have 

00:02:12.940 --> 00:02:17.980
 sports position and allows for 

00:02:15.519 --> 00:02:20.290
 in the letters behind the wheel 

00:02:17.980 --> 00:02:22.750
 but the average consumption of 5 kilometers 

00:02:20.290 --> 00:02:26.340
 and a half a liter of gasoline in our 

00:02:22.750 --> 00:02:29.440
 test circuit should be better 

00:02:26.340 --> 00:02:30.790
 the traction is integral and has five modes 

00:02:29.440 --> 00:02:33.700
 many different 

00:02:30.790 --> 00:02:35.980
 the normal to walk in the city or road 

00:02:33.700 --> 00:02:36.819
 the dynamic to care even performance 

00:02:35.980 --> 00:02:39.310
 no asphalt 

00:02:36.819 --> 00:02:41.680
 the suspension becomes more rigid and 

00:02:39.310 --> 00:02:44.049
 impair comfort but increase the 

00:02:41.680 --> 00:02:46.269
 stability 

00:02:44.049 --> 00:02:47.170
 the other three modules are out 

00:02:46.269 --> 00:02:49.569
 of road 

00:02:47.170 --> 00:02:54.280
 I mean if you have the courage to 

00:02:49.569 --> 00:02:55.000
 put it on the ground if you stay 

00:02:54.280 --> 00:02:57.790
 quiet 

00:02:55.000 --> 00:03:00.879
 the cameras the good angles of entry and 

00:02:57.790 --> 00:03:04.420
 ground clearance and options for 

00:03:00.879 --> 00:03:07.060
 gravel or snow and mud and juices and a 

00:03:04.420 --> 00:03:09.459
 to walk on the sand do with 

00:03:07.060 --> 00:03:12.310
 that it maintains the tradition neither of the government 

00:03:09.459 --> 00:03:15.819
 a mouth adapts the settings each 

00:03:12.310 --> 00:03:18.459
 suspension and engine torque 

00:03:15.819 --> 00:03:20.260
 according to the situation without talking to the soup 

00:03:18.459 --> 00:03:22.959
 of letters that goes from controls 

00:03:20.260 --> 00:03:25.720
 electronic stability and traction 

00:03:22.959 --> 00:03:28.000
 to the tissue assistant who maintains 

00:03:25.720 --> 00:03:30.000
 speed programmed automatically at 

00:03:28.000 --> 00:03:33.880
 any floor 

00:03:30.000 --> 00:03:36.489
 It's hard not to like him, right? 

00:03:33.880 --> 00:03:38.980
 to stop being a consumer dream 

00:03:36.489 --> 00:03:41.829
 after all to have one equal to this one 

00:03:38.980 --> 00:03:43.720
 technology stew hissing 

00:03:41.829 --> 00:03:47.440
 You'll have to shell out a good 

00:03:43.720 --> 00:03:50.250
 money but it's a charm it 's not even 

00:03:47.440 --> 00:03:54.400
 let's go to performance 8 corn notes

 the most expensive
