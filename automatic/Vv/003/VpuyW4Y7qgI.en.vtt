00:00:23.440 --> 00:00:30.939
 part of the fairing and lift the tank 

00:00:28.600 --> 00:00:31.990
 I'll do it here to show you 

00:00:30.939 --> 00:00:35.400
 How is it? 

00:00:31.990 --> 00:00:35.400

00:00:54.760 --> 00:01:07.060
 part of the fairing here 

00:00:56.500 --> 00:01:15.840
 the other two screws here and here 

00:01:07.060 --> 00:01:18.250
 People take this piece of the fairing here. 

00:01:15.840 --> 00:01:20.140
 you have to take because it is 

00:01:18.250 --> 00:01:21.700
 caught in the tank what will be 

00:01:20.140 --> 00:01:24.310
 lifted up later 

00:01:21.700 --> 00:01:27.010
 now I'm going to take the other side then 

00:01:24.310 --> 00:01:28.900
 boyfriend after you took the karina 

00:01:27.010 --> 00:01:31.660
 part of the side fairing here and the 

00:01:28.900 --> 00:01:35.520
 this side here right in front of the tank 

00:01:31.660 --> 00:01:35.520
 behind the table has two Allen screws 

00:01:35.680 --> 00:01:38.670
 let's remove them 

00:01:40.980 --> 00:01:45.790
 ready now it's loose now we 're going 

00:01:43.270 --> 00:01:53.680
 lift the tank to gain access to 

00:01:45.790 --> 00:01:55.210
 battery power is here 

00:01:53.680 --> 00:01:58.210
 Now we're going to drop the two of you. 

00:01:55.210 --> 00:02:01.180
 positive and negative terminals 

00:01:58.210 --> 00:02:03.490
 We always have to let go of the negative. 

00:02:01.180 --> 00:02:05.470
 first if you have a hand 

00:02:03.490 --> 00:02:08.229
 in the key to touch some part of the 

00:02:05.470 --> 00:02:09.940
 bike do not make short so I'll let go 

00:02:08.229 --> 00:02:12.070
 Water 

00:02:09.940 --> 00:02:15.090
 so let's always just go by the cable 

00:02:12.070 --> 00:02:15.090
 negative first 

00:02:17.500 --> 00:02:21.340
 be careful here so you do not leave 

00:02:19.330 --> 00:02:24.190
 the bolt drops 

00:02:21.340 --> 00:02:26.770
 If it falls inside you will have to 

00:02:24.190 --> 00:02:29.940
 find another can not find 

00:02:26.770 --> 00:02:29.940

00:02:34.120 --> 00:02:38.030

00:02:36.349 --> 00:02:40.879

00:02:59.640 --> 00:03:08.750
