times we have the same song we were

00:02:03.990 --> 00:02:06.310 
times we have the same song we were
playing<00:02:04.260> bought<00:02:04.980> off<00:02:05.130> YouTube<00:02:05.550> good<00:02:05.760> quality

00:02:06.310 --> 00:02:06.320

00:02:08.570 --> 00:02:08.580 
we try to put the cable for both

00:02:08.580 --> 00:02:11.660 
we try to put the cable for both
speakers<00:02:08.910> at<00:02:09.390> the<00:02:09.479> same<00:02:09.660> time<00:02:09.929> and<00:02:10.520> right<00:02:11.520> now

00:02:11.660 --> 00:02:11.670 
speakers at the same time and right now

00:02:11.670 --> 00:02:13.660 
speakers at the same time and right now
we<00:02:11.730> connected<00:02:12.300> blue<00:02:12.480> tuned<00:02:12.750> via<00:02:12.930> bluetooth

00:02:13.660 --> 00:02:13.670 
we connected blue tuned via bluetooth

00:02:13.670 --> 00:02:16.640 
we connected blue tuned via bluetooth
but<00:02:14.900> anyway<00:02:15.900> I<00:02:15.960> would<00:02:16.140> like<00:02:16.170> to<00:02:16.410> just<00:02:16.560> point

00:02:16.640 --> 00:02:16.650 
but anyway I would like to just point

00:02:16.650 --> 00:02:18.890 
but anyway I would like to just point
out<00:02:16.980> this<00:02:17.490> is<00:02:17.550> not<00:02:17.730> the<00:02:17.910> best<00:02:18.150> comparison<00:02:18.540> but

00:02:18.890 --> 00:02:18.900 
out this is not the best comparison but

00:02:18.900 --> 00:02:21.260 
out this is not the best comparison but
it's<00:02:18.959> just<00:02:19.200> we<00:02:19.890> wanted<00:02:20.190> to<00:02:20.280> see<00:02:20.520> the<00:02:20.760> quality

00:02:21.260 --> 00:02:21.270 
it's just we wanted to see the quality

00:02:21.270 --> 00:02:24.290 
it's just we wanted to see the quality
if<00:02:22.260> you're<00:02:22.410> not<00:02:22.500> familiar<00:02:22.620> with<00:02:22.950> QSC<00:02:23.610> this<00:02:24.120> is

00:02:24.290 --> 00:02:24.300 
if you're not familiar with QSC this is

00:02:24.300 --> 00:02:26.510 
if you're not familiar with QSC this is
a<00:02:24.390> thousand<00:02:25.110> watts<00:02:25.260> peak<00:02:25.560> power<00:02:25.800> 12-inch

00:02:26.510 --> 00:02:26.520 
a thousand watts peak power 12-inch

00:02:26.520 --> 00:02:29.720 
a thousand watts peak power 12-inch
speaker<00:02:27.060> with<00:02:27.510> a<00:02:27.570> horn<00:02:27.980> and<00:02:28.980> it's<00:02:29.370> the<00:02:29.520> case

00:02:29.720 --> 00:02:29.730 
speaker with a horn and it's the case

00:02:29.730 --> 00:02:32.090 
speaker with a horn and it's the case
series<00:02:30.150> by<00:02:30.330> QSC<00:02:31.110> so<00:02:31.380> it's<00:02:31.560> a<00:02:31.620> very<00:02:31.830> expensive

00:02:32.090 --> 00:02:32.100 
series by QSC so it's a very expensive

00:02:32.100 --> 00:02:34.729 
series by QSC so it's a very expensive
speaker<00:02:32.790> it's<00:02:33.300> running<00:02:33.720> on<00:02:33.810> those<00:02:34.050> close<00:02:34.590> to

00:02:34.729 --> 00:02:34.739 
speaker it's running on those close to

00:02:34.739 --> 00:02:36.890 
speaker it's running on those close to
$1000<00:02:35.459> and<00:02:35.700> here<00:02:35.940> we<00:02:36.090> are<00:02:36.180> comparing<00:02:36.570> it<00:02:36.750> to<00:02:36.780> a

00:02:36.890 --> 00:02:36.900 
$1000 and here we are comparing it to a

00:02:36.900 --> 00:02:38.660 
$1000 and here we are comparing it to a
three<00:02:37.230> hundred<00:02:37.350> and<00:02:37.620> fifty<00:02:37.890> dollars<00:02:38.190> speaker

00:02:38.660 --> 00:02:38.670 
three hundred and fifty dollars speaker

00:02:38.670 --> 00:02:41.090 
three hundred and fifty dollars speaker

00:03:11.710 --> 00:03:26.280 

all<00:03:12.710> right<00:03:12.830> we're<00:03:12.980> gonna<00:03:13.070> crank<00:03:13.310> it<00:03:13.430> up<00:03:13.520> now

00:03:26.280 --> 00:03:26.290 

00:03:26.290 --> 00:03:36.310 

all<00:03:32.860> right<00:03:33.860> so<00:03:33.920> that's<00:03:34.280> the<00:03:34.490> QSC<00:03:35.320> super

00:03:36.310 --> 00:03:36.320 
all right so that's the QSC super

00:03:36.320 --> 00:03:39.850 
all right so that's the QSC super
blasted<00:03:37.240> with<00:03:38.240> regulators<00:03:38.810> on<00:03:39.140> the<00:03:39.260> amps<00:03:39.620> so

00:03:39.850 --> 00:03:39.860 
blasted with regulators on the amps so

00:03:39.860 --> 00:03:41.830 
blasted with regulators on the amps so
that<00:03:40.010> that<00:03:40.220> way<00:03:40.370> it<00:03:40.490> doesn't<00:03:40.670> get<00:03:40.910> you<00:03:41.450> know<00:03:41.480> so

00:03:41.830 --> 00:03:41.840 
that that way it doesn't get you know so

00:03:41.840 --> 00:03:44.200 
that that way it doesn't get you know so
it<00:03:41.900> doesn't<00:03:41.930> blow<00:03:42.490> etc<00:03:43.490> all<00:03:43.640> that<00:03:43.670> comes<00:03:44.090> out

00:03:47.610 --> 00:03:47.620 
all that detail but that's the QSC k12

00:03:47.620 --> 00:03:53.050 
all that detail but that's the QSC k12
super<00:03:48.620> clean<00:03:48.860> sound<00:03:49.510> this<00:03:50.510> is<00:03:50.950> the<00:03:51.950> M<00:03:52.130> 4,000

00:04:18.449 --> 00:04:25.710 

she<00:04:19.470> doubles<00:04:23.009> so<00:04:24.009> as<00:04:24.610> we<00:04:24.759> can<00:04:24.880> see<00:04:25.090> it<00:04:25.240> is<00:04:25.360> super

00:04:25.710 --> 00:04:25.720 
she doubles so as we can see it is super

00:04:25.720 --> 00:04:30.210 
she doubles so as we can see it is super
loud<00:04:26.669> it's<00:04:27.669> a<00:04:27.820> screaming<00:04:28.240> loud<00:04:28.860> which<00:04:29.860> might

00:04:31.860 --> 00:04:31.870 
not be a good thing

00:04:31.870 --> 00:04:34.560 
not be a good thing
just<00:04:32.620> from<00:04:32.800> comparison<00:04:33.490> we<00:04:33.970> did<00:04:34.150> some<00:04:34.330> pros

the pros for this speaker here before I

00:04:44.380 --> 00:04:47.730 
the pros for this speaker here before I

00:04:49.560 --> 00:04:49.570 
the price you get a really good speaker

00:04:49.570 --> 00:04:52.920 
the price you get a really good speaker
but<00:04:49.900> the<00:04:50.440> pros<00:04:50.680> here<00:04:50.889> are<00:04:51.070> it<00:04:51.400> is<00:04:52.240> super<00:04:52.780> loud

00:04:52.920 --> 00:04:52.930 
but the pros here are it is super loud

00:04:52.930 --> 00:04:56.460 
but the pros here are it is super loud
like<00:04:53.560> extremely<00:04:54.250> loud<00:04:54.930> but<00:04:55.930> you<00:04:56.110> also<00:04:56.229> have

00:04:56.460 --> 00:04:56.470 
like extremely loud but you also have

00:04:56.470 --> 00:04:58.350 
like extremely loud but you also have
two<00:04:56.680> speakers<00:04:57.099> in<00:04:57.160> one<00:04:57.460> horn<00:04:57.729> we're<00:04:58.060> comparing

00:04:58.350 --> 00:04:58.360 
two speakers in one horn we're comparing

00:04:58.360 --> 00:05:00.330 
two speakers in one horn we're comparing
this<00:04:58.599> to<00:04:58.660> a<00:04:58.780> 12-inch<00:04:59.320> speaker<00:04:59.680> with<00:04:59.889> one<00:05:00.070> horn

00:05:00.330 --> 00:05:00.340 
this to a 12-inch speaker with one horn

00:05:00.340 --> 00:05:03.749 
this to a 12-inch speaker with one horn
I<00:05:00.570> would<00:05:01.570> say<00:05:01.780> it's<00:05:01.930> about<00:05:02.020> twice<00:05:02.410> as<00:05:02.650> loud<00:05:02.889> but

00:05:03.749 --> 00:05:03.759 
I would say it's about twice as loud but

00:05:03.759 --> 00:05:05.219 
I would say it's about twice as loud but
it's<00:05:03.910> just<00:05:04.000> screaming<00:05:04.270> loud<00:05:04.660> so<00:05:04.930> it<00:05:04.960> can't

00:05:05.219 --> 00:05:05.229 
it's just screaming loud so it can't

00:05:05.229 --> 00:05:07.560 
it's just screaming loud so it can't
necessarily<00:05:05.380> be<00:05:05.860> a<00:05:05.889> good<00:05:06.160> thing<00:05:06.400> but<00:05:07.300> that<00:05:07.449> is

00:05:07.560 --> 00:05:07.570 
necessarily be a good thing but that is

00:05:07.570 --> 00:05:10.680 
necessarily be a good thing but that is
a<00:05:07.599> pro<00:05:07.900> for<00:05:08.139> sure<00:05:08.169> it<00:05:08.349> is<00:05:08.470> super<00:05:08.830> loud<00:05:09.690> the

00:05:10.680 --> 00:05:10.690 
a pro for sure it is super loud the

00:05:10.690 --> 00:05:12.719 
a pro for sure it is super loud the
other<00:05:10.840> pro<00:05:11.169> is<00:05:11.229> that<00:05:11.349> they're<00:05:11.620> 15<00:05:12.099> so<00:05:12.430> if<00:05:12.610> you

00:05:12.719 --> 00:05:12.729 
other pro is that they're 15 so if you

00:05:12.729 --> 00:05:14.610 
other pro is that they're 15 so if you
were<00:05:12.849> in<00:05:12.970> a<00:05:13.030> large<00:05:13.300> hole<00:05:13.599> you<00:05:13.900> can<00:05:14.080> throw<00:05:14.320> sound

00:05:14.610 --> 00:05:14.620 
were in a large hole you can throw sound

00:05:14.620 --> 00:05:17.909 
were in a large hole you can throw sound
a<00:05:14.770> lot<00:05:14.919> further<00:05:15.449> it's<00:05:16.449> super<00:05:16.900> inexpensive<00:05:17.110> for

00:05:17.909 --> 00:05:17.919 
a lot further it's super inexpensive for

00:05:17.919 --> 00:05:19.830 
a lot further it's super inexpensive for
three<00:05:18.159> hundred<00:05:18.280> and<00:05:18.550> seventy<00:05:19.000> dollars<00:05:19.030> but

00:05:19.830 --> 00:05:19.840 
three hundred and seventy dollars but

00:05:19.840 --> 00:05:22.649 
three hundred and seventy dollars but
taxes<00:05:20.320> included<00:05:20.860> you<00:05:21.610> can't<00:05:22.030> really<00:05:22.300> get<00:05:22.479> any

215
also<00:06:05.400> the<00:06:06.400> worst<00:06:06.640> possible<00:06:07.060> thing<00:06:07.330> about<00:06:07.660> this

00:06:07.860 --> 00:06:07.870 
also the worst possible thing about this

00:06:07.870 --> 00:06:10.310 
also the worst possible thing about this
whole<00:06:08.110> thing<00:06:08.350> is<00:06:08.590> that<00:06:09.220> the<00:06:09.370> Bluetooth

00:06:10.310 --> 00:06:10.320 
whole thing is that the Bluetooth

00:06:10.320 --> 00:06:12.390 
whole thing is that the Bluetooth
transmission<00:06:11.320> is<00:06:11.410> the<00:06:11.560> worst<00:06:11.770> I've<00:06:11.980> ever<00:06:12.040> seen

00:06:12.390 --> 00:06:12.400 
transmission is the worst I've ever seen

00:06:12.400 --> 00:06:14.940 
transmission is the worst I've ever seen
I<00:06:12.610> cannot<00:06:13.060> stand<00:06:13.360> maybe<00:06:13.660> I<00:06:14.170> can<00:06:14.710> walk<00:06:14.830> away

00:06:14.940 --> 00:06:14.950 
I cannot stand maybe I can walk away

00:06:14.950 --> 00:06:16.710 
I cannot stand maybe I can walk away
maybe<00:06:15.190> three<00:06:15.550> feet<00:06:15.760> and<00:06:16.000> it<00:06:16.240> starts<00:06:16.540> getting

00:06:16.710 --> 00:06:16.720 
maybe three feet and it starts getting

00:06:16.720 --> 00:06:19.710 
maybe three feet and it starts getting
super<00:06:17.380> distorted<00:06:17.920> it<00:06:18.040> gets<00:06:18.190> cut<00:06:18.460> out<00:06:18.580> and<00:06:18.850> if

00:06:19.710 --> 00:06:19.720 
super distorted it gets cut out and if

00:06:19.720 --> 00:06:21.450 
super distorted it gets cut out and if
you<00:06:19.900> just<00:06:20.110> move<00:06:20.410> your<00:06:20.590> device<00:06:20.680> your<00:06:21.220> phone

whatever you have in your hand it gets
