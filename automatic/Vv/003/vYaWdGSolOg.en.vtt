the<00:00:13.130> next<00:00:13.460> technique<00:00:13.790> we'll<00:00:14.000> be<00:00:14.120> doing<00:00:14.389> is

00:00:14.620 --> 00:00:14.630 
the next technique we'll be doing is

00:00:14.630 --> 00:00:16.750 
the next technique we'll be doing is
sponge<00:00:15.019> painting<00:00:15.530> but<00:00:16.160> this<00:00:16.369> is<00:00:16.520> different

00:00:16.750 --> 00:00:16.760 
sponge painting but this is different

00:00:16.760 --> 00:00:18.580 
sponge painting but this is different
than<00:00:17.060> any<00:00:17.300> other<00:00:17.510> sponge<00:00:17.810> painting<00:00:18.230> you<00:00:18.410> may

00:00:18.580 --> 00:00:18.590 
than any other sponge painting you may

00:00:18.590 --> 00:00:20.830 
than any other sponge painting you may
have<00:00:18.710> done<00:00:18.830> in<00:00:18.980> the<00:00:19.070> past<00:00:19.279> we're<00:00:20.090> using<00:00:20.330> the

00:00:20.830 --> 00:00:20.840 
have done in the past we're using the

00:00:20.840 --> 00:00:23.710 
have done in the past we're using the
sponge<00:00:21.110> roller<00:00:21.500> now<00:00:22.400> if<00:00:22.550> you<00:00:22.700> look<00:00:22.910> closely<00:00:23.119> at

00:00:23.710 --> 00:00:23.720 
sponge roller now if you look closely at

00:00:23.720 --> 00:00:26.380 
sponge roller now if you look closely at
my<00:00:23.900> sponge<00:00:24.259> roller<00:00:24.619> it's<00:00:25.369> got<00:00:25.730> big<00:00:26.150> chunks

00:00:26.380 --> 00:00:26.390 
my sponge roller it's got big chunks

my sponge roller it's got big chunks
missing<00:00:27.349> up<00:00:27.500> from<00:00:27.800> it<00:00:27.950> the<00:00:28.730> reason<00:00:28.939> why<00:00:29.329> is

00:00:29.650 --> 00:00:29.660 
missing up from it the reason why is

00:00:29.660 --> 00:00:32.200 
missing up from it the reason why is
this<00:00:29.930> creates<00:00:30.349> the<00:00:30.529> variation<00:00:31.310> you<00:00:32.000> should

00:00:32.200 --> 00:00:32.210 
this creates the variation you should

00:00:32.210 --> 00:00:34.389 
this creates the variation you should
take<00:00:32.419> the<00:00:32.630> sponge<00:00:32.930> roller<00:00:33.260> and<00:00:33.530> pull<00:00:34.010> pieces

00:00:34.389 --> 00:00:34.399 
take the sponge roller and pull pieces

00:00:34.399 --> 00:00:37.420 
take the sponge roller and pull pieces
out<00:00:34.640> to<00:00:35.540> create<00:00:35.780> a<00:00:35.870> random<00:00:36.410> pattern<00:00:36.710> which<00:00:37.250> is

00:00:37.420 --> 00:00:37.430 
out to create a random pattern which is

00:00:37.430 --> 00:00:39.490 
out to create a random pattern which is
desirable<00:00:37.910> on<00:00:38.329> the<00:00:38.660> wall<00:00:38.809> surface<00:00:39.079> when

to stay a couple of columns ahead of me

00:01:48.030 --> 00:01:50.120 
to stay a couple of columns ahead of me
so<00:01:48.690> that<00:01:48.900> the<00:01:48.990> glaze<00:01:49.259> does<00:01:49.530> not<00:01:49.710> have<00:01:49.979> an

Julie's going ahead and applying more
glaze<00:01:57.930> to<00:01:58.170> her<00:01:58.350> roller<00:01:58.619> I'm<00:01:58.920> going<00:01:59.490> to<00:01:59.580> take<00:01:59.820> my

00:02:00.260 --> 00:02:00.270 
glaze to her roller I'm going to take my

00:02:00.270 --> 00:02:03.980 
glaze to her roller I'm going to take my
sponge<00:02:00.600> roller<00:02:00.960> and<00:02:01.259> create<00:02:02.190> a<00:02:02.630> pattern<00:02:03.630> by

00:02:03.980 --> 00:02:03.990 
sponge roller and create a pattern by

00:02:03.990 --> 00:02:05.420 
sponge roller and create a pattern by
rolling<00:02:04.440> through<00:02:04.680> and<00:02:04.770> cutting<00:02:05.100> through<00:02:05.310> the

00:02:05.420 --> 00:02:05.430 
rolling through and cutting through the

00:02:05.430 --> 00:02:08.410 
rolling through and cutting through the
glaze<00:02:05.700> I'm<00:02:06.000> going<00:02:06.600> to<00:02:06.690> roll<00:02:06.930> back<00:02:07.259> and<00:02:07.289> forth

00:02:08.410 --> 00:02:08.420 
glaze I'm going to roll back and forth

00:02:08.420 --> 00:02:12.020 
glaze I'm going to roll back and forth
to<00:02:09.420> create<00:02:09.450> the<00:02:09.780> look<00:02:10.220> keep<00:02:11.220> in<00:02:11.400> mind<00:02:11.610> the<00:02:11.790> more

00:02:12.020 --> 00:02:12.030 
to create the look keep in mind the more

00:02:12.030 --> 00:02:15.430 
to create the look keep in mind the more
you<00:02:12.090> roll<00:02:12.540> the<00:02:13.230> softer<00:02:13.709> the<00:02:13.860> look<00:02:14.040> will<00:02:14.250> become

00:02:15.430 --> 00:02:15.440 
you roll the softer the look will become

00:02:15.440 --> 00:02:18.170 
you roll the softer the look will become
so<00:02:16.440> if<00:02:16.590> you're<00:02:16.739> looking<00:02:16.920> for<00:02:17.130> a<00:02:17.340> real<00:02:17.610> muted

00:02:18.180 --> 00:02:19.970 
so if you're looking for a real muted
look<00:02:18.360> you'll<00:02:18.600> roll<00:02:18.840> it<00:02:18.989> more<00:02:19.230> if<00:02:19.470> you<00:02:19.620> want<00:02:19.890> it

00:02:19.970 --> 00:02:19.980

00:03:06.140 --> 00:03:06.150 
continuing to roll I'll do my rolling as

00:03:06.150 --> 00:03:11.080 
continuing to roll I'll do my rolling as
well

00:03:11.080 --> 00:03:11.090 

00:03:11.090 --> 00:03:13.150 

one<00:03:11.750> thing<00:03:12.020> that<00:03:12.200> is<00:03:12.319> different<00:03:12.560> as<00:03:12.920> I<00:03:13.069> had

00:03:13.150 --> 00:03:13.160 
one thing that is different as I had

00:03:13.160 --> 00:03:14.740 
one thing that is different as I had
mentioned<00:03:13.280> before<00:03:13.910> how<00:03:14.150> this<00:03:14.420> sponge

00:03:14.740 --> 00:03:14.750 
mentioned before how this sponge

00:03:14.750 --> 00:03:16.390 
mentioned before how this sponge
painting<00:03:15.110> is<00:03:15.260> different<00:03:15.739> than<00:03:15.950> the<00:03:16.040> type<00:03:16.220> of

00:03:16.390 --> 00:03:16.400 
painting is different than the type of

00:03:16.400 --> 00:03:18.370 
painting is different than the type of
sponge<00:03:16.670> painting<00:03:17.209> that<00:03:17.660> most<00:03:17.870> of<00:03:18.050> us<00:03:18.170> have

00:03:18.370 --> 00:03:18.380 
sponge painting that most of us have

00:03:18.380 --> 00:03:21.339 
sponge painting that most of us have
done<00:03:18.560> is<00:03:18.860> this<00:03:19.550> in<00:03:19.819> my<00:03:20.209> opinion<00:03:20.599> is<00:03:20.780> a<00:03:20.810> very

00:03:21.339 --> 00:03:21.349 
done is this in my opinion is a very

00:03:21.349 --> 00:03:23.710 
done is this in my opinion is a very
sophisticated<00:03:21.620> look<00:03:22.580> it's<00:03:23.030> not<00:03:23.239> the<00:03:23.300> same<00:03:23.690> old

00:03:23.710 --> 00:03:23.720 
sophisticated look it's not the same old

00:03:23.720 --> 00:03:25.930 
sophisticated look it's not the same old
look<00:03:24.140> that<00:03:24.319> we've<00:03:24.500> seen<00:03:24.770> for<00:03:24.980> years<00:03:25.280> I<00:03:25.610> think

00:03:25.930 --> 00:03:25.940 
look that we've seen for years I think

00:03:25.940 --> 00:03:27.040 
look that we've seen for years I think
it's<00:03:26.239> beautiful

00:03:27.040 --> 00:03:27.050 
it's beautiful

00:03:27.050 --> 00:03:29.290 
it's beautiful
so<00:03:27.980> that's<00:03:28.220> sponge<00:03:28.610> painting<00:03:29.030> with<00:03:29.269> the

00:03:29.290 --> 00:03:29.300 
so that's sponge painting with the

00:03:29.300 --> 00:03:31.449 
so that's sponge painting with the
sponge<00:03:29.690> painting<00:03:30.110> roller<00:03:30.380> thanks<00:03:31.280> for

00:03:31.449 --> 00:03:31.459
