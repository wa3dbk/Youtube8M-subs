I've<00:02:19.650> worked<00:02:20.129> with<00:02:20.280> a<00:02:20.340> company<00:02:20.519> over<00:02:20.879> in

00:02:20.899 --> 00:02:20.909 
I've worked with a company over in

00:02:20.909 --> 00:02:22.610 
I've worked with a company over in
Berlin<00:02:21.299> called<00:02:21.569> Shoop<00:02:21.900> ash<00:02:22.109> and<00:02:22.319> I<00:02:22.349> really

00:02:24.800 --> 00:02:24.810 
like some of their insulated boots there

00:02:24.810 --> 00:02:26.000 
like some of their insulated boots there
are<00:02:24.900> other<00:02:25.079> companies<00:02:25.319> out<00:02:25.620> there<00:02:25.680> that<00:02:25.859> will

00:02:26.000 --> 00:02:26.010 
are other companies out there that will

00:02:26.010 --> 00:02:28.369 
are other companies out there that will
use<00:02:26.370> different<00:02:26.939> materials<00:02:27.090> other<00:02:27.840> things<00:02:28.230> to

00:02:28.369 --> 00:02:28.379 
use different materials other things to

00:02:28.379 --> 00:02:30.379 
use different materials other things to
look<00:02:28.409> for<00:02:28.769> in<00:02:28.950> a<00:02:29.099> pair<00:02:29.280> of<00:02:29.310> insulated<00:02:30.030> boots<00:02:30.239> is

00:02:30.379 --> 00:02:30.389 
look for in a pair of insulated boots is

00:02:30.389 --> 00:02:32.300 
look for in a pair of insulated boots is
that<00:02:30.450> they're<00:02:30.900> a<00:02:30.930> bit<00:02:31.139> higher<00:02:31.500> up<00:02:31.769> off<00:02:32.069> the

00:02:32.300 --> 00:02:32.310 
that they're a bit higher up off the

00:02:32.310 --> 00:02:33.679 
that they're a bit higher up off the
ground<00:02:32.549> so<00:02:32.700> this<00:02:32.879> may<00:02:33.030> be<00:02:33.090> a<00:02:33.180> small<00:02:33.420> difference

00:02:33.679 --> 00:02:33.689 
ground so this may be a small difference

00:02:33.689 --> 00:02:35.479 
ground so this may be a small difference
and<00:02:34.200> we're<00:02:34.349> talking<00:02:34.530> in<00:02:34.739> some<00:02:34.950> cases<00:02:35.129> about<00:02:35.430> a

00:02:35.479 --> 00:02:35.489 
and we're talking in some cases about a

00:02:35.489 --> 00:02:37.309 
and we're talking in some cases about a
quarter<00:02:35.939> of<00:02:35.969> an<00:02:36.090> inch<00:02:36.180> but<00:02:36.689> that<00:02:36.810> quarter<00:02:37.230> of

00:02:37.309 --> 00:02:37.319 
quarter of an inch but that quarter of

00:02:37.319 --> 00:02:39.679 
quarter of an inch but that quarter of
an<00:02:37.409> inch<00:02:37.500> to<00:02:37.980> half<00:02:38.250> an<00:02:38.370> inch<00:02:38.549> can<00:02:38.969> make<00:02:39.150> a<00:02:39.269> big

00:02:39.679 --> 00:02:39.689 
an inch to half an inch can make a big

00:02:39.689 --> 00:02:42.110 
an inch to half an inch can make a big
difference<00:02:39.719> in<00:02:40.290> a<00:02:40.349> sense<00:02:40.920> of<00:02:41.099> distancing<00:02:41.909> you

00:02:42.110 --> 00:02:42.120 
difference in a sense of distancing you

00:02:42.120 --> 00:02:45.289 
difference in a sense of distancing you
and<00:02:42.349> insulating<00:02:43.349> you<00:02:43.500> from<00:02:43.530> the<00:02:44.519> very<00:02:44.790> cold

00:02:45.289 --> 00:02:45.299 
and insulating you from the very cold

00:02:45.299 --> 00:02:47.270 
and insulating you from the very cold
ground<00:02:45.629> so<00:02:46.109> anyone<00:02:46.500> that's<00:02:46.680> had<00:02:46.769> to<00:02:46.829> stand<00:02:47.159> in

00:02:47.270 --> 00:02:47.280 
ground so anyone that's had to stand in

00:02:47.280 --> 00:02:49.520 
ground so anyone that's had to stand in
a<00:02:47.340> bus<00:02:47.519> stop<00:02:47.760> for<00:02:48.090> half<00:02:48.389> an<00:02:48.540> hour<00:02:48.659> for<00:02:48.840> you<00:02:49.260> know

00:02:49.520 --> 00:02:49.530 
a bus stop for half an hour for you know

00:02:49.530 --> 00:02:52.039 
a bus stop for half an hour for you know
for<00:02:49.859> 25<00:02:50.280> minutes<00:02:50.519> in<00:02:50.760> cold<00:02:51.239> weather<00:02:51.569> can

00:02:52.039 --> 00:02:52.049 
for 25 minutes in cold weather can

00:02:52.049 --> 00:02:53.780 
for 25 minutes in cold weather can
really<00:02:52.109> appreciate<00:02:52.919> this<00:02:53.099> because<00:02:53.549> otherwise

00:02:53.780 --> 00:02:53.790 
really appreciate this because otherwise

00:02:53.790 --> 00:02:55.580 
really appreciate this because otherwise
that<00:02:54.120> cold<00:02:54.359> is<00:02:54.510> going<00:02:54.659> to<00:02:54.720> start<00:02:55.019> to<00:02:55.169> seep<00:02:55.379> up

00:02:55.580 --> 00:02:55.590 
that cold is going to start to seep up
