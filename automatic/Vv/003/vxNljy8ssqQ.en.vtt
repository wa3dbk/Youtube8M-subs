The Password

00:00:17.741 --> 00:00:19.866
– Father Beto...

00:00:20.403 --> 00:00:24.946
Now can you see what your intolerance
and lack of compassion have caused?

00:00:25.306 --> 00:00:28.261
Just look at what you’ve done to yourself.

00:00:30.101 --> 00:00:35.470
But you can get better, we can all get better.

00:00:35.988 --> 00:00:40.275
I am praying for you.
I always pray a little bit for you...

00:00:40.510 --> 00:00:43.670
Father Beto...
Father Beto!

00:00:51.636 --> 00:00:55.516
– Hello?
Hello!

00:00:56.130 --> 00:00:58.416
– Who are you?

00:00:58.665 --> 00:01:02.271
– Father Alberto Martínez.
Where is Saint Peter? I want to come in.

00:01:02.435 --> 00:01:07.136
– In order to enter you need a password.
Do you know it?

00:01:07.548 --> 00:01:12.033
– Oh great, so now you need a password
to get into Heaven.

00:01:12.311 --> 00:01:14.496
– What is going on here?

00:01:14.668 --> 00:01:20.683
– Saint Peter! It’s Father Beto, Alberto
Martínez, a Roman Catholic apostolic priest.

00:01:20.848 --> 00:01:23.553
I speak Latin and I know the Bible
like the back of my hand.

00:01:23.716 --> 00:01:24.710
– What do you want?

00:01:24.870 --> 00:01:29.101
– Father Beto wants to come in
but he doesn’t know the password.

00:01:29.390 --> 00:01:31.396
– We are not expecting anyone today.

00:01:31.560 --> 00:01:36.193
– I am a priest! You cannot shut
the gates of Paradise on a priest.

00:01:36.406 --> 00:01:40.816
– You may be a priest, but you are not
yet ready to enter the Kingdom of Heaven.

00:01:41.150 --> 00:01:44.663
These are the issues that you need to work on.

00:01:45.426 --> 00:01:49.666
Promote Jesus’ message of love, mercy and justice

00:01:49.868 --> 00:01:52.531
Work to help those who are excluded

00:01:52.881 --> 00:01:56.335
Respect human rights within the Church

00:01:56.678 --> 00:01:59.766
Demand justice in cases of clerical pedophilia

00:01:59.970 --> 00:02:03.323
Stop blaming women who are victims of violence

00:02:03.601 --> 00:02:06.826
Stop discriminating against gays and lesbians 

00:02:06.990 --> 00:02:11.608
Respect freedom of conscience and the right of
women and young to decide about their bodies

00:02:11.800 --> 00:02:14.846
Stop associating sexuality with guilt and sin

00:02:15.193 --> 00:02:18.548
Respect the secular State and stop interfering in politics.

00:02:18.841 --> 00:02:23.500
– My God, why had I not realized all of this?
Forgive me!

00:02:23.663 --> 00:02:27.591
– You have to return to Earth, Father Beto.
You have a second chance.

00:02:27.755 --> 00:02:29.900
– Aaaaaaaaah...

00:02:32.831 --> 00:02:35.010
– Do you think he will be able to change?

00:02:35.186 --> 00:02:37.543
– Who knows?
Let’s hope that when he opens his eyes,

00:02:37.715 --> 00:02:39.355
...he remembers at least some of this.

00:02:39.533 --> 00:02:41.861
– Father Beto, come back!

00:02:44.835 --> 00:02:47.495
Father Beto?
Father Beto!

00:02:48.188 --> 00:02:52.488
– Sister Juana...
– Father Beto, do you feel alright?

00:02:52.681 --> 00:02:56.910
– I could go for a chipilín tamal!
– He’s fine!

00:03:02.005 --> 00:03:05.670
And do you know the password?

00:03:05.943 --> 00:03:08.318
LOVE
