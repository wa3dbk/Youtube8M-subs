00:00:02.720 --> 00:00:08.300
let us now discuss the diffraction minima
due to a single slit diffraction pattern.

00:00:08.300 --> 00:00:15.590
we already discussed that if we have a small
slit. of slit width b. and on which a parallel

00:00:15.590 --> 00:00:18.680
beam of light is incident.

00:00:18.680 --> 00:00:21.320
in the direction theta from.

00:00:21.320 --> 00:00:26.329
the direction of incident light the resulting
intensity is given as i-not sine square beta

00:00:26.329 --> 00:00:27.329
by beta square.

00:00:27.329 --> 00:00:32.210
this we have discussed in the previous section.

00:00:32.210 --> 00:00:38.540
where the value of beta is written as pie
b sine theta by, lambda, in this situation

00:00:38.540 --> 00:00:43.800
this is the direction where theta is zero
or it is along the direction of incident light.

00:00:43.800 --> 00:00:49.530
if we calculate the light intensity in different
directions here you can see at theta is equal

00:00:49.530 --> 00:00:50.530
to zero.

00:00:50.530 --> 00:00:59.370
the value of beta is also getting zero and,
if we substitute limit, beta tend to zero,

00:00:59.370 --> 00:01:04.780
the value of sine beta by beta. this will
tend to unity.

00:01:04.780 --> 00:01:11.360
this implies the resultant intensity in the
direction of incident light will be i-not.

00:01:11.360 --> 00:01:14.290
and that is a maximum intensity in this direction.

00:01:14.290 --> 00:01:16.280
so this intensity we call.

00:01:16.280 --> 00:01:19.330
the central.

00:01:19.330 --> 00:01:27.780
diffraction maxima. because in the diffraction
of light in this surrounding of the single

00:01:27.780 --> 00:01:33.190
slit along theta equal to zero the maximum
intensity is produced which is called central

00:01:33.190 --> 00:01:34.979
diffraction maxima.

00:01:34.979 --> 00:01:41.240
now if we just analyze the intensity in various
directions, then we can see if we choose the

00:01:41.240 --> 00:01:46.540
value of theta, such that the value of beta
is becoming m pie.

00:01:46.540 --> 00:01:52.890
value of theta is such that beta value is
m pie. and if beta is m pie beta is non zero

00:01:52.890 --> 00:01:55.110
but sine beta will be zero.

00:01:55.110 --> 00:02:00.479
so here we can see the resulting intensity
in this situation will be zero.

00:02:00.479 --> 00:02:07.560
that is corresponding to a, minima. and when
beta is m pie if we use it here this will

00:02:07.560 --> 00:02:12.670
be m pie is equal to, pie b sine theta by
lambda.

00:02:12.670 --> 00:02:18.110
so here pie gets cancelled out and the value
of sine theta we are getting is.

00:02:18.110 --> 00:02:26.510
m lambda by b. now in this situation for various
values of m you must be careful here m must

00:02:26.510 --> 00:02:32.220
not be zero because we already taken beta
equal to zero corresponding to, central maxima.

00:02:32.220 --> 00:02:39.120
here if sine theta is equal to m lambda by
b, for various values of m, other then zero

00:02:39.120 --> 00:02:42.280
that is 1 2 and so on.

00:02:42.280 --> 00:02:44.010
we can write.

00:02:44.010 --> 00:02:46.190
there will be a.

00:02:46.190 --> 00:02:47.560
minima.

00:02:47.560 --> 00:02:55.090
so in this situation here we can write for
m is equal to 1. or this is the first.

00:02:55.090 --> 00:02:56.790
minima, we study.

00:02:56.790 --> 00:03:02.420
here the value of sine theta we are getting
is lambda by b or the value of theta we are

00:03:02.420 --> 00:03:04.950
getting is sine inverse of.

00:03:04.950 --> 00:03:11.360
lambda by b. this is the first angle, from
the direction of theta equal to zero above

00:03:11.360 --> 00:03:12.680
or below.

00:03:12.680 --> 00:03:20.310
where the light intensity will drop to zero,
so this can be written as, the angular width,

00:03:20.310 --> 00:03:25.790
or angular displacement of first minima from
the, central direction.

00:03:25.790 --> 00:03:33.410
so correspondingly we can write if. this is
the slit. from the direction of theta equal

00:03:33.410 --> 00:03:39.129
to zero say this angle is theta-1. this is
the direction theta-1 here and this is the

00:03:39.129 --> 00:03:46.950
direction theta-1 here, where we can say the,
first minima will occur on the 2 sides of

00:03:46.950 --> 00:03:48.470
central, maxima.

00:03:48.470 --> 00:03:52.760
so this is the angular width of.

00:03:52.760 --> 00:03:54.630
central maxima.

00:03:54.630 --> 00:03:58.540
so here we wish to calculate the angular width
of.

00:03:58.540 --> 00:04:06.830
central maxima that we can write as, 2 theta-1
this is theta c. which is twice of sine inverse

00:04:06.830 --> 00:04:12.909
of lambda by b. similarly, corresponding to
second minima, third minima, we can substitute

00:04:12.909 --> 00:04:20.030
the value of m is 2 3 4, and we can find out
the angular width of, various maxima.

00:04:20.030 --> 00:04:25.970
between first and second and so on because
we know that between 2 adjoining minima the

00:04:25.970 --> 00:04:27.040
width is, the maxima.
