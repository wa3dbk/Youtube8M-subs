00:01:29.009 --> 00:01:31.310 
personally I don't like having mini-map
rotate<00:01:29.460> I<00:01:29.579> like<00:01:29.759> it<00:01:29.909> to<00:01:29.970> be<00:01:30.060> fixed<00:01:30.540> and<00:01:30.869> then<00:01:31.259> I

00:01:31.310 --> 00:01:31.320 
rotate I like it to be fixed and then I

00:01:31.320 --> 00:01:33.469 
rotate I like it to be fixed and then I
can<00:01:31.500> rotate<00:01:31.650> myself<00:01:32.369> in<00:01:32.700> accordance<00:01:33.119> with<00:01:33.240> all

00:01:33.469 --> 00:01:33.479 
can rotate myself in accordance with all

00:01:33.479 --> 00:01:35.450 
can rotate myself in accordance with all
of<00:01:33.600> that<00:01:33.720> that's<00:01:34.350> basically<00:01:34.710> all<00:01:34.799> it<00:01:35.070> does<00:01:35.220> is

00:01:35.450 --> 00:01:35.460 
of that that's basically all it does is
