hi<00:00:01.680> I'm<00:00:02.010> Daniel<00:00:02.460> from<00:00:02.639> rally<00:00:02.790> offroad<00:00:03.360> now

00:00:03.800 --> 00:00:03.810 
hi I'm Daniel from rally offroad now

00:00:03.810 --> 00:00:05.450 
hi I'm Daniel from rally offroad now
when<00:00:03.990> you<00:00:04.110> put<00:00:04.319> a<00:00:04.350> serious<00:00:04.799> suspension<00:00:05.339> leaf

00:00:05.450 --> 00:00:05.460 
when you put a serious suspension leaf

00:00:05.460 --> 00:00:07.490 
when you put a serious suspension leaf
the<00:00:05.609> annual<00:00:05.879> vehicle<00:00:06.060> it's<00:00:06.569> much<00:00:06.930> more<00:00:07.290> than

00:00:07.490 --> 00:00:07.500 
the annual vehicle it's much more than

00:00:07.500 --> 00:00:09.500 
the annual vehicle it's much more than
just<00:00:07.529> springs<00:00:08.040> and<00:00:08.220> shock<00:00:08.370> absorbers<00:00:08.760> what

00:00:09.500 --> 00:00:09.510 
just springs and shock absorbers what

00:00:09.510 --> 00:00:11.570 
just springs and shock absorbers what
we're<00:00:09.690> looking<00:00:09.960> at<00:00:10.080> here<00:00:10.290> today<00:00:10.500> is<00:00:11.490> a

00:00:11.570 --> 00:00:11.580 
we're looking at here today is a

00:00:11.580 --> 00:00:14.330 
we're looking at here today is a
heavy-duty<00:00:12.030> and<00:00:12.509> extended<00:00:13.320> panhard<00:00:13.769> rod<00:00:13.920> and

00:00:14.330 --> 00:00:14.340 
heavy-duty and extended panhard rod and

00:00:14.340 --> 00:00:17.990 
heavy-duty and extended panhard rod and
an<00:00:15.000> extended<00:00:15.839> panhard<00:00:16.410> rod<00:00:16.560> bracket<00:00:17.279> the

00:00:17.990 --> 00:00:18.000 
an extended panhard rod bracket the

00:00:18.000 --> 00:00:20.929 
an extended panhard rod bracket the
reason<00:00:18.420> why<00:00:18.690> we<00:00:19.170> use<00:00:19.199> an<00:00:19.770> extended<00:00:20.250> panel<00:00:20.699> rod

00:00:20.929 --> 00:00:20.939 
reason why we use an extended panel rod

00:00:20.939 --> 00:00:23.240 
reason why we use an extended panel rod
is<00:00:21.480> because<00:00:21.869> when<00:00:22.080> the<00:00:22.230> vehicle<00:00:22.619> is<00:00:22.740> lifted

00:00:23.240 --> 00:00:23.250 
is because when the vehicle is lifted

00:00:23.250 --> 00:00:25.519 
is because when the vehicle is lifted
the<00:00:23.539> differential<00:00:24.539> moves<00:00:24.750> further<00:00:25.019> away<00:00:25.500> from

00:00:25.519 --> 00:00:25.529 
the differential moves further away from

00:00:25.529 --> 00:00:28.220 
the differential moves further away from
the<00:00:25.890> chassis<00:00:26.099> and<00:00:26.490> the<00:00:27.029> angle<00:00:27.480> of<00:00:27.570> the<00:00:27.750> panhard

00:00:28.220 --> 00:00:28.230 
the chassis and the angle of the panhard

00:00:28.230 --> 00:00:30.950 
the chassis and the angle of the panhard
rod<00:00:28.380> pulls<00:00:29.220> the<00:00:29.519> diff<00:00:29.789> across<00:00:30.359> the<00:00:30.510> one<00:00:30.660> side

00:00:30.950 --> 00:00:30.960 
rod pulls the diff across the one side

00:00:30.960 --> 00:00:33.110 
rod pulls the diff across the one side
of<00:00:31.080> the<00:00:31.140> vehicle<00:00:31.320> we<00:00:32.279> have<00:00:32.489> an<00:00:32.610> adjustable

00:00:33.110 --> 00:00:33.120 
of the vehicle we have an adjustable

00:00:33.120 --> 00:00:35.450 
of the vehicle we have an adjustable
panhard<00:00:33.420> rod<00:00:33.719> so<00:00:34.230> that<00:00:34.260> we<00:00:34.469> can<00:00:34.620> extend<00:00:35.040> it<00:00:35.280> to

00:00:35.450 --> 00:00:35.460 
panhard rod so that we can extend it to

00:00:35.460 --> 00:00:37.670 
panhard rod so that we can extend it to
the<00:00:35.489> correct<00:00:35.880> length<00:00:36.090> to<00:00:36.750> make<00:00:36.960> sure<00:00:37.260> that<00:00:37.559> the

00:00:37.670 --> 00:00:37.680 
the correct length to make sure that the

00:00:37.680 --> 00:00:40.880 
the correct length to make sure that the
track<00:00:37.950> of<00:00:38.100> the<00:00:38.160> vehicle<00:00:38.550> remains<00:00:39.030> central<00:00:39.890> the

00:00:40.880 --> 00:00:40.890 
track of the vehicle remains central the

00:00:40.890 --> 00:00:43.700 
track of the vehicle remains central the
reason<00:00:41.250> why<00:00:41.520> we<00:00:41.850> extend<00:00:42.420> the<00:00:42.780> panhard<00:00:43.320> mount

00:00:43.700 --> 00:00:43.710 
reason why we extend the panhard mount

00:00:43.710 --> 00:00:47.150 
reason why we extend the panhard mount
is<00:00:44.090> that<00:00:45.090> when<00:00:45.270> the<00:00:45.420> vehicle<00:00:45.780> is<00:00:45.930> lifted<00:00:46.500> we

00:00:47.150 --> 00:00:47.160 
is that when the vehicle is lifted we

00:00:47.160 --> 00:00:49.580 
is that when the vehicle is lifted we
need<00:00:47.430> to<00:00:47.910> compensate<00:00:48.329> for<00:00:48.840> the<00:00:48.960> angle<00:00:49.379> on<00:00:49.500> the

00:00:49.580 --> 00:00:49.590 
need to compensate for the angle on the

00:00:49.590 --> 00:00:52.850 
need to compensate for the angle on the
panhard<00:00:50.039> rod<00:00:50.250> the<00:00:51.090> reason<00:00:51.449> why<00:00:51.629> we<00:00:51.870> do<00:00:52.079> this<00:00:52.289> is

00:00:52.850 --> 00:00:52.860 
panhard rod the reason why we do this is

00:00:52.860 --> 00:00:55.040 
panhard rod the reason why we do this is
so<00:00:52.920> that<00:00:53.219> the<00:00:53.489> panhard<00:00:53.969> rod<00:00:54.090> is<00:00:54.360> working<00:00:54.930> in

00:00:55.040 --> 00:00:55.050 
so that the panhard rod is working in

00:00:55.050 --> 00:00:57.380 
so that the panhard rod is working in
almost<00:00:55.620> parallel<00:00:56.100> to<00:00:56.160> the<00:00:56.430> road<00:00:56.579> position<00:00:57.210> as

00:00:57.380 --> 00:00:57.390 
almost parallel to the road position as

00:00:57.390 --> 00:01:01.160 
almost parallel to the road position as
it<00:00:58.109> drops<00:00:58.410> down<00:00:58.530> the<00:00:59.399> angle<00:00:59.760> increases<00:01:00.270> and<00:01:01.079> it

00:01:01.160 --> 00:01:01.170 
it drops down the angle increases and it

00:01:01.170 --> 00:01:03.380 
it drops down the angle increases and it
pulls<00:01:01.410> the<00:01:01.620> differ<00:01:01.890> cross<00:01:02.309> further<00:01:02.670> we

00:01:03.380 --> 00:01:03.390 
pulls the differ cross further we

00:01:03.390 --> 00:01:05.509 
pulls the differ cross further we
experience<00:01:03.989> bump<00:01:04.320> steer<00:01:04.589> in<00:01:04.830> the<00:01:04.949> vehicle<00:01:05.369> and

00:01:05.509 --> 00:01:05.519 
experience bump steer in the vehicle and

00:01:05.519 --> 00:01:08.330 
experience bump steer in the vehicle and
other<00:01:05.970> handling<00:01:06.810> characteristics<00:01:07.340> which

00:01:08.330 --> 00:01:08.340 
other handling characteristics which

00:01:08.340 --> 00:01:12.109 
other handling characteristics which
aren't<00:01:08.640> very<00:01:08.850> good<00:01:10.549> now<00:01:11.549> when<00:01:11.970> you're

00:01:12.109 --> 00:01:12.119 
aren't very good now when you're

00:01:12.119 --> 00:01:15.380 
aren't very good now when you're
choosing<00:01:12.150> an<00:01:12.900> aftermarket<00:01:13.740> panhard<00:01:14.430> rod<00:01:14.580> the

00:01:15.380 --> 00:01:15.390 
choosing an aftermarket panhard rod the

00:01:15.390 --> 00:01:17.149 
choosing an aftermarket panhard rod the
most<00:01:15.600> important<00:01:16.170> things<00:01:16.380> to<00:01:16.530> look<00:01:16.680> for<00:01:16.950> is

00:01:17.149 --> 00:01:17.159 
most important things to look for is

00:01:17.159 --> 00:01:19.789 
most important things to look for is
first<00:01:17.610> of<00:01:17.820> all<00:01:17.939> that<00:01:18.180> it's<00:01:18.570> adjustable<00:01:18.900> we

00:01:19.789 --> 00:01:19.799 
first of all that it's adjustable we

00:01:19.799 --> 00:01:21.679 
first of all that it's adjustable we
need<00:01:19.979> to<00:01:20.100> make<00:01:20.280> sure<00:01:20.310> that<00:01:20.610> the<00:01:21.030> adjustment<00:01:21.570> is

00:01:21.679 --> 00:01:21.689 
need to make sure that the adjustment is

00:01:21.689 --> 00:01:24.440 
need to make sure that the adjustment is
simple<00:01:22.170> and<00:01:22.409> effective<00:01:22.880> the<00:01:23.880> welds<00:01:24.299> on<00:01:24.420> the

00:01:26.240 --> 00:01:26.250 
end of the panhard rod are obviously

00:01:26.250 --> 00:01:29.179 
end of the panhard rod are obviously
crucial<00:01:26.549> and<00:01:27.020> the<00:01:28.020> mounting<00:01:28.470> rings<00:01:28.740> and<00:01:29.070> the
