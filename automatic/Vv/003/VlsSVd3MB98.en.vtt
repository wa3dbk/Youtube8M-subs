00:00:23.180 --> 00:00:23.190 
just don't really think that the

00:00:23.190 --> 00:00:25.400 
just don't really think that the
pictures<00:00:23.520> ever<00:00:23.760> do<00:00:23.970> any<00:00:24.270> justice<00:00:24.480> so<00:00:24.900> I<00:00:24.930> don't

00:00:25.400 --> 00:00:25.410 
pictures ever do any justice so I don't
