00:03:54.960 --> 00:03:54.970 
aid I think and she says she didn't have

00:03:54.970 --> 00:03:56.610 
aid I think and she says she didn't have
any<00:03:55.150> problems<00:03:55.360> because<00:03:55.720> she<00:03:55.870> was<00:03:56.050> putting<00:03:56.530> it

00:03:56.610 --> 00:03:56.620 
any problems because she was putting it

00:03:56.620 --> 00:03:58.410 
any problems because she was putting it
in<00:03:56.769> and<00:03:57.069> they'd<00:03:57.190> stay<00:03:57.519> in<00:03:57.700> for<00:03:57.940> about<00:03:58.090> three

00:03:58.410 --> 00:03:58.420 
in and they'd stay in for about three

00:03:58.420 --> 00:04:00.000 
in and they'd stay in for about three
days<00:03:58.569> and<00:03:58.780> then<00:03:59.080> she<00:03:59.230> was<00:03:59.349> washing<00:03:59.620> my<00:03:59.769> hair

00:04:00.000 --> 00:04:00.010 
days and then she was washing my hair

00:04:00.010 --> 00:04:03.870 
days and then she was washing my hair
but<00:04:01.110> it's<00:04:02.110> probably<00:04:02.470> better<00:04:03.010> to<00:04:03.160> follow<00:04:03.640> the
