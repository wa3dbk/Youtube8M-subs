00:00:46.360 --> 00:00:46.370 
the history of analogies but anyway

00:00:46.370 --> 00:00:47.889

00:00:47.889 --> 00:00:47.899 
that's anyways that's besides the point

00:00:52.540 --> 00:00:52.550 
like as soon as I unlocked it I thought

00:00:52.550 --> 00:00:54.040 
like as soon as I unlocked it I thought
it<00:00:52.610> was<00:00:52.670> a<00:00:52.760> great<00:00:53.090> gun<00:00:53.329> and<00:00:53.510> then<00:00:53.600> when<00:00:53.840> I<00:00:53.930> was

00:00:54.050 --> 00:00:55.660 
it was a great gun and then when I was
ranking<00:00:54.350> it<00:00:54.469> up<00:00:54.620> I<00:00:54.770> thought<00:00:55.250> you<00:00:55.370> know<00:00:55.489> what

ranking it up I thought you know what
this<00:00:55.820> really<00:00:56.090> isn't<00:00:56.210> that<00:00:56.390> good<00:00:56.570> there's<00:00:56.930> a

ton<00:00:57.649> of<00:00:57.680> assault<00:00:58.160> rifles<00:00:58.460> that<00:00:58.550> are<00:00:58.670> better

00:00:58.810 --> 00:00:58.820 
ton of assault rifles that are better

00:00:58.820 --> 00:01:00.910 
ton of assault rifles that are better
than<00:00:58.910> better<00:00:59.420> than<00:00:59.600> this<00:00:59.719> which<00:01:00.230> is<00:01:00.440> true<00:01:00.649> it

00:01:00.910 --> 00:01:00.920

00:01:12.910 --> 00:01:12.920 
but the only the only bad thing about it

00:01:12.920 --> 00:01:15.760 
but the only the only bad thing about it
it<00:01:13.670> has<00:01:13.790> a<00:01:13.820> pretty<00:01:14.150> low<00:01:14.420> a<00:01:14.720> pretty<00:01:15.350> low<00:01:15.530> fire

00:01:15.760 --> 00:01:15.770 
it has a pretty low a pretty low fire

00:01:15.770 --> 00:01:17.469 
it has a pretty low a pretty low fire
rate<00:01:15.799> and<00:01:16.159> a<00:01:16.220> pretty<00:01:16.700> in<00:01:17.000> a<00:01:17.090> pretty<00:01:17.270> high

00:01:17.469 --> 00:01:17.479 
rate and a pretty in a pretty high

00:01:17.479 --> 00:01:19.929 
rate and a pretty in a pretty high
recoil<00:01:17.869> so<00:01:18.530> basically<00:01:19.280> if<00:01:19.520> you<00:01:19.640> figure<00:01:19.909> out

00:01:19.929 --> 00:01:19.939 
recoil so basically if you figure out

00:01:19.939 --> 00:01:21.880 
recoil so basically if you figure out
how<00:01:20.090> to<00:01:20.150> manage<00:01:20.330> the<00:01:20.600> recoil<00:01:20.960> correctly<00:01:21.470> this

00:01:21.880 --> 00:01:21.890 
how to manage the recoil correctly this

00:01:21.890 --> 00:01:24.100 
how to manage the recoil correctly this
gun<00:01:22.130> turns<00:01:22.369> into<00:01:22.729> put<00:01:23.030> a<00:01:23.060> pretty<00:01:23.210> good<00:01:23.450> gun<00:01:23.630> you

00:01:27.680 --> 00:01:29.350 
away like you can with a CR you gotta
really<00:01:27.890> burst<00:01:28.130> fire<00:01:28.400> much<00:01:28.670> more<00:01:28.909> with<00:01:29.060> it<00:01:29.150> but

00:01:29.350 --> 00:01:29.360

with<00:01:34.250> this<00:01:34.400> gun<00:01:34.610> um<00:01:34.970> I<00:01:35.299> found<00:01:36.229> the<00:01:36.320> kick<00:01:36.500> is

00:01:36.640 --> 00:01:36.650 
with this gun um I found the kick is

00:01:36.650 --> 00:01:39.100 
with this gun um I found the kick is
really<00:01:36.860> the<00:01:36.979> best<00:01:37.009> attachment<00:01:37.939> on<00:01:38.110> Sudanese

00:01:39.100 --> 00:01:39.110 
really the best attachment on Sudanese

00:01:39.110 --> 00:01:41.530 
really the best attachment on Sudanese
best<00:01:39.320> proficiency<00:01:39.979> on<00:01:40.009> the<00:01:40.400> cm<00:01:40.670> 901<00:01:40.820> just

00:01:41.530 --> 00:01:41.540 
best proficiency on the cm 901 just

00:01:41.540 --> 00:01:42.730 
best proficiency on the cm 901 just
because<00:01:41.780> it<00:01:41.869> does<00:01:41.990> have<00:01:42.170> that<00:01:42.259> pretty<00:01:42.530> high

00:01:42.730 --> 00:01:42.740 
because it does have that pretty high

00:01:42.740 --> 00:01:45.399 
because it does have that pretty high
recoil<00:01:43.130> from<00:01:43.340> far<00:01:43.640> away<00:01:43.670> and<00:01:44.060> I<00:01:45.020> run<00:01:45.170> the<00:01:45.259> sound

00:01:45.399 --> 00:01:45.409 
recoil from far away and I run the sound

00:01:45.409 --> 00:01:46.749 
recoil from far away and I run the sound
stir<00:01:45.650> because<00:01:45.710> I<00:01:45.860> don't<00:01:46.189> know<00:01:46.250> I<00:01:46.310> really<00:01:46.610> do

00:01:46.749 --> 00:01:46.759 
stir because I don't know I really do

00:01:46.759 --> 00:01:48.550

love the silencer in modern warfare 3 I

00:01:48.560 --> 00:01:50.980 
love the silencer in modern warfare 3 I
run<00:01:49.130> it<00:01:49.280> on<00:01:49.369> pretty<00:01:49.610> much<00:01:49.790> all<00:01:50.000> my<00:01:50.150> smgs<00:01:50.720> I<00:01:50.840> run

00:01:50.980 --> 00:01:50.990 
run it on pretty much all my smgs I run

00:01:50.990 --> 00:01:53.170 
run it on pretty much all my smgs I run
it<00:01:51.110> on<00:01:51.229> all<00:01:51.500> my<00:01:51.530> assault<00:01:52.369> rifles<00:01:52.729> pretty<00:01:53.000> much

00:01:53.170 --> 00:01:53.180 
it on all my assault rifles pretty much

00:01:53.180 --> 00:01:56.679 
it on all my assault rifles pretty much
except<00:01:53.570> for<00:01:53.720> like<00:01:53.840> the<00:01:54.049> type<00:01:54.680> 95<00:01:54.979> and<00:01:55.549> and<00:01:56.090> the

except for like the type 95 and and the

00:01:56.689 --> 00:01:59.200 
except for like the type 95 and and the
mk14<00:01:57.560> I<00:01:57.770> don't<00:01:58.070> run<00:01:58.220> a<00:01:58.430> silencer<00:01:58.909> on<00:01:58.939> because

00:01:59.200 --> 00:01:59.210 
mk14 I don't run a silencer on because

00:01:59.210 --> 00:02:00.490 
mk14 I don't run a silencer on because
because<00:01:59.390> those<00:01:59.540> guns<00:01:59.780> really<00:01:59.990> do<00:02:00.170> have<00:02:00.290> pretty

00:02:00.490 --> 00:02:00.500 
because those guns really do have pretty

00:02:00.500 --> 00:02:02.380 
because those guns really do have pretty
high<00:02:00.680> power<00:02:00.950> and<00:02:01.280> the<00:02:01.759> talents<00:02:02.090> are<00:02:02.180> really

00:02:02.380 --> 00:02:02.390 
high power and the talents are really

00:02:02.390 --> 00:02:03.850 
high power and the talents are really
kind<00:02:02.600> of<00:02:02.659> affected<00:02:02.960> but<00:02:03.110> even<00:02:03.680> though<00:02:03.770> this

00:02:03.850 --> 00:02:03.860 
kind of affected but even though this

00:02:03.860 --> 00:02:04.990 
kind of affected but even though this
gun<00:02:04.040> over<00:02:04.189> here<00:02:04.340> does<00:02:04.520> have<00:02:04.670> a<00:02:04.700> pretty<00:02:04.850> high

00:02:04.990 --> 00:02:05.000 
gun over here does have a pretty high

00:02:05.000 --> 00:02:07.270 
gun over here does have a pretty high
power<00:02:05.329> in<00:02:05.540> the<00:02:05.630> silencer<00:02:06.049> affects<00:02:06.770> its<00:02:06.979> range

00:02:07.270 --> 00:02:07.280 
power in the silencer affects its range

00:02:07.280 --> 00:02:10.359 
power in the silencer affects its range
it's<00:02:07.939> I<00:02:08.179> still<00:02:08.420> really<00:02:08.599> haven't<00:02:08.810> noticed<00:02:09.369> too

00:02:10.359 --> 00:02:10.369 
it's I still really haven't noticed too

00:02:10.369 --> 00:02:11.979 
it's I still really haven't noticed too
much<00:02:10.519> of<00:02:10.639> a<00:02:10.729> difference<00:02:11.059> I<00:02:11.239> still<00:02:11.689> find<00:02:11.840> this

00:02:11.979 --> 00:02:11.989 
much of a difference I still find this

00:02:11.989 --> 00:02:14.289 
much of a difference I still find this
gun<00:02:12.200> to<00:02:12.409> have<00:02:12.529> a<00:02:12.559> very<00:02:12.889> high<00:02:13.069> damage<00:02:13.430> even<00:02:14.150> with

00:02:14.289 --> 00:02:14.299 
gun to have a very high damage even with

00:02:14.299 --> 00:02:15.309 
gun to have a very high damage even with
the<00:02:14.389> silencer<00:02:14.809> on

00:02:15.309 --> 00:02:15.319 
the silencer on

00:02:15.319 --> 00:02:18.009 
the silencer on
it<00:02:15.349> really<00:02:15.499> keeps<00:02:15.650> you<00:02:15.829> off<00:02:15.950> that<00:02:16.129> UAV<00:02:17.019> gives

00:02:18.009 --> 00:02:18.019 
it really keeps you off that UAV gives

00:02:18.019 --> 00:02:19.660 
it really keeps you off that UAV gives
you<00:02:18.170> a<00:02:18.230> little<00:02:18.499> bit<00:02:18.680> of<00:02:18.769> a<00:02:18.829> sneaky<00:02:19.219> advantage

00:02:19.660 --> 00:02:19.670 
you a little bit of a sneaky advantage

00:02:19.670 --> 00:02:21.160 
you a little bit of a sneaky advantage
so<00:02:19.909> yeah<00:02:20.060> I<00:02:20.090> really<00:02:20.389> do<00:02:20.480> like<00:02:20.569> the<00:02:20.719> silencer

00:02:21.160 --> 00:02:21.170 
so yeah I really do like the silencer

00:02:21.170 --> 00:02:25.179 
so yeah I really do like the silencer
and<00:02:21.349> I'm<00:02:22.450> I've<00:02:23.450> found<00:02:24.139> out<00:02:24.349> that<00:02:24.499> sitrep<00:02:24.980> pro

00:02:25.179 --> 00:02:25.189 
and I'm I've found out that sitrep pro

00:02:25.189 --> 00:02:28.179 
and I'm I've found out that sitrep pro
is<00:02:25.579> probably<00:02:26.569> my<00:02:26.810> favorite<00:02:26.840> third<00:02:27.680> tier<00:02:27.889> perk

00:02:28.179 --> 00:02:28.189 
is probably my favorite third tier perk

00:02:28.189 --> 00:02:30.309 
is probably my favorite third tier perk
for<00:02:28.370> this<00:02:28.489> gun<00:02:28.700> I<00:02:28.939> used<00:02:29.150> to<00:02:29.450> run<00:02:29.569> stalker<00:02:29.900> on<00:02:30.170> it

00:02:30.309 --> 00:02:30.319 
for this gun I used to run stalker on it

00:02:30.319 --> 00:02:32.649 
for this gun I used to run stalker on it
but<00:02:30.889> um<00:02:31.159> but<00:02:31.579> I<00:02:31.670> figured<00:02:31.969> out<00:02:32.060> that<00:02:32.239> I'm<00:02:32.389> but

00:02:32.649 --> 00:02:32.659 
but um but I figured out that I'm but

00:02:32.659 --> 00:02:38.170 
but um but I figured out that I'm but
that<00:02:33.370> the<00:02:34.370> 1i<00:02:34.549> Ron<00:02:34.819> sitrep<00:02:35.269> pro<00:02:35.680> I<00:02:37.150> seemed<00:02:38.150> to

00:02:38.170 --> 00:02:38.180 
that the 1i Ron sitrep pro I seemed to

00:02:38.180 --> 00:02:39.789 
that the 1i Ron sitrep pro I seemed to
hear<00:02:38.420> the<00:02:38.599> enemies<00:02:38.900> much<00:02:39.290> better<00:02:39.590> which<00:02:39.769> is

00:02:39.789 --> 00:02:39.799 
hear the enemies much better which is

00:02:39.799 --> 00:02:41.530 
hear the enemies much better which is
obviously<00:02:40.280> what<00:02:40.370> the<00:02:40.730> pro<00:02:40.909> variant<00:02:41.329> does

00:02:41.530 --> 00:02:41.540 
obviously what the pro variant does

00:02:41.540 --> 00:02:43.509 
obviously what the pro variant does
allows<00:02:42.200> you<00:02:42.409> to<00:02:42.560> hear<00:02:42.680> the<00:02:42.829> enemies<00:02:43.129> of<00:02:43.159> the

00:02:43.509 --> 00:02:43.519 
allows you to hear the enemies of the

00:02:43.519 --> 00:02:45.759 
allows you to hear the enemies of the
enemy<00:02:43.760> footsteps<00:02:43.969> much<00:02:44.450> louder<00:02:44.780> and<00:02:45.109> if<00:02:45.680> you

00:02:45.759 --> 00:02:45.769 
enemy footsteps much louder and if you

00:02:45.769 --> 00:02:48.490 
enemy footsteps much louder and if you

00:02:57.339 --> 00:02:57.349 
much noise going on so i would highly

00:02:57.349 --> 00:02:59.080 
much noise going on so i would highly
recommend<00:02:57.530> getting<00:02:57.980> sitrep<00:02:58.400> pro<00:02:58.549> it's<00:02:58.790> great

00:02:59.080 --> 00:02:59.090 
recommend getting sitrep pro it's great

00:02:59.090 --> 00:03:01.149 
recommend getting sitrep pro it's great
and<00:02:59.329> hardline<00:02:59.989> pro<00:03:00.139> is<00:03:00.319> really<00:03:00.530> good<00:03:00.709> too

00:03:01.149 --> 00:03:01.159 
and hardline pro is really good too

00:03:01.159 --> 00:03:03.159 
and hardline pro is really good too
especially<00:03:01.400> when<00:03:01.760> i'm<00:03:01.849> running<00:03:01.969> the<00:03:02.510> 357

00:03:03.159 --> 00:03:03.169 
especially when i'm running the 357

00:03:03.169 --> 00:03:04.929 
especially when i'm running the 357
streaks<00:03:03.560> like<00:03:03.650> I<00:03:03.769> wasn't<00:03:03.949> this<00:03:04.099> game<00:03:04.280> I<00:03:04.549> mean

00:03:04.929 --> 00:03:04.939 
streaks like I wasn't this game I mean

00:03:04.939 --> 00:03:06.640 
streaks like I wasn't this game I mean
you<00:03:05.000> get<00:03:05.269> a<00:03:05.329> UAV<00:03:05.659> after<00:03:06.019> you<00:03:06.109> get<00:03:06.230> two<00:03:06.409> points

00:03:06.640 --> 00:03:06.650 
you get a UAV after you get two points

00:03:06.650 --> 00:03:09.759 
you get a UAV after you get two points
and<00:03:07.389> so<00:03:08.389> that's<00:03:08.780> that's<00:03:08.870> pretty<00:03:08.989> awesome<00:03:09.230> and

00:03:09.759 --> 00:03:09.769 
and so that's that's pretty awesome and

mandatory<00:03:37.939> ins<00:03:38.329> gun<00:03:38.540> I<00:03:38.720> think<00:03:39.139> the<00:03:39.229> iron

00:03:39.399 --> 00:03:39.409 
mandatory ins gun I think the iron

00:03:39.409 --> 00:03:40.749 
mandatory ins gun I think the iron
sights<00:03:39.709> are<00:03:39.859> really<00:03:40.189> good<00:03:40.489> in<00:03:40.519> my<00:03:40.729> opinion

00:03:40.749 --> 00:03:40.759 
sights are really good in my opinion

00:03:40.759 --> 00:03:42.699 
sights are really good in my opinion
they're<00:03:41.209> pretty<00:03:41.359> original<00:03:41.840> it's<00:03:42.109> like<00:03:42.409> it's

00:03:42.699 --> 00:03:42.709 
they're pretty original it's like it's

00:03:42.709 --> 00:03:44.259 
they're pretty original it's like it's
kind<00:03:42.919> of<00:03:42.949> a<00:03:43.069> different<00:03:43.459> iron<00:03:43.759> sights<00:03:44.030> but<00:03:44.180> I

00:03:44.259 --> 00:03:44.269 
kind of a different iron sights but I

00:03:44.269 --> 00:03:45.879 
kind of a different iron sights but I
think<00:03:44.479> they're<00:03:44.599> pretty<00:03:44.780> nice<00:03:45.019> so<00:03:45.650> I<00:03:45.680> don't

00:03:45.879 --> 00:03:45.889 
think they're pretty nice so I don't

00:03:45.889 --> 00:03:46.899 
think they're pretty nice so I don't
think<00:03:46.009> the<00:03:46.069> red<00:03:46.220> dot<00:03:46.400> is<00:03:46.519> really<00:03:46.729> all<00:03:46.819> that

00:03:46.899 --> 00:03:46.909 
think the red dot is really all that

00:03:46.909 --> 00:03:48.640 
think the red dot is really all that
mandatory<00:03:47.209> but<00:03:47.449> like<00:03:47.540> I<00:03:47.629> was<00:03:47.720> saying<00:03:47.780> go<00:03:48.439> try
