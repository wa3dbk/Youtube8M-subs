00:02:00.380 --> 00:02:00.390 
for North Carolina so they were able to

00:02:00.390 --> 00:02:04.100 
for North Carolina so they were able to
pull<00:02:00.600> out<00:02:00.719> the<00:02:00.930> upset<00:02:01.560> over<00:02:02.219> Duke<00:02:02.869> how<00:02:03.869> they

00:02:11.240 --> 00:02:11.250 
about 81 points per game

00:02:11.250 --> 00:02:13.670 
about 81 points per game
which<00:02:11.850> is<00:02:12.000> one<00:02:12.180> of<00:02:12.210> the<00:02:12.330> highest<00:02:12.540> averages<00:02:13.410> in
