like it Erin I'm pretty sure you will so
we'll<00:00:41.760> start<00:00:41.999> off<00:00:42.179> with<00:00:42.510> how<00:00:43.050> the<00:00:43.109> electronics

00:00:43.759 --> 00:00:43.769 
we'll start off with how the electronics

00:00:43.769 --> 00:00:46.220 
we'll start off with how the electronics
are<00:00:43.890> mounted<00:00:44.190> in<00:00:44.309> here<00:00:44.749> and<00:00:45.749> some<00:00:46.079> of<00:00:46.170> the

00:00:46.220 --> 00:00:46.230 
are mounted in here and some of the

00:00:46.230 --> 00:00:52.399 
are mounted in here and some of the
brackets<00:00:46.940> so<00:00:47.989> the<00:00:48.989> speed<00:00:49.769> control<00:00:50.190> is<00:00:51.409> mounted

00:00:52.399 --> 00:00:52.409 
brackets so the speed control is mounted

00:00:52.409 --> 00:00:54.680 
brackets so the speed control is mounted
to<00:00:52.440> the<00:00:52.739> center<00:00:53.069> rib<00:00:53.339> and<00:00:53.550> the<00:00:53.969> B<00:00:54.089> EC<00:00:54.510> is

00:00:54.680 --> 00:00:54.690 
to the center rib and the B EC is

00:00:54.690 --> 00:00:56.719 
to the center rib and the B EC is
mounted<00:00:55.140> to<00:00:55.170> this<00:00:55.379> outer<00:00:55.620> rim<00:00:55.979> so<00:00:56.370> that<00:00:56.550> it's

00:00:56.719 --> 00:00:56.729 
mounted to this outer rim so that it's

00:00:56.729 --> 00:00:59.689 
mounted to this outer rim so that it's
not<00:00:56.879> in<00:00:56.940> the<00:00:57.149> way<00:00:57.420> of<00:00:57.569> any<00:00:57.780> of<00:00:57.960> the<00:00:58.319> screws<00:00:58.699> for

00:00:59.689 --> 00:00:59.699 
not in the way of any of the screws for

00:00:59.699 --> 00:01:01.790 
not in the way of any of the screws for
remounting<00:00:59.940> the<00:01:00.210> cab<00:01:00.449> the<00:01:01.109> speed<00:01:01.379> controls

remounting the cab the speed controls

00:01:01.800 --> 00:01:03.559 
remounting the cab the speed controls
just<00:01:02.069> kind<00:01:02.249> of<00:01:02.309> set<00:01:02.519> in<00:01:02.670> here<00:01:02.850> for<00:01:03.059> now<00:01:03.179> I<00:01:03.210> still

00:01:03.559 --> 00:01:03.569 
just kind of set in here for now I still

00:01:03.569 --> 00:01:06.140 
just kind of set in here for now I still
got<00:01:03.719> to<00:01:03.809> move<00:01:03.929> some<00:01:03.989> stuff<00:01:04.470> around<00:01:04.799> and<00:01:05.220> attach

00:01:06.140 --> 00:01:06.150 
got to move some stuff around and attach

00:01:06.150 --> 00:01:10.700 
got to move some stuff around and attach
the<00:01:06.390> wires<00:01:06.570> for<00:01:06.900> all<00:01:06.960> actuators<00:01:07.620> I<00:01:09.440> did<00:01:10.440> have

00:01:10.700 --> 00:01:10.710 
the wires for all actuators I did have

00:01:10.710 --> 00:01:14.990 
the wires for all actuators I did have
find<00:01:11.400> that<00:01:11.760> I<00:01:11.820> had<00:01:12.090> to<00:01:12.560> cut<00:01:13.560> a<00:01:13.830> lot<00:01:14.400> further<00:01:14.730> all

00:01:14.990 --> 00:01:15.000 
find that I had to cut a lot further all

00:01:15.000 --> 00:01:17.990 
find that I had to cut a lot further all
the<00:01:15.030> way<00:01:15.240> to<00:01:15.300> the<00:01:15.510> top<00:01:16.400> almost<00:01:17.400> all<00:01:17.670> the<00:01:17.820> way<00:01:17.940> to

00:01:17.990 --> 00:01:18.000 
the way to the top almost all the way to

00:01:18.000 --> 00:01:22.700 
the way to the top almost all the way to
the<00:01:18.690> metal<00:01:19.110> to<00:01:20.100> make<00:01:20.280> the<00:01:20.430> actuator<00:01:20.970> fit<00:01:21.710> with

00:01:22.700 --> 00:01:22.710 
the metal to make the actuator fit with

00:01:22.710 --> 00:01:24.080 
the metal to make the actuator fit with
where<00:01:22.920> the<00:01:23.070> cab<00:01:23.280> mounts<00:01:23.730> and<00:01:23.880> where<00:01:23.970> the

00:01:24.080 --> 00:01:24.090 
where the cab mounts and where the

00:01:24.090 --> 00:01:26.240 
where the cab mounts and where the
actuator<00:01:24.510> mounts<00:01:24.930> I<00:01:25.140> had<00:01:25.560> to<00:01:25.680> do<00:01:25.800> that<00:01:25.980> on<00:01:26.130> the

00:01:26.240 --> 00:01:26.250 
actuator mounts I had to do that on the

00:01:26.250 --> 00:01:28.010 
actuator mounts I had to do that on the
other<00:01:26.400> one<00:01:26.640> but<00:01:26.820> I<00:01:26.850> wasn't<00:01:27.060> sure<00:01:27.210> quite<00:01:27.840> sure

00:01:28.010 --> 00:01:28.020 
other one but I wasn't sure quite sure

00:01:28.020 --> 00:01:29.920 
other one but I wasn't sure quite sure
if<00:01:28.140> I<00:01:28.230> had<00:01:28.380> to<00:01:28.470> do<00:01:28.590> that<00:01:28.740> on<00:01:28.800> this<00:01:29.100> one<00:01:29.250> or<00:01:29.370> not

00:01:29.920 --> 00:01:29.930 
if I had to do that on this one or not

00:01:29.930 --> 00:01:34.910 
if I had to do that on this one or not
so<00:01:30.930> these<00:01:31.140> brackets<00:01:31.470> are<00:01:32.120> oh<00:01:33.770> they're<00:01:34.770> about

00:01:34.910 --> 00:01:34.920 
so these brackets are oh they're about

00:01:34.920 --> 00:01:39.170 
so these brackets are oh they're about
eighth<00:01:35.280> inch<00:01:35.580> aluminum<00:01:37.520> 5/8<00:01:38.520> of<00:01:38.670> an<00:01:38.820> inch<00:01:38.910> wide

00:01:39.170 --> 00:01:39.180 
eighth inch aluminum 5/8 of an inch wide

00:01:39.180 --> 00:01:44.140 
eighth inch aluminum 5/8 of an inch wide
a<00:01:41.030> 3/4<00:01:42.030> inch<00:01:42.060> or<00:01:42.450> half<00:01:42.570> inch<00:01:42.780> would<00:01:43.050> work<00:01:43.200> also

00:01:44.140 --> 00:01:44.150 
a 3/4 inch or half inch would work also

00:01:44.150 --> 00:01:48.890 
a 3/4 inch or half inch would work also
they're<00:01:45.150> not<00:01:45.450> quite<00:01:46.020> a<00:01:46.050> 90<00:01:46.710> degree<00:01:46.980> Bend<00:01:47.900> kind

00:01:48.890 --> 00:01:48.900 
they're not quite a 90 degree Bend kind

00:01:48.900 --> 00:01:53.090 
they're not quite a 90 degree Bend kind
of<00:01:48.990> gotta<00:01:49.170> just<00:01:49.940> eyeball<00:01:50.940> it<00:01:50.970> and<00:01:52.070> guess<00:01:53.070> and

00:01:53.090 --> 00:01:53.100 
of gotta just eyeball it and guess and

00:01:53.100 --> 00:01:55.760 
of gotta just eyeball it and guess and
check<00:01:53.310> guess<00:01:53.940> and<00:01:54.150> check<00:01:54.180> and<00:01:54.630> once<00:01:55.530> you<00:01:55.620> get

00:01:55.760 --> 00:01:55.770 
check guess and check and once you get

00:01:55.770 --> 00:01:58.910 
check guess and check and once you get
the<00:01:55.860> right<00:01:56.040> angle<00:01:57.170> drill<00:01:58.170> all<00:01:58.380> the<00:01:58.500> holes<00:01:58.530> in

00:01:58.910 --> 00:01:58.920 
the right angle drill all the holes in

00:01:58.920 --> 00:02:04.440 
the right angle drill all the holes in
them<00:02:00.260> and<00:02:01.260> get<00:02:01.470> everything<00:02:01.680> all<00:02:01.920> mounted<00:02:02.250> up

00:02:04.440 --> 00:02:04.450 

00:02:04.450 --> 00:02:06.590 

the<00:02:04.870> brackets<00:02:05.290> on<00:02:05.410> the<00:02:05.440> sides<00:02:05.740> are<00:02:06.070> very

00:02:06.590 --> 00:02:06.600 
the brackets on the sides are very

00:02:06.600 --> 00:02:10.230 
the brackets on the sides are very
difficult<00:02:07.600> to<00:02:07.840> drill<00:02:08.800> the<00:02:08.890> holes<00:02:09.240> just

00:02:10.230 --> 00:02:10.240 
difficult to drill the holes just

00:02:10.240 --> 00:02:11.610 
difficult to drill the holes just
because<00:02:10.570> there's<00:02:10.750> a<00:02:10.840> lot<00:02:10.990> of<00:02:11.050> things<00:02:11.350> in<00:02:11.530> the

00:02:11.610 --> 00:02:11.620 
because there's a lot of things in the

00:02:11.620 --> 00:02:15.180 
because there's a lot of things in the
way<00:02:11.770> and<00:02:13.020> you<00:02:14.020> just<00:02:14.050> can't<00:02:14.440> get<00:02:14.590> a<00:02:14.650> really<00:02:15.070> good

00:02:15.180 --> 00:02:15.190 
way and you just can't get a really good

00:02:15.190 --> 00:02:21.870 
way and you just can't get a really good
straight<00:02:15.520> shot<00:02:15.760> at<00:02:15.970> it<00:02:16.120> so<00:02:18.840> that's<00:02:19.840> the<00:02:20.020> cab<00:02:20.880> it

00:02:21.870 --> 00:02:21.880 
straight shot at it so that's the cab it

00:02:21.880 --> 00:02:25.170 
straight shot at it so that's the cab it
just<00:02:22.120> screws<00:02:22.600> right<00:02:22.900> onto<00:02:23.200> the<00:02:23.290> frame<00:02:24.180> the

00:02:25.170 --> 00:02:25.180 
just screws right onto the frame the

00:02:25.180 --> 00:02:27.200 
just screws right onto the frame the
next<00:02:25.450> video<00:02:25.750> I<00:02:25.810> will<00:02:26.110> have<00:02:26.140> the<00:02:26.410> cab<00:02:26.620> mounted

00:02:27.200 --> 00:02:27.210 
next video I will have the cab mounted

00:02:27.210 --> 00:02:30.210 
next video I will have the cab mounted
to<00:02:28.210> show<00:02:28.420> you<00:02:28.480> how<00:02:28.660> it<00:02:28.780> mounts<00:02:28.900> up<00:02:29.200> I'm<00:02:29.770> going

00:02:30.210 --> 00:02:30.220 
to show you how it mounts up I'm going

00:02:30.220 --> 00:02:32.820 
to show you how it mounts up I'm going
to<00:02:30.459> remove<00:02:31.360> all<00:02:31.510> the<00:02:31.570> brackets<00:02:32.110> actually<00:02:32.709> that

00:02:32.820 --> 00:02:32.830 
to remove all the brackets actually that

00:02:32.830 --> 00:02:34.380 
to remove all the brackets actually that
probably<00:02:33.100> won't<00:02:33.220> be<00:02:33.340> the<00:02:33.550> next<00:02:33.850> video<00:02:34.180> that

00:02:34.380 --> 00:02:34.390 
probably won't be the next video that

00:02:34.390 --> 00:02:36.390 
probably won't be the next video that
will<00:02:34.480> probably<00:02:34.780> be<00:02:34.900> the<00:02:34.930> the<00:02:35.740> next<00:02:36.040> one<00:02:36.190> after

00:02:36.390 --> 00:02:36.400 
will probably be the the next one after

00:02:36.400 --> 00:02:40.350 
will probably be the the next one after
that<00:02:38.310> as<00:02:39.310> I<00:02:39.459> still<00:02:39.700> got<00:02:39.820> to<00:02:39.940> show<00:02:40.060> you<00:02:40.120> the

00:02:40.350 --> 00:02:40.360 
that as I still got to show you the

00:02:40.360 --> 00:02:42.720 
that as I still got to show you the
tailgate<00:02:41.100> we'll<00:02:42.100> do<00:02:42.250> that<00:02:42.370> later

00:02:42.720 --> 00:02:42.730 
tailgate we'll do that later

00:02:42.730 --> 00:02:48.030 
tailgate we'll do that later
so<00:02:43.510> these<00:02:43.690> brackets<00:02:44.700> just<00:02:45.700> screw<00:02:46.000> on<00:02:47.040> screws

00:02:48.030 --> 00:02:48.040 
so these brackets just screw on screws

00:02:48.040 --> 00:02:52.590 
so these brackets just screw on screws

00:03:31.979 --> 00:03:31.989 
it up higher if you cut more off to make

it up higher if you cut more off to make
it<00:03:32.110> sit<00:03:32.320> a<00:03:32.350> little<00:03:32.530> lower<00:03:32.680> I<00:03:33.540> tried<00:03:34.540> to<00:03:34.660> make

00:03:34.770 --> 00:03:34.780 
it sit a little lower I tried to make

00:03:37.060 --> 00:03:40.800 
try to make them sit about the stock
height<00:03:37.980> so<00:03:38.980> it's<00:03:39.190> it's<00:03:39.489> cut<00:03:39.940> like<00:03:40.180> this<00:03:40.480> with

00:03:40.800 --> 00:03:40.810 
height so it's it's cut like this with

00:03:40.810 --> 00:03:43.170 
height so it's it's cut like this with
these<00:03:40.930> angles<00:03:41.320> on<00:03:41.440> the<00:03:41.530> top<00:03:41.739> so<00:03:42.040> that<00:03:42.180> these

00:03:43.170 --> 00:03:43.180 
these angles on the top so that these

00:03:43.180 --> 00:03:46.289 
these angles on the top so that these
this<00:03:44.110> part<00:03:44.530> of<00:03:44.709> this<00:03:44.860> bracket<00:03:45.160> misses<00:03:46.000> where

this part of this bracket misses where
the<00:03:46.480> screws<00:03:46.840> go<00:03:47.290> through<00:03:48.100> to<00:03:48.310> attach<00:03:48.640> the<00:03:48.970> back

00:03:49.140 --> 00:03:49.150 
the screws go through to attach the back

00:03:49.150 --> 00:03:55.710 
the screws go through to attach the back
of<00:03:49.330> the<00:03:49.390> cab<00:03:49.630> you<00:03:51.780> got<00:03:52.780> to<00:03:52.900> do<00:03:52.989> that<00:03:53.200> or<00:03:54.510> you<00:03:55.510> got

00:03:55.710 --> 00:03:55.720 
of the cab you got to do that or you got

00:03:55.720 --> 00:03:57.600 
of the cab you got to do that or you got
stuff<00:03:56.290> sitting<00:03:56.650> on<00:03:56.709> top<00:03:56.890> of<00:03:56.950> screws<00:03:57.340> and<00:03:57.489> that

00:03:57.600 --> 00:03:57.610 
stuff sitting on top of screws and that

00:03:57.610 --> 00:04:01.390 
stuff sitting on top of screws and that
just<00:03:57.850> doesn't<00:03:58.030> work

00:04:01.390 --> 00:04:01.400 

00:04:01.400 --> 00:04:06.610 

that<00:04:02.400> is<00:04:02.760> the<00:04:02.910> actuator<00:04:03.860> so<00:04:04.860> it<00:04:04.980> goes<00:04:05.160> in<00:04:05.370> there

00:04:06.610 --> 00:04:06.620 
that is the actuator so it goes in there

00:04:06.620 --> 00:04:11.990 
that is the actuator so it goes in there
got<00:04:07.620> to<00:04:07.770> put<00:04:07.890> it<00:04:07.980> in<00:04:08.100> from<00:04:08.310> the<00:04:08.400> bottom<00:04:11.000> amounts

00:04:11.990 --> 00:04:12.000 
got to put it in from the bottom amounts

00:04:12.000 --> 00:04:14.690 
got to put it in from the bottom amounts
approximately<00:04:12.720> right<00:04:12.900> there<00:04:13.140> and<00:04:13.950> the<00:04:14.460> top<00:04:14.670> of

approximately right there and the top of
the<00:04:14.910> actuator<00:04:15.650> bounce<00:04:16.650> to<00:04:17.549> this<00:04:17.700> little

00:04:18.050 --> 00:04:18.060 
the actuator bounce to this little

00:04:18.060 --> 00:04:21.080 
the actuator bounce to this little
clevis<00:04:18.390> up<00:04:18.570> here<00:04:19.190> which<00:04:20.190> comes<00:04:20.730> with<00:04:21.030> the

00:04:21.080 --> 00:04:21.090 
clevis up here which comes with the

00:04:21.090 --> 00:04:24.620 
clevis up here which comes with the
actuator<00:04:22.520> once<00:04:23.520> you<00:04:23.610> get<00:04:23.760> this<00:04:23.880> lower<00:04:24.090> bracket

00:04:24.620 --> 00:04:24.630

figured<00:04:26.640> out<00:04:26.760> where<00:04:27.000> you<00:04:27.030> want<00:04:27.300> it<00:04:27.420> to<00:04:27.540> go<00:04:28.010> you

00:04:29.000 --> 00:04:29.010 
figured out where you want it to go you

00:04:29.010 --> 00:04:32.420 
figured out where you want it to go you
can<00:04:29.250> close<00:04:30.120> the<00:04:30.330> dump<00:04:30.510> box<00:04:30.720> to<00:04:31.020> where<00:04:31.230> you<00:04:32.190> want

00:04:32.420 --> 00:04:32.430 
can close the dump box to where you want

00:04:32.430 --> 00:04:35.690 
can close the dump box to where you want
the<00:04:32.940> closed<00:04:33.240> spot<00:04:33.750> to<00:04:33.990> be<00:04:34.110> at<00:04:34.350> I<00:04:34.650> guess<00:04:35.520> that

00:04:35.690 --> 00:04:35.700 
the closed spot to be at I guess that

00:04:35.700 --> 00:04:38.150 
the closed spot to be at I guess that
you<00:04:35.850> took<00:04:36.030> and<00:04:36.330> cut<00:04:37.140> in<00:04:37.260> the<00:04:37.350> back<00:04:37.500> of<00:04:37.770> the<00:04:37.890> cab

00:04:38.150 --> 00:04:38.160 
you took and cut in the back of the cab

00:04:38.160 --> 00:04:40.610 
you took and cut in the back of the cab
off<00:04:38.460> you<00:04:39.210> actually<00:04:39.570> took<00:04:39.720> the<00:04:39.930> spot<00:04:40.200> off<00:04:40.410> of

00:04:40.610 --> 00:04:40.620 
off you actually took the spot off of

00:04:40.620 --> 00:04:43.040 
off you actually took the spot off of
the<00:04:40.740> actuator<00:04:41.370> that<00:04:41.910> the<00:04:42.060> dump<00:04:42.240> box<00:04:42.450> sits<00:04:42.870> on

the actuator that the dump box sits on

00:04:43.050 --> 00:04:46.610 
the actuator that the dump box sits on
when<00:04:43.320> it's<00:04:43.470> closed<00:04:44.060> so<00:04:45.060> you<00:04:45.120> got<00:04:45.300> a<00:04:45.350> I've<00:04:46.350> got

00:04:46.610 --> 00:04:46.620 
when it's closed so you got a I've got

00:04:46.620 --> 00:04:50.000 
when it's closed so you got a I've got
some<00:04:46.830> foam<00:04:47.100> that<00:04:47.880> I<00:04:47.940> stick<00:04:48.240> in<00:04:48.390> there<00:04:48.650> to<00:04:49.650> help

00:04:50.000 --> 00:04:50.010 
some foam that I stick in there to help

00:05:44.870 --> 00:05:44.880 
to make it so that you don't have to put

00:05:44.880 --> 00:05:46.580 
to make it so that you don't have to put
screws<00:05:45.240> in<00:05:45.479> it<00:05:45.600> to<00:05:45.810> where<00:05:45.960> you<00:05:46.110> can<00:05:46.229> just<00:05:46.410> pull

00:05:46.580 --> 00:05:46.590 
screws in it to where you can just pull

00:05:46.590 --> 00:05:48.680 
screws in it to where you can just pull
a<00:05:46.620> clip<00:05:46.919> out<00:05:47.130> and<00:05:47.430> pull<00:05:48.240> the<00:05:48.330> battery<00:05:48.630> out

00:05:53.870 --> 00:05:53.880 
easily it still may end up being where

00:05:53.880 --> 00:05:55.690 
easily it still may end up being where
you<00:05:53.940> got<00:05:54.060> to<00:05:54.150> put<00:05:54.270> the<00:05:54.330> screw<00:05:54.570> in<00:05:54.690> it<00:05:54.810> but<00:05:55.050> it's

00:05:55.690 --> 00:05:55.700 
you got to put the screw in it but it's

00:05:55.700 --> 00:05:58.130 
you got to put the screw in it but it's
two<00:05:56.700> screws<00:05:57.030> to<00:05:57.060> take<00:05:57.419> the<00:05:57.540> battery<00:05:57.870> out<00:05:57.900> which

two screws to take the battery out which

00:05:58.140 --> 00:06:01.090 
two screws to take the battery out which
isn't<00:05:58.320> too<00:05:58.560> bad
