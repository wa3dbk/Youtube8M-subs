00:00:55.160 --> 00:00:55.170 
here during the day I always like to get

00:00:55.170 --> 00:00:57.650 
here during the day I always like to get
here<00:00:55.699> first<00:00:56.699> like<00:00:56.969> that's<00:00:57.270> when<00:00:57.390> they<00:00:57.449> feed

00:00:57.650 --> 00:00:57.660 
here first like that's when they feed

00:00:57.660 --> 00:01:03.439 
here first like that's when they feed
the<00:00:57.780> hardest<00:01:01.489> with<00:01:02.489> crows<00:01:02.760> you<00:01:02.910> always<00:01:03.090> want<00:01:03.270> a

00:01:03.439 --> 00:01:03.449 
the hardest with crows you always want a

00:01:03.449 --> 00:01:07.520 
the hardest with crows you always want a
big<00:01:03.690> pattern<00:01:04.049> I<00:01:04.229> think<00:01:06.020> it<00:01:07.020> gets<00:01:07.200> gives<00:01:07.439> them

00:01:07.520 --> 00:01:07.530 
big pattern I think it gets gives them

00:01:07.530 --> 00:01:09.440 
big pattern I think it gets gives them
more<00:01:07.650> confidence<00:01:07.860> and<00:01:08.490> we've<00:01:08.640> got<00:01:08.820> a<00:01:08.850> just<00:01:09.390> a

00:01:09.440 --> 00:01:09.450 
more confidence and we've got a just a

00:01:09.450 --> 00:01:12.170 
more confidence and we've got a just a
very<00:01:09.630> natural<00:01:09.780> hide<00:01:10.140> here<00:01:10.380> made<00:01:10.590> of<00:01:10.939> one<00:01:11.939> large
