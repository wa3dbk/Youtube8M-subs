this is a James Malone from arses and
previous<00:00:06.870> lesson<00:00:07.109> we<00:00:07.140> just<00:00:07.350> talked<00:00:07.560> about

00:00:07.639 --> 00:00:07.649 
previous lesson we just talked about

00:00:07.649 --> 00:00:10.250 
previous lesson we just talked about
tapping<00:00:08.370> some<00:00:08.639> scales<00:00:09.000> and<00:00:09.360> in<00:00:09.870> this<00:00:10.050> lesson

00:00:10.250 --> 00:00:10.260 
tapping some scales and in this lesson

00:00:10.260 --> 00:00:13.100 
tapping some scales and in this lesson
I'd<00:00:10.559> like<00:00:10.769> to<00:00:10.920> get<00:00:11.340> into<00:00:11.550> the<00:00:12.330> idea<00:00:12.420> of<00:00:12.630> tapping

00:00:13.100 --> 00:00:13.110 
I'd like to get into the idea of tapping

00:00:13.110 --> 00:00:16.519 
I'd like to get into the idea of tapping
arpeggios<00:00:13.710> so<00:00:14.700> um<00:00:15.030> as<00:00:15.420> I<00:00:16.109> said<00:00:16.139> you<00:00:16.410> know

00:00:16.519 --> 00:00:16.529 
arpeggios so um as I said you know

00:00:16.529 --> 00:00:18.470 
arpeggios so um as I said you know
tapping<00:00:16.949> was<00:00:17.070> something<00:00:17.340> I<00:00:17.430> kind<00:00:18.330> of<00:00:18.359> its

00:00:18.470 --> 00:00:18.480 
tapping was something I kind of its

00:00:18.480 --> 00:00:20.810 
tapping was something I kind of its
Eldad<00:00:18.810> a<00:00:18.869> little<00:00:19.230> bit<00:00:19.350> early<00:00:20.010> on<00:00:20.160> cool<00:00:20.670> thing

00:00:20.810 --> 00:00:20.820 
Eldad a little bit early on cool thing

00:00:20.820 --> 00:00:23.359 
Eldad a little bit early on cool thing
about<00:00:21.080> the<00:00:22.080> way<00:00:22.199> I<00:00:22.230> choose<00:00:22.500> to<00:00:22.560> do<00:00:23.100> tapped

00:00:23.359 --> 00:00:23.369 
about the way I choose to do tapped

00:00:23.369 --> 00:00:26.630 
about the way I choose to do tapped
arpeggios<00:00:23.970> is<00:00:24.240> that<00:00:24.449> um<00:00:24.689> unusual<00:00:25.250> like<00:00:26.250> sweet

00:00:26.630 --> 00:00:26.640 
arpeggios is that um unusual like sweet

00:00:26.640 --> 00:00:28.700 
arpeggios is that um unusual like sweet
picking<00:00:27.000> like<00:00:27.599> the<00:00:27.720> most<00:00:27.900> common<00:00:28.260> pattern<00:00:28.560> the

00:00:28.700 --> 00:00:28.710 
picking like the most common pattern the

00:00:28.710 --> 00:00:30.710 
picking like the most common pattern the
one<00:00:28.800> I<00:00:28.859> use<00:00:29.070> the<00:00:29.220> most<00:00:29.340> anyway<00:00:29.760> is<00:00:29.939> uh<00:00:29.970> you<00:00:30.689> know

00:00:30.710 --> 00:00:30.720 
one I use the most anyway is uh you know

00:00:30.720 --> 00:00:34.880 
one I use the most anyway is uh you know
just<00:00:30.960> as<00:00:31.080> five<00:00:31.320> string<00:00:31.590> sweep<00:00:31.830> here<00:00:33.649> now<00:00:34.649> it

00:00:34.880 --> 00:00:34.890 
just as five string sweep here now it

00:00:34.890 --> 00:00:37.790 
just as five string sweep here now it
only<00:00:35.280> really<00:00:35.700> covers<00:00:36.120> like<00:00:36.420> an<00:00:36.690> octave<00:00:37.230> and<00:00:37.500> a

00:00:37.790 --> 00:00:37.800 
only really covers like an octave and a

00:00:37.800 --> 00:00:42.110 
only really covers like an octave and a
half<00:00:38.100> maybe<00:00:38.550> it's<00:00:38.879> you<00:00:39.059> know<00:00:39.180> not<00:00:39.480> like<00:00:41.120> it's

00:00:42.110 --> 00:00:42.120 
half maybe it's you know not like it's

00:00:42.120 --> 00:00:44.869 
half maybe it's you know not like it's
not<00:00:42.239> even<00:00:42.420> a<00:00:42.450> full<00:00:42.510> two<00:00:42.870> octaves<00:00:43.379> so<00:00:44.070> the<00:00:44.730> cool

00:00:44.869 --> 00:00:44.879 
not even a full two octaves so the cool

00:00:44.879 --> 00:00:46.459 
not even a full two octaves so the cool
thing<00:00:45.030> about<00:00:45.090> the<00:00:45.329> other<00:00:45.480> tapped<00:00:45.870> arpeggios

00:00:46.459 --> 00:00:46.469 
thing about the other tapped arpeggios

00:00:46.469 --> 00:00:49.040 
thing about the other tapped arpeggios
is<00:00:46.770> um<00:00:47.039> and<00:00:47.399> I<00:00:48.149> don't<00:00:48.360> know<00:00:48.539> a<00:00:48.570> good<00:00:48.809> way<00:00:48.989> to

00:00:49.040 --> 00:00:49.050 
is um and I don't know a good way to

00:00:49.050 --> 00:00:53.270 
is um and I don't know a good way to
sweep<00:00:49.680> like<00:00:51.110> you<00:00:52.110> know<00:00:52.230> any<00:00:52.620> more<00:00:52.829> than<00:00:52.890> I

00:00:53.270 --> 00:00:53.280 
sweep like you know any more than I

00:00:53.280 --> 00:00:55.100 
sweep like you know any more than I
think<00:00:53.520> you<00:00:53.789> know<00:00:53.879> people<00:00:54.149> can<00:00:54.329> realistically

00:00:55.100 --> 00:00:55.110 
think you know people can realistically

00:00:55.110 --> 00:00:57.860 
think you know people can realistically
like<00:00:55.620> sweep<00:00:55.920> pick<00:00:56.160> like<00:00:56.480> two<00:00:57.480> octave

00:00:57.860 --> 00:00:57.870 
like sweep pick like two octave

00:00:57.870 --> 00:01:00.830 
like sweep pick like two octave
arpeggios<00:00:58.410> but<00:00:59.309> um<00:00:59.579> any<00:01:00.390> more<00:01:00.600> than<00:01:00.719> that's

00:01:00.830 --> 00:01:00.840 
arpeggios but um any more than that's

00:01:00.840 --> 00:01:03.860 
arpeggios but um any more than that's
really<00:01:01.289> probably<00:01:01.890> not<00:01:01.980> going<00:01:02.100> to<00:01:02.190> happen<00:01:02.870> but

00:01:03.860 --> 00:01:03.870 
really probably not going to happen but

00:01:03.870 --> 00:01:06.200 
really probably not going to happen but
with<00:01:04.049> tapping<00:01:04.439> arpeggios<00:01:04.920> however<00:01:05.189> a<00:01:05.309> found<00:01:06.150> a

00:01:06.200 --> 00:01:06.210 
with tapping arpeggios however a found a

00:01:06.210 --> 00:01:08.120 
with tapping arpeggios however a found a
way<00:01:06.330> to<00:01:06.390> get<00:01:06.600> like<00:01:06.720> a<00:01:06.750> full<00:01:07.049> three<00:01:07.860> octave

00:01:08.120 --> 00:01:08.130 
way to get like a full three octave

00:01:08.130 --> 00:01:10.609 
way to get like a full three octave
arpeggio<00:01:08.610> in<00:01:08.760> and<00:01:09.420> we're<00:01:09.630> gonna<00:01:09.720> illustrate

00:01:10.609 --> 00:01:10.619 
arpeggio in and we're gonna illustrate

00:01:10.619 --> 00:01:12.950 
arpeggio in and we're gonna illustrate
this<00:01:11.010> in<00:01:11.250> the<00:01:11.369> key<00:01:11.729> of<00:01:11.760> C<00:01:12.119> we<00:01:12.540> already<00:01:12.659> talked

00:01:12.950 --> 00:01:12.960 
this in the key of C we already talked

00:01:12.960 --> 00:01:16.490 
this in the key of C we already talked
about<00:01:13.430> and<00:01:14.430> uh<00:01:14.760> Accords<00:01:15.750> again<00:01:15.960> in<00:01:16.170> the<00:01:16.259> key<00:01:16.409> of

00:01:16.490 --> 00:01:16.500 
about and uh Accords again in the key of

00:01:16.500 --> 00:01:18.530 
about and uh Accords again in the key of
C<00:01:16.650> are<00:01:16.860> going<00:01:16.979> to<00:01:17.040> be<00:01:17.130> C<00:01:17.340> major<00:01:17.490> you<00:01:18.240> know<00:01:18.330> we've

00:01:18.530 --> 00:01:18.540 
C are going to be C major you know we've

00:01:18.540 --> 00:01:20.510 
C are going to be C major you know we've
all<00:01:18.689> listened<00:01:19.470> to<00:01:19.530> eddie<00:01:19.650> van<00:01:19.860> halen<00:01:19.890> i'm<00:01:20.340> sure

00:01:20.510 --> 00:01:20.520 
all listened to eddie van halen i'm sure

00:01:20.520 --> 00:01:22.520 
all listened to eddie van halen i'm sure
you<00:01:20.790> know<00:01:20.909> he<00:01:21.060> used<00:01:21.240> similar<00:01:21.750> pitch<00:01:21.960> shows<00:01:22.229> all

00:01:22.520 --> 00:01:22.530 
you know he used similar pitch shows all

00:01:22.530 --> 00:01:24.920 
you know he used similar pitch shows all
the<00:01:22.650> time

00:01:24.920 --> 00:01:24.930 

00:01:24.930 --> 00:01:26.960 

you<00:01:25.470> know<00:01:25.560> just<00:01:25.770> like<00:01:25.890> that<00:01:26.130> well<00:01:26.340> not<00:01:26.490> why<00:01:26.940> not

00:01:26.960 --> 00:01:26.970 
you know just like that well not why not

00:01:26.970 --> 00:01:28.520 
you know just like that well not why not
move<00:01:27.240> them<00:01:27.450> around<00:01:27.570> into<00:01:27.870> different<00:01:28.170> octaves

00:01:28.520 --> 00:01:28.530 
move them around into different octaves

00:01:28.530 --> 00:01:31.730 
move them around into different octaves
so<00:01:28.800> I<00:01:28.890> have<00:01:29.780> C<00:01:30.780> major<00:01:30.930> here<00:01:31.200> starting<00:01:31.530> on<00:01:31.620> the<00:01:31.710> E

00:01:31.730 --> 00:01:31.740 
so I have C major here starting on the E

00:01:31.740 --> 00:01:34.490 
so I have C major here starting on the E
string<00:01:31.860> with<00:01:32.340> the<00:01:32.460> eighth<00:01:33.000> fret<00:01:33.300> I'm<00:01:34.230> on<00:01:34.410> the

00:01:34.490 --> 00:01:34.500 
string with the eighth fret I'm on the

00:01:34.500 --> 00:01:40.790 
string with the eighth fret I'm on the
twelve<00:01:36.320> tap<00:01:37.320> the<00:01:37.470> G<00:01:38.780> now<00:01:39.780> much<00:01:39.990> like<00:01:40.230> with<00:01:40.500> the

00:01:40.790 --> 00:01:40.800 
twelve tap the G now much like with the

00:01:40.800 --> 00:01:45.000 
twelve tap the G now much like with the
scalar<00:01:41.160> tapping<00:01:41.580> I<00:01:41.640> was<00:01:41.760> doing<00:01:42.060> where<00:01:42.210> you

00:01:45.000 --> 00:01:45.010 

00:01:45.010 --> 00:01:47.620 

and<00:01:46.010> have<00:01:46.220> to<00:01:46.310> hand<00:01:46.490> on<00:01:46.610> the<00:01:46.700> note<00:01:46.850> same<00:01:47.479> thing

00:01:47.620 --> 00:01:47.630 
and have to hand on the note same thing

00:01:47.630 --> 00:01:49.690 
and have to hand on the note same thing
really<00:01:47.810> applies<00:01:48.049> to<00:01:48.080> these<00:01:48.320> arpeggios<00:01:48.580> so<00:01:49.580> we

00:01:49.690 --> 00:01:49.700 
really applies to these arpeggios so we

00:01:49.700 --> 00:01:55.630 
really applies to these arpeggios so we
have<00:01:49.939> e<00:01:50.799> on<00:01:51.799> c<00:01:52.369> e<00:01:52.610> and<00:01:52.880> g<00:01:53.170> then<00:01:54.170> when<00:01:55.159> we<00:01:55.280> do<00:01:55.520> it

00:01:55.630 --> 00:01:55.640 
have e on c e and g then when we do it

00:01:55.640 --> 00:01:58.539 
have e on c e and g then when we do it
the<00:01:55.700> next<00:01:55.909> octave<00:01:56.299> up<00:01:57.220> we're<00:01:58.220> going<00:01:58.340> to<00:01:58.399> want

00:01:58.539 --> 00:01:58.549 
the next octave up we're going to want

00:01:58.549 --> 00:02:00.570 
the next octave up we're going to want
to<00:01:58.580> hammer<00:01:58.729> on<00:01:58.909> the<00:01:59.030> C

00:02:00.570 --> 00:02:00.580 
to hammer on the C

00:02:00.580 --> 00:02:03.360 
to hammer on the C
so<00:02:01.210> again<00:02:01.780> practice<00:02:02.170> your<00:02:02.290> legato<00:02:02.680> exercises

00:02:03.360 --> 00:02:03.370 
so again practice your legato exercises

00:02:03.370 --> 00:02:05.550 
so again practice your legato exercises
to<00:02:03.550> get<00:02:03.910> some<00:02:04.090> left<00:02:04.300> hand<00:02:04.510> strength<00:02:04.810> so<00:02:05.440> we

00:02:05.550 --> 00:02:05.560 
to get some left hand strength so we

00:02:05.560 --> 00:02:13.490 
to get some left hand strength so we
have<00:02:06.120> C<00:02:07.120> D<00:02:07.450> G<00:02:08.040> C<00:02:09.040> D<00:02:09.369> G<00:02:09.970> C<00:02:10.270> D<00:02:10.479> G

00:02:13.490 --> 00:02:13.500 

00:02:13.500 --> 00:02:25.910 

like<00:02:14.500> slow<00:02:14.710> let<00:02:14.830> me<00:02:14.920> do<00:02:15.010> that<00:02:15.160> one<00:02:15.400> more<00:02:15.670> time

00:02:25.910 --> 00:02:25.920 

00:02:25.920 --> 00:02:27.860 

if<00:02:26.670> we<00:02:26.790> just<00:02:26.970> move<00:02:27.090> those<00:02:27.330> around<00:02:27.569> till<00:02:27.810> all

00:02:27.860 --> 00:02:27.870 
if we just move those around till all

00:02:27.870 --> 00:02:30.170 
if we just move those around till all
the<00:02:27.960> diatonic<00:02:28.380> arpeggios<00:02:28.980> for<00:02:29.250> this<00:02:29.370> key<00:02:29.580> we'd

00:02:30.170 --> 00:02:30.180 
the diatonic arpeggios for this key we'd

00:02:30.180 --> 00:02:54.410 
the diatonic arpeggios for this key we'd
have<00:02:30.300> something<00:02:30.480> like<00:02:30.720> this

00:02:54.410 --> 00:02:54.420 

00:02:54.420 --> 00:02:57.210 

so<00:02:55.420> that's<00:02:55.660> so<00:02:55.870> full<00:02:56.140> three<00:02:56.410> octave<00:02:56.680> arpeggios

00:02:57.210 --> 00:02:57.220 
so that's so full three octave arpeggios

00:02:57.220 --> 00:03:00.990 
so that's so full three octave arpeggios
all<00:02:57.910> around<00:02:58.480> the<00:02:58.540> key<00:02:59.370> playthrough<00:03:00.370> really

00:03:00.990 --> 00:03:01.000 
all around the key playthrough really

00:03:01.000 --> 00:03:02.880 
all around the key playthrough really
really<00:03:01.210> slow<00:03:01.420> for<00:03:01.630> you<00:03:01.720> one<00:03:01.870> time<00:03:02.110> it's<00:03:02.620> really

00:03:02.880 --> 00:03:02.890 
really slow for you one time it's really

00:03:02.890 --> 00:03:04.980 
really slow for you one time it's really
kind<00:03:03.070> of<00:03:03.100> hard<00:03:03.310> with<00:03:03.520> sweet<00:03:03.760> picking<00:03:04.150> or<00:03:04.360> you

00:03:04.980 --> 00:03:04.990 
kind of hard with sweet picking or you

00:03:04.990 --> 00:03:07.199 
kind of hard with sweet picking or you
know<00:03:05.080> alternate<00:03:05.500> picking<00:03:05.910> arpeggios<00:03:06.910> to<00:03:07.090> get

00:03:07.199 --> 00:03:07.209 
know alternate picking arpeggios to get

00:03:07.209 --> 00:03:10.620 
know alternate picking arpeggios to get
like<00:03:07.390> really<00:03:07.780> cool<00:03:08.050> patterns<00:03:08.590> so<00:03:09.310> I<00:03:09.850> you<00:03:10.570> know

00:03:10.620 --> 00:03:10.630 
like really cool patterns so I you know

00:03:10.630 --> 00:03:12.449 
like really cool patterns so I you know
discovered<00:03:11.170> that<00:03:11.350> the<00:03:11.680> sequences<00:03:12.190> I<00:03:12.310> was

00:03:12.449 --> 00:03:12.459 
discovered that the sequences I was

00:03:12.459 --> 00:03:14.460 
discovered that the sequences I was
doing<00:03:12.730> with<00:03:12.880> my<00:03:12.910> picking<00:03:13.450> I<00:03:13.660> could<00:03:14.140> apply<00:03:14.380> to

00:03:14.460 --> 00:03:14.470 
doing with my picking I could apply to

00:03:14.470 --> 00:03:17.370 
doing with my picking I could apply to
these<00:03:14.680> arpeggios<00:03:15.280> with<00:03:15.730> the<00:03:16.150> tapping<00:03:16.570> so<00:03:17.260> if

00:03:17.370 --> 00:03:17.380 
these arpeggios with the tapping so if

00:03:17.380 --> 00:03:19.170 
these arpeggios with the tapping so if
you'll<00:03:17.740> recall<00:03:17.920> we<00:03:18.280> had<00:03:18.430> that<00:03:18.550> one<00:03:18.730> exercise

00:03:19.170 --> 00:03:19.180 
you'll recall we had that one exercise

00:03:19.180 --> 00:03:26.480 
you'll recall we had that one exercise
in<00:03:19.360> the<00:03:19.450> last<00:03:19.660> lesson

00:03:26.480 --> 00:03:26.490 

00:03:26.490 --> 00:03:28.610 

and<00:03:26.670> this<00:03:27.150> can<00:03:27.330> easily<00:03:27.540> be<00:03:28.110> applied<00:03:28.200> to<00:03:28.500> these

00:03:28.610 --> 00:03:28.620 
and this can easily be applied to these

00:03:28.620 --> 00:03:36.509 
and this can easily be applied to these
arpeggios

00:03:36.509 --> 00:03:36.519 

00:03:36.519 --> 00:03:39.520 

pretty<00:03:37.519> cool<00:03:37.700> little<00:03:38.120> arpeggiated<00:03:39.110> lick<00:03:39.290> that

00:03:39.520 --> 00:03:39.530 
pretty cool little arpeggiated lick that

00:03:39.530 --> 00:03:42.009 
pretty cool little arpeggiated lick that
you<00:03:39.739> wouldn't<00:03:40.730> ordinarily<00:03:40.879> do<00:03:41.269> with<00:03:41.510> a<00:03:41.540> sweet

00:03:42.009 --> 00:03:42.019 
you wouldn't ordinarily do with a sweet

00:03:42.019 --> 00:03:43.690 
you wouldn't ordinarily do with a sweet
picking<00:03:42.290> or<00:03:42.409> alternate<00:03:42.739> picking<00:03:42.920> really<00:03:43.280> so

00:03:43.690 --> 00:03:43.700 
picking or alternate picking really so

00:03:43.700 --> 00:03:45.849 
picking or alternate picking really so
these<00:03:43.819> are<00:03:43.969> like<00:03:44.420> just<00:03:44.689> a<00:03:44.780> couple<00:03:45.079> ideas<00:03:45.230> for

00:03:45.849 --> 00:03:45.859 
these are like just a couple ideas for

00:03:45.859 --> 00:03:47.559 
these are like just a couple ideas for
you<00:03:46.519> know<00:03:46.640> practicing<00:03:47.180> these<00:03:47.299> tapped

00:03:47.559 --> 00:03:47.569 
you know practicing these tapped

00:03:47.569 --> 00:03:49.059 
you know practicing these tapped
arpeggios<00:03:48.140> if<00:03:48.349> you<00:03:48.439> just<00:03:48.620> don't<00:03:48.769> want<00:03:48.890> to<00:03:48.950> do

00:03:49.059 --> 00:03:49.069 
arpeggios if you just don't want to do

00:03:49.069 --> 00:03:50.830 
arpeggios if you just don't want to do
them<00:03:49.250> straight<00:03:49.849> up<00:03:50.030> and<00:03:50.180> down<00:03:50.239> kind<00:03:50.629> of<00:03:50.659> break

00:03:50.830 --> 00:03:50.840 
them straight up and down kind of break

00:03:50.840 --> 00:03:53.289 
them straight up and down kind of break
it<00:03:50.870> up<00:03:51.079> break<00:03:51.290> up<00:03:51.439> the<00:03:51.560> monotony<00:03:51.829> and<00:03:52.299> you

00:03:53.289 --> 00:03:53.299 
it up break up the monotony and you

00:03:53.299 --> 00:03:55.589 
it up break up the monotony and you
cannot<00:03:53.540> do<00:03:53.780> some<00:03:53.930> cool<00:03:54.140> cool<00:03:54.769> phrasing<00:03:55.280> in<00:03:55.400> it

00:03:55.589 --> 00:03:55.599 
cannot do some cool cool phrasing in it

00:03:55.599 --> 00:03:57.399 
cannot do some cool cool phrasing in it
there<00:03:56.599> you<00:03:56.689> have<00:03:56.840> it

00:03:57.399 --> 00:03:57.409 
there you have it

00:03:57.409 --> 00:04:00.039 
there you have it
capped<00:03:57.950> arpeggios<00:03:58.489> and<00:03:58.790> a<00:03:59.090> place<00:03:59.750> you<00:03:59.900> can<00:04:00.019> use

00:04:00.039 --> 00:04:00.049 
capped arpeggios and a place you can use

00:04:00.049 --> 00:04:11.400 
capped arpeggios and a place you can use
them

00:04:11.400 --> 00:04:11.410 

00:04:11.410 --> 00:04:13.470
