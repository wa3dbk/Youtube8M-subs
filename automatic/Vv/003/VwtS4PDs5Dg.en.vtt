00:02:26.450 --> 00:02:26.460 
know that's just built into the TV so

00:02:26.460 --> 00:02:29.510 
know that's just built into the TV so
it's<00:02:26.490> kind<00:02:26.940> of<00:02:27.000> like<00:02:27.120> a<00:02:27.180> win-win<00:02:27.360> for<00:02:27.540> that<00:02:28.520> the

00:02:29.510 --> 00:02:29.520 
it's kind of like a win-win for that the

00:02:29.520 --> 00:02:31.490 
it's kind of like a win-win for that the
remote<00:02:29.790> is<00:02:29.910> also<00:02:30.180> back<00:02:30.480> foot<00:02:30.720> it<00:02:31.200> is<00:02:31.290> not<00:02:31.470> my

00:02:31.490 --> 00:02:31.500 
remote is also back foot it is not my

00:02:31.500 --> 00:02:34.970 
remote is also back foot it is not my
primary<00:02:31.890> remote<00:02:32.250> because<00:02:33.500> unfortunately<00:02:34.500> you

00:02:34.970 --> 00:02:34.980 
primary remote because unfortunately you

00:02:34.980 --> 00:02:40.190 
primary remote because unfortunately you
know<00:02:35.100> TiVo<00:02:35.790> does<00:02:36.060> not<00:02:36.240> support<00:02:38.690> Viera<00:02:39.690> link<00:02:39.870> at

this<00:02:40.410> time<00:02:40.620> so<00:02:40.890> I<00:02:40.920> mean<00:02:41.130> it's<00:02:41.700> kind<00:02:41.850> of<00:02:41.880> a

00:02:41.960 --> 00:02:41.970 
this time so I mean it's kind of a

00:02:41.970 --> 00:02:43.550 
this time so I mean it's kind of a
disadvantage<00:02:42.630> because<00:02:42.660> it<00:02:43.200> would<00:02:43.290> be<00:02:43.350> nice

00:02:43.550 --> 00:02:43.560 
disadvantage because it would be nice

00:02:43.560 --> 00:02:46.130 
disadvantage because it would be nice
it'd<00:02:44.250> be<00:02:44.400> terrific<00:02:44.640> feature<00:02:45.060> to<00:02:45.240> have<00:02:45.360> if<00:02:45.600> this
