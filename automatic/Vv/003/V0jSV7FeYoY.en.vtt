00:00:06.529 --> 00:00:09.719
 Ranks almost nothing android a year 

00:00:09.299 --> 00:00:11.730
 told 

00:00:09.719 --> 00:00:13.740
 from lina at the mobile world congress 

00:00:11.730 --> 00:00:17.369
 the top 5 are at the stand of the high 

00:00:13.740 --> 00:00:19.680
 tempo device seen from medion media 

00:00:17.369 --> 00:00:21.240
 As you know, there is an under label of 

00:00:19.680 --> 00:00:22.230
 Lenovo a company at some point 

00:00:21.240 --> 00:00:24.509
 was bought up 

00:00:22.230 --> 00:00:27.720
 and here in hand I hold a 10 

00:00:24.509 --> 00:00:29.669
 inches the medion lifetab it sounds 10 345 

00:00:27.720 --> 00:00:30.899
 a bit like a zip code though 

00:00:29.669 --> 00:00:34.350
 of course, it's already in the name 

00:00:30.899 --> 00:00:37.200
 that the 1 10 inch is on it runs 

00:00:34.350 --> 00:00:39.870
 still android 4.4 kitkat is doing so far 

00:00:37.200 --> 00:00:41.190
 Of course there is nothing like 10,444 kitkat 

00:00:39.870 --> 00:00:43.609
 a good android version 

00:00:41.190 --> 00:00:47.269
 Let's take a short look at this setting 

00:00:43.609 --> 00:00:52.159
 that reacts a bit slow now 

00:00:47.269 --> 00:00:55.589
 you see four point 4.4 

00:00:52.159 --> 00:00:57.089
 the 10 inch is characterized by the 

00:00:55.589 --> 00:00:58.739
 one that we series here 

00:00:57.089 --> 00:01:00.300
 front speakers so who like 

00:00:58.739 --> 00:01:02.579
 on my tray my movie cop or 

00:01:00.300 --> 00:01:04.440
 this is just a couple of games 

00:01:02.579 --> 00:01:06.210
 certainly the most suitable 

00:01:04.440 --> 00:01:07.260
 margins are relatively wide but that must 

00:01:06.210 --> 00:01:08.820
 yes not necessarily something bad 

00:01:07.260 --> 00:01:11.450
 so you have in any case always one 

00:01:08.820 --> 00:01:13.830
 little storage space for the hands 

00:01:11.450 --> 00:01:16.290
 the whole device has one 

00:01:13.830 --> 00:01:17.940
 metal case so that's tiles here 

00:01:16.290 --> 00:01:19.710
 that is of course plastic because of 

00:01:17.940 --> 00:01:23.090
 connectivity but really a bit 

00:01:19.710 --> 00:01:25.110
 This is metal here 

00:01:23.090 --> 00:01:27.210
 marks that means we stay too 

00:01:25.110 --> 00:01:29.210
 No fingerprints back feels 

00:01:27.210 --> 00:01:31.860
 really good to me too very very easily 

00:01:29.210 --> 00:01:34.050
 the button goal we have the power 

00:01:31.860 --> 00:01:35.430
 button here we have something narrow 

00:01:34.050 --> 00:01:38.460
 volume-rocker here is even a 

00:01:35.430 --> 00:01:41.190
 radio out this is the micro usb one and 

00:01:38.460 --> 00:01:43.800
 Exit here and here we believe 

00:01:41.190 --> 00:01:46.800
 I still could not have a micro sd 

00:01:43.800 --> 00:01:48.300
 slot cards are on the other side 

00:01:46.800 --> 00:01:50.130
 we have nothing else now is yes 

00:01:48.300 --> 00:01:52.530
 clearly the speakers are on the front 

00:01:50.130 --> 00:01:55.440
 made a good impression that I easily 

00:01:52.530 --> 00:01:57.840
 in hand specifications still briefly there 

00:01:55.440 --> 00:02:00.750
 is an Intel Atom processor in there 73 

00:01:57.840 --> 00:02:03.420
 35 it clocks that's mine 

00:02:00.750 --> 00:02:05.970
 tractor of tactics up to 1 83 ghz 

00:02:03.420 --> 00:02:08.190
 we have a total of 32 gb here 

00:02:05.970 --> 00:02:09.300
 internal memory in it is also 

00:02:08.190 --> 00:02:11.459
 ever have a great thing here 

00:02:09.300 --> 00:02:14.159
 we have a two megapixel front camera on 

00:02:11.459 --> 00:02:15.030
 the back side is a 5 megapixel 

00:02:14.159 --> 00:02:17.609
 camera 

00:02:15.030 --> 00:02:20.010
 The device also has GPS and an I 

00:02:17.609 --> 00:02:21.599
 say head with 9000 battery 

00:02:20.010 --> 00:02:24.120
 Milliahs there you come 

00:02:21.599 --> 00:02:26.819

00:02:24.120 --> 00:02:30.230

00:02:26.819 --> 00:02:34.739
