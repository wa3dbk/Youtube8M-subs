you just sort of stay steadfast so
that's<00:05:49.830> probably<00:05:50.040> the<00:05:50.280> biggest<00:05:51.470> obstacle<00:05:52.470> is

00:05:52.640 --> 00:05:52.650 
that's probably the biggest obstacle is

00:05:52.650 --> 00:05:55.430 
that's probably the biggest obstacle is
just<00:05:52.950> being<00:05:53.850> represented<00:05:54.450> properly<00:05:54.690> but<00:05:55.290> I<00:05:55.350> do

00:05:55.430 --> 00:05:55.440 
just being represented properly but I do

00:05:55.440 --> 00:05:56.750 
just being represented properly but I do
think<00:05:55.710> we're<00:05:55.890> making<00:05:56.160> strides<00:05:56.430> in<00:05:56.730> that

00:05:56.750 --> 00:05:56.760 
think we're making strides in that

00:05:56.760 --> 00:05:59.180 
think we're making strides in that
direction<00:05:57.030> and<00:05:57.630> do<00:05:58.110> you<00:05:58.230> get<00:05:58.410> to<00:05:58.620> audition<00:05:58.770> for

00:05:59.180 --> 00:05:59.190 
direction and do you get to audition for

00:05:59.190 --> 00:06:02.120 
direction and do you get to audition for
a<00:05:59.400> lot<00:05:59.640> of<00:05:59.670> Filipino<00:06:00.510> roles<00:06:00.810> at<00:06:01.170> all<00:06:01.560> not

00:06:02.120 --> 00:06:02.130 
a lot of Filipino roles at all not

00:06:02.130 --> 00:06:04.130 
a lot of Filipino roles at all not
really<00:06:02.460> there's<00:06:02.640> not<00:06:02.760> a<00:06:02.940> ton<00:06:03.330> but<00:06:03.360> there<00:06:03.930> are<00:06:04.110> a

00:06:04.130 --> 00:06:04.140 
really there's not a ton but there are a

00:06:04.140 --> 00:06:07.040 
really there's not a ton but there are a
lot<00:06:04.410> of<00:06:04.950> roles<00:06:05.460> where<00:06:05.940> they<00:06:06.270> ask<00:06:06.660> for

00:06:07.040 --> 00:06:07.050 
lot of roles where they ask for

00:06:07.050 --> 00:06:11.240 
lot of roles where they ask for
multicultural<00:06:07.920> type<00:06:08.750> women<00:06:09.750> and<00:06:10.260> then<00:06:10.680> so

00:06:11.240 --> 00:06:11.250 
multicultural type women and then so

00:06:11.250 --> 00:06:12.620 
multicultural type women and then so
when<00:06:11.460> you<00:06:11.580> tell<00:06:11.790> them<00:06:11.910> they're<00:06:12.090> filipino<00:06:12.480> then

00:06:12.620 --> 00:06:12.630 
when you tell them they're filipino then

00:06:12.630 --> 00:06:13.910 
when you tell them they're filipino then
maybe<00:06:12.810> they'll<00:06:13.020> write<00:06:13.200> it<00:06:13.320> into<00:06:13.560> the<00:06:13.680> script

00:06:13.910 --> 00:06:13.920 
maybe they'll write it into the script

00:06:13.920 --> 00:06:16.010 
maybe they'll write it into the script
or<00:06:14.130> it's<00:06:14.250> just<00:06:14.310> an<00:06:14.550> aspect<00:06:14.910> that<00:06:15.120> i<00:06:15.210> think<00:06:15.330> goes

00:06:16.010 --> 00:06:16.020
