attempt things are a little bleak now
it's<00:00:42.930> about<00:00:43.110> survival<00:00:43.680> you'll<00:00:44.160> need<00:00:44.340> to<00:00:44.520> make

00:00:44.630 --> 00:00:44.640 
it's about survival you'll need to make

00:00:44.640 --> 00:00:46.700 
it's about survival you'll need to make
stealth<00:00:45.000> speed<00:00:45.360> and<00:00:45.629> firepower<00:00:45.930> to<00:00:46.410> pull<00:00:46.590> this

00:00:46.700 --> 00:00:46.710 
stealth speed and firepower to pull this

00:00:46.710 --> 00:00:48.889 
stealth speed and firepower to pull this
off<00:00:46.890> I<00:00:47.190> suggest<00:00:47.700> taking<00:00:48.059> mechs<00:00:48.450> in<00:00:48.629> the<00:00:48.719> heavy

00:00:48.889 --> 00:00:48.899 
off I suggest taking mechs in the heavy

00:00:48.899 --> 00:00:50.450 
off I suggest taking mechs in the heavy
range<00:00:49.170> with<00:00:49.440> ECM<00:00:49.920> mounted

00:00:50.450 --> 00:00:50.460

we're<00:00:50.850> going<00:00:51.090> in<00:00:51.180> covertly<00:00:51.539> about<00:00:52.020> a

00:00:52.040 --> 00:00:52.050 
we're going in covertly about a

00:00:52.050 --> 00:00:54.139 
we're going in covertly about a
commercial<00:00:52.379> dropship<00:00:52.949> will<00:00:53.520> be<00:00:53.640> limited<00:00:54.030> in

00:00:54.139 --> 00:00:54.149 
commercial dropship will be limited in

00:00:54.149 --> 00:00:56.770 
commercial dropship will be limited in
land<00:00:54.360> size<00:00:54.600> and<00:00:54.840> weight<00:00:54.989> good<00:00:55.739> luck<00:00:55.920> commander

00:00:56.770 --> 00:00:56.780 
land size and weight good luck commander

00:00:56.780 --> 00:00:59.869 
land size and weight good luck commander
yeah<00:00:57.780> this<00:00:57.989> is<00:00:58.140> a<00:00:58.649> tricky<00:00:59.070> one<00:00:59.100> I<00:00:59.340> remember<00:00:59.760> it

00:00:59.869 --> 00:00:59.879 
yeah this is a tricky one I remember it

00:00:59.879 --> 00:01:01.700 
yeah this is a tricky one I remember it
well<00:01:00.030> because<00:01:00.270> I<00:01:00.750> have<00:01:00.930> to<00:01:01.050> do<00:01:01.199> it<00:01:01.320> a<00:01:01.379> bunch<00:01:01.530> of

00:01:01.700 --> 00:01:01.710 
well because I have to do it a bunch of

00:01:01.710 --> 00:01:06.289 
well because I have to do it a bunch of
times<00:01:01.770> in<00:01:02.070> the<00:01:02.160> past<00:01:03.019> we<00:01:04.019> will<00:01:04.170> start<00:01:04.470> out<00:01:04.729> in<00:01:05.729> a

00:01:06.289 --> 00:01:06.299 
times in the past we will start out in a

00:01:06.299 --> 00:01:08.780 
times in the past we will start out in a
spaceport<00:01:06.570> and<00:01:07.110> there<00:01:08.100> are<00:01:08.250> turrets<00:01:08.610> all

00:01:08.780 --> 00:01:08.790 
spaceport and there are turrets all

00:01:08.790 --> 00:01:11.420 
spaceport and there are turrets all
around<00:01:09.090> shooting<00:01:09.510> at<00:01:09.600> us<00:01:09.799> at<00:01:10.799> these<00:01:11.010> two<00:01:11.189> nav

00:01:11.420 --> 00:01:11.430 
around shooting at us at these two nav

00:01:11.430 --> 00:01:12.830 
around shooting at us at these two nav
points<00:01:11.820> there<00:01:11.970> are<00:01:12.060> two<00:01:12.180> turret<00:01:12.450> control

00:01:12.830 --> 00:01:12.840 
points there are two turret control

00:01:12.840 --> 00:01:14.890 
points there are two turret control
facilities<00:01:13.320> who<00:01:13.530> need<00:01:13.770> to<00:01:13.890> die<00:01:14.070> within

00:01:14.890 --> 00:01:14.900 
facilities who need to die within

00:01:14.900 --> 00:01:17.929 
facilities who need to die within
probably<00:01:15.900> something<00:01:16.290> like<00:01:16.490> five<00:01:17.490> to<00:01:17.729> ten

00:01:17.929 --> 00:01:17.939 
probably something like five to ten

00:01:17.939 --> 00:01:21.020 
probably something like five to ten
seconds<00:01:18.470> if<00:01:19.470> I<00:01:19.619> can<00:01:19.799> pull<00:01:19.979> that<00:01:20.159> off<00:01:20.220> without

00:01:21.020 --> 00:01:21.030 
seconds if I can pull that off without

00:01:21.030 --> 00:01:23.899 
seconds if I can pull that off without
losing<00:01:21.330> my<00:01:21.540> center<00:01:21.840> torso<00:01:22.369> we<00:01:23.369> have<00:01:23.549> a<00:01:23.580> shot

00:01:23.899 --> 00:01:23.909 
losing my center torso we have a shot

00:01:23.909 --> 00:01:25.609 
losing my center torso we have a shot
it's<00:01:24.210> a<00:01:24.330> very<00:01:24.509> slow<00:01:24.750> machine<00:01:25.140> because<00:01:25.439> then<00:01:25.590> I

00:01:25.609 --> 00:01:25.619 
it's a very slow machine because then I

00:01:25.619 --> 00:01:27.170 
it's a very slow machine because then I
have<00:01:25.770> to<00:01:25.890> walk<00:01:26.070> all<00:01:26.280> the<00:01:26.310> way<00:01:26.400> over<00:01:26.490> here<00:01:26.970> and

00:01:27.170 --> 00:01:27.180 
have to walk all the way over here and

00:01:27.180 --> 00:01:28.850 
have to walk all the way over here and
all<00:01:27.390> the<00:01:27.540> way<00:01:27.630> over<00:01:27.900> there<00:01:28.110> which<00:01:28.380> is<00:01:28.530> a<00:01:28.560> long

00:01:28.850 --> 00:01:28.860 
all the way over there which is a long

00:01:28.860 --> 00:01:33.319 
all the way over there which is a long
way<00:01:29.570> and<00:01:30.570> real<00:01:30.990> slow<00:01:31.259> here<00:01:31.880> comes<00:01:32.880> the<00:01:33.000> final

00:01:33.319 --> 00:01:33.329 
way and real slow here comes the final

00:01:33.329 --> 00:01:36.310 
way and real slow here comes the final
battle<00:01:33.659> there<00:01:34.560> will<00:01:34.680> be<00:01:34.710> I<00:01:35.130> think<00:01:35.310> two<00:01:35.640> Lance's

00:01:36.310 --> 00:01:36.320 
battle there will be I think two Lance's

00:01:36.320 --> 00:01:38.590 
battle there will be I think two Lance's
