00:00:16.289 --> 00:00:26.910
 and we're going to focus on one that is the 

00:00:18.539 --> 00:00:28.500
 which has plants of tropical type is 

00:00:26.910 --> 00:00:30.750
 important to know that there are many 

00:00:28.500 --> 00:00:32.730
 types of gardens a classification by 

00:00:30.750 --> 00:00:34.379
 example is by the type of plants that 

00:00:32.730 --> 00:00:36.450
 let's use and the other one is like that 

00:00:34.379 --> 00:00:41.039
 decorative of the same space of the 

00:00:36.450 --> 00:00:42.750
 architecture for example there are the 

00:00:41.039 --> 00:00:44.520
 gardens mediterranean gardens 

00:00:42.750 --> 00:00:46.320
 minimalist the gardens of roncaglia and 

00:00:44.520 --> 00:00:48.420
 today we are going to focus on one 

00:00:46.320 --> 00:00:50.570
 which are the gardens that have plants 

00:00:48.420 --> 00:00:50.570
 tropical 

00:00:56.920 --> 00:01:00.820
 a characteristic garden plant 

00:00:58.960 --> 00:01:02.739
 tropical are the palm trees that are the 

00:01:00.820 --> 00:01:05.250
 that add breadth and freshness to 

00:01:02.739 --> 00:01:05.250
 our gardens 

00:01:13.780 --> 00:01:17.960
 within the group of palm trees we have 

00:01:16.160 --> 00:01:19.820
 dwarf palm trees like palm trees very 

00:01:17.960 --> 00:01:21.620
 great to remember that the palms 

00:01:19.820 --> 00:01:23.510
 small ones are for indoor use and 

00:01:21.620 --> 00:01:26.380
 large outdoor use is to say in 

00:01:23.510 --> 00:01:26.380
 parks and gardens 

00:01:35.990 --> 00:01:40.530
 a decorative and ideal decorative element 

00:01:39.030 --> 00:01:42.300
 for our spaces are the lucky 

00:01:40.530 --> 00:01:44.400
 bamboo that are bamboo palmer 

00:01:42.300 --> 00:01:47.840
 braided that go very well in our 

00:01:44.400 --> 00:01:47.840
 entrance hall and social areas 

00:01:51.220 --> 00:01:55.450
 another of the plants that we can use 

00:01:53.050 --> 00:01:57.910
 in a tropical garden are the cypresses 

00:01:55.450 --> 00:01:59.680
 candle these are some of the most elegant 

00:01:57.910 --> 00:02:01.600
 thanks to the great hue of greens 

00:01:59.680 --> 00:02:03.790
 intense they have and to the movement that 

00:02:01.600 --> 00:02:05.770
 they are adopting as they grow 

00:02:03.790 --> 00:02:07.920
 Greater elegance to the design of our 

00:02:05.770 --> 00:02:07.920
 gardens 

00:02:13.040 --> 00:02:15.989
 now we show you the coves 

00:02:15.360 --> 00:02:17.730
 yellow 

00:02:15.989 --> 00:02:19.290
 this is a very difficult variety of 

00:02:17.730 --> 00:02:21.090
 find since normally in the 

00:02:19.290 --> 00:02:23.760
 market we will find the coves 

00:02:21.090 --> 00:02:25.920
 white this variety is considered 

00:02:23.760 --> 00:02:28.340
 exotic due to the strange yellow color 

00:02:25.920 --> 00:02:28.340
 what has 

00:02:31.720 --> 00:02:35.380
 This color is ideal for our 

00:02:33.730 --> 00:02:38.370
 gardens as it brings a touch of 

00:02:35.380 --> 00:02:38.370
 joy and youth 

00:02:40.210 --> 00:02:44.260
 this plant is easy to maintain and 

00:02:42.520 --> 00:02:47.340
 remember that we can find it only 

00:02:44.260 --> 00:02:47.340
 here in nursery Friday 

00:02:53.080 --> 00:02:56.950
 In addition to the ones we have mentioned, it 

00:02:55.360 --> 00:02:59.530
 remember that we have great variety of 

00:02:56.950 --> 00:03:02.790
 tropical plants like the ferns the 

00:02:59.530 --> 00:03:02.790
 rib of adam and the backs 

00:03:08.380 --> 00:03:12.400
 one of the most characteristic 

00:03:10.030 --> 00:03:14.440
 important in a tropical garden is that 

00:03:12.400 --> 00:03:16.840
 must have a sink or fall 

00:03:14.440 --> 00:03:19.330
 of water that must also have plants 

00:03:16.840 --> 00:03:23.040
 water this will provide a 

00:03:19.330 --> 00:03:23.040
 tropical atmosphere to our space 

00:03:36.720 --> 00:03:40.620

00:03:38.670 --> 00:03:42.540
