00:00:10.000 --> 00:00:14.000
 Electronic components inside the computer produce heat during operation. 

00:00:15.000 --> 00:00:19.000
 If the temperature inside the computer is too high, sensitive components may be damaged. 

00:00:20.000 --> 00:00:22.000
 These components can be expensive and difficult to replace. 

00:00:23.000 --> 00:00:29.000
 Excessive heat can cause the computer to freeze, unexpected shutdown, or the computer may not turn on. 

00:00:30.000 --> 00:00:33.000
 The computer can also be considerably louder because of it. 

00:00:34.000 --> 00:00:42.000
 To prevent overheating, the computer is equipped with fans and air vents that deliver cool air to the computer and remove hot air from it. 

00:00:43.000 --> 00:00:49.000
 This airflow cools sensitive components very well as a car cooler that protects the engine from overheating. 

00:00:50.000 --> 00:00:55.000
 When the temperature inside the computer increases, the fans work more to remove hot air from the computer. 

00:00:56.000 --> 00:01:00.000
 Over time, dust and other debris may accumulate, blocking the ventilation openings. 

00:01:02.000 --> 00:01:07.000
 Clogged air vents prevent hot air from being discharged, resulting in increased computer temperatures. 

00:01:08.000 --> 00:01:12.000
 Fans rotate faster and louder in response to hot air. 

00:01:13.000 --> 00:01:16.000
 If the airflow path is not fully open, the fans and other components may fail. 

00:01:17.000 --> 00:01:20.000
 If you find that the computer's fans are noisy, 

00:01:21.000 --> 00:01:24.000
 the computer's cooling system is probably dirty and needs cleaning. 

00:01:29.000 --> 00:01:33.000
 Regularly cleaning the air vents ensures that the computer does not overheat and is quiet. 

00:01:34.000 --> 00:01:39.000
 Use compressed air containers or small vacuum cleaners designed to remove electronic dust. 

00:01:40.000 --> 00:01:43.000
 Wear a respirator when using compressed air containers. 

00:01:44.000 --> 00:01:53.000
 Turn off the computer, unplug it, and then press and hold the power button for five seconds before cleaning. 

00:02:01.000 --> 00:02:05.000
 The air vents on the notebook are located on the sides and bottom. 

00:02:06.000 --> 00:02:09.000
 Find a number of vertical holes on the cabinet. 

00:02:11.000 --> 00:02:15.000
 Use compressed air or an electronic vacuum cleaner carefully for these openings. 

00:02:29.000 --> 00:02:33.000
 For desktop computers, remove the side panels and locate the soiled areas. 

00:02:38.000 --> 00:02:42.000
 Areas that typically need to be cleaned include a processor fan, a power supply, 

00:02:43.000 --> 00:02:46.000
 memory and video card (if installed on your computer). 

00:02:49.000 --> 00:02:52.000
 If you see accumulated dust, clean the area. 

00:03:05.000 --> 00:03:08.000
 Replace the side panels after cleaning. 

00:03:14.000 --> 00:03:16.000
 If you have a TouchSmart or All-in-One desktop computer. 

00:03:17.000 --> 00:03:22.000
 locate the outside air vents and blow or vacuum dust carefully. 

00:03:32.000 --> 00:03:36.000
 When finished, reconnect the power cord and turn on the computer. 

00:03:44.000 --> 00:03:50.000
 In addition to cleaning the vents, you can reduce the temperature and extend the life of your computer by following these recommendations: 

00:03:51.000 --> 00:03:54.000
 Use your computer in a well-ventilated room. 

00:03:55.000 --> 00:03:59.000
 Do not place the computer on the floor or on a carpet surface. 

00:04:00.000 --> 00:04:05.000
 Do not place laptops on a cloth such as a blanket. 

00:04:05.000 --> 00:04:10.000
 Provide enough space around the computer for proper airflow. 

00:04:11.000 --> 00:04:16.000
 Use the HP Support Assistant diagnostic software to test for hardware failures. 

00:04:17.000 --> 00:04:20.000
 Replace defective fans or other components. 

00:04:21.000 --> 00:04:24.000
 For tower-mounted desktops, add another fan to the slot. 

00:04:26.000 --> 00:04:33.000
