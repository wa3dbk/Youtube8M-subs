00:00:00.380 --> 00:00:03.669
 this request I hope you are doing well on Wednesday 2 February 

00:00:04.560 --> 00:00:06.780
 a little less it's going pretty well 

00:00:06.780 --> 00:00:10.120
 % and even wake up make it a little video announcing party 

00:00:10.849 --> 00:00:13.639
 the manufacturer information group 

00:00:13.639 --> 00:00:17.189
 in fact and I just started all the stars we will not do wrong 

00:00:17.189 --> 00:00:20.710
 so that's where I think you understood that ps3 section no longer exists 

00:00:20.710 --> 00:00:23.710
 finally its marks in the description of the chain so 

00:00:24.749 --> 00:00:28.509
 it no longer exists but hey it's not sad either because in fact only 

00:00:28.509 --> 00:00:29.779
 enjoyed 

00:00:29.779 --> 00:00:30.859
 players 

00:00:30.859 --> 00:00:34.190
 his party of ps3 on the other cases besides would have to look at 

00:00:34.190 --> 00:00:37.500
 my mailbox because i think microsoft had to send me a little tibet 

00:00:37.500 --> 00:00:40.860
 like that there to tell me that their turnover to largely 

00:00:40.860 --> 00:00:43.910
 increased thanks rica eve in the second 

00:00:43.910 --> 00:00:45.460
 joking aside 

00:00:45.460 --> 00:00:47.610
 so more of these clubs is king 

00:00:47.610 --> 00:00:49.620
 but of two section 

00:00:49.620 --> 00:00:51.200
 they make fun 360 

00:00:51.200 --> 00:00:53.340
 a wan windham section 

00:00:53.340 --> 00:00:54.360
 and percent 

00:00:54.360 --> 00:00:56.470
 sorry 

00:00:56.470 --> 00:00:58.280
 and a sport section so 

00:00:58.280 --> 00:00:59.520
 and percent 

00:00:59.520 --> 00:01:00.400
 with 

00:01:00.400 --> 00:01:04.390
 a total of five sailors members in each section to make a total of 

00:01:04.390 --> 00:01:05.580
 ten players in all 

00:01:05.580 --> 00:01:08.960
 it would be illegal 

00:01:08.960 --> 00:01:12.120
 for now the storm section that is to say me 

00:01:12.120 --> 00:01:15.250
 what a pleasure e line 4 

00:01:15.250 --> 00:01:16.470
 the little rats 

00:01:16.470 --> 00:01:17.760
 unusable 

00:01:17.760 --> 00:01:20.260
 we are full for the moment 

00:01:20.260 --> 00:01:22.050
 while everything is going well 

00:01:22.050 --> 00:01:23.259
 the section 

00:01:23.259 --> 00:01:25.190
 outside a beautiful 

00:01:25.190 --> 00:01:26.290
 On the other hand 

00:01:26.290 --> 00:01:29.039
 are only 4% a mimic gap 

00:01:29.039 --> 00:01:31.150
 keycorp perrett l 

00:01:31.150 --> 00:01:34.150
 so what will happen to these purges 

00:01:37.330 --> 00:01:40.590
 we restart what had worked the first time 

00:01:40.590 --> 00:01:43.030
 this kind of great price actually 

00:01:43.030 --> 00:01:46.340
 I do not know if it's going to happen like this because there are ka members 

00:01:46.340 --> 00:01:49.340
 recruited so it will be even harder 

00:01:50.050 --> 00:01:52.730
 I do not know how we are going to be organized and know it would not be 

00:01:52.730 --> 00:01:55.730
 wrong that you send me 1 me a message on the channel 

00:01:56.370 --> 00:01:59.120
 with your I was your gamertag 

00:01:59.120 --> 00:02:02.800
 for if you are interested to enter more who are still recruiting a 

00:02:02.800 --> 00:02:05.200
 player for the windows section to be complete 

00:02:05.200 --> 00:02:08.679
 and so that to send me here is just with wise 

00:02:08.679 --> 00:02:10.289
 reading your I was 

00:02:10.289 --> 00:02:12.569
 this new journey is disappointing 

00:02:12.569 --> 00:02:14.839
 so that would be good for him 

00:02:14.839 --> 00:02:17.259
 that's the party and 

00:02:17.259 --> 00:02:18.519
 if a few hours 

00:02:18.519 --> 00:02:21.519
 want to resume the ps3 section 

00:02:22.059 --> 00:02:25.599
 the fact that me also know because I think you're the hatchback leader 

00:02:25.599 --> 00:02:26.529
 level 

00:02:26.529 --> 00:02:28.389
 e 

00:02:28.389 --> 00:02:33.249
 of fair play% with an average age of 16 fifteen seasons it's very 

00:02:33.249 --> 00:02:33.909
 well 

00:02:33.909 --> 00:02:36.499
 even more fun of real problems 

00:02:36.499 --> 00:02:41.549
 in e fair is not - I think - it really depends on 6% and very mature sea 

00:02:44.519 --> 00:02:48.120
 I was super great thing to say right now you're recruiting for the 

00:02:48.120 --> 00:02:52.219
 section a surprise for 360 so send me your jt if you are 

00:02:52.219 --> 00:02:55.439
 interested in a type of competitive very scared 

00:02:55.439 --> 00:02:59.559
 and res what I want looking for a new section for the ps3 and that I have 

00:02:59.559 --> 00:03:02.819
 already some time its members who would be ready to go 

00:03:02.819 --> 00:03:06.989
 to leave insisted by teams who wanted especially fc banants current 

00:03:06.989 --> 00:03:09.819
 but as half of the players went to the springs it was worth more 

00:03:09.819 --> 00:03:10.849
 the shot 

00:03:10.849 --> 00:03:14.159
 in the krugman sarre this radeon who 

00:03:14.159 --> 00:03:17.229
 so here I am looking again leader who could resume without difficulty 

00:03:17.229 --> 00:03:18.779
 it would not hurt 

00:03:18.779 --> 00:03:22.839
 if you are interested too and swing it - planet wise on the chain 

00:03:22.839 --> 00:03:24.119
 in private 

00:03:24.119 --> 00:03:28.119
 with if possible your address skaÃ¯ tv cnl porte 

00:03:28.679 --> 00:03:32.129
 to speak better, it's easier than the message from the tunnel 

00:03:32.879 --> 00:03:34.739
 and here I am thinking of doing 

00:03:34.739 --> 00:03:37.109
 this is my ad 

00:03:37.109 --> 00:03:39.059
 here I did what I had to do 

00:03:39.059 --> 00:03:43.539
 for for projects there from the times finally videos before ap i'm 

00:03:43.539 --> 00:03:45.399
 preparing a duel internship 

00:03:45.399 --> 00:03:48.789
 with me and who has rarely criticized by month 

00:03:49.759 --> 00:03:52.889
 on the strong symbols we understood it 

00:03:52.889 --> 00:03:57.009
 he should go out in the I do not know maybe two weeks three 

00:03:57.009 --> 00:03:58.219
 weeks 

00:03:58.219 --> 00:04:01.219
 or maybe even before maximum week in France 

00:04:05.359 --> 00:04:06.829
 do you see rule 

00:04:06.829 --> 00:04:08.309
 it is simply enough 

00:04:08.309 --> 00:04:11.899
 so here to summarize to do this is for the section where there is 

00:04:11.899 --> 00:04:13.209
 not a player 

00:04:13.209 --> 00:04:17.709
 so send me your tax step the interested t for the ps3 section 

00:04:17.709 --> 00:04:19.590
 a new ps3 section 

00:04:19.590 --> 00:04:23.640
 I am looking for a leader who is willing to take all this and why not 

00:04:25.240 --> 00:04:28.610
 I wish a good end of the day See you soon no more
