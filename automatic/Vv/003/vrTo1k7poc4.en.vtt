the<00:00:34.950> pad<00:00:35.160> lighter<00:00:35.460> by<00:00:35.700> using<00:00:35.969> this<00:00:36.180> and<00:00:36.450> make

00:00:36.560 --> 00:00:36.570 
the pad lighter by using this and make

00:00:36.570 --> 00:00:40.160 
the pad lighter by using this and make
it<00:00:36.600> strong<00:00:37.020> to<00:00:37.260> protect<00:00:37.649> the<00:00:37.739> player<00:00:38.360> also<00:00:39.360> we

00:00:40.160 --> 00:00:40.170 
it strong to protect the player also we

00:00:40.170 --> 00:00:45.049 
it strong to protect the player also we
have<00:00:40.320> swivel<00:00:40.710> front<00:00:42.350> and<00:00:43.350> swivel<00:00:43.739> backs<00:00:44.190> this

00:00:45.049 --> 00:00:45.059 
have swivel front and swivel backs this

00:00:45.059 --> 00:00:46.940 
have swivel front and swivel backs this
moves<00:00:45.390> with<00:00:45.570> the<00:00:45.600> player<00:00:45.960> give<00:00:46.469> him<00:00:46.680> more

00:00:46.940 --> 00:00:46.950 
moves with the player give him more

00:00:46.950 --> 00:00:50.930 
moves with the player give him more
mobility<00:00:47.539> also<00:00:48.539> upon<00:00:48.870> impact<00:00:49.350> the<00:00:50.129> pad<00:00:50.370> shifts

00:00:50.930 --> 00:00:50.940 
mobility also upon impact the pad shifts

00:00:50.940 --> 00:00:53.209 
mobility also upon impact the pad shifts
this<00:00:51.420> allows<00:00:51.780> the<00:00:52.020> impact<00:00:52.379> to<00:00:52.469> disperse<00:00:52.920> away

00:00:53.209 --> 00:00:53.219 
this allows the impact to disperse away

00:00:53.219 --> 00:00:57.410 
this allows the impact to disperse away
from<00:00:53.460> the<00:00:53.550> player<00:00:54.289> we<00:00:55.289> also<00:00:55.440> have<00:00:56.420> steel

00:00:57.410 --> 00:00:57.420 
from the player we also have steel

00:00:57.420 --> 00:01:01.880 
from the player we also have steel
spring<00:00:57.750> arches<00:00:59.750> provides<00:01:00.750> greater<00:01:01.140> fit<00:01:01.559> and

00:01:01.880 --> 00:01:01.890 
spring arches provides greater fit and

00:01:01.890 --> 00:01:04.340 
spring arches provides greater fit and
the<00:01:02.340> plaid<00:01:02.550> the<00:01:02.910> pad<00:01:03.120> doesn't<00:01:03.510> go<00:01:03.600> flat<00:01:03.930> our

00:01:04.340 --> 00:01:04.350 
the plaid the pad doesn't go flat our

00:01:04.350 --> 00:01:06.770 
the plaid the pad doesn't go flat our
next<00:01:04.619> pad<00:01:04.890> is<00:01:05.220> our<00:01:05.369> top-of-the-line<00:01:05.610> alt<00:01:06.510> pad

00:01:06.770 --> 00:01:06.780 
next pad is our top-of-the-line alt pad

00:01:06.780 --> 00:01:09.590 
next pad is our top-of-the-line alt pad
again<00:01:07.619> we<00:01:08.549> just<00:01:08.760> want<00:01:08.970> to<00:01:09.060> show<00:01:09.180> all<00:01:09.360> of<00:01:09.510> our

00:01:09.590 --> 00:01:09.600 
again we just want to show all of our

00:01:09.600 --> 00:01:11.560 
again we just want to show all of our
different<00:01:09.750> features<00:01:10.290> we<00:01:10.560> keep<00:01:10.740> the<00:01:10.920> swivel

00:01:11.560 --> 00:01:11.570 
different features we keep the swivel

00:01:11.570 --> 00:01:15.469 
different features we keep the swivel
front<00:01:12.570> and<00:01:12.840> back<00:01:13.700> allows<00:01:14.700> to<00:01:14.970> move<00:01:15.150> with<00:01:15.360> the

00:01:15.469 --> 00:01:15.479 
front and back allows to move with the

00:01:15.479 --> 00:01:18.200 
front and back allows to move with the
player<00:01:15.780> but<00:01:16.259> also<00:01:16.580> shifts<00:01:17.580> upon<00:01:17.850> impact

00:01:18.200 --> 00:01:18.210 
player but also shifts upon impact

00:01:18.210 --> 00:01:19.520 
player but also shifts upon impact
throwing<00:01:18.600> that<00:01:18.720> energy<00:01:19.080> away<00:01:19.229> from<00:01:19.259> the

00:01:19.520 --> 00:01:19.530 
throwing that energy away from the

00:01:19.530 --> 00:01:21.710 
throwing that energy away from the
player<00:01:19.909> we<00:01:20.909> also<00:01:21.090> have<00:01:21.270> the<00:01:21.570> only

00:01:21.710 --> 00:01:21.720 
player we also have the only

00:01:21.720 --> 00:01:23.719 
player we also have the only
polycarbonate<00:01:22.560> up<00:01:22.740> ulit<00:01:23.009> in<00:01:23.130> the<00:01:23.280> industry

00:01:23.719 --> 00:01:23.729 
polycarbonate up ulit in the industry

00:01:23.729 --> 00:01:25.399 
polycarbonate up ulit in the industry
the<00:01:23.880> reason<00:01:24.150> we<00:01:24.240> use<00:01:24.270> polycarbonate<00:01:25.140> has<00:01:25.380> a

00:01:25.399 --> 00:01:25.409 
the reason we use polycarbonate has a

00:01:25.409 --> 00:01:28.190 
the reason we use polycarbonate has a
higher<00:01:25.799> tensile<00:01:26.130> and<00:01:26.490> breaking<00:01:27.119> strength<00:01:27.450> so

00:01:28.190 --> 00:01:28.200 
higher tensile and breaking strength so

00:01:28.200 --> 00:01:29.929 
higher tensile and breaking strength so
upon<00:01:28.409> impact<00:01:28.829> the<00:01:29.070> energy<00:01:29.400> has<00:01:29.490> to<00:01:29.520> travel

00:01:29.929 --> 00:01:29.939 
upon impact the energy has to travel

00:01:29.939 --> 00:01:32.120 
upon impact the energy has to travel
around<00:01:30.119> the<00:01:30.390> entire<00:01:30.659> up<00:01:30.930> ulit<00:01:31.229> before<00:01:31.920> it<00:01:32.009> goes

00:01:32.120 --> 00:01:32.130 
around the entire up ulit before it goes

00:01:32.130 --> 00:01:34.399 
around the entire up ulit before it goes
down<00:01:32.189> to<00:01:32.460> the<00:01:32.729> player<00:01:33.030> therefore<00:01:33.840> protecting

down to the player therefore protecting

00:01:34.409 --> 00:01:35.870 
down to the player therefore protecting
and<00:01:34.560> getting<00:01:34.770> that<00:01:34.890> energy<00:01:35.280> away<00:01:35.490> from<00:01:35.520> the
