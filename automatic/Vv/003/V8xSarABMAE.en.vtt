00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.700
 hi guys do you hear it was evil borscht 

00:00:02.370 --> 00:00:08.179
 and in flight even the most juicy fresh 

00:00:05.700 --> 00:00:10.469
 news from the world of tanks and today 

00:00:08.179 --> 00:00:13.679
 fresh screen processed corr 

00:00:10.469 --> 00:00:16.850
 new tanks already got on the super test a 

00:00:13.679 --> 00:00:25.350
 just a couple of news that you are ready 

00:00:16.850 --> 00:00:27.380
 went well, that card card 

00:00:25.350 --> 00:00:30.179
 reworked by developers 

00:00:27.380 --> 00:00:33.360
 standing to sleep worn some 

00:00:30.179 --> 00:00:35.399
 new new edits so today we already 

00:00:33.360 --> 00:00:37.559
 we have the opportunity to see the changes on 

00:00:35.399 --> 00:00:40.050
 some maps namely Karelia without 

00:00:37.559 --> 00:00:42.719
 labor sandy river and the sacred valley 

00:00:40.050 --> 00:00:44.460
 but if the last card was just 

00:00:42.719 --> 00:00:47.250
 updated clean from a cosmetic point 

00:00:44.460 --> 00:00:49.379
 view that the first three will be satisfied 

00:00:47.250 --> 00:00:51.930
 seriously changed in relief this is even 

00:00:49.379 --> 00:00:54.149
 seen on screen at what you are 

00:00:51.930 --> 00:00:56.250
 of course you can be sure right now 

00:00:54.149 --> 00:00:58.320
 Karelia will change the city apparently 

00:00:56.250 --> 00:01:00.840
 7 change so too much can be 

00:00:58.320 --> 00:01:02.760
 call in now from two sides of the shot 

00:01:00.840 --> 00:01:04.979
 where is the landscape along the bridge changed 

00:01:02.760 --> 00:01:07.860
 zero line and on the opposite 

00:01:04.979 --> 00:01:10.320
 side of the map around square c3 where 

00:01:07.860 --> 00:01:11.820
 usually happens the characters themselves in 

00:01:10.320 --> 00:01:14.880
 the case with a sandy river they can 

00:01:11.820 --> 00:01:16.380
 say only one thing and never learn 

00:01:14.880 --> 00:01:19.439
 firstly because there was a new one 

00:01:16.380 --> 00:01:21.150
 passage square f4 which probably 

00:01:19.439 --> 00:01:23.369
 significantly change the gameplay at 

00:01:21.150 --> 00:01:25.680
 the closest opportunity and besides that 

00:01:23.369 --> 00:01:28.220
 there was a second passage to the southern village 

00:01:25.680 --> 00:01:29.690
 squared g6 i think 

00:01:28.220 --> 00:01:31.610
 the gameplay on this map will be the most 

00:01:29.690 --> 00:01:33.410
 significant to be honest to me 

00:01:31.610 --> 00:01:34.850
 a bit surprising because so sandy 

00:01:33.410 --> 00:01:37.040
 River as the general picture is not here 

00:01:34.850 --> 00:01:40.310
 no particular complaints oh well 

00:01:37.040 --> 00:01:42.260
 the next news is on a super test of almost 99 

00:01:40.310 --> 00:01:45.290
 new tanks have already arrived 

00:01:42.260 --> 00:01:46.610
 namely the already known hp panzer replacement 

00:01:45.290 --> 00:01:49.220
 flyer sponsor panther 

00:01:46.610 --> 00:01:54.470
 and a new medium tank of the eighth level 

00:01:49.220 --> 00:01:56.450
 probably premium m4a 13 valyrians i 

00:01:54.470 --> 00:01:58.070
 I hope I read French 

00:01:56.450 --> 00:01:59.960
 right well, like in the transcript I look 

00:01:58.070 --> 00:02:02.060
 so anyway it will be sherman 

00:01:59.960 --> 00:02:04.490
 like sherlock we have already seen a lot 

00:02:02.060 --> 00:02:06.920
 however this one will be on the eighth level 

00:02:04.490 --> 00:02:08.570
 In general, what are these two tanks like? 

00:02:06.920 --> 00:02:11.209
 to represent in terms of gameplay we 

00:02:08.570 --> 00:02:13.910
 find out a little later and now go to 

00:02:11.209 --> 00:02:14.870
 less significant news first file 

00:02:13.910 --> 00:02:17.270
 162 

00:02:14.870 --> 00:02:19.459
 Many already know about him, but those who donâ€™t 

00:02:17.270 --> 00:02:22.220
 please know it in Moscow now 

00:02:19.459 --> 00:02:25.520
 equal to 0 millimeters and that means that 

00:02:22.220 --> 00:02:27.080
 you can penetrate anyone 

00:02:25.520 --> 00:02:28.550
 Of course it is small enough 

00:02:27.080 --> 00:02:31.070
 vytsepit it can only be except that 

00:02:28.550 --> 00:02:32.930
 emphasis and yet such a vulnerable area 

00:02:31.070 --> 00:02:34.940
 I think in clinch right now to her 

00:02:32.930 --> 00:02:37.130
 can someone brazenly finger you of course 

00:02:34.940 --> 00:02:39.440
 developers will fix it I think already 

00:02:37.130 --> 00:02:41.600
 very soon but sediment with owners 

00:02:39.440 --> 00:02:43.760
 t-62 will surely stay 

00:02:41.600 --> 00:02:46.190
 Well, still literally a couple of news from 

00:02:43.760 --> 00:02:48.410
 storm rather a couple soaking off 

00:02:46.190 --> 00:02:50.420
 storms namely he did not reveal 

00:02:48.410 --> 00:02:51.950
 rebalance detail of gold shells 

00:02:50.420 --> 00:02:53.840
 rainbow states and rebalances 

00:02:51.950 --> 00:02:55.550
 nestor bend but he admits that 

00:02:53.840 --> 00:02:57.500
 Indeed, some guns have 

00:02:55.550 --> 00:03:00.110
 problem due to excessive armor penetration 

00:02:57.500 --> 00:03:02.060
 plus unfortunately the storm did not understand what they 

00:03:00.110 --> 00:03:04.370
 Viktor sour when she said some 

00:03:02.060 --> 00:03:06.890
 a burger that is a big planned 

00:03:04.370 --> 00:03:09.350
 She is not well, really, there is one 

00:03:06.890 --> 00:03:12.440
 interesting news namely that the storm 

00:03:09.350 --> 00:03:14.870
 confirmed that the update but also 910 will 

00:03:12.440 --> 00:03:16.400
 big that is very meaningful 

00:03:14.870 --> 00:03:18.920
 of course we can only 

00:03:16.400 --> 00:03:21.200
 assume on the subject what will be there 

00:03:18.920 --> 00:03:23.209
 This update is the most likely that they 

00:03:21.200 --> 00:03:24.580
 finally finish the physics because she 

00:03:23.209 --> 00:03:27.520
 big special world 

00:03:24.580 --> 00:03:29.170
 havoc abandoned dx11 support i 

00:03:27.520 --> 00:03:31.240
 I suppose it was planned along with x wacom 

00:03:29.170 --> 00:03:32.800
 though of course there could be wrong but 

00:03:31.240 --> 00:03:34.840
 in my opinion the only real thing 

00:03:32.800 --> 00:03:36.520
 which should be on the way it is 

00:03:34.840 --> 00:03:37.870
 physics and so i will count 

00:03:36.520 --> 00:03:40.990
 just for her 

00:03:37.870 --> 00:03:43.930
 over my it nevertheless for today is 

00:03:40.990 --> 00:03:45.700
 were the most interesting news and me 

00:03:43.930 --> 00:03:47.440
 perhaps it's time to stray not 

00:03:45.700 --> 00:03:49.810
 forget to subscribe to the channel here's a fan 

00:03:47.440 --> 00:03:51.550
 and also on my own channel this 

00:03:49.810 --> 00:03:53.920
 there was a transfer easy digest we are with you 

00:03:51.550 --> 00:03:56.460
 there was a failure borsch i say goodbye to you 

00:03:53.920 --> 00:03:56.460
 meeting
