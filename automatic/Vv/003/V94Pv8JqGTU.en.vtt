00:03:12.630 --> 00:03:17.480 
can actually reach the enemy positions
it's<00:03:12.990> like<00:03:13.230> it's<00:03:14.130> a<00:03:15.560> today's<00:03:16.560> dish<00:03:16.830> is<00:03:17.220> like

00:03:17.480 --> 00:03:17.490 
it's like it's a today's dish is like

00:03:17.490 --> 00:03:20.330 
it's like it's a today's dish is like
pan<00:03:18.050> and<00:03:19.050> then<00:03:19.230> spammies<00:03:19.590> takeover<00:03:20.010> that<00:03:20.130> she

got<00:03:20.580> down<00:03:20.820> there<00:03:21.030> to<00:03:25.790> move<00:03:26.790> my<00:03:27.060> a<00:03:27.420> ships<00:03:27.720> and<00:03:27.990> be

00:03:28.070 --> 00:03:28.080 
got down there to move my a ships and be

00:03:28.080 --> 00:03:34.670 
got down there to move my a ships and be
closer<00:03:28.380> to<00:03:28.770> button<00:03:33.080> generate<00:03:34.080> for

00:03:34.670 --> 00:03:34.680 
closer to button generate for

00:03:34.680 --> 00:03:37.360 
closer to button generate for
long-distance<00:03:35.520> attacks

00:03:37.360 --> 00:03:37.370 
long-distance attacks

00:03:37.370 --> 00:03:39.950 
long-distance attacks
looks<00:03:38.370> like<00:03:38.520> capture<00:03:38.880> that<00:03:39.060> pay<00:03:39.270> station<00:03:39.750> -

00:03:39.950 --> 00:03:39.960 
looks like capture that pay station -

00:03:39.960 --> 00:04:03.900 
looks like capture that pay station -
let's<00:03:40.230> try<00:03:40.440> to<00:03:40.500> take<00:03:40.830> over<00:03:41.160> a<00:03:41.190> few<00:03:41.460> of<00:03:41.670> the

00:04:03.900 --> 00:04:03.910 

00:04:03.910 --> 00:04:12.690 

down<00:04:04.910> there<00:04:10.390> captured<00:04:11.390> another<00:04:11.810> base<00:04:12.170> station

00:04:12.690 --> 00:04:12.700 
down there captured another base station

00:04:12.700 --> 00:04:18.190 
down there captured another base station
unit<00:04:13.700> construct<00:04:14.420> I<00:04:14.780> guess<00:04:16.780> good<00:04:17.780> over<00:04:18.020> there

00:04:18.190 --> 00:04:18.200 
unit construct I guess good over there

00:04:18.200 --> 00:04:24.240 
unit construct I guess good over there
let<00:04:18.470> me<00:04:18.500> move<00:04:18.770> my<00:04:18.830> cruisers<00:04:19.459> move<00:04:19.610> it<00:04:19.760> sells

00:04:24.240 --> 00:04:24.250 

00:04:24.250 --> 00:04:26.590 

and<00:04:25.250> yeah<00:04:25.400> England<00:04:26.000> just<00:04:26.090> landed<00:04:26.450> on<00:04:26.540> the

00:04:26.590 --> 00:04:26.600 
and yeah England just landed on the

00:04:26.600 --> 00:04:29.320 
and yeah England just landed on the
beach<00:04:26.810> too<00:04:27.140> and<00:04:27.980> I<00:04:28.220> think<00:04:28.280> things<00:04:28.910> are<00:04:29.090> going

00:04:29.320 --> 00:04:29.330 
beach too and I think things are going

00:04:29.330 --> 00:04:32.260 
beach too and I think things are going
