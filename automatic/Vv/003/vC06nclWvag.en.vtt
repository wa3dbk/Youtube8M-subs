00:00:04.520 --> 00:00:07.900
 all very alert from ticket sales 

00:00:08.759 --> 00:00:13.539
 4 under the forty years during this restructuring 

00:00:13.539 --> 00:00:17.250
 and for this year I can be met 

00:00:17.250 --> 00:00:18.859
 a 

00:00:18.859 --> 00:00:21.859
 2 

00:00:24.819 --> 00:00:29.330
 We get more in biggest opponent I do well 

00:00:29.330 --> 00:00:32.330
 to play this 

00:00:33.250 --> 00:00:35.649
 this is the third largest in rotterdam 

00:00:35.649 --> 00:00:38.649
 there I could need that for that we are working 

00:00:39.290 --> 00:00:41.290
 d 

00:00:41.290 --> 00:00:44.120
 dated 3 

00:00:44.120 --> 00:00:48.670
 I sing along at a slower pace and also became the players in the chord 

00:00:48.670 --> 00:00:50.400
 were on once 

00:00:50.400 --> 00:00:51.840
 and there we are 

00:00:51.840 --> 00:00:56.050
 can play at this slow pace there you can increase the tempo yourself to the 

00:00:56.050 --> 00:00:57.590
 started searching 

00:00:57.590 --> 00:01:00.860
 and I did think it is a nice fight, so it is right 

00:01:00.860 --> 00:01:03.450
 level or not much to fear 

00:01:03.450 --> 00:01:05.880
 at a fast pace that did not work 

00:01:05.880 --> 00:01:08.880
 but first the langstraat version 

00:01:09.880 --> 00:01:12.330
 a round 

00:01:12.330 --> 00:01:14.180
 among others 

00:01:14.180 --> 00:01:17.180
 a frenk bite 

00:01:24.010 --> 00:01:26.980
 the 

00:01:26.980 --> 00:01:30.120
 one after the other 

00:01:38.430 --> 00:01:40.840
 to be honest 

00:01:40.840 --> 00:01:43.170
 who learn and work 

00:01:43.170 --> 00:01:45.520
 novice and 

00:01:45.520 --> 00:01:48.680
 in a blistering heat 

00:01:48.680 --> 00:01:53.850
 the longer it's confusion normally 

00:01:53.850 --> 00:01:56.850
 the pink 

00:01:57.840 --> 00:02:00.840
 but 

00:02:02.970 --> 00:02:05.970
 the hand 

00:02:09.249 --> 00:02:11.329
 the unemployed for 

00:02:11.329 --> 00:02:12.649
 under the hand 

00:02:12.649 --> 00:02:16.609
 in the end, of course, fireworks became the management 

00:02:17.219 --> 00:02:18.189
 sing along 

00:02:18.189 --> 00:02:20.260
 I have this lady nowhere 

00:02:20.260 --> 00:02:23.219
 I get you the eleventh 

00:02:23.219 --> 00:02:24.250
 one of the four 

00:02:24.250 --> 00:02:28.500
 editors proceed carefully Wednesday other question how long the frameworks
