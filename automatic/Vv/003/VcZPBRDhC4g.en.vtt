00:00:05.290 --> 00:00:10.970
 or the miserable beautiful soft filled with 

00:00:08.180 --> 00:00:12.590
 light and full of life very happy that 

00:00:10.970 --> 00:00:14.540
 be back in the song channel 

00:00:12.590 --> 00:00:16.520
 flowers and today I will be talking 

00:00:14.540 --> 00:00:18.829
 with you about the basic kit of 

00:00:16.520 --> 00:00:21.500
 makeup for beginners this video 

00:00:18.829 --> 00:00:23.960
 has divided two people first to the 

00:00:21.500 --> 00:00:25.700
 teen girls who are thinking 

00:00:23.960 --> 00:00:28.460
 to start in the world of makeup 

00:00:25.700 --> 00:00:30.290
 and they do not know where to start and second 

00:00:28.460 --> 00:00:32.180
 to the girls who are not so girls but 

00:00:30.290 --> 00:00:34.370
 that for some reason they have stopped 

00:00:32.180 --> 00:00:36.769
 make up and are interested in 

00:00:34.370 --> 00:00:38.359
 return to the makeup world so 

00:00:36.769 --> 00:00:40.489
 if you understand one of the two 

00:00:38.359 --> 00:00:41.660
 categories I invite you to stay 

00:00:40.489 --> 00:00:43.640
 the time of us more than no longer 

00:00:41.660 --> 00:00:46.820
 we must understand that we will be 

00:00:43.640 --> 00:00:49.070
 attending three particular areas of 

00:00:46.820 --> 00:00:51.350
 face that will be first the 

00:00:49.070 --> 00:00:54.170
 face the second area is going to be the eyes 

00:00:51.350 --> 00:00:55.070
 and the third one is going to be cheeks with 

00:00:54.170 --> 00:00:57.850
 lips 

00:00:55.070 --> 00:01:00.409
 so by telling you this let's start 

00:00:57.850 --> 00:01:03.230
 recommending that before you put on makeup 

00:01:00.409 --> 00:01:06.670
 you must have clean skin 

00:01:03.230 --> 00:01:09.890
 and humid you should also use 

00:01:06.670 --> 00:01:11.750
 sunscreen or sunscreen because 

00:01:09.890 --> 00:01:13.340
 the means of the sun do not forgive and then 

00:01:11.750 --> 00:01:15.440
 They are creating spots on your skin that 

00:01:13.340 --> 00:01:16.970
 you will not want and then we will 

00:01:15.440 --> 00:01:20.810
 want to sing pando las and it's going to be a 

00:01:16.970 --> 00:01:23.390
 bit difficult the task so once 

00:01:20.810 --> 00:01:25.729
 you have your sunscreen put on 

00:01:23.390 --> 00:01:27.860
 let's take care of what is the most trip 

00:01:25.729 --> 00:01:30.979
 of the face for this should recommend 

00:01:27.860 --> 00:01:34.310
 two types of products the baby film 

00:01:30.979 --> 00:01:36.320
 office 'and cream and the base is different 

00:01:34.310 --> 00:01:38.420
 because the wine is cycling are a type 

00:01:36.320 --> 00:01:40.940
 of moisturizer that most attracts 

00:01:38.420 --> 00:01:43.310
 is skin or is a sunscreen and 

00:01:40.940 --> 00:01:45.140
 they have dye so this kind of 

00:01:43.310 --> 00:01:47.869
 makeup I recommend it for 

00:01:45.140 --> 00:01:50.300
 girls who barely have marks or 

00:01:47.869 --> 00:01:52.820
 redness or situations that cover 

00:01:50.300 --> 00:01:54.140
 on the skin so perfect to use it 

00:01:52.820 --> 00:01:56.570
 in the day to day 

00:01:54.140 --> 00:01:59.240
 Now if you have some kind of sea ​​that 

00:01:56.570 --> 00:02:01.100
 is stronger than you want to cover or 

00:01:59.240 --> 00:02:03.800
 disguise because it would be very good 

00:02:01.100 --> 00:02:05.420
 use the base anyway we're going to 

00:02:03.800 --> 00:02:07.340
 from having a complexion to being 

00:02:05.420 --> 00:02:09.200
 Pretty well-groomed teenager 

00:02:07.340 --> 00:02:11.330
 I could use the divine 

00:02:09.200 --> 00:02:14.239
 hi yes cycling every day and also have 

00:02:11.330 --> 00:02:17.060
 a basis for some date or occasion 

00:02:14.239 --> 00:02:19.250
 special then we have this kind of 

00:02:17.060 --> 00:02:21.890
 paint for the whole face we are going to 

00:02:19.250 --> 00:02:25.129
 move to the third product that would be the 

00:02:21.890 --> 00:02:27.980
 corrector or the concealer in English and the 

00:02:25.129 --> 00:02:30.370
 corrector will be used under the 

00:02:27.980 --> 00:02:32.569
 eyes to hide your dark circles 

00:02:30.370 --> 00:02:34.819
 equally for any stain that 

00:02:32.569 --> 00:02:37.760
 you could have on your skin you can put 

00:02:34.819 --> 00:02:40.430
 a dot on it and cover it for 

00:02:37.760 --> 00:02:43.190
 disguise it after we 'll have the 

00:02:40.430 --> 00:02:47.060
 face with the viola city queens and the 

00:02:43.190 --> 00:02:49.849
 base and the corrector let's move on to 

00:02:47.060 --> 00:02:53.120
 area of the eyes for this I recommend you 

00:02:49.849 --> 00:02:55.849
 you buy a shadow kit to see 

00:02:53.120 --> 00:02:58.430
 my understand a minimum of three colors and 

00:02:55.849 --> 00:03:00.019
 mainly that they were neutral to 

00:02:58.430 --> 00:03:01.240
 that so they can use it in the 

00:03:00.019 --> 00:03:03.760
 devil live 

00:03:01.240 --> 00:03:07.300
 and if you have the possibility 

00:03:03.760 --> 00:03:10.420
 economic to have a wider palette 

00:03:07.300 --> 00:03:13.090
 of colors because I could acquire colors 

00:03:10.420 --> 00:03:14.830
 bright or dramatic colors so that 

00:03:13.090 --> 00:03:17.170
 start playing with all this kind of 

00:03:14.830 --> 00:03:18.970
 colors and even you may have other 

00:03:17.170 --> 00:03:21.640
 paintings for some special occasion 

00:03:18.970 --> 00:03:24.760
 besides the shadow I recommend them 

00:03:21.640 --> 00:03:26.680
 get 1 to 2 eyeliners 

00:03:24.760 --> 00:03:28.510
 the classic colors that would be the brown 

00:03:26.680 --> 00:03:31.330
 and black if you can not have both 

00:03:28.510 --> 00:03:33.970
 quiet as you buy one you also go 

00:03:31.330 --> 00:03:36.550
 to need a mask or a mascara 

00:03:33.970 --> 00:03:39.370
 eyelashes you're going to need paint for 

00:03:36.550 --> 00:03:41.230
 eyebrow pencil eyebrows or some kit 

00:03:39.370 --> 00:03:42.910
 shadows that come precisely for 

00:03:41.230 --> 00:03:45.250
 treat the eyebrows if you do not have any 

00:03:42.910 --> 00:03:47.050
 specific paint for eyebrows very well 

00:03:45.250 --> 00:03:49.780
 they could use some eye shadow 

00:03:47.050 --> 00:03:53.290
 that is a color quite similar to 

00:03:49.780 --> 00:03:55.930
 of your hair then we have this 

00:03:53.290 --> 00:03:58.720
 area of ​​the eyes we will move to the 

00:03:55.930 --> 00:04:00.550
 third area of ​​the face that needs 

00:03:58.720 --> 00:04:02.190
 treat yourself with makeup and they will be 

00:04:00.550 --> 00:04:05.040
 the cheeks 

00:04:02.190 --> 00:04:07.080
 lips to treat the cheeks I'm going to 

00:04:05.040 --> 00:04:10.050
 recommend that you buy a rumor or 

00:04:07.080 --> 00:04:11.970
 blusher or blog and if you can buy two 

00:04:10.050 --> 00:04:14.370
 one pink and one coral colored 

00:04:11.970 --> 00:04:17.580
 so perfect and finally you're going to 

00:04:14.370 --> 00:04:20.489
 need to buy lipstick and then 

00:04:17.580 --> 00:04:22.560
 that we treat the face the eyes the 

00:04:20.489 --> 00:04:25.350
 cheeks and lips we are going to finish 

00:04:22.560 --> 00:04:27.180
 with the touch of dust I will come in 

00:04:25.350 --> 00:04:30.540
 compact to the loose so you buy in 

00:04:27.180 --> 00:04:32.970

00:04:32.970 --> 00:04:40.110
 that makeup that you used go to 

00:04:36.300 --> 00:04:41.790
