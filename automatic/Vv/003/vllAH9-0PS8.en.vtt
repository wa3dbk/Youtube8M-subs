technique getting guys basically is a

00:03:12.350 --> 00:03:13.750 
technique getting guys basically is a

00:03:13.750 --> 00:03:13.760 
bit of a different video and hopefully

00:03:13.760 --> 00:03:16.270 
bit of a different video and hopefully
it<00:03:14.240> goes<00:03:14.360> on<00:03:14.540> quite<00:03:14.750> well<00:03:14.780> because<00:03:15.590> I<00:03:15.800> don't

at ultimate team buff I think FIFA 16
he'll<00:03:32.360> definitely<00:03:32.540> be<00:03:32.720> on<00:03:32.870> there<00:03:33.080> and<00:03:33.460> that's

00:03:34.450 --> 00:03:34.460 
he'll definitely be on there and that's

00:03:34.460 --> 00:03:36.130 
he'll definitely be on there and that's
as<00:03:34.610> long<00:03:34.790> as<00:03:34.910> it<00:03:35.030> actually<00:03:35.180> that's<00:03:35.450> as<00:03:35.810> long<00:03:35.990> as

00:03:36.130 --> 00:03:36.140 
as long as it actually that's as long as

00:03:36.140 --> 00:03:38.440 
as long as it actually that's as long as
round<00:03:36.350> reader<00:03:36.650> Castilla<00:03:37.310> are<00:03:37.850> actually<00:03:38.300> on

00:03:38.440 --> 00:03:38.450 
round reader Castilla are actually on

00:03:38.450 --> 00:03:39.640 
round reader Castilla are actually on
the<00:03:38.480> game<00:03:38.720> because<00:03:38.930> I<00:03:38.990> think<00:03:39.050> their<00:03:39.380> third

00:03:39.640 --> 00:03:39.650 
the game because I think their third

00:03:39.650 --> 00:03:41.770 
the game because I think their third
tier<00:03:39.950> of<00:03:39.980> the<00:03:40.520> Spanish<00:03:40.910> football<00:03:41.450> right<00:03:41.600> out

00:03:41.770 --> 00:03:41.780 
tier of the Spanish football right out

00:03:41.780 --> 00:03:43.900 
tier of the Spanish football right out
so<00:03:42.020> um<00:03:42.260> I<00:03:42.950> don't<00:03:43.280> know<00:03:43.490> if<00:03:43.580> we<00:03:43.700> will<00:03:43.850> be

00:03:43.900 --> 00:03:43.910 
so um I don't know if we will be

00:03:43.910 --> 00:03:45.250 
so um I don't know if we will be
actually<00:03:44.180> unless<00:03:44.510> they<00:03:44.660> put<00:03:44.810> in<00:03:44.870> the<00:03:44.930> red

00:03:45.250 --> 00:03:45.260
