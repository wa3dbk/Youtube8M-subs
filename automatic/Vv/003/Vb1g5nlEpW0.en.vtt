00:01:31.580 --> 00:01:31.590 
pointless elbow just a little bit but

00:01:31.590 --> 00:01:35.090 
pointless elbow just a little bit but
that's<00:01:32.220> the<00:01:32.610> leg<00:01:32.790> although<00:01:33.119> a<00:01:33.799> lot<00:01:34.799> of<00:01:34.890> people

have<00:01:35.280> changed<00:01:35.520> it<00:01:35.820> and<00:01:36.030> made<00:01:36.090> it<00:01:36.540> look

00:01:36.800 --> 00:01:36.810 
have changed it and made it look

00:01:36.810 --> 00:01:38.120 
have changed it and made it look
different<00:01:37.229> like<00:01:37.350> they<00:01:37.500> would<00:01:37.619> take<00:01:37.770> the<00:01:37.890> upper

00:01:38.120 --> 00:01:38.130 
different like they would take the upper

00:01:38.130 --> 00:01:39.740 
different like they would take the upper
leg<00:01:38.280> and<00:01:38.310> move<00:01:38.640> it<00:01:38.790> down<00:01:38.820> here<00:01:39.180> it's<00:01:39.299> the<00:01:39.420> angle

00:01:39.740 --> 00:01:39.750 
leg and move it down here it's the angle

00:01:39.750 --> 00:01:42.289 
leg and move it down here it's the angle
and<00:01:40.650> kind<00:01:40.890> of<00:01:40.920> do<00:01:41.070> it<00:01:41.189> that<00:01:41.369> way<00:01:41.520> I<00:01:41.549> like<00:01:42.030> the

00:01:42.289 --> 00:01:42.299 
and kind of do it that way I like the

00:01:42.299 --> 00:01:45.319 
and kind of do it that way I like the
way<00:01:42.479> this<00:01:42.840> looks<00:01:42.899> just<00:01:43.860> by<00:01:44.220> itself<00:01:44.700> like<00:01:45.119> I

00:01:45.319 --> 00:01:45.329 
way this looks just by itself like I

00:01:45.329 --> 00:01:49.280 
way this looks just by itself like I
think<00:01:46.280> it<00:01:47.280> they're<00:01:47.610> very<00:01:47.880> stubby<00:01:48.450> very<00:01:48.750> squat

00:01:49.280 --> 00:01:49.290 
think it they're very stubby very squat

00:01:49.290 --> 00:01:52.399 
think it they're very stubby very squat
legs<00:01:49.590> but<00:01:50.509> I'm<00:01:51.509> not<00:01:51.689> gonna<00:01:51.869> put<00:01:52.110> them<00:01:52.200> in<00:01:52.290> any

00:01:52.399 --> 00:01:52.409 
legs but I'm not gonna put them in any

00:01:52.409 --> 00:01:54.830 
legs but I'm not gonna put them in any
crazy<00:01:52.740> action<00:01:53.009> poses<00:01:53.610> I<00:01:53.640> mean<00:01:53.970> I<00:01:54.180> typically

00:01:54.830 --> 00:01:54.840 
crazy action poses I mean I typically

00:01:54.840 --> 00:01:56.359 
crazy action poses I mean I typically
with<00:01:55.079> these<00:01:55.259> type<00:01:55.470> of<00:01:55.500> things<00:01:55.710> for<00:01:56.009> as<00:01:56.130> long<00:01:56.250> as

00:01:56.359 --> 00:01:56.369 
with these type of things for as long as

00:01:56.369 --> 00:01:58.010 
with these type of things for as long as
I<00:01:56.490> have<00:01:56.640> them<00:01:56.790> built<00:01:57.000> which<00:01:57.270> is<00:01:57.420> a<00:01:57.450> very<00:01:57.780> short

00:01:58.010 --> 00:01:58.020 
I have them built which is a very short

00:01:58.020 --> 00:02:00.410 
I have them built which is a very short
amount<00:01:58.290> of<00:01:58.320> time<00:01:58.409> I<00:01:58.799> just<00:01:59.640> leave<00:01:59.969> them<00:02:00.119> like

00:02:00.410 --> 00:02:00.420 
amount of time I just leave them like

00:02:00.420 --> 00:02:03.289 
amount of time I just leave them like
this<00:02:00.630> just<00:02:01.200> stalk<00:02:01.469> still<00:02:01.860> well<00:02:02.549> not<00:02:02.969> like<00:02:03.119> this

00:02:03.289 --> 00:02:03.299 
this just stalk still well not like this

00:02:03.299 --> 00:02:05.270 
this just stalk still well not like this
because<00:02:03.750> this<00:02:03.990> is<00:02:04.110> just<00:02:04.229> goofy<00:02:04.560> but<00:02:05.009> I<00:02:05.070> leave

00:02:05.270 --> 00:02:05.280 
because this is just goofy but I leave

00:02:05.280 --> 00:02:07.880 
because this is just goofy but I leave
them<00:02:05.399> stalk<00:02:05.640> still<00:02:05.969> just<00:02:06.689> standing<00:02:06.960> and<00:02:07.530> this

00:02:07.880 --> 00:02:07.890 
them stalk still just standing and this

00:02:07.890 --> 00:02:09.559 
them stalk still just standing and this
stance<00:02:08.250> alone<00:02:08.610> I<00:02:08.640> think<00:02:08.879> looks<00:02:09.149> perfectly

00:02:09.559 --> 00:02:09.569 
stance alone I think looks perfectly

00:02:09.569 --> 00:02:12.040 
stance alone I think looks perfectly
fine<00:02:09.660> it<00:02:10.080> looks<00:02:10.319> really<00:02:10.739> cool

00:02:12.040 --> 00:02:12.050 
fine it looks really cool

00:02:12.050 --> 00:02:15.790 
fine it looks really cool

moving on here we have my favorite part
about<00:02:15.830> this<00:02:16.100> guy<00:02:16.250> is<00:02:16.490> his<00:02:16.760> chest<00:02:17.150> which<00:02:18.250> it's

00:02:19.240 --> 00:02:19.250 
about this guy is his chest which it's

00:02:19.250 --> 00:02:21.460 
about this guy is his chest which it's
similar<00:02:19.790> to<00:02:20.270> how<00:02:20.390> the<00:02:20.450> protector<00:02:21.110> of<00:02:21.140> Earth's

00:02:21.460 --> 00:02:21.470 
similar to how the protector of Earth's

00:02:21.470 --> 00:02:24.820 
similar to how the protector of Earth's
chest<00:02:22.070> is<00:02:22.340> made<00:02:22.660> except<00:02:23.660> he<00:02:23.810> has<00:02:23.990> one<00:02:24.290> of<00:02:24.410> these

00:02:24.820 --> 00:02:24.830 
chest is made except he has one of these

00:02:24.830 --> 00:02:26.860 
chest is made except he has one of these
Norma<00:02:25.610> pieces<00:02:25.940> here<00:02:26.090> which<00:02:26.240> I<00:02:26.420> think<00:02:26.690> this

00:02:26.860 --> 00:02:26.870 
Norma pieces here which I think this

00:02:26.870 --> 00:02:29.590 
Norma pieces here which I think this
look<00:02:27.200> by<00:02:27.380> itself<00:02:27.740> looks<00:02:28.610> fantastic<00:02:29.270> and<00:02:29.480> I

00:02:29.590 --> 00:02:29.600 
look by itself looks fantastic and I

00:02:29.600 --> 00:02:32.800 
look by itself looks fantastic and I
cannot<00:02:30.440> wait<00:02:30.650> until<00:02:30.830> we<00:02:31.760> get<00:02:31.850> a<00:02:31.910> chemo<00:02:32.300> which

00:02:32.800 --> 00:02:32.810 
cannot wait until we get a chemo which

00:02:32.810 --> 00:02:34.540 
cannot wait until we get a chemo which
hopefully<00:02:33.440> will<00:02:33.710> be<00:02:33.740> in<00:02:33.830> the<00:02:33.950> next<00:02:34.160> month<00:02:34.400> or

00:02:34.540 --> 00:02:34.550 
hopefully will be in the next month or

00:02:34.550 --> 00:02:37.590 
hopefully will be in the next month or
so<00:02:34.580> at<00:02:35.090> the<00:02:35.300> time<00:02:35.840> this<00:02:36.020> review<00:02:36.320> was<00:02:36.380> uploaded

00:02:37.590 --> 00:02:37.600 
so at the time this review was uploaded

00:02:37.600 --> 00:02:40.270 
so at the time this review was uploaded
that<00:02:38.600> will<00:02:38.870> get<00:02:39.080> him<00:02:39.170> and<00:02:39.410> get<00:02:39.620> a<00:02:39.680> variation<00:02:40.190> of

00:02:40.270 --> 00:02:40.280 
that will get him and get a variation of

00:02:40.280 --> 00:02:42.460 
that will get him and get a variation of
this<00:02:40.370> design<00:02:40.760> and<00:02:41.150> I<00:02:41.390> just<00:02:41.630> I've<00:02:41.930> liked<00:02:42.290> it

00:02:42.460 --> 00:02:42.470 
this design and I just I've liked it

00:02:42.470 --> 00:02:45.700 
this design and I just I've liked it
like<00:02:43.280> just<00:02:44.120> move<00:02:44.330> this<00:02:44.510> around<00:02:44.660> and<00:02:45.410> all<00:02:45.590> the

00:02:45.700 --> 00:02:45.710 
like just move this around and all the

00:02:45.710 --> 00:02:48.100 
like just move this around and all the
armor<00:02:45.980> is<00:02:46.070> there<00:02:46.330> interesting<00:02:47.330> little<00:02:47.900> bit

00:02:48.100 --> 00:02:48.110 
armor is there interesting little bit

00:02:48.110 --> 00:02:49.870 
armor is there interesting little bit
here<00:02:48.320> is<00:02:48.410> that<00:02:48.560> that's<00:02:48.710> just<00:02:48.800> a<00:02:49.220> normal<00:02:49.340> bit<00:02:49.760> of

00:02:49.870 --> 00:02:49.880 
here is that that's just a normal bit of

00:02:49.880 --> 00:02:51.040 
here is that that's just a normal bit of
red<00:02:50.030> armor<00:02:50.360> there<00:02:50.570> instead<00:02:50.810> of<00:02:50.930> it<00:02:51.020> being

00:02:51.040 --> 00:02:51.050 
red armor there instead of it being

00:02:51.050 --> 00:02:54.610 
red armor there instead of it being
trans<00:02:51.500> colored<00:02:51.860> I<00:02:53.020> think<00:02:54.020> that<00:02:54.200> works<00:02:54.380> out<00:02:54.560> a

00:02:54.610 --> 00:02:54.620 
trans colored I think that works out a

00:02:54.620 --> 00:02:56.710 
trans colored I think that works out a
lot<00:02:54.950> I<00:02:55.160> think<00:02:55.220> it<00:02:55.610> matches<00:02:55.820> up<00:02:56.210> with<00:02:56.360> the<00:02:56.540> red

00:02:56.710 --> 00:02:56.720 
lot I think it matches up with the red

00:02:56.720 --> 00:03:00.000 
lot I think it matches up with the red
on<00:02:56.870> the<00:02:57.020> fit<00:02:57.170> on<00:02:57.290> the<00:02:57.410> mask<00:02:57.620> and<00:02:57.920> the<00:02:58.040> red<00:02:58.190> there

00:03:00.000 --> 00:03:00.010 
on the fit on the mask and the red there

00:03:00.010 --> 00:03:03.370 
on the fit on the mask and the red there
although<00:03:01.010> if<00:03:01.820> I<00:03:02.060> if<00:03:02.240> I<00:03:02.330> stare<00:03:02.840> at<00:03:02.870> it<00:03:03.200> a<00:03:03.260> little

00:03:03.370 --> 00:03:03.380 
although if I if I stare at it a little

00:03:03.380 --> 00:03:04.240 
although if I if I stare at it a little
bit<00:03:03.560> longer

00:03:04.240 --> 00:03:04.250 
bit longer

00:03:04.250 --> 00:03:07.090 
bit longer
I<00:03:04.810> feel<00:03:05.810> like<00:03:05.960> there's<00:03:06.140> a<00:03:06.200> little<00:03:06.740> bit<00:03:07.070> of

00:03:07.090 --> 00:03:07.100 
I feel like there's a little bit of

00:03:07.100 --> 00:03:08.980 
I feel like there's a little bit of
discoloration<00:03:07.580> like<00:03:08.330> this<00:03:08.570> one's<00:03:08.780> a<00:03:08.870> little

00:03:08.980 --> 00:03:08.990 
discoloration like this one's a little

00:03:08.990 --> 00:03:12.180 
discoloration like this one's a little
bit<00:03:09.230> brighter<00:03:10.030> that<00:03:11.030> may<00:03:11.150> just<00:03:11.330> be<00:03:11.420> um<00:03:11.750> the

00:03:12.180 --> 00:03:12.190 
bit brighter that may just be um the

00:03:12.190 --> 00:03:14.170 
bit brighter that may just be um the
mixing<00:03:13.190> of<00:03:13.280> the<00:03:13.370> plastics<00:03:13.790> in<00:03:13.910> the<00:03:13.940> mask

00:03:14.170 --> 00:03:14.180 
mixing of the plastics in the mask

00:03:14.180 --> 00:03:15.790 
mixing of the plastics in the mask
probably<00:03:14.840> just<00:03:14.960> me<00:03:15.050> being<00:03:15.200> crazy<00:03:15.440> with<00:03:15.710> my

00:03:15.790 --> 00:03:15.800 
probably just me being crazy with my

00:03:15.800 --> 00:03:18.640 
probably just me being crazy with my
eyes<00:03:16.120> but<00:03:17.120> yeah<00:03:17.630> I<00:03:17.660> love<00:03:17.990> this<00:03:18.110> chest<00:03:18.380> design<00:03:18.620> I

00:03:18.640 --> 00:03:18.650 
eyes but yeah I love this chest design I

00:03:18.650 --> 00:03:20.440 
eyes but yeah I love this chest design I
think<00:03:18.740> it's<00:03:18.950> really<00:03:19.160> cool<00:03:19.340> and<00:03:19.580> the<00:03:19.790> back<00:03:20.270> of

00:03:20.440 --> 00:03:20.450 
think it's really cool and the back of

00:03:20.450 --> 00:03:24.640 
think it's really cool and the back of
it<00:03:20.630> I<00:03:20.870> think<00:03:22.090> the<00:03:23.090> way<00:03:23.120> it's<00:03:23.720> connected<00:03:24.470> is

00:03:24.640 --> 00:03:24.650 
it I think the way it's connected is

00:03:24.650 --> 00:03:27.460 
it I think the way it's connected is
super<00:03:25.070> simple<00:03:25.450> super<00:03:26.450> simple<00:03:26.990> in<00:03:27.110> terms<00:03:27.320> of

00:03:27.460 --> 00:03:27.470 
super simple super simple in terms of

00:03:27.470 --> 00:03:29.680 
super simple super simple in terms of
how<00:03:27.560> it's<00:03:27.709> made<00:03:28.000> or<00:03:29.000> you<00:03:29.150> can<00:03:29.270> just<00:03:29.450> pop<00:03:29.660> that

00:03:29.680 --> 00:03:29.690 
how it's made or you can just pop that

00:03:29.690 --> 00:03:33.699 
how it's made or you can just pop that
off<00:03:29.900> and<00:03:30.940> then<00:03:31.940> there's<00:03:32.390> this<00:03:32.600> actual<00:03:33.080> arm

00:03:33.699 --> 00:03:33.709 
off and then there's this actual arm

00:03:33.709 --> 00:03:36.880 
off and then there's this actual arm
assembly<00:03:34.510> like<00:03:35.510> bunch<00:03:36.020> of<00:03:36.140> new<00:03:36.260> parts<00:03:36.560> used<00:03:36.740> in

00:03:36.880 --> 00:03:36.890 
assembly like bunch of new parts used in

00:03:36.890 --> 00:03:38.380 
assembly like bunch of new parts used in
there<00:03:37.040> to<00:03:37.160> make<00:03:37.310> a<00:03:37.340> really<00:03:37.700> cool-looking<00:03:37.940> set

00:03:38.380 --> 00:03:38.390 
there to make a really cool-looking set

00:03:38.390 --> 00:03:43.600 
there to make a really cool-looking set
of<00:03:38.480> arms<00:03:39.070> which<00:03:41.020> if<00:03:42.020> I<00:03:42.230> had<00:03:42.260> um<00:03:42.680> any<00:03:43.280> major

00:03:43.600 --> 00:03:43.610 
of arms which if I had um any major

00:03:43.610 --> 00:03:45.040 
of arms which if I had um any major
complaints<00:03:44.090> with<00:03:44.209> this<00:03:44.300> guy<00:03:44.420> is<00:03:44.480> that<00:03:44.750> I<00:03:44.780> think

00:03:46.930 --> 00:03:46.940 
his shoulders are a little too wide then

00:03:46.940 --> 00:03:49.210 
his shoulders are a little too wide then
again<00:03:47.180> his<00:03:47.300> chest<00:03:47.540> is<00:03:47.720> really<00:03:47.930> wide<00:03:48.110> so<00:03:48.380> I<00:03:48.709> it's

00:03:52.940 --> 00:03:54.730 
okay I mean if anything I wish there was
some<00:03:53.180> sort<00:03:53.330> of<00:03:53.450> armor<00:03:53.750> covering<00:03:54.350> up<00:03:54.470> this

00:03:54.730 --> 00:03:54.740 
some sort of armor covering up this

00:03:54.740 --> 00:03:57.190 
some sort of armor covering up this
little<00:03:55.010> gap<00:03:55.280> there<00:03:55.310> I<00:03:55.910> mean<00:03:56.540> it's<00:03:56.900> not<00:03:56.990> on<00:03:57.110> the

00:03:57.190 --> 00:03:57.200 
little gap there I mean it's not on the

little gap there I mean it's not on the
other<00:03:57.230> side<00:03:57.530> because<00:03:57.740> you<00:03:57.830> have<00:03:57.980> the<00:03:58.580> blaster

00:03:58.990 --> 00:03:59.000

00:04:03.650 --> 00:04:05.680 
there was something to kind of just
cover<00:04:04.250> that<00:04:04.430> up<00:04:04.490> and<00:04:05.120> make<00:04:05.330> it<00:04:05.420> look<00:04:05.540> a<00:04:05.600> little

00:04:05.680 --> 00:04:05.690 
cover that up and make it look a little

00:04:05.690 --> 00:04:07.660 
cover that up and make it look a little
bit<00:04:05.870> better<00:04:05.990> and<00:04:06.560> now<00:04:07.040> for<00:04:07.220> the<00:04:07.280> other<00:04:07.400> major

00:04:07.660 --> 00:04:07.670 
bit better and now for the other major

00:04:07.670 --> 00:04:09.160 
bit better and now for the other major
complaint<00:04:08.090> people<00:04:08.180> have<00:04:08.330> with<00:04:08.600> this<00:04:08.690> guy<00:04:08.870> are

00:04:09.160 --> 00:04:09.170 
complaint people have with this guy are

00:04:09.170 --> 00:04:12.580 
complaint people have with this guy are
his<00:04:09.410> arms<00:04:09.590> because<00:04:10.190> he<00:04:10.280> has<00:04:10.459> no<00:04:10.670> elbows<00:04:11.410> at<00:04:12.410> all

00:04:12.580 --> 00:04:12.590 
his arms because he has no elbows at all

00:04:12.590 --> 00:04:15.729 
his arms because he has no elbows at all
he<00:04:12.830> has<00:04:13.040> a<00:04:13.720> shoulder<00:04:14.720> movement<00:04:15.110> and<00:04:15.290> a<00:04:15.440> wrist

00:04:15.729 --> 00:04:15.739 
he has a shoulder movement and a wrist

00:04:15.739 --> 00:04:17.560 
he has a shoulder movement and a wrist
that<00:04:16.580> is<00:04:16.640> pretty<00:04:17.060> much<00:04:17.239> it

00:04:17.560 --> 00:04:17.570 
that is pretty much it

00:04:17.570 --> 00:04:20.110 
that is pretty much it
and<00:04:17.810> again<00:04:18.620> just<00:04:18.890> him<00:04:19.340> looking<00:04:19.730> like<00:04:19.880> this

00:04:20.110 --> 00:04:20.120 
and again just him looking like this

00:04:20.120 --> 00:04:22.659 
and again just him looking like this
without<00:04:20.479> any<00:04:20.600> doing<00:04:21.080> major<00:04:21.260> poses<00:04:21.739> I<00:04:21.890> think<00:04:22.250> he

00:04:22.659 --> 00:04:22.669 
without any doing major poses I think he

00:04:22.669 --> 00:04:25.000 
without any doing major poses I think he
looks<00:04:23.000> in<00:04:23.210> proportion<00:04:23.720> to<00:04:23.750> the<00:04:23.990> type<00:04:24.229> of

00:04:25.000 --> 00:04:25.010 
looks in proportion to the type of

00:04:25.010 --> 00:04:28.960 
looks in proportion to the type of
small<00:04:25.850> little<00:04:26.210> squat<00:04:26.750> doofy<00:04:27.140> man<00:04:27.320> he<00:04:27.500> is<00:04:27.730> but<00:04:28.730> I

00:04:28.960 --> 00:04:28.970 
small little squat doofy man he is but I

00:04:28.970 --> 00:04:31.150 
small little squat doofy man he is but I
know<00:04:29.420> I<00:04:29.570> think<00:04:29.720> I<00:04:29.930> think<00:04:29.960> it's<00:04:30.470> I<00:04:30.830> think<00:04:30.890> it's

00:04:31.150 --> 00:04:31.160 
know I think I think it's I think it's

00:04:31.160 --> 00:04:34.690 
know I think I think it's I think it's
okay<00:04:31.490> it's<00:04:31.760> not<00:04:31.970> it<00:04:32.480> doesn't<00:04:33.160> when<00:04:34.160> I<00:04:34.190> look<00:04:34.580> at

00:04:34.690 --> 00:04:34.700 
okay it's not it doesn't when I look at

00:04:34.700 --> 00:04:36.970 
okay it's not it doesn't when I look at
it<00:04:34.730> it<00:04:34.970> doesn't<00:04:35.270> bother<00:04:35.540> me<00:04:36.020> I<00:04:36.350> think<00:04:36.500> he<00:04:36.830> looks

00:04:36.970 --> 00:04:36.980 
it it doesn't bother me I think he looks

00:04:36.980 --> 00:04:37.900 
it it doesn't bother me I think he looks
perfectly<00:04:37.370> okay

00:04:37.900 --> 00:04:37.910 
perfectly okay

00:04:37.910 --> 00:04:40.810 
perfectly okay
I<00:04:37.940> think<00:04:38.360> his<00:04:38.450> weapons<00:04:38.750> are<00:04:38.900> goofy<00:04:39.290> as<00:04:39.410> hell<00:04:39.820> so

00:04:40.810 --> 00:04:40.820 
I think his weapons are goofy as hell so

00:04:40.820 --> 00:04:43.870 
I think his weapons are goofy as hell so
if<00:04:40.940> I'm<00:04:41.090> going<00:04:41.270> to<00:04:41.510> assume<00:04:42.190> these<00:04:43.190> fire<00:04:43.580> blades

00:04:43.870 --> 00:04:43.880 
if I'm going to assume these fire blades

00:04:43.880 --> 00:04:46.540 
if I'm going to assume these fire blades
aren't<00:04:44.390> always<00:04:44.570> out<00:04:44.960> like<00:04:45.350> he<00:04:45.560> projects<00:04:46.250> them

00:04:46.540 --> 00:04:46.550 
aren't always out like he projects them

00:04:46.550 --> 00:04:49.420 
aren't always out like he projects them
like<00:04:46.850> fire<00:04:47.350> so<00:04:48.350> I'm<00:04:48.500> assuming<00:04:48.770> that<00:04:49.010> this

00:04:49.420 --> 00:04:49.430 
like fire so I'm assuming that this

00:04:49.430 --> 00:04:50.770 
like fire so I'm assuming that this
right<00:04:49.670> here<00:04:49.700> is<00:04:49.940> the<00:04:50.090> actual<00:04:50.330> weapon<00:04:50.600> and<00:04:50.690> this

00:04:50.770 --> 00:04:50.780 
right here is the actual weapon and this

00:04:50.780 --> 00:04:54.060 
right here is the actual weapon and this
is<00:04:50.870> the<00:04:50.990> fire<00:04:51.200> that's<00:04:51.410> being<00:04:51.650> projected<00:04:52.460> out

00:04:54.060 --> 00:04:54.070 
is the fire that's being projected out

00:04:54.070 --> 00:04:58.450 
is the fire that's being projected out
it<00:04:55.070> just<00:04:55.340> doesn't<00:04:55.700> seem<00:04:55.850> practical<00:04:56.060> oh<00:04:56.750> I<00:04:57.740> mean

00:04:58.450 --> 00:04:58.460 
it just doesn't seem practical oh I mean

00:04:58.460 --> 00:05:00.460 
it just doesn't seem practical oh I mean
it<00:04:58.850> would<00:04:59.060> make<00:04:59.210> more<00:04:59.420> sense<00:04:59.480> to<00:04:59.960> just<00:05:00.170> like

00:05:00.460 --> 00:05:00.470 
it would make more sense to just like

00:05:00.470 --> 00:05:04.510 
it would make more sense to just like
put<00:05:01.430> it<00:05:01.550> here<00:05:02.210> and<00:05:02.780> make<00:05:03.020> it<00:05:03.170> like<00:05:03.350> a<00:05:03.380> gun<00:05:03.950> saber

00:05:04.510 --> 00:05:04.520 
put it here and make it like a gun saber

00:05:04.520 --> 00:05:07.300 
put it here and make it like a gun saber
thing<00:05:05.030> but<00:05:05.510> I<00:05:05.720> do<00:05:06.110> commend<00:05:06.500> it<00:05:06.650> for<00:05:06.830> being<00:05:07.040> a

00:05:07.300 --> 00:05:07.310 
thing but I do commend it for being a

00:05:07.310 --> 00:05:09.820 
thing but I do commend it for being a
very<00:05:07.850> interesting<00:05:08.360> weapon<00:05:08.900> that<00:05:09.560> you<00:05:09.680> can

00:05:09.820 --> 00:05:09.830 
very interesting weapon that you can

00:05:09.830 --> 00:05:13.000 
very interesting weapon that you can
swivel<00:05:10.370> back<00:05:10.720> and<00:05:11.720> do<00:05:12.200> stuff<00:05:12.440> like<00:05:12.530> that<00:05:12.650> with

00:05:13.000 --> 00:05:13.010 
swivel back and do stuff like that with

00:05:13.010 --> 00:05:16.390 
swivel back and do stuff like that with
it<00:05:14.230> it's<00:05:15.230> okay<00:05:15.500> it's<00:05:15.740> a<00:05:15.860> all<00:05:16.010> right

00:05:16.390 --> 00:05:16.400 
it it's okay it's a all right

00:05:16.400 --> 00:05:19.810 
it it's okay it's a all right
hey<00:05:16.790> it's<00:05:17.420> a<00:05:17.660> all<00:05:18.020> right<00:05:18.500> and<00:05:19.400> then<00:05:19.580> we<00:05:19.670> have

00:05:19.810 --> 00:05:19.820 
hey it's a all right and then we have

00:05:19.820 --> 00:05:23.710 
hey it's a all right and then we have
the<00:05:19.940> blaster<00:05:20.330> which<00:05:21.050> I<00:05:21.380> feel<00:05:22.160> like<00:05:22.390> it's<00:05:23.390> a

00:05:23.710 --> 00:05:23.720 
the blaster which I feel like it's a

00:05:23.720 --> 00:05:25.690 
the blaster which I feel like it's a
non-obtrusive<00:05:24.230> way<00:05:24.740> to<00:05:24.800> have<00:05:25.070> this<00:05:25.250> blaster

00:05:25.690 --> 00:05:25.700 
non-obtrusive way to have this blaster

00:05:25.700 --> 00:05:29.380 
non-obtrusive way to have this blaster
on<00:05:25.850> here<00:05:26.150> I<00:05:26.300> think<00:05:26.840> it's<00:05:26.960> very<00:05:27.140> cool<00:05:27.880> I<00:05:28.880> think

00:05:29.380 --> 00:05:29.390 
on here I think it's very cool I think

00:05:29.390 --> 00:05:31.420 
on here I think it's very cool I think
the<00:05:29.540> fact<00:05:29.750> that<00:05:29.900> you<00:05:29.990> can<00:05:30.200> just<00:05:30.500> do<00:05:31.010> this<00:05:31.190> and

00:05:31.420 --> 00:05:31.430 
the fact that you can just do this and

00:05:31.430 --> 00:05:33.280 
the fact that you can just do this and
hide<00:05:31.640> it<00:05:31.730> away<00:05:31.820> on<00:05:32.060> his<00:05:32.180> back<00:05:32.360> clicky<00:05:32.780> like<00:05:33.200> it

00:05:33.280 --> 00:05:33.290 
hide it away on his back clicky like it

00:05:33.290 --> 00:05:34.600 
hide it away on his back clicky like it
was<00:05:33.410> shown<00:05:33.590> in<00:05:33.710> the<00:05:33.770> animation<00:05:33.800> like<00:05:34.430> I<00:05:34.460> think

00:05:34.600 --> 00:05:34.610 
was shown in the animation like I think

00:05:34.610 --> 00:05:35.980 
was shown in the animation like I think
that's<00:05:34.940> a<00:05:35.030> cool<00:05:35.210> way<00:05:35.270> to<00:05:35.330> just<00:05:35.510> to<00:05:35.600> get<00:05:35.750> it<00:05:35.870> out

00:05:35.980 --> 00:05:35.990 
that's a cool way to just to get it out

00:05:35.990 --> 00:05:37.600 
that's a cool way to just to get it out
of<00:05:36.020> the<00:05:36.140> way<00:05:36.260> make<00:05:36.500> it<00:05:36.530> an<00:05:36.740> optional<00:05:37.070> piece<00:05:37.310> of

00:05:37.600 --> 00:05:37.610 
of the way make it an optional piece of

00:05:37.610 --> 00:05:41.560 
of the way make it an optional piece of
weaponry<00:05:37.760> I<00:05:38.740> think<00:05:39.740> this<00:05:39.830> is<00:05:39.950> the<00:05:40.100> mmm<00:05:40.820> no<00:05:41.360> it's

00:05:41.560 --> 00:05:41.570 
weaponry I think this is the mmm no it's

00:05:41.570 --> 00:05:43.210 
weaponry I think this is the mmm no it's
not<00:05:41.630> the<00:05:41.780> best<00:05:41.990> implementation<00:05:42.740> of<00:05:42.890> the

00:05:43.210 --> 00:05:43.220 
not the best implementation of the

00:05:43.220 --> 00:05:45.160 
not the best implementation of the
weapon<00:05:43.520> because<00:05:44.000> I<00:05:44.030> think<00:05:44.360> putting<00:05:44.630> it<00:05:44.810> in<00:05:44.930> the

00:05:45.160 --> 00:05:45.170 
weapon because I think putting it in the

00:05:45.170 --> 00:05:47.020 
weapon because I think putting it in the
protector<00:05:45.710> of<00:05:45.800> Earth<00:05:45.920> chest<00:05:46.430> I<00:05:46.610> thought<00:05:46.880> was

00:05:47.020 --> 00:05:47.030 
protector of Earth chest I thought was

00:05:47.030 --> 00:05:50.890 
protector of Earth chest I thought was
really<00:05:47.210> cool<00:05:47.830> but<00:05:48.830> here<00:05:49.330> making<00:05:50.330> it<00:05:50.390> the<00:05:50.540> exact

00:05:50.890 --> 00:05:50.900 
really cool but here making it the exact

00:05:50.900 --> 00:05:53.560 
really cool but here making it the exact
opposite<00:05:51.410> of<00:05:51.560> his<00:05:51.740> where<00:05:52.010> it's<00:05:52.250> optional<00:05:52.940> it's

00:05:53.560 --> 00:05:53.570 
opposite of his where it's optional it's

00:05:53.570 --> 00:05:55.000 
opposite of his where it's optional it's
not<00:05:53.750> built<00:05:53.960> into<00:05:54.140> the<00:05:54.230> body<00:05:54.350> it's<00:05:54.530> an<00:05:54.590> optional

00:05:55.000 --> 00:05:55.010 
not built into the body it's an optional

00:05:55.010 --> 00:05:57.670 
not built into the body it's an optional
piece<00:05:55.160> of<00:05:55.310> armor<00:05:55.610> not<00:05:56.180> armor<00:05:56.480> of<00:05:56.600> weaponry<00:05:57.020> you

00:05:57.670 --> 00:05:57.680

00:05:57.680 --> 00:06:00.070 
piece of armor not armor of weaponry you
can<00:05:57.800> just<00:05:57.950> pull<00:05:58.130> off<00:05:58.280> so<00:05:58.610> easily<00:05:58.820> like<00:05:59.480> I<00:05:59.720> think

00:06:00.070 --> 00:06:00.080 
can just pull off so easily like I think

00:06:00.080 --> 00:06:01.410 
can just pull off so easily like I think
just<00:06:00.260> have<00:06:00.380> them<00:06:00.500> look<00:06:00.620> like<00:06:00.740> a<00:06:00.770> normal<00:06:01.070> dude

00:06:01.410 --> 00:06:01.420 
just have them look like a normal dude

00:06:01.420 --> 00:06:04.540 
just have them look like a normal dude
his<00:06:02.420> mask<00:06:02.690> is<00:06:02.900> okay<00:06:03.200> I<00:06:03.440> think<00:06:03.620> again<00:06:04.250> I<00:06:04.310> like

00:06:04.540 --> 00:06:04.550 
his mask is okay I think again I like

00:06:04.550 --> 00:06:06.160 
his mask is okay I think again I like
the<00:06:04.760> design<00:06:05.030> of<00:06:05.090> it<00:06:05.300> I<00:06:05.480> think<00:06:05.660> the<00:06:05.780> colors<00:06:06.020> are

00:06:06.160 --> 00:06:06.170 
the design of it I think the colors are

00:06:06.170 --> 00:06:11.920 
the design of it I think the colors are
all<00:06:06.350> right<00:06:06.620> um<00:06:07.220> I<00:06:08.290> don't<00:06:09.290> know<00:06:09.470> I<00:06:09.890> just<00:06:10.280> I<00:06:10.970> like

00:06:11.920 --> 00:06:11.930 
all right um I don't know I just I like

00:06:11.930 --> 00:06:15.340 
all right um I don't know I just I like
it<00:06:12.110> the<00:06:12.230> way<00:06:12.260> this<00:06:12.560> guy<00:06:12.800> looks<00:06:13.130> a<00:06:13.520> lot<00:06:14.330> but<00:06:15.170> if

00:06:15.340 --> 00:06:15.350 
it the way this guy looks a lot but if

00:06:15.350 --> 00:06:16.480 
it the way this guy looks a lot but if
you<00:06:15.440> try<00:06:15.620> to<00:06:15.680> pose<00:06:15.860> him<00:06:16.100> and<00:06:16.220> put<00:06:16.310> him<00:06:16.400> in

00:06:16.480 --> 00:06:16.490 
you try to pose him and put him in

00:06:16.490 --> 00:06:17.740 
you try to pose him and put him in
action<00:06:16.640> pose<00:06:16.940> it<00:06:17.090> doesn't<00:06:17.300> really<00:06:17.390> work<00:06:17.570> out

00:06:17.740 --> 00:06:17.750 
action pose it doesn't really work out

00:06:17.750 --> 00:06:19.570 
action pose it doesn't really work out

00:06:48.330 --> 00:06:48.340 
next to the protector of Earth which are

00:06:48.340 --> 00:06:50.490 
next to the protector of Earth which are
both<00:06:48.490> very<00:06:48.730> similar<00:06:49.000> and<00:06:49.330> build<00:06:49.510> the<00:06:50.170> only

00:06:50.490 --> 00:06:50.500 
both very similar and build the only

00:06:50.500 --> 00:06:52.110 
both very similar and build the only
reason<00:06:50.710> why<00:06:50.830> the<00:06:50.890> earth<00:06:51.070> guy<00:06:51.310> wins<00:06:51.610> is<00:06:51.850> because

00:06:52.110 --> 00:06:52.120 
reason why the earth guy wins is because

00:06:52.120 --> 00:06:54.240 
reason why the earth guy wins is because
he<00:06:52.210> has<00:06:52.330> better<00:06:52.510> colors<00:06:52.900> and<00:06:53.170> a<00:06:53.710> little<00:06:54.130> bit

00:06:54.240 --> 00:06:54.250 
he has better colors and a little bit

00:06:54.250 --> 00:06:57.420 
he has better colors and a little bit
more<00:06:54.400> pose<00:06:54.610> ability<00:06:55.090> but<00:06:55.960> overall<00:06:56.530> I<00:06:56.920> like<00:06:57.280> the

00:06:57.420 --> 00:06:57.430 
more pose ability but overall I like the

00:06:57.430 --> 00:06:59.100 
more pose ability but overall I like the
way<00:06:57.520> the<00:06:57.610> protector<00:06:57.910> for<00:06:58.060> fire<00:06:58.210> looks<00:06:58.510> I<00:06:58.810> think

00:06:59.100 --> 00:06:59.110 
way the protector for fire looks I think

00:06:59.110 --> 00:07:01.770 
way the protector for fire looks I think
he<00:06:59.200> has<00:06:59.290> some<00:06:59.410> pretty<00:06:59.590> decent<00:06:59.800> parts<00:07:00.750> and<00:07:01.750> I

00:07:01.770 --> 00:07:01.780 
he has some pretty decent parts and I

00:07:01.780 --> 00:07:03.480 
he has some pretty decent parts and I
think<00:07:02.170> he's<00:07:02.290> a<00:07:02.320> pretty<00:07:02.560> decent<00:07:02.650> action<00:07:03.190> figure

00:07:03.480 --> 00:07:03.490 
think he's a pretty decent action figure

00:07:03.490 --> 00:07:06.450 
think he's a pretty decent action figure
so<00:07:04.300> yeah<00:07:04.690> this<00:07:04.990> is<00:07:05.050> shadow<00:07:05.320> gear<00:07:05.500> 655<00:07:06.130> I<00:07:06.310> hope

00:07:06.450 --> 00:07:06.460 
so yeah this is shadow gear 655 I hope

00:07:06.460 --> 00:07:08.160 
so yeah this is shadow gear 655 I hope
