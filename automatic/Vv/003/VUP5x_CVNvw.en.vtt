00:00:00.689 --> 00:00:03.340
 After introducing the ia server 

00:00:03.340 --> 00:00:06.040
 Atlas has a faq 

00:00:06.040 --> 00:00:08.059
 It spread throughout the whole country 

00:00:08.059 --> 00:00:11.089
 There are many Thai men who have been postponed 

00:00:11.089 --> 00:00:15.019
 If it is the case, the comparison resumes from the US dollar 

00:00:15.019 --> 00:00:17.519
 Takeda city was reached in Afghanistan 

00:00:17.519 --> 00:00:19.759
 Dam is very significant 

00:00:19.759 --> 00:00:22.710
 ap co 

00:00:22.710 --> 00:00:25.949
 It's been a while since it's been new again 2 times lost 

00:00:26.899 --> 00:00:30.109
 The stories themselves are nice to each other there 

00:00:30.789 --> 00:00:32.420
 In that 

00:00:32.420 --> 00:00:34.260
 Twelve 29 can be done 

00:00:34.260 --> 00:00:38.320
 The euro remains in a modest price movement against the dollar 

00:00:38.320 --> 00:00:39.760
 segar 

00:00:39.760 --> 00:00:42.800
 After that I looked for a figure that would make me run up 

00:00:44.740 --> 00:00:48.130
 That's it, but it is said that we have an appointment in Atlas 

00:00:48.130 --> 00:00:51.130
 It is 4 rationalization besides this wood grain very much 

00:00:53.650 --> 00:00:55.480
 Such a little bit 

00:00:55.480 --> 00:00:58.380
 A little bit 

00:00:58.380 --> 00:01:01.380
 I think it is two things to participate 

00:01:04.380 --> 00:01:07.300
 On the other hand I got a little closer 

00:01:07.300 --> 00:01:10.300
 Shall I ask you to do this? 

00:01:11.890 --> 00:01:14.890
 Where did you die 

00:01:18.450 --> 00:01:22.190
 But for the sleeping kid talking if you can make a move 

00:01:22.190 --> 00:01:23.030
 is not it 

00:01:23.030 --> 00:01:25.650
 I will have tears at school 

00:01:25.650 --> 00:01:28.540
 It's kinda like this and it's a little wonderful 

00:01:28.540 --> 00:01:29.860
 I think 

00:01:29.860 --> 00:01:30.970
 after 

00:01:30.970 --> 00:01:33.170
 This music stand is by all means 

00:01:33.170 --> 00:01:36.170
 Ema is one dollar and seven yuan 

00:01:37.360 --> 00:01:42.450
 Takechi Hironori that a man can be made year by year and it is worse for two people 

00:01:43.560 --> 00:01:48.050
 Once you have Matsuura in the United States, there is Apollo but the Buddha of the surface 

00:01:48.049 --> 00:01:51.260
 It's just that I'm from here to here 

00:01:51.260 --> 00:01:53.250
 Heart 

00:01:53.250 --> 00:01:56.940
 Because it is the direction to see everything from end to end, it is an adult boy open 

00:01:56.940 --> 00:02:01.320
 Large tax amount pasted with a little copied US soldier 

00:02:01.320 --> 00:02:05.500
 It's really easy to use pr 

00:02:05.500 --> 00:02:08.689
 I always think this is an idea 

00:02:08.689 --> 00:02:11.849
 You look at your back like a child 

00:02:11.849 --> 00:02:15.089
 Occasionally, it's beautiful, it's Takeda 

00:02:15.089 --> 00:02:18.449
 I also think that it is a position like the middle of September 

00:02:18.449 --> 00:02:22.579
 And one more surprise is that the echter program is not full 

00:02:22.579 --> 00:02:25.959
 It's up to the backyard, but I've done this painting for me 

00:02:25.959 --> 00:02:26.739
 Runn 

00:02:26.739 --> 00:02:31.749
 This is a village where the effector vacationers give the target total strength 

00:02:31.749 --> 00:02:34.249
 I'm about to take my hand, but I'm not worth it until here 

00:02:34.249 --> 00:02:38.760
 Mr. Ikakata who is very surprised at this craftsman's garden tip 

00:02:38.760 --> 00:02:39.929
 came 

00:02:39.929 --> 00:02:42.289
 There is no break 

00:02:42.289 --> 00:02:45.289
 Then turn your mind 

00:03:09.089 --> 00:03:13.259
 Ayako Hatta I've done it, and then I'm going to power in Colombia 

00:03:13.259 --> 00:03:15.309
 Exceed 

00:03:15.309 --> 00:03:18.449
 Wearers are also keywords such as Kandagawa
