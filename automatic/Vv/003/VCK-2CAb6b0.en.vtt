hey guys I'm back so as you can tell
this<00:03:53.450> PC<00:03:53.780> performs<00:03:54.230> pretty<00:03:54.440> well<00:03:54.740> in<00:03:54.800> this

00:03:54.910 --> 00:03:54.920 
this PC performs pretty well in this

00:03:54.920 --> 00:03:56.500 
this PC performs pretty well in this
game<00:03:55.010> although<00:03:55.370> I<00:03:55.670> must<00:03:55.880> admit<00:03:56.030> it<00:03:56.330> the

00:03:56.500 --> 00:03:56.510 
game although I must admit it the

00:03:56.510 --> 00:03:58.540 
game although I must admit it the
struggle<00:03:56.840> and<00:03:57.080> occasionally<00:03:57.770> dip<00:03:57.920> below<00:03:58.190> 30

00:03:58.540 --> 00:03:58.550 
struggle and occasionally dip below 30

00:03:58.550 --> 00:04:01.600 
struggle and occasionally dip below 30
but<00:03:59.210> as<00:03:59.360> I<00:03:59.510> said<00:03:59.570> before<00:03:59.720> it<00:04:00.680> usually<00:04:01.160> holds

00:04:01.600 --> 00:04:01.610 
but as I said before it usually holds

00:04:01.610 --> 00:04:04.600 
but as I said before it usually holds
that<00:04:01.760> 30-plus<00:04:02.570> around<00:04:03.380> the<00:04:03.470> 40<00:04:03.800> FPS<00:04:04.310> range

00:04:04.600 --> 00:04:04.610 
that 30-plus around the 40 FPS range

00:04:04.610 --> 00:04:07.090 
that 30-plus around the 40 FPS range
which<00:04:05.450> i<00:04:05.600> think<00:04:05.660> is<00:04:05.930> pretty<00:04:06.200> awesome<00:04:06.260> as<00:04:06.800> I've

00:04:07.090 --> 00:04:07.100 
which i think is pretty awesome as I've

00:04:07.100 --> 00:04:09.580 
which i think is pretty awesome as I've
told<00:04:07.280> you<00:04:07.400> before<00:04:07.460> I<00:04:07.790> picked<00:04:08.090> us<00:04:08.210> up<00:04:08.300> for<00:04:08.590> $830

00:04:09.580 --> 00:04:09.590 
told you before I picked us up for $830

00:04:09.590 --> 00:04:11.830 
told you before I picked us up for $830
and<00:04:09.860> they<00:04:10.280> could<00:04:10.400> perform<00:04:10.760> these<00:04:10.940> hides<00:04:11.240> ultra

00:04:11.830 --> 00:04:11.840 
and they could perform these hides ultra

00:04:11.840 --> 00:04:14.470 
and they could perform these hides ultra
settings<00:04:12.350> at<00:04:12.740> a<00:04:12.830> 30-plus<00:04:13.370> fps<00:04:14.000> in<00:04:14.150> just<00:04:14.300> about

every game I've thrown at it and I think

00:04:15.950 --> 00:04:18.070 
every game I've thrown at it and I think
that's<00:04:16.220> really<00:04:16.730> awesome<00:04:16.930> besides<00:04:17.930> that<00:04:18.050> I

00:04:18.070 --> 00:04:18.080
