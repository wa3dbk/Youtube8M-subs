00:00:06.430 --> 00:00:09.129 

so<00:00:07.430> now<00:00:07.640> the<00:00:07.700> intercooler<00:00:08.269> is<00:00:08.450> secured

00:00:09.129 --> 00:00:09.139 
so now the intercooler is secured

00:00:09.139 --> 00:00:11.289 
so now the intercooler is secured
another<00:00:10.100> thing<00:00:10.520> that<00:00:10.700> you'll<00:00:10.820> want<00:00:11.059> to<00:00:11.120> make

00:00:11.289 --> 00:00:11.299 
another thing that you'll want to make

00:00:11.299 --> 00:00:13.629 
another thing that you'll want to make
motive<00:00:11.750> is<00:00:11.990> these<00:00:12.350> two<00:00:12.590> brackets<00:00:13.070> here<00:00:13.309> these

00:00:13.629 --> 00:00:13.639 
motive is these two brackets here these

00:00:13.639 --> 00:00:15.669 
motive is these two brackets here these
are<00:00:13.790> designed<00:00:14.150> to<00:00:14.330> hold<00:00:15.110> the<00:00:15.230> stock<00:00:15.410> fan

00:00:15.669 --> 00:00:15.679 
are designed to hold the stock fan

00:00:15.679 --> 00:00:17.920 
are designed to hold the stock fan
shroud<00:00:15.889> so<00:00:16.279> because<00:00:17.180> we<00:00:17.300> want<00:00:17.390> that<00:00:17.599> as<00:00:17.720> close

00:00:17.920 --> 00:00:17.930 
shroud so because we want that as close

00:00:17.930 --> 00:00:19.929 
shroud so because we want that as close
to<00:00:18.050> the<00:00:18.140> intercooler<00:00:18.410> as<00:00:18.590> possible<00:00:19.279> so<00:00:19.790> we

00:00:19.929 --> 00:00:19.939 
to the intercooler as possible so we

00:00:19.939 --> 00:00:21.220 
to the intercooler as possible so we
don't<00:00:19.970> have<00:00:20.210> any<00:00:20.360> air<00:00:20.540> leaks<00:00:20.779> running<00:00:21.140> around

00:00:21.220 --> 00:00:21.230 
don't have any air leaks running around

00:00:21.230 --> 00:00:22.840 
don't have any air leaks running around
it<00:00:21.560> and<00:00:22.070> now<00:00:22.250> with<00:00:22.430> the<00:00:22.550> intercooler

00:00:22.840 --> 00:00:22.850 
it and now with the intercooler

00:00:22.850 --> 00:00:25.179 
it and now with the intercooler
installed<00:00:23.390> you'll<00:00:23.900> also<00:00:24.140> see<00:00:24.619> that<00:00:24.650> the<00:00:24.949> front

00:00:25.179 --> 00:00:25.189 
installed you'll also see that the front

00:00:25.189 --> 00:00:27.970 
installed you'll also see that the front
of<00:00:25.310> it<00:00:25.400> clears<00:00:25.640> the<00:00:25.850> bumper<00:00:26.180> just<00:00:26.449> fine<00:00:26.980> put

00:00:27.970 --> 00:00:27.980 
of it clears the bumper just fine put

00:00:27.980 --> 00:00:30.130 
of it clears the bumper just fine put
the<00:00:28.130> two<00:00:28.340> edges<00:00:28.550> where<00:00:29.330> you<00:00:29.449> had<00:00:29.599> to<00:00:29.720> pull<00:00:29.930> down

00:00:30.130 --> 00:00:30.140 
the two edges where you had to pull down

00:00:30.140 --> 00:00:32.220 
the two edges where you had to pull down
is<00:00:30.380> where<00:00:30.830> the<00:00:31.189> bumper<00:00:31.490> would<00:00:31.609> hit<00:00:31.760> the

00:00:32.220 --> 00:00:32.230 
is where the bumper would hit the

00:00:32.230 --> 00:00:35.680 
is where the bumper would hit the
intercooler<00:00:33.230> in<00:00:33.559> the<00:00:34.010> install<00:00:34.550> process<00:00:34.820> so

00:00:35.680 --> 00:00:35.690 
intercooler in the install process so

00:00:35.690 --> 00:00:39.039 
intercooler in the install process so
now<00:00:35.809> the<00:00:35.870> hoses<00:00:36.470> should<00:00:37.430> be<00:00:37.640> halfway<00:00:38.049> inserted

00:00:39.039 --> 00:00:39.049 
now the hoses should be halfway inserted

00:00:39.049 --> 00:00:42.160 
now the hoses should be halfway inserted
into<00:00:39.699> the<00:00:40.699> quick<00:00:41.269> disconnect<00:00:41.780> couplers

00:00:42.160 --> 00:00:42.170 
into the quick disconnect couplers

00:00:42.170 --> 00:00:45.039 
into the quick disconnect couplers
because<00:00:42.620> if<00:00:43.280> they<00:00:44.000> weren't<00:00:44.210> halfway<00:00:44.570> inserted

00:00:45.039 --> 00:00:45.049 
because if they weren't halfway inserted

00:00:45.049 --> 00:00:46.570 
because if they weren't halfway inserted
there'd<00:00:45.320> be<00:00:45.470> so<00:00:45.650> much<00:00:45.799> pressure<00:00:46.159> that<00:00:46.309> you

00:00:46.570 --> 00:00:46.580 
there'd be so much pressure that you

00:00:46.580 --> 00:00:47.619 
there'd be so much pressure that you
wouldn't<00:00:46.790> be<00:00:46.850> able<00:00:47.000> to<00:00:47.089> push<00:00:47.239> the<00:00:47.390> intercooler

00:00:47.619 --> 00:00:47.629 
wouldn't be able to push the intercooler

00:00:47.629 --> 00:00:49.000 
wouldn't be able to push the intercooler
up<00:00:47.809> there<00:00:47.989> so<00:00:48.379> all<00:00:48.440> you<00:00:48.530> have<00:00:48.650> to<00:00:48.739> do<00:00:48.830> now<00:00:48.979> is

00:00:49.000 --> 00:00:49.010 
up there so all you have to do now is

00:00:49.010 --> 00:00:50.619 
up there so all you have to do now is
grab<00:00:49.280> the<00:00:49.430> hose<00:00:49.580> and<00:00:50.030> they'll<00:00:50.269> snap<00:00:50.449> into

00:00:50.619 --> 00:00:50.629 
grab the hose and they'll snap into

00:00:50.629 --> 00:00:53.590 
grab the hose and they'll snap into
place<00:00:50.869> you'll<00:00:51.019> be<00:00:51.110> able<00:00:51.170> to<00:00:51.290> hear<00:00:51.440> it<00:00:52.600> right

00:00:53.590 --> 00:00:53.600 
place you'll be able to hear it right

00:00:53.600 --> 00:00:56.020 
place you'll be able to hear it right
there<00:00:53.809> there's<00:00:53.989> one<00:00:54.460> and<00:00:55.460> the<00:00:55.699> other<00:00:55.820> side

00:00:56.020 --> 00:00:56.030 
there there's one and the other side

00:00:56.030 --> 00:01:04.380 
there there's one and the other side
here<00:00:56.269> you'll<00:00:56.420> hear<00:00:56.570> it<00:00:56.659> again<00:01:02.710> there<00:01:03.710> it<00:01:03.799> is

00:01:04.380 --> 00:01:04.390 
here you'll hear it again there it is

00:01:04.390 --> 00:01:05.649 
here you'll hear it again there it is
right<00:01:05.390> there

00:01:05.649 --> 00:01:05.659 
right there

00:01:05.659 --> 00:01:08.590 
right there
so<00:01:06.140> the<00:01:06.260> intercooler<00:01:06.590> is<00:01:07.180> installed<00:01:08.180> now<00:01:08.390> all

00:01:08.590 --> 00:01:08.600 
so the intercooler is installed now all

00:01:08.600 --> 00:01:10.210 
so the intercooler is installed now all
we<00:01:08.780> have<00:01:08.900> to<00:01:09.020> do<00:01:09.140> is<00:01:09.290> install<00:01:09.530> our<00:01:09.650> support

now<00:01:52.770> that<00:01:52.980> the<00:01:53.070> brackets<00:01:53.550> are<00:01:53.700> installed<00:01:53.880> all

00:01:54.350 --> 00:01:54.360 
now that the brackets are installed all

00:01:54.360 --> 00:01:57.020 
now that the brackets are installed all
we<00:01:54.540> have<00:01:54.690> to<00:01:54.810> do<00:01:54.990> is<00:01:55.310> reinstall<00:01:56.310> our<00:01:56.610> lower

00:01:57.020 --> 00:01:57.030 
we have to do is reinstall our lower

00:01:57.030 --> 00:02:03.140 
we have to do is reinstall our lower
under<00:01:57.420> tray<00:01:57.690> and<00:01:58.560> we're<00:01:58.680> all<00:01:58.740> set<00:02:01.970> we're<00:02:02.970> ready

00:02:03.150 --> 00:02:04.490 
under tray and we're all set we're ready
to<00:02:03.270> install<00:02:03.450> our<00:02:03.660> under<00:02:04.020> tray<00:02:04.200> what<00:02:04.410> I'll

00:02:04.490 --> 00:02:04.500 
to install our under tray what I'll

00:02:04.500 --> 00:02:06.080 
to install our under tray what I'll
normally<00:02:04.620> do<00:02:04.980> is<00:02:05.130> have<00:02:05.340> one<00:02:05.520> of<00:02:05.610> the<00:02:05.670> fasteners

00:02:06.080 --> 00:02:06.090 
normally do is have one of the fasteners

normally do is have one of the fasteners
in<00:02:06.300> hand<00:02:06.570> so<00:02:06.870> then<00:02:07.830> when<00:02:07.920> I<00:02:07.950> slip<00:02:08.250> the<00:02:08.399> front<00:02:08.610> of

00:02:08.690 --> 00:02:08.700 
in hand so then when I slip the front of

00:02:08.700 --> 00:02:11.570 
in hand so then when I slip the front of
the<00:02:08.760> under<00:02:08.970> tray<00:02:09.119> in<00:02:09.240> there<00:02:09.510> I<00:02:09.720> can<00:02:10.649> put<00:02:11.400> this

00:02:11.570 --> 00:02:11.580 
the under tray in there I can put this

00:02:11.580 --> 00:02:13.670 
the under tray in there I can put this
in<00:02:11.790> one<00:02:11.940> of<00:02:12.060> the<00:02:12.120> rear<00:02:12.510> most<00:02:12.780> mounts<00:02:13.350> and<00:02:13.500> it'll

00:02:13.670 --> 00:02:13.680 
in one of the rear most mounts and it'll

00:02:13.680 --> 00:02:15.350 
in one of the rear most mounts and it'll
basically<00:02:13.800> help<00:02:14.190> you<00:02:14.250> hold<00:02:14.400> it<00:02:14.520> up<00:02:14.580> it

00:02:15.350 --> 00:02:15.360 
basically help you hold it up it

00:02:15.360 --> 00:02:17.300 
basically help you hold it up it
installs<00:02:15.660> exactly<00:02:15.810> the<00:02:16.230> same<00:02:16.410> way<00:02:16.560> except<00:02:16.980> for

00:02:17.300 --> 00:02:17.310 
installs exactly the same way except for

00:02:17.310 --> 00:02:19.400 
installs exactly the same way except for
the<00:02:17.850> intercooler<00:02:18.180> so<00:02:18.480> much<00:02:18.630> larger<00:02:18.870> now<00:02:19.230> that

00:02:19.400 --> 00:02:19.410 
the intercooler so much larger now that

00:02:19.410 --> 00:02:20.420 
the intercooler so much larger now that
we'll<00:02:19.500> have<00:02:19.590> to<00:02:19.680> pull<00:02:19.860> it<00:02:19.920> down<00:02:19.950> on<00:02:20.130> the<00:02:20.190> front

00:02:20.420 --> 00:02:20.430 
we'll have to pull it down on the front

00:02:20.430 --> 00:02:22.280 
we'll have to pull it down on the front
bumper<00:02:20.580> a<00:02:20.730> little<00:02:21.210> bit<00:02:21.390> just<00:02:21.960> to<00:02:22.020> get<00:02:22.140> the

00:02:22.280 --> 00:02:22.290 
bumper a little bit just to get the

00:02:22.290 --> 00:02:25.160 
bumper a little bit just to get the
inter<00:02:22.470> cool<00:02:22.650> just<00:02:23.010> to<00:02:23.100> get<00:02:23.280> the<00:02:23.930> under<00:02:24.930> tray<00:02:25.080> to

00:02:25.160 --> 00:02:25.170 
inter cool just to get the under tray to

00:02:25.170 --> 00:02:26.780 
inter cool just to get the under tray to
slip<00:02:25.500> in<00:02:25.680> there<00:02:25.830> in<00:02:26.010> between<00:02:26.130> the<00:02:26.400> inner<00:02:26.520> for

00:02:26.780 --> 00:02:26.790 
slip in there in between the inner for

00:02:26.790 --> 00:02:28.730 
slip in there in between the inner for
my<00:02:26.970> upper<00:02:27.150> so<00:02:28.050> that's<00:02:28.200> all<00:02:28.320> I'll<00:02:28.410> go<00:02:28.500> ahead<00:02:28.560> and

00:02:28.730 --> 00:02:28.740 
my upper so that's all I'll go ahead and

00:02:28.740 --> 00:02:34.550 
my upper so that's all I'll go ahead and
do<00:02:28.800> now<00:02:31.070> more<00:02:32.070> than<00:02:32.220> hoping<00:02:32.580> it<00:02:32.670> was<00:02:33.440> there's<00:02:34.440> a

00:02:34.550 --> 00:02:34.560 
do now more than hoping it was there's a

00:02:34.560 --> 00:02:42.260 
do now more than hoping it was there's a
larger<00:02:34.860> inner<00:02:35.070> course<00:02:39.080> we<00:02:40.080> go<00:02:41.030> then<00:02:42.030> like<00:02:42.180> I

00:02:42.260 --> 00:02:42.270 
larger inner course we go then like I

00:02:42.270 --> 00:02:44.330 
larger inner course we go then like I
said<00:02:42.450> before<00:02:42.600> I<00:02:42.810> always<00:02:43.050> have<00:02:43.380> a<00:02:43.590> fastener<00:02:44.190> in

00:02:44.330 --> 00:02:44.340 
said before I always have a fastener in

00:02:44.340 --> 00:02:47.810 
said before I always have a fastener in
hand<00:02:44.840> so<00:02:45.840> all<00:02:46.230> I<00:02:46.290> got<00:02:46.470> to<00:02:46.500> do<00:02:46.650> is<00:02:46.770> wind<00:02:46.980> up<00:02:47.130> one

00:02:47.810 --> 00:02:47.820 
hand so all I got to do is wind up one

00:02:47.820 --> 00:02:51.580 
hand so all I got to do is wind up one
of<00:02:47.940> these<00:02:48.620> in<00:02:49.620> the<00:02:49.740> back<00:02:49.920> here<00:02:50.190> just<00:02:50.400> like<00:02:50.640> that

00:02:51.580 --> 00:02:51.590 
of these in the back here just like that

00:02:51.590 --> 00:02:54.920 
of these in the back here just like that
throw<00:02:52.590> that<00:02:52.770> in<00:02:52.890> there<00:02:53.010> by<00:02:53.190> hand<00:02:53.690> and<00:02:54.690> that

00:02:54.920 --> 00:02:54.930 
throw that in there by hand and that

00:02:54.930 --> 00:02:56.330 
throw that in there by hand and that
basically<00:02:55.320> helps<00:02:55.680> you<00:02:55.770> hold<00:02:55.950> this<00:02:56.190> whole

00:02:56.330 --> 00:02:56.340 
basically helps you hold this whole

00:02:56.340 --> 00:02:58.880 
basically helps you hold this whole
thing<00:02:56.580> up<00:02:56.730> while<00:02:56.970> I<00:02:57.410> insert<00:02:58.410> the<00:02:58.530> rest<00:02:58.680> of<00:02:58.830> the

00:02:58.880 --> 00:02:58.890 
thing up while I insert the rest of the

00:02:58.890 --> 00:03:00.290 
thing up while I insert the rest of the
fastener<00:02:59.310> so<00:02:59.520> I'm<00:02:59.670> going<00:02:59.820> to<00:02:59.880> go<00:02:59.970> ahead<00:03:00.060> and<00:03:00.239> do

00:03:00.290 --> 00:03:00.300 
fastener so I'm going to go ahead and do

00:03:00.300 --> 00:03:02.690 
fastener so I'm going to go ahead and do
that<00:03:00.450> now<00:03:00.690> and<00:03:00.959> that's<00:03:01.920> it<00:03:02.130> that's<00:03:02.310> all<00:03:02.489> where

00:03:02.690 --> 00:03:02.700 
that now and that's it that's all where

00:03:02.700 --> 00:03:07.550 
that now and that's it that's all where
your<00:03:02.820> install<00:03:03.209> right<00:03:03.420> that<00:03:05.870> as<00:03:06.870> you<00:03:07.170> can<00:03:07.320> see

00:03:07.550 --> 00:03:07.560 
your install right that as you can see

00:03:07.560 --> 00:03:10.400 
your install right that as you can see
the<00:03:07.820> stock<00:03:08.820> under<00:03:09.209> trays<00:03:09.480> all<00:03:09.720> fit<00:03:10.080> in<00:03:10.200> there

00:03:10.400 --> 00:03:10.410 
the stock under trays all fit in there

00:03:10.410 --> 00:03:15.199 
the stock under trays all fit in there
perfectly<00:03:11.180> and<00:03:12.180> also<00:03:13.110> the<00:03:14.070> intercoolers<00:03:14.910> is

00:03:15.199 --> 00:03:15.209 
perfectly and also the intercoolers is

00:03:15.209 --> 00:03:19.220 
perfectly and also the intercoolers is
inconspicuous<00:03:15.959> as<00:03:16.560> it<00:03:16.800> was<00:03:17.630> stock<00:03:18.630> so<00:03:18.989> you<00:03:19.050> can

00:03:19.220 --> 00:03:19.230 
inconspicuous as it was stock so you can

00:03:19.230 --> 00:03:22.100 
inconspicuous as it was stock so you can
barely<00:03:19.590> see<00:03:19.830> it<00:03:19.860> and<00:03:20.160> also<00:03:20.630> if<00:03:21.630> you<00:03:21.750> look<00:03:21.930> in

00:03:22.100 --> 00:03:22.110 
barely see it and also if you look in

00:03:22.110 --> 00:03:24.080 
barely see it and also if you look in
there<00:03:22.320> it's<00:03:23.100> kind<00:03:23.220> of<00:03:23.310> hard<00:03:23.489> to<00:03:23.519> see<00:03:23.700> on<00:03:23.730> camera

00:03:24.080 --> 00:03:24.090 
there it's kind of hard to see on camera

00:03:24.090 --> 00:03:28.060 
there it's kind of hard to see on camera
but<00:03:24.510> the<00:03:25.410> inner<00:03:25.590> cooler<00:03:26.010> and<00:03:26.400> the<00:03:27.269> radiator

00:03:28.060 --> 00:03:28.070 
but the inner cooler and the radiator

00:03:28.070 --> 00:03:31.400 
but the inner cooler and the radiator
form<00:03:29.070> a<00:03:29.160> tight<00:03:29.430> seal<00:03:29.820> together<00:03:30.540> just<00:03:31.019> so<00:03:31.230> that

00:03:31.400 --> 00:03:31.410 
form a tight seal together just so that

00:03:31.410 --> 00:03:33.710 
form a tight seal together just so that
there's<00:03:31.620> no<00:03:31.830> air<00:03:31.860> leaks<00:03:32.400> in<00:03:32.640> between<00:03:33.600> the

00:03:33.710 --> 00:03:33.720 
there's no air leaks in between the

00:03:33.720 --> 00:03:36.770 
there's no air leaks in between the
radiator<00:03:34.200> and<00:03:34.860> the<00:03:35.630> intercooler

00:03:36.770 --> 00:03:36.780 
radiator and the intercooler

00:03:36.780 --> 00:03:40.130 
radiator and the intercooler
so<00:03:37.500> that's<00:03:37.739> a<00:03:38.010> that<00:03:38.880> radiator<00:03:39.300> fan<00:03:39.570> keeps<00:03:39.900> its

00:03:40.130 --> 00:03:40.140 
so that's a that radiator fan keeps its

00:03:40.140 --> 00:03:41.750 
so that's a that radiator fan keeps its
efficiency<00:03:40.890> you<00:03:41.220> can<00:03:41.340> see<00:03:41.519> it<00:03:41.580> right<00:03:41.730> there

00:03:41.750 --> 00:03:41.760 
efficiency you can see it right there

00:03:41.760 --> 00:03:46.310 
efficiency you can see it right there
that<00:03:42.800> weather<00:03:43.800> shirt<00:03:44.130> in<00:03:44.250> there<00:03:44.430> so<00:03:45.080> that's<00:03:46.080> it

00:03:46.310 --> 00:03:46.320 
that weather shirt in there so that's it

00:03:46.320 --> 00:03:48.410 
that weather shirt in there so that's it
that's<00:03:46.470> the<00:03:46.709> whole<00:03:46.800> install<00:03:47.280> should<00:03:48.180> take

00:03:48.410 --> 00:03:48.420 
that's the whole install should take

00:03:48.420 --> 00:03:52.310 
that's the whole install should take
about<00:03:50.120> depending<00:03:51.120> how<00:03:51.180> fast<00:03:51.540> you<00:03:51.840> are<00:03:51.900> should

00:03:52.310 --> 00:03:52.320 
about depending how fast you are should

00:03:52.320 --> 00:03:54.480 
about depending how fast you are should
take<00:03:52.470> about<00:03:52.620> 45<00:03:53.340> minutes<00:03:53.940> to

00:03:54.480 --> 00:03:54.490 
take about 45 minutes to

00:03:54.490 --> 00:04:25.250 
take about 45 minutes to
hour-and-a-half

00:04:25.250 --> 00:04:25.260 

00:04:25.260 --> 00:04:25.410 

you

00:04:25.410 --> 00:04:25.420 
you
