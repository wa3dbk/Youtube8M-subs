00:00:00.390 --> 00:00:05.430
 hello I am change sea or student of the 

00:00:03.179 --> 00:00:07.109
 faculty of law without aspiration of 

00:00:05.430 --> 00:00:09.630
 some candidacy for representation 

00:00:07.109 --> 00:00:11.370
 student simply a student 

00:00:09.630 --> 00:00:12.600
 unhappy about how some are handled 

00:00:11.370 --> 00:00:15.420
 things inside our university 

00:00:12.600 --> 00:00:17.039
 among ourselves as students I know 

00:00:15.420 --> 00:00:18.660
 that many like me will be 

00:00:17.039 --> 00:00:21.150
 unhappy with the government of the country 

00:00:18.660 --> 00:00:23.730
 everyone will have complaints and they will be in 

00:00:21.150 --> 00:00:25.769
 disagreement about how things are handled 

00:00:23.730 --> 00:00:28.409
 however, let's think how different 

00:00:25.769 --> 00:00:31.019
 is in our faculty good for 

00:00:28.409 --> 00:00:33.210
 start first friend from courses 

00:00:31.019 --> 00:00:35.129
 induction even after the 

00:00:33.210 --> 00:00:37.230
 lists of those who entered the 

00:00:35.129 --> 00:00:39.840
 candidates are in search of you are 

00:00:37.230 --> 00:00:41.609
 a vote everyone will be kind everyone 

00:00:39.840 --> 00:00:43.949
 They offer support and all will be 

00:00:41.609 --> 00:00:46.289
 best friends in the world but beware 

00:00:43.949 --> 00:00:48.480
 the same strategy every year and 

00:00:46.289 --> 00:00:50.460
 it's only in campaign time before 

00:00:48.480 --> 00:00:51.989
 of the elections if you ask 

00:00:50.460 --> 00:00:53.699
 any companion of some degree more 

00:00:51.989 --> 00:00:57.149
 advanced will know tell you that this is 

00:00:53.699 --> 00:00:58.920
 It should also be emphasized that all of these 

00:00:57.149 --> 00:00:59.740
 activities may harm our 

00:00:58.920 --> 00:01:02.410
 lifetime 

00:00:59.740 --> 00:01:05.070
 we absorb so much the time it takes us 

00:01:02.410 --> 00:01:07.120
 to fail subjects or even recursar 

00:01:05.070 --> 00:01:10.210
 although at first it seems that it is 

00:01:07.120 --> 00:01:11.860
 fun with a clear and objective purpose not 

00:01:10.210 --> 00:01:14.380
 it's like nothing is worth more than your life 

00:01:11.860 --> 00:01:17.350
 academic but there goes the real point of 

00:01:14.380 --> 00:01:19.600
 this video let us reflect on the people of 

00:01:17.350 --> 00:01:21.520
 scarce resources only have time to 

00:01:19.600 --> 00:01:24.070
 think about working and how they will survive 

00:01:21.520 --> 00:01:25.780
 the next day it is for this reason that 

00:01:24.070 --> 00:01:27.760
 if someone comes and gives them a 

00:01:25.780 --> 00:01:30.520
 pantry or some economic support with 

00:01:27.760 --> 00:01:32.800
 political ends will vote for him because I 

00:01:30.520 --> 00:01:34.030
 Guess give them nothing they never 

00:01:32.800 --> 00:01:36.100
 they have to work in days 

00:01:34.030 --> 00:01:38.800
 extensive labor to have the minimum 

00:01:36.100 --> 00:01:40.630
 quality of life but at least survive 

00:01:38.800 --> 00:01:42.820
 obviously they will not have time to 

00:01:40.630 --> 00:01:44.410
 investigate or read who is and what 

00:01:42.820 --> 00:01:47.350
 proposals have those characters 

00:01:44.410 --> 00:01:50.050
 this is really sad but sadder 

00:01:47.350 --> 00:01:53.110
 is that we capable university students 

00:01:50.050 --> 00:01:54.580
 smart with skill and cunning that 

00:01:53.110 --> 00:01:56.680
 we got here by these same 

00:01:54.580 --> 00:01:59.260
 reasons people that we have the opportunity 

00:01:56.680 --> 00:02:01.660
 to prepare ourselves day by day in this 

00:01:59.260 --> 00:02:03.800
 wonderful institution we follow 

00:02:01.660 --> 00:02:06.380
 choosing our representatives 

00:02:03.800 --> 00:02:08.780
 how many beers invite us to where we 

00:02:06.380 --> 00:02:10.970
 take to eat as many parties do if 

00:02:08.780 --> 00:02:13.280
 they invite us to dinner that so effective in 

00:02:10.970 --> 00:02:15.520
 the beautiful characters or good vibes that 

00:02:13.280 --> 00:02:18.020
 they use to bring students closer 

00:02:15.520 --> 00:02:19.670
 sad is that this whole circus works 

00:02:18.020 --> 00:02:22.130
 sad is that college students do not 

00:02:19.670 --> 00:02:23.680
 we think we do not analyze we do not reflect 

00:02:22.130 --> 00:02:26.540
 where are we going and for what purpose 

00:02:23.680 --> 00:02:28.040
 sad is that those little representatives 

00:02:26.540 --> 00:02:29.780
 interested in improving our 

00:02:28.040 --> 00:02:31.850
 institution or provide better 

00:02:29.780 --> 00:02:33.320
 opportunities for students only 

00:02:31.850 --> 00:02:35.330
 come with the aim of seeing how much 

00:02:33.320 --> 00:02:37.670
 money is left at the end or what position 

00:02:35.330 --> 00:02:39.350
 will have at the end of their management is 

00:02:37.670 --> 00:02:41.720
 important to note that we can not 

00:02:39.350 --> 00:02:44.630
 generalize not everyone has the same 

00:02:41.720 --> 00:02:47.090
 objectives and in life there and have 

00:02:44.630 --> 00:02:48.980
 humans with values â€‹â€‹with attitude of 

00:02:47.090 --> 00:02:50.990
 service and with the firm determination of 

00:02:48.980 --> 00:02:53.530
 improve our faculty is a matter of 

00:02:50.990 --> 00:02:55.820
 analyze awaken university 

00:02:53.530 --> 00:02:57.850
 let's think not always that we stay 

00:02:55.820 --> 00:03:01.750
 the best the fittest let's prepare 

00:02:57.850 --> 00:03:04.760
 let's investigate, let's worry and study 

00:03:01.750 --> 00:03:07.370
 choose the best not the least worst 

00:03:04.760 --> 00:03:09.680
 to the preparation to the insurance that has 

00:03:07.370 --> 00:03:10.440
 determination idealism the one that does not aspire 

00:03:09.680 --> 00:03:12.600
 nothing 

00:03:10.440 --> 00:03:14.580
 he who does not have big goals does not arrive 

00:03:12.600 --> 00:03:16.680
 far we are not indifferent to the 

00:03:14.580 --> 00:03:18.810
 indifference we are running out of people 

00:03:16.680 --> 00:03:20.700
 who complains about what we are used to 

00:03:18.810 --> 00:03:22.170
 put all our complaints on a daily basis 

00:03:20.700 --> 00:03:24.810
 our social networks if we do not achieve 

00:03:22.170 --> 00:03:27.150
 nothing of what use is so much quackery 

00:03:24.810 --> 00:03:29.670
 we do not act on what it is to be young and 

00:03:27.150 --> 00:03:32.070
 no revolutionaries a regulation is not 

00:03:29.670 --> 00:03:34.320
 war is growth if you use the 

00:03:32.070 --> 00:03:35.700
 arguments and the correct way alone 

00:03:34.320 --> 00:03:38.040
 we believe in our minds a 

00:03:35.700 --> 00:03:39.930
 critical thinking we do not sell ourselves with 

00:03:38.040 --> 00:03:42.210
 a beer or because he talks to us more 

00:03:39.930 --> 00:03:43.890
 nice if the rest of the two years that 

00:03:42.210 --> 00:03:45.990
 last, your management will not do anything to 

00:03:43.890 --> 00:03:47.730
 improve the situation if something has 

00:03:45.990 --> 00:03:50.010
 all politicians is an excellent 

00:03:47.730 --> 00:03:52.830
 ability to speak few are those who 

00:03:50.010 --> 00:03:54.720
 act and fulfill that there is the true 

00:03:52.830 --> 00:03:57.390
 importance of knowing how to choose not 

00:03:54.720 --> 00:03:59.550
 let's convince grow let's think 

00:03:57.390 --> 00:04:00.930
 improve and let's be of being those 

00:03:59.550 --> 00:04:03.090
 ignorant that our Mexico is 

00:04:00.930 --> 00:04:05.100
 forming we no longer allow ourselves to be given 

00:04:03.090 --> 00:04:08.040
 bread and circus because unfortunately 

00:04:05.100 --> 00:04:09.650
 among our same colleagues there 

00:04:08.040 --> 00:04:12.430
 who think we are puppets 

00:04:09.650 --> 00:04:14.439
 manipulable with cheap strategies 

00:04:12.430 --> 00:04:17.079
 that are repeated and repeated in one place 

00:04:14.439 --> 00:04:20.169
 without end let's show university students that 

00:04:17.079 --> 00:04:22.210
 it's not like this we are affecting everyone 

00:04:20.169 --> 00:04:25.000
 if we are part of the problem we are part 

00:04:22.210 --> 00:04:26.889
 of the association we created is possible if 

00:04:25.000 --> 00:04:29.110
 we really prepare ourselves and leave a 

00:04:26.889 --> 00:04:31.840
 aside the indifference things will improve 

00:04:29.110 --> 00:04:34.539
 little by little everything evolves from us 

00:04:31.840 --> 00:04:36.430
 it depends if it is to progress or to 

00:04:34.539 --> 00:04:38.800
 stay in the same place all 

00:04:36.430 --> 00:04:41.050
 We have the right to choose the one we 

00:04:38.800 --> 00:04:43.960
 look better and if maybe we all think 

00:04:41.050 --> 00:04:45.610
 different but do not make decisions without 

00:04:43.960 --> 00:04:47.979
 before knowing here we will give you the power 

00:04:45.610 --> 00:04:50.349
 to guide us thanks for taking five 

00:04:47.979 --> 00:04:52.479
 minutes to listen to me I really hope 

00:04:50.349 --> 00:04:54.820
 contribute in some way the progress 

00:04:52.479 --> 00:04:56.139
 of our university maybe there are 

00:04:54.820 --> 00:04:57.820
 people who do not seem like 

00:04:56.139 --> 00:04:59.979
 listen to the truth but honesty 

00:04:57.820 --> 00:05:02.590
 towards others and towards ourselves 

00:04:59.979 --> 00:05:05.110
 is the key to the progress of success and 

00:05:02.590 --> 00:05:07.960
 evolution so for love of our 

00:05:05.110 --> 00:05:09.009
 faculty and our profession let's do what 

00:05:07.960 --> 00:05:13.229
 which is in our hands 

00:05:09.009 --> 00:05:13.229
 for a better country I start today
