00:00:43.370 --> 00:00:43.380 
around and noticed that

00:00:43.380 --> 00:00:44.660 
around and noticed that
the<00:00:43.500> one<00:00:43.740> glitch<00:00:44.010> where<00:00:44.220> you<00:00:44.310> throw<00:00:44.490> your

00:00:44.660 --> 00:00:44.670

the one glitch where you throw your
board<00:00:44.940> and<00:00:45.210> then<00:00:45.650> make<00:00:46.650> it<00:00:46.800> come<00:00:46.950> back<00:00:46.980> and

00:00:47.390 --> 00:00:47.400 
board and then make it come back and

00:00:47.400 --> 00:00:50.500 
board and then make it come back and
stuff<00:00:47.640> and<00:00:48.060> still<00:00:48.330> works<00:00:48.600> a<00:00:48.870> little<00:00:49.020> bit<00:00:49.200> and

00:00:50.500 --> 00:00:50.510 
stuff and still works a little bit and

00:00:50.510 --> 00:00:52.760
