helps the body increase overall
resilience<00:00:19.340> so<00:00:20.340> far<00:00:20.609> we<00:00:20.760> know<00:00:20.970> that<00:00:21.350> it's<00:00:22.350> the

resilience so far we know that it's the

resilience so far we know that it's the

heart brain or spinal cord of a rat is
injured<00:00:26.189> they<00:00:27.029> recover<00:00:27.480> much<00:00:27.840> better<00:00:28.140> if<00:00:28.619> they

00:00:28.849 --> 00:00:28.859

00:00:33.830 --> 00:00:33.840 
have been on ADF but also even if the

recover better for example they tied off

00:00:40.590 --> 00:00:44.600 
recover better for example they tied off
a<00:00:40.890> coronary<00:00:41.460> artery<00:00:41.940> in<00:00:42.390> the<00:00:42.800> rat<00:00:43.800> hearts<00:00:44.430> of

died the hearts of the fasted rats that
survived<00:01:15.590> also<00:01:16.590> functions<00:01:17.159> significantly

00:01:17.810 --> 00:01:17.820 
survived also functions significantly

00:01:17.820 --> 00:01:22.399 
survived also functions significantly
better<00:01:19.100> also<00:01:20.100> you<00:01:20.759> can<00:01:20.939> inject<00:01:21.270> rats<00:01:21.689> that<00:01:22.350> are

00:01:22.399 --> 00:01:22.409 
better also you can inject rats that are

00:01:22.409 --> 00:01:25.670 
better also you can inject rats that are
on<00:01:22.680> ATF<00:01:23.340> with<00:01:23.970> toxic<00:01:24.570> chemicals<00:01:25.110> by

chemotherapy that are designed to kill
cancer<00:01:28.290> and<00:01:28.829> they<00:01:29.400> tolerate<00:01:29.909> it<00:01:30.030> much<00:01:30.329> better

00:01:30.590 --> 00:01:30.600 
cancer and they tolerate it much better

00:01:30.600 --> 00:01:33.950 
cancer and they tolerate it much better
than<00:01:30.780> normal<00:01:31.439> I<00:01:32.270> think<00:01:33.270> that<00:01:33.720> we<00:01:33.840> will

00:01:33.950 --> 00:01:33.960 
than normal I think that we will

00:01:33.960 --> 00:01:35.960 
than normal I think that we will
eventually<00:01:34.259> learn<00:01:34.710> how<00:01:35.009> to<00:01:35.040> put<00:01:35.400> patients

00:01:35.960 --> 00:01:35.970 
eventually learn how to put patients

00:01:35.970 --> 00:01:38.719 
eventually learn how to put patients
with<00:01:36.119> cancer<00:01:36.630> on<00:01:36.810> ATF<00:01:37.320> before<00:01:38.250> they<00:01:38.369> start

00:01:38.719 --> 00:01:38.729 
with cancer on ATF before they start

00:01:38.729 --> 00:01:41.390 
with cancer on ATF before they start
chemotherapy<00:01:39.150> and<00:01:39.869> be<00:01:40.619> able<00:01:40.770> to<00:01:40.950> give<00:01:41.250> them

00:01:41.390 --> 00:01:41.400 
chemotherapy and be able to give them

00:01:41.400 --> 00:01:44.450 
chemotherapy and be able to give them
higher<00:01:41.700> doses<00:01:42.360> of<00:01:42.570> chemotherapy<00:01:43.009> than<00:01:44.009> usual

00:01:44.450 --> 00:01:44.460 
higher doses of chemotherapy than usual

00:01:44.460 --> 00:01:47.149 
higher doses of chemotherapy than usual
and<00:01:44.670> kill<00:01:45.270> more<00:01:45.600> of<00:01:45.630> the<00:01:45.840> cancer<00:01:46.350> with<00:01:46.860> less

00:01:47.149 --> 00:01:47.159 
and kill more of the cancer with less

00:01:47.159 --> 00:01:51.319 
and kill more of the cancer with less
ill<00:01:47.490> effects<00:01:48.030> on<00:01:48.270> the<00:01:48.479> patient<00:01:49.640> rats<00:01:50.640> on<00:01:50.880> ATF

overall resilience ABF also helps
prevent<00:02:20.800> cancer<00:02:20.860> I<00:02:21.750> know<00:02:22.750> of<00:02:23.080> three<00:02:23.320> ways<00:02:23.680> that

00:02:24.600 --> 00:02:24.610 
prevent cancer I know of three ways that

00:02:24.610 --> 00:02:27.350 
prevent cancer I know of three ways that
it<00:02:24.730> does<00:02:24.970> this<00:02:25.180> and<00:02:25.450> there<00:02:25.570> are<00:02:25.690> probably<00:02:25.930> war

00:02:27.350 --> 00:02:27.360 
it does this and there are probably war

00:02:27.360 --> 00:02:31.080 
it does this and there are probably war
first<00:02:28.360> if<00:02:28.690> you<00:02:28.840> inject<00:02:29.230> rats<00:02:29.709> on<00:02:30.069> a<00:02:30.370> VF<00:02:30.730> with

00:02:31.080 --> 00:02:31.090 
first if you inject rats on a VF with

00:02:31.090 --> 00:02:34.170 
first if you inject rats on a VF with
cancer<00:02:31.600> they<00:02:32.410> get<00:02:32.650> cancer<00:02:33.100> much<00:02:33.520> less<00:02:33.850> often

00:02:34.170 --> 00:02:34.180 
cancer they get cancer much less often

00:02:34.180 --> 00:02:37.259 
cancer they get cancer much less often
than<00:02:34.570> rats<00:02:34.840> that<00:02:35.080> are<00:02:35.230> eating<00:02:35.440> normally<00:02:36.269> so

00:02:37.259 --> 00:02:37.269 
than rats that are eating normally so

00:02:37.269 --> 00:02:39.300 
than rats that are eating normally so
this<00:02:37.660> shows<00:02:37.930> that<00:02:37.959> the<00:02:38.320> body's<00:02:38.650> ability<00:02:38.800> to

00:02:39.300 --> 00:02:39.310 
this shows that the body's ability to

00:02:39.310 --> 00:02:42.180 
this shows that the body's ability to
fight<00:02:39.790> cancer<00:02:40.420> once<00:02:41.050> it<00:02:41.230> is<00:02:41.260> formed<00:02:41.680> is

fight cancer once it is formed is

00:02:42.190 --> 00:02:47.280 
fight cancer once it is formed is
