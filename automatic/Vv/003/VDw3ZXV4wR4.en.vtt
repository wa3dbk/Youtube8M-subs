00:00:11.520 --> 00:00:16.269 
when we talk about alignment we're
looking<00:00:12.059> at<00:00:12.270> our<00:00:12.570> knees<00:00:12.900> or<00:00:13.590> feet<00:00:13.910> and<00:00:14.910> hips

00:00:16.269 --> 00:00:16.279 
looking at our knees or feet and hips

00:00:16.279 --> 00:00:20.890 
looking at our knees or feet and hips
maybe<00:00:17.450> but<00:00:18.450> nothing<00:00:18.900> is<00:00:19.110> separate<00:00:19.680> about<00:00:20.490> you

00:00:20.890 --> 00:00:20.900

00:00:24.380 --> 00:00:24.390 
so when we take that awkward step which

00:00:24.390 --> 00:00:28.150 
so when we take that awkward step which
is<00:00:24.419> pivoting<00:00:25.140> on<00:00:25.259> our<00:00:25.590> field<00:00:25.890> to<00:00:26.520> a<00:00:26.550> 45<00:00:27.270> degree
