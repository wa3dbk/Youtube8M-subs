 salad that will be aligned with a 

00:00:29.699 --> 00:00:34.019
 raw agave syrup and then it's not going to 

00:00:32.129 --> 00:00:36.719
 need to throw oil or throw 

00:00:34.019 --> 00:00:39.329
 vinegar or salt then a 

00:00:36.719 --> 00:00:42.600
 very light salad the ingredients that 

00:00:39.329 --> 00:00:45.629
 let's use they 're going to be raw cabbage that 

00:00:42.600 --> 00:00:47.010
 It has been cut very thin in sheets 

00:00:45.629 --> 00:00:50.699
 it's going to be green leaf 

00:00:47.010 --> 00:00:53.159
 here we have canons and arugula cut 

00:00:50.699 --> 00:00:55.850
 not whole but cut very finite with 

00:00:53.159 --> 00:00:58.890

00:00:58.890 --> 00:01:04.320
 taquitos dried tomatoes chopped before 

00:01:01.890 --> 00:01:06.540
 been hydrated so that it is soft on 

00:01:04.320 --> 00:01:08.520
 cucumber here we have an agave syrup 

00:01:06.540 --> 00:01:10.680
 what are you going to see that is a little bit more 

00:01:08.520 --> 00:01:12.930
 dark than normal because it is raw and 

00:01:10.680 --> 00:01:16.650
 then it's darker we're going to have 

00:01:12.930 --> 00:01:19.330
 spicy paprika and for 

00:01:16.650 --> 00:01:22.930
 decorate some dried flowers 

00:01:19.330 --> 00:01:24.730
 then very easy to elaborate very 

00:01:22.930 --> 00:01:27.130
 fast let's take the cabbage first 

00:01:24.730 --> 00:01:29.080
 raw the raw cabbage that keeps all 

00:01:27.130 --> 00:01:31.600
 properties being raw and diaz is very 

00:01:29.080 --> 00:01:32.260
 rich in vitamin c the people who 

00:01:31.600 --> 00:01:34.300
 feel bad 

00:01:32.260 --> 00:01:36.640
 normally do not feel bad about it 

00:01:34.300 --> 00:01:38.260
 raw it is necessary to macerate with salt if 

00:01:36.640 --> 00:01:39.460
 we want a little softer would 

00:01:38.260 --> 00:01:41.650
 have to add a little salt to 

00:01:39.460 --> 00:01:43.000
 close it and with the hand go making it more 

00:01:41.650 --> 00:01:44.890
 long it can be done but it is not 

00:01:43.000 --> 00:01:46.600
 necessary and if part very fine it does not 

00:01:44.890 --> 00:01:48.790
 lack is worth no need to make increases 

00:01:46.600 --> 00:01:49.930
 we are green leaves green leaves 

00:01:48.790 --> 00:01:52.900
 that they can choose what they want 

00:01:49.930 --> 00:01:55.930
 ridiculous canons 

00:01:52.900 --> 00:01:58.570
 let's take a little nuts 

00:01:55.930 --> 00:01:59.890
 has been chopped is also the only 

00:01:58.570 --> 00:02:02.500
 fat that is going to have the salad is the 

00:01:59.890 --> 00:02:04.660
 walnut you can eliminate the businesswoman a 

00:02:02.500 --> 00:02:06.400
 salad without any fat very light 

00:02:04.660 --> 00:02:09.880
 very liberal we started a little bit of 

00:02:06.400 --> 00:02:11.560
 tomato is the fresh we want to remove the 

00:02:09.880 --> 00:02:14.210
 skin to skin in the rows there is no post and 

00:02:11.560 --> 00:02:16.160
 another and we explain how to do it 

00:02:14.210 --> 00:02:17.650
 the dry tomato that has been hydrated 

00:02:16.160 --> 00:02:19.720
 as well 

00:02:17.650 --> 00:02:22.200
 very very very easy very fast super 

00:02:19.720 --> 00:02:22.200
 healthy 

00:02:24.020 --> 00:02:27.400
 the cucumber the cucumber 

00:02:27.480 --> 00:02:30.950
 also cut into taquitos we are going to 

00:02:29.580 --> 00:02:33.569
 throw everything 

00:02:30.950 --> 00:02:35.849
 with joy 

00:02:33.569 --> 00:02:37.709
 and you are told and I am asia would be the base 

00:02:35.849 --> 00:02:39.870
 out of nothing is it worth to us to remove and masters 

00:02:37.709 --> 00:02:42.170
 that this would be already the base salad 

00:02:39.870 --> 00:02:44.510
 we will also add 

00:02:42.170 --> 00:02:46.250
 the dressing that is going to be a room 

00:02:44.510 --> 00:02:50.180
 sweet is going to be we said the syrup of 

00:02:46.250 --> 00:02:51.980
 agave with spicy paprika vera 

00:02:50.180 --> 00:02:53.420
 You can also use other things that 

00:02:51.980 --> 00:02:55.310
 are not we carry the paprika is 

00:02:53.420 --> 00:02:56.930
 Vera salad because it uses a 

00:02:55.310 --> 00:02:59.390
 paprika from the spicy vera but it 

00:02:56.930 --> 00:03:01.640
 could use anything else it 

00:02:59.390 --> 00:03:02.870
 you can throw mustard you can take the 

00:03:01.640 --> 00:03:04.160
 ingredient that you want 

00:03:02.870 --> 00:03:06.400
 we are going to be a little bit of 

00:03:04.160 --> 00:03:08.379
 paprika 

00:03:06.400 --> 00:03:10.810
 what is a treasure and the syrup you said 

00:03:08.379 --> 00:03:12.640
 which is raw and the syrup is raw if the 

00:03:10.810 --> 00:03:15.629
 Syrup is raw then once here 

00:03:12.640 --> 00:03:15.629
 we will remove 

00:03:19.220 --> 00:03:23.599
 and we launch salty 

00:03:24.870 --> 00:03:30.090
 it is very very very very easy 

00:03:27.930 --> 00:03:32.819
 the super good result because it has a 

00:03:30.090 --> 00:03:35.970
 very sweet and likes all 

00:03:32.819 --> 00:03:38.240
 world once it's here we start to 

00:03:35.970 --> 00:03:39.860
 stir 

00:03:38.240 --> 00:03:41.240
 well until the psir is integrated the 

00:03:39.860 --> 00:03:42.560
 scales the dressing 

00:03:41.240 --> 00:03:44.450
 and in fact we only let a 

00:03:42.560 --> 00:03:46.280
 little bit with the syrup you are not salt and 

00:03:44.450 --> 00:03:47.750
 nothing did not put salt or anything could be 

00:03:46.280 --> 00:03:49.970
 think if we wanted to go but 

00:03:47.750 --> 00:03:51.710
 simply with the sweetness of syrup and 

00:03:49.970 --> 00:03:53.090
 alone and it also has a lot of flavor because 

00:03:51.710 --> 00:03:55.460
 the paprika of the vera has a flavor 

00:03:53.090 --> 00:03:57.230
 Very powerful 

00:03:55.460 --> 00:04:00.020
 and will impregnate all things not 

00:03:57.230 --> 00:04:02.360
 you need more flavors here because the 

00:04:00.020 --> 00:04:05.290
 Paprika de la Vera comes as a book 

00:04:02.360 --> 00:04:08.409
 of spicy is my septic field a little 

00:04:05.290 --> 00:04:09.969
 for lovers great bright 

00:04:08.409 --> 00:04:11.349
 if you do not like the spicy you could 

00:04:09.969 --> 00:04:14.409
 have with sweet paprika for example 

00:04:11.349 --> 00:04:17.079
 ok then we will remove and this already 

00:04:14.409 --> 00:04:18.699
 I would be ready to place 

00:04:17.079 --> 00:04:20.109
 It would be very good to leave it to the best as 

00:04:18.699 --> 00:04:22.000
 five minutes so that it impregnates more and 

00:04:20.109 --> 00:04:23.800
 the green leaves soften a bit 

00:04:22.000 --> 00:04:26.600
 but if not, it would not take no 

00:04:23.800 --> 00:04:29.120
 pick up our plate 

00:04:26.600 --> 00:04:32.380
 and we're going to plant from here then 

00:04:29.120 --> 00:04:32.380
 we would do a little 

00:04:32.560 --> 00:04:37.860
 what color does he have 

00:04:35.490 --> 00:04:39.330
 also the cabbage is super powerful is very 

00:04:37.860 --> 00:04:41.430
 very good and there are people that if you are wrong 

00:04:39.330 --> 00:04:43.860
 but it's when you cook when it's so 

00:04:41.430 --> 00:04:45.720
 raw normally the symptoms the a 

00:04:43.860 --> 00:04:47.400
 to all those who are afraid that 

00:04:45.720 --> 00:04:49.199
 I can sit down to try it on 

00:04:47.400 --> 00:04:51.090
 run they throw you raw better provide it 

00:04:49.199 --> 00:04:53.280
 raw because normally it's always going to 

00:04:51.090 --> 00:04:55.310
 sit well but you think it would have 

00:04:53.280 --> 00:04:58.440
 that to be the opposite truth that then not 

00:04:55.310 --> 00:05:00.590
 so for example we have there already 

00:04:58.440 --> 00:05:04.009
 we would go to the plated one we are going to use 

00:05:00.590 --> 00:05:04.009
 the dried flowers 

00:05:06.100 --> 00:05:10.400
 how about 

00:05:08.210 --> 00:05:11.690
 eager to eat more problems of 

00:05:10.400 --> 00:05:13.580
 salty but next are the 

00:05:11.690 --> 00:05:17.129
 battered is salty impressions 36 

00:05:13.580 --> 00:05:19.469
 but we do not want cheerful salads 

00:05:17.129 --> 00:05:20.470
 and wants to lay a little bit of element 

00:05:19.469 --> 00:05:24.480
 over 

00:05:20.470 --> 00:05:24.480
 to see what the base element is 

00:05:29.529 --> 00:05:34.449
 and this is our raw vegan salad 

00:05:32.229 --> 00:05:36.699
 of cabbage that we have called salad 

00:05:34.449 --> 00:05:39.419
 we will hope you like it and that you 

00:05:36.699 --> 00:05:39.419
 encourage to do it
