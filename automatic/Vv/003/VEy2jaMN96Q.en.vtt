incentives<00:03:39.730> are<00:03:39.910> helpful<00:03:40.270> but<00:03:41.110> if<00:03:41.140> that's<00:03:41.440> the

00:03:41.520 --> 00:03:41.530 
incentives are helpful but if that's the

00:03:41.530 --> 00:03:43.230

00:03:45.420 --> 00:03:45.430 
programs I say forget it because just

00:03:45.430 --> 00:03:47.250 
programs I say forget it because just
having<00:03:45.760> more<00:03:45.940> education<00:03:46.570> available<00:03:46.810> is
