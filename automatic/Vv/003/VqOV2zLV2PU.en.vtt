00:00:04.130 --> 00:00:09.150
 the day I received questions 

00:00:06.629 --> 00:00:11.400
 concerning knitting in the continental and 

00:00:09.150 --> 00:00:14.519
 especially how I advance the enamel without 

00:00:11.400 --> 00:00:16.039
 have to let go of the wire and so theirs is 

00:00:14.519 --> 00:00:18.720
 wrapped around my fingers 

00:00:16.039 --> 00:00:20.400
 one of you was telling me that she was winning 

00:00:18.720 --> 00:00:22.470
 of time with this knitting method 

00:00:20.400 --> 00:00:24.060
 but suddenly having to do everything 

00:00:22.470 --> 00:00:26.400
 let go to advance her stitches she 

00:00:24.060 --> 00:00:28.349
 was wasting time again I think 

00:00:26.400 --> 00:00:30.150
 the best way for you 

00:00:28.349 --> 00:00:32.390
 show how I do it's from 

00:00:30.150 --> 00:00:34.620
 do a great full of my many 

00:00:32.390 --> 00:00:35.820
 without comment I just wanted 

00:00:34.620 --> 00:00:38.460
 watched my movement 

00:00:35.820 --> 00:00:39.570
 it's my own method maybe 

00:00:38.460 --> 00:00:40.920
 that she as you will not agree 

00:00:39.570 --> 00:00:44.610
 maybe she'll give you ideas 

00:00:40.920 --> 00:00:47.940
 so here I have a rank that has to make 150 

00:00:44.610 --> 00:00:50.309
 170 miles so the video is going to be a bit 

00:00:47.940 --> 00:00:52.289
 longuette I do the big full like 

00:00:50.309 --> 00:00:54.420
 I would do it if you were not there and 

00:00:52.289 --> 00:00:59.579
 and I hope it can help you 

00:00:54.420 --> 00:01:03.120
 so I start first I 

00:00:59.579 --> 00:01:04.439
 tendency to well loaded my needle in 

00:01:03.120 --> 00:01:07.020
 plus this is a circular needle 

00:01:04.439 --> 00:01:10.130
 so she's short enough for not 

00:01:07.020 --> 00:01:15.260
 have to interrupt too quickly 

00:01:10.130 --> 00:01:15.260
 then I get ready and I start 

00:01:52.100 --> 00:01:58.729
 in fact I'm pushing with my right index finger 

00:01:55.030 --> 00:02:01.220
 the tip of the left needle like that 

00:01:58.729 --> 00:02:03.820
 that advance enamel that are in reserve at 

00:02:01.220 --> 00:02:03.820
 end of the eel 

00:02:22.250 --> 00:02:26.110
 so I hope you see well 

00:02:23.480 --> 00:02:26.110
 movement 

00:02:35.270 --> 00:02:39.710
 So here this time I loose 

00:02:37.450 --> 00:02:44.450
 to charge my needle again 

00:02:39.710 --> 00:02:46.100
 circular so for now I have 

00:02:44.450 --> 00:02:48.670
 dropped after 50 or so 

00:02:46.100 --> 00:02:48.670
 hand and I think 

00:03:04.380 --> 00:03:08.610
 good I must admit that it is also 

00:03:06.240 --> 00:03:11.540
 two metal needles so she 

00:03:08.610 --> 00:03:13.770
 glide easily 

00:03:11.540 --> 00:03:18.380
 I particularly like the needles 

00:03:13.770 --> 00:03:18.380
 well pointed and that slips a lot 

00:03:23.780 --> 00:03:28.870
 so here is the object to charge yet 

00:03:26.180 --> 00:03:28.870
 so I dropped everything 

00:03:57.390 --> 00:04:01.510
 so here I think I'm not going 

00:03:59.830 --> 00:04:03.129
 to go to the end of the rank is not the 

00:04:01.510 --> 00:04:05.580
 hardly I think you saw the 

00:04:03.129 --> 00:04:05.580
 principle 

00:04:06.360 --> 00:04:11.590
 in fact it's mainly my index 

00:04:09.190 --> 00:04:15.230
 right that moves the eil and I do 

00:04:11.590 --> 00:04:18.180
 some interruptions for good 

00:04:15.230 --> 00:04:19.950
 well well loaded my left needle at 

00:04:18.180 --> 00:04:22.050
 maximum by putting a maximum of mesh 

00:04:19.950 --> 00:04:24.780
 on it you see here the 

00:04:22.050 --> 00:04:26.790
 charges and so actually on a rank of 

00:04:24.780 --> 00:04:32.850
 170 matches I would have interrupted 

00:04:26.790 --> 00:04:36.030
 three or four times so here to 

00:04:32.850 --> 00:04:42.050
 the little anecdote is a book 

00:04:36.030 --> 00:04:45.180
 test and I thought myself enough 

00:04:42.050 --> 00:04:46.830
 steady is in the middle of tension 

00:04:45.180 --> 00:04:48.810
 for not making samples being 

00:04:46.830 --> 00:04:50.760
 given that I was taking the same wool and 

00:04:48.810 --> 00:04:53.640
 the same needles as the model of 

00:04:50.760 --> 00:04:55.890
 base and I just realized that my 

00:04:53.640 --> 00:04:58.170
 work is going to be way too big I have 

00:04:55.890 --> 00:05:00.140
 at least 3 4 centimeters too much I'm going 

00:04:58.170 --> 00:05:03.090
 so all must have irons to redo 

00:05:00.140 --> 00:05:06.360
 going down in size and size 

00:05:03.090 --> 00:05:07.890
 of aiguilhe one size of douvres age I 

00:05:06.360 --> 00:05:10.800
 mean and in needle size so 

00:05:07.890 --> 00:05:14.460
 here I went we'll say a week 

00:05:10.800 --> 00:05:15.560
 and half on about this work and I'm going 

00:05:14.460 --> 00:05:19.490
 have to start all over again 

00:05:15.560 --> 00:05:23.520
 I hope this video will have you 

00:05:19.490 --> 00:05:26.880
 well completed the first is allowed to 

00:05:23.520 --> 00:05:29.430
 may have found yours too 

00:05:26.880 --> 00:05:30.690
 way to do if you have any 

00:05:29.430 --> 00:05:32.700
 questions as usual you 

00:05:30.690 --> 00:05:34.470
 do not hesitate to contact you on my 

00:05:32.700 --> 00:05:37.220
 spiro blog reels points like a 

00:05:34.470 --> 00:05:37.220
 have a good day
