00:01:54.440 --> 00:01:54.450 
color but if you have to be very careful

00:01:54.450 --> 00:01:56.690 
color but if you have to be very careful
so<00:01:54.479> it<00:01:54.720> doesn't<00:01:54.990> look<00:01:55.140> you<00:01:55.920> know<00:01:56.040> garish<00:01:56.460> or

a toy that just recently came out with

00:03:21.560 --> 00:03:23.979 
a toy that just recently came out with
kid<00:03:21.919> robot<00:03:22.250> what<00:03:22.790> was<00:03:23.000> that<00:03:23.120> about<00:03:23.329> the<00:03:23.780> mini

00:03:23.979 --> 00:03:23.989 
kid robot what was that about the mini

00:03:23.989 --> 00:03:25.839

Donny<00:03:24.260> well<00:03:24.949> yeah<00:03:25.040> that<00:03:25.160> was<00:03:25.280> like<00:03:25.370> a<00:03:25.459> platform

00:03:25.839 --> 00:03:25.849 
Donny well yeah that was like a platform

00:03:25.849 --> 00:03:27.460 
Donny well yeah that was like a platform
toy<00:03:26.060> Donny<00:03:26.329> and<00:03:26.510> everybody<00:03:26.780> does<00:03:26.959> the<00:03:27.260> Donny

00:03:27.460 --> 00:03:27.470 
toy Donny and everybody does the Donny

00:03:27.470 --> 00:03:29.379 
toy Donny and everybody does the Donny
so<00:03:27.769> I<00:03:27.889> think<00:03:28.280> they<00:03:28.340> only<00:03:28.370> made<00:03:28.609> 400<00:03:29.090> and<00:03:29.299> it

00:03:29.379 --> 00:03:29.389 
so I think they only made 400 and it

00:03:29.389 --> 00:03:30.970 
so I think they only made 400 and it
would<00:03:29.480> just<00:03:29.629> kind<00:03:29.720> of<00:03:29.810> like<00:03:29.930> an<00:03:30.049> x-ray<00:03:30.379> you
