00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.080
 everything costs german then today 

00:00:01.979 --> 00:00:06.240
 we're going to do a little inspired manicure 

00:00:04.080 --> 00:00:09.030
 by the art deco movement that marks you 

00:00:06.240 --> 00:00:10.830
 this site I've always loved adored and 

00:00:09.030 --> 00:00:13.469
 then as I had a little desire to 

00:00:10.830 --> 00:00:15.210
 decorate my nails for work the 

00:00:13.469 --> 00:00:18.049
 colors and shapes were perfect 

00:00:15.210 --> 00:00:18.049
 Let's go 

00:00:48.380 --> 00:00:52.410
 so for this manicure you will have 

00:00:50.700 --> 00:00:53.820
 need a base me it's a base 

00:00:52.410 --> 00:00:56.280
 hardening me scop 

00:00:53.820 --> 00:00:59.100
 then you will need a walleye so me 

00:00:56.280 --> 00:01:00.720
 it's a long dream khroma chameleon and 

00:00:59.100 --> 00:01:03.510
 then you will need a black so 

00:01:00.720 --> 00:01:05.309
 me it's a black glitter brand 

00:01:03.510 --> 00:01:06.060
 Chanel is comfortable and it's from the collection 

00:01:05.309 --> 00:01:08.370
 hanger game 

00:01:06.060 --> 00:01:10.770
 then you will need a top coat for 

00:01:08.370 --> 00:01:12.780
 shine everything and if you want 

00:01:10.770 --> 00:01:14.840
 I tried it really nice 

00:01:12.780 --> 00:01:17.640
 a matte effect top coat 

00:01:14.840 --> 00:01:20.009
 then you will need little strip 

00:01:17.640 --> 00:01:21.240
 or two pieces of tape for those who 

00:01:20.009 --> 00:01:22.619
 have streaks to store them I have a 

00:01:21.240 --> 00:01:24.960
 little technique I put them in a 

00:01:22.619 --> 00:01:26.970
 old display at this coach is 

00:01:24.960 --> 00:01:30.360
 a lot much easier especially if 

00:01:26.970 --> 00:01:33.290
 you want to transport so we start 

00:01:30.360 --> 00:01:33.290
 by but our base 

00:01:33.980 --> 00:01:38.990
 and then we will put our color 

00:01:36.260 --> 00:01:41.780
 golden so the important thing is good 

00:01:38.990 --> 00:01:44.720
 Spread it well wait until it dries 

00:01:41.780 --> 00:01:46.040
 without making bubbles because for 

00:01:44.720 --> 00:01:47.390
 put the little strips over it 

00:01:46.040 --> 00:01:51.080
 will have to have this race 

00:01:47.390 --> 00:01:53.510
 extremely dry because if not so 

00:01:51.080 --> 00:01:55.490
 you remove the strips the varnish goes 

00:01:53.510 --> 00:01:57.290
 come with so that's the time for you 

00:01:55.490 --> 00:01:58.820
 to make a small and quiet or 

00:01:57.290 --> 00:01:59.540
 watch an episode of a series or of 

00:01:58.820 --> 00:02:03.380
 read a book 

00:01:59.540 --> 00:02:04.640
 and then we'll come back in his minute so 

00:02:03.380 --> 00:02:05.720
 now that it is well it is 

00:02:04.640 --> 00:02:07.280
 we will be able to pass to the small 

00:02:05.720 --> 00:02:09.350
 strips so you can help yourself from a 

00:02:07.280 --> 00:02:11.510
 chisel and tweezers this will 

00:02:09.350 --> 00:02:14.420
 easier so what are you going to do 

00:02:11.510 --> 00:02:17.030
 positioned myself as I make you 

00:02:14.420 --> 00:02:19.130
 just there it will be too hard explained from 

00:02:17.030 --> 00:02:21.340
 I'm silent and I leave you 

00:02:19.130 --> 00:02:21.340
 watch 

00:03:04.730 --> 00:03:08.959
 so that's the end result is 

00:03:06.860 --> 00:03:11.989
 now we are in a hurry to make it 

00:03:08.959 --> 00:03:15.260
 glue and we'll put the layer of 

00:03:11.989 --> 00:03:16.790
 black polish so go easy for 

00:03:15.260 --> 00:03:19.519
 not that it goes under the strips we know 

00:03:16.790 --> 00:03:21.080
 so of course I never used 

00:03:19.519 --> 00:03:24.110
 black and gold but you can study 

00:03:21.080 --> 00:03:25.459
 the color that you prefer then 

00:03:24.110 --> 00:03:27.230
 do not wait for it to dry especially it's 

00:03:25.459 --> 00:03:30.640
 very important is that we have finished 

00:03:27.230 --> 00:03:30.640
 pause we remove the strips 

00:03:32.780 --> 00:03:35.930
 so there may be small 

00:03:34.010 --> 00:03:37.790
 dripping me I see them a little 

00:03:35.930 --> 00:03:39.860
 little there but you can still 

00:03:37.790 --> 00:03:42.370
 scrub it clean after that there is 

00:03:39.860 --> 00:03:42.370
 no problem 

00:03:46.890 --> 00:03:51.150
 so that's what it gives once 

00:03:49.000 --> 00:03:53.050
 cleaned and dry 

00:03:51.150 --> 00:03:54.790
 to give you a little more 

00:03:53.050 --> 00:03:57.480
 of examples that's what I did on 

00:03:54.790 --> 00:03:57.480
 the other fingers 

00:04:27.840 --> 00:04:33.320
 and here is a little bit of a top 

00:04:29.850 --> 00:04:33.320
 coat and that's what it gives 

00:04:48.840 --> 00:04:53.100
 and so as I told you you can 

00:04:50.550 --> 00:04:55.650
 do with other colors it's also 

00:04:53.100 --> 00:04:59.090
 super pretty super stylish and it can 

00:04:55.650 --> 00:04:59.090
 make really very very well 

00:05:10.630 --> 00:05:14.200
 I hope you enjoyed yourself 

00:05:12.970 --> 00:05:15.490
 will find himself next Saturday for a 

00:05:14.200 --> 00:05:18.690
 new video I make you big 

00:05:15.490 --> 00:05:18.690
 kisses and the ticket Saturday
