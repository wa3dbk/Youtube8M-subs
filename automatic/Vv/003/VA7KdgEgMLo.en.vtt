00:00:14.660 --> 00:00:17.610
 Again, my second day is here 

00:00:16.890 --> 00:00:19.860
 in Austria 

00:00:17.610 --> 00:00:21.690
 yesterday I'm already at six o'clock 

00:00:19.860 --> 00:00:23.700
 in the morning at home until eight hours 

00:00:21.690 --> 00:00:24.960
 or almost nine hours by train 

00:00:23.700 --> 00:00:26.939
 been traveling 

00:00:24.960 --> 00:00:29.070
 if then in the afternoon only here 

00:00:26.939 --> 00:00:31.890
 arrived there I was still out in 

00:00:29.070 --> 00:00:33.900
 a spot in innsbruck a bit too 

00:00:31.890 --> 00:00:35.730
 train in the evening and then in the 

00:00:33.900 --> 00:00:39.120
 hall run when I no longer 

00:00:35.730 --> 00:00:40.170
 Today I was already in the garden 

00:00:39.120 --> 00:00:42.809
 someone here is fighting under one 

00:00:40.170 --> 00:00:44.489
 parcours built up to train and 

00:00:42.809 --> 00:00:47.700
 I arrived here in the hall now 

00:00:44.489 --> 00:00:51.030
 also smaller out here again 

00:00:47.700 --> 00:00:52.920
 Courses were on the running track 

00:00:51.030 --> 00:00:54.840
 Dive containers give where to over 

00:00:52.920 --> 00:00:57.390
 Anyway, climbing has to be on the 

00:00:54.840 --> 00:00:59.430
 photos that's why I'm going now 

00:00:57.390 --> 00:01:01.230
 Here's a bit of it again 

00:00:59.430 --> 00:01:03.059
 train technology how to get up 

00:01:01.230 --> 00:01:04.739
 So more comes up so fast and also 

00:01:03.059 --> 00:01:06.060
 jump down again and pick up and 

00:01:04.739 --> 00:01:08.910
 practice a little bit the other day 

00:01:06.060 --> 00:01:11.160
 you can also do it here again 

00:01:08.910 --> 00:01:12.869
 my tutorial on dolls we about 

00:01:11.160 --> 00:01:14.130
 walls go up when he first the 

00:01:12.869 --> 00:01:15.000
 obstacles have come up then 

00:01:14.130 --> 00:01:16.380
 Do you want to go back as soon as possible? 

00:01:15.000 --> 00:01:17.729
 come down on the other side though 

00:01:16.380 --> 00:01:19.080
 he just just jumps down and 

00:01:17.729 --> 00:01:20.689
 then you have to catch everything with your legs 

00:01:19.080 --> 00:01:23.729
 will give a lot to the thighs 

00:01:20.689 --> 00:01:25.350
 robs a lot of energy and yes that 

00:01:23.729 --> 00:01:27.420
 will you then notice after that 

00:01:25.350 --> 00:01:28.979
 that's why you have to race a few kilometers 

00:01:27.420 --> 00:01:29.850
 I would definitely advise you to 

00:01:28.979 --> 00:01:31.650
 picked up by da 

00:01:29.850 --> 00:01:32.850
 if it can not yet you can 

00:01:31.650 --> 00:01:33.869
 here again my tutorial 

00:01:32.850 --> 00:01:36.150
 I've seen that before 

00:01:33.869 --> 00:01:38.729
 I show you how it possible 

00:01:36.150 --> 00:01:40.470
 energy saving you off today so that you 

00:01:38.729 --> 00:01:43.350
 not so much power loses it and 

00:01:40.470 --> 00:01:45.420
 can continue to run smoothly 

00:01:43.350 --> 00:01:47.790
 for the endurance I will now easy 

00:01:45.420 --> 00:01:49.560
 Ten times those are all going down 

00:01:47.790 --> 00:01:51.080
 jump clear again and the same 

00:01:49.560 --> 00:01:53.159
 do again 

00:01:51.080 --> 00:01:54.270
 I find that very cool in any case 

00:01:53.159 --> 00:01:56.220
 a bit to train the stamina 

00:01:54.270 --> 00:02:01.979
 you will notice something completely different than 

00:01:56.220 --> 00:02:03.659
 if you just walk straight when you are 

00:02:01.979 --> 00:02:06.180
 an inclined wall high follows, and in 

00:02:03.659 --> 00:02:07.860
 Few countries even at the end of the 

00:02:06.180 --> 00:02:09.899
 quarter pipe is when you're up there 

00:02:07.860 --> 00:02:12.030
 then it is important that we take care of it 

00:02:09.899 --> 00:02:12.989
 Be sure to keep it upright 

00:02:12.030 --> 00:02:14.850
 stays with the upper body 

00:02:12.989 --> 00:02:16.110
 who a little bit with his chest to the wall 

00:02:14.850 --> 00:02:18.120
 otherwise you can not go up 

00:02:16.110 --> 00:02:20.519
 with your arms to the edge of the wall 

00:02:18.120 --> 00:02:21.900
 grab but raises forward 

00:02:20.519 --> 00:02:23.100
 otherwise we 'll go too far for the balls 

00:02:21.900 --> 00:02:25.769
 changes with the upper body 

00:02:23.100 --> 00:02:27.120
 if you're leaning back since that 

00:02:25.769 --> 00:02:29.610
 robs you of some height 

00:02:27.120 --> 00:02:31.010
 So always pay attention to it 

00:02:29.610 --> 00:02:33.180
 chest to be wall 

00:02:31.010 --> 00:02:34.980
 Of course, a little bit of distance still has to be done 

00:02:33.180 --> 00:02:36.989
 I'll stick to it with my knees 

00:02:34.980 --> 00:02:39.000
 the wall comes when you go upstairs 

00:02:36.989 --> 00:02:42.709
 but really try the step like that 

00:02:39.000 --> 00:02:42.709
 stay close to the wall as close as possible 

00:02:43.220 --> 00:02:47.190
 if your team is running and one of you 

00:02:45.630 --> 00:02:49.200
 but the walls are better 

00:02:47.190 --> 00:02:50.940
 then you can also get one 

00:02:49.200 --> 00:02:53.370
 make a little trick that one up 

00:02:50.940 --> 00:02:54.720
 wait for the other and then up 

00:02:53.370 --> 00:02:58.070
 hangs on the wall structure here that 

00:02:54.720 --> 00:03:00.359
 the two of them show the video quite cool 

00:02:58.070 --> 00:03:01.950
 It is important that it is up there 

00:03:00.359 --> 00:03:04.560
 Holds well and best too 

00:03:01.950 --> 00:03:05.670
 heavier even the other so that of 

00:03:04.560 --> 00:03:06.660
 below does not come up the other 

00:03:05.670 --> 00:03:08.489
 just pull back down 

00:03:06.660 --> 00:03:10.709
 You also have to be careful that 

00:03:08.489 --> 00:03:11.880
 the arm is not too sweaty and that 

00:03:10.709 --> 00:03:13.440
 they him at least before another message 

00:03:11.880 --> 00:03:14.130
 from wipes with you not a few 

00:03:13.440 --> 00:03:15.720
 slipping away 

00:03:14.130 --> 00:03:17.730
 I 'm done outside now I'll 

00:03:15.720 --> 00:03:18.750
 you always train dogs in afterwards 

00:03:17.730 --> 00:03:20.310
 maybe I'm going a bit too 

00:03:18.750 --> 00:03:21.959
 I'm not sure yet about John 

00:03:20.310 --> 00:03:24.360
 I'm pretty broke that was 

00:03:21.959 --> 00:03:27.040
 daylong train everywhere 

00:03:24.360 --> 00:03:28.740
 yes if you liked it if mine 

00:03:27.040 --> 00:03:31.360
 tips for you were for november 

00:03:28.740 --> 00:03:33.760
 Generally the thumb goes up 

00:03:31.360 --> 00:03:35.620
