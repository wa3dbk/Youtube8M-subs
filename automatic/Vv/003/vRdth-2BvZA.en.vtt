through this frame of mind
you<00:00:33.380> cannot<00:00:33.650> stop<00:00:33.950> your<00:00:34.130> mind<00:00:34.520> from<00:00:34.940> being

00:00:39.760 --> 00:00:39.770 
things that it does and of course what

00:00:39.770 --> 00:00:41.639 
things that it does and of course what
mine<00:00:39.980> does<00:00:40.340> is<00:00:40.670> that<00:00:40.789> it<00:00:40.940> measures<00:00:41.180> it

00:00:41.639 --> 00:00:41.649 
mine does is that it measures it

00:00:41.649 --> 00:00:45.189 
mine does is that it measures it
measures<00:00:42.649> this<00:00:42.860> and<00:00:43.190> that<00:00:43.399> this<00:00:43.789> and<00:00:43.850> that<00:00:44.199> you

00:00:45.189 --> 00:00:45.199 
measures this and that this and that you

00:00:45.199 --> 00:00:47.410 
measures this and that this and that you
get<00:00:45.410> caught<00:00:45.559> in<00:00:45.680> the<00:00:45.770> trap<00:00:45.969> you<00:00:46.969> get<00:00:47.120> caught<00:00:47.300> in

00:00:47.410 --> 00:00:47.420 
get caught in the trap you get caught in

00:00:47.420 --> 00:00:48.610 
get caught in the trap you get caught in
the<00:00:47.480> trap<00:00:47.510> of<00:00:47.960> thinking<00:00:48.020> that<00:00:48.469> the

00:00:48.610 --> 00:00:48.620 
the trap of thinking that the

00:00:48.620 --> 00:00:50.849 
the trap of thinking that the
measurement<00:00:49.190> itself<00:00:49.670> is<00:00:49.850> a<00:00:49.879> way<00:00:50.149> of<00:00:50.390> actually

00:00:50.849 --> 00:00:50.859 
measurement itself is a way of actually

00:00:50.859 --> 00:00:53.709 
measurement itself is a way of actually
coming<00:00:51.859> to<00:00:52.010> a<00:00:52.039> point<00:00:52.430> of<00:00:52.670> recognition<00:00:53.239> of<00:00:53.510> what

00:00:53.709 --> 00:00:53.719 
coming to a point of recognition of what

00:00:53.719 --> 00:00:57.069 
coming to a point of recognition of what
is<00:00:53.840> correct<00:00:54.260> for<00:00:54.469> oneself<00:00:54.920> asan<00:00:55.250> so<00:00:55.899> it's<00:00:56.899> in

00:00:57.069 --> 00:00:57.079 
is correct for oneself asan so it's in

00:00:57.079 --> 00:00:58.540 
is correct for oneself asan so it's in
those<00:00:57.199> moments<00:00:57.500> where<00:00:57.769> you<00:00:57.859> need<00:00:58.129> to<00:00:58.309> make<00:00:58.340> a

00:00:58.540 --> 00:00:58.550 
those moments where you need to make a

00:00:58.550 --> 00:01:01.540 
those moments where you need to make a
decision<00:00:59.120> that<00:00:59.600> that<00:01:00.289> decision<00:01:01.010> has<00:01:01.190> to<00:01:01.340> come

00:01:01.540 --> 00:01:01.550 
decision that that decision has to come

00:01:01.550 --> 00:01:04.240 
decision that that decision has to come
out<00:01:01.730> of<00:01:01.760> your<00:01:01.969> strategy<00:01:02.629> and<00:01:02.780> authority<00:01:03.440> it's

00:01:04.240 --> 00:01:04.250 
out of your strategy and authority it's

00:01:04.250 --> 00:01:07.660 
out of your strategy and authority it's
then<00:01:04.730> that<00:01:05.120> you<00:01:05.510> require<00:01:06.050> that<00:01:06.410> it's<00:01:07.340> only

00:01:07.660 --> 00:01:07.670 
then that you require that it's only

00:01:07.670 --> 00:01:10.539 
then that you require that it's only
then<00:01:08.320> there<00:01:09.320> is<00:01:09.439> something<00:01:09.770> to<00:01:09.890> grasp<00:01:10.189> about

00:01:10.539 --> 00:01:10.549 
then there is something to grasp about

00:01:10.549 --> 00:01:14.140 
then there is something to grasp about
this<00:01:11.060> mechanic<00:01:11.750> it's<00:01:12.409> very<00:01:12.710> simple<00:01:13.250> it<00:01:13.490> is

00:01:14.140 --> 00:01:14.150 
this mechanic it's very simple it is

00:01:14.150 --> 00:01:18.460 
this mechanic it's very simple it is
about<00:01:14.900> making<00:01:15.909> decisions<00:01:17.020> nothing<00:01:18.020> else

00:01:18.460 --> 00:01:18.470 
about making decisions nothing else

00:01:18.470 --> 00:01:22.140 
about making decisions nothing else
see<00:01:19.369> we're<00:01:19.939> objects<00:01:20.360> moving<00:01:20.600> in<00:01:20.840> space

00:01:22.140 --> 00:01:22.150 
see we're objects moving in space

00:01:27.730 --> 00:01:27.740 
navigation it's the way in which you

00:01:27.740 --> 00:01:31.480 
navigation it's the way in which you
move<00:01:28.270> through<00:01:29.270> this<00:01:29.479> Maya<00:01:29.950> and<00:01:30.950> to<00:01:31.159> do<00:01:31.310> so

00:01:31.480 --> 00:01:31.490 
move through this Maya and to do so

00:01:31.490 --> 00:01:34.359 
move through this Maya and to do so
correctly<00:01:31.640> to<00:01:32.090> do<00:01:32.240> so<00:01:32.450> as<00:01:32.630> yourself<00:01:33.170> is<00:01:34.040> to<00:01:34.220> get

00:01:45.130 --> 00:01:48.490 
mind do all the measuring it wants to do
but<00:01:46.130> save<00:01:46.430> the<00:01:46.670> decision-making<00:01:47.540> for
