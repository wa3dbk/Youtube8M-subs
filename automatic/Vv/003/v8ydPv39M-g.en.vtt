that this is beta of the game so a lot

00:00:09.240 --> 00:00:10.250 
that this is beta of the game so a lot
of<00:00:09.269> things<00:00:09.480> are<00:00:09.599> probably<00:00:09.719> going<00:00:09.929> to<00:00:10.019> change

00:00:15.470 --> 00:00:15.480 
is that her buttons are a little

00:00:15.480 --> 00:00:17.150 
is that her buttons are a little
different<00:00:15.690> right<00:00:16.020> so<00:00:16.289> normally<00:00:16.440> chun<00:00:16.859> latest

00:00:17.150 --> 00:00:17.160 
different right so normally chun latest

different right so normally chun latest
a<00:00:17.279> medium<00:00:17.580> punch<00:00:17.760> is<00:00:17.880> a<00:00:17.910> really<00:00:18.150> important

00:00:18.529 --> 00:00:18.539 
a medium punch is a really important

00:00:18.539 --> 00:00:20.450 
a medium punch is a really important
button<00:00:18.779> but<00:00:19.650> it's<00:00:19.740> a<00:00:19.800> lot<00:00:19.949> different<00:00:20.100> in<00:00:20.400> this

00:00:20.450 --> 00:00:20.460 
button but it's a lot different in this

closer<00:00:23.130> to<00:00:23.220> what<00:00:23.369> you<00:00:23.490> would<00:00:23.550> think<00:00:23.730> of<00:00:23.939> for

00:00:24.529 --> 00:00:24.539 
closer to what you would think of for

00:00:24.539 --> 00:00:26.120 
closer to what you would think of for
normal<00:00:24.840> chun-li<00:00:25.019> also<00:00:25.410> she<00:00:25.470> has<00:00:25.590> dan<00:00:25.830> medium

for<00:01:18.000> when<00:01:18.180> you<00:01:18.360> land<00:01:18.540> it<00:01:18.630> like<00:01:18.810> a<00:01:18.840> big<00:01:19.049> jump<00:01:19.229> in

00:01:19.370 --> 00:01:19.380 
for when you land it like a big jump in

00:01:19.380 --> 00:01:22.940 
for when you land it like a big jump in
like<00:01:19.530> that<00:01:20.990> go<00:01:21.990> for<00:01:22.110> a<00:01:22.200> comment<00:01:22.500> like<00:01:22.560> that<00:01:22.619> as

00:01:22.940 --> 00:01:22.950 
like that go for a comment like that as

00:01:22.950 --> 00:01:24.340 
like that go for a comment like that as
you<00:01:23.040> can<00:01:23.100> see<00:01:23.280> a<00:01:23.310> lot<00:01:23.460> of<00:01:23.490> damage<00:01:23.700> their

00:01:24.340 --> 00:01:24.350 
you can see a lot of damage their

00:01:24.350 --> 00:01:26.840 
you can see a lot of damage their
special<00:01:25.350> moves<00:01:25.500> a<00:01:25.650> lot<00:01:25.860> of<00:01:25.979> them<00:01:26.100> are<00:01:26.369> pretty

00:01:26.840 --> 00:01:26.850 
special moves a lot of them are pretty

00:01:26.850 --> 00:01:28.219 
special moves a lot of them are pretty
much<00:01:27.060> familiar<00:01:27.450> with<00:01:27.540> what<00:01:27.689> you'd<00:01:27.810> expect<00:01:27.960> the

00:01:28.219 --> 00:01:28.229 
much familiar with what you'd expect the

00:01:28.229 --> 00:01:29.749 
much familiar with what you'd expect the
legs<00:01:28.439> as<00:01:28.619> a<00:01:28.650> motion<00:01:29.040> in<00:01:29.130> this<00:01:29.220> game<00:01:29.460> though<00:01:29.610> its

00:01:29.749 --> 00:01:29.759 
legs as a motion in this game though its

00:01:29.759 --> 00:01:31.700 
legs as a motion in this game though its
Korsak<00:01:30.060> afford<00:01:30.329> kick<00:01:30.509> that's<00:01:31.290> the<00:01:31.409> medium

00:01:31.700 --> 00:01:31.710 
Korsak afford kick that's the medium

00:01:31.710 --> 00:01:35.420 
Korsak afford kick that's the medium
that's<00:01:31.979> heavy<00:01:32.540> ax<00:01:33.540> to<00:01:34.229> settle<00:01:34.590> a<00:01:34.710> puzzle<00:01:35.250> safe

00:01:35.420 --> 00:01:35.430 
that's heavy ax to settle a puzzle safe

00:01:35.430 --> 00:01:36.770 
that's heavy ax to settle a puzzle safe
on<00:01:35.610> block<00:01:35.640> that's<00:01:36.030> a<00:01:36.150> knockdown<00:01:36.329> as<00:01:36.630> well

00:01:36.770 --> 00:01:36.780 
on block that's a knockdown as well

00:01:36.780 --> 00:01:38.390 
on block that's a knockdown as well
normally<00:01:37.200> legs<00:01:37.409> don't<00:01:37.650> knock<00:01:37.860> down<00:01:38.070> as<00:01:38.280> you

00:01:38.390 --> 00:01:38.400 
normally legs don't knock down as you

00:01:38.400 --> 00:01:40.750 
normally legs don't knock down as you
can<00:01:38.579> see<00:01:38.729> there<00:01:38.909> but<00:01:39.570> the<00:01:39.720> answer

00:01:40.750 --> 00:01:40.760 
can see there but the answer

00:01:40.760 --> 00:01:43.120 
can see there but the answer
walk<00:01:41.180> back<00:01:41.420> which<00:01:41.810> brings<00:01:42.140> up<00:01:42.350> her<00:01:42.530> fireball

00:01:43.120 --> 00:01:43.130 
walk back which brings up her fireball

00:01:43.130 --> 00:01:45.490 
walk back which brings up her fireball
to<00:01:43.760> the<00:01:43.880> charge<00:01:44.090> motion<00:01:44.540> heavy<00:01:45.020> fire<00:01:45.290> ball

00:01:45.490 --> 00:01:45.500 
to the charge motion heavy fire ball

00:01:45.500 --> 00:01:47.770 
to the charge motion heavy fire ball
doesn't<00:01:45.680> go<00:01:45.860> full<00:01:46.070> screen<00:01:46.300> just<00:01:47.300> loves<00:01:47.510> the<00:01:47.570> ex

00:01:47.770 --> 00:01:47.780 
doesn't go full screen just loves the ex

00:01:47.780 --> 00:01:49.990 
doesn't go full screen just loves the ex
looks<00:01:48.050> like<00:01:48.200> that<00:01:48.380> does<00:01:48.680> title<00:01:49.220> screen<00:01:49.430> light

00:01:49.990 --> 00:01:50.000 
looks like that does title screen light

00:01:50.000 --> 00:01:52.930 
looks like that does title screen light
goes<00:01:50.180> pretty<00:01:50.330> far<00:01:51.550> so<00:01:52.550> that's<00:01:52.700> what<00:01:52.850> her

00:01:52.930 --> 00:01:52.940 
goes pretty far so that's what her

00:01:52.940 --> 00:01:54.220 
goes pretty far so that's what her
fireball<00:01:53.330> looks<00:01:53.540> like<00:01:53.690> another<00:01:53.960> thing<00:01:54.140> to

00:01:54.220 --> 00:01:54.230 
fireball looks like another thing to

00:01:54.230 --> 00:01:55.510 
fireball looks like another thing to
note<00:01:54.260> about<00:01:54.410> legs<00:01:54.800> is<00:01:55.010> you<00:01:55.130> can<00:01:55.250> do<00:01:55.340> them<00:01:55.430> in

00:01:55.510 --> 00:01:55.520 
note about legs is you can do them in

00:01:55.520 --> 00:01:57.250 
note about legs is you can do them in
the<00:01:55.580> air<00:01:55.730> as<00:01:55.850> well<00:01:56.060> and<00:01:56.330> they<00:01:56.810> change<00:01:57.110> your

00:01:57.250 --> 00:01:57.260 
the air as well and they change your

00:01:57.260 --> 00:01:59.080 
the air as well and they change your
jump<00:01:57.500> are<00:01:57.680> pretty<00:01:57.980> drastically<00:01:58.400> I've<00:01:58.910> had<00:01:59.030> a

00:01:59.080 --> 00:01:59.090 
jump are pretty drastically I've had a

00:01:59.090 --> 00:02:00.910 
jump are pretty drastically I've had a
couple<00:01:59.270> times<00:01:59.540> where<00:01:59.900> someone<00:02:00.320> like<00:02:00.470> I<00:02:00.530> jump

00:02:00.910 --> 00:02:00.920 
couple times where someone like I jump

00:02:00.920 --> 00:02:02.470 
couple times where someone like I jump
and<00:02:01.160> I'm<00:02:01.280> gonna<00:02:01.400> get<00:02:01.580> hit<00:02:01.670> by<00:02:01.790> a<00:02:01.820> fireball<00:02:02.270> and

00:02:02.470 --> 00:02:02.480 
and I'm gonna get hit by a fireball and

00:02:02.480 --> 00:02:04.660 
and I'm gonna get hit by a fireball and
I<00:02:02.630> ve<00:02:02.780> exited<00:02:03.260> the<00:02:03.380> floor<00:02:03.590> or<00:02:03.950> regular<00:02:04.340> legs<00:02:04.550> or

00:02:04.660 --> 00:02:04.670 
I ve exited the floor or regular legs or

00:02:04.670 --> 00:02:05.680 
I ve exited the floor or regular legs or
similar<00:02:04.940> that<00:02:05.120> you<00:02:05.210> can<00:02:05.300> also<00:02:05.420> do<00:02:05.540> it<00:02:05.600> on

00:02:05.680 --> 00:02:05.690 
similar that you can also do it on

00:02:05.690 --> 00:02:07.420 
similar that you can also do it on
forward<00:02:05.990> jump<00:02:06.140> and<00:02:06.860> you<00:02:06.980> can<00:02:07.010> call<00:02:07.220> them<00:02:07.310> off

00:02:07.420 --> 00:02:07.430 
forward jump and you can call them off

00:02:07.430 --> 00:02:09.040 
forward jump and you can call them off
at<00:02:07.580> two<00:02:07.700> I'm<00:02:08.210> not<00:02:08.330> sure<00:02:08.390> exactly<00:02:08.899> which

00:02:09.040 --> 00:02:09.050 
at two I'm not sure exactly which

00:02:09.050 --> 00:02:10.420 
at two I'm not sure exactly which
versions<00:02:09.440> the<00:02:09.530> best<00:02:09.710> for<00:02:09.830> calling<00:02:10.160> off<00:02:10.250> bad

00:02:10.420 --> 00:02:10.430 
versions the best for calling off bad

00:02:10.430 --> 00:02:12.160 
versions the best for calling off bad
and<00:02:10.610> really<00:02:10.670> test<00:02:11.000> it<00:02:11.120> too<00:02:11.270> much<00:02:11.420> but<00:02:11.990> that's

00:02:12.160 --> 00:02:12.170 
and really test it too much but that's

00:02:12.170 --> 00:02:13.360 
and really test it too much but that's
what<00:02:12.260> I<00:02:12.320> gonna<00:02:12.470> change<00:02:12.740> closer<00:02:13.040> to<00:02:13.190> the<00:02:13.280> real

00:02:13.360 --> 00:02:13.370 
what I gonna change closer to the real

00:02:13.370 --> 00:02:15.250 
what I gonna change closer to the real
game<00:02:13.580> anyway<00:02:13.850> so<00:02:13.910> who<00:02:14.270> knows<00:02:14.390> you<00:02:14.990> can<00:02:15.080> do<00:02:15.170> that

00:02:15.250 --> 00:02:15.260 
game anyway so who knows you can do that

00:02:15.260 --> 00:02:17.020 
game anyway so who knows you can do that
off<00:02:15.410> of<00:02:15.530> her<00:02:15.740> v<00:02:16.220> skill<00:02:16.460> as<00:02:16.580> well<00:02:16.610> which<00:02:16.880> will

00:02:17.020 --> 00:02:17.030 
off of her v skill as well which will

00:02:17.030 --> 00:02:18.550 
off of her v skill as well which will
get<00:02:17.150> into<00:02:17.180> her<00:02:17.750> other<00:02:17.930> special<00:02:18.200> move<00:02:18.320> she<00:02:18.470> has

00:02:18.550 --> 00:02:18.560 
get into her other special move she has

00:02:18.560 --> 00:02:20.110 
get into her other special move she has
spinning<00:02:18.890> burg<00:02:19.040> still<00:02:19.340> looks<00:02:19.580> like<00:02:19.700> that<00:02:19.880> it

00:02:20.110 --> 00:02:20.120 
spinning burg still looks like that it

00:02:20.120 --> 00:02:22.600 
spinning burg still looks like that it
is<00:02:20.300> a<00:02:20.330> knockdown<00:02:20.570> the<00:02:21.010> X<00:02:22.010> version<00:02:22.190> looks<00:02:22.400> like

00:02:22.600 --> 00:02:22.610 
is a knockdown the X version looks like

00:02:22.610 --> 00:02:25.300 
is a knockdown the X version looks like
that<00:02:23.110> so<00:02:24.110> yeah<00:02:24.260> that's<00:02:24.440> pretty<00:02:24.830> much<00:02:25.010> it<00:02:25.160> for

00:02:25.300 --> 00:02:25.310 
that so yeah that's pretty much it for

00:02:25.310 --> 00:02:27.010 
that so yeah that's pretty much it for
Chumley<00:02:25.760> special<00:02:26.150> moves<00:02:26.330> she's<00:02:26.660> never<00:02:26.810> been

00:02:27.010 --> 00:02:27.020 
Chumley special moves she's never been

00:02:27.020 --> 00:02:28.420 
Chumley special moves she's never been
really<00:02:27.170> that<00:02:27.380> complicated<00:02:27.590> as<00:02:28.040> far<00:02:28.220> as<00:02:28.340> that

00:02:28.420 --> 00:02:28.430 
really that complicated as far as that

00:02:28.430 --> 00:02:30.610 
really that complicated as far as that
goes<00:02:28.490> so<00:02:29.240> Hervey<00:02:29.690> skill<00:02:30.020> is<00:02:30.170> really<00:02:30.380> unique

00:02:30.610 --> 00:02:30.620 
goes so Hervey skill is really unique

00:02:30.620 --> 00:02:32.380 
goes so Hervey skill is really unique
it's<00:02:30.860> very<00:02:31.010> aggressive<00:02:31.550> it's<00:02:31.790> a<00:02:31.880> far-ranging

00:02:32.380 --> 00:02:32.390 
it's very aggressive it's a far-ranging

00:02:32.390 --> 00:02:34.390 
it's very aggressive it's a far-ranging
jump<00:02:32.930> one<00:02:33.110> of<00:02:33.230> the<00:02:33.350> problems<00:02:33.709> china<00:02:33.980> has<00:02:34.160> her

00:02:34.390 --> 00:02:34.400 
jump one of the problems china has her

00:02:34.400 --> 00:02:36.610 
jump one of the problems china has her
jump<00:02:34.670> doesn't<00:02:34.880> go<00:02:35.090> very<00:02:35.120> far<00:02:35.330> horizontally<00:02:35.660> so

00:02:36.610 --> 00:02:36.620 
jump doesn't go very far horizontally so

00:02:36.620 --> 00:02:37.960 
jump doesn't go very far horizontally so
this<00:02:36.770> is<00:02:36.800> a<00:02:36.890> really<00:02:37.040> a<00:02:37.160> farther<00:02:37.520> way<00:02:37.700> for<00:02:37.880> her

00:02:37.960 --> 00:02:37.970 
this is a really a farther way for her

00:02:37.970 --> 00:02:40.270 
this is a really a farther way for her
to<00:02:38.000> cover<00:02:38.240> distance<00:02:38.720> across<00:02:39.140> the<00:02:39.380> screen<00:02:39.590> it's

00:02:40.270 --> 00:02:40.280 
to cover distance across the screen it's

00:02:40.280 --> 00:02:41.830 
to cover distance across the screen it's
pretty<00:02:40.520> nice<00:02:40.640> actually<00:02:40.700> defer<00:02:41.360> to<00:02:41.510> have<00:02:41.660> this

00:02:41.830 --> 00:02:41.840 
pretty nice actually defer to have this

00:02:41.840 --> 00:02:43.840 
pretty nice actually defer to have this

good<00:04:16.730> as<00:04:16.850> well<00:04:17.019> looks<00:04:18.019> like<00:04:18.230> that<00:04:18.500> you<00:04:18.650> confirm

00:04:18.970 --> 00:04:18.980 
good as well looks like that you confirm

00:04:18.980 --> 00:04:20.470 
good as well looks like that you confirm
off<00:04:19.160> it<00:04:19.370> off<00:04:19.519> like<00:04:19.760> a<00:04:19.790> little<00:04:19.970> Ford<00:04:20.120> legs<00:04:20.299> over

00:04:20.470 --> 00:04:20.480 
off it off like a little Ford legs over

00:04:20.480 --> 00:04:22.810 
off it off like a little Ford legs over
there<00:04:20.739> pretty<00:04:21.739> great<00:04:21.920> so<00:04:22.220> chun-li<00:04:22.490> is<00:04:22.640> very

00:04:22.810 --> 00:04:22.820 
there pretty great so chun-li is very

00:04:22.820 --> 00:04:24.670 
there pretty great so chun-li is very
simple<00:04:23.090> in<00:04:23.180> the<00:04:23.210> team<00:04:23.480> she's<00:04:23.810> a<00:04:23.870> lot<00:04:24.020> about<00:04:24.140> the

00:04:24.670 --> 00:04:24.680 
simple in the team she's a lot about the

00:04:24.680 --> 00:04:27.070 
simple in the team she's a lot about the
offense<00:04:25.580> is<00:04:25.790> a<00:04:25.850> really<00:04:26.180> great<00:04:26.270> answer<00:04:26.660> she<00:04:26.990> has

00:04:27.070 --> 00:04:27.080 
offense is a really great answer she has

00:04:27.080 --> 00:04:28.750 
offense is a really great answer she has
some<00:04:27.170> really<00:04:27.290> good<00:04:27.440> normals<00:04:27.800> as<00:04:27.890> well<00:04:28.070> and<00:04:28.340> the

00:04:28.750 --> 00:04:28.760 
some really good normals as well and the

00:04:28.760 --> 00:04:30.040 
some really good normals as well and the
one<00:04:28.910> thing<00:04:29.030> that<00:04:29.090> I'd<00:04:29.270> say<00:04:29.480> that<00:04:29.660> is<00:04:29.780> really

00:04:30.040 --> 00:04:30.050 
one thing that I'd say that is really

00:04:30.050 --> 00:04:31.600 
one thing that I'd say that is really
her<00:04:30.140> benefit<00:04:30.560> is<00:04:30.680> her<00:04:30.800> walk<00:04:31.040> speed<00:04:31.280> her<00:04:31.430> walk

00:04:31.600 --> 00:04:31.610 
her benefit is her walk speed her walk

00:04:31.610 --> 00:04:33.370 
her benefit is her walk speed her walk
speed<00:04:31.820> is<00:04:31.910> incredible<00:04:32.150> probably<00:04:32.780> the<00:04:32.990> fastest

00:04:33.370 --> 00:04:33.380 
speed is incredible probably the fastest

00:04:33.380 --> 00:04:35.410 
speed is incredible probably the fastest
in<00:04:33.470> the<00:04:33.500> game<00:04:33.710> so<00:04:33.920> far<00:04:34.100> it's<00:04:34.760> really<00:04:35.000> good<00:04:35.150> so

00:04:35.410 --> 00:04:35.420 
in the game so far it's really good so

00:04:35.420 --> 00:04:37.150 
in the game so far it's really good so
yeah<00:04:36.320> that's<00:04:36.440> pretty<00:04:36.560> much<00:04:36.710> the<00:04:36.830> Chumley

00:04:37.150 --> 00:04:37.160 
yeah that's pretty much the Chumley

00:04:37.160 --> 00:04:38.410 
yeah that's pretty much the Chumley
character<00:04:37.520> breakdown<00:04:37.640> a<00:04:37.880> lot<00:04:38.150> of<00:04:38.240> this<00:04:38.330> is

00:04:38.410 --> 00:04:38.420 
character breakdown a lot of this is

00:04:38.420 --> 00:04:40.000 
character breakdown a lot of this is
probably<00:04:38.570> gonna<00:04:38.720> change<00:04:39.050> once<00:04:39.470> we're<00:04:39.740> closer

00:04:40.000 --> 00:04:40.010 
probably gonna change once we're closer

00:04:40.010 --> 00:04:41.860 
probably gonna change once we're closer
to<00:04:40.370> the<00:04:40.490> end<00:04:40.610> of<00:04:40.700> this<00:04:40.790> thing<00:04:41.000> when<00:04:41.660> the<00:04:41.720> game

00:04:41.860 --> 00:04:41.870

00:04:41.870 --> 00:04:43.120 
to the end of this thing when the game
