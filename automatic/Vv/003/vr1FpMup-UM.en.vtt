00:01:07.160 --> 00:01:07.170 
still commonly used it also has a sedate

00:01:07.170 --> 00:01:10.490 
still commonly used it also has a sedate
you<00:01:07.350> and<00:01:07.500> hypnotic<00:01:08.159> properties<00:01:09.090> but<00:01:09.689> as<00:01:09.930> with

00:01:10.490 --> 00:01:10.500 
you and hypnotic properties but as with

00:01:10.500 --> 00:01:12.410 
you and hypnotic properties but as with
the<00:01:10.590> other<00:01:10.799> barbiturates<00:01:11.640> it<00:01:11.909> has<00:01:12.150> been

00:01:12.410 --> 00:01:12.420 
the other barbiturates it has been

00:01:12.420 --> 00:01:15.140 
the other barbiturates it has been
superseded<00:01:13.409> by<00:01:13.439> the<00:01:13.700> benzodiazepines<00:01:14.700> for

00:01:15.140 --> 00:01:15.150 
superseded by the benzodiazepines for

00:01:15.150 --> 00:01:19.070 
superseded by the benzodiazepines for
these<00:01:15.860> indications<00:01:17.390> so<00:01:18.390> these<00:01:18.810> are<00:01:18.990> the

00:01:19.070 --> 00:01:19.080 
these indications so these are the

00:01:19.080 --> 00:01:22.130 
these indications so these are the
indications<00:01:19.530> for<00:01:20.030> phenobarbital<00:01:21.030> or<00:01:21.780> a

00:01:22.130 --> 00:01:22.140 
indications for phenobarbital or a

00:01:22.140 --> 00:01:24.560 
indications for phenobarbital or a
phenobarbital<00:01:22.530> what<00:01:23.520> you<00:01:23.610> call<00:01:23.820> that<00:01:24.030> uses<00:01:24.390> is

00:01:24.560 --> 00:01:24.570 
phenobarbital what you call that uses is

00:01:24.570 --> 00:01:26.210 
phenobarbital what you call that uses is
a<00:01:24.630> one<00:01:24.900> of<00:01:25.020> the<00:01:25.110> cheapest<00:01:25.560> and<00:01:25.830> the<00:01:25.979> least

00:01:26.210 --> 00:01:26.220 
a one of the cheapest and the least

00:01:26.220 --> 00:01:29.450 
a one of the cheapest and the least
toxic<00:01:26.520> and<00:01:26.909> tear<00:01:27.210> ant<00:01:27.450> Apple<00:01:28.140> optics<00:01:28.500> ok<00:01:29.189> so<00:01:29.250> it

00:01:29.450 --> 00:01:29.460 
toxic and tear ant Apple optics ok so it

00:01:29.460 --> 00:01:31.280 
toxic and tear ant Apple optics ok so it
is<00:01:29.549> used<00:01:29.790> in<00:01:29.970> a<00:01:30.060> generalized<00:01:30.450> tonic-clonic

00:01:31.280 --> 00:01:31.290 
is used in a generalized tonic-clonic

00:01:31.290 --> 00:01:34.130 
is used in a generalized tonic-clonic
simple<00:01:32.070> partial<00:01:32.360> complex<00:01:33.360> partial<00:01:33.630> seizures

00:01:34.130 --> 00:01:34.140 
simple partial complex partial seizures

00:01:34.140 --> 00:01:38.030 
simple partial complex partial seizures
okay<00:01:34.409> so<00:01:35.780> it<00:01:36.780> can<00:01:37.020> be<00:01:37.140> used<00:01:37.320> for<00:01:37.530> our<00:01:37.680> status

00:01:38.030 --> 00:01:38.040 
okay so it can be used for our status

00:01:38.040 --> 00:01:40.789 
okay so it can be used for our status
epilepticus<00:01:38.600> so<00:01:39.600> let<00:01:40.170> me<00:01:40.320> start<00:01:40.560> with<00:01:40.680> this

00:01:40.789 --> 00:01:40.799 
epilepticus so let me start with this

00:01:40.799 --> 00:01:42.560 
epilepticus so let me start with this
mechanism<00:01:41.369> of<00:01:41.430> fraction<00:01:41.759> how<00:01:41.970> does<00:01:42.210> it<00:01:42.329> acts

00:01:42.560 --> 00:01:42.570 
mechanism of fraction how does it acts

00:01:42.570 --> 00:01:46.850 
mechanism of fraction how does it acts
the<00:01:43.470> gaba<00:01:44.130> G<00:01:44.549> a<00:01:44.820> B<00:01:45.270> a<00:01:45.299> a<00:01:45.750> receptor<00:01:46.530> that<00:01:46.680> is<00:01:46.799> a

00:01:46.850 --> 00:01:46.860 
the gaba G a B a a receptor that is a

00:01:46.860 --> 00:01:49.940 
the gaba G a B a a receptor that is a
receptors<00:01:47.520> are<00:01:47.939> primarily<00:01:48.659> primary<00:01:49.530> target

00:01:49.940 --> 00:01:49.950 
receptors are primarily primary target

00:01:49.950 --> 00:01:51.530 
receptors are primarily primary target
of<00:01:50.040> the<00:01:50.159> barbiturates<00:01:50.820> in<00:01:51.000> the<00:01:51.149> central

00:01:51.530 --> 00:01:51.540 
of the barbiturates in the central

00:01:51.540 --> 00:01:53.359 
of the barbiturates in the central
nervous<00:01:51.659> system<00:01:51.899> so<00:01:52.170> it<00:01:52.409> acts<00:01:52.560> on<00:01:52.680> a<00:01:52.950> receptor

00:01:53.359 --> 00:01:53.369 
nervous system so it acts on a receptor

00:01:53.369 --> 00:01:57.649 
nervous system so it acts on a receptor
so<00:01:53.460> for<00:01:53.610> gaba<00:01:54.020> as<00:01:55.020> in<00:01:55.590> as<00:01:55.920> is<00:01:56.670> the<00:01:57.149> case<00:01:57.360> for

so for gaba as in as is the case for

00:01:57.659 --> 00:01:59.480 
so for gaba as in as is the case for
