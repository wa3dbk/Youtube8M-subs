most heavily armored tanks in the game

00:00:36.899 --> 00:00:39.889 
most heavily armored tanks in the game
besides<00:00:37.200> the<00:00:37.410> t95<00:00:38.239> impenetrable<00:00:39.239> from<00:00:39.750> one

00:00:39.889 --> 00:00:39.899 
besides the t95 impenetrable from one

00:00:39.899 --> 00:00:42.799 
besides the t95 impenetrable from one
angle<00:00:40.050> when<00:00:40.980> its<00:00:41.100> advancing<00:00:41.579> fourth<00:00:41.850> doesn't

00:00:42.799 --> 00:00:42.809 
angle when its advancing fourth doesn't

00:00:42.809 --> 00:00:45.740 
angle when its advancing fourth doesn't
even<00:00:42.930> need<00:00:43.200> you<00:00:44.040> know<00:00:44.160> doesn't<00:00:44.579> even<00:00:44.670> need<00:00:44.969> hey

00:00:45.740 --> 00:00:45.750 
even need you know doesn't even need hey

00:00:45.750 --> 00:00:48.740 
even need you know doesn't even need hey
a<00:00:46.500> hold<00:00:46.920> downs<00:00:47.190> position<00:00:48.149> in<00:00:48.270> order<00:00:48.510> to<00:00:48.629> be

00:00:48.740 --> 00:00:48.750 
a hold downs position in order to be

00:00:48.750 --> 00:00:50.479 
a hold downs position in order to be
impenetrable<00:00:49.079> if<00:00:49.649> this<00:00:49.829> tank<00:00:50.070> is<00:00:50.160> just<00:00:50.399> an

00:00:50.479 --> 00:00:50.489 
impenetrable if this tank is just an

00:00:50.489 --> 00:00:53.770 
impenetrable if this tank is just an
absolute<00:00:50.579> beast<00:00:50.910> so<00:00:51.829> yeah<00:00:52.829> we<00:00:53.010> are<00:00:53.129> on

00:00:53.770 --> 00:00:53.780 
absolute beast so yeah we are on

00:00:53.780 --> 00:00:55.580 
absolute beast so yeah we are on
Copperfield<00:00:54.780> and<00:00:54.930> it<00:00:55.050> looks<00:00:55.230> like<00:00:55.320> ya

00:00:55.580 --> 00:00:55.590 
Copperfield and it looks like ya

00:00:55.590 --> 00:00:58.639 
Copperfield and it looks like ya
Copperfield<00:00:56.160> and<00:00:56.809> the<00:00:57.809> mouse<00:00:57.989> is<00:00:58.020> basically

00:00:58.639 --> 00:00:58.649 
Copperfield and the mouse is basically

00:00:58.649 --> 00:01:01.670 
Copperfield and the mouse is basically
why<00:00:58.829> is<00:00:58.890> so<00:00:59.160> p<00:00:59.489> is<00:00:59.730> because<00:01:00.329> it<00:01:00.960> can<00:01:01.500> basically

00:01:01.670 --> 00:01:01.680 
why is so p is because it can basically

00:01:01.680 --> 00:01:04.820 
why is so p is because it can basically
hold<00:01:02.399> an<00:01:02.640> entire<00:01:03.059> enemy<00:01:03.480> team<00:01:03.989> all<00:01:04.350> seven<00:01:04.769> of

00:01:04.820 --> 00:01:04.830 
hold an entire enemy team all seven of

00:01:04.830 --> 00:01:08.270 
hold an entire enemy team all seven of
them<00:01:05.040> from<00:01:05.729> advancing<00:01:06.270> forth<00:01:06.600> oh<00:01:07.100> so<00:01:08.100> that's

00:01:08.270 --> 00:01:08.280 
them from advancing forth oh so that's

00:01:08.280 --> 00:01:10.130 
them from advancing forth oh so that's
just<00:01:08.460> pretty<00:01:08.850> much<00:01:09.090> why<00:01:09.330> the<00:01:09.390> mouse<00:01:09.659> is<00:01:09.689> just

00:01:10.130 --> 00:01:10.140 
just pretty much why the mouse is just

00:01:10.140 --> 00:01:11.899 
just pretty much why the mouse is just
do<00:01:10.619> the<00:01:10.740> absolute<00:01:10.860> beast<00:01:11.250> is<00:01:11.430> because<00:01:11.670> it<00:01:11.790> can

00:01:11.899 --> 00:01:11.909 
do the absolute beast is because it can

00:01:11.909 --> 00:01:15.080 
do the absolute beast is because it can
stop<00:01:12.150> entire<00:01:12.900> enemy<00:01:13.110> teams<00:01:13.640> so<00:01:14.640> yeah<00:01:14.880> that's

00:01:15.080 --> 00:01:15.090 
stop entire enemy teams so yeah that's

00:01:15.090 --> 00:01:17.120 
stop entire enemy teams so yeah that's
pretty<00:01:15.540> much<00:01:15.900> all<00:01:16.049> you<00:01:16.110> need<00:01:16.350> to<00:01:16.500> know<00:01:16.950> about

00:01:17.120 --> 00:01:17.130 
pretty much all you need to know about

00:01:17.130 --> 00:01:20.510 
pretty much all you need to know about
it<00:01:17.430> except<00:01:17.790> return<00:01:18.210> is<00:01:18.450> very<00:01:18.960> very<00:01:19.320> weak<00:01:19.650> and

00:01:20.510 --> 00:01:20.520 
it except return is very very weak and

00:01:20.520 --> 00:01:23.090 
it except return is very very weak and
it's<00:01:21.450> just<00:01:21.810> that's<00:01:22.530> pretty<00:01:22.830> much<00:01:22.950> the<00:01:23.009> only

00:01:23.090 --> 00:01:23.100 
it's just that's pretty much the only

00:01:23.100 --> 00:01:25.399 
it's just that's pretty much the only
weak<00:01:23.400> spot<00:01:23.640> it<00:01:23.820> may<00:01:23.909> be<00:01:23.970> to<00:01:24.240> the<00:01:24.420> turn<00:01:24.600> is<00:01:24.810> 240

00:01:25.399 --> 00:01:25.409 
weak spot it may be to the turn is 240

00:01:25.409 --> 00:01:28.460 
weak spot it may be to the turn is 240
millimeters<00:01:25.860> thick<00:01:26.100> but<00:01:27.259> there's<00:01:28.259> a<00:01:28.320> very

00:01:28.460 --> 00:01:28.470 
millimeters thick but there's a very

00:01:28.470 --> 00:01:30.770 
millimeters thick but there's a very
flat<00:01:28.770> surface<00:01:29.369> on<00:01:29.579> the<00:01:29.970> cheeks<00:01:30.240> that<00:01:30.479> you<00:01:30.600> can

00:01:30.770 --> 00:01:30.780 
flat surface on the cheeks that you can

00:01:30.780 --> 00:01:33.440 
flat surface on the cheeks that you can
hit<00:01:30.960> and<00:01:31.200> which<00:01:32.070> makes<00:01:32.280> it<00:01:32.430> flat<00:01:32.700> and<00:01:32.970> very

00:01:33.440 --> 00:01:33.450 
hit and which makes it flat and very

00:01:33.450 --> 00:01:35.840 
hit and which makes it flat and very
easy<00:01:33.900> to<00:01:33.990> go<00:01:34.170> through<00:01:34.439> reliably<00:01:34.979> so<00:01:35.579> yeah

00:01:35.840 --> 00:01:35.850 
easy to go through reliably so yeah

00:01:35.850 --> 00:01:37.609 
easy to go through reliably so yeah
that's<00:01:36.000> uh<00:01:36.299> it's<00:01:36.720> almost<00:01:36.930> even<00:01:37.200> better<00:01:37.380> to<00:01:37.530> go

00:01:37.609 --> 00:01:37.619 
that's uh it's almost even better to go

00:01:37.619 --> 00:01:39.620 
that's uh it's almost even better to go
for<00:01:37.829> the<00:01:38.040> turret<00:01:38.520> rather<00:01:39.150> than<00:01:39.360> the<00:01:39.479> lower

00:01:39.620 --> 00:01:39.630 
for the turret rather than the lower

00:01:39.630 --> 00:01:42.469 
for the turret rather than the lower
plate<00:01:39.869> as<00:01:40.020> lower<00:01:40.229> plate<00:01:40.530> is<00:01:40.979> well<00:01:41.880> angled<00:01:42.329> and

00:01:42.469 --> 00:01:42.479 
plate as lower plate is well angled and

00:01:42.479 --> 00:01:46.609 
plate as lower plate is well angled and
200<00:01:42.899> millimeters<00:01:43.259> thick<00:01:43.470> so<00:01:44.369> yeah<00:01:45.259> mostly<00:01:46.259> why

00:01:46.609 --> 00:01:46.619 
200 millimeters thick so yeah mostly why

00:01:46.619 --> 00:01:48.950 
200 millimeters thick so yeah mostly why
I<00:01:46.649> uploaded<00:01:47.100> this<00:01:47.310> video<00:01:47.490> I<00:01:47.700> suppose<00:01:48.149> is<00:01:48.450> I

kind of a recreation of World of Tanks
it's<00:02:57.489> a<00:02:57.760> slower<00:02:58.120> paced<00:02:58.570> version<00:02:59.079> of<00:02:59.170> World<00:02:59.320> of

00:02:59.460 --> 00:02:59.470 
it's a slower paced version of World of

00:02:59.470 --> 00:03:02.789 
it's a slower paced version of World of
Tanks<00:02:59.650> and<00:03:00.220> sometimes<00:03:01.209> it's<00:03:01.750> just<00:03:02.019> a<00:03:02.320> bit<00:03:02.500> too

00:03:02.789 --> 00:03:02.799 
Tanks and sometimes it's just a bit too

00:03:02.799 --> 00:03:05.100 
Tanks and sometimes it's just a bit too
realistic<00:03:03.130> that<00:03:03.519> tanks<00:03:03.910> worse<00:03:04.150> my<00:03:04.630> computer

00:03:05.100 --> 00:03:05.110 
realistic that tanks worse my computer

00:03:05.110 --> 00:03:08.460

00:03:08.460 --> 00:03:08.470 
can barely handle the game and it's just

00:03:08.470 --> 00:03:12.390 
can barely handle the game and it's just
not<00:03:08.739> really<00:03:09.370> enjoyable<00:03:09.910> for<00:03:10.239> me<00:03:10.829> so<00:03:11.829> yeah
