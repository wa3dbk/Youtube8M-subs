00:00:00.620 --> 00:00:05.400
 Hey guys, Martin, talking about the video. 

00:00:03.929 --> 00:00:08.610
 I bring you this call today. 

00:00:05.400 --> 00:00:10.830
 black ops 2 and good today I'll bring 

00:00:08.610 --> 00:00:12.809
 problems some tips whose goal 

00:00:10.830 --> 00:00:15.269
 these tips is to improve your 

00:00:12.809 --> 00:00:20.609
 Performance in black ops 2 in safe 

00:00:15.269 --> 00:00:22.410
 multiplayer online and this tip is not only 

00:00:20.609 --> 00:00:24.779
 for those who do not know how to play the game for 

00:00:22.410 --> 00:00:26.519
 Who has some difficulty is for everything. 

00:00:24.779 --> 00:00:29.580
 world even hope it helps 

00:00:26.519 --> 00:00:30.990
 good let's get the first tip that 

00:00:29.580 --> 00:00:33.570
 I would like to bring it to you, that's how it is 

00:00:30.990 --> 00:00:34.950
 when you enter a game late and 

00:00:33.570 --> 00:00:37.140
 online sheet 

00:00:34.950 --> 00:00:41.070
 the best thing you can do to 

00:00:37.140 --> 00:00:43.110
 principle is to define a class that is is 

00:00:41.070 --> 00:00:45.090
 you can set 

00:00:43.110 --> 00:00:46.680
 have to define what you will be the 

00:00:45.090 --> 00:00:49.230
 win game if that player more 

00:00:46.680 --> 00:00:52.350
 hardcore or else if you will be more 

00:00:49.230 --> 00:00:53.550
 tactical, but strategic , 

00:00:52.350 --> 00:00:55.199
 When you do that, it gets very 

00:00:53.550 --> 00:00:57.210
 the easier you know the weapon that 

00:00:55.199 --> 00:00:58.890
 Are you going to play and what are you going to do? 

00:00:57.210 --> 00:01:02.550
 depending on the game situation of this 

00:00:58.890 --> 00:01:04.559
 next long good 

00:01:02.550 --> 00:01:07.770
 this is the first tip is very 

00:01:04.559 --> 00:01:09.510
 important then I trained I'm saying 

00:01:07.770 --> 00:01:13.640
 for you they will end up improving bigger 

00:01:09.510 --> 00:01:16.890
 another and now let's go to the second tip 

00:01:13.640 --> 00:01:18.930
 Good never want to go through the middle of the map. 

00:01:16.890 --> 00:01:20.580
 as long as you never meet him 

00:01:18.930 --> 00:01:22.590
 never want by the middle of a map 

00:01:20.580 --> 00:01:25.080
 because there are a lot of people shooting 

00:01:22.590 --> 00:01:27.270
 you will get totally exposed in 

00:01:25.080 --> 00:01:29.880
 a cover protection in the middle of the map 

00:01:27.270 --> 00:01:32.490
 without counting the good gradients that can 

00:01:29.880 --> 00:01:34.170
 stay giving some champion house and they 

00:01:32.490 --> 00:01:37.170
 They'll see you, they'll kill you. 

00:01:34.170 --> 00:01:40.290
 so I always try to contend for the sides 

00:01:37.170 --> 00:01:42.810
 the map and spinning around so it is not 

00:01:40.290 --> 00:01:45.899
 sure to shaolin and goes often 

00:01:42.810 --> 00:01:47.630
 surprised his enemy by killing him without 

00:01:45.899 --> 00:01:50.520
 nor does he know that you are there understood 

00:01:47.630 --> 00:01:53.899
 This is a valuable tip when I 

00:01:50.520 --> 00:01:55.799
 I learned to be much less organizational 

00:01:53.899 --> 00:01:56.670
 leading to the third hint was 

00:01:55.799 --> 00:01:58.380
 eliminated 

00:01:56.670 --> 00:02:00.899
 I was talking about maps of these 

00:01:58.380 --> 00:02:04.200
 second tip the next day I can not 

00:02:00.899 --> 00:02:05.570
 to tell you is that if you do not 

00:02:04.200 --> 00:02:08.610
 know the map 

00:02:05.570 --> 00:02:10.110
 fine play it the first time but 

00:02:08.610 --> 00:02:12.400
 You do not know them what I can. 

00:02:10.110 --> 00:02:17.300
 tell you what to do is as follows 

00:02:12.400 --> 00:02:19.460
 young local tastes and learn to 

00:02:17.300 --> 00:02:22.640
 play this map through which runs well 

00:02:19.460 --> 00:02:24.260
 telling him to let you know all the 

00:02:22.640 --> 00:02:26.450
 routes you will have to escape in case you 

00:02:24.260 --> 00:02:28.190
 play some damage or 

00:02:26.450 --> 00:02:30.230
 attack time even some place that does not 

00:02:28.190 --> 00:02:31.460
 Saturday his enemies will speak to 

00:02:30.230 --> 00:02:34.790
 you behind them 

00:02:31.460 --> 00:02:38.600
 This makes it much easier for your life to believe. 

00:02:34.790 --> 00:02:40.550
 so in relation to good putz 

00:02:38.600 --> 00:02:43.280
 everyone knows that they are provided 

00:02:40.550 --> 00:02:44.780
 by the videogame so they are not as 

00:02:43.280 --> 00:02:46.490
 good as a real person would be 

00:02:44.780 --> 00:02:49.190
 playing online with you 

00:02:46.490 --> 00:02:51.230
 however the purpose of these boots is to make 

00:02:49.190 --> 00:02:53.090
 what they did this is no secret 

00:02:51.230 --> 00:02:55.610
 that it reproduces without what a 

00:02:53.090 --> 00:02:57.950
 person would do it and often they would 

00:02:55.610 --> 00:02:59.810
 they can do it so if you play 

00:02:57.950 --> 00:03:01.490
 with butt you're just going to be 

00:02:59.810 --> 00:03:03.890
 preparing to play when multiplayer 

00:03:01.490 --> 00:03:05.810
 play online with someone because many 

00:03:03.890 --> 00:03:08.270
 things they do are similar 

00:03:05.810 --> 00:03:08.930
 those of a real person would do that 

00:03:08.270 --> 00:03:11.960
 very good 

00:03:08.930 --> 00:03:16.310
 the bonus was third on the second tip 

00:03:11.960 --> 00:03:19.520
 but finally the next is the next me 

00:03:16.310 --> 00:03:21.320
 never saw a crazy of the game its ridiculous is 

00:03:19.520 --> 00:03:22.300
 Awful you will not get anything with 

00:03:21.320 --> 00:03:25.190
 that 

00:03:22.300 --> 00:03:28.370
 so always think of something think 

00:03:25.190 --> 00:03:30.080
 on a plane use of his intelligence because 

00:03:28.370 --> 00:03:32.450
 even if you have the best weapon in the 

00:03:30.080 --> 00:03:34.160
 game even with its precision is 

00:03:32.450 --> 00:03:36.380
 amazing if you were not smart if 

00:03:34.160 --> 00:03:38.480
 You do not think of anything you're going to 

00:03:36.380 --> 00:03:41.650
 be simply absurd trying 

00:03:38.480 --> 00:03:41.650
 play and not achieved 

00:03:42.140 --> 00:03:49.040
 the floor now it's fundamental is you 

00:03:45.350 --> 00:03:51.080
 have to do this and that intelligence 

00:03:49.040 --> 00:03:53.569
 but always your best weapon because even 

00:03:51.080 --> 00:03:55.040
 with the person also in the case the enemy 

00:03:53.569 --> 00:03:56.930
 have the best weapon of your game 

00:03:55.040 --> 00:04:00.550
 intelligence your advantage over it goes 

00:03:56.930 --> 00:04:02.900
 be very large and can confirm 

00:04:00.550 --> 00:04:04.790
 adjusting wait and another when you 

00:04:02.900 --> 00:04:06.830
 to get the government confers him 

00:04:04.790 --> 00:04:08.930
 simply Brazil does not take shot of 

00:04:06.830 --> 00:04:10.870
 Someone is gay to think about what you're going to 

00:04:08.930 --> 00:04:13.220
 do to continue your move 

00:04:10.870 --> 00:04:14.840
 Because I think that's why they 

00:04:13.220 --> 00:04:17.739
 were made not only for you to hide 

00:04:14.840 --> 00:04:17.739
 in italy of you 

00:04:18.079 --> 00:04:24.140
 Good to today's tips were these 

00:04:21.140 --> 00:04:26.090
 I hope you enjoyed it 

00:04:24.140 --> 00:04:27.530
 wait to not operate has some more 

00:04:26.090 --> 00:04:29.120
 things I would like to tell you about yourself

 good the proposal for this channel 

00:04:31.160 --> 00:04:35.390
 I was thinking what's next ? 

00:04:33.050 --> 00:04:38.480
 I will try to bring at least two 

00:04:35.390 --> 00:04:41.390
 three videos per week for the channel and 

00:04:38.480 --> 00:04:43.100
 for now I think the two games 

00:04:41.390 --> 00:04:46.669
 I'll tackle an off cycle 

00:04:43.100 --> 00:04:48.169
