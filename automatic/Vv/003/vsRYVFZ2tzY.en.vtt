let him take a couple stops the other
thing<00:01:15.270> too<00:01:15.450> is<00:01:15.479> because<00:01:15.780> of<00:01:15.869> the<00:01:15.930> conditions

00:01:16.399 --> 00:01:16.409 
thing too is because of the conditions

00:01:16.409 --> 00:01:18.410 
thing too is because of the conditions
that<00:01:16.500> were<00:01:16.680> in<00:01:16.860> your<00:01:17.640> scanning<00:01:17.939> and<00:01:18.180> some<00:01:18.330> of

00:01:18.410 --> 00:01:18.420 
that were in your scanning and some of

00:01:18.420 --> 00:01:20.420 
that were in your scanning and some of
the<00:01:18.509> best<00:01:18.659> hay<00:01:18.930> fields<00:01:19.259> in<00:01:19.350> Louis<00:01:19.560> County<00:01:19.770> the

00:01:20.420 --> 00:01:20.430 
the best hay fields in Louis County the

00:01:20.430 --> 00:01:22.039 
the best hay fields in Louis County the
chlorophyll<00:01:21.060> that<00:01:21.090> are<00:01:21.270> in<00:01:21.360> these<00:01:21.479> fields<00:01:21.720> I'm

00:01:22.039 --> 00:01:22.049 
chlorophyll that are in these fields I'm

00:01:22.049 --> 00:01:24.020 
chlorophyll that are in these fields I'm
gonna<00:01:22.259> give<00:01:22.470> him<00:01:22.680> about<00:01:22.950> it<00:01:23.070> what<00:01:23.189> is<00:01:23.310> about<00:01:23.580> so

00:01:24.020 --> 00:01:24.030 
gonna give him about it what is about so

00:01:24.030 --> 00:01:24.499 
gonna give him about it what is about so

20<00:01:24.900> to<00:01:24.990> 30<00:01:26.600> creeping<00:01:27.600> I<00:01:28.020> don't<00:01:28.259> think<00:01:28.409> he<00:01:28.470> had

00:01:28.550 --> 00:01:28.560 
20 to 30 creeping I don't think he had

00:01:28.560 --> 00:01:30.170 
20 to 30 creeping I don't think he had
the<00:01:28.650> bird<00:01:28.799> tip<00:01:29.040> I<00:01:29.220> think<00:01:29.520> it<00:01:29.579> was<00:01:29.670> a<00:01:29.700> short<00:01:29.970> felt

00:01:30.170 --> 00:01:30.180 
the bird tip I think it was a short felt

00:01:30.180 --> 00:01:32.630 
the bird tip I think it was a short felt
it<00:01:30.270> was<00:01:30.360> quite<00:01:30.540> good<00:01:30.590> because<00:01:31.590> chlorophyll<00:01:32.430> is

00:01:32.630 --> 00:01:32.640 
it was quite good because chlorophyll is

00:01:32.640 --> 00:01:37.160 
it was quite good because chlorophyll is
how<00:01:32.939> your<00:01:33.390> mother<00:01:33.420> birds<00:01:33.990> cover<00:01:35.030> their<00:01:36.030> set<00:01:36.299> so

00:01:37.160 --> 00:01:37.170 
how your mother birds cover their set so

00:01:37.170 --> 00:01:39.140 
how your mother birds cover their set so
where<00:01:37.650> it's<00:01:37.860> such<00:01:38.159> a<00:01:38.189> heavy<00:01:38.490> field<00:01:38.850> that's<00:01:39.060> why

00:01:39.140 --> 00:01:39.150 
where it's such a heavy field that's why

00:01:39.150 --> 00:01:41.330 
where it's such a heavy field that's why
I<00:01:39.180> really<00:01:39.420> want<00:01:39.570> to<00:01:39.659> be<00:01:39.720> on<00:01:39.810> top<00:01:40.079> but<00:01:40.500> it's<00:01:41.130> too

00:01:41.330 --> 00:01:41.340 
I really want to be on top but it's too

00:01:41.340 --> 00:01:42.590 
I really want to be on top but it's too
wet<00:01:41.490> to<00:01:41.640> get<00:01:41.790> up<00:01:41.909> there<00:01:42.060> so<00:01:42.119> we're<00:01:42.329> sort<00:01:42.450> of<00:01:42.509> in

00:01:42.590 --> 00:01:42.600 
wet to get up there so we're sort of in

00:01:42.600 --> 00:01:44.030 
wet to get up there so we're sort of in
this<00:01:42.720> tweener<00:01:43.020> stage<00:01:43.350> so<00:01:43.560> that's<00:01:43.680> why<00:01:43.860> I'm

00:01:44.030 --> 00:01:44.040 
this tweener stage so that's why I'm

00:01:44.040 --> 00:01:46.310 
this tweener stage so that's why I'm
going<00:01:44.220> to<00:01:44.250> give<00:01:44.460> the<00:01:44.610> dog<00:01:44.850> to<00:01:45.750> benefit<00:01:46.140> of<00:01:46.229> the

00:01:46.310 --> 00:01:46.320 
going to give the dog to benefit of the

00:01:46.320 --> 00:01:48.560 
going to give the dog to benefit of the
doubt<00:01:46.500> all<00:01:47.340> right<00:01:47.460> in<00:01:47.939> my<00:01:48.090> benefit<00:01:48.390> because

00:01:48.560 --> 00:01:48.570 
doubt all right in my benefit because

00:01:48.570 --> 00:01:50.990 
doubt all right in my benefit because
the<00:01:48.750> way<00:01:48.869> his<00:01:49.020> head<00:01:49.229> was<00:01:49.409> turning<00:01:49.680> if<00:01:49.950> he'll<00:01:50.790> is

00:01:50.990 --> 00:01:51.000 
the way his head was turning if he'll is

00:01:51.000 --> 00:01:53.660 
the way his head was turning if he'll is
fixated<00:01:51.450> and<00:01:51.899> moving<00:01:52.560> in<00:01:52.710> this<00:01:52.860> way<00:01:53.070> I'd<00:01:53.460> say

00:01:53.660 --> 00:01:53.670 
fixated and moving in this way I'd say

00:01:53.670 --> 00:01:55.190 
fixated and moving in this way I'd say
oh<00:01:53.700> no<00:01:53.970> dude<00:01:54.149> you<00:01:54.299> got<00:01:54.450> that<00:01:54.600> burden<00:01:54.810> it's<00:01:55.079> out

00:01:55.190 --> 00:01:55.200 
oh no dude you got that burden it's out

00:01:55.200 --> 00:01:56.899 
oh no dude you got that burden it's out
of<00:01:55.229> that<00:01:55.439> but<00:01:55.860> you<00:01:55.979> saw<00:01:56.159> his<00:01:56.280> head<00:01:56.490> was<00:01:56.670> doing

00:01:56.899 --> 00:01:56.909 
of that but you saw his head was doing

00:01:56.909 --> 00:01:58.160 
of that but you saw his head was doing
this<00:01:57.060> as<00:01:57.270> ears<00:01:57.479> we're<00:01:57.659> back<00:01:57.780> it's<00:01:57.990> good<00:01:58.140> I

00:01:58.160 --> 00:01:58.170 
this as ears we're back it's good I

00:01:58.170 --> 00:01:59.149 
this as ears we're back it's good I
think<00:01:58.290> there's<00:01:58.590> something<00:01:58.740> here<00:01:58.950> someplace

00:01:59.149 --> 00:01:59.159 
think there's something here someplace

00:01:59.159 --> 00:02:02.120 
think there's something here someplace
and<00:01:59.549> then<00:02:00.270> you<00:02:00.390> notice<00:02:00.540> he<00:02:00.750> rocked<00:02:00.990> up<00:02:01.229> he<00:02:01.890> had

00:02:02.120 --> 00:02:02.130 
and then you notice he rocked up he had

00:02:02.130 --> 00:02:04.399 
and then you notice he rocked up he had
it<00:02:02.340> so<00:02:02.909> so<00:02:03.360> if<00:02:03.450> he<00:02:03.540> gets<00:02:03.719> close<00:02:03.930> to<00:02:03.960> them<00:02:04.290> about

00:02:04.399 --> 00:02:04.409 
it so so if he gets close to them about

00:02:04.409 --> 00:02:08.240 
it so so if he gets close to them about

air by flying the bird faster because

00:02:40.170 --> 00:02:41.179 
air by flying the bird faster because
then<00:02:40.290> we<00:02:40.379> would<00:02:40.500> have<00:02:40.530> gotten<00:02:40.739> to<00:02:40.799> stop<00:02:41.040> to

00:02:41.179 --> 00:02:41.189 
then we would have gotten to stop to

00:02:41.189 --> 00:02:43.399 
then we would have gotten to stop to
flush<00:02:41.400> then<00:02:42.299> to<00:02:42.420> fly<00:02:42.659> it<00:02:42.720> too<00:02:43.019> late

00:02:43.399 --> 00:02:43.409
