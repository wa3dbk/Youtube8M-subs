00:04:58.200 --> 00:05:00.710 
they are pretty slow so that and just
the<00:04:58.470> the<00:04:58.770> consensus<00:04:59.700> that<00:04:59.730> if<00:04:59.940> so<00:05:00.060> if<00:05:00.210> steam<00:05:00.540> is

00:05:00.710 --> 00:05:00.720 
the the consensus that if so if steam is

00:05:00.720 --> 00:05:02.840 
the the consensus that if so if steam is
acting<00:05:01.050> up<00:05:01.169> then<00:05:01.470> uninstall<00:05:02.220> it<00:05:02.250> and<00:05:02.430> install

00:05:02.840 --> 00:05:02.850 
acting up then uninstall it and install

00:05:02.850 --> 00:05:05.930 
acting up then uninstall it and install
it<00:05:02.880> is<00:05:03.090> kind<00:05:03.300> of<00:05:03.360> annoying<00:05:03.890> I<00:05:04.890> also<00:05:05.370> did<00:05:05.730> like

00:05:05.930 --> 00:05:05.940 
it is kind of annoying I also did like

00:05:05.940 --> 00:05:07.340 
it is kind of annoying I also did like
