00:04:29.820 --> 00:04:29.830 
probably the opinion probably wasn't

00:04:29.830 --> 00:04:33.840 
probably the opinion probably wasn't
enough<00:04:30.070> to<00:04:30.220> turn<00:04:30.430> the<00:04:32.400> negative<00:04:33.400> opinions

00:04:33.840 --> 00:04:33.850 
enough to turn the negative opinions

00:04:33.850 --> 00:04:35.400 
enough to turn the negative opinions
around<00:04:34.000> but<00:04:34.390> it<00:04:34.480> was<00:04:34.570> enough<00:04:34.840> to<00:04:34.990> get<00:04:35.110> some

00:04:35.400 --> 00:04:35.410 
around but it was enough to get some

00:04:35.410 --> 00:04:38.490 
around but it was enough to get some
people<00:04:35.860> at<00:04:36.130> least<00:04:36.900> thinking<00:04:37.900> positively

despite the fact that was evil cully out
I<00:05:26.800> countless<00:05:27.220> definitely<00:05:27.760> kick<00:05:27.970> ass<00:05:28.150> but<00:05:28.570> back

00:05:29.520 --> 00:05:29.530

to<00:05:29.560> my<00:05:29.860> main<00:05:30.070> point<00:05:30.340> I<00:05:30.640> don't<00:05:30.940> understand<00:05:31.450> why

00:05:31.620 --> 00:05:31.630 
to my main point I don't understand why

00:05:31.630 --> 00:05:35.100 
to my main point I don't understand why
cursing<00:05:32.080> network<00:05:32.410> would<00:05:33.250> just<00:05:33.940> air<00:05:34.810> this

00:05:35.100 --> 00:05:35.110 
cursing network would just air this

00:05:35.110 --> 00:05:38.060 
cursing network would just air this
episode<00:05:35.680> in<00:05:35.980> their<00:05:36.340> lineup<00:05:36.820> of<00:05:37.180> new<00:05:37.630> episodes

00:05:38.070 --> 00:05:40.440 
episode in their lineup of new episodes
I'm<00:05:39.070> guessing<00:05:39.490> got<00:05:39.669> the<00:05:39.760> one<00:05:39.910> that<00:05:40.090> premiered

00:05:40.440 --> 00:05:40.450 
I'm guessing got the one that premiered

00:05:40.450 --> 00:05:46.260 
I'm guessing got the one that premiered
last<00:05:40.540> week<00:05:40.810> was<00:05:41.500> episode<00:05:42.190> 14<00:05:42.730> maybe<00:05:44.820> it<00:05:45.820> seems

00:05:46.260 --> 00:05:46.270 
last week was episode 14 maybe it seems

00:05:46.270 --> 00:05:48.390 
last week was episode 14 maybe it seems
like<00:05:46.419> the<00:05:46.900> rest<00:05:47.110> episodes<00:05:47.650> are<00:05:47.860> taking<00:05:48.220> a

00:05:48.390 --> 00:05:48.400 
like the rest episodes are taking a

00:05:48.400 --> 00:05:50.790 
like the rest episodes are taking a
similar<00:05:49.150> turn<00:05:49.390> to<00:05:49.570> bend<00:05:49.780> 10<00:05:50.050> each<00:05:50.320> episode

00:05:50.790 --> 00:05:50.800 
similar turn to bend 10 each episode

00:05:50.800 --> 00:05:53.159 
similar turn to bend 10 each episode
pretty<00:05:51.070> much<00:05:51.220> has<00:05:51.430> its<00:05:51.580> own<00:05:51.730> plot<00:05:52.150> line<00:05:52.390> but

00:05:53.159 --> 00:05:53.169 
pretty much has its own plot line but

00:05:53.169 --> 00:05:57.390 
pretty much has its own plot line but
despite<00:05:53.530> that<00:05:54.180> did<00:05:55.590> the<00:05:56.590> Cartoon<00:05:57.070> Network

00:05:57.390 --> 00:05:57.400 
despite that did the Cartoon Network

00:05:57.400 --> 00:06:00.060 
despite that did the Cartoon Network
really<00:05:57.910> have<00:05:58.180> to<00:05:58.390> avoid<00:05:58.720> showing<00:05:59.080> it<00:05:59.440> I<00:05:59.590> say

00:06:00.060 --> 00:06:00.070 
really have to avoid showing it I say

00:06:00.070 --> 00:06:02.700

that<00:06:00.400> this<00:06:01.210> episode<00:06:01.750> despite<00:06:02.140> having<00:06:02.350> its<00:06:02.590> own

00:06:02.700 --> 00:06:02.710 
that this episode despite having its own

00:06:02.710 --> 00:06:05.730 
that this episode despite having its own
plot<00:06:03.070> that<00:06:03.400> really<00:06:03.790> builds<00:06:04.410> more<00:06:05.410> on

00:06:05.730 --> 00:06:05.740 
plot that really builds more on
