the<00:01:27.930> other<00:01:28.080> tip<00:01:28.440> I<00:01:28.620> would<00:01:28.680> recommend<00:01:29.490> if

00:01:29.630 --> 00:01:29.640 
the other tip I would recommend if

00:01:29.640 --> 00:01:31.220 
the other tip I would recommend if
you're<00:01:29.790> doing<00:01:30.000> any<00:01:30.270> type<00:01:30.390> of<00:01:30.600> hiking<00:01:30.930> where

00:01:34.100 --> 00:01:34.110 
wearing any kind of a pack they're going

00:01:34.110 --> 00:01:35.780 
wearing any kind of a pack they're going
on<00:01:34.260> reduced<00:01:34.560> it<00:01:34.680> is<00:01:34.830> built<00:01:35.040> up<00:01:35.220> half<00:01:35.430> the<00:01:35.580> size

00:01:35.780 --> 00:01:35.790 
on reduced it is built up half the size

00:01:35.790 --> 00:01:38.150 
on reduced it is built up half the size
it'll<00:01:36.450> feel<00:01:36.720> too<00:01:36.930> big<00:01:37.110> in<00:01:37.260> the<00:01:37.350> store<00:01:37.620> it'll

00:01:38.150 --> 00:01:38.160 
it'll feel too big in the store it'll

00:01:38.160 --> 00:01:39.620 
it'll feel too big in the store it'll
feel<00:01:38.340> great<00:01:38.700> on<00:01:38.730> your<00:01:38.850> foot<00:01:39.180> once<00:01:39.360> your<00:01:39.480> feet

00:01:39.620 --> 00:01:39.630 
feel great on your foot once your feet

00:01:39.630 --> 00:01:41.240 
feel great on your foot once your feet
start<00:01:39.870> swelling<00:01:40.170> and<00:01:40.470> they<00:01:40.560> will<00:01:40.800> swell<00:01:41.100> when

00:01:41.240 --> 00:01:41.250 
start swelling and they will swell when

00:01:41.250 --> 00:01:43.130 
start swelling and they will swell when
you're<00:01:41.370> hiking<00:01:41.690> especially<00:01:42.690> if<00:01:42.780> you<00:01:42.870> have<00:01:42.990> any

00:01:43.130 --> 00:01:43.140 
you're hiking especially if you have any

00:01:43.140 --> 00:01:44.780 
you're hiking especially if you have any
kind<00:01:43.320> of<00:01:43.410> weight<00:01:43.620> on<00:01:43.740> your<00:01:43.830> back<00:01:44.010> so<00:01:44.340> on<00:01:44.670> your

00:01:44.780 --> 00:01:44.790 
kind of weight on your back so on your

00:01:44.790 --> 00:01:46.160 
kind of weight on your back so on your
back<00:01:44.820> I<00:01:44.940> can<00:01:45.180> imagine<00:01:45.420> -<00:01:45.780> if<00:01:45.930> you're<00:01:46.050> going

00:01:46.160 --> 00:01:46.170 
back I can imagine - if you're going

00:01:46.170 --> 00:01:47.750 
back I can imagine - if you're going
uphill<00:01:46.410> and<00:01:46.770> downhill<00:01:47.040> you're<00:01:47.550> going

00:01:47.750 --> 00:01:47.760 
uphill and downhill you're going

00:01:47.760 --> 00:01:49.610 
uphill and downhill you're going
downhill<00:01:48.000> your<00:01:48.330> toes<00:01:48.630> tend<00:01:49.050> to<00:01:49.140> want<00:01:49.320> to<00:01:49.380> slide

00:01:49.610 --> 00:01:49.620 
downhill your toes tend to want to slide

00:01:49.620 --> 00:01:51.680 
downhill your toes tend to want to slide
to<00:01:49.860> the<00:01:49.950> front<00:01:50.310> of<00:01:50.370> the<00:01:50.430> chute<00:01:50.640> anyway<00:01:51.120> right

00:01:51.680 --> 00:01:51.690 
to the front of the chute anyway right

00:01:51.690 --> 00:01:53.360 
to the front of the chute anyway right
and<00:01:51.840> that's<00:01:51.990> another<00:01:52.230> great<00:01:52.530> reason<00:01:52.740> to<00:01:52.920> tie

00:01:53.360 --> 00:01:53.370 
and that's another great reason to tie

00:01:53.370 --> 00:01:54.000 
and that's another great reason to tie
your<00:01:53.490> shoes

00:01:54.000 --> 00:01:54.010 
your shoes

00:01:54.010 --> 00:01:56.520 
your shoes
so<00:01:55.000> use<00:01:55.180> your<00:01:55.300> imagination<00:01:55.390> pretend<00:01:56.260> this<00:01:56.410> as

00:01:56.520 --> 00:01:56.530 
so use your imagination pretend this as

00:01:56.530 --> 00:01:58.800 
so use your imagination pretend this as
a<00:01:56.560> hiking<00:01:56.950> shoe<00:01:57.150> one<00:01:58.150> thing<00:01:58.330> you<00:01:58.450> can<00:01:58.600> do<00:01:58.720> to

00:01:58.800 --> 00:01:58.810 
a hiking shoe one thing you can do to

00:01:58.810 --> 00:02:00.060 
a hiking shoe one thing you can do to
help<00:01:58.960> prevent<00:01:59.320> those<00:01:59.410> blisters<00:01:59.650> is<00:01:59.950> you're

00:02:00.060 --> 00:02:00.070 
help prevent those blisters is you're

00:02:00.070 --> 00:02:01.200 
help prevent those blisters is you're
going<00:02:00.190> to<00:02:00.250> actually<00:02:00.370> just<00:02:00.580> take<00:02:00.910> it<00:02:01.030> out<00:02:01.180> of

00:02:01.200 --> 00:02:01.210 
going to actually just take it out of

00:02:01.210 --> 00:02:03.780 
going to actually just take it out of
the<00:02:01.420> top<00:02:01.630> loop<00:02:01.870> of<00:02:01.990> your<00:02:02.080> shoe<00:02:02.640> you're<00:02:03.640> gonna

00:02:03.780 --> 00:02:03.790 
the top loop of your shoe you're gonna

00:02:03.790 --> 00:02:06.390 
the top loop of your shoe you're gonna
feed<00:02:04.090> it<00:02:04.210> back<00:02:04.330> through<00:02:04.720> on<00:02:04.900> the<00:02:05.020> same<00:02:05.230> side<00:02:05.560> so

00:02:06.390 --> 00:02:06.400 
feed it back through on the same side so

00:02:06.400 --> 00:02:07.609 
feed it back through on the same side so
see<00:02:06.550> how<00:02:06.610> there's<00:02:06.790> now<00:02:06.940> a<00:02:06.970> loop<00:02:07.270> on<00:02:07.420> the<00:02:07.540> top

00:02:07.609 --> 00:02:07.619 
see how there's now a loop on the top

00:02:07.619 --> 00:02:10.260 
see how there's now a loop on the top
and<00:02:08.619> then<00:02:08.860> once<00:02:09.040> your<00:02:09.190> foot<00:02:09.430> is<00:02:09.550> in<00:02:09.580> there<00:02:09.910> the

00:02:10.260 --> 00:02:10.270 
and then once your foot is in there the

00:02:10.270 --> 00:02:11.940 
and then once your foot is in there the
way<00:02:10.420> that<00:02:10.570> you'll<00:02:10.750> anchor<00:02:11.140> your<00:02:11.500> heel<00:02:11.770> in

00:02:11.940 --> 00:02:11.950 
way that you'll anchor your heel in

00:02:11.950 --> 00:02:14.310 
way that you'll anchor your heel in
place<00:02:11.980> is<00:02:12.520> to<00:02:12.940> take<00:02:13.180> it<00:02:13.480> come<00:02:13.720> across<00:02:14.020> through

00:02:14.310 --> 00:02:14.320 
place is to take it come across through

00:02:14.320 --> 00:02:18.210 
place is to take it come across through
the<00:02:14.380> opposite<00:02:14.950> loop<00:02:15.570> on<00:02:16.570> each<00:02:16.780> side<00:02:17.080> and<00:02:18.010> when

00:02:18.210 --> 00:02:18.220 
the opposite loop on each side and when

00:02:18.220 --> 00:02:21.840 
the opposite loop on each side and when
you<00:02:18.340> pull<00:02:18.640> it'll<00:02:19.120> actually<00:02:19.300> pull<00:02:20.130> in<00:02:21.130> so

00:02:21.840 --> 00:02:21.850 
you pull it'll actually pull in so

00:02:21.850 --> 00:02:22.980 
you pull it'll actually pull in so
imagine<00:02:22.150> there's<00:02:22.300> our<00:02:22.390> foot<00:02:22.570> in<00:02:22.660> there

00:02:22.980 --> 00:02:22.990 
imagine there's our foot in there

00:02:22.990 --> 00:02:25.320 
imagine there's our foot in there
it'll<00:02:23.410> pull<00:02:23.620> in<00:02:23.920> and<00:02:24.220> you<00:02:24.610> tie<00:02:24.790> your<00:02:24.940> shoe<00:02:25.150> like

00:02:25.320 --> 00:02:25.330 
it'll pull in and you tie your shoe like

00:02:25.330 --> 00:02:27.540 
it'll pull in and you tie your shoe like
normal<00:02:25.870> it<00:02:26.140> actually<00:02:26.290> anchors<00:02:26.950> your<00:02:27.130> heel<00:02:27.400> in

00:02:27.540 --> 00:02:27.550 
normal it actually anchors your heel in

00:02:27.550 --> 00:02:29.400 
normal it actually anchors your heel in
place<00:02:27.580> it<00:02:28.090> prevents<00:02:28.480> the<00:02:28.630> movement<00:02:29.080> forward

00:02:29.400 --> 00:02:29.410 
place it prevents the movement forward

00:02:29.410 --> 00:02:30.780 
place it prevents the movement forward
of<00:02:29.650> your<00:02:29.710> toes<00:02:30.010> and<00:02:30.040> you're<00:02:30.340> going<00:02:30.580> downhill

00:02:30.780 --> 00:02:30.790 
of your toes and you're going downhill

00:02:30.790 --> 00:02:32.310 
of your toes and you're going downhill
and<00:02:31.060> it'll<00:02:31.270> stop<00:02:31.480> the<00:02:31.510> friction<00:02:32.110> and<00:02:32.260> the

00:02:32.310 --> 00:02:32.320 
and it'll stop the friction and the

00:02:32.320 --> 00:02:33.900 
and it'll stop the friction and the
blistering<00:02:32.710> on<00:02:32.920> your<00:02:33.040> toes<00:02:33.250> it'll<00:02:33.700> prevent

blistering on your toes it'll prevent

00:02:33.910 --> 00:02:35.670 
blistering on your toes it'll prevent
you<00:02:34.030> losing<00:02:34.330> toenails<00:02:34.600> on<00:02:34.810> long<00:02:34.930> hikes<00:02:35.140> okay

00:02:35.670 --> 00:02:35.680 
you losing toenails on long hikes okay

00:02:35.680 --> 00:02:38.880 
you losing toenails on long hikes okay
that<00:02:36.310> is<00:02:36.430> good<00:02:36.610> to<00:02:36.730> do
