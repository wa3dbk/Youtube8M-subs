00:00:58.829 --> 00:01:00.740 
set 6 177 I believe it's bricks and more
and<00:00:59.100> that<00:00:59.640> gives<00:00:59.820> you<00:00:59.910> nine<00:01:00.120> different<00:01:00.420> colors

00:01:00.740 --> 00:01:00.750 
and that gives you nine different colors

00:01:00.750 --> 00:01:02.810 
and that gives you nine different colors
then<00:01:01.109> we<00:01:01.350> go<00:01:01.500> down<00:01:01.770> the<00:01:02.010> scale<00:01:02.250> from<00:01:02.579> white

00:01:02.810 --> 00:01:02.820 
then we go down the scale from white

00:01:02.820 --> 00:01:05.600 
then we go down the scale from white
through<00:01:03.660> yellow<00:01:03.989> orange<00:01:04.530> red<00:01:04.769> brown<00:01:05.309> and

to<00:01:08.369> fiddle<00:01:08.549> with<00:01:08.729> the<00:01:08.820> tolerance<00:01:09.030> a<00:01:09.390> little

00:01:09.620 --> 00:01:09.630 
to fiddle with the tolerance a little

00:01:09.630 --> 00:01:33.660 
to fiddle with the tolerance a little
bit<00:01:09.750> to<00:01:09.960> get<00:01:10.110> the<00:01:11.420> gradiation<00:01:12.420> that<00:01:12.720> you<00:01:12.810> need

00:01:33.660 --> 00:01:33.670 

00:01:33.670 --> 00:01:36.100 

you<00:01:34.670> do<00:01:34.790> have<00:01:34.940> to<00:01:35.090> color<00:01:35.270> the<00:01:35.420> background<00:01:35.630> as

00:01:36.100 --> 00:01:36.110 
you do have to color the background as

00:01:36.110 --> 00:01:37.840 
you do have to color the background as
well<00:01:36.140> so<00:01:36.619> that<00:01:36.770> it<00:01:36.860> doesn't<00:01:37.160> disappear<00:01:37.610> with

00:01:37.840 --> 00:01:37.850 
well so that it doesn't disappear with

00:01:37.850 --> 00:01:40.540 
well so that it doesn't disappear with
the<00:01:37.880> mosaic<00:01:38.710> you<00:01:39.710> can<00:01:39.860> always<00:01:39.950> retail<00:01:40.430> that

00:01:40.540 --> 00:01:40.550 
the mosaic you can always retail that

00:01:40.550 --> 00:01:42.070 
the mosaic you can always retail that
later<00:01:40.820> or<00:01:41.090> manually<00:01:41.540> once<00:01:41.720> you<00:01:41.840> have<00:01:41.990> your

the data on each of those pixels and you

00:01:51.220 --> 00:01:54.249 
the data on each of those pixels and you
then<00:01:52.220> need<00:01:52.250> to<00:01:52.430> open<00:01:52.790> a<00:01:52.850> simple<00:01:53.090> program<00:01:53.630> like

mosaic<00:02:40.180> using<00:02:40.659> the<00:02:40.750> 48<00:02:41.230> by<00:02:41.260> 48<00:02:41.440> plates<00:02:42.190> you'll

00:02:42.839 --> 00:02:42.849 
mosaic using the 48 by 48 plates you'll

00:02:42.849 --> 00:02:44.699 
mosaic using the 48 by 48 plates you'll
simply<00:02:43.060> need<00:02:43.209> to<00:02:43.390> do<00:02:43.629> a<00:02:43.840> larger<00:02:44.230> conversion

00:02:44.699 --> 00:02:44.709 
simply need to do a larger conversion

00:02:44.709 --> 00:02:57.040 
simply need to do a larger conversion
for<00:02:44.890> that

00:02:57.040 --> 00:02:57.050 

00:02:57.050 --> 00:03:00.170 

once<00:02:58.050> you've<00:02:58.200> saved<00:02:58.410> this<00:02:58.740> you<00:02:59.490> then<00:02:59.640> open<00:02:59.910> the

00:03:00.170 --> 00:03:00.180 
once you've saved this you then open the

00:03:00.180 --> 00:03:01.850 
once you've saved this you then open the
file<00:03:00.330> that<00:03:00.360> you<00:03:00.600> created<00:03:00.780> of<00:03:01.200> the<00:03:01.260> mosaic

00:03:01.850 --> 00:03:01.860 
file that you created of the mosaic

00:03:01.860 --> 00:03:27.700 
file that you created of the mosaic
image<00:03:02.040> from<00:03:02.880> paint.net

00:03:27.700 --> 00:03:27.710 

00:03:27.710 --> 00:03:29.780 

and<00:03:28.710> you're<00:03:28.860> actually<00:03:28.980> going<00:03:29.190> to<00:03:29.280> copy<00:03:29.490> this

00:03:29.780 --> 00:03:29.790 
and you're actually going to copy this

00:03:29.790 --> 00:03:31.700 
and you're actually going to copy this
if<00:03:30.450> you<00:03:30.630> simply<00:03:30.960> stretch<00:03:31.320> it<00:03:31.530> horizontally

00:03:31.700 --> 00:03:31.710 
if you simply stretch it horizontally

00:03:31.710 --> 00:03:34.820 
if you simply stretch it horizontally
and<00:03:32.400> vertically<00:03:33.380> you'll<00:03:34.380> see<00:03:34.560> that<00:03:34.680> the

00:03:34.820 --> 00:03:34.830 
and vertically you'll see that the

00:03:34.830 --> 00:03:36.890 
and vertically you'll see that the
program<00:03:35.040> will<00:03:35.310> adjust<00:03:35.760> the<00:03:35.940> image<00:03:36.270> through<00:03:36.810> a

00:03:36.890 --> 00:03:36.900 
program will adjust the image through a

00:03:36.900 --> 00:03:38.600 
program will adjust the image through a
gradient<00:03:37.170> or<00:03:37.560> it<00:03:37.680> will<00:03:37.800> dizzy<00:03:38.010> RIT<00:03:38.250> so<00:03:38.460> that

00:03:38.600 --> 00:03:38.610 
gradient or it will dizzy RIT so that

00:03:38.610 --> 00:03:40.160 
gradient or it will dizzy RIT so that
you<00:03:38.850> don't<00:03:39.030> see<00:03:39.300> the<00:03:39.450> interruptions<00:03:40.020> of<00:03:40.110> the

00:03:40.160 --> 00:03:40.170 
you don't see the interruptions of the

00:03:40.170 --> 00:03:41.960 
you don't see the interruptions of the
pixels<00:03:40.560> that's<00:03:40.890> not<00:03:41.190> what<00:03:41.370> you<00:03:41.520> want<00:03:41.700> in<00:03:41.880> this

00:03:41.960 --> 00:03:41.970 
pixels that's not what you want in this

00:03:41.970 --> 00:03:45.260 
pixels that's not what you want in this
case<00:03:43.310> you're<00:03:44.310> going<00:03:44.340> to<00:03:44.460> copy<00:03:44.670> the<00:03:44.880> picture

00:03:45.260 --> 00:03:45.270 
case you're going to copy the picture

00:03:45.270 --> 00:03:48.350 
case you're going to copy the picture
and<00:03:45.450> you'll<00:03:46.320> open<00:03:46.500> a<00:03:46.710> new<00:03:46.860> file<00:03:47.190> and<00:03:47.520> that<00:03:47.580> file

00:03:48.350 --> 00:03:48.360 
and you'll open a new file and that file

00:03:48.360 --> 00:03:50.510 
and you'll open a new file and that file
ought<00:03:48.630> to<00:03:48.870> be<00:03:48.960> that<00:03:49.140> same<00:03:49.380> proportion<00:03:49.980> four

00:03:50.510 --> 00:03:50.520 
ought to be that same proportion four

00:03:50.520 --> 00:03:53.090 
ought to be that same proportion four
times<00:03:50.790> larger<00:03:51.030> so<00:03:51.270> you'll<00:03:51.570> see<00:03:51.750> here<00:03:51.960> it's<00:03:52.110> 256

00:03:53.090 --> 00:03:53.100 
times larger so you'll see here it's 256

00:03:53.100 --> 00:03:56.870 
times larger so you'll see here it's 256
by<00:03:53.430> 384<00:03:54.240> now<00:03:54.600> and<00:03:55.310> you'll<00:03:56.310> paste<00:03:56.520> your<00:03:56.730> image

00:03:56.870 --> 00:03:56.880 
by 384 now and you'll paste your image

00:03:56.880 --> 00:03:59.270 
by 384 now and you'll paste your image
and<00:03:57.240> you'll<00:03:57.480> stretch<00:03:57.780> it<00:03:57.960> to<00:03:58.080> fit<00:03:58.110> and<00:03:58.620> you'll

00:03:59.270 --> 00:03:59.280 
and you'll stretch it to fit and you'll

00:03:59.280 --> 00:04:00.920 
and you'll stretch it to fit and you'll
see<00:03:59.430> you<00:03:59.550> maintain<00:03:59.970> the<00:04:00.090> pixelation<00:04:00.570> while

00:04:00.920 --> 00:04:00.930 
see you maintain the pixelation while

00:04:00.930 --> 00:04:03.080 
see you maintain the pixelation while
still<00:04:01.230> getting<00:04:01.500> a<00:04:01.560> larger<00:04:01.890> image<00:04:02.070> and<00:04:02.460> you

00:04:03.080 --> 00:04:03.090 
still getting a larger image and you

00:04:03.090 --> 00:04:04.610 
still getting a larger image and you
need<00:04:03.240> to<00:04:03.330> save<00:04:03.540> this<00:04:03.750> again<00:04:04.050> the<00:04:04.200> same<00:04:04.440> way<00:04:04.470> you

00:04:04.610 --> 00:04:04.620 
need to save this again the same way you

00:04:04.620 --> 00:04:13.070 
need to save this again the same way you
did<00:04:04.830> the<00:04:04.950> grid<00:04:05.220> in<00:04:05.400> a<00:04:05.910> bitmap<00:04:06.630> format<00:04:12.080> you're

00:04:13.070 --> 00:04:13.080 
did the grid in a bitmap format you're

00:04:13.080 --> 00:04:15.370 
did the grid in a bitmap format you're
then<00:04:13.290> going<00:04:13.440> to<00:04:13.500> open<00:04:13.830> paint.net<00:04:14.190> again<00:04:14.790> and

00:04:15.370 --> 00:04:15.380 
then going to open paint.net again and

00:04:15.380 --> 00:04:21.490 
then going to open paint.net again and
open<00:04:16.380> your<00:04:16.500> old<00:04:16.650> or<00:04:16.920> your<00:04:17.220> new<00:04:17.400> file

00:04:21.490 --> 00:04:21.500 

00:04:21.500 --> 00:04:27.629 

you

00:04:27.629 --> 00:04:27.639 

00:04:27.639 --> 00:04:29.460 

you

00:04:29.460 --> 00:04:29.470 
you

00:04:29.470 --> 00:04:31.170 
you
once<00:04:30.070> you've<00:04:30.190> opened<00:04:30.280> your<00:04:30.550> new<00:04:30.700> file<00:04:30.970> you

00:04:31.170 --> 00:04:31.180 
once you've opened your new file you

00:04:31.180 --> 00:04:33.300 
once you've opened your new file you
need<00:04:31.270> to<00:04:31.330> create<00:04:31.720> a<00:04:31.750> second<00:04:32.290> layer<00:04:32.470> which<00:04:33.220> are

00:04:33.300 --> 00:04:33.310 
need to create a second layer which are

00:04:33.310 --> 00:04:42.390 
need to create a second layer which are
going<00:04:33.460> to<00:04:33.520> use<00:04:33.730> for<00:04:33.970> the<00:04:34.030> grid<00:04:34.270> overlay

00:04:42.390 --> 00:04:42.400 

00:04:42.400 --> 00:04:45.879 

you

00:04:45.879 --> 00:04:45.889 

00:04:45.889 --> 00:04:47.980 

you<00:04:46.520> have<00:04:46.639> to<00:04:46.759> open<00:04:47.030> the<00:04:47.060> grid<00:04:47.300> overlay<00:04:47.719> and

00:04:47.980 --> 00:04:47.990 
you have to open the grid overlay and

00:04:47.990 --> 00:04:51.189 
you have to open the grid overlay and
then<00:04:48.620> you<00:04:48.740> use<00:04:48.949> a<00:04:49.330> shift-click<00:04:50.330> method<00:04:50.960> again

00:04:51.189 --> 00:04:51.199 
then you use a shift-click method again

00:04:51.199 --> 00:04:53.290 
then you use a shift-click method again
to<00:04:51.349> select<00:04:51.530> all<00:04:51.889> the<00:04:52.009> whitespace<00:04:52.370> and<00:04:52.759> you're

00:04:53.290 --> 00:04:53.300 
to select all the whitespace and you're

00:04:53.300 --> 00:04:54.459 
to select all the whitespace and you're
going<00:04:53.419> to<00:04:53.479> delete<00:04:53.780> that<00:04:53.840> so<00:04:54.229> it's<00:04:54.379> a

00:04:54.459 --> 00:04:54.469 
going to delete that so it's a

00:04:54.469 --> 00:05:04.260 
going to delete that so it's a
transparent<00:04:54.830> grid

00:05:04.260 --> 00:05:04.270 

00:05:04.270 --> 00:05:07.060 

now<00:05:05.270> you<00:05:05.330> select<00:05:05.780> the<00:05:06.230> grid<00:05:06.620> as<00:05:06.860> the

00:05:07.060 --> 00:05:07.070 
now you select the grid as the

00:05:07.070 --> 00:05:09.310 
now you select the grid as the
background<00:05:07.250> and<00:05:07.760> you<00:05:07.820> do<00:05:08.600> need<00:05:08.750> to<00:05:08.840> merge<00:05:09.050> the

00:05:09.310 --> 00:05:09.320 
background and you do need to merge the

00:05:09.320 --> 00:05:11.560 
background and you do need to merge the
two<00:05:09.350> layers<00:05:09.710> down<00:05:10.090> once<00:05:11.090> they're<00:05:11.300> glued

00:05:11.560 --> 00:05:11.570 
two layers down once they're glued

00:05:11.570 --> 00:05:14.409 
two layers down once they're glued
together<00:05:12.580> you'll<00:05:13.580> see<00:05:13.790> here<00:05:13.940> that's<00:05:14.090> the<00:05:14.240> next

00:05:14.409 --> 00:05:14.419 
together you'll see here that's the next

00:05:14.419 --> 00:05:23.050 
together you'll see here that's the next
step<00:05:19.090> you<00:05:20.090> then<00:05:20.300> can<00:05:20.480> control<00:05:20.930> X<00:05:21.169> to<00:05:21.620> cut<00:05:22.060> that

00:05:23.050 --> 00:05:23.060 
step you then can control X to cut that

00:05:23.060 --> 00:05:24.430 
step you then can control X to cut that
section<00:05:23.480> out<00:05:23.630> and<00:05:23.840> then<00:05:24.080> you<00:05:24.139> create<00:05:24.350> a<00:05:24.380> new

00:05:24.430 --> 00:05:24.440 
section out and then you create a new

00:05:24.440 --> 00:05:27.010 
section out and then you create a new
picture<00:05:24.770> you<00:05:25.220> paste<00:05:25.520> and<00:05:25.850> there<00:05:26.600> you<00:05:26.690> have<00:05:26.720> it

00:05:27.010 --> 00:05:27.020 
picture you paste and there you have it

00:05:27.020 --> 00:05:29.260 
picture you paste and there you have it
that's<00:05:27.139> one<00:05:27.500> full<00:05:27.860> grid<00:05:28.100> panel<00:05:28.340> you'll<00:05:29.060> see<00:05:29.240> I

00:05:29.260 --> 00:05:29.270 
that's one full grid panel you'll see I

00:05:29.270 --> 00:05:31.540 
that's one full grid panel you'll see I
need<00:05:29.540> to<00:05:29.630> fine-tune<00:05:29.900> some<00:05:30.169> of<00:05:30.560> those<00:05:30.710> to<00:05:31.430> get

00:05:31.540 --> 00:05:31.550 
need to fine-tune some of those to get

00:05:31.550 --> 00:05:33.250 
need to fine-tune some of those to get
all<00:05:31.700> the<00:05:31.790> colors<00:05:32.060> the<00:05:32.210> same<00:05:32.450> but<00:05:32.720> it's

00:05:33.250 --> 00:05:33.260 
all the colors the same but it's

00:05:33.260 --> 00:05:35.350 
all the colors the same but it's
serviceable<00:05:33.770> and<00:05:34.070> then<00:05:34.550> once<00:05:34.760> you<00:05:34.880> save<00:05:35.120> each

00:05:35.350 --> 00:05:35.360 
serviceable and then once you save each

00:05:35.360 --> 00:05:36.790 
serviceable and then once you save each
of<00:05:35.510> those<00:05:35.600> grid<00:05:35.840> patterns<00:05:36.200> together<00:05:36.560> you

00:05:36.790 --> 00:05:36.800 
of those grid patterns together you
