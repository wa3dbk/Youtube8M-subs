how<00:01:44.189> he's<00:01:44.549> aloof<00:01:44.970> I<00:01:45.329> thought<00:01:45.990> Ron<00:01:46.320> Rivera

00:01:46.870 --> 00:01:46.880 
how he's aloof I thought Ron Rivera

00:01:46.880 --> 00:01:49.160

should have been fired at the end of the

00:01:49.170 --> 00:01:51.170 
should have been fired at the end of the
year<00:01:49.200> I<00:01:49.619> thought<00:01:50.130> it<00:01:50.280> was<00:01:50.399> time<00:01:50.640> to<00:01:50.700> hire<00:01:51.149> a

00:01:51.170 --> 00:01:51.180 
year I thought it was time to hire a

00:01:51.180 --> 00:01:54.020 
year I thought it was time to hire a
young<00:01:51.770> innovative<00:01:52.770> offense<00:01:53.040> of<00:01:53.490> mind<00:01:53.759> like<00:01:54.000> a

00:01:54.020 --> 00:01:54.030 
young innovative offense of mind like a

00:01:54.030 --> 00:01:57.080 
young innovative offense of mind like a
Mike<00:01:54.329> McCoy<00:01:54.780> or<00:01:55.200> a<00:01:55.259> Jay<00:01:55.799> Gruden<00:01:56.369> I<00:01:56.549> think

00:01:57.080 --> 00:01:57.090 
Mike McCoy or a Jay Gruden I think

00:01:57.090 --> 00:01:58.910 
Mike McCoy or a Jay Gruden I think
that's<00:01:57.270> the<00:01:57.450> only<00:01:57.719> chance<00:01:58.049> that<00:01:58.229> Caroline<00:01:58.890> is

00:01:58.910 --> 00:01:58.920 
that's the only chance that Caroline is

00:01:58.920 --> 00:02:02.090 
that's the only chance that Caroline is
gonna<00:01:59.130> have<00:01:59.460> to<00:01:59.729> maximize<00:01:59.939> Cam<00:02:00.600> Newton<00:02:01.100> okay

00:02:02.090 --> 00:02:02.100 
gonna have to maximize Cam Newton okay

00:02:02.100 --> 00:02:03.740 
gonna have to maximize Cam Newton okay

for<00:02:23.640> success<00:02:24.740> well<00:02:25.740> Scott<00:02:26.010> I<00:02:26.040> think<00:02:26.340> it's<00:02:26.520> a

00:02:26.660 --> 00:02:26.670 
for success well Scott I think it's a

00:02:26.670 --> 00:02:28.970 
for success well Scott I think it's a
great<00:02:26.880> set<00:02:27.300> of<00:02:27.330> questions<00:02:27.600> and<00:02:28.170> let's<00:02:28.530> go<00:02:28.710> one

00:02:28.970 --> 00:02:28.980 
great set of questions and let's go one

00:02:28.980 --> 00:02:31.520 
great set of questions and let's go one
by<00:02:29.130> one<00:02:29.160> number<00:02:29.700> one<00:02:29.880> I<00:02:30.480> think<00:02:30.990> cam<00:02:31.170> newton

00:02:31.520 --> 00:02:31.530 
by one number one I think cam newton

00:02:31.530 --> 00:02:33.680 
by one number one I think cam newton
needs<00:02:31.680> to<00:02:31.800> be<00:02:31.950> a<00:02:31.980> better<00:02:32.250> leader<00:02:32.610> I<00:02:32.880> think<00:02:33.450> that

00:02:33.680 --> 00:02:33.690 
needs to be a better leader I think that

00:02:33.690 --> 00:02:36.770 
needs to be a better leader I think that
you<00:02:34.200> know<00:02:34.350> you<00:02:34.650> look<00:02:34.890> at<00:02:35.100> cam<00:02:35.370> newton<00:02:35.850> and<00:02:36.150> how

00:02:36.770 --> 00:02:36.780 
you know you look at cam newton and how

00:02:36.780 --> 00:02:38.960 
you know you look at cam newton and how
he<00:02:36.840> celebrates<00:02:37.530> on<00:02:37.710> the<00:02:37.800> NFL<00:02:38.160> network<00:02:38.610> in<00:02:38.820> that

00:02:38.960 --> 00:02:38.970 
he celebrates on the NFL network in that

00:02:38.970 --> 00:02:41.240 
he celebrates on the NFL network in that
game<00:02:39.180> against<00:02:39.510> the<00:02:39.690> giants<00:02:39.720> last<00:02:40.350> year<00:02:40.860> you

00:02:41.240 --> 00:02:41.250 
game against the giants last year you

00:02:41.250 --> 00:02:42.350 
game against the giants last year you
know<00:02:41.280> when<00:02:41.520> they're<00:02:41.640> down<00:02:41.820> big<00:02:42.090> on<00:02:42.240> the

00:02:42.350 --> 00:02:42.360 
know when they're down big on the

00:02:42.360 --> 00:02:45.320 
know when they're down big on the
scoreboard<00:02:43.020> enough<00:02:43.740> the<00:02:44.010> suggestion<00:02:44.790> box<00:02:44.820> in

the press conference or not sometimes I

00:02:47.820 --> 00:02:49.910 
the press conference or not sometimes I
think<00:02:48.000> it's<00:02:48.090> okay<00:02:48.480> for<00:02:48.840> young<00:02:49.350> quarterbacks

00:02:49.910 --> 00:02:49.920 
think it's okay for young quarterbacks

00:02:49.920 --> 00:02:51.620 
think it's okay for young quarterbacks
when<00:02:50.130> they're<00:02:50.280> trying<00:02:50.520> to<00:02:50.610> master<00:02:51.210> the<00:02:51.360> fifth

00:02:51.620 --> 00:02:51.630 
when they're trying to master the fifth

00:02:51.630 --> 00:02:53.600 
when they're trying to master the fifth
quarter<00:02:51.930> of<00:02:52.110> being<00:02:52.320> a<00:02:52.410> quarterback<00:02:52.650> to<00:02:53.430> ask

00:02:53.600 --> 00:02:53.610 
quarter of being a quarterback to ask

00:02:53.610 --> 00:02:55.880 
quarter of being a quarterback to ask
themselves<00:02:54.120> what<00:02:54.840> would<00:02:55.050> paint<00:02:55.350> and<00:02:55.530> Manning

00:02:55.880 --> 00:02:55.890 
themselves what would paint and Manning

00:02:55.890 --> 00:02:58.250 
themselves what would paint and Manning
to<00:02:56.040> what<00:02:56.280> would<00:02:56.430> Tom<00:02:56.700> Brady<00:02:57.030> do<00:02:57.360> what<00:02:58.110> would

00:02:58.250 --> 00:02:58.260 
to what would Tom Brady do what would

00:02:58.260 --> 00:02:59.450 
to what would Tom Brady do what would
even<00:02:58.620> some<00:02:58.800> of<00:02:58.830> these<00:02:58.950> other<00:02:59.190> young
