00:00:29.630 --> 00:00:29.640 
I'm not really going to explain too much

00:00:29.640 --> 00:00:30.950 
I'm not really going to explain too much
about<00:00:29.970> the<00:00:30.090> teams<00:00:30.269> because<00:00:30.449> they're<00:00:30.750> pretty

00:00:30.950 --> 00:00:30.960 
about the teams because they're pretty

00:00:30.960 --> 00:00:33.530 
about the teams because they're pretty
self-explanatory<00:00:31.969> so<00:00:32.969> we're<00:00:33.149> just<00:00:33.180> gonna<00:00:33.329> get

00:00:33.530 --> 00:00:33.540 
self-explanatory so we're just gonna get

00:00:33.540 --> 00:00:35.299 
self-explanatory so we're just gonna get
right<00:00:33.750> into<00:00:33.960> this<00:00:34.170> and<00:00:34.440> this<00:00:34.530> ends<00:00:34.890> up<00:00:34.950> being<00:00:35.010> a

00:00:35.299 --> 00:00:35.309 
right into this and this ends up being a

00:00:35.309 --> 00:00:39.770 
right into this and this ends up being a
very<00:00:35.640> short<00:00:36.059> match<00:00:36.980> so<00:00:37.980> yeah<00:00:38.370> that's<00:00:38.730> that<00:00:38.879> in

00:00:39.770 --> 00:00:39.780 
very short match so yeah that's that in

00:00:39.780 --> 00:00:41.540 
very short match so yeah that's that in
comes<00:00:40.140> the<00:00:40.260> hydreigon<00:00:40.710> to<00:00:41.010> lead<00:00:41.190> off<00:00:41.340> I'm

00:00:41.540 --> 00:00:41.550 
comes the hydreigon to lead off I'm

00:00:41.550 --> 00:00:44.690 
comes the hydreigon to lead off I'm
gonna<00:00:41.640> lead<00:00:41.910> off<00:00:41.940> with<00:00:42.210> my<00:00:42.390> politoed<00:00:43.260> and<00:00:43.700> I

00:00:44.690 --> 00:00:44.700 
gonna lead off with my politoed and I

00:00:44.700 --> 00:00:46.520 
gonna lead off with my politoed and I
try<00:00:45.000> to<00:00:45.030> not<00:00:45.450> lead<00:00:45.690> off<00:00:45.809> with<00:00:45.960> pollito<00:00:46.320> too

try to not lead off with pollito too

00:00:46.530 --> 00:00:47.959 
try to not lead off with pollito too
much<00:00:46.680> because<00:00:46.980> it's<00:00:47.129> pretty<00:00:47.250> predictable<00:00:47.550> but

00:00:47.959 --> 00:00:47.969 
much because it's pretty predictable but

00:00:47.969 --> 00:00:49.549 
much because it's pretty predictable but
I<00:00:48.000> was<00:00:48.180> like<00:00:48.360> you<00:00:48.539> know<00:00:48.660> I<00:00:49.289> I'm<00:00:49.410> gonna

I was like you know I I'm gonna

00:00:49.559 --> 00:00:50.209 
I was like you know I I'm gonna
do<00:00:49.710> it<00:00:49.829> this<00:00:49.920> time

00:00:50.209 --> 00:00:50.219 
do it this time

00:00:50.219 --> 00:00:52.819 
do it this time
so<00:00:51.120> yeah<00:00:51.570> the<00:00:51.750> rain<00:00:51.930> starts<00:00:52.500> to<00:00:52.590> get<00:00:52.739> the

00:00:52.819 --> 00:00:52.829 
so yeah the rain starts to get the

00:00:52.829 --> 00:00:54.619 
so yeah the rain starts to get the
drizzle<00:00:53.190> up<00:00:53.309> all<00:00:53.550> that<00:00:53.760> good<00:00:54.030> stuff<00:00:54.239> but<00:00:54.510> I'm

00:00:54.619 --> 00:00:54.629 
drizzle up all that good stuff but I'm

00:00:54.629 --> 00:00:56.090 
drizzle up all that good stuff but I'm
gonna<00:00:54.809> switch<00:00:55.050> out<00:00:55.230> here<00:00:55.440> because<00:00:55.620> I'd<00:00:55.860> like

00:00:56.090 --> 00:00:56.100 
gonna switch out here because I'd like

00:00:56.100 --> 00:00:58.910 
gonna switch out here because I'd like
to<00:00:56.309> preserve<00:00:56.989> have<00:00:57.989> politoed<00:00:58.469> as<00:00:58.620> long<00:00:58.770> as

00:00:58.910 --> 00:00:58.920 
to preserve have politoed as long as

00:00:58.920 --> 00:01:00.439 
to preserve have politoed as long as
possible<00:00:59.070> because<00:00:59.460> I<00:00:59.670> do<00:00:59.730> not<00:00:59.969> have<00:01:00.149> another

00:01:00.439 --> 00:01:00.449 
possible because I do not have another

00:01:00.449 --> 00:01:04.070 
possible because I do not have another
rain<00:01:00.719> inducer<00:01:01.170> so<00:01:02.000> in<00:01:03.000> comes<00:01:03.270> Ferrothorn<00:01:03.840> to

00:01:04.070 --> 00:01:04.080 
rain inducer so in comes Ferrothorn to

00:01:04.080 --> 00:01:05.870 
rain inducer so in comes Ferrothorn to
take<00:01:04.290> a<00:01:04.500> dragon-type<00:01:05.100> attack<00:01:05.489> but<00:01:05.640> it<00:01:05.700> turns

00:01:05.870 --> 00:01:05.880 
take a dragon-type attack but it turns

00:01:05.880 --> 00:01:08.030 
take a dragon-type attack but it turns
out<00:01:05.970> he's<00:01:06.150> gonna<00:01:06.210> go<00:01:06.450> for<00:01:06.630> the<00:01:06.750> try<00:01:07.020> attack<00:01:07.409> and

00:01:08.030 --> 00:01:08.040 
out he's gonna go for the try attack and

00:01:08.040 --> 00:01:09.920 
out he's gonna go for the try attack and
that's<00:01:08.460> kind<00:01:08.729> of<00:01:08.820> strange<00:01:09.119> but<00:01:09.420> he<00:01:09.570> also<00:01:09.720> has

00:01:09.920 --> 00:01:09.930 
that's kind of strange but he also has

00:01:09.930 --> 00:01:12.740 
that's kind of strange but he also has
the<00:01:10.080> flamethrower<00:01:10.680> and<00:01:11.090> the<00:01:12.090> rain<00:01:12.299> helps<00:01:12.630> me

00:01:12.740 --> 00:01:12.750 
the flamethrower and the rain helps me

00:01:12.750 --> 00:01:14.090 
the flamethrower and the rain helps me
out<00:01:12.900> there<00:01:13.170> that's<00:01:13.409> basically<00:01:13.710> the<00:01:13.860> only

00:01:14.090 --> 00:01:14.100 
out there that's basically the only

00:01:14.100 --> 00:01:15.740 
out there that's basically the only
reason<00:01:14.369> that<00:01:14.400> I<00:01:14.520> survived<00:01:14.970> and<00:01:15.330> I'm<00:01:15.420> able<00:01:15.570> to

00:01:15.740 --> 00:01:15.750 
reason that I survived and I'm able to

00:01:15.750 --> 00:01:17.810 
reason that I survived and I'm able to
get<00:01:15.930> off<00:01:16.140> a<00:01:16.380> stealth<00:01:16.799> frog<00:01:17.070> I<00:01:17.250> contemplated

00:01:17.810 --> 00:01:17.820 
get off a stealth frog I contemplated

00:01:17.820 --> 00:01:19.999 
get off a stealth frog I contemplated
going<00:01:17.939> for<00:01:18.270> leech<00:01:18.570> seed<00:01:18.810> there<00:01:19.110> thinking<00:01:19.920> you

00:01:19.999 --> 00:01:20.009 
going for leech seed there thinking you

00:01:20.009 --> 00:01:22.190 
going for leech seed there thinking you
might<00:01:20.220> switch<00:01:20.700> on<00:01:21.420> off<00:01:21.750> chance<00:01:22.020> that<00:01:22.140> he

00:01:22.190 --> 00:01:22.200 
might switch on off chance that he

00:01:22.200 --> 00:01:24.140 
might switch on off chance that he
doesn't<00:01:22.470> have<00:01:22.530> a<00:01:22.590> fire<00:01:22.860> attack<00:01:23.009> but<00:01:23.549> yeah

00:01:24.140 --> 00:01:24.150 
doesn't have a fire attack but yeah

00:01:24.150 --> 00:01:25.670 
doesn't have a fire attack but yeah
thankfully<00:01:24.810> I<00:01:24.840> went<00:01:25.049> for<00:01:25.229> these<00:01:25.409> stealth

00:01:25.670 --> 00:01:25.680 
thankfully I went for these stealth

00:01:25.680 --> 00:01:27.170 
thankfully I went for these stealth
rocks<00:01:25.950> because<00:01:26.310> it<00:01:26.430> ends<00:01:26.640> up<00:01:26.670> helping<00:01:27.000> me<00:01:27.150> out

00:01:27.170 --> 00:01:27.180

00:01:39.590 --> 00:01:39.600 
Swift swim and dragon pulse I think I

00:01:39.600 --> 00:01:41.090 
Swift swim and dragon pulse I think I
might<00:01:39.780> be<00:01:39.900> able<00:01:39.960> to<00:01:40.079> sweep<00:01:40.320> his<00:01:40.470> entire<00:01:40.799> team

00:01:41.090 --> 00:01:41.100 
might be able to sweep his entire team

00:01:41.100 --> 00:01:43.100 
might be able to sweep his entire team
or<00:01:41.310> pretty<00:01:41.520> close<00:01:41.579> to<00:01:41.759> it<00:01:42.060> so<00:01:42.270> I'm<00:01:42.570> going<00:01:42.780> to<00:01:42.960> go

00:01:43.100 --> 00:01:43.110 
or pretty close to it so I'm going to go

00:01:43.110 --> 00:01:45.050 
or pretty close to it so I'm going to go
for<00:01:43.290> the<00:01:43.380> dragon<00:01:43.740> pulse<00:01:43.890> lock<00:01:44.250> myself<00:01:44.460> into<00:01:44.850> it

00:01:45.050 --> 00:01:45.060 
for the dragon pulse lock myself into it

00:01:45.060 --> 00:01:47.690 
for the dragon pulse lock myself into it
because<00:01:45.240> I<00:01:45.390> am<00:01:45.750> a<00:01:45.780> choice<00:01:46.229> spec<00:01:46.560> set<00:01:46.890> that

00:01:47.690 --> 00:01:47.700 
because I am a choice spec set that

00:01:47.700 --> 00:01:50.600 
because I am a choice spec set that
takes<00:01:48.030> out<00:01:48.210> hydreigon<00:01:48.600> in<00:01:48.810> one<00:01:49.020> hit<00:01:49.259> in<00:01:50.159> comes

00:01:50.600 --> 00:01:50.610 
takes out hydreigon in one hit in comes

00:01:50.610 --> 00:01:52.819 
takes out hydreigon in one hit in comes
the<00:01:51.090> Kingdra<00:01:51.509> and<00:01:51.720> looking<00:01:52.229> at<00:01:52.350> his<00:01:52.439> team<00:01:52.649> this

00:01:52.819 --> 00:01:52.829 
the Kingdra and looking at his team this

00:01:52.829 --> 00:01:54.260 
the Kingdra and looking at his team this
is<00:01:53.009> the<00:01:53.130> only<00:01:53.310> thing<00:01:53.610> that<00:01:53.759> I'm<00:01:53.820> really<00:01:53.970> afraid

00:01:54.260 --> 00:01:54.270 
is the only thing that I'm really afraid

00:01:54.270 --> 00:01:56.690 
is the only thing that I'm really afraid
of<00:01:54.680> this<00:01:55.680> is<00:01:55.829> the<00:01:55.920> only<00:01:56.189> thing<00:01:56.399> that<00:01:56.579> I<00:01:56.610> think

00:01:56.690 --> 00:01:56.700 
of this is the only thing that I think

00:01:56.700 --> 00:02:00.920 
of this is the only thing that I think
can<00:01:57.090> stop<00:01:57.479> the<00:01:57.719> sweep<00:01:58.020> but<00:01:59.090> yeah<00:02:00.090> it<00:02:00.420> turns<00:02:00.750> out

00:02:00.920 --> 00:02:00.930 
can stop the sweep but yeah it turns out

00:02:00.930 --> 00:02:03.200 
can stop the sweep but yeah it turns out
that<00:02:01.259> I<00:02:01.290> either<00:02:01.560> just<00:02:01.979> win<00:02:02.250> the<00:02:02.399> speed<00:02:02.700> tie<00:02:02.909> or

00:02:03.200 --> 00:02:03.210 
that I either just win the speed tie or

00:02:03.210 --> 00:02:06.490 
that I either just win the speed tie or
he's<00:02:03.509> not<00:02:03.750> running<00:02:04.170> a<00:02:04.469> positive<00:02:05.159> speed

00:02:06.490 --> 00:02:06.500 
he's not running a positive speed

00:02:06.500 --> 00:02:09.410 
he's not running a positive speed
natured<00:02:07.500> Kingdra<00:02:08.099> I<00:02:08.340> guess<00:02:08.910> either<00:02:09.179> are

00:02:09.410 --> 00:02:09.420 
natured Kingdra I guess either are

00:02:09.420 --> 00:02:10.490 
natured Kingdra I guess either are
possible

00:02:10.490 --> 00:02:10.500 
possible

00:02:10.500 --> 00:02:13.940 
possible
so<00:02:11.009> the<00:02:11.160> Kingdra<00:02:11.459> goes<00:02:11.640> down<00:02:11.940> and<00:02:12.590> incomes

00:02:13.940 --> 00:02:13.950 
so the Kingdra goes down and incomes

00:02:13.950 --> 00:02:16.309 
so the Kingdra goes down and incomes
Dragonite<00:02:14.879> his<00:02:15.150> multiscale<00:02:15.900> is<00:02:16.050> gonna<00:02:16.170> be

obviously<00:03:50.010> at<00:03:50.130> this<00:03:50.340> point<00:03:50.489> because<00:03:51.090> it's

00:03:51.289 --> 00:03:51.299 
obviously at this point because it's

00:03:51.299 --> 00:03:54.199
