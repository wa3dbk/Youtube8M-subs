have inside the minds of the world's

00:00:51.059 --> 00:00:54.319 
have inside the minds of the world's
most<00:00:51.180> prolific<00:00:51.680> scorers<00:00:52.680> you<00:00:53.579> also<00:00:53.850> have<00:00:54.059> the

00:00:54.319 --> 00:00:54.329 
most prolific scorers you also have the

00:00:54.329 --> 00:00:55.790 
most prolific scorers you also have the
one-on-one<00:00:54.930> vault<00:00:55.199> which<00:00:55.379> will<00:00:55.500> teach<00:00:55.680> you

00:00:55.790 --> 00:00:55.800 
one-on-one vault which will teach you

00:00:55.800 --> 00:00:58.279 
one-on-one vault which will teach you
some<00:00:55.949> great<00:00:56.129> one-on-one<00:00:56.489> moves<00:00:57.059> to<00:00:57.300> use<00:00:57.390> you

00:00:58.279 --> 00:00:58.289 
some great one-on-one moves to use you

00:00:58.289 --> 00:01:01.340 
some great one-on-one moves to use you
also<00:00:58.530> have<00:00:58.710> scoring<00:00:59.250> without<00:00:59.430> the<00:00:59.910> ball<00:01:00.350> which

00:01:01.340 --> 00:01:01.350 
also have scoring without the ball which

00:01:01.350 --> 00:01:02.869 
also have scoring without the ball which
is<00:01:01.530> something<00:01:01.710> I<00:01:01.890> see<00:01:02.070> so<00:01:02.340> many<00:01:02.460> courses

00:01:02.869 --> 00:01:02.879 
is something I see so many courses

00:01:02.879 --> 00:01:05.570 
is something I see so many courses
Passover<00:01:03.600> and<00:01:04.409> scoring<00:01:04.860> without<00:01:04.979> the<00:01:05.280> ball<00:01:05.460> is

00:01:05.570 --> 00:01:05.580 
Passover and scoring without the ball is

00:01:05.580 --> 00:01:07.940 
Passover and scoring without the ball is
probably<00:01:05.850> one<00:01:05.970> of<00:01:06.000> the<00:01:06.210> number<00:01:06.990> one<00:01:07.020> ways<00:01:07.650> you

00:01:07.940 --> 00:01:07.950 
probably one of the number one ways you

00:01:07.950 --> 00:01:09.710 
probably one of the number one ways you
can<00:01:08.100> score<00:01:08.369> more<00:01:08.549> points<00:01:08.610> in<00:01:09.090> my<00:01:09.210> opinion<00:01:09.510> and

00:01:09.710 --> 00:01:09.720 
can score more points in my opinion and

00:01:09.720 --> 00:01:11.539 
can score more points in my opinion and
it's<00:01:09.810> something<00:01:09.960> that<00:01:10.080> tons<00:01:11.010> of<00:01:11.130> people<00:01:11.250> just

00:01:11.539 --> 00:01:11.549 
it's something that tons of people just

00:01:11.549 --> 00:01:13.850 
it's something that tons of people just
never<00:01:11.670> look<00:01:12.030> at<00:01:12.240> you<00:01:12.600> know<00:01:12.990> what<00:01:13.170> you're<00:01:13.350> doing

00:01:13.850 --> 00:01:13.860 
never look at you know what you're doing

00:01:13.860 --> 00:01:15.499 
never look at you know what you're doing
when<00:01:14.400> you<00:01:14.520> don't<00:01:14.729> have<00:01:14.939> the<00:01:15.150> ball<00:01:15.299> in<00:01:15.330> your

00:01:15.499 --> 00:01:15.509 
when you don't have the ball in your

00:01:15.509 --> 00:01:17.330 
when you don't have the ball in your
hands<00:01:15.780> as<00:01:15.960> almost<00:01:16.259> even<00:01:16.590> more<00:01:16.799> important<00:01:17.250> than

00:01:17.330 --> 00:01:17.340 
hands as almost even more important than

00:01:17.340 --> 00:01:19.580 
hands as almost even more important than
what<00:01:17.520> you<00:01:17.640> do<00:01:17.820> when<00:01:18.720> you<00:01:18.840> have<00:01:19.080> the<00:01:19.290> ball<00:01:19.470> in

00:01:19.580 --> 00:01:19.590 
what you do when you have the ball in

00:01:19.590 --> 00:01:22.070 
what you do when you have the ball in
your<00:01:19.650> hands<00:01:20.040> we<00:01:20.640> also<00:01:20.790> have<00:01:20.990> mastering<00:01:21.990> the

00:01:22.070 --> 00:01:22.080 
your hands we also have mastering the

00:01:22.080 --> 00:01:25.520 
your hands we also have mastering the

00:01:25.520 --> 00:01:25.530 
mid game or the mid-range game which it

00:01:25.530 --> 00:01:27.170 
mid game or the mid-range game which it
really<00:01:25.740> doesn't<00:01:26.009> matter<00:01:26.580> too<00:01:26.850> much<00:01:26.880> what

00:01:27.170 --> 00:01:27.180 
really doesn't matter too much what

00:01:27.180 --> 00:01:28.999 
really doesn't matter too much what
position<00:01:27.570> you<00:01:27.689> play<00:01:27.720> you<00:01:27.960> still<00:01:28.350> need<00:01:28.590> a<00:01:28.619> great

00:01:28.999 --> 00:01:29.009 
position you play you still need a great

00:01:29.009 --> 00:01:31.640 
position you play you still need a great
mid-range<00:01:29.400> jumper<00:01:30.240> even<00:01:31.110> if<00:01:31.200> you're<00:01:31.320> a<00:01:31.350> big

invaluable on any type of team if you

00:01:38.460 --> 00:01:40.520 
invaluable on any type of team if you
look<00:01:38.579> at<00:01:38.729> the<00:01:38.909> the<00:01:39.150> NBA<00:01:39.810> it's<00:01:40.079> really<00:01:40.290> the<00:01:40.380> only

00:01:40.520 --> 00:01:40.530 
look at the the NBA it's really the only

00:01:40.530 --> 00:01:43.700 
look at the the NBA it's really the only
reason<00:01:41.070> a<00:01:41.130> guy<00:01:41.310> like<00:01:41.899> the<00:01:42.899> Girona<00:01:43.259> so<00:01:43.439> gauss

00:01:43.700 --> 00:01:43.710 
reason a guy like the Girona so gauss

00:01:43.710 --> 00:01:45.230 
reason a guy like the Girona so gauss
guess<00:01:43.979> is<00:01:44.220> still<00:01:44.430> playing<00:01:44.700> because<00:01:45.090> he

00:01:45.230 --> 00:01:45.240 
guess is still playing because he

00:01:45.240 --> 00:01:47.330
