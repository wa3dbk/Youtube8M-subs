00:03:26.949 --> 00:03:26.959 
so just help garnish it and add a little

00:03:26.959 --> 00:03:28.630 
so just help garnish it and add a little
bit<00:03:27.049> more<00:03:27.140> flavor<00:03:27.530> so<00:03:27.650> later<00:03:28.040> can<00:03:28.280> put<00:03:28.400> that<00:03:28.489> in

00:03:28.630 --> 00:03:28.640 
bit more flavor so later can put that in

00:03:28.640 --> 00:03:29.229 
bit more flavor so later can put that in
later

00:03:29.229 --> 00:03:29.239 
later

00:03:29.239 --> 00:03:33.100 
later
what's<00:03:30.110> you<00:03:30.489> going<00:03:31.489> to<00:03:31.610> put<00:03:31.819> in<00:03:32.030> some<00:03:32.480> chicken

00:03:33.100 --> 00:03:33.110 
what's you going to put in some chicken

00:03:33.110 --> 00:03:34.330 
what's you going to put in some chicken
too<00:03:33.290> just<00:03:33.709> so<00:03:33.739> there's<00:03:33.980> a<00:03:34.040> little<00:03:34.190> bit<00:03:34.280> of

00:03:34.330 --> 00:03:34.340 
too just so there's a little bit of

00:03:34.340 --> 00:03:35.949 
too just so there's a little bit of
protein<00:03:34.579> in<00:03:34.910> there<00:03:35.060> and<00:03:35.329> it's<00:03:35.510> easy<00:03:35.720> to<00:03:35.900> eat

00:03:35.949 --> 00:03:35.959 
protein in there and it's easy to eat

00:03:35.959 --> 00:03:39.160 
protein in there and it's easy to eat
and<00:03:36.549> I<00:03:37.549> think<00:03:37.940> that's<00:03:38.180> it<00:03:38.450> I<00:03:38.690> just<00:03:38.750> wanted<00:03:38.930> to

00:03:39.160 --> 00:03:39.170 
and I think that's it I just wanted to

00:03:39.170 --> 00:03:40.990 
and I think that's it I just wanted to
show<00:03:39.349> you<00:03:39.380> it's<00:03:39.980> still<00:03:40.340> simmering<00:03:40.579> it's<00:03:40.880> gonna

00:03:40.990 --> 00:03:41.000 
show you it's still simmering it's gonna

00:03:41.000 --> 00:03:42.309 
show you it's still simmering it's gonna
be<00:03:41.150> for<00:03:41.360> a<00:03:41.420> while<00:03:41.599> um

00:03:42.309 --> 00:03:42.319 
be for a while um

00:03:42.319 --> 00:03:44.979 
be for a while um
the<00:03:42.650> heat<00:03:42.920> is<00:03:43.160> just<00:03:43.190> on<00:03:43.609> like<00:03:44.120> low<00:03:44.480> medium

00:03:44.979 --> 00:03:44.989 
the heat is just on like low medium

00:03:44.989 --> 00:03:49.870 
the heat is just on like low medium
medium<00:03:45.440> low<00:03:45.590> and<00:03:47.170> even<00:03:48.170> though<00:03:48.400> did<00:03:49.400> start<00:03:49.730> off

00:03:49.870 --> 00:03:49.880 
medium low and even though did start off

00:03:49.880 --> 00:03:52.150 
medium low and even though did start off
with<00:03:50.000> a<00:03:50.090> look<00:03:50.239> like<00:03:50.480> much<00:03:50.690> rice<00:03:51.019> you<00:03:51.620> can<00:03:51.799> see

00:03:52.150 --> 00:03:52.160 
with a look like much rice you can see

00:03:52.160 --> 00:03:55.030 
with a look like much rice you can see
it<00:03:52.340> expanding<00:03:53.329> in<00:03:53.930> Vietnamese<00:03:54.350> I<00:03:54.500> think<00:03:54.739> it's

00:03:55.030 --> 00:03:55.040 
it expanding in Vietnamese I think it's

00:03:55.040 --> 00:03:58.270 
it expanding in Vietnamese I think it's
called<00:03:55.280> like<00:03:55.430> nah<00:03:56.000> this<00:03:56.450> is<00:03:56.660> the<00:03:56.690> rice<00:03:57.280> expands

00:03:58.270 --> 00:03:58.280 
called like nah this is the rice expands

00:03:58.280 --> 00:04:00.729 
called like nah this is the rice expands
and<00:03:58.760> so<00:03:58.970> you're<00:03:59.480> not<00:03:59.660> gonna<00:03:59.840> need<00:04:00.079> as<00:04:00.350> much

00:04:00.729 --> 00:04:00.739 
and so you're not gonna need as much

00:04:00.739 --> 00:04:02.890 
and so you're not gonna need as much
grain<00:04:01.100> of<00:04:01.250> rice<00:04:01.280> or<00:04:01.760> precooked<00:04:02.480> rice<00:04:02.540> as<00:04:02.870> you

00:04:02.890 --> 00:04:02.900 
grain of rice or precooked rice as you

00:04:02.900 --> 00:04:04.770 
grain of rice or precooked rice as you
would<00:04:03.170> think<00:04:03.410> like<00:04:03.650> it's<00:04:03.889> gonna<00:04:04.040> make<00:04:04.130> a<00:04:04.459> lot
