00:01:10.890 --> 00:01:13.100 
contradicts my viewpoint and I start to
wonder<00:01:10.920> was<00:01:11.490> I<00:01:11.820> right<00:01:12.210> with<00:01:12.390> my<00:01:12.540> assumption<00:01:12.990> I

00:01:41.060 --> 00:01:41.070 
one-shot kill for the upper chest shot I

00:01:41.070 --> 00:01:43.670 
one-shot kill for the upper chest shot I
was<00:01:41.310> running<00:01:41.579> around<00:01:41.670> with<00:01:42.479> the<00:01:42.810> l96

00:01:43.670 --> 00:01:43.680 
was running around with the l96

00:01:43.680 --> 00:01:45.830 
was running around with the l96
trying<00:01:43.950> to<00:01:44.040> get<00:01:44.159> headshots<00:01:44.640> up<00:01:44.880> close<00:01:45.119> and<00:01:45.360> it

00:01:45.830 --> 00:01:45.840 
trying to get headshots up close and it

00:01:45.840 --> 00:01:48.230 
trying to get headshots up close and it
was<00:01:45.869> extremely<00:01:46.530> exciting<00:01:47.399> but<00:01:47.520> also<00:01:47.549> just

00:01:48.230 --> 00:01:48.240 
was extremely exciting but also just

00:01:48.240 --> 00:01:50.840 
was extremely exciting but also just
very<00:01:48.530> frustrating<00:01:49.530> and<00:01:49.710> nerve-wracking<00:01:50.610> I

00:01:50.840 --> 00:01:50.850 
very frustrating and nerve-wracking I

00:01:50.850 --> 00:01:52.580 
very frustrating and nerve-wracking I
would<00:01:51.180> try<00:01:51.329> to<00:01:51.360> get<00:01:51.540> gameplay<00:01:52.049> I<00:01:52.079> try<00:01:52.380> to<00:01:52.439> get

00:01:52.580 --> 00:01:52.590 
would try to get gameplay I try to get

00:01:52.590 --> 00:01:54.800 
would try to get gameplay I try to get
footage<00:01:52.860> of<00:01:53.100> me<00:01:53.280> running<00:01:53.460> around<00:01:53.670> with<00:01:54.210> you

00:01:54.800 --> 00:01:54.810 
footage of me running around with you

00:01:54.810 --> 00:01:56.959 
footage of me running around with you
know<00:01:54.840> the<00:01:55.140> l96<00:01:55.590> getting<00:01:56.040> headshots<00:01:56.219> up<00:01:56.670> close

00:01:56.959 --> 00:01:56.969 
know the l96 getting headshots up close

00:01:56.969 --> 00:01:59.719 
know the l96 getting headshots up close
and<00:01:57.210> while<00:01:57.750> I<00:01:58.140> could<00:01:58.380> do<00:01:58.560> it<00:01:58.770> it<00:01:58.979> took<00:01:59.399> a<00:01:59.520> very

00:01:59.719 --> 00:01:59.729 
and while I could do it it took a very

00:01:59.729 --> 00:02:02.149 
and while I could do it it took a very
long<00:01:59.909> time<00:02:00.090> to<00:02:00.570> accumulate<00:02:00.899> clips<00:02:01.439> and<00:02:01.710> in

00:02:02.149 --> 00:02:02.159 
long time to accumulate clips and in

00:02:02.159 --> 00:02:04.130 
long time to accumulate clips and in
general<00:02:02.490> I<00:02:02.579> just<00:02:02.610> you<00:02:03.090> know<00:02:03.180> it<00:02:03.299> was<00:02:03.420> fun<00:02:03.719> when

00:02:04.130 --> 00:02:04.140 
general I just you know it was fun when

00:02:04.140 --> 00:02:06.319 
general I just you know it was fun when
you<00:02:04.259> were<00:02:04.320> able<00:02:04.560> to<00:02:04.590> do<00:02:04.829> it<00:02:04.950> but<00:02:05.240> during<00:02:06.240> the

00:02:06.319 --> 00:02:06.329 
you were able to do it but during the

00:02:06.329 --> 00:02:08.389 
you were able to do it but during the
process<00:02:06.780> of<00:02:06.930> getting<00:02:07.380> those<00:02:07.530> gameplay<00:02:08.009> clips

00:02:08.389 --> 00:02:08.399 
process of getting those gameplay clips

00:02:08.399 --> 00:02:11.180 
process of getting those gameplay clips
it<00:02:08.550> was<00:02:08.729> also<00:02:08.940> infuriating<00:02:09.899> so<00:02:10.619> for<00:02:10.830> today<00:02:10.979> I

00:02:11.180 --> 00:02:11.190 
it was also infuriating so for today I

00:02:11.190 --> 00:02:13.380 
it was also infuriating so for today I
pretty<00:02:11.730> much<00:02:11.849> just<00:02:12.060> avoided<00:02:12.810> those<00:02:12.900> issue

00:02:13.380 --> 00:02:13.390 
pretty much just avoided those issue

00:02:13.390 --> 00:02:15.270 
pretty much just avoided those issue
as<00:02:13.750> much<00:02:13.960> as<00:02:14.110> I<00:02:14.170> could<00:02:14.230> I<00:02:14.410> mean<00:02:14.650> every<00:02:14.890> once<00:02:15.160> in

00:02:15.270 --> 00:02:15.280 
as much as I could I mean every once in

00:02:15.280 --> 00:02:17.130 
as much as I could I mean every once in
a<00:02:15.370> while<00:02:15.550> I<00:02:15.790> did<00:02:16.030> push<00:02:16.300> up<00:02:16.540> on<00:02:16.690> the<00:02:16.840> enemy<00:02:17.110> team

00:02:17.130 --> 00:02:17.140 
a while I did push up on the enemy team

00:02:17.140 --> 00:02:19.230 
a while I did push up on the enemy team
to<00:02:17.830> try<00:02:18.040> to<00:02:18.100> get<00:02:18.280> a<00:02:18.310> better<00:02:18.460> vantage<00:02:18.820> point<00:02:18.850> or

00:02:19.230 --> 00:02:19.240 
to try to get a better vantage point or

00:02:19.240 --> 00:02:21.390 
to try to get a better vantage point or
to<00:02:19.330> try<00:02:19.570> to<00:02:19.600> kind<00:02:19.930> of<00:02:20.050> flank<00:02:20.380> them<00:02:20.620> but<00:02:21.190> if<00:02:21.280> I

00:02:21.390 --> 00:02:21.400 
to try to kind of flank them but if I

00:02:21.400 --> 00:02:23.010 
to try to kind of flank them but if I
got<00:02:21.580> into<00:02:21.730> a<00:02:21.790> tight<00:02:22.060> spot<00:02:22.330> I<00:02:22.390> knew<00:02:22.720> a<00:02:22.750> lot<00:02:22.960> of

00:02:23.010 --> 00:02:23.020 
got into a tight spot I knew a lot of

00:02:23.020 --> 00:02:24.870 
got into a tight spot I knew a lot of
enemies<00:02:23.410> were<00:02:23.740> going<00:02:24.010> around<00:02:24.250> the<00:02:24.400> corner<00:02:24.730> I

00:02:24.870 --> 00:02:24.880 
enemies were going around the corner I

00:02:24.880 --> 00:02:26.700 
enemies were going around the corner I
pretty<00:02:25.570> much<00:02:25.660> just<00:02:25.810> avoided<00:02:26.350> that<00:02:26.440> I<00:02:26.470> was<00:02:26.590> like

00:02:26.700 --> 00:02:26.710 
pretty much just avoided that I was like

00:02:26.710 --> 00:02:28.860 
pretty much just avoided that I was like
all<00:02:26.860> right<00:02:26.920> I'm<00:02:27.250> I'm<00:02:27.670> gonna<00:02:27.790> GTFO<00:02:28.360> there's<00:02:28.660> no

00:02:28.860 --> 00:02:28.870 
all right I'm I'm gonna GTFO there's no

00:02:28.870 --> 00:02:30.390 
all right I'm I'm gonna GTFO there's no
reason<00:02:29.230> for<00:02:29.380> me<00:02:29.470> to<00:02:29.500> be<00:02:29.680> here<00:02:29.830> right<00:02:29.890> now<00:02:30.130> so<00:02:30.160> I

00:02:30.390 --> 00:02:30.400 
reason for me to be here right now so I

00:02:30.400 --> 00:02:32.370 
reason for me to be here right now so I
would<00:02:30.610> kind<00:02:31.150> of<00:02:31.240> kite<00:02:31.450> back<00:02:31.660> get<00:02:31.900> into<00:02:32.080> a<00:02:32.110> new

00:02:32.370 --> 00:02:32.380 
would kind of kite back get into a new

00:02:32.380 --> 00:02:34.410 
would kind of kite back get into a new
spot<00:02:32.680> and<00:02:32.830> try<00:02:33.400> to<00:02:33.460> snipe<00:02:33.700> them<00:02:33.970> from<00:02:34.180> range

00:02:34.410 --> 00:02:34.420 
spot and try to snipe them from range

00:02:34.420 --> 00:02:36.360 
spot and try to snipe them from range
because<00:02:34.720> there's<00:02:35.080> just<00:02:35.380> way<00:02:35.680> too<00:02:35.740> many

00:02:36.360 --> 00:02:36.370 
because there's just way too many

00:02:36.370 --> 00:02:38.400 
because there's just way too many
advantages<00:02:36.820> of<00:02:37.090> using<00:02:37.630> this<00:02:37.870> weapon<00:02:38.080> at<00:02:38.380> a

you'll<00:02:41.140> see<00:02:41.290> in<00:02:41.380> this<00:02:41.440> video<00:02:41.590> if<00:02:41.920> if<00:02:42.400> people<00:02:42.700> do

you'll see in this video if if people do

00:02:43.000 --> 00:02:44.940 
you'll see in this video if if people do
fire<00:02:43.330> at<00:02:43.510> me<00:02:43.630> the<00:02:43.840> suppression<00:02:44.320> effect<00:02:44.410> isn't

00:02:44.940 --> 00:02:44.950 
fire at me the suppression effect isn't

00:02:44.950 --> 00:02:47.580 
fire at me the suppression effect isn't
going<00:02:45.220> to<00:02:45.370> hamper<00:02:45.760> my<00:02:46.050> accuracy<00:02:47.050> as<00:02:47.230> much<00:02:47.440> as

00:02:47.580 --> 00:02:47.590 
going to hamper my accuracy as much as

00:02:47.590 --> 00:02:49.949 
going to hamper my accuracy as much as
it<00:02:47.709> does<00:02:47.890> up<00:02:48.220> close<00:02:48.700> I<00:02:48.880> mean<00:02:48.910> the<00:02:49.510> suppression

00:02:49.949 --> 00:02:49.959 
it does up close I mean the suppression

00:02:49.959 --> 00:02:52.110 
it does up close I mean the suppression
effect<00:02:50.050> for<00:02:50.500> bolt-action<00:02:51.130> rifles<00:02:51.459> I<00:02:51.700> think<00:02:51.970> is

00:02:52.110 --> 00:02:52.120 
effect for bolt-action rifles I think is

00:02:52.120 --> 00:02:53.729 
effect for bolt-action rifles I think is
one<00:02:52.420> of<00:02:52.450> the<00:02:52.570> most<00:02:52.780> ridiculous<00:02:53.380> things<00:02:53.590> in

00:02:53.729 --> 00:02:53.739 
one of the most ridiculous things in

00:02:53.739 --> 00:02:55.949 
one of the most ridiculous things in
this<00:02:53.830> game<00:02:54.040> honestly<00:02:54.880> I<00:02:54.910> I<00:02:55.090> think<00:02:55.690> I've<00:02:55.810> said

00:02:55.949 --> 00:02:55.959 
this game honestly I I think I've said

00:02:55.959 --> 00:02:57.300 
this game honestly I I think I've said
this<00:02:56.020> in<00:02:56.200> a<00:02:56.260> previous<00:02:56.440> video<00:02:56.650> many<00:02:56.950> months<00:02:57.220> ago

00:02:57.300 --> 00:02:57.310 
this in a previous video many months ago

00:02:57.310 --> 00:02:59.520 
this in a previous video many months ago
but<00:02:57.910> the<00:02:58.060> suppression<00:02:58.480> effect<00:02:58.570> has<00:02:59.080> way<00:02:59.500> too

00:02:59.520 --> 00:02:59.530 
but the suppression effect has way too

00:02:59.530 --> 00:03:01.890 
but the suppression effect has way too
large<00:03:00.250> of<00:03:00.400> an<00:03:00.550> impact<00:03:00.880> on<00:03:01.030> bolt-action<00:03:01.570> rifles

00:03:01.890 --> 00:03:01.900 
large of an impact on bolt-action rifles

00:03:01.900 --> 00:03:03.870 
large of an impact on bolt-action rifles
simply<00:03:02.500> because<00:03:02.800> one<00:03:03.190> shot<00:03:03.520> can<00:03:03.730> mean<00:03:03.850> the

00:03:03.870 --> 00:03:03.880 
simply because one shot can mean the

00:03:03.880 --> 00:03:05.340 
simply because one shot can mean the
difference<00:03:04.180> between<00:03:04.239> life<00:03:04.690> and<00:03:04.840> death<00:03:04.930> and<00:03:05.170> if

00:03:05.340 --> 00:03:05.350 
difference between life and death and if

00:03:05.350 --> 00:03:08.280 
difference between life and death and if
you<00:03:05.380> do<00:03:05.620> get<00:03:05.860> suppressed<00:03:06.190> heavily<00:03:07.150> on<00:03:07.330> a<00:03:07.810> recon

00:03:08.280 --> 00:03:08.290 
you do get suppressed heavily on a recon

00:03:08.290 --> 00:03:10.470 
you do get suppressed heavily on a recon
you're<00:03:08.920> pretty<00:03:09.220> much<00:03:09.430> toast<00:03:09.850> I<00:03:10.120> mean<00:03:10.270> if<00:03:10.390> they

00:03:10.470 --> 00:03:10.480 
you're pretty much toast I mean if they

00:03:10.480 --> 00:03:12.210 
you're pretty much toast I mean if they
round<00:03:10.720> the<00:03:10.810> corner<00:03:11.290> they're<00:03:11.560> gonna<00:03:11.709> kill<00:03:12.070> you

00:03:12.210 --> 00:03:12.220 
round the corner they're gonna kill you

00:03:12.220 --> 00:03:14.040 
round the corner they're gonna kill you
because<00:03:12.580> your<00:03:12.700> suppressed<00:03:13.150> and<00:03:13.390> if<00:03:13.900> they're

00:03:14.040 --> 00:03:14.050 
because your suppressed and if they're

00:03:14.050 --> 00:03:14.699 
because your suppressed and if they're
off<00:03:14.170> in<00:03:14.290> the<00:03:14.320> distance

00:03:14.699 --> 00:03:14.709 
off in the distance

00:03:14.709 --> 00:03:16.560 
off in the distance
trying<00:03:14.860> to<00:03:14.920> take<00:03:15.040> potshots<00:03:15.280> off<00:03:15.730> you<00:03:15.910> they'll

00:03:16.560 --> 00:03:16.570 
trying to take potshots off you they'll

00:03:16.570 --> 00:03:18.420 
trying to take potshots off you they'll
and<00:03:16.959> if<00:03:17.080> your<00:03:17.200> suppressed<00:03:17.590> heavily<00:03:17.980> there's

00:03:18.420 --> 00:03:18.430 
and if your suppressed heavily there's

00:03:18.430 --> 00:03:20.039 
and if your suppressed heavily there's
no<00:03:18.640> way<00:03:18.850> for<00:03:18.880> you<00:03:19.239> to<00:03:19.330> line<00:03:19.480> up<00:03:19.630> a<00:03:19.690> headshot

00:03:20.039 --> 00:03:20.049 
no way for you to line up a headshot

00:03:20.049 --> 00:03:22.470 
no way for you to line up a headshot
even<00:03:20.440> if<00:03:20.620> you<00:03:21.100> if<00:03:21.580> your<00:03:21.760> crosshairs<00:03:22.299> are

00:03:22.470 --> 00:03:22.480 
even if you if your crosshairs are

00:03:22.480 --> 00:03:23.970 
even if you if your crosshairs are
directly<00:03:22.840> on<00:03:23.049> the<00:03:23.260> target<00:03:23.560> it's<00:03:23.680> it's<00:03:23.860> a<00:03:23.950> very

00:03:23.970 --> 00:03:23.980 
directly on the target it's it's a very

00:03:23.980 --> 00:03:27.030 
directly on the target it's it's a very
annoying<00:03:24.940> thing<00:03:25.480> about<00:03:25.690> the<00:03:26.019> game<00:03:26.230> so<00:03:26.470> pretty

00:03:27.030 --> 00:03:27.040 
annoying thing about the game so pretty

00:03:27.040 --> 00:03:28.800 
annoying thing about the game so pretty
much<00:03:27.160> I<00:03:27.340> just<00:03:27.370> avoid<00:03:27.880> those<00:03:28.150> situations<00:03:28.690> as

00:03:28.800 --> 00:03:28.810 
much I just avoid those situations as

00:03:28.810 --> 00:03:30.479 
much I just avoid those situations as
much<00:03:29.019> as<00:03:29.140> possible<00:03:29.590> if<00:03:29.739> I<00:03:29.890> do<00:03:29.950> get<00:03:30.220> suppressed

00:03:30.479 --> 00:03:30.489 
much as possible if I do get suppressed

00:03:30.489 --> 00:03:32.880 
much as possible if I do get suppressed
I<00:03:30.760> would<00:03:30.940> go<00:03:31.030> behind<00:03:31.180> cover<00:03:31.570> but<00:03:32.260> one<00:03:32.650> way<00:03:32.830> to

00:03:32.880 --> 00:03:32.890 
I would go behind cover but one way to

00:03:32.890 --> 00:03:34.530 
I would go behind cover but one way to
also<00:03:33.340> get<00:03:33.489> around<00:03:33.700> that<00:03:33.880> is<00:03:34.030> just<00:03:34.180> to<00:03:34.269> be<00:03:34.299> at<00:03:34.450> a

00:03:34.530 --> 00:03:34.540 
also get around that is just to be at a

00:03:34.540 --> 00:03:35.789 
also get around that is just to be at a
distance<00:03:34.840> because<00:03:34.959> the<00:03:35.320> suppression<00:03:35.620> effect

00:03:35.789 --> 00:03:35.799 
distance because the suppression effect

00:03:35.799 --> 00:03:38.580 
distance because the suppression effect
isn't<00:03:36.400> as<00:03:36.549> large<00:03:36.910> as<00:03:37.269> if<00:03:37.690> the<00:03:38.110> further<00:03:38.350> and

00:03:38.580 --> 00:03:38.590 
isn't as large as if the further and

00:03:38.590 --> 00:03:40.560 
isn't as large as if the further and
further<00:03:38.739> the<00:03:39.370> target<00:03:39.790> is<00:03:39.940> away<00:03:40.209> from<00:03:40.269> you

00:03:40.560 --> 00:03:40.570 
further the target is away from you

00:03:40.570 --> 00:03:42.300 
further the target is away from you
because<00:03:40.840> their<00:03:40.930> bullets<00:03:41.260> are<00:03:41.380> deviating<00:03:42.130> a

00:03:42.300 --> 00:03:42.310 
because their bullets are deviating a

00:03:42.310 --> 00:03:45.420 
because their bullets are deviating a
lot<00:03:43.030> more<00:03:43.269> at<00:03:43.480> those<00:03:43.660> distances<00:03:44.049> but<00:03:44.890> if<00:03:44.980> I<00:03:45.130> did

00:03:45.420 --> 00:03:45.430 
lot more at those distances but if I did

00:03:45.430 --> 00:03:47.100 
lot more at those distances but if I did
get<00:03:45.610> into<00:03:45.760> a<00:03:45.880> tight<00:03:46.090> spot<00:03:46.299> and<00:03:46.570> I<00:03:46.660> notice<00:03:47.080> that

00:03:47.100 --> 00:03:47.110 
get into a tight spot and I notice that

00:03:47.110 --> 00:03:49.380 
get into a tight spot and I notice that
an<00:03:47.500> enemy<00:03:47.620> was<00:03:48.100> just<00:03:48.549> about<00:03:48.820> to<00:03:49.030> round<00:03:49.239> the

00:03:49.380 --> 00:03:49.390 
an enemy was just about to round the

00:03:49.390 --> 00:03:51.750 
an enemy was just about to round the
corner<00:03:49.750> I<00:03:49.870> would<00:03:49.989> switch<00:03:50.650> on<00:03:50.799> over<00:03:51.070> to<00:03:51.280> my

00:03:51.750 --> 00:03:51.760 
corner I would switch on over to my

00:03:51.760 --> 00:03:54.479 
corner I would switch on over to my
crossbow<00:03:52.390> and<00:03:52.630> I<00:03:52.930> I<00:03:53.260> love<00:03:53.769> the<00:03:53.890> crossbow<00:03:54.340> I<00:03:54.370> I

00:03:54.479 --> 00:03:54.489 
crossbow and I I love the crossbow I I

00:03:54.489 --> 00:03:56.070 
crossbow and I I love the crossbow I I
posted<00:03:55.000> a<00:03:55.120> video<00:03:55.360> recently<00:03:55.630> where<00:03:56.049> I

00:03:56.070 --> 00:03:56.080 
posted a video recently where I

00:03:56.080 --> 00:03:59.009 
posted a video recently where I
exclusively<00:03:56.950> used<00:03:57.310> it<00:03:57.549> on<00:03:57.730> a<00:03:58.299> couple<00:03:58.690> of<00:03:58.780> maps

00:03:59.009 --> 00:03:59.019 
exclusively used it on a couple of maps

00:03:59.019 --> 00:04:01.229 
exclusively used it on a couple of maps
and<00:03:59.230> went<00:03:59.890> on<00:03:59.950> some<00:04:00.160> amazing<00:04:00.430> kill<00:04:00.940> streaks

00:04:01.229 --> 00:04:01.239 
and went on some amazing kill streaks

00:04:01.239 --> 00:04:04.259 
and went on some amazing kill streaks
with<00:04:01.810> just<00:04:02.200> that<00:04:02.410> and<00:04:02.650> my<00:04:02.830> knife<00:04:03.070> and<00:04:03.370> I<00:04:03.670> think

00:04:04.259 --> 00:04:04.269 
with just that and my knife and I think

00:04:04.269 --> 00:04:05.940 
with just that and my knife and I think
it<00:04:04.420> suits<00:04:04.600> the<00:04:04.840> Recon<00:04:05.140> class<00:04:05.350> very<00:04:05.680> well<00:04:05.920> I

00:04:05.940 --> 00:04:05.950 
it suits the Recon class very well I

00:04:05.950 --> 00:04:08.250 
it suits the Recon class very well I
don't<00:04:06.340> use<00:04:06.670> it<00:04:06.880> very<00:04:06.910> often<00:04:07.420> in<00:04:07.780> today's<00:04:07.900> video

00:04:08.250 --> 00:04:08.260 
don't use it very often in today's video

00:04:08.260 --> 00:04:10.560 
don't use it very often in today's video
but<00:04:08.590> that<00:04:08.709> was<00:04:08.830> because<00:04:09.190> I<00:04:09.579> was<00:04:09.850> trying<00:04:10.450> to

00:04:10.560 --> 00:04:10.570 
but that was because I was trying to

00:04:10.570 --> 00:04:11.880 
but that was because I was trying to
keep<00:04:10.720> people<00:04:10.930> at<00:04:11.170> a<00:04:11.200> distance<00:04:11.290> and<00:04:11.739> I<00:04:11.769> was

keep people at a distance and I was

00:04:11.890 --> 00:04:14.280 
keep people at a distance and I was
trying<00:04:12.100> to<00:04:12.190> avoid<00:04:12.280> those<00:04:12.850> confrontations<00:04:13.660> but

00:04:14.280 --> 00:04:14.290 
trying to avoid those confrontations but

00:04:14.290 --> 00:04:15.750 
trying to avoid those confrontations but
if<00:04:14.500> you<00:04:14.709> do<00:04:14.890> get<00:04:15.040> into<00:04:15.220> a<00:04:15.250> tight<00:04:15.519> spot

00:04:34.740 --> 00:04:34.750 
the Recon class simply because the

00:04:34.750 --> 00:04:37.260 
the Recon class simply because the
information<00:04:35.050> that<00:04:35.380> you<00:04:35.650> get<00:04:35.919> with<00:04:36.069> it<00:04:36.280> is<00:04:36.880> just

00:04:37.260 --> 00:04:37.270 
information that you get with it is just

00:04:37.270 --> 00:04:39.930 
information that you get with it is just
so<00:04:37.599> so<00:04:38.259> valuable<00:04:38.830> and<00:04:39.190> I<00:04:39.400> do<00:04:39.460> agree<00:04:39.729> with<00:04:39.789> you

so so valuable and I do agree with you

so so valuable and I do agree with you
and<00:04:40.210> not<00:04:40.449> because<00:04:40.750> but<00:04:40.900> because<00:04:41.169> I'm<00:04:41.319> playing

00:04:41.520 --> 00:04:41.530

00:04:43.840 --> 00:04:46.680 
TDM and because this map is so
close-quarter<00:04:44.800> I<00:04:45.069> figured<00:04:45.849> that<00:04:46.060> I<00:04:46.210> think

00:04:46.680 --> 00:04:46.690 
close-quarter I figured that I think

00:04:46.690 --> 00:04:49.290 
close-quarter I figured that I think
that<00:04:46.900> this<00:04:47.110> is<00:04:47.289> an<00:04:47.470> appropriate<00:04:47.860> map<00:04:48.340> for<00:04:48.789> this

00:04:49.290 --> 00:04:49.300 
that this is an appropriate map for this

00:04:49.300 --> 00:04:52.710 
that this is an appropriate map for this
type<00:04:49.599> of<00:04:49.630> setup<00:04:50.009> so<00:04:51.009> now<00:04:51.250> that<00:04:51.310> we<00:04:51.669> are<00:04:51.970> nearing

00:04:52.710 --> 00:04:52.720 
type of setup so now that we are nearing

00:04:52.720 --> 00:04:54.749 
type of setup so now that we are nearing
the<00:04:52.840> end<00:04:52.960> of<00:04:53.470> this<00:04:53.620> very<00:04:53.889> long<00:04:54.069> streak<00:04:54.639> I
