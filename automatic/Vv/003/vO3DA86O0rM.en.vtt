00:02:13.050 --> 00:02:13.060 
when everybody ducks into the door

00:02:13.060 --> 00:02:15.300 
when everybody ducks into the door
everyone<00:02:13.780> becomes<00:02:14.170> equal<00:02:14.739> in<00:02:14.920> the<00:02:15.099> room

00:02:17.640 --> 00:02:17.650 
because everyone had to go through this

00:02:17.650 --> 00:02:20.309 
because everyone had to go through this
situation<00:02:18.340> where<00:02:18.609> they<00:02:18.910> weren't<00:02:19.150> the<00:02:20.079> MCUs

everybody on the same level to get into
the<00:02:24.609> room<00:02:24.790> so<00:02:25.359> it<00:02:25.569> creates<00:02:25.900> an<00:02:26.170> atmosphere<00:02:26.410> of

00:02:26.910 --> 00:02:26.920

comfort for people going to the tea

00:02:30.370 --> 00:02:32.580 
comfort for people going to the tea
ceremony<00:02:30.609> so<00:02:31.299> they<00:02:31.870> still<00:02:32.079> have<00:02:32.230> that<00:02:32.260> door

00:02:32.580 --> 00:02:32.590

00:02:35.490 --> 00:02:35.500 
through it which is probably gonna be

00:02:35.500 --> 00:02:47.160 
through it which is probably gonna be
pretty<00:02:35.530> funny

00:02:47.160 --> 00:02:47.170 

00:02:47.170 --> 00:02:51.280
