00:02:15.799 --> 00:02:20.090
 you will hardly connect to pc 

00:02:17.690 --> 00:02:23.090

00:02:30.620 --> 00:02:38.569
 nothing beats good here is the right cable 

00:02:35.590 --> 00:02:41.510
 the cable connector you connect or 

00:02:38.569 --> 00:02:44.989

00:02:41.510 --> 00:02:47.500

00:02:47.500 --> 00:02:55.270
 and here's the headset 

00:02:50.510 --> 00:03:02.209
 oh my god, the apple headset 

00:02:55.270 --> 00:03:04.940

00:03:02.209 --> 00:03:06.470
 My god is not going, can you? 

00:03:04.940 --> 00:03:08.600
 is the new was still with that format 

00:03:06.470 --> 00:03:11.680
 that they talk from the past three years to 

00:03:08.600 --> 00:03:17.810
 to do is not that is a very old 

00:03:11.680 --> 00:03:20.360
 focus this and the one that is the box that you 

00:03:17.810 --> 00:03:21.560
 You will use use on a daily basis every time 

00:03:20.360 --> 00:03:23.959
 Are you going to leave the box? 

00:03:21.560 --> 00:03:25.519
 very important, but it is not 

00:03:23.959 --> 00:03:28.550
 good here 

00:03:25.519 --> 00:03:31.790
 this version 16 gigas the only one that sells 

00:03:28.550 --> 00:03:35.690
 now it's eight gigs canceled by pulling 

00:03:31.790 --> 00:03:37.760
 already 1682 is 64 from the market 

00:03:35.690 --> 00:03:39.080
 That's why I bought it soon with 16 

00:03:37.760 --> 00:03:42.470
 because I still had a touch with wen in the 

00:03:39.080 --> 00:03:44.180
 hail right and valencia hail on the site 

00:03:42.470 --> 00:03:45.019
 from hail I really enjoyed the delivery was 

00:03:44.180 --> 00:03:49.250
 fast 

00:03:45.019 --> 00:03:59.239
 good there makes the settings and 

00:03:49.250 --> 00:04:01.690
 this is so cool and now the device does 

00:03:59.239 --> 00:04:05.269
 a while the battery was running out 

00:04:01.690 --> 00:04:07.910
 button to labor and 50 ac battery 

00:04:05.269 --> 00:04:09.739
 simple apple né do s 7 vamos 

00:04:07.910 --> 00:04:14.720
 take it out here because this here 

00:04:09.739 --> 00:04:16.160
 Bother simpler than I liked was in the 

00:04:14.720 --> 00:04:18.769
 edges right 

00:04:16.160 --> 00:04:22.160
 I had not taken the edges so 

00:04:18.769 --> 00:04:25.100
 All clarity is clear I never took one 

00:04:22.160 --> 00:04:28.100
 I feel like it's mine, this is mine. 

00:04:25.100 --> 00:04:31.280
 so the edges of it passes the impression 

00:04:28.100 --> 00:04:33.830
 that iphone5 that part here has changed from 

00:04:31.280 --> 00:04:36.520
 koné became black or white as well as 

00:04:33.830 --> 00:04:39.169
 so you get the impression that 

00:04:36.520 --> 00:04:41.350
 You only know this here. 

00:04:39.169 --> 00:04:56.380
 here came out for that right impression 

00:04:41.350 --> 00:04:56.380
 We are going to be right 5% of our battery focus 

00:04:57.590 --> 00:05:03.780
 and that's it, I will not go any further 

00:05:00.510 --> 00:05:07.500
 so much so, because here is only one 

00:05:03.780 --> 00:05:09.480
 Boxing can not spend several minutes 

00:05:07.500 --> 00:05:17.340
 so here's the back we'll show you 

00:05:09.480 --> 00:05:19.410
 the design is that I come back some photos 

00:05:17.340 --> 00:05:21.900
 It did not come here for you to see. 

00:05:19.410 --> 00:05:28.560

00:05:58.890 --> 00:06:02.550
