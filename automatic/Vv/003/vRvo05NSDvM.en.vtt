00:00:00.290 --> 00:00:04.529
 the center for clinical skills 

00:00:03.060 --> 00:00:08.250
 The Foundation Veterinary College 

00:00:04.529 --> 00:00:11.900
 Hannover puts in this video handling 

00:00:08.250 --> 00:00:14.849
 and coercive measures in front of the cat 

00:00:11.900 --> 00:00:17.279
 the procedure have to be first 

00:00:14.849 --> 00:00:20.359
 presented to a stuffed animal and in the 

00:00:17.279 --> 00:00:23.910
 connecting it to a live cat 

00:00:20.359 --> 00:00:25.800
 Fixation measures at the cat lead 

00:00:23.910 --> 00:00:27.990
 easy to defend against 

00:00:25.800 --> 00:00:30.300
 That's why dealing with cats 

00:00:27.990 --> 00:00:32.279
 be careful about one 

00:00:30.300 --> 00:00:33.770
 examination and treatment too 

00:00:32.279 --> 00:00:36.329
 enable 

00:00:33.770 --> 00:00:38.820
 The fabric cat is shown first 

00:00:36.329 --> 00:00:40.850
 like these from a transport box 

00:00:38.820 --> 00:00:43.260
 is removed 

00:00:40.850 --> 00:00:45.660
 one hand becomes the body 

00:00:43.260 --> 00:00:48.270
 kept in the under chest and belly 

00:00:45.660 --> 00:00:51.539
 the other hand secures the other hand 

00:00:48.270 --> 00:00:54.510
 A cat's head can be pictured like her 

00:00:51.539 --> 00:00:56.699
 in a cloth or for example in a 

00:00:54.510 --> 00:00:59.090
 Towel or wrapped in a blanket 

00:00:56.699 --> 00:01:00.930
 become a secure fixation 

00:00:59.090 --> 00:01:03.300
 can be made 

00:01:00.930 --> 00:01:05.760
 This approach is suitable for 

00:01:03.300 --> 00:01:07.220
 example of a blood test at the 

00:01:05.760 --> 00:01:09.840
 fore-limb 

00:01:07.220 --> 00:01:12.210
 Another possibility is wearing it 

00:01:09.840 --> 00:01:13.860
 from safety gloves with one 

00:01:12.210 --> 00:01:16.979
 Safety glove can cat like 

00:01:13.860 --> 00:01:18.000
 shown here consistently on the table 

00:01:16.979 --> 00:01:20.159
 be fixed 

00:01:18.000 --> 00:01:22.970
 the fingers also grip on the 

00:01:20.159 --> 00:01:22.970
 head of the cat 

00:01:23.610 --> 00:01:27.420
 because cats are in spite of 

00:01:25.380 --> 00:01:29.370
 Do not treat sedatives 

00:01:27.420 --> 00:01:31.620
 leave if necessary 

00:01:29.370 --> 00:01:33.540
 coercive measures are taken around 

00:01:31.620 --> 00:01:37.100
 also the risk of injury in all 

00:01:33.540 --> 00:01:37.100
 minimize the number of people involved 

00:01:38.470 --> 00:01:42.940
 last the possibility is shown the 

00:01:40.540 --> 00:01:45.910
 to put cat in one inevitably 

00:01:42.940 --> 00:01:49.440
 The cat is in the cage 

00:01:45.910 --> 00:01:49.440
 be closed quickly 

00:01:53.430 --> 00:01:58.560
 with the bar is the flexible 

00:01:56.440 --> 00:02:01.150
 shifted sidewall 

00:01:58.560 --> 00:02:04.480
 The cat is between the 

00:02:01.150 --> 00:02:06.610
 walls can fix another person 

00:02:04.480 --> 00:02:08.280
 now, for example, an injection 

00:02:06.610 --> 00:02:11.860
 make 

00:02:08.280 --> 00:02:14.350
 in the connection now becomes the handling and the 

00:02:11.860 --> 00:02:17.800
 hold and fixate on one 

00:02:14.350 --> 00:02:19.930
 Loving cat shown the cat will 

00:02:17.800 --> 00:02:22.210
 taken from your transport box 

00:02:19.930 --> 00:02:24.490
 a cat no defensive reactions 

00:02:22.210 --> 00:02:25.600
 Shows on the arm on the body 

00:02:24.490 --> 00:02:28.030
 being held 

00:02:25.600 --> 00:02:29.980
 now it is shown how to cat out 

00:02:28.030 --> 00:02:32.980
 the box takes and on the 

00:02:29.980 --> 00:02:35.380
 Examination table sets with both 

00:02:32.980 --> 00:02:37.750
 hands, the cat is touched one 

00:02:35.380 --> 00:02:39.940
 Hand reaches under belly and chest the 

00:02:37.750 --> 00:02:41.700
 Another hand secures the cat from above 

00:02:39.940 --> 00:02:44.380
 in the shoulder area 

00:02:41.700 --> 00:02:47.830
 this process is repeated here 

00:02:44.380 --> 00:02:50.380
 the cat is shown out the same way 

00:02:47.830 --> 00:02:51.760
 taken that the head of the animal body 

00:02:50.380 --> 00:02:54.310
 is kept away 

00:02:51.760 --> 00:02:56.890
 First, the cat can be from both sides 

00:02:54.310 --> 00:02:59.860
 on the shoulder belt and the front legs 

00:02:56.890 --> 00:03:01.810
 to be held around the cat 

00:02:59.860 --> 00:03:03.640
 it is easy to bounce 

00:03:01.810 --> 00:03:05.070
 Movements on the head of the animal 

00:03:03.640 --> 00:03:07.959
 carry out 

00:03:05.070 --> 00:03:09.970
 supportive is the body close hold 

00:03:07.959 --> 00:03:15.820
 the cat with simultaneous fixation 

00:03:09.970 --> 00:03:17.260
 of the animal between the forearms for 

00:03:15.820 --> 00:03:19.270
 the examination becomes the fore-legs 

00:03:17.260 --> 00:03:21.700
 with one hand by means of three handle 

00:03:19.270 --> 00:03:24.540
 fixed in the finger around the outside 

00:03:21.700 --> 00:03:25.720
 forelimbs and between the forelegs 

00:03:24.540 --> 00:03:27.550
 to grab 

00:03:25.720 --> 00:03:30.220
 the other hand turns the head 

00:03:27.550 --> 00:03:32.709
 held in principle it makes sense 

00:03:30.220 --> 00:03:34.989
 especially when the cat is restless 

00:03:32.709 --> 00:03:37.030
 the box from the examination table too 

00:03:34.989 --> 00:03:39.820
 do not remove the cat 

00:03:37.030 --> 00:03:42.180
 interest in it has back to the box too 

00:03:39.820 --> 00:03:42.180
 reach 

00:03:44.830 --> 00:03:49.180
 through the grip between and around the 

00:03:46.480 --> 00:03:50.980
 front legs as you can see here 

00:03:49.180 --> 00:03:52.960
 be well secured 

00:03:50.980 --> 00:03:56.580
 You can massage and crawl with it 

00:03:52.960 --> 00:03:56.580
 try to calm the cat 

00:03:56.980 --> 00:04:02.170
 for the blood collection one positions the 

00:03:59.950 --> 00:04:03.549
 Cat at the edge of the table becomes a leg 

00:04:02.170 --> 00:04:07.030
 proxy times around that 

00:04:03.549 --> 00:04:08.709
 at the same time the vein is stowed 

00:04:07.030 --> 00:04:11.140
 The cat's head is held that way 

00:04:08.709 --> 00:04:13.680
 all fingers went down under the jaw 

00:04:11.140 --> 00:04:16.329
 and the thumb is turned upside down 

00:04:13.680 --> 00:04:18.459
 The head may be during the examination 

00:04:16.329 --> 00:04:20.019
 be easily stretched upward to 

00:04:18.459 --> 00:04:21.880
 you reduce the danger of being bitten 

00:04:20.019 --> 00:04:24.660
 you will be well under the head 

00:04:21.880 --> 00:04:24.660
 has control 

00:04:27.880 --> 00:04:32.140
 If you want the blood on the hind leg 

00:04:29.890 --> 00:04:33.520
 make the cat on the side 

00:04:32.140 --> 00:04:35.620
 placed and held 

00:04:33.520 --> 00:04:38.110
 the front legs are fixed again 

00:04:35.620 --> 00:04:39.820
 the three handle and that way you 

00:04:38.110 --> 00:04:42.130
 when needed for example if the cat 

00:04:39.820 --> 00:04:43.650
 White wants to head with his forearm 

00:04:42.130 --> 00:04:47.290
 can push down 

00:04:43.650 --> 00:04:49.990
 are the hind legs and paws 

00:04:47.290 --> 00:04:51.730
 with the other hand fixed for the 

00:04:49.990 --> 00:04:54.040
 blood loss will then be the bottom 

00:04:51.730 --> 00:04:55.450
 Photo of the person taking blood 

00:04:54.040 --> 00:04:57.550
 pulled forward 

00:04:55.450 --> 00:05:00.750
 the person the cat on the legs 

00:04:57.550 --> 00:05:03.280
 At the same time, the vein is keeping in check 

00:05:00.750 --> 00:05:05.050
 this will be the point at this point 

00:05:03.280 --> 00:05:07.510
 a collar at the cat 

00:05:05.050 --> 00:05:09.310
 the cat will show off for that 

00:05:07.510 --> 00:05:11.260
 your transport box lifted 

00:05:09.310 --> 00:05:13.090
 the box is taken from the examination table 

00:05:11.260 --> 00:05:15.660
 Do not take the cat back with it 

00:05:13.090 --> 00:05:15.660
 can jump 

00:05:17.409 --> 00:05:23.000
 before wearing the neck 

00:05:20.150 --> 00:05:25.939
 is checked whether the neck collar the 

00:05:23.000 --> 00:05:27.800
 This neck collar has the right length 

00:05:25.939 --> 00:05:30.250
 already closed and with a 

00:05:27.800 --> 00:05:32.599
 collar has been provided 

00:05:30.250 --> 00:05:35.090
 The cat is held in front of the body 

00:05:32.599 --> 00:05:38.020
 and the neck will now carry more than 

00:05:35.090 --> 00:05:38.020
 put the head over 

00:05:38.849 --> 00:05:44.249
 The collar is closed behind it 

00:05:42.300 --> 00:05:47.189
 should have two fingers under the 

00:05:44.249 --> 00:05:49.789
 collar fits with the cat comfortably 

00:05:47.189 --> 00:05:49.789
 can breathe 

00:06:00.630 --> 00:06:06.160
 finally, the seat of the hall collar is 

00:06:03.310 --> 00:06:08.580
 checked by carefully pulling on it 

00:06:06.160 --> 00:06:08.580
 becomes 

00:06:09.590 --> 00:06:15.260
 it lends itself to less cooperative 

00:06:12.680 --> 00:06:17.810
 putting cats on a neck trench 

00:06:15.260 --> 00:06:19.850
 to conduct an investigation 

00:06:17.810 --> 00:06:23.260
 the cats feel through the neck 

00:06:19.850 --> 00:06:23.260
 Do not wear too disturbed 

00:06:23.720 --> 00:06:28.670
 in lateral position one reaches again over the 

00:06:26.270 --> 00:06:32.140
 elbow and asal joints and can the 

00:06:28.670 --> 00:06:32.140
 secure cat by doing so 

00:06:38.520 --> 00:06:43.779
 The cat will also wear it with his neck 

00:06:41.139 --> 00:06:46.449
 so fixed that four fingers under the 

00:06:43.779 --> 00:06:49.409
 grasp the lower jaw and thumb on the thumb 

00:06:46.449 --> 00:06:49.409
 lies behind 

00:06:51.249 --> 00:06:55.419
 so that the cat does not deal with the 

00:06:53.109 --> 00:06:57.189
 Rear part of her body moved strongly 

00:06:55.419 --> 00:07:00.609
 you can get it through your forearms 

00:06:57.189 --> 00:07:01.209
 fix and you additionally body after 

00:07:00.609 --> 00:07:03.549
 hold 

00:07:01.209 --> 00:07:07.289
 Here is the positioning again 

00:07:03.549 --> 00:07:07.289
 shown for blood loss 

00:07:08.460 --> 00:07:13.390
 will remove dig around the neck, the 

00:07:11.470 --> 00:07:17.610
 opened as a band and the neck collar 

00:07:13.390 --> 00:07:17.610
 carefully pulled over the head 

00:07:18.120 --> 00:07:22.620
 The cat is now while you also the 

00:07:20.669 --> 00:07:24.570
 paws pay attention back to the 

00:07:22.620 --> 00:07:27.590
 Transport container set and this one 

00:07:24.570 --> 00:07:27.590
 will be closed again
