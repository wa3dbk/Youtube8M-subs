00:00:17.330 --> 00:00:22.080
 oleander this large forever green 

00:00:20.400 --> 00:00:23.189
 attributed to the bush magical 

00:00:22.080 --> 00:00:25.800
 properties 

00:00:23.189 --> 00:00:27.689
 despite the fact that the plant is poisonous it 

00:00:25.800 --> 00:00:30.060
 willingly grown as indoor 

00:00:27.689 --> 00:00:33.000
 it is believed that oleander takes in 

00:00:30.060 --> 00:00:35.820
 yourself the energy of poisonous desires freeing 

00:00:33.000 --> 00:00:38.309
 space for the energy of love and therefore 

00:00:35.820 --> 00:00:40.649
 the very atmosphere of the house helps a person 

00:00:38.309 --> 00:00:42.530
 forget about bad habits and do 

00:00:40.649 --> 00:00:44.850
 something useful for the soul 

00:00:42.530 --> 00:00:47.129
 acting on the principle of attraction 

00:00:44.850 --> 00:00:49.530
 like he takes out of man 

00:00:47.129 --> 00:00:52.320
 poisonous desire eliminates 

00:00:49.530 --> 00:00:56.070
 depressed mood and still improves 

00:00:52.320 --> 00:00:59.719
 delighting him with bright abundant flowers he 

00:00:56.070 --> 00:01:03.120
 he blooms here on a branch 

00:00:59.719 --> 00:01:06.420
 1216 flowers from just like that 

00:01:03.120 --> 00:01:08.729
 bunch of pink flower flowers here I have 

00:01:06.420 --> 00:01:12.900
 pink but she is also white and 

00:01:08.729 --> 00:01:15.720
 red and therefore such a hat of flowers 

00:01:12.900 --> 00:01:18.600
 blooms until late autumn 

00:01:15.720 --> 00:01:21.960
 but he literally when quite short 

00:01:18.600 --> 00:01:23.180
 days come to you some in december he 

00:01:21.960 --> 00:01:25.710
 ceases asti 

00:01:23.180 --> 00:01:28.649
 growing oleander is unpretentious 

00:01:25.710 --> 00:01:32.539
 used as a room so as 

00:01:28.649 --> 00:01:37.259
 garden plant well cuttings its and 

00:01:32.539 --> 00:01:39.320
 it is well rooted cuttings very 

00:01:37.259 --> 00:01:43.860
 loves sunny 

00:01:39.320 --> 00:01:50.939
 sunny windows the sun loves very flower 

00:01:43.860 --> 00:01:52.799
 this one, well, how general is it considered pure 

00:01:50.939 --> 00:01:56.420
 indoor plant in the ground it is not 

00:01:52.799 --> 00:01:57.840
 planting along with pots stand on the street 

00:01:56.420 --> 00:02:01.560
 note 

00:01:57.840 --> 00:02:02.399
 when it rains and overall I once 

00:02:01.560 --> 00:02:06.119
 made 

00:02:02.399 --> 00:02:09.509
 and flowers from the daughter will pass and then the sun 

00:02:06.119 --> 00:02:13.740
 immediately abruptly after the rain and flowers 

00:02:09.509 --> 00:02:16.620
 burn they have no time yet 

00:02:13.740 --> 00:02:19.770
 how to bake or evaporate from a flower and they 

00:02:16.620 --> 00:02:22.680
 right ugly loses decorativeness and 

00:02:19.770 --> 00:02:26.459
 I later became him somewhere under the cover 

00:02:22.680 --> 00:02:27.959
 set to but if when at home in 

00:02:26.459 --> 00:02:29.250
 leave let's say it started to rain 

00:02:27.959 --> 00:02:34.350
 quickly made 

00:02:29.250 --> 00:02:37.410
 its under the roof and since he even think 

00:02:34.350 --> 00:02:38.310
 garden plant he likes in 

00:02:37.410 --> 00:02:41.310
 gardens grow 

00:02:38.310 --> 00:02:44.460
 not to fall under the daughter but not 

00:02:41.310 --> 00:02:46.310
 recommended with leaves nothing 

00:02:44.460 --> 00:02:49.500
 done here the flowers lose their decorativeness 

00:02:46.310 --> 00:02:51.540
 as a houseplant, oleander blooms 

00:02:49.500 --> 00:02:54.450
 very richly need only to manifest 

00:02:51.540 --> 00:02:57.720
 patience and properly form a bush 

00:02:54.450 --> 00:03:02.880
 if here's the sunny side and on the window 

00:02:57.720 --> 00:03:06.540
 can bloom all year round firstly 

00:03:02.880 --> 00:03:12.959
 fast growing such a plant he zagato 

00:03:06.540 --> 00:03:15.170
 very gains in growth let's say in this 

00:03:12.959 --> 00:03:19.080
 year made after how much you bloom 

00:03:15.170 --> 00:03:22.650
 he can you little bloom but in this 

00:03:19.080 --> 00:03:24.860
 year it may not bloom and the next 

00:03:22.650 --> 00:03:29.459
 the year will surely bloom 

00:03:24.860 --> 00:03:32.760
 first see still the fact is that if 

00:03:29.459 --> 00:03:34.820
 cutting let's say you planted it grows in 

00:03:32.760 --> 00:03:37.530
 one stem 

00:03:34.820 --> 00:03:40.920
 if you want to convey decorative 

00:03:37.530 --> 00:03:42.440
 this plant so that you have it growth lush 

00:03:40.920 --> 00:03:45.570
 was so compact 

00:03:42.440 --> 00:03:50.070
 you need to pinch you pinch and 

00:03:45.570 --> 00:03:54.630
 here now let's say about the leaves in the sinuses 

00:03:50.070 --> 00:03:58.440
 leaves from the bosom went two escapes from 

00:03:54.630 --> 00:04:01.380
 these two escapes have grown some let's say 

00:03:58.440 --> 00:04:05.880
 10 centimeters you pinch them again 

00:04:01.380 --> 00:04:08.459
 of these two shoots already gone 4 he 

00:04:05.880 --> 00:04:10.500
 just be compact and decorative and 

00:04:08.459 --> 00:04:13.440
 if not pinch it in one branch 

00:04:10.500 --> 00:04:17.579
 he will rarely grow at all 

00:04:13.440 --> 00:04:20.010
 let's say some of the side shoots from 

00:04:17.579 --> 00:04:22.140
 the sinuses from the shoots gives you the need 

00:04:20.010 --> 00:04:25.050
 pinch to create a decorative 

00:04:22.140 --> 00:04:28.320
 but what if you pinch you 

00:04:25.050 --> 00:04:31.160
 Here is the point of growth is acceptable delete the same 

00:04:28.320 --> 00:04:34.770
 where this flower bud is formed 

00:04:31.160 --> 00:04:37.099
 so he can you while you create 

00:04:34.770 --> 00:04:41.550
 are the plants themselves 

00:04:37.099 --> 00:04:42.090
 two or three years to go so then he you 

00:04:41.550 --> 00:04:44.610
 for the cycle 

00:04:42.090 --> 00:04:47.790
 but then youâ€™ll have it there 

00:04:44.610 --> 00:04:48.480
 8-10 shoots and imagine from each 

00:04:47.790 --> 00:04:52.020
 escape 

00:04:48.480 --> 00:04:55.229
 there is a flower bud above 

00:04:52.020 --> 00:04:59.729
 and he is such to be decorative beautiful 

00:04:55.229 --> 00:05:03.270
 wipe like here literally here 

00:04:59.729 --> 00:05:06.540
 see three escapes yes and here are three brushes 

00:05:03.270 --> 00:05:09.750
 flower so here too here they 

00:05:06.540 --> 00:05:13.979
 already pinch everything and here on two big 

00:05:09.750 --> 00:05:17.340
 already calling a flower brush on those on two 

00:05:13.979 --> 00:05:20.930
 there are no small ones yet and here near here 

00:05:17.340 --> 00:05:24.900
 I have already felt this way with my hands . 

00:05:20.930 --> 00:05:27.240
 flower already ensued not worth 

00:05:24.900 --> 00:05:29.460
 forget that oleander shrub when 

00:05:27.240 --> 00:05:31.770
 buying it may look compact 

00:05:29.460 --> 00:05:34.560
 plant but keep in mind that taste 

00:05:31.770 --> 00:05:37.169
 grows and can reach two meters 

00:05:34.560 --> 00:05:40.880
 he will need a large room 

00:05:37.169 --> 00:05:40.880
 they are a small windowsill 

00:05:49.300 --> 00:05:51.360
 or
