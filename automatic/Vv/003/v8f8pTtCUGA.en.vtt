 is car business executive sports 

00:00:43.920 --> 00:00:49.410
 from starting with a short 

00:00:46.949 --> 00:00:59.479
 statement racing game and cheaper 

00:00:49.410 --> 00:01:02.159
 Barley please continue to work diligently 

00:00:59.479 --> 00:01:03.690
 and have done that today conviction 

00:01:02.159 --> 00:01:05.190
 I am with the way of ours 

00:01:03.690 --> 00:01:08.630
 very satisfied 

00:01:05.190 --> 00:01:12.869
 not only do they stretch clearly 

00:01:08.630 --> 00:01:15.060
 risen brings in the end is that 

00:01:12.869 --> 00:01:16.380
 result largely in the area 

00:01:15.060 --> 00:01:19.470
 believe that we are the finer overall 

00:01:16.380 --> 00:01:22.289
 have beaten blade a bit 

00:01:19.470 --> 00:01:26.670
 angefressen if that is a reference of 

00:01:22.289 --> 00:01:27.509
 Michael falls two fouls the whole 

00:01:26.670 --> 00:01:29.250
 play 

00:01:27.509 --> 00:01:33.060
 losses of plants us naturally 

00:01:29.250 --> 00:01:36.679
 against chemnitz there were players who have 

00:01:33.060 --> 00:01:36.679
 significantly more accomplished 

00:01:39.800 --> 00:01:44.130
 I think that we are a very very 

00:01:42.000 --> 00:01:45.420
 have seen intense play for us 

00:01:44.130 --> 00:01:47.759
 important that you also the residue 

00:01:45.420 --> 00:01:52.979
 relatively quickly then to compensate 

00:01:47.759 --> 00:01:54.300
 have come to work in one place 

00:01:52.979 --> 00:01:56.010
 feel that 

00:01:54.300 --> 00:02:00.540
 they do not have that for a long time 

00:01:56.010 --> 00:02:02.070
 I think that too 

00:02:00.540 --> 00:02:04.620
 that hope maybe that's what the 

00:02:02.070 --> 00:02:07.410
 That's why they stand there, too 

00:02:04.620 --> 00:02:08.280
 at the top of the something well maintained in the 

00:02:07.410 --> 00:02:09.960
 play football 

00:02:08.280 --> 00:02:12.300
 Nevertheless, I think that we are at the end of the 

00:02:09.960 --> 00:02:13.980
 Maybe it was sometimes the game 

00:02:12.300 --> 00:02:16.320
 the clearest chance to use in one time 

00:02:13.980 --> 00:02:17.520
 that's why the game is for us 

00:02:16.320 --> 00:02:21.030
 decide 

00:02:17.520 --> 00:02:23.750
 even if you do that then it works too 

00:02:21.030 --> 00:02:23.750
 the result 

00:02:25.560 --> 00:02:30.489
 my ladies always the possibility of theirs 

00:02:28.689 --> 00:02:36.389
 to ask questions use to know where 

00:02:30.489 --> 00:02:36.389
 thomas reichenberger picture 

00:02:48.030 --> 00:02:52.980
 He had muscular problems and risk 

00:02:51.760 --> 00:02:55.450
 enter into 

00:02:52.980 --> 00:02:57.870
 currently the work has to be down 

00:02:55.450 --> 00:02:57.870
 given 

00:02:59.960 --> 00:03:06.330
 Team of the final stage mostly 

00:03:03.810 --> 00:03:09.530
 the last play again won 

00:03:06.330 --> 00:03:09.530
 has the animals later 

00:03:11.110 --> 00:03:16.910
 I want now because I'm glad that 

00:03:14.630 --> 00:03:21.950
 we are in a situation we do in 

00:03:16.910 --> 00:03:23.180
 to be able to do something again 

00:03:21.950 --> 00:03:27.230
 The time now is at 1 

00:03:23.180 --> 00:03:29.920
 romantic advantages in the gray ones 

00:03:27.230 --> 00:03:29.920
 to win games 

00:03:34.960 --> 00:03:37.960
 2 

00:03:41.390 --> 00:03:44.390
 about that 

00:03:56.580 --> 00:04:00.780
 First of all, I do not have to ask something 

00:03:59.020 --> 00:04:04.090
 but were still something to it 

00:04:00.780 --> 00:04:05.410
 for one 15 minutes exactly the same 

00:04:04.090 --> 00:04:07.120
 Germany's leadership in moments 

00:04:05.410 --> 00:04:08.620
 You should not forget if you were 

00:04:07.120 --> 00:04:10.290
 then the whole thing goes into the lead 

00:04:08.620 --> 00:04:12.250
 play bad that the second 

00:04:10.290 --> 00:04:14.440
 conditional before the disadvantage on the 

00:04:12.250 --> 00:04:16.000
 a page itself is not 

00:04:14.440 --> 00:04:17.470
 all competitive games week for 

00:04:16.000 --> 00:04:20.019
 week and does not raise any positive 

00:04:17.470 --> 00:04:21.880
 or negative if you're outnumbered 

00:04:20.019 --> 00:04:23.080
 game is just the last good 

00:04:21.880 --> 00:04:25.300
 it will be hard to work hard 

00:04:23.080 --> 00:04:28.480
 have operated over the whole game time 

00:04:25.300 --> 00:04:30.520
 really played the football and in 

00:04:28.480 --> 00:04:32.020
 one less is apparently what it looks like 

00:04:30.520 --> 00:04:34.600
 as if the obama I have the 

00:04:32.020 --> 00:04:36.300
 Correct all subordinate to theirs 

00:04:34.600 --> 00:04:39.700
 ask to be answered 

00:04:36.300 --> 00:04:41.440
 I have the impression that they were the 

00:04:39.700 --> 00:04:42.760
 The last two are not playing anymore 

00:04:41.440 --> 00:04:45.040
 freshest the freshest impression 

00:04:42.760 --> 00:04:47.020
 made it so very clear 

00:04:45.040 --> 00:04:48.850
 actions then feel very very diligent 

00:04:47.020 --> 00:04:50.110
 worked for the team 

00:04:48.850 --> 00:04:51.820
 you just can not forget 

00:04:50.110 --> 00:04:54.610
 only on his actions from the opponent 

00:04:51.820 --> 00:04:56.260
 but what he valued for the 

00:04:54.610 --> 00:04:58.750
 team is very diligent 

00:04:56.260 --> 00:05:00.480
 Nevertheless , the clear ones have to act that way 

00:04:58.750 --> 00:05:02.830
 actions are still missing 

00:05:00.480 --> 00:05:03.520
 flu sick last week that can too 

00:05:02.830 --> 00:05:05.530
 even more 

00:05:03.520 --> 00:05:07.240
 the us economy very neat 

00:05:05.530 --> 00:05:10.500
 one has trained it in the employment so also 

00:05:07.240 --> 00:05:12.370
 played well and i think that has 

00:05:10.500 --> 00:05:14.280
 Today's nomination justifies with 

00:05:12.370 --> 00:05:18.820
 a very good performance and the gates 

00:05:14.280 --> 00:05:22.030
 jannik müller guth was very happy 

00:05:18.820 --> 00:05:24.100
 that we solved that so long 

00:05:22.030 --> 00:05:26.350
 tinkered in the last days 

00:05:24.100 --> 00:05:27.800
 have played through different times 

00:05:26.350 --> 00:05:30.139
 now 11 

00:05:27.800 --> 00:05:33.220
 triggers on the position and so he can 

00:05:30.139 --> 00:05:33.220
 keep going that made me very happy
