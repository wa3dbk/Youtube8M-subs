just<00:05:25.330> keep<00:05:26.330> working<00:05:26.840> it<00:05:26.900> you<00:05:26.960> can<00:05:27.230> see<00:05:27.350> the

00:05:27.870 --> 00:05:27.880 
just keep working it you can see the

00:05:27.880 --> 00:05:29.920 
just keep working it you can see the
compound<00:05:28.880> it's<00:05:29.000> getting<00:05:29.240> a<00:05:29.270> little<00:05:29.360> dark<00:05:29.510> on

compound it's getting a little dark on
this<00:05:30.020> drop<00:05:30.350> it's<00:05:30.710> because<00:05:30.950> it's<00:05:31.100> picking<00:05:31.280> up<00:05:31.460> a

00:05:43.900 --> 00:05:43.910 
here's a wider sweep and this one you

00:05:43.910 --> 00:05:48.040 
here's a wider sweep and this one you
don't<00:05:44.030> really<00:05:44.210> need<00:05:44.540> to<00:05:45.820> go<00:05:46.820> down<00:05:47.690> and<00:05:47.900> back

00:05:48.040 --> 00:05:48.050 
don't really need to go down and back

00:05:48.050 --> 00:05:49.540 
don't really need to go down and back
you<00:05:48.320> can<00:05:48.470> just<00:05:48.590> go<00:05:48.680> all<00:05:48.770> the<00:05:48.890> way<00:05:48.920> across<00:05:49.130> it<00:05:49.490> in

00:05:49.540 --> 00:05:49.550 
you can just go all the way across it in

00:05:49.550 --> 00:05:55.270 
you can just go all the way across it in
