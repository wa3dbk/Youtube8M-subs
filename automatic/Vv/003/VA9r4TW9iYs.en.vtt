we're<00:04:26.980> talking<00:04:27.460> about<00:04:27.520> it<00:04:27.760> on<00:04:28.090> the<00:04:28.240> way<00:04:28.330> here<00:04:28.570> I

00:04:28.590 --> 00:04:28.600 
we're talking about it on the way here I

00:04:28.600 --> 00:04:30.420 
we're talking about it on the way here I
was<00:04:28.750> just<00:04:28.840> doing<00:04:28.990> some<00:04:29.290> research<00:04:29.470> because<00:04:30.130> I

00:04:30.420 --> 00:04:30.430 
was just doing some research because I

00:04:30.430 --> 00:04:32.400 
was just doing some research because I
think<00:04:30.820> it'd<00:04:31.030> be<00:04:31.060> cool<00:04:31.360> to<00:04:31.420> do<00:04:31.660> another<00:04:31.870> show<00:04:32.110> I

00:04:32.400 --> 00:04:32.410 
think it'd be cool to do another show I

00:04:32.410 --> 00:04:34.740 
think it'd be cool to do another show I
mean<00:04:32.560> since<00:04:33.250> it<00:04:33.460> is<00:04:33.700> where<00:04:34.090> we<00:04:34.210> got<00:04:34.330> our<00:04:34.360> start

00:04:34.740 --> 00:04:34.750 
mean since it is where we got our start

00:04:34.750 --> 00:04:38.130 
mean since it is where we got our start
the<00:04:35.710> new<00:04:35.860> california<00:04:36.550> theatre<00:04:36.700> but<00:04:37.330> it's<00:04:38.020> like

00:04:38.130 --> 00:04:38.140 
the new california theatre but it's like

00:04:38.140 --> 00:04:40.080 
the new california theatre but it's like
1100<00:04:38.770> cedar<00:04:39.070> and<00:04:39.190> i<00:04:39.280> think<00:04:39.460> that's<00:04:39.610> doable<00:04:39.850> for

00:04:40.080 --> 00:04:40.090 
1100 cedar and i think that's doable for

00:04:40.090 --> 00:04:42.060 
1100 cedar and i think that's doable for
us<00:04:40.390> now<00:04:40.570> I<00:04:40.600> mean<00:04:40.870> it's<00:04:41.050> a<00:04:41.260> beautiful<00:04:41.740> theater

00:04:42.060 --> 00:04:42.070 
us now I mean it's a beautiful theater

00:04:42.070 --> 00:04:44.160 
us now I mean it's a beautiful theater
and<00:04:42.580> it<00:04:42.730> just<00:04:42.970> depends<00:04:43.360> on<00:04:43.420> if<00:04:43.480> it<00:04:43.720> be<00:04:43.840> going<00:04:44.050> to

00:04:44.160 --> 00:04:44.170 
and it just depends on if it be going to

00:04:44.170 --> 00:04:46.740 
and it just depends on if it be going to
put<00:04:44.380> us<00:04:45.370> there<00:04:45.640> you<00:04:46.180> know<00:04:46.300> but<00:04:46.450> I<00:04:46.480> think<00:04:46.660> it

00:04:46.740 --> 00:04:46.750 
put us there you know but I think it

00:04:46.750 --> 00:04:52.140 
put us there you know but I think it
really<00:04:46.780> cool<00:04:49.470> true<00:04:50.470> leadership<00:04:51.340> yeah<00:04:51.850> for

00:04:52.140 --> 00:04:52.150 
really cool true leadership yeah for

00:04:52.150 --> 00:04:53.940 
really cool true leadership yeah for
sure<00:04:52.180> there's<00:04:52.750> really<00:04:52.930> been<00:04:53.140> a<00:04:53.200> lack<00:04:53.440> of<00:04:53.470> the

00:04:53.940 --> 00:04:53.950 
sure there's really been a lack of the
