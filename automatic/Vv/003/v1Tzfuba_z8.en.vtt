00:00:20.020 --> 00:00:25.250
 first of all famillathlon as the name 

00:00:22.610 --> 00:00:28.009
 the indicated is the manifestation for the 

00:00:25.250 --> 00:00:29.630
 family so the idea is that the 

00:00:28.009 --> 00:00:31.279
 children come with their parents and 

00:00:29.630 --> 00:00:33.350
 can participate in all 

00:00:31.279 --> 00:00:36.320
 proposed activities if many 

00:00:33.350 --> 00:00:38.269
 among those he presents himself tennis 

00:00:36.320 --> 00:00:39.739
 so in the stables of 

00:00:38.269 --> 00:00:43.220
 sponsors are present in cornilleau 

00:00:39.739 --> 00:00:44.750
 tingaud tunes who sponsors universes 

00:00:43.220 --> 00:00:46.790
 so the principle of this manifestation 

00:00:44.750 --> 00:00:49.399
 it's to have four different universes 

00:00:46.790 --> 00:00:50.750
 a universe a little free ping so this 

00:00:49.399 --> 00:00:53.120
 that we could not just be sponsored by 

00:00:50.750 --> 00:00:55.100
 by arte 1 go where we will see tables 

00:00:53.120 --> 00:00:57.590
 with different shapes a practice 

00:00:55.100 --> 00:01:00.110
 a little different a little leisure a 

00:00:57.590 --> 00:01:02.270
 ping technical universe where we will be 

00:01:00.110 --> 00:01:03.320
 more about the dosage on putting the effect 

00:01:02.270 --> 00:01:06.020
 on target targets 

00:01:03.320 --> 00:01:07.729
 a baby ping workshop so there reserved 

00:01:06.020 --> 00:01:10.369
 as the name indicated to children of 4 

00:01:07.729 --> 00:01:12.320
 at 7 with a game on mini 

00:01:10.369 --> 00:01:16.460
 table with courses also off table 

00:01:12.320 --> 00:01:19.580
 and finally was the fid pinto nick so who 

00:01:16.460 --> 00:01:21.659
 is the tn type you and women 

00:01:19.580 --> 00:01:24.359
 so here with 

00:01:21.659 --> 00:01:26.039
 tables of technical workshops too 

00:01:24.359 --> 00:01:29.100
 since women love the technique 

00:01:26.039 --> 00:01:31.049
 is also off laptops with 

00:01:29.100 --> 00:01:32.939
 steppes of the big balloons of the little ones 

00:01:31.049 --> 00:01:34.740
 course still denied to the 

00:01:32.939 --> 00:01:36.000
 practice table tennis activities 

00:01:34.740 --> 00:01:37.920
 table tennis it's very nice 

00:01:36.000 --> 00:01:39.959
 it's friendly we have time to 

00:01:37.920 --> 00:01:42.209
 enjoy a little bit all the time is 

00:01:39.959 --> 00:01:43.130
 Clement everything is fine all 

00:01:42.209 --> 00:01:45.959
 activities are varied 

00:01:43.130 --> 00:01:48.299
 so it's family children 

00:01:45.959 --> 00:01:51.240
 have fun playing with them make sure 

00:01:48.299 --> 00:01:52.859
 the crisis the good people they do not go out 

00:01:51.240 --> 00:01:54.719
 they do not have a way out 

00:01:52.859 --> 00:01:57.780
 day like today's it's 

00:01:54.719 --> 00:02:02.099
 super nice for families here and 

00:01:57.780 --> 00:02:04.280
 to find yourself a little forget the 

00:02:02.099 --> 00:02:04.280
 rest 

00:02:14.790 --> 00:02:18.550
 the operation first is wonderful 

00:02:16.780 --> 00:02:19.990
 to be having sports audits and 

00:02:18.550 --> 00:02:21.760
 states especially under the eiffel tower 

00:02:19.990 --> 00:02:23.260
 so that's the first thing I see 

00:02:21.760 --> 00:02:25.210
 in addition that there are many people 

00:02:23.260 --> 00:02:27.250
 since this morning for not having and the 

00:02:25.210 --> 00:02:29.440
 animators you have more for us it's 

00:02:27.250 --> 00:02:30.310
 a very good opportunity since in 

00:02:29.440 --> 00:02:31.420
 a few months we will have them 

00:02:30.310 --> 00:02:33.670
 world championships we will have a 

00:02:31.420 --> 00:02:34.780
 caravan of table tennis and I 

00:02:33.670 --> 00:02:36.610
 begins a very good rehearsal 

00:02:34.780 --> 00:02:39.100
 the world champion our goal 

00:02:36.610 --> 00:02:40.480
 it is to present the art the ping 

00:02:39.100 --> 00:02:42.250
 all the practitioners not 

00:02:40.480 --> 00:02:43.930
 only obviously for 200 me 

00:02:42.250 --> 00:02:45.520
 fire your 5 million practitioners 

00:02:43.930 --> 00:02:47.560
 I believe that table tennis is 

00:02:45.520 --> 00:02:48.970
 actually developing if we are able 

00:02:47.560 --> 00:02:49.990
 to integrate all the practices 

00:02:48.970 --> 00:02:52.030
 so that's an opportunity 

00:02:49.990 --> 00:02:53.950
 extraordinary to show that at any age 

00:02:52.030 --> 00:02:54.610
 in a different way we can play 

00:02:53.950 --> 00:02:56.260
 Table tennis 

00:02:54.610 --> 00:02:58.300
 so if the promotion for the whole thing for 

00:02:56.260 --> 00:02:59.890
 table tennis generally and for 

00:02:58.300 --> 00:03:01.390
 the federation especially for the 

00:02:59.890 --> 00:03:03.370
 league because I think it's okay 

00:03:01.390 --> 00:03:05.110
 still bring more jeans 

00:03:03.370 --> 00:03:06.670
 ping and when they see that we 

00:03:05.110 --> 00:03:08.490
 will recommence world champions sees 

00:03:06.670 --> 00:03:12.220
 that it will create a real craze 

00:03:08.490 --> 00:03:13.360
 it's been 25 years since we had 

00:03:12.220 --> 00:03:15.340
 objective of increasing which one 

00:03:13.360 --> 00:03:16.510
 essential of 100000 we can not get there 

00:03:15.340 --> 00:03:18.640
 So we come back with the practice 

00:03:16.510 --> 00:03:20.140
 traditional we can not do it 

00:03:18.640 --> 00:03:22.930
 knows that the number of tables sold 

00:03:20.140 --> 00:03:24.910
 increased in permanent increase of which 

00:03:22.930 --> 00:03:27.400
 there is camping recreation there is a ping all 

00:03:24.910 --> 00:03:29.650
 the world is playing and the people who are going to be 

00:03:27.400 --> 00:03:31.060
 created the hobby pigment of tomorrow they 

00:03:29.650 --> 00:03:32.200
 compete for a few 

00:03:31.060 --> 00:03:33.100
 and other ports but it's still 

00:03:32.200 --> 00:03:35.890
 the same activity 

00:03:33.100 --> 00:03:38.460
 a racket ball a table what 

00:03:35.890 --> 00:03:38.460
 whatever the form 

00:03:39.060 --> 00:03:41.750
 It's okay 

00:03:46.170 --> 00:03:49.340
 here we go 

00:03:51.350 --> 00:03:54.340
 here 

00:03:54.470 --> 00:03:59.480
 very well we continue and continue 

00:03:56.710 --> 00:04:00.710
 so here we are in the universe 

00:03:59.480 --> 00:04:04.580
 baby ping 

00:04:00.710 --> 00:04:07.520
 so we target children roughly 

00:04:04.580 --> 00:04:08.930
 4 to 7 years later there is also a 

00:04:07.520 --> 00:04:11.450
 little more we have several workshops 

00:04:08.930 --> 00:04:14.600
 little fun workshops then by 

00:04:11.450 --> 00:04:16.070
 example we have the market where children 

00:04:14.600 --> 00:04:18.620
 we will buy bananas strawberries 

00:04:16.070 --> 00:04:21.560
 or salads we have the gardener 

00:04:18.620 --> 00:04:22.670
 we juggle we have the waiter 

00:04:21.560 --> 00:04:24.260
 where you have to be careful not to 

00:04:22.670 --> 00:04:26.630
 drop the racket ball 

00:04:24.260 --> 00:04:28.940
 here are different workshops with small 

00:04:26.630 --> 00:04:30.380
 equipment balls bullet 

00:04:28.940 --> 00:04:32.630
 different sizes of different 

00:04:30.380 --> 00:04:35.690
 colors in a universe of very blow 

00:04:32.630 --> 00:04:38.810
 playful for it to be at the tab at 

00:04:35.690 --> 00:04:40.580
 portable is theirs comfortable if it's 

00:04:38.810 --> 00:04:42.530
 well framed where it is well brought in 

00:04:40.580 --> 00:04:45.490
 anyway we are far from the image of 

00:04:42.530 --> 00:04:49.120
 table tennis competition 

00:04:45.490 --> 00:04:49.120
 pedagogically very interesting 

00:04:58.430 --> 00:05:02.240
 no 

00:05:00.280 --> 00:05:05.020
 I do not speak much but all 

00:05:02.240 --> 00:05:05.020
 my balls are on the table 

00:05:14.480 --> 00:05:18.930
 the goal every time you touch a 

00:05:17.010 --> 00:05:21.900
 target i'm going to place a white round 

00:05:18.930 --> 00:05:25.130
 okay the goal being to make me either 

00:05:21.900 --> 00:05:25.130
 united sonia gonal 

00:05:26.440 --> 00:05:30.990
 well 

00:05:28.630 --> 00:05:30.990
 hop there 

00:05:34.580 --> 00:05:36.699
 no 

00:05:36.750 --> 00:05:40.139
 go a little effort 

00:05:40.689 --> 00:05:48.249
 you've already targeted this one this workshop 

00:05:46.569 --> 00:05:50.799
 which is called the tonic feeling 

00:05:48.249 --> 00:05:52.929
 we are going to give priority to women 

00:05:50.799 --> 00:05:55.059
 of any age be it baby 

00:05:52.929 --> 00:05:56.649
 little girl or the farms of 60 70 years 

00:05:55.059 --> 00:05:58.419
 with workshops we go a lot 

00:05:56.649 --> 00:06:00.879
 work proprioception the 

00:05:58.419 --> 00:06:03.549
 bodybuilding and the use of sound 

00:06:00.879 --> 00:06:04.929
 body we do not close to men so we 

00:06:03.549 --> 00:06:06.309
 has a lot of boys who finally they 

00:06:04.929 --> 00:06:08.110
 also come to realize that 

00:06:06.309 --> 00:06:10.569
 work with the medicine ball with 

00:06:08.110 --> 00:06:14.050
 balloons physiotherapist or cushions 

00:06:10.569 --> 00:06:15.429
 proprioception is fun and so the 

00:06:14.050 --> 00:06:18.059
 we try to make a whole journey 

00:06:15.429 --> 00:06:20.199
 by doing work and the 

00:06:18.059 --> 00:06:24.429
 proprioception to start the 

00:06:20.199 --> 00:06:26.439
 bodybuilding the feeling of balanced 

00:06:24.429 --> 00:06:28.749
 and moving we go mostly 

00:06:26.439 --> 00:06:31.239
 working with juggling we're going 

00:06:28.749 --> 00:06:33.129
 change your foot every moment you 

00:06:31.239 --> 00:06:36.550
 advance so we're going to have hoops 

00:06:33.129 --> 00:06:37.959
 approach we can facilitate the workshop in 

00:06:36.550 --> 00:06:39.399
 taking one or two rackets doing 

00:06:37.959 --> 00:06:41.379
 bounce the ball by bouncing the ball 

00:06:39.399 --> 00:06:43.749
 is actually this course takes us on 

00:06:41.379 --> 00:06:45.789
 a table we go we have big cushions 

00:06:43.749 --> 00:06:47.050
 inflatable so physio cushions that 

00:06:45.789 --> 00:06:48.849
 are used to strengthen the back and 

00:06:47.050 --> 00:06:52.779
 abdominals but we will play auto with 

00:06:48.849 --> 00:06:54.339
 around the table with this balloon and 

00:06:52.779 --> 00:06:56.499
 unconsciously in fact we often go 

00:06:54.339 --> 00:06:58.569
 you come to muscle and lumbar and 

00:06:56.499 --> 00:07:00.129
 the abdominals playing without getting 

00:06:58.569 --> 00:07:01.599
 account and laughing and 

00:07:00.129 --> 00:07:02.559
 ultimately even people who know 

00:07:01.599 --> 00:07:04.029
 to play realize and it's not 

00:07:02.559 --> 00:07:05.289
 obviously obvious to play on a ball 

00:07:04.029 --> 00:07:07.569
 we discover a practice of tennis 

00:07:05.289 --> 00:07:08.979
 different table and it allows 

00:07:07.569 --> 00:07:11.969
 people who are not necessarily strong of 

00:07:08.979 --> 00:07:11.969
 power on sailboats very well 

00:07:15.890 --> 00:07:18.890
 m 

00:07:21.280 --> 00:07:25.710
 such 

00:07:23.080 --> 00:07:25.710
 alpha 

00:07:33.770 --> 00:07:35.830
 m
