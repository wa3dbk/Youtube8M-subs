00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.920
 and good all those comments 

00:00:02.520 --> 00:00:06.390
 I bring far cry 4 gameplay and as I already 

00:00:04.920 --> 00:00:07.649
 I told you a few days ago a 

00:00:06.390 --> 00:00:09.269
 opportunity to play here and 4 already 

00:00:07.649 --> 00:00:10.740
 practically what has been the 

00:00:09.269 --> 00:00:12.090
 Open world with a lot of things 

00:00:10.740 --> 00:00:14.099
 etcetera you already know that what can 

00:00:12.090 --> 00:00:16.440
 play so much on the e3 that it brought you a 

00:00:14.099 --> 00:00:17.760
 video in both the gamescom also 

00:00:16.440 --> 00:00:19.500
 they were simply missions that 

00:00:17.760 --> 00:00:20.789
 they were simply closed and the 

00:00:19.500 --> 00:00:23.580
 I will leave that environment however 

00:00:20.789 --> 00:00:24.779
 here this is already the gameplay let's say 

00:00:23.580 --> 00:00:27.449
 very similar to what we are going to have 

00:00:24.779 --> 00:00:29.519
 we in buy the game go to 

00:00:27.449 --> 00:00:30.779
 open world and that technique passed here 

00:00:29.519 --> 00:00:31.980
 you are going to see what they are testing of said 

00:00:30.779 --> 00:00:33.180
 a lot to give us that there were these 

00:00:31.980 --> 00:00:35.730
 mines is also you will know here lame 

00:00:33.180 --> 00:00:37.230
 for triple low and killed all those who 

00:00:35.730 --> 00:00:38.700
 there was out there and you're going to see let's say 

00:00:37.230 --> 00:00:40.829
 different pieces you play during 

00:00:38.700 --> 00:00:42.660
 practically long enough almost two 

00:00:40.829 --> 00:00:44.100
 hours and I can try a lot of 

00:00:42.660 --> 00:00:46.020
 things but hey you should put a little 

00:00:44.100 --> 00:00:47.879
 which it is what I liked what I 

00:00:46.020 --> 00:00:50.010
 it seemed etcetera what I can say is that 

00:00:47.879 --> 00:00:51.539
 there are a lot of weapons on everything 

00:00:50.010 --> 00:00:52.890
 love the new animals you know 

00:00:51.539 --> 00:00:54.930
 than me in this game that was cool 

00:00:52.890 --> 00:00:56.730
 it was both the water zone to be able 

00:00:54.930 --> 00:00:58.920
 pull development of cataracts 

00:00:56.730 --> 00:01:00.329
 while the cliffs with the wing 

00:00:58.920 --> 00:01:02.399
 delta etcetera that is also here 

00:01:00.329 --> 00:01:03.390
 in addition to other vehicles and others 

00:01:02.399 --> 00:01:04.739
 It has also improved in enough 

00:01:03.390 --> 00:01:06.420
 aspects about everything we also have 

00:01:04.739 --> 00:01:08.640
 thrown knives 

00:01:06.420 --> 00:01:10.830
 in the whole back let's say we have 

00:01:08.640 --> 00:01:13.259
 a lot of things and good I'm still 

00:01:10.830 --> 00:01:14.759
 just as bad driving or going to see and 

00:01:13.259 --> 00:01:16.229
 I wanted to comment as I said 

00:01:14.759 --> 00:01:18.420
 enough things according to no doubt going to be 

00:01:16.229 --> 00:01:20.070
 one of the games that I wanted the most was 

00:01:18.420 --> 00:01:21.479
 colorful love is like 

00:01:20.070 --> 00:01:22.799
 that there was in fra credit 3 that what more 

00:01:21.479 --> 00:01:24.450
 I was struck by the theme of the 

00:01:22.799 --> 00:01:27.030
 water as I told you it was all as well as 

00:01:24.450 --> 00:01:28.259
 very green cited and in a pass well here 

00:01:27.030 --> 00:01:30.780
 same as what with the theme of 

00:01:28.259 --> 00:01:32.070
 mountains and everything else is crazy 

00:01:30.780 --> 00:01:33.450
 right here you see mind there are even 

00:01:32.070 --> 00:01:36.090
 different as propaganda posters 

00:01:33.450 --> 00:01:37.740
 that you can keep removing the ejido 

00:01:36.090 --> 00:01:39.960
 steal ganda and you have to we wanted that 

00:01:37.740 --> 00:01:42.270
 a kind of trophy will obviously be 

00:01:39.960 --> 00:01:43.409
 get to remove all there are things like 

00:01:42.270 --> 00:01:45.539
 to climb 

00:01:43.409 --> 00:01:47.429
 but start to say that areas 

00:01:45.539 --> 00:01:48.690
 to be able to climb in a balloon and as 

00:01:47.429 --> 00:01:51.569
 add some other previous video 

00:01:48.690 --> 00:01:52.500
 to leave serious then I could choose and from 

00:01:51.569 --> 00:01:53.909
 one area to another on the map because 

00:01:52.500 --> 00:01:56.310
 obviously it can be the mountains and 

00:01:53.909 --> 00:01:58.170
 it is not the same as to go let's say what 

00:01:56.310 --> 00:01:59.610
 kind of helicopter in which I that 

00:01:58.170 --> 00:02:01.500
 keep climbing etc. that becomes a 

00:01:59.610 --> 00:02:03.179
 much heavier then play well 

00:02:01.500 --> 00:02:04.860
 also as it had been commented we have 

00:02:03.179 --> 00:02:06.959
 the theme of the animals that influenced 

00:02:04.860 --> 00:02:08.819
 let's say in the way we were going 

00:02:06.959 --> 00:02:10.649
 to kill for example you already know that yes 

00:02:08.819 --> 00:02:12.060
 shot at any animal because the 

00:02:10.649 --> 00:02:14.159
 skin will be affected then we will 

00:02:12.060 --> 00:02:16.409
 give less pieces of skin that then we go 

00:02:14.159 --> 00:02:18.420
 to need to create different things 

00:02:16.409 --> 00:02:19.859
 and be able to use it as for backpacks and 

00:02:18.420 --> 00:02:21.209
 other little things here however if 

00:02:19.859 --> 00:02:23.909
 We put someone to be on the verge of 

00:02:21.209 --> 00:02:27.750
 kill me on a fox panda or not 

00:02:23.909 --> 00:02:30.299
 I know what I say, not because some dogs and the 

00:02:27.750 --> 00:02:31.920
 amazing let's say the damage that 

00:02:30.299 --> 00:02:33.359
 they care for many animals that you steal from me 

00:02:31.920 --> 00:02:35.250
 wait how they see once that as of 

00:02:33.359 --> 00:02:37.709
 mouse or skunk that I found that 

00:02:35.250 --> 00:02:38.280
 imposed the put me fine but good as 

00:02:37.709 --> 00:02:40.079
 this 

00:02:38.280 --> 00:02:41.579
 has some things on all the subject of 

00:02:40.079 --> 00:02:44.400
 interact with the environment and 

00:02:41.579 --> 00:02:46.379
 other environment we could say is a 

00:02:44.400 --> 00:02:48.090
 last and good as well as many already 

00:02:46.379 --> 00:02:50.099
 you know if you have seen by twitter and 

00:02:48.090 --> 00:02:51.930
 during the videos and things that we did 

00:02:50.099 --> 00:02:54.180
 happening a couple of weeks ago we were 

00:02:51.930 --> 00:02:56.250
 a month ago several youtubers in the middle of 

00:02:54.180 --> 00:02:58.799
 the nature that we had never 

00:02:56.250 --> 00:03:01.049
 seen there full of bugs and spiders and 

00:02:58.799 --> 00:03:02.340
 things that I hate a lot but it was 

00:03:01.049 --> 00:03:04.139
 super fun being able to be 

00:03:02.340 --> 00:03:05.519
 there a lot of friends and we do not 

00:03:04.139 --> 00:03:08.099
 prevents doing crazy things that we never 

00:03:05.519 --> 00:03:09.239
 We saw what I thought of doing and how I continue 

00:03:08.099 --> 00:03:10.769
 You have the link below the 

00:03:09.239 --> 00:03:12.419
 description of the trailer although many 

00:03:10.769 --> 00:03:13.590
 They said that you will have seen it but 

00:03:12.419 --> 00:03:15.630
 for those who do not because you will have here 

00:03:13.590 --> 00:03:17.130
 down and you will see all the follies 

00:03:15.630 --> 00:03:19.410
 during I think there are going to be six 

00:03:17.130 --> 00:03:21.750
 episodes and it's going to be an authentic 

00:03:19.410 --> 00:03:23.580
 last and we had a great time 

00:03:21.750 --> 00:03:25.200
 they let tell nothing even in this 

00:03:23.580 --> 00:03:27.800
 moment and we are dying our tongue 

00:03:25.200 --> 00:03:29.970
 and not everything we had to do and 

00:03:27.800 --> 00:03:31.530
 simply without being able to say good then 

00:03:29.970 --> 00:03:34.740
 we are here 

00:03:31.530 --> 00:03:36.840
 in the middle of the forest wait we hope that 

00:03:34.740 --> 00:03:38.940
 soon logo drive etcetera but yes 

00:03:36.840 --> 00:03:40.410
 it was super good as you can see there is a 

00:03:38.940 --> 00:03:42.600
 bunch up here going back a bit more 

00:03:40.410 --> 00:03:44.010
 to the game that I have loved has 

00:03:42.600 --> 00:03:46.200
 been the theme that missions are 

00:03:44.010 --> 00:03:48.300
 quite different to create three 

00:03:46.200 --> 00:03:49.920
 let's say that more or less then it ends 

00:03:48.300 --> 00:03:51.780
 come a time when I was to take 

00:03:49.920 --> 00:03:52.710
 checkpoints and so on and here I have 

00:03:51.780 --> 00:03:54.540
 seen missions 

00:03:52.710 --> 00:03:55.710
 let's say that the fact of 

00:03:54.540 --> 00:03:58.020
 that the four control points are 

00:03:55.710 --> 00:03:59.190
 quite different also from there 

00:03:58.020 --> 00:04:02.100
 missions in which they have to repair 

00:03:59.190 --> 00:04:03.960
 well wait areas that later 

00:04:02.100 --> 00:04:05.610
 we have to repair areas for example 

00:04:03.960 --> 00:04:07.980
 like a truck is to follow later 

00:04:05.610 --> 00:04:09.780
 with a kind of convoy 

00:04:07.980 --> 00:04:12.090
 crazy about everything also the subject of 

00:04:09.780 --> 00:04:13.530
 weapons there is a pass here you go to 

00:04:12.090 --> 00:04:16.680
 see I'm here just uploaded to me 

00:04:13.530 --> 00:04:18.299
 above what is still the truck 

00:04:16.680 --> 00:04:20.120
 to climb up I had to go with this 

00:04:18.299 --> 00:04:23.010
 convoy and also playing let's say 

00:04:20.120 --> 00:04:24.150
 quite the theme of the allies though 

00:04:23.010 --> 00:04:26.729
 yes you have to keep in mind because 

00:04:24.150 --> 00:04:28.050
 the allies do things and it's just useful 

00:04:26.729 --> 00:04:30.300
 and all since to me at least 

00:04:28.050 --> 00:04:31.320
 they helped quite imminent moments in 

00:04:30.300 --> 00:04:32.400
 the ones that you have to take to them 

00:04:31.320 --> 00:04:35.370
 because maybe as you have seen there 

00:04:32.400 --> 00:04:36.660
 behind them as highlighted foxes dogs 

00:04:35.370 --> 00:04:38.850
 they will attack any other kind of things 

00:04:36.660 --> 00:04:40.530
 and we have been killing all the animals 

00:04:38.850 --> 00:04:42.240
 that I found in the game I tried them 

00:04:40.530 --> 00:04:44.310
 killing some has cost me more others 

00:04:42.240 --> 00:04:47.250
 less an elephant mind a trompazo that 

00:04:44.310 --> 00:04:48.690
 it left me fine towards the one of vido you go to see 

00:04:47.250 --> 00:04:51.409
 how do I get to kill a bear that 

00:04:48.690 --> 00:04:52.939
 it costs almost life 

00:04:51.409 --> 00:04:54.619
 you will see now how the theme was made 

00:04:52.939 --> 00:04:56.539
 of having to repair there was life 

00:04:54.619 --> 00:04:59.119
 of the tractor of the change I had to 

00:04:56.539 --> 00:05:00.679
 bring up here giving after healing or 

00:04:59.119 --> 00:05:03.709
 cover a little to see if I could get 

00:05:00.679 --> 00:05:05.449
 get that meat out of this trouble at 

00:05:03.709 --> 00:05:07.909
 man of the truck is that I repair them there 

00:05:05.449 --> 00:05:10.099
 is and we go up again to follow 

00:05:07.909 --> 00:05:12.649
 our our course as I tell you a 

00:05:10.099 --> 00:05:15.080
 heaps and heaps of explosions and 

00:05:12.649 --> 00:05:16.519
 things that surely, as I go out 

00:05:15.080 --> 00:05:19.369
 game I think it's practically in a 

00:05:16.519 --> 00:05:21.979
 month when it comes out if I 'm not wrong and 14 

00:05:19.369 --> 00:05:23.929
 just in a month after we say 

00:05:21.979 --> 00:05:26.089
 than what I'm seeing in the video or 

00:05:23.929 --> 00:05:28.399
 is that he has to paint put in addition 

00:05:26.089 --> 00:05:31.009
 as a hundred is a bunch of weapons and 

00:05:28.399 --> 00:05:32.479
 I definitely think he spends something and I 

00:05:31.009 --> 00:05:34.459
 love the fact that there are games like this 

00:05:32.479 --> 00:05:35.569
 with open world without seeing are those that 

00:05:34.459 --> 00:05:37.909
 I like it more because in the end what 

00:05:35.569 --> 00:05:41.839
 he ended up doing this tube - the campaign and 

00:05:37.909 --> 00:05:44.059
 going like my ball when we say 

00:05:41.839 --> 00:05:46.009
 there's a lot about everything I do not know why 

00:05:44.059 --> 00:05:47.689
 I want to kill animals I do not 

00:05:46.009 --> 00:05:49.699
 ask because with what I like 

00:05:47.689 --> 00:05:51.860
 but there are a lot there are monkeys there are also 

00:05:49.699 --> 00:05:53.659
 monkeys in the game louis enchanted that 

00:05:51.860 --> 00:05:57.829
 could have as pets but not 

00:05:53.659 --> 00:05:58.249
 they can take an adventure with you 

00:05:57.829 --> 00:06:00.319
 monkey 

00:05:58.249 --> 00:06:02.719
 on the shoulder in love plan to be reading 

00:06:00.319 --> 00:06:05.839
 kill peanuts is the monkey is made 

00:06:02.719 --> 00:06:07.309
 Friend of yours or the hand I love the 

00:06:05.839 --> 00:06:08.749
 true here is the helicopter that you 

00:06:07.309 --> 00:06:11.419
 I commented also what I put during 

00:06:08.749 --> 00:06:14.629
 during the video I tell you the game 

00:06:11.419 --> 00:06:16.309
 says he tried to kill here let's say I 

00:06:14.629 --> 00:06:18.709
 has toy has a kind of 4 a 

00:06:16.309 --> 00:06:20.289
 you almost see that they start to like me 

00:06:18.709 --> 00:06:23.779
 life and I say but they are burning 

00:06:20.289 --> 00:06:25.939
 are burning hot see the little dots and 

00:06:23.779 --> 00:06:27.529
 I piro but yes how is the day is super 

00:06:25.939 --> 00:06:28.759
 useful the helicopter theme because as 

00:06:27.529 --> 00:06:30.199
 you see all the zones are like very 

00:06:28.759 --> 00:06:32.569
 There are areas where the best of 

00:06:30.199 --> 00:06:33.799
 It would take 15 minutes to get there if 

00:06:32.569 --> 00:06:35.899
 you had to drive or walk 

00:06:33.799 --> 00:06:38.209
 just to go for the cliffs 

00:06:35.899 --> 00:06:40.279
 and so on and that way 

00:06:38.209 --> 00:06:42.019
 how much 30 seconds to arrive from an area 

00:06:40.279 --> 00:06:43.339
 to another one that is yes that is say that 

00:06:42.019 --> 00:06:45.259
 I would have made them put 

00:06:43.339 --> 00:06:47.659
 different means of transport for 

00:06:45.259 --> 00:06:49.069
 deal much less in one end to another 

00:06:47.659 --> 00:06:51.129
 to be careful because it is very easy to 

00:06:49.069 --> 00:06:53.449
 I want you to fall 

00:06:51.129 --> 00:06:55.579
 drive it badly so that you do not 

00:06:53.449 --> 00:06:57.019
 worry because it is complicated and 

00:06:55.579 --> 00:06:58.489
 surely in the videos you will see that I'm going 

00:06:57.019 --> 00:07:00.319
 to fall a thousand times from the helicopter because 

00:06:58.489 --> 00:07:02.029
 here I did it only that I did not put it for 

00:07:00.319 --> 00:07:03.760
 that you think I was good and everything 

00:07:02.029 --> 00:07:05.740
 that here 

00:07:03.760 --> 00:07:08.410
 as an attempt to go see what's here 

00:07:05.740 --> 00:07:09.430
 because I knew there was a bear and I say to 

00:07:08.410 --> 00:07:12.520
 see this is going to be the time obviously 

00:07:09.430 --> 00:07:14.620
 and patricia no no no to shotguns I say 

00:07:12.520 --> 00:07:16.720
 well do not attack me take one in the head 

00:07:14.620 --> 00:07:19.480
 do not die another but you have but 

00:07:16.720 --> 00:07:22.060
 proposes a low wall nothing nothing beltré 

00:07:19.480 --> 00:07:24.430
 escopetazos I took the lead I have and 

00:07:22.060 --> 00:07:26.190
 seen what it will take so I do not expect anything 

00:07:24.430 --> 00:07:28.120
 that you liked this video 

00:07:26.190 --> 00:07:30.310
 you will surely have more park videos 

00:07:28.120 --> 00:07:32.800
 let's say they try when it comes out or 

00:07:30.310 --> 00:07:34.150
 maybe I'll upload something more than what I recorded and 

00:07:32.800 --> 00:07:35.470
 as if you like video garcía that 

00:07:34.150 --> 00:07:37.240
 you can have some games the video of the 

00:07:35.470 --> 00:07:41.130
 description and see you in the next
