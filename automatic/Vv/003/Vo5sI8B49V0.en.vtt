I you know I kind of give it a six point
five<00:01:41.799> out<00:01:42.009> of<00:01:42.070> ten<00:01:42.399> it<00:01:42.820> was<00:01:43.000> an<00:01:43.090> OK<00:01:43.360> film<00:01:43.659> it<00:01:43.810> was

00:01:43.859 --> 00:01:43.869 
five out of ten it was an OK film it was

00:01:43.869 --> 00:01:45.899 
five out of ten it was an OK film it was
a<00:01:43.960> popcorn<00:01:44.229> science<00:01:45.100> fictional<00:01:45.430> month<00:01:45.670> film

00:01:45.899 --> 00:01:45.909 
a popcorn science fictional month film

00:01:45.909 --> 00:01:48.870 
a popcorn science fictional month film
probably<00:01:46.840> that<00:01:47.710> I<00:01:47.740> had<00:01:48.100> it's<00:01:48.310> just<00:01:48.579> there<00:01:48.820> was

00:01:48.870 --> 00:01:48.880 
probably that I had it's just there was

00:01:48.880 --> 00:01:51.569 
probably that I had it's just there was
just<00:01:49.090> a<00:01:49.210> lot<00:01:49.479> of<00:01:49.770> empty<00:01:50.770> holes<00:01:51.009> in<00:01:51.250> the<00:01:51.340> film

00:01:51.569 --> 00:01:51.579 
just a lot of empty holes in the film

00:01:51.579 --> 00:01:54.380 
just a lot of empty holes in the film
that<00:01:51.909> the<00:01:52.420> writers<00:01:52.810> felt<00:01:53.079> the<00:01:53.439> attention<00:01:54.100> and

00:01:54.380 --> 00:01:54.390 
that the writers felt the attention and

00:01:54.390 --> 00:01:57.450 
that the writers felt the attention and
ultimately<00:01:55.390> I<00:01:56.200> think<00:01:56.890> this<00:01:57.280> particular

00:01:57.450 --> 00:01:57.460 
ultimately I think this particular

00:01:57.460 --> 00:02:00.059 
ultimately I think this particular
figure<00:01:57.970> is<00:01:58.090> going<00:01:58.270> to<00:01:58.329> suffer<00:01:58.539> because<00:01:58.920> we<00:01:59.920> as

00:02:00.059 --> 00:02:00.069 
figure is going to suffer because we as
