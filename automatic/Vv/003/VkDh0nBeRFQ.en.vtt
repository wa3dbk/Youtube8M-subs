lens the passive infrared sensor and the
IR<00:00:56.850> light<00:00:57.090> now<00:00:58.020> the<00:00:58.079> passive<00:00:58.649> infrared<00:00:58.920> is

00:00:59.270 --> 00:00:59.280 
IR light now the passive infrared is

00:00:59.280 --> 00:01:00.709 
IR light now the passive infrared is
going<00:00:59.460> to<00:00:59.520> get<00:00:59.640> a<00:00:59.670> truer<00:01:00.000> motion<00:01:00.420> detection

00:01:00.709 --> 00:01:00.719 
going to get a truer motion detection

00:01:00.719 --> 00:01:02.930 
going to get a truer motion detection
versus<00:01:01.260> the<00:01:01.379> pixel<00:01:01.770> based<00:01:01.980> that<00:01:02.640> you<00:01:02.789> normally
