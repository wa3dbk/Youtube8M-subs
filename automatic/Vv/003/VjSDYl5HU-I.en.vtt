any range submachine guns are not good

00:04:23.250 --> 00:04:25.219

against<00:04:23.760> type<00:04:23.909> 95<00:04:24.180> years<00:04:24.539> because<00:04:24.870> they<00:04:24.990> still

00:04:25.219 --> 00:04:25.229 
against type 95 years because they still

00:04:25.229 --> 00:04:26.570 
against type 95 years because they still
have<00:04:25.380> a<00:04:25.409> one-hit<00:04:25.830> kill<00:04:26.010> on<00:04:26.159> you

have a one-hit kill on you

00:04:26.580 --> 00:04:29.270 
have a one-hit kill on you
and<00:04:26.699> it's<00:04:27.509> just<00:04:27.750> way<00:04:28.259> too<00:04:28.319> powerful<00:04:28.650> weapon

00:04:29.270 --> 00:04:29.280 
and it's just way too powerful weapon

00:04:29.280 --> 00:04:31.369 
and it's just way too powerful weapon
there's<00:04:29.430> not<00:04:29.699> enough<00:04:29.909> recoil<00:04:30.360> the<00:04:30.780> fire<00:04:31.199> rate

00:04:31.369 --> 00:04:31.379 
there's not enough recoil the fire rate

00:04:31.379 --> 00:04:32.960 
there's not enough recoil the fire rate
is<00:04:31.470> too<00:04:31.650> fast<00:04:31.680> I<00:04:32.189> don't<00:04:32.400> know<00:04:32.460> exactly<00:04:32.849> but

00:04:32.960 --> 00:04:32.970 
is too fast I don't know exactly but

00:04:32.970 --> 00:04:35.240 
is too fast I don't know exactly but
they<00:04:33.599> need<00:04:33.840> to<00:04:33.870> somehow<00:04:34.229> weaken<00:04:34.710> that<00:04:34.889> weapon

00:04:35.240 --> 00:04:35.250 
they need to somehow weaken that weapon

00:04:35.250 --> 00:04:37.670 
they need to somehow weaken that weapon
because<00:04:35.400> as<00:04:35.610> of<00:04:35.759> now<00:04:35.969> it<00:04:36.180> is<00:04:36.659> it<00:04:37.139> is<00:04:37.319> just<00:04:37.560> too

00:04:37.670 --> 00:04:37.680 
because as of now it is it is just too

00:04:37.680 --> 00:04:40.010 
because as of now it is it is just too
powerful<00:04:37.830> it<00:04:38.219> is<00:04:38.250> unfairly<00:04:39.150> good<00:04:39.479> so

00:04:40.010 --> 00:04:40.020 
powerful it is unfairly good so

00:04:40.020 --> 00:04:42.020 
powerful it is unfairly good so
hopefully<00:04:40.740> they'll<00:04:41.099> patch<00:04:41.250> that<00:04:41.430> as<00:04:41.639> time

00:04:42.020 --> 00:04:42.030 
hopefully they'll patch that as time

00:04:42.030 --> 00:04:43.879 
hopefully they'll patch that as time
goes<00:04:42.210> on<00:04:42.330> maybe<00:04:42.539> they<00:04:42.810> won't<00:04:42.960> who<00:04:43.439> knows<00:04:43.680> but

00:04:43.879 --> 00:04:43.889 
goes on maybe they won't who knows but

00:04:43.889 --> 00:04:45.649 
goes on maybe they won't who knows but
right<00:04:44.069> now<00:04:44.219> in<00:04:44.490> this<00:04:44.639> period<00:04:44.879> of<00:04:45.090> time<00:04:45.270> the

right now in this period of time the

00:04:45.659 --> 00:04:48.950 
right now in this period of time the
type<00:04:45.870> 95<00:04:46.199> is<00:04:46.590> way<00:04:47.039> too<00:04:47.099> powerful<00:04:47.819> and<00:04:48.270> the<00:04:48.780> next

00:04:48.950 --> 00:04:48.960 
type 95 is way too powerful and the next

00:04:48.960 --> 00:04:50.450 
type 95 is way too powerful and the next
major<00:04:49.169> issue<00:04:49.439> I<00:04:49.560> wanted<00:04:49.830> to<00:04:49.889> talk<00:04:50.069> about<00:04:50.099> is

00:04:50.450 --> 00:04:50.460 
major issue I wanted to talk about is

00:04:50.460 --> 00:04:51.860 
major issue I wanted to talk about is

death streak so if you think about it

00:04:51.870 --> 00:04:54.499 
death streak so if you think about it

them and you should have killed them or

them and you should have killed them or
in<00:05:22.680> fact<00:05:22.949> if<00:05:23.190> you<00:05:23.219> killed<00:05:23.550> them<00:05:23.639> six<00:05:23.879> times<00:05:24.120> and

in fact if you killed them six times and
they<00:05:24.360> had<00:05:24.479> dead<00:05:24.689> man's<00:05:24.900> hand<00:05:25.110> on<00:05:25.319> they

00:05:29.420 --> 00:05:29.430 
though they should have died like it

00:05:29.430 --> 00:05:31.129 
though they should have died like it
makes<00:05:29.550> no<00:05:29.789> sense<00:05:29.819> that<00:05:30.180> death<00:05:30.509> streaks<00:05:30.779> on<00:05:30.930> in

00:05:31.129 --> 00:05:31.139

or bad team with death streaks it just

00:05:43.740 --> 00:05:45.050 
or bad team with death streaks it just
doesn't<00:05:44.039> make<00:05:44.099> any<00:05:44.159> sense<00:05:44.430> at<00:05:44.610> all<00:05:44.699> and<00:05:44.940> it's

00:05:45.050 --> 00:05:45.060 
doesn't make any sense at all and it's

00:05:45.060 --> 00:05:47.209 
doesn't make any sense at all and it's
not<00:05:45.270> fair<00:05:45.629> for<00:05:46.139> players<00:05:46.469> that<00:05:46.710> are<00:05:46.770> good<00:05:47.039> to

00:05:51.680 --> 00:05:51.690 
shoot them it just doesn't make any

00:05:51.690 --> 00:05:53.899 
shoot them it just doesn't make any
sense<00:05:52.110> so<00:05:52.680> death<00:05:52.979> streaks<00:05:53.250> honestly<00:05:53.759> should

00:05:53.899 --> 00:05:53.909 
sense so death streaks honestly should

00:05:53.909 --> 00:05:56.029 
sense so death streaks honestly should
have<00:05:54.000> been<00:05:54.120> taken<00:05:54.240> out<00:05:54.539> really<00:05:55.259> the<00:05:55.710> second

cannot consistently do well at all it
just<00:06:54.809> doesn't<00:06:55.019> happen<00:06:55.169> some<00:06:55.829> games<00:06:56.009> you'll<00:06:56.189> do

00:06:56.329 --> 00:06:56.339 
just doesn't happen some games you'll do

just doesn't happen some games you'll do
well<00:06:56.519> sometimes<00:06:57.209> you<00:06:57.299> won't<00:06:57.419> really

00:06:57.769 --> 00:06:57.779 
well sometimes you won't really

00:06:57.779 --> 00:06:59.629 
well sometimes you won't really
depending<00:06:58.319> on<00:06:58.439> how<00:06:58.649> many<00:06:58.799> bars<00:06:59.039> you<00:06:59.219> have<00:06:59.429> and

00:06:59.629 --> 00:06:59.639 
depending on how many bars you have and

00:06:59.639 --> 00:07:01.969 
depending on how many bars you have and
that<00:06:59.759> is<00:06:59.909> the<00:06:59.999> truth<00:07:00.029> we'd<00:07:00.719> hoped<00:07:01.019> after<00:07:01.769> black

00:07:01.969 --> 00:07:01.979 
that is the truth we'd hoped after black

00:07:01.979 --> 00:07:03.739 
that is the truth we'd hoped after black
ops<00:07:02.219> after<00:07:02.519> the<00:07:02.609> catastrophe<00:07:02.759> with

00:07:03.739 --> 00:07:03.749 
ops after the catastrophe with

00:07:03.749 --> 00:07:05.359 
ops after the catastrophe with
connection<00:07:04.229> and<00:07:04.349> black<00:07:04.499> ops<00:07:04.739> they<00:07:04.949> might<00:07:05.129> fix

00:07:05.359 --> 00:07:05.369 
connection and black ops they might fix

00:07:05.369 --> 00:07:06.859 
connection and black ops they might fix
it<00:07:05.579> that<00:07:05.939> they<00:07:06.059> might<00:07:06.209> make<00:07:06.479> hit<00:07:06.719> detection

00:07:06.859 --> 00:07:06.869 
it that they might make hit detection

00:07:06.869 --> 00:07:09.259 
it that they might make hit detection
better<00:07:07.349> that<00:07:07.769> they<00:07:07.860> might<00:07:08.039> make<00:07:08.339> corner<00:07:09.029> dying

00:07:09.259 --> 00:07:09.269 
better that they might make corner dying

00:07:09.269 --> 00:07:11.449 
better that they might make corner dying
and<00:07:09.569> corner<00:07:10.169> lag<00:07:10.379> better<00:07:10.649> but<00:07:11.069> they<00:07:11.159> didn't

00:07:11.449 --> 00:07:11.459 
and corner lag better but they didn't

00:07:11.459 --> 00:07:13.879 
and corner lag better but they didn't
the<00:07:11.939> lag<00:07:12.299> is<00:07:12.479> just<00:07:12.749> as<00:07:12.869> bad<00:07:12.989> as<00:07:13.199> it<00:07:13.319> was<00:07:13.349> a<00:07:13.499> year

00:07:13.879 --> 00:07:13.889 
the lag is just as bad as it was a year

00:07:13.889 --> 00:07:16.069 
the lag is just as bad as it was a year
ago<00:07:14.009> in<00:07:14.339> black<00:07:14.579> ops<00:07:14.789> and<00:07:15.059> I<00:07:15.479> doubt<00:07:15.929> they're

00:07:16.069 --> 00:07:16.079 
ago in black ops and I doubt they're

00:07:16.079 --> 00:07:17.239 
ago in black ops and I doubt they're
going<00:07:16.169> to<00:07:16.259> be<00:07:16.349> able<00:07:16.499> to<00:07:16.559> fix<00:07:16.709> it<00:07:16.860> in<00:07:16.949> this<00:07:17.009> game

00:07:17.239 --> 00:07:17.249 
going to be able to fix it in this game

00:07:17.249 --> 00:07:18.469 
going to be able to fix it in this game
I<00:07:17.429> mean<00:07:17.669> it's<00:07:17.849> just<00:07:17.879> the<00:07:18.089> way<00:07:18.209> the<00:07:18.329> game<00:07:18.360> is

00:07:18.469 --> 00:07:18.479 
I mean it's just the way the game is

00:07:18.479 --> 00:07:21.979 
I mean it's just the way the game is
structured<00:07:19.019> but<00:07:19.559> I<00:07:20.309> don't<00:07:21.089> know<00:07:21.179> I<00:07:21.389> honestly

00:07:21.979 --> 00:07:21.989 
structured but I don't know I honestly

00:07:21.989 --> 00:07:23.449 
structured but I don't know I honestly
hope<00:07:22.139> that<00:07:22.349> they<00:07:22.439> will<00:07:22.589> buy<00:07:22.829> doubt<00:07:23.159> they<00:07:23.309> will

00:07:23.449 --> 00:07:23.459 
hope that they will buy doubt they will

00:07:23.459 --> 00:07:25.369 
hope that they will buy doubt they will
and<00:07:23.699> I<00:07:24.539> don't<00:07:24.929> know<00:07:25.019> if<00:07:25.079> we're<00:07:25.199> ever<00:07:25.289> gonna
