is<00:00:58.109> it<00:00:58.230> let<00:00:58.379> it<00:00:58.500> sit<00:00:58.649> for<00:00:58.680> five<00:00:59.010> minutes<00:00:59.420> it

00:01:00.410 --> 00:01:00.420 
is it let it sit for five minutes it

00:01:00.420 --> 00:01:02.360 
is it let it sit for five minutes it
looks<00:01:00.629> weird<00:01:00.809> it<00:01:01.079> smells<00:01:01.350> even<00:01:01.500> weirder<00:01:01.920> it's

00:01:02.360 --> 00:01:02.370 
looks weird it smells even weirder it's

00:01:02.370 --> 00:01:03.650 
looks weird it smells even weirder it's
kind<00:01:02.489> of<00:01:02.579> taken<00:01:02.969> on<00:01:03.210> like<00:01:03.329> a<00:01:03.420> thicker

00:01:03.650 --> 00:01:03.660 
kind of taken on like a thicker

00:01:03.660 --> 00:01:05.299 
kind of taken on like a thicker
consistency<00:01:03.930> but<00:01:04.619> essentially<00:01:05.040> that's<00:01:05.159> what

00:01:05.299 --> 00:01:05.309 
consistency but essentially that's what

00:01:05.309 --> 00:01:07.070 
consistency but essentially that's what
