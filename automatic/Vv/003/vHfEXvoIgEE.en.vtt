00:00:10.429 --> 00:00:21.510
 here are the marvels of sunflower 

00:00:16.160 --> 00:00:26.150
 the sunflower inside if la la 

00:00:21.510 --> 00:00:30.929
 a knowledge not knowledge 

00:00:26.150 --> 00:00:35.820
 primordial in together you see this 

00:00:30.929 --> 00:00:38.370
 sunflower turns in the direction of the sun 

00:00:35.820 --> 00:00:42.090
 for this it is called sunflower and 

00:00:38.370 --> 00:00:47.480
 they are all shot more or less in the 

00:00:42.090 --> 00:00:51.750
 same towards archaic knowledge 

00:00:47.480 --> 00:00:53.760
 primordial of sunflowers boys 

00:00:51.750 --> 00:00:58.579
 walk in a field of sunflowers there 

00:00:53.760 --> 00:01:00.600
 feels small as if we saw a 

00:00:58.579 --> 00:01:05.359
 flower in bloom 

00:01:00.600 --> 00:01:05.359
 we will be here too 

00:01:09.740 --> 00:01:22.729
 win by yourself that they are all shot by 

00:01:13.670 --> 00:01:26.170
 the right knowledge of the world and how 

00:01:22.729 --> 00:01:30.340
 and like the parable of the Christ who says 

00:01:26.170 --> 00:01:34.360
 that inside a seed there is knowledge 

00:01:30.340 --> 00:01:41.299
 inside a if instead all complain the 

00:01:34.360 --> 00:01:44.360
 the parable the seed and the knowledge there 

00:01:41.299 --> 00:01:48.979
 oak inside yes instead everything 

00:01:44.360 --> 00:01:53.119
 here we are like sunflowers we should 

00:01:48.979 --> 00:01:57.470
 turn our attention to the 

00:01:53.119 --> 00:02:00.830
 our inner sun boys is gorgeous 

00:01:57.470 --> 00:02:05.590
 I don't go into it because not for 

00:02:00.830 --> 00:02:12.480
 ruin the sunflower but you can see 

00:02:05.590 --> 00:02:17.230
 I'm a wonder everyone turned around I know 

00:02:12.480 --> 00:02:22.599
 as they do their intelligence they have 

00:02:17.230 --> 00:02:25.870
 look at an extraordinary intelligence 

00:02:22.599 --> 00:02:32.620
 look how wonderful then i like 

00:02:25.870 --> 00:02:35.280
 sunflowers we should turn to ours 

00:02:32.620 --> 00:02:35.280
 only interior 

00:02:35.290 --> 00:02:42.249
 it's not difficult if a flower does if it does 

00:02:39.280 --> 00:02:45.639
 makes a flower because we shouldn't do it 

00:02:42.249 --> 00:02:50.530
 us because it is that we are less than a 

00:02:45.639 --> 00:02:55.299
 flower and this is the knowledge that 

00:02:50.530 --> 00:02:57.669
 we have forgotten why because we 

00:02:55.299 --> 00:03:01.090
 we have a mind full of 

00:02:57.669 --> 00:03:09.840
 programs for this that we have 

00:03:01.090 --> 00:03:13.359
 forgotten but they are like saying 

00:03:09.840 --> 00:03:17.430
 attempts by the mind of 

00:03:13.359 --> 00:03:22.680
 put ourselves and go even further away 

00:03:17.430 --> 00:03:22.680
 from our inner sun is a program 

00:03:24.389 --> 00:03:32.759
 watch the shooters and remember and a 

00:03:31.000 --> 00:03:40.419
 sunflower to this knowledge 

00:03:32.759 --> 00:03:41.220
 I repeat we are not less well 

00:03:40.419 --> 00:03:44.820
 boys 

00:03:41.220 --> 00:03:48.480
 the stems here are a wonder though 

00:03:44.820 --> 00:03:53.870
 lecce I repeat I feel small I feel 

00:03:48.480 --> 00:03:53.870
 small compared to these giant flowers 

00:03:54.120 --> 00:04:01.160
 the beauty is that from a small seed is born 

00:03:57.410 --> 00:04:06.200
 a huge flower like sunflower 

00:04:01.160 --> 00:04:06.200
 pirates of us there are colors that e2 m 

00:04:07.140 --> 00:04:10.490
 okay not good guys 

00:04:11.319 --> 00:04:18.509
 remember to try to find the 

00:04:15.159 --> 00:04:26.970
 our inner sun as the ride is 

00:04:18.509 --> 00:04:26.970
