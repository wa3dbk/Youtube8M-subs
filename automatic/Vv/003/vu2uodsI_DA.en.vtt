00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.850
 hey people this is the windows phone 8 

00:00:03.449 --> 00:00:07.649
 first with htc and that's what else 

00:00:05.850 --> 00:00:09.630
 In the packaging, they look like this 

00:00:07.649 --> 00:00:12.030
 we already know them from htc 

00:00:09.630 --> 00:00:12.840
 have nothing in there because it is 

00:00:12.030 --> 00:00:15.120
 lying outside 

00:00:12.840 --> 00:00:17.910
 Let's take a look at what's in there 

00:00:15.120 --> 00:00:19.710
 have a lot to read from short instructions 

00:00:17.910 --> 00:00:23.730
 in different languages ​​about one 

00:00:19.710 --> 00:00:26.189
 concrete and safety travel or 

00:00:23.730 --> 00:00:29.490
 Guarantee conditions over such a 

00:00:26.189 --> 00:00:33.540
 windows map with the windows of id for 

00:00:29.490 --> 00:00:35.760
 windows phone os 8 the end small cd 

00:00:33.540 --> 00:00:37.700
 a mini manual so to speak and indeed in 

00:00:35.760 --> 00:00:39.870
 digital form a few stickers and 

00:00:37.700 --> 00:00:42.149
 Of course the usual light is on 

00:00:39.870 --> 00:00:44.219
 Power adapter for the outlet that you 

00:00:42.149 --> 00:00:46.320
 this data half played, of course 

00:00:44.219 --> 00:00:48.090
 with micro-usb connection like that 

00:00:46.320 --> 00:00:51.079
 reasonable manufacturers deal with 

00:00:48.090 --> 00:00:53.010
 not to want to ride on apple 

00:00:51.079 --> 00:00:54.480
 to set together can the 

00:00:53.010 --> 00:00:55.680
 Of course a socket load otherwise 

00:00:54.480 --> 00:00:58.649
 we can hereby also s.pc or 

00:00:55.680 --> 00:01:00.440
 load notebook or transfer data and 

00:00:58.649 --> 00:01:03.120
 Of course we still have a petterweil 

00:01:00.440 --> 00:01:06.560
 3.5 millimeter jack and the phaeton it 

00:01:03.120 --> 00:01:09.750
 is not in the heat but nothing 

00:01:06.560 --> 00:01:11.100
 because this is the important and indeed 

00:01:09.750 --> 00:01:13.080
 we have the smartphone around here 

00:01:11.100 --> 00:01:14.450
 a slide that we first pull off 

00:01:13.080 --> 00:01:18.390
 want 

00:01:14.450 --> 00:01:19.650
 and now we burn or something 

00:01:18.390 --> 00:01:22.650
 how the whole thing looks like 

00:01:19.650 --> 00:01:24.930
 the first impression very very chic if 

00:01:22.650 --> 00:01:26.640
 You ask me this accusation 

00:01:24.930 --> 00:01:28.500
 I really like it, I have the blue one 

00:01:26.640 --> 00:01:30.540
 version depending on which you buy 

00:01:28.500 --> 00:01:31.590
 Of course that's different 

00:01:30.540 --> 00:01:35.159
 Fits comfortably in your hand 

00:01:31.590 --> 00:01:37.159
 It has rounded corners rounded 

00:01:35.159 --> 00:01:39.750
 It's all about it 

00:01:37.159 --> 00:01:42.240
 Accordingly, it is also good in hand 

00:01:39.750 --> 00:01:47.460
 is very easy the processing of all 

00:01:42.240 --> 00:01:50.659
 knots true wins detail and indeed 

00:01:47.460 --> 00:01:54.780
 Let's start on the left side 

00:01:50.659 --> 00:01:57.030
 so I saw that well that we 

00:01:54.780 --> 00:01:58.530
 nothing on these people only have 

00:01:57.030 --> 00:02:01.020
 the beautiful stuff i really do 

00:01:58.530 --> 00:02:02.119
 feels very good we can see this here 

00:02:01.020 --> 00:02:05.939
 crossing 

00:02:02.119 --> 00:02:07.079
 here is a little slit and that 

00:02:05.939 --> 00:02:09.660
 could either mean that 

00:02:07.079 --> 00:02:12.319
 processing shit is or that we are there 

00:02:09.660 --> 00:02:14.299
 can do something else or both 

00:02:12.319 --> 00:02:15.469
 the processing is not that I say 

00:02:14.299 --> 00:02:17.689
 you directly but we can do it 

00:02:15.469 --> 00:02:19.400
 we will make the first differences 

00:02:17.689 --> 00:02:21.680
 other side to the right here see the 

00:02:19.400 --> 00:02:23.060
 volume rocker with a wonderful 

00:02:21.680 --> 00:02:25.280
 pressure point as well as the extra 

00:02:23.060 --> 00:02:28.810
 camera button the whole thing is so 

00:02:25.280 --> 00:02:31.579
 little bit from now you can see that 

00:02:28.810 --> 00:02:35.420
 if he focuses properly , you do not care 

00:02:31.579 --> 00:02:37.069
 See that too top comes now 

00:02:35.420 --> 00:02:39.379
 There is not more in here 

00:02:37.069 --> 00:02:41.540
 extension work and the 35 millimeters 

00:02:39.379 --> 00:02:44.090
 jack connection for libyer headset in 

00:02:41.540 --> 00:02:45.919
 have this size on the bottom 

00:02:44.090 --> 00:02:48.739
 We use a microphone to call and 

00:02:45.919 --> 00:02:50.180
 a micro usb connection and now 

00:02:48.739 --> 00:02:51.949
 we come to the map because you can 

00:02:50.180 --> 00:02:53.510
 Go somewhere you have it 

00:02:51.949 --> 00:02:56.079
 surely you have to think already 

00:02:53.510 --> 00:02:58.699
 namely the sim card purely do and 

00:02:56.079 --> 00:02:59.510
 also leaves the micro sd flash memory 

00:02:58.699 --> 00:03:01.909
 to expand 

00:02:59.510 --> 00:03:04.639
 You have to do it with a mixture 

00:03:01.909 --> 00:03:07.540
 many feel more positive and negative 

00:03:04.639 --> 00:03:09.709
 type this cap 

00:03:07.540 --> 00:03:11.269
 I stand there currently still real 

00:03:09.709 --> 00:03:14.829
 I'm so scared that I'm so scared 

00:03:11.269 --> 00:03:17.659
 The display destroys you 

00:03:14.829 --> 00:03:19.129
 somehow you have to deduct that gives 

00:03:17.659 --> 00:03:21.109
 bit of the advantage is that you can do that 

00:03:19.129 --> 00:03:23.599
 does not make regular and therefore is 

00:03:21.109 --> 00:03:24.169
 it pretty sausage but sits bombproof 

00:03:23.599 --> 00:03:28.459
 the part 

00:03:24.169 --> 00:03:31.400
 here in here I have both pure we 

00:03:28.459 --> 00:03:33.049
 on the one hand the antennas but so recognizes 

00:03:31.400 --> 00:03:34.549
 you do not have the antennas yet 

00:03:33.049 --> 00:03:35.930
 That's why we need to call 

00:03:34.549 --> 00:03:37.459
 take care that they do not do it all 

00:03:35.930 --> 00:03:39.949
 somehow very destructive 

00:03:37.459 --> 00:03:41.629
 this comes again for the micro sd 

00:03:39.949 --> 00:03:43.939
 card and any amount for the micro sim 

00:03:41.629 --> 00:03:45.590
 card means you still need one 

00:03:43.939 --> 00:03:48.379
 micro sim card if the still no 

00:03:45.590 --> 00:03:51.829
 to cut or cut to size 

00:03:48.379 --> 00:03:53.090
 let it come up to you 

00:03:51.829 --> 00:03:55.430
 back side when we are already there 

00:03:53.090 --> 00:03:58.069
 looks really very nice to feel 

00:03:55.430 --> 00:03:58.430
 wonderful to catch you below 

00:03:58.069 --> 00:04:00.079
 on 

00:03:58.430 --> 00:04:03.199
 we have a speaker and we 

00:04:00.079 --> 00:04:06.829
 see a b for beats audio as the new one 

00:04:03.199 --> 00:04:09.709
 technology in there then that comes 

00:04:06.829 --> 00:04:12.049
 htc logo and then comes a nice and 

00:04:09.709 --> 00:04:14.319
 rang in the final phase of the mountain 

00:04:12.049 --> 00:04:17.959
 smartphones we choose ourselves 

00:04:14.319 --> 00:04:18.530
 follow around the lens 

00:04:17.959 --> 00:04:20.239
 lens 

00:04:18.530 --> 00:04:21.040
 we have five megapixel camera the 

00:04:20.239 --> 00:04:24.160
 videos in 

00:04:21.040 --> 00:04:26.830
 So that can receive 720p who my 

00:04:24.160 --> 00:04:29.710
 bsi sensor dexheim luminet so 

00:04:26.830 --> 00:04:33.820
 backward lit from behind by quasi 

00:04:29.710 --> 00:04:35.380
 An aperture of f / 2 8 9 35 mm lens 

00:04:33.820 --> 00:04:37.630
 and the whole thing sounds pretty nice 

00:04:35.380 --> 00:04:38.170
 Let's see if she missed what she did 

00:04:37.630 --> 00:04:40.240
 promises 

00:04:38.170 --> 00:04:43.420
 They have a single led us as 

00:04:40.240 --> 00:04:45.970
 lightning the otherwise hammer next 

00:04:43.420 --> 00:04:48.460
 that's why we go to the front of the 

00:04:45.970 --> 00:04:55.480
 We'll clean it up first 

00:04:48.460 --> 00:04:58.330
 does not look so beautiful so lovingly 

00:04:55.480 --> 00:05:00.970
 cleaned with mamas housekeeping or 

00:04:58.330 --> 00:05:02.590
 we see something like that here 

00:05:00.970 --> 00:05:05.620
 beautiful housing and a blue below 

00:05:02.590 --> 00:05:07.720
 conclusion in this conclusion we see 

00:05:05.620 --> 00:05:09.400
 a back button a city or in the 

00:05:07.720 --> 00:05:11.500
 search button the specific ones 

00:05:09.400 --> 00:05:13.150
 typical windows phone buttons and now 

00:05:11.500 --> 00:05:16.000
 just do not understand how nice in that 

00:05:13.150 --> 00:05:18.070
 the display you mean narrow edge and 

00:05:16.000 --> 00:05:20.710
 it runs up here specifically 

00:05:18.070 --> 00:05:22.900
 10.2 centimeters long in the diagonal 

00:05:20.710 --> 00:05:25.930
 These are also four inches is a great 

00:05:22.900 --> 00:05:29.760
 lcd display so super lcd and lavender 

00:05:25.930 --> 00:05:33.120
 VGA resolution 800 x 480 pixels 

00:05:29.760 --> 00:05:35.860
 above we see the accentuated 

00:05:33.120 --> 00:05:37.390
 earpiece we see that htc logo and 

00:05:35.860 --> 00:05:39.030
 What we do not see no matter how far here 

00:05:37.390 --> 00:05:42.450
 a sum is one in it 

00:05:39.030 --> 00:05:45.160
 Notification led wonderfully 

00:05:42.450 --> 00:05:48.160
 we could do it now, depending on the light 

00:05:45.160 --> 00:05:51.730
 play put sharp camera here 

00:05:48.160 --> 00:05:55.000
 above, if so, are the renovation 

00:05:51.730 --> 00:05:57.820
 sensor example and and and let me 

00:05:55.000 --> 00:06:04.600
 a little bit of trying those around 

00:05:57.820 --> 00:06:06.490
 packing it already so that what was there was there 

00:06:04.600 --> 00:06:09.160
 can just imagine again here 

00:06:06.490 --> 00:06:12.160
 that is now from the light reflexes he is 

00:06:09.160 --> 00:06:14.520
 now you see that as well we see 

00:06:12.160 --> 00:06:18.940
 now again the rounded corners 

00:06:14.520 --> 00:06:20.680
 and dry skin on my finger yes so 

00:06:18.940 --> 00:06:23.070
 it looks like that was the case i 

00:06:20.680 --> 00:06:25.780
 think you have seen that now 

00:06:23.070 --> 00:06:30.970
 in total it is 120 5 

00:06:25.780 --> 00:06:33.910
 millimeter high 63 mm wide and 10 28 mm 

00:06:30.970 --> 00:06:36.220
 So it's just under a mile thick 

00:06:33.910 --> 00:06:38.380
 weighs only 113 grams which is really very 

00:06:36.220 --> 00:06:38.980
 It is very easy and it is wonderful 

00:06:38.380 --> 00:06:40.450
 in the hand 

00:06:38.980 --> 00:06:41.950
 not only because of the size and the 

00:06:40.450 --> 00:06:44.940
 rounded shapes but simply because 

00:06:41.950 --> 00:06:47.680
 It is also light and feels good 

00:06:44.940 --> 00:06:49.480
 1400 mill 

00:06:47.680 --> 00:06:51.040
 permanently installed battery installed 

00:06:49.480 --> 00:06:53.470
 unfortunately not really for us 

00:06:51.040 --> 00:06:56.280
 interchangeable next to four gigabytes 

00:06:53.470 --> 00:06:58.750
 internal memory somewhere stuck 

00:06:56.280 --> 00:07:00.520
 expandable via micro sd card has it 

00:06:58.750 --> 00:07:04.000
 the ones seen below and we have seven 

00:07:00.520 --> 00:07:06.250
 gigabyte online store smaller 

00:07:04.000 --> 00:07:11.470
 size comparison let's do one 

00:07:06.250 --> 00:07:13.200
 small with the htc desire hd is coming out 

00:07:11.470 --> 00:07:15.460
 same factory 

00:07:13.200 --> 00:07:18.880
 You could theoretically use this 

00:07:15.460 --> 00:07:20.410
 Understand her and also from the 

00:07:18.880 --> 00:07:23.620
 page 8 you could do something now 

00:07:20.410 --> 00:07:27.340
 To say that, it looks at everyone 

00:07:23.620 --> 00:07:29.800
 case in comparison out there may still be 

00:07:27.340 --> 00:07:31.740
 his black blue red and gray are the ones 

00:07:29.800 --> 00:07:33.490
 Available colors pay approx 

00:07:31.740 --> 00:07:35.290
 250 to 300 euros 

00:07:33.490 --> 00:07:36.790
 and if you're up for it you can do it 

00:07:35.290 --> 00:07:38.140
 order because it is available 

00:07:36.790 --> 00:07:41.530
 for example, at gc 

00:07:38.140 --> 00:07:45.100
 that 's it, that was mine 

00:07:41.530 --> 00:07:46.720
 unboxing to windows phone 8 it at htc 

00:07:45.100 --> 00:07:48.250
 I'll leave it now while I'm still here 

00:07:46.720 --> 00:07:50.919
 talk through a bit 

00:07:48.250 --> 00:07:53.910
 the camera whizzes with it 

00:07:50.919 --> 00:07:57.700
 you have some nice pictures to 

00:07:53.910 --> 00:07:59.020
 See I can am delighted that 

00:07:57.700 --> 00:08:00.340
 she would have turned me on 

00:07:59.020 --> 00:08:02.080
 happy if you subscribe to my feed 

00:08:00.340 --> 00:08:04.210
 if you give me a thumbs up for 

00:08:02.080 --> 00:08:07.780
 this video gives and the video to all 

00:08:04.210 --> 00:08:09.400
 people you know I recommend 

00:08:07.780 --> 00:08:10.120
 Thank you for your time hope it has 

00:08:09.400 --> 00:08:13.350
 you like it 

00:08:10.120 --> 00:08:13.350
 Goodbye makes it good
