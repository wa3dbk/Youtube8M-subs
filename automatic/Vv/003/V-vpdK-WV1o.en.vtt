 I often write what they want 

00:01:15.930 --> 00:01:20.640
 start a letter or send something to me 

00:01:18.509 --> 00:01:22.110

 send not only to me but you can 

00:01:30.329 --> 00:01:35.369
 send also about whether i think so far probably 

00:01:33.240 --> 00:01:37.020
 everything is possible to one address because all 

00:01:35.369 --> 00:01:39.360

00:01:37.020 --> 00:01:43.579
 I will deliver nothing to watch I will not promise 

00:01:39.360 --> 00:01:45.899
 I am writing this is very personal so yes 

00:01:43.579 --> 00:01:49.710
 just probably the letter will need 

00:01:45.899 --> 00:01:52.439
 mark for oli and oli 

00:01:49.710 --> 00:01:54.329
 just like that so that you can 

00:01:52.439 --> 00:01:56.490
 understand for whom exactly the letter and us 

00:01:54.329 --> 00:01:58.799
 it will be insanely solid nice to get from 

00:01:56.490 --> 00:02:00.540
 you some news because to me 

00:01:58.799 --> 00:02:03.030
 a lot of writing on the 

00:02:00.540 --> 00:02:05.640
 I thought they even wrote a lot of mail 

00:02:03.030 --> 00:02:07.410
 by email and know for me 

00:02:05.640 --> 00:02:09.450
 it feels like that 

00:02:07.410 --> 00:02:11.400
 They say that email paper 

00:02:09.450 --> 00:02:13.260
 these are different things but for some reason for me 

00:02:11.400 --> 00:02:15.060
 it's like it 's so warm when people 

00:02:13.260 --> 00:02:17.610
 they write some emotions themselves 

00:02:15.060 --> 00:02:19.800
 impressions of the day it's crazy 

00:02:17.610 --> 00:02:23.040
 Surprisingly I think that if such 

00:02:19.800 --> 00:02:25.560
 will happen also live to live 

00:02:23.040 --> 00:02:27.630
 it will bring even more emotions not 

00:02:25.560 --> 00:02:29.820
 only to us between you and us too 

00:02:27.630 --> 00:02:32.310
 probably I personally, I want to practice 

00:02:29.820 --> 00:02:34.830

00:02:32.310 --> 00:02:37.140

00:02:37.140 --> 00:02:40.860
 air and minute answer and share with 

00:02:39.030 --> 00:02:42.420
 by your thoughts that I get for 

00:02:40.860 --> 00:02:45.060
 the moment I open the letter or 

00:02:42.420 --> 00:02:46.830
 package when the dream is sent is just 

00:02:45.060 --> 00:02:50.459
