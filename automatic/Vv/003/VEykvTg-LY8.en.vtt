00:00:01.820 --> 00:00:06.420
 Babayan for some reason on youtube and enjoys 

00:00:04.470 --> 00:00:09.599
 popular just in case my 

00:00:06.420 --> 00:00:12.230
 videos where I talk about that from 

00:00:09.599 --> 00:00:15.389
 the shell is the dance therefore decided to remove 

00:00:12.230 --> 00:00:20.180
 such a video made such a cap from 

00:00:15.389 --> 00:00:23.609
 old jeans what can they tell 

00:00:20.180 --> 00:00:26.550
 sewing cap problems is that these 

00:00:23.609 --> 00:00:29.730
 here are the wedges they are not triangular they 

00:00:26.550 --> 00:00:32.070
 little such a form 

00:00:29.730 --> 00:00:36.270
 that is, not here such but how would you 

00:00:32.070 --> 00:00:38.960
 understood here they are expanding slightly 

00:00:36.270 --> 00:00:45.440
 she goes along the arc so curved out 

00:00:38.960 --> 00:00:48.270
 that's what else can you sew a cap about 

00:00:45.440 --> 00:00:50.910
 some kind of inventing that is possible 

00:00:48.270 --> 00:00:52.829
 find somewhere i found 

00:00:50.910 --> 00:00:56.039
 I now do not remember what kind of book to me 

00:00:52.829 --> 00:00:58.489
 even that is, information how to calculate that 

00:00:56.039 --> 00:01:00.930
 there is how much this arc should be 

00:00:58.489 --> 00:01:02.609
 this distance is taken 

00:01:00.930 --> 00:01:06.600
 somehow there she is by some formula 

00:01:02.609 --> 00:01:09.799
 It is considered how much to add here 

00:01:06.600 --> 00:01:13.520
 it's all take a long look for this formula 

00:01:09.799 --> 00:01:16.290
 much easier to take the old cap favorite 

00:01:13.520 --> 00:01:20.220
 which sat on you well I had 

00:01:16.290 --> 00:01:22.799
 such a green cap she looked and 

00:01:20.220 --> 00:01:25.439
 is somehow not walk it was here 

00:01:22.799 --> 00:01:27.000
 I could still overcome it, but I 

00:01:25.439 --> 00:01:30.420
 decided to make it 

00:01:27.000 --> 00:01:31.970
 Cap thawed neatly 

00:01:30.420 --> 00:01:36.150
 by this 

00:01:31.970 --> 00:01:39.079
 wedge laid laid smoothed 

00:01:36.150 --> 00:01:42.630
 laid on 100 pairs of jeans and cut out 

00:01:39.079 --> 00:01:45.060
 well and sew accordingly 

00:01:42.630 --> 00:01:47.939
 here's what else here here usually goes 

00:01:45.060 --> 00:01:49.979
 I’m not covered with such a button 

00:01:47.939 --> 00:01:52.200
 how to do it well and lost to do 

00:01:49.979 --> 00:01:57.960
 ventilation set love that is if 

00:01:52.200 --> 00:01:59.460
 here you can see here the hole on the back velcro 

00:01:57.960 --> 00:02:03.319
 did that is you can this plastmassku 

00:01:59.460 --> 00:02:05.850
 sewn well I decided not a handful of me was blue 

00:02:03.319 --> 00:02:07.860
 the guard something like that somewhere over here is bad 

00:02:05.850 --> 00:02:10.530
 in sight but wears this blue here 

00:02:07.860 --> 00:02:12.420
 black because, well if 

00:02:10.530 --> 00:02:14.790
 hanging around here hanging around this 

00:02:12.420 --> 00:02:19.700
 hanging out will not be me only blue 

00:02:14.790 --> 00:02:24.480
 such a piece is not both of one 

00:02:19.700 --> 00:02:27.780
 options here what else visor here just 

00:02:24.480 --> 00:02:32.040
 used racket from to favorite here 

00:02:27.780 --> 00:02:34.230
 a little crooked that's what 

00:02:32.040 --> 00:02:36.810
 we also need besides the old jeans 

00:02:34.230 --> 00:02:40.440
 we need water here so here 

00:02:36.810 --> 00:02:43.950
 a ribbon in a circle here 

00:02:40.440 --> 00:02:46.140
 I usually also need to let the ribbon but 

00:02:43.950 --> 00:02:50.459
 than problems as where it is necessary to sew either 

00:02:46.140 --> 00:02:53.630
 at night or at some such garment 

00:02:50.459 --> 00:02:56.160
 the machine to turn in its underlay 

00:02:53.630 --> 00:02:58.079
 to work with one hand 

00:02:56.160 --> 00:03:01.560
 hand do it and twist it not 

00:02:58.079 --> 00:03:03.900
 uncomfortable so I'm eating for you I'm 

00:03:01.560 --> 00:03:05.880
 Juche decided for myself that's my bad boy 

00:03:03.900 --> 00:03:09.450
 slippers sticks out this chip to in 

00:03:05.880 --> 00:03:12.370
 It’s basically just you here 

00:03:09.450 --> 00:03:14.680
 me here is done different here it is 

00:03:12.370 --> 00:03:19.030
 see how we see two stripes go 

00:03:14.680 --> 00:03:24.640
 next to that is first dark 

00:03:19.030 --> 00:03:27.190
 thread then the edges are curved and plowing here 

00:03:24.640 --> 00:03:29.140
 here it is also made easier to sew first 

00:03:27.190 --> 00:03:30.909
 dark then so here is bent in 

00:03:29.140 --> 00:03:34.569
 one side and stitched here here 

00:03:30.909 --> 00:03:36.400
 done the same way here too 2 double 

00:03:34.569 --> 00:03:38.730
 so much so symmetrical here it is 

00:03:36.400 --> 00:03:42.180
 turned out pretty 

00:03:38.730 --> 00:03:46.120
 that's what I'm here for Vishnu is sheathed by Rashit 

00:03:42.180 --> 00:03:49.060
 bottom here bottom tucked and came 

00:03:46.120 --> 00:03:52.120
 In general, well, that is, everything is like sewing and it's like 

00:03:49.060 --> 00:03:54.099
 since we are looking at how a cap is made 

00:03:52.120 --> 00:03:55.840
 from it only sit trestle 

00:03:54.099 --> 00:03:59.230
 only for the year you were originally 

00:03:55.840 --> 00:04:01.290
 stitched a greater amount with but it 

00:03:59.230 --> 00:04:05.470
 that's what's inside there and doing it 

00:04:01.290 --> 00:04:07.299
 does not interfere here a little bit on dirty because 

00:04:05.470 --> 00:04:09.640
 as for long over-summer why 

00:04:07.299 --> 00:04:11.680
 here on dirty because you can 

00:04:09.640 --> 00:04:13.629
 make you mass who but I realized that I 

00:04:11.680 --> 00:04:16.389
 this one in this place and usually take 

00:04:13.629 --> 00:04:19.599
 When I correct rented dress dirty 

00:04:16.389 --> 00:04:21.310
 hands well, again, we are not done 

00:04:19.599 --> 00:04:24.060
 as here there is a little bit darker front 

00:04:21.310 --> 00:04:27.960
 part of the teachers selected 

00:04:24.060 --> 00:04:31.389
 that is, again we choose which 

00:04:27.960 --> 00:04:33.610
 the direction of the fabric I honestly 

00:04:31.389 --> 00:04:35.919
 laid out in my tone everyones there 

00:04:33.610 --> 00:04:39.460
 loaf thread not topping up 

00:04:35.919 --> 00:04:42.669
 making laid out to no less 

00:04:39.460 --> 00:04:46.030
 quantity used in principle here 

00:04:42.669 --> 00:04:49.810
 she here she goes now on this or on 

00:04:46.030 --> 00:04:51.550
 not bad that he will go to look here here 

00:04:49.810 --> 00:04:52.620
 as it turned out well in one 

00:04:51.550 --> 00:04:55.880
 side on 

00:04:52.620 --> 00:04:59.850
 here is a holiday like 

00:04:55.880 --> 00:05:01.770
 that is, she is in this regard, but here 

00:04:59.850 --> 00:05:03.600
 it turned out, and what about such an indicator 

00:05:01.770 --> 00:05:07.710
 then pretty slim jess she is very 

00:05:03.600 --> 00:05:12.380
 light and soft 

00:05:07.710 --> 00:05:20.070
 I’ll take the content normally 

00:05:12.380 --> 00:05:21.780
 occupies little space will not tell how well 

00:05:20.070 --> 00:05:26.910
 These are all this already I thought to embroider 

00:05:21.780 --> 00:05:28.050
 You have increased, that is, this is the second 

00:05:26.910 --> 00:05:30.780
 life of things 

00:05:28.050 --> 00:05:33.600
 plus you could just pull out i did 

00:05:30.780 --> 00:05:35.970
 of them here this 

00:05:33.600 --> 00:05:40.590
 what could be the problem here in this 

00:05:35.970 --> 00:05:46.290
 arc like here and tap dance sew visor I 

00:05:40.590 --> 00:05:48.630
 I honestly don’t remember but again 

00:05:46.290 --> 00:05:54.120
 I had a plastic for it 

00:05:48.630 --> 00:05:55.980
 as if setting an arc 

00:05:54.120 --> 00:05:57.750
 a small visor can be like 

00:05:55.980 --> 00:06:00.930
 love with long visors 

00:05:57.750 --> 00:06:04.530
 I like it here just and axon 

00:06:00.930 --> 00:06:06.060
 This is not fashionable like now with pots 

00:06:04.530 --> 00:06:09.510
 long visor like 

00:06:06.060 --> 00:06:12.289
 Chotky boys Chotky boys walk with 

00:06:09.510 --> 00:06:16.199
 a long visor on such here that case 

00:06:12.289 --> 00:06:18.360
 such as dad and so what they 

00:06:16.199 --> 00:06:21.289
 of course pots and both me not 

00:06:18.360 --> 00:06:24.120
 like i did what i like 

00:06:21.289 --> 00:06:25.889
 also than there is no nomination here 

00:06:24.120 --> 00:06:29.580

00:06:46.800 --> 00:06:51.860
 for ventilation to make holes 

00:06:48.629 --> 00:06:53.639
 but I already she principle so pretty 

00:06:51.860 --> 00:06:58.050
 thin well and here 

00:06:53.639 --> 00:07:01.789
 approximate color can be made as 

00:06:58.050 --> 00:07:08.120
