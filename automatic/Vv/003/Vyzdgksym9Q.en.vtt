 evening is already good because it was 

00:01:18.689 --> 00:01:22.170
 very very big day as long as the 

00:01:20.460 --> 00:01:24.299

00:01:22.170 --> 00:01:25.020
 long difficult we have eight seconds of 

00:01:24.299 --> 00:01:27.960
 the first place 

00:01:25.020 --> 00:01:29.790
 we did a scratch so tomorrow 

00:01:27.960 --> 00:01:35.729
 the goal is to maintain the pressure 

00:01:29.790 --> 00:01:38.520
 on the leader and and we want to win 40 

00:01:35.729 --> 00:01:40.530

00:01:38.520 --> 00:01:42.370
 centimeters to undocumented 

00:01:40.530 --> 00:01:46.560
 two hundred and twenty thousand islands right 

00:01:42.370 --> 00:01:46.560
 in the center we can quickly min 

00:02:00.500 --> 00:02:03.760
 and that happiness is true 

00:02:02.620 --> 00:02:05.650
 we were at the forefront all 

00:02:03.760 --> 00:02:07.420
 weekend we had ups and downs 

00:02:05.650 --> 00:02:09.090
 but I was still in the trio of 

00:02:07.420 --> 00:02:11.260
 head even second all the way 

00:02:09.090 --> 00:02:12.820
 before the last special we leave with 

00:02:11.260 --> 00:02:16.630
 view seconds behind on remy and on 

00:02:12.820 --> 00:02:18.760
 takes them 13 13 15 in the last one 

00:02:16.630 --> 00:02:20.830

00:02:18.760 --> 00:02:23.110
 on the dry ended in the rain 

00:02:20.830 --> 00:02:24.190
 Flapper of Flood to support him it was 

00:02:23.110 --> 00:02:27.070
 a trial 

00:02:24.190 --> 00:02:29.260
 in the end we win in this last 

00:02:27.070 --> 00:02:31.990

00:02:29.260 --> 00:02:35.010
