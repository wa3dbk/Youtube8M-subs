talk<00:00:55.949> about<00:00:56.070> safety<00:00:56.460> first<00:00:56.820> because<00:00:57.660> safety

00:00:57.830 --> 00:00:57.840 
talk about safety first because safety

00:00:57.840 --> 00:00:59.720

really<00:00:58.140> needs<00:00:58.379> to<00:00:58.500> underlie<00:00:58.920> everything<00:00:59.609> that

00:00:59.720 --> 00:00:59.730 
really needs to underlie everything that

00:00:59.730 --> 00:01:02.000 
really needs to underlie everything that
we<00:00:59.850> do<00:01:00.030> with<00:01:00.239> any<00:01:00.449> firearm<00:01:00.839> absolutely<00:01:01.710> and

00:01:02.000 --> 00:01:02.010 
we do with any firearm absolutely and

00:01:02.010 --> 00:01:03.770 
we do with any firearm absolutely and
we've<00:01:02.160> got<00:01:02.309> our<00:01:02.399> four<00:01:02.609> safety<00:01:02.879> rules<00:01:03.239> okay

00:01:03.770 --> 00:01:03.780 
we've got our four safety rules okay

00:01:03.780 --> 00:01:05.960 
we've got our four safety rules okay
rule<00:01:04.260> number<00:01:04.290> one<00:01:04.710> is<00:01:04.890> that<00:01:04.920> all<00:01:05.309> guns<00:01:05.760> are

00:01:05.960 --> 00:01:05.970 
rule number one is that all guns are

00:01:05.970 --> 00:01:08.330 
rule number one is that all guns are
always<00:01:06.180> loaded<00:01:06.360> that's<00:01:07.110> just<00:01:07.320> a<00:01:07.440> mindset<00:01:08.100> that

00:01:08.330 --> 00:01:08.340 
always loaded that's just a mindset that

00:01:08.340 --> 00:01:10.490 
always loaded that's just a mindset that
we<00:01:08.460> adopt<00:01:08.820> and<00:01:09.120> that<00:01:09.570> tells<00:01:09.870> us<00:01:10.020> guys<00:01:10.260> that

00:01:10.490 --> 00:01:10.500 
we adopt and that tells us guys that

00:01:10.500 --> 00:01:13.370 
we adopt and that tells us guys that
it's<00:01:10.620> not<00:01:10.890> ok<00:01:11.550> to<00:01:11.910> behave<00:01:12.330> unsafely<00:01:13.140> with<00:01:13.350> a

00:01:13.370 --> 00:01:13.380 
it's not ok to behave unsafely with a

00:01:13.380 --> 00:01:15.590 
it's not ok to behave unsafely with a
firearm<00:01:13.680> and<00:01:14.189> explain<00:01:14.700> it<00:01:14.850> away<00:01:14.970> by<00:01:15.390> saying

00:01:15.590 --> 00:01:15.600 
firearm and explain it away by saying

00:01:15.600 --> 00:01:18.170 
firearm and explain it away by saying
it's<00:01:16.200> ok<00:01:16.560> it's<00:01:16.829> not<00:01:16.979> loaded<00:01:17.400> because<00:01:17.820> all<00:01:18.000> guns

00:01:18.170 --> 00:01:18.180 
it's ok it's not loaded because all guns

00:01:18.180 --> 00:01:19.789 
it's ok it's not loaded because all guns
are<00:01:18.299> always<00:01:18.450> loaded<00:01:18.540> and<00:01:19.020> that<00:01:19.439> helps<00:01:19.680> me<00:01:19.770> to

00:01:19.789 --> 00:01:19.799 
are always loaded and that helps me to

00:01:19.799 --> 00:01:21.920 
are always loaded and that helps me to
remember<00:01:20.009> rule<00:01:20.400> number<00:01:20.430> two<00:01:20.909> which<00:01:21.509> is<00:01:21.540> that<00:01:21.900> I
