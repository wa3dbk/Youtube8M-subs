Elmer's<00:00:22.080> glue<00:00:22.680> will<00:00:23.070> work<00:00:23.430> I<00:00:24.359> did<00:00:25.289> try<00:00:25.560> some

00:00:26.210 --> 00:00:26.220 
Elmer's glue will work I did try some

00:00:26.220 --> 00:00:29.269 
Elmer's glue will work I did try some
gorilla<00:00:26.849> glue<00:00:27.090> and<00:00:27.359> a<00:00:28.170> six<00:00:28.500> thousand<00:00:28.920> does<00:00:29.099> not

00:00:29.269 --> 00:00:29.279 
gorilla glue and a six thousand does not

00:00:29.279 --> 00:00:30.830 
gorilla glue and a six thousand does not
work<00:00:29.490> because<00:00:29.820> it<00:00:29.970> will<00:00:30.090> eat<00:00:30.330> out<00:00:30.449> the<00:00:30.630> foam

00:00:30.830 --> 00:00:30.840 
work because it will eat out the foam

00:00:30.840 --> 00:00:32.990 
work because it will eat out the foam
core<00:00:31.080> with<00:00:31.679> the<00:00:31.769> razor<00:00:31.949> blade<00:00:32.279> I<00:00:32.309> suggest<00:00:32.820> that

00:00:32.990 --> 00:00:33.000 
core with the razor blade I suggest that

00:00:33.000 --> 00:00:35.420 
core with the razor blade I suggest that
it<00:00:33.239> will<00:00:33.420> it<00:00:33.690> should<00:00:33.989> be<00:00:34.140> very<00:00:34.530> sharp<00:00:35.010> because

00:00:35.420 --> 00:00:35.430 
it will it should be very sharp because

00:00:35.430 --> 00:00:39.410 
it will it should be very sharp because
if<00:00:35.640> it's<00:00:35.820> dull<00:00:36.239> it'll<00:00:36.780> just<00:00:37.140> cut<00:00:38.100> the<00:00:38.760> foam

00:00:39.410 --> 00:00:39.420 
if it's dull it'll just cut the foam

00:00:39.420 --> 00:00:43.250 
if it's dull it'll just cut the foam
board<00:00:40.010> badly<00:00:41.010> and<00:00:41.340> it'll<00:00:42.000> tear<00:00:42.450> up<00:00:42.660> the<00:00:42.960> foam

00:00:43.250 --> 00:00:43.260

00:01:12.469 --> 00:01:12.479 
started okay so instead of using the

actually going to do a voiceover but

00:01:16.259 --> 00:01:18.830 
actually going to do a voiceover but
here<00:01:16.619> is<00:01:16.830> what<00:01:17.280> the<00:01:17.759> display<00:01:18.270> board<00:01:18.570> should

00:01:18.830 --> 00:01:18.840 
here is what the display board should

00:01:18.840 --> 00:01:21.590 
here is what the display board should
look<00:01:18.990> like<00:01:19.020> when<00:01:19.470> you<00:01:19.680> are<00:01:19.710> done<00:01:20.130> I<00:01:20.430> use<00:01:21.299> the

00:01:21.590 --> 00:01:21.600 
look like when you are done I use the

00:01:21.600 --> 00:01:24.289 
look like when you are done I use the
smallest<00:01:22.070> measurement<00:01:23.070> I<00:01:23.280> could<00:01:23.549> to<00:01:23.820> use<00:01:24.000> the

00:01:24.289 --> 00:01:24.299 
smallest measurement I could to use the

00:01:24.299 --> 00:01:27.800 
smallest measurement I could to use the
most<00:01:24.960> out<00:01:25.590> of<00:01:25.619> my<00:01:25.770> board<00:01:26.310> and<00:01:26.549> I<00:01:27.240> also<00:01:27.390> wanted

00:01:27.800 --> 00:01:27.810 
most out of my board and I also wanted

00:01:27.810 --> 00:01:30.380 
most out of my board and I also wanted
so<00:01:28.020> many<00:01:28.290> of<00:01:28.439> them<00:01:28.650> this<00:01:29.220> fits<00:01:29.579> like<00:01:29.759> a<00:01:29.820> puffy

00:01:30.380 --> 00:01:30.390

00:01:30.390 --> 00:01:33.590 
so many of them this fits like a puffy
heart<00:01:30.689> as<00:01:31.350> you<00:01:31.530> can<00:01:31.650> see<00:01:31.799> on<00:01:31.950> my<00:01:32.210> picture<00:01:33.210> in

change<00:01:43.380> the<00:01:43.740> measurement<00:01:44.189> of<00:01:44.579> each<00:01:44.790> one<00:01:45.060> and

00:01:45.200 --> 00:01:45.210 
change the measurement of each one and

00:01:45.210 --> 00:01:47.630 
change the measurement of each one and
make<00:01:45.450> it<00:01:45.600> at<00:01:45.780> any<00:01:46.049> size<00:01:46.680> you<00:01:46.920> want<00:01:47.220> it<00:01:47.310> to<00:01:47.490> be

00:02:31.310 --> 00:02:31.320 
yeah when you first start you cut your

00:02:31.320 --> 00:02:37.040 
yeah when you first start you cut your
strips<00:02:31.740> of<00:02:32.870> foam<00:02:33.870> board<00:02:34.080> like<00:02:34.770> this<00:02:34.800> and<00:02:36.050> you

strips of foam board like this and you

00:02:37.050 --> 00:02:38.570 
strips of foam board like this and you
should<00:02:37.080> get<00:02:37.380> ten<00:02:37.740> because<00:02:38.100> they're<00:02:38.280> all<00:02:38.430> going

00:02:38.570 --> 00:02:38.580 
should get ten because they're all going

should get ten because they're all going
to<00:02:38.670> be<00:02:38.790> three<00:02:39.270> inches<00:02:39.690> and<00:02:39.990> then<00:02:40.740> you<00:02:41.130> get<00:02:41.490> a

to be three inches and then you get a

00:02:42.530 --> 00:02:46.750 
to be three inches and then you get a
three<00:02:43.530> inch<00:02:43.709> by<00:02:44.700> three<00:02:45.090> inch<00:02:45.120> square<00:02:45.780> and<00:02:46.080> in

00:02:46.750 --> 00:02:46.760 
three inch by three inch square and in

00:02:46.760 --> 00:02:50.930 
three inch by three inch square and in
each<00:02:47.760> strip<00:02:48.180> you<00:02:48.360> should<00:02:48.600> get<00:02:48.870> one<00:02:49.680> piece<00:02:50.640> of

00:02:50.930 --> 00:02:50.940 
each strip you should get one piece of

00:02:50.940 --> 00:02:55.550 
each strip you should get one piece of
two<00:02:51.780> inch<00:02:51.810> by<00:02:52.560> three<00:02:52.890> inch<00:02:53.420> rectangle<00:02:54.560> so

00:02:55.550 --> 00:02:55.560 
two inch by three inch rectangle so

00:04:08.329 --> 00:04:12.170 
from the edge also on the other side
here<00:04:09.829> so<00:04:10.829> what<00:04:10.980> you're<00:04:11.130> trying<00:04:11.280> to<00:04:11.489> do<00:04:11.730> is<00:04:11.970> make

a little square at the top now you also

00:04:14.400 --> 00:04:16.250 
a little square at the top now you also
have<00:04:14.549> to<00:04:14.760> do<00:04:14.880> that<00:04:15.060> at<00:04:15.180> the<00:04:15.329> bottom<00:04:15.540> because

00:04:16.250 --> 00:04:16.260 
have to do that at the bottom because

00:04:16.260 --> 00:04:20.370 
have to do that at the bottom because
from<00:04:16.979> the<00:04:17.160> top<00:04:17.750> to<00:04:18.750> bottom<00:04:18.959> you're<00:04:19.500> going<00:04:19.709> to

00:04:20.370 --> 00:04:20.380 
from the top to bottom you're going to

00:04:20.380 --> 00:04:24.570 
from the top to bottom you're going to
cut<00:04:20.590> there<00:04:21.220> in<00:04:21.670> those<00:04:21.940> marks<00:04:22.420> to<00:04:23.430> get<00:04:24.430> that

00:04:24.570 --> 00:04:24.580 
cut there in those marks to get that

00:04:24.580 --> 00:04:27.240 
cut there in those marks to get that
angle<00:04:24.940> look<00:04:25.180> and<00:04:25.390> here<00:04:25.930> I'm<00:04:26.080> doing<00:04:26.350> the<00:04:26.830> other

00:04:27.240 --> 00:04:27.250 
angle look and here I'm doing the other

00:04:27.250 --> 00:04:30.690 
angle look and here I'm doing the other
one<00:04:27.460> half<00:04:27.820> of<00:04:28.000> an<00:04:28.150> inch<00:04:28.390> in<00:04:28.980> the<00:04:29.980> upper<00:04:30.310> corner

00:04:30.690 --> 00:04:30.700 
one half of an inch in the upper corner

00:04:30.700 --> 00:04:33.150 
one half of an inch in the upper corner
and<00:04:30.880> this<00:04:31.750> is<00:04:31.960> what<00:04:32.290> it<00:04:32.560> should

00:04:33.150 --> 00:04:33.160 
and this is what it should

00:04:33.160 --> 00:04:35.070 
and this is what it should
well<00:04:33.820> I'm<00:04:33.910> drawing<00:04:34.240> out<00:04:34.390> the<00:04:34.420> line<00:04:34.720> of<00:04:34.900> where

00:04:35.070 --> 00:04:35.080 
well I'm drawing out the line of where

00:04:35.080 --> 00:04:42.090 
well I'm drawing out the line of where
it<00:04:35.170> should<00:04:35.350> be<00:04:35.380> cut<00:04:35.770> at<00:04:39.600> so<00:04:40.600> now<00:04:41.020> you<00:04:41.080> just<00:04:41.500> take

00:04:42.090 --> 00:04:42.100 
it should be cut at so now you just take

00:04:42.100 --> 00:04:45.570 
it should be cut at so now you just take
your<00:04:42.370> razor<00:04:42.670> blade<00:04:43.060> and<00:04:43.200> I<00:04:44.200> like<00:04:45.070> to<00:04:45.310> have<00:04:45.430> it

00:04:45.570 --> 00:04:45.580 
your razor blade and I like to have it

00:04:45.580 --> 00:04:48.060 
your razor blade and I like to have it
out<00:04:45.760> a<00:04:45.790> little<00:04:46.030> bit<00:04:46.240> more<00:04:46.510> that<00:04:47.320> way<00:04:47.500> I<00:04:47.530> know<00:04:47.680> it

00:04:48.060 --> 00:04:48.070 
out a little bit more that way I know it

00:04:48.070 --> 00:04:51.900 
out a little bit more that way I know it
goes<00:04:48.250> through<00:04:48.670> the<00:04:49.420> foam<00:04:50.260> board<00:04:50.910> completely

00:04:51.900 --> 00:04:51.910 
goes through the foam board completely

00:04:51.910 --> 00:04:54.750 
goes through the foam board completely
now<00:04:52.750> actually<00:04:53.200> my<00:04:53.350> razor<00:04:53.560> blade<00:04:53.920> here<00:04:54.310> on<00:04:54.550> this

00:04:54.750 --> 00:04:54.760 
now actually my razor blade here on this

00:04:54.760 --> 00:04:57.330 
now actually my razor blade here on this
tutorial<00:04:55.360> I<00:04:55.540> got<00:04:55.750> so<00:04:56.020> dull<00:04:56.350> after<00:04:56.740> making<00:04:57.190> all

00:04:57.330 --> 00:04:57.340 
tutorial I got so dull after making all

00:04:57.340 --> 00:05:00.060 
tutorial I got so dull after making all
those<00:04:57.550> displays<00:04:58.260> but<00:04:59.260> just<00:04:59.680> cut<00:04:59.890> off<00:05:00.040> that

00:05:00.060 --> 00:05:00.070 
those displays but just cut off that

00:05:00.070 --> 00:05:03.600 
those displays but just cut off that
little<00:05:00.730> bitty<00:05:01.450> square<00:05:01.960> you<00:05:02.230> made<00:05:02.500> on<00:05:02.800> the<00:05:03.370> top

00:05:03.600 --> 00:05:03.610 
little bitty square you made on the top

00:05:03.610 --> 00:05:13.510 
little bitty square you made on the top
corners

00:05:13.510 --> 00:05:13.520 

00:05:13.520 --> 00:05:18.190 

you

00:05:18.190 --> 00:05:18.200 

00:05:18.200 --> 00:05:21.620 

after<00:05:19.200> cutting<00:05:19.410> those<00:05:19.740> off<00:05:20.070> from<00:05:20.610> that<00:05:20.880> new

00:05:21.620 --> 00:05:21.630 
after cutting those off from that new

00:05:21.630 --> 00:05:24.080 
after cutting those off from that new
little<00:05:22.020> corner<00:05:22.470> you<00:05:22.620> made<00:05:22.890> into<00:05:23.700> the

00:05:24.080 --> 00:05:24.090 
little corner you made into the

00:05:24.090 --> 00:05:27.260 
little corner you made into the
half-inch<00:05:25.280> measurement<00:05:26.280> you<00:05:26.700> had<00:05:26.940> at<00:05:27.240> the

00:05:27.260 --> 00:05:27.270 
half-inch measurement you had at the

00:05:27.270 --> 00:05:30.110 
half-inch measurement you had at the
bottom<00:05:27.750> of<00:05:27.870> the<00:05:27.960> display<00:05:28.260> just<00:05:28.710> cut<00:05:29.220> an<00:05:29.490> angle

00:05:30.110 --> 00:05:30.120 
bottom of the display just cut an angle

00:05:30.120 --> 00:05:33.050 
bottom of the display just cut an angle
all<00:05:31.080> the<00:05:31.140> way<00:05:31.410> down<00:05:31.740> from<00:05:31.980> top<00:05:32.310> to<00:05:32.580> bottom<00:05:32.730> and

00:05:33.050 --> 00:05:33.060 
all the way down from top to bottom and

00:05:33.060 --> 00:05:44.999 
all the way down from top to bottom and
that's<00:05:33.240> how<00:05:33.420> you<00:05:33.480> get<00:05:33.660> the<00:05:33.840> angle<00:05:34.230> look

00:05:44.999 --> 00:05:45.009 

00:05:45.009 --> 00:05:48.129 

so<00:05:46.009> after<00:05:46.520> our<00:05:46.669> cutting<00:05:47.060> that<00:05:47.330> part<00:05:47.660> off<00:05:47.840> on

00:05:48.129 --> 00:05:48.139 
so after our cutting that part off on

00:05:48.139 --> 00:05:52.210 
so after our cutting that part off on
the<00:05:48.800> 2<00:05:49.070> inch<00:05:49.400> by<00:05:49.880> 3<00:05:50.270> inch<00:05:50.320> piece<00:05:51.320> you<00:05:51.740> just<00:05:51.979> cut

00:05:52.210 --> 00:05:52.220 
the 2 inch by 3 inch piece you just cut

00:05:52.220 --> 00:05:55.510 
the 2 inch by 3 inch piece you just cut
from<00:05:52.910> one<00:05:52.970> corner<00:05:53.449> to<00:05:53.479> the<00:05:53.810> other<00:05:54.169> at<00:05:54.919> an<00:05:55.039> angle

00:05:55.510 --> 00:05:55.520 
from one corner to the other at an angle

00:05:55.520 --> 00:05:57.879 
from one corner to the other at an angle
it's<00:05:56.150> gonna<00:05:56.330> be<00:05:56.539> a<00:05:56.570> little<00:05:56.960> bit<00:05:57.139> taller<00:05:57.440> than

00:05:57.879 --> 00:05:57.889 
it's gonna be a little bit taller than

00:05:57.889 --> 00:06:00.460 
it's gonna be a little bit taller than
the<00:05:58.610> actual<00:05:58.970> display<00:05:59.509> so<00:05:59.900> you<00:05:59.930> cut<00:06:00.320> off<00:06:00.440> a

00:06:00.460 --> 00:06:00.470 
the actual display so you cut off a

00:06:00.470 --> 00:06:03.100 
the actual display so you cut off a
little<00:06:00.740> piece<00:06:00.860> and<00:06:01.340> then<00:06:01.940> make<00:06:02.240> sure<00:06:02.270> you<00:06:02.810> glue

00:06:03.100 --> 00:06:03.110 
little piece and then make sure you glue

00:06:03.110 --> 00:06:06.700 
little piece and then make sure you glue
that<00:06:03.650> onto<00:06:03.979> the<00:06:04.340> back<00:06:04.639> of<00:06:04.910> the<00:06:05.180> display<00:06:05.650> on<00:06:06.650> the

00:06:06.700 --> 00:06:06.710 
that onto the back of the display on the

00:06:06.710 --> 00:06:10.180 
that onto the back of the display on the
angle<00:06:07.580> side<00:06:07.940> and<00:06:08.300> not<00:06:08.419> the<00:06:08.479> straight<00:06:08.900> side<00:06:09.199> but

00:06:10.180 --> 00:06:10.190 
angle side and not the straight side but

00:06:10.190 --> 00:06:12.700 
angle side and not the straight side but
yeah<00:06:10.490> you<00:06:11.300> have<00:06:11.509> to<00:06:11.660> make<00:06:11.810> a<00:06:11.840> little<00:06:12.020> notch<00:06:12.350> in

chain in place now the rest of the chain

00:06:22.940 --> 00:06:25.689 
chain in place now the rest of the chain
though<00:06:23.180> it<00:06:23.419> has<00:06:23.630> to<00:06:24.110> be<00:06:24.800> taped<00:06:25.100> on<00:06:25.340> by<00:06:25.669> a

00:06:25.689 --> 00:06:25.699 
though it has to be taped on by a

00:06:25.699 --> 00:06:28.029 
though it has to be taped on by a
masking<00:06:26.180> tape<00:06:26.389> that's<00:06:26.630> all<00:06:26.750> I<00:06:26.870> used<00:06:27.169> and<00:06:27.470> it

00:06:28.029 --> 00:06:28.039 
masking tape that's all I used and it

00:06:28.039 --> 00:06:31.420 
masking tape that's all I used and it
wasn't<00:06:28.190> that<00:06:28.370> hard<00:06:28.610> don't<00:06:29.090> like<00:06:30.010> do<00:06:31.010> it<00:06:31.039> too

00:06:31.420 --> 00:06:31.430 
wasn't that hard don't like do it too

00:06:31.430 --> 00:06:33.250 
wasn't that hard don't like do it too
hard<00:06:31.699> to<00:06:31.820> where<00:06:31.970> it's<00:06:32.150> hard<00:06:32.419> hard<00:06:32.720> to<00:06:32.780> take<00:06:33.080> off

00:06:33.250 --> 00:06:33.260 
hard to where it's hard hard to take off

00:06:33.260 --> 00:06:36.129 
hard to where it's hard hard to take off
whenever<00:06:33.740> you<00:06:33.979> do<00:06:34.280> sell<00:06:34.580> it<00:06:34.760> but<00:06:35.449> yeah<00:06:36.110> I

00:06:36.129 --> 00:06:36.139 
whenever you do sell it but yeah I

00:06:36.139 --> 00:06:38.589 
whenever you do sell it but yeah I
worked<00:06:36.470> out<00:06:36.620> pretty<00:06:36.830> fine<00:06:37.099> for<00:06:37.430> me<00:06:37.580> and<00:06:37.789> the

00:06:38.589 --> 00:06:38.599 
worked out pretty fine for me and the

00:06:38.599 --> 00:06:40.480 
worked out pretty fine for me and the
only<00:06:38.690> thing<00:06:38.960> about<00:06:39.080> this<00:06:39.410> is<00:06:39.800> that<00:06:40.070> you<00:06:40.250> can't

00:06:40.480 --> 00:06:40.490 
only thing about this is that you can't

00:06:40.490 --> 00:06:44.200 
only thing about this is that you can't
put<00:06:40.729> like<00:06:41.000> a<00:06:41.330> beaded<00:06:41.780> chain<00:06:42.710> or<00:06:43.250> because<00:06:44.000> it's

00:06:44.200 --> 00:06:44.210 
put like a beaded chain or because it's

00:06:44.210 --> 00:06:45.939 
put like a beaded chain or because it's
too<00:06:44.449> small<00:06:44.780> but<00:06:45.169> if<00:06:45.320> you<00:06:45.349> make<00:06:45.590> a<00:06:45.620> bigger<00:06:45.860> one

00:06:45.939 --> 00:06:45.949 
too small but if you make a bigger one

00:06:45.949 --> 00:06:49.300 
too small but if you make a bigger one
I'm<00:06:46.340> sure<00:06:46.610> you<00:06:46.729> guys<00:06:46.910> can<00:06:47.620> if<00:06:48.620> you<00:06:48.830> guys<00:06:48.979> make

00:06:49.300 --> 00:06:49.310 
I'm sure you guys can if you guys make
