on<00:00:53.160> the<00:00:53.190> bottom<00:00:53.400> I<00:00:54.680> would<00:00:55.680> have<00:00:55.769> changed<00:00:56.040> him

00:00:56.299 --> 00:00:56.309 
on the bottom I would have changed him

00:00:56.309 --> 00:01:01.430 
on the bottom I would have changed him
up<00:00:56.960> and<00:00:57.960> I've<00:00:58.199> done<00:00:58.409> so<00:00:58.680> already<00:00:58.830> I<00:01:00.440> personally

00:01:01.430 --> 00:01:01.440 
up and I've done so already I personally

00:01:01.440 --> 00:01:05.950 
up and I've done so already I personally
would<00:01:01.559> have<00:01:01.650> made<00:01:01.799> all<00:01:02.040> of<00:01:02.070> this<00:01:02.309> grey<00:01:03.110> 3m<00:01:04.110> I

00:01:05.950 --> 00:01:05.960 
would have made all of this grey 3m I

00:01:05.960 --> 00:01:08.180 
would have made all of this grey 3m I
think<00:01:06.960> if<00:01:07.080> they<00:01:07.200> did<00:01:07.409> that<00:01:07.590> it<00:01:07.740> would<00:01:07.830> not<00:01:08.040> have

00:01:08.180 --> 00:01:08.190 
think if they did that it would not have

00:01:08.190 --> 00:01:11.149 
think if they did that it would not have
been<00:01:08.220> as<00:01:08.490> much<00:01:08.670> of<00:01:08.820> a<00:01:08.880> soft<00:01:09.180> release<00:01:09.890> and<00:01:10.890> a<00:01:11.010> lot

00:01:11.149 --> 00:01:11.159 
been as much of a soft release and a lot

00:01:11.159 --> 00:01:13.010 
been as much of a soft release and a lot
more<00:01:11.340> people<00:01:11.670> would<00:01:11.729> have<00:01:11.880> jumped<00:01:12.210> to<00:01:12.720> snap

00:01:13.010 --> 00:01:13.020 
more people would have jumped to snap

00:01:13.020 --> 00:01:16.640 
more people would have jumped to snap
them<00:01:13.170> up<00:01:13.290> also<00:01:14.780> the<00:01:15.780> white<00:01:16.020> lace<00:01:16.229> is<00:01:16.409> that<00:01:16.530> they

00:01:16.640 --> 00:01:16.650 
them up also the white lace is that they

00:01:16.650 --> 00:01:23.230 
them up also the white lace is that they
come<00:01:16.890> with<00:01:17.100> or<00:01:17.280> fine<00:01:19.189> but<00:01:20.189> I<00:01:20.220> believe<00:01:20.640> that

00:01:23.230 --> 00:01:23.240 

00:01:23.240 --> 00:01:26.480 

we're<00:01:24.240> too<00:01:24.479> much<00:01:24.659> into<00:01:25.200> white<00:01:26.070> and<00:01:26.280> black

00:01:26.480 --> 00:01:26.490 
we're too much into white and black

00:01:26.490 --> 00:01:31.069 
we're too much into white and black
laces<00:01:26.790> on<00:01:27.210> Jordans<00:01:28.399> not<00:01:29.399> enough<00:01:30.079> different

00:01:31.069 --> 00:01:31.079

colorways<00:01:31.619> I<00:01:32.359> chose<00:01:33.359> red<00:01:33.719> I<00:01:34.280> personally

00:01:35.270 --> 00:01:35.280 
colorways I chose red I personally

00:01:35.280 --> 00:01:37.190 
colorways I chose red I personally
believe<00:01:35.310> that<00:01:35.640> the<00:01:36.000> red<00:01:36.179> laces<00:01:36.420> change<00:01:36.960> the

00:01:37.190 --> 00:01:37.200 
believe that the red laces change the

00:01:37.200 --> 00:01:42.700 
believe that the red laces change the
look<00:01:37.350> tremendously<00:01:38.280> and<00:01:40.460> add<00:01:41.460> what<00:01:41.729> is<00:01:41.850> needed

00:01:42.700 --> 00:01:42.710 
look tremendously and add what is needed

00:01:42.710 --> 00:01:48.499 
look tremendously and add what is needed

00:02:01.350 --> 00:02:04.959 
of different lengths I've found 100 105
centimeters<00:02:02.280> and<00:02:02.810> 120<00:02:03.810> centimeters<00:02:04.049> so<00:02:04.590> far

00:02:04.959 --> 00:02:04.969 
centimeters and 120 centimeters so far

00:02:04.969 --> 00:02:09.440 
centimeters and 120 centimeters so far
these<00:02:05.969> are<00:02:06.179> the<00:02:06.240> 120s<00:02:07.580> the<00:02:08.580> same<00:02:08.850> laces<00:02:09.240> that<00:02:09.360> I

00:02:09.440 --> 00:02:09.450 
these are the 120s the same laces that I

00:02:09.450 --> 00:02:13.130 
these are the 120s the same laces that I
put<00:02:09.660> into<00:02:09.810> the<00:02:09.960> cement<00:02:10.319> 3s<00:02:11.810> because<00:02:12.810> I<00:02:12.840> just

00:02:13.130 --> 00:02:13.140 
put into the cement 3s because I just

00:02:13.140 --> 00:02:15.680 
put into the cement 3s because I just
believe<00:02:13.440> overall<00:02:13.950> that<00:02:14.190> that<00:02:14.850> red<00:02:15.180> brings<00:02:15.480> out

00:02:15.680 --> 00:02:15.690 
believe overall that that red brings out

00:02:15.690 --> 00:02:19.520 
believe overall that that red brings out
the<00:02:15.840> jumpman<00:02:17.540> works<00:02:18.540> better<00:02:18.900> on<00:02:18.990> that<00:02:19.110> black

00:02:19.520 --> 00:02:19.530 
the jumpman works better on that black

00:02:19.530 --> 00:02:23.630 
the jumpman works better on that black
tongue<00:02:21.350> brings<00:02:22.350> out<00:02:22.590> this<00:02:22.800> jumpman<00:02:23.340> a<00:02:23.370> little

00:02:23.630 --> 00:02:23.640 
tongue brings out this jumpman a little

00:02:23.640 --> 00:02:28.150 
tongue brings out this jumpman a little
better<00:02:23.850> and<00:02:24.060> the<00:02:24.900> overall<00:02:25.290> read<00:02:25.800> in<00:02:26.640> the<00:02:27.480> shoe

00:02:28.150 --> 00:02:28.160 
better and the overall read in the shoe

00:02:28.160 --> 00:02:32.210 
better and the overall read in the shoe
others<00:02:29.160> may<00:02:29.459> disagree<00:02:29.810> and<00:02:30.890> choose<00:02:31.890> to<00:02:32.069> say

00:02:32.210 --> 00:02:32.220

00:02:36.980 --> 00:02:36.990 
I believe that will also give these a

00:02:36.990 --> 00:02:39.220 
I believe that will also give these a
different<00:02:37.470> look

00:02:39.220 --> 00:02:39.230 
different look

00:02:39.230 --> 00:02:43.910 
different look
