00:02:29.060 --> 00:02:31.180 
ain't anal with your drawings just
getting<00:02:29.720> in<00:02:29.900> something<00:02:30.319> very<00:02:30.620> loose<00:02:30.950> like

00:02:31.180 --> 00:02:31.190 
getting in something very loose like

00:02:31.190 --> 00:02:32.270 
getting in something very loose like
this<00:02:31.220> and<00:02:31.610> just<00:02:31.700> scribble

00:02:32.270 --> 00:02:32.280 
this and just scribble

00:02:32.280 --> 00:02:34.340 
this and just scribble
in<00:02:32.340> your<00:02:32.700> tone<00:02:33.000> and<00:02:33.270> trying<00:02:33.870> to<00:02:33.990> think<00:02:34.260> very

00:02:34.340 --> 00:02:34.350 
in your tone and trying to think very

00:02:34.350 --> 00:02:37.460 
in your tone and trying to think very
very<00:02:35.000> cylindrical<00:02:36.000> okay<00:02:36.780> so<00:02:36.840> let's<00:02:37.290> do

00:02:37.460 --> 00:02:37.470 
very cylindrical okay so let's do

00:02:37.470 --> 00:02:38.900 
very cylindrical okay so let's do
another<00:02:37.590> one<00:02:37.890> now<00:02:38.100> let's<00:02:38.340> do<00:02:38.490> another<00:02:38.610> one

00:02:38.900 --> 00:02:38.910 
another one now let's do another one

00:02:38.910 --> 00:02:42.530 
another one now let's do another one
from<00:02:39.690> a<00:02:40.160> little<00:02:41.160> bit<00:02:41.340> from<00:02:41.490> up<00:02:41.730> above<00:02:41.910> so<00:02:42.360> now

00:02:42.530 --> 00:02:42.540 
from a little bit from up above so now

00:02:42.540 --> 00:02:45.680 
from a little bit from up above so now
let's<00:02:43.200> that's<00:02:43.590> our<00:02:43.800> first<00:02:44.010> oval<00:02:44.520> alright<00:02:45.390> and

00:02:45.680 --> 00:02:45.690 
let's that's our first oval alright and

00:02:45.690 --> 00:02:47.480 
let's that's our first oval alright and
so<00:02:45.750> our<00:02:46.200> second<00:02:46.830> novel<00:02:46.920> is<00:02:47.190> going<00:02:47.310> to<00:02:47.370> be

00:02:47.480 --> 00:02:47.490 
so our second novel is going to be

00:02:47.490 --> 00:02:50.030 
so our second novel is going to be
somewhat<00:02:48.120> semi<00:02:48.569> foreshortened<00:02:49.290> and<00:02:49.470> this

00:02:50.030 --> 00:02:50.040 
somewhat semi foreshortened and this

00:02:50.040 --> 00:02:52.370 
somewhat semi foreshortened and this
second<00:02:50.430> oval<00:02:50.760> almost<00:02:51.150> becomes<00:02:51.540> like<00:02:51.660> a<00:02:51.780> circle

00:02:52.370 --> 00:02:52.380 
second oval almost becomes like a circle

00:02:52.380 --> 00:02:57.110 
second oval almost becomes like a circle
so<00:02:53.130> now<00:02:53.310> we<00:02:53.370> would<00:02:53.730> find<00:02:54.090> our<00:02:56.120> vertical

00:02:57.110 --> 00:02:57.120 
so now we would find our vertical

00:02:57.120 --> 00:02:59.510 
so now we would find our vertical
centerline<00:02:57.739> okay<00:02:58.739> then<00:02:59.010> we<00:02:59.130> would<00:02:59.250> wrap

00:02:59.510 --> 00:02:59.520 
centerline okay then we would wrap

00:02:59.520 --> 00:03:03.110 
centerline okay then we would wrap
around<00:03:00.590> very<00:03:01.590> fluid<00:03:02.190> like<00:03:02.340> this<00:03:02.550> scribble<00:03:02.910> in

00:03:03.110 --> 00:03:03.120 
around very fluid like this scribble in

00:03:03.120 --> 00:03:04.759 
around very fluid like this scribble in
your<00:03:03.270> sketchbook<00:03:03.810> is<00:03:03.930> very<00:03:04.170> important<00:03:04.560> to<00:03:04.590> do

00:03:04.759 --> 00:03:04.769 
your sketchbook is very important to do

00:03:04.769 --> 00:03:06.920 
your sketchbook is very important to do
these<00:03:04.980> very<00:03:05.220> loose<00:03:05.970> things<00:03:06.269> in<00:03:06.420> your<00:03:06.510> schedule

00:03:06.920 --> 00:03:06.930 
these very loose things in your schedule

00:03:06.930 --> 00:03:09.380 
these very loose things in your schedule
especially<00:03:07.650> from<00:03:07.860> memory<00:03:08.190> drawing<00:03:08.459> and<00:03:08.730> so

00:03:09.380 --> 00:03:09.390 
especially from memory drawing and so

00:03:09.390 --> 00:03:11.330 
especially from memory drawing and so
now<00:03:09.690> I've<00:03:10.110> established<00:03:10.290> all<00:03:10.860> this<00:03:11.070> so<00:03:11.190> now

00:03:11.330 --> 00:03:11.340 
now I've established all this so now

00:03:11.340 --> 00:03:14.570 
now I've established all this so now
this<00:03:11.580> first<00:03:12.620> oval<00:03:13.620> is<00:03:13.890> going<00:03:14.070> to<00:03:14.130> be<00:03:14.340> our

00:03:14.570 --> 00:03:14.580 
this first oval is going to be our

00:03:14.580 --> 00:03:17.330 
this first oval is going to be our
jawline<00:03:15.290> so<00:03:16.290> since<00:03:16.620> we're<00:03:16.830> looking<00:03:17.100> at<00:03:17.190> this

00:03:17.330 --> 00:03:17.340 
jawline so since we're looking at this

00:03:17.340 --> 00:03:21.410 
jawline so since we're looking at this
from<00:03:17.580> below<00:03:19.430> we're<00:03:20.430> going<00:03:20.519> to<00:03:20.610> wrap<00:03:20.850> our<00:03:21.120> jaw

00:03:21.410 --> 00:03:21.420 
from below we're going to wrap our jaw

00:03:21.420 --> 00:03:26.000 
from below we're going to wrap our jaw
around<00:03:23.780> this<00:03:24.780> is<00:03:24.959> the<00:03:25.110> top<00:03:25.380> of<00:03:25.530> my<00:03:25.680> forehead

00:03:26.000 --> 00:03:26.010 
around this is the top of my forehead

00:03:26.010 --> 00:03:29.870 
around this is the top of my forehead
forehead<00:03:26.700> I<00:03:27.200> socket<00:03:28.200> area<00:03:28.459> jawbone<00:03:29.459> wrap

00:03:29.870 --> 00:03:29.880 
forehead I socket area jawbone wrap

00:03:29.880 --> 00:03:32.960 
forehead I socket area jawbone wrap
around<00:03:30.380> back<00:03:31.380> of<00:03:31.620> my<00:03:31.800> skull<00:03:32.160> so<00:03:32.489> now<00:03:32.640> let's

00:03:32.960 --> 00:03:32.970 
around back of my skull so now let's

00:03:32.970 --> 00:03:35.750 
around back of my skull so now let's
just<00:03:33.209> do<00:03:33.450> very<00:03:34.290> quickly<00:03:34.380> here<00:03:35.160> let's<00:03:35.400> just<00:03:35.610> get

just do very quickly here let's just get

00:03:35.760 --> 00:03:38.120 
just do very quickly here let's just get
in<00:03:35.940> or<00:03:36.120> formula<00:03:36.720> no<00:03:36.930> formula<00:03:37.470> is<00:03:37.590> this<00:03:37.890> lines

00:03:44.330 --> 00:03:44.340 
it's this is just a starting point for

00:03:44.340 --> 00:03:46.610 
it's this is just a starting point for
you<00:03:44.519> for<00:03:44.940> facing<00:03:45.720> a<00:03:45.810> white<00:03:46.019> blank<00:03:46.320> sheet<00:03:46.590> of

00:03:56.509 --> 00:03:56.519 
let's just wrap around let's just have

00:03:56.519 --> 00:04:00.140 
let's just wrap around let's just have
fun<00:03:56.549> with<00:03:56.970> this<00:03:57.150> wrap<00:03:57.510> around<00:03:57.900> and<00:03:58.940> now<00:03:59.940> let's
