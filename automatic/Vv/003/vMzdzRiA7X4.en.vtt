00:00:22.510 --> 00:00:22.520 
of the sims 3 into the future so in

00:00:22.520 --> 00:00:24.430 
of the sims 3 into the future so in
terms<00:00:22.700> of<00:00:22.910> what<00:00:23.060> we<00:00:23.240> do<00:00:23.510> in<00:00:23.720> terms<00:00:23.750> of<00:00:24.020> our<00:00:24.170> prep

00:00:24.430 --> 00:00:24.440 
terms of what we do in terms of our prep

00:00:24.440 --> 00:00:26.859 
terms of what we do in terms of our prep
is<00:00:24.619> that<00:00:24.800> will<00:00:24.949> first<00:00:25.250> get<00:00:26.180> an<00:00:26.330> image<00:00:26.480> of<00:00:26.780> the

00:00:26.859 --> 00:00:26.869 
is that will first get an image of the

00:00:26.869 --> 00:00:27.939 
is that will first get an image of the
look<00:00:27.020> that<00:00:27.050> we're<00:00:27.260> going<00:00:27.410> to<00:00:27.500> create<00:00:27.680> and

00:00:27.939 --> 00:00:27.949 
look that we're going to create and

00:00:27.949 --> 00:00:29.380 
look that we're going to create and
obviously<00:00:28.220> what<00:00:28.369> we<00:00:28.520> want<00:00:28.699> to<00:00:28.789> create<00:00:29.029> is

00:00:29.380 --> 00:00:29.390 
obviously what we want to create is

00:00:29.390 --> 00:00:32.409 
obviously what we want to create is
design<00:00:30.140> into<00:00:30.380> a<00:00:30.440> real-life<00:00:30.830> sim<00:00:31.100> so<00:00:31.820> we'll<00:00:32.029> map

00:00:32.409 --> 00:00:32.419 
design into a real-life sim so we'll map

00:00:32.419 --> 00:00:34.660 
design into a real-life sim so we'll map
page<00:00:32.660> with<00:00:32.989> masking<00:00:33.440> tape<00:00:33.469> and<00:00:34.100> then<00:00:34.550> we'll

00:00:34.660 --> 00:00:34.670 
page with masking tape and then we'll

00:00:34.670 --> 00:00:36.490 
page with masking tape and then we'll
come<00:00:34.789> in<00:00:34.879> with<00:00:34.940> our<00:00:35.090> water-based<00:00:35.840> colors<00:00:36.199> so

00:00:36.490 --> 00:00:36.500 
come in with our water-based colors so

00:00:36.500 --> 00:00:38.020 
come in with our water-based colors so
that<00:00:36.530> there's<00:00:36.859> four<00:00:37.129> body<00:00:37.309> painters<00:00:37.699> there's

00:00:41.349 --> 00:00:41.359 
which is tricky the eye so it does the

00:00:41.359 --> 00:00:42.669 
which is tricky the eye so it does the
tricks<00:00:41.600> your<00:00:41.780> eye<00:00:41.809> and<00:00:42.050> you're<00:00:42.140> looking<00:00:42.409> at<00:00:42.499> it

00:00:49.850 --> 00:00:52.090 
looking forward to it I've been turned
into<00:00:50.149> a<00:00:50.239> real-life<00:00:50.659> sin<00:00:51.049> so<00:00:51.769> going<00:00:51.920> to<00:00:51.979> look

00:00:52.090 --> 00:00:52.100 
into a real-life sin so going to look

00:00:52.100 --> 00:00:54.520 
into a real-life sin so going to look
like<00:00:52.280> a<00:00:52.309> robot<00:00:52.549> so<00:00:53.089> I'm<00:00:53.600> very<00:00:53.960> very<00:00:54.229> eager<00:00:54.319> to
