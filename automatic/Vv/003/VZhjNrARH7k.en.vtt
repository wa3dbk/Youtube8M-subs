 Hi, I'm Javier Slim and I'm 

00:00:02.370 --> 00:00:06.779
 selling this survival gadget 

00:00:04.759 --> 00:00:09.780
 that really caught my attention 

00:00:06.779 --> 00:00:13.079
 lately and I'm going to explain 

00:00:09.780 --> 00:00:15.299
 the good as you can see has a 

00:00:13.079 --> 00:00:16.920
 strap to carry in your hand a 

00:00:15.299 --> 00:00:19.340
 thermometer for the temperature and a 

00:00:16.920 --> 00:00:22.190
 Hydro meter for humidity 

00:00:19.340 --> 00:00:24.619
 in the inside we have a mirror 

00:00:22.190 --> 00:00:27.770
 that can be used to signal us 

00:00:24.619 --> 00:00:28.939
 during the day with the sun or to shave 

00:00:27.770 --> 00:00:31.520
 For example, we need 

00:00:28.939 --> 00:00:34.720
 look at us somewhere 

00:00:31.520 --> 00:00:34.720
 we have a magnifying glass 

00:00:34.790 --> 00:00:43.390
 with a small ruler and inside too 

00:00:38.000 --> 00:00:43.390
 as you can see a spirit level 

00:00:43.620 --> 00:00:47.059
 the compass is of great quality 

00:00:47.450 --> 00:00:52.550
 that we can see it above but 

00:00:50.240 --> 00:00:54.530
 also when it is closed we can 

00:00:52.550 --> 00:00:56.870
 see it on the side in such a way that 

00:00:54.530 --> 00:00:59.120
 without opening it if we know the address 

00:00:56.870 --> 00:01:02.490
 we have to keep looking here 

00:00:59.120 --> 00:01:05.160
 we could guide 

00:01:02.490 --> 00:01:07.590
 line is here along with 

00:01:05.160 --> 00:01:10.790
 notch of the tip can also serve 

00:01:07.590 --> 00:01:13.790
 to delimit fixed points in the 

00:01:10.790 --> 00:01:13.790
 ground 

00:01:14.050 --> 00:01:19.490
 to use the map and get oriented and more 

00:01:17.140 --> 00:01:23.619
 things that he has 

00:01:19.490 --> 00:01:23.619
 has a led bulb 

00:01:27.310 --> 00:01:32.590
 putting the 

00:01:29.380 --> 00:01:34.860
 the stick is on the side we can 

00:01:32.590 --> 00:01:34.860
 take 

00:01:34.980 --> 00:01:40.130
 up to three things that has cost me 

00:01:37.560 --> 00:01:43.899
 cash team discover that they were 

00:01:40.130 --> 00:01:43.899
 this is a whistle 

00:01:46.659 --> 00:01:51.420
 It's all so little that I did not know why 

00:01:49.600 --> 00:01:54.680
 what it was 

00:01:51.420 --> 00:01:54.680

00:02:00.530 --> 00:02:04.880
