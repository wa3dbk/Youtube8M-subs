00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.720
 for almost a whole year after 

00:00:02.340 --> 00:00:08.550
 coup in Ukraine 

00:00:03.720 --> 00:00:10.349
 hut obama said the following each 

00:00:08.550 --> 00:00:14.809
 the nation has the right to decide its own 

00:00:10.349 --> 00:00:17.060
 fate and the people of Ukraine is no exception 

00:00:14.809 --> 00:00:21.119
 Ukrainians boldly defended 

00:00:17.060 --> 00:00:23.939
 democracy but Ukrainians themselves take 

00:00:21.119 --> 00:00:25.769
 decision affecting their lives in the end 

00:00:23.939 --> 00:00:29.210
 expression of the people of Ukraine own 

00:00:25.769 --> 00:00:29.210
 the will turned into something terrible 

00:00:45.410 --> 00:00:50.250
 in an interview with cnn president 

00:00:48.450 --> 00:00:54.510
 Obama discussed the reaction of Russia to 

00:00:50.250 --> 00:00:56.490
 Ukrainian bloodshed Mr Putin 

00:00:54.510 --> 00:00:58.320
 made a decision regarding the Crimea and 

00:00:56.490 --> 00:01:00.960
 Ukraine not because he had 

00:00:58.320 --> 00:01:03.059
 some great strategy but in fact because 

00:01:00.960 --> 00:01:03.660
 that he was taken by surprise by the protests 

00:01:03.059 --> 00:01:06.030
 Maidan 

00:01:03.660 --> 00:01:08.130
 as well as Yanukovych's flight after 

00:01:06.030 --> 00:01:10.729
 we mediated the transition 

00:01:08.130 --> 00:01:10.729
 authorities in Ukraine 

00:01:11.119 --> 00:01:15.899
 thus the decision of the Ukrainian people 

00:01:13.860 --> 00:01:18.270
 express your will yet preceded 

00:01:15.899 --> 00:01:19.829
 directing push from washington and though 

00:01:18.270 --> 00:01:22.110
 last February in negotiations between 

00:01:19.829 --> 00:01:23.880
 former president of the country and the opposition 

00:01:22.110 --> 00:01:25.979
 it was decided to politically 

00:01:23.880 --> 00:01:27.390
 conflict resolution is all over 

00:01:25.979 --> 00:01:29.700
 violent change of power 

00:01:27.390 --> 00:01:31.829
 daniel macadams from ron sex institute 

00:01:29.700 --> 00:01:36.509
 Believes Obama Recognition Sheds 

00:01:31.829 --> 00:01:38.340
 light on the causes of what happened think in 

00:01:36.509 --> 00:01:40.799
 first, it shows that 

00:01:38.340 --> 00:01:42.959
 the president is confused when he testifies 

00:01:40.799 --> 00:01:45.030
 made this statement for sure many in 

00:01:42.959 --> 00:01:47.250
 State Department clutched at heart 

00:01:45.030 --> 00:01:49.259
 but I wonder if it can be so 

00:01:47.250 --> 00:01:51.959
 at another unknown level 

00:01:49.259 --> 00:01:54.509
 President Obama and the State Department and in 

00:01:51.959 --> 00:01:56.280
 actually mystery mediated in 

00:01:54.509 --> 00:01:58.590
 while the European Union was engaged 

00:01:56.280 --> 00:02:00.780
 negotiations with Yanukovych on the transfer 

00:01:58.590 --> 00:02:03.270
 presidential power events of that night 

00:02:00.780 --> 00:02:04.590
 remain a mystery everyone went to sleep 

00:02:03.270 --> 00:02:06.810
 with the thought that was achieved 

00:02:04.590 --> 00:02:08.700
 non- violence agreement 

00:02:06.810 --> 00:02:09.360
 which subsequently failed 

00:02:08.700 --> 00:02:12.000
 to avoid 

00:02:09.360 --> 00:02:15.120
 in the morning we woke up and found out that the power 

00:02:12.000 --> 00:02:17.250
 captured people close to the us 

00:02:15.120 --> 00:02:20.359
 Obama's statement more truth than him 

00:02:17.250 --> 00:02:20.359
 I would like to myself 

00:02:21.330 --> 00:02:25.560
 after the change of power, Kiev was drawn into 

00:02:23.760 --> 00:02:27.930
 bloody conflict with those who do not 

00:02:25.560 --> 00:02:30.300
 pleased with the new regime in the us continue 

00:02:27.930 --> 00:02:31.860
 provide support to Kiev by providing 

00:02:30.300 --> 00:02:33.990
 loans for war victims 

00:02:31.860 --> 00:02:35.910
 national economy and non-lethal 

00:02:33.990 --> 00:02:37.650
 military aid is now america 

00:02:35.910 --> 00:02:39.780
 is considering the possibility of supplies to 

00:02:37.650 --> 00:02:41.160
 Ukraine weapons however last 

00:02:39.780 --> 00:02:43.560
 peace talks with us not 

00:02:41.160 --> 00:02:45.840
 attended by danila macadams 

00:02:43.560 --> 00:02:51.150
 and this once again shows what goals 

00:02:45.840 --> 00:02:53.310
 washington pursues in Ukraine we already 

00:02:51.150 --> 00:02:55.680
 more than ten years forced to listen to this 

00:02:53.310 --> 00:02:56.940
 nonsense in the United States declare that orange 

00:02:55.680 --> 00:02:59.640
 revolution was triggered by desire 

00:02:56.940 --> 00:03:02.100
 Ukrainians live better of course in each 

00:02:59.640 --> 00:03:04.440
 color revolution are involved first those 

00:03:02.100 --> 00:03:07.140
 who is really looking for a better life and 

00:03:04.440 --> 00:03:09.600
 who is not looking and secondly those who believe 

00:03:07.140 --> 00:03:11.820
 Western propaganda persuasive if you 

00:03:09.600 --> 00:03:13.830
 do so who will live like in 

00:03:11.820 --> 00:03:16.290
 Switzerland is happy and rich 

00:03:13.830 --> 00:03:18.300
 it always happens however 

00:03:16.290 --> 00:03:20.550
 business washington pours into ukraine 

00:03:18.300 --> 00:03:23.340
 billion dollars we all remember the words 

00:03:20.550 --> 00:03:25.410
 Victoria Nuland about the fact that the United States invested 5 

00:03:23.340 --> 00:03:28.019
 billion dollar support for democracy 

00:03:25.410 --> 00:03:30.720
 in Ukraine there is no doubt that orange 

00:03:28.019 --> 00:03:32.730
 financed us a victorian usa 

00:03:30.720 --> 00:03:36.830
 wlan and the State Department played a big 

00:03:32.730 --> 00:03:36.830
 role in the recent change of power in Ukraine
