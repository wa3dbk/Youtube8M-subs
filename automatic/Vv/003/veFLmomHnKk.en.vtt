hi this is just a short video clip of
the<00:00:04.529> Martin<00:00:04.859> DM<00:00:05.190> that<00:00:05.490> I<00:00:05.520> currently<00:00:05.970> have

00:00:06.200 --> 00:00:06.210 
the Martin DM that I currently have

00:00:06.210 --> 00:00:10.430 
the Martin DM that I currently have
listed<00:00:06.990> on<00:00:07.200> eBay<00:00:07.890> and<00:00:08.719> just<00:00:09.719> recorded<00:00:10.170> with<00:00:10.290> my

00:00:10.430 --> 00:00:10.440 
listed on eBay and just recorded with my

00:00:10.440 --> 00:00:12.499 
listed on eBay and just recorded with my
webcam<00:00:10.860> so<00:00:11.160> don't<00:00:11.340> agree<00:00:11.639> the<00:00:11.820> same<00:00:12.030> quality

00:00:12.499 --> 00:00:12.509 
webcam so don't agree the same quality

00:00:12.509 --> 00:00:14.780 
webcam so don't agree the same quality
to<00:00:12.630> be<00:00:12.809> but<00:00:13.080> hopefully<00:00:13.280> there<00:00:14.280> could<00:00:14.519> be<00:00:14.549> some

00:00:14.780 --> 00:00:14.790 
to be but hopefully there could be some

00:00:14.790 --> 00:00:16.910 
to be but hopefully there could be some
idea<00:00:15.150> of<00:00:15.210> what<00:00:15.990> the<00:00:16.109> instrument<00:00:16.350> sounds<00:00:16.770> like

00:00:16.910 --> 00:00:16.920 
idea of what the instrument sounds like

00:00:16.920 --> 00:00:20.179 
idea of what the instrument sounds like
and<00:00:17.930> just<00:00:18.930> adjust<00:00:19.109> the<00:00:19.410> camera<00:00:19.770> so<00:00:19.920> you<00:00:19.949> can

00:00:20.179 --> 00:00:20.189 
and just adjust the camera so you can

00:00:20.189 --> 00:00:21.650 
and just adjust the camera so you can
see<00:00:20.340> a<00:00:20.369> bit<00:00:20.550> more<00:00:20.580> than<00:00:20.820> the<00:00:20.910> guitar<00:00:21.210> and<00:00:21.449> the

00:00:21.650 --> 00:00:21.660
