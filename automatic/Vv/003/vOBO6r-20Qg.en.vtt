00:00:07.640 --> 00:00:11.910
 a single bath can span seven 

00:00:10.350 --> 00:00:14.420
 kilometers long and one kilometer and 

00:00:11.910 --> 00:00:16.710
 half wide and 30 meters deep 

00:00:14.420 --> 00:00:26.400
 it is made up of hundreds of 

00:00:16.710 --> 00:00:28.140
 millions of fish all sardines 

00:00:26.400 --> 00:00:30.839
 from South Africa do not undertake this 

00:00:28.140 --> 00:00:32.220
 long journey but those who risk it 

00:00:30.839 --> 00:00:34.289
 that allows us to attend one of 

00:00:32.220 --> 00:00:46.170
 highest shows in the world at 

00:00:34.289 --> 00:00:47.149
 side the security officials 

00:00:46.170 --> 00:00:49.140
 flies over the area 

00:00:47.149 --> 00:00:51.149
 not that they worry about 

00:00:49.140 --> 00:00:52.620
 sardines but because of 

00:00:51.149 --> 00:00:55.109
 sharks have been arranged around 

00:00:52.620 --> 00:00:56.760
 beaches to protect swimmers if he 

00:00:55.109 --> 00:00:57.480
 see sardines in the water 

00:00:56.760 --> 00:00:59.460
 deep 

00:00:57.480 --> 00:01:01.530
 the nets must then be raised to 

00:00:59.460 --> 00:01:03.329
 that sharks and dolphins come to 

00:01:01.530 --> 00:01:05.660
 feed on the bench are not taken 

00:01:03.329 --> 00:01:05.660
 in the trap 

00:01:06.540 --> 00:01:10.630
 when predators start doing 

00:01:08.799 --> 00:01:12.200
 feasting scientists are them 

00:01:10.630 --> 00:01:14.090
 also at the party 

00:01:12.200 --> 00:01:16.100
 because it's the only place in the world where 

00:01:14.090 --> 00:01:19.360
 they can observe as close to 

00:01:16.100 --> 00:01:19.360
 shore such a phenomenon 

00:01:19.600 --> 00:01:24.649
 along the coast 

00:01:21.439 --> 00:01:25.640
 others are waiting their turn like 

00:01:24.649 --> 00:01:27.799
 crazy about the cape 

00:01:25.640 --> 00:01:29.569
 it's powerful two seabird 

00:01:27.799 --> 00:01:31.549
 span meters can cover more 

00:01:29.569 --> 00:01:35.119
 400 kilometers a day to find 

00:01:31.549 --> 00:01:37.909
 food 60 times the way 

00:01:35.119 --> 00:01:38.780
 daily average of an English but to 

00:01:37.909 --> 00:01:42.880
 this time of the year 

00:01:38.780 --> 00:01:42.880
 they do not have to go far 

00:01:54.100 --> 00:01:58.460
 the schools of fish are so numerous 

00:01:56.570 --> 00:02:00.860
 and so important that they are enough to 

00:01:58.460 --> 00:02:02.560
 please all the crazy people 

00:02:00.860 --> 00:02:04.670
 cape 

00:02:02.560 --> 00:02:06.890
 with binocular vision 

00:02:04.670 --> 00:02:10.190
 the cape fool accurately assess the 

00:02:06.890 --> 00:02:12.740
 distances after spotting his target 

00:02:10.190 --> 00:02:15.460
 they dive in a dive of 30 m 2 or so 

00:02:12.740 --> 00:02:15.460
 a bomber 

00:02:21.000 --> 00:02:30.090
 he falls in free fall rp clp missiles 

00:02:25.360 --> 00:02:30.090
 aerodynamic that suddenly make the waves 

00:02:40.710 --> 00:02:45.450
 this kind of impact could kill a man 

00:02:43.070 --> 00:02:47.130
 but the cape crazy has bags 

00:02:45.450 --> 00:02:49.800
 air on the head and chest that 

00:02:47.130 --> 00:02:50.790
 cushion the shaq and as it does not 

00:02:49.800 --> 00:02:53.720
 external nostrils 

00:02:50.790 --> 00:02:53.720
 he did not know about padua 

00:02:59.920 --> 00:03:03.740
 Cape fools are able to dive 

00:03:02.360 --> 00:03:05.900
 at 10 meters depth 

00:03:03.740 --> 00:03:08.200
 a great feat for a bird out of 

00:03:05.900 --> 00:03:08.200
 its element 

00:03:11.660 --> 00:03:16.520
 he catches the fish when diving or 

00:03:13.850 --> 00:03:18.950
 going up the piercing with a sharp jerk 

00:03:16.520 --> 00:03:20.450
 with their serrated beaks all 

00:03:18.950 --> 00:03:22.100
 goes so fast that the catch is often 

00:03:20.450 --> 00:03:24.610
 engulfed even before the bird is 

00:03:22.100 --> 00:03:24.610
 resurfaced
