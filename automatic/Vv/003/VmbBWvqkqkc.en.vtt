I actually put an edge on this thing and

00:03:12.840 --> 00:03:15.650 
I actually put an edge on this thing and
this<00:03:13.680> was<00:03:13.890> this<00:03:14.340> was<00:03:14.519> like<00:03:14.730> 9<00:03:14.940> bucks<00:03:14.970> at<00:03:15.600> Target

00:03:19.769 --> 00:03:21.620 
so I have to say it was a good buy and
of<00:03:20.220> course<00:03:20.400> that<00:03:20.550> sheath<00:03:20.790> will<00:03:21.000> go<00:03:21.090> into<00:03:21.360> his

00:03:21.620 --> 00:03:21.630 
of course that sheath will go into his

00:03:21.630 --> 00:03:26.030 
of course that sheath will go into his
back<00:03:21.930> at<00:03:22.380> this<00:03:22.800> peg<00:03:23.130> and<00:03:23.430> you<00:03:24.620> can't<00:03:25.620> store<00:03:25.860> the

00:03:26.030 --> 00:03:26.040 
back at this peg and you can't store the

00:03:26.040 --> 00:03:31.070 
back at this peg and you can't store the
sword<00:03:26.280> in<00:03:26.550> there<00:03:26.780> very<00:03:27.780> comfortably<00:03:29.900> the<00:03:30.900> only

00:03:31.070 --> 00:03:31.080 
sword in there very comfortably the only

00:03:31.080 --> 00:03:32.479 
sword in there very comfortably the only
thing<00:03:31.200> is<00:03:31.320> it<00:03:31.530> kind<00:03:31.769> of<00:03:31.860> hinders<00:03:32.010> his<00:03:32.160> head

00:03:32.479 --> 00:03:32.489 
thing is it kind of hinders his head

00:03:32.489 --> 00:03:34.130 
thing is it kind of hinders his head
articulation<00:03:33.030> because<00:03:33.299> this<00:03:33.450> hat<00:03:33.660> is<00:03:33.959> like

00:03:34.130 --> 00:03:34.140
