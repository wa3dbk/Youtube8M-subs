we<00:00:05.180> should<00:00:05.390> start<00:00:05.660> this<00:00:05.810> experiment<00:00:06.170> by

00:00:06.490 --> 00:00:06.500 
we should start this experiment by

00:00:06.500 --> 00:00:08.170 
we should start this experiment by
defining<00:00:06.830> some<00:00:07.010> terms<00:00:07.189> that<00:00:07.609> we<00:00:07.760> have<00:00:07.790> learned

00:00:08.170 --> 00:00:08.180 
defining some terms that we have learned

00:00:08.180 --> 00:00:10.870 
defining some terms that we have learned
the<00:00:08.840> first<00:00:09.050> is<00:00:09.290> diffusion<00:00:09.740> diffusion<00:00:10.610> is

00:00:10.870 --> 00:00:10.880 
the first is diffusion diffusion is

00:00:10.880 --> 00:00:12.070 
the first is diffusion diffusion is
known<00:00:11.030> as<00:00:11.210> the<00:00:11.330> random<00:00:11.540> movement<00:00:11.990> of

00:00:12.070 --> 00:00:12.080 
known as the random movement of

known as the random movement of
molecules<00:00:12.200> in<00:00:12.799> this<00:00:13.070> case<00:00:13.339> water<00:00:13.610> molecules

00:00:14.199 --> 00:00:14.209 
molecules in this case water molecules

00:00:14.209 --> 00:00:16.450 
molecules in this case water molecules
from<00:00:14.719> a<00:00:14.839> region<00:00:15.139> of<00:00:15.230> higher<00:00:15.440> concentration<00:00:15.469> to

00:00:16.450 --> 00:00:16.460 
from a region of higher concentration to

00:00:16.460 --> 00:00:19.240 
from a region of higher concentration to
one<00:00:16.670> of<00:00:16.820> a<00:00:16.910> lower<00:00:17.090> concentration<00:00:17.920> the<00:00:18.920> next

00:00:19.240 --> 00:00:19.250 
one of a lower concentration the next

00:00:19.250 --> 00:00:21.370 
one of a lower concentration the next
term<00:00:19.430> is<00:00:19.610> osmosis<00:00:20.060> which<00:00:20.510> is<00:00:20.720> the<00:00:20.869> purpose<00:00:21.230> of

to<00:01:49.490> measure<00:01:49.729> its<00:01:50.060> width<00:01:50.359> and<00:01:50.799> you're<00:01:51.799> going<00:01:52.069> to

00:01:52.270 --> 00:01:52.280 
to measure its width and you're going to

00:01:52.280 --> 00:01:54.789 
to measure its width and you're going to
measure<00:01:52.490> it<00:01:52.729> tight<00:01:52.999> you<00:01:53.299> are<00:01:54.170> then<00:01:54.409> going<00:01:54.679> to

00:01:54.789 --> 00:01:54.799 
measure it tight you are then going to

00:01:54.799 --> 00:01:56.770 
measure it tight you are then going to
do<00:01:55.100> the<00:01:55.219> same<00:01:55.490> for<00:01:55.520> all<00:01:55.939> three<00:01:55.969> gummy<00:01:56.479> bears

00:02:59.280 --> 00:03:00.949 
data as shown you should be able to see
a<00:02:59.310> drastic<00:02:59.879> difference<00:03:00.030> between<00:03:00.599> the<00:03:00.750> gummy

00:03:00.949 --> 00:03:00.959 
a drastic difference between the gummy

00:03:00.959 --> 00:03:02.900 
a drastic difference between the gummy
bears<00:03:01.230> before<00:03:01.440> and<00:03:01.980> after<00:03:02.400> they<00:03:02.549> were<00:03:02.610> put

bears before and after they were put

00:03:02.910 --> 00:03:05.420 
bears before and after they were put
into<00:03:03.060> the<00:03:03.299> tap<00:03:03.510> water<00:03:03.690> through<00:03:04.650> osmosis<00:03:04.829> the

00:03:05.420 --> 00:03:05.430 
into the tap water through osmosis the

00:03:05.430 --> 00:03:07.520 
into the tap water through osmosis the
tap<00:03:05.640> water<00:03:05.879> that<00:03:06.209> originally<00:03:06.810> was<00:03:06.930> outside<00:03:07.409> of

00:03:07.520 --> 00:03:07.530 
tap water that originally was outside of

00:03:07.530 --> 00:03:09.170 
tap water that originally was outside of
the<00:03:07.650> gummy<00:03:07.860> bear<00:03:08.159> traveled<00:03:08.790> through<00:03:09.030> the

00:03:09.170 --> 00:03:09.180 
the gummy bear traveled through the

00:03:09.180 --> 00:03:11.660 
the gummy bear traveled through the
semipermeable<00:03:09.560> membrane<00:03:10.560> of<00:03:10.709> the<00:03:11.160> gummy<00:03:11.370> bear

00:03:11.660 --> 00:03:11.670 
semipermeable membrane of the gummy bear

00:03:11.670 --> 00:03:14.000 
semipermeable membrane of the gummy bear
this<00:03:12.239> is<00:03:12.510> what<00:03:12.780> caused<00:03:13.049> the<00:03:13.319> gummy<00:03:13.530> bear<00:03:13.769> to

00:03:14.000 --> 00:03:14.010 
this is what caused the gummy bear to

00:03:14.010 --> 00:03:16.030 
this is what caused the gummy bear to
grow

00:03:16.030 --> 00:03:16.040 
grow

00:03:16.040 --> 00:03:18.830 
grow
now<00:03:17.040> that<00:03:17.280> the<00:03:17.400> experiment<00:03:18.030> is<00:03:18.090> done<00:03:18.330> I<00:03:18.569> hope

00:03:18.830 --> 00:03:18.840 
now that the experiment is done I hope

00:03:18.840 --> 00:03:19.670 
now that the experiment is done I hope
that<00:03:19.020> you<00:03:19.080> have<00:03:19.200> a<00:03:19.230> complete<00:03:19.650> understanding

00:03:19.670 --> 00:03:19.680 
that you have a complete understanding

00:03:19.680 --> 00:03:24.440 
that you have a complete understanding
of<00:03:20.490> what<00:03:20.760> osmosis<00:03:21.209> is<00:03:21.510> and<00:03:21.750> how<00:03:21.990> it<00:03:22.200> works
