00:00:21.789 --> 00:00:27.720
 Now all bacteria are on tour 

00:00:24.430 --> 00:00:27.720
 Now we take a sample for the lab 

00:00:43.720 --> 00:00:48.090
 fast lab so that the sample may 

00:00:45.790 --> 00:00:48.090
 no more 

00:00:50.330 --> 00:00:58.490
 That's what you have to show is regulation 

00:00:52.700 --> 00:00:58.490
 ok, well 

00:01:21.530 --> 00:01:25.810
 here we have to value the exact ph 

00:01:23.150 --> 00:01:30.229
 the value should always be so between 

00:01:25.810 --> 00:01:30.740
 66 and 68 are otherwise the milk to 

00:01:30.229 --> 00:01:34.000
 need 

00:01:30.740 --> 00:01:34.000
 sleeps for it 

00:01:34.909 --> 00:01:37.380
 here you can still the exact 

00:01:36.020 --> 00:01:40.710
 ingredients 

00:01:37.380 --> 00:01:41.810
 fat proteins lactose water that yes 

00:01:40.710 --> 00:01:42.840
 everything 

00:01:41.810 --> 00:01:45.119
 the 

00:01:42.840 --> 00:01:46.380
 it is also important that is one of 

00:01:45.119 --> 00:01:48.600
 the food the most 

00:01:46.380 --> 00:01:52.229
 we will send the control 

00:01:48.600 --> 00:01:54.740
 no content no bacteria 

00:01:52.229 --> 00:01:54.740
 and pathogens 

00:02:00.670 --> 00:02:06.540
 That's what's usually on one hand 

00:02:02.619 --> 00:02:06.540
 does not deliver the money 

00:02:09.369 --> 00:02:13.019
 so now our fellow citizens 

00:02:37.010 --> 00:02:40.849
 hey here everything is hidden in 

00:02:38.720 --> 00:02:42.860
 pipes you see the not because they me 

00:02:40.849 --> 00:02:43.819
 You must always be able to cool 

00:02:42.860 --> 00:02:46.340
 you can not think of anything 

00:02:43.819 --> 00:02:49.189
 here is pasteurized that is the 

00:02:46.340 --> 00:02:51.280
 milk with 15 to 30 seconds to 72 to 

00:02:49.189 --> 00:02:54.319
 Heated to 75 degrees 

00:02:51.280 --> 00:02:56.480
 this is a centrifuge here is going to be fat 

00:02:54.319 --> 00:02:59.780
 remain separated from milk 

00:02:56.480 --> 00:03:01.310
 lean milk and cream the fed balls 

00:02:59.780 --> 00:03:02.599
 are pressed through a sieve so small 

00:03:01.310 --> 00:03:03.170
 that they are no longer in the milk 

00:03:02.599 --> 00:03:07.120
 drop 

00:03:03.170 --> 00:03:07.120
 which is the modernization of the 

00:03:53.880 --> 00:03:56.540
 and 8 

00:04:04.610 --> 00:04:15.680
 while I have but what fine 

00:04:11.210 --> 00:04:17.710
 brought along hey you why is so 

00:04:15.680 --> 00:04:17.710
 Not 

00:04:17.950 --> 00:04:21.459
 that becomes water
