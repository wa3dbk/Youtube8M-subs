we<00:00:04.920> are<00:00:05.069> on<00:00:05.220> and<00:00:05.490> I<00:00:05.580> wasn't<00:00:05.850> called<00:00:06.000> Appledore

00:00:06.380 --> 00:00:06.390 
we are on and I wasn't called Appledore

00:00:06.390 --> 00:00:08.810 
we are on and I wasn't called Appledore
Island<00:00:06.420> which<00:00:07.200> is<00:00:07.379> a<00:00:07.410> small<00:00:07.710> island<00:00:07.919> about<00:00:08.189> 95

00:00:08.810 --> 00:00:08.820 
Island which is a small island about 95

Island which is a small island about 95
acres<00:00:09.240> when<00:00:10.080> I<00:00:10.110> was<00:00:10.440> a<00:00:10.469> student<00:00:10.800> I<00:00:11.070> thought

00:00:11.450 --> 00:00:11.460 
acres when I was a student I thought

00:00:11.460 --> 00:00:13.459 
acres when I was a student I thought
this<00:00:11.670> was<00:00:11.880> just<00:00:12.090> the<00:00:12.210> greatest<00:00:12.509> place<00:00:12.960> I<00:00:13.200> mean

00:00:13.459 --> 00:00:13.469 
this was just the greatest place I mean

00:00:13.469 --> 00:00:14.839 
this was just the greatest place I mean
I<00:00:13.559> do<00:00:13.620> still<00:00:14.009> think<00:00:14.250> this<00:00:14.370> is<00:00:14.549> the<00:00:14.639> greatest

00:00:14.839 --> 00:00:14.849 
I do still think this is the greatest

00:00:14.849 --> 00:00:16.689 
I do still think this is the greatest
place<00:00:15.089> on<00:00:15.389> earth

00:00:16.689 --> 00:00:16.699 
place on earth

00:00:16.699 --> 00:00:20.390 
place on earth
so<00:00:17.699> I<00:00:17.730> actually<00:00:17.940> chose<00:00:18.810> UNH<00:00:19.439> as<00:00:19.650> my

00:00:20.390 --> 00:00:20.400 
so I actually chose UNH as my

00:00:20.400 --> 00:00:21.980 
so I actually chose UNH as my
undergraduate<00:00:21.119> school<00:00:21.330> because<00:00:21.750> of<00:00:21.779> the

00:00:21.980 --> 00:00:21.990 
undergraduate school because of the

00:00:21.990 --> 00:00:24.859 
undergraduate school because of the
Shoals<00:00:22.289> Marine<00:00:22.500> Lab<00:00:23.210> it's<00:00:24.210> a<00:00:24.269> very<00:00:24.420> special

00:00:24.859 --> 00:00:24.869 
Shoals Marine Lab it's a very special

00:00:24.869 --> 00:00:27.800 
Shoals Marine Lab it's a very special
place<00:00:25.080> because<00:00:25.410> this<00:00:25.800> place<00:00:26.099> is<00:00:26.810> primarily

00:00:27.800 --> 00:00:27.810 
place because this place is primarily

00:00:27.810 --> 00:00:32.179 
place because this place is primarily
geared<00:00:28.320> for<00:00:28.710> undergraduate<00:00:29.279> education<00:00:31.189> so

00:00:32.179 --> 00:00:32.189 
geared for undergraduate education so

00:00:32.189 --> 00:00:34.130 
geared for undergraduate education so
this<00:00:32.340> summer<00:00:32.610> after<00:00:32.850> my<00:00:33.090> freshman<00:00:33.239> year<00:00:33.930> that

00:00:34.130 --> 00:00:34.140 
this summer after my freshman year that

00:00:34.140 --> 00:00:35.780 
this summer after my freshman year that
came<00:00:34.649> out<00:00:34.829> here<00:00:35.040> and<00:00:35.190> took<00:00:35.340> underwater

00:00:35.780 --> 00:00:35.790 
came out here and took underwater

00:00:35.790 --> 00:00:39.400 
came out here and took underwater
research<00:00:37.129> so<00:00:38.129> now<00:00:38.280> I<00:00:38.309> come<00:00:38.550> back<00:00:38.579> every<00:00:39.030> summer

00:00:39.400 --> 00:00:39.410 
research so now I come back every summer

00:00:39.410 --> 00:00:41.720 
research so now I come back every summer
from<00:00:40.410> Alaska<00:00:40.890> to<00:00:41.040> teach<00:00:41.250> the<00:00:41.430> underwater

00:00:41.720 --> 00:00:41.730

research class the second day out on the

00:00:45.090 --> 00:00:47.299 
research class the second day out on the
float<00:00:45.360> we<00:00:45.570> give<00:00:45.809> them<00:00:46.020> a<00:00:46.289> slate<00:00:46.680> and<00:00:46.920> an

00:00:47.299 --> 00:00:47.309 
float we give them a slate and an

00:00:47.309 --> 00:00:48.650 
float we give them a slate and an
assignment<00:00:47.670> and<00:00:48.059> they're<00:00:48.210> going<00:00:48.420> and

00:00:48.650 --> 00:00:48.660 
assignment and they're going and

00:00:48.660 --> 00:00:54.170 
assignment and they're going and
collecting<00:00:49.020> data<00:00:52.340> every<00:00:53.340> year<00:00:53.370> we<00:00:53.820> have<00:00:54.059> the

00:00:54.170 --> 00:00:54.180 
collecting data every year we have the

00:00:54.180 --> 00:00:55.639 
collecting data every year we have the
students<00:00:54.510> come<00:00:54.660> up<00:00:54.780> with<00:00:54.930> their<00:00:55.050> own<00:00:55.079> proposal

00:00:55.639 --> 00:00:55.649 
students come up with their own proposal

00:00:55.649 --> 00:00:57.260 
students come up with their own proposal
we<00:00:55.739> don't<00:00:55.949> spoon-feed<00:00:56.520> than<00:00:56.699> anything<00:00:56.969> we

00:00:57.260 --> 00:00:57.270 
we don't spoon-feed than anything we

00:00:57.270 --> 00:00:58.580 
we don't spoon-feed than anything we
want<00:00:57.449> them<00:00:57.629> to<00:00:57.750> go<00:00:57.870> out<00:00:57.960> and<00:00:58.020> look<00:00:58.230> at<00:00:58.379> things

00:00:58.580 --> 00:00:58.590 
want them to go out and look at things

00:00:58.590 --> 00:01:01.340 
want them to go out and look at things
and<00:00:58.969> make<00:00:59.969> their<00:01:00.180> own<00:01:00.270> observations<00:01:00.629> and<00:01:01.199> then

00:01:01.340 --> 00:01:01.350 
and make their own observations and then

00:01:01.350 --> 00:01:03.650 
and make their own observations and then
we'll<00:01:01.710> guide<00:01:02.160> them<00:01:02.430> in<00:01:02.640> trying<00:01:02.940> to<00:01:03.149> develop<00:01:03.449> a

00:01:03.650 --> 00:01:03.660 
we'll guide them in trying to develop a

00:01:03.660 --> 00:01:05.390 
we'll guide them in trying to develop a
question<00:01:04.049> that<00:01:04.589> can<00:01:04.799> be<00:01:04.830> answered<00:01:04.949> in<00:01:05.369> a

00:01:05.390 --> 00:01:05.400 
question that can be answered in a

00:01:05.400 --> 00:01:09.289 
question that can be answered in a
variety<00:01:05.549> of<00:01:05.729> ways<00:01:07.130> it's<00:01:08.130> very<00:01:08.400> real<00:01:08.670> you<00:01:09.000> know

00:01:09.289 --> 00:01:09.299 
variety of ways it's very real you know

00:01:09.299 --> 00:01:13.609 
variety of ways it's very real you know
we<00:01:10.200> learn<00:01:10.350> basic<00:01:11.090> diving<00:01:12.090> safety<00:01:12.510> and<00:01:12.750> ecology

00:01:13.609 --> 00:01:13.619 
we learn basic diving safety and ecology

00:01:13.619 --> 00:01:17.149 
we learn basic diving safety and ecology
and<00:01:13.860> then<00:01:14.100> we<00:01:14.760> can<00:01:15.409> just<00:01:16.409> you<00:01:16.619> know<00:01:16.650> jump<00:01:17.070> right

00:01:17.149 --> 00:01:17.159 
and then we can just you know jump right

00:01:17.159 --> 00:01:23.420 
and then we can just you know jump right
in<00:01:17.369> and<00:01:18.979> ask<00:01:19.979> questions<00:01:20.100> ourselves<00:01:20.490> a<00:01:22.369> lot<00:01:23.369> of

00:02:00.710 --> 00:02:00.720 
this is a really amazing experience it's

00:02:00.720 --> 00:02:02.630 
this is a really amazing experience it's
really<00:02:00.780> special<00:02:01.530> I<00:02:01.770> think<00:02:02.070> it's<00:02:02.340> extremely

00:02:02.630 --> 00:02:02.640 
really special I think it's extremely

00:02:02.640 --> 00:02:04.760 
really special I think it's extremely
valuable<00:02:02.910> that<00:02:03.600> we<00:02:03.720> get<00:02:03.900> such<00:02:04.110> a<00:02:04.140> variance<00:02:04.560> in

00:02:04.760 --> 00:02:04.770 
valuable that we get such a variance in

00:02:04.770 --> 00:02:08.780 
valuable that we get such a variance in
