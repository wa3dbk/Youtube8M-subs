00:01:35.730 --> 00:01:35.740 
dozen people at a time and we have built

00:01:35.740 --> 00:01:40.679 
dozen people at a time and we have built
since<00:01:36.100> then<00:01:36.399> in<00:01:37.329> addition<00:01:38.289> to<00:01:38.890> our<00:01:38.920> space<00:01:39.689> that

00:01:44.789 --> 00:01:51.840 
can accommodate up to 40 participants
and<00:01:45.960> we<00:01:46.960> decided<00:01:47.469> to<00:01:47.679> use<00:01:49.020> 10<00:01:50.020> projectors<00:01:50.850> five

00:01:51.840 --> 00:01:51.850 
and we decided to use 10 projectors five

00:01:51.850 --> 00:01:54.050 
and we decided to use 10 projectors five
across<00:01:52.210> the<00:01:52.509> top<00:01:52.749> five<00:01:53.049> across<00:01:53.380> the<00:01:53.710> bottom

00:01:54.050 --> 00:01:54.060 
across the top five across the bottom

00:01:54.060 --> 00:01:59.580 
across the top five across the bottom
which<00:01:55.060> gave<00:01:55.479> us<00:01:55.509> a<00:01:55.960> length<00:01:56.499> of<00:01:56.770> 32<00:01:57.639> feet<00:01:58.149> by<00:01:59.079> 10

00:01:59.580 --> 00:01:59.590 
which gave us a length of 32 feet by 10

00:01:59.590 --> 00:02:03.929 
which gave us a length of 32 feet by 10
feet<00:01:59.619> high<00:02:00.280> it<00:02:00.909> was<00:02:01.899> extremely<00:02:02.530> effective<00:02:02.939> now

00:02:03.929 --> 00:02:03.939 
feet high it was extremely effective now

00:02:03.939 --> 00:02:08.070 
feet high it was extremely effective now
at<00:02:04.240> the<00:02:04.780> time<00:02:05.079> we<00:02:05.560> used<00:02:06.240> another<00:02:07.240> set<00:02:07.600> of<00:02:07.810> ten

00:02:08.070 --> 00:02:08.080 
at the time we used another set of ten

00:02:08.080 --> 00:02:10.140 
at the time we used another set of ten
projectors<00:02:08.680> that<00:02:08.710> are<00:02:08.890> the<00:02:09.250> highest<00:02:09.430> end<00:02:09.910> of

00:02:10.140 --> 00:02:10.150

that

00:02:10.760 --> 00:02:10.770 
that

00:02:10.770 --> 00:02:14.390 
that
product<00:02:11.640> when<00:02:12.570> we<00:02:12.870> installed<00:02:13.680> them<00:02:13.920> they<00:02:14.280> were

00:02:14.390 --> 00:02:14.400 
product when we installed them they were

00:02:14.400 --> 00:02:17.990 
product when we installed them they were
fine<00:02:14.700> but<00:02:15.630> they<00:02:16.200> started<00:02:16.710> to<00:02:16.770> fade<00:02:17.220> each<00:02:17.790> of

00:02:17.990 --> 00:02:18.000 
fine but they started to fade each of

00:02:18.000 --> 00:02:20.270 
fine but they started to fade each of
them<00:02:18.180> faded<00:02:18.690> at<00:02:18.900> a<00:02:18.960> different<00:02:19.620> rate<00:02:19.830> than<00:02:20.100> the

00:02:20.270 --> 00:02:20.280 
them faded at a different rate than the

00:02:20.280 --> 00:02:22.670 
them faded at a different rate than the
other<00:02:20.310> so<00:02:20.820> you<00:02:20.850> see<00:02:21.270> the<00:02:21.960> difference<00:02:22.470> in

00:02:22.670 --> 00:02:22.680 
other so you see the difference in

00:02:22.680 --> 00:02:25.910 
other so you see the difference in
brightness<00:02:23.670> and<00:02:24.210> color<00:02:24.510> you<00:02:25.080> see<00:02:25.290> the<00:02:25.470> patch

00:02:25.910 --> 00:02:25.920 
brightness and color you see the patch

00:02:25.920 --> 00:02:29.540 
brightness and color you see the patch
is<00:02:26.190> 10<00:02:26.520> different<00:02:27.000> patches<00:02:28.100> you<00:02:29.100> see<00:02:29.340> the

00:02:29.540 --> 00:02:29.550 
is 10 different patches you see the

00:02:29.550 --> 00:02:31.210 
is 10 different patches you see the
lines<00:02:29.790> and<00:02:30.120> between<00:02:30.240> them

00:02:31.210 --> 00:02:31.220

however<00:02:32.220> they<00:02:32.850> were<00:02:32.910> costly<00:02:33.630> to<00:02:33.870> maintain<00:02:34.340> we

00:02:35.330 --> 00:02:35.340 
however they were costly to maintain we

00:02:35.340 --> 00:02:39.560 
however they were costly to maintain we
used<00:02:35.550> to<00:02:35.790> spend<00:02:36.530> approximately<00:02:38.060> $600<00:02:39.060> on<00:02:39.240> each

00:02:39.560 --> 00:02:39.570 
used to spend approximately $600 on each

00:02:39.570 --> 00:02:42.230 
used to spend approximately $600 on each
lamp<00:02:39.930> when<00:02:40.380> when<00:02:40.740> it<00:02:40.860> fades<00:02:41.130> because<00:02:41.610> we<00:02:42.030> don't

00:02:42.230 --> 00:02:42.240 
lamp when when it fades because we don't

00:02:42.240 --> 00:02:44.720 
lamp when when it fades because we don't
want<00:02:42.360> it<00:02:42.540> to<00:02:43.170> fade<00:02:43.350> so<00:02:43.590> we<00:02:43.950> used<00:02:44.100> to<00:02:44.220> buy<00:02:44.370> three

00:02:44.720 --> 00:02:44.730 
want it to fade so we used to buy three

00:02:44.730 --> 00:02:48.770 
want it to fade so we used to buy three
or<00:02:44.760> four<00:02:45.320> lamps<00:02:46.320> at<00:02:46.770> the<00:02:47.190> cost<00:02:47.430> of<00:02:47.640> $600<00:02:48.540> a<00:02:48.720> year

00:02:48.770 --> 00:02:48.780 
or four lamps at the cost of $600 a year

00:02:48.780 --> 00:02:51.530 
or four lamps at the cost of $600 a year
for<00:02:49.590> each<00:02:49.830> of<00:02:50.070> them<00:02:50.250> we<00:02:50.970> need<00:02:51.090> to<00:02:51.120> climb

00:02:51.530 --> 00:02:51.540 
for each of them we need to climb

00:02:51.540 --> 00:02:55.010 
for each of them we need to climb
ladders<00:02:51.870> which<00:02:52.350> was<00:02:52.530> dangerous<00:02:52.770> for<00:02:53.420> our<00:02:54.420> guys

00:02:55.010 --> 00:02:55.020 
ladders which was dangerous for our guys

00:02:55.020 --> 00:02:57.380 
ladders which was dangerous for our guys
each<00:02:55.380> time<00:02:55.650> we<00:02:55.860> touched<00:02:56.190> them<00:02:56.460> and<00:02:56.670> changed

00:02:57.380 --> 00:02:57.390 
each time we touched them and changed

00:02:57.390 --> 00:02:57.980 
each time we touched them and changed
the<00:02:57.540> lamp

00:02:57.980 --> 00:02:57.990 
the lamp

00:02:57.990 --> 00:03:00.740 
the lamp
it<00:02:58.530> shakes<00:02:58.890> them<00:02:59.160> we<00:02:59.340> have<00:02:59.580> to<00:02:59.850> align<00:03:00.450> them

00:03:00.740 --> 00:03:00.750 
it shakes them we have to align them

00:03:00.750 --> 00:03:04.520 
it shakes them we have to align them
again<00:03:01.880> and<00:03:02.880> I<00:03:03.360> started<00:03:03.810> to<00:03:03.930> look<00:03:04.080> at<00:03:04.290> the

00:03:04.520 --> 00:03:04.530 
again and I started to look at the

00:03:04.530 --> 00:03:08.390 
again and I started to look at the
newest<00:03:06.650> technology<00:03:07.650> the<00:03:07.830> state-of-the-art

00:03:08.390 --> 00:03:08.400 
newest technology the state-of-the-art

00:03:08.400 --> 00:03:15.640 
newest technology the state-of-the-art
edge<00:03:08.820> blending<00:03:10.640> technology<00:03:11.640> and<00:03:13.400> laser

00:03:15.640 --> 00:03:15.650 
edge blending technology and laser

00:03:15.650 --> 00:03:19.220 
edge blending technology and laser
projection<00:03:16.650> and<00:03:17.100> I<00:03:17.940> focused<00:03:18.420> on<00:03:18.630> one<00:03:18.900> product

00:03:19.220 --> 00:03:19.230 
projection and I focused on one product

00:03:19.230 --> 00:03:23.300 
projection and I focused on one product
which<00:03:19.620> was<00:03:19.800> the<00:03:20.010> Sony<00:03:20.990> projectors<00:03:21.990> it<00:03:22.950> had

00:03:23.300 --> 00:03:23.310 
which was the Sony projectors it had

00:03:23.310 --> 00:03:28.060 
which was the Sony projectors it had
twice<00:03:24.210> the<00:03:24.690> brightness<00:03:25.460> like<00:03:26.460> 4000<00:03:27.360> lumens

00:03:28.060 --> 00:03:28.070 
twice the brightness like 4000 lumens

00:03:28.070 --> 00:03:32.270 
twice the brightness like 4000 lumens
than<00:03:29.070> the<00:03:29.430> old<00:03:29.640> ones<00:03:29.910> that<00:03:30.150> we<00:03:30.360> had<00:03:30.680> that<00:03:31.680> was<00:03:32.010> a

00:03:32.270 --> 00:03:32.280 
than the old ones that we had that was a

00:03:32.280 --> 00:03:35.870 
than the old ones that we had that was a
benefit<00:03:33.000> we<00:03:33.780> had<00:03:33.960> 10<00:03:34.800> of<00:03:34.950> those<00:03:35.220> so<00:03:35.610> you<00:03:35.640> have

00:03:35.870 --> 00:03:35.880 
benefit we had 10 of those so you have

00:03:35.880 --> 00:03:39.380 
benefit we had 10 of those so you have
10<00:03:36.330> times<00:03:37.070> 4000<00:03:38.070> on<00:03:38.460> a<00:03:38.520> wall<00:03:38.820> you<00:03:39.000> get<00:03:39.240> the

00:03:39.380 --> 00:03:39.390 
10 times 4000 on a wall you get the

00:03:39.390 --> 00:03:43.190 
10 times 4000 on a wall you get the
bright<00:03:39.980> image<00:03:40.980> it<00:03:41.670> had<00:03:41.970> also<00:03:42.240> something<00:03:42.840> which

00:03:43.190 --> 00:03:43.200 
bright image it had also something which

00:03:43.200 --> 00:03:48.070 
bright image it had also something which
I<00:03:43.760> loved<00:03:44.760> which<00:03:45.270> was<00:03:45.300> the<00:03:46.260> new<00:03:46.470> laser<00:03:47.070> diode

00:03:48.070 --> 00:03:48.080 
I loved which was the new laser diode

00:03:48.080 --> 00:03:51.650 
I loved which was the new laser diode
projection<00:03:49.400> technology<00:03:50.400> in<00:03:50.640> lieu<00:03:50.940> of<00:03:50.970> lamps

00:03:51.650 --> 00:03:51.660 
projection technology in lieu of lamps

00:03:51.660 --> 00:03:55.190 
projection technology in lieu of lamps
those<00:03:52.380> can<00:03:52.980> last<00:03:53.310> for<00:03:53.640> 20,000<00:03:54.420> hours<00:03:54.540> which<00:03:55.050> in

00:03:55.190 --> 00:03:55.200 
those can last for 20,000 hours which in

00:03:55.200 --> 00:03:58.130 
those can last for 20,000 hours which in
our<00:03:55.290> case<00:03:55.440> could<00:03:56.040> be<00:03:56.220> up<00:03:56.610> to<00:03:56.850> 15<00:03:57.270> years<00:03:57.540> 10<00:03:57.960> to

00:03:58.130 --> 00:03:58.140 
our case could be up to 15 years 10 to

00:03:58.140 --> 00:04:02.150 
our case could be up to 15 years 10 to
15<00:03:58.710> years<00:03:58.820> without<00:03:59.820> touching<00:04:00.600> them<00:04:01.010> which<00:04:02.010> is

00:04:02.150 --> 00:04:02.160 
15 years without touching them which is

00:04:02.160 --> 00:04:04.600 
15 years without touching them which is
a<00:04:02.190> great<00:04:02.690> benefit

00:04:04.600 --> 00:04:04.610 
a great benefit

00:04:04.610 --> 00:04:07.600 
a great benefit
the<00:04:04.880> other<00:04:05.090> benefit<00:04:05.870> was<00:04:06.590> the<00:04:07.160> fact<00:04:07.460> that

00:04:07.600 --> 00:04:07.610 
the other benefit was the fact that

00:04:07.610 --> 00:04:10.720 
the other benefit was the fact that
those<00:04:08.360> are<00:04:08.420> edge<00:04:08.930> blending<00:04:09.520> projectors<00:04:10.520> that

00:04:10.720 --> 00:04:10.730 
those are edge blending projectors that

00:04:10.730 --> 00:04:15.220 
those are edge blending projectors that
is<00:04:11.440> there<00:04:12.440> is<00:04:12.530> a<00:04:12.560> way<00:04:12.800> to<00:04:12.830> blend<00:04:14.230> the

00:04:15.220 --> 00:04:15.230 
is there is a way to blend the

00:04:15.230 --> 00:04:17.740 
is there is a way to blend the
projectors<00:04:15.830> the<00:04:15.860> ten<00:04:16.250> of<00:04:16.400> them<00:04:16.640> such<00:04:17.269> as<00:04:17.299> the
