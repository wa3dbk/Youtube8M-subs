so<00:00:17.640> I<00:00:18.000> didn't<00:00:18.600> bother<00:00:18.720> with<00:00:18.930> the<00:00:19.500> video<00:00:19.710> for

00:00:20.029 --> 00:00:20.039 
so I didn't bother with the video for

00:00:20.039 --> 00:00:21.890 
so I didn't bother with the video for
the<00:00:20.130> war<00:00:20.369> because<00:00:21.060> it<00:00:21.090> was<00:00:21.240> honestly<00:00:21.630> pretty

00:00:21.890 --> 00:00:21.900 
the war because it was honestly pretty

00:00:21.900 --> 00:00:23.779 
the war because it was honestly pretty
uneventful<00:00:22.140> and<00:00:22.710> didn't<00:00:23.189> really<00:00:23.369> require<00:00:23.670> a

00:00:23.779 --> 00:00:23.789 
uneventful and didn't really require a

00:00:23.789 --> 00:00:26.810 
uneventful and didn't really require a
video<00:00:24.269> but<00:00:25.050> because<00:00:25.890> it<00:00:26.010> was<00:00:26.099> uneventful<00:00:26.430> the

00:00:26.810 --> 00:00:26.820 
video but because it was uneventful the

00:00:26.820 --> 00:00:28.580 
video but because it was uneventful the
games<00:00:27.060> should<00:00:27.390> be<00:00:27.420> coming<00:00:27.810> to<00:00:27.930> a<00:00:27.960> close<00:00:28.019> here

00:00:28.580 --> 00:00:28.590 
games should be coming to a close here

00:00:28.590 --> 00:00:31.040 
games should be coming to a close here
in<00:00:28.619> just<00:00:28.980> a<00:00:29.099> few<00:00:29.130> days<00:00:29.460> the<00:00:29.939> who<00:00:30.810> are<00:00:30.900> they

00:00:31.040 --> 00:00:31.050 
in just a few days the who are they

00:00:31.050 --> 00:00:35.560 
in just a few days the who are they
LeBron<00:00:31.529> James<00:00:32.120> should<00:00:33.120> be<00:00:33.590> victorious<00:00:34.590> so

00:00:35.560 --> 00:00:35.570 
LeBron James should be victorious so

00:00:35.570 --> 00:00:38.990 
LeBron James should be victorious so

00:00:45.600 --> 00:00:47.900 
man and save crap and we were discussing
the<00:00:46.230> events<00:00:46.590> of<00:00:46.739> sieve<00:00:46.980> craft<00:00:47.250> and<00:00:47.520> what<00:00:47.700> is<00:00:47.789> to

00:00:47.900 --> 00:00:47.910 
the events of sieve craft and what is to

00:00:47.910 --> 00:00:49.790 
the events of sieve craft and what is to
come<00:00:48.090> so<00:00:48.450> we've<00:00:48.629> been<00:00:48.750> talking<00:00:49.020> about<00:00:49.289> how

come so we've been talking about how

00:00:49.800 --> 00:00:53.779 
come so we've been talking about how
when<00:00:50.129> the<00:00:50.219> map<00:00:50.430> is<00:00:50.670> rolled<00:00:51.020> to<00:00:52.190> the<00:00:53.190> next<00:00:53.430> phase

00:00:53.779 --> 00:00:53.789 
when the map is rolled to the next phase

00:00:53.789 --> 00:00:57.200 
when the map is rolled to the next phase
that<00:00:53.820> we're<00:00:54.629> going<00:00:55.020> to<00:00:55.640> you<00:00:56.640> know<00:00:56.730> start<00:00:57.059> up<00:00:57.120> a

00:00:57.210 --> 00:00:58.939 
that we're going to you know start up a
new<00:00:57.239> save<00:00:57.629> and<00:00:57.930> that<00:00:57.960> we<00:00:58.170> want<00:00:58.350> as<00:00:58.440> many<00:00:58.559> peeps

00:00:58.939 --> 00:00:58.949 
new save and that we want as many peeps

00:00:58.949 --> 00:01:03.229 
new save and that we want as many peeps
as<00:00:59.160> possible<00:00:59.730> to<00:01:00.210> come<00:01:00.390> join<00:01:00.690> us<00:01:01.370> so<00:01:02.370> that<00:01:02.609> we

up<00:01:10.350> so<00:01:11.040> relatively<00:01:11.670> new<00:01:11.909> sieve<00:01:12.240> craft<00:01:12.540> is<00:01:12.810> this

00:01:13.370 --> 00:01:13.380 
up so relatively new sieve craft is this

00:01:13.380 --> 00:01:15.590 
up so relatively new sieve craft is this
whole<00:01:13.619> new<00:01:13.860> thing<00:01:14.280> where<00:01:14.610> they<00:01:15.240> have<00:01:15.420> the

00:01:15.590 --> 00:01:15.600 
whole new thing where they have the

00:01:15.600 --> 00:01:17.390 
whole new thing where they have the
original<00:01:15.689> two<00:01:16.140> servers<00:01:16.439> like<00:01:16.740> always<00:01:16.979> and

00:01:17.390 --> 00:01:17.400 
original two servers like always and

00:01:17.400 --> 00:01:18.710 
original two servers like always and
they're<00:01:17.580> the<00:01:17.700> same<00:01:17.880> as<00:01:18.030> they've<00:01:18.180> always<00:01:18.299> been

00:01:18.710 --> 00:01:18.720 
they're the same as they've always been

00:01:18.720 --> 00:01:20.450 
they're the same as they've always been

00:01:20.450 --> 00:01:20.460 
but now what they also have in addition

00:01:20.460 --> 00:01:24.620 
but now what they also have in addition
to<00:01:20.580> that<00:01:20.729> is<00:01:21.710> a<00:01:22.710> whole<00:01:22.950> new<00:01:23.159> server<00:01:23.820> that's

00:01:24.620 --> 00:01:24.630 
to that is a whole new server that's

00:01:24.630 --> 00:01:27.320 
to that is a whole new server that's
called<00:01:24.960> casual<00:01:25.619> mode<00:01:25.799> and<00:01:26.130> what<00:01:26.640> casual<00:01:27.150> mode

00:01:27.320 --> 00:01:27.330 
called casual mode and what casual mode

00:01:27.330 --> 00:01:30.010 
called casual mode and what casual mode
is<00:01:27.570> is<00:01:27.960> there's<00:01:28.350> no<00:01:28.500> war<00:01:28.770> there's<00:01:29.130> no<00:01:29.189> PvP

00:01:30.010 --> 00:01:30.020 
is is there's no war there's no PvP

00:01:30.020 --> 00:01:32.060 
is is there's no war there's no PvP
which<00:01:31.020> means<00:01:31.320> that<00:01:31.590> you<00:01:31.829> could<00:01:31.950> just

00:01:32.060 --> 00:01:32.070 
which means that you could just

00:01:32.070 --> 00:01:34.609 
which means that you could just
peacefully<00:01:32.670> make<00:01:32.880> a<00:01:32.909> save<00:01:33.270> just<00:01:34.170> for<00:01:34.259> the<00:01:34.439> love

00:01:34.609 --> 00:01:34.619 
peacefully make a save just for the love

00:01:34.619 --> 00:01:36.200 
peacefully make a save just for the love
of<00:01:34.650> making<00:01:34.920> really<00:01:35.280> cool<00:01:35.400> buildings<00:01:36.000> and

00:01:36.200 --> 00:01:36.210 
of making really cool buildings and

00:01:36.210 --> 00:01:38.210 
of making really cool buildings and
growing<00:01:36.509> and<00:01:36.930> not<00:01:37.110> have<00:01:37.350> to<00:01:37.500> worry<00:01:37.680> about<00:01:37.829> war

00:01:38.210 --> 00:01:38.220 
growing and not have to worry about war

00:01:38.220 --> 00:01:40.670 
growing and not have to worry about war
which<00:01:39.030> means<00:01:39.240> not<00:01:39.479> having<00:01:39.840> to<00:01:39.990> get<00:01:40.350> carried

00:01:40.670 --> 00:01:40.680 
which means not having to get carried

00:01:40.680 --> 00:01:42.380 
which means not having to get carried
away<00:01:40.770> with<00:01:41.340> a<00:01:41.820> bunch<00:01:42.180> of<00:01:42.270> defensive

away with a bunch of defensive

00:01:42.390 --> 00:01:44.090 
away with a bunch of defensive
structures<00:01:43.200> and<00:01:43.380> stuff<00:01:43.530> like<00:01:43.649> that<00:01:43.829> you<00:01:43.950> could

00:01:44.090 --> 00:01:44.100 
structures and stuff like that you could

00:01:44.100 --> 00:01:46.609 
structures and stuff like that you could
just<00:01:44.220> focus<00:01:44.399> on<00:01:44.729> building<00:01:45.210> your<00:01:45.570> Civ<00:01:46.350> how<00:01:46.560> you

00:01:46.609 --> 00:01:46.619 
just focus on building your Civ how you

the game and not have to worry about the

nastiness that can potentially come with

00:01:52.740 --> 00:01:55.940 
nastiness that can potentially come with
it<00:01:52.890> so<00:01:53.659> we<00:01:54.659> thought<00:01:54.840> that<00:01:54.899> that's<00:01:55.110> potentially

00:01:55.940 --> 00:01:55.950 
it so we thought that that's potentially

00:01:55.950 --> 00:01:59.120 
it so we thought that that's potentially
interesting<00:01:56.340> it<00:01:56.490> takes<00:01:56.729> away<00:01:57.049> war<00:01:58.049> which<00:01:58.860> in<00:01:59.070> a

00:01:59.120 --> 00:01:59.130 
interesting it takes away war which in a

00:01:59.130 --> 00:02:00.740 
interesting it takes away war which in a
lot<00:01:59.280> of<00:01:59.399> respects<00:01:59.759> can<00:02:00.000> be<00:02:00.119> a<00:02:00.149> very<00:02:00.390> fun

00:02:00.740 --> 00:02:00.750 
lot of respects can be a very fun

00:02:00.750 --> 00:02:02.840 
lot of respects can be a very fun
element<00:02:01.200> of<00:02:01.259> the<00:02:01.320> game<00:02:01.500> but<00:02:02.130> at<00:02:02.250> times<00:02:02.549> can

00:02:02.840 --> 00:02:02.850 
element of the game but at times can

00:02:02.850 --> 00:02:04.580 
element of the game but at times can
also<00:02:03.000> be<00:02:03.210> a<00:02:03.240> very<00:02:03.390> frustrating<00:02:03.750> element<00:02:04.530> of

00:02:04.580 --> 00:02:04.590 
also be a very frustrating element of

00:02:04.590 --> 00:02:07.789 
also be a very frustrating element of
the<00:02:04.649> game<00:02:04.829> so<00:02:05.670> I<00:02:06.270> leave<00:02:06.840> it<00:02:06.990> to<00:02:07.110> you<00:02:07.200> the<00:02:07.380> P<00:02:07.530> so

00:02:07.789 --> 00:02:07.799 
the game so I leave it to you the P so

00:02:07.799 --> 00:02:09.260 
the game so I leave it to you the P so
me<00:02:08.009> and<00:02:08.099> scale<00:02:08.340> were<00:02:08.459> discussing<00:02:08.970> like<00:02:09.119> hey

00:02:09.260 --> 00:02:09.270 
me and scale were discussing like hey

00:02:09.270 --> 00:02:10.850 
me and scale were discussing like hey
maybe<00:02:09.479> we<00:02:09.720> should<00:02:09.869> just<00:02:09.959> go<00:02:10.140> into<00:02:10.289> casual<00:02:10.709> mode

00:02:10.850 --> 00:02:10.860 
maybe we should just go into casual mode

00:02:10.860 --> 00:02:11.930 
maybe we should just go into casual mode
and<00:02:11.039> try<00:02:11.160> that<00:02:11.310> for<00:02:11.489> a<00:02:11.580> change

00:02:11.930 --> 00:02:11.940 
and try that for a change

00:02:11.940 --> 00:02:12.650 
and try that for a change
instead

00:02:12.650 --> 00:02:12.660

00:02:14.220 --> 00:02:16.760 
starting up with this map when it rolls
over<00:02:14.400> but<00:02:14.880> now<00:02:15.810> we're<00:02:15.960> not<00:02:16.050> so<00:02:16.260> sure<00:02:16.500> we've

00:02:16.760 --> 00:02:16.770 
over but now we're not so sure we've

been debating it back and forth and at
the<00:02:19.290> end<00:02:19.440> we<00:02:19.620> decided<00:02:20.070> it<00:02:20.250> should<00:02:20.280> be<00:02:20.460> up<00:02:20.640> to

00:02:20.780 --> 00:02:20.790 
the end we decided it should be up to

00:02:20.790 --> 00:02:22.690 
the end we decided it should be up to
you<00:02:20.970> the<00:02:21.210> P<00:02:21.420> so<00:02:21.780> what<00:02:22.020> I<00:02:22.050> want<00:02:22.350> from<00:02:22.560> you

is to comment below and let me know what

00:02:29.160 --> 00:02:32.300 
is to comment below and let me know what
your<00:02:29.430> take<00:02:29.730> is<00:02:29.760> should<00:02:30.390> we<00:02:30.660> either<00:02:31.110> wait<00:02:32.070> for

00:02:32.300 --> 00:02:32.310 
your take is should we either wait for

00:02:32.310 --> 00:02:35.300 
your take is should we either wait for
this<00:02:32.400> map<00:02:32.670> to<00:02:33.030> roll<00:02:33.780> and<00:02:34.140> start<00:02:34.920> over<00:02:35.160> which

00:02:35.300 --> 00:02:35.310 
this map to roll and start over which

00:02:35.310 --> 00:02:37.090 
this map to roll and start over which
like<00:02:35.490> I<00:02:35.580> said<00:02:35.790> should<00:02:36.030> be<00:02:36.060> in<00:02:36.210> just<00:02:36.420> a<00:02:36.480> few<00:02:36.630> days

00:02:37.090 --> 00:02:37.100 
like I said should be in just a few days

00:02:37.100 --> 00:02:41.720 
like I said should be in just a few days
or<00:02:38.240> should<00:02:39.240> we<00:02:39.390> go<00:02:39.540> ahead<00:02:39.720> and<00:02:40.260> start<00:02:40.730> working

00:02:41.720 --> 00:02:41.730 
or should we go ahead and start working

00:02:41.730 --> 00:02:44.210 
or should we go ahead and start working
towards<00:02:42.120> a<00:02:42.300> sieve<00:02:42.570> on<00:02:42.840> the<00:02:42.960> casual<00:02:43.530> server<00:02:43.860> and

00:02:44.210 --> 00:02:44.220 
towards a sieve on the casual server and

00:02:44.220 --> 00:02:48.080 
towards a sieve on the casual server and
have<00:02:45.180> you<00:02:45.420> the<00:02:45.570> peach<00:02:45.780> join<00:02:46.110> us<00:02:46.290> on<00:02:46.470> there<00:02:47.100> so

00:02:48.080 --> 00:02:48.090 
have you the peach join us on there so

00:02:48.090 --> 00:02:51.590 
have you the peach join us on there so

00:03:02.000 --> 00:03:02.010 
what the judgment was and where you can

00:03:02.010 --> 00:03:03.530 
what the judgment was and where you can
find<00:03:02.040> us<00:03:02.460> on<00:03:02.640> what<00:03:02.820> server<00:03:03.030> we're<00:03:03.270> gonna<00:03:03.390> be

00:03:03.530 --> 00:03:03.540 
find us on what server we're gonna be

00:03:03.540 --> 00:03:06.940 
find us on what server we're gonna be
located<00:03:04.110> and<00:03:04.290> what<00:03:04.860> the<00:03:05.010> plan<00:03:05.250> is<00:03:05.730> going<00:03:06.540> to<00:03:06.630> be

located and what the plan is going to be

00:03:06.950 --> 00:03:09.680 
located and what the plan is going to be
honestly<00:03:07.950> I'm<00:03:08.220> ok<00:03:08.520> with<00:03:08.550> it<00:03:08.790> either<00:03:08.910> way<00:03:09.180> both

00:03:09.680 --> 00:03:09.690 
honestly I'm ok with it either way both

honestly I'm ok with it either way both
versions<00:03:10.320> offer<00:03:10.590> something<00:03:11.100> really<00:03:11.340> fun<00:03:11.610> you

00:03:11.840 --> 00:03:11.850 
versions offer something really fun you

00:03:11.850 --> 00:03:13.760

know<00:03:11.910> war<00:03:12.210> can<00:03:12.570> be<00:03:12.600> fun<00:03:13.020> but<00:03:13.260> like<00:03:13.380> I<00:03:13.500> said<00:03:13.680> it

00:03:13.760 --> 00:03:13.770 
know war can be fun but like I said it

00:03:13.770 --> 00:03:15.050 
know war can be fun but like I said it
could<00:03:13.830> also<00:03:13.980> be<00:03:14.100> pretty<00:03:14.460> frustrating<00:03:14.970> at

00:03:15.050 --> 00:03:15.060 
could also be pretty frustrating at

00:03:15.060 --> 00:03:17.210 
could also be pretty frustrating at
times<00:03:15.090> and<00:03:15.630> maybe<00:03:16.260> it<00:03:16.470> would<00:03:16.620> be<00:03:16.650> fun<00:03:16.770> to<00:03:17.190> just

00:03:17.210 --> 00:03:17.220 
times and maybe it would be fun to just

00:03:17.220 --> 00:03:19.250 
times and maybe it would be fun to just
focus<00:03:17.760> on<00:03:17.910> growing<00:03:18.270> a<00:03:18.330> really<00:03:18.570> cool<00:03:18.750> Civ<00:03:19.020> and

00:03:19.250 --> 00:03:19.260 
focus on growing a really cool Civ and

00:03:19.260 --> 00:03:21.350 
focus on growing a really cool Civ and
not<00:03:19.740> having<00:03:20.070> to<00:03:20.130> worry<00:03:20.310> about<00:03:20.400> it<00:03:20.730> I<00:03:20.820> guess<00:03:21.030> I'm

where<00:03:39.600> you're<00:03:39.720> gonna<00:03:39.810> be<00:03:39.990> able<00:03:40.080> to<00:03:40.170> find<00:03:40.440> us

00:03:40.610 --> 00:03:40.620 
where you're gonna be able to find us

00:03:40.620 --> 00:03:42.320 
where you're gonna be able to find us
and<00:03:40.800> what<00:03:40.980> we're<00:03:41.190> gonna<00:03:41.340> be<00:03:41.520> able<00:03:41.640> to<00:03:41.820> do<00:03:41.970> and

and what we're gonna be able to do and

00:03:42.330 --> 00:03:45.410 
and what we're gonna be able to do and
then<00:03:42.780> the<00:03:43.530> proper<00:03:44.280> sieve<00:03:44.520> craft<00:03:44.820> series<00:03:45.209> can

00:03:45.410 --> 00:03:45.420 
then the proper sieve craft series can

00:03:45.420 --> 00:03:47.660 
then the proper sieve craft series can
kick<00:03:45.600> off<00:03:45.780> from<00:03:45.930> there<00:03:46.170> where<00:03:46.860> rate<00:03:47.310> from<00:03:47.520> day

00:03:47.660 --> 00:03:47.670 
kick off from there where rate from day

00:03:47.670 --> 00:03:48.979 
kick off from there where rate from day
one<00:03:47.940> I'll<00:03:48.090> be<00:03:48.209> bringing<00:03:48.390> you<00:03:48.660> all<00:03:48.690> the<00:03:48.840> action

one I'll be bringing you all the action
of<00:03:49.560> building<00:03:50.430> a<00:03:50.489> sieve<00:03:51.170> regardless<00:03:52.170> of

00:03:52.340 --> 00:03:52.350 
of building a sieve regardless of

00:03:52.350 --> 00:03:54.530 
of building a sieve regardless of
whether<00:03:52.500> it's<00:03:52.709> on<00:03:52.830> a<00:03:52.860> PvP<00:03:53.430> or<00:03:53.700> a<00:03:53.760> casual<00:03:54.239> server
