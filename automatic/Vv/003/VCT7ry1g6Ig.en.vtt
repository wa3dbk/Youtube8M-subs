the<00:00:24.600> needle<00:00:25.699> but<00:00:26.699> it<00:00:26.820> didn't<00:00:27.090> quite<00:00:27.480> say<00:00:28.080> was

00:00:28.700 --> 00:00:28.710 
the needle but it didn't quite say was

00:00:28.710 --> 00:00:30.529 
the needle but it didn't quite say was
you<00:00:28.830> pass<00:00:29.099> over<00:00:29.580> like<00:00:29.820> that<00:00:29.970> to<00:00:30.179> put<00:00:30.330> it<00:00:30.420> back

00:00:30.529 --> 00:00:30.539 
you pass over like that to put it back

00:00:30.539 --> 00:00:33.680 
you pass over like that to put it back
on<00:00:30.689> the<00:00:30.750> left<00:00:30.990> and<00:00:31.980> then<00:00:32.579> you<00:00:32.610> knit<00:00:33.329> through

00:00:33.680 --> 00:00:33.690 
on the left and then you knit through

00:00:33.690 --> 00:00:37.250 
on the left and then you knit through
this<00:00:33.870> one<00:00:34.200> and<00:00:35.040> the<00:00:35.730> back<00:00:36.030> of<00:00:36.420> this<00:00:36.660> next

00:00:37.250 --> 00:00:37.260 
this one and the back of this next

stitch<00:00:38.360> that<00:00:39.360> creates<00:00:41.000> two<00:00:42.000> from<00:00:42.719> three

00:00:43.360 --> 00:00:43.370 
stitch that creates two from three

00:00:43.370 --> 00:00:48.440 
stitch that creates two from three
paired<00:00:44.370> through<00:00:44.940> the<00:00:45.030> middle<00:00:46.460> now<00:00:47.460> this<00:00:48.300> could

00:00:48.440 --> 00:00:48.450 
paired through the middle now this could

00:00:48.450 --> 00:00:52.810 
paired through the middle now this could
also<00:00:48.660> be<00:00:48.960> done<00:00:49.110> by<00:00:49.739> knitting<00:00:50.070> two<00:00:50.399> together

00:00:52.810 --> 00:00:52.820 

00:00:52.820 --> 00:00:59.650 

taking<00:00:53.820> it<00:00:53.940> off<00:00:54.920> lifting<00:00:55.920> the<00:00:56.760> left<00:00:56.969> hand<00:00:57.239> leg

00:00:59.650 --> 00:00:59.660 

00:00:59.660 --> 00:01:03.889 

and<00:01:00.660> then<00:01:01.969> knitting<00:01:02.969> through<00:01:03.300> that<00:01:03.449> through

00:01:03.889 --> 00:01:03.899 
and then knitting through that through

00:01:03.899 --> 00:01:05.299 
and then knitting through that through
that<00:01:04.140> and<00:01:04.470> through<00:01:04.650> the<00:01:04.799> back<00:01:04.949> of<00:01:04.979> the<00:01:05.100> loop

00:01:05.299 --> 00:01:05.309 
that and through the back of the loop

00:01:05.309 --> 00:01:09.820 
that and through the back of the loop
for<00:01:05.580> the<00:01:05.909> next<00:01:06.150> one<00:01:06.299> the<00:01:07.110> same

00:01:09.820 --> 00:01:09.830 

00:01:09.830 --> 00:01:17.280 

now

00:01:17.280 --> 00:01:17.290 

00:01:17.290 --> 00:01:27.070 

personally<00:01:18.290> I<00:01:19.750> would<00:01:20.750> be<00:01:20.870> inclined<00:01:21.470> to<00:01:25.930> do<00:01:26.930> it

00:01:27.070 --> 00:01:27.080 
personally I would be inclined to do it

00:01:27.080 --> 00:01:35.290 
personally I would be inclined to do it
this<00:01:27.320> way<00:01:30.100> reorient<00:01:31.100> this<00:01:31.310> one<00:01:33.160> lift<00:01:34.160> and<00:01:35.150> do

00:01:35.290 --> 00:01:35.300 
this way reorient this one lift and do

00:01:35.300 --> 00:01:38.290 
this way reorient this one lift and do
it<00:01:35.950> because<00:01:36.950> I<00:01:37.220> don't<00:01:37.340> like<00:01:37.610> twisted<00:01:38.030> stitches

00:01:38.290 --> 00:01:38.300 
it because I don't like twisted stitches

00:01:38.300 --> 00:01:41.140 
it because I don't like twisted stitches
on<00:01:38.720> principle<00:01:39.760> because<00:01:40.760> I<00:01:40.790> like<00:01:41.030> everything

00:01:41.140 --> 00:01:41.150 
on principle because I like everything

00:01:41.150 --> 00:01:42.970 
on principle because I like everything
to<00:01:41.390> match<00:01:41.630> not<00:01:41.990> that<00:01:42.140> anyone<00:01:42.620> would<00:01:42.770> be<00:01:42.830> able

00:01:42.970 --> 00:01:42.980 
to match not that anyone would be able

00:01:42.980 --> 00:01:46.780 
to match not that anyone would be able
to<00:01:43.130> notice<00:01:44.590> so<00:01:45.590> doing<00:01:45.980> that<00:01:46.100> again<00:01:46.430> more

00:01:46.780 --> 00:01:46.790 
to notice so doing that again more

00:01:46.790 --> 00:01:53.740 
to notice so doing that again more
slowly<00:01:47.050> knit<00:01:48.050> two<00:01:48.230> together<00:01:50.830> reorient<00:01:52.750> in

00:01:53.740 --> 00:01:53.750 
slowly knit two together reorient in

00:01:53.750 --> 00:01:55.330 
slowly knit two together reorient in
other<00:01:53.930> words<00:01:54.110> slip<00:01:54.350> knit<00:01:54.500> wise<00:01:54.710> and<00:01:54.980> replace

00:01:55.330 --> 00:01:55.340 
other words slip knit wise and replace

00:01:55.340 --> 00:01:57.400 
other words slip knit wise and replace
back<00:01:55.640> on<00:01:55.790> the<00:01:55.880> left<00:01:56.060> hand<00:01:56.360> needle<00:01:56.510> and<00:01:56.780> then

00:01:57.400 --> 00:01:57.410 
back on the left hand needle and then

00:01:57.410 --> 00:02:01.600 
back on the left hand needle and then
lift<00:01:57.830> the<00:01:58.670> left<00:01:58.880> leg<00:01:59.530> of<00:02:00.530> the<00:02:00.980> previously

00:02:01.600 --> 00:02:01.610 
lift the left leg of the previously

00:02:01.610 --> 00:02:04.570 
lift the left leg of the previously
worked<00:02:01.910> stitch<00:02:02.410> and<00:02:03.410> knit<00:02:04.190> those<00:02:04.340> two

00:02:04.570 --> 00:02:04.580 
worked stitch and knit those two

00:02:04.580 --> 00:02:08.109 
worked stitch and knit those two
together<00:02:04.700> like<00:02:05.300> a<00:02:05.330> slip<00:02:05.630> slip<00:02:05.780> knit<00:02:05.840> I<00:02:07.119> think

00:02:08.109 --> 00:02:08.119 
together like a slip slip knit I think

00:02:08.119 --> 00:02:09.639 
together like a slip slip knit I think
that's<00:02:08.270> pretty<00:02:08.390> nifty<00:02:08.630> I<00:02:08.990> think<00:02:09.380> I've<00:02:09.500> seen

00:02:09.639 --> 00:02:09.649 
that's pretty nifty I think I've seen

00:02:09.649 --> 00:02:11.650 
that's pretty nifty I think I've seen
that<00:02:09.830> somewhere<00:02:10.040> before<00:02:10.190> I<00:02:10.730> don't<00:02:11.270> know<00:02:11.450> where

00:02:11.650 --> 00:02:11.660 
that somewhere before I don't know where

00:02:11.660 --> 00:02:14.710 
that somewhere before I don't know where
so<00:02:12.110> I<00:02:12.140> can't<00:02:12.380> cite<00:02:12.590> it
