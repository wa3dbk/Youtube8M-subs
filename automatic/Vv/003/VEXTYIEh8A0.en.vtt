00:00:04.220 --> 00:00:09.240
 of how to analyze videos in hd and with 

00:00:07.259 --> 00:00:10.860
 little good weight guys I'll have seen that 

00:00:09.240 --> 00:00:12.600
 not going up week I wanted to bring something 

00:00:10.860 --> 00:00:14.190
 something special that will help you a lot 

00:00:12.600 --> 00:00:16.109
 many people who have the desire to 

00:00:14.190 --> 00:00:18.870
 upload videos because this video is going 

00:00:16.109 --> 00:00:20.789
 help that I think enough here we are going to 

00:00:18.870 --> 00:00:22.289
 start teaching on staff and everything 

00:00:20.789 --> 00:00:24.000
 all kinds of things so you can 

00:00:22.289 --> 00:00:26.550
 trend to your videos in hd 's 

00:00:24.000 --> 00:00:30.449
 quality and with very little weight was gone 

00:00:26.550 --> 00:00:32.250
 to a ten-minute video at 1,080 to 300 

00:00:30.449 --> 00:00:34.110
 less 200 megas the truth that is 

00:00:32.250 --> 00:00:38.300
 pretty good at what I use as 

00:00:34.110 --> 00:00:45.450
 video that not many times but good 

00:00:38.300 --> 00:00:48.510
 let's see a prepared video worth here 

00:00:45.450 --> 00:00:50.879
 the video a video that has never risen 

00:00:48.510 --> 00:00:53.710
 the truth 

00:00:50.879 --> 00:00:55.420
 then we can here we put it here or 

00:00:53.710 --> 00:01:00.610
 directly like those that are here what 

00:00:55.420 --> 00:01:03.340
 you see here you can put the quality that 

00:01:00.610 --> 00:01:04.629
 you want to see preview what 

00:01:03.340 --> 00:01:05.979
 I buried analyze it so that the quality 

00:01:04.629 --> 00:01:08.440
 that I have why to put the best 

00:01:05.979 --> 00:01:09.700
 total the best in the best action and 

00:01:08.440 --> 00:01:11.770
 now they are different 

00:01:09.700 --> 00:01:13.810
 templates that there are to render in hd 

00:01:11.770 --> 00:01:16.780
 and quickly we go to this key that 

00:01:13.810 --> 00:01:18.850
 learn to raise as the truth is that 

00:01:16.780 --> 00:01:20.680
 forget and here we have two 

00:01:18.850 --> 00:01:23.050
 types of templates to analyze in hd 

00:01:20.680 --> 00:01:24.640
 and access with little weight I think we have 

00:01:23.050 --> 00:01:26.679
 the first one that is inside that the 

00:01:24.640 --> 00:01:28.330
 we can find online we can 

00:01:26.679 --> 00:01:29.920
 show file as they are I do not understand that 

00:01:28.330 --> 00:01:32.259
 you do not have it in favorites so I'm going to 

00:01:29.920 --> 00:01:34.950
 teach how you can as you can 

00:01:32.259 --> 00:01:34.950
 find the favorite 

00:01:36.000 --> 00:01:41.540
 for this was not good 

00:01:38.430 --> 00:01:41.540
 a boiling west 

00:01:42.410 --> 00:01:46.170
 ok is coinciding with the 

00:01:44.190 --> 00:01:48.600
 project conservation forget this 

00:01:46.170 --> 00:01:51.480
 if one thing are the axis of videos and so 

00:01:48.600 --> 00:01:54.210
 it's normal but well we do not have any 

00:01:51.480 --> 00:01:56.310
 problem here you see the folder that what 

00:01:54.210 --> 00:02:00.060
 I could find why they will come out 

00:01:56.310 --> 00:02:01.740
 these are the sections here then what 

00:02:00.060 --> 00:02:03.420
 that puts here the sections so that 

00:02:01.740 --> 00:02:05.190
 then you can find it in our house 

00:02:03.420 --> 00:02:07.140
 we have type of game we have this that 

00:02:05.190 --> 00:02:10.890
 is the standard ntsc definition for 

00:02:07.140 --> 00:02:14.000
 memory stick 256 and then be that 

00:02:10.890 --> 00:02:16.910
 template we can choose to configure the 

00:02:14.000 --> 00:02:18.980
 first time 

00:02:16.910 --> 00:02:20.300
 here in size then the quality as 

00:02:18.980 --> 00:02:23.690
 soccer and give the video you can put 

00:02:20.300 --> 00:02:25.610
 1280 x 720 720p which I recommend 

00:02:23.690 --> 00:02:27.530
 true a very good option or also 

00:02:25.610 --> 00:02:29.270
 you can put full hd that in 1920 with 

00:02:27.530 --> 00:02:31.340
 1080 and in this case I will set to high 

00:02:29.270 --> 00:02:33.850
 definition because I want the video 

00:02:31.340 --> 00:02:33.850
 next be 

00:02:35.230 --> 00:02:38.990
 here you have tones profiles you touch 

00:02:37.460 --> 00:02:40.700
 coding you do not touch this either 

00:02:38.990 --> 00:02:42.980
 neither do you touch it and this what you are going 

00:02:40.700 --> 00:02:45.250
 take out to touch in relation aspect what 

00:02:42.980 --> 00:02:50.140
 you are going to put in one 

00:02:45.250 --> 00:02:53.710
 you are going to put it in one here you have to have 

00:02:50.140 --> 00:02:55.180
 one way to decode this several 

00:02:53.710 --> 00:02:56.950
 options that and if you are 

00:02:55.180 --> 00:02:59.490
 options for my computer or something but I know 

00:02:56.950 --> 00:03:01.120
 which is being done looking for just acpu 

00:02:59.490 --> 00:03:02.680
 we would have a new play 

00:03:01.120 --> 00:03:04.900
 available this we're going to talk about after 

00:03:02.680 --> 00:03:07.810
 because he has got enough cloth 

00:03:04.900 --> 00:03:09.190
 let's go to the audio tab and here a 

00:03:07.810 --> 00:03:10.870
 important thing for the videos that yes 

00:03:09.190 --> 00:03:14.880
 much less and you can not tell the difference 

00:03:10.870 --> 00:03:17.950
 is you propose in 192 doing in 192,000 

00:03:14.880 --> 00:03:20.080
 you know how is this with the video os 

00:03:17.950 --> 00:03:22.360
 will go great, that is, it would be the same, 

00:03:20.080 --> 00:03:24.220
 you will notice almost the good difference speaking 

00:03:22.360 --> 00:03:25.840
 I have my car I do not know how I'll be 

00:03:24.220 --> 00:03:28.030
 listening and the truth is that they lower a 

00:03:25.840 --> 00:03:29.500
 heap of mb to andré's and such is 

00:03:28.030 --> 00:03:33.210
 now let's see we have the project 

00:03:29.500 --> 00:03:35.070
 that this one that put the best 

00:03:33.210 --> 00:03:37.290
 here you can quality the minister of vido 

00:03:35.070 --> 00:03:39.030
 the best always this the most important 

00:03:37.290 --> 00:03:40.650
 of the template the best I'm going to 

00:03:39.030 --> 00:03:43.080
 accept now you can analyze the video as 

00:03:40.650 --> 00:03:47.000
 I want to find it, you know where 

00:03:43.080 --> 00:03:50.430
 you are going to find these in the antonio bc 

00:03:47.000 --> 00:03:52.640
 bank nv ce what are you going to find this is 

00:03:50.430 --> 00:03:55.620
 template we talk to the system 

00:03:52.640 --> 00:03:58.650
 you are worth here to always check 

00:03:55.620 --> 00:04:01.110
 exist in gpu if you have gpu you give to 

00:03:58.650 --> 00:04:02.760
 use using the available gps because 

00:04:01.110 --> 00:04:04.980
 you have an intel card these 

00:04:02.760 --> 00:04:06.990
 options and that I have an envy then 

00:04:04.980 --> 00:04:10.040
 comes the integrated intel's so what 

00:04:06.990 --> 00:04:10.040
 I can also choose this option 

00:04:12.710 --> 00:04:16.890
 I recommend I recommend that you 

00:04:15.360 --> 00:04:18.420
 leave in automatic in recommended 

00:04:16.890 --> 00:04:20.640
 because I think the best option because 

00:04:18.420 --> 00:04:22.380
 they leave it in automatic the computer already 

00:04:20.640 --> 00:04:23.520
 will do the tests and see what it is 

00:04:22.380 --> 00:04:25.740
 the best so that your computer does not 

00:04:23.520 --> 00:04:28.020
 I know pt or anything like that or I think so 

00:04:25.740 --> 00:04:29.520
 better then you save template 

00:04:28.020 --> 00:04:31.280
 a very important thing is to be able 

00:04:29.520 --> 00:04:34.140
 analyze about the reaction of the loop 

00:04:31.280 --> 00:04:36.180
 when you go to perform you have the 

00:04:34.140 --> 00:04:37.620
 loop region do not have this because 

00:04:36.180 --> 00:04:38.729
 if not to render for example if 

00:04:37.620 --> 00:04:42.599
 you have 

00:04:38.729 --> 00:04:43.979
 if you have here this for example this is 

00:04:42.599 --> 00:04:45.779
 only to analyze this so we 

00:04:43.979 --> 00:04:47.759
 had these and then after analyzing how 

00:04:45.779 --> 00:04:50.099
 then I needed only the region of 

00:04:47.759 --> 00:04:51.629
 trot loop are going to use the region of the 

00:04:50.099 --> 00:04:53.610
 loop that is not going to channel everything 

00:04:51.629 --> 00:04:55.589
 so it's best to remove this and that 

00:04:53.610 --> 00:04:57.139
 they sell you I made the gold video and be 

00:04:55.589 --> 00:04:59.069
 seer what you have in this is here 

00:04:57.139 --> 00:05:00.599
 now let's see the other template that 

00:04:59.069 --> 00:05:03.029
 also a pretty good template 

00:05:00.599 --> 00:05:05.940
 although it is also very very good 

00:05:03.029 --> 00:05:09.060
 and now I'm going to teach 

00:05:05.940 --> 00:05:12.390
 with figures like this because the 

00:05:09.060 --> 00:05:13.710
 audio that the video for the video now 

00:05:12.390 --> 00:05:16.170
 the video you can choose different 

00:05:13.710 --> 00:05:17.670
 formats the different formats yo 

00:05:16.170 --> 00:05:21.750
 always said is wii the windows media 

00:05:17.670 --> 00:05:23.970
 video 9 in you know it's wmv point that I know 

00:05:21.750 --> 00:05:25.440
 I ask him so the truth that they look good and 

00:05:23.970 --> 00:05:27.390
 the very small size and reads the audio 

00:05:25.440 --> 00:05:29.520
 pretty good this leave with look 

00:05:27.390 --> 00:05:33.420
 square speed frames are 

00:05:29.520 --> 00:05:35.400
 could 29.97 from this efe this as 

00:05:33.420 --> 00:05:37.970
 this maximum 90 video output and they say 

00:05:35.400 --> 00:05:37.970
 if you want more 

00:05:40.690 --> 00:05:44.930
 málaga - mb I think but good what 

00:05:43.520 --> 00:05:47.540
 would leave maximum sharpness which is what I have 

00:05:44.930 --> 00:05:49.610
 brought life speed this I do not 

00:05:47.540 --> 00:05:52.010
 I have touched summary index, I have not 

00:05:49.610 --> 00:05:53.870
 touched and project and as always 

00:05:52.010 --> 00:05:56.060
 better I think it 's the best option is 

00:05:53.870 --> 00:05:57.410
 to need but good this template 

00:05:56.060 --> 00:05:59.360
 the truth is that it's pretty good but I 

00:05:57.410 --> 00:06:01.430
 I prefer this videos are very good 

00:05:59.360 --> 00:06:03.500
 the videos are very good and if we wanted 

00:06:01.430 --> 00:06:04.610
 and if we want to analyze about not with here 

00:06:03.500 --> 00:06:05.450
 the name that we want to keep 

00:06:04.610 --> 00:06:07.310
 Title 

00:06:05.450 --> 00:06:09.980
 let's examine and we can choose the 

00:06:07.310 --> 00:06:11.960
 folder that we want and good to have 

00:06:09.980 --> 00:06:13.670
 so videos are practiced almost at the beginning 

00:06:11.960 --> 00:06:16.070
 of all the basics of analyzing the video 

00:06:13.670 --> 00:06:18.910
 a template that I leave very good 

00:06:16.070 --> 00:06:21.800
 so that bless the videos in hd 

00:06:18.910 --> 00:06:23.900
 in two videos on hd 5 

00:06:21.800 --> 00:06:25.850
 a little what everyone looks for at 

00:06:23.900 --> 00:06:28.220
 start because there are people who 

00:06:25.850 --> 00:06:28.850
 beginning videos upload that this can 

00:06:28.220 --> 00:06:30.490
 take years 

00:06:28.850 --> 00:06:32.270
 with this done and if you have a 

00:06:30.490 --> 00:06:33.560
 computer the truth that you will go 

00:06:32.270 --> 00:06:38.570
 pretty good and I see it quite 

00:06:33.560 --> 00:06:40.460
 effective the video a video in which 

00:06:38.570 --> 00:06:41.960
 explains as much as possible how you can 

00:06:40.460 --> 00:06:43.460
 use in hd with little principle that 

00:06:41.960 --> 00:06:44.630
 the peaks great doing my steps 

00:06:43.460 --> 00:06:47.600
 especially with the first template 

00:06:44.630 --> 00:06:49.010
 doing my steps you will have all my life 

00:06:47.600 --> 00:06:51.530
 on youtube solve it like to upload 

00:06:49.010 --> 00:06:54.160
 videos and upload a video every week and 

00:06:51.530 --> 00:06:54.160
 that's not like me 

00:06:58.030 --> 00:07:04.180
 we share and do not forget the others
