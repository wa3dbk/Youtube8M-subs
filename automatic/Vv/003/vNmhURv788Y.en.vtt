we'll just do a quick walk around kind
of<00:00:07.740> show<00:00:08.160> some<00:00:08.340> of<00:00:08.400> the<00:00:08.460> features<00:00:08.570> so<00:00:09.570> you<00:00:09.660> can

00:00:09.770 --> 00:00:09.780 
of show some of the features so you can

00:00:09.780 --> 00:00:12.410 
of show some of the features so you can
see<00:00:09.929> that<00:00:10.139> it's<00:00:10.260> got<00:00:10.410> four<00:00:10.679> poles<00:00:10.950> and<00:00:11.730> it's

00:00:12.410 --> 00:00:12.420 
see that it's got four poles and it's

00:00:12.420 --> 00:00:14.450 
see that it's got four poles and it's
really<00:00:12.690> easy<00:00:12.900> to<00:00:12.990> set<00:00:13.230> up<00:00:13.290> because<00:00:13.710> the<00:00:14.190> poles

00:00:14.450 --> 00:00:14.460 
really easy to set up because the poles

00:00:14.460 --> 00:00:16.640 
really easy to set up because the poles
are<00:00:14.610> color<00:00:14.820> coded<00:00:15.089> to<00:00:15.420> the<00:00:16.109> grommets<00:00:16.590> and

00:00:16.640 --> 00:00:16.650 
are color coded to the grommets and

00:00:16.650 --> 00:00:19.189 
are color coded to the grommets and
where<00:00:16.770> they<00:00:16.890> go<00:00:17.039> so<00:00:17.070> you<00:00:17.310> have<00:00:17.520> the<00:00:17.840> the<00:00:18.840> orange

00:00:19.189 --> 00:00:19.199 
where they go so you have the the orange

00:00:19.199 --> 00:00:21.290 
where they go so you have the the orange
poles<00:00:19.439> here<00:00:19.770> and<00:00:19.949> they're<00:00:20.490> actually<00:00:20.820> all<00:00:21.000> one

00:00:21.290 --> 00:00:21.300 
poles here and they're actually all one

00:00:21.300 --> 00:00:24.019 
poles here and they're actually all one
piece<00:00:21.570> because<00:00:22.199> they<00:00:22.410> connected<00:00:22.859> that<00:00:22.949> hub<00:00:23.250> so

00:00:24.019 --> 00:00:24.029 
piece because they connected that hub so

00:00:24.029 --> 00:00:25.099 
piece because they connected that hub so
you<00:00:24.119> can't<00:00:24.330> lose<00:00:24.480> them<00:00:24.630> or<00:00:24.720> anything<00:00:24.900> because

00:00:25.099 --> 00:00:25.109 
you can't lose them or anything because

00:00:25.109 --> 00:00:26.359 
you can't lose them or anything because
they're<00:00:25.320> attacks<00:00:25.590> which<00:00:25.800> is<00:00:25.920> awesome<00:00:26.250> and

00:00:26.359 --> 00:00:26.369 
they're attacks which is awesome and

00:00:26.369 --> 00:00:29.689 
they're attacks which is awesome and
then<00:00:27.060> you<00:00:27.180> just<00:00:27.390> put<00:00:27.840> those<00:00:28.019> up<00:00:28.289> and<00:00:28.550> then<00:00:29.550> they

00:00:29.689 --> 00:00:29.699 
then you just put those up and then they

00:00:29.699 --> 00:00:32.269 
then you just put those up and then they
go<00:00:29.910> down<00:00:30.090> to<00:00:30.240> the<00:00:30.449> to<00:00:31.349> the<00:00:31.439> orange<00:00:31.859> grommets

00:00:32.269 --> 00:00:32.279 
go down to the to the orange grommets

00:00:32.279 --> 00:00:35.450 
go down to the to the orange grommets
and<00:00:32.809> stake<00:00:33.809> out<00:00:33.899> points<00:00:34.230> here<00:00:34.469> and<00:00:35.040> then<00:00:35.399> you

00:00:35.450 --> 00:00:35.460 
and stake out points here and then you

00:00:35.460 --> 00:00:38.119 
and stake out points here and then you
have<00:00:35.489> the<00:00:35.700> silver<00:00:35.940> poles<00:00:36.500> that<00:00:37.500> run<00:00:37.800> this<00:00:37.950> way

00:00:38.119 --> 00:00:38.129 
have the silver poles that run this way

00:00:38.129 --> 00:00:41.869 
have the silver poles that run this way
and<00:00:39.200> they<00:00:40.200> go<00:00:40.350> to<00:00:40.410> the<00:00:40.649> silver<00:00:41.550> stake<00:00:41.760> out

00:00:41.869 --> 00:00:41.879 
and they go to the silver stake out

00:00:41.879 --> 00:00:45.500 
and they go to the silver stake out
points<00:00:42.149> and<00:00:42.239> grommets<00:00:42.540> there<00:00:42.690> so<00:00:44.390> you've<00:00:45.390> got

00:00:45.500 --> 00:00:45.510 
points and grommets there so you've got

00:00:45.510 --> 00:00:48.410 
points and grommets there so you've got
a<00:00:45.539> door<00:00:45.780> here<00:00:46.050> and<00:00:46.550> it's<00:00:47.550> all<00:00:47.730> mesh<00:00:48.000> and<00:00:48.270> then<00:00:48.360> a

00:00:48.410 --> 00:00:48.420 
a door here and it's all mesh and then a

00:00:48.420 --> 00:00:50.060 
a door here and it's all mesh and then a
nylon<00:00:48.750> inner<00:00:48.989> and<00:00:49.320> now<00:00:49.410> in<00:00:49.710> there<00:00:49.860> set<00:00:50.039> up

00:00:50.060 --> 00:00:50.070 
nylon inner and now in there set up

00:00:50.070 --> 00:00:51.860 
nylon inner and now in there set up
right<00:00:50.309> now<00:00:50.430> so<00:00:51.239> you<00:00:51.329> can't<00:00:51.510> see<00:00:51.629> through<00:00:51.750> the

00:00:51.860 --> 00:00:51.870 
right now so you can't see through the

00:01:10.640 --> 00:01:10.650 
then it's really easy to set up because

00:01:10.650 --> 00:01:12.800 
then it's really easy to set up because
it<00:01:10.710> has<00:01:10.799> the<00:01:10.950> clips<00:01:11.250> so<00:01:12.060> here's<00:01:12.240> a<00:01:12.330> single<00:01:12.510> clip

00:01:12.800 --> 00:01:12.810 
it has the clips so here's a single clip

00:01:12.810 --> 00:01:14.630 
it has the clips so here's a single clip
and<00:01:13.470> this<00:01:13.619> is<00:01:13.770> double<00:01:14.100> click<00:01:14.250> for<00:01:14.280> where<00:01:14.549> the

00:01:14.630 --> 00:01:14.640 
and this is double click for where the

00:01:14.640 --> 00:01:17.690 
and this is double click for where the
poles<00:01:14.850> intersect<00:01:15.299> and<00:01:16.310> we're<00:01:17.310> coming<00:01:17.549> here

00:01:17.690 --> 00:01:17.700 
poles intersect and we're coming here

00:01:17.700 --> 00:01:20.390 
poles intersect and we're coming here
and<00:01:17.880> I<00:01:18.030> have<00:01:18.540> the<00:01:18.659> full<00:01:18.840> door<00:01:19.110> down<00:01:19.350> and<00:01:19.530> it

00:01:23.179 --> 00:01:23.189 
just stubs and stuffs into a little mesh

00:01:23.189 --> 00:01:24.980 
just stubs and stuffs into a little mesh
pocket<00:01:23.580> over<00:01:23.670> here<00:01:23.790> so<00:01:24.119> off<00:01:24.299> to<00:01:24.420> the<00:01:24.509> side<00:01:24.750> you

pocket over here so off to the side you
see<00:01:25.680> there's<00:01:25.860> another<00:01:25.979> mesh<00:01:26.310> pocket<00:01:26.700> there

00:01:26.980 --> 00:01:26.990 
see there's another mesh pocket there

00:01:26.990 --> 00:01:29.840 
see there's another mesh pocket there
one<00:01:27.990> over<00:01:28.020> in<00:01:28.320> that<00:01:28.409> corner<00:01:28.549> another<00:01:29.549> one<00:01:29.759> for

00:01:29.840 --> 00:01:29.850 
one over in that corner another one for

00:01:29.850 --> 00:01:31.249 
one over in that corner another one for
the<00:01:29.970> door<00:01:30.150> then<00:01:30.390> another<00:01:30.600> mesh<00:01:30.869> pocket

another one over here then we also have

00:01:34.500 --> 00:01:37.490 
another one over here then we also have
some<00:01:34.799> internal<00:01:35.729> loops<00:01:36.110> you<00:01:37.110> can<00:01:37.259> kind<00:01:37.439> of

00:01:37.490 --> 00:01:37.500 
some internal loops you can kind of

00:01:37.500 --> 00:01:40.069 
some internal loops you can kind of
latch<00:01:37.710> together<00:01:38.070> for<00:01:38.310> interior<00:01:39.079> guideline

00:01:40.069 --> 00:01:40.079

one in the back also has a window but

00:03:14.200 --> 00:03:15.240 
one in the back also has a window but
you<00:03:14.230> don't<00:03:14.380> have<00:03:14.470> to<00:03:14.560> worry<00:03:14.739> about<00:03:14.829> privacy

because the nylon inner doors can be

00:03:17.440 --> 00:03:20.280 
because the nylon inner doors can be
zipped<00:03:17.650> shut<00:03:17.739> so<00:03:17.980> no<00:03:18.100> one<00:03:18.220> can<00:03:18.310> see<00:03:18.459> you<00:03:19.290> and

00:03:28.830 --> 00:03:28.840 
hook on the end which just closes it up

00:03:28.840 --> 00:03:29.310

velcro<00:03:31.709> because<00:03:32.709> if<00:03:33.549> we<00:03:33.640> run<00:03:33.820> smoothly<00:03:34.120> all

00:03:34.289 --> 00:03:34.299 
velcro because if we run smoothly all

00:03:34.299 --> 00:03:35.960 
velcro because if we run smoothly all
the<00:03:34.390> zippers<00:03:34.660> in<00:03:34.720> the<00:03:34.750> tent<00:03:34.989> run<00:03:35.140> smoothly<00:03:35.440> and

the zippers in the tent run smoothly and
you<00:03:36.970> can<00:03:37.120> tie<00:03:37.269> it<00:03:37.329> back<00:03:37.480> with<00:03:37.720> two<00:03:37.870> little<00:03:38.140> ties

00:03:38.280 --> 00:03:38.290 
you can tie it back with two little ties

00:03:38.290 --> 00:03:39.840 
you can tie it back with two little ties
but<00:03:38.530> we'll<00:03:38.620> just<00:03:38.650> flip<00:03:38.890> it<00:03:38.980> open<00:03:39.070> for<00:03:39.370> now<00:03:39.459> and

00:03:39.840 --> 00:03:39.850
