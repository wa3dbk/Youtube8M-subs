look<00:02:30.260> you're<00:02:31.040> you're<00:02:31.370> being<00:02:31.580> silly<00:02:31.910> here<00:02:32.240> and

00:02:32.410 --> 00:02:32.420 
look you're you're being silly here and

00:02:32.420 --> 00:02:34.360 
look you're you're being silly here and
I<00:02:32.570> look<00:02:32.990> I<00:02:33.230> know<00:02:33.530> it's<00:02:33.770> in<00:02:33.890> your<00:02:34.040> time<00:02:34.340> of

00:02:34.360 --> 00:02:34.370 
I look I know it's in your time of

hurting<00:02:34.970> and<00:02:35.120> mourning<00:02:35.780> but<00:02:38.590> it's<00:02:39.590> like<00:02:39.830> we

00:02:40.000 --> 00:02:40.010 
hurting and mourning but it's like we

00:02:40.010 --> 00:02:42.280 
hurting and mourning but it's like we
can't<00:02:40.340> have<00:02:40.610> normal<00:02:41.000> human<00:02:41.150> relations<00:02:41.780> right

00:02:42.290 --> 00:02:45.640 
can't have normal human relations right
and<00:02:42.530> so<00:02:43.160> we<00:02:43.459> displace<00:02:44.209> what's<00:02:44.989> going<00:02:45.260> wrong<00:02:45.440> in

00:02:45.640 --> 00:02:45.650
