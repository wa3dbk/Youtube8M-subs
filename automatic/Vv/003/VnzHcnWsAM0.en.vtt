00:02:14.770 --> 00:02:16.140 
this tape measure which is our got
really<00:02:14.800> cheap<00:02:15.280> are<00:02:15.430> not<00:02:15.550> this<00:02:15.670> one<00:02:15.850> I<00:02:15.940> was<00:02:16.030> in

00:02:16.140 --> 00:02:16.150 
really cheap are not this one I was in

00:02:16.150 --> 00:02:19.290 
really cheap are not this one I was in
New<00:02:16.240> York<00:02:16.510> it<00:02:16.810> was<00:02:16.870> like<00:02:16.990> a<00:02:17.020> dollar<00:02:17.320> maybe<00:02:18.300> and

00:02:19.290 --> 00:02:19.300 
New York it was like a dollar maybe and

00:02:19.300 --> 00:02:21.330 
New York it was like a dollar maybe and
as<00:02:19.959> you<00:02:20.050> can<00:02:20.170> see<00:02:20.200> it<00:02:20.470> doesn't<00:02:20.620> start<00:02:20.920> exactly

00:02:21.330 --> 00:02:21.340 
as you can see it doesn't start exactly

00:02:21.340 --> 00:02:23.460 
as you can see it doesn't start exactly
at<00:02:21.580> zero<00:02:22.060> so<00:02:22.270> I'm<00:02:22.360> going<00:02:22.510> to<00:02:22.540> cut<00:02:22.780> off<00:02:22.810> like<00:02:23.080> I'm

00:02:23.460 --> 00:02:23.470 
at zero so I'm going to cut off like I'm

00:02:23.470 --> 00:02:25.320 
at zero so I'm going to cut off like I'm
gonna<00:02:23.620> I'm<00:02:24.040> gonna<00:02:24.250> make<00:02:24.580> sure<00:02:24.610> it<00:02:24.910> starts<00:02:25.209> at

00:02:25.320 --> 00:02:25.330 
gonna I'm gonna make sure it starts at

00:02:25.330 --> 00:02:27.410 
gonna I'm gonna make sure it starts at
zero<00:02:25.600> and<00:02:25.870> measure<00:02:26.560> out<00:02:26.709> so<00:02:27.040> I'm<00:02:27.130> going<00:02:27.280> to

00:02:27.410 --> 00:02:27.420 
zero and measure out so I'm going to

00:02:27.420 --> 00:02:29.640 
zero and measure out so I'm going to
measure<00:02:28.420> different<00:02:28.930> parts<00:02:29.260> of<00:02:29.290> my<00:02:29.350> hair

00:02:29.640 --> 00:02:29.650 
measure different parts of my hair

00:02:29.650 --> 00:02:32.490 
measure different parts of my hair
because<00:02:30.430> I<00:02:30.730> realized<00:02:31.120> that<00:02:31.480> my<00:02:31.840> hair<00:02:32.230> is<00:02:32.260> gonna

00:02:32.490 --> 00:02:32.500 
because I realized that my hair is gonna

00:02:32.500 --> 00:02:35.370 
because I realized that my hair is gonna
be<00:02:32.680> growing<00:02:33.130> or<00:02:33.459> my<00:02:34.030> hair<00:02:34.239> grows<00:02:34.480> at<00:02:34.989> different

00:02:35.370 --> 00:02:35.380 
be growing or my hair grows at different

00:02:35.380 --> 00:02:56.720 
be growing or my hair grows at different
rates<00:02:35.500> around<00:02:36.430> my<00:02:36.730> hair<00:02:36.910> so<00:02:37.150> it's

00:02:56.720 --> 00:02:56.730 

00:02:56.730 --> 00:02:59.100 

alright<00:02:57.730> so<00:02:57.940> you<00:02:58.060> can<00:02:58.210> see<00:02:58.450> that<00:02:58.480> different

00:02:59.100 --> 00:02:59.110 
alright so you can see that different

00:02:59.110 --> 00:03:00.840 
alright so you can see that different
eyes<00:02:59.200> of<00:02:59.350> my<00:02:59.440> hair<00:02:59.710> definitely<00:03:00.070> do<00:03:00.640> have

00:03:00.840 --> 00:03:00.850 
eyes of my hair definitely do have

00:03:00.850 --> 00:03:03.690 
eyes of my hair definitely do have
different<00:03:01.090> lengths<00:03:01.830> the<00:03:02.830> longest<00:03:03.220> part<00:03:03.460> of<00:03:03.580> my

00:03:03.690 --> 00:03:03.700 
different lengths the longest part of my

00:03:03.700 --> 00:03:05.610 
different lengths the longest part of my
ear<00:03:03.970> was<00:03:04.210> actually<00:03:04.630> right<00:03:04.960> in<00:03:04.990> here<00:03:05.410> in<00:03:05.500> the

00:03:05.610 --> 00:03:05.620 
ear was actually right in here in the

00:03:05.620 --> 00:03:09.930 
ear was actually right in here in the
center<00:03:05.950> um<00:03:07.350> so<00:03:08.350> I<00:03:08.890> don't<00:03:09.280> know<00:03:09.370> if<00:03:09.610> that<00:03:09.790> means

00:03:09.930 --> 00:03:09.940 
center um so I don't know if that means

00:03:09.940 --> 00:03:11.970 
center um so I don't know if that means
it<00:03:10.120> grows<00:03:10.360> faster<00:03:10.840> oil<00:03:11.020> it<00:03:11.230> was<00:03:11.470> just<00:03:11.680> will<00:03:11.890> not

00:03:11.970 --> 00:03:11.980 
it grows faster oil it was just will not

00:03:11.980 --> 00:03:15.300
