00:05:10.120 --> 00:05:17.490 
and me out of the team understand you
really<00:05:10.840> well<00:05:10.960> and<00:05:12.660> GM<00:05:13.660> ma<00:05:14.230> is<00:05:15.330> he<00:05:16.330> really<00:05:16.840> good

00:05:17.490 --> 00:05:17.500 
really well and GM ma is he really good

00:05:17.500 --> 00:05:22.290 
really well and GM ma is he really good
as<00:05:17.740> a<00:05:17.820> eternal<00:05:18.820> envia<00:05:19.120> was<00:05:19.920> well<00:05:20.920> and<00:05:21.160> I<00:05:22.060> think

00:05:22.290 --> 00:05:22.300 
as a eternal envia was well and I think

00:05:22.300 --> 00:05:24.720 
as a eternal envia was well and I think
they<00:05:22.630> have<00:05:22.810> different<00:05:23.080> play<00:05:23.980> styles<00:05:24.010> they

00:05:24.720 --> 00:05:24.730 
they have different play styles they

00:05:24.730 --> 00:05:26.190 
they have different play styles they
don't<00:05:25.090> look<00:05:25.240> at<00:05:25.420> the<00:05:25.510> game<00:05:25.690> in<00:05:25.810> the<00:05:25.870> same<00:05:26.020> way

00:05:26.190 --> 00:05:26.200 
don't look at the game in the same way

00:05:26.200 --> 00:05:31.380 
don't look at the game in the same way
and<00:05:26.940> I<00:05:27.940> think<00:05:28.750> he<00:05:29.170> gem<00:05:29.440> is<00:05:29.650> more<00:05:30.130> clutch<00:05:30.580> in<00:05:31.270> a

00:05:31.380 --> 00:05:31.390 
and I think he gem is more clutch in a

00:05:31.390 --> 00:05:35.520 
and I think he gem is more clutch in a
clutch<00:05:31.660> player<00:05:32.010> like<00:05:33.010> him<00:05:33.420> he<00:05:34.420> does<00:05:34.630> he<00:05:35.020> has<00:05:35.200> a

00:05:35.520 --> 00:05:35.530 
clutch player like him he does he has a

00:05:35.530 --> 00:05:38.150 
clutch player like him he does he has a
lot<00:05:36.400> of<00:05:36.430> impacting<00:05:37.000> it<00:05:37.150> in<00:05:37.300> the<00:05:37.450> games<00:05:37.660> like

00:05:38.150 --> 00:05:38.160 
lot of impacting it in the games like

00:05:38.160 --> 00:05:42.270 
lot of impacting it in the games like
yes<00:05:39.300> it's<00:05:40.300> like<00:05:40.600> he's<00:05:40.810> a<00:05:40.840> Solomon<00:05:41.500> that<00:05:41.680> much

00:05:42.270 --> 00:05:42.280 
yes it's like he's a Solomon that much

00:05:42.280 --> 00:05:46.260 
yes it's like he's a Solomon that much
impact<00:05:42.640> so<00:05:43.420> those<00:05:44.320> supports<00:05:44.740> are<00:05:44.860> greater<00:05:45.270> can

00:05:46.260 --> 00:05:46.270 
impact so those supports are greater can

00:05:46.270 --> 00:05:51.390 
impact so those supports are greater can
team<00:05:46.950> not<00:05:47.950> listen<00:05:48.910> you<00:05:49.090> or<00:05:49.360> can<00:05:50.230> they<00:05:50.440> just<00:05:50.950> do

00:05:51.390 --> 00:05:51.400
