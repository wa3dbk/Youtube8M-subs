00:02:25.210 --> 00:02:25.220 
did a couple of minor suspension

00:02:25.220 --> 00:02:27.490 
did a couple of minor suspension
clickers<00:02:25.550> on<00:02:25.730> it<00:02:25.910> we<00:02:26.840> were<00:02:26.959> happy<00:02:27.230> with<00:02:27.350> them

00:02:27.490 --> 00:02:27.500

00:02:33.850 --> 00:02:33.860 
think we put maybe 15 minutes of riding

00:02:33.860 --> 00:02:36.070 
think we put maybe 15 minutes of riding
on<00:02:34.100> at<00:02:34.220> five<00:02:34.430> minutes<00:02:34.730> each<00:02:34.820> and<00:02:35.209> we<00:02:35.750> both<00:02:35.930> came

00:02:36.070 --> 00:02:36.080

on at five minutes each and we both came
back<00:02:36.260> and<00:02:36.440> just<00:02:36.620> think<00:02:37.160> we<00:02:37.250> move<00:02:37.459> the<00:02:37.610> brake

00:02:37.900 --> 00:02:37.910 
back and just think we move the brake

00:02:37.910 --> 00:02:39.850 
back and just think we move the brake
lever<00:02:38.209> down<00:02:38.930> a<00:02:38.989> little<00:02:39.260> bit
