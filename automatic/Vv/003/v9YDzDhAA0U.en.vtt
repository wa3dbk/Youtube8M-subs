this quick DIY at homemade shock mount

00:00:08.370 --> 00:00:12.110 
this quick DIY at homemade shock mount
for<00:00:08.700> my<00:00:08.820> zoom<00:00:09.059> h1<00:00:09.269> handy<00:00:09.809> recorder<00:00:10.219> I<00:00:11.219> use<00:00:11.969> this

00:00:12.110 --> 00:00:12.120 
for my zoom h1 handy recorder I use this

00:00:12.120 --> 00:00:14.240 
for my zoom h1 handy recorder I use this
thing<00:00:12.179> for<00:00:12.389> my<00:00:12.750> DSLR<00:00:13.170> audio<00:00:13.650> actually<00:00:14.070> picked

00:00:14.240 --> 00:00:14.250 
thing for my DSLR audio actually picked

00:00:14.250 --> 00:00:16.490 
thing for my DSLR audio actually picked
it<00:00:14.340> up<00:00:14.460> just<00:00:14.700> recently<00:00:15.120> it's<00:00:15.690> on<00:00:15.809> the<00:00:15.929> 5d<00:00:16.289> mark

00:00:16.490 --> 00:00:16.500 
it up just recently it's on the 5d mark

00:00:16.500 --> 00:00:21.320 
it up just recently it's on the 5d mark
ii<00:00:16.560> with<00:00:17.070> the<00:00:17.190> 24<00:00:17.910> to<00:00:18.029> 105<00:00:18.449> f/4<00:00:18.960> l<00:00:18.990> is<00:00:19.550> so<00:00:20.550> the

00:00:21.320 --> 00:00:21.330 
ii with the 24 to 105 f/4 l is so the

00:00:21.330 --> 00:00:22.849 
ii with the 24 to 105 f/4 l is so the
reason<00:00:21.869> that<00:00:21.960> you<00:00:22.080> might<00:00:22.230> want<00:00:22.529> one<00:00:22.590> of<00:00:22.710> these

00:00:27.859 --> 00:00:27.869 
of running gun style DSLR audio is

00:00:27.869 --> 00:00:31.970 
of running gun style DSLR audio is
because<00:00:28.769> the<00:00:29.609> the<00:00:30.119> onboard<00:00:30.630> mic<00:00:30.900> and<00:00:31.199> any<00:00:31.650> mic

00:00:31.970 --> 00:00:31.980 
because the the onboard mic and any mic

00:00:31.980 --> 00:00:33.940 
because the the onboard mic and any mic
that's<00:00:32.279> attached<00:00:32.640> directly<00:00:32.940> to<00:00:33.300> the<00:00:33.540> the

00:00:33.940 --> 00:00:33.950 
that's attached directly to the the

00:00:33.950 --> 00:00:36.620 
that's attached directly to the the
camera<00:00:34.950> it's<00:00:35.489> going<00:00:35.640> to<00:00:35.760> pick<00:00:36.000> up<00:00:36.120> any<00:00:36.360> noise

00:00:36.620 --> 00:00:36.630 
camera it's going to pick up any noise

00:00:36.630 --> 00:00:39.619 
camera it's going to pick up any noise
from<00:00:36.660> handling<00:00:37.440> it<00:00:37.620> so<00:00:38.070> for<00:00:38.280> example<00:00:38.760> using

00:00:39.619 --> 00:00:39.629 
from handling it so for example using

00:00:39.629 --> 00:00:43.880 
from handling it so for example using
the<00:00:39.750> onboard<00:00:39.899> mic<00:00:40.469> right<00:00:40.739> now<00:00:40.950> if<00:00:41.640> i<00:00:41.850> zoom<00:00:42.890> in

00:00:43.880 --> 00:00:43.890 
the onboard mic right now if i zoom in

00:00:43.890 --> 00:00:48.670 
the onboard mic right now if i zoom in
and<00:00:44.040> out<00:00:45.469> you're<00:00:46.469> probably<00:00:46.680> gonna<00:00:46.890> hear<00:00:47.100> that

00:00:48.670 --> 00:00:48.680 
and out you're probably gonna hear that

00:00:48.680 --> 00:00:52.069 
and out you're probably gonna hear that
but<00:00:49.680> with<00:00:49.860> the<00:00:50.149> h1<00:00:51.149> in<00:00:51.420> the<00:00:51.600> shock<00:00:51.809> mount

00:00:52.069 --> 00:00:52.079 
but with the h1 in the shock mount

00:00:52.079 --> 00:00:53.959 
but with the h1 in the shock mount
you're<00:00:52.379> not<00:00:52.559> gonna<00:00:52.710> hear<00:00:52.920> that<00:00:53.129> same<00:00:53.789> thing

00:00:53.959 --> 00:00:53.969 
you're not gonna hear that same thing

00:00:53.969 --> 00:00:56.029 
you're not gonna hear that same thing
with<00:00:54.000> focusing<00:00:54.570> if<00:00:54.840> I<00:00:55.020> rack<00:00:55.260> to<00:00:55.559> the<00:00:55.590> camera

00:00:56.029 --> 00:00:56.039 
with focusing if I rack to the camera

00:00:56.039 --> 00:01:03.110 
with focusing if I rack to the camera
and<00:00:56.160> back<00:01:01.340> now<00:01:02.340> you're<00:01:02.489> probably<00:01:02.640> gonna<00:01:02.879> hear

00:01:03.110 --> 00:01:03.120 
and back now you're probably gonna hear

00:01:03.120 --> 00:01:05.450 
and back now you're probably gonna hear
that<00:01:03.180> using<00:01:03.629> the<00:01:03.719> internal<00:01:04.080> mic<00:01:04.350> or<00:01:04.860> any<00:01:05.280> mic

00:01:05.450 --> 00:01:05.460 
that using the internal mic or any mic

00:01:05.460 --> 00:01:07.880 
that using the internal mic or any mic
that's<00:01:05.700> direct<00:01:06.119> mounted<00:01:06.570> to<00:01:06.689> the<00:01:06.780> camera<00:01:07.229> but

00:01:07.880 --> 00:01:07.890 
that's direct mounted to the camera but

00:01:07.890 --> 00:01:09.740 
that's direct mounted to the camera but
with<00:01:08.010> the<00:01:08.100> shock<00:01:08.340> mount<00:01:08.640> you're<00:01:09.240> not<00:01:09.479> going<00:01:09.689> to

00:01:09.740 --> 00:01:09.750 
with the shock mount you're not going to

00:01:09.750 --> 00:01:11.570 
with the shock mount you're not going to
hear<00:01:09.869> that<00:01:09.930> handling<00:01:10.530> noise<00:01:10.680> same<00:01:11.460> with

00:01:11.570 --> 00:01:11.580 
hear that handling noise same with

00:01:11.580 --> 00:01:13.760 
hear that handling noise same with
adjusting<00:01:12.030> your<00:01:12.150> grid<00:01:12.420> if<00:01:13.229> you're<00:01:13.470> on<00:01:13.619> the

00:01:13.760 --> 00:01:13.770 
adjusting your grid if you're on the

00:01:13.770 --> 00:01:15.679 
adjusting your grid if you're on the
camera<00:01:14.010> and<00:01:14.369> you<00:01:14.490> have<00:01:14.610> to<00:01:14.700> change<00:01:14.970> grip<00:01:15.330> or

00:01:15.679 --> 00:01:15.689 
camera and you have to change grip or

00:01:15.689 --> 00:01:17.899 
camera and you have to change grip or
you<00:01:16.140> need<00:01:16.290> to<00:01:16.320> move<00:01:16.619> it<00:01:16.860> or<00:01:17.100> you<00:01:17.310> handle<00:01:17.820> it

00:01:17.899 --> 00:01:17.909 
you need to move it or you handle it

00:01:17.909 --> 00:01:20.450 
you need to move it or you handle it
roughly<00:01:18.270> for<00:01:18.540> some<00:01:18.720> reason<00:01:19.049> all<00:01:19.770> that's<00:01:20.220> going

00:01:20.450 --> 00:01:20.460 
roughly for some reason all that's going

00:01:20.460 --> 00:01:22.130 
roughly for some reason all that's going
to<00:01:20.520> translate<00:01:20.939> through<00:01:21.299> directly<00:01:21.659> into<00:01:22.020> the

00:01:22.130 --> 00:01:22.140 
to translate through directly into the

00:01:22.140 --> 00:01:24.770 
to translate through directly into the
sound<00:01:22.409> of<00:01:22.619> the<00:01:22.710> camera<00:01:23.130> but<00:01:24.000> not<00:01:24.210> so<00:01:24.540> if<00:01:24.659> you

00:01:24.770 --> 00:01:24.780 
sound of the camera but not so if you

00:01:24.780 --> 00:01:26.690 
sound of the camera but not so if you
have<00:01:24.869> a<00:01:24.930> shock<00:01:25.200> mount<00:01:25.439> so<00:01:26.310> what<00:01:26.430> I'll<00:01:26.520> do<00:01:26.670> right

00:01:26.690 --> 00:01:26.700 
have a shock mount so what I'll do right

00:01:26.700 --> 00:01:30.050 
have a shock mount so what I'll do right
now<00:01:27.030> is<00:01:27.270> all<00:01:28.020> I'll<00:01:28.860> do<00:01:29.009> the<00:01:29.130> audio<00:01:29.460> from<00:01:29.759> the

00:01:30.050 --> 00:01:30.060 
now is all I'll do the audio from the

00:01:30.060 --> 00:01:33.590 
now is all I'll do the audio from the
shock<00:01:30.450> mount<00:01:31.820> so<00:01:32.820> now<00:01:32.970> you<00:01:33.030> can<00:01:33.210> hear<00:01:33.329> a<00:01:33.360> shock

00:01:33.590 --> 00:01:33.600 
shock mount so now you can hear a shock

00:01:33.600 --> 00:01:39.550 
shock mount so now you can hear a shock
mount

00:01:39.550 --> 00:01:39.560 

00:01:39.560 --> 00:01:41.690
