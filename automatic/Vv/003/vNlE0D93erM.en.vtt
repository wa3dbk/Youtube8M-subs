00:00:14.280 --> 00:00:15.820 
league-wide NBA preview series I'll
start<00:00:14.610> with<00:00:14.670> the<00:00:14.790> landscape<00:00:15.269> out<00:00:15.450> west

00:00:15.820 --> 00:00:15.830 
start with the landscape out west

00:00:15.830 --> 00:00:17.720 
start with the landscape out west
although<00:00:16.830> there<00:00:17.010> have<00:00:17.160> been<00:00:17.400> some

00:00:17.720 --> 00:00:17.730 
although there have been some

00:00:17.730 --> 00:00:20.090 
although there have been some
significant<00:00:18.330> changes<00:00:18.830> most<00:00:19.830> of<00:00:19.980> the

00:00:20.090 --> 00:00:20.100 
significant changes most of the

00:00:20.100 --> 00:00:21.950 
significant changes most of the
hierarchy<00:00:20.340> is<00:00:20.880> may<00:00:21.119> remain<00:00:21.449> pretty<00:00:21.720> much

00:00:21.950 --> 00:00:21.960 
hierarchy is may remain pretty much

00:00:21.960 --> 00:00:24.140 
hierarchy is may remain pretty much
intact<00:00:22.410> and<00:00:22.859> then<00:00:23.369> I<00:00:23.460> think<00:00:23.670> this<00:00:23.760> season

00:00:24.140 --> 00:00:24.150 
intact and then I think this season

00:00:24.150 --> 00:00:25.970 
intact and then I think this season
we're<00:00:24.300> going<00:00:24.420> to<00:00:24.480> see<00:00:24.779> the<00:00:25.500> new<00:00:25.830> orleans

hornets the Kings the rockets and the
Trail<00:00:34.739> Blazers<00:00:34.880> at<00:00:35.880> the<00:00:36.180> bottom<00:00:36.480> of<00:00:36.630> the

Trail Blazers at the bottom of the

00:00:36.930 --> 00:00:39.170 
Trail Blazers at the bottom of the
conference<00:00:37.410> which<00:00:37.980> leaves<00:00:38.190> some<00:00:38.879> room<00:00:38.910> in<00:00:39.090> the

00:00:39.170 --> 00:00:39.180 
conference which leaves some room in the

00:00:39.180 --> 00:00:41.410

00:00:43.970 --> 00:00:43.980 
space is seven through 11 and I think

00:00:43.980 --> 00:00:45.619

like that that have been a detriment so

00:03:03.269 --> 00:03:05.240 
like that that have been a detriment so
he<00:03:03.750> needs<00:03:03.900> to<00:03:04.110> learn<00:03:04.230> to<00:03:04.290> play<00:03:04.860> with<00:03:05.099> that

that as this sophomore season goes on
for<00:03:12.330> him<00:03:12.510> I<00:03:12.690> think<00:03:13.200> he<00:03:13.349> might<00:03:13.470> end<00:03:13.680> up<00:03:13.739> being

on the team last season Gentry coach
Gentry<00:04:05.189> has<00:04:05.400> been<00:04:05.549> known<00:04:05.790> as<00:04:06.180> somewhat<00:04:07.019> of<00:04:07.019> a

00:04:07.160 --> 00:04:07.170 
Gentry has been known as somewhat of a

00:04:07.170 --> 00:04:08.750 
Gentry has been known as somewhat of a
slow<00:04:07.349> starter<00:04:07.799> it<00:04:07.920> takes<00:04:08.099> them<00:04:08.220> a<00:04:08.250> little<00:04:08.459> bit

00:04:08.750 --> 00:04:08.760 
slow starter it takes them a little bit

00:04:08.760 --> 00:04:12.289 
slow starter it takes them a little bit
to<00:04:09.030> get<00:04:09.480> his<00:04:09.629> rotations<00:04:10.230> fine-tuned<00:04:10.860> and<00:04:11.299> that

00:04:12.289 --> 00:04:12.299 
to get his rotations fine-tuned and that

00:04:12.299 --> 00:04:14.660 
to get his rotations fine-tuned and that
might<00:04:12.450> be<00:04:12.569> exacerbated<00:04:13.379> by<00:04:13.530> the<00:04:13.560> tumult<00:04:14.519> and

00:04:14.660 --> 00:04:14.670 
might be exacerbated by the tumult and

00:04:14.670 --> 00:04:18.199 
might be exacerbated by the tumult and
if<00:04:15.390> if<00:04:15.840> they<00:04:16.290> get<00:04:16.440> off<00:04:16.560> to<00:04:16.680> a<00:04:16.709> slow<00:04:16.949> start<00:04:17.209> due

00:04:18.199 --> 00:04:18.209 
if if they get off to a slow start due

if if they get off to a slow start due
to<00:04:18.389> those<00:04:18.810> factors<00:04:19.320> then

00:04:20.069 --> 00:04:20.079 
to those factors then

00:04:20.079 --> 00:04:21.210 
to those factors then
they're<00:04:20.500> going<00:04:20.650> to<00:04:20.709> have<00:04:20.829> a<00:04:20.859> hard<00:04:21.069> time

00:04:21.210 --> 00:04:21.220 
they're going to have a hard time

00:04:21.220 --> 00:04:24.719 
they're going to have a hard time

00:04:40.379 --> 00:04:40.389 
that they're going to need to play

00:04:40.389 --> 00:04:43.379

00:04:51.420 --> 00:04:51.430 
rebounds that's what gets you started

00:04:51.430 --> 00:04:53.399

out<00:04:51.639> on<00:04:51.699> the<00:04:51.909> break<00:04:52.120> so<00:04:52.690> those<00:04:52.990> are<00:04:53.020> a<00:04:53.169> couple

00:04:53.399 --> 00:04:53.409 
out on the break so those are a couple

00:04:53.409 --> 00:04:55.170 
out on the break so those are a couple
more<00:04:53.770> areas<00:04:54.159> of<00:04:54.310> concern<00:04:54.430> to<00:04:54.610> watch<00:04:54.909> as<00:04:55.060> the

more areas of concern to watch as the

more areas of concern to watch as the

defensive read and rebounding because

00:04:56.740 --> 00:04:58.020 
defensive read and rebounding because
they're<00:04:56.889> going<00:04:57.009> to<00:04:57.069> need<00:04:57.219> those<00:04:57.460> factors<00:04:57.879> to

00:04:58.020 --> 00:04:58.030 
they're going to need those factors to

00:04:58.030 --> 00:05:01.709 
they're going to need those factors to
be<00:04:58.150> strong<00:04:59.129> now<00:05:00.129> if<00:05:00.370> we<00:05:01.210> look<00:05:01.240> at<00:05:01.449> the<00:05:01.539> league

00:05:01.709 --> 00:05:01.719 
be strong now if we look at the league

00:05:01.719 --> 00:05:03.480 
be strong now if we look at the league
in<00:05:01.900> terms<00:05:02.110> of<00:05:02.289> the<00:05:02.469> predictions<00:05:02.889> there<00:05:03.159> it

00:05:03.480 --> 00:05:03.490 
in terms of the predictions there it

00:05:03.490 --> 00:05:06.300 
in terms of the predictions there it
seems<00:05:04.419> that<00:05:04.659> there's<00:05:05.110> a<00:05:05.169> pretty<00:05:05.379> narrow

00:05:06.300 --> 00:05:06.310

00:05:10.090 --> 00:05:11.730 
Pantheon at the top of the NBA I really
have<00:05:10.210> a<00:05:10.240> hard<00:05:10.330> time<00:05:10.599> seeing<00:05:10.870> anybody<00:05:11.199> besides

00:05:11.730 --> 00:05:11.740 
have a hard time seeing anybody besides

00:05:11.740 --> 00:05:14.399 
have a hard time seeing anybody besides
the<00:05:12.039> Lakers<00:05:12.639> the<00:05:12.849> Thunder<00:05:13.210> and<00:05:13.419> the<00:05:13.509> heat<00:05:13.779> that

00:05:14.399 --> 00:05:14.409 
the Lakers the Thunder and the heat that

00:05:14.409 --> 00:05:16.619 
the Lakers the Thunder and the heat that
can<00:05:14.529> legitimately<00:05:15.039> contend<00:05:15.610> for<00:05:15.879> an<00:05:16.360> NBA

00:05:16.619 --> 00:05:16.629 
can legitimately contend for an NBA

00:05:16.629 --> 00:05:19.050 
can legitimately contend for an NBA
title<00:05:16.900> this<00:05:17.199> season<00:05:17.430> so<00:05:18.430> I<00:05:18.460> hope<00:05:18.729> that's<00:05:18.969> not

00:05:19.050 --> 00:05:19.060 
title this season so I hope that's not

00:05:19.060 --> 00:05:20.969 
title this season so I hope that's not
the<00:05:19.180> case<00:05:19.300> and<00:05:19.750> the<00:05:19.870> other<00:05:20.020> 27<00:05:20.409> teams<00:05:20.740> aren't

00:05:20.969 --> 00:05:20.979 
the case and the other 27 teams aren't

00:05:20.979 --> 00:05:22.709 
the case and the other 27 teams aren't
just<00:05:21.129> playing<00:05:21.370> for<00:05:21.610> participation<00:05:22.240> ribbons

00:05:22.709 --> 00:05:22.719 
just playing for participation ribbons

00:05:22.719 --> 00:05:26.490 
just playing for participation ribbons
but<00:05:23.680> I<00:05:24.250> know<00:05:24.669> I'm<00:05:24.969> going<00:05:25.240> to<00:05:25.389> get<00:05:26.110> the<00:05:26.199> chagrin

00:05:26.490 --> 00:05:26.500 
but I know I'm going to get the chagrin

00:05:26.500 --> 00:05:28.800 
but I know I'm going to get the chagrin
of<00:05:26.529> some<00:05:26.800> sons<00:05:27.009> fans<00:05:27.190> with<00:05:27.430> this<00:05:27.580> but<00:05:27.789> i<00:05:28.090> think

00:05:28.800 --> 00:05:28.810 
of some sons fans with this but i think

00:05:28.810 --> 00:05:30.749 
of some sons fans with this but i think
that<00:05:29.050> the<00:05:29.409> lakers<00:05:29.590> will<00:05:29.919> beat<00:05:30.069> the<00:05:30.310> thunder<00:05:30.639> in

00:05:30.749 --> 00:05:30.759 
that the lakers will beat the thunder in

00:05:30.759 --> 00:05:32.550 
that the lakers will beat the thunder in
the<00:05:30.789> western<00:05:31.150> conference<00:05:31.180> finals<00:05:31.629> and<00:05:32.229> I<00:05:32.349> have

00:05:32.550 --> 00:05:32.560 
the western conference finals and I have

00:05:32.560 --> 00:05:34.980 
the western conference finals and I have
the<00:05:32.740> Lakers<00:05:33.099> beating<00:05:33.580> the<00:05:33.759> miami<00:05:34.029> heat<00:05:34.270> in<00:05:34.509> the

00:05:34.980 --> 00:05:34.990 
the Lakers beating the miami heat in the

00:05:34.990 --> 00:05:37.469 
the Lakers beating the miami heat in the
NBA<00:05:35.259> Finals<00:05:35.770> I<00:05:35.949> just<00:05:36.250> think<00:05:36.430> that<00:05:36.520> they're

00:05:37.469 --> 00:05:37.479 
NBA Finals I just think that they're

00:05:37.479 --> 00:05:38.820 
NBA Finals I just think that they're
going<00:05:37.569> to<00:05:37.629> find<00:05:37.839> a<00:05:37.960> way<00:05:38.080> to<00:05:38.139> put<00:05:38.500> that<00:05:38.529> together

00:05:38.820 --> 00:05:38.830 
going to find a way to put that together

00:05:38.830 --> 00:05:41.040 
going to find a way to put that together
the<00:05:39.520> talent<00:05:39.909> they<00:05:40.000> have<00:05:40.029> on<00:05:40.180> the<00:05:40.389> roster<00:05:40.810> I

00:05:41.040 --> 00:05:41.050 
the talent they have on the roster I

00:05:41.050 --> 00:05:42.839 
the talent they have on the roster I
