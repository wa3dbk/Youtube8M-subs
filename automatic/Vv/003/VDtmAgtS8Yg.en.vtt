and just pry the caliper away from the
rotor<00:00:42.899> just<00:00:43.020> a<00:00:43.290> little<00:00:43.500> bit<00:00:44.210> okay<00:00:45.210> there<00:00:45.420> we<00:00:45.570> go

00:00:45.590 --> 00:00:45.600 
rotor just a little bit okay there we go

00:00:45.600 --> 00:00:48.920 
rotor just a little bit okay there we go

secure the caliper there are two
different<00:00:55.770> sizes<00:00:56.010> so<00:00:56.399> I<00:00:56.460> would<00:00:56.699> recommend

00:00:57.229 --> 00:00:57.239 
different sizes so I would recommend

00:00:57.239 --> 00:01:00.799 
different sizes so I would recommend
that<00:00:57.480> you<00:00:58.250> Mach<00:00:59.250> one<00:00:59.820> of<00:00:59.969> them<00:01:00.120> so<00:01:00.390> you<00:01:00.480> get<00:01:00.690> it

00:01:00.799 --> 00:01:00.809 
that you Mach one of them so you get it

00:01:00.809 --> 00:01:03.609 
that you Mach one of them so you get it
into<00:01:01.020> the<00:01:01.379> back<00:01:02.190> into<00:01:02.489> the<00:01:02.550> right<00:01:02.730> position

00:01:03.609 --> 00:01:03.619 
into the back into the right position

00:01:03.619 --> 00:01:07.730 
into the back into the right position
now<00:01:04.619> those<00:01:04.860> bolts<00:01:05.280> are<00:01:05.689> fourteen<00:01:06.740> millimeter

00:01:07.730 --> 00:01:07.740 
now those bolts are fourteen millimeter

00:01:07.740 --> 00:01:10.880 
now those bolts are fourteen millimeter
headed<00:01:08.280> bolts<00:01:08.510> I'm<00:01:09.510> going<00:01:09.689> to<00:01:09.750> be<00:01:09.810> using<00:01:10.260> a<00:01:10.500> six

00:01:10.880 --> 00:01:10.890

the rotor into position we can put the

00:05:17.139 --> 00:05:33.239 
the rotor into position we can put the
mount<00:05:17.439> into<00:05:18.189> place<00:05:24.779> start<00:05:25.779> our<00:05:25.929> bolts<00:05:31.439> now<00:05:32.439> now

00:05:33.239 --> 00:05:33.249 
mount into place start our bolts now now

00:05:33.249 --> 00:05:37.559 
mount into place start our bolts now now
we<00:05:33.309> need<00:05:33.490> to<00:05:33.610> tighten<00:05:33.849> those<00:05:34.059> up<00:05:36.360> next<00:05:37.360> we<00:05:37.449> need

00:05:37.559 --> 00:05:37.569 
we need to tighten those up next we need

we need to tighten those up next we need
to<00:05:37.809> push<00:05:38.199> the<00:05:39.069> piston<00:05:39.399> back<00:05:40.059> in<00:05:40.360> to<00:05:40.929> the

00:05:41.249 --> 00:05:41.259 
to push the piston back in to the

00:05:41.259 --> 00:05:47.459 
to push the piston back in to the
caliper<00:05:44.459> you<00:05:45.459> can<00:05:45.639> use<00:05:45.819> a<00:05:45.899> c-clamp<00:05:46.899> for<00:05:47.289> this

00:05:47.459 --> 00:05:47.469 
caliper you can use a c-clamp for this

00:05:47.469 --> 00:06:00.530 
caliper you can use a c-clamp for this
if<00:05:48.459> you<00:05:48.699> don't<00:05:48.879> have<00:05:49.059> one<00:05:49.209> of<00:05:49.329> these<00:05:49.419> tools

00:06:00.540 --> 00:06:05.120 

okay<00:06:01.540> now<00:06:02.400> next<00:06:03.400> I'd<00:06:03.580> like<00:06:03.730> to<00:06:03.850> put<00:06:04.030> a<00:06:04.060> little

00:06:05.120 --> 00:06:05.130 
okay now next I'd like to put a little

00:06:05.130 --> 00:06:12.770 
okay now next I'd like to put a little
brake<00:06:06.130> grease<00:06:06.460> on<00:06:06.730> the<00:06:09.480> contact<00:06:10.920> areas<00:06:11.920> of<00:06:12.280> the

00:06:12.770 --> 00:06:12.780 
brake grease on the contact areas of the

00:06:12.780 --> 00:06:22.020 
brake grease on the contact areas of the
caliper<00:06:16.710> where<00:06:17.710> it<00:06:17.860> meets<00:06:18.070> the<00:06:18.400> pads<00:06:21.030> make

00:06:22.020 --> 00:06:22.030 
caliper where it meets the pads make

00:06:22.030 --> 00:06:25.670 
caliper where it meets the pads make
sure<00:06:22.240> you<00:06:22.480> get<00:06:22.660> the<00:06:22.900> little<00:06:23.860> rubber<00:06:24.160> boots

00:06:25.670 --> 00:06:25.680 
sure you get the little rubber boots

00:06:25.680 --> 00:06:32.760 
sure you get the little rubber boots
underneath<00:06:27.840> the<00:06:28.840> caliper<00:06:31.350> now<00:06:32.350> don't<00:06:32.620> forget

00:06:32.760 --> 00:06:32.770 
underneath the caliper now don't forget

00:06:32.770 --> 00:06:49.399 
underneath the caliper now don't forget
to<00:06:34.740> grease<00:06:35.740> your<00:06:37.020> pins<00:06:38.020> also

00:06:49.399 --> 00:06:49.409 

00:06:49.409 --> 00:06:58.399 

remember<00:06:50.409> these<00:06:50.590> are<00:06:50.889> different<00:06:52.590> the<00:06:54.810> top<00:06:57.330> is

00:06:58.399 --> 00:06:58.409 
remember these are different the top is

00:06:58.409 --> 00:07:03.300 
remember these are different the top is
different<00:06:59.729> than<00:07:00.729> the<00:07:00.879> bottom<00:07:02.069> there<00:07:03.069> we<00:07:03.189> go

00:07:03.300 --> 00:07:03.310 
different than the bottom there we go

00:07:03.310 --> 00:07:07.020 
different than the bottom there we go
now<00:07:04.240> we<00:07:04.300> need<00:07:04.479> to<00:07:04.569> tighten<00:07:04.840> those<00:07:05.020> up<00:07:05.080> now<00:07:06.030> okay

00:07:07.020 --> 00:07:07.030 
now we need to tighten those up now okay

00:07:07.030 --> 00:07:08.939 
now we need to tighten those up now okay
