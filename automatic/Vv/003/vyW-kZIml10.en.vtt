00:00:27.710 --> 00:00:27.720 
difficult I find it difficult but it was

00:00:27.720 --> 00:00:30.919 
difficult I find it difficult but it was
very<00:00:27.750> worrying<00:00:28.470> because<00:00:28.830> they<00:00:29.670> they<00:00:30.480> loved<00:00:30.779> it

00:00:30.919 --> 00:00:30.929 
very worrying because they they loved it

00:00:30.929 --> 00:00:33.110 
very worrying because they they loved it
in<00:00:31.050> their<00:00:31.260> enthusiasm<00:00:31.830> doesn't<00:00:32.430> mean<00:00:32.640> this

00:00:33.110 --> 00:00:33.120 
in their enthusiasm doesn't mean this

00:00:33.120 --> 00:00:35.840 
in their enthusiasm doesn't mean this
becomes<00:00:33.989> more<00:00:34.320> the<00:00:34.920> mint<00:00:35.100> holes<00:00:35.340> are<00:00:35.610> really

00:00:35.840 --> 00:00:35.850 
becomes more the mint holes are really

00:00:35.850 --> 00:00:38.209 
becomes more the mint holes are really
important<00:00:36.270> part<00:00:36.420> of<00:00:36.600> our<00:00:36.719> school<00:00:37.110> we<00:00:37.649> really

00:00:38.209 --> 00:00:38.219 
important part of our school we really

00:00:38.219 --> 00:00:41.090 
important part of our school we really
value<00:00:38.460> them<00:00:38.940> and<00:00:39.210> we<00:00:39.809> try<00:00:40.170> our<00:00:40.200> best<00:00:40.379> to<00:00:40.860> honor

00:00:41.090 --> 00:00:41.100 
value them and we try our best to honor

00:00:41.100 --> 00:00:44.330 
value them and we try our best to honor
them<00:00:41.370> in<00:00:41.640> so<00:00:42.090> many<00:00:42.239> ways<00:00:42.680> they're<00:00:43.680> people<00:00:44.129> who

00:00:44.330 --> 00:00:44.340 
them in so many ways they're people who

00:00:44.340 --> 00:00:45.920 
them in so many ways they're people who
really<00:00:44.730> give<00:00:44.969> up<00:00:45.090> their<00:00:45.329> time<00:00:45.360> and<00:00:45.840> they

00:00:45.920 --> 00:00:45.930 
really give up their time and they

00:00:45.930 --> 00:00:49.069 
really give up their time and they
volunteer<00:00:46.410> their<00:00:46.440> time<00:00:46.590> and<00:00:47.360> we<00:00:48.360> see<00:00:48.780> them<00:00:48.989> as

00:00:49.069 --> 00:00:49.079 
volunteer their time and we see them as

00:00:49.079 --> 00:00:51.619 
volunteer their time and we see them as
a<00:00:49.140> really<00:00:49.649> integral<00:00:50.219> part<00:00:50.640> of<00:00:50.910> all<00:00:51.360> the

00:00:51.619 --> 00:00:51.629 
a really integral part of all the

00:00:51.629 --> 00:00:53.150 
a really integral part of all the
learning<00:00:51.930> that<00:00:52.020> takes<00:00:52.230> place<00:00:52.410> in<00:00:52.739> our<00:00:52.829> school

00:00:53.150 --> 00:00:53.160 
learning that takes place in our school

00:00:53.160 --> 00:00:55.310 
learning that takes place in our school
I<00:00:53.340> look<00:00:53.699> forward<00:00:54.180> to<00:00:54.270> my<00:00:54.480> engine<00:00:54.780> classes<00:00:55.170> are

00:00:55.310 --> 00:00:55.320 
I look forward to my engine classes are

00:00:55.320 --> 00:00:56.299 
I look forward to my engine classes are
really

00:00:56.299 --> 00:00:56.309 
really

00:00:56.309 --> 00:01:02.210 
really
because<00:00:57.309> it's<00:00:59.100> something<00:01:00.100> that<00:01:00.399> is<00:01:00.610> more<00:01:01.540> of<00:01:01.690> a

00:01:02.210 --> 00:01:02.220 
because it's something that is more of a

00:01:02.220 --> 00:01:05.460 
because it's something that is more of a
one-on-one<00:01:03.690> experience<00:01:04.690> compared<00:01:05.140> to<00:01:05.350> the

00:01:05.460 --> 00:01:05.470 
one-on-one experience compared to the

00:01:05.470 --> 00:01:07.609 
one-on-one experience compared to the
class<00:01:05.680> it's<00:01:06.400> almost<00:01:06.610> like<00:01:06.850> having<00:01:07.090> a<00:01:07.300> peel

00:01:07.609 --> 00:01:07.619 
class it's almost like having a peel

00:01:07.619 --> 00:01:11.850 
class it's almost like having a peel
except<00:01:08.619> a<00:01:09.000> mentor<00:01:10.000> is<00:01:10.210> perhaps<00:01:11.050> maybe<00:01:11.409> older

00:01:11.850 --> 00:01:11.860 
except a mentor is perhaps maybe older

00:01:11.860 --> 00:01:13.710 
except a mentor is perhaps maybe older
than<00:01:12.010> you<00:01:12.220> shares<00:01:12.729> the<00:01:12.880> same<00:01:13.090> interests<00:01:13.600> as

00:01:13.710 --> 00:01:13.720 
than you shares the same interests as

00:01:13.720 --> 00:01:16.770 
than you shares the same interests as
you<00:01:13.900> and<00:01:14.170> the<00:01:14.470> and<00:01:15.210> it's<00:01:16.210> all<00:01:16.360> about<00:01:16.570> learning

00:01:16.770 --> 00:01:16.780 
you and the and it's all about learning

00:01:16.780 --> 00:01:18.840 
you and the and it's all about learning
together<00:01:17.200> it's<00:01:17.680> not<00:01:17.920> really<00:01:18.160> like<00:01:18.460> having<00:01:18.670> a

00:01:18.840 --> 00:01:18.850 
together it's not really like having a

00:01:18.850 --> 00:01:20.370 
together it's not really like having a
teacher<00:01:19.090> who<00:01:19.330> knows<00:01:19.479> more<00:01:19.780> things<00:01:20.050> than<00:01:20.229> you

00:01:20.370 --> 00:01:20.380 
teacher who knows more things than you

00:01:20.380 --> 00:01:22.590 
teacher who knows more things than you
it's<00:01:20.560> not<00:01:20.740> as<00:01:20.920> intimidating<00:01:21.310> I<00:01:21.970> have<00:01:22.360> been

00:01:22.590 --> 00:01:22.600 
it's not as intimidating I have been

00:01:22.600 --> 00:01:26.550 
it's not as intimidating I have been
inspired<00:01:22.930> because<00:01:23.640> or<00:01:24.640> she<00:01:25.360> um<00:01:25.600> she<00:01:25.960> made<00:01:26.409> it

00:01:26.550 --> 00:01:26.560 
inspired because or she um she made it

00:01:26.560 --> 00:01:28.620 
inspired because or she um she made it
sound<00:01:26.800> interesting<00:01:27.190> at<00:01:27.970> first<00:01:28.240> I<00:01:28.420> wasn't

00:01:28.620 --> 00:01:28.630 
sound interesting at first I wasn't

00:01:28.630 --> 00:01:30.540 
sound interesting at first I wasn't
quite<00:01:29.020> sure<00:01:29.140> whether<00:01:29.649> I<00:01:29.770> wanted<00:01:30.190> to<00:01:30.369> learn

00:01:30.540 --> 00:01:30.550 
quite sure whether I wanted to learn

00:01:30.550 --> 00:01:33.359 
quite sure whether I wanted to learn
with<00:01:31.300> an<00:01:31.450> after<00:01:31.780> mentoring<00:01:32.229> I<00:01:32.619> thought<00:01:33.070> I

00:01:33.359 --> 00:01:33.369 
with an after mentoring I thought I

00:01:33.369 --> 00:01:35.130 
with an after mentoring I thought I
would<00:01:34.060> really<00:01:34.300> like<00:01:34.509> to<00:01:34.750> learn<00:01:34.869> more<00:01:34.930> about

00:01:35.130 --> 00:01:35.140 
would really like to learn more about

00:01:35.140 --> 00:01:38.279 
would really like to learn more about
