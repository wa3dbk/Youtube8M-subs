isn't actually to play my iPhone in it's
to<00:01:22.619> turn<00:01:22.799> this<00:01:23.100> into<00:01:23.400> a<00:01:23.490> standalone<00:01:24.229> mp3

00:01:25.219 --> 00:01:25.229 
to turn this into a standalone mp3

00:01:25.229 --> 00:01:28.700 
to turn this into a standalone mp3
player<00:01:25.560> and<00:01:26.299> Bluetooth<00:01:27.299> receiver<00:01:27.509> so<00:01:28.380> to<00:01:28.439> do

00:01:28.700 --> 00:01:28.710 
player and Bluetooth receiver so to do

00:01:28.710 --> 00:01:31.460 
player and Bluetooth receiver so to do
that<00:01:28.740> I've<00:01:29.159> just<00:01:29.369> purchased<00:01:29.579> this<00:01:30.270> from<00:01:30.600> eBay

00:01:31.460 --> 00:01:31.470 
that I've just purchased this from eBay

00:01:31.470 --> 00:01:38.510 
that I've just purchased this from eBay
it's<00:01:32.189> about<00:01:34.159> 1213<00:01:35.509> Australian<00:01:36.509> dollars<00:01:37.520> will

00:01:38.510 --> 00:01:38.520 
it's about 1213 Australian dollars will

00:01:38.520 --> 00:01:40.039 
it's about 1213 Australian dollars will
probably<00:01:38.790> take<00:01:38.909> a<00:01:38.939> month<00:01:39.270> to<00:01:39.479> get<00:01:39.630> here<00:01:39.840> but

00:01:40.039 --> 00:01:40.049 
probably take a month to get here but

00:01:40.049 --> 00:01:42.499 
probably take a month to get here but
I'm<00:01:40.200> not<00:01:40.229> really<00:01:40.530> in<00:01:40.740> a<00:01:40.799> rush<00:01:41.009> so<00:01:41.970> what<00:01:42.090> this<00:01:42.240> is

00:01:42.499 --> 00:01:42.509 
I'm not really in a rush so what this is

00:01:42.509 --> 00:01:46.700 
I'm not really in a rush so what this is
is<00:01:42.720> a<00:01:43.579> it's<00:01:44.579> a<00:01:44.759> mp3<00:01:45.240> dakota<00:01:45.899> board<00:01:46.229> with

00:01:46.700 --> 00:01:46.710 
is a it's a mp3 dakota board with

00:01:46.710 --> 00:01:51.740 
is a it's a mp3 dakota board with
bluetooth<00:01:47.869> and<00:01:48.869> FM<00:01:49.680> radio<00:01:49.909> so<00:01:50.909> you<00:01:51.390> get<00:01:51.540> the

00:01:51.740 --> 00:01:51.750 
bluetooth and FM radio so you get the

00:01:51.750 --> 00:01:54.319 
bluetooth and FM radio so you get the
front<00:01:51.990> panel<00:01:52.470> here<00:01:52.710> it's<00:01:53.159> about<00:01:53.310> SD<00:01:53.700> card<00:01:54.000> slot

00:01:54.319 --> 00:01:54.329 
front panel here it's about SD card slot

00:01:54.329 --> 00:01:58.880 
front panel here it's about SD card slot
and<00:01:54.680> u.s.<00:01:55.680> people<00:01:55.890> and<00:01:57.560> it's<00:01:58.560> also<00:01:58.680> got<00:01:58.829> a

00:01:58.880 --> 00:01:58.890 
and u.s. people and it's also got a

00:01:58.890 --> 00:02:02.719 
and u.s. people and it's also got a
bluetooth<00:01:59.310> module<00:01:59.520> in<00:01:59.850> it<00:01:59.939> and<00:02:00.530> FM<00:02:01.530> so<00:02:02.219> the

00:02:02.719 --> 00:02:02.729 
bluetooth module in it and FM so the

00:02:02.729 --> 00:02:11.100 
bluetooth module in it and FM so the
idea<00:02:03.060> is<00:02:03.240> to<00:02:03.270> have<00:02:03.659> that<00:02:05.030> mounted<00:02:06.030> in<00:02:06.360> the<00:02:06.600> sub

00:02:11.100 --> 00:02:11.110 

00:02:11.110 --> 00:02:15.610 

about<00:02:12.110> this<00:02:12.580> step<00:02:13.580> it's<00:02:14.270> a<00:02:14.480> sub-sub<00:02:15.410> looks

00:02:15.610 --> 00:02:15.620 
about this step it's a sub-sub looks

00:02:15.620 --> 00:02:17.620 
about this step it's a sub-sub looks
like<00:02:15.770> that<00:02:16.010> I'm<00:02:16.459> thinking<00:02:16.819> of<00:02:17.180> putting<00:02:17.450> it

00:02:17.620 --> 00:02:17.630 
like that I'm thinking of putting it

00:02:17.630 --> 00:02:21.339 
like that I'm thinking of putting it
about<00:02:17.900> here<00:02:18.319> and<00:02:18.620> then<00:02:19.459> that<00:02:20.270> way<00:02:20.540> hopefully

00:02:21.339 --> 00:02:21.349 
about here and then that way hopefully

00:02:21.349 --> 00:02:23.380 
about here and then that way hopefully

00:02:23.380 --> 00:02:23.390 
you just join go up to this unit pop in

00:02:23.390 --> 00:02:25.720 
you just join go up to this unit pop in
a<00:02:23.450> USB<00:02:23.480> stick<00:02:24.140> and<00:02:24.349> hit<00:02:24.860> play<00:02:25.040> on<00:02:25.310> the<00:02:25.400> remote

00:02:25.720 --> 00:02:25.730 
a USB stick and hit play on the remote

00:02:25.730 --> 00:02:27.970 
a USB stick and hit play on the remote
or<00:02:26.030> on<00:02:26.810> the<00:02:26.930> years<00:02:27.110> itself<00:02:27.530> there<00:02:27.709> is<00:02:27.739> a<00:02:27.830> little

00:02:27.970 --> 00:02:27.980 
or on the years itself there is a little

00:02:27.980 --> 00:02:29.740 
or on the years itself there is a little
play<00:02:28.190> button<00:02:28.370> I<00:02:28.580> have<00:02:28.700> a<00:02:28.760> look<00:02:29.000> at<00:02:29.300> quite<00:02:29.600> a<00:02:29.660> few

00:02:29.740 --> 00:02:29.750 
play button I have a look at quite a few

00:02:29.750 --> 00:02:31.960 
play button I have a look at quite a few
of<00:02:30.050> these<00:02:30.200> on<00:02:30.440> eBay<00:02:30.830> this<00:02:31.069> one<00:02:31.280> seems<00:02:31.610> like<00:02:31.850> the

00:02:31.960 --> 00:02:31.970 
of these on eBay this one seems like the

00:02:31.970 --> 00:02:35.979 
of these on eBay this one seems like the
best<00:02:32.680> almost<00:02:33.680> bought<00:02:33.890> one<00:02:33.920> that<00:02:34.250> had<00:02:34.430> a<00:02:34.900> one<00:02:35.900> of

00:02:35.979 --> 00:02:35.989 
best almost bought one that had a one of

00:02:35.989 --> 00:02:38.920 
best almost bought one that had a one of
those<00:02:36.110> like<00:02:36.500> really<00:02:37.310> small<00:02:37.580> SD<00:02:38.420> cards<00:02:38.780> and

00:02:38.920 --> 00:02:38.930 
those like really small SD cards and

00:02:38.930 --> 00:02:40.360 
those like really small SD cards and
micro<00:02:39.200> SD<00:02:39.319> card<00:02:39.680> I<00:02:39.739> think<00:02:39.769> they're<00:02:40.010> cool<00:02:40.190> and

00:02:40.360 --> 00:02:40.370 
micro SD card I think they're cool and

00:02:40.370 --> 00:02:42.550 
micro SD card I think they're cool and
then<00:02:41.150> I<00:02:41.180> found<00:02:41.330> this<00:02:41.450> with<00:02:41.630> a<00:02:41.690> full-size<00:02:42.050> slot

00:02:42.550 --> 00:02:42.560 
then I found this with a full-size slot

00:02:42.560 --> 00:02:46.030 
then I found this with a full-size slot
so<00:02:42.769> I<00:02:42.830> was<00:02:42.920> happy<00:02:43.160> about<00:02:43.190> that<00:02:43.340> um<00:02:44.860> anyway<00:02:45.860> so

00:02:46.030 --> 00:02:46.040 
so I was happy about that um anyway so

00:02:46.040 --> 00:02:48.430 
so I was happy about that um anyway so
I've<00:02:46.730> watched<00:02:46.940> videos<00:02:47.330> about<00:02:47.810> these<00:02:48.170> on

00:02:48.430 --> 00:02:48.440 
I've watched videos about these on

00:02:48.440 --> 00:02:50.140 
I've watched videos about these on
YouTube<00:02:48.830> they<00:02:49.040> actually<00:02:49.310> seem<00:02:49.549> really<00:02:49.970> good

00:02:50.140 --> 00:02:50.150 
YouTube they actually seem really good

00:02:50.150 --> 00:02:52.930 
YouTube they actually seem really good
and<00:02:50.360> me<00:02:50.780> for<00:02:50.930> 10<00:02:51.160> 15<00:02:52.160> bucks<00:02:52.310> or<00:02:52.489> whatever<00:02:52.580> it<00:02:52.819> is

00:02:52.930 --> 00:02:52.940 
and me for 10 15 bucks or whatever it is

00:02:52.940 --> 00:02:55.050 
and me for 10 15 bucks or whatever it is
I<00:02:53.030> don't<00:02:53.090> care<00:02:53.239> it<00:02:53.600> doesn't<00:02:53.630> work<00:02:53.989> that<00:02:54.170> well

00:02:55.050 --> 00:02:55.060 
I don't care it doesn't work that well

00:02:55.060 --> 00:02:59.350 
I don't care it doesn't work that well
and<00:02:56.060> so<00:02:57.100> reason<00:02:58.100> I've<00:02:58.160> had<00:02:58.280> this<00:02:58.519> out<00:02:58.700> here<00:02:59.120> is

00:02:59.350 --> 00:02:59.360 
and so reason I've had this out here is

00:02:59.360 --> 00:03:00.850 
and so reason I've had this out here is
because<00:02:59.390> I've<00:02:59.780> been<00:02:59.810> poking<00:03:00.319> around<00:03:00.410> with<00:03:00.709> my

00:03:00.850 --> 00:03:00.860 
because I've been poking around with my

00:03:00.860 --> 00:03:03.070 
because I've been poking around with my
multimeter<00:03:01.280> to<00:03:01.730> try<00:03:02.239> and<00:03:02.360> work<00:03:02.510> out<00:03:02.690> how<00:03:02.750> I'm

00:03:03.070 --> 00:03:03.080 
multimeter to try and work out how I'm

00:03:03.080 --> 00:03:05.289 
multimeter to try and work out how I'm
going<00:03:03.230> to<00:03:03.319> power<00:03:03.530> this<00:03:03.769> thing<00:03:04.090> I've<00:03:05.090> noticed

00:03:05.289 --> 00:03:05.299 
going to power this thing I've noticed

00:03:05.299 --> 00:03:09.220 
going to power this thing I've noticed
that<00:03:05.720> there's<00:03:06.680> I<00:03:07.580> think<00:03:07.910> it<00:03:07.970> was<00:03:08.060> about<00:03:08.239> 15<00:03:09.200> or

00:03:09.220 --> 00:03:09.230 
that there's I think it was about 15 or

00:03:09.230 --> 00:03:11.890 
that there's I think it was about 15 or
so<00:03:09.590> volts<00:03:10.100> AC<00:03:10.580> coming<00:03:11.540> in<00:03:11.660> from<00:03:11.810> the

00:03:11.890 --> 00:03:11.900 
so volts AC coming in from the

00:03:11.900 --> 00:03:15.670 
so volts AC coming in from the
transformer<00:03:12.590> and<00:03:13.299> if<00:03:14.299> I<00:03:14.450> I<00:03:14.750> test<00:03:15.260> it<00:03:15.380> up<00:03:15.500> here

00:03:15.670 --> 00:03:15.680 
transformer and if I I test it up here

00:03:15.680 --> 00:03:17.830 
transformer and if I I test it up here
at<00:03:15.739> the<00:03:15.829> capacitor<00:03:16.400> with<00:03:16.970> my<00:03:17.090> multimeter<00:03:17.630> and

00:03:17.830 --> 00:03:17.840 
at the capacitor with my multimeter and

00:03:17.840 --> 00:03:21.550 
at the capacitor with my multimeter and
found<00:03:18.109> I'm<00:03:18.290> getting<00:03:18.730> around<00:03:19.730> 18<00:03:20.329> volts<00:03:20.840> DC<00:03:21.230> and

00:03:21.550 --> 00:03:21.560 
found I'm getting around 18 volts DC and

00:03:21.560 --> 00:03:23.890 
found I'm getting around 18 volts DC and
when<00:03:22.370> this<00:03:22.579> whole<00:03:22.790> thing<00:03:23.090> is<00:03:23.209> turned<00:03:23.480> up<00:03:23.690> all

00:03:23.890 --> 00:03:23.900 
when this whole thing is turned up all

00:03:23.900 --> 00:03:26.259 
when this whole thing is turned up all
the<00:03:24.260> way<00:03:24.440> it<00:03:24.709> drops<00:03:24.950> to<00:03:25.100> about<00:03:25.190> 14<00:03:25.880> and<00:03:25.910> a<00:03:26.090> half

00:03:26.259 --> 00:03:26.269 
the way it drops to about 14 and a half

00:03:26.269 --> 00:03:30.220 
the way it drops to about 14 and a half
volts<00:03:27.100> so<00:03:28.100> to<00:03:28.190> drop<00:03:28.459> that<00:03:28.609> down<00:03:28.880> to<00:03:29.180> the<00:03:29.810> 12

00:03:30.220 --> 00:03:30.230 
volts so to drop that down to the 12

00:03:30.230 --> 00:03:31.630 
volts so to drop that down to the 12
volts<00:03:30.470> that<00:03:30.650> this<00:03:30.829> unit<00:03:31.100> needs

00:03:31.630 --> 00:03:31.640 
volts that this unit needs

00:03:31.640 --> 00:03:37.569 
volts that this unit needs
I<00:03:31.670> have<00:03:32.390> also<00:03:32.540> purchased<00:03:32.900> a<00:03:36.579> voltage

00:03:37.569 --> 00:03:37.579 
I have also purchased a voltage

00:03:37.579 --> 00:03:41.349 
I have also purchased a voltage
regulator<00:03:39.190> from<00:03:40.190> what<00:03:40.519> I've<00:03:40.640> read<00:03:40.880> about<00:03:41.030> this

00:03:41.349 --> 00:03:41.359 
regulator from what I've read about this

00:03:41.359 --> 00:03:43.720 
regulator from what I've read about this
one<00:03:41.600> on<00:03:41.750> the<00:03:41.840> internet<00:03:42.230> it's<00:03:42.950> cut<00:03:43.340> off<00:03:43.489> voltage

00:03:43.720 --> 00:03:43.730 
one on the internet it's cut off voltage

00:03:43.730 --> 00:03:47.710 
one on the internet it's cut off voltage
should<00:03:44.150> be<00:03:44.359> 2<00:03:45.140> volts<00:03:45.440> more<00:03:45.799> than<00:03:46.250> I<00:03:46.280> need<00:03:46.760> so<00:03:46.790> 14

00:03:47.710 --> 00:03:47.720 
should be 2 volts more than I need so 14

00:03:47.720 --> 00:03:49.539 
should be 2 volts more than I need so 14
volts<00:03:48.170> so<00:03:48.290> it<00:03:48.320> should<00:03:48.560> be<00:03:48.650> okay<00:03:49.010> even<00:03:49.220> at<00:03:49.310> max

00:03:49.539 --> 00:03:49.549 
volts so it should be okay even at max

00:03:49.549 --> 00:03:51.550 
volts so it should be okay even at max
volume<00:03:49.820> you<00:03:50.000> shouldn't<00:03:50.329> cut<00:03:51.019> out<00:03:51.200> or<00:03:51.350> anything

00:03:51.550 --> 00:03:51.560 
volume you shouldn't cut out or anything

00:03:51.560 --> 00:03:53.680 
volume you shouldn't cut out or anything
now<00:03:52.250> that's<00:03:52.459> a<00:03:52.579> theory<00:03:52.910> anyway<00:03:53.120> I<00:03:53.239> guess<00:03:53.569> we'll

00:03:53.680 --> 00:03:53.690 
now that's a theory anyway I guess we'll

00:03:53.690 --> 00:03:55.509 
now that's a theory anyway I guess we'll
see<00:03:53.870> how<00:03:53.989> that<00:03:54.049> goes

00:03:55.509 --> 00:03:55.519 
see how that goes

00:03:55.519 --> 00:03:57.729 
see how that goes
I've<00:03:56.000> worked<00:03:56.359> out<00:03:56.540> I<00:03:56.569> probably<00:03:56.930> won't<00:03:57.350> need<00:03:57.680> a

00:03:57.729 --> 00:03:57.739 
I've worked out I probably won't need a

00:03:57.739 --> 00:03:59.979 
I've worked out I probably won't need a
heatsink<00:03:58.310> because<00:03:58.609> even<00:03:58.910> when<00:03:59.060> the<00:03:59.090> volume<00:03:59.540> on

00:03:59.979 --> 00:03:59.989 
heatsink because even when the volume on

00:03:59.989 --> 00:04:03.729 
heatsink because even when the volume on
this<00:04:00.319> is<00:04:00.620> down<00:04:00.920> all<00:04:01.130> the<00:04:01.220> way<00:04:02.500> therefore<00:04:03.500> when

00:04:03.729 --> 00:04:03.739 
this is down all the way therefore when

00:04:03.739 --> 00:04:08.289 
this is down all the way therefore when
the<00:04:03.829> voltage<00:04:04.040> is<00:04:04.400> at<00:04:04.549> 18<00:04:05.000> volts<00:04:05.420> here<00:04:05.840> I<00:04:07.299> worked

00:04:08.289 --> 00:04:08.299 
the voltage is at 18 volts here I worked

00:04:08.299 --> 00:04:11.550 
the voltage is at 18 volts here I worked
out<00:04:08.450> with<00:04:08.630> the<00:04:08.660> power<00:04:09.350> drawn<00:04:09.799> by<00:04:10.160> the<00:04:10.389> mp3

00:04:11.550 --> 00:04:11.560 
out with the power drawn by the mp3

00:04:11.560 --> 00:04:15.039 
out with the power drawn by the mp3
Dakota<00:04:12.560> that<00:04:13.340> it<00:04:13.549> should<00:04:13.790> only<00:04:13.880> be<00:04:14.030> about<00:04:14.299> 1.2

00:04:15.039 --> 00:04:15.049 
Dakota that it should only be about 1.2

00:04:15.049 --> 00:04:16.870 
Dakota that it should only be about 1.2
watts<00:04:15.319> of<00:04:15.440> heat<00:04:15.500> generated<00:04:16.070> so<00:04:16.370> I<00:04:16.400> shouldn't

00:04:16.870 --> 00:04:16.880 
watts of heat generated so I shouldn't

00:04:16.880 --> 00:04:18.789 
watts of heat generated so I shouldn't
need<00:04:17.000> a<00:04:17.060> heatsink<00:04:17.479> for<00:04:17.690> this

00:04:18.789 --> 00:04:18.799 
need a heatsink for this

00:04:18.799 --> 00:04:21.460 
need a heatsink for this
let's<00:04:19.160> hope<00:04:19.370> they<00:04:19.549> don't<00:04:19.579> work<00:04:19.819> so<00:04:20.470> that's

00:04:21.460 --> 00:04:21.470 
let's hope they don't work so that's

00:04:21.470 --> 00:04:23.379 
let's hope they don't work so that's
basically<00:04:21.949> my<00:04:22.280> idea<00:04:22.819> at<00:04:22.940> the<00:04:23.000> moment<00:04:23.030> I've

00:04:23.379 --> 00:04:23.389 
basically my idea at the moment I've

00:04:23.389 --> 00:04:24.730 
basically my idea at the moment I've
ordered<00:04:23.629> the<00:04:23.690> parts<00:04:23.900> they'll<00:04:24.199> come<00:04:24.440> in<00:04:24.590> in

00:04:24.730 --> 00:04:24.740 
ordered the parts they'll come in in

00:04:24.740 --> 00:04:27.999 
ordered the parts they'll come in in
probably<00:04:25.129> a<00:04:25.310> month<00:04:25.610> or<00:04:25.759> so<00:04:26.650> yeah<00:04:27.650> so<00:04:27.800> the<00:04:27.889> idea

00:04:27.999 --> 00:04:28.009 
probably a month or so yeah so the idea

00:04:28.009 --> 00:04:29.830 
probably a month or so yeah so the idea
is<00:04:28.250> to<00:04:28.280> have<00:04:28.400> the<00:04:28.520> board<00:04:28.729> in<00:04:29.000> here<00:04:29.240> the<00:04:29.720> other

00:04:29.830 --> 00:04:29.840 
is to have the board in here the other

00:04:29.840 --> 00:04:32.140 
is to have the board in here the other
thing<00:04:29.930> I<00:04:30.229> was<00:04:30.379> thinking<00:04:30.409> is<00:04:30.889> since<00:04:31.190> all<00:04:31.699> of<00:04:31.759> the

00:04:32.140 --> 00:04:32.150 
thing I was thinking is since all of the

00:04:32.150 --> 00:04:33.430 
thing I was thinking is since all of the
other<00:04:32.300> speakers<00:04:32.599> connect

00:04:33.430 --> 00:04:33.440 
other speakers connect

00:04:33.440 --> 00:04:36.249 
other speakers connect
it's<00:04:34.129> just<00:04:34.310> audio<00:04:34.580> out<00:04:34.819> and<00:04:35.030> then<00:04:35.780> the<00:04:35.930> front

00:04:36.249 --> 00:04:36.259 
it's just audio out and then the front

00:04:36.259 --> 00:04:37.899 
it's just audio out and then the front
speaker<00:04:36.889> that<00:04:37.039> had<00:04:37.159> the<00:04:37.250> volume<00:04:37.490> control<00:04:37.759> has

00:04:37.899 --> 00:04:37.909 
speaker that had the volume control has

00:04:37.909 --> 00:04:40.029 
speaker that had the volume control has
a<00:04:37.940> special<00:04:38.330> connector<00:04:38.659> on<00:04:38.780> it<00:04:38.919> and<00:04:39.919> that's

00:04:40.029 --> 00:04:40.039 
a special connector on it and that's

00:04:40.039 --> 00:04:41.920 
a special connector on it and that's
because<00:04:40.190> it's<00:04:40.520> got<00:04:40.699> a<00:04:40.879> circuit<00:04:41.599> board<00:04:41.810> in

00:04:41.920 --> 00:04:41.930 
because it's got a circuit board in

00:04:41.930 --> 00:04:43.960 
because it's got a circuit board in
there<00:04:42.080> I'm<00:04:42.710> thinking<00:04:43.099> I'll<00:04:43.250> put<00:04:43.430> the<00:04:43.550> circuit

00:04:43.960 --> 00:04:43.970 
there I'm thinking I'll put the circuit

00:04:43.970 --> 00:04:47.860 
there I'm thinking I'll put the circuit
board<00:04:44.210> inside<00:04:44.960> the<00:04:45.530> case<00:04:45.740> as<00:04:45.979> well<00:04:46.220> and<00:04:46.870> what

00:04:47.860 --> 00:04:47.870 
board inside the case as well and what

00:04:47.870 --> 00:04:53.020 
board inside the case as well and what
I'll<00:04:47.990> do<00:04:48.139> is<00:04:48.169> since<00:04:48.620> these<00:04:48.830> are<00:04:49.039> the<00:04:51.789> these<00:04:52.789> are

00:04:53.020 --> 00:04:53.030 
I'll do is since these are the these are

00:04:53.030 --> 00:04:56.890 
I'll do is since these are the these are
the<00:04:53.150> pins<00:04:54.080> that<00:04:54.770> this<00:04:55.180> what<00:04:56.180> I<00:04:56.210> might<00:04:56.449> do<00:04:56.659> is

00:04:56.890 --> 00:04:56.900 
the pins that this what I might do is

00:04:56.900 --> 00:04:59.559 
the pins that this what I might do is
just<00:04:56.930> everything<00:04:57.740> that<00:04:57.919> is<00:04:58.460> normally<00:04:59.090> they're

00:04:59.559 --> 00:04:59.569 
just everything that is normally they're

00:04:59.569 --> 00:05:03.730 
just everything that is normally they're
coming<00:04:59.900> from<00:05:00.080> there<00:05:00.289> on<00:05:01.130> D<00:05:01.490> solder<00:05:02.060> and<00:05:02.740> solder

00:05:03.730 --> 00:05:03.740 
coming from there on D solder and solder

00:05:03.740 --> 00:05:06.070 
coming from there on D solder and solder
into<00:05:04.069> the<00:05:04.220> correct<00:05:04.460> positions<00:05:04.909> here<00:05:05.270> so<00:05:05.900> the

00:05:06.070 --> 00:05:06.080 
into the correct positions here so the

00:05:06.080 --> 00:05:07.960 
into the correct positions here so the
board<00:05:06.319> can<00:05:06.440> actually<00:05:06.860> be<00:05:06.979> inside<00:05:07.520> with<00:05:07.729> this

00:05:07.960 --> 00:05:07.970 
board can actually be inside with this

00:05:07.970 --> 00:05:10.350 
board can actually be inside with this
and<00:05:08.300> then<00:05:08.840> I'll<00:05:08.960> just<00:05:09.139> use<00:05:09.319> a<00:05:09.349> really<00:05:09.680> big

00:05:10.350 --> 00:05:10.360 
and then I'll just use a really big

00:05:10.360 --> 00:05:13.779 
and then I'll just use a really big
cable<00:05:11.360> that<00:05:11.479> came<00:05:11.719> with<00:05:11.750> this<00:05:12.110> this<00:05:12.830> one<00:05:13.069> to

00:05:13.779 --> 00:05:13.789 
cable that came with this this one to

00:05:13.789 --> 00:05:16.570 
cable that came with this this one to
only<00:05:13.969> carry<00:05:14.419> just<00:05:14.780> a<00:05:15.050> single<00:05:15.680> make<00:05:16.039> these<00:05:16.280> just

00:05:16.570 --> 00:05:16.580 
only carry just a single make these just

00:05:16.580 --> 00:05:19.450 
only carry just a single make these just
to<00:05:16.729> wise<00:05:16.909> up<00:05:17.150> they<00:05:17.330> just<00:05:17.569> the<00:05:17.949> single<00:05:18.949> channel

00:05:19.450 --> 00:05:19.460 
to wise up they just the single channel

00:05:19.460 --> 00:05:22.209 
to wise up they just the single channel
to<00:05:20.120> that<00:05:20.150> speaker<00:05:20.870> again<00:05:21.259> so<00:05:21.889> then<00:05:22.069> this

00:05:22.209 --> 00:05:22.219 
to that speaker again so then this

00:05:22.219 --> 00:05:25.629 
to that speaker again so then this
speaker<00:05:22.520> should<00:05:22.849> have<00:05:23.229> no<00:05:24.229> volume<00:05:24.620> no<00:05:25.039> power

00:05:25.629 --> 00:05:25.639 
speaker should have no volume no power

00:05:25.639 --> 00:05:29.469 
speaker should have no volume no power
but<00:05:25.940> nothing<00:05:26.479> it'll<00:05:27.139> all<00:05:27.319> be<00:05:27.500> in<00:05:27.560> here<00:05:28.009> and<00:05:28.479> for

00:05:29.469 --> 00:05:29.479 
but nothing it'll all be in here and for

00:05:29.479 --> 00:05:31.120 
but nothing it'll all be in here and for
power<00:05:29.690> I'm<00:05:30.020> thinking<00:05:30.349> of<00:05:30.469> just<00:05:30.620> putting<00:05:30.949> a

00:05:31.120 --> 00:05:31.130 
power I'm thinking of just putting a

00:05:31.130 --> 00:05:33.399 
power I'm thinking of just putting a
switch<00:05:31.699> power<00:05:32.479> switch<00:05:32.750> on<00:05:32.840> the<00:05:32.900> front<00:05:33.139> or

00:05:33.399 --> 00:05:33.409 
switch power switch on the front or

00:05:33.409 --> 00:05:35.469 
switch power switch on the front or
maybe<00:05:33.440> on<00:05:33.770> the<00:05:33.860> back<00:05:33.889> just<00:05:34.639> to<00:05:34.789> cut<00:05:35.029> off<00:05:35.210> the

00:05:35.469 --> 00:05:35.479 
maybe on the back just to cut off the

00:05:35.479 --> 00:05:39.370 
maybe on the back just to cut off the
240<00:05:36.050> AC<00:05:36.490> directly<00:05:37.490> so<00:05:37.880> I'll<00:05:38.779> just<00:05:38.960> put<00:05:39.169> it<00:05:39.259> on

00:05:39.370 --> 00:05:39.380 
240 AC directly so I'll just put it on

00:05:39.380 --> 00:05:42.909 
240 AC directly so I'll just put it on
the<00:05:39.560> brown<00:05:40.400> one<00:05:40.610> the<00:05:40.639> active<00:05:41.029> line<00:05:41.240> and<00:05:42.020> just

00:05:42.909 --> 00:05:42.919 
the brown one the active line and just

00:05:42.919 --> 00:05:45.580 
the brown one the active line and just
give<00:05:43.039> it<00:05:43.069> a<00:05:43.159> power<00:05:43.370> switch<00:05:43.699> and<00:05:44.000> that<00:05:44.419> way<00:05:44.590> turn

00:05:45.580 --> 00:05:45.590 
give it a power switch and that way turn

00:05:45.590 --> 00:05:48.309 
give it a power switch and that way turn
it<00:05:45.740> off<00:05:45.860> it's<00:05:46.190> completely<00:05:46.699> off<00:05:46.900> not<00:05:47.900> using<00:05:47.930> any

00:05:48.309 --> 00:05:48.319 
it off it's completely off not using any

00:05:48.319 --> 00:05:49.689 
it off it's completely off not using any
power<00:05:48.529> turn<00:05:49.219> it<00:05:49.340> on

00:05:49.689 --> 00:05:49.699 
power turn it on

00:05:49.699 --> 00:05:53.320 
power turn it on
amp<00:05:50.419> comes<00:05:50.810> on<00:05:51.050> and<00:05:51.319> the<00:05:51.889> Dakota<00:05:52.610> Borden<00:05:53.090> come

00:05:53.320 --> 00:05:53.330 
amp comes on and the Dakota Borden come

00:05:53.330 --> 00:05:56.800 
amp comes on and the Dakota Borden come
on<00:05:53.740> it<00:05:54.740> would<00:05:54.860> be<00:05:54.919> a<00:05:55.009> sub<00:05:55.310> control<00:05:55.669> still<00:05:56.330> gonna

00:05:56.800 --> 00:05:56.810 
on it would be a sub control still gonna

00:05:56.810 --> 00:06:00.129 
on it would be a sub control still gonna
cut<00:05:56.990> the<00:05:57.110> sub<00:05:57.289> control<00:05:57.680> here<00:05:57.889> and<00:05:58.900> volume<00:05:59.900> and

00:06:00.129 --> 00:06:00.139 
cut the sub control here and volume and

00:06:00.139 --> 00:06:01.990 
cut the sub control here and volume and
then<00:06:00.259> the<00:06:00.620> track<00:06:01.310> and<00:06:01.490> everything<00:06:01.699> will<00:06:01.940> be

00:06:01.990 --> 00:06:02.000 
then the track and everything will be

00:06:02.000 --> 00:06:04.839 
then the track and everything will be
controlled<00:06:02.449> by<00:06:02.690> this<00:06:03.590> unit<00:06:03.949> there's<00:06:04.279> a<00:06:04.430> volume

00:06:04.839 --> 00:06:04.849 
controlled by this unit there's a volume

00:06:04.849 --> 00:06:08.320 
controlled by this unit there's a volume
using<00:06:05.150> the<00:06:05.300> remote<00:06:05.630> and<00:06:06.729> apparently<00:06:07.729> with<00:06:08.300> the

00:06:08.320 --> 00:06:08.330

skip button
I<00:06:09.590> don't<00:06:10.550> know<00:06:10.639> how<00:06:11.000> hard<00:06:11.360> it's<00:06:11.599> going<00:06:11.779> to<00:06:11.900> be

00:06:12.010 --> 00:06:12.020 
I don't know how hard it's going to be

00:06:12.020 --> 00:06:13.629 
I don't know how hard it's going to be
to<00:06:12.080> navigate<00:06:12.560> the<00:06:12.710> menus<00:06:13.039> on<00:06:13.219> this<00:06:13.400> thing

00:06:13.629 --> 00:06:13.639 
to navigate the menus on this thing

00:06:13.639 --> 00:06:15.309 
to navigate the menus on this thing
considering<00:06:14.029> there's<00:06:14.419> four<00:06:14.690> buttons<00:06:15.050> and

00:06:15.309 --> 00:06:15.319 
considering there's four buttons and

00:06:15.319 --> 00:06:17.439 
considering there's four buttons and
about<00:06:15.529> a<00:06:15.560> million<00:06:15.830> functions<00:06:16.430> but<00:06:17.210> I<00:06:17.300> guess

00:06:17.439 --> 00:06:17.449 
about a million functions but I guess

00:06:17.449 --> 00:06:19.659 
about a million functions but I guess
we'll<00:06:17.630> see<00:06:17.659> but<00:06:18.500> in<00:06:18.919> theory<00:06:19.130> this<00:06:19.400> shouldn't

00:06:19.659 --> 00:06:19.669 
we'll see but in theory this shouldn't

00:06:19.669 --> 00:06:22.059 
we'll see but in theory this shouldn't
be<00:06:19.759> too<00:06:19.849> hard<00:06:20.360> and<00:06:20.620> should<00:06:21.620> be<00:06:21.710> relatively

00:06:22.059 --> 00:06:22.069 
be too hard and should be relatively

00:06:22.069 --> 00:06:25.149 
be too hard and should be relatively
cheap<00:06:22.389> so<00:06:23.389> he's<00:06:23.870> hoping<00:06:24.139> it<00:06:24.289> all<00:06:24.409> goes<00:06:24.620> well<00:06:24.860> I

00:06:25.149 --> 00:06:25.159 
cheap so he's hoping it all goes well I

00:06:25.159 --> 00:06:27.490 
cheap so he's hoping it all goes well I
guess<00:06:25.940> in<00:06:26.389> a<00:06:26.449> month<00:06:26.719> or<00:06:26.899> so<00:06:27.050> and<00:06:27.199> the<00:06:27.289> stuff

00:06:27.490 --> 00:06:27.500 
guess in a month or so and the stuff

00:06:27.500 --> 00:06:29.260 
guess in a month or so and the stuff
comes<00:06:27.740> in<00:06:27.919> I'll<00:06:28.009> be<00:06:28.130> making<00:06:28.460> another<00:06:28.699> video<00:06:28.880> of

00:06:29.260 --> 00:06:29.270 
comes in I'll be making another video of

00:06:29.270 --> 00:06:32.560 
comes in I'll be making another video of
the<00:06:29.419> testing<00:06:30.259> out<00:06:30.409> this<00:06:30.680> and<00:06:30.979> then<00:06:31.699> eventually

00:06:32.560 --> 00:06:32.570 
the testing out this and then eventually

00:06:32.570 --> 00:06:35.800 
the testing out this and then eventually
putting<00:06:32.990> it<00:06:33.110> all<00:06:33.199> together<00:06:33.399> so<00:06:34.810> yeah

00:06:35.800 --> 00:06:35.810 
putting it all together so yeah

00:06:35.810 --> 00:06:40.000 
putting it all together so yeah
hopefully<00:06:36.080> that<00:06:36.380> works<00:06:36.500> out<00:06:36.820> see<00:06:37.820> ya
