00:01:43.920 --> 00:01:46.880 
thing over so you will just continue to
do<00:01:44.220> this<00:01:44.400> until<00:01:45.270> you<00:01:45.330> run<00:01:45.540> out<00:01:45.600> of<00:01:45.690> hair<00:01:46.020> now

00:01:46.880 --> 00:01:46.890

like<00:01:47.130> any<00:01:47.400> other<00:01:47.640> right<00:01:48.180> you<00:01:48.570> know<00:01:48.690> fishtail

00:01:49.250 --> 00:01:49.260 
like any other right you know fishtail

00:01:49.260 --> 00:01:52.010 
like any other right you know fishtail
the<00:01:50.220> more<00:01:50.670> hair<00:01:50.940> you<00:01:50.970> take<00:01:51.330> the<00:01:51.660> bigger<00:01:51.840> the

00:01:52.010 --> 00:01:52.020 
the more hair you take the bigger the

00:01:52.020 --> 00:01:54.980 
the more hair you take the bigger the
chunks<00:01:52.440> the<00:01:52.620> less<00:01:52.860> it<00:01:53.070> looks<00:01:53.280> fishtail<00:01:54.210> II<00:01:54.240> the

00:01:54.980 --> 00:01:54.990 
chunks the less it looks fishtail II the

00:01:54.990 --> 00:01:57.620 
chunks the less it looks fishtail II the
more<00:01:55.200> it<00:01:55.290> looks<00:01:55.320> like<00:01:55.620> a<00:01:55.650> French<00:01:55.950> braid<00:01:56.210> so<00:01:57.210> the

00:01:57.620 --> 00:01:57.630 
more it looks like a French braid so the

00:01:57.630 --> 00:01:59.980 
more it looks like a French braid so the
smaller<00:01:57.900> the<00:01:58.050> chunks<00:01:58.560> the<00:01:58.710> better<00:01:58.890> I'm<00:01:59.460> doing

00:01:59.980 --> 00:01:59.990 
smaller the chunks the better I'm doing

00:01:59.990 --> 00:02:04.580 
smaller the chunks the better I'm doing
medium<00:02:00.990> chunks<00:02:01.440> just<00:02:01.500> because<00:02:02.040> I<00:02:03.320> am<00:02:04.320> I'm

00:02:04.580 --> 00:02:04.590 
medium chunks just because I am I'm

00:02:04.590 --> 00:02:06.110 
medium chunks just because I am I'm
trying<00:02:04.920> to<00:02:05.070> keep<00:02:05.250> this<00:02:05.370> video<00:02:05.670> from<00:02:05.850> being

00:02:06.110 --> 00:02:06.120
