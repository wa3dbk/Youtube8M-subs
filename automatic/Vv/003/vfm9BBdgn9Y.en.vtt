in and start screwing screwing a knot in
it'll<00:02:24.490> grease<00:02:24.940> it<00:02:25.180> all<00:02:25.330> the<00:02:25.480> way<00:02:25.600> through<00:02:25.960> and

00:02:26.630 --> 00:02:26.640 
it'll grease it all the way through and

00:02:26.640 --> 00:02:29.940 
it'll grease it all the way through and
then<00:02:27.640> for<00:02:27.940> the<00:02:28.030> bottom<00:02:28.570> I'm<00:02:29.530> going<00:02:29.650> to<00:02:29.740> pull

00:02:29.940 --> 00:02:29.950 
then for the bottom I'm going to pull

00:02:29.950 --> 00:02:33.900 
then for the bottom I'm going to pull
the<00:02:30.130> rubber<00:02:30.430> aside<00:02:32.250> I'll<00:02:33.250> pull<00:02:33.550> the<00:02:33.700> rubber

00:02:33.900 --> 00:02:33.910 
the rubber aside I'll pull the rubber

00:02:33.910 --> 00:02:37.580 
the rubber aside I'll pull the rubber
aside<00:02:34.450> to<00:02:34.780> grease<00:02:35.110> it<00:02:35.140> and<00:02:35.620> then<00:02:36.220> bring<00:02:37.090> it<00:02:37.210> in

00:02:37.580 --> 00:02:37.590 
aside to grease it and then bring it in

00:02:37.590 --> 00:02:40.580 
aside to grease it and then bring it in

00:02:44.940 --> 00:02:44.950 
got it all nicely greased up all sides

00:02:44.950 --> 00:02:48.690 
got it all nicely greased up all sides
in<00:02:45.430> here<00:02:46.330> in<00:02:46.540> the<00:02:47.320> bottom<00:02:47.530> and<00:02:48.280> the<00:02:48.670> bottom

here<00:02:49.590> so<00:02:50.590> that's<00:02:50.920> one<00:02:51.250> side<00:02:51.640> I<00:02:52.090> do<00:02:53.010> guide<00:02:54.010> to

00:02:54.030 --> 00:02:54.040 
here so that's one side I do guide to

00:02:54.040 --> 00:02:58.110 
here so that's one side I do guide to
the<00:02:54.220> other<00:02:54.460> side<00:02:54.790> and<00:02:55.860> we'll<00:02:56.860> get<00:02:57.040> to<00:02:57.220> the<00:02:57.370> rear

00:02:58.110 --> 00:02:58.120 
the other side and we'll get to the rear

00:02:58.120 --> 00:03:02.190 
the other side and we'll get to the rear
drums<00:03:00.060> alright<00:03:01.060> guys<00:03:01.270> I'm<00:03:01.570> starting<00:03:01.690> to<00:03:01.990> get

00:03:02.190 --> 00:03:02.200 
drums alright guys I'm starting to get

00:03:02.200 --> 00:03:05.030 
drums alright guys I'm starting to get
pissed<00:03:02.440> off<00:03:02.710> a<00:03:02.770> kile<00:03:03.160> of<00:03:03.340> old<00:03:03.520> mechanic<00:03:04.120> okay

00:03:05.030 --> 00:03:05.040 
pissed off a kile of old mechanic okay

00:03:05.040 --> 00:03:07.590 
pissed off a kile of old mechanic okay
its<00:03:06.040> one<00:03:06.220> thing<00:03:06.670> that<00:03:06.970> when<00:03:07.210> he<00:03:07.330> came<00:03:07.540> back

00:03:07.590 --> 00:03:07.600 
its one thing that when he came back

00:03:07.600 --> 00:03:10.620 
its one thing that when he came back
with<00:03:08.500> the<00:03:08.530> new<00:03:08.830> mortar<00:03:09.310> and<00:03:09.550> transmission<00:03:10.420> I

00:03:10.620 --> 00:03:10.630 
with the new mortar and transmission I

00:03:10.630 --> 00:03:14.790 
with the new mortar and transmission I
found<00:03:11.260> actual<00:03:11.980> bolts<00:03:12.520> missing<00:03:13.090> on<00:03:13.270> the<00:03:13.990> on

00:03:14.790 --> 00:03:14.800 
found actual bolts missing on the on

00:03:14.800 --> 00:03:20.310 
found actual bolts missing on the on
this<00:03:15.490> side<00:03:15.820> axle<00:03:16.660> shaft<00:03:17.020> okay<00:03:18.180> so<00:03:19.180> he<00:03:19.930> took<00:03:20.140> it

00:03:20.310 --> 00:03:20.320 
this side axle shaft okay so he took it

00:03:20.320 --> 00:03:23.460 
this side axle shaft okay so he took it
back<00:03:20.500> had<00:03:20.830> that<00:03:21.070> situation<00:03:21.370> fixed<00:03:22.060> okay<00:03:22.720> but

00:03:23.460 --> 00:03:23.470 
back had that situation fixed okay but

00:03:23.470 --> 00:03:26.790 
back had that situation fixed okay but
another<00:03:24.100> screw-up<00:03:24.550> he<00:03:24.820> did<00:03:25.140> was<00:03:26.140> this<00:03:26.440> flex

00:03:26.790 --> 00:03:26.800 
another screw-up he did was this flex

00:03:26.800 --> 00:03:29.370 
another screw-up he did was this flex
line<00:03:27.100> okay<00:03:27.820> when<00:03:28.510> he<00:03:28.540> had<00:03:28.780> all<00:03:29.020> this<00:03:29.170> apart

00:03:29.370 --> 00:03:29.380 
line okay when he had all this apart

00:03:29.380 --> 00:03:32.580 
line okay when he had all this apart
okay<00:03:30.450> what<00:03:31.450> are<00:03:31.510> you<00:03:31.570> obviously<00:03:31.990> did<00:03:32.230> he<00:03:32.440> has

00:03:32.580 --> 00:03:32.590 
okay what are you obviously did he has

00:03:32.590 --> 00:03:36.150 
okay what are you obviously did he has
he<00:03:32.740> had<00:03:32.860> the<00:03:33.040> caliper<00:03:33.550> off<00:03:33.580> okay<00:03:34.330> and<00:03:34.890> this<00:03:35.890> is

00:03:36.150 --> 00:03:36.160 
he had the caliper off okay and this is

00:03:36.160 --> 00:03:39.230 
he had the caliper off okay and this is
curled<00:03:36.580> back<00:03:36.760> so<00:03:37.600> as<00:03:37.690> you<00:03:37.810> can<00:03:37.960> tell<00:03:38.020> it's

00:03:39.230 --> 00:03:39.240 
curled back so as you can tell it's

00:03:39.240 --> 00:03:42.210 
curled back so as you can tell it's
rubbing<00:03:40.240> okay<00:03:40.960> so<00:03:41.320> eventually<00:03:41.650> that's<00:03:42.040> going

00:03:42.210 --> 00:03:42.220 
rubbing okay so eventually that's going

00:03:42.220 --> 00:03:45.450 
rubbing okay so eventually that's going
to<00:03:42.280> go<00:03:42.370> through<00:03:42.580> all<00:03:42.940> that<00:03:43.000> is<00:03:43.870> is<00:03:44.200> a<00:03:44.860> flip<00:03:45.430> of

00:03:45.450 --> 00:03:45.460 
to go through all that is is a flip of

00:03:45.460 --> 00:03:49.830 
to go through all that is is a flip of
the<00:03:46.110> caliper<00:03:47.110> and<00:03:47.580> the<00:03:48.580> curl<00:03:48.850> will<00:03:49.240> be<00:03:49.360> forward

00:03:49.830 --> 00:03:49.840 
the caliper and the curl will be forward

00:03:49.840 --> 00:03:51.590 
the caliper and the curl will be forward
where<00:03:50.050> it<00:03:50.170> should<00:03:50.380> be<00:03:50.410> and<00:03:50.740> there's<00:03:51.220> no

00:03:51.590 --> 00:03:51.600 
where it should be and there's no

00:03:51.600 --> 00:03:55.530 
where it should be and there's no
there's<00:03:52.600> absolutely<00:03:52.840> no<00:03:53.320> rubbin<00:03:54.180> so<00:03:55.180> it's

00:03:55.530 --> 00:03:55.540 
there's absolutely no rubbin so it's

00:03:55.540 --> 00:03:58.170 
there's absolutely no rubbin so it's
it's<00:03:55.840> the<00:03:56.050> little<00:03:56.260> things<00:03:56.410> you<00:03:56.860> know<00:03:57.180> think

00:03:58.170 --> 00:03:58.180 
it's the little things you know think

00:03:58.180 --> 00:04:01.320 
it's the little things you know think
about<00:03:58.450> it<00:03:59.040> because<00:04:00.040> like<00:04:00.280> this<00:04:00.460> is<00:04:00.520> a<00:04:00.730> brake

00:04:01.320 --> 00:04:01.330 
about it because like this is a brake

00:04:01.330 --> 00:04:03.780 
about it because like this is a brake
failure<00:04:01.360> waiting<00:04:02.350> to<00:04:02.500> happen<00:04:02.950> you<00:04:03.370> know<00:04:03.490> and

00:04:03.780 --> 00:04:03.790

you<00:04:04.650> when<00:04:05.650> you're<00:04:05.800> doing<00:04:06.040> mechanics<00:04:06.640> here<00:04:06.820> and

00:04:07.080 --> 00:04:07.090 
you when you're doing mechanics here and

00:04:07.090 --> 00:04:08.400 
you when you're doing mechanics here and
brakes<00:04:07.480> and<00:04:07.720> stuff<00:04:07.840> like<00:04:08.020> that<00:04:08.080> you're

00:04:08.400 --> 00:04:08.410 
brakes and stuff like that you're

00:04:08.410 --> 00:04:11.130 
brakes and stuff like that you're
putting<00:04:08.590> people's<00:04:09.040> lives<00:04:09.370> at<00:04:09.760> risk<00:04:09.820> okay<00:04:10.600> so

this side now okay guys we got this side
swung<00:04:35.259> out<00:04:35.470> but<00:04:35.770> as<00:04:35.889> you<00:04:36.039> can<00:04:36.159> tell<00:04:36.220> like<00:04:36.909> look

00:04:37.170 --> 00:04:37.180 
swung out but as you can tell like look

00:04:37.180 --> 00:04:40.050 
swung out but as you can tell like look
the<00:04:38.110> crank<00:04:38.500> kink<00:04:39.039> in<00:04:39.190> there<00:04:39.370> that<00:04:39.699> shouldn't

00:04:40.050 --> 00:04:40.060 
the crank kink in there that shouldn't
