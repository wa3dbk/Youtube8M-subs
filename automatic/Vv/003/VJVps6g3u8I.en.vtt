00:00:10.370 --> 00:00:19.189
 8 yeah hey you in this kind of circuit 

00:00:14.820 --> 00:00:19.189
 It is something about this resistance value- 

00:00:19.510 --> 00:00:29.100
 First So I have asked for that the whole of the current here of You're Hiroshi 6 flow Iruma's is the third floor 

00:00:26.740 --> 00:00:29.100
 Because I 

00:00:29.270 --> 00:00:39.240
 It that this from the overall good 3 minutes flowing through the resistor 

00:00:33.360 --> 00:00:42.920
 I think that I current and voltage is the arm 6 ball you can see the resistance Knowing by say 

00:00:39.240 --> 00:00:42.920
 First of all, let's see 

00:00:43.450 --> 00:00:45.810
 resistance 

00:00:46.240 --> 00:00:49.350
 20 It is generous 

00:00:53.110 --> 00:00:56.460
 It is tomorrow before joining 

00:00:58.960 --> 00:01:01.350
 He is 

00:01:01.829 --> 00:01:07.980
 It is something that I pulled Locol from 106 v 

00:01:05.510 --> 00:01:13.170
 100 v think 

00:01:07.980 --> 00:01:16.010
 Is 100 v From here it is so far here that 

00:01:13.170 --> 00:01:16.010
 It is such a thing 

00:01:16.320 --> 00:01:19.280
 Therefore, it is 

00:01:21.390 --> 00:01:23.750
 echo 

00:01:26.250 --> 00:01:29.720
 25 too 

00:01:35.360 --> 00:01:38.560
 It is a current i 

00:01:41.540 --> 00:01:51.110
 I hope is divided by It is 100 v 20 6 Once you buy What if it is love 

00:01:48.180 --> 00:01:51.110
 And rice 

00:01:51.540 --> 00:01:58.710
 This is a flow of children this way, yes 

00:01:55.240 --> 00:02:00.780
 It will if the home is ne Sir scanning of the ion 

00:01:58.710 --> 00:02:04.040
 Yes 

00:02:00.780 --> 00:02:04.040
 It is sound 

00:02:11.890 --> 00:02:14.340
 It is- 

00:02:17.310 --> 00:02:23.220
 The dragon is 

00:02:19.480 --> 00:02:23.220
 It is 6 volts 

00:02:23.980 --> 00:02:32.489
 Japan end you Su Su This is the will was Sarn 

00:02:29.620 --> 00:02:32.489
 So you 

00:02:33.100 --> 00:02:38.130
 you r 

00:02:35.470 --> 00:02:38.130
 Flow 

00:02:40.010 --> 00:02:42.730
 It is a good dragon- 

00:02:46.390 --> 00:02:48.750
 I will say 

00:02:50.180 --> 00:02:55.030
 Mr. Gauche 

00:02:52.460 --> 00:02:59.860
 Nyan 

00:02:55.030 --> 00:03:03.040
 It's a meal that flows here, so that's where the Sir antenna will come from here 

00:02:59.860 --> 00:03:06.180
 Ampere flows like this 

00:03:03.040 --> 00:03:09.060
 Source tar is 

00:03:06.180 --> 00:03:11.250
 It is 6 volts 

00:03:09.060 --> 00:03:14.390
 And ending in e Nyanka 

00:03:11.250 --> 00:03:14.390
 Konan is it early's
