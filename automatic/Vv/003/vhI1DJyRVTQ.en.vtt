00:00:02.869 --> 00:00:02.879 
hi this is Nevada Chris hunting for gold

00:00:02.879 --> 00:00:06.230 
hi this is Nevada Chris hunting for gold
in<00:00:03.120> the<00:00:03.149> Northern<00:00:03.840> Nevada<00:00:04.160> deserts<00:00:05.160> today<00:00:06.060> I'm

00:00:06.230 --> 00:00:06.240 
in the Northern Nevada deserts today I'm

00:00:06.240 --> 00:00:10.070 
in the Northern Nevada deserts today I'm
using<00:00:06.420> a<00:00:06.919> deus<00:00:07.919> ex<00:00:08.099> P<00:00:08.550> metal<00:00:09.540> detector<00:00:09.900> it's

00:00:10.070 --> 00:00:10.080 
using a deus ex P metal detector it's

00:00:10.080 --> 00:00:13.190 
using a deus ex P metal detector it's
totally<00:00:10.530> wireless<00:00:10.950> there's<00:00:11.219> no<00:00:12.049> cable<00:00:13.049> going

00:00:13.190 --> 00:00:13.200 
totally wireless there's no cable going

00:00:13.200 --> 00:00:15.670 
totally wireless there's no cable going
from<00:00:13.320> the<00:00:13.530> coil<00:00:13.799> to<00:00:13.920> the<00:00:14.280> to<00:00:15.000> the<00:00:15.120> detector

00:00:15.670 --> 00:00:15.680 
from the coil to the to the detector

00:00:15.680 --> 00:00:18.769 
from the coil to the to the detector
it's<00:00:16.680> very<00:00:16.890> lightweight<00:00:17.100> and<00:00:17.660> does<00:00:18.660> a<00:00:18.720> pretty

00:00:18.769 --> 00:00:18.779 
it's very lightweight and does a pretty

00:00:18.779 --> 00:00:22.970 
it's very lightweight and does a pretty
good<00:00:18.960> job<00:00:19.080> on<00:00:19.470> hunting<00:00:20.250> Nuggets<00:00:21.800> right<00:00:22.800> now

00:00:22.970 --> 00:00:22.980 
good job on hunting Nuggets right now

00:00:22.980 --> 00:00:24.529 
good job on hunting Nuggets right now
I've<00:00:23.130> got<00:00:23.310> it<00:00:23.340> in<00:00:23.519> the<00:00:23.609> goldfields<00:00:23.850> program

00:00:24.529 --> 00:00:24.539 
I've got it in the goldfields program

00:00:24.539 --> 00:00:29.810 
I've got it in the goldfields program
and<00:00:27.680> they've<00:00:28.680> a<00:00:28.740> ground<00:00:29.010> balance<00:00:29.369> there<00:00:29.670> and

00:00:29.810 --> 00:00:29.820 
and they've a ground balance there and

00:00:29.820 --> 00:00:52.520 
and they've a ground balance there and
then<00:00:30.380> get<00:00:31.380> the<00:00:31.470> camel<00:00:31.800> over<00:00:51.140> well<00:00:52.140> target

00:00:52.520 --> 00:00:52.530 
then get the camel over well target

00:00:52.530 --> 00:00:56.330 
then get the camel over well target
there<00:00:52.710> and<00:00:54.559> let's<00:00:55.559> dig<00:00:55.710> this<00:00:55.829> up<00:00:55.980> and<00:00:56.160> see<00:00:56.309> what

00:00:56.330 --> 00:00:56.340 
there and let's dig this up and see what

00:00:56.340 --> 00:01:23.380 
there and let's dig this up and see what
it<00:00:56.520> is<00:01:08.090> let's<00:01:09.090> pay<00:01:09.240> up<00:01:09.299> off<00:01:09.450> about<00:01:09.689> an<00:01:09.840> inch

00:01:23.380 --> 00:01:23.390 

00:01:23.390 --> 00:01:28.580 

okay<00:01:24.390> let's<00:01:24.689> try<00:01:24.840> it<00:01:24.930> in<00:01:26.479> I<00:01:27.479> don't<00:01:28.290> know<00:01:28.439> if<00:01:28.530> you

00:01:28.580 --> 00:01:28.590 
okay let's try it in I don't know if you

00:01:28.590 --> 00:01:30.440 
okay let's try it in I don't know if you
can<00:01:28.710> see<00:01:29.009> the<00:01:29.159> screen<00:01:29.549> actually<00:01:29.790> but<00:01:30.270> I'm

00:01:30.440 --> 00:01:30.450 
can see the screen actually but I'm

00:01:30.450 --> 00:01:38.090 
can see the screen actually but I'm
gonna<00:01:30.570> go<00:01:30.750> back<00:01:30.780> to<00:01:33.890> its<00:01:34.890> relic<00:01:35.280> mode<00:01:37.100> and

00:01:38.090 --> 00:01:38.100 
gonna go back to its relic mode and

00:01:38.100 --> 00:01:39.859 
gonna go back to its relic mode and
we're<00:01:38.400> not<00:01:38.549> getting<00:01:38.880> nothing<00:01:39.150> in<00:01:39.420> the<00:01:39.570> relic

00:01:39.859 --> 00:01:39.869 
we're not getting nothing in the relic

00:01:39.869 --> 00:01:42.109 
we're not getting nothing in the relic
mode<00:01:40.079> so<00:01:40.290> that<00:01:40.320> must<00:01:40.590> be<00:01:40.680> a<00:01:40.799> little<00:01:41.729> little

00:01:42.109 --> 00:01:42.119 
mode so that must be a little little

00:01:42.119 --> 00:01:55.679 
mode so that must be a little little
piece<00:01:45.829> scrolling<00:01:46.829> through<00:01:46.979> the<00:01:47.130> programs

00:01:55.679 --> 00:01:55.689 

00:01:55.689 --> 00:02:13.110 

and<00:01:56.409> we're<00:01:56.560> down<00:01:56.740> about<00:01:56.890> two<00:01:57.219> inches<00:02:12.060> that's<00:02:13.060> a

00:02:13.110 --> 00:02:13.120 
and we're down about two inches that's a

00:02:13.120 --> 00:02:16.850 
and we're down about two inches that's a
VLF<00:02:13.510> machine<00:02:13.900> that<00:02:14.790> you<00:02:15.790> have<00:02:15.849> a<00:02:15.970> choice<00:02:16.209> of

00:02:16.850 --> 00:02:16.860 
VLF machine that you have a choice of

00:02:16.860 --> 00:02:19.800 
VLF machine that you have a choice of
four<00:02:17.860> operating<00:02:18.310> frequencies<00:02:18.940> I<00:02:19.180> think<00:02:19.690> I'm

00:02:19.800 --> 00:02:19.810 
four operating frequencies I think I'm

00:02:19.810 --> 00:02:27.180 
four operating frequencies I think I'm
in<00:02:19.959> the<00:02:20.110> the<00:02:20.530> highest<00:02:20.709> one<00:02:21.040> I<00:02:26.040> figure<00:02:27.040> out<00:02:27.099> what

00:02:27.180 --> 00:02:27.190 
in the the highest one I figure out what

00:02:27.190 --> 00:02:28.470 
in the the highest one I figure out what
the<00:02:27.280> number<00:02:27.519> actually<00:02:27.670> is<00:02:27.910> but<00:02:28.180> I<00:02:28.239> think<00:02:28.269> it's

00:02:28.470 --> 00:02:28.480 
the number actually is but I think it's

00:02:28.480 --> 00:02:30.080 
the number actually is but I think it's
somewhere<00:02:28.660> around<00:02:28.780> 17<00:02:29.379> kilohertz

00:02:30.080 --> 00:02:30.090 
somewhere around 17 kilohertz

00:02:30.090 --> 00:02:37.940 
somewhere around 17 kilohertz
I'm<00:02:31.090> just<00:02:31.299> similar<00:02:31.510> to<00:02:31.660> the<00:02:31.870> Gold<00:02:32.049> Bug<00:02:32.230> Pro

00:02:37.940 --> 00:02:37.950 

00:02:37.950 --> 00:02:41.490 

getting<00:02:38.950> a<00:02:39.010> little<00:02:39.099> closer<00:02:39.400> to<00:02:39.670> this<00:02:40.500> let's

00:02:41.490 --> 00:02:41.500 
getting a little closer to this let's

00:02:41.500 --> 00:03:02.440 
getting a little closer to this let's
target<00:02:41.739> that<00:02:42.459> down<00:02:42.670> about<00:02:42.819> four<00:02:43.180> inches<00:02:43.420> now

00:03:02.440 --> 00:03:02.450 

00:03:02.450 --> 00:03:31.970 

must<00:03:03.450> be<00:03:03.600> out<00:03:03.720> of<00:03:03.750> the<00:03:03.870> hole<00:03:30.590> so<00:03:31.590> I<00:03:31.620> think<00:03:31.860> it's

00:03:31.970 --> 00:03:31.980 
must be out of the hole so I think it's

00:03:31.980 --> 00:03:47.450 
must be out of the hole so I think it's
right<00:03:32.130> about<00:03:32.280> there<00:03:40.760> little<00:03:41.760> scoop<00:03:46.280> okay<00:03:47.280> I

00:03:47.450 --> 00:03:47.460 
right about there little scoop okay I

00:03:47.460 --> 00:03:50.680 
right about there little scoop okay I
got<00:03:47.640> it<00:03:47.670> in<00:03:47.850> the<00:03:47.910> scoop<00:03:48.180> and<00:03:48.690> now<00:03:48.900> I'm<00:03:49.050> a

00:03:50.680 --> 00:03:50.690 
got it in the scoop and now I'm a

00:03:50.690 --> 00:04:02.990 
got it in the scoop and now I'm a
one-handed<00:03:51.690> operator<00:03:52.680> here<00:03:54.350> so<00:04:01.760> really<00:04:02.760> have

00:04:02.990 --> 00:04:03.000 
one-handed operator here so really have

00:04:03.000 --> 00:04:07.040 
one-handed operator here so really have
anything<00:04:03.209> except<00:04:03.630> the<00:04:05.209> the<00:04:06.209> camera<00:04:06.570> on<00:04:06.660> let's

00:04:07.040 --> 00:04:07.050 
anything except the the camera on let's

00:04:07.050 --> 00:04:17.349 
anything except the the camera on let's
try<00:04:07.290> this

00:04:17.349 --> 00:04:17.359 

00:04:17.359 --> 00:04:25.190 

and<00:04:18.359> the<00:04:18.450> scoop<00:04:21.980> well<00:04:22.980> MC<00:04:23.870> I'll<00:04:24.870> just<00:04:24.990> dump

00:04:25.190 --> 00:04:25.200 
and the scoop well MC I'll just dump

00:04:25.200 --> 00:04:39.640 
and the scoop well MC I'll just dump
half<00:04:28.820> keep<00:04:29.820> shaking<00:04:30.240> it<00:04:30.300> down<00:04:30.540> and<00:04:35.150> lost<00:04:36.150> it

00:04:39.640 --> 00:04:39.650 

00:04:39.650 --> 00:05:12.260 

lost<00:04:40.650> it<00:04:43.610> lost<00:04:44.610> it<00:05:10.880> that's<00:05:11.880> a<00:05:11.970> nice<00:05:12.120> little
