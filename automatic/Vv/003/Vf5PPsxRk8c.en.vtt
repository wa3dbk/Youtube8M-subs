00:04:30.600 --> 00:04:30.610 
back in the cover three do some regular

00:04:30.610 --> 00:04:32.879 
back in the cover three do some regular
place<00:04:30.970> because<00:04:31.720> the<00:04:31.840> defensive<00:04:32.380> awareness

00:04:32.879 --> 00:04:32.889 
place because the defensive awareness

00:04:32.889 --> 00:04:34.170 
place because the defensive awareness
that<00:04:33.010> the<00:04:33.160> team<00:04:33.340> has<00:04:33.520> is<00:04:33.669> absolutely

00:04:34.170 --> 00:04:34.180 
that the team has is absolutely

00:04:34.180 --> 00:04:36.990 
that the team has is absolutely
incredible<00:04:34.389> so<00:04:34.840> I'm<00:04:35.229> not<00:04:35.350> expecting<00:04:36.220> to<00:04:36.850> give

00:04:36.990 --> 00:04:37.000 
incredible so I'm not expecting to give

incredible so I'm not expecting to give
up<00:04:37.150> too<00:04:37.360> many<00:04:37.540> big<00:04:37.780> plays<00:04:37.990> with<00:04:38.139> this<00:04:38.260> defense

00:04:38.779 --> 00:04:38.789 
up too many big plays with this defense

00:04:38.789 --> 00:04:41.159 
up too many big plays with this defense
right<00:04:39.789> there<00:04:39.850> everything's<00:04:40.300> locked<00:04:40.449> up<00:04:40.690> on<00:04:41.110> a

00:04:41.159 --> 00:04:41.169 
right there everything's locked up on a

00:04:41.169 --> 00:04:42.840 
right there everything's locked up on a
simple<00:04:41.590> cover<00:04:41.770> three<00:04:42.070> and<00:04:42.400> we<00:04:42.550> end<00:04:42.669> up<00:04:42.729> getting

00:04:42.840 --> 00:04:42.850 
simple cover three and we end up getting

00:04:42.850 --> 00:04:45.960 
simple cover three and we end up getting
a<00:04:43.000> sack<00:04:43.710> second<00:04:44.710> and<00:04:44.800> along<00:04:45.010> then<00:04:45.610> right<00:04:45.789> back

00:04:45.960 --> 00:04:45.970 
a sack second and along then right back

00:04:45.970 --> 00:04:47.969 
a sack second and along then right back
so<00:04:46.120> he<00:04:46.180> goes<00:04:46.270> over<00:04:46.600> the<00:04:46.690> middle<00:04:46.720> wide<00:04:47.410> open<00:04:47.860> but

00:04:47.969 --> 00:04:47.979 
so he goes over the middle wide open but

00:04:47.979 --> 00:04:50.340 
so he goes over the middle wide open but
he's<00:04:48.100> overthrown<00:04:49.020> thankfully<00:04:50.020> that<00:04:50.229> would

00:04:50.340 --> 00:04:50.350 
he's overthrown thankfully that would

00:04:50.350 --> 00:04:51.960 
he's overthrown thankfully that would
have<00:04:50.440> been<00:04:50.590> an<00:04:50.800> easy<00:04:50.979> touchdown<00:04:51.370> right<00:04:51.789> here

far<00:06:22.139> so<00:06:22.380> good<00:06:22.410> and<00:06:22.860> that's<00:06:22.979> without<00:06:23.100> having<00:06:23.550> a

00:06:23.629 --> 00:06:23.639 
far so good and that's without having a

00:06:23.639 --> 00:06:25.969 
far so good and that's without having a
scheme<00:06:23.970> that's<00:06:24.600> just<00:06:24.840> due<00:06:24.960> to<00:06:24.990> my<00:06:25.199> my<00:06:25.590> football

00:06:25.969 --> 00:06:25.979 
scheme that's just due to my my football

00:06:25.979 --> 00:06:29.270 
scheme that's just due to my my football
knowledge<00:06:26.430> and<00:06:26.850> my<00:06:27.660> ability<00:06:28.470> to<00:06:28.710> just<00:06:29.040> play

00:06:29.270 --> 00:06:29.280 
knowledge and my ability to just play

00:06:29.280 --> 00:06:30.530 
knowledge and my ability to just play
Madden<00:06:29.520> you<00:06:29.760> know<00:06:29.880> I've<00:06:29.940> been<00:06:29.970> playing<00:06:30.090> Madden

00:06:30.530 --> 00:06:30.540 
Madden you know I've been playing Madden

00:06:30.540 --> 00:06:32.120 
Madden you know I've been playing Madden

00:06:32.120 --> 00:06:32.130 
for years and years and years and years

00:06:32.130 --> 00:06:34.189 
for years and years and years and years
so<00:06:32.310> I<00:06:32.669> pretty<00:06:32.880> much<00:06:32.970> know<00:06:33.240> how<00:06:33.389> the<00:06:33.449> game<00:06:33.660> works

00:06:34.189 --> 00:06:34.199 
so I pretty much know how the game works

00:06:34.199 --> 00:06:37.700 
so I pretty much know how the game works
so<00:06:34.680> me<00:06:35.250> just<00:06:35.639> awful<00:06:36.150> my<00:06:36.590> football<00:06:37.590> skills

00:06:37.700 --> 00:06:37.710

so me just awful my football skills
alone<00:06:38.100> without<00:06:38.280> having<00:06:38.639> a<00:06:38.729> scheme<00:06:39.060> I<00:06:39.330> can

00:06:39.740 --> 00:06:39.750 
alone without having a scheme I can

00:06:39.750 --> 00:06:42.230 
alone without having a scheme I can
probably<00:06:40.020> be<00:06:40.260> a<00:06:40.289> level<00:06:40.620> you<00:06:40.860> know<00:06:41.130> eight<00:06:41.430> but

00:06:42.230 --> 00:06:42.240 
probably be a level you know eight but

00:06:42.240 --> 00:06:43.879 
probably be a level you know eight but
putting<00:06:42.660> together<00:06:42.870> scheme<00:06:43.380> is<00:06:43.530> what<00:06:43.680> I<00:06:43.710> need

00:06:43.879 --> 00:06:43.889 
putting together scheme is what I need

00:06:43.889 --> 00:06:45.740 
putting together scheme is what I need
to<00:06:44.010> do<00:06:44.190> to<00:06:44.669> be<00:06:44.789> able<00:06:44.850> to<00:06:44.940> elevate<00:06:45.120> myself<00:06:45.479> to

00:06:45.740 --> 00:06:45.750

00:06:55.159 --> 00:06:55.169 
you know but I need a scheme to put

00:06:55.169 --> 00:06:56.779 
you know but I need a scheme to put
together<00:06:55.320> and<00:06:56.010> I'm<00:06:56.160> still<00:06:56.340> working<00:06:56.580> on<00:06:56.699> that

00:06:56.779 --> 00:06:56.789 
together and I'm still working on that

00:06:56.789 --> 00:06:58.520 
together and I'm still working on that
you<00:06:56.850> know<00:06:57.030> so<00:06:57.180> far<00:06:57.360> I've<00:06:57.660> tried<00:06:57.930> out<00:06:57.960> for<00:06:58.080> play

00:06:58.520 --> 00:06:58.530 
you know so far I've tried out for play

00:06:58.530 --> 00:07:00.350 
you know so far I've tried out for play
books<00:06:58.770> and<00:06:59.280> I<00:06:59.370> can<00:06:59.550> say<00:06:59.669> the<00:06:59.820> best<00:07:00.000> playbook

00:07:00.350 --> 00:07:00.360 
books and I can say the best playbook

00:07:00.360 --> 00:07:03.080 
books and I can say the best playbook
I've<00:07:00.479> probably<00:07:00.660> used<00:07:00.870> so<00:07:01.199> far<00:07:01.639> would<00:07:02.639> have<00:07:02.850> to

00:07:03.080 --> 00:07:03.090 
I've probably used so far would have to

00:07:03.090 --> 00:07:06.590 
I've probably used so far would have to
be<00:07:03.949> possibly<00:07:04.949> the<00:07:05.130> one<00:07:05.370> the<00:07:06.000> teams<00:07:06.240> that<00:07:06.330> I<00:07:06.479> use

00:07:06.590 --> 00:07:06.600 
be possibly the one the teams that I use

00:07:06.600 --> 00:07:09.050 
be possibly the one the teams that I use
my<00:07:06.900> on<00:07:07.080> on<00:07:07.410> the<00:07:08.010> Xbox<00:07:08.400> I<00:07:08.520> don't<00:07:08.669> know<00:07:08.729> what<00:07:08.940> my

00:07:09.050 --> 00:07:09.060 
my on on the Xbox I don't know what my

00:07:09.060 --> 00:07:10.969 
my on on the Xbox I don't know what my
offensive<00:07:09.389> playbook<00:07:09.630> is<00:07:09.750> but<00:07:09.930> I<00:07:09.990> like<00:07:10.139> that<00:07:10.349> so

00:07:10.969 --> 00:07:10.979 
offensive playbook is but I like that so

00:07:10.979 --> 00:07:14.120 
offensive playbook is but I like that so
far<00:07:11.220> I<00:07:11.430> think<00:07:11.669> that's<00:07:11.820> the<00:07:11.970> best<00:07:12.270> I<00:07:13.169> also<00:07:13.860> want

00:07:14.120 --> 00:07:14.130 
far I think that's the best I also want

00:07:14.130 --> 00:07:16.159 
far I think that's the best I also want
to<00:07:14.190> know<00:07:14.400> what<00:07:15.030> challenges<00:07:15.510> you<00:07:15.570> guys<00:07:15.720> want
