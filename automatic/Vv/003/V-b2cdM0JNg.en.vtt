be Galactus it is the Marvel multiverse
after<00:06:11.300> all<00:06:11.449> so<00:06:11.629> it<00:06:11.749> could<00:06:11.899> be<00:06:11.959> a<00:06:11.989> ton<00:06:12.229> of

00:06:12.249 --> 00:06:12.259 
after all so it could be a ton of

00:06:12.259 --> 00:06:13.629 
after all so it could be a ton of
different<00:06:12.619> villains<00:06:12.919> that<00:06:13.069> they<00:06:13.249> can<00:06:13.459> choose

hope<00:06:30.469> to<00:06:30.709> defeating<00:06:30.979> the<00:06:31.159> syndicate

00:06:31.779 --> 00:06:31.789 
hope to defeating the syndicate

00:06:31.789 --> 00:06:34.809 
hope to defeating the syndicate
so<00:06:32.689> when<00:06:32.809> issue<00:06:32.989> six<00:06:33.379> Sinestro<00:06:34.189> has<00:06:34.429> allied

00:06:34.809 --> 00:06:34.819 
so when issue six Sinestro has allied

00:06:34.819 --> 00:06:37.359 
so when issue six Sinestro has allied
himself<00:06:34.849> with<00:06:35.299> Luthor's<00:06:36.139> cause<00:06:36.499> I<00:06:36.860> find<00:06:37.279> this

00:06:37.359 --> 00:06:37.369 
himself with Luthor's cause I find this

00:06:37.369 --> 00:06:39.069 
himself with Luthor's cause I find this
very<00:06:37.610> odd<00:06:37.789> for<00:06:37.999> two<00:06:38.149> masterminds<00:06:38.779> to<00:06:38.929> work

00:06:39.069 --> 00:06:39.079 
very odd for two masterminds to work

00:06:39.079 --> 00:06:40.629 
very odd for two masterminds to work
together<00:06:39.229> it's<00:06:39.860> like<00:06:40.009> having<00:06:40.219> two<00:06:40.309> alpha<00:06:40.610> dogs

00:06:40.629 --> 00:06:40.639 
together it's like having two alpha dogs

00:06:40.639 --> 00:06:42.939 
together it's like having two alpha dogs
in<00:06:40.939> a<00:06:41.029> pack<00:06:41.239> it<00:06:41.569> shouldn't<00:06:41.899> work<00:06:41.929> one<00:06:42.800> would

00:06:42.939 --> 00:06:42.949 
in a pack it shouldn't work one would

00:06:42.949 --> 00:06:44.649 
in a pack it shouldn't work one would
most<00:06:43.189> definitely<00:06:43.279> betray<00:06:44.149> each<00:06:44.239> other

00:06:44.649 --> 00:06:44.659 
most definitely betray each other

00:06:44.659 --> 00:06:46.329 
most definitely betray each other
Batman<00:06:45.050> is<00:06:45.169> also<00:06:45.469> an<00:06:45.559> alpha<00:06:45.769> dog<00:06:45.889> and<00:06:46.099> as<00:06:46.219> we

00:06:46.329 --> 00:06:46.339 
Batman is also an alpha dog and as we

00:06:46.339 --> 00:06:48.009 
Batman is also an alpha dog and as we
can<00:06:46.459> see<00:06:46.519> Luthor<00:06:47.089> and<00:06:47.119> Batman<00:06:47.509> turns<00:06:47.749> on<00:06:47.929> each

00:06:48.009 --> 00:06:48.019 
can see Luthor and Batman turns on each

00:06:48.019 --> 00:06:48.819 
can see Luthor and Batman turns on each
other<00:06:48.259> at<00:06:48.409> the<00:06:48.499> end

00:06:48.819 --> 00:06:48.829 
other at the end

00:06:48.829 --> 00:06:50.589 
other at the end
I<00:06:48.860> can't<00:06:49.279> imagine<00:06:49.339> Sinestro<00:06:50.089> taking<00:06:50.419> orders

00:06:50.589 --> 00:06:50.599 
I can't imagine Sinestro taking orders

00:06:50.599 --> 00:06:53.139 
I can't imagine Sinestro taking orders
from<00:06:50.779> Luthor<00:06:51.169> for<00:06:51.349> too<00:06:51.499> long<00:06:51.679> so<00:06:52.149> the

00:06:53.139 --> 00:06:53.149 
from Luthor for too long so the

00:06:53.149 --> 00:06:54.969 
from Luthor for too long so the
syndicate<00:06:53.689> has<00:06:53.719> lost<00:06:54.079> powering<00:06:54.619> in<00:06:54.709> the<00:06:54.800> last

00:06:54.969 --> 00:06:54.979 
syndicate has lost powering in the last

00:06:54.979 --> 00:06:57.009 
syndicate has lost powering in the last
issue<00:06:55.129> and<00:06:55.489> now<00:06:55.849> they<00:06:56.029> lost<00:06:56.269> their<00:06:56.509> Alfred<00:06:56.899> in

00:06:57.009 --> 00:06:57.019 
issue and now they lost their Alfred in

00:06:57.019 --> 00:06:59.079 
issue and now they lost their Alfred in
this<00:06:57.169> issue<00:06:57.349> as<00:06:57.769> much<00:06:57.860> as<00:06:58.189> love<00:06:58.369> heroes<00:06:58.759> I<00:06:58.789> love

00:06:59.089 --> 00:07:00.369 
this issue as much as love heroes I love
anti-heroes<00:06:59.719> even<00:07:00.050> more

00:07:00.369 --> 00:07:00.379 
anti-heroes even more

00:07:00.379 --> 00:07:02.199 
anti-heroes even more
I<00:07:00.409> was<00:07:00.739> definitely<00:07:00.949> rooting<00:07:01.519> for<00:07:01.669> matza<00:07:02.059> when

00:07:02.199 --> 00:07:02.209 
I was definitely rooting for matza when

00:07:02.209 --> 00:07:04.209 
I was definitely rooting for matza when
he<00:07:02.269> killed<00:07:02.539> Alfred<00:07:03.079> and<00:07:03.259> how<00:07:03.559> badass<00:07:03.860> was

00:07:04.209 --> 00:07:04.219
