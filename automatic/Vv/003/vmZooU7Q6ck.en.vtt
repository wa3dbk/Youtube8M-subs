00:06:24.850 --> 00:06:24.860 
all means but the best way to do it is

00:06:24.860 --> 00:06:29.560 
all means but the best way to do it is
let<00:06:25.340> the<00:06:25.490> pin<00:06:25.790> sit<00:06:26.690> and<00:06:26.930> drain<00:06:27.470> for<00:06:27.860> a<00:06:28.570> day

00:06:29.560 --> 00:06:29.570 
let the pin sit and drain for a day

00:06:29.570 --> 00:06:31.780 
let the pin sit and drain for a day
maybe<00:06:30.020> two<00:06:30.200> days<00:06:30.560> whatever<00:06:31.010> you<00:06:31.280> got<00:06:31.430> to<00:06:31.460> do<00:06:31.640> to

00:06:31.780 --> 00:06:31.790 
maybe two days whatever you got to do to

00:06:31.790 --> 00:06:33.220 
maybe two days whatever you got to do to
keep<00:06:31.820> it<00:06:32.090> from<00:06:32.270> dripping<00:06:32.510> but<00:06:32.840> if<00:06:32.930> you're<00:06:33.080> in<00:06:33.170> a

00:06:33.220 --> 00:06:33.230 
keep it from dripping but if you're in a

00:06:33.230 --> 00:06:35.560 
keep it from dripping but if you're in a
hurry<00:06:33.470> and<00:06:33.710> you<00:06:34.400> really<00:06:34.670> got<00:06:34.820> to<00:06:34.850> get<00:06:34.970> it<00:06:35.120> done

00:06:35.560 --> 00:06:35.570 
hurry and you really got to get it done

00:06:35.570 --> 00:06:37.960 
hurry and you really got to get it done
then<00:06:35.840> I<00:06:35.870> suggest<00:06:36.230> using<00:06:36.680> my<00:06:36.980> vacuum<00:06:37.220> trick<00:06:37.730> and

00:06:37.960 --> 00:06:37.970 
then I suggest using my vacuum trick and

00:06:37.970 --> 00:06:40.510 
then I suggest using my vacuum trick and
pull<00:06:38.750> a<00:06:38.780> vacuum<00:06:39.020> on<00:06:39.320> the<00:06:39.470> pin<00:06:39.710> just<00:06:40.130> like<00:06:40.220> we

00:06:40.510 --> 00:06:40.520 
pull a vacuum on the pin just like we

00:06:40.520 --> 00:06:43.780 
pull a vacuum on the pin just like we
did<00:06:41.620> put<00:06:42.620> a<00:06:42.650> little<00:06:42.830> bit<00:06:43.040> of<00:06:43.130> that<00:06:43.190> metal<00:06:43.580> tape

00:06:43.780 --> 00:06:43.790 
did put a little bit of that metal tape

00:06:43.790 --> 00:06:46.630 
did put a little bit of that metal tape
over<00:06:44.060> the<00:06:44.330> big<00:06:44.510> leak<00:06:44.750> and<00:06:45.020> then<00:06:45.500> poly<00:06:46.040> sulphide

00:06:46.630 --> 00:06:46.640 
over the big leak and then poly sulphide

00:06:46.640 --> 00:06:47.740 
over the big leak and then poly sulphide
right<00:06:47.120> over<00:06:47.450> it

00:06:47.740 --> 00:06:47.750 
right over it

00:06:47.750 --> 00:06:50.200 
right over it
