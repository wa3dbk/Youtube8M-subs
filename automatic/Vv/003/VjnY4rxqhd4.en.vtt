00:00:18.349 --> 00:00:18.359 
and cabinets accordingly we put two

00:00:18.359 --> 00:00:19.820 
and cabinets accordingly we put two
different<00:00:18.720> types<00:00:18.900> of<00:00:19.050> cabinets<00:00:19.500> in<00:00:19.650> here

00:00:19.820 --> 00:00:19.830 
different types of cabinets in here

00:00:19.830 --> 00:00:21.590 
different types of cabinets in here
there's<00:00:20.160> kind<00:00:20.460> of<00:00:20.490> a<00:00:20.609> more<00:00:20.820> traditional<00:00:21.029> and

00:00:21.590 --> 00:00:21.600

with the clean tone there's essentially

00:00:27.720 --> 00:00:31.339 
with the clean tone there's essentially
three<00:00:28.160> specific<00:00:29.160> tone<00:00:30.150> parameters<00:00:30.750> is<00:00:30.929> clean

00:00:31.339 --> 00:00:31.349 
three specific tone parameters is clean

00:00:31.349 --> 00:00:33.620 
three specific tone parameters is clean
there's<00:00:32.009> what<00:00:32.579> we're<00:00:32.730> calling<00:00:32.850> British<00:00:33.420> which

generally<00:00:41.640> i<00:00:41.670> turn<00:00:41.940> the<00:00:42.090> gain<00:00:42.540> down<00:00:42.570> a<00:00:42.870> little

00:00:43.069 --> 00:00:43.079 
generally i turn the gain down a little

00:00:43.079 --> 00:00:44.209 
generally i turn the gain down a little
bit<00:00:43.200> cuz<00:00:43.379> i<00:00:43.440> just<00:00:43.590> want<00:00:43.800> it<00:00:43.860> to<00:00:43.920> be<00:00:43.980> nice<00:00:44.160> and

00:00:51.470 --> 00:00:51.480 
you notice for set of guitar we're

00:00:51.480 --> 00:00:53.029 
you notice for set of guitar we're
setting<00:00:51.719> clean<00:00:52.020> and<00:00:52.320> now<00:00:52.500> we<00:00:52.559> come<00:00:52.829> down<00:00:52.980> here

00:00:53.029 --> 00:00:53.039 
setting clean and now we come down here

00:00:53.039 --> 00:00:54.619 
setting clean and now we come down here
we<00:00:53.550> have<00:00:53.640> the<00:00:53.760> amp<00:00:53.940> setting<00:00:54.239> you<00:00:54.329> can<00:00:54.390> go<00:00:54.570> over

00:00:54.619 --> 00:00:54.629 
we have the amp setting you can go over

00:00:54.629 --> 00:00:56.450 
we have the amp setting you can go over
to<00:00:54.840> the<00:00:54.930> effects<00:00:55.320> so<00:00:56.070> I'm<00:00:56.160> going<00:00:56.219> to<00:00:56.370> go<00:00:56.430> over

00:00:56.450 --> 00:00:56.460 
to the effects so I'm going to go over

00:00:56.460 --> 00:00:58.819 
to the effects so I'm going to go over
to<00:00:56.699> the<00:00:56.789> effects<00:00:57.180> here<00:00:57.390> and<00:00:57.899> we<00:00:58.140> put<00:00:58.379> a<00:00:58.410> course

00:00:58.819 --> 00:00:58.829 
to the effects here and we put a course

00:00:58.829 --> 00:01:00.529 
to the effects here and we put a course
and<00:00:59.070> a<00:00:59.129> flanger<00:00:59.670> on<00:00:59.820> here<00:01:00.030> we<00:01:00.180> added<00:01:00.510> some

00:01:00.529 --> 00:01:00.539 
and a flanger on here we added some

00:01:00.539 --> 00:01:02.569 
and a flanger on here we added some
reverb<00:01:01.020> and<00:01:01.230> we<00:01:01.350> added<00:01:01.500> gate<00:01:01.890> probably<00:01:02.460> not

00:01:02.569 --> 00:01:02.579 
reverb and we added gate probably not

00:01:02.579 --> 00:01:03.950 
reverb and we added gate probably not
going<00:01:02.670> to<00:01:02.730> use<00:01:02.850> the<00:01:03.000> gate<00:01:03.180> maybe<00:01:03.510> too<00:01:03.780> much

00:01:03.950 --> 00:01:03.960 
going to use the gate maybe too much

00:01:03.960 --> 00:01:05.210 
going to use the gate maybe too much
except<00:01:04.350> when<00:01:04.439> you<00:01:04.530> get<00:01:04.650> into<00:01:04.799> the<00:01:04.949> full-on

00:01:05.210 --> 00:01:05.220 
except when you get into the full-on

00:01:05.220 --> 00:01:07.310 
except when you get into the full-on
distortion<00:01:06.000> stuff<00:01:06.210> so<00:01:06.869> we're<00:01:06.960> going<00:01:07.049> to<00:01:07.140> color

00:01:07.310 --> 00:01:07.320 
distortion stuff so we're going to color

00:01:07.320 --> 00:01:11.520 
distortion stuff so we're going to color
it<00:01:07.470> a<00:01:07.530> little<00:01:07.680> bit<00:01:07.860> by<00:01:08.040> adding<00:01:08.189> a<00:01:08.400> chorus

00:01:11.520 --> 00:01:11.530 

00:01:11.530 --> 00:01:21.460 

add<00:01:12.530> the<00:01:12.710> depth<00:01:12.979> to<00:01:13.219> that

00:01:21.460 --> 00:01:21.470 

00:01:21.470 --> 00:01:30.550 

and<00:01:22.470> we'll<00:01:22.560> add<00:01:22.710> a<00:01:22.740> little<00:01:22.950> mini<00:01:23.160> reverb

00:01:30.550 --> 00:01:30.560 

00:01:30.560 --> 00:01:32.960 

and<00:01:31.560> we<00:01:31.650> can<00:01:31.770> even<00:01:31.890> move<00:01:32.070> over<00:01:32.340> to<00:01:32.460> the<00:01:32.550> flanger

00:01:32.960 --> 00:01:32.970 
and we can even move over to the flanger

00:01:32.970 --> 00:01:35.180 
and we can even move over to the flanger
setting

00:01:35.180 --> 00:01:35.190 
setting

00:01:35.190 --> 00:01:43.680 
setting

we've<00:01:44.690> got<00:01:44.810> some<00:01:44.960> nice<00:01:45.140> nice<00:01:45.560> tones<00:01:45.920> there

00:01:46.210 --> 00:01:46.220 
we've got some nice nice tones there

00:01:46.220 --> 00:01:48.580 
we've got some nice nice tones there
that<00:01:46.370> you<00:01:46.430> can<00:01:46.580> dial<00:01:46.760> up<00:01:46.940> accordingly<00:01:47.450> so<00:01:48.140> from

00:01:48.580 --> 00:01:48.590 
that you can dial up accordingly so from

00:01:48.590 --> 00:01:51.070 
that you can dial up accordingly so from
here<00:01:48.740> I<00:01:48.980> am<00:01:49.250> going<00:01:49.280> to<00:01:49.670> go<00:01:49.850> back<00:01:50.210> to<00:01:50.540> the

00:01:51.070 --> 00:01:51.080 
here I am going to go back to the

00:01:51.080 --> 00:01:53.980 
here I am going to go back to the
actually<00:01:51.740> let<00:01:51.890> me<00:01:51.980> turn<00:01:52.190> these<00:01:52.460> off<00:01:52.750> first<00:01:53.750> of

00:01:53.980 --> 00:01:53.990 
actually let me turn these off first of

00:01:53.990 --> 00:01:55.330 
actually let me turn these off first of
all<00:01:54.140> and<00:01:54.380> I'm<00:01:54.440> going<00:01:54.560> to<00:01:54.590> go<00:01:54.680> back<00:01:54.710> over<00:01:54.890> to<00:01:55.250> the

all and I'm going to go back over to the

00:01:55.340 --> 00:01:59.740 
all and I'm going to go back over to the
amp<00:01:56.320> and<00:01:57.320> we<00:01:58.280> can<00:01:58.430> now<00:01:58.550> go<00:01:58.760> to<00:01:58.820> say<00:01:59.090> let's<00:01:59.570> do

00:01:59.740 --> 00:01:59.750 
amp and we can now go to say let's do

00:01:59.750 --> 00:02:06.540 
amp and we can now go to say let's do
the<00:01:59.900> the<00:02:00.140> British<00:02:00.470> which<00:02:00.680> is<00:02:00.800> kind<00:02:00.980> of<00:02:01.040> a<00:02:01.130> dirty

00:02:06.540 --> 00:02:06.550 

00:02:06.550 --> 00:02:08.670 

add<00:02:07.090> the<00:02:07.240> amount<00:02:07.480> of<00:02:07.570> distortion<00:02:07.900> by<00:02:08.320> the<00:02:08.380> game

00:02:08.670 --> 00:02:08.680 
add the amount of distortion by the game

00:02:08.680 --> 00:02:10.380 
add the amount of distortion by the game
now<00:02:08.830> that's<00:02:09.010> a<00:02:09.130> true<00:02:09.370> game<00:02:09.610> it<00:02:09.880> like<00:02:10.060> this<00:02:10.240> I

00:02:10.380 --> 00:02:10.390 
now that's a true game it like this I

00:02:10.390 --> 00:02:12.960 
now that's a true game it like this I
could<00:02:10.540> be<00:02:10.660> the<00:02:10.780> preamp<00:02:11.200> tube<00:02:12.190> distortion<00:02:12.430> on

00:02:12.960 --> 00:02:12.970 
could be the preamp tube distortion on
