00:00:10.580 --> 00:00:10.590 
another game coming up this weekend how

00:00:10.590 --> 00:00:11.749 
another game coming up this weekend how
has<00:00:10.740> it<00:00:10.769> been<00:00:10.889> for<00:00:11.160> you<00:00:11.190> dealing<00:00:11.550> with<00:00:11.639> that

00:00:11.749 --> 00:00:11.759 
has it been for you dealing with that

00:00:11.759 --> 00:00:14.509 
has it been for you dealing with that
over<00:00:11.940> the<00:00:12.030> last<00:00:12.090> few<00:00:12.300> days<00:00:12.509> well<00:00:13.200> I<00:00:13.980> think<00:00:14.250> it

00:00:14.509 --> 00:00:14.519 
over the last few days well I think it

00:00:14.519 --> 00:00:18.320 
over the last few days well I think it
was<00:00:14.670> just<00:00:15.000> quite<00:00:15.960> special<00:00:16.379> because<00:00:16.500> 80<00:00:17.310> is<00:00:17.430> not

00:00:18.320 --> 00:00:18.330 
was just quite special because 80 is not

00:00:18.330 --> 00:00:20.240 
was just quite special because 80 is not
a<00:00:18.359> result<00:00:18.750> that's<00:00:18.900> going<00:00:19.560> to<00:00:19.619> take<00:00:19.740> every<00:00:20.100> week

00:00:20.240 --> 00:00:20.250 
a result that's going to take every week

00:00:20.250 --> 00:00:23.259 
a result that's going to take every week
but<00:00:20.550> after<00:00:21.510> the<00:00:22.199> game<00:00:22.380> we<00:00:22.470> were<00:00:22.590> satisfied<00:00:22.830> but

00:00:23.259 --> 00:00:23.269 
but after the game we were satisfied but

00:00:23.269 --> 00:00:26.269 
but after the game we were satisfied but
we<00:00:24.269> were<00:00:24.330> thinking<00:00:24.750> solitaire<00:00:25.380> three<00:00:25.949> points

00:00:26.269 --> 00:00:26.279 
we were thinking solitaire three points

00:00:26.279 --> 00:00:29.240 
we were thinking solitaire three points
and<00:00:26.400> next<00:00:26.460> year<00:00:27.449> they<00:00:27.599> will<00:00:27.630> be<00:00:27.980> another<00:00:28.980> big

00:00:29.240 --> 00:00:29.250 
and next year they will be another big

00:00:29.250 --> 00:00:32.179 
and next year they will be another big
match<00:00:29.279> at<00:00:29.580> all<00:00:29.699> and<00:00:30.380> against<00:00:31.380> very<00:00:31.769> difficult

00:00:32.179 --> 00:00:32.189 
match at all and against very difficult

00:00:32.189 --> 00:00:36.520 
match at all and against very difficult
opponent<00:00:32.579> so<00:00:32.759> yeah<00:00:33.750> we<00:00:33.899> uh<00:00:34.250> we<00:00:35.250> were<00:00:35.340> quickly

00:00:36.520 --> 00:00:36.530 
opponent so yeah we uh we were quickly

00:00:36.530 --> 00:00:39.740 
opponent so yeah we uh we were quickly
focus<00:00:37.530> to<00:00:37.800> the<00:00:37.829> next<00:00:38.100> game<00:00:38.219> actually<00:00:38.460> and<00:00:38.790> of

00:00:39.740 --> 00:00:39.750 
focus to the next game actually and of

00:00:39.750 --> 00:00:41.060 
focus to the next game actually and of
course<00:00:39.960> we<00:00:40.079> enjoyed<00:00:40.379> it<00:00:40.500> a<00:00:40.559> little<00:00:40.680> bit<00:00:40.890> but

00:00:41.060 --> 00:00:41.070 
course we enjoyed it a little bit but

00:00:41.070 --> 00:00:44.090 
course we enjoyed it a little bit but
we're<00:00:41.910> not<00:00:42.180> like<00:00:42.390> thinking<00:00:42.750> like<00:00:42.829> 80<00:00:43.829> the

00:00:44.090 --> 00:00:44.100 
we're not like thinking like 80 the

00:00:44.100 --> 00:00:47.029 
we're not like thinking like 80 the
notice<00:00:44.760> was<00:00:45.600> a<00:00:45.690> good<00:00:45.840> winning<00:00:46.079> and<00:00:46.710> that's<00:00:46.920> it

00:00:47.029 --> 00:00:47.039 
notice was a good winning and that's it

00:00:47.039 --> 00:00:48.410 
notice was a good winning and that's it
I<00:00:47.070> think<00:00:47.309> I<00:00:47.520> mean<00:00:47.760> certainly<00:00:47.969> during<00:00:48.270> those

00:00:48.410 --> 00:00:48.420 
I think I mean certainly during those

00:00:48.420 --> 00:00:50.330 
I think I mean certainly during those
first<00:00:48.660> hours<00:00:49.110> and<00:00:49.320> maybe<00:00:49.590> the<00:00:49.770> first<00:00:49.950> 24<00:00:50.309> hours

00:00:50.330 --> 00:00:50.340 
first hours and maybe the first 24 hours

00:00:50.340 --> 00:00:51.680 
first hours and maybe the first 24 hours
or<00:00:50.550> so<00:00:50.700> after<00:00:50.940> the<00:00:50.969> result<00:00:51.270> you<00:00:51.360> must<00:00:51.539> have

00:00:51.680 --> 00:00:51.690 
or so after the result you must have

00:00:51.690 --> 00:00:53.990 
or so after the result you must have
seen<00:00:51.840> know<00:00:52.079> just<00:00:52.710> how<00:00:52.890> many<00:00:53.129> people<00:00:53.579> saw<00:00:53.850> that

00:00:53.990 --> 00:00:54.000 
seen know just how many people saw that

00:00:54.000 --> 00:00:55.520 
seen know just how many people saw that
result<00:00:54.360> you<00:00:54.480> know<00:00:54.600> worldwide<00:00:55.079> people<00:00:55.440> were

00:00:55.520 --> 00:00:55.530 
result you know worldwide people were

00:00:55.530 --> 00:00:57.020 
result you know worldwide people were
talking<00:00:55.680> about<00:00:55.890> Southampton<00:00:56.579> and<00:00:56.670> that<00:00:57.000> I

00:00:57.020 --> 00:00:57.030

00:01:39.370 --> 00:01:41.970 
and then the next game will be very
difficult<00:01:39.550> in<00:01:39.910> your<00:01:40.060> mind<00:01:40.240> and<00:01:40.420> we<00:01:41.140> know<00:01:41.320> we

00:01:41.970 --> 00:01:41.980 
difficult in your mind and we know we

00:01:41.980 --> 00:01:43.170 
difficult in your mind and we know we
have<00:01:42.010> to<00:01:42.130> give<00:01:42.340> everything<00:01:42.640> to<00:01:42.910> get<00:01:43.030> a<00:01:43.060> good

00:01:43.170 --> 00:01:43.180 
have to give everything to get a good

00:01:43.180 --> 00:01:45.300 
have to give everything to get a good
results<00:01:43.630> and<00:01:43.720> the<00:01:44.440> focus<00:01:44.650> has<00:01:44.860> to<00:01:45.010> be<00:01:45.040> there

00:01:45.300 --> 00:01:45.310 
results and the focus has to be there

00:01:45.310 --> 00:01:47.850 
results and the focus has to be there
and<00:01:45.550> that's<00:01:45.790> why<00:01:45.940> the<00:01:46.420> focus<00:01:46.720> was<00:01:46.860> immediately

00:01:47.850 --> 00:01:47.860 
and that's why the focus was immediately

00:01:47.860 --> 00:01:49.560 
and that's why the focus was immediately
after<00:01:48.070> a<00:01:48.100> game<00:01:48.310> was<00:01:48.430> there<00:01:48.610> I<00:01:48.790> mean<00:01:49.270> it'd<00:01:49.420> be<00:01:49.510> an

00:01:49.560 --> 00:01:49.570 
after a game was there I mean it'd be an

00:01:49.570 --> 00:01:51.360 
after a game was there I mean it'd be an
absolutely<00:01:49.870> shy<00:01:50.050> brunette<00:01:50.260> so<00:01:50.920> we<00:01:51.040> night<00:01:51.220> now

00:01:51.360 --> 00:01:51.370 
absolutely shy brunette so we night now

00:01:51.370 --> 00:01:52.800 
absolutely shy brunette so we night now
and<00:01:51.520> then<00:01:51.610> perhaps<00:01:51.760> not<00:01:52.090> pick<00:01:52.240> up<00:01:52.360> a<00:01:52.510> result

00:01:52.800 --> 00:01:52.810 
and then perhaps not pick up a result

00:01:52.810 --> 00:01:54.270 
and then perhaps not pick up a result
this<00:01:52.930> weekend<00:01:53.350> in<00:01:53.560> a<00:01:53.620> way<00:01:53.740> you'd<00:01:53.890> rather<00:01:54.070> win

00:01:55.860 --> 00:01:55.870

it<00:03:30.430> must<00:03:30.609> be<00:03:30.730> an<00:03:30.790> interesting<00:03:31.000> for<00:03:31.299> you<00:03:31.359> when

00:03:31.470 --> 00:03:31.480 
it must be an interesting for you when

00:03:31.480 --> 00:03:32.970 
it must be an interesting for you when
you<00:03:31.569> go<00:03:31.659> away<00:03:31.780> with<00:03:32.049> belgium<00:03:32.409> to<00:03:32.560> see<00:03:32.709> just<00:03:32.920> how

00:03:32.970 --> 00:03:32.980 
you go away with belgium to see just how

00:03:32.980 --> 00:03:34.289 
you go away with belgium to see just how
many<00:03:33.099> players<00:03:33.640> are<00:03:33.760> in<00:03:33.939> the<00:03:34.000> Premier<00:03:34.269> League

00:03:34.289 --> 00:03:34.299 
many players are in the Premier League

00:03:34.299 --> 00:03:36.149 
many players are in the Premier League
now<00:03:34.599> it<00:03:34.810> seems<00:03:35.019> like<00:03:35.200> all<00:03:35.560> of<00:03:35.620> you<00:03:35.799> guys<00:03:35.950> are

00:03:36.149 --> 00:03:36.159 
now it seems like all of you guys are

00:03:36.159 --> 00:03:37.530 
now it seems like all of you guys are
kind<00:03:36.310> of<00:03:36.370> against<00:03:36.609> each<00:03:36.730> other<00:03:36.939> one<00:03:37.150> week<00:03:37.329> or

00:03:37.530 --> 00:03:37.540 
kind of against each other one week or

00:03:37.540 --> 00:03:39.690 
kind of against each other one week or
so<00:03:37.959> I<00:03:37.989> think<00:03:38.170> against<00:03:38.620> spurs<00:03:38.890> lost<00:03:39.220> mark<00:03:39.519> those

00:03:39.690 --> 00:03:39.700 
so I think against spurs lost mark those

00:03:39.700 --> 00:03:41.160 
so I think against spurs lost mark those
two<00:03:39.939> or<00:03:40.060> three<00:03:40.239> of<00:03:40.329> you<00:03:40.450> your<00:03:40.900> international

00:03:41.160 --> 00:03:41.170 
two or three of you your international

00:03:41.170 --> 00:03:42.899 
two or three of you your international
team<00:03:41.530> mates<00:03:41.739> there<00:03:41.950> was<00:03:42.069> that<00:03:42.189> quite<00:03:42.640> strange

00:03:42.899 --> 00:03:42.909 
team mates there was that quite strange

00:03:42.909 --> 00:03:44.160 
team mates there was that quite strange
for<00:03:43.060> you<00:03:43.120> when<00:03:43.239> you<00:03:43.329> went<00:03:43.480> away<00:03:43.540> of<00:03:43.810> them<00:03:43.959> last

00:03:44.160 --> 00:03:44.170 
for you when you went away of them last

00:03:44.170 --> 00:03:45.960 
for you when you went away of them last
month<00:03:44.290> to<00:03:44.680> meet<00:03:45.099> so<00:03:45.220> many<00:03:45.250> of<00:03:45.430> your<00:03:45.549> friends<00:03:45.639> or

00:03:45.960 --> 00:03:45.970 
month to meet so many of your friends or

00:03:45.970 --> 00:03:49.319 
month to meet so many of your friends or
I<00:03:46.030> think<00:03:46.389> it's<00:03:46.510> quite<00:03:47.349> nice<00:03:48.239> Premier<00:03:49.239> League

00:03:49.319 --> 00:03:49.329 
I think it's quite nice Premier League

00:03:49.329 --> 00:03:51.240 
I think it's quite nice Premier League
is<00:03:49.480> one<00:03:50.139> of<00:03:50.260> the<00:03:50.349> best<00:03:50.560> leagues<00:03:50.829> I<00:03:50.950> think<00:03:51.159> the

00:03:51.240 --> 00:03:51.250 
is one of the best leagues I think the

00:03:51.250 --> 00:03:53.759 
is one of the best leagues I think the
best<00:03:51.430> leaking<00:03:51.790> in<00:03:52.209> Europe<00:03:52.540> so<00:03:52.750> of<00:03:53.379> course<00:03:53.560> it's

00:03:53.759 --> 00:03:53.769 
best leaking in Europe so of course it's

00:03:53.769 --> 00:03:55.879 
best leaking in Europe so of course it's
very<00:03:53.950> good<00:03:54.099> at<00:03:54.250> the<00:03:54.400> National<00:03:55.209> players

00:03:55.879 --> 00:03:55.889 
very good at the National players

00:03:55.889 --> 00:04:00.089 
very good at the National players
playing<00:03:56.889> that<00:03:57.129> leak<00:03:57.310> in<00:03:58.169> almost<00:03:59.169> every<00:03:59.500> week<00:03:59.650> I

00:04:00.089 --> 00:04:00.099 
playing that leak in almost every week I

00:04:00.099 --> 00:04:01.949 
playing that leak in almost every week I
will<00:04:00.220> meet<00:04:00.639> someone<00:04:00.819> so<00:04:01.209> that's<00:04:01.599> very<00:04:01.659> nicely

you if you look too far in the future
it's<00:04:25.810> going<00:04:26.110> to<00:04:26.139> be<00:04:26.229> difficult<00:04:26.440> to<00:04:26.770> see<00:04:26.949> now

00:04:27.180 --> 00:04:27.190 
it's going to be difficult to see now

00:04:27.190 --> 00:04:29.760 
it's going to be difficult to see now
said<00:04:27.610> they<00:04:27.760> stock<00:04:28.030> and<00:04:28.240> the<00:04:28.990> only<00:04:29.289> focus<00:04:29.710> on

00:04:29.760 --> 00:04:29.770 
said they stock and the only focus on

00:04:29.770 --> 00:04:31.500 
said they stock and the only focus on
that<00:04:29.830> game<00:04:30.130> and<00:04:30.340> then<00:04:30.490> after<00:04:31.030> that<00:04:31.180> again<00:04:31.389> we

00:04:31.500 --> 00:04:31.510 
that game and then after that again we

00:04:31.510 --> 00:04:33.149 
that game and then after that again we

00:04:33.149 --> 00:04:33.159 
will focus to the next game and that's

00:04:33.159 --> 00:04:34.980 
will focus to the next game and that's
the<00:04:33.310> way<00:04:33.460> it<00:04:33.639> has<00:04:33.880> to<00:04:34.030> be<00:04:34.150> a<00:04:34.270> thing<00:04:34.479> it's<00:04:34.870> that

00:04:34.980 --> 00:04:34.990 
the way it has to be a thing it's that

00:04:34.990 --> 00:04:36.180 
the way it has to be a thing it's that
quite<00:04:35.199> good<00:04:35.349> actually<00:04:35.470> then<00:04:35.770> that<00:04:35.919> the<00:04:36.010> fact

00:04:36.180 --> 00:04:36.190
