00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.149
 hi to all and the room in this 

00:00:01.740 --> 00:00:05.009
 video we continue the series you are a real 

00:00:03.149 --> 00:00:06.720
 gta 5 player if you know at 

00:00:05.009 --> 00:00:08.849
 program today easter exploit 

00:00:06.720 --> 00:00:09.990
 info you are a real gt5 player when 

00:00:08.849 --> 00:00:11.700
 you know michael parents 

00:00:09.990 --> 00:00:12.990
 santa when you go in the 

00:00:11.700 --> 00:00:14.190
 michael's house and that you go in 

00:00:12.990 --> 00:00:16.740
 his room you can see on the 

00:00:14.190 --> 00:00:18.420
 convenient three pictures one of the wedding of 

00:00:16.740 --> 00:00:20.130
 michael and amanda a family photo 

00:00:18.420 --> 00:00:22.260
 with their two children and a photo of 

00:00:20.130 --> 00:00:23.369
 grandparents of jimmy and stories there one 

00:00:22.260 --> 00:00:25.289
 may wonder if it's parents 

00:00:23.369 --> 00:00:26.640
 a warrant or michael to slice 

00:00:25.289 --> 00:00:28.349
 we must first look at the similarity 

00:00:26.640 --> 00:00:30.150
 when we mix both faces 

00:00:28.349 --> 00:00:31.289
 looks a lot more like michael and 

00:00:30.150 --> 00:00:32.940
 then in the story mode among 

00:00:31.289 --> 00:00:34.170
 all the pictures of a warrant he did not 

00:00:32.940 --> 00:00:36.059
 only one where these two people the 

00:00:34.170 --> 00:00:37.380
 figure and we can be sure that it's not 

00:00:36.059 --> 00:00:39.210
 the neighbors opposite so by deduction 

00:00:37.380 --> 00:00:40.950
 we get michael's parents 

00:00:39.210 --> 00:00:42.989
 there are not many say terreg who 

00:00:40.950 --> 00:00:44.250
 talk about michael it's a shame because 

00:00:42.989 --> 00:00:46.379
 that's still one of the characters 

00:00:44.250 --> 00:00:47.760
 main you are a real gta player 5 

00:00:46.379 --> 00:00:49.260
 when you know a place even more 

00:00:47.760 --> 00:00:51.000
 big in the military base where nobody 

00:00:49.260 --> 00:00:52.289
 does not come to kill you I showed you in 

00:00:51.000 --> 00:00:53.730
 the previous episode a spot that say 

00:00:52.289 --> 00:00:54.989
 about six square meters there it's 

00:00:53.730 --> 00:00:56.550
 outright a big playground in 

00:00:54.989 --> 00:00:58.109
 which you can survive without the 

00:00:56.550 --> 00:00:59.160
 military come to see you there remains 

00:00:58.109 --> 00:01:00.809
 behind the walls they are not enough 

00:00:59.160 --> 00:01:02.609
 smart to take the door 

00:01:00.809 --> 00:01:04.470
 it's the big star should have pushed 

00:01:02.609 --> 00:01:05.580
 a little artificial intelligence the 

00:01:04.470 --> 00:01:06.780
 military he can hit the wall 

00:01:05.580 --> 00:01:08.400
 for six hours in a row he does not 

00:01:06.780 --> 00:01:09.540
 not ask why they not pass 

00:01:08.400 --> 00:01:11.130
 at least could have done them in the image 

00:01:09.540 --> 00:01:12.090
 robot vacuum cleaners when they get 

00:01:11.130 --> 00:01:13.920
 take a wall at least them they 

00:01:12.090 --> 00:01:15.869
 change direction late real players 

00:01:13.920 --> 00:01:17.250
 of gta 5 if you know that even if you have 

00:01:15.869 --> 00:01:19.049
 the flat tires you can continue his 

00:01:17.250 --> 00:01:20.549
 way without turning and I punctured the 

00:01:19.049 --> 00:01:21.570
 back tire voluntarily I tried 

00:01:20.549 --> 00:01:23.340
 as best as I could to go all 

00:01:21.570 --> 00:01:24.900
 right but nothing makes it necessary to stay 

00:01:23.340 --> 00:01:26.850
 concentrated to the maximum plays with his 

00:01:24.900 --> 00:01:28.080
 joystick from start to finish and despite that 

00:01:26.850 --> 00:01:29.640
 the bike she eventually turn to a 

00:01:28.080 --> 00:01:31.259
 moment or another too complicated to 

00:01:29.640 --> 00:01:32.640
 manage you tell me too much 13 

00:01:31.259 --> 00:01:34.409
 nothing while you can do more 

00:01:32.640 --> 00:01:35.970
 simple when you have a flat tire or 

00:01:34.409 --> 00:01:37.170
 the two just make a wheel 

00:01:35.970 --> 00:01:37.470
 back it'll make you go all 

00:01:37.170 --> 00:01:38.850
 law 

00:01:37.470 --> 00:01:40.380
 you will have the impression of time in 

00:01:38.850 --> 00:01:41.939
 time to turn but in reality it's 

00:01:40.380 --> 00:01:43.619
 you who manage your turning because 

00:01:41.939 --> 00:01:44.640
 as you see I'm stabilizing for that 

00:01:43.619 --> 00:01:46.320
 when you do your back wheel 

00:01:44.640 --> 00:01:48.119
 you turn slightly with the joystick 

00:01:46.320 --> 00:01:49.439
 left or right 

00:01:48.119 --> 00:01:50.850
 I hope you have learned from 

00:01:49.439 --> 00:01:52.079
 things today that's all for this 

00:01:50.850 --> 00:01:52.290
 video and I tell you everything at 

00:01:52.079 --> 00:01:54.770
 time 

00:01:52.290 --> 00:01:54.770
 ciao
