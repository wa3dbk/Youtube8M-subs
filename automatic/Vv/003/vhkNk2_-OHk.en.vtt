00:00:01.520 --> 00:00:06.930
 welcome to fun box in team with the bat 

00:00:04.890 --> 00:00:09.929
 phillips link horse 

00:00:06.930 --> 00:00:11.910
 but the model in his in my other 

00:00:09.929 --> 00:00:14.160
 video photo unboxing also of the 

00:00:11.910 --> 00:00:17.400
 Blue walled lamp is the most version 

00:00:14.160 --> 00:00:19.439
 small party and have to open the 

00:00:17.400 --> 00:00:21.270
 box we see the content that either 

00:00:19.439 --> 00:00:26.000
 with that of the other version we have 

00:00:21.270 --> 00:00:26.000
 a battery remote control 

00:00:44.210 --> 00:00:48.590
 we keep the batteries to the questions 

00:00:53.090 --> 00:01:02.070
 first floor wall at the beginning 

00:01:00.329 --> 00:01:03.750
 Advanced connection will make you see a 

00:01:02.070 --> 00:01:06.270
 bit of a color presentation 

00:01:03.750 --> 00:01:08.630
 available and then must be sent to 

00:01:06.270 --> 00:01:08.630
 center 

00:01:09.409 --> 00:01:15.659
 at this moment it is maximum brightness 

00:01:12.450 --> 00:01:18.830
 so it's a lot of light I'll show you in 

00:01:15.659 --> 00:01:18.830
 detail the remote control 

00:01:23.190 --> 00:01:28.360
 then the mechanical remote control then not 

00:01:27.250 --> 00:01:31.570
 it's touch 

00:01:28.360 --> 00:01:37.270
 in the sense that you will have to move the 

00:01:31.570 --> 00:01:41.590
 wheel you will hear the click was at 

00:01:37.270 --> 00:01:48.190
 will change color if you go out to see the 

00:01:41.590 --> 00:01:52.900
 heart that changes colors are very 

00:01:48.190 --> 00:01:55.120
 clear is however you can change the 

00:01:52.900 --> 00:01:57.250
 color type now we have a green 

00:01:55.120 --> 00:02:02.080
 we can do it dark green by pressing 

00:01:57.250 --> 00:02:05.350
 this button toselli provide that 

00:02:02.080 --> 00:02:08.350
 now it is dark green or doing more 

00:02:05.350 --> 00:02:13.480
 clear pressing the opposite always becomes 

00:02:08.350 --> 00:02:16.360
 clearer until you can blank 

00:02:13.480 --> 00:02:19.590
 higher and lower brightness with this 

00:02:16.360 --> 00:02:24.460
 button here so we are now at the maximum 

00:02:19.590 --> 00:02:26.890
 I'll come down and see how it diminishes and then 

00:02:24.460 --> 00:02:27.459
 you can save colors there 

00:02:26.890 --> 00:02:33.580
 like 

00:02:27.459 --> 00:02:39.280
 1 and 2 saves you the color is also the 

00:02:33.580 --> 00:02:42.820
 brightness if you make a complete turn e 

00:02:39.280 --> 00:02:46.000
 then allowing the lamp to go on 

00:02:42.820 --> 00:02:49.570
 automatic color change mode 

00:02:46.000 --> 00:02:53.200
 that is, she changes all the colors she has 

00:02:49.570 --> 00:02:56.470
 automatically this option can also 

00:02:53.200 --> 00:02:58.660
 be slowed for example up to 60 

00:02:56.470 --> 00:03:02.830
 minutes would be the interval in which the 

00:02:58.660 --> 00:03:04.810
 flush changes color and for 

00:03:02.830 --> 00:03:06.220
 slow it down to speed it down 

00:03:04.810 --> 00:03:08.260
 always move this wheel 

00:03:06.220 --> 00:03:14.680
 faster achievement is so 

00:03:08.260 --> 00:03:17.650
 jovanotti half the lamp I do 

00:03:14.680 --> 00:03:19.470
 see the differences in detail 

00:03:17.650 --> 00:03:22.170
 anyway 

00:03:19.470 --> 00:03:26.480
 that other that would be blue is 

00:03:22.170 --> 00:03:29.580
 very very light plastic addition 

00:03:26.480 --> 00:03:32.790
 but there is all plastic so let's say 

00:03:29.580 --> 00:03:41.070
 to a somewhat economic aspect even if it is 

00:03:32.790 --> 00:03:42.780
 more expensive than high transparency then the 

00:03:41.070 --> 00:03:47.370
 moment when you turned on from behind 

00:03:42.780 --> 00:03:49.200
 you can see this effect I do n't know how 

00:03:47.370 --> 00:03:52.230
 explain it there is a colorful effect too 

00:03:49.200 --> 00:03:54.240
 from behind this piece of plastic 

00:03:52.230 --> 00:03:56.970
 transparent illuminates us a little bit 

00:03:54.240 --> 00:03:59.610
 in short, beautiful even by liter instead 

00:03:56.970 --> 00:04:01.940
 the other version behind is all black 

00:03:59.610 --> 00:04:05.340
 so you can't look inside 

00:04:01.940 --> 00:04:07.470
 this has only one stand ie you have to 

00:04:05.340 --> 00:04:09.690
 place it on the table with this part 

00:04:07.470 --> 00:04:12.180
 otherwise it is not maintained therefore if 

00:04:09.690 --> 00:04:16.590
 you want to keep it completely high is not 

00:04:12.180 --> 00:04:24.300
 possible always and only from that 

00:04:16.590 --> 00:04:26.220
 excavation part is not removable and the 

00:04:24.300 --> 00:04:29.370
 considerations on this lamp I have to 

00:04:26.220 --> 00:04:30.990
 say that it is very very powerful in the sense 

00:04:29.370 --> 00:04:32.790
 that light is not expected to be 

00:04:30.990 --> 00:04:35.910
 so strong 

00:04:32.790 --> 00:04:39.840
 philips always advises directing it 

00:04:35.910 --> 00:04:42.990
 towards the wall to have an effect 

00:04:39.840 --> 00:04:44.610
 best on the whole wall never look 

00:04:42.990 --> 00:04:48.000
 in the lamp because as I said ie 

00:04:44.610 --> 00:04:50.490
 very strong of barking to the eyes like 

00:04:48.000 --> 00:04:54.150
 price this here we are on 100 euros 

00:04:50.490 --> 00:04:55.470
 official felix while walter costs not 

00:04:54.150 --> 00:05:00.270
 20 30 euros less 

00:04:55.470 --> 00:05:02.400
 this one is 210 lumens and the other 110 

00:05:00.270 --> 00:05:04.169
 so anyway 

00:05:02.400 --> 00:05:08.910
 if you have a room, enter this one 

00:05:04.169 --> 00:05:10.919
 better if you say a room 

00:05:08.910 --> 00:05:14.639
 small where too much light would go 

00:05:10.919 --> 00:05:16.440
 ruined the environment is better than with 

00:05:14.639 --> 00:05:18.539
 the other then you bought on freak 

00:05:16.440 --> 00:05:20.639
 store or on any store that 

00:05:18.539 --> 00:05:22.889
 sells this kind of thing 

00:05:20.639 --> 00:05:25.410
 if you have questions, you can write to 

00:05:22.889 --> 00:05:27.770
 comments below and thank you for the 

00:05:25.410 --> 00:05:27.770
