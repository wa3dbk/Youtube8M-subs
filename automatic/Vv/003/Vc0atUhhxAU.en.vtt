fantastic visibility the seats are at a
great<00:01:35.070> height<00:01:35.310> you<00:01:35.729> can<00:01:35.850> see<00:01:35.970> everything<00:01:36.450> in

00:01:36.530 --> 00:01:36.540 
great height you can see everything in

00:01:36.540 --> 00:01:38.240 
great height you can see everything in
front<00:01:36.750> of<00:01:36.810> you<00:01:36.900> the<00:01:37.200> greenhouse<00:01:37.590> is<00:01:37.770> huge<00:01:38.040> and

00:01:38.240 --> 00:01:38.250 
front of you the greenhouse is huge and

00:01:38.250 --> 00:01:41.200 
front of you the greenhouse is huge and
there<00:01:38.640> are<00:01:38.729> very<00:01:39.090> very<00:01:39.540> minimal<00:01:40.380> blind<00:01:40.650> spots

00:01:41.200 --> 00:01:41.210 
there are very very minimal blind spots

00:01:41.210 --> 00:01:43.940 
there are very very minimal blind spots
so<00:01:42.210> some<00:01:42.509> say<00:01:42.720> that<00:01:42.750> the<00:01:43.229> exterior<00:01:43.710> is<00:01:43.890> a

00:01:43.940 --> 00:01:43.950 
so some say that the exterior is a

00:01:43.950 --> 00:01:47.120 
so some say that the exterior is a
little<00:01:44.280> too<00:01:44.460> wagon<00:01:45.000> like<00:01:45.240> looking<00:01:45.950> but<00:01:46.950> you

00:01:47.120 --> 00:01:47.130 
little too wagon like looking but you

00:01:47.130 --> 00:01:48.800 
little too wagon like looking but you
know<00:01:47.280> it's<00:01:47.430> got<00:01:47.549> a<00:01:47.579> unique<00:01:47.759> grille<00:01:48.149> treatments

00:01:48.800 --> 00:01:48.810 
know it's got a unique grille treatments

00:01:48.810 --> 00:01:50.870 
know it's got a unique grille treatments
an<00:01:49.140> aerodynamic<00:01:49.829> kit<00:01:50.070> and<00:01:50.399> I<00:01:50.549> think<00:01:50.670> it<00:01:50.759> has<00:01:50.850> a

00:01:50.870 --> 00:01:50.880 
an aerodynamic kit and I think it has a

00:01:50.880 --> 00:01:52.780 
an aerodynamic kit and I think it has a
really<00:01:51.119> nice<00:01:51.390> athletic<00:01:51.659> stance

00:01:52.780 --> 00:01:52.790 
really nice athletic stance

00:01:52.790 --> 00:01:54.910 
really nice athletic stance
it's<00:01:53.240> got<00:01:53.390> a<00:01:53.420> 2-liter<00:01:53.870> four-cylinder<00:01:54.530> engine

00:01:54.910 --> 00:01:54.920 
it's got a 2-liter four-cylinder engine

00:01:54.920 --> 00:01:58.780 
it's got a 2-liter four-cylinder engine
gets<00:01:55.400> 150<00:01:55.820> horsepower<00:01:56.210> at<00:01:56.660> 6200<00:01:57.380> rpm<00:01:57.740> and<00:01:57.920> 140

00:01:58.780 --> 00:01:58.790 
gets 150 horsepower at 6200 rpm and 140

00:02:01.660 --> 00:02:01.670 
pound feet of torque at 4000 rpm it's

00:02:01.670 --> 00:02:03.490 
pound feet of torque at 4000 rpm it's
got<00:02:01.790> a<00:02:01.820> fun<00:02:02.060> engine<00:02:02.420> when<00:02:02.570> you<00:02:02.660> push<00:02:02.930> it<00:02:02.960> but<00:02:03.470> I

00:02:03.490 --> 00:02:03.500 
got a fun engine when you push it but I

00:02:03.500 --> 00:02:04.930 
got a fun engine when you push it but I
wish<00:02:03.710> I<00:02:03.770> had<00:02:03.860> a<00:02:03.920> little<00:02:04.130> bit<00:02:04.310> more<00:02:04.340> low-end

00:02:04.930 --> 00:02:04.940 
wish I had a little bit more low-end

00:02:04.940 --> 00:02:07.630 
wish I had a little bit more low-end
torque<00:02:05.030> for<00:02:05.450> city<00:02:05.630> driving<00:02:06.190> I'm<00:02:07.190> driving<00:02:07.250> the

00:02:07.630 --> 00:02:07.640 
torque for city driving I'm driving the

00:02:07.640 --> 00:02:09.280 
torque for city driving I'm driving the
six-speed<00:02:08.030> manual<00:02:08.060> which<00:02:08.780> when<00:02:08.990> put<00:02:09.200> through

00:02:09.280 --> 00:02:09.290 
six-speed manual which when put through

00:02:09.290 --> 00:02:11.200 
six-speed manual which when put through
its<00:02:09.440> paces<00:02:09.470> is<00:02:09.920> really<00:02:10.310> smooth<00:02:10.700> and<00:02:10.940> very

00:02:11.200 --> 00:02:11.210 
its paces is really smooth and very

00:02:11.210 --> 00:02:13.900 
its paces is really smooth and very

00:02:13.900 --> 00:02:13.910 
precise it handles really nicely a lower

00:02:13.910 --> 00:02:15.610 
precise it handles really nicely a lower
center<00:02:14.240> of<00:02:14.270> gravity<00:02:14.390> keeps<00:02:15.050> it<00:02:15.170> tight<00:02:15.410> in<00:02:15.530> the

00:02:15.610 --> 00:02:15.620 
center of gravity keeps it tight in the

00:02:15.620 --> 00:02:18.670 
center of gravity keeps it tight in the
turns<00:02:16.210> now<00:02:17.210> it's<00:02:17.390> not<00:02:17.510> the<00:02:17.660> fastest<00:02:18.260> thing<00:02:18.320> on

00:02:18.670 --> 00:02:18.680 
turns now it's not the fastest thing on

00:02:18.680 --> 00:02:20.650 
turns now it's not the fastest thing on
the<00:02:18.800> road<00:02:18.980> but<00:02:19.610> it's<00:02:19.790> like<00:02:19.970> that<00:02:20.090> saying<00:02:20.420> it's

00:02:20.650 --> 00:02:20.660 
the road but it's like that saying it's

00:02:20.660 --> 00:02:21.940 
the road but it's like that saying it's
more<00:02:20.810> fun<00:02:20.990> to<00:02:21.020> drive<00:02:21.230> the<00:02:21.410> slow<00:02:21.590> car<00:02:21.800> quickly

00:02:21.940 --> 00:02:21.950 
more fun to drive the slow car quickly

00:02:21.950 --> 00:02:23.560 
more fun to drive the slow car quickly
than<00:02:22.250> it<00:02:22.340> is<00:02:22.430> to<00:02:22.550> drive<00:02:22.640> a<00:02:22.730> fast<00:02:23.030> car<00:02:23.270> slowly

00:02:23.560 --> 00:02:23.570 
than it is to drive a fast car slowly

00:02:23.570 --> 00:02:25.900 
than it is to drive a fast car slowly
and<00:02:23.960> you<00:02:24.620> know<00:02:24.710> this<00:02:24.860> isn't<00:02:25.010> a<00:02:25.220> race<00:02:25.400> car<00:02:25.700> this
