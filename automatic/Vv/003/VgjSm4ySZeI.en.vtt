so<00:00:00.659> for<00:00:01.020> our<00:00:01.230> last<00:00:02.120> video<00:00:03.120> on<00:00:03.389> programming

00:00:04.190 --> 00:00:04.200 
so for our last video on programming

00:00:04.200 --> 00:00:06.349 
so for our last video on programming
reggae<00:00:04.950> drumbeat<00:00:05.400> I<00:00:05.549> just<00:00:05.819> like<00:00:05.970> to<00:00:06.089> play<00:00:06.299> you

00:00:06.349 --> 00:00:06.359 
reggae drumbeat I just like to play you

00:00:06.359 --> 00:00:08.720 
reggae drumbeat I just like to play you
a<00:00:06.690> bit<00:00:06.899> of<00:00:06.990> a<00:00:07.109> track<00:00:07.770> which<00:00:08.189> is<00:00:08.220> a<00:00:08.370> different

00:00:08.720 --> 00:00:08.730 
a bit of a track which is a different

00:00:08.730 --> 00:00:40.020 
a bit of a track which is a different
kind<00:00:08.880> of<00:00:09.000> beat

00:00:40.020 --> 00:00:40.030 

00:00:40.030 --> 00:00:42.400 

so<00:00:41.030> it's<00:00:41.150> very<00:00:41.270> similar<00:00:41.570> to<00:00:41.780> the<00:00:41.870> other<00:00:41.990> reggae

00:00:42.400 --> 00:00:42.410 
so it's very similar to the other reggae

00:00:42.410 --> 00:00:44.590 
so it's very similar to the other reggae
beats<00:00:42.650> that<00:00:42.920> we<00:00:42.950> have<00:00:43.370> studied<00:00:43.820> but<00:00:44.180> there<00:00:44.450> is

00:00:44.590 --> 00:00:44.600 
beats that we have studied but there is

00:00:44.600 --> 00:00:46.930 
beats that we have studied but there is
one<00:00:44.870> very<00:00:45.380> subtle<00:00:45.830> difference<00:00:46.310> and<00:00:46.490> it's<00:00:46.700> in

00:00:46.930 --> 00:00:46.940 
one very subtle difference and it's in

00:00:46.940 --> 00:00:49.720 
one very subtle difference and it's in
the<00:00:47.270> feel<00:00:47.660> of<00:00:47.870> the<00:00:48.110> hi-hat<00:00:48.560> we've<00:00:49.190> been<00:00:49.460> doing

00:00:49.720 --> 00:00:49.730 
the feel of the hi-hat we've been doing

00:00:49.730 --> 00:00:51.880 
the feel of the hi-hat we've been doing
everything<00:00:50.090> very<00:00:50.330> very<00:00:50.390> straight<00:00:50.990> with<00:00:51.710> our

00:00:51.880 --> 00:00:51.890 
everything very very straight with our

00:00:51.890 --> 00:00:59.800 
everything very very straight with our
beats<00:00:52.130> like<00:00:52.490> this<00:00:57.850> but<00:00:58.850> this<00:00:59.030> beats<00:00:59.360> which

00:00:59.800 --> 00:00:59.810 
beats like this but this beats which

00:00:59.810 --> 00:01:02.080 
beats like this but this beats which
we'll<00:01:00.020> call<00:01:00.230> the<00:01:00.290> rockers<00:01:00.770> beat<00:01:01.010> and<00:01:01.280> has<00:01:02.030> a

00:01:02.080 --> 00:01:02.090 
we'll call the rockers beat and has a

00:01:02.090 --> 00:01:06.490 
we'll call the rockers beat and has a
slight<00:01:02.540> Skippy<00:01:03.440> feel<00:01:04.070> or<00:01:04.339> a<00:01:04.810> shuffle<00:01:05.810> feel<00:01:06.050> to

00:01:06.490 --> 00:01:06.500 
slight Skippy feel or a shuffle feel to

00:01:06.500 --> 00:01:13.290 
slight Skippy feel or a shuffle feel to
the<00:01:06.620> hi-hat<00:01:07.010> it<00:01:07.550> sounds<00:01:07.970> more<00:01:08.090> like<00:01:08.150> this

00:01:13.290 --> 00:01:13.300 

00:01:13.300 --> 00:01:15.550 

there's<00:01:14.300> a<00:01:14.420> small<00:01:14.690> change<00:01:14.930> but<00:01:15.170> it<00:01:15.260> makes<00:01:15.440> all

00:01:15.550 --> 00:01:15.560 
there's a small change but it makes all

00:01:15.560 --> 00:01:16.570 
there's a small change but it makes all
the<00:01:15.619> difference<00:01:15.800> in<00:01:16.070> the<00:01:16.130> world<00:01:16.310> it's<00:01:16.520> really

00:01:16.570 --> 00:01:16.580 
the difference in the world it's really

00:01:16.580 --> 00:01:18.520 
the difference in the world it's really
important<00:01:17.180> to<00:01:17.300> be<00:01:17.420> able<00:01:17.510> to<00:01:17.690> work<00:01:17.869> in<00:01:18.080> this

00:01:18.520 --> 00:01:18.530 
important to be able to work in this

00:01:18.530 --> 00:01:20.710 
important to be able to work in this
kind<00:01:18.830> of<00:01:18.890> feel<00:01:19.130> as<00:01:19.369> well<00:01:19.550> in<00:01:19.790> logic<00:01:20.479> now<00:01:20.600> I'm

00:01:20.710 --> 00:01:20.720 
kind of feel as well in logic now I'm

time I'm going to put in a kick drum on
the<00:01:37.250> one-drop<00:01:37.729> which<00:01:38.330> just<00:01:38.540> means<00:01:38.750> beat<00:01:38.990> three

00:01:39.330 --> 00:01:39.340 
the one-drop which just means beat three

and<00:01:40.340> also<00:01:40.490> a<00:01:40.910> rim<00:01:41.330> click<00:01:41.570> on<00:01:41.780> beat<00:01:42.410> free<00:01:42.680> also

00:01:42.880 --> 00:01:42.890 
and also a rim click on beat free also

00:01:42.890 --> 00:01:56.649 
and also a rim click on beat free also
like<00:01:43.460> this<00:01:54.640> those<00:01:55.640> notes<00:01:56.120> are<00:01:56.270> quite<00:01:56.480> accurate

00:01:56.649 --> 00:01:56.659 
like this those notes are quite accurate

00:01:56.659 --> 00:01:59.920 
like this those notes are quite accurate
but<00:01:57.080> I<00:01:57.110> just<00:01:57.320> wanted<00:01:57.680> to<00:01:58.330> quantize<00:01:59.330> those<00:01:59.600> um

00:01:59.920 --> 00:01:59.930 
but I just wanted to quantize those um

00:01:59.930 --> 00:02:02.710 
but I just wanted to quantize those um
so<00:02:00.560> I'm<00:02:00.620> going<00:02:00.770> to<00:02:00.830> press<00:02:01.010> the<00:02:01.159> Q<00:02:01.430> on<00:02:01.640> that<00:02:01.880> just

00:02:02.710 --> 00:02:02.720 
so I'm going to press the Q on that just

00:02:02.720 --> 00:02:04.240 
so I'm going to press the Q on that just
to<00:02:02.810> move<00:02:02.960> them<00:02:03.200> on<00:02:03.380> the<00:02:03.800> line<00:02:03.920> make<00:02:04.220> sure

00:02:04.240 --> 00:02:04.250 
to move them on the line make sure

00:02:04.250 --> 00:02:07.060 
to move them on the line make sure
they're<00:02:04.520> totally<00:02:04.880> in<00:02:04.970> time<00:02:05.210> now<00:02:05.900> to<00:02:06.710> make<00:02:06.890> our

00:02:07.060 --> 00:02:07.070 
they're totally in time now to make our

00:02:07.070 --> 00:02:10.030 
they're totally in time now to make our
shuffle<00:02:07.970> hi-hat<00:02:08.899> fill<00:02:09.200> I<00:02:09.380> need<00:02:09.679> to<00:02:09.830> make<00:02:10.010> one

shuffle hi-hat fill I need to make one
change<00:02:10.220> to<00:02:10.640> logic<00:02:11.150> and<00:02:11.390> it's<00:02:11.540> down<00:02:11.750> here<00:02:12.459> where

00:02:13.449 --> 00:02:13.459 
change to logic and it's down here where

00:02:13.459 --> 00:02:16.420 
change to logic and it's down here where
it<00:02:13.610> says<00:02:13.660> 16<00:02:14.660> that<00:02:15.230> means<00:02:15.290> that<00:02:15.860> the<00:02:15.980> grid<00:02:16.250> is

00:02:16.420 --> 00:02:16.430 
it says 16 that means that the grid is

00:02:16.430 --> 00:02:19.300 
it says 16 that means that the grid is
divided<00:02:17.030> each<00:02:17.300> bar<00:02:17.750> into<00:02:18.080> 16<00:02:18.590> strips<00:02:19.070> and

00:02:19.300 --> 00:02:19.310 
divided each bar into 16 strips and

00:02:19.310 --> 00:02:21.910 
divided each bar into 16 strips and
we're<00:02:19.430> going<00:02:19.550> to<00:02:19.580> change<00:02:19.760> that<00:02:20.030> to<00:02:20.239> 12<00:02:20.920> double

00:02:21.910 --> 00:02:21.920 
we're going to change that to 12 double

00:02:21.920 --> 00:02:24.880 
we're going to change that to 12 double
click<00:02:22.100> and<00:02:22.480> type<00:02:23.480> 12<00:02:23.900> look<00:02:24.500> what<00:02:24.620> happened<00:02:24.830> to

00:02:37.000 --> 00:02:40.449 
beat now has one two three one two three
whereas<00:02:38.000> before<00:02:38.390> it<00:02:38.660> was<00:02:38.930> one<00:02:39.170> two<00:02:39.440> three<00:02:40.010> four

00:02:40.449 --> 00:02:40.459

whereas before it was one two three four
now<00:02:40.670> I'm<00:02:41.239> going<00:02:41.390> to<00:02:41.450> try<00:02:41.630> and<00:02:41.750> make<00:02:41.930> the

00:02:42.190 --> 00:02:42.200 
now I'm going to try and make the

00:02:42.200 --> 00:02:44.680 
now I'm going to try and make the
shuffle<00:02:42.920> hi-hat<00:02:43.340> pattern<00:02:43.790> I'm<00:02:44.299> going<00:02:44.510> to<00:02:44.570> try

00:02:44.680 --> 00:02:44.690 
shuffle hi-hat pattern I'm going to try

00:02:44.690 --> 00:02:46.150 
shuffle hi-hat pattern I'm going to try
and<00:02:44.780> play<00:02:44.959> it<00:02:44.989> live<00:02:45.230> then<00:02:45.890> I'm<00:02:45.980> going<00:02:46.130> to

00:02:46.150 --> 00:02:46.160 
and play it live then I'm going to

00:02:46.160 --> 00:02:54.860 
and play it live then I'm going to
quantize<00:02:46.549> it

00:02:54.860 --> 00:02:54.870 

00:02:54.870 --> 00:02:57.839 

let's<00:02:55.870> do<00:02:56.019> that<00:02:56.170> thing<00:02:56.349> again<00:02:56.379> where<00:02:56.889> I<00:02:56.920> merge

00:02:57.839 --> 00:02:57.849 
let's do that thing again where I merge

00:02:57.849 --> 00:03:01.170 
let's do that thing again where I merge
the<00:02:58.749> regions<00:02:59.560> on<00:02:59.799> top<00:03:00.040> of<00:03:00.129> each<00:03:00.249> other<00:03:00.459> by

00:03:01.170 --> 00:03:01.180 
the regions on top of each other by

00:03:01.180 --> 00:03:06.089 
the regions on top of each other by
selecting<00:03:01.840> them<00:03:02.129> going<00:03:03.129> to<00:03:03.249> region<00:03:03.700> merge<00:03:05.099> and

00:03:06.089 --> 00:03:06.099 
selecting them going to region merge and

00:03:06.099 --> 00:03:08.699 
selecting them going to region merge and
hit<00:03:06.340> the<00:03:06.459> region<00:03:06.670> there<00:03:07.090> now<00:03:07.870> the<00:03:07.930> beats<00:03:08.349> and

00:03:08.699 --> 00:03:08.709 
hit the region there now the beats and

00:03:08.709 --> 00:03:11.220 
hit the region there now the beats and
all<00:03:09.129> in<00:03:09.519> the<00:03:09.579> same<00:03:09.790> window<00:03:10.299> so<00:03:10.810> that's<00:03:10.900> good

00:03:11.220 --> 00:03:11.230 
all in the same window so that's good

00:03:11.230 --> 00:03:16.589 
all in the same window so that's good
let's<00:03:11.769> have<00:03:11.920> a<00:03:11.950> little<00:03:12.099> look<00:03:12.340> up<00:03:12.549> close<00:03:13.680> mmm<00:03:15.599> my

00:03:16.589 --> 00:03:16.599 
let's have a little look up close mmm my

00:03:16.599 --> 00:03:18.989 
let's have a little look up close mmm my
high<00:03:16.810> hats<00:03:17.049> are<00:03:17.230> not<00:03:17.260> in<00:03:17.560> time<00:03:17.799> yet<00:03:18.099> I<00:03:18.340> need<00:03:18.909> to

high hats are not in time yet I need to

00:03:18.999 --> 00:03:21.479 
high hats are not in time yet I need to
do<00:03:19.120> a<00:03:19.150> quantize<00:03:19.689> on<00:03:19.959> them<00:03:20.169> but<00:03:20.530> I<00:03:20.560> need<00:03:20.859> to<00:03:21.010> do<00:03:21.219> a

00:03:21.479 --> 00:03:21.489 
do a quantize on them but I need to do a

00:03:21.489 --> 00:03:24.089 
do a quantize on them but I need to do a
slightly<00:03:22.060> different<00:03:22.569> type<00:03:23.169> of<00:03:23.200> quantize<00:03:23.769> I'll

00:03:24.089 --> 00:03:24.099 
slightly different type of quantize I'll

00:03:24.099 --> 00:03:27.149 
slightly different type of quantize I'll

00:03:27.149 --> 00:03:27.159 
hit the hi-hat f-sharp 1 on the keyboard

00:03:27.159 --> 00:03:30.629 
hit the hi-hat f-sharp 1 on the keyboard
on<00:03:27.579> the<00:03:27.969> screen<00:03:28.239> that<00:03:28.959> selects<00:03:29.530> them<00:03:29.709> and<00:03:29.949> are

on the screen that selects them and are

00:03:30.639 --> 00:03:32.640 
on the screen that selects them and are
going<00:03:30.790> to<00:03:30.879> do<00:03:31.000> a<00:03:31.030> quantize<00:03:31.510> but<00:03:31.900> I'm<00:03:32.169> not<00:03:32.409> going

00:03:32.640 --> 00:03:32.650 
going to do a quantize but I'm not going

00:03:32.650 --> 00:03:35.939 
going to do a quantize but I'm not going
to<00:03:32.739> do<00:03:32.879> sixteenth<00:03:33.879> notes<00:03:34.209> quantize<00:03:34.689> I'm<00:03:35.079> going

00:03:35.939 --> 00:03:35.949 
to do sixteenth notes quantize I'm going

00:03:35.949 --> 00:03:41.129 
to do sixteenth notes quantize I'm going
to<00:03:36.069> do<00:03:36.359> twelve<00:03:37.359> no<00:03:37.569> to<00:03:37.629> quantize<00:03:39.930> that<00:03:40.930> now

00:03:41.129 --> 00:03:41.139 
to do twelve no to quantize that now

notes<00:03:45.480> grid<00:03:46.480> like<00:03:46.930> this<00:04:00.150> now<00:04:01.150> if<00:04:01.329> I<00:04:01.449> was<00:04:01.569> to

00:04:01.589 --> 00:04:01.599 
notes grid like this now if I was to

00:04:01.599 --> 00:04:02.849 
notes grid like this now if I was to
spend<00:04:01.870> more<00:04:01.959> time<00:04:02.019> on<00:04:02.259> that<00:04:02.560> I'd<00:04:02.739> probably

00:04:02.849 --> 00:04:02.859 
spend more time on that I'd probably

00:04:02.859 --> 00:04:04.979 
spend more time on that I'd probably
change<00:04:03.280> some<00:04:03.549> of<00:04:03.579> the<00:04:03.699> velocities<00:04:04.180> the

00:04:04.979 --> 00:04:04.989 
change some of the velocities the

00:04:04.989 --> 00:04:08.159 
change some of the velocities the
important<00:04:05.680> high<00:04:05.829> hats<00:04:06.099> like<00:04:06.819> this<00:04:06.879> one<00:04:07.329> this

00:04:08.159 --> 00:04:08.169 
important high hats like this one this

00:04:08.169 --> 00:04:10.379 
important high hats like this one this
one<00:04:08.530> this<00:04:08.799> one<00:04:09.189> the<00:04:09.310> ones<00:04:09.519> on<00:04:09.729> the<00:04:09.849> thick<00:04:10.090> lines

00:04:10.379 --> 00:04:10.389 
one this one the ones on the thick lines

00:04:10.389 --> 00:04:12.869 
one this one the ones on the thick lines
or<00:04:10.989> they<00:04:11.229> need<00:04:11.379> to<00:04:11.439> be<00:04:11.620> louder<00:04:11.889> whereas<00:04:12.759> the

00:04:12.869 --> 00:04:12.879 
or they need to be louder whereas the

00:04:12.879 --> 00:04:16.259 
or they need to be louder whereas the
ones<00:04:13.060> in<00:04:13.239> between<00:04:13.769> need<00:04:14.769> to<00:04:14.889> be<00:04:15.069> quieter<00:04:15.849> but

00:04:16.259 --> 00:04:16.269 
ones in between need to be quieter but

00:04:16.269 --> 00:04:17.219 
ones in between need to be quieter but
I'm<00:04:16.359> not<00:04:16.449> going<00:04:16.570> to<00:04:16.630> do<00:04:16.690> that<00:04:16.780> on<00:04:16.900> the<00:04:16.959> video

00:04:17.219 --> 00:04:17.229 
I'm not going to do that on the video

00:04:17.229 --> 00:04:19.740 
I'm not going to do that on the video
because<00:04:17.560> I<00:04:17.590> think<00:04:17.739> by<00:04:18.099> now<00:04:18.340> you<00:04:18.970> can<00:04:19.209> do<00:04:19.720> your

00:04:19.740 --> 00:04:19.750 
because I think by now you can do your

00:04:19.750 --> 00:04:22.620 
because I think by now you can do your
own<00:04:19.930> velocity<00:04:20.380> anything<00:04:21.370> I'm<00:04:21.579> so<00:04:22.270> good<00:04:22.479> luck

00:04:22.620 --> 00:04:22.630 
own velocity anything I'm so good luck

00:04:22.630 --> 00:04:24.870 
own velocity anything I'm so good luck
with<00:04:22.690> this<00:04:22.960> the<00:04:23.199> third<00:04:23.710> and<00:04:24.099> last<00:04:24.130> reggae

00:04:24.870 --> 00:04:24.880

00:04:24.880 --> 00:04:27.510 
with this the third and last reggae
drumbeat<00:04:25.300> that<00:04:25.780> we're<00:04:25.900> going<00:04:26.050> to<00:04:26.169> do<00:04:26.520> good

00:04:27.510 --> 00:04:27.520 
drumbeat that we're going to do good

00:04:27.520 --> 00:04:29.699 
drumbeat that we're going to do good
luck
