00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:20.130
 aw goin well ok it's everybody 

00:00:17.910 --> 00:00:23.070
 know lips today we end up 

00:00:20.130 --> 00:00:24.539
 for for just a big big project 

00:00:23.070 --> 00:00:25.920
 which took a long time to get from the greenhouse 

00:00:24.539 --> 00:00:26.730
 everyone so that there are the codes of 

00:00:25.920 --> 00:00:28.560
 cheat is open 

00:00:26.730 --> 00:00:30.300
 so good the insubordinate on the commune of 

00:00:28.560 --> 00:00:33.510
 street was quiet I could 

00:00:30.300 --> 00:00:34.739
 look al arbor camps are then him 

00:00:33.510 --> 00:00:37.290
 what else is it 

00:00:34.739 --> 00:00:39.180
 all that I explained to you for 

00:00:37.290 --> 00:00:41.300
 just no no I check my exit 

00:00:39.180 --> 00:00:43.260
 because here it's weird 

00:00:41.300 --> 00:00:44.700
 so here I have so what is that 

00:00:43.260 --> 00:00:46.440
 it's at school the cool thing then 

00:00:44.700 --> 00:00:47.789
 only explain just 

00:00:46.440 --> 00:00:50.309
 of age is whether there are two three 

00:00:47.789 --> 00:00:52.469
 weeks I'm told why do not you 

00:00:50.309 --> 00:00:54.780
 do a project that would really 

00:00:52.469 --> 00:00:57.960
 interactive is registered subscribers or 

00:00:54.780 --> 00:00:58.890
 simply simply you can 

00:00:57.960 --> 00:01:00.930
 teach them a little float 

00:00:58.890 --> 00:01:02.520
 directly the shot has made this 

00:01:00.930 --> 00:01:04.439
 collaborative video fight someone 

00:01:02.520 --> 00:01:07.140
 so not necessarily directly 

00:01:04.439 --> 00:01:08.610
 I thought about rule so that's why 

00:01:07.140 --> 00:01:10.560
 do they mock that with me on 

00:01:08.610 --> 00:01:12.780
 this collaboration so here are the 

00:01:10.560 --> 00:01:14.100
 people just as the title says we're going 

00:01:12.780 --> 00:01:16.409
 you learn to throw yourself so that 

00:01:14.100 --> 00:01:18.000
 starts for teachers and suddenly 

00:01:16.409 --> 00:01:19.770
 what we are going to teach you is to 

00:01:18.000 --> 00:01:21.330
 beginners just threw everything so why 

00:01:19.770 --> 00:01:22.799
 it starts in because of simply 

00:01:21.330 --> 00:01:23.850
 experienced Saharan people 

00:01:22.799 --> 00:01:26.159
 you learn something since 

00:01:23.850 --> 00:01:30.030
 you lend already knows all this does not 

00:01:26.159 --> 00:01:32.100
 would be useless so here is the 

00:01:30.030 --> 00:01:32.700
 beginners or people and a little bit of 

00:01:32.100 --> 00:01:34.740
 wrong 

00:01:32.700 --> 00:01:36.630
 how to manifest is very simple 

00:01:34.740 --> 00:01:38.189
 you just have to mark 

00:01:36.630 --> 00:01:40.799
 in the comments yes for example 

00:01:38.189 --> 00:01:42.750
 I'm going to price I'm on xbox and ps3 

00:01:40.799 --> 00:01:45.600
 because 8 races passed on xbox 

00:01:42.750 --> 00:01:46.590
 and ps3 so the so that's going to know some 

00:01:45.600 --> 00:01:49.049
 one or two weeks sessions 

00:01:46.590 --> 00:01:51.600
 blocked in groups of 4-5 subscribers 

00:01:49.049 --> 00:01:53.700
 this is the first and second 

00:01:51.600 --> 00:01:55.170
 week me I will handle the ps3 to 

00:01:53.700 --> 00:01:57.329
 jacques of the xbox and then I will go on 

00:01:55.170 --> 00:01:58.619
 xbox will always be dry evokes these 

00:01:57.329 --> 00:01:59.759
 it's just if you have to tell 

00:01:58.619 --> 00:02:01.530
 it is that to moan against jacques hemond 

00:01:59.759 --> 00:02:03.000
 would be together and we will be more about 

00:02:01.530 --> 00:02:05.240
 xbox usurped too much because simply 

00:02:03.000 --> 00:02:06.940
 berne foiling microsoft xbox so 

00:02:05.240 --> 00:02:10.690
 necessarily 

00:02:06.940 --> 00:02:11.190
 preferred preferred water for 

00:02:10.690 --> 00:02:13.750
 far 

00:02:11.190 --> 00:02:15.010
 play on xbox that's it but do you 

00:02:13.750 --> 00:02:16.420

00:02:15.010 --> 00:02:18.640

00:02:16.420 --> 00:02:21.700

 video of myself I did not grow 

00:02:45.400 --> 00:02:49.990
 short we do not care so there was a 

00:02:47.290 --> 00:02:52.210
 another which will be mandatory for 

00:02:49.990 --> 00:02:57.070

00:03:00.370 --> 00:03:05.500
 this series is simply 

00:03:02.560 --> 00:03:07.960
 have a microphone the side 3 the microphone will be 

00:03:05.500 --> 00:03:09.220
 obligatory I do shit I 

00:03:07.960 --> 00:03:10.780

00:03:13.570 --> 00:03:18.580
 I can do what I do is 

00:03:16.870 --> 00:03:20.410
 okay, you will not learn the complex 

00:03:18.580 --> 00:03:21.610
 wish it is over a few months 

00:03:20.410 --> 00:03:24.610
 already the complex is not my thing 

00:03:21.610 --> 00:03:25.630
 finally good so it's ready 

00:03:24.610 --> 00:03:28.959
 everything they know we want saplings 

00:03:25.630 --> 00:03:30.700

00:03:30.700 --> 00:03:34.120
 feel as soon as the number of her is 

00:03:32.170 --> 00:03:36.340
 still a lot of success so the 

00:03:34.120 --> 00:03:37.989
 number 3 can not be expected 

00:03:36.340 --> 00:03:39.000

00:04:03.720 --> 00:04:06.959
 we prove a lot of time it's 

00:04:05.220 --> 00:04:10.310
