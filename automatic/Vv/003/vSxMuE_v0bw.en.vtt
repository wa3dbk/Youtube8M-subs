which<00:00:18.750> i'm<00:00:18.900> using<00:00:19.199> can<00:00:19.320> do<00:00:19.439> some<00:00:19.619> of<00:00:19.650> this<00:00:19.830> but

00:00:20.090 --> 00:00:20.100

selection<00:01:30.299> now<00:01:31.049> I<00:01:31.079> could<00:01:31.590> go<00:01:31.740> over<00:01:32.040> to<00:01:32.130> the

00:01:32.210 --> 00:01:32.220 
selection now I could go over to the

00:01:32.220 --> 00:01:34.640 
selection now I could go over to the
mask<00:01:32.750> holding<00:01:33.750> down<00:01:33.780> the<00:01:33.960> option<00:01:33.990> or<00:01:34.380> Alt<00:01:34.530> key

mask holding down the option or Alt key
again<00:01:35.040> and<00:01:35.189> I<00:01:35.790> could<00:01:36.000> fill<00:01:36.240> it<00:01:36.360> but<00:01:36.540> look<00:01:36.689> what

00:01:36.800 --> 00:01:36.810 
again and I could fill it but look what

00:01:36.810 --> 00:01:42.800 
again and I could fill it but look what
happens<00:01:37.140> if<00:01:37.290> I<00:01:37.409> try<00:01:37.470> doing<00:01:37.890> that<00:01:39.320> go<00:01:40.320> to<00:01:41.810> edit

00:01:49.460 --> 00:01:49.470 
whole thing because what I actually have

00:01:49.470 --> 00:01:51.649 
whole thing because what I actually have
masks<00:01:49.770> here<00:01:50.070> let<00:01:50.280> me<00:01:50.369> zoom<00:01:50.520> out<00:01:50.640> so<00:01:50.700> I<00:01:50.880> can<00:01:51.119> show

00:01:51.649 --> 00:01:51.659 
masks here let me zoom out so I can show

00:01:51.659 --> 00:01:54.350 
masks here let me zoom out so I can show
you<00:01:51.720> is<00:01:51.960> the<00:01:52.649> entire<00:01:53.310> picture<00:01:53.610> see<00:01:54.060> where<00:01:54.210> the

you is the entire picture see where the
little<00:01:55.490> marching<00:01:56.490> ants<00:01:56.790> are<00:01:57.770> that's<00:01:58.770> not<00:01:59.159> what

00:01:59.330 --> 00:01:59.340 
little marching ants are that's not what

00:01:59.340 --> 00:02:02.350 
little marching ants are that's not what
I<00:01:59.369> wanted<00:01:59.729> so<00:02:00.659> I'm<00:02:00.990> going<00:02:01.049> to<00:02:01.259> undo<00:02:01.680> that<00:02:01.860> I

00:02:02.350 --> 00:02:02.360 
I wanted so I'm going to undo that I

00:02:02.360 --> 00:02:05.060 
I wanted so I'm going to undo that I
could<00:02:03.360> of<00:02:03.570> course<00:02:03.780> always<00:02:04.049> invert<00:02:04.710> the

00:02:05.060 --> 00:02:05.070 
could of course always invert the

00:02:05.070 --> 00:02:10.080 
could of course always invert the
selection<00:02:05.520> here<00:02:06.090> go<00:02:06.659> to<00:02:06.719> select<00:02:07.520> inverse

00:02:10.080 --> 00:02:10.090 
selection here go to select inverse

00:02:10.090 --> 00:02:14.259 
selection here go to select inverse
and<00:02:11.439> I<00:02:12.439> could<00:02:12.650> fill<00:02:12.860> it<00:02:13.010> then<00:02:13.250> I'm<00:02:13.760> going<00:02:14.090> to<00:02:14.120> do

00:02:14.259 --> 00:02:14.269 
and I could fill it then I'm going to do

00:02:14.269 --> 00:02:15.640 
and I could fill it then I'm going to do
it<00:02:14.360> the<00:02:14.420> easy<00:02:14.569> way<00:02:14.689> now<00:02:14.930> by<00:02:15.079> holding<00:02:15.409> down<00:02:15.439> the

button that's all backspace on a PC and
if<00:02:22.879> I<00:02:22.970> drop<00:02:23.180> the<00:02:23.299> selection<00:02:23.750> sure<00:02:24.019> enough<00:02:24.260> I

00:02:24.460 --> 00:02:24.470 
if I drop the selection sure enough I

00:02:24.470 --> 00:02:28.539 
if I drop the selection sure enough I
have<00:02:24.860> a<00:02:24.890> little<00:02:25.129> white<00:02:25.700> line<00:02:25.939> there<00:02:25.970> and<00:02:27.549> you

00:02:28.539 --> 00:02:28.549 
have a little white line there and you

00:02:28.549 --> 00:02:29.680 
have a little white line there and you
can't<00:02:28.790> see<00:02:28.940> it<00:02:29.030> because<00:02:29.120> it<00:02:29.209> wasn't<00:02:29.540> anything

00:02:29.680 --> 00:02:29.690 
can't see it because it wasn't anything

00:02:29.690 --> 00:02:31.930 
can't see it because it wasn't anything
in<00:02:29.810> particular<00:02:29.930> but<00:02:30.319> that<00:02:30.470> is<00:02:30.620> showing<00:02:31.459> on<00:02:31.760> the

mouse here but once again I want to
actually<00:02:34.430> see<00:02:35.090> the<00:02:35.209> mask<00:02:35.420> while<00:02:35.750> I'm<00:02:35.930> working

00:02:36.039 --> 00:02:36.049 
actually see the mask while I'm working

00:02:36.049 --> 00:02:37.599 
actually see the mask while I'm working
and<00:02:36.319> I<00:02:36.409> can't<00:02:36.650> do<00:02:36.799> that<00:02:36.920> with<00:02:37.099> that<00:02:37.190> quick<00:02:37.370> mask

00:02:37.599 --> 00:02:37.609 
and I can't do that with that quick mask

00:02:37.609 --> 00:02:40.869 
and I can't do that with that quick mask
button<00:02:37.909> so<00:02:38.840> I'm<00:02:38.959> going<00:02:38.989> to<00:02:39.489> undo<00:02:40.489> this<00:02:40.640> i'm

button so I'm going to undo this i'm

00:02:40.879 --> 00:02:43.420 
button so I'm going to undo this i'm
going<00:02:41.030> to<00:02:41.090> hold<00:02:41.390> down<00:02:41.510> the<00:02:41.959> option<00:02:42.200> key<00:02:43.129> that's

alt on a pc and hit commands you a
couple<00:02:45.260> of<00:02:45.319> times<00:02:45.470> so<00:02:45.709> i<00:02:45.769> can<00:02:45.980> undo<00:02:46.640> a<00:02:46.670> couple

couple of times so i can undo a couple
of<00:02:47.060> steps<00:02:47.239> and<00:02:48.220> i'm<00:02:49.220> going<00:02:49.400> to<00:02:49.489> go<00:02:49.730> back<00:02:50.569> to<00:02:50.599> the

00:02:53.920 --> 00:02:53.930 
image there is a way to see the mask

00:02:53.930 --> 00:02:55.960 
image there is a way to see the mask
while<00:02:54.290> you're<00:02:54.500> working<00:02:54.829> the<00:02:55.400> way<00:02:55.549> that<00:02:55.579> you<00:02:55.819> do

00:02:55.960 --> 00:02:55.970 
while you're working the way that you do

00:02:55.970 --> 00:02:58.240 
while you're working the way that you do
it<00:02:56.090> is<00:02:56.239> you<00:02:56.690> hold<00:02:57.139> down<00:02:57.260> the<00:02:57.470> shift<00:02:57.500> key<00:02:57.859> and

00:02:58.240 --> 00:02:58.250 
it is you hold down the shift key and

00:02:58.250 --> 00:03:01.149 
it is you hold down the shift key and
the<00:02:58.730> option<00:02:59.090> key<00:02:59.269> that's<00:02:59.540> shift<00:02:59.989> and<00:03:00.230> the<00:03:00.620> Alt

00:03:01.149 --> 00:03:01.159 
the option key that's shift and the Alt

00:03:01.159 --> 00:03:03.339 
the option key that's shift and the Alt
key<00:03:01.280> on<00:03:01.459> a<00:03:01.609> PC<00:03:01.700> and<00:03:02.690> you<00:03:02.810> click<00:03:02.930> on<00:03:03.079> the<00:03:03.170> mask

00:03:03.339 --> 00:03:03.349 
key on a PC and you click on the mask

00:03:03.349 --> 00:03:05.319 
key on a PC and you click on the mask
thumbnail<00:03:03.590> and<00:03:04.040> as<00:03:04.190> you<00:03:04.280> can<00:03:04.400> see<00:03:04.430> I<00:03:04.790> have<00:03:05.000> the

00:03:05.319 --> 00:03:05.329 
thumbnail and as you can see I have the

00:03:05.329 --> 00:03:07.830 
thumbnail and as you can see I have the
red<00:03:05.480> overlay<00:03:05.870> that<00:03:06.379> shows<00:03:06.620> me<00:03:06.769> my<00:03:06.920> mask<00:03:07.159> and

00:03:07.830 --> 00:03:07.840 
red overlay that shows me my mask and

00:03:07.840 --> 00:03:12.190 
red overlay that shows me my mask and
it's<00:03:08.840> perfect<00:03:09.500> it<00:03:09.769> except<00:03:10.609> it's<00:03:11.109> masking<00:03:12.109> the

00:03:12.190 --> 00:03:12.200 
it's perfect it except it's masking the

00:03:12.200 --> 00:03:13.780 
it's perfect it except it's masking the
back<00:03:12.349> which<00:03:12.650> is<00:03:12.769> what<00:03:12.920> the<00:03:13.010> mask<00:03:13.159> is<00:03:13.340> doing<00:03:13.609> and

00:03:13.780 --> 00:03:13.790 
back which is what the mask is doing and

00:03:13.790 --> 00:03:16.869 
back which is what the mask is doing and
so<00:03:14.720> those<00:03:14.840> fibers<00:03:15.290> are<00:03:15.410> still<00:03:15.650> all<00:03:15.799> hidden<00:03:16.040> so

00:03:16.869 --> 00:03:16.879 
so those fibers are still all hidden so

00:03:16.879 --> 00:03:18.550 
so those fibers are still all hidden so
all<00:03:17.000> I<00:03:17.030> have<00:03:17.209> to<00:03:17.239> do<00:03:17.449> is<00:03:17.720> go<00:03:17.959> over<00:03:17.989> here<00:03:18.500> to

00:03:18.550 --> 00:03:18.560 
all I have to do is go over here to

00:03:18.560 --> 00:03:22.720 
all I have to do is go over here to
image<00:03:19.250> adjustments<00:03:20.680> convert<00:03:21.680> and<00:03:21.949> it

00:03:22.720 --> 00:03:22.730 
image adjustments convert and it

00:03:22.730 --> 00:03:24.460 
image adjustments convert and it
switches<00:03:22.970> it<00:03:23.209> around<00:03:23.419> and<00:03:23.690> now<00:03:23.870> I<00:03:23.900> can<00:03:24.169> see<00:03:24.349> my

00:03:24.460 --> 00:03:24.470 
switches it around and now I can see my

00:03:24.470 --> 00:03:27.909 
switches it around and now I can see my
fibers<00:03:24.889> really<00:03:25.549> well<00:03:26.230> so<00:03:27.230> all<00:03:27.260> I<00:03:27.440> have<00:03:27.620> to<00:03:27.650> do

00:03:27.909 --> 00:03:27.919 
fibers really well so all I have to do
