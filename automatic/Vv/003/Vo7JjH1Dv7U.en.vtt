00:04:11.210 --> 00:04:11.220 
then start doing your pump so now we

00:04:11.220 --> 00:04:13.970 
then start doing your pump so now we
have<00:04:11.250> dug<00:04:11.550> all<00:04:11.820> the<00:04:12.090> content<00:04:12.600> out<00:04:12.930> and<00:04:13.590> you

00:04:13.970 --> 00:04:13.980 
have dug all the content out and you

00:04:13.980 --> 00:04:16.760 
have dug all the content out and you

00:04:16.760 --> 00:04:16.770 
want to keep it as quite solid but you

00:04:16.770 --> 00:04:18.080 
want to keep it as quite solid but you
can<00:04:16.919> see<00:04:17.070> we've<00:04:17.250> done<00:04:17.370> a<00:04:17.400> very<00:04:17.609> good<00:04:17.730> clean

00:04:18.080 --> 00:04:18.090 
can see we've done a very good clean

00:04:18.090 --> 00:04:19.820 
can see we've done a very good clean
because<00:04:18.330> you<00:04:18.930> know<00:04:19.020> depending<00:04:19.410> on<00:04:19.530> the<00:04:19.590> size

00:04:19.820 --> 00:04:19.830 
because you know depending on the size

00:04:19.830 --> 00:04:21.500 
because you know depending on the size
of<00:04:19.950> the<00:04:20.039> pumpkin<00:04:20.489> you<00:04:20.850> need<00:04:21.060> to<00:04:21.210> keep<00:04:21.390> the

00:04:21.500 --> 00:04:21.510 
of the pumpkin you need to keep the

00:04:21.510 --> 00:04:23.480 
of the pumpkin you need to keep the
rigidity<00:04:22.080> of<00:04:22.109> the<00:04:22.440> pumpkin<00:04:22.890> so<00:04:23.130> it<00:04:23.190> doesn't

00:04:23.480 --> 00:04:23.490 
rigidity of the pumpkin so it doesn't

00:04:23.490 --> 00:04:23.940 
rigidity of the pumpkin so it doesn't
collapse

00:04:23.940 --> 00:04:23.950 
collapse

00:04:23.950 --> 00:04:25.620 
collapse
on<00:04:24.010> you<00:04:24.160> and<00:04:24.400> you<00:04:24.490> can<00:04:24.670> cut<00:04:24.880> a<00:04:24.910> good<00:04:25.180> eye<00:04:25.210> and<00:04:25.540> a

00:04:25.620 --> 00:04:25.630 
on you and you can cut a good eye and a

00:04:25.630 --> 00:04:28.050 
on you and you can cut a good eye and a
mouse<00:04:25.810> out<00:04:26.080> so<00:04:26.680> now<00:04:26.860> we're<00:04:27.490> going<00:04:27.580> to<00:04:27.640> put<00:04:27.700> this

00:04:28.050 --> 00:04:28.060 
mouse out so now we're going to put this

00:04:28.060 --> 00:04:31.440 
mouse out so now we're going to put this
away<00:04:28.540> and<00:04:29.520> we're<00:04:30.520> going<00:04:30.670> to<00:04:30.700> start<00:04:30.940> now<00:04:31.030> on

00:04:31.440 --> 00:04:31.450 
away and we're going to start now on

00:04:31.450 --> 00:04:34.950 
away and we're going to start now on
making<00:04:32.140> a<00:04:32.170> function<00:04:32.710> just<00:04:33.310> fast<00:04:33.580> as<00:04:33.970> we<00:04:34.690> said

00:04:34.950 --> 00:04:34.960 
making a function just fast as we said

00:04:34.960 --> 00:04:38.430 
making a function just fast as we said
Martin<00:04:35.710> the<00:04:36.400> little<00:04:36.730> dot<00:04:36.940> against<00:04:37.630> not<00:04:37.930> and

00:04:38.430 --> 00:04:38.440 
Martin the little dot against not and

00:04:38.440 --> 00:04:40.470 
Martin the little dot against not and
that<00:04:38.620> goes<00:04:38.800> back<00:04:39.070> in<00:04:39.250> on<00:04:39.370> the<00:04:39.490> lid<00:04:39.670> now<00:04:40.240> why<00:04:40.450> i

00:04:40.470 --> 00:04:40.480 
that goes back in on the lid now why i

00:04:40.480 --> 00:04:43.230 
that goes back in on the lid now why i
always<00:04:40.720> say<00:04:41.170> cut<00:04:41.890> the<00:04:42.010> lid<00:04:42.190> off<00:04:42.220> and<00:04:42.910> put<00:04:43.150> the

00:04:43.230 --> 00:04:43.240 
always say cut the lid off and put the

00:04:43.240 --> 00:04:44.640 
always say cut the lid off and put the
lid<00:04:43.360> back<00:04:43.390> on<00:04:43.600> because<00:04:43.960> you're<00:04:44.230> now<00:04:44.350> going<00:04:44.530> to

00:04:44.640 --> 00:04:44.650 
lid back on because you're now going to

00:04:44.650 --> 00:04:46.800 
lid back on because you're now going to
get<00:04:44.770> a<00:04:44.800> proportion<00:04:45.550> of<00:04:45.580> how<00:04:46.120> this<00:04:46.330> pumpkin

00:04:46.800 --> 00:04:46.810 
get a proportion of how this pumpkin

00:04:46.810 --> 00:04:51.300 
get a proportion of how this pumpkin
should<00:04:47.020> look<00:04:47.200> so<00:04:48.270> take<00:04:49.270> off<00:04:49.510> the<00:04:49.990> lid<00:04:50.170> and<00:04:50.980> find

00:04:51.300 --> 00:04:51.310 
should look so take off the lid and find

00:04:51.310 --> 00:04:54.210 
should look so take off the lid and find
out<00:04:51.520> how<00:04:51.730> deep<00:04:52.120> you<00:04:52.990> go<00:04:53.170> down<00:04:53.440> so<00:04:53.740> you<00:04:53.800> can<00:04:54.010> keep

00:04:54.210 --> 00:04:54.220 
out how deep you go down so you can keep

00:04:54.220 --> 00:04:55.830 
out how deep you go down so you can keep
them<00:04:54.370> out<00:04:54.550> away<00:04:54.880> from<00:04:54.910> the<00:04:55.210> bottom<00:04:55.570> so<00:04:55.810> that

00:04:55.830 --> 00:04:55.840 
them out away from the bottom so that

00:04:55.840 --> 00:04:57.360 
them out away from the bottom so that
the<00:04:56.080> light<00:04:56.260> can<00:04:56.500> come<00:04:56.650> through<00:04:56.830> the<00:04:56.950> mouth<00:04:57.130> Oh

00:04:57.360 --> 00:04:57.370 
the light can come through the mouth Oh

00:04:57.370 --> 00:04:59.400 
the light can come through the mouth Oh
cut<00:04:57.970> too<00:04:58.210> low<00:04:58.450> with<00:04:58.630> the<00:04:58.660> mouth<00:04:58.870> because<00:04:59.230> the
