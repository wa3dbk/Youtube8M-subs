00:02:05.850 --> 00:02:07.370 
easiest way into it for someone who who
doesn't<00:02:06.060> know<00:02:06.360> much<00:02:06.540> about<00:02:06.600> the<00:02:06.930> book<00:02:07.079> itself

00:02:07.370 --> 00:02:07.380 
doesn't know much about the book itself

00:02:07.380 --> 00:02:10.249 
doesn't know much about the book itself
certainly<00:02:08.099> Joyce<00:02:09.090> pointed<00:02:09.599> the<00:02:09.690> way<00:02:09.780> for<00:02:10.140> me

00:02:10.249 --> 00:02:10.259 
certainly Joyce pointed the way for me

00:02:10.259 --> 00:02:13.820 
certainly Joyce pointed the way for me
and<00:02:10.849> reading<00:02:11.849> Ulysses<00:02:12.420> when<00:02:12.780> I<00:02:12.810> was<00:02:12.989> 25<00:02:13.440> was

00:02:13.820 --> 00:02:13.830 
and reading Ulysses when I was 25 was

00:02:13.830 --> 00:02:14.180 
and reading Ulysses when I was 25 was
the

00:02:14.180 --> 00:02:14.190 
the

00:02:14.190 --> 00:02:19.370 
the
big<00:02:14.340> big<00:02:14.790> change<00:02:15.330> for<00:02:15.540> me<00:02:15.690> I<00:02:17.240> I<00:02:18.240> was<00:02:18.510> doing<00:02:19.320> a

00:02:19.370 --> 00:02:19.380 
big big change for me I I was doing a

00:02:19.380 --> 00:02:22.640 
big big change for me I I was doing a
read<00:02:19.500> dull<00:02:19.740> temp<00:02:20.130> job<00:02:20.400> and<00:02:20.700> I<00:02:21.060> thought<00:02:21.240> to<00:02:22.020> to

00:02:22.640 --> 00:02:22.650 
read dull temp job and I thought to to

00:02:22.650 --> 00:02:25.520 
read dull temp job and I thought to to
help<00:02:22.920> cope<00:02:23.820> with<00:02:23.850> it<00:02:24.150> I<00:02:24.360> would<00:02:24.480> read<00:02:25.080> Ulysses

00:02:25.520 --> 00:02:25.530 
help cope with it I would read Ulysses

00:02:25.530 --> 00:02:28.430 
help cope with it I would read Ulysses
which<00:02:25.710> I<00:02:25.920> hadn't<00:02:26.490> got<00:02:26.730> round<00:02:26.970> to<00:02:27.150> my<00:02:28.020> husband

00:02:28.430 --> 00:02:28.440 
which I hadn't got round to my husband

00:02:28.440 --> 00:02:31.970 
which I hadn't got round to my husband
it<00:02:28.710> was<00:02:29.130> my<00:02:29.310> first<00:02:29.490> reader<00:02:29.850> and<00:02:30.680> and<00:02:31.680> then<00:02:31.830> I

00:02:31.970 --> 00:02:31.980 
it was my first reader and and then I

00:02:31.980 --> 00:02:34.820 
it was my first reader and and then I
had<00:02:32.190> some<00:02:32.790> writer<00:02:33.060> friends<00:02:33.630> who<00:02:34.020> also<00:02:34.470> read<00:02:34.710> it

00:02:34.820 --> 00:02:34.830 
had some writer friends who also read it

00:02:34.830 --> 00:02:37.160 
had some writer friends who also read it
for<00:02:35.040> me<00:02:35.160> he<00:02:35.430> looked<00:02:36.120> a<00:02:36.150> bit<00:02:36.180> ashen-faced<00:02:36.930> when

00:02:37.160 --> 00:02:37.170 
for me he looked a bit ashen-faced when

00:02:37.170 --> 00:02:38.690 
for me he looked a bit ashen-faced when
I<00:02:37.200> first<00:02:37.500> asked<00:02:37.860> them<00:02:37.950> if<00:02:38.100> they<00:02:38.250> would<00:02:38.400> read

00:02:38.690 --> 00:02:38.700 
I first asked them if they would read

00:02:38.700 --> 00:02:42.170 
I first asked them if they would read
the<00:02:39.240> first<00:02:39.480> draft<00:02:39.830> but<00:02:40.830> then<00:02:41.580> read<00:02:41.820> it<00:02:41.850> and

00:02:42.170 --> 00:02:42.180 
the first draft but then read it and

00:02:42.180 --> 00:02:44.780 
the first draft but then read it and
much<00:02:43.080> relieved<00:02:43.440> to<00:02:43.800> discover<00:02:43.830> that<00:02:44.340> he<00:02:44.550> liked

00:02:44.780 --> 00:02:44.790 
much relieved to discover that he liked

00:02:44.790 --> 00:02:47.270 
much relieved to discover that he liked
it<00:02:45.000> and<00:02:45.570> but<00:02:46.110> they<00:02:46.260> mostly<00:02:46.590> just<00:02:46.650> said<00:02:47.040> keep

00:02:47.270 --> 00:02:47.280 
it and but they mostly just said keep

00:02:47.280 --> 00:02:50.420 
it and but they mostly just said keep
going<00:02:47.310> keep<00:02:47.760> going<00:02:47.790> keep<00:02:48.180> going<00:02:49.250> which<00:02:50.250> was

00:02:50.420 --> 00:02:50.430 
going keep going keep going which was

00:02:50.430 --> 00:02:51.830 
going keep going keep going which was
really<00:02:50.610> what<00:02:50.820> I<00:02:50.850> needed<00:02:51.150> at<00:02:51.420> that<00:02:51.450> point

00:02:51.830 --> 00:02:51.840 
really what I needed at that point

00:02:51.840 --> 00:02:53.960 
really what I needed at that point
because<00:02:52.110> I<00:02:52.500> had<00:02:52.650> so<00:02:52.800> little<00:02:52.830> confidence<00:02:53.520> and

00:02:53.960 --> 00:02:53.970 
because I had so little confidence and

00:02:53.970 --> 00:02:56.330 
because I had so little confidence and
what<00:02:54.060> I<00:02:54.090> was<00:02:54.240> doing<00:02:54.270> that<00:02:54.860> I<00:02:55.860> really<00:02:56.190> just

00:02:56.330 --> 00:02:56.340 
what I was doing that I really just

00:02:56.340 --> 00:02:59.000 
what I was doing that I really just
needed<00:02:56.700> someone<00:02:57.030> to<00:02:57.090> say<00:02:57.360> go<00:02:57.750> on<00:02:57.900> go<00:02:58.590> on

00:02:59.000 --> 00:02:59.010 
needed someone to say go on go on

00:02:59.010 --> 00:03:01.190 
needed someone to say go on go on
I<00:02:59.040> mean<00:02:59.400> I<00:02:59.490> wrote<00:02:59.700> the<00:02:59.970> story<00:03:00.030> in<00:03:00.630> a<00:03:00.660> completely

00:03:01.190 --> 00:03:01.200 
I mean I wrote the story in a completely

00:03:01.200 --> 00:03:03.500 
I mean I wrote the story in a completely
linear<00:03:01.890> way<00:03:02.250> and<00:03:02.610> I<00:03:02.670> didn't<00:03:02.970> know<00:03:03.150> how<00:03:03.450> the

00:03:03.500 --> 00:03:03.510 
linear way and I didn't know how the

00:03:03.510 --> 00:03:05.960 
linear way and I didn't know how the
book<00:03:03.870> would<00:03:04.050> end<00:03:04.260> until<00:03:04.890> about<00:03:05.490> 20<00:03:05.790> pages

00:03:05.960 --> 00:03:05.970 
book would end until about 20 pages

00:03:05.970 --> 00:03:09.170 
book would end until about 20 pages
before<00:03:06.540> the<00:03:06.720> end<00:03:07.040> and<00:03:08.040> it<00:03:08.190> took<00:03:08.370> me<00:03:08.610> six<00:03:09.090> months

00:03:09.170 --> 00:03:09.180 
before the end and it took me six months

00:03:09.180 --> 00:03:10.940 
before the end and it took me six months
I<00:03:09.450> did<00:03:09.600> three<00:03:09.750> drafts<00:03:09.990> in<00:03:10.230> six<00:03:10.440> months<00:03:10.770> and

00:03:10.940 --> 00:03:10.950 
I did three drafts in six months and

00:03:10.950 --> 00:03:14.630 
I did three drafts in six months and
