00:00:01.500 --> 00:00:04.040
 Hmm 

00:00:04.440 --> 00:00:07.130
 me 

00:00:30.570 --> 00:00:35.300
 This Hello everybody in Dealer 

00:00:34.020 --> 00:00:38.020
 Today is 

00:00:35.300 --> 00:00:39.790
 It is a place called Monday on the 1st 

00:00:38.020 --> 00:00:41.960
 Today's introduction 

00:00:39.790 --> 00:00:43.829
 First place 

00:00:41.960 --> 00:00:45.560
 This 

00:00:43.829 --> 00:00:48.150
 iphone 's 

00:00:45.560 --> 00:00:50.660
 If you look at the screen 

00:00:48.150 --> 00:00:53.400
 Here is a 

00:00:50.660 --> 00:00:54.730
 I would like to introduce you today 

00:00:53.400 --> 00:00:58.090
 it's here 

00:00:54.730 --> 00:01:01.900
 The Apple logo of the house is 

00:00:58.090 --> 00:01:08.110
 It's indecent language to include red come Romano 

00:01:01.900 --> 00:01:10.810
 The reason I wanted to introduce that indecent language this time is to Mr. 

00:01:08.110 --> 00:01:14.440
 The place is quite well received 

00:01:10.810 --> 00:01:19.000
 I bought it, so I wanted to introduce it this time 

00:01:14.440 --> 00:01:21.010
 I usually see the color of the apple, but one more thing 

00:01:19.000 --> 00:01:24.190
 Useful functions 

00:01:21.010 --> 00:01:25.880
 I have a look yesterday or something 

00:01:24.190 --> 00:01:28.820
 I think you put power 

00:01:25.880 --> 00:01:31.960
 This is always an action to the mud 

00:01:28.820 --> 00:01:31.960
 When the power is turned on 

00:01:32.440 --> 00:01:40.050
 This will also shine Different 

00:01:35.710 --> 00:01:40.050
 When I receive a recipe 

00:01:40.440 --> 00:01:44.900
 This also disappears 

00:01:42.420 --> 00:01:44.900
 flower 

00:01:45.090 --> 00:01:50.950
 Various built in LED panel inside 

00:01:48.570 --> 00:01:54.600
 It is defeated by connecting 

00:01:50.950 --> 00:01:54.600
 Electricity is turned on 

00:01:57.110 --> 00:02:01.280
 Please take a picture with Kamiya 

00:02:02.680 --> 00:02:07.200
 It has become this 

00:02:04.390 --> 00:02:10.440
 There is no prime minister even in taking a picture and a panel 

00:02:07.200 --> 00:02:12.770
 It was perfectly that I'm not a genuine model 

00:02:10.440 --> 00:02:12.770
 very well 

00:02:14.100 --> 00:02:22.310
 It is made in real 

00:02:16.370 --> 00:02:25.940
 I can draw the lower part of the letter but it's just a batter's duration 

00:02:22.310 --> 00:02:30.019
 I was worried about this time, so I did it only this time 

00:02:25.940 --> 00:02:32.960
 I think that I care about the battery, but the duration of the battery 

00:02:30.019 --> 00:02:34.710
 I use Rea's own rain 

00:02:32.960 --> 00:02:38.920
 I do not hear you 

00:02:34.710 --> 00:02:42.530
 I feel like such a change is not after you gave before bidding 

00:02:38.920 --> 00:02:43.910
 I 'm hitting this part of Chinami 

00:02:42.530 --> 00:02:49.060
 What is it 

00:02:43.910 --> 00:02:55.950
 In the shock of mobile phone paradise in Tokyo 

00:02:49.060 --> 00:02:59.340

00:02:55.950 --> 00:03:02.540

00:02:59.340 --> 00:03:05.270
 iphone 4s and iphone fassi 

00:03:02.540 --> 00:03:08.190
 That ad park panel is not attached though 

00:03:05.270 --> 00:03:11.380
 To you by chance of 

00:03:08.190 --> 00:03:12.910
 If you do not know how to put it on 

00:03:11.380 --> 00:03:16.620
 twitter or 

00:03:12.910 --> 00:03:16.620
 on facebook or youtube 

00:03:16.630 --> 00:03:27.400
 If that nail tweets or comments 

00:03:20.450 --> 00:03:30.659
 Since the answer is the sound of Thank you to Chinami is here bell on your own 

00:03:27.400 --> 00:03:30.659
 Did you make it an apple mark 

00:03:33.220 --> 00:03:39.810
 Normal things 

00:03:35.170 --> 00:03:39.810
 It is only with a single color 

00:03:42.150 --> 00:03:49.819
 Good friends Toka colleagues of Speaking 

00:03:45.920 --> 00:03:50.150
 It is said that it will also be the source of the story 

00:03:49.819 --> 00:03:52.390
 Yes 

00:03:50.150 --> 00:03:55.000
 Even my boss 

00:03:52.390 --> 00:03:57.620
 The point is that it is the source of the story 

00:03:55.000 --> 00:04:01.960
 There are quite a few good points 

00:03:57.620 --> 00:04:04.770
 I used this way on the train and I came to victory 

00:04:01.960 --> 00:04:04.770
 I think you worried 

00:04:06.050 --> 00:04:10.920

00:04:18.000 --> 00:04:22.479
