00:00:00.030 --> 00:00:05.250
 this song we are playing with the capo 

00:00:02.790 --> 00:00:07.309
 in the number two fret because that's the 

00:00:05.250 --> 00:00:10.169
 height at which the coffee tacuba sings 

00:00:07.309 --> 00:00:12.629
 but if we remove the capo and 

00:00:10.169 --> 00:00:15.209
 we play the same chords we will be 

00:00:12.629 --> 00:00:17.220
 at the height that the bunbury sings and that 

00:00:15.209 --> 00:00:19.020
 it's like it's the height at which the 

00:00:17.220 --> 00:00:20.640
 most of us can sing the 

00:00:19.020 --> 00:00:22.830
 let's divide to learn this 

00:00:20.640 --> 00:00:25.680
 song more easily let's divide 

00:00:22.830 --> 00:00:28.410
 the song in three parts the part of the 

00:00:25.680 --> 00:00:30.539
 introduction the part of the stanza and the 

00:00:28.410 --> 00:00:33.649
 part of the choir 

00:00:30.539 --> 00:00:36.629
 in the intro part we have a 

00:00:33.649 --> 00:00:40.040
 progression of three chords that is the 

00:00:36.629 --> 00:00:40.040
 typical jazz progression 

00:00:42.430 --> 00:00:47.500
 that progression is called 251 that in 

00:00:45.280 --> 00:00:49.830
 reality is nothing less than this 

00:00:47.500 --> 00:00:49.830
 correction 

00:00:50.560 --> 00:00:55.260
 but let's disguise it to give it a 

00:00:52.810 --> 00:00:58.900
 little more flavor to this introduction 

00:00:55.260 --> 00:01:01.560
 with some with some notes 

00:00:58.900 --> 00:01:01.560
 additional 

00:01:25.810 --> 00:01:28.810
 Y 

00:01:38.730 --> 00:01:43.050
 before learning the stanza part 

00:01:40.590 --> 00:01:45.290
 you must learn the bolero rhythm that 

00:01:43.050 --> 00:01:47.970
 is in the link that appears below 

00:01:45.290 --> 00:01:49.980
 If you already have it then we can 

00:01:47.970 --> 00:01:52.680
 continue there are some chords that you 

00:01:49.980 --> 00:01:54.810
 they play a compass in bolero time and 

00:01:52.680 --> 00:01:57.450
 Sometimes there are two chords that enter a 

00:01:54.810 --> 00:02:00.390
 only compass so we play half 

00:01:57.450 --> 00:02:02.010
 of compass each or the first four 

00:02:00.390 --> 00:02:05.370
 touch the first thing you have to do 

00:02:02.010 --> 00:02:08.840
 is to follow this progression as it is 

00:02:05.370 --> 00:02:08.840
 there playing bolero rhythm 

00:02:12.690 --> 00:02:15.690
 Y 

00:02:29.380 --> 00:02:32.380
 i 

00:02:34.530 --> 00:02:40.200
 now you are going to try this way you are going to 

00:02:37.110 --> 00:02:42.180
 play half a beat of bolero rhythm and 

00:02:40.200 --> 00:02:45.030
 the other medium with step will replace 

00:02:42.180 --> 00:02:49.459
 with an index and a half thumb arpeggio 

00:02:45.030 --> 00:02:49.459
 cancel and it will sound like this 

00:02:57.450 --> 00:03:00.450
 and 

00:03:08.830 --> 00:03:11.370
 Y 

00:03:15.170 --> 00:03:19.280
 the choir section is the most 

00:03:17.120 --> 00:03:21.380
 easy that there we play a compass in each 

00:03:19.280 --> 00:03:23.540
 chord of the progression we're also going to 

00:03:21.380 --> 00:03:25.610
 do the previous exercise but also 

00:03:23.540 --> 00:03:27.739
 you are going to do another 

00:03:25.610 --> 00:03:30.349
 exercise a compass not everything happens to 

00:03:27.739 --> 00:03:33.500
 bolero rhythm and the second beat with 

00:03:30.349 --> 00:03:38.090
 an arpeggio of eight index thumb notes and 

00:03:33.500 --> 00:03:40.120
 half ring finger thumb index 

00:03:38.090 --> 00:03:40.120
 index 

00:03:41.110 --> 00:03:46.470
 and there is the chick interspersed every two 

00:03:43.150 --> 00:03:46.470
 chords you're going to not like this 

00:03:55.239 --> 00:03:58.239
 Y 

00:03:59.650 --> 00:04:02.650
 ah 

00:04:09.200 --> 00:04:14.720
 ok and when you can do this exercise 

00:04:11.959 --> 00:04:16.989
 means that you can now put the 

00:04:14.720 --> 00:04:19.280
 arpeggios either in the middle of the compass or 

00:04:16.989 --> 00:04:20.930
 replace a complete compass for a 

00:04:19.280 --> 00:04:23.150
 arpeggio then they already have the elements 

00:04:20.930 --> 00:04:25.160
 necessary to be able to accompany 

00:04:23.150 --> 00:04:27.950
 success this song this song is
