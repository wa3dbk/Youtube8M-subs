00:00:41.390 --> 00:00:44.170
 after tonight's third win in three preseason games are from 

00:00:44.170 --> 00:00:45.650
 very good pre-season 

00:00:45.650 --> 00:00:46.690
 until now 

00:00:46.690 --> 00:00:48.200
 answer in its walls 

00:00:48.200 --> 00:00:51.400
 so good pre-season in addition to his game every time controlled 

00:00:51.400 --> 00:00:54.770
 the opponents of the news and working in emmaüs 

00:00:55.370 --> 00:00:58.800
 gold on the three games played for a good football with herschel course and 

00:00:58.800 --> 00:01:01.800
 different players so that's also very important 

00:01:02.400 --> 00:01:05.010
 but these last of the conference is basically enough about the dynamics of 

00:01:05.010 --> 00:01:06.220
 Last year 

00:01:06.220 --> 00:01:08.370
 but finally the integration of sis to 

00:01:08.370 --> 00:01:11.360
 to a week I think of preparing my new club 

00:01:11.360 --> 00:01:13.830
 at that level it also plays 

00:01:13.830 --> 00:01:16.950
 after the law that simonet who is so in the first minute been 

00:01:17.640 --> 00:01:19.660
 I was pretty balanced 

00:01:19.660 --> 00:01:21.700
 r to call him back 

00:01:21.700 --> 00:01:25.400
 a machine I do not know but in any case that's what made up until 

00:01:25.400 --> 00:01:27.660
 present is in the state of mind and quality at the level 

00:01:27.660 --> 00:01:29.580
 of the game in the physical impact 

00:01:29.580 --> 00:01:31.010
 it's really not bad 

00:01:31.010 --> 00:01:34.220
 the man in this low season start the year then the column in addition 

00:01:34.220 --> 00:01:38.300
 you take another role or in a group where when you have 800 bodies in 

00:01:38.300 --> 00:01:40.670
 as captain and leader of this team 

00:01:40.670 --> 00:01:42.100
 in fact the same role as 

00:01:42.100 --> 00:01:45.110
 the last college it's true we lost a little bit 

00:01:45.110 --> 00:01:48.490
 the two poles age level in the workforce so maybe more than 

00:01:48.490 --> 00:01:50.080
 responsibilities a little 

00:01:50.080 --> 00:01:53.340
 the yield on the no more than the price is already not bad she can alert 

00:01:53.340 --> 00:01:54.740
 not take a risk 

00:01:54.740 --> 00:01:57.790
 that what i do to prayssas everyone decides 

00:01:57.790 --> 00:02:00.850
 here it is to be a little more mature with the years that pass the group 

00:02:00.850 --> 00:02:01.820
 strongly sea 

00:02:01.820 --> 00:02:03.290
 live players 

00:02:03.290 --> 00:02:06.990
 a quarter of the experience so for me my role remains the same page each 

00:02:06.990 --> 00:02:10.500
 a little bit of we will become a little more mature we professional fine 

00:02:10.500 --> 00:02:11.729
 and to improve 

00:02:11.729 --> 00:02:14.619
 mine is the same for last year to many young men 

00:02:14.619 --> 00:02:17.379
 integrate the squad this season has yet others who have come all 

00:02:17.379 --> 00:02:20.279
 start from the gambardella where they are a little symbolized by them 

00:02:20.279 --> 00:02:23.009
 by rachid has limited the way they look at this new generation 

00:02:23.009 --> 00:02:24.599
 Nantes 

00:02:24.599 --> 00:02:26.730
 understand what you see in training 

00:02:26.730 --> 00:02:29.349
 it seems to be quality players and especially in good condition 

00:02:29.349 --> 00:02:33.040
 of spirit e on the ground and puyol in the group life of which aces and it is 

00:02:33.040 --> 00:02:37.790
 super important pedrosa will be hard to find it to scrounge for miles of 

00:02:37.790 --> 00:02:40.840
 playtime like could have done anthony was canceled the year 

00:02:40.840 --> 00:02:41.959
 latest 

00:02:41.959 --> 00:02:44.359
 beautiful and healthy nok 

00:02:44.359 --> 00:02:47.399
 here you are who attracts you the dump 

00:02:47.399 --> 00:02:51.029
 of annual wall ag points like angry the fed on the friendlies at 

00:02:51.029 --> 00:02:53.969
 training and that's mostly to have a great state of mind for 

00:02:53.969 --> 00:02:54.479
 see 

00:02:54.479 --> 00:02:58.139
 for me the small group because there are lessons to be learned from 

00:02:58.139 --> 00:02:59.119
 match tonight 

00:02:59.119 --> 00:03:02.209
 Here are people passionate series of victories is not to complain 

00:03:03.199 --> 00:03:05.829
 it's still a team that will evolve to a higher level in 

00:03:05.829 --> 00:03:07.589
 Africa 

00:03:07.589 --> 00:03:10.389
 here we are at this level already in terms of trust is something about 

00:03:10.389 --> 00:03:12.729
 which one can lean 

00:03:12.729 --> 00:03:15.769
 then will be in the game we see that good things offensively that 

00:03:15.769 --> 00:03:17.629
 defensively it stays 

00:03:17.629 --> 00:03:20.859
 it remains really consistent third match and third match without taking 

00:03:20.859 --> 00:03:22.029
 goal 

00:03:22.029 --> 00:03:25.469
 what does positive things cost after 

00:03:25.469 --> 00:03:28.219
 after that, there are still friendly matches that must be reflected in the competition 

00:03:28.219 --> 00:03:31.339
 we know that these years all the time anyway so that's the 

00:03:31.339 --> 00:03:32.729
 world the bag on the contrary 

00:03:32.729 --> 00:03:35.819
 this tempting second-half adjustment to the central defender position 

00:03:35.819 --> 00:03:38.819
 we have you a lot of defensive circles since your arrival at guingamp 

00:03:39.719 --> 00:03:42.309
 that's what we ask first are finally how you kill 

00:03:42.309 --> 00:03:44.309
 he followed this repositioning 

00:03:44.309 --> 00:03:47.439
 but by posing that direction the classroom where I have more benchmarks it is 

00:03:47.439 --> 00:03:48.929
 where I have always evolved 

00:03:48.929 --> 00:03:51.859
 now I had the opportunity to play a few francs central defense mandate 

00:03:51.859 --> 00:03:54.359
 last year it's a post where 

00:03:54.359 --> 00:03:57.669
 sometimes I missed a few landmarks but not framed in which I take 

00:03:57.669 --> 00:04:01.089
 still a lot of fun to m 

00:04:01.089 --> 00:04:04.329
 what is it that's not a concern for me to evolve because it's you 

00:04:04.329 --> 00:04:07.079
 who we talked to the coach that you can I stay this post where is it 

00:04:07.079 --> 00:04:07.409
 him 

00:04:07.409 --> 00:04:09.059
 even to reposition 

00:04:09.059 --> 00:04:10.199
 in central defense 

00:04:10.199 --> 00:04:12.649
 no no this point it's not me at least I'm the man with red hair 

00:04:12.649 --> 00:04:14.929
 newspapers 

00:04:14.929 --> 00:04:19.319
 I'm still not imposing anything like 100m in dance 

00:04:19.319 --> 00:04:22.389
 and had talked about it last year 

00:04:22.389 --> 00:04:25.039
 by the high school company 

00:04:25.039 --> 00:04:28.039
 at this post at the moment so there's no problem 

00:04:28.559 --> 00:04:30.069
 I do it with envy 

00:04:30.069 --> 00:04:33.699
 a word on 100 is the atmosphere in the group finally it will be transcribed his 

00:04:33.699 --> 00:04:34.870
 instrumentation that 

00:04:34.870 --> 00:04:38.630
 no matter who enters the mechanics is still so vivid always very 

00:04:38.630 --> 00:04:39.969
 very well 

00:04:39.969 --> 00:04:41.650
 defending the chance to be on the nymex 

00:04:41.650 --> 00:04:45.190
 I was lucky we did well we made the effort to go up we are on a 

00:04:45.190 --> 00:04:47.259
 very positive dynamic 

00:04:47.259 --> 00:04:50.229
 so those we see that feels that's all in these cases with a dynamic 

00:04:50.229 --> 00:04:53.080
 like that elsewhere 

00:04:53.080 --> 00:04:56.039
 it's always easier but in vain word that since I arrived here 

00:04:56.039 --> 00:04:56.710
 I have known 

00:04:56.710 --> 00:04:58.419
 the reverse spiral 

00:04:58.419 --> 00:05:00.349
 e the first two years I was there we were on a period 

00:05:00.349 --> 00:05:03.050
 exceptional cup of france we felt the club that even goes down 

00:05:03.050 --> 00:05:06.050
 this is something that is therefore inevitably 

00:05:06.569 --> 00:05:09.819
 necessarily it generates a lot of things in the equipped around 

00:05:10.779 --> 00:05:11.860
 which is positive 

00:05:11.860 --> 00:05:14.020
 he scored on this so I forgot to 

00:05:14.020 --> 00:05:16.599
 the euro it was a good exit at the end of last season is what was 

00:05:16.599 --> 00:05:17.509
 says in the press 

00:05:17.509 --> 00:05:22.779
 how% is unused season how do you see the season the situation here a 

00:05:22.779 --> 00:05:24.069
 how is it going for you 

00:05:24.069 --> 00:05:27.839
 not to win on moncoutié beginning of the season it's the fact not 

00:05:27.839 --> 00:05:30.839
 age I get ready as everyone goes to bed until I get ready 

00:05:31.979 --> 00:05:35.240
 well as it should be focusing on for the physical plant 

00:05:36.529 --> 00:05:39.529
 especially goes out after for me everyone asked the clearly 

00:05:40.210 --> 00:05:42.860
 to today and I think the French are also more 

00:05:42.860 --> 00:05:44.270
 believing 

00:05:44.270 --> 00:05:47.270
 I see myself I am 100% asking for 500% in the project 

00:05:47.819 --> 00:05:51.180
 his pregnant wife to the same year's scrapyard here I think so 

00:05:51.180 --> 00:05:53.370
 that here I have always been 

00:05:53.370 --> 00:05:56.370
 I have always been happy are more at risk in the club project 

00:05:57.020 --> 00:05:58.900
 as to the objectives set 

00:05:58.900 --> 00:06:01.900
 sarah this time three moves in contrast to guingamp but you are 

00:06:01.900 --> 00:06:03.819
 point I think more French 

00:06:03.819 --> 00:06:06.649
 that I make his commitments that elsewhere in fact we will win everything 

00:06:06.649 --> 00:06:09.649
 the parade will go thank you 

00:06:20.349 --> 00:06:20.379
