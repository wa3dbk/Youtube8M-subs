and<00:01:37.149> yeah<00:01:38.920> graphic<00:01:39.920> processor<00:01:40.579> this<00:01:40.789> is<00:01:40.909> where

00:01:41.080 --> 00:01:41.090 
and yeah graphic processor this is where

00:01:41.090 --> 00:01:44.830 
and yeah graphic processor this is where
you<00:01:41.209> want<00:01:41.359> to<00:01:41.450> go<00:01:41.569> to<00:01:42.369> it's<00:01:43.369> at<00:01:43.459> the<00:01:43.579> bottom<00:01:43.840> so

00:01:44.830 --> 00:01:44.840 
you want to go to it's at the bottom so

00:01:44.840 --> 00:01:47.559 
you want to go to it's at the bottom so
here<00:01:45.499> we<00:01:45.619> are<00:01:45.649> when<00:01:45.979> it's<00:01:46.130> plugged<00:01:46.399> in<00:01:46.639> I<00:01:46.939> put

00:01:47.559 --> 00:01:47.569 
here we are when it's plugged in I put

00:01:47.569 --> 00:01:50.949 
here we are when it's plugged in I put
it<00:01:47.659> in<00:01:47.779> max<00:01:48.560> performance<00:01:48.799> and<00:01:49.810> when<00:01:50.810> it's

00:01:50.949 --> 00:01:50.959 
it in max performance and when it's

00:01:50.959 --> 00:01:53.910 
it in max performance and when it's
unplugged<00:01:51.759> max<00:01:52.759> performance<00:01:52.969> still<00:01:53.479> and

00:01:53.910 --> 00:01:53.920 
unplugged max performance still and

00:01:53.920 --> 00:01:56.379 
unplugged max performance still and
that's<00:01:54.920> the<00:01:55.189> battery<00:01:55.520> setting<00:01:55.880> so<00:01:56.090> I<00:01:56.149> guess

00:01:56.379 --> 00:01:56.389 
that's the battery setting so I guess

00:01:56.389 --> 00:01:58.839 
that's the battery setting so I guess
that<00:01:57.020> you<00:01:57.079> could<00:01:57.229> set<00:01:57.380> it<00:01:57.409> up<00:01:57.590> to<00:01:57.770> there's<00:01:58.520> lots

00:01:58.839 --> 00:01:58.849 
that you could set it up to there's lots

00:01:58.849 --> 00:02:01.239 
that you could set it up to there's lots
of<00:01:58.969> options<00:01:59.359> you<00:01:59.389> can<00:01:59.599> put<00:02:00.349> put<00:02:00.740> it<00:02:00.829> through<00:02:00.920> so

00:02:01.239 --> 00:02:01.249 
of options you can put put it through so

00:02:01.249 --> 00:02:04.089 
of options you can put put it through so
yeah<00:02:01.659> so<00:02:02.659> I<00:02:02.689> would<00:02:02.749> X<00:02:03.049> I<00:02:03.200> this<00:02:03.259> and<00:02:03.619> the<00:02:03.950> next

00:02:04.089 --> 00:02:04.099 
yeah so I would X I this and the next

00:02:04.099 --> 00:02:09.449 
yeah so I would X I this and the next
thing<00:02:04.369> to<00:02:04.490> do<00:02:04.639> is<00:02:06.310> um<00:02:07.630> you<00:02:08.630> right-click<00:02:08.899> and

00:02:14.949 --> 00:02:14.959 
you go to the graphic properties there

00:02:14.959 --> 00:02:18.580 
you go to the graphic properties there
you<00:02:15.170> can<00:02:15.290> adjust<00:02:15.410> some<00:02:16.930> applications<00:02:17.930> and<00:02:18.230> on

quality<00:02:36.860> um<00:02:38.470> there's<00:02:39.470> three<00:02:39.920> options<00:02:40.280> for

00:02:40.300 --> 00:02:40.310 
quality um there's three options for

00:02:40.310 --> 00:02:48.400 
quality um there's three options for
texture<00:02:40.900> so<00:02:46.000> it's<00:02:47.000> performance<00:02:47.420> balance<00:02:48.260> and

00:02:48.400 --> 00:02:48.410 
texture so it's performance balance and

00:02:48.410 --> 00:02:51.820 
texture so it's performance balance and
quality<00:02:48.890> see<00:02:49.640> if<00:02:49.790> you<00:02:49.910> want<00:02:50.090> performance<00:02:50.830> you

00:02:51.820 --> 00:02:51.830 
quality see if you want performance you

00:02:51.830 --> 00:02:54.699 
quality see if you want performance you
can<00:02:51.980> click<00:02:52.160> on<00:02:52.280> there<00:02:52.489> and<00:02:52.540> I'm<00:02:53.540> doing<00:02:54.290> quality

00:02:54.699 --> 00:02:54.709 
can click on there and I'm doing quality

00:02:54.709 --> 00:02:55.930 
can click on there and I'm doing quality
because<00:02:54.950> I<00:02:55.100> want<00:02:55.310> the<00:02:55.370> highest<00:02:55.670> quality

00:02:55.930 --> 00:02:55.940 
because I want the highest quality

00:02:55.940 --> 00:02:57.550 
because I want the highest quality
possible--<00:02:56.180> and<00:02:56.660> since<00:02:56.900> everything<00:02:57.230> else<00:02:57.319> is

00:02:57.550 --> 00:02:57.560 
possible-- and since everything else is

00:02:57.560 --> 00:03:01.539 
possible-- and since everything else is
on<00:02:57.680> performance<00:02:58.310> it'll<00:02:59.180> be<00:02:59.239> okay<00:03:00.100> now

00:03:01.539 --> 00:03:01.549 
on performance it'll be okay now

00:03:01.549 --> 00:03:03.880 
on performance it'll be okay now
audio<00:03:01.940> traffic<00:03:02.330> filtering<00:03:02.810> I<00:03:03.019> put<00:03:03.680> it<00:03:03.769> on

00:03:03.880 --> 00:03:03.890 
audio traffic filtering I put it on

00:03:03.890 --> 00:03:08.979 
audio traffic filtering I put it on
eight<00:03:04.100> times<00:03:06.580> for<00:03:07.580> media<00:03:07.940> there's<00:03:08.660> all<00:03:08.840> these

00:03:08.979 --> 00:03:08.989 
eight times for media there's all these

00:03:08.989 --> 00:03:11.110 
eight times for media there's all these

can put it on performance or quality on

00:03:52.670 --> 00:03:54.819 
can put it on performance or quality on
the<00:03:52.850> side<00:03:53.120> I'm<00:03:53.870> not<00:03:54.109> sure<00:03:54.260> you<00:03:54.350> can<00:03:54.470> really<00:03:54.650> see

00:03:54.819 --> 00:03:54.829 
the side I'm not sure you can really see

00:03:54.829 --> 00:03:56.500 
the side I'm not sure you can really see
it<00:03:54.889> that<00:03:55.040> well<00:03:55.160> but<00:03:55.400> the<00:03:55.670> bottom<00:03:55.970> is<00:03:56.090> quality

00:03:56.500 --> 00:03:56.510 
it that well but the bottom is quality

00:03:56.510 --> 00:03:58.990 
it that well but the bottom is quality
and<00:03:56.889> the<00:03:57.889> lines<00:03:58.069> at<00:03:58.250> the<00:03:58.310> bottom<00:03:58.430> are<00:03:58.670> straight

00:03:58.990 --> 00:03:59.000 
and the lines at the bottom are straight

00:03:59.000 --> 00:04:00.729 
and the lines at the bottom are straight
and<00:03:59.180> up<00:03:59.329> here<00:03:59.569> it's<00:03:59.780> jagged<00:04:00.200> a<00:04:00.380> little<00:04:00.590> bit<00:04:00.680> at

00:04:00.729 --> 00:04:00.739 
and up here it's jagged a little bit at

00:04:00.739 --> 00:04:02.830 
and up here it's jagged a little bit at
the<00:04:00.829> bottom<00:04:00.950> so<00:04:01.579> yeah<00:04:01.880> I<00:04:01.910> put<00:04:02.180> it<00:04:02.269> on<00:04:02.359> quality

00:04:02.830 --> 00:04:02.840 
the bottom so yeah I put it on quality

00:04:02.840 --> 00:04:04.000 
the bottom so yeah I put it on quality
because<00:04:03.019> I<00:04:03.139> want<00:04:03.319> the<00:04:03.380> highest<00:04:03.709> quality

00:04:04.000 --> 00:04:04.010 
because I want the highest quality

00:04:04.010 --> 00:04:04.599 
because I want the highest quality
possible--

00:04:04.599 --> 00:04:04.609 
possible--

00:04:04.609 --> 00:04:06.789 
possible--
and<00:04:05.019> since<00:04:06.019> everything<00:04:06.319> else<00:04:06.440> is<00:04:06.680> on

00:04:06.789 --> 00:04:06.799 
and since everything else is on

00:04:06.799 --> 00:04:08.849 
and since everything else is on
performance<00:04:07.280> it'll<00:04:07.639> be<00:04:07.730> okay

00:04:08.849 --> 00:04:08.859 
performance it'll be okay

00:04:08.859 --> 00:04:12.449 
performance it'll be okay
now<00:04:09.859> I'm<00:04:10.190> gonna<00:04:10.340> go<00:04:10.430> to<00:04:10.489> manage<00:04:10.910> 3d<00:04:11.269> settings

00:04:12.449 --> 00:04:12.459 
now I'm gonna go to manage 3d settings

00:04:12.459 --> 00:04:15.039 
now I'm gonna go to manage 3d settings
and<00:04:13.459> I'm<00:04:13.880> going<00:04:14.000> to<00:04:14.060> edit<00:04:14.209> the<00:04:14.660> high

00:04:15.039 --> 00:04:15.049 
and I'm going to edit the high

00:04:15.049 --> 00:04:16.810 
and I'm going to edit the high
performance<00:04:15.500> and<00:04:15.680> video<00:04:15.889> processor<00:04:16.609> right

00:05:44.200 --> 00:05:44.210 
its global settings and I'm going to

00:05:44.210 --> 00:05:45.760 
its global settings and I'm going to
change<00:05:44.360> it<00:05:44.479> to<00:05:44.509> its<00:05:44.840> high<00:05:45.229> performance<00:05:45.289> and

00:05:45.760 --> 00:05:45.770 
change it to its high performance and

00:05:45.770 --> 00:05:49.240 
change it to its high performance and
video<00:05:46.009> graphics<00:05:46.400> card<00:05:46.810> there<00:05:47.810> we<00:05:47.900> go<00:05:48.080> now<00:05:49.069> it's

00:05:49.240 --> 00:05:49.250 
video graphics card there we go now it's

00:05:49.250 --> 00:05:53.920 
video graphics card there we go now it's
on<00:05:49.400> its<00:05:49.699> highest<00:05:50.629> possible<00:05:51.199> settings<00:05:52.930> and

00:05:53.920 --> 00:05:53.930 
on its highest possible settings and

00:05:53.930 --> 00:05:55.990 
on its highest possible settings and
well<00:05:54.770> you<00:05:54.949> can<00:05:55.069> edit<00:05:55.250> the<00:05:55.430> high<00:05:55.550> performance

00:05:55.990 --> 00:05:56.000 
well you can edit the high performance

00:05:56.000 --> 00:05:58.540 
well you can edit the high performance
too<00:05:56.689> so<00:05:57.050> yeah<00:05:57.379> the<00:05:57.560> global<00:05:57.919> settings<00:05:58.189> are<00:05:58.370> just

00:05:58.540 --> 00:05:58.550 
too so yeah the global settings are just

00:05:58.550 --> 00:05:59.110 
too so yeah the global settings are just
um

00:05:59.110 --> 00:05:59.120 
um

00:05:59.120 --> 00:06:01.350 
um
they're<00:05:59.569> already<00:05:59.689> one<00:05:59.990> the<00:06:00.229> ones<00:06:00.680> already<00:06:00.830> set

00:06:01.350 --> 00:06:01.360 
they're already one the ones already set

00:06:01.360 --> 00:06:06.730 
they're already one the ones already set
and<00:06:03.219> it's<00:06:04.219> the<00:06:04.400> default<00:06:04.759> I<00:06:04.939> guess<00:06:05.150> so<00:06:06.169> after

00:06:06.730 --> 00:06:06.740 
and it's the default I guess so after

00:06:06.740 --> 00:06:10.540 
and it's the default I guess so after
that<00:06:06.919> I<00:06:06.949> go<00:06:07.340> to<00:06:07.419> apply<00:06:08.419> at<00:06:08.599> the<00:06:08.719> bottom<00:06:09.550> and

00:06:10.540 --> 00:06:10.550 
that I go to apply at the bottom and

00:06:10.550 --> 00:06:13.779 
that I go to apply at the bottom and
you're<00:06:11.449> set<00:06:11.659> that<00:06:12.139> application<00:06:12.889> or<00:06:13.099> game<00:06:13.189> is

00:06:13.779 --> 00:06:13.789 
you're set that application or game is

00:06:13.789 --> 00:06:17.610 
you're set that application or game is
that<00:06:14.599> it's<00:06:14.810> Nvidia<00:06:15.500> graphics<00:06:15.650> card<00:06:16.069> now<00:06:16.219> and

00:06:17.610 --> 00:06:17.620 
that it's Nvidia graphics card now and

00:06:17.620 --> 00:06:18.969 
that it's Nvidia graphics card now and
yeah

00:06:18.969 --> 00:06:18.979 
yeah

00:06:18.979 --> 00:06:24.459 
yeah
I<00:06:19.300> guess<00:06:20.300> and<00:06:20.689> that's<00:06:21.110> it<00:06:22.930> that's<00:06:23.930> how<00:06:24.139> you<00:06:24.199> put

00:06:24.459 --> 00:06:24.469 
I guess and that's it that's how you put

00:06:24.469 --> 00:06:29.589 
I guess and that's it that's how you put
on<00:06:24.500> all<00:06:25.009> your<00:06:27.219> stats<00:06:28.219> on<00:06:28.610> maximum<00:06:29.419> performance

00:06:29.589 --> 00:06:29.599 
on all your stats on maximum performance

00:06:29.599 --> 00:06:31.990 
on all your stats on maximum performance
and<00:06:30.469> you<00:06:30.860> get<00:06:30.979> really<00:06:31.189> tight<00:06:31.400> with<00:06:31.580> it<00:06:31.699> and<00:06:31.819> see

00:06:31.990 --> 00:06:32.000 
and you get really tight with it and see

00:06:32.000 --> 00:06:34.390 
and you get really tight with it and see
