00:04:49.660 --> 00:04:49.670 
think there are there's doesn't need for

00:04:49.670 --> 00:04:52.810 
think there are there's doesn't need for
more<00:04:49.910> to<00:04:50.180> this<00:04:50.330> craft<00:04:51.010> what<00:04:52.010> I<00:04:52.040> feel<00:04:52.490> right<00:04:52.760> now

00:04:52.810 --> 00:04:52.820 
more to this craft what I feel right now

00:04:52.820 --> 00:04:55.420 
more to this craft what I feel right now
the<00:04:53.090> craftsmen<00:04:53.900> are<00:04:54.140> you<00:04:54.560> know<00:04:54.680> they<00:04:54.920> have<00:04:55.220> to

00:04:55.420 --> 00:04:55.430 
the craftsmen are you know they have to

00:04:55.430 --> 00:04:57.040 
the craftsmen are you know they have to
continue<00:04:55.910> with<00:04:56.030> their<00:04:56.210> traditional<00:04:56.750> crafts

00:04:57.040 --> 00:04:57.050 
continue with their traditional crafts

00:04:57.050 --> 00:04:58.810 
continue with their traditional crafts
and<00:04:57.320> their<00:04:57.440> traditional<00:04:58.040> designs<00:04:58.430> and<00:04:58.730> things

00:04:58.810 --> 00:04:58.820 
and their traditional designs and things

00:04:58.820 --> 00:05:01.630

like<00:04:59.060> that<00:04:59.120> but<00:04:59.900> to<00:05:00.230> the<00:05:00.470> modern<00:05:00.920> requirement

00:05:01.630 --> 00:05:01.640 
like that but to the modern requirement

00:05:01.640 --> 00:05:04.600 
like that but to the modern requirement
and<00:05:01.760> I<00:05:01.790> think<00:05:02.060> they<00:05:02.780> may<00:05:03.140> need<00:05:03.350> some<00:05:03.410> help<00:05:03.740> at
