should<00:03:24.630> be<00:03:24.720> about<00:03:24.810> 93<00:03:25.680> I<00:03:25.829> think<00:03:26.400> he<00:03:26.489> has<00:03:26.549> really

00:03:26.840 --> 00:03:26.850 
should be about 93 I think he has really

00:03:26.850 --> 00:03:28.520 
should be about 93 I think he has really
fast<00:03:27.030> acceleration<00:03:27.720> that's<00:03:27.930> why<00:03:28.079> he<00:03:28.319> just

00:03:28.520 --> 00:03:28.530 
fast acceleration that's why he just

00:03:28.530 --> 00:03:31.339 
fast acceleration that's why he just
seems<00:03:28.709> so<00:03:28.920> much<00:03:29.069> faster<00:03:29.420> 81<00:03:30.420> shot<00:03:30.720> in<00:03:30.870> 78
