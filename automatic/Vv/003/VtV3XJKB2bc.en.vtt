that when we tried to slide it back
together<00:02:03.500> we<00:02:03.860> noticed<00:02:04.099> the<00:02:04.250> bolts<00:02:04.520> that<00:02:04.579> go

00:02:04.719 --> 00:02:04.729 
together we noticed the bolts that go

00:02:04.729 --> 00:02:06.149 
together we noticed the bolts that go
through<00:02:04.909> the<00:02:04.970> floor<00:02:05.209> of<00:02:05.270> a<00:02:05.479> cargo<00:02:05.689> slide

interfere<00:02:07.159> with<00:02:07.310> the<00:02:07.369> bolts<00:02:07.640> that<00:02:07.729> we

00:02:07.809 --> 00:02:07.819 
interfere with the bolts that we

00:02:07.819 --> 00:02:10.089 
interfere with the bolts that we
installed<00:02:08.179> in<00:02:08.360> the<00:02:08.450> bed<00:02:08.660> so<00:02:09.590> we<00:02:09.709> had<00:02:09.920> to<00:02:09.979> take

00:02:10.089 --> 00:02:10.099 
installed in the bed so we had to take

00:02:10.099 --> 00:02:11.770 
installed in the bed so we had to take
out<00:02:10.280> two<00:02:10.489> bolts<00:02:10.910> and<00:02:11.000> go<00:02:11.269> ahead<00:02:11.480> and<00:02:11.599> shorten

00:02:11.770 --> 00:02:11.780 
out two bolts and go ahead and shorten

00:02:11.780 --> 00:02:13.750 
out two bolts and go ahead and shorten
them<00:02:12.019> provide<00:02:12.530> some<00:02:12.739> clearance<00:02:13.099> with<00:02:13.640> the

00:02:15.190 --> 00:02:15.200 
bolts shortened and reinstalled we'll go

00:02:15.200 --> 00:02:17.020 
bolts shortened and reinstalled we'll go
ahead<00:02:15.319> and<00:02:15.500> try<00:02:15.620> it<00:02:15.650> again<00:02:15.769> at<00:02:16.579> this<00:02:16.670> point<00:02:16.910> we
