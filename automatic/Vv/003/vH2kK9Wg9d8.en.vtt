welcome<00:00:01.230> to<00:00:01.319> Lucca<00:00:01.560> cubed<00:00:01.829> comms<00:00:03.230> tutorial<00:00:04.230> on

00:00:04.430 --> 00:00:04.440 
welcome to Lucca cubed comms tutorial on

00:00:04.440 --> 00:00:10.810 
welcome to Lucca cubed comms tutorial on
the<00:00:04.710> e<00:00:04.890> ll<00:00:05.629> CLL<00:00:06.830> last<00:00:07.830> layer<00:00:08.099> method<00:00:09.290> basically

00:00:10.810 --> 00:00:10.820 
the e ll CLL last layer method basically

00:00:10.820 --> 00:00:14.480 
the e ll CLL last layer method basically
what<00:00:11.820> you<00:00:11.969> do<00:00:12.179> with<00:00:12.480> this<00:00:12.599> method<00:00:13.080> is<00:00:13.490> solve

00:00:14.480 --> 00:00:14.490 
what you do with this method is solve

00:00:14.490 --> 00:00:19.279 
what you do with this method is solve
the<00:00:14.730> corners<00:00:15.120> first<00:00:16.369> then<00:00:17.750> the<00:00:18.750> last<00:00:19.080> layer

00:00:19.279 --> 00:00:19.289 
the corners first then the last layer

00:00:19.289 --> 00:00:20.750 
the corners first then the last layer
crossed<00:00:19.650> which<00:00:19.949> is<00:00:20.070> the<00:00:20.160> course<00:00:20.369> totally

00:00:20.750 --> 00:00:20.760 
crossed which is the course totally

00:00:20.760 --> 00:00:25.849 
crossed which is the course totally
opposite<00:00:21.180> then<00:00:21.740> the<00:00:22.910> olp<00:00:23.910> ll<00:00:24.240> method<00:00:24.680> so<00:00:25.680> this

00:00:25.849 --> 00:00:25.859 
opposite then the olp ll method so this

00:00:25.859 --> 00:00:28.359 
opposite then the olp ll method so this
is<00:00:26.039> kind<00:00:26.220> of<00:00:26.279> gotta<00:00:26.430> be<00:00:26.640> a<00:00:26.849> beginner<00:00:27.449> slash

00:00:28.359 --> 00:00:28.369 
is kind of gotta be a beginner slash

00:00:28.369 --> 00:00:30.769 
is kind of gotta be a beginner slash
intermediate<00:00:29.369> guide<00:00:29.640> and<00:00:30.000> the<00:00:30.240> reason<00:00:30.510> I<00:00:30.599> say

00:00:30.769 --> 00:00:30.779 
intermediate guide and the reason I say

00:00:30.779 --> 00:00:33.709 
intermediate guide and the reason I say
intermediate<00:00:31.650> is<00:00:32.219> because<00:00:32.790> there's<00:00:33.360> just<00:00:33.570> not

00:00:33.709 --> 00:00:33.719 
intermediate is because there's just not

00:00:33.719 --> 00:00:35.690 
intermediate is because there's just not
much<00:00:33.930> out<00:00:34.260> there<00:00:34.469> on<00:00:34.680> this<00:00:34.920> especially<00:00:35.219> video

00:00:35.690 --> 00:00:35.700 
much out there on this especially video

00:00:35.700 --> 00:00:40.420 
much out there on this especially video
tutorial<00:00:36.300> wise<00:00:37.070> so<00:00:38.070> the<00:00:38.579> very<00:00:38.790> first<00:00:39.059> step<00:00:39.420> is

00:00:40.420 --> 00:00:40.430 
tutorial wise so the very first step is

00:00:40.430 --> 00:00:44.750 
tutorial wise so the very first step is
to<00:00:41.430> make<00:00:41.579> sure<00:00:42.739> that<00:00:43.739> your<00:00:44.010> corners<00:00:44.460> are<00:00:44.640> in

00:00:44.750 --> 00:00:44.760 
to make sure that your corners are in

00:00:44.760 --> 00:00:50.060 
to make sure that your corners are in
the<00:00:44.850> right<00:00:45.000> place<00:00:48.110> okay<00:00:49.110> so<00:00:49.530> what<00:00:49.680> I<00:00:49.710> mean<00:00:49.920> by

00:00:50.060 --> 00:00:50.070 
the right place okay so what I mean by

00:00:50.070 --> 00:00:53.090 
the right place okay so what I mean by
that<00:00:50.250> is<00:00:51.170> you<00:00:52.170> know<00:00:52.260> normally<00:00:52.620> you'd<00:00:52.770> want<00:00:52.949> all

00:00:53.090 --> 00:00:53.100 
that is you know normally you'd want all

00:00:53.100 --> 00:00:56.869 
that is you know normally you'd want all
yellow<00:00:53.370> up<00:00:53.550> top<00:00:53.760> with<00:00:54.120> the<00:00:54.329> to<00:00:55.289> look<00:00:55.469> LLL<00:00:55.860> to<00:00:56.850> a

00:00:56.869 --> 00:00:56.879 
yellow up top with the to look LLL to a

00:00:56.879 --> 00:00:59.180 
yellow up top with the to look LLL to a
PLL<00:00:57.660> method<00:00:58.649> and<00:00:58.770> this<00:00:58.829> could<00:00:59.039> be<00:00:59.070> very

00:00:59.180 --> 00:00:59.190 
PLL method and this could be very

00:00:59.190 --> 00:01:01.130 
PLL method and this could be very
similar<00:00:59.640> as<00:00:59.910> far<00:01:00.000> as<00:01:00.270> you<00:01:00.420> know<00:01:00.539> about<00:01:00.840> for

00:01:01.130 --> 00:01:01.140 
similar as far as you know about for

00:01:01.140 --> 00:01:02.299 
similar as far as you know about for
meth<00:01:01.320> has<00:01:01.500> just<00:01:01.680> solved<00:01:01.859> the<00:01:01.890> whole<00:01:02.039> bottom

00:01:02.299 --> 00:01:02.309 
meth has just solved the whole bottom

00:01:02.309 --> 00:01:05.800 
meth has just solved the whole bottom
layer<00:01:02.520> but<00:01:03.270> this<00:01:03.390> is<00:01:03.510> more<00:01:03.660> difficult<00:01:03.809> because

00:01:05.800 --> 00:01:05.810 
layer but this is more difficult because

00:01:05.810 --> 00:01:07.700 
layer but this is more difficult because
normally<00:01:06.810> you're<00:01:06.900> just<00:01:07.020> looking<00:01:07.229> for<00:01:07.409> colors

00:01:07.700 --> 00:01:07.710 
normally you're just looking for colors

00:01:07.710 --> 00:01:09.770 
normally you're just looking for colors
but<00:01:08.520> now<00:01:08.670> you<00:01:08.729> want<00:01:09.119> to<00:01:09.210> make<00:01:09.330> sure<00:01:09.360> that

00:01:09.770 --> 00:01:09.780 
but now you want to make sure that

00:01:09.780 --> 00:01:13.969 
but now you want to make sure that
they're<00:01:09.960> also<00:01:11.510> oriented<00:01:12.510> correctly<00:01:12.830> so<00:01:13.830> let's

00:01:13.969 --> 00:01:13.979 
they're also oriented correctly so let's

00:01:13.979 --> 00:01:16.310 
they're also oriented correctly so let's
kind<00:01:14.189> of<00:01:14.220> start<00:01:14.340> with<00:01:14.700> the<00:01:14.970> you<00:01:15.930> know<00:01:16.049> find

00:01:16.310 --> 00:01:16.320 
kind of start with the you know find

00:01:16.320 --> 00:01:18.499 
kind of start with the you know find
your<00:01:16.439> first<00:01:16.590> two<00:01:16.830> set<00:01:17.040> of<00:01:17.130> colors<00:01:17.430> here<00:01:17.700> which

00:01:18.499 --> 00:01:18.509 
your first two set of colors here which

00:01:18.509 --> 00:01:21.890 
your first two set of colors here which
will<00:01:18.689> be<00:01:18.720> green<00:01:20.330> right<00:01:21.330> and<00:01:21.540> then<00:01:21.659> line<00:01:21.810> them

00:01:21.890 --> 00:01:21.900 
will be green right and then line them

00:01:21.900 --> 00:01:24.469 
will be green right and then line them
up<00:01:22.020> with<00:01:22.080> the<00:01:22.200> center<00:01:22.500> cube<00:01:22.860> and<00:01:23.369> again<00:01:24.030> this

00:01:24.469 --> 00:01:24.479 
up with the center cube and again this

00:01:24.479 --> 00:01:27.140 
up with the center cube and again this
is<00:01:24.950> don't<00:01:25.950> attempt<00:01:26.159> to<00:01:26.220> wash<00:01:26.430> this<00:01:26.670> unless<00:01:26.970> you

00:01:27.140 --> 00:01:27.150 
is don't attempt to wash this unless you

00:01:27.150 --> 00:01:31.039 
is don't attempt to wash this unless you
can<00:01:27.299> already<00:01:27.540> solve<00:01:27.780> a<00:01:27.930> cube<00:01:29.570> with<00:01:30.570> good<00:01:30.810> times

00:01:31.039 --> 00:01:31.049 
can already solve a cube with good times

00:01:31.049 --> 00:01:33.230 
can already solve a cube with good times
and<00:01:32.009> it<00:01:32.130> would<00:01:32.220> help<00:01:32.340> if<00:01:32.520> you're<00:01:32.670> to<00:01:32.790> do<00:01:32.909> the<00:01:33.030> to

00:01:33.230 --> 00:01:33.240 
and it would help if you're to do the to

00:01:33.240 --> 00:01:36.770 
and it would help if you're to do the to
look<00:01:33.479> P<00:01:33.780> lol<00:01:34.220> also<00:01:35.270> so<00:01:36.270> the<00:01:36.360> first<00:01:36.570> thing<00:01:36.689> you

00:01:36.770 --> 00:01:36.780 
look P lol also so the first thing you

00:01:36.780 --> 00:01:38.300 
look P lol also so the first thing you
want<00:01:36.930> to<00:01:36.960> do<00:01:37.049> is<00:01:37.200> get<00:01:37.350> these<00:01:37.439> corners<00:01:37.950> in<00:01:38.189> the

00:01:38.300 --> 00:01:38.310 
want to do is get these corners in the

00:01:38.310 --> 00:01:40.340 
want to do is get these corners in the
right<00:01:38.460> place<00:01:38.700> and<00:01:39.030> then<00:01:39.600> we're<00:01:39.780> gonna<00:01:39.900> flip

00:01:40.340 --> 00:01:40.350 
right place and then we're gonna flip

00:01:40.350 --> 00:01:43.730 
right place and then we're gonna flip
them<00:01:40.549> okay<00:01:41.549> a<00:01:41.579> orient<00:01:42.090> them<00:01:42.240> or<00:01:42.360> solve<00:01:42.630> them<00:01:42.869> so

00:01:43.730 --> 00:01:43.740 
them okay a orient them or solve them so

00:01:43.740 --> 00:01:45.740 
them okay a orient them or solve them so
we<00:01:44.130> know<00:01:44.280> this<00:01:44.520> is<00:01:44.579> in<00:01:44.820> the<00:01:44.909> wrong<00:01:45.060> place<00:01:45.240> this

00:01:45.740 --> 00:01:45.750 
we know this is in the wrong place this

00:01:45.750 --> 00:01:47.240 
we know this is in the wrong place this
is<00:01:45.930> in<00:01:46.020> the<00:01:46.079> wrong<00:01:46.229> place<00:01:46.409> obviously<00:01:46.979> these

00:01:47.240 --> 00:01:47.250 
is in the wrong place obviously these

00:01:47.250 --> 00:01:52.219 
is in the wrong place obviously these
two<00:01:47.490> need<00:01:47.670> to<00:01:47.700> be<00:01:47.850> swamped<00:01:50.149> but<00:01:51.149> these<00:01:51.930> are<00:01:52.170> in

00:01:52.219 --> 00:01:52.229 
two need to be swamped but these are in

00:01:52.229 --> 00:01:53.450 
two need to be swamped but these are in
the<00:01:52.290> right<00:01:52.439> place<00:01:52.710> even<00:01:52.979> though<00:01:53.100> this<00:01:53.220> one's

00:01:53.450 --> 00:01:53.460 
the right place even though this one's

00:01:53.460 --> 00:01:56.600 
the right place even though this one's
not<00:01:53.640> solved<00:01:54.200> but<00:01:55.200> first<00:01:55.530> before<00:01:55.770> we<00:01:55.950> solve<00:01:56.399> it

00:01:56.600 --> 00:01:56.610 
not solved but first before we solve it

00:01:56.610 --> 00:02:00.630 
not solved but first before we solve it
we<00:01:57.600> want<00:01:57.780> to<00:01:57.869> flip<00:01:58.110> these<00:01:58.259> two<00:01:58.729> so

00:02:00.630 --> 00:02:00.640 
we want to flip these two so

00:02:00.640 --> 00:02:02.250 
we want to flip these two so
go<00:02:00.730> ahead<00:02:00.880> and<00:02:01.030> take<00:02:01.840> a<00:02:01.870> look<00:02:02.020> at<00:02:02.170> this

00:02:02.250 --> 00:02:02.260 
go ahead and take a look at this

00:02:02.260 --> 00:02:05.670 
go ahead and take a look at this
algorithm<00:02:02.830> and<00:02:03.790> also<00:02:04.480> I'll<00:02:05.140> be<00:02:05.170> having<00:02:05.560> at

00:02:05.670 --> 00:02:05.680 
algorithm and also I'll be having at

00:02:05.680 --> 00:02:09.870 
algorithm and also I'll be having at
Luba<00:02:06.010> cube<00:02:06.250> comm<00:02:06.820> a<00:02:08.130> tutorial<00:02:09.130> and<00:02:09.700> also

00:02:09.870 --> 00:02:09.880 
Luba cube comm a tutorial and also

00:02:09.880 --> 00:02:11.880 
Luba cube comm a tutorial and also
hopefully<00:02:10.690> be<00:02:10.960> able<00:02:11.050> to<00:02:11.140> get<00:02:11.260> the<00:02:11.380> notations

00:02:11.880 --> 00:02:11.890 
hopefully be able to get the notations

00:02:11.890 --> 00:02:15.210 
hopefully be able to get the notations
up<00:02:12.070> on<00:02:12.250> there<00:02:12.430> soon<00:02:12.700> also<00:02:13.300> so<00:02:13.980> this<00:02:14.980> is<00:02:15.100> gonna

00:02:15.210 --> 00:02:15.220 
up on there soon also so this is gonna

00:02:15.220 --> 00:02:18.120 
up on there soon also so this is gonna
be<00:02:15.310> your<00:02:15.460> starting<00:02:15.790> face<00:02:16.710> because<00:02:17.710> this<00:02:17.860> sides

00:02:18.120 --> 00:02:18.130 
be your starting face because this sides

00:02:18.130 --> 00:02:19.590 
be your starting face because this sides
already<00:02:18.460> solved<00:02:18.820> so<00:02:18.940> we<00:02:19.000> put<00:02:19.180> this<00:02:19.270> face

00:02:19.590 --> 00:02:19.600 
already solved so we put this face

00:02:19.600 --> 00:02:21.120 
already solved so we put this face
that's<00:02:19.900> not<00:02:19.990> solved<00:02:20.500> in<00:02:20.590> front<00:02:20.800> of<00:02:20.860> us<00:02:20.980> and

00:02:21.120 --> 00:02:21.130 
that's not solved in front of us and

00:02:21.130 --> 00:02:41.860 
that's not solved in front of us and
this<00:02:21.220> is<00:02:21.280> what<00:02:21.400> we<00:02:21.490> do

00:02:41.860 --> 00:02:41.870 

00:02:41.870 --> 00:02:45.430 

didn't<00:02:42.440> rotate<00:02:42.740> this<00:02:42.860> to<00:02:42.920> us

00:02:45.430 --> 00:02:45.440 

00:02:45.440 --> 00:02:46.980 

okay

00:02:46.980 --> 00:02:46.990 
okay

00:02:46.990 --> 00:02:52.830 
okay
so<00:02:47.680> now<00:02:48.010> we<00:02:48.070> see<00:02:51.120> this<00:02:52.120> is<00:02:52.270> in<00:02:52.420> the<00:02:52.540> right<00:02:52.690> place

00:02:52.830 --> 00:02:52.840 
so now we see this is in the right place

00:02:52.840 --> 00:02:55.500 
so now we see this is in the right place
even<00:02:53.290> though<00:02:53.410> it's<00:02:53.500> got<00:02:53.620> to<00:02:53.740> be<00:02:53.860> solved<00:02:54.510> this

00:02:55.500 --> 00:02:55.510 
even though it's got to be solved this

00:02:55.510 --> 00:02:56.850 
even though it's got to be solved this
is<00:02:55.660> in<00:02:55.780> the<00:02:55.870> right<00:02:55.990> place<00:02:56.170> even<00:02:56.650> though<00:02:56.740> it's

00:02:56.850 --> 00:02:56.860 
is in the right place even though it's

00:02:56.860 --> 00:02:58.860 
is in the right place even though it's
got<00:02:56.950> to<00:02:57.100> be<00:02:57.160> solved<00:02:57.610> this<00:02:58.360> is<00:02:58.540> in<00:02:58.660> the<00:02:58.720> right

00:02:58.860 --> 00:02:58.870 
got to be solved this is in the right

00:02:58.870 --> 00:03:00.270 
got to be solved this is in the right
place<00:02:59.020> even<00:02:59.350> though<00:02:59.470> it's<00:02:59.560> got<00:02:59.650> to<00:02:59.770> be<00:02:59.860> solved

00:03:00.270 --> 00:03:00.280 
place even though it's got to be solved

00:03:00.280 --> 00:03:02.030 
place even though it's got to be solved
and<00:03:00.520> this<00:03:00.640> is<00:03:00.820> solved<00:03:01.150> in<00:03:01.240> in<00:03:01.390> the<00:03:01.480> right<00:03:01.630> place

00:03:02.030 --> 00:03:02.040 
and this is solved in in the right place

00:03:02.040 --> 00:03:05.280 
and this is solved in in the right place
let's<00:03:03.040> say<00:03:03.220> you<00:03:03.280> have<00:03:03.550> you<00:03:04.540> know<00:03:04.660> how<00:03:04.810> we<00:03:05.110> had

00:03:05.280 --> 00:03:05.290 
let's say you have you know how we had

00:03:05.290 --> 00:03:06.540 
let's say you have you know how we had
these<00:03:05.440> two<00:03:05.500> already<00:03:05.980> in<00:03:06.070> the<00:03:06.160> right<00:03:06.310> place

00:03:06.540 --> 00:03:06.550 
these two already in the right place

00:03:06.550 --> 00:03:08.310 
these two already in the right place
even<00:03:06.790> though<00:03:06.910> they're<00:03:07.060> not<00:03:07.090> solved<00:03:07.600> and<00:03:08.290> we

00:03:08.310 --> 00:03:08.320 
even though they're not solved and we

00:03:08.320 --> 00:03:10.410 
even though they're not solved and we
just<00:03:08.590> switched<00:03:08.830> these<00:03:09.100> two<00:03:09.340> let's<00:03:10.120> say<00:03:10.210> that

00:03:10.410 --> 00:03:10.420 
just switched these two let's say that

00:03:10.420 --> 00:03:12.420 
just switched these two let's say that
she<00:03:10.510> had<00:03:10.600> all<00:03:10.750> four<00:03:11.050> them<00:03:11.320> in<00:03:11.860> the<00:03:11.980> wrong<00:03:12.130> place

00:03:12.420 --> 00:03:12.430 
she had all four them in the wrong place

00:03:12.430 --> 00:03:14.760 
she had all four them in the wrong place
this<00:03:13.000> is<00:03:13.180> what<00:03:13.300> you<00:03:13.480> do<00:03:13.720> give<00:03:14.050> me<00:03:14.080> one<00:03:14.290> second

00:03:14.760 --> 00:03:14.770 
this is what you do give me one second

00:03:14.770 --> 00:03:20.520 
this is what you do give me one second
and<00:03:15.690> let<00:03:16.690> me<00:03:16.810> set<00:03:16.960> it<00:03:17.020> up<00:03:17.200> here<00:03:19.350> most<00:03:20.350> of<00:03:20.470> you

00:03:20.520 --> 00:03:20.530 
and let me set it up here most of you

00:03:20.530 --> 00:03:23.790 
and let me set it up here most of you
already<00:03:20.740> know<00:03:20.920> this<00:03:21.250> algorithm<00:03:22.620> okay

00:03:23.790 --> 00:03:23.800 
already know this algorithm okay

00:03:23.800 --> 00:03:30.150 
already know this algorithm okay
see

00:03:30.150 --> 00:03:30.160 

00:03:30.160 --> 00:03:33.420 

these<00:03:30.820> need<00:03:31.030> to<00:03:31.060> be<00:03:31.120> swamped<00:03:31.770> in<00:03:32.770> these<00:03:33.160> need

00:03:33.420 --> 00:03:33.430 
these need to be swamped in these need

00:03:33.430 --> 00:03:38.250 
these need to be swamped in these need
to<00:03:33.460> be<00:03:33.550> swamped<00:03:34.030> so<00:03:36.420> you<00:03:37.420> find<00:03:37.720> two<00:03:37.930> colors

00:03:38.250 --> 00:03:38.260 
to be swamped so you find two colors

00:03:38.260 --> 00:03:40.560 
to be swamped so you find two colors
that<00:03:38.440> match<00:03:38.620> let's<00:03:39.250> use<00:03:39.730> green<00:03:39.940> that<00:03:40.480> are

00:03:40.560 --> 00:03:40.570 
that match let's use green that are

00:03:40.570 --> 00:03:41.730 
that match let's use green that are
right<00:03:40.690> next<00:03:40.810> to<00:03:40.960> each<00:03:41.080> other<00:03:41.230> and<00:03:41.410> line<00:03:41.560> them

00:03:41.730 --> 00:03:41.740 
right next to each other and line them

00:03:41.740 --> 00:03:44.130 
right next to each other and line them
up<00:03:41.800> with<00:03:41.860> the<00:03:42.100> green<00:03:42.400> face<00:03:42.700> and<00:03:43.210> then<00:03:43.930> you<00:03:44.020> know

00:03:44.130 --> 00:03:44.140 
up with the green face and then you know

00:03:44.140 --> 00:03:47.910 
up with the green face and then you know
these<00:03:44.350> need<00:03:44.650> to<00:03:44.680> be<00:03:44.770> swapped<00:03:46.590> and<00:03:47.590> then<00:03:47.740> also

00:03:47.910 --> 00:03:47.920 
these need to be swapped and then also

00:03:47.920 --> 00:03:50.850 
these need to be swapped and then also
you<00:03:48.130> look<00:03:48.250> at<00:03:48.400> the<00:03:48.520> back<00:03:49.000> face<00:03:49.330> so<00:03:49.960> this<00:03:50.560> is<00:03:50.740> the

00:03:50.850 --> 00:03:50.860 
you look at the back face so this is the

00:03:50.860 --> 00:03:53.130 
you look at the back face so this is the
set<00:03:51.070> you<00:03:51.190> picked<00:03:51.370> out<00:03:51.630> and<00:03:52.630> you<00:03:52.720> turn<00:03:52.960> to<00:03:52.990> the

00:03:53.130 --> 00:03:53.140 
set you picked out and you turn to the

00:03:53.140 --> 00:03:54.990 
set you picked out and you turn to the
back<00:03:53.320> face<00:03:53.620> and<00:03:54.010> see<00:03:54.190> if<00:03:54.250> it's<00:03:54.400> already<00:03:54.640> solved

00:03:54.990 --> 00:03:55.000 
back face and see if it's already solved

00:03:55.000 --> 00:03:57.750 
back face and see if it's already solved
also<00:03:55.360> which<00:03:55.600> eyes<00:03:56.590> just<00:03:56.830> give<00:03:57.010> me<00:03:57.130> P<00:03:57.430> muted<00:03:57.700> I

00:03:57.750 --> 00:03:57.760 
also which eyes just give me P muted I

00:03:57.760 --> 00:03:59.970 
also which eyes just give me P muted I
should<00:03:57.970> say<00:03:58.350> which<00:03:59.350> these<00:03:59.530> need<00:03:59.800> to<00:03:59.890> be

00:03:59.970 --> 00:03:59.980 
should say which these need to be

00:03:59.980 --> 00:04:03.720 
should say which these need to be
flipped<00:04:00.190> also<00:04:00.990> the<00:04:01.990> REA<00:04:02.200> you<00:04:02.260> Duman<00:04:02.800> too<00:04:03.070> and

00:04:03.720 --> 00:04:03.730 
flipped also the REA you Duman too and

00:04:03.730 --> 00:04:05.730 
flipped also the REA you Duman too and
you<00:04:03.820> can<00:04:03.910> start<00:04:04.090> with<00:04:04.240> this<00:04:04.330> face<00:04:04.570> or<00:04:05.350> if<00:04:05.530> this

00:04:05.730 --> 00:04:05.740 
you can start with this face or if this

00:04:05.740 --> 00:04:07.830 
you can start with this face or if this
face<00:04:06.010> doesn't<00:04:06.190> matter<00:04:06.520> we're<00:04:07.510> not<00:04:07.630> going<00:04:07.780> to

00:04:07.830 --> 00:04:07.840 
face doesn't matter we're not going to

00:04:07.840 --> 00:04:09.420 
face doesn't matter we're not going to
use<00:04:07.990> this<00:04:08.170> face<00:04:08.410> remember<00:04:09.040> because<00:04:09.220> this

00:04:09.420 --> 00:04:09.430 
use this face remember because this

00:04:09.430 --> 00:04:27.180 
use this face remember because this
isn't<00:04:09.730> our<00:04:09.820> set<00:04:10.680> gotta<00:04:11.680> go

00:04:27.180 --> 00:04:27.190 

00:04:27.190 --> 00:04:30.630 

okay<00:04:27.820> now<00:04:28.750> this<00:04:28.900> is<00:04:28.960> in<00:04:29.170> the<00:04:29.200> right<00:04:29.350> place<00:04:29.640> this

00:04:30.630 --> 00:04:30.640 
okay now this is in the right place this

00:04:30.640 --> 00:04:31.850 
okay now this is in the right place this
is<00:04:30.700> in<00:04:30.910> the<00:04:31.000> right<00:04:31.150> place

00:04:31.850 --> 00:04:31.860 
is in the right place

00:04:31.860 --> 00:04:34.500 
is in the right place
this<00:04:32.860> is<00:04:33.010> in<00:04:33.100> the<00:04:33.160> right<00:04:33.250> place<00:04:33.430> this<00:04:34.180> is<00:04:34.360> in

00:04:34.500 --> 00:04:34.510 
this is in the right place this is in

this is in the right place this is in
the<00:04:34.570> right<00:04:34.720> place<00:04:35.130> our<00:04:36.130> next<00:04:36.370> video<00:04:36.610> will<00:04:36.790> talk

00:04:36.810 --> 00:04:36.820 
the right place our next video will talk

00:04:36.820 --> 00:04:40.850 
the right place our next video will talk
about<00:04:37.210> putting<00:04:37.600> all<00:04:37.750> the<00:04:38.290> yellow<00:04:38.710> about<00:04:39.460> top

00:04:40.850 --> 00:04:40.860 
about putting all the yellow about top

00:04:40.860 --> 00:04:43.440 
about putting all the yellow about top
with<00:04:41.860> one<00:04:42.100> algorithm<00:04:42.430> then<00:04:42.970> the<00:04:43.060> last<00:04:43.240> video

00:04:43.440 --> 00:04:43.450 
with one algorithm then the last video

00:04:43.450 --> 00:04:47.880 
with one algorithm then the last video
will<00:04:43.630> be<00:04:44.080> the<00:04:44.110> cross<00:04:46.500> so<00:04:47.500> some<00:04:47.710> of<00:04:47.800> these

00:04:47.880 --> 00:04:47.890 
will be the cross so some of these

00:04:47.890 --> 00:04:49.170 
will be the cross so some of these
algorithms<00:04:48.220> I'm<00:04:48.550> going<00:04:48.670> to<00:04:48.730> show<00:04:48.850> you<00:04:48.880> in<00:04:49.120> the

00:04:49.170 --> 00:04:49.180 
algorithms I'm going to show you in the

00:04:49.180 --> 00:04:54.690 
algorithms I'm going to show you in the
next<00:04:49.210> videos<00:04:50.010> will<00:04:52.950> disturb<00:04:53.950> the<00:04:54.160> cross<00:04:54.400> but

00:04:54.690 --> 00:04:54.700 
next videos will disturb the cross but

00:04:54.700 --> 00:04:57.390 
next videos will disturb the cross but
again<00:04:54.940> that<00:04:55.090> doesn't<00:04:55.120> matter<00:04:55.570> at<00:04:55.840> all<00:04:56.400> okay

00:04:57.390 --> 00:04:57.400 
again that doesn't matter at all okay

00:04:57.400 --> 00:04:59.580 
again that doesn't matter at all okay
because<00:04:58.150> we<00:04:58.750> don't<00:04:58.900> sold<00:04:59.080> the<00:04:59.140> cross<00:04:59.350> to<00:04:59.560> the

00:04:59.580 --> 00:04:59.590 
because we don't sold the cross to the

00:04:59.590 --> 00:05:01.050 
because we don't sold the cross to the
very<00:04:59.860> end<00:05:00.100> we<00:05:00.250> don't<00:05:00.340> even<00:05:00.610> bother<00:05:00.790> getting

00:05:01.050 --> 00:05:01.060 
very end we don't even bother getting

00:05:01.060 --> 00:05:04.170 
very end we don't even bother getting
the<00:05:01.210> yellow<00:05:01.390> up<00:05:01.600> top<00:05:01.810> okay<00:05:02.680> so<00:05:03.550> not<00:05:03.970> to<00:05:04.090> the

00:05:04.170 --> 00:05:04.180 
the yellow up top okay so not to the

00:05:04.180 --> 00:05:06.540 
the yellow up top okay so not to the
very<00:05:04.390> end<00:05:04.660> a<00:05:04.900> lot<00:05:05.290> of<00:05:05.380> these<00:05:05.440> algorithms<00:05:05.770> you

00:05:06.540 --> 00:05:06.550 
very end a lot of these algorithms you

00:05:06.550 --> 00:05:08.250 
very end a lot of these algorithms you
will<00:05:06.700> already<00:05:06.910> know<00:05:07.000> and<00:05:07.960> all<00:05:08.080> of<00:05:08.170> these

00:05:08.250 --> 00:05:08.260 
will already know and all of these

00:05:08.260 --> 00:05:09.990 
will already know and all of these
scenarios<00:05:08.470> will<00:05:08.920> also<00:05:09.160> look<00:05:09.310> familiar<00:05:09.520> but

00:05:09.990 --> 00:05:10.000 
scenarios will also look familiar but

00:05:10.000 --> 00:05:11.970 
scenarios will also look familiar but
there'll<00:05:10.180> be<00:05:10.210> different<00:05:10.570> algorithms<00:05:11.320> because

00:05:11.970 --> 00:05:11.980 
there'll be different algorithms because

00:05:11.980 --> 00:05:13.620 
there'll be different algorithms because
we<00:05:12.100> don't<00:05:12.250> want<00:05:12.370> to<00:05:12.430> mess<00:05:12.550> up<00:05:12.730> the<00:05:12.850> orientation

00:05:13.620 --> 00:05:13.630 
we don't want to mess up the orientation

00:05:13.630 --> 00:05:16.950 
we don't want to mess up the orientation
of<00:05:14.460> these<00:05:15.460> once<00:05:15.970> we<00:05:16.150> go<00:05:16.270> to<00:05:16.330> the<00:05:16.540> last<00:05:16.750> layer

00:05:16.950 --> 00:05:16.960 
of these once we go to the last layer

00:05:16.960 --> 00:05:18.360 
of these once we go to the last layer
cross<00:05:17.290> and<00:05:17.590> again<00:05:17.770> I'm<00:05:17.860> talking<00:05:17.890> about<00:05:18.160> the

00:05:18.360 --> 00:05:18.370 
cross and again I'm talking about the

00:05:18.370 --> 00:05:22.280 
cross and again I'm talking about the
next<00:05:19.150> two<00:05:19.300> videos<00:05:19.450> that<00:05:19.630> you'll<00:05:19.990> see<00:05:20.170> so<00:05:21.150> again

00:05:22.280 --> 00:05:22.290 
next two videos that you'll see so again

00:05:22.290 --> 00:05:24.990 
next two videos that you'll see so again
what<00:05:23.290> you<00:05:23.320> want<00:05:23.590> to<00:05:23.680> do<00:05:23.860> for<00:05:24.460> the<00:05:24.580> first<00:05:24.730> step

00:05:24.990 --> 00:05:25.000 
what you want to do for the first step

00:05:25.000 --> 00:05:29.820 
what you want to do for the first step
of<00:05:25.120> the<00:05:25.180> II<00:05:25.240> LLC<00:05:25.660> ll<00:05:26.560> aka<00:05:27.450> CLL<00:05:28.480> DLL<00:05:29.470> you<00:05:29.710> know

00:05:29.820 --> 00:05:29.830 
of the II LLC ll aka CLL DLL you know

00:05:29.830 --> 00:05:33.950 
of the II LLC ll aka CLL DLL you know
which<00:05:30.220> is<00:05:31.050> corners<00:05:32.050> first<00:05:32.460> edges<00:05:33.460> the<00:05:33.580> last

00:05:33.950 --> 00:05:33.960 
which is corners first edges the last

00:05:33.960 --> 00:05:36.720 
which is corners first edges the last
method<00:05:34.960> is<00:05:35.290> you<00:05:35.980> want<00:05:36.160> to<00:05:36.250> pick<00:05:36.400> a<00:05:36.430> set<00:05:36.640> of

00:05:36.720 --> 00:05:36.730 
method is you want to pick a set of

00:05:36.730 --> 00:05:40.620 
method is you want to pick a set of
colors<00:05:37.060> let's<00:05:37.780> see<00:05:38.050> blue<00:05:39.240> and<00:05:40.240> you<00:05:40.390> want<00:05:40.540> to

00:05:40.620 --> 00:05:40.630 
colors let's see blue and you want to

00:05:40.630 --> 00:05:43.170 
colors let's see blue and you want to
put<00:05:40.810> them<00:05:41.310> line<00:05:42.310> them<00:05:42.460> up<00:05:42.520> with<00:05:42.580> the<00:05:42.700> blue<00:05:42.910> face

00:05:43.170 --> 00:05:43.180 
put them line them up with the blue face

00:05:43.180 --> 00:05:45.090 
put them line them up with the blue face
into<00:05:43.570> the<00:05:43.600> two<00:05:43.840> between<00:05:44.050> the<00:05:44.290> blue<00:05:44.470> face<00:05:44.710> and

00:05:45.090 --> 00:05:45.100 
into the two between the blue face and

00:05:45.100 --> 00:05:47.159 
into the two between the blue face and
then<00:05:45.850> you<00:05:45.970> look<00:05:46.120> to<00:05:46.150> see<00:05:46.419> if<00:05:46.570> they<00:05:46.720> need<00:05:46.930> to<00:05:46.960> be

00:05:47.159 --> 00:05:47.169 
then you look to see if they need to be

00:05:47.169 --> 00:05:49.860 
then you look to see if they need to be
swapped<00:05:47.620> which<00:05:48.580> these<00:05:48.790> don't<00:05:49.060> because<00:05:49.750> we

00:05:49.860 --> 00:05:49.870 
swapped which these don't because we

00:05:49.870 --> 00:05:52.200 
swapped which these don't because we
resolved<00:05:50.350> and<00:05:50.770> then<00:05:51.490> you<00:05:51.550> turn<00:05:51.790> charlie

00:05:52.200 --> 00:05:52.210 
resolved and then you turn charlie

00:05:52.210 --> 00:05:55.380 
resolved and then you turn charlie
around<00:05:52.390> to<00:05:52.540> the<00:05:52.660> other<00:05:52.780> side<00:05:53.640> and<00:05:54.640> again<00:05:55.030> these

00:05:55.380 --> 00:05:55.390 
around to the other side and again these

00:05:55.390 --> 00:06:03.720 
around to the other side and again these
don't<00:05:55.720> also<00:06:00.870> okay<00:06:01.870> so<00:06:02.800> you<00:06:02.890> look<00:06:03.040> now<00:06:03.430> let's

00:06:03.720 --> 00:06:03.730 
don't also okay so you look now let's

00:06:03.730 --> 00:06:05.430 
don't also okay so you look now let's
pick<00:06:04.030> green<00:06:04.300> as<00:06:04.480> a<00:06:04.510> color<00:06:04.750> and<00:06:05.020> you<00:06:05.080> see<00:06:05.260> these

00:06:05.430 --> 00:06:05.440 
pick green as a color and you see these

00:06:05.440 --> 00:06:11.400 
pick green as a color and you see these
two<00:06:05.800> are<00:06:08.640> or<00:06:09.640> set<00:06:10.150> and<00:06:10.780> we<00:06:10.870> line<00:06:11.050> them<00:06:11.140> up<00:06:11.260> in

00:06:11.400 --> 00:06:11.410 
two are or set and we line them up in

00:06:11.410 --> 00:06:13.590 
two are or set and we line them up in
between<00:06:11.650> the<00:06:11.950> correct<00:06:12.340> phase<00:06:12.790> corresponding

00:06:13.590 --> 00:06:13.600 
between the correct phase corresponding

00:06:13.600 --> 00:06:16.080 
between the correct phase corresponding
face<00:06:13.810> color<00:06:14.140> because<00:06:14.440> greens<00:06:14.710> are<00:06:14.890> set<00:06:15.160> these

00:06:16.080 --> 00:06:16.090 
face color because greens are set these

00:06:16.090 --> 00:06:20.810 
face color because greens are set these
two<00:06:16.330> need<00:06:16.480> to<00:06:16.510> be<00:06:16.660> switched<00:06:18.540> but<00:06:19.540> these<00:06:19.750> don't

00:06:20.810 --> 00:06:20.820 
two need to be switched but these don't

00:06:20.820 --> 00:06:38.850 
two need to be switched but these don't
okay<00:06:21.850> I'll<00:06:22.720> show<00:06:22.930> you<00:06:23.020> the<00:06:23.140> algorithm<00:06:23.350> again

00:06:38.850 --> 00:06:38.860 

00:06:38.860 --> 00:06:42.730 

okay<00:06:40.690> let's<00:06:41.690> say<00:06:41.930> that<00:06:41.960> all<00:06:42.289> of<00:06:42.530> them<00:06:42.650> are

00:06:42.730 --> 00:06:42.740 
okay let's say that all of them are

00:06:42.740 --> 00:06:43.900 
okay let's say that all of them are
messed<00:06:42.949> up<00:06:43.070> again<00:06:43.310> I'll<00:06:43.460> show<00:06:43.580> you<00:06:43.699> one<00:06:43.850> more

00:06:43.900 --> 00:06:43.910 
messed up again I'll show you one more

00:06:43.910 --> 00:06:49.420 
messed up again I'll show you one more
time<00:06:47.560> okay<00:06:48.560> see<00:06:48.620> how<00:06:48.860> this<00:06:49.009> isn't<00:06:49.340> in<00:06:49.400> the

00:06:49.420 --> 00:06:49.430 
time okay see how this isn't in the

00:06:49.430 --> 00:06:50.830 
time okay see how this isn't in the
right<00:06:49.610> place<00:06:49.880> green<00:06:50.360> sky<00:06:50.570> that<00:06:50.690> we'll<00:06:50.810> just

00:06:50.830 --> 00:06:50.840 
right place green sky that we'll just

00:06:50.840 --> 00:06:52.390 
right place green sky that we'll just
pick<00:06:51.080> green<00:06:51.350> as<00:06:51.530> our<00:06:51.620> set<00:06:51.800> of<00:06:51.889> colors<00:06:52.130> again

00:06:52.390 --> 00:06:52.400 
pick green as our set of colors again

00:06:52.400 --> 00:06:56.110 
pick green as our set of colors again
and<00:06:53.259> this<00:06:54.259> isn't<00:06:54.470> in<00:06:54.680> the<00:06:54.770> right<00:06:54.889> place<00:06:55.160> turn

00:06:56.110 --> 00:06:56.120 
and this isn't in the right place turn

00:06:56.120 --> 00:06:57.999 
and this isn't in the right place turn
around<00:06:56.419> to<00:06:56.600> the<00:06:56.630> opposite<00:06:57.380> face<00:06:57.620> it<00:06:57.860> should<00:06:57.949> be

00:06:57.999 --> 00:06:58.009 
around to the opposite face it should be

00:06:58.009 --> 00:06:59.770 
around to the opposite face it should be
the<00:06:58.100> back<00:06:58.250> face<00:06:58.520> this<00:06:59.210> is<00:06:59.419> not<00:06:59.570> in<00:06:59.630> the<00:06:59.660> right

00:06:59.770 --> 00:06:59.780 
the back face this is not in the right

00:06:59.780 --> 00:07:01.930 
the back face this is not in the right
place<00:06:59.990> and<00:07:00.380> this<00:07:00.650> is<00:07:00.830> not<00:07:01.250> the<00:07:01.340> right<00:07:01.460> place<00:07:01.699> so

00:07:01.930 --> 00:07:01.940 
place and this is not the right place so

00:07:01.940 --> 00:07:04.330 
place and this is not the right place so
if<00:07:02.120> you<00:07:02.240> need<00:07:02.360> to<00:07:02.449> swap<00:07:02.630> these<00:07:02.930> and<00:07:03.500> easy<00:07:03.979> dude

00:07:04.330 --> 00:07:04.340 
if you need to swap these and easy dude

00:07:04.340 --> 00:07:06.010 
if you need to swap these and easy dude
all<00:07:04.520> in<00:07:04.639> one<00:07:04.789> move<00:07:04.970> and<00:07:05.270> again<00:07:05.509> while<00:07:05.750> you<00:07:05.870> got

00:07:06.010 --> 00:07:06.020 
all in one move and again while you got

00:07:06.020 --> 00:07:08.170 
all in one move and again while you got
to<00:07:06.050> recognize<00:07:06.320> this<00:07:06.590> move<00:07:07.000> already

00:07:08.170 --> 00:07:08.180 
to recognize this move already

00:07:08.180 --> 00:07:22.330
