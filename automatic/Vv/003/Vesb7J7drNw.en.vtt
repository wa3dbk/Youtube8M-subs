some more water see I think how its kind
of<00:05:24.250> glee<00:05:24.430> I'm<00:05:25.000> thingy<00:05:25.510> and<00:05:25.990> kind<00:05:26.289> of<00:05:26.380> close<00:05:26.740> it

00:05:26.940 --> 00:05:26.950 
of glee I'm thingy and kind of close it

00:05:26.950 --> 00:05:29.909 
of glee I'm thingy and kind of close it
a<00:05:27.070> little<00:05:27.250> more<00:05:27.460> smoothly<00:05:27.849> than<00:05:28.000> mine<00:05:28.740> did<00:05:29.740> you

00:05:29.909 --> 00:05:29.919 
a little more smoothly than mine did you

00:05:29.919 --> 00:05:33.810 
a little more smoothly than mine did you
do<00:05:30.070> a<00:05:30.450> really<00:05:31.450> big<00:05:31.780> on<00:05:31.930> mix<00:05:32.200> to<00:05:32.440> my<00:05:32.560> more<00:05:32.860> um<00:05:33.400> I

00:05:33.810 --> 00:05:33.820 
do a really big on mix to my more um I

00:05:33.820 --> 00:05:35.700 
do a really big on mix to my more um I
think<00:05:33.849> it's<00:05:34.300> because<00:05:34.479> she<00:05:34.930> put<00:05:35.139> more<00:05:35.289> water<00:05:35.500> in

00:05:35.700 --> 00:05:35.710 
think it's because she put more water in

00:05:35.710 --> 00:05:37.830 
think it's because she put more water in
I<00:05:36.130> think<00:05:36.760> I'm<00:05:36.880> going<00:05:37.060> to<00:05:37.150> get<00:05:37.300> some<00:05:37.479> more<00:05:37.630> water
