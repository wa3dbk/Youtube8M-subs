00:00:18.760 --> 00:00:18.770 
this background so let's see how to

00:00:18.770 --> 00:00:22.779 
this background so let's see how to
create<00:00:19.770> this<00:00:20.130> type<00:00:20.340> of<00:00:20.369> it<00:00:20.699> in<00:00:21.060> Photoshop<00:00:21.750> cs6

00:00:22.779 --> 00:00:22.789 
create this type of it in Photoshop cs6

00:00:22.789 --> 00:00:32.600 
create this type of it in Photoshop cs6
so<00:00:23.789> create<00:00:24.180> a<00:00:24.210> new<00:00:24.330> document<00:00:29.449> then<00:00:31.489> fill<00:00:32.489> it

00:00:32.600 --> 00:00:32.610 
so create a new document then fill it

00:00:32.610 --> 00:00:40.790 
so create a new document then fill it
with<00:00:34.460> black<00:00:35.540> then<00:00:36.540> go<00:00:36.780> to<00:00:36.840> filter<00:00:37.290> then<00:00:39.800> noise

00:00:40.790 --> 00:00:40.800 
with black then go to filter then noise

00:00:40.800 --> 00:00:47.420 
with black then go to filter then noise
then<00:00:41.790> air<00:00:42.059> noise<00:00:43.190> 60%<00:00:44.190> 54%<00:00:45.149> I<00:00:45.390> want<00:00:46.219> you<00:00:47.219> guys

00:00:47.420 --> 00:00:47.430 
then air noise 60% 54% I want you guys

00:00:47.430 --> 00:00:54.560 
then air noise 60% 54% I want you guys

00:01:53.990 --> 00:02:00.730 
its blend mode to overlay
I<00:01:55.600> will<00:01:56.600> try<00:01:56.869> this<00:01:59.380> again

00:02:00.730 --> 00:02:00.740 
I will try this again

00:02:00.740 --> 00:02:07.440 
I will try this again
check<00:02:01.429> overlay<00:02:02.000> and<00:02:02.330> reduce<00:02:03.200> its<00:02:03.770> opacity

00:02:07.440 --> 00:02:07.450

00:05:21.830 --> 00:05:21.840 
then I will reattach this value out I

00:05:21.840 --> 00:05:26.260 
then I will reattach this value out I
will<00:05:22.110> check<00:05:22.380> I<00:05:23.420> want<00:05:24.420> outer<00:05:24.630> bevel<00:05:25.230> then

00:05:26.260 --> 00:05:26.270 
will check I want outer bevel then

00:05:26.270 --> 00:05:31.790 
will check I want outer bevel then
diesel<00:05:27.270> heart<00:05:27.630> I<00:05:27.960> will<00:05:28.230> try<00:05:30.020> using<00:05:31.020> soft<00:05:31.380> so<00:05:31.650> I

00:05:31.790 --> 00:05:31.800 
diesel heart I will try using soft so I

00:05:31.800 --> 00:05:34.450 
diesel heart I will try using soft so I
think<00:05:32.100> smooth<00:05:32.610> is<00:05:32.850> working<00:05:33.240> better<00:05:33.420> for<00:05:33.750> this

linear<00:07:08.479> light<00:07:08.719> then<00:07:09.529> I<00:07:09.979> think<00:07:10.550> our<00:07:10.789> light<00:07:11.210> is

00:07:11.379 --> 00:07:11.389 
linear light then I think our light is

00:07:11.389 --> 00:07:19.649 
linear light then I think our light is
looking<00:07:11.749> better<00:07:15.999> now<00:07:16.999> set<00:07:17.270> it<00:07:17.419> spend<00:07:18.340> opacity

00:07:19.649 --> 00:07:19.659 
looking better now set it spend opacity

00:07:19.659 --> 00:07:25.800
