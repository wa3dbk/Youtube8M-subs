00:00:24.940 --> 00:00:33.510

00:00:30.460 --> 00:00:33.510

 angry video game zadrot 

00:00:40.430 --> 00:00:48.280
 represents 12 days of shit 

00:00:44.950 --> 00:00:48.280
 game 1 

00:00:50.320 --> 00:00:56.170
 Oh no not this 

00:00:53.410 --> 00:00:58.300
 daikin drake when the game is known only 

00:00:56.170 --> 00:01:00.520
 you already have your baby blue cartridge 

00:00:58.300 --> 00:01:02.910
 you know that it will hurt to put this 

00:01:00.520 --> 00:01:02.910
 pussy 

00:01:03.660 --> 00:01:07.810
 in how do I clearly remember which one 

00:01:06.550 --> 00:01:11.440
 pitiful that dragon 

00:01:07.810 --> 00:01:14.650
 he looks like sv clicking i don't know no 

00:01:11.440 --> 00:01:16.690
 words to describe his appearance obviously that 

00:01:14.650 --> 00:01:18.640
 flea need to work another team 

00:01:16.690 --> 00:01:20.680
 because this dragon looks pretty 

00:01:18.640 --> 00:01:22.210
 vata and that means you have to prepare 

00:01:20.680 --> 00:01:26.380
 to go into it three games 

00:01:22.210 --> 00:01:28.509
 which one that's all came back to me 

00:01:26.380 --> 00:01:30.660
 baby I took this game at the box office on it 

00:01:28.509 --> 00:01:33.970
 there was not even a print quality nintendo 

00:01:30.660 --> 00:01:37.020
 so it's not clear what side I took this 

00:01:33.970 --> 00:01:39.310
 game goal of the game is very simple 

00:01:37.020 --> 00:01:42.880
 bite other dragons by the tail and 

00:01:39.310 --> 00:01:44.530
 you get to the next node that's all you 

00:01:42.880 --> 00:01:46.330
 think dragons will do something 

00:01:44.530 --> 00:01:47.890
 gorgeous for example fly or take a look 

00:01:46.330 --> 00:01:50.729
 make fire everything they do 

00:01:47.890 --> 00:01:53.080
 rush one after another like a pack of monkeys 

00:01:50.729 --> 00:01:55.140
 I don't even know how to do it 

00:01:53.080 --> 00:01:58.630
 dragons are not so boring 

00:01:55.140 --> 00:02:00.610
 everything blocks you you need a super accurate 

00:01:58.630 --> 00:02:04.920
 to turn the cold on that dragon 

00:02:00.610 --> 00:02:04.920
 I like to ride on a wagon on the road at 

00:02:06.420 --> 00:02:12.340
 you have no long range attacks all you 

00:02:09.549 --> 00:02:14.320
 can bite others behind the ass sometimes it 

00:02:12.340 --> 00:02:19.299
 sometimes there isnâ€™t working 

00:02:14.320 --> 00:02:21.780
 hammer buttons hope for better come on 

00:02:19.299 --> 00:02:21.780
 mazafaka 

00:02:24.400 --> 00:02:28.980
 Well, you just look, look 

00:02:39.970 --> 00:02:42.330
 my 

00:02:46.800 --> 00:02:51.430
 even if you killed all no 

00:02:49.540 --> 00:02:53.740
 satisfaction we fail because 

00:02:51.430 --> 00:02:55.150
 that it all looks like dumb and luck 

00:02:53.740 --> 00:02:57.010
 This is a game that can be played. 

00:02:55.150 --> 00:02:57.430
 shot eyes and the difference is not 

00:02:57.010 --> 00:02:59.410
 will be 

00:02:57.430 --> 00:03:03.550
 round after round crawling this button up 

00:02:59.410 --> 00:03:05.950
 amazing and madness three deaths and here you are 

00:03:03.550 --> 00:03:09.190
 back to the beginning there are even boxes 

00:03:05.950 --> 00:03:11.440
 versus modes ago 

00:03:09.190 --> 00:03:14.380
 Imagine two working friends together 

00:03:11.440 --> 00:03:17.440
 playing super smash bros and you 

00:03:14.380 --> 00:03:19.540
 dragon can despite the fact that I took 

00:03:17.440 --> 00:03:21.340
 I played her for a couple of minutes 

00:03:19.540 --> 00:03:23.440
 which is rare when you take 

00:03:21.340 --> 00:03:26.050
 the game you want to squeeze all the juice out of it 

00:03:23.440 --> 00:03:29.890
 even if it's shit and you have nothing else 

00:03:26.050 --> 00:03:32.200
 make a choice yes no but a day when you 

00:03:29.890 --> 00:03:38.920
 took this game you just take will in 

00:03:32.200 --> 00:03:39.670
 fist and break the cartridge well it was 

00:03:38.920 --> 00:03:43.840
 painfully 

00:03:39.670 --> 00:03:46.989
 and the orgy has just begun 

00:03:43.840 --> 00:03:51.330
 translated igors uzokov voiced nik ruin 

00:03:46.989 --> 00:03:51.330
 especially for the channel trio of fagots
