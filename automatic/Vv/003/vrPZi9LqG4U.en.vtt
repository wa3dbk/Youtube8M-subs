00:00:17.950 --> 00:00:17.960 
talking about thirty plus years later

00:00:17.960 --> 00:00:20.230 
talking about thirty plus years later
that<00:00:18.530> is<00:00:18.650> really<00:00:19.190> really<00:00:19.490> low<00:00:19.760> mileage<00:00:20.120> me

00:00:20.230 --> 00:00:20.240 
that is really really low mileage me

00:00:20.240 --> 00:00:22.600 
that is really really low mileage me
think<00:00:20.510> about<00:00:20.720> how<00:00:21.470> many<00:00:21.530> miles<00:00:21.770> a<00:00:21.980> year<00:00:22.010> a<00:00:22.340> car

00:00:22.600 --> 00:00:22.610 
think about how many miles a year a car

00:00:22.610 --> 00:00:24.040 
think about how many miles a year a car
like<00:00:22.760> this<00:00:22.880> was<00:00:23.090> driven<00:00:23.270> it's<00:00:23.510> his<00:00:23.630> car<00:00:23.840> was

00:00:24.040 --> 00:00:24.050 
like this was driven it's his car was

00:00:24.050 --> 00:00:26.590 
like this was driven it's his car was
only<00:00:24.200> driven<00:00:24.700> two<00:00:25.700> thousand<00:00:26.210> miles<00:00:26.360> a<00:00:26.539> year

00:00:26.590 --> 00:00:26.600 
only driven two thousand miles a year

00:00:26.600 --> 00:00:28.510 
only driven two thousand miles a year
but<00:00:27.289> it's<00:00:27.410> been<00:00:27.500> driven<00:00:27.590> even<00:00:27.860> less<00:00:28.160> than<00:00:28.400> that

00:00:28.510 --> 00:00:28.520 
but it's been driven even less than that

00:00:28.520 --> 00:00:29.470 
but it's been driven even less than that
so<00:00:28.580> that's<00:00:28.820> pretty<00:00:29.000> cool<00:00:29.210> when<00:00:29.360> you<00:00:29.420> think

00:00:29.470 --> 00:00:29.480 
so that's pretty cool when you think

00:00:29.480 --> 00:00:31.690 
so that's pretty cool when you think
about<00:00:29.660> it<00:00:29.930> anyway<00:00:30.470> a<00:00:30.500> lot<00:00:31.010> of<00:00:31.100> original<00:00:31.460> stuff

00:00:31.690 --> 00:00:31.700 
about it anyway a lot of original stuff

00:00:31.700 --> 00:00:33.819 
about it anyway a lot of original stuff
on<00:00:31.910> it<00:00:32.090> some<00:00:32.539> updated<00:00:32.989> stuff<00:00:33.170> on<00:00:33.409> it<00:00:33.589> it<00:00:33.710> makes

00:00:33.819 --> 00:00:33.829 
on it some updated stuff on it it makes

00:00:33.829 --> 00:00:35.319 
on it some updated stuff on it it makes
it<00:00:33.980> a<00:00:34.070> little<00:00:34.190> more<00:00:34.309> drivable<00:00:34.760> this<00:00:35.030> does<00:00:35.179> have

00:00:35.319 --> 00:00:35.329 
it a little more drivable this does have

00:00:35.329 --> 00:00:36.849 
it a little more drivable this does have
the<00:00:35.359> fuel<00:00:35.659> injection<00:00:36.019> which<00:00:36.289> really<00:00:36.559> is<00:00:36.829> a

00:00:36.849 --> 00:00:36.859 
the fuel injection which really is a

00:00:36.859 --> 00:00:38.829 
the fuel injection which really is a
nice<00:00:37.789> feature<00:00:38.059> especially<00:00:38.239> when<00:00:38.569> it's<00:00:38.690> hot

00:00:38.829 --> 00:00:38.839 
nice feature especially when it's hot

00:00:38.839 --> 00:00:40.450 
nice feature especially when it's hot
out<00:00:39.050> or<00:00:39.230> really<00:00:39.440> cold<00:00:39.679> just<00:00:39.920> hit<00:00:40.010> the<00:00:40.100> key<00:00:40.280> it

00:00:40.450 --> 00:00:40.460 
out or really cold just hit the key it

00:00:40.460 --> 00:00:43.479 
out or really cold just hit the key it
fires<00:00:40.699> right<00:00:40.789> up<00:00:40.969> boom<00:00:41.719> and<00:00:41.989> I<00:00:42.710> think<00:00:43.399> quite

00:00:43.479 --> 00:00:43.489 
fires right up boom and I think quite

00:00:43.489 --> 00:00:45.669 
fires right up boom and I think quite
honestly<00:00:43.609> part<00:00:44.269> of<00:00:44.480> the<00:00:45.019> allure<00:00:45.260> of<00:00:45.289> this<00:00:45.499> car

00:00:45.669 --> 00:00:45.679 
honestly part of the allure of this car

00:00:45.679 --> 00:00:47.020 
honestly part of the allure of this car
and<00:00:45.800> why<00:00:45.920> it's<00:00:46.069> lasted<00:00:46.429> so<00:00:46.550> long<00:00:46.579> is<00:00:46.879> because

00:00:47.020 --> 00:00:47.030 
and why it's lasted so long is because

00:00:47.030 --> 00:00:48.759 
and why it's lasted so long is because
it<00:00:47.659> was<00:00:47.809> a<00:00:47.839> white<00:00:48.079> car<00:00:48.319> you<00:00:48.440> know<00:00:48.559> some<00:00:48.710> of

00:01:10.160 --> 00:01:12.100 
doesn't show up in the video but come on
up<00:01:10.310> we'll<00:01:10.430> look<00:01:10.520> at<00:01:10.640> it<00:01:10.790> anyway<00:01:10.970> but<00:01:11.750> somehow

00:01:12.100 --> 00:01:12.110 
up we'll look at it anyway but somehow

00:01:12.110 --> 00:01:15.130 
up we'll look at it anyway but somehow
maybe<00:01:12.320> you<00:01:12.470> can<00:01:12.620> see<00:01:12.860> the<00:01:13.850> sheen<00:01:14.120> and<00:01:14.450> I<00:01:14.900> think

00:01:15.130 --> 00:01:15.140 
maybe you can see the sheen and I think

00:01:15.140 --> 00:01:18.370 
maybe you can see the sheen and I think
that<00:01:15.290> probably<00:01:15.440> you<00:01:15.920> can<00:01:16.130> read<00:01:17.050> inside<00:01:18.050> there

00:01:18.370 --> 00:01:18.380 
that probably you can read inside there

00:01:18.380 --> 00:01:20.140 
that probably you can read inside there
some<00:01:18.860> of<00:01:18.950> the<00:01:19.040> clarity<00:01:19.730> of<00:01:19.760> that<00:01:19.940> and<00:01:20.090> that's

00:01:20.140 --> 00:01:20.150 
some of the clarity of that and that's

00:01:20.150 --> 00:01:22.720 
some of the clarity of that and that's
in<00:01:20.390> every<00:01:20.540> panel<00:01:21.050> as<00:01:21.230> well<00:01:21.440> but<00:01:22.130> hopefully

00:01:22.720 --> 00:01:22.730 
in every panel as well but hopefully

00:01:22.730 --> 00:01:24.100 
in every panel as well but hopefully
you'll<00:01:23.030> take<00:01:23.180> our<00:01:23.300> word<00:01:23.420> for<00:01:23.450> it<00:01:23.660> it<00:01:23.750> really<00:01:23.930> is

00:01:24.100 --> 00:01:24.110 
you'll take our word for it it really is

00:01:24.110 --> 00:01:25.450 
you'll take our word for it it really is
very<00:01:24.200> nice<00:01:24.440> paint<00:01:24.680> especially<00:01:24.800> since<00:01:25.310> it's

00:01:25.450 --> 00:01:25.460 
very nice paint especially since it's

00:01:25.460 --> 00:01:27.550 
very nice paint especially since it's
been<00:01:25.580> repainted<00:01:25.970> so<00:01:26.420> it<00:01:26.870> looks<00:01:27.020> very<00:01:27.110> nice<00:01:27.350> so

00:01:27.550 --> 00:01:27.560

plenty of juice again the nice automatic

00:04:27.820 --> 00:04:29.310 
plenty of juice again the nice automatic
in<00:04:27.940> here<00:04:28.150> is<00:04:28.300> that<00:04:28.420> it's<00:04:28.570> an<00:04:28.690> overdrive

00:04:29.310 --> 00:04:29.320
