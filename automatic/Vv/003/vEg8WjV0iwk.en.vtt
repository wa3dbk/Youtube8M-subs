00:00:36.740 --> 00:00:36.750 
time ago from his home and began by

00:00:36.750 --> 00:00:39.410 
time ago from his home and began by
asking<00:00:36.780> if<00:00:37.320> the<00:00:37.500> enormity<00:00:38.429> of<00:00:38.460> fighting<00:00:39.269> at

00:00:39.410 --> 00:00:39.420 
asking if the enormity of fighting at

00:00:39.420 --> 00:00:42.439 
asking if the enormity of fighting at
Wembley<00:00:40.109> had<00:00:40.379> sunk<00:00:40.649> in<00:00:40.829> I<00:00:41.039> don't<00:00:42.030> think<00:00:42.089> a<00:00:42.300> as

00:00:42.439 --> 00:00:42.449 
Wembley had sunk in I don't think a as

00:00:42.449 --> 00:00:44.119 
Wembley had sunk in I don't think a as
it<00:00:42.600> probably<00:00:43.019> won't<00:00:43.230> sink<00:00:43.559> in<00:00:43.769> until<00:00:43.890> I'm

00:00:44.119 --> 00:00:44.129 
it probably won't sink in until I'm

00:00:44.129 --> 00:00:45.590 
it probably won't sink in until I'm
doing<00:00:44.370> my<00:00:44.460> ring<00:00:44.640> walk<00:00:44.820> to<00:00:45.030> be<00:00:45.149> honest<00:00:45.390> because

00:00:45.590 --> 00:00:45.600 
doing my ring walk to be honest because

00:00:45.600 --> 00:00:48.919 
doing my ring walk to be honest because
you<00:00:46.170> know<00:00:46.289> 20,000<00:00:47.129> at<00:00:47.219> the<00:00:47.309> o2<00:00:47.429> in<00:00:48.120> London<00:00:48.780> was

00:00:48.919 --> 00:00:48.929 
you know 20,000 at the o2 in London was

00:00:48.929 --> 00:00:50.660 
you know 20,000 at the o2 in London was
massive<00:00:49.350> and<00:00:49.530> this<00:00:49.769> potentially<00:00:50.429> could<00:00:50.609> be

00:00:50.660 --> 00:00:50.670 
massive and this potentially could be

00:00:50.670 --> 00:00:52.700 
massive and this potentially could be
well<00:00:51.420> it<00:00:51.510> could<00:00:51.659> be<00:00:51.690> quadruple<00:00:52.350> that<00:00:52.469> we<00:00:52.589> can

00:00:52.700 --> 00:00:52.710 
well it could be quadruple that we can

00:00:52.710 --> 00:00:55.160 
well it could be quadruple that we can
get<00:00:52.890> as<00:00:52.980> much<00:00:53.129> up<00:00:53.309> to<00:00:53.809> 80,000<00:00:54.809> i<00:00:54.870> think<00:00:55.019> in

00:00:55.160 --> 00:00:55.170 
get as much up to 80,000 i think in

00:00:55.170 --> 00:00:57.439 
get as much up to 80,000 i think in
wembley<00:00:55.530> so<00:00:55.769> it<00:00:56.429> just<00:00:56.670> shows<00:00:56.850> the<00:00:56.879> magnitude

00:00:57.439 --> 00:00:57.449 
wembley so it just shows the magnitude

00:00:57.449 --> 00:00:58.970 
wembley so it just shows the magnitude
of<00:00:57.569> the<00:00:57.659> fight<00:00:57.870> and<00:00:58.050> potentially<00:00:58.800> you<00:00:58.949> know

00:00:58.970 --> 00:00:58.980 
of the fight and potentially you know

00:00:58.980 --> 00:01:01.489 
of the fight and potentially you know
what<00:00:59.309> we<00:00:59.460> we<00:00:59.969> Mabel<00:01:00.329> to<00:01:00.420> do<00:01:00.539> so<00:01:00.749> you<00:01:01.289> know<00:01:01.379> it's

00:01:01.489 --> 00:01:01.499 
what we we Mabel to do so you know it's

00:01:01.499 --> 00:01:03.799 
what we we Mabel to do so you know it's
proud<00:01:01.710> for<00:01:01.949> me<00:01:02.039> to<00:01:02.219> be<00:01:02.309> able<00:01:02.370> to<00:01:02.609> you<00:01:03.359> know<00:01:03.479> feel

00:01:03.799 --> 00:01:03.809 
proud for me to be able to you know feel

00:01:03.809 --> 00:01:06.530 
proud for me to be able to you know feel
a<00:01:03.870> stadium<00:01:04.260> of<00:01:04.530> such<00:01:04.800> magnitude<00:01:05.450> for<00:01:06.450> this

00:01:06.530 --> 00:01:06.540 
a stadium of such magnitude for this

00:01:06.540 --> 00:01:08.210 
a stadium of such magnitude for this
event<00:01:06.780> but<00:01:07.110> it<00:01:07.200> shows<00:01:07.380> how<00:01:07.410> big<00:01:07.710> the<00:01:07.800> event<00:01:08.040> is

00:01:08.210 --> 00:01:08.220 
event but it shows how big the event is

00:01:08.220 --> 00:01:10.730 
event but it shows how big the event is
guess<00:01:08.910> its<00:01:09.360> massive<00:01:09.780> isn't<00:01:10.020> it<00:01:10.110> how<00:01:10.440> will<00:01:10.620> you

00:01:10.730 --> 00:01:10.740 
guess its massive isn't it how will you

00:01:10.740 --> 00:01:12.170 
guess its massive isn't it how will you
approach<00:01:10.860> this<00:01:11.400> I<00:01:11.610> mean<00:01:11.700> I<00:01:11.790> assume<00:01:11.850> you're

approach this I mean I assume you're

00:01:12.180 --> 00:01:13.880 
approach this I mean I assume you're
going<00:01:12.360> to<00:01:12.420> change<00:01:13.020> your<00:01:13.140> tactics<00:01:13.350> slightly

00:01:13.880 --> 00:01:13.890 
going to change your tactics slightly

00:01:13.890 --> 00:01:15.290

from<00:01:14.010> the<00:01:14.100> previous<00:01:14.460> fight<00:01:14.610> you<00:01:14.790> you<00:01:14.820> South

00:01:15.290 --> 00:01:15.300 
from the previous fight you you South

00:01:15.300 --> 00:01:17.120 
from the previous fight you you South
have<00:01:15.450> said<00:01:15.660> to<00:01:15.810> me<00:01:15.840> that<00:01:16.110> you<00:01:16.500> weren't<00:01:16.710> the

00:01:17.120 --> 00:01:17.130 
have said to me that you weren't the

00:01:17.130 --> 00:01:18.620 
have said to me that you weren't the
best<00:01:17.310> you<00:01:17.550> can<00:01:17.670> be<00:01:17.850> in<00:01:18.030> that<00:01:18.150> last<00:01:18.330> fight

00:01:18.620 --> 00:01:18.630 
best you can be in that last fight

00:01:18.630 --> 00:01:20.930 
best you can be in that last fight
what's<00:01:18.840> going<00:01:18.990> to<00:01:19.050> be<00:01:19.110> different<00:01:19.880> yeah<00:01:20.880> I

00:01:20.930 --> 00:01:20.940 
what's going to be different yeah I

00:01:20.940 --> 00:01:22.280 
what's going to be different yeah I
think<00:01:21.000> in<00:01:21.240> the<00:01:21.330> first<00:01:21.540> fight<00:01:21.750> he<00:01:21.870> got<00:01:21.900> inside

00:01:22.280 --> 00:01:22.290 
think in the first fight he got inside

00:01:22.290 --> 00:01:24.020 
think in the first fight he got inside
my<00:01:22.350> head<00:01:22.590> a<00:01:22.620> little<00:01:22.800> bit<00:01:22.920> he<00:01:23.340> wound<00:01:23.550> me<00:01:23.790> up<00:01:23.820> he

00:01:24.020 --> 00:01:24.030 
my head a little bit he wound me up he

00:01:24.030 --> 00:01:26.270 
my head a little bit he wound me up he
got<00:01:24.120> under<00:01:24.240> my<00:01:24.330> skin<00:01:24.690> and<00:01:24.900> I<00:01:25.320> went<00:01:25.890> out<00:01:26.070> there

one<00:02:04.110> way<00:02:04.140> again<00:02:04.470> I<00:02:04.500> think<00:02:04.710> he's<00:02:04.800> going<00:02:04.920> to<00:02:05.010> fall

00:02:05.210 --> 00:02:05.220 
one way again I think he's going to fall

00:02:05.220 --> 00:02:07.280 
one way again I think he's going to fall
apart<00:02:05.370> as<00:02:05.790> the<00:02:05.940> fight<00:02:06.150> goes<00:02:06.180> on<00:02:06.600> as<00:02:06.810> I<00:02:06.960> start

00:02:07.280 --> 00:02:07.290 
apart as the fight goes on as I start

00:02:07.290 --> 00:02:08.779 
apart as the fight goes on as I start
hitting<00:02:07.560> him<00:02:07.680> around<00:02:07.830> the<00:02:07.920> body<00:02:08.099> and<00:02:08.369> head<00:02:08.580> I

00:02:08.779 --> 00:02:08.789 
hitting him around the body and head I

00:02:08.789 --> 00:02:10.609 
hitting him around the body and head I
honestly<00:02:09.660> don't<00:02:09.959> think<00:02:10.080> he's<00:02:10.319> tough<00:02:10.500> enough

00:02:10.609 --> 00:02:10.619 
honestly don't think he's tough enough

00:02:10.619 --> 00:02:12.470 
honestly don't think he's tough enough
but<00:02:10.830> he'd<00:02:11.489> have<00:02:11.519> learnt<00:02:11.819> from<00:02:11.939> that<00:02:12.030> fight<00:02:12.299> it

00:02:12.470 --> 00:02:12.480 
but he'd have learnt from that fight it

00:02:12.480 --> 00:02:14.330 
but he'd have learnt from that fight it
will<00:02:12.569> realize<00:02:12.930> that<00:02:13.230> you<00:02:13.379> know<00:02:13.409> I<00:02:13.709> can<00:02:14.069> be<00:02:14.189> hurt
