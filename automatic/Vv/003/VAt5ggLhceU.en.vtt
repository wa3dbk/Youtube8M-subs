00:02:46.650 --> 00:02:46.660 
stops about after after four rows so you

00:02:46.660 --> 00:02:48.390 
stops about after after four rows so you

you'll<00:02:48.519> just<00:02:48.580> stop<00:02:48.970> automatically<00:02:49.510> so<00:02:49.660> you

00:02:49.680 --> 00:02:49.690 
you'll just stop automatically so you

00:02:49.690 --> 00:02:51.539 
you'll just stop automatically so you
can't<00:02:49.930> just<00:02:50.140> go<00:02:50.769> all<00:02:50.950> the<00:02:50.980> way<00:02:51.069> to<00:02:51.160> top<00:02:51.370> you've

00:02:51.539 --> 00:02:51.549 
can't just go all the way to top you've

00:02:51.549 --> 00:02:53.699 
can't just go all the way to top you've
got<00:02:51.580> to<00:02:51.700> do<00:02:52.209> it<00:02:52.269> or<00:02:52.360> like<00:02:52.450> this<00:02:52.630> and<00:02:52.870> I<00:02:53.560> guess

00:02:53.709 --> 00:02:55.170 
got to do it or like this and I guess
for<00:02:53.860> some<00:02:53.920> people<00:02:54.069> that's<00:02:54.459> nicer<00:02:55.000> because

00:02:55.170 --> 00:02:55.180 
for some people that's nicer because

00:02:55.180 --> 00:02:57.060 
for some people that's nicer because
they<00:02:55.390> have<00:02:55.510> a<00:02:55.750> bit<00:02:56.110> more<00:02:56.140> control<00:02:56.410> over<00:02:56.739> their

00:02:57.060 --> 00:02:57.070

they have a bit more control over their
apps<00:02:57.340> or<00:02:57.579> it's<00:02:57.760> easier<00:02:58.060> to<00:02:58.150> find<00:02:58.360> things<00:02:58.600> I<00:02:58.840> do

really is different to the normal
Android<00:04:13.859> one<00:04:14.599> let<00:04:15.599> me<00:04:15.629> go<00:04:15.719> to<00:04:15.870> music<00:04:21.500> now<00:04:22.500> you

can<00:04:22.680> see<00:04:23.240> you<00:04:24.240> just<00:04:24.449> go<00:04:24.570> through<00:04:24.750> this<00:04:24.810> color

00:04:25.040 --> 00:04:25.050 
can see you just go through this color

00:04:25.050 --> 00:04:29.960 
can see you just go through this color
flow<00:04:25.289> basically<00:04:25.740> all<00:04:25.919> the<00:04:26.039> time<00:04:28.820> and<00:04:29.820> then

00:04:29.960 --> 00:04:29.970 
flow basically all the time and then

00:04:29.970 --> 00:04:32.570 
flow basically all the time and then
that<00:04:30.479> it's<00:04:30.840> um<00:04:31.050> I<00:04:31.320> guess<00:04:32.039> it's<00:04:32.190> a<00:04:32.250> bit<00:04:32.370> nicer

00:04:32.570 --> 00:04:32.580

00:04:36.070 --> 00:04:36.080 
prefer using things like double twist

00:04:36.080 --> 00:04:38.659 
prefer using things like double twist
and<00:04:37.080> then<00:04:37.440> their<00:04:37.800> last<00:04:37.919> kind<00:04:38.340> of<00:04:38.430> things<00:04:38.580> I'd
