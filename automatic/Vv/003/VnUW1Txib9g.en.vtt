00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.400
 and I'm flat race is still only 

00:00:02.460 --> 00:00:07.259
 even under a little 

00:00:04.400 --> 00:00:09.300
 the six will be in an instant with this 

00:00:07.259 --> 00:00:12.120
 all and one and a half remain not myself 

00:00:09.300 --> 00:00:15.710
 saves the main thing that he fears judging 

00:00:12.120 --> 00:00:18.090
 in all this someone that fate again 

00:00:15.710 --> 00:00:19.560
 will demonstrate his grimace and that hands 

00:00:18.090 --> 00:00:22.980
 no one be padla same or anyone 

00:00:19.560 --> 00:00:24.840
 weak and here it is the speed exit to 

00:00:22.980 --> 00:00:27.380
 the final straight and Nikita 

00:00:24.840 --> 00:00:30.840
 gets in a box now 

00:00:27.380 --> 00:00:33.390
 breaks into a cut becomes surrenders 

00:00:30.840 --> 00:00:34.350
 on can get out come on come on come on barely 

00:00:33.390 --> 00:00:37.559
 didn't lose it 

00:00:34.350 --> 00:00:41.070
 but parallel to Nikita’s course 

00:00:37.559 --> 00:00:43.739
 gold medal is bound to be issued in 

00:00:41.070 --> 00:00:49.399
 leaders nikita hooks going through and 

00:00:43.739 --> 00:00:49.399
 becomes absolut world champion plate 

00:00:51.350 --> 00:01:03.449
 great finish sprinter from god what 

00:00:58.769 --> 00:01:05.940
 there's more to say and cocks your collection 

00:01:03.449 --> 00:01:09.920
 awards he won the world cup stages 

00:01:05.940 --> 00:01:13.979
 won the prestigious world cup stage 

00:01:09.920 --> 00:01:16.649
 portions of many days but never 

00:01:13.979 --> 00:01:20.820
 became a world champion and finally 

00:01:16.649 --> 00:01:23.880
 here in this pair of picking which 

00:01:20.820 --> 00:01:27.450
 discussed you remember but yuri kaminsky 

00:01:23.880 --> 00:01:29.190
 was hard and he bet on them though 

00:01:27.450 --> 00:01:33.080
 again the chances of mari lavo too 

00:01:29.190 --> 00:01:33.080
 were not considered to say that he 

00:01:33.530 --> 00:01:40.380
 was also bad never he was 

00:01:37.340 --> 00:01:43.740
 equivalent contender for this position but 

00:01:40.380 --> 00:01:47.119
 roosters I pumped some teenagers in 

00:01:43.740 --> 00:01:49.740
 This was no doubt a hook 

00:01:47.119 --> 00:01:52.710
 completes a general breakthrough in his 

00:01:49.740 --> 00:01:55.500
 career and today he is 

00:01:52.710 --> 00:01:57.780
 titled sprinter world champion 

00:01:55.500 --> 00:02:02.820
 olympic games and double champion 

00:01:57.780 --> 00:02:05.759
 peace we saw this dear friends we 

00:02:02.820 --> 00:02:10.679
 happy about it and guard you become 

00:02:05.759 --> 00:02:12.239
 witnesses such is astounding 

00:02:10.679 --> 00:02:17.790
 achievements that there with bronze still 

00:02:12.239 --> 00:02:19.950
 interesting aion price just had nothing 

00:02:17.790 --> 00:02:21.890
 here I think I’ll take a half-a-day and 

00:02:19.950 --> 00:02:25.140
 Kazakhstan team 

00:02:21.890 --> 00:02:26.610
 I think they get the Canadians bronze 

00:02:25.140 --> 00:02:30.980
 parting not only with the title 

00:02:26.610 --> 00:02:33.890
 champions but also loses the status of decors 

00:02:30.980 --> 00:02:36.459
 what a great clever read 

00:02:33.890 --> 00:02:40.120
 properly distributed race and although 

00:02:36.459 --> 00:02:42.980
 there were dangers but remember at least 

00:02:40.120 --> 00:02:45.640
 just a little bit and it would fall but 

00:02:42.980 --> 00:02:49.010
 this sprint is the maximum risk of manners 

00:02:45.640 --> 00:02:53.000
 Nikita krukova were desperately dangerous but 

00:02:49.010 --> 00:02:55.340
 how effective bravo-bravo 

00:02:53.000 --> 00:02:58.120
 our racers bravo coaching 

00:02:55.340 --> 00:03:01.900
 the team that brought Russia 

00:02:58.120 --> 00:03:01.900
 lawmakers sprint
