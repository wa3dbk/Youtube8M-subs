actually being about 40 millimeters wide
still<00:00:40.840> not<00:00:40.990> considered<00:00:41.440> a<00:00:41.500> huge<00:00:41.800> watch<00:00:42.040> but<00:00:42.400> at

00:00:42.480 --> 00:00:42.490 
still not considered a huge watch but at

00:00:42.490 --> 00:00:44.520 
still not considered a huge watch but at
the<00:00:42.580> older<00:00:42.880> one<00:00:43.030> I<00:00:43.060> think<00:00:43.180> was<00:00:43.420> 38<00:00:43.990> maybe<00:00:44.260> even

00:00:44.520 --> 00:00:44.530 
the older one I think was 38 maybe even

00:00:44.530 --> 00:00:48.210 
the older one I think was 38 maybe even
37<00:00:45.190> so<00:00:45.400> it<00:00:45.970> doesn't<00:00:46.690> feel<00:00:46.960> as<00:00:47.020> big<00:00:47.590> as<00:00:47.830> a<00:00:47.860> lot<00:00:48.100> of

00:00:48.210 --> 00:00:48.220 
37 so it doesn't feel as big as a lot of

00:00:48.220 --> 00:00:51.030 
37 so it doesn't feel as big as a lot of
watches<00:00:48.610> these<00:00:48.760> days<00:00:49.000> but<00:00:49.560> the<00:00:50.560> good<00:00:50.740> thing<00:00:50.920> is

00:00:51.030 --> 00:00:51.040 
watches these days but the good thing is

00:00:51.040 --> 00:00:52.650 
watches these days but the good thing is
it's<00:00:51.190> not<00:00:51.340> really<00:00:51.400> obtrusive<00:00:52.180> on<00:00:52.300> your<00:00:52.480> wrist

00:00:52.650 --> 00:00:52.660 
it's not really obtrusive on your wrist

00:00:52.660 --> 00:00:55.590 
it's not really obtrusive on your wrist
and<00:00:52.810> it's<00:00:52.960> really<00:00:53.260> easy<00:00:53.410> to<00:00:53.590> see<00:00:54.120> the<00:00:55.120> case<00:00:55.360> has

00:00:55.590 --> 00:00:55.600 
and it's really easy to see the case has

00:00:55.600 --> 00:00:57.660 
and it's really easy to see the case has
a<00:00:55.630> really<00:00:56.020> nice<00:00:56.200> quality<00:00:56.530> feel<00:00:56.980> to<00:00:57.190> it<00:00:57.340> the

00:00:57.660 --> 00:00:57.670

with a leather strap the watch has

00:01:06.210 --> 00:01:06.220 
something called temptation on which is

00:01:06.220 --> 00:01:08.550 
something called temptation on which is
some<00:01:06.549> type<00:01:06.729> of<00:01:06.759> a<00:01:06.939> coating<00:01:07.210> that<00:01:07.570> is

00:01:08.550 --> 00:01:08.560 
some type of a coating that is

00:01:08.560 --> 00:01:11.190 
some type of a coating that is
blasted<00:01:09.520> on<00:01:09.729> the<00:01:10.329> watch<00:01:10.539> and<00:01:10.749> some<00:01:10.990> type<00:01:11.170> of

00:01:11.190 --> 00:01:11.200 
blasted on the watch and some type of

00:01:11.200 --> 00:01:13.289 
blasted on the watch and some type of
machine<00:01:11.439> and<00:01:11.920> then<00:01:12.249> the<00:01:12.340> black<00:01:12.579> coating<00:01:13.149> is

00:01:13.289 --> 00:01:13.299 
machine and then the black coating is

00:01:13.299 --> 00:01:15.149 
machine and then the black coating is
applied<00:01:13.630> in<00:01:14.170> a<00:01:14.229> similar<00:01:14.560> manner<00:01:14.740> it's

00:01:15.149 --> 00:01:15.159 
applied in a similar manner it's

00:01:15.159 --> 00:01:17.130 
applied in a similar manner it's
interesting<00:01:15.460> because<00:01:15.819> when<00:01:16.450> you<00:01:16.509> first<00:01:16.780> get

00:01:17.130 --> 00:01:17.140 
interesting because when you first get

00:01:17.140 --> 00:01:20.129 
interesting because when you first get
the<00:01:17.380> watch<00:01:17.590> I<00:01:17.950> bought<00:01:18.219> this<00:01:18.369> one<00:01:18.549> new<00:01:18.899> you<00:01:19.899> you

00:01:20.129 --> 00:01:20.139 
the watch I bought this one new you you

00:01:20.139 --> 00:01:23.279 
the watch I bought this one new you you
can<00:01:20.619> tell<00:01:20.920> that<00:01:21.520> there's<00:01:22.329> a<00:01:22.389> coating<00:01:22.869> on<00:01:23.020> there

00:01:23.279 --> 00:01:23.289 
can tell that there's a coating on there

00:01:23.289 --> 00:01:24.899 
can tell that there's a coating on there
so<00:01:23.469> for<00:01:23.619> example<00:01:23.920> the<00:01:24.009> bracelet<00:01:24.520> felt<00:01:24.789> a

00:01:24.899 --> 00:01:24.909 
so for example the bracelet felt a

00:01:24.909 --> 00:01:26.550 
so for example the bracelet felt a
little<00:01:25.030> bit<00:01:25.270> rough<00:01:25.569> it<00:01:25.810> still<00:01:26.079> does<00:01:26.259> a<00:01:26.289> little

00:01:26.550 --> 00:01:26.560 
little bit rough it still does a little

00:01:26.560 --> 00:01:28.410 
little bit rough it still does a little
bit<00:01:26.679> because<00:01:27.369> this<00:01:27.670> stuff<00:01:27.909> was<00:01:28.030> put<00:01:28.270> on

00:01:28.410 --> 00:01:28.420 
bit because this stuff was put on

00:01:28.420 --> 00:01:31.379 
bit because this stuff was put on
they're<00:01:28.920> not<00:01:29.920> exactly<00:01:30.490> the<00:01:30.609> best<00:01:30.969> type<00:01:31.359> of

00:01:31.379 --> 00:01:31.389 
they're not exactly the best type of

00:01:31.389 --> 00:01:32.940 
they're not exactly the best type of
thing<00:01:31.689> that<00:01:31.899> you<00:01:32.139> want<00:01:32.289> to<00:01:32.409> see<00:01:32.619> from<00:01:32.799> a

00:01:32.940 --> 00:01:32.950 
thing that you want to see from a

00:01:32.950 --> 00:01:36.539 
thing that you want to see from a
quality<00:01:33.310> control<00:01:33.399> perspective<00:01:34.179> but<00:01:35.459> you<00:01:36.459> know

00:01:36.539 --> 00:01:36.549 
quality control perspective but you know

00:01:36.549 --> 00:01:38.760 
quality control perspective but you know
usually<00:01:36.939> watches<00:01:37.329> the<00:01:37.479> watch<00:01:38.170> companies<00:01:38.619> do

00:01:38.760 --> 00:01:38.770 
usually watches the watch companies do

00:01:38.770 --> 00:01:39.840 
usually watches the watch companies do
this<00:01:38.950> type<00:01:39.130> of<00:01:39.159> thing<00:01:39.310> where<00:01:39.520> they<00:01:39.609> have<00:01:39.639> these

00:01:39.840 --> 00:01:39.850 
this type of thing where they have these

00:01:39.850 --> 00:01:42.359 
this type of thing where they have these
processes<00:01:40.509> it's<00:01:41.109> not<00:01:41.289> very<00:01:41.560> industrial<00:01:42.189> as

00:01:42.359 --> 00:01:42.369
