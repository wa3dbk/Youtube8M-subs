this week's chapter kind of displayed
probably<00:00:16.529> one<00:00:16.740> of<00:00:16.770> the<00:00:16.980> only<00:00:17.189> problems<00:00:17.850> that<00:00:18.029> I

00:00:18.050 --> 00:00:18.060 
probably one of the only problems that I

00:00:18.060 --> 00:00:20.240 
probably one of the only problems that I
feel<00:00:18.390> the<00:00:18.540> one-piece<00:00:18.930> manga<00:00:19.380> has<00:00:19.590> and<00:00:19.950> that's

00:00:20.240 --> 00:00:20.250 
feel the one-piece manga has and that's

00:00:20.250 --> 00:00:22.609 
feel the one-piece manga has and that's
definitely<00:00:20.880> the<00:00:21.150> slow<00:00:21.420> pacing<00:00:21.750> and<00:00:22.380> those

00:00:22.609 --> 00:00:22.619 
definitely the slow pacing and those

00:00:22.619 --> 00:00:24.109 
definitely the slow pacing and those
chapters<00:00:22.920> where<00:00:23.250> it<00:00:23.340> feels<00:00:23.490> like<00:00:23.640> barely

fight again so there was really no

00:00:35.160 --> 00:00:36.560 
fight again so there was really no
progression<00:00:35.460> in<00:00:35.670> there<00:00:35.790> it<00:00:35.970> was<00:00:36.090> funny<00:00:36.360> in

00:00:36.560 --> 00:00:36.570 
progression in there it was funny in

progression in there it was funny in
this<00:00:36.660> chapter<00:00:37.019> was<00:00:37.140> pretty<00:00:37.440> fucking

this chapter was pretty fucking

00:00:37.860 --> 00:00:40.070 
this chapter was pretty fucking
hilarious<00:00:38.129> but<00:00:38.940> ultimately<00:00:39.390> the<00:00:39.600> progression

00:00:40.070 --> 00:00:40.080 
hilarious but ultimately the progression

00:00:40.080 --> 00:00:41.570 
hilarious but ultimately the progression
side<00:00:40.260> of<00:00:40.379> things<00:00:40.559> it<00:00:40.710> was<00:00:40.739> like<00:00:40.890> aside<00:00:41.430> from

00:00:41.570 --> 00:00:41.580 
side of things it was like aside from

00:00:41.580 --> 00:00:44.000 
side of things it was like aside from
like<00:00:41.730> a<00:00:41.760> revelation<00:00:42.269> and<00:00:42.769> Frankie<00:00:43.769> looking

badass that's really all we got with

00:00:45.449 --> 00:00:46.910 
badass that's really all we got with
this<00:00:45.570> chapter<00:00:45.960> it<00:00:46.080> was<00:00:46.229> like<00:00:46.350> it<00:00:46.530> was<00:00:46.680> funny

00:00:46.910 --> 00:00:46.920 
this chapter it was like it was funny

00:00:46.920 --> 00:00:49.369 
this chapter it was like it was funny
and<00:00:47.370> entertaining<00:00:47.640> but<00:00:48.600> we<00:00:48.989> didn't<00:00:49.260> really

00:00:49.369 --> 00:00:49.379 
and entertaining but we didn't really

00:00:49.379 --> 00:00:51.020 
and entertaining but we didn't really
cover<00:00:49.559> much<00:00:49.830> ground<00:00:49.860> and<00:00:50.370> I<00:00:50.460> mean<00:00:50.670> at<00:00:50.879> this

00:00:51.020 --> 00:00:51.030 
cover much ground and I mean at this

00:00:51.030 --> 00:00:53.000 
cover much ground and I mean at this
particular<00:00:51.210> point<00:00:51.629> how<00:00:51.960> fucking<00:00:52.470> long<00:00:52.650> is

00:00:53.000 --> 00:00:53.010 
particular point how fucking long is

00:00:53.010 --> 00:00:55.399 
particular point how fucking long is
Luffy<00:00:53.430> and<00:00:53.460> the<00:00:53.640> crew<00:00:53.850> going<00:00:54.479> to<00:00:54.720> the<00:00:54.839> castle<00:00:55.019> I

00:00:55.399 --> 00:00:55.409 
Luffy and the crew going to the castle I

00:00:55.409 --> 00:00:57.829 
Luffy and the crew going to the castle I
mean<00:00:55.650> the<00:00:56.309> pacing<00:00:56.850> I<00:00:57.089> noticed<00:00:57.510> recently

00:00:57.829 --> 00:00:57.839 
mean the pacing I noticed recently

00:00:57.839 --> 00:01:00.170 
mean the pacing I noticed recently
definitely<00:00:58.500> has<00:00:58.650> slowed<00:00:58.860> down<00:00:58.890> quite<00:00:59.460> a<00:00:59.640> bit

00:01:00.170 --> 00:01:00.180 
definitely has slowed down quite a bit

00:01:00.180 --> 00:01:01.700 
definitely has slowed down quite a bit
and<00:01:00.390> I<00:01:00.659> thought<00:01:00.809> well<00:01:00.930> as<00:01:01.080> we<00:01:01.260> shop<00:01:01.470> like<00:01:01.619> for

00:01:01.700 --> 00:01:01.710 
and I thought well as we shop like for

00:01:01.710 --> 00:01:03.289 
and I thought well as we shop like for
the<00:01:01.769> most<00:01:01.949> part<00:01:02.129> the<00:01:02.250> sorrel<00:01:02.519> vs.<00:01:02.790> Pico<00:01:03.119> fight

00:01:03.289 --> 00:01:03.299 
the most part the sorrel vs. Pico fight

00:01:03.299 --> 00:01:05.299 
the most part the sorrel vs. Pico fight
was<00:01:03.720> gonna<00:01:03.930> be<00:01:04.199> cutting<00:01:04.650> down<00:01:04.799> because<00:01:05.159> it

00:01:05.299 --> 00:01:05.309 
was gonna be cutting down because it

00:01:05.309 --> 00:01:06.560 
was gonna be cutting down because it
seemed<00:01:05.519> as<00:01:05.610> though<00:01:05.640> you<00:01:05.790> know<00:01:05.940> he<00:01:06.090> fucked<00:01:06.390> his

00:01:06.560 --> 00:01:06.570 
seemed as though you know he fucked his

00:01:06.570 --> 00:01:08.630 
seemed as though you know he fucked his
shit<00:01:06.600> up<00:01:06.900> and<00:01:07.020> I<00:01:07.080> thought<00:01:07.260> maybe<00:01:07.799> Zorro<00:01:08.250> would

00:01:08.630 --> 00:01:08.640 
shit up and I thought maybe Zorro would

00:01:08.640 --> 00:01:10.429 
shit up and I thought maybe Zorro would
like<00:01:09.060> take<00:01:09.360> him<00:01:09.510> out<00:01:09.630> in<00:01:09.780> the<00:01:09.869> next<00:01:10.110> chapter

00:01:10.429 --> 00:01:10.439 
like take him out in the next chapter

00:01:10.439 --> 00:01:12.170 
like take him out in the next chapter
pretty<00:01:10.950> easily<00:01:11.159> like<00:01:11.549> you<00:01:11.640> know<00:01:11.729> finish<00:01:11.909> him

00:01:12.170 --> 00:01:12.180 
pretty easily like you know finish him

00:01:12.180 --> 00:01:14.240 
pretty easily like you know finish him
off<00:01:12.390> but<00:01:13.049> it<00:01:13.200> seems<00:01:13.409> as<00:01:13.530> though<00:01:13.650> pikas<00:01:14.040> got<00:01:14.220> a

00:01:14.240 --> 00:01:14.250 
off but it seems as though pikas got a

00:01:14.250 --> 00:01:15.830 
off but it seems as though pikas got a
second<00:01:14.640> wind<00:01:14.790> and<00:01:14.880> it's<00:01:15.030> like<00:01:15.120> back<00:01:15.330> to<00:01:15.510> normal

00:01:27.650 --> 00:01:27.660 
and is ready to go so not that much

00:01:27.660 --> 00:01:29.360 
and is ready to go so not that much
ground<00:01:27.960> covered<00:01:28.440> we<00:01:28.620> got<00:01:28.770> that<00:01:28.920> conjured<00:01:29.280> oh

00:01:29.360 --> 00:01:29.370 
ground covered we got that conjured oh

00:01:29.370 --> 00:01:31.160 
ground covered we got that conjured oh
and<00:01:29.670> keenya<00:01:30.390> Mon<00:01:30.570> are<00:01:30.750> letting<00:01:31.020> those<00:01:31.110> people

00:01:31.160 --> 00:01:31.170 
and keenya Mon are letting those people

00:01:31.170 --> 00:01:34.130 
and keenya Mon are letting those people
go<00:01:31.590> down<00:01:31.860> so<00:01:32.370> I<00:01:32.610> guess<00:01:33.090> that's<00:01:33.300> one<00:01:33.930> of<00:01:34.050> the

00:01:34.130 --> 00:01:34.140 
go down so I guess that's one of the

00:01:34.140 --> 00:01:36.230 
go down so I guess that's one of the
only<00:01:34.560> big<00:01:35.010> progressions<00:01:35.640> I'd<00:01:35.760> say<00:01:35.970> we<00:01:36.120> have

00:03:01.220 --> 00:03:01.230 
way so that way the animate could

00:03:01.230 --> 00:03:03.410 
way so that way the animate could
incorporate<00:03:01.799> filler<00:03:02.280> into<00:03:02.580> these<00:03:02.850> bits<00:03:03.180> but

00:03:35.569 --> 00:03:35.579 
say this week's chapter one piece for

00:03:35.579 --> 00:03:36.949 
say this week's chapter one piece for
the<00:03:35.700> most<00:03:35.820> part<00:03:36.000> was<00:03:36.120> underwhelming<00:03:36.630> funny

00:03:36.949 --> 00:03:36.959 
the most part was underwhelming funny

00:03:36.959 --> 00:03:39.050 
the most part was underwhelming funny
but<00:03:37.260> that's<00:03:37.530> really<00:03:37.950> all<00:03:38.100> it<00:03:38.370> provided<00:03:38.880> and<00:03:39.000> I

00:03:39.050 --> 00:03:39.060 
but that's really all it provided and I

00:03:39.060 --> 00:03:41.180 
but that's really all it provided and I
really<00:03:39.359> hope<00:03:39.540> that<00:03:39.600> this<00:03:40.380> isn't<00:03:40.650> due<00:03:40.859> to<00:03:40.890> the

00:03:41.180 --> 00:03:41.190 
really hope that this isn't due to the

00:03:41.190 --> 00:03:43.160 
really hope that this isn't due to the
new<00:03:41.340> editor<00:03:41.670> that<00:03:41.850> oda<00:03:42.090> recently<00:03:42.600> got<00:03:42.750> i<00:03:42.930> think

00:03:43.160 --> 00:03:43.170 
new editor that oda recently got i think

00:03:43.170 --> 00:03:44.930 
new editor that oda recently got i think
he<00:03:43.290> paired<00:03:43.890> up<00:03:44.040> once<00:03:44.250> again<00:03:44.370> with<00:03:44.609> one<00:03:44.730> of<00:03:44.850> his

00:03:44.930 --> 00:03:44.940 
he paired up once again with one of his

00:03:44.940 --> 00:03:47.390 
he paired up once again with one of his
old<00:03:45.209> editors<00:03:45.660> and<00:03:45.930> while<00:03:46.410> it's<00:03:46.859> cool<00:03:47.100> to<00:03:47.250> have

00:03:47.390 --> 00:03:47.400 
old editors and while it's cool to have

00:03:47.400 --> 00:03:48.979 
old editors and while it's cool to have
some<00:03:47.579> entertainment<00:03:47.790> things<00:03:48.690> should<00:03:48.959> be

00:03:48.979 --> 00:03:48.989 
some entertainment things should be

00:03:48.989 --> 00:03:50.690 
some entertainment things should be
happening<00:03:49.109> while<00:03:49.829> things<00:03:50.160> that's<00:03:50.340> going<00:03:50.519> on

00:03:50.690 --> 00:03:50.700 
happening while things that's going on

00:03:50.700 --> 00:03:52.370 
happening while things that's going on
and<00:03:50.970> it<00:03:51.030> shouldn't<00:03:51.299> just<00:03:51.329> be<00:03:51.510> like<00:03:51.720> all<00:03:51.930> played

00:03:52.370 --> 00:03:52.380 
and it shouldn't just be like all played

00:03:52.380 --> 00:03:54.229 
and it shouldn't just be like all played
up<00:03:52.530> for<00:03:52.739> a<00:03:52.769> laugh<00:03:53.010> so<00:03:53.280> i<00:03:53.430> hope<00:03:53.790> this<00:03:53.970> isn't<00:03:54.150> the

00:03:54.229 --> 00:03:54.239 
up for a laugh so i hope this isn't the

00:03:54.239 --> 00:03:55.580 
up for a laugh so i hope this isn't the
direction<00:03:54.720> that<00:03:54.810> its<00:03:54.959> editors<00:03:55.319> trying<00:03:55.530> to

direction that its editors trying to

00:03:55.590 --> 00:03:56.809 
direction that its editors trying to
take<00:03:55.739> them<00:03:55.889> like<00:03:56.040> yeah<00:03:56.400> we're<00:03:56.519> gonna<00:03:56.609> have

00:04:06.410 --> 00:04:06.420 
fall a little bit further behind from

00:04:06.420 --> 00:04:08.210 
fall a little bit further behind from
the<00:04:06.569> manga<00:04:06.959> stuff<00:04:07.170> like<00:04:07.319> that<00:04:07.470> i<00:04:07.500> really<00:04:08.069> hope

00:04:08.210 --> 00:04:08.220 
the manga stuff like that i really hope

00:04:08.220 --> 00:04:09.949 
the manga stuff like that i really hope
that's<00:04:08.370> not<00:04:08.489> the<00:04:08.609> case<00:04:08.730> because<00:04:09.030> this<00:04:09.540> chapter

00:04:09.949 --> 00:04:09.959 
that's not the case because this chapter

00:04:09.959 --> 00:04:12.170 
that's not the case because this chapter
was<00:04:10.109> like<00:04:10.260> not<00:04:11.069> much<00:04:11.280> happened<00:04:11.760> someone<00:04:12.090> give

00:04:12.170 --> 00:04:12.180 
was like not much happened someone give

00:04:12.180 --> 00:04:13.520 
was like not much happened someone give
us<00:04:12.299> one<00:04:12.389> like<00:04:12.510> a<00:04:12.540> three<00:04:12.810> out<00:04:12.959> of<00:04:12.989> ten<00:04:13.260> for<00:04:13.470> the

00:04:13.520 --> 00:04:13.530 
us one like a three out of ten for the

00:04:13.530 --> 00:04:15.319 
us one like a three out of ten for the
most<00:04:13.709> part<00:04:13.980> it<00:04:14.220> did<00:04:14.639> have<00:04:14.910> the<00:04:15.090> little

00:04:15.319 --> 00:04:15.329 
most part it did have the little

00:04:15.329 --> 00:04:17.479 
most part it did have the little
revelation<00:04:16.019> with<00:04:16.169> man<00:04:16.380> Shetty<00:04:16.739> and<00:04:17.039> the

00:04:17.479 --> 00:04:17.489 
revelation with man Shetty and the

00:04:17.489 --> 00:04:19.969 
revelation with man Shetty and the
Frankie<00:04:17.789> stuff<00:04:18.030> was<00:04:18.180> funny<00:04:18.419> but<00:04:18.750> yeah<00:04:19.320> we

00:04:19.969 --> 00:04:19.979 
Frankie stuff was funny but yeah we

00:04:19.979 --> 00:04:21.349 
Frankie stuff was funny but yeah we
definitely<00:04:20.400> need<00:04:20.549> a<00:04:20.579> lot<00:04:20.789> more<00:04:21.000> than<00:04:21.150> that<00:04:21.239> and

00:04:21.349 --> 00:04:21.359 
definitely need a lot more than that and

00:04:21.359 --> 00:04:22.850 
definitely need a lot more than that and
this<00:04:21.450> is<00:04:21.570> very<00:04:21.600> similar<00:04:22.079> to<00:04:22.289> the<00:04:22.470> chapter<00:04:22.770> that

00:04:22.850 --> 00:04:22.860 
this is very similar to the chapter that
