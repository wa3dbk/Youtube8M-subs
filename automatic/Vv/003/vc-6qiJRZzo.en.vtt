00:00:07.200 --> 00:00:15.139
 Yes, it will be Muramatsu coach 's forehand chance ball hit today 

00:00:20.470 --> 00:00:32.680
 Relative to the ball, which flies ze so that you are wearing a Tokiki of Muramatsu coach chance ball 

00:00:27.009 --> 00:00:35.710
 Of course I would like to hit with a high hit point but at that time it was too early to drop the ball 

00:00:32.680 --> 00:00:40.809
 If it is too much, it will easily get clogged 

00:00:35.710 --> 00:00:45.790
 If anything , just wait behind the ball and at your own timing from behind 

00:00:40.809 --> 00:00:48.190
 I think it would be very easy to convey the power if you hit while entering 

00:00:45.790 --> 00:00:52.380
 I hope you see it there 

00:00:48.190 --> 00:00:56.750
 When preparing a racket against the shaven 

00:00:52.380 --> 00:01:02.060
 From the top or from the back or that kind of color 

00:00:56.750 --> 00:01:02.710
 It's white , so I can hit with a high hit point, so if you say either, there is also a side from the front side 

00:01:02.060 --> 00:01:06.650
 but 

00:01:02.710 --> 00:01:10.820
 It's like setting it up high and letting it swing straight out as it is 

00:01:06.650 --> 00:01:14.000
 Hit school and be in common under the guidance jar that Eto 

00:01:10.820 --> 00:01:17.780
 Much more behind and in front of 

00:01:14.000 --> 00:01:22.750
 I'm thinking of waving straight , so I won't drop my head too much 

00:01:17.780 --> 00:01:22.750
 Let's go and let's go 

00:01:41.310 --> 00:01:47.940
 It is one of batting points 10 -1 

00:01:44.909 --> 00:01:50.630
 I think it's quite a while ago 

00:01:47.940 --> 00:01:50.630
 2 

00:02:04.370 --> 00:02:09.840
 me 

00:02:06.970 --> 00:02:09.840
 Yeah yeah yeah 

00:02:14.170 --> 00:02:16.920
 me 

00:02:19.720 --> 00:02:23.660
 me 

00:02:20.590 --> 00:02:29.500
 Hamamatsu Kochi finally 

00:02:23.660 --> 00:02:29.500
 Those pretty people who are not good at chance balls 

00:02:29.710 --> 00:02:38.760
 I think that there are a lot of people who are not good at it or who do not like 

00:02:35.710 --> 00:02:40.620
 Keep this alone 

00:02:38.760 --> 00:02:42.790
 Cat 

00:02:40.620 --> 00:02:49.500
 At the time of chance ball 

00:02:42.790 --> 00:02:49.500
 I think it's important that you move your feet into the family and where to put the ball firmly 

00:02:50.490 --> 00:02:59.100
 Rotation too much dropped a little racket head at Boo Boo chance Paul Ati 

00:02:55.620 --> 00:03:03.660
 Oh, I'm going to lose that kind of beautiful ball 

00:02:59.100 --> 00:03:11.210
 Firmly put in here from behind and shake it forward 

00:03:03.660 --> 00:03:15.710
 I think you can launch a boo-boo launch to connect the meaning you can 

00:03:11.210 --> 00:03:18.100
 Well then let's do our best to take care of that there yes more than yes 

00:03:15.710 --> 00:03:18.100
