okay<00:00:02.399> here's<00:00:02.580> video<00:00:02.760> number<00:00:02.970> two<00:00:03.240> for<00:00:04.140> James

00:00:04.430 --> 00:00:04.440 
okay here's video number two for James

00:00:04.440 --> 00:00:07.190 
okay here's video number two for James
we've<00:00:05.190> got<00:00:05.400> the<00:00:05.549> ableton<00:00:06.000> plugin<00:00:06.540> uploaded

00:00:07.190 --> 00:00:07.200 
we've got the ableton plugin uploaded

00:00:07.200 --> 00:00:09.740 
we've got the ableton plugin uploaded
and<00:00:07.849> what<00:00:08.849> we're<00:00:08.940> going<00:00:08.970> to<00:00:09.150> do<00:00:09.269> now<00:00:09.420> is<00:00:09.599> we're

00:00:09.740 --> 00:00:09.750 
and what we're going to do now is we're

00:00:09.750 --> 00:00:12.049 
and what we're going to do now is we're
going<00:00:09.840> to<00:00:09.960> actually<00:00:10.110> look<00:00:10.790> this<00:00:11.790> is<00:00:11.940> the

00:00:12.049 --> 00:00:12.059 
going to actually look this is the

00:00:12.059 --> 00:00:13.759 
going to actually look this is the
plug-in<00:00:12.450> and<00:00:12.660> you<00:00:12.960> can<00:00:13.170> see<00:00:13.410> the<00:00:13.590> outside

00:00:13.759 --> 00:00:13.769 
plug-in and you can see the outside

00:00:13.769 --> 00:00:15.289 
plug-in and you can see the outside
these<00:00:14.280> numbers<00:00:14.700> here<00:00:14.730> this<00:00:15.150> is<00:00:15.269> the

00:00:15.289 --> 00:00:15.299 
these numbers here this is the

00:00:15.299 --> 00:00:17.900 
these numbers here this is the
resolution<00:00:15.929> count<00:00:16.440> on<00:00:16.560> the<00:00:16.650> platter<00:00:16.890> this<00:00:17.730> is

00:00:17.900 --> 00:00:17.910 
resolution count on the platter this is

00:00:17.910 --> 00:00:20.810 
resolution count on the platter this is
the<00:00:18.090> speed<00:00:18.449> and<00:00:18.890> around<00:00:19.890> here<00:00:20.310> is<00:00:20.490> a<00:00:20.520> little

00:00:20.810 --> 00:00:20.820 
the speed and around here is a little

00:00:20.820 --> 00:00:23.269 
the speed and around here is a little
highlight<00:00:21.630> if<00:00:22.230> you<00:00:22.380> can<00:00:22.529> see<00:00:22.740> it<00:00:22.890> real<00:00:23.039> well

00:00:23.269 --> 00:00:23.279 
highlight if you can see it real well

00:00:23.279 --> 00:00:26.000 
highlight if you can see it real well
when<00:00:23.910> you<00:00:24.060> scratch<00:00:24.539> that<00:00:25.320> highlight<00:00:25.800> will

00:00:26.000 --> 00:00:26.010 
when you scratch that highlight will

00:00:26.010 --> 00:00:30.470 
when you scratch that highlight will
turn<00:00:26.220> red<00:00:26.630> and<00:00:27.630> when<00:00:28.619> you<00:00:28.800> pitch<00:00:29.130> bend<00:00:29.480> the

00:00:30.470 --> 00:00:30.480 
turn red and when you pitch bend the

00:00:30.480 --> 00:00:33.830 
turn red and when you pitch bend the
highlight<00:00:30.929> turns<00:00:31.199> blue<00:00:31.910> now<00:00:32.910> I've<00:00:33.239> also<00:00:33.450> got

00:00:33.830 --> 00:00:33.840 
highlight turns blue now I've also got

00:00:33.840 --> 00:00:37.250 
highlight turns blue now I've also got
the<00:00:34.020> command<00:00:34.410> line<00:00:34.559> app<00:00:35.550> here<00:00:36.030> so<00:00:36.930> that<00:00:37.110> you

00:00:37.250 --> 00:00:37.260 
the command line app here so that you

00:00:37.260 --> 00:00:39.770 
the command line app here so that you
can<00:00:37.440> actually<00:00:37.620> see<00:00:38.090> when<00:00:39.090> there's<00:00:39.270> a<00:00:39.360> scratch

00:00:39.770 --> 00:00:39.780 
can actually see when there's a scratch

00:00:39.780 --> 00:00:43.510 
can actually see when there's a scratch
message<00:00:40.320> and<00:00:41.309> when<00:00:41.579> there's<00:00:41.820> a<00:00:41.879> finger<00:00:42.300> bang<00:00:42.510> a

00:00:43.510 --> 00:00:43.520 
message and when there's a finger bang a

00:00:43.520 --> 00:00:49.190 
message and when there's a finger bang a
pitch<00:00:44.520> Bend<00:00:45.469> so<00:00:47.690> again<00:00:48.690> I'm<00:00:48.809> going<00:00:48.899> to<00:00:49.020> pull

00:00:49.190 --> 00:00:49.200 
pitch Bend so again I'm going to pull

00:00:49.200 --> 00:00:53.080 
pitch Bend so again I'm going to pull
out<00:00:49.230> here<00:00:49.680> so<00:00:49.860> you<00:00:49.950> can<00:00:50.219> see<00:00:50.250> what's<00:00:50.700> up

00:00:53.080 --> 00:00:53.090 

00:00:53.090 --> 00:00:55.279 

hopefully<00:00:54.090> you<00:00:54.210> guys<00:00:54.390> are<00:00:54.600> getting<00:00:54.690> an<00:00:54.930> idea

00:00:55.279 --> 00:00:55.289 
hopefully you guys are getting an idea

00:00:55.289 --> 00:01:00.049 
hopefully you guys are getting an idea
of<00:00:55.710> what's<00:00:56.309> happening<00:00:56.760> here<00:00:57.920> and<00:00:59.030> what<00:01:00.030> I'm

00:01:00.049 --> 00:01:00.059 
of what's happening here and what I'm

00:01:00.059 --> 00:01:01.310 
of what's happening here and what I'm
going<00:01:00.149> to<00:01:00.270> do<00:01:00.420> is<00:01:00.539> I'm<00:01:00.690> just<00:01:00.719> going<00:01:00.899> to<00:01:01.079> show

00:01:01.310 --> 00:01:01.320 
going to do is I'm just going to show

00:01:01.320 --> 00:01:04.690 
going to do is I'm just going to show
you<00:01:01.430> how<00:01:02.430> sensitive<00:01:02.760> this<00:01:03.180> is<00:01:03.420> you'll<00:01:03.750> see

00:01:04.690 --> 00:01:04.700 
you how sensitive this is you'll see

00:01:04.700 --> 00:01:09.170 
you how sensitive this is you'll see
here<00:01:06.049> this<00:01:07.049> move<00:01:07.409> when<00:01:08.280> a<00:01:08.310> pitch<00:01:08.610> Bend<00:01:08.850> message

00:01:09.170 --> 00:01:09.180 
here this move when a pitch Bend message

00:01:09.180 --> 00:01:27.640 
here this move when a pitch Bend message
is<00:01:09.330> sent

00:01:27.640 --> 00:01:27.650 

00:01:27.650 --> 00:01:35.000 

so<00:01:28.650> as<00:01:28.979> you<00:01:29.010> can<00:01:29.400> see<00:01:29.760> I<00:01:32.900> can<00:01:33.900> speed<00:01:34.590> up<00:01:34.620> or<00:01:34.950> slow

00:01:35.000 --> 00:01:35.010 
so as you can see I can speed up or slow

00:01:35.010 --> 00:01:39.100 
so as you can see I can speed up or slow
down<00:01:35.220> the<00:01:35.550> platter<00:01:36.890> extremely<00:01:37.890> responsive<00:01:38.790> to

00:01:39.100 --> 00:01:39.110 
down the platter extremely responsive to

00:01:39.110 --> 00:01:41.990 
down the platter extremely responsive to
even<00:01:40.110> the<00:01:40.260> lightest<00:01:40.740> rags<00:01:41.070> around<00:01:41.460> the<00:01:41.880> edge

00:01:41.990 --> 00:01:42.000 
even the lightest rags around the edge

00:01:42.000 --> 00:01:56.719 
even the lightest rags around the edge
of<00:01:42.150> the<00:01:42.270> platter<00:01:55.130> and<00:01:56.130> of<00:01:56.280> course<00:01:56.520> the

00:01:56.719 --> 00:01:56.729 
of the platter and of course the

00:01:56.729 --> 00:02:00.279 
of the platter and of course the
sensitivity<00:01:57.509> is<00:01:57.600> adjustable<00:01:58.850> inside<00:01:59.850> of<00:02:00.000> our

00:02:00.279 --> 00:02:00.289 
sensitivity is adjustable inside of our

00:02:00.289 --> 00:02:02.420 
sensitivity is adjustable inside of our
duronto<00:02:01.289> application<00:02:01.950> in<00:02:02.100> the<00:02:02.130> platter

00:02:02.420 --> 00:02:02.430 
duronto application in the platter

00:02:02.430 --> 00:02:04.639 
duronto application in the platter
settings<00:02:02.910> you<00:02:03.750> can<00:02:03.780> click<00:02:04.080> the<00:02:04.229> options

00:02:04.639 --> 00:02:04.649 
settings you can click the options

00:02:04.649 --> 00:02:08.240 
settings you can click the options
button<00:02:04.740> underneath<00:02:05.369> the<00:02:05.580> platter<00:02:05.850> and<00:02:07.250> it

00:02:08.240 --> 00:02:08.250 
button underneath the platter and it

00:02:08.250 --> 00:02:10.160 
button underneath the platter and it
will<00:02:08.399> give<00:02:08.550> you<00:02:08.729> some<00:02:09.209> settings<00:02:09.720> to<00:02:09.810> adjust

00:02:10.160 --> 00:02:10.170 
will give you some settings to adjust

00:02:10.170 --> 00:02:15.140 
will give you some settings to adjust
the<00:02:10.649> threshold<00:02:10.860> for<00:02:11.400> that<00:02:12.980> so<00:02:13.980> again<00:02:14.760> you<00:02:14.940> can

00:02:15.140 --> 00:02:15.150 
the threshold for that so again you can

00:02:15.150 --> 00:02:18.650 
the threshold for that so again you can
see<00:02:15.360> that<00:02:15.390> the<00:02:16.519> the<00:02:17.519> hardware<00:02:17.880> itself<00:02:18.150> is

00:02:18.650 --> 00:02:18.660 
see that the the hardware itself is

00:02:18.660 --> 00:02:21.530 
see that the the hardware itself is
actually<00:02:19.410> sending<00:02:20.100> the<00:02:20.250> data<00:02:20.280> the<00:02:20.970> problem<00:02:21.330> is

00:02:21.530 --> 00:02:21.540 
actually sending the data the problem is

00:02:21.540 --> 00:02:23.810 
actually sending the data the problem is
right<00:02:22.290> now<00:02:22.350> in<00:02:23.100> the<00:02:23.280> case<00:02:23.430> of<00:02:23.459> pitchblende

00:02:23.810 --> 00:02:23.820 
right now in the case of pitchblende

00:02:23.820 --> 00:02:25.970 
right now in the case of pitchblende
specifically<00:02:24.660> that<00:02:24.900> the<00:02:25.470> message<00:02:25.800> isn't

00:02:25.970 --> 00:02:25.980 
specifically that the message isn't

00:02:25.980 --> 00:02:28.220 
specifically that the message isn't
there<00:02:26.280> to<00:02:26.310> fully<00:02:26.790> support<00:02:27.180> it<00:02:27.300> now<00:02:27.900> what<00:02:28.080> we've

00:02:28.220 --> 00:02:28.230 
there to fully support it now what we've

00:02:28.230 --> 00:02:31.070 
there to fully support it now what we've
tried<00:02:28.440> doing<00:02:28.709> is<00:02:29.040> a<00:02:29.070> mapping<00:02:29.910> toward<00:02:30.360> the<00:02:30.660> CD

00:02:31.070 --> 00:02:31.080 
tried doing is a mapping toward the CD

00:02:31.080 --> 00:02:34.490 
tried doing is a mapping toward the CD
DJ<00:02:31.530> message<00:02:32.090> it<00:02:33.090> didn't<00:02:33.780> really<00:02:33.900> work<00:02:34.019> out<00:02:34.320> the

00:02:34.490 --> 00:02:34.500 
DJ message it didn't really work out the

00:02:34.500 --> 00:02:37.190 
DJ message it didn't really work out the
way<00:02:34.590> we<00:02:34.620> wanted<00:02:34.980> it<00:02:35.070> to<00:02:35.630> you<00:02:36.630> know<00:02:36.750> one<00:02:37.019> of<00:02:37.049> the

00:02:37.190 --> 00:02:37.200 
way we wanted it to you know one of the

00:02:37.200 --> 00:02:39.199 
way we wanted it to you know one of the
things<00:02:37.380> we<00:02:37.500> could<00:02:37.680> map<00:02:37.860> to<00:02:38.100> is<00:02:38.459> actually<00:02:39.000> the

00:02:39.199 --> 00:02:39.209 
things we could map to is actually the

00:02:39.209 --> 00:02:43.520 
things we could map to is actually the
phase<00:02:39.510> sink<00:02:40.880> and<00:02:41.880> and<00:02:42.570> the<00:02:42.840> problem<00:02:43.200> with<00:02:43.350> that

00:02:43.520 --> 00:02:43.530 
phase sink and and the problem with that

00:02:43.530 --> 00:02:45.800 
phase sink and and the problem with that
although<00:02:43.920> it<00:02:44.280> works<00:02:44.549> better<00:02:44.850> performance

00:02:45.800 --> 00:02:45.810 
although it works better performance

00:02:45.810 --> 00:02:48.050 
although it works better performance
wise<00:02:45.989> there's<00:02:46.829> some<00:02:47.040> audio<00:02:47.340> artifacts<00:02:47.790> when

00:02:48.050 --> 00:02:48.060 
wise there's some audio artifacts when

00:02:48.060 --> 00:02:49.490 
wise there's some audio artifacts when
you<00:02:48.180> try<00:02:48.390> manipulating<00:02:49.019> that<00:02:49.140> and<00:02:49.380> that's

00:02:49.490 --> 00:02:49.500 
you try manipulating that and that's

00:02:49.500 --> 00:02:50.630 
you try manipulating that and that's
something<00:02:49.680> you<00:02:49.860> can<00:02:50.040> do<00:02:50.190> inside<00:02:50.489> the

00:02:50.630 --> 00:02:50.640 
something you can do inside the

00:02:50.640 --> 00:02:52.340 
something you can do inside the
application<00:02:51.150> here<00:02:51.390> for<00:02:51.600> yourself<00:02:51.959> just<00:02:52.049> try

00:02:52.340 --> 00:02:52.350 
application here for yourself just try

00:02:52.350 --> 00:02:53.780 
application here for yourself just try
it<00:02:52.380> manipulating<00:02:52.980> that<00:02:53.070> they<00:02:53.220> sync<00:02:53.519> with<00:02:53.670> the

00:02:53.780 --> 00:02:53.790 
it manipulating that they sync with the

00:02:53.790 --> 00:02:57.009 
it manipulating that they sync with the
mouse<00:02:55.130> so<00:02:56.130> right<00:02:56.340> now<00:02:56.370> we're<00:02:56.670> just<00:02:56.700> waiting

00:02:57.009 --> 00:02:57.019 
mouse so right now we're just waiting

00:02:57.019 --> 00:03:01.370 
mouse so right now we're just waiting
but<00:02:58.019> again<00:03:00.079> demonstrating<00:03:01.079> that<00:03:01.110> the

00:03:01.370 --> 00:03:01.380 
but again demonstrating that the

00:03:01.380 --> 00:03:04.490 
but again demonstrating that the
hardware<00:03:02.010> is<00:03:02.190> capable<00:03:02.930> it's<00:03:03.930> just<00:03:04.200> waiting

00:03:04.490 --> 00:03:04.500 
hardware is capable it's just waiting

00:03:04.500 --> 00:03:07.039 
hardware is capable it's just waiting
for<00:03:04.680> software<00:03:05.100> to<00:03:05.220> catch<00:03:05.400> up<00:03:05.610> I<00:03:05.870> hope<00:03:06.870> that

00:03:07.039 --> 00:03:07.049 
for software to catch up I hope that

00:03:07.049 --> 00:03:10.400 
for software to catch up I hope that
helps<00:03:07.350> answer<00:03:07.769> some<00:03:08.010> questions
