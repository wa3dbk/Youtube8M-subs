00:00:07.360 --> 00:00:09.600
 g 

00:00:13.030 --> 00:00:18.770
 good evening london let's try to see 

00:00:16.460 --> 00:00:21.470
 together with air if better taken 

00:00:18.770 --> 00:00:27.170
 carbohydrates during the day 

00:00:21.470 --> 00:00:30.680
 or in the evening it is common thinking to think 

00:00:27.170 --> 00:00:33.200
 that it is better not to take them for dinner 

00:00:30.680 --> 00:00:35.510
 this mainly for two reasons 

00:00:33.200 --> 00:00:38.090
 first because if we eat them 

00:00:35.510 --> 00:00:40.300
 before going to bed more easily 

00:00:38.090 --> 00:00:45.170
 they will settle like stocks of fat 

00:00:40.300 --> 00:00:48.080
 the second because an evening introduction 

00:00:45.170 --> 00:00:50.480
 of carbohydrates leads to dampen the 

00:00:48.080 --> 00:00:51.920
 small shift of ch 

00:00:50.480 --> 00:00:54.710
 actually all these two 

00:00:51.920 --> 00:00:58.130
 considerations are not exact we look for 

00:00:54.710 --> 00:01:00.170
 to understand why they are mistakenly thought 

00:00:58.130 --> 00:01:03.260
 that shuts off energy given 

00:01:00.170 --> 00:01:06.409
 from the activity is as low as possible in 

00:01:03.260 --> 00:01:08.150
 three days I really love there is not one 

00:01:06.409 --> 00:01:10.700
 big difference between a job 

00:01:08.150 --> 00:01:13.250
 sedentary between sitting on a 

00:01:10.700 --> 00:01:17.090
 desk at school or in a chair in front of 

00:01:13.250 --> 00:01:19.880
 a desk and sleep among other things 

00:01:17.090 --> 00:01:21.640
 the night before we fall asleep we have 

00:01:19.880 --> 00:01:25.010
 a surge of thyroid hormones 

00:01:21.640 --> 00:01:26.510
 so clearly he does not switch them off though 

00:01:25.010 --> 00:01:29.150
 we must choose whether to eat 

00:01:26.510 --> 00:01:31.750
 carbohydrates during the day or at 

00:01:29.150 --> 00:01:34.909
 evening energy expenditure 

00:01:31.750 --> 00:01:37.909
 activity is not as relevant as from 

00:01:34.909 --> 00:01:40.430
 induce a choice 32 

00:01:37.909 --> 00:01:42.290
 we all know that ch is a hormone of 

00:01:40.430 --> 00:01:44.720
 political useful for weight loss 

00:01:42.290 --> 00:01:48.170
 therefore we try to raise it in a way 

00:01:44.720 --> 00:01:51.830
 natural to preserve nocturnal peaks 

00:01:48.170 --> 00:01:54.770
 but we begin to ask ourselves why we have 

00:01:51.830 --> 00:01:56.479
 the small shift if we understand the 

00:01:54.770 --> 00:01:58.000
 because we know how to give us also 

00:01:56.479 --> 00:02:01.430
 explanations 

00:01:58.000 --> 00:02:06.080
 the first thing we can say is that 

00:02:01.430 --> 00:02:08.840
 the most obese women ch rig diabetics 

00:02:06.080 --> 00:02:13.909
 a normal man yet they are all the more 

00:02:08.840 --> 00:02:17.569
 fats therefore high levels of gh non 

00:02:13.909 --> 00:02:19.510
 equals to be more seas the gh is a 

00:02:17.569 --> 00:02:22.510
 leading cofactor 

00:02:19.510 --> 00:02:26.739
 floor but it is only a dot in 

00:02:22.510 --> 00:02:29.680
 together our body seeks to 

00:02:26.739 --> 00:02:33.640
 keep your own three states 

00:02:29.680 --> 00:02:38.530
 vital parameters there is blood glucose us 

00:02:33.640 --> 00:02:42.190
 we eat in the evening the blood sugar rises and 

00:02:38.530 --> 00:02:45.159
 subsequently falls drops down for 

00:02:42.190 --> 00:02:48.099
 preserve it less sugar is 

00:02:45.159 --> 00:02:51.909
 his body is more available 

00:02:48.099 --> 00:02:54.340
 metabolism on fat consumption 

00:02:51.909 --> 00:02:59.019
 what is one of the hormones it allows 

00:02:54.340 --> 00:03:03.040
 this the ch for this gh stands up 

00:02:59.019 --> 00:03:05.730
 night to help us preserve the most 

00:03:03.040 --> 00:03:11.349
 Possible sugars to deliver less 

00:03:05.730 --> 00:03:15.190
 but what happens if we eat in the evening 

00:03:11.349 --> 00:03:16.959
 a nice big plate of pasta there 

00:03:15.190 --> 00:03:19.829
 we eat sweets so we have a 

00:03:16.959 --> 00:03:23.709
 insulin peak and then hypoglycemia 

00:03:19.829 --> 00:03:26.440
 reactive that gh stimulation will be 

00:03:23.709 --> 00:03:29.829
 even more evident because when 

00:03:26.440 --> 00:03:32.099
 sugars will collapse the body will have 

00:03:29.829 --> 00:03:34.829
 even more need to sustain itself 

00:03:32.099 --> 00:03:38.889
 taking advantage of lipid metabolism 

00:03:34.829 --> 00:03:41.010
 as you can see the factors are many 

00:03:38.889 --> 00:03:43.959
 if we can understand the principle 

00:03:41.010 --> 00:03:46.989
 we also understand the effects that 

00:03:43.959 --> 00:03:49.569
 causes in our body 

00:03:46.989 --> 00:03:53.099
 eating carbohydrates at dinner has many 

00:03:49.569 --> 00:03:56.949
 advantages the primis increases the levels 

00:03:53.099 --> 00:03:59.169
 Latin daily a lot hormone 

00:03:56.949 --> 00:04:01.120
 important for slimming we do not 

00:03:59.169 --> 00:04:03.459
 I marry only at night but we must 

00:04:01.120 --> 00:04:07.060
 see over the 24 hours the 

00:04:03.459 --> 00:04:09.310
 general budget as another point 

00:04:07.060 --> 00:04:11.650
 important is what improves the 

00:04:09.310 --> 00:04:13.780
 sleep the best through one 

00:04:11.650 --> 00:04:17.889
 increased serotonin production 

00:04:13.780 --> 00:04:20.980
 let's try to understand how it works more 

00:04:17.889 --> 00:04:23.440
 chair we introduce more gets up 

00:04:20.980 --> 00:04:27.040
 More blood sugar in response should get up 

00:04:23.440 --> 00:04:29.470
 insulin insulin what it does or 

00:04:27.040 --> 00:04:31.780
 won cell milk so ours 

00:04:29.470 --> 00:04:34.990
 cells manage to capture that 

00:04:31.780 --> 00:04:36.850
 Easily amino acids and glucose all 

00:04:34.990 --> 00:04:39.240
 amino acids enter except 

00:04:36.850 --> 00:04:39.240
 tryptophan 

00:04:39.250 --> 00:04:44.530
 thus the blood levels of tryptophan 

00:04:41.700 --> 00:04:47.800
 remain higher than the others 

00:04:44.530 --> 00:04:50.350
 amino acids and at the barrier level 

00:04:47.800 --> 00:04:53.080
 hematoencephalic manages to pass more 

00:04:50.350 --> 00:04:56.350
 easily because it knows no amino acids 

00:04:53.080 --> 00:04:58.630
 tryptophan antagonists in ours 

00:04:56.350 --> 00:05:01.090
 central nervous system becomes 

00:04:58.630 --> 00:05:04.380
 serotonin which in turn becomes 

00:05:01.090 --> 00:05:07.600
 essential melatonin to provide well 

00:05:04.380 --> 00:05:08.770
 so ultimately air what 

00:05:07.600 --> 00:05:10.530
 we must do we must eat 

00:05:08.770 --> 00:05:14.080
 carbohydrates in the evening 

00:05:10.530 --> 00:05:17.380
 no all we said up 

00:05:14.080 --> 00:05:19.690
 now they are bullshit or at least 

00:05:17.380 --> 00:05:22.930
 they are not so important compared to a 

00:05:19.690 --> 00:05:25.540
 another factor what determines 

00:05:22.930 --> 00:05:29.200
 when to eat mainly i 

00:05:25.540 --> 00:05:31.270
 carbohydrates and training indeed 

00:05:29.200 --> 00:05:34.479
 finished training our stocks 

00:05:31.270 --> 00:05:38.800
 the coach is not energetic 

00:05:34.479 --> 00:05:40.810
 muscle and bass and the following meal 

00:05:38.800 --> 00:05:44.640
 the workout must be that 

00:05:40.810 --> 00:05:47.800
 mainly glucidic in this way 

00:05:44.640 --> 00:05:49.660
 good insulin sensitivity and 

00:05:47.800 --> 00:05:52.000
 glycogen based stocks ci 

00:05:49.660 --> 00:05:54.220
 will ensure that the sugars 

00:05:52.000 --> 00:05:57.850
 introduced will not be converted to 3d 

00:05:54.220 --> 00:06:00.910
 ceredi will allow us the carbohydrates of 

00:05:57.850 --> 00:06:03.100
 recover first and end the 

00:06:00.910 --> 00:06:04.110
 kata phase bolic appreciate that 

00:06:03.100 --> 00:06:07.330
 analog 

00:06:04.110 --> 00:06:09.210
 moral of the story when we look 

00:06:07.330 --> 00:06:11.370
 to hormones 

00:06:09.210 --> 00:06:12.500
 how they affect our composition 

00:06:11.370 --> 00:06:15.410
 corporeal 

00:06:12.500 --> 00:06:18.360
 we must also observe to the teeth 

00:06:15.410 --> 00:06:21.150
 macroscopic that go to influence in 

00:06:18.360 --> 00:06:24.830
 even more relevant on the 

00:06:21.150 --> 00:06:24.830
 biochemical functions in our body 

00:06:24.840 --> 00:06:29.729
 one last point is true if not 

00:06:28.080 --> 00:06:32.280
 we eat carbohydrates 

00:06:29.729 --> 00:06:35.699
 in the following hours of training the 

00:06:32.280 --> 00:06:38.789
 our body consumes more fat and therefore 

00:06:35.699 --> 00:06:40.919
 in the short period of Marian more but 

00:06:38.789 --> 00:06:44.400
 also true that keep stocks 

00:06:40.919 --> 00:06:46.860
 low energy without carbohydrates in the 

00:06:44.400 --> 00:06:48.690
 long period will lead to better 

00:06:46.860 --> 00:06:51.690
 nice swing but also a 

00:06:48.690 --> 00:06:53.570
 insulin resistance then when 

00:06:51.690 --> 00:06:56.849
 we touch on food strategies 

00:06:53.570 --> 00:06:59.120
 we must have a look in the long run 

00:06:56.849 --> 00:06:59.120
 period
