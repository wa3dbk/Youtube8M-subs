00:00:00.470 --> 00:00:10.100
 You thought you saw it all, you're very 

00:00:03.770 --> 00:00:15.970
 wrong because in a few seconds more 

00:00:10.100 --> 00:00:15.970
 you will live a unique experience 

00:00:28.960 --> 00:00:32.500
 good people 

00:00:34.020 --> 00:00:39.390
 here generate tagline in another new 

00:00:36.570 --> 00:00:42.030
 video in this case I'm going to teach another 

00:00:39.390 --> 00:00:45.540
 guide how it would have been up for 

00:00:42.030 --> 00:00:49.130
 kill you're but with the group and with 

00:00:45.540 --> 00:00:50.840
 the hunter who is also super easy 

00:00:49.130 --> 00:00:54.530
 sometimes everyone has to know 

00:00:50.840 --> 00:00:56.390
 that if we come, we just have to finish 

00:00:54.530 --> 00:00:59.210
 with the two witches and with both 

00:00:56.390 --> 00:01:00.590
 howlers before climbing up on that 

00:00:59.210 --> 00:01:03.320
 it's not that we climb upstairs we can 

00:01:00.590 --> 00:01:05.810
 shoot there we make no mistake about 

00:01:03.320 --> 00:01:08.030
 agreement after head and everything is 

00:01:05.810 --> 00:01:10.100
 same we come with the sorcerer we jump to the 

00:01:08.030 --> 00:01:13.160
 little stone that we come to the poyete 

00:01:10.100 --> 00:01:15.890
 this suv we would go upwards already towards 

00:01:13.160 --> 00:01:17.510
 right here in this profile and already 

00:01:15.890 --> 00:01:20.240
 around here we would do it the other way around the titan 

00:01:17.510 --> 00:01:23.869
 we would not have that part up here 

00:01:20.240 --> 00:01:26.270
 and from here to the highs of these here 

00:01:23.869 --> 00:01:27.800
 up according what we're going to do 

00:01:26.270 --> 00:01:29.300
 now let's look at it with the case of the 

00:01:27.800 --> 00:01:31.560
 same steps so there is no mess 

00:01:29.300 --> 00:01:36.600
 agreement 

00:01:31.560 --> 00:01:38.400
 hunter the class of the blades 

00:01:36.600 --> 00:01:40.450
 the one that becomes transparent to say it 

00:01:38.400 --> 00:01:43.310
 well go 

00:01:40.450 --> 00:01:45.409
 and we would do the same steps 

00:01:43.310 --> 00:01:48.079
 the dolls always put you for these 

00:01:45.409 --> 00:01:49.880
 things agility to the top so the various 

00:01:48.079 --> 00:01:52.149
 hospitals always tired and give 

00:01:49.880 --> 00:01:52.149
 Actions 

00:01:52.300 --> 00:01:59.390
 and here there are not very solid gentlemen 

00:01:55.650 --> 00:02:03.630
 and very solid and I have not seen it 

00:01:59.390 --> 00:02:06.990
 made and mother of god but good every 

00:02:03.630 --> 00:02:08.160
 we are good at some things and I am 

00:02:06.990 --> 00:02:11.009
 seeing that this is the same with the 

00:02:08.160 --> 00:02:13.980
 hunter absolutely the same we would have 

00:02:11.009 --> 00:02:15.840
 on the same side agreement and with the background 

00:02:13.980 --> 00:02:18.660
 the only thing of the last jump 100 more 

00:02:15.840 --> 00:02:19.920
 difficult and I that with the three jumps 

00:02:18.660 --> 00:02:22.590
 it arrives well but it is difficult to agree 

00:02:19.920 --> 00:02:25.410
 Now what are we going to do? Let's 

00:02:22.590 --> 00:02:27.750
 return to the sorcerer and we would see 

00:02:25.410 --> 00:02:30.240
 for the sorcerer who arrives without rival 

00:02:27.750 --> 00:02:33.360
 problems from up here we would jump 

00:02:30.240 --> 00:02:35.220
 we stop them floating and if we look at the 

00:02:33.360 --> 00:02:37.860
 carpet in front go to see how you 

00:02:35.220 --> 00:02:39.240
 I give who here here just spend it 

00:02:37.860 --> 00:02:42.660
 a little bit important for it to arrive 

00:02:39.240 --> 00:02:44.390
 we're going to get over there in agreement and nothing 

00:02:42.660 --> 00:02:48.709
 signals but that I'm going to show the video 

00:02:44.390 --> 00:02:48.709
 Good wishes and even others
