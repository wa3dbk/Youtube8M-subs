00:01:51.889 --> 00:01:51.899 
score in a multitude of ways that I

00:01:51.899 --> 00:01:54.410 
score in a multitude of ways that I
think<00:01:52.380> what<00:01:52.590> would<00:01:52.770> separate<00:01:53.310> it<00:01:53.460> though<00:01:53.640> no

00:01:54.410 --> 00:01:54.420 
think what would separate it though no

00:01:54.420 --> 00:01:56.660 
think what would separate it though no
he's<00:01:54.659> got<00:01:54.810> the<00:01:54.990> mid-range<00:01:55.380> you<00:01:56.189> know<00:01:56.310> he<00:01:56.490> can

00:01:58.459 --> 00:01:58.469 
finish in traffic he gets to the

00:01:58.469 --> 00:02:00.950 
finish in traffic he gets to the
free-throw<00:01:58.710> line<00:01:59.189> he<00:01:59.549> can<00:01:59.729> take<00:02:00.060> a<00:02:00.090> deep<00:02:00.450> he

shoulder he can do all those things that
you<00:02:04.020> want<00:02:04.200> I<00:02:04.290> think<00:02:04.530> it<00:02:04.649> would<00:02:04.770> actually<00:02:04.799> come

00:02:05.359 --> 00:02:05.369 
you want I think it would actually come

00:02:05.369 --> 00:02:08.570 
you want I think it would actually come
down<00:02:05.630> to<00:02:06.630> defense<00:02:07.110> because<00:02:07.560> he's<00:02:08.340> going<00:02:08.520> to

00:02:08.570 --> 00:02:08.580 
down to defense because he's going to

00:02:08.580 --> 00:02:11.240 
down to defense because he's going to
have<00:02:08.759> some<00:02:09.030> success<00:02:09.270> but<00:02:09.830> LeBron<00:02:10.830> would<00:02:11.039> have

00:02:11.240 --> 00:02:11.250 
have some success but LeBron would have

00:02:11.250 --> 00:02:13.790 
have some success but LeBron would have
an<00:02:11.459> easier<00:02:12.030> time<00:02:12.300> getting<00:02:12.540> stops<00:02:13.319> against

00:02:13.790 --> 00:02:13.800 
an easier time getting stops against

00:02:13.800 --> 00:02:16.040 
an easier time getting stops against
him<00:02:13.980> then<00:02:14.880> he's<00:02:15.210> going<00:02:15.420> to<00:02:15.480> have<00:02:15.660> getting

00:02:16.040 --> 00:02:16.050 
him then he's going to have getting

00:02:16.050 --> 00:02:17.480 
him then he's going to have getting
stops<00:02:16.350> against<00:02:16.680> the<00:02:16.800> Brian<00:02:16.980> and<00:02:17.190> that's<00:02:17.310> why<00:02:17.460> i

00:02:17.480 --> 00:02:17.490 
stops against the Brian and that's why i

00:02:17.490 --> 00:02:19.760 
stops against the Brian and that's why i
would<00:02:18.150> say<00:02:18.360> LeBron's<00:02:18.840> got<00:02:18.960> the<00:02:19.230> night<00:02:19.410> so

00:02:19.760 --> 00:02:19.770 
would say LeBron's got the night so

00:02:19.770 --> 00:02:21.800 
would say LeBron's got the night so
that's<00:02:19.980> what<00:02:20.220> GA<00:02:20.730> and<00:02:20.910> Chris<00:02:21.180> have<00:02:21.510> to<00:02:21.660> say
