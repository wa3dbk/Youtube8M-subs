00:02:34.620 --> 00:02:36.230

the basic up-and-down shifting and

00:02:41.030 --> 00:02:41.040 

00:02:41.040 --> 00:02:44.000 

second<00:02:42.040> to<00:02:42.100> third

00:02:44.000 --> 00:02:44.010 
second to third

00:02:44.010 --> 00:02:48.309 
second to third
third<00:02:44.640> to<00:02:44.849> fifth

00:02:48.309 --> 00:02:48.319 

00:02:48.319 --> 00:02:55.089 

fifth<00:02:49.010> to<00:02:49.280> seventh<00:02:49.670> at<00:02:49.849> 1500

00:02:55.089 --> 00:02:55.099 

00:02:55.099 --> 00:02:58.350 

and<00:02:55.280> seven<00:02:55.849> to<00:02:56.060> eight<00:02:56.209> to<00:02:56.480> fourteen<00:02:56.870> fifteen

00:02:58.350 --> 00:02:58.360 
and seven to eight to fourteen fifteen

00:02:58.360 --> 00:03:00.510 
and seven to eight to fourteen fifteen
so<00:02:58.420> she's<00:02:58.600> really<00:02:58.870> a<00:02:58.900> low<00:02:59.110> rpm<00:02:59.320> shift<00:03:00.070> program

00:03:00.510 --> 00:03:00.520 
so she's really a low rpm shift program

00:03:00.520 --> 00:03:02.640 
so she's really a low rpm shift program
there<00:03:00.730> that's<00:03:01.600> the<00:03:01.750> idea<00:03:02.020> to<00:03:02.080> keep<00:03:02.290> the<00:03:02.470> revs

00:03:02.640 --> 00:03:02.650 
there that's the idea to keep the revs

00:03:02.650 --> 00:03:05.190 
there that's the idea to keep the revs
between<00:03:03.070> 1100<00:03:03.820> and<00:03:03.910> 1500<00:03:04.570> or<00:03:04.690> so<00:03:04.840> that's<00:03:05.050> your

00:03:05.190 --> 00:03:05.200 
between 1100 and 1500 or so that's your

00:03:05.200 --> 00:03:06.949 
between 1100 and 1500 or so that's your
prime<00:03:05.500> fuel<00:03:05.830> economy

00:03:06.949 --> 00:03:06.959 
prime fuel economy

00:03:06.959 --> 00:03:10.910 
prime fuel economy
now<00:03:07.469> we're<00:03:07.620> at<00:03:07.709> the<00:03:07.739> ninth<00:03:08.040> gear<00:03:09.230> 1300<00:03:10.230> rpm<00:03:10.590> at

00:03:10.910 --> 00:03:10.920 
now we're at the ninth gear 1300 rpm at

00:03:10.920 --> 00:03:14.270 
now we're at the ninth gear 1300 rpm at
30<00:03:11.280> miles<00:03:11.519> an<00:03:11.700> hour<00:03:11.840> and<00:03:12.840> now<00:03:13.709> let's<00:03:14.040> have<00:03:14.189> a

00:03:14.270 --> 00:03:14.280 
30 miles an hour and now let's have a

00:03:14.280 --> 00:03:17.479 
30 miles an hour and now let's have a
look<00:03:14.489> at<00:03:14.640> how<00:03:14.730> creep<00:03:15.060> mode<00:03:15.269> works<00:03:16.370> when<00:03:17.370> you're

00:03:17.479 --> 00:03:17.489 
look at how creep mode works when you're

00:03:17.489 --> 00:03:19.190 
look at how creep mode works when you're
at<00:03:17.579> a<00:03:17.609> light<00:03:17.849> like<00:03:18.030> this<00:03:18.239> if<00:03:18.689> you<00:03:18.840> take<00:03:19.019> your

00:03:19.190 --> 00:03:19.200 
at a light like this if you take your

00:03:21.390 --> 00:03:23.869 
foot off the brake the creep mode

00:03:39.000 --> 00:03:40.849 
other inputs it will engage the clutch
gently<00:03:39.540> barely<00:03:40.169> even<00:03:40.260> feel<00:03:40.560> the<00:03:40.709> engagement

gently barely even feel the engagement

00:03:40.859 --> 00:03:43.309 
gently barely even feel the engagement
and<00:03:41.730> will<00:03:41.939> start<00:03:42.209> slowly<00:03:42.480> creeping<00:03:43.049> forward

00:03:43.309 --> 00:03:43.319

in<00:03:44.189> creep<00:03:44.549> mode<00:03:44.760> you<00:03:44.909> can<00:03:45.060> also<00:03:45.120> up<00:03:45.569> shift<00:03:45.840> as

00:03:46.009 --> 00:03:46.019 
in creep mode you can also up shift as

00:03:46.019 --> 00:03:50.330 
in creep mode you can also up shift as
well<00:03:46.669> so<00:03:47.669> now<00:03:47.849> we're<00:03:48.030> in<00:03:48.120> Creek<00:03:48.450> second<00:03:49.340> up

00:03:50.330 --> 00:03:50.340 
well so now we're in Creek second up

00:03:50.340 --> 00:03:52.220 
well so now we're in Creek second up
shift<00:03:50.609> to<00:03:50.790> creep<00:03:51.030> now<00:03:51.209> I'm<00:03:51.389> in<00:03:51.510> complete<00:03:51.750> third

right back where I wanted to go some

00:04:49.889 --> 00:04:52.219 
right back where I wanted to go some
people<00:04:50.189> wonder<00:04:50.520> how<00:04:50.550> effective<00:04:51.240> a<00:04:51.419> coast<00:04:51.689> is<00:04:52.050> I

00:04:52.219 --> 00:04:52.229 
people wonder how effective a coast is I

00:04:52.229 --> 00:04:54.529 
people wonder how effective a coast is I
mean<00:04:52.649> the<00:04:52.979> engine<00:04:53.129> actually<00:04:53.459> decouples<00:04:54.389> from

00:04:54.529 --> 00:04:54.539 
mean the engine actually decouples from

00:04:54.539 --> 00:04:56.149 
mean the engine actually decouples from
the<00:04:54.659> transmission<00:04:55.169> while<00:04:55.439> rolling<00:04:55.919> downhill

00:04:56.149 --> 00:04:56.159 
the transmission while rolling downhill

00:04:56.159 --> 00:04:58.459 
the transmission while rolling downhill
the<00:04:57.059> thinking<00:04:57.389> behind<00:04:57.509> the<00:04:57.809> idea<00:04:58.110> is<00:04:58.289> to

00:04:58.459 --> 00:04:58.469 
the thinking behind the idea is to

00:04:58.469 --> 00:05:00.499 
the thinking behind the idea is to
conserve<00:04:58.800> momentum<00:04:59.069> so<00:04:59.699> the<00:04:59.849> truck<00:05:00.089> can<00:05:00.300> run

00:05:00.499 --> 00:05:00.509 
conserve momentum so the truck can run

00:05:00.509 --> 00:05:02.779 
conserve momentum so the truck can run
out<00:05:00.659> longer<00:05:01.050> yeah<00:05:01.649> I<00:05:01.679> was<00:05:02.039> skeptical<00:05:02.580> too

00:05:02.779 --> 00:05:02.789 
out longer yeah I was skeptical too

00:05:02.789 --> 00:05:04.639 
out longer yeah I was skeptical too
