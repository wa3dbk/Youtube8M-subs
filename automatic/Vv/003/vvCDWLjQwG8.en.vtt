00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.529

00:00:02.520 --> 00:00:06.509
 hair is more than a year since 

00:00:04.529 --> 00:00:08.730
 that I launched the invitation recommending five 

00:00:06.509 --> 00:00:10.830
 king books which was one of the videos 

00:00:08.730 --> 00:00:12.929
 most viewed here from the channel and is the video 

00:00:10.830 --> 00:00:15.089
 that I consider the first game is not 

00:00:12.929 --> 00:00:17.640
 Of course, a writer as great as 

00:00:15.089 --> 00:00:19.770
 this end and would not have only five books 

00:00:17.640 --> 00:00:21.869
 What you need to light up and enjoy 

00:00:19.770 --> 00:00:23.189
 this partnership that the disconnected channel has 

00:00:21.869 --> 00:00:25.439
 with the publisher about books that the publisher 

00:00:23.189 --> 00:00:29.070
 who publishes in Beijing she did not come 

00:00:25.439 --> 00:00:30.750
 bring more order books edition 

00:00:29.070 --> 00:00:34.590
 You only have to read that this time with 

00:00:30.750 --> 00:00:37.260

00:00:34.590 --> 00:00:40.530

 I selected here are 30 in the short 

00:00:40.530 --> 00:00:45.510
 small and has extremely 

00:00:43.350 --> 00:00:47.640
 great choice from the list the book that 

00:00:45.510 --> 00:00:49.050
 has just been released by the publisher 

00:00:47.640 --> 00:00:53.520
 a book that was released in the 

00:00:49.050 --> 00:00:55.199
 united states in 2013 that is of orlândia 

00:00:53.520 --> 00:00:56.460
 album does not have any of the 

00:00:55.199 --> 00:01:00.510
 50 year old pages 

00:00:56.460 --> 00:01:02.250
 but it's that thing that rescues the chic 

00:01:00.510 --> 00:01:04.650
 classic and tells the story of Dave 

00:01:02.250 --> 00:01:06.150

00:01:04.650 --> 00:01:08.549

 of the ghost train girl was murdered 

00:01:12.659 --> 00:01:17.670
 This is proof of this. 28 

00:01:15.240 --> 00:01:20.549
 little more about this murder ends 

00:01:17.670 --> 00:01:22.470
 discovering that it was not just this 

00:01:20.549 --> 00:01:24.869
 murder that maybe in a serial 

00:01:22.470 --> 00:01:27.240
 killer is a short book is a book that 

00:01:24.869 --> 00:01:29.159
 take you make up the end and you 

00:01:27.240 --> 00:01:31.470
 prefer law because it really is too much 

00:01:29.159 --> 00:01:33.600
 very good fun interspersing a 

00:01:31.470 --> 00:01:36.240
 small book the second book of the 

00:01:33.600 --> 00:01:39.110
 list is part of a big book that is the 

00:01:36.240 --> 00:01:42.960
 best of all you've called and the king 

00:01:39.110 --> 00:01:45.030
 November 63 8 63 tells the story of 

00:01:42.960 --> 00:01:46.590
 a r english teacher mayday 

00:01:45.030 --> 00:01:49.049
 just met the law with fame 

00:01:46.590 --> 00:01:51.360
 that lead directly to the 

00:01:49.049 --> 00:01:53.759
 the 50s he is within the mission of 

00:01:51.360 --> 00:01:56.340
 turn back time and prevent the murder 

00:01:53.759 --> 00:01:59.280
 president kennedy that happens in the 

00:01:56.340 --> 00:02:01.920
 November 22 , 1963 

00:01:59.280 --> 00:02:04.010
 the mall that has an ability to 

00:02:01.920 --> 00:02:06.500
 discretion that you 

00:02:04.010 --> 00:02:08.510
 he really believes that they travel in 

00:02:06.500 --> 00:02:10.520
 possible time and the most interesting 

00:02:08.510 --> 00:02:12.680
 it is green from the time he now wants 

00:02:10.520 --> 00:02:16.430
 time has several types of approach and 

00:02:12.680 --> 00:02:19.580
 in this case it addresses the aspect that the 

00:02:16.430 --> 00:02:22.340
 past protects us from being altered 

00:02:19.580 --> 00:02:23.720
 so you go back in time and try to change 

00:02:22.340 --> 00:02:25.760
 something happened 

00:02:23.720 --> 00:02:27.980
 the past will protect itself from all 

00:02:25.760 --> 00:02:29.660
 ways for you to talk about the past 

00:02:27.980 --> 00:02:33.170
 continue the way you've always been saying 

00:02:29.660 --> 00:02:35.030
 this list is a missile written after the 

00:02:33.170 --> 00:02:38.090
 of the mall that has been invaded 

00:02:35.030 --> 00:02:41.000
 by a fan and he started half 

00:02:38.090 --> 00:02:43.010
 fantasize like you would be a fan really 

00:02:41.000 --> 00:02:45.500
 crazy does not have this writer who 

00:02:43.010 --> 00:02:47.270
 mattress that a joke with cid stir 

00:02:45.500 --> 00:02:49.340
 who writes a novel in the media 

00:02:47.270 --> 00:02:51.200
 bank tell during a trip is over 

00:02:49.340 --> 00:02:53.990
 suffering a car accident and I am 

00:02:51.200 --> 00:02:55.910
 Fan number 1 ends up rescuing him can only 

00:02:53.990 --> 00:02:57.590
 being also heard that he begins to care 

00:02:55.910 --> 00:02:59.870
 when he realizes he is a 

00:02:57.590 --> 00:03:02.150
 prisoner who has nothing of 

00:02:59.870 --> 00:03:05.090
 supernatural this story is only one 

00:03:02.150 --> 00:03:07.130
 extremely psychological terror and also 

00:03:05.090 --> 00:03:09.620
 has a movie called Crazy Obsession that 

00:03:07.130 --> 00:03:11.360
 was the only film fink have off was 

00:03:09.620 --> 00:03:13.520
 the Oscar of Best Actress for Kate Bates 

00:03:11.360 --> 00:03:16.190
 who played in a quarter of this list 

00:03:13.520 --> 00:03:19.400
 is simply the greatest book ever written 

00:03:16.190 --> 00:03:22.640
 by stephen king that is the dance of death 

00:03:19.400 --> 00:03:25.459
 this maximum face of 1,250 pages 

00:03:22.640 --> 00:03:27.050
 portrays an apocalypse that the flu 

00:03:25.459 --> 00:03:29.840
 originated from a virus that 

00:03:27.050 --> 00:03:32.630
 no crisis difficult to explain what 

00:03:29.840 --> 00:03:35.090
 it is about his death as well as a 

00:03:32.630 --> 00:03:37.340
 apocalypse why talk to him for being 

00:03:35.090 --> 00:03:40.160
 something superfluous to write a 

00:03:37.340 --> 00:03:42.470
 The book of this size is 

00:03:40.160 --> 00:03:46.610
 character very hypothesis and neither 

00:03:42.470 --> 00:03:48.680
 so had the flu that wiped out 99% of 

00:03:46.610 --> 00:03:49.640
 population of the society is divided into two 

00:03:48.680 --> 00:03:51.670
 groups 

00:03:49.640 --> 00:03:54.950
 the group that is the group of the good that is 

00:03:51.670 --> 00:03:57.260
 led by the morning fell and the group of evil 

00:03:54.950 --> 00:03:59.480
 which is led by the dark man who 

00:03:57.260 --> 00:04:01.459
 also called the king of flec 

00:03:59.480 --> 00:04:03.920
 character that appears in the eyes book 

00:04:01.459 --> 00:04:05.300
 dragon and also in the black tower series the 

00:04:03.920 --> 00:04:06.890
 fifth book of this list as well as the 

00:04:05.300 --> 00:04:11.510
 dance of death and the next I go 

00:04:06.890 --> 00:04:13.280
 talk is considered the masterpiece of the type 

00:04:11.510 --> 00:04:15.350
 king what's on 

00:04:13.280 --> 00:04:18.980
 about writing is not a book of fiction 

00:04:15.350 --> 00:04:23.690
 is practically an auto biography of 

00:04:18.980 --> 00:04:26.300
 steve king along with a writing class 

00:04:23.690 --> 00:04:27.830
 free her from the front king braskem 

00:04:26.300 --> 00:04:29.990
 I just like a book more 

00:04:27.830 --> 00:04:32.210
 especially for those who like 

00:04:29.990 --> 00:04:34.490
 write and with whom it best meets 

00:04:32.210 --> 00:04:36.320
 because with messi about that wrote 

00:04:34.490 --> 00:04:37.820
 also spoke by appealing to the publisher 

00:04:36.320 --> 00:04:39.710
 assume this is a book you do not need 

00:04:37.820 --> 00:04:41.810
 Being a fan of this link is simply a 

00:04:39.710 --> 00:04:42.889
 book you should read your last 

00:04:41.810 --> 00:04:45.260
 list book 

00:04:42.889 --> 00:04:47.720
 Did you see the fake graveyard video to my 

00:04:45.260 --> 00:04:49.970
 future of chem but after he is 

00:04:47.720 --> 00:04:53.480
 I was really in my life because it's a 

00:04:49.970 --> 00:04:57.020
 work of art a work states that it is the 

00:04:53.480 --> 00:05:00.590
 thing known as that book of a thousand and 

00:04:57.020 --> 00:05:02.690
 hundred pages portrays many things 

00:05:00.590 --> 00:05:05.990
 he portrays friendship he is of love to 

00:05:02.690 --> 00:05:08.540
 confidence and above all with fear as 

00:05:05.990 --> 00:05:10.970
 I explained nothing, just round you, it's just a 

00:05:08.540 --> 00:05:13.070
 thing is always much deeper is that 

00:05:10.970 --> 00:05:16.790
 the story of six friends during the 

00:05:13.070 --> 00:05:20.150
 children in 1958 they will face a 

00:05:16.790 --> 00:05:22.130
 thing that is an evil creature that does not 

00:05:20.150 --> 00:05:25.850
 has definition and why the same name 

00:05:22.130 --> 00:05:28.130
 eth is that it does not have a definition 

00:05:25.850 --> 00:05:30.169
 as they go back to the quiet thing their 

00:05:28.130 --> 00:05:32.900
 school they meet again almost 

00:05:30.169 --> 00:05:35.150
 30 years later because the thing can have 

00:05:32.900 --> 00:05:38.360
 facing this is a book that portrays 

00:05:35.150 --> 00:05:39.320
 perfectly what is childhood what it is 

00:05:38.360 --> 00:05:42.740
 friendship 

00:05:39.320 --> 00:05:44.360
 If you are a reader you need to read 

00:05:42.740 --> 00:05:46.310
 This is the book that you 

00:05:44.360 --> 00:05:48.410
