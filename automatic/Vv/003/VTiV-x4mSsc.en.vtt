00:00:03.500 --> 00:00:03.510 
hey James here we'll just kick off from

00:00:03.510 --> 00:00:06.019 
hey James here we'll just kick off from
where<00:00:03.720> we<00:00:03.840> were<00:00:03.870> leaving<00:00:04.170> and<00:00:04.470> we<00:00:04.589> were<00:00:04.740> up<00:00:05.700> to

00:00:06.019 --> 00:00:06.029 
where we were leaving and we were up to

00:00:06.029 --> 00:00:09.560 
where we were leaving and we were up to
a<00:00:06.120> c-shape<00:00:06.839> our<00:00:07.379> C<00:00:07.710> shape<00:00:08.010> is<00:00:08.220> essentially<00:00:08.910> an

00:00:09.560 --> 00:00:09.570 
a c-shape our C shape is essentially an

00:00:09.570 --> 00:00:14.959 
a c-shape our C shape is essentially an
open<00:00:09.900> mouth<00:00:10.139> with<00:00:11.420> sort<00:00:12.420> of<00:00:12.480> the<00:00:12.690> top<00:00:13.790> part<00:00:14.790> of

00:00:14.959 --> 00:00:14.969 
open mouth with sort of the top part of

00:00:14.969 --> 00:00:19.220 
open mouth with sort of the top part of
it<00:00:15.089> showing<00:00:15.420> so<00:00:16.350> I<00:00:16.379> think<00:00:16.500> I<00:00:16.830> might<00:00:17.990> steal<00:00:18.990> my

00:00:19.220 --> 00:00:19.230 
it showing so I think I might steal my

00:00:19.230 --> 00:00:26.080 
it showing so I think I might steal my
previous<00:00:19.710> mouth<00:00:19.980> shape<00:00:20.279> to<00:00:20.460> do<00:00:20.670> this<00:00:23.000> just

00:00:26.080 --> 00:00:26.090 

00:00:26.090 --> 00:00:31.880 

copy<00:00:27.090> it<00:00:27.330> paste<00:00:28.970> it<00:00:30.080> you<00:00:31.080> don't<00:00:31.320> want<00:00:31.650> the

00:00:31.880 --> 00:00:31.890 
copy it paste it you don't want the

00:00:31.890 --> 00:00:33.799 
copy it paste it you don't want the
white<00:00:32.130> you<00:00:32.700> don't<00:00:32.880> need<00:00:33.030> these<00:00:33.239> little<00:00:33.420> back

00:00:33.799 --> 00:00:33.809 
white you don't need these little back

00:00:33.809 --> 00:00:36.770 
white you don't need these little back
parts<00:00:34.579> I'm<00:00:35.579> going<00:00:35.760> to<00:00:35.820> change<00:00:36.120> the<00:00:36.300> shape<00:00:36.540> of

00:00:36.770 --> 00:00:36.780 
parts I'm going to change the shape of

00:00:36.780 --> 00:00:41.049 
parts I'm going to change the shape of
this<00:00:36.899> mouth<00:00:37.200> of<00:00:37.440> it<00:00:37.620> it's<00:00:38.250> more<00:00:38.700> of<00:00:38.850> a<00:00:39.000> round<00:00:39.360> ii

00:00:41.049 --> 00:00:41.059 
this mouth of it it's more of a round ii

00:00:41.059 --> 00:00:44.360 
this mouth of it it's more of a round ii
the<00:00:42.059> shapes<00:00:42.420> let's<00:00:42.870> just<00:00:43.010> don't<00:00:44.010> need<00:00:44.190> these

00:00:44.360 --> 00:00:44.370 
the shapes let's just don't need these

00:00:44.370 --> 00:00:53.340 
the shapes let's just don't need these
points

00:00:53.340 --> 00:00:53.350 

00:00:53.350 --> 00:00:56.189 

so<00:00:54.340> we're<00:00:54.489> trying<00:00:54.609> to<00:00:54.820> cram<00:00:55.390> to<00:00:55.629> shape<00:00:55.870> for<00:00:56.170> a

00:00:56.189 --> 00:00:56.199 
so we're trying to cram to shape for a

00:00:56.199 --> 00:01:12.790 
so we're trying to cram to shape for a
mouth

00:01:12.790 --> 00:01:12.800 

00:01:12.800 --> 00:01:18.310 

a<00:01:13.060> little<00:01:14.060> bit<00:01:14.210> will<00:01:14.330> end<00:01:14.600> up<00:01:14.810> here<00:01:17.260> now<00:01:18.260> we

00:01:18.310 --> 00:01:18.320 
a little bit will end up here now we

00:01:18.320 --> 00:01:31.030 
a little bit will end up here now we
just<00:01:18.410> need<00:01:18.650> a<00:01:18.860> line<00:01:22.120> black<00:01:23.120> line<00:01:29.890> let's<00:01:30.890> say

00:01:31.030 --> 00:01:31.040 
just need a line black line let's say

00:01:31.040 --> 00:01:34.780 
just need a line black line let's say
that<00:01:31.190> okay<00:01:32.410> again<00:01:33.410> it<00:01:33.590> is<00:01:33.620> just<00:01:33.950> way<00:01:34.220> too<00:01:34.280> thick

00:01:34.780 --> 00:01:34.790 
that okay again it is just way too thick

00:01:34.790 --> 00:01:36.730 
that okay again it is just way too thick
so<00:01:35.150> you<00:01:35.810> can<00:01:35.960> just<00:01:35.990> go<00:01:36.260> into<00:01:36.410> your<00:01:36.500> tool

00:01:36.730 --> 00:01:36.740 
so you can just go into your tool

00:01:36.740 --> 00:01:41.380 
so you can just go into your tool
properties<00:01:37.450> and<00:01:38.450> drop<00:01:38.780> the<00:01:38.990> size<00:01:39.260> down<00:01:40.390> if

00:01:41.380 --> 00:01:41.390 
properties and drop the size down if

00:01:41.390 --> 00:01:43.210 
properties and drop the size down if
that<00:01:41.660> is<00:01:41.840> selected<00:01:42.380> when<00:01:42.500> you<00:01:42.650> drop<00:01:42.800> the<00:01:42.980> size

00:01:43.210 --> 00:01:43.220 
that is selected when you drop the size

00:01:43.220 --> 00:01:49.180 
that is selected when you drop the size
so<00:01:44.000> bear<00:01:44.240> that<00:01:44.270> in<00:01:44.510> mind<00:01:45.640> and<00:01:46.640> now<00:01:47.860> just<00:01:48.860> bend

00:01:49.180 --> 00:01:49.190 
so bear that in mind and now just bend

00:01:49.190 --> 00:01:57.630 
so bear that in mind and now just bend
it<00:01:49.370> down<00:01:54.430> let<00:01:55.430> me<00:01:55.550> have<00:01:55.670> our<00:01:55.820> white<00:01:56.090> we<00:01:56.960> need<00:01:57.200> to

00:01:57.630 --> 00:01:57.640 
it down let me have our white we need to

00:01:57.640 --> 00:02:02.110 
it down let me have our white we need to
fill<00:01:58.640> in<00:01:58.820> some<00:01:59.030> medium<00:01:59.870> gaps<00:02:00.140> there<00:02:01.120> that's

00:02:02.110 --> 00:02:02.120 
fill in some medium gaps there that's

00:02:02.120 --> 00:02:04.000 
fill in some medium gaps there that's
going<00:02:02.330> to<00:02:02.420> be<00:02:02.510> our<00:02:02.540> teeth<00:02:02.810> on<00:02:03.020> the<00:02:03.110> top<00:02:03.200> and

00:02:04.000 --> 00:02:04.010 
going to be our teeth on the top and

00:02:04.010 --> 00:02:05.440 
going to be our teeth on the top and
this<00:02:04.160> bottom<00:02:04.520> part<00:02:04.700> we<00:02:04.850> can't<00:02:05.060> just<00:02:05.270> make

00:02:05.440 --> 00:02:05.450 
this bottom part we can't just make

00:02:05.450 --> 00:02:07.090 
this bottom part we can't just make
black<00:02:05.810> because<00:02:06.200> it<00:02:06.320> will<00:02:06.410> look<00:02:06.590> really<00:02:06.620> bad

00:02:07.090 --> 00:02:07.100 
black because it will look really bad

00:02:07.100 --> 00:02:11.710 
black because it will look really bad
like<00:02:09.010> you<00:02:10.010> can<00:02:10.190> see<00:02:10.399> that<00:02:10.429> just<00:02:11.000> doesn't<00:02:11.300> work

00:02:11.710 --> 00:02:11.720 
like you can see that just doesn't work

00:02:11.720 --> 00:02:16.390 
like you can see that just doesn't work
so<00:02:12.680> what<00:02:13.220> we<00:02:13.400> to<00:02:13.610> do<00:02:13.820> here<00:02:14.920> let<00:02:15.920> go<00:02:16.130> and<00:02:16.250> create

00:02:16.390 --> 00:02:16.400 
so what we to do here let go and create

00:02:16.400 --> 00:02:26.350 
so what we to do here let go and create
a<00:02:16.520> rep<00:02:16.760> we<00:02:17.030> want<00:02:17.209> to<00:02:17.270> really<00:02:17.600> dark<00:02:18.560> room<00:02:25.360> you

00:02:26.350 --> 00:02:26.360 
a rep we want to really dark room you

00:02:26.360 --> 00:02:28.000 
a rep we want to really dark room you
can<00:02:26.540> see<00:02:26.630> I<00:02:26.660> just<00:02:26.750> dropped<00:02:27.290> the<00:02:27.440> red<00:02:27.620> in<00:02:27.800> so

00:02:28.000 --> 00:02:28.010 
can see I just dropped the red in so

00:02:28.010 --> 00:02:29.410 
can see I just dropped the red in so
that<00:02:28.040> I<00:02:28.280> can<00:02:28.400> actually<00:02:28.670> see<00:02:29.060> it<00:02:29.180> in<00:02:29.300> the

00:02:29.410 --> 00:02:29.420 
that I can actually see it in the

00:02:29.420 --> 00:02:32.890 
that I can actually see it in the
character<00:02:30.020> while<00:02:30.890> I'm<00:02:31.420> playing<00:02:32.420> with<00:02:32.720> the

00:02:32.890 --> 00:02:32.900 
character while I'm playing with the

00:02:32.900 --> 00:02:39.580 
character while I'm playing with the
values<00:02:33.320> for<00:02:33.560> us<00:02:33.739> I<00:02:34.600> think<00:02:35.600> that's<00:02:35.840> nice<00:02:36.560> red<00:02:38.590> so

00:02:39.580 --> 00:02:39.590 
values for us I think that's nice red so

00:02:39.590 --> 00:02:42.640 
values for us I think that's nice red so
that's<00:02:39.800> going<00:02:40.070> to<00:02:40.190> be<00:02:40.280> the<00:02:40.760> inside<00:02:41.360> of<00:02:41.750> our

00:02:42.640 --> 00:02:42.650 
that's going to be the inside of our

00:02:42.650 --> 00:02:44.340 
that's going to be the inside of our
mouth<00:02:42.890> color<00:02:43.280> and<00:02:43.580> we'll<00:02:43.880> use<00:02:44.150> that

00:02:44.340 --> 00:02:44.350 
mouth color and we'll use that

00:02:44.350 --> 00:02:50.190 
mouth color and we'll use that
throughout<00:02:45.970> and<00:02:47.560> this<00:02:48.560> is<00:02:48.739> going<00:02:48.950> to<00:02:49.250> be<00:02:49.489> a

00:02:50.190 --> 00:02:50.200 
throughout and this is going to be a

00:02:50.200 --> 00:02:56.380 
throughout and this is going to be a
c-shape

00:02:56.380 --> 00:02:56.390 

00:02:56.390 --> 00:02:59.240 

your<00:02:57.390> node<00:02:57.629> if<00:02:57.930> you<00:02:58.140> use<00:02:58.319> symbols<00:02:58.769> you<00:02:58.980> can't

00:02:59.240 --> 00:02:59.250 
your node if you use symbols you can't

00:02:59.250 --> 00:03:02.030 
your node if you use symbols you can't
rename<00:02:59.700> like<00:03:00.000> this<00:03:00.300> so<00:03:01.080> don't<00:03:01.349> if<00:03:01.860> you've

00:03:02.030 --> 00:03:02.040 
rename like this so don't if you've

00:03:02.040 --> 00:03:03.920 
rename like this so don't if you've
created<00:03:02.280> symbols<00:03:02.910> just<00:03:03.269> don't<00:03:03.540> even<00:03:03.660> think

00:03:03.920 --> 00:03:03.930 
created symbols just don't even think

00:03:03.930 --> 00:03:05.690 
created symbols just don't even think
about<00:03:04.080> trying<00:03:04.260> to<00:03:04.560> rename<00:03:05.010> them<00:03:05.250> because<00:03:05.550> you

00:03:05.690 --> 00:03:05.700 
about trying to rename them because you

00:03:05.700 --> 00:03:11.000 
about trying to rename them because you
can<00:03:08.360> so<00:03:09.360> now<00:03:09.629> we<00:03:09.690> go<00:03:10.050> back<00:03:10.080> to<00:03:10.230> a<00:03:10.440> library<00:03:10.890> we

00:03:11.000 --> 00:03:11.010 
can so now we go back to a library we

00:03:11.010 --> 00:03:16.820 
can so now we go back to a library we
now<00:03:11.190> have<00:03:11.519> an<00:03:12.500> ABC<00:03:13.500> on<00:03:13.680> X<00:03:15.140> so<00:03:16.140> we<00:03:16.349> all<00:03:16.440> look<00:03:16.739> at

00:03:16.820 --> 00:03:16.830 
now have an ABC on X so we all look at

00:03:16.830 --> 00:03:18.199 
now have an ABC on X so we all look at
that<00:03:16.980> test<00:03:17.250> their<00:03:17.459> next<00:03:17.700> one<00:03:17.849> we<00:03:17.970> want<00:03:18.120> to

00:03:18.199 --> 00:03:18.209 
that test their next one we want to

00:03:18.209 --> 00:03:22.009 
that test their next one we want to
create<00:03:18.360> is<00:03:19.170> it<00:03:19.560> D<00:03:19.830> so<00:03:20.670> this<00:03:20.700> is<00:03:21.060> although<00:03:21.870> you

00:03:22.009 --> 00:03:22.019 
create is it D so this is although you

00:03:22.019 --> 00:03:23.270 
create is it D so this is although you
can't<00:03:22.200> really<00:03:22.290> see<00:03:22.440> for<00:03:22.739> in<00:03:22.830> that<00:03:22.950> direction

00:03:23.270 --> 00:03:23.280 
can't really see for in that direction

00:03:23.280 --> 00:03:26.570 
can't really see for in that direction
it's<00:03:23.670> what<00:03:24.360> i'm<00:03:24.450> going<00:03:24.690> to<00:03:24.780> do<00:03:25.049> is<00:03:25.580> essentially

00:03:26.570 --> 00:03:26.580 
it's what i'm going to do is essentially

00:03:26.580 --> 00:03:29.569 
it's what i'm going to do is essentially
a<00:03:27.030> more<00:03:28.019> open<00:03:28.410> mouth<00:03:28.680> with<00:03:29.160> a<00:03:29.190> little<00:03:29.459> bit<00:03:29.549> of

00:03:29.569 --> 00:03:29.579 
a more open mouth with a little bit of

00:03:29.579 --> 00:03:33.770 
a more open mouth with a little bit of
the<00:03:29.790> bottom<00:03:30.090> teeth<00:03:30.329> showing<00:03:32.120> so<00:03:33.120> to<00:03:33.569> do<00:03:33.750> that

00:03:33.770 --> 00:03:33.780 
the bottom teeth showing so to do that

00:03:33.780 --> 00:03:40.550 
the bottom teeth showing so to do that
I'm<00:03:34.170> going<00:03:34.410> to<00:03:34.560> copy<00:03:35.400> the<00:03:35.670> shape<00:03:35.940> I<00:03:39.049> mean<00:03:40.049> if<00:03:40.410> I

00:03:40.550 --> 00:03:40.560 
I'm going to copy the shape I mean if I

00:03:40.560 --> 00:03:43.880 
I'm going to copy the shape I mean if I
was<00:03:40.769> doing<00:03:40.950> is<00:03:41.220> my<00:03:41.810> friend<00:03:42.810> on<00:03:42.959> tutorial<00:03:43.680> sort

00:03:43.880 --> 00:03:43.890 
was doing is my friend on tutorial sort

00:03:43.890 --> 00:03:47.240 
was doing is my friend on tutorial sort
of<00:03:43.980> then<00:03:44.190> I'll<00:03:44.670> probably<00:03:45.030> spend<00:03:46.220> you<00:03:47.220> know

00:03:47.240 --> 00:03:47.250 
of then I'll probably spend you know

00:03:47.250 --> 00:03:49.729 
of then I'll probably spend you know
significantly<00:03:48.209> longer<00:03:48.540> on<00:03:49.170> each<00:03:49.470> of<00:03:49.650> these

00:03:49.729 --> 00:03:49.739 
significantly longer on each of these

00:03:49.739 --> 00:03:53.390 
significantly longer on each of these
mouth<00:03:50.010> shapes<00:03:50.340> that<00:03:50.459> I<00:03:50.610> spending<00:03:51.090> now<00:03:52.400> but

mouth shapes that I spending now but
these<00:03:53.760> mouth<00:03:54.060> shapes<00:03:54.390> will<00:03:54.569> be<00:03:54.660> perfectly

00:03:55.130 --> 00:03:55.140 
these mouth shapes will be perfectly

00:03:55.140 --> 00:03:57.680 
these mouth shapes will be perfectly
adequate<00:03:55.739> and<00:03:55.920> you<00:03:56.099> can<00:03:56.310> tweak<00:03:56.610> them<00:03:56.940> to<00:03:57.569> your

00:03:57.680 --> 00:03:57.690

going to lower the mouth of it you only

00:04:10.079 --> 00:04:16.330 
going to lower the mouth of it you only
want<00:04:10.200> a<00:04:10.290> little<00:04:10.590> bit<00:04:10.859> of<00:04:10.950> teeth<00:04:11.280> showing<00:04:11.639> I

a consistency of thickness of lines and

00:04:54.150 --> 00:04:57.170 
a consistency of thickness of lines and

00:04:57.170 --> 00:04:57.180 
only go away from that consistency when

00:04:57.180 --> 00:04:59.810 
only go away from that consistency when
you<00:04:57.300> have<00:04:57.419> a<00:04:57.450> reason<00:04:57.750> to<00:04:58.169> and<00:04:58.440> here<00:04:59.430> I<00:04:59.460> clearly

00:05:02.180 --> 00:05:02.190 
have a reason to because as larger lies

00:05:02.190 --> 00:05:05.600 
have a reason to because as larger lies
just<00:05:02.460> we're<00:05:02.669> going<00:05:03.000> to<00:05:03.120> work

00:06:26.830 --> 00:06:26.840 
the e F and the G I'm going to start off

00:06:26.840 --> 00:06:33.930 
the e F and the G I'm going to start off
by<00:06:27.740> doing<00:06:27.800> the<00:06:28.219> a

00:06:33.930 --> 00:06:33.940

and I'm just going to use an eclipse
we're<00:06:38.200> going<00:06:38.290> to<00:06:38.470> change<00:06:38.890> try<00:06:39.220> to<00:06:39.280> fall<00:06:43.410> as

00:06:44.400 --> 00:06:44.410 
we're going to change try to fall as

we're going to change try to fall as
about<00:06:44.800> this<00:06:45.640> this<00:06:46.030> is<00:06:46.180> a<00:06:46.240> sort<00:06:46.450> of<00:06:46.510> a<00:06:46.630> larger

00:06:47.220 --> 00:06:47.230 
about this this is a sort of a larger

00:06:47.230 --> 00:06:51.750 
about this this is a sort of a larger
shape<00:06:48.660> it's<00:06:49.660> all<00:06:49.780> it<00:06:49.930> going<00:06:50.110> to<00:06:50.200> be<00:06:50.490> to<00:06:51.490> get<00:06:51.610> in

00:06:51.750 --> 00:06:51.760 
shape it's all it going to be to get in

00:06:51.760 --> 00:06:55.140 
shape it's all it going to be to get in
the<00:06:51.880> middle<00:06:53.580> and<00:06:54.580> it's<00:06:54.730> going<00:06:54.850> to<00:06:54.940> be<00:06:55.060> about

00:06:55.140 --> 00:06:55.150 
the middle and it's going to be about

00:06:55.150 --> 00:07:00.990 
the middle and it's going to be about
the<00:06:55.480> width<00:06:55.690> direction<00:06:55.840> now<00:06:59.580> draw<00:07:00.580> a<00:07:00.610> line

00:07:00.990 --> 00:07:01.000 
the width direction now draw a line

00:07:01.000 --> 00:07:07.710 
the width direction now draw a line
across<00:07:01.510> here<00:07:06.090> need<00:07:07.090> to<00:07:07.120> change<00:07:07.450> the<00:07:07.600> width

00:07:07.710 --> 00:07:07.720 
across here need to change the width

00:07:07.720 --> 00:07:21.070 
across here need to change the width
airline

00:07:21.070 --> 00:07:21.080 

00:07:21.080 --> 00:07:22.809 

this<00:07:21.650> question<00:07:22.069> will<00:07:22.310> be<00:07:22.340> really<00:07:22.639> enough

00:07:22.809 --> 00:07:22.819 
this question will be really enough

00:07:22.819 --> 00:07:26.980 
this question will be really enough
teeth<00:07:23.090> showing<00:07:23.419> but<00:07:25.360> I'm<00:07:26.360> sure<00:07:26.569> this<00:07:26.659> will<00:07:26.720> be

00:07:26.980 --> 00:07:26.990 
teeth showing but I'm sure this will be

00:07:26.990 --> 00:07:41.780 
teeth showing but I'm sure this will be
fine<00:07:27.259> and<00:07:28.479> there<00:07:29.479> we<00:07:30.289> have<00:07:30.319> a<00:07:31.330> shape

00:07:41.780 --> 00:07:41.790 

00:07:41.790 --> 00:07:45.230 

now<00:07:42.270> again<00:07:43.020> I'll<00:07:43.400> we're<00:07:44.400> almost<00:07:44.580> up<00:07:44.910> in<00:07:45.090> that

00:07:45.230 --> 00:07:45.240 
now again I'll we're almost up in that

00:07:45.240 --> 00:07:48.680 
now again I'll we're almost up in that
time<00:07:45.480> so<00:07:46.320> I'm<00:07:46.440> going<00:07:46.830> to<00:07:47.160> stop<00:07:47.970> this<00:07:48.000> tutorial

00:07:48.680 --> 00:07:48.690 
time so I'm going to stop this tutorial

00:07:48.690 --> 00:07:50.090 
time so I'm going to stop this tutorial
and<00:07:48.780> do<00:07:48.960> the<00:07:49.080> rest<00:07:49.200> of<00:07:49.350> the<00:07:49.440> mouth<00:07:49.620> shapes<00:07:49.950> in

00:07:50.090 --> 00:07:50.100 
and do the rest of the mouth shapes in

00:07:50.100 --> 00:07:52.700 
and do the rest of the mouth shapes in
the<00:07:50.220> next<00:07:50.520> one
