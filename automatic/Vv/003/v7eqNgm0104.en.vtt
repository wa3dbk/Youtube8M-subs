00:00:12.560 --> 00:00:12.570 
balancing tool and its claim to fame is

00:00:12.570 --> 00:00:15.200 
balancing tool and its claim to fame is
all<00:00:13.110> of<00:00:13.469> it<00:00:13.590> is<00:00:13.740> in<00:00:14.040> one<00:00:14.280> tool<00:00:14.580> where<00:00:14.940> in<00:00:15.089> the

00:00:15.200 --> 00:00:15.210 
all of it is in one tool where in the

00:00:15.210 --> 00:00:18.200 
all of it is in one tool where in the
old<00:00:15.420> days<00:00:15.830> you<00:00:16.830> had<00:00:16.859> to<00:00:17.070> have<00:00:17.310> one<00:00:17.580> for<00:00:17.820> neutral

00:00:18.200 --> 00:00:18.210 
old days you had to have one for neutral

00:00:18.210 --> 00:00:20.420 
old days you had to have one for neutral
and<00:00:18.420> you<00:00:18.990> had<00:00:19.140> to<00:00:19.289> have<00:00:19.500> another<00:00:20.039> color

00:00:20.420 --> 00:00:20.430 
and you had to have another color

00:00:20.430 --> 00:00:22.519 
and you had to have another color
balancing<00:00:20.970> tool<00:00:21.210> for<00:00:21.600> portrait<00:00:22.109> or<00:00:22.320> a<00:00:22.350> little

00:00:22.519 --> 00:00:22.529 
balancing tool for portrait or a little

00:00:22.529 --> 00:00:24.800 
balancing tool for portrait or a little
warmer<00:00:22.980> so<00:00:23.189> you<00:00:23.250> needed<00:00:23.609> the<00:00:23.730> actual<00:00:24.269> accurate

00:00:24.800 --> 00:00:24.810 
warmer so you needed the actual accurate

00:00:24.810 --> 00:00:27.980 
warmer so you needed the actual accurate
one<00:00:24.990> and<00:00:25.230> then<00:00:25.769> one<00:00:26.039> for<00:00:26.310> more<00:00:26.490> warmer<00:00:27.060> no<00:00:27.720> need

00:00:27.980 --> 00:00:27.990 
one and then one for more warmer no need

00:00:27.990 --> 00:00:29.990 
one and then one for more warmer no need
anymore<00:00:28.320> now<00:00:29.070> we've<00:00:29.340> got<00:00:29.519> the<00:00:29.640> color<00:00:29.820> right

00:00:29.990 --> 00:00:30.000 
anymore now we've got the color right

00:00:30.000 --> 00:00:32.089 
anymore now we've got the color right
max<00:00:30.269> and<00:00:30.570> the<00:00:30.660> way<00:00:30.810> it<00:00:30.960> works<00:00:31.170> is<00:00:31.439> you<00:00:31.470> take<00:00:31.830> one

00:00:32.089 --> 00:00:32.099 
max and the way it works is you take one

00:00:32.099 --> 00:00:33.709 
max and the way it works is you take one
of<00:00:32.219> the<00:00:32.340> filters<00:00:32.700> and<00:00:32.940> it<00:00:33.030> goes<00:00:33.270> right<00:00:33.510> into

00:00:33.709 --> 00:00:33.719 
of the filters and it goes right into

00:00:33.719 --> 00:00:36.560 
of the filters and it goes right into
the<00:00:33.960> slot<00:00:34.230> and<00:00:34.469> it<00:00:35.160> becomes<00:00:35.640> the<00:00:36.300> color

00:00:36.560 --> 00:00:36.570 
the slot and it becomes the color

00:00:36.570 --> 00:00:39.020 
the slot and it becomes the color
balance<00:00:37.050> tool<00:00:37.320> of<00:00:37.530> choice<00:00:37.590> and<00:00:38.309> we've

00:00:39.020 --> 00:00:39.030 
balance tool of choice and we've

00:00:39.030 --> 00:00:41.840 
balance tool of choice and we've
improved<00:00:39.480> even<00:00:40.170> over<00:00:40.410> our<00:00:40.590> old<00:00:40.829> tools<00:00:41.370> is<00:00:41.640> it

00:00:41.840 --> 00:00:41.850 
improved even over our old tools is it

00:00:41.850 --> 00:00:44.240 
improved even over our old tools is it
better<00:00:42.030> than<00:00:42.180> the<00:00:42.329> color<00:00:42.600> right<00:00:42.809> pro<00:00:43.110> yes<00:00:43.590> the

00:00:44.240 --> 00:00:44.250 
better than the color right pro yes the

00:00:44.250 --> 00:00:46.639 
better than the color right pro yes the
white<00:00:44.520> balance<00:00:44.760> is<00:00:45.120> more<00:00:45.719> accurate<00:00:46.050> because

00:00:46.639 --> 00:00:46.649 
white balance is more accurate because

00:00:46.649 --> 00:00:49.430 
white balance is more accurate because
we've<00:00:47.039> got<00:00:47.219> new<00:00:47.670> technology<00:00:48.420> in<00:00:48.660> the<00:00:49.230> color

00:00:49.430 --> 00:00:49.440 
we've got new technology in the color

00:00:49.440 --> 00:00:51.529 
we've got new technology in the color
right<00:00:49.710> max<00:00:50.039> is<00:00:50.280> it<00:00:50.760> better<00:00:50.940> than<00:00:51.090> our<00:00:51.390> old

00:00:51.529 --> 00:00:51.539 
right max is it better than our old

00:00:51.539 --> 00:00:53.990 
right max is it better than our old
caller<00:00:51.899> ID<00:00:52.110> classic<00:00:52.649> yes<00:00:53.070> it's<00:00:53.760> actually

00:00:53.990 --> 00:00:54.000 
caller ID classic yes it's actually

00:00:54.000 --> 00:00:56.360 
caller ID classic yes it's actually
better<00:00:54.390> than<00:00:54.510> that<00:00:54.780> one<00:00:54.989> too<00:00:55.199> because<00:00:55.440> the

00:00:56.360 --> 00:00:56.370 
better than that one too because the

00:00:56.370 --> 00:00:59.240 
better than that one too because the
color<00:00:56.610> balance<00:00:57.090> is<00:00:57.270> more<00:00:57.930> accurate<00:00:58.289> is<00:00:59.010> it

00:00:59.240 --> 00:00:59.250 
color balance is more accurate is it

00:00:59.250 --> 00:01:01.849 
color balance is more accurate is it
better<00:00:59.370> than<00:00:59.520> the<00:00:59.670> popular<00:01:00.210> expo<00:01:00.690> disk<00:01:00.960> yes<00:01:01.559> it

00:01:01.849 --> 00:01:01.859 
better than the popular expo disk yes it

00:01:01.859 --> 00:01:05.539 
better than the popular expo disk yes it
is<00:01:02.190> the<00:01:02.969> new<00:01:03.420> technology<00:01:04.290> has<00:01:04.890> put<00:01:05.250> new

00:01:05.539 --> 00:01:05.549 
is the new technology has put new

00:01:05.549 --> 00:01:08.179 
is the new technology has put new
plastics<00:01:06.180> and<00:01:06.420> the<00:01:06.689> new<00:01:06.900> plastics<00:01:07.500> and<00:01:07.710> the

00:01:08.179 --> 00:01:08.189 
plastics and the new plastics and the

00:01:08.189 --> 00:01:10.250 
plastics and the new plastics and the
new<00:01:08.430> lenses<00:01:08.909> that<00:01:09.119> are<00:01:09.180> in<00:01:09.510> the<00:01:09.780> color<00:01:10.049> right

00:01:10.250 --> 00:01:10.260 
new lenses that are in the color right

00:01:10.260 --> 00:01:14.030 
new lenses that are in the color right
max<00:01:10.619> makes<00:01:11.310> it<00:01:11.580> much<00:01:11.909> more<00:01:12.360> accurate<00:01:13.170> and<00:01:13.380> it

00:01:14.030 --> 00:01:14.040 
max makes it much more accurate and it

00:01:14.040 --> 00:01:16.280 
max makes it much more accurate and it
passes<00:01:14.310> a<00:01:14.549> lot<00:01:14.970> more<00:01:15.360> light<00:01:15.659> through<00:01:15.960> it<00:01:16.110> then

00:01:16.280 --> 00:01:16.290 
passes a lot more light through it then

00:01:16.290 --> 00:01:18.590 
passes a lot more light through it then
let's<00:01:16.470> say<00:01:16.680> the<00:01:16.890> expo<00:01:17.670> disk<00:01:17.909> and<00:01:18.180> what<00:01:18.479> does

00:01:18.590 --> 00:01:18.600 
let's say the expo disk and what does

00:01:18.600 --> 00:01:21.140 
let's say the expo disk and what does
that<00:01:18.630> mean<00:01:18.780> that<00:01:19.170> means<00:01:19.530> you<00:01:20.220> can<00:01:20.490> balance<00:01:20.700> in

00:01:21.140 --> 00:01:21.150 
that mean that means you can balance in

00:01:21.150 --> 00:01:25.399 
that mean that means you can balance in
lower<00:01:21.810> light<00:01:21.960> it<00:01:22.799> comes<00:01:23.280> with<00:01:23.909> four<00:01:24.810> different

00:01:25.399 --> 00:01:25.409 
lower light it comes with four different

00:01:25.409 --> 00:01:26.929 
lower light it comes with four different
ways<00:01:25.590> I<00:01:25.799> was<00:01:25.920> going<00:01:26.100> to<00:01:26.189> say<00:01:26.340> three<00:01:26.670> but<00:01:26.909> it's

00:01:26.929 --> 00:01:26.939 
ways I was going to say three but it's

00:01:26.939 --> 00:01:29.030 
ways I was going to say three but it's
actually<00:01:27.479> four<00:01:27.750> different<00:01:27.990> ways<00:01:28.380> you<00:01:28.680> can

00:01:29.030 --> 00:01:29.040 
actually four different ways you can

00:01:29.040 --> 00:01:30.980 
actually four different ways you can
color<00:01:29.430> balance<00:01:29.880> with<00:01:30.060> the<00:01:30.090> one<00:01:30.420> tool<00:01:30.689> you

00:01:30.980 --> 00:01:30.990 
color balance with the one tool you

00:01:30.990 --> 00:01:33.410 
color balance with the one tool you
don't<00:01:31.200> have<00:01:31.380> to<00:01:31.530> buy<00:01:31.710> different<00:01:32.640> tools<00:01:32.850> we've

00:01:33.410 --> 00:01:33.420 
don't have to buy different tools we've

00:01:33.420 --> 00:01:36.109 
don't have to buy different tools we've
got<00:01:33.720> the<00:01:34.110> color<00:01:34.380> right<00:01:34.590> max<00:01:35.070> and<00:01:35.400> then<00:01:35.700> we<00:01:35.880> have

00:01:36.109 --> 00:01:36.119 
got the color right max and then we have

00:01:36.119 --> 00:01:39.410 
got the color right max and then we have
three<00:01:36.780> additional<00:01:37.439> discs<00:01:38.400> that<00:01:38.460> slide<00:01:39.000> right

00:01:39.410 --> 00:01:39.420 
three additional discs that slide right

00:01:39.420 --> 00:01:42.109 
three additional discs that slide right
into<00:01:39.659> the<00:01:39.900> slot<00:01:40.200> that's<00:01:40.500> built<00:01:40.799> right<00:01:40.890> in<00:01:41.430> so

00:01:42.109 --> 00:01:42.119 
into the slot that's built right in so

00:01:42.119 --> 00:01:45.560 
into the slot that's built right in so
with<00:01:42.479> a<00:01:42.720> by<00:01:43.110> adding<00:01:43.560> one<00:01:43.829> of<00:01:44.009> these<00:01:44.220> in<00:01:44.610> you

00:01:45.560 --> 00:01:45.570 
with a by adding one of these in you

00:01:45.570 --> 00:01:47.810 
with a by adding one of these in you
change<00:01:45.899> it<00:01:46.079> to<00:01:46.200> a<00:01:46.229> portrait<00:01:46.770> mode<00:01:46.950> if<00:01:47.220> you<00:01:47.670> add

00:01:47.810 --> 00:01:47.820 
change it to a portrait mode if you add

00:01:47.820 --> 00:01:49.069 
change it to a portrait mode if you add
one<00:01:48.149> of<00:01:48.180> the<00:01:48.420> other<00:01:48.600> ones<00:01:48.869> you've<00:01:49.049> got

00:01:49.069 --> 00:01:49.079 
one of the other ones you've got

00:01:49.079 --> 00:01:51.889 
one of the other ones you've got
portrait<00:01:49.680> one<00:01:49.920> you've<00:01:50.520> got<00:01:50.549> portrait<00:01:51.270> too<00:01:51.570> and
