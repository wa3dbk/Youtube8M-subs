00:00:10.020 --> 00:00:15.960
 venlo vvv this is a good free 

00:00:12.450 --> 00:00:18.360
 stairs of wall and the rescue of only dad 

00:00:15.960 --> 00:00:20.820
 to walk through from the stream and the ball 

00:00:18.360 --> 00:00:23.400
 ends up again at wall something 

00:00:20.820 --> 00:00:26.689
 passes carlotta take decorated again 

00:00:23.400 --> 00:00:26.689
 a free kick for the Amsterdammers 

00:00:29.100 --> 00:00:33.270
 the highlights from the first half 

00:00:31.950 --> 00:00:35.550
 come mainly from 

00:00:33.270 --> 00:00:38.100
 standard situations 

00:00:35.550 --> 00:00:40.260
 this is the high point number two in 

00:00:38.100 --> 00:00:43.530
 this competition 

00:00:40.260 --> 00:00:45.780
 the young ajax 's second free kick 

00:00:43.530 --> 00:00:46.650
 supporters wall something but also how tough 

00:00:45.780 --> 00:00:50.160
 and also how they 

00:00:46.650 --> 00:00:54.140
 the pole young ajax closest to one 

00:00:50.160 --> 00:00:54.140
 goal in the 1st half in venlo 

00:00:55.680 --> 00:01:01.450
 this is a corner in the 2nd half 

00:00:58.260 --> 00:01:05.199
 the home team posts and there is a slice 

00:01:01.450 --> 00:01:08.200
 long time no see and suddenly there is 

00:01:05.199 --> 00:01:11.040
 moment but the maker of 8 goals 

00:01:08.200 --> 00:01:11.040
 shoot high over 

00:01:11.470 --> 00:01:17.140
 in the second half more chances this is 

00:01:14.140 --> 00:01:20.860
 the food that is trumped by forum 

00:01:17.140 --> 00:01:22.090
 in my god that ball ends up at 

00:01:20.860 --> 00:01:24.130
 carlotta 

00:01:22.090 --> 00:01:26.260
 to fulfill and out of its purpose 

00:01:24.130 --> 00:01:27.670
 incomprehensible because it provides a chance 

00:01:26.260 --> 00:01:30.160
 even though it must touch the pole 

00:01:27.670 --> 00:01:33.160
 there is stick the flat you make a 0 

00:01:30.160 --> 00:01:35.979
 an important goal point wound must be 

00:01:33.160 --> 00:01:39.700
 as many games to win 

00:01:35.979 --> 00:01:43.840
 keep track of the play-offs 

00:01:39.700 --> 00:01:46.060
 good pass just my god what to na 

00:01:43.840 --> 00:01:48.430
 then has in mind that nobody knows 

00:01:46.060 --> 00:01:50.970
 he does leave the post, but vvv 

00:01:48.430 --> 00:01:53.710
 stay focused and flatten you 

00:01:50.970 --> 00:01:57.940
 passes from Brugge 

00:01:53.710 --> 00:01:59.860
 a 0 for the limburgers young ajax 

00:01:57.940 --> 00:02:01.630
 will still get a chance on the 

00:01:59.860 --> 00:02:02.530
 equalizer this is a basis of van 

00:02:01.630 --> 00:02:04.720
 bruges 

00:02:02.530 --> 00:02:06.819
 this is hendriks and it says it all 

00:02:04.720 --> 00:02:07.780
 free acolatse but that does not touch the ball 

00:02:06.819 --> 00:02:10.630
 good 

00:02:07.780 --> 00:02:12.780
 therefore wind with a zero of young 

00:02:10.630 --> 00:02:12.780
 Ajax
