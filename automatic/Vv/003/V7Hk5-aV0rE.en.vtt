a<00:02:31.420> bad<00:02:31.810> alternative<00:02:32.130> so<00:02:33.130> why<00:02:33.580> make<00:02:33.820> this

00:02:34.020 --> 00:02:34.030 
a bad alternative so why make this

00:02:34.030 --> 00:02:35.880 
a bad alternative so why make this
device<00:02:34.330> in<00:02:34.480> the<00:02:34.540> first<00:02:34.750> place<00:02:34.900> it<00:02:35.560> could

accompany the PlayStation 4 on launch

00:02:38.020 --> 00:02:42.210 
accompany the PlayStation 4 on launch
but<00:02:39.010> so<00:02:39.610> could<00:02:39.910> the<00:02:40.150> Vita<00:02:40.390> is<00:02:41.230> this<00:02:41.740> kind<00:02:42.010> of<00:02:42.100> an

00:02:42.210 --> 00:02:42.220 
but so could the Vita is this kind of an

00:02:42.220 --> 00:02:43.710 
but so could the Vita is this kind of an
admission<00:02:42.670> that<00:02:42.700> they've<00:02:42.970> kind<00:02:43.209> of<00:02:43.300> failed<00:02:43.510> in

00:02:43.710 --> 00:02:43.720

the<00:02:43.810> handheld<00:02:44.230> marketer<00:02:44.709> can<00:02:44.740> see<00:02:45.280> that

the handheld marketer can see that

00:02:45.430 --> 00:02:48.690 
the handheld marketer can see that
that's<00:02:45.580> the<00:02:45.760> 3ds<00:02:46.470> possibly<00:02:47.470> it<00:02:47.830> could<00:02:48.130> be<00:02:48.610> an

00:02:48.690 --> 00:02:48.700 
that's the 3ds possibly it could be an

that's the 3ds possibly it could be an
