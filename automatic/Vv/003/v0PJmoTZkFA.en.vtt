00:04:02.250 --> 00:04:02.260 
you think it is that you have four

00:04:02.260 --> 00:04:03.960 
you think it is that you have four
quarterbacks<00:04:02.799> returning<00:04:03.400> so<00:04:03.640> that<00:04:03.819> you

00:04:03.960 --> 00:04:03.970 
quarterbacks returning so that you

00:04:03.970 --> 00:04:08.580 
quarterbacks returning so that you
prefer<00:04:04.930> the<00:04:05.049> wide<00:04:05.200> receivers<00:04:05.680> any<00:04:05.920> I<00:04:07.080> mean<00:04:08.080> the

00:04:08.580 --> 00:04:08.590 
prefer the wide receivers any I mean the

00:04:08.590 --> 00:04:11.070 
prefer the wide receivers any I mean the
UM<00:04:08.920> the<00:04:09.060> quad<00:04:10.060> bikes<00:04:10.239> I'm<00:04:10.450> guess<00:04:10.690> I<00:04:10.810> guess<00:04:10.959> you

00:04:11.070 --> 00:04:11.080 
UM the quad bikes I'm guess I guess you

00:04:11.080 --> 00:04:12.509 
UM the quad bikes I'm guess I guess you
could<00:04:11.110> say<00:04:11.290> we're<00:04:11.440> used<00:04:11.620> to<00:04:11.709> them<00:04:11.860> now<00:04:11.890> I<00:04:12.220> mean

00:04:12.509 --> 00:04:12.519
