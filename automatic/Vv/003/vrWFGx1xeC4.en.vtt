00:00:06.190 --> 00:00:06.200 
hey rhythms drummers here's a really

00:00:06.200 --> 00:00:24.920 
hey rhythms drummers here's a really
easy<00:00:06.410> way<00:00:06.620> to<00:00:06.649> play<00:00:06.920> this<00:00:07.130> tune

00:00:24.920 --> 00:00:24.930 

00:00:24.930 --> 00:00:33.010 

let<00:00:25.930> it<00:00:26.140> go

00:00:33.010 --> 00:00:33.020 

00:00:33.020 --> 00:00:35.299 

let's<00:00:34.020> take<00:00:34.140> a<00:00:34.170> look<00:00:34.350> at<00:00:34.500> this<00:00:34.620> strum<00:00:35.010> pattern

00:00:35.299 --> 00:00:35.309 
let's take a look at this strum pattern

00:00:35.309 --> 00:00:37.040 
let's take a look at this strum pattern
diagram<00:00:35.730> we<00:00:35.910> have<00:00:36.059> here<00:00:36.329> our<00:00:36.360> special

00:00:37.040 --> 00:00:37.050 
diagram we have here our special

00:00:37.050 --> 00:00:38.930 
diagram we have here our special
creation<00:00:37.350> here<00:00:37.920> at<00:00:38.010> rhythm<00:00:38.219> strimmer<00:00:38.460> calm

00:00:38.930 --> 00:00:38.940 
creation here at rhythm strimmer calm

00:00:38.940 --> 00:00:42.979 
creation here at rhythm strimmer calm
we've<00:00:39.750> got<00:00:39.989> these<00:00:40.199> down<00:00:40.680> arrows<00:00:41.340> and<00:00:41.989> let's

00:00:42.979 --> 00:00:42.989 
we've got these down arrows and let's

00:00:42.989 --> 00:00:44.750 
we've got these down arrows and let's
see<00:00:43.170> if<00:00:43.320> you<00:00:43.470> of<00:00:43.559> them<00:00:43.649> have<00:00:43.800> letter<00:00:44.040> bees<00:00:44.370> over

00:00:44.750 --> 00:00:44.760 
see if you of them have letter bees over

00:00:44.760 --> 00:00:47.000 
see if you of them have letter bees over
them<00:00:45.000> and<00:00:45.210> that<00:00:45.300> means<00:00:45.480> to<00:00:45.750> emphasize<00:00:46.170> bass

00:00:47.000 --> 00:00:47.010 
them and that means to emphasize bass

00:00:47.010 --> 00:00:48.770 
them and that means to emphasize bass
strings<00:00:47.489> and<00:00:47.879> if<00:00:47.940> you're<00:00:48.059> really<00:00:48.239> accurate

00:00:48.770 --> 00:00:48.780 
strings and if you're really accurate

00:00:48.780 --> 00:00:51.170 
strings and if you're really accurate
you<00:00:48.989> can<00:00:49.019> emphasize<00:00:49.589> one<00:00:50.190> single<00:00:50.610> bass<00:00:50.760> string

00:00:51.170 --> 00:00:51.180 
you can emphasize one single bass string

00:00:51.180 --> 00:00:53.240 
you can emphasize one single bass string
which<00:00:51.420> would<00:00:51.600> be<00:00:51.720> the<00:00:51.960> root<00:00:52.260> of<00:00:52.769> the<00:00:52.949> chord<00:00:53.159> in

00:00:53.240 --> 00:00:53.250 
which would be the root of the chord in

00:00:53.250 --> 00:00:56.509 
which would be the root of the chord in
this<00:00:53.339> case<00:00:53.550> a<00:00:53.579> CAG<00:00:54.149> an<00:00:55.019> A<00:00:55.320> or<00:00:55.350> an<00:00:55.649> F<00:00:55.829> but<00:00:56.430> if

00:00:56.509 --> 00:00:56.519 
this case a CAG an A or an F but if

00:00:56.519 --> 00:00:58.219 
this case a CAG an A or an F but if
you're<00:00:56.610> not<00:00:56.730> so<00:00:56.879> accurate<00:00:57.329> like<00:00:57.570> I<00:00:57.600> am

00:00:58.219 --> 00:00:58.229 
you're not so accurate like I am

00:00:58.229 --> 00:01:00.469 
you're not so accurate like I am
sometimes<00:00:58.909> then<00:00:59.909> you<00:01:00.059> would<00:01:00.180> just<00:01:00.210> emphasize

00:01:00.469 --> 00:01:00.479 
sometimes then you would just emphasize

00:01:00.479 --> 00:01:02.240 
sometimes then you would just emphasize
bass<00:01:01.110> strings<00:01:01.440> that<00:01:01.559> are<00:01:01.680> kind<00:01:01.860> of<00:01:01.949> in<00:01:02.100> that

00:01:02.240 --> 00:01:02.250 
bass strings that are kind of in that

00:01:02.250 --> 00:01:04.219 
bass strings that are kind of in that
neighborhood<00:01:02.790> so<00:01:03.059> what<00:01:03.809> you're<00:01:03.930> seeing<00:01:04.110> here

00:01:04.219 --> 00:01:04.229 
neighborhood so what you're seeing here

00:01:04.229 --> 00:01:07.640 
neighborhood so what you're seeing here
is<00:01:04.589> down<00:01:05.580> strokes<00:01:06.090> and<00:01:06.450> then<00:01:07.080> after<00:01:07.439> every

00:01:07.640 --> 00:01:07.650 
is down strokes and then after every

00:01:07.650 --> 00:01:09.410 
is down strokes and then after every
fourth<00:01:07.920> down<00:01:08.159> stroke<00:01:08.549> there's<00:01:08.850> an<00:01:09.000> up<00:01:09.150> arrow

00:01:09.410 --> 00:01:09.420 
fourth down stroke there's an up arrow

00:01:09.420 --> 00:01:11.330 
fourth down stroke there's an up arrow
so<00:01:09.840> that's<00:01:10.020> gonna<00:01:10.170> be<00:01:10.290> a<00:01:10.470> rhythm<00:01:10.830> that<00:01:10.979> sounds

00:01:11.330 --> 00:01:11.340 
so that's gonna be a rhythm that sounds

00:01:11.340 --> 00:01:14.270 
so that's gonna be a rhythm that sounds
like<00:01:11.520> this<00:01:11.850> down<00:01:12.570> down<00:01:13.049> down<00:01:13.530> down<00:01:13.860> up<00:01:14.040> down

00:01:14.270 --> 00:01:14.280 
like this down down down down up down

00:01:23.060 --> 00:01:23.070 
down down down down up down let's try it

00:01:23.070 --> 00:01:25.010 
down down down down up down let's try it
on<00:01:23.159> a<00:01:23.189> C<00:01:23.430> chord<00:01:23.640> this<00:01:24.240> is<00:01:24.299> a<00:01:24.450> pattern<00:01:24.720> that'll

00:01:25.010 --> 00:01:25.020 
on a C chord this is a pattern that'll

00:01:25.020 --> 00:01:26.390 
on a C chord this is a pattern that'll
come<00:01:25.170> in<00:01:25.200> handy<00:01:25.320> for<00:01:25.619> a<00:01:25.799> lot<00:01:25.860> of<00:01:26.130> different

00:01:26.390 --> 00:01:26.400 
come in handy for a lot of different

00:01:26.400 --> 00:01:29.270 
come in handy for a lot of different
songs<00:01:26.810> so<00:01:27.810> sound<00:01:28.259> like<00:01:28.409> this<00:01:28.619> on<00:01:28.770> the<00:01:28.829> C<00:01:29.009> chord

00:01:29.270 --> 00:01:29.280 
songs so sound like this on the C chord

00:01:29.280 --> 00:01:36.060 
songs so sound like this on the C chord
down

00:01:36.060 --> 00:01:36.070 

00:01:36.070 --> 00:01:50.000 

john-john

00:01:50.000 --> 00:01:50.010 

00:01:50.010 --> 00:01:54.830 

okay<00:01:51.010> now<00:01:51.730> let's<00:01:52.060> try<00:01:52.480> it<00:01:52.540> on<00:01:52.690> a<00:01:52.750> G<00:01:53.050> chord<00:01:53.760> three

00:01:54.830 --> 00:01:54.840 
okay now let's try it on a G chord three

00:01:54.840 --> 00:02:07.550 
okay now let's try it on a G chord three
four

00:02:07.550 --> 00:02:07.560 

00:02:07.560 --> 00:02:10.070 

and<00:02:08.560> let's<00:02:08.920> do<00:02:09.070> it<00:02:09.100> on<00:02:09.310> an<00:02:09.400> a<00:02:09.520> minor<00:02:09.820> chord

00:02:10.070 --> 00:02:10.080 
and let's do it on an a minor chord

00:02:10.080 --> 00:02:21.330 
and let's do it on an a minor chord
three<00:02:11.100> four

00:02:21.330 --> 00:02:21.340 

00:02:21.340 --> 00:02:27.270 

you<00:02:22.030> get<00:02:22.239> it

00:02:27.270 --> 00:02:27.280 

00:02:27.280 --> 00:02:41.980 

and<00:02:28.280> the<00:02:28.760> F<00:02:28.880> chord

00:02:41.980 --> 00:02:41.990 

00:02:41.990 --> 00:02:43.750 

and<00:02:42.560> now<00:02:42.680> let's<00:02:42.950> put<00:02:43.160> all<00:02:43.190> those<00:02:43.550> together

00:02:43.750 --> 00:02:43.760 
and now let's put all those together

00:02:43.760 --> 00:02:45.520 
and now let's put all those together
I'll<00:02:44.210> play<00:02:44.360> it<00:02:44.480> once<00:02:44.690> through<00:02:44.900> and<00:02:45.290> then<00:02:45.410> I'll

00:02:45.520 --> 00:02:45.530 
I'll play it once through and then I'll

00:02:45.530 --> 00:02:46.720 
I'll play it once through and then I'll
stop<00:02:45.800> and<00:02:46.010> then<00:02:46.100> we'll<00:02:46.190> do<00:02:46.310> it<00:02:46.370> together<00:02:46.520> a

00:02:46.720 --> 00:02:46.730 
stop and then we'll do it together a

00:02:46.730 --> 00:03:05.600 
stop and then we'll do it together a
bunch<00:02:47.210> of<00:02:47.270> times<00:02:47.650> three<00:02:48.650> four

00:03:05.600 --> 00:03:05.610 

00:03:05.610 --> 00:03:07.340 

so<00:03:06.090> I<00:03:06.120> was<00:03:06.270> gonna<00:03:06.330> play<00:03:06.570> it<00:03:06.690> once<00:03:06.990> but<00:03:07.170> can<00:03:07.320> I

00:03:07.340 --> 00:03:07.350 
so I was gonna play it once but can I

00:03:07.350 --> 00:03:08.660 
so I was gonna play it once but can I
played<00:03:07.560> it<00:03:07.650> twice<00:03:07.770> but<00:03:08.130> now<00:03:08.280> let's<00:03:08.520> do<00:03:08.640> it

00:03:08.660 --> 00:03:08.670 
played it twice but now let's do it

00:03:08.670 --> 00:03:24.589 
played it twice but now let's do it
together<00:03:08.790> a<00:03:08.970> bunch<00:03:09.210> of<00:03:09.300> times<00:03:09.510> on<00:03:09.860> the<00:03:11.300> c3<00:03:12.350> for
