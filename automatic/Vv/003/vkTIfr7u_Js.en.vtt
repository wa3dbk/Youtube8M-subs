positioning<00:00:59.250> for<00:00:59.370> HRC<00:00:59.969> and<00:01:00.239> what<00:01:01.199> I<00:01:01.230> find

00:01:01.520 --> 00:01:01.530 
positioning for HRC and what I find

00:01:01.530 --> 00:01:03.439 
positioning for HRC and what I find
funny<00:01:01.710> is<00:01:01.920> that<00:01:01.980> there<00:01:02.280> is<00:01:02.370> no<00:01:02.579> hole<00:01:02.850> for<00:01:03.359> the

00:01:03.439 --> 00:01:03.449 
funny is that there is no hole for the

00:01:03.449 --> 00:01:05.359 
funny is that there is no hole for the
antenna<00:01:03.780> to<00:01:03.960> fit<00:01:04.170> through<00:01:04.470> something<00:01:05.339> you

00:01:05.359 --> 00:01:05.369 
antenna to fit through something you

00:01:05.369 --> 00:01:08.630 
antenna to fit through something you
don't<00:01:05.610> see<00:01:05.760> very<00:01:05.790> often<00:01:06.270> for<00:01:06.810> the<00:01:07.409> RCS<00:01:07.950> Traxxas

00:01:08.630 --> 00:01:08.640

si<00:01:14.369> slash<00:01:14.729> which<00:01:15.090> is<00:01:15.270> kind<00:01:15.689> of<00:01:15.750> disappointing

00:01:16.370 --> 00:01:16.380 
si slash which is kind of disappointing

00:01:16.380 --> 00:01:18.469 
si slash which is kind of disappointing
but<00:01:16.590> I<00:01:17.430> guess<00:01:17.700> they're<00:01:17.909> trying<00:01:17.939> to<00:01:18.270> follow

00:01:18.469 --> 00:01:18.479 
but I guess they're trying to follow

00:01:18.479 --> 00:01:20.420 
but I guess they're trying to follow
that<00:01:18.630> it<00:01:19.140> can<00:01:19.350> be<00:01:19.439> for<00:01:19.619> the<00:01:19.650> slash<00:01:19.950> or<00:01:20.159> Slayer

00:01:20.420 --> 00:01:20.430 
that it can be for the slash or Slayer

00:01:20.430 --> 00:01:24.140 
that it can be for the slash or Slayer
and<00:01:21.229> quite<00:01:22.229> unexpectedly<00:01:22.979> they<00:01:23.340> do<00:01:23.400> include

00:01:24.140 --> 00:01:24.150 
and quite unexpectedly they do include

00:01:24.150 --> 00:01:27.200 
and quite unexpectedly they do include
some<00:01:24.590> masking<00:01:25.590> for<00:01:26.040> your<00:01:26.460> windows<00:01:26.820> so<00:01:27.030> if<00:01:27.119> you

00:01:27.200 --> 00:01:27.210 
some masking for your windows so if you

00:01:27.210 --> 00:01:28.370 
some masking for your windows so if you
want<00:01:27.330> to<00:01:27.390> have<00:01:27.509> clear<00:01:27.720> windows<00:01:28.080> when<00:01:28.259> you

00:01:28.370 --> 00:01:28.380 
want to have clear windows when you

00:01:28.380 --> 00:01:31.490 
want to have clear windows when you
paint<00:01:28.619> it<00:01:28.799> you<00:01:29.400> can<00:01:29.579> do<00:01:29.729> that<00:01:30.079> so<00:01:31.079> I<00:01:31.140> have

00:01:31.490 --> 00:01:31.500 
paint it you can do that so I have

00:01:31.500 --> 00:01:35.149 
paint it you can do that so I have
really<00:01:32.159> no<00:01:32.729> plan<00:01:33.000> for<00:01:33.720> a<00:01:33.750> design<00:01:34.380> I'm<00:01:34.860> just

00:01:35.149 --> 00:01:35.159
