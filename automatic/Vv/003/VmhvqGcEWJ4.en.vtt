cool<00:01:08.670> about<00:01:08.729> this<00:01:09.119> vacuum<00:01:09.299> is<00:01:09.720> with<00:01:09.869> the<00:01:09.960> cord

00:01:10.250 --> 00:01:10.260 
cool about this vacuum is with the cord

00:01:10.260 --> 00:01:16.100 
cool about this vacuum is with the cord
hooks<00:01:11.240> the<00:01:12.240> Bolton<00:01:14.450> then<00:01:15.450> you<00:01:15.570> got<00:01:15.720> the<00:01:15.900> height

00:01:16.100 --> 00:01:16.110 
hooks the Bolton then you got the height

00:01:16.110 --> 00:01:19.160 
hooks the Bolton then you got the height
adjustment<00:01:16.290> there<00:01:16.979> and<00:01:17.509> then<00:01:18.509> you<00:01:18.810> have<00:01:18.930> to

00:01:19.160 --> 00:01:19.170 
adjustment there and then you have to

00:01:19.170 --> 00:01:23.300 
adjustment there and then you have to
handle<00:01:19.530> at<00:01:19.680> least<00:01:19.799> a<00:01:20.450> power<00:01:21.450> button<00:01:21.869> there<00:01:22.310> and

00:01:23.300 --> 00:01:23.310 
handle at least a power button there and

00:01:23.310 --> 00:01:25.690 
handle at least a power button there and
one<00:01:23.820> thing<00:01:24.000> that<00:01:24.150> I<00:01:24.240> think<00:01:24.299> is<00:01:24.689> a<00:01:25.020> little<00:01:25.380> bit

00:01:25.690 --> 00:01:25.700 
one thing that I think is a little bit

00:01:25.700 --> 00:01:29.660 
one thing that I think is a little bit
weird<00:01:26.700> about<00:01:26.880> this<00:01:27.270> is<00:01:27.540> that<00:01:28.229> the<00:01:29.189> handle

00:01:29.660 --> 00:01:29.670 
weird about this is that the handle

00:01:29.670 --> 00:01:31.999 
weird about this is that the handle
slides<00:01:30.030> off<00:01:30.299> so<00:01:30.780> if<00:01:31.079> you<00:01:31.200> wanted<00:01:31.439> to<00:01:31.530> store<00:01:31.860> it

00:01:31.999 --> 00:01:32.009 
slides off so if you wanted to store it

00:01:32.009 --> 00:01:37.340 
slides off so if you wanted to store it
in<00:01:32.189> the<00:01:32.280> cabinet<00:01:32.850> or<00:01:33.000> something<00:01:33.509> you<00:01:34.409> can<00:01:36.350> and

00:01:37.340 --> 00:01:37.350 
in the cabinet or something you can and

00:01:37.350 --> 00:01:39.649 
in the cabinet or something you can and
slide<00:01:38.009> it<00:01:38.159> right<00:01:38.189> back<00:01:38.369> on<00:01:38.729> there<00:01:39.000> and<00:01:39.180> then

00:01:39.649 --> 00:01:39.659 
slide it right back on there and then

00:01:39.659 --> 00:01:44.440 
slide it right back on there and then
you're<00:01:39.960> going<00:01:40.110> to<00:01:40.200> go<00:01:40.700> and<00:01:42.470> as<00:01:43.470> the<00:01:43.770> bag<00:01:43.979> in<00:01:44.220> it

00:01:44.440 --> 00:01:44.450 
you're going to go and as the bag in it

00:01:44.450 --> 00:01:49.160 
you're going to go and as the bag in it
makes<00:01:45.450> type<00:01:46.409> C<00:01:47.090> and<00:01:48.090> need<00:01:48.570> to<00:01:48.720> stuff<00:01:48.960> clean

00:01:49.160 --> 00:01:49.170 
makes type C and need to stuff clean

00:01:49.170 --> 00:01:52.819 
makes type C and need to stuff clean
