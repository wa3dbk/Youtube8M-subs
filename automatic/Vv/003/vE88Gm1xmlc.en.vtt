00:01:03.410 --> 00:01:03.420 
do note that if you there's two similar

00:01:03.420 --> 00:01:04.490 
do note that if you there's two similar
trick<00:01:03.570> shot<00:01:03.750> so<00:01:03.840> i'm<00:01:03.899> trying<00:01:04.110> to<00:01:04.170> choose<00:01:04.320> from

00:01:04.490 --> 00:01:04.500 
trick shot so i'm trying to choose from

00:01:04.500 --> 00:01:05.929 
trick shot so i'm trying to choose from
and<00:01:04.589> one<00:01:04.890> has<00:01:05.040> laser<00:01:05.280> sight<00:01:05.489> and<00:01:05.610> one<00:01:05.700> doesn't

00:01:05.929 --> 00:01:05.939 
and one has laser sight and one doesn't

00:01:05.939 --> 00:01:07.250 
and one has laser sight and one doesn't
obviously<00:01:06.570> I'm<00:01:06.630> going<00:01:06.750> to<00:01:06.840> go<00:01:06.900> over<00:01:06.930> the<00:01:07.140> one

00:01:07.250 --> 00:01:07.260 
obviously I'm going to go over the one

00:01:07.260 --> 00:01:08.690 
obviously I'm going to go over the one
that<00:01:07.380> does<00:01:07.560> not<00:01:07.740> have<00:01:07.950> laser<00:01:08.189> sight<00:01:08.460> because

00:01:08.690 --> 00:01:08.700 
that does not have laser sight because

00:01:08.700 --> 00:01:11.660 
that does not have laser sight because
obviously<00:01:09.450> it<00:01:09.689> takes<00:01:09.780> more<00:01:09.990> skill<00:01:10.610> moving<00:01:11.610> on

00:01:11.660 --> 00:01:11.670 
obviously it takes more skill moving on

00:01:11.670 --> 00:01:14.090 
obviously it takes more skill moving on
to<00:01:11.700> the<00:01:11.820> next<00:01:12.030> class<00:01:12.270> it's<00:01:12.659> a<00:01:12.930> blister<00:01:13.439> with<00:01:13.890> an

00:01:14.090 --> 00:01:14.100 
to the next class it's a blister with an

00:01:14.100 --> 00:01:15.530 
to the next class it's a blister with an
assault<00:01:14.369> shield<00:01:14.670> the<00:01:15.060> wild<00:01:15.270> card<00:01:15.450> is

00:01:15.530 --> 00:01:15.540 
assault shield the wild card is

00:01:15.540 --> 00:01:17.929 
assault shield the wild card is
obviously<00:01:15.869> overkill<00:01:16.350> the<00:01:17.250> rest<00:01:17.430> you<00:01:17.520> can<00:01:17.640> fill

00:01:17.929 --> 00:01:17.939 
obviously overkill the rest you can fill

00:01:17.939 --> 00:01:19.550 
obviously overkill the rest you can fill
in<00:01:18.090> like<00:01:18.299> I<00:01:18.420> said<00:01:18.689> it's<00:01:18.930> up<00:01:19.080> to<00:01:19.229> you<00:01:19.380> how<00:01:19.530> you

00:01:19.550 --> 00:01:19.560 
in like I said it's up to you how you

00:01:19.560 --> 00:01:21.020 
in like I said it's up to you how you

00:01:21.020 --> 00:01:21.030 
want to go about their cameras all that

00:01:21.030 --> 00:01:23.600 
want to go about their cameras all that
I<00:01:21.060> do<00:01:21.240> not<00:01:21.450> mind<00:01:21.659> and<00:01:21.930> the<00:01:22.380> last<00:01:22.590> class<00:01:22.860> is<00:01:23.159> the

00:01:23.600 --> 00:01:23.610 
I do not mind and the last class is the

00:01:23.610 --> 00:01:26.090 
I do not mind and the last class is the
SVU<00:01:24.090> with<00:01:24.630> ballistic<00:01:25.200> knife<00:01:25.380> as<00:01:25.590> a<00:01:25.619> secondary

00:01:26.090 --> 00:01:26.100 
SVU with ballistic knife as a secondary

00:01:26.100 --> 00:01:29.899 
SVU with ballistic knife as a secondary
and<00:01:26.430> combat<00:01:27.180> acts<00:01:27.420> as<00:01:27.659> the<00:01:28.080> lethal<00:01:28.640> alright<00:01:29.640> so

00:01:29.899 --> 00:01:29.909 
and combat acts as the lethal alright so

00:01:29.909 --> 00:01:31.640 
and combat acts as the lethal alright so
to<00:01:29.970> choose<00:01:30.450> one<00:01:30.630> of<00:01:30.659> those<00:01:30.780> three<00:01:30.960> classes<00:01:31.439> to

00:01:31.640 --> 00:01:31.650 
to choose one of those three classes to

00:01:31.650 --> 00:01:32.870 
to choose one of those three classes to
go<00:01:31.770> on<00:01:31.890> like<00:01:32.040> these<00:01:32.159> three<00:01:32.369> maps<00:01:32.549> are<00:01:32.700> the

00:01:32.870 --> 00:01:32.880 
go on like these three maps are the

00:01:32.880 --> 00:01:35.060 
go on like these three maps are the
first<00:01:33.030> one<00:01:33.210> is<00:01:33.240> carrier<00:01:34.040> basically<00:01:35.040> a

00:01:35.060 --> 00:01:35.070 
first one is carrier basically a

00:01:35.070 --> 00:01:36.319 
first one is carrier basically a
straightforward<00:01:35.280> map<00:01:35.610> pretty<00:01:35.939> easy<00:01:36.090> there's

00:01:36.319 --> 00:01:36.329 
straightforward map pretty easy there's

00:01:36.329 --> 00:01:38.330 
straightforward map pretty easy there's
a<00:01:36.360> lot<00:01:36.450> of<00:01:36.479> spots<00:01:36.689> you<00:01:36.810> could<00:01:36.990> choose<00:01:37.560> to<00:01:37.950> hit<00:01:38.310> a

00:01:38.330 --> 00:01:38.340 
a lot of spots you could choose to hit a

00:01:38.340 --> 00:01:40.190 
a lot of spots you could choose to hit a
trick<00:01:38.549> shot<00:01:38.729> from<00:01:38.909> so<00:01:39.240> I'm<00:01:39.390> looking<00:01:39.509> for<00:01:39.840> some

00:01:40.190 --> 00:01:40.200 
trick shot from so I'm looking for some

00:01:40.200 --> 00:01:42.980 
trick shot from so I'm looking for some
creative<00:01:40.470> responses<00:01:40.950> the<00:01:41.790> next<00:01:41.970> map<00:01:42.119> was<00:01:42.659> is

00:01:42.980 --> 00:01:42.990 
creative responses the next map was is

00:01:42.990 --> 00:01:46.160 
creative responses the next map was is
turbine<00:01:43.729> it's<00:01:44.729> a<00:01:44.820> very<00:01:45.030> big<00:01:45.420> map<00:01:45.630> very<00:01:45.960> hot

00:01:46.160 --> 00:01:46.170 
turbine it's a very big map very hot

00:01:46.170 --> 00:01:48.410 
turbine it's a very big map very hot
some<00:01:46.439> high<00:01:46.950> points<00:01:47.189> that<00:01:47.460> you<00:01:47.490> can<00:01:47.640> jump<00:01:48.270> off

00:01:48.410 --> 00:01:48.420 
some high points that you can jump off

00:01:48.420 --> 00:01:49.880 
some high points that you can jump off
and<00:01:48.600> get<00:01:48.689> something<00:01:48.960> really<00:01:49.110> sick<00:01:49.380> so<00:01:49.409> just

00:01:49.880 --> 00:01:49.890 
and get something really sick so just

00:01:49.890 --> 00:01:52.550 
and get something really sick so just
keep<00:01:50.820> that<00:01:50.880> one<00:01:51.090> in<00:01:51.119> mind<00:01:51.360> and<00:01:51.570> the<00:01:52.110> last<00:01:52.350> one

00:01:52.550 --> 00:01:52.560 
keep that one in mind and the last one

00:01:52.560 --> 00:01:56.330 
keep that one in mind and the last one
is<00:01:52.710> raid<00:01:53.130> there's<00:01:53.670> a<00:01:54.090> few<00:01:54.600> spots<00:01:55.189> probably<00:01:56.189> the

00:01:56.330 --> 00:01:56.340 
is raid there's a few spots probably the

00:01:56.340 --> 00:01:57.800 
is raid there's a few spots probably the
one<00:01:56.460> that<00:01:56.610> will<00:01:56.700> be<00:01:56.729> used<00:01:56.969> as<00:01:57.149> the<00:01:57.360> suicide

00:01:57.800 --> 00:01:57.810 
one that will be used as the suicide

00:01:57.810 --> 00:02:00.770 
one that will be used as the suicide
spot<00:01:58.259> so<00:01:59.159> I'm<00:01:59.369> yet<00:01:59.670> just<00:02:00.240> choose<00:02:00.450> one<00:02:00.479> of<00:02:00.630> those

00:02:00.770 --> 00:02:00.780 
spot so I'm yet just choose one of those

00:02:00.780 --> 00:02:02.209 
spot so I'm yet just choose one of those
three<00:02:00.960> maps<00:02:01.170> one<00:02:01.409> of<00:02:01.500> those<00:02:01.590> three<00:02:01.710> classes

00:02:02.209 --> 00:02:02.219 
three maps one of those three classes

00:02:02.219 --> 00:02:03.620 
three maps one of those three classes
get<00:02:02.399> out<00:02:02.520> there<00:02:02.729> hit<00:02:02.880> something<00:02:03.270> and<00:02:03.360> you
