00:02:10.949 --> 00:02:10.959 
is because there wasn't anyone else at

00:02:10.959 --> 00:02:13.979 
is because there wasn't anyone else at
the<00:02:11.080> time<00:02:11.319> making<00:02:12.010> videos<00:02:12.850> for<00:02:13.299> dreadlocks

00:02:13.979 --> 00:02:13.989 
the time making videos for dreadlocks

00:02:13.989 --> 00:02:16.500 
the time making videos for dreadlocks
and<00:02:14.680> natural<00:02:15.310> hair<00:02:15.549> and<00:02:15.880> look<00:02:16.120> there<00:02:16.360> might

00:02:16.500 --> 00:02:16.510 
and natural hair and look there might

00:02:16.510 --> 00:02:18.570 
and natural hair and look there might
have<00:02:16.540> been<00:02:16.660> a<00:02:16.780> few<00:02:16.840> but<00:02:17.500> I<00:02:17.739> just<00:02:18.310> really

00:02:18.570 --> 00:02:18.580 
have been a few but I just really

00:02:18.580 --> 00:02:20.160 
have been a few but I just really
thought<00:02:18.730> I<00:02:18.940> could<00:02:18.970> just<00:02:19.239> jump<00:02:19.420> in<00:02:19.630> and<00:02:19.840> do<00:02:19.989> this

00:02:20.160 --> 00:02:20.170 
thought I could just jump in and do this

00:02:20.170 --> 00:02:24.150 
thought I could just jump in and do this
and<00:02:20.910> surprisingly<00:02:21.910> I<00:02:22.090> would<00:02:22.769> pretty<00:02:23.769> good<00:02:24.010> at
