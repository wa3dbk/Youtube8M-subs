00:00:08.750 --> 00:00:11.669
 welcome to this new episode of 

00:00:10.950 --> 00:00:13.440
 tech news 

00:00:11.669 --> 00:00:16.820
 today is Friday 18 April and we go to 

00:00:13.440 --> 00:00:16.820
 see what news awaits us 

00:00:17.360 --> 00:00:20.930
 google would have decided to redo the look 

00:00:19.100 --> 00:00:22.520
 to android in fact from a few days 

00:00:20.930 --> 00:00:24.260
 images of new ones circulate online 

00:00:22.520 --> 00:00:26.300
 cleaner and minimal system icons e 

00:00:24.260 --> 00:00:28.310
 flat the new style is known as 

00:00:26.300 --> 00:00:31.040
 motion and will probably be introduced 

00:00:28.310 --> 00:00:32.720
 with android 4.5 the google will of 

00:00:31.040 --> 00:00:35.030
 simplify the graphics of your system 

00:00:32.720 --> 00:00:37.040
 mobile has always won the new one too 

00:00:35.030 --> 00:00:38.630
 google camera application use with 

00:00:37.040 --> 00:00:40.820
 the flat round and pastel colors 

00:00:38.630 --> 00:00:42.500
 not to mention google now and its people 

00:00:40.820 --> 00:00:43.970
 different wallpapers in short google sta 

00:00:42.500 --> 00:00:45.770
 trying to amalgamate it the best 

00:00:43.970 --> 00:00:47.809
 style of android and its web services 

00:00:45.770 --> 00:00:49.610
 and to do it in a simple but elegant way 

00:00:47.809 --> 00:00:51.560
 if you want to give a touch of the new theme 

00:00:49.610 --> 00:00:53.780
 to your device on xda are already 

00:00:51.560 --> 00:00:59.000
 present 12 styled system icons 

00:00:53.780 --> 00:01:00.770
 moonshine apple is richer than states 

00:00:59.000 --> 00:01:03.590
 united of the united kingdom and of germany e 

00:01:00.770 --> 00:01:05.449
 The grossing $ 159 billion is 

00:01:03.590 --> 00:01:07.880
 enough to go over 4 times 

00:01:05.449 --> 00:01:08.990
 the availability of Italy's money 

00:01:07.880 --> 00:01:11.270
 the data emerges from a relationship 

00:01:08.990 --> 00:01:13.399
 published by us trust the equivalent 

00:01:11.270 --> 00:01:15.259
 of our treasury ministry in which 

00:01:13.399 --> 00:01:16.820
 you can see a table that compares 

00:01:15.259 --> 00:01:18.950
 cash liquidity of the major companies 

00:01:16.820 --> 00:01:20.960
 US companies and availability 

00:01:18.950 --> 00:01:22.970
 of money from some countries the first 

00:01:20.960 --> 00:01:25.070
 four ie apple microsoft google e 

00:01:22.970 --> 00:01:27.470
 verizon in 2013 have accumulated one 

00:01:25.070 --> 00:01:29.810
 liquidity of 404 billion dollars 

00:01:27.470 --> 00:01:32.630
 exceeding the monetary reserves of the whole 

00:01:29.810 --> 00:01:34.340
 the eurozone amounting to 221 billion 

00:01:32.630 --> 00:01:35.810
 furthermore the report takes into account only 

00:01:34.340 --> 00:01:38.000
 of cash reserves 

00:01:35.810 --> 00:01:39.260
 omitting government bonds, gold reserves 

00:01:38.000 --> 00:01:40.970
 other elements 

00:01:39.260 --> 00:01:42.619
 the us trust has published these data for 

00:01:40.970 --> 00:01:44.659
 demonstrate the solidity of the companies 

00:01:42.619 --> 00:01:46.189
 Americans who rebuilt the 

00:01:44.659 --> 00:01:47.810
 their liquidity positions up to 

00:01:46.189 --> 00:01:48.500
 reach and exceed pre levels 

00:01:47.810 --> 00:01:50.030
 crisis 

00:01:48.500 --> 00:01:53.290
 it would be nice to know if those too 

00:01:50.030 --> 00:01:53.290
 Italians are in the same conditions 

00:01:54.790 --> 00:01:59.150
 roja directa was blocked by order 

00:01:57.470 --> 00:02:00.920
 of the magistrate of padova for now we talk about 

00:01:59.150 --> 00:02:03.020
 block dns but in the coming days 

00:02:00.920 --> 00:02:05.060
 providers should intervene on the p 

00:02:03.020 --> 00:02:06.470
 the site is famous for streaming 

00:02:05.060 --> 00:02:07.909
 sport events 

00:02:06.470 --> 00:02:09.500
 the site of Spanish origin was already 

00:02:07.909 --> 00:02:11.090
 was seized last year for 

00:02:09.500 --> 00:02:13.160
 magistrate order of milan andrea ghinetti 

00:02:11.090 --> 00:02:14.930
 which explained that bringing 

00:02:13.160 --> 00:02:16.670
 illegally transmitted sports events 

00:02:14.930 --> 00:02:18.260
 and that he succeeded in nuclear thanks to 

00:02:16.670 --> 00:02:20.510
 numerous advertisements and 

00:02:18.260 --> 00:02:21.980
 to the high traffic generated for now roja 

00:02:20.510 --> 00:02:23.510
 directa is not reachable but i 

00:02:21.980 --> 00:02:25.400
 defenders of the site boast at least two 

00:02:23.510 --> 00:02:26.060
 victories in the courts of spain and states 

00:02:25.400 --> 00:02:27.050
 united 

00:02:26.060 --> 00:02:28.980
 the basic question is that 

00:02:27.050 --> 00:02:30.569
 indexing is not considered 

00:02:28.980 --> 00:02:34.340
 a direct violation will be curious 

00:02:30.569 --> 00:02:34.340
 see how it will end up in Italy 

00:02:34.879 --> 00:02:39.840
 the iPhone 5 also arrives in our country 

00:02:37.440 --> 00:02:40.769
 c from 8 gigabytes and frankly if not 

00:02:39.840 --> 00:02:43.379
 he missed her 

00:02:40.769 --> 00:02:45.209
 the price of the new model is 579 

00:02:43.379 --> 00:02:47.459
 euro 50 euro less than the version from 

00:02:45.209 --> 00:02:49.200
 16 gigabytes that this minimal difference 

00:02:47.459 --> 00:02:50.879
 price doesn't make it an alternative 

00:02:49.200 --> 00:02:52.500
 valid to many other smartphones that 

00:02:50.879 --> 00:02:55.230
 they can count on the quality ratio 

00:02:52.500 --> 00:02:57.390
 best price as note 3 the nexus 5 

00:02:55.230 --> 00:02:59.549
 the z1 compact all the least expensive of 

00:02:57.390 --> 00:03:01.590
 this was supposed to be the iphone low 

00:02:59.549 --> 00:03:03.180
 cost we talked about in the past 

00:03:01.590 --> 00:03:05.640
 of the bait effect he could have 

00:03:03.180 --> 00:03:07.680
 the iPhone 5 c pushing consumers for 

00:03:05.640 --> 00:03:09.930
 those 100 euros of difference to opt 

00:03:07.680 --> 00:03:11.730
 for the 5 s but maybe we are alone 

00:03:09.930 --> 00:03:13.890
 overestimating the marketing section of 

00:03:11.730 --> 00:03:15.329
 Copertino and 5 there remains a terminal with 

00:03:13.890 --> 00:03:17.370
 very little sales data 

00:03:15.329 --> 00:03:19.349
 encouraging and this variant from 8 

00:03:17.370 --> 00:03:24.180
 gigabytes hardly argue back to 

00:03:19.349 --> 00:03:25.859
 situation in the secret labs of 

00:03:24.180 --> 00:03:27.629
 google ics scientists tried to 

00:03:25.859 --> 00:03:28.709
 realize the space elevator and the 

00:03:27.629 --> 00:03:30.359
 teleportation 

00:03:28.709 --> 00:03:32.310
 but for the moment they have abandoned them 

00:03:30.359 --> 00:03:34.169
 the idea evaluated for the space elevator 

00:03:32.310 --> 00:03:36.090
 was to pull a cable connected to 

00:03:34.169 --> 00:03:37.769
 a satellite fixed in space to tens 

00:03:36.090 --> 00:03:40.169
 thousands of miles above the earth 

00:03:37.769 --> 00:03:41.370
 on which to slide one more cabins 

00:03:40.169 --> 00:03:43.410
 able to transport the material 

00:03:41.370 --> 00:03:45.000
 passengers the problem lies in the 

00:03:43.410 --> 00:03:46.739
 materials the space cable should 

00:03:45.000 --> 00:03:48.569
 being 100 times more resistant than 

00:03:46.739 --> 00:03:49.980
 best steel available one 

00:03:48.569 --> 00:03:52.200
 solution had been found in the nanotubes 

00:03:49.980 --> 00:03:53.940
 of carbon but for now it has never been 

00:03:52.200 --> 00:03:54.810
 produced a filament so long with 

00:03:53.940 --> 00:03:57.419
 this material 

00:03:54.810 --> 00:03:58.829
 so the project is stand by the other 

00:03:57.419 --> 00:04:00.239
 science fiction dream to which google 

00:03:58.829 --> 00:04:02.010
 hicks tried to give life to the 

00:04:00.239 --> 00:04:03.930
 teleportation just like that of 

00:04:02.010 --> 00:04:05.519
 star trek the problem after some 

00:04:03.930 --> 00:04:07.260
 study found that this concept 

00:04:05.519 --> 00:04:09.450
 violates different laws of physics 

00:04:07.260 --> 00:04:11.250
 the last bad news that it is not 

00:04:09.450 --> 00:04:12.690
 Possible to realize the over board 

00:04:11.250 --> 00:04:14.010
 also here because there are laws of 

00:04:12.690 --> 00:04:15.870
 physics that science fiction can 

00:04:14.010 --> 00:04:17.729
 afford to ignore but we common 

00:04:15.870 --> 00:04:19.470
 So let's not know some of the mortals 

00:04:17.729 --> 00:04:20.789
 projects that have been dropped would be 

00:04:19.470 --> 00:04:22.710
 nice to know what's cooking 

00:04:20.789 --> 00:04:24.419
 because if this is the order of ideas a 

00:04:22.710 --> 00:04:28.039
 where google scientists work 

00:04:24.419 --> 00:04:28.039
 we must expect good ones 

00:04:29.000 --> 00:04:32.390
 and this tech news episode has come 

00:04:30.800 --> 00:04:34.160
 at the end I thank you as usual 

00:04:32.390 --> 00:04:35.450
 do not forget for your company 

00:04:34.160 --> 00:04:37.130
 to leave your opinions of 

00:04:35.450 --> 00:04:39.050
 like and subscribe to the channel 

00:04:37.130 --> 00:04:40.520
 of tom's hardware italy and maybe do 

00:04:39.050 --> 00:04:42.500
 a jump even on my own I take the opportunity 

00:04:40.520 --> 00:04:44.680
 to wish you a happy Easter 

00:04:42.500 --> 00:04:44.680
 next
