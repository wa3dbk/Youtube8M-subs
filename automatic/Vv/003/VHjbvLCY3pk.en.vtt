00:00:06.090 --> 00:00:10.500
 the price of an implant is relatively variable depending on the flow rates 

00:00:10.500 --> 00:00:14.800
 French geographical regions according to practitioners to go 

00:00:14.800 --> 00:00:17.800
 consult a recent study tf1 

00:00:18.800 --> 00:00:22.000
 in a professional journal and I do not know which one he uses his own 

00:00:22.000 --> 00:00:23.580
 and the average price 

00:00:23.580 --> 00:00:27.230
 in France for laurent blanc and the prosthesis that comes from 

00:00:27.230 --> 00:00:28.610
 northern replacement 

00:00:28.610 --> 00:00:31.650
 m average between them was half the water 

00:00:32.390 --> 00:00:35.830
 so we tried we can consider that the average price 

00:00:36.330 --> 00:00:40.670
 and 2000 euros for the surgical break of the plant and thousand euros for the pose 

00:00:40.670 --> 00:00:44.640
 of the prosthesis which usually includes a killer and a crown 

00:00:47.950 --> 00:00:50.790
 the victims are a couple between different practitioners 

00:00:50.790 --> 00:00:52.640
 but we can not let it know 

00:00:52.640 --> 00:00:55.520
 we do not have the opportunity to advertise have reached the site and of

00:00:59.110 --> 00:01:02.850
 it's a good thing for me to bite the change all that in the blood 

00:01:03.350 --> 00:01:07.860
 who is there to manage you put the limits and put limits 

00:01:08.360 --> 00:01:09.799
 main asset to know 

00:01:09.799 --> 00:01:13.080
 and it's not bad anymore because I really want to tampa bay de saintes 

00:01:13.080 --> 00:01:16.430
 because these things look really good well framed 

00:01:16.430 --> 00:01:19.430
 what my point of view is a rascal 

00:01:22.010 --> 00:01:24.920
 so it's a themed evening and that can not be known 

00:01:24.920 --> 00:01:28.220
 so the first step is to already play against 10 but I'm a 

00:01:28.220 --> 00:01:30.630
 pastor the competition between distribution 

00:01:30.630 --> 00:01:33.550
 but the first lent her trusting relationship

 cl milk skills 

00:01:37.100 --> 00:01:39.600
 I trained at 120 euros for the price 

00:01:39.600 --> 00:01:41.540
 this was his rate 

00:01:41.540 --> 00:01:45.620
 we played on his back without 305 euros but as it is a collateral are 20 

00:01:45.620 --> 00:01:47.170
 at 30 years old 

00:01:47.170 --> 00:01:50.170
 it's little in the face 

00:01:51.540 --> 00:01:55.060
 taxes are not reimbursed by social security contrary to 

00:01:55.060 --> 00:01:56.840
 several European countries 

00:01:56.840 --> 00:02:00.950
 where the local social security guide system reimburses them 

00:02:00.950 --> 00:02:03.619
 but more and more a mutual 

00:02:03.619 --> 00:02:06.990
 and the prelate not participated in the defense of the white man 

00:02:06.990 --> 00:02:08.860
 unfortunately it's still 

00:02:08.860 --> 00:02:09.789
 so 

00:02:09.789 --> 00:02:13.229
 2 too much for a woman that's it's not widespread enough are usually

 mutual societies 2 of society 

00:02:15.670 --> 00:02:22.780
 and it would be necessary that the cc repayment system the private face a 

00:02:22.780 --> 00:02:24.109
 extra effort 

00:02:24.109 --> 00:02:27.109
 to redevelop the reimbursement of implants 

00:02:29.349 --> 00:02:30.870
 you want to replace a dance 

00:02:30.870 --> 00:02:34.050
 you have tonight the team of troyes in this corner of a plane the cost of the 

00:02:34.049 --> 00:02:37.170
 dependence on the expense it's exactly the same what will happen in 

00:02:37.170 --> 00:02:38.109
 Europe 

00:02:38.109 --> 00:02:41.230
 who more and the only ones to differentiate the two solutions 

00:02:41.230 --> 00:02:44.680
 it's the reimbursement of patients and therefore what will actually stay at its 

00:02:44.680 --> 00:02:49.349
 charge and we have patients who choose the bridge option I want 

00:02:49.349 --> 00:02:53.690
 simply because the final cost remains at their expense and clearly 

00:02:53.690 --> 00:02:56.690
 lower because of the deferrals 

00:02:58.709 --> 00:03:01.610
 really interesting and that's a public health problem
