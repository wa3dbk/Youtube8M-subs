00:00:07.919 --> 00:00:17.190
 invented that I named note to whitney 

00:00:14.690 --> 00:00:19.410
 christiaens so that's it's a 

00:00:17.190 --> 00:00:20.939
 pretty original question if you want 

00:00:19.410 --> 00:00:23.369

00:00:20.939 --> 00:00:26.279
 can but in info bar throw to 

00:00:23.369 --> 00:00:27.689
 I'm sure some people 

00:00:26.279 --> 00:00:31.890
 that they are beautiful objects do them but 

00:00:27.689 --> 00:00:33.329
 good it would still be cool so he 

00:00:31.890 --> 00:00:35.820
 are ten questions and I'm going to start 

00:00:33.329 --> 00:00:37.860
 immediately so first question 

00:00:35.820 --> 00:00:40.200
 what is your favorite season and 

00:00:37.860 --> 00:00:42.360
 why then the split prevent 

00:00:40.200 --> 00:00:45.059
 select because it's nice and hot 

00:00:42.360 --> 00:00:48.090

00:00:45.059 --> 00:00:50.430

00:00:48.090 --> 00:00:52.739
 in demon can not go and buy 

00:00:50.430 --> 00:00:54.899
 stuff we can go we can do some 

00:00:52.739 --> 00:00:56.789
 videos we can read quietly we can 

00:00:54.899 --> 00:01:00.539
 watch TV every night we can 

00:00:56.789 --> 00:01:03.090
 eve etc. must then question two 

00:01:00.539 --> 00:01:05.610
 sites the first name of your first 

00:01:03.090 --> 00:01:08.549
 best friend just told me as we 

00:01:05.610 --> 00:01:09.420

00:01:08.549 --> 00:01:11.310
 many 

00:01:09.420 --> 00:01:13.320
 in fact at the same time but it seems to me 

00:01:11.310 --> 00:01:16.650
 that first first that was 

00:01:13.320 --> 00:01:19.020
 lola then tell us the dream the 

00:01:16.650 --> 00:01:23.520
 more weird than you were I did not 

00:01:19.020 --> 00:01:26.130
 weird dream hurt but I'll get you in 

00:01:23.520 --> 00:01:27.659
 tell a qg so note that I wanted 

00:01:26.130 --> 00:01:28.979
 what I scored I did in two 

00:01:27.659 --> 00:01:30.149
 what we wanted to lose my time 

00:01:28.979 --> 00:01:33.960
 but I remember it as if it were 

00:01:30.149 --> 00:01:35.880
 yesterday - co then for my birthday 

00:01:33.960 --> 00:01:39.600
 I was going to have a kitten but I do not 

00:01:35.880 --> 00:01:41.429
 I did not see it was with my daddy 

00:01:39.600 --> 00:01:44.009
 went as in a factory looked for 

00:01:41.429 --> 00:01:46.079
 the owner does not find it for 

00:01:44.009 --> 00:01:47.149
 search have searched one go in a 

00:01:46.079 --> 00:01:49.469
 factory 

00:01:47.149 --> 00:01:51.859
 there were plenty of kittens we 

00:01:49.469 --> 00:01:54.659
 find the owner does not find 

00:01:51.859 --> 00:01:56.299
 and there the rule c cut so here is 

00:01:54.659 --> 00:01:58.950
 it's very weird 

00:01:56.299 --> 00:02:02.520
 so I woke up I believe me 

00:01:58.950 --> 00:02:05.129
 I'm bad and then what is the 

00:02:02.520 --> 00:02:08.759
 color of your pajamas my pajamas and gray 

00:02:05.129 --> 00:02:11.569
 with little ones and the white titille and 

00:02:08.759 --> 00:02:13.980
 choirs oms 

00:02:11.569 --> 00:02:17.340
 then you prefer to climb the steps 

00:02:13.980 --> 00:02:19.799
 two by two one by one with one foot 

00:02:17.340 --> 00:02:22.260
 by walking or a haunting bar 

00:02:19.799 --> 00:02:25.349
 and 2t on a walk I do not understand 

00:02:22.260 --> 00:02:27.299
 try bat angers I beg you since 

00:02:25.349 --> 00:02:30.170
 it's me who made the question but 

00:02:27.299 --> 00:02:30.170
 I will still try 

00:02:48.370 --> 00:02:54.080
 so me the answer is I prefer 

00:02:51.170 --> 00:02:56.300
 climb the stairs two by two otherwise 

00:02:54.080 --> 00:02:57.860
 it's a year ago I'm getting great on my 

00:02:56.300 --> 00:03:01.250
 stairs but for example the stairs 

00:02:57.860 --> 00:03:02.630
 College I can not gets there 

00:03:01.250 --> 00:03:04.610
 no pardon I find it too much 

00:03:02.630 --> 00:03:08.270
 complicated especially when we have a bag on 

00:03:04.610 --> 00:03:10.040
 the back so here is a vote we made you 

00:03:08.270 --> 00:03:12.730
 our little sport and honestly that 

00:03:10.040 --> 00:03:15.470
 really tired be two stalls 

00:03:12.730 --> 00:03:16.970
 So that's what you think 

00:03:15.470 --> 00:03:19.880
 when you are told the English word 

00:03:16.970 --> 00:03:22.340
 so I think about my family is 

00:03:19.880 --> 00:03:25.160
 English here is my disturbance all pink 

00:03:22.340 --> 00:03:28.220
 then I think about my English teacher and 

00:03:25.160 --> 00:03:32.710
 Then I think of the little mix at the Ats 

00:03:28.220 --> 00:03:35.000
 pascal london we raise then chosen 

00:03:32.710 --> 00:03:38.330
 chosen in only beauty products is 

00:03:35.000 --> 00:03:41.360
 a varnished salt that you prefer and if you 

00:03:38.330 --> 00:03:44.630
 have a choosy boy in play or that's it 

00:03:41.360 --> 00:03:47.240
 so well I'll go get it then 

00:03:44.630 --> 00:03:53.900
 my favorite nail polish I will show you 

00:03:47.240 --> 00:03:56.720
 where already I'm full I g27 varnish 

00:03:53.900 --> 00:03:58.280
 feel last I preferred I do not have 

00:03:56.720 --> 00:03:59.690
 unused because I had them in 

00:03:58.280 --> 00:04:03.770
 not long ago and it was more the 

00:03:59.690 --> 00:04:05.660
 vacation so it's this one that comes 

00:04:03.770 --> 00:04:10.250
 from sephora there you do not see 

00:04:05.660 --> 00:04:12.950
 quite the same color so his name 

00:04:10.250 --> 00:04:14.420
 equip myself closed post in edition 

00:04:12.950 --> 00:04:18.350
 limited move in the mecca cap 

00:04:14.420 --> 00:04:20.209
 academy nail art so nails actually but 

00:04:18.350 --> 00:04:22.130
 it's not the same color I'd like 

00:04:20.209 --> 00:04:23.110
 well have a little you do it again because 

00:04:22.130 --> 00:04:25.970
 he is my favorite player 

00:04:23.110 --> 00:04:27.620
 I do not have it otherwise I chose a 

00:04:25.970 --> 00:04:29.990
 product for the lips and a product 

00:04:27.620 --> 00:04:33.890
 for eyes 

00:04:29.990 --> 00:04:37.640
 we chose this lipstick 

00:04:33.890 --> 00:04:43.120
 there is actually one who comes from 

00:04:37.640 --> 00:04:46.210
 yves rock is actually according number 

00:04:43.120 --> 00:04:48.870
 it's number 13 but you do not see 

00:04:46.210 --> 00:04:48.870
 the same color 

00:04:50.850 --> 00:04:54.639
 yeah then see toulalan colors in 

00:04:53.380 --> 00:04:57.310
 does it's almost the same color as 

00:04:54.639 --> 00:05:00.010
 the lips but in everything like that it's 

00:04:57.310 --> 00:05:02.199
 Too beautiful and in addition it feels too soft 

00:05:00.010 --> 00:05:04.000
 feel the sulfur here for my lips that 

00:05:02.199 --> 00:05:06.790
 you prefer and then it's a 

00:05:04.000 --> 00:05:08.500
 product then it's not interfering so 

00:05:06.790 --> 00:05:10.030
 there I not set you preferred but 

00:05:08.500 --> 00:05:12.960
 you make yourself that you come in this 

00:05:10.030 --> 00:05:15.820
 question I put you something like 

00:05:12.960 --> 00:05:18.510
 essential and me the mascara that I 

00:05:15.820 --> 00:05:20.770
 will show it's not my favorite 

00:05:18.510 --> 00:05:23.050
 so I took the first prize of 

00:05:20.770 --> 00:05:24.580
 at yves rock because he 

00:05:23.050 --> 00:05:25.750
 needed an emergency and I had not 

00:05:24.580 --> 00:05:26.560
 a lot of sous then suddenly I had 

00:05:25.750 --> 00:05:29.740
 the first prize 

00:05:26.560 --> 00:05:31.930
 so the brush I twisted i had 

00:05:29.740 --> 00:05:34.840
 was not on purpose and besides that 

00:05:31.930 --> 00:05:36.610
 annoy me well and so it's not and n is 

00:05:34.840 --> 00:05:38.680
 not he is not great but I find 

00:05:36.610 --> 00:05:39.840
 that it is an indispensable so that's it 

00:05:38.680 --> 00:05:43.780
 all that for that I do not you 

00:05:39.840 --> 00:05:45.850
 present them and so it cost me 3 

00:05:43.780 --> 00:05:46.090
 euros 50 chf 3 or between like that or 4 

00:05:45.850 --> 00:05:49.180

00:05:49.180 --> 00:05:51.849

00:06:51.600 --> 00:06:56.100
 gay on a little more complex if you 

00:06:53.850 --> 00:06:58.470
 would have been someone other than that 

00:06:56.100 --> 00:07:01.140
 what are you today who would you have 

00:06:58.470 --> 00:07:02.880
 loved to be so I'm not going to quote two 

00:07:01.140 --> 00:07:04.410
 stars or anything but it's 

00:07:02.880 --> 00:07:06.780
 true that I would have liked to be a girl 

00:07:04.410 --> 00:07:09.450
 already English because or American 

00:07:06.780 --> 00:07:10.440
 perhaps because it is the language 20 

00:07:09.450 --> 00:07:12.330
 everyone is talking 

00:07:10.440 --> 00:07:15.120
 and if for example you are a singer or 

00:07:12.330 --> 00:07:16.680
 if you are an actor and down there is the 

00:07:15.120 --> 00:07:18.090
 entire world almost who will you 

00:07:16.680 --> 00:07:20.100
 watch mix you are an actor 

00:07:18.090 --> 00:07:21.960
