00:03:06.970 --> 00:03:06.980 
to download it all the time that's

00:03:06.980 --> 00:03:08.380 
to download it all the time that's
really<00:03:07.160> aggravating

00:03:08.380 --> 00:03:08.390 
really aggravating

00:03:08.390 --> 00:03:10.750 
really aggravating

00:03:13.860 --> 00:03:13.870 
guess that's pretty cool

00:03:13.870 --> 00:03:16.450 
guess that's pretty cool
now<00:03:14.870> I<00:03:14.900> complained<00:03:15.470> when<00:03:15.740> I<00:03:15.800> played<00:03:16.160> with<00:03:16.310> this

00:03:16.450 --> 00:03:16.460 
now I complained when I played with this

00:03:16.460 --> 00:03:18.130 
now I complained when I played with this
at<00:03:16.760> CTIA<00:03:17.150> when<00:03:17.600> I<00:03:17.630> played<00:03:17.870> it<00:03:17.990> on<00:03:18.080> the

00:03:18.130 --> 00:03:18.140 
at CTIA when I played it on the

00:03:18.140 --> 00:03:21.130 
at CTIA when I played it on the
blackberry<00:03:18.500> pearl<00:03:18.800> that<00:03:19.640> it<00:03:20.360> wasn't<00:03:20.720> any<00:03:20.960> good

00:03:21.130 --> 00:03:21.140 
blackberry pearl that it wasn't any good

00:03:21.140 --> 00:03:23.410 
blackberry pearl that it wasn't any good
this<00:03:21.680> seems<00:03:21.950> much<00:03:22.340> much<00:03:22.610> better

00:03:23.410 --> 00:03:23.420 
this seems much much better

00:03:23.420 --> 00:03:25.360 
this seems much much better
I<00:03:23.450> assume<00:03:24.260> that's<00:03:24.440> partially<00:03:24.770> because<00:03:25.070> it's

00:03:25.360 --> 00:03:25.370 
I assume that's partially because it's

00:03:25.370 --> 00:03:28.510 
I assume that's partially because it's
got<00:03:25.550> a<00:03:25.750> faster<00:03:26.750> processor<00:03:27.260> but<00:03:28.220> it<00:03:28.310> might<00:03:28.490> also

00:03:28.510 --> 00:03:28.520 
got a faster processor but it might also

00:03:28.520 --> 00:03:30.970 
got a faster processor but it might also
just<00:03:29.120> be<00:03:29.330> that<00:03:29.540> I'm<00:03:29.750> better<00:03:29.960> at<00:03:30.200> it<00:03:30.380> because<00:03:30.680> I

00:03:30.970 --> 00:03:30.980 
just be that I'm better at it because I

00:03:30.980 --> 00:03:32.410 
just be that I'm better at it because I
actually<00:03:31.190> sat<00:03:31.610> down<00:03:31.640> and<00:03:31.790> played<00:03:32.030> it<00:03:32.210> instead

00:03:32.410 --> 00:03:32.420 
actually sat down and played it instead

00:03:32.420 --> 00:03:34.360 
actually sat down and played it instead
of<00:03:32.510> playing<00:03:32.720> it<00:03:32.840> at<00:03:32.930> a<00:03:32.960> party<00:03:33.320> so<00:03:33.530> I<00:03:33.770> can't<00:03:34.220> say

00:03:34.360 --> 00:03:34.370 
of playing it at a party so I can't say

00:03:34.370 --> 00:03:35.830 
of playing it at a party so I can't say
definitively<00:03:34.610> that<00:03:34.940> this<00:03:35.210> is<00:03:35.360> better<00:03:35.540> than

00:03:35.830 --> 00:03:35.840 
definitively that this is better than

00:03:35.840 --> 00:03:38.410 
definitively that this is better than
the<00:03:35.990> BlackBerry<00:03:36.650> version<00:03:37.040> but<00:03:37.250> I<00:03:37.550> can<00:03:38.120> say<00:03:38.330> it

00:03:38.410 --> 00:03:38.420 
the BlackBerry version but I can say it

00:03:38.420 --> 00:03:39.790 
the BlackBerry version but I can say it
with<00:03:38.540> a<00:03:38.600> relatively<00:03:39.080> high<00:03:39.350> degree<00:03:39.380> of
