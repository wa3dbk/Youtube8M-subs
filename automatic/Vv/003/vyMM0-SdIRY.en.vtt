global<00:00:10.500> trailer<00:00:11.240> so<00:00:12.240> when<00:00:12.870> I<00:00:12.900> initially<00:00:13.349> made

00:00:13.789 --> 00:00:13.799 
global trailer so when I initially made

00:00:13.799 --> 00:00:15.680 
global trailer so when I initially made
my<00:00:13.980> breakdown<00:00:14.250> for<00:00:14.639> the<00:00:14.700> trailer<00:00:15.059> I<00:00:15.240> said<00:00:15.509> that

00:00:15.680 --> 00:00:15.690 
my breakdown for the trailer I said that

00:00:15.690 --> 00:00:17.510 
my breakdown for the trailer I said that
I<00:00:15.719> thought<00:00:15.990> that<00:00:16.049> the<00:00:16.379> indominus<00:00:16.710> rex<00:00:16.980> was<00:00:17.369> the

00:00:17.510 --> 00:00:17.520 
I thought that the indominus rex was the

00:00:17.520 --> 00:00:18.980 
I thought that the indominus rex was the
dinosaur<00:00:17.820> that<00:00:18.000> was<00:00:18.119> chasing<00:00:18.390> Claire

00:00:18.980 --> 00:00:18.990 
dinosaur that was chasing Claire

00:00:18.990 --> 00:00:21.320 
dinosaur that was chasing Claire
now<00:00:19.619> after<00:00:19.859> a<00:00:20.100> lot<00:00:20.490> of<00:00:20.580> you<00:00:20.699> have<00:00:20.850> pointed<00:00:21.029> out

00:00:21.320 --> 00:00:21.330 
now after a lot of you have pointed out

00:00:21.330 --> 00:00:23.060 
now after a lot of you have pointed out
that<00:00:21.480> you<00:00:21.539> guys<00:00:21.750> didn't<00:00:22.289> think<00:00:22.320> it<00:00:22.590> was<00:00:22.740> the

00:00:23.060 --> 00:00:23.070 
that you guys didn't think it was the

00:00:23.070 --> 00:00:24.560 
that you guys didn't think it was the
indominus<00:00:23.400> rex<00:00:23.699> that<00:00:24.029> you<00:00:24.119> thought<00:00:24.300> it<00:00:24.420> was

00:00:24.560 --> 00:00:24.570 
indominus rex that you thought it was

00:00:24.570 --> 00:00:28.640 
indominus rex that you thought it was
another<00:00:25.380> larger<00:00:25.859> theropod<00:00:26.369> I<00:00:27.320> decided<00:00:28.320> to<00:00:28.500> go

00:00:28.640 --> 00:00:28.650 
another larger theropod I decided to go

00:00:28.650 --> 00:00:30.140 
another larger theropod I decided to go
back<00:00:28.800> and<00:00:29.039> take<00:00:29.250> another<00:00:29.279> look<00:00:29.580> and<00:00:29.970> sure

00:00:30.140 --> 00:00:30.150 
back and take another look and sure

00:00:30.150 --> 00:00:31.880 
back and take another look and sure
enough<00:00:30.179> you<00:00:30.510> guys<00:00:30.630> were<00:00:30.990> absolutely<00:00:31.260> right<00:00:31.830> I

00:00:31.880 --> 00:00:31.890 
enough you guys were absolutely right I

00:00:31.890 --> 00:00:34.610 
enough you guys were absolutely right I
mean<00:00:32.309> if<00:00:33.180> you<00:00:33.360> compare<00:00:33.840> the<00:00:34.050> indominus<00:00:34.350> rex

00:00:34.610 --> 00:00:34.620 
mean if you compare the indominus rex

00:00:34.620 --> 00:00:37.459 
mean if you compare the indominus rex
his<00:00:34.950> feet<00:00:35.219> to<00:00:35.520> this<00:00:35.730> dinosaurs<00:00:36.570> feet<00:00:36.840> they

00:00:37.459 --> 00:00:37.469 
his feet to this dinosaurs feet they

00:00:37.469 --> 00:00:40.190 
his feet to this dinosaurs feet they
don't<00:00:37.680> match<00:00:37.860> up<00:00:37.890> at<00:00:38.250> all<00:00:38.370> and<00:00:38.660> the<00:00:39.660> majority

00:00:40.190 --> 00:00:40.200 
don't match up at all and the majority

00:00:40.200 --> 00:00:41.660 
don't match up at all and the majority
of<00:00:40.230> you<00:00:40.410> guys<00:00:40.440> were<00:00:40.860> absolutely<00:00:41.010> right<00:00:41.640> I

00:00:41.660 --> 00:00:41.670 
of you guys were absolutely right I

00:00:41.670 --> 00:00:44.750 
of you guys were absolutely right I
definitely<00:00:41.879> think<00:00:42.600> now<00:00:42.870> that<00:00:42.899> the<00:00:43.760> dinosaur

00:00:44.750 --> 00:00:44.760 
definitely think now that the dinosaur

00:00:44.760 --> 00:00:46.729 
definitely think now that the dinosaur
that<00:00:44.910> is<00:00:45.059> chasing<00:00:45.420> Claire<00:00:45.840> is<00:00:46.050> definitely<00:00:46.590> the

00:00:46.729 --> 00:00:46.739 
that is chasing Claire is definitely the

00:00:46.739 --> 00:00:49.790 
that is chasing Claire is definitely the
t-rex<00:00:47.010> now<00:00:47.910> this<00:00:48.239> goes<00:00:48.989> along<00:00:49.230> with<00:00:49.590> it

00:00:49.790 --> 00:00:49.800 
t-rex now this goes along with it

00:00:49.800 --> 00:00:52.279 
t-rex now this goes along with it
because<00:00:50.190> of<00:00:50.879> course<00:00:51.149> we've<00:00:51.420> seen<00:00:51.480> Claire<00:00:52.050> and

00:00:52.279 --> 00:00:52.289 
because of course we've seen Claire and

00:00:52.289 --> 00:00:54.860 
because of course we've seen Claire and
the<00:00:52.350> other<00:00:52.500> trailers<00:00:52.980> with<00:00:53.969> the<00:00:54.149> flare<00:00:54.570> as

00:00:54.860 --> 00:00:54.870 
the other trailers with the flare as

00:00:54.870 --> 00:00:56.750 
the other trailers with the flare as
she's<00:00:55.110> trying<00:00:55.350> to<00:00:55.530> lead<00:00:55.770> the<00:00:55.980> t-rex<00:00:56.370> out<00:00:56.640> of

00:00:56.750 --> 00:00:56.760 
she's trying to lead the t-rex out of

00:00:56.760 --> 00:01:00.200 
she's trying to lead the t-rex out of
t-rex<00:00:57.180> Kingdom<00:00:57.660> supposedly<00:00:58.640> most<00:00:59.640> likely<00:01:00.059> to

00:01:00.200 --> 00:01:00.210 
t-rex Kingdom supposedly most likely to

00:01:00.210 --> 00:01:02.510 
t-rex Kingdom supposedly most likely to
go<00:01:00.390> out<00:01:00.420> and<00:01:00.809> fight<00:01:01.050> the<00:01:01.230> indominus<00:01:01.530> rex<00:01:01.890> as<00:01:02.250> a

00:01:02.510 --> 00:01:02.520 
go out and fight the indominus rex as a

00:01:02.520 --> 00:01:05.390 
go out and fight the indominus rex as a
last<00:01:02.850> resort<00:01:03.530> for<00:01:04.530> the<00:01:04.619> big<00:01:04.739> finale<00:01:04.920> of<00:01:05.189> the

00:01:05.390 --> 00:01:05.400 
last resort for the big finale of the

00:01:05.400 --> 00:01:08.270 
last resort for the big finale of the
movie<00:01:05.729> so<00:01:06.390> yes<00:01:06.990> this<00:01:07.229> is<00:01:07.290> probably<00:01:07.799> the<00:01:08.010> scene

00:01:08.270 --> 00:01:08.280 
movie so yes this is probably the scene

00:01:08.280 --> 00:01:10.310 
movie so yes this is probably the scene
that<00:01:08.460> is<00:01:08.610> following<00:01:09.060> that<00:01:09.240> I<00:01:09.540> doesn't<00:01:10.049> look

00:01:10.310 --> 00:01:10.320 
that is following that I doesn't look

00:01:10.320 --> 00:01:12.770 
that is following that I doesn't look
like<00:01:10.530> she<00:01:10.710> has<00:01:10.799> a<00:01:10.830> flare<00:01:11.310> in<00:01:11.520> her<00:01:11.640> hand

00:01:12.770 --> 00:01:12.780 
like she has a flare in her hand

00:01:12.780 --> 00:01:15.710 
like she has a flare in her hand
there's<00:01:13.080> no<00:01:13.260> red<00:01:14.010> red<00:01:14.460> light<00:01:14.760> that<00:01:15.180> has<00:01:15.509> been

00:01:15.710 --> 00:01:15.720 
there's no red red light that has been

00:01:15.720 --> 00:01:18.109 
there's no red red light that has been
illuminated<00:01:16.560> like<00:01:16.740> that<00:01:16.950> but<00:01:17.670> at<00:01:17.820> the<00:01:17.909> same

00:01:18.109 --> 00:01:18.119 
illuminated like that but at the same

00:01:18.119 --> 00:01:19.820 
illuminated like that but at the same
time<00:01:18.420> that's<00:01:18.720> something<00:01:18.960> that<00:01:19.350> can<00:01:19.530> be<00:01:19.650> added

00:01:19.820 --> 00:01:19.830 
time that's something that can be added

00:01:19.830 --> 00:01:21.740 
time that's something that can be added
in<00:01:20.070> post-production<00:01:20.549> it's<00:01:21.210> something<00:01:21.570> that

00:01:21.740 --> 00:01:21.750 
in post-production it's something that

00:01:21.750 --> 00:01:24.590 
in post-production it's something that
could<00:01:21.900> be<00:01:22.640> changed<00:01:23.640> they<00:01:23.850> can<00:01:24.030> actually<00:01:24.390> make

00:01:24.590 --> 00:01:24.600 
could be changed they can actually make

00:01:24.600 --> 00:01:27.710 
could be changed they can actually make
it<00:01:24.630> so<00:01:25.220> the<00:01:26.220> flare<00:01:26.580> light<00:01:26.880> is<00:01:27.119> showing<00:01:27.479> up<00:01:27.600> on

00:01:27.710 --> 00:01:27.720 
it so the flare light is showing up on

00:01:27.720 --> 00:01:29.929 
it so the flare light is showing up on
the<00:01:27.869> ground<00:01:28.080> but<00:01:28.409> I<00:01:28.560> just<00:01:28.770> I<00:01:28.920> like<00:01:29.220> the<00:01:29.400> shot<00:01:29.670> of

00:01:29.929 --> 00:01:29.939 
the ground but I just I like the shot of

00:01:29.939 --> 00:01:34.130 
the ground but I just I like the shot of
the<00:01:30.180> Queen<00:01:30.479> exiting<00:01:31.140> her<00:01:31.350> kingdom<00:01:32.750> to<00:01:33.750> go<00:01:33.960> out

00:01:34.130 --> 00:01:34.140 
the Queen exiting her kingdom to go out

00:01:34.140 --> 00:01:37.039 
the Queen exiting her kingdom to go out
and<00:01:34.350> maybe<00:01:34.500> face<00:01:34.860> the<00:01:35.100> indominus<00:01:35.400> rex<00:01:35.840> we<00:01:36.840> do

00:01:37.039 --> 00:01:37.049 
and maybe face the indominus rex we do

00:01:37.049 --> 00:01:38.660 
and maybe face the indominus rex we do
know<00:01:37.290> that<00:01:37.320> it<00:01:37.680> steps<00:01:37.979> out<00:01:38.189> and<00:01:38.400> Claire

00:01:38.660 --> 00:01:38.670 
know that it steps out and Claire

00:01:38.670 --> 00:01:41.450 
know that it steps out and Claire
already<00:01:39.060> has<00:01:39.240> a<00:01:39.270> running<00:01:39.810> start<00:01:40.110> so<00:01:40.920> I<00:01:41.310> think

00:01:41.450 --> 00:01:41.460 
already has a running start so I think

00:01:41.460 --> 00:01:45.740 
already has a running start so I think
that<00:01:41.850> the<00:01:41.970> t-rex<00:01:42.360> will<00:01:43.369> could<00:01:44.369> possibly<00:01:45.030> still

00:01:45.740 --> 00:01:45.750 
that the t-rex will could possibly still

00:01:45.750 --> 00:01:47.719 
that the t-rex will could possibly still
catch<00:01:46.020> her<00:01:46.290> although<00:01:47.070> I<00:01:47.100> don't<00:01:47.399> think<00:01:47.610> that

00:01:47.719 --> 00:01:47.729 
catch her although I don't think that

00:01:47.729 --> 00:01:50.899 
catch her although I don't think that
that's<00:01:47.850> likely<00:01:48.470> t-rex<00:01:49.470> does<00:01:49.860> while<00:01:50.520> she's

00:01:50.899 --> 00:01:50.909 
that's likely t-rex does while she's

00:01:50.909 --> 00:01:52.910 
that's likely t-rex does while she's
able<00:01:51.210> to<00:01:51.299> run<00:01:51.479> very<00:01:51.720> very<00:01:51.810> fast<00:01:52.290> it<00:01:52.560> does<00:01:52.710> take

00:01:52.910 --> 00:01:52.920 
able to run very very fast it does take

00:01:52.920 --> 00:01:55.130 
able to run very very fast it does take
her<00:01:53.040> a<00:01:53.070> little<00:01:53.189> bit<00:01:53.399> of<00:01:53.520> time<00:01:53.790> to<00:01:54.659> build<00:01:54.840> up

00:01:55.130 --> 00:01:55.140 
her a little bit of time to build up

00:01:55.140 --> 00:01:57.679 
her a little bit of time to build up
that<00:01:55.409> speed<00:01:55.860> we<00:01:56.250> saw<00:01:56.490> her<00:01:56.670> actually<00:01:56.909> come

00:01:57.679 --> 00:01:57.689 
that speed we saw her actually come

00:01:57.689 --> 00:02:00.469 
that speed we saw her actually come
after<00:01:58.110> the<00:01:58.860> Jeep<00:01:59.280> in<00:01:59.520> the<00:01:59.640> first<00:01:59.880> movie<00:02:00.210> but<00:02:00.240> it

00:02:00.469 --> 00:02:00.479 
after the Jeep in the first movie but it

00:02:00.479 --> 00:02:02.300 
after the Jeep in the first movie but it
did<00:02:00.659> take<00:02:00.869> her<00:02:01.049> a<00:02:01.079> while<00:02:01.170> to<00:02:01.710> build<00:02:01.860> up<00:02:02.070> that

00:02:02.300 --> 00:02:02.310 
did take her a while to build up that

00:02:02.310 --> 00:02:04.969 
did take her a while to build up that
speed<00:02:02.579> to<00:02:02.640> where<00:02:02.969> she<00:02:03.180> was<00:02:03.299> able<00:02:03.450> to<00:02:03.799> get<00:02:04.799> right

00:02:04.969 --> 00:02:04.979 
speed to where she was able to get right

00:02:04.979 --> 00:02:06.649 
speed to where she was able to get right
next<00:02:05.310> to<00:02:05.399> it<00:02:05.520> so<00:02:06.149> that's<00:02:06.270> really<00:02:06.390> interesting

00:02:06.649 --> 00:02:06.659 
next to it so that's really interesting

00:02:06.659 --> 00:02:08.839 
next to it so that's really interesting
I<00:02:07.140> don't<00:02:07.350> see<00:02:07.530> the<00:02:07.680> fate<00:02:07.890> of<00:02:07.920> Claire<00:02:08.640> being

00:02:08.839 --> 00:02:08.849 
I don't see the fate of Claire being

00:02:08.849 --> 00:02:10.669 
I don't see the fate of Claire being
that<00:02:09.119> she's<00:02:09.300> eaten<00:02:09.629> by<00:02:09.780> the<00:02:09.840> t-rex<00:02:10.259> in<00:02:10.530> this

00:02:10.669 --> 00:02:10.679 
that she's eaten by the t-rex in this

00:02:10.679 --> 00:02:13.730 
that she's eaten by the t-rex in this
sequence<00:02:11.629> later<00:02:12.629> on<00:02:12.870> we<00:02:13.080> see<00:02:13.319> her<00:02:13.470> leg

00:02:13.730 --> 00:02:13.740 
sequence later on we see her leg

00:02:13.740 --> 00:02:15.410 
sequence later on we see her leg
on<00:02:13.890> the<00:02:14.010> ground<00:02:14.280> and<00:02:14.520> she's<00:02:14.760> looking<00:02:15.120> up<00:02:15.240> at

00:02:15.410 --> 00:02:15.420 
on the ground and she's looking up at

00:02:15.420 --> 00:02:17.810 
on the ground and she's looking up at
something<00:02:15.660> I<00:02:16.050> think<00:02:16.500> that<00:02:16.770> that<00:02:17.160> that<00:02:17.520> shot

00:02:17.810 --> 00:02:17.820 
something I think that that that shot

00:02:17.820 --> 00:02:19.400 
something I think that that that shot
takes<00:02:18.120> place<00:02:18.330> after<00:02:18.600> the<00:02:18.900> shot<00:02:19.110> where<00:02:19.320> the

00:02:19.400 --> 00:02:19.410 
takes place after the shot where the

00:02:19.410 --> 00:02:22.940 
takes place after the shot where the
t-rex<00:02:19.680> has<00:02:20.220> now<00:02:20.550> stepped<00:02:20.970> out<00:02:21.270> and<00:02:21.660> is<00:02:22.410> chasing

00:02:22.940 --> 00:02:22.950 
t-rex has now stepped out and is chasing

00:02:22.950 --> 00:02:26.840 
t-rex has now stepped out and is chasing
after<00:02:23.250> Claire<00:02:23.850> and<00:02:24.110> the<00:02:25.110> t-rex<00:02:25.530> it<00:02:25.950> just<00:02:26.280> it's

00:02:26.840 --> 00:02:26.850 
after Claire and the t-rex it just it's

00:02:26.850 --> 00:02:28.790 
after Claire and the t-rex it just it's
just<00:02:27.150> an<00:02:27.270> awesome<00:02:27.420> shot<00:02:27.900> to<00:02:28.170> see<00:02:28.380> Claire

00:02:28.790 --> 00:02:28.800 
just an awesome shot to see Claire

00:02:28.800 --> 00:02:30.890 
just an awesome shot to see Claire
already<00:02:29.220> running<00:02:29.550> she<00:02:30.300> knows<00:02:30.540> what's<00:02:30.840> coming

00:02:30.890 --> 00:02:30.900 
already running she knows what's coming

00:02:30.900 --> 00:02:33.470 
already running she knows what's coming
I<00:02:31.440> think<00:02:32.340> it's<00:02:32.490> an<00:02:32.640> awesome<00:02:32.760> shot<00:02:33.180> for<00:02:33.390> the

00:02:33.470 --> 00:02:33.480 
I think it's an awesome shot for the

00:02:33.480 --> 00:02:35.990 
I think it's an awesome shot for the
audience<00:02:33.870> because<00:02:34.250> possibly<00:02:35.250> in<00:02:35.400> the<00:02:35.520> film<00:02:35.760> if

00:02:35.990 --> 00:02:36.000 
audience because possibly in the film if

00:02:36.000 --> 00:02:38.630 
audience because possibly in the film if
we<00:02:36.150> haven't<00:02:36.480> seen<00:02:36.690> Rex's<00:02:37.410> big<00:02:37.740> full<00:02:38.070> body<00:02:38.340> shot

00:02:38.630 --> 00:02:38.640 
we haven't seen Rex's big full body shot

00:02:38.640 --> 00:02:41.240 
we haven't seen Rex's big full body shot
debut<00:02:39.150> yet<00:02:39.420> this<00:02:40.110> would<00:02:40.380> be<00:02:40.500> really<00:02:40.710> cool<00:02:41.010> to

00:02:41.240 --> 00:02:41.250 
debut yet this would be really cool to

00:02:41.250 --> 00:02:43.970 
debut yet this would be really cool to
just<00:02:41.280> kind<00:02:41.640> of<00:02:41.730> see<00:02:41.940> her<00:02:42.150> teeth<00:02:42.450> not<00:02:43.440> excuse<00:02:43.830> me

00:02:43.970 --> 00:02:43.980 
just kind of see her teeth not excuse me

00:02:43.980 --> 00:02:46.700 
just kind of see her teeth not excuse me
not<00:02:44.220> her<00:02:44.340> teeth<00:02:44.550> her<00:02:44.730> feet<00:02:45.060> and<00:02:45.300> then<00:02:46.020> maybe<00:02:46.440> as

00:02:46.700 --> 00:02:46.710 
not her teeth her feet and then maybe as

00:02:46.710 --> 00:02:49.280 
not her teeth her feet and then maybe as
the<00:02:46.890> indominus<00:02:47.190> rex<00:02:47.520> approaches<00:02:48.390> it<00:02:48.870> kind<00:02:49.200> of

00:02:49.280 --> 00:02:49.290 
the indominus rex approaches it kind of

00:02:49.290 --> 00:02:52.400 
the indominus rex approaches it kind of
pans<00:02:49.620> up<00:02:49.920> and<00:02:50.070> we<00:02:50.310> see<00:02:50.580> Rexy<00:02:51.150> similar<00:02:52.050> to<00:02:52.260> kind

00:02:52.400 --> 00:02:52.410 
pans up and we see Rexy similar to kind

00:02:52.410 --> 00:02:55.040 
pans up and we see Rexy similar to kind
of<00:02:52.530> Godzilla<00:02:53.010> but<00:02:53.310> our<00:02:53.820> Godzilla's<00:02:54.510> reveal<00:02:54.810> in

00:02:55.040 --> 00:02:55.050 
of Godzilla but our Godzilla's reveal in

00:02:55.050 --> 00:02:57.920 
of Godzilla but our Godzilla's reveal in
2014<00:02:55.710> but<00:02:56.550> possibly<00:02:57.300> a<00:02:57.360> little<00:02:57.480> bit<00:02:57.630> more

00:02:57.920 --> 00:02:57.930 
2014 but possibly a little bit more

00:02:57.930 --> 00:03:00.230 
2014 but possibly a little bit more
fast-paced<00:02:58.560> as<00:02:58.770> how<00:02:58.890> I<00:02:58.920> would<00:02:59.220> like<00:02:59.370> it<00:02:59.610> maybe

00:03:00.230 --> 00:03:00.240 
fast-paced as how I would like it maybe

00:03:00.240 --> 00:03:02.330 
fast-paced as how I would like it maybe
just<00:03:00.540> pan<00:03:00.780> up<00:03:00.990> on<00:03:01.170> her<00:03:01.320> and<00:03:01.470> our<00:03:01.620> first<00:03:01.920> shot<00:03:02.190> of

00:03:02.330 --> 00:03:02.340 
just pan up on her and our first shot of

00:03:02.340 --> 00:03:04.190 
just pan up on her and our first shot of
her<00:03:02.520> would<00:03:03.240> just<00:03:03.450> be<00:03:03.630> her

00:03:04.190 --> 00:03:04.200 
her would just be her

00:03:04.200 --> 00:03:06.350 
her would just be her
roaring<00:03:04.860> similar<00:03:05.370> to<00:03:05.520> like<00:03:05.700> Godzilla<00:03:06.180> did

00:03:06.350 --> 00:03:06.360 
roaring similar to like Godzilla did

00:03:06.360 --> 00:03:08.000 
roaring similar to like Godzilla did
only<00:03:06.570> she'll<00:03:06.960> be<00:03:07.080> roaring<00:03:07.350> at<00:03:07.590> the<00:03:07.740> indominus

00:03:08.000 --> 00:03:08.010 
only she'll be roaring at the indominus

00:03:08.010 --> 00:03:10.430 
only she'll be roaring at the indominus
rex<00:03:08.310> I<00:03:08.730> think<00:03:09.390> that<00:03:09.720> would<00:03:09.900> be<00:03:09.930> really<00:03:10.410> really

00:03:10.430 --> 00:03:10.440 
rex I think that would be really really

00:03:10.440 --> 00:03:13.040 
rex I think that would be really really
cool<00:03:10.710> so<00:03:11.580> yes<00:03:11.850> I<00:03:12.060> definitely<00:03:12.240> think<00:03:12.510> that<00:03:12.750> the

00:03:13.040 --> 00:03:13.050 
cool so yes I definitely think that the

00:03:13.050 --> 00:03:15.410 
cool so yes I definitely think that the
large<00:03:13.560> theropod<00:03:14.160> chasing<00:03:14.700> Claire<00:03:14.940> is<00:03:15.180> now<00:03:15.390> a

00:03:15.410 --> 00:03:15.420 
large theropod chasing Claire is now a

00:03:15.420 --> 00:03:18.110 
large theropod chasing Claire is now a
t-rex<00:03:15.930> and<00:03:16.170> this<00:03:16.770> is<00:03:16.980> the<00:03:17.250> precursor<00:03:17.700> to<00:03:17.910> the

00:03:18.110 --> 00:03:18.120 
t-rex and this is the precursor to the

00:03:18.120 --> 00:03:21.260 
t-rex and this is the precursor to the
big<00:03:18.540> final<00:03:18.930> battle<00:03:19.440> that<00:03:19.620> Colin<00:03:20.550> himself<00:03:21.090> has

00:03:21.260 --> 00:03:21.270 
big final battle that Colin himself has

00:03:21.270 --> 00:03:24.950 
big final battle that Colin himself has
said<00:03:21.570> will<00:03:22.140> be<00:03:22.320> nuts<00:03:22.650> I<00:03:23.010> cannot<00:03:23.970> wait<00:03:24.480> to<00:03:24.750> see

00:03:24.950 --> 00:03:24.960 
said will be nuts I cannot wait to see

00:03:24.960 --> 00:03:26.510 
said will be nuts I cannot wait to see
it<00:03:24.990> it's<00:03:25.260> going<00:03:25.440> to<00:03:25.560> be<00:03:25.740> spectacular

00:03:26.510 --> 00:03:26.520 
it it's going to be spectacular

00:03:26.520 --> 00:03:28.250
