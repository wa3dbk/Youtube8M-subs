00:00:03.020 --> 00:00:08.450
 in this class we will learn to develop 

00:00:06.260 --> 00:00:12.740
 crowds from the tool 

00:00:08.450 --> 00:00:16.430
 popularly with it it is possible to create 

00:00:12.740 --> 00:00:20.180
 crowds stop in motion 

00:00:16.430 --> 00:00:23.420
 let's go to class the tool popup and 

00:00:20.180 --> 00:00:27.920
 finds on the network bank that is one and the ae 

00:00:23.420 --> 00:00:31.490
 user interface if it does not 

00:00:27.920 --> 00:00:33.490
 available we can enable 

00:00:31.490 --> 00:00:38.520
 I sing more 

00:00:33.490 --> 00:00:38.520
 show ii rival 

00:00:40.430 --> 00:00:48.000
 as shown the rival is by 

00:00:44.400 --> 00:00:51.570
 pattern below also air on his last 

00:00:48.000 --> 00:00:54.630
 option is the popular one and clicking muhsen 

00:00:51.570 --> 00:00:56.500
 and its construction options are 

00:00:54.630 --> 00:00:59.800
 displayed 

00:00:56.500 --> 00:01:01.560
 Double-clicking opens all the 

00:00:59.800 --> 00:01:04.110
 menus 

00:01:01.560 --> 00:01:06.930
 the way the boy stays open in this 

00:01:04.110 --> 00:01:08.550
 last option will be the one used during 

00:01:06.930 --> 00:01:11.010
 all course 

00:01:08.550 --> 00:01:13.650
 so we can use double click 

00:01:11.010 --> 00:01:18.390
 to leave open 

00:01:13.650 --> 00:01:21.780
 among them - we have the defy flosi that serves 

00:01:18.390 --> 00:01:25.200
 for creating flows of people 

00:01:21.780 --> 00:01:28.890
 here we have the fillon creator who creates the 

00:01:25.200 --> 00:01:31.950
 flow and with the selected flow we can 

00:01:28.890 --> 00:01:34.890
 reissue segments with edson spoke 

00:01:31.950 --> 00:01:38.430
 we can also create new segments with 

00:01:34.890 --> 00:01:41.080
 edson spoke and create elevations in the flow 

00:01:38.430 --> 00:01:44.320
 or cleide ram 

00:01:41.080 --> 00:01:47.110
 above we have available to change the 

00:01:44.320 --> 00:01:49.600
 flow creation brush width 

00:01:47.110 --> 00:01:52.450
 through age 

00:01:49.600 --> 00:01:56.050
 let's use the cracker to create 

00:01:52.450 --> 00:01:59.290
 a flow for this click according to 

00:01:56.050 --> 00:02:02.080
 displayed and see that with each click on a 

00:01:59.290 --> 00:02:05.290
 new thread is created 

00:02:02.080 --> 00:02:08.679
 the arrows displayed in the stream show the 

00:02:05.290 --> 00:02:12.099
 people to be created 

00:02:08.679 --> 00:02:15.129
 the pink arrow indicates female gender 

00:02:12.099 --> 00:02:18.579
 the blue arrow indicates male 

00:02:15.129 --> 00:02:21.420
 the arrows also indicate the direction the 

00:02:18.579 --> 00:02:24.670
 person will be pointed 

00:02:21.420 --> 00:02:27.489
 note however that if we create an angle 

00:02:24.670 --> 00:02:30.129
 very closed in a new segment 

00:02:27.489 --> 00:02:32.950
 internal flow lines are no longer 

00:02:30.129 --> 00:02:34.689
 are displayed and the angle lines are 

00:02:32.950 --> 00:02:37.599
 yellow 

00:02:34.689 --> 00:02:41.950
 this occurs whenever the tool does not 

00:02:37.599 --> 00:02:44.439
 can create the flow in this case 

00:02:41.950 --> 00:02:46.450
 we must change the angle so that the 

00:02:44.439 --> 00:02:49.169
 software can deploy 

00:02:46.450 --> 00:02:49.169
 correctly 

00:02:49.190 --> 00:02:56.870
 with the created flow we changed one of the 

00:02:52.700 --> 00:02:59.270
 segments with at fol note that the 

00:02:56.870 --> 00:03:00.770
 hover over a line 

00:02:59.270 --> 00:03:03.860
 or segment 

00:03:00.770 --> 00:03:06.950
 they change color or we can 

00:03:03.860 --> 00:03:10.100
 select one or the other to 

00:03:06.950 --> 00:03:13.190
 we will select one 

00:03:10.100 --> 00:03:16.770
 with the select tool in 

00:03:13.190 --> 00:03:19.960
 the move changed its position 

00:03:16.770 --> 00:03:23.440
 now with the option is garbage flow 

00:03:19.960 --> 00:03:26.560
 let's create new segments 

00:03:23.440 --> 00:03:29.140
 by hovering over a stream 

00:03:26.560 --> 00:03:30.760
 green line indicates the possibility of 

00:03:29.140 --> 00:03:34.330
 create a segment 

00:03:30.760 --> 00:03:35.819
 if it is orange, it will not be possible to create 

00:03:34.330 --> 00:03:38.549
 it 

00:03:35.819 --> 00:03:42.200
 this occurs when we try to create a 

00:03:38.549 --> 00:03:45.829
 new segment next to an existing one 

00:03:42.200 --> 00:03:49.680
 besides creating segments within the flow 

00:03:45.829 --> 00:03:52.469
 we can add more parts to the flow 

00:03:49.680 --> 00:03:56.670
 clicking at the beginning or end of the stream 

00:03:52.469 --> 00:03:58.170
 created a green square is displayed in the 

00:03:56.670 --> 00:04:00.659
 flow point 

00:03:58.170 --> 00:04:04.310
 with this we can create a new stage 

00:04:00.659 --> 00:04:04.310
 for he observes 

00:04:05.680 --> 00:04:13.480
 the hide ramis option will be worked more 

00:04:09.189 --> 00:04:16.150
 Later in the course in this class we 

00:04:13.480 --> 00:04:19.769
 location of the popular tool and 

00:04:16.150 --> 00:04:19.769
 how to create streams of people 

00:04:19.910 --> 00:04:26.060
 In the next class we will learn to 

00:04:22.760 --> 00:04:28.970
 develop from your stops and sitting 

00:04:26.060 --> 00:04:31.330
 then start testing the ways 

00:04:28.970 --> 00:04:31.330
 exhibition
