um along with me one of the top players
in<00:00:16.500> the<00:00:16.859> foreign<00:00:17.250> seen<00:00:17.490> here<00:00:17.730> as<00:00:18.330> I<00:00:18.480> do<00:00:18.539> right

00:00:18.650 --> 00:00:18.660 
in the foreign seen here as I do right

00:00:18.660 --> 00:00:20.810 
in the foreign seen here as I do right
now<00:00:18.930> you<00:00:18.990> can<00:00:19.199> definitely<00:00:19.830> and<00:00:20.279> you<00:00:20.490> guys<00:00:20.640> are

00:00:20.810 --> 00:00:20.820 
now you can definitely and you guys are

now you can definitely and you guys are
definitely<00:00:20.880> enjoying<00:00:21.390> the<00:00:21.680> the<00:00:22.680> fact<00:00:22.890> that<00:00:22.980> we

00:00:23.179 --> 00:00:23.189 
definitely enjoying the the fact that we

00:00:23.189 --> 00:00:26.120 
definitely enjoying the the fact that we
can<00:00:23.340> hear<00:00:23.670> exactly<00:00:23.850> what<00:00:24.480> a<00:00:24.840> top<00:00:25.529> gamer<00:00:25.859> would

00:00:26.120 --> 00:00:26.130 
can hear exactly what a top gamer would

00:00:26.130 --> 00:00:28.400 
can hear exactly what a top gamer would
do<00:00:26.369> in<00:00:26.580> these<00:00:26.670> situations<00:00:26.849> and<00:00:27.480> so<00:00:28.170> that<00:00:28.320> is

00:00:28.400 --> 00:00:28.410 
do in these situations and so that is

00:00:28.410 --> 00:00:30.019 
do in these situations and so that is
really<00:00:28.439> cool<00:00:28.680> but<00:00:29.490> anyway<00:00:29.699> we're<00:00:29.820> going<00:00:29.939> to

00:00:30.019 --> 00:00:30.029 
really cool but anyway we're going to

00:00:30.029 --> 00:00:31.849 
really cool but anyway we're going to
see<00:00:30.150> the<00:00:30.300> probably<00:00:31.080> scanners<00:00:31.410> go<00:00:31.560> up<00:00:31.679> there

00:00:31.849 --> 00:00:31.859 
see the probably scanners go up there

00:00:31.859 --> 00:00:33.340 
see the probably scanners go up there
yeah<00:00:32.040> there's<00:00:32.219> a<00:00:32.279> COMSAT<00:00:32.610> station<00:00:32.940> for<00:00:33.090> flash

00:00:33.340 --> 00:00:33.350 
yeah there's a COMSAT station for flash

00:00:33.350 --> 00:00:35.420 
yeah there's a COMSAT station for flash
flash<00:00:34.350> looks<00:00:34.590> like<00:00:34.710> he's<00:00:34.829> content<00:00:35.190> to<00:00:35.219> sit

00:00:35.420 --> 00:00:35.430 
flash looks like he's content to sit

00:00:35.430 --> 00:00:37.250 
flash looks like he's content to sit
back<00:00:35.579> might<00:00:36.450> be<00:00:36.570> building<00:00:36.809> up<00:00:36.870> a<00:00:36.960> couple<00:00:37.140> of

00:00:37.250 --> 00:00:37.260 
back might be building up a couple of

00:00:37.260 --> 00:00:38.330 
back might be building up a couple of
vultures<00:00:37.350> though<00:00:37.710> maybe<00:00:37.890> we'll<00:00:38.070> see<00:00:38.190> a<00:00:38.219> little

00:00:38.330 --> 00:00:38.340 
vultures though maybe we'll see a little

00:00:38.340 --> 00:00:40.729 
vultures though maybe we'll see a little
bit<00:00:38.489> of<00:00:38.550> nada<00:00:39.480> stout<00:00:39.870> vulture<00:00:40.290> harass<00:00:40.559> or

00:00:40.729 --> 00:00:40.739 
bit of nada stout vulture harass or

00:00:40.739 --> 00:00:41.780 
bit of nada stout vulture harass or
maybe<00:00:40.890> he's<00:00:41.070> just<00:00:41.160> going<00:00:41.309> to<00:00:41.370> be<00:00:41.460> content<00:00:41.760> to

00:00:41.780 --> 00:00:41.790 
maybe he's just going to be content to

00:00:41.790 --> 00:00:43.819 
maybe he's just going to be content to
sit<00:00:42.059> and<00:00:42.210> build<00:00:42.960> up<00:00:42.989> tanks<00:00:43.350> will<00:00:43.469> have<00:00:43.559> to<00:00:43.649> see

00:00:43.819 --> 00:00:43.829 
sit and build up tanks will have to see

00:00:43.829 --> 00:00:45.650 
sit and build up tanks will have to see
most<00:00:44.489> likely<00:00:44.579> he<00:00:44.879> will<00:00:45.000> we<00:00:45.120> did<00:00:45.270> see<00:00:45.480> him

00:00:45.650 --> 00:00:45.660 
most likely he will we did see him

00:00:45.660 --> 00:00:47.420 
most likely he will we did see him
getting<00:00:45.870> through<00:00:46.230> we<00:00:46.770> did<00:00:46.920> see<00:00:47.129> him<00:00:47.219> Maya

00:00:47.420 --> 00:00:47.430 
getting through we did see him Maya

00:00:47.430 --> 00:00:50.420 
getting through we did see him Maya
through<00:00:47.789> that<00:00:48.000> mineral<00:00:48.840> block<00:00:49.430> possibly

00:00:50.420 --> 00:00:50.430 
through that mineral block possibly

00:00:50.430 --> 00:00:52.910 
through that mineral block possibly
looking<00:00:51.270> to<00:00:51.420> quickly<00:00:51.780> expand<00:00:52.260> some<00:00:52.469> more<00:00:52.710> I

00:00:52.910 --> 00:00:52.920 
looking to quickly expand some more I

00:00:52.920 --> 00:00:54.590 
looking to quickly expand some more I
really<00:00:53.399> think<00:00:53.520> this<00:00:53.670> this<00:00:54.030> looks<00:00:54.180> like<00:00:54.329> a<00:00:54.390> very

00:00:54.590 --> 00:00:54.600 
really think this this looks like a very

00:00:54.600 --> 00:00:58.430 
really think this this looks like a very
strong<00:00:55.050> map<00:00:55.350> for<00:00:56.039> a<00:00:56.340> Terran<00:00:56.879> player<00:00:57.000> to<00:00:57.449> play<00:00:58.410> a

00:00:58.430 --> 00:00:58.440 
strong map for a Terran player to play a

00:00:58.440 --> 00:01:01.819 
strong map for a Terran player to play a
really<00:00:58.620> greedy<00:00:59.070> greedy<00:00:59.969> build<00:01:00.390> and<00:01:00.719> just<00:01:01.020> make

00:01:01.819 --> 00:01:01.829 
really greedy greedy build and just make

00:01:01.829 --> 00:01:04.759 
really greedy greedy build and just make
a<00:01:02.039> ton<00:01:02.489> of<00:01:02.520> units<00:01:03.030> because<00:01:03.989> there<00:01:04.170> are<00:01:04.229> so<00:01:04.290> many

00:01:04.759 --> 00:01:04.769 
a ton of units because there are so many

00:01:04.769 --> 00:01:06.770 
a ton of units because there are so many
positions<00:01:05.129> on<00:01:05.400> the<00:01:05.489> map<00:01:05.670> that<00:01:05.909> once<00:01:06.450> Terran

00:01:06.770 --> 00:01:06.780 
positions on the map that once Terran

00:01:06.780 --> 00:01:08.450 
positions on the map that once Terran
gets<00:01:06.990> there<00:01:07.260> it's<00:01:08.010> going<00:01:08.189> to<00:01:08.250> take<00:01:08.430> some

00:01:08.450 --> 00:01:08.460 
gets there it's going to take some

00:01:08.460 --> 00:01:10.730 
gets there it's going to take some
special<00:01:09.060> magic<00:01:09.420> to<00:01:09.540> get<00:01:09.659> them<00:01:09.780> out<00:01:09.869> the<00:01:10.350> ramps

00:01:10.730 --> 00:01:10.740 
special magic to get them out the ramps

00:01:10.740 --> 00:01:13.190 
special magic to get them out the ramps
in<00:01:10.830> the<00:01:10.920> middle<00:01:11.510> their<00:01:12.510> eyes<00:01:12.689> you<00:01:12.960> know<00:01:13.080> the

00:01:13.190 --> 00:01:13.200 
in the middle their eyes you know the

00:01:13.200 --> 00:01:14.780 
in the middle their eyes you know the
narrow<00:01:13.619> chokes<00:01:13.950> in<00:01:14.100> the<00:01:14.189> middle<00:01:14.400> rather<00:01:14.549> the

00:01:14.780 --> 00:01:14.790 
narrow chokes in the middle rather the

00:01:14.790 --> 00:01:17.030 
narrow chokes in the middle rather the
little<00:01:14.970> bridges<00:01:15.360> and<00:01:15.630> then<00:01:15.750> all<00:01:16.020> that<00:01:16.200> the

00:01:17.030 --> 00:01:17.040 
little bridges and then all that the

00:01:17.040 --> 00:01:19.280 
little bridges and then all that the
Rams<00:01:17.310> going<00:01:17.850> into<00:01:18.150> the<00:01:18.420> bases<00:01:18.810> on<00:01:18.930> the<00:01:19.020> sides

00:01:19.280 --> 00:01:19.290 
Rams going into the bases on the sides

00:01:19.290 --> 00:01:21.260 
Rams going into the bases on the sides
you<00:01:20.040> know<00:01:20.070> all<00:01:20.310> the<00:01:20.460> chokes<00:01:20.700> on<00:01:20.850> the<00:01:20.939> map<00:01:21.090> are

00:01:21.260 --> 00:01:21.270 
you know all the chokes on the map are

00:01:21.270 --> 00:01:23.390 
you know all the chokes on the map are
really<00:01:21.509> narrow<00:01:21.810> and<00:01:22.140> that<00:01:22.740> just<00:01:22.979> favors

00:01:23.390 --> 00:01:23.400 
really narrow and that just favors

00:01:23.400 --> 00:01:25.179 
really narrow and that just favors
Terran<00:01:23.790> in<00:01:23.909> a<00:01:24.000> in<00:01:24.299> a<00:01:24.390> really<00:01:24.810> big<00:01:24.960> way

00:01:25.179 --> 00:01:25.189 
Terran in a in a really big way

00:01:25.189 --> 00:01:27.560 
Terran in a in a really big way
especially<00:01:26.189> once<00:01:26.400> they<00:01:26.610> start<00:01:27.240> to<00:01:27.299> build<00:01:27.420> up

00:01:27.560 --> 00:01:27.570 
especially once they start to build up

00:01:27.570 --> 00:01:30.679 
especially once they start to build up
that<00:01:27.630> critical<00:01:28.229> mass<00:01:28.409> of<00:01:28.439> Tanks<00:01:29.100> that<00:01:29.850> that<00:01:30.570> we

00:01:30.679 --> 00:01:30.689 
that critical mass of Tanks that that we

00:01:30.689 --> 00:01:32.860 
that critical mass of Tanks that that we
know<00:01:30.840> flash<00:01:31.170> will<00:01:31.500> get

00:01:32.860 --> 00:01:32.870 
know flash will get

00:01:32.870 --> 00:01:35.590 
know flash will get
yeah<00:01:33.500> looks<00:01:33.920> like<00:01:33.980> flashes<00:01:34.430> attempt<00:01:34.700> to<00:01:34.880> do

00:01:35.590 --> 00:01:35.600 
yeah looks like flashes attempt to do

00:01:35.600 --> 00:01:36.880 
yeah looks like flashes attempt to do
some<00:01:35.690> her<00:01:35.840> ass<00:01:35.960> with<00:01:36.110> those<00:01:36.200> vultures<00:01:36.440> failed

00:01:36.880 --> 00:01:36.890 
some her ass with those vultures failed

00:01:36.890 --> 00:01:39.280 
some her ass with those vultures failed
although<00:01:37.130> he<00:01:37.390> did<00:01:38.390> have<00:01:38.420> some<00:01:38.630> decent<00:01:38.930> micro

00:01:39.280 --> 00:01:39.290 
although he did have some decent micro

00:01:39.290 --> 00:01:40.660 
although he did have some decent micro
um<00:01:39.530> he<00:01:39.800> didn't<00:01:40.040> he<00:01:40.190> probably<00:01:40.370> didn't<00:01:40.640> even

00:01:40.660 --> 00:01:40.670 
um he didn't he probably didn't even

00:01:40.670 --> 00:01:42.640 
um he didn't he probably didn't even
know<00:01:40.880> there<00:01:41.030> was<00:01:41.150> a<00:01:41.210> three<00:01:41.960> pylons<00:01:42.380> there<00:01:42.530> so

00:01:42.640 --> 00:01:42.650 
know there was a three pylons there so

00:01:42.650 --> 00:01:44.200 
know there was a three pylons there so
even<00:01:42.800> if<00:01:42.860> he<00:01:42.920> killed<00:01:43.100> off<00:01:43.220> those<00:01:43.370> goons<00:01:43.580> he

00:01:44.200 --> 00:01:44.210 
even if he killed off those goons he

00:01:44.210 --> 00:01:45.430 
even if he killed off those goons he
would<00:01:44.330> have<00:01:44.450> gotten<00:01:44.630> into<00:01:44.900> the<00:01:44.990> second<00:01:45.290> base

00:01:45.430 --> 00:01:45.440 
would have gotten into the second base

00:01:45.440 --> 00:01:47.080 
would have gotten into the second base
but<00:01:46.250> you<00:01:46.370> know<00:01:46.460> that<00:01:46.580> didn't<00:01:46.730> really<00:01:46.910> cost

00:01:47.080 --> 00:01:47.090 
but you know that didn't really cost

00:01:47.090 --> 00:01:49.720 
but you know that didn't really cost
flash<00:01:47.360> much<00:01:47.600> I'm<00:01:47.980> flash<00:01:48.980> now<00:01:49.160> putting<00:01:49.520> down<00:01:49.700> a

00:01:49.720 --> 00:01:49.730 
flash much I'm flash now putting down a

00:01:49.730 --> 00:01:51.040 
flash much I'm flash now putting down a
lot<00:01:49.970> of<00:01:50.000> factories<00:01:50.360> and<00:01:50.570> he's<00:01:50.690> probably<00:01:50.870> at

00:01:51.040 --> 00:01:51.050 
lot of factories and he's probably at

00:01:51.050 --> 00:01:53.860 
lot of factories and he's probably at
five<00:01:51.230> right<00:01:52.010> now<00:01:52.070> and<00:01:52.400> just<00:01:53.120> continue<00:01:53.510> a<00:01:53.540> macro

00:01:53.860 --> 00:01:53.870 
five right now and just continue a macro

00:01:53.870 --> 00:01:55.300 
five right now and just continue a macro
up<00:01:53.990> inside<00:01:54.230> of<00:01:54.290> space<00:01:54.500> he's<00:01:54.980> going<00:01:55.100> to<00:01:55.190> push

00:01:55.300 --> 00:01:55.310 
up inside of space he's going to push

00:01:55.310 --> 00:01:56.740 
up inside of space he's going to push
out<00:01:55.430> a<00:01:55.460> little<00:01:55.640> bit<00:01:55.790> maybe<00:01:56.210> set<00:01:56.420> up<00:01:56.450> a<00:01:56.540> little

00:01:56.740 --> 00:01:56.750 
out a little bit maybe set up a little

00:01:56.750 --> 00:01:58.600 
out a little bit maybe set up a little
bit<00:01:56.840> of<00:01:56.930> a<00:01:56.990> four-day<00:01:57.410> a<00:01:57.620> position<00:01:58.250> so<00:01:58.400> you<00:01:58.490> can

00:01:58.600 --> 00:01:58.610 
bit of a four-day a position so you can

00:01:58.610 --> 00:02:00.400 
bit of a four-day a position so you can
pick<00:01:58.760> up<00:01:58.910> the<00:01:59.090> expansion<00:01:59.630> on<00:01:59.690> the<00:01:59.720> right<00:02:00.110> side

00:02:00.400 --> 00:02:00.410 
pick up the expansion on the right side

00:02:00.410 --> 00:02:03.070 
pick up the expansion on the right side
possibly<00:02:00.980> at<00:02:01.640> the<00:02:01.880> three<00:02:02.360> o'clock<00:02:02.510> location

00:02:03.070 --> 00:02:03.080 
possibly at the three o'clock location

00:02:03.080 --> 00:02:06.130 
possibly at the three o'clock location
meanwhile<00:02:03.380> tons<00:02:03.650> of<00:02:03.800> gates<00:02:03.950> going<00:02:04.250> up<00:02:05.140> so

00:02:06.130 --> 00:02:06.140 
meanwhile tons of gates going up so

00:02:06.140 --> 00:02:07.450 
meanwhile tons of gates going up so
we're<00:02:06.320> probably<00:02:06.470> gonna<00:02:06.680> see<00:02:06.860> a<00:02:06.890> switch<00:02:07.400> to

00:02:07.450 --> 00:02:07.460 
we're probably gonna see a switch to

00:02:07.460 --> 00:02:10.120 
we're probably gonna see a switch to
Templar<00:02:08.360> pretty<00:02:08.600> soon<00:02:08.840> and<00:02:09.050> then<00:02:09.170> if<00:02:09.800> the<00:02:09.950> game

00:02:10.120 --> 00:02:10.130 
Templar pretty soon and then if the game

00:02:10.130 --> 00:02:13.060 
Templar pretty soon and then if the game
continues<00:02:10.580> maybe<00:02:10.790> arbiters<00:02:11.270> um<00:02:11.570> but<00:02:12.530> uh<00:02:12.560> you

00:02:13.060 --> 00:02:13.070 
continues maybe arbiters um but uh you

00:02:13.070 --> 00:02:16.000 
continues maybe arbiters um but uh you
know<00:02:13.190> it<00:02:13.430> just<00:02:14.000> it<00:02:14.120> sounds<00:02:14.570> like<00:02:14.800> for<00:02:15.800> me<00:02:15.890> at

00:02:16.000 --> 00:02:16.010 
know it just it sounds like for me at

00:02:16.010 --> 00:02:16.990 
know it just it sounds like for me at
least<00:02:16.040> it<00:02:16.280> seems<00:02:16.460> it<00:02:16.580> would<00:02:16.640> be<00:02:16.760> so<00:02:16.970> difficult

00:02:16.990 --> 00:02:17.000 
least it seems it would be so difficult

00:02:17.000 --> 00:02:18.640 
least it seems it would be so difficult
to<00:02:17.420> deal<00:02:17.570> with<00:02:17.630> flash<00:02:17.930> at<00:02:18.110> this<00:02:18.230> point<00:02:18.470> though

00:02:18.640 --> 00:02:18.650 
to deal with flash at this point though

00:02:18.650 --> 00:02:20.950 
to deal with flash at this point though
because<00:02:19.100> flash<00:02:19.580> does<00:02:20.120> have<00:02:20.330> what<00:02:20.780> he<00:02:20.930> wants

00:02:20.950 --> 00:02:20.960 
because flash does have what he wants

00:02:20.960 --> 00:02:23.170 
because flash does have what he wants
you<00:02:21.770> really<00:02:22.220> didn't<00:02:22.430> manage<00:02:22.610> the<00:02:22.670> disruption

00:02:23.170 --> 00:02:23.180 
you really didn't manage the disruption

00:02:23.180 --> 00:02:25.960 
you really didn't manage the disruption
disrupt<00:02:23.780> him<00:02:23.870> at<00:02:23.990> all<00:02:24.140> and<00:02:24.350> you<00:02:25.100> know<00:02:25.220> he's<00:02:25.640> now

00:02:25.960 --> 00:02:25.970 
disrupt him at all and you know he's now

00:02:25.970 --> 00:02:27.340 
disrupt him at all and you know he's now
has<00:02:26.180> map<00:02:26.390> control<00:02:26.720> in<00:02:26.780> the<00:02:26.840> center<00:02:27.110> actually

00:02:27.340 --> 00:02:27.350 
has map control in the center actually

00:02:27.350 --> 00:02:29.350 
has map control in the center actually
so<00:02:28.040> I<00:02:28.070> don't<00:02:28.610> know<00:02:28.700> it's<00:02:28.850> gonna<00:02:28.940> be<00:02:29.060> tough<00:02:29.210> for

00:02:29.350 --> 00:02:29.360 
so I don't know it's gonna be tough for

00:02:29.360 --> 00:02:30.610 
so I don't know it's gonna be tough for
both<00:02:29.420> T<00:02:29.690> to<00:02:29.810> move<00:02:29.960> on<00:02:30.080> i<00:02:30.110> think<00:02:30.410> from<00:02:30.500> this

00:02:30.610 --> 00:02:30.620 
both T to move on i think from this

00:02:30.620 --> 00:02:34.420 
both T to move on i think from this
point<00:02:31.660> yeah<00:02:32.660> i<00:02:32.690> think<00:02:32.780> we're<00:02:33.050> seeing<00:02:33.430> we're

00:02:34.420 --> 00:02:34.430 
point yeah i think we're seeing we're

00:02:34.430 --> 00:02:37.000 
point yeah i think we're seeing we're
seeing<00:02:34.640> a<00:02:34.760> downhill<00:02:35.030> slide<00:02:35.780> for<00:02:36.290> bolte<00:02:36.650> and<00:02:36.920> i

00:02:37.000 --> 00:02:37.010 
seeing a downhill slide for bolte and i

00:02:37.010 --> 00:02:39.610 
seeing a downhill slide for bolte and i
think<00:02:37.510> i<00:02:38.510> just<00:02:38.720> don't<00:02:39.080> think<00:02:39.140> that<00:02:39.290> he's<00:02:39.470> going

00:02:39.610 --> 00:02:39.620 
think i just don't think that he's going

00:02:39.620 --> 00:02:40.630 
think i just don't think that he's going
to<00:02:39.680> be<00:02:39.770> able<00:02:39.830> to<00:02:39.980> get<00:02:40.070> any<00:02:40.220> kind<00:02:40.430> of<00:02:40.489> position

00:02:40.630 --> 00:02:40.640 
to be able to get any kind of position

00:02:40.640 --> 00:02:42.310 
to be able to get any kind of position
you<00:02:41.360> know<00:02:41.450> a<00:02:41.480> great<00:02:41.570> thing<00:02:41.810> about<00:02:41.900> this<00:02:42.110> map

00:02:42.310 --> 00:02:42.320 
you know a great thing about this map

00:02:42.320 --> 00:02:43.690 
you know a great thing about this map
those<00:02:42.590> if<00:02:42.770> Terran<00:02:43.040> pushes<00:02:43.310> up<00:02:43.430> the<00:02:43.459> middle

00:02:43.690 --> 00:02:43.700 
those if Terran pushes up the middle

00:02:43.700 --> 00:02:46.000 
those if Terran pushes up the middle
you've<00:02:43.940> got<00:02:44.209> several<00:02:45.050> ways<00:02:45.290> to<00:02:45.320> just<00:02:45.709> run

00:02:46.000 --> 00:02:46.010 
you've got several ways to just run

00:02:46.010 --> 00:02:48.070 
you've got several ways to just run
around<00:02:46.160> and<00:02:46.670> if<00:02:47.360> it<00:02:47.480> gets<00:02:47.570> to<00:02:47.750> the<00:02:47.840> point<00:02:47.989> where

00:02:48.070 --> 00:02:48.080 
around and if it gets to the point where

00:02:48.080 --> 00:02:49.870 
around and if it gets to the point where
he<00:02:48.260> has<00:02:48.380> arbiters<00:02:48.800> I<00:02:49.040> could<00:02:49.310> see<00:02:49.489> this<00:02:49.640> map

00:02:49.870 --> 00:02:49.880 
he has arbiters I could see this map

00:02:49.880 --> 00:02:54.010 
he has arbiters I could see this map
being<00:02:50.209> a<00:02:50.480> really<00:02:51.140> great<00:02:51.500> map<00:02:51.830> for<00:02:52.130> recall<00:02:53.020> but

00:02:54.010 --> 00:02:54.020 
being a really great map for recall but

00:02:54.020 --> 00:02:55.210 
being a really great map for recall but
I<00:02:54.050> don't<00:02:54.260> think<00:02:54.320> flash<00:02:54.560> is<00:02:54.739> going<00:02:54.830> to<00:02:54.950> let<00:02:55.160> him

00:02:55.210 --> 00:02:55.220 
I don't think flash is going to let him

00:02:55.220 --> 00:02:57.760 
I don't think flash is going to let him
do<00:02:55.430> that<00:02:55.459> I<00:02:55.850> think<00:02:56.239> flash<00:02:56.450> is<00:02:56.720> going<00:02:57.470> to<00:02:57.590> be

00:02:57.760 --> 00:02:57.770 
do that I think flash is going to be

00:02:57.770 --> 00:03:00.670 
do that I think flash is going to be
aggressive<00:02:58.640> with<00:02:59.420> his<00:02:59.630> push<00:03:00.200> in<00:03:00.350> the<00:03:00.440> middle

00:03:00.670 --> 00:03:00.680 
aggressive with his push in the middle

00:03:00.680 --> 00:03:03.160 
aggressive with his push in the middle
and<00:03:00.860> he's<00:03:01.610> going<00:03:01.820> to<00:03:01.940> just<00:03:02.180> send<00:03:02.390> it<00:03:02.570> you<00:03:03.080> know

00:03:03.160 --> 00:03:03.170 
and he's going to just send it you know

00:03:03.170 --> 00:03:05.320 
and he's going to just send it you know
five<00:03:03.500> six<00:03:03.860> seven<00:03:04.040> factories<00:03:04.640> worth<00:03:04.850> of<00:03:05.030> units

00:03:05.320 --> 00:03:05.330 
five six seven factories worth of units

00:03:05.330 --> 00:03:08.350 
five six seven factories worth of units
steadily<00:03:06.110> right<00:03:06.950> up<00:03:07.070> to<00:03:07.220> the<00:03:07.310> middle<00:03:07.459> and<00:03:07.760> he

00:03:08.350 --> 00:03:08.360 
steadily right up to the middle and he

00:03:08.360 --> 00:03:11.410 
steadily right up to the middle and he
is<00:03:08.480> not<00:03:08.780> going<00:03:08.989> to<00:03:09.050> give<00:03:09.489> the<00:03:10.489> green<00:03:10.730> guy<00:03:11.000> any

00:03:11.410 --> 00:03:11.420 
is not going to give the green guy any

00:03:11.420 --> 00:03:14.110 
is not going to give the green guy any
room<00:03:12.140> to<00:03:12.170> breathe<00:03:12.560> at<00:03:12.920> all

00:03:14.110 --> 00:03:14.120 
room to breathe at all

gasps what would the reason before that

00:03:27.270 --> 00:03:31.160 
gasps what would the reason before that
action<00:03:27.600> like<00:03:27.930> just<00:03:28.470> curious<00:03:29.780> well<00:03:30.780> he's<00:03:30.930> just

been massing dragons and zealots so you

00:03:33.840 --> 00:03:35.950 
been massing dragons and zealots so you
know<00:03:33.930> there's<00:03:34.110> not<00:03:34.350> really<00:03:35.040> a<00:03:35.160> big<00:03:35.340> need<00:03:35.670> for

know there's not really a big need for
vast<00:03:36.960> amounts<00:03:37.410> of<00:03:37.410> gas<00:03:39.140> I'm<00:03:40.140> surprised<00:03:40.710> that

00:03:40.940 --> 00:03:40.950 
vast amounts of gas I'm surprised that

00:03:40.950 --> 00:03:43.220 
vast amounts of gas I'm surprised that

position for flash at this point he's

00:04:11.460 --> 00:04:13.490 
position for flash at this point he's
crowded<00:04:12.090> up<00:04:12.210> the<00:04:12.330> middle<00:04:12.510> nicely<00:04:13.080> and<00:04:13.200> we<00:04:13.410> have

00:04:13.490 --> 00:04:13.500 
crowded up the middle nicely and we have

00:04:13.500 --> 00:04:15.290 
crowded up the middle nicely and we have
a<00:04:13.530> nice<00:04:13.770> comfy<00:04:14.160> attend<00:04:14.430> in<00:04:14.550> lots<00:04:14.760> of<00:04:14.910> silence

attack<00:04:15.660> oh<00:04:15.930> the<00:04:16.890> mind<00:04:17.130> all<00:04:17.520> but<00:04:17.880> what<00:04:18.480> a<00:04:18.510> deep

00:04:19.960 --> 00:04:19.970 
attack oh the mind all but what a deep

00:04:19.970 --> 00:04:22.640 
attack oh the mind all but what a deep
yeah<00:04:20.970> I<00:04:21.000> think<00:04:21.450> flash<00:04:21.780> is<00:04:21.930> going<00:04:22.080> to<00:04:22.140> hold<00:04:22.290> so

00:04:22.640 --> 00:04:22.650 
yeah I think flash is going to hold so

00:04:22.650 --> 00:04:24.200 
yeah I think flash is going to hold so
many<00:04:22.770> tanks<00:04:23.160> in<00:04:23.220> the<00:04:23.280> back<00:04:23.490> there<00:04:23.700> I<00:04:23.910> don't

00:04:24.200 --> 00:04:24.210 
many tanks in the back there I don't

00:04:24.210 --> 00:04:25.700 
many tanks in the back there I don't
even<00:04:24.300> think<00:04:24.420> his<00:04:24.900> opponent<00:04:25.290> you<00:04:25.410> have<00:04:25.590> any

00:04:25.700 --> 00:04:25.710 
even think his opponent you have any

00:04:25.710 --> 00:04:27.350 
even think his opponent you have any
tanks<00:04:25.950> or<00:04:26.070> even<00:04:26.520> if<00:04:26.580> he<00:04:26.640> did<00:04:26.760> he<00:04:26.910> had<00:04:27.090> to<00:04:27.210> make

00:04:27.350 --> 00:04:27.360 
tanks or even if he did he had to make

00:04:27.360 --> 00:04:28.460 
tanks or even if he did he had to make
that<00:04:27.540> move<00:04:27.690> and<00:04:27.840> I<00:04:27.900> think<00:04:28.080> this<00:04:28.140> is<00:04:28.230> gonna<00:04:28.320> be<00:04:28.410> a

00:04:28.460 --> 00:04:28.470 
that move and I think this is gonna be a

00:04:28.470 --> 00:04:30.500 
that move and I think this is gonna be a
game<00:04:28.620> soon<00:04:28.830> flash<00:04:29.370> with<00:04:29.580> a<00:04:29.610> slow<00:04:29.910> push<00:04:29.940> with

00:04:30.500 --> 00:04:30.510 
game soon flash with a slow push with

00:04:30.510 --> 00:04:32.330 
game soon flash with a slow push with
supply<00:04:30.840> depots<00:04:31.230> along<00:04:31.470> the<00:04:31.650> way<00:04:31.770> putting<00:04:32.100> down

00:04:32.330 --> 00:04:32.340 
supply depots along the way putting down

00:04:32.340 --> 00:04:34.790 
supply depots along the way putting down
those<00:04:32.580> turrets<00:04:33.060> just<00:04:33.750> I<00:04:33.900> love<00:04:34.260> the<00:04:34.380> slow<00:04:34.560> push

00:04:34.790 --> 00:04:34.800 
those turrets just I love the slow push

00:04:34.800 --> 00:04:36.020 
those turrets just I love the slow push
from<00:04:34.950> Terran<00:04:35.250> actually<00:04:35.580> I<00:04:35.640> love<00:04:35.880> how<00:04:35.970> the

00:04:36.020 --> 00:04:36.030 
from Terran actually I love how the

00:04:36.030 --> 00:04:38.390 
from Terran actually I love how the
SUV's<00:04:36.480> help<00:04:36.720> on<00:04:37.380> these<00:04:37.650> attacks<00:04:38.010> and<00:04:38.220> it's

00:04:38.390 --> 00:04:38.400 
SUV's help on these attacks and it's

00:04:38.400 --> 00:04:40.790 
SUV's help on these attacks and it's
just<00:04:38.580> so<00:04:39.090> hard<00:04:39.690> for<00:04:39.840> the<00:04:40.170> Protoss<00:04:40.590> to<00:04:40.710> do

00:04:40.790 --> 00:04:40.800 
just so hard for the Protoss to do

00:04:40.800 --> 00:04:42.530 
just so hard for the Protoss to do
anything<00:04:40.980> about<00:04:41.160> it<00:04:41.310> without<00:04:41.610> either<00:04:41.820> storms

00:04:42.530 --> 00:04:42.540 
anything about it without either storms

00:04:42.540 --> 00:04:45.350 
anything about it without either storms
or<00:04:42.750> some<00:04:43.260> sort<00:04:43.440> of<00:04:43.500> drop<00:04:43.740> tech<00:04:43.980> and<00:04:44.730> oh<00:04:44.940> those

00:04:45.350 --> 00:04:45.360 
or some sort of drop tech and oh those

or some sort of drop tech and oh those
the<00:04:45.540> mines<00:04:45.690> are<00:04:45.780> actually<00:04:46.020> gonna<00:04:46.110> hit<00:04:46.260> no

00:04:46.490 --> 00:04:46.500 
the mines are actually gonna hit no

00:04:46.500 --> 00:04:48.290 
the mines are actually gonna hit no
looks<00:04:47.280> like<00:04:47.430> actually<00:04:47.730> he<00:04:47.820> might<00:04:48.000> be<00:04:48.150> able<00:04:48.210> to

00:04:48.290 --> 00:04:48.300 
looks like actually he might be able to

00:04:48.300 --> 00:04:49.790 
looks like actually he might be able to
break<00:04:48.540> through<00:04:48.780> up<00:04:49.020> there's<00:04:49.320> no<00:04:49.380> there's<00:04:49.770> more

00:04:49.790 --> 00:04:49.800 
break through up there's no there's more

00:04:49.800 --> 00:04:52.400 
break through up there's no there's more
tanks<00:04:50.220> head<00:04:50.400> back<00:04:50.960> there's<00:04:51.960> no<00:04:52.110> breathing

00:04:52.400 --> 00:04:52.410 
tanks head back there's no breathing

tanks head back there's no breathing
through<00:04:52.890> you<00:04:53.850> know<00:04:53.940> you<00:04:54.060> might<00:04:54.240> he<00:04:54.870> might

00:04:54.890 --> 00:04:54.900 
through you know you might he might

00:04:54.900 --> 00:04:56.810 
through you know you might he might
delay<00:04:55.350> it<00:04:55.500> but<00:04:55.680> he<00:04:55.770> needs<00:04:55.950> he's<00:04:56.430> got<00:04:56.610> to<00:04:56.700> do

00:04:56.810 --> 00:04:56.820 
delay it but he needs he's got to do

00:04:56.820 --> 00:05:01.220 
delay it but he needs he's got to do
something<00:04:57.500> to<00:04:58.500> flash<00:04:59.330> outside<00:05:00.330> of<00:05:00.660> you<00:05:01.200> know

00:05:01.220 --> 00:05:01.230 
something to flash outside of you know

we saw has amazing mind placement an
amazing<00:05:19.320> unit<00:05:19.590> control<00:05:19.950> and<00:05:20.220> just<00:05:20.910> doesn't

00:05:21.200 --> 00:05:21.210 
amazing unit control and just doesn't

00:05:21.210 --> 00:05:22.820 
amazing unit control and just doesn't
really<00:05:21.330> cut<00:05:21.750> a<00:05:21.780> player<00:05:22.020> any<00:05:22.260> slack<00:05:22.560> at<00:05:22.740> all

when he starts to push you know you have

00:05:25.170 --> 00:05:27.710 
when he starts to push you know you have
to<00:05:25.260> be<00:05:25.290> serious<00:05:25.650> about<00:05:26.360> finding<00:05:27.360> a<00:05:27.570> way<00:05:27.690> to

00:05:27.710 --> 00:05:27.720 
to be serious about finding a way to

00:05:27.720 --> 00:05:30.170 
to be serious about finding a way to
stop<00:05:28.080> it<00:05:28.260> and<00:05:28.400> stopping<00:05:29.400> it<00:05:29.640> does<00:05:29.820> not<00:05:29.970> include

stop it and stopping it does not include

00:05:30.180 --> 00:05:31.970 
stop it and stopping it does not include
just<00:05:30.630> throwing<00:05:31.080> units<00:05:31.380> at<00:05:31.500> the<00:05:31.590> front<00:05:31.800> of<00:05:31.860> it

00:05:31.970 --> 00:05:31.980 
just throwing units at the front of it

00:05:31.980 --> 00:05:34.010 
just throwing units at the front of it
over<00:05:32.340> writer<00:05:32.550> until<00:05:32.940> you<00:05:33.030> did<00:05:33.240> right<00:05:33.690> and<00:05:33.870> also

00:05:34.010 --> 00:05:34.020 
over writer until you did right and also

00:05:34.020 --> 00:05:36.380 
over writer until you did right and also
i<00:05:34.500> also<00:05:35.100> i<00:05:35.190> think<00:05:35.280> he<00:05:35.520> retreated<00:05:35.910> a<00:05:36.030> little<00:05:36.090> bit

00:05:36.380 --> 00:05:36.390 
i also i think he retreated a little bit

00:05:36.390 --> 00:05:38.180 
i also i think he retreated a little bit
quicker<00:05:36.600> than<00:05:36.840> he<00:05:36.900> needed<00:05:37.170> 2<00:05:37.380> he<00:05:37.740> allowed<00:05:37.980> fly

00:05:38.180 --> 00:05:38.190 
quicker than he needed 2 he allowed fly

00:05:38.190 --> 00:05:39.590 
quicker than he needed 2 he allowed fly
have<00:05:38.280> to<00:05:38.370> move<00:05:38.520> out<00:05:38.610> then<00:05:38.850> he<00:05:38.970> allow<00:05:39.120> flash<00:05:39.330> go

00:05:39.590 --> 00:05:39.600 
have to move out then he allow flash go

00:05:39.600 --> 00:05:41.360 
have to move out then he allow flash go
look<00:05:39.780> at<00:05:39.900> wheelchairs<00:05:40.500> in<00:05:40.620> my<00:05:40.770> left<00:05:40.980> hand<00:05:41.190> bay

00:05:41.360 --> 00:05:41.370 
look at wheelchairs in my left hand bay

00:05:41.370 --> 00:05:43.790 
look at wheelchairs in my left hand bay
yeah<00:05:41.610> there's<00:05:42.540> nothing<00:05:42.660> you<00:05:42.900> can<00:05:43.050> do<00:05:43.170> because

00:05:43.790 --> 00:05:43.800 
yeah there's nothing you can do because

00:05:43.800 --> 00:05:45.950 
yeah there's nothing you can do because
he's<00:05:43.950> split<00:05:44.220> in<00:05:44.310> half<00:05:44.460> now<00:05:44.670> um<00:05:44.910> you<00:05:45.600> know<00:05:45.690> it

00:05:45.950 --> 00:05:45.960 
he's split in half now um you know it

00:05:45.960 --> 00:05:48.590 
he's split in half now um you know it
the<00:05:46.350> game<00:05:46.620> is<00:05:46.770> almost<00:05:47.220> entirely<00:05:47.640> over<00:05:48.030> yeah

00:05:48.590 --> 00:05:48.600 
the game is almost entirely over yeah

00:05:48.600 --> 00:05:50.390 
the game is almost entirely over yeah
this<00:05:48.990> is<00:05:49.170> i<00:05:49.200> think<00:05:49.590> we'll<00:05:49.860> see<00:05:50.010> good<00:05:50.190> game

00:05:50.390 --> 00:05:50.400 
this is i think we'll see good game

00:05:50.400 --> 00:05:53.150 
this is i think we'll see good game
shortly<00:05:51.000> those<00:05:51.990> vultures<00:05:52.230> would<00:05:52.710> do<00:05:52.890> it<00:05:52.980> for

00:05:53.150 --> 00:05:53.160 
shortly those vultures would do it for

00:05:53.160 --> 00:05:56.030 
shortly those vultures would do it for
me<00:05:53.340> if<00:05:53.550> I<00:05:53.670> was<00:05:53.850> Protoss<00:05:54.750> if<00:05:55.350> I<00:05:55.470> was<00:05:55.590> in<00:05:55.680> Pilates

00:05:56.030 --> 00:05:56.040 
me if I was Protoss if I was in Pilates

00:05:56.040 --> 00:05:57.800 
me if I was Protoss if I was in Pilates
position<00:05:56.430> I<00:05:56.490> would<00:05:56.550> just<00:05:56.790> leave<00:05:57.000> right<00:05:57.360> now<00:05:57.420> I

00:05:57.800 --> 00:05:57.810 
position I would just leave right now I

00:05:57.810 --> 00:06:00.700 
position I would just leave right now I
just<00:05:58.370> saved<00:05:59.370> myself<00:05:59.550> the<00:05:59.820> embarrassment<00:06:00.000> of

00:06:00.700 --> 00:06:00.710 
just saved myself the embarrassment of

00:06:00.710 --> 00:06:03.250 
just saved myself the embarrassment of
waiting<00:06:01.710> till<00:06:01.860> he<00:06:02.010> killed<00:06:02.250> my<00:06:02.460> entire<00:06:02.610> base

00:06:03.250 --> 00:06:03.260 
waiting till he killed my entire base

00:06:03.260 --> 00:06:06.440 
waiting till he killed my entire base
right<00:06:04.520> and<00:06:05.520> I<00:06:05.730> think<00:06:05.970> he<00:06:06.060> should<00:06:06.240> have<00:06:06.330> gone

00:06:06.440 --> 00:06:06.450 
right and I think he should have gone

00:06:06.450 --> 00:06:08.090 
right and I think he should have gone
for<00:06:06.630> some<00:06:06.780> kind<00:06:06.960> of<00:06:06.990> cheese<00:06:07.230> absolutely<00:06:07.860> i

00:06:10.280 --> 00:06:10.290 
think the yeah proxy robotics facility

00:06:10.290 --> 00:06:13.400 
think the yeah proxy robotics facility
or<00:06:10.860> you<00:06:11.040> know<00:06:11.160> a<00:06:11.790> fast<00:06:12.510> dt<00:06:12.870> drop<00:06:13.080> little<00:06:13.230> worked

00:06:13.400 --> 00:06:13.410 
or you know a fast dt drop little worked

00:06:13.410 --> 00:06:15.350 
or you know a fast dt drop little worked
out<00:06:13.560> for<00:06:13.710> a<00:06:13.770> better<00:06:13.920> GG<00:06:14.400> coming<00:06:14.760> from<00:06:14.940> bolte

00:06:15.350 --> 00:06:15.360 
out for a better GG coming from bolte

00:06:15.360 --> 00:06:17.900 
out for a better GG coming from bolte
flash<00:06:15.930> winds<00:06:16.380> uh<00:06:16.410> pretty<00:06:17.190> predictably<00:06:17.670> and

00:06:17.900 --> 00:06:17.910 
flash winds uh pretty predictably and

00:06:17.910 --> 00:06:19.340 
flash winds uh pretty predictably and
now<00:06:18.030> he<00:06:18.090> faces<00:06:18.360> the<00:06:18.600> final<00:06:18.930> battle<00:06:19.170> against

00:06:19.340 --> 00:06:19.350 
now he faces the final battle against

00:06:19.350 --> 00:06:21.200 
now he faces the final battle against
yellow<00:06:19.680> our<00:06:19.830> neck<00:06:20.040> yar<00:06:20.580> neck<00:06:20.760> beat<00:06:20.940> him<00:06:21.060> in<00:06:21.150> the

00:06:21.200 --> 00:06:21.210 
yellow our neck yar neck beat him in the

00:06:21.210 --> 00:06:22.460 
yellow our neck yar neck beat him in the
first<00:06:21.390> game<00:06:21.570> with<00:06:21.720> a<00:06:21.780> nine<00:06:21.930> pool<00:06:22.170> although

00:06:22.460 --> 00:06:22.470 
first game with a nine pool although

00:06:22.470 --> 00:06:24.410 
first game with a nine pool although
next<00:06:22.740> game<00:06:23.010> I<00:06:23.370> think<00:06:23.580> flash<00:06:24.030> might<00:06:24.270> be<00:06:24.390> a

00:06:24.410 --> 00:06:24.420 
next game I think flash might be a

00:06:24.420 --> 00:06:25.940 
next game I think flash might be a
little<00:06:24.570> more<00:06:24.720> careful<00:06:25.140> and<00:06:25.290> your<00:06:25.650> neck<00:06:25.800> might

00:06:25.940 --> 00:06:25.950 
little more careful and your neck might

00:06:25.950 --> 00:06:28.190 
little more careful and your neck might
not<00:06:26.070> be<00:06:26.190> so<00:06:26.310> lucky<00:06:26.340> on<00:06:27.330> the<00:06:27.510> FINA<00:06:27.720> which<00:06:27.990> is<00:06:28.170> a

not be so lucky on the FINA which is a

00:06:34.710 --> 00:06:36.440 
poor bolte I mean I think you would have
been<00:06:35.010> better<00:06:35.160> just<00:06:35.250> going<00:06:36.000> for<00:06:36.120> the<00:06:36.180> cheese

00:06:36.440 --> 00:06:36.450 
been better just going for the cheese
