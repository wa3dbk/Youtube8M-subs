how<00:00:13.230> to<00:00:13.259> create<00:00:13.530> a<00:00:13.830> form<00:00:14.160> to<00:00:14.790> enter<00:00:14.820> data<00:00:15.540> into

00:00:15.770 --> 00:00:15.780 
how to create a form to enter data into

00:00:15.780 --> 00:00:21.490 
how to create a form to enter data into
your<00:00:16.049> tables<00:00:18.500> so<00:00:19.500> we'll<00:00:19.619> hop<00:00:19.859> right<00:00:20.100> to<00:00:20.160> it<00:00:20.400> in

00:00:21.490 --> 00:00:21.500 
your tables so we'll hop right to it in

00:00:21.500 --> 00:00:23.599 
your tables so we'll hop right to it in
Microsoft<00:00:22.500> Access<00:00:22.740> once<00:00:23.279> you<00:00:23.400> have<00:00:23.519> your

00:00:23.599 --> 00:00:23.609 
Microsoft Access once you have your

Microsoft Access once you have your
tables<00:00:24.029> set<00:00:24.240> up<00:00:24.269> go<00:00:24.840> to<00:00:24.900> create<00:00:26.210> and<00:00:27.210> we're

00:00:27.380 --> 00:00:27.390 
tables set up go to create and we're

00:00:27.390 --> 00:00:28.910 
tables set up go to create and we're
going<00:00:27.510> to<00:00:27.539> use<00:00:27.689> the<00:00:27.840> wizard<00:00:28.050> for<00:00:28.410> stuff<00:00:28.769> in

this just asks how you want to view your

00:00:52.920 --> 00:00:55.880 
this just asks how you want to view your
data<00:00:53.300> we<00:00:54.300> want<00:00:54.510> our<00:00:54.660> header<00:00:54.840> information<00:00:55.199> and

00:00:55.880 --> 00:00:55.890 
data we want our header information and

00:00:55.890 --> 00:00:58.430 
data we want our header information and
then<00:00:56.039> the<00:00:56.309> other<00:00:56.460> information<00:00:56.940> the<00:00:57.930> component

then the other information the component
information<00:00:59.390> on<00:01:00.390> a<00:01:00.449> subform<00:01:00.960> so<00:01:01.379> we'll<00:01:01.530> go

00:01:01.639 --> 00:01:01.649 
information on a subform so we'll go

00:01:01.649 --> 00:01:05.390 
information on a subform so we'll go
ahead<00:01:01.770> and<00:01:01.890> say<00:01:02.190> next<00:01:03.890> we're<00:01:04.890> going<00:01:04.979> to<00:01:05.040> stay

00:01:05.390 --> 00:01:05.400 
ahead and say next we're going to stay

00:01:05.400 --> 00:01:08.870 
ahead and say next we're going to stay
with<00:01:05.580> the<00:01:05.700> datasheet<00:01:06.240> view<00:01:06.270> and<00:01:07.430> then<00:01:08.430> you<00:01:08.640> can

00:01:08.870 --> 00:01:08.880 
with the datasheet view and then you can

00:01:08.880 --> 00:01:11.510 
with the datasheet view and then you can
give<00:01:09.119> your<00:01:09.479> forms<00:01:10.350> a<00:01:10.470> name<00:01:10.680> so<00:01:11.189> I'm<00:01:11.280> just<00:01:11.400> going

00:01:11.510 --> 00:01:11.520 
give your forms a name so I'm just going

00:01:11.520 --> 00:01:15.770 
give your forms a name so I'm just going
to<00:01:11.610> call<00:01:11.729> it<00:01:11.760> frm<00:01:12.299> perform<00:01:12.890> data<00:01:13.890> entry<00:01:14.780> and

00:01:15.770 --> 00:01:15.780 
to call it frm perform data entry and

00:01:15.780 --> 00:01:18.280 
to call it frm perform data entry and
then<00:01:16.650> subform<00:01:17.250> I'm<00:01:17.340> just<00:01:17.580> going<00:01:17.759> to<00:01:17.820> write<00:01:17.939> s

00:01:18.280 --> 00:01:18.290 
then subform I'm just going to write s

00:01:18.290 --> 00:01:23.719 
then subform I'm just going to write s
frm<00:01:19.290> for<00:01:19.560> subform<00:01:20.100> data<00:01:20.460> entry<00:01:22.520> these<00:01:23.520> are

00:01:23.719 --> 00:01:23.729 
frm for subform data entry these are

00:01:23.729 --> 00:01:25.280 
frm for subform data entry these are
what<00:01:23.909> they<00:01:24.060> will<00:01:24.180> be<00:01:24.299> named<00:01:24.540> when<00:01:25.110> they're

00:01:25.280 --> 00:01:25.290 
what they will be named when they're

00:01:25.290 --> 00:01:28.899 
what they will be named when they're
added<00:01:25.590> over<00:01:25.830> on<00:01:26.250> this<00:01:26.490> left<00:01:26.970> navigation<00:01:27.299> pane

00:01:28.899 --> 00:01:28.909 
added over on this left navigation pane

00:01:28.909 --> 00:01:32.660 
added over on this left navigation pane
so<00:01:29.909> we're<00:01:30.509> going<00:01:30.780> to<00:01:30.930> open<00:01:31.590> the<00:01:31.979> form<00:01:32.220> to<00:01:32.400> view

00:01:32.660 --> 00:01:32.670 
so we're going to open the form to view

00:01:32.670 --> 00:01:35.270 
so we're going to open the form to view
and<00:01:32.909> enter<00:01:33.450> the<00:01:33.570> information<00:01:33.780> right<00:01:34.259> away<00:01:34.290> go

00:01:35.270 --> 00:01:35.280 
and enter the information right away go

00:01:35.280 --> 00:01:38.539 
and enter the information right away go
ahead<00:01:35.369> and<00:01:35.579> click<00:01:35.729> finish<00:01:36.329> and<00:01:37.250> then<00:01:38.250> your

00:01:38.539 --> 00:01:38.549 
ahead and click finish and then your

00:01:38.549 --> 00:01:40.490 
ahead and click finish and then your
form<00:01:38.790> will<00:01:38.970> pop<00:01:39.180> up<00:01:39.210> we're<00:01:40.049> just<00:01:40.259> going<00:01:40.470> to

00:01:40.490 --> 00:01:40.500 
form will pop up we're just going to

00:01:40.500 --> 00:01:43.429 
form will pop up we're just going to
minimize<00:01:41.220> this<00:01:41.640> navigation<00:01:42.180> pane<00:01:42.390> so<00:01:43.140> that<00:01:43.290> we

00:01:43.429 --> 00:01:43.439 
minimize this navigation pane so that we

00:01:43.439 --> 00:01:44.679 
minimize this navigation pane so that we
can<00:01:43.649> see<00:01:43.920> better

00:01:44.679 --> 00:01:44.689 
can see better

00:01:44.689 --> 00:01:47.569 
can see better
looks<00:01:45.689> like<00:01:45.899> our<00:01:46.049> unit<00:01:46.439> cost<00:01:46.799> is<00:01:47.100> getting<00:01:47.369> cut

00:01:47.569 --> 00:01:47.579 
looks like our unit cost is getting cut

00:01:47.579 --> 00:01:49.819 
looks like our unit cost is getting cut
off<00:01:47.610> so<00:01:48.030> we're<00:01:48.210> going<00:01:48.299> to<00:01:48.360> go<00:01:48.570> to<00:01:48.630> the<00:01:48.829> design

00:01:49.819 --> 00:01:49.829 
off so we're going to go to the design

00:01:49.829 --> 00:01:51.710 
off so we're going to go to the design
view<00:01:49.860> of<00:01:50.189> the<00:01:50.310> form<00:01:50.579> to<00:01:50.939> make<00:01:51.060> the<00:01:51.540> necessary

00:02:12.830 --> 00:02:12.840 
my subform since that was too small

00:02:12.840 --> 00:02:14.780 
my subform since that was too small
and<00:02:13.230> I'm<00:02:13.470> just<00:02:13.650> going<00:02:13.830> to<00:02:13.920> get<00:02:14.130> it<00:02:14.250> so<00:02:14.490> that<00:02:14.520> the

00:02:14.780 --> 00:02:14.790 
and I'm just going to get it so that the

00:02:14.790 --> 00:02:20.090 
and I'm just going to get it so that the
arrows<00:02:15.120> are<00:02:15.530> going<00:02:18.080> horizontally<00:02:19.080> and<00:02:19.380> click

00:02:20.090 --> 00:02:20.100 
arrows are going horizontally and click

00:02:20.100 --> 00:02:23.150 
arrows are going horizontally and click
and<00:02:20.250> drag<00:02:20.459> it<00:02:20.610> over<00:02:20.880> a<00:02:20.940> little<00:02:21.060> bit<00:02:22.010> once<00:02:23.010> I

00:02:23.150 --> 00:02:23.160 
and drag it over a little bit once I

00:02:23.160 --> 00:02:25.640 
and drag it over a little bit once I
think<00:02:23.220> it's<00:02:23.610> exactly<00:02:23.910> how<00:02:24.569> I<00:02:24.600> want<00:02:24.959> it<00:02:25.140> I<00:02:25.319> can

00:02:25.640 --> 00:02:25.650 
think it's exactly how I want it I can

00:02:25.650 --> 00:02:29.750 
think it's exactly how I want it I can
go<00:02:25.800> back<00:02:26.010> to<00:02:26.490> the<00:02:27.300> forum<00:02:27.959> view<00:02:28.310> the<00:02:29.310> shortcut

00:02:29.750 --> 00:02:29.760 
go back to the forum view the shortcut

00:02:29.760 --> 00:02:33.880 
go back to the forum view the shortcut
would<00:02:29.880> be<00:02:30.000> just<00:02:30.209> to<00:02:30.330> click<00:02:30.540> this<00:02:30.780> right<00:02:31.020> here

00:02:33.880 --> 00:02:33.890 

00:02:33.890 --> 00:02:37.880 

so<00:02:34.890> now<00:02:35.040> we<00:02:35.100> can<00:02:35.310> see<00:02:35.520> our<00:02:35.610> unit<00:02:35.910> cost<00:02:36.860> so<00:02:37.860> you

00:02:37.880 --> 00:02:37.890 
so now we can see our unit cost so you

00:02:37.890 --> 00:02:39.590 
so now we can see our unit cost so you
can<00:02:38.010> go<00:02:38.430> to<00:02:38.489> design<00:02:38.819> view<00:02:38.880> and<00:02:39.120> pretty<00:02:39.390> it<00:02:39.540> up

00:02:39.590 --> 00:02:39.600 
can go to design view and pretty it up

00:02:39.600 --> 00:02:41.660 
can go to design view and pretty it up
as<00:02:39.780> much<00:02:40.440> as<00:02:40.650> you'd<00:02:40.800> like<00:02:40.830> I'm<00:02:41.340> just<00:02:41.489> going<00:02:41.640> to

00:02:41.660 --> 00:02:41.670 
as much as you'd like I'm just going to

00:02:41.670 --> 00:02:44.120 
as much as you'd like I'm just going to
keep<00:02:41.819> it<00:02:41.940> simple<00:02:42.150> at<00:02:42.480> this<00:02:42.660> point<00:02:43.069> show<00:02:44.069> you

00:02:44.130 --> 00:02:46.250 
keep it simple at this point show you
that<00:02:44.610> we<00:02:44.700> can<00:02:44.850> enter<00:02:45.120> our<00:02:45.150> item<00:02:45.480> code<00:02:45.720> now<00:02:45.930> so

00:02:46.250 --> 00:02:46.260 
that we can enter our item code now so

00:02:46.260 --> 00:02:50.780 
that we can enter our item code now so
let's<00:02:46.530> put<00:02:46.860> in<00:02:46.980> a<00:02:47.390> test<00:02:48.390> item<00:02:49.070> then<00:02:50.070> you<00:02:50.640> can

00:02:50.780 --> 00:02:50.790 
let's put in a test item then you can

00:02:50.790 --> 00:02:53.479 
let's put in a test item then you can
put<00:02:50.910> into<00:02:51.150> the<00:02:51.269> items<00:02:51.600> description<00:02:52.400> for<00:02:53.400> the

00:03:31.009 --> 00:03:31.019 
over here you'll see that you have the

00:03:31.019 --> 00:03:33.380 
over here you'll see that you have the
two<00:03:31.200> forms<00:03:31.680> you<00:03:32.190> just<00:03:32.400> created<00:03:32.850> a<00:03:32.910> form<00:03:33.180> data

00:03:33.380 --> 00:03:33.390 
two forms you just created a form data

00:03:33.390 --> 00:03:35.990 
two forms you just created a form data
entry<00:03:33.810> and<00:03:34.019> subform<00:03:34.590> data<00:03:34.739> entry<00:03:35.160> you<00:03:35.760> want<00:03:35.910> to

entry and subform data entry you want to

00:03:36.000 --> 00:03:37.400 
entry and subform data entry you want to
open<00:03:36.120> either<00:03:36.390> those<00:03:36.720> just<00:03:37.019> feel<00:03:37.200> free<00:03:37.380> to

open either those just feel free to
double<00:03:37.739> click<00:03:37.920> and<00:03:38.489> then<00:03:39.170> we<00:03:40.170> also<00:03:40.350> have

00:03:40.910 --> 00:03:40.920 
double click and then we also have

00:03:40.920 --> 00:03:44.300 
double click and then we also have
information<00:03:41.190> in<00:03:42.109> our<00:03:43.109> bill<00:03:43.680> header<00:03:43.920> so<00:03:44.220> we

00:03:44.300 --> 00:03:44.310 
information in our bill header so we

00:03:44.310 --> 00:03:46.910 
information in our bill header so we
have<00:03:44.430> our<00:03:44.519> test<00:03:44.760> item<00:03:45.120> and<00:03:45.329> description<00:03:45.930> and

00:03:46.910 --> 00:03:46.920 
have our test item and description and

00:03:46.920 --> 00:03:50.300 
have our test item and description and
we<00:03:47.190> also<00:03:47.340> have<00:03:47.989> that<00:03:48.989> link<00:03:49.350> so<00:03:49.500> the<00:03:49.739> test<00:03:49.980> item

00:03:50.300 --> 00:03:50.310 
we also have that link so the test item

00:03:50.310 --> 00:03:53.090 
we also have that link so the test item
code<00:03:50.519> has<00:03:50.910> two<00:03:51.299> components<00:03:51.930> on<00:03:52.079> it<00:03:52.109> and<00:03:52.440> that

00:03:53.090 --> 00:03:53.100 
code has two components on it and that

00:03:53.100 --> 00:03:56.030 
code has two components on it and that
has<00:03:53.660> their<00:03:54.660> Associated<00:03:55.320> descriptions<00:03:55.890> in

00:03:56.030 --> 00:03:56.040 
has their Associated descriptions in

00:03:56.040 --> 00:04:01.190
