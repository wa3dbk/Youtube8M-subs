00:03:27.560 --> 00:03:27.570 
fridge but probably the best thing of

00:03:27.570 --> 00:03:29.960 
fridge but probably the best thing of
all<00:03:27.690> this<00:03:27.870> probably<00:03:28.590> a<00:03:28.800> tomato<00:03:29.220> passata

00:03:29.960 --> 00:03:29.970 
all this probably a tomato passata

but the cassava comes in the jars with a
lid<00:03:32.430> on<00:03:32.459> that's<00:03:32.730> probably<00:03:33.270> the<00:03:33.420> best<00:03:33.570> to<00:03:33.780> use

00:03:36.640 --> 00:03:36.650 

00:03:36.650 --> 00:03:41.710 

so<00:03:40.000> just<00:03:41.000> couldn't<00:03:41.239> I<00:03:41.269> make<00:03:41.390> sure<00:03:41.540> you<00:03:41.569> can

bottom<00:03:43.519> of<00:03:43.610> the<00:03:43.670> pan<00:03:43.879> so<00:03:44.780> all<00:03:45.049> the<00:03:45.140> flavor<00:03:45.409> is

00:03:48.990 --> 00:03:49.000 

00:03:49.000 --> 00:03:55.300 

and<00:03:50.000> then<00:03:50.120> turn<00:03:50.360> the<00:03:50.450> heat<00:03:50.480> up<00:03:53.980> and<00:03:54.980> let<00:03:55.220> that

and then turn the heat up and let that

00:03:55.310 --> 00:03:58.210 
and then turn the heat up and let that
cooks<00:03:55.640> and<00:03:55.849> let<00:03:56.030> that<00:03:56.120> cook<00:03:56.450> for<00:03:56.510> about<00:03:57.220> one

00:03:58.210 --> 00:03:58.220 
cooks and let that cook for about one

00:03:58.220 --> 00:03:59.589 
cooks and let that cook for about one
until<00:03:58.459> the<00:03:58.549> pass<00:03:58.730> is<00:03:58.909> ready<00:03:59.060> it's<00:03:59.239> about<00:03:59.299> eight

minutes
I<00:04:54.229> had<00:04:54.889> a<00:04:54.919> couple<00:04:55.189> of<00:04:55.249> spoonfuls<00:04:55.520> of<00:04:55.819> the<00:04:55.909> past

00:04:56.080 --> 00:04:56.090 
I had a couple of spoonfuls of the past

00:04:56.090 --> 00:05:02.070 
I had a couple of spoonfuls of the past
the<00:04:56.240> water

00:05:02.070 --> 00:05:02.080 

00:05:02.080 --> 00:05:04.540 

so<00:05:03.080> three<00:05:03.289> spoons<00:05:03.529> pass<00:05:03.710> water<00:05:03.919> and<00:05:04.279> then<00:05:04.520> just

00:05:04.550 --> 00:05:06.459 
so three spoons pass water and then just
cook<00:05:04.849> it<00:05:04.909> still<00:05:05.180> really<00:05:05.389> al<00:05:05.479> dente<00:05:05.869> it's<00:05:06.319> gonna

00:05:06.459 --> 00:05:06.469 
cook it still really al dente it's gonna

00:05:06.469 --> 00:05:08.859 
cook it still really al dente it's gonna
cook<00:05:06.740> the<00:05:07.460> pasta<00:05:07.699> in<00:05:08.029> Majer<00:05:08.330> sauce<00:05:08.539> so<00:05:08.749> that

00:05:08.859 --> 00:05:08.869 
cook the pasta in Majer sauce so that

00:05:08.869 --> 00:05:11.230 
cook the pasta in Majer sauce so that
sauce<00:05:09.169> really<00:05:10.009> gets<00:05:10.249> absorbed<00:05:10.430> into<00:05:10.999> the

00:05:11.230 --> 00:05:11.240 
sauce really gets absorbed into the

00:05:11.240 --> 00:05:14.200 
sauce really gets absorbed into the
pasta<00:05:12.129> and<00:05:13.129> the<00:05:13.249> temptation<00:05:13.759> of<00:05:13.789> this<00:05:13.939> is<00:05:14.119> to

00:05:14.200 --> 00:05:14.210 
pasta and the temptation of this is to

00:05:14.210 --> 00:05:16.420 
pasta and the temptation of this is to
add<00:05:14.330> lots<00:05:14.569> of<00:05:14.689> herbs<00:05:14.930> add<00:05:15.199> some<00:05:15.409> parsley<00:05:16.219> add

the penne all the source ghosts get

00:05:27.559 --> 00:05:29.409 
the penne all the source ghosts get
stuck<00:05:27.830> in<00:05:28.009> there<00:05:28.219> and<00:05:28.249> on<00:05:28.399> those<00:05:28.490> ridges<00:05:28.789> it'll

00:05:29.409 --> 00:05:29.419 
stuck in there and on those ridges it'll

00:05:29.419 --> 00:05:31.570 
stuck in there and on those ridges it'll
kind<00:05:29.629> of<00:05:29.659> really<00:05:29.869> absorb<00:05:30.199> into<00:05:30.469> the<00:05:30.680> pasta<00:05:31.069> so
