00:00:39.160 --> 00:00:39.170 
the best ultra in AE I'm not the best

00:00:41.030 --> 00:00:43.509 
all to the best super nayi getting
nerfed<00:00:41.210> isn't<00:00:41.629> a<00:00:41.900> big<00:00:42.379> thing<00:00:42.830> well<00:00:43.040> it<00:00:43.129> is<00:00:43.250> but

00:00:43.509 --> 00:00:43.519 
nerfed isn't a big thing well it is but

00:00:43.519 --> 00:00:45.460

00:00:45.460 --> 00:00:45.470 
it's still really good the reason I

00:00:45.470 --> 00:00:47.649 
it's still really good the reason I
think<00:00:46.159> people<00:00:46.489> should<00:00:46.519> still<00:00:46.940> use<00:00:46.970> an<00:00:47.360> agent

00:00:47.649 --> 00:00:47.659 
think people should still use an agent

00:00:47.659 --> 00:00:49.149 
think people should still use an agent
and<00:00:47.780> stock<00:00:47.989> their<00:00:48.170> bar<00:00:48.320> for<00:00:48.559> it<00:00:48.650> is<00:00:48.769> because

00:00:49.149 --> 00:00:49.159 
and stock their bar for it is because

00:00:49.159 --> 00:00:51.700 
and stock their bar for it is because
jaan<00:00:49.940> doesn't<00:00:50.059> have<00:00:50.390> that<00:00:50.600> like<00:00:51.260> much<00:00:51.470> use<00:00:51.680> for

but<00:02:42.390> I<00:02:42.570> don't<00:02:42.810> know<00:02:42.870> I'm<00:02:42.930> just<00:02:43.080> used<00:02:43.260> to<00:02:43.320> it<00:02:43.410> so

00:02:43.700 --> 00:02:43.710 
but I don't know I'm just used to it so

00:02:43.710 --> 00:02:56.540 
but I don't know I'm just used to it so
yeah<00:02:54.080> so<00:02:55.080> that's<00:02:55.260> the<00:02:55.410> reset<00:02:55.740> right<00:02:55.890> there<00:02:56.040> 230

00:02:56.540 --> 00:02:56.550 
yeah so that's the reset right there 230

00:02:56.550 --> 00:02:58.070 
yeah so that's the reset right there 230
damage<00:02:57.030> off<00:02:57.180> the<00:02:57.330> reset<00:02:57.630> that's<00:02:57.840> it<00:02:57.959> they

00:02:58.070 --> 00:02:58.080 
damage off the reset that's it they

00:02:58.080 --> 00:03:00.440 
damage off the reset that's it they
block<00:02:58.320> behind<00:02:58.500> the<00:02:58.920> thing<00:02:59.490> with<00:02:59.940> ending<00:03:00.330> like

00:03:00.440 --> 00:03:00.450 
block behind the thing with ending like

00:03:00.450 --> 00:03:03.920 
block behind the thing with ending like
this<00:03:00.480> is<00:03:00.840> you<00:03:00.959> can<00:03:00.989> go<00:03:01.260> low<00:03:01.530> behind<00:03:02.040> them<00:03:02.930> you

00:03:03.920 --> 00:03:03.930 
this is you can go low behind them you

00:03:03.930 --> 00:03:10.400 
this is you can go low behind them you
can<00:03:04.110> go<00:03:04.260> low<00:03:04.440> in<00:03:04.620> front<00:03:04.860> of<00:03:04.950> them<00:03:05.070> whoops<00:03:09.410> you

00:03:10.400 --> 00:03:10.410 
can go low in front of them whoops you

00:03:10.410 --> 00:03:11.840 
can go low in front of them whoops you
can<00:03:10.530> go<00:03:10.620> low<00:03:10.800> in<00:03:10.950> front<00:03:11.130> of<00:03:11.220> them<00:03:11.310> you<00:03:11.520> can<00:03:11.640> go

00:03:11.840 --> 00:03:11.850 
can go low in front of them you can go

00:03:11.850 --> 00:03:14.780 
can go low in front of them you can go
like<00:03:12.269> I<00:03:12.390> said<00:03:12.450> low<00:03:12.810> behind<00:03:13.170> them<00:03:13.610> you<00:03:14.610> can

00:03:14.780 --> 00:03:14.790 
like I said low behind them you can

00:03:14.790 --> 00:03:16.160 
like I said low behind them you can
pretty<00:03:15.060> much<00:03:15.180> do<00:03:15.450> whatever<00:03:15.600> you<00:03:15.870> want<00:03:16.019> after

00:03:16.160 --> 00:03:16.170 
pretty much do whatever you want after

00:03:16.170 --> 00:03:20.270 
pretty much do whatever you want after
this<00:03:18.170> something<00:03:19.170> you<00:03:19.260> might<00:03:19.410> want<00:03:19.470> to<00:03:19.950> do<00:03:20.070> is

00:03:20.270 --> 00:03:20.280 
this something you might want to do is

00:03:20.280 --> 00:03:23.449 
this something you might want to do is
just<00:03:20.989> just<00:03:21.989> jump<00:03:22.260> because<00:03:22.860> if<00:03:23.130> they<00:03:23.250> do<00:03:23.310> a

00:03:23.449 --> 00:03:23.459 
just just jump because if they do a

00:03:23.459 --> 00:03:25.790 
just just jump because if they do a
tiger<00:03:23.790> uppercut<00:03:23.880> you'll<00:03:24.840> jump<00:03:25.050> right<00:03:25.380> over<00:03:25.440> it

00:03:25.790 --> 00:03:25.800 
tiger uppercut you'll jump right over it

00:03:25.800 --> 00:03:27.020 
tiger uppercut you'll jump right over it
if<00:03:25.920> they<00:03:26.040> do<00:03:26.100> sure<00:03:26.370> you<00:03:26.550> can<00:03:26.700> you'll<00:03:26.880> jump

00:03:27.020 --> 00:03:27.030 
if they do sure you can you'll jump

00:03:27.030 --> 00:03:29.750 
if they do sure you can you'll jump
right<00:03:27.180> over<00:03:27.239> and<00:03:27.600> then<00:03:27.720> you<00:03:27.810> give<00:03:27.930> it<00:03:28.050> a<00:03:28.760> free

00:03:29.750 --> 00:03:29.760 
right over and then you give it a free

00:03:29.760 --> 00:03:31.520 
right over and then you give it a free
punish<00:03:30.090> of<00:03:30.209> 238<00:03:30.630> damage<00:03:31.019> so<00:03:31.200> that's<00:03:31.380> why<00:03:31.500> I

00:03:31.520 --> 00:03:31.530 
punish of 238 damage so that's why I

00:03:31.530 --> 00:03:33.410 
punish of 238 damage so that's why I
like<00:03:31.590> to<00:03:31.800> end<00:03:31.980> my<00:03:32.070> pretty<00:03:32.970> much<00:03:33.090> all<00:03:33.269> my

00:03:33.410 --> 00:03:33.420 
like to end my pretty much all my

00:03:33.420 --> 00:03:35.540 
like to end my pretty much all my
Keynesians<00:03:33.840> with<00:03:33.989> this<00:03:34.170> maybe<00:03:35.130> even<00:03:35.250> this

00:03:35.540 --> 00:03:35.550 
Keynesians with this maybe even this

00:03:35.550 --> 00:03:39.350 
Keynesians with this maybe even this
sometimes<00:03:36.000> but<00:03:36.390> it's<00:03:36.690> harder<00:03:37.019> like<00:03:37.230> the<00:03:38.360> Heian

00:03:39.350 --> 00:03:39.360 
sometimes but it's harder like the Heian

00:03:39.360 --> 00:03:40.520 
sometimes but it's harder like the Heian
do<00:03:39.570> with<00:03:39.690> this<00:03:39.810> because<00:03:40.110> it<00:03:40.230> does<00:03:40.320> more<00:03:40.470> damage

00:03:40.520 --> 00:03:40.530 
do with this because it does more damage

00:03:40.530 --> 00:03:43.850 
do with this because it does more damage
than<00:03:40.920> divekick<00:03:41.400> but<00:03:42.470> usually<00:03:43.470> when<00:03:43.560> people

00:03:43.850 --> 00:03:43.860 
than divekick but usually when people

00:03:43.860 --> 00:03:45.350 
than divekick but usually when people
see<00:03:44.010> the<00:03:44.130> light<00:03:44.310> kick<00:03:44.519> that<00:03:44.670> cake<00:03:44.940> they<00:03:45.060> assume

00:03:45.350 --> 00:03:45.360 
see the light kick that cake they assume

00:03:45.360 --> 00:03:46.729 
see the light kick that cake they assume
you'll<00:03:45.600> end<00:03:45.810> in<00:03:45.989> front<00:03:46.200> of<00:03:46.290> them<00:03:46.350> because<00:03:46.470> like

00:03:46.729 --> 00:03:46.739 
you'll end in front of them because like

00:03:46.739 --> 00:03:49.430 
you'll end in front of them because like
the<00:03:46.890> Ark<00:03:47.070> is<00:03:47.280> really<00:03:47.519> low<00:03:48.030> when<00:03:48.989> I<00:03:49.080> see<00:03:49.260> this

00:03:49.430 --> 00:03:49.440 
the Ark is really low when I see this

00:03:49.440 --> 00:03:50.509 
the Ark is really low when I see this
like<00:03:49.739> they<00:03:49.860> might<00:03:50.010> think<00:03:50.160> you're<00:03:50.310> going

00:03:50.509 --> 00:03:50.519 
like they might think you're going

00:03:50.519 --> 00:03:53.960 
like they might think you're going
behind<00:03:50.610> I<00:03:50.970> don't<00:03:51.209> know<00:03:51.269> its<00:03:51.930> preference<00:03:52.910> so<00:03:53.910> I

00:03:53.960 --> 00:03:53.970 
behind I don't know its preference so I

00:03:53.970 --> 00:03:57.890 
behind I don't know its preference so I
like<00:03:54.150> to<00:03:54.180> end<00:03:54.390> my<00:03:54.450> agents<00:03:55.019> with<00:03:55.110> that<00:03:55.290> um<00:03:56.900> last

00:03:57.890 --> 00:03:57.900 
like to end my agents with that um last

00:03:57.900 --> 00:03:59.630 
like to end my agents with that um last
thing<00:03:58.080> I<00:03:58.110> want<00:03:58.230> to<00:03:58.260> talk<00:03:58.410> about<00:03:58.470> is<00:03:58.950> scaling

00:03:59.630 --> 00:03:59.640 
thing I want to talk about is scaling

00:03:59.640 --> 00:04:02.780 
thing I want to talk about is scaling
sometimes<00:04:00.060> I've<00:04:00.269> seen<00:04:00.540> people<00:04:00.720> do<00:04:01.610> with<00:04:02.610> the

00:04:02.780 --> 00:04:02.790 
sometimes I've seen people do with the

00:04:02.790 --> 00:04:05.360 
sometimes I've seen people do with the
hold<00:04:03.060> on<00:04:03.180> I<00:04:03.390> feel<00:04:03.570> like<00:04:03.750> it's<00:04:04.050> like<00:04:04.370> okay

00:04:05.360 --> 00:04:05.370 
hold on I feel like it's like okay

00:04:05.370 --> 00:04:06.800 
hold on I feel like it's like okay
sometimes<00:04:05.730> off

Canadian by the time they can agent
comes<00:04:16.709> out<00:04:16.889> the<00:04:17.100> damage<00:04:17.790> scaling<00:04:18.000> has<00:04:18.299> already

00:04:18.500 --> 00:04:18.510

you<00:04:24.960> can<00:04:25.110> see<00:04:26.690> see<00:04:27.690> so<00:04:28.260> i'll<00:04:28.320> show<00:04:28.470> you<00:04:28.560> what<00:04:28.650> i

00:04:28.700 --> 00:04:28.710 
you can see see so i'll show you what i

00:04:28.710 --> 00:04:31.340 
you can see see so i'll show you what i
like<00:04:28.889> to<00:04:29.010> do<00:04:29.130> in<00:04:29.220> this<00:04:29.310> situation<00:04:29.550> if<00:04:30.120> it<00:04:31.110> does

00:04:31.340 --> 00:04:31.350 
like to do in this situation if it does

00:04:31.350 --> 00:04:33.280 
like to do in this situation if it does
occur<00:04:31.500> where<00:04:32.010> you<00:04:32.160> know<00:04:32.280> you<00:04:32.340> think<00:04:32.669> you<00:04:32.790> can

00:04:33.280 --> 00:04:33.290 
occur where you know you think you can

00:04:33.290 --> 00:04:36.080 
occur where you know you think you can
like<00:04:34.290> wrap<00:04:34.590> the<00:04:34.830> game<00:04:35.070> up<00:04:35.280> with<00:04:35.490> a<00:04:35.520> contagion

00:04:36.080 --> 00:04:36.090 
like wrap the game up with a contagion

00:04:36.090 --> 00:04:39.969 
like wrap the game up with a contagion
but<00:04:36.270> maybe<00:04:36.540> not<00:04:36.780> because<00:04:37.440> you<00:04:37.830> did<00:04:38.040> so<00:04:38.280> much

00:04:39.969 --> 00:04:39.979 
but maybe not because you did so much

00:04:39.979 --> 00:04:42.170 
but maybe not because you did so much
you<00:04:40.979> notice<00:04:41.280> that<00:04:41.310> you<00:04:41.490> did<00:04:41.610> so<00:04:41.820> much<00:04:41.940> hits

00:04:42.170 --> 00:04:42.180 
you notice that you did so much hits

00:04:42.180 --> 00:04:45.950 
you notice that you did so much hits
before<00:04:42.360> so<00:04:42.810> the<00:04:42.900> hits<00:04:43.080> this<00:04:43.470> scaling<00:04:44.960> won't

00:04:45.950 --> 00:04:45.960 
before so the hits this scaling won't

00:04:45.960 --> 00:04:49.129 
before so the hits this scaling won't
kill<00:04:46.200> them<00:04:46.350> and<00:04:46.820> you're<00:04:47.820> gambling<00:04:48.090> man<00:04:48.479> which

00:04:49.129 --> 00:04:49.139 
kill them and you're gambling man which

00:04:49.139 --> 00:04:51.860 
kill them and you're gambling man which

anyway why is that coming up and then

00:05:08.669 --> 00:05:11.060 
anyway why is that coming up and then
after<00:05:09.000> that<00:05:09.120> dash<00:05:09.389> you<00:05:10.290> want<00:05:10.500> to<00:05:10.620> come<00:05:10.770> and<00:05:10.919> go

after that dash you want to come and go
so<00:05:11.280> I'll<00:05:12.000> do<00:05:12.150> sometimes<00:05:12.720> I'll<00:05:12.870> do<00:05:12.990> one<00:05:13.200> and

00:05:13.400 --> 00:05:13.410 
so I'll do sometimes I'll do one and

00:05:13.410 --> 00:05:14.930 
so I'll do sometimes I'll do one and
i'll<00:05:13.620> just<00:05:13.860> ask<00:05:14.010> sometimes<00:05:14.250> I'll<00:05:14.550> do<00:05:14.700> too

00:05:14.930 --> 00:05:14.940 
i'll just ask sometimes I'll do too

00:05:14.940 --> 00:05:19.719 
i'll just ask sometimes I'll do too
sometimes<00:05:15.210> I'll<00:05:15.600> do<00:05:16.280> I'll<00:05:17.280> do<00:05:17.580> this<00:05:17.729> all<00:05:18.000> right

00:05:19.719 --> 00:05:19.729 
sometimes I'll do I'll do this all right

00:05:19.729 --> 00:05:22.190 
sometimes I'll do I'll do this all right
sometimes<00:05:20.729> I'll<00:05:20.880> do<00:05:21.030> one<00:05:21.210> and<00:05:21.539> command<00:05:21.990> us

00:05:22.190 --> 00:05:22.200 
sometimes I'll do one and command us

00:05:22.200 --> 00:05:24.350 
sometimes I'll do one and command us
sometimes<00:05:22.710> I'll<00:05:22.830> do<00:05:23.010> sometimes<00:05:23.820> I'll<00:05:24.000> do<00:05:24.150> too

00:05:24.350 --> 00:05:24.360 
sometimes I'll do sometimes I'll do too

00:05:24.360 --> 00:05:26.240 
sometimes I'll do sometimes I'll do too
and<00:05:24.660> the<00:05:25.169> reason<00:05:25.289> I<00:05:25.470> do<00:05:25.560> this<00:05:25.680> is<00:05:25.830> because<00:05:26.010> it

00:05:26.240 --> 00:05:26.250 
and the reason I do this is because it

00:05:26.250 --> 00:05:31.490 
and the reason I do this is because it
if<00:05:26.960> you<00:05:27.960> do<00:05:29.180> like<00:05:30.180> let's<00:05:30.330> say<00:05:30.479> you<00:05:30.570> do<00:05:30.900> too<00:05:31.169> they

00:05:31.490 --> 00:05:31.500 
if you do like let's say you do too they

00:05:31.500 --> 00:05:32.840 
if you do like let's say you do too they
think<00:05:31.740> you're<00:05:31.860> just<00:05:31.979> doing<00:05:32.190> a<00:05:32.220> combo<00:05:32.550> on<00:05:32.580> them

00:05:32.840 --> 00:05:32.850 
think you're just doing a combo on them

00:05:32.850 --> 00:05:37.340 
think you're just doing a combo on them
but<00:05:33.300> if<00:05:33.450> you<00:05:33.479> just<00:05:33.720> do<00:05:33.870> like<00:05:34.250> this<00:05:35.930> right<00:05:36.930> they

00:05:37.340 --> 00:05:37.350 
but if you just do like this right they

00:05:37.350 --> 00:05:38.810 
but if you just do like this right they
might<00:05:37.530> see<00:05:37.800> it<00:05:37.919> coming<00:05:38.220> and<00:05:38.310> just<00:05:38.460> uppercut

00:05:38.810 --> 00:05:38.820 
might see it coming and just uppercut

00:05:38.820 --> 00:05:41.540 
might see it coming and just uppercut
you<00:05:38.880> but<00:05:39.030> if<00:05:39.300> you<00:05:39.479> do<00:05:40.130> okay<00:05:41.130> that's<00:05:41.400> not

00:05:41.540 --> 00:05:41.550 
you but if you do okay that's not

00:05:41.550 --> 00:05:50.270 
you but if you do okay that's not
nothing<00:05:41.910> but<00:05:42.120> if<00:05:42.210> you<00:05:42.300> do<00:05:48.680> well<00:05:49.680> I<00:05:50.010> don't<00:05:50.190> know

00:05:50.270 --> 00:05:50.280 
nothing but if you do well I don't know

00:05:50.280 --> 00:05:54.800 
nothing but if you do well I don't know
it's<00:05:50.400> happen<00:05:50.639> but<00:05:51.139> if<00:05:52.139> you<00:05:52.410> do<00:05:53.240> too<00:05:54.240> and<00:05:54.630> then

00:05:54.800 --> 00:05:54.810 
it's happen but if you do too and then

00:05:54.810 --> 00:05:55.520 
it's happen but if you do too and then
they're<00:05:54.960> not<00:05:55.080> going<00:05:55.139> to<00:05:55.260> know<00:05:55.320> what's

00:05:55.520 --> 00:05:55.530 
they're not going to know what's

00:05:55.530 --> 00:05:56.840
