00:00:16.170 --> 00:00:24.080
 need ham flour tortillas 

00:00:20.220 --> 00:00:28.070
 simple oaxaca cheese 

00:00:24.080 --> 00:00:30.680
 this manchego of which it is to your liking 

00:00:28.070 --> 00:00:32.880

00:00:30.680 --> 00:00:34.860
 marinated 

00:00:32.880 --> 00:00:37.510
 and avocado 

00:00:34.860 --> 00:00:40.269
 I will do the following 

00:00:37.510 --> 00:00:43.510
 in a comal in a pan in what 

00:00:40.269 --> 00:00:46.329
 you agree they are going to place a 

00:00:43.510 --> 00:00:48.430
 tortilla that like him is already 

00:00:46.329 --> 00:00:50.680
 warming up 

00:00:48.430 --> 00:00:52.680
 but that is not all fire because 

00:00:50.680 --> 00:00:55.700
 the only thing he's going to do is we throw 

00:00:52.680 --> 00:00:58.130
 our flour tortilla 

00:00:55.700 --> 00:01:02.110
 so that it's hotter and 

00:00:58.130 --> 00:01:02.110
 I'm going to place the tortilla 

00:01:03.160 --> 00:01:06.600
 I'm going to put ham 

00:01:14.970 --> 00:01:18.860
 I will put that if I 

00:01:21.070 --> 00:01:23.430
 over 

00:01:30.190 --> 00:01:35.910
 and I'm going to place another two slices of 

00:01:33.880 --> 00:01:35.910
 Ham 

00:01:42.610 --> 00:01:50.250
 and on top of another omelet 

00:01:46.750 --> 00:01:50.250
 already when it has warmed 

00:01:50.980 --> 00:01:58.300
 On one side, the tortilla will give 

00:01:54.630 --> 00:02:01.930
 turns like that until the tortilla is 

00:01:58.300 --> 00:02:03.830
 very hot that this has already been 

00:02:01.930 --> 00:02:06.640
 disrupted 

00:02:03.830 --> 00:02:09.780
 or cast as 

00:02:06.640 --> 00:02:09.780
 we know him 

00:02:10.080 --> 00:02:15.220
 here we can see 

00:02:13.060 --> 00:02:17.910
 how 

00:02:15.220 --> 00:02:20.610
 It's ready 

00:02:17.910 --> 00:02:24.510
 Now I'm going to highlight it and I'm going to 

00:02:20.610 --> 00:02:26.310
 split in half to put avocado 

00:02:24.510 --> 00:02:28.560

00:02:26.310 --> 00:02:32.010
