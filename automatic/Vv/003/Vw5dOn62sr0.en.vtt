00:00:54.889 --> 00:00:54.899 
unless you get them like DIY which you

00:00:54.899 --> 00:00:56.990 
unless you get them like DIY which you
know<00:00:54.960> that's<00:00:55.140> a<00:00:55.230> whole<00:00:55.379> other<00:00:55.440> thing<00:00:55.710> but<00:00:56.579> yeah

00:00:56.990 --> 00:00:57.000 
know that's a whole other thing but yeah

00:00:57.000 --> 00:01:01.490 
know that's a whole other thing but yeah
it<00:00:57.300> comes<00:00:57.600> in<00:00:57.809> this<00:00:58.050> hard<00:00:59.039> plastic<00:00:59.449> box<00:01:00.500> which

00:01:01.490 --> 00:01:01.500 
it comes in this hard plastic box which

00:01:01.500 --> 00:01:23.210 
it comes in this hard plastic box which
is<00:01:01.620> quite<00:01:01.920> interesting<00:01:02.550> let's<00:01:02.850> open<00:01:03.000> it<00:01:03.210> up

00:01:23.210 --> 00:01:23.220 

00:01:23.220 --> 00:01:26.370 

so<00:01:24.220> it<00:01:24.370> looks<00:01:24.520> like<00:01:24.730> this<00:01:24.880> cube<00:01:25.240> comes<00:01:25.630> with<00:01:26.050> an

00:01:26.370 --> 00:01:26.380 
so it looks like this cube comes with an

00:01:26.380 --> 00:01:30.900 
so it looks like this cube comes with an
entire<00:01:28.530> pamphlet<00:01:29.530> that<00:01:29.740> tells<00:01:29.980> you<00:01:30.130> all<00:01:30.340> the

00:01:34.410 --> 00:01:34.420 
olls and all the PLL's which is well

00:01:34.420 --> 00:01:39.260 
olls and all the PLL's which is well
very<00:01:35.430> interesting<00:01:36.430> it<00:01:37.270> also<00:01:37.420> has<00:01:37.750> a<00:01:38.020> ton<00:01:38.410> of

C fop oh LOL p ll from the gans 356 I
don't<00:01:58.000> know<00:01:58.090> that<00:01:58.270> that's<00:01:58.450> necessary<00:01:59.080> because

00:01:59.340 --> 00:01:59.350 
don't know that that's necessary because

00:01:59.350 --> 00:02:01.710 
don't know that that's necessary because
anybody<00:01:59.740> spending<00:02:00.310> 20<00:02:00.610> bucks<00:02:00.790> on<00:02:00.940> a<00:02:01.000> 3x3

00:02:01.710 --> 00:02:01.720 
anybody spending 20 bucks on a 3x3

00:02:01.720 --> 00:02:04.920 
anybody spending 20 bucks on a 3x3
probably<00:02:02.140> already<00:02:02.290> knows<00:02:03.210> where<00:02:04.210> to<00:02:04.240> get<00:02:04.720> that

00:02:04.920 --> 00:02:04.930 
probably already knows where to get that

00:02:04.930 --> 00:02:07.590 
probably already knows where to get that
information<00:02:05.229> but<00:02:05.890> you<00:02:06.070> know<00:02:06.390> it's<00:02:07.390> cool

00:02:07.590 --> 00:02:07.600 
information but you know it's cool

00:02:07.600 --> 00:02:10.740 
information but you know it's cool
nonetheless<00:02:08.580> so<00:02:09.580> now<00:02:09.700> let's<00:02:09.940> get<00:02:10.119> into<00:02:10.179> the

00:02:10.740 --> 00:02:10.750 
nonetheless so now let's get into the

00:02:10.750 --> 00:02:30.280 
nonetheless so now let's get into the
cube<00:02:11.170> itself

00:02:30.280 --> 00:02:30.290 

00:02:30.290 --> 00:02:32.470 

so<00:02:30.920> it<00:02:31.040> looks<00:02:31.189> like<00:02:31.280> this<00:02:31.519> cube<00:02:31.879> does<00:02:32.120> come

00:02:32.470 --> 00:02:32.480 
so it looks like this cube does come

00:02:32.480 --> 00:02:36.670 
so it looks like this cube does come
wrapped<00:02:32.780> in<00:02:32.989> plastic<00:02:33.610> which<00:02:34.610> seems<00:02:35.030> to<00:02:35.150> be<00:02:35.680> a

00:02:36.670 --> 00:02:36.680 
wrapped in plastic which seems to be a

00:02:36.680 --> 00:02:40.000 
wrapped in plastic which seems to be a
thing<00:02:37.519> nowadays<00:02:37.870> my<00:02:38.870> mo<00:02:39.049> you<00:02:39.110> koala<00:02:39.500> I<00:02:39.650> got<00:02:39.980> a

00:02:40.000 --> 00:02:40.010 
thing nowadays my mo you koala I got a

00:02:40.010 --> 00:02:42.130 
thing nowadays my mo you koala I got a
few<00:02:40.250> days<00:02:40.370> ago<00:02:40.579> came<00:02:41.000> wrapped<00:02:41.209> in<00:02:41.360> plastic<00:02:41.599> so

00:02:42.130 --> 00:02:42.140 
few days ago came wrapped in plastic so

00:02:42.140 --> 00:02:55.559 
few days ago came wrapped in plastic so
I<00:02:42.349> guess<00:02:43.220> it's<00:02:43.430> a<00:02:43.579> trend<00:02:52.060> so<00:02:53.060> here<00:02:53.659> is<00:02:53.810> the<00:02:54.049> cube

00:02:55.559 --> 00:02:55.569 
I guess it's a trend so here is the cube

00:02:55.569 --> 00:02:59.410 
I guess it's a trend so here is the cube
no<00:02:56.569> stickers<00:02:57.019> on<00:02:57.200> it<00:02:57.349> right<00:02:57.530> now<00:02:57.560> but<00:02:58.340> uh<00:02:58.420> let's

00:02:59.410 --> 00:02:59.420 
no stickers on it right now but uh let's

00:02:59.420 --> 00:03:35.559 
no stickers on it right now but uh let's
do<00:02:59.599> some<00:02:59.810> first<00:03:00.079> turns<00:03:34.239> Wow

00:03:35.559 --> 00:03:35.569 
do some first turns Wow

00:03:35.569 --> 00:03:40.449 
do some first turns Wow
so<00:03:35.780> this<00:03:36.290> this<00:03:37.129> is<00:03:37.340> interesting<00:03:39.040> the<00:03:40.040> corner

00:03:40.449 --> 00:03:40.459 
so this this is interesting the corner

00:03:40.459 --> 00:03:43.869 
so this this is interesting the corner
cutting<00:03:40.699> on<00:03:41.030> this<00:03:41.150> thing<00:03:41.419> is<00:03:41.919> insane<00:03:42.919> you<00:03:43.370> can

00:03:43.869 --> 00:03:43.879 
cutting on this thing is insane you can

00:03:43.879 --> 00:03:48.689 
cutting on this thing is insane you can
do<00:03:44.060> two<00:03:44.599> cubies<00:03:45.400> regular<00:03:46.400> and<00:03:46.780> 1qb<00:03:47.780> reverse

00:03:48.689 --> 00:03:48.699 
do two cubies regular and 1qb reverse

00:03:48.699 --> 00:03:51.699 
do two cubies regular and 1qb reverse
with<00:03:49.699> like<00:03:50.000> no<00:03:50.299> effort<00:03:50.900> at<00:03:51.049> all

00:03:51.699 --> 00:03:51.709 
with like no effort at all

00:03:51.709 --> 00:03:54.460 
with like no effort at all
I<00:03:51.739> think<00:03:52.639> these<00:03:52.790> squared<00:03:53.299> off<00:03:53.510> corners<00:03:54.139> are

00:03:54.460 --> 00:03:54.470 
I think these squared off corners are

00:03:54.470 --> 00:03:56.680 
I think these squared off corners are
gonna<00:03:54.650> help<00:03:55.010> prevent<00:03:55.639> corner<00:03:56.120> twists<00:03:56.510> so

00:03:56.680 --> 00:03:56.690 
gonna help prevent corner twists so

00:03:56.690 --> 00:04:00.069 
gonna help prevent corner twists so
that's<00:03:56.930> great<00:03:57.410> and<00:03:57.790> it's<00:03:58.790> just<00:03:59.000> a<00:03:59.150> very<00:03:59.569> fast

00:04:00.069 --> 00:04:00.079 
that's great and it's just a very fast

00:04:00.079 --> 00:04:03.520 
that's great and it's just a very fast
cube<00:04:00.650> em<00:04:01.010> slices<00:04:01.879> are<00:04:02.209> insane

00:04:03.520 --> 00:04:03.530 
cube em slices are insane

00:04:03.530 --> 00:04:06.819 
cube em slices are insane
so<00:04:04.099> obviously<00:04:04.669> it's<00:04:05.060> still<00:04:05.419> unstick<00:04:06.349> 'red<00:04:06.530> so

00:04:06.819 --> 00:04:06.829 
so obviously it's still unstick 'red so

00:04:06.829 --> 00:04:09.099 
so obviously it's still unstick 'red so
I'm<00:04:06.949> gonna<00:04:07.069> have<00:04:07.310> to<00:04:07.340> sticker<00:04:08.030> it<00:04:08.299> with<00:04:08.810> my

00:04:09.099 --> 00:04:09.109 
I'm gonna have to sticker it with my

00:04:09.109 --> 00:04:12.250 
I'm gonna have to sticker it with my
half<00:04:09.410> brights<00:04:09.739> from<00:04:10.400> the<00:04:10.639> cubicle<00:04:11.139> in<00:04:12.139> a

00:04:12.250 --> 00:04:12.260 
half brights from the cubicle in a

00:04:12.260 --> 00:04:16.240 
half brights from the cubicle in a
second<00:04:12.709> here<00:04:13.099> and<00:04:14.319> yeah<00:04:15.319> so<00:04:15.680> far<00:04:15.889> it's<00:04:16.159> really

00:04:16.240 --> 00:04:16.250 
second here and yeah so far it's really

00:04:16.250 --> 00:04:17.770 
second here and yeah so far it's really
good<00:04:16.609> I'm<00:04:16.789> not<00:04:16.820> sure<00:04:17.120> if<00:04:17.239> it's<00:04:17.359> gonna<00:04:17.539> need

00:04:17.770 --> 00:04:17.780 
good I'm not sure if it's gonna need

00:04:17.780 --> 00:04:19.870 
good I'm not sure if it's gonna need
much<00:04:18.019> looping<00:04:18.440> or<00:04:18.590> tensioning<00:04:19.130> I<00:04:19.310> do<00:04:19.579> have

00:04:19.870 --> 00:04:19.880 
much looping or tensioning I do have

00:04:19.880 --> 00:04:21.250 
much looping or tensioning I do have
that<00:04:20.000> tensioning<00:04:20.539> tool<00:04:20.570> that<00:04:20.900> comes<00:04:21.109> with

00:04:21.250 --> 00:04:21.260 
that tensioning tool that comes with

00:04:21.260 --> 00:04:23.680 
that tensioning tool that comes with
which<00:04:21.620> is<00:04:21.799> quite<00:04:22.610> interesting<00:04:23.150> because<00:04:23.330> as

00:04:23.680 --> 00:04:23.690 
which is quite interesting because as

00:04:23.690 --> 00:04:27.100 
which is quite interesting because as
you<00:04:23.870> can<00:04:24.020> see<00:04:24.080> the<00:04:24.770> core<00:04:25.220> mechanism<00:04:26.110> uses

00:04:27.100 --> 00:04:27.110 
you can see the core mechanism uses

00:04:27.110 --> 00:04:31.000 
you can see the core mechanism uses
these<00:04:27.530> plastic<00:04:28.190> washers<00:04:28.820> on<00:04:29.240> top<00:04:29.750> of<00:04:29.990> like<00:04:30.830> a

00:04:31.000 --> 00:04:31.010 
these plastic washers on top of like a

00:04:31.010 --> 00:04:33.399 
these plastic washers on top of like a
built<00:04:31.520> in<00:04:31.639> screw<00:04:32.389> I<00:04:32.419> guess<00:04:32.840> and<00:04:33.169> then<00:04:33.229> there's

00:04:33.399 --> 00:04:33.409 
built in screw I guess and then there's

00:04:33.409 --> 00:04:36.399 
built in screw I guess and then there's
a<00:04:33.470> spring<00:04:33.919> underneath<00:04:34.520> it<00:04:34.789> so<00:04:35.479> much<00:04:35.840> different

00:04:36.399 --> 00:04:36.409 
a spring underneath it so much different

00:04:36.409 --> 00:04:39.550 
a spring underneath it so much different
than<00:04:36.650> a<00:04:37.490> lot<00:04:37.789> of<00:04:37.970> other<00:04:38.240> cubes<00:04:39.139> that<00:04:39.380> we've

00:04:39.550 --> 00:04:39.560 
than a lot of other cubes that we've

00:04:39.560 --> 00:04:43.209 
than a lot of other cubes that we've
seen<00:04:39.950> on<00:04:40.280> the<00:04:40.490> market<00:04:40.880> but<00:04:41.840> it<00:04:42.289> has<00:04:42.919> been

00:04:43.209 --> 00:04:43.219 
seen on the market but it has been

00:04:43.219 --> 00:04:43.840 
seen on the market but it has been
apparent

00:04:43.840 --> 00:04:43.850 
apparent

00:04:43.850 --> 00:04:46.120 
apparent
pretty<00:04:44.840> consistent<00:04:45.470> throughout<00:04:45.590> the<00:04:45.860> ganz

00:04:46.120 --> 00:04:46.130 
pretty consistent throughout the ganz

00:04:46.130 --> 00:04:48.670 
pretty consistent throughout the ganz
puzzle<00:04:46.730> cubes<00:04:47.090> so<00:04:47.900> yeah<00:04:48.020> we'll<00:04:48.200> see<00:04:48.380> how<00:04:48.500> that

00:04:48.670 --> 00:04:48.680 
puzzle cubes so yeah we'll see how that

00:04:48.680 --> 00:04:50.590 
puzzle cubes so yeah we'll see how that
works<00:04:48.920> out<00:04:49.100> but<00:04:49.160> I'm<00:04:49.820> not<00:04:49.970> sure<00:04:50.330> I'll<00:04:50.480> even

00:04:50.590 --> 00:04:50.600 
works out but I'm not sure I'll even

00:04:50.600 --> 00:04:54.130 
works out but I'm not sure I'll even
need<00:04:50.990> to<00:04:51.200> tension<00:04:51.590> this<00:04:51.740> much<00:04:52.660> because<00:04:53.660> it's

00:04:54.130 --> 00:04:54.140 
need to tension this much because it's

00:04:54.140 --> 00:04:57.190 
need to tension this much because it's
already<00:04:54.410> great<00:04:55.220> out<00:04:55.490> of<00:04:55.670> the<00:04:55.760> box<00:04:56.050> so<00:04:57.050> yeah

00:04:57.190 --> 00:04:57.200 
already great out of the box so yeah

00:04:57.200 --> 00:04:59.440 
already great out of the box so yeah
that's<00:04:57.440> about<00:04:57.530> it<00:04:57.860> for<00:04:58.070> my<00:04:58.220> unboxing<00:04:58.520> of<00:04:59.000> the

00:04:59.440 --> 00:04:59.450
