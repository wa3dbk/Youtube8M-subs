who<00:00:22.199> are<00:00:22.350> sure<00:00:22.949> what<00:00:23.220> a<00:00:23.250> macro<00:00:23.730> is

00:00:24.400 --> 00:00:24.410 
who are sure what a macro is

00:00:24.410 --> 00:00:27.980

carbohydrates and you want to

00:00:30.060 --> 00:00:32.840 
carbohydrates and you want to
consistently<00:00:30.750> make<00:00:31.320> changes<00:00:31.800> so<00:00:32.640> that<00:00:32.669> your

00:01:03.110 --> 00:01:03.120 
supplementation for women and what is

00:01:03.120 --> 00:01:05.620 
supplementation for women and what is
the<00:01:03.239> best<00:01:03.449> split<00:01:03.840> for<00:01:04.140> building<00:01:04.439> muscle

00:01:05.620 --> 00:01:05.630 
the best split for building muscle

00:01:05.630 --> 00:01:08.660 
the best split for building muscle
there's<00:01:06.630> absolutely<00:01:07.260> no<00:01:07.619> harm<00:01:08.130> in<00:01:08.400> taking

00:01:08.660 --> 00:01:08.670 
there's absolutely no harm in taking

00:01:08.670 --> 00:01:11.289 
there's absolutely no harm in taking
creatine<00:01:09.060> if<00:01:09.450> you're<00:01:09.600> a<00:01:09.630> woman<00:01:09.810> or<00:01:10.380> a<00:01:10.439> man

00:01:11.289 --> 00:01:11.299 
creatine if you're a woman or a man

00:01:11.299 --> 00:01:13.490 
creatine if you're a woman or a man
creatine<00:01:12.299> is<00:01:12.540> actually<00:01:12.810> founded<00:01:13.140> a<00:01:13.229> lot<00:01:13.380> of

00:01:13.490 --> 00:01:13.500 
creatine is actually founded a lot of

00:01:13.500 --> 00:01:15.520 
creatine is actually founded a lot of
meats<00:01:13.680> that<00:01:13.799> you<00:01:13.950> need<00:01:14.159> especially<00:01:14.580> red<00:01:15.060> meats

00:01:15.520 --> 00:01:15.530 
meats that you need especially red meats

00:01:15.530 --> 00:01:19.730 
meats that you need especially red meats
but<00:01:16.530> if<00:01:16.830> you<00:01:17.159> take<00:01:17.430> about<00:01:17.759> 5<00:01:18.390> grams<00:01:18.750> per<00:01:19.320> day<00:01:19.470> I

00:01:19.730 --> 00:01:19.740 
but if you take about 5 grams per day I

00:01:19.740 --> 00:01:21.170 
but if you take about 5 grams per day I
mean<00:01:19.979> there's<00:01:20.159> no<00:01:20.310> need<00:01:20.520> to<00:01:20.549> really<00:01:20.939> load

00:01:21.170 --> 00:01:21.180 
mean there's no need to really load

00:01:21.180 --> 00:01:25.399 
mean there's no need to really load
creatine<00:01:22.880> it's<00:01:23.880> shown<00:01:24.150> to<00:01:24.450> help<00:01:24.780> with<00:01:25.110> muscle

00:01:25.399 --> 00:01:25.409 
creatine it's shown to help with muscle

00:01:25.409 --> 00:01:28.399 
creatine it's shown to help with muscle
stamina<00:01:26.070> muscle<00:01:26.460> strength<00:01:26.960> which<00:01:27.960> means<00:01:28.200> you

00:01:28.399 --> 00:01:28.409 
stamina muscle strength which means you

00:01:28.409 --> 00:01:30.380 
stamina muscle strength which means you
could<00:01:28.530> probably<00:01:28.770> lift<00:01:29.220> a<00:01:29.460> little<00:01:29.939> bit<00:01:30.150> more

00:01:30.380 --> 00:01:30.390 
could probably lift a little bit more

00:01:30.390 --> 00:01:33.050 
could probably lift a little bit more
and<00:01:30.720> push<00:01:31.710> a<00:01:31.890> little<00:01:31.920> bit<00:01:32.340> harder<00:01:32.700> and<00:01:32.939> go<00:01:33.030> a

00:01:33.050 --> 00:01:33.060 
and push a little bit harder and go a

00:01:33.060 --> 00:01:35.179 
and push a little bit harder and go a
little<00:01:33.299> bit<00:01:33.479> farther<00:01:33.840> and<00:01:34.140> longer<00:01:34.200> than<00:01:35.009> you

00:01:35.179 --> 00:01:35.189 
little bit farther and longer than you

00:01:35.189 --> 00:01:37.460 
little bit farther and longer than you
would<00:01:35.400> without<00:01:35.729> it<00:01:35.909> which<00:01:36.450> can<00:01:36.780> help<00:01:37.170> with

00:01:37.460 --> 00:01:37.470 
would without it which can help with

00:01:37.470 --> 00:01:40.310 
would without it which can help with
strength<00:01:38.400> and<00:01:38.670> power<00:01:39.000> and<00:01:39.150> increase<00:01:40.020> muscle

00:01:40.310 --> 00:01:40.320 
strength and power and increase muscle

00:01:40.320 --> 00:01:42.950 
strength and power and increase muscle
if<00:01:40.740> that's<00:01:41.430> what<00:01:41.610> your<00:01:41.729> goal<00:01:41.909> is<00:01:41.939> so<00:01:42.390> yeah<00:01:42.930> I

00:01:42.950 --> 00:01:42.960 
if that's what your goal is so yeah I

00:01:42.960 --> 00:01:45.499 
if that's what your goal is so yeah I
mean<00:01:43.140> 5<00:01:43.470> grams<00:01:43.740> a<00:01:43.890> day<00:01:43.920> is<00:01:44.340> what<00:01:45.270> I<00:01:45.299> would

00:01:45.499 --> 00:01:45.509 
mean 5 grams a day is what I would

00:01:45.509 --> 00:01:47.719 
mean 5 grams a day is what I would
recommend<00:01:45.600> just<00:01:46.530> a<00:01:46.619> basic<00:01:47.070> creatine

00:01:47.719 --> 00:01:47.729 
recommend just a basic creatine

00:01:47.729 --> 00:01:48.969 
recommend just a basic creatine
monohydrate<00:01:47.880> you<00:01:48.450> don't<00:01:48.600> need<00:01:48.720> anything

00:01:48.969 --> 00:01:48.979 
monohydrate you don't need anything

00:01:48.979 --> 00:01:53.300 
monohydrate you don't need anything
crazy<00:01:49.979> and<00:01:50.509> start<00:01:51.509> with<00:01:51.630> that<00:01:51.750> as<00:01:52.020> far<00:01:52.950> as<00:01:52.979> the

00:01:53.300 --> 00:01:53.310 
crazy and start with that as far as the

00:01:53.310 --> 00:01:56.050 
crazy and start with that as far as the
best<00:01:53.610> split<00:01:53.939> for<00:01:54.180> building<00:01:54.509> muscle

00:01:56.050 --> 00:01:56.060 
best split for building muscle

00:01:56.060 --> 00:01:58.969 
best split for building muscle
definitely<00:01:57.060> increase<00:01:57.540> the<00:01:57.719> volume<00:01:57.979> that

00:01:58.969 --> 00:01:58.979 
definitely increase the volume that

00:01:58.979 --> 00:02:00.889 
definitely increase the volume that
you're<00:01:59.189> training<00:01:59.610> per<00:01:59.820> muscle<00:02:00.000> group<00:02:00.390> so<00:02:00.689> the

00:02:00.889 --> 00:02:00.899 
you're training per muscle group so the

00:02:00.899 --> 00:02:02.780 
you're training per muscle group so the
best<00:02:01.110> way<00:02:01.290> to<00:02:01.350> do<00:02:01.500> that<00:02:01.530> is<00:02:01.710> to<00:02:01.920> split<00:02:02.280> up<00:02:02.549> your

00:02:02.780 --> 00:02:02.790 
best way to do that is to split up your

00:02:02.790 --> 00:02:06.020 
best way to do that is to split up your
body<00:02:03.210> parts<00:02:03.659> into<00:02:03.869> single<00:02:04.610> single<00:02:05.610> body<00:02:05.729> part

00:02:06.020 --> 00:02:06.030 
body parts into single single body part

00:02:06.030 --> 00:02:06.520 
body parts into single single body part

00:04:41.460 --> 00:04:41.470 
the last question I have is how long

00:04:41.470 --> 00:04:43.920 
the last question I have is how long
should<00:04:41.770> you<00:04:41.890> hold<00:04:42.160> static<00:04:42.670> stretches<00:04:43.240> for<00:04:43.870> the

00:04:43.920 --> 00:04:43.930 
should you hold static stretches for the

00:04:43.930 --> 00:04:46.110 
should you hold static stretches for the
best<00:04:44.170> benefit<00:04:44.680> I<00:04:44.860> hear<00:04:45.430> many<00:04:45.670> different

00:04:46.110 --> 00:04:46.120 
best benefit I hear many different

00:04:46.120 --> 00:04:51.030 
best benefit I hear many different
amounts<00:04:46.480> of<00:04:46.480> time<00:04:46.630> I<00:04:48.930> i<00:04:49.930> would<00:04:50.440> say<00:04:50.620> holding

00:04:51.030 --> 00:04:51.040 
amounts of time I i would say holding

00:04:51.040 --> 00:04:52.740 
amounts of time I i would say holding
each<00:04:51.190> stretch<00:04:51.490> about<00:04:51.790> 30<00:04:52.060> seconds<00:04:52.540> is

00:04:52.740 --> 00:04:52.750 
each stretch about 30 seconds is

00:04:52.750 --> 00:04:54.900 
each stretch about 30 seconds is
sufficient<00:04:53.500> you<00:04:53.890> can<00:04:54.040> hold<00:04:54.220> it<00:04:54.370> longer<00:04:54.520> if<00:04:54.700> you

00:04:54.900 --> 00:04:54.910 
sufficient you can hold it longer if you

00:04:54.910 --> 00:04:56.670 
sufficient you can hold it longer if you
wanted<00:04:55.210> to<00:04:55.360> I<00:04:55.390> know<00:04:55.600> when<00:04:55.870> I<00:04:55.900> was<00:04:56.050> a<00:04:56.110> gymnast<00:04:56.530> we

00:04:56.670 --> 00:04:56.680 
wanted to I know when I was a gymnast we

00:04:56.680 --> 00:04:58.200 
wanted to I know when I was a gymnast we
would<00:04:56.800> hold<00:04:57.040> the<00:04:57.100> splits<00:04:57.490> for<00:04:57.700> one<00:04:58.000> to<00:04:58.150> two

00:04:58.200 --> 00:04:58.210 
would hold the splits for one to two

00:04:58.210 --> 00:05:02.310 
would hold the splits for one to two
minutes<00:04:58.360> at<00:04:58.930> a<00:04:58.990> time<00:04:59.950> and<00:05:00.900> sometimes<00:05:01.900> even

00:05:02.310 --> 00:05:02.320 
minutes at a time and sometimes even

00:05:02.320 --> 00:05:04.920 
minutes at a time and sometimes even
longer<00:05:02.440> but<00:05:03.280> if<00:05:03.490> if<00:05:03.790> you're<00:05:04.120> doing<00:05:04.420> less<00:05:04.720> than

longer but if if you're doing less than

longer but if if you're doing less than
20<00:05:05.260> seconds<00:05:05.680> I<00:05:05.920> don't<00:05:06.100> think<00:05:06.310> that<00:05:06.430> you're
