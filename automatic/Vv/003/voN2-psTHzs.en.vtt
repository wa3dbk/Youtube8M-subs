gaming<00:00:32.460> without<00:00:32.700> a<00:00:32.940> space<00:00:38.480> I'm<00:00:39.480> creative<00:00:40.790> and

00:00:43.330 --> 00:00:43.340 
gaming without a space I'm creative and

00:00:43.340 --> 00:00:54.850 
gaming without a space I'm creative and
this<00:00:44.340> world<00:00:46.190> is<00:00:47.190> basically<00:00:50.989> sort<00:00:51.989> of<00:00:52.879> in<00:00:53.879> a

00:00:54.850 --> 00:00:54.860 
this world is basically sort of in a

00:00:54.860 --> 00:01:00.799 
this world is basically sort of in a
frozen<00:00:55.860> snow<00:00:56.699> biome<00:00:56.969> and<00:00:58.910> I<00:00:59.910> just<00:01:00.149> fly<00:01:00.390> up<00:01:00.420> here

00:01:00.799 --> 00:01:00.809 
frozen snow biome and I just fly up here

00:01:00.809 --> 00:01:03.049 
frozen snow biome and I just fly up here
it's<00:01:01.440> nothing<00:01:01.739> special<00:01:02.070> just<00:01:02.280> a<00:01:02.460> big<00:01:02.640> snowy

00:01:03.049 --> 00:01:03.059 
it's nothing special just a big snowy

00:01:03.059 --> 00:01:05.560 
it's nothing special just a big snowy
forest<00:01:03.510> but<00:01:03.690> then<00:01:03.899> that's<00:01:04.890> the<00:01:05.070> wrong<00:01:05.189> way

00:01:05.560 --> 00:01:05.570 
forest but then that's the wrong way

00:01:05.570 --> 00:01:13.179 
forest but then that's the wrong way
does<00:01:06.570> it<00:01:06.720> there<00:01:09.890> there<00:01:10.890> we<00:01:11.010> go<00:01:11.159> there<00:01:11.580> is<00:01:11.610> this

00:01:13.179 --> 00:01:13.189 
does it there there we go there is this

00:01:13.189 --> 00:01:18.560 
does it there there we go there is this
really<00:01:14.189> nice-looking<00:01:15.560> frozen<00:01:16.560> river<00:01:17.570> which

00:01:18.560 --> 00:01:18.570 
really nice-looking frozen river which

00:01:18.570 --> 00:01:19.999 
really nice-looking frozen river which
sort<00:01:18.780> of<00:01:18.810> comes<00:01:19.020> around<00:01:19.259> here<00:01:19.409> and<00:01:19.500> this<00:01:19.770> I'm

00:01:19.999 --> 00:01:20.009 
sort of comes around here and this I'm

00:01:20.009 --> 00:01:23.710 
sort of comes around here and this I'm
guessing<00:01:20.610> will<00:01:20.820> freeze<00:01:21.570> over<00:01:21.750> when<00:01:22.140> it<00:01:22.259> snows

00:01:23.710 --> 00:01:23.720 
guessing will freeze over when it snows

00:01:23.720 --> 00:01:26.510 
guessing will freeze over when it snows
but<00:01:24.720> at<00:01:24.930> the<00:01:25.049> moment<00:01:25.229> it<00:01:25.439> looks<00:01:25.590> really<00:01:26.310> cool

00:01:26.510 --> 00:01:26.520 
but at the moment it looks really cool

00:01:26.520 --> 00:01:30.260 
but at the moment it looks really cool
and<00:01:26.850> you<00:01:27.840> do<00:01:27.990> a<00:01:28.020> cool<00:01:28.729> no<00:01:29.729> Game<00:01:30.090> of<00:01:30.119> Thrones

00:01:30.260 --> 00:01:30.270 
and you do a cool no Game of Thrones

00:01:30.270 --> 00:01:38.300 
and you do a cool no Game of Thrones
themed<00:01:32.600> build<00:01:33.600> as<00:01:33.960> winter<00:01:34.590> is<00:01:34.920> coming<00:01:35.960> or<00:01:37.310> I
