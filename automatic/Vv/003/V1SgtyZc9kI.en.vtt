00:00:04.920 --> 00:00:11.070
 now hello friends instituted i am site 17 

00:00:07.890 --> 00:00:13.920
 I'm going to teach them to eat change the 

00:00:11.070 --> 00:00:16.630
 lock screen of your system 

00:00:13.920 --> 00:00:20.919
 operative windows 8 

00:00:16.630 --> 00:00:23.150
 as you can see many people have 

00:00:20.919 --> 00:00:25.760
 tried 

00:00:23.150 --> 00:00:28.160
 you can say that lend more I use 

00:00:25.760 --> 00:00:33.140
 done for example putting pictures of 

00:00:28.160 --> 00:00:35.440
 background that after the screen because the 

00:00:33.140 --> 00:00:40.109
 lock screen 

00:00:35.440 --> 00:00:40.109
 I think you are 

00:00:43.750 --> 00:00:47.530
 in these programs 

00:00:48.320 --> 00:00:57.200
 and well let's personalization change 

00:00:52.560 --> 00:00:57.200
 and as you can see I have a handle 

00:00:58.070 --> 00:01:04.129
 it does not matter one but good you 

00:01:01.460 --> 00:01:06.560
 they will have a 

00:01:04.129 --> 00:01:10.340
 a few more are not many but if 

00:01:06.560 --> 00:01:14.259
 they are different images because or good 

00:01:10.340 --> 00:01:14.259
 the first thing to do is start 

00:01:15.120 --> 00:01:19.080
 go to ping as I do not have it in 

00:01:17.640 --> 00:01:21.500
 sabers 

00:01:19.080 --> 00:01:21.500
 the 

00:01:22.070 --> 00:01:24.880
 in the bar 

00:01:30.740 --> 00:01:36.990
 We wait for you to open 1st 

00:01:33.610 --> 00:01:36.990
 I say good 

00:01:39.350 --> 00:01:42.340
 so is 

00:01:42.990 --> 00:01:49.490
 rob have changed of fair mind 

00:01:45.990 --> 00:01:51.290
 but they are walking outside 

00:01:49.490 --> 00:01:54.049
 well that means the people what 

00:01:51.290 --> 00:01:56.090
 we're going to click right and we should be 

00:01:54.049 --> 00:01:58.540
 here in establish as blockade of 

00:01:56.090 --> 00:01:58.540
 screen 

00:01:59.530 --> 00:02:04.100
 both will go 

00:02:02.200 --> 00:02:07.450
 with duration 

00:02:04.100 --> 00:02:07.450
 and as you can see, I have two more 

00:02:09.039 --> 00:02:11.670
 when it's worth 

00:02:14.110 --> 00:02:19.819
 the 

00:02:15.480 --> 00:02:19.819
 I think the contribution sounds 

00:02:21.420 --> 00:02:27.700
 see the export 

00:02:23.900 --> 00:02:27.700
 but if you think sense 

00:02:28.140 --> 00:02:32.940
 today on screens that you do not 

00:02:30.840 --> 00:02:36.450
 I was paying attention 

00:02:32.940 --> 00:02:38.220
 that is, we must right click and 

00:02:36.450 --> 00:02:40.310
 it puts set as on screen 

00:02:38.220 --> 00:02:40.310
 blocking 

00:02:46.400 --> 00:02:55.550
 and this is very active 

00:02:53.150 --> 00:02:58.030
 welcome to this exam 

00:02:55.550 --> 00:03:00.690

00:02:58.030 --> 00:03:00.690
 good 

00:03:01.110 --> 00:03:05.660
 I think those are all before our 

00:03:03.150 --> 00:03:05.660
 false 

00:03:07.780 --> 00:03:10.890
 these people only 

00:03:18.540 --> 00:03:23.310
 some will be useful to change the 

00:03:20.760 --> 00:03:26.340
 background as is this truth with the 

00:03:23.310 --> 00:03:28.140
 little keyboard arrows let's say the 

00:03:26.340 --> 00:03:30.769
 turn that is up forwards and 

00:03:28.140 --> 00:03:30.769
 then back 

00:03:30.790 --> 00:03:36.520
 OK 

00:03:32.410 --> 00:03:38.710
 they are not all good I will teach 

00:03:36.520 --> 00:03:43.110

00:03:38.710 --> 00:03:43.110
 of these are these 3 

00:03:50.650 --> 00:03:56.730
 this has been all for today 

00:03:53.730 --> 00:03:56.730
