00:00:39.319 --> 00:00:39.329 
that this drawing hall was actually

00:00:39.329 --> 00:00:41.479 
that this drawing hall was actually
underneath<00:00:39.809> like<00:00:40.170> an<00:00:40.320> ocean<00:00:40.620> and<00:00:41.160> I<00:00:41.219> was<00:00:41.340> like

00:00:41.479 --> 00:00:41.489 
underneath like an ocean and I was like

00:00:41.489 --> 00:00:44.240 
underneath like an ocean and I was like
hmm<00:00:42.030> that<00:00:42.809> I<00:00:42.840> would<00:00:43.110> never<00:00:43.290> I<00:00:43.410> find<00:00:43.710> that<00:00:43.860> if<00:00:44.070> I

00:00:44.240 --> 00:00:44.250 
hmm that I would never I find that if I

00:00:44.250 --> 00:00:46.310 
hmm that I would never I find that if I
hadn't<00:00:44.520> been<00:00:44.610> in<00:00:44.700> the<00:00:44.760> cave<00:00:44.940> system<00:00:45.300> so<00:00:46.020> it's

00:00:46.310 --> 00:00:46.320 
hadn't been in the cave system so it's

00:00:46.320 --> 00:00:49.069 
hadn't been in the cave system so it's
kinda<00:00:46.530> like<00:00:46.800> unfair<00:00:47.610> how<00:00:48.180> difficult<00:00:48.690> is<00:00:48.780> tying

00:00:49.069 --> 00:00:49.079 
kinda like unfair how difficult is tying

00:00:49.079 --> 00:00:52.459 
kinda like unfair how difficult is tying
them<00:00:49.200> um<00:00:49.670> I<00:00:50.670> think<00:00:51.120> I<00:00:51.329> just<00:00:51.449> flip<00:00:51.660> asta<00:00:51.989> out

00:00:52.459 --> 00:00:52.469 
them um I think I just flip asta out

00:00:52.469 --> 00:00:53.900 
them um I think I just flip asta out
there<00:00:52.680> there's<00:00:53.190> another<00:00:53.430> one<00:00:53.610> that<00:00:53.640> isn't

00:00:53.900 --> 00:00:53.910 
there there's another one that isn't

00:00:53.910 --> 00:00:56.869 
there there's another one that isn't
like<00:00:54.210> completely<00:00:55.110> nest<00:00:55.350> up<00:00:55.500> but<00:00:56.219> there's<00:00:56.789> only

00:00:56.869 --> 00:00:56.879 
like completely nest up but there's only

00:00:56.879 --> 00:00:59.990 
like completely nest up but there's only
one<00:00:57.000> of<00:00:57.210> these<00:00:57.300> pair<00:00:57.539> worlds<00:00:57.840> and<00:00:58.760> main<00:00:59.760> /<00:00:59.940> a

00:00:59.990 --> 00:01:00.000 
one of these pair worlds and main / a

00:01:00.000 --> 00:01:04.759 
one of these pair worlds and main / a
fish<00:01:00.260> Worilds<00:01:01.260> thing<00:01:01.500> and<00:01:02.329> I<00:01:03.589> don't<00:01:04.589> know<00:01:04.650> how

00:01:04.759 --> 00:01:04.769 
fish Worilds thing and I don't know how

00:01:04.769 --> 00:01:06.020 
fish Worilds thing and I don't know how
you<00:01:04.830> can<00:01:05.040> find<00:01:05.250> them<00:01:05.369> really<00:01:05.519> i<00:01:05.790> think<00:01:05.850> it's

00:01:06.020 --> 00:01:06.030 
you can find them really i think it's

00:01:06.030 --> 00:01:08.840 
you can find them really i think it's
just<00:01:06.090> exploring<00:01:06.840> stuff<00:01:07.229> but<00:01:07.650> it's<00:01:08.520> completely

00:01:08.840 --> 00:01:08.850 
just exploring stuff but it's completely

00:01:08.850 --> 00:01:11.899 
just exploring stuff but it's completely
randomly<00:01:09.570> spawn<00:01:10.189> it<00:01:11.189> can<00:01:11.430> look<00:01:11.580> kind<00:01:11.790> of

00:01:11.899 --> 00:01:11.909 
randomly spawn it can look kind of

00:01:11.909 --> 00:01:14.660 
randomly spawn it can look kind of
messed<00:01:12.479> up<00:01:12.750> and<00:01:12.960> broken<00:01:13.380> apart<00:01:13.799> and<00:01:13.979> stuff<00:01:14.130> but

00:01:14.660 --> 00:01:14.670 
messed up and broken apart and stuff but

00:01:14.670 --> 00:01:15.800 
messed up and broken apart and stuff but
i<00:01:14.909> think<00:01:15.090> it<00:01:15.180> looks<00:01:15.299> way<00:01:15.360> cool<00:01:15.540> because<00:01:15.630> there

00:01:15.800 --> 00:01:15.810 
i think it looks way cool because there

00:01:15.810 --> 00:01:18.530 
i think it looks way cool because there
is<00:01:15.900> like<00:01:16.049> some<00:01:16.080> kind<00:01:16.470> of<00:01:16.530> structure<00:01:16.740> tit<00:01:17.540> I've

00:01:18.530 --> 00:01:18.540 
is like some kind of structure tit I've

00:01:18.540 --> 00:01:20.570 
is like some kind of structure tit I've
got<00:01:18.720> creative<00:01:18.990> on<00:01:19.110> so<00:01:19.320> i<00:01:19.350> cant<00:01:19.650> a<00:01:19.710> break

00:01:20.570 --> 00:01:20.580 
got creative on so i cant a break

00:02:04.609 --> 00:02:04.619 
notch is I mean the whole thing of

00:02:04.619 --> 00:02:06.649 
notch is I mean the whole thing of
Minecraft<00:02:05.040> is<00:02:05.189> to<00:02:05.369> be<00:02:05.520> oh<00:02:05.729> you<00:02:06.180> could<00:02:06.329> go<00:02:06.479> on
