alright<00:01:51.340> so<00:01:52.649> first<00:01:53.649> things<00:01:53.920> first<00:01:54.180> this<00:01:55.180> is<00:01:55.479> a

00:01:55.499 --> 00:01:55.509 
alright so first things first this is a

00:01:55.509 --> 00:01:59.370 
alright so first things first this is a

plastic card and it has some information

00:01:59.380 --> 00:02:04.499 
plastic card and it has some information
on<00:01:59.770> the<00:01:59.860> back<00:02:00.420> basically<00:02:02.130> it's<00:02:03.130> I<00:02:03.549> think<00:02:04.299> it's

00:02:04.499 --> 00:02:04.509 
on the back basically it's I think it's

00:02:04.509 --> 00:02:05.520 
on the back basically it's I think it's
random<00:02:04.960> I<00:02:05.020> don't<00:02:05.140> think<00:02:05.289> there's<00:02:05.439> like

00:02:05.520 --> 00:02:05.530 
random I don't think there's like

00:02:05.530 --> 00:02:09.389 
random I don't think there's like
anything<00:02:06.100> major<00:02:06.520> with<00:02:06.789> it<00:02:06.939> but<00:02:07.920> it<00:02:08.920> has<00:02:09.069> a<00:02:09.099> code

00:02:09.389 --> 00:02:09.399 
anything major with it but it has a code

00:02:09.399 --> 00:02:10.440 
anything major with it but it has a code
on<00:02:09.429> the<00:02:09.670> back<00:02:09.700> I<00:02:09.849> don't<00:02:10.119> think<00:02:10.239> it's<00:02:10.360> the<00:02:10.420> right

00:02:10.440 --> 00:02:10.450 
on the back I don't think it's the right

00:02:10.450 --> 00:02:12.240 
on the back I don't think it's the right
code<00:02:10.840> because<00:02:11.140> I've<00:02:11.260> seen<00:02:11.739> the<00:02:11.830> other<00:02:11.980> codes

00:02:12.240 --> 00:02:12.250 
code because I've seen the other codes

00:02:12.250 --> 00:02:14.250 
code because I've seen the other codes
but<00:02:12.819> it's<00:02:12.970> like<00:02:13.060> a<00:02:13.090> little<00:02:13.330> credit<00:02:13.510> card<00:02:13.780> I'm<00:02:14.200> a
