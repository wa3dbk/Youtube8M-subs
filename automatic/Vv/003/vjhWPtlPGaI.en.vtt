00:00:00.199 --> 00:00:03.199
 two 

00:00:03.840 --> 00:00:09.960
 50 marches in the country 17 of them in the 

00:00:07.350 --> 00:00:12.000
 capital the students seconded the 

00:00:09.960 --> 00:00:15.090
 strike together with thousands of peasants 

00:00:12.000 --> 00:00:17.189
 health workers truckers and 

00:00:15.090 --> 00:00:19.350
 trade unionists who came together in the 

00:00:17.189 --> 00:00:21.390
 plaza de bolÃ­var 

00:00:19.350 --> 00:00:24.050
 I did not have to express the deepest 

00:00:21.390 --> 00:00:24.050
 solidarity 

00:00:24.700 --> 00:00:32.059
 and among other claims farmers 

00:00:30.529 --> 00:00:34.790
 they demand that the 

00:00:32.059 --> 00:00:36.680
 imports from europe and usa that 

00:00:34.790 --> 00:00:38.710
 increased by the treaties of free 

00:00:36.680 --> 00:00:38.710
 Commerce 

00:00:38.980 --> 00:00:42.250
 it is possible that we being the 

00:00:41.079 --> 00:00:44.559
 largest producers of potatoes 

00:00:42.250 --> 00:00:46.420
 Latin America we do not have that we are 

00:00:44.559 --> 00:00:48.340
 importing potatoes this is an absurdity that 

00:00:46.420 --> 00:00:51.160
 only fits in the head 

00:00:48.340 --> 00:00:53.440
 holy government after 11 days of a 

00:00:51.160 --> 00:00:56.050
 strike more and more violent saints 

00:00:53.440 --> 00:00:59.220
 he asked for calm but finally recognized the 

00:00:56.050 --> 00:01:02.540
 validity of the protests without any doubt 

00:00:59.220 --> 00:01:06.410
 we are going through a storm 

00:01:02.540 --> 00:01:11.600
 a storm that was formed by the 

00:01:06.410 --> 00:01:13.700
 accumulation of abandonment and lack of 

00:01:11.600 --> 00:01:16.409
 policies in the agricultural sector 

00:01:13.700 --> 00:01:18.929
 for a very long time 

00:01:16.409 --> 00:01:20.909
 the march that ended with riots is 

00:01:18.929 --> 00:01:22.920
 another front open when three are missing 

00:01:20.909 --> 00:01:25.109
 months for saints to decide 

00:01:22.920 --> 00:01:27.149
 officially if he will be a candidate 

00:01:25.109 --> 00:01:29.340
 presidential election 

00:01:27.149 --> 00:01:32.009
 could coincide with a referendum on 

00:01:29.340 --> 00:01:34.649
 peace your government has been negotiating with 

00:01:32.009 --> 00:01:36.539
 The FARC since November on Wednesday 

00:01:34.649 --> 00:01:38.969
 constitutional court approved a 

00:01:36.539 --> 00:01:40.649
 legislative reform because it will allow 

00:01:38.969 --> 00:01:41.909
 the rebels participate in life 

00:01:40.649 --> 00:01:44.759
 politics of colombia 

00:01:41.909 --> 00:01:46.709
 once a peace agreement has been reached 

00:01:44.759 --> 00:01:48.750
 Wednesday also opened the door to 

00:01:46.709 --> 00:01:50.849
 a peace negotiation with the second 

00:01:48.750 --> 00:01:53.099
 guerrilla of the country the army of 

00:01:50.849 --> 00:01:55.709
 national liberation another glimpse of 

00:01:53.099 --> 00:01:58.250
 hope to end 50 years of 

00:01:55.709 --> 00:01:58.250
 armed conflict
