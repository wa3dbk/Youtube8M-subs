hours
I<00:02:13.849> have<00:02:14.209> fermented<00:02:14.660> this<00:02:14.810> for<00:02:14.959> about<00:02:15.110> 18<00:02:15.500> hours

00:02:15.640 --> 00:02:15.650 
I have fermented this for about 18 hours

00:02:15.650 --> 00:02:18.550 
I have fermented this for about 18 hours
it'll<00:02:16.280> go<00:02:16.489> faster<00:02:17.180> in<00:02:17.360> warmer<00:02:17.989> temperatures

00:02:18.550 --> 00:02:18.560 
it'll go faster in warmer temperatures

00:02:18.560 --> 00:02:21.280 
it'll go faster in warmer temperatures
and<00:02:18.920> with<00:02:19.099> more<00:02:19.280> grains<00:02:19.610> and<00:02:19.910> it'll<00:02:20.510> go<00:02:20.660> slower

00:02:21.280 --> 00:02:21.290 
and with more grains and it'll go slower

00:02:21.290 --> 00:02:23.380 
and with more grains and it'll go slower
in<00:02:21.620> cooler<00:02:22.069> temperatures<00:02:22.370> or<00:02:22.819> with<00:02:23.000> fewer

00:02:23.380 --> 00:02:23.390

00:02:23.390 --> 00:02:25.479 
in cooler temperatures or with fewer
grains<00:02:23.709> what<00:02:24.709> we're<00:02:24.800> going<00:02:24.920> to<00:02:24.980> do<00:02:25.099> is<00:02:25.310> go

00:02:25.479 --> 00:02:25.489 
grains what we're going to do is go

00:02:25.489 --> 00:02:28.119 
grains what we're going to do is go
ahead<00:02:25.580> and<00:02:25.819> just<00:02:26.030> strain<00:02:26.510> out<00:02:26.780> that<00:02:27.319> kefir

00:02:28.119 --> 00:02:28.129 
ahead and just strain out that kefir

00:02:28.129 --> 00:02:29.949 
ahead and just strain out that kefir
from<00:02:28.760> the<00:02:28.849> grains<00:02:29.090> so<00:02:29.269> that<00:02:29.300> we<00:02:29.480> can<00:02:29.660> reuse

00:02:29.949 --> 00:02:29.959 
from the grains so that we can reuse

00:02:29.959 --> 00:02:32.470 
from the grains so that we can reuse
those<00:02:30.200> kefir<00:02:30.650> grains<00:02:30.980> for<00:02:31.489> a<00:02:31.519> future<00:02:31.940> batch

00:02:32.470 --> 00:02:32.480 
those kefir grains for a future batch

00:02:32.480 --> 00:02:35.680 
those kefir grains for a future batch
just<00:02:33.470> need<00:02:33.620> a<00:02:33.650> fine<00:02:33.890> mesh<00:02:34.099> sieve<00:02:34.849> and<00:02:35.330> a<00:02:35.510> bowl
