00:00:26.060 --> 00:00:26.070 
at this football game it was a great

00:00:26.070 --> 00:00:27.679 
at this football game it was a great
offense<00:00:26.460> and<00:00:26.640> defensive<00:00:27.060> game<00:00:27.240> and<00:00:27.390> I<00:00:27.420> think

00:00:27.679 --> 00:00:27.689 
offense and defensive game and I think

00:00:27.689 --> 00:00:29.240 
offense and defensive game and I think
it<00:00:27.810> the<00:00:28.109> main<00:00:28.260> things<00:00:28.470> it<00:00:28.590> puts<00:00:28.800> us<00:00:28.890> back<00:00:29.010> in<00:00:29.070> a

00:00:29.240 --> 00:00:29.250 
it the main things it puts us back in a

00:00:29.250 --> 00:00:31.310 
it the main things it puts us back in a
bowl<00:00:29.460> picture<00:00:29.820> and<00:00:30.060> it's<00:00:30.810> great<00:00:31.019> to<00:00:31.140> see<00:00:31.289> I

00:00:31.310 --> 00:00:31.320 
bowl picture and it's great to see I

00:00:31.320 --> 00:00:32.569 
bowl picture and it's great to see I
think<00:00:31.560> our<00:00:31.650> offense<00:00:31.890> really<00:00:32.130> took<00:00:32.309> advantage

00:00:32.569 --> 00:00:32.579 
think our offense really took advantage

00:00:32.579 --> 00:00:33.979 
think our offense really took advantage
of<00:00:32.759> Illinois's<00:00:33.090> defense<00:00:33.540> by<00:00:33.660> running<00:00:33.870> the

00:00:33.979 --> 00:00:33.989 
of Illinois's defense by running the

00:00:33.989 --> 00:00:36.380 
of Illinois's defense by running the
option<00:00:34.350> you<00:00:34.920> know<00:00:35.010> when<00:00:35.730> a<00:00:35.940> team<00:00:36.149> I<00:00:36.239> kill

00:00:36.380 --> 00:00:36.390 
option you know when a team I kill

00:00:36.390 --> 00:00:37.340 
option you know when a team I kill
annoyed<00:00:36.600> plays<00:00:36.780> that<00:00:36.930> much<00:00:37.050> man-to-man

00:00:37.340 --> 00:00:37.350

00:00:37.350 --> 00:00:39.260 
annoyed plays that much man-to-man
covers<00:00:37.800> they<00:00:37.890> don't<00:00:38.070> have<00:00:38.219> hard<00:00:38.820> support<00:00:39.210> in

00:00:39.260 --> 00:00:39.270

the second there and I think that's why

00:00:40.379 --> 00:00:42.709 
the second there and I think that's why
I<00:00:40.410> went<00:00:40.649> to<00:00:40.770> play<00:00:41.280> winner<00:00:41.600> unbelievable<00:00:42.600> right
