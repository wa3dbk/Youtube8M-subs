doing really good and I do think that
NBA<00:01:22.590> 2k15<00:01:23.400> should<00:01:24.030> be<00:01:24.240> keeping<00:01:24.570> up<00:01:24.960> with<00:01:25.380> these

00:01:25.520 --> 00:01:25.530 
NBA 2k15 should be keeping up with these

00:01:25.530 --> 00:01:26.870 
NBA 2k15 should be keeping up with these
emerald<00:01:25.979> cards<00:01:26.310> because<00:01:26.430> there's<00:01:26.640> a<00:01:26.729> lot<00:01:26.850> of

00:01:26.870 --> 00:01:26.880 
emerald cards because there's a lot of

00:01:26.880 --> 00:01:28.219 
emerald cards because there's a lot of
players<00:01:27.090> that<00:01:27.240> I've<00:01:27.479> been<00:01:27.600> doing<00:01:27.750> really<00:01:28.020> good

00:01:28.219 --> 00:01:28.229 
players that I've been doing really good

00:01:28.229 --> 00:01:31.160 
players that I've been doing really good
lately<00:01:28.290> and<00:01:28.920> I<00:01:29.640> feel<00:01:29.850> that<00:01:30.000> they<00:01:30.150> do<00:01:30.210> deserve<00:01:30.600> a

00:01:31.160 --> 00:01:31.170 
lately and I feel that they do deserve a

00:01:31.170 --> 00:01:34.280 
lately and I feel that they do deserve a
card<00:01:32.159> on<00:01:32.310> my<00:01:32.520> team<00:01:32.759> that<00:01:32.790> has<00:01:33.060> a<00:01:33.090> higher<00:01:33.869> stats

00:01:34.280 --> 00:01:34.290 
card on my team that has a higher stats

00:01:34.290 --> 00:01:35.870 
card on my team that has a higher stats
for<00:01:34.680> their<00:01:34.860> players<00:01:35.130> and<00:01:35.460> other<00:01:35.549> one<00:01:35.729> being

00:01:35.870 --> 00:01:35.880 
for their players and other one being

00:01:35.880 --> 00:01:37.399 
for their players and other one being
jeff<00:01:36.180> Teague<00:01:36.509> jeff<00:01:36.750> Teague<00:01:36.960> has<00:01:37.079> been<00:01:37.229> doing

00:01:37.399 --> 00:01:37.409 
jeff Teague jeff Teague has been doing

00:01:37.409 --> 00:01:40.760 
jeff Teague jeff Teague has been doing
amazing<00:01:37.860> so<00:01:38.670> his<00:01:39.060> stats<00:01:39.500> don't<00:01:40.500> really

00:01:40.760 --> 00:01:40.770 
amazing so his stats don't really

00:01:40.770 --> 00:01:43.249 
amazing so his stats don't really
reflect<00:01:40.920> that<00:01:41.340> on<00:01:41.579> his<00:01:41.909> current<00:01:42.360> a<00:01:42.810> card

00:01:43.249 --> 00:01:43.259 
reflect that on his current a card

00:01:43.259 --> 00:01:45.380 
reflect that on his current a card
that's<00:01:43.409> available<00:01:43.680> on<00:01:44.070> my<00:01:44.250> team<00:01:44.490> so<00:01:45.270> I<00:01:45.299> think

00:01:45.380 --> 00:01:45.390 
that's available on my team so I think

00:01:45.390 --> 00:01:46.910 
that's available on my team so I think
that<00:01:45.600> they<00:01:45.720> should<00:01:45.750> release<00:01:46.049> an<00:01:46.320> emerald<00:01:46.680> card

00:01:46.910 --> 00:01:46.920 
that they should release an emerald card

00:01:46.920 --> 00:01:49.010 
that they should release an emerald card
so<00:01:47.340> that<00:01:47.369> we<00:01:47.640> can<00:01:47.820> be<00:01:47.939> able<00:01:48.149> to<00:01:48.240> see<00:01:48.509> that<00:01:48.750> and

00:01:49.010 --> 00:01:49.020 
so that we can be able to see that and

pretty decent as well with Memphis so
like<00:04:10.890> I<00:04:11.040> said<00:04:11.100> these<00:04:11.430> are<00:04:11.490> just<00:04:11.730> some<00:04:11.940> cards<00:04:12.510> of

00:04:12.770 --> 00:04:12.780 
like I said these are just some cards of

00:04:12.780 --> 00:04:14.900 
like I said these are just some cards of
some<00:04:13.590> players<00:04:13.860> that<00:04:14.160> I<00:04:14.250> feel<00:04:14.430> I've<00:04:14.520> been<00:04:14.550> doing

00:04:14.900 --> 00:04:14.910 
some players that I feel I've been doing

00:04:14.910 --> 00:04:16.880 
some players that I feel I've been doing
pretty<00:04:15.090> good<00:04:15.390> this<00:04:15.600> season<00:04:15.780> and<00:04:16.260> their

00:04:16.880 --> 00:04:16.890 
pretty good this season and their

00:04:16.890 --> 00:04:19.789 
pretty good this season and their
overalls<00:04:17.540> with<00:04:18.540> their<00:04:18.750> current<00:04:18.989> cards<00:04:19.560> of

00:04:19.789 --> 00:04:19.799 
overalls with their current cards of

00:04:19.799 --> 00:04:22.640 
overalls with their current cards of
being<00:04:20.160> gold<00:04:20.520> silver<00:04:21.000> bronze<00:04:21.239> whatever<00:04:21.750> don't

00:04:22.640 --> 00:04:22.650 
being gold silver bronze whatever don't

00:04:22.650 --> 00:04:25.730 
being gold silver bronze whatever don't
reflect<00:04:22.919> that<00:04:23.310> so<00:04:24.060> I<00:04:24.390> think<00:04:24.510> that<00:04:24.780> NBA<00:04:25.290> 2k

00:04:25.730 --> 00:04:25.740 
reflect that so I think that NBA 2k

00:04:25.740 --> 00:04:26.620 
reflect that so I think that NBA 2k
should<00:04:26.040> make<00:04:26.250> these

00:04:26.620 --> 00:04:26.630 
should make these

00:04:26.630 --> 00:04:28.540 
should make these
words<00:04:26.780> so<00:04:27.440> that<00:04:27.560> we<00:04:27.680> can<00:04:27.830> be<00:04:27.950> able<00:04:28.130> to<00:04:28.190> use<00:04:28.310> them

00:04:28.540 --> 00:04:28.550 
words so that we can be able to use them

00:04:28.550 --> 00:04:30.790 
words so that we can be able to use them
and<00:04:28.870> because<00:04:29.870> they<00:04:30.110> deserve<00:04:30.440> them<00:04:30.590> they

00:04:30.790 --> 00:04:30.800
