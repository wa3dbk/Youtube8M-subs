coming through the line and you want to

00:03:58.680 --> 00:04:00.050 
coming through the line and you want to
make<00:03:58.860> sure<00:03:58.890> not<00:03:59.340> just<00:03:59.370> until<00:03:59.910> it<00:04:00.030> starts

00:04:00.050 --> 00:04:00.060 
make sure not just until it starts

00:04:00.060 --> 00:04:01.400 
make sure not just until it starts
dripping<00:04:00.510> you<00:04:00.720> want<00:04:00.870> to<00:04:00.960> make<00:04:01.080> sure<00:04:01.110> there's

00:04:01.400 --> 00:04:01.410 
dripping you want to make sure there's

00:04:01.410 --> 00:04:04.990 
dripping you want to make sure there's
no<00:04:01.680> air<00:04:01.920> bubbles<00:04:02.090> in<00:04:03.090> the<00:04:03.360> line<00:04:03.540> whatsoever

00:04:04.990 --> 00:04:05.000 
no air bubbles in the line whatsoever

00:04:05.000 --> 00:04:08.210 
no air bubbles in the line whatsoever
right<00:04:06.000> so<00:04:06.750> once<00:04:06.990> this<00:04:07.230> is<00:04:07.290> fully<00:04:07.800> fully

00:04:08.210 --> 00:04:08.220 
right so once this is fully fully

00:04:08.220 --> 00:04:10.520 
right so once this is fully fully
flushed<00:04:08.550> I<00:04:08.820> take<00:04:09.270> my<00:04:09.450> set<00:04:09.750> and<00:04:09.930> then<00:04:10.200> clamp<00:04:10.350> it

00:04:10.520 --> 00:04:10.530 
flushed I take my set and then clamp it

00:04:10.530 --> 00:04:14.150 
flushed I take my set and then clamp it
here<00:04:11.150> right<00:04:12.150> I<00:04:12.420> bring<00:04:13.170> this<00:04:13.320> to<00:04:13.380> my<00:04:13.620> pump

00:04:14.150 --> 00:04:14.160 
here right I bring this to my pump

00:04:14.160 --> 00:04:17.660 
here right I bring this to my pump
I<00:04:15.080> place<00:04:16.080> my<00:04:16.380> cassette<00:04:17.040> I<00:04:17.190> make<00:04:17.400> sure<00:04:17.520> it's

00:04:17.660 --> 00:04:17.670 
I place my cassette I make sure it's

00:04:17.670 --> 00:04:21.979 
I place my cassette I make sure it's
flush<00:04:17.910> pulled<00:04:18.299> away<00:04:18.420> in<00:04:19.850> and<00:04:20.850> then<00:04:21.000> they<00:04:21.090> push

00:04:21.979 --> 00:04:21.989 
flush pulled away in and then they push

00:04:21.989 --> 00:04:25.520 
flush pulled away in and then they push
it<00:04:22.140> in<00:04:22.260> right<00:04:23.180> so<00:04:24.180> then<00:04:24.360> you<00:04:24.480> press<00:04:25.110> channel<00:04:25.410> a

00:04:25.520 --> 00:04:25.530 
it in right so then you press channel a

00:04:25.530 --> 00:04:27.500 
it in right so then you press channel a
and<00:04:25.850> then<00:04:26.850> you<00:04:26.880> start

00:04:27.500 --> 00:04:27.510 
and then you start

00:04:27.510 --> 00:04:31.100 
and then you start
so<00:04:28.350> now<00:04:28.530> it's<00:04:29.250> running<00:04:29.490> right<00:04:30.270> you<00:04:30.750> will<00:04:30.870> come

00:04:31.100 --> 00:04:31.110 
so now it's running right you will come

00:04:31.110 --> 00:04:33.500 
so now it's running right you will come
to<00:04:31.230> the<00:04:31.320> patient<00:04:31.710> you'll<00:04:32.670> have<00:04:33.060> this<00:04:33.270> hair

00:04:33.500 --> 00:04:33.510 
to the patient you'll have this hair

00:04:33.510 --> 00:04:39.140 
to the patient you'll have this hair
plug<00:04:33.950> right<00:04:35.330> so<00:04:36.330> imagine<00:04:36.750> this<00:04:36.840> is<00:04:37.400> and<00:04:38.400> it's

00:04:39.140 --> 00:04:39.150 
plug right so imagine this is and it's

00:04:39.150 --> 00:04:42.590 
plug right so imagine this is and it's
only<00:04:39.570> check<00:04:40.380> fluid<00:04:40.710> side<00:04:40.920> right<00:04:41.340> so<00:04:41.910> when<00:04:42.450> this

00:04:42.590 --> 00:04:42.600 
only check fluid side right so when this

00:04:42.600 --> 00:04:44.090 
only check fluid side right so when this
pumps<00:04:42.930> you<00:04:42.990> have<00:04:43.080> to<00:04:43.170> confirm<00:04:43.470> it<00:04:43.530> every<00:04:43.890> time

00:04:44.090 --> 00:04:44.100 
pumps you have to confirm it every time

00:04:44.100 --> 00:04:48.110 
pumps you have to confirm it every time
you<00:04:45.090> confirm<00:04:45.480> and<00:04:45.780> start<00:04:46.550> so<00:04:47.550> we<00:04:47.730> confirmed

00:04:48.110 --> 00:04:48.120 
you confirm and start so we confirmed

00:04:48.120 --> 00:04:52.370 
you confirm and start so we confirmed
that<00:04:48.180> nothing<00:04:48.390> is<00:04:48.720> closed<00:04:49.470> so<00:04:49.980> all<00:04:50.160> my<00:04:51.380> watches

00:04:52.370 --> 00:04:52.380 
that nothing is closed so all my watches

00:04:52.380 --> 00:04:54.980 
that nothing is closed so all my watches
are<00:04:52.530> all<00:04:52.710> open<00:04:52.860> so<00:04:53.820> it's<00:04:53.970> infusing<00:04:54.360> so<00:04:54.690> what

00:04:54.980 --> 00:04:54.990 
are all open so it's infusing so what

00:04:54.990 --> 00:04:55.850 
are all open so it's infusing so what
you're<00:04:55.110> going<00:04:55.230> to<00:04:55.260> do<00:04:55.440> is<00:04:55.560> you're<00:04:55.680> going<00:04:55.710> to

00:04:55.850 --> 00:04:55.860 
you're going to do is you're going to

00:04:55.860 --> 00:05:07.700 
you're going to do is you're going to
take<00:04:56.570> the<00:04:57.570> end<00:04:57.780> of<00:04:57.960> your<00:05:04.550> tubing<00:05:05.550> here<00:05:06.710> take

00:05:07.700 --> 00:05:07.710 
take the end of your tubing here take

00:05:07.710 --> 00:05:08.810 
take the end of your tubing here take
could<00:05:07.860> unravel<00:05:08.160> it<00:05:08.400> here

00:05:08.810 --> 00:05:08.820 
could unravel it here

00:05:08.820 --> 00:05:11.720 
could unravel it here
I'm<00:05:09.120> not<00:05:09.300> going<00:05:09.450> honorable<00:05:09.810> a<00:05:09.870> fully<00:05:10.430> so<00:05:11.430> here

00:05:11.720 --> 00:05:11.730 
I'm not going honorable a fully so here

00:05:11.730 --> 00:05:13.460 
I'm not going honorable a fully so here
you<00:05:12.240> don't<00:05:12.360> imagine<00:05:12.630> this<00:05:12.870> is<00:05:13.020> the<00:05:13.110> patient

00:05:13.460 --> 00:05:13.470 
you don't imagine this is the patient

00:05:13.470 --> 00:05:14.900 
you don't imagine this is the patient
and<00:05:13.590> this<00:05:13.680> is<00:05:13.740> just<00:05:14.070> peripheral<00:05:14.430> IV<00:05:14.790> access

00:05:14.900 --> 00:05:14.910 
and this is just peripheral IV access

00:05:14.910 --> 00:05:17.660 
and this is just peripheral IV access
they<00:05:15.840> just<00:05:16.230> remove<00:05:16.560> your<00:05:16.770> gonna<00:05:16.980> clean<00:05:17.520> it

00:05:17.660 --> 00:05:17.670 
they just remove your gonna clean it

00:05:17.670 --> 00:05:20.180 
they just remove your gonna clean it
with<00:05:17.790> alcohol<00:05:18.230> chlorhexidine<00:05:19.230> make<00:05:19.710> sure<00:05:19.920> it

00:05:20.180 --> 00:05:20.190 
with alcohol chlorhexidine make sure it

00:05:20.190 --> 00:05:23.860 
with alcohol chlorhexidine make sure it
dries<00:05:20.430> out<00:05:20.640> right<00:05:21.570> and<00:05:21.930> once<00:05:22.110> it's<00:05:22.260> dried

00:05:23.860 --> 00:05:23.870 
dries out right and once it's dried

00:05:23.870 --> 00:05:27.640 
dries out right and once it's dried
you're<00:05:24.870> gonna<00:05:24.990> connect<00:05:25.440> them<00:05:25.820> to<00:05:26.820> your<00:05:26.850> fluids

00:05:27.640 --> 00:05:27.650 
you're gonna connect them to your fluids

00:05:27.650 --> 00:05:30.590 
you're gonna connect them to your fluids
so<00:05:28.650> now<00:05:28.830> what<00:05:29.790> infusing<00:05:30.360> you're<00:05:30.480> gonna

00:05:30.590 --> 00:05:30.600 
so now what infusing you're gonna

00:05:30.600 --> 00:05:32.390 
so now what infusing you're gonna
obviously<00:05:31.020> check<00:05:31.230> the<00:05:31.410> site<00:05:31.890> when<00:05:32.250> your

00:05:32.390 --> 00:05:32.400 
obviously check the site when your

00:05:32.400 --> 00:05:37.010 
obviously check the site when your
filtration<00:05:32.640> or<00:05:34.970> any<00:05:35.970> edema<00:05:36.480> or<00:05:36.630> anything<00:05:36.840> like

you can actually write in your rate the

00:05:52.740 --> 00:05:57.410 
you can actually write in your rate the
greater<00:05:52.860> than<00:05:53.160> a<00:05:53.220> hundred<00:05:53.580> here<00:05:55.580> and<00:05:56.580> well<00:05:56.760> I<00:05:56.970> I

greater than a hundred here and well I I

00:05:57.420 --> 00:06:00.970 
greater than a hundred here and well I I
write<00:05:58.020> enough<00:05:58.350> to<00:05:58.680> this<00:05:58.860> denote<00:05:59.520> which<00:05:59.880> a

the next one I'm gonna talk about

00:06:53.790 --> 00:06:57.580 
the next one I'm gonna talk about
basically<00:06:54.419> this<00:06:55.290> was<00:06:55.440> your<00:06:55.590> basic<00:06:55.710> setup<00:06:56.540> here

00:06:57.580 --> 00:06:57.590 
basically this was your basic setup here

00:06:57.590 --> 00:07:01.129 
basically this was your basic setup here
patient<00:06:58.590> did<00:06:59.070> not<00:06:59.100> require<00:06:59.580> to<00:06:59.790> be<00:07:00.139> time

00:07:01.129 --> 00:07:01.139 
patient did not require to be time

00:07:01.139 --> 00:07:02.930 
patient did not require to be time
sensitive<00:07:01.620> meaning<00:07:01.860> if<00:07:02.250> they<00:07:02.400> will<00:07:02.550> poke<00:07:02.760> the

00:07:02.930 --> 00:07:02.940 
sensitive meaning if they will poke the

00:07:02.940 --> 00:07:05.510 
sensitive meaning if they will poke the
pump<00:07:03.180> of<00:07:03.330> this<00:07:03.510> fluid<00:07:03.870> for<00:07:04.320> two<00:07:05.010> minutes<00:07:05.340> or<00:07:05.460> a

00:07:05.510 --> 00:07:05.520 
pump of this fluid for two minutes or a

00:07:05.520 --> 00:07:06.770 
pump of this fluid for two minutes or a
minute<00:07:05.760> that<00:07:05.880> it<00:07:06.000> took<00:07:06.090> it's<00:07:06.300> flush

00:07:06.770 --> 00:07:06.780 
minute that it took it's flush

00:07:06.780 --> 00:07:10.520 
minute that it took it's flush
no<00:07:07.139> deleterious<00:07:07.590> effects<00:07:08.100> okay<00:07:08.900> so<00:07:09.900> things

00:07:10.520 --> 00:07:10.530 
no deleterious effects okay so things

00:07:10.530 --> 00:07:11.930 
no deleterious effects okay so things
like<00:07:10.740> normal<00:07:11.340> saline

00:07:11.930 --> 00:07:11.940 
like normal saline

00:07:11.940 --> 00:07:14.540 
like normal saline
maybe<00:07:12.150> heparin<00:07:12.690> stuff<00:07:13.350> like<00:07:13.560> that<00:07:13.710> that<00:07:14.070> are

00:07:14.540 --> 00:07:14.550 
maybe heparin stuff like that that are

00:07:14.550 --> 00:07:17.240 
maybe heparin stuff like that that are
confusing<00:07:15.389> and<00:07:15.960> if<00:07:16.440> disconnected<00:07:17.010> for<00:07:17.190> a

00:07:17.240 --> 00:07:17.250 
confusing and if disconnected for a

00:07:17.250 --> 00:07:18.379 
confusing and if disconnected for a
minute<00:07:17.550> to<00:07:17.669> flush<00:07:17.880> the<00:07:18.000> lines

00:07:18.379 --> 00:07:18.389 
minute to flush the lines

00:07:18.389 --> 00:07:20.629 
minute to flush the lines
there'd<00:07:18.900> be<00:07:18.990> no<00:07:19.139> filters<00:07:19.830> right<00:07:20.160> but<00:07:20.460> however

00:07:20.629 --> 00:07:20.639 
there'd be no filters right but however

00:07:20.639 --> 00:07:21.890 
there'd be no filters right but however
