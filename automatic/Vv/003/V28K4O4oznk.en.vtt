by<00:02:17.340> side<00:02:18.200> all<00:02:19.200> right<00:02:19.410> so<00:02:19.560> the<00:02:19.650> next<00:02:19.680> one<00:02:19.920> we're

00:02:20.089 --> 00:02:20.099 
by side all right so the next one we're

00:02:20.099 --> 00:02:22.460 
by side all right so the next one we're
doing<00:02:20.190> is<00:02:20.370> Neptune<00:02:20.730> and<00:02:21.110> Neptune<00:02:22.110> is<00:02:22.230> humans

00:02:22.460 --> 00:02:22.470 
doing is Neptune and Neptune is humans

00:02:22.470 --> 00:02:24.470 
doing is Neptune and Neptune is humans
you<00:02:23.040> know<00:02:23.129> he's<00:02:23.370> even<00:02:23.700> farther<00:02:23.940> from<00:02:24.150> the<00:02:24.300> Sun

00:02:24.470 --> 00:02:24.480 
you know he's even farther from the Sun

00:02:24.480 --> 00:02:27.229 
you know he's even farther from the Sun
than<00:02:24.599> Uranus<00:02:24.930> and<00:02:25.230> Neptune<00:02:26.099> is<00:02:26.640> cold

00:02:27.229 --> 00:02:27.239 
than Uranus and Neptune is cold

00:02:27.239 --> 00:02:30.610 
than Uranus and Neptune is cold
the<00:02:27.810> blue<00:02:28.580> is<00:02:29.580> cloud

00:02:30.610 --> 00:02:30.620 
the blue is cloud

00:02:30.620 --> 00:02:34.670 
the blue is cloud
yeah<00:02:31.620> and<00:02:31.860> um<00:02:32.400> I<00:02:32.670> was<00:02:33.420> actually<00:02:33.540> discovered<00:02:34.470> as

00:02:34.670 --> 00:02:34.680 
yeah and um I was actually discovered as

00:02:34.680 --> 00:02:37.610 
yeah and um I was actually discovered as
a<00:02:34.739> result<00:02:35.580> of<00:02:35.819> a<00:02:35.849> mathematical<00:02:36.750> prediction

00:02:37.610 --> 00:02:37.620 
a result of a mathematical prediction

00:02:37.620 --> 00:02:43.070 
a result of a mathematical prediction
and<00:02:38.870> as<00:02:39.870> rings<00:02:40.650> very<00:02:41.580> small<00:02:41.910> rings<00:02:42.150> and<00:02:42.840> now

00:02:43.070 --> 00:02:43.080 
and as rings very small rings and now

literally used to be considered the

00:02:49.439 --> 00:02:51.589 
literally used to be considered the
ninth<00:02:49.650> planet<00:02:49.980> in<00:02:50.219> our<00:02:50.310> solar<00:02:50.370> system<00:02:51.000> but

00:02:51.589 --> 00:02:51.599 
ninth planet in our solar system but

00:02:51.599 --> 00:02:54.500 
ninth planet in our solar system but
until<00:02:51.930> recently<00:02:52.319> it<00:02:52.590> is<00:02:52.620> now<00:02:52.950> called<00:02:53.400> a<00:02:53.700> dwarf

until recently it is now called a dwarf

until recently it is now called a dwarf
planet<00:02:54.569> which<00:02:55.560> is<00:02:55.769> similar<00:02:56.459> to<00:02:56.519> a<00:02:56.670> planet<00:02:57.120> but

00:02:57.559 --> 00:02:57.569 
planet which is similar to a planet but

00:02:57.569 --> 00:02:59.500 
planet which is similar to a planet but
it<00:02:57.659> has<00:02:57.750> a<00:02:57.780> few<00:02:58.049> different<00:02:58.079> characteristics

it has a few different characteristics

00:02:59.510 --> 00:03:02.179 
it has a few different characteristics
pluto<00:03:00.510> is<00:03:00.689> very<00:03:00.930> different<00:03:01.379> from<00:03:01.469> gas<00:03:01.709> giants

00:03:02.179 --> 00:03:02.189 
pluto is very different from gas giants

00:03:02.189 --> 00:03:04.280 
pluto is very different from gas giants
it<00:03:02.430> has<00:03:02.640> a<00:03:02.670> solid<00:03:03.239> surface<00:03:03.480> and<00:03:03.840> it's<00:03:03.959> much

00:03:04.280 --> 00:03:04.290 
it has a solid surface and it's much

00:03:04.290 --> 00:03:05.599 
it has a solid surface and it's much
smaller<00:03:04.560> and<00:03:04.829> denser<00:03:04.980> than<00:03:05.310> the<00:03:05.370> outer

smaller and denser than the outer

smaller and denser than the outer
planets<00:03:06.090> it's<00:03:06.780> even<00:03:07.049> smaller<00:03:07.200> than<00:03:07.530> Earth's

moon<00:03:08.189> and<00:03:08.959> Pluto<00:03:09.959> is<00:03:10.140> so<00:03:10.439> far<00:03:10.769> away<00:03:11.010> from<00:03:11.159> the

00:03:11.449 --> 00:03:11.459 
moon and Pluto is so far away from the

moon and Pluto is so far away from the
Sun<00:03:11.730> that<00:03:12.000> it<00:03:12.180> takes<00:03:12.409> 248<00:03:13.409> earth<00:03:13.739> years<00:03:13.799> to
