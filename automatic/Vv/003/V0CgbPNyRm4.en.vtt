00:01:32.820 --> 00:01:34.340 
wanted to make and overall I just
thought<00:01:32.909> the<00:01:33.090> project<00:01:33.450> was<00:01:33.570> so<00:01:33.810> cool<00:01:34.079> because

00:01:34.340 --> 00:01:34.350 
thought the project was so cool because

00:01:34.350 --> 00:01:36.800 
thought the project was so cool because
not<00:01:34.680> only<00:01:34.710> is<00:01:35.040> it<00:01:35.250> art<00:01:35.520> but<00:01:36.000> it's<00:01:36.119> also<00:01:36.299> a<00:01:36.479> mask

00:01:36.800 --> 00:01:36.810 
not only is it art but it's also a mask

00:01:36.810 --> 00:01:38.450 
not only is it art but it's also a mask
that<00:01:36.930> you<00:01:37.140> can<00:01:37.290> wear<00:01:37.380> on<00:01:37.560> halloween<00:01:37.710> and<00:01:38.369> you

00:01:38.450 --> 00:01:38.460 
that you can wear on halloween and you

00:01:38.460 --> 00:01:40.399 
that you can wear on halloween and you
can<00:01:38.610> hang<00:01:38.790> up<00:01:38.970> on<00:01:39.119> the<00:01:39.210> wall<00:01:39.479> I<00:01:39.869> just<00:01:40.259> thought

00:01:40.399 --> 00:01:40.409
