 to see how it works 

00:01:39.280 --> 00:01:42.290
 I want to be as honest as possible 

00:01:42.290 --> 00:01:45.190
 since it was not the fact that they sent us 

00:01:45.190 --> 00:01:48.360
 Well, I have to speak well of them, you do not have to be 

00:01:48.360 --> 00:01:51.400
 with these 

00:01:51.400 --> 00:01:54.400
 so those who took care of security forces 

00:01:55.260 --> 00:01:58.260
 let me 

00:02:00.760 --> 00:02:03.760
 swift is helping 

00:02:07.240 --> 00:02:08.989
 as we can see 

00:02:08.989 --> 00:02:12.379
 they are two forms 

00:02:12.379 --> 00:02:15.639
 is the current miss sunshine 

00:02:15.639 --> 00:02:17.469

 and the other one is called 

00:02:19.559 --> 00:02:21.999
 maya bosco that 

00:02:21.999 --> 00:02:24.589
 I'm going to live it in two videos 

00:02:24.589 --> 00:02:28.180
 what can blind people see each one well 

00:02:28.959 --> 00:02:32.119
 so we can see what each case brings 

00:02:32.119 --> 00:02:34.109
 first let's start with these 

00:02:34.109 --> 00:02:37.239
 with the same inc 

00:02:37.239 --> 00:02:40.239
 good we are to open them 6 alpha all 

00:02:41.349 --> 00:02:44.669
 they were the greens 

00:02:44.669 --> 00:02:45.679
 okey 

00:02:45.679 --> 00:02:47.529
 as we can see then 

00:02:47.529 --> 00:02:50.529
 This plastic is a plastic d 

00:02:51.599 --> 00:02:53.029
 Yes of course 

00:02:53.029 --> 00:02:54.509
 good delivered 1 

00:02:54.509 --> 00:02:57.759
 and soft yes it is a good sexy consistency that comes to the pact 

00:02:58.639 --> 00:03:00.840
 so we are going here the tie then 

00:03:00.840 --> 00:03:03.840
 as I tell you today they are dedicated to making their own accessories 

00:03:04.349 --> 00:03:06.339
 procórdoba 

00:03:06.339 --> 00:03:08.679
 and let's see 

00:03:08.679 --> 00:03:11.679
 let's get them out of here 

00:03:13.289 --> 00:03:16.289
 and ready 

00:03:16.869 --> 00:03:19.649
 we take to found 

00:03:19.649 --> 00:03:22.649
 It's a bright red, bright red 

00:03:23.769 --> 00:03:25.419
 behind 

00:03:25.419 --> 00:03:28.419
 bring us proportion wolf 

00:03:30.109 --> 00:03:32.490
 excellent hole for the camera 

00:03:32.490 --> 00:03:34.429
 very spacious 

00:03:34.429 --> 00:03:36.369
 I like that a lot 

00:03:36.369 --> 00:03:38.579
 microphone panel 

00:03:38.579 --> 00:03:40.379
 for the headset 

00:03:40.379 --> 00:03:43.329
 to insert the sim card 

00:03:43.329 --> 00:03:44.529
 to the charge 

00:03:44.529 --> 00:03:45.889
 and you and more 

00:03:45.889 --> 00:03:48.329
 this area is born excellent 

00:03:48.329 --> 00:03:51.329
 and good the holes this time it makes me very good 

00:03:51.839 --> 00:03:54.839
 and well let's put on the ipad 

00:03:56.729 --> 00:03:59.259
 then we fit the buttons 

00:03:59.259 --> 00:04:01.099
 that enter 

00:04:01.099 --> 00:04:04.369
 Ok then if we put a corner 

00:04:05.229 --> 00:04:07.139
 this type of covers 

00:04:07.139 --> 00:04:11.719
 at first the first few times it takes a little bit good it does not take long but it's a bit 

00:04:11.719 --> 00:04:13.959
 complicated to put 

00:04:13.959 --> 00:04:16.099
 as 

00:04:16.099 --> 00:04:20.120
 As they are new we have to be careful to try to get the perception 

00:04:21.459 --> 00:04:23.270
 in this case we can see 

00:04:23.270 --> 00:04:25.020
 how are we 

00:04:25.020 --> 00:04:27.150
 here, nothing else, let's make these 

00:04:27.150 --> 00:04:28.629
 and ready 

00:04:28.629 --> 00:04:30.499
 it is excellent 

00:04:30.499 --> 00:04:32.840
 protect and on the edges 

00:04:32.840 --> 00:04:36.180
 we can see what here 

00:04:36.180 --> 00:04:39.180
 we have for the lock button 

00:04:40.360 --> 00:04:42.650
 Everything is perfect 

00:04:42.650 --> 00:04:44.999
 volume 

00:04:44.999 --> 00:04:47.789
 everything is perfect there is very good 

00:04:47.789 --> 00:04:50.710
 we can press the buttons without having 

00:04:50.710 --> 00:04:52.449
 problem some 

00:04:52.449 --> 00:04:53.930
 the microphone 

00:04:53.930 --> 00:04:55.819
 he leaves it excellent 

00:04:55.819 --> 00:04:59.539
 the holes are very good very well marked this as a small protector 

00:04:59.539 --> 00:05:00.990
 that I have 

00:05:00.990 --> 00:05:03.409
 so they do not get caught 

00:05:03.409 --> 00:05:04.889
 we can see that equally 

00:05:04.889 --> 00:05:07.960
 no problem we can not have 

00:05:07.960 --> 00:05:10.960
 here or state the same sim card excellent 

00:05:11.839 --> 00:05:13.930
 and on the speakers 

00:05:13.930 --> 00:05:15.270
 Well, we can see what 

00:05:15.270 --> 00:05:16.919
 it is a hole 

00:05:16.919 --> 00:05:18.990
 done to perfection 

00:05:18.990 --> 00:05:20.210
 the truth 

00:05:20.210 --> 00:05:22.249
 I liked this form a lot 

00:05:22.249 --> 00:05:23.680
 it feels very good 

00:05:23.680 --> 00:05:26.960
 we can leave it somewhere fixed 

00:05:26.960 --> 00:05:32.870
 and for his 

00:05:32.870 --> 00:05:34.189
 the decal sticker 

00:05:34.189 --> 00:05:35.639
 there is hand 

00:05:35.639 --> 00:05:39.199
 we can see what it is that how can you explain the material 

00:05:39.199 --> 00:05:42.199
 in silicone but it's a silicone 

00:05:43.240 --> 00:05:45.860
 that stays stuck in addition surface 

00:05:45.860 --> 00:05:48.089
 you can leave without fear of falling 

00:05:48.089 --> 00:05:50.089
 I like that a lot 

00:05:50.089 --> 00:05:53.809
 also here a part of the sides we can see 

00:05:54.370 --> 00:05:56.119
 I do not know if it does not show up here 

00:05:56.119 --> 00:05:58.789
 but leave a space 

00:05:58.789 --> 00:06:00.719
 let's say something remarkable 

00:06:00.719 --> 00:06:03.719
 to be able to leave the aipac upside down 

00:06:04.319 --> 00:06:06.439
 without fear that they are 

00:06:06.439 --> 00:06:08.270
 We can see 

00:06:08.270 --> 00:06:11.330
 it's not something and if we do not want to move 

00:06:11.330 --> 00:06:12.759
 it costs work 

00:06:12.759 --> 00:06:15.620
 And as I say, silicon is something hard 

00:06:15.620 --> 00:06:16.770
 is something 

00:06:16.770 --> 00:06:18.499
 very father the truth 

00:06:18.499 --> 00:06:20.439
