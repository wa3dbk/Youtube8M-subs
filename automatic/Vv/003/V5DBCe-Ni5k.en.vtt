and today we're going to teach you how
to<00:00:04.650> play<00:00:05.040> the<00:00:05.430> forehand<00:00:05.850> counterhit<00:00:06.859> let's

00:00:07.849 --> 00:00:07.859 
to play the forehand counterhit let's

00:00:07.859 --> 00:00:09.470 
to play the forehand counterhit let's
have<00:00:08.040> a<00:00:08.069> look<00:00:08.309> at<00:00:08.490> the<00:00:08.790> forehand<00:00:09.240> counterhit

00:00:09.470 --> 00:00:09.480 
have a look at the forehand counterhit

00:00:09.480 --> 00:00:13.370 
have a look at the forehand counterhit
now<00:00:09.950> you'll<00:00:10.950> notice<00:00:11.280> that<00:00:12.030> Jeff's<00:00:12.840> starting

00:00:13.370 --> 00:00:13.380 
now you'll notice that Jeff's starting

00:00:13.380 --> 00:00:16.820 
now you'll notice that Jeff's starting
position<00:00:14.040> is<00:00:14.190> always<00:00:15.089> down<00:00:15.630> beside<00:00:15.870> him<00:00:16.320> with

00:00:16.820 --> 00:00:16.830 
position is always down beside him with

00:00:16.830 --> 00:00:19.340 
position is always down beside him with
his<00:00:16.949> bat<00:00:17.190> facing<00:00:17.970> towards<00:00:18.510> where<00:00:18.810> he<00:00:19.050> wants

00:00:19.340 --> 00:00:19.350 
his bat facing towards where he wants

00:00:19.350 --> 00:00:29.929 
his bat facing towards where he wants
the<00:00:19.439> ball<00:00:19.470> to<00:00:19.650> go<00:00:28.189> from<00:00:29.189> there<00:00:29.460> he<00:00:29.730> comes

00:00:29.929 --> 00:00:29.939 
the ball to go from there he comes

00:00:29.939 --> 00:00:32.780 
the ball to go from there he comes
forward<00:00:30.630> he<00:00:31.170> hits<00:00:31.470> the<00:00:31.679> ball<00:00:31.859> and<00:00:32.160> then<00:00:32.669> he

00:00:32.780 --> 00:00:32.790 
forward he hits the ball and then he

00:00:32.790 --> 00:00:36.200 
forward he hits the ball and then he
finishes<00:00:33.030> up<00:00:33.600> near<00:00:34.260> his<00:00:34.559> right<00:00:34.890> eyebrow<00:00:35.370> each

00:00:36.200 --> 00:00:36.210 
finishes up near his right eyebrow each

00:00:36.210 --> 00:00:50.959 
finishes up near his right eyebrow each
time<00:00:48.289> so<00:00:49.289> there's<00:00:49.680> three<00:00:50.100> critical<00:00:50.550> factors

00:00:50.959 --> 00:00:50.969 
time so there's three critical factors

00:00:50.969 --> 00:00:52.430 
time so there's three critical factors
that<00:00:51.180> you<00:00:51.390> need<00:00:51.539> to<00:00:51.690> consider<00:00:51.840> when<00:00:52.320> you're

00:00:52.430 --> 00:00:52.440 
that you need to consider when you're

00:00:52.440 --> 00:00:54.350 
that you need to consider when you're
learning<00:00:52.590> the<00:00:52.860> forehand<00:00:53.250> counterhit<00:00:53.460> the

00:00:54.350 --> 00:00:54.360 
learning the forehand counterhit the

00:00:54.360 --> 00:00:56.720 
learning the forehand counterhit the
first<00:00:54.600> one<00:00:54.840> is<00:00:55.020> your<00:00:55.559> feet<00:00:55.770> position<00:00:56.219> the

00:00:56.720 --> 00:00:56.730 
first one is your feet position the

00:00:56.730 --> 00:00:58.880 
first one is your feet position the
second<00:00:57.120> is<00:00:57.239> your<00:00:57.510> start<00:00:57.780> position<00:00:58.260> and<00:00:58.379> the

00:00:58.880 --> 00:00:58.890 
second is your start position and the

00:00:58.890 --> 00:01:01.939 
second is your start position and the
third<00:00:59.129> is<00:00:59.430> your<00:01:00.090> finish<00:01:00.420> position<00:01:00.800> so<00:01:01.800> your

00:01:01.939 --> 00:01:01.949 
third is your finish position so your

00:01:01.949 --> 00:01:04.520 
third is your finish position so your
feet<00:01:02.190> need<00:01:02.640> to<00:01:02.670> be<00:01:02.789> square<00:01:02.910> on<00:01:03.570> or<00:01:03.809> slightly

00:01:04.520 --> 00:01:04.530 
feet need to be square on or slightly

00:01:04.530 --> 00:01:07.700 
feet need to be square on or slightly
side<00:01:05.339> on<00:01:05.519> to<00:01:05.700> the<00:01:05.729> table<00:01:06.000> your<00:01:06.869> start<00:01:07.200> position

00:01:07.700 --> 00:01:07.710 
side on to the table your start position

00:01:07.710 --> 00:01:11.120 
side on to the table your start position
needs<00:01:08.400> to<00:01:08.580> be<00:01:08.700> at<00:01:08.880> hip<00:01:09.420> height<00:01:09.830> next<00:01:10.830> to<00:01:10.950> you

00:01:11.120 --> 00:01:11.130 
needs to be at hip height next to you

00:01:11.130 --> 00:01:13.940 
needs to be at hip height next to you
with<00:01:11.880> the<00:01:12.180> whole<00:01:12.479> face<00:01:12.990> of<00:01:13.049> the<00:01:13.320> bat<00:01:13.500> facing

00:01:13.940 --> 00:01:13.950 
with the whole face of the bat facing

00:01:13.950 --> 00:01:15.590 
with the whole face of the bat facing
towards<00:01:14.520> where<00:01:14.760> you<00:01:14.880> want<00:01:15.090> the<00:01:15.210> ball<00:01:15.390> to<00:01:15.420> go

00:01:15.590 --> 00:01:15.600 
towards where you want the ball to go

00:01:15.600 --> 00:01:18.830 
towards where you want the ball to go
this<00:01:16.350> is<00:01:16.680> really<00:01:17.340> important<00:01:17.909> to<00:01:18.330> develop<00:01:18.479> a

00:01:18.830 --> 00:01:18.840 
this is really important to develop a

00:01:18.840 --> 00:01:21.620 
this is really important to develop a
good<00:01:19.020> counter<00:01:19.380> head<00:01:19.530> stroke<00:01:20.119> the<00:01:21.119> third<00:01:21.330> thing

00:01:21.620 --> 00:01:21.630 
good counter head stroke the third thing

00:01:21.630 --> 00:01:24.140 
good counter head stroke the third thing
is<00:01:21.810> to<00:01:22.350> make<00:01:22.830> sure<00:01:22.860> when<00:01:23.610> you<00:01:23.729> hit<00:01:23.880> the<00:01:24.000> ball

00:01:24.140 --> 00:01:24.150 
is to make sure when you hit the ball

00:01:24.150 --> 00:01:27.109 
is to make sure when you hit the ball
that<00:01:24.450> you<00:01:24.540> come<00:01:24.780> up<00:01:24.810> and<00:01:25.110> finish<00:01:25.650> at<00:01:26.119> around

00:01:27.109 --> 00:01:27.119 
that you come up and finish at around

00:01:27.119 --> 00:01:37.390 
that you come up and finish at around
near<00:01:27.750> your<00:01:28.110> right<00:01:28.590> eyebrow

00:01:37.390 --> 00:01:37.400 

00:01:37.400 --> 00:01:40.270 

so<00:01:38.060> three<00:01:38.990> factors<00:01:39.410> for<00:01:39.620> a<00:01:39.650> great<00:01:39.980> forehand

00:01:40.270 --> 00:01:40.280 
so three factors for a great forehand

00:01:40.280 --> 00:01:44.580 
so three factors for a great forehand
counterhit<00:01:41.200> feet<00:01:42.200> position<00:01:42.710> start<00:01:43.430> position

counterhit feet position start position

00:01:44.590 --> 00:01:48.580 
counterhit feet position start position

00:01:48.580 --> 00:01:48.590 
finish position after years of practice

00:01:48.590 --> 00:01:51.670

Jeff's<00:01:49.160> forehand<00:01:49.880> county<00:01:50.240> is<00:01:50.420> really<00:01:51.140> well

00:01:51.670 --> 00:01:51.680 
Jeff's forehand county is really well

00:01:51.680 --> 00:01:54.670 
Jeff's forehand county is really well
grooved<00:01:52.750> you'll<00:01:53.750> notice<00:01:54.140> that<00:01:54.260> it<00:01:54.380> always

00:01:54.670 --> 00:01:54.680 
grooved you'll notice that it always

00:01:54.680 --> 00:01:57.400 
grooved you'll notice that it always
starts<00:01:55.310> in<00:01:55.430> the<00:01:55.520> same<00:01:55.730> position<00:01:56.300> and<00:01:56.480> finishes

00:01:57.400 --> 00:01:57.410 
starts in the same position and finishes

00:01:57.410 --> 00:02:04.660 
starts in the same position and finishes
in<00:01:57.590> the<00:01:57.680> same<00:01:57.890> position<00:02:03.370> play<00:02:04.370> the<00:02:04.520> ball

00:02:04.660 --> 00:02:04.670 
in the same position play the ball

00:02:04.670 --> 00:02:07.810 
in the same position play the ball
faster<00:02:05.300> all<00:02:05.600> Jeff<00:02:05.960> needs<00:02:06.230> to<00:02:06.380> do<00:02:06.530> now<00:02:06.560> is<00:02:07.250> to

00:02:07.810 --> 00:02:07.820 
faster all Jeff needs to do now is to

00:02:07.820 --> 00:02:10.389 
faster all Jeff needs to do now is to
just<00:02:07.850> speed<00:02:08.510> up<00:02:08.540> the<00:02:08.960> stroke<00:02:09.260> get<00:02:10.100> the<00:02:10.250> bat

00:02:10.389 --> 00:02:10.399 
just speed up the stroke get the bat

00:02:10.399 --> 00:02:13.000 
just speed up the stroke get the bat
going<00:02:10.760> faster<00:02:11.540> from<00:02:11.750> the<00:02:11.930> start<00:02:12.230> to<00:02:12.890> the

00:02:13.000 --> 00:02:13.010 
going faster from the start to the

00:02:13.010 --> 00:02:20.560 
going faster from the start to the
finish<00:02:16.750> and<00:02:18.580> if<00:02:19.580> he<00:02:19.670> wants<00:02:19.880> to<00:02:19.970> play<00:02:20.150> it<00:02:20.270> slower

00:02:20.560 --> 00:02:20.570 
finish and if he wants to play it slower

00:02:20.570 --> 00:02:27.520 
finish and if he wants to play it slower
he<00:02:21.140> moves<00:02:21.380> his<00:02:21.500> back<00:02:21.740> through<00:02:21.980> slower<00:02:26.530> by

00:02:27.520 --> 00:02:27.530 
he moves his back through slower by

00:02:27.530 --> 00:02:29.860 
he moves his back through slower by
having<00:02:27.920> this<00:02:28.100> basic<00:02:28.640> stroke<00:02:28.970> you'll<00:02:29.600> be<00:02:29.780> able

00:02:29.860 --> 00:02:29.870 
having this basic stroke you'll be able

00:02:29.870 --> 00:02:32.080 
having this basic stroke you'll be able
to<00:02:30.080> play<00:02:30.260> the<00:02:30.440> ball<00:02:30.620> at<00:02:30.830> any<00:02:31.040> speed<00:02:31.640> that<00:02:31.880> you

to play the ball at any speed that you
want<00:02:32.330> to<00:02:34.240> so<00:02:35.240> there<00:02:35.480> are<00:02:35.540> a<00:02:35.570> couple<00:02:35.690> of<00:02:35.840> things

00:02:36.010 --> 00:02:36.020 
want to so there are a couple of things

00:02:36.020 --> 00:02:38.410 
want to so there are a couple of things
that<00:02:36.170> I<00:02:36.290> often<00:02:36.560> see<00:02:36.950> players<00:02:37.310> do<00:02:37.700> when<00:02:38.210> they're

00:02:38.410 --> 00:02:38.420 
that I often see players do when they're

learning the forehand counterhit one
common<00:02:41.660> error<00:02:41.930> is<00:02:42.200> that<00:02:42.650> they<00:02:42.830> swing<00:02:43.250> too<00:02:44.030> low
