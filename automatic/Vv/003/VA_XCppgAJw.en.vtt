00:00:26.000 --> 00:00:35.690
 Oh yeah, I'll try to learn basic waves at the time 

00:00:30.680 --> 00:00:39.110
 I do not know if I can explain Wave regularly. 

00:00:35.690 --> 00:00:45.290
 It's a pretty romance for those who just did not dance a lot. 

00:00:39.110 --> 00:00:48.590

00:00:50.809 --> 00:00:57.620
 No , move one by one from top to bottom, from bottom to top 

00:00:55.760 --> 00:01:02.329
 Moving steps 

00:00:57.620 --> 00:01:04.879
 I thought connecting Steps Wave is literally turned this bend 

00:01:02.329 --> 00:01:08.210
 That's nine of those waves . 

00:01:04.879 --> 00:01:09.290
 I've done a lot of things in the simplest way. 

00:01:08.210 --> 00:01:13.700
 Easily touch your 

00:01:09.290 --> 00:01:18.800
 Once I see my head back in the first place. 

00:01:13.700 --> 00:01:23.690
 Pull the chin out of Las . Your belly will come forward as you pull your chin. 

00:01:18.800 --> 00:01:27.680
 Then the knee while the belly is pulled out of the state 

00:01:23.690 --> 00:01:31.040
 Bend down to us again it will be a 10 

00:01:27.680 --> 00:01:33.200
 Of course you can come up in the opposite direction. 

00:01:31.040 --> 00:01:36.110
 You put off the bell. 

00:01:33.200 --> 00:01:41.420

 Easy, Yes indeed this is gonna be one important one is now sure that this operation 

00:01:41.420 --> 00:01:49.400
 Why should this be done? 

00:01:45.680 --> 00:01:53.900
 The most important parts of the upper body that I can not solve 

00:01:49.400 --> 00:01:58.490
 This is how it works. Later on, I have a lot of exercise called upper body separation . 

00:01:53.900 --> 00:01:59.720
 If you do so in the chest area , remove the middle part of the patch. 

00:01:58.490 --> 00:02:06.350
 When you do 

00:01:59.720 --> 00:02:09.560
 Many live just across a lot is riding a wave dividing simyeon 

00:02:06.350 --> 00:02:12.079
 My first simple wave 

00:02:09.560 --> 00:02:16.700
 Please open your head to Ransom. 

00:02:12.079 --> 00:02:18.680
 Then pull the nine and pray for the belly, and then bend your knees 

00:02:16.700 --> 00:02:22.340
 Give me a heap 

00:02:18.680 --> 00:02:25.370
 Do not pull it out to the top. 9 

00:02:22.340 --> 00:02:31.190
 So, coming back in the opposite direction is equally opposite 

00:02:25.370 --> 00:02:33.120
 1 9 Lift your knee, then your chin will go up and you will see the front. 

00:02:31.190 --> 00:02:36.180
 Yes, this way. 

00:02:33.120 --> 00:02:40.170
 Thoused Fo 

00:02:36.180 --> 00:02:43.230
 Two Three Four'll come in a complete 

00:02:40.170 --> 00:02:46.290
 Once again, I do it's finished 

00:02:43.230 --> 00:02:51.150
 Then, 

00:02:46.290 --> 00:02:55.110
 John Pollock back then as the protection and distressed, so dividing the circle-to-three-PO 

00:02:51.150 --> 00:02:59.040
 1 2 3 

00:02:55.110 --> 00:03:04.739
 We have to practice slowly to the correct position and then 2 

00:02:59.040 --> 00:03:10.440
 2 3 4 If you practice this part of contrasts constantly Connect Connect 

00:03:04.739 --> 00:03:16.980
 If you move the connection, you will get the outside you want. 

00:03:10.440 --> 00:03:20.760
 That's why we continue to keep who did the exercises if it connects to 

00:03:16.980 --> 00:03:24.690
 If I eat it, I will not be in college, and I will make it as it is. 

00:03:20.760 --> 00:03:29.310
 It's amazing . Maybe if it happens, it's all slowly counting. 

00:03:24.690 --> 00:03:30.390
 You practice again one by one. So practice in that way. 

00:03:29.310 --> 00:03:34.140
 Please 

00:03:30.390 --> 00:03:38.220
 Later on, this will go to the body as a waste link. 

00:03:34.140 --> 00:03:41.620
 So once when the practice is now held up his head, so there is some 

00:03:38.220 --> 00:03:45.310
 When you are close enough, 

00:03:41.620 --> 00:03:49.959
 Body 5 Under the neck 

00:03:45.310 --> 00:03:55.060
 Doeguyo feel free to write me a wave if the hair in practice as head saenggyeoyo 

00:03:49.959 --> 00:03:58.690
 This is how you do it. 

00:03:55.060 --> 00:04:03.849
 So it sounded so loud when I practiced , 

00:03:58.690 --> 00:04:04.750
 When women do this, they turn their jaws around when they are in the body. 

00:04:03.849 --> 00:04:10.930
 You got it. 

00:04:04.750 --> 00:04:12.400
 As I practiced my Qingdao, I pulled out and pulled out the boat and bent my knees 

00:04:10.930 --> 00:04:16.570
 Next comes the power 

00:04:12.400 --> 00:04:21.010
 Simyeon is'll ride the wave like this 

00:04:16.570 --> 00:04:22.150
 Then I eat a lot of out there is a little like this wave or something 

00:04:21.010 --> 00:04:27.310
 The boxes are the same. 

00:04:22.150 --> 00:04:28.360
 These waves come in. So when you're in the first place, 

00:04:27.310 --> 00:04:35.050
 I told you. 

00:04:28.360 --> 00:04:36.039
 Wave 1 2 3 4 Dead Do not count and count as 1 2 3 4 2 2 

00:04:35.050 --> 00:04:42.120
 3 4 

00:04:36.039 --> 00:04:48.250
 Slowly he practiced each one operates the operation before the transition area Connect 

00:04:42.120 --> 00:04:52.300
 This is the feeling that keeps connecting continuously and going down and connecting steadily 

00:04:48.250 --> 00:04:57.430
 Can continue to look to repeat the exercise is to the body naturally, but baeya shop 

00:04:52.300 --> 00:05:00.160
 It's a natural thing to do. 

00:04:57.430 --> 00:05:05.289
 If you practice for about 10 minutes 

00:05:00.160 --> 00:05:07.539
 I think that no matter how still hit a bunch thing not just have one month time 

00:05:05.289 --> 00:05:11.979
 I think it's possible to have enough surgery inside. 

00:05:07.539 --> 00:05:14.280
 I hope that you have the facts and try the challenge. 

00:05:11.979 --> 00:05:14.280
 Bye
