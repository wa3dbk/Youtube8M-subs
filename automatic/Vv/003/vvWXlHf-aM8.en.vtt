00:00:22.900 --> 00:00:22.910 
organic apples that are underneath I've

00:00:22.910 --> 00:00:27.040 
organic apples that are underneath I've
put<00:00:23.270> the<00:00:23.890> greater<00:00:24.890> oranges<00:00:25.580> on<00:00:25.760> top<00:00:26.029> I<00:00:26.360> peeled

00:00:27.040 --> 00:00:27.050 
put the greater oranges on top I peeled

00:00:27.050 --> 00:00:30.429 
put the greater oranges on top I peeled
one<00:00:27.380> of<00:00:27.529> them<00:00:27.680> partially<00:00:28.840> so<00:00:29.840> they<00:00:29.960> can<00:00:30.169> smell

00:00:30.429 --> 00:00:30.439 
one of them partially so they can smell

00:00:30.439 --> 00:00:32.440 
one of them partially so they can smell
it<00:00:30.680> I<00:00:30.860> think<00:00:31.489> one<00:00:31.610> of<00:00:31.730> the<00:00:31.790> reasons<00:00:32.150> that<00:00:32.210> they

00:00:32.440 --> 00:00:32.450 
it I think one of the reasons that they

00:00:32.450 --> 00:00:34.300 
it I think one of the reasons that they
went<00:00:32.630> for<00:00:32.810> the<00:00:32.870> apples<00:00:33.290> as<00:00:33.440> they<00:00:33.590> smell<00:00:33.920> really

00:00:34.300 --> 00:00:34.310 
went for the apples as they smell really

00:00:34.310 --> 00:00:36.910 
went for the apples as they smell really
good<00:00:34.700> so<00:00:35.480> now<00:00:35.630> they'll<00:00:35.810> be<00:00:35.870> able<00:00:35.989> to<00:00:36.260> smell<00:00:36.739> the

00:00:36.910 --> 00:00:36.920 
good so now they'll be able to smell the

00:00:36.920 --> 00:00:39.729 
good so now they'll be able to smell the

00:01:12.590 --> 00:01:15.219 
up there in the tree and I'll come back
in<00:01:12.770> a<00:01:12.860> few<00:01:13.040> days<00:01:13.220> and<00:01:13.640> see<00:01:14.569> what's<00:01:14.780> happening

00:03:19.400 --> 00:03:19.410 
I left it propped up in the tree here

00:03:19.410 --> 00:03:23.420 
I left it propped up in the tree here
and<00:03:20.150> it<00:03:21.150> doesn't<00:03:21.540> look<00:03:21.690> like<00:03:22.190> any<00:03:23.190> of<00:03:23.280> the

00:03:23.420 --> 00:03:23.430

00:03:37.230 --> 00:03:41.990 
had it wedged up in there pretty well it
is<00:03:37.470> now<00:03:37.740> here<00:03:38.100> on<00:03:38.220> the<00:03:38.340> ground<00:03:38.700> and<00:03:40.700> it<00:03:41.700> doesn't

00:03:43.650 --> 00:03:44.330 
appear that any of this stuff's been
moved

00:03:44.330 --> 00:03:44.340 
moved

00:03:44.340 --> 00:03:46.370 
moved
I'll<00:03:44.700> have<00:03:45.120> to<00:03:45.240> take<00:03:45.420> a<00:03:45.480> picture<00:03:45.900> of<00:03:46.020> the<00:03:46.140> rocks

00:03:46.370 --> 00:03:46.380 
I'll have to take a picture of the rocks

00:03:46.380 --> 00:03:50.300 
I'll have to take a picture of the rocks
and<00:03:48.050> see<00:03:49.050> if<00:03:49.140> they're<00:03:49.590> the<00:03:49.710> same<00:03:49.740> as<00:03:50.130> they<00:03:50.280> are

00:03:50.300 --> 00:03:50.310 
and see if they're the same as they are

00:03:50.310 --> 00:03:56.780 
and see if they're the same as they are
now<00:03:50.990> so<00:03:53.180> over<00:03:54.180> here<00:03:54.770> the<00:03:55.770> oranges<00:03:56.310> that<00:03:56.340> I<00:03:56.520> left

00:03:56.780 --> 00:03:56.790 
now so over here the oranges that I left

00:03:56.790 --> 00:04:00.440 
now so over here the oranges that I left
on<00:03:56.970> the<00:03:57.090> ground<00:03:57.270> are<00:03:57.930> gone<00:03:58.880> there<00:03:59.880> are<00:04:00.060> some

00:04:00.440 --> 00:04:00.450 
on the ground are gone there are some

00:04:00.450 --> 00:04:03.980 
on the ground are gone there are some
fresh<00:04:00.720> tracks<00:04:01.020> here<00:04:01.710> but<00:04:02.670> between<00:04:03.660> the<00:04:03.780> leaves

00:04:03.980 --> 00:04:03.990 
fresh tracks here but between the leaves

00:04:03.990 --> 00:04:07.640 
fresh tracks here but between the leaves
and<00:04:04.380> the<00:04:04.470> Duff<00:04:05.090> there's<00:04:06.090> not<00:04:06.360> really<00:04:06.650> anything

00:04:07.640 --> 00:04:07.650 
and the Duff there's not really anything

00:04:07.650 --> 00:04:11.480 
and the Duff there's not really anything
to<00:04:07.950> say<00:04:08.820> for<00:04:08.850> sure<00:04:09.740> there's<00:04:10.740> some<00:04:10.980> elk<00:04:11.190> poop

00:04:11.480 --> 00:04:11.490 
to say for sure there's some elk poop

00:04:11.490 --> 00:04:14.660 
to say for sure there's some elk poop
but<00:04:11.730> that's<00:04:11.940> old<00:04:12.860> so<00:04:13.860> I'm<00:04:13.920> not<00:04:14.040> really<00:04:14.250> seeing

00:04:14.660 --> 00:04:14.670 
but that's old so I'm not really seeing

00:04:14.670 --> 00:04:18.920 
but that's old so I'm not really seeing
hoof<00:04:15.210> marks<00:04:15.650> or<00:04:16.790> footprints<00:04:17.790> nope<00:04:18.600> there's

00:04:18.920 --> 00:04:18.930 
hoof marks or footprints nope there's

00:04:18.930 --> 00:04:22.520 
hoof marks or footprints nope there's
hoof<00:04:19.230> marks<00:04:19.500> right<00:04:20.340> there<00:04:20.870> so<00:04:21.870> I<00:04:22.320> would

00:04:22.520 --> 00:04:22.530 
hoof marks right there so I would

00:04:22.530 --> 00:04:24.230 
hoof marks right there so I would
suspect<00:04:22.860> this<00:04:23.340> might<00:04:23.550> have<00:04:23.760> been<00:04:23.790> the<00:04:24.030> elk

00:04:24.230 --> 00:04:24.240 
suspect this might have been the elk

00:04:24.240 --> 00:04:26.330 
suspect this might have been the elk
that<00:04:24.360> took<00:04:24.750> the<00:04:24.930> oranges<00:04:25.530> off<00:04:25.710> the<00:04:25.890> ground<00:04:26.130> you

00:04:26.330 --> 00:04:26.340 
that took the oranges off the ground you

00:04:26.340 --> 00:04:29.440 
that took the oranges off the ground you
can<00:04:26.490> see<00:04:26.670> there's<00:04:26.880> a<00:04:27.000> few<00:04:27.210> peels<00:04:28.200> left<00:04:28.620> here

00:04:29.440 --> 00:04:29.450 
can see there's a few peels left here

00:04:29.450 --> 00:04:32.210 
can see there's a few peels left here
yeah<00:04:30.450> that<00:04:30.900> kind<00:04:31.170> of<00:04:31.200> looks<00:04:31.380> like<00:04:31.470> an<00:04:31.740> old<00:04:31.830> mark

00:04:32.210 --> 00:04:32.220

00:07:28.800 --> 00:07:28.810 
highway right there it would be pretty

00:07:28.810 --> 00:07:32.100 
highway right there it would be pretty
