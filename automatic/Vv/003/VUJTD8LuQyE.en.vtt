00:01:44.749 --> 00:01:44.759 
in the system basically so you don't

00:01:44.759 --> 00:01:45.710 
in the system basically so you don't
even<00:01:45.090> want<00:01:45.270> to

00:01:45.710 --> 00:01:45.720 
even want to

00:01:45.720 --> 00:01:49.160

credit<00:01:51.380> but<00:01:52.380> what<00:01:52.560> the<00:01:52.710> reason<00:01:53.040> for<00:01:53.280> that<00:01:53.310> was

00:01:53.420 --> 00:01:53.430 
credit but what the reason for that was

00:01:53.430 --> 00:01:56.450 
credit but what the reason for that was
because<00:01:53.810> there<00:01:54.810> was<00:01:54.930> a<00:01:54.990> rumor<00:01:55.410> that<00:01:55.440> they<00:01:55.830> it
