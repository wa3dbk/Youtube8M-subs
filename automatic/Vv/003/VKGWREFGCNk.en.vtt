00:00:15.410 --> 00:00:15.420 
as to keep it from bubbling up on the

00:00:15.420 --> 00:00:18.109 
as to keep it from bubbling up on the
bottom<00:00:15.839> so<00:00:16.830> once<00:00:17.010> you've<00:00:17.160> got<00:00:17.310> that<00:00:17.490> done<00:00:17.730> you

bottom so once you've got that done you

00:00:18.119 --> 00:00:20.090 
bottom so once you've got that done you
take<00:00:18.359> the<00:00:18.510> pie<00:00:18.690> crust<00:00:18.750> and<00:00:19.350> you<00:00:19.439> put<00:00:19.650> it<00:00:19.770> in<00:00:19.949> the

00:00:22.279 --> 00:00:22.289 
oven this is the most important part

00:00:22.289 --> 00:00:27.070 
oven this is the most important part

00:00:27.070 --> 00:00:27.080 
because the pie crust has to be cooked a

00:00:27.080 --> 00:00:29.390 
because the pie crust has to be cooked a
little<00:00:28.080> bit<00:00:28.260> because<00:00:28.500> if<00:00:28.859> you<00:00:29.010> set<00:00:29.250> the

00:00:29.390 --> 00:00:29.400 
little bit because if you set the

00:00:29.400 --> 00:00:31.550 
little bit because if you set the
tomatoes<00:00:29.939> and<00:00:30.269> the<00:00:30.630> ingredients<00:00:31.260> in<00:00:31.380> there
