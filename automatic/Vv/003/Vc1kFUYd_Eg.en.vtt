 the cable on your iphone and ipad is important 

00:00:28.050 --> 00:00:33.480
 which were positive for others 

00:00:29.910 --> 00:00:36.809
 You use there what you have made of apple. 

00:00:33.480 --> 00:00:39.719
 ok I have not tested with other products and 

00:00:36.809 --> 00:00:40.680
 works if you have android and tested 

00:00:39.719 --> 00:00:42.420

00:00:40.680 --> 00:00:44.489

00:00:42.420 --> 00:00:46.440
 video but here he is speaking here he 

00:00:44.489 --> 00:00:50.610
 works only with iphone ipad and 

00:00:46.440 --> 00:00:54.690
 important will connect usb then in your 

00:00:50.610 --> 00:00:57.570
 iphone on your mac or computer and here 

00:00:54.690 --> 00:00:58.949
 it will look for a space that is 

00:00:57.570 --> 00:01:02.660
 being used 

00:00:58.949 --> 00:01:10.670
 ok in case it has 39 points 0 7 gigabytes 

00:01:02.660 --> 00:01:13.580
 being used in only 20 free 

00:01:10.670 --> 00:01:15.900
 again showing the ability and 

00:01:13.580 --> 00:01:19.380
 shows how much the example I have 

00:01:15.900 --> 00:01:22.350
 that 33 percent of free space on my 

00:01:19.380 --> 00:01:25.470
 and we will give a scania nothing to 

00:01:22.350 --> 00:01:28.860
 wonder and will see how much space 

00:01:25.470 --> 00:01:32.280
 used in useless things in things 

00:01:28.860 --> 00:01:35.369
 that they do not need to have in my 

00:01:32.280 --> 00:01:38.369
 iphone is very good for who owns 

00:01:35.369 --> 00:01:41.340
 iphone in major loss of 16 gigs and 

00:01:38.369 --> 00:01:42.810
 does not have much space is very humble 

00:01:41.340 --> 00:01:46.740
 very useful if you use this application 

00:01:42.810 --> 00:01:50.130
 for you to free up space in your neighborhood 

00:01:46.740 --> 00:01:53.729
 and there is that one then showed more or 

00:01:50.130 --> 00:01:56.280

00:01:53.729 --> 00:02:02.549
 iphone and unusable she's only here 

00:01:56.280 --> 00:02:05.869

00:02:02.549 --> 00:02:09.210
 useless things from my mobile 

00:02:05.869 --> 00:02:11.220
 applications is anything else 

00:02:09.210 --> 00:02:14.870

00:02:19.500 --> 00:02:25.440
 the hypothesis of these things that are not 

00:02:22.890 --> 00:02:28.140
 necessary will take ok only takes up a space 

00:02:25.440 --> 00:02:31.650
 here with it asks you to share 

00:02:28.140 --> 00:02:33.900
 because so many doctors have to 

00:02:31.650 --> 00:02:36.810
