i'm going to show you how to increase
the<00:00:19.320> speed<00:00:19.590> of<00:00:19.650> your<00:00:20.009> iDevice<00:00:20.599> significantly

00:00:21.589 --> 00:00:21.599 
the speed of your iDevice significantly

00:00:21.599 --> 00:00:23.900 
the speed of your iDevice significantly
now<00:00:22.439> there<00:00:22.860> are<00:00:22.950> three<00:00:23.250> methods<00:00:23.460> that<00:00:23.790> i'm

00:00:23.900 --> 00:00:23.910 
now there are three methods that i'm

00:00:23.910 --> 00:00:25.130 
now there are three methods that i'm
going<00:00:24.029> to<00:00:24.090> be<00:00:24.150> talking<00:00:24.419> to<00:00:24.720> you<00:00:24.779> guys<00:00:24.900> about

00:00:25.130 --> 00:00:25.140 
going to be talking to you guys about

00:00:25.140 --> 00:00:27.529 
going to be talking to you guys about
today<00:00:25.290> and<00:00:25.860> as<00:00:26.490> some<00:00:26.669> of<00:00:26.759> you<00:00:26.849> may<00:00:27.029> remember<00:00:27.090> i

today and as some of you may remember i
did<00:00:27.960> a<00:00:27.990> video<00:00:28.230> on<00:00:28.380> how<00:00:28.650> to<00:00:28.680> do<00:00:28.949> this<00:00:29.130> a<00:00:29.189> while

00:00:29.480 --> 00:00:29.490 
did a video on how to do this a while

00:00:29.490 --> 00:00:31.339 
did a video on how to do this a while
back<00:00:29.760> but<00:00:29.970> i<00:00:30.060> didn't<00:00:30.330> go<00:00:30.449> as<00:00:30.599> in-depth<00:00:31.019> as<00:00:31.170> i

00:00:31.339 --> 00:00:31.349 
back but i didn't go as in-depth as i

00:00:31.349 --> 00:00:33.710 
back but i didn't go as in-depth as i
would<00:00:31.650> have<00:00:31.680> liked<00:00:31.980> to<00:00:32.160> but<00:00:33.059> now<00:00:33.300> i'm<00:00:33.420> gonna<00:00:33.600> go

00:00:33.710 --> 00:00:33.720 
would have liked to but now i'm gonna go

00:00:33.720 --> 00:00:35.509 
would have liked to but now i'm gonna go
more<00:00:33.930> into<00:00:34.110> depth<00:00:34.410> on<00:00:34.620> that<00:00:34.680> and<00:00:35.160> i'm<00:00:35.340> going<00:00:35.460> to

00:00:35.509 --> 00:00:35.519 
more into depth on that and i'm going to

00:00:35.519 --> 00:00:37.369 
more into depth on that and i'm going to
give<00:00:35.640> you<00:00:35.670> an<00:00:35.850> additional<00:00:36.120> thing<00:00:37.110> that<00:00:37.170> you

00:00:37.369 --> 00:00:37.379 
give you an additional thing that you

00:00:37.379 --> 00:00:39.380 
give you an additional thing that you
can<00:00:37.530> do<00:00:37.650> to<00:00:37.800> increase<00:00:37.949> the<00:00:38.580> RAM<00:00:38.850> on<00:00:39.180> your

00:00:39.380 --> 00:00:39.390 
can do to increase the RAM on your

00:00:39.390 --> 00:00:41.479 
can do to increase the RAM on your
iDevice<00:00:39.620> so<00:00:40.620> the<00:00:40.739> first<00:00:40.949> method<00:00:41.160> is<00:00:41.430> by

00:00:41.479 --> 00:00:41.489 
iDevice so the first method is by

00:00:41.489 --> 00:00:42.590 
iDevice so the first method is by
deleting<00:00:42.000> Damon's

00:00:42.590 --> 00:00:42.600 
deleting Damon's

00:00:42.600 --> 00:00:44.720 
deleting Damon's
now<00:00:43.080> Damon's<00:00:43.710> our<00:00:43.829> little<00:00:44.040> processes<00:00:44.579> that

00:00:44.720 --> 00:00:44.730 
now Damon's our little processes that

00:00:44.730 --> 00:00:47.479 
now Damon's our little processes that
start<00:00:45.149> up<00:00:45.329> with<00:00:45.750> your<00:00:46.020> iPhone<00:00:46.530> or<00:00:46.800> iPod<00:00:47.250> Touch

00:00:47.479 --> 00:00:47.489 
start up with your iPhone or iPod Touch

00:00:47.489 --> 00:00:51.200 
start up with your iPhone or iPod Touch
or<00:00:47.730> iPad<00:00:48.079> that<00:00:49.079> can<00:00:49.649> be<00:00:50.160> a<00:00:50.489> little<00:00:50.850> tricky

00:00:51.200 --> 00:00:51.210 
or iPad that can be a little tricky

00:00:51.210 --> 00:00:54.440 
or iPad that can be a little tricky
because<00:00:51.570> a<00:00:52.440> lot<00:00:53.129> of<00:00:53.280> them<00:00:53.430> you<00:00:53.579> don't<00:00:53.760> need<00:00:54.059> and

00:00:54.440 --> 00:00:54.450 
because a lot of them you don't need and

00:00:54.450 --> 00:00:56.869 
because a lot of them you don't need and
you<00:00:54.930> can<00:00:55.079> disable<00:00:55.410> them<00:00:55.739> and<00:00:56.010> so<00:00:56.640> they<00:00:56.760> don't

00:00:56.869 --> 00:00:56.879 
you can disable them and so they don't

00:00:56.879 --> 00:00:58.970 
you can disable them and so they don't
start<00:00:57.210> up<00:00:57.390> along<00:00:57.690> with<00:00:57.719> your<00:00:58.110> iDevice<00:00:58.559> but<00:00:58.860> as

00:00:58.970 --> 00:00:58.980 
start up along with your iDevice but as

00:00:58.980 --> 00:01:01.130 
start up along with your iDevice but as
soon<00:00:59.160> as<00:00:59.309> you<00:00:59.399> like<00:00:59.579> for<00:01:00.120> instance<00:01:00.239> open<00:01:01.020> the

00:01:01.130 --> 00:01:01.140 
soon as you like for instance open the

00:01:01.140 --> 00:01:04.160 
soon as you like for instance open the
phone<00:01:01.410> or<00:01:01.800> open<00:01:02.489> on<00:01:02.730> Safari<00:01:03.270> it'll<00:01:03.719> start<00:01:04.050> it

00:01:04.160 --> 00:01:04.170 
phone or open on Safari it'll start it

00:01:04.170 --> 00:01:07.370 
phone or open on Safari it'll start it
up<00:01:04.289> then<00:01:04.649> it<00:01:05.520> just<00:01:05.700> won't<00:01:05.910> load<00:01:06.060> as<00:01:06.270> fast<00:01:06.330> but<00:01:07.320> I

00:01:07.370 --> 00:01:07.380 
up then it just won't load as fast but I

00:01:07.380 --> 00:01:09.889 
up then it just won't load as fast but I
definitely<00:01:08.250> recommend<00:01:08.640> disabling<00:01:09.000> all<00:01:09.750> the

00:01:09.889 --> 00:01:09.899 
definitely recommend disabling all the

00:01:09.899 --> 00:01:12.680 
definitely recommend disabling all the
Damons<00:01:10.229> you<00:01:10.350> can<00:01:10.619> because<00:01:11.190> it<00:01:11.700> will<00:01:12.119> increase

00:01:12.680 --> 00:01:12.690 
Damons you can because it will increase

00:01:12.690 --> 00:01:15.889 
Damons you can because it will increase
your<00:01:13.050> RAM<00:01:13.470> significantly<00:01:14.250> so<00:01:15.030> in<00:01:15.360> order<00:01:15.479> to<00:01:15.630> be

00:01:15.889 --> 00:01:15.899 
your RAM significantly so in order to be

00:01:15.899 --> 00:01:23.810 
your RAM significantly so in order to be
that<00:01:16.170> method<00:01:16.679> just<00:01:17.310> click<00:01:17.729> on<00:01:17.970> the<00:01:18.630> bubble

00:01:23.810 --> 00:01:23.820 

00:01:23.820 --> 00:01:25.880 

so<00:01:24.540> now<00:01:24.660> the<00:01:24.720> second<00:01:25.200> method<00:01:25.320> would<00:01:25.680> be<00:01:25.740> to

00:01:25.880 --> 00:01:25.890 
so now the second method would be to

00:01:25.890 --> 00:01:29.420 
so now the second method would be to
delete<00:01:26.580> all<00:01:26.790> useless<00:01:27.420> language<00:01:28.110> packs<00:01:28.440> so<00:01:29.250> now

00:01:29.420 --> 00:01:29.430 
delete all useless language packs so now

00:01:29.430 --> 00:01:31.430 
delete all useless language packs so now
language<00:01:29.910> packs<00:01:30.210> are<00:01:30.540> basically<00:01:30.960> just<00:01:31.230> things

00:01:31.430 --> 00:01:31.440 
language packs are basically just things

00:01:31.440 --> 00:01:33.770 
language packs are basically just things
for<00:01:31.680> the<00:01:31.770> keyboard<00:01:32.340> like<00:01:33.000> spelling

00:01:33.770 --> 00:01:33.780 
for the keyboard like spelling

00:01:33.780 --> 00:01:36.080 
for the keyboard like spelling
Corrections<00:01:34.530> like<00:01:34.710> if<00:01:34.830> you<00:01:34.950> try<00:01:35.280> and<00:01:35.490> I<00:01:35.760> spell

00:01:36.080 --> 00:01:36.090 
Corrections like if you try and I spell

00:01:36.090 --> 00:01:38.150 
Corrections like if you try and I spell
Senor<00:01:36.600> it'll<00:01:36.900> fix<00:01:37.140> it<00:01:37.380> and<00:01:37.440> it'll<00:01:37.650> put<00:01:37.890> a

00:01:38.150 --> 00:01:38.160 
Senor it'll fix it and it'll put a

00:01:38.160 --> 00:01:41.600 
Senor it'll fix it and it'll put a
little<00:01:38.580> squiggly<00:01:38.970> thing<00:01:39.390> over<00:01:39.900> the<00:01:40.020> N<00:01:40.200> or<00:01:40.740> just

00:01:41.600 --> 00:01:41.610 
little squiggly thing over the N or just

00:01:41.610 --> 00:01:43.730 
little squiggly thing over the N or just
different<00:01:41.790> things<00:01:42.030> like<00:01:42.450> that<00:01:42.510> so<00:01:43.440> by

00:01:43.730 --> 00:01:43.740 
different things like that so by

00:01:43.740 --> 00:01:45.380 
different things like that so by
deleting<00:01:44.070> all<00:01:44.400> those<00:01:44.640> useless<00:01:44.880> language

00:01:45.380 --> 00:01:45.390 
deleting all those useless language

00:01:45.390 --> 00:01:48.469 
deleting all those useless language
packs<00:01:45.660> you<00:01:45.870> free<00:01:46.200> up<00:01:46.380> not<00:01:46.680> only<00:01:47.250> a<00:01:47.280> disk<00:01:48.060> space

00:01:48.469 --> 00:01:48.479 
packs you free up not only a disk space

00:01:48.479 --> 00:01:50.660 
packs you free up not only a disk space
but<00:01:48.810> you<00:01:48.900> also<00:01:49.080> free<00:01:49.530> up<00:01:49.650> some<00:01:49.860> RAM<00:01:50.190> as<00:01:50.460> well

00:01:50.660 --> 00:01:50.670 
but you also free up some RAM as well

00:01:50.670 --> 00:01:52.610 
but you also free up some RAM as well
and<00:01:51.000> it<00:01:51.120> makes<00:01:51.270> your<00:01:51.390> device<00:01:51.630> a<00:01:51.660> lot<00:01:51.900> smoother

00:01:52.610 --> 00:01:52.620 
and it makes your device a lot smoother

00:01:52.620 --> 00:01:55.910 
and it makes your device a lot smoother
so<00:01:53.310> I<00:01:53.729> definitely<00:01:53.940> recommend<00:01:54.660> that<00:01:54.920> however

00:01:55.910 --> 00:01:55.920 
so I definitely recommend that however

00:01:55.920 --> 00:01:58.160 
so I definitely recommend that however
there<00:01:56.160> is<00:01:56.340> a<00:01:56.369> trick<00:01:56.850> to<00:01:56.880> that<00:01:57.210> if<00:01:57.509> you're<00:01:58.050> on

00:01:58.160 --> 00:01:58.170 
there is a trick to that if you're on

00:01:58.170 --> 00:02:01.190 
there is a trick to that if you're on
4.0<00:01:58.830> or<00:01:59.040> if<00:01:59.160> you're<00:01:59.310> on<00:01:59.430> an<00:01:59.550> iPad<00:02:00.200> because

00:02:01.190 --> 00:02:01.200 
4.0 or if you're on an iPad because

00:02:01.200 --> 00:02:03.290 
4.0 or if you're on an iPad because
you'll<00:02:01.590> have<00:02:01.710> to<00:02:01.770> actually<00:02:02.280> manually<00:02:02.759> install

00:02:03.290 --> 00:02:03.300 
you'll have to actually manually install

00:02:03.300 --> 00:02:05.390 
you'll have to actually manually install
terminal<00:02:03.869> so<00:02:04.619> in<00:02:04.710> order<00:02:04.800> to<00:02:05.040> go<00:02:05.160> to<00:02:05.190> that

00:02:05.390 --> 00:02:05.400 
terminal so in order to go to that

00:02:05.400 --> 00:02:07.820 
terminal so in order to go to that
section<00:02:05.880> where<00:02:06.630> I<00:02:06.690> show<00:02:07.290> you<00:02:07.320> how<00:02:07.590> to<00:02:07.650> get

00:02:07.820 --> 00:02:07.830 
section where I show you how to get

00:02:07.830 --> 00:02:09.949 
section where I show you how to get
terminal<00:02:08.310> along<00:02:08.640> with<00:02:08.850> disabling<00:02:09.780> and

00:02:09.949 --> 00:02:09.959 
terminal along with disabling and

00:02:09.959 --> 00:02:12.020 
terminal along with disabling and
deleting<00:02:10.380> language<00:02:10.770> packs<00:02:11.070> just<00:02:11.700> click<00:02:11.880> in

00:02:12.020 --> 00:02:12.030 
deleting language packs just click in

00:02:12.030 --> 00:02:17.020 
deleting language packs just click in
the<00:02:12.120> bubble<00:02:12.390> and<00:02:12.480> you'll<00:02:12.600> be<00:02:12.690> taken<00:02:13.020> to<00:02:13.050> that

00:02:17.020 --> 00:02:17.030 

00:02:17.030 --> 00:02:19.820 

ok<00:02:18.030> so<00:02:18.090> now<00:02:18.360> the<00:02:18.420> last<00:02:18.690> one<00:02:18.959> is<00:02:19.290> somewhat

00:02:19.820 --> 00:02:19.830 
ok so now the last one is somewhat

00:02:19.830 --> 00:02:22.280 
ok so now the last one is somewhat
harmful<00:02:20.400> but<00:02:20.820> I<00:02:20.880> definitely<00:02:21.570> recommend<00:02:21.900> it<00:02:22.170> to

00:02:22.280 --> 00:02:22.290 
harmful but I definitely recommend it to

00:02:22.290 --> 00:02:25.280 
harmful but I definitely recommend it to
everyone<00:02:22.709> it<00:02:23.070> is<00:02:23.430> a<00:02:23.670> virtual<00:02:24.480> memory<00:02:24.840> mod

00:02:25.280 --> 00:02:25.290 
everyone it is a virtual memory mod

00:02:25.290 --> 00:02:28.130 
everyone it is a virtual memory mod
meaning<00:02:26.130> it<00:02:26.280> takes<00:02:26.310> part<00:02:26.940> of<00:02:27.060> your<00:02:27.209> I<00:02:27.239> devices

00:02:28.130 --> 00:02:28.140 
meaning it takes part of your I devices

00:02:28.140 --> 00:02:30.259 
meaning it takes part of your I devices
hard<00:02:28.380> disk<00:02:28.650> and<00:02:28.860> it<00:02:29.100> uses<00:02:29.310> that<00:02:29.550> as<00:02:29.730> RAM<00:02:30.000> it's

00:02:30.259 --> 00:02:30.269 
hard disk and it uses that as RAM it's

00:02:30.269 --> 00:02:32.750 
hard disk and it uses that as RAM it's
similar<00:02:30.480> to<00:02:30.630> a<00:02:30.750> paging<00:02:31.350> file<00:02:31.650> on<00:02:31.980> your

00:02:32.750 --> 00:02:32.760 
similar to a paging file on your

00:02:32.760 --> 00:02:35.180 
similar to a paging file on your
computer<00:02:32.840> so<00:02:33.840> basically<00:02:34.200> it<00:02:34.380> just<00:02:34.440> rewrites

00:02:35.180 --> 00:02:35.190 
computer so basically it just rewrites

00:02:35.190 --> 00:02:38.330 
computer so basically it just rewrites
rewrites<00:02:35.730> over<00:02:36.150> that<00:02:36.330> and<00:02:36.920> supposedly<00:02:37.920> most

00:02:38.330 --> 00:02:38.340 
rewrites over that and supposedly most

00:02:38.340 --> 00:02:41.840 
rewrites over that and supposedly most
people<00:02:38.760> say<00:02:39.030> that<00:02:39.780> over<00:02:40.560> 5<00:02:40.890> years<00:02:41.250> it<00:02:41.549> will

00:02:41.840 --> 00:02:41.850 
people say that over 5 years it will

00:02:41.850 --> 00:02:44.030 
people say that over 5 years it will
ruin<00:02:42.150> part<00:02:42.780> of<00:02:42.900> your<00:02:43.019> storage<00:02:43.320> on<00:02:43.620> your<00:02:43.650> device

00:02:44.030 --> 00:02:44.040 
ruin part of your storage on your device

00:02:44.040 --> 00:02:46.789 
ruin part of your storage on your device
but<00:02:44.280> it<00:02:45.090> hasn't<00:02:45.450> really<00:02:45.750> been<00:02:45.870> proven<00:02:46.440> so<00:02:46.769> I

00:02:46.789 --> 00:02:46.799 
but it hasn't really been proven so I

00:02:46.799 --> 00:02:48.259 
but it hasn't really been proven so I
doubt<00:02:47.190> you're<00:02:47.340> gonna<00:02:47.430> have<00:02:47.640> your<00:02:47.790> device<00:02:48.030> that

00:02:48.259 --> 00:02:48.269 
doubt you're gonna have your device that

00:02:48.269 --> 00:02:50.360 
doubt you're gonna have your device that
long<00:02:48.480> anyway<00:02:48.780> so<00:02:49.500> I<00:02:49.530> definitely<00:02:50.070> recommend

00:02:50.360 --> 00:02:50.370 
long anyway so I definitely recommend

00:02:50.370 --> 00:02:52.130 
long anyway so I definitely recommend
that<00:02:50.580> I<00:02:50.760> wouldn't<00:02:51.209> do<00:02:51.299> that<00:02:51.330> on<00:02:51.600> the<00:02:51.690> iPad

00:02:52.130 --> 00:02:52.140 
that I wouldn't do that on the iPad

00:02:52.140 --> 00:02:54.320 
that I wouldn't do that on the iPad
though<00:02:52.440> because<00:02:52.920> I<00:02:53.130> don't<00:02:53.610> think<00:02:53.760> it's<00:02:53.850> tested

00:02:54.320 --> 00:02:54.330 
though because I don't think it's tested

00:02:54.330 --> 00:02:56.420 
though because I don't think it's tested
with<00:02:54.480> the<00:02:54.510> iPad<00:02:55.049> I<00:02:55.380> think<00:02:55.830> that's<00:02:55.980> only<00:02:56.130> meant

00:02:56.420 --> 00:02:56.430 
with the iPad I think that's only meant

00:02:56.430 --> 00:02:58.100 
with the iPad I think that's only meant
for<00:02:56.489> the<00:02:56.700> iPhone<00:02:57.000> iPod<00:02:57.390> touch<00:02:57.600> but<00:02:57.630> knock

00:02:58.100 --> 00:02:58.110 
for the iPhone iPod touch but knock

00:02:58.110 --> 00:03:00.350 
for the iPhone iPod touch but knock
yourself<00:02:58.530> out<00:02:58.680> if<00:02:58.860> you<00:02:58.950> want<00:02:59.130> to<00:02:59.220> try<00:02:59.430> it<00:02:59.489> so

00:03:00.350 --> 00:03:00.360 
yourself out if you want to try it so

00:03:00.360 --> 00:03:01.759 
yourself out if you want to try it so
now<00:03:00.480> I<00:03:00.510> just<00:03:00.600> disabled<00:03:01.230> everything<00:03:01.560> that<00:03:01.680> was

00:03:01.759 --> 00:03:01.769 
now I just disabled everything that was

00:03:01.769 --> 00:03:03.800 
now I just disabled everything that was
running<00:03:01.950> in<00:03:02.100> the<00:03:02.130> background<00:03:02.400> i<00:03:03.180> freed<00:03:03.660> out

00:03:03.800 --> 00:03:03.810 
running in the background i freed out

00:03:03.810 --> 00:03:06.560 
running in the background i freed out
the<00:03:03.959> memory<00:03:04.350> and<00:03:04.560> I<00:03:05.010> have<00:03:05.040> about<00:03:05.430> 50<00:03:05.970> to<00:03:06.150> 51

00:03:06.560 --> 00:03:06.570 
the memory and I have about 50 to 51

00:03:06.570 --> 00:03:08.990 
the memory and I have about 50 to 51
megabytes<00:03:07.260> of<00:03:07.440> free<00:03:07.709> memory<00:03:07.920> so<00:03:08.310> just

00:03:08.990 --> 00:03:09.000 
megabytes of free memory so just

00:03:09.000 --> 00:03:11.300 
megabytes of free memory so just
remember<00:03:09.360> that<00:03:09.540> and<00:03:09.989> I'll<00:03:10.739> show<00:03:11.040> you<00:03:11.130> what<00:03:11.280> I

00:03:11.300 --> 00:03:11.310 
remember that and I'll show you what I

00:03:11.310 --> 00:03:13.370 
remember that and I'll show you what I
have<00:03:11.519> after<00:03:11.820> so<00:03:12.600> now<00:03:12.810> there<00:03:13.049> are<00:03:13.140> three

00:03:13.370 --> 00:03:13.380 
have after so now there are three

00:03:13.380 --> 00:03:15.020 
have after so now there are three
different<00:03:13.410> things<00:03:13.739> that<00:03:14.100> you<00:03:14.190> can<00:03:14.340> do<00:03:14.519> so

00:03:15.020 --> 00:03:15.030 
different things that you can do so

00:03:15.030 --> 00:03:16.820 
different things that you can do so
there<00:03:15.180> are<00:03:15.269> three<00:03:15.480> different<00:03:15.510> bubbles<00:03:16.019> one

00:03:16.820 --> 00:03:16.830 
there are three different bubbles one

00:03:16.830 --> 00:03:20.090 
there are three different bubbles one
would<00:03:17.340> be<00:03:17.489> disabling<00:03:18.060> Damons<00:03:18.540> two<00:03:19.110> would<00:03:19.920> be

00:03:20.090 --> 00:03:20.100 
would be disabling Damons two would be

00:03:20.100 --> 00:03:22.940 
would be disabling Damons two would be
disabling<00:03:20.760> and<00:03:21.390> deleting<00:03:22.049> language<00:03:22.620> packs

00:03:22.940 --> 00:03:22.950 
disabling and deleting language packs

00:03:22.950 --> 00:03:25.670 
disabling and deleting language packs
and<00:03:23.250> the<00:03:23.580> last<00:03:23.790> one<00:03:24.000> would<00:03:24.150> be<00:03:24.410> virtual<00:03:25.410> memory

00:03:25.670 --> 00:03:25.680 
and the last one would be virtual memory

00:03:25.680 --> 00:03:27.830 
and the last one would be virtual memory
so<00:03:26.160> just<00:03:26.820> click<00:03:27.030> into<00:03:27.239> the<00:03:27.450> bubble<00:03:27.690> that<00:03:27.720> you

00:03:27.830 --> 00:03:27.840 
so just click into the bubble that you

00:03:27.840 --> 00:03:29.660 
so just click into the bubble that you
want<00:03:28.080> to<00:03:28.230> go<00:03:28.410> to<00:03:28.470> and<00:03:28.830> you<00:03:29.010> will<00:03:29.160> be<00:03:29.280> taken<00:03:29.640> to

00:03:29.660 --> 00:03:29.670 
want to go to and you will be taken to

00:03:29.670 --> 00:03:32.180 
want to go to and you will be taken to
that<00:03:29.760> this<00:03:30.239> is<00:03:30.299> the<00:03:30.720> selection<00:03:31.140> part<00:03:31.620> so

00:03:32.180 --> 00:03:32.190 
that this is the selection part so

00:03:32.190 --> 00:03:37.590 
that this is the selection part so
obviously<00:03:32.730> you<00:03:32.820> can<00:03:32.970> just<00:03:33.150> select

00:03:37.590 --> 00:03:37.600 

00:03:37.600 --> 00:03:39.820 

so<00:03:38.600> I<00:03:38.630> hoped<00:03:38.930> you<00:03:39.020> guys<00:03:39.080> liked<00:03:39.380> this<00:03:39.530> video

00:03:41.290 --> 00:03:41.300 
hope you benefited from them

00:03:41.300 --> 00:03:45.190 
hope you benefited from them
