00:02:17.640 --> 00:02:21.110 
in the description reset so basically
what<00:02:17.910> you<00:02:18.000> do<00:02:18.180> for<00:02:18.680> to<00:02:19.680> add<00:02:19.800> sources<00:02:20.310> there

00:02:21.110 --> 00:02:21.120 
what you do for to add sources there

00:02:21.120 --> 00:02:24.260

00:02:34.490 --> 00:02:34.500 
because as you know city takes a long

00:02:34.500 --> 00:02:44.070 
because as you know city takes a long
time<00:02:34.530> to<00:02:35.030> load
