requests to do the chicken wire and
tutorial<00:00:07.830> that<00:00:08.610> I<00:00:08.639> thought<00:00:09.179> I<00:00:09.360> would<00:00:09.540> do<00:00:09.719> a

00:00:10.009 --> 00:00:10.019 
tutorial that I thought I would do a

00:00:10.019 --> 00:00:12.140 
tutorial that I thought I would do a
quick<00:00:10.410> video<00:00:10.590> on<00:00:10.950> my<00:00:11.250> cell<00:00:11.610> phone<00:00:11.639> and<00:00:11.969> show

00:00:12.140 --> 00:00:12.150 
quick video on my cell phone and show

00:00:12.150 --> 00:00:15.350 
quick video on my cell phone and show
you<00:00:12.210> how<00:00:12.450> it's<00:00:12.660> done<00:00:12.929> because<00:00:13.920> it's<00:00:14.219> easy<00:00:14.460> all

00:00:15.350 --> 00:00:15.360 
you how it's done because it's easy all

00:00:15.360 --> 00:00:21.529 
you how it's done because it's easy all
you<00:00:15.570> do<00:00:15.809> is<00:00:17.990> make<00:00:18.990> this<00:00:19.410> little<00:00:19.920> bracket<00:00:20.539> going

00:00:21.529 --> 00:00:21.539 
you do is make this little bracket going

00:00:21.539 --> 00:00:22.340 
you do is make this little bracket going
this<00:00:21.869> way

00:00:22.340 --> 00:00:22.350 
this way

00:00:22.350 --> 00:00:25.730 
this way
like<00:00:23.310> that<00:00:23.609> this<00:00:24.539> is<00:00:24.720> the<00:00:24.869> same<00:00:25.109> bracket<00:00:25.590> that

00:00:25.730 --> 00:00:25.740 
like that this is the same bracket that

00:00:25.740 --> 00:00:29.210 
like that this is the same bracket that
I<00:00:25.769> used<00:00:25.980> to<00:00:26.130> use<00:00:26.340> when<00:00:26.369> I<00:00:26.670> was<00:00:26.970> a<00:00:27.300> kid<00:00:28.019> and<00:00:28.349> we

00:00:29.210 --> 00:00:29.220 
I used to use when I was a kid and we

00:00:29.220 --> 00:00:31.310 
I used to use when I was a kid and we
had<00:00:29.400> to<00:00:29.550> like<00:00:29.730> write<00:00:30.090> a<00:00:30.119> grocery<00:00:30.660> list<00:00:30.689> or

00:00:31.310 --> 00:00:31.320 
had to like write a grocery list or

00:00:31.320 --> 00:00:33.889 
had to like write a grocery list or
whatever<00:00:31.710> and<00:00:32.009> then<00:00:32.550> we'd<00:00:32.759> go<00:00:33.000> like<00:00:33.329> that<00:00:33.600> and

00:00:33.889 --> 00:00:33.899 
whatever and then we'd go like that and

00:00:33.899 --> 00:00:38.420 
whatever and then we'd go like that and
write<00:00:34.410> veggies<00:00:35.210> or<00:00:36.210> whatever<00:00:37.129> I'm<00:00:38.129> just

00:00:38.420 --> 00:00:38.430 
write veggies or whatever I'm just

00:00:38.430 --> 00:00:41.959 
write veggies or whatever I'm just
connecting<00:00:38.730> a<00:00:39.059> bunch<00:00:39.270> of<00:00:39.420> them<00:00:40.489> so<00:00:41.489> you<00:00:41.550> just

00:00:41.959 --> 00:00:41.969 
connecting a bunch of them so you just

00:00:41.969 --> 00:00:46.600 
connecting a bunch of them so you just
do<00:00:42.360> the<00:00:42.510> same<00:00:42.750> thing<00:00:43.079> over<00:00:43.379> and<00:00:44.100> over<00:00:44.309> again

00:00:46.600 --> 00:00:46.610 
do the same thing over and over again

00:00:46.610 --> 00:00:53.479 
do the same thing over and over again
and<00:00:48.170> then<00:00:50.840> you<00:00:51.840> go<00:00:51.989> on<00:00:52.170> top<00:00:52.469> of<00:00:52.680> that<00:00:52.860> and<00:00:53.100> you

00:00:53.479 --> 00:00:53.489 
and then you go on top of that and you

00:00:53.489 --> 00:01:08.600 
and then you go on top of that and you
do<00:00:53.699> it<00:00:53.850> backwards

00:01:08.600 --> 00:01:08.610 

00:01:08.610 --> 00:01:11.480 

and<00:01:09.360> then<00:01:09.780> I<00:01:10.080> usually<00:01:10.260> put<00:01:10.800> a<00:01:10.830> little<00:01:11.190> dot

00:01:11.480 --> 00:01:11.490 
and then I usually put a little dot

00:01:11.490 --> 00:01:15.050 
and then I usually put a little dot
right<00:01:11.760> here<00:01:12.150> where<00:01:12.420> the<00:01:12.720> two<00:01:13.220> connect<00:01:14.220> just<00:01:14.940> to

00:01:15.050 --> 00:01:15.060 
right here where the two connect just to

00:01:15.060 --> 00:01:17.240 
right here where the two connect just to
cover<00:01:15.270> up<00:01:15.450> any<00:01:15.780> imperfections<00:01:16.740> there<00:01:16.980> where

00:01:17.240 --> 00:01:17.250 
cover up any imperfections there where

00:01:17.250 --> 00:01:20.600 
cover up any imperfections there where
they<00:01:17.430> meet<00:01:18.470> and<00:01:19.470> it<00:01:19.920> just<00:01:20.100> adds<00:01:20.280> a<00:01:20.400> little

00:01:20.600 --> 00:01:20.610 
they meet and it just adds a little

00:01:20.610 --> 00:01:25.750 
they meet and it just adds a little
something<00:01:21.030> to<00:01:21.300> the<00:01:21.800> pattern<00:01:22.800> itself<00:01:23.810> and

00:01:25.750 --> 00:01:25.760 
something to the pattern itself and

00:01:25.760 --> 00:01:29.270 
something to the pattern itself and
sometimes<00:01:26.760> I<00:01:27.180> will<00:01:27.420> put<00:01:27.720> a<00:01:28.280> little

00:01:29.270 --> 00:01:29.280 
sometimes I will put a little

00:01:29.280 --> 00:01:31.730 
sometimes I will put a little
embellishment<00:01:29.880> in<00:01:30.510> the<00:01:30.630> middle<00:01:30.930> here<00:01:31.410> like

00:01:31.730 --> 00:01:31.740 
embellishment in the middle here like

00:01:31.740 --> 00:01:35.740 
embellishment in the middle here like
that

00:01:35.740 --> 00:01:35.750 

00:01:35.750 --> 00:01:38.390 

but<00:01:36.750> that<00:01:36.930> is<00:01:37.110> it<00:01:37.290> that's<00:01:37.770> the<00:01:38.040> chicken-wire

00:01:38.390 --> 00:01:38.400 
but that is it that's the chicken-wire

00:01:38.400 --> 00:01:42.410 
but that is it that's the chicken-wire
tutorial<00:01:39.530> and<00:01:40.530> you<00:01:41.070> can<00:01:41.370> keep<00:01:41.880> adding<00:01:42.180> more

00:01:42.410 --> 00:01:42.420 
tutorial and you can keep adding more

00:01:42.420 --> 00:01:45.620 
tutorial and you can keep adding more
layers<00:01:43.229> and<00:01:43.979> make<00:01:44.280> it<00:01:44.490> as<00:01:44.670> large<00:01:45.030> as<00:01:45.420> you<00:01:45.600> want

00:01:45.620 --> 00:01:45.630 
layers and make it as large as you want

00:01:45.630 --> 00:01:56.540 
layers and make it as large as you want
just<00:01:49.700> over<00:01:50.700> and<00:01:51.120> over<00:01:51.270> and<00:01:51.960> over<00:01:52.350> again<00:01:55.550> there

00:01:56.540 --> 00:01:56.550 
just over and over and over again there
