hi<00:00:02.429> this<00:00:02.490> is<00:00:02.730> a<00:00:02.909> little<00:00:03.360> weird<00:00:03.659> problem<00:00:04.440> in<00:00:04.710> and

00:00:05.680 --> 00:00:05.690 
hi this is a little weird problem in and

00:00:05.690 --> 00:00:08.509 
hi this is a little weird problem in and
let<00:00:06.690> me<00:00:06.779> let<00:00:06.960> me<00:00:06.990> read<00:00:07.290> this<00:00:07.560> problem<00:00:07.890> to<00:00:08.370> you

00:00:08.509 --> 00:00:08.519 
let me let me read this problem to you

00:00:08.519 --> 00:00:10.940 
let me let me read this problem to you
so<00:00:08.880> well<00:00:09.630> we<00:00:09.750> don't<00:00:09.900> have<00:00:10.019> a<00:00:10.050> drawing<00:00:10.380> but<00:00:10.620> let

00:00:10.940 --> 00:00:10.950 
so well we don't have a drawing but let

00:00:10.950 --> 00:00:12.560 
so well we don't have a drawing but let
me<00:00:11.040> let<00:00:11.219> me<00:00:11.280> draw<00:00:11.580> it<00:00:11.610> real<00:00:11.969> quick<00:00:12.179> so<00:00:12.389> we<00:00:12.420> have

00:00:12.560 --> 00:00:12.570 
me let me draw it real quick so we have

00:00:12.570 --> 00:00:16.250 
me let me draw it real quick so we have
so<00:00:13.500> this<00:00:13.740> drawing<00:00:14.160> shows<00:00:14.460> a<00:00:14.880> circus<00:00:15.630> clown<00:00:15.839> is

00:00:16.250 --> 00:00:16.260 
so this drawing shows a circus clown is

00:00:16.260 --> 00:00:17.990 
so this drawing shows a circus clown is
going<00:00:16.440> to<00:00:16.529> be<00:00:16.800> represented<00:00:16.980> by<00:00:17.460> this<00:00:17.640> little

00:00:17.990 --> 00:00:18.000 
going to be represented by this little

00:00:18.000 --> 00:00:23.029 
going to be represented by this little
box<00:00:18.529> who<00:00:19.529> weighs<00:00:19.910> 840<00:00:20.910> Newtons<00:00:21.720> so<00:00:22.170> 800<00:00:22.500> whoa

00:00:23.029 --> 00:00:23.039 
box who weighs 840 Newtons so 800 whoa

00:00:23.039 --> 00:00:24.920 
box who weighs 840 Newtons so 800 whoa
yeah<00:00:23.519> let<00:00:23.699> me<00:00:23.730> just<00:00:24.000> let<00:00:24.150> me<00:00:24.240> just<00:00:24.420> write<00:00:24.630> it<00:00:24.810> in

00:00:24.920 --> 00:00:24.930 
yeah let me just let me just write it in

00:00:24.930 --> 00:00:28.490 
yeah let me just let me just write it in
here<00:00:25.170> so<00:00:25.350> 840<00:00:26.250> Newtons<00:00:26.699> the<00:00:27.660> coefficient<00:00:28.410> of

00:00:28.490 --> 00:00:28.500 
here so 840 Newtons the coefficient of

00:00:28.500 --> 00:00:30.679 
here so 840 Newtons the coefficient of
static<00:00:28.680> friction<00:00:29.010> between<00:00:29.580> the<00:00:29.939> clown's<00:00:30.269> feet

00:00:30.679 --> 00:00:30.689 
static friction between the clown's feet

00:00:30.689 --> 00:00:33.139 
static friction between the clown's feet
and<00:00:30.990> the<00:00:31.320> ground<00:00:31.590> so<00:00:32.099> there<00:00:32.250> is<00:00:32.340> a<00:00:32.369> ground<00:00:32.700> let

00:00:33.139 --> 00:00:33.149 
and the ground so there is a ground let

00:00:33.149 --> 00:00:36.049 
and the ground so there is a ground let
me<00:00:33.270> draw<00:00:33.450> the<00:00:33.510> ground<00:00:34.489> the<00:00:35.489> ground

00:00:36.049 --> 00:00:36.059 
me draw the ground the ground

00:00:36.059 --> 00:00:38.569 
me draw the ground the ground
I<00:00:36.180> can<00:00:36.899> draw<00:00:37.110> a<00:00:37.230> better<00:00:37.649> straight<00:00:38.040> line<00:00:38.309> than

00:00:38.569 --> 00:00:38.579 
I can draw a better straight line than

00:00:38.579 --> 00:00:41.680 
I can draw a better straight line than
that<00:00:38.790> so<00:00:39.180> okay<00:00:39.780> let<00:00:40.079> me<00:00:40.200> try<00:00:40.410> that<00:00:40.440> it<00:00:40.710> okay

00:00:41.680 --> 00:00:41.690 
that so okay let me try that it okay

00:00:41.690 --> 00:00:47.330 
that so okay let me try that it okay
okay<00:00:42.690> there<00:00:42.989> we<00:00:43.140> go<00:00:43.290> is<00:00:44.239> 0.5<00:00:45.239> 4<00:00:45.539> and<00:00:45.780> this<00:00:46.469> so<00:00:47.100> he

00:00:47.330 --> 00:00:47.340 
okay there we go is 0.5 4 and this so he

00:00:47.340 --> 00:00:51.410 
okay there we go is 0.5 4 and this so he
pulls<00:00:47.730> vertically<00:00:48.690> upward<00:00:50.420> vertically

00:00:51.410 --> 00:00:51.420 
pulls vertically upward vertically

00:00:51.420 --> 00:00:54.950 
pulls vertically upward vertically
downward<00:00:52.170> so<00:00:52.410> so<00:00:52.800> he'd<00:00:53.789> this<00:00:54.059> guy<00:00:54.239> this<00:00:54.690> little

00:00:54.950 --> 00:00:54.960 
downward so so he'd this guy this little

00:00:54.960 --> 00:00:59.990 
downward so so he'd this guy this little
box<00:00:55.440> pulls<00:00:55.860> the<00:00:56.190> rope<00:00:56.870> downward<00:00:58.219> that<00:00:59.219> passes

00:00:59.990 --> 00:01:00.000 
box pulls the rope downward that passes

00:01:00.000 --> 00:01:05.410 
box pulls the rope downward that passes
around<00:01:00.180> 3<00:01:01.020> pulleys<00:01:01.739> and<00:01:02.480> is<00:01:03.480> tied<00:01:03.840> on<00:01:04.199> his<00:01:04.530> feet

00:01:05.410 --> 00:01:05.420 
around 3 pulleys and is tied on his feet

00:01:05.420 --> 00:01:12.649 
around 3 pulleys and is tied on his feet
so<00:01:06.420> these<00:01:06.600> are<00:01:06.810> pulleys<00:01:10.880> what<00:01:11.880> is<00:01:12.060> the<00:01:12.210> minimum

00:01:12.649 --> 00:01:12.659 
so these are pulleys what is the minimum

00:01:12.659 --> 00:01:15.170 
so these are pulleys what is the minimum
pulling<00:01:13.140> force<00:01:13.439> that<00:01:13.770> the<00:01:13.979> clown<00:01:14.250> must<00:01:14.640> exert

00:01:15.170 --> 00:01:15.180 
pulling force that the clown must exert

00:01:15.180 --> 00:01:17.240 
pulling force that the clown must exert
to<00:01:15.840> yank<00:01:16.290> his<00:01:16.530> feet<00:01:16.770> out<00:01:16.950> of<00:01:16.979> the<00:01:17.159> ground

00:01:17.240 --> 00:01:17.250 
to yank his feet out of the ground

00:01:17.250 --> 00:01:20.330 
to yank his feet out of the ground
himself<00:01:17.960> okay<00:01:18.960> well<00:01:19.619> this<00:01:19.920> is<00:01:20.100> a<00:01:20.130> little

00:01:20.330 --> 00:01:20.340 
himself okay well this is a little

00:01:20.340 --> 00:01:22.280 
himself okay well this is a little
complicated<00:01:20.820> well<00:01:21.390> let's<00:01:21.600> let's<00:01:21.900> look<00:01:22.110> at

00:01:22.280 --> 00:01:22.290 
complicated well let's let's look at

00:01:22.290 --> 00:01:24.260 
complicated well let's let's look at
let's<00:01:22.470> look<00:01:22.619> at<00:01:22.890> a<00:01:22.920> let's<00:01:23.460> try<00:01:23.670> drawing<00:01:23.970> a

00:01:24.260 --> 00:01:24.270 
let's look at a let's try drawing a

00:01:24.270 --> 00:01:27.649 
let's look at a let's try drawing a

00:01:31.880 --> 00:01:31.890 
diagram for this ok so we have our we

00:01:31.890 --> 00:01:38.330 
diagram for this ok so we have our we
have<00:01:32.009> our<00:01:32.159> clown<00:01:33.229> we<00:01:34.229> have<00:01:34.409> our<00:01:34.590> clown<00:01:35.180> and<00:01:37.340> we

00:01:38.330 --> 00:01:38.340 
have our clown we have our clown and we

00:01:38.340 --> 00:01:43.880 
have our clown we have our clown and we
have<00:01:40.159> we<00:01:41.159> have<00:01:41.189> our<00:01:42.229> well<00:01:43.229> you're<00:01:43.740> you're

00:01:43.880 --> 00:01:43.890 
have we have our well you're you're

00:01:43.890 --> 00:01:48.819 
have we have our well you're you're
pulling<00:01:44.310> you're<00:01:44.549> pulling<00:01:44.850> it<00:01:44.970> this<00:01:45.149> way<00:01:45.360> so

00:01:48.819 --> 00:01:48.829 

00:01:48.829 --> 00:01:52.280 

well<00:01:49.829> okay<00:01:50.450> well<00:01:51.450> actually<00:01:51.659> if<00:01:52.049> you're<00:01:52.200> if

00:01:52.280 --> 00:01:52.290 
well okay well actually if you're if

00:01:52.290 --> 00:01:53.600 
well okay well actually if you're if
you're<00:01:52.320> pulling<00:01:52.680> it<00:01:52.920> you<00:01:53.070> go<00:01:53.220> you're<00:01:53.399> going

00:01:53.600 --> 00:01:53.610 
you're pulling it you go you're going

00:01:53.610 --> 00:01:55.550 
you're pulling it you go you're going
upward<00:01:54.119> so<00:01:54.479> so<00:01:54.780> it's<00:01:54.960> going<00:01:55.110> to<00:01:55.170> be<00:01:55.229> like<00:01:55.380> this

00:01:55.550 --> 00:01:55.560 
upward so so it's going to be like this

00:01:55.560 --> 00:01:59.510 
upward so so it's going to be like this
so<00:01:55.850> this<00:01:56.850> is<00:01:57.299> a<00:01:57.560> let's<00:01:58.560> let's<00:01:58.799> call<00:01:58.950> this<00:01:59.130> force

00:01:59.510 --> 00:01:59.520 
so this is a let's let's call this force

00:01:59.520 --> 00:02:07.670 
so this is a let's let's call this force
of<00:01:59.880> pulling<00:02:00.240> so<00:02:00.780> F<00:02:01.170> sub<00:02:02.070> P<00:02:02.369> so<00:02:02.969> F<00:02:03.240> sub<00:02:03.930> P<00:02:05.780> okay

00:02:07.670 --> 00:02:07.680 
of pulling so F sub P so F sub P okay

00:02:07.680 --> 00:02:13.310 
of pulling so F sub P so F sub P okay
and<00:02:08.490> of<00:02:08.880> course<00:02:09.149> we<00:02:09.450> have<00:02:09.720> our<00:02:10.460> we<00:02:11.460> have<00:02:11.490> our<00:02:12.320> we

00:02:13.310 --> 00:02:13.320 
and of course we have our we have our we

00:02:13.320 --> 00:02:17.240 
and of course we have our we have our we
have<00:02:13.470> our<00:02:13.590> frictional<00:02:14.190> force<00:02:15.770> we<00:02:16.770> have<00:02:16.800> our

00:02:17.240 --> 00:02:17.250 
have our frictional force we have our

00:02:17.250 --> 00:02:19.640 
have our frictional force we have our
how<00:02:18.090> do<00:02:18.150> we<00:02:18.390> represent<00:02:18.900> that<00:02:18.960> so<00:02:19.230> we<00:02:19.380> have<00:02:19.500> our

00:02:19.640 --> 00:02:19.650 
how do we represent that so we have our

00:02:19.650 --> 00:02:22.220 
how do we represent that so we have our
frictional<00:02:20.160> port<00:02:20.400> force<00:02:20.700> and<00:02:21.030> it's<00:02:21.990> going<00:02:22.140> to

00:02:22.220 --> 00:02:22.230 
frictional port force and it's going to

00:02:22.230 --> 00:02:29.020 
frictional port force and it's going to
be<00:02:22.320> F<00:02:22.500> of<00:02:22.740> s<00:02:22.950> and<00:02:24.770> we<00:02:25.770> have<00:02:25.800> our<00:02:26.580> normal<00:02:27.240> force

00:02:29.020 --> 00:02:29.030 
be F of s and we have our normal force

00:02:29.030 --> 00:02:31.400 
be F of s and we have our normal force
well<00:02:30.030> actually<00:02:30.330> we<00:02:30.630> have<00:02:30.810> we<00:02:30.960> have<00:02:31.080> our<00:02:31.110> force

00:02:31.400 --> 00:02:31.410 
well actually we have we have our force

00:02:31.410 --> 00:02:33.020 
well actually we have we have our force
of<00:02:31.560> gravity<00:02:31.980> let's<00:02:32.250> do<00:02:32.430> that<00:02:32.580> first<00:02:32.790> so

00:02:33.020 --> 00:02:33.030 
of gravity let's do that first so

00:02:33.030 --> 00:02:38.180 
of gravity let's do that first so
gravity<00:02:33.510> so<00:02:34.290> force<00:02:34.590> of<00:02:34.830> gravity<00:02:36.980> which<00:02:37.980> is<00:02:38.010> mg

00:02:38.180 --> 00:02:38.190 
gravity so force of gravity which is mg

00:02:38.190 --> 00:02:42.620 
gravity so force of gravity which is mg
so<00:02:38.970> let<00:02:39.120> me<00:02:39.210> just<00:02:39.390> write<00:02:39.540> this<00:02:39.600> as<00:02:39.780> mg<00:02:40.560> and<00:02:41.630> we

00:02:42.620 --> 00:02:42.630 
so let me just write this as mg and we

00:02:42.630 --> 00:02:47.060 
so let me just write this as mg and we
have<00:02:42.840> our<00:02:43.050> normal<00:02:43.260> force<00:02:45.260> we<00:02:46.260> have<00:02:46.290> our<00:02:46.590> normal

00:02:47.060 --> 00:02:47.070 
have our normal force we have our normal

00:02:47.070 --> 00:02:52.150 
have our normal force we have our normal
force<00:02:47.810> normal<00:02:48.810> force<00:02:49.550> so<00:02:50.550> force<00:02:51.240> of

00:02:52.150 --> 00:02:52.160 
force normal force so force of

00:02:52.160 --> 00:02:58.030 
force normal force so force of
normalness<00:02:53.300> okay<00:02:55.010> all<00:02:56.010> right<00:02:56.130> so<00:02:56.310> mg<00:02:56.820> isn't<00:02:57.270> um

00:02:58.030 --> 00:02:58.040 
normalness okay all right so mg isn't um

00:02:58.040 --> 00:03:02.930 
normalness okay all right so mg isn't um
totally<00:02:59.330> force<00:03:00.330> of<00:03:00.540> normal<00:03:00.900> so<00:03:01.220> okay<00:03:02.220> so<00:03:02.670> what

00:03:02.930 --> 00:03:02.940 
totally force of normal so okay so what

00:03:02.940 --> 00:03:05.480 
totally force of normal so okay so what
what<00:03:03.270> what<00:03:03.570> do<00:03:03.990> we<00:03:04.200> what<00:03:04.590> do<00:03:04.770> we<00:03:04.920> have<00:03:05.160> to<00:03:05.310> do

00:03:05.480 --> 00:03:05.490 
what what do we what do we have to do

00:03:05.490 --> 00:03:10.790 
what what do we what do we have to do
here<00:03:05.910> well<00:03:06.450> we<00:03:07.260> want<00:03:07.590> our<00:03:07.800> FS<00:03:08.610> to<00:03:09.060> equal<00:03:09.800> equal

00:03:10.790 --> 00:03:10.800 
here well we want our FS to equal equal

00:03:10.800 --> 00:03:19.690 
here well we want our FS to equal equal
F<00:03:11.010> P<00:03:11.310> right<00:03:12.260> so<00:03:13.260> we<00:03:13.410> want<00:03:13.620> our<00:03:13.739> FS<00:03:14.510> to<00:03:15.510> equal<00:03:16.290> FP

00:03:19.690 --> 00:03:19.700 

00:03:19.700 --> 00:03:24.920 

FP<00:03:21.530> alright<00:03:22.530> let's<00:03:23.489> try<00:03:23.700> to<00:03:23.760> define<00:03:24.030> FS<00:03:24.690> in

00:03:24.920 --> 00:03:24.930 
FP alright let's try to define FS in

00:03:24.930 --> 00:03:25.699 
FP alright let's try to define FS in
another<00:03:25.230> term

00:03:25.699 --> 00:03:25.709 
another term

00:03:25.709 --> 00:03:34.120 
another term
well<00:03:25.830> FS<00:03:27.470> FS<00:03:28.470> is<00:03:28.830> is<00:03:29.269> micro<00:03:31.040> micro<00:03:32.040> of<00:03:32.190> s<00:03:32.370> times

00:03:34.120 --> 00:03:34.130 
well FS FS is is micro micro of s times

00:03:34.130 --> 00:03:42.290 
well FS FS is is micro micro of s times
times<00:03:35.130> a<00:03:35.400> force<00:03:37.310> force<00:03:38.310> of<00:03:40.250> then<00:03:41.250> the<00:03:41.880> normal

00:03:42.290 --> 00:03:42.300 
times a force force of then the normal

00:03:42.300 --> 00:03:44.390 
times a force force of then the normal
force<00:03:42.540> okay<00:03:43.290> well<00:03:43.590> we<00:03:43.800> don't<00:03:43.950> know<00:03:44.070> the<00:03:44.190> normal

00:03:44.390 --> 00:03:44.400 
force okay well we don't know the normal

00:03:44.400 --> 00:03:47.690 
force okay well we don't know the normal
force<00:03:44.730> so<00:03:45.390> let's<00:03:45.709> so<00:03:46.709> let's<00:03:46.739> just<00:03:47.310> plug<00:03:47.519> it

00:03:47.690 --> 00:03:47.700 
force so let's so let's just plug it

00:03:47.700 --> 00:03:49.670 
force so let's so let's just plug it
into<00:03:47.850> here<00:03:48.269> and<00:03:48.420> see<00:03:48.930> what<00:03:49.080> happens<00:03:49.110> so<00:03:49.410> it's

00:03:49.670 --> 00:03:49.680 
into here and see what happens so it's

00:03:49.680 --> 00:03:53.930 
into here and see what happens so it's
going<00:03:49.860> to<00:03:49.950> be<00:03:50.040> 0.0<00:03:50.600> 0.5<00:03:51.600> 4<00:03:52.130> times<00:03:53.130> the<00:03:53.580> normal

00:03:53.930 --> 00:03:53.940 
going to be 0.0 0.5 4 times the normal

00:03:53.940 --> 00:03:58.280 
going to be 0.0 0.5 4 times the normal
force<00:03:54.410> times<00:03:55.410> the<00:03:55.680> normal<00:03:56.010> force<00:03:57.080> times<00:03:58.080> the

00:03:58.280 --> 00:03:58.290 
force times the normal force times the

00:03:58.290 --> 00:04:05.300 
force times the normal force times the
normal<00:03:58.560> force<00:03:58.830> is<00:03:59.010> equal<00:03:59.340> to<00:03:59.370> FP<00:04:01.430> FP<00:04:04.010> all<00:04:05.010> right

00:04:05.300 --> 00:04:05.310 
normal force is equal to FP FP all right

00:04:05.310 --> 00:04:09.890 
normal force is equal to FP FP all right
okay<00:04:06.239> well<00:04:06.450> what<00:04:06.630> is<00:04:06.750> mg<00:04:07.140> mg<00:04:07.950> is<00:04:08.070> a<00:04:08.570> way<00:04:09.570> we<00:04:09.780> get

00:04:09.890 --> 00:04:09.900 
okay well what is mg mg is a way we get

00:04:09.900 --> 00:04:15.740 
okay well what is mg mg is a way we get
our<00:04:10.049> mg<00:04:10.440> s<00:04:10.970> 840<00:04:11.970> Newton's<00:04:13.519> so<00:04:14.519> mg<00:04:15.060> let's<00:04:15.570> write

00:04:15.740 --> 00:04:15.750 
our mg s 840 Newton's so mg let's write

00:04:15.750 --> 00:04:20.170 
our mg s 840 Newton's so mg let's write
this<00:04:15.930> down<00:04:16.079> so<00:04:16.139> mg<00:04:16.739> is<00:04:17.900> 840

00:04:20.170 --> 00:04:20.180 
this down so mg is 840

00:04:20.180 --> 00:04:23.660 
this down so mg is 840
Newton's<00:04:21.830> okay<00:04:22.830> and<00:04:22.950> how<00:04:23.100> do<00:04:23.160> how<00:04:23.430> do<00:04:23.490> we

00:04:23.660 --> 00:04:23.670 
Newton's okay and how do how do we

00:04:23.670 --> 00:04:28.850 
Newton's okay and how do how do we
define<00:04:24.200> define<00:04:25.200> a<00:04:25.490> normal<00:04:26.490> force<00:04:26.790> well<00:04:27.860> normal

00:04:28.850 --> 00:04:28.860 
define define a normal force well normal

00:04:28.860 --> 00:04:36.290 
define define a normal force well normal
force<00:04:29.220> is<00:04:29.960> the<00:04:30.960> is<00:04:32.300> is<00:04:33.860> the<00:04:34.860> force<00:04:35.160> that<00:04:35.300> the

00:04:36.290 --> 00:04:36.300 
force is the is is the force that the

00:04:36.300 --> 00:04:38.750 
force is the is is the force that the
ground<00:04:36.660> exerts<00:04:37.230> on<00:04:37.410> this<00:04:37.710> material<00:04:38.340> so<00:04:38.610> it's

00:04:38.750 --> 00:04:38.760 
ground exerts on this material so it's

00:04:38.760 --> 00:04:42.350 
ground exerts on this material so it's
going<00:04:38.910> to<00:04:38.970> be<00:04:39.180> so<00:04:40.020> in<00:04:40.500> in<00:04:40.950> this<00:04:41.160> contest<00:04:41.850> top

00:04:42.350 --> 00:04:42.360 
going to be so in in this contest top

00:04:42.360 --> 00:04:46.430 
going to be so in in this contest top
context<00:04:43.170> force<00:04:43.830> of<00:04:44.100> normal<00:04:44.610> is<00:04:44.990> eight<00:04:45.990> hundred

00:04:46.430 --> 00:04:46.440 
context force of normal is eight hundred

00:04:46.440 --> 00:04:54.230 
context force of normal is eight hundred
forty<00:04:47.660> forty<00:04:48.680> minus<00:04:49.680> the<00:04:50.400> force<00:04:50.700> of<00:04:50.940> P<00:04:52.970> so<00:04:53.970> the

00:04:54.230 --> 00:04:54.240 
forty forty minus the force of P so the

00:04:54.240 --> 00:04:56.270 
forty forty minus the force of P so the
force<00:04:54.540> of<00:04:54.690> pulling<00:04:54.900> so<00:04:55.800> let's<00:04:56.040> let's

00:04:56.270 --> 00:04:56.280 
force of pulling so let's let's

00:04:56.280 --> 00:04:59.200 
force of pulling so let's let's
substitute<00:04:57.000> that<00:04:57.360> in<00:04:57.720> here<00:04:57.750> so<00:04:58.530> we<00:04:58.740> get<00:04:58.950> a

00:04:59.200 --> 00:04:59.210 
substitute that in here so we get a

00:04:59.210 --> 00:05:07.520 
substitute that in here so we get a
point<00:05:00.210> five<00:05:00.660> four<00:05:01.820> times<00:05:03.620> eight<00:05:04.620> forty<00:05:06.530> forty

00:05:07.520 --> 00:05:07.530 
point five four times eight forty forty

00:05:07.530 --> 00:05:12.440 
point five four times eight forty forty
minus<00:05:08.520> force<00:05:09.180> of<00:05:09.450> pulling<00:05:09.840> is<00:05:10.970> equal<00:05:11.970> to<00:05:12.180> the

00:05:12.440 --> 00:05:12.450 
minus force of pulling is equal to the

00:05:12.450 --> 00:05:13.580 
minus force of pulling is equal to the
force<00:05:12.690> of<00:05:12.930> pulling

00:05:13.580 --> 00:05:13.590 
force of pulling

00:05:13.590 --> 00:05:16.580 
force of pulling
okay<00:05:14.430> so<00:05:14.490> we've<00:05:14.880> reduced<00:05:15.420> two<00:05:15.690> variables<00:05:16.320> into

00:05:16.580 --> 00:05:16.590 
okay so we've reduced two variables into

00:05:16.590 --> 00:05:19.100 
okay so we've reduced two variables into
one<00:05:16.830> variable<00:05:17.250> now<00:05:17.520> we<00:05:17.580> can<00:05:17.910> we<00:05:18.420> can<00:05:18.600> solve<00:05:18.930> for

00:05:19.100 --> 00:05:19.110 
one variable now we can we can solve for

00:05:19.110 --> 00:05:21.710 
one variable now we can we can solve for
force<00:05:20.100> of<00:05:20.310> pulling<00:05:20.700> so<00:05:21.000> how<00:05:21.210> do<00:05:21.270> we<00:05:21.420> do<00:05:21.570> that

00:05:21.710 --> 00:05:21.720 
force of pulling so how do we do that

00:05:21.720 --> 00:05:23.450 
force of pulling so how do we do that
well<00:05:21.900> we<00:05:22.080> can<00:05:22.260> can<00:05:22.800> certainly<00:05:23.100> use<00:05:23.190> the

00:05:23.450 --> 00:05:23.460 
well we can can certainly use the

00:05:23.460 --> 00:05:26.600 
well we can can certainly use the
distributive<00:05:23.880> property<00:05:24.150> so<00:05:24.980> let's<00:05:25.980> let's<00:05:26.400> do

00:05:26.600 --> 00:05:26.610 
distributive property so let's let's do

00:05:26.610 --> 00:05:35.630 
distributive property so let's let's do
that<00:05:27.800> so<00:05:28.800> 0.5<00:05:29.430> 4<00:05:30.980> times<00:05:31.980> 8<00:05:32.340> for<00:05:32.580> t<00:05:32.700> is<00:05:34.220> for<00:05:35.220> fifty

00:05:35.630 --> 00:05:35.640 
that so 0.5 4 times 8 for t is for fifty

00:05:35.640 --> 00:05:40.190 
that so 0.5 4 times 8 for t is for fifty
three<00:05:35.940> point<00:05:36.210> six<00:05:37.070> four<00:05:38.070> fifty<00:05:38.640> three<00:05:39.200> point

00:05:40.190 --> 00:05:40.200 
three point six four fifty three point

00:05:40.200 --> 00:05:44.840 
three point six four fifty three point
six<00:05:40.670> minus<00:05:41.670> four<00:05:41.970> so<00:05:42.180> pulling<00:05:42.540> is<00:05:42.660> 0.5<00:05:43.170> for<00:05:43.850> so

00:05:44.840 --> 00:05:44.850 
six minus four so pulling is 0.5 for so

00:05:44.850 --> 00:05:53.810 
six minus four so pulling is 0.5 for so
point<00:05:45.270> five<00:05:45.600> for<00:05:48.920> 0.5<00:05:49.920> for<00:05:50.250> our<00:05:52.220> yes<00:05:53.220> just<00:05:53.610> just

00:05:53.810 --> 00:05:53.820 
point five for 0.5 for our yes just just

00:05:53.820 --> 00:05:58.090 
point five for 0.5 for our yes just just
0.5<00:05:54.270> four<00:05:54.570> point<00:05:55.380> five<00:05:55.620> four<00:05:56.040> four<00:05:57.000> so<00:05:57.240> pulling

00:05:58.090 --> 00:05:58.100 
0.5 four point five four four so pulling

00:05:58.100 --> 00:06:01.970 
0.5 four point five four four so pulling
is<00:05:59.100> equal<00:05:59.550> to<00:05:59.730> four<00:06:00.060> so<00:06:00.090> pulling<00:06:00.860> okay<00:06:01.860> and

00:06:01.970 --> 00:06:01.980 
is equal to four so pulling okay and

00:06:01.980 --> 00:06:03.770 
is equal to four so pulling okay and
then<00:06:02.100> we<00:06:02.250> add<00:06:02.400> point<00:06:02.790> five<00:06:02.970> four<00:06:03.210> to<00:06:03.330> each<00:06:03.480> side

00:06:03.770 --> 00:06:03.780 
then we add point five four to each side

00:06:03.780 --> 00:06:08.060 
then we add point five four to each side
and<00:06:04.050> we<00:06:04.740> get<00:06:04.920> a<00:06:05.810> 1-1<00:06:06.810> distance<00:06:07.380> is<00:06:07.470> 1/4<00:06:07.920> so

00:06:08.060 --> 00:06:08.070 
and we get a 1-1 distance is 1/4 so

00:06:08.070 --> 00:06:09.740 
and we get a 1-1 distance is 1/4 so
pulling<00:06:08.370> it's<00:06:08.490> just<00:06:08.730> one<00:06:08.970> point<00:06:09.210> five<00:06:09.510> four

00:06:09.740 --> 00:06:09.750 
pulling it's just one point five four

00:06:09.750 --> 00:06:12.170 
pulling it's just one point five four
positive<00:06:10.170> 4<00:06:10.350> so<00:06:10.380> pulling<00:06:10.860> so<00:06:11.130> let<00:06:11.370> me<00:06:11.460> just<00:06:11.670> let

00:06:12.170 --> 00:06:12.180 
positive 4 so pulling so let me just let

00:06:12.180 --> 00:06:14.180 
positive 4 so pulling so let me just let
me<00:06:12.270> just<00:06:12.330> copy<00:06:13.140> this<00:06:13.470> so<00:06:13.680> that<00:06:13.830> I<00:06:13.860> don't<00:06:13.980> have

00:06:14.180 --> 00:06:14.190 
me just copy this so that I don't have

00:06:14.190 --> 00:06:20.020 
me just copy this so that I don't have
to<00:06:17.450> what<00:06:18.450> the<00:06:18.570> wonders<00:06:18.930> of<00:06:19.080> technology

00:06:20.020 --> 00:06:20.030 
to what the wonders of technology

00:06:20.030 --> 00:06:25.430 
to what the wonders of technology
okay<00:06:21.030> so<00:06:21.090> 0.5<00:06:22.050> for<00:06:22.760> so<00:06:23.760> what<00:06:24.030> 1.5<00:06:24.870> for<00:06:25.170> let<00:06:25.350> me

00:06:25.430 --> 00:06:25.440 
okay so 0.5 for so what 1.5 for let me

00:06:25.440 --> 00:06:29.210 
okay so 0.5 for so what 1.5 for let me
just<00:06:26.870> yeah<00:06:27.870> maybe<00:06:28.140> maybe<00:06:28.470> it's<00:06:28.710> easier<00:06:28.860> if<00:06:29.130> I

00:06:29.210 --> 00:06:29.220 
just yeah maybe maybe it's easier if I

00:06:29.220 --> 00:06:31.210 
just yeah maybe maybe it's easier if I
write<00:06:29.460> it<00:06:29.610> again<00:06:29.850> but

00:06:31.210 --> 00:06:31.220 
write it again but

00:06:31.220 --> 00:06:33.760 
write it again but
but<00:06:31.910> we<00:06:32.510> can<00:06:32.690> do<00:06:32.840> we<00:06:33.020> can<00:06:33.050> certainly<00:06:33.530> do<00:06:33.740> this

00:06:33.760 --> 00:06:33.770 
but we can do we can certainly do this

00:06:33.770 --> 00:06:38.980 
but we can do we can certainly do this
as<00:06:34.070> well<00:06:34.280> so<00:06:35.500> so<00:06:36.500> um<00:06:37.120> now<00:06:38.120> we<00:06:38.180> can<00:06:38.630> solve<00:06:38.840> for

00:06:38.980 --> 00:06:38.990 
as well so so um now we can solve for

00:06:38.990 --> 00:06:41.580 
as well so so um now we can solve for
force<00:06:39.440> of<00:06:39.620> bullying<00:06:40.010> so<00:06:40.310> force<00:06:40.610> of<00:06:40.880> pulling<00:06:41.180> is

00:06:41.580 --> 00:06:41.590 
force of bullying so force of pulling is

00:06:41.590 --> 00:06:46.930 
force of bullying so force of pulling is
equal<00:06:42.590> to<00:06:42.830> four<00:06:44.140> 450<00:06:45.140> the<00:06:45.590> answer<00:06:46.400> for<00:06:46.640> fifty

00:06:46.930 --> 00:06:46.940 
equal to four 450 the answer for fifty

00:06:46.940 --> 00:06:50.500 
equal to four 450 the answer for fifty
three<00:06:47.120> point<00:06:47.300> six<00:06:47.600> divided<00:06:48.110> by<00:06:49.060> one<00:06:50.060> point

00:06:50.500 --> 00:06:50.510 
three point six divided by one point

00:06:50.510 --> 00:06:53.770 
three point six divided by one point
five<00:06:50.690> four<00:06:51.290> so<00:06:51.800> we<00:06:52.010> get<00:06:52.220> two<00:06:52.850> hundred<00:06:53.420> ninety

00:06:53.770 --> 00:06:53.780 
five four so we get two hundred ninety

00:06:53.780 --> 00:06:59.620 
five four so we get two hundred ninety
four<00:06:54.020> point<00:06:54.290> five<00:06:55.600> and<00:06:57.700> then<00:06:58.700> five<00:06:58.730> five<00:06:59.360> if

00:06:59.620 --> 00:06:59.630 
four point five and then five five if

00:06:59.630 --> 00:07:02.200 
four point five and then five five if
you<00:06:59.660> want<00:06:59.900> to<00:06:59.960> round<00:07:00.140> it<00:07:00.290> that<00:07:00.500> way<00:07:01.000> so<00:07:02.000> let's

00:07:02.200 --> 00:07:02.210 
you want to round it that way so let's

00:07:02.210 --> 00:07:04.870 
you want to round it that way so let's
in<00:07:02.570> let's<00:07:02.780> type<00:07:03.560> that<00:07:03.800> into<00:07:04.010> our<00:07:04.250> WebAssign

00:07:04.870 --> 00:07:04.880 
in let's type that into our WebAssign

00:07:04.880 --> 00:07:10.420 
in let's type that into our WebAssign
and<00:07:05.060> see<00:07:05.180> if<00:07:05.270> we<00:07:05.360> get<00:07:05.510> it<00:07:05.600> right<00:07:05.720> and<00:07:09.100> we<00:07:10.100> get<00:07:10.310> it

00:07:10.420 --> 00:07:10.430 
and see if we get it right and we get it

00:07:10.430 --> 00:07:13.500 
and see if we get it right and we get it
right<00:07:10.610> so<00:07:11.030> this<00:07:11.420> is<00:07:11.480> the<00:07:11.840> correct<00:07:12.230> answer<00:07:12.500> so

00:07:13.500 --> 00:07:13.510 
right so this is the correct answer so

00:07:13.510 --> 00:07:16.030 
right so this is the correct answer so
you<00:07:14.510> you<00:07:14.900> might<00:07:15.110> have<00:07:15.140> different<00:07:15.590> numbers<00:07:16.010> for

00:07:16.030 --> 00:07:16.040 
you you might have different numbers for

00:07:16.040 --> 00:07:18.400 
you you might have different numbers for
eight<00:07:16.340> 48.54<00:07:17.330> I<00:07:17.750> should<00:07:17.930> have<00:07:18.050> said<00:07:18.230> that

00:07:18.400 --> 00:07:18.410 
eight 48.54 I should have said that

00:07:18.410 --> 00:07:21.640 
eight 48.54 I should have said that
earlier<00:07:18.620> but<00:07:19.160> um<00:07:19.460> I<00:07:20.360> think<00:07:20.600> I<00:07:20.840> forgot<00:07:21.050> so<00:07:21.620> I

00:07:21.640 --> 00:07:21.650 
earlier but um I think I forgot so I

00:07:21.650 --> 00:07:23.950 
earlier but um I think I forgot so I
hope<00:07:21.980> you<00:07:22.220> I<00:07:22.460> hope<00:07:22.910> you<00:07:23.180> notice<00:07:23.540> that<00:07:23.690> in<00:07:23.870> the

00:07:23.950 --> 00:07:23.960 
hope you I hope you notice that in the

00:07:23.960 --> 00:07:26.200 
hope you I hope you notice that in the
middle<00:07:24.260> and<00:07:24.590> I<00:07:24.860> hope<00:07:25.010> I<00:07:25.190> hope<00:07:25.640> I<00:07:25.790> helped<00:07:26.090> you
