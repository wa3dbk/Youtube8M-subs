very much the same HTC has certainly

very much the same HTC has certainly
beefed<00:00:51.660> up<00:00:51.840> the<00:00:52.020> HTC<00:00:52.469> One<00:00:52.739> m9<00:00:52.980> not<00:00:53.550> only<00:00:53.789> the

beefed up the HTC One m9 not only the

00:00:53.910 --> 00:00:56.000 
beefed up the HTC One m9 not only the
power<00:00:54.149> but<00:00:54.719> also<00:00:54.870> the<00:00:55.140> casing<00:00:55.590> it's<00:00:55.800> now

00:00:56.000 --> 00:00:56.010 
power but also the casing it's now

00:00:56.010 --> 00:00:56.689 
power but also the casing it's now
thicker

00:00:56.689 --> 00:00:56.699 
thicker

thicker
however<00:00:57.059> grippier<00:00:57.570> than<00:00:57.780> the<00:00:57.870> m9<00:00:58.260> HTC<00:00:59.010> has

00:00:59.180 --> 00:00:59.190 
however grippier than the m9 HTC has

00:00:59.190 --> 00:01:00.560 
however grippier than the m9 HTC has
pretty<00:00:59.370> much<00:00:59.460> decided<00:01:00.090> why<00:01:00.300> mess<00:01:00.539> with

00:01:00.560 --> 00:01:00.570 
pretty much decided why mess with

00:01:00.570 --> 00:01:02.630 
pretty much decided why mess with
perfection<00:01:00.780> that<00:01:01.440> m8<00:01:01.739> was<00:01:02.039> already<00:01:02.399> good

00:01:02.630 --> 00:01:02.640 
perfection that m8 was already good

00:01:02.640 --> 00:01:04.520 
perfection that m8 was already good
let's<00:01:03.059> just<00:01:03.239> take<00:01:03.449> that<00:01:03.629> and<00:01:03.840> work<00:01:04.049> on<00:01:04.229> it<00:01:04.260> kind

00:01:04.520 --> 00:01:04.530 
let's just take that and work on it kind

00:01:04.530 --> 00:01:07.370 
let's just take that and work on it kind
of<00:01:04.650> like<00:01:04.739> an<00:01:05.040> iPhone<00:01:05.460> 5<00:01:05.850> to<00:01:05.880> 5s<00:01:06.600> upgrade<00:01:07.110> you

00:01:07.370 --> 00:01:07.380 
of like an iPhone 5 to 5s upgrade you

00:01:07.380 --> 00:01:08.899 
of like an iPhone 5 to 5s upgrade you
know<00:01:07.470> just<00:01:07.740> an<00:01:07.830> incremental<00:01:08.310> upgrade<00:01:08.549> with

00:01:08.899 --> 00:01:08.909 
know just an incremental upgrade with

00:01:08.909 --> 00:01:11.000 
know just an incremental upgrade with
very<00:01:09.180> minor<00:01:09.420> differences<00:01:09.990> so<00:01:10.380> it<00:01:10.530> is<00:01:10.619> a<00:01:10.650> little

00:01:11.000 --> 00:01:11.010 
very minor differences so it is a little

00:01:11.010 --> 00:01:13.370 
very minor differences so it is a little
bit<00:01:11.220> thicker<00:01:11.460> now<00:01:11.700> almost<00:01:12.299> three<00:01:12.600> millimeters

00:01:13.370 --> 00:01:13.380 
bit thicker now almost three millimeters

00:01:13.380 --> 00:01:14.960 
bit thicker now almost three millimeters
thicker<00:01:13.680> and<00:01:14.010> that<00:01:14.159> does<00:01:14.369> make<00:01:14.520> a<00:01:14.580> difference

00:01:14.960 --> 00:01:14.970 
thicker and that does make a difference

00:01:14.970 --> 00:01:16.550 
thicker and that does make a difference
it<00:01:15.119> makes<00:01:15.270> it<00:01:15.390> more<00:01:15.479> comfortable<00:01:15.720> to<00:01:16.020> hold<00:01:16.350> but

00:01:16.550 --> 00:01:16.560 
it makes it more comfortable to hold but

00:01:16.560 --> 00:01:18.200 
it makes it more comfortable to hold but
ultimately<00:01:16.920> it<00:01:17.220> is<00:01:17.369> a<00:01:17.400> slightly<00:01:17.850> thicker

00:01:18.200 --> 00:01:18.210 
ultimately it is a slightly thicker

00:01:18.210 --> 00:01:20.300 
ultimately it is a slightly thicker
phone<00:01:18.570> the<00:01:18.810> design<00:01:19.140> has<00:01:19.409> changed<00:01:19.439> it's<00:01:20.220> a

00:01:20.300 --> 00:01:20.310 
phone the design has changed it's a

00:01:20.310 --> 00:01:22.340 
phone the design has changed it's a
little<00:01:20.549> messier<00:01:20.970> now<00:01:21.240> it's<00:01:21.540> not<00:01:21.720> necessarily

00:01:22.340 --> 00:01:22.350 
little messier now it's not necessarily

00:01:22.350 --> 00:01:24.289 
little messier now it's not necessarily
for<00:01:22.380> the<00:01:22.530> better<00:01:22.619> the<00:01:23.100> m8<00:01:23.430> featured<00:01:23.850> a<00:01:24.030> well

00:01:24.289 --> 00:01:24.299 
for the better the m8 featured a well

00:01:24.299 --> 00:01:26.810 
for the better the m8 featured a well
rounded<00:01:24.540> unibody<00:01:25.170> design<00:01:25.259> whereas<00:01:26.189> the<00:01:26.280> m9<00:01:26.610> is

00:01:26.810 --> 00:01:26.820 
rounded unibody design whereas the m9 is

rounded unibody design whereas the m9 is
split<00:01:27.090> up<00:01:27.119> into<00:01:27.330> two<00:01:27.630> sections<00:01:27.869> the<00:01:28.350> bottom

00:01:28.700 --> 00:01:28.710 
split up into two sections the bottom

00:01:28.710 --> 00:01:30.380 
split up into two sections the bottom
portion<00:01:28.860> of<00:01:29.100> the<00:01:29.189> phone<00:01:29.400> and<00:01:29.610> the<00:01:29.909> top<00:01:30.150> which

00:03:10.620 --> 00:03:13.220 
guys we both have Snapdragon processors
now<00:03:10.650> the<00:03:10.950> m9<00:03:11.310> has<00:03:11.549> the<00:03:11.730> latest<00:03:11.940> 810<00:03:12.690> version

00:03:13.220 --> 00:03:13.230 
now the m9 has the latest 810 version

00:03:13.230 --> 00:03:15.559 
now the m9 has the latest 810 version
which<00:03:13.680> is<00:03:13.829> an<00:03:13.980> octa-core<00:03:14.370> processor<00:03:15.060> with<00:03:15.360> 4

00:03:15.559 --> 00:03:15.569 
which is an octa-core processor with 4

00:03:15.569 --> 00:03:17.150 
which is an octa-core processor with 4
cores<00:03:15.870> that<00:03:15.959> are<00:03:16.110> slightly<00:03:16.379> slower<00:03:16.769> and<00:03:16.980> four

00:03:17.150 --> 00:03:17.160 
cores that are slightly slower and four

00:03:17.160 --> 00:03:18.650 
cores that are slightly slower and four
that<00:03:17.310> are<00:03:17.370> slightly<00:03:17.639> faster<00:03:18.359> which<00:03:18.630> means

00:03:18.650 --> 00:03:18.660 
that are slightly faster which means

00:03:18.660 --> 00:03:21.319 
that are slightly faster which means
that<00:03:19.049> you<00:03:19.290> get<00:03:19.410> very<00:03:19.709> good<00:03:19.889> multitasking<00:03:20.850> for

00:03:21.319 --> 00:03:21.329 
that you get very good multitasking for

00:03:21.329 --> 00:03:23.360 
that you get very good multitasking for
processor<00:03:21.840> intensive<00:03:22.139> applications<00:03:22.829> the<00:03:23.010> m9

00:03:23.360 --> 00:03:23.370 
processor intensive applications the m9

00:03:23.370 --> 00:03:24.920 
processor intensive applications the m9
is<00:03:23.400> definitely<00:03:24.000> going<00:03:24.180> to<00:03:24.209> beat<00:03:24.329> out<00:03:24.450> the<00:03:24.569> m8

00:03:24.920 --> 00:03:24.930 
is definitely going to beat out the m8

00:03:24.930 --> 00:03:26.809 
is definitely going to beat out the m8
so<00:03:25.319> I<00:03:25.350> wanted<00:03:25.829> to<00:03:25.920> put<00:03:26.040> that<00:03:26.160> to<00:03:26.250> the<00:03:26.280> test<00:03:26.370> in

00:03:26.809 --> 00:03:26.819 
so I wanted to put that to the test in

00:03:26.819 --> 00:03:28.370 
so I wanted to put that to the test in
real-life<00:03:27.090> usage<00:03:27.269> I'm<00:03:27.810> gonna<00:03:27.930> do<00:03:28.049> a<00:03:28.079> geek

of<00:06:09.370> people<00:06:09.610> want<00:06:09.790> to<00:06:09.850> get<00:06:09.910> the<00:06:10.030> new<00:06:10.120> m9<00:06:10.419> so<00:06:10.600> you

00:06:10.680 --> 00:06:10.690 
of people want to get the new m9 so you

00:06:10.690 --> 00:06:12.390 
of people want to get the new m9 so you
can<00:06:10.810> get<00:06:10.960> it<00:06:11.050> for<00:06:11.200> really<00:06:11.440> cheap<00:06:11.650> no<00:06:11.919> is<00:06:12.160> it

00:06:12.390 --> 00:06:12.400 
can get it for really cheap no is it

00:06:12.400 --> 00:06:14.580 
can get it for really cheap no is it
worth<00:06:12.669> upgrading<00:06:13.000> from<00:06:13.510> the<00:06:13.660> ma<00:06:13.930> to<00:06:13.990> the<00:06:14.229> m9<00:06:14.560> or

00:06:14.580 --> 00:06:14.590 
worth upgrading from the ma to the m9 or

00:06:14.590 --> 00:06:17.820 
worth upgrading from the ma to the m9 or
buying<00:06:15.160> an<00:06:15.340> m9<00:06:15.669> or<00:06:15.910> the<00:06:16.180> Hemi<00:06:16.450> well<00:06:17.050> not<00:06:17.530> really

00:06:17.820 --> 00:06:17.830 
buying an m9 or the Hemi well not really

00:06:17.830 --> 00:06:19.770 
buying an m9 or the Hemi well not really
it's<00:06:18.010> really<00:06:18.490> hard<00:06:18.729> to<00:06:18.850> justify<00:06:19.180> that<00:06:19.479> price

00:06:19.770 --> 00:06:19.780 
it's really hard to justify that price

00:06:19.780 --> 00:06:21.210 
it's really hard to justify that price
when<00:06:20.140> you're<00:06:20.290> not<00:06:20.410> getting<00:06:20.740> much<00:06:20.860> in<00:06:21.070> return

00:06:21.210 --> 00:06:21.220 
when you're not getting much in return

00:06:21.220 --> 00:06:23.280 
when you're not getting much in return
at<00:06:21.669> first<00:06:21.940> glance<00:06:22.240> these<00:06:22.570> devices<00:06:23.080> are

00:06:23.280 --> 00:06:23.290 
at first glance these devices are

00:06:23.290 --> 00:06:25.409 
at first glance these devices are
strikingly<00:06:23.800> similar<00:06:23.919> there's<00:06:24.760> really<00:06:25.090> not

00:06:25.409 --> 00:06:25.419 
strikingly similar there's really not

00:06:25.419 --> 00:06:27.210 
strikingly similar there's really not
much<00:06:25.690> distinguishing<00:06:26.530> one<00:06:26.740> from<00:06:26.950> the<00:06:27.070> other

00:06:27.210 --> 00:06:27.220 
much distinguishing one from the other

00:06:27.220 --> 00:06:29.580 
much distinguishing one from the other
especially<00:06:27.760> feature<00:06:28.240> wise<00:06:28.570> the<00:06:28.990> MA<00:06:29.350> is

00:06:29.580 --> 00:06:29.590 
especially feature wise the MA is

00:06:29.590 --> 00:06:31.380 
especially feature wise the MA is
cheaper<00:06:30.100> yet<00:06:30.310> it<00:06:30.460> can<00:06:30.550> do<00:06:30.640> almost<00:06:30.850> everything

00:06:31.380 --> 00:06:31.390 
cheaper yet it can do almost everything

00:06:31.390 --> 00:06:33.110 
cheaper yet it can do almost everything
that<00:06:31.570> the<00:06:31.720> HTC<00:06:32.260> One<00:06:32.530> m9

00:06:33.110 --> 00:06:33.120 
that the HTC One m9

00:06:33.120 --> 00:06:35.840 
that the HTC One m9
I<00:06:33.510> mean<00:06:33.750> m9<00:06:34.169> has<00:06:34.410> some<00:06:34.620> very<00:06:34.860> small<00:06:35.280> tweaking

00:06:35.840 --> 00:06:35.850 
I mean m9 has some very small tweaking

00:06:35.850 --> 00:06:37.700 
I mean m9 has some very small tweaking
to<00:06:36.030> the<00:06:36.150> display<00:06:36.600> really<00:06:37.229> nothing

00:06:37.700 --> 00:06:37.710 
to the display really nothing

00:06:37.710 --> 00:06:39.469 
to the display really nothing
significant<00:06:38.340> the<00:06:38.430> battery<00:06:38.820> is<00:06:38.910> just<00:06:39.120> a<00:06:39.240> little

00:06:39.469 --> 00:06:39.479 
significant the battery is just a little

00:06:39.479 --> 00:06:41.150 
significant the battery is just a little
bit<00:06:39.660> bigger<00:06:39.900> there's<00:06:40.530> a<00:06:40.650> little<00:06:40.949> bit<00:06:41.070> of

00:06:41.150 --> 00:06:41.160 
bit bigger there's a little bit of

00:06:41.160 --> 00:06:43.070 
bit bigger there's a little bit of
modification<00:06:41.370> but<00:06:42.150> modification<00:06:42.780> can<00:06:42.960> be

00:06:43.070 --> 00:06:43.080 
modification but modification can be

00:06:43.080 --> 00:06:44.719 
modification but modification can be
achieved<00:06:43.440> by<00:06:43.590> rooting<00:06:44.010> your<00:06:44.100> device<00:06:44.160> either

00:06:44.719 --> 00:06:44.729 
achieved by rooting your device either

way<00:06:45.180> the<00:06:45.720> camera<00:06:46.169> is<00:06:46.320> supposedly<00:06:47.040> a<00:06:47.070> little

00:06:47.570 --> 00:06:47.580 
way the camera is supposedly a little

00:06:47.580 --> 00:06:49.790 
way the camera is supposedly a little
bit<00:06:47.729> better<00:06:47.970> but<00:06:48.270> it's<00:06:48.419> still<00:06:48.479> not<00:06:48.690> great<00:06:49.470> the

00:06:49.790 --> 00:06:49.800 
bit better but it's still not great the

00:06:49.800 --> 00:06:51.680 
bit better but it's still not great the
only<00:06:49.979> reason<00:06:50.490> I'd<00:06:50.760> upgrade<00:06:51.120> from<00:06:51.240> the<00:06:51.389> MA<00:06:51.630> to

00:06:51.680 --> 00:06:51.690 
only reason I'd upgrade from the MA to

00:06:51.690 --> 00:06:53.900 
only reason I'd upgrade from the MA to
the<00:06:51.870> m9<00:06:52.260> is<00:06:52.290> because<00:06:52.830> of<00:06:52.949> the<00:06:53.070> Gorilla<00:06:53.310> Glass<00:06:53.610> 4

00:06:53.900 --> 00:06:53.910 
the m9 is because of the Gorilla Glass 4

00:06:53.910 --> 00:06:56.180 
the m9 is because of the Gorilla Glass 4
it's<00:06:54.270> extremely<00:06:54.930> durable<00:06:55.199> I<00:06:55.620> love<00:06:55.860> it<00:06:56.010> in<00:06:56.130> the

00:06:56.180 --> 00:06:56.190 
it's extremely durable I love it in the

00:06:56.190 --> 00:06:58.189 
it's extremely durable I love it in the
drop<00:06:56.400> test<00:06:56.610> it<00:06:56.880> showed<00:06:57.180> that<00:06:57.630> this<00:06:57.780> thing<00:06:58.020> can

00:06:58.189 --> 00:06:58.199 
drop test it showed that this thing can

00:06:58.199 --> 00:07:00.350 
drop test it showed that this thing can
take<00:06:58.380> a<00:06:58.440> hit<00:06:58.800> the<00:06:59.040> power<00:06:59.250> isn't<00:06:59.669> even<00:07:00.000> all<00:07:00.210> that

00:07:00.350 --> 00:07:00.360 
take a hit the power isn't even all that

00:07:00.360 --> 00:07:02.600 
take a hit the power isn't even all that
better<00:07:00.630> so<00:07:01.020> you<00:07:01.110> guys<00:07:01.260> can<00:07:01.440> see<00:07:01.650> why<00:07:01.919> I<00:07:01.949> be<00:07:02.400> so

00:07:02.600 --> 00:07:02.610 
better so you guys can see why I be so

00:07:02.610 --> 00:07:04.400 
better so you guys can see why I be so
hesitant<00:07:02.820> to<00:07:03.270> upgrade<00:07:03.630> from<00:07:03.750> the<00:07:03.900> MA<00:07:04.169> to<00:07:04.320> the

00:07:04.400 --> 00:07:04.410 
hesitant to upgrade from the MA to the

00:07:04.410 --> 00:07:06.590 
hesitant to upgrade from the MA to the
m9<00:07:04.770> there<00:07:05.070> just<00:07:05.250> isn't<00:07:05.400> too<00:07:05.820> much<00:07:06.000> compelling

00:07:06.590 --> 00:07:06.600 
m9 there just isn't too much compelling

00:07:06.600 --> 00:07:08.150 
m9 there just isn't too much compelling
reason<00:07:06.930> to<00:07:06.960> do<00:07:07.199> so<00:07:07.410> it's<00:07:07.710> certainly<00:07:08.039> a

00:07:08.150 --> 00:07:08.160 
reason to do so it's certainly a

00:07:08.160 --> 00:07:10.430 
reason to do so it's certainly a
beautiful<00:07:08.550> device<00:07:08.880> I<00:07:09.120> just<00:07:09.300> wish<00:07:09.479> HTC<00:07:10.080> made<00:07:10.289> it

00:07:10.430 --> 00:07:10.440 
beautiful device I just wish HTC made it

00:07:10.440 --> 00:07:11.900 
beautiful device I just wish HTC made it
a<00:07:10.530> little<00:07:10.680> bit<00:07:10.889> better<00:07:11.039> I'll<00:07:11.520> hope<00:07:11.699> you<00:07:11.789> guys
