my best moment in WWE thus far there
have<00:01:44.220> been<00:01:44.399> a<00:01:44.460> few<00:01:45.000> and<00:01:45.270> I<00:01:45.329> don't<00:01:45.390> mean<00:01:45.689> to<00:01:45.720> toot

have been a few and I don't mean to toot
my<00:01:46.110> own<00:01:46.289> horn<00:01:46.470> but<00:01:46.950> I<00:01:47.310> think<00:01:47.759> the<00:01:47.850> one<00:01:48.000> that

00:01:48.200 --> 00:01:48.210 
my own horn but I think the one that

00:01:48.210 --> 00:01:51.560 
my own horn but I think the one that
resonates<00:01:48.720> with<00:01:48.899> me<00:01:49.049> the<00:01:49.200> most<00:01:49.439> is<00:01:50.509> when<00:01:51.509> I

00:01:51.560 --> 00:01:51.570 
resonates with me the most is when I

00:01:51.570 --> 00:01:53.149 
resonates with me the most is when I
beat<00:01:51.990> Chris<00:01:52.289> Jericho<00:01:52.770> to<00:01:52.829> become
