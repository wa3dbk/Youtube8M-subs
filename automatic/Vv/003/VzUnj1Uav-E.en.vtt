one eye is bigger than the other and

00:01:00.809 --> 00:01:02.869 
one eye is bigger than the other and
it's<00:01:01.350> these<00:01:01.530> small<00:01:01.920> subtle<00:01:02.250> things<00:01:02.640> and

00:01:02.869 --> 00:01:02.879 
it's these small subtle things and

00:01:02.879 --> 00:01:04.250

beginning<00:01:04.439> to<00:01:04.920> creep<00:01:05.700> into<00:01:06.060> my<00:01:06.360> subconscious

00:01:06.859 --> 00:01:06.869 
beginning to creep into my subconscious

00:01:06.869 --> 00:01:10.219 
beginning to creep into my subconscious
and<00:01:07.470> it's<00:01:07.799> eating<00:01:08.340> away<00:01:08.640> at<00:01:08.850> my<00:01:09.270> self-esteem

00:01:10.219 --> 00:01:10.229 
and it's eating away at my self-esteem

00:01:10.229 --> 00:01:13.280 
and it's eating away at my self-esteem
even<00:01:11.189> though<00:01:11.369> they<00:01:11.610> really<00:01:11.939> shouldn't<00:01:12.290> it

00:01:13.280 --> 00:01:13.290 
even though they really shouldn't it

00:01:13.290 --> 00:01:15.140 
even though they really shouldn't it
also<00:01:13.560> probably<00:01:14.220> has<00:01:14.460> to<00:01:14.670> do<00:01:14.850> with<00:01:15.000> the<00:01:15.119> fact

00:01:15.140 --> 00:01:15.150 
also probably has to do with the fact

00:01:15.150 --> 00:01:17.240 
also probably has to do with the fact
that<00:01:15.509> I<00:01:15.630> haven't<00:01:15.960> been<00:01:16.259> feeling<00:01:16.590> well<00:01:16.799> because
