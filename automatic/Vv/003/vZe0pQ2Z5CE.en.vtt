00:00:00.560 --> 00:00:05.460
 today I'm going to get good and I had them 

00:00:03.810 --> 00:00:08.099
 I asked long ago to tell me 

00:00:05.460 --> 00:00:10.320
 how what topics did they want to see in videos 

00:00:08.099 --> 00:00:12.420
 specific and what I did was to make a 

00:00:10.320 --> 00:00:15.000
 list with a personalized agenda 

00:00:12.420 --> 00:00:17.400
 crisis is fennel but it is a brand 

00:00:15.000 --> 00:00:19.080
 American that with a roll ask for it 

00:00:17.400 --> 00:00:21.630
 so if you want to warm up the 

00:00:19.080 --> 00:00:25.310
 page but it was very complicated to ask 

00:00:21.630 --> 00:00:25.310
 for me but I liked it 

00:00:27.450 --> 00:00:34.260
 here I have written down all the ideas that 

00:00:30.330 --> 00:00:36.060
 I have first Saturdays on this side the 

00:00:34.260 --> 00:00:39.570
 The next page is the two 

00:00:36.060 --> 00:00:41.250
 Saturdays and I think that until now 

00:00:39.570 --> 00:00:44.100
 to point out others who also put me 

00:00:41.250 --> 00:00:46.650
 in the questions and answers but 

00:00:44.100 --> 00:00:49.170
 well then this video I guess it goes 

00:00:46.650 --> 00:00:51.210
 to be for a Thursday but is that as 

00:00:49.170 --> 00:00:52.770
 that I do not have well administered right now 

00:00:51.210 --> 00:00:55.110
 I'm going to talk about what I have to do 

00:00:52.770 --> 00:00:57.239
 advance a stream of videos because I 

00:00:55.110 --> 00:00:59.490
 I travel this moving day 

00:00:57.239 --> 00:01:01.890
 bachelorette now in March in 

00:00:59.490 --> 00:01:04.140
 April you can also see her single 

00:01:01.890 --> 00:01:05.790
 with my cousins â€‹â€‹now san marcos with my 

00:01:04.140 --> 00:01:08.910
 friends and in April with mass with my 

00:01:05.790 --> 00:01:10.200
 premiums we decided to advance that you 

00:01:08.910 --> 00:01:11.909
 is going to turn into a talking video 

00:01:10.200 --> 00:01:14.219
 about my wedding 

00:01:11.909 --> 00:01:16.109
 there is a rola ellipse combination that 

00:01:14.219 --> 00:01:17.939
 I bring the extra knick eyeliner in the 

00:01:16.109 --> 00:01:20.189
 kraft color but as you fill me 

00:01:17.939 --> 00:01:22.619
 everything and then I like the 'rascal' of 

00:01:20.189 --> 00:01:25.380
 marc we decided to advance the farewells 

00:01:22.619 --> 00:01:28.170
 the March with my friends because I think 

00:01:25.380 --> 00:01:31.140
 that in addition they could other dates and in 

00:01:28.170 --> 00:01:33.440
 April of my cousins â€‹â€‹because with my 

00:01:31.140 --> 00:01:36.740
 sister is pregnant 

00:01:33.440 --> 00:01:38.360
 they will be your baby in August then 

00:01:36.740 --> 00:01:40.670
 so my sister does not expect it to be 

00:01:38.360 --> 00:01:42.560
 Super bread are many and tired of 

00:01:40.670 --> 00:01:45.050
 maybe I do not even want to go 

00:01:42.560 --> 00:01:46.940
 then this we advance and as a 

00:01:45.050 --> 00:01:49.100
 another of my cousins also marries them 

00:01:46.940 --> 00:01:50.990
 let's put together the farewell to the wedding 

00:01:49.100 --> 00:01:52.100
 the good thing is that as a base January 

00:01:50.990 --> 00:01:54.320
 of 2016 

00:01:52.100 --> 00:01:56.180
 is missing a lot then we have good weather 

00:01:54.320 --> 00:01:57.980
 to organize everything that is good is that 

00:01:56.180 --> 00:02:00.710
 I have as I said a dress 

00:01:57.980 --> 00:02:02.360
 the wedding planners this then like 

00:02:00.710 --> 00:02:04.130
 that as soon as we have the place and everything 

00:02:02.360 --> 00:02:06.710
 otherwise not be easy because I know what 

00:02:04.130 --> 00:02:08.600
 kind what colors flowers I want and when 

00:02:06.710 --> 00:02:10.940
 I say that I mean that as the 

00:02:08.600 --> 00:02:12.950
 girl is picking flowers no more 

00:02:10.940 --> 00:02:14.570
 is my boyfriend if he is reviewing everything 

00:02:12.950 --> 00:02:16.160
 what were the wedding because yes 

00:02:14.570 --> 00:02:17.840
 let's see all together but like 

00:02:16.160 --> 00:02:21.020
 the flowers and it's something else like that 

00:02:17.840 --> 00:02:23.510
 well, it's like you or me who 

00:02:21.020 --> 00:02:26.570
 we have seen usual I went to an event of 

00:02:23.510 --> 00:02:28.970
 youtube last week in mexico and me 

00:02:26.570 --> 00:02:31.810
 I had already tried on wedding dresses and 

00:02:28.970 --> 00:02:34.430
 see them and so in Mexico in December 

00:02:31.810 --> 00:02:37.359
 so when I went I love it 

00:02:34.430 --> 00:02:40.760
 a veil is a dress I did not choose that and 

00:02:37.359 --> 00:02:42.530
 I decided to send me to make my dress is a 

00:02:40.760 --> 00:02:44.599
 story super long I tell you but 

00:02:42.530 --> 00:02:46.969
 to me I had tried several dresses and 

00:02:44.599 --> 00:02:48.560
 veils and when I tried those veils more 

00:02:46.969 --> 00:02:50.480
 I think you took me pictures and I loved it 

00:02:48.560 --> 00:02:52.400
 I cried until they put a veil on me 

00:02:50.480 --> 00:02:54.319
 fascinated me I do not know I tried a thousand dresses 

00:02:52.400 --> 00:02:56.560
 I never cried until I got that 

00:02:54.319 --> 00:02:56.560
 veil 

00:02:56.709 --> 00:03:00.800
 but I did not buy it that day like 

00:02:59.000 --> 00:03:02.150
 I said the veil after the dress for 

00:03:00.800 --> 00:03:04.160
 know what color is the dress 

00:03:02.150 --> 00:03:05.720
 etcetera and that the veil is left after 

00:03:04.160 --> 00:03:08.390
 That's when they told me about a 

00:03:05.720 --> 00:03:10.849
 lady who makes dresses and they taught me 

00:03:08.390 --> 00:03:12.590
 photos of who makes gorgeous dresses 

00:03:10.849 --> 00:03:15.140
 as haute couture or like 

00:03:12.590 --> 00:03:16.610
 girlfriends went to see her and I took my 

00:03:15.140 --> 00:03:19.340
 my mom's grandmother that the test of 

00:03:16.610 --> 00:03:21.349
 fire to see if yes and it turned out that super 

00:03:19.340 --> 00:03:23.599
 happy I had not liked any 

00:03:21.349 --> 00:03:26.000
 dress up stores like it's hard 

00:03:23.599 --> 00:03:27.769
 like it was from that to see wait eight 

00:03:26.000 --> 00:03:29.810
 months to arrive or six months here 

00:03:27.769 --> 00:03:31.640
 I arrived and what you have to adjust a 

00:03:29.810 --> 00:03:33.349
 a million things because as I am super 

00:03:31.640 --> 00:03:36.290
 short since the waist is in 

00:03:33.349 --> 00:03:38.299
 other places and so then I said no 

00:03:36.290 --> 00:03:39.829
 I'm better one to the measure one that I 

00:03:38.299 --> 00:03:41.840
 one of my style is left to me 

00:03:39.829 --> 00:03:43.450
 you want or not we all want to have something 

00:03:41.840 --> 00:03:45.580
 only 

00:03:43.450 --> 00:03:47.739
 and something different then then the truth 

00:03:45.580 --> 00:03:50.140
 I think my dress did decide better 

00:03:47.739 --> 00:03:52.300
 Send it to me and then right now 

00:03:50.140 --> 00:03:54.550
 be mexico last week i told my 

00:03:52.300 --> 00:03:56.769
 sister hey like if I keep the 

00:03:54.550 --> 00:03:59.650
 little thing of the veil then we went to see it 

00:03:56.769 --> 00:04:01.930
 again I fell in love and it turns out 

00:03:59.650 --> 00:04:02.890
 which is just the same color as the 

00:04:01.930 --> 00:04:04.959
 dress that I will send to make 

00:04:02.890 --> 00:04:06.489
 then I decided to buy it in fact 

00:04:04.959 --> 00:04:08.319
 that's something we see from a lot 

00:04:06.489 --> 00:04:09.940
 then I have the dress and the ball 

00:04:08.319 --> 00:04:11.380
 we are in the talk of the moon of 

00:04:09.940 --> 00:04:13.239
 honey now we still do not know where 

00:04:11.380 --> 00:04:15.069
 we 're going to go too much for 

00:04:13.239 --> 00:04:16.720
 that but well everyone tells me 

00:04:15.069 --> 00:04:18.549
 to miss so much you're going super 

00:04:16.720 --> 00:04:21.190
 fast and the knife and I figured that 

00:04:18.549 --> 00:04:24.090
 yes week super fast thing I think that 

00:04:21.190 --> 00:04:24.090
 It's all about the wedding 

00:04:24.820 --> 00:04:28.170
 I still do not decide who is going to make up 

00:04:26.440 --> 00:04:30.550
 because I have not done makeup tests 

00:04:28.170 --> 00:04:31.960
 but I think if it's definitely not 

00:04:30.550 --> 00:04:34.570
 good idea that I make up because 

00:04:31.960 --> 00:04:36.550
 she is nervous better than they demand to me already 

00:04:34.570 --> 00:04:38.320
 basically I feel that until I already 

00:04:36.550 --> 00:04:41.170
 have the room I tell you that 

00:04:38.320 --> 00:04:43.330
 I still do not have it, I'm going to be able to 

00:04:41.170 --> 00:04:45.460
 and tell them that we choose the 

00:04:43.330 --> 00:04:47.890
 tables and chairs and flowers and 

00:04:45.460 --> 00:04:49.750
 how many people and the speech and but I'm in 

00:04:47.890 --> 00:04:51.550
 a very weird transition like that is already 

00:04:49.750 --> 00:04:54.370
 in the forehead but as it was short of 

00:04:51.550 --> 00:04:55.870
 back this short then I'm having 

00:04:54.370 --> 00:04:57.880
 problems that's why it did not stop me from pity 

00:04:55.870 --> 00:04:59.560
 I hope you liked to know a 

00:04:57.880 --> 00:05:01.840
 little bit more about how we go with the wedding 

00:04:59.560 --> 00:05:03.770
 because they have been asking me a lot and 

00:05:01.840 --> 00:05:05.870
 see you 

00:05:03.770 --> 00:05:08.319
 and see you in the Saturday tutorial 

00:05:05.870 --> 00:05:08.319
 bye
