00:00:01.280 --> 00:00:06.630
 let's happy be removed as the third type of misdemeanor noel decimal newspaper 

00:00:06.630 --> 00:00:07.410
 mix 

00:00:07.410 --> 00:00:10.379
 in let's go with an example 

00:00:10.379 --> 00:00:13.499
 zero with +5 3 3 3 3 3 3 

00:00:14.869 --> 00:00:17.949
 we convert it then between place like in the previous one 

00:00:17.949 --> 00:00:23.230
 type asun hat chance well the c-zero coma 5 3 

00:00:23.230 --> 00:00:26.679
 and the hat notes that it only affects number three 

00:00:26.679 --> 00:00:30.460
 that only indicates that only number 3 is the one that is going 

00:00:30.460 --> 00:00:32.300
 repeating indefinitely 

00:00:32.300 --> 00:00:36.580
 and 5 is not affected by that hat therefore means that the 5 

00:00:36.579 --> 00:00:38.600
 do not repeat 

00:00:38.600 --> 00:00:42.080
 zero coma 5 3 3 3 3 3 would mean 

00:00:44.460 --> 00:00:46.210
 how we turn it look 

00:00:46.210 --> 00:00:51.520
 the part the decimal part the 5 and the sad part in 5 and the 3 

00:00:51.520 --> 00:00:54.520
 we will put it as if it were a man the 53 

00:00:55.060 --> 00:00:57.120
 to that number 53 

00:00:57.120 --> 00:01:00.909
 we are going to subtract the part that does not repeat 

00:01:01.740 --> 00:01:05.740
 who does not repeat remember 5 has not broken 5 does not repeat then 

00:01:06.240 --> 00:01:09.240
 we are going to subtract then 5 

00:01:09.780 --> 00:01:12.660
 and we're going to divide it by how much 

00:01:12.660 --> 00:01:13.570
 between 

00:01:13.570 --> 00:01:16.780
 9 10 I did what I do not understand 

00:01:17.450 --> 00:01:19.980
 you remember when there was a hat 

00:01:19.980 --> 00:01:22.140
 we had to divide between nines 

00:01:22.140 --> 00:01:23.970
 of course 

00:01:23.970 --> 00:01:27.220
 well then how many move we have to put to see 

00:01:27.220 --> 00:01:30.750
 remember how many figures are below the hat under the hat 

00:01:30.750 --> 00:01:32.550
 it's only number three 

00:01:32.550 --> 00:01:35.460
 therefore only spum 

00:01:35.460 --> 00:01:38.460
 then we put in the denominator jun 

00:01:40.260 --> 00:01:44.850
 and we also have the part that is not repeated that would be 5 only a 

00:01:44.850 --> 00:01:49.240
 digit for the digits that do not repeat we must place 6 

00:01:50.190 --> 00:01:54.180
 how many zeros should I place see only 6 5 the one that does not repeat so 

00:01:54.180 --> 00:01:55.020
 so much 

00:01:55.020 --> 00:01:56.620
 A yes 

00:01:56.620 --> 00:01:59.360
 in tobacco we put in 2011 hero 

00:01:59.360 --> 00:02:02.730
 and that is that he is already armed then to see the achievements that do is to lend in the 

00:02:02.730 --> 00:02:07.400
 numerator 53 - five that's 48 out of 90 

00:02:07.400 --> 00:02:12.129
 and simplifies moss this fraction is going to come out eight out of 15 and that's it 

00:02:12.129 --> 00:02:15.229
 alarmed with examples 

00:02:15.229 --> 00:02:20.009
 we have for example 7 as a 3 21 0 2 0 2 0 2 f 

00:02:21.249 --> 00:02:26.599
 we observe here that the part that is repeating is 0 2 0 2 0 2 0 2 0 

00:02:26.599 --> 00:02:28.499
 2 and so on 

00:02:28.499 --> 00:02:32.359
 while there is a part that is not repeating that is the 3 2 1 

00:02:32.989 --> 00:02:36.220
 the next one corresponds to the whole part got fed up of his cd 

00:02:36.769 --> 00:02:38.899
 serra soleÃ¡ pas 

00:02:38.899 --> 00:02:42.359
 to see the first thing then we put it in its rotation with hat there is 

00:02:42.359 --> 00:02:47.379
 seven combats 2 one that is what is not repeated and inside a hat we put 

00:02:47.379 --> 00:02:50.379
 the 0 2 that is what it demands to be repeated 

00:02:51.069 --> 00:02:55.289
 as we transform it attraction to see how the 7 is in the whole part 

00:02:55.289 --> 00:02:58.579
 then we only put as a very famous number auto whole number 

00:02:59.469 --> 00:03:01.379
 7 as an integral part 

00:03:01.379 --> 00:03:06.120
 what we did the decimal part on 3 2 1 0 2 

00:03:06.120 --> 00:03:09.180
 all that makes 32 thousand 102 

00:03:09.699 --> 00:03:14.539
 that we put it as if it were a number not all in 32 thousand 102 

00:03:15.109 --> 00:03:20.289
 and that number we have to subtract we just subtract the part that is not 

00:03:20.289 --> 00:03:21.369
 repeat 

00:03:21.369 --> 00:03:25.449
 who what is not repeated between those two points 

00:03:25.449 --> 00:03:28.449
 then we subtract the 321 

00:03:29.849 --> 00:03:34.129
 and that result then we have to divide it we put a fraction 

00:03:34.129 --> 00:03:37.000
 and we divide it among nine pizzeros 

00:03:37.000 --> 00:03:38.400
 how many furniture 

00:03:38.400 --> 00:03:42.400
 bianco observes then hat how many digits there in the hat 

00:03:42.400 --> 00:03:48.430
 the 0 and the 2 there two digits therefore the '9' and 9 all very same be 

00:03:48.430 --> 00:03:50.759
 all is not because they are two digits that are 

00:03:50.759 --> 00:03:52.889
 within the staff 

00:03:52.889 --> 00:03:57.639
 and how many digits are not repeated that are 3 on 2 and 1 did not get fed up 

00:03:57.639 --> 00:04:00.639
 3 2 and 1 are three figures therefore 13 

00:04:02.409 --> 00:04:06.080
 it is already only I have left then to solve this this small difference 

00:04:06.079 --> 00:04:07.220
 in the numerator 

00:04:07.220 --> 00:04:08.939
 we would have to go whole 

00:04:08.939 --> 00:04:12.389
 thirty-one thousand 781 over 99 

00:04:15.849 --> 00:04:17.409
 we continue 

00:04:17.409 --> 00:04:20.319
 let's see an example made three to finish 

00:04:20.319 --> 00:04:24.499
 we have 2-2 with +4 0 0 6 0 0 6 

00:04:26.419 --> 00:04:31.979
 of thrones here a part that is repeating itself 0 0 6 0 0 6 0 0 6 

00:04:31.979 --> 00:04:33.610
 pesos is repeating true 

00:04:33.610 --> 00:04:36.610
 and there is a non-repeating part that is four 

00:04:37.400 --> 00:04:42.490
 this -2 that is on the left side that's the part where we're fed up not 

00:04:42.490 --> 00:04:44.020
 account 

00:04:44.020 --> 00:04:48.240
 let's see then the -2 points that is part earth 

00:04:48.240 --> 00:04:51.570
 it becomes a whole number not true - all 

00:04:53.069 --> 00:04:54.050
 coma 

00:04:54.050 --> 00:04:55.110
 e 4 

00:04:55.110 --> 00:05:00.699
 and the 0 0 6 then we locked him inside a hat a pig went in hats 

00:05:00.699 --> 00:05:03.439
 of hat means that it is repeated indefinitely 

00:05:03.439 --> 00:05:05.870
 he transformed it saints offered mother cc 

00:05:05.870 --> 00:05:09.840
 -12 is on the left side as they said we put it in 12 common drenthe 

00:05:09.840 --> 00:05:11.240
 - two 

00:05:11.240 --> 00:05:14.949
 and the rest the decimal part we convert it then a fraction 

00:05:14.949 --> 00:05:17.559
 as it becomes quickly fractionable 

00:05:17.559 --> 00:05:19.800
 4 0 0 6 

00:05:19.800 --> 00:05:23.219
 assen the 4006 we put in 12 4006 

00:05:23.949 --> 00:05:28.809
 to that amount we subtract qiang we subtract the part that is not repeated who 

00:05:28.809 --> 00:05:30.550
 the Cuban is not repeated 

00:05:30.550 --> 00:05:33.349
 the '4' then we subtract here 

00:05:33.349 --> 00:05:38.430
 and that result we are going to divide by 9 if you are how many furniture 

00:05:38.430 --> 00:05:42.279
 for being the number of country figures within him of the marrero 

00:05:42.279 --> 00:05:44.529
 the 0 and the 0 26 

00:05:44.529 --> 00:05:45.900
 3 figures 

00:05:45.900 --> 00:05:48.900
 then 3 9 

00:05:49.529 --> 00:05:54.499
 i with the part that is not repeated in this case which they propose we would put 0 

00:05:54.499 --> 00:05:58.459
 sensible how many zeros to see how it is only 4 is a digit nothing 

00:05:58.459 --> 00:05:58.900
 plus 

00:05:58.900 --> 00:06:02.180
 therefore we put ponce 

00:06:02.180 --> 00:06:05.330
 we have then to overcome the difference that in the numerator 

00:06:05.330 --> 00:06:07.300
 we would have less 2 integers 

00:06:07.300 --> 00:06:10.369
 4002 trained in 1990 

00:06:10.369 --> 00:06:12.719
 I could simplify 

00:06:12.719 --> 00:06:13.459
 and you go to ips
