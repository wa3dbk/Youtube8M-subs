00:00:07.160 --> 00:00:13.070
 the new subaru forester like everyone else 

00:00:10.260 --> 00:00:15.870
 subaru with five years full warranty until 

00:00:13.070 --> 00:00:19.460
 160,000 kilometers of reliability 

00:00:15.870 --> 00:00:19.460
 fun makes subaru 

00:00:26.990 --> 00:00:31.950
 in 114 years stuttgart kickers was available 

00:00:30.630 --> 00:00:34.380
 never had one before 

00:00:31.950 --> 00:00:36.510
 clash with the rb leipzig 

00:00:34.380 --> 00:00:38.070
 as a clear underdog drove the kickers 

00:00:36.510 --> 00:00:40.020
 on saturday on the last round of the matchday 

00:00:38.070 --> 00:00:40.830
 to the away game in the east 

00:00:40.020 --> 00:00:43.290
 germany 

00:00:40.830 --> 00:00:45.989
 this should be another premiere come 

00:00:43.290 --> 00:00:48.330
 finally an away win that was in 

00:00:45.989 --> 00:00:49.710
 this season not yet coach horst 

00:00:48.330 --> 00:00:51.629
 Steffen was also able to do so in the 

00:00:49.710 --> 00:00:53.670
 Offensive again from the full draw 

00:00:51.629 --> 00:00:55.739
 And so was Elia Soriano 

00:00:53.670 --> 00:00:57.390
 dismissed yellow barrier again from 

00:00:55.739 --> 00:01:00.270
 at the beginning of the course 

00:00:57.390 --> 00:01:01.230
 the hosts came in front of 7000 spectators 

00:01:00.270 --> 00:01:04.320
 better into the game 

00:01:01.230 --> 00:01:06.509
 here it often fails breaks markus 

00:01:04.320 --> 00:01:09.180
 frizzy from the beginning on wide awake 

00:01:06.509 --> 00:01:11.160
 the kickers came in the first 20 

00:01:09.180 --> 00:01:13.740
 no minutes at all 

00:01:11.160 --> 00:01:15.990
 almost logical then the scene of the 21st 

00:01:13.740 --> 00:01:19.470
 minute as Clemens foundrich the ball 

00:01:15.990 --> 00:01:22.830
 soulful to denis thomalla air and 

00:01:19.470 --> 00:01:24.930
 the network was the early residue of the svk 

00:01:22.830 --> 00:01:27.600
 but here is the logical consequence 

00:01:24.930 --> 00:01:29.369
 Passivity after half an hour 

00:01:27.600 --> 00:01:31.950
 then finally the kickers on the 

00:01:29.369 --> 00:01:34.050
 advance with the pass on mÃ¼ller and 

00:01:31.950 --> 00:01:36.119
 immediately the whistle he should have been offside 

00:01:34.050 --> 00:01:37.649
 to be good in slow motion here 

00:01:36.119 --> 00:01:39.509
 it was a mistake and 

00:01:37.649 --> 00:01:41.459
 prevented one hundred percent 

00:01:39.509 --> 00:01:42.929
 chance for the blue just a minute 

00:01:41.459 --> 00:01:45.899
 later on the other side with 

00:01:42.929 --> 00:01:47.310
 the header of tobias dorfer it remained 

00:01:45.899 --> 00:01:49.649
 at 1 0 

00:01:47.310 --> 00:01:51.280
 we just need our captain 

00:01:49.649 --> 00:01:53.799
 enzo marchese the 

00:01:51.280 --> 00:01:57.190
 you get the ball off well 

00:01:53.799 --> 00:01:59.830
 lets and sinks ice cold insanely 

00:01:57.190 --> 00:02:04.500
 action from the cheese and suddenly something 

00:01:59.830 --> 00:02:04.500
 surprising balance for the kickers 

00:02:11.900 --> 00:02:15.680
 the kickers have a lot of space at least 

00:02:13.819 --> 00:02:17.989
 in the fanblock even if large free spaces 

00:02:15.680 --> 00:02:19.790
 would have been more important in the field 

00:02:17.989 --> 00:02:22.220
 At least the kickers were allowed to play 

00:02:19.790 --> 00:02:23.870
 trailers wide shortly after 

00:02:22.220 --> 00:02:26.959
 The red bulls started again on the 

00:02:23.870 --> 00:02:29.810
 with breaks was the stag 

00:02:26.959 --> 00:02:32.569
 pretty well served and with a good eye 

00:02:29.810 --> 00:02:35.209
 on the freestanding andrÃ© luge and he 

00:02:32.569 --> 00:02:37.760
 Take the leather well and sunk 

00:02:35.209 --> 00:02:40.340
 Here you have the hat before the leipziger 

00:02:37.760 --> 00:02:42.439
 pull good action though patrick 

00:02:40.340 --> 00:02:43.099
 auracher something too careful to work 

00:02:42.439 --> 00:02:45.019
 going 

00:02:43.099 --> 00:02:47.780
 then came the same for him 

00:02:45.019 --> 00:02:51.049
 matchwinner of the last match marianne 

00:02:47.780 --> 00:02:53.500
 and he gets it right up 

00:02:51.049 --> 00:02:56.420
 to deliver a good match 

00:02:53.500 --> 00:02:59.239
 marco calamita when the meantime for 

00:02:56.420 --> 00:03:01.040
 elia soriano in the square and had 

00:02:59.239 --> 00:03:04.220
 here in one-on-one against erik 

00:03:01.040 --> 00:03:05.959
 domaschke also the chance his 

00:03:04.220 --> 00:03:06.620
 first hit for the blue ones too 

00:03:05.959 --> 00:03:09.200
 achieve 

00:03:06.620 --> 00:03:11.000
 Horst Steffen had everything again 

00:03:09.200 --> 00:03:12.680
 risked and yet another point of 

00:03:11.000 --> 00:03:14.359
 force it in the end, it was not enough 

00:03:12.680 --> 00:03:15.919
 and the kickers need to continue on the 

00:03:14.359 --> 00:03:17.959
 wait for first victory away 

00:03:15.919 --> 00:03:20.000
 At home, they can do it all the better 

00:03:17.959 --> 00:03:22.609
 that's five times already 

00:03:20.000 --> 00:03:24.199
 happy end in the walder stadium given and 

00:03:22.609 --> 00:03:26.150
 that's what the blue ones from waldau want 

00:03:24.199 --> 00:03:27.980
 last week against the table sieve 

00:03:26.150 --> 00:03:29.750
 repeat again 

00:03:27.980 --> 00:03:31.760
 Everyone is also hot on the 

00:03:29.750 --> 00:03:34.190
 revenge in the away game it set one 

00:03:31.760 --> 00:03:37.120
 sensitive 14 0 defeat against the 

00:03:34.190 --> 00:03:37.120
 sv blown wiesbaden 

00:03:47.200 --> 00:03:53.110
