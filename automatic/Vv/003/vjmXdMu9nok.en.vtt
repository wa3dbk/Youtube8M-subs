00:00:08.480 --> 00:00:13.049
 In 1964 the first ford came on 

00:00:11.040 --> 00:00:15.269
 Since then the market has become an icon 

00:00:13.049 --> 00:00:17.039
 After 50 years, there is now the first time 

00:00:15.269 --> 00:00:18.420
 possibility for german customers to you 

00:00:17.039 --> 00:00:20.250
 to buy directly at ford 

00:00:18.420 --> 00:00:22.800
 previously this was only possible over 

00:00:20.250 --> 00:00:24.480
 importers from the usa because so too 

00:00:22.800 --> 00:00:26.160
 especially when I have my colleagues 

00:00:24.480 --> 00:00:27.840
 especially because I envy this 

00:00:26.160 --> 00:00:30.410
 dare to drive alone this sound 

00:00:27.840 --> 00:00:30.410
 listen 

00:00:38.859 --> 00:00:43.760
 a colleague with whom you steal horses 

00:00:41.690 --> 00:00:44.329
 can be tanja else said 

00:00:43.760 --> 00:00:46.670
 presented 

00:00:44.329 --> 00:00:48.530
 excite against use of the opportunity 

00:00:46.670 --> 00:00:53.110
 and is pleased about a spontaneous 

00:00:48.530 --> 00:00:53.110
 eye test drive in five liter v8 

00:00:53.940 --> 00:00:58.750
 yes good curve behavior in the 

00:00:56.920 --> 00:01:00.070
 that's what American authors say 

00:00:58.750 --> 00:01:04.590
 not so good now here comes unfortunately 

00:01:00.070 --> 00:01:04.590
 also a curve but I have to say 

00:01:05.010 --> 00:01:08.040
 actually all quite so easily 

00:01:06.780 --> 00:01:09.390
 you can do that too 

00:01:08.040 --> 00:01:12.420
 Sporty around the curves drive now 

00:01:09.390 --> 00:01:13.830
 not only for the even built with 

00:01:12.420 --> 00:01:16.380
 Toggle switches in the center console 

00:01:13.830 --> 00:01:18.630
 can be both steerings as well 

00:01:16.380 --> 00:01:19.380
 responsiveness of the engine sporty 

00:01:18.630 --> 00:01:22.500
 to adjust 

00:01:19.380 --> 00:01:25.200
 whether comfortable or just the need 

00:01:22.500 --> 00:01:27.120
 then both can and andre wants his 

00:01:25.200 --> 00:01:29.390
 I do not need to get out so fast 

00:01:27.120 --> 00:01:29.390
 move 

00:01:48.790 --> 00:01:52.510
 the mustang is an absolute one 

00:01:50.590 --> 00:01:54.490
 There are currently no prizes available 

00:01:52.510 --> 00:01:57.370
 actually no other car with v8 

00:01:54.490 --> 00:01:59.680
 engine for only 40,000 euros in germany 

00:01:57.370 --> 00:02:01.870
 and he has everything in it, too 

00:01:59.680 --> 00:02:04.030
 leather steering wheel automatic climate control and 

00:02:01.870 --> 00:02:06.220
 voice control are two are 

00:02:04.030 --> 00:02:08.229
 standard in the price list in 

00:02:06.220 --> 00:02:11.470
 Germany is therefore quite short 

00:02:08.229 --> 00:02:12.130
 the co2 output of 2 199 grams per 

00:02:11.470 --> 00:02:15.300
 kilometre 

00:02:12.130 --> 00:02:15.300
 against it violently 

00:02:26.700 --> 00:02:33.190
 the press mustang gt was really good 

00:02:30.510 --> 00:02:35.590
 the v8 engine with a displacement of five liters 

00:02:33.190 --> 00:02:38.170
 has an absolute maximum 

00:02:35.590 --> 00:02:41.740
 torque of 530 newton meters 

00:02:38.170 --> 00:02:45.520
 the top speed 250 km h the 

00:02:41.740 --> 00:02:46.960
 Dare made a lot of fun with the engine 

00:02:45.520 --> 00:02:49.920
 you already have that certain level in the 

00:02:46.960 --> 00:02:52.510
 performance is thus up to 3000 

00:02:49.920 --> 00:02:55.500
 The sea is so comfortable cruising though 

00:02:52.510 --> 00:02:55.500
 from 3,000 

00:02:56.690 --> 00:03:00.560
 then this is really like you would 

00:02:58.160 --> 00:03:03.050
 then it has to be properly doped 

00:03:00.560 --> 00:03:04.610
 sit and just ride in the prairie 

00:03:03.050 --> 00:03:06.410
 and behind you are already 417 

00:03:04.610 --> 00:03:08.770
 other wild horses just go ahead 

00:03:06.410 --> 00:03:08.770
 dash 

00:03:19.209 --> 00:03:23.239
 So the circuit here has to say this 

00:03:21.860 --> 00:03:24.140
 really something in my eyes 

00:03:23.239 --> 00:03:26.510
 special 

00:03:24.140 --> 00:03:29.150
 that has really nice short 

00:03:26.510 --> 00:03:30.680
 however, the point is that the 

00:03:29.150 --> 00:03:33.709
 It is relatively questionable that you are there too 

00:03:30.680 --> 00:03:35.599
 must go right and switch 

00:03:33.709 --> 00:03:37.340
 in any other car you would get this one 

00:03:35.599 --> 00:03:39.109
 circuit damn and complete 

00:03:37.340 --> 00:03:41.239
 find it bad but it just fits 

00:03:39.109 --> 00:03:42.319
 Like a fist on the eye because there is 

00:03:41.239 --> 00:03:43.970
 such a bit the feeling of 

00:03:42.319 --> 00:03:47.230
 Mustang is a car for rock hard 

00:03:43.970 --> 00:03:47.230
 men or women of steel 

00:03:48.370 --> 00:03:53.120
 During the design Ford has over the years 

00:03:51.230 --> 00:03:57.310
 made many experiments but now 

00:03:53.120 --> 00:03:57.310
 it's back to the roots again 

00:04:00.130 --> 00:04:04.940
 The very first mustang is to this day 

00:04:02.390 --> 00:04:06.230
 a design icon that's why 

00:04:04.940 --> 00:04:08.300
 fort successful for several years 

00:04:06.230 --> 00:04:09.200
 on it the old line guidance again 

00:04:08.300 --> 00:04:10.280
 to revive 

00:04:09.200 --> 00:04:11.750
 she has a huge one, too 

00:04:10.280 --> 00:04:13.580
 Recognizable even in children 

00:04:11.750 --> 00:04:15.140
 and I think that it worked so well 

00:04:13.580 --> 00:04:17.770
 with the new model , let's take a look 

00:04:15.140 --> 00:04:17.770
 take a closer look 

00:04:17.799 --> 00:04:23.420
 the name has the must then from 

00:04:19.940 --> 00:04:25.430
 fighter plane b51 pattern anyway 

00:04:23.420 --> 00:04:28.040
 the galloping horse heraldic animal of the 

00:04:25.430 --> 00:04:29.690
 American sports car has become there 

00:04:28.040 --> 00:04:32.480
 he must then actually for 

00:04:29.690 --> 00:04:34.700
 but he also had designed women 

00:04:32.480 --> 00:04:36.320
 he can be called ford stiletto 

00:04:34.700 --> 00:04:37.490
 he developed into a car that 

00:04:36.320 --> 00:04:40.010
 men and women alike 

00:04:37.490 --> 00:04:43.270
 especially fascinated with the fastback 

00:04:40.010 --> 00:04:43.270
 called coupe version 

00:04:44.379 --> 00:04:49.340
 in the interior there are songs elements 

00:04:47.539 --> 00:04:52.819
 but not real aluminum but 

00:04:49.340 --> 00:04:56.090
 mainly plastic the recaro 

00:04:52.819 --> 00:05:04.759
 shell seats in leather cost 1800 euro 

00:04:56.090 --> 00:05:08.379
 An extra start button will wake up that 

00:05:04.759 --> 00:05:08.379
 massive engine from his sleep 

00:05:16.500 --> 00:05:23.620
 Mist totally forgot gt is indeed for 

00:05:21.850 --> 00:05:25.180
 grandtour so a car with the synonymous 

00:05:23.620 --> 00:05:26.250
 can handle big trips and me 

00:05:25.180 --> 00:05:30.820
 have to say 

00:05:26.250 --> 00:05:37.840
 despite the fastback shape is indeed so 

00:05:30.820 --> 00:05:40.180
 inject some pure with each quantity 

00:05:37.840 --> 00:05:44.260
 In the luggage , another man drives in the direction of one 

00:05:40.180 --> 00:05:45.910
 conclusion so good for reason people is 

00:05:44.260 --> 00:05:47.950
 the mustang with the v8 mother of course 

00:05:45.910 --> 00:05:51.100
 absolutely nothing 

00:05:47.950 --> 00:05:54.400
 the consumption is with us in test 16 

00:05:51.100 --> 00:05:56.320
 meters are really pretty clear 

00:05:54.400 --> 00:05:58.690
 is also a huge engine but what 

00:05:56.320 --> 00:05:59.980
 you get a sound for that and then 

00:05:58.690 --> 00:06:01.450
 fun and a bit like that 

00:05:59.980 --> 00:06:04.090
 a sense of life what must stop then 

00:06:01.450 --> 00:06:06.160
 mediates and that for the really 

00:06:04.090 --> 00:06:08.410
 dumpingpreis the ford because quasi 

00:06:06.160 --> 00:06:09.850
 label so it really the madness I can 

00:06:08.410 --> 00:06:11.920
 I do not imagine that one with this 

00:06:09.850 --> 00:06:13.320
 car does not have fun there you have to be 

00:06:11.920 --> 00:06:18.520
 the gas station 

00:06:13.320 --> 00:06:20.980
 another petrol station is ultimately 

00:06:18.520 --> 00:06:23.290
 but so nice and brings to susanne hot 

00:06:20.980 --> 00:06:24.910
 longed for the test car without the 

00:06:23.290 --> 00:06:28.030
 Sleep of just destruction understands 

00:06:24.910 --> 00:06:29.260
 Incidentally, there are for 35,000 euros 

00:06:28.030 --> 00:06:31.810
 the patterns also with ecoboost 

00:06:29.260 --> 00:06:35.280
 four-cylinder with a consumption of 8 

00:06:31.810 --> 00:06:35.280
 liters at 100 kilometers 

00:06:53.689 --> 00:06:56.809
 is yes
