my favorite ones how to easily build
nesting<00:01:19.080> box<00:01:19.259> data<00:01:19.500> common<00:01:19.920> materials

00:01:20.510 --> 00:01:20.520 
nesting box data common materials

00:01:20.520 --> 00:01:22.910 
nesting box data common materials
there's<00:01:21.240> no<00:01:21.390> reason<00:01:21.780> to<00:01:21.810> go<00:01:22.049> out<00:01:22.170> and<00:01:22.530> spend

00:01:22.910 --> 00:01:22.920 
there's no reason to go out and spend

00:01:22.920 --> 00:01:26.149 
there's no reason to go out and spend
time<00:01:23.040> and<00:01:23.460> they're<00:01:24.119> building<00:01:25.049> the<00:01:25.170> nesting

00:01:26.149 --> 00:01:26.159 
time and they're building the nesting

00:01:26.159 --> 00:01:27.920 
time and they're building the nesting
boxes<00:01:26.460> are<00:01:26.610> usually<00:01:26.939> the<00:01:26.970> fiddly<00:01:27.390> spit<00:01:27.689> seeds

00:01:27.920 --> 00:01:27.930 
boxes are usually the fiddly spit seeds

00:01:27.930 --> 00:01:30.200 
boxes are usually the fiddly spit seeds
it's<00:01:28.590> like<00:01:28.799> building<00:01:29.009> building<00:01:29.640> a<00:01:29.729> table<00:01:29.909> and

00:01:30.200 --> 00:01:30.210 
it's like building building a table and

00:01:30.210 --> 00:01:32.330 
it's like building building a table and
chairs<00:01:30.479> that<00:01:30.780> the<00:01:31.380> chairs<00:01:31.650> are<00:01:31.799> smaller<00:01:32.070> but

00:01:32.330 --> 00:01:32.340 
chairs that the chairs are smaller but

00:01:32.340 --> 00:01:33.620 
chairs that the chairs are smaller but
they're<00:01:32.610> more<00:01:32.759> fiddly<00:01:33.150> and<00:01:33.180> they'll<00:01:33.390> take

00:01:33.620 --> 00:01:33.630 
they're more fiddly and they'll take

00:01:33.630 --> 00:01:35.660 
they're more fiddly and they'll take
yours<00:01:33.840> one<00:01:34.380> chair<00:01:34.619> will<00:01:34.799> take<00:01:34.950> yours<00:01:35.159> as<00:01:35.610> long

00:01:35.660 --> 00:01:35.670 
yours one chair will take yours as long

00:01:35.670 --> 00:01:38.569 
yours one chair will take yours as long
to<00:01:36.030> build<00:01:36.150> as<00:01:36.390> a<00:01:36.630> table<00:01:37.140> would<00:01:37.340> actually<00:01:38.340> it

00:01:38.569 --> 00:01:38.579 
to build as a table would actually it

00:01:38.579 --> 00:01:40.310 
to build as a table would actually it
would<00:01:38.909> probably<00:01:39.119> take<00:01:39.270> you<00:01:39.450> even<00:01:39.479> longer<00:01:39.960> so

00:01:40.310 --> 00:01:40.320 
would probably take you even longer so

00:01:40.320 --> 00:01:42.230 
would probably take you even longer so
it's<00:01:40.829> the<00:01:41.009> small<00:01:41.310> fiddly<00:01:41.700> things<00:01:41.909> that<00:01:42.060> take

00:01:42.230 --> 00:01:42.240 
it's the small fiddly things that take

00:01:42.240 --> 00:01:44.960 
it's the small fiddly things that take
the<00:01:42.390> longest<00:01:42.420> in<00:01:42.899> and<00:01:43.430> you're<00:01:44.430> lucky<00:01:44.729> with<00:01:44.880> the

00:01:44.960 --> 00:01:44.970 
the longest in and you're lucky with the

00:01:44.970 --> 00:01:46.039 
the longest in and you're lucky with the
nesting<00:01:45.299> boxes<00:01:45.540> because<00:01:45.720> you<00:01:45.869> can<00:01:46.020> just

00:01:46.039 --> 00:01:46.049 
nesting boxes because you can just

00:01:46.049 --> 00:01:49.100 
nesting boxes because you can just
recycle<00:01:46.770> products<00:01:47.420> existing<00:01:48.420> things<00:01:48.630> you've

00:01:49.100 --> 00:01:49.110 
recycle products existing things you've

00:01:49.110 --> 00:01:50.960 
recycle products existing things you've
got<00:01:49.320> in<00:01:49.439> your<00:01:49.470> shed<00:01:49.770> or<00:01:49.979> lying<00:01:50.610> around<00:01:50.820> your

all this material but you know you could

00:01:57.450 --> 00:02:00.590 
all this material but you know you could
use<00:01:57.600> something<00:01:57.869> like<00:01:57.990> an<00:01:58.259> old<00:01:58.439> tire<00:01:59.600> they're

00:02:00.590 --> 00:02:00.600
