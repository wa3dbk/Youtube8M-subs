 chocolates that are too rich 

00:00:12.120 --> 00:00:17.160
 delicious they are like to suck 

00:00:15.049 --> 00:00:20.350
 literally the fingers and I'm talking 

00:00:17.160 --> 00:00:22.450
 of these little bombs 

00:00:20.350 --> 00:00:26.090
 look at this we do not need to know 

00:00:22.450 --> 00:00:29.750
 too delicious are some chocolates 

00:00:26.090 --> 00:00:31.880
 heart-shaped and they are filled and they are 

00:00:29.750 --> 00:00:34.630
 too rich and I finished chocolate 

00:00:31.880 --> 00:00:37.160
 white and dark chocolate and they're 

00:00:34.630 --> 00:00:39.830
 delicious and if you want to know what 

00:00:37.160 --> 00:00:42.530
 they're stuffed and how can you do it in 

00:00:39.830 --> 00:00:44.000
 your house that are super easy stay in 

00:00:42.530 --> 00:00:46.520
 the video 

00:00:44.000 --> 00:00:48.620
 for this delicious recipe we are going to 

00:00:46.520 --> 00:00:50.930
 need chocolate bars to 

00:00:48.620 --> 00:00:53.300
 melt to the colors flavors that more 

00:00:50.930 --> 00:00:57.380
 you like your favorite jam in my 

00:00:53.300 --> 00:00:59.300
 condensed milk fig and some 

00:00:57.380 --> 00:01:02.420
 silicone molds of the figurines or 

00:00:59.300 --> 00:01:03.890
 ways that you like the first thing that 

00:01:02.420 --> 00:01:05.570
 let's do is put to melt 

00:01:03.890 --> 00:01:07.280
 our chocolate that in my case I'm going 

00:01:05.570 --> 00:01:09.110
 to do in the microwave and I'm going to 

00:01:07.280 --> 00:01:11.210
 do in a pot that is safe to 

00:01:09.110 --> 00:01:14.720
 use in the microwave and we 're going to 

00:01:11.210 --> 00:01:16.700
 do 30 to 30 seconds each time 

00:01:14.720 --> 00:01:18.979
 we make sure that we do not burn 

00:01:16.700 --> 00:01:21.050
 chocolate and I will repeat the same 

00:01:18.979 --> 00:01:25.119
 procedure with both chocolate 

00:01:21.050 --> 00:01:25.119
 black as with my white chocolate 

00:01:26.350 --> 00:01:31.900
 we put it in the microwave 30 seconds 

00:01:29.080 --> 00:01:34.540
 we beat until we have a mixture 

00:01:31.900 --> 00:01:36.100
 super liquid if you see that one is what 

00:01:34.540 --> 00:01:38.440
 sufficiently liquid you can 

00:01:36.100 --> 00:01:40.390
 add a little vegetable oil or 

00:01:38.440 --> 00:01:41.770
 jordi ning of the brand that I'm going to 

00:01:40.390 --> 00:01:44.340
 leave below that is the one that most 

00:01:41.770 --> 00:01:44.340
 do they work 

00:01:45.390 --> 00:01:49.590
 once we have our mix ready 

00:01:47.729 --> 00:01:51.180
 but we are going to warn you in our 

00:01:49.590 --> 00:01:53.460
 mold and in this case I'm using 

00:01:51.180 --> 00:01:55.560
 one of silicon in the shape of hearts 

00:01:53.460 --> 00:02:00.290
 then we are going to put a first layer 

00:01:55.560 --> 00:02:00.290
 finite chocolate in the background 

00:02:02.510 --> 00:02:06.650
 and once we have all the funds 

00:02:04.790 --> 00:02:09.380
 covered now let's move on to 

00:02:06.650 --> 00:02:11.900
 put the chocolate filling in this 

00:02:09.380 --> 00:02:14.450
 case I am using the jam of 

00:02:11.900 --> 00:02:16.340
 fig for white chocolate and then 

00:02:14.450 --> 00:02:18.710
 I'm going to add some milk 

00:02:16.340 --> 00:02:21.380
 condensed for my black chocolate me 

00:02:18.710 --> 00:02:23.630
 I think this contrast is perfect for 

00:02:21.380 --> 00:02:25.880
 our chocolates make sure to throw it out 

00:02:23.630 --> 00:02:29.680
 enough but not too much so that 

00:02:25.880 --> 00:02:29.680
 is going to drip on the chocolate 

00:02:37.400 --> 00:02:41.730
 after we already have the whole center 

00:02:40.080 --> 00:02:43.920
 of our chocolate ready now we are going to 

00:02:41.730 --> 00:02:45.690
 add the cap of the part of 

00:02:43.920 --> 00:02:47.430
 up and this is very easy the only thing that 

00:02:45.690 --> 00:02:48.860
 we have to do is pour more 

00:02:47.430 --> 00:02:51.660
 chocolate that is completely 

00:02:48.860 --> 00:02:53.730
 covered now let's give it as a few 

00:02:51.660 --> 00:02:55.860
 taps against the table to be 

00:02:53.730 --> 00:02:57.030
 go all the air bubbles and not 

00:02:55.860 --> 00:02:59.630
 we are small holes in our 

00:02:57.030 --> 00:02:59.630
 chocolate 

00:02:59.930 --> 00:03:03.950
 and we're going to put it about an hour 

00:03:02.480 --> 00:03:06.519
 in our fridge or in our 

00:03:03.950 --> 00:03:06.519
 freezer 

00:03:07.980 --> 00:03:11.670
 once our crimes are already 

00:03:09.750 --> 00:03:14.720
 chocolates we will take them as if 

00:03:11.670 --> 00:03:14.720
 they were ice cubes 

00:03:15.490 --> 00:03:19.720
 first we are going to give him a few taps 

00:03:17.660 --> 00:03:22.670
 to help us loosen up and then 

00:03:19.720 --> 00:03:24.680
 we will easily get important 

00:03:22.670 --> 00:03:26.360
 use the silicon mold to be able to 

00:03:24.680 --> 00:03:28.030
 do this and that we do not stay 

00:03:26.360 --> 00:03:30.010
 stuck 

00:03:28.030 --> 00:03:32.920
 and once we finish like this they have to 

00:03:30.010 --> 00:03:36.990
 create our chocolates look beautiful 

00:03:32.920 --> 00:03:36.990
 but the best thing is that they are delicious 

00:03:37.780 --> 00:03:41.770
