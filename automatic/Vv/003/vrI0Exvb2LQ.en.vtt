00:01:59.450 --> 00:01:59.460 
ridiculous and we'll see if we can get a

00:01:59.460 --> 00:02:01.490 
ridiculous and we'll see if we can get a
goal<00:01:59.700> with<00:01:59.880> him<00:02:00.030> but<00:02:00.780> on<00:02:00.899> the<00:02:01.020> right<00:02:01.170> middle<00:02:01.350> we

bonus I kept him there you'll still get

00:02:08.099 --> 00:02:10.100 
bonus I kept him there you'll still get
the<00:02:08.220> line<00:02:08.369> chemistry<00:02:08.610> and<00:02:09.060> they're<00:02:09.750> all<00:02:09.869> most

00:02:10.100 --> 00:02:10.110 
the line chemistry and they're all most

00:02:10.110 --> 00:02:11.029 
the line chemistry and they're all most

to right winger in the future so that's

00:02:12.510 --> 00:02:13.789 
to right winger in the future so that's
the<00:02:12.629> reason<00:02:12.659> why<00:02:12.870> I<00:02:12.959> didn't<00:02:13.200> want<00:02:13.260> to<00:02:13.439> convert

but<00:02:46.109> the<00:02:46.769> fitness<00:02:47.159> were<00:02:47.280> not<00:02:47.670> exactly<00:02:48.239> the

00:02:48.349 --> 00:02:48.359 
but the fitness were not exactly the

00:02:48.359 --> 00:02:50.149 
but the fitness were not exactly the
best<00:02:48.389> of<00:02:48.750> every<00:02:48.989> single<00:02:49.139> player<00:02:49.500> so<00:02:49.709> I<00:02:49.769> decided
