 I'll be different - we're here with an update how and I suppose you started 

00:00:13.500 --> 00:00:18.570
 intuited by the images you see is a definitely bluetooth earphone 

00:00:18.570 --> 00:00:23.630
 compact ikea also light as we now try to show you 

00:00:29.329 --> 00:00:34.340
 come we are for under 14 grams so if a weight decidedly 

00:00:34.339 --> 00:00:39.239
 acceptable datacenter support through. the coupling to the pavilion 

00:00:39.239 --> 00:00:43.340
 earphone that happens comet. you can already imagine from the form 

00:00:43.340 --> 00:00:45.270
 here comes in practice 

00:00:45.270 --> 00:00:49.470
 the thickest weather part adjusts behind the ear 

00:00:49.470 --> 00:00:55.870
 &amp; lt with that, we have used cwc io for several weeks 

00:00:55.870 --> 00:00:58.300
 personally I found myself particularly worthy 

00:00:58.300 --> 00:01:03.100
 in one of the best TVs now tried until I envy your own 

00:01:03.100 --> 00:01:07.250
 and it is not because of whom the text is a girl from the point of view of quality 

00:01:07.250 --> 00:01:10.789
 sound of the community in the state world 

00:01:10.789 --> 00:01:15.079
 and above all I lost the ability to stay attached to the ear is a 

00:01:15.079 --> 00:01:20.160
 good descendant the fact of having this soft part as drinks 

00:01:20.160 --> 00:01:22.860
 it allows him in practice for three 

00:01:22.860 --> 00:01:26.290
 lay it on your nick and without any particular problems 

00:01:26.290 --> 00:01:31.640
 and also with good comfort the little part in cl as you see octopus also 

00:01:31.640 --> 00:01:34.640
 move no down without 

00:01:36.080 --> 00:01:39.390
 particular difficulties it is enough to simply grasp 

00:01:39.390 --> 00:01:43.750
 echat move it to the position. that you feel more comfortable tell me it is 

00:01:43.750 --> 00:01:44.870

00:01:44.870 --> 00:01:51.370
 guaranteed compliance. that sends this little bit that yes 

00:01:51.370 --> 00:01:55.700
 attacks. alarms to the speaker and pachuche to be inserted inside 

00:01:55.700 --> 00:01:58.700
 of yours and that the fact of being so cd with r in the kill 

00:01:59.590 --> 00:02:02.140
 of the particularly comfortable earpiece 

00:02:02.140 --> 00:02:07.080
 as then you can see the amci we succeed here and in this case 

00:02:08.989 --> 00:02:13.779
 we then have not compact relative. the acquisition of the audio equally 

00:02:13.779 --> 00:02:15.399
 efficient 

00:02:15.399 --> 00:02:19.749
 with the various coaches with whom we are talking 

00:02:19.749 --> 00:02:23.959
 now. this particular bluetooth connection appreciated 

00:02:23.959 --> 00:02:27.539
 they always told me. that the car looks good 

00:02:27.539 --> 00:02:29.630
 or done with fellow pausins ​​no 

00:02:29.630 --> 00:02:34.750
 around colleague ddlfantay phoned titan quest earphone and I confirm in

 first person 

00:02:35.629 --> 00:02:38.059
 sound card for it feels good 

00:02:38.059 --> 00:02:43.540
 it is not metallic it will not make it clear obviously only when to operate ad 

00:02:43.539 --> 00:02:46.339
 earpiece reaches the limit of 

00:02:46.339 --> 00:02:51.809
 10 meters distance by phone but this is a limit of 

00:02:51.809 --> 00:02:55.499
 bluetooth protocol mendel phone internal numbers headset 

00:02:56.079 --> 00:02:58.759
 and then sad city interview 

00:02:58.759 --> 00:03:03.909
 autonomy supports almost 3 4 people to use their flat alessio nardo 

00:03:03.909 --> 00:03:06.639
 day we used to do these tests 

00:03:06.639 --> 00:03:12.320
 one night and seven of agate connected. several days as mentioned 

00:03:12.320 --> 00:03:16.650
 and has always done inside wall of carrots 3 days connecting all day 

00:03:16.650 --> 00:03:17.709
 of the fairies 

00:03:17.709 --> 00:03:22.949
 and octopus simply put it in charge using relative 

00:03:22.949 --> 00:03:25.809
 battery charger 

00:03:25.809 --> 00:03:27.639
 arcades na 

00:03:27.639 --> 00:03:29.409
 micro usp 

00:03:29.409 --> 00:03:34.329
 having said that through this button you go to turn on 

00:03:34.329 --> 00:03:39.060
 the earpiece and with this balance ask you to go and manage the 

00:03:39.059 --> 00:03:42.589
 volume then you also have a pair of bluetooth battery indicator 

00:03:43.819 --> 00:03:48.989
 in practice they easily indicate the state and the earpiece fc 

00:03:48.989 --> 00:03:51.989
 you have to use it if much else to tell you god. 

00:03:52.849 --> 00:03:56.000
 I was very satisfied. small e 

00:03:56.000 --> 00:03:57.219

00:03:59.090 --> 00:04:01.109
 lc8 I've had so far 

00:04:01.109 --> 00:04:04.789
 whether it was battery life, ask for the sound quality 

00:04:04.789 --> 00:04:06.650

 yes even for the community in your time wear made of elena. a microphone 

00:04:11.779 --> 00:04:15.819
 not compact and hotel inserted in one shot particularly short enough 

00:04:15.819 --> 00:04:18.749
 pronounced approaching. cheek 

00:04:18.749 --> 00:04:23.080
 A lot of helpers for me is perception. of the item 

00:04:23.080 --> 00:04:29.449
 in this case, it goes to process the background noise they seek. to eliminate the 

00:04:29.449 --> 00:04:33.379
 limit is particularly the voice of the speaker in any case 

00:04:33.379 --> 00:04:35.840
 on the end of the microphone 

00:04:35.840 --> 00:04:40.320
 It is possible to insert a small sponge cap I never have 

00:04:40.320 --> 00:04:44.420
 felt the need to put into practice I realized that it would protect 

00:04:44.419 --> 00:04:47.419
 the microphones extremely windy days for example 

00:04:48.590 --> 00:04:55.050
 when you're in trieste, pull the bora and maybe do 80 100 120 times a 

00:04:55.050 --> 00:04:59.560
 quantity becomes decidedly anomalous in these contexts it could be like 

00:04:59.560 --> 00:05:00.999
 use the tip 

00:05:00.999 --> 00:05:03.770
 but the newspaper also tried me personally 

00:05:03.770 --> 00:05:07.979
 such as days. milan milan metro rather than 

00:05:07.979 --> 00:05:09.900
 after all contest 

00:05:09.900 --> 00:05:16.430
 am exposed how many wind visits on the lake absolutely nothing to say as well 

00:05:16.430 --> 00:05:18.249
 kiss that comes 

00:05:18.249 --> 00:05:20.770
 of advice. of 3 points to give 

00:05:20.770 --> 00:05:25.800
 the support in cells that you see here to insert the headset inside the 

00:05:25.800 --> 00:05:29.020
 your old once you find the purple position 

00:05:30.099 --> 00:05:34.400
 of the scordete of worn but in fact I happened to forget about 

00:05:34.399 --> 00:05:39.009
 have the earpiece and that reminded me of having it anyway 

00:05:39.009 --> 00:05:42.319
 fact that when I arrive, for example, I get a call through fa 

00:05:42.319 --> 00:05:47.050
 buhbuhbutter gets right into my ear in my middle class 

00:05:47.050 --> 00:05:49.930
 why night. buy features 

00:05:49.930 --> 00:05:53.830
 in any case I personally found myself particularly recommending it 

00:05:53.830 --> 00:05:55.009
