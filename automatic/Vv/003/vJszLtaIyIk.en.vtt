all<00:00:00.780> right<00:00:00.960> here<00:00:01.230> is<00:00:01.380> the<00:00:01.460> Tribble

00:00:02.889 --> 00:00:02.899 
all right here is the Tribble

00:00:02.899 --> 00:00:06.909 
all right here is the Tribble
proof-of-concept<00:00:05.299> risen<00:00:06.299> from<00:00:06.480> the<00:00:06.660> ashes

00:00:06.909 --> 00:00:06.919 
proof-of-concept risen from the ashes

00:00:06.919 --> 00:00:09.770 
proof-of-concept risen from the ashes
it's<00:00:07.919> May<00:00:08.160> 2012<00:00:08.849> and<00:00:09.179> I<00:00:09.240> think<00:00:09.450> it's<00:00:09.570> been

00:00:09.770 --> 00:00:09.780 
it's May 2012 and I think it's been

00:00:09.780 --> 00:00:12.580 
it's May 2012 and I think it's been
sitting<00:00:10.769> sitting<00:00:11.099> in<00:00:11.280> my<00:00:11.400> closet<00:00:11.460> since

00:00:12.580 --> 00:00:12.590 
sitting sitting in my closet since

00:00:12.590 --> 00:00:17.960 
sitting sitting in my closet since
December<00:00:13.590> 2003<00:00:15.230> it<00:00:16.230> is<00:00:16.470> hooked<00:00:16.650> up<00:00:16.859> plugged<00:00:17.820> in

00:00:17.960 --> 00:00:17.970 
December 2003 it is hooked up plugged in

00:00:17.970 --> 00:00:23.620 
December 2003 it is hooked up plugged in
through<00:00:18.359> PCI<00:00:18.750> bus<00:00:19.939> to<00:00:20.939> a<00:00:21.320> PC<00:00:22.320> motherboard<00:00:22.710> and

00:00:23.620 --> 00:00:23.630 
through PCI bus to a PC motherboard and

00:00:23.630 --> 00:00:28.130 
through PCI bus to a PC motherboard and
then<00:00:24.630> I<00:00:24.689> have<00:00:25.460> this<00:00:26.460> debug<00:00:27.029> cable<00:00:27.869> here<00:00:28.019> which

00:00:28.130 --> 00:00:28.140 
then I have this debug cable here which

00:00:28.140 --> 00:00:30.349 
then I have this debug cable here which
is<00:00:28.260> the<00:00:28.349> serial<00:00:28.710> output<00:00:28.890> from<00:00:29.340> the<00:00:30.090> triple

00:00:30.349 --> 00:00:30.359 
is the serial output from the triple

00:00:30.359 --> 00:00:36.139 
is the serial output from the triple
device<00:00:30.599> going<00:00:31.230> over<00:00:31.710> a<00:00:32.090> cable<00:00:33.469> to<00:00:34.969> my<00:00:35.969> machine

00:00:36.139 --> 00:00:36.149 
device going over a cable to my machine

00:00:36.149 --> 00:00:37.910 
device going over a cable to my machine
that's<00:00:36.719> gonna<00:00:36.809> be<00:00:36.989> the<00:00:37.079> debug<00:00:37.350> output<00:00:37.500> that

00:00:37.910 --> 00:00:37.920 
that's gonna be the debug output that

00:00:37.920 --> 00:00:40.850 
that's gonna be the debug output that
currently<00:00:38.250> is<00:00:38.460> dumping<00:00:39.239> memory<00:00:39.860> contents

00:00:40.850 --> 00:00:40.860 
currently is dumping memory contents

00:00:40.860 --> 00:00:43.490 
currently is dumping memory contents
then<00:00:41.790> there's<00:00:42.000> a<00:00:42.059> jtag<00:00:42.480> connector<00:00:42.510> connected

00:00:43.490 --> 00:00:43.500 
then there's a jtag connector connected

00:00:43.500 --> 00:00:47.779 
then there's a jtag connector connected
to<00:00:43.680> the<00:00:43.860> SPI<00:00:44.850> 610<00:00:45.680> that<00:00:46.680> is<00:00:46.770> also<00:00:46.950> serial<00:00:47.550> port

00:00:47.779 --> 00:00:47.789 
to the SPI 610 that is also serial port

00:00:47.789 --> 00:00:50.770 
to the SPI 610 that is also serial port
you<00:00:48.690> tell<00:00:48.899> the<00:00:48.989> age<00:00:49.110> of<00:00:49.289> these<00:00:49.440> devices<00:00:49.950> now

00:00:50.770 --> 00:00:50.780 
you tell the age of these devices now

00:00:50.780 --> 00:00:54.830 
you tell the age of these devices now
connected<00:00:51.780> again<00:00:52.350> to<00:00:52.739> my<00:00:52.829> machine<00:00:53.600> so<00:00:54.600> we're

00:00:54.830 --> 00:00:54.840 
connected again to my machine so we're

00:00:54.840 --> 00:00:57.319 
connected again to my machine so we're
compiling<00:00:55.140> code<00:00:55.850> loading<00:00:56.850> it<00:00:56.940> through<00:00:57.180> the

00:00:57.319 --> 00:00:57.329 
compiling code loading it through the

00:00:57.329 --> 00:01:01.849 
compiling code loading it through the
JTAG<00:00:57.660> interface<00:00:59.660> running<00:01:00.660> on<00:01:00.809> the<00:01:01.590> triple

00:01:01.849 --> 00:01:01.859 
JTAG interface running on the triple

00:01:01.859 --> 00:01:04.789 
JTAG interface running on the triple
device<00:01:02.100> and<00:01:02.370> then<00:01:03.260> serially<00:01:04.260> transmitting

00:01:04.789 --> 00:01:04.799 
device and then serially transmitting

00:01:04.799 --> 00:01:07.550 
device and then serially transmitting
data<00:01:04.949> back<00:01:05.280> so<00:01:06.119> the<00:01:06.390> this<00:01:06.720> board<00:01:07.020> actually<00:01:07.200> has

00:01:07.550 --> 00:01:07.560 
data back so the this board actually has

00:01:07.560 --> 00:01:10.130 
data back so the this board actually has
a<00:01:07.610> program<00:01:08.610> called<00:01:08.640> mod<00:01:09.060> 960<00:01:09.689> on<00:01:09.840> it<00:01:09.990> which<00:01:10.110> is

00:01:10.130 --> 00:01:10.140 
a program called mod 960 on it which is

00:01:10.140 --> 00:01:14.390 
a program called mod 960 on it which is
the<00:01:10.460> I<00:01:11.460> 960<00:01:12.360> monitor<00:01:12.810> that<00:01:13.680> communicates<00:01:14.220> with

00:01:14.390 --> 00:01:14.400 
the I 960 monitor that communicates with

00:01:14.400 --> 00:01:16.310 
the I 960 monitor that communicates with
the<00:01:14.580> jtag<00:01:14.970> port

00:01:16.310 --> 00:01:16.320 
the jtag port

00:01:16.320 --> 00:01:18.469 
the jtag port
so<00:01:16.830> we're<00:01:17.070> basically<00:01:17.189> loading<00:01:17.729> code<00:01:18.030> on<00:01:18.270> and

00:01:18.469 --> 00:01:18.479 
so we're basically loading code on and

00:01:18.479 --> 00:01:21.950 
so we're basically loading code on and
executing<00:01:18.960> it<00:01:19.049> from<00:01:19.380> Ram<00:01:19.619> in<00:01:20.610> the<00:01:20.729> mod<00:01:21.270> 960

00:01:21.950 --> 00:01:21.960 
executing it from Ram in the mod 960

00:01:21.960 --> 00:01:24.469 
executing it from Ram in the mod 960
stays<00:01:22.700> internal<00:01:23.700> resident<00:01:24.119> to<00:01:24.210> that<00:01:24.330> machine

00:01:24.469 --> 00:01:24.479 
stays internal resident to that machine

00:01:24.479 --> 00:01:28.190 
stays internal resident to that machine
so<00:01:24.890> let's<00:01:25.890> see<00:01:26.009> let's<00:01:26.189> go<00:01:26.250> ahead<00:01:26.430> and<00:01:27.200> there's

00:01:28.190 --> 00:01:28.200 
so let's see let's go ahead and there's

00:01:28.200 --> 00:01:35.620 
so let's see let's go ahead and there's
some<00:01:28.320> code<00:01:28.560> compiled<00:01:31.220> if<00:01:32.220> we<00:01:32.430> can<00:01:32.579> autofocus

00:01:35.620 --> 00:01:35.630 

00:01:35.630 --> 00:01:39.109 

this<00:01:36.630> stuff<00:01:36.930> and<00:01:37.460> yeah<00:01:38.460> this<00:01:38.640> is<00:01:38.759> some<00:01:38.909> code

00:01:39.109 --> 00:01:39.119 
this stuff and yeah this is some code

00:01:39.119 --> 00:01:44.899 
this stuff and yeah this is some code
from<00:01:39.650> December<00:01:40.650> 10<00:01:40.829> 2003<00:01:41.540> of<00:01:43.909> basically

00:01:44.899 --> 00:01:44.909 
from December 10 2003 of basically

00:01:44.909 --> 00:01:51.100 
from December 10 2003 of basically
querying<00:01:45.390> the<00:01:45.479> PCI<00:01:45.960> bus<00:01:47.329> and<00:01:48.329> then<00:01:49.820> dumping

00:01:51.100 --> 00:01:51.110 
querying the PCI bus and then dumping

00:01:51.110 --> 00:01:55.520 
querying the PCI bus and then dumping
grabbing<00:01:52.110> memory<00:01:52.710> via<00:01:53.610> DMA<00:01:54.450> from<00:01:55.020> address<00:01:55.229> 0

00:01:55.520 --> 00:01:55.530 
grabbing memory via DMA from address 0

00:01:55.530 --> 00:01:59.209 
grabbing memory via DMA from address 0
and<00:01:55.829> then<00:01:56.340> we're<00:01:56.549> grabbing<00:01:57.259> chunks<00:01:58.259> of<00:01:58.469> 10,000

00:01:59.209 --> 00:01:59.219 
and then we're grabbing chunks of 10,000

00:01:59.219 --> 00:02:00.620 
and then we're grabbing chunks of 10,000
hex<00:01:59.369> bytes<00:01:59.610> at<00:01:59.729> a<00:01:59.759> time<00:01:59.790> which<00:02:00.090> is<00:02:00.119> 64

00:02:00.620 --> 00:02:00.630 
hex bytes at a time which is 64

00:02:00.630 --> 00:02:03.080 
hex bytes at a time which is 64
kilobytes<00:02:01.020> and<00:02:01.259> we're<00:02:02.159> basically<00:02:02.310> going<00:02:02.579> up

00:02:03.080 --> 00:02:03.090 
kilobytes and we're basically going up

00:02:03.090 --> 00:02:06.830 
kilobytes and we're basically going up
to<00:02:03.240> 128<00:02:04.229> kilobytes<00:02:05.390> and<00:02:06.390> it's<00:02:06.570> just<00:02:06.689> gonna

00:02:06.830 --> 00:02:06.840 
to 128 kilobytes and it's just gonna

00:02:06.840 --> 00:02:08.960 
to 128 kilobytes and it's just gonna
grab<00:02:07.409> it<00:02:07.619> dump<00:02:08.009> it<00:02:08.160> to<00:02:08.190> the<00:02:08.369> screen<00:02:08.610> and<00:02:08.819> that's

00:02:08.960 --> 00:02:08.970 
grab it dump it to the screen and that's

00:02:08.970 --> 00:02:09.460 
grab it dump it to the screen and that's
it

00:02:09.460 --> 00:02:09.470 
it

00:02:09.470 --> 00:02:15.550 
it
so<00:02:10.470> let's<00:02:10.739> give<00:02:10.890> it<00:02:10.920> a<00:02:11.009> try

00:02:15.550 --> 00:02:15.560 

00:02:15.560 --> 00:02:23.990 

run<00:02:16.610> and<00:02:17.610> then<00:02:17.930> go<00:02:18.930> to<00:02:18.990> our<00:02:20.930> debug<00:02:21.930> console<00:02:23.000> and

00:02:23.990 --> 00:02:24.000 
run and then go to our debug console and

00:02:24.000 --> 00:02:27.260 
run and then go to our debug console and
you<00:02:24.150> can<00:02:24.270> see<00:02:24.510> now<00:02:24.690> were<00:02:25.850> magically<00:02:26.850> dumping

00:02:27.260 --> 00:02:27.270 
you can see now were magically dumping

00:02:27.270 --> 00:02:31.000 
you can see now were magically dumping
the<00:02:28.140> volatile<00:02:28.500> contents<00:02:29.040> of<00:02:29.190> that<00:02:29.640> machine<00:02:30.120> at

00:02:31.000 --> 00:02:31.010 
the volatile contents of that machine at

00:02:31.010 --> 00:02:35.150 
the volatile contents of that machine at
a<00:02:32.010> glorious<00:02:32.610> 115<00:02:33.510> point<00:02:33.870> 2<00:02:34.200> kilobits<00:02:35.040> per

00:02:35.150 --> 00:02:35.160 
a glorious 115 point 2 kilobits per

00:02:35.160 --> 00:02:37.220 
a glorious 115 point 2 kilobits per
second<00:02:35.670> and<00:02:36.660> that<00:02:36.690> machine<00:02:37.020> right<00:02:37.200> now

00:02:37.220 --> 00:02:37.230 
second and that machine right now

00:02:37.230 --> 00:02:42.590 
second and that machine right now
actually<00:02:37.530> has<00:02:37.860> a<00:02:37.890> boon<00:02:38.640> to<00:02:39.560> running<00:02:40.560> on<00:02:40.710> it<00:02:41.600> so

00:02:42.590 --> 00:02:42.600 
actually has a boon to running on it so

00:02:42.600 --> 00:02:46.010 
actually has a boon to running on it so
it's<00:02:42.720> gonna<00:02:42.840> dumb<00:02:43.050> 128<00:02:43.680> kilobytes<00:02:44.010> and<00:02:45.020> then

00:02:46.010 --> 00:02:46.020 
it's gonna dumb 128 kilobytes and then

00:02:46.020 --> 00:03:08.000 
it's gonna dumb 128 kilobytes and then
stop

00:03:08.000 --> 00:03:08.010 

00:03:08.010 --> 00:03:10.160 

and<00:03:08.430> there<00:03:08.700> you<00:03:08.790> have<00:03:08.819> it<00:03:09.239> triple<00:03:09.720> triple

00:03:10.160 --> 00:03:10.170 
and there you have it triple triple

00:03:10.170 --> 00:03:15.409 
and there you have it triple triple
revived<00:03:12.140> D<00:03:13.140> end
