00:00:25.410 --> 00:00:31.950
 every Friday the suite of the week 

00:00:28.529 --> 00:00:35.190
 guys let's see these and in the last 

00:00:31.950 --> 00:00:38.790
 snapshot is worth and that means that three 

00:00:35.190 --> 00:00:40.410
 things from the 1.6 I just hope not 

00:00:38.790 --> 00:00:43.050
 changed the generation of the trunks a lot 

00:00:40.410 --> 00:00:45.600
 as they have done so far and continues 

00:00:43.050 --> 00:00:50.520
 being as it is at the exit of the 1.6 

00:00:45.600 --> 00:00:53.460
 but if it's the other way around, it's true 

00:00:50.520 --> 00:00:55.060
 also to 1.6 because you know that only 

00:00:53.460 --> 00:01:00.640
 it will work 

00:00:55.060 --> 00:01:02.440
 at 10 and 13 w 18 to 20 

00:01:00.640 --> 00:01:04.239
 but good bad it will be guys if I'm 

00:01:02.440 --> 00:01:05.920
 ready to go to moore world options 

00:01:04.239 --> 00:01:12.640

00:01:05.920 --> 00:01:15.490
 natural and home of the rich and the emt 

00:01:12.640 --> 00:01:19.000
 this week is flat 

00:01:15.490 --> 00:01:22.600
 efe l a t so simple we give 

00:01:19.000 --> 00:01:25.120
 they tied and we created a new world 

00:01:22.600 --> 00:01:27.070
 you guys should know a little bit and it's 

00:01:25.120 --> 00:01:29.890
 I understand that the space of 

00:01:27.070 --> 00:01:32.800
 cavaliers en acklins is one per 

00:01:29.890 --> 00:01:35.170
 cent is worth it is very rare 

00:01:32.800 --> 00:01:37.630
 that is formed in horses in language of the 

00:01:35.170 --> 00:01:40.150
 meadow and I'm going to put a second and I 

00:01:37.630 --> 00:01:48.130
 sick we hope that endurance 

00:01:40.150 --> 00:01:50.920
 enough 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 is I do not know if they have 

00:01:48.130 --> 00:01:53.800
 counted I think so 7 is for some of 

00:01:50.920 --> 00:01:55.570
 horses tale 8 for that from there yes those 

00:01:53.800 --> 00:01:57.640
 they are also horses 

00:01:55.570 --> 00:02:00.250
 right now found 8 other times I have 

00:01:57.640 --> 00:02:01.540
 come to count 9 and 10 is worth because I think 

00:02:00.250 --> 00:02:06.070
 that if I keep going there 

00:02:01.540 --> 00:02:08.110

00:02:06.070 --> 00:02:11.020

00:02:32.620 --> 00:02:36.850
 we get a friend horse worth it because 

00:02:35.140 --> 00:02:41.050
 what you should do is that if you go to 

00:02:36.850 --> 00:02:43.540
 play this is so well it will quickly go 

00:02:41.050 --> 00:02:45.970
 to take the maximum possible horses and 

00:02:43.540 --> 00:02:48.040
 or long and baixa for another country to 

00:02:45.970 --> 00:02:51.250
 another one quickly they take you try 

00:02:48.040 --> 00:02:54.070
 well try to go up and give him affection 

00:02:51.250 --> 00:02:56.200
 and you're going for another one, that's worth a lot 

00:02:54.070 --> 00:02:58.480

00:02:56.200 --> 00:03:00.160

00:03:04.390 --> 00:03:08.620

00:03:50.440 --> 00:03:55.330
 very similar to this one we do not go around here and 

00:03:53.799 --> 00:03:57.299
 is let's see if we put torch before 

00:03:55.330 --> 00:04:00.370
 that nothing is being explained 

00:03:57.299 --> 00:04:04.910

00:04:00.370 --> 00:04:08.060

00:04:08.060 --> 00:04:16.150
 well the world is worth the acc it is worth as you see 

00:04:12.230 --> 00:04:19.580
 it's a pretty bestial injury because 

00:04:16.150 --> 00:04:22.280
 well, it's very very decayed and here 

00:04:19.580 --> 00:04:24.770
 we have a floating bowl where we have 2 

00:04:22.280 --> 00:04:27.800
 sanders ok we can take the horses 

00:04:24.770 --> 00:04:31.070
 and here we have two assemblers of 

00:04:27.800 --> 00:04:33.590
 horses are worth then both are from 

00:04:31.070 --> 00:04:36.230
 metal we will see two salts and with this 

00:04:33.590 --> 00:04:39.860
 we could have a horse that does not 

00:04:36.230 --> 00:04:42.050
 we can take a trip and if for some 

00:04:39.860 --> 00:04:45.500
 casual law that on radio over and it kills you 

00:04:42.050 --> 00:04:47.570
 we would have another second set of 

00:04:45.500 --> 00:04:51.230
 horse to be able to have a second 

00:04:47.570 --> 00:04:53.780
