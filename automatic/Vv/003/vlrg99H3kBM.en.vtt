00:00:00.947 --> 00:00:02.463
We are going to crab pot!

00:00:07.079 --> 00:00:10.486
This is our first joint outing in America this year.

00:00:13.320 --> 00:00:14.030
This is our hotel.

00:00:18.443 --> 00:00:22.631
To my mind there are 40 floors, we live on 10-11 floors.

00:00:23.552 --> 00:00:24.878
It's just a short fact.

00:00:25.807 --> 00:00:31.281
I will record more, I will record everything, or at least I will try to do so.

00:00:32.568 --> 00:00:34.799
So you can expect a lot of interesting stuff.

00:00:56.863 --> 00:00:57.478
It's kind of a market.

00:00:57.889 --> 00:00:59.228
Look, they sell crabs here.

00:01:02.067 --> 00:01:04.481
I must run. I shouldn't fall behind the guys.

00:01:04.846 --> 00:01:05.555
I don't even know...

00:01:05.643 --> 00:01:10.459
We walk along some wharf, I don't know exactly where are we.

00:01:10.882 --> 00:01:15.282
So, in those stores, I don't even know what's there.

00:01:15.282 --> 00:01:15.789
Some fish...

00:01:15.789 --> 00:01:17.499
Aha! It's Farmer's Market.

00:01:18.144 --> 00:01:19.424
Behind those market is the bay.

00:01:20.994 --> 00:01:22.850
I think we will get there and I will show it to you.

00:01:26.821 --> 00:01:28.756
Also America is full of smells.

00:01:30.295 --> 00:01:32.374
While we were walking down that street,

00:01:32.374 --> 00:01:36.759
I've heard tens of smells from every restaurant, from every store.

00:01:37.667 --> 00:01:44.829
This is probably a distinctive feature of America compared to Russia, Ukraine.

00:01:47.167 --> 00:01:48.469
It's full of smells.

00:02:10.640 --> 00:02:11.816
Here we are!

00:02:14.642 --> 00:02:16.017
We will bump off crabs now!

00:02:17.431 --> 00:02:21.307
I mean you! Noobs who play Dota!

00:02:22.541 --> 00:02:23.250
Hammer them!

00:02:26.032 --> 00:02:29.269
While we are waiting in the queue we decided to visit souvenir shop.

00:02:34.370 --> 00:02:36.653
Bibs, aprons...

00:02:43.143 --> 00:02:44.414
All of it is pirate-themed.

00:02:55.552 --> 00:02:56.759
Turn away for a moment.

00:03:02.228 --> 00:03:03.947
You can take pirate hat and walk in it.

00:03:10.163 --> 00:03:11.101
You have to step back...

00:03:18.210 --> 00:03:19.016
Where should I put it?

00:03:19.016 --> 00:03:19.805
There.

00:03:25.429 --> 00:03:25.936
It's a compass.

00:03:27.104 --> 00:03:27.639
Puzzles.

00:03:37.087 --> 00:03:39.526
Okay we should probably leave now.

00:03:42.399 --> 00:03:43.225
Now then! What's that?

00:03:45.479 --> 00:03:48.006
A finger mustache, how cute!

00:03:54.756 --> 00:03:56.137
In short that's the best thing around.

00:03:58.273 --> 00:03:59.081
Come on, come on.

00:04:04.597 --> 00:04:05.500
It wasn't one shot...

00:04:05.500 --> 00:04:06.017
Of course!

00:04:20.382 --> 00:04:24.237
There were no signs of a trouble but Glebka is dissatisfied.

00:04:25.267 --> 00:04:26.775
Xboct rubbed his nose.

00:04:28.116 --> 00:04:31.553
He wants to express his view on this.

00:04:33.193 --> 00:04:33.557
Ready...

00:04:35.040 --> 00:04:35.820
A hit!

00:04:54.570 --> 00:04:57.175
After a long wait we finally sit here.

00:04:58.094 --> 00:04:59.414
Let's see what is in the menu.

00:05:02.980 --> 00:05:03.651
Here we go.

00:05:10.883 --> 00:05:15.544
Salads, burgers, seafood, beer.

00:05:19.702 --> 00:05:21.917
A pint... how much is a pint?

00:05:22.396 --> 00:05:23.697
5.25, what's that?

00:05:35.601 --> 00:05:39.852
So it's 1.5L for 18$.

00:05:58.625 --> 00:05:59.227
Okay, I've got it.

00:05:59.646 --> 00:06:00.912
So it was wrong.

00:06:01.651 --> 00:06:05.753
We pay 5.25 for 0.5L, 9.50 for 1L.

00:06:09.117 --> 00:06:09.894
Let's move on.
