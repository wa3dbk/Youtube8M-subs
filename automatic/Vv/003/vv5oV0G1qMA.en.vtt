00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.680
 it is positioned distally now without 

00:00:02.850 --> 00:00:07.080
 affect the periodontal attack 

00:00:04.680 --> 00:00:09.030
 of the dental element the lines of 

00:00:07.080 --> 00:00:11.400
 incisions can extend creating a 

00:00:09.030 --> 00:00:13.290
 cross at the point of convergence 

00:00:11.400 --> 00:00:15.719
 this greatly facilitates the phases 

00:00:13.290 --> 00:00:17.190
 initiation of the detachment since the 

00:00:15.719 --> 00:00:19.470
 vascularization of the maxilla 

00:00:17.190 --> 00:00:22.140
 superior to an epic trend 

00:00:19.470 --> 00:00:24.500
 coronal the vertical incision of 

00:00:22.140 --> 00:00:27.210
 release must be parallel to it 

00:00:24.500 --> 00:00:29.189
 the flap must be wider than the 

00:00:27.210 --> 00:00:32.250
 projection of the maxillary sinus on the 

00:00:29.189 --> 00:00:33.930
 evaluation vestibular wall 

00:00:32.250 --> 00:00:36.570
 of the angle formed by the walls of the 

00:00:33.930 --> 00:00:38.610
 maxillary sinus conditions the position 

00:00:36.570 --> 00:00:41.700
 of the other ostomy and therefore of the flap of 

00:00:38.610 --> 00:00:44.040
 access this detail is a lot 

00:00:41.700 --> 00:00:46.110
 important since it can affect the 

00:00:44.040 --> 00:00:48.030
 success of the intervention as 

00:00:46.110 --> 00:00:49.770
 it has been shown that if I do jaw 

00:00:48.030 --> 00:00:52.110
 very narrow comparisons 

00:00:49.770 --> 00:00:54.329
 especially in the front recess they have 

00:00:52.110 --> 00:00:57.840
 a higher index of perforation than 

00:00:54.329 --> 00:00:59.850
 sinus membrane follows that when 

00:00:57.840 --> 00:01:02.370
 the clinician notes an anatomy on the atac 

00:00:59.850 --> 00:01:04.979
 unfavorable with very vertical walls and 

00:01:02.370 --> 00:01:06.659
 therefore a narrow breast is appropriate 

00:01:04.979 --> 00:01:08.909
 perform another more mesial stoma 

00:01:06.659 --> 00:01:11.130
 possible and consequently engraving 

00:01:08.909 --> 00:01:13.110
 vertical release will have to be 

00:01:11.130 --> 00:01:15.470
 performed far from the edges of the other 

00:01:13.110 --> 00:01:15.470
 stoma 

00:01:19.360 --> 00:01:23.440
 in addition the incision line will have to 

00:01:21.670 --> 00:01:26.020
 anticipate any maneuvers of 

00:01:23.440 --> 00:01:27.640
 vestibular regeneration and in the case of 

00:01:26.020 --> 00:01:29.680
 sampling of the tuber area 

00:01:27.640 --> 00:01:31.690
 the incision can be extended to 

00:01:29.680 --> 00:01:34.800
 distal direction without having to set up 

00:01:31.690 --> 00:01:34.800
 a second I read 

00:01:38.990 --> 00:01:43.740
 the detachment always occurs in a manner 

00:01:41.460 --> 00:01:45.480
 delicate with rotating movements 

00:01:43.740 --> 00:01:48.120
 of the spillway and through a 

00:01:45.480 --> 00:01:49.740
 bimanual control a technique b 

00:01:48.120 --> 00:01:52.700
 manual allows more control 

00:01:49.740 --> 00:01:52.700
 during detachment 

00:02:02.920 --> 00:02:07.549
 any connective adhesions must 

00:02:05.540 --> 00:02:10.130
 be engraved with a scalpel or not 

00:02:07.549 --> 00:02:13.330
 lacerate with the spill the 

00:02:10.130 --> 00:02:13.330
 tearing of the period
