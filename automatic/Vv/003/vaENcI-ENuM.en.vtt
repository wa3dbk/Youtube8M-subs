to do is sweep the teabags and half a

00:00:36.570 --> 00:00:38.450 
to do is sweep the teabags and half a
cup<00:00:36.600> of<00:00:36.960> boiling<00:00:37.170> water<00:00:37.380> and<00:00:37.829> a<00:00:37.920> measuring<00:00:38.250> cup

for<00:00:38.670> 15<00:00:39.270> minutes<00:00:39.629> and<00:00:39.809> so<00:00:40.500> the<00:00:40.620> key<00:00:40.770> is<00:00:40.800> to<00:00:41.010> make

00:00:41.119 --> 00:00:41.129 
for 15 minutes and so the key is to make

00:00:41.129 --> 00:00:43.340 
for 15 minutes and so the key is to make
it<00:00:41.250> taste<00:00:41.489> as<00:00:41.700> strong<00:00:42.059> as<00:00:42.270> possible<00:00:42.450> because

00:00:44.720 --> 00:00:44.730 
it's going to be diluted when you mix it

00:00:44.730 --> 00:00:46.459 
it's going to be diluted when you mix it
with<00:00:44.820> the<00:00:44.910> other<00:00:45.000> ingredients<00:00:45.660> so<00:00:46.050> that's<00:00:46.260> why

00:00:46.459 --> 00:00:46.469 
with the other ingredients so that's why

00:00:46.469 --> 00:00:51.380 
with the other ingredients so that's why
we're<00:00:46.649> using<00:00:46.739> about<00:00:47.010> 5<00:00:47.370> to<00:00:47.550> 6<00:00:47.730> teabags<00:00:50.210> so<00:00:51.210> once
