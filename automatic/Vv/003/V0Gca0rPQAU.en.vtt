base coat now we will have three basic
steps<00:01:13.049> you<00:01:14.060> first<00:01:15.060> have<00:01:15.600> to<00:01:16.340> apply<00:01:17.340> a<00:01:17.580> base

00:01:17.840 --> 00:01:17.850 
steps you first have to apply a base

00:01:17.850 --> 00:01:21.740 
steps you first have to apply a base
coat<00:01:17.880> after<00:01:18.570> that<00:01:19.560> you<00:01:20.159> put<00:01:20.670> the<00:01:21.060> nail<00:01:21.299> in<00:01:21.330> the

00:01:21.740 --> 00:01:21.750 
coat after that you put the nail in the

00:01:21.750 --> 00:01:25.789 
coat after that you put the nail in the
glitters<00:01:22.380> like<00:01:23.040> this<00:01:23.369> and<00:01:24.439> press<00:01:25.439> a<00:01:25.680> little

00:01:25.789 --> 00:01:25.799 
glitters like this and press a little

00:01:25.799 --> 00:01:28.789 
glitters like this and press a little
bit<00:01:26.040> because<00:01:26.270> you<00:01:27.270> want<00:01:27.540> the<00:01:27.930> details<00:01:28.350> cause

00:01:32.120 --> 00:01:32.130 
everywhere and after that of course you

00:01:32.130 --> 00:01:34.940 
everywhere and after that of course you
have<00:01:32.310> to<00:01:32.640> tap<00:01:33.420> a<00:01:33.600> little<00:01:33.930> bit<00:01:34.049> to<00:01:34.320> remove<00:01:34.770> the

00:01:34.940 --> 00:01:34.950

excess

00:01:37.910 --> 00:01:37.920 

00:01:37.920 --> 00:01:41.100

excess<00:01:41.590> between<00:01:42.250> the<00:01:42.520> critical<00:01:42.970> line<00:01:43.180> and<00:01:43.510> the

00:01:43.950 --> 00:01:43.960 
excess between the critical line and the

00:01:43.960 --> 00:01:46.710 
excess between the critical line and the
rest<00:01:44.620> of<00:01:44.830> the<00:01:44.980> skin<00:01:45.220> and<00:01:45.730> you<00:01:45.910> can<00:01:45.940> also<00:01:46.360> use<00:01:46.690> a

00:01:46.710 --> 00:01:46.720 
rest of the skin and you can also use a

00:01:46.720 --> 00:01:48.810 
rest of the skin and you can also use a
brush<00:01:47.080> to<00:01:47.140> remove<00:01:47.500> all<00:01:47.920> the<00:01:48.130> excess<00:01:48.340> of

00:01:48.810 --> 00:01:48.820 
brush to remove all the excess of

00:01:48.820 --> 00:01:52.520 
brush to remove all the excess of
glitters<00:01:49.330> on<00:01:49.720> to<00:01:49.960> the<00:01:50.080> skin

00:01:52.520 --> 00:01:52.530 

00:01:52.530 --> 00:01:56.010 

once<00:01:53.530> you<00:01:53.770> finish<00:01:54.280> to<00:01:54.490> remove<00:01:54.850> the<00:01:55.390> majority

00:01:56.010 --> 00:01:56.020 
once you finish to remove the majority

00:01:56.020 --> 00:01:59.790 
once you finish to remove the majority
of<00:01:56.290> the<00:01:56.830> leaders<00:01:57.190> you<00:01:57.550> can<00:01:58.270> apply<00:01:58.930> up<00:01:59.200> topcoat

00:01:59.790 --> 00:01:59.800 
of the leaders you can apply up topcoat

00:01:59.800 --> 00:02:02.520 
of the leaders you can apply up topcoat
and<00:02:00.040> I<00:02:00.280> like<00:02:00.460> to<00:02:00.640> use<00:02:00.820> two<00:02:01.180> layers<00:02:01.570> because<00:02:02.140> it

00:02:02.520 --> 00:02:02.530 
and I like to use two layers because it

00:02:02.530 --> 00:02:05.100 
and I like to use two layers because it
will<00:02:02.800> protect<00:02:03.100> the<00:02:03.400> nails<00:02:03.730> and<00:02:04.030> the<00:02:04.110> manicure

00:02:05.100 --> 00:02:05.110 
will protect the nails and the manicure

00:02:05.110 --> 00:02:06.740 
will protect the nails and the manicure
will<00:02:05.410> last<00:02:05.650> longer

00:02:06.740 --> 00:02:06.750 
will last longer

00:02:06.750 --> 00:02:09.810 
will last longer
now<00:02:07.750> it's<00:02:08.140> simple<00:02:08.560> you<00:02:08.860> have<00:02:09.040> to<00:02:09.250> repeat<00:02:09.640> those

00:02:09.810 --> 00:02:09.820 
now it's simple you have to repeat those

00:02:09.820 --> 00:02:13.410 
now it's simple you have to repeat those
three<00:02:10.090> steps<00:02:10.360> so<00:02:11.080> this<00:02:11.890> is<00:02:12.130> the<00:02:12.280> base<00:02:12.490> coat<00:02:12.850> the

00:02:13.410 --> 00:02:13.420 
three steps so this is the base coat the

00:02:13.420 --> 00:02:17.720 
three steps so this is the base coat the
glitters<00:02:13.990> and<00:02:14.370> the<00:02:15.370> top<00:02:15.610> coat<00:02:15.820> and<00:02:16.030> that's<00:02:16.510> it

00:02:17.720 --> 00:02:17.730 
glitters and the top coat and that's it

00:02:17.730 --> 00:02:20.699 
glitters and the top coat and that's it
it<00:02:18.730> looks<00:02:19.030> a<00:02:19.270> little<00:02:19.390> bit<00:02:19.630> messy<00:02:19.810> because<00:02:20.230> the

00:02:20.699 --> 00:02:20.709 
it looks a little bit messy because the

00:02:20.709 --> 00:02:23.790 
it looks a little bit messy because the
clitoris<00:02:21.190> goes<00:02:21.520> everywhere<00:02:22.180> but<00:02:22.990> don't<00:02:23.650> worry

00:02:23.790 --> 00:02:23.800 
clitoris goes everywhere but don't worry

00:02:23.800 --> 00:02:27.540 
clitoris goes everywhere but don't worry
because<00:02:24.220> you<00:02:25.090> will<00:02:25.300> swipe<00:02:25.690> everything<00:02:26.590> when

00:02:27.540 --> 00:02:27.550 
because you will swipe everything when

00:02:27.550 --> 00:02:30.930 
because you will swipe everything when
everything<00:02:28.120> will<00:02:28.300> be<00:02:28.540> completely<00:02:29.200> dry<00:02:29.700> as<00:02:30.700> I

00:02:30.930 --> 00:02:30.940 
everything will be completely dry as I

00:02:30.940 --> 00:02:33.720

glitters<00:02:47.980> and<00:02:48.340> I<00:02:48.430> think<00:02:48.670> this<00:02:48.880> is<00:02:49.060> really

00:02:49.350 --> 00:02:49.360 
glitters and I think this is really

00:02:49.360 --> 00:02:52.050 
glitters and I think this is really
really<00:02:49.780> gorgeous<00:02:50.140> but<00:02:50.590> for<00:02:51.310> new<00:02:51.430> your<00:02:51.610> theme<00:02:51.850> I

00:02:52.050 --> 00:02:52.060 
really gorgeous but for new your theme I

00:02:52.060 --> 00:02:54.770 
really gorgeous but for new your theme I
think<00:02:52.300> this<00:02:53.170> color<00:02:53.440> is<00:02:53.530> more<00:02:53.950> appropriate

00:02:54.770 --> 00:02:54.780 
think this color is more appropriate

00:02:54.780 --> 00:02:59.370 
think this color is more appropriate
because<00:02:55.950> it<00:02:56.950> goes<00:02:57.220> with<00:02:57.580> everything<00:02:58.090> and<00:02:58.600> I<00:02:59.050> be

00:02:59.370 --> 00:02:59.380 
because it goes with everything and I be

00:02:59.380 --> 00:03:02.880 
because it goes with everything and I be
probably<00:03:00.010> wearing<00:03:00.310> black<00:03:01.030> dress<00:03:01.330> so<00:03:01.900> yes<00:03:02.560> this

00:03:02.880 --> 00:03:02.890 
probably wearing black dress so yes this

00:03:02.890 --> 00:03:08.930 
probably wearing black dress so yes this
will<00:03:03.100> be<00:03:03.160> a<00:03:03.340> good<00:03:03.760> match<00:03:03.970> for<00:03:04.300> me
