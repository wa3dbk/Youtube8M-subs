00:02:28.300 --> 00:02:28.310 
then it will lock on a frequency when it

00:02:28.310 --> 00:02:30.610 
then it will lock on a frequency when it
does<00:02:28.489> just<00:02:28.790> hold<00:02:29.630> the<00:02:29.750> mode<00:02:29.930> set<00:02:30.170> button<00:02:30.410> in

the battery and AF lights will come back

00:02:32.870 --> 00:02:34.900 
the battery and AF lights will come back
on<00:02:33.140> and<00:02:33.470> you're<00:02:33.890> locked<00:02:34.070> in<00:02:34.310> on<00:02:34.459> a<00:02:34.489> frequency

00:02:34.900 --> 00:02:34.910 
on and you're locked in on a frequency

00:02:34.910 --> 00:02:36.729 
on and you're locked in on a frequency
in<00:02:35.090> this<00:02:35.269> case<00:02:35.510> we're<00:02:35.750> at<00:02:35.810> five<00:02:36.050> forty<00:02:36.440> five

00:02:36.729 --> 00:02:36.739 
in this case we're at five forty five

00:02:36.739 --> 00:02:41.220 
in this case we're at five forty five
point<00:02:37.370> five<00:02:37.610> megahertz<00:02:38.860> now<00:02:39.860> to<00:02:39.920> match<00:02:40.310> that

00:02:41.220 --> 00:02:41.230 
point five megahertz now to match that

00:02:41.230 --> 00:02:43.150 
point five megahertz now to match that
obviously<00:02:42.230> it's<00:02:42.440> not<00:02:42.590> gonna<00:02:42.680> work<00:02:42.890> very<00:02:43.040> well

00:02:43.150 --> 00:02:43.160 
obviously it's not gonna work very well

00:02:43.160 --> 00:02:44.800 
obviously it's not gonna work very well
if<00:02:43.430> our<00:02:43.580> transmitter<00:02:44.090> and<00:02:44.239> receiver<00:02:44.480> aren't

00:02:44.800 --> 00:02:44.810 
if our transmitter and receiver aren't

00:02:44.810 --> 00:02:46.900 
if our transmitter and receiver aren't
on<00:02:44.900> the<00:02:44.989> same<00:02:45.140> frequency<00:02:45.680> so<00:02:46.250> to<00:02:46.370> match<00:02:46.640> that

00:02:46.900 --> 00:02:46.910 
on the same frequency so to match that

00:02:46.910 --> 00:02:49.150 
on the same frequency so to match that
with<00:02:47.120> the<00:02:47.150> transmitter<00:02:47.989> we<00:02:48.530> push<00:02:48.769> the<00:02:48.950> set

00:02:49.150 --> 00:02:49.160 
with the transmitter we push the set

00:02:49.160 --> 00:02:51.880 
with the transmitter we push the set
button<00:02:49.430> and<00:02:49.989> the<00:02:50.989> Edit<00:02:51.260> light<00:02:51.440> will<00:02:51.620> come<00:02:51.739> on

button and the Edit light will come on

00:02:51.890 --> 00:02:54.190 
button and the Edit light will come on
and<00:02:52.220> there's<00:02:52.940> two<00:02:53.120> arrows<00:02:53.510> here<00:02:53.720> we<00:02:53.930> need<00:02:54.049> to

00:02:54.190 --> 00:02:54.200 
and there's two arrows here we need to

00:02:54.200 --> 00:02:59.470 
and there's two arrows here we need to
go<00:02:54.350> to<00:02:55.750> five<00:02:56.750> forty<00:02:57.110> five<00:02:57.140> hit<00:02:57.980> set<00:02:58.280> and<00:02:58.489> then

00:02:59.470 --> 00:02:59.480 
go to five forty five hit set and then

00:02:59.480 --> 00:03:00.759 
go to five forty five hit set and then
on<00:02:59.600> the<00:02:59.750> stand<00:03:00.140> that<00:03:00.170> will<00:03:00.350> light<00:03:00.470> up<00:03:00.620> the

second set of digits of three digits we

00:03:03.350 --> 00:03:05.320 
second set of digits of three digits we
need<00:03:03.380> to<00:03:03.590> go<00:03:03.680> to<00:03:03.769> five<00:03:03.980> hundred<00:03:04.220> so<00:03:05.060> we<00:03:05.090> will

00:03:05.320 --> 00:03:05.330 
need to go to five hundred so we will

00:03:05.330 --> 00:03:09.090 
need to go to five hundred so we will
just<00:03:05.540> push<00:03:06.700> multiple<00:03:07.700> times<00:03:07.940> until<00:03:08.480> we<00:03:08.540> get<00:03:08.870> to

five forty five point five and again hit
the<00:03:12.709> set<00:03:13.010> button<00:03:13.250> it'll<00:03:13.760> flash<00:03:14.060> stored<00:03:14.510> and

00:03:14.800 --> 00:03:14.810 
the set button it'll flash stored and

00:03:14.810 --> 00:03:16.480 
the set button it'll flash stored and
you're<00:03:15.200> all<00:03:15.320> set<00:03:15.560> to<00:03:15.620> go

00:03:16.480 --> 00:03:16.490 
you're all set to go

00:03:16.490 --> 00:03:18.010 
you're all set to go
now<00:03:16.670> let's<00:03:16.820> take<00:03:16.910> a<00:03:16.970> look<00:03:17.210> at<00:03:17.330> how<00:03:17.540> the<00:03:17.600> system

00:03:18.010 --> 00:03:18.020 
now let's take a look at how the system

00:03:18.020 --> 00:03:19.540 
now let's take a look at how the system
actually<00:03:18.140> performs<00:03:18.830> as<00:03:19.040> I<00:03:19.160> mentioned<00:03:19.460> we're

00:03:19.540 --> 00:03:19.550 
actually performs as I mentioned we're

00:03:19.550 --> 00:03:20.980 
actually performs as I mentioned we're
gonna<00:03:19.640> be<00:03:19.760> using<00:03:19.880> for<00:03:20.330> our<00:03:20.360> tests<00:03:20.660> today<00:03:20.810> of

00:03:34.190 --> 00:03:35.410 
you so let's just turn this on and the
first<00:03:34.400> thing<00:03:34.550> you<00:03:34.640> probably<00:03:34.760> noticed<00:03:35.270> there

00:03:35.410 --> 00:03:35.420 
first thing you probably noticed there

00:03:35.420 --> 00:03:37.450 
first thing you probably noticed there
was<00:03:35.510> no<00:03:35.540> pomp<00:03:35.960> or<00:03:36.230> click<00:03:36.530> or<00:03:36.680> anything<00:03:36.890> the

00:03:37.450 --> 00:03:37.460 
was no pomp or click or anything the

00:03:37.460 --> 00:03:40.930 
was no pomp or click or anything the
on/off<00:03:37.910> switch<00:03:37.940> is<00:03:38.510> quite<00:03:39.280> transparent<00:03:40.280> you

00:03:40.930 --> 00:03:40.940 
on/off switch is quite transparent you

00:03:40.940 --> 00:03:42.280 
on/off switch is quite transparent you
don't<00:03:41.090> hear<00:03:41.240> anything<00:03:41.510> through<00:03:41.870> the<00:03:41.960> system

00:03:42.280 --> 00:03:42.290 
don't hear anything through the system

00:03:42.290 --> 00:03:44.050 
don't hear anything through the system
which<00:03:42.410> is<00:03:42.440> very<00:03:42.620> very<00:03:43.040> nice<00:03:43.280> and<00:03:43.580> it's<00:03:43.880> very

00:03:44.050 --> 00:03:44.060 
which is very very nice and it's very

00:03:44.060 --> 00:03:46.180 
which is very very nice and it's very
very<00:03:44.210> well<00:03:44.450> placed<00:03:44.750> as<00:03:45.020> well<00:03:45.200> because<00:03:45.590> when

00:03:46.180 --> 00:03:46.190 
very well placed as well because when

00:03:46.190 --> 00:03:48.340 
very well placed as well because when
you're<00:03:46.340> using<00:03:46.730> this<00:03:47.060> especially<00:03:47.420> like<00:03:47.810> in<00:03:48.050> DJ

00:03:48.340 --> 00:03:48.350 
you're using this especially like in DJ

00:03:48.350 --> 00:03:49.570 
you're using this especially like in DJ
work<00:03:48.530> where<00:03:48.710> I<00:03:48.770> like<00:03:48.920> to<00:03:48.950> be<00:03:49.070> able<00:03:49.220> to<00:03:49.340> just

00:03:49.570 --> 00:03:49.580 
work where I like to be able to just

00:03:49.580 --> 00:03:50.980 
work where I like to be able to just
reach<00:03:49.730> down<00:03:49.760> real<00:03:50.210> quick<00:03:50.420> and<00:03:50.540> hit<00:03:50.690> the<00:03:50.840> thing

00:03:50.980 --> 00:03:50.990 
reach down real quick and hit the thing

00:03:50.990 --> 00:03:53.560 
reach down real quick and hit the thing
on<00:03:51.140> and<00:03:51.320> off<00:03:51.410> it's<00:03:51.950> instantaneous<00:03:52.640> it<00:03:53.300> comes

00:03:53.560 --> 00:03:53.570 
on and off it's instantaneous it comes

00:03:53.570 --> 00:03:55.000 
on and off it's instantaneous it comes
right<00:03:53.780> on<00:03:53.840> you<00:03:54.170> don't<00:03:54.290> have<00:03:54.440> to<00:03:54.560> wait<00:03:54.740> for<00:03:54.770> it

00:03:55.000 --> 00:03:55.010 
right on you don't have to wait for it

00:03:55.010 --> 00:03:58.000 
right on you don't have to wait for it
there's<00:03:55.280> no<00:03:55.460> latency<00:03:55.790> at<00:03:56.060> all<00:03:56.680> so<00:03:57.680> now<00:03:57.800> that<00:03:57.860> we

00:03:58.000 --> 00:03:58.010 
there's no latency at all so now that we

00:03:58.010 --> 00:04:00.070 
there's no latency at all so now that we
have<00:03:58.040> the<00:03:58.220> microphone<00:03:58.640> on<00:03:58.820> let's<00:03:59.060> see<00:03:59.870> what

00:04:00.070 --> 00:04:00.080 
have the microphone on let's see what

00:04:00.080 --> 00:04:02.860 
have the microphone on let's see what
kind<00:04:00.320> of<00:04:00.490> range<00:04:01.490> we<00:04:01.760> can<00:04:01.940> get<00:04:02.150> I'm<00:04:02.360> going<00:04:02.570> to

00:04:02.860 --> 00:04:02.870 
kind of range we can get I'm going to

00:04:02.870 --> 00:04:04.990 
kind of range we can get I'm going to
leave<00:04:03.200> the<00:04:03.380> studio<00:04:03.710> here<00:04:04.010> walk<00:04:04.280> through<00:04:04.580> three

00:04:04.990 --> 00:04:05.000 
leave the studio here walk through three

00:04:05.000 --> 00:04:07.720 
leave the studio here walk through three
sets<00:04:05.240> of<00:04:05.360> steel<00:04:05.570> doors<00:04:05.870> and<00:04:06.400> we'll<00:04:07.400> just<00:04:07.610> see

00:04:07.720 --> 00:04:07.730 
sets of steel doors and we'll just see

00:04:07.730 --> 00:04:10.810 
sets of steel doors and we'll just see
how<00:04:07.880> well<00:04:08.680> obviously<00:04:09.680> they<00:04:10.250> they<00:04:10.580> always

00:04:10.810 --> 00:04:10.820 
how well obviously they they always

00:04:10.820 --> 00:04:12.220 
how well obviously they they always
recommend<00:04:11.300> that<00:04:11.330> you<00:04:11.450> stay<00:04:11.630> line<00:04:11.840> of<00:04:11.990> sight

00:04:12.220 --> 00:04:12.230 
recommend that you stay line of sight

00:04:12.230 --> 00:04:14.740 
recommend that you stay line of sight
with<00:04:12.830> these<00:04:12.980> type<00:04:13.220> of<00:04:13.250> devices<00:04:13.700> but<00:04:14.510> I<00:04:14.570> thought

00:04:14.740 --> 00:04:14.750 
with these type of devices but I thought

00:04:14.750 --> 00:04:16.390 
with these type of devices but I thought
this<00:04:14.930> would<00:04:15.080> demonstrate<00:04:15.590> a<00:04:15.620> little<00:04:15.890> bit<00:04:16.070> just

00:04:16.390 --> 00:04:16.400 
this would demonstrate a little bit just

00:04:16.400 --> 00:04:19.570 
this would demonstrate a little bit just
how<00:04:16.640> good<00:04:17.540> this<00:04:17.989> particular<00:04:18.350> system<00:04:18.800> is<00:04:19.070> I've

00:04:19.570 --> 00:04:19.580 
how good this particular system is I've

00:04:19.580 --> 00:04:21.550 
how good this particular system is I've
been<00:04:19.790> using<00:04:19.940> this<00:04:20.180> system<00:04:20.390> on<00:04:20.810> the<00:04:20.989> road<00:04:21.170> for

00:04:21.550 --> 00:04:21.560 
been using this system on the road for

00:04:21.560 --> 00:04:24.160 
been using this system on the road for
the<00:04:21.860> past<00:04:22.400> six<00:04:22.700> months<00:04:22.790> and<00:04:23.360> really<00:04:23.900> enjoyed

00:04:24.160 --> 00:04:24.170 
the past six months and really enjoyed

00:04:24.170 --> 00:04:26.080 
the past six months and really enjoyed
using<00:04:24.380> it<00:04:24.680> that's<00:04:25.070> three<00:04:25.460> sets<00:04:25.730> of<00:04:25.850> steel

00:04:26.080 --> 00:04:26.090 
using it that's three sets of steel

00:04:26.090 --> 00:04:28.180 
using it that's three sets of steel
doors<00:04:26.360> that<00:04:27.080> have<00:04:27.200> just<00:04:27.410> walked<00:04:27.620> through<00:04:27.770> and

00:04:28.180 --> 00:04:28.190 
doors that have just walked through and

00:04:28.190 --> 00:04:29.860 
doors that have just walked through and
I'm<00:04:28.520> assuming<00:04:28.910> you<00:04:28.970> can<00:04:29.150> still<00:04:29.390> hear<00:04:29.570> me<00:04:29.630> just

00:04:29.860 --> 00:04:29.870 
I'm assuming you can still hear me just

00:04:29.870 --> 00:04:33.880 
I'm assuming you can still hear me just
fine<00:04:29.960> in<00:04:30.350> there<00:04:31.390> and<00:04:32.390> now<00:04:32.570> I'm<00:04:32.690> back<00:04:32.870> and<00:04:33.200> that

00:04:33.880 --> 00:04:33.890 
fine in there and now I'm back and that

00:04:33.890 --> 00:04:34.990 
fine in there and now I'm back and that
will<00:04:33.980> give<00:04:34.100> you<00:04:34.190> a<00:04:34.250> little<00:04:34.400> bit<00:04:34.550> of<00:04:34.610> an<00:04:34.730> idea

00:04:34.990 --> 00:04:35.000 
will give you a little bit of an idea

00:04:35.000 --> 00:04:37.720 
will give you a little bit of an idea
the<00:04:35.480> arrange<00:04:35.870> on<00:04:36.080> this<00:04:36.200> is<00:04:36.350> a<00:04:36.380> about<00:04:36.950> 300<00:04:37.490> feet

00:04:37.720 --> 00:04:37.730 
the arrange on this is a about 300 feet

00:04:37.730 --> 00:04:40.960 
the arrange on this is a about 300 feet
line<00:04:38.210> of<00:04:38.360> sight<00:04:38.630> but<00:04:39.320> I<00:04:39.740> have<00:04:40.100> found<00:04:40.430> that<00:04:40.760> in

00:04:40.960 --> 00:04:40.970 
line of sight but I have found that in

00:04:40.970 --> 00:04:43.390 
line of sight but I have found that in
most<00:04:41.210> cases<00:04:41.540> I<00:04:41.990> can<00:04:42.560> be<00:04:42.680> far<00:04:42.920> enough<00:04:43.010> away<00:04:43.190> from

00:04:43.390 --> 00:04:43.400 
most cases I can be far enough away from

00:04:43.400 --> 00:04:45.880 
most cases I can be far enough away from
my<00:04:43.640> system<00:04:44.030> that<00:04:44.210> I<00:04:44.240> can<00:04:44.390> actually<00:04:45.290> be<00:04:45.710> heard

00:04:45.880 --> 00:04:45.890 
my system that I can actually be heard

00:04:45.890 --> 00:04:47.440 
my system that I can actually be heard
through<00:04:46.160> the<00:04:46.190> system<00:04:46.700> when<00:04:46.820> I<00:04:46.850> can't<00:04:47.240> actually

00:04:47.440 --> 00:04:47.450 
through the system when I can't actually

00:04:47.450 --> 00:04:49.750 
through the system when I can't actually
even<00:04:47.750> hear<00:04:48.020> the<00:04:48.170> system<00:04:48.530> so<00:04:49.070> it's<00:04:49.280> a<00:04:49.400> it's<00:04:49.640> a

00:04:49.750 --> 00:04:49.760 
even hear the system so it's a it's a

00:04:49.760 --> 00:04:52.480 
even hear the system so it's a it's a
very<00:04:49.790> very<00:04:50.270> good<00:04:50.720> system<00:04:51.230> it's<00:04:51.530> we<00:04:52.040> put<00:04:52.250> one<00:04:52.400> of

00:04:52.480 --> 00:04:52.490 
very very good system it's we put one of

00:04:52.490 --> 00:04:53.680 
very very good system it's we put one of
these<00:04:52.550> in<00:04:52.700> our<00:04:52.820> churches<00:04:53.060> well<00:04:53.390> we've<00:04:53.570> had

00:04:53.680 --> 00:04:53.690 
these in our churches well we've had

00:04:53.690 --> 00:04:54.520 
these in our churches well we've had
great<00:04:53.870> luck<00:04:54.080> with<00:04:54.260> it

00:04:54.520 --> 00:04:54.530 
great luck with it

00:04:54.530 --> 00:04:58.240 
great luck with it
very<00:04:55.310> rugged<00:04:55.610> system<00:04:56.290> no<00:04:57.290> problems<00:04:57.800> in<00:04:58.130> the

00:04:58.240 --> 00:04:58.250 
very rugged system no problems in the

00:04:58.250 --> 00:04:59.710 
very rugged system no problems in the
last<00:04:58.460> six<00:04:58.700> months<00:04:58.760> we've<00:04:59.120> been<00:04:59.150> using<00:04:59.450> this

00:04:59.710 --> 00:04:59.720 
last six months we've been using this

00:04:59.720 --> 00:05:02.350 
last six months we've been using this
and<00:05:00.050> we've<00:05:00.980> really<00:05:01.280> found<00:05:01.790> this<00:05:01.970> to<00:05:02.120> be<00:05:02.150> one<00:05:02.330> of

00:05:02.350 --> 00:05:02.360 
and we've really found this to be one of

00:05:02.360 --> 00:05:04.630 
and we've really found this to be one of
the<00:05:02.510> best<00:05:02.770> wireless<00:05:03.770> mics<00:05:03.980> been<00:05:04.190> found<00:05:04.400> and

00:05:04.630 --> 00:05:04.640 
the best wireless mics been found and

00:05:04.640 --> 00:05:09.340 
the best wireless mics been found and
using<00:05:04.910> this<00:05:05.290> head<00:05:06.290> warm<00:05:06.530> system<00:05:07.160> is<00:05:07.640> is<00:05:08.390> also<00:05:09.080> a

00:05:09.340 --> 00:05:09.350 
using this head warm system is is also a

00:05:09.350 --> 00:05:11.050 
using this head warm system is is also a
real<00:05:09.740> plus<00:05:10.010> because<00:05:10.340> it's<00:05:10.460> very<00:05:10.640> comfortable

00:05:11.050 --> 00:05:11.060 
real plus because it's very comfortable

00:05:11.060 --> 00:05:13.330 
real plus because it's very comfortable
and<00:05:11.420> very<00:05:12.050> easy<00:05:12.110> to<00:05:12.350> use<00:05:12.470> and<00:05:12.920> that's<00:05:13.190> the

00:05:13.330 --> 00:05:13.340 
and very easy to use and that's the
