last night we had a dinghy adrift in the

00:01:20.130 --> 00:01:22.069 
last night we had a dinghy adrift in the
Anchorage<00:01:20.520> here<00:01:20.700> that<00:01:20.850> was<00:01:20.939> exciting<00:01:21.270> it's

00:01:22.069 --> 00:01:22.079 
Anchorage here that was exciting it's

00:01:22.079 --> 00:01:24.499 
Anchorage here that was exciting it's
kind<00:01:22.259> of<00:01:22.320> a<00:01:22.380> lesson<00:01:22.619> in<00:01:22.799> there<00:01:23.009> too<00:01:23.189> I<00:01:23.219> think<00:01:23.610> as

00:01:24.499 --> 00:01:24.509 
kind of a lesson in there too I think as

00:01:24.509 --> 00:01:26.359 
kind of a lesson in there too I think as
one<00:01:24.990> of<00:01:25.020> the<00:01:25.140> boats<00:01:25.320> just<00:01:25.590> a<00:01:25.740> couple<00:01:25.950> up<00:01:26.159> from

00:01:26.359 --> 00:01:26.369 
one of the boats just a couple up from

00:01:26.369 --> 00:01:28.429 
one of the boats just a couple up from
us<00:01:26.520> I<00:01:26.729> guess<00:01:27.030> the<00:01:27.329> dinghy<00:01:27.539> painter<00:01:28.020> came<00:01:28.229> off

00:01:28.429 --> 00:01:28.439 
us I guess the dinghy painter came off

00:01:28.439 --> 00:01:32.959 
us I guess the dinghy painter came off
it<00:01:29.340> was<00:01:29.490> night<00:01:29.729> the<00:01:30.119> moon<00:01:30.329> was<00:01:30.539> up<00:01:30.570> and<00:01:31.969> he

00:01:32.959 --> 00:01:32.969 
it was night the moon was up and he

00:01:32.969 --> 00:01:34.969 
it was night the moon was up and he
thought<00:01:33.210> he<00:01:33.359> could<00:01:33.390> catch<00:01:34.079> it<00:01:34.320> before<00:01:34.740> it

00:01:34.969 --> 00:01:34.979 
thought he could catch it before it

00:01:34.979 --> 00:01:37.609 
thought he could catch it before it
floated<00:01:35.280> away<00:01:35.369> too<00:01:35.490> far<00:01:36.200> he<00:01:37.200> jumped<00:01:37.469> in<00:01:37.560> the

00:01:37.609 --> 00:01:37.619 
floated away too far he jumped in the

00:01:37.619 --> 00:01:39.410 
floated away too far he jumped in the
water<00:01:37.770> but<00:01:38.219> luckily<00:01:38.640> he<00:01:38.820> thought<00:01:39.090> to<00:01:39.210> put<00:01:39.390> a

00:01:39.410 --> 00:01:39.420 
water but luckily he thought to put a

00:01:39.420 --> 00:01:41.719 
water but luckily he thought to put a
lifejacket<00:01:39.600> on<00:01:40.049> first<00:01:40.380> I<00:01:40.710> jumped<00:01:41.609> in<00:01:41.700> the

00:01:41.719 --> 00:01:41.729 
lifejacket on first I jumped in the

00:01:41.729 --> 00:01:44.870 
lifejacket on first I jumped in the
water<00:01:41.789> and<00:01:42.210> swam<00:01:42.539> after<00:01:42.750> the<00:01:42.990> dinghy<00:01:43.200> and<00:01:43.880> with

00:01:44.870 --> 00:01:44.880 
water and swam after the dinghy and with

00:01:44.880 --> 00:01:46.819 
water and swam after the dinghy and with
even<00:01:45.270> the<00:01:45.359> wind<00:01:45.600> is<00:01:45.719> fairly<00:01:45.899> light<00:01:46.229> still<00:01:46.679> the

00:01:46.819 --> 00:01:46.829 
even the wind is fairly light still the

00:01:46.829 --> 00:01:48.349 
even the wind is fairly light still the
thing<00:01:47.009> he<00:01:47.100> drifted<00:01:47.460> away<00:01:47.609> faster<00:01:48.119> than<00:01:48.270> he

00:01:48.349 --> 00:01:48.359 
thing he drifted away faster than he

00:01:48.359 --> 00:01:50.300 
thing he drifted away faster than he
could<00:01:48.479> swim<00:01:48.780> so<00:01:49.109> we<00:01:49.500> were<00:01:49.590> down<00:01:49.740> below<00:01:49.950> decks

00:01:50.300 --> 00:01:50.310 
could swim so we were down below decks

00:01:50.310 --> 00:01:52.130 
could swim so we were down below decks
and<00:01:50.850> the<00:01:50.969> first<00:01:51.179> thing<00:01:51.359> we<00:01:51.450> heard<00:01:51.630> was<00:01:51.659> a<00:01:51.840> kind

00:01:52.130 --> 00:01:52.140 
and the first thing we heard was a kind

00:01:52.140 --> 00:01:57.109 
and the first thing we heard was a kind
of<00:01:52.259> Oh<00:01:53.479> coming<00:01:54.479> from<00:01:54.679> outside<00:01:55.679> so<00:01:56.609> we<00:01:56.759> came<00:01:56.909> out

00:01:57.109 --> 00:01:57.119 
of Oh coming from outside so we came out

00:01:57.119 --> 00:02:00.360 
of Oh coming from outside so we came out
and<00:01:57.329> he<00:01:57.509> was<00:01:57.630> swimming<00:01:58.350> past<00:01:58.649> the<00:01:58.829> boat

00:02:00.360 --> 00:02:00.370

dinging<00:02:00.880> so<00:02:01.120> I<00:02:01.540> think<00:02:01.870> there's<00:02:02.140> a<00:02:02.170> lesson<00:02:02.560> that

00:02:02.580 --> 00:02:02.590 
dinging so I think there's a lesson that
