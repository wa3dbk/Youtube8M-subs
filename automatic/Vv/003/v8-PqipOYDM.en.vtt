automatically turns off in the night so
first<00:00:17.949> off<00:00:18.130> we're<00:00:18.340> going<00:00:18.460> to<00:00:18.520> me<00:00:18.610> to<00:00:18.850> break

00:00:19.110 --> 00:00:19.120 
first off we're going to me to break

00:00:19.120 --> 00:00:20.970 
first off we're going to me to break
these<00:00:19.270> two<00:00:19.480> blocks<00:00:19.750> there's<00:00:20.560> a<00:00:20.620> matter<00:00:20.770> what

00:00:20.970 --> 00:00:20.980 
these two blocks there's a matter what

00:00:20.980 --> 00:00:24.320 
these two blocks there's a matter what
type<00:00:21.190> brick<00:00:21.400> break<00:00:22.240> block<00:00:22.540> whatever<00:00:22.810> it<00:00:22.990> is

type brick break block whatever it is

00:00:24.330 --> 00:00:28.140 
type brick break block whatever it is
we're<00:00:25.330> going<00:00:25.420> to<00:00:25.480> put<00:00:25.750> a<00:00:25.810> piston<00:00:26.410> there<00:00:27.150> then

00:00:28.140 --> 00:00:28.150 
we're going to put a piston there then

00:00:28.150 --> 00:00:32.339 
we're going to put a piston there then
redstone<00:00:28.660> wiring<00:00:28.870> wrapping<00:00:29.350> around<00:00:31.349> put

00:00:32.339 --> 00:00:32.349 
redstone wiring wrapping around put

00:00:32.349 --> 00:00:36.180 
redstone wiring wrapping around put
three<00:00:32.559> blocks<00:00:33.059> stacked<00:00:34.059> to<00:00:34.300> right<00:00:34.540> here<00:00:35.190> and

00:00:36.180 --> 00:00:36.190 
three blocks stacked to right here and

00:00:36.190 --> 00:00:40.680 
three blocks stacked to right here and
we're<00:00:37.180> going<00:00:37.270> to<00:00:37.329> bring<00:00:37.720> this<00:00:37.900> back<00:00:38.410> here<00:00:39.690> and

00:00:40.680 --> 00:00:40.690 
we're going to bring this back here and

00:00:40.690 --> 00:00:45.590 
we're going to bring this back here and
put<00:00:41.410> a<00:00:41.650> to<00:00:42.010> tick<00:00:42.220> delay<00:00:42.720> bring<00:00:43.720> it<00:00:43.810> back<00:00:43.930> up<00:00:43.980> and

00:00:45.590 --> 00:00:45.600 
put a to tick delay bring it back up and

00:00:45.600 --> 00:00:49.910 
put a to tick delay bring it back up and
that<00:00:46.600> that<00:00:47.079> will<00:00:47.290> start<00:00:47.800> a<00:00:47.860> bud<00:00:48.010> switch<00:00:48.899> and

00:00:49.910 --> 00:00:49.920 
that that will start a bud switch and

00:00:49.920 --> 00:00:52.920 
that that will start a bud switch and
now<00:00:50.920> we<00:00:50.980> have<00:00:51.130> a<00:00:51.160> bud<00:00:51.340> switch<00:00:51.600> um<00:00:52.600> i<00:00:52.750> would

00:00:52.920 --> 00:00:52.930 
now we have a bud switch um i would

00:00:52.930 --> 00:00:54.840 
now we have a bud switch um i would
recommend<00:00:53.380> changing<00:00:53.739> this<00:00:53.860> because<00:00:54.309> we<00:00:54.640> cover

00:00:54.840 --> 00:00:54.850 
recommend changing this because we cover

00:00:54.850 --> 00:00:58.350 
recommend changing this because we cover
it<00:00:54.940> up<00:00:55.030> and<00:00:55.239> you'll<00:00:55.360> want<00:00:55.510> that<00:00:55.630> triggering<00:00:57.360> so

00:00:58.350 --> 00:00:58.360 
it up and you'll want that triggering so

00:00:58.360 --> 00:00:59.460 
it up and you'll want that triggering so
now<00:00:58.510> thats<00:00:58.690> actually<00:00:58.840> makes<00:00:59.200> the<00:00:59.260> lights

00:00:59.460 --> 00:00:59.470 
now thats actually makes the lights

00:00:59.470 --> 00:01:00.990 
now thats actually makes the lights
which<00:00:59.649> part<00:00:59.860> of<00:00:59.920> it<00:01:00.010> so<00:01:00.370> we're<00:01:00.730> going<00:01:00.820> to<00:01:00.910> need

00:01:00.990 --> 00:01:01.000 
which part of it so we're going to need

00:01:01.000 --> 00:01:03.389 
which part of it so we're going to need
a<00:01:01.059> piss<00:01:01.270> in<00:01:01.300> there<00:01:01.649> here's<00:01:02.649> our<00:01:02.800> trigger<00:01:03.130> block

00:01:03.389 --> 00:01:03.399 
a piss in there here's our trigger block

00:01:03.399 --> 00:01:06.790 
a piss in there here's our trigger block
and

00:01:06.790 --> 00:01:06.800 

00:01:06.800 --> 00:01:10.890 

here's<00:01:07.700> going<00:01:07.850> to<00:01:07.910> be<00:01:08.030> our<00:01:08.300> main<00:01:08.630> water<00:01:09.560> part

00:01:10.890 --> 00:01:10.900 
here's going to be our main water part

00:01:10.900 --> 00:01:15.010 
here's going to be our main water part
water<00:01:11.900> carrying<00:01:12.290> part<00:01:13.180> so<00:01:14.180> make<00:01:14.570> like<00:01:14.720> an<00:01:14.840> L<00:01:14.990> on

00:01:15.010 --> 00:01:15.020 
water carrying part so make like an L on

00:01:15.020 --> 00:01:17.530 
water carrying part so make like an L on
top<00:01:15.320> put<00:01:16.250> a<00:01:16.310> ladder<00:01:16.550> right<00:01:16.700> here<00:01:17.060> to<00:01:17.210> keep<00:01:17.360> the

00:01:17.530 --> 00:01:17.540 
top put a ladder right here to keep the

00:01:17.540 --> 00:01:21.010 
top put a ladder right here to keep the
water<00:01:17.690> in<00:01:18.910> then<00:01:19.910> we're<00:01:20.420> going<00:01:20.510> to<00:01:20.570> want<00:01:20.750> to<00:01:20.810> put

00:01:21.010 --> 00:01:21.020 
water in then we're going to want to put

00:01:21.020 --> 00:01:24.490 
water in then we're going to want to put
dirt<00:01:21.380> blocks<00:01:22.780> covering<00:01:23.780> right<00:01:23.960> there<00:01:24.200> so<00:01:24.470> that

00:01:24.490 --> 00:01:24.500 
dirt blocks covering right there so that

00:01:24.500 --> 00:01:27.940 
dirt blocks covering right there so that
way<00:01:24.710> the<00:01:24.860> grass<00:01:25.100> can<00:01:25.310> spread<00:01:26.590> and<00:01:27.590> then<00:01:27.740> after

00:01:27.940 --> 00:01:27.950 
way the grass can spread and then after

00:01:27.950 --> 00:01:30.730 
way the grass can spread and then after
that<00:01:28.070> we<00:01:28.220> put<00:01:28.430> water<00:01:28.870> and<00:01:29.870> that's<00:01:30.500> how<00:01:30.680> you

00:01:30.730 --> 00:01:30.740 
that we put water and that's how you

00:01:30.740 --> 00:01:33.660 
that we put water and that's how you
make<00:01:30.890> your<00:01:30.950> light<00:01:31.160> switch<00:01:31.370> how<00:01:32.030> this<00:01:32.240> works

00:01:33.660 --> 00:01:33.670 
make your light switch how this works

00:01:33.670 --> 00:01:35.950 
make your light switch how this works
sensors<00:01:34.670> one<00:01:34.850> on<00:01:34.970> top<00:01:35.150> this<00:01:35.330> is<00:01:35.390> in<00:01:35.600> day<00:01:35.780> mode

00:01:35.950 --> 00:01:35.960 
sensors one on top this is in day mode

00:01:35.960 --> 00:01:41.650 
sensors one on top this is in day mode
right<00:01:36.110> now<00:01:36.170> if<00:01:36.470> I<00:01:38.320> go<00:01:39.320> to<00:01:39.500> night<00:01:40.390> grass<00:01:41.390> will

00:01:41.650 --> 00:01:41.660 
right now if I go to night grass will

00:01:41.660 --> 00:01:43.510 
right now if I go to night grass will
die<00:01:41.810> if<00:01:42.050> it's<00:01:42.230> under<00:01:42.350> water<00:01:42.620> but<00:01:43.040> only<00:01:43.280> if<00:01:43.370> its

00:01:43.510 --> 00:01:43.520 
die if it's under water but only if its

00:01:43.520 --> 00:01:47.500 
die if it's under water but only if its
own<00:01:43.640> at<00:01:43.880> a<00:01:43.910> certain<00:01:44.180> light<00:01:44.450> level<00:01:46.300> this<00:01:47.300> will

00:01:47.500 --> 00:01:47.510 
own at a certain light level this will

00:01:47.510 --> 00:01:49.390 
own at a certain light level this will
take<00:01:47.660> a<00:01:47.720> second<00:01:48.170> I'm<00:01:48.650> going<00:01:48.830> to<00:01:48.920> go<00:01:49.130> ahead<00:01:49.160> and

00:01:49.390 --> 00:01:49.400 
take a second I'm going to go ahead and

00:01:49.400 --> 00:01:54.250 
take a second I'm going to go ahead and
kind<00:01:49.760> of<00:01:49.910> manually<00:01:50.510> trigger<00:01:50.660> it<00:01:52.810> so<00:01:53.810> say<00:01:54.140> it

00:01:54.250 --> 00:01:54.260 
kind of manually trigger it so say it

00:01:54.260 --> 00:01:58.150 
kind of manually trigger it so say it
was<00:01:54.350> nighttime<00:01:54.650> and<00:01:54.760> I<00:01:56.710> triggered<00:01:57.710> it<00:01:57.800> now

00:01:58.150 --> 00:01:58.160 
was nighttime and I triggered it now

00:01:58.160 --> 00:01:59.740 
was nighttime and I triggered it now
it's<00:01:58.400> going<00:01:58.580> to<00:01:58.670> be<00:01:58.970> now<00:01:59.360> we<00:01:59.450> gotta<00:01:59.600> wait<00:01:59.690> for

00:01:59.740 --> 00:01:59.750 
it's going to be now we gotta wait for

00:01:59.750 --> 00:02:01.270 
it's going to be now we gotta wait for
the<00:01:59.900> grass<00:02:00.080> grow<00:02:00.320> back<00:02:00.470> because<00:02:00.920> now<00:02:01.220> the

00:02:01.270 --> 00:02:01.280 
the grass grow back because now the

00:02:01.280 --> 00:02:05.590 
the grass grow back because now the
water<00:02:01.610> is<00:02:01.670> not<00:02:01.820> on<00:02:01.940> top<00:02:02.120> of<00:02:02.270> it<00:02:02.390> and<00:02:02.600> so<00:02:04.330> the<00:02:05.330> Sun

00:02:05.590 --> 00:02:05.600 
water is not on top of it and so the Sun

00:02:05.600 --> 00:02:07.780 
water is not on top of it and so the Sun
which<00:02:05.810> is<00:02:05.930> over<00:02:06.110> there<00:02:06.370> will<00:02:07.370> give<00:02:07.610> this<00:02:07.730> a

00:02:07.780 --> 00:02:07.790 
which is over there will give this a

00:02:07.790 --> 00:02:09.370 
which is over there will give this a
certain<00:02:08.149> light<00:02:08.270> level<00:02:08.540> and<00:02:08.720> that<00:02:08.750> wool<00:02:09.110> and

00:02:09.370 --> 00:02:09.380 
certain light level and that wool and

00:02:09.380 --> 00:02:11.440 
certain light level and that wool and
grasp<00:02:09.710> right<00:02:10.040> down<00:02:10.220> to<00:02:10.369> there<00:02:10.550> and<00:02:10.790> cause<00:02:11.300> it

00:02:11.440 --> 00:02:11.450 
grasp right down to there and cause it

00:02:11.450 --> 00:02:16.180 
grasp right down to there and cause it
to<00:02:11.480> trigger<00:02:11.870> again<00:02:12.400> I<00:02:13.959> could<00:02:14.959> just<00:02:15.140> did<00:02:15.350> so

00:02:16.180 --> 00:02:16.190 
to trigger again I could just did so

00:02:16.190 --> 00:02:19.570 
to trigger again I could just did so
crash<00:02:16.520> screw<00:02:16.820> and<00:02:17.030> it<00:02:17.120> triggered

00:02:19.570 --> 00:02:19.580 

00:02:19.580 --> 00:02:21.130 

and<00:02:19.820> now<00:02:20.330> we're<00:02:20.420> going<00:02:20.540> to<00:02:20.630> bring<00:02:20.750> this<00:02:20.930> out

00:02:21.130 --> 00:02:21.140

00:02:25.030 --> 00:02:25.040 
and when it's on that means night mode

00:02:25.040 --> 00:02:28.000 
and when it's on that means night mode
and<00:02:25.370> if<00:02:25.700> it's<00:02:25.850> backwards<00:02:26.300> and<00:02:26.650> that's<00:02:27.650> not

00:02:28.000 --> 00:02:28.010 
and if it's backwards and that's not

00:02:28.010 --> 00:02:30.580 
and if it's backwards and that's not
correct<00:02:28.450> and<00:02:29.450> I<00:02:29.570> got<00:02:29.720> to<00:02:29.810> do<00:02:29.870> is<00:02:29.960> put<00:02:29.990> a<00:02:30.200> torch

00:02:30.580 --> 00:02:30.590 
correct and I got to do is put a torch

00:02:30.590 --> 00:02:33.760 
correct and I got to do is put a torch
there<00:02:30.830> and<00:02:31.130> it<00:02:31.640> but<00:02:32.000> makes<00:02:32.240> it<00:02:32.420> a<00:02:32.600> all<00:02:33.380> correct

00:02:33.760 --> 00:02:33.770 
there and it but makes it a all correct

00:02:33.770 --> 00:02:39.420 
there and it but makes it a all correct
so<00:02:34.670> you<00:02:34.760> can<00:02:35.000> use<00:02:35.180> a<00:02:36.280> torch<00:02:37.280> indicate<00:02:37.840> day<00:02:38.840> or

00:02:39.420 --> 00:02:39.430

00:02:39.430 --> 00:02:45.610 
so you can use a torch indicate day or
