as<00:00:14.519> we<00:00:14.639> go<00:00:14.790> through<00:00:15.059> the<00:00:15.179> night<00:00:15.269> just<00:00:15.540> a<00:00:15.630> few

00:00:18.200 --> 00:00:18.210 
lingering mainly along the coast I think

00:00:18.210 --> 00:00:19.730 
lingering mainly along the coast I think
by<00:00:18.330> the<00:00:18.390> morning<00:00:18.750> and<00:00:18.869> many<00:00:19.080> places<00:00:19.380> will<00:00:19.710> be

00:00:19.730 --> 00:00:19.740 
by the morning and many places will be

00:00:19.740 --> 00:00:21.560 
by the morning and many places will be
dry<00:00:20.039> by<00:00:20.250> the<00:00:20.310> morning<00:00:20.699> temperatures<00:00:21.390> at<00:00:21.480> the

00:00:21.560 --> 00:00:21.570 
dry by the morning temperatures at the

00:00:21.570 --> 00:00:22.700 
dry by the morning temperatures at the
lowest<00:00:21.840> around<00:00:22.050> about<00:00:22.199> 10:00<00:00:22.500> or<00:00:22.529> 11:00

00:00:22.700 --> 00:00:22.710 
lowest around about 10:00 or 11:00

00:00:22.710 --> 00:00:25.099 
lowest around about 10:00 or 11:00
that's<00:00:23.189> 52<00:00:23.580> 52<00:00:24.000> Fahrenheit<00:00:24.570> and<00:00:24.660> just<00:00:24.840> liked

00:00:25.099 --> 00:00:25.109 
that's 52 52 Fahrenheit and just liked

00:00:25.109 --> 00:00:27.380 
that's 52 52 Fahrenheit and just liked
northwesterly<00:00:26.039> breezes<00:00:26.340> around<00:00:26.640> about<00:00:26.820> a<00:00:26.849> 4-3

00:00:27.380 --> 00:00:27.390 
northwesterly breezes around about a 4-3

00:00:27.390 --> 00:00:28.970 
northwesterly breezes around about a 4-3
or<00:00:27.420> force<00:00:27.810> for<00:00:28.080> over<00:00:28.109> those<00:00:28.529> inshore<00:00:28.920> waters

00:00:28.970 --> 00:00:28.980 
or force for over those inshore waters

00:00:28.980 --> 00:00:31.460 
or force for over those inshore waters
so<00:00:29.939> a<00:00:29.970> rather<00:00:30.150> dull<00:00:30.480> and<00:00:30.750> a<00:00:30.810> gray<00:00:30.960> start<00:00:31.349> there

00:00:31.460 --> 00:00:31.470 
so a rather dull and a gray start there

00:00:31.470 --> 00:00:32.810 
so a rather dull and a gray start there
will<00:00:31.560> be<00:00:31.590> a<00:00:31.679> little<00:00:31.830> bit<00:00:31.949> mist<00:00:32.130> and<00:00:32.279> fog<00:00:32.460> very

you can see a few showers around but the

00:00:38.040 --> 00:00:39.950 
you can see a few showers around but the
Sun<00:00:38.219> will<00:00:38.430> eventually<00:00:39.000> break<00:00:39.210> through<00:00:39.510> to

give us all a little bit of sunshine
through<00:00:41.640> the<00:00:41.700> afternoon<00:00:41.820> but<00:00:42.450> those

00:00:42.860 --> 00:00:42.870 
through the afternoon but those

00:00:42.870 --> 00:00:45.080 
through the afternoon but those
temperatures<00:00:43.170> lifting<00:00:43.620> to<00:00:43.710> 18<00:00:44.100> or<00:00:44.280> 19<00:00:44.309> mean<00:00:45.000> we

00:00:45.080 --> 00:00:45.090 
temperatures lifting to 18 or 19 mean we

00:00:45.090 --> 00:00:46.340 
temperatures lifting to 18 or 19 mean we
are<00:00:45.239> going<00:00:45.450> to<00:00:45.539> see<00:00:45.690> some<00:00:45.870> quite<00:00:46.110> heavy

00:00:46.340 --> 00:00:46.350 
are going to see some quite heavy

00:00:46.350 --> 00:00:48.470 
are going to see some quite heavy
showers<00:00:46.800> developing<00:00:47.250> and<00:00:47.789> most<00:00:48.000> of<00:00:48.180> those<00:00:48.270> I

00:00:48.470 --> 00:00:48.480 
showers developing and most of those I

00:00:48.480 --> 00:00:49.910 
showers developing and most of those I
think<00:00:48.510> will<00:00:48.840> be<00:00:48.960> away<00:00:49.289> from<00:00:49.350> the<00:00:49.680> coast

00:00:49.910 --> 00:00:49.920 
think will be away from the coast

00:00:49.920 --> 00:00:51.619 
think will be away from the coast
especially<00:00:50.129> over<00:00:50.730> the<00:00:50.760> higher<00:00:51.090> ground<00:00:51.420> of<00:00:51.539> the

00:00:51.619 --> 00:00:51.629 
especially over the higher ground of the

00:00:51.629 --> 00:00:53.810 
especially over the higher ground of the
Downs<00:00:51.870> and<00:00:52.170> the<00:00:52.260> wheels<00:00:52.469> and<00:00:52.860> over<00:00:53.280> Cranborne

Downs and the wheels and over Cranborne

00:00:53.820 --> 00:00:55.790 
Downs and the wheels and over Cranborne
chase<00:00:54.180> as<00:00:54.449> well<00:00:54.660> and<00:00:54.960> they<00:00:55.199> could<00:00:55.260> well<00:00:55.620> be<00:00:55.770> a

00:00:55.790 --> 00:00:55.800 
chase as well and they could well be a

00:00:55.800 --> 00:00:57.920 
chase as well and they could well be a
rumble<00:00:56.219> or<00:00:56.309> two<00:00:56.370> of<00:00:56.550> thunder<00:00:56.670> mixed<00:00:57.270> in<00:00:57.420> now

00:00:57.920 --> 00:00:57.930 
rumble or two of thunder mixed in now

00:00:57.930 --> 00:00:59.029

again<00:00:58.170> we're<00:00:58.260> going<00:00:58.350> to<00:00:58.530> see<00:00:58.620> some<00:00:58.800> quite

00:00:59.029 --> 00:00:59.039 
again we're going to see some quite

00:00:59.039 --> 00:01:00.950 
again we're going to see some quite
light<00:00:59.309> winds<00:00:59.550> so<00:00:59.789> wherever<00:01:00.090> those<00:01:00.270> showers<00:01:00.750> do

00:01:00.950 --> 00:01:00.960 
light winds so wherever those showers do

00:01:00.960 --> 00:01:02.479 
light winds so wherever those showers do
pop<00:01:01.230> up<00:01:01.260> you're<00:01:01.590> going<00:01:01.710> to<00:01:01.770> see<00:01:01.949> quite<00:01:02.250> a
