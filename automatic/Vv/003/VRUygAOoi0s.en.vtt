I just showed up here in Moab once again

00:00:04.319 --> 00:00:06.289 
I just showed up here in Moab once again
with<00:00:04.620> Matt<00:00:04.830> hacker<00:00:05.100> so<00:00:05.879> here<00:00:06.029> we<00:00:06.150> have<00:00:06.270> a

00:00:06.289 --> 00:00:06.299 
with Matt hacker so here we have a

00:00:06.299 --> 00:00:09.799 
with Matt hacker so here we have a
250-foot<00:00:07.200> whoops<00:00:07.560> ray<00:00:08.389> never<00:00:09.389> jumped<00:00:09.660> off<00:00:09.750> a

00:00:09.799 --> 00:00:09.809 
250-foot whoops ray never jumped off a

00:00:09.809 --> 00:00:16.160 
250-foot whoops ray never jumped off a
cliff<00:00:09.840> this<00:00:10.080> big<00:00:10.290> without<00:00:10.469> a<00:00:10.500> parachute<00:00:15.170> and

00:00:16.160 --> 00:00:16.170 
cliff this big without a parachute and

00:00:16.170 --> 00:00:18.560 
cliff this big without a parachute and
now<00:00:16.320> we're<00:00:16.470> measuring<00:00:16.650> the<00:00:17.640> first<00:00:18.029> length<00:00:18.390> of

00:00:18.560 --> 00:00:18.570 
now we're measuring the first length of

00:00:18.570 --> 00:00:20.269 
now we're measuring the first length of
rope<00:00:18.750> Hector<00:00:19.439> what's<00:00:19.619> your<00:00:19.710> thought<00:00:19.859> process

00:00:20.269 --> 00:00:20.279 
rope Hector what's your thought process

00:00:20.279 --> 00:00:22.910 
rope Hector what's your thought process
how<00:00:20.430> do<00:00:20.490> we<00:00:20.699> measure<00:00:20.910> the<00:00:21.500> right<00:00:22.500> length<00:00:22.740> of

00:00:22.910 --> 00:00:22.920 
how do we measure the right length of

00:00:22.920 --> 00:00:25.759 
how do we measure the right length of
rope<00:00:23.070> we're<00:00:24.000> basically<00:00:24.269> starting<00:00:24.630> with<00:00:24.810> how

00:00:25.759 --> 00:00:25.769 
rope we're basically starting with how

00:00:25.769 --> 00:00:27.970 
rope we're basically starting with how
much<00:00:26.099> vertical<00:00:26.789> area<00:00:26.970> we<00:00:27.210> know<00:00:27.390> we<00:00:27.539> have

00:00:27.970 --> 00:00:27.980 
much vertical area we know we have

00:00:27.980 --> 00:00:32.389 
much vertical area we know we have
pretty<00:00:28.980> much<00:00:29.070> cutting<00:00:29.580> it<00:00:29.699> in<00:00:29.789> half<00:00:31.279> this<00:00:32.279> is

00:00:32.389 --> 00:00:32.399 
pretty much cutting it in half this is

00:00:32.399 --> 00:00:33.380 
pretty much cutting it in half this is
the<00:00:32.489> rock<00:00:32.640> we're<00:00:32.820> going<00:00:32.910> to<00:00:32.969> use<00:00:33.149> as<00:00:33.300> the

00:00:33.380 --> 00:00:33.390 
the rock we're going to use as the

00:00:33.390 --> 00:00:35.840 
the rock we're going to use as the
blanker<00:00:34.020> that<00:00:34.739> stops<00:00:35.070> us<00:00:35.280> from<00:00:35.309> sliding<00:00:35.700> all

00:00:35.840 --> 00:00:35.850 
blanker that stops us from sliding all

00:00:35.850 --> 00:00:44.660 
blanker that stops us from sliding all
the<00:00:35.880> way<00:00:35.969> to<00:00:36.090> the<00:00:36.239> other<00:00:36.329> side<00:00:43.489> think<00:00:44.489> about

00:00:44.660 --> 00:00:44.670 
the way to the other side think about

00:00:44.670 --> 00:00:47.170 
the way to the other side think about
all<00:00:45.059> the<00:00:45.239> stuff<00:00:45.270> that<00:00:45.690> can<00:00:45.780> go<00:00:45.960> wrong

00:00:47.170 --> 00:00:47.180 
all the stuff that can go wrong

00:00:47.180 --> 00:00:49.459 
all the stuff that can go wrong
floppy<00:00:48.180> viral<00:00:48.450> stuff<00:00:48.629> you<00:00:48.750> can<00:00:48.899> go<00:00:49.020> right<00:00:49.200> I

00:00:49.459 --> 00:00:49.469 
floppy viral stuff you can go right I
