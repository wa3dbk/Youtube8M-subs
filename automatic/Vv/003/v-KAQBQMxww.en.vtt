visually<00:01:31.450> dull<00:01:31.660> the<00:01:32.350> head<00:01:32.500> sculpt<00:01:32.800> is

00:01:32.880 --> 00:01:32.890 
visually dull the head sculpt is

00:01:32.890 --> 00:01:34.950 
visually dull the head sculpt is
fantastic<00:01:33.490> too<00:01:33.670> the<00:01:34.030> silhouette<00:01:34.480> reminds<00:01:34.810> me

00:01:34.950 --> 00:01:34.960 
fantastic too the silhouette reminds me

00:01:34.960 --> 00:01:36.900 
fantastic too the silhouette reminds me
of<00:01:35.050> a<00:01:35.140> king's<00:01:35.350> crown<00:01:35.680> and<00:01:35.980> the<00:01:36.370> light<00:01:36.550> piping

00:01:40.650 --> 00:01:40.660 
face is a little bit of a letdown as

00:01:40.660 --> 00:01:42.900 
face is a little bit of a letdown as
Optimus<00:01:41.140> seems<00:01:41.350> to<00:01:41.530> carry<00:01:41.740> a<00:01:41.800> barbaric<00:01:42.370> run<00:01:42.610> I

Optimus seems to carry a barbaric run I

00:01:42.910 --> 00:01:44.430 
Optimus seems to carry a barbaric run I
would<00:01:43.330> have<00:01:43.450> much<00:01:43.600> preferred<00:01:43.630> a<00:01:44.020> face<00:01:44.170> plate

00:01:44.430 --> 00:01:44.440 
would have much preferred a face plate

00:01:44.440 --> 00:01:46.530 
would have much preferred a face plate

throughout the figure and this is the

00:01:48.040 --> 00:01:49.290 
throughout the figure and this is the
mode<00:01:48.190> where<00:01:48.400> panel<00:01:48.760> lining<00:01:49.090> would<00:01:49.180> have

00:01:51.270 --> 00:01:51.280 
benefitted the toy most though if I'm

benefitted the toy most though if I'm
honest<00:01:51.610> I<00:01:51.790> would<00:01:52.060> have<00:01:52.150> loved<00:01:52.420> to<00:01:52.450> see<00:01:52.570> Optimus

00:01:57.270 --> 00:01:57.280 
as for the other issues I have well it's

00:01:57.280 --> 00:01:58.980 
as for the other issues I have well it's
a<00:01:57.400> little<00:01:57.580> tough<00:01:57.850> not<00:01:58.060> to<00:01:58.240> ignore<00:01:58.360> that<00:01:58.630> giant

that this figure isn't quite the best

neck swivel which is you know it's

joint to make him look upwards but then

00:02:45.189 --> 00:02:47.550 
joint to make him look upwards but then
you<00:02:45.280> have<00:02:45.400> a<00:02:45.430> sort<00:02:46.090> of<00:02:46.150> gap<00:02:46.329> there<00:02:46.599> the

you have a sort of gap there the

the<00:02:53.409> only<00:02:53.829> problem<00:02:54.250> is<00:02:54.310> this<00:02:54.519> grey<00:02:54.849> section

00:02:55.199 --> 00:02:55.209 
the only problem is this grey section

00:02:55.209 --> 00:02:57.449 
the only problem is this grey section
here<00:02:55.510> where<00:02:55.690> it<00:02:55.810> connects<00:02:56.139> on<00:02:56.319> is<00:02:56.530> very<00:02:57.190> weak

00:02:57.449 --> 00:02:57.459 
here where it connects on is very weak

00:02:57.459 --> 00:02:59.309 
here where it connects on is very weak
so<00:02:57.700> sometimes<00:02:58.090> they'll<00:02:58.329> just<00:02:58.359> simply<00:02:58.870> pop<00:02:59.079> out

00:02:59.309 --> 00:02:59.319 
so sometimes they'll just simply pop out

00:02:59.319 --> 00:03:02.039 
so sometimes they'll just simply pop out

00:03:09.300 --> 00:03:09.310 
these bits can just pop right off if you

00:03:09.310 --> 00:03:11.699 
these bits can just pop right off if you
don't<00:03:09.459> like<00:03:09.579> them<00:03:10.260> now<00:03:11.260> when<00:03:11.409> you're<00:03:11.500> moving

00:03:11.699 --> 00:03:11.709

the way so you have to sometimes move
them<00:03:15.760> out<00:03:15.909> and<00:03:16.109> then<00:03:17.109> put<00:03:17.620> them<00:03:17.739> back<00:03:17.769> into

00:03:18.059 --> 00:03:18.069 
them out and then put them back into

00:03:18.069 --> 00:03:20.550 
them out and then put them back into
place<00:03:18.370> which<00:03:18.699> is<00:03:18.879> kind<00:03:19.299> of<00:03:19.389> annoying<00:03:19.660> but<00:03:20.440> you

00:03:23.159 --> 00:03:23.169 
option there as opposed to just being

00:03:23.169 --> 00:03:24.930 
option there as opposed to just being
hindered<00:03:23.620> in<00:03:23.769> articulation<00:03:24.400> from<00:03:24.519> the<00:03:24.699> start

00:03:47.069 --> 00:03:47.079 
kind of sucks there is a risk swivel and

00:03:47.079 --> 00:03:50.009 
kind of sucks there is a risk swivel and
it's<00:03:47.530> a<00:03:47.799> simple<00:03:48.069> swivel<00:03:48.579> not<00:03:48.970> really<00:03:49.209> there<00:03:49.389> to

00:03:50.009 --> 00:03:50.019 
it's a simple swivel not really there to

00:03:50.019 --> 00:03:52.379 
it's a simple swivel not really there to
do<00:03:50.139> much<00:03:50.549> despite<00:03:51.549> looking<00:03:51.819> like<00:03:51.940> a<00:03:52.030> house<00:03:52.180> 1

00:03:52.379 --> 00:03:52.389 
do much despite looking like a house 1

00:03:52.389 --> 00:03:54.000 
do much despite looking like a house 1
there<00:03:52.540> is<00:03:52.569> no<00:03:53.019> waist<00:03:53.290> soul<00:03:53.500> and<00:03:53.709> I<00:03:53.739> can't

00:03:54.000 --> 00:03:54.010 
there is no waist soul and I can't

00:03:54.010 --> 00:03:55.949 
there is no waist soul and I can't
figure<00:03:54.159> out<00:03:54.280> why<00:03:54.489> not<00:03:54.699> I<00:03:54.729> mean<00:03:55.000> sure<00:03:55.750> these

00:03:55.949 --> 00:03:55.959 
figure out why not I mean sure these

00:03:55.959 --> 00:03:57.409 
figure out why not I mean sure these
bits<00:03:56.229> would<00:03:56.319> have<00:03:56.470> gotten<00:03:56.620> in<00:03:56.829> the<00:03:56.919> way<00:03:57.040> but

00:03:57.409 --> 00:03:57.419 
bits would have gotten in the way but

00:03:57.419 --> 00:04:00.270 
bits would have gotten in the way but
for<00:03:58.419> the<00:03:58.510> most<00:03:58.690> part<00:03:58.840> I<00:03:59.409> think<00:03:59.590> he<00:04:00.010> could<00:04:00.159> have

00:04:00.270 --> 00:04:00.280 
for the most part I think he could have

00:04:00.280 --> 00:04:03.420 
for the most part I think he could have
made<00:04:00.370> with<00:04:00.549> one<00:04:01.680> the<00:04:02.680> hips<00:04:02.889> themselves<00:04:03.310> are

00:04:03.420 --> 00:04:03.430 
made with one the hips themselves are

00:04:03.430 --> 00:04:05.129 
made with one the hips themselves are
pretty<00:04:03.609> nice<00:04:03.790> there's<00:04:04.060> a<00:04:04.120> nice<00:04:04.269> outward<00:04:04.750> range

00:04:05.129 --> 00:04:05.139 
pretty nice there's a nice outward range

00:04:05.139 --> 00:04:07.740 
pretty nice there's a nice outward range
there<00:04:05.560> no<00:04:06.190> ratchet<00:04:06.609> so<00:04:06.760> you<00:04:06.849> can<00:04:07.030> really<00:04:07.269> you

00:04:07.740 --> 00:04:07.750 
there no ratchet so you can really you

00:04:07.750 --> 00:04:09.119 
there no ratchet so you can really you
know<00:04:07.870> pull<00:04:08.169> it<00:04:08.290> out<00:04:08.379> anywhere<00:04:08.650> you<00:04:08.769> want<00:04:08.979> and

00:04:09.119 --> 00:04:09.129

know pull it out anywhere you want and
there's<00:04:09.250> a<00:04:09.340> good<00:04:09.459> swivel<00:04:10.389> back<00:04:10.569> and<00:04:10.780> forth<00:04:11.069> the

00:04:12.059 --> 00:04:12.069 
there's a good swivel back and forth the

00:04:12.069 --> 00:04:13.409 
there's a good swivel back and forth the
only<00:04:12.220> issue<00:04:12.340> is<00:04:12.459> sometimes<00:04:12.940> they<00:04:13.239> are<00:04:13.389> a

00:04:13.409 --> 00:04:13.419 
only issue is sometimes they are a

00:04:13.419 --> 00:04:15.689 
only issue is sometimes they are a
little<00:04:13.449> weak<00:04:13.780> this<00:04:14.470> one<00:04:14.620> presence<00:04:14.979> online<00:04:15.280> is

00:04:15.689 --> 00:04:15.699 
little weak this one presence online is

00:04:15.699 --> 00:04:19.620 
little weak this one presence online is
you<00:04:16.449> know<00:04:16.919> it's<00:04:17.919> not<00:04:18.039> very<00:04:18.220> secure<00:04:18.630> ratcheted

00:04:19.620 --> 00:04:19.630 
you know it's not very secure ratcheted

00:04:19.630 --> 00:04:22.170 
you know it's not very secure ratcheted
knee<00:04:19.780> which<00:04:20.019> is<00:04:20.169> really<00:04:20.799> cool<00:04:20.979> and<00:04:21.340> of<00:04:21.880> course

00:04:22.170 --> 00:04:22.180 
knee which is really cool and of course

00:04:22.180 --> 00:04:26.279 
knee which is really cool and of course
the<00:04:22.690> foot<00:04:23.080> can<00:04:23.320> bend<00:04:23.969> downwards<00:04:24.969> and<00:04:25.270> I<00:04:26.110> have

00:04:26.279 --> 00:04:26.289 
the foot can bend downwards and I have

00:04:26.289 --> 00:04:27.750 
the foot can bend downwards and I have
no<00:04:26.440> idea<00:04:27.159> why

00:04:27.750 --> 00:04:27.760 
no idea why

00:04:27.760 --> 00:04:30.150 
no idea why
only<00:04:27.970> bends<00:04:28.150> downwards<00:04:28.660> because<00:04:28.840> in<00:04:29.470> an

00:04:30.150 --> 00:04:30.160 
only bends downwards because in an

00:04:30.160 --> 00:04:32.250 
only bends downwards because in an
assault<00:04:30.850> mode<00:04:31.060> these<00:04:31.210> are<00:04:31.390> kind<00:04:31.780> of<00:04:31.900> left

00:04:32.250 --> 00:04:32.260 
assault mode these are kind of left

00:04:32.260 --> 00:04:33.630 
assault mode these are kind of left
where<00:04:32.500> they<00:04:32.590> are<00:04:32.710> so<00:04:32.890> there's<00:04:33.040> no<00:04:33.220> reason<00:04:33.610> for

00:04:33.630 --> 00:04:33.640 
where they are so there's no reason for

00:04:33.640 --> 00:04:35.700 
where they are so there's no reason for
this<00:04:33.820> to<00:04:33.970> pen<00:04:34.090> downwards<00:04:34.540> and<00:04:34.780> it<00:04:35.170> sucks<00:04:35.470> to

00:04:35.700 --> 00:04:35.710 
this to pen downwards and it sucks to

00:04:35.710 --> 00:04:37.410 
this to pen downwards and it sucks to
because<00:04:36.130> I<00:04:36.310> wish<00:04:36.700> you<00:04:36.910> could<00:04:37.060> mend<00:04:37.270> them

00:04:37.410 --> 00:04:37.420 
because I wish you could mend them

00:04:37.420 --> 00:04:39.480 
because I wish you could mend them
forwards<00:04:37.960> or<00:04:38.200> at<00:04:38.560> least<00:04:38.800> an<00:04:38.950> ankle<00:04:39.250> rocker

00:04:39.480 --> 00:04:39.490 
forwards or at least an ankle rocker

00:04:39.490 --> 00:04:41.250 
forwards or at least an ankle rocker
because<00:04:39.730> he<00:04:40.330> can<00:04:40.480> assume<00:04:40.810> wide<00:04:41.050> legged

00:04:41.250 --> 00:04:41.260 
because he can assume wide legged

00:04:41.260 --> 00:04:43.500 
because he can assume wide legged
stances<00:04:41.770> it's<00:04:41.950> just<00:04:42.280> his<00:04:42.880> feet<00:04:43.090> won't<00:04:43.270> lay

00:04:43.500 --> 00:04:43.510 
stances it's just his feet won't lay
