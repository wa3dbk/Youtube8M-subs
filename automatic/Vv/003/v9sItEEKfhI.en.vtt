00:00:46.259 --> 00:00:46.269 
bolts holding on the front rotor this is

00:00:46.269 --> 00:00:49.280 
bolts holding on the front rotor this is
an<00:00:46.360> aftermarket<00:00:46.829> rotor<00:00:47.829> from<00:00:48.159> braking<00:00:48.640> and

an aftermarket rotor from braking and
this<00:00:50.290> is<00:00:50.589> held<00:00:50.799> on<00:00:50.949> by<00:00:51.159> titanium<00:00:51.549> bolts<00:00:52.030> here

00:00:52.200 --> 00:00:52.210 
this is held on by titanium bolts here

00:00:52.210 --> 00:00:55.380 
this is held on by titanium bolts here
and<00:00:52.390> that<00:00:52.600> is<00:00:52.809> an<00:00:53.019> aluminum<00:00:54.119> banjo<00:00:55.119> bolt

00:00:55.380 --> 00:00:55.390 
and that is an aluminum banjo bolt

00:00:55.390 --> 00:00:57.899 
and that is an aluminum banjo bolt
holding<00:00:55.989> on<00:00:56.110> the<00:00:56.229> brakes<00:00:56.470> and<00:00:56.710> this<00:00:56.890> brake<00:00:57.640> was

00:00:57.899 --> 00:00:57.909 
holding on the brakes and this brake was

00:00:57.909 --> 00:00:59.490 
holding on the brakes and this brake was
a<00:00:57.940> manufactured<00:00:58.720> by<00:00:58.839> an<00:00:58.900> aircraft<00:00:59.080> company

00:00:59.490 --> 00:00:59.500 
a manufactured by an aircraft company

00:00:59.500 --> 00:01:03.810 
a manufactured by an aircraft company
also<00:01:00.280> the<00:01:00.430> offset<00:01:01.000> on<00:01:01.390> the<00:01:02.220> caliper<00:01:03.220> for<00:01:03.729> the

00:01:03.810 --> 00:01:03.820 
also the offset on the caliper for the

also the offset on the caliper for the
front<00:01:04.089> has<00:01:04.299> been<00:01:04.330> machined<00:01:04.689> 50<00:01:05.379> thousandths

00:01:05.969 --> 00:01:05.979 
front has been machined 50 thousandths

00:01:05.979 --> 00:01:08.280 
front has been machined 50 thousandths
because<00:01:06.760> these<00:01:06.909> are<00:01:07.090> Honda<00:01:07.570> front<00:01:07.840> forks

00:01:08.280 --> 00:01:08.290 
because these are Honda front forks

00:01:08.290 --> 00:01:10.679 
because these are Honda front forks
which<00:01:09.189> have<00:01:09.369> titanium<00:01:09.729> top<00:01:10.090> out<00:01:10.299> Springs

which have titanium top out Springs
aluminum<00:01:11.080> dampeners<00:01:11.590> as<00:01:11.770> well<00:01:12.010> the<00:01:12.760> Honda

00:01:13.140 --> 00:01:13.150 
aluminum dampeners as well the Honda

00:01:13.150 --> 00:01:16.440 
aluminum dampeners as well the Honda
forks<00:01:13.659> are<00:01:13.869> half<00:01:14.290> an<00:01:14.530> inch<00:01:14.680> wider<00:01:15.070> on<00:01:15.520> the

00:01:16.440 --> 00:01:16.450 
forks are half an inch wider on the

00:01:16.450 --> 00:01:19.740 
forks are half an inch wider on the
stanchions<00:01:17.140> than<00:01:17.470> the<00:01:18.220> KTM<00:01:19.150> and<00:01:19.180> I<00:01:19.420> wanted<00:01:19.689> to

00:01:19.740 --> 00:01:19.750 
stanchions than the KTM and I wanted to

00:01:19.750 --> 00:01:21.360 
stanchions than the KTM and I wanted to
run<00:01:19.900> the<00:01:20.080> KTM<00:01:20.770> triple<00:01:21.070> clamps<00:01:21.310> because

00:01:21.360 --> 00:01:21.370 
run the KTM triple clamps because

00:01:21.370 --> 00:01:23.190 
run the KTM triple clamps because
they're<00:01:21.580> extremely<00:01:22.090> light<00:01:22.510> so<00:01:22.750> I<00:01:22.780> had<00:01:23.020> this

00:01:23.190 --> 00:01:23.200 
they're extremely light so I had this

00:01:23.200 --> 00:01:25.890 
they're extremely light so I had this
board<00:01:23.560> 40,000<00:01:24.460> saw<00:01:24.580> the<00:01:24.640> diameter<00:01:25.180> 20,000<00:01:25.840> so

00:01:25.890 --> 00:01:25.900 
board 40,000 saw the diameter 20,000 so

00:01:25.900 --> 00:01:27.000 
board 40,000 saw the diameter 20,000 so
on<00:01:25.960> the<00:01:26.020> radius<00:01:26.350> gonna<00:01:26.530> had<00:01:26.650> to<00:01:26.740> show<00:01:26.890> them

00:01:27.000 --> 00:01:27.010 
on the radius gonna had to show them
