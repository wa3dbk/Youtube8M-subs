00:01:46.780 --> 00:01:46.790 
kind of funny the Galaxy Notes screen

00:01:46.790 --> 00:01:49.370 
kind of funny the Galaxy Notes screen
it's<00:01:47.790> much<00:01:48.090> smaller<00:01:48.329> than<00:01:48.570> the<00:01:48.689> iPad<00:01:48.990> Mini<00:01:49.200> but

00:01:49.370 --> 00:01:49.380 
it's much smaller than the iPad Mini but

00:01:49.380 --> 00:01:51.469 
it's much smaller than the iPad Mini but
it's<00:01:49.590> just<00:01:49.770> such<00:01:49.979> a<00:01:50.009> big<00:01:50.250> screen<00:01:50.520> so<00:01:51.060> here<00:01:51.270> they

00:01:51.469 --> 00:01:51.479 
it's just such a big screen so here they

00:01:51.479 --> 00:01:53.330 
it's just such a big screen so here they
are<00:01:51.630> compared<00:01:52.140> and<00:01:52.320> we'll<00:01:52.470> put<00:01:53.040> them<00:01:53.159> up

00:01:53.330 --> 00:01:53.340 
are compared and we'll put them up

00:01:53.340 --> 00:01:56.020 
are compared and we'll put them up
against<00:01:53.939> each<00:01:54.060> other<00:01:54.210> in<00:01:54.479> terms<00:01:54.689> of<00:01:54.990> thickness

00:01:56.020 --> 00:01:56.030 
against each other in terms of thickness

00:01:56.030 --> 00:01:58.940 
against each other in terms of thickness
so<00:01:57.030> the<00:01:57.210> Galaxy<00:01:57.360> Note<00:01:58.259> 2<00:01:58.320> is<00:01:58.680> definitely

00:01:58.940 --> 00:01:58.950 
so the Galaxy Note 2 is definitely

00:01:58.950 --> 00:02:00.920 
so the Galaxy Note 2 is definitely
thicker<00:01:59.460> than<00:01:59.820> the<00:01:59.909> iPad<00:02:00.210> Mini<00:02:00.360> nothing<00:02:00.719> that

00:02:00.920 --> 00:02:00.930 
thicker than the iPad Mini nothing that

00:02:00.930 --> 00:02:03.560 
thicker than the iPad Mini nothing that
I<00:02:00.960> have<00:02:01.290> in<00:02:01.619> terms<00:02:01.799> of<00:02:02.040> gadgets<00:02:02.520> here<00:02:03.090> is

00:02:03.560 --> 00:02:03.570 
I have in terms of gadgets here is

00:02:03.570 --> 00:02:05.800 
I have in terms of gadgets here is
thinner<00:02:04.200> than<00:02:04.380> the<00:02:04.500> iPad<00:02:04.770> Mini<00:02:04.920> it's<00:02:05.399> the<00:02:05.520> LG

thinner than the iPad Mini it's the LG
Optimus<00:02:06.810> G<00:02:07.610> kind<00:02:08.610> of<00:02:08.759> a<00:02:08.989> similar<00:02:09.989> device<00:02:10.259> to

00:02:10.400 --> 00:02:10.410 
Optimus G kind of a similar device to

00:02:10.410 --> 00:02:12.740 
Optimus G kind of a similar device to
the<00:02:10.530> Nexus<00:02:10.890> 4<00:02:11.129> that's<00:02:11.370> on<00:02:11.580> its<00:02:11.730> way<00:02:11.819> out

the Nexus 4 that's on its way out

00:02:12.750 --> 00:02:14.510 
the Nexus 4 that's on its way out
can<00:02:12.870> get<00:02:13.200> a<00:02:13.230> sense<00:02:13.500> they're<00:02:13.770> the<00:02:14.100> adoptive

00:02:14.510 --> 00:02:14.520 
can get a sense they're the adoptive

00:02:14.520 --> 00:02:17.140 
can get a sense they're the adoptive
she's<00:02:14.760> so<00:02:15.030> thin<00:02:15.300> but<00:02:15.870> again<00:02:16.080> the<00:02:16.260> iPad<00:02:16.590> Mini<00:02:16.830> is

00:02:17.140 --> 00:02:17.150

00:02:21.530 --> 00:02:21.540 
just thinner let's see next to a compact

00:02:21.540 --> 00:02:23.660 
just thinner let's see next to a compact
disc<00:02:21.900> remember<00:02:22.260> those<00:02:22.440> yeah<00:02:22.890> I<00:02:23.160> don't<00:02:23.220> either

00:02:23.660 --> 00:02:23.670 
disc remember those yeah I don't either

00:02:23.670 --> 00:02:25.940 
disc remember those yeah I don't either
well<00:02:23.970> they<00:02:24.480> still<00:02:24.690> have<00:02:24.840> those<00:02:24.990> so<00:02:25.500> about<00:02:25.740> the

00:02:25.940 --> 00:02:25.950 
well they still have those so about the

00:02:25.950 --> 00:02:28.160 
well they still have those so about the
size<00:02:26.160> of<00:02:26.280> a<00:02:26.340> compact<00:02:26.730> disc<00:02:27.000> in<00:02:27.180> terms<00:02:27.450> of<00:02:27.630> width

00:02:28.160 --> 00:02:28.170 
size of a compact disc in terms of width

00:02:28.170 --> 00:02:29.780 
size of a compact disc in terms of width
definitely<00:02:28.800> not<00:02:28.920> in<00:02:29.040> terms<00:02:29.160> of<00:02:29.400> height<00:02:29.550> oh

00:02:29.780 --> 00:02:29.790 
definitely not in terms of height oh

00:02:29.790 --> 00:02:32.330 
definitely not in terms of height oh
look<00:02:30.390> the<00:02:30.540> compact<00:02:30.900> disc<00:02:31.050> is<00:02:31.380> thinner<00:02:31.709> than

00:02:32.330 --> 00:02:32.340 
look the compact disc is thinner than

00:02:32.340 --> 00:02:34.520 
look the compact disc is thinner than
the<00:02:32.490> iPad<00:02:32.880> Mini<00:02:33.090> we<00:02:33.270> have<00:02:33.420> a<00:02:33.450> winner<00:02:33.660> and<00:02:33.930> let's

00:02:34.520 --> 00:02:34.530 
the iPad Mini we have a winner and let's

00:02:34.530 --> 00:02:37.850 
the iPad Mini we have a winner and let's
see<00:02:34.650> anything<00:02:34.800> else<00:02:35.220> we've<00:02:35.640> got<00:02:35.880> a<00:02:36.860> pencil

00:02:37.850 --> 00:02:37.860 
see anything else we've got a pencil

00:02:37.860 --> 00:02:40.430 
see anything else we've got a pencil
right<00:02:38.160> so<00:02:38.730> apparently<00:02:39.420> the<00:02:39.630> iPad<00:02:40.050> Mini<00:02:40.260> is<00:02:40.380> the

00:02:40.430 --> 00:02:40.440 
right so apparently the iPad Mini is the

00:02:40.440 --> 00:02:43.520 
right so apparently the iPad Mini is the
same<00:02:40.620> width<00:02:40.800> as<00:02:41.130> a<00:02:41.160> pencil<00:02:41.550> and<00:02:41.760> yeah<00:02:42.720> I'd<00:02:43.080> say

00:02:43.520 --> 00:02:43.530 
same width as a pencil and yeah I'd say

00:02:43.530 --> 00:02:44.810 
same width as a pencil and yeah I'd say
that<00:02:43.560> is<00:02:44.130> accurate

00:02:44.810 --> 00:02:44.820 
that is accurate

00:02:44.820 --> 00:02:48.190 
that is accurate
super<00:02:45.450> thin<00:02:45.720> pencil<00:02:46.650> like<00:02:47.070> got<00:02:47.730> a<00:02:47.760> good<00:02:48.000> old

yo-yo<00:02:52.440> I<00:02:52.950> don't<00:02:53.190> know<00:02:53.280> why<00:02:53.459> I<00:02:53.700> brought<00:02:53.790> the

00:02:53.990 --> 00:02:54.000 
yo-yo I don't know why I brought the

00:02:54.000 --> 00:02:56.150 
yo-yo I don't know why I brought the
yo-yo<00:02:54.300> out<00:02:54.450> there's<00:02:54.870> the<00:02:55.350> iPad<00:02:55.650> Mini<00:02:55.830> next<00:02:56.070> to

00:02:57.890 --> 00:02:57.900 
a yo-yo and that should give you a

00:02:57.900 --> 00:03:00.470 
a yo-yo and that should give you a
pretty<00:02:58.140> good<00:02:58.350> idea<00:02:58.459> to<00:02:59.459> the<00:02:59.580> size<00:02:59.850> of<00:03:00.030> the<00:03:00.090> iPad
