this little trap catches a lot of people
that<00:03:10.680> this<00:03:11.680> part<00:03:12.160> doesn't<00:03:13.120> look<00:03:13.360> like<00:03:13.510> the

00:03:13.620 --> 00:03:13.630 
that this part doesn't look like the

00:03:13.630 --> 00:03:14.820 
that this part doesn't look like the
warthog<00:03:13.960> would<00:03:14.140> fit<00:03:14.350> but<00:03:14.560> it's<00:03:14.680> actually

00:03:14.820 --> 00:03:14.830 
warthog would fit but it's actually

00:03:14.830 --> 00:03:16.860 
warthog would fit but it's actually
easier<00:03:15.640> to<00:03:15.820> drive<00:03:16.030> the<00:03:16.240> work<00:03:16.420> out<00:03:16.600> through

00:03:16.860 --> 00:03:16.870 
easier to drive the work out through

00:03:16.870 --> 00:03:18.330 
easier to drive the work out through
here<00:03:17.020> than<00:03:17.200> it<00:03:17.290> is<00:03:17.410> to<00:03:17.590> drive<00:03:17.710> the<00:03:17.950> Mongoose

00:03:18.330 --> 00:03:18.340 
here than it is to drive the Mongoose
