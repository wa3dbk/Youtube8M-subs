extremely significant important
discovery<00:02:30.109> and<00:02:30.290> I've<00:02:30.680> allowed<00:02:31.010> lighting<00:02:31.489> to

00:02:31.539 --> 00:02:31.549 
discovery and I've allowed lighting to

00:02:31.549 --> 00:02:34.360 
discovery and I've allowed lighting to
make<00:02:31.730> some<00:02:32.000> interesting<00:02:32.930> new<00:02:33.370> speculations

00:02:34.360 --> 00:02:34.370 
make some interesting new speculations

00:02:34.370 --> 00:02:36.490 
make some interesting new speculations

00:02:39.550 --> 00:02:39.560 
dinosaurs so this is where we get our
