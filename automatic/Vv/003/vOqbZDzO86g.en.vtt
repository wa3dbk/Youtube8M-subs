00:00:09.129 --> 00:00:09.139 
that I started this Arduino project

00:00:09.139 --> 00:00:11.979 
that I started this Arduino project
involves<00:00:09.559> using<00:00:09.769> serial<00:00:10.369> communication<00:00:11.209> so

00:00:11.979 --> 00:00:11.989 
involves using serial communication so

00:00:11.989 --> 00:00:13.239 
involves using serial communication so
I'm<00:00:12.079> basically<00:00:12.230> going<00:00:12.469> to<00:00:12.650> be<00:00:12.799> controlling

00:00:38.170 --> 00:00:38.180 
the basics all the way up until some

00:00:38.180 --> 00:00:41.529 
the basics all the way up until some
pretty<00:00:38.390> advanced<00:00:39.289> stuff<00:00:39.949> and<00:00:40.219> this<00:00:41.120> is<00:00:41.329> one<00:00:41.510> of

00:00:41.529 --> 00:00:41.539 
pretty advanced stuff and this is one of

00:00:41.539 --> 00:00:44.170 
pretty advanced stuff and this is one of
his<00:00:41.780> tutorials<00:00:42.350> he<00:00:42.680> was<00:00:42.859> using<00:00:43.039> a<00:00:43.280> single<00:00:43.820> led

00:00:44.170 --> 00:00:44.180 
his tutorials he was using a single led

00:00:44.180 --> 00:00:45.729 
his tutorials he was using a single led
to<00:00:44.449> cut<00:00:44.660> on<00:00:44.809> and<00:00:44.960> off<00:00:45.079> and<00:00:45.289> I<00:00:45.320> went<00:00:45.440> ahead<00:00:45.590> and

00:00:45.729 --> 00:00:45.739 
to cut on and off and I went ahead and

00:00:45.739 --> 00:00:50.590 
to cut on and off and I went ahead and
just<00:00:47.500> added<00:00:48.500> four<00:00:48.710> more<00:00:48.739> LEDs<00:00:49.100> and<00:00:49.730> messed

00:00:50.590 --> 00:00:50.600 
just added four more LEDs and messed

00:00:50.600 --> 00:00:51.700 
just added four more LEDs and messed
with<00:00:50.660> the<00:00:50.840> code<00:00:50.989> a<00:00:51.019> little<00:00:51.350> bit<00:00:51.469> to<00:00:51.620> get

00:00:51.700 --> 00:00:51.710 
with the code a little bit to get

00:00:51.710 --> 00:00:54.069 
with the code a little bit to get
everything<00:00:51.949> to<00:00:52.219> work<00:00:52.340> correctly<00:00:52.910> so<00:00:53.899> I'm

00:00:54.069 --> 00:00:54.079 
everything to work correctly so I'm

00:00:54.079 --> 00:00:55.330 
everything to work correctly so I'm
going<00:00:54.199> to<00:00:54.230> go<00:00:54.350> ahead<00:00:54.500> and<00:00:54.620> show<00:00:54.769> you<00:00:54.829> how<00:00:55.100> to<00:00:55.129> do

and two will turn on the last one and

00:01:08.990 --> 00:01:11.800 
and two will turn on the last one and
then<00:01:09.980> to<00:01:10.130> turn<00:01:10.310> them<00:01:10.490> off<00:01:10.640> I<00:01:10.910> just<00:01:10.940> use<00:01:11.420> the<00:01:11.600> key

00:01:11.800 --> 00:01:11.810 
then to turn them off I just use the key

00:01:11.810 --> 00:01:14.140 
then to turn them off I just use the key
next<00:01:12.230> to<00:01:12.470> it<00:01:12.680> three<00:01:13.580> will<00:01:13.730> turn<00:01:13.880> the<00:01:14.000> one<00:01:14.120> I

00:01:14.140 --> 00:01:14.150 
next to it three will turn the one I

00:01:14.150 --> 00:01:16.450 
next to it three will turn the one I
just<00:01:14.390> turned<00:01:14.540> on/off<00:01:14.950> five<00:01:15.950> will<00:01:16.190> turn<00:01:16.340> the

00:01:16.450 --> 00:01:16.460 
just turned on/off five will turn the

00:01:16.460 --> 00:01:20.040 
just turned on/off five will turn the
next<00:01:16.700> one<00:01:16.850> then<00:01:17.150> eight<00:01:17.480> and<00:01:17.860> then<00:01:18.860> zero<00:01:19.580> and

00:01:20.040 --> 00:01:20.050 
next one then eight and then zero and

00:01:20.050 --> 00:01:22.000 
next one then eight and then zero and
basically<00:01:21.050> what's<00:01:21.260> happening<00:01:21.680> here<00:01:21.920> it's

00:01:22.000 --> 00:01:22.010 
basically what's happening here it's

00:01:22.010 --> 00:01:23.980 
basically what's happening here it's
it's<00:01:22.280> communicating<00:01:23.240> over<00:01:23.450> the<00:01:23.540> serial

00:01:23.980 --> 00:01:23.990 
it's communicating over the serial

00:01:23.990 --> 00:01:27.970 
it's communicating over the serial
connection<00:01:24.400> and<00:01:25.400> if<00:01:26.170> you're<00:01:27.170> familiar<00:01:27.650> with

00:01:27.970 --> 00:01:27.980 
connection and if you're familiar with

00:01:27.980 --> 00:01:30.790 
connection and if you're familiar with
putty<00:01:28.780> suggest<00:01:29.780> you<00:01:29.870> download<00:01:30.020> putty<00:01:30.500> and

00:01:30.790 --> 00:01:30.800 
putty suggest you download putty and

00:01:30.800 --> 00:01:32.740 
putty suggest you download putty and
this<00:01:31.640> is<00:01:31.730> how<00:01:31.850> you're<00:01:32.000> communicating<00:01:32.120> with<00:01:32.600> it

00:01:32.740 --> 00:01:32.750 
this is how you're communicating with it

00:01:32.750 --> 00:01:35.380 
this is how you're communicating with it
whenever<00:01:32.870> I<00:01:33.050> press<00:01:33.320> the<00:01:33.530> numbers<00:01:33.970> it<00:01:34.970> does

00:01:35.380 --> 00:01:35.390 
whenever I press the numbers it does

00:01:35.390 --> 00:01:39.550 
whenever I press the numbers it does
tell<00:01:36.320> me<00:01:36.440> that<00:01:37.370> when<00:01:37.940> the<00:01:38.060> LED<00:01:38.420> is<00:01:38.600> on<00:01:38.900> or<00:01:39.320> when

00:01:39.550 --> 00:01:39.560 
tell me that when the LED is on or when

00:01:39.560 --> 00:01:42.220 
tell me that when the LED is on or when
the<00:01:39.680> LEDs<00:01:40.010> off<00:01:40.250> so<00:01:41.150> when<00:01:41.600> I<00:01:41.630> go<00:01:41.810> to<00:01:41.870> turn<00:01:42.080> my

00:01:42.220 --> 00:01:42.230 
the LEDs off so when I go to turn my

00:01:42.230 --> 00:01:46.900 
the LEDs off so when I go to turn my
LEDs<00:01:42.440> on<00:01:43.780> listed<00:01:44.780> their<00:01:44.930> LEDs<00:01:45.410> on<00:01:45.560> LED<00:01:46.040> on<00:01:46.280> LED

00:01:46.900 --> 00:01:46.910 
LEDs on listed their LEDs on LED on LED

00:01:46.910 --> 00:01:51.490 
LEDs on listed their LEDs on LED on LED
on<00:01:47.060> and<00:01:47.330> then<00:01:48.140> when<00:01:48.380> I<00:01:48.410> go<00:01:48.590> to<00:01:48.650> cut<00:01:48.860> them<00:01:48.950> off<00:01:50.500> it

00:01:51.490 --> 00:01:51.500 
on and then when I go to cut them off it

00:01:51.500 --> 00:01:55.469 
on and then when I go to cut them off it
shows<00:01:51.830> that<00:01:51.980> it's<00:01:52.160> off

00:01:55.469 --> 00:01:55.479 

00:01:55.479 --> 00:01:57.660 

so<00:01:56.140> that's<00:01:56.619> really<00:01:56.799> it<00:01:57.070> it's<00:01:57.310> really<00:01:57.549> easy

00:01:57.660 --> 00:01:57.670 
so that's really it it's really easy

00:01:57.670 --> 00:02:00.840 
so that's really it it's really easy
