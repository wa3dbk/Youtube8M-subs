I'm<00:00:05.700> here<00:00:06.000> at<00:00:06.089> Wake<00:00:06.270> Forest<00:00:06.299> University<00:00:06.740> one

00:00:07.730 --> 00:00:07.740 
I'm here at Wake Forest University one

00:00:07.740 --> 00:00:09.530 
I'm here at Wake Forest University one
of<00:00:07.770> the<00:00:07.890> mecca's<00:00:08.519> of<00:00:08.670> tissue<00:00:08.970> regeneration

00:00:09.530 --> 00:00:09.540 
of the mecca's of tissue regeneration

00:00:09.540 --> 00:00:11.749 
of the mecca's of tissue regeneration
these<00:00:10.110> are<00:00:10.230> technologies<00:00:10.530> that<00:00:10.800> fascinate<00:00:11.610> me

00:00:11.749 --> 00:00:11.759 
these are technologies that fascinate me

00:00:11.759 --> 00:00:13.730 
these are technologies that fascinate me
because<00:00:12.090> they<00:00:12.179> could<00:00:12.330> add<00:00:12.509> decades<00:00:13.139> to<00:00:13.620> our

00:00:13.730 --> 00:00:13.740 
because they could add decades to our

00:00:13.740 --> 00:00:19.359 
because they could add decades to our
life<00:00:13.980> let<00:00:14.370> me<00:00:14.429> take<00:00:14.580> a<00:00:14.610> look<00:00:14.759> inside

00:00:19.359 --> 00:00:19.369 

00:00:19.369 --> 00:00:21.590 

what<00:00:20.369> is<00:00:20.490> regenerative<00:00:20.880> medicine<00:00:21.240> mean

00:00:21.590 --> 00:00:21.600 
what is regenerative medicine mean

00:00:21.600 --> 00:00:24.800 
what is regenerative medicine mean
creating<00:00:22.439> cells<00:00:22.920> tissues<00:00:23.730> and<00:00:23.760> organs<00:00:24.029> for

00:00:24.800 --> 00:00:24.810 
creating cells tissues and organs for

00:00:24.810 --> 00:00:26.630 
creating cells tissues and organs for
patients<00:00:25.230> who<00:00:25.289> may<00:00:25.410> need<00:00:25.560> them<00:00:25.800> you<00:00:26.010> know<00:00:26.460> well

00:00:26.630 --> 00:00:26.640 
patients who may need them you know well

00:00:26.640 --> 00:00:28.849 
patients who may need them you know well
right<00:00:26.880> now<00:00:27.090> of<00:00:27.210> course<00:00:27.269> we<00:00:28.050> have<00:00:28.349> a<00:00:28.470> limited

00:00:28.849 --> 00:00:28.859 
right now of course we have a limited

00:00:28.859 --> 00:00:30.589 
right now of course we have a limited
lifespan<00:00:29.099> because<00:00:29.730> your<00:00:29.849> parts<00:00:30.150> are<00:00:30.240> breaking

00:00:30.589 --> 00:00:30.599 
lifespan because your parts are breaking

00:00:30.599 --> 00:00:33.260 
lifespan because your parts are breaking
down<00:00:30.830> but<00:00:31.830> imagine<00:00:32.399> a<00:00:32.520> time<00:00:32.820> in<00:00:33.149> the<00:00:33.239> future

00:00:33.260 --> 00:00:33.270 
down but imagine a time in the future

00:00:33.270 --> 00:00:36.260 
down but imagine a time in the future
when<00:00:34.020> once<00:00:34.950> those<00:00:35.190> parts<00:00:35.670> start<00:00:35.910> breaking

00:00:36.260 --> 00:00:36.270 
when once those parts start breaking

00:00:36.270 --> 00:00:38.990 
when once those parts start breaking
down<00:00:36.500> you<00:00:37.500> can<00:00:37.649> just<00:00:37.860> plug<00:00:38.129> a<00:00:38.399> new<00:00:38.640> one<00:00:38.790> right

00:00:38.990 --> 00:00:39.000 
down you can just plug a new one right

00:00:39.000 --> 00:00:42.319 
down you can just plug a new one right
in<00:00:39.770> dr.<00:00:40.770> Atala<00:00:41.010> and<00:00:41.340> his<00:00:41.460> team<00:00:41.700> have<00:00:42.090> grown

00:00:42.319 --> 00:00:42.329 
in dr. Atala and his team have grown

00:00:42.329 --> 00:00:44.660 
in dr. Atala and his team have grown
nearly<00:00:42.629> two<00:00:42.960> dozen<00:00:43.290> different<00:00:43.739> types<00:00:43.980> of<00:00:44.370> body

00:00:44.660 --> 00:00:44.670 
nearly two dozen different types of body

00:00:44.670 --> 00:00:47.779 
nearly two dozen different types of body
parts<00:00:45.120> including<00:00:45.899> muscle<00:00:46.140> bone<00:00:46.829> even<00:00:47.460> this

00:00:47.779 --> 00:00:47.789 
parts including muscle bone even this

00:00:47.789 --> 00:00:50.209 
parts including muscle bone even this
working<00:00:48.270> heart<00:00:48.510> valve<00:00:48.780> you<00:00:49.469> can<00:00:49.620> actually<00:00:49.770> see

00:00:50.209 --> 00:00:50.219 
working heart valve you can actually see

00:00:50.219 --> 00:00:52.130 
working heart valve you can actually see
it<00:00:50.309> pump<00:00:50.550> away<00:00:50.700> and<00:00:51.090> of<00:00:51.570> course<00:00:51.780> you<00:00:51.870> can<00:00:51.989> see

00:00:52.130 --> 00:00:52.140 
it pump away and of course you can see

00:00:52.140 --> 00:00:54.740 
it pump away and of course you can see
the<00:00:52.170> leaflets<00:00:52.649> from<00:00:52.770> above<00:00:53.129> open<00:00:54.030> up<00:00:54.329> close<00:00:54.570> I

00:00:54.740 --> 00:00:54.750 
the leaflets from above open up close I

00:00:54.750 --> 00:00:58.670 
the leaflets from above open up close I
could<00:00:54.989> use<00:00:55.199> this<00:00:56.809> that's<00:00:57.809> amazing<00:00:58.440> it's<00:00:58.590> a

00:00:58.670 --> 00:00:58.680 
could use this that's amazing it's a

00:00:58.680 --> 00:01:01.099 
could use this that's amazing it's a
real<00:00:58.859> valve<00:00:59.129> yeah<00:00:59.670> it's<00:01:00.000> a<00:01:00.059> real<00:01:00.210> valve<00:01:00.510> when

00:01:01.099 --> 00:01:01.109 
real valve yeah it's a real valve when

00:01:01.109 --> 00:01:02.869 
real valve yeah it's a real valve when
you<00:01:01.170> first<00:01:01.320> got<00:01:01.530> your<00:01:01.590> md<00:01:01.949> degree<00:01:02.070> did<00:01:02.789> you

00:01:02.869 --> 00:01:02.879 
you first got your md degree did you

00:01:02.879 --> 00:01:04.939 
you first got your md degree did you
ever<00:01:03.000> think<00:01:03.149> you'd<00:01:03.300> be<00:01:03.390> doing<00:01:03.600> this<00:01:03.719> no<00:01:04.350> is

00:01:04.939 --> 00:01:04.949 
ever think you'd be doing this no is

00:01:04.949 --> 00:01:06.320 
ever think you'd be doing this no is
this<00:01:05.100> the<00:01:05.580> stuff<00:01:05.790> that<00:01:05.939> we<00:01:06.030> thought<00:01:06.180> was

00:01:06.320 --> 00:01:06.330 
this the stuff that we thought was

00:01:06.330 --> 00:01:07.969 
this the stuff that we thought was
science<00:01:06.659> fiction<00:01:07.110> right<00:01:07.290> yeah<00:01:07.590> I<00:01:07.619> thought<00:01:07.890> it

00:01:07.969 --> 00:01:07.979 
science fiction right yeah I thought it

00:01:07.979 --> 00:01:10.789 
science fiction right yeah I thought it
was<00:01:08.070> I<00:01:08.220> walked<00:01:08.369> in<00:01:08.610> here<00:01:09.350> here's<00:01:10.350> how<00:01:10.500> he<00:01:10.560> does

00:01:10.789 --> 00:01:10.799 
was I walked in here here's how he does

00:01:10.799 --> 00:01:13.700 
was I walked in here here's how he does
it<00:01:10.979> first<00:01:11.610> a<00:01:11.790> mold<00:01:12.240> is<00:01:12.450> built<00:01:12.720> then<00:01:13.380> it's

00:01:13.700 --> 00:01:13.710 
it first a mold is built then it's

00:01:13.710 --> 00:01:16.820 
it first a mold is built then it's
seeded<00:01:14.340> with<00:01:14.549> live<00:01:14.850> cells<00:01:15.210> then<00:01:16.049> it<00:01:16.380> goes<00:01:16.590> into

00:01:16.820 --> 00:01:16.830 
seeded with live cells then it goes into

00:01:16.830 --> 00:01:19.249 
seeded with live cells then it goes into
an<00:01:17.040> incubator<00:01:17.490> where<00:01:18.090> the<00:01:18.330> cells<00:01:18.600> multiply

00:01:19.249 --> 00:01:19.259 
an incubator where the cells multiply

00:01:19.259 --> 00:01:21.679 
an incubator where the cells multiply
and<00:01:19.530> grow<00:01:19.770> this<00:01:20.759> actually<00:01:21.299> the<00:01:21.390> room<00:01:21.509> where<00:01:21.659> we

00:01:21.679 --> 00:01:21.689 
and grow this actually the room where we

00:01:21.689 --> 00:01:23.929 
and grow this actually the room where we
cook<00:01:22.080> the<00:01:22.259> organs<00:01:22.590> that<00:01:22.770> you<00:01:22.890> will<00:01:23.100> so<00:01:23.729> once

00:01:23.929 --> 00:01:23.939 
cook the organs that you will so once

00:01:23.939 --> 00:01:25.520 
cook the organs that you will so once
you're<00:01:24.119> made<00:01:24.420> we<00:01:24.750> actually<00:01:25.140> put<00:01:25.320> them<00:01:25.439> into

00:01:25.520 --> 00:01:25.530 
you're made we actually put them into

00:01:25.530 --> 00:01:27.679 
you're made we actually put them into
these<00:01:25.799> devices<00:01:26.040> that<00:01:26.460> actually<00:01:27.180> keep<00:01:27.420> these

00:01:27.679 --> 00:01:27.689 
these devices that actually keep these

00:01:27.689 --> 00:01:30.800 
these devices that actually keep these
organs<00:01:28.110> alive<00:01:28.290> and<00:01:29.009> till<00:01:29.340> we<00:01:29.460> implant<00:01:29.820> them<00:01:30.030> in

00:01:30.800 --> 00:01:30.810 
organs alive and till we implant them in

00:01:30.810 --> 00:01:32.450 
organs alive and till we implant them in
labs<00:01:31.140> across<00:01:31.530> the<00:01:31.650> country

00:01:32.450 --> 00:01:32.460 
labs across the country

00:01:32.460 --> 00:01:34.730 
labs across the country
scientists<00:01:33.180> are<00:01:33.270> breaking<00:01:33.659> new<00:01:33.869> ground<00:01:34.200> every

00:01:34.730 --> 00:01:34.740 
scientists are breaking new ground every

00:01:34.740 --> 00:01:37.100 
scientists are breaking new ground every

patient's own cells it was grown in a
lab<00:01:42.119> in<00:01:42.420> about<00:01:42.630> eight<00:01:42.869> weeks<00:01:43.549> tell<00:01:44.549> me<00:01:44.670> what

00:01:44.810 --> 00:01:44.820 
lab in about eight weeks tell me what

00:01:44.820 --> 00:01:46.819 
lab in about eight weeks tell me what
regenerative<00:01:45.390> medicine<00:01:45.659> could<00:01:46.290> do<00:01:46.439> to<00:01:46.710> our

00:01:46.819 --> 00:01:46.829 
regenerative medicine could do to our

regenerative medicine could do to our
longevity<00:01:47.100> how<00:01:47.729> long<00:01:47.970> could<00:01:48.450> we<00:01:48.509> live<00:01:48.869> I<00:01:49.049> think

00:01:49.160 --> 00:01:49.170 
longevity how long could we live I think

00:01:49.170 --> 00:01:51.980 
longevity how long could we live I think
it's<00:01:49.710> possible<00:01:49.979> to<00:01:50.310> keep<00:01:50.909> extending<00:01:51.360> life<00:01:51.689> and

00:01:51.980 --> 00:01:51.990 
it's possible to keep extending life and

00:01:51.990 --> 00:01:54.440 
it's possible to keep extending life and
by<00:01:52.680> putting<00:01:53.189> in<00:01:53.399> those<00:01:53.549> organs<00:01:54.030> that<00:01:54.180> you<00:01:54.270> need

00:01:54.440 --> 00:01:54.450 
by putting in those organs that you need

00:01:54.450 --> 00:01:56.929 
by putting in those organs that you need
putting<00:01:54.840> into<00:01:54.990> parts<00:01:55.560> that<00:01:55.649> you<00:01:55.860> need<00:01:55.939> you'll

00:01:56.929 --> 00:01:56.939 
putting into parts that you need you'll

00:01:56.939 --> 00:01:59.719 
putting into parts that you need you'll
be<00:01:57.119> able<00:01:57.210> to<00:01:57.450> extend<00:01:57.810> life<00:01:58.259> by<00:01:58.729> several

00:01:59.719 --> 00:01:59.729 
be able to extend life by several

00:01:59.729 --> 00:02:02.230 
be able to extend life by several

00:02:08.499 --> 00:02:08.509 
longevity well I think if we start

00:02:08.509 --> 00:02:11.250 
longevity well I think if we start
combining<00:02:08.830> things<00:02:09.830> like<00:02:10.100> better<00:02:10.729> prevention

combining things like better prevention

00:02:11.260 --> 00:02:13.960 
combining things like better prevention
better<00:02:12.260> care<00:02:12.620> doing<00:02:13.160> things<00:02:13.460> better<00:02:13.640> for<00:02:13.850> your

00:02:53.620 --> 00:02:53.630 
to try to get at these problems before

00:02:53.630 --> 00:02:56.260 
to try to get at these problems before
they<00:02:53.720> hit<00:02:53.780> us<00:02:53.840> that's<00:02:54.260> dated<00:02:54.680> sometimes<00:02:55.489> stuff

00:02:56.260 --> 00:02:56.270 
they hit us that's dated sometimes stuff

00:02:56.270 --> 00:02:58.540

happens right trauma diseases you

00:02:58.550 --> 00:02:59.680 
happens right trauma diseases you
couldn't<00:02:58.850> predict<00:02:59.209> you<00:02:59.390> have<00:02:59.480> to<00:02:59.600> have

00:02:59.680 --> 00:02:59.690 
couldn't predict you have to have

00:02:59.690 --> 00:03:01.270 
couldn't predict you have to have
surgery<00:03:00.080> to<00:03:00.110> take<00:03:00.320> a<00:03:00.380> cancer<00:03:00.800> out<00:03:00.950> and<00:03:01.160> so

00:03:01.270 --> 00:03:01.280 
surgery to take a cancer out and so

00:03:01.280 --> 00:03:02.740 
surgery to take a cancer out and so
you've<00:03:01.610> got<00:03:01.730> to<00:03:01.820> be<00:03:01.910> able<00:03:01.970> to<00:03:02.060> rebuild<00:03:02.510> the

00:03:02.740 --> 00:03:02.750 
you've got to be able to rebuild the

00:03:02.750 --> 00:03:04.600 
you've got to be able to rebuild the
body<00:03:02.930> so<00:03:03.230> take<00:03:03.380> that<00:03:03.500> bladder<00:03:03.770> as<00:03:04.040> an<00:03:04.160> example

00:03:04.600 --> 00:03:04.610 
body so take that bladder as an example

00:03:04.610 --> 00:03:06.100 
body so take that bladder as an example
so<00:03:04.700> let's<00:03:04.850> say<00:03:04.940> you<00:03:05.030> had<00:03:05.180> bladder<00:03:05.420> cancer<00:03:05.870> and

00:03:06.100 --> 00:03:06.110 
so let's say you had bladder cancer and

00:03:06.110 --> 00:03:07.509 
so let's say you had bladder cancer and
you<00:03:06.350> lost<00:03:06.530> your<00:03:06.620> bladder<00:03:06.890> what<00:03:07.280> are<00:03:07.370> you<00:03:07.430> gonna

recently there wasn't a lot but this is
what<00:03:12.459> was<00:03:13.459> in<00:03:13.610> that<00:03:13.640> video<00:03:14.120> this<00:03:14.600> feel<00:03:14.930> that

00:03:15.039 --> 00:03:15.049 
what was in that video this feel that

what was in that video this feel that
Oprah<00:03:15.320> this<00:03:15.890> is<00:03:16.070> actually<00:03:16.400> the<00:03:16.489> mold<00:03:16.790> that's

00:03:17.320 --> 00:03:17.330 
Oprah this is actually the mold that's

00:03:17.330 --> 00:03:19.780 
Oprah this is actually the mold that's
created<00:03:18.019> to<00:03:18.470> build<00:03:18.709> a<00:03:18.860> new<00:03:18.980> bladder<00:03:19.220> so<00:03:19.760> I

00:03:19.780 --> 00:03:19.790 
created to build a new bladder so I

00:03:19.790 --> 00:03:21.940 
created to build a new bladder so I
could<00:03:20.120> use<00:03:20.690> this<00:03:20.870> mold<00:03:21.170> take<00:03:21.530> some<00:03:21.709> of<00:03:21.830> your

00:03:21.940 --> 00:03:21.950 
could use this mold take some of your

00:03:21.950 --> 00:03:25.180 
could use this mold take some of your
blood<00:03:22.840> inject<00:03:23.840> it<00:03:23.959> around<00:03:24.170> this<00:03:24.440> and<00:03:24.709> over<00:03:25.040> a

00:03:25.180 --> 00:03:25.190 
blood inject it around this and over a

00:03:25.190 --> 00:03:26.680 
blood inject it around this and over a
couple<00:03:25.580> weeks<00:03:25.730> you'll<00:03:26.000> grow<00:03:26.299> your<00:03:26.510> own

00:03:26.680 --> 00:03:26.690

bladder
it'll<00:03:27.350> be<00:03:27.470> your<00:03:27.739> cells<00:03:31.660> that<00:03:32.660> is<00:03:32.810> incredible

00:03:39.250 --> 00:03:39.260 
and some cells and then put this in the

00:03:39.260 --> 00:03:40.570 
and some cells and then put this in the
mold<00:03:39.470> and<00:03:39.739> then<00:03:39.860> that's<00:03:40.010> what<00:03:40.160> they<00:03:40.280> do<00:03:40.340> they

00:03:40.570 --> 00:03:40.580 
mold and then that's what they do they

00:03:40.580 --> 00:03:42.580 
mold and then that's what they do they
incubate<00:03:40.880> it<00:03:41.239> incubate<00:03:41.870> and<00:03:42.140> here's<00:03:42.320> the<00:03:42.410> big

00:03:42.580 --> 00:03:42.590 
incubate it incubate and here's the big

00:03:42.590 --> 00:03:44.740 
incubate it incubate and here's the big
breakthrough<00:03:42.799> is<00:03:43.190> that<00:03:43.580> if<00:03:43.910> you<00:03:44.299> build<00:03:44.570> it

00:03:44.740 --> 00:03:44.750 
breakthrough is that if you build it

00:03:44.750 --> 00:03:46.740 
breakthrough is that if you build it
yeah<00:03:45.230> your<00:03:45.410> cells<00:03:45.709> will<00:03:45.799> come

00:03:46.740 --> 00:03:46.750 
yeah your cells will come

00:03:46.750 --> 00:03:49.360 
yeah your cells will come
that's<00:03:47.750> basically<00:03:48.170> it<00:03:48.440> yeah<00:03:48.739> and<00:03:48.890> so<00:03:49.010> we<00:03:49.190> can

00:03:49.360 --> 00:03:49.370 
that's basically it yeah and so we can

00:03:49.370 --> 00:03:51.580 
that's basically it yeah and so we can
actually<00:03:49.549> now<00:03:49.940> recognize<00:03:50.870> that<00:03:51.110> your<00:03:51.320> body's

00:03:51.580 --> 00:03:51.590 
actually now recognize that your body's

00:03:51.590 --> 00:03:53.500 
actually now recognize that your body's
continually<00:03:52.250> making<00:03:52.489> stem<00:03:52.850> cells<00:03:53.150> it's<00:03:53.360> all

00:03:53.500 --> 00:03:53.510 
continually making stem cells it's all

00:03:53.510 --> 00:03:55.900 
continually making stem cells it's all
about<00:03:53.720> stem<00:03:54.049> cells<00:03:54.320> to<00:03:54.680> a<00:03:54.709> large<00:03:54.890> extent<00:03:55.250> so<00:03:55.670> if

00:03:55.900 --> 00:03:55.910 
about stem cells to a large extent so if

00:03:55.910 --> 00:03:57.370 
about stem cells to a large extent so if
it<00:03:56.090> in<00:03:56.180> your<00:03:56.299> blood<00:03:56.540> right<00:03:56.780> now<00:03:56.840> their<00:03:57.170> stem

00:03:57.370 --> 00:03:57.380 
it in your blood right now their stem

00:03:57.380 --> 00:03:58.509 
it in your blood right now their stem
cells<00:03:57.620> looking<00:03:57.829> around<00:03:58.070> there<00:03:58.220> so<00:03:58.340> you<00:03:58.430> know

00:03:58.509 --> 00:03:58.519 
cells looking around there so you know

00:03:58.519 --> 00:03:58.810 
cells looking around there so you know
what

00:03:58.810 --> 00:03:58.820 
what

00:03:58.820 --> 00:04:00.370 
what
Oprah's<00:03:59.269> left<00:03:59.480> eye<00:03:59.600> is<00:03:59.660> not<00:03:59.870> so<00:04:00.019> healthy<00:04:00.290> today

00:04:00.370 --> 00:04:00.380 
Oprah's left eye is not so healthy today

00:04:00.380 --> 00:04:02.020 
Oprah's left eye is not so healthy today
I'm<00:04:00.530> gonna<00:04:00.620> go<00:04:00.829> in<00:04:00.980> there<00:04:01.130> and<00:04:01.190> fix<00:04:01.459> it<00:04:01.670> yeah

00:04:02.020 --> 00:04:02.030 
I'm gonna go in there and fix it yeah

00:04:02.030 --> 00:04:04.180 
I'm gonna go in there and fix it yeah
and<00:04:02.239> so<00:04:02.630> we<00:04:02.959> don't<00:04:03.079> didn't<00:04:03.560> know<00:04:03.650> too<00:04:03.829> recently

00:04:04.180 --> 00:04:04.190 
and so we don't didn't know too recently

00:04:04.190 --> 00:04:05.500 
and so we don't didn't know too recently
how<00:04:04.310> to<00:04:04.370> turn<00:04:04.670> that<00:04:04.700> up<00:04:04.910> a<00:04:05.090> little<00:04:05.209> bit

00:04:05.500 --> 00:04:05.510 
how to turn that up a little bit

00:04:05.510 --> 00:04:07.420 
how to turn that up a little bit
regenerative<00:04:06.140> medicine<00:04:06.530> is<00:04:06.860> about<00:04:07.100> getting

00:04:07.420 --> 00:04:07.430 
regenerative medicine is about getting

00:04:07.430 --> 00:04:09.460 
regenerative medicine is about getting
that<00:04:07.790> work<00:04:08.120> for<00:04:08.390> a<00:04:08.420> bladder<00:04:08.720> outside<00:04:09.290> your

00:04:09.460 --> 00:04:09.470 
that work for a bladder outside your

00:04:09.470 --> 00:04:11.259 
that work for a bladder outside your
body<00:04:09.620> this<00:04:10.190> is<00:04:10.340> an<00:04:10.430> example<00:04:10.760> let's<00:04:11.030> say<00:04:11.120> your

00:04:11.259 --> 00:04:11.269 
body this is an example let's say your

00:04:11.269 --> 00:04:13.090 
body this is an example let's say your
this<00:04:11.419> is<00:04:11.630> like<00:04:11.810> scientist<00:04:12.350> Eve<00:04:12.530> was<00:04:12.709> right<00:04:12.919> it

00:04:13.090 --> 00:04:13.100 
this is like scientist Eve was right it

00:04:13.100 --> 00:04:13.570 
this is like scientist Eve was right it
is<00:04:13.220> like

00:04:13.570 --> 00:04:13.580 
is like

00:04:13.580 --> 00:04:14.920 
is like
you<00:04:13.700> know<00:04:13.820> what<00:04:14.120> you<00:04:14.270> should<00:04:14.480> read<00:04:14.570> about<00:04:14.690> in

00:04:14.920 --> 00:04:14.930 
you know what you should read about in

00:04:14.930 --> 00:04:16.660 
you know what you should read about in
science<00:04:15.080> fiction<00:04:15.350> or<00:04:15.770> couldn't<00:04:16.370> even<00:04:16.549> imagine

00:04:16.660 --> 00:04:16.670 
science fiction or couldn't even imagine

00:04:16.670 --> 00:04:19.570 
science fiction or couldn't even imagine
happening<00:04:17.830> unbelievable<00:04:18.830> I<00:04:18.950> have<00:04:19.250> shown<00:04:19.549> you

happening unbelievable I have shown you
in<00:04:20.090> the<00:04:20.299> past

00:04:20.860 --> 00:04:20.870 
in the past

00:04:20.870 --> 00:04:24.490 
in the past
yes<00:04:21.049> livers<00:04:21.590> yes<00:04:22.130> that<00:04:22.670> feel<00:04:23.030> that<00:04:23.260> this<00:04:24.260> is<00:04:24.470> a

00:04:24.490 --> 00:04:24.500 
yes livers yes that feel that this is a

00:04:24.500 --> 00:04:26.650 
yes livers yes that feel that this is a
liver<00:04:24.860> yeah<00:04:25.430> that<00:04:25.700> has<00:04:25.790> had<00:04:25.940> all<00:04:26.120> the<00:04:26.360> cells

00:04:26.650 --> 00:04:26.660 
liver yeah that has had all the cells

00:04:26.660 --> 00:04:27.580 
liver yeah that has had all the cells
taken<00:04:26.960> out<00:04:27.200> of<00:04:27.350> it

00:04:27.580 --> 00:04:27.590 
taken out of it

00:04:27.590 --> 00:04:30.370 
taken out of it
uh-huh<00:04:28.580> so<00:04:28.730> all<00:04:28.910> this<00:04:29.090> left<00:04:29.330> behind<00:04:29.690> was<00:04:30.050> was

00:04:30.370 --> 00:04:30.380 
uh-huh so all this left behind was was

00:04:30.380 --> 00:04:32.350 
uh-huh so all this left behind was was
somebody's<00:04:30.950> liver<00:04:31.190> this<00:04:31.730> was<00:04:32.120> an<00:04:32.210> animal

00:04:32.350 --> 00:04:32.360 
somebody's liver this was an animal

00:04:32.360 --> 00:04:34.480 
somebody's liver this was an animal
liver<00:04:32.720> okay<00:04:32.990> and<00:04:33.380> all<00:04:33.740> the<00:04:33.950> cells<00:04:34.220> have<00:04:34.400> been

00:04:34.480 --> 00:04:34.490 
liver okay and all the cells have been

00:04:34.490 --> 00:04:36.520 
liver okay and all the cells have been
taken<00:04:34.790> out<00:04:34.880> so<00:04:35.030> you're<00:04:35.150> left<00:04:35.300> with<00:04:35.420> a<00:04:35.600> the<00:04:36.080> two

00:04:36.520 --> 00:04:36.530 
taken out so you're left with a the two

00:04:36.530 --> 00:04:38.680 
taken out so you're left with a the two
by<00:04:36.710> fours<00:04:37.100> that<00:04:37.580> are<00:04:37.700> the<00:04:37.820> structure<00:04:38.420> of<00:04:38.570> the

00:04:38.680 --> 00:04:38.690 
by fours that are the structure of the

00:04:38.690 --> 00:04:40.150 
by fours that are the structure of the
oregon<00:04:38.990> without<00:04:39.200> the<00:04:39.350> actual<00:04:39.650> cells<00:04:39.890> in<00:04:40.070> it

00:04:40.150 --> 00:04:40.160 
oregon without the actual cells in it

00:04:40.160 --> 00:04:42.220 
oregon without the actual cells in it
okay<00:04:40.520> so<00:04:40.760> let's<00:04:40.940> say<00:04:41.090> I<00:04:41.120> took<00:04:41.480> an<00:04:41.780> organ<00:04:42.110> like

00:04:42.220 --> 00:04:42.230 
okay so let's say I took an organ like

00:04:42.230 --> 00:04:44.440 
okay so let's say I took an organ like
this<00:04:42.380> out<00:04:42.590> of<00:04:42.620> an<00:04:43.280> animal<00:04:43.460> and<00:04:43.910> I<00:04:43.970> put<00:04:44.210> your

00:04:44.440 --> 00:04:44.450 
this out of an animal and I put your

00:04:44.450 --> 00:04:45.640 
this out of an animal and I put your
cells<00:04:44.750> in<00:04:44.960> it<00:04:45.050> uh-huh

00:04:45.640 --> 00:04:45.650 
cells in it uh-huh

00:04:45.650 --> 00:04:48.280 
cells in it uh-huh
you<00:04:45.890> could<00:04:46.100> grow<00:04:46.400> your<00:04:46.430> own<00:04:46.700> liver<00:04:47.150> so<00:04:48.080> when<00:04:48.260> I

00:04:48.280 --> 00:04:48.290 
you could grow your own liver so when I

00:04:48.290 --> 00:04:50.170 
you could grow your own liver so when I
look<00:04:48.860> to<00:04:49.040> do<00:04:49.160> a<00:04:49.190> transplant<00:04:49.700> on<00:04:50.000> you<00:04:50.150> I

00:04:50.170 --> 00:04:50.180 
look to do a transplant on you I

00:04:50.180 --> 00:04:51.940 
look to do a transplant on you I
wouldn't<00:04:50.510> have<00:04:50.570> to<00:04:50.750> take<00:04:50.960> a<00:04:51.200> dead<00:04:51.470> person's

00:04:51.940 --> 00:04:51.950 
wouldn't have to take a dead person's

00:04:51.950 --> 00:04:54.430 
wouldn't have to take a dead person's
all<00:04:52.460> we<00:04:52.700> need<00:04:52.880> is<00:04:53.030> is<00:04:53.240> this<00:04:53.480> mold<00:04:53.780> I'll<00:04:54.050> take<00:04:54.260> my

00:04:54.430 --> 00:04:54.440 
all we need is is this mold I'll take my

00:04:54.440 --> 00:04:56.650 
all we need is is this mold I'll take my
blood<00:04:54.710> stripping<00:04:55.340> it<00:04:55.460> down<00:04:55.490> yeah<00:04:56.180> put<00:04:56.540> the

00:04:56.650 --> 00:04:56.660 
blood stripping it down yeah put the

00:04:56.660 --> 00:04:59.620 
blood stripping it down yeah put the
cells<00:04:56.900> into<00:04:57.560> this<00:04:57.710> based<00:04:58.550> it<00:04:58.880> in<00:04:59.000> that<00:04:59.150> chamber

00:04:59.620 --> 00:04:59.630 
cells into this based it in that chamber

00:04:59.630 --> 00:05:01.450 
cells into this based it in that chamber
that<00:04:59.870> we<00:04:59.990> showed<00:05:00.230> in<00:05:00.500> the<00:05:00.620> video<00:05:00.950> and<00:05:01.220> it<00:05:01.340> would

00:05:01.450 --> 00:05:01.460 
that we showed in the video and it would

00:05:01.460 --> 00:05:13.900 
that we showed in the video and it would
slowly<00:05:01.670> grow<00:05:02.030> your<00:05:02.390> own<00:05:02.420> organ<00:05:02.900> back<00:05:12.730> so<00:05:13.730> that

00:05:13.900 --> 00:05:13.910 
slowly grow your own organ back so that

00:05:13.910 --> 00:05:14.920 
slowly grow your own organ back so that
means<00:05:14.150> if<00:05:14.330> you're<00:05:14.450> gonna<00:05:14.540> have<00:05:14.690> a<00:05:14.720> heart

00:05:14.920 --> 00:05:14.930 
means if you're gonna have a heart

00:05:14.930 --> 00:05:17.170 
means if you're gonna have a heart
transplant<00:05:15.620> you<00:05:16.340> could<00:05:16.520> have<00:05:16.730> a<00:05:16.940> heart

00:05:17.170 --> 00:05:17.180 
transplant you could have a heart

00:05:17.180 --> 00:05:19.420 
transplant you could have a heart

stuff I had no idea how far this field
has<00:05:38.240> come<00:05:38.390> Wow

00:05:39.070 --> 00:05:39.080 
has come Wow

the<00:05:41.180> other<00:05:41.390> thing<00:05:41.570> we<00:05:41.660> learned<00:05:41.810> with<00:05:42.110> these

00:05:42.450 --> 00:05:42.460 
the other thing we learned with these

00:05:42.460 --> 00:05:44.530 
the other thing we learned with these
tissues<00:05:43.460> is<00:05:43.730> that<00:05:43.970> you<00:05:44.030> have<00:05:44.180> to<00:05:44.300> actually

00:05:44.530 --> 00:05:44.540 
tissues is that you have to actually

00:05:44.540 --> 00:05:47.230 
tissues is that you have to actually
stretch<00:05:44.840> them<00:05:45.050> tissue<00:05:45.770> wants<00:05:46.190> to<00:05:46.310> be<00:05:46.430> used<00:05:46.700> see

00:05:47.230 --> 00:05:47.240 
stretch them tissue wants to be used see

00:05:47.240 --> 00:05:49.540 
stretch them tissue wants to be used see
that<00:05:47.360> inside<00:05:47.630> this<00:05:47.750> tube<00:05:47.990> yeah<00:05:48.470> that's<00:05:49.400> the

00:05:49.540 --> 00:05:49.550 
that inside this tube yeah that's the

00:05:49.550 --> 00:05:51.460 
that inside this tube yeah that's the
artery<00:05:49.940> put<00:05:50.600> your<00:05:50.720> finger<00:05:50.990> right<00:05:51.169> next<00:05:51.320> to

00:05:51.460 --> 00:05:51.470 
artery put your finger right next to

00:05:51.470 --> 00:05:52.720 
artery put your finger right next to
that<00:05:51.530> trachea<00:05:52.070> and<00:05:52.250> you<00:05:52.370> feel<00:05:52.550> that<00:05:52.640> little

00:05:52.720 --> 00:05:52.730 
that trachea and you feel that little

00:05:52.730 --> 00:05:55.240 
that trachea and you feel that little
pulse<00:05:53.030> at<00:05:53.560> their<00:05:54.560> little<00:05:54.680> bounciness

00:05:55.240 --> 00:05:55.250 
pulse at their little bounciness

00:05:55.250 --> 00:05:57.880 
pulse at their little bounciness
I<00:05:55.460> didn't<00:05:56.210> hear<00:05:56.360> okay<00:05:57.140> that's<00:05:57.320> the<00:05:57.500> carotid

00:05:57.880 --> 00:05:57.890 
I didn't hear okay that's the carotid

00:05:57.890 --> 00:05:58.360 
I didn't hear okay that's the carotid
artery

00:05:58.360 --> 00:05:58.370 
artery

00:05:58.370 --> 00:06:01.930 
artery
that's<00:05:58.820> this<00:05:59.120> artery<00:05:59.450> but<00:06:00.020> it's<00:06:00.169> made<00:06:00.940> from

00:06:01.930 --> 00:06:01.940 
that's this artery but it's made from

00:06:01.940 --> 00:06:04.900 
that's this artery but it's made from
this<00:06:02.060> mold<00:06:02.390> let<00:06:02.750> me<00:06:02.840> have<00:06:02.930> your<00:06:03.020> hand<00:06:03.229> huh<00:06:03.910> and

00:06:04.900 --> 00:06:04.910 
this mold let me have your hand huh and

00:06:04.910 --> 00:06:07.870 
this mold let me have your hand huh and
just<00:06:05.270> hold<00:06:05.450> it<00:06:05.600> up<00:06:05.630> yeah<00:06:06.010> you<00:06:07.010> see<00:06:07.220> that<00:06:07.250> that

00:06:07.870 --> 00:06:07.880 
just hold it up yeah you see that that

00:06:07.880 --> 00:06:09.820 
just hold it up yeah you see that that
straw<00:06:08.300> it<00:06:08.570> looks<00:06:08.720> like<00:06:08.840> a<00:06:08.930> straw<00:06:09.200> but<00:06:09.680> if<00:06:09.770> you

00:06:09.820 --> 00:06:09.830 
straw it looks like a straw but if you

00:06:09.830 --> 00:06:11.530 
straw it looks like a straw but if you
take<00:06:10.040> that<00:06:10.250> straw<00:06:10.580> again<00:06:10.910> it's<00:06:11.060> just<00:06:11.090> a<00:06:11.300> mold

00:06:11.530 --> 00:06:11.540 
take that straw again it's just a mold

00:06:11.540 --> 00:06:13.900 
take that straw again it's just a mold
and<00:06:11.870> you<00:06:11.990> plant<00:06:12.440> cells<00:06:12.979> on<00:06:13.280> it<00:06:13.460> and<00:06:13.610> then<00:06:13.820> you

00:06:13.900 --> 00:06:13.910 
and you plant cells on it and then you

00:06:13.910 --> 00:06:15.730 
and you plant cells on it and then you
put<00:06:14.120> it<00:06:14.210> in<00:06:14.330> a<00:06:14.419> chamber<00:06:14.660> and<00:06:14.960> push<00:06:15.229> on<00:06:15.470> it<00:06:15.590> like

00:06:15.730 --> 00:06:15.740 
put it in a chamber and push on it like

00:06:15.740 --> 00:06:16.870 
put it in a chamber and push on it like
your<00:06:15.860> heart<00:06:16.130> will<00:06:16.250> be<00:06:16.310> pushing<00:06:16.520> on<00:06:16.700> a<00:06:16.729> blood

00:06:16.870 --> 00:06:16.880 
your heart will be pushing on a blood

00:06:16.880 --> 00:06:19.300 
your heart will be pushing on a blood
vessel<00:06:17.000> you<00:06:17.510> can<00:06:17.540> regrow<00:06:18.080> blood<00:06:18.320> vessel<00:06:18.710> which

00:06:19.300 --> 00:06:19.310 
vessel you can regrow blood vessel which

00:06:19.310 --> 00:06:20.530 
vessel you can regrow blood vessel which
means<00:06:19.520> that<00:06:19.729> all<00:06:19.880> of<00:06:19.910> these<00:06:20.120> different

00:06:20.530 --> 00:06:20.540 
means that all of these different

00:06:20.540 --> 00:06:21.640 
means that all of these different
synthetic<00:06:20.960> products<00:06:21.290> should<00:06:21.410> have<00:06:21.500> put

00:06:21.640 --> 00:06:21.650 
synthetic products should have put

00:06:21.650 --> 00:06:23.260 
synthetic products should have put
inside<00:06:21.860> your<00:06:22.070> body<00:06:22.130> we<00:06:22.880> don't<00:06:22.970> have<00:06:23.120> to<00:06:23.180> do

00:06:23.260 --> 00:06:23.270 
inside your body we don't have to do

00:06:23.270 --> 00:06:24.460 
inside your body we don't have to do
that<00:06:23.390> anymore<00:06:23.600> we<00:06:23.810> could<00:06:23.930> actually<00:06:24.050> make

00:06:24.460 --> 00:06:24.470 
that anymore we could actually make

00:06:24.470 --> 00:06:26.350 
that anymore we could actually make
blood<00:06:24.979> vessels<00:06:25.400> to<00:06:25.460> replace<00:06:25.789> your<00:06:25.970> busted

00:06:26.350 --> 00:06:26.360 
blood vessels to replace your busted

00:06:26.360 --> 00:06:27.080 
blood vessels to replace your busted
blood<00:06:26.539> vessels

00:06:27.080 --> 00:06:27.090 
blood vessels

00:06:27.090 --> 00:06:28.250 
blood vessels
and<00:06:27.210> how<00:06:27.360> long<00:06:27.540> would<00:06:27.660> it<00:06:27.720> take<00:06:27.870> to<00:06:28.110> do<00:06:28.230> that

00:06:28.250 --> 00:06:28.260 
and how long would it take to do that

00:06:28.260 --> 00:06:30.140 
and how long would it take to do that
though<00:06:28.650> this<00:06:28.860> this<00:06:29.070> takes<00:06:29.310> weeks<00:06:29.610> not<00:06:29.970> years

00:06:30.140 --> 00:06:30.150 
though this this takes weeks not years

00:06:30.150 --> 00:06:32.090 
though this this takes weeks not years
or<00:06:30.660> months<00:06:30.960> right<00:06:31.290> and<00:06:31.530> it's<00:06:31.680> pretty<00:06:32.010> short

00:06:32.090 --> 00:06:32.100 
or months right and it's pretty short

00:06:32.100 --> 00:06:34.580 
or months right and it's pretty short
term<00:06:32.610> which<00:06:33.180> is<00:06:33.330> why<00:06:33.420> it's<00:06:33.630> becoming<00:06:34.050> into

00:06:34.580 --> 00:06:34.590 
term which is why it's becoming into

00:06:34.590 --> 00:06:36.410 
term which is why it's becoming into
something<00:06:35.430> that's<00:06:35.490> viable<00:06:35.760> for<00:06:36.090> clinical

00:06:36.410 --> 00:06:36.420 
something that's viable for clinical

00:06:36.420 --> 00:06:38.540 
something that's viable for clinical
practice
