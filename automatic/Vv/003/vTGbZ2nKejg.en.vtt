a couple of rubber bands one kind of

00:02:34.580 --> 00:02:40.750 
a couple of rubber bands one kind of
halfway<00:02:34.850> up<00:02:35.390> to<00:02:35.660> hold<00:02:37.690> was<00:02:38.690> going<00:02:38.960> to<00:02:39.020> be<00:02:39.760> the

00:02:40.750 --> 00:02:40.760 
halfway up to hold was going to be the

00:02:40.760 --> 00:02:42.520 
halfway up to hold was going to be the
bending<00:02:41.180> part<00:02:41.210> of<00:02:41.540> the<00:02:41.690> boat<00:02:41.870> and<00:02:42.080> then<00:02:42.230> one

00:02:42.520 --> 00:02:42.530 
bending part of the boat and then one

00:02:42.530 --> 00:02:44.590 
bending part of the boat and then one
closer<00:02:43.010> to<00:02:43.370> the<00:02:43.490> end<00:02:43.670> if<00:02:44.000> I<00:02:44.120> can<00:02:44.270> get<00:02:44.420> these

00:02:44.590 --> 00:02:44.600 
closer to the end if I can get these

00:02:44.600 --> 00:02:50.200 
closer to the end if I can get these
damn<00:02:44.840> rubber<00:02:45.170> bands<00:02:45.440> to<00:02:45.770> stretch<00:02:48.880> tips<00:02:49.880> of<00:02:50.090> my

00:02:50.200 --> 00:02:50.210 
damn rubber bands to stretch tips of my

00:02:50.210 --> 00:02:53.520 
damn rubber bands to stretch tips of my
locks

00:02:53.520 --> 00:02:53.530 

00:02:53.530 --> 00:03:14.700 

then

00:03:14.700 --> 00:03:14.710 

00:03:14.710 --> 00:03:18.990 

all<00:03:15.160> right<00:03:15.310> so<00:03:17.130> this<00:03:18.130> is<00:03:18.190> where<00:03:18.460> the<00:03:18.610> magic

00:03:18.990 --> 00:03:19.000 
all right so this is where the magic

00:03:19.000 --> 00:03:25.790 
all right so this is where the magic
begins<00:03:19.240> or<00:03:20.080> happens

00:03:25.790 --> 00:03:25.800 

00:03:25.800 --> 00:03:29.750 

so<00:03:26.400> now<00:03:26.550> all<00:03:26.610> I'm<00:03:26.760> going<00:03:26.820> to<00:03:26.970> do<00:03:27.120> is<00:03:27.420> bend<00:03:28.760> this

00:03:29.750 --> 00:03:29.760 
so now all I'm going to do is bend this

00:03:29.760 --> 00:03:41.559 
so now all I'm going to do is bend this
and<00:03:30.210> I'm<00:03:30.450> going<00:03:30.720> to<00:03:30.960> get<00:03:31.520> one<00:03:32.520> of<00:03:32.670> my<00:03:32.910> headbands

00:03:41.559 --> 00:03:41.569

00:04:13.750 --> 00:04:13.760 
for the other side of my bow that's why

00:04:13.760 --> 00:04:16.779 
for the other side of my bow that's why
it<00:04:13.819> looks<00:04:14.120> so<00:04:14.239> big<00:04:15.099> so<00:04:16.099> now<00:04:16.280> all<00:04:16.340> I<00:04:16.459> have<00:04:16.579> to<00:04:16.669> do

00:04:16.779 --> 00:04:16.789 
it looks so big so now all I have to do

00:04:16.789 --> 00:04:21.520 
it looks so big so now all I have to do
is<00:04:16.970> Bend<00:04:17.299> that<00:04:17.449> around<00:04:17.810> it<00:04:19.090> and<00:04:20.169> I'm<00:04:21.169> going<00:04:21.380> to

00:04:21.520 --> 00:04:21.530 
is Bend that around it and I'm going to

00:04:21.530 --> 00:04:25.120 
is Bend that around it and I'm going to
tuck<00:04:21.919> this<00:04:23.289> inside<00:04:24.289> the<00:04:24.500> headband<00:04:24.860> that<00:04:25.009> I

00:04:25.120 --> 00:04:25.130 
tuck this inside the headband that I

00:04:25.130 --> 00:04:31.749 
tuck this inside the headband that I
just<00:04:25.460> put<00:04:25.729> on<00:04:26.440> to<00:04:27.440> secure<00:04:28.990> and<00:04:30.430> then<00:04:31.430> the<00:04:31.550> tip

00:04:31.749 --> 00:04:31.759 
just put on to secure and then the tip

00:04:31.759 --> 00:04:34.510 
just put on to secure and then the tip
of<00:04:31.970> this<00:04:32.780> side<00:04:33.110> will<00:04:33.380> go<00:04:33.530> on<00:04:33.740> the<00:04:33.830> inside<00:04:34.280> of

00:04:34.510 --> 00:04:34.520 
of this side will go on the inside of

00:04:34.520 --> 00:04:37.300 
of this side will go on the inside of
this<00:04:34.759> book<00:04:35.060> now<00:04:35.960> the<00:04:36.020> reason<00:04:36.500> I<00:04:36.680> did<00:04:36.889> one<00:04:37.070> side

00:04:37.300 --> 00:04:37.310 
this book now the reason I did one side

00:04:37.310 --> 00:04:39.029 
this book now the reason I did one side
bigger<00:04:37.550> than<00:04:37.759> the<00:04:37.849> other<00:04:38.060> and<00:04:38.150> it'll<00:04:38.479> even<00:04:38.720> out

00:04:39.029 --> 00:04:39.039 
bigger than the other and it'll even out

00:04:39.039 --> 00:04:42.129 
bigger than the other and it'll even out
this<00:04:40.039> side<00:04:40.370> is<00:04:40.669> bigger<00:04:41.030> so<00:04:41.509> that<00:04:41.539> I'll<00:04:41.870> have

00:04:42.129 --> 00:04:42.139 
this side is bigger so that I'll have

00:04:42.139 --> 00:04:44.560 
this side is bigger so that I'll have
more<00:04:42.530> to<00:04:42.830> fill<00:04:43.160> in<00:04:43.400> the<00:04:43.729> side<00:04:43.940> that's<00:04:44.180> not<00:04:44.270> as

00:04:44.560 --> 00:04:44.570 
more to fill in the side that's not as

00:04:44.570 --> 00:04:47.200 
more to fill in the side that's not as
big<00:04:44.810> and<00:04:45.110> then<00:04:45.710> on<00:04:45.949> this<00:04:46.190> side<00:04:46.250> is<00:04:46.760> smaller

00:04:47.200 --> 00:04:47.210 
big and then on this side is smaller

00:04:47.210 --> 00:04:49.240 
big and then on this side is smaller
because<00:04:47.780> I<00:04:47.810> don't<00:04:48.080> need<00:04:48.289> that<00:04:48.530> much<00:04:48.800> filling

00:04:49.240 --> 00:04:49.250 
because I don't need that much filling

00:04:49.250 --> 00:04:52.240 
because I don't need that much filling
on<00:04:49.430> on<00:04:49.820> this<00:04:50.419> side<00:04:50.720> you<00:04:51.680> guys<00:04:51.860> wouldn't<00:04:52.099> get

00:04:52.240 --> 00:04:52.250 
on on this side you guys wouldn't get

00:04:52.250 --> 00:04:55.629 
on on this side you guys wouldn't get
what<00:04:52.340> I'm<00:04:52.430> saying<00:04:52.639> and<00:04:54.280> that's<00:04:55.280> for<00:04:55.520> me

00:04:55.629 --> 00:04:55.639 
what I'm saying and that's for me

00:04:55.639 --> 00:04:58.990 
what I'm saying and that's for me
because<00:04:56.000> my<00:04:56.210> hair<00:04:56.570> is<00:04:56.780> shaved<00:04:57.229> on<00:04:57.830> one<00:04:58.010> side<00:04:58.280> so

00:04:58.990 --> 00:04:59.000 
because my hair is shaved on one side so

00:04:59.000 --> 00:05:02.710 
because my hair is shaved on one side so
that<00:04:59.030> was<00:04:59.479> on<00:05:00.430> how<00:05:01.430> I<00:05:01.460> justified<00:05:02.120> it<00:05:02.150> I<00:05:02.479> guess

00:05:02.710 --> 00:05:02.720 
that was on how I justified it I guess

00:05:02.720 --> 00:05:05.260 
that was on how I justified it I guess
if<00:05:02.900> you<00:05:03.020> do<00:05:03.260> it<00:05:03.380> in<00:05:03.500> even<00:05:03.889> sections<00:05:04.340> you<00:05:05.210> can

00:05:05.260 --> 00:05:05.270 
if you do it in even sections you can

00:05:05.270 --> 00:05:08.860 
if you do it in even sections you can
get<00:05:05.570> the<00:05:05.720> same<00:05:05.900> effect<00:05:05.960> as<00:05:06.500> well<00:05:07.630> but<00:05:08.630> that's

00:05:08.860 --> 00:05:08.870 
get the same effect as well but that's

00:05:08.870 --> 00:05:16.629 
get the same effect as well but that's
how<00:05:08.990> I<00:05:09.020> justified<00:05:09.650> it<00:05:09.680> in<00:05:09.860> my<00:05:10.010> head<00:05:10.330> on<00:05:11.330> Hyo
