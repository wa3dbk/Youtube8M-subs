a<00:02:53.769> refurbished<00:02:54.310> one<00:02:54.459> or<00:02:55.269> anything<00:02:55.599> but<00:02:55.950> if

a refurbished one or anything but if

00:02:56.950 --> 00:03:00.559 
a refurbished one or anything but if
it's<00:02:57.329> refurbished<00:02:58.329> then<00:02:58.900> it's<00:02:59.260> definitely

00:03:00.559 --> 00:03:00.569 
it's refurbished then it's definitely

00:03:00.569 --> 00:03:04.199 
it's refurbished then it's definitely
not<00:03:01.569> as<00:03:01.810> fast<00:03:02.049> as<00:03:02.379> it<00:03:02.560> should<00:03:03.069> be<00:03:03.280> and<00:03:03.819> if

00:03:04.199 --> 00:03:04.209 
not as fast as it should be and if

00:03:04.209 --> 00:03:06.089 
not as fast as it should be and if
that's<00:03:04.359> the<00:03:04.569> case<00:03:04.659> it<00:03:05.079> probably<00:03:05.260> runs<00:03:05.590> faster

00:03:06.089 --> 00:03:06.099 
that's the case it probably runs faster
