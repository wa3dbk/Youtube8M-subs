the grill let's score the skin tag and
lay<00:00:49.079> the<00:00:49.710> curling<00:00:50.010> problem<00:00:50.489> also<00:00:50.730> occurs<00:00:51.000> with

00:00:51.439 --> 00:00:51.449 
lay the curling problem also occurs with

00:00:51.449 --> 00:00:54.290 
lay the curling problem also occurs with
all<00:00:51.660> types<00:00:52.020> of<00:00:52.199> bass<00:00:52.530> and<00:00:52.860> sometimes<00:00:53.730> bluefish

all types of bass and sometimes bluefish
but<00:00:55.110> scoring<00:00:55.500> the<00:00:55.620> skin<00:00:55.739> prevents<00:00:56.340> it<00:00:56.520> from

00:00:56.660 --> 00:00:56.670 
but scoring the skin prevents it from

00:00:56.670 --> 00:00:59.060 
but scoring the skin prevents it from
getting<00:00:56.910> a<00:00:57.149> grip<00:00:57.420> on<00:00:57.719> the<00:00:57.960> flesh<00:00:58.199> and<00:00:58.440> working
