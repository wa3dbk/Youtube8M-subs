00:00:06.960 --> 00:00:11.130
 german very much like to receive and thank you 

00:00:09.690 --> 00:00:13.530
 for accepting our invitation to the doctor 

00:00:11.130 --> 00:00:15.150
 francisco espinoza the expression of the 

00:00:13.530 --> 00:00:18.330
 Mexican foundation for boys and girls 

00:00:15.150 --> 00:00:19.619
 with immunodeficiencies like this doctor 

00:00:18.330 --> 00:00:21.599
 very good, thank you very much for the 

00:00:19.619 --> 00:00:24.270
 invitation thank you for accepting 

00:00:21.599 --> 00:00:26.040
 come let 's input before we 

00:00:24.270 --> 00:00:28.700
 explain what the foundation is 

00:00:26.040 --> 00:00:31.860
 you are in primary immunodeficiencies 

00:00:28.700 --> 00:00:34.140
 are the primary deficiencies are 

00:00:31.860 --> 00:00:35.370
 defects of your immune system 

00:00:34.140 --> 00:00:37.170
 this system that is responsible for 

00:00:35.370 --> 00:00:39.809
 protect you against the aggressions of 

00:00:37.170 --> 00:00:43.079
 outside against infections and these 

00:00:39.809 --> 00:00:45.239
 children and adults because it also happens to 

00:00:43.079 --> 00:00:48.329
 adults are born with a defect 

00:00:45.239 --> 00:00:51.089
 genetic a defect that is inherited 

00:00:48.329 --> 00:00:53.129
 although they inherit the children and that they 

00:00:51.089 --> 00:00:55.019
 makes them defend themselves less well by 

00:00:53.129 --> 00:00:57.960
 they both have more infections than 

00:00:55.019 --> 00:00:59.760
 expected or infections by little germs 

00:00:57.960 --> 00:01:02.010
 common than you and I would not do us 

00:00:59.760 --> 00:01:03.899
 no harm to these children can be 

00:01:02.010 --> 00:01:06.180
 put very serious or infection it 

00:01:03.899 --> 00:01:08.070
 complicated because beyond that 

00:01:06.180 --> 00:01:09.690
 they only heal after a long time 

00:01:08.070 --> 00:01:11.479
 of antibiotics and that are affecting 

00:01:09.690 --> 00:01:12.840
 again and again until 

00:01:11.479 --> 00:01:15.929
 unfortunately in something 

00:01:12.840 --> 00:01:17.880
 if they do not recognize themselves in time they get complicated 

00:01:15.929 --> 00:01:19.229
 and can even cause the death of 

00:01:17.880 --> 00:01:20.009
 our patients this is going to 

00:01:19.229 --> 00:01:21.960
 ask 

00:01:20.009 --> 00:01:24.990
 just doctor why for example a 

00:01:21.960 --> 00:01:27.329
 child with diarrhea child with the flu as well 

00:01:24.990 --> 00:01:30.509
 It looks normal because if you ate something, it's not 

00:01:27.329 --> 00:01:32.340
 it fell well as you know when it's something 

00:01:30.509 --> 00:01:35.009
 more and when we should worry 

00:01:32.340 --> 00:01:37.049
 when they exceed what is expected is to say 

00:01:35.009 --> 00:01:40.170
 normal that a child going to daycare and 

00:01:37.049 --> 00:01:42.270
 that came in two months and that started 

00:01:40.170 --> 00:01:43.799
 they have more infections than usual 

00:01:42.270 --> 00:01:45.810
 than a child who is at home who does not 

00:01:43.799 --> 00:01:47.789
 can grandma or mom and not 

00:01:45.810 --> 00:01:49.590
 they have contact with other children they 

00:01:47.789 --> 00:01:51.060
 sick beyond but the child that has 

00:01:49.590 --> 00:01:52.890
 serious infections for example that has 

00:01:51.060 --> 00:01:55.560
 more than one pneumonia that has more than 

00:01:52.890 --> 00:01:57.509
 four and a half hours in a year that has 

00:01:55.560 --> 00:02:00.179
 more than two frames like that in 200 in a year 

00:01:57.509 --> 00:02:02.579
 or that these infections are common as 

00:02:00.179 --> 00:02:04.319
 otitis or we do it and they get complicated or 

00:02:02.579 --> 00:02:06.390
 that are caused as he said by germs 

00:02:04.319 --> 00:02:08.310
 that are not frequent that we have there 

00:02:06.390 --> 00:02:10.379
 than to think that starting should turn on the 

00:02:08.310 --> 00:02:11.760
 focus to suspect that in this 

00:02:10.379 --> 00:02:13.709
 possibility or problem is Carlos 

00:02:11.760 --> 00:02:15.209
 doctors train us very well for 

00:02:13.709 --> 00:02:16.980
 treat infections but not for 

00:02:15.209 --> 00:02:18.629
 think because this boy or girl 

00:02:16.980 --> 00:02:21.599
 you are so unlucky because you are 

00:02:18.629 --> 00:02:23.209
 complicating so much and hence the idea of 

00:02:21.599 --> 00:02:24.810
 create this foundation because 

00:02:23.209 --> 00:02:27.599
 unfortunately these children we 

00:02:24.810 --> 00:02:29.190
 They arrived very late, many arrived 

00:02:27.599 --> 00:02:31.220
 very complicated times when it was already 

00:02:29.190 --> 00:02:34.260
 hard to do much for them smoke and 

00:02:31.220 --> 00:02:35.879
 who is serving 14 years of having 

00:02:34.260 --> 00:02:37.830
 been founded and we have dedicated ourselves 

00:02:35.879 --> 00:02:40.200
 during all these years to do 

00:02:37.830 --> 00:02:41.940
 dissemination about these diseases with the 

00:02:40.200 --> 00:02:44.970
 mission to get these children 

00:02:41.940 --> 00:02:46.860
 survive and have a normal life but 

00:02:44.970 --> 00:02:48.420
 that they do train doctors to the 

00:02:46.860 --> 00:02:50.459
 we do we do one side 

00:02:48.420 --> 00:02:52.110
 especially diffusion with the doctor of 

00:02:50.459 --> 00:02:54.239
 first contact with pediatricians and 

00:02:52.110 --> 00:02:56.879
 general doctors through we make them 

00:02:54.239 --> 00:02:59.640
 courses where we teach them to tackle and 

00:02:56.879 --> 00:03:01.560
 say to think systematically how 

00:02:59.640 --> 00:03:03.690
 rule out the very common problems 

00:03:01.560 --> 00:03:05.129
 that cause infections until the case of 

00:03:03.690 --> 00:03:06.840
 the primary immunodeficiencies how 

00:03:05.129 --> 00:03:08.160
 communicate with us to be able to 

00:03:06.840 --> 00:03:10.620
 support to do more tests 

00:03:08.160 --> 00:03:12.269
 Sophisticated diagnostics and especially 

00:03:10.620 --> 00:03:14.730
 how to access treatment and this has 

00:03:12.269 --> 00:03:16.260
 generated that recent years in a 

00:03:14.730 --> 00:03:17.849
 last time especially ten years 

00:03:16.260 --> 00:03:20.250
 that we have worked very intensely in 

00:03:17.849 --> 00:03:21.840
 broadcast by then we always do 

00:03:20.250 --> 00:03:24.120
 a course for doctors we also do 

00:03:21.840 --> 00:03:26.669
 an information campaign to the public in 

00:03:24.120 --> 00:03:27.959
 general where we communicate the signals of 

00:03:26.669 --> 00:03:29.609
 alarm 

00:03:27.959 --> 00:03:34.290
 for moms to press their 

00:03:29.609 --> 00:03:36.239
 doctors can have this law and that can 

00:03:34.290 --> 00:03:38.489
 be easily diagnosed and then 

00:03:36.239 --> 00:03:41.099
 On the one hand, we educate the general public 

00:03:38.489 --> 00:03:43.650
 to moms and dads and on the other hand to 

00:03:41.099 --> 00:03:45.660
 the doctors of first contact and this has 

00:03:43.650 --> 00:03:47.340
 generated that fortunately the 

00:03:45.660 --> 00:03:50.579
 diagnosis has increased a lot in the 

00:03:47.340 --> 00:03:52.590
 last years and that we start to have 

00:03:50.579 --> 00:03:55.380
 every day more children well diagnosed and 

00:03:52.590 --> 00:03:57.180
 earlier 3 has a campaign to the 

00:03:55.380 --> 00:03:59.489
 ball is in your court has half 

00:03:57.180 --> 00:04:00.900
 ideas and as a temple I say with pleasure 

00:03:59.489 --> 00:04:03.299
 that we have achieved every day more 

00:04:00.900 --> 00:04:04.590
 diagnoses unfortunately not all 

00:04:03.299 --> 00:04:08.430
 children have access to 

00:04:04.590 --> 00:04:10.799
 top-level treatments these 

00:04:08.430 --> 00:04:13.079
 diseases are covered by our 

00:04:10.799 --> 00:04:16.079
 popular insurance are covered by the 

00:04:13.079 --> 00:04:17.430
 social security however today 

00:04:16.079 --> 00:04:19.709
 children not all children have 

00:04:17.430 --> 00:04:21.660
 access to medications 

00:04:19.709 --> 00:04:23.550
 half of these children require the 

00:04:21.660 --> 00:04:25.169
 replacement of these antibodies 

00:04:23.550 --> 00:04:26.370
 defenses that produce our system 

00:04:25.169 --> 00:04:29.580
 immune 

00:04:26.370 --> 00:04:31.910
 and they are not always accessible only 

00:04:29.580 --> 00:04:34.740
 Third level care hospitals 

00:04:31.910 --> 00:04:36.510
 hospitals where they have done very well the 

00:04:34.740 --> 00:04:39.030
 work for insurance reimbursement 

00:04:36.510 --> 00:04:40.410
 popular are hospitals that access the 

00:04:39.030 --> 00:04:43.139
 immunoglobulin which are antibodies 

00:04:40.410 --> 00:04:45.360
 they are put to these children and in the 

00:04:43.139 --> 00:04:46.979
 social security for example where you should 

00:04:45.360 --> 00:04:50.270
 make your obligation to have the best 

00:04:46.979 --> 00:04:52.770
 available treatment only have 

00:04:50.270 --> 00:04:55.800
 doses that are never with are never 

00:04:52.770 --> 00:04:58.979
 sufficient and of the antibodies of the 

00:04:55.800 --> 00:05:01.020
 immunoglobulins that are older 

00:04:58.979 --> 00:05:03.510
 that have more secondary and that 

00:05:01.020 --> 00:05:05.400
 take much longer to melt in such 

00:05:03.510 --> 00:05:08.639
 way that we are working with 

00:05:05.400 --> 00:05:10.380
 our authorities to get it to 

00:05:08.639 --> 00:05:13.139
 increase the age of the popular insurance covers 

00:05:10.380 --> 00:05:14.970
 up to 10 years in the administration 

00:05:13.139 --> 00:05:16.410
 of immunoglobulins but these videos 

00:05:14.970 --> 00:05:18.360
 they require life-long treatment 

00:05:16.410 --> 00:05:21.090
 to have a healthy life and a life 

00:05:18.360 --> 00:05:23.430
 productive and a normal life and not 

00:05:21.090 --> 00:05:25.440
 We can treat them well from the 

00:05:23.430 --> 00:05:27.270
 the year on various days then at 10 

00:05:25.440 --> 00:05:29.580
 years to take away the treaty of west 

00:05:27.270 --> 00:05:31.510
 then this one of the ball is in its 

00:05:29.580 --> 00:05:34.260
 court is invited to everything 

00:05:31.510 --> 00:05:36.940
 to have a timely diagnosis 

00:05:34.260 --> 00:05:39.580
 that gives an accessible treatment as 

00:05:36.940 --> 00:05:41.880
 how can we support good from the point 

00:05:39.580 --> 00:05:44.460
 of society in general 

00:05:41.880 --> 00:05:46.390
 knowing about these diseases 

00:05:44.460 --> 00:05:49.240
 communicating it if they know someone who 

00:05:46.390 --> 00:05:50.950
 have a similar picture of course 

00:05:49.240 --> 00:05:52.810
 helping us as volunteers or with 

00:05:50.950 --> 00:05:55.150
 economic contributions to make 

00:05:52.810 --> 00:05:57.190
 our work through the page of 

00:05:55.150 --> 00:05:59.980
 fumen internet and that they smoke and point 

00:05:57.190 --> 00:06:02.770
 herex point mx where everything is 

00:05:59.980 --> 00:06:04.990
 we do where dads or patients 

00:06:02.770 --> 00:06:06.580
 you can find an immunologist there is a 

00:06:04.990 --> 00:06:08.200
 directory of immunologists throughout 

00:06:06.580 --> 00:06:09.790
 country which makes us have to 

00:06:08.200 --> 00:06:12.280
 move we have made a national network 

00:06:09.790 --> 00:06:13.660
 of very pretty monologues that allows 

00:06:12.280 --> 00:06:16.030
 that we can work and that the patient 

00:06:13.660 --> 00:06:17.740
 do not have to move and of course 

00:06:16.030 --> 00:06:19.120
 through donations where he also 

00:06:17.740 --> 00:06:20.860
 can do directly through 

00:06:19.120 --> 00:06:22.540
 our website all of them 

00:06:20.860 --> 00:06:24.880
 are tax deductible smoke and 

00:06:22.540 --> 00:06:27.070
 authorized donated canada that counts 

00:06:24.880 --> 00:06:28.690
 with all the authorizations and point or 

00:06:27.070 --> 00:06:30.790
 heretic point 

00:06:28.690 --> 00:06:32.980
 let's put it to our pages 

00:06:30.790 --> 00:06:35.139
 Dr. Francisco tubs Excélsior 

00:06:32.980 --> 00:06:38.259
 very many thank you very much 

00:06:35.139 --> 00:06:40.360
 Thank you very much and remember that news 

00:06:38.259 --> 00:06:42.099
 there's always going to be the important thing is how 

00:06:40.360 --> 00:06:46.379
 it is informed do it by excélsior 

00:06:42.099 --> 00:06:46.379
 television news that say more
