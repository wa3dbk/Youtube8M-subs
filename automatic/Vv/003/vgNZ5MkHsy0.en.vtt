play character I'm happy disease i do
either<00:02:16.130> lies<00:02:16.400> and<00:02:16.700> that's<00:02:16.790> partly<00:02:17.690> because<00:02:17.750> of

00:02:18.040 --> 00:02:18.050 
either lies and that's partly because of

00:02:18.050 --> 00:02:19.870 
either lies and that's partly because of
how<00:02:18.260> her<00:02:18.410> inputs<00:02:18.800> work<00:02:19.040> I<00:02:19.220> think<00:02:19.520> it<00:02:19.700> can<00:02:19.850> be

00:02:19.870 --> 00:02:19.880 
how her inputs work I think it can be

00:02:19.880 --> 00:02:21.250 
how her inputs work I think it can be
annoying<00:02:20.180> to<00:02:20.360> play<00:02:20.540> a<00:02:20.569> character<00:02:20.810> where<00:02:21.170> you

00:02:21.250 --> 00:02:21.260 
annoying to play a character where you

00:02:21.260 --> 00:02:22.930
