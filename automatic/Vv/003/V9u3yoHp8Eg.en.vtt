is<00:00:46.140> el<00:00:46.260> rock<00:00:46.469> that's<00:00:46.649> a<00:00:46.710> great<00:00:46.890> question

00:00:47.090 --> 00:00:47.100 
is el rock that's a great question

00:00:47.100 --> 00:00:49.040 
is el rock that's a great question
sounds<00:00:47.969> like<00:00:48.059> one<00:00:48.270> camera<00:00:48.719> lunar

00:00:49.040 --> 00:00:49.050 
sounds like one camera lunar

00:00:49.050 --> 00:00:50.779 
sounds like one camera lunar
reconnaissance<00:00:49.170> orbiter<00:00:49.680> camera<00:00:50.129> but<00:00:50.670> it's

00:00:50.779 --> 00:00:50.789 
reconnaissance orbiter camera but it's

00:00:50.789 --> 00:00:52.670 
reconnaissance orbiter camera but it's
not<00:00:50.969> it's<00:00:51.300> actually<00:00:51.719> three<00:00:51.930> cameras<00:00:52.379> there's

00:00:52.670 --> 00:00:52.680 
not it's actually three cameras there's

00:00:52.680 --> 00:00:55.160 
not it's actually three cameras there's
two<00:00:53.129> identical<00:00:53.910> narrow<00:00:54.270> angle<00:00:54.449> cameras<00:00:55.020> are

00:00:55.160 --> 00:00:55.170 
two identical narrow angle cameras are

00:00:55.170 --> 00:00:56.959 
two identical narrow angle cameras are
very<00:00:55.440> high<00:00:55.590> resolution<00:00:55.770> that<00:00:56.280> pixels<00:00:56.699> about

00:00:56.959 --> 00:00:56.969 
very high resolution that pixels about

00:00:56.969 --> 00:00:59.840 
very high resolution that pixels about
this<00:00:57.210> big<00:00:57.480> 50<00:00:58.350> centimeters<00:00:58.890> and<00:00:59.100> it<00:00:59.699> was

00:00:59.840 --> 00:00:59.850 
this big 50 centimeters and it was

00:00:59.850 --> 00:01:01.760 
this big 50 centimeters and it was
designed<00:01:00.329> so<00:01:00.750> you<00:01:00.780> could<00:01:01.079> look<00:01:01.289> at<00:01:01.530> a<00:01:01.559> human

00:01:01.760 --> 00:01:01.770 
designed so you could look at a human

00:01:01.770 --> 00:01:04.219 
designed so you could look at a human
scale<00:01:02.190> on<00:01:02.520> the<00:01:02.670> surface<00:01:03.030> to<00:01:03.180> find<00:01:03.449> safe<00:01:03.930> and

00:01:04.219 --> 00:01:04.229 
scale on the surface to find safe and

00:01:04.229 --> 00:01:06.200 
scale on the surface to find safe and
engaging<00:01:04.530> landing<00:01:05.100> sites<00:01:05.339> then<00:01:05.939> there's<00:01:06.150> a

00:01:06.200 --> 00:01:06.210 
engaging landing sites then there's a

00:01:06.210 --> 00:01:07.880 
engaging landing sites then there's a
third<00:01:06.450> camera<00:01:06.720> wide-angle<00:01:07.409> camera<00:01:07.439> just

00:01:07.880 --> 00:01:07.890 
third camera wide-angle camera just

00:01:07.890 --> 00:01:10.039 
third camera wide-angle camera just
literally<00:01:08.310> about<00:01:08.580> this<00:01:08.790> big<00:01:09.030> it<00:01:09.450> Maps<00:01:09.750> the

00:01:10.039 --> 00:01:10.049 
literally about this big it Maps the

00:01:10.049 --> 00:01:12.380 
literally about this big it Maps the
moon<00:01:10.260> and<00:01:10.619> UV<00:01:11.040> and<00:01:11.159> visible<00:01:11.250> wavelengths<00:01:12.240> and

00:01:12.380 --> 00:01:12.390 
moon and UV and visible wavelengths and

00:01:12.390 --> 00:01:14.000 
moon and UV and visible wavelengths and
its<00:01:12.510> key<00:01:12.750> purpose<00:01:13.140> is<00:01:13.350> to<00:01:13.590> look<00:01:13.860> at

00:01:14.000 --> 00:01:14.010 
its key purpose is to look at

00:01:14.010 --> 00:01:15.770 
its key purpose is to look at
compositional<00:01:14.700> differences<00:01:15.240> for<00:01:15.570> both

00:01:15.770 --> 00:01:15.780 
compositional differences for both

00:01:15.780 --> 00:01:23.320 
compositional differences for both
scientific<00:01:16.530> and<00:01:16.700> resource<00:01:17.700> evaluation

00:01:23.320 --> 00:01:23.330 

00:01:23.330 --> 00:01:26.030 

it's<00:01:24.330> not<00:01:24.510> easy<00:01:24.720> to<00:01:25.050> find<00:01:25.200> new<00:01:25.470> impact<00:01:25.680> craters

00:01:26.030 --> 00:01:26.040 
it's not easy to find new impact craters

00:01:26.040 --> 00:01:28.010 
it's not easy to find new impact craters
because<00:01:26.370> most<00:01:26.670> of<00:01:26.790> them<00:01:26.970> are<00:01:27.090> very<00:01:27.240> small<00:01:27.570> the

00:01:28.010 --> 00:01:28.020 
because most of them are very small the

00:01:28.020 --> 00:01:29.900 
because most of them are very small the
only<00:01:28.230> way<00:01:28.320> we<00:01:28.500> can<00:01:28.650> really<00:01:28.920> do<00:01:29.190> this<00:01:29.430> is<00:01:29.700> we

00:01:29.900 --> 00:01:29.910 
only way we can really do this is we

00:01:29.910 --> 00:01:31.640 
only way we can really do this is we
have<00:01:30.060> a<00:01:30.090> before<00:01:30.570> image<00:01:30.750> and<00:01:31.200> an<00:01:31.290> after<00:01:31.620> image

00:01:31.640 --> 00:01:31.650 
have a before image and an after image

00:01:31.650 --> 00:01:33.380 
have a before image and an after image
and<00:01:32.130> we've<00:01:32.370> been<00:01:32.490> in<00:01:32.580> orbit<00:01:32.760> for<00:01:32.910> four<00:01:33.240> years

00:01:33.380 --> 00:01:33.390 
and we've been in orbit for four years

00:01:33.390 --> 00:01:35.390 
and we've been in orbit for four years
now<00:01:33.540> so<00:01:34.080> what<00:01:34.470> we're<00:01:34.620> doing<00:01:34.650> now<00:01:35.010> is<00:01:35.130> we're

00:01:35.390 --> 00:01:35.400 
now so what we're doing now is we're

00:01:35.400 --> 00:01:37.130 
now so what we're doing now is we're
going<00:01:35.610> back<00:01:35.850> images<00:01:36.390> that<00:01:36.570> were<00:01:36.660> taken<00:01:37.020> in<00:01:37.110> the

00:01:37.130 --> 00:01:37.140 
going back images that were taken in the

00:01:37.140 --> 00:01:38.870 
going back images that were taken in the
first<00:01:37.200> year<00:01:37.680> or<00:01:37.770> two<00:01:37.800> put<00:01:38.250> them<00:01:38.369> on<00:01:38.430> a<00:01:38.490> computer

00:01:38.870 --> 00:01:38.880 
first year or two put them on a computer

00:01:38.880 --> 00:01:40.880 
first year or two put them on a computer
screen<00:01:38.910> and<00:01:39.360> blink<00:01:39.990> them<00:01:40.170> and<00:01:40.200> then<00:01:40.800> it

00:01:40.880 --> 00:01:40.890 
screen and blink them and then it

00:01:40.890 --> 00:01:42.800 
screen and blink them and then it
becomes<00:01:41.100> really<00:01:41.369> obvious<00:01:41.970> oh<00:01:42.119> look<00:01:42.510> there's<00:01:42.750> a

00:01:42.800 --> 00:01:42.810 
becomes really obvious oh look there's a

00:01:42.810 --> 00:01:44.150 
becomes really obvious oh look there's a
new<00:01:42.900> crater<00:01:43.140> there<00:01:43.320> because<00:01:43.650> it<00:01:43.770> wasn't<00:01:44.040> in

00:01:44.150 --> 00:01:44.160 
new crater there because it wasn't in

00:01:44.160 --> 00:01:45.830 
new crater there because it wasn't in
the<00:01:44.220> before<00:01:44.700> it's<00:01:45.000> in<00:01:45.119> the<00:01:45.180> after<00:01:45.630> before

00:01:45.830 --> 00:01:45.840 
the before it's in the after before

00:01:45.840 --> 00:01:47.900 
the before it's in the after before
after<00:01:46.229> and<00:01:46.470> we<00:01:46.710> call<00:01:46.920> these<00:01:47.070> temporal<00:01:47.580> pairs

00:01:47.900 --> 00:01:47.910 
after and we call these temporal pairs

00:01:47.910 --> 00:01:50.359 
after and we call these temporal pairs
so<00:01:48.720> now<00:01:48.869> we<00:01:48.930> have<00:01:49.050> several<00:01:49.440> thousand<00:01:50.070> pairs

00:01:50.359 --> 00:01:50.369 
so now we have several thousand pairs

00:01:50.369 --> 00:01:53.030 
so now we have several thousand pairs
and<00:01:50.760> to<00:01:51.479> sit<00:01:51.690> down<00:01:51.900> and<00:01:52.200> look<00:01:52.320> at<00:01:52.440> every<00:01:52.800> single

00:01:53.030 --> 00:01:53.040 
and to sit down and look at every single

00:01:53.040 --> 00:01:55.040 
and to sit down and look at every single
pixel<00:01:53.460> and<00:01:53.850> all<00:01:54.119> those<00:01:54.270> images<00:01:54.600> would

00:01:55.040 --> 00:01:55.050 
pixel and all those images would

00:01:55.050 --> 00:01:56.900 
pixel and all those images would
probably<00:01:55.410> take<00:01:55.560> one<00:01:55.740> person<00:01:56.190> you<00:01:56.310> know<00:01:56.430> 10<00:01:56.700> or

00:01:56.900 --> 00:01:56.910 
probably take one person you know 10 or

00:01:56.910 --> 00:01:59.210 
probably take one person you know 10 or
20<00:01:57.210> or<00:01:57.240> 30<00:01:57.540> years<00:01:57.840> so<00:01:58.470> we<00:01:58.530> started<00:01:58.800> working<00:01:58.920> on

00:01:59.210 --> 00:01:59.220 
20 or 30 years so we started working on

00:01:59.220 --> 00:02:01.070 
20 or 30 years so we started working on
an<00:01:59.369> algorithm<00:01:59.910> or<00:02:00.090> computer<00:02:00.660> program<00:02:01.050> that

00:02:01.070 --> 00:02:01.080 
an algorithm or computer program that

00:02:01.080 --> 00:02:03.800 
an algorithm or computer program that
searches<00:02:01.830> the<00:02:02.670> images<00:02:03.060> by<00:02:03.180> using<00:02:03.420> a<00:02:03.600> little

00:02:03.800 --> 00:02:03.810 
searches the images by using a little

00:02:03.810 --> 00:02:05.719 
searches the images by using a little
template<00:02:04.200> that<00:02:04.410> before<00:02:04.680> and<00:02:04.830> after<00:02:05.100> pairs<00:02:05.430> and

00:02:05.719 --> 00:02:05.729 
template that before and after pairs and

00:02:05.729 --> 00:02:08.449 
template that before and after pairs and
it<00:02:06.090> automatically<00:02:06.810> finds<00:02:07.380> them<00:02:07.560> it<00:02:08.070> gets<00:02:08.250> like

00:02:08.449 --> 00:02:08.459 
it automatically finds them it gets like

00:02:08.459 --> 00:02:10.760 
it automatically finds them it gets like
about<00:02:08.670> a<00:02:08.700> ninety<00:02:09.030> percent<00:02:09.179> success<00:02:09.630> rate<00:02:09.959> so

00:02:10.760 --> 00:02:10.770 
about a ninety percent success rate so

00:02:10.770 --> 00:02:13.100 
about a ninety percent success rate so
far<00:02:11.009> we<00:02:11.190> found<00:02:11.459> hundreds<00:02:12.060> of<00:02:12.300> changes<00:02:12.959> on

00:02:13.100 --> 00:02:13.110 
far we found hundreds of changes on

00:02:13.110 --> 00:02:15.229 
far we found hundreds of changes on
surface<00:02:13.650> many<00:02:14.310> of<00:02:14.489> them<00:02:14.640> are<00:02:14.760> too<00:02:14.910> small<00:02:15.180> to

00:02:15.229 --> 00:02:15.239 
surface many of them are too small to

00:02:15.239 --> 00:02:17.090 
surface many of them are too small to
really<00:02:15.510> know<00:02:15.690> for<00:02:15.720> sure<00:02:15.959> if<00:02:16.440> their<00:02:16.709> creators

00:02:17.090 --> 00:02:17.100 
really know for sure if their creators

00:02:17.100 --> 00:02:19.100 
really know for sure if their creators
or<00:02:17.340> if<00:02:17.550> their<00:02:17.700> secondary<00:02:18.060> creators<00:02:18.540> but<00:02:18.989> we

00:02:19.100 --> 00:02:19.110 
or if their secondary creators but we

00:02:19.110 --> 00:02:22.220 
or if their secondary creators but we
have<00:02:19.320> found<00:02:19.620> over<00:02:20.130> 25<00:02:20.910> they<00:02:21.360> were<00:02:21.480> absolutely

00:02:22.220 --> 00:02:22.230 
have found over 25 they were absolutely

00:02:22.230 --> 00:02:24.259 
have found over 25 they were absolutely
positively<00:02:22.830> confirmed<00:02:23.459> craters<00:02:23.850> you<00:02:23.970> can<00:02:24.120> see

00:02:24.259 --> 00:02:24.269 
positively confirmed craters you can see

00:02:24.269 --> 00:02:26.780 
positively confirmed craters you can see
the<00:02:24.390> rim<00:02:24.630> and<00:02:24.989> the<00:02:25.140> ejecta<00:02:25.709> and<00:02:25.950> we've<00:02:26.610> also

00:02:26.780 --> 00:02:26.790 
the rim and the ejecta and we've also

00:02:26.790 --> 00:02:28.610 
the rim and the ejecta and we've also
made<00:02:27.060> this<00:02:27.180> amazing<00:02:27.420> discovery<00:02:28.019> that<00:02:28.230> we<00:02:28.410> find

00:02:28.610 --> 00:02:28.620 
made this amazing discovery that we find

00:02:28.620 --> 00:02:37.130 
made this amazing discovery that we find
secondary<00:02:29.130> craters<00:02:29.549> related<00:02:35.930> there<00:02:36.930> was<00:02:37.110> a

00:02:37.130 --> 00:02:37.140 
secondary craters related there was a

00:02:37.140 --> 00:02:39.470 
secondary craters related there was a
bright<00:02:37.890> flash<00:02:37.950> that<00:02:38.580> was<00:02:38.700> recorded<00:02:39.030> by<00:02:39.450> a

00:02:39.470 --> 00:02:39.480 
bright flash that was recorded by a

00:02:39.480 --> 00:02:41.360 
bright flash that was recorded by a
video<00:02:39.780> camera<00:02:40.200> by<00:02:40.560> team<00:02:40.860> at<00:02:41.010> Marshall<00:02:41.340> Space

00:02:41.360 --> 00:02:41.370 
video camera by team at Marshall Space

00:02:41.370 --> 00:02:43.160 
video camera by team at Marshall Space
Flight<00:02:41.580> Center<00:02:41.790> and<00:02:42.450> it<00:02:42.570> was<00:02:42.660> a<00:02:42.690> bright<00:02:42.989> flash

00:02:43.160 --> 00:02:43.170 
Flight Center and it was a bright flash

00:02:43.170 --> 00:02:45.620 
Flight Center and it was a bright flash
they<00:02:43.650> recorded<00:02:44.220> so<00:02:44.459> it<00:02:44.549> must<00:02:44.790> be<00:02:44.940> there<00:02:45.299> for

00:02:45.620 --> 00:02:45.630 
they recorded so it must be there for

00:02:45.630 --> 00:02:47.420 
they recorded so it must be there for
one<00:02:46.049> of<00:02:46.140> the<00:02:46.200> biggest<00:02:46.380> craters<00:02:46.799> and<00:02:47.160> so

00:02:47.420 --> 00:02:47.430 
one of the biggest craters and so

00:02:47.430 --> 00:02:49.340 
one of the biggest craters and so
they're<00:02:47.610> really<00:02:47.970> interested<00:02:48.239> for<00:02:48.840> us<00:02:48.989> to<00:02:49.170> take

00:02:49.340 --> 00:02:49.350 
they're really interested for us to take

00:02:49.350 --> 00:02:51.140 
they're really interested for us to take
a<00:02:49.380> picture<00:02:49.650> can<00:02:50.310> you<00:02:50.340> see<00:02:50.579> the<00:02:50.700> crater<00:02:50.970> because

00:02:51.140 --> 00:02:51.150 
a picture can you see the crater because

00:02:51.150 --> 00:02:52.490 
a picture can you see the crater because
they<00:02:51.299> predicted<00:02:51.780> how<00:02:51.870> big<00:02:52.079> it<00:02:52.200> was<00:02:52.230> going<00:02:52.440> to

00:02:52.490 --> 00:02:52.500 
they predicted how big it was going to

00:02:52.500 --> 00:02:54.319 
they predicted how big it was going to
be<00:02:52.680> based<00:02:53.010> on<00:02:53.250> the<00:02:53.400> energy<00:02:53.519> and<00:02:54.000> but<00:02:54.120> this<00:02:54.239> is

00:02:54.319 --> 00:02:54.329 
be based on the energy and but this is

00:02:54.329 --> 00:02:55.699 
be based on the energy and but this is
all<00:02:54.480> a<00:02:54.510> model<00:02:54.930> so<00:02:55.110> it's<00:02:55.230> a<00:02:55.290> great<00:02:55.440> opportunity

00:02:55.699 --> 00:02:55.709 
all a model so it's a great opportunity

00:02:55.709 --> 00:02:58.370 
all a model so it's a great opportunity
to<00:02:56.100> actually<00:02:56.760> calibrate<00:02:57.390> their<00:02:57.570> model<00:02:57.900> so<00:02:58.260> we

00:02:58.370 --> 00:02:58.380 
to actually calibrate their model so we

00:02:58.380 --> 00:02:59.630 
to actually calibrate their model so we
took<00:02:58.500> a<00:02:58.560> picture<00:02:58.829> sounded<00:02:59.370> on<00:02:59.489> their

00:02:59.630 --> 00:02:59.640 
took a picture sounded on their

00:02:59.640 --> 00:03:02.120 
took a picture sounded on their
coordinates<00:03:00.090> and<00:03:00.350> we<00:03:01.350> didn't<00:03:01.620> find<00:03:01.799> a<00:03:01.860> crater

00:03:02.120 --> 00:03:02.130 
coordinates and we didn't find a crater

00:03:02.130 --> 00:03:03.949 
coordinates and we didn't find a crater
we<00:03:02.519> found<00:03:02.760> these<00:03:02.910> enigmatic<00:03:03.239> little

00:03:03.949 --> 00:03:03.959 
we found these enigmatic little

00:03:03.959 --> 00:03:06.160 
we found these enigmatic little
splotches<00:03:04.440> there<00:03:05.220> was<00:03:05.370> something

00:03:06.160 --> 00:03:06.170 
splotches there was something

00:03:06.170 --> 00:03:09.020 
splotches there was something
disturbance<00:03:07.170> of<00:03:07.290> the<00:03:07.350> soil<00:03:07.680> that<00:03:08.519> wasn't<00:03:08.940> in

00:03:09.020 --> 00:03:09.030 
disturbance of the soil that wasn't in

00:03:09.030 --> 00:03:10.520 
disturbance of the soil that wasn't in
the<00:03:09.180> original<00:03:09.269> image<00:03:09.720> but<00:03:10.230> we<00:03:10.290> didn't<00:03:10.470> know

00:03:10.520 --> 00:03:10.530 
the original image but we didn't know

00:03:10.530 --> 00:03:12.410 
the original image but we didn't know
what<00:03:10.650> it<00:03:10.769> was<00:03:10.890> so<00:03:11.610> we<00:03:11.640> thought<00:03:11.940> okay<00:03:12.239> well

00:03:12.410 --> 00:03:12.420 
what it was so we thought okay well

00:03:12.420 --> 00:03:13.430 
what it was so we thought okay well
they're<00:03:12.570> coordinates<00:03:12.870> were<00:03:13.049> off<00:03:13.110> a<00:03:13.170> little

00:03:13.430 --> 00:03:13.440 
they're coordinates were off a little

00:03:13.440 --> 00:03:14.780 
they're coordinates were off a little
bit<00:03:13.620> because<00:03:13.799> they're<00:03:14.010> pixels<00:03:14.430> are<00:03:14.549> really

00:03:14.780 --> 00:03:14.790 
bit because they're pixels are really

00:03:14.790 --> 00:03:16.819 
bit because they're pixels are really
big<00:03:15.030> from<00:03:15.570> the<00:03:15.690> camera<00:03:16.079> back<00:03:16.260> there<00:03:16.290> pixels

00:03:16.819 --> 00:03:16.829 
big from the camera back there pixels

00:03:16.829 --> 00:03:18.410 
big from the camera back there pixels
are<00:03:16.950> bigger<00:03:17.130> than<00:03:17.250> our<00:03:17.489> image<00:03:17.820> footprints

00:03:18.410 --> 00:03:18.420 
are bigger than our image footprints

00:03:18.420 --> 00:03:20.810 
are bigger than our image footprints
s'okay<00:03:19.380> no<00:03:19.590> problem<00:03:19.890> we'll<00:03:20.010> move<00:03:20.160> over<00:03:20.549> to<00:03:20.730> the

00:03:20.810 --> 00:03:20.820 
s'okay no problem we'll move over to the

00:03:20.820 --> 00:03:22.400 
s'okay no problem we'll move over to the
west<00:03:21.000> and<00:03:21.299> we'll<00:03:21.390> take<00:03:21.600> out<00:03:21.750> you<00:03:22.200> know<00:03:22.290> we're

00:03:22.400 --> 00:03:22.410 
west and we'll take out you know we're

00:03:22.410 --> 00:03:24.500 
west and we'll take out you know we're
building<00:03:22.680> up<00:03:22.709> with<00:03:22.860> mosaic<00:03:23.190> so<00:03:24.090> next<00:03:24.269> month

00:03:24.500 --> 00:03:24.510 
building up with mosaic so next month

00:03:24.510 --> 00:03:26.509 
building up with mosaic so next month
comes<00:03:24.750> around<00:03:25.049> we<00:03:25.170> take<00:03:25.350> a<00:03:25.380> picture<00:03:25.739> and<00:03:26.100> we<00:03:26.430> do

00:03:26.509 --> 00:03:26.519 
comes around we take a picture and we do

00:03:26.519 --> 00:03:27.860 
comes around we take a picture and we do
the<00:03:26.640> same<00:03:26.820> thing<00:03:27.090> look<00:03:27.269> at<00:03:27.360> the<00:03:27.480> before<00:03:27.840> look

00:03:27.860 --> 00:03:27.870 
the same thing look at the before look

00:03:27.870 --> 00:03:29.750 
the same thing look at the before look
at<00:03:28.170> the<00:03:28.230> after<00:03:28.319> image<00:03:28.739> no<00:03:29.190> crane

00:03:29.750 --> 00:03:29.760 
at the after image no crane

00:03:29.760 --> 00:03:32.750 
at the after image no crane
but<00:03:30.390> more<00:03:30.569> of<00:03:30.689> these<00:03:30.780> splotches<00:03:31.159> but<00:03:32.159> also<00:03:32.340> in

00:03:32.750 --> 00:03:32.760 
but more of these splotches but also in

00:03:32.760 --> 00:03:35.390 
but more of these splotches but also in
that<00:03:32.909> image<00:03:33.120> we<00:03:33.239> saw<00:03:33.569> what<00:03:34.140> looked<00:03:34.170> like<00:03:34.470> very

00:03:35.390 --> 00:03:35.400 
that image we saw what looked like very

00:03:35.400 --> 00:03:38.449 
that image we saw what looked like very
faint<00:03:35.760> rays<00:03:36.120> and<00:03:36.739> why<00:03:37.739> I<00:03:37.769> wonder<00:03:38.069> if<00:03:38.220> those<00:03:38.310> are

00:03:38.449 --> 00:03:38.459 
faint rays and why I wonder if those are

00:03:38.459 --> 00:03:40.550 
faint rays and why I wonder if those are
actually<00:03:38.700> reads<00:03:38.939> from<00:03:39.180> a<00:03:39.329> greater<00:03:39.569> so<00:03:40.110> we<00:03:40.230> just

00:03:40.550 --> 00:03:40.560 
actually reads from a greater so we just

00:03:40.560 --> 00:03:42.380 
actually reads from a greater so we just
did<00:03:40.860> the<00:03:40.950> simple<00:03:41.250> exercise<00:03:41.700> of<00:03:41.819> drawing<00:03:42.180> lines

00:03:42.380 --> 00:03:42.390 
did the simple exercise of drawing lines

00:03:42.390 --> 00:03:45.380 
did the simple exercise of drawing lines
and<00:03:42.840> see<00:03:42.989> where<00:03:43.140> they<00:03:43.260> converge<00:03:43.799> and<00:03:44.159> then<00:03:45.060> so

00:03:45.380 --> 00:03:45.390 
and see where they converge and then so

00:03:45.390 --> 00:03:46.670 
and see where they converge and then so
the<00:03:45.510> next<00:03:45.659> month<00:03:45.930> it<00:03:46.079> came<00:03:46.230> around<00:03:46.379> remember

00:03:46.670 --> 00:03:46.680 
the next month it came around remember

00:03:46.680 --> 00:03:48.530 
the next month it came around remember
this<00:03:46.799> is<00:03:46.980> the<00:03:47.069> third<00:03:47.250> opportunity<00:03:47.909> we<00:03:48.180> Center

00:03:48.530 --> 00:03:48.540 
this is the third opportunity we Center

00:03:48.540 --> 00:03:50.000 
this is the third opportunity we Center
they<00:03:48.780> fail<00:03:48.959> to<00:03:48.989> view<00:03:49.200> the<00:03:49.290> camera<00:03:49.590> right<00:03:49.769> on

00:03:50.000 --> 00:03:50.010 
they fail to view the camera right on

00:03:50.010 --> 00:03:51.949 
they fail to view the camera right on
that<00:03:50.220> latitude<00:03:50.760> longitude<00:03:50.909> boom<00:03:51.690> take

00:03:51.949 --> 00:03:51.959 
that latitude longitude boom take

00:03:51.959 --> 00:03:54.080 
that latitude longitude boom take
another<00:03:52.170> picture<00:03:52.409> comes<00:03:53.280> down<00:03:53.519> and<00:03:53.760> there<00:03:53.970> it

00:03:54.080 --> 00:03:54.090 
another picture comes down and there it

00:03:54.090 --> 00:03:56.599 
another picture comes down and there it
is<00:03:54.239> beautiful<00:03:55.110> 18<00:03:55.500> meter<00:03:55.739> diameter<00:03:55.980> crater

00:03:56.599 --> 00:03:56.609 
is beautiful 18 meter diameter crater

00:03:56.609 --> 00:03:58.789 
is beautiful 18 meter diameter crater
then<00:03:57.569> we<00:03:57.659> started<00:03:57.930> looking<00:03:58.260> at<00:03:58.349> now<00:03:58.500> we've<00:03:58.650> got

00:03:58.789 --> 00:03:58.799 
then we started looking at now we've got

00:03:58.799 --> 00:04:00.800 
then we started looking at now we've got
three<00:03:59.099> of<00:03:59.220> these<00:03:59.370> and<00:03:59.760> there's<00:03:59.909> hundreds<00:04:00.689> of

00:04:00.800 --> 00:04:00.810 
three of these and there's hundreds of

00:04:00.810 --> 00:04:02.420 
three of these and there's hundreds of
these<00:04:00.989> little<00:04:01.140> splotches<00:04:01.500> than<00:04:01.890> refining

00:04:02.420 --> 00:04:02.430 
these little splotches than refining

00:04:02.430 --> 00:04:04.399 
these little splotches than refining
he's<00:04:03.000> raised<00:04:03.390> and<00:04:03.810> then<00:04:03.900> we<00:04:04.019> have<00:04:04.140> the<00:04:04.260> big

00:04:04.399 --> 00:04:04.409 
he's raised and then we have the big

00:04:04.409 --> 00:04:06.259 
he's raised and then we have the big
picture<00:04:04.680> we<00:04:05.310> could<00:04:05.489> see<00:04:05.670> that<00:04:05.700> the<00:04:05.970> splotches

00:04:06.259 --> 00:04:06.269 
picture we could see that the splotches

00:04:06.269 --> 00:04:08.899 
picture we could see that the splotches
are<00:04:06.930> actually<00:04:07.530> lined<00:04:07.829> up<00:04:08.099> these<00:04:08.549> very<00:04:08.790> small

00:04:08.899 --> 00:04:08.909 
are actually lined up these very small

00:04:08.909 --> 00:04:12.110 
are actually lined up these very small
clods<00:04:09.780> of<00:04:10.230> ejecta<00:04:10.680> we're<00:04:10.829> thrown<00:04:11.099> out<00:04:11.280> 10<00:04:11.579> 20

00:04:12.110 --> 00:04:12.120 
clods of ejecta we're thrown out 10 20

00:04:12.120 --> 00:04:14.869 
clods of ejecta we're thrown out 10 20
30<00:04:12.420> kilometers<00:04:13.349> away<00:04:13.500> that's<00:04:13.889> 30,000<00:04:14.760> meters

00:04:14.869 --> 00:04:14.879 
30 kilometers away that's 30,000 meters

00:04:14.879 --> 00:04:17.420 
30 kilometers away that's 30,000 meters
compared<00:04:15.569> to<00:04:15.720> an<00:04:15.780> 18<00:04:16.199> meter<00:04:16.590> diameter<00:04:16.829> crater

00:04:17.420 --> 00:04:17.430 
compared to an 18 meter diameter crater

00:04:17.430 --> 00:04:21.139 
compared to an 18 meter diameter crater
so<00:04:17.789> it's<00:04:17.910> a<00:04:17.970> very<00:04:18.000> exciting<00:04:18.329> discovery
