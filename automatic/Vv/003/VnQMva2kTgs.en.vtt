chocolate<00:01:03.960> brown<00:01:04.229> so<00:01:04.880> we'll<00:01:05.880> deal<00:01:06.090> with<00:01:06.240> that

00:01:07.330 --> 00:01:07.340 
chocolate brown so we'll deal with that

00:01:07.340 --> 00:01:09.770 
chocolate brown so we'll deal with that
as<00:01:08.340> you<00:01:08.520> can<00:01:08.640> see<00:01:08.820> I<00:01:08.850> put<00:01:08.909> my<00:01:09.180> finger<00:01:09.479> out<00:01:09.510> on

00:01:09.770 --> 00:01:09.780 
as you can see I put my finger out on

00:01:09.780 --> 00:01:13.160 
as you can see I put my finger out on
there<00:01:09.990> I<00:01:10.340> got<00:01:11.340> the<00:01:11.479> 1786<00:01:12.479> pattern<00:01:12.930> cuz<00:01:13.049> my

00:01:13.160 --> 00:01:13.170 
there I got the 1786 pattern cuz my

00:01:13.170 --> 00:01:16.190 
there I got the 1786 pattern cuz my
other<00:01:13.290> custom<00:01:13.799> is<00:01:14.220> TP<00:01:15.030> 15<00:01:15.450> so<00:01:15.720> I<00:01:15.750> thought<00:01:16.049> I'd

00:01:16.190 --> 00:01:16.200 
other custom is TP 15 so I thought I'd

00:01:16.200 --> 00:01:20.660 
other custom is TP 15 so I thought I'd
try<00:01:17.100> this<00:01:17.340> pattern<00:01:17.759> and<00:01:18.000> the<00:01:18.540> reason<00:01:19.670> another

00:01:20.660 --> 00:01:20.670 
try this pattern and the reason another

00:01:20.670 --> 00:01:25.010 
try this pattern and the reason another
custom<00:01:21.240> is<00:01:21.540> because<00:01:23.479> change<00:01:24.479> teams<00:01:24.810> this<00:01:24.960> year

00:01:25.010 --> 00:01:25.020 
custom is because change teams this year

00:01:25.020 --> 00:01:28.310 
custom is because change teams this year
and<00:01:25.610> this<00:01:26.610> team<00:01:26.850> hasn't<00:01:27.030> blue<00:01:27.360> anymore<00:01:27.600> so<00:01:28.110> it

00:01:28.310 --> 00:01:28.320 
and this team hasn't blue anymore so it

00:01:28.320 --> 00:01:29.510 
and this team hasn't blue anymore so it
looked<00:01:28.530> weird<00:01:28.680> out<00:01:28.950> there<00:01:28.979> with<00:01:29.250> the<00:01:29.340> blue

00:01:29.510 --> 00:01:29.520 
looked weird out there with the blue

00:01:29.520 --> 00:01:32.569 
looked weird out there with the blue
