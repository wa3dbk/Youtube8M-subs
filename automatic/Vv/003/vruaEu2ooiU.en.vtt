00:00:22.419 --> 00:00:22.429 
parts we are it is a very fast car so if

00:00:22.429 --> 00:00:24.999 
parts we are it is a very fast car so if
you're<00:00:22.580> looking<00:00:22.699> for<00:00:23.089> a<00:00:23.150> good<00:00:23.330> fast<00:00:24.009> that's

you're looking for a good fast that's

00:00:25.009 --> 00:00:27.569 
you're looking for a good fast that's
your<00:00:25.279> car<00:00:25.550> I'd<00:00:26.060> definitely<00:00:26.720> recommend<00:00:26.839> this

00:00:27.569 --> 00:00:27.579 
your car I'd definitely recommend this

00:00:27.579 --> 00:00:31.659 
your car I'd definitely recommend this
so<00:00:28.579> if<00:00:29.480> you<00:00:29.960> do<00:00:30.109> want<00:00:30.320> one<00:00:30.470> definitely<00:00:31.369> buy<00:00:31.519> one

so if you do want one definitely buy one

00:00:31.669 --> 00:00:33.910 
so if you do want one definitely buy one
of<00:00:31.699> these<00:00:31.909> instead<00:00:32.360> of<00:00:32.419> you<00:00:33.380> know<00:00:33.500> something

00:00:33.910 --> 00:00:33.920 
of these instead of you know something

00:00:33.920 --> 00:00:35.970 
of these instead of you know something
else

00:00:35.970 --> 00:00:35.980 
else

00:00:35.980 --> 00:00:38.560 
else
I've<00:00:36.980> got<00:00:37.190> slick<00:00:37.460> tires<00:00:37.790> on<00:00:38.030> at<00:00:38.150> the<00:00:38.240> minute

00:00:38.560 --> 00:00:38.570 
I've got slick tires on at the minute

00:00:38.570 --> 00:00:41.080 
I've got slick tires on at the minute
which<00:00:38.870> allows<00:00:39.530> here<00:00:39.950> if<00:00:40.190> the<00:00:40.550> ground<00:00:40.790> was<00:00:40.910> to

00:00:41.080 --> 00:00:41.090 
which allows here if the ground was to

00:00:41.090 --> 00:00:43.360 
which allows here if the ground was to
fight<00:00:41.330> damp<00:00:41.720> or<00:00:41.960> a<00:00:42.020> little<00:00:42.320> bit<00:00:42.470> wet<00:00:42.620> you<00:00:43.160> can

00:00:43.360 --> 00:00:43.370 
fight damp or a little bit wet you can

00:00:43.370 --> 00:00:44.860 
fight damp or a little bit wet you can
just<00:00:43.550> like<00:00:43.700> flick<00:00:44.000> the<00:00:44.180> tail<00:00:44.390> up<00:00:44.600> and<00:00:44.720> do<00:00:44.840> a

00:00:44.860 --> 00:00:44.870 
just like flick the tail up and do a

00:00:44.870 --> 00:00:46.420 
just like flick the tail up and do a
little<00:00:45.020> power<00:00:45.290> slide<00:00:45.650> and<00:00:45.860> then<00:00:45.980> it'll<00:00:46.160> just

00:00:46.420 --> 00:00:46.430 
little power slide and then it'll just

00:00:46.430 --> 00:00:47.790 
little power slide and then it'll just
come<00:00:46.610> to<00:00:46.790> a<00:00:46.820> stop

00:00:47.790 --> 00:00:47.800 
come to a stop

00:00:47.800 --> 00:00:49.870 
come to a stop
I'm<00:00:48.800> just<00:00:48.950> going<00:00:49.100> to<00:00:49.160> go<00:00:49.280> through<00:00:49.490> the<00:00:49.670> parts

00:00:49.870 --> 00:00:49.880 
I'm just going to go through the parts

00:00:49.880 --> 00:00:52.930 
I'm just going to go through the parts
with<00:00:50.180> you<00:00:50.390> that's<00:00:50.840> obviously<00:00:51.200> the<00:00:51.610> fuel<00:00:52.610> tank

00:00:52.930 --> 00:00:52.940 
with you that's obviously the fuel tank

00:00:52.940 --> 00:00:55.570 
with you that's obviously the fuel tank
you<00:00:53.000> put<00:00:53.270> the<00:00:53.360> fuel<00:00:53.600> in<00:00:53.630> that<00:00:53.980> press<00:00:54.980> that<00:00:55.250> and

00:00:55.570 --> 00:00:55.580 
you put the fuel in that press that and

00:00:55.580 --> 00:00:57.430 
you put the fuel in that press that and
then<00:00:55.790> it<00:00:56.060> sends<00:00:56.390> it<00:00:56.690> through<00:00:56.720> this<00:00:57.020> little<00:00:57.230> way

00:00:57.430 --> 00:00:57.440 
then it sends it through this little way

00:00:57.440 --> 00:01:00.460 
then it sends it through this little way
to<00:00:58.070> the<00:00:58.220> engine<00:00:58.940> which<00:00:59.690> then<00:00:59.900> allows<00:01:00.230> it<00:01:00.440> to

00:01:00.460 --> 00:01:00.470 
to the engine which then allows it to

00:01:00.470 --> 00:01:04.210 
to the engine which then allows it to
stop<00:01:01.340> and<00:01:02.240> then<00:01:02.570> you<00:01:02.870> pull<00:01:03.590> this<00:01:03.680> little<00:01:03.980> card

00:01:04.210 --> 00:01:04.220 
stop and then you pull this little card

00:01:04.220 --> 00:01:08.319 
stop and then you pull this little card
here<00:01:04.960> and<00:01:06.130> I<00:01:07.130> think<00:01:07.430> you<00:01:07.640> need<00:01:07.729> all<00:01:07.939> four

00:01:08.319 --> 00:01:08.329 
here and I think you need all four

00:01:08.329 --> 00:01:09.419 
here and I think you need all four
wheels<00:01:08.450> off<00:01:08.719> the<00:01:08.749> ground

00:01:09.419 --> 00:01:09.429 
wheels off the ground

00:01:09.429 --> 00:01:12.489 
wheels off the ground
you<00:01:10.429> pull<00:01:10.640> that<00:01:10.670> there<00:01:11.479> not<00:01:11.689> after<00:01:12.079> a<00:01:12.289> few

00:01:12.489 --> 00:01:12.499 
you pull that there not after a few

00:01:12.499 --> 00:01:14.859 
you pull that there not after a few
attempts<00:01:12.829> I'll<00:01:13.009> eventually<00:01:13.460> start<00:01:14.030> it<00:01:14.240> then

00:01:14.859 --> 00:01:14.869 
attempts I'll eventually start it then

00:01:14.869 --> 00:01:16.810 
attempts I'll eventually start it then
you<00:01:14.990> pull<00:01:15.200> the<00:01:15.380> starter<00:01:15.890> out<00:01:16.070> of<00:01:16.249> it<00:01:16.490> and<00:01:16.700> then

00:01:16.810 --> 00:01:16.820 
you pull the starter out of it and then

00:01:16.820 --> 00:01:22.749 
you pull the starter out of it and then
you<00:01:17.210> can<00:01:17.420> go<00:01:18.520> we<00:01:19.520> have<00:01:20.499> the<00:01:21.499> front<00:01:21.890> drive<00:01:22.219> which

00:01:22.749 --> 00:01:22.759 
you can go we have the front drive which

00:01:22.759 --> 00:01:24.910 
you can go we have the front drive which
is<00:01:22.789> there<00:01:23.179> the<00:01:24.079> drive<00:01:24.319> shaft<00:01:24.619> in<00:01:24.799> the<00:01:24.829> middle

00:01:24.910 --> 00:01:24.920 
is there the drive shaft in the middle

00:01:24.920 --> 00:01:28.090 
is there the drive shaft in the middle
and<00:01:25.340> then<00:01:25.850> the<00:01:26.030> rear<00:01:26.240> drive<00:01:26.600> which<00:01:27.380> is<00:01:27.710> the

00:01:28.090 --> 00:01:28.100 
and then the rear drive which is the

00:01:28.100 --> 00:01:30.789 
and then the rear drive which is the
most<00:01:28.310> complicated<00:01:28.759> part<00:01:29.359> of<00:01:30.200> building<00:01:30.499> the

00:01:30.789 --> 00:01:30.799 
most complicated part of building the

00:01:30.799 --> 00:01:33.129 
most complicated part of building the
cars<00:01:31.100> very<00:01:31.340> hard<00:01:31.609> and<00:01:31.939> it's<00:01:32.210> very<00:01:32.270> fiddly<00:01:32.749> so

00:01:33.129 --> 00:01:33.139 
cars very hard and it's very fiddly so

00:01:33.139 --> 00:01:35.980 
cars very hard and it's very fiddly so
if<00:01:33.710> you<00:01:33.920> are<00:01:34.100> going<00:01:34.340> to<00:01:34.639> decide<00:01:35.630> that<00:01:35.810> you<00:01:35.960> are

00:01:35.980 --> 00:01:35.990 
if you are going to decide that you are

00:01:35.990 --> 00:01:39.219 
if you are going to decide that you are
going<00:01:36.200> to<00:01:36.289> build<00:01:36.469> one<00:01:36.829> I<00:01:37.069> just<00:01:37.490> definitely<00:01:38.229> get

00:01:39.219 --> 00:01:39.229 
going to build one I just definitely get

00:01:39.229 --> 00:01:41.440 
going to build one I just definitely get
a<00:01:39.259> bit<00:01:39.439> of<00:01:39.530> help<00:01:39.710> on<00:01:39.859> max<00:01:40.130> I'm<00:01:40.850> glad<00:01:41.060> to<00:01:41.210> get<00:01:41.329> my

00:01:49.810 --> 00:01:49.820 
then there's the exhaust the engine and

00:01:49.820 --> 00:01:55.280 
then there's the exhaust the engine and
then<00:01:50.990> in<00:01:51.990> the<00:01:52.140> side<00:01:52.729> there<00:01:53.729> is<00:01:53.930> this<00:01:54.930> little

00:01:55.280 --> 00:01:55.290 
then in the side there is this little

00:01:55.290 --> 00:01:58.520 
then in the side there is this little
container<00:01:55.830> and<00:01:56.220> what<00:01:57.210> goes<00:01:57.420> in<00:01:57.600> there<00:01:57.810> is<00:01:58.320> the

00:01:58.520 --> 00:01:58.530 
container and what goes in there is the

00:01:58.530 --> 00:02:01.520 
container and what goes in there is the
battery<00:01:59.130> and<00:01:59.539> the<00:02:00.539> receiver<00:02:00.960> for<00:02:01.439> the

00:02:01.520 --> 00:02:01.530 
battery and the receiver for the

00:02:01.530 --> 00:02:03.590 
battery and the receiver for the
controller<00:02:01.979> that<00:02:02.850> goes<00:02:03.090> in<00:02:03.240> there<00:02:03.360> and<00:02:03.420> then

00:02:03.590 --> 00:02:03.600 
controller that goes in there and then

00:02:03.600 --> 00:02:06.410 
controller that goes in there and then
of<00:02:03.750> course<00:02:03.990> you've<00:02:04.140> got<00:02:04.170> the<00:02:04.320> big<00:02:04.970> wire<00:02:05.970> what

00:02:06.410 --> 00:02:06.420 
of course you've got the big wire what

00:02:06.420 --> 00:02:12.290 
of course you've got the big wire what
you<00:02:06.539> are<00:02:06.689> normal<00:02:07.350> again<00:02:09.380> then<00:02:10.610> I'm<00:02:11.610> in<00:02:12.180> the
