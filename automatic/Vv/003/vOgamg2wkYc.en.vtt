00:00:24.820 --> 00:00:35.340
Fligh high, up to the distant sky, looking down on pure white clouds

00:00:35.340 --> 00:00:45.220
Let loose your free spirit, riding on the wind

00:00:53.460 --> 00:00:57.940
And so, they’re coming here too

00:00:58.600 --> 00:01:03.660
Setting their sights on this planet

00:01:03.660 --> 00:01:08.820
A savage premonition, Fight! Fight! Fight!

00:01:08.820 --> 00:01:13.300
I’ll become the Earth’s protector

00:01:13.300 --> 00:01:18.640
That’s right, I won’t stop fighting till the end

00:01:18.640 --> 00:01:23.860
So that the blue Earth won’t stop turning

00:01:23.860 --> 00:01:34.680
Stand against them, My fists full of conviction won’t lose to anyone

00:01:34.680 --> 00:01:47.280
Show them, My courage will be what saves the future, For The World!
