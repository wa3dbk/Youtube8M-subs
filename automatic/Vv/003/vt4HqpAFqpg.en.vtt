00:00:04.920 --> 00:00:11.940
 Hello, nothing that I have been thrown out of 

00:00:08.160 --> 00:00:13.380
 cook in a jam as good I guess 

00:00:11.940 --> 00:00:14.639
 that you also goes to your house I 

00:00:13.380 --> 00:00:17.160
 they have thrown out and I have to do here the 

00:00:14.639 --> 00:00:19.320
 kitchen segment in a corner of 

00:00:17.160 --> 00:00:21.110
 lounge is not a very appropriate place but 

00:00:19.320 --> 00:00:23.789
 finally what we are going to see is going to be 

00:00:21.110 --> 00:00:25.770
 really delicious because we're going to do some 

00:00:23.789 --> 00:00:27.930
 French fries baked and very 

00:00:25.770 --> 00:00:30.689
 specials and you will ask 

00:00:27.930 --> 00:00:33.120
 fried baked in that we were then yes 

00:00:30.689 --> 00:00:35.760
 because they are like chips but 

00:00:33.120 --> 00:00:38.220
 instead of frying them in a lot of oil they 

00:00:35.760 --> 00:00:39.870
 prepare and put in the oven with which 

00:00:38.220 --> 00:00:42.300
 we saved a lot of calories from 

00:00:39.870 --> 00:00:45.000
 a lot of oil we go with the most 

00:00:42.300 --> 00:00:46.490
 important that are the ingredients there 

00:00:45.000 --> 00:00:51.470
 we go 

00:00:46.490 --> 00:00:53.930
 here we have potatoes like two large or 

00:00:51.470 --> 00:00:55.850
 three medians cut, you can see 

00:00:53.930 --> 00:00:58.880
 that shape with the skin of course 

00:00:55.850 --> 00:01:01.460
 we will know before washed carefully 

00:00:58.880 --> 00:01:05.540
 you see the sizes more or less that are 

00:01:01.460 --> 00:01:08.420
 cut more or less well then two 

00:01:05.540 --> 00:01:09.830
 large or three medium potatoes cut 

00:01:08.420 --> 00:01:14.080
 A) Yes 

00:01:09.830 --> 00:01:14.080
 two tablespoons of oil 

00:01:14.350 --> 00:01:20.340
 a teaspoon of paprika 

00:01:17.760 --> 00:01:24.150
 we're going half better because it's very 

00:01:20.340 --> 00:01:27.540
 spicy half a teaspoon of cayenne a 

00:01:24.150 --> 00:01:31.290
 teaspoon of half a teaspoon salt 

00:01:27.540 --> 00:01:34.950
 black pepper a teaspoon of powder 

00:01:31.290 --> 00:01:38.910
 of garlic a teaspoon and a half of 

00:01:34.950 --> 00:01:41.260
 oregano and a teaspoon of powder 

00:01:38.910 --> 00:01:43.300
 onion 

00:01:41.260 --> 00:01:44.860
 Now what we are going to do is mix 

00:01:43.300 --> 00:01:47.280
 all the ingredients and the potatoes 

00:01:44.860 --> 00:01:50.820
 so that they are well covered or that 

00:01:47.280 --> 00:01:50.820
 go for it 

00:01:52.060 --> 00:01:54.659
 the oil 

00:01:55.790 --> 00:01:58.390
 chin 

00:02:10.250 --> 00:02:15.100
 ah 

00:02:11.390 --> 00:02:15.100
 and return it well 

00:02:16.020 --> 00:02:19.490
 with two tablespoons 

00:02:19.940 --> 00:02:26.990
 As you can see, the kicks have caught 

00:02:24.440 --> 00:02:29.890
 everything is the same color and the 

00:02:26.990 --> 00:02:33.310
 time to place them in the tray 

00:02:29.890 --> 00:02:36.670
 and there we go for the tray 

00:02:33.310 --> 00:02:39.310
 here is the tray filled place them 

00:02:36.670 --> 00:02:42.330
 by the fast track as we do the housewives 

00:02:39.310 --> 00:02:45.110
 of house all here 

00:02:42.330 --> 00:02:47.280
 And now I do throw in the dressing a little 

00:02:45.110 --> 00:02:50.450
 that this I think is convenient 

00:02:47.280 --> 00:02:53.390
 throw away what little is left over 

00:02:50.450 --> 00:02:56.010
 set aside this and distribute the 

00:02:53.390 --> 00:02:57.690
 distribute the most of anything so that it does not 

00:02:56.010 --> 00:03:01.260
 hit with each other that this either 

00:02:57.690 --> 00:03:03.810
 would agree with a thousand also say that 

00:03:01.260 --> 00:03:05.400
 we have preheated the oven to about 200 

00:03:03.810 --> 00:03:09.000
 degrees 

00:03:05.400 --> 00:03:11.700
 and that we're going to have the potatoes 

00:03:09.000 --> 00:03:14.790
 there in the oven for about 

00:03:11.700 --> 00:03:16.590
 20 minutes 20 minutes whenever 

00:03:14.790 --> 00:03:18.060
 we talk about minutes in ovens you know 

00:03:16.590 --> 00:03:20.280
 I do not want to repeat myself become heavy 

00:03:18.060 --> 00:03:22.860
 just remind you that the ovens 

00:03:20.280 --> 00:03:24.600
 they are very special and each one each 

00:03:22.860 --> 00:03:26.700
 I mean those 20 minutes at 20 

00:03:24.600 --> 00:03:29.010
 minutes what is a fork and the 

00:03:26.700 --> 00:03:30.390
 pinchais will be golden brown on the outside 

00:03:29.010 --> 00:03:32.190
 The important thing is that not only 

00:03:30.390 --> 00:03:34.080
 golden brown on the outside but to step on them 

00:03:32.190 --> 00:03:36.000
 with the fork inside they are soft 

00:03:34.080 --> 00:03:38.070
 that are blanditas and tostaditas already 

00:03:36.000 --> 00:03:40.170
 they are fine that the interior is still 

00:03:38.070 --> 00:03:42.270
 is not it a bit hard the 

00:03:40.170 --> 00:03:44.370
 you leave about 10 minutes more until 

00:03:42.270 --> 00:03:46.320
 that when you click on them they are crispy and 

00:03:44.370 --> 00:03:48.690
 more golden and very squishy 

00:03:46.320 --> 00:03:50.550
 inside of agreement then nothing for the 

00:03:48.690 --> 00:03:53.550
 oven that I'm going guys open me the 

00:03:50.550 --> 00:03:56.959
 door that I go and here are our 

00:03:53.550 --> 00:04:01.020
 exquisite and special chips 

00:03:56.959 --> 00:04:04.770
 baked delicious the first dish of 

00:04:01.020 --> 00:04:07.290

00:04:04.770 --> 00:04:08.970
 the room and cooked that yes in the oven 

00:04:07.290 --> 00:04:12.600
 what has worked 

00:04:08.970 --> 00:04:14.280
 bad that you enjoy them and do many 

00:04:12.600 --> 00:04:16.079
 because they will disappear at a speed 

00:04:14.280 --> 00:04:20.209
