 no but cold to kkl so stop the 

00:02:12.910 --> 00:02:16.390
 northern pike is a creature from 

00:02:14.769 --> 00:02:18.400
 rampeÃ¹ for some like what apple the 

00:02:16.390 --> 00:02:20.739
 nothingness and one who is actually she 

00:02:18.400 --> 00:02:24.130

00:02:20.739 --> 00:02:26.200
 who are also like that and we do not publish 

00:02:24.130 --> 00:02:29.380
 to move occupation simply make 

00:02:26.200 --> 00:02:30.910
 kill moors is mowed one according to the 

00:02:29.380 --> 00:02:32.410
 asks for the grand thing while mom has 

00:02:30.910 --> 00:02:36.069
 for occupation alone and then in the 

00:02:32.410 --> 00:02:37.959
 life than cooking go 

00:02:36.069 --> 00:02:40.120
 whore and starts running and truth the 

00:02:37.959 --> 00:02:41.859
 time so the ball not his point of view 

00:02:40.120 --> 00:02:43.930
 graphic is quite varied we have them 

00:02:41.859 --> 00:02:45.819
 strips that are in the majority on the death 

00:02:43.930 --> 00:02:48.130
 who are cimino to some lambres 

00:02:45.819 --> 00:02:50.440
 will find it white julien and so 

00:02:48.130 --> 00:02:53.950
 that they are sprinkled with no less than ad or 

00:02:50.440 --> 00:02:56.410
 little bonuses here and there that are 

00:02:53.950 --> 00:02:58.420
 them marginally in color then also 

00:02:56.410 --> 00:03:00.489
 to note that we have the right and crypt of 

00:02:58.420 --> 00:03:01.690
 buzz aldrin win7 characters from our 

00:03:00.489 --> 00:03:04.120
 made 

00:03:01.690 --> 00:03:05.620
 yes by the way been on his blog and 

00:03:04.120 --> 00:03:09.100
 so that comes in addition some 

00:03:05.620 --> 00:03:11.410
 so but that's actually so yeah and no yes 

00:03:09.100 --> 00:03:13.270
 because actually so downright because 

00:03:11.410 --> 00:03:15.430
 that actually to make it simple and 

00:03:13.270 --> 00:03:17.650
 understand the stuff he screwed up 

00:03:15.430 --> 00:03:19.630
 in his in his comic a system of 

00:03:17.650 --> 00:03:22.750
 augmented reality of calais with your 

00:03:19.630 --> 00:03:24.070
 iphone or android same date abete and 

00:03:22.750 --> 00:03:25.180
 so with that you will be able to the pupils 

00:03:24.070 --> 00:03:27.250
 evolve and in the north of the city 

00:03:25.180 --> 00:03:29.110
 explains why he put his comics but 

00:03:27.250 --> 00:03:31.030
 it's still very interesting and it's a 

00:03:29.110 --> 00:03:33.880
 little more that is very nice so 

00:03:31.030 --> 00:03:35.560
 point of view of the bar narrative despite the 

00:03:33.880 --> 00:03:37.380
 strong maastricht we have a temporality and 

00:03:35.560 --> 00:03:41.020
 a strahm scenario quite advanced 

00:03:37.380 --> 00:03:42.310
 and so we spend enough moments 

00:03:41.020 --> 00:03:43.660
 fun like palop the return of 

00:03:42.310 --> 00:03:45.160
 digital classes 

00:03:43.660 --> 00:03:48.370
 precisely we would have presented to all 

00:03:45.160 --> 00:03:50.080
 class and in the dico so we go from 

00:03:48.370 --> 00:03:52.060
 that moment what is funny enough 

00:03:50.080 --> 00:03:54.850
 even if it's a stylist completely 

00:03:52.060 --> 00:03:56.680
 assumed to demonstrate sad and very 

00:03:54.850 --> 00:03:58.690
 touching as by taking 

00:03:56.680 --> 00:04:01.240
 aware of the ped what he did to this 

00:03:58.690 --> 00:04:03.430
 who makes his remorse that he feels or 

00:04:01.240 --> 00:04:06.100
 even there I think especially about the scene of 

00:04:03.430 --> 00:04:08.410
 the beaten child and it's sad when 

00:04:06.100 --> 00:04:10.540
 same but the wall all this is latin hard 

00:04:08.410 --> 00:04:12.130
 here because I know how to poke a trick at 

00:04:10.540 --> 00:04:14.440
 people better known than me for precisely 

00:04:12.130 --> 00:04:16.290
 avoid spoiling yourself those who have 

00:04:14.440 --> 00:04:18.910
 want to be glued long and therefore 

00:04:16.290 --> 00:04:20.830
 so be careful little jingle and 

00:04:18.910 --> 00:04:22.870
 the camphor indication takes the video 

00:04:20.830 --> 00:04:24.480
 with a little tigers so everything will go 

00:04:22.870 --> 00:04:27.010
 very well apicil what does not come back 

00:04:24.480 --> 00:04:28.540
 be careful you approach the dome spoiler 

00:04:27.010 --> 00:04:30.460
 if you do not want the end of the boulevard 

00:04:28.540 --> 00:04:32.650
 which we recommend not to look at this 

00:04:30.460 --> 00:04:34.600
 who will follow went to the indicated tiger 

00:04:32.650 --> 00:04:36.340
 below if you do not reveal anything to 

00:04:34.600 --> 00:04:37.370
 to rollerblade or that if you have seen 

00:04:36.340 --> 00:04:39.790
 the end 

00:04:37.370 --> 00:04:43.760
 my opinion a topic interests you remained 

00:04:39.790 --> 00:04:44.750
 at the beginning the death indicates asselah to 

00:04:43.760 --> 00:04:45.169
 other students who have in any case a 

00:04:44.750 --> 00:04:46.970
 leukemia 

00:04:45.169 --> 00:04:49.820
 we will very quickly discover which one 

00:04:46.970 --> 00:04:52.250
 it's about and downstairs we're going this kid to 

00:04:49.820 --> 00:04:53.570
 place to stop him at the dead attic goes 

00:04:52.250 --> 00:04:55.520
 wanting to come to a friend we are not 

00:04:53.570 --> 00:04:57.530
 not for interest but simply because 

00:04:55.520 --> 00:04:59.150
 that he too rejected and so and because 

00:04:57.530 --> 00:05:01.220
 that he is unhappy it is passage and 

00:04:59.150 --> 00:05:03.590
 so at the moment he's a bond of friendship we get 

00:05:01.220 --> 00:05:05.479
 train between them and the little brand 

00:05:03.590 --> 00:05:07.160
 guilt not ask the big ones 

00:05:05.479 --> 00:05:11.120
 all so he who orders him to kill 

00:05:07.160 --> 00:05:12.470
 his friend of the spared but the big 

00:05:11.120 --> 00:05:14.300
 for him not go he'll do my guys not 

00:05:12.470 --> 00:05:15.470
 to say no problem with will tell him I 

00:05:14.300 --> 00:05:17.360
 agree if you 

00:05:15.470 --> 00:05:21.080
 sacrifies a master locates t shirt in 

00:05:17.360 --> 00:05:24.650
 France on that and so finally death 

00:05:21.080 --> 00:05:27.199
 after long hesitations will accept 

00:05:24.650 --> 00:05:28.789
 his x1 and killed do that because without 

00:05:27.199 --> 00:05:30.470
 messing up we feel this internal conflict at 

00:05:28.789 --> 00:05:32.750
 character who turns the world here 

00:05:30.470 --> 00:05:34.190
 design moment the only one he accepts 

00:05:32.750 --> 00:05:34.580
 when do they have its next 

00:05:34.190 --> 00:05:36.050
 victims 

00:05:34.580 --> 00:05:37.789
 hence the efforts of the little death 

00:05:36.050 --> 00:05:39.320
 could not be his bed these decisions 

00:05:37.789 --> 00:05:41.419
 spared sands the only relationship 

00:05:39.320 --> 00:05:42.590
 friendly that he has with humans have said 

00:05:41.419 --> 00:05:44.210
 no to a part of his family in 

00:05:42.590 --> 00:05:46.700
 the political council occurrence monday 

00:05:44.210 --> 00:05:48.289
 the humanity that is lifted - which 

00:05:46.700 --> 00:05:50.479
 gives us a very strong empathy with 

00:05:48.289 --> 00:05:50.840
 the character and me it makes me want 

00:05:50.479 --> 00:05:53.450
 to cry 

00:05:50.840 --> 00:05:55.190
 this is the end of the spoiler we want 

00:05:53.450 --> 00:05:56.630
 all of us thanks for not being 

00:05:55.190 --> 00:05:58.580
 went in the comments otherwise I do not 

00:05:56.630 --> 00:06:01.070
 would not be happy and I'm upset 

00:05:58.580 --> 00:06:03.560
 so here's the little death it's a very 

00:06:01.070 --> 00:06:05.510
 very very good book of davy mourier 

00:06:03.560 --> 00:06:07.639
 but to perfection 

00:06:05.510 --> 00:06:09.500
 I recommend it very warmly 

00:06:07.639 --> 00:06:11.120
 a big favorite for me is 

00:06:09.500 --> 00:06:12.289
 an action taken and then came to read there 

00:06:11.120 --> 00:06:14.570
