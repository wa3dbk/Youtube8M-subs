foot 160 horsepower and 170 foot-pounds
of<00:00:56.840> torque<00:00:56.900> we<00:00:57.680> adjusted<00:00:58.070> the<00:00:58.130> suspension<00:00:58.790> the

00:00:59.320 --> 00:00:59.330 
of torque we adjusted the suspension the

00:00:59.330 --> 00:01:01.300 
of torque we adjusted the suspension the
brakes<00:00:59.360> we<00:01:00.290> added<00:01:00.560> an<00:01:00.650> electronic<00:01:01.160> stability

00:01:01.300 --> 00:01:01.310 
brakes we added an electronic stability

00:01:01.310 --> 00:01:03.220 
brakes we added an electronic stability
control<00:01:01.610> system<00:01:02.270> actually<00:01:02.450> has<00:01:02.630> three<00:01:02.900> modes

00:01:03.220 --> 00:01:03.230 
control system actually has three modes

00:01:03.230 --> 00:01:06.370 
control system actually has three modes
so<00:01:04.040> depending<00:01:04.369> on<00:01:04.369> your<00:01:04.549> driving<00:01:04.820> ability<00:01:05.380> you

so depending on your driving ability you

00:01:06.380 --> 00:01:08.950 
so depending on your driving ability you
can<00:01:06.500> actually<00:01:06.710> either<00:01:07.400> keep<00:01:07.730> it<00:01:07.850> on<00:01:08.060> partially

00:01:08.950 --> 00:01:08.960 
can actually either keep it on partially

00:01:08.960 --> 00:01:11.140 
can actually either keep it on partially
on<00:01:09.140> or<00:01:09.320> completely<00:01:09.770> off<00:01:10.040> to<00:01:10.610> see<00:01:10.760> if<00:01:10.850> you<00:01:10.940> can

00:01:11.140 --> 00:01:11.150 
on or completely off to see if you can

00:01:11.150 --> 00:01:13.060 
on or completely off to see if you can
handle<00:01:11.930> all<00:01:12.230> the<00:01:12.320> power<00:01:12.530> that<00:01:12.590> we<00:01:12.770> put<00:01:12.920> onto

00:01:13.060 --> 00:01:13.070 
handle all the power that we put onto

00:03:16.440 --> 00:03:19.280 
they're priced a little bit more
expensive<00:03:17.130> than<00:03:17.250> and<00:03:17.519> then<00:03:17.730> you<00:03:17.850> also<00:03:18.000> get<00:03:18.290> the

00:03:19.280 --> 00:03:19.290 
expensive than and then you also get the

00:03:19.290 --> 00:03:20.720 
expensive than and then you also get the
driving<00:03:19.680> experience<00:03:19.769> with<00:03:20.190> our<00:03:20.280> so<00:03:20.489> we<00:03:20.580> think

00:03:20.720 --> 00:03:20.730 
driving experience with our so we think

00:03:20.730 --> 00:03:22.850 
driving experience with our so we think
that<00:03:20.850> based<00:03:21.150> on<00:03:21.299> the<00:03:21.450> price<00:03:21.660> the<00:03:22.170> Abarth<00:03:22.620> name

00:03:22.850 --> 00:03:22.860 
that based on the price the Abarth name

00:03:22.860 --> 00:03:26.000 
that based on the price the Abarth name
in<00:03:23.100> the<00:03:23.250> world<00:03:23.459> is<00:03:23.989> one<00:03:24.989> with<00:03:25.200> racing<00:03:25.680> Carla

00:03:26.000 --> 00:03:26.010 
in the world is one with racing Carla

00:03:26.010 --> 00:03:28.370 
in the world is one with racing Carla
Bart<00:03:26.220> and<00:03:26.640> one<00:03:26.850> I<00:03:27.060> think<00:03:27.360> 800<00:03:27.750> races<00:03:28.049> in<00:03:28.200> one

00:03:28.370 --> 00:03:28.380 
Bart and one I think 800 races in one

00:03:28.380 --> 00:03:30.470 
Bart and one I think 800 races in one
year<00:03:28.650> alone<00:03:28.790> he's<00:03:29.790> really<00:03:30.030> big<00:03:30.269> in<00:03:30.390> the

00:03:30.470 --> 00:03:30.480 
year alone he's really big in the

00:03:30.480 --> 00:03:31.970 
year alone he's really big in the
aftermarket<00:03:30.930> and<00:03:31.350> up<00:03:31.470> fitting<00:03:31.680> the

00:03:31.970 --> 00:03:31.980 
aftermarket and up fitting the

00:03:31.980 --> 00:03:34.819 
aftermarket and up fitting the
customization<00:03:32.730> that<00:03:32.760> you<00:03:33.000> see<00:03:33.269> in<00:03:34.110> this<00:03:34.500> car
