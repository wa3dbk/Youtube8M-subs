00:00:54.709 --> 00:00:54.719 
medium range that's pretty much why put

00:00:54.719 --> 00:00:56.209

it<00:00:54.780> on<00:00:54.899> I<00:00:55.079> put<00:00:55.110> a<00:00:55.260> silencer<00:00:55.469> on<00:00:55.739> because<00:00:56.070> I

00:00:56.209 --> 00:00:56.219 
it on I put a silencer on because I

00:00:56.219 --> 00:00:57.350 
it on I put a silencer on because I
don't<00:00:56.340> want<00:00:56.460> to<00:00:56.520> be<00:00:56.579> seen<00:00:56.850> on<00:00:57.000> the<00:00:57.030> mini-map

00:00:59.630 --> 00:00:59.640 
and the silence doesn't really give you

00:00:59.640 --> 00:01:01.189 
and the silence doesn't really give you
any<00:00:59.820> more<00:00:59.940> recoil<00:01:00.359> and<00:01:00.629> I've<00:01:00.750> got<00:01:00.899> to<00:01:00.989> say<00:01:01.079> the

00:01:01.189 --> 00:01:01.199 
any more recoil and I've got to say the

00:01:01.199 --> 00:01:02.660 
any more recoil and I've got to say the
damage<00:01:01.530> is<00:01:01.649> pretty<00:01:01.829> much<00:01:02.039> about<00:01:02.280> the<00:01:02.430> same

00:01:02.660 --> 00:01:02.670 
damage is pretty much about the same

00:01:02.670 --> 00:01:06.230 
damage is pretty much about the same
with<00:01:02.879> silencer<00:01:03.359> on<00:01:03.510> or<00:01:03.840> silencer<00:01:04.379> off<00:01:05.240> now

00:01:35.600 --> 00:01:35.610 
what I also have scavenger this is also

00:01:35.610 --> 00:01:37.910

useful<00:01:35.909> just<00:01:36.390> walk<00:01:36.930> over<00:01:37.049> an<00:01:37.229> enemy<00:01:37.560> and<00:01:37.799> get

00:01:37.910 --> 00:01:37.920 
useful just walk over an enemy and get

00:01:37.920 --> 00:01:39.859 
useful just walk over an enemy and get
some<00:01:38.130> more<00:01:38.280> ammo<00:01:38.610> for<00:01:38.729> free<00:01:39.030> this<00:01:39.630> gun

00:01:42.140 --> 00:01:42.150 
actually does waste out a lot of ammo

00:01:42.150 --> 00:01:43.880 
actually does waste out a lot of ammo
because<00:01:42.570> it<00:01:42.689> doesn't<00:01:42.960> have<00:01:43.049> much<00:01:43.259> clips<00:01:43.649> and
