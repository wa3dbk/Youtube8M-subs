00:01:59.100 --> 00:02:02.920 
it from time to time so how about the
options<00:01:59.219> to<00:01:59.549> make<00:01:59.700> this<00:01:59.850> case<00:02:00.090> interest<00:02:00.689> and

00:02:02.920 --> 00:02:02.930 

00:02:02.930 --> 00:02:06.020 

if<00:02:03.930> you<00:02:04.079> open<00:02:04.320> up<00:02:04.380> this<00:02:04.530> club<00:02:04.770> pin<00:02:05.070> you<00:02:05.939> have

00:02:06.020 --> 00:02:06.030 
if you open up this club pin you have

00:02:06.030 --> 00:02:07.880 
if you open up this club pin you have
the<00:02:06.180> options<00:02:06.509> a<00:02:06.570> few<00:02:06.750> decades<00:02:07.020> at<00:02:07.469> twenty

00:02:07.880 --> 00:02:07.890 
the options a few decades at twenty

00:02:07.890 --> 00:02:09.010 
the options a few decades at twenty
different<00:02:08.009> angles

00:02:09.010 --> 00:02:09.020 
different angles

00:02:09.020 --> 00:02:11.590 
different angles
if<00:02:09.740> you<00:02:09.890> see<00:02:10.100> enough<00:02:10.310> maybe<00:02:10.550> I'd<00:02:10.760> like<00:02:10.940> this<00:02:11.150> or

00:02:11.590 --> 00:02:11.600 
if you see enough maybe I'd like this or

00:02:11.600 --> 00:02:14.740 
if you see enough maybe I'd like this or
laying<00:02:12.170> down<00:02:12.470> maybe<00:02:12.980> further<00:02:13.340> back<00:02:13.750> I'm

00:02:14.740 --> 00:02:14.750 
laying down maybe further back I'm

00:02:14.750 --> 00:02:16.060 
laying down maybe further back I'm
sitting<00:02:14.990> upright<00:02:15.230> and<00:02:15.530> I'm<00:02:15.620> going<00:02:15.740> to<00:02:15.800> have<00:02:15.920> it

00:02:16.060 --> 00:02:16.070 
sitting upright and I'm going to have it

00:02:16.070 --> 00:02:22.260 
sitting upright and I'm going to have it
somewhere<00:02:16.370> in<00:02:16.580> the<00:02:16.670> middle<00:02:19.780> as<00:02:20.800> you<00:02:21.800> can<00:02:21.920> see

00:02:22.260 --> 00:02:22.270 
somewhere in the middle as you can see

00:02:22.270 --> 00:02:25.540 
somewhere in the middle as you can see
it's<00:02:23.270> very<00:02:23.480> sturdy<00:02:23.720> and<00:02:24.400> it's<00:02:25.400> very

00:02:25.540 --> 00:02:25.550 
it's very sturdy and it's very

00:02:25.550 --> 00:02:29.400 
it's very sturdy and it's very
comfortable<00:02:25.910> two<00:02:26.090> views<00:02:26.330> from<00:02:26.540> any<00:02:26.750> angle

00:02:29.400 --> 00:02:29.410 

00:02:29.410 --> 00:02:31.840 

it's<00:02:30.410> a<00:02:30.500> lot<00:02:30.650> better<00:02:30.800> than<00:02:31.310> having<00:02:31.520> to<00:02:31.700> hold

00:02:31.840 --> 00:02:31.850 
it's a lot better than having to hold

00:02:31.850 --> 00:02:34.660 
it's a lot better than having to hold
the<00:02:32.030> case<00:02:32.320> with<00:02:33.320> two<00:02:33.500> hands<00:02:33.950> or<00:02:34.220> even<00:02:34.550> today

00:02:34.660 --> 00:02:34.670 
the case with two hands or even today

00:02:34.670 --> 00:02:41.320 
the case with two hands or even today
it's<00:02:34.910> less<00:02:35.060> just<00:02:35.900> to<00:02:36.020> view<00:02:36.230> it<00:02:39.250> okay<00:02:40.250> the<00:02:40.970> final

00:02:41.320 --> 00:02:41.330 
it's less just to view it okay the final

00:02:41.330 --> 00:02:43.000 
it's less just to view it okay the final
part<00:02:41.450> about<00:02:41.660> this<00:02:41.840> case<00:02:42.110> and<00:02:42.500> possibly<00:02:42.890> the

00:02:43.000 --> 00:02:43.010 
part about this case and possibly the

00:02:43.010 --> 00:02:45.280 
part about this case and possibly the
most<00:02:43.130> useful<00:02:43.430> is<00:02:44.360> the<00:02:44.600> option<00:02:44.690> to<00:02:44.870> angle<00:02:45.230> your

00:02:45.280 --> 00:02:45.290 
most useful is the option to angle your

00:02:45.290 --> 00:02:46.780 
most useful is the option to angle your
iPad<00:02:45.620> in<00:02:45.800> a<00:02:45.860> way<00:02:45.980> to<00:02:46.040> make<00:02:46.280> the<00:02:46.400> keyboard

00:02:46.780 --> 00:02:46.790 
iPad in a way to make the keyboard

00:02:46.790 --> 00:02:50.560 
iPad in a way to make the keyboard
infinitely<00:02:47.240> easier<00:02:47.330> to<00:02:47.780> type<00:02:47.960> on<00:02:49.180> if<00:02:50.180> you<00:02:50.420> have

00:02:50.560 --> 00:02:50.570

00:02:52.660 --> 00:02:52.670 
an iPad and you have tried to fight you

00:02:52.670 --> 00:02:54.130
