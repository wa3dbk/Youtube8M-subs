what is one of his go-to guys when you
go<00:01:54.329> up<00:01:54.450> to<00:01:54.509> the<00:01:54.689> National<00:01:54.990> Hockey<00:01:55.140> League<00:01:55.290> in

00:01:55.460 --> 00:01:55.470 
go up to the National Hockey League in

00:01:55.470 --> 00:01:57.560 
go up to the National Hockey League in
you<00:01:55.530> play<00:01:55.710> for<00:01:56.280> a<00:01:56.310> Palmer<00:01:56.729> races<00:01:57.030> there<00:01:57.210> is

00:01:57.560 --> 00:01:57.570 
you play for a Palmer races there is

00:01:57.570 --> 00:01:59.179 
you play for a Palmer races there is
there<00:01:58.079> a<00:01:58.110> way<00:01:58.380> that<00:01:58.409> you<00:01:58.590> have<00:01:58.770> to<00:01:58.860> change<00:01:59.100> the

00:01:59.179 --> 00:01:59.189 
there a way that you have to change the

00:01:59.189 --> 00:02:01.130 
there a way that you have to change the
way<00:01:59.369> you<00:01:59.430> play<00:01:59.610> or<00:02:00.030> do<00:02:00.450> you<00:02:00.509> find<00:02:00.750> a<00:02:00.840> consistent

00:02:01.130 --> 00:02:01.140 
way you play or do you find a consistent

00:02:01.140 --> 00:02:02.240 
way you play or do you find a consistent
through<00:02:01.530> the<00:02:01.619> American<00:02:01.920> League<00:02:02.040> and<00:02:02.159> the

00:02:02.240 --> 00:02:02.250 
through the American League and the

00:02:02.250 --> 00:02:04.069 
through the American League and the
National<00:02:02.280> Hockey<00:02:02.700> League<00:02:02.820> I<00:02:03.149> think<00:02:03.750> it's<00:02:03.899> very

00:02:04.069 --> 00:02:04.079 
National Hockey League I think it's very

00:02:04.079 --> 00:02:07.550 
National Hockey League I think it's very
similar<00:02:04.590> obviously<00:02:05.280> the<00:02:05.780> systems<00:02:06.780> are<00:02:07.320> very

00:02:07.550 --> 00:02:07.560 
similar obviously the systems are very

00:02:07.560 --> 00:02:09.919 
similar obviously the systems are very
similar<00:02:07.920> or<00:02:08.369> you<00:02:08.610> go<00:02:08.729> up<00:02:08.759> there<00:02:09.090> and<00:02:09.270> it's<00:02:09.750> an

00:02:09.919 --> 00:02:09.929 
similar or you go up there and it's an

00:02:09.929 --> 00:02:11.040 
similar or you go up there and it's an
easy<00:02:10.110> transition<00:02:10.440> as

00:02:11.040 --> 00:02:11.050 
easy transition as

00:02:11.050 --> 00:02:13.740 
easy transition as
seems<00:02:11.200> like<00:02:11.440> a<00:02:12.030> little<00:02:13.030> things<00:02:13.270> like<00:02:13.450> power

00:02:13.740 --> 00:02:13.750 
seems like a little things like power

00:02:13.750 --> 00:02:16.680 
seems like a little things like power
play<00:02:13.990> breakout<00:02:14.500> and<00:02:14.860> the<00:02:15.850> four<00:02:16.090> checks<00:02:16.390> and

00:02:16.680 --> 00:02:16.690 
play breakout and the four checks and

00:02:16.690 --> 00:02:19.410 
play breakout and the four checks and
everything's<00:02:17.290> all<00:02:17.530> it's<00:02:17.680> all<00:02:17.800> similar<00:02:18.420> but

00:02:19.410 --> 00:02:19.420 
everything's all it's all similar but

00:02:19.420 --> 00:02:21.720 
everything's all it's all similar but
obviously<00:02:20.200> when<00:02:20.590> you<00:02:20.680> go<00:02:20.830> up<00:02:21.010> you<00:02:21.040> you<00:02:21.520> don't

00:02:21.720 --> 00:02:21.730 
obviously when you go up you you don't

00:02:21.730 --> 00:02:23.970 
obviously when you go up you you don't
have<00:02:21.910> as<00:02:22.060> much<00:02:22.440> you<00:02:23.440> don't<00:02:23.560> have<00:02:23.710> as<00:02:23.830> much

00:02:23.970 --> 00:02:23.980 
have as much you don't have as much

00:02:23.980 --> 00:02:26.220 
have as much you don't have as much
leniency<00:02:24.310> I<00:02:24.610> think<00:02:24.940> there's<00:02:25.690> there's<00:02:25.960> times

00:02:26.220 --> 00:02:26.230 
leniency I think there's there's times

00:02:26.230 --> 00:02:31.020 
leniency I think there's there's times
where<00:02:26.850> your<00:02:28.500> there's<00:02:29.500> times<00:02:29.710> where<00:02:30.030> you're

00:02:31.020 --> 00:02:31.030 
where your there's times where you're

00:02:31.030 --> 00:02:32.550 
where your there's times where you're
down<00:02:31.150> here<00:02:31.450> and<00:02:31.690> obviously<00:02:31.960> you're<00:02:32.320> playing

00:02:32.550 --> 00:02:32.560 
down here and obviously you're playing

00:02:32.560 --> 00:02:34.980 
down here and obviously you're playing
more<00:02:32.800> and<00:02:33.040> it's<00:02:33.340> great<00:02:33.640> and<00:02:33.820> you<00:02:34.210> can<00:02:34.840> make<00:02:34.960> a

00:02:34.980 --> 00:02:34.990 
more and it's great and you can make a

00:02:34.990 --> 00:02:37.530 
more and it's great and you can make a
few<00:02:35.230> mistakes<00:02:35.440> but<00:02:35.890> if<00:02:36.280> you're<00:02:36.430> up<00:02:36.490> there<00:02:36.550> it's

00:02:37.530 --> 00:02:37.540 
few mistakes but if you're up there it's

00:02:37.540 --> 00:02:39.840 
few mistakes but if you're up there it's
it's<00:02:38.170> a<00:02:38.380> little<00:02:38.620> more<00:02:38.710> strict<00:02:39.070> and<00:02:39.370> as<00:02:39.610> there's

00:02:39.840 --> 00:02:39.850 
it's a little more strict and as there's

00:02:39.850 --> 00:02:42.740 
it's a little more strict and as there's
a<00:02:39.910> little<00:02:40.030> more<00:02:40.210> pressure<00:02:40.450> so<00:02:41.230> I<00:02:41.260> think<00:02:41.590> I

00:02:42.740 --> 00:02:42.750 
a little more pressure so I think I

00:02:42.750 --> 00:02:45.120 
a little more pressure so I think I
guess<00:02:43.750> you<00:02:43.900> can't<00:02:44.080> really<00:02:44.170> worry<00:02:44.800> about<00:02:44.860> the

00:02:45.120 --> 00:02:45.130 
guess you can't really worry about the

00:02:45.130 --> 00:02:46.260 
guess you can't really worry about the
pressure<00:02:45.370> you<00:02:45.580> just<00:02:45.730> got<00:02:45.910> to<00:02:45.940> go<00:02:46.090> out<00:02:46.120> there

00:02:46.260 --> 00:02:46.270 
pressure you just got to go out there

00:02:46.270 --> 00:02:48.360 
pressure you just got to go out there
and<00:02:46.480> play<00:02:47.080> your<00:02:47.290> game<00:02:47.470> and<00:02:47.500> I<00:02:47.920> try<00:02:48.160> not<00:02:48.310> to

00:02:48.360 --> 00:02:48.370 
and play your game and I try not to

00:02:48.370 --> 00:02:50.760 
and play your game and I try not to
change<00:02:48.700> my<00:02:48.850> game<00:02:48.910> from<00:02:49.780> your<00:02:49.960> expectations<00:02:50.620> of

00:03:55.260 --> 00:03:55.270 
attitude had a good start to the season

00:03:55.270 --> 00:03:58.320 
attitude had a good start to the season
and<00:03:55.630> was<00:03:56.500> rewarded<00:03:56.709> with<00:03:57.100> a<00:03:57.250> call<00:03:57.550> up<00:03:57.730> later<00:03:58.150> in

00:03:58.320 --> 00:03:58.330 
and was rewarded with a call up later in

00:03:58.330 --> 00:04:00.449 
and was rewarded with a call up later in

00:04:03.780 --> 00:04:03.790 
progress is going very well and I think

00:04:03.790 --> 00:04:05.160 
progress is going very well and I think
it<00:04:04.180> should<00:04:04.330> be<00:04:04.480> just<00:04:04.510> a<00:04:04.810> matter<00:04:04.989> of<00:04:05.080> time

00:04:05.160 --> 00:04:05.170 
it should be just a matter of time

00:04:05.170 --> 00:04:08.040 
it should be just a matter of time
before<00:04:05.530> I<00:04:05.800> can<00:04:06.100> make<00:04:06.820> that<00:04:07.030> next<00:04:07.269> step<00:04:07.450> the

00:04:08.040 --> 00:04:08.050 
before I can make that next step the

00:04:08.050 --> 00:04:09.870 
before I can make that next step the
