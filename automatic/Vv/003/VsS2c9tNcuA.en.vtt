actually holds a couple world records if

00:00:36.120 --> 00:00:37.459 
actually holds a couple world records if
you<00:00:36.180> look<00:00:36.329> over<00:00:36.540> here<00:00:36.570> I<00:00:36.960> don't<00:00:37.170> know<00:00:37.320> if<00:00:37.380> this

00:00:37.459 --> 00:00:37.469 
you look over here I don't know if this

00:00:37.469 --> 00:00:39.260 
you look over here I don't know if this
is<00:00:37.910> current

00:00:39.260 --> 00:00:39.270 
is current

00:00:39.270 --> 00:00:45.529 
is current
but<00:00:40.100> 920<00:00:41.100> right<00:00:42.000> there<00:00:42.270> they<00:00:42.480> got<00:00:42.660> it<00:00:43.129> 240<00:00:44.539> 662

00:00:45.529 --> 00:00:45.539 
but 920 right there they got it 240 662

00:00:45.539 --> 00:00:48.830 
but 920 right there they got it 240 662
megahertz<00:00:46.020> and<00:00:46.140> they<00:00:46.230> got<00:00:46.379> a<00:00:46.530> 940<00:00:47.309> up<00:00:47.489> to<00:00:47.940> 4800

00:00:48.830 --> 00:00:48.840 
megahertz and they got a 940 up to 4800

00:00:48.840 --> 00:00:51.290 
megahertz and they got a 940 up to 4800
meters<00:00:48.870> that's<00:00:49.200> a<00:00:49.289> 64%<00:00:50.000> overclock<00:00:51.000> so<00:00:51.180> that's

00:00:51.290 --> 00:00:51.300 
meters that's a 64% overclock so that's

00:00:51.300 --> 00:00:52.279 
meters that's a 64% overclock so that's
pretty<00:00:51.480> impressive<00:00:51.660> I'm<00:00:51.930> not<00:00:52.050> sure<00:00:52.140> if<00:00:52.230> this

00:00:52.279 --> 00:00:52.289 
pretty impressive I'm not sure if this

00:00:52.289 --> 00:00:53.450 
pretty impressive I'm not sure if this
is<00:00:52.350> up<00:00:52.469> today<00:00:52.620> they<00:00:52.829> might<00:00:52.920> have<00:00:53.039> beaten<00:00:53.280> that

00:00:53.450 --> 00:00:53.460 
is up today they might have beaten that

00:00:53.460 --> 00:00:55.639 
is up today they might have beaten that
by<00:00:54.180> now<00:00:54.360> but<00:00:54.600> just<00:00:54.840> goes<00:00:54.989> to<00:00:55.079> show<00:00:55.230> you<00:00:55.289> that<00:00:55.379> at

00:00:55.639 --> 00:00:55.649 
by now but just goes to show you that at

00:00:55.649 --> 00:00:56.810 
by now but just goes to show you that at
one<00:00:55.800> point<00:00:55.829> time<00:00:56.160> they<00:00:56.309> were<00:00:56.370> in<00:00:56.579> contention

00:00:56.810 --> 00:00:56.820 
one point time they were in contention

00:00:56.820 --> 00:00:59.270 
one point time they were in contention
for<00:00:57.180> world<00:00:57.840> overclocking<00:00:58.559> records<00:00:58.890> and<00:00:59.100> this

00:00:59.270 --> 00:00:59.280 
for world overclocking records and this

00:00:59.280 --> 00:01:02.569 
for world overclocking records and this
board<00:00:59.520> does<00:00:59.820> overclock<00:01:00.660> like<00:01:01.199> crazy<00:01:01.469> so<00:01:02.399> it's

00:01:02.569 --> 00:01:02.579 
board does overclock like crazy so it's

00:01:02.579 --> 00:01:04.130 
board does overclock like crazy so it's
very<00:01:02.760> nice<00:01:02.969> the<00:01:03.030> test<00:01:03.420> one<00:01:03.570> that<00:01:03.600> I<00:01:03.719> had<00:01:03.899> that<00:01:04.110> I

00:01:04.130 --> 00:01:04.140 
very nice the test one that I had that I

00:01:04.140 --> 00:01:07.250 
very nice the test one that I had that I
destroyed<00:01:04.619> and<00:01:04.830> I<00:01:04.860> took<00:01:04.920> apart<00:01:05.810> did<00:01:06.810> very<00:01:07.020> well

00:01:07.250 --> 00:01:07.260 
destroyed and I took apart did very well

00:01:07.260 --> 00:01:09.320 
destroyed and I took apart did very well
it<00:01:07.500> actually<00:01:07.650> overclocked<00:01:08.130> very<00:01:08.369> high<00:01:08.549> the

00:01:09.320 --> 00:01:09.330 
it actually overclocked very high the

00:01:09.330 --> 00:01:12.080 
it actually overclocked very high the
capilla<00:01:09.659> the<00:01:10.500> host<00:01:11.040> frequency<00:01:11.430> went<00:01:11.729> through

00:01:12.080 --> 00:01:12.090 
capilla the host frequency went through

00:01:12.090 --> 00:01:13.880 
capilla the host frequency went through
the<00:01:12.180> roof<00:01:12.390> it<00:01:12.540> was<00:01:12.600> above<00:01:12.810> 200<00:01:13.260> so<00:01:13.770> it

00:01:13.880 --> 00:01:13.890 
the roof it was above 200 so it

00:01:13.890 --> 00:01:16.460 
the roof it was above 200 so it
performed<00:01:14.220> very<00:01:14.580> very<00:01:14.670> well<00:01:15.000> now<00:01:15.720> let<00:01:15.990> me<00:01:16.080> do

other stuff including a raid card in

00:06:30.360 --> 00:06:32.510 
other stuff including a raid card in
there<00:06:30.479> maybe<00:06:30.659> it<00:06:31.080> runs<00:06:31.259> it<00:06:31.440> x<00:06:31.620> 8<00:06:31.830> or<00:06:32.009> X<00:06:32.099> 4<00:06:32.340> it's

00:06:32.510 --> 00:06:32.520 
there maybe it runs it x 8 or X 4 it's

00:06:32.520 --> 00:06:34.370 
there maybe it runs it x 8 or X 4 it's
still<00:06:32.729> plenty<00:06:33.029> for<00:06:33.180> a<00:06:33.240> raid<00:06:33.389> card<00:06:33.569> so<00:06:34.259> it's

00:06:34.370 --> 00:06:34.380 
still plenty for a raid card so it's

00:06:34.380 --> 00:06:36.860 
still plenty for a raid card so it's
affordable<00:06:34.830> it<00:06:35.009> cool<00:06:35.339> as<00:06:35.430> well<00:06:35.610> it<00:06:36.240> does<00:06:36.449> SLI
