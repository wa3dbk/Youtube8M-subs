00:00:01.800 --> 00:00:06.269
 hello how are you in today's video 

00:00:04.140 --> 00:00:08.370
 to make a look in which the protagonist 

00:00:06.269 --> 00:00:10.920
 are the red lips accompanied by a 

00:00:08.370 --> 00:00:12.600
 Illuminated skin, I already anticipated a little 

00:00:10.920 --> 00:00:15.059
 work then apply for the 

00:00:12.600 --> 00:00:16.470
 translucent and mascara and that 

00:00:15.059 --> 00:00:18.810
 is going to be the look of the eyes something very 

00:00:16.470 --> 00:00:21.689
 natural and clear and we are going to 

00:00:18.810 --> 00:00:24.150
 now with the skin and for that the first 

00:00:21.689 --> 00:00:28.279
 product that I will use is this 

00:00:24.150 --> 00:00:28.279
 sera advanced genén de lancôme 

00:00:30.610 --> 00:00:34.390
 this floor is worn by one when several 

00:00:32.740 --> 00:00:36.970
 weeks and I liked it a lot because it 

00:00:34.390 --> 00:00:38.770
 absorbs very quickly then 

00:00:36.970 --> 00:00:41.260
 as a moisturizer I will occupy this 

00:00:38.770 --> 00:00:45.070
 of neutrogena that is the ràpita huincul 

00:00:41.260 --> 00:00:47.880
 repair and has factor 30 what does 

00:00:45.070 --> 00:00:47.880
 a very good alternative 

00:00:51.280 --> 00:00:54.789
 now let's start with the work of 

00:00:53.050 --> 00:00:56.769
 lighting and for that I'm going to apply 

00:00:54.789 --> 00:00:58.690
 the first lumen banic de l'oréal paris 

00:00:56.769 --> 00:01:00.579
 in the whole area of ​​the cheekbone 

00:00:58.690 --> 00:01:02.410
 I want to say two things about this first 

00:01:00.579 --> 00:01:05.259
 first you need very little 

00:01:02.410 --> 00:01:07.960
 amount and second to remember that it is 

00:01:05.259 --> 00:01:09.970
 a first that besides illuminating goes to 

00:01:07.960 --> 00:01:12.100
 Make your makeup last longer the base 

00:01:09.970 --> 00:01:14.200
 I'm going to use is the health and mac 

00:01:12.100 --> 00:01:17.080
 which is ideal for this look because it is 

00:01:14.200 --> 00:01:18.430
 a very light base and left an effect 

00:01:17.080 --> 00:01:20.259
 as if I had someone else a 

00:01:18.430 --> 00:01:22.930
 medication if it looks much more illuminated 

00:01:20.259 --> 00:01:24.580
 as a proofreader I will use this one of the 

00:01:22.930 --> 00:01:26.170
 mascara brand that today can 

00:01:24.580 --> 00:01:28.810
 find in chilena in the pharmacy 

00:01:26.170 --> 00:01:30.670
 normal and is the illuminator corrector the 

00:01:28.810 --> 00:01:33.070
 same time of line manches 

00:01:30.670 --> 00:01:35.140
 perfection I'm a little bit clearer 

00:01:33.070 --> 00:01:36.880
 but just wanted to show how 

00:01:35.140 --> 00:01:38.890
 they saw this corrector see them a little bit 

00:01:36.880 --> 00:01:40.270
 in the area of ​​the triangle of light to 

00:01:38.890 --> 00:01:42.880
 to illuminate 

00:01:40.270 --> 00:01:44.789
 and now I'm going to make a wiggle with the 

00:01:42.880 --> 00:01:47.859

00:01:44.789 --> 00:01:50.409
 previously by the tone c2 and now I'm going 

00:01:47.859 --> 00:01:52.360
 to occupy the c5 now yes the wiggle 

00:01:50.409 --> 00:01:53.770
 It can be made in cream or powder and in 

00:01:52.360 --> 00:01:56.219
 this case I will make it easy with 

00:01:53.770 --> 00:01:56.219
 tongues 

00:01:58.340 --> 00:02:02.810

00:02:00.409 --> 00:02:06.500
