but<00:00:49.780> in<00:00:50.050> this<00:00:50.140> particular<00:00:50.290> case<00:00:50.740> I<00:00:50.980> would<00:00:51.340> like

00:00:51.360 --> 00:00:51.370 
but in this particular case I would like

00:00:51.370 --> 00:00:53.490 
but in this particular case I would like
to<00:00:51.579> classify<00:00:51.730> him<00:00:52.120> as<00:00:52.150> semi<00:00:52.660> noob<00:00:52.960> if<00:00:53.230> you<00:00:53.350> can

00:00:53.490 --> 00:00:53.500 
to classify him as semi noob if you can

00:00:53.500 --> 00:00:55.710 
to classify him as semi noob if you can
if<00:00:53.680> you<00:00:53.740> can<00:00:53.770> call<00:00:54.100> it<00:00:54.220> that<00:00:54.250> but<00:00:54.880> narrow<00:00:55.570> rack

00:00:55.710 --> 00:00:55.720 
if you can call it that but narrow rack

00:00:55.720 --> 00:00:56.610 
if you can call it that but narrow rack
is<00:00:55.930> such<00:00:56.170> a<00:00:56.200> power

00:00:56.610 --> 00:00:56.620 
is such a power

00:00:56.620 --> 00:00:58.590 
is such a power
honestly<00:00:57.130> I<00:00:57.370> managed<00:00:57.760> to<00:00:57.820> get<00:00:57.940> to<00:00:58.060> a<00:00:58.090> plus<00:00:58.300> for

00:00:58.590 --> 00:00:58.600 
honestly I managed to get to a plus for

00:00:58.600 --> 00:01:00.210 
honestly I managed to get to a plus for
attack<00:00:58.870> in<00:00:59.020> this<00:00:59.110> game<00:00:59.380> but<00:00:59.620> that<00:00:59.920> was<00:01:00.070> not

00:01:00.210 --> 00:01:00.220 
attack in this game but that was not

00:01:00.220 --> 00:01:01.620 
attack in this game but that was not
needed<00:01:00.460> I<00:01:00.700> think<00:01:00.730> a<00:01:00.940> plus<00:01:01.120> 2<00:01:01.270> would<00:01:01.390> have<00:01:01.420> been

00:01:01.620 --> 00:01:01.630 
needed I think a plus 2 would have been

00:01:01.630 --> 00:01:03.060 
needed I think a plus 2 would have been
sufficient<00:01:01.810> but<00:01:02.500> honestly<00:01:02.770> the<00:01:02.890> only<00:01:02.920> thing

00:01:03.060 --> 00:01:03.070 
sufficient but honestly the only thing

00:01:03.070 --> 00:01:04.410 
sufficient but honestly the only thing
that<00:01:03.250> I<00:01:03.280> really<00:01:03.520> needed<00:01:03.670> was<00:01:03.790> the<00:01:04.149> speed

00:01:04.410 --> 00:01:04.420 
that I really needed was the speed

00:01:04.420 --> 00:01:05.819 
that I really needed was the speed
support<00:01:04.780> that<00:01:04.930> that's<00:01:05.079> really<00:01:05.320> what<00:01:05.500> Marik

00:01:05.819 --> 00:01:05.829 
support that that's really what Marik

00:01:05.829 --> 00:01:07.469 
support that that's really what Marik
needs<00:01:06.009> Marik<00:01:06.310> is<00:01:06.430> really<00:01:06.790> really<00:01:07.030> slow<00:01:07.270> so

00:01:07.469 --> 00:01:07.479 
needs Marik is really really slow so

00:01:07.479 --> 00:01:09.450 
needs Marik is really really slow so
when<00:01:08.049> I<00:01:08.079> got<00:01:08.229> to<00:01:08.290> my<00:01:08.470> full<00:01:08.710> speed<00:01:09.009> then<00:01:09.250> it<00:01:09.280> was

00:01:09.450 --> 00:01:09.460 
when I got to my full speed then it was

00:01:09.460 --> 00:01:11.880 
when I got to my full speed then it was
