00:00:08.850 --> 00:00:13.560
 most of the cowboy boots already 

00:00:11.220 --> 00:00:15.360
 they are not used to mount but 

00:00:13.560 --> 00:00:17.660
 originally they were designed to 

00:00:15.360 --> 00:00:17.660
 they 

00:00:18.010 --> 00:00:22.930
 to lean on the pointed stirrups 

00:00:20.440 --> 00:00:24.690
 and with slippery sole to slip 

00:00:22.930 --> 00:00:27.240
 easily 

00:00:24.690 --> 00:00:29.370
 when they had taco they were somewhat rude and they gave 

00:00:27.240 --> 00:00:31.470
 to the cowboy greater possibility of maintaining 

00:00:29.370 --> 00:00:33.590
 foot in the stirrup and not fall from the 

00:00:31.470 --> 00:00:36.020
 chair 

00:00:33.590 --> 00:00:38.570
 maybe the era of the cattle network 

00:00:36.020 --> 00:00:41.800
 has come to an end but the boots of 

00:00:38.570 --> 00:00:41.800
 cowboy are at their peak 

00:00:42.400 --> 00:00:48.090
 and the luque boots factory and yes in the 

00:00:44.710 --> 00:00:51.010
 paso texas manufactures about 900 boots a day 

00:00:48.090 --> 00:00:54.570
 and so that they look good to fashion 

00:00:51.010 --> 00:00:56.760
 It takes about 250 workers 

00:00:54.570 --> 00:00:58.920
 this sales success makes the 

00:00:56.760 --> 00:01:01.700
 Customers wish to die with their boots 

00:00:58.920 --> 00:01:01.700
 put 

00:01:02.829 --> 00:01:07.960
 the 15- day process starts at the 

00:01:05.259 --> 00:01:11.009
 leather room where there are 75 kinds of 

00:01:07.960 --> 00:01:11.009
 skins and leathers 

00:01:11.570 --> 00:01:18.060
 of snake crocodile and even of 

00:01:15.050 --> 00:01:21.450
 even more exotic animals 

00:01:18.060 --> 00:01:25.280
 this is from stingray here was the 

00:01:21.450 --> 00:01:28.789
 sting the skin is like an armor 

00:01:25.280 --> 00:01:28.789
 it always looks like the new 

00:01:30.230 --> 00:01:35.060
 the first step is to cut the skin this 

00:01:33.260 --> 00:01:36.510
 Ostrich skin will serve for two pairs 

00:01:35.060 --> 00:01:38.820
 of boots 

00:01:36.510 --> 00:01:42.240
 the worker looks for the best designs 

00:01:38.820 --> 00:01:44.280
 natural before making the cut 

00:01:42.240 --> 00:01:45.990
 these metal tools are molds 

00:01:44.280 --> 00:01:49.080
 like those used to cut 

00:01:45.990 --> 00:01:51.420
 cookies in all sizes there is one 

00:01:49.080 --> 00:01:53.430
 for each part of the boot the cane 

00:01:51.420 --> 00:01:56.640
 four fourths the upper edge the 

00:01:53.430 --> 00:01:58.320
 part that covers the foot and the heel is 

00:01:56.640 --> 00:02:00.770
 Hydraulic press cuts a couple of 

00:01:58.320 --> 00:02:00.770
 heels 

00:02:07.230 --> 00:02:14.250
 the next step is decorating the cane 

00:02:11.100 --> 00:02:17.160
 his case and he knows how to adorn a boot and 

00:02:14.250 --> 00:02:19.050
 sell it at a good price 

00:02:17.160 --> 00:02:21.720
 handmade designs cost thousands 

00:02:19.050 --> 00:02:23.070
 of dollars but the basic boot draws its 

00:02:21.720 --> 00:02:26.070
 style of a sewing machine 

00:02:23.070 --> 00:02:28.490
 automatic that gives 1200 stitches per 

00:02:26.070 --> 00:02:28.490
 minute 

00:02:33.730 --> 00:02:39.659
 the most complex designs like lightning 

00:02:36.010 --> 00:02:39.659
 of rope are made by hand 

00:02:44.890 --> 00:02:52.580
 first they put glue on the skin 

00:02:48.990 --> 00:02:54.890
 then placed in the mold 

00:02:52.580 --> 00:02:57.190
 and press with the rope to create the 

00:02:54.890 --> 00:02:57.190
 design 

00:03:09.300 --> 00:03:15.230
 on the rope they place a light skin 

00:03:11.730 --> 00:03:15.230
 and the thing in the place 

00:03:17.239 --> 00:03:22.000
 the hidden rope forms a design with 

00:03:20.189 --> 00:03:24.830
 relief 

00:03:22.000 --> 00:03:29.300
 plus 

00:03:24.830 --> 00:03:31.520
 one thing is style and another comfort like that 

00:03:29.300 --> 00:03:34.800
 that for the cowboy to be comfortable thing 

00:03:31.520 --> 00:03:37.730
 in the boot from the inside out 

00:03:34.800 --> 00:03:39.830
 trim the edges 

00:03:37.730 --> 00:03:42.670
 and alison imperfections so that 

00:03:39.830 --> 00:03:42.670
 rub the leg 

00:03:46.780 --> 00:03:50.220
 and then they turn it around 

00:03:51.020 --> 00:03:54.250
 and the soft mind 

00:03:55.960 --> 00:04:00.640
 now the old 

00:03:58.540 --> 00:04:03.370
 the pointy being no longer meets any 

00:04:00.640 --> 00:04:05.830
 function but it is fashionable 

00:04:03.370 --> 00:04:07.510
 that's why shaping is the main part 

00:04:05.830 --> 00:04:09.819
 of the process 

00:04:07.510 --> 00:04:12.659
 They use the leather and remove the water to 

00:04:09.819 --> 00:04:12.659
 to be able to work better 

00:04:15.410 --> 00:04:20.780
 and with the mouth full of nails they stretch the 

00:04:18.470 --> 00:04:24.400
 leather nailing it to the inner sole with 

00:04:20.780 --> 00:04:24.400
 one last mold in between 

00:04:29.210 --> 00:04:34.880
 now that it looks like a boot goes to 

00:04:32.449 --> 00:04:36.380
 the heat room to dry during a 

00:04:34.880 --> 00:04:39.230
 day 

00:04:36.380 --> 00:04:41.750
 at 40 degrees centigrade the heat is not 

00:04:39.230 --> 00:04:44.240
 so much in reality but it's enough 

00:04:41.750 --> 00:04:46.040
 to heal the boots it's as if you 

00:04:44.240 --> 00:04:48.380
 will remove the memory from the leather so that 

00:04:46.040 --> 00:04:51.280
 forget the shape of the animal and adopt 

00:04:48.380 --> 00:04:51.280
 a new identity 

00:04:53.120 --> 00:04:58.210
 once the form is ready you 

00:04:55.610 --> 00:05:00.819
 place the rest of the sole 

00:04:58.210 --> 00:05:03.759
 first steel edges to give 

00:05:00.819 --> 00:05:08.380
 stability and rigidity then a layer 

00:05:03.759 --> 00:05:12.270
 rigid leather inner a jig 

00:05:08.380 --> 00:05:12.270
 softer for the sole of the foot 

00:05:13.490 --> 00:05:17.870
 and finally the outer sole 

00:05:21.370 --> 00:05:29.430
 but that holds it together 

00:05:25.030 --> 00:05:29.430
 to 60 lemonwood nails 

00:05:30.400 --> 00:05:37.030
 these nails will remain in place 

00:05:33.220 --> 00:05:40.600
 because when using the boot the humidity and the 

00:05:37.030 --> 00:05:43.470
 foot heat will be adjusted and not 

00:05:40.600 --> 00:05:43.470
 they will move again 

00:05:43.980 --> 00:05:49.430
 the lemon wood makes them soft and 

00:05:46.350 --> 00:05:49.430
 comfortable for walking 

00:05:50.180 --> 00:05:54.490
 the studs are stuck and stuck 

00:05:54.780 --> 00:05:59.300
 then they fix them so that they are at the same 

00:05:57.090 --> 00:05:59.300
 level 

00:06:01.050 --> 00:06:05.650
 they put a rubber sheet on them and they paint 

00:06:03.780 --> 00:06:08.650
 the sole 

00:06:05.650 --> 00:06:11.770
 but they are not yet finished they should be 

00:06:08.650 --> 00:06:15.430
 perfect before reaching the street and 

00:06:11.770 --> 00:06:18.639
 for this purpose the seal the illustrated and 

00:06:15.430 --> 00:06:21.190
 booth flashed one pass through the tube 

00:06:18.639 --> 00:06:24.250
 heat to eliminate any wrinkles and 

00:06:21.190 --> 00:06:28.020
 are beautiful and yet so rude 

00:06:24.250 --> 00:06:28.020
 rudas that are baptized by fire 

00:06:28.600 --> 00:06:32.940
 but only to eliminate the threads 

00:06:30.460 --> 00:06:32.940
 leftovers 

00:06:33.310 --> 00:06:38.520
 and finally after 15 days of 

00:06:35.710 --> 00:06:41.039
 multiple quality controls 

00:06:38.520 --> 00:06:45.590
 These boots are ready for the cowboy 

00:06:41.039 --> 00:06:45.590
 of city or for the real mccoy
