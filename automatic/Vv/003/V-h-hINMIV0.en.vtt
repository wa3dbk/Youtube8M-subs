couple<00:01:46.590> more<00:01:47.340> pictures<00:01:47.579> that<00:01:48.479> you<00:01:48.630> don't

00:01:48.800 --> 00:01:48.810 
couple more pictures that you don't

00:01:48.810 --> 00:01:51.050 
couple more pictures that you don't
might<00:01:49.530> work<00:01:49.680> a<00:01:49.770> little<00:01:49.920> better<00:01:50.100> for<00:01:50.399> you<00:01:50.520> one

00:01:51.050 --> 00:01:51.060 
might work a little better for you one

00:01:51.060 --> 00:01:52.749 
might work a little better for you one
thing<00:01:51.210> that<00:01:51.420> I<00:01:51.479> do<00:01:51.540> want<00:01:51.930> to<00:01:51.960> show<00:01:52.170> you<00:01:52.229> is<00:01:52.530> the

00:01:52.749 --> 00:01:52.759 
thing that I do want to show you is the

00:01:52.759 --> 00:01:56.630 
thing that I do want to show you is the
vibrate<00:01:53.759> toggle<00:01:54.180> because<00:01:55.110> that<00:01:55.380> does<00:01:55.649> cut<00:01:56.520> it

00:01:56.630 --> 00:01:56.640 
vibrate toggle because that does cut it

00:01:56.640 --> 00:01:58.580 
vibrate toggle because that does cut it
a<00:01:56.759> little<00:01:56.790> bit<00:01:57.119> close<00:01:57.420> but<00:01:58.049> not<00:01:58.229> to<00:01:58.409> where<00:01:58.560> it's

00:01:58.580 --> 00:01:58.590 
a little bit close but not to where it's

00:01:58.590 --> 00:02:01.730 
a little bit close but not to where it's
an<00:01:58.799> issue<00:01:58.950> arm<00:01:59.659> again<00:02:00.659> not<00:02:01.020> the<00:02:01.170> best<00:02:01.290> camera

00:02:01.730 --> 00:02:01.740 
an issue arm again not the best camera

00:02:01.740 --> 00:02:04.280 
an issue arm again not the best camera
in<00:02:01.829> the<00:02:01.920> world<00:02:02.130> for<00:02:02.430> zoom<00:02:02.729> in<00:02:02.850> real<00:02:03.180> close<00:02:03.290> but

00:02:04.280 --> 00:02:04.290 
in the world for zoom in real close but

00:02:04.290 --> 00:02:07.190 
in the world for zoom in real close but
I'm<00:02:04.530> doing<00:02:04.799> what<00:02:04.950> I<00:02:04.979> can<00:02:05.329> so<00:02:06.329> as<00:02:06.630> you<00:02:06.810> can<00:02:06.930> see

00:02:07.190 --> 00:02:07.200 
I'm doing what I can so as you can see

00:02:07.200 --> 00:02:10.029 
I'm doing what I can so as you can see
there<00:02:07.469> the<00:02:08.009> vibrate<00:02:08.399> switch<00:02:08.610> it<00:02:08.940> does<00:02:09.239> come

00:02:10.029 --> 00:02:10.039 
there the vibrate switch it does come

00:02:10.039 --> 00:02:12.050 
there the vibrate switch it does come
towards<00:02:11.039> the<00:02:11.220> bottom<00:02:11.340> of<00:02:11.550> the<00:02:11.640> case<00:02:11.849> it

00:02:12.050 --> 00:02:12.060 
towards the bottom of the case it

00:02:12.060 --> 00:02:12.720 
towards the bottom of the case it
doesn't<00:02:12.390> touch

00:02:12.720 --> 00:02:12.730 
doesn't touch

00:02:12.730 --> 00:02:15.180
