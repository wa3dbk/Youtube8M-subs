 p 

00:00:01.189 --> 00:00:04.189
 still 

00:00:07.840 --> 00:00:11.149

00:00:11.149 --> 00:00:14.129
 France 

00:00:14.129 --> 00:00:17.919
 I think it's important for us entrepreneurs who own 

00:00:17.919 --> 00:00:22.169
 receive him without philippe guillaume and his team because it's his team 

00:00:22.859 --> 00:00:25.939
 he has daily contacts it's good war with them 

00:00:26.669 --> 00:00:31.550
 it's important that the chamber of commerce carry out great projects 

00:00:31.550 --> 00:00:34.370
 wingspan for the little net 

00:00:34.370 --> 00:00:38.750
 the mosellan at the level of heavy industry and mechanics will 

00:00:38.750 --> 00:00:39.929
 substitute 

00:00:39.929 --> 00:00:42.499
 in the world chamber of commerce especially in the development to 

00:00:42.499 --> 00:00:43.590
 International 

00:00:43.590 --> 00:00:47.170
 so much nazi time of Algeria so these two projects that were conducted 

00:00:47.740 --> 00:00:49.460
 gilles pellissier ans 

00:00:49.460 --> 00:00:51.540
 at the beginning of 2010 

00:00:51.540 --> 00:00:55.340
 for the history of territory is that the history of the mining basin is 

00:00:55.340 --> 00:00:58.570
 fashion history of the stylist will not build abymes 

00:00:59.470 --> 00:01:01.230
 guys who will get dressed 

00:01:01.230 --> 00:01:05.080
 we build a positive image of home entrepreneurs s in the 

00:01:05.080 --> 00:01:08.310
 industrial sector that's very important 

00:01:08.310 --> 00:01:11.180
 m again it is this dynamic that we must fight 

00:01:11.180 --> 00:01:15.340
 the past of dakar it's past let's stop talking about lifting the 

00:01:15.340 --> 00:01:18.640
 people talking about the future of our abilities to develop ourselves 

00:01:18.640 --> 00:01:20.090
 for that 

00:01:20.090 --> 00:01:21.620
 it is also necessary that 

00:01:21.620 --> 00:01:24.100
 all political economic actors 

00:01:24.100 --> 00:01:28.010
 this goal had alice to say our wealth of our territory 

00:01:28.009 --> 00:01:29.540
 falls on us 

00:01:29.540 --> 00:01:31.680
 that means we have to be able 

00:01:31.680 --> 00:01:33.390
 to bring to these companies 

00:01:33.390 --> 00:01:36.170
 so it's true for chambers of commerce but it's also true for 

00:01:36.170 --> 00:01:37.420
 local politics 

00:01:37.420 --> 00:01:40.680
 as to the relevance to help them raise capital for 

00:01:40.680 --> 00:01:42.550

 the shared between the first wrestling station 

00:01:57.090 --> 00:01:58.740

00:01:58.740 --> 00:02:01.110
 the regional chamber 

00:02:01.110 --> 00:02:02.570
 to be happy 

00:02:02.570 --> 00:02:05.590
