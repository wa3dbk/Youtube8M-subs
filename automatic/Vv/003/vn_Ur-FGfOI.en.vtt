have your original platform your
standard<00:00:57.300> platformer<00:00:57.870> but<00:00:58.020> we<00:00:58.649> used<00:00:58.800> to

00:00:58.849 --> 00:00:58.859 
standard platformer but we used to

00:00:58.859 --> 00:01:00.709 
standard platformer but we used to
connect<00:00:59.129> you<00:00:59.219> to<00:00:59.280> pick<00:00:59.430> up<00:00:59.550> players<00:00:59.760> and<00:01:00.149> we

connect you to pick up players and we
use<00:01:00.840> their<00:01:01.020> silhouettes<00:01:01.820> to<00:01:02.820> show<00:01:03.000> a

00:01:03.020 --> 00:01:03.030 
use their silhouettes to show a

00:01:03.030 --> 00:01:04.369 
use their silhouettes to show a
different<00:01:03.390> world<00:01:03.780> like<00:01:03.989> there<00:01:04.140> are<00:01:04.229> two

00:01:04.369 --> 00:01:04.379 
different world like there are two

00:01:04.379 --> 00:01:06.080 
different world like there are two
worlds<00:01:04.589> behind<00:01:05.070> the<00:01:05.189> original<00:01:05.610> world<00:01:05.790> and

00:01:06.080 --> 00:01:06.090 
worlds behind the original world and

00:01:06.090 --> 00:01:08.960 
worlds behind the original world and
every<00:01:06.869> silhouette<00:01:07.140> every<00:01:07.380> player<00:01:07.740> shows<00:01:08.520> the

00:01:08.960 --> 00:01:08.970

every silhouette every player shows the
other<00:01:09.119> world<00:01:09.479> and<00:01:09.780> as<00:01:10.380> you<00:01:10.590> can<00:01:10.970> with<00:01:11.970> that<00:01:12.090> you

00:01:12.230 --> 00:01:12.240 
other world and as you can with that you

00:01:12.240 --> 00:01:14.330 
other world and as you can with that you
can<00:01:12.390> make<00:01:12.540> platforms<00:01:13.080> up<00:01:13.470> here<00:01:13.830> that<00:01:14.070> are<00:01:14.189> in

00:01:14.330 --> 00:01:14.340 
can make platforms up here that are in

00:01:14.340 --> 00:01:15.679 
can make platforms up here that are in
your<00:01:14.430> robot<00:01:14.700> you<00:01:14.939> would<00:01:15.060> normally<00:01:15.150> not<00:01:15.420> see

00:01:15.679 --> 00:01:15.689 
your robot you would normally not see

00:01:15.689 --> 00:01:18.170 
your robot you would normally not see
and<00:01:15.930> then<00:01:16.590> you<00:01:17.040> have<00:01:17.159> to<00:01:17.280> get<00:01:17.790> to<00:01:17.880> the<00:01:17.970> end<00:01:18.090> of

00:01:18.170 --> 00:01:18.180 
and then you have to get to the end of

00:01:18.180 --> 00:01:19.730 
and then you have to get to the end of
the<00:01:18.270> level<00:01:18.420> which<00:01:18.570> are<00:01:18.750> shown<00:01:18.960> by<00:01:19.320> doors<00:01:19.560> now

00:01:19.730 --> 00:01:19.740 
the level which are shown by doors now

00:01:19.740 --> 00:01:21.410 
the level which are shown by doors now
which<00:01:20.130> you<00:01:20.220> have<00:01:20.310> to<00:01:20.369> go<00:01:20.520> through<00:01:20.759> so<00:01:21.299> it's

00:01:21.410 --> 00:01:21.420 
which you have to go through so it's

00:01:21.420 --> 00:01:23.390 
which you have to go through so it's
similar<00:01:21.630> in<00:01:21.780> some<00:01:21.960> ways<00:01:22.020> to<00:01:22.170> the<00:01:22.500> game<00:01:22.680> leave

00:02:16.260 --> 00:02:16.270 
computer game two of them actually

00:02:16.270 --> 00:02:17.940 
computer game two of them actually
everything<00:02:16.750> well<00:02:16.900> that<00:02:17.230> that's<00:02:17.440> pretty<00:02:17.709> good

00:02:17.940 --> 00:02:17.950 
everything well that that's pretty good

everything well that that's pretty good
that's<00:02:18.190> pretty<00:02:18.370> good<00:02:18.520> I<00:02:18.730> mean<00:02:19.330> that<00:02:19.420> we<00:02:19.510> got<00:02:19.630> a

00:02:19.650 --> 00:02:19.660 
that's pretty good I mean that we got a

00:02:19.660 --> 00:02:21.180 
that's pretty good I mean that we got a
pretty<00:02:19.840> big<00:02:20.050> market<00:02:20.350> share<00:02:20.530> I<00:02:20.770> mean<00:02:21.040> it's<00:02:21.160> a

00:02:21.180 --> 00:02:21.190 
pretty big market share I mean it's a

00:02:21.190 --> 00:02:23.850 
pretty big market share I mean it's a
shame<00:02:21.400> they<00:02:21.640> stopped<00:02:22.260> saying<00:02:23.260> the<00:02:23.500> bundle

00:02:23.850 --> 00:02:23.860 
shame they stopped saying the bundle

00:02:23.860 --> 00:02:25.290 
shame they stopped saying the bundle
with<00:02:23.980> the<00:02:24.070> Kinect<00:02:24.430> like<00:02:24.670> they<00:02:24.760> also<00:02:24.910> do<00:02:25.150> the

00:02:25.290 --> 00:02:25.300 
with the Kinect like they also do the

00:02:25.300 --> 00:02:27.330 
with the Kinect like they also do the
other<00:02:25.420> one<00:02:25.510> now<00:02:25.720> but<00:02:25.930> you<00:02:26.410> know<00:02:26.530> I<00:02:26.830> think<00:02:27.280> we

00:02:27.330 --> 00:02:27.340 
other one now but you know I think we

00:02:27.340 --> 00:02:29.100 
other one now but you know I think we
still<00:02:27.459> have<00:02:27.520> a<00:02:27.640> lot<00:02:27.730> of<00:02:27.790> users<00:02:28.030> we<00:02:28.330> can<00:02:28.480> appeal

00:02:29.100 --> 00:02:29.110 
still have a lot of users we can appeal

00:02:29.110 --> 00:02:30.780 
still have a lot of users we can appeal
to<00:02:29.140> yeah<00:02:29.860> it<00:02:29.980> feels<00:02:30.310> like<00:02:30.459> maybe<00:02:30.580> there's

00:02:30.780 --> 00:02:30.790 
to yeah it feels like maybe there's

00:02:30.790 --> 00:02:32.760 
to yeah it feels like maybe there's
gonna<00:02:30.970> be<00:02:31.120> fewer<00:02:31.390> Kinect<00:02:31.690> games<00:02:31.870> now<00:02:32.080> lets

00:02:32.760 --> 00:02:32.770 
gonna be fewer Kinect games now lets

00:02:32.770 --> 00:02:34.410 
gonna be fewer Kinect games now lets
developers<00:02:32.950> look<00:02:33.340> at<00:02:33.430> it<00:02:33.580> and<00:02:34.090> think<00:02:34.150> you<00:02:34.390> know

00:02:34.410 --> 00:02:34.420 
developers look at it and think you know

00:02:34.420 --> 00:02:35.790 
developers look at it and think you know
it's<00:02:34.630> not<00:02:34.780> packed<00:02:34.959> in<00:02:35.110> everyone<00:02:35.410> hasn't<00:02:35.590> got

00:02:35.790 --> 00:02:35.800 
it's not packed in everyone hasn't got

00:02:35.800 --> 00:02:37.410 
it's not packed in everyone hasn't got
it<00:02:35.950> so<00:02:36.160> it's<00:02:36.310> less<00:02:36.550> of<00:02:36.580> a<00:02:36.760> tangible<00:02:37.090> option

00:02:37.410 --> 00:02:37.420 
it so it's less of a tangible option

00:02:37.420 --> 00:02:39.900 
it so it's less of a tangible option
business-wise<00:02:37.870> yeah<00:02:38.769> but<00:02:39.100> I<00:02:39.130> mean<00:02:39.340> we're<00:02:39.880> kind

00:02:39.900 --> 00:02:39.910 
business-wise yeah but I mean we're kind

00:02:39.910 --> 00:02:41.850 
business-wise yeah but I mean we're kind
of<00:02:40.120> showing<00:02:40.300> what<00:02:40.959> you<00:02:41.080> can<00:02:41.230> do<00:02:41.380> with<00:02:41.560> Kinect

00:02:41.850 --> 00:02:41.860 
of showing what you can do with Kinect

00:02:41.860 --> 00:02:42.990 
of showing what you can do with Kinect
so<00:02:41.950> we're<00:02:42.070> hoping<00:02:42.370> that<00:02:42.430> maybe<00:02:42.640> we<00:02:42.880> can

00:02:42.990 --> 00:02:43.000 
so we're hoping that maybe we can

00:02:43.000 --> 00:02:45.360 
so we're hoping that maybe we can
attract<00:02:43.390> people<00:02:43.750> to<00:02:43.959> body<00:02:44.739> connect<00:02:45.010> anyway

00:02:45.360 --> 00:02:45.370 
attract people to body connect anyway

00:02:45.370 --> 00:02:46.770 
attract people to body connect anyway
because<00:02:45.640> while<00:02:45.970> we're<00:02:46.209> getting<00:02:46.570> a<00:02:46.630> lot<00:02:46.720> of

like<00:03:05.410> it's<00:03:05.590> a<00:03:05.650> game<00:03:05.800> that<00:03:05.860> would<00:03:06.070> appeal<00:03:06.280> to

00:03:06.300 --> 00:03:06.310 
like it's a game that would appeal to

00:03:06.310 --> 00:03:08.430 
like it's a game that would appeal to
families<00:03:06.489> but<00:03:06.820> also<00:03:07.030> there's<00:03:07.660> a<00:03:07.720> quite<00:03:08.170> as<00:03:08.410> a

00:03:08.430 --> 00:03:08.440 
families but also there's a quite as a

00:03:08.440 --> 00:03:10.290 
families but also there's a quite as a
hardcore<00:03:08.800> platforming<00:03:09.400> to<00:03:09.550> it<00:03:09.670> as<00:03:09.760> well<00:03:09.790> so

00:03:10.290 --> 00:03:10.300 
hardcore platforming to it as well so

00:03:10.300 --> 00:03:11.850 
hardcore platforming to it as well so
maybe<00:03:10.450> it<00:03:10.660> was<00:03:10.810> something<00:03:10.989> a<00:03:11.140> crossover<00:03:11.440> title

00:03:11.850 --> 00:03:11.860 
maybe it was something a crossover title

00:03:11.860 --> 00:03:15.000 
maybe it was something a crossover title
yeah<00:03:12.550> well<00:03:12.850> in<00:03:13.269> the<00:03:13.450> GSU<00:03:13.840> said<00:03:14.080> like<00:03:14.200> the

00:03:15.000 --> 00:03:15.010 
yeah well in the GSU said like the

00:03:15.010 --> 00:03:16.320 
yeah well in the GSU said like the
decisions<00:03:15.640> you<00:03:15.700> like<00:03:15.880> you<00:03:15.970> really<00:03:16.150> have<00:03:16.239> to

00:03:16.320 --> 00:03:16.330 
decisions you like you really have to

00:03:16.330 --> 00:03:18.180 
decisions you like you really have to
look<00:03:16.600> at<00:03:17.019> what<00:03:17.170> you're<00:03:17.290> doing<00:03:17.320> so<00:03:17.799> we<00:03:17.980> might

00:03:18.180 --> 00:03:18.190 
look at what you're doing so we might

00:03:18.190 --> 00:03:19.949 
look at what you're doing so we might
get<00:03:18.370> a<00:03:18.430> bit<00:03:18.730> more<00:03:18.910> into<00:03:19.090> the<00:03:19.180> hardcore<00:03:19.540> gamers

00:03:19.949 --> 00:03:19.959 
get a bit more into the hardcore gamers

00:03:19.959 --> 00:03:21.810 
get a bit more into the hardcore gamers
I<00:03:20.140> don't<00:03:20.530> think<00:03:20.709> you<00:03:20.830> can<00:03:20.920> well<00:03:21.459> you<00:03:21.580> can<00:03:21.700> pick

00:03:21.810 --> 00:03:21.820 
I don't think you can well you can pick

00:03:21.820 --> 00:03:23.820 
I don't think you can well you can pick
it<00:03:21.910> up<00:03:22.000> as<00:03:22.120> a<00:03:22.150> casual<00:03:22.570> game<00:03:22.720> but<00:03:23.140> it<00:03:23.620> might

00:03:23.820 --> 00:03:23.830 
it up as a casual game but it might

00:03:23.830 --> 00:03:26.070 
it up as a casual game but it might
become<00:03:24.010> a<00:03:24.160> bit<00:03:24.400> too<00:03:24.519> hard<00:03:24.790> that's

00:03:26.070 --> 00:03:26.080 
become a bit too hard that's

00:03:26.080 --> 00:03:29.010 
become a bit too hard that's
with<00:03:26.650> two<00:03:26.860> players<00:03:27.420> does<00:03:28.420> that<00:03:28.540> introduced

with two players does that introduced
free<00:03:29.290> planes<00:03:29.650> of<00:03:29.950> reality<00:03:30.000> then<00:03:31.000> with<00:03:31.330> a<00:03:31.360> freak

00:03:31.680 --> 00:03:31.690

00:03:32.820 --> 00:03:32.830 
wave because you've got their normal

00:03:32.830 --> 00:03:34.620 
wave because you've got their normal
well<00:03:33.100> then<00:03:33.190> you've<00:03:33.310> got<00:03:33.400> each<00:03:33.520> player<00:03:33.790> or<00:03:34.120> how

00:03:35.880 --> 00:03:35.890 
does that work yeah well you have your

00:03:35.890 --> 00:03:37.590 
does that work yeah well you have your
normal<00:03:36.250> platform<00:03:36.610> your<00:03:36.940> normal<00:03:37.210> layer<00:03:37.360> your

00:03:37.590 --> 00:03:37.600 
normal platform your normal layer your

00:03:37.600 --> 00:03:39.540 
normal platform your normal layer your
normal<00:03:37.840> world<00:03:37.990> and<00:03:38.260> each<00:03:38.890> player<00:03:39.160> has<00:03:39.250> their

00:03:39.540 --> 00:03:39.550 
normal world and each player has their

00:03:39.550 --> 00:03:41.400 
normal world and each player has their
own<00:03:39.610> separate<00:03:40.330> world<00:03:40.570> so<00:03:40.780> in<00:03:41.020> the<00:03:41.140> there<00:03:41.320> are

00:03:41.400 --> 00:03:41.410 
own separate world so in the there are

00:03:41.410 --> 00:03:43.320 
own separate world so in the there are
three<00:03:41.560> worlds<00:03:41.980> that<00:03:42.190> are<00:03:42.460> there<00:03:42.760> and<00:03:42.970> to<00:03:43.150> you

00:03:43.320 --> 00:03:43.330 
three worlds that are there and to you

00:03:43.330 --> 00:03:44.610 
three worlds that are there and to you
just<00:03:43.540> cannot<00:03:43.780> see<00:03:43.930> only<00:03:44.140> through<00:03:44.470> your

00:03:44.610 --> 00:03:44.620 
just cannot see only through your

00:03:44.620 --> 00:03:46.590 
just cannot see only through your
silhouette<00:03:44.890> so<00:03:45.850> to<00:03:45.910> complete<00:03:46.150> levels<00:03:46.510> you

00:03:46.590 --> 00:03:46.600 
silhouette so to complete levels you

00:03:46.600 --> 00:03:47.880 
silhouette so to complete levels you
have<00:03:46.630> to<00:03:46.810> do<00:03:46.900> all<00:03:46.930> sort<00:03:47.200> of<00:03:47.260> strange<00:03:47.440> moves<00:03:47.710> and

00:03:47.880 --> 00:03:47.890 
have to do all sort of strange moves and

00:03:47.890 --> 00:03:49.380 
have to do all sort of strange moves and
getting<00:03:48.340> out<00:03:48.430> the<00:03:48.520> way<00:03:48.610> they<00:03:48.670> each<00:03:48.850> other<00:03:49.060> and

00:03:49.380 --> 00:03:49.390 
getting out the way they each other and

00:03:49.390 --> 00:03:51.150 
getting out the way they each other and
I<00:03:49.690> guess<00:03:49.960> who's<00:03:50.140> in<00:03:50.290> front<00:03:50.380> of<00:03:50.590> each<00:03:50.680> other<00:03:50.860> is

00:03:51.150 --> 00:03:51.160 
I guess who's in front of each other is

00:03:51.160 --> 00:03:54.000 
I guess who's in front of each other is
a<00:03:52.150> factoring<00:03:52.690> we<00:03:52.780> know<00:03:52.900> how<00:03:53.230> you<00:03:53.590> then<00:03:53.860> move

00:03:54.000 --> 00:03:54.010 
a factoring we know how you then move

00:03:54.010 --> 00:03:55.500 
a factoring we know how you then move
your<00:03:54.070> character<00:03:54.370> through<00:03:54.730> the<00:03:54.820> world<00:03:54.970> yeah

00:03:55.500 --> 00:03:55.510 
your character through the world yeah

00:03:55.510 --> 00:03:57.450 
your character through the world yeah
yeah<00:03:55.720> the<00:03:56.170> one<00:03:56.290> that's<00:03:56.530> in<00:03:56.650> front<00:03:56.830> the<00:03:57.130> closest

00:03:57.450 --> 00:03:57.460 
yeah the one that's in front the closest

00:03:57.460 --> 00:03:58.470 
yeah the one that's in front the closest
to<00:03:57.520> the<00:03:57.610> kinect<00:03:57.880> like<00:03:57.970> everyone<00:03:58.240> bailed<00:03:58.420> a

00:03:58.470 --> 00:03:58.480 
to the kinect like everyone bailed a

00:03:58.480 --> 00:04:00.840 
to the kinect like everyone bailed a
person<00:03:58.780> shows<00:03:59.230> what's<00:03:59.590> there<00:03:59.860> so<00:04:00.640> you<00:04:00.700> can

00:04:00.840 --> 00:04:00.850 
person shows what's there so you can

00:04:00.850 --> 00:04:02.700 
person shows what's there so you can
actually<00:04:01.000> kind<00:04:01.720> of<00:04:01.870> screw<00:04:02.320> each<00:04:02.470> other<00:04:02.560> over

00:04:02.700 --> 00:04:02.710 
actually kind of screw each other over

00:04:02.710 --> 00:04:05.070 
actually kind of screw each other over
if<00:04:03.280> you're<00:04:03.430> in<00:04:03.520> a<00:04:03.550> funny<00:04:03.760> mood<00:04:03.850> but<00:04:04.209> just<00:04:04.390> slam

your<00:04:05.260> hand<00:04:05.410> there<00:04:05.680> and<00:04:05.800> then<00:04:05.890> you<00:04:05.980> drop<00:04:06.190> them

00:04:06.360 --> 00:04:06.370 
your hand there and then you drop them

00:04:06.370 --> 00:04:09.210 
your hand there and then you drop them
yeah<00:04:06.700> its<00:04:07.690> co-op<00:04:07.900> too<00:04:08.170> busy<00:04:08.380> it's<00:04:09.100> not
