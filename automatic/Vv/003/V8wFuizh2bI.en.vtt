am excited at the fact that it is
required<00:02:57.300> number<00:02:57.900> six<00:02:58.320> and<00:02:58.530> this<00:02:58.650> is

00:02:58.760 --> 00:02:58.770 
required number six and this is

00:02:58.770 --> 00:03:00.920 
required number six and this is
definitely<00:02:58.980> downer<00:02:59.430> for<00:02:59.580> many<00:02:59.880> people<00:03:00.060> not

00:03:00.920 --> 00:03:00.930 
definitely downer for many people not

00:03:00.930 --> 00:03:02.720 
definitely downer for many people not
myself<00:03:01.170> included<00:03:01.800> but<00:03:02.190> that's<00:03:02.340> the<00:03:02.430> fact<00:03:02.610> that

00:03:02.720 --> 00:03:02.730 
myself included but that's the fact that

00:03:02.730 --> 00:03:07.630 
myself included but that's the fact that
the<00:03:02.880> xbox<00:03:03.270> one<00:03:03.510> cannot<00:03:04.310> play<00:03:05.390> xbox<00:03:06.390> 360<00:03:07.170> games

the xbox one cannot play xbox 360 games

00:03:07.640 --> 00:03:10.580 
the xbox one cannot play xbox 360 games
so<00:03:08.640> yes<00:03:08.850> this<00:03:09.060> has<00:03:09.300> been<00:03:09.510> confirmed<00:03:09.720> the<00:03:10.230> xbox

00:03:10.580 --> 00:03:10.590

00:03:10.590 --> 00:03:14.570 
so yes this has been confirmed the xbox
one<00:03:10.860> indeed<00:03:11.400> is<00:03:11.610> not<00:03:12.510> compatible<00:03:13.110> with<00:03:13.709> old

00:03:14.570 --> 00:03:14.580

one indeed is not compatible with old
games<00:03:14.910> is<00:03:15.239> this<00:03:15.630> a<00:03:15.690> big<00:03:15.959> deal<00:03:16.310> maybe<00:03:17.330> for<00:03:18.330> me

00:03:18.440 --> 00:03:18.450 
games is this a big deal maybe for me

00:03:18.450 --> 00:03:21.320

personally<00:03:18.830> no<00:03:19.830> I<00:03:19.860> mean<00:03:20.190> when<00:03:20.940> is<00:03:21.060> the<00:03:21.180> last

00:03:21.320 --> 00:03:21.330

time<00:03:21.510> I<00:03:21.630> put<00:03:22.019> an<00:03:22.140> original<00:03:22.620> xbox<00:03:22.800> game<00:03:23.370> in<00:03:23.640> my

00:03:24.229 --> 00:03:24.239 
time I put an original xbox game in my

00:03:24.239 --> 00:03:27.590 
time I put an original xbox game in my
xbox<00:03:24.660> 360<00:03:25.200> I<00:03:25.519> honestly<00:03:26.519> can't<00:03:27.090> even<00:03:27.150> remember

00:03:27.590 --> 00:03:27.600 
xbox 360 I honestly can't even remember

00:03:27.600 --> 00:03:29.630 
xbox 360 I honestly can't even remember
so<00:03:28.019> yeah<00:03:28.170> the<00:03:28.320> fact<00:03:28.530> that<00:03:28.620> the<00:03:28.769> xbox<00:03:29.160> one<00:03:29.430> does

00:03:29.630 --> 00:03:29.640 
so yeah the fact that the xbox one does

00:03:29.640 --> 00:03:32.180 
so yeah the fact that the xbox one does
not<00:03:29.790> play<00:03:30.030> xbox<00:03:30.390> 360<00:03:30.840> games<00:03:30.959> it's<00:03:31.800> not<00:03:31.950> a<00:03:31.980> big

00:03:32.180 --> 00:03:32.190 
not play xbox 360 games it's not a big

00:03:32.190 --> 00:03:34.120 
not play xbox 360 games it's not a big
deal<00:03:32.220> and<00:03:32.610> if<00:03:32.700> i<00:03:32.790> do<00:03:32.850> want<00:03:33.150> to<00:03:33.209> play<00:03:33.360> 360<00:03:33.810> games

00:03:34.120 --> 00:03:34.130 
deal and if i do want to play 360 games

00:03:34.130 --> 00:03:36.860 
deal and if i do want to play 360 games
then<00:03:35.130> I'll<00:03:35.370> leave<00:03:35.519> my<00:03:35.670> 360<00:03:36.269> connected<00:03:36.720> and

00:03:36.860 --> 00:03:36.870 
then I'll leave my 360 connected and

00:03:36.870 --> 00:03:39.229 
then I'll leave my 360 connected and
finally<00:03:37.470> last<00:03:37.709> but<00:03:37.890> not<00:03:38.100> least<00:03:38.160> number<00:03:38.550> seven

00:03:39.229 --> 00:03:39.239 
finally last but not least number seven

00:03:39.239 --> 00:03:40.370 
finally last but not least number seven
and<00:03:39.420> this<00:03:39.600> could<00:03:39.780> definitely<00:03:39.959> be<00:03:40.260> a

00:03:40.370 --> 00:03:40.380 
and this could definitely be a

00:03:40.380 --> 00:03:42.290 
and this could definitely be a
deal-breaker<00:03:40.680> for<00:03:40.980> many<00:03:41.250> people<00:03:41.430> and<00:03:41.790> that's

00:03:42.290 --> 00:03:42.300 
deal-breaker for many people and that's

00:03:42.300 --> 00:03:44.449 
deal-breaker for many people and that's
the<00:03:42.390> fact<00:03:42.630> that<00:03:42.720> the<00:03:42.870> xbox<00:03:43.290> one<00:03:43.620> does<00:03:44.070> support

00:03:44.449 --> 00:03:44.459 
the fact that the xbox one does support

00:03:44.459 --> 00:03:48.229 
the fact that the xbox one does support
used<00:03:44.790> games<00:03:45.150> which<00:03:46.140> is<00:03:46.320> good<00:03:46.820> however<00:03:47.820> in

00:03:48.229 --> 00:03:48.239 
used games which is good however in

00:03:48.239 --> 00:03:49.910

order to play those used games you will

00:03:49.920 --> 00:03:53.090 
order to play those used games you will
have<00:03:50.070> to<00:03:50.220> pay<00:03:50.250> a<00:03:50.459> small<00:03:50.790> fee<00:03:51.480> now<00:03:51.959> this<00:03:52.590> is<00:03:52.860> not

00:03:53.090 --> 00:03:53.100 
have to pay a small fee now this is not

00:03:53.100 --> 00:03:55.280

the<00:03:53.310> smartest<00:03:53.670> approach<00:03:54.060> believe<00:03:54.870> me<00:03:55.019> I'm<00:03:55.140> not

00:03:55.280 --> 00:03:55.290 
the smartest approach believe me I'm not

00:03:55.290 --> 00:03:57.080 
the smartest approach believe me I'm not
going<00:03:55.560> to<00:03:55.650> protect<00:03:56.070> Marcus<00:03:56.280> often<00:03:56.760> this<00:03:56.940> I'm

00:03:57.080 --> 00:03:57.090 
going to protect Marcus often this I'm

00:03:57.090 --> 00:03:59.090 
going to protect Marcus often this I'm
not<00:03:57.209> going<00:03:57.390> to<00:03:57.450> defend<00:03:57.570> them<00:03:57.930> this<00:03:58.470> is<00:03:58.709> kind<00:03:59.040> of

00:03:59.090 --> 00:03:59.100 
not going to defend them this is kind of

00:03:59.100 --> 00:04:01.580 
not going to defend them this is kind of
a<00:03:59.220> stupid<00:03:59.489> move<00:03:59.880> but<00:04:00.750> at<00:04:00.930> the<00:04:01.049> end<00:04:01.080> of<00:04:01.290> the<00:04:01.380> day

00:04:01.580 --> 00:04:01.590 
a stupid move but at the end of the day

00:04:01.590 --> 00:04:03.590 
a stupid move but at the end of the day
does<00:04:02.130> it<00:04:02.280> really<00:04:02.400> matter<00:04:02.700> I<00:04:03.060> mean<00:04:03.299> how<00:04:03.540> many

00:04:03.590 --> 00:04:03.600 
does it really matter I mean how many
