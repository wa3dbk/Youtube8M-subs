 against laval 3-0 d istres succeeds very 

00:01:46.890 --> 00:01:50.719
 well against direct competitors at 

00:01:48.569 --> 00:01:50.719
 retention 

00:01:52.860 --> 00:01:57.670

 only feeds and is the 61st minute this is 

00:02:14.110 --> 00:02:17.590
 samira ben meziane who hands over 

00:02:15.880 --> 00:02:18.970
 clocks on time for the Nîmes who 

00:02:17.590 --> 00:02:22.600
 restores some hope also to 

00:02:18.970 --> 00:02:24.430
 keep his fifth goal already this season 

00:02:22.600 --> 00:02:26.620
 for his first professional season 

00:02:24.430 --> 00:02:30.630
 a balloon pushed back on his line by the 

00:02:26.620 --> 00:02:30.630
 goff but behind he can not anything 

00:02:31.860 --> 00:02:37.209
 hope of very short duration for 

00:02:34.780 --> 00:02:39.910
 victor men zvunka 67th minute beautiful 

00:02:37.209 --> 00:02:41.410
 collective action of the Istréens the pass 

00:02:39.910 --> 00:02:43.540
 in perfect recess the typing of 

00:02:41.410 --> 00:02:47.140
 malfleury also by year 30 the triplet 

00:02:43.540 --> 00:02:48.850
 for geoffrey malfleury this is the 

00:02:47.140 --> 00:02:50.800
 second hat-trick of the season in league 2 

00:02:48.850 --> 00:02:53.740
 after that of yattara at the 8th 

00:02:50.800 --> 00:02:57.160
 day for angers 5 matches with 

00:02:53.740 --> 00:02:59.739
 istres 4 goals for malfleury that gives 

00:02:57.160 --> 00:03:01.060
 two goals of advancing to the Istreans a 

00:02:59.739 --> 00:03:03.670
 very valuable success 

00:03:01.060 --> 00:03:05.709
 istres is tied with nimes but 

00:03:03.670 --> 00:03:08.250
 nevertheless remains relegated because of the 

00:03:05.709 --> 00:03:08.250
 goal difference
