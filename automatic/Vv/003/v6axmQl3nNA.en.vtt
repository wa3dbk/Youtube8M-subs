be needing just a strong stick to go

00:00:22.050 --> 00:00:54.330 
be needing just a strong stick to go
between<00:00:22.199> two<00:00:22.500> pieces<00:00:22.920> of<00:00:22.980> wood

00:00:54.330 --> 00:00:54.340 

00:00:54.340 --> 00:00:56.760 

okay<00:00:55.030> that<00:00:55.239> one's<00:00:55.390> in<00:00:55.539> now<00:00:56.320> you<00:00:56.379> get<00:00:56.530> the<00:00:56.620> other

okay that one's in now you get the other

00:00:56.770 --> 00:00:59.759 
okay that one's in now you get the other
one<00:00:57.300> okay<00:00:58.300> next<00:00:58.750> piece<00:00:58.899> will<00:00:59.050> need<00:00:59.079> to<00:00:59.469> regular

00:00:59.759 --> 00:00:59.769 
one okay next piece will need to regular

00:00:59.769 --> 00:01:02.400 
one okay next piece will need to regular
stick<00:01:00.070> that<00:01:00.850> I<00:01:00.879> put<00:01:01.660> a<00:01:01.690> point<00:01:01.989> on<00:01:02.110> that<00:01:02.290> will

00:01:02.400 --> 00:01:02.410 
stick that I put a point on that will

00:01:02.410 --> 00:01:04.619 
stick that I put a point on that will
help<00:01:02.500> it<00:01:02.649> go<00:01:02.739> into<00:01:02.920> the<00:01:02.980> ground<00:01:03.129> easier<00:01:03.629> so

00:01:04.619 --> 00:01:04.629 
help it go into the ground easier so

00:01:04.629 --> 00:01:06.600 
help it go into the ground easier so
don't<00:01:04.839> get<00:01:04.930> these<00:01:05.049> leaves<00:01:05.259> back<00:01:06.009> see<00:01:06.280> what's

00:01:06.600 --> 00:01:06.610 
don't get these leaves back see what's

00:01:06.610 --> 00:01:07.140 
don't get these leaves back see what's
going<00:01:06.820> on

00:01:07.140 --> 00:01:07.150 
going on

00:01:07.150 --> 00:01:10.620 
going on
we<00:01:08.020> set<00:01:08.229> it<00:01:08.259> right<00:01:08.409> here<00:01:09.210> and<00:01:10.210> handling<00:01:10.570> this

00:01:10.620 --> 00:01:10.630 
we set it right here and handling this

00:01:10.630 --> 00:01:22.310 
we set it right here and handling this
again<00:01:20.070> okay<00:01:21.100> I<00:01:21.310> made<00:01:21.580> the<00:01:21.670> strap<00:01:21.940> right<00:01:22.149> here

00:01:22.310 --> 00:01:22.320 
again okay I made the strap right here

00:01:22.320 --> 00:01:25.380 
again okay I made the strap right here
right<00:01:23.320> into<00:01:23.619> saplings<00:01:24.280> so<00:01:24.430> I'm<00:01:24.700> just<00:01:24.850> pull<00:01:25.060> set

00:01:25.380 --> 00:01:25.390 
right into saplings so I'm just pull set

00:01:25.390 --> 00:01:26.070 
right into saplings so I'm just pull set
them<00:01:25.600> down

00:01:26.070 --> 00:01:26.080 
them down

00:01:26.080 --> 00:01:29.100 
them down
Thomas<00:01:26.950> tree<00:01:27.160> -<00:01:27.429> it<00:01:27.610> is<00:01:27.850> then<00:01:28.330> pulled<00:01:28.720> it<00:01:28.869> and

00:01:29.100 --> 00:01:29.110 
Thomas tree - it is then pulled it and

00:01:29.110 --> 00:01:30.270 
Thomas tree - it is then pulled it and
put<00:01:29.289> the<00:01:29.410> other<00:01:29.500> end<00:01:29.679> of<00:01:29.710> the<00:01:29.800> strings<00:01:30.100> in<00:01:30.220> the

00:01:30.270 --> 00:01:30.280 
put the other end of the strings in the

00:01:30.280 --> 00:01:32.520 
put the other end of the strings in the
trap<00:01:30.550> and<00:01:30.820> that's<00:01:31.570> what<00:01:31.750> gives<00:01:31.929> the<00:01:32.110> pole<00:01:32.320> on

00:01:32.520 --> 00:01:32.530 
trap and that's what gives the pole on

00:01:32.530 --> 00:01:36.120 
trap and that's what gives the pole on
the<00:01:32.560> trap<00:01:32.920> so<00:01:33.610> on<00:01:33.850> we<00:01:34.810> get<00:01:34.990> the<00:01:35.229> sum<00:01:35.770> of<00:01:35.800> string

00:01:36.120 --> 00:01:36.130 
the trap so on we get the sum of string

00:01:36.130 --> 00:01:45.520 
the trap so on we get the sum of string
tied<00:01:36.340> to<00:01:36.369> this<00:01:36.580> and<00:01:36.820> right<00:01:37.030> back<00:01:37.210> with<00:01:37.420> you

00:01:45.520 --> 00:01:45.530 

00:01:45.530 --> 00:01:46.859 

you

00:01:46.859 --> 00:01:46.869 
you

00:01:46.869 --> 00:01:48.810 
you
I<00:01:46.900> found<00:01:47.530> the<00:01:47.619> proper<00:01:47.979> length<00:01:48.130> I<00:01:48.340> need<00:01:48.549> from

00:01:48.810 --> 00:01:48.820 
I found the proper length I need from

00:01:48.820 --> 00:01:50.399 
I found the proper length I need from
the<00:01:49.000> tree<00:01:49.240> to<00:01:49.270> the<00:01:49.479> trap<00:01:49.840> get<00:01:50.140> the<00:01:50.260> right

00:01:50.399 --> 00:01:50.409 
the tree to the trap get the right

00:01:50.409 --> 00:01:51.930 
the tree to the trap get the right
tension<00:01:50.650> point<00:01:51.130> and<00:01:51.369> I<00:01:51.400> would<00:01:51.460> touched<00:01:51.760> a

00:01:51.930 --> 00:01:51.940 
tension point and I would touched a

00:01:51.940 --> 00:01:54.630 
tension point and I would touched a
small<00:01:52.210> stick<00:01:53.010> to<00:01:54.010> the<00:01:54.100> rope<00:01:54.310> that<00:01:54.490> was<00:01:54.580> tied

00:01:54.630 --> 00:01:54.640 
small stick to the rope that was tied

00:01:54.640 --> 00:02:02.010 
small stick to the rope that was tied
from<00:01:54.970> the<00:01:55.060> tree<00:01:59.520> and<00:02:00.630> the<00:02:01.630> going<00:02:01.810> to<00:02:01.930> be

00:02:02.010 --> 00:02:02.020 
from the tree and the going to be

00:02:02.020 --> 00:02:03.780 
from the tree and the going to be
sliding<00:02:02.290> that<00:02:02.530> small<00:02:02.830> stick<00:02:03.130> under<00:02:03.520> another

00:02:03.780 --> 00:02:03.790 
sliding that small stick under another

00:02:03.790 --> 00:02:30.680 
sliding that small stick under another
stake<00:02:04.119> as<00:02:04.360> demonstrated

00:02:30.680 --> 00:02:30.690 

00:02:30.690 --> 00:02:33.150 

and<00:02:31.690> now<00:02:31.870> what<00:02:32.020> I'm<00:02:32.110> doing<00:02:32.410> is<00:02:32.530> making<00:02:32.560> a<00:02:32.950> noose

00:02:33.150 --> 00:02:33.160 
and now what I'm doing is making a noose

00:02:33.160 --> 00:02:34.740 
and now what I'm doing is making a noose
with<00:02:33.490> that<00:02:33.700> will<00:02:33.850> be<00:02:33.940> set<00:02:34.210> right<00:02:34.240> underneath

00:02:34.740 --> 00:02:34.750 
with that will be set right underneath

00:02:34.750 --> 00:03:02.340 
with that will be set right underneath
the<00:02:34.990> triggering<00:02:35.350> system

00:03:02.340 --> 00:03:02.350 

00:03:02.350 --> 00:03:05.770 

okay<00:03:03.350> I<00:03:03.650> have<00:03:04.400> my<00:03:04.850> tree<00:03:05.090> bent<00:03:05.360> over<00:03:05.540> right

00:03:05.770 --> 00:03:05.780 
okay I have my tree bent over right

00:03:05.780 --> 00:03:12.340 
okay I have my tree bent over right
there<00:03:06.430> with<00:03:07.430> a<00:03:07.460> string<00:03:07.880> tied<00:03:09.040> to<00:03:10.040> it<00:03:11.080> this<00:03:12.080> goes

00:03:12.340 --> 00:03:12.350 
there with a string tied to it this goes

00:03:12.350 --> 00:03:17.500 
there with a string tied to it this goes
down<00:03:12.620> to<00:03:13.190> the<00:03:13.280> treasure<00:03:13.550> stick<00:03:14.230> and<00:03:16.360> to<00:03:17.360> the

00:03:17.500 --> 00:03:17.510 
down to the treasure stick and to the

00:03:17.510 --> 00:03:25.180 
down to the treasure stick and to the
snare<00:03:18.020> so<00:03:23.110> then<00:03:24.110> comes<00:03:24.440> along<00:03:24.680> and<00:03:24.800> steps<00:03:25.040> um

00:03:25.180 --> 00:03:25.190 
snare so then comes along and steps um

00:03:25.190 --> 00:03:27.430 
snare so then comes along and steps um
stick<00:03:25.810> this<00:03:26.810> is<00:03:26.960> what<00:03:27.140> should<00:03:27.260> hopefully

00:03:27.430 --> 00:03:27.440 
stick this is what should hopefully

00:03:27.440 --> 00:03:43.390 
stick this is what should hopefully
happen<00:03:31.330> okay

00:03:43.390 --> 00:03:43.400 

00:03:43.400 --> 00:03:45.920 

okay<00:03:44.400> another<00:03:44.760> way<00:03:44.970> you<00:03:45.030> can<00:03:45.240> do<00:03:45.390> this<00:03:45.600> is<00:03:45.900> if

00:03:45.920 --> 00:03:45.930 
okay another way you can do this is if

00:03:45.930 --> 00:03:48.440 
okay another way you can do this is if
you<00:03:46.290> don't<00:03:46.500> want<00:03:46.680> to<00:03:46.770> pull<00:03:46.920> down<00:03:47.069> a<00:03:47.130> tree<00:03:47.610> you

00:03:48.440 --> 00:03:48.450 
you don't want to pull down a tree you

00:03:48.450 --> 00:03:49.970 
you don't want to pull down a tree you
can<00:03:48.720> just<00:03:48.930> take<00:03:49.110> your<00:03:49.140> string<00:03:49.500> and<00:03:49.530> toss<00:03:49.770> it

00:03:49.970 --> 00:03:49.980 
can just take your string and toss it

00:03:49.980 --> 00:03:52.100 
can just take your string and toss it
over<00:03:50.190> a<00:03:50.220> limb<00:03:50.580> make<00:03:51.360> sure<00:03:51.510> it's<00:03:51.660> strong<00:03:51.870> enough

00:03:52.100 --> 00:03:52.110 
over a limb make sure it's strong enough

00:03:52.110 --> 00:03:55.699
