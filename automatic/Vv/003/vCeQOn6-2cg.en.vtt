great<00:01:02.940> for<00:01:03.149> memory<00:01:03.449> because<00:01:03.719> if<00:01:03.809> you<00:01:04.019> don't

00:01:04.429 --> 00:01:04.439 
great for memory because if you don't

00:01:04.439 --> 00:01:06.830

and where the turn is and stuff like

00:01:08.400 --> 00:01:10.010 
and where the turn is and stuff like
that<00:01:08.460> then<00:01:09.090> you<00:01:09.210> can<00:01:09.240> actually<00:01:09.390> concentrating
