00:00:38.660 --> 00:00:38.670 
blue tape represents broken or detuned

00:00:38.670 --> 00:00:54.740 
blue tape represents broken or detuned
keys<00:00:51.739> and<00:00:52.739> zip<00:00:53.550> ties<00:00:53.820> are<00:00:54.090> holding<00:00:54.449> the<00:00:54.539> keys

00:00:54.740 --> 00:00:54.750 
keys and zip ties are holding the keys

00:00:54.750 --> 00:01:19.880 
keys and zip ties are holding the keys
on<00:00:54.930> because<00:00:55.230> they<00:00:55.379> don't<00:00:55.559> fit<00:00:55.739> the<00:00:55.860> frame<00:01:18.890> this

00:01:19.880 --> 00:01:19.890 
on because they don't fit the frame this

00:01:19.890 --> 00:01:23.240 
on because they don't fit the frame this
is<00:01:20.070> our<00:01:20.220> fiber<00:01:20.580> it<00:01:21.299> falls<00:01:22.110> apart<00:01:22.560> and<00:01:22.830> we<00:01:22.979> have

00:01:23.240 --> 00:01:23.250 
is our fiber it falls apart and we have

00:01:23.250 --> 00:01:26.030 
is our fiber it falls apart and we have
to<00:01:23.460> knit<00:01:24.030> bracelets<00:01:24.630> and<00:01:24.869> use<00:01:25.080> zip<00:01:25.320> ties<00:01:25.560> to

00:01:26.030 --> 00:01:26.040 
to knit bracelets and use zip ties to

00:01:26.040 --> 00:01:28.760 
to knit bracelets and use zip ties to
keep<00:01:26.220> the<00:01:26.520> petal<00:01:26.820> on<00:01:26.970> and<00:01:27.270> keep<00:01:27.479> it<00:01:27.630> intact<00:01:28.049> but

00:01:28.760 --> 00:01:28.770 
keep the petal on and keep it intact but

00:01:28.770 --> 00:01:31.039 
keep the petal on and keep it intact but
they<00:01:28.890> break<00:01:29.159> like<00:01:29.400> once<00:01:29.610> a<00:01:29.759> week<00:01:29.790> also<00:01:30.450> it

00:01:31.039 --> 00:01:31.049 
they break like once a week also it

00:01:31.049 --> 00:01:39.580 
they break like once a week also it
sounds<00:01:31.290> like<00:01:31.439> a<00:01:31.560> snare<00:01:31.860> drum

00:01:39.580 --> 00:01:39.590 

00:01:39.590 --> 00:01:43.010 

this<00:01:40.590> vibraphone<00:01:41.159> constantly<00:01:41.850> rains<00:01:42.090> and<00:01:42.840> the

00:01:43.010 --> 00:01:43.020 
this vibraphone constantly rains and the

00:01:43.020 --> 00:02:11.410 
this vibraphone constantly rains and the
petal<00:01:43.350> moves<00:01:43.560> around

00:02:11.410 --> 00:02:11.420 

00:02:11.420 --> 00:02:14.780 

and<00:02:12.680> five-year-old<00:02:13.680> heads<00:02:13.920> are<00:02:14.130> just<00:02:14.310> bad

00:02:14.780 --> 00:02:14.790 
and five-year-old heads are just bad

00:02:14.790 --> 00:02:38.420 
and five-year-old heads are just bad
just<00:02:15.450> it<00:02:15.780> says<00:02:15.960> bad<00:02:16.170> right<00:02:16.350> there<00:02:16.380> and<00:02:37.040> and<00:02:38.040> so

00:02:38.420 --> 00:02:38.430 
just it says bad right there and and so

00:02:38.430 --> 00:02:39.530 
just it says bad right there and and so
it<00:02:38.580> gets<00:02:38.730> lower<00:02:38.970> and<00:02:39.060> lower<00:02:39.150> weight<00:02:39.450> to

00:02:39.530 --> 00:02:39.540 
it gets lower and lower weight to

00:02:39.540 --> 00:02:41.330 
it gets lower and lower weight to
replace<00:02:39.900> this<00:02:40.080> like<00:02:40.290> five<00:02:40.560> times<00:02:40.830> the<00:02:40.980> season

00:02:41.330 --> 00:02:41.340 
replace this like five times the season

00:02:41.340 --> 00:02:59.810 
replace this like five times the season
and<00:02:41.670> the<00:02:42.090> brakes<00:02:42.300> don't<00:02:42.540> really<00:02:42.959> work

00:02:59.810 --> 00:02:59.820 

00:02:59.820 --> 00:03:03.870 

so<00:03:00.820> these<00:03:01.060> are<00:03:01.330> our<00:03:01.680> suspended<00:03:02.680> symbols<00:03:03.250> this

00:03:03.870 --> 00:03:03.880

00:03:22.290 --> 00:03:22.300 
but it's purple enough to match the Xylo

but it's purple enough to match the Xylo
at<00:03:22.480> this<00:03:22.660> point<00:03:31.260> this<00:03:32.260> one's<00:03:32.560> kind<00:03:32.920> of<00:03:33.010> the

00:03:33.120 --> 00:03:33.130 
at this point this one's kind of the

00:03:33.130 --> 00:03:46.450 
at this point this one's kind of the
same<00:03:33.400> deal<00:03:35.400> and<00:03:36.480> it's<00:03:37.480> all<00:03:37.630> warped<00:03:37.959> and<00:03:38.290> sad

00:03:46.450 --> 00:03:46.460 

00:03:46.460 --> 00:03:50.390 

this<00:03:47.460> one<00:03:47.670> has<00:03:47.820> a<00:03:47.850> huge<00:03:48.770> crack<00:03:49.770> in<00:03:49.800> it<00:03:50.100> and<00:03:50.310> we

00:03:50.390 --> 00:03:50.400 
this one has a huge crack in it and we

00:03:50.400 --> 00:03:54.290 
this one has a huge crack in it and we
had<00:03:50.580> to<00:03:50.730> use<00:03:51.950> we<00:03:52.950> had<00:03:53.040> to<00:03:53.160> drill<00:03:53.430> holes<00:03:53.760> to<00:03:54.030> stop

00:03:54.290 --> 00:03:54.300 
had to use we had to drill holes to stop

00:04:22.850 --> 00:04:26.660 

held<00:04:23.850> together<00:04:24.120> by<00:04:24.950> electrical<00:04:25.950> tape<00:04:26.340> and

00:04:26.660 --> 00:04:26.670 
held together by electrical tape and

00:04:26.670 --> 00:04:35.860 
held together by electrical tape and
then<00:04:27.480> our<00:04:27.750> other<00:04:27.960> set

00:04:35.860 --> 00:04:35.870

it's weighted way wrong and has a couple
times<00:04:42.260> missing<00:04:42.800> but<00:04:43.310> this<00:04:43.460> is<00:04:43.580> the<00:04:43.700> best<00:04:43.850> we

all four years of marching band and our

00:05:07.570 --> 00:05:09.270 
all four years of marching band and our
percussion<00:05:07.870> section<00:05:08.260> could<00:05:08.620> sound<00:05:08.830> a<00:05:08.949> lot

00:05:09.270 --> 00:05:09.280 
percussion section could sound a lot

00:05:09.280 --> 00:05:12.650 
percussion section could sound a lot
better<00:05:09.669> if<00:05:09.850> we<00:05:09.910> had<00:05:10.000> some<00:05:10.090> better<00:05:10.389> equipment

00:05:12.650 --> 00:05:12.660 

00:05:12.660 --> 00:05:15.659 

my<00:05:13.660> name<00:05:13.840> is<00:05:13.960> will<00:05:14.229> and<00:05:14.620> Mickey<00:05:15.250> has<00:05:15.460> always

00:05:15.669 --> 00:05:20.189 
my name is will and Mickey has always
been<00:05:15.970> a<00:05:16.300> huge<00:05:17.169> asset<00:05:17.470> to<00:05:17.830> the<00:05:17.949> band<00:05:18.750> so<00:05:19.750> I<00:05:20.050> think

00:05:20.189 --> 00:05:20.199 
been a huge asset to the band so I think

00:05:20.199 --> 00:05:21.840 
been a huge asset to the band so I think
that<00:05:20.560> she's<00:05:20.740> doing<00:05:20.889> a<00:05:21.100> great<00:05:21.280> job<00:05:21.340> and<00:05:21.790> that

00:05:21.840 --> 00:05:21.850 
that she's doing a great job and that

00:05:21.850 --> 00:05:24.300 
that she's doing a great job and that
our<00:05:22.840> percussion<00:05:23.139> section<00:05:23.530> really<00:05:23.919> deserves
