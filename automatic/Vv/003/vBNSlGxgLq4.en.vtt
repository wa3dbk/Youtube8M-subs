this<00:00:19.439> is<00:00:19.740> a<00:00:19.800> function<00:00:20.460> that<00:00:20.490> it<00:00:20.939> was

00:00:21.230 --> 00:00:21.240 
this is a function that it was

this is a function that it was

work<00:00:53.850> on<00:00:54.210> some<00:00:54.690> processes<00:00:55.320> but<00:00:55.739> there<00:00:56.010> is<00:00:56.129> a

00:00:56.150 --> 00:00:56.160 
work on some processes but there is a

00:00:56.160 --> 00:00:58.189 
work on some processes but there is a
pretty<00:00:56.670> high<00:00:56.879> chance<00:00:56.910> with<00:00:57.390> with<00:00:57.750> this<00:00:57.930> stuff

00:00:58.189 --> 00:00:58.199 
pretty high chance with with this stuff

00:00:58.199 --> 00:01:01.250 
pretty high chance with with this stuff
that<00:00:58.410> with<00:00:58.649> the<00:00:58.800> processor<00:00:59.219> I<00:00:59.250> am<00:00:59.550> using<00:01:00.260> now

00:01:01.250 --> 00:01:01.260 
that with the processor I am using now

00:01:01.260 --> 00:01:02.450 
that with the processor I am using now
let's<00:01:01.500> turn<00:01:01.649> the<00:01:01.770> computer<00:01:02.160> on

00:01:02.450 --> 00:01:02.460 
let's turn the computer on

00:01:02.460 --> 00:01:08.899 
let's turn the computer on
oh<00:01:04.189> and

00:01:08.899 --> 00:01:08.909 

00:01:08.909 --> 00:01:12.599 

as<00:01:09.909> I<00:01:10.210> said<00:01:10.450> I'm<00:01:10.689> using<00:01:10.929> a<00:01:11.109> gigabyte<00:01:11.500> board<00:01:11.609> and

00:01:12.599 --> 00:01:12.609 
as I said I'm using a gigabyte board and

00:01:12.609 --> 00:01:14.550 
as I said I'm using a gigabyte board and
I<00:01:12.700> using<00:01:13.030> the<00:01:13.119> MDF<00:01:13.600> on<00:01:13.810> the<00:01:14.049> second<00:01:14.320> generation

00:01:14.550 --> 00:01:14.560 
I using the MDF on the second generation

00:01:14.560 --> 00:01:22.850 
I using the MDF on the second generation
x3<00:01:15.509> 452<00:01:16.509> buyouts<00:01:19.829> I'll<00:01:20.829> do<00:01:21.159> its<00:01:21.310> post<00:01:21.610> jerk

00:01:22.850 --> 00:01:22.860 
x3 452 buyouts I'll do its post jerk

00:01:22.860 --> 00:01:28.800 
x3 452 buyouts I'll do its post jerk
okay<00:01:23.860> so<00:01:25.770> see<00:01:26.770> standard<00:01:27.250> CMOS<00:01:27.549> up<00:01:27.819> utility<00:01:28.090> the

00:01:28.800 --> 00:01:28.810 
okay so see standard CMOS up utility the

00:01:28.810 --> 00:01:30.569 
okay so see standard CMOS up utility the

00:01:30.569 --> 00:01:30.579 
the main function that we're going to be

00:01:30.579 --> 00:01:32.309 
the main function that we're going to be

using actually only functional gonna be

00:01:32.319 --> 00:01:34.709 
using actually only functional gonna be
using<00:01:32.619> is<00:01:32.740> the<00:01:33.399> MB<00:01:33.909> intelligent<00:01:34.420> weaker

00:01:34.709 --> 00:01:34.719 
using is the MB intelligent weaker

00:01:34.719 --> 00:01:38.010

otherwise known as MIT now that's at
that<00:01:38.250> now<00:01:39.250> yes<00:01:40.239> my<00:01:40.539> system<00:01:40.989> voltage<00:01:41.140> is<00:01:41.619> not

that now yes my system voltage is not

00:01:42.039 --> 00:01:44.910 
that now yes my system voltage is not
optimized<00:01:43.000> but<00:01:43.539> that<00:01:43.899> is<00:01:44.079> not<00:01:44.289> important<00:01:44.860> in

optimized but that is not important in

00:01:44.920 --> 00:01:46.319 
optimized but that is not important in
this<00:01:44.979> case<00:01:45.189> because<00:01:45.250> I'm<00:01:45.789> using<00:01:46.030> a

00:01:46.319 --> 00:01:46.329 
this case because I'm using a

00:01:46.329 --> 00:01:49.380 
this case because I'm using a
non-default<00:01:46.750> voltage<00:01:47.909> now<00:01:48.909> we're<00:01:49.179> going<00:01:49.329> to

00:01:49.380 --> 00:01:49.390 
non-default voltage now we're going to

00:01:49.390 --> 00:01:52.169 
non-default voltage now we're going to
go<00:01:49.509> to<00:01:49.569> the<00:01:49.689> advanced<00:01:49.929> clock<00:01:50.229> calibration<00:01:51.179> now

00:01:52.169 --> 00:01:52.179 
go to the advanced clock calibration now

00:01:52.179 --> 00:01:54.679 
go to the advanced clock calibration now
I<00:01:52.239> like<00:01:52.569> to<00:01:52.780> use<00:01:52.989> the<00:01:53.259> EC<00:01:53.649> firmware<00:01:54.069> section<00:01:54.280> in

00:01:54.679 --> 00:01:54.689 
I like to use the EC firmware section in

00:01:54.689 --> 00:01:58.609 
I like to use the EC firmware section in
hybrid<00:01:55.689> mode<00:01:56.250> also<00:01:57.250> you<00:01:57.670> will<00:01:57.880> need<00:01:58.060> to

00:01:58.609 --> 00:01:58.619 
hybrid mode also you will need to

00:01:58.619 --> 00:02:01.979 
hybrid mode also you will need to
uncheck<00:01:59.819> uncheck<00:02:00.819> disable<00:02:01.030> modal<00:02:01.689> advanced

00:02:01.979 --> 00:02:01.989

I<00:02:05.349> use<00:02:05.590> the<00:02:05.739> value<00:02:06.039> of<00:02:06.159> negative<00:02:06.489> 2%<00:02:07.149> to<00:02:07.929> keep

00:02:08.100 --> 00:02:08.110 
I use the value of negative 2% to keep

00:02:09.869 --> 00:02:09.879 
it stable also you're going to need to

00:02:09.879 --> 00:02:13.789 
it stable also you're going to need to
