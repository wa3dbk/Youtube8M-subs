00:00:00.760 --> 00:00:08.570
 Yes this plan is 

00:00:05.500 --> 00:00:12.470
 Shape of this collar foot 

00:00:08.570 --> 00:00:15.730
 The type is 12345 

00:00:12.470 --> 00:00:17.410
 For the time being 5 

00:00:15.730 --> 00:00:19.810
 I have it 

00:00:17.410 --> 00:00:23.200
 That area 4 

00:00:19.810 --> 00:00:24.830
 Let me remember the shape 

00:00:23.200 --> 00:00:27.930
 Well 

00:00:24.830 --> 00:00:30.140
 Shiro souvenirs are their own 

00:00:27.930 --> 00:00:33.310
 Shape of the large neck 

00:00:30.140 --> 00:00:33.310
 What do you like 

00:00:33.740 --> 00:00:39.190
 Ask me to see what the difference is 

00:00:41.520 --> 00:00:45.770
 This time 

00:00:43.480 --> 00:00:48.850
 Subarurote 

00:00:45.770 --> 00:00:48.850
 Will do 

00:00:54.579 --> 00:00:57.510
 The tail is 

00:00:59.380 --> 00:01:04.480
 This entry is 

00:01:02.460 --> 00:01:06.030
 When the beat was 

00:01:04.480 --> 00:01:09.090
 Hey school 

00:01:06.030 --> 00:01:10.830
 About the angle 

00:01:09.090 --> 00:01:12.600
 Mitsui 

00:01:10.830 --> 00:01:14.900
 This will be long 

00:01:12.600 --> 00:01:17.980
 Here also becomes long here 

00:01:14.900 --> 00:01:17.980
 It is a style 

00:01:20.540 --> 00:01:25.850
 A little 

00:01:22.740 --> 00:01:28.280
 Because there is also a later style 

00:01:25.850 --> 00:01:30.820
 A little longer 

00:01:28.280 --> 00:01:30.820
 Cut 

00:01:32.370 --> 00:01:35.060
 Angle Ha' 

00:01:36.640 --> 00:01:40.930
 Where I followed 

00:01:39.190 --> 00:01:43.750
 From 

00:01:40.930 --> 00:01:47.910
 In the case of the first hand his finger 

00:01:43.750 --> 00:01:47.910
 About 1 duty 

00:01:50.659 --> 00:01:56.060
 It does lower the angle a little 

00:01:53.490 --> 00:01:58.280
 Finger 

00:01:56.060 --> 00:02:02.500
 Width 

00:01:58.280 --> 00:02:02.500
 I will cut it down a little 

00:02:33.930 --> 00:02:40.650
 This time a little upper length 

00:02:37.959 --> 00:02:40.650
 Or in a bottle 

00:02:41.710 --> 00:02:49.860
 From the place that caused waiting to for the scalp 

00:02:46.410 --> 00:02:55.250
 Little to about 45 degrees 

00:02:49.860 --> 00:03:00.120
 I told you that the upper length will remain longer 

00:02:55.250 --> 00:03:02.780
 From the place of this three key all the front is behind 

00:03:00.120 --> 00:03:02.780
 Disappear 

00:03:17.140 --> 00:03:21.630
 Above the Liberal Democratic Party 

00:03:19.950 --> 00:03:23.660
 The elite 

00:03:21.630 --> 00:03:26.480
 Forgive me 

00:03:23.660 --> 00:03:29.230
 40 came back 

00:03:26.480 --> 00:03:29.230
 Oh you the crust the crust the crust the crust the crust 

00:03:35.690 --> 00:03:42.100
 Blow a little lightly 

00:03:39.250 --> 00:03:44.430
 In but it was a little blow 

00:03:42.100 --> 00:03:47.020
 The mauss lowtail is 

00:03:44.430 --> 00:03:50.460
 In such Fu 

00:03:47.020 --> 00:03:53.640
 The right side is short 

00:03:50.460 --> 00:03:55.900
 The left side gets longer 

00:03:53.640 --> 00:04:02.730
 Well this 

00:03:55.900 --> 00:04:02.730
 I'd become the place before edge of the Bob and the remains go before 

00:04:04.330 --> 00:04:10.440
 Because there is no good part of love Swallowtail if it is this, it is a little 

00:04:10.470 --> 00:04:17.010
 Light longer 

00:04:13.990 --> 00:04:17.010
 I will hurry up 

00:04:20.769 --> 00:04:22.769
 Hmm 

00:04:23.450 --> 00:04:30.080
 It is a common day for everything 

00:04:26.490 --> 00:04:32.919
 I pulled it out against the scalp 

00:04:30.080 --> 00:04:34.180
 The nice thing about Swallowtail 

00:04:32.919 --> 00:04:37.660
 put out 

00:04:34.180 --> 00:04:41.160
 Layer day 

00:04:37.660 --> 00:04:41.160
 I will put in overall 

00:04:56.129 --> 00:05:00.960
 Say for example this 

00:04:58.030 --> 00:05:00.960
 Usually that 

00:05:01.650 --> 00:05:09.169
 c Even when putting the chopsticks 

00:05:05.009 --> 00:05:09.169
 This last after 

00:05:09.630 --> 00:05:16.669
 The last term as a fifth place leader 

00:05:13.529 --> 00:05:16.669
 I can not put in too much 

00:05:19.700 --> 00:05:26.330
 The reason machine 

00:05:22.700 --> 00:05:30.190
 line itself is so much this 

00:05:26.330 --> 00:05:32.640
 If the total blur is too much 

00:05:30.190 --> 00:05:32.640
 Something 

00:05:34.620 --> 00:05:38.150
 Crappy feeling of 

00:05:39.280 --> 00:05:43.200
 Because it looks like a tile 

00:05:47.510 --> 00:05:50.830
 A while ago 

00:05:48.860 --> 00:05:53.470
 Oite taking 

00:05:50.830 --> 00:05:55.169
 No. 4 

00:05:53.470 --> 00:05:58.720
 Hmm 

00:05:55.169 --> 00:06:03.310
 It is if you rush ahead 

00:05:58.720 --> 00:06:06.750
 Even if you hurry with scissors you usually lay further 

00:06:03.310 --> 00:06:06.750
 This doing d 

00:06:09.470 --> 00:06:14.350
 let me in 

00:06:11.720 --> 00:06:14.350
 Or put 

00:06:14.370 --> 00:06:17.150
 To do 

00:06:18.910 --> 00:06:25.720
 In Nets and Kinoeyubi 

00:06:21.480 --> 00:06:28.520
 Skill Masami Day to lift a little 

00:06:25.720 --> 00:06:31.200
 Because it is on the layer 

00:06:28.520 --> 00:06:35.080
 It will lift a little 

00:06:31.200 --> 00:06:36.889
 So good place for swallowtail 

00:06:35.080 --> 00:06:38.580
 Say this 

00:06:36.889 --> 00:06:42.230
 Sharp 

00:06:38.580 --> 00:06:45.689
 The line that will be emphasized 

00:06:42.230 --> 00:06:47.370
 If the original that will come out is that 

00:06:45.689 --> 00:06:49.669
 The other a little Koeeee 

00:06:47.370 --> 00:06:49.669
 Already 

00:06:49.680 --> 00:06:53.940
 At the time of cut 

00:06:51.400 --> 00:06:55.689
 It would be cool if I cut it in 

00:06:53.940 --> 00:06:58.050
 The next 

00:06:55.689 --> 00:06:59.980
 Because there is a style 

00:06:58.050 --> 00:07:02.090
 This time 

00:06:59.980 --> 00:07:04.169
 with this 

00:07:02.090 --> 00:07:07.129
 Swallowtail 

00:07:04.169 --> 00:07:07.129
 It was introduction of
