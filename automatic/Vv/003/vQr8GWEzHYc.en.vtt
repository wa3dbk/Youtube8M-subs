00:03:13.580 --> 00:03:13.590 
anything like that then they would then

00:03:13.590 --> 00:03:14.870 
anything like that then they would then
the<00:03:13.680> price<00:03:13.860> would<00:03:14.010> go<00:03:14.040> up<00:03:14.100> to<00:03:14.220> six<00:03:14.430> bucks<00:03:14.640> and

00:03:14.870 --> 00:03:14.880 
the price would go up to six bucks and

00:03:14.880 --> 00:03:16.220 
the price would go up to six bucks and
that<00:03:15.000> person<00:03:15.330> would<00:03:15.450> always<00:03:15.570> get<00:03:15.750> precedent

00:03:16.220 --> 00:03:16.230 
that person would always get precedent

00:03:16.230 --> 00:03:18.230 
that person would always get precedent
as<00:03:16.380> long<00:03:16.530> as<00:03:16.710> as<00:03:17.040> long<00:03:17.070> as<00:03:17.340> they<00:03:17.460> pay<00:03:17.700> six<00:03:17.970> bucks

00:03:18.230 --> 00:03:18.240 
as long as as long as they pay six bucks

00:03:18.240 --> 00:03:19.340 
as long as as long as they pay six bucks
if<00:03:18.420> they<00:03:18.570> don't<00:03:18.720> want<00:03:18.870> a<00:03:18.930> sponsor<00:03:19.110> an<00:03:19.290> episode

00:03:19.340 --> 00:03:19.350 
if they don't want a sponsor an episode

00:03:19.350 --> 00:03:21.140 
if they don't want a sponsor an episode
then<00:03:20.070> it<00:03:20.160> would<00:03:20.250> go<00:03:20.370> back<00:03:20.490> down<00:03:20.670> to<00:03:20.730> five<00:03:20.940> bucks

00:03:21.140 --> 00:03:21.150 
then it would go back down to five bucks

00:03:21.150 --> 00:03:24.320 
then it would go back down to five bucks
so<00:03:21.390> the<00:03:21.750> price<00:03:21.990> is<00:03:22.230> at<00:03:22.770> five<00:03:23.220> bucks<00:03:23.550> but<00:03:23.790> it's

00:03:24.320 --> 00:03:24.330 
so the price is at five bucks but it's

00:03:24.330 --> 00:03:25.760 
so the price is at five bucks but it's
very<00:03:24.600> likely<00:03:24.810> to<00:03:25.020> grow<00:03:25.200> I've<00:03:25.410> had<00:03:25.560> a<00:03:25.590> lot<00:03:25.740> of

00:03:25.760 --> 00:03:25.770 
very likely to grow I've had a lot of

00:03:25.770 --> 00:03:27.880 
very likely to grow I've had a lot of
people<00:03:26.010> seem<00:03:26.160> interested<00:03:26.610> in<00:03:26.700> sponsoring

00:03:27.880 --> 00:03:27.890 
people seem interested in sponsoring

00:03:27.890 --> 00:03:31.100 
people seem interested in sponsoring
podcasts<00:03:28.890> and<00:03:29.040> so<00:03:29.550> this<00:03:29.850> could<00:03:30.150> be<00:03:30.330> a<00:03:30.570> great

00:03:31.100 --> 00:03:31.110 
podcasts and so this could be a great
