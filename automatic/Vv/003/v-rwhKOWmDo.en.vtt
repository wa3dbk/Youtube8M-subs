my mother trouble it's gonna be one
single<00:00:34.860> dt<00:00:35.390> in<00:00:36.390> flash<00:00:36.660> my<00:00:36.870> still<00:00:37.079> actually

00:00:37.190 --> 00:00:37.200 
single dt in flash my still actually

00:00:37.200 --> 00:00:39.799 
single dt in flash my still actually
managed<00:00:37.469> to<00:00:37.530> hold<00:00:37.770> it<00:00:37.950> off<00:00:38.070> if<00:00:38.309> he<00:00:38.550> go<00:00:39.540> in<00:00:39.570> from

00:00:39.799 --> 00:00:39.809 
managed to hold it off if he go in from

00:00:39.809 --> 00:00:41.330 
managed to hold it off if he go in from
vulture<00:00:40.050> out<00:00:40.140> they're<00:00:40.260> gonna<00:00:40.469> also<00:00:40.770> expand

00:00:41.330 --> 00:00:41.340 
vulture out they're gonna also expand

00:00:41.340 --> 00:00:42.770 
vulture out they're gonna also expand
and<00:00:41.640> i<00:00:41.700> think<00:00:41.940> if<00:00:42.030> he<00:00:42.090> goes<00:00:42.210> from<00:00:42.360> mines<00:00:42.629> he

00:00:42.770 --> 00:00:42.780 
and i think if he goes from mines he

00:00:42.780 --> 00:00:44.569 
and i think if he goes from mines he
will<00:00:43.079> hold<00:00:43.230> this<00:00:43.350> back<00:00:43.559> fairly<00:00:43.950> nicely<00:00:44.250> gonna

00:00:44.569 --> 00:00:44.579 
will hold this back fairly nicely gonna

00:00:44.579 --> 00:00:48.170 
will hold this back fairly nicely gonna
get<00:00:44.760> his<00:00:44.879> natural<00:00:45.690> expo<00:00:46.050> going<00:00:46.730> and<00:00:47.730> he's<00:00:48.030> in<00:00:48.120> a

Templars going to be coming out but with
only<00:00:57.570> one<00:00:57.690> gate<00:00:58.020> would<00:00:58.140> be<00:00:58.230> produced<00:00:58.530> i'm<00:00:58.649> not

00:00:58.790 --> 00:00:58.800 
only one gate would be produced i'm not

00:00:58.800 --> 00:01:00.139 
only one gate would be produced i'm not
quite<00:00:58.949> sure<00:00:58.980> whether<00:00:59.280> he's<00:00:59.699> gonna<00:00:59.879> be<00:00:59.969> able<00:01:00.030> to

00:01:00.139 --> 00:01:00.149 
quite sure whether he's gonna be able to

00:01:00.149 --> 00:01:02.029 
quite sure whether he's gonna be able to
get<00:01:00.239> enough<00:01:00.480> done<00:01:00.660> there<00:01:00.840> is<00:01:01.050> no<00:01:01.590> detection

00:01:02.029 --> 00:01:02.039 
get enough done there is no detection

00:01:02.039 --> 00:01:03.650 
get enough done there is no detection
for<00:01:02.340> flash<00:01:02.550> i<00:01:02.820> think<00:01:03.030> he's<00:01:03.120> still<00:01:03.329> waiting<00:01:03.600> on

00:01:03.650 --> 00:01:03.660 
for flash i think he's still waiting on

00:01:03.660 --> 00:01:05.299 
for flash i think he's still waiting on
his<00:01:03.809> mind<00:01:04.049> mines<00:01:04.409> might<00:01:04.650> save<00:01:04.890> the<00:01:05.010> day<00:01:05.100> has<00:01:05.280> a

00:01:05.299 --> 00:01:05.309 
his mind mines might save the day has a

00:01:05.309 --> 00:01:06.770 
his mind mines might save the day has a
couple<00:01:05.519> of<00:01:05.640> orchards<00:01:05.970> out<00:01:06.090> there<00:01:06.299> now

00:01:06.770 --> 00:01:06.780 
couple of orchards out there now

00:01:06.780 --> 00:01:08.149 
couple of orchards out there now
planning<00:01:07.170> the<00:01:07.409> mind<00:01:07.619> since<00:01:07.860> you're<00:01:07.979> going<00:01:08.070> to

00:01:08.149 --> 00:01:08.159 
planning the mind since you're going to

00:01:08.159 --> 00:01:09.590

trust<00:01:08.369> in<00:01:08.520> his<00:01:08.610> mind's<00:01:08.820> to<00:01:09.000> save<00:01:09.180> himself<00:01:09.360> I

00:01:09.590 --> 00:01:09.600 
trust in his mind's to save himself I

00:01:09.600 --> 00:01:12.469 
trust in his mind's to save himself I
think<00:01:09.630> flash<00:01:10.049> actually<00:01:10.380> just<00:01:11.360> neglecting<00:01:12.360> the

00:01:12.469 --> 00:01:12.479 
think flash actually just neglecting the

00:01:12.479 --> 00:01:14.359 
think flash actually just neglecting the
detection<00:01:12.780> on<00:01:13.020> purpose<00:01:13.500> knows<00:01:14.010> that<00:01:14.250> if<00:01:14.340> he

00:01:14.359 --> 00:01:14.369 
detection on purpose knows that if he

00:01:14.369 --> 00:01:15.679 
detection on purpose knows that if he
has<00:01:14.520> no<00:01:14.670> spines<00:01:14.970> out<00:01:15.150> there's<00:01:15.390> gonna<00:01:15.509> be<00:01:15.600> able
