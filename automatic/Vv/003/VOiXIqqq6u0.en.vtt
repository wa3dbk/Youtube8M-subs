00:00:01.080 --> 00:00:06.610
 Hello everyone and in this video I invite 

00:00:03.489 --> 00:00:09.610
 cook you with me soft 

00:00:06.610 --> 00:00:11.369
 creamy melted cheese in a slow cooker 

00:00:09.610 --> 00:00:16.209
 and for its preparation we will need 

00:00:11.369 --> 00:00:19.810
 I have milk 3 liters of milk 

00:00:16.209 --> 00:00:21.880
 try to take exactly fat from me 32 

00:00:19.810 --> 00:00:28.140
 percent but you can take fatter when 

00:00:21.880 --> 00:00:32.079
 wish and a jar of sour cream sour cream too 

00:00:28.140 --> 00:00:36.190
 it is desirable to take and the fatter the better 

00:00:32.079 --> 00:00:39.550
 and at the very end for souring our 

00:00:36.190 --> 00:00:43.570
 soft cheese, we need 1 lemon 

00:00:39.550 --> 00:00:46.079
 and first of all pour all the milk into 

00:00:43.570 --> 00:00:46.079
 multicooker bowl 

00:00:46.370 --> 00:00:56.660
 then I close the bowl multicooker and 

00:00:50.390 --> 00:00:56.660
 I put it on heating mode 

00:01:00.410 --> 00:01:07.110
 rather, first I need to warm up 

00:01:04.430 --> 00:01:10.229
 the content that is milk to the desired 

00:01:07.110 --> 00:01:14.180
 I will warm up the temperature 

00:01:10.229 --> 00:01:18.770
 such a state from a little hot 

00:01:14.180 --> 00:01:21.940
 and after our milk got a little 

00:01:18.770 --> 00:01:26.800
 hot there we need to lay out 

00:01:21.940 --> 00:01:26.800
 a jar of sour cream bowl multicooker 

00:01:33.409 --> 00:01:40.819
 and I close the slow cooker and the whole 

00:01:38.149 --> 00:01:45.979
 day I put it on the heating mode 

00:01:40.819 --> 00:01:49.729
 There is such a mode 

00:01:45.979 --> 00:01:53.149
 preheating and we need to wait 

00:01:49.729 --> 00:01:55.069
 until the milk is baked ie 

00:01:53.149 --> 00:01:59.929
 she will get that golden hue 

00:01:55.069 --> 00:02:03.140
 and melted taste well, about you 

00:01:59.929 --> 00:02:06.189
 leave it somewhere you can 12:00 

00:02:03.140 --> 00:02:06.189
 put on all night 

00:02:06.330 --> 00:02:14.860
 so we have our milk in the evening 

00:02:09.100 --> 00:02:17.770
 drowned for 12 hours and now it's time 

00:02:14.860 --> 00:02:21.640
 paint it 

00:02:17.770 --> 00:02:24.150
 with lemon juice and for this 

00:02:21.640 --> 00:02:27.600
 goals we need accordingly 

00:02:24.150 --> 00:02:31.850
 fresh lemon juice 

00:02:27.600 --> 00:02:31.850
 now stir constantly 

00:02:32.710 --> 00:02:48.000
 I pour our lemon juice in the ghee 

00:02:40.270 --> 00:02:48.000
 milk and stir it all well 

00:02:52.450 --> 00:02:58.900
 and here you see that I have milk 

00:02:55.780 --> 00:03:01.540
 is a cheesy table and now its 

00:02:58.900 --> 00:03:03.220
 can be folded on the sieve if 

00:03:01.540 --> 00:03:06.340
 you see that you have no milk 

00:03:03.220 --> 00:03:08.130
 it collapses then it means that little 

00:03:06.340 --> 00:03:11.950
 you lemon juice freshly squeezed 

00:03:08.130 --> 00:03:14.870
 added add more 

00:03:11.950 --> 00:03:18.290
 so I just filtered through a sieve 

00:03:14.870 --> 00:03:22.250
 our soft cheese is such a large amount 

00:03:18.290 --> 00:03:24.620
 I got enough and also 

00:03:22.250 --> 00:03:29.420
 add salt to taste 

00:03:24.620 --> 00:03:31.940
 a little bit of garlic here I have a connection 

00:03:29.420 --> 00:03:34.430
 frozen parsley 

00:03:31.940 --> 00:03:36.740
 But you can leave it in principle 

00:03:34.430 --> 00:03:40.570
 I just want to see this time 

00:03:36.740 --> 00:03:43.820
 try adding more spices and 

00:03:40.570 --> 00:03:46.290
 then I will weigh and say how much I have 

00:03:43.820 --> 00:03:53.040
 turned out by weight 

00:03:46.290 --> 00:03:57.090
 and that product yield was 650 

00:03:53.040 --> 00:04:00.079
 grams of soft creamy melted 

00:03:57.090 --> 00:04:00.079
 cheese 

00:04:00.240 --> 00:04:07.260
 and our soft cream cheese i will 

00:04:04.140 --> 00:04:08.270
 store for two to three days in 

00:04:07.260 --> 00:04:13.070
 the fridge 

00:04:08.270 --> 00:04:17.520
 accordingly I will screw our 

00:04:13.070 --> 00:04:19.290
 capacity lid here we are actually in 

00:04:17.520 --> 00:04:21.930
 for two or three days it is kept very 

00:04:19.290 --> 00:04:23.400
 well longer basically he has us 

00:04:21.930 --> 00:04:27.090
 never stale 

00:04:23.400 --> 00:04:30.150
 and by the way wanted to say about the spice 

00:04:27.090 --> 00:04:31.910
 Here I am for the rule put 5 cloves 

00:04:30.150 --> 00:04:34.920
 garlic 

00:04:31.910 --> 00:04:37.440
 bunch of parsley green sea salt and 

00:04:34.920 --> 00:04:41.280
 added to taste and get very 

00:04:37.440 --> 00:04:44.850
 very tasty very similar to cheese 

00:04:41.280 --> 00:04:50.820
 hochland almette and here it is us 

00:04:44.850 --> 00:04:52.740
 filler with a variety of such was 

00:04:50.820 --> 00:04:56.130
