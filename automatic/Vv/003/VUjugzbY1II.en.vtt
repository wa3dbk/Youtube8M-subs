artifacts<00:01:55.259> would<00:01:55.439> just<00:01:55.619> drive<00:01:55.829> you<00:01:55.979> crazy

00:01:56.090 --> 00:01:56.100 
artifacts would just drive you crazy

00:01:56.100 --> 00:01:58.069 
artifacts would just drive you crazy
let's<00:01:56.490> see<00:01:56.640> lettering<00:01:57.030> it<00:01:57.810> would<00:01:57.899> just<00:01:58.020> be

00:01:58.069 --> 00:01:58.079 
let's see lettering it would just be

00:01:58.079 --> 00:02:00.859 
let's see lettering it would just be
like<00:01:58.170> you<00:01:58.579> would<00:01:59.579> see<00:01:59.909> it<00:02:00.149> literally

00:02:00.859 --> 00:02:00.869 
like you would see it literally

00:02:00.869 --> 00:02:02.899 
like you would see it literally
flickering<00:02:01.649> like<00:02:01.770> mad<00:02:02.009> and<00:02:02.340> you<00:02:02.460> can't<00:02:02.729> do

00:02:02.899 --> 00:02:02.909 
flickering like mad and you can't do

00:02:02.909 --> 00:02:05.510 
flickering like mad and you can't do
that<00:02:03.090> so<00:02:03.869> what<00:02:04.530> you're<00:02:04.890> basically<00:02:04.920> saying

00:02:05.510 --> 00:02:05.520 
that so what you're basically saying

00:02:05.520 --> 00:02:07.999 
that so what you're basically saying
that<00:02:05.640> movie<00:02:06.390> theater<00:02:06.659> projectors<00:02:07.560> don't

00:02:07.999 --> 00:02:08.009 
that movie theater projectors don't

00:02:08.009 --> 00:02:10.730 
that movie theater projectors don't
projected<00:02:08.729> 24<00:02:09.210> frames<00:02:09.509> per<00:02:09.630> second<00:02:10.140> oh<00:02:10.229> no<00:02:10.410> it

00:02:10.730 --> 00:02:10.740 
projected 24 frames per second oh no it

00:02:10.740 --> 00:02:12.110 
projected 24 frames per second oh no it
would<00:02:10.860> drive<00:02:11.009> our<00:02:11.160> going<00:02:11.340> batty<00:02:11.550> and<00:02:11.819> leave

00:02:12.110 --> 00:02:12.120 
would drive our going batty and leave

00:02:12.120 --> 00:02:13.340 
would drive our going batty and leave
the<00:02:12.330> screen<00:02:12.450> you<00:02:12.630> can't<00:02:12.810> leave<00:02:12.960> the<00:02:13.110> movie

00:02:13.340 --> 00:02:13.350 
the screen you can't leave the movie

00:02:13.350 --> 00:02:14.890 
the screen you can't leave the movie
theater<00:02:13.590> so<00:02:13.710> what<00:02:13.860> they<00:02:13.980> do<00:02:14.040> is<00:02:14.400> a<00:02:14.430> cool<00:02:14.670> trick

00:02:14.890 --> 00:02:14.900 
theater so what they do is a cool trick

00:02:14.900 --> 00:02:17.930 
theater so what they do is a cool trick
even<00:02:15.900> with<00:02:15.990> film<00:02:16.260> projectors<00:02:17.040> they<00:02:17.490> actually

00:02:17.930 --> 00:02:17.940 
even with film projectors they actually

00:02:17.940 --> 00:02:20.390 
even with film projectors they actually
hold<00:02:18.150> that<00:02:18.420> frame<00:02:18.810> that<00:02:19.230> frame<00:02:19.710> of<00:02:19.860> film<00:02:20.010> still

00:02:20.390 --> 00:02:20.400 
hold that frame that frame of film still

00:02:20.400 --> 00:02:22.700 
hold that frame that frame of film still
and<00:02:20.640> flash<00:02:21.150> it<00:02:21.330> twice<00:02:21.600> or<00:02:21.870> three<00:02:22.290> times<00:02:22.530> in

00:02:22.700 --> 00:02:22.710 
and flash it twice or three times in

00:02:22.710 --> 00:02:23.670 
and flash it twice or three times in
some<00:02:22.830> cases<00:02:23.100> they<00:02:23.340> have<00:02:23.370> like

00:02:23.670 --> 00:02:23.680 
some cases they have like

00:02:23.680 --> 00:02:25.709 
some cases they have like
Gator<00:02:23.980> that<00:02:24.280> whirling<00:02:24.760> shutter<00:02:25.090> they<00:02:25.269> totally

00:02:25.709 --> 00:02:25.719 
Gator that whirling shutter they totally

00:02:25.719 --> 00:02:27.479 
Gator that whirling shutter they totally
and<00:02:25.900> this<00:02:26.140> helps<00:02:26.469> eliminate<00:02:26.560> that<00:02:27.040> pulsing

00:02:27.479 --> 00:02:27.489 
and this helps eliminate that pulsing

00:02:27.489 --> 00:02:29.490 
and this helps eliminate that pulsing
that<00:02:27.609> flicker<00:02:27.969> artifact<00:02:28.569> and<00:02:28.780> if<00:02:29.140> they<00:02:29.260> didn't

00:02:29.490 --> 00:02:29.500 
that flicker artifact and if they didn't

00:02:29.500 --> 00:02:30.509 
that flicker artifact and if they didn't
like<00:02:29.530> I<00:02:29.680> said<00:02:29.829> it<00:02:29.950> would<00:02:30.010> just<00:02:30.069> be<00:02:30.250> like<00:02:30.370> I

00:02:30.509 --> 00:02:30.519 
like I said it would just be like I

00:02:30.519 --> 00:02:32.880 
like I said it would just be like I
cannot<00:02:31.090> view<00:02:31.420> this<00:02:31.629> now<00:02:32.170> when<00:02:32.469> you<00:02:32.560> talk<00:02:32.680> about

televisions that's where it all kind of

00:02:38.739 --> 00:02:40.259 
televisions that's where it all kind of
started<00:02:39.189> there's<00:02:39.670> a<00:02:39.700> lot<00:02:39.819> of<00:02:39.939> reasoning

00:02:40.259 --> 00:02:40.269 
started there's a lot of reasoning

00:02:40.269 --> 00:02:42.240 
started there's a lot of reasoning
behind<00:02:40.420> that<00:02:40.599> buddy<00:02:40.930> SC<00:02:41.379> 60<00:02:41.920> frames<00:02:42.129> per

it's<00:02:44.709> not<00:02:44.799> in<00:02:44.920> feel<00:02:45.129> it's<00:02:45.370> not<00:02:45.489> an<00:02:45.639> even

00:02:45.929 --> 00:02:45.939 
it's not in feel it's not an even

it's not in feel it's not an even

an artifact can occur whereas because

00:02:50.920 --> 00:02:52.530 
an artifact can occur whereas because
we're<00:02:51.310> trying<00:02:51.489> to<00:02:51.549> shove<00:02:51.790> a<00:02:51.819> square<00:02:52.209> peg<00:02:52.359> into

we're trying to shove a square peg into

00:02:55.610 --> 00:02:55.620 
a round hole with them with the contents

00:02:55.620 --> 00:02:57.899 
a round hole with them with the contents
brain<00:02:56.620> wave<00:02:56.799> or<00:02:56.980> refresh<00:02:57.579> rate<00:02:57.790> of<00:02:57.819> the

00:02:59.729 --> 00:02:59.739 
display movies going to 60 Hertz it's

00:02:59.739 --> 00:03:02.009 
display movies going to 60 Hertz it's
like<00:02:59.889> two<00:03:00.159> and<00:03:00.340> a<00:03:00.370> half<00:03:00.609> times<00:03:00.970> 24<00:03:01.599> frames<00:03:01.900> per

00:03:02.009 --> 00:03:02.019 
like two and a half times 24 frames per

00:03:02.019 --> 00:03:03.929 
like two and a half times 24 frames per
second<00:03:02.530> so<00:03:02.889> you<00:03:02.980> get<00:03:03.069> stuff<00:03:03.280> like<00:03:03.340> 3:2

00:03:03.929 --> 00:03:03.939 
second so you get stuff like 3:2

00:03:03.939 --> 00:03:05.580

totally<00:03:06.220> took<00:03:06.430> to<00:03:06.609> make<00:03:06.760> it<00:03:06.909> fit<00:03:07.120> you<00:03:07.329> have<00:03:07.480> to

00:03:07.589 --> 00:03:07.599 
totally took to make it fit you have to

00:03:07.599 --> 00:03:09.390 
totally took to make it fit you have to
do<00:03:07.720> some<00:03:07.870> crazy<00:03:08.049> mix<00:03:08.620> up<00:03:08.769> like<00:03:08.950> that<00:03:09.159> to<00:03:09.310> make

00:03:09.390 --> 00:03:09.400 
do some crazy mix up like that to make

00:03:09.400 --> 00:03:11.190 
do some crazy mix up like that to make
it<00:03:09.459> work<00:03:09.549> and<00:03:09.879> it<00:03:10.120> does<00:03:10.299> take<00:03:10.569> away<00:03:10.810> some<00:03:11.169> of

00:03:11.190 --> 00:03:11.200 
it work and it does take away some of

00:03:11.200 --> 00:03:14.610 
it work and it does take away some of
the<00:03:11.370> cinema<00:03:12.370> quality<00:03:12.909> of<00:03:13.090> how<00:03:13.419> the<00:03:14.139> look<00:03:14.469> of

00:03:14.610 --> 00:03:14.620 
the cinema quality of how the look of

00:03:14.620 --> 00:03:16.679 
the cinema quality of how the look of
the<00:03:14.709> video<00:03:14.799> experience<00:03:15.189> is<00:03:15.489> so<00:03:16.180> with<00:03:16.569> the

00:03:16.679 --> 00:03:16.689 
the video experience is so with the

00:03:16.689 --> 00:03:19.679 
the video experience is so with the
advent<00:03:17.079> of<00:03:17.200> 120<00:03:17.829> Hertz<00:03:18.040> TVs<00:03:18.489> and<00:03:18.760> even<00:03:19.209> plasma

00:03:19.679 --> 00:03:19.689 
advent of 120 Hertz TVs and even plasma

00:03:19.689 --> 00:03:22.500 
advent of 120 Hertz TVs and even plasma
TVs<00:03:20.049> that<00:03:20.200> will<00:03:20.349> run<00:03:20.530> it's<00:03:20.680> a<00:03:20.889> 72<00:03:21.609> Hertz<00:03:21.819> or<00:03:21.969> 96

00:03:22.500 --> 00:03:22.510 
TVs that will run it's a 72 Hertz or 96

00:03:22.510 --> 00:03:24.420 
TVs that will run it's a 72 Hertz or 96
Hertz<00:03:22.719> I<00:03:22.930> think<00:03:23.290> some<00:03:23.500> might<00:03:23.650> even<00:03:23.799> run<00:03:23.980> at<00:03:24.099> 120

00:03:24.420 --> 00:03:24.430 
Hertz I think some might even run at 120

00:03:24.430 --> 00:03:26.250 
Hertz I think some might even run at 120
Hertz<00:03:24.819> now<00:03:25.030> but<00:03:25.599> those<00:03:25.750> are<00:03:25.870> all<00:03:25.959> even

00:03:26.250 --> 00:03:26.260 
Hertz now but those are all even

00:03:26.260 --> 00:03:28.550 
Hertz now but those are all even

00:03:28.550 --> 00:03:28.560 
multiples of 24 so it allows you then to

00:03:28.560 --> 00:03:31.619 
multiples of 24 so it allows you then to
flash<00:03:29.560> the<00:03:29.829> picture<00:03:30.190> multiple<00:03:30.669> times<00:03:30.940> but

flash the picture multiple times but

00:03:31.629 --> 00:03:33.659 
flash the picture multiple times but
still<00:03:31.900> keep<00:03:32.229> that<00:03:32.409> cadence<00:03:32.919> right<00:03:33.190> that<00:03:33.400> looks

00:03:33.659 --> 00:03:33.669 
still keep that cadence right that looks

00:03:33.669 --> 00:03:34.409 
still keep that cadence right that looks
