there's a huge problem that apparently
blue<00:00:30.179> side<00:00:30.480> is<00:00:30.660> getting<00:00:30.689> more<00:00:31.170> XP<00:00:31.710> than<00:00:31.920> purple

blue side is getting more XP than purple

00:00:32.130 --> 00:00:36.110 
blue side is getting more XP than purple
side<00:00:32.489> now<00:00:33.390> this<00:00:33.899> has<00:00:34.079> been<00:00:34.280> like<00:00:35.280> confirmed<00:00:35.910> by

00:00:36.110 --> 00:00:36.120 
side now this has been like confirmed by

00:00:36.120 --> 00:00:38.209 
side now this has been like confirmed by
read<00:00:36.329> posts<00:00:36.719> and<00:00:36.899> I<00:00:37.469> don't<00:00:37.860> really<00:00:37.950> know<00:00:38.100> how

many of you guys have seen this or heard

00:00:40.079 --> 00:00:41.420 
many of you guys have seen this or heard
of<00:00:40.170> this<00:00:40.290> so<00:00:40.860> I'm<00:00:40.980> just<00:00:41.010> going<00:00:41.219> to<00:00:41.280> go<00:00:41.370> through

00:00:41.420 --> 00:00:41.430 
of this so I'm just going to go through

00:00:41.430 --> 00:00:43.520 
of this so I'm just going to go through
and<00:00:41.700> like<00:00:42.239> show<00:00:42.600> you<00:00:42.660> basically<00:00:43.050> how<00:00:43.140> it's

00:00:43.520 --> 00:00:43.530 
and like show you basically how it's

00:00:43.530 --> 00:00:45.799 
and like show you basically how it's
it's<00:00:44.040> actually<00:00:44.399> true<00:00:44.550> so<00:00:44.879> we're<00:00:45.329> on<00:00:45.450> blue<00:00:45.629> side

00:00:45.799 --> 00:00:45.809 
it's actually true so we're on blue side

00:00:45.809 --> 00:00:47.000 
it's actually true so we're on blue side
right<00:00:45.989> now<00:00:46.110> so<00:00:46.350> I'm<00:00:46.469> just<00:00:46.590> going<00:00:46.710> to<00:00:46.770> clear

00:00:47.000 --> 00:00:47.010 
right now so I'm just going to clear

00:00:47.010 --> 00:00:48.590 
right now so I'm just going to clear
this<00:00:47.129> wave<00:00:47.340> I'm<00:00:48.090> going<00:00:48.210> to<00:00:48.270> get<00:00:48.360> to<00:00:48.450> like

00:00:48.590 --> 00:00:48.600 
this wave I'm going to get to like

00:00:48.600 --> 00:00:50.330 
this wave I'm going to get to like
probably<00:00:48.809> level<00:00:49.140> I'm<00:00:49.829> gonna<00:00:49.950> probably<00:00:50.100> clear

00:00:50.330 --> 00:00:50.340 
probably level I'm gonna probably clear

00:00:50.340 --> 00:00:53.389 
probably level I'm gonna probably clear
like<00:00:50.520> three<00:00:50.850> or<00:00:50.969> four<00:00:51.000> waves<00:00:51.710> just<00:00:52.710> to<00:00:52.890> see<00:00:53.100> and

00:00:53.389 --> 00:00:53.399 
like three or four waves just to see and

00:00:53.399 --> 00:00:55.670 
like three or four waves just to see and
then<00:00:53.760> write<00:00:53.940> down<00:00:54.090> that<00:00:54.239> number<00:00:54.420> and<00:00:54.750> then

00:00:55.670 --> 00:00:55.680 
then write down that number and then

00:00:55.680 --> 00:00:57.319 
then write down that number and then
we'll<00:00:55.860> see<00:00:56.039> what<00:00:56.430> it<00:00:56.460> matches<00:00:56.850> up<00:00:56.879> to<00:00:57.120> on<00:00:57.239> the

00:00:57.319 --> 00:00:57.329 
we'll see what it matches up to on the

00:00:57.329 --> 00:00:58.790 
we'll see what it matches up to on the
other<00:00:57.480> side<00:00:57.629> now<00:00:57.780> apparently<00:00:58.079> it's<00:00:58.230> just<00:00:58.620> the

00:00:58.790 --> 00:00:58.800 
other side now apparently it's just the

00:00:58.800 --> 00:00:59.990 
other side now apparently it's just the
melee<00:00:59.160> minions<00:00:59.370> that<00:00:59.579> are<00:00:59.670> giving<00:00:59.940> a

00:00:59.990 --> 00:01:00.000 
melee minions that are giving a

00:01:00.000 --> 00:01:01.880 
melee minions that are giving a
different<00:01:00.390> number<00:01:00.660> of<00:01:00.690> XP<00:01:01.109> on<00:01:01.260> blue<00:01:01.469> side<00:01:01.680> and

00:01:01.880 --> 00:01:01.890 
different number of XP on blue side and

00:01:01.890 --> 00:01:04.939 
different number of XP on blue side and
I'd<00:01:02.520> imagine<00:01:03.120> it's<00:01:03.270> a<00:01:03.329> pretty<00:01:03.539> core<00:01:04.170> component

00:01:04.939 --> 00:01:04.949 
I'd imagine it's a pretty core component

00:01:04.949 --> 00:01:06.859 
I'd imagine it's a pretty core component
of<00:01:05.070> their<00:01:05.250> system<00:01:05.760> based<00:01:06.299> on<00:01:06.510> the<00:01:06.600> fact<00:01:06.780> that

00:01:06.859 --> 00:01:06.869 
of their system based on the fact that

00:01:06.869 --> 00:01:10.640 
of their system based on the fact that
it<00:01:07.020> hasn't<00:01:07.200> been<00:01:07.409> fixed<00:01:07.650> yet<00:01:09.170> like<00:01:10.170> you'd

00:01:10.640 --> 00:01:10.650 
it hasn't been fixed yet like you'd

00:01:10.650 --> 00:01:12.740 
it hasn't been fixed yet like you'd
think<00:01:10.860> if<00:01:11.070> it's<00:01:11.220> if<00:01:11.610> it's<00:01:11.850> I<00:01:12.030> easy<00:01:12.240> to<00:01:12.420> fix<00:01:12.600> like

00:01:12.740 --> 00:01:12.750 
think if it's if it's I easy to fix like

00:01:12.750 --> 00:01:14.030 
think if it's if it's I easy to fix like
just<00:01:12.960> a<00:01:13.049> quick<00:01:13.229> little<00:01:13.260> hot<00:01:13.590> fix<00:01:13.830> that<00:01:13.950> would

00:01:14.030 --> 00:01:14.040 
just a quick little hot fix that would

00:01:14.040 --> 00:01:15.620 
just a quick little hot fix that would
have<00:01:14.130> already<00:01:14.250> done<00:01:14.490> it<00:01:14.549> so<00:01:15.180> the<00:01:15.299> fact<00:01:15.509> that

00:01:15.620 --> 00:01:15.630 
have already done it so the fact that

00:01:15.630 --> 00:01:17.600 
have already done it so the fact that
it's<00:01:15.810> not<00:01:15.930> fixed<00:01:16.380> yet<00:01:16.409> I<00:01:16.500> imagine<00:01:17.400> it's

00:01:17.600 --> 00:01:17.610 
it's not fixed yet I imagine it's

00:01:17.610 --> 00:01:20.810 
it's not fixed yet I imagine it's
because<00:01:18.030> they<00:01:18.680> it's<00:01:19.680> a<00:01:19.830> pretty<00:01:20.009> big<00:01:20.250> fix<00:01:20.640> it's

00:01:20.810 --> 00:01:20.820 
because they it's a pretty big fix it's

00:01:20.820 --> 00:01:23.539 
because they it's a pretty big fix it's
not<00:01:20.939> just<00:01:21.119> like<00:01:21.240> an<00:01:21.360> instant<00:01:22.189> instant<00:01:23.189> fix

00:01:23.539 --> 00:01:23.549 
not just like an instant instant fix

00:01:23.549 --> 00:01:28.539 
not just like an instant instant fix
thing

00:01:28.539 --> 00:01:28.549 

00:01:28.549 --> 00:01:30.590 

not<00:01:29.549> really<00:01:29.759> focusing<00:01:30.150> on<00:01:30.299> last<00:01:30.450> fitting

00:01:30.590 --> 00:01:30.600 
not really focusing on last fitting

00:01:30.600 --> 00:01:31.640 
not really focusing on last fitting
right<00:01:30.780> now<00:01:30.900> obviously<00:01:31.020> I'm<00:01:31.320> just<00:01:31.439> trying<00:01:31.590> to

00:01:31.640 --> 00:01:31.650 
right now obviously I'm just trying to

00:01:31.650 --> 00:01:34.160 
right now obviously I'm just trying to
clear<00:01:31.830> these<00:01:31.950> waves<00:01:32.189> as<00:01:32.369> fast<00:01:32.580> as<00:01:32.729> possible<00:01:33.170> so

00:01:34.160 --> 00:01:34.170 
clear these waves as fast as possible so

00:01:34.170 --> 00:01:35.450 
clear these waves as fast as possible so
that<00:01:34.200> was<00:01:34.409> the<00:01:34.530> third<00:01:34.740> wave<00:01:35.009> because<00:01:35.280> I<00:01:35.340> was

00:01:35.450 --> 00:01:35.460 
that was the third wave because I was

00:01:35.460 --> 00:01:39.020 
that was the third wave because I was
the<00:01:35.580> tank<00:01:35.790> minion<00:01:37.490> that's<00:01:38.490> the<00:01:38.610> fourth<00:01:38.850> wave

00:01:39.020 --> 00:01:39.030 
the tank minion that's the fourth wave

00:01:39.030 --> 00:01:48.380 
the tank minion that's the fourth wave
coming<00:01:39.270> up<00:01:45.470> probably<00:01:46.470> due<00:01:46.619> to<00:01:46.680> two<00:01:47.250> waves<00:01:47.490> two

00:01:48.380 --> 00:01:48.390 
coming up probably due to two waves two

00:01:48.390 --> 00:01:49.760 
coming up probably due to two waves two
sets<00:01:48.600> of<00:01:48.659> tank<00:01:48.869> me<00:01:49.020> and<00:01:49.140> so<00:01:49.289> I've<00:01:49.350> got<00:01:49.500> three

00:01:49.760 --> 00:01:49.770 
sets of tank me and so I've got three

00:02:24.590 --> 00:02:24.600 
cheese is going on here so that's a

00:02:24.600 --> 00:02:26.600 
cheese is going on here so that's a
that's<00:02:25.049> the<00:02:25.200> fifth<00:02:25.440> waves<00:02:25.709> like<00:02:25.980> the<00:02:26.310> next<00:02:26.489> one

00:02:26.600 --> 00:02:26.610 
that's the fifth waves like the next one

00:02:26.610 --> 00:02:29.000 
that's the fifth waves like the next one
will<00:02:26.700> be<00:02:26.730> the<00:02:26.850> tank<00:02:27.090> and<00:02:27.269> then<00:02:27.360> all<00:02:27.540> the<00:02:28.010> canyon

00:02:29.000 --> 00:02:29.010 
will be the tank and then all the canyon

00:02:29.010 --> 00:02:31.009 
will be the tank and then all the canyon
minion<00:02:29.310> and<00:02:29.430> then<00:02:30.030> I'll<00:02:30.209> see<00:02:30.660> you<00:02:30.720> a<00:02:30.780> number

00:02:31.009 --> 00:02:31.019 
minion and then I'll see you a number

00:02:31.019 --> 00:02:34.310 
minion and then I'll see you a number
i'm<00:02:31.230> at<00:02:31.410> so<00:02:32.130> this<00:02:32.700> is<00:02:32.730> a<00:02:32.880> serious<00:02:33.780> problem<00:02:34.049> if

00:02:34.310 --> 00:02:34.320 
i'm at so this is a serious problem if

00:02:34.320 --> 00:02:35.930 
i'm at so this is a serious problem if
Ryan<00:02:34.530> does<00:02:34.680> right<00:02:34.890> to<00:02:35.040> some<00:02:35.190> fixes<00:02:35.549> I<00:02:35.640> think

00:02:35.930 --> 00:02:35.940 
Ryan does right to some fixes I think

00:02:35.940 --> 00:02:37.610 
Ryan does right to some fixes I think
for<00:02:36.120> the<00:02:36.209> world<00:02:36.420> starting<00:02:36.959> tomorrow<00:02:37.140> it

00:02:37.610 --> 00:02:37.620 
for the world starting tomorrow it

00:02:37.620 --> 00:02:40.160 
for the world starting tomorrow it
should<00:02:37.739> be<00:02:37.859> September<00:02:38.310> 15<00:02:38.810> they<00:02:39.810> play<00:02:40.019> on<00:02:40.140> the

00:02:40.160 --> 00:02:40.170 
should be September 15 they play on the

00:02:40.170 --> 00:02:41.449 
should be September 15 they play on the
tournament<00:02:40.650> realm<00:02:40.829> where<00:02:41.010> the<00:02:41.070> pool<00:02:41.220> party

00:02:41.449 --> 00:02:41.459 
tournament realm where the pool party

00:02:41.459 --> 00:02:43.580 
tournament realm where the pool party
skins<00:02:41.730> and<00:02:41.940> lucy-ann<00:02:42.239> aren't<00:02:42.570> on<00:02:42.750> yet<00:02:42.989> so<00:02:43.560> I

00:02:43.580 --> 00:02:43.590 
skins and lucy-ann aren't on yet so I

00:02:43.590 --> 00:02:45.710 
skins and lucy-ann aren't on yet so I
imagine<00:02:44.070> that<00:02:44.549> this<00:02:44.760> problem<00:02:45.239> isn't<00:02:45.359> on<00:02:45.570> there

00:02:45.710 --> 00:02:45.720 
imagine that this problem isn't on there

00:02:45.720 --> 00:02:47.539 
imagine that this problem isn't on there
now<00:02:45.840> I'm<00:02:45.900> not<00:02:46.019> sure<00:02:46.230> how<00:02:46.620> directly<00:02:47.130> correlates

00:02:47.539 --> 00:02:47.549 
now I'm not sure how directly correlates

00:02:47.549 --> 00:02:49.340 
now I'm not sure how directly correlates
to<00:02:47.670> the<00:02:47.850> fact<00:02:48.299> those<00:02:48.600> skins<00:02:48.840> came<00:02:49.019> out<00:02:49.140> on<00:02:49.230> this

00:02:49.340 --> 00:02:49.350 
to the fact those skins came out on this

00:02:49.350 --> 00:02:51.500 
to the fact those skins came out on this
patch<00:02:49.530> or<00:02:49.769> what<00:02:50.280> they<00:02:50.400> changed<00:02:50.820> as<00:02:50.940> far<00:02:50.970> as<00:02:51.209> XP

00:02:51.500 --> 00:02:51.510 
patch or what they changed as far as XP

00:02:51.510 --> 00:02:53.449 
patch or what they changed as far as XP
goes<00:02:51.690> but<00:02:52.290> it's<00:02:52.620> a<00:02:52.680> pretty<00:02:52.829> serious<00:02:53.070> problem

00:02:53.449 --> 00:02:53.459 
goes but it's a pretty serious problem

00:02:53.459 --> 00:02:54.770 
goes but it's a pretty serious problem

00:03:31.910 --> 00:03:31.920 
see how far behind I really do get so if

00:03:31.920 --> 00:03:33.890 
see how far behind I really do get so if
you<00:03:31.980> guys<00:03:32.100> remember<00:03:32.480> obviously<00:03:33.480> you<00:03:33.569> just<00:03:33.750> did

00:03:34.640 --> 00:03:34.650 
because it would have been like 10

00:03:34.650 --> 00:03:37.339 
because it would have been like 10

00:03:46.030 --> 00:03:46.040 
six waves so we'll see how I get there

00:03:46.040 --> 00:03:59.949 
six waves so we'll see how I get there

I<00:04:22.840> don't<00:04:23.470> really<00:04:23.560> know<00:04:23.850> it's<00:04:24.850> really<00:04:25.270> annoying

00:04:25.650 --> 00:04:25.660 
I don't really know it's really annoying

research<00:04:30.790> is<00:04:31.000> there<00:04:31.300> was<00:04:31.390> a<00:04:31.420> forum<00:04:31.900> post<00:04:31.930> about

00:04:32.310 --> 00:04:32.320 
research is there was a forum post about

00:04:32.320 --> 00:04:34.620 
research is there was a forum post about
it<00:04:32.470> and<00:04:33.340> it's<00:04:33.490> still<00:04:33.850> not<00:04:34.000> like<00:04:34.060> basically<00:04:34.510> the

00:04:34.620 --> 00:04:34.630 
it and it's still not like basically the

00:04:34.630 --> 00:04:37.020 
it and it's still not like basically the
windbreak<00:04:35.200> before<00:04:35.680> was<00:04:35.980> a<00:04:36.010> 51-percent<00:04:36.640> chance

00:04:37.020 --> 00:04:37.030 
windbreak before was a 51-percent chance

00:04:37.030 --> 00:04:39.090 
windbreak before was a 51-percent chance
of<00:04:37.210> blue<00:04:37.330> side<00:04:37.690> and<00:04:37.960> a<00:04:38.020> 49-percent<00:04:38.530> chance<00:04:38.860> to

00:04:39.090 --> 00:04:39.100 
of blue side and a 49-percent chance to

00:04:39.100 --> 00:04:42.000 
of blue side and a 49-percent chance to
purple<00:04:39.700> side<00:04:39.820> now<00:04:40.780> it's<00:04:41.230> like<00:04:41.350> a<00:04:41.500> sixty

00:04:42.000 --> 00:04:42.010 
purple side now it's like a sixty

00:04:42.010 --> 00:04:43.620 
purple side now it's like a sixty
percent<00:04:42.160> chance<00:04:42.550> for<00:04:42.790> blue<00:04:42.970> side<00:04:43.210> and<00:04:43.480> like<00:04:43.600> a

00:04:43.620 --> 00:04:43.630 
percent chance for blue side and like a

00:04:43.630 --> 00:04:45.150 
percent chance for blue side and like a
forty<00:04:44.020> percent<00:04:44.230> chance<00:04:44.410> for<00:04:44.680> purples<00:04:44.920> I<00:04:45.010> which

00:04:45.150 --> 00:04:45.160 
forty percent chance for purples I which

00:04:45.160 --> 00:04:47.100 
forty percent chance for purples I which
is<00:04:45.280> pretty<00:04:45.460> pretty<00:04:45.910> massive<00:04:46.270> like<00:04:46.600> you're<00:04:46.750> at

00:04:47.100 --> 00:04:47.110 
is pretty pretty massive like you're at

00:04:47.110 --> 00:04:49.530 
is pretty pretty massive like you're at
a<00:04:47.170> pretty<00:04:47.890> good<00:04:48.130> disadvantage<00:04:48.730> like<00:04:49.240> I<00:04:49.390> mean

00:04:49.530 --> 00:04:49.540 
a pretty good disadvantage like I mean

00:04:49.540 --> 00:04:51.660 
a pretty good disadvantage like I mean
for<00:04:49.750> instance<00:04:49.780> you<00:04:50.740> know<00:04:50.770> roulette<00:04:51.280> tables

00:04:51.660 --> 00:04:51.670 
for instance you know roulette tables

00:04:51.670 --> 00:04:53.790 
for instance you know roulette tables
based<00:04:52.090> on<00:04:52.420> them<00:04:52.780> on<00:04:53.020> that<00:04:53.200> low<00:04:53.530> of<00:04:53.560> a

00:04:53.790 --> 00:04:53.800 
based on them on that low of a

00:04:53.800 --> 00:04:55.500 
based on them on that low of a
percentage<00:04:54.190> of<00:04:54.340> win<00:04:54.550> rate<00:04:54.730> because<00:04:55.330> the

00:04:55.500 --> 00:04:55.510 
percentage of win rate because the

00:04:55.510 --> 00:04:57.060 
percentage of win rate because the
casinos<00:04:55.990> will<00:04:56.200> know<00:04:56.470> they'll<00:04:56.680> still<00:04:56.890> going<00:04:57.010> to

00:04:57.060 --> 00:04:57.070 
casinos will know they'll still going to

00:04:57.070 --> 00:04:59.220 
casinos will know they'll still going to
win<00:04:57.330> more<00:04:58.330> than<00:04:58.360> they're<00:04:58.690> going<00:04:58.810> to<00:04:58.870> lose<00:04:58.990> off

00:04:59.220 --> 00:04:59.230 
win more than they're going to lose off

00:04:59.230 --> 00:05:02.790 
win more than they're going to lose off
that<00:05:00.660> so<00:05:01.660> it's<00:05:01.870> pretty<00:05:02.080> huge<00:05:02.410> that<00:05:02.650> that's

00:05:02.790 --> 00:05:02.800 
that so it's pretty huge that that's

00:05:02.800 --> 00:05:04.860 
that so it's pretty huge that that's
that's<00:05:03.340> how<00:05:03.520> it's<00:05:03.700> gotten<00:05:04.000> so<00:05:04.150> far<00:05:04.360> but<00:05:04.570> which

00:05:04.860 --> 00:05:04.870 
that's how it's gotten so far but which

00:05:04.870 --> 00:05:21.360 
that's how it's gotten so far but which
way<00:05:05.110> is<00:05:05.140> this<00:05:05.530> this<00:05:06.220> is<00:05:06.370> five<00:05:06.640> I<00:05:06.669> guess

00:05:21.360 --> 00:05:21.370 

00:05:21.370 --> 00:05:23.409 

next<00:05:22.370> wave<00:05:22.490> coming<00:05:22.729> out<00:05:22.850> should<00:05:23.000> be<00:05:23.030> the<00:05:23.180> tank

00:05:23.409 --> 00:05:23.419 
next wave coming out should be the tank

00:05:23.419 --> 00:05:26.680 
next wave coming out should be the tank
okay<00:05:24.139> so<00:05:24.199> this<00:05:24.410> is<00:05:24.560> going<00:05:24.680> to<00:05:24.770> be<00:05:25.419> as<00:05:26.419> you<00:05:26.600> can

00:05:26.680 --> 00:05:26.690 
okay so this is going to be as you can

00:05:26.690 --> 00:05:28.800 
okay so this is going to be as you can
see<00:05:26.810> I'm<00:05:26.930> not<00:05:27.050> even<00:05:27.259> close<00:05:27.410> to<00:05:27.470> level<00:05:27.800> five<00:05:27.979> yet

00:05:28.800 --> 00:05:28.810 
see I'm not even close to level five yet

00:05:28.810 --> 00:05:32.140 
see I'm not even close to level five yet
only<00:05:29.810> half<00:05:30.050> not<00:05:30.349> even<00:05:30.500> halfway<00:05:30.849> this<00:05:31.849> is<00:05:32.030> the

00:05:32.140 --> 00:05:32.150 
only half not even halfway this is the

00:05:32.150 --> 00:05:35.860 
only half not even halfway this is the
same<00:05:32.360> amount<00:05:32.479> of<00:05:32.660> minions<00:05:32.960> as<00:05:33.110> last<00:05:33.319> time<00:05:34.870> and

00:05:35.860 --> 00:05:35.870 
same amount of minions as last time and

00:05:35.870 --> 00:05:37.180 
same amount of minions as last time and
you<00:05:35.990> don't<00:05:36.110> for<00:05:36.530> those<00:05:36.650> of<00:05:36.740> you<00:05:36.800> again<00:05:37.069> that's

00:05:37.180 --> 00:05:37.190 
you don't for those of you again that's

00:05:37.190 --> 00:05:38.710 
you don't for those of you again that's
going<00:05:37.430> to<00:05:37.490> see<00:05:37.610> questions<00:05:38.150> like<00:05:38.330> last<00:05:38.509> hitting

00:05:38.710 --> 00:05:38.720 
going to see questions like last hitting

00:05:38.720 --> 00:05:40.779 
going to see questions like last hitting
not<00:05:39.289> consciously<00:05:39.889> paying<00:05:40.310> attention<00:05:40.669> the

00:05:40.779 --> 00:05:40.789 
not consciously paying attention the

00:05:40.789 --> 00:05:43.749 
not consciously paying attention the
last<00:05:40.940> hitting<00:05:41.150> that<00:05:41.270> much<00:05:41.530> because<00:05:42.530> it's<00:05:43.400> you

00:05:43.749 --> 00:05:43.759
