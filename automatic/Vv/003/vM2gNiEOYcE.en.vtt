guys want to see now I was thinking

00:02:18.610 --> 00:02:20.880 
guys want to see now I was thinking
maybe<00:02:18.760> of<00:02:19.120> the<00:02:19.840> trade<00:02:20.110> in<00:02:20.290> series<00:02:20.680> however

00:02:20.880 --> 00:02:20.890 
maybe of the trade in series however

00:02:20.890 --> 00:02:24.840 
maybe of the trade in series however
unique<00:02:21.550> kind<00:02:22.180> of<00:02:22.240> a<00:02:23.040> way<00:02:24.040> I<00:02:24.070> know<00:02:24.250> how<00:02:24.400> to<00:02:24.520> trade

00:02:24.840 --> 00:02:24.850

00:02:31.290 --> 00:02:31.300 
moment exam is by trading within forms

00:02:31.300 --> 00:02:32.820 
moment exam is by trading within forms
because<00:02:31.510> their<00:02:31.780> prices<00:02:32.200> don't<00:02:32.380> really<00:02:32.620> drop

00:02:32.820 --> 00:02:32.830 
because their prices don't really drop

because their prices don't really drop
load<00:02:33.070> 10k<00:02:33.610> obviously<00:02:34.510> because<00:02:34.660> that's<00:02:34.990> kind

00:02:35.220 --> 00:02:35.230 
load 10k obviously because that's kind

00:02:35.230 --> 00:02:38.040 
load 10k obviously because that's kind
of<00:02:35.350> around<00:02:35.650> that<00:02:35.800> discard<00:02:36.220> price<00:02:36.430> so<00:02:37.050> that's

00:02:38.040 --> 00:02:38.050 
of around that discard price so that's

00:02:38.050 --> 00:02:39.510 
of around that discard price so that's
really<00:02:38.260> the<00:02:38.770> only<00:02:38.800> way<00:02:39.070> i'll<00:02:39.220> be<00:02:39.250> able<00:02:39.340> to

00:02:39.510 --> 00:02:39.520 
really the only way i'll be able to

00:02:39.520 --> 00:02:41.010 
really the only way i'll be able to
trade<00:02:39.790> so<00:02:40.120> i<00:02:40.150> don't<00:02:40.510> know<00:02:40.570> if<00:02:40.630> you<00:02:40.690> want<00:02:40.810> to<00:02:40.870> see

could call it career you'll see a couple
of<00:03:33.280> times<00:03:33.459> in<00:03:33.519> this<00:03:33.610> video<00:03:33.880> I<00:03:33.940> kind<00:03:34.180> of<00:03:34.320> I<00:03:35.320> kind

00:03:35.910 --> 00:03:35.920 
of times in this video I kind of I kind

00:03:35.920 --> 00:03:37.590 
of times in this video I kind of I kind
of<00:03:36.010> noticed<00:03:36.310> that<00:03:36.610> this<00:03:36.730> guy<00:03:37.000> is<00:03:37.030> quite<00:03:37.570> easy

00:03:37.590 --> 00:03:37.600 
of noticed that this guy is quite easy

00:03:37.600 --> 00:03:39.540 
of noticed that this guy is quite easy
to<00:03:37.930> break<00:03:38.110> down<00:03:38.350> and<00:03:38.620> that<00:03:39.010> is<00:03:39.220> not<00:03:39.400> going<00:03:39.489> to

00:03:39.540 --> 00:03:39.550 
to break down and that is not going to

00:03:39.550 --> 00:03:44.310 
to break down and that is not going to
be<00:03:39.670> too<00:03:39.820> much<00:03:39.910> of<00:03:39.970> a<00:03:40.150> threat<00:03:40.650> so<00:03:41.650> I<00:03:42.100> try<00:03:42.610> and<00:03:43.320> you

00:03:44.310 --> 00:03:44.320 
be too much of a threat so I try and you

00:03:44.320 --> 00:03:45.600 
be too much of a threat so I try and you
see<00:03:44.590> me<00:03:44.739> waste<00:03:45.010> a<00:03:45.130> couple<00:03:45.340> of<00:03:45.400> opportunities

00:03:45.600 --> 00:03:45.610 
see me waste a couple of opportunities

00:03:45.610 --> 00:03:48.060 
see me waste a couple of opportunities
errs<00:03:46.120> I<00:03:46.299> try<00:03:46.989> and<00:03:47.049> take<00:03:47.200> the<00:03:47.320> ball<00:03:47.470> too<00:03:47.650> far<00:03:47.890> and

00:03:50.110 --> 00:03:52.050 
try and do too many skills now that's
the<00:03:50.410> reason<00:03:50.830> that<00:03:50.860> I<00:03:50.980> don't<00:03:51.220> obscure<00:03:51.489> teams<00:03:51.730> in

00:03:52.050 --> 00:03:52.060 
the reason that I don't obscure teams in

00:03:52.060 --> 00:03:55.259 
the reason that I don't obscure teams in
FIFA<00:03:52.330> 12<00:03:53.260> is<00:03:53.680> that<00:03:53.980> I<00:03:54.519> have<00:03:54.790> had<00:03:54.940> them<00:03:55.090> in<00:03:55.180> the

00:03:55.259 --> 00:03:55.269 
FIFA 12 is that I have had them in the

00:03:55.269 --> 00:03:58.229 
FIFA 12 is that I have had them in the
past<00:03:55.450> and<00:03:55.860> it's<00:03:56.860> made<00:03:57.220> me<00:03:57.250> lose<00:03:57.640> like<00:03:57.940> nearly

00:03:58.229 --> 00:03:58.239 
past and it's made me lose like nearly

00:03:58.239 --> 00:03:59.699 
past and it's made me lose like nearly
you<00:03:58.420> know<00:03:58.540> next<00:03:58.780> to<00:03:58.959> nothing<00:03:58.989> of<00:03:59.320> every<00:03:59.560> single

00:03:59.699 --> 00:03:59.709 
you know next to nothing of every single

was like a 50k drop in price in the

00:05:03.810 --> 00:05:06.920 
was like a 50k drop in price in the
space<00:05:04.050> of<00:05:04.080> a<00:05:04.410> day<00:05:04.440> maybe<00:05:04.980> two<00:05:05.130> days<00:05:05.720> it's<00:05:06.720> going

00:05:06.920 --> 00:05:06.930 
space of a day maybe two days it's going

00:05:06.930 --> 00:05:08.630 
space of a day maybe two days it's going
to<00:05:06.960> get<00:05:07.110> even<00:05:07.170> worse<00:05:07.530> now<00:05:07.890> the<00:05:07.950> market<00:05:08.400> is<00:05:08.490> not

00:05:08.630 --> 00:05:08.640 
to get even worse now the market is not

00:05:08.640 --> 00:05:10.130 
to get even worse now the market is not
in<00:05:08.790> a<00:05:08.850> very<00:05:08.970> good<00:05:09.090> state<00:05:09.450> at<00:05:09.600> the<00:05:09.630> moment<00:05:09.720> as<00:05:10.020> it

00:05:10.130 --> 00:05:10.140 
in a very good state at the moment as it

00:05:10.140 --> 00:05:12.440 
in a very good state at the moment as it
is<00:05:10.260> but<00:05:11.010> I<00:05:11.070> think<00:05:11.460> that<00:05:11.610> it's<00:05:11.760> going<00:05:12.000> to<00:05:12.090> be<00:05:12.180> so

00:05:12.440 --> 00:05:12.450 
is but I think that it's going to be so

00:05:12.450 --> 00:05:14.120 
is but I think that it's going to be so
bad<00:05:12.750> and<00:05:12.960> so<00:05:13.020> hard<00:05:13.380> to<00:05:13.470> trade<00:05:13.710> which<00:05:13.890> is<00:05:14.010> what

00:05:14.120 --> 00:05:14.130 
bad and so hard to trade which is what

00:05:14.130 --> 00:05:17.330 
bad and so hard to trade which is what
