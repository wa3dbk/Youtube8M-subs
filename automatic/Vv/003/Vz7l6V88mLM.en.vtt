it's a bladder tight pressure tank and

00:01:13.690 --> 00:01:16.830 
it's a bladder tight pressure tank and
that's<00:01:14.410> just<00:01:14.740> used<00:01:15.039> to<00:01:15.250> provide<00:01:15.520> some<00:01:15.970> cushion

00:01:16.830 --> 00:01:16.840 
that's just used to provide some cushion

00:01:16.840 --> 00:01:19.260 
that's just used to provide some cushion
and<00:01:16.990> some<00:01:17.229> feedback<00:01:17.830> for<00:01:18.640> the<00:01:18.910> pressure

00:01:19.260 --> 00:01:19.270 
and some feedback for the pressure

00:01:19.270 --> 00:01:23.490 
and some feedback for the pressure
sensor<00:01:19.930> which<00:01:20.170> actually<00:01:20.649> controls<00:01:21.210> the<00:01:22.500> the

00:01:28.440 --> 00:01:28.450 
to be able to control the pump the

00:01:28.450 --> 00:01:31.890 
to be able to control the pump the
pressure<00:01:28.720> tank<00:01:29.020> is<00:01:29.260> not<00:01:29.530> a<00:01:29.950> storage<00:01:30.820> tank<00:01:31.150> like

00:01:31.890 --> 00:01:31.900 
pressure tank is not a storage tank like

00:01:31.900 --> 00:01:34.530 
pressure tank is not a storage tank like
we<00:01:32.140> typically<00:01:32.650> think<00:01:33.070> of<00:01:33.880> pressure<00:01:34.119> tanks

00:01:34.530 --> 00:01:34.540 
we typically think of pressure tanks

00:01:34.540 --> 00:01:36.480 
we typically think of pressure tanks
being<00:01:34.780> the<00:01:35.259> pump<00:01:35.470> doesn't<00:01:35.710> pump<00:01:36.159> water<00:01:36.369> into

00:01:36.480 --> 00:01:36.490 
being the pump doesn't pump water into

00:01:36.490 --> 00:01:37.950 
being the pump doesn't pump water into
the<00:01:36.759> pressure<00:01:36.970> tank<00:01:37.210> and<00:01:37.450> then<00:01:37.540> shut<00:01:37.780> off

00:01:37.950 --> 00:01:37.960 
the pressure tank and then shut off

00:01:37.960 --> 00:01:40.890 
the pressure tank and then shut off
water<00:01:38.530> flows<00:01:38.860> out<00:01:39.100> it's<00:01:39.729> simply<00:01:40.270> there<00:01:40.509> to

00:01:40.890 --> 00:01:40.900 
water flows out it's simply there to

00:01:40.900 --> 00:01:44.340 
water flows out it's simply there to
provide<00:01:41.590> some<00:01:41.950> cushion<00:01:42.400> for<00:01:43.240> the<00:01:43.350> pressure

00:01:44.340 --> 00:01:44.350 
provide some cushion for the pressure

00:01:44.350 --> 00:01:47.429 
provide some cushion for the pressure
sensor<00:01:44.860> and<00:01:45.100> just<00:01:45.909> a<00:01:46.119> little<00:01:46.329> bit<00:01:46.570> of<00:01:46.750> feedback

00:01:47.429 --> 00:01:47.439 
sensor and just a little bit of feedback

00:01:47.439 --> 00:01:51.120 
sensor and just a little bit of feedback
for<00:01:48.369> the<00:01:48.460> pressure<00:01:48.670> sensor<00:01:49.119> so<00:01:49.720> it<00:01:50.409> allows<00:01:50.740> the

00:01:51.120 --> 00:01:51.130 
for the pressure sensor so it allows the

00:01:51.130 --> 00:01:53.520 
for the pressure sensor so it allows the
pump<00:01:51.369> to<00:01:51.700> maintain<00:01:52.540> pressure<00:01:52.900> instead<00:01:53.439> of

00:01:53.520 --> 00:01:53.530 
pump to maintain pressure instead of

00:01:53.530 --> 00:01:59.429 
pump to maintain pressure instead of
having<00:01:53.740> a<00:01:53.979> large<00:01:54.759> off<00:01:55.380> on<00:01:56.970> cycle<00:01:57.970> of<00:01:58.210> the<00:01:59.170> pump

00:01:59.429 --> 00:01:59.439 
having a large off on cycle of the pump

00:01:59.439 --> 00:02:03.420

and<00:01:59.680> water<00:02:00.610> pressure<00:02:00.909> in<00:02:01.299> the<00:02:01.509> system<00:02:02.430> we're

00:02:03.420 --> 00:02:03.430 
and water pressure in the system we're

00:02:03.430 --> 00:02:05.910 
and water pressure in the system we're
looking<00:02:03.670> at<00:02:03.790> the<00:02:04.030> pressure<00:02:04.750> sensor<00:02:05.290> and<00:02:05.649> the

00:02:05.910 --> 00:02:05.920 
looking at the pressure sensor and the

00:02:05.920 --> 00:02:08.699 
looking at the pressure sensor and the

pressure gage the pressure gage just

00:02:08.709 --> 00:02:10.889 
pressure gage the pressure gage just
allows<00:02:09.009> us<00:02:09.040> to<00:02:09.429> visually<00:02:09.880> confirm<00:02:10.329> that<00:02:10.660> the

00:02:10.889 --> 00:02:10.899 
allows us to visually confirm that the

00:02:10.899 --> 00:02:13.890 
allows us to visually confirm that the
that<00:02:11.620> the<00:02:11.799> pump<00:02:12.040> is<00:02:12.220> maintaining<00:02:12.970> pressure<00:02:13.209> at

00:02:13.890 --> 00:02:13.900 
that the pump is maintaining pressure at

00:02:13.900 --> 00:02:16.890 
that the pump is maintaining pressure at
the<00:02:14.410> value<00:02:15.160> that<00:02:15.190> we've<00:02:15.549> set<00:02:15.910> at<00:02:16.450> any<00:02:16.600> given

00:02:16.890 --> 00:02:16.900 
the value that we've set at any given

00:02:16.900 --> 00:02:19.470 
the value that we've set at any given
point<00:02:17.170> in<00:02:17.350> time<00:02:17.560> and<00:02:17.980> the<00:02:18.730> pressure<00:02:18.970> sensor<00:02:19.450> is

00:02:19.470 --> 00:02:19.480 
point in time and the pressure sensor is

00:02:19.480 --> 00:02:21.780 
point in time and the pressure sensor is
what<00:02:19.900> provides<00:02:20.320> feedback<00:02:20.769> to<00:02:21.280> the<00:02:21.400> variable

00:02:21.780 --> 00:02:21.790 
what provides feedback to the variable

00:02:21.790 --> 00:02:24.860 
what provides feedback to the variable
frequency<00:02:22.000> drive<00:02:22.540> for<00:02:22.959> controlling<00:02:23.590> the<00:02:23.829> pump

what<00:02:25.870> we're<00:02:26.020> looking<00:02:26.260> at<00:02:26.379> right<00:02:26.530> now<00:02:26.739> is<00:02:26.980> is

00:02:27.270 --> 00:02:27.280 
what we're looking at right now is is

00:02:27.280 --> 00:02:29.820 
what we're looking at right now is is
simply<00:02:27.970> a<00:02:28.000> water<00:02:28.360> meter<00:02:28.629> and<00:02:29.050> that<00:02:29.319> allows<00:02:29.800> us

00:02:29.820 --> 00:02:29.830 
simply a water meter and that allows us

00:02:29.830 --> 00:02:30.870 
simply a water meter and that allows us
to<00:02:30.099> track

00:02:30.870 --> 00:02:30.880 
to track

00:02:30.880 --> 00:02:33.500 
to track
how<00:02:30.970> much<00:02:31.180> water<00:02:31.420> we<00:02:31.810> pump<00:02:32.110> at<00:02:32.500> any<00:02:32.860> given<00:02:33.130> time

00:02:33.500 --> 00:02:33.510 
how much water we pump at any given time

00:02:33.510 --> 00:02:36.210 
how much water we pump at any given time
or<00:02:34.510> throughout<00:02:34.810> the<00:02:35.200> season<00:02:35.740> or<00:02:35.890> throughout

00:02:36.210 --> 00:02:36.220 
or throughout the season or throughout

00:02:36.220 --> 00:02:38.220 
or throughout the season or throughout
the<00:02:36.400> year<00:02:36.730> it's<00:02:37.030> a<00:02:37.180> simple<00:02:37.540> meter<00:02:37.720> with<00:02:37.990> a

00:02:38.220 --> 00:02:38.230 
the year it's a simple meter with a

00:02:38.230 --> 00:02:41.040 
the year it's a simple meter with a
gallon<00:02:38.680> figure<00:02:39.580> on<00:02:39.790> it<00:02:39.820> and<00:02:40.270> lets<00:02:40.660> us<00:02:40.810> track

00:02:41.040 --> 00:02:41.050 
gallon figure on it and lets us track

00:02:41.050 --> 00:02:44.040 
gallon figure on it and lets us track
water<00:02:41.320> usage<00:02:41.910> so<00:02:42.910> if<00:02:43.030> you<00:02:43.120> look<00:02:43.300> at<00:02:43.390> the<00:02:43.600> well

00:02:44.040 --> 00:02:44.050 
water usage so if you look at the well

00:02:44.050 --> 00:02:46.530 
water usage so if you look at the well
casing<00:02:44.320> coming<00:02:44.800> out<00:02:44.920> of<00:02:45.010> the<00:02:45.100> ground<00:02:45.280> the<00:02:46.000> the

00:02:48.570 --> 00:02:48.580 
path that the stream of water will flow

00:02:48.580 --> 00:02:50.820 
path that the stream of water will flow
is<00:02:48.970> right<00:02:49.210> straight<00:02:49.510> up<00:02:49.540> through<00:02:50.140> the<00:02:50.380> drop

00:02:50.820 --> 00:02:50.830 
is right straight up through the drop

00:02:50.830 --> 00:02:53.010 
is right straight up through the drop
pipe<00:02:51.040> that's<00:02:51.310> inside<00:02:51.730> the<00:02:51.910> casing<00:02:52.150> up<00:02:52.630> into

90-degree turn flows into the blue pipe

00:02:58.090 --> 00:03:02.400 
90-degree turn flows into the blue pipe
then<00:02:58.870> flows<00:02:59.230> through<00:02:59.260> the<00:02:59.970> water<00:03:00.970> meter<00:03:01.410> then

00:03:02.400 --> 00:03:02.410 
then flows through the water meter then

00:03:02.410 --> 00:03:06.390 
then flows through the water meter then
into<00:03:02.770> the<00:03:02.920> PVC<00:03:03.160> pipe<00:03:03.880> and<00:03:05.010> through<00:03:06.010> the<00:03:06.130> black

underneath everything that leads over to
the<00:03:24.610> pressure<00:03:24.850> tank<00:03:25.150> is<00:03:25.750> simply<00:03:26.320> a<00:03:26.680> place<00:03:27.100> for

00:03:27.510 --> 00:03:27.520 
the pressure tank is simply a place for

00:03:27.520 --> 00:03:30.780 
the pressure tank is simply a place for
us<00:03:27.580> to<00:03:27.880> feed<00:03:28.690> water<00:03:29.050> in<00:03:29.380> to<00:03:30.040> get<00:03:30.250> it<00:03:30.370> to<00:03:30.550> the

00:03:30.780 --> 00:03:30.790 
us to feed water in to get it to the

00:03:30.790 --> 00:03:32.610 
us to feed water in to get it to the
pressure<00:03:31.120> sensor<00:03:31.750> and<00:03:31.780> the<00:03:32.020> pressure<00:03:32.290> gauge

00:03:32.610 --> 00:03:32.620 
pressure sensor and the pressure gauge

00:03:32.620 --> 00:03:35.550 
pressure sensor and the pressure gauge
so<00:03:33.070> that<00:03:33.250> the<00:03:33.430> VFD<00:03:33.910> will<00:03:34.570> have<00:03:34.750> a<00:03:34.780> have<00:03:35.170> a<00:03:35.200> place

00:03:35.550 --> 00:03:35.560 
so that the VFD will have a have a place

00:03:35.560 --> 00:03:38.190 
so that the VFD will have a have a place
to<00:03:35.920> read<00:03:36.190> pressure<00:03:36.880> and<00:03:37.300> be<00:03:37.570> able<00:03:37.720> to<00:03:37.810> control

anywhere on the farm we need with the
other<00:04:37.960> pumps<00:04:38.640> what<00:04:39.640> we're<00:04:39.790> looking<00:04:40.030> at<00:04:40.150> is<00:04:40.330> a

00:04:40.350 --> 00:04:40.360 
other pumps what we're looking at is a

00:04:40.360 --> 00:04:42.930 
other pumps what we're looking at is a
six<00:04:40.780> inch<00:04:40.960> riser<00:04:41.229> coming<00:04:41.830> up<00:04:41.979> from<00:04:42.160> our<00:04:42.370> main

00:04:42.930 --> 00:04:42.940 
six inch riser coming up from our main

00:04:42.940 --> 00:04:44.490 
six inch riser coming up from our main
irrigation<00:04:43.720> line

00:04:44.490 --> 00:04:44.500 
irrigation line

00:04:44.500 --> 00:04:47.160 
irrigation line
there's<00:04:44.980> a<00:04:45.070> piece<00:04:45.970> of<00:04:46.150> 6-inch<00:04:46.540> pipe<00:04:46.810> that

00:04:47.160 --> 00:04:47.170 
there's a piece of 6-inch pipe that

00:04:47.170 --> 00:04:49.850 
there's a piece of 6-inch pipe that
comes<00:04:47.380> up<00:04:47.650> from<00:04:47.860> that<00:04:48.010> line<00:04:48.250> above<00:04:49.060> ground<00:04:49.450> and

00:04:49.850 --> 00:04:49.860 
comes up from that line above ground and

00:04:49.860 --> 00:04:53.490 
comes up from that line above ground and
on<00:04:50.860> top<00:04:51.220> of<00:04:51.250> it<00:04:51.520> we've<00:04:51.640> got<00:04:51.850> a<00:04:51.880> six<00:04:52.270> inch<00:04:52.540> ball

00:04:53.490 --> 00:04:53.500 
on top of it we've got a six inch ball

00:04:53.500 --> 00:04:57.980 
on top of it we've got a six inch ball
valve<00:04:53.950> and<00:04:54.720> this<00:04:55.720> riser<00:04:56.400> was<00:04:57.400> put<00:04:57.670> in

00:04:57.980 --> 00:04:57.990 
valve and this riser was put in

00:04:57.990 --> 00:05:01.590 
valve and this riser was put in
basically<00:04:58.990> for<00:04:59.710> future<00:05:00.040> expansion<00:05:00.700> it's<00:05:01.360> much

00:05:01.590 --> 00:05:01.600 
basically for future expansion it's much

00:05:01.600 --> 00:05:04.650 
basically for future expansion it's much
easier<00:05:02.020> to<00:05:02.080> put<00:05:02.550> risers<00:05:03.550> in<00:05:03.580> when<00:05:04.510> you're

00:05:04.650 --> 00:05:04.660 
easier to put risers in when you're

00:05:04.660 --> 00:05:06.840 
easier to put risers in when you're
building<00:05:04.900> a<00:05:05.140> line<00:05:05.320> than<00:05:05.620> it<00:05:05.650> is<00:05:05.950> to<00:05:06.280> have<00:05:06.610> to<00:05:06.640> go

00:05:06.840 --> 00:05:06.850 
building a line than it is to have to go

00:05:06.850 --> 00:05:09.480 
building a line than it is to have to go
back<00:05:07.030> and<00:05:07.300> tear<00:05:07.810> the<00:05:07.930> line<00:05:08.110> up<00:05:08.350> and<00:05:08.620> insert<00:05:09.430> a

00:05:09.480 --> 00:05:09.490 
back and tear the line up and insert a

00:05:09.490 --> 00:05:12.090 
back and tear the line up and insert a
riser<00:05:09.820> into<00:05:10.180> it<00:05:10.510> so<00:05:10.810> at<00:05:11.320> this<00:05:11.560> point<00:05:11.800> in<00:05:11.950> time

00:05:12.090 --> 00:05:12.100 
riser into it so at this point in time

00:05:12.100 --> 00:05:13.920 
riser into it so at this point in time
we're<00:05:12.310> not<00:05:12.340> using<00:05:12.850> this<00:05:12.970> riser<00:05:13.240> for<00:05:13.540> anything

00:05:13.920 --> 00:05:13.930 
we're not using this riser for anything

00:05:13.930 --> 00:05:16.350 
we're not using this riser for anything
but<00:05:14.110> it<00:05:14.230> it's<00:05:14.830> another<00:05:15.190> access<00:05:15.820> point<00:05:16.120> for

00:05:16.350 --> 00:05:16.360 
but it it's another access point for

00:05:16.360 --> 00:05:20.630 
but it it's another access point for
irrigation<00:05:16.900> water<00:05:17.080> for<00:05:17.410> future<00:05:18.310> projects

00:05:20.630 --> 00:05:20.640 
irrigation water for future projects
