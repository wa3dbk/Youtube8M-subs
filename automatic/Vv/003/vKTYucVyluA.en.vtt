00:00:23.359 --> 00:00:23.369 
and hyper beam by epic I chose these two

00:00:23.369 --> 00:00:24.980 
and hyper beam by epic I chose these two
tracks<00:00:23.580> because<00:00:23.789> they<00:00:24.180> sound<00:00:24.420> somewhat<00:00:24.750> alike

00:00:24.980 --> 00:00:24.990 
tracks because they sound somewhat alike

00:00:24.990 --> 00:00:29.240

iPhone<00:00:41.040> bust<00:00:41.219> uh<00:00:42.170> you<00:00:43.170> don't<00:00:43.350> even<00:00:43.469> exactly

00:00:43.700 --> 00:00:43.710 
iPhone bust uh you don't even exactly

00:00:43.710 --> 00:00:47.209 
iPhone bust uh you don't even exactly
like<00:00:44.420> you<00:00:45.420> can<00:00:45.600> speed<00:00:45.930> them<00:00:46.050> up<00:00:46.140> whatever<00:00:46.469> but

like you can speed them up whatever but

00:00:47.219 --> 00:00:48.500 
like you can speed them up whatever but
make<00:00:47.370> sure<00:00:47.399> that<00:00:47.700> you<00:00:47.879> don't<00:00:47.940> speed<00:00:48.180> up<00:00:48.270> too
