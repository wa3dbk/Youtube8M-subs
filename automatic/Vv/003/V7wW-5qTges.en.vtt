it didn't hurt and it's also very

00:02:00.790 --> 00:02:02.760 
it didn't hurt and it's also very
important<00:02:01.390> when<00:02:01.960> you<00:02:02.080> change<00:02:02.350> your<00:02:02.530> tongue

00:02:17.640 --> 00:02:17.650 
quick I did end up keeping the long one

00:02:17.650 --> 00:02:19.380 
quick I did end up keeping the long one
just<00:02:17.950> in<00:02:18.100> case<00:02:18.340> if<00:02:18.640> anything<00:02:19.090> were<00:02:19.180> to<00:02:19.240> happen

00:02:19.380 --> 00:02:19.390 
just in case if anything were to happen

00:02:19.390 --> 00:02:21.240 
just in case if anything were to happen
in<00:02:19.720> my<00:02:19.810> tongue<00:02:20.020> were<00:02:20.170> to<00:02:20.290> swell<00:02:20.650> up<00:02:20.860> for<00:02:21.070> some

00:02:21.240 --> 00:02:21.250 
in my tongue were to swell up for some

00:02:21.250 --> 00:02:23.930 
in my tongue were to swell up for some
reason<00:02:21.580> I<00:02:21.670> have<00:02:21.880> the<00:02:22.090> long<00:02:22.270> one<00:02:22.480> to<00:02:22.570> put<00:02:22.750> in<00:02:22.900> but

00:02:23.930 --> 00:02:23.940 
reason I have the long one to put in but

00:02:23.940 --> 00:02:27.450 
reason I have the long one to put in but
it<00:02:24.940> feels<00:02:25.360> so<00:02:25.660> much<00:02:25.840> better<00:02:26.110> than<00:02:26.920> the<00:02:27.130> longer

00:02:27.450 --> 00:02:27.460 
it feels so much better than the longer

00:02:27.460 --> 00:02:28.920 
it feels so much better than the longer
one<00:02:27.640> cuz<00:02:27.790> when<00:02:27.880> I<00:02:27.910> had<00:02:28.060> the<00:02:28.180> longer<00:02:28.510> one<00:02:28.660> every

00:02:28.920 --> 00:02:28.930 
one cuz when I had the longer one every

00:02:28.930 --> 00:02:31.380 
one cuz when I had the longer one every
time<00:02:29.110> I'd<00:02:29.230> eat<00:02:29.440> I'd<00:02:29.620> bite<00:02:29.890> down<00:02:30.100> on<00:02:30.160> it<00:02:30.400> and<00:02:30.760> it

00:02:31.380 --> 00:02:31.390 
time I'd eat I'd bite down on it and it

00:02:31.390 --> 00:02:34.770 
time I'd eat I'd bite down on it and it
would<00:02:31.510> really<00:02:31.780> really<00:02:31.990> hurt<00:02:32.410> and<00:02:32.890> I<00:02:33.850> a<00:02:34.180> couple

00:02:34.770 --> 00:02:34.780 
would really really hurt and I a couple

00:02:34.780 --> 00:02:36.090 
would really really hurt and I a couple
times<00:02:34.990> I<00:02:35.110> thought<00:02:35.290> I<00:02:35.320> actually<00:02:35.560> chipped<00:02:35.980> a

00:02:36.090 --> 00:02:36.100 
times I thought I actually chipped a

00:02:36.100 --> 00:02:39.480 
times I thought I actually chipped a

00:03:35.220 --> 00:03:39.830 

so<00:03:35.730> hopefully<00:03:36.060> you<00:03:36.150> can<00:03:36.210> see<00:03:36.360> that<00:03:36.540> is<00:03:38.750> 5/16<00:03:39.750> of

00:03:39.830 --> 00:03:39.840 
so hopefully you can see that is 5/16 of

00:03:39.840 --> 00:03:41.720 
so hopefully you can see that is 5/16 of
an<00:03:39.960> inch<00:03:40.080> that<00:03:40.320> 16<00:03:40.770> millimeters<00:03:41.250> which<00:03:41.430> is<00:03:41.610> the

00:03:41.720 --> 00:03:41.730 
an inch that 16 millimeters which is the

00:03:41.730 --> 00:03:44.000 
an inch that 16 millimeters which is the
standard<00:03:42.150> size<00:03:42.360> that's<00:03:43.050> how<00:03:43.200> long<00:03:43.440> it<00:03:43.620> is<00:03:43.740> and

00:03:44.000 --> 00:03:44.010 
standard size that's how long it is and

00:03:44.010 --> 00:03:48.620 
standard size that's how long it is and
it<00:03:44.550> is<00:03:44.700> a<00:03:44.730> 14<00:03:45.180> gauge<00:03:45.620> I<00:03:46.850> believe<00:03:47.850> your<00:03:48.150> pierced

00:03:48.620 --> 00:03:48.630 
it is a 14 gauge I believe your pierced

00:03:48.630 --> 00:03:51.410 
it is a 14 gauge I believe your pierced
with<00:03:48.840> a<00:03:49.110> 12<00:03:49.830> or<00:03:50.130> it<00:03:50.490> might<00:03:50.640> be<00:03:50.760> a<00:03:50.790> 14<00:03:51.150> I<00:03:51.180> don't

00:03:51.410 --> 00:03:51.420 
with a 12 or it might be a 14 I don't

00:03:51.420 --> 00:03:52.370 
with a 12 or it might be a 14 I don't
know<00:03:51.480> I<00:03:51.510> guess<00:03:51.750> every<00:03:51.960> place<00:03:52.170> is<00:03:52.350> different

00:03:52.370 --> 00:03:52.380 
know I guess every place is different

00:03:52.380 --> 00:03:55.700 
know I guess every place is different
but<00:03:53.250> I<00:03:53.670> was<00:03:53.970> pierced<00:03:54.360> with<00:03:54.540> the<00:03:54.660> 12<00:03:54.960> and<00:03:55.170> then

00:03:55.700 --> 00:03:55.710 
but I was pierced with the 12 and then

00:03:55.710 --> 00:03:58.520 
but I was pierced with the 12 and then
he<00:03:56.190> told<00:03:56.370> me<00:03:56.580> when<00:03:56.850> I<00:03:56.880> change<00:03:57.390> it<00:03:57.600> to<00:03:57.780> get<00:03:57.960> a<00:03:57.990> 14

00:03:58.520 --> 00:03:58.530 
he told me when I change it to get a 14

00:03:58.530 --> 00:04:01.070 
he told me when I change it to get a 14
gauge<00:03:58.710> so<00:03:59.400> it's<00:03:59.550> a<00:03:59.640> 14<00:04:00.000> gauge<00:04:00.150> 16<00:04:00.660> millimeter

00:04:01.070 --> 00:04:01.080 
gauge so it's a 14 gauge 16 millimeter

00:04:01.080 --> 00:04:03.830 
gauge so it's a 14 gauge 16 millimeter
bar<00:04:01.320> and<00:04:01.820> I'm<00:04:02.820> not<00:04:03.000> sure<00:04:03.180> what<00:04:03.300> size<00:04:03.420> the<00:04:03.660> balls

00:04:03.830 --> 00:04:03.840 
bar and I'm not sure what size the balls

00:04:03.840 --> 00:04:05.750 
bar and I'm not sure what size the balls
are<00:04:04.080> but<00:04:04.320> they're<00:04:04.740> a<00:04:04.770> little<00:04:05.100> bit<00:04:05.310> bigger<00:04:05.430> than
