00:00:01.220 --> 00:00:09.599
 Hi, I'm going to become a nephew 

00:00:05.819 --> 00:00:15.599
 from tutorials states and show you 

00:00:09.599 --> 00:00:18.690
 how to play simple role matters 

00:00:15.599 --> 00:00:19.890
 is just very easy 

00:00:18.690 --> 00:00:23.189
 to teach chords 

00:00:19.890 --> 00:00:25.500
 practicing several times alone is already 

00:00:23.189 --> 00:00:28.710
 in that you can within current 

00:00:25.500 --> 00:00:32.489
 So two three or four batteries you can 

00:00:28.710 --> 00:00:34.469
 already well-known songs play yes 

00:00:32.489 --> 00:00:37.489
 maybe it's also a favorite place 

00:00:34.469 --> 00:00:40.110
 besides , important favorite otherwise 

00:00:37.489 --> 00:00:41.700
 to play horizons because it does 

00:00:40.110 --> 00:00:45.570
 just so much more fun to play then 

00:00:41.700 --> 00:00:49.670
 you also ask for longer while playing guitar 

00:00:45.570 --> 00:00:52.440
 if it's fun I can play 

00:00:49.670 --> 00:01:01.260
 So then we start with life 

00:00:52.440 --> 00:01:04.619
 hugo lacour manages it so we do 

00:01:01.260 --> 00:01:11.299
 but need middle finger and 

00:01:04.619 --> 00:01:14.360
 ring finger here is the side from above 

00:01:11.299 --> 00:01:17.130
 and middle finger here the second 

00:01:14.360 --> 00:01:22.439
 It is also important to get close to here 

00:01:17.130 --> 00:01:29.270
 Here is this metal here his 

00:01:22.439 --> 00:01:29.270
 finger near to and answer 

00:01:29.650 --> 00:01:45.550
 all six sides so in the beginning all 

00:01:32.920 --> 00:01:47.950
 just a super boring then catch 

00:01:45.550 --> 00:02:06.250
 you just try it 

00:01:47.950 --> 00:02:09.550
 a pattern of roaming patent so good 

00:02:06.250 --> 00:02:11.290
 that was important to someone 

00:02:09.550 --> 00:02:18.180
 Do not touch the other times 

00:02:11.290 --> 00:02:20.140
 these two okay, after all, still practice this 

00:02:18.180 --> 00:02:22.800
 maybe two three four more 

00:02:20.140 --> 00:02:24.610
 then you can start already 

00:02:22.800 --> 00:02:27.270
 nachzuspielen again 

00:02:24.610 --> 00:02:27.270
 have fun
