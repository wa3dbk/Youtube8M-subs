basic install we've already run some of

00:00:36.230 --> 00:00:37.540 
basic install we've already run some of
the<00:00:36.320> wires<00:00:36.530> through<00:00:36.830> the<00:00:36.890> truck<00:00:37.190> just<00:00:37.370> because

00:00:37.540 --> 00:00:37.550 
the wires through the truck just because

00:00:37.550 --> 00:00:39.130 
the wires through the truck just because
we're<00:00:37.699> videotape<00:00:38.089> of<00:00:38.239> the<00:00:38.300> day<00:00:38.449> but<00:00:38.629> basically

we're videotape of the day but basically

00:00:39.140 --> 00:00:42.070 
we're videotape of the day but basically
we<00:00:39.800> have<00:00:39.980> we're<00:00:40.670> going<00:00:41.030> to<00:00:41.150> the<00:00:41.239> fuse<00:00:41.449> box<00:00:41.750> and

00:00:42.070 --> 00:00:42.080 
we have we're going to the fuse box and

00:00:42.080 --> 00:00:44.049 
we have we're going to the fuse box and
then<00:00:42.830> we'll<00:00:42.979> have<00:00:43.129> a<00:00:43.159> plug<00:00:43.489> that<00:00:43.640> goes<00:00:43.820> into

00:00:44.049 --> 00:00:44.059 
then we'll have a plug that goes into

00:00:44.059 --> 00:00:45.969 
then we'll have a plug that goes into
the<00:00:44.180> obeah<00:00:44.479> to<00:00:44.659> port<00:00:44.989> and<00:00:45.199> then<00:00:45.440> a<00:00:45.470> cable<00:00:45.860> that

the obeah to port and then a cable that

00:00:45.979 --> 00:00:47.740 
the obeah to port and then a cable that
runs<00:00:46.010> up<00:00:46.370> to<00:00:46.400> it<00:00:46.760> so<00:00:47.210> we'll<00:00:47.330> go<00:00:47.510> ahead<00:00:47.629> and

00:00:47.740 --> 00:00:47.750 
runs up to it so we'll go ahead and

00:00:47.750 --> 00:00:51.100 
runs up to it so we'll go ahead and
install<00:00:48.019> the<00:00:48.260> downloader<00:00:48.680> in<00:00:48.890> the<00:00:48.979> truck<00:00:49.960> as<00:00:50.960> I

00:01:46.710 --> 00:01:46.720 
plug which we have installed down at the

00:01:46.720 --> 00:01:48.990 
plug which we have installed down at the
bottom<00:01:46.920> once<00:01:47.920> everything's<00:01:48.460> plugged<00:01:48.670> in

hooked into the fuse box just a matter

00:01:51.640 --> 00:01:53.130 
hooked into the fuse box just a matter
of<00:01:51.729> powering<00:01:52.240> up<00:01:52.360> and<00:01:52.600> installing<00:01:52.899> the

00:02:03.779 --> 00:02:03.789 
download as I said earlier the GT tuner

00:02:03.789 --> 00:02:05.609 
download as I said earlier the GT tuner
is<00:02:03.939> a<00:02:03.970> downloader<00:02:04.479> and<00:02:04.689> monitor<00:02:05.080> all-in-one

00:02:05.609 --> 00:02:05.619 
is a downloader and monitor all-in-one

00:02:05.619 --> 00:02:07.499 
is a downloader and monitor all-in-one
so<00:02:05.920> not<00:02:06.069> only<00:02:06.220> does<00:02:06.429> it<00:02:06.490> add<00:02:06.700> your<00:02:06.909> horsepower

00:02:07.499 --> 00:02:07.509 
so not only does it add your horsepower

00:02:07.509 --> 00:02:10.109 
so not only does it add your horsepower
it'll<00:02:08.229> also<00:02:08.410> monitor<00:02:09.099> 15<00:02:09.610> different

00:02:10.109 --> 00:02:10.119 
it'll also monitor 15 different

00:02:10.119 --> 00:02:12.750 
it'll also monitor 15 different
parameters<00:02:10.630> on<00:02:10.810> the<00:02:10.959> truck<00:02:11.459> anything<00:02:12.459> from

parameters on the truck anything from

00:02:12.760 --> 00:02:16.110 
parameters on the truck anything from
your<00:02:13.000> speed<00:02:13.390> boost<00:02:14.290> pressure<00:02:15.120> exhaust

00:02:16.110 --> 00:02:16.120 
your speed boost pressure exhaust

your speed boost pressure exhaust
temperature<00:02:16.750> which<00:02:16.959> will<00:02:17.140> be<00:02:17.260> installing<00:02:17.590> a

00:02:17.759 --> 00:02:17.769 
temperature which will be installing a

like<00:02:23.200> so<00:02:23.319> there's<00:02:23.500> 15<00:02:23.830> different<00:02:24.870> parameters

00:02:25.860 --> 00:02:25.870 
like so there's 15 different parameters

00:02:25.870 --> 00:02:28.710 
like so there's 15 different parameters
that<00:02:25.900> it<00:02:26.170> will<00:02:26.350> read<00:02:27.310> and<00:02:27.609> you<00:02:28.359> can<00:02:28.510> pretty

00:02:28.710 --> 00:02:28.720 
that it will read and you can pretty

00:02:28.720 --> 00:02:30.930 
that it will read and you can pretty

00:03:23.640 --> 00:03:25.910 
here I'll be side the firewall and we
run<00:03:23.850> a<00:03:23.880> cable<00:03:24.180> the<00:03:24.900> actual<00:03:25.260> power<00:03:25.410> armor<00:03:25.680> probe

00:03:25.910 --> 00:03:25.920 
run a cable the actual power armor probe

over<00:03:26.460> to<00:03:26.610> the<00:03:26.760> downpipe<00:03:31.730> as<00:03:32.730> I<00:03:32.880> showed<00:03:33.090> you

00:03:33.260 --> 00:03:33.270 
over to the downpipe as I showed you

00:03:33.270 --> 00:03:35.180 
over to the downpipe as I showed you
earlier<00:03:33.300> we<00:03:33.900> installed<00:03:34.260> the<00:03:34.410> pyrometer<00:03:34.770> bong

00:03:35.180 --> 00:03:35.190 
earlier we installed the pyrometer bong

earlier we installed the pyrometer bong
in<00:03:35.460> the<00:03:35.580> down<00:03:35.760> pipe<00:03:36.170> so<00:03:37.170> all<00:03:37.530> we<00:03:37.650> have<00:03:37.800> to<00:03:37.920> do

00:03:38.000 --> 00:03:38.010 
in the down pipe so all we have to do

00:03:38.010 --> 00:03:41.030 
in the down pipe so all we have to do
now<00:03:38.190> is<00:03:38.400> put<00:03:38.580> the<00:03:38.610> cable<00:03:39.030> in<00:03:39.530> so<00:03:40.530> what<00:03:40.710> we<00:03:40.800> have

00:03:41.030 --> 00:03:41.040 
now is put the cable in so what we have

00:03:41.040 --> 00:03:43.310 
now is put the cable in so what we have
is<00:03:41.250> just<00:03:41.280> a<00:03:41.550> regular<00:03:41.880> k2<00:03:42.180> type<00:03:42.660> parameter

00:03:43.310 --> 00:03:43.320 
is just a regular k2 type parameter

00:03:43.320 --> 00:03:45.890 
is just a regular k2 type parameter
probe<00:03:43.560> comes<00:03:44.430> with<00:03:44.790> the<00:03:44.940> pyrometer<00:03:45.270> kit<00:03:45.660> from
