 choose fine and cheaper foods 

00:00:22.140 --> 00:00:27.560
 secondly, meat is our source 

00:00:25.320 --> 00:00:29.970
 main protein these molecules 

00:00:27.560 --> 00:00:31.380
 essential to our body 

00:00:29.970 --> 00:00:32.640
 and it's not the only one and you're going 

00:00:31.380 --> 00:00:34.739
 see that there are ways a lot 

00:00:32.640 --> 00:00:37.050
 more economical than meat for 

00:00:34.739 --> 00:00:39.450
 provide and proteins as much as the 

00:00:37.050 --> 00:00:40.980
 Animal protein high doses are 

00:00:39.450 --> 00:00:44.309
 bad for our health 

00:00:40.980 --> 00:00:46.440
 reporting b marotta builders and 

00:00:44.309 --> 00:00:47.940
 repairers of our body the proteins 

00:00:46.440 --> 00:00:49.110
 are one of the pillars of our 

00:00:47.940 --> 00:00:50.760
 food 

00:00:49.110 --> 00:00:53.190
 we find them essentially in the 

00:00:50.760 --> 00:00:54.510
 meat and eggs yet beside 

00:00:53.190 --> 00:00:56.670
 these products of animal origin 

00:00:54.510 --> 00:00:59.879
 there is another great source of 

00:00:56.670 --> 00:01:01.469
 unjustly underrated vegetable protein 

00:00:59.879 --> 00:01:03.059
 especially as specialists 

00:01:01.469 --> 00:01:05.250
 agree that the proteins 

00:01:03.059 --> 00:01:09.740
 are excellent for our 

00:01:05.250 --> 00:01:09.740
 health then for pluton to find them 

00:01:10.450 --> 00:01:14.619
 to find out we're going to follow anne 

00:01:12.250 --> 00:01:16.360
 clear a few years ago this former 

00:01:14.619 --> 00:01:17.670
 meat lover discovered that she 

00:01:16.360 --> 00:01:20.200
 could eat vegetable protein 

00:01:17.670 --> 00:01:22.000
 while keeping the fun 

00:01:20.200 --> 00:01:23.950
 for example by consuming 

00:01:22.000 --> 00:01:26.649
 cold cuts but deli meats 

00:01:23.950 --> 00:01:27.810
 vegetarian you have small 

00:01:26.649 --> 00:01:30.490
 washers 

00:01:27.810 --> 00:01:31.750
 a bit like salami whatever 

00:01:30.490 --> 00:01:33.310
 are their recipes that you have 

00:01:31.750 --> 00:01:34.780
 usually who are using worries 

00:01:33.310 --> 00:01:37.000
 I could put subscribing here you 

00:01:34.780 --> 00:01:38.950
 also have tofu from the patho o 

00:01:37.000 --> 00:01:40.659
 face imitates outright everything that is 

00:01:38.950 --> 00:01:43.240
 terrible if you want for example 

00:01:40.659 --> 00:01:44.530
 replace the smoked taste of bacon 

00:01:43.240 --> 00:01:46.990
 could take everything that is in 

00:01:44.530 --> 00:01:49.000
 smoke the secret of its deli meats 

00:01:46.990 --> 00:01:51.099
 they contain tofu 

00:01:49.000 --> 00:01:53.200
 that is to say very soybean paste 

00:01:51.099 --> 00:01:55.270
 rich in protein and flour 

00:01:53.200 --> 00:01:57.789
 Wheat it almost tastes like meat 

00:01:55.270 --> 00:02:01.000
 press that the texture of the meat but 

00:01:57.789 --> 00:02:02.829
 it is guaranteed 100% vegetable other great 

00:02:01.000 --> 00:02:03.610
 vegetable protein source the 

00:02:02.829 --> 00:02:05.619
 legumes 

00:02:03.610 --> 00:02:07.720
 in other words, the family of beans and 

00:02:05.619 --> 00:02:09.340
 lentils the best is the 

00:02:07.720 --> 00:02:11.620
 associate with cereals 

00:02:09.340 --> 00:02:12.910
 an association that is common is 

00:02:11.620 --> 00:02:14.769
 to cook rice 

00:02:12.910 --> 00:02:16.239
 and then to associate lenses with 

00:02:14.769 --> 00:02:18.280
 example between green lenses or 

00:02:16.239 --> 00:02:19.389
 then coral and donkey lenses 

00:02:18.280 --> 00:02:22.000
 kong is the cus very very fast 

00:02:19.389 --> 00:02:23.680
 they have a very good but another 

00:02:22.000 --> 00:02:25.180
 association that is traditional and 

00:02:23.680 --> 00:02:26.530
 found, for example, in america 

00:02:25.180 --> 00:02:29.290
 South is the association red beans 

00:02:26.530 --> 00:02:31.180
 with corn if you eat once per 

00:02:29.290 --> 00:02:33.579
 day he necessarily at the same time 

00:02:31.180 --> 00:02:36.190
 a serving of cereal and ion strength 

00:02:33.579 --> 00:02:38.680
 of legumes you will have your ration 

00:02:36.190 --> 00:02:40.060
 of protein a simple hue and you 

00:02:38.680 --> 00:02:41.450
 go see him especially 

00:02:40.060 --> 00:02:45.140
 economic 

00:02:41.450 --> 00:02:46.940
 demonstration at the supermarket here for 

00:02:45.140 --> 00:02:49.190
 a family of five the serving 

00:02:46.940 --> 00:02:50.920
 vegetable protein 100 g of 

00:02:49.190 --> 00:02:52.069
 legumes and mixed cereals 

00:02:50.920 --> 00:02:57.200
 verdict 

00:02:52.069 --> 00:02:58.459
 halak is a euro 97.6 no eating of 

00:02:57.200 --> 00:03:00.230
 vegetable protein so it's 

00:02:58.459 --> 00:03:02.150
 particularly economical 

00:03:00.230 --> 00:03:04.190
 okay but they're as good as 

00:03:02.150 --> 00:03:07.690
 the meat direction the kitchen of anne 

00:03:04.190 --> 00:03:07.690
 clear for some gourmet recipes 

00:03:09.140 --> 00:03:13.459
 first recipe the stem or false largo 

00:03:11.780 --> 00:03:15.470
 take silky tofu 

00:03:13.459 --> 00:03:17.480
 he will replace lakhsem and will be ten times 

00:03:15.470 --> 00:03:18.770
 fewer calories to prepare your 

00:03:17.480 --> 00:03:21.410
 art as usual 

00:03:18.770 --> 00:03:24.020
 finally add the tofu but by way of 

00:03:21.410 --> 00:03:25.370
 wrong reason and I compare to the end that 

00:03:24.020 --> 00:03:27.830
 I still have bacon 

00:03:25.370 --> 00:03:29.810
 I find that these have a taste more 

00:03:27.830 --> 00:03:31.760
 end and especially that they are a lot 

00:03:29.810 --> 00:03:34.570
 better in second and maybe a pan 

00:03:31.760 --> 00:03:37.100
 douich with vegetable sausages 

00:03:34.570 --> 00:03:39.190
 third reflects unrolled based on 

00:03:37.100 --> 00:03:45.250
 puff pastry with fake lists 

00:03:39.190 --> 00:03:45.250
 and finally 100% vegetable steak 

00:03:47.560 --> 00:03:51.340
 this steak made of tofu so soy 

00:03:50.050 --> 00:03:53.290
 can even find it in 

00:03:51.340 --> 00:03:58.590
 restaurants or deer in the form of 

00:03:53.290 --> 00:03:58.590
 hamburgers but what beautiful do they have
