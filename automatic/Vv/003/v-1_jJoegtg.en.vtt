00:00:05.240 --> 00:00:09.540
 nice so look at princess hairs i 

00:00:07.770 --> 00:00:11.849
 was asked for her to 

00:00:09.540 --> 00:00:14.549
 do after doing rosily from movie 

00:00:11.849 --> 00:00:16.740
 eclipse of the twilight saga 

00:00:14.549 --> 00:00:17.550
 so I don't think that's him yet 

00:00:16.740 --> 00:00:20.010
 done 

00:00:17.550 --> 00:00:21.270
 such an older movie older book but it is 

00:00:20.010 --> 00:00:23.609
 still a nice hairstyle 

00:00:21.270 --> 00:00:25.740
 so that we are going to do we box lee has 

00:00:23.609 --> 00:00:28.970
 in the middle they got a divorce so me 

00:00:25.740 --> 00:00:28.970
 just make a separation in the middle 

00:00:31.529 --> 00:00:35.130
 first wet the hair though 

00:00:33.510 --> 00:00:37.579
 then there is separation with a flat one 

00:00:35.130 --> 00:00:37.579
 with center 

00:00:38.340 --> 00:00:43.800
 see if it is right this is out of the 

00:00:41.430 --> 00:00:47.129
 fighting scene of eclipse 

00:00:43.800 --> 00:00:49.829
 tips in english so it looks 

00:00:47.129 --> 00:00:51.719
 pretty messy but it still is 

00:00:49.829 --> 00:00:53.070
 very nice 

00:00:51.719 --> 00:00:54.510
 you have two ways because i don't have one 

00:00:53.070 --> 00:00:56.100
 can discover if they really have one on 

00:00:54.510 --> 00:00:58.440
 bad or they just have one 

00:00:56.100 --> 00:01:00.359
 braid have caught so I decided 

00:00:58.440 --> 00:01:00.870
 to both of the ways in this video 

00:01:00.359 --> 00:01:03.120
 show 

00:01:00.870 --> 00:01:04.530
 the first is the easiest then you make 

00:01:03.120 --> 00:01:06.299
 just two bad ones in the front 

00:01:04.530 --> 00:01:08.250
 if you choose to just have two 

00:01:06.299 --> 00:01:12.630
 make braids then grab just a 

00:01:08.250 --> 00:01:14.640
 big lure to the ear has rosily 

00:01:12.630 --> 00:01:16.590
 obviously much thicker hair do the test 

00:01:14.640 --> 00:01:21.090
 will has so it falls differently 

00:01:16.590 --> 00:01:23.700
 of the hair and now you go pretty high 

00:01:21.090 --> 00:01:26.880
 make a flight with this curse 

00:01:23.700 --> 00:01:34.049
 so really divide this hair in here 

00:01:26.880 --> 00:01:38.670
 three and I just make three 

00:01:34.049 --> 00:01:40.470
 strands on the other hand does exactly 

00:01:38.670 --> 00:01:43.170
 the same so also here I take another 

00:01:40.470 --> 00:01:45.840
 skirt up just behind your ear that you are the real one 

00:01:43.170 --> 00:01:49.189
 who have front pick and also make here 

00:01:45.840 --> 00:01:49.189
 I just braid three strands 

00:01:50.450 --> 00:01:53.429
 when you're done with both the 

00:01:52.530 --> 00:01:55.140
 braids 

00:01:53.429 --> 00:01:57.119
 then they will first have to separate 

00:01:55.140 --> 00:01:59.069
 because if you do you will 

00:01:57.119 --> 00:02:01.049
 the next flight then you pull 

00:01:59.069 --> 00:02:03.960
 release him from the other braid 

00:02:01.049 --> 00:02:05.640
 she wants to have this oil is thicker 

00:02:03.960 --> 00:02:06.929
 this also quite thick but it also has a lot 

00:02:05.640 --> 00:02:10.560
 deeper hair 

00:02:06.929 --> 00:02:12.660
 first it stretches out the other side 

00:02:10.560 --> 00:02:15.780
 also and if you take them both apart 

00:02:12.660 --> 00:02:17.519
 have drawn this last harvest 

00:02:15.780 --> 00:02:19.110
 100 is really we so her that I leave 

00:02:17.519 --> 00:02:21.629
 just here too 

00:02:19.110 --> 00:02:24.170
 and pick it and then you just go 

00:02:21.629 --> 00:02:24.170
 poor 

00:02:24.269 --> 00:02:29.190
 we her it falls over one shoulder 

00:02:25.799 --> 00:02:33.599
 somewhat i fight and slightly 

00:02:29.190 --> 00:02:35.489
 continue from the middle so that he too 

00:02:33.599 --> 00:02:38.099
 can fall back on because that's it 

00:02:35.489 --> 00:02:41.269
 also in the film but of course 

00:02:38.099 --> 00:02:41.269
 over the shoulder and could fall 

00:02:45.940 --> 00:02:49.750
 the difficult place at the end 4 and 

00:02:47.590 --> 00:02:51.280
 solutions so I'm already quitting 

00:02:49.750 --> 00:02:52.930
 think tank this braid again 

00:02:51.280 --> 00:03:00.220
 apart so that it is all on thicker 

00:02:52.930 --> 00:03:02.410
 seems to be rid of just a piece 

00:03:00.220 --> 00:03:03.880
 and so you have the hair of rosily hal in 

00:03:02.410 --> 00:03:05.500
 the movie eclipse 

00:03:03.880 --> 00:03:07.150
 this is the first variation that i want 

00:03:05.500 --> 00:03:08.800
 show only in the movie I have 

00:03:07.150 --> 00:03:11.290
 seen her hair 

00:03:08.800 --> 00:03:13.750
 much more like this so now I'll be the other 

00:03:11.290 --> 00:03:15.580
 show variety but as soon as you get the 

00:03:13.750 --> 00:03:17.290
 could do 

00:03:15.580 --> 00:03:19.090
 I just start with the same divorce 

00:03:17.290 --> 00:03:20.470
 and also because you yourself are the only one 

00:03:19.090 --> 00:03:22.960
 namely have the idea that there is a piece 

00:03:20.470 --> 00:03:23.890
 when I am braided, I am going to get lost 

00:03:22.960 --> 00:03:26.770
 poor 

00:03:23.890 --> 00:03:31.120
 I don't undertake her at the first 

00:03:26.770 --> 00:03:34.260
 sheep zoiezo not here but I take so 

00:03:31.120 --> 00:03:34.260
 its top there 

00:03:39.140 --> 00:03:42.790
 and so I go back a bit 

00:03:44.150 --> 00:03:48.500
 I think that is very small 

00:03:45.470 --> 00:03:50.420
 piece so I'm just running away because 

00:03:48.500 --> 00:03:51.890
 this way, better than that 

00:03:50.420 --> 00:03:55.390
 its falling and it does not sink completely 

00:03:51.890 --> 00:03:55.390
 down into the braid Coming up 

00:03:58.220 --> 00:04:02.840
 this for be so immediately in the 

00:04:00.950 --> 00:04:04.610
 so braid one more 

00:04:02.840 --> 00:04:06.230
 bit down because I want him 

00:04:04.610 --> 00:04:08.209
 pull it apart here to make it 

00:04:06.230 --> 00:04:11.720
 natural pink dear all the way and the 

00:04:08.209 --> 00:04:13.900
 christan bed there is also 

00:04:11.720 --> 00:04:16.070
 adult hair and this is children's hair 

00:04:13.900 --> 00:04:18.549
 and this is how you pull it a bit 

00:04:16.070 --> 00:04:18.549
 tighter 

00:04:19.640 --> 00:04:23.300
 this I came kruidje others 

00:04:21.140 --> 00:04:25.820
 I can do now as second flights 

00:04:23.300 --> 00:04:28.040
 on a braided little piece but her is 

00:04:25.820 --> 00:04:29.570
 this pretty messy and in the front 

00:04:28.040 --> 00:04:32.180
 also a pick comes out so you can 

00:04:29.570 --> 00:04:33.860
 pluck tufts here now 

00:04:32.180 --> 00:04:35.240
 gently 

00:04:33.860 --> 00:04:38.720
 well ben tess that will happen anyway 

00:04:35.240 --> 00:04:42.350
 so sitting here with her anyway 

00:04:38.720 --> 00:04:44.479
 all kinds of runs that are loose 

00:04:42.350 --> 00:04:46.880
 that doesn't have to be extra 

00:04:44.479 --> 00:04:49.000
 pulling what I do now is just one 

00:04:46.880 --> 00:04:51.500
 Take the rubber band and put these two together 

00:04:49.000 --> 00:04:56.210
 and this pluck just goes with the braid 

00:04:51.500 --> 00:04:57.710
 who goes over her shoulder is herself 

00:04:56.210 --> 00:04:58.880
 actually a different form which makes the 

00:04:57.710 --> 00:05:00.590
 braid 

00:04:58.880 --> 00:05:03.080
 yes as I see it in the photo in that 

00:05:00.590 --> 00:05:03.590
 video you better see a bit higher 

00:05:03.080 --> 00:05:07.040
 stay 

00:05:03.590 --> 00:05:09.680
 well this looks pretty easy or missing 

00:05:07.040 --> 00:05:11.180
 freedom is messy to one side 

00:05:09.680 --> 00:05:12.470
 so here again I just grab three 

00:05:11.180 --> 00:05:14.360
 strands 

00:05:12.470 --> 00:05:19.430
 so a little out of the middle I flee 

00:05:14.360 --> 00:05:21.530
 now flies to one shoulder 

00:05:19.430 --> 00:05:25.520
 very loosely the rose oil sees that very well 

00:05:21.530 --> 00:05:27.890
 loose and she also still has a lot of it 

00:05:25.520 --> 00:05:29.690
 hanging over the shoulder is not 

00:05:27.890 --> 00:05:33.560
 braided is not necessarily chic 

00:05:29.690 --> 00:05:34.760
 down just about 

00:05:33.560 --> 00:05:38.660
 then I pull this out a little bit 

00:05:34.760 --> 00:05:40.910
 each other makes it bigger 

00:05:38.660 --> 00:05:44.390
 but as I have said a few times 

00:05:40.910 --> 00:05:46.840
 It is also pretty messy and rosalie 

00:05:44.390 --> 00:05:46.840
 so 

00:05:50.500 --> 00:05:56.200
 and I grab another human piece and 

00:05:52.780 --> 00:05:58.060
 this one came over her shoulder and would 

00:05:56.200 --> 00:05:58.840
 so we have the second way of the 

00:05:58.060 --> 00:06:01.000
 rosalie 

00:05:58.840 --> 00:06:02.440
 I am curious about which flight 

00:06:01.000 --> 00:06:03.850
 your preference 

00:06:02.440 --> 00:06:07.540
