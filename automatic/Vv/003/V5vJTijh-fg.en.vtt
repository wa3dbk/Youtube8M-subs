00:00:46.220 --> 00:00:46.230 
but it is a kind of geared towards

00:00:46.230 --> 00:00:47.960 
but it is a kind of geared towards
playing<00:00:46.470> with<00:00:46.590> your<00:00:46.739> friends<00:00:47.070> right<00:00:47.670> yeah<00:00:47.700> I

00:00:47.960 --> 00:00:47.970 
playing with your friends right yeah I

00:00:47.970 --> 00:00:50.090 
playing with your friends right yeah I
mean<00:00:48.300> there's<00:00:48.540> definitely<00:00:49.020> a<00:00:49.079> good<00:00:49.739> core

00:00:50.090 --> 00:00:50.100 
mean there's definitely a good core

00:00:50.100 --> 00:00:52.250 
mean there's definitely a good core
single-player<00:00:50.790> experience<00:00:51.059> there<00:00:51.899> but<00:00:52.230> I

00:00:52.250 --> 00:00:52.260 
single-player experience there but I

00:00:52.260 --> 00:00:54.530 
single-player experience there but I
think<00:00:52.590> I<00:00:53.010> think<00:00:53.550> that's<00:00:53.700> sort<00:00:53.850> of<00:00:53.969> missing<00:00:54.270> a

00:00:54.530 --> 00:00:54.540 
think I think that's sort of missing a

00:00:54.540 --> 00:00:57.110 
think I think that's sort of missing a
lot<00:00:54.690> of<00:00:54.750> the<00:00:55.350> appeal<00:00:55.739> of<00:00:55.770> this<00:00:56.070> game<00:00:56.340> is<00:00:56.610> just

gives<00:01:41.549> you<00:01:41.759> a<00:01:42.060> different<00:01:42.360> ability<00:01:42.750> as<00:01:43.259> you
