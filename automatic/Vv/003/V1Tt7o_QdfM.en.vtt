00:00:00.350 --> 00:00:05.330
 of all again for you greeting today 

00:00:02.870 --> 00:00:09.470
 I want to share a mask 

00:00:05.330 --> 00:00:12.560
 facial which already has a few 

00:00:09.470 --> 00:00:15.610
 days and then we will start the 

00:00:12.560 --> 00:00:19.600
 ingredients are honey 

00:00:15.610 --> 00:00:21.570
 ground amine or if you want you can put 

00:00:19.600 --> 00:00:25.600
 there is no problem 

00:00:21.570 --> 00:00:29.020
 whole milk I have it is not right and 

00:00:25.600 --> 00:00:31.270
 nothing is something to mix hopefully the 

00:00:29.020 --> 00:00:32.650
 mixer is preferably of 

00:00:31.270 --> 00:00:35.830
 plastic 

00:00:32.650 --> 00:00:38.020
 and the container the face I have 

00:00:35.830 --> 00:00:40.270
 previously wash i will do good 

00:00:38.020 --> 00:00:42.460
 amount because as I said in 

00:00:40.270 --> 00:00:44.950
 other videos of facial masks me 

00:00:42.460 --> 00:00:47.830
 like to apply the one on my hands and how 

00:00:44.950 --> 00:00:50.560
 is rather like careless with my 

00:00:47.830 --> 00:00:54.550
 masks then let's give the chance 

00:00:50.560 --> 00:00:57.480
 to the hands and to the box then we have 

00:00:54.550 --> 00:01:01.320
 start to this video 

00:00:57.480 --> 00:01:03.329
 well I'm going to mix the vein the amount 

00:01:01.320 --> 00:01:05.400
 that you wish 

00:01:03.329 --> 00:01:09.010
 I'm going to do a lot because my 

00:01:05.400 --> 00:01:11.880
 intention as I said is to take a face 

00:01:09.010 --> 00:01:11.880
 Honey 

00:01:13.700 --> 00:01:20.229
 it comes out pretty fast because I put it on 

00:01:16.130 --> 00:01:20.229
 fire chamber to melt it 

00:01:21.770 --> 00:01:27.030
 and milk 

00:01:24.690 --> 00:01:29.600
 if it is already caused to eat but we are not going 

00:01:27.030 --> 00:01:29.600
 to eat 

00:01:32.080 --> 00:01:35.520
 we proceed to mix 

00:01:42.730 --> 00:01:48.310
 if it was too watery as I have left 

00:01:45.040 --> 00:01:50.490
 this case then we apply more Avila 

00:01:48.310 --> 00:01:50.490
 molina 

00:02:31.900 --> 00:02:38.880
 the ingredient here again is milk 

00:02:35.550 --> 00:02:42.270
 the milk is excellent 

00:02:38.880 --> 00:02:47.720
 for the skin this is valid for 

00:02:42.270 --> 00:02:47.720
 any type and it is not going to apply 

00:02:52.100 --> 00:02:59.780
 as it has sugar this is not a 

00:02:55.060 --> 00:03:03.400
 exfoliating mask everything for you 

00:02:59.780 --> 00:03:03.400
 even my oatmeal is to die 

00:03:03.470 --> 00:03:08.740
 but to me the masks with oats in 

00:03:06.680 --> 00:03:08.740
 leaflets 

00:03:08.930 --> 00:03:12.340
 we do not see so almost 

00:03:19.010 --> 00:03:26.290
 people do not apply their eyes but to 

00:03:21.680 --> 00:03:26.290
 I like it also in the eyes 

00:03:32.660 --> 00:03:35.230
 ah 

00:03:39.750 --> 00:03:44.360
 the massage s circularly please 

00:03:48.110 --> 00:03:50.680
 to 

00:03:54.240 --> 00:03:59.790
 what is it to put your face so that now 

00:03:56.550 --> 00:04:02.810
 pores will enable the nutrition that you 

00:03:59.790 --> 00:04:02.810
 wants to give 

00:04:04.110 --> 00:04:07.710
 remember that honey is excellent because 

00:04:06.420 --> 00:04:11.090
 the help to counteract the 

00:04:07.710 --> 00:04:11.090
 aging of the skin 

00:04:11.420 --> 00:04:15.010
 obviously we're going to get old but I 

00:04:13.580 --> 00:04:17.610
 helps 

00:04:15.010 --> 00:04:17.610
 and a lot 

00:04:32.670 --> 00:04:39.360
 and then the mix that I 'm staying 

00:04:36.100 --> 00:04:39.360
 I'm going to apply in the hands 

00:04:44.390 --> 00:04:52.199
 and I suggest from here to there 

00:04:49.300 --> 00:04:52.199
 and massage 

00:05:10.320 --> 00:05:12.740
 ah 

00:05:30.980 --> 00:05:38.110
 natural face mask 

00:05:33.830 --> 00:05:38.110
 I like veneers cancers 

00:05:38.240 --> 00:05:42.050
 now 

00:05:39.810 --> 00:05:42.050
 ah 

00:06:05.639 --> 00:06:10.410
 and that's it 

00:06:07.540 --> 00:06:10.410
 ah 

00:06:12.030 --> 00:06:17.130
 I keep insisting I seem like a 

00:06:14.410 --> 00:06:17.130
 horror movie
