00:00:06.830 --> 00:00:10.740
 hello to all and all these evils reagan 

00:00:09.090 --> 00:00:12.389
 and so we find ourselves to find 

00:00:10.740 --> 00:00:14.129
 our friend measures who is so com 

00:00:12.389 --> 00:00:15.419
 like every week of Friday 

00:00:14.129 --> 00:00:17.430
 morning to Sunday morning 

00:00:15.419 --> 00:00:19.939
 which is so this time on the right 

00:00:17.430 --> 00:00:23.009
 from the tower to the ship hangar 

00:00:19.939 --> 00:00:25.320
 so who is that a little poor this 

00:00:23.009 --> 00:00:26.730
 week and we they try to us 

00:00:25.320 --> 00:00:29.849
 resell the stocks he failed to 

00:00:26.730 --> 00:00:32.040
 make it two weeks ago since 

00:00:29.849 --> 00:00:34.620
 we are reselling truth again so the 

00:00:32.040 --> 00:00:36.300
 rocket launcher that's not me I the 

00:00:34.620 --> 00:00:38.640
 take I 'll take it I can still 

00:00:36.300 --> 00:00:40.110
 taken from elsewhere but for the collection 

00:00:38.640 --> 00:00:41.370
 besides, I will not take it 

00:00:40.110 --> 00:00:44.430
 this time because I took to use 

00:00:41.370 --> 00:00:45.960
 my rooms for something else so his 

00:00:44.430 --> 00:00:47.670
 benefit because it's that it's 

00:00:45.960 --> 00:00:48.090
 damage to bissau so that's fine for 

00:00:47.670 --> 00:00:50.280
 their help 

00:00:48.090 --> 00:00:51.540
 on the other hand the rockets of this weapon 

00:00:50.280 --> 00:00:54.870
 can expose rather according to the 

00:00:51.540 --> 00:00:55.980
 proximity to the targets and that's it's a 

00:00:54.870 --> 00:00:57.960
 new thing because you can 

00:00:55.980 --> 00:01:00.000
 easily actually it's like when 

00:00:57.960 --> 00:01:01.530
 you send a grenade to an enemy 

00:01:00.000 --> 00:01:03.300
 who is close to you once 

00:01:01.530 --> 00:01:05.159
 you blow up with massa can do the 

00:01:03.300 --> 00:01:08.460
 same thing so it was a little 

00:01:05.159 --> 00:01:10.920
 the disadvantage of this weapon was then 

00:01:08.460 --> 00:01:12.899
 so we have the lan g of exotic helmets 

00:01:10.920 --> 00:01:16.170
 I will stop buying the 

00:01:12.899 --> 00:01:17.939
 years old g helmet it's going five minutes the 

00:01:16.170 --> 00:01:19.999
 solar milk teeth that are there enough 

00:01:17.939 --> 00:01:22.139
 frequently at measure 1 it's really 

00:01:19.999 --> 00:01:27.299
 it's good for organists 

00:01:22.139 --> 00:01:30.359
 So what does the solar doctrine 

00:01:27.299 --> 00:01:33.929
 sure the mask of the third man who is 

00:01:30.359 --> 00:01:37.020
 pretty stylish that is for them 

00:01:33.929 --> 00:01:39.450
 the sword hunters since it reduces 

00:01:37.020 --> 00:01:43.319
 the energy consumption of the super 

00:01:39.450 --> 00:01:45.450
 the swordsman as you have here here and 

00:01:43.319 --> 00:01:47.429
 and especially he is very stylish so I 

00:01:45.450 --> 00:01:51.719
 would have taken it well but I'm going first 

00:01:47.429 --> 00:01:54.270
 take that since the alpha crest 

00:01:51.719 --> 00:01:56.609
 the upi that will allow me to have a 

00:01:54.270 --> 00:01:57.990
 exo element for my titans who is not 

00:01:56.609 --> 00:02:01.219
 still level 20 may that will do I 

00:01:57.990 --> 00:02:05.060
 goes up very soon and so who is 

00:02:01.219 --> 00:02:07.169
 so what can I not show you 

00:02:05.060 --> 00:02:09.090
 I can not show it to you 

00:02:07.169 --> 00:02:11.520
 shame we animate the crew more 

00:02:09.090 --> 00:02:13.410
 quickly why not on the road 

00:02:11.520 --> 00:02:16.170
 it can be useful 

00:02:13.410 --> 00:02:19.320
 nothing exceptional about this 

00:02:16.170 --> 00:02:20.700
 alfa him worse for the titans if this 

00:02:19.320 --> 00:02:24.030
 is it increases the capacity of 

00:02:20.700 --> 00:02:25.380
 ammunition special weapons and that his 

00:02:24.030 --> 00:02:26.760
 increase for the main it's 

00:02:25.380 --> 00:02:27.830
 on automatic rifles so that's 

00:02:26.760 --> 00:02:30.000
 a good thing 

00:02:27.830 --> 00:02:33.090
 So here I am I am going to buy it 

00:02:30.000 --> 00:02:35.430
 this is done then we always 

00:02:33.090 --> 00:02:38.130
 the same the same little accessories 

00:02:35.430 --> 00:02:40.830
 which allow you to speed up the 

00:02:38.130 --> 00:02:42.810
 pace of improvement of your weapons 

00:02:40.830 --> 00:02:45.240
 small engines for your sparrows so 

00:02:42.810 --> 00:02:47.970
 blue and green this week and cartridges 

00:02:45.240 --> 00:02:48.420
 heavy weapons for a room 

00:02:47.970 --> 00:02:51.870
 strange 

00:02:48.420 --> 00:02:53.850
 we will also test the small 

00:02:51.870 --> 00:02:56.430
 little halloween starec that consisted 

00:02:53.850 --> 00:02:57.990
 to bring the lantern olite by going 

00:02:56.430 --> 00:03:01.140
 see steps for him to give us a 

00:02:57.990 --> 00:03:02.760
 vial of 10 off the air that allows 

00:03:01.140 --> 00:03:05.010
 having a spawn shaped bald 

00:03:02.760 --> 00:03:06.060
 mouse so listen we'll test that I 

00:03:05.010 --> 00:03:08.400
 will test it live 

00:03:06.060 --> 00:03:11.340
 if it works it would put him in the video 

00:03:08.400 --> 00:03:15.270
 so simply the olic lantern 

00:03:11.340 --> 00:03:17.370
 who is there here I am a pumpkin 

00:03:15.270 --> 00:03:20.150
 is not it a little bit of 

00:03:17.370 --> 00:03:25.050
 fashion but hey we 'll interact with him 

00:03:20.150 --> 00:03:27.570
 and it does not work so that's so 

00:03:25.050 --> 00:03:30.150
 at least we know that it does not 

00:03:27.570 --> 00:03:31.500
 not work so it worked so that 

00:03:30.150 --> 00:03:34.080
 during the halloween period 

00:03:31.500 --> 00:03:35.820
 so that's so it was 

00:03:34.080 --> 00:03:38.670
 inventory of measurements for this 

00:03:35.820 --> 00:03:39.720
 week nothing crazy I hope the 

00:03:38.670 --> 00:03:41.820
 next week will be a better 

00:03:39.720 --> 00:03:43.350
 week and you can spend your 

00:03:41.820 --> 00:03:45.630
 strange break in things a little 

00:03:43.350 --> 00:03:47.400
 more interesting and I hope you 

00:03:45.630 --> 00:03:50.060
 cross very quickly whether it's at stake or 

00:03:47.400 --> 00:03:50.060
 on the chain
