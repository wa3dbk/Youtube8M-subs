00:00:22.910 --> 00:00:22.920 
and these boots I've actually had for

00:00:22.920 --> 00:00:25.189 
and these boots I've actually had for
quite<00:00:23.039> a<00:00:23.160> few<00:00:23.400> years<00:00:23.490> and<00:00:24.119> what<00:00:24.810> I<00:00:24.840> really

00:00:25.189 --> 00:00:25.199 
quite a few years and what I really

00:00:25.199 --> 00:00:27.470 
quite a few years and what I really
liked<00:00:25.439> about<00:00:25.560> this<00:00:25.859> pair<00:00:26.160> was<00:00:26.519> the<00:00:26.939> quilting

00:00:27.470 --> 00:00:27.480 
liked about this pair was the quilting

00:00:27.480 --> 00:00:29.300 
liked about this pair was the quilting
detail<00:00:27.840> around<00:00:28.019> the<00:00:28.289> top<00:00:28.529> of<00:00:28.710> the<00:00:28.830> shoe<00:00:29.039> as

00:00:29.300 --> 00:00:29.310 
detail around the top of the shoe as

00:00:29.310 --> 00:00:32.330 
detail around the top of the shoe as
well<00:00:29.609> as<00:00:30.029> the<00:00:30.240> zipper<00:00:30.689> has<00:00:31.230> this<00:00:31.769> nice<00:00:32.099> little

00:00:32.330 --> 00:00:32.340 
well as the zipper has this nice little

00:00:32.340 --> 00:00:34.549 
well as the zipper has this nice little
metal<00:00:32.759> detailing<00:00:33.239> which<00:00:33.630> I<00:00:33.809> think<00:00:34.079> gives<00:00:34.320> it<00:00:34.530> a

00:00:34.549 --> 00:00:34.559 
metal detailing which I think gives it a

00:00:34.559 --> 00:00:36.650 
metal detailing which I think gives it a
little<00:00:34.829> bit<00:00:35.070> something<00:00:35.280> special<00:00:35.910> and<00:00:36.180> I

00:00:36.650 --> 00:00:36.660 
little bit something special and I

00:00:36.660 --> 00:00:38.569 
little bit something special and I
overall<00:00:37.050> just<00:00:37.260> really<00:00:37.559> love<00:00:37.800> this<00:00:38.010> pair<00:00:38.280> and<00:00:38.550> I

00:00:38.569 --> 00:00:38.579 
overall just really love this pair and I

00:00:38.579 --> 00:00:40.190 
overall just really love this pair and I
think<00:00:38.790> it's<00:00:38.910> a<00:00:39.030> great<00:00:39.180> transitional<00:00:39.899> pair

00:00:40.190 --> 00:00:40.200 
think it's a great transitional pair

00:00:40.200 --> 00:00:45.470 
think it's a great transitional pair
from<00:00:41.270> summer<00:00:42.270> to<00:00:42.390> fall<00:00:43.520> so<00:00:44.520> my<00:00:44.640> next<00:00:44.700> pair<00:00:45.210> is<00:00:45.239> a

00:00:45.470 --> 00:00:45.480 
from summer to fall so my next pair is a

00:00:45.480 --> 00:00:47.150 
from summer to fall so my next pair is a
pair<00:00:45.840> that's<00:00:46.050> very<00:00:46.230> similar<00:00:46.559> to<00:00:46.800> that<00:00:46.890> but

00:00:47.150 --> 00:00:47.160 
pair that's very similar to that but

00:00:47.160 --> 00:00:48.950 
pair that's very similar to that but
they<00:00:47.250> have<00:00:47.399> a<00:00:47.610> little<00:00:47.850> bit<00:00:48.090> maybe<00:00:48.329> shorter

00:00:48.950 --> 00:00:48.960 
they have a little bit maybe shorter

00:00:48.960 --> 00:00:52.040 
they have a little bit maybe shorter
heel<00:00:49.289> and<00:00:49.890> a<00:00:50.280> little<00:00:50.550> bit<00:00:50.670> of<00:00:50.879> a<00:00:50.940> bigger<00:00:51.660> heel

00:00:52.040 --> 00:00:52.050 
heel and a little bit of a bigger heel

00:00:52.050 --> 00:00:54.319 
heel and a little bit of a bigger heel
at<00:00:52.230> the<00:00:52.379> bottom<00:00:52.739> so<00:00:53.070> they're<00:00:53.280> a<00:00:53.309> lot<00:00:53.640> easier<00:00:54.120> to

00:00:54.319 --> 00:00:54.329 
at the bottom so they're a lot easier to

00:00:54.329 --> 00:00:56.240 
at the bottom so they're a lot easier to
walk<00:00:54.539> in<00:00:54.809> they're<00:00:55.320> also<00:00:55.469> really<00:00:55.980> really

00:00:56.240 --> 00:00:56.250 
walk in they're also really really

00:00:56.250 --> 00:00:58.610 
walk in they're also really really
comfortable<00:00:56.640> so<00:00:57.090> these<00:00:57.390> are<00:00:57.660> my<00:00:57.899> Naturalizer

00:00:58.610 --> 00:00:58.620 
comfortable so these are my Naturalizer

00:00:58.620 --> 00:01:01.910 
comfortable so these are my Naturalizer

West<00:02:20.709> must<00:02:21.099> use<00:02:21.489> the<00:02:21.700> same<00:02:21.940> manufacturer<00:02:22.569> to

00:02:23.010 --> 00:02:23.020 
West must use the same manufacturer to

00:02:23.020 --> 00:02:25.920 
West must use the same manufacturer to
make<00:02:23.170> their<00:02:23.440> shoes<00:02:24.090> because<00:02:25.090> these<00:02:25.660> are

00:02:25.920 --> 00:02:25.930 
make their shoes because these are

00:02:25.930 --> 00:02:28.020 
make their shoes because these are
pretty<00:02:26.200> much<00:02:26.380> identical<00:02:26.650> to<00:02:27.190> the<00:02:27.550> other<00:02:27.700> pair

00:02:28.020 --> 00:02:28.030 
pretty much identical to the other pair

00:02:28.030 --> 00:02:30.449 
pretty much identical to the other pair
and<00:02:28.360> I<00:02:28.989> had<00:02:29.200> one<00:02:29.410> of<00:02:29.530> these<00:02:29.650> the<00:02:29.860> year<00:02:30.040> prior

00:02:30.449 --> 00:02:30.459 
and I had one of these the year prior

00:02:30.459 --> 00:02:32.729 
and I had one of these the year prior
but<00:02:30.880> they<00:02:31.000> had<00:02:31.120> sold<00:02:31.360> out<00:02:31.450> in<00:02:31.540> my<00:02:31.660> size<00:02:31.959> so<00:02:32.410> I

00:02:32.729 --> 00:02:32.739 
but they had sold out in my size so I

00:02:32.739 --> 00:02:34.770 
but they had sold out in my size so I
was<00:02:33.160> really<00:02:33.459> happy<00:02:33.760> to<00:02:33.940> see<00:02:34.030> them<00:02:34.330> last<00:02:34.569> year

00:02:34.770 --> 00:02:34.780 
was really happy to see them last year

00:02:34.780 --> 00:02:37.229 
was really happy to see them last year
when<00:02:35.019> they<00:02:35.110> came<00:02:35.290> in<00:02:35.500> stock<00:02:35.830> again<00:02:36.280> I'm<00:02:37.060> pretty

00:02:37.229 --> 00:02:37.239 
when they came in stock again I'm pretty

00:02:37.239 --> 00:02:38.580 
when they came in stock again I'm pretty
sure<00:02:37.480> they<00:02:37.660> have<00:02:37.690> them<00:02:37.989> pretty<00:02:38.170> much<00:02:38.260> each

00:02:38.580 --> 00:02:38.590 
sure they have them pretty much each

00:02:38.590 --> 00:02:40.710 
sure they have them pretty much each
year<00:02:39.160> but<00:02:39.580> I<00:02:39.610> bought<00:02:39.880> them<00:02:40.060> in<00:02:40.150> August<00:02:40.330> of<00:02:40.660> last

00:02:40.710 --> 00:02:40.720

00:02:40.720 --> 00:02:43.050 
year but I bought them in August of last
year<00:02:41.110> and<00:02:41.470> they're<00:02:41.620> literally<00:02:41.890> my<00:02:42.160> other<00:02:42.580> pair

00:02:43.050 --> 00:02:43.060 
year and they're literally my other pair

00:02:43.060 --> 00:02:45.020 
year and they're literally my other pair

00:03:06.509 --> 00:03:06.519
