00:00:04.040 --> 00:00:07.499 
to show you the land this is the
Himalayan<00:00:05.040> salt<00:00:05.720> lamp

00:00:07.499 --> 00:00:07.509 
Himalayan salt lamp

00:00:07.509 --> 00:00:14.600 
Himalayan salt lamp
it's<00:00:07.959> a<00:00:08.049> hopeful

00:00:14.600 --> 00:00:14.610 

00:00:14.610 --> 00:00:16.950 

if<00:00:14.910> you<00:00:15.089> can<00:00:15.330> see<00:00:15.629> in<00:00:15.690> a<00:00:15.929> beautiful<00:00:16.500> way

00:00:16.950 --> 00:00:16.960 
if you can see in a beautiful way

00:00:16.960 --> 00:00:19.970 
if you can see in a beautiful way
it's<00:00:17.589> Himalayan<00:00:18.220> so<00:00:18.490> it<00:00:18.699> looks<00:00:18.880> like<00:00:18.970> texture

00:00:19.970 --> 00:00:19.980 
it's Himalayan so it looks like texture

00:00:19.980 --> 00:00:22.720 
it's Himalayan so it looks like texture
so<00:00:20.980> beautiful

00:00:22.720 --> 00:00:22.730 
so beautiful

00:00:22.730 --> 00:00:25.230 
so beautiful
what<00:00:23.119> happened<00:00:23.480> lift<00:00:23.630> it<00:00:23.810> up<00:00:23.930> right

00:00:25.230 --> 00:00:25.240 
what happened lift it up right

00:00:25.240 --> 00:00:27.660 
what happened lift it up right
definitely<00:00:26.140> flew<00:00:26.470> for<00:00:26.830> her<00:00:26.980> to<00:00:27.160> go<00:00:27.310> over<00:00:27.520> there

00:00:27.660 --> 00:00:27.670 
definitely flew for her to go over there

00:00:27.670 --> 00:00:31.000 
definitely flew for her to go over there
warm

00:00:31.000 --> 00:00:31.010 

00:00:31.010 --> 00:00:33.430 

and<00:00:31.280> these<00:00:31.610> little<00:00:32.150> I'm<00:00:32.750> gonna<00:00:32.990> spend<00:00:33.260> in

00:00:33.430 --> 00:00:33.440 
and these little I'm gonna spend in

00:00:33.440 --> 00:00:36.460 
and these little I'm gonna spend in
another<00:00:33.710> video<00:00:33.890> but<00:00:34.250> the<00:00:34.760> negative<00:00:35.270> ions<00:00:35.840> okay

00:00:36.460 --> 00:00:36.470 
another video but the negative ions okay

00:00:36.470 --> 00:00:51.330 
another video but the negative ions okay
I<00:00:38.320> have<00:00:39.320> one<00:00:39.350> in<00:00:39.710> here<00:00:40.630> and<00:00:41.630> another<00:00:41.840> one<00:00:41.960> there

00:00:51.330 --> 00:00:51.340 

00:00:51.340 --> 00:00:55.940 

this<00:00:51.490> is<00:00:51.640> a<00:00:51.670> big<00:00:51.940> book

00:00:55.940 --> 00:00:55.950 

00:00:55.950 --> 00:01:00.380 

now<00:00:57.470> we<00:00:58.470> think<00:00:58.680> about

00:01:00.380 --> 00:01:00.390 
now we think about

00:01:00.390 --> 00:01:05.360 
now we think about
negative<00:01:01.230> ions<00:01:01.620> which<00:01:01.920> these<00:01:03.140> lands<00:01:04.370> they

00:01:05.360 --> 00:01:05.370 
negative ions which these lands they

00:01:05.370 --> 00:01:10.340 
negative ions which these lands they
release<00:01:05.970> negative<00:01:06.810> ions<00:01:07.170> in<00:01:07.500> the<00:01:09.350> atmosphere

00:01:10.340 --> 00:01:10.350 
release negative ions in the atmosphere

00:01:10.350 --> 00:01:12.649 
release negative ions in the atmosphere
but<00:01:10.500> in<00:01:10.560> our<00:01:10.770> environment<00:01:11.130> here<00:01:11.670> in<00:01:12.270> the<00:01:12.390> room

00:01:12.649 --> 00:01:12.659 
but in our environment here in the room

00:01:12.659 --> 00:01:14.540 
but in our environment here in the room
if<00:01:13.200> you<00:01:13.380> had<00:01:13.530> them<00:01:13.680> in<00:01:13.770> your<00:01:13.860> room<00:01:14.100> is<00:01:14.369> gonna

00:01:14.540 --> 00:01:14.550 
if you had them in your room is gonna

00:01:14.550 --> 00:01:18.350 
if you had them in your room is gonna
let<00:01:14.909> out<00:01:15.920> negative<00:01:16.920> ions<00:01:17.430> let's<00:01:18.060> pray<00:01:18.270> more

00:01:18.350 --> 00:01:18.360 
let out negative ions let's pray more

00:01:18.360 --> 00:01:22.460 
let out negative ions let's pray more
about<00:01:18.660> that<00:01:18.810> but<00:01:18.960> basically<00:01:19.080> I<00:01:21.140> it's<00:01:22.140> very

00:01:22.460 --> 00:01:22.470 
about that but basically I it's very

00:01:22.470 --> 00:01:24.440 
about that but basically I it's very
important<00:01:23.100> these<00:01:23.220> lumps<00:01:23.670> and<00:01:24.030> I'll<00:01:24.180> tell<00:01:24.390> you

00:01:24.440 --> 00:01:24.450 
important these lumps and I'll tell you

00:01:24.450 --> 00:01:27.260 
important these lumps and I'll tell you
why<00:01:24.540> and<00:01:24.960> you<00:01:25.470> also<00:01:25.700> can<00:01:26.700> do<00:01:26.850> something<00:01:27.060> else

00:01:27.260 --> 00:01:27.270 
why and you also can do something else

00:01:27.270 --> 00:01:28.969 
why and you also can do something else
you<00:01:27.479> can<00:01:27.509> take<00:01:27.840> the<00:01:27.990> shower<00:01:28.290> try<00:01:28.650> to<00:01:28.710> take<00:01:28.950> a

you can take the shower try to take a

00:01:28.979 --> 00:01:31.700 
you can take the shower try to take a
shower<00:01:29.280> you<00:01:30.240> know<00:01:30.390> I<00:01:30.420> mean<00:01:30.810> I<00:01:30.930> would<00:01:31.110> love<00:01:31.500> to

have a problem because running water

00:01:34.470 --> 00:01:38.330 
have a problem because running water
also<00:01:34.950> releases<00:01:35.820> negative<00:01:36.060> ions<00:01:36.830> get<00:01:37.830> my<00:01:38.070> quan

00:01:38.330 --> 00:01:38.340

00:02:01.700 --> 00:02:01.710 

00:02:01.710 --> 00:02:04.020 

when<00:02:02.280> it's<00:02:02.430> like<00:02:02.760> this

00:02:04.020 --> 00:02:04.030 
when it's like this

00:02:04.030 --> 00:02:10.029 
when it's like this
see<00:02:05.030> the<00:02:05.180> phone<00:02:06.399> look<00:02:07.399> and<00:02:08.080> when<00:02:09.080> it's<00:02:09.229> very

00:02:10.029 --> 00:02:10.039 
see the phone look and when it's very

00:02:10.039 --> 00:02:16.650 
see the phone look and when it's very
cloudy<00:02:13.390> if<00:02:14.390> you<00:02:14.540> have<00:02:14.690> a<00:02:14.720> lot<00:02:14.870> of<00:02:14.900> these<00:02:15.140> days

00:02:16.650 --> 00:02:16.660 
cloudy if you have a lot of these days

00:02:16.660 --> 00:02:20.440 
cloudy if you have a lot of these days
certain<00:02:17.660> areas<00:02:18.140> like<00:02:18.410> I<00:02:19.209> believe<00:02:20.209> this

00:02:20.440 --> 00:02:20.450 
certain areas like I believe this

00:02:20.450 --> 00:02:24.720 
certain areas like I believe this
Washington<00:02:21.050> State<00:02:22.840> organ

00:02:24.720 --> 00:02:24.730 
Washington State organ

00:02:24.730 --> 00:02:27.000 
Washington State organ
and<00:02:25.060> I<00:02:25.390> guess<00:02:25.690> it<00:02:25.930> places<00:02:26.349> in<00:02:26.500> Europe<00:02:26.800> like

00:02:27.000 --> 00:02:27.010 
and I guess it places in Europe like

00:02:27.010 --> 00:02:29.670 
and I guess it places in Europe like
England<00:02:27.580> you<00:02:28.540> have<00:02:28.690> days<00:02:28.900> like<00:02:29.140> that<00:02:29.200> with<00:02:29.500> so

00:02:29.670 --> 00:02:29.680 
England you have days like that with so

00:02:29.680 --> 00:02:33.539 
England you have days like that with so
much<00:02:29.799> cloudiness<00:02:30.450> you<00:02:31.450> have<00:02:32.440> a<00:02:32.519> tendency<00:02:33.519> to

00:02:33.539 --> 00:02:33.549 
much cloudiness you have a tendency to

00:02:33.549 --> 00:02:36.570 
much cloudiness you have a tendency to
feel<00:02:33.940> very<00:02:34.180> fatigued<00:02:34.900> now<00:02:35.830> decided<00:02:36.310> to<00:02:36.430> do

00:02:36.570 --> 00:02:36.580 
feel very fatigued now decided to do

00:02:36.580 --> 00:02:40.410 
feel very fatigued now decided to do
anything<00:02:37.470> my<00:02:38.470> galaxies<00:02:39.010> are<00:02:39.250> cured<00:02:40.060> gonna

00:02:40.410 --> 00:02:40.420 
anything my galaxies are cured gonna

00:02:40.420 --> 00:02:45.150 
anything my galaxies are cured gonna
save<00:02:40.659> you<00:02:40.840> can<00:02:41.049> sing<00:02:41.610> so<00:02:42.610> tiny<00:02:42.940> Twizy<00:02:43.480> I<00:02:44.160> guess

00:02:45.150 --> 00:02:45.160 
save you can sing so tiny Twizy I guess

00:02:45.160 --> 00:02:51.480 
save you can sing so tiny Twizy I guess
it<00:02:45.310> could<00:02:45.489> save<00:02:45.670> me<00:02:45.790> so<00:02:45.970> little

00:02:51.480 --> 00:02:51.490 

00:02:51.490 --> 00:02:53.580 

you<00:02:52.060> can<00:02:52.240> start<00:02:52.480> T<00:02:52.780> you<00:02:53.200> don't<00:02:53.350> feel<00:02:53.470> like

00:02:53.580 --> 00:02:53.590 
you can start T you don't feel like

00:02:53.590 --> 00:02:56.160 
you can start T you don't feel like
doing<00:02:53.710> anything<00:02:53.890> your<00:02:54.640> tire<00:02:55.000> right<00:02:55.510> here

00:02:56.160 --> 00:02:56.170 
doing anything your tire right here

00:02:56.170 --> 00:03:01.140 
doing anything your tire right here
comes<00:02:57.120> is<00:02:58.120> tired<00:02:58.510> so<00:02:59.080> you<00:02:59.350> need<00:03:00.040> you<00:03:00.730> having<00:03:01.060> a

00:03:01.140 --> 00:03:01.150 
comes is tired so you need you having a

00:03:01.150 --> 00:03:05.220 
comes is tired so you need you having a
lot<00:03:01.300> more<00:03:01.540> positive<00:03:02.430> ions<00:03:03.430> and<00:03:03.760> negative<00:03:04.230> it's

00:03:05.220 --> 00:03:05.230 
lot more positive ions and negative it's

00:03:05.230 --> 00:03:06.960 
lot more positive ions and negative it's
everything<00:03:05.530> when<00:03:05.800> it's<00:03:05.980> a<00:03:06.130> lot<00:03:06.280> of<00:03:06.400> dry<00:03:06.670> wind

00:03:06.960 --> 00:03:06.970 
everything when it's a lot of dry wind

00:03:06.970 --> 00:03:09.990 
everything when it's a lot of dry wind
like<00:03:07.240> in<00:03:07.360> the<00:03:07.480> desert<00:03:07.930> or<00:03:08.590> you<00:03:09.430> get<00:03:09.610> a<00:03:09.640> me<00:03:09.820> and

00:03:09.990 --> 00:03:10.000 
like in the desert or you get a me and

00:03:10.000 --> 00:03:11.430 
like in the desert or you get a me and
you<00:03:10.090> don't<00:03:10.570> have<00:03:10.660> to<00:03:10.780> be<00:03:10.870> in<00:03:10.930> the<00:03:11.020> desert<00:03:11.410> to

00:06:17.540 --> 00:06:17.550 
can see how you want it but when people

00:06:17.550 --> 00:06:19.880 
can see how you want it but when people
for<00:06:17.670> reg<00:06:17.850> men<00:06:18.060> say<00:06:18.240> no<00:06:18.420> its<00:06:18.660> life<00:06:18.890> it's

00:06:19.880 --> 00:06:19.890 
for reg men say no its life it's

armadillo<00:06:20.550> its<00:06:20.730> armory<00:06:21.030> yeah<00:06:22.700> we<00:06:23.700> shouldn't

00:06:23.960 --> 00:06:23.970 
armadillo its armory yeah we shouldn't

00:06:23.970 --> 00:06:26.570 
armadillo its armory yeah we shouldn't
correct<00:06:24.270> anyone<00:06:24.660> I'm<00:06:24.840> just<00:06:25.410> saying<00:06:25.680> that<00:06:25.950> Nia

00:06:26.570 --> 00:06:26.580 
correct anyone I'm just saying that Nia

00:06:26.580 --> 00:06:29.270 
correct anyone I'm just saying that Nia
gotta<00:06:26.820> Falls<00:06:27.240> should<00:06:27.720> be<00:06:27.840> Nia<00:06:28.020> gotta<00:06:28.260> know<00:06:28.860> if

00:06:29.270 --> 00:06:29.280 
gotta Falls should be Nia gotta know if

00:06:29.280 --> 00:06:33.670 
gotta Falls should be Nia gotta know if
anything<00:06:29.790> because<00:06:30.440> it's<00:06:31.440> the<00:06:31.560> language

00:06:33.670 --> 00:06:33.680 
anything because it's the language

00:06:33.680 --> 00:06:38.870 
anything because it's the language
anyway<00:06:36.440> so<00:06:37.440> dinner<00:06:37.680> gotta<00:06:37.980> falls<00:06:38.280> it<00:06:38.610> would<00:06:38.730> be

00:06:38.870 --> 00:06:38.880 
anyway so dinner gotta falls it would be

00:06:38.880 --> 00:06:42.350 
anyway so dinner gotta falls it would be
a<00:06:39.210> good<00:06:39.660> place<00:06:39.720> for<00:06:39.960> negative<00:06:40.650> ions<00:06:41.040> so<00:06:41.760> if<00:06:42.240> you

00:06:42.350 --> 00:06:42.360 
a good place for negative ions so if you

00:06:42.360 --> 00:06:47.870 
a good place for negative ions so if you
go<00:06:42.510> there<00:06:42.630> you<00:06:42.750> Paula<00:06:42.960> get<00:06:43.200> a<00:06:45.830> good<00:06:46.830> amount<00:06:47.310> of

00:06:47.870 --> 00:06:47.880 
go there you Paula get a good amount of

00:06:47.880 --> 00:06:49.430 
go there you Paula get a good amount of
negative<00:06:48.060> ions<00:06:48.600> which<00:06:48.810> is<00:06:48.960> very<00:06:49.170> good<00:06:49.230> for

00:06:49.430 --> 00:06:49.440 
negative ions which is very good for

00:06:49.440 --> 00:06:51.080 
negative ions which is very good for
your<00:06:49.530> immune<00:06:49.590> system<00:06:49.920> but<00:06:50.700> it<00:06:50.820> also<00:06:50.970> feels

00:06:51.080 --> 00:06:51.090 
your immune system but it also feels

00:06:51.090 --> 00:06:55.520 
your immune system but it also feels
immediately<00:06:51.900> you<00:06:52.050> feel<00:06:53.360> energized<00:06:54.360> you<00:06:55.320> feel

00:06:55.520 --> 00:06:55.530 
immediately you feel energized you feel

00:06:55.530 --> 00:06:59.600 
immediately you feel energized you feel
happy<00:06:56.090> you<00:06:57.090> know<00:06:57.210> you<00:06:57.270> have<00:06:57.840> energy<00:06:58.160> for<00:06:59.160> those

00:06:59.600 --> 00:06:59.610 
happy you know you have energy for those

00:06:59.610 --> 00:07:02.300 
happy you know you have energy for those
of<00:06:59.760> you<00:06:59.880> have<00:07:00.060> fatigues<00:07:00.600> if<00:07:01.440> your<00:07:01.650> fatigue<00:07:02.100> is

00:07:02.300 --> 00:07:02.310 
of you have fatigues if your fatigue is

00:07:02.310 --> 00:07:04.610 
of you have fatigues if your fatigue is
because<00:07:02.640> you're<00:07:02.820> having<00:07:02.940> too<00:07:03.240> much<00:07:03.620> positive

00:07:04.610 --> 00:07:04.620 
because you're having too much positive

00:07:04.620 --> 00:07:07.790 
because you're having too much positive
ions<00:07:05.010> and<00:07:05.370> I'm<00:07:05.520> suspect<00:07:06.240> no<00:07:06.750> I<00:07:06.990> mean<00:07:07.380> you<00:07:07.620> can

00:07:07.790 --> 00:07:07.800 
ions and I'm suspect no I mean you can

00:07:07.800 --> 00:07:12.010 
ions and I'm suspect no I mean you can
create<00:07:08.730> your<00:07:08.850> own<00:07:10.160> theory<00:07:11.160> leads<00:07:11.490> but

00:07:12.010 --> 00:07:12.020 
create your own theory leads but

00:07:12.020 --> 00:07:15.100 
create your own theory leads but
chemtrails<00:07:13.020> because<00:07:13.440> causes<00:07:14.310> a<00:07:14.340> lot<00:07:14.730> of

00:07:15.100 --> 00:07:15.110 
chemtrails because causes a lot of

00:07:15.110 --> 00:07:19.220 
chemtrails because causes a lot of
positive<00:07:16.110> ions<00:07:16.560> you<00:07:17.340> know<00:07:17.460> because<00:07:18.140> you<00:07:19.140> know

00:07:19.220 --> 00:07:19.230 
positive ions you know because you know

00:07:19.230 --> 00:07:21.740 
positive ions you know because you know
the<00:07:19.380> cavity<00:07:19.710> son<00:07:19.950> is<00:07:20.280> cloudy<00:07:20.910> it's<00:07:21.420> not<00:07:21.570> from

00:07:21.740 --> 00:07:21.750 
the cavity son is cloudy it's not from

00:07:21.750 --> 00:07:24.380 
the cavity son is cloudy it's not from
the<00:07:21.870> other<00:07:22.080> reason<00:07:22.470> but<00:07:23.130> because<00:07:23.550> clouds<00:07:24.030> if

00:07:24.380 --> 00:07:24.390 
the other reason but because clouds if

00:07:24.390 --> 00:07:26.050 
the other reason but because clouds if
you<00:07:24.510> have<00:07:24.630> cloudy<00:07:24.900> cloudy<00:07:25.290> cloudy<00:07:25.620> days

00:07:26.050 --> 00:07:26.060 
you have cloudy cloudy cloudy days

00:07:26.060 --> 00:07:28.370 
you have cloudy cloudy cloudy days
you're<00:07:27.060> going<00:07:27.300> to<00:07:27.390> have<00:07:27.510> too<00:07:27.690> many<00:07:27.810> positive

00:07:28.370 --> 00:07:28.380 
you're going to have too many positive

00:07:28.380 --> 00:07:30.950 
you're going to have too many positive
ions<00:07:28.770> just<00:07:29.310> like<00:07:29.490> people<00:07:29.850> who<00:07:30.000> live<00:07:30.180> in<00:07:30.450> areas

00:07:30.950 --> 00:07:30.960 
ions just like people who live in areas

00:07:30.960 --> 00:07:33.200 
ions just like people who live in areas
like<00:07:31.200> maybe<00:07:31.530> North<00:07:31.920> Pole<00:07:32.220> for<00:07:32.610> South<00:07:32.850> Pole<00:07:33.120> I

00:07:33.200 --> 00:07:33.210 
like maybe North Pole for South Pole I

00:07:33.210 --> 00:07:34.640 
like maybe North Pole for South Pole I
don't<00:07:33.390> know<00:07:33.450> I<00:07:33.630> never<00:07:33.750> never<00:07:34.050> been<00:07:34.260> there<00:07:34.440> but

00:07:34.640 --> 00:07:34.650 
don't know I never never been there but

00:07:34.650 --> 00:07:37.640 
don't know I never never been there but
I<00:07:34.940> believe<00:07:35.940> they<00:07:36.060> use<00:07:36.240> lamps<00:07:36.690> in<00:07:36.810> there<00:07:37.020> but

00:07:37.640 --> 00:07:37.650 
I believe they use lamps in there but

00:07:37.650 --> 00:07:40.100 
I believe they use lamps in there but
they<00:07:37.770> usually<00:07:37.920> the<00:07:38.790> Western<00:07:39.240> ones<00:07:39.390> they<00:07:39.900> don't

00:07:40.100 --> 00:07:40.110 
they usually the Western ones they don't

00:07:40.110 --> 00:07:43.880 
they usually the Western ones they don't
use<00:07:40.650> that<00:07:41.040> I<00:07:41.280> know<00:07:42.260> who<00:07:43.260> knows<00:07:43.410> now<00:07:43.650> there's

00:07:43.880 --> 00:07:43.890 
use that I know who knows now there's

00:07:43.890 --> 00:07:47.720 
use that I know who knows now there's
the<00:07:44.010> paulino<00:07:44.460> but<00:07:46.040> they<00:07:47.040> have<00:07:47.220> to<00:07:47.370> use<00:07:47.520> those

00:07:47.720 --> 00:07:47.730 
the paulino but they have to use those

00:07:47.730 --> 00:07:50.690 
the paulino but they have to use those
lights<00:07:48.630> lamps<00:07:49.530> because<00:07:50.130> otherwise<00:07:50.550> people

00:07:50.690 --> 00:07:50.700 
lights lamps because otherwise people
