00:00:00.500 --> 00:00:05.839
 hello I spent a week since I 

00:00:03.320 --> 00:00:07.879
 they put the brackets and it can be good 

00:00:05.839 --> 00:00:10.760
 that has been improving to speak for 

00:00:07.879 --> 00:00:12.349
 eat I can eat practically from 

00:00:10.760 --> 00:00:14.990
 everything I want that does not cause me 

00:00:12.349 --> 00:00:18.320
 problems themselves are very good and if 

00:00:14.990 --> 00:00:20.090
 well it hurts a bit when I bite 

00:00:18.320 --> 00:00:22.910
 the front teeth that 's where 

00:00:20.090 --> 00:00:24.920
 We are working mainly from 

00:00:22.910 --> 00:00:27.349
 all ways already bearable clear no 

00:00:24.920 --> 00:00:28.849
 I can bite very hard things in the part 

00:00:27.349 --> 00:00:31.220
 with the front of the mouth has 

00:00:28.849 --> 00:00:33.140
 that cut it and send it the molars 

00:00:31.220 --> 00:00:35.250
 directly people who can bite 

00:00:33.140 --> 00:00:39.720
 of all 

00:00:35.250 --> 00:00:42.989
 when they started cutting 

00:00:39.720 --> 00:00:44.880
 a little bit inside the mouth I thought 

00:00:42.989 --> 00:00:47.250
 that he was going to have to buy the wax not 

00:00:44.880 --> 00:00:49.590
 is used so you do not get rationed 

00:00:47.250 --> 00:00:51.870
 inside but after a few days it's like 

00:00:49.590 --> 00:00:54.870
 that my mouth got used to them because 

00:00:51.870 --> 00:00:56.970
 the command hurts me no longer open this 

00:00:54.870 --> 00:00:59.309
 with this the little hook he has in this 

00:00:56.970 --> 00:01:01.800
 part but man took off the pain 

00:00:59.309 --> 00:01:05.040
 then I 'm not going to buy that sidewalk or 

00:01:01.800 --> 00:01:07.110
 at least not for the moment that more 

00:01:05.040 --> 00:01:10.070
 Well, one week we can see that 

00:01:07.110 --> 00:01:10.070
 still not much difference 

00:01:15.549 --> 00:01:21.909
 the lighting here does not help me much 

00:01:18.439 --> 00:01:24.020
 I look like a spectrum I'm outside 

00:01:21.909 --> 00:01:25.909
 practically then the light hits me 

00:01:24.020 --> 00:01:27.890
 of the sun whether or directly it seems 

00:01:25.909 --> 00:01:30.730
 which is enough to make me look pale 

00:01:27.890 --> 00:01:33.090
 like the twilight 

00:01:30.730 --> 00:01:35.219
 good 

00:01:33.090 --> 00:01:38.219
 at this moment it almost does not cause me pain 

00:01:35.219 --> 00:01:40.909
 teeth not all discomfort 

00:01:38.219 --> 00:01:43.130
 mainly here 

00:01:40.909 --> 00:01:44.899
 things or flossing like that 

00:01:43.130 --> 00:01:46.249
 they are hard pressed dayz teeth 

00:01:44.899 --> 00:01:48.070
 with a lot of pressure if I want to pass the 

00:01:46.249 --> 00:01:51.880
 floss over there 

00:01:48.070 --> 00:01:54.130
 can not I be all right is not so 

00:01:51.880 --> 00:01:57.760
 complicated as I thought you are interested in 

00:01:54.130 --> 00:02:01.630
 brackets I say it's true it will be more 

00:01:57.760 --> 00:02:05.130
 food but actually even if you have the 

00:02:01.630 --> 00:02:07.200
 normal brush the brush 

00:02:05.130 --> 00:02:10.349
 special that is for the imposing the 

00:02:07.200 --> 00:02:12.300
 brackets and regular floss with 

00:02:10.349 --> 00:02:14.040
 that's enough you can actually 

00:02:12.300 --> 00:02:16.739
 accustom to clean relatively 

00:02:14.040 --> 00:02:19.290
 fast clear it's never going to be that fast 

00:02:16.739 --> 00:02:22.110
 as if you were not there but if it is 

00:02:19.290 --> 00:02:25.040
 possible and it's not a big problem good 

00:02:22.110 --> 00:02:27.510
 this was week 1 with me now that 

00:02:25.040 --> 00:02:31.530
 I have the worry that the 

00:02:27.510 --> 00:02:34.650
 record or files go to 

00:02:31.530 --> 00:02:37.799
 climb instead of these fangs 

00:02:34.650 --> 00:02:40.200
 cute get off but good for now 

00:02:37.799 --> 00:02:42.930
 again I see difference I do not see that they do not rise 

00:02:40.200 --> 00:02:45.150
 I do not see others downloading them and seeing how 

00:02:42.930 --> 00:02:47.420
 we go week 1 is all 

00:02:45.150 --> 00:02:47.420
 bye bye
