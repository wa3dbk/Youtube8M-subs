00:00:23.240 --> 00:00:23.250 
makes sense I I don't I don't know what

00:00:23.250 --> 00:00:28.310 
makes sense I I don't I don't know what
to<00:00:23.400> make<00:00:23.430> of<00:00:23.609> this<00:00:25.070> basically<00:00:26.070> finite<00:00:27.320> Zeus

00:00:28.310 --> 00:00:28.320 
to make of this basically finite Zeus

00:00:28.320 --> 00:00:31.220 
to make of this basically finite Zeus
character<00:00:29.099> that<00:00:29.550> that<00:00:29.880> would<00:00:30.000> emerge<00:00:30.359> now

00:00:31.220 --> 00:00:31.230 
character that that would emerge now

00:00:31.230 --> 00:00:32.630 
character that that would emerge now
that's<00:00:31.410> not<00:00:31.619> I<00:00:31.650> mean<00:00:31.679> I<00:00:31.830> don't<00:00:32.070> say<00:00:32.219> it<00:00:32.430> because

00:00:32.630 --> 00:00:32.640 
that's not I mean I don't say it because

00:00:32.640 --> 00:00:34.160 
that's not I mean I don't say it because
of<00:00:32.969> course<00:00:33.090> he<00:00:33.270> doesn't<00:00:33.420> have<00:00:33.630> the<00:00:33.719> character

00:00:34.160 --> 00:00:34.170 
of course he doesn't have the character

00:00:34.170 --> 00:00:36.260 
of course he doesn't have the character
of<00:00:34.200> Zeus<00:00:34.559> he<00:00:34.680> has<00:00:34.770> the<00:00:34.920> character<00:00:35.309> of<00:00:35.460> one<00:00:36.149> who

00:00:36.260 --> 00:00:36.270 
of Zeus he has the character of one who

00:00:36.270 --> 00:00:38.060 
of Zeus he has the character of one who
would<00:00:36.390> die<00:00:36.600> for<00:00:36.660> those<00:00:37.140> he<00:00:37.320> loves<00:00:37.500> or<00:00:37.739> not<00:00:37.890> I

00:00:38.060 --> 00:00:38.070 
would die for those he loves or not I

00:00:38.070 --> 00:00:40.000 
would die for those he loves or not I
don't<00:00:38.280> I<00:00:38.399> don't<00:00:38.460> mean<00:00:38.670> to<00:00:38.790> I'm<00:00:39.239> not<00:00:39.420> trying<00:00:39.780> to

00:00:40.000 --> 00:00:40.010 
don't I don't mean to I'm not trying to

00:00:40.010 --> 00:00:42.410 
don't I don't mean to I'm not trying to
mock<00:00:41.010> William<00:00:41.460> Lane<00:00:41.640> Craig<00:00:41.670> I'm<00:00:42.059> just<00:00:42.239> saying

00:00:42.410 --> 00:00:42.420 
mock William Lane Craig I'm just saying

00:00:42.420 --> 00:00:44.900 
mock William Lane Craig I'm just saying
that<00:00:42.600> that's<00:00:43.350> the<00:00:43.649> problem<00:00:43.920> is<00:00:44.250> I<00:00:44.280> can't

00:00:44.900 --> 00:00:44.910 
that that's the problem is I can't

00:00:44.910 --> 00:00:48.020 
that that's the problem is I can't
really<00:00:45.000> ally<00:00:45.390> myself<00:00:46.020> with<00:00:46.860> it<00:00:47.039> because<00:00:47.190> it<00:00:47.579> I

00:00:48.020 --> 00:00:48.030 
really ally myself with it because it I

00:00:48.030 --> 00:00:50.479 
really ally myself with it because it I
think<00:00:48.750> Craig<00:00:49.200> is<00:00:49.260> bet<00:00:49.739> if<00:00:49.890> he<00:00:49.920> isn't<00:00:50.100> if<00:00:50.399> you

00:00:50.479 --> 00:00:50.489 
think Craig is bet if he isn't if you

00:00:50.489 --> 00:00:51.950 
think Craig is bet if he isn't if you
ever<00:00:50.610> had<00:00:50.820> that<00:00:50.850> debate<00:00:51.210> with<00:00:51.390> Dawkins<00:00:51.840> the

00:00:51.950 --> 00:00:51.960 
ever had that debate with Dawkins the

00:00:51.960 --> 00:00:54.290 
ever had that debate with Dawkins the
Dawkins<00:00:52.170> won't<00:00:52.590> have<00:00:52.879> and<00:00:53.879> we<00:00:54.030> know<00:00:54.149> why

00:00:54.290 --> 00:00:54.300 
Dawkins won't have and we know why

00:00:54.300 --> 00:00:56.180 
Dawkins won't have and we know why
Dawkins<00:00:54.719> won't<00:00:54.870> have<00:00:55.020> it<00:00:55.170> because<00:00:55.469> he<00:00:55.739> is<00:00:56.070> not

00:00:56.180 --> 00:00:56.190 
Dawkins won't have it because he is not

00:00:56.190 --> 00:00:58.910 
Dawkins won't have it because he is not
a<00:00:56.460> philosopher<00:00:57.210> and<00:00:57.420> he<00:00:58.109> knows<00:00:58.289> he<00:00:58.440> would<00:00:58.770> look

00:00:58.910 --> 00:00:58.920 
a philosopher and he knows he would look

00:00:58.920 --> 00:01:01.939 
a philosopher and he knows he would look
bad<00:00:59.190> but<00:00:59.670> he<00:00:59.789> can<00:01:00.149> come<00:01:00.329> up<00:01:00.480> with<00:01:00.510> good<00:01:00.949> excuses

00:01:01.939 --> 00:01:01.949 
bad but he can come up with good excuses

00:01:01.949 --> 00:01:04.520 
bad but he can come up with good excuses
but<00:01:02.670> the<00:01:02.820> rebut<00:01:03.390> but<00:01:03.539> if<00:01:03.629> you<00:01:03.719> had<00:01:03.870> the<00:01:04.019> debate

00:01:04.520 --> 00:01:04.530 
but the rebut but if you had the debate

00:01:04.530 --> 00:01:10.070 
but the rebut but if you had the debate
I<00:01:04.559> would<00:01:05.010> prefer<00:01:06.619> the<00:01:07.619> believer<00:01:07.979> in<00:01:08.400> I<00:01:09.180> suppose

00:01:10.070 --> 00:01:10.080 
I would prefer the believer in I suppose

00:01:10.080 --> 00:01:13.190 
I would prefer the believer in I suppose
I<00:01:10.830> don't<00:01:11.820> even<00:01:12.000> know<00:01:12.180> if<00:01:12.210> that's<00:01:12.360> true<00:01:12.720> to<00:01:13.080> be

00:01:13.190 --> 00:01:13.200 
I don't even know if that's true to be

00:01:13.200 --> 00:01:15.859 
I don't even know if that's true to be
honest<00:01:13.560> because<00:01:13.850> when<00:01:14.850> Dawkins<00:01:15.299> refused<00:01:15.750> to

00:01:15.859 --> 00:01:15.869 
honest because when Dawkins refused to

00:01:15.869 --> 00:01:18.590 
honest because when Dawkins refused to
debate<00:01:15.990> Craig<00:01:16.470> he<00:01:17.400> pointed<00:01:17.790> to<00:01:17.939> an<00:01:18.060> exegesis

00:01:18.590 --> 00:01:18.600 
debate Craig he pointed to an exegesis

00:01:18.600 --> 00:01:21.140 
debate Craig he pointed to an exegesis

Testament<00:01:21.750> passage<00:01:22.680> with<00:01:23.220> which<00:01:23.369> I<00:01:23.490> found

00:01:23.660 --> 00:01:23.670 
Testament passage with which I found

00:01:23.670 --> 00:01:25.340 
Testament passage with which I found
myself<00:01:23.820> agreeing<00:01:24.299> with<00:01:24.450> Dawkins<00:01:24.930> entirely

00:01:25.340 --> 00:01:25.350 
myself agreeing with Dawkins entirely

00:01:25.350 --> 00:01:28.520 
myself agreeing with Dawkins entirely
that<00:01:25.740> the<00:01:26.130> crudity<00:01:26.520> of<00:01:26.960> the<00:01:27.960> argument<00:01:28.380> being

00:01:28.520 --> 00:01:28.530 
that the crudity of the argument being

00:01:28.530 --> 00:01:31.359 
that the crudity of the argument being
made<00:01:28.740> by<00:01:28.920> William<00:01:29.100> Lane<00:01:29.430> Craig<00:01:29.570> was<00:01:30.570> morally

00:01:31.359 --> 00:01:31.369 
made by William Lane Craig was morally

00:01:31.369 --> 00:01:34.190 
made by William Lane Craig was morally
really<00:01:32.369> offensive<00:01:32.700> so<00:01:33.689> I<00:01:33.720> don't<00:01:33.930> even<00:01:33.990> know<00:01:34.170> if

00:01:34.190 --> 00:01:34.200 
really offensive so I don't even know if

00:01:34.200 --> 00:01:36.499 
really offensive so I don't even know if
it<00:01:34.350> agree<00:01:34.530> that<00:01:34.740> so<00:01:35.310> that<00:01:35.490> that's<00:01:35.820> the<00:01:36.060> that's

00:01:36.499 --> 00:01:36.509 
it agree that so that that's the that's

00:01:36.509 --> 00:01:37.969 
it agree that so that that's the that's
