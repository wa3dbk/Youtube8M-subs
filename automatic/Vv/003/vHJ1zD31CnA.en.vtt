 hello youtube friends welcome to 

00:00:15.010 --> 00:00:19.120
 this video tutorial on how to install a 

00:00:17.080 --> 00:00:21.010
 theme in windows 7 starter that like 

00:00:19.120 --> 00:00:23.110
 you know in this version I do not know 

00:00:21.010 --> 00:00:25.360
 can really good what we're going to 

00:00:23.110 --> 00:00:27.550
 to do is to patch our windows with a 

00:00:25.360 --> 00:00:29.680
 program that is called personalized the 

00:00:27.550 --> 00:00:32.050
 download link of the program is in the 

00:00:29.680 --> 00:00:33.730
 description of the video let's start at 

00:00:32.050 --> 00:00:36.190
 have downloaded the program that 

00:00:33.730 --> 00:00:38.530
 approximately weighs 4 megabytes 

00:00:36.190 --> 00:00:40.630
 a zip file like this we give to 

00:00:38.530 --> 00:00:42.460
 extract here after extracting them 

00:00:40.630 --> 00:00:44.590
 there will be a folder called patch and 

00:00:42.460 --> 00:00:46.870
 this contains the application that we are going to 

00:00:44.590 --> 00:00:49.210
 use the open and we will appear two 

00:00:46.870 --> 00:00:51.250
 files and a good folder I'm not going to 

00:00:49.210 --> 00:00:53.260
 install the application because I already 

00:00:51.250 --> 00:00:55.180
 had done but in the folder comes a 

00:00:53.260 --> 00:00:57.039
 text document where the 

00:00:55.180 --> 00:00:59.079
 instructions read the why because 

00:00:57.039 --> 00:01:01.269
 badly installed this program can cast 

00:00:59.079 --> 00:01:03.609
 to lose your operating system to have 

00:01:01.269 --> 00:01:05.890
 installed the program will be restarted 

00:01:03.609 --> 00:01:07.990
 the pc this is normal do not get scared and if 

00:01:05.890 --> 00:01:10.120
 it does not restart it they have to restart 

00:01:07.990 --> 00:01:11.980
 so that the program works good as 

00:01:10.120 --> 00:01:13.990
 you see, I have the version of 

00:01:11.980 --> 00:01:16.420
 windows seven starter and in this version 

00:01:13.990 --> 00:01:18.220
 it is not allowed to install themes to see 

00:01:16.420 --> 00:01:18.970
 the changes that the program made in 

00:01:18.220 --> 00:01:20.620
 our system 

00:01:18.970 --> 00:01:23.110
 we have to right click on 

00:01:20.620 --> 00:01:25.240
 good desk as you see us 

00:01:23.110 --> 00:01:27.580
 the option to customize appears and this 

00:01:25.240 --> 00:01:29.500
 it did not appear before that means 

00:01:27.580 --> 00:01:30.910
 that our system is already patched 

00:01:29.500 --> 00:01:33.220
 we double click on the option 

00:01:30.910 --> 00:01:35.200
 customize to open it good and to 

00:01:33.220 --> 00:01:36.940
 open it we see a window and in 

00:01:35.200 --> 00:01:38.890
 this one looks at all the issues that 

00:01:36.940 --> 00:01:40.870
 we have but in your case it is the first 

00:01:38.890 --> 00:01:42.700
 once they use the program and when 

00:01:40.870 --> 00:01:44.650
 that you select a theme for 

00:01:42.700 --> 00:01:46.870
 install it may be that the PC will be 

00:01:44.650 --> 00:01:49.470
 reboot again and if it does not restart not 

00:01:46.870 --> 00:01:51.960
 it is necessary to restart the 

00:01:49.470 --> 00:01:54.000
 As you see, I changed the subject of 

00:01:51.960 --> 00:01:56.310
 my pc and now you can install several 

00:01:54.000 --> 00:01:58.530
 issues to your pc good actually now 

00:01:56.310 --> 00:02:00.660
 just worry about looking for good topics 

00:01:58.530 --> 00:02:02.670
 and that your desktop is seen to the maximum and 

00:02:00.660 --> 00:02:04.980
 actually while windows is 

00:02:02.670 --> 00:02:07.170
 patched we can install themes change 

00:02:04.980 --> 00:02:09.720
 the cursor the wallpaper and many 

00:02:07.170 --> 00:02:11.820
 things more without having to download and 

00:02:09.720 --> 00:02:13.830
 install fucking programs that only occupy 

00:02:11.820 --> 00:02:15.870
 good memory as they come and I changed the 

00:02:13.830 --> 00:02:18.420
 wallpaper and transparent the 

00:02:15.870 --> 00:02:20.160
 taskbar good friends that's it
