00:00:07.189 --> 00:00:12.840
 we all have to lie and cheat 

00:00:10.010 --> 00:00:16.080
 in this society to succeed because 

00:00:12.840 --> 00:00:17.820
 that she does not accept nor the truth actually 

00:00:16.080 --> 00:00:20.760
 she does not really understand the true 

00:00:17.820 --> 00:00:22.350
 so we have to distort the situation a bit 

00:00:20.760 --> 00:00:24.180
 truth is that I cheated on 

00:00:22.350 --> 00:00:25.590
 many a lot of points a lot like 

00:00:24.180 --> 00:00:27.000
 everyone is franÃ§ois 

00:00:25.590 --> 00:00:32.759
 holland is a very big nervous and 

00:00:27.000 --> 00:00:33.840
 break all over there to the possible elysÃ©e I 

00:00:32.759 --> 00:00:37.380
 am told it's still more 

00:00:33.840 --> 00:00:40.590
 interesting to go through the humor and 

00:00:37.380 --> 00:00:43.200
 people are going to watch laughter talking 

00:00:40.590 --> 00:00:47.579
 of what we want from the conjuncture of the 

00:00:43.200 --> 00:00:49.469
 crisis the war in geopolitics h1 and 

00:00:47.579 --> 00:00:51.690
 a look in fact he laughs it's 

00:00:49.469 --> 00:00:53.670
 the whole picture is this one it's great 

00:00:51.690 --> 00:00:55.559
 with that we can do something and 

00:00:53.670 --> 00:00:57.989
 I was sticking it as much as possible to my 

00:00:55.559 --> 00:00:59.070
 because it's him who has a 

00:00:57.989 --> 00:01:01.500
 form of truth 

00:00:59.070 --> 00:01:03.210
 in reality and when I saw them I 

00:01:01.500 --> 00:01:04.890
 saw my horns I said but it's me 

00:01:03.210 --> 00:01:09.090
 it's good to be like 

00:01:04.890 --> 00:01:13.670
 that in life sometimes be a little silly 

00:01:09.090 --> 00:01:16.830
 sometimes a little crazy a little elsewhere 

00:01:13.670 --> 00:01:20.369
 it sticks it is found more true than me 

00:01:16.830 --> 00:01:25.430
 even more affordable but the superb 

00:01:20.369 --> 00:01:25.430
 this one is sexy doc the fairground 

00:01:25.720 --> 00:01:32.260
 ah bah me i was born here in the 

00:01:28.510 --> 00:01:35.500
 not finished khagne and hypokhagne by not having 

00:01:32.260 --> 00:01:38.440
 not read all the novels he 

00:01:35.500 --> 00:01:40.630
 I had to understand how me in 

00:01:38.440 --> 00:01:42.430
 my texts were alive in my 

00:01:40.630 --> 00:01:43.840
 work in my words and in my 

00:01:42.430 --> 00:01:45.640
 sentences there was something alive 

00:01:43.840 --> 00:01:48.610
 so every time they are in the process of 

00:01:45.640 --> 00:01:51.160
 ask yourself questions about how 

00:01:48.610 --> 00:01:53.110
 I will be legitimate in my work 

00:01:51.160 --> 00:01:56.260
 writing is what I have the right 

00:01:53.110 --> 00:01:58.360
 to write I'm lucky to have some 

00:01:56.260 --> 00:02:00.700
 can do sentences that live and 

00:01:58.360 --> 00:02:02.940
 to say words alive so it's not 

00:02:00.700 --> 00:02:02.940
 wrong 

00:02:06.080 --> 00:02:11.720
 I regret it but total business 

00:02:09.399 --> 00:02:15.500
 to recognize it was for me too a 

00:02:11.720 --> 00:02:16.630
 way of life of someone coming out of 

00:02:15.500 --> 00:02:19.550
 door of the chapel 

00:02:16.630 --> 00:02:23.090
 if the mouth had called me before it's 

00:02:19.550 --> 00:02:26.360
 sure I would have been part of that too 

00:02:23.090 --> 00:02:27.920
 party that is very criticize the right 

00:02:26.360 --> 00:02:30.680
 but I just had the intelligence 

00:02:27.920 --> 00:02:33.350
 political not to join one end 

00:02:30.680 --> 00:02:37.520
 it's gone there years like that between 

00:02:33.350 --> 00:02:40.130
 two it's fake parties who came back who 

00:02:37.520 --> 00:02:41.840
 play the game with the media too 

00:02:40.130 --> 00:02:43.460
 often that's why we got it 

00:02:41.840 --> 00:02:45.470
 do wrong some steps on 

00:02:43.460 --> 00:02:47.600
 communicated much more than we 

00:02:45.470 --> 00:02:51.280
 saw and I believe that if we wake up 

00:02:47.600 --> 00:02:54.680
 we would have communicated - but of course 

00:02:51.280 --> 00:02:56.570
 say like the sea â€‹â€‹no weight when 

00:02:54.680 --> 00:02:59.209
 you when he listens he has ten hyper 

00:02:56.570 --> 00:03:01.670
 advised at the time giddy thing true 

00:02:59.209 --> 00:03:03.590
 but you must have had your ear 

00:03:01.670 --> 00:03:04.600
 listen to someone like me like you 

00:03:03.590 --> 00:03:08.770
 the music 

00:03:04.600 --> 00:03:08.770
 ea sports this can help you 

00:03:10.819 --> 00:03:17.069
 me about anti-Semitism and its rise in 

00:03:13.739 --> 00:03:20.340
 europe we know it's always the same 

00:03:17.069 --> 00:03:21.180
 this is one of the moments of crisis 

00:03:20.340 --> 00:03:23.640
 like this 

00:03:21.180 --> 00:03:27.060
 do not eat a lot at school but 

00:03:23.640 --> 00:03:29.430
 well we know it goes up to dar in 

00:03:27.060 --> 00:03:31.620
 moments like that is going there are a lot of 

00:03:29.430 --> 00:03:33.450
 unemployment where it's not going well for him 

00:03:31.620 --> 00:03:35.819
 speak directly I find that it's 

00:03:33.450 --> 00:03:39.380
 still quite grotesque it's when 

00:03:35.819 --> 00:03:42.900
 even an error like that to play with 

00:03:39.380 --> 00:03:45.060
 that to his millions of deaths even as 

00:03:42.900 --> 00:03:47.910
 that humorous even if people finesse 

00:03:45.060 --> 00:03:50.430
 where the intelligence to understand who 

00:03:47.910 --> 00:03:52.200
 it's a game I think it's still 

00:03:50.430 --> 00:03:53.940
 still serious the Jewish people 

00:03:52.200 --> 00:03:55.440
 coming from someone of color too 

00:03:53.940 --> 00:03:57.540
 it's pretty strange 

00:03:55.440 --> 00:04:01.380
 he will end up telling us that it was a 

00:03:57.540 --> 00:04:02.430
 game will come out like that because I 

00:04:01.380 --> 00:04:04.590
 do not think he wants to die 

00:04:02.430 --> 00:04:07.440
 that we will do a pirouette like all 

00:04:04.590 --> 00:04:10.140
 the artists will explain that it is a 

00:04:07.440 --> 00:04:11.940
 game but I think there are things 

00:04:10.140 --> 00:04:17.910
 with which we must not play for 

00:04:11.940 --> 00:04:19.590
 me it's really here it's me for me 

00:04:17.910 --> 00:04:21.299
 it's me it hurt me at school 

00:04:19.590 --> 00:04:23.580
 really it was a shock to me 

00:04:21.299 --> 00:04:25.710
 the images of the camps and his trunks in 

00:04:23.580 --> 00:04:28.560
 two according to a really point of view 

00:04:25.710 --> 00:04:30.510
 general and all we need the people 

00:04:28.560 --> 00:04:32.780
 jew i think this world he needs 

00:04:30.510 --> 00:04:36.530
 the Jewish people because it really 

00:04:32.780 --> 00:04:36.530
 it's a real story 

00:04:39.190 --> 00:04:43.690
 they say privacy and public life 

00:04:41.920 --> 00:04:46.720
 but now you can not dissociate 

00:04:43.690 --> 00:04:46.990
 both must be crazy to think 

00:04:46.720 --> 00:04:50.080
 it 

00:04:46.990 --> 00:04:52.690
 someone who has problems with this 

00:04:50.080 --> 00:04:54.520
 kind there in his private life but it takes 

00:04:52.690 --> 00:04:56.650
 have a power already on his private life 

00:04:54.520 --> 00:04:58.750
 when you go after saying I have ideas 

00:04:56.650 --> 00:05:01.330
 for family life I have ideas 

00:04:58.750 --> 00:05:04.170
 for the other people will ask themselves 

00:05:01.330 --> 00:05:07.770
 questions here is no need for headphones 

00:05:04.170 --> 00:05:07.770
 I have my hat
