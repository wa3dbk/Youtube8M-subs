00:00:15.940 --> 00:00:21.430
 hi everyone I'm already 19 and this is another 

00:00:18.369 --> 00:00:22.990
 hd berg video is black this video 

00:00:21.430 --> 00:00:24.789
 it really is more of opinion and 

00:00:22.990 --> 00:00:27.340
 my perspective about what 

00:00:24.789 --> 00:00:29.169
 we could have hello 5 since we 

00:00:27.340 --> 00:00:31.570
 confirmed in the comic-con that people 

00:00:29.169 --> 00:00:34.600
 in what will be playable in geniuses 5 and that 

00:00:31.570 --> 00:00:36.640
 milestone iphone be in installation 04 in 

00:00:34.600 --> 00:00:39.670
 other words in hello that the boss 

00:00:36.640 --> 00:00:40.960
 master destroyed in combative halo and 

00:00:39.670 --> 00:00:42.420
 I have the odd comment that 

00:00:40.960 --> 00:00:44.980
 I would like to share with all of you 

00:00:42.420 --> 00:00:46.989
 first of all thanks to a comment 

00:00:44.980 --> 00:00:48.940
 that he made blood metal he may have 

00:00:46.989 --> 00:00:51.219
 a fight against the surviving flow 

00:00:48.940 --> 00:00:53.829
 of the halo destroyed and that people 

00:00:51.219 --> 00:00:55.989
 next to his squad they will have to fight 

00:00:53.829 --> 00:00:58.690
 for his life in a conflict between the 

00:00:55.989 --> 00:01:00.670
 four and the five guardians I think 

00:00:58.690 --> 00:01:02.289
 something interesting because maybe it explains 

00:01:00.670 --> 00:01:04.360
 to the character as someone extremely 

00:01:02.289 --> 00:01:06.850
 able to overcome any other 

00:01:04.360 --> 00:01:08.920
 sparta in generation 4 and besides being 

00:01:06.850 --> 00:01:10.900
 a good partner or adversary when you 

00:01:08.920 --> 00:01:12.729
 is about the master boss already with the 

00:01:10.900 --> 00:01:14.740
 confirmation that the log will be playable 

00:01:12.729 --> 00:01:17.020
 we can have an idea that the 

00:01:14.740 --> 00:01:18.850
 campaign will be halo 2 or halo 3 style 

00:01:17.020 --> 00:01:21.610
 we may play a part of 

00:01:18.850 --> 00:01:24.100
 the campaign being the blog and let's see everything 

00:01:21.610 --> 00:01:25.780
 perspective or maybe it's just a 

00:01:24.100 --> 00:01:28.270
 fellow traveling with the master boss 

00:01:25.780 --> 00:01:30.430
 from my point of view you have someone 

00:01:28.270 --> 00:01:32.710
 that accompanies the master boss could be 

00:01:30.430 --> 00:01:34.660
 someone rude or very cool like the 

00:01:32.710 --> 00:01:36.580
 inquisitor or it would simply be one of 

00:01:34.660 --> 00:01:38.920
 those elites that nobody knows in him or three 

00:01:36.580 --> 00:01:40.060
 according to the actor of hello night fall that 

00:01:38.920 --> 00:01:41.740
 he plays the role of loc 

00:01:40.060 --> 00:01:44.020
 in an interview he explains that the 

00:01:41.740 --> 00:01:46.270
 character is someone who has a voice is a 

00:01:44.020 --> 00:01:48.100
 born leader who can think one step 

00:01:46.270 --> 00:01:50.110
 before the enemy and who it is a 

00:01:48.100 --> 00:01:51.850
 thinker someone who has a voice 

00:01:50.110 --> 00:01:54.310
 important about your team and who knows what 

00:01:51.850 --> 00:01:56.290
 what exactly does he do against the enemy and 

00:01:54.310 --> 00:01:58.600
 like every leader is someone who gives 

00:01:56.290 --> 00:02:00.430
 encouragement in your team and that always thinks 

00:01:58.600 --> 00:02:02.440
 before doing things reminds me 

00:02:00.430 --> 00:02:04.840
 quite other leaders like for example 

00:02:02.440 --> 00:02:06.490
 the master chief with the blue team does not 

00:02:04.840 --> 00:02:07.930
 I say that they are of the same caliber that 

00:02:06.490 --> 00:02:10.000
 implies that it is something interesting that the 

00:02:07.930 --> 00:02:12.790
 character is like that from my point of 

00:02:10.000 --> 00:02:15.340
 vista industries 343 is pushing this 

00:02:12.790 --> 00:02:17.080
 character and makes us understand what will be 

00:02:15.340 --> 00:02:19.870
 important in the journey of the master chief 

00:02:17.080 --> 00:02:22.600
 and in the halo universe now because 

00:02:19.870 --> 00:02:24.580
 will be looking for the master boss me that 

00:02:22.600 --> 00:02:26.350
 It will be known soon but as I understand it 

00:02:24.580 --> 00:02:28.170
 Once there is a new virus a new element 

00:02:26.350 --> 00:02:30.840
 that kills humans 

00:02:28.170 --> 00:02:32.640
 typically humans and nothing else but 

00:02:30.840 --> 00:02:34.319
 that kind of theories I leave others 

00:02:32.640 --> 00:02:36.569
 youtube channels since I would like 

00:02:34.319 --> 00:02:39.569
 talk about the return of the flow in the place 

00:02:36.569 --> 00:02:41.849
 that leave something that honestly always 

00:02:39.569 --> 00:02:44.520
 I have opined is a style shooting if I 3 

00:02:41.849 --> 00:02:46.980
 odst but with more species and for 

00:02:44.520 --> 00:02:49.319
 course more difficult I'm not a fan of 

00:02:46.980 --> 00:02:51.480
 Halo reach shooting is very easy to 

00:02:49.319 --> 00:02:53.190
 play it and in a certain way it does not feel 

00:02:51.480 --> 00:02:56.100
 well when one wins a set of enemies 

00:02:53.190 --> 00:02:58.440
 on the other hand in halo 5 we have the 

00:02:56.100 --> 00:03:01.350
 potential to have a shooting with all 

00:02:58.440 --> 00:03:03.090
 the factions or sparta species are 

00:03:01.350 --> 00:03:04.800
 they escape from the authority of the unesa 

00:03:03.090 --> 00:03:07.410
 wong and they have to face off 

00:03:04.800 --> 00:03:10.860
 UN experts will eat remnants for 

00:03:07.410 --> 00:03:13.170
 owners of lots is I would honestly call 

00:03:10.860 --> 00:03:15.630
 quite the attention and would add a little 

00:03:13.170 --> 00:03:17.280
 of variety to the game mode from my 

00:03:15.630 --> 00:03:18.870
 point of view with the information that 

00:03:17.280 --> 00:03:20.610
 we have of milestone iphone 

00:03:18.870 --> 00:03:22.709
 the return of the fleet is closer than 

00:03:20.610 --> 00:03:24.840
 never and game modes that include 

00:03:22.709 --> 00:03:26.940
 all species like shooting would be 

00:03:24.840 --> 00:03:29.010
 an excellent opportunity for the five 

00:03:26.940 --> 00:03:31.140
 and well guys I know this video is a 

00:03:29.010 --> 00:03:33.060
 little short and random but I hope that 

00:03:31.140 --> 00:03:35.010

00:03:33.060 --> 00:03:37.470
 video please leave your like and

00:03:37.470 --> 00:03:41.099
 you think of the return of the flow they want the 

00:03:39.420 --> 00:03:43.590
 flow back or you do not want those from 

00:03:41.099 --> 00:03:45.599
 come back and what do you think of the movie the 

00:03:43.590 --> 00:03:47.819
 hill an iphone what do you expect from the people 

00:03:45.599 --> 00:03:49.890
 crazy and what do you expect in the relationship of 

00:03:47.819 --> 00:03:52.140
