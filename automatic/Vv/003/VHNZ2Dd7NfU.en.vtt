00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:09.720
 This is a question from Agropass notebook 3336. And there are two parts of that question. 

00:00:09.720 --> 00:00:21.040
 First: Do I See Us Again Using Partial Silver Mice? You know the percentage of silver or gold in the coins. 

00:00:21.040 --> 00:00:24.940
 So a little precious metal in coins. 

00:00:24.940 --> 00:00:35.240
 Second: Do I see us go back to some currency that is covered with gold or silver in a vault, or partially covered? 

00:00:35.240 --> 00:00:39.560
 And, you know, the answer is I really don't know all this. 

00:00:39.560 --> 00:00:48.740
 I think that if the public learns enough about what's going on, there's really a possibility that we can go back to gold or gold and silver, to a bimetallic standard. 

00:00:48.740 --> 00:00:53.500
 But understand, the GOLDEN STANDARD IS NOTHING. It's a gold that is good. 

00:00:53.500 --> 00:01:04.740
 Gold standard: somebody will keep the gold in the vault and issue these receipts, which are gold vouchers, and tell you that it is fully payable. We have all the gold we said we have, we'll just print it. 

00:01:04.740 --> 00:01:21.480
 First, it is the national currency. It gives them control over the currency crossing the border, etc. If you use only gold ... If we simply used an ounce of silver and an ounce of gold and a fraction ounce, 1/10 ounce, grams of gold, anything. 

00:01:21.480 --> 00:01:29.880
 Then it's the same currency across the planet. No country can steal our wealth by pushing more. 

00:01:29.880 --> 00:01:36.460
 Once they make the gold standard, they control the inflow and outflow of capital across borders. 

00:01:36.460 --> 00:01:46.820
 they can confiscate the middle class wealth. Especially when they engage in war. They can turn on the tickers and tell you that it is redeemable and then cancel this right. 

00:01:46.820 --> 00:02:01.660
 Just as they did when World War I broke out. And they turned on printers and diluted your purchasing power, basically stealing your wealth and transferring it to government and the military and banking sector. 

00:02:01.660 --> 00:02:11.420
 So you know, it would be fanatical if we could go back to gold. We wouldn't have these bubbles, we would have slower but steady growth (development), our prosperity would be much bigger. 

00:02:11.420 --> 00:02:24.300
 You wouldn't have the banking sector and these world central banks, these leeches sucking blood out of the economy. So for this reason our maximum prosperity would be at a much higher level than it is today. 

00:02:24.300 --> 00:02:26.840
 If we didn't have all this. 

00:02:26.840 --> 00:02:29.640
 But: I think we will return to it (gold)? No. 

00:02:29.640 --> 00:02:36.760
 They try some scam like SDR, or try some new currency. 

00:02:36.760 --> 00:02:51.400
 You know, even if you have a precious-metal currency where they can print a little surplus currency like they did in the world wars, they had a "Gold Exchange Standard" and then a Bretton Woods standard after 1944. 

00:02:51.400 --> 00:03:02.040
 And these standards set a bit of constraint, but they were equally able to increase their money supply and also create a debt-based currency that we have today, coupled with gold. 

00:03:02.060 --> 00:03:19.560
 And when you have national currencies and gold standards, it gives governments the ability to cheat gold, and deceive a little more and cheat a little more until the whole thing falls apart. And it's their fault because they cheat this way. 

00:03:19.560 --> 00:03:24.140
 And it ends with causing a great dispute between people. 

00:03:24.140 --> 00:03:32.360
 So I really hope we won't have the gold standard. I would love to come back to just gold and silver. 

00:03:32.360 --> 00:03:48.020
 And you know, there's no reason you can't take gold or silver and put them in the safe. And take every gram or nanogram or anything you need to have enough units of currency for the planet. 

00:03:48.020 --> 00:03:52.440
 People say, "There's not enough gold." FUCK, there's plenty of gold. 

00:03:52.440 --> 00:03:58.440
 We could give each atom a serial number and in that case one ounce would be enough currency for the entire planet. 

00:03:58.440 --> 00:04:09.420
 And you can orbit them on a credit card and you simply transfer ownership. You go to the store to buy something, drive through the card and transfer those serial numbers from you to the store. 

00:04:09.420 --> 00:04:21.380
 So it would be so easy to get back to gold. We can use it in digital society, security and control, and balance (balances) to make sure they have the gold they say they have - that's very important. 

00:04:21.380 --> 00:04:32.740
 Why can't we control the Fed? Well, you know, that's another story. I will get to this next time. The Fed and the Treasury probably don't have gold, they say yes. 

00:04:32.740 --> 00:04:45.560
 Why can't we control them? This is a question I will answer in a separate video. 

00:04:45.560 --> 00:04:47.820
