that<00:01:24.479> these<00:01:24.720> are<00:01:25.100> rather<00:01:26.100> nice<00:01:26.430> reproductions

00:01:27.320 --> 00:01:27.330 
that these are rather nice reproductions

that these are rather nice reproductions
well<00:01:27.750> I<00:01:27.780> would<00:01:28.110> say<00:01:28.439> looking<00:01:29.130> at<00:01:29.280> them<00:01:29.430> is<00:01:29.610> that

00:01:29.749 --> 00:01:29.759 
well I would say looking at them is that

00:01:29.759 --> 00:01:32.420 
well I would say looking at them is that
the<00:01:29.970> the<00:01:30.509> back<00:01:31.049> graphics<00:01:31.650> are<00:01:31.829> slightly

00:01:32.420 --> 00:01:32.430 
the the back graphics are slightly

00:01:32.430 --> 00:01:35.719 
the the back graphics are slightly
darker<00:01:33.270> than<00:01:33.420> the<00:01:33.540> originals<00:01:34.490> that's<00:01:35.490> not<00:01:35.700> a

00:01:35.719 --> 00:01:35.729 
darker than the originals that's not a

00:01:35.729 --> 00:01:37.609 
darker than the originals that's not a
mark<00:01:36.030> on<00:01:36.180> the<00:01:36.329> on<00:01:36.479> the<00:01:36.659> record<00:01:36.810> sleeve<00:01:37.380> that's

00:01:37.609 --> 00:01:37.619 
mark on the on the record sleeve that's

00:01:37.619 --> 00:01:40.340 
mark on the on the record sleeve that's
just<00:01:37.920> a<00:01:38.009> cellophane<00:01:38.579> I<00:01:39.000> believe<00:01:39.750> this<00:01:39.900> is<00:01:40.020> most

00:01:40.340 --> 00:01:40.350 
just a cellophane I believe this is most

00:01:40.350 --> 00:01:42.410 
just a cellophane I believe this is most
apparent<00:01:40.770> really<00:01:41.310> with<00:01:41.460> the<00:01:41.579> killer's<00:01:42.000> album

00:01:42.410 --> 00:01:42.420 
apparent really with the killer's album

00:01:42.420 --> 00:01:43.670 
apparent really with the killer's album
if<00:01:42.750> you<00:01:42.810> look<00:01:42.960> at<00:01:43.049> the<00:01:43.110> picture<00:01:43.409> of<00:01:43.470> Dave

00:01:43.670 --> 00:01:43.680 
if you look at the picture of Dave

00:01:43.680 --> 00:01:45.740 
if you look at the picture of Dave
Murray<00:01:43.979> it<00:01:44.790> does<00:01:44.970> appear<00:01:45.270> to<00:01:45.420> be<00:01:45.540> slightly

00:01:45.740 --> 00:01:45.750 
Murray it does appear to be slightly

00:01:45.750 --> 00:01:49.340 
Murray it does appear to be slightly
darker<00:01:46.409> but<00:01:46.590> that's<00:01:46.770> just<00:01:47.180> printing<00:01:48.180> so<00:01:48.869> these

00:01:49.340 --> 00:01:49.350 
darker but that's just printing so these

00:01:49.350 --> 00:01:52.100 
darker but that's just printing so these
are<00:01:49.560> very<00:01:49.860> very<00:01:50.159> nice<00:01:50.430> with<00:01:51.329> the<00:01:51.450> addition<00:01:51.930> of

00:01:52.100 --> 00:01:52.110 
are very very nice with the addition of

00:01:52.110 --> 00:01:54.649
