this<00:01:38.430> isn't<00:01:38.729> what<00:01:39.000> it<00:01:39.119> is<00:01:39.329> in<00:01:39.600> real<00:01:39.869> life<00:01:40.140> we

00:01:40.609 --> 00:01:40.619 
this isn't what it is in real life we

00:01:40.619 --> 00:01:42.499 
this isn't what it is in real life we
don't<00:01:40.710> really<00:01:40.890> know<00:01:41.250> exactly<00:01:41.430> how<00:01:42.150> it<00:01:42.299> is<00:01:42.420> in

00:01:44.389 --> 00:01:44.399 
real life but we can assume that it's

00:01:44.399 --> 00:01:46.670 
real life but we can assume that it's
gonna<00:01:44.549> be<00:01:44.820> a<00:01:44.850> very<00:01:45.180> very<00:01:45.390> fast<00:01:45.869> it's<00:01:46.619> a

00:01:46.670 --> 00:01:46.680 
gonna be a very very fast it's a

00:01:46.680 --> 00:01:48.920 
gonna be a very very fast it's a
two-door<00:01:47.070> coupe<00:01:47.399> so<00:01:47.820> it's<00:01:48.360> not<00:01:48.509> going<00:01:48.689> to<00:01:48.750> be

00:01:48.920 --> 00:01:48.930 
two-door coupe so it's not going to be

00:01:48.930 --> 00:01:51.440 
two-door coupe so it's not going to be
too<00:01:49.619> heavy<00:01:49.920> on<00:01:50.250> us<00:01:50.280> and<00:01:50.670> it's<00:01:51.090> gonna<00:01:51.270> be

00:01:51.440 --> 00:01:51.450 
too heavy on us and it's gonna be

00:01:51.450 --> 00:01:53.780
