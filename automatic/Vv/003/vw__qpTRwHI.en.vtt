00:00:45.110 --> 00:00:45.120 
really useful to know a few of those

00:00:45.120 --> 00:00:47.420 
really useful to know a few of those
types<00:00:45.450> of<00:00:45.570> legs<00:00:45.780> so<00:00:45.899> you<00:00:45.989> can<00:00:46.170> throw<00:00:46.350> in<00:00:46.559> at<00:00:47.219> the

00:00:47.420 --> 00:00:47.430 
types of legs so you can throw in at the

00:00:47.430 --> 00:00:58.580 
types of legs so you can throw in at the
end<00:00:47.610> of<00:00:47.910> a<00:00:48.059> idea<00:00:56.690> there<00:00:57.690> again<00:00:57.870> I'm<00:00:58.020> starting<00:00:58.230> a

00:00:58.580 --> 00:00:58.590 
end of a idea there again I'm starting a

00:00:58.590 --> 00:01:00.200 
end of a idea there again I'm starting a
new<00:00:58.649> idea<00:00:59.309> and<00:00:59.399> then<00:00:59.550> I'm<00:00:59.640> ending<00:01:00.000> with<00:01:00.180> that

00:01:00.200 --> 00:01:00.210 
new idea and then I'm ending with that

00:01:00.210 --> 00:01:07.730 
new idea and then I'm ending with that
same<00:01:00.510> lick<00:01:05.540> can<00:01:06.540> play<00:01:06.720> it<00:01:06.780> fast<00:01:07.080> and<00:01:07.409> you<00:01:07.470> can

00:01:07.730 --> 00:01:07.740 
same lick can play it fast and you can

00:01:07.740 --> 00:01:10.280 
same lick can play it fast and you can
even<00:01:08.280> play<00:01:08.580> it<00:01:08.670> slow<00:01:08.970> like<00:01:09.840> I'm<00:01:10.020> almost

00:01:10.280 --> 00:01:10.290 
even play it slow like I'm almost

00:01:10.290 --> 00:01:21.020 
even play it slow like I'm almost
floating<00:01:10.650> in<00:01:10.830> time

00:01:21.020 --> 00:01:21.030 

00:01:21.030 --> 00:01:24.120 

so<00:01:22.030> the<00:01:22.840> lake<00:01:22.990> starts<00:01:23.320> on<00:01:23.470> the<00:01:23.620> ninth<00:01:23.800> fret<00:01:24.010> on

00:01:24.120 --> 00:01:24.130 
so the lake starts on the ninth fret on

00:01:24.130 --> 00:01:27.950 
so the lake starts on the ninth fret on
the<00:01:24.280> D<00:01:24.460> string<00:01:25.290> which<00:01:26.290> is<00:01:26.320> the<00:01:26.470> root<00:01:26.710> note<00:01:26.950> and

00:01:27.950 --> 00:01:27.960 
the D string which is the root note and

00:01:27.960 --> 00:01:30.270 
the D string which is the root note and
it's<00:01:28.960> also<00:01:29.110> going<00:01:29.380> to<00:01:29.470> end<00:01:29.590> we're<00:01:30.130> going<00:01:30.220> to

00:01:30.270 --> 00:01:30.280 
it's also going to end we're going to

00:01:30.280 --> 00:01:33.150 
it's also going to end we're going to
end<00:01:30.460> the<00:01:30.610> whole<00:01:30.700> lake<00:01:30.910> on<00:01:31.030> the<00:01:31.120> root<00:01:31.240> note<00:01:31.270> so<00:01:32.170> D

00:01:33.150 --> 00:01:33.160 
end the whole lake on the root note so D

00:01:33.160 --> 00:01:36.750 
end the whole lake on the root note so D
string<00:01:33.460> ninth<00:01:33.700> fret<00:01:33.940> and<00:01:34.650> then<00:01:35.650> up<00:01:35.950> to<00:01:36.490> the<00:01:36.580> g

00:01:36.750 --> 00:01:36.760

the seventh fret and what comes next
next<00:01:49.420> here<00:01:49.570> is<00:01:49.600> that<00:01:49.960> useful<00:01:51.360> move<00:01:52.360> where<00:01:52.810> you

00:01:53.450 --> 00:01:53.460 
next here is that useful move where you

00:01:53.460 --> 00:01:57.660 
next here is that useful move where you
use<00:01:54.460> you<00:01:54.790> play<00:01:55.090> the<00:01:55.270> up<00:01:55.620> the<00:01:56.620> note<00:01:56.830> here<00:01:57.250> on<00:01:57.640> the

00:01:57.660 --> 00:01:57.670 
use you play the up the note here on the

00:01:57.670 --> 00:01:59.460 
use you play the up the note here on the
B<00:01:57.880> string<00:01:57.940> and<00:01:58.270> then<00:01:58.510> with<00:01:59.050> the<00:01:59.140> index<00:01:59.410> finger

00:01:59.460 --> 00:01:59.470 
B string and then with the index finger

00:01:59.470 --> 00:02:03.600 
B string and then with the index finger
and<00:01:59.800> you<00:02:00.340> then<00:02:00.840> just<00:02:01.840> switch<00:02:02.560> strings<00:02:03.070> using

00:02:03.600 --> 00:02:03.610 
and you then just switch strings using

00:02:03.610 --> 00:02:08.730 
and you then just switch strings using
the<00:02:03.790> same<00:02:04.060> finger<00:02:04.360> in<00:02:04.420> the<00:02:04.510> same<00:02:04.690> fret<00:02:07.740> that's

00:02:08.730 --> 00:02:08.740 
the same finger in the same fret that's

00:02:08.740 --> 00:02:11.660 
the same finger in the same fret that's
a<00:02:08.920> really<00:02:09.220> cool<00:02:09.760> little<00:02:09.910> idea<00:02:10.149> in<00:02:10.390> itself

00:02:11.660 --> 00:02:11.670 
a really cool little idea in itself

00:02:11.670 --> 00:02:16.020 
a really cool little idea in itself
because<00:02:12.670> that<00:02:12.700> would<00:02:12.940> be<00:02:13.030> hard<00:02:13.300> to<00:02:13.360> play<00:02:15.030> if

00:02:16.020 --> 00:02:16.030 
because that would be hard to play if

00:02:16.030 --> 00:02:17.580 
because that would be hard to play if
you<00:02:16.180> played<00:02:16.450> those<00:02:16.720> three<00:02:17.020> notes<00:02:17.080> on<00:02:17.500> the<00:02:17.560> g

00:02:17.580 --> 00:02:17.590 
you played those three notes on the g

00:02:17.590 --> 00:02:21.150 
you played those three notes on the g
string<00:02:18.990> you<00:02:19.990> have<00:02:20.020> have<00:02:20.650> to<00:02:20.770> go<00:02:20.860> up<00:02:20.980> to<00:02:21.100> the

00:02:21.150 --> 00:02:21.160 
string you have have to go up to the

00:02:21.160 --> 00:02:24.990 
string you have have to go up to the
11th<00:02:21.430> fret<00:02:21.690> and<00:02:22.690> then<00:02:23.200> and<00:02:23.500> then<00:02:24.280> down<00:02:24.580> to<00:02:24.820> the

00:02:24.990 --> 00:02:25.000 
11th fret and then and then down to the

00:02:25.000 --> 00:02:26.820 
11th fret and then and then down to the
seventh<00:02:25.300> fret<00:02:25.390> and<00:02:25.780> that's<00:02:26.470> not<00:02:26.650> as

00:02:26.820 --> 00:02:26.830 
seventh fret and that's not as

00:02:26.830 --> 00:02:31.670 
seventh fret and that's not as
convenient<00:02:27.280> of<00:02:27.670> a<00:02:27.760> move<00:02:27.970> as<00:02:29.190> as<00:02:30.190> that<00:02:30.700> one

00:02:31.670 --> 00:02:31.680 
convenient of a move as as that one

00:02:31.680 --> 00:02:34.140 
convenient of a move as as that one
because<00:02:32.680> now<00:02:32.830> your<00:02:33.010> hand<00:02:33.220> is<00:02:33.370> one<00:02:33.610> spot<00:02:33.910> and

00:02:34.140 --> 00:02:34.150 
because now your hand is one spot and

00:02:34.150 --> 00:02:36.180 
because now your hand is one spot and
you<00:02:34.209> just<00:02:34.480> move<00:02:34.750> just<00:02:35.590> flipping<00:02:35.950> over<00:02:36.070> the

00:02:36.180 --> 00:02:36.190 
you just move just flipping over the

00:02:36.190 --> 00:02:39.750 
you just move just flipping over the
index<00:02:36.580> finger<00:02:36.850> sort<00:02:37.090> of<00:02:37.150> thing<00:02:38.520> you<00:02:39.520> can't

00:02:39.750 --> 00:02:39.760 
index finger sort of thing you can't

00:02:39.760 --> 00:02:41.070 
index finger sort of thing you can't
start<00:02:40.000> with<00:02:40.060> a<00:02:40.150> hammer<00:02:40.390> on<00:02:40.510> or<00:02:40.660> you<00:02:40.750> can<00:02:40.900> pick

00:02:41.070 --> 00:02:41.080 
start with a hammer on or you can pick

00:02:41.080 --> 00:02:47.070 
start with a hammer on or you can pick
those<00:02:41.320> first<00:02:42.330> the<00:02:43.330> second<00:02:43.690> note<00:02:43.780> nasur<00:02:44.170> note

00:02:47.070 --> 00:02:47.080 

00:02:47.080 --> 00:02:49.260 

they're<00:02:47.950> picking<00:02:48.250> all<00:02:48.520> them<00:02:48.730> but<00:02:49.030> I<00:02:49.060> could

00:02:49.260 --> 00:02:49.270 
they're picking all them but I could

00:02:49.270 --> 00:02:56.010 
they're picking all them but I could
also<00:02:49.420> do<00:02:52.290> that<00:02:53.290> I<00:02:53.320> did<00:02:53.530> a<00:02:53.560> hammer-on<00:02:53.920> from<00:02:55.020> up

00:02:56.010 --> 00:02:56.020 
also do that I did a hammer-on from up

00:02:56.020 --> 00:03:13.140 
also do that I did a hammer-on from up
to<00:02:57.330> right<00:03:05.190> and<00:03:06.190> after<00:03:06.790> that<00:03:10.980> go<00:03:11.980> down<00:03:12.160> to<00:03:12.370> the<00:03:12.490> D

00:03:13.140 --> 00:03:13.150 
to right and after that go down to the D
