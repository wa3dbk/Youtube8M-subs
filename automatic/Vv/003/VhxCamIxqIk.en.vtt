00:00:00.740 --> 00:00:06.500
 Now we are in the Podgorica capital 

00:00:04.020 --> 00:00:06.500
 Montenegro 

00:00:10.370 --> 00:00:13.750
 which cities 

00:00:14.480 --> 00:00:22.390
 storyteller's monument 

00:00:17.560 --> 00:00:25.710
 it is clear that this is a country 

00:00:22.390 --> 00:00:25.710
 you are their former socialist camp 

00:00:29.350 --> 00:00:36.660
 This is not France This is not Spain and this 

00:00:32.349 --> 00:00:36.660
 whether not germany 

00:00:39.470 --> 00:00:45.530
 somewhere so at the level probably Poland 

00:00:41.570 --> 00:00:47.800
 although it seems to me that the benefits of such 

00:00:45.530 --> 00:00:47.800
 what 

00:00:48.350 --> 00:00:58.690
 Now we will interview our tourists 

00:00:53.530 --> 00:00:58.690
 who arrived from sunny Ukraine 

00:01:00.200 --> 00:01:03.130
 applause 

00:01:03.760 --> 00:01:09.520
 and since your sense of capital 

00:01:06.640 --> 00:01:13.360
 Montenegro from the biggest city in 

00:01:09.520 --> 00:01:17.310
 Montenegro where lives practically 

00:01:13.360 --> 00:01:17.310
 if I'm not mistaken a third of the population of the party 

00:01:18.290 --> 00:01:22.060
 can be said but 

00:01:19.810 --> 00:01:27.329
 but honestly not 

00:01:22.060 --> 00:01:27.329
 walks by which I do not see 

00:01:28.960 --> 00:01:31.979
 as a vision 

00:01:37.330 --> 00:01:44.420
 at least the roads are better than ours 

00:01:40.970 --> 00:01:46.690
 when the house is greyish he does not lock 

00:01:44.420 --> 00:01:51.630
 painted by him 

00:01:46.690 --> 00:01:55.009
 But a lot of green in their partners Russia 

00:01:51.630 --> 00:01:55.009
 grass is not cut 

00:02:01.000 --> 00:02:03.480
 people in general 

00:02:08.789 --> 00:02:14.760
 we have 

00:02:10.450 --> 00:02:14.760
 the sidewalks are not very beautiful 

00:02:15.930 --> 00:02:21.629
 we have already lowered the roof 

00:02:18.769 --> 00:02:24.620
 because it's already hot now 

00:02:21.629 --> 00:02:24.620

00:02:25.210 --> 00:02:29.490

00:03:05.010 --> 00:03:07.610
 Ukraine

 famous millennium bridge 

00:03:37.750 --> 00:03:44.220
 rarely with beautiful color 

00:03:41.920 --> 00:03:44.220
