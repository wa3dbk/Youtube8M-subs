hi<00:00:01.050> this<00:00:01.740> weighs<00:00:02.040> about<00:00:02.070> projection<00:00:02.939> of

00:00:03.139 --> 00:00:03.149 
hi this weighs about projection of

00:00:03.149 --> 00:00:06.619 
hi this weighs about projection of
planes<00:00:03.570> so<00:00:04.470> this<00:00:04.740> is<00:00:04.890> a<00:00:04.920> problem<00:00:05.430> here<00:00:05.670> that<00:00:05.879> n

00:00:06.619 --> 00:00:06.629 
planes so this is a problem here that n

00:00:06.629 --> 00:00:09.500 
planes so this is a problem here that n
I<00:00:06.899> saw<00:00:07.109> scales<00:00:07.470> triangle<00:00:08.160> plate<00:00:08.639> ABC<00:00:09.179> having

00:00:09.500 --> 00:00:09.510 
I saw scales triangle plate ABC having

00:00:09.510 --> 00:00:13.370 
I saw scales triangle plate ABC having
its<00:00:09.690> base<00:00:09.960> 40mm<00:00:10.710> in<00:00:11.000> altitude<00:00:12.000> 70<00:00:12.750> mm<00:00:12.990> pressed

00:00:13.370 --> 00:00:13.380 
its base 40mm in altitude 70 mm pressed

00:00:13.380 --> 00:00:16.670 
its base 40mm in altitude 70 mm pressed
in<00:00:13.590> one<00:00:13.769> horizontal<00:00:14.460> plane<00:00:14.670> on<00:00:14.910> its<00:00:15.150> base<00:00:15.680> the

00:00:16.670 --> 00:00:16.680 
in one horizontal plane on its base the

00:00:16.680 --> 00:00:19.609 
in one horizontal plane on its base the
ISO<00:00:16.890> scaled<00:00:17.310> triangle<00:00:17.760> is<00:00:17.850> inclined<00:00:18.330> at<00:00:18.619> angle

00:00:19.609 --> 00:00:19.619 
ISO scaled triangle is inclined at angle

00:00:19.619 --> 00:00:22.060 
ISO scaled triangle is inclined at angle
40<00:00:19.949> degree<00:00:20.250> to<00:00:20.580> the<00:00:20.699> horizontal<00:00:20.730> plane<00:00:21.359> and

00:00:22.060 --> 00:00:22.070 
40 degree to the horizontal plane and

00:00:22.070 --> 00:00:25.580 
40 degree to the horizontal plane and
altitude<00:00:23.070> in<00:00:23.850> the<00:00:24.090> top<00:00:24.390> view<00:00:24.660> is<00:00:24.840> inclined<00:00:25.320> at

00:00:25.580 --> 00:00:25.590 
altitude in the top view is inclined at

00:00:25.590 --> 00:00:28.099 
altitude in the top view is inclined at
angle<00:00:26.279> 60<00:00:26.609> degree<00:00:26.910> to<00:00:27.060> vertical<00:00:27.449> plane<00:00:27.720> draw

00:00:28.099 --> 00:00:28.109 
angle 60 degree to vertical plane draw

00:00:28.109 --> 00:00:31.700 
angle 60 degree to vertical plane draw
the<00:00:28.170> projections<00:00:28.859> okay<00:00:29.789> so<00:00:30.170> this<00:00:31.170> is<00:00:31.380> what<00:00:31.590> if

00:00:31.700 --> 00:00:31.710 
the projections okay so this is what if

00:00:31.710 --> 00:00:33.560 
the projections okay so this is what if
something<00:00:32.070> look<00:00:32.250> like<00:00:32.460> so<00:00:32.850> this<00:00:33.030> is<00:00:33.210> the<00:00:33.329> first

00:00:33.560 --> 00:00:33.570 
something look like so this is the first

00:00:33.570 --> 00:00:36.410 
something look like so this is the first
angle<00:00:33.780> here<00:00:34.230> or<00:00:35.010> this<00:00:35.219> is<00:00:35.460> a<00:00:35.610> scale<00:00:35.880> triangle

00:00:36.410 --> 00:00:36.420 
angle here or this is a scale triangle

00:00:36.420 --> 00:00:41.030 
angle here or this is a scale triangle
sitting<00:00:37.219> in<00:00:38.219> this<00:00:39.149> position<00:00:39.660> then<00:00:40.649> you<00:00:40.829> will

00:00:41.030 --> 00:00:41.040 
sitting in this position then you will

00:00:41.040 --> 00:00:44.240 
sitting in this position then you will
lift<00:00:41.280> a<00:00:41.489> 40<00:00:41.879> degree<00:00:42.030> now<00:00:42.719> with<00:00:43.649> respect<00:00:44.129> to

00:00:44.240 --> 00:00:44.250 
lift a 40 degree now with respect to

00:00:44.250 --> 00:00:47.270 
lift a 40 degree now with respect to
this<00:00:44.399> horizontal<00:00:45.030> plane<00:00:45.270> and<00:00:46.200> after<00:00:46.770> that<00:00:47.010> it

00:00:47.270 --> 00:00:47.280 
this horizontal plane and after that it

00:00:47.280 --> 00:00:51.410 
this horizontal plane and after that it
is<00:00:47.309> tilted<00:00:47.820> at<00:00:48.690> 60<00:00:49.200> degree<00:00:49.820> so<00:00:50.820> it<00:00:50.879> is<00:00:51.030> making

00:00:51.410 --> 00:00:51.420 
is tilted at 60 degree so it is making

00:00:51.420 --> 00:00:53.510 
is tilted at 60 degree so it is making
60<00:00:51.870> degree<00:00:52.079> with<00:00:52.289> the<00:00:52.350> vertical<00:00:52.500> plane<00:00:53.100> here

00:00:53.510 --> 00:00:53.520 
60 degree with the vertical plane here

00:00:53.520 --> 00:00:55.779 
60 degree with the vertical plane here
okay<00:00:54.180> so<00:00:54.210> we<00:00:54.510> have<00:00:54.600> to<00:00:54.750> draw<00:00:54.870> the<00:00:54.930> projection

00:00:55.779 --> 00:00:55.789 
okay so we have to draw the projection

00:00:55.789 --> 00:01:00.349 
okay so we have to draw the projection
so<00:00:56.789> if<00:00:57.600> I<00:00:57.809> go<00:00:58.079> to<00:00:58.140> this<00:00:58.500> third<00:00:58.800> time<00:00:59.039> so<00:00:59.550> this<00:01:00.300> is

00:01:00.349 --> 00:01:00.359 
so if I go to this third time so this is

00:01:00.359 --> 00:01:04.189 
so if I go to this third time so this is
the<00:01:00.539> first<00:01:00.930> appear<00:01:01.469> select<00:01:02.250> me<00:01:02.640> mark<00:01:03.449> here<00:01:03.780> the

00:01:04.189 --> 00:01:04.199 
the first appear select me mark here the

00:01:04.199 --> 00:01:06.910 
the first appear select me mark here the
number<00:01:04.500> of<00:01:04.619> step<00:01:04.920> that<00:01:05.159> we<00:01:05.369> are<00:01:05.400> going<00:01:05.460> to<00:01:05.700> do

00:01:06.910 --> 00:01:06.920 
number of step that we are going to do

00:01:06.920 --> 00:01:12.399 
number of step that we are going to do
so<00:01:07.920> this<00:01:08.189> one<00:01:08.430> will<00:01:09.180> be<00:01:09.240> the<00:01:09.420> first<00:01:10.020> one<00:01:10.290> here

00:01:12.399 --> 00:01:12.409 
so this one will be the first one here

00:01:12.409 --> 00:01:17.120 
so this one will be the first one here
so<00:01:13.409> this<00:01:13.799> will<00:01:14.729> be<00:01:14.880> the<00:01:15.090> first<00:01:15.479> step<00:01:16.100> if<00:01:17.100> you

00:01:17.120 --> 00:01:17.130 
so this will be the first step if you

00:01:17.130 --> 00:01:20.810 
so this will be the first step if you
draw<00:01:17.430> this<00:01:17.640> triangle<00:01:17.970> here<00:01:18.650> then<00:01:19.650> you<00:01:20.520> make<00:01:20.700> a

00:01:20.810 --> 00:01:20.820 
draw this triangle here then you make a

00:01:20.820 --> 00:01:23.480 
draw this triangle here then you make a
little<00:01:20.939> bit<00:01:21.360> smaller<00:01:21.799> okay<00:01:22.799> so<00:01:22.860> that's<00:01:23.220> the

00:01:23.480 --> 00:01:23.490 
little bit smaller okay so that's the

00:01:23.490 --> 00:01:27.640 
little bit smaller okay so that's the
first<00:01:23.520> time<00:01:24.320> then<00:01:25.320> we<00:01:25.610> draw<00:01:26.610> this<00:01:26.939> line<00:01:27.000> here

00:01:27.640 --> 00:01:27.650 
first time then we draw this line here

00:01:27.650 --> 00:01:31.100 
first time then we draw this line here
that<00:01:28.650> will<00:01:28.829> be<00:01:28.950> the<00:01:29.070> step<00:01:29.340> number<00:01:29.490> two<00:01:30.079> okay<00:01:31.079> so

00:01:31.100 --> 00:01:31.110 
that will be the step number two okay so

00:01:31.110 --> 00:01:34.670 
that will be the step number two okay so
this<00:01:32.100> is<00:01:32.340> on<00:01:32.520> the<00:01:32.670> top<00:01:32.909> view<00:01:33.119> here<00:01:33.360> and<00:01:33.570> this<00:01:34.470> is

00:01:34.670 --> 00:01:34.680 
this is on the top view here and this is

00:01:34.680 --> 00:01:37.520 
this is on the top view here and this is
from<00:01:34.950> the<00:01:35.220> front<00:01:35.520> view<00:01:35.930> once<00:01:36.930> we<00:01:37.110> have<00:01:37.320> that

00:01:37.520 --> 00:01:37.530 
from the front view once we have that

00:01:37.530 --> 00:01:40.850 
from the front view once we have that
one<00:01:37.799> the<00:01:38.400> next<00:01:38.670> step<00:01:39.000> will<00:01:39.270> be<00:01:39.299> to<00:01:39.680> make<00:01:40.680> this

00:01:40.850 --> 00:01:40.860 
one the next step will be to make this

00:01:40.860 --> 00:01:46.190 
one the next step will be to make this
40<00:01:41.280> degree<00:01:41.610> okay<00:01:42.450> so<00:01:42.509> this<00:01:44.119> will<00:01:45.119> be<00:01:45.329> done<00:01:45.570> step

00:01:46.190 --> 00:01:46.200 
40 degree okay so this will be done step

00:01:46.200 --> 00:01:50.240 
40 degree okay so this will be done step
number<00:01:46.380> three<00:01:46.920> here<00:01:47.630> we<00:01:48.630> make<00:01:48.840> this<00:01:49.250> claim

00:01:50.240 --> 00:01:50.250 
number three here we make this claim

00:01:50.250 --> 00:01:54.200 
number three here we make this claim
attack<00:01:50.909> this<00:01:51.600> line<00:01:51.930> at<00:01:52.140> a<00:01:52.229> 40-degree<00:01:52.970> once<00:01:53.970> we

00:01:54.200 --> 00:01:54.210 
attack this line at a 40-degree once we

00:01:54.210 --> 00:01:58.179 
attack this line at a 40-degree once we
have<00:01:54.479> that<00:01:54.750> line<00:01:55.520> so<00:01:56.520> then<00:01:56.759> we<00:01:57.270> extend<00:01:57.780> this<00:01:57.899> a

00:01:58.179 --> 00:01:58.189 
have that line so then we extend this a

00:01:58.189 --> 00:02:04.010 
have that line so then we extend this a
B<00:01:59.189> and<00:02:00.000> C<00:02:00.450> and<00:02:01.079> also<00:02:01.409> we<00:02:01.969> extend<00:02:02.969> this<00:02:03.119> a<00:02:03.390> dash<00:02:03.630> B

00:02:04.010 --> 00:02:04.020 
B and C and also we extend this a dash B

00:02:04.020 --> 00:02:08.690 
B and C and also we extend this a dash B
Dash<00:02:04.229> and<00:02:04.469> series<00:02:05.570> so<00:02:06.570> this<00:02:06.840> point<00:02:07.320> here<00:02:07.590> is<00:02:07.740> a

00:02:08.690 --> 00:02:08.700 
Dash and series so this point here is a

00:02:08.700 --> 00:02:09.630 
Dash and series so this point here is a
any

00:02:09.630 --> 00:02:09.640 
any

00:02:09.640 --> 00:02:12.360 
any
a<00:02:09.759> from<00:02:10.690> top<00:02:10.990> okay<00:02:11.350> so<00:02:11.410> once<00:02:11.800> they<00:02:12.069> both

00:02:12.360 --> 00:02:12.370 
a from top okay so once they both

00:02:12.370 --> 00:02:16.110 
a from top okay so once they both
intersect<00:02:12.970> that<00:02:13.870> will<00:02:14.020> be<00:02:14.170> over<00:02:14.380> a<00:02:15.120> similarly

00:02:16.110 --> 00:02:16.120 
intersect that will be over a similarly

00:02:16.120 --> 00:02:21.180 
intersect that will be over a similarly
b<00:02:17.020> and<00:02:17.319> b<00:02:17.430> here<00:02:18.430> and<00:02:18.880> this<00:02:19.540> c<00:02:19.900> and<00:02:20.170> say<00:02:20.950> this

00:02:21.180 --> 00:02:21.190 
b and b here and this c and say this

00:02:21.190 --> 00:02:23.430 
b and b here and this c and say this
once<00:02:22.030> the<00:02:22.209> intersect<00:02:22.750> this<00:02:23.020> will<00:02:23.200> be<00:02:23.319> our

00:02:23.430 --> 00:02:23.440 
once the intersect this will be our

00:02:23.440 --> 00:02:26.280 
once the intersect this will be our
third<00:02:23.560> point<00:02:24.040> okay<00:02:24.790> so<00:02:24.819> this<00:02:25.209> is<00:02:25.480> how<00:02:25.750> the

00:02:26.280 --> 00:02:26.290 
third point okay so this is how the

00:02:26.290 --> 00:02:28.650 
third point okay so this is how the
stronger<00:02:26.920> will<00:02:27.130> look<00:02:27.310> like<00:02:27.580> from<00:02:28.150> the<00:02:28.360> top

00:02:28.650 --> 00:02:28.660 
stronger will look like from the top

00:02:28.660 --> 00:02:32.010 
stronger will look like from the top
view<00:02:28.690> so<00:02:29.760> that<00:02:30.760> will<00:02:30.970> be<00:02:31.090> the<00:02:31.360> step<00:02:31.810> number

00:02:32.010 --> 00:02:32.020 
view so that will be the step number

00:02:32.020 --> 00:02:37.140 
view so that will be the step number
four<00:02:32.530> here<00:02:34.590> once<00:02:35.590> you<00:02:35.770> have<00:02:35.980> that<00:02:36.220> one<00:02:36.489> the

00:02:37.140 --> 00:02:37.150 
four here once you have that one the

00:02:37.150 --> 00:02:40.320 
four here once you have that one the
next<00:02:37.510> step<00:02:37.750> will<00:02:37.989> be<00:02:38.020> to<00:02:38.170> make<00:02:38.670> this<00:02:39.670> altitude

00:02:40.320 --> 00:02:40.330 
next step will be to make this altitude

00:02:40.330 --> 00:02:43.170 
next step will be to make this altitude
of<00:02:41.020> this<00:02:41.260> triangle<00:02:41.590> such<00:02:42.489> a<00:02:42.520> way<00:02:42.790> that<00:02:42.820> it

00:02:43.170 --> 00:02:43.180 
of this triangle such a way that it

00:02:43.180 --> 00:02:46.140 
of this triangle such a way that it
makes<00:02:43.420> 60<00:02:43.870> degree<00:02:44.200> in<00:02:44.380> this<00:02:45.100> 60<00:02:45.550> degree<00:02:45.700> we<00:02:46.030> are

00:02:46.140 --> 00:02:46.150 
makes 60 degree in this 60 degree we are

00:02:46.150 --> 00:02:48.720 
makes 60 degree in this 60 degree we are
looking<00:02:46.510> from<00:02:46.720> the<00:02:46.840> top<00:02:47.010> so<00:02:48.010> that<00:02:48.040> will<00:02:48.430> be<00:02:48.550> the

00:02:48.720 --> 00:02:48.730 
looking from the top so that will be the

00:02:48.730 --> 00:02:52.949 
looking from the top so that will be the
step<00:02:49.000> number<00:02:49.180> five<00:02:50.550> okay<00:02:51.550> so<00:02:52.090> this<00:02:52.420> one<00:02:52.720> will

00:02:52.949 --> 00:02:52.959 
step number five okay so this one will

00:02:52.959 --> 00:02:56.160 
step number five okay so this one will
be<00:02:53.050> the<00:02:53.080> step<00:02:53.410> number<00:02:53.530> five<00:02:54.010> now<00:02:55.000> we<00:02:55.060> have<00:02:55.330> a<00:02:55.570> B

00:02:56.160 --> 00:02:56.170 
be the step number five now we have a B

00:02:56.170 --> 00:03:01.320 
be the step number five now we have a B
and<00:02:56.440> C<00:02:57.390> similarly<00:02:58.950> once<00:02:59.950> we<00:03:00.220> extend<00:03:00.730> all<00:03:00.910> these

00:03:01.320 --> 00:03:01.330 
and C similarly once we extend all these

00:03:01.330 --> 00:03:07.229 
and C similarly once we extend all these
lines<00:03:01.750> and<00:03:02.350> then<00:03:02.739> we<00:03:03.280> extend<00:03:03.820> from<00:03:04.209> here<00:03:05.940> the<00:03:06.940> C

00:03:07.229 --> 00:03:07.239 
lines and then we extend from here the C

00:03:07.239 --> 00:03:11.699 
lines and then we extend from here the C
-<00:03:07.450> it<00:03:07.750> is<00:03:08.019> in<00:03:08.200> betas<00:03:08.590> invent<00:03:09.550> a<00:03:09.760> dis<00:03:10.540> a<00:03:10.840> and<00:03:11.470> a

00:03:11.699 --> 00:03:11.709 
- it is in betas invent a dis a and a

00:03:11.709 --> 00:03:14.009 
- it is in betas invent a dis a and a
decimate<00:03:12.280> that's<00:03:13.090> the<00:03:13.269> second<00:03:13.600> point

00:03:14.009 --> 00:03:14.019 
decimate that's the second point

00:03:14.019 --> 00:03:17.699 
decimate that's the second point
okay<00:03:14.650> similarly<00:03:15.310> beta<00:03:15.519> s<00:03:15.730> and<00:03:16.060> B<00:03:16.630> when<00:03:17.470> they

okay similarly beta s and B when they

00:03:17.709 --> 00:03:20.490 
okay similarly beta s and B when they
both<00:03:17.860> meet<00:03:18.280> that<00:03:18.700> will<00:03:18.880> be<00:03:19.030> the<00:03:19.209> here<00:03:20.049> that

00:03:20.490 --> 00:03:20.500 
both meet that will be the here that

00:03:20.500 --> 00:03:22.430 
both meet that will be the here that
will<00:03:20.709> be<00:03:20.769> the<00:03:20.890> B<00:03:21.070> this<00:03:21.250> here

00:03:22.430 --> 00:03:22.440 
will be the B this here

00:03:22.440 --> 00:03:26.550 
will be the B this here
okay<00:03:23.440> now<00:03:23.739> this<00:03:23.920> will<00:03:24.100> be<00:03:24.280> a<00:03:24.430> -<00:03:25.239> and<00:03:25.600> this<00:03:26.350> will

00:03:26.550 --> 00:03:26.560 
okay now this will be a - and this will

be you see this here so if I to give the

00:03:29.650 --> 00:03:33.900 
be you see this here so if I to give the
number<00:03:29.769> and<00:03:30.489> cross<00:03:31.590> C<00:03:32.590> and<00:03:32.769> control<00:03:33.190> V<00:03:33.220> so<00:03:33.730> this

00:03:33.900 --> 00:03:33.910 
number and cross C and control V so this

00:03:33.910 --> 00:03:42.360 
number and cross C and control V so this
will<00:03:34.180> be<00:03:34.269> the<00:03:34.480> C<00:03:35.260> -<00:03:39.690> okay<00:03:40.690> and<00:03:40.930> this<00:03:41.530> point<00:03:42.010> will

00:03:42.360 --> 00:03:42.370 
will be the C - okay and this point will

00:03:42.370 --> 00:03:49.830 
will be the C - okay and this point will
be<00:03:42.519> a<00:03:42.700> -<00:03:44.340> and<00:03:45.780> by<00:03:46.780> doing<00:03:47.320> this

00:03:49.830 --> 00:03:49.840 

00:03:49.840 --> 00:03:53.400 

when<00:03:50.500> this<00:03:50.830> will<00:03:51.040> be<00:03:51.190> the<00:03:51.610> bee<00:03:51.790> -<00:03:52.170> and<00:03:53.170> this

00:03:53.400 --> 00:03:53.410 
when this will be the bee - and this

00:03:53.410 --> 00:04:02.850 
when this will be the bee - and this
will<00:03:53.650> be<00:03:53.800> the<00:03:54.640> step<00:03:54.970> number<00:03:55.209> six<00:03:55.840> here<00:04:01.260> so<00:04:02.260> that

00:04:02.850 --> 00:04:02.860 
will be the step number six here so that

00:04:02.860 --> 00:04:04.620 
will be the step number six here so that
will<00:04:03.100> be<00:04:03.250> the<00:04:03.459> process<00:04:03.700> to<00:04:04.270> down<00:04:04.480> the

00:04:04.620 --> 00:04:04.630 
will be the process to down the

00:04:04.630 --> 00:04:08.130 
will be the process to down the
projection<00:04:05.170> of<00:04:05.290> planes<00:04:05.560> again<00:04:06.550> to<00:04:06.819> recap<00:04:07.150> now

00:04:08.130 --> 00:04:08.140 
projection of planes again to recap now

00:04:08.140 --> 00:04:11.370 
projection of planes again to recap now
we<00:04:08.500> first<00:04:09.069> polish<00:04:09.610> triangle<00:04:10.150> from<00:04:10.989> the<00:04:11.050> top

00:04:11.370 --> 00:04:11.380 
we first polish triangle from the top

00:04:11.380 --> 00:04:14.280 
we first polish triangle from the top
view<00:04:11.590> front<00:04:11.830> view<00:04:12.610> then<00:04:13.360> we<00:04:13.510> lift<00:04:13.750> this<00:04:14.020> line

00:04:14.280 --> 00:04:14.290 
view front view then we lift this line

00:04:14.290 --> 00:04:18.390 
view front view then we lift this line
at<00:04:14.470> 40<00:04:14.830> degree<00:04:15.160> step<00:04:16.000> number<00:04:16.150> three<00:04:16.889> we<00:04:17.889> extend
