00:00:43.670 --> 00:00:45.990
 graphics that will cover the modeling 

00:00:45.990 --> 00:00:48.010
 videos and the intros 

00:00:48.010 --> 00:00:51.010
 sounds that will span lapse and sound effects 

00:00:51.520 --> 00:00:54.680
 duration that covers how long the game lasts 

00:00:54.680 --> 00:00:57.680

00:01:07.320 --> 00:01:11.300
 to that I go the game that we will analyze is one of the I do not understand favorite of the 

00:01:11.300 --> 00:01:15.240
 thieves the nintendo ds xd xd xd xd must 

00:01:15.240 --> 00:01:19.370
 the game is the first installment of one of the best sagas of videogames 

00:01:19.369 --> 00:01:21.930
 grand theft auto chinatown swaps 

00:01:21.930 --> 00:01:26.020
 the story is about you being a little boy called juanje that after the death of his 

00:01:26.020 --> 00:01:29.940
 father who was a fucking and a great page does not have to give him a sword 

00:01:29.940 --> 00:01:32.550
 who represents the honor of his fucking family 

00:01:32.550 --> 00:01:36.960
 then some uncles kidnap him and steal his sword and throw him the sea 

00:01:36.960 --> 00:01:41.320
 Thursday according to verdú lecca to shut up since you are going to bother the story 

00:01:41.320 --> 00:01:45.320
 calloia or call the illuminated 7 so that you clarify how good a chrome 

00:01:45.320 --> 00:01:48.870
 we'll start with the graphics the graphics are fine for the console 

00:01:48.870 --> 00:01:52.650
 I do not understand with an aerial view like what we could see in the first two 

00:01:52.650 --> 00:01:53.840
 Grand Theft Auto 

00:01:53.840 --> 00:01:57.820
 the designs are correct but sometimes there are slight errors like 

00:01:57.820 --> 00:02:00.030
 fast the scenario is not completed 

00:02:00.030 --> 00:02:04.350
 It should be noted that to be a game of pstn a lot of freedom of action and that 

00:02:04.350 --> 00:02:06.490
 share the delta map 4 

00:02:06.490 --> 00:02:10.500
 let's move on to the videos the videos are developed by sima genes as a 

00:02:10.500 --> 00:02:11.329
 comic 

00:02:11.329 --> 00:02:15.159
 now the intro this is the most negative part since it does not have like 

00:02:15.159 --> 00:02:16.349
 great favorites 

00:02:16.349 --> 00:02:20.079
 just start, you are asked to create a user and then the second time 

00:02:20.079 --> 00:02:23.830

00:02:23.829 --> 00:02:27.750
 of drugs and replay the missions to get medals and raise the percentage 

00:02:27.749 --> 00:02:29.589

00:02:29.589 --> 00:02:33.809
 well we pass to the sound today the second double champion fly day receives this 

00:02:33.809 --> 00:02:38.019
 part of agreement but do it well or if I will not call don breast to give you for 

00:02:38.019 --> 00:02:42.249
 good ass the sound is like those of other great theft auto when you climb a 

00:02:42.249 --> 00:02:43.659
 mucus car 

00:02:43.659 --> 00:02:46.659
 launched biomass radio with several stations 

00:02:47.839 --> 00:02:51.369
 in this great theft auto the music are catchy melodies 

00:02:52.659 --> 00:02:57.749
 now let's see the sounds people talk the shots were heard realistic and every 

00:02:57.749 --> 00:03:00.069
 car sounds different 

00:03:00.069 --> 00:03:04.689

00:03:05.279 --> 00:03:08.279

 now we will analyze the fun 

00:04:06.959 --> 00:04:11.539
 well we have a great theft full-blown car in which rockstar Sudanese returns 

00:04:11.539 --> 00:04:15.879
 to its origins in one of the best games of the bbc and that responds to the 

00:04:15.879 --> 00:04:19.699
 complaints of those who said that the bbc only had several and pokémons 

00:04:20.549 --> 00:04:25.050
 and how not this great theft auto brought news like a business in which 

00:04:25.050 --> 00:04:29.740
 we manage the drug that we will get by buying it from other camels or stealing the 

00:04:29.740 --> 00:04:31.590
 another are bands 

00:04:31.590 --> 00:04:36.090
 to get weapons oas we will take media between our mobile or blackberry or what 

00:04:36.090 --> 00:04:39.559
 that shit be xd xd xd green 

00:04:39.559 --> 00:04:43.849
 then we will order the order and take it to our flat franco 

00:04:45.069 --> 00:04:48.169
 we will also get it by stealing amunátegui trucks 

00:04:49.439 --> 00:04:53.389
 we can also do the typical police missions in which 

00:04:53.389 --> 00:04:58.499
 of doctors we will choose missions by a computer like in theft auto 4 

00:04:58.499 --> 00:05:01.899
 firemen and others as a distributor of Chinese noodles 

00:05:02.740 --> 00:05:07.610
 now we will go to the touch screen there will be minigames like bridging 

00:05:07.610 --> 00:05:13.139
 garages make molotov cocktails mount snipers do tattoos and so on 

00:05:14.129 --> 00:05:19.979
 well now we will move on to the conclusions sw every front thank you rekindled not this 

00:05:19.979 --> 00:05:23.759
 is one of the best games of the ds with a great gameplay in which 

00:05:23.759 --> 00:05:26.840
 They can do a thousand things like driving at full speed 

00:05:26.840 --> 00:05:27.759
 be a policeman 

00:05:27.759 --> 00:05:31.039
 camel dealer and so on 

00:05:31.039 --> 00:05:35.419
 oo would be the soundtrack composed of melody but by songs as in 

00:05:35.419 --> 00:05:37.270
 other great cars 

00:05:37.270 --> 00:05:40.220
 we give this game a '9' since the gameplay 

00:05:40.220 --> 00:05:44.020
 the graphics to be of bs are at the height of the playstation versions 

00:05:44.020 --> 00:05:46.479
 xbox and psp 

00:05:46.479 --> 00:05:49.289
 well I say goodbye but not without a joke 

00:05:49.289 --> 00:05:54.319
 enters the illuminated 7 to a butcher shop and says let's rehabilitate touch not fuck not 

00:05:54.319 --> 00:05:57.029
 I want to put a voice to that fat beast and 

00:05:57.029 --> 00:06:01.329

00:06:01.329 --> 00:06:02.449
 He says

00:06:19.419 --> 00:06:23.169
