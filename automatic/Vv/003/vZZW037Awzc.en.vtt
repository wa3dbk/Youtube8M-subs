00:00:27.420 --> 00:00:27.430 
obviously and it is easily well I can't

00:00:27.430 --> 00:00:28.800 
obviously and it is easily well I can't
say<00:00:27.790> that<00:00:27.820> I<00:00:28.000> was<00:00:28.090> gonna<00:00:28.210> say<00:00:28.360> it's<00:00:28.480> easily<00:00:28.720> the

00:00:28.800 --> 00:00:28.810 
say that I was gonna say it's easily the

00:00:28.810 --> 00:00:30.540 
say that I was gonna say it's easily the
worst<00:00:28.930> of<00:00:29.260> the<00:00:29.380> bunch<00:00:29.410> but<00:00:29.890> then<00:00:30.040> rocket

00:00:30.540 --> 00:00:30.550 
worst of the bunch but then rocket

00:00:30.550 --> 00:00:32.700 
worst of the bunch but then rocket
wasn't<00:00:30.910> all<00:00:31.000> that<00:00:31.030> great<00:00:31.360> this<00:00:31.900> figure<00:00:32.320> action

00:00:32.700 --> 00:00:32.710 
wasn't all that great this figure action

00:00:32.710 --> 00:00:34.680 
wasn't all that great this figure action
does<00:00:32.890> some<00:00:33.100> things<00:00:33.129> very<00:00:33.760> well<00:00:33.879> but<00:00:34.600> it

00:00:34.680 --> 00:00:34.690 
does some things very well but it

00:00:34.690 --> 00:00:37.830 
does some things very well but it
doesn't<00:00:34.960> think<00:00:35.110> very<00:00:35.200> very<00:00:35.710> horribly<00:00:36.570> also<00:00:37.570> so

00:00:37.830 --> 00:00:37.840 
doesn't think very very horribly also so

00:00:37.840 --> 00:00:39.150 
doesn't think very very horribly also so
I<00:00:37.870> guess<00:00:37.960> we'll<00:00:38.199> just<00:00:38.230> get<00:00:38.470> into<00:00:38.710> and<00:00:38.890> go<00:00:39.010> from

00:00:39.150 --> 00:00:39.160 
I guess we'll just get into and go from

00:00:39.160 --> 00:00:43.710 
I guess we'll just get into and go from
there<00:00:39.340> she<00:00:39.970> stands<00:00:41.940> mmm<00:00:42.940> about<00:00:43.270> six<00:00:43.540> in<00:00:43.629> an

00:00:43.710 --> 00:00:43.720 
there she stands mmm about six in an

00:00:43.720 --> 00:00:45.990 
there she stands mmm about six in an
eighth<00:00:43.930> inches<00:00:44.320> tall<00:00:44.589> the<00:00:45.190> paint<00:00:45.489> on<00:00:45.760> this

00:00:45.990 --> 00:00:46.000 
eighth inches tall the paint on this

00:00:46.000 --> 00:00:48.990 
eighth inches tall the paint on this
figure<00:00:46.390> is<00:00:46.629> actually<00:00:47.589> pretty<00:00:47.890> good<00:00:48.190> I<00:00:48.489> like

00:00:48.990 --> 00:00:49.000 
figure is actually pretty good I like

00:00:49.000 --> 00:00:50.610 
figure is actually pretty good I like
the<00:00:49.180> way<00:00:49.300> they<00:00:49.479> painted<00:00:49.839> the<00:00:49.960> collar<00:00:50.229> the

00:00:50.610 --> 00:00:50.620 
the way they painted the collar the

00:00:50.620 --> 00:00:52.619 
the way they painted the collar the
little<00:00:50.860> hexagons<00:00:51.699> on<00:00:51.940> there<00:00:52.210> and<00:00:52.330> then<00:00:52.420> all

00:00:52.619 --> 00:00:52.629 
little hexagons on there and then all

00:00:52.629 --> 00:00:54.090 
little hexagons on there and then all
the<00:00:52.659> blue<00:00:53.019> streaking<00:00:53.559> throughout<00:00:53.920> the

00:00:54.090 --> 00:00:54.100 
the blue streaking throughout the

00:00:54.100 --> 00:00:56.490 
the blue streaking throughout the
uniform<00:00:54.640> it<00:00:55.239> actually<00:00:55.449> looks<00:00:55.780> really<00:00:55.839> good<00:00:56.260> we

00:00:56.490 --> 00:00:56.500 
uniform it actually looks really good we

00:00:56.500 --> 00:00:58.380 
uniform it actually looks really good we
have<00:00:56.680> variations<00:00:57.370> between<00:00:57.489> the<00:00:57.850> flat<00:00:58.089> black

00:00:58.380 --> 00:00:58.390 
have variations between the flat black

00:00:58.390 --> 00:01:01.140 
have variations between the flat black
and<00:00:58.720> the<00:00:59.379> glossy<00:00:59.890> black<00:01:00.129> so<00:01:00.699> that<00:01:00.879> looks

00:01:01.140 --> 00:01:01.150 
and the glossy black so that looks

00:01:01.150 --> 00:01:03.570 
and the glossy black so that looks
really<00:01:01.360> good<00:01:01.479> the<00:01:02.409> quality<00:01:02.979> of<00:01:03.010> the<00:01:03.370> page

00:01:03.570 --> 00:01:03.580 
really good the quality of the page

00:01:03.580 --> 00:01:05.930 
really good the quality of the page
application<00:01:04.239> on<00:01:04.390> the<00:01:04.510> face<00:01:04.720> also<00:01:05.320> really<00:01:05.650> good

00:01:05.930 --> 00:01:05.940 
application on the face also really good

00:01:05.940 --> 00:01:09.330 
application on the face also really good
the<00:01:06.940> shading<00:01:07.270> on<00:01:07.330> the<00:01:07.390> hair<00:01:07.750> really<00:01:08.409> good<00:01:08.770> so

00:01:09.330 --> 00:01:09.340 
the shading on the hair really good so

00:01:09.340 --> 00:01:11.640 
the shading on the hair really good so
the<00:01:09.490> paint<00:01:09.729> might<00:01:10.120> be<00:01:10.360> the<00:01:10.540> strongest<00:01:11.170> feature

00:01:11.640 --> 00:01:11.650 
the paint might be the strongest feature

00:01:11.650 --> 00:01:14.130 
the paint might be the strongest feature
of<00:01:12.040> this<00:01:12.460> figure<00:01:12.880> in<00:01:13.120> fact<00:01:13.659> i<00:01:13.780> think<00:01:13.810> they<00:01:14.110> are

00:01:14.130 --> 00:01:14.140 
of this figure in fact i think they are

00:01:14.140 --> 00:01:17.609 
of this figure in fact i think they are
quite<00:01:14.650> by<00:01:15.159> a<00:01:15.190> lot<00:01:15.570> the<00:01:16.570> articulation<00:01:17.229> is<00:01:17.320> okay

00:01:17.609 --> 00:01:17.619 
quite by a lot the articulation is okay

00:01:17.619 --> 00:01:18.929 
quite by a lot the articulation is okay
here<00:01:17.860> and<00:01:17.979> there<00:01:18.130> and<00:01:18.310> really<00:01:18.520> bad<00:01:18.670> in<00:01:18.820> some

00:01:18.929 --> 00:01:18.939 
here and there and really bad in some

00:01:18.939 --> 00:01:21.450 
here and there and really bad in some
other<00:01:19.060> places<00:01:19.390> so<00:01:19.750> let's<00:01:19.930> get<00:01:20.049> into<00:01:20.229> that<00:01:20.469> the

00:01:21.450 --> 00:01:21.460 
other places so let's get into that the

00:01:21.460 --> 00:01:26.310 
other places so let's get into that the
head<00:01:22.649> no<00:01:23.649> hinge<00:01:24.189> it's<00:01:24.579> just<00:01:24.880> a<00:01:24.969> ball<00:01:25.630> peg<00:01:25.930> which

00:01:26.310 --> 00:01:26.320 
head no hinge it's just a ball peg which

00:01:26.320 --> 00:01:29.069 
head no hinge it's just a ball peg which
means<00:01:26.649> all<00:01:27.009> we<00:01:27.789> get<00:01:27.939> is<00:01:28.149> a<00:01:28.210> swivel<00:01:28.719> there's<00:01:28.930> no

00:01:29.069 --> 00:01:29.079 
means all we get is a swivel there's no

00:01:29.079 --> 00:01:31.440 
means all we get is a swivel there's no
up<00:01:29.320> and<00:01:29.500> down<00:01:29.649> really<00:01:29.859> at<00:01:30.369> all<00:01:30.430> so<00:01:31.060> it's<00:01:31.240> just

00:01:31.440 --> 00:01:31.450 
up and down really at all so it's just

00:01:31.450 --> 00:01:32.940 
up and down really at all so it's just
the<00:01:31.570> swivel<00:01:31.990> and<00:01:32.140> the<00:01:32.229> hair<00:01:32.439> gets<00:01:32.560> in<00:01:32.740> the<00:01:32.829> way

00:01:32.940 --> 00:01:32.950 
the swivel and the hair gets in the way

00:01:32.950 --> 00:01:34.499 
the swivel and the hair gets in the way
for<00:01:33.159> that<00:01:33.280> so<00:01:33.430> the<00:01:33.520> head<00:01:33.670> can't<00:01:33.939> pose<00:01:34.210> very

00:01:34.499 --> 00:01:34.509 
for that so the head can't pose very

00:01:34.509 --> 00:01:37.349 
for that so the head can't pose very
well<00:01:34.750> at<00:01:34.960> all<00:01:35.229> ball<00:01:36.189> hinges<00:01:36.700> shoulders<00:01:37.180> with

00:01:37.349 --> 00:01:37.359 
well at all ball hinges shoulders with

00:01:37.359 --> 00:01:40.560 
well at all ball hinges shoulders with
no<00:01:37.539> biceps<00:01:38.049> whoa<00:01:38.229> those<00:01:38.560> work<00:01:38.829> okay<00:01:39.219> though<00:01:39.570> no

00:01:40.560 --> 00:01:40.570 
no biceps whoa those work okay though no

00:01:40.570 --> 00:01:42.480 
no biceps whoa those work okay though no
big<00:01:40.810> deal<00:01:40.960> we've<00:01:41.140> seen<00:01:41.320> that<00:01:41.469> before<00:01:41.649> we<00:01:42.340> do

00:01:42.480 --> 00:01:42.490 
big deal we've seen that before we do

00:01:42.490 --> 00:01:45.179 
big deal we've seen that before we do
have<00:01:42.609> the<00:01:42.700> biceps<00:01:43.119> swivel<00:01:43.450> in<00:01:43.600> the<00:01:43.750> elbow<00:01:44.200> it's

00:01:45.179 --> 00:01:45.189 
have the biceps swivel in the elbow it's

00:01:45.189 --> 00:01:46.830 
have the biceps swivel in the elbow it's
not<00:01:45.369> ideal<00:01:45.640> but<00:01:46.060> it's<00:01:46.240> something<00:01:46.390> we're<00:01:46.630> kind

00:01:46.830 --> 00:01:46.840 
not ideal but it's something we're kind

00:01:46.840 --> 00:01:48.359 
not ideal but it's something we're kind
of<00:01:46.929> used<00:01:47.140> to<00:01:47.259> at<00:01:47.380> this<00:01:47.500> point<00:01:47.619> we<00:01:47.950> do<00:01:48.070> have<00:01:48.250> the

00:01:48.359 --> 00:01:48.369 
of used to at this point we do have the

00:01:48.369 --> 00:01:52.410 
of used to at this point we do have the
hinge<00:01:48.609> they're<00:01:48.990> slightly<00:01:49.990> better<00:01:51.270> excuse<00:01:52.270> me

00:01:52.410 --> 00:01:52.420 
hinge they're slightly better excuse me

00:01:52.420 --> 00:01:55.080 
hinge they're slightly better excuse me
slightly<00:01:52.659> better<00:01:52.960> than<00:01:53.079> 90<00:01:53.560> degrees<00:01:53.820> but<00:01:54.820> it's

00:01:55.080 --> 00:01:55.090 
slightly better than 90 degrees but it's

00:01:55.090 --> 00:01:57.539 
slightly better than 90 degrees but it's
not<00:01:55.270> great<00:01:55.539> and<00:01:56.530> then<00:01:56.649> we<00:01:56.799> have<00:01:57.039> a<00:01:57.249> wrist

00:02:00.670 --> 00:02:02.399 
swivel and a wrist hinge which is pretty
good<00:02:00.909> that's<00:02:01.119> fine<00:02:01.390> so<00:02:01.659> far<00:02:01.869> I<00:02:01.929> choose<00:02:02.229> the

00:02:02.399 --> 00:02:02.409 
good that's fine so far I choose the

00:02:02.409 --> 00:02:04.260 
good that's fine so far I choose the
gripping<00:02:02.740> hands<00:02:03.070> on<00:02:03.219> both<00:02:03.490> sides<00:02:03.789> will<00:02:04.060> talk

00:02:04.260 --> 00:02:04.270 
gripping hands on both sides will talk

00:02:04.270 --> 00:02:06.179 
gripping hands on both sides will talk
about<00:02:04.390> those<00:02:04.689> in<00:02:04.749> a<00:02:05.170> minute<00:02:05.320> we<00:02:05.979> have<00:02:06.159> a

00:02:06.179 --> 00:02:06.189 
about those in a minute we have a

00:02:06.189 --> 00:02:08.850 
about those in a minute we have a
diaphragm<00:02:06.850> joint<00:02:07.240> for<00:02:07.569> her<00:02:07.780> torso<00:02:08.259> know<00:02:08.530> ab

00:02:08.850 --> 00:02:08.860 
diaphragm joint for her torso know ab

00:02:08.860 --> 00:02:11.910 
diaphragm joint for her torso know ab
crunch<00:02:09.340> or<00:02:09.580> waste<00:02:09.819> swivel<00:02:10.360> so<00:02:10.869> we<00:02:11.140> can<00:02:11.380> rotate

00:02:11.910 --> 00:02:11.920 
crunch or waste swivel so we can rotate

00:02:11.920 --> 00:02:14.280 
crunch or waste swivel so we can rotate
it<00:02:12.130> but<00:02:12.370> it<00:02:12.460> looks<00:02:12.670> really<00:02:13.540> horrible<00:02:14.110> so<00:02:14.260> i

00:02:14.280 --> 00:02:14.290 
it but it looks really horrible so i

00:02:14.290 --> 00:02:16.620 
it but it looks really horrible so i
don't<00:02:14.470> recommend<00:02:14.710> that<00:02:15.040> they<00:02:16.030> cannot<00:02:16.420> go

00:02:16.620 --> 00:02:16.630 
don't recommend that they cannot go

00:02:16.630 --> 00:02:19.290 
don't recommend that they cannot go
forward<00:02:16.900> at<00:02:17.350> all<00:02:17.380> so<00:02:18.130> that's<00:02:18.340> not<00:02:18.520> good<00:02:18.819> it

00:02:19.290 --> 00:02:19.300 
forward at all so that's not good it

00:02:19.300 --> 00:02:21.390 
forward at all so that's not good it
does<00:02:19.480> go<00:02:19.630> back<00:02:19.840> a<00:02:19.870> little<00:02:20.200> bit<00:02:20.470> and<00:02:20.710> then<00:02:20.770> it

00:02:21.390 --> 00:02:21.400 
does go back a little bit and then it

00:02:21.400 --> 00:02:23.370 
does go back a little bit and then it
does<00:02:21.610> lean<00:02:22.060> from<00:02:22.330> side<00:02:22.540> to<00:02:22.660> side<00:02:22.690> just<00:02:22.900> the

00:02:23.370 --> 00:02:23.380 
does lean from side to side just the

00:02:23.380 --> 00:02:24.900 
does lean from side to side just the
tiniest<00:02:23.650> little<00:02:24.190> bit

00:02:24.900 --> 00:02:24.910 
tiniest little bit

00:02:24.910 --> 00:02:27.060 
tiniest little bit
a whole<00:02:25.150> lot<00:02:25.360> though<00:02:25.740> one<00:02:26.740> thing<00:02:26.860> I<00:02:26.920> want<00:02:27.040> to

00:02:27.060 --> 00:02:27.070 
a whole lot though one thing I want to

00:02:27.070 --> 00:02:28.740 
a whole lot though one thing I want to
point<00:02:27.130> out<00:02:27.310> about<00:02:27.520> the<00:02:27.670> head<00:02:27.850> that<00:02:28.570> didn't

00:02:28.740 --> 00:02:28.750 
point out about the head that didn't

00:02:28.750 --> 00:02:30.120 
point out about the head that didn't
really<00:02:28.870> make<00:02:28.960> this<00:02:29.230> clear<00:02:29.560> is<00:02:29.650> that<00:02:29.680> she<00:02:29.920> can't

00:02:30.120 --> 00:02:30.130 
really make this clear is that she can't

00:02:30.130 --> 00:02:32.010 
really make this clear is that she can't
look<00:02:30.400> down<00:02:30.700> she's<00:02:31.060> always<00:02:31.360> kind<00:02:31.570> of<00:02:31.720> looking

00:02:32.010 --> 00:02:32.020 
look down she's always kind of looking

00:02:32.020 --> 00:02:34.470 
look down she's always kind of looking
up<00:02:32.170> in<00:02:32.560> the<00:02:33.160> painting<00:02:33.550> application<00:02:34.120> for<00:02:34.330> the

00:02:34.470 --> 00:02:34.480 
up in the painting application for the

00:02:34.480 --> 00:02:36.720 
up in the painting application for the
eyes<00:02:34.600> kind<00:02:35.140> of<00:02:35.290> lens<00:02:35.500> to<00:02:35.680> that<00:02:35.830> so<00:02:36.100> even<00:02:36.670> if

00:02:36.720 --> 00:02:36.730 
eyes kind of lens to that so even if

00:02:36.730 --> 00:02:38.310 
eyes kind of lens to that so even if
she's<00:02:36.910> technically<00:02:37.420> looking<00:02:37.870> straight<00:02:38.200> ahead

00:02:38.310 --> 00:02:38.320 
she's technically looking straight ahead

00:02:38.320 --> 00:02:40.230 
she's technically looking straight ahead
it<00:02:38.590> does<00:02:38.830> look<00:02:39.130> like<00:02:39.310> she's<00:02:39.550> looking<00:02:39.910> up<00:02:40.090> a

00:02:40.230 --> 00:02:40.240 
it does look like she's looking up a

00:02:40.240 --> 00:02:41.790 
it does look like she's looking up a
little<00:02:40.510> bit<00:02:40.660> so<00:02:40.900> that's<00:02:41.140> a<00:02:41.230> bit<00:02:41.410> of<00:02:41.500> a<00:02:41.560> problem

00:02:41.790 --> 00:02:41.800 
little bit so that's a bit of a problem

00:02:41.800 --> 00:02:44.340 
little bit so that's a bit of a problem
with<00:02:42.130> no<00:02:42.310> ab<00:02:42.580> crunch<00:02:42.970> and<00:02:43.210> no<00:02:43.570> forward<00:02:44.140> motion

00:02:44.340 --> 00:02:44.350 
with no ab crunch and no forward motion

00:02:44.350 --> 00:02:47.280 
with no ab crunch and no forward motion
on<00:02:44.740> the<00:02:44.920> head<00:02:45.210> this<00:02:46.210> belt<00:02:46.510> is<00:02:46.630> it<00:02:46.810> just<00:02:46.990> a<00:02:47.080> loose

00:02:47.280 --> 00:02:47.290 
on the head this belt is it just a loose

00:02:47.290 --> 00:02:50.700 
on the head this belt is it just a loose
piece<00:02:48.330> so<00:02:49.330> I<00:02:49.360> guess<00:02:49.540> that's<00:02:49.690> okay<00:02:50.050> there's<00:02:50.650> a

00:02:50.700 --> 00:02:50.710 
piece so I guess that's okay there's a

00:02:50.710 --> 00:02:52.170 
piece so I guess that's okay there's a
little<00:02:50.860> bit<00:02:50.980> of<00:02:51.040> paint<00:02:51.310> on<00:02:51.430> it<00:02:51.490> so<00:02:51.760> that's<00:02:51.940> fine

00:02:52.170 --> 00:02:52.180 
little bit of paint on it so that's fine

00:02:52.180 --> 00:02:54.270 
little bit of paint on it so that's fine
the<00:02:52.450> hips<00:02:52.690> on<00:02:52.900> the<00:02:53.020> other<00:02:53.200> hand<00:02:53.470> are<00:02:53.710> not<00:02:53.920> fine

00:02:54.270 --> 00:02:54.280 
the hips on the other hand are not fine

00:02:54.280 --> 00:02:56.670 
the hips on the other hand are not fine
I<00:02:54.660> guess<00:02:55.660> they've<00:02:55.810> sculpted<00:02:56.110> them<00:02:56.380> this<00:02:56.500> way

00:02:56.670 --> 00:02:56.680 
I guess they've sculpted them this way

00:02:56.680 --> 00:02:58.140 
I guess they've sculpted them this way
to<00:02:56.740> make<00:02:56.950> them<00:02:57.040> look<00:02:57.280> better<00:02:57.490> but<00:02:57.790> they<00:02:57.940> still

00:02:58.140 --> 00:02:58.150 
to make them look better but they still

00:02:58.150 --> 00:02:59.970 
to make them look better but they still
have<00:02:58.270> a<00:02:58.360> really<00:02:58.690> big<00:02:58.930> gap<00:02:59.170> in<00:02:59.200> there<00:02:59.680> so<00:02:59.890> they

00:02:59.970 --> 00:02:59.980 
have a really big gap in there so they

00:02:59.980 --> 00:03:02.250 
have a really big gap in there so they
don't<00:03:00.160> look<00:03:00.280> better<00:03:00.550> and<00:03:00.850> the<00:03:01.630> pose<00:03:01.810> ability

00:03:02.250 --> 00:03:02.260 
don't look better and the pose ability

00:03:02.260 --> 00:03:03.720 
don't look better and the pose ability
they<00:03:02.440> don't<00:03:02.620> come<00:03:02.860> forward<00:03:03.130> quite<00:03:03.490> all<00:03:03.640> the

00:03:03.720 --> 00:03:03.730 
they don't come forward quite all the

00:03:03.730 --> 00:03:05.280 
they don't come forward quite all the
way<00:03:03.760> but<00:03:03.880> that's<00:03:04.150> not<00:03:04.330> so<00:03:04.570> bad<00:03:04.600> they<00:03:04.960> do<00:03:05.020> go

00:03:05.280 --> 00:03:05.290 
way but that's not so bad they do go

00:03:05.290 --> 00:03:07.410 
way but that's not so bad they do go
backward<00:03:05.710> a<00:03:05.770> little<00:03:06.010> bit<00:03:06.130> so<00:03:06.280> that's<00:03:06.400> okay<00:03:06.850> but

00:03:07.410 --> 00:03:07.420 
backward a little bit so that's okay but

00:03:07.420 --> 00:03:10.860 
backward a little bit so that's okay but
they<00:03:07.540> don't<00:03:07.720> go<00:03:07.840> to<00:03:07.930> the<00:03:08.050> side<00:03:08.320> at<00:03:08.680> all<00:03:09.870> not

00:03:10.860 --> 00:03:10.870 
they don't go to the side at all not

00:03:10.870 --> 00:03:12.990 
they don't go to the side at all not
even<00:03:10.930> a<00:03:11.260> little<00:03:11.410> bit<00:03:11.560> so<00:03:12.070> that's<00:03:12.250> just<00:03:12.430> really

00:03:12.990 --> 00:03:13.000 
even a little bit so that's just really

00:03:13.000 --> 00:03:15.540 
even a little bit so that's just really
bad<00:03:13.360> design<00:03:13.840> it<00:03:14.230> doesn't<00:03:14.860> give<00:03:15.070> her<00:03:15.190> a<00:03:15.340> better

00:03:15.540 --> 00:03:15.550 
bad design it doesn't give her a better

00:03:15.550 --> 00:03:17.520 
bad design it doesn't give her a better
look<00:03:15.850> aesthetically<00:03:16.390> and<00:03:16.510> it's<00:03:17.020> not<00:03:17.200> good

00:03:17.520 --> 00:03:17.530 
look aesthetically and it's not good

00:03:17.530 --> 00:03:20.730 
look aesthetically and it's not good
practically<00:03:18.930> yeah<00:03:19.930> that's<00:03:20.260> we're<00:03:20.530> almost

00:03:20.730 --> 00:03:20.740 
practically yeah that's we're almost

00:03:20.740 --> 00:03:22.590 
practically yeah that's we're almost
going<00:03:21.010> back<00:03:21.310> to<00:03:21.520> the<00:03:21.640> days<00:03:21.850> of<00:03:22.060> the<00:03:22.180> toy<00:03:22.360> biz

00:03:22.590 --> 00:03:22.600 
going back to the days of the toy biz

00:03:22.600 --> 00:03:25.230 
going back to the days of the toy biz
robe<00:03:22.900> but<00:03:23.230> that<00:03:23.650> really<00:03:23.950> weird<00:03:24.460> slant<00:03:24.880> joint

00:03:25.230 --> 00:03:25.240 
robe but that really weird slant joint

00:03:25.240 --> 00:03:27.660 
robe but that really weird slant joint
and<00:03:25.620> Electra<00:03:26.620> had<00:03:26.830> it<00:03:26.980> too<00:03:27.130> it's<00:03:27.310> just<00:03:27.490> not

00:03:27.660 --> 00:03:27.670 
and Electra had it too it's just not

00:03:27.670 --> 00:03:29.760 
and Electra had it too it's just not
good<00:03:28.000> and<00:03:28.240> they<00:03:28.480> kind<00:03:28.810> of<00:03:28.930> it<00:03:29.530> kind<00:03:29.560> of

00:03:29.760 --> 00:03:29.770 
good and they kind of it kind of

00:03:29.770 --> 00:03:32.670 
good and they kind of it kind of
duplicated<00:03:30.370> that<00:03:30.490> so<00:03:30.820> no<00:03:31.240> bueno<00:03:31.570> we<00:03:32.530> have<00:03:32.650> a

00:03:32.670 --> 00:03:32.680 
duplicated that so no bueno we have a

00:03:32.680 --> 00:03:34.470 
duplicated that so no bueno we have a
thigh<00:03:32.920> swivel<00:03:33.310> here<00:03:33.550> which<00:03:33.700> is<00:03:33.850> really<00:03:34.240> nicely

00:03:34.470 --> 00:03:34.480 
thigh swivel here which is really nicely

00:03:34.480 --> 00:03:36.300 
thigh swivel here which is really nicely
hidden<00:03:34.780> so<00:03:34.990> I'm<00:03:35.050> fine<00:03:35.290> with<00:03:35.380> that<00:03:35.440> double

00:03:36.300 --> 00:03:36.310 
hidden so I'm fine with that double

good<00:03:38.040> the<00:03:39.040> ankle<00:03:40.260> where<00:03:41.260> we<00:03:41.440> took<00:03:41.590> a<00:03:41.650> step

00:03:41.730 --> 00:03:41.740 
good the ankle where we took a step

00:03:41.740 --> 00:03:43.800 
good the ankle where we took a step
backward<00:03:42.280> we<00:03:42.400> have<00:03:42.490> no<00:03:42.670> ankle<00:03:43.270> rocker<00:03:43.510> we<00:03:43.720> have

00:03:43.800 --> 00:03:43.810 
backward we have no ankle rocker we have

00:03:43.810 --> 00:03:46.080 
backward we have no ankle rocker we have
a<00:03:43.870> swivel<00:03:44.260> at<00:03:44.440> the<00:03:44.590> ankle<00:03:45.010> and<00:03:45.160> a<00:03:45.520> hinge<00:03:45.790> at<00:03:46.060> the

00:03:46.080 --> 00:03:46.090 
a swivel at the ankle and a hinge at the

00:03:46.090 --> 00:03:49.260 
a swivel at the ankle and a hinge at the
ankle<00:03:46.690> I<00:03:47.490> mean<00:03:48.490> it's<00:03:48.640> hidden<00:03:48.820> well<00:03:49.060> bye

00:03:49.260 --> 00:03:49.270 
ankle I mean it's hidden well bye

00:03:49.270 --> 00:03:51.090 
ankle I mean it's hidden well bye
because<00:03:49.900> of<00:03:50.020> this<00:03:50.140> little<00:03:50.470> sculpted<00:03:50.890> piece

00:03:51.090 --> 00:03:51.100 
because of this little sculpted piece

00:03:51.100 --> 00:03:53.310 
because of this little sculpted piece
there<00:03:51.400> but<00:03:51.730> we<00:03:52.150> have<00:03:52.270> no<00:03:52.420> ankle<00:03:52.690> rocker<00:03:52.959> so

00:03:53.310 --> 00:03:53.320 
there but we have no ankle rocker so

00:03:53.320 --> 00:03:55.680 
there but we have no ankle rocker so
that's<00:03:53.500> problematic<00:03:54.040> but<00:03:54.700> I<00:03:54.940> guess<00:03:55.180> it's<00:03:55.360> okay

00:03:55.680 --> 00:03:55.690 
that's problematic but I guess it's okay

00:03:55.690 --> 00:03:57.479 
that's problematic but I guess it's okay
since<00:03:55.989> her<00:03:56.170> legs<00:03:56.350> don't<00:03:56.560> work<00:03:56.680> anyway<00:03:57.160> you'll

00:03:57.479 --> 00:03:57.489 
since her legs don't work anyway you'll

00:03:57.489 --> 00:03:59.760 
since her legs don't work anyway you'll
never<00:03:57.700> need<00:03:57.880> to<00:03:57.940> use<00:03:58.060> it<00:03:58.450> so<00:03:58.600> I<00:03:59.080> don't<00:03:59.560> know

00:03:59.760 --> 00:03:59.770 
never need to use it so I don't know

00:04:19.860 --> 00:04:19.870 
look fine in the movie but as far as the

00:04:19.870 --> 00:04:22.110 
look fine in the movie but as far as the
legends<00:04:20.230> accessory<00:04:20.650> go<00:04:20.890> this<00:04:21.100> look<00:04:21.310> goes<00:04:21.790> this

00:04:25.530 --> 00:04:25.540 
looks pretty cheap and even worse she

00:04:25.540 --> 00:04:27.930 
looks pretty cheap and even worse she
can't<00:04:25.750> hold<00:04:26.050> it<00:04:26.200> I<00:04:26.440> mean<00:04:27.280> it<00:04:27.430> just<00:04:27.640> barely

00:04:27.930 --> 00:04:27.940 
can't hold it I mean it just barely

00:04:27.940 --> 00:04:29.880 
can't hold it I mean it just barely
stays<00:04:28.390> in<00:04:28.540> her<00:04:28.630> hand<00:04:28.930> if<00:04:29.140> you<00:04:29.440> don't<00:04:29.620> turn<00:04:29.770> her

00:04:29.880 --> 00:04:29.890 
stays in her hand if you don't turn her

00:04:29.890 --> 00:04:33.600 
stays in her hand if you don't turn her
upside<00:04:30.190> down<00:04:30.430> that's<00:04:31.210> it<00:04:31.480> if<00:04:32.440> you<00:04:33.130> hold<00:04:33.460> her

00:04:33.600 --> 00:04:33.610 
upside down that's it if you hold her

00:04:33.610 --> 00:04:35.190 
upside down that's it if you hold her
hand<00:04:33.820> just<00:04:34.120> like<00:04:34.300> that<00:04:34.479> the<00:04:34.510> gravity<00:04:35.050> will

00:04:35.190 --> 00:04:35.200 
hand just like that the gravity will

00:04:35.200 --> 00:04:37.990 
hand just like that the gravity will
keep<00:04:35.350> it<00:04:35.470> in<00:04:35.560> place<00:04:36.150> but<00:04:37.150> that's

00:04:37.990 --> 00:04:38.000 
keep it in place but that's

00:04:38.000 --> 00:04:39.580 
keep it in place but that's
good<00:04:38.180> and<00:04:38.300> even<00:04:38.510> on<00:04:38.600> this<00:04:38.780> side<00:04:38.960> it<00:04:39.110> on<00:04:39.260> it's

00:04:39.580 --> 00:04:39.590 
good and even on this side it on it's

00:04:39.590 --> 00:04:42.280 
good and even on this side it on it's
worse<00:04:39.860> on<00:04:40.490> this<00:04:40.850> side<00:04:41.090> so<00:04:41.750> if<00:04:41.810> you<00:04:41.900> want<00:04:42.080> her<00:04:42.170> to

00:04:42.280 --> 00:04:42.290 
worse on this side so if you want her to

00:04:42.290 --> 00:04:43.810 
worse on this side so if you want her to
actually<00:04:42.440> hold<00:04:42.770> it<00:04:43.010> you're<00:04:43.490> gonna<00:04:43.580> have<00:04:43.730> to

00:04:43.810 --> 00:04:43.820 
actually hold it you're gonna have to

00:04:43.820 --> 00:04:46.390 
actually hold it you're gonna have to
wedge<00:04:44.060> it<00:04:44.090> in<00:04:44.300> their<00:04:44.830> kind<00:04:45.830> of<00:04:45.950> up<00:04:46.070> where<00:04:46.280> the

00:04:46.390 --> 00:04:46.400 
wedge it in their kind of up where the

00:04:46.400 --> 00:04:49.990 
wedge it in their kind of up where the
hilt<00:04:46.640> is<00:04:46.990> set<00:04:47.990> the<00:04:48.110> hilt<00:04:48.350> or<00:04:48.530> the<00:04:48.680> whatever<00:04:49.580> the

00:04:49.990 --> 00:04:50.000 
hilt is set the hilt or the whatever the

00:04:50.000 --> 00:04:51.910 
hilt is set the hilt or the whatever the
thing<00:04:50.150> by<00:04:50.600> the<00:04:50.660> blade<00:04:51.050> you<00:04:51.530> have<00:04:51.620> to<00:04:51.740> wedge<00:04:51.890> it

00:04:51.910 --> 00:04:51.920 
thing by the blade you have to wedge it

00:04:51.920 --> 00:04:54.100 
thing by the blade you have to wedge it
in<00:04:52.100> there<00:04:52.310> so<00:04:52.460> that's<00:04:52.580> no<00:04:52.790> good<00:04:53.000> it's<00:04:53.630> just<00:04:53.840> I

00:04:54.100 --> 00:04:54.110 
in there so that's no good it's just I

00:04:54.110 --> 00:04:56.530 
in there so that's no good it's just I
don't<00:04:55.100> know<00:04:55.220> and<00:04:55.370> the<00:04:55.430> likeness<00:04:55.640> isn't<00:04:56.060> very

00:04:56.530 --> 00:04:56.540 
don't know and the likeness isn't very

00:04:56.540 --> 00:04:58.450 
don't know and the likeness isn't very
good<00:04:56.720> either<00:04:56.870> i<00:04:57.050> don't<00:04:57.140> think<00:04:57.530> so<00:04:57.620> it's<00:04:58.010> kind

00:04:58.450 --> 00:04:58.460 
good either i don't think so it's kind

00:04:58.460 --> 00:05:00.010 
good either i don't think so it's kind
of<00:04:58.490> a<00:04:58.580> letdown<00:04:58.760> of<00:04:59.090> a<00:04:59.180> figure<00:04:59.480> that<00:04:59.660> it<00:04:59.750> doesn't

00:05:00.010 --> 00:05:00.020 
of a letdown of a figure that it doesn't

00:05:00.020 --> 00:05:01.210 
of a letdown of a figure that it doesn't
like<00:05:00.110> I<00:05:00.200> said<00:05:00.350> does<00:05:00.470> a<00:05:00.500> lot<00:05:00.680> of<00:05:00.800> things<00:05:00.860> really

00:05:01.210 --> 00:05:01.220 
like I said does a lot of things really

00:05:01.220 --> 00:05:03.010 
like I said does a lot of things really
well<00:05:01.550> so<00:05:01.880> it's<00:05:02.030> kind<00:05:02.330> of<00:05:02.360> disappointing<00:05:02.540> that

00:05:03.010 --> 00:05:03.020 
well so it's kind of disappointing that

00:05:03.020 --> 00:05:04.450 
well so it's kind of disappointing that
the<00:05:03.080> other<00:05:03.380> things<00:05:03.650> it<00:05:03.770> does<00:05:03.920> so<00:05:04.100> poorly

00:05:04.450 --> 00:05:04.460 
the other things it does so poorly

00:05:04.460 --> 00:05:07.750 
the other things it does so poorly
really<00:05:05.270> detract<00:05:05.690> from<00:05:05.840> it<00:05:06.050> it's<00:05:06.830> really

00:05:07.750 --> 00:05:07.760 
really detract from it it's really

00:05:07.760 --> 00:05:09.160 
really detract from it it's really
disappointing<00:05:07.970> because<00:05:08.480> I<00:05:08.630> do<00:05:08.690> like<00:05:09.020> the

00:05:09.160 --> 00:05:09.170 
disappointing because I do like the

00:05:09.170 --> 00:05:10.780 
disappointing because I do like the
aesthetic<00:05:09.650> of<00:05:09.770> the<00:05:09.830> figures<00:05:10.250> probably<00:05:10.669> just

00:05:10.780 --> 00:05:10.790 
aesthetic of the figures probably just

00:05:10.790 --> 00:05:12.790 
aesthetic of the figures probably just
going<00:05:10.880> to<00:05:10.970> stand<00:05:11.210> there<00:05:11.390> so<00:05:12.320> I<00:05:12.350> guess<00:05:12.470> it's

00:05:12.790 --> 00:05:12.800 
going to stand there so I guess it's
