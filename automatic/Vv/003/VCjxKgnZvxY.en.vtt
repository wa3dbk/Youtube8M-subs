today<00:00:07.500> we're<00:00:07.620> going<00:00:07.710> to<00:00:07.799> be<00:00:07.890> talking<00:00:08.220> about

00:00:08.270 --> 00:00:08.280 
today we're going to be talking about

00:00:08.280 --> 00:00:10.400 
today we're going to be talking about
oils<00:00:08.940> so<00:00:09.150> we'll<00:00:09.269> be<00:00:09.389> talking<00:00:09.570> about<00:00:09.840> unhealthy

00:00:10.400 --> 00:00:10.410 
oils so we'll be talking about unhealthy

00:00:10.410 --> 00:00:12.080 
oils so we'll be talking about unhealthy
oils<00:00:10.800> and<00:00:11.010> then<00:00:11.130> using<00:00:11.490> healthy<00:00:11.880> oil

00:00:12.080 --> 00:00:12.090 
oils and then using healthy oil

00:00:12.090 --> 00:00:13.850 
oils and then using healthy oil
specifically<00:00:12.780> now<00:00:13.410> there's<00:00:13.559> a<00:00:13.620> lot<00:00:13.769> of

00:00:13.850 --> 00:00:13.860 
specifically now there's a lot of

00:00:13.860 --> 00:00:15.350 
specifically now there's a lot of
unhealthy<00:00:14.190> oils<00:00:14.730> out<00:00:14.849> there<00:00:14.910> you<00:00:15.150> want<00:00:15.299> to

00:00:15.350 --> 00:00:15.360 
unhealthy oils out there you want to

00:00:15.360 --> 00:00:17.450 
unhealthy oils out there you want to
stay<00:00:15.540> completely<00:00:15.990> away<00:00:16.350> from<00:00:16.379> some<00:00:17.310> of<00:00:17.369> those

00:00:17.450 --> 00:00:17.460 
stay completely away from some of those

00:00:17.460 --> 00:00:20.090 
stay completely away from some of those
oils<00:00:17.730> our<00:00:18.060> vegetable<00:00:18.690> oil<00:00:18.900> canola<00:00:19.529> oil

00:00:20.090 --> 00:00:20.100 
oils our vegetable oil canola oil

00:00:20.100 --> 00:00:22.040 
oils our vegetable oil canola oil
cottonseed<00:00:20.550> oil<00:00:21.000> anything<00:00:21.750> that<00:00:21.869> says

00:00:22.040 --> 00:00:22.050 
cottonseed oil anything that says

00:00:22.050 --> 00:00:24.439 
cottonseed oil anything that says
hydrogenated<00:00:22.980> oil<00:00:23.250> and<00:00:23.550> anything<00:00:24.240> that<00:00:24.269> would

00:00:24.439 --> 00:00:24.449 
hydrogenated oil and anything that would

00:00:24.449 --> 00:00:27.230 
hydrogenated oil and anything that would
say<00:00:24.630> trans<00:00:25.050> fats<00:00:25.410> on<00:00:25.710> it<00:00:25.830> basically<00:00:26.340> some<00:00:27.090> of

00:00:27.230 --> 00:00:27.240 
say trans fats on it basically some of

00:00:27.240 --> 00:00:29.060 
say trans fats on it basically some of
these<00:00:27.330> fats<00:00:27.720> used<00:00:27.990> to<00:00:28.080> be<00:00:28.199> real<00:00:28.500> fast<00:00:28.830> that

00:00:29.060 --> 00:00:29.070 
these fats used to be real fast that

00:00:29.070 --> 00:00:30.859 
these fats used to be real fast that
used<00:00:29.250> to<00:00:29.279> be<00:00:29.400> good<00:00:29.670> fat<00:00:30.000> and<00:00:30.300> they've<00:00:30.660> turned

00:00:30.859 --> 00:00:30.869 
used to be good fat and they've turned

00:00:30.869 --> 00:00:33.020 
used to be good fat and they've turned
into<00:00:31.019> bad<00:00:31.260> fat<00:00:31.590> so<00:00:31.830> something<00:00:32.399> like<00:00:32.430> vegetable

00:00:33.020 --> 00:00:33.030 
into bad fat so something like vegetable

00:00:33.030 --> 00:00:35.569 
into bad fat so something like vegetable
oil<00:00:33.270> it<00:00:33.570> may<00:00:34.050> use<00:00:34.290> to<00:00:34.410> be<00:00:34.559> part<00:00:34.860> of<00:00:34.920> a<00:00:35.040> vegetable

00:00:35.569 --> 00:00:35.579 
oil it may use to be part of a vegetable

00:00:35.579 --> 00:00:37.970 
oil it may use to be part of a vegetable
but<00:00:36.000> then<00:00:36.300> we<00:00:36.510> hydrogenated<00:00:37.500> it<00:00:37.559> and<00:00:37.710> turned

00:00:37.970 --> 00:00:37.980 
but then we hydrogenated it and turned

00:00:37.980 --> 00:00:40.819 
but then we hydrogenated it and turned
it<00:00:38.100> into<00:00:38.160> a<00:00:38.280> bad<00:00:38.520> fat<00:00:38.850> and<00:00:39.180> so<00:00:39.570> different<00:00:40.230> oils

00:00:40.819 --> 00:00:40.829 
it into a bad fat and so different oils

00:00:40.829 --> 00:00:43.069 
it into a bad fat and so different oils
have<00:00:41.040> different<00:00:41.489> heat<00:00:41.790> thresholds<00:00:42.540> and<00:00:42.660> so

00:00:43.069 --> 00:00:43.079 
have different heat thresholds and so

00:00:43.079 --> 00:00:46.250 
have different heat thresholds and so
most<00:00:43.680> oils<00:00:44.219> if<00:00:44.489> they're<00:00:44.820> heated<00:00:45.300> up<00:00:45.480> it'll

00:00:46.250 --> 00:00:46.260 
most oils if they're heated up it'll

00:00:46.260 --> 00:00:47.779 
most oils if they're heated up it'll
actually<00:00:46.350> change<00:00:46.590> their<00:00:47.160> molecular

00:00:47.779 --> 00:00:47.789 
actually change their molecular

00:00:47.789 --> 00:00:50.240 
actually change their molecular
structure<00:00:48.360> so<00:00:48.660> you<00:00:48.719> can<00:00:48.960> take<00:00:49.140> a<00:00:49.170> good<00:00:49.559> fat<00:00:49.950> and

00:00:50.240 --> 00:00:50.250 
structure so you can take a good fat and

00:00:50.250 --> 00:00:52.939 
structure so you can take a good fat and
actually<00:00:51.120> turn<00:00:51.390> it<00:00:51.539> into<00:00:51.660> a<00:00:51.750> bad<00:00:52.020> fat<00:00:52.379> by

00:00:52.939 --> 00:00:52.949 
actually turn it into a bad fat by

00:00:52.949 --> 00:00:54.709 
actually turn it into a bad fat by
heating<00:00:53.309> it<00:00:53.550> up<00:00:53.670> in<00:00:53.850> that<00:00:53.969> process<00:00:54.329> is

00:00:54.709 --> 00:00:54.719 
heating it up in that process is

00:00:54.719 --> 00:00:58.010 
heating it up in that process is
typically<00:00:55.079> called<00:00:55.730> oxidation<00:00:56.730> oxidation<00:00:57.270> is

00:00:58.010 --> 00:00:58.020 
typically called oxidation oxidation is

00:00:58.020 --> 00:00:59.689 
typically called oxidation oxidation is
let's<00:00:58.320> say<00:00:58.469> if<00:00:58.559> I<00:00:58.649> took<00:00:58.710> a<00:00:58.829> big<00:00:59.070> bite<00:00:59.309> out<00:00:59.340> of<00:00:59.489> an

00:00:59.689 --> 00:00:59.699 
let's say if I took a big bite out of an

00:00:59.699 --> 00:01:01.549 
let's say if I took a big bite out of an
apple<00:00:59.850> you<00:01:00.030> would<00:01:00.149> see<00:01:00.239> that<00:01:00.359> Brown<00:01:00.719> happening

00:01:01.549 --> 00:01:01.559 
apple you would see that Brown happening

00:01:01.559 --> 00:01:03.349 
apple you would see that Brown happening
to<00:01:01.649> the<00:01:01.739> Apple<00:01:02.129> it<00:01:02.430> would<00:01:02.579> start<00:01:02.699> to<00:01:02.789> decay<00:01:03.180> and

00:01:03.349 --> 00:01:03.359 
to the Apple it would start to decay and

00:01:03.359 --> 00:01:05.329 
to the Apple it would start to decay and
right<00:01:03.510> same<00:01:04.080> things<00:01:04.350> can<00:01:04.650> happen<00:01:04.830> to<00:01:04.979> oils

00:01:05.329 --> 00:01:05.339 
right same things can happen to oils

00:01:05.339 --> 00:01:07.730 
right same things can happen to oils
over<00:01:05.519> time<00:01:05.820> they<00:01:05.939> can<00:01:06.000> go<00:01:06.210> rancid<00:01:06.840> also<00:01:07.560> known

00:01:07.730 --> 00:01:07.740 
over time they can go rancid also known

00:01:07.740 --> 00:01:10.490 
over time they can go rancid also known
as<00:01:07.860> oxidation<00:01:08.580> and<00:01:08.970> most<00:01:09.570> the<00:01:09.750> oils<00:01:10.140> used<00:01:10.350> it

00:01:10.490 --> 00:01:10.500 
as oxidation and most the oils used it

00:01:10.500 --> 00:01:11.719 
as oxidation and most the oils used it
if<00:01:10.590> you<00:01:10.710> ever<00:01:10.799> go<00:01:10.979> to<00:01:11.010> a<00:01:11.159> fast<00:01:11.430> food<00:01:11.670> restaurant

00:01:11.719 --> 00:01:11.729 
if you ever go to a fast food restaurant

00:01:11.729 --> 00:01:14.179 
if you ever go to a fast food restaurant
if<00:01:12.510> you're<00:01:12.869> using<00:01:13.020> canola<00:01:13.470> oil<00:01:13.799> or<00:01:13.979> vegetable

00:01:14.179 --> 00:01:14.189 
if you're using canola oil or vegetable

00:01:14.189 --> 00:01:16.399 
if you're using canola oil or vegetable
oil<00:01:14.520> in<00:01:14.640> your<00:01:14.790> house<00:01:15.060> if<00:01:15.630> you<00:01:15.780> get<00:01:15.930> a<00:01:15.960> bottle<00:01:16.170> of

00:01:16.399 --> 00:01:16.409 
oil in your house if you get a bottle of

00:01:16.409 --> 00:01:18.530 
oil in your house if you get a bottle of
salad<00:01:16.680> dressing<00:01:16.920> it<00:01:17.369> says<00:01:17.549> soybean<00:01:18.000> oil<00:01:18.210> on<00:01:18.390> it

00:01:18.530 --> 00:01:18.540 
salad dressing it says soybean oil on it

00:01:18.540 --> 00:01:20.899 
salad dressing it says soybean oil on it
all<00:01:18.720> those<00:01:19.200> oils<00:01:19.409> are<00:01:19.650> oxidized<00:01:20.369> which<00:01:20.700> means

00:01:20.899 --> 00:01:20.909 
all those oils are oxidized which means

00:01:20.909 --> 00:01:23.960 
all those oils are oxidized which means
there's<00:01:21.119> a<00:01:21.210> rancid<00:01:21.780> they're<00:01:22.140> bad<00:01:22.439> fat<00:01:22.860> and<00:01:23.850> it

00:01:23.960 --> 00:01:23.970 
there's a rancid they're bad fat and it

00:01:23.970 --> 00:01:25.640 
there's a rancid they're bad fat and it
is<00:01:24.090> so<00:01:24.479> important<00:01:25.080> that<00:01:25.110> you're<00:01:25.290> getting<00:01:25.560> the

00:01:25.640 --> 00:01:25.650 
is so important that you're getting the

00:01:25.650 --> 00:01:27.230 
is so important that you're getting the
right<00:01:25.770> sort<00:01:26.040> of<00:01:26.130> fats<00:01:26.369> and<00:01:26.549> oils<00:01:26.820> in<00:01:26.909> your<00:01:27.030> body

00:01:27.230 --> 00:01:27.240 
right sort of fats and oils in your body

00:01:27.240 --> 00:01:30.140 
right sort of fats and oils in your body
because<00:01:27.869> every<00:01:28.710> cell<00:01:29.100> in<00:01:29.250> your<00:01:29.280> body<00:01:29.430> is<00:01:29.790> made

00:01:30.140 --> 00:01:30.150 
because every cell in your body is made

00:01:30.150 --> 00:01:32.179 
because every cell in your body is made
up<00:01:30.299> of<00:01:30.420> fat<00:01:30.659> your<00:01:31.350> ever<00:01:31.530> your<00:01:31.740> cells<00:01:32.009> have

00:01:32.179 --> 00:01:32.189 
up of fat your ever your cells have

00:01:32.189 --> 00:01:34.039 
up of fat your ever your cells have
what's<00:01:32.340> called<00:01:32.520> a<00:01:32.579> lipid<00:01:32.909> bilayer<00:01:33.360> so<00:01:33.930> in

00:01:34.039 --> 00:01:34.049 
what's called a lipid bilayer so in

00:01:34.049 --> 00:01:36.050 
what's called a lipid bilayer so in
order<00:01:34.320> for<00:01:34.530> you<00:01:34.710> to<00:01:34.860> be<00:01:34.950> healthy<00:01:35.189> you've<00:01:35.850> got

00:01:36.050 --> 00:01:36.060 
order for you to be healthy you've got

00:01:36.060 --> 00:01:37.880 
order for you to be healthy you've got
to<00:01:36.210> have<00:01:36.299> good<00:01:36.479> fats<00:01:36.750> in<00:01:36.960> your<00:01:36.990> body<00:01:37.259> and<00:01:37.500> so

00:01:37.880 --> 00:01:37.890 
to have good fats in your body and so

00:01:37.890 --> 00:01:39.440

a very low heat

00:02:11.480 --> 00:02:14.470 
a very low heat
eat<00:02:11.569> because<00:02:12.379> olive<00:02:13.190> oil<00:02:13.400> will<00:02:13.640> oxidize<00:02:13.909> and

00:02:14.470 --> 00:02:14.480 
eat because olive oil will oxidize and

00:02:14.480 --> 00:02:16.809 
eat because olive oil will oxidize and
become<00:02:14.690> a<00:02:14.720> bad<00:02:15.080> fat<00:02:15.470> if<00:02:15.769> you<00:02:16.190> heat<00:02:16.400> it<00:02:16.430> up<00:02:16.610> too

00:02:16.809 --> 00:02:16.819 
become a bad fat if you heat it up too

00:02:16.819 --> 00:02:18.339 
become a bad fat if you heat it up too
much<00:02:16.970> and<00:02:17.209> so<00:02:17.299> if<00:02:17.390> your<00:02:17.540> if<00:02:17.690> you<00:02:17.810> start<00:02:18.080> to<00:02:18.170> see

00:02:24.640 --> 00:02:24.650 
its oxidizing you don't want to get at

00:02:24.650 --> 00:02:26.170 
its oxidizing you don't want to get at
that<00:02:24.799> hot<00:02:25.069> but<00:02:25.370> again<00:02:25.580> olive<00:02:25.970> oil

cold-pressed means that again they just
pressed<00:02:28.819> it<00:02:28.970> it<00:02:29.090> was<00:02:29.209> cool<00:02:29.480> at<00:02:29.660> the<00:02:29.780> time<00:02:29.810> so<00:02:30.560> it

00:02:30.670 --> 00:02:30.680 
pressed it it was cool at the time so it

00:03:07.990 --> 00:03:08.000 
works better than olive oil with cooking

00:03:08.000 --> 00:03:10.539 
works better than olive oil with cooking
is<00:03:08.120> it<00:03:08.540> has<00:03:08.720> a<00:03:08.750> higher<00:03:09.109> heat<00:03:09.530> threshold<00:03:10.160> so

00:03:10.539 --> 00:03:10.549 
is it has a higher heat threshold so

00:03:10.549 --> 00:03:12.039 
is it has a higher heat threshold so
it's<00:03:10.670> not<00:03:10.819> going<00:03:10.970> to<00:03:11.060> oxidize<00:03:11.480> and<00:03:11.870> it<00:03:11.930> has

00:03:12.039 --> 00:03:12.049 
it's not going to oxidize and it has

00:03:12.049 --> 00:03:15.130 
it's not going to oxidize and it has
similar<00:03:12.500> properties<00:03:12.890> to<00:03:13.549> olive<00:03:14.209> oil<00:03:14.420> to<00:03:14.959> where

00:03:15.130 --> 00:03:15.140 
similar properties to olive oil to where

00:03:15.140 --> 00:03:16.930 
similar properties to olive oil to where
it's<00:03:15.290> an<00:03:15.410> Omega<00:03:15.799> 9<00:03:16.130> fats<00:03:16.160> as<00:03:16.910> a

00:03:16.930 --> 00:03:16.940 
it's an Omega 9 fats as a

00:03:16.940 --> 00:03:19.300 
it's an Omega 9 fats as a
monounsaturated<00:03:17.500> fat<00:03:18.500> which<00:03:18.980> a<00:03:19.099> lot<00:03:19.280> of

00:03:19.300 --> 00:03:19.310 
monounsaturated fat which a lot of

00:03:19.310 --> 00:03:20.680 
monounsaturated fat which a lot of
health<00:03:19.579> benefits<00:03:20.060> they're<00:03:20.209> good<00:03:20.450> for<00:03:20.599> your

00:03:20.680 --> 00:03:20.690 
health benefits they're good for your

00:03:20.690 --> 00:03:22.720 
health benefits they're good for your
joints<00:03:20.750> good<00:03:21.290> for<00:03:21.470> balancing<00:03:21.829> hormones<00:03:22.010> but

00:03:22.720 --> 00:03:22.730 
joints good for balancing hormones but

00:03:22.730 --> 00:03:24.339 
joints good for balancing hormones but
again<00:03:22.910> grapeseed<00:03:23.480> oil<00:03:23.720> is<00:03:23.780> one<00:03:23.900> of<00:03:23.989> the<00:03:24.049> number

00:03:24.339 --> 00:03:24.349
