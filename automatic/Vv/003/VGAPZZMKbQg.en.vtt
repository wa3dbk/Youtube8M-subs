00:00:05.480 --> 00:00:12.110
 hello friends today monday 

00:00:08.730 --> 00:00:17.519
 I'm going to work in the morning and in passing 

00:00:12.110 --> 00:00:21.330
 on duty in america i see what 

00:00:17.519 --> 00:00:23.579
 there is news of the latest which 

00:00:21.330 --> 00:00:26.369
 discussed in different sources 

00:00:23.579 --> 00:00:28.859
 more or less solid and here you 

00:00:26.369 --> 00:00:30.810
 telling it not to take and that i'm thin 

00:00:28.859 --> 00:00:33.170
 I understand the subject and whose 

00:00:30.810 --> 00:00:38.210
 I say, but I tell just what they write 

00:00:33.170 --> 00:00:40.680
 in particular, there was an interesting article yesterday 

00:00:38.210 --> 00:00:42.990
 in fox news 

00:00:40.680 --> 00:00:46.380
 they have a website so fox fox not 

00:00:42.990 --> 00:00:49.010
 clue and there was an interesting article about 

00:00:46.380 --> 00:00:49.010
 tom that 

00:00:49.070 --> 00:00:56.040
 Energy Commission starts 

00:00:51.930 --> 00:00:59.550
 consideration of export requests 

00:00:56.040 --> 00:01:02.090
 natural gas from the united states then 

00:00:59.550 --> 00:01:06.270
 we put in a couple of hundred projects 

00:01:02.090 --> 00:01:09.600
 On this subject and I think that in general 

00:01:06.270 --> 00:01:12.060
 natural resources this topic is interesting to those 

00:01:09.600 --> 00:01:14.520
 more than that there is a lot of talk there alone 

00:01:12.060 --> 00:01:18.030
 they say that there shale gas is all 

00:01:14.520 --> 00:01:20.729
 fiction and others say that nonetheless 

00:01:18.030 --> 00:01:22.729
 prices are falling mining rising profits and 

00:01:20.729 --> 00:01:26.160
 get ladies and so on therefore 

00:01:22.729 --> 00:01:29.690
 a story without getting out of details 

00:01:26.160 --> 00:01:32.009
 go deep is that 

00:01:29.690 --> 00:01:33.810
 gas producers want it 

00:01:32.009 --> 00:01:35.399
 export because there is a big 

00:01:33.810 --> 00:01:37.560
 demand and they liquid it 

00:01:35.399 --> 00:01:39.300
 want to supply other countries in 

00:01:37.560 --> 00:01:40.500
 particular japan exhibit big 

00:01:39.300 --> 00:01:45.259
 interest 

00:01:40.500 --> 00:01:47.880
 there are two negative aspect is that it 

00:01:45.259 --> 00:01:50.880
 which must be taken into account and 

00:01:47.880 --> 00:01:53.700
 there are lots of positive ones because if we 

00:01:50.880 --> 00:01:55.320
 increase production if we sell for 

00:01:53.700 --> 00:01:57.010
 milestone there prices are higher by the way than 

00:01:55.320 --> 00:01:59.680
 united states 

00:01:57.010 --> 00:02:00.880
 then we have more workers 

00:01:59.680 --> 00:02:03.070
 places and in that sense 

00:02:00.880 --> 00:02:04.420
 both parties and republican and 

00:02:03.070 --> 00:02:07.450
 Democratic senators and congressmen 

00:02:04.420 --> 00:02:11.220
 they are all very supportive 

00:02:07.450 --> 00:02:15.880
 writes that almost half of the country 

00:02:11.220 --> 00:02:18.930
 kansas tomato to new york stands here on 

00:02:15.880 --> 00:02:22.720
 some monstrous gas reserves there 

00:02:18.930 --> 00:02:24.640
 which somewhere lie there and that is 

00:02:22.720 --> 00:02:26.440
 you can have an incredible amount of everything there 

00:02:24.640 --> 00:02:29.230
 mine and the whole world there provide and 

00:02:26.440 --> 00:02:33.490
 so on but two negative aspects 

00:02:29.230 --> 00:02:35.860
 are that if we start less 

00:02:33.490 --> 00:02:37.290
 gas supply to the domestic market or 

00:02:35.860 --> 00:02:39.730
 somehow very much appear 

00:02:37.290 --> 00:02:42.370
 a trickle to the side then it may lead 

00:02:39.730 --> 00:02:46.240
 to increase the cost of gas inside 

00:02:42.370 --> 00:02:47.980
 countries and people write so well yes 

00:02:46.240 --> 00:02:50.770
 on the one hand can be like 

00:02:47.980 --> 00:02:52.860
 food on the other hand she doesn't care how 

00:02:50.770 --> 00:02:55.330
 would be nice then there is nothing like that 

00:02:52.860 --> 00:02:57.280
 disastrous departure badly in 

00:02:55.330 --> 00:03:01.890
 this is not the second aspect 

00:02:57.280 --> 00:03:06.850
 n ecological in our country as a whole 

00:03:01.890 --> 00:03:10.150
 ecologies are treated very carefully as well 

00:03:06.850 --> 00:03:12.519
 would i say and if something is clearly not 

00:03:10.150 --> 00:03:15.760
 a good cry will rise such that you already 

00:03:12.519 --> 00:03:17.830
 nothing wants to have states in which 

00:03:15.760 --> 00:03:20.320
 just and 

00:03:17.830 --> 00:03:21.040
 these people are for him like 

00:03:20.320 --> 00:03:23.530
 green 

00:03:21.040 --> 00:03:25.660
 who even when there and her special 

00:03:23.530 --> 00:03:27.760
 cause you no so shouted and 

00:03:25.660 --> 00:03:30.670
 warm up and there with initiative all the time 

00:03:27.760 --> 00:03:33.540
 California is one of those states wheeler-dealer 

00:03:30.670 --> 00:03:37.120
 ecology relationship just some kind of but 

00:03:33.540 --> 00:03:39.730
 i am even satisfied i live here myself but 

00:03:37.120 --> 00:03:40.350
 sometimes it seems that people are just 

00:03:39.730 --> 00:03:45.000
 goes wild 

00:03:40.350 --> 00:03:48.020
 they shout loudly and great 

00:03:45.000 --> 00:03:50.600
 in terms of production 

00:03:48.020 --> 00:03:52.600
 zhidkova at i apologize for mining 

00:03:50.600 --> 00:03:55.310
 this shale gas 

00:03:52.600 --> 00:03:59.390
 there are a lot of complaints 

00:03:55.310 --> 00:04:02.800
 again I am not a scientist I do not know 

00:03:59.390 --> 00:04:06.350
 nothing is absolutely connected with it 

00:04:02.800 --> 00:04:08.600
 Here they write that it is environmentally far from 

00:04:06.350 --> 00:04:10.190
 perfect mining method and there 

00:04:08.600 --> 00:04:12.110
 certain technologies that 

00:04:10.190 --> 00:04:16.600
 they are used as if not very 

00:04:12.110 --> 00:04:20.660
 good so it all goes in 

00:04:16.600 --> 00:04:22.580
 energy commission then it means 

00:04:20.660 --> 00:04:24.770
 will be at the president on the table so 

00:04:22.580 --> 00:04:26.780
 I understand, here it is necessary to see what it is 

00:04:24.770 --> 00:04:30.220
 process I will not say exactly now but 

00:04:26.780 --> 00:04:35.380
 in any case , the fact that 

00:04:30.220 --> 00:04:37.790
 process went and the united states of 

00:04:35.380 --> 00:04:41.780
 consumer and we we are enormous 

00:04:37.790 --> 00:04:43.850
 consumers and gas and oil and that's what 

00:04:41.780 --> 00:04:46.460
 we went out on self natural 

00:04:43.850 --> 00:04:49.780
 gas and what we are able it now 

00:04:46.460 --> 00:04:53.870
 export what's the next stage 

00:04:49.780 --> 00:04:55.310
 it is very very cool and now still 

00:04:53.870 --> 00:04:58.790
 writes that the same with oil 

00:04:55.310 --> 00:05:00.560
 will happen and we will that is still through 

00:04:58.790 --> 00:05:03.200
 few years we will cover our 

00:05:00.560 --> 00:05:05.480
 oil demand and a few more years 

00:05:03.200 --> 00:05:07.040
 we will start selling and still there 10 years 

00:05:05.480 --> 00:05:10.160
 today's packages we will 

00:05:07.040 --> 00:05:13.100
 the world's largest oil supplier to 

00:05:10.160 --> 00:05:17.330
 the global marketplace therefore this is also a topic 

00:05:13.100 --> 00:05:20.950
 interesting and difficult to say there 

00:05:17.330 --> 00:05:20.950
 where is science and where is speculation and 

00:05:21.280 --> 00:05:25.610
 I think over time there, too, under 

00:05:23.600 --> 00:05:28.250
 let's figure it out let's see because 

00:05:25.610 --> 00:05:31.820
 it is also very interesting topic as well here 

00:05:28.250 --> 00:05:35.860
 while I'm on duty again add up and 

00:05:31.820 --> 00:05:35.860
 going on other business
