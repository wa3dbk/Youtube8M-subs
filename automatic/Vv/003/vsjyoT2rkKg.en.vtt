00:00:19.390 --> 00:00:19.400 
the shows over the years and this is

00:00:19.400 --> 00:00:23.760 
the shows over the years and this is
quite<00:00:19.760> a<00:00:19.790> common<00:00:20.090> question<00:00:21.279> thing<00:00:22.279> is<00:00:22.430> with

00:00:23.760 --> 00:00:23.770 
quite a common question thing is with

00:00:23.770 --> 00:00:26.650 
quite a common question thing is with
with<00:00:24.770> brain<00:00:25.040> it<00:00:25.220> can<00:00:25.369> be<00:00:25.490> quite<00:00:25.730> expensive<00:00:25.760> and

00:00:26.650 --> 00:00:26.660 
with brain it can be quite expensive and

00:00:26.660 --> 00:00:30.279 
with brain it can be quite expensive and
so<00:00:26.960> in<00:00:27.560> our<00:00:27.950> personal<00:00:28.460> right<00:00:28.670> we<00:00:29.600> do<00:00:30.020> a<00:00:30.050> hundred

00:00:30.279 --> 00:00:30.289 
so in our personal right we do a hundred

00:00:30.289 --> 00:00:33.130 
so in our personal right we do a hundred
and<00:00:30.530> fifty<00:00:30.770> meters<00:00:31.100> all<00:00:31.629> this<00:00:32.629> helps<00:00:33.050> with

00:00:33.130 --> 00:00:33.140 
and fifty meters all this helps with

00:00:33.140 --> 00:00:34.689 
and fifty meters all this helps with
obviously<00:00:33.440> the<00:00:33.559> cost<00:00:33.830> but<00:00:34.160> the<00:00:34.309> problem<00:00:34.670> you

00:00:34.689 --> 00:00:34.699 
obviously the cost but the problem you

00:00:34.699 --> 00:00:36.549 
obviously the cost but the problem you
have<00:00:34.940> then<00:00:35.150> is<00:00:35.390> but<00:00:35.600> obviously<00:00:35.989> the<00:00:36.199> the

00:00:36.549 --> 00:00:36.559 
have then is but obviously the the

00:00:36.559 --> 00:00:38.229 
have then is but obviously the the
bride's<00:00:36.890> you've<00:00:37.100> got<00:00:37.340> will<00:00:37.550> not<00:00:37.699> fill<00:00:37.940> up<00:00:37.970> a

00:00:38.229 --> 00:00:38.239 
bride's you've got will not fill up a

00:00:38.239 --> 00:00:38.770

00:00:38.770 --> 00:00:38.780 
spa

00:00:38.780 --> 00:00:41.080 
spa
completely<00:00:39.170> so<00:00:39.739> this<00:00:39.890> is<00:00:40.040> how<00:00:40.190> I<00:00:40.250> actually

00:00:41.080 --> 00:00:41.090 
completely so this is how I actually

00:00:41.090 --> 00:00:45.760 
completely so this is how I actually
load<00:00:41.449> a<00:00:41.480> spawn<00:00:43.449> first<00:00:44.449> of<00:00:44.629> all<00:00:44.750> what<00:00:44.960> I<00:00:44.989> do<00:00:45.080> is<00:00:45.559> I

00:00:45.760 --> 00:00:45.770 
load a spawn first of all what I do is I

00:00:45.770 --> 00:00:50.790 
load a spawn first of all what I do is I
get<00:00:45.829> the<00:00:46.700> submerge<00:00:47.120> in<00:00:47.360> this<00:00:47.510> case<00:00:47.800> this<00:00:48.800> is<00:00:48.980> a

00:00:50.790 --> 00:00:50.800 
get the submerge in this case this is a

00:00:50.800 --> 00:00:56.110 
get the submerge in this case this is a
20-pound<00:00:51.800> sinking<00:00:52.309> bride<00:00:54.370> I'm<00:00:55.370> a<00:00:55.790> bleep<00:00:56.000> in

00:00:56.110 --> 00:00:56.120

00:01:01.900 --> 00:01:01.910 
water and then put it further tip so I

00:01:01.910 --> 00:01:07.749 
water and then put it further tip so I
did<00:01:02.149> the<00:01:02.480> buffering<00:01:02.930> on<00:01:03.399> my<00:01:04.399> rod<00:01:06.280> and<00:01:07.280> start<00:01:07.610> to

00:02:20.890 --> 00:02:24.520 

what<00:02:21.890> I<00:02:21.920> like<00:02:22.069> to<00:02:22.220> do<00:02:22.400> here<00:02:22.430> is<00:02:22.760> what<00:02:23.530> I'll

00:02:24.520 --> 00:02:24.530 
what I like to do here is what I'll

00:02:24.530 --> 00:02:32.850 
what I like to do here is what I'll
normally<00:02:24.739> use<00:02:25.069> for<00:02:25.100> like<00:02:25.430> a<00:02:25.459> shot<00:02:25.790> lead<00:02:26.000> or<00:02:26.180> not

00:02:32.850 --> 00:02:32.860 

00:02:32.860 --> 00:02:43.420 

just<00:02:33.860> trim<00:02:34.130> off<00:02:34.220> the<00:02:34.430> edges<00:02:34.550> I<00:02:42.310> promise<00:02:43.310> you

00:02:43.420 --> 00:02:43.430 
just trim off the edges I promise you

00:02:43.430 --> 00:02:45.009 
just trim off the edges I promise you
when<00:02:43.550> you<00:02:43.700> come<00:02:43.910> to<00:02:44.090> actually<00:02:44.390> spool<00:02:44.660> up<00:02:44.870> your

00:02:45.009 --> 00:02:45.019 
when you come to actually spool up your

00:02:45.019 --> 00:02:47.440 
when you come to actually spool up your
other<00:02:45.170> reels<00:02:45.940> it<00:02:46.940> won't<00:02:47.150> be<00:02:47.269> so

00:02:47.440 --> 00:02:47.450 
other reels it won't be so

00:02:47.450 --> 00:02:49.440 
other reels it won't be so
time-consuming

00:02:49.440 --> 00:02:49.450 
time-consuming

00:02:49.450 --> 00:02:54.220 
time-consuming
now<00:02:50.450> what<00:02:50.690> would<00:02:50.840> though<00:02:52.570> just<00:02:53.570> load<00:02:53.810> the<00:02:53.989> mono

00:02:54.220 --> 00:02:54.230 
now what would though just load the mono
