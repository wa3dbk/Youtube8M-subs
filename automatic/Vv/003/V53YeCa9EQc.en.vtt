but you know regardless of how I get
things<00:00:24.900> sit<00:00:25.170> there<00:00:25.380> it's<00:00:25.650> just<00:00:25.859> wobbly<00:00:26.340> you

00:00:26.839 --> 00:00:26.849 
things sit there it's just wobbly you

00:00:26.849 --> 00:00:30.849 
things sit there it's just wobbly you
know<00:00:27.050> if<00:00:28.050> you<00:00:28.949> disassemble<00:00:29.490> it<00:00:29.939> and<00:00:30.119> sit<00:00:30.449> the

00:00:30.849 --> 00:00:30.859 
know if you disassemble it and sit the

00:00:30.859 --> 00:00:33.500 
know if you disassemble it and sit the
just<00:00:31.859> the<00:00:31.949> blade<00:00:32.189> on<00:00:32.369> there<00:00:32.610> itself<00:00:33.000> it

00:00:33.500 --> 00:00:33.510 
just the blade on there itself it

00:00:33.510 --> 00:00:35.270 
just the blade on there itself it
wobbles<00:00:34.050> so<00:00:34.290> I<00:00:34.320> mean<00:00:34.500> I<00:00:34.559> know<00:00:34.590> that's<00:00:34.920> the

00:00:35.270 --> 00:00:35.280 
wobbles so I mean I know that's the

00:00:35.280 --> 00:00:38.060 
wobbles so I mean I know that's the
issue<00:00:35.489> it<00:00:35.730> just<00:00:35.940> don't<00:00:36.210> uh<00:00:36.649> don't<00:00:37.649> walk<00:00:37.860> in

00:00:38.060 --> 00:00:38.070 
issue it just don't uh don't walk in

00:00:38.070 --> 00:00:44.450 
issue it just don't uh don't walk in

00:00:44.450 --> 00:00:44.460 
there right so you know and I looked at

00:00:44.460 --> 00:00:47.900 
there right so you know and I looked at
a<00:00:44.489> review<00:00:44.910> on<00:00:45.510> YouTube<00:00:46.170> already<00:00:47.010> of<00:00:47.460> this<00:00:47.670> and

00:00:47.900 --> 00:00:47.910 
a review on YouTube already of this and

00:00:47.910 --> 00:00:49.250 
a review on YouTube already of this and
they<00:00:47.969> basically<00:00:48.239> say<00:00:48.510> the<00:00:48.600> same<00:00:48.629> thing<00:00:49.050> it's

00:00:49.250 --> 00:00:49.260 
they basically say the same thing it's

00:00:49.260 --> 00:00:51.220 
they basically say the same thing it's
difficult<00:00:49.800> to<00:00:49.890> tell<00:00:50.100> when<00:00:50.250> it's<00:00:50.280> locked<00:00:50.579> in

00:00:51.220 --> 00:00:51.230 
difficult to tell when it's locked in

00:00:51.230 --> 00:00:53.240 
difficult to tell when it's locked in
you're<00:00:52.230> supposed<00:00:52.500> to<00:00:52.559> make<00:00:52.710> sure<00:00:52.860> I<00:00:53.070> don't

00:00:53.240 --> 00:00:53.250 
you're supposed to make sure I don't

00:00:53.250 --> 00:00:54.560 
you're supposed to make sure I don't
know<00:00:53.309> if<00:00:53.399> you<00:00:53.520> can<00:00:53.610> see<00:00:53.760> but<00:00:53.879> there's<00:00:54.059> tabs<00:00:54.300> on

00:00:54.560 --> 00:00:54.570 
know if you can see but there's tabs on

00:00:56.029 --> 00:00:56.039 
here I'm supposed to get these lined up

00:00:56.039 --> 00:00:58.310 
here I'm supposed to get these lined up
with<00:00:56.160> these<00:00:56.309> tabs<00:00:56.670> but<00:00:57.660> it's<00:00:57.780> like<00:00:57.960> next<00:00:58.230> to

Goodwill so so this elixir if you
haven't<00:01:29.700> seen<00:01:30.409> the<00:01:31.409> video<00:01:32.840> I'll<00:01:33.840> just<00:01:34.020> take<00:01:34.229> a

00:01:34.249 --> 00:01:34.259 
haven't seen the video I'll just take a

00:01:34.259 --> 00:01:38.649 
haven't seen the video I'll just take a
ball<00:01:34.470> of<00:01:34.590> water<00:01:34.759> two<00:01:35.759> bananas

00:01:38.649 --> 00:01:38.659 

00:01:38.659 --> 00:01:42.950 

stalk<00:01:39.659> of<00:01:39.810> celery<00:01:41.420> can't<00:01:42.420> really<00:01:42.630> see<00:01:42.840> that

00:01:42.950 --> 00:01:42.960 
stalk of celery can't really see that

00:01:42.960 --> 00:01:46.069 
stalk of celery can't really see that
too<00:01:43.200> well<00:01:43.439> move<00:01:43.829> over<00:01:43.979> to<00:01:44.189> this<00:01:44.280> side<00:01:45.079> stock

00:01:46.069 --> 00:01:46.079 
too well move over to this side stock

00:01:46.079 --> 00:01:48.590 
too well move over to this side stock
celery<00:01:46.619> usually<00:01:47.369> I<00:01:47.430> use<00:01:47.460> a<00:01:47.640> whole<00:01:47.850> carrot<00:01:48.299> but

00:01:48.590 --> 00:01:48.600 
celery usually I use a whole carrot but

00:01:48.600 --> 00:01:50.990 
celery usually I use a whole carrot but
I'm<00:01:49.500> running<00:01:49.680> out<00:01:49.890> of<00:01:50.040> character<00:01:50.369> so<00:01:50.520> cutting

00:01:50.990 --> 00:01:51.000 
I'm running out of character so cutting

00:01:51.000 --> 00:02:00.469 
I'm running out of character so cutting
a<00:01:51.090> slim<00:01:51.360> now<00:01:54.110> I<00:01:57.560> got<00:01:58.939> roughly<00:01:59.939> a<00:02:00.030> couple<00:02:00.420> of

00:02:00.469 --> 00:02:00.479 
a slim now I got roughly a couple of

00:02:00.479 --> 00:02:02.389 
a slim now I got roughly a couple of
mixed<00:02:00.689> berries<00:02:01.079> blueberries<00:02:01.200> black<00:02:01.890> Patera

00:02:02.389 --> 00:02:02.399 
mixed berries blueberries black Patera

00:02:02.399 --> 00:02:04.609 
mixed berries blueberries black Patera
blackberries<00:02:03.180> and<00:02:03.270> raspberries<00:02:03.780> I<00:02:04.020> don't

00:02:04.609 --> 00:02:04.619 
blackberries and raspberries I don't

00:02:04.619 --> 00:02:07.249 
blackberries and raspberries I don't
measure<00:02:04.799> it<00:02:05.040> I<00:02:05.189> just<00:02:05.369> guess<00:02:05.840> looks<00:02:06.840> like<00:02:07.020> a<00:02:07.049> cup

00:02:07.249 --> 00:02:07.259 
measure it I just guess looks like a cup

00:02:07.259 --> 00:02:11.660 
measure it I just guess looks like a cup
to<00:02:07.409> me

00:02:11.660 --> 00:02:11.670 

00:02:11.670 --> 00:02:14.690 

looks<00:02:12.670> like<00:02:12.849> it'd<00:02:13.000> be<00:02:13.090> a<00:02:13.120> nice<00:02:13.330> blender<00:02:13.780> but

00:02:14.690 --> 00:02:14.700 
looks like it'd be a nice blender but

00:02:14.700 --> 00:02:18.720 
looks like it'd be a nice blender but
it's<00:02:15.700> roughly<00:02:16.450> $40<00:02:17.290> the<00:02:17.620> other<00:02:17.830> one<00:02:17.980> was<00:02:18.160> $5

00:02:18.720 --> 00:02:18.730 
it's roughly $40 the other one was $5

00:02:18.730 --> 00:02:22.260 
it's roughly $40 the other one was $5
good<00:02:19.030> well<00:02:19.209> it's<00:02:19.450> a<00:02:19.739> proctor<00:02:20.739> SIMEX<00:02:21.730> or<00:02:21.970> slim

00:02:22.260 --> 00:02:22.270 
good well it's a proctor SIMEX or slim

00:02:22.270 --> 00:02:26.010 
good well it's a proctor SIMEX or slim
ex<00:02:22.500> something<00:02:23.500> like<00:02:23.620> that<00:02:23.890> a<00:02:24.569> speed<00:02:25.569> blender<00:02:25.989> I

00:02:26.010 --> 00:02:26.020 
ex something like that a speed blender I

00:02:26.020 --> 00:02:29.220 
ex something like that a speed blender I
mean<00:02:26.350> it's<00:02:26.770> just<00:02:26.830> so<00:02:27.190> old<00:02:27.569> it<00:02:28.569> works<00:02:28.840> I<00:02:29.020> mean<00:02:29.050> it

00:02:29.220 --> 00:02:29.230 
mean it's just so old it works I mean it

00:02:29.230 --> 00:02:31.970 
mean it's just so old it works I mean it
leaks<00:02:29.440> at<00:02:29.620> the<00:02:29.680> bottom<00:02:30.010> but<00:02:30.190> it<00:02:30.280> works

00:02:31.970 --> 00:02:31.980 
leaks at the bottom but it works

00:02:31.980 --> 00:02:35.610 
leaks at the bottom but it works
