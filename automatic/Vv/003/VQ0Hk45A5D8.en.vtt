butter<00:01:18.869> in<00:01:19.170> it<00:01:19.380> but<00:01:19.710> it's<00:01:19.860> actually<00:01:20.340> really

00:01:20.630 --> 00:01:20.640 
butter in it but it's actually really

00:01:20.640 --> 00:01:23.149

tricky to mix subtle colors so I used a

00:01:23.159 --> 00:01:26.149 
tricky to mix subtle colors so I used a
combination<00:01:23.400> of<00:01:24.049> buttercup<00:01:25.049> yellow<00:01:25.080> gold<00:01:25.890> and
