 this indicates a very expensive fan 

00:03:57.270 --> 00:04:03.500
 and in there I just have to 

00:03:59.850 --> 00:04:08.250
 for example, a pencil sharpener in it or mine 

00:04:03.500 --> 00:04:12.959

00:04:15.450 --> 00:04:21.359
 I have good things in here 

00:04:19.080 --> 00:04:24.710
 for you actually for school 

00:04:21.359 --> 00:04:27.410
 I need you as part of one 

00:04:24.710 --> 00:04:29.790

00:04:36.510 --> 00:04:43.020
 my spring bag and now want 

00:04:41.180 --> 00:04:44.730

00:04:43.020 --> 00:04:46.440

00:04:46.440 --> 00:04:49.410
 see what I can about it 

00:04:47.850 --> 00:04:51.180
 So what did we say about it 

00:04:49.410 --> 00:04:53.730
 have told in our december 

00:04:51.180 --> 00:04:55.890
 favorites and since then I have stopped 

00:04:53.730 --> 00:04:57.270
 always a nail file min there is if 

00:04:55.890 --> 00:04:58.800
 Somehow grinding plant breaks off 

00:04:57.270 --> 00:05:00.660
 Just celebrate with it 

00:04:58.800 --> 00:05:02.220
 you like me does not bother and I do not 

00:05:00.660 --> 00:05:03.780
 right back to the fingernails but 

00:05:02.220 --> 00:05:06.750
 and that's why I have them too 

00:05:03.780 --> 00:05:10.080
 in the spring bag and yes that was now 

00:05:06.750 --> 00:05:13.170
 in my spring bag and then we come 

00:05:10.080 --> 00:05:15.000

00:05:13.170 --> 00:05:18.020

00:05:19.760 --> 00:05:26.700

00:05:23.790 --> 00:05:28.670

00:05:31.680 --> 00:05:34.550

00:05:33.450 --> 00:05:37.590
