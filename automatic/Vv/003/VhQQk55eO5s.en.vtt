top of color balance let me show you

00:01:20.590 --> 00:01:22.260 
top of color balance let me show you
what<00:01:20.740> I<00:01:20.770> mean<00:01:21.009> we'll<00:01:21.850> click<00:01:22.030> on<00:01:22.180> the

00:01:32.530 --> 00:01:35.069 
let's start off by making a little bit
of<00:01:32.649> an<00:01:32.740> S<00:01:32.920> curve<00:01:33.430> that<00:01:34.119> s<00:01:34.329> curve<00:01:34.750> is<00:01:34.869> going<00:01:35.020> to

00:01:35.069 --> 00:01:35.079 
of an S curve that s curve is going to

00:01:35.079 --> 00:01:38.160 
of an S curve that s curve is going to
give<00:01:35.530> me<00:01:35.799> some<00:01:36.009> nice<00:01:36.219> contrast<00:01:37.090> I<00:01:37.360> make<00:01:37.990> this

00:01:38.160 --> 00:01:38.170 
give me some nice contrast I make this

00:01:38.170 --> 00:01:40.380 
give me some nice contrast I make this
by<00:01:38.380> setting<00:01:38.680> a<00:01:38.860> point<00:01:39.130> up<00:01:39.280> top<00:01:39.520> clicking<00:01:40.000> up<00:01:40.240> a

00:01:40.380 --> 00:01:40.390 
by setting a point up top clicking up a

00:01:40.390 --> 00:01:40.889 
by setting a point up top clicking up a
little<00:01:40.539> bit

00:01:40.889 --> 00:01:40.899 
little bit

00:01:40.899 --> 00:01:42.359 
little bit
setting<00:01:41.380> a<00:01:41.439> point<00:01:41.680> down<00:01:41.890> near<00:01:42.100> the<00:01:42.189> bottom

00:01:42.359 --> 00:01:42.369 
setting a point down near the bottom

00:01:42.369 --> 00:01:45.060 
setting a point down near the bottom
clicking<00:01:43.060> down<00:01:43.240> next<00:01:44.079> and<00:01:44.259> I<00:01:44.680> go<00:01:44.829> to<00:01:44.890> my

00:01:45.060 --> 00:01:45.070 
clicking down next and I go to my

00:01:45.070 --> 00:01:47.190 
clicking down next and I go to my
different<00:01:45.250> channels<00:01:45.880> the<00:01:46.119> red<00:01:46.390> channel<00:01:46.840> I'm

00:01:47.190 --> 00:01:47.200 
different channels the red channel I'm

00:01:47.200 --> 00:01:48.959 
different channels the red channel I'm
going<00:01:47.320> to<00:01:47.380> really<00:01:47.649> bring<00:01:47.859> up<00:01:48.130> some<00:01:48.369> nice<00:01:48.579> red

00:01:48.959 --> 00:01:48.969 
going to really bring up some nice red

00:01:48.969 --> 00:01:51.179 
going to really bring up some nice red
they're<00:01:49.270> green<00:01:49.299> magenta<00:01:50.140> I'm<00:01:50.829> going<00:01:50.979> to<00:01:51.039> bring

00:01:51.179 --> 00:01:51.189 
they're green magenta I'm going to bring

00:01:51.189 --> 00:01:53.370 
they're green magenta I'm going to bring
in<00:01:51.340> some<00:01:51.369> magenta<00:01:52.119> and<00:01:52.270> then<00:01:52.509> on<00:01:52.659> top<00:01:52.930> of<00:01:52.990> all

00:01:53.370 --> 00:01:53.380 
in some magenta and then on top of all

00:01:53.380 --> 00:01:56.190 
in some magenta and then on top of all
of<00:01:53.439> this<00:01:53.829> in<00:01:54.100> that<00:01:54.729> blue<00:01:55.030> yellow<00:01:55.390> channel<00:01:55.780> I'm

00:01:56.190 --> 00:01:56.200 
of this in that blue yellow channel I'm

00:01:56.200 --> 00:01:57.899 
of this in that blue yellow channel I'm
going<00:01:56.439> to<00:01:56.500> go<00:01:56.619> ahead<00:01:56.710> and<00:01:56.920> bring<00:01:57.130> in<00:01:57.369> quite<00:01:57.880> a

00:01:57.899 --> 00:01:57.909 
going to go ahead and bring in quite a

00:01:57.909 --> 00:01:59.789 
going to go ahead and bring in quite a
bit<00:01:58.179> of<00:01:58.270> yellow<00:01:58.600> to<00:01:58.659> give<00:01:58.960> me<00:01:59.109> that<00:01:59.259> really

00:01:59.789 --> 00:01:59.799 
bit of yellow to give me that really

00:01:59.799 --> 00:02:01.859 
bit of yellow to give me that really
nice<00:02:00.009> golden<00:02:00.609> and<00:02:00.909> dramatic<00:02:01.420> and<00:02:01.600> for<00:02:01.780> that

00:02:01.859 --> 00:02:01.869 
nice golden and dramatic and for that

00:02:01.869 --> 00:02:04.590 
nice golden and dramatic and for that
matter<00:02:02.049> almost<00:02:02.289> cinematic<00:02:03.039> look<00:02:03.640> alright

00:02:04.590 --> 00:02:04.600 
matter almost cinematic look alright

00:02:04.600 --> 00:02:06.389 
matter almost cinematic look alright
well<00:02:04.750> let's<00:02:04.899> take<00:02:05.049> a<00:02:05.079> look<00:02:05.320> at<00:02:05.409> our<00:02:05.590> layers<00:02:06.009> to

00:02:06.389 --> 00:02:06.399 
well let's take a look at our layers to

00:02:06.399 --> 00:02:08.639 
well let's take a look at our layers to
see<00:02:06.579> how<00:02:06.729> this<00:02:06.880> particular<00:02:07.390> color<00:02:07.689> effect<00:02:08.110> was

00:02:08.639 --> 00:02:08.649 
see how this particular color effect was

00:02:08.649 --> 00:02:10.740 
see how this particular color effect was
built<00:02:08.890> up<00:02:09.130> we<00:02:09.789> go<00:02:09.940> ahead<00:02:10.090> and<00:02:10.210> click<00:02:10.390> off<00:02:10.570> the

00:02:10.740 --> 00:02:10.750 
built up we go ahead and click off the

00:02:10.750 --> 00:02:12.840 
built up we go ahead and click off the
eye<00:02:10.780> icon<00:02:11.230> on<00:02:11.650> the<00:02:11.860> curves<00:02:12.130> layer<00:02:12.340> here's<00:02:12.700> our

00:02:12.840 --> 00:02:12.850 
eye icon on the curves layer here's our

00:02:12.850 --> 00:02:15.140 
eye icon on the curves layer here's our
before<00:02:13.030> and<00:02:13.690> then

00:02:15.140 --> 00:02:15.150 
before and then

00:02:15.150 --> 00:02:16.699 
before and then
one<00:02:15.689> of<00:02:15.780> things<00:02:15.900> that's<00:02:15.989> interesting<00:02:16.260> about

00:02:16.699 --> 00:02:16.709 
one of things that's interesting about

00:02:16.709 --> 00:02:18.679 
one of things that's interesting about
this<00:02:17.129> is<00:02:17.189> that<00:02:17.459> when<00:02:17.640> we<00:02:17.790> turn<00:02:18.030> off<00:02:18.239> the<00:02:18.269> curves

00:02:18.679 --> 00:02:18.689 
this is that when we turn off the curves

00:02:18.689 --> 00:02:21.559 
this is that when we turn off the curves
layer<00:02:18.989> we<00:02:19.590> go<00:02:19.769> back<00:02:19.980> to<00:02:20.159> this<00:02:20.400> this<00:02:21.090> just<00:02:21.360> looks

00:02:21.559 --> 00:02:21.569 
layer we go back to this this just looks

00:02:21.569 --> 00:02:23.899 
layer we go back to this this just looks
like<00:02:21.750> it's<00:02:21.959> not<00:02:22.200> even<00:02:22.379> really<00:02:22.680> anything<00:02:23.069> yet

00:02:23.899 --> 00:02:23.909 
like it's not even really anything yet

00:02:23.909 --> 00:02:25.550 
like it's not even really anything yet
when<00:02:24.060> we<00:02:24.180> turn<00:02:24.360> off<00:02:24.480> the<00:02:24.510> visibility<00:02:24.840> of<00:02:25.290> color

00:02:25.550 --> 00:02:25.560 
when we turn off the visibility of color

00:02:25.560 --> 00:02:27.500 
when we turn off the visibility of color
balance<00:02:26.010> again<00:02:26.340> we<00:02:26.579> then<00:02:26.760> see<00:02:27.030> that<00:02:27.060> curves

00:02:27.500 --> 00:02:27.510 
balance again we then see that curves

00:02:27.510 --> 00:02:29.600 
balance again we then see that curves
actually<00:02:27.780> did<00:02:28.170> push<00:02:28.409> this<00:02:28.620> image<00:02:28.980> pretty<00:02:29.310> far

00:02:29.600 --> 00:02:29.610 
actually did push this image pretty far

00:02:29.610 --> 00:02:31.729 
actually did push this image pretty far
and<00:02:29.879> how<00:02:30.659> we<00:02:30.720> came<00:02:31.019> up<00:02:31.079> with<00:02:31.379> this<00:02:31.560> really

00:02:31.729 --> 00:02:31.739 
and how we came up with this really

00:02:31.739 --> 00:02:34.039 
and how we came up with this really
dramatic<00:02:32.010> color<00:02:32.640> was<00:02:33.390> to<00:02:33.569> kind<00:02:33.780> of<00:02:33.900> have<00:02:34.019> a

00:02:34.039 --> 00:02:34.049 
dramatic color was to kind of have a

00:02:34.049 --> 00:02:36.229 
dramatic color was to kind of have a
vision<00:02:34.470> for<00:02:34.890> it<00:02:35.010> from<00:02:35.129> the<00:02:35.220> get-go<00:02:35.489> and<00:02:35.940> then

00:02:36.229 --> 00:02:36.239 
vision for it from the get-go and then

00:02:36.239 --> 00:02:38.390 
vision for it from the get-go and then
begin<00:02:36.720> to<00:02:36.870> push<00:02:37.110> the<00:02:37.349> color<00:02:37.530> one<00:02:37.980> way<00:02:38.220> and

00:02:38.390 --> 00:02:38.400 
begin to push the color one way and

00:02:38.400 --> 00:02:40.369 
begin to push the color one way and
start<00:02:38.730> to<00:02:38.909> really<00:02:39.510> work<00:02:39.720> it<00:02:39.870> out<00:02:40.049> and<00:02:40.319> then

00:02:40.369 --> 00:02:40.379 
start to really work it out and then

00:02:40.379 --> 00:02:43.580 
start to really work it out and then
take<00:02:41.370> it<00:02:41.400> even<00:02:41.730> further<00:02:42.030> and<00:02:42.390> a<00:02:42.959> lot<00:02:43.230> of<00:02:43.260> times

00:02:43.580 --> 00:02:43.590 
take it even further and a lot of times

00:02:43.590 --> 00:02:45.649 
take it even further and a lot of times
when<00:02:43.890> working<00:02:44.189> with<00:02:44.459> color<00:02:44.760> you<00:02:44.970> have<00:02:45.209> to<00:02:45.239> have

00:02:45.649 --> 00:02:45.659 
when working with color you have to have

00:02:45.659 --> 00:02:47.720 
when working with color you have to have
that<00:02:45.900> persistence<00:02:46.769> that<00:02:46.950> endurance<00:02:47.340> that

00:02:47.720 --> 00:02:47.730 
that persistence that endurance that

00:02:47.730 --> 00:02:50.089 
that persistence that endurance that
patience<00:02:48.299> to<00:02:48.780> kind<00:02:49.049> of<00:02:49.140> see<00:02:49.470> an<00:02:49.590> image<00:02:49.859> through

00:02:50.089 --> 00:02:50.099 
patience to kind of see an image through

00:02:50.099 --> 00:02:51.860 
patience to kind of see an image through
and<00:02:50.879> you<00:02:50.940> have<00:02:51.060> to<00:02:51.150> keep<00:02:51.269> in<00:02:51.420> mind<00:02:51.450> that

00:02:51.860 --> 00:02:51.870 
and you have to keep in mind that

00:02:51.870 --> 00:02:54.379 
and you have to keep in mind that
working<00:02:52.409> on<00:02:52.560> photographs<00:02:53.159> really<00:02:53.670> is<00:02:53.879> an<00:02:54.239> art

00:02:54.379 --> 00:02:54.389 
working on photographs really is an art

00:02:54.389 --> 00:02:56.960 
working on photographs really is an art
and<00:02:54.780> a<00:02:54.870> craft<00:02:55.260> and<00:02:55.560> if<00:02:56.069> you<00:02:56.190> have<00:02:56.430> that<00:02:56.670> vision

00:02:56.960 --> 00:02:56.970 
and a craft and if you have that vision

00:02:56.970 --> 00:02:59.390 
and a craft and if you have that vision
many<00:02:57.420> times<00:02:57.720> you<00:02:58.290> can<00:02:58.440> come<00:02:58.769> up<00:02:58.799> with<00:02:59.190> some

00:02:59.390 --> 00:02:59.400 
many times you can come up with some

00:02:59.400 --> 00:03:02.900 
many times you can come up with some
really<00:02:59.819> stunning<00:03:00.269> results
