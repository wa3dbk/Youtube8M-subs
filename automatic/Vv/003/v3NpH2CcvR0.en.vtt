00:00:50.750 --> 00:00:50.760 
where to go so it's kind of tricky right

00:00:50.760 --> 00:00:52.220 
where to go so it's kind of tricky right
here<00:00:50.910> you<00:00:51.000> might<00:00:51.120> think<00:00:51.300> the<00:00:51.449> ledges<00:00:51.780> and<00:00:51.960> but

00:00:52.220 --> 00:00:52.230 
here you might think the ledges and but

00:00:52.230 --> 00:00:54.380 
here you might think the ledges and but
if<00:00:52.320> you<00:00:52.440> actually<00:00:52.620> drop<00:00:53.039> down<00:00:53.340> you<00:00:54.239> can

00:00:54.380 --> 00:00:54.390 
if you actually drop down you can

00:00:54.390 --> 00:00:56.510 
if you actually drop down you can
actually<00:00:54.570> just<00:00:54.840> look<00:00:55.050> around<00:00:55.170> and<00:00:55.620> explore<00:00:56.190> a

00:00:56.510 --> 00:00:56.520 
actually just look around and explore a

00:00:56.520 --> 00:00:58.670 
actually just look around and explore a
little<00:00:56.760> bit<00:00:57.030> but<00:00:57.719> in<00:00:57.930> a<00:00:58.020> second<00:00:58.320> I'll<00:00:58.410> show<00:00:58.620> you

00:00:58.670 --> 00:00:58.680 
little bit but in a second I'll show you

00:00:58.680 --> 00:01:01.990 
little bit but in a second I'll show you
where<00:00:59.039> you<00:00:59.309> can<00:00:59.340> actually<00:01:00.030> choose<00:01:00.539> the<00:01:01.020> Nexus

00:01:01.990 --> 00:01:02.000 
where you can actually choose the Nexus

00:01:02.000 --> 00:01:03.950 
where you can actually choose the Nexus
so<00:01:03.000> as<00:01:03.090> you<00:01:03.180> can<00:01:03.270> see<00:01:03.420> you<00:01:03.510> can<00:01:03.539> see<00:01:03.750> the<00:01:03.840> other

00:01:03.950 --> 00:01:03.960 
so as you can see you can see the other

00:01:03.960 --> 00:01:05.840 
so as you can see you can see the other
part<00:01:04.260> of<00:01:04.290> the<00:01:04.379> map<00:01:04.500> over<00:01:04.769> there<00:01:04.949> and<00:01:05.129> because

00:01:05.840 --> 00:01:05.850 
part of the map over there and because

00:01:05.850 --> 00:01:07.760 
part of the map over there and because
there's<00:01:05.939> a<00:01:06.090> little<00:01:06.180> tunnel<00:01:06.479> a<00:01:06.810> couple<00:01:07.560> little

00:01:07.760 --> 00:01:07.770 
there's a little tunnel a couple little

00:01:07.770 --> 00:01:08.990 
there's a little tunnel a couple little
secret<00:01:08.070> areas<00:01:08.400> and<00:01:08.520> it's<00:01:08.670> kind<00:01:08.790> of<00:01:08.820> confusing

00:01:08.990 --> 00:01:09.000 
secret areas and it's kind of confusing

00:01:09.000 --> 00:01:11.810 
secret areas and it's kind of confusing
where<00:01:09.360> you<00:01:09.420> go<00:01:09.630> but<00:01:09.840> to<00:01:10.530> get<00:01:10.650> tour<00:01:10.890> you<00:01:11.340> know<00:01:11.460> if

00:01:11.810 --> 00:01:11.820 
where you go but to get tour you know if

00:01:11.820 --> 00:01:12.950 
where you go but to get tour you know if
she's<00:01:12.000> a<00:01:12.030> nexus<00:01:12.450> you're<00:01:12.570> going<00:01:12.689> to<00:01:12.750> come<00:01:12.930> over

00:01:12.950 --> 00:01:12.960 
she's a nexus you're going to come over

00:01:12.960 --> 00:01:15.679 
she's a nexus you're going to come over
here<00:01:13.140> or<00:01:13.680> you<00:01:13.770> can<00:01:13.799> see<00:01:14.330> inside<00:01:15.330> the<00:01:15.509> actual

00:01:15.679 --> 00:01:15.689 
here or you can see inside the actual

00:01:15.689 --> 00:01:17.600 
here or you can see inside the actual
map<00:01:16.140> so<00:01:16.439> again<00:01:16.770> if<00:01:16.920> you<00:01:17.009> didn't<00:01:17.220> notice<00:01:17.369> the

00:01:17.600 --> 00:01:17.610 
map so again if you didn't notice the

00:01:17.610 --> 00:01:19.280 
map so again if you didn't notice the
first<00:01:17.880> time<00:01:18.119> it's<00:01:18.299> kind<00:01:18.450> of<00:01:18.479> confusing<00:01:18.659> when

00:01:19.280 --> 00:01:19.290 
first time it's kind of confusing when

00:01:19.290 --> 00:01:20.570 
first time it's kind of confusing when
you<00:01:19.380> go<00:01:19.530> in<00:01:19.680> there<00:01:19.799> because<00:01:20.070> there's<00:01:20.310> a<00:01:20.369> wall

00:01:20.570 --> 00:01:20.580 
you go in there because there's a wall

00:01:20.580 --> 00:01:22.070 
you go in there because there's a wall
right<00:01:20.610> here<00:01:20.790> so<00:01:21.180> you<00:01:21.270> probably<00:01:21.509> won't<00:01:21.659> see<00:01:21.960> it

00:01:22.070 --> 00:01:22.080 
right here so you probably won't see it

00:01:22.080 --> 00:01:24.350 
right here so you probably won't see it
and<00:01:22.409> it's<00:01:23.250> right<00:01:23.490> next<00:01:23.580> to<00:01:23.700> this<00:01:23.820> rock<00:01:24.119> you're

00:01:24.350 --> 00:01:24.360 
and it's right next to this rock you're

00:01:24.360 --> 00:01:25.670
