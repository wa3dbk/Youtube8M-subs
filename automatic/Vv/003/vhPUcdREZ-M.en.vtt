for bit they had a similar style capo to

00:00:38.430 --> 00:00:44.090 
for bit they had a similar style capo to
this<00:00:39.410> where<00:00:40.410> the<00:00:41.750> piece<00:00:42.750> that<00:00:43.140> pushes<00:00:43.770> against

00:00:44.090 --> 00:00:44.100 
this where the piece that pushes against

00:00:44.100 --> 00:00:45.619 
this where the piece that pushes against
the<00:00:44.160> back<00:00:44.550> of<00:00:44.579> the<00:00:44.850> neck<00:00:44.969> of<00:00:45.120> the<00:00:45.180> guitar<00:00:45.210> would

00:00:45.619 --> 00:00:45.629 
the back of the neck of the guitar would

00:00:45.629 --> 00:00:47.990 
the back of the neck of the guitar would
screw<00:00:46.110> forward<00:00:46.920> just<00:00:47.190> like<00:00:47.280> this<00:00:47.550> one<00:00:47.760> does

00:00:47.990 --> 00:00:48.000 
screw forward just like this one does

00:00:48.000 --> 00:00:52.760 
screw forward just like this one does
and<00:00:48.360> then<00:00:49.230> screw<00:00:50.039> to<00:00:50.160> release<00:00:51.530> and<00:00:52.530> it<00:00:52.620> also

00:00:52.760 --> 00:00:52.770 
and then screw to release and it also

00:00:52.770 --> 00:00:55.580 
and then screw to release and it also
has<00:00:53.039> the<00:00:53.219> same<00:00:53.489> pressure<00:00:54.329> release<00:00:54.809> mechanism

00:00:55.580 --> 00:00:55.590 
has the same pressure release mechanism

00:00:55.590 --> 00:00:57.350 
has the same pressure release mechanism
for<00:00:55.890> opening<00:00:56.370> the<00:00:56.460> front<00:00:56.610> of<00:00:56.760> the<00:00:56.820> capo<00:00:57.120> to<00:00:57.180> get

for opening the front of the capo to get
it<00:00:57.449> on<00:00:57.539> the<00:00:57.690> guitars<00:00:57.960> this<00:00:58.230> one<00:00:58.440> the

00:00:59.150 --> 00:00:59.160 
it on the guitars this one the

00:00:59.160 --> 00:01:01.310 
it on the guitars this one the
difference<00:00:59.579> is<00:00:59.789> this<00:01:00.059> is<00:01:00.120> their<00:01:00.480> new<00:01:00.660> click

00:01:01.310 --> 00:01:01.320 
difference is this is their new click
