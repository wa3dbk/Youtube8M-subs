00:00:05.819 --> 00:00:09.690
 You already know that I like to promote 

00:00:07.740 --> 00:00:12.360
 very rich games that only happen almost 

00:00:09.690 --> 00:00:15.360
 once in a lifetime and today I bring you one 

00:00:12.360 --> 00:00:18.390
 Fucked app in 3 against 3 on this map 

00:00:15.360 --> 00:00:20.189
 that your planet has its mountains of 

00:00:18.390 --> 00:00:22.270
 please access the artist's 

00:00:20.189 --> 00:00:25.730
 we are to present 

00:00:22.270 --> 00:00:29.140
 hello everyone I'm kevin and on my channel 

00:00:25.730 --> 00:00:32.180
 most of all his call of duty leford and 

00:00:29.140 --> 00:00:33.980
 random clips that sometimes I get because 

00:00:32.180 --> 00:00:35.809
 as I do not have capture hd then good 

00:00:33.980 --> 00:00:37.190
 took advantage of the cinema and walter mode is that 

00:00:35.809 --> 00:00:38.870
 it's a bit trash 

00:00:37.190 --> 00:00:40.910
 this is how you have seen what he said 

00:00:38.870 --> 00:00:42.879
 super fast and we have planned the 

00:00:40.910 --> 00:00:44.960
 comment to make it extremely 

00:00:42.879 --> 00:00:47.540
 very fast because as you can see in the 

00:00:44.960 --> 00:00:49.730
 duration of the video is very short it is pulled out 

00:00:47.540 --> 00:00:52.430
 fashionable with this franco that what is the 

00:00:49.730 --> 00:00:55.430
 barre does not go like that in the golden district 

00:00:52.430 --> 00:00:58.010
 the uap is removed in two and a half minutes 

00:00:55.430 --> 00:00:59.960
 barely so as you can see you already know there 

00:00:58.010 --> 00:01:02.989
 a triple by the face is made 

00:00:59.960 --> 00:01:05.869
 incredible and how do you see how you did to 

00:01:02.989 --> 00:01:08.600
 get this love for you first take some 

00:01:05.869 --> 00:01:10.460
 sideburns and fast because they have just 

00:01:08.600 --> 00:01:12.710
 take out the maps and I saw that the restaurant 

00:01:10.460 --> 00:01:13.820
 putisima shit and nothing because I was 

00:01:12.710 --> 00:01:15.560
 controlling more than anything those of me 

00:01:13.820 --> 00:01:17.479
 team to see where they got in and see 

00:01:15.560 --> 00:01:19.310
 where did they come from but I saw them later 

00:01:17.479 --> 00:01:21.020
 when he sees the result that you are not 

00:01:19.310 --> 00:01:22.940
 a team you are alone 

00:01:21.020 --> 00:01:26.090
 yes yes I was when it's just you 

00:01:22.940 --> 00:01:27.530
 you are alone and the opposing team has 

00:01:26.090 --> 00:01:29.960
 your prestige 

00:01:27.530 --> 00:01:31.880
 if they went to arms, it was not that they were 

00:01:29.960 --> 00:01:33.110
 Franks all dodge everything 

00:01:31.880 --> 00:01:34.430
 it means is that he wanted this 

00:01:33.110 --> 00:01:35.780
 is bathed if I could just a little 

00:01:34.430 --> 00:01:37.280
 shit because it is that then you go to see the 

00:01:35.780 --> 00:01:38.630
 result as you see I have removed the 

00:01:37.280 --> 00:01:40.580
 beginning of the game because it 

00:01:38.630 --> 00:01:43.369
 they killed all the time which he wants 

00:01:40.580 --> 00:01:45.020
 say that if you look for a 30-0 and look for a 

00:01:43.369 --> 00:01:46.940
 game of the search but it came out 

00:01:45.020 --> 00:01:48.710
 it means that these games then 

00:01:46.940 --> 00:01:50.570
 can happen because yes or no and 

00:01:48.710 --> 00:01:52.790
 kevin to be lucky that he has 

00:01:50.570 --> 00:01:54.770
 past so you already know here moment to 

00:01:52.790 --> 00:01:57.500
 pep and we wanted to believe that it serves 

00:01:54.770 --> 00:01:59.479
 win the game the celebration of 

00:01:57.500 --> 00:02:01.640
 celebration that can not miss and already 

00:01:59.479 --> 00:02:03.679
 you know if you have games like this 

00:02:01.640 --> 00:02:05.210
 or what do you think they deserve to be in a 

00:02:03.679 --> 00:02:07.580
 channel that has more subscribers than 

00:02:05.210 --> 00:02:09.259
 you tell me and I love the 

00:02:07.580 --> 00:02:11.810
 promoted because these games effective 

00:02:09.259 --> 00:02:13.069
 they deserve to be seen again and again like this 

00:02:11.810 --> 00:02:15.290
 a little baby and until next time 

00:02:13.069 --> 00:02:16.880
 until next time and now you are going to see the 

00:02:15.290 --> 00:02:22.209
 result for you to see that there is no 

00:02:16.880 --> 00:02:22.209
 nothing bad in itself no
