00:01:45.289 --> 00:01:45.299 
so as you can see side by side we have

00:01:45.299 --> 00:01:47.600 
so as you can see side by side we have
assassins<00:01:45.960> creed<00:01:46.140> unity<00:01:46.530> on<00:01:46.890> the<00:01:47.159> right<00:01:47.399> and

00:01:47.600 --> 00:01:47.610 
assassins creed unity on the right and

00:01:47.610 --> 00:01:49.880 
assassins creed unity on the right and
then<00:01:47.700> we<00:01:47.820> do<00:01:48.000> have<00:01:48.210> yet<00:01:48.450> to<00:01:48.659> 18th<00:01:49.170> century<00:01:49.680> map

00:01:49.880 --> 00:01:49.890 
then we do have yet to 18th century map

00:01:49.890 --> 00:01:53.120 
then we do have yet to 18th century map
on<00:01:50.070> the<00:01:50.399> left<00:01:50.810> so<00:01:51.810> in<00:01:52.049> terms<00:01:52.320> of<00:01:52.530> both<00:01:52.740> scale

00:01:53.120 --> 00:01:53.130 
on the left so in terms of both scale

00:01:53.130 --> 00:01:55.160 
on the left so in terms of both scale
and<00:01:53.399> design<00:01:53.759> they<00:01:54.030> both<00:01:54.299> do<00:01:54.570> look<00:01:54.750> very<00:01:54.780> very

00:01:55.160 --> 00:01:55.170 
and design they both do look very very

00:01:55.170 --> 00:01:57.469 
and design they both do look very very
similar<00:01:55.710> in<00:01:55.979> my<00:01:56.310> point<00:01:56.640> of<00:01:56.759> view<00:01:56.790> and<00:01:57.119> it<00:01:57.210> just

00:01:57.469 --> 00:01:57.479 
similar in my point of view and it just

00:01:57.479 --> 00:01:59.539 
similar in my point of view and it just
goes<00:01:57.689> to<00:01:57.840> show<00:01:57.899> how<00:01:58.259> far<00:01:58.590> you<00:01:58.890> soft<00:01:59.219> I've<00:01:59.369> gone

00:01:59.539 --> 00:01:59.549 
goes to show how far you soft I've gone

00:01:59.549 --> 00:02:01.969 
goes to show how far you soft I've gone
out<00:01:59.820> to<00:02:00.030> make<00:02:00.240> this<00:02:00.420> game<00:02:00.719> really<00:02:01.020> realistic

00:02:01.969 --> 00:02:01.979 
out to make this game really realistic

00:02:01.979 --> 00:02:04.819 
out to make this game really realistic
and<00:02:02.280> it<00:02:02.880> is<00:02:03.030> approximately<00:02:03.329> meant<00:02:04.079> to<00:02:04.200> be<00:02:04.320> 50

00:02:04.819 --> 00:02:04.829 
and it is approximately meant to be 50

00:02:04.829 --> 00:02:07.160 
and it is approximately meant to be 50

00:02:11.500 --> 00:02:11.510 
the Sassen screech team has ever

00:02:11.510 --> 00:02:13.570 
the Sassen screech team has ever
create<00:02:11.870> it<00:02:12.140> and<00:02:12.409> don't<00:02:13.040> forget<00:02:13.310> that<00:02:13.489> of

00:02:13.570 --> 00:02:13.580 
create it and don't forget that of

00:02:13.580 --> 00:02:15.460 
create it and don't forget that of
course<00:02:13.760> we<00:02:14.030> can<00:02:14.239> enter<00:02:14.599> a<00:02:14.629> quarter<00:02:15.140> off<00:02:15.290> the

00:02:15.460 --> 00:02:15.470 
course we can enter a quarter off the

00:02:15.470 --> 00:02:17.199 
course we can enter a quarter off the
building<00:02:15.890> so<00:02:16.069> that<00:02:16.250> is<00:02:16.370> probably<00:02:16.610> going<00:02:17.090> to

00:02:17.199 --> 00:02:17.209 
building so that is probably going to

00:02:17.209 --> 00:02:19.119 
building so that is probably going to
make<00:02:17.480> Vermette<00:02:17.870> feel<00:02:18.140> like<00:02:18.319> 100<00:02:18.799> times<00:02:19.010> more

00:02:19.119 --> 00:02:19.129 
make Vermette feel like 100 times more

00:02:19.129 --> 00:02:21.520 
make Vermette feel like 100 times more
bigger<00:02:19.549> and<00:02:19.939> I<00:02:20.209> do<00:02:20.269> believe<00:02:20.599> it<00:02:20.900> was<00:02:21.019> one<00:02:21.290> out

00:02:21.520 --> 00:02:21.530 
bigger and I do believe it was one out

00:02:21.530 --> 00:02:23.259 
bigger and I do believe it was one out
