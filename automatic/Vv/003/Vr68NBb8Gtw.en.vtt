00:00:10.110 --> 00:00:10.120 
now I've had a few people asking me

00:00:10.120 --> 00:00:10.950 
now I've had a few people asking me
about<00:00:10.269> how

00:00:10.950 --> 00:00:10.960 
about how

00:00:10.960 --> 00:00:13.230 
about how
setup<00:00:11.230> your<00:00:11.380> ax<00:00:11.650> in<00:00:12.040> fliter<00:00:12.640> and<00:00:12.820> this<00:00:12.910> is<00:00:13.030> mine

00:00:13.230 --> 00:00:13.240 
setup your ax in fliter and this is mine

00:00:13.240 --> 00:00:15.270 
setup your ax in fliter and this is mine
but<00:00:13.750> very<00:00:13.960> one<00:00:14.140> that<00:00:14.320> hit<00:00:14.470> the<00:00:14.650> control<00:00:15.010> tower

00:00:15.270 --> 00:00:15.280 
but very one that hit the control tower

00:00:15.280 --> 00:00:17.490 
but very one that hit the control tower
just<00:00:15.310> a<00:00:15.730> week<00:00:16.150> or<00:00:16.240> so<00:00:16.420> ago<00:00:16.450> and<00:00:16.930> as<00:00:17.260> you<00:00:17.320> can<00:00:17.440> see

00:00:17.490 --> 00:00:17.500 
just a week or so ago and as you can see

00:00:17.500 --> 00:00:19.100 
just a week or so ago and as you can see
it<00:00:17.680> still<00:00:17.890> looks<00:00:18.070> stunning<00:00:18.340> condition<00:00:18.820> having

00:00:19.100 --> 00:00:19.110 
it still looks stunning condition having

00:00:19.110 --> 00:00:21.000 
it still looks stunning condition having
encountered<00:00:20.110> such<00:00:20.260> a<00:00:20.290> large<00:00:20.619> and<00:00:20.860> heavy

00:00:21.000 --> 00:00:21.010 
encountered such a large and heavy

00:00:21.010 --> 00:00:22.830 
encountered such a large and heavy
object<00:00:21.400> and<00:00:22.180> I'm<00:00:22.300> gonna<00:00:22.420> show<00:00:22.570> you<00:00:22.630> what<00:00:22.779> I

00:00:22.830 --> 00:00:22.840 
object and I'm gonna show you what I

00:00:22.840 --> 00:00:24.690 
object and I'm gonna show you what I
what<00:00:23.200> I've<00:00:23.290> done<00:00:23.410> to<00:00:23.560> set<00:00:23.770> mine<00:00:23.920> up<00:00:23.950> inside<00:00:24.580> now

00:00:24.690 --> 00:00:24.700 
what I've done to set mine up inside now

00:00:24.700 --> 00:00:27.180 
what I've done to set mine up inside now
I<00:00:24.910> prefer<00:00:25.510> to<00:00:25.689> buy<00:00:25.840> the<00:00:25.900> 8<00:00:26.320> RF<00:00:26.770> vision<00:00:27.100> which

00:00:27.180 --> 00:00:27.190 
I prefer to buy the 8 RF vision which

00:00:27.190 --> 00:00:29.760 
I prefer to buy the 8 RF vision which
has<00:00:27.340> just<00:00:27.520> the<00:00:27.700> motor<00:00:27.940> and<00:00:28.330> the<00:00:29.050> airframe<00:00:29.590> no

00:00:29.760 --> 00:00:29.770 
has just the motor and the airframe no

00:00:29.770 --> 00:00:31.320 
has just the motor and the airframe no
speed<00:00:29.980> control<00:00:30.310> in<00:00:30.400> most<00:00:30.550> surveys<00:00:30.760> the<00:00:31.060> reason

00:00:31.320 --> 00:00:31.330 
speed control in most surveys the reason

00:00:31.330 --> 00:00:33.270 
speed control in most surveys the reason
for<00:00:31.450> that<00:00:31.510> is<00:00:31.869> because<00:00:32.050> you<00:00:32.830> can<00:00:32.950> put<00:00:33.070> better

00:00:33.270 --> 00:00:33.280 
for that is because you can put better

00:00:33.280 --> 00:00:34.740 
for that is because you can put better
surveys<00:00:33.670> in<00:00:33.820> than<00:00:33.970> the<00:00:34.059> standard<00:00:34.390> ones<00:00:34.540> for

00:00:34.740 --> 00:00:34.750 
surveys in than the standard ones for

00:00:34.750 --> 00:00:35.939 
surveys in than the standard ones for
realies<00:00:34.960> no<00:00:35.170> extra<00:00:35.470> cost

00:00:35.939 --> 00:00:35.949 
realies no extra cost

00:00:35.949 --> 00:00:37.650 
realies no extra cost
now<00:00:36.250> if<00:00:36.340> we<00:00:36.430> look<00:00:36.550> inside<00:00:36.699> here<00:00:37.000> you<00:00:37.120> can<00:00:37.239> see<00:00:37.420> I

00:00:37.650 --> 00:00:37.660 
now if we look inside here you can see I

00:00:37.660 --> 00:00:39.960 
now if we look inside here you can see I
have<00:00:38.050> the<00:00:38.320> free<00:00:38.890> sky<00:00:39.129> receiver<00:00:39.520> just<00:00:39.730> a<00:00:39.790> bit<00:00:39.910> of

00:00:39.960 --> 00:00:39.970 
have the free sky receiver just a bit of

00:00:39.970 --> 00:00:42.180 
have the free sky receiver just a bit of
velcro<00:00:40.120> here<00:00:40.480> against<00:00:40.930> that<00:00:41.140> firewall<00:00:41.800> makes

00:00:42.180 --> 00:00:42.190 
velcro here against that firewall makes

00:00:42.190 --> 00:00:44.310 
velcro here against that firewall makes
nice<00:00:42.370> and<00:00:42.550> easy<00:00:42.670> to<00:00:42.820> get<00:00:42.940> it<00:00:43.030> in<00:00:43.450> and<00:00:43.840> out<00:00:43.989> about

00:00:44.310 --> 00:00:44.320 
nice and easy to get it in and out about

00:00:44.320 --> 00:00:45.860 
nice and easy to get it in and out about
two<00:00:44.470> of<00:00:44.590> the<00:00:44.649> little<00:00:44.860> hobbyking<00:00:45.250> up<00:00:45.370> a<00:00:45.579> 10-gram

00:00:45.860 --> 00:00:45.870 
two of the little hobbyking up a 10-gram

00:00:45.870 --> 00:00:49.799 
two of the little hobbyking up a 10-gram
orange<00:00:46.870> servos<00:00:47.850> they<00:00:48.850> work<00:00:49.090> extremely<00:00:49.329> well

00:00:49.799 --> 00:00:49.809 
orange servos they work extremely well

00:00:49.809 --> 00:00:51.510 
orange servos they work extremely well
in<00:00:50.050> this<00:00:50.110> application<00:00:50.649> and<00:00:50.980> for<00:00:51.309> speed

00:00:51.510 --> 00:00:51.520 
in this application and for speed

00:00:51.520 --> 00:00:52.740 
in this application and for speed
control<00:00:51.670> and<00:00:52.030> this<00:00:52.090> is<00:00:52.149> the<00:00:52.329> reason<00:00:52.510> i<00:00:52.690> don't

00:00:52.740 --> 00:00:52.750 
control and this is the reason i don't

00:00:52.750 --> 00:00:55.470 
control and this is the reason i don't
really<00:00:53.200> like<00:00:53.320> the<00:00:54.190> ready<00:00:54.730> to<00:00:54.910> fly<00:00:55.120> version

00:00:55.470 --> 00:00:55.480 
really like the ready to fly version

00:00:55.480 --> 00:00:56.790 
really like the ready to fly version
with<00:00:55.600> the<00:00:55.630> built-in<00:00:55.960> speed<00:00:56.230> control<00:00:56.530> and<00:00:56.559> all

00:00:56.790 --> 00:00:56.800 
with the built-in speed control and all

00:00:56.800 --> 00:00:58.319 
with the built-in speed control and all
the<00:00:56.860> servos<00:00:57.190> installers<00:00:57.550> because<00:00:57.790> they<00:00:58.180> give

00:00:58.319 --> 00:00:58.329 
the servos installers because they give

00:00:58.329 --> 00:01:00.330 
the servos installers because they give
you<00:00:58.450> a<00:00:58.510> 20<00:00:58.840> amp<00:00:58.989> speed<00:00:59.320> control<00:00:59.620> that<00:00:59.770> only<00:00:59.950> has

00:01:00.330 --> 00:01:00.340 
you a 20 amp speed control that only has

00:01:00.340 --> 00:01:03.180 
you a 20 amp speed control that only has
a<00:01:00.550> 2<00:01:00.760> amp<00:01:00.910> baked<00:01:01.840> and<00:01:02.110> 1/10<00:01:02.469> my<00:01:02.680> secular<00:01:02.920> side

00:01:03.180 --> 00:01:03.190 
a 2 amp baked and 1/10 my secular side

00:01:03.190 --> 00:01:05.639 
a 2 amp baked and 1/10 my secular side
you<00:01:03.340> see<00:01:03.520> and<00:01:04.270> this<00:01:04.390> one<00:01:04.509> I<00:01:04.540> put<00:01:04.720> the<00:01:04.899> hobbyking

00:01:05.639 --> 00:01:05.649 
you see and this one I put the hobbyking

00:01:05.649 --> 00:01:09.029 
you see and this one I put the hobbyking
super<00:01:06.280> simple<00:01:06.550> 25-30<00:01:07.420> speed<00:01:08.290> controller<00:01:08.680> and

00:01:09.029 --> 00:01:09.039 
super simple 25-30 speed controller and

00:01:09.039 --> 00:01:11.340 
super simple 25-30 speed controller and
this<00:01:09.430> has<00:01:09.580> a<00:01:09.610> 3<00:01:09.970> amp<00:01:10.119> big<00:01:10.360> and<00:01:10.840> it<00:01:10.960> makes<00:01:11.110> all

00:01:11.340 --> 00:01:11.350 
this has a 3 amp big and it makes all

00:01:11.350 --> 00:01:13.410 
this has a 3 amp big and it makes all
the<00:01:11.560> difference<00:01:11.680> because<00:01:11.979> before<00:01:12.850> servos<00:01:13.240> to

00:01:13.410 --> 00:01:13.420 
the difference because before servos to

00:01:13.420 --> 00:01:15.030 
the difference because before servos to
ant<00:01:13.660> just<00:01:13.930> isn't<00:01:14.259> enough<00:01:14.619> to<00:01:14.830> give<00:01:14.950> you

00:01:15.030 --> 00:01:15.040 
ant just isn't enough to give you

00:01:15.040 --> 00:01:16.800 
ant just isn't enough to give you
reliable<00:01:15.280> servo<00:01:15.880> operation<00:01:16.479> if<00:01:16.600> I<00:01:16.690> look

00:01:16.800 --> 00:01:16.810 
reliable servo operation if I look

00:01:16.810 --> 00:01:18.390 
reliable servo operation if I look
underneath<00:01:17.049> on<00:01:17.440> the<00:01:17.740> wings<00:01:17.920> you'll<00:01:18.100> see<00:01:18.280> that

00:01:18.390 --> 00:01:18.400 
underneath on the wings you'll see that

00:01:18.400 --> 00:01:20.640 
underneath on the wings you'll see that
I've<00:01:18.490> got<00:01:19.270> the<00:01:19.360> orange<00:01:19.690> hobbyking<00:01:20.290> servos<00:01:20.619> and

00:01:20.640 --> 00:01:20.650 
I've got the orange hobbyking servos and

00:01:20.650 --> 00:01:22.440 
I've got the orange hobbyking servos and
the<00:01:20.830> wings<00:01:20.979> as<00:01:21.190> well<00:01:21.220> and<00:01:21.909> I<00:01:21.970> just<00:01:22.000> held<00:01:22.330> them

00:01:22.440 --> 00:01:22.450 
the wings as well and I just held them

00:01:22.450 --> 00:01:24.600 
the wings as well and I just held them
with<00:01:22.659> a<00:01:22.690> bit<00:01:22.840> of<00:01:22.869> double-sided<00:01:23.290> tape<00:01:23.740> works

00:01:24.600 --> 00:01:24.610 
with a bit of double-sided tape works

00:01:24.610 --> 00:01:27.690 
with a bit of double-sided tape works
extremely<00:01:24.909> well<00:01:25.860> so<00:01:26.860> that's<00:01:27.040> how<00:01:27.220> I've<00:01:27.369> set<00:01:27.670> it

00:01:27.690 --> 00:01:27.700 
extremely well so that's how I've set it

00:01:27.700 --> 00:01:29.310 
extremely well so that's how I've set it
up<00:01:27.850> in<00:01:27.970> the<00:01:28.030> speed<00:01:28.240> controller<00:01:28.570> some<00:01:29.110> people

00:01:29.310 --> 00:01:29.320 
up in the speed controller some people

00:01:29.320 --> 00:01:30.420 
up in the speed controller some people
like<00:01:29.439> to<00:01:29.470> shove<00:01:29.710> it<00:01:29.830> right<00:01:30.010> down<00:01:30.130> the<00:01:30.310> back

00:01:30.420 --> 00:01:30.430 
like to shove it right down the back

00:01:30.430 --> 00:01:33.330 
like to shove it right down the back
here<00:01:30.490> I've<00:01:30.820> kicked<00:01:31.360> it<00:01:31.510> up<00:01:31.600> the<00:01:31.720> front<00:01:32.340> it

00:01:33.330 --> 00:01:33.340 
here I've kicked it up the front it

00:01:33.340 --> 00:01:34.560 
here I've kicked it up the front it
looks<00:01:33.490> a<00:01:33.549> bit<00:01:33.580> Messier<00:01:34.000> but<00:01:34.030> it<00:01:34.210> does<00:01:34.360> mean

00:01:34.560 --> 00:01:34.570 
looks a bit Messier but it does mean

00:01:34.570 --> 00:01:37.050 
looks a bit Messier but it does mean
that<00:01:34.600> I<00:01:34.900> can<00:01:35.680> put<00:01:36.220> other<00:01:36.369> stuff<00:01:36.520> up<00:01:36.729> here<00:01:36.909> my

00:01:37.050 --> 00:01:37.060 
that I can put other stuff up here my

disconnected from these cells so to

00:02:23.799 --> 00:02:24.780 
disconnected from these cells so to
avoid<00:02:24.010> that<00:02:24.070> happening

to get at mine by putting my speaker on

00:03:02.230 --> 00:03:03.360 
to get at mine by putting my speaker on
the<00:03:02.349> top<00:03:02.470> I<00:03:02.560> can<00:03:02.680> just<00:03:02.799> push<00:03:02.950> it<00:03:02.980> forward<00:03:03.340> a

00:03:03.360 --> 00:03:03.370 
the top I can just push it forward a

00:03:03.370 --> 00:03:04.740 
the top I can just push it forward a
little<00:03:03.400> bit<00:03:03.579> push<00:03:03.819> the<00:03:03.940> wires<00:03:04.120> into<00:03:04.329> this<00:03:04.540> end

00:03:04.740 --> 00:03:04.750 
little bit push the wires into this end

00:03:04.750 --> 00:03:06.660 
little bit push the wires into this end
of<00:03:04.900> that<00:03:05.079> nose<00:03:05.709> doing<00:03:05.920> it<00:03:06.069> one-handed<00:03:06.370> makes

00:03:06.660 --> 00:03:06.670 
of that nose doing it one-handed makes

00:03:06.670 --> 00:03:08.160 
of that nose doing it one-handed makes
it<00:03:06.760> a<00:03:06.849> lot<00:03:07.060> harder<00:03:07.120> there<00:03:07.720> we<00:03:07.810> go

00:03:08.160 --> 00:03:08.170 
it a lot harder there we go

00:03:08.170 --> 00:03:11.119 
it a lot harder there we go
then<00:03:08.769> I<00:03:08.950> can<00:03:09.129> play<00:03:09.250> my<00:03:09.370> venture<00:03:09.639> into<00:03:09.760> here<00:03:10.000> and

00:03:11.119 --> 00:03:11.129 
then I can play my venture into here and

00:03:11.129 --> 00:03:12.720 
then I can play my venture into here and
everything<00:03:12.129> is<00:03:12.190> well<00:03:12.370> away<00:03:12.519> from<00:03:12.549> the

00:03:30.839 --> 00:03:30.849 
and again one-handed this is a bit of a

00:03:30.849 --> 00:03:34.830 
and again one-handed this is a bit of a
chore<00:03:32.760> anyway<00:03:33.760> doesn't<00:03:34.000> like<00:03:34.180> that<00:03:34.329> but<00:03:34.720> one

00:03:34.830 --> 00:03:34.840 
chore anyway doesn't like that but one

00:03:34.840 --> 00:03:36.569 
chore anyway doesn't like that but one
thing<00:03:34.870> you<00:03:35.079> should<00:03:35.290> do<00:03:35.470> what<00:03:36.040> we're<00:03:36.190> doing<00:03:36.459> is

00:03:36.569 --> 00:03:36.579 
thing you should do what we're doing is

00:03:36.579 --> 00:03:39.420 
thing you should do what we're doing is
if<00:03:37.540> I<00:03:37.599> can<00:03:37.780> find<00:03:37.989> it<00:03:38.230> which<00:03:38.919> I<00:03:39.069> can't<00:03:39.280> it's

00:03:39.420 --> 00:03:39.430 
if I can find it which I can't it's

00:03:39.430 --> 00:03:41.699 
if I can find it which I can't it's
using<00:03:39.639> a<00:03:39.699> big<00:03:39.879> rubber<00:03:40.030> band<00:03:40.329> on<00:03:40.959> the<00:03:41.019> canopy

00:03:41.699 --> 00:03:41.709 
using a big rubber band on the canopy

00:03:41.709 --> 00:03:43.439 
using a big rubber band on the canopy
just<00:03:42.010> to<00:03:42.280> make<00:03:42.400> doubly<00:03:42.760> sure<00:03:42.910> things<00:03:43.329> that

00:03:43.439 --> 00:03:43.449 
just to make doubly sure things that

00:03:43.449 --> 00:03:44.400 
just to make doubly sure things that
gonna<00:03:43.599> fall<00:03:43.750> out<00:03:43.780> especially<00:03:44.199> if<00:03:44.290> you're

00:03:44.400 --> 00:03:44.410 
gonna fall out especially if you're

00:03:44.410 --> 00:03:46.259 
gonna fall out especially if you're
hooning<00:03:44.650> around<00:03:44.709> doing<00:03:45.099> inverted<00:03:45.549> and<00:03:45.639> rolls

and<00:03:46.449> all<00:03:46.540> sorts<00:03:46.750> of<00:03:46.780> things<00:03:46.900> because<00:03:47.230> that

00:03:47.729 --> 00:03:47.739 
and all sorts of things because that

00:03:47.739 --> 00:03:48.960 
and all sorts of things because that
battery<00:03:48.040> comes<00:03:48.220> loose<00:03:48.400> it<00:03:48.579> could<00:03:48.699> push<00:03:48.849> the

00:03:48.960 --> 00:03:48.970 
battery comes loose it could push the

00:03:48.970 --> 00:03:50.610 
battery comes loose it could push the
canopy<00:03:49.269> off<00:03:49.389> one<00:03:49.810> time<00:03:49.989> you<00:03:50.139> will<00:03:50.260> make<00:03:50.319> it<00:03:50.530> a

00:03:50.610 --> 00:03:50.620 
canopy off one time you will make it a

00:03:50.620 --> 00:03:52.020 
canopy off one time you will make it a
bit<00:03:50.799> not<00:03:51.010> enough<00:03:51.190> to<00:03:51.310> hold<00:03:51.400> it<00:03:51.549> really<00:03:51.639> sir<00:03:51.819> a

00:03:52.020 --> 00:03:52.030 
bit not enough to hold it really sir a

00:03:52.030 --> 00:03:53.580 
bit not enough to hold it really sir a
rubber<00:03:52.299> band<00:03:52.510> around<00:03:52.690> here<00:03:52.930> so<00:03:53.440> that's

00:03:53.580 --> 00:03:53.590 
rubber band around here so that's

00:03:53.590 --> 00:03:55.409 
rubber band around here so that's
basically<00:03:53.980> my<00:03:54.069> eggs<00:03:54.370> input<00:03:54.699> it's<00:03:54.849> all<00:03:55.030> stock

to stop it from coming off seems to be

00:04:07.930 --> 00:04:10.020 
to stop it from coming off seems to be
working<00:04:08.260> perfectly<00:04:08.500> fine<00:04:09.340> and<00:04:09.699> as<00:04:09.819> you<00:04:09.909> can

00:04:12.569 --> 00:04:12.579 
see it's been a bit of fpv gear going on

00:04:12.579 --> 00:04:14.099 
see it's been a bit of fpv gear going on
here<00:04:12.819> and<00:04:13.060> it's<00:04:13.359> coming<00:04:13.569> real<00:04:13.780> soon<00:04:13.810> on<00:04:14.049> the
