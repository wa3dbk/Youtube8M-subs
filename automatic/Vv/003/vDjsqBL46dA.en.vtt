seems to be that recently heard stories

00:00:13.590 --> 00:00:15.799 
seems to be that recently heard stories
of<00:00:13.639> quite<00:00:14.639> a<00:00:14.670> secretive<00:00:15.089> group<00:00:15.150> of<00:00:15.570> players

00:00:15.799 --> 00:00:15.809 
of quite a secretive group of players

00:00:15.809 --> 00:00:18.529 
of quite a secretive group of players
known<00:00:16.170> as<00:00:16.289> llamas<00:00:16.560> and<00:00:17.390> which<00:00:18.390> were

00:00:18.529 --> 00:00:18.539 
known as llamas and which were

00:00:18.539 --> 00:00:19.970 
known as llamas and which were
completely<00:00:18.900> new<00:00:19.140> to<00:00:19.320> me<00:00:19.439> I've<00:00:19.619> never<00:00:19.740> heard

00:00:19.970 --> 00:00:19.980 
completely new to me I've never heard

00:00:19.980 --> 00:00:23.060

them<00:00:20.130> before<00:00:20.220> and<00:00:21.800> which<00:00:22.800> is<00:00:22.949> quite

00:00:23.060 --> 00:00:23.070 
them before and which is quite

00:00:23.070 --> 00:00:25.040 
them before and which is quite
surprising<00:00:23.279> because<00:00:23.850> I've<00:00:24.390> been<00:00:24.570> playing<00:00:24.779> for

00:00:25.040 --> 00:00:25.050 
surprising because I've been playing for

00:00:25.050 --> 00:00:27.980 
surprising because I've been playing for
about<00:00:25.260> ten<00:00:25.859> years<00:00:25.890> and<00:00:26.300> I've<00:00:27.300> never<00:00:27.480> come

00:00:27.980 --> 00:00:27.990 
about ten years and I've never come

00:00:27.990 --> 00:00:30.769 
about ten years and I've never come
across<00:00:28.050> these<00:00:28.529> people<00:00:28.890> before<00:00:29.240> so<00:00:30.240> I've

00:00:30.769 --> 00:00:30.779 
across these people before so I've

00:00:30.779 --> 00:00:32.540 
across these people before so I've
managed<00:00:31.050> to<00:00:31.080> track<00:00:31.380> down<00:00:31.439> one<00:00:32.099> of<00:00:32.219> the<00:00:32.340> kind<00:00:32.520> of

00:01:16.670 --> 00:01:16.680 
people really from different ways of

00:01:16.680 --> 00:01:18.289 
people really from different ways of
playing<00:01:16.770> the<00:01:17.040> game<00:01:17.220> and<00:01:17.520> different<00:01:18.000> walks<00:01:18.090> of

00:01:18.289 --> 00:01:18.299 
playing the game and different walks of

00:01:18.299 --> 00:01:20.090 
playing the game and different walks of
life<00:01:18.360> but<00:01:18.869> I<00:01:19.200> think<00:01:19.350> the<00:01:19.710> thing<00:01:19.860> that<00:01:19.979> we're

00:01:20.090 --> 00:01:20.100 
life but I think the thing that we're

00:01:20.100 --> 00:01:23.480 
life but I think the thing that we're
perhaps<00:01:21.290> most<00:01:22.290> visited<00:01:22.799> for<00:01:23.040> is<00:01:23.159> the<00:01:23.280> fact

00:01:23.480 --> 00:01:23.490 
perhaps most visited for is the fact

00:01:23.490 --> 00:01:24.890 
perhaps most visited for is the fact
that<00:01:23.580> we've<00:01:23.790> got<00:01:23.970> one<00:01:24.150> or<00:01:24.270> two<00:01:24.299> people<00:01:24.689> at<00:01:24.869> the

00:01:24.890 --> 00:01:24.900 
that we've got one or two people at the

00:01:24.900 --> 00:01:27.310 
that we've got one or two people at the
site<00:01:25.140> who<00:01:25.350> like<00:01:25.500> to<00:01:25.530> write<00:01:25.799> about<00:01:25.920> tactics<00:01:26.549> and

00:01:27.310 --> 00:01:27.320 
site who like to write about tactics and

00:01:27.320 --> 00:01:30.319 
site who like to write about tactics and
over<00:01:28.320> the<00:01:28.409> past<00:01:28.590> few<00:01:28.829> years<00:01:29.180> some<00:01:30.180> of<00:01:30.270> those

00:01:30.319 --> 00:01:30.329 
over the past few years some of those

00:01:30.329 --> 00:01:31.700 
over the past few years some of those
ideas<00:01:30.540> have<00:01:30.900> been<00:01:31.020> implemented<00:01:31.470> into<00:01:31.680> the

00:01:31.700 --> 00:01:31.710 
ideas have been implemented into the

00:01:31.710 --> 00:01:35.450 
ideas have been implemented into the
game<00:01:31.799> so<00:01:33.320> FM<00:01:34.320> britain<00:01:34.619> really<00:01:34.890> it's<00:01:35.040> kind<00:01:35.250> of<00:01:35.310> a

00:01:35.450 --> 00:01:35.460 
game so FM britain really it's kind of a

00:01:35.460 --> 00:01:39.130 
game so FM britain really it's kind of a
mix<00:01:35.909> between<00:01:36.000> a<00:01:36.329> kind<00:01:36.570> of<00:01:36.750> a<00:01:37.369> community

00:01:39.130 --> 00:01:39.140 
mix between a kind of a community

00:01:39.140 --> 00:01:41.510 
mix between a kind of a community
think-tank<00:01:40.140> where<00:01:40.350> people<00:01:40.650> put<00:01:41.220> all<00:01:41.340> their

00:01:41.510 --> 00:01:41.520 
think-tank where people put all their

ideas about the game into one place and

00:01:42.899 --> 00:01:44.359 
ideas about the game into one place and
then<00:01:43.140> we<00:01:43.229> discuss<00:01:43.560> them<00:01:43.770> and<00:01:43.950> talk<00:01:44.070> about<00:01:44.100> them

00:01:44.359 --> 00:01:44.369 
then we discuss them and talk about them

00:01:44.369 --> 00:01:46.670 
then we discuss them and talk about them
and<00:01:44.610> then<00:01:44.700> some<00:01:44.909> of<00:01:45.030> those<00:01:45.119> ideas<00:01:45.360> then<00:01:45.750> you

00:01:46.670 --> 00:01:46.680 
and then some of those ideas then you

00:01:46.680 --> 00:01:48.020 
and then some of those ideas then you
know<00:01:46.740> we<00:01:46.860> send<00:01:47.070> them<00:01:47.220> off<00:01:47.340> to<00:01:47.520> the<00:01:47.610> makers<00:01:47.909> of

the<00:02:11.430> game<00:02:11.550> you<00:02:11.610> just<00:02:11.760> got<00:02:12.090> your<00:02:12.209> own<00:02:12.360> save<00:02:12.720> and

00:02:13.010 --> 00:02:13.020 
the game you just got your own save and

00:02:13.020 --> 00:02:13.670 
the game you just got your own save and
you<00:02:13.080> have<00:02:13.200> to<00:02:13.319> play<00:02:13.470> it

00:02:13.670 --> 00:02:13.680 
you have to play it

00:02:13.680 --> 00:02:15.440 
you have to play it
realistically<00:02:14.159> as<00:02:14.340> possible<00:02:14.370> so<00:02:15.180> we've<00:02:15.299> got<00:02:15.420> a

00:02:15.440 --> 00:02:15.450 
realistically as possible so we've got a

00:02:15.450 --> 00:02:18.890 
realistically as possible so we've got a
decent<00:02:16.109> and<00:02:16.650> weird<00:02:17.040> mix<00:02:17.340> of<00:02:17.549> people<00:02:17.939> but<00:02:18.480> it's

00:02:18.890 --> 00:02:18.900 
decent and weird mix of people but it's

00:02:18.900 --> 00:02:21.050 
decent and weird mix of people but it's
just<00:02:18.989> an<00:02:19.170> online<00:02:19.439> community<00:02:19.859> really<00:02:20.250> from<00:02:20.519> the

00:02:21.050 --> 00:02:21.060 
just an online community really from the

00:02:21.060 --> 00:02:22.910 
just an online community really from the
days<00:02:21.209> before<00:02:21.420> Facebook<00:02:22.079> and<00:02:22.260> it<00:02:22.349> seems<00:02:22.769> to<00:02:22.829> a

00:02:22.910 --> 00:02:22.920 
days before Facebook and it seems to a

00:02:22.920 --> 00:02:28.520 
days before Facebook and it seems to a
survive<00:02:23.989> alarma<00:02:24.989> is<00:02:25.200> a<00:02:26.780> type<00:02:27.780> of<00:02:27.810> sheep

00:02:28.520 --> 00:02:28.530 
survive alarma is a type of sheep

00:02:28.530 --> 00:02:31.039 
survive alarma is a type of sheep
I<00:02:28.560> think<00:02:28.950> but<00:02:29.819> they've<00:02:30.060> called<00:02:30.840> themselves

00:02:31.039 --> 00:02:31.049 
I think but they've called themselves

00:02:31.049 --> 00:02:33.619 
I think but they've called themselves
llamas<00:02:31.799> these<00:02:32.010> players<00:02:32.480> because<00:02:33.480> they've

00:02:33.619 --> 00:02:33.629 
llamas these players because they've

00:02:33.629 --> 00:02:36.319 
llamas these players because they've
taken<00:02:33.780> the<00:02:34.079> llm<00:02:34.950> bit<00:02:35.519> which<00:02:35.700> is<00:02:35.730> lower<00:02:36.060> league

00:02:36.319 --> 00:02:36.329 
taken the llm bit which is lower league

00:02:36.329 --> 00:02:39.589 
taken the llm bit which is lower league
manager<00:02:36.959> and<00:02:37.760> they<00:02:38.760> get<00:02:38.969> quite<00:02:39.329> a<00:02:39.359> bad

00:02:39.589 --> 00:02:39.599 
manager and they get quite a bad

00:02:39.599 --> 00:02:40.910 
manager and they get quite a bad
reputation<00:02:39.900> which<00:02:40.319> they<00:02:40.469> don't<00:02:40.590> really

00:02:40.910 --> 00:02:40.920 
reputation which they don't really

00:02:40.920 --> 00:02:42.709 
reputation which they don't really
deserve<00:02:41.099> because<00:02:41.639> people<00:02:42.150> tend<00:02:42.359> to<00:02:42.389> try<00:02:42.599> and

00:02:42.709 --> 00:02:42.719 
deserve because people tend to try and

00:02:42.719 --> 00:02:44.000 
deserve because people tend to try and
wine<00:02:42.870> them<00:02:43.049> up<00:02:43.139> just<00:02:43.260> because<00:02:43.409> it's<00:02:43.620> easy<00:02:43.799> to

00:02:44.000 --> 00:02:44.010 
wine them up just because it's easy to

00:02:44.010 --> 00:02:45.740 
wine them up just because it's easy to
do<00:02:44.099> and<00:02:44.219> that's<00:02:44.370> always<00:02:44.549> fun

00:02:45.740 --> 00:02:45.750 
do and that's always fun

00:02:45.750 --> 00:02:47.479 
do and that's always fun
essentially<00:02:46.680> what<00:02:46.799> they<00:02:46.919> do<00:02:46.980> is<00:02:47.189> they<00:02:47.280> take<00:02:47.430> a

00:02:47.479 --> 00:02:47.489 
essentially what they do is they take a

00:02:47.489 --> 00:02:51.170 
essentially what they do is they take a
team<00:02:47.819> in<00:02:48.090> the<00:02:48.450> lowest<00:02:49.169> playable<00:02:50.040> division<00:02:51.000> of

00:02:51.170 --> 00:02:51.180 
team in the lowest playable division of

00:02:51.180 --> 00:02:52.720 
team in the lowest playable division of
any<00:02:51.510> league<00:02:51.750> in<00:02:51.870> the<00:02:51.959> world<00:02:52.139> so<00:02:52.319> it<00:02:52.409> would<00:02:52.500> be

00:02:52.720 --> 00:02:52.730 
any league in the world so it would be

00:02:52.730 --> 00:02:56.949 
any league in the world so it would be
conference<00:02:53.730> north<00:02:53.970> conference<00:02:54.329> south<00:02:55.700> surrey

c2<00:02:57.959> i<00:02:57.989> think<00:02:58.409> in<00:02:58.620> in<00:02:58.859> italy

00:02:59.959 --> 00:02:59.969 
c2 i think in in italy

00:02:59.969 --> 00:03:03.379 
c2 i think in in italy
this<00:03:00.389> is<00:03:00.480> segunda<00:03:00.959> they<00:03:01.680> in<00:03:01.980> in<00:03:02.760> spain<00:03:03.120> you

this is segunda they in in spain you

00:03:03.389 --> 00:03:06.860 
this is segunda they in in spain you
kind<00:03:03.780> of<00:03:03.810> get<00:03:03.959> the<00:03:04.049> idea<00:03:04.349> and<00:03:05.389> their<00:03:06.389> goal<00:03:06.659> then

00:03:06.860 --> 00:03:06.870 
kind of get the idea and their goal then

00:03:06.870 --> 00:03:07.789 
kind of get the idea and their goal then
will<00:03:07.019> be<00:03:07.109> to<00:03:07.260> play<00:03:07.409> the<00:03:07.530> game<00:03:07.680> as

00:03:07.789 --> 00:03:07.799 
will be to play the game as

00:03:07.799 --> 00:03:09.470 
will be to play the game as
realistically<00:03:08.370> as<00:03:08.489> possible<00:03:08.579> moving<00:03:09.329> their

00:03:09.470 --> 00:03:09.480 
realistically as possible moving their

00:03:09.480 --> 00:03:13.099 
realistically as possible moving their
way<00:03:09.510> up<00:03:09.840> through<00:03:10.109> the<00:03:10.290> leaks<00:03:10.500> so<00:03:11.450> they<00:03:12.450> will<00:03:12.900> do

00:03:13.099 --> 00:03:13.109 
way up through the leaks so they will do

00:03:13.109 --> 00:03:14.899 
way up through the leaks so they will do
things<00:03:13.319> like<00:03:13.560> sometimes<00:03:14.370> in<00:03:14.519> the<00:03:14.579> game<00:03:14.730> if

00:03:14.899 --> 00:03:14.909 
things like sometimes in the game if

00:03:14.909 --> 00:03:16.429 
things like sometimes in the game if
you're<00:03:15.060> English<00:03:15.329> and<00:03:15.719> you've<00:03:15.810> had<00:03:15.930> any<00:03:16.169> kind

00:03:16.429 --> 00:03:16.439 
you're English and you've had any kind

00:03:16.439 --> 00:03:17.719 
you're English and you've had any kind
of<00:03:16.530> success<00:03:16.799> whatsoever<00:03:17.099> even<00:03:17.459> in<00:03:17.549> Ligue<00:03:17.699> 1

00:03:17.719 --> 00:03:17.729 
of success whatsoever even in Ligue 1

00:03:17.729 --> 00:03:19.939 
of success whatsoever even in Ligue 1
you'll<00:03:18.150> get<00:03:18.269> off<00:03:18.389> of<00:03:18.419> the<00:03:18.599> England<00:03:18.870> job<00:03:19.139> they

00:03:19.939 --> 00:03:19.949 
you'll get off of the England job they

00:03:19.949 --> 00:03:21.530 
you'll get off of the England job they
would<00:03:20.069> see<00:03:20.220> it<00:03:20.340> as<00:03:20.430> unrealistic<00:03:20.849> to<00:03:21.120> then<00:03:21.269> take

00:03:21.530 --> 00:03:21.540 
would see it as unrealistic to then take

00:03:21.540 --> 00:03:23.170 
would see it as unrealistic to then take
the<00:03:21.750> England<00:03:22.079> job<00:03:22.229> so<00:03:22.379> they<00:03:22.470> wouldn't<00:03:22.680> do<00:03:22.919> it

00:03:23.170 --> 00:03:23.180 
the England job so they wouldn't do it

00:03:23.180 --> 00:03:25.339 
the England job so they wouldn't do it
similarly<00:03:24.180> they<00:03:24.269> would<00:03:24.389> find<00:03:24.569> it<00:03:24.690> unrealistic

00:03:25.339 --> 00:03:25.349 
similarly they would find it unrealistic

00:03:25.349 --> 00:03:28.430 
similarly they would find it unrealistic
for<00:03:26.040> you<00:03:26.190> to<00:03:26.370> be<00:03:26.639> able<00:03:26.760> to<00:03:26.970> scout<00:03:27.599> players<00:03:27.959> in

00:03:28.430 --> 00:03:28.440 
for you to be able to scout players in

00:03:28.440 --> 00:03:31.819 
for you to be able to scout players in
Armenia<00:03:29.430> if<00:03:29.819> you<00:03:30.389> were<00:03:30.750> a<00:03:30.780> very<00:03:31.199> small<00:03:31.290> club<00:03:31.739> in

00:03:31.819 --> 00:03:31.829 
Armenia if you were a very small club in

00:03:31.829 --> 00:03:34.129 
Armenia if you were a very small club in
Wales<00:03:32.069> so<00:03:32.400> they<00:03:32.699> refuse<00:03:33.389> to<00:03:33.419> do<00:03:33.659> that<00:03:33.840> kind<00:03:34.049> of

00:03:34.129 --> 00:03:34.139 
Wales so they refuse to do that kind of

00:03:34.139 --> 00:03:37.580 
Wales so they refuse to do that kind of
thing<00:03:35.299> so<00:03:36.299> really<00:03:36.540> they<00:03:36.659> they<00:03:36.689> use<00:03:37.260> the<00:03:37.379> tools

00:03:37.580 --> 00:03:37.590 
thing so really they they use the tools

00:03:37.590 --> 00:03:38.899 
thing so really they they use the tools
and<00:03:37.739> we're<00:03:37.829> going<00:03:37.979> to<00:03:38.040> play<00:03:38.250> what<00:03:38.549> they<00:03:38.729> would

00:03:38.899 --> 00:03:38.909 
and we're going to play what they would

00:03:38.909 --> 00:03:41.899 
and we're going to play what they would
term<00:03:39.120> realistically<00:03:39.870> so<00:03:40.400> you<00:03:41.400> have<00:03:41.579> to<00:03:41.729> use

00:03:41.899 --> 00:03:41.909 
term realistically so you have to use

00:03:41.909 --> 00:03:43.309 
term realistically so you have to use
the<00:03:42.090> scouts<00:03:42.389> in<00:03:42.599> the<00:03:42.689> game<00:03:42.810> you<00:03:42.930> can't<00:03:43.109> just

00:03:43.309 --> 00:03:43.319 
the scouts in the game you can't just

00:03:43.319 --> 00:03:44.749 
the scouts in the game you can't just
use<00:03:43.530> the<00:03:43.650> player<00:03:43.829> search<00:03:44.069> and<00:03:44.250> find<00:03:44.459> a<00:03:44.579> player

00:03:44.749 --> 00:03:44.759 
use the player search and find a player

00:03:44.759 --> 00:03:46.520 
use the player search and find a player
and<00:03:45.000> then<00:03:45.090> sign<00:03:45.329> them<00:03:45.509> you<00:03:45.599> have<00:03:45.750> to<00:03:45.959> you<00:03:46.500> have

00:03:52.650 --> 00:03:54.589 
items in the game and then you have to
scout<00:03:52.919> them<00:03:53.129> properly<00:03:53.489> to<00:03:53.729> know<00:03:54.239> how<00:03:54.389> good

00:05:42.600 --> 00:05:44.450 
the game before it had been released to
then<00:05:42.780> write<00:05:43.080> up<00:05:43.260> his<00:05:43.380> ideas<00:05:43.830> and<00:05:44.010> his<00:05:44.160> thoughts

00:05:44.450 --> 00:05:44.460 
then write up his ideas and his thoughts

00:05:44.460 --> 00:05:47.840 
then write up his ideas and his thoughts
on<00:05:44.700> the<00:05:45.150> game<00:05:45.330> and<00:05:46.290> it<00:05:46.410> started<00:05:46.770> off<00:05:46.890> as<00:05:47.130> a<00:05:47.370> this

00:05:47.840 --> 00:05:47.850 
on the game and it started off as a this

00:05:47.850 --> 00:05:49.940 
on the game and it started off as a this
game<00:05:48.060> doesn't<00:05:48.480> work<00:05:48.510> you<00:05:48.990> can't<00:05:49.230> make<00:05:49.380> a<00:05:49.410> 4-4-2

00:05:49.940 --> 00:05:49.950 
game doesn't work you can't make a 4-4-2

00:05:49.950 --> 00:05:52.040 
game doesn't work you can't make a 4-4-2
that<00:05:50.280> works<00:05:50.490> it's<00:05:50.760> rubbish<00:05:51.240> and<00:05:51.480> he<00:05:51.840> went<00:05:51.990> with

00:05:52.040 --> 00:05:52.050 
that works it's rubbish and he went with

00:05:52.050 --> 00:05:53.720 
that works it's rubbish and he went with
that<00:05:52.290> premise<00:05:52.620> and<00:05:52.980> he<00:05:53.040> just<00:05:53.310> finished<00:05:53.580> his

00:05:53.720 --> 00:05:53.730 
that premise and he just finished his

00:05:53.730 --> 00:05:55.820 
that premise and he just finished his
master's<00:05:53.880> degree<00:05:54.240> and<00:05:54.660> again<00:05:55.350> had<00:05:55.530> too<00:05:55.680> much

00:05:55.820 --> 00:05:55.830 
master's degree and again had too much

00:05:55.830 --> 00:05:58.160 
master's degree and again had too much
spare<00:05:56.010> time<00:05:56.040> on<00:05:56.400> his<00:05:56.490> hands<00:05:56.690> and<00:05:57.690> was<00:05:57.840> probably

00:05:58.160 --> 00:05:58.170 
spare time on his hands and was probably

00:05:58.170 --> 00:05:59.690 
spare time on his hands and was probably
just<00:05:58.350> a<00:05:58.380> little<00:05:58.500> bit<00:05:58.680> irritated<00:05:58.920> that<00:05:59.190> you

00:05:59.690 --> 00:05:59.700 
just a little bit irritated that you

00:05:59.700 --> 00:06:01.700 
just a little bit irritated that you
know<00:05:59.760> you<00:06:00.150> haven't<00:06:00.300> got<00:06:00.390> a<00:06:00.480> job<00:06:00.540> yet<00:06:00.750> so<00:06:01.470> he

00:06:01.700 --> 00:06:01.710 
know you haven't got a job yet so he

00:06:01.710 --> 00:06:03.410 
know you haven't got a job yet so he
started<00:06:02.370> to<00:06:02.430> write<00:06:02.610> basically<00:06:02.910> this<00:06:03.120> thesis

00:06:03.410 --> 00:06:03.420 
started to write basically this thesis

00:06:03.420 --> 00:06:05.330 
started to write basically this thesis
on<00:06:03.810> why<00:06:04.020> it<00:06:04.080> wasn't<00:06:04.350> working<00:06:04.530> and<00:06:04.980> he<00:06:05.100> found

00:06:05.330 --> 00:06:05.340 
on why it wasn't working and he found

00:06:05.340 --> 00:06:07.040 
on why it wasn't working and he found
out<00:06:05.550> through<00:06:05.760> doing<00:06:06.000> it<00:06:06.120> actually<00:06:06.180> if<00:06:06.900> you

00:06:07.040 --> 00:06:07.050 
out through doing it actually if you

00:06:07.050 --> 00:06:08.570 
out through doing it actually if you
think<00:06:07.080> about<00:06:07.260> it<00:06:07.440> logically<00:06:07.800> and<00:06:08.010> use<00:06:08.340> these

00:06:08.570 --> 00:06:08.580 
think about it logically and use these

00:06:08.580 --> 00:06:11.840 
think about it logically and use these
steps<00:06:08.910> this<00:06:09.600> works<00:06:09.930> so<00:06:10.290> over<00:06:11.160> the<00:06:11.310> over<00:06:11.820> the

00:06:11.840 --> 00:06:11.850 
steps this works so over the over the

00:06:11.850 --> 00:06:14.630 
steps this works so over the over the
last<00:06:12.060> five<00:06:12.750> years<00:06:12.780> he's<00:06:13.400> gradually<00:06:14.400> got<00:06:14.610> more

00:06:14.630 --> 00:06:14.640 
last five years he's gradually got more

00:06:14.640 --> 00:06:17.150 
last five years he's gradually got more
people<00:06:15.030> who<00:06:15.360> kind<00:06:16.110> of<00:06:16.200> have<00:06:16.440> read<00:06:16.860> what<00:06:17.040> he's

00:06:17.150 --> 00:06:17.160 
people who kind of have read what he's

00:06:17.160 --> 00:06:19.460 
people who kind of have read what he's
got<00:06:17.610> to<00:06:17.640> say<00:06:17.940> and<00:06:18.150> agree<00:06:18.450> with<00:06:18.480> his<00:06:19.230> methods

00:06:19.460 --> 00:06:19.470 
got to say and agree with his methods

00:06:19.470 --> 00:06:21.170 
got to say and agree with his methods
and<00:06:19.800> then<00:06:20.100> used<00:06:20.370> his<00:06:20.520> methods<00:06:20.910> to<00:06:20.970> try<00:06:21.090> and

00:06:21.170 --> 00:06:21.180 
and then used his methods to try and

00:06:21.180 --> 00:06:22.970 
and then used his methods to try and
find<00:06:21.300> out<00:06:21.420> more<00:06:21.540> about<00:06:21.660> the<00:06:21.840> game<00:06:22.020> and<00:06:22.230> it's

00:06:22.970 --> 00:06:22.980 
find out more about the game and it's

00:06:22.980 --> 00:06:24.860 
find out more about the game and it's
just<00:06:23.190> grown<00:06:23.580> really<00:06:24.000> over<00:06:24.270> the<00:06:24.390> past<00:06:24.540> years

00:06:24.860 --> 00:06:24.870 
just grown really over the past years

00:06:24.870 --> 00:06:26.360 
just grown really over the past years
and<00:06:25.020> there's<00:06:25.140> now<00:06:25.260> probably<00:06:26.250> there's

00:06:26.360 --> 00:06:26.370 
and there's now probably there's

00:06:26.370 --> 00:06:27.890 
and there's now probably there's
probably<00:06:26.580> bout<00:06:26.700> a<00:06:26.730> dozen<00:06:27.060> people<00:06:27.390> who<00:06:27.510> work<00:06:27.690> on

00:06:27.890 --> 00:06:27.900 
probably bout a dozen people who work on

00:06:27.900 --> 00:06:29.510 
probably bout a dozen people who work on
on<00:06:28.140> each<00:06:28.380> version<00:06:28.740> of<00:06:28.830> the<00:06:28.920> game<00:06:29.070> now

00:06:29.510 --> 00:06:29.520 
on each version of the game now

00:06:29.520 --> 00:06:31.880 
on each version of the game now
I<00:06:29.750> think<00:06:30.750> it's<00:06:30.870> testament<00:06:31.380> to<00:06:31.470> the<00:06:31.560> game<00:06:31.740> that

00:06:31.880 --> 00:06:31.890 
I think it's testament to the game that

00:06:31.890 --> 00:06:33.560 
I think it's testament to the game that
it<00:06:31.980> can<00:06:32.130> build<00:06:32.250> up<00:06:32.400> its<00:06:32.610> own<00:06:32.730> folklore<00:06:33.060> through

00:06:33.560 --> 00:06:33.570 
it can build up its own folklore through

00:06:33.570 --> 00:06:36.980 
it can build up its own folklore through
it<00:06:33.690> there<00:06:34.560> are<00:06:34.680> so<00:06:34.890> many<00:06:35.480> computer<00:06:36.480> games<00:06:36.720> that

00:06:36.980 --> 00:06:36.990 
it there are so many computer games that

00:06:36.990 --> 00:06:39.140 
it there are so many computer games that
are<00:06:37.200> that<00:06:38.100> are<00:06:38.220> released<00:06:38.490> annually<00:06:39.000> or

00:06:39.140 --> 00:06:39.150 
are that are released annually or

00:06:39.150 --> 00:06:41.270 
are that are released annually or
released<00:06:39.450> in<00:06:39.600> a<00:06:39.660> long<00:06:39.840> series<00:06:40.170> and

00:06:41.270 --> 00:06:41.280 
released in a long series and

00:06:41.280 --> 00:06:43.860 
released in a long series and
they<00:06:42.280> don't<00:06:42.490> really<00:06:42.610> build<00:06:42.910> up<00:06:43.090> the<00:06:43.600> kind<00:06:43.810> of

00:06:43.860 --> 00:06:43.870 
they don't really build up the kind of

00:06:43.870 --> 00:06:45.300 
they don't really build up the kind of
the<00:06:43.990> sense<00:06:44.169> of<00:06:44.289> community<00:06:44.350> I<00:06:44.710> never<00:06:45.009> get<00:06:45.220> the

00:06:45.300 --> 00:06:45.310 
the sense of community I never get the

00:06:45.310 --> 00:06:47.850 
the sense of community I never get the
feeling<00:06:45.490> that<00:06:45.759> there's<00:06:45.970> a<00:06:46.000> FIFA<00:06:46.560> community<00:06:47.560> or

00:06:47.850 --> 00:06:47.860 
feeling that there's a FIFA community or

00:06:47.860 --> 00:06:50.999 
feeling that there's a FIFA community or
a<00:06:48.599> FIFA<00:06:49.599> Manager<00:06:49.720> community<00:06:50.410> not<00:06:50.620> in<00:06:50.650> the<00:06:50.830> same

00:06:50.999 --> 00:06:51.009 
a FIFA Manager community not in the same

00:06:51.009 --> 00:06:53.309 
a FIFA Manager community not in the same
way<00:06:51.220> as<00:06:51.370> football<00:06:52.180> manager<00:06:52.630> and<00:06:52.810> although

00:06:53.309 --> 00:06:53.319 
way as football manager and although

00:06:53.319 --> 00:06:55.350 
way as football manager and although
people<00:06:53.889> keep<00:06:54.099> buying<00:06:54.280> the<00:06:54.520> games<00:06:54.759> I<00:06:55.000> don't<00:06:55.060> I

00:06:55.350 --> 00:06:55.360 
people keep buying the games I don't I

00:06:55.360 --> 00:06:57.150 
people keep buying the games I don't I
don't<00:06:55.630> feel<00:06:55.810> like<00:06:55.990> there's<00:06:56.139> that<00:06:56.289> same<00:06:56.830> sort

00:06:57.150 --> 00:06:57.160 
don't feel like there's that same sort

00:06:57.160 --> 00:06:58.680 
don't feel like there's that same sort
of<00:06:57.250> attachment<00:06:57.550> to<00:06:57.880> the<00:06:58.090> game<00:06:58.270> as<00:06:58.449> there<00:06:58.569> is

00:06:58.680 --> 00:06:58.690 
of attachment to the game as there is

00:06:58.690 --> 00:07:02.010 
of attachment to the game as there is
with<00:06:58.840> the<00:06:59.349> football<00:06:59.680> manager<00:07:00.099> I<00:07:00.789> think<00:07:01.750> it's

00:07:02.010 --> 00:07:02.020 
with the football manager I think it's

00:07:02.020 --> 00:07:03.360 
with the football manager I think it's
because<00:07:02.199> it's<00:07:02.349> so<00:07:02.470> immersive<00:07:02.800> I<00:07:03.039> mean<00:07:03.220> other

00:07:03.360 --> 00:07:03.370 
because it's so immersive I mean other

00:07:03.370 --> 00:07:05.100 
because it's so immersive I mean other
games<00:07:03.669> that<00:07:03.849> I've<00:07:04.150> kind<00:07:04.419> of<00:07:04.449> played<00:07:04.720> that<00:07:04.930> are

00:07:05.100 --> 00:07:05.110 
games that I've kind of played that are

00:07:05.110 --> 00:07:06.390 
games that I've kind of played that are
like<00:07:05.319> that<00:07:05.590> and<00:07:05.770> have<00:07:05.919> built<00:07:06.160> at<00:07:06.310> the

00:07:06.390 --> 00:07:06.400 
like that and have built at the

00:07:06.400 --> 00:07:09.089 
like that and have built at the
community<00:07:06.789> of<00:07:06.880> things<00:07:07.090> like<00:07:07.410> Sim<00:07:08.410> City<00:07:08.680> or

00:07:09.089 --> 00:07:09.099 
community of things like Sim City or

00:07:09.099 --> 00:07:12.900 
community of things like Sim City or
civilization<00:07:10.090> or<00:07:11.039> or<00:07:12.039> particular<00:07:12.460> kind<00:07:12.880> of

00:07:12.900 --> 00:07:12.910 
civilization or or particular kind of

00:07:12.910 --> 00:07:17.159 
civilization or or particular kind of
cult<00:07:13.240> games<00:07:13.630> that<00:07:14.020> were<00:07:15.240> easily<00:07:16.240> model<00:07:16.990> I

00:07:17.159 --> 00:07:17.169 
cult games that were easily model I

00:07:17.169 --> 00:07:18.300 
cult games that were easily model I
think<00:07:17.259> that's<00:07:17.650> one<00:07:17.830> of<00:07:17.860> the<00:07:17.949> things<00:07:18.190> that

00:07:18.300 --> 00:07:18.310 
think that's one of the things that

00:07:18.310 --> 00:07:19.890 
think that's one of the things that
football<00:07:18.550> managers<00:07:18.910> got<00:07:19.060> so<00:07:19.270> there<00:07:19.419> is<00:07:19.539> a<00:07:19.570> kind

00:07:19.890 --> 00:07:19.900 
football managers got so there is a kind

00:07:19.900 --> 00:07:21.749 
football managers got so there is a kind
of<00:07:19.930> community<00:07:20.229> input<00:07:20.590> into<00:07:20.830> data<00:07:21.190> updates

00:07:21.749 --> 00:07:21.759 
of community input into data updates

00:07:21.759 --> 00:07:23.999 
of community input into data updates
into<00:07:21.970> graphics<00:07:22.539> into<00:07:22.870> tactics<00:07:23.380> into<00:07:23.680> you<00:07:23.949> know

00:07:23.999 --> 00:07:24.009 
into graphics into tactics into you know

00:07:24.009 --> 00:07:24.990 
into graphics into tactics into you know
there's<00:07:24.160> all<00:07:24.250> sorts<00:07:24.490> of<00:07:24.520> things<00:07:24.669> that<00:07:24.789> you<00:07:24.880> can

00:07:24.990 --> 00:07:25.000 
there's all sorts of things that you can

00:07:25.000 --> 00:07:27.659 
there's all sorts of things that you can
share<00:07:25.270> and<00:07:25.330> and<00:07:25.720> talk<00:07:26.199> about<00:07:26.410> which<00:07:27.340> is<00:07:27.370> one<00:07:27.610> of

00:07:27.659 --> 00:07:27.669 
share and and talk about which is one of

00:07:27.669 --> 00:07:28.950 
share and and talk about which is one of
the<00:07:27.729> reasons<00:07:28.000> why<00:07:28.150> it<00:07:28.210> gets<00:07:28.389> such<00:07:28.539> community

00:07:28.950 --> 00:07:28.960 
the reasons why it gets such community

00:07:28.960 --> 00:07:30.810 
the reasons why it gets such community
but<00:07:29.110> people<00:07:29.470> buy<00:07:29.650> each<00:07:29.979> iteration<00:07:30.310> of<00:07:30.729> the

00:07:30.810 --> 00:07:30.820 
but people buy each iteration of the

00:07:30.820 --> 00:07:32.790 
but people buy each iteration of the
game<00:07:30.849> and<00:07:31.300> continued<00:07:32.139> the<00:07:32.229> discussions<00:07:32.650> from

00:07:32.790 --> 00:07:32.800 
game and continued the discussions from

00:07:32.800 --> 00:07:34.469 
game and continued the discussions from
before<00:07:33.130> because<00:07:33.460> it<00:07:33.580> is<00:07:33.729> kind<00:07:33.940> of<00:07:33.970> like<00:07:34.120> a<00:07:34.150> a

00:07:34.469 --> 00:07:34.479 
before because it is kind of like a a

00:07:34.479 --> 00:07:36.149 
before because it is kind of like a a
continuation<00:07:35.470> and<00:07:35.530> it's<00:07:35.650> not<00:07:35.770> that<00:07:35.889> kind<00:07:36.099> of

00:07:36.149 --> 00:07:36.159 
continuation and it's not that kind of

00:07:36.159 --> 00:07:37.409 
continuation and it's not that kind of
sense<00:07:36.340> that<00:07:36.460> every<00:07:36.759> game<00:07:36.909> is<00:07:37.000> completely

00:07:37.409 --> 00:07:37.419 
sense that every game is completely

00:07:37.419 --> 00:07:39.990 
sense that every game is completely
separate<00:07:38.020> and<00:07:38.310> completely<00:07:39.310> different<00:07:39.819> and

00:07:39.990 --> 00:07:40.000 
separate and completely different and

00:07:40.000 --> 00:07:41.100 
separate and completely different and
that<00:07:40.060> they've<00:07:40.240> just<00:07:40.479> added<00:07:40.810> all<00:07:40.900> these

00:07:41.100 --> 00:07:41.110 
that they've just added all these

00:07:41.110 --> 00:07:42.570 
that they've just added all these
different<00:07:41.440> features<00:07:41.710> just<00:07:41.979> for<00:07:42.099> the<00:07:42.220> sake<00:07:42.400> of

00:07:42.570 --> 00:07:42.580 
different features just for the sake of

00:07:42.580 --> 00:07:44.249 
different features just for the sake of
it<00:07:42.699> you<00:07:42.819> know<00:07:42.909> you<00:07:42.940> you<00:07:43.389> feel<00:07:43.630> like<00:07:43.840> each<00:07:44.020> game

00:07:44.249 --> 00:07:44.259 
it you know you you feel like each game

00:07:44.259 --> 00:07:46.409 
it you know you you feel like each game
as<00:07:44.409> a<00:07:44.440> progression<00:07:44.800> moving<00:07:45.280> on<00:07:45.430> the<00:07:46.120> fact<00:07:46.360> that

00:07:46.409 --> 00:07:46.419 
as a progression moving on the fact that

00:07:46.419 --> 00:07:47.990 
as a progression moving on the fact that
you<00:07:46.570> have<00:07:46.690> got<00:07:46.900> these<00:07:47.020> urban<00:07:47.380> myths<00:07:47.560> about

00:07:47.990 --> 00:07:48.000 
you have got these urban myths about

00:07:48.000 --> 00:07:50.189 
you have got these urban myths about
about<00:07:49.000> football<00:07:49.270> managing<00:07:49.659> good<00:07:49.780> and<00:07:49.960> bad<00:07:50.169> I

00:07:50.189 --> 00:07:50.199 
about football managing good and bad I

00:07:50.199 --> 00:07:51.719 
about football managing good and bad I
think<00:07:50.560> is<00:07:50.740> it's<00:07:50.979> just<00:07:51.039> a<00:07:51.220> testament<00:07:51.580> to<00:07:51.610> how

00:07:51.719 --> 00:07:51.729 
think is it's just a testament to how

00:07:51.729 --> 00:07:53.310 
think is it's just a testament to how
many<00:07:51.909> people<00:07:52.180> play<00:07:52.330> it<00:07:52.449> and<00:07:52.570> how<00:07:52.690> how

00:07:53.310 --> 00:07:53.320 
many people play it and how how

00:07:53.320 --> 00:07:54.990 
many people play it and how how
seriously<00:07:53.979> people<00:07:54.190> take<00:07:54.370> it<00:07:54.729> when<00:07:54.849> perhaps

00:07:54.990 --> 00:07:55.000 
seriously people take it when perhaps

00:07:55.000 --> 00:07:57.539 
seriously people take it when perhaps
they<00:07:55.240> shouldn't
