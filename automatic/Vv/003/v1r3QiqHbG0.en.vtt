00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.530
 [Music] 

00:00:00.320 --> 00:00:05.930
 If you have decided to adopt or buy a 

00:00:03.530 --> 00:00:08.480
 rabbit as a pet you have made a very 

00:00:05.930 --> 00:00:10.759
 good choice rabbits can be 

00:00:08.480 --> 00:00:12.950
 as loving and intelligent as others 

00:00:10.759 --> 00:00:15.200
 conventional pets and they need 

00:00:12.950 --> 00:00:17.990
 simple cares that will not take you 

00:00:15.200 --> 00:00:20.480
 a lot of time they are clean they wash themselves 

00:00:17.990 --> 00:00:23.359
 and they do not need you to take them out 

00:00:20.480 --> 00:00:27.410
 the street although you can make it clear that 

00:00:23.359 --> 00:00:30.289
 you have to get before or during the 

00:00:27.410 --> 00:00:32.509
 adoption or purchase because you need a 

00:00:30.289 --> 00:00:35.750
 Cage of a sufficient size 

00:00:32.509 --> 00:00:38.180
 big because the animal is going to need 

00:00:35.750 --> 00:00:40.879
 space to move when you're not in 

00:00:38.180 --> 00:00:43.039
 house and obviously also so that it does not 

00:00:40.879 --> 00:00:45.320
 overwhelm what will have to be inside 

00:00:43.039 --> 00:00:48.170
 the ecological bed cage that will be your 

00:00:45.320 --> 00:00:51.350
 base in or feed and a drinker of 

00:00:48.170 --> 00:00:54.050
 Pacifier to drink water in what place 

00:00:51.350 --> 00:00:56.480
 of the house this cage has to be located 

00:00:54.050 --> 00:00:58.370
 because your rabbit's cage has to 

00:00:56.480 --> 00:00:59.760
 be in a room that is well 

00:00:58.370 --> 00:01:02.160
 ventilated 

00:00:59.760 --> 00:01:04.559
 and where there is no current of 

00:01:02.160 --> 00:01:06.869
 direct air or heat sources since 

00:01:04.559 --> 00:01:09.899
 the rabbits bear very badly the high 

00:01:06.869 --> 00:01:12.869
 temperatures should also be 

00:01:09.899 --> 00:01:15.180
 away from other animals that could 

00:01:12.869 --> 00:01:19.470
 generate stress in the rabbit gene 

00:01:15.180 --> 00:01:21.360
 puntocom you have a post dedicated to this 

00:01:19.470 --> 00:01:24.420
 exclusively from where I indicate you with 

00:01:21.360 --> 00:01:26.610
 what animals get along and which ones 

00:01:24.420 --> 00:01:30.240
 give less confidence let's say it's 

00:01:26.610 --> 00:01:32.759
 important that whenever you can leave 

00:01:30.240 --> 00:01:36.119
 the door of his cage open so that 

00:01:32.759 --> 00:01:39.509
 come out and you can jump run and play your 

00:01:36.119 --> 00:01:42.000
 craving always under your supervision and 

00:01:39.509 --> 00:01:44.310
 removing all electrical cables and 

00:01:42.000 --> 00:01:46.710
 small objects that could be carried 

00:01:44.310 --> 00:01:49.830
 to the mouth or of value that could bite 

00:01:46.710 --> 00:01:52.709
 and spoil if you think it's possible that 

00:01:49.830 --> 00:01:55.890
 escape through some gap purchase grid 

00:01:52.709 --> 00:01:58.229
 and a few bridles to close them off 

00:01:55.890 --> 00:01:59.940
 the way that I did and you can see in 

00:01:58.229 --> 00:02:02.460
 the images 

00:01:59.940 --> 00:02:05.190
 in addition to the mentioned feeding 

00:02:02.460 --> 00:02:08.040
 You can add to your diet certain 

00:02:05.190 --> 00:02:11.370
 fruits and vegetables as well as the typical 

00:02:08.040 --> 00:02:13.800
 snacks the bars with honey that you can 

00:02:11.370 --> 00:02:16.650
 give it when it behaves well or when you 

00:02:13.800 --> 00:02:18.540
 consider timely and good 

00:02:16.650 --> 00:02:20.640
 practically that's what you're going to 

00:02:18.540 --> 00:02:22.650
 need 

00:02:20.640 --> 00:02:25.590
 from the beginning you have to let it 

00:02:22.650 --> 00:02:27.900
 approach you as he sees fit not to 

00:02:25.590 --> 00:02:31.170
 You must torment him at all because that 

00:02:27.900 --> 00:02:34.050
 it will be counterproductive to your 

00:02:31.170 --> 00:02:36.870
 relationship and you will have to earn their trust 

00:02:34.050 --> 00:02:40.380
 little by little and treat him 

00:02:36.870 --> 00:02:43.890
 gentle way since they are very animal 

00:02:40.380 --> 00:02:45.300
 sensitive that get scared very easily 

00:02:43.890 --> 00:02:47.820
 Finally, you have to take into account 

00:02:45.300 --> 00:02:51.290
 also that you must have your cage 

00:02:47.820 --> 00:02:53.700
 clean take good care of your diet 

00:02:51.290 --> 00:02:57.030
 provide them with games and an environment 

00:02:53.700 --> 00:02:58.860
 Quiet give him a lot of love and enjoy 

00:02:57.030 --> 00:03:02.790
 to the maximum of the time you can spend 

00:02:58.860 --> 00:03:05.310
 with him because if not when he is no longer 

00:03:02.790 --> 00:03:07.890
 you can regret not having done it 

00:03:05.310 --> 00:03:10.290
 that you have any doubt then leave your 

00:03:07.890 --> 00:03:12.630
