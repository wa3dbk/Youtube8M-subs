00:00:04.640 --> 00:00:11.419
 Now let's look at the questions 

00:00:07.410 --> 00:00:15.299
 came by twitter for juno 

00:00:11.419 --> 00:00:18.390
 luca fischer asks you play fifa 13 

00:00:15.299 --> 00:00:19.970
 and if so how it is to itself 

00:00:18.390 --> 00:00:22.830
 play 

00:00:19.970 --> 00:00:25.980
 So of course I'm fifa so me 

00:00:22.830 --> 00:00:27.480
 believe 80 percent play fifa in here 

00:00:25.980 --> 00:00:28.500
 the team and we play too 

00:00:27.480 --> 00:00:30.600
 then here against each other 

00:00:28.500 --> 00:00:32.070
 but we do not play who that was 

00:00:30.600 --> 00:00:34.679
 already funny okay okay 

00:00:32.070 --> 00:00:36.749
 second question comes from lola without 

00:00:34.679 --> 00:00:38.699
 surnames what do you value most? 

00:00:36.749 --> 00:00:40.260
 werder bremen yes the cohesion 

00:00:38.699 --> 00:00:41.850
 of course , but actually is from the 

00:00:40.260 --> 00:00:45.149
 first day already felt that 

00:00:41.850 --> 00:00:47.039
 Here is one more a small family 

00:00:45.149 --> 00:00:49.319
 there is where everyone is there for the other 

00:00:47.039 --> 00:00:50.640
 So if you have problems and stuff 

00:00:49.319 --> 00:00:52.620
 that is always supported by that 

00:00:50.640 --> 00:00:54.510
 actually very important and I say that 

00:00:52.620 --> 00:00:56.249
 climate is so much better 

00:00:54.510 --> 00:00:57.569
 were also still in the spring and there 

00:00:56.249 --> 00:00:59.579
 you actually feel like picking up and that 

00:00:57.569 --> 00:01:03.949
 I think the most important thing ok the 

00:00:59.579 --> 00:01:05.970
 Last question comes from Tim Borowski 

00:01:03.949 --> 00:01:10.140
 ask how did you decide on the departure of 

00:01:05.970 --> 00:01:11.909
 Klaus Allofs yes reacts actually was 

00:01:10.140 --> 00:01:15.000
 it is not then not so now 

00:01:11.909 --> 00:01:16.439
 Ultimately, we got over that 

00:01:15.000 --> 00:01:18.390
 It's always over the media 

00:01:16.439 --> 00:01:20.759
 been speculated and then more or 

00:01:18.390 --> 00:01:23.039
 less than that fit together 

00:01:20.759 --> 00:01:25.979
 whether he goes or not and of that 

00:01:23.039 --> 00:01:28.979
 ago so how's just the way football or system 

00:01:25.979 --> 00:01:31.289
 sources one goes one comes and of the 

00:01:28.979 --> 00:01:31.770
 You have to be professional with that 

00:01:31.289 --> 00:01:34.649
 bypass 

00:01:31.770 --> 00:01:36.119
 we have other tasks here and we 

00:01:34.649 --> 00:01:37.590
 focus on ourselves that 

00:01:36.119 --> 00:01:41.159
 I believe the most important thing is that we 

00:01:37.590 --> 00:01:43.350
 are successful and you can only good 

00:01:41.159 --> 00:01:45.149
 wish I had built up a lot here 

00:01:43.350 --> 00:01:47.399
 I was very successful, too 

00:01:45.149 --> 00:01:49.710
 you should not be the bad either 

00:01:47.399 --> 00:01:51.780
 So that's not the case at all 

00:01:49.710 --> 00:01:54.750
 case i think you should be very positive 

00:01:51.780 --> 00:01:56.369
 see but as I said the position will 

00:01:54.750 --> 00:01:57.869
 re-staffed and we can each other 

00:01:56.369 --> 00:02:02.060
 focus on us as the most important 

00:01:57.869 --> 00:02:02.060
 how do you say so nice here in bremen yes 

00:02:03.340 --> 00:02:08.600
 they say you are so beautiful here in bremen 

00:02:05.900 --> 00:02:11.300
 Life goes on, so let's go 

00:02:08.600 --> 00:02:13.600
 Hook behind it and let's have a look 

00:02:11.300 --> 00:02:13.600
 ahead
