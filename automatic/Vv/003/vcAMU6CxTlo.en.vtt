00:00:07.029 --> 00:00:12.710
 no no no 

00:00:10.910 --> 00:00:14.870
 now everything is installed the neighborhood and you 

00:00:12.710 --> 00:00:19.009
 I bring a tutorial on how to find the 

00:00:14.870 --> 00:00:22.520
 library folder on a mac since that 

00:00:19.009 --> 00:00:24.500
 folder is what controls everything in 

00:00:22.520 --> 00:00:27.109
 the games and take off that put some 

00:00:24.500 --> 00:00:29.630
 mode according to part readings and so on 

00:00:27.109 --> 00:00:32.210
 well first we must make visible 

00:00:29.630 --> 00:00:35.180
 the hidden files for this we will have 

00:00:32.210 --> 00:00:37.630
 what to look for in the application determines 

00:00:35.180 --> 00:00:40.570
 We give spotlight we write 

00:00:37.630 --> 00:00:43.890
 terminal and it will appear to me as the 

00:00:40.570 --> 00:00:43.890
 result we open it 

00:00:44.400 --> 00:00:49.440
 we wait for it to load and we have to 

00:00:47.010 --> 00:00:52.400
 write the following I put it here in 

00:00:49.440 --> 00:00:55.140
 great for you to see it is perfect 

00:00:52.400 --> 00:00:57.410
 to show you will have to put first 

00:00:55.140 --> 00:01:00.390
 this 

00:00:57.410 --> 00:01:05.880
 what copy is command c 

00:01:00.390 --> 00:01:10.380
 command v you hit that enter 

00:01:05.880 --> 00:01:13.310
 copy and sixth hour command c command v 

00:01:10.380 --> 00:01:13.310
 you stick it 

00:01:14.700 --> 00:01:19.259
 once the restore 

00:01:16.920 --> 00:01:21.780
 the desk because we already saw I do not have 

00:01:19.259 --> 00:01:24.390
 nothing but when you do 

00:01:21.780 --> 00:01:26.670
 the applications are oxidized a moment 

00:01:24.390 --> 00:01:30.180
 you worry you will come out again only 

00:01:26.670 --> 00:01:32.280
 as if it restarted a little bit 

00:01:30.180 --> 00:01:36.140
 then now recount the folder not 

00:01:32.280 --> 00:01:36.140
 we are going to find is 

00:01:36.760 --> 00:01:42.039
 a window will open 

00:01:39.909 --> 00:01:45.399
 and here we go to your name 

00:01:42.039 --> 00:01:46.719
 user in this case in these and you see that 

00:01:45.399 --> 00:01:49.119
 have come out a lot of files that 

00:01:46.719 --> 00:01:51.460
 before they were not like that anymore 

00:01:49.119 --> 00:01:52.869
 those are the hidden files working 

00:01:51.460 --> 00:01:55.509
 normally the operating system does not 

00:01:52.869 --> 00:01:58.000
 It is visible at first sight because they are 

00:01:55.509 --> 00:01:59.020
 important for the program if such and 

00:01:58.000 --> 00:02:01.950
 we have to find one that puts 

00:01:59.020 --> 00:02:01.950
 bookstore 

00:02:03.300 --> 00:02:09.100
 olay break if you have it in English 

00:02:06.550 --> 00:02:11.650
 and well I'm here because you would have everything 

00:02:09.100 --> 00:02:13.989
 what those programs 

00:02:11.650 --> 00:02:17.319
 etcetera then already if you want some game 

00:02:13.989 --> 00:02:18.909
 and so they put support application and 

00:02:17.319 --> 00:02:22.510
 here, you all come for example 

00:02:18.909 --> 00:02:25.780
 which is minecraft or some of those 

00:02:22.510 --> 00:02:28.810
 first of all tell you then for 

00:02:25.780 --> 00:02:31.470
 to hide them again you will have to 

00:02:28.810 --> 00:02:31.470
 copy this 

00:02:32.470 --> 00:02:41.049
 but copied with twisting 

00:02:36.290 --> 00:02:41.049
 and copy it copy this 

00:02:44.080 --> 00:02:48.820
 copy it back to do the same thing on 

00:02:46.510 --> 00:02:51.000
 flickering of images and files 

00:02:48.820 --> 00:02:51.000
 hidden 

00:02:53.740 --> 00:02:59.680
 they will go back to hide what you see if I give 

00:02:57.190 --> 00:03:02.140
 here my user did not know me 

00:02:59.680 --> 00:03:04.810
 what I did before taking it again 

00:03:02.140 --> 00:03:06.820
 is the library folder put it here for 

00:03:04.810 --> 00:03:10.890
 have it a direct access without having to 

00:03:06.820 --> 00:03:10.890
 have hidden files visible 

00:03:11.840 --> 00:03:15.849

00:03:13.819 --> 00:03:18.170
