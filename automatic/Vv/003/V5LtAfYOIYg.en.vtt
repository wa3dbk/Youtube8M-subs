00:01:41.020 --> 00:01:41.030 
feedback that we're getting from

00:01:41.030 --> 00:01:43.969 
feedback that we're getting from
television<00:01:42.030> networks<00:01:42.420> if<00:01:43.110> they<00:01:43.439> deal<00:01:43.710> in<00:01:43.740> a

00:01:43.969 --> 00:01:43.979 
television networks if they deal in a

00:01:43.979 --> 00:01:48.410 
television networks if they deal in a
1440<00:01:45.710> 1080<00:01:46.710> kind<00:01:46.920> of<00:01:46.979> signal<00:01:47.310> 1920<00:01:48.090> so

00:01:48.410 --> 00:01:48.420 
1440 1080 kind of signal 1920 so

00:01:48.420 --> 00:01:49.730 
1440 1080 kind of signal 1920 so
firmware<00:01:48.750> upgrade<00:01:49.020> will<00:01:49.170> give<00:01:49.350> them<00:01:49.530> another

00:01:49.730 --> 00:01:49.740 
firmware upgrade will give them another

00:01:49.740 --> 00:01:52.310 
firmware upgrade will give them another
compression<00:01:50.280> another<00:01:50.689> file<00:01:51.689> size<00:01:51.930> to<00:01:52.020> record

00:01:52.310 --> 00:01:52.320 
compression another file size to record

00:01:52.320 --> 00:01:53.870 
compression another file size to record
which<00:01:52.439> is<00:01:52.560> working<00:01:52.740> 40<00:01:53.009> along<00:01:53.220> with<00:01:53.340> the<00:01:53.399> 1980

00:01:53.870 --> 00:01:53.880 
which is working 40 along with the 1980

00:01:53.880 --> 00:01:56.840 
which is working 40 along with the 1980
and<00:01:54.090> then<00:01:54.450> as<00:01:54.990> well<00:01:55.290> as<00:01:55.560> what<00:01:56.490> we<00:01:56.549> did<00:01:56.700> on<00:01:56.790> the

00:01:56.840 --> 00:01:56.850 
and then as well as what we did on the

00:01:56.850 --> 00:01:59.179 
and then as well as what we did on the
seat<00:01:57.060> 100<00:01:57.810> was<00:01:57.990> put<00:01:58.290> in<00:01:58.409> auto<00:01:58.590> focus<00:01:59.009> in<00:01:59.130> the

00:01:59.179 --> 00:01:59.189 
seat 100 was put in auto focus in the

00:01:59.189 --> 00:02:01.789 
seat 100 was put in auto focus in the
100<00:01:59.640> so<00:02:00.180> and<00:02:00.899> also<00:02:01.079> the<00:02:01.290> other<00:02:01.380> thing<00:02:01.500> is<00:02:01.680> the

00:02:01.789 --> 00:02:01.799 
100 so and also the other thing is the

00:02:01.799 --> 00:02:03.499 
100 so and also the other thing is the
magnification<00:02:02.460> you<00:02:02.850> know<00:02:02.969> be<00:02:03.119> able<00:02:03.180> to<00:02:03.299> adjust

00:02:03.499 --> 00:02:03.509 
magnification you know be able to adjust

00:02:03.509 --> 00:02:04.880 
magnification you know be able to adjust
it<00:02:03.630> with<00:02:03.659> the<00:02:03.869> joystick<00:02:04.530> so<00:02:04.649> it's<00:02:04.740> not<00:02:04.829> just

00:02:04.880 --> 00:02:04.890 
it with the joystick so it's not just

00:02:04.890 --> 00:02:06.889 
it with the joystick so it's not just
into<00:02:05.610> one<00:02:05.759> spot<00:02:05.969> yeah<00:02:06.329> I<00:02:06.360> mean<00:02:06.600> we<00:02:06.689> can<00:02:06.840> do

00:02:06.889 --> 00:02:06.899 
into one spot yeah I mean we can do

00:02:06.899 --> 00:02:08.359 
into one spot yeah I mean we can do
magnification<00:02:07.560> but<00:02:07.649> now<00:02:07.740> magnifies<00:02:08.190> the

00:02:08.359 --> 00:02:08.369 
magnification but now magnifies the

00:02:08.369 --> 00:02:09.650 
magnification but now magnifies the
center<00:02:08.670> so<00:02:08.970> you'll<00:02:09.060> be<00:02:09.119> able<00:02:09.149> to<00:02:09.330> move<00:02:09.450> that

00:02:09.650 --> 00:02:09.660 
center so you'll be able to move that

00:02:09.660 --> 00:02:09.960 
center so you'll be able to move that
man

00:02:09.960 --> 00:02:09.970 
man

00:02:09.970 --> 00:02:11.910 
man
maybe<00:02:10.630> where<00:02:10.840> your<00:02:10.990> focus<00:02:11.170> point<00:02:11.500> wants<00:02:11.650> to<00:02:11.770> be

00:02:11.910 --> 00:02:11.920 
maybe where your focus point wants to be

00:02:11.920 --> 00:02:13.530 
maybe where your focus point wants to be
so<00:02:12.490> if<00:02:12.670> you're<00:02:12.790> framing<00:02:13.030> up<00:02:13.210> you're<00:02:13.360> looking

00:02:13.530 --> 00:02:13.540 
so if you're framing up you're looking

00:02:13.540 --> 00:02:14.850 
so if you're framing up you're looking
for<00:02:13.630> where<00:02:13.750> the<00:02:13.840> critical<00:02:14.200> focus<00:02:14.320> point<00:02:14.740> is

00:02:14.850 --> 00:02:14.860 
for where the critical focus point is

00:02:14.860 --> 00:02:16.740 
for where the critical focus point is
banging<00:02:15.550> in<00:02:15.640> and<00:02:15.790> that<00:02:15.910> really<00:02:16.120> plays<00:02:16.390> big<00:02:16.630> in

00:02:16.740 --> 00:02:16.750 
banging in and that really plays big in

00:02:16.750 --> 00:02:18.540 
banging in and that really plays big in
a<00:02:16.810> 4k<00:02:17.170> cuz<00:02:17.350> you<00:02:17.440> got<00:02:17.590> to<00:02:17.710> beat<00:02:17.800> a<00:02:18.010> con<00:02:18.250> if<00:02:18.460> you're

00:02:18.540 --> 00:02:18.550 
a 4k cuz you got to beat a con if you're

00:02:18.550 --> 00:02:20.220 
a 4k cuz you got to beat a con if you're
going<00:02:18.640> to<00:02:18.700> play<00:02:18.790> in<00:02:18.880> the<00:02:18.970> 4k<00:02:19.240> world<00:02:19.450> so<00:02:19.810> there's

00:02:20.220 --> 00:02:20.230 
going to play in the 4k world so there's

00:02:20.230 --> 00:02:21.660 
going to play in the 4k world so there's
so<00:02:20.440> many<00:02:20.530> features<00:02:20.920> that<00:02:21.010> if<00:02:21.220> we<00:02:21.310> had<00:02:21.430> all<00:02:21.520> day

00:02:21.660 --> 00:02:21.670 
so many features that if we had all day

00:02:21.670 --> 00:02:23.760 
so many features that if we had all day
to<00:02:21.700> talk<00:02:21.910> about<00:02:22.090> you<00:02:22.690> know<00:02:22.780> on<00:02:22.990> the<00:02:23.110> c300<00:02:23.440> that

00:02:23.760 --> 00:02:23.770 
to talk about you know on the c300 that

00:02:23.770 --> 00:02:25.170 
to talk about you know on the c300 that
makes<00:02:23.920> shooting<00:02:24.130> especially<00:02:24.880> those<00:02:25.030> are

00:02:25.170 --> 00:02:25.180 
makes shooting especially those are

00:02:25.180 --> 00:02:26.760 
makes shooting especially those are
coming<00:02:25.540> from<00:02:25.630> like<00:02:25.840> myself<00:02:26.200> we<00:02:26.500> were<00:02:26.620> shooting

00:02:26.760 --> 00:02:26.770 
coming from like myself we were shooting

00:02:26.770 --> 00:02:28.440 
coming from like myself we were shooting
on<00:02:26.980> the<00:02:27.040> mark<00:02:27.220> two<00:02:27.400> it<00:02:27.820> was<00:02:27.940> a<00:02:28.000> great<00:02:28.210> camera

00:02:28.440 --> 00:02:28.450 
on the mark two it was a great camera

00:02:28.450 --> 00:02:29.700 
on the mark two it was a great camera
but<00:02:28.720> there's<00:02:28.870> a<00:02:28.930> lot<00:02:29.050> of<00:02:29.080> things<00:02:29.260> that<00:02:29.470> we<00:02:29.560> wish

00:02:29.700 --> 00:02:29.710 
but there's a lot of things that we wish

00:02:29.710 --> 00:02:32.280 
but there's a lot of things that we wish
we<00:02:29.890> had<00:02:30.100> and<00:02:30.370> the<00:02:30.790> c300<00:02:31.180> really<00:02:31.720> fulfilled<00:02:32.080> all

00:02:32.280 --> 00:02:32.290 
we had and the c300 really fulfilled all

00:02:32.290 --> 00:02:34.080 
we had and the c300 really fulfilled all
of<00:02:32.320> our<00:02:32.530> needs<00:02:32.680> for<00:02:32.830> it<00:02:33.100> and<00:02:33.310> again<00:02:33.820> it's<00:02:34.000> in
