00:00:07.580 --> 00:00:12.920
 very good everyone I am variant 10 and today 

00:00:10.610 --> 00:00:15.410
 I bring you a new walk break and inka 

00:00:12.920 --> 00:00:18.320
 playful and good what we are going to do is 

00:00:15.410 --> 00:00:20.090
 take off the ballistic vest or the 

00:00:18.320 --> 00:00:23.150
 package d 

00:00:20.090 --> 00:00:25.670
 of weapons are worth we put those gusts 

00:00:23.150 --> 00:00:27.380
 we'll have to take them out and well once 

00:00:25.670 --> 00:00:29.600
 that we have it is worth this time what 

00:00:27.380 --> 00:00:32.750
 is going to place cs what we will have to place 

00:00:29.600 --> 00:00:34.730
 right there in the car this one that 

00:00:32.750 --> 00:00:37.280
 move by clicking on the button that you will now see 

00:00:34.730 --> 00:00:39.410
 we will have to place it like this with 

00:00:37.280 --> 00:00:41.720
 very careful and good now we will come 

00:00:39.410 --> 00:00:43.890
 here to the button to operate the trolley 

00:00:41.720 --> 00:00:46.890
 To move 

00:00:43.890 --> 00:00:51.120
 and well I already thank you that acs and 

00:00:46.890 --> 00:00:54.750
 that helped me do the trick of the 

00:00:51.120 --> 00:00:57.149
 tubes stinging and so on and well now what 

00:00:54.750 --> 00:00:59.250
 What we have to do is to give 

00:00:57.149 --> 00:01:01.080
 square little by little until getting 

00:00:59.250 --> 00:01:03.089
 inside the parking lot as you see ips 

00:01:01.080 --> 00:01:05.080
 what has happened has already been 

00:01:03.089 --> 00:01:07.120
 that the truck is still 

00:01:05.080 --> 00:01:09.670
 walking so we'll have to do it 

00:01:07.120 --> 00:01:11.920
 just at the end it's worth nothing to keep 

00:01:09.670 --> 00:01:14.950
 to park at the end of the 

00:01:11.920 --> 00:01:17.050
 hallway and good as you see I have done 

00:01:14.950 --> 00:01:19.810
 ok you'll just have to go give it 

00:01:17.050 --> 00:01:22.680
 little by little squared like the trick 

00:01:19.810 --> 00:01:26.050
 what we did on the other multiplayer map 

00:01:22.680 --> 00:01:28.270
 that we did not leave the map and well it's a 

00:01:26.050 --> 00:01:29.380
 trick pretty easy now we 

00:01:28.270 --> 00:01:32.170
 we will be here inside the van 

00:01:29.380 --> 00:01:33.580
 where they can not kill us just 

00:01:32.170 --> 00:01:36.070
 they can kill if they bend over and we 

00:01:33.580 --> 00:01:38.200
 they install the feet but good in theory 

00:01:36.070 --> 00:01:40.630
 in a multiplayer game we are not going to 

00:01:38.200 --> 00:01:42.190
 let it approach so do not 

00:01:40.630 --> 00:01:45.370
 you will have problems here you will be 

00:01:42.190 --> 00:01:47.170
 immortal and good as you can see they are 

00:01:45.370 --> 00:01:49.360
 shooting does not give me unless it's 

00:01:47.170 --> 00:01:51.520
 Crouch as I said and now you will see 

00:01:49.360 --> 00:01:53.200
 How can I kill from within 

00:01:51.520 --> 00:01:55.570
 ok but you liked it now 

00:01:53.200 --> 00:01:58.630
 you do as another perspective give a like 

00:01:55.570 --> 00:02:01.860
 this' favorites subscribe and see you 

00:01:58.630 --> 00:02:01.860
 in the next video 

00:02:29.220 --> 00:02:31.760

00:03:02.930 --> 00:03:06.219
