in<00:00:00.149> this<00:00:00.390> video<00:00:00.719> we're<00:00:00.960> going<00:00:01.050> to<00:00:01.110> come<00:00:01.260> up

00:00:01.340 --> 00:00:01.350 
in this video we're going to come up

00:00:01.350 --> 00:00:03.500 
in this video we're going to come up
with<00:00:01.500> an<00:00:01.620> approximation<00:00:01.890> as<00:00:02.610> to<00:00:02.850> how<00:00:03.030> fast<00:00:03.270> the

00:00:03.500 --> 00:00:03.510 
with an approximation as to how fast the

00:00:03.510 --> 00:00:05.210 
with an approximation as to how fast the
person<00:00:03.929> standing<00:00:04.319> on<00:00:04.440> the<00:00:04.589> equator<00:00:05.040> of<00:00:05.130> the

00:00:05.210 --> 00:00:05.220 
person standing on the equator of the

00:00:05.220 --> 00:00:07.249 
person standing on the equator of the
earth<00:00:05.279> is<00:00:05.609> rotated<00:00:06.210> about<00:00:06.390> the<00:00:06.569> Earth's<00:00:06.810> axis

00:00:07.249 --> 00:00:07.259 
earth is rotated about the Earth's axis

00:00:07.259 --> 00:00:09.440 
earth is rotated about the Earth's axis
every<00:00:07.470> 24<00:00:07.890> hours<00:00:08.400> so<00:00:08.910> we<00:00:09.059> know<00:00:09.179> the<00:00:09.300> Earth

00:00:09.440 --> 00:00:09.450 
every 24 hours so we know the Earth

00:00:09.450 --> 00:00:10.459 
every 24 hours so we know the Earth
rotates<00:00:09.900> in<00:00:10.110> the<00:00:10.200> counterclockwise

00:00:10.459 --> 00:00:10.469 
rotates in the counterclockwise

00:00:10.469 --> 00:00:11.330 
rotates in the counterclockwise
direction

00:00:11.330 --> 00:00:11.340 
direction

00:00:11.340 --> 00:00:13.160 
direction
and<00:00:11.490> one<00:00:12.090> of<00:00:12.179> the<00:00:12.240> things<00:00:12.540> that<00:00:12.690> we'd<00:00:12.809> like<00:00:13.019> to

00:00:13.160 --> 00:00:13.170 
and one of the things that we'd like to

00:00:13.170 --> 00:00:15.320 
and one of the things that we'd like to
distinguish<00:00:13.650> is<00:00:13.769> that<00:00:14.009> a<00:00:14.160> person<00:00:14.940> standing

00:00:15.320 --> 00:00:15.330 
distinguish is that a person standing

00:00:15.330 --> 00:00:17.000 
distinguish is that a person standing
here<00:00:15.509> on<00:00:15.599> the<00:00:15.690> equator<00:00:16.049> actually<00:00:16.830> has<00:00:16.980> a

00:00:17.000 --> 00:00:17.010 
here on the equator actually has a

00:00:17.010 --> 00:00:18.769 
here on the equator actually has a
smaller<00:00:17.550> what's<00:00:17.850> called<00:00:18.060> tangential

00:00:18.769 --> 00:00:18.779 
smaller what's called tangential

00:00:18.779 --> 00:00:20.900 
smaller what's called tangential
velocity<00:00:19.260> than<00:00:19.650> a<00:00:19.680> person<00:00:20.070> standing<00:00:20.460> here<00:00:20.789> on

00:00:20.900 --> 00:00:20.910 
velocity than a person standing here on

00:00:20.910 --> 00:00:23.570 
velocity than a person standing here on
the<00:00:21.000> earth<00:00:21.180> even<00:00:21.480> though<00:00:21.779> both<00:00:22.109> people<00:00:22.830> rotate

00:00:23.570 --> 00:00:23.580 
the earth even though both people rotate

00:00:23.580 --> 00:00:25.730 
the earth even though both people rotate
on<00:00:23.730> the<00:00:23.820> Earth's<00:00:23.970> axis<00:00:24.420> once<00:00:24.720> every<00:00:24.810> 24<00:00:24.960> hours

00:00:25.730 --> 00:00:25.740 
on the Earth's axis once every 24 hours

00:00:25.740 --> 00:00:27.470 
on the Earth's axis once every 24 hours
so<00:00:26.099> the<00:00:26.220> velocity<00:00:26.340> of<00:00:26.640> this<00:00:26.820> person<00:00:27.240> is<00:00:27.330> often

00:00:27.470 --> 00:00:27.480 
so the velocity of this person is often

00:00:27.480 --> 00:00:29.089 
so the velocity of this person is often
referred<00:00:27.869> to<00:00:27.900> as<00:00:28.140> the<00:00:28.349> tangential<00:00:29.010> velocity

00:00:29.089 --> 00:00:29.099 
referred to as the tangential velocity

00:00:29.099 --> 00:00:31.910 
referred to as the tangential velocity
and<00:00:30.000> what<00:00:30.359> you<00:00:30.510> should<00:00:30.689> note<00:00:30.869> is<00:00:31.019> that<00:00:31.740> the

00:00:31.910 --> 00:00:31.920 
and what you should note is that the

00:00:31.920 --> 00:00:34.280 
and what you should note is that the
tangential<00:00:32.430> velocity<00:00:32.750> decreases<00:00:33.750> as<00:00:34.020> you<00:00:34.050> get

00:00:34.280 --> 00:00:34.290 
tangential velocity decreases as you get

00:00:34.290 --> 00:00:35.870 
tangential velocity decreases as you get
closer<00:00:34.559> and<00:00:34.680> closer<00:00:34.920> to<00:00:35.160> the<00:00:35.280> poles<00:00:35.550> of<00:00:35.790> a

00:00:35.870 --> 00:00:35.880 
closer and closer to the poles of a

00:00:35.880 --> 00:00:37.850 
closer and closer to the poles of a
planet<00:00:36.329> now<00:00:36.630> the<00:00:37.050> distance<00:00:37.380> between<00:00:37.559> the

00:00:37.850 --> 00:00:37.860 
planet now the distance between the

00:00:37.860 --> 00:00:39.740 
planet now the distance between the
center<00:00:38.250> of<00:00:38.340> the<00:00:38.399> earth<00:00:38.430> and<00:00:38.850> a<00:00:39.300> person<00:00:39.660> who's

00:00:39.740 --> 00:00:39.750 
center of the earth and a person who's

00:00:39.750 --> 00:00:43.330 
center of the earth and a person who's
standing<00:00:39.960> along<00:00:40.170> the<00:00:40.260> equator<00:00:40.620> is<00:00:41.160> about<00:00:42.170> 6378

00:00:43.330 --> 00:00:43.340 
standing along the equator is about 6378

00:00:43.340 --> 00:00:45.860 
standing along the equator is about 6378
kilometers<00:00:44.340> and<00:00:44.520> what<00:00:44.700> we<00:00:44.820> want<00:00:45.030> to<00:00:45.090> do<00:00:45.210> is<00:00:45.420> we

00:00:45.860 --> 00:00:45.870 
kilometers and what we want to do is we

00:00:45.870 --> 00:00:47.510 
kilometers and what we want to do is we
want<00:00:46.050> to<00:00:46.140> calculate<00:00:46.350> what<00:00:46.860> the<00:00:47.070> person's

00:00:47.510 --> 00:00:47.520 
want to calculate what the person's

00:00:47.520 --> 00:00:50.420 
want to calculate what the person's
tangential<00:00:48.149> velocity<00:00:48.600> is<00:00:48.719> in<00:00:49.289> miles<00:00:50.010> per<00:00:50.280> hour

00:00:50.420 --> 00:00:50.430 
tangential velocity is in miles per hour

00:00:50.430 --> 00:00:52.430 
tangential velocity is in miles per hour
so<00:00:51.090> what<00:00:51.329> we<00:00:51.449> first<00:00:51.750> need<00:00:51.899> to<00:00:51.989> do<00:00:52.110> is<00:00:52.260> multiply

00:00:52.430 --> 00:00:52.440 
so what we first need to do is multiply

00:00:52.440 --> 00:00:55.060 
so what we first need to do is multiply
this<00:00:52.879> distance<00:00:53.879> by<00:00:54.360> a<00:00:54.390> conversion<00:00:54.840> factor

00:00:55.060 --> 00:00:55.070 
this distance by a conversion factor

00:00:55.070 --> 00:00:57.290 
this distance by a conversion factor
converting<00:00:56.070> this<00:00:56.250> over<00:00:56.579> to<00:00:56.699> units<00:00:56.969> of<00:00:57.030> miles

00:00:57.290 --> 00:00:57.300 
converting this over to units of miles

00:00:57.300 --> 00:01:00.069 
converting this over to units of miles
so<00:00:57.809> you<00:00:58.199> should<00:00:58.379> know<00:00:58.469> that<00:00:58.620> there<00:00:58.800> are<00:00:58.969> 1.61

00:01:00.069 --> 00:01:00.079 
so you should know that there are 1.61

00:01:00.079 --> 00:01:03.319 
so you should know that there are 1.61
kilometers<00:01:01.079> in<00:01:01.350> every<00:01:02.129> one<00:01:02.340> mile<00:01:02.670> and<00:01:03.030> when

00:01:03.319 --> 00:01:03.329 
kilometers in every one mile and when

00:01:03.329 --> 00:01:05.329 
kilometers in every one mile and when
you<00:01:03.420> do<00:01:03.539> this<00:01:03.660> conversion<00:01:04.080> out<00:01:04.500> you<00:01:04.830> get<00:01:05.010> the

00:01:05.329 --> 00:01:05.339 
you do this conversion out you get the

00:01:05.339 --> 00:01:07.310 
you do this conversion out you get the
units<00:01:05.640> of<00:01:05.729> kilometers<00:01:06.150> cancel<00:01:06.630> out<00:01:06.750> and<00:01:06.960> then

00:01:07.310 --> 00:01:07.320 
units of kilometers cancel out and then

00:01:07.320 --> 00:01:12.710 
units of kilometers cancel out and then
you<00:01:07.439> get<00:01:08.990> 6378<00:01:09.990> miles<00:01:11.030> divided<00:01:12.030> by<00:01:12.119> one<00:01:12.479> point

00:01:12.710 --> 00:01:12.720 
you get 6378 miles divided by one point

00:01:12.720 --> 00:01:14.660 
you get 6378 miles divided by one point
six<00:01:13.020> one<00:01:13.260> and<00:01:13.470> when<00:01:13.770> you<00:01:13.860> divide<00:01:14.100> that<00:01:14.130> out<00:01:14.310> you

00:01:14.660 --> 00:01:14.670 
six one and when you divide that out you

00:01:14.670 --> 00:01:15.980 
six one and when you divide that out you
get<00:01:14.820> about<00:01:15.000> three<00:01:15.240> thousand<00:01:15.720> nine<00:01:15.750> hundred

00:01:15.980 --> 00:01:15.990 
get about three thousand nine hundred

00:01:15.990 --> 00:01:18.770 
get about three thousand nine hundred
and<00:01:16.170> sixty<00:01:16.320> one<00:01:16.770> mile<00:01:17.189> so<00:01:17.640> this<00:01:17.820> is<00:01:18.000> the<00:01:18.240> radius

00:01:18.770 --> 00:01:18.780 
and sixty one mile so this is the radius

00:01:18.780 --> 00:01:20.690 
and sixty one mile so this is the radius
of<00:01:19.110> the<00:01:19.229> earth<00:01:19.259> expressed<00:01:19.890> in<00:01:20.040> units<00:01:20.310> of<00:01:20.400> miles

00:01:20.690 --> 00:01:20.700 
of the earth expressed in units of miles

00:01:20.700 --> 00:01:22.880 
of the earth expressed in units of miles

00:01:24.770 --> 00:01:24.780 
the earth doesn't just travel three

00:01:24.780 --> 00:01:27.140 
the earth doesn't just travel three
thousand<00:01:25.170> nine<00:01:25.200> hundred<00:01:25.409> sixty<00:01:25.770> one<00:01:25.979> miles<00:01:26.250> in

about the Earth's axis and in this case
they're<00:01:33.000> going<00:01:33.119> to<00:01:33.180> be<00:01:33.240> rotating<00:01:33.720> about<00:01:33.840> the
