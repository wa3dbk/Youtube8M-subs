techniques<00:01:56.100> it'll<00:01:56.880> show<00:01:57.060> up<00:01:57.149> a<00:01:57.240> little<00:01:57.390> more

00:01:57.590 --> 00:01:57.600 
techniques it'll show up a little more

00:01:57.600 --> 00:01:59.600 
techniques it'll show up a little more
but<00:01:57.869> you<00:01:57.990> can<00:01:58.140> see<00:01:58.350> how<00:01:58.560> that<00:01:59.219> will<00:01:59.340> give<00:01:59.490> you

00:01:59.600 --> 00:01:59.610 
but you can see how that will give you

00:01:59.610 --> 00:02:01.910 
but you can see how that will give you
kind<00:01:59.820> of<00:01:59.939> a<00:02:00.090> roughed<00:02:00.329> up<00:02:00.570> kind<00:02:00.990> of<00:02:01.079> faded<00:02:01.710> and

00:02:01.910 --> 00:02:01.920 
kind of a roughed up kind of faded and

00:02:01.920 --> 00:02:05.359 
kind of a roughed up kind of faded and
worn<00:02:02.310> in<00:02:03.119> area<00:02:03.689> so<00:02:04.110> that<00:02:04.649> actually<00:02:05.100> is<00:02:05.130> going

00:02:05.359 --> 00:02:05.369 
worn in area so that actually is going

00:02:05.369 --> 00:02:07.819 
worn in area so that actually is going
to<00:02:05.430> create<00:02:05.640> this<00:02:06.600> after<00:02:07.259> it's<00:02:07.380> washed<00:02:07.590> and

00:02:07.819 --> 00:02:07.829 
to create this after it's washed and

00:02:07.829 --> 00:02:10.460 
to create this after it's washed and
dried<00:02:08.009> and<00:02:09.000> this<00:02:09.360> exacto<00:02:09.840> knife<00:02:10.020> technique

00:02:10.460 --> 00:02:10.470 
dried and this exacto knife technique

00:02:10.470 --> 00:02:12.590 
dried and this exacto knife technique
done<00:02:11.160> vertically<00:02:11.700> is<00:02:12.060> going<00:02:12.270> to<00:02:12.330> create

00:02:12.590 --> 00:02:12.600 
done vertically is going to create

00:02:12.600 --> 00:02:14.450 
done vertically is going to create
this<00:02:12.780> if<00:02:13.290> you<00:02:13.470> do<00:02:13.590> it<00:02:13.680> horizontally<00:02:14.310> it's

00:02:14.450 --> 00:02:14.460 
this if you do it horizontally it's

00:02:14.460 --> 00:02:17.030 
this if you do it horizontally it's
gonna<00:02:14.580> create<00:02:14.880> more<00:02:15.150> of<00:02:15.240> a<00:02:15.330> snagged<00:02:16.040> exposing

00:02:17.030 --> 00:02:17.040 
gonna create more of a snagged exposing

00:02:17.040 --> 00:02:18.470 
gonna create more of a snagged exposing
certain<00:02:17.430> threads<00:02:17.790> so<00:02:18.120> you're<00:02:18.270> just<00:02:18.360> gonna

00:02:18.470 --> 00:02:18.480 
certain threads so you're just gonna

00:02:18.480 --> 00:02:21.470 
certain threads so you're just gonna
scrape<00:02:18.870> it<00:02:19.050> across<00:02:19.580> horizontally<00:02:20.580> usually<00:02:21.390> in

00:02:21.470 --> 00:02:21.480 
scrape it across horizontally usually in

00:02:21.480 --> 00:02:23.150 
scrape it across horizontally usually in
one<00:02:21.600> direction<00:02:21.780> helps<00:02:22.350> you<00:02:22.650> can<00:02:22.770> also<00:02:22.920> use

00:02:23.150 --> 00:02:23.160 
one direction helps you can also use

00:02:23.160 --> 00:02:25.430 
one direction helps you can also use
scissors<00:02:23.430> to<00:02:23.790> do<00:02:23.940> this<00:02:24.090> or<00:02:24.360> a<00:02:24.720> pocketknife

00:02:25.430 --> 00:02:25.440 
scissors to do this or a pocketknife

00:02:25.440 --> 00:02:28.580 
scissors to do this or a pocketknife
basically<00:02:26.430> any<00:02:26.580> kind<00:02:26.820> of<00:02:26.910> edge<00:02:27.090> but<00:02:28.050> it'll

00:02:28.580 --> 00:02:28.590 
basically any kind of edge but it'll

00:02:28.590 --> 00:02:32.210 
basically any kind of edge but it'll
start<00:02:28.950> exposing<00:02:29.750> some<00:02:30.750> certain<00:02:31.380> threads<00:02:31.680> and

00:02:32.210 --> 00:02:32.220 
start exposing some certain threads and

00:02:32.220 --> 00:02:35.060 
start exposing some certain threads and
basically<00:02:32.880> achieve<00:02:33.390> there<00:02:34.170> you<00:02:34.260> go<00:02:34.440> after<00:02:35.040> a

00:02:35.060 --> 00:02:35.070 
basically achieve there you go after a

00:02:35.070 --> 00:02:39.070 
basically achieve there you go after a
while<00:02:35.250> this<00:02:36.090> type<00:02:36.300> of<00:02:36.330> look<00:02:37.310> with<00:02:38.310> the<00:02:38.640> holes

00:02:39.070 --> 00:02:39.080 
while this type of look with the holes

00:02:39.080 --> 00:02:42.530 
while this type of look with the holes
this<00:02:40.080> is<00:02:40.140> a<00:02:40.290> hole<00:02:40.530> this<00:02:40.980> is<00:02:41.130> a<00:02:41.160> slash<00:02:41.550> it's<00:02:42.330> as

00:02:42.530 --> 00:02:42.540 
this is a hole this is a slash it's as

00:02:42.540 --> 00:02:45.890 
this is a hole this is a slash it's as
simple<00:02:42.690> as<00:02:43.050> basically<00:02:44.240> you<00:02:45.240> can<00:02:45.390> also<00:02:45.510> rip

00:02:45.890 --> 00:02:45.900 
simple as basically you can also rip

00:02:45.900 --> 00:02:48.250 
simple as basically you can also rip
them<00:02:46.110> but<00:02:46.350> it's<00:02:46.650> pretty<00:02:46.860> easy<00:02:47.040> to<00:02:47.310> just<00:02:47.340> cut

00:02:48.250 --> 00:02:48.260 
them but it's pretty easy to just cut

00:02:48.260 --> 00:02:51.800 
them but it's pretty easy to just cut
either<00:02:49.260> a<00:02:49.650> hole<00:02:50.100> so<00:02:51.090> you<00:02:51.150> want<00:02:51.360> to<00:02:51.450> just<00:02:51.570> kind

00:02:51.800 --> 00:02:51.810 
either a hole so you want to just kind

00:02:51.810 --> 00:02:53.900 
either a hole so you want to just kind
of<00:02:51.930> if<00:02:52.140> you<00:02:52.170> want<00:02:52.380> a<00:02:52.470> vertical<00:02:52.890> slash<00:02:53.160> start

00:02:53.900 --> 00:02:53.910 
of if you want a vertical slash start

00:02:53.910 --> 00:02:56.270 
of if you want a vertical slash start
with<00:02:54.030> a<00:02:54.060> small<00:02:54.390> you<00:02:55.290> need<00:02:55.440> to<00:02:55.500> rip<00:02:55.680> it<00:02:55.860> or<00:02:56.040> just

00:02:56.270 --> 00:02:56.280 
with a small you need to rip it or just

00:02:56.280 --> 00:02:59.720 
with a small you need to rip it or just
cut<00:02:56.400> it<00:02:56.490> with<00:02:56.580> the<00:02:56.670> scissors<00:02:57.680> across<00:02:58.730> like

00:02:59.720 --> 00:02:59.730 
cut it with the scissors across like

00:02:59.730 --> 00:03:02.120 
cut it with the scissors across like
that<00:03:00.230> that<00:03:01.230> actually<00:03:01.410> ripped<00:03:01.830> in<00:03:01.980> both

00:03:02.120 --> 00:03:02.130 
that that actually ripped in both

00:03:02.130 --> 00:03:03.920 
that that actually ripped in both
directions<00:03:02.430> so<00:03:02.700> it's<00:03:02.970> easier<00:03:03.540> to<00:03:03.600> have<00:03:03.750> more

00:03:03.920 --> 00:03:03.930 
directions so it's easier to have more

00:03:03.930 --> 00:03:06.380 
directions so it's easier to have more
control<00:03:04.200> with<00:03:04.410> scissors<00:03:04.940> or<00:03:05.940> you<00:03:06.090> can<00:03:06.240> just

00:03:06.380 --> 00:03:06.390 
control with scissors or you can just

00:03:06.390 --> 00:03:08.990 
control with scissors or you can just
mark<00:03:06.570> a<00:03:06.720> hole<00:03:06.930> and<00:03:07.290> cut<00:03:08.040> within<00:03:08.310> the<00:03:08.670> perimeter

00:03:08.990 --> 00:03:09.000 
mark a hole and cut within the perimeter

00:03:09.000 --> 00:03:10.280 
mark a hole and cut within the perimeter
of<00:03:09.060> the<00:03:09.210> hole<00:03:09.360> because<00:03:09.660> when<00:03:09.810> you<00:03:09.900> wash<00:03:10.080> and

00:03:10.280 --> 00:03:10.290 
of the hole because when you wash and

00:03:10.290 --> 00:03:11.990 
of the hole because when you wash and
dry<00:03:10.410> them<00:03:10.590> it's<00:03:11.010> going<00:03:11.160> to<00:03:11.220> fray<00:03:11.520> out<00:03:11.700> a<00:03:11.730> little

00:03:11.990 --> 00:03:12.000 
dry them it's going to fray out a little

00:03:12.000 --> 00:03:13.610 
dry them it's going to fray out a little
bit<00:03:12.240> and<00:03:12.420> if<00:03:12.720> you<00:03:12.750> want<00:03:13.020> the<00:03:13.140> hole<00:03:13.260> this<00:03:13.410> size

00:03:13.610 --> 00:03:13.620 
bit and if you want the hole this size

00:03:13.620 --> 00:03:15.800 
bit and if you want the hole this size
you<00:03:14.310> want<00:03:14.490> to<00:03:14.580> keep<00:03:14.970> within<00:03:15.210> the<00:03:15.420> perimeter<00:03:15.780> of

00:03:15.800 --> 00:03:15.810 
you want to keep within the perimeter of

00:03:15.810 --> 00:03:20.060 
you want to keep within the perimeter of
that<00:03:15.900> and<00:03:17.900> any<00:03:18.900> kind<00:03:19.170> of<00:03:19.260> alteration<00:03:19.830> you<00:03:19.920> want

and basically apply a bead of bleach
along<00:03:54.810> that<00:03:55.050> line<00:03:55.260> and<00:03:58.730> then<00:03:59.730> if<00:03:59.910> you<00:04:00.030> have

00:04:00.170 --> 00:04:00.180 
along that line and then if you have

along that line and then if you have
your<00:04:00.330> whisker<00:04:00.690> effect<00:04:01.130> you<00:04:02.130> marked<00:04:02.400> it<00:04:02.490> with

00:04:02.510 --> 00:04:02.520 
your whisker effect you marked it with

00:04:02.520 --> 00:04:06.230 
your whisker effect you marked it with
the<00:04:02.730> chalk<00:04:02.970> here<00:04:03.510> basically<00:04:03.800> going<00:04:04.800> to<00:04:05.210> top<00:04:06.210> it

00:04:06.230 --> 00:04:06.240 
the chalk here basically going to top it

00:04:06.240 --> 00:04:08.570 
the chalk here basically going to top it
over<00:04:06.750> the<00:04:06.870> chalk<00:04:07.110> lines<00:04:07.410> with<00:04:07.980> the<00:04:08.100> bleach<00:04:08.310> pen

00:04:08.570 --> 00:04:08.580 
over the chalk lines with the bleach pen

00:04:08.580 --> 00:04:10.430 
over the chalk lines with the bleach pen
and<00:04:08.820> you<00:04:09.600> can<00:04:09.630> make<00:04:09.960> them<00:04:10.140> a<00:04:10.170> little<00:04:10.320> more

00:04:10.430 --> 00:04:10.440 
and you can make them a little more

00:04:10.440 --> 00:04:12.920 
and you can make them a little more
subtle<00:04:10.980> or<00:04:11.190> faded<00:04:11.730> or<00:04:11.940> precise<00:04:12.390> it<00:04:12.690> kind<00:04:12.870> of

00:04:12.920 --> 00:04:12.930 
subtle or faded or precise it kind of

00:04:12.930 --> 00:04:15.170 
subtle or faded or precise it kind of
depends<00:04:13.800> but<00:04:14.220> you<00:04:14.340> basically<00:04:14.460> use<00:04:14.850> it<00:04:15.030> just

00:04:15.170 --> 00:04:15.180 
depends but you basically use it just

00:04:15.180 --> 00:04:18.410 
depends but you basically use it just
like<00:04:15.300> a<00:04:15.420> pen<00:04:15.720> and<00:04:16.489> most<00:04:17.489> bleach<00:04:17.760> pens<00:04:18.000> do<00:04:18.210> need

00:04:18.410 --> 00:04:18.420 
like a pen and most bleach pens do need

00:04:18.420 --> 00:04:20.510 
like a pen and most bleach pens do need
to<00:04:18.540> be<00:04:18.660> activated<00:04:19.260> with<00:04:19.470> some<00:04:19.770> hot<00:04:19.950> water<00:04:20.130> so

00:04:20.510 --> 00:04:20.520 
to be activated with some hot water so

00:04:20.520 --> 00:04:22.250 
to be activated with some hot water so
you<00:04:20.580> can<00:04:20.790> either<00:04:20.910> do<00:04:21.660> this<00:04:21.840> through<00:04:22.140> them

00:04:22.250 --> 00:04:22.260 
you can either do this through them

00:04:22.260 --> 00:04:23.750 
you can either do this through them
right<00:04:22.410> in<00:04:22.500> the<00:04:22.560> washing<00:04:22.710> machine<00:04:22.890> or<00:04:23.370> spray<00:04:23.729> it

00:04:23.750 --> 00:04:23.760 
right in the washing machine or spray it

00:04:23.760 --> 00:04:24.800 
right in the washing machine or spray it
with<00:04:23.970> some<00:04:24.180> warm<00:04:24.330> water<00:04:24.419> be

00:04:24.800 --> 00:04:24.810 
with some warm water be

00:04:24.810 --> 00:04:26.690 
with some warm water be
or<00:04:24.900> you<00:04:24.990> actually<00:04:25.320> do<00:04:25.440> the<00:04:25.560> effect<00:04:25.889> but

00:04:26.690 --> 00:04:26.700 
or you actually do the effect but

00:04:26.700 --> 00:04:27.860 
or you actually do the effect but
hopefully<00:04:27.000> it<00:04:27.090> won't<00:04:27.240> cover<00:04:27.360> up<00:04:27.540> the<00:04:27.690> chalk

00:04:27.860 --> 00:04:27.870 
hopefully it won't cover up the chalk

00:04:27.870 --> 00:04:30.050 
hopefully it won't cover up the chalk
marks<00:04:28.139> so<00:04:28.770> those<00:04:29.130> are<00:04:29.280> the<00:04:29.370> techniques<00:04:29.730> that

00:04:30.050 --> 00:04:30.060 
marks so those are the techniques that

00:04:30.060 --> 00:04:34.310 
marks so those are the techniques that
you<00:04:30.480> can<00:04:30.690> use<00:04:30.750> to<00:04:31.350> customize<00:04:31.590> your<00:04:32.070> jeans
