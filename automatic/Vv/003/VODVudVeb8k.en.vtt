batteries<00:01:21.299> so<00:01:22.229> if<00:01:22.350> I<00:01:22.439> took<00:01:22.500> out<00:01:22.860> the<00:01:23.040> battery

00:01:23.420 --> 00:01:23.430 
batteries so if I took out the battery

00:01:23.430 --> 00:01:25.670 
batteries so if I took out the battery
then<00:01:23.970> you'd<00:01:24.240> actually<00:01:24.450> be<00:01:24.720> able<00:01:24.990> to<00:01:25.170> hook<00:01:25.500> this

00:01:25.670 --> 00:01:25.680 
then you'd actually be able to hook this

00:01:25.680 --> 00:01:27.499 
then you'd actually be able to hook this
yes<00:01:25.979> and<00:01:26.009> if<00:01:26.430> we<00:01:26.549> look<00:01:26.759> at<00:01:26.909> just<00:01:27.150> the<00:01:27.270> size

00:01:27.499 --> 00:01:27.509 
yes and if we look at just the size

00:01:27.509 --> 00:01:30.109 
yes and if we look at just the size
comparison<00:01:27.990> it's<00:01:28.770> so<00:01:29.100> small<00:01:29.460> and<00:01:29.520> I<00:01:29.909> was<00:01:30.000> able

00:01:30.109 --> 00:01:30.119 
comparison it's so small and I was able

00:01:30.119 --> 00:01:33.230 
comparison it's so small and I was able
to<00:01:30.299> actually<00:01:30.659> put<00:01:31.020> this<00:01:31.200> with<00:01:31.880> replaces<00:01:32.880> with

00:01:33.230 --> 00:01:33.240 
to actually put this with replaces with

00:01:33.240 --> 00:01:35.569 
to actually put this with replaces with
the<00:01:33.299> normal<00:01:33.570> battery<00:01:33.720> with<00:01:34.590> her<00:01:34.740> $50,000
