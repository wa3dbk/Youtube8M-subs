00:01:57.110 --> 00:01:58.899 
mean I'm just not I mean it's only seven
dollars<00:01:57.530> so<00:01:57.830> if<00:01:58.100> you<00:01:58.220> give<00:01:58.370> something<00:01:58.670> I<00:01:58.850> think

00:01:58.899 --> 00:01:58.909 
dollars so if you give something I think

00:01:58.909 --> 00:02:00.580 
dollars so if you give something I think
you<00:01:59.150> can<00:01:59.330> mix<00:01:59.479> it<00:01:59.659> with<00:01:59.780> something<00:01:59.990> and<00:02:00.440> it

00:02:00.580 --> 00:02:00.590 
you can mix it with something and it

00:02:00.590 --> 00:02:02.200 
you can mix it with something and it
will<00:02:00.710> work<00:02:00.890> better<00:02:01.159> i<00:02:01.460> think<00:02:01.970> i'm<00:02:02.030> going<00:02:02.150> to

00:02:02.200 --> 00:02:02.210 
will work better i think i'm going to

00:02:02.210 --> 00:02:04.060 
will work better i think i'm going to
mix<00:02:02.390> it<00:02:02.540> with<00:02:02.570> eco<00:02:02.990> styler<00:02:03.200> because<00:02:03.710> eco

00:02:04.060 --> 00:02:04.070 
mix it with eco styler because eco

00:02:04.070 --> 00:02:06.880 
mix it with eco styler because eco
scholars<00:02:04.490> too<00:02:04.670> thick<00:02:04.940> for<00:02:05.180> me<00:02:05.210> so<00:02:05.900> i<00:02:05.930> think<00:02:06.140> if

00:02:06.880 --> 00:02:06.890 
scholars too thick for me so i think if

00:02:06.890 --> 00:02:08.990 
scholars too thick for me so i think if
i<00:02:07.070> get<00:02:07.490> so<00:02:07.640> many<00:02:07.760> too<00:02:07.940> thin<00:02:08.149> and<00:02:08.179> something<00:02:08.629> too

00:02:08.990 --> 00:02:09.000 
i get so many too thin and something too

00:02:09.000 --> 00:02:12.020
