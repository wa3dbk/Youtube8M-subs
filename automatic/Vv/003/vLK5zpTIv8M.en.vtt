out there it has a nice feel to it let's

00:03:30.600 --> 00:03:40.410 
out there it has a nice feel to it let's
just<00:03:30.750> get<00:03:30.900> this<00:03:32.450> piece<00:03:33.450> of<00:03:33.569> paper<00:03:33.660> out<00:03:33.840> of<00:03:34.019> here

00:03:40.410 --> 00:03:40.420 

00:03:40.420 --> 00:03:44.100 

say<00:03:41.420> it<00:03:41.510> just<00:03:41.660> slides<00:03:41.960> off<00:03:42.200> like<00:03:42.380> that<00:03:42.530> and<00:03:42.830> I

00:03:44.100 --> 00:03:44.110 
say it just slides off like that and I

00:03:44.110 --> 00:03:46.150 
say it just slides off like that and I
don't<00:03:45.110> know<00:03:45.170> if<00:03:45.260> you<00:03:45.350> can<00:03:45.500> see<00:03:45.800> from<00:03:45.950> this

00:03:46.150 --> 00:03:46.160 
don't know if you can see from this

00:03:46.160 --> 00:03:54.640 
don't know if you can see from this
angle<00:03:47.740> but<00:03:48.740> there<00:03:48.950> are<00:03:49.100> these<00:03:50.680> rubber<00:03:53.650> but

00:03:54.640 --> 00:03:54.650 
angle but there are these rubber but

00:03:54.650 --> 00:03:58.480 
angle but there are these rubber but
we're<00:03:54.770> like<00:03:55.150> bumpers<00:03:56.150> almost<00:03:56.840> on<00:03:57.650> the<00:03:58.130> bottom

00:03:58.480 --> 00:03:58.490 
we're like bumpers almost on the bottom

00:03:58.490 --> 00:04:02.650 
we're like bumpers almost on the bottom
here<00:03:58.700> and<00:04:00.160> I<00:04:01.160> guess<00:04:01.700> those<00:04:01.880> are<00:04:01.910> to<00:04:02.300> keep<00:04:02.540> the

00:04:02.650 --> 00:04:02.660 
here and I guess those are to keep the

00:04:02.660 --> 00:04:05.380 
here and I guess those are to keep the
iphone<00:04:03.050> stable<00:04:03.920> and<00:04:04.130> also<00:04:04.580> for<00:04:04.850> some<00:04:05.120> shock

00:04:05.380 --> 00:04:05.390 
iphone stable and also for some shock

00:04:05.390 --> 00:04:13.740 
iphone stable and also for some shock
resistance<00:04:06.080> if<00:04:06.770> dropped<00:04:07.570> so<00:04:10.360> they<00:04:11.360> go<00:04:11.480> to<00:04:11.660> this

00:04:13.740 --> 00:04:13.750 
resistance if dropped so they go to this

00:04:13.750 --> 00:04:17.310 
resistance if dropped so they go to this
and<00:04:14.750> these<00:04:14.840> are<00:04:14.990> the<00:04:15.080> same<00:04:15.260> thing<00:04:15.530> right<00:04:15.950> here

00:04:17.310 --> 00:04:17.320 
and these are the same thing right here

00:04:17.320 --> 00:04:24.220 
and these are the same thing right here
so<00:04:18.320> you<00:04:18.380> just<00:04:18.770> slide<00:04:19.070> the<00:04:19.280> phone<00:04:19.489> in<00:04:23.080> close<00:04:24.080> it

00:04:24.220 --> 00:04:24.230 
so you just slide the phone in close it

00:04:24.230 --> 00:04:29.770 
so you just slide the phone in close it
up<00:04:24.350> like<00:04:24.500> that<00:04:24.530> and<00:04:25.930> you<00:04:26.930> good<00:04:27.110> to<00:04:27.200> go<00:04:27.350> I<00:04:28.780> was

00:04:29.770 --> 00:04:29.780

00:04:32.960 --> 00:04:36.270 
one thing i saw on one of the youtube
