00:00:10.089 --> 00:00:15.070
 gtc of childhood I imagine life without tickets without friends to play at 

00:00:15.070 --> 00:00:20.400
 hide-and-seek without mother with whom the leader your only desire is to have a 

00:00:20.399 --> 00:00:25.849
 stable family although toner has eventually become external dream 

00:00:25.849 --> 00:00:27.960
 it had barely been 

00:00:27.960 --> 00:00:33.210
 It was played every chaves that life is not easy that loneliness seems to kill and 

00:00:33.210 --> 00:00:36.210
 soon you get comfort when you sleep 

00:00:36.780 --> 00:00:39.339
 the effort and positive milk 

00:00:39.339 --> 00:00:43.059
 but as you do not understand to see who knows and then 

00:00:44.400 --> 00:00:47.360
 this is the story of hundreds of abandoned children 

00:00:47.360 --> 00:00:52.290
 whose mothers were or are victims of drug addiction and abuse almost all 

00:00:52.290 --> 00:00:54.050
 going through the place 

00:00:54.050 --> 00:00:56.810
 it seems that dialogue small injury I eat 

00:00:56.810 --> 00:01:00.740
 motivated to light these children and yesterday the saw while keys to improve 

00:01:00.740 --> 00:01:02.770
 their lifestyles 

00:01:02.770 --> 00:01:06.920
 during the first few days at home street taking care of the clubs that the best 

00:01:06.920 --> 00:01:09.770
 way to help them and I found it 

00:01:09.770 --> 00:01:12.219
 because of those difficult life situations 

00:01:12.219 --> 00:01:15.650
 had not been able to develop in the field of the parties 

00:01:15.650 --> 00:01:17.100
 for such purposes 

00:01:17.100 --> 00:01:18.500
 I commented on the music 

00:01:18.500 --> 00:01:22.560
 teaching them to vary the sound of their own children's lyrics and songs 

00:01:24.630 --> 00:01:28.960
 I also used painting and drawing as educational means to develop 

00:01:28.960 --> 00:01:30.930
 your motivational skills 

00:01:30.930 --> 00:01:32.860
 and counteract shyness 

00:01:32.860 --> 00:01:36.120
 that in many cases the clothes 

00:01:36.120 --> 00:01:40.800
 with the culture policy on the other side I showed the children the importance of 

00:01:40.800 --> 00:01:42.690
 take care of the environment 

00:01:42.690 --> 00:01:46.530
 with the fingerprints of his hands we did with moral in the form of a tree 

00:01:46.530 --> 00:01:50.910
 remind children that over time they have been forced to leave the 

00:01:50.910 --> 00:01:53.650
 home for his age 

00:01:53.650 --> 00:01:58.310
 but my effort does not seem enough because it is about children who do not usually 

00:01:58.310 --> 00:02:01.409
 receive visits my visit would be different 

00:02:02.390 --> 00:02:05.950
 inspired by their experiences and experiences in the face of the terrible disease 

00:02:05.950 --> 00:02:07.250
 of AIDS 

00:02:07.250 --> 00:02:11.730
 I wrote a children's book to help them fight adversity 

00:02:11.730 --> 00:02:12.869
 that his illness 

00:02:12.869 --> 00:02:15.869
 and motivate them to keep fighting to achieve their goals 

00:02:17.269 --> 00:02:21.019
 so I will continue working with the children of the small home and that 

00:02:21.019 --> 00:02:24.849
 who taught me that there is no disease or would be able to overshadow 

00:02:24.849 --> 00:02:27.249
 the happiness of being alive 

00:02:27.249 --> 00:02:28.510
 but above all 

00:02:28.510 --> 00:02:31.359
 they showed me with oak signs 

00:02:31.359 --> 00:02:34.359
 that true faith is in the heart 

00:02:41.729 --> 00:02:44.729
 to 

00:02:45.459 --> 00:02:45.979
 my lady
