now<00:00:00.930> in<00:00:01.079> this<00:00:01.230> video<00:00:01.500> I'll<00:00:01.890> be<00:00:01.949> explaining<00:00:02.550> the

00:00:02.720 --> 00:00:02.730 
now in this video I'll be explaining the

00:00:02.730 --> 00:00:04.730 
now in this video I'll be explaining the
purpose<00:00:03.240> of<00:00:03.389> a<00:00:03.480> turbo<00:00:03.899> and<00:00:04.110> how<00:00:04.410> it<00:00:04.560> creates

00:00:04.730 --> 00:00:04.740 
purpose of a turbo and how it creates

00:00:04.740 --> 00:00:07.280 
purpose of a turbo and how it creates
more<00:00:05.279> power<00:00:05.520> now<00:00:06.390> if<00:00:06.540> you're<00:00:06.660> interested<00:00:07.200> in

00:00:07.280 --> 00:00:07.290 
more power now if you're interested in

00:00:07.290 --> 00:00:08.810 
more power now if you're interested in
the<00:00:07.379> actual<00:00:07.529> components<00:00:08.429> of<00:00:08.580> the

00:00:08.810 --> 00:00:08.820 
the actual components of the

00:00:08.820 --> 00:00:10.910 
the actual components of the
turbocharger<00:00:09.210> I'll<00:00:09.990> have<00:00:10.320> an<00:00:10.440> additional

00:00:10.910 --> 00:00:10.920 
turbocharger I'll have an additional

00:00:10.920 --> 00:00:13.009 
turbocharger I'll have an additional
video<00:00:11.219> which<00:00:11.460> will<00:00:11.580> explain<00:00:11.969> that<00:00:12.030> but<00:00:12.840> this

00:00:13.009 --> 00:00:13.019 
video which will explain that but this

00:00:13.019 --> 00:00:14.360 
video which will explain that but this
is<00:00:13.230> just<00:00:13.349> going<00:00:13.440> to<00:00:13.590> give<00:00:13.740> you<00:00:13.830> the<00:00:13.950> basic

00:00:14.360 --> 00:00:14.370 
is just going to give you the basic

00:00:14.370 --> 00:00:16.730 
is just going to give you the basic
understanding<00:00:15.120> of<00:00:15.299> how<00:00:15.870> a<00:00:15.900> turbocharger

00:00:16.730 --> 00:00:16.740 
understanding of how a turbocharger

00:00:16.740 --> 00:00:18.740 
understanding of how a turbocharger
actually<00:00:17.369> creates<00:00:17.699> more<00:00:17.940> power<00:00:18.150> and<00:00:18.449> what<00:00:18.630> it

00:00:18.740 --> 00:00:18.750 
actually creates more power and what it

00:00:18.750 --> 00:00:22.250 
actually creates more power and what it
actually<00:00:18.930> does<00:00:19.730> so<00:00:20.730> what<00:00:21.300> you<00:00:21.810> used<00:00:22.109> a

00:00:22.250 --> 00:00:22.260 
actually does so what you used a

00:00:22.260 --> 00:00:25.130 
actually does so what you used a
turbocharger<00:00:23.039> for<00:00:23.369> is<00:00:23.699> you<00:00:24.359> use<00:00:24.539> the<00:00:24.750> exhaust

00:00:25.130 --> 00:00:25.140 
turbocharger for is you use the exhaust

00:00:25.140 --> 00:00:28.189 
turbocharger for is you use the exhaust
gas<00:00:25.560> from<00:00:26.070> your<00:00:26.220> engine<00:00:26.400> to<00:00:27.269> spin<00:00:27.599> a<00:00:27.630> turbine

00:00:28.189 --> 00:00:28.199 
gas from your engine to spin a turbine

00:00:28.199 --> 00:00:31.279 
gas from your engine to spin a turbine
which<00:00:29.130> will<00:00:29.369> then<00:00:29.580> suck<00:00:30.060> in<00:00:30.269> air<00:00:30.539> from<00:00:30.810> outside

00:00:31.279 --> 00:00:31.289 
which will then suck in air from outside

00:00:31.289 --> 00:00:34.580 
which will then suck in air from outside
and<00:00:31.619> force<00:00:32.040> this<00:00:32.309> air<00:00:32.640> into<00:00:33.300> your<00:00:33.590> ignition

00:00:34.580 --> 00:00:34.590 
and force this air into your ignition

00:00:34.590 --> 00:00:38.660 
and force this air into your ignition
chamber<00:00:35.219> into<00:00:35.460> your<00:00:36.120> cylinders<00:00:37.040> so<00:00:38.040> by

00:00:38.660 --> 00:00:38.670 
chamber into your cylinders so by

00:00:38.670 --> 00:00:41.119 
chamber into your cylinders so by
forcing<00:00:39.270> an<00:00:39.390> additional<00:00:39.960> air<00:00:40.200> which<00:00:40.920> is

00:00:41.119 --> 00:00:41.129 
forcing an additional air which is

00:00:41.129 --> 00:00:43.190 
forcing an additional air which is
called<00:00:41.370> boost<00:00:41.700> and<00:00:42.149> you'll<00:00:42.360> have<00:00:42.540> this<00:00:42.690> rated

00:00:43.190 --> 00:00:43.200 
called boost and you'll have this rated

00:00:43.200 --> 00:00:46.910 
called boost and you'll have this rated
on<00:00:43.610> many<00:00:44.610> cars<00:00:44.940> will<00:00:45.120> have<00:00:45.270> 8<00:00:45.539> to<00:00:45.780> 10<00:00:46.020> psi<00:00:46.350> boost

00:00:46.910 --> 00:00:46.920 
on many cars will have 8 to 10 psi boost

00:00:46.920 --> 00:00:51.010 
on many cars will have 8 to 10 psi boost
nicer<00:00:47.670> cars<00:00:47.969> can<00:00:48.300> handle<00:00:48.860> 1415<00:00:49.860> psi<00:00:50.430> of<00:00:50.579> boost

00:00:51.010 --> 00:00:51.020 
nicer cars can handle 1415 psi of boost

00:00:51.020 --> 00:00:55.630 
nicer cars can handle 1415 psi of boost
and<00:00:52.020> and<00:00:52.440> greater<00:00:52.860> for<00:00:53.340> even<00:00:53.850> more

00:00:55.630 --> 00:00:55.640 
and and greater for even more

00:00:55.640 --> 00:00:59.510 
and and greater for even more
well-constructed<00:00:56.640> vehicles<00:00:57.620> now<00:00:58.620> what

00:00:59.510 --> 00:00:59.520 
well-constructed vehicles now what

00:00:59.520 --> 00:01:02.150 
well-constructed vehicles now what
happens<00:00:59.940> is<00:01:00.180> you're<00:01:00.629> forcing<00:01:01.109> in<00:01:01.440> additional

00:01:02.150 --> 00:01:02.160 
happens is you're forcing in additional

00:01:02.160 --> 00:01:06.170 
happens is you're forcing in additional
air<00:01:02.460> into<00:01:03.329> the<00:01:04.220> cylinders<00:01:05.220> so<00:01:05.880> you're<00:01:06.060> going

00:01:06.170 --> 00:01:06.180 
air into the cylinders so you're going

00:01:06.180 --> 00:01:09.380 
air into the cylinders so you're going
to<00:01:06.210> have<00:01:06.420> more<00:01:06.720> air<00:01:06.930> in<00:01:07.200> here<00:01:07.700> more<00:01:08.700> oxygen

00:01:09.380 --> 00:01:09.390 
to have more air in here more oxygen

00:01:09.390 --> 00:01:11.450 
to have more air in here more oxygen
that's<00:01:09.659> the<00:01:09.990> important<00:01:10.470> part<00:01:10.650> with<00:01:11.220> more

00:01:11.450 --> 00:01:11.460 
that's the important part with more

00:01:11.460 --> 00:01:15.980 
that's the important part with more
oxygen<00:01:11.670> you<00:01:12.299> can<00:01:12.720> burn<00:01:12.900> more<00:01:13.140> fuel<00:01:13.520> so<00:01:14.990> you're

00:01:15.980 --> 00:01:15.990 
oxygen you can burn more fuel so you're

00:01:15.990 --> 00:01:17.870 
oxygen you can burn more fuel so you're
going<00:01:16.170> to<00:01:16.229> have<00:01:16.380> a<00:01:16.560> greater<00:01:16.920> amount<00:01:17.250> of<00:01:17.580> fuel

00:01:17.870 --> 00:01:17.880 
going to have a greater amount of fuel

00:01:17.880 --> 00:01:21.289 
going to have a greater amount of fuel
say<00:01:18.390> 15<00:01:19.200> psi<00:01:19.710> now<00:01:19.950> atmospheric<00:01:20.729> pressure<00:01:21.030> is

00:01:21.289 --> 00:01:21.299 
say 15 psi now atmospheric pressure is

00:01:21.299 --> 00:01:23.810 
say 15 psi now atmospheric pressure is
about<00:01:21.509> fourteen<00:01:22.080> point<00:01:22.350> seven<00:01:22.530> psi<00:01:22.950> so<00:01:23.670> if

00:01:23.810 --> 00:01:23.820 
about fourteen point seven psi so if

00:01:23.820 --> 00:01:27.830 
about fourteen point seven psi so if
you've<00:01:23.970> got<00:01:24.210> 15<00:01:24.900> psi<00:01:26.119> you've<00:01:27.119> doubled<00:01:27.720> the

00:01:27.830 --> 00:01:27.840 
you've got 15 psi you've doubled the

00:01:27.840 --> 00:01:29.630 
you've got 15 psi you've doubled the
pressure<00:01:28.110> so<00:01:28.530> you<00:01:28.619> can<00:01:28.770> have<00:01:28.950> twice<00:01:29.250> as<00:01:29.460> much

00:01:29.630 --> 00:01:29.640 
pressure so you can have twice as much

00:01:29.640 --> 00:01:32.420 
pressure so you can have twice as much
oxygen<00:01:29.939> in<00:01:30.479> there<00:01:30.659> now<00:01:31.290> with<00:01:31.439> all<00:01:31.590> this<00:01:31.770> oxygen

00:01:32.420 --> 00:01:32.430 
oxygen in there now with all this oxygen

00:01:32.430 --> 00:01:34.219 
oxygen in there now with all this oxygen
you're<00:01:32.670> going<00:01:32.790> to<00:01:32.850> use<00:01:33.000> more<00:01:33.210> fuel<00:01:33.869> and<00:01:34.110> you're

00:01:34.219 --> 00:01:34.229 
you're going to use more fuel and you're

00:01:34.229 --> 00:01:36.020 
you're going to use more fuel and you're
going<00:01:34.380> to<00:01:34.439> create<00:01:34.619> a<00:01:34.770> bigger<00:01:35.040> explosion<00:01:35.460> in

00:01:36.020 --> 00:01:36.030 
going to create a bigger explosion in

00:01:36.030 --> 00:01:39.800 
going to create a bigger explosion in
your<00:01:36.689> cylinder<00:01:37.290> so<00:01:37.890> a<00:01:38.189> bigger<00:01:38.790> explosion<00:01:39.390> in

00:01:39.800 --> 00:01:39.810 
your cylinder so a bigger explosion in

00:01:39.810 --> 00:01:43.039 
your cylinder so a bigger explosion in
your<00:01:39.960> cylinder<00:01:40.439> means<00:01:40.860> that<00:01:41.520> this<00:01:42.090> piston

00:01:43.039 --> 00:01:43.049 
your cylinder means that this piston

00:01:43.049 --> 00:01:44.359 
your cylinder means that this piston
right<00:01:43.229> here<00:01:43.439> which<00:01:43.590> is<00:01:43.710> connected<00:01:43.890> to<00:01:44.189> your

00:01:44.359 --> 00:01:44.369 
right here which is connected to your

00:01:44.369 --> 00:01:46.130 
right here which is connected to your
crankshaft<00:01:44.640> is<00:01:45.030> going<00:01:45.450> to<00:01:45.509> be<00:01:45.570> forced<00:01:45.869> down

00:01:46.130 --> 00:01:46.140 
crankshaft is going to be forced down

00:01:46.140 --> 00:01:48.319 
crankshaft is going to be forced down
with<00:01:46.380> a<00:01:46.409> greater<00:01:46.649> force<00:01:46.979> if<00:01:47.579> there's<00:01:47.909> a<00:01:47.970> larger

00:01:48.319 --> 00:01:48.329 
with a greater force if there's a larger

00:01:48.329 --> 00:01:50.539 
with a greater force if there's a larger
explosion<00:01:48.600> so<00:01:49.530> you<00:01:49.590> get<00:01:49.829> a<00:01:49.860> larger<00:01:50.250> force

00:01:50.539 --> 00:01:50.549 
explosion so you get a larger force

00:01:50.549 --> 00:01:52.969 
explosion so you get a larger force
forcing<00:01:51.329> this<00:01:51.509> crankshaft<00:01:52.079> to<00:01:52.229> turn<00:01:52.470> this

inside<00:02:10.580> of<00:02:10.970> the<00:02:11.690> cylinder<00:02:12.400> you're<00:02:13.400> going<00:02:13.550> to

00:02:13.600 --> 00:02:13.610 
inside of the cylinder you're going to

00:02:13.610 --> 00:02:15.820 
inside of the cylinder you're going to
give<00:02:13.940> a<00:02:13.970> greater<00:02:14.330> force<00:02:14.629> on<00:02:14.959> this<00:02:15.110> tire<00:02:15.440> to

rotate and that is a basic principle of

00:02:18.379 --> 00:02:21.130 
rotate and that is a basic principle of
a<00:02:18.530> turbo<00:02:18.920> and<00:02:19.159> what<00:02:19.970> it<00:02:20.120> is<00:02:20.239> attempting<00:02:20.959> to
