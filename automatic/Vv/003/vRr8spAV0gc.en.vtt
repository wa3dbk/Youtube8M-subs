00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.410
 hello this video for fans 

00:00:01.469 --> 00:00:08.460
 Turkish cuisine today we will do with you 

00:00:04.410 --> 00:00:09.630
 Express recipe does not happen more quickly 

00:00:08.460 --> 00:00:12.480
 like of the sea 

00:00:09.630 --> 00:00:14.460
 this turkish chicken cutlets that us 

00:00:12.480 --> 00:00:16.230
 need we warm up here two 

00:00:14.460 --> 00:00:17.250
 tablespoons of margarine in my case 

00:00:16.230 --> 00:00:21.029
 butter 

00:00:17.250 --> 00:00:23.010
 three quarters cup of milk a little bit 

00:00:21.029 --> 00:00:26.099
 shabby cheese take away even a bit too much for us 

00:00:23.010 --> 00:00:28.470
 Normally 2 yolks itself boil chicken 

00:00:26.099 --> 00:00:32.099
 finely chopped chicken fillet in my 

00:00:28.470 --> 00:00:36.030
 case it was chicken legs so to speak 

00:00:32.099 --> 00:00:38.820
 and chicken thighs out of broth I'm here 

00:00:36.030 --> 00:00:40.980
 cook soup chicken and here we have flour 

00:00:38.820 --> 00:00:46.370
 three tablespoons will be needed in 

00:00:40.980 --> 00:00:54.210
 the saucepan, we melted butter take flour 

00:00:46.370 --> 00:00:59.190
 three tablespoons 0 to 2 with a slide we 

00:00:54.210 --> 00:01:01.620
 make the sauce with you stir not to 

00:00:59.190 --> 00:01:06.619
 it was lumps doing much quieter on 

00:01:01.620 --> 00:01:09.180
 foursome won't stir the flour 

00:01:06.619 --> 00:01:13.080
 we have so little dough 

00:01:09.180 --> 00:01:15.720
 it turns out to say something right 

00:01:13.080 --> 00:01:20.520
 started the whole thing little by little 

00:01:15.720 --> 00:01:23.250
 add milk by giving opportunity 

00:01:20.520 --> 00:01:25.080
 he doesnâ€™t stop steaming 

00:01:23.250 --> 00:01:27.840
 stir to avoid lumps 

00:01:25.080 --> 00:01:31.970
 all this went our way according to her feelings 

00:01:27.840 --> 00:01:31.970
 only uniform sauce is good 

00:01:32.780 --> 00:01:38.430
 mix the whole essentially long what 

00:01:36.750 --> 00:01:39.030
 here by prescription it is just to create 

00:01:38.430 --> 00:01:43.200
 chicken 

00:01:39.030 --> 00:01:46.159
 pre cut it but it took me 

00:01:43.200 --> 00:01:49.470
 half an hour while waiting until boil and 

00:01:46.159 --> 00:01:52.350
 the pros are strong but I didn't cool it 

00:01:49.470 --> 00:01:58.590
 And so we add more milk remaining 

00:01:52.350 --> 00:01:59.600
 Oops chicken broth can be immediately soup 

00:01:58.590 --> 00:02:03.619
 cook 

00:01:59.600 --> 00:02:06.210
 to be comfortable in two 

00:02:03.619 --> 00:02:10.250
 now we can get our can 

00:02:06.210 --> 00:02:14.060
 Milk general prescription I will say right away 

00:02:10.250 --> 00:02:16.820
 here this sauce then we mix with 

00:02:14.060 --> 00:02:19.220
 chicken and put in the fridge for 2-3 

00:02:16.820 --> 00:02:22.010
 hours of parity so that this whole thing is cooled and 

00:02:19.220 --> 00:02:24.140
 they like to say the ingredients stuck together 

00:02:22.010 --> 00:02:25.490
 that is, it turned out such a mass with which 

00:02:24.140 --> 00:02:28.010
 we can make cutlets 

00:02:25.490 --> 00:02:30.350
 i don't have much time i just 

00:02:28.010 --> 00:02:33.530
 the whole thing is mixed up already there like a spoon 

00:02:30.350 --> 00:02:34.480
 Essences pancakes I'll lay out on the pan 

00:02:33.530 --> 00:02:37.700
 I will fry 

00:02:34.480 --> 00:02:41.090
 for roasting, we also need an egg 

00:02:37.700 --> 00:02:43.810
 flour and breadcrumbs needed 

00:02:41.090 --> 00:02:43.810
 standard set 

00:02:44.170 --> 00:02:50.810
 we almost sold the sauce using 

00:02:47.450 --> 00:02:59.480
 almost always the main thing 

00:02:50.810 --> 00:03:01.550
 stir it add like cheese long ago 

00:02:59.480 --> 00:03:08.420
 Our as always by not flew 

00:03:01.550 --> 00:03:10.310
 here's dad mix the main thing too 

00:03:08.420 --> 00:03:12.280
 so that there are no lumps like she is scary 

00:03:10.310 --> 00:03:14.720
 program in whom as I do not observe 

00:03:12.280 --> 00:03:17.750
 ok they sort of have but they 

00:03:14.720 --> 00:03:22.280
 disperse with time huge huge 

00:03:17.750 --> 00:03:23.959
 problems deal in general 5 minutes and and me 

00:03:22.280 --> 00:03:25.610
 trailer really like the fact that you can 

00:03:23.959 --> 00:03:28.459
 Russia is very easy to cook 

00:03:25.610 --> 00:03:29.890
 nothing special spices either products 

00:03:28.459 --> 00:03:36.350
 those who are not in Russia 

00:03:29.890 --> 00:03:39.920
 salt pepper and salt pepper a little 

00:03:36.350 --> 00:03:42.459
 with cherry but is it to taste 

00:03:39.920 --> 00:03:46.209
 You can add all kinds of weed 

00:03:42.459 --> 00:03:46.209
 to be your taste 

00:03:46.510 --> 00:03:58.360
 all hooked up bay mix and 

00:03:50.300 --> 00:03:58.360
 add two yolks again 

00:03:58.510 --> 00:04:02.170
 strangers interfere 

00:04:02.470 --> 00:04:08.020
 it is very possible by the way to add here 

00:04:04.550 --> 00:04:10.490
 parsley salad salad in this sauce 

00:04:08.020 --> 00:04:13.850
 parsley can be added the same way all 

00:04:10.490 --> 00:04:14.930
 turn off the oven oven oven parsley 

00:04:13.850 --> 00:04:17.390
 mint 

00:04:14.930 --> 00:04:23.410
 dry mint anything any spices 

00:04:17.390 --> 00:04:23.410
 already to your taste and in fact we are now 

00:04:24.190 --> 00:04:33.800
 pieces of cheese and we add here already 

00:04:28.160 --> 00:04:35.630
 chicken pot small I generally 

00:04:33.800 --> 00:04:38.290
 big pot like a leg is not for 

00:04:35.630 --> 00:04:38.290
 this is not wanted 

00:04:39.760 --> 00:04:45.260
 I didnâ€™t burn a chicken very finely 

00:04:43.090 --> 00:04:47.240
 cut of course the less the tastier 

00:04:45.260 --> 00:04:48.620
 there will be either volume like mince type and 

00:04:47.240 --> 00:04:51.020
 make up very shallow 

00:04:48.620 --> 00:04:53.540
 I certainly understand everything well how to spend on 

00:04:51.020 --> 00:04:56.380
 this time, believe the taste of this much 

00:04:53.540 --> 00:05:01.370
 does not change on how much 

00:04:56.380 --> 00:05:03.320
 it's all chopped up and because the chicken 

00:05:01.370 --> 00:05:06.770
 softly she already beat the fuck 

00:05:03.320 --> 00:05:12.620
 so much taste so as not spoil 

00:05:06.770 --> 00:05:15.200
 In principle, our preparation will affect everything 

00:05:12.620 --> 00:05:17.870
 how can you even say stuffing ready it 

00:05:15.200 --> 00:05:21.380
 see something like dough on 

00:05:17.870 --> 00:05:25.070
 apple pancakes for booking 

00:05:21.380 --> 00:05:26.810
 so any video yes it should already by 

00:05:25.070 --> 00:05:30.229
 Essentially the refrigerator put a little bit well 

00:05:26.810 --> 00:05:32.830
 since we have no time we have a little bit 

00:05:30.229 --> 00:05:35.540
 give it a bridge to not be hot 

00:05:32.830 --> 00:05:37.400
 That's how it is fried as a cutlet as a matter of fact 

00:05:35.540 --> 00:05:39.500
 pancakes they stood text with us 

00:05:37.400 --> 00:05:41.710
 little dough mince billet in 

00:05:39.500 --> 00:05:44.300
 Refrigerator 15 minutes in general 2-3 hours 

00:05:41.710 --> 00:05:46.070
 if you want direct prescription cook 

00:05:44.300 --> 00:05:48.650
 23 hours leave the fridge is all 

00:05:46.070 --> 00:05:50.690
 a little freeze then you need to roll 

00:05:48.650 --> 00:05:53.990
 walnut - sized 

00:05:50.690 --> 00:05:56.139
 take the mince with a tablespoon of about 

00:05:53.990 --> 00:05:58.389
 take about a kilo in flour 

00:05:56.139 --> 00:06:01.090
 c and in breadcrumbs and lay out 

00:05:58.389 --> 00:06:03.060
 On a frying pan we fry but basically such 

00:06:01.090 --> 00:06:05.439
 the result is what these burgers look like 

00:06:03.060 --> 00:06:08.099
 all bon appetit hope you 

00:06:05.439 --> 00:06:08.099
 liked the recipe
