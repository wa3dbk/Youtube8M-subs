 the professional boxer and from there he started 

00:00:14.910 --> 00:00:20.850
 like the taste I started at 15 years old 

00:00:17.430 --> 00:00:23.250
 ibeth the rock zamora has contended in 36 

00:00:20.850 --> 00:00:25.680

00:00:25.680 --> 00:00:30.779
 golden gloves and the revelation of the year 

00:00:27.720 --> 00:00:33.059
 I am a national champion in 2008 and 

00:00:30.779 --> 00:00:34.620
 we are crowned world champions of 

00:00:33.059 --> 00:00:36.820
 world boxing association that was in 

00:00:34.620 --> 00:00:38.980
 the city of panama 

00:00:36.820 --> 00:00:41.739
 by the way I at the time I had 

00:00:38.980 --> 00:00:43.360
 20 years and it was the Latin American 

00:00:41.739 --> 00:00:45.460
 young man in winning a title of him and in this 

00:00:43.360 --> 00:00:46.900
 year last March 3 we valued 

00:00:45.460 --> 00:00:49.120
 champions of the world boxing council 

00:00:46.900 --> 00:00:51.610
 the most prestigious body is 

00:00:49.120 --> 00:00:53.800
 quite be a native of san cristóbal 

00:00:51.610 --> 00:00:55.960
 Huichochitlan and descent automía 

00:00:53.800 --> 00:00:58.180
 and complicated strabismus to enter 

00:00:55.960 --> 00:01:00.519
 in a sport that for his family was 

00:00:58.180 --> 00:01:03.400
 only for men words that she 

00:01:00.519 --> 00:01:05.229
 it became a challenge it was complicated 

00:01:03.400 --> 00:01:08.680
 because we are good for women 

00:01:05.229 --> 00:01:11.380
 then not as there is no support 

00:01:08.680 --> 00:01:13.270
 because my parents good that way not 

00:01:11.380 --> 00:01:15.910
 I wish I have pure girls as I go to 

00:01:13.270 --> 00:01:18.070
 allow my daughter to hit her and 

00:01:15.910 --> 00:01:19.899
 good in a gym because it is characterized 

00:01:18.070 --> 00:01:22.270
 being a sport it is characterized 

00:01:19.899 --> 00:01:25.600
 for being a men's sport and also 

00:01:22.270 --> 00:01:28.180
 it was like my mom like the danger that 

00:01:25.600 --> 00:01:30.130
 I was immersed in a sport 

00:01:28.180 --> 00:01:31.810
 that was for man with support from his 

00:01:30.130 --> 00:01:34.600
 family of the revolutionary party 

00:01:31.810 --> 00:01:36.520
 institutional and the rock zamora has 

00:01:34.600 --> 00:01:39.190
 managed to maintain eight years of career 

00:01:36.520 --> 00:01:40.900
 becoming a successful boxer to 

00:01:39.190 --> 00:01:43.500
 mexiquense what opened the doors 

00:01:40.900 --> 00:01:46.050
 inside the game for me out 

00:01:43.500 --> 00:01:49.560
 it was an advance first as a woman and 

00:01:46.050 --> 00:01:51.780
 later as an athlete because then that 

00:01:49.560 --> 00:01:53.850
 go to inspire a support then the truth 

00:01:51.780 --> 00:01:55.350
 is that he never left now on the part of the 

00:01:53.850 --> 00:01:58.530
 labor party is that it breathes all the 

00:01:55.350 --> 00:02:02.880
 I've been support since I was just a champion 

00:01:58.530 --> 00:02:04.530
 national and I do say that it was headquarters for 

00:02:02.880 --> 00:02:06.390
 form by the party then to then 

00:02:04.530 --> 00:02:08.970
 we take these titles and they are theirs 

00:02:06.390 --> 00:02:10.950
 whitfield erding is not only with gloves 

00:02:08.970 --> 00:02:14.420
 now he also fights because more 

00:02:10.950 --> 00:02:16.849
 young women are integrated into this discipline 

00:02:14.420 --> 00:02:18.290
 girls are already approaching the trade of 

00:02:16.849 --> 00:02:20.060
 voice and then it 's a breakthrough for our 

00:02:18.290 --> 00:02:21.260
 community and us as you take me 

00:02:20.060 --> 00:02:22.680
 I always say it, I am proudly 

00:02:21.260 --> 00:02:26.870
 as well 

00:02:22.680 --> 00:02:29.370
 I do not like to highlight my roots 

00:02:26.870 --> 00:02:31.409
 proudly militant of the pri and we're going 

00:02:29.370 --> 00:02:34.469
 to continue being because it has good 

00:02:31.409 --> 00:02:38.930
 projects and I think that putting is being part 

00:02:34.469 --> 00:02:38.930
 of that party pass for me
