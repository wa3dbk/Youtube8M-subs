00:05:15.930 --> 00:05:18.290 
this way when the waves are done here
they<00:05:16.620> will<00:05:16.830> come<00:05:17.130> over<00:05:17.160> here<00:05:17.490> and<00:05:17.820> you<00:05:18.060> already

00:05:18.290 --> 00:05:18.300 
they will come over here and you already

00:05:18.300 --> 00:05:20.270 
they will come over here and you already
have<00:05:18.540> two<00:05:18.750> pokemon<00:05:19.200> attacking<00:05:19.740> and<00:05:19.950> then<00:05:20.100> you

00:05:20.270 --> 00:05:20.280 
have two pokemon attacking and then you

00:05:20.280 --> 00:05:23.090 
have two pokemon attacking and then you
can<00:05:20.460> start<00:05:20.760> moving<00:05:21.270> them<00:05:21.570> back<00:05:21.810> and<00:05:22.080> forth<00:05:22.140> in

00:05:23.090 --> 00:05:23.100 
can start moving them back and forth in

00:05:23.100 --> 00:05:24.620 
can start moving them back and forth in
this<00:05:23.280> way<00:05:23.460> so<00:05:23.520> now<00:05:23.640> that<00:05:24.060> the<00:05:24.150> waves<00:05:24.330> did

00:05:24.620 --> 00:05:24.630 
this way so now that the waves did

00:05:24.630 --> 00:05:27.590 
this way so now that the waves did
switch<00:05:24.930> we<00:05:25.290> will<00:05:25.320> have<00:05:25.680> time<00:05:26.010> to<00:05:26.880> fill<00:05:27.330> up<00:05:27.450> the

00:05:27.590 --> 00:05:27.600 
switch we will have time to fill up the

00:05:27.600 --> 00:05:30.050 
switch we will have time to fill up the
back<00:05:27.840> right<00:05:28.680> here<00:05:29.040> with<00:05:29.190> these<00:05:29.340> Pokemon<00:05:29.910> which

00:05:30.050 --> 00:05:30.060 
back right here with these Pokemon which

00:05:30.060 --> 00:05:31.310 
back right here with these Pokemon which
is<00:05:30.210> pretty<00:05:30.390> sweet<00:05:30.630> and<00:05:30.720> I<00:05:30.780> really<00:05:30.840> like<00:05:31.200> how

00:05:31.310 --> 00:05:31.320 
is pretty sweet and I really like how

00:05:31.320 --> 00:05:32.810 
is pretty sweet and I really like how
the<00:05:31.380> Zoras<00:05:31.770> turned<00:05:31.980> into<00:05:32.130> the<00:05:32.340> shiny<00:05:32.550> rhino

00:05:32.810 --> 00:05:32.820 
the Zoras turned into the shiny rhino

00:05:32.820 --> 00:05:33.380 
the Zoras turned into the shiny rhino
