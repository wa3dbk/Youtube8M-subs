00:00:00.589 --> 00:00:05.819
 and connected again with montecarlo 4 

00:00:04.080 --> 00:00:08.490
 minutes and 40 seconds to the conclusion 

00:00:05.819 --> 00:00:10.490
 of the qualifications of the Grand Prix of 

00:00:08.490 --> 00:00:12.960
 monk sixth seasonal appointment 

00:00:10.490 --> 00:00:15.660
 remember that in the standings fernando 

00:00:12.960 --> 00:00:18.570
 alonso after the triumph of barcelona is a 

00:00:15.660 --> 00:00:21.000
 minus 17 from slices less than 14 from 

00:00:18.570 --> 00:00:23.850
 raikkonen and they are the three of them for now 

00:00:21.000 --> 00:00:25.740
 the 2013 world championships play 

00:00:23.850 --> 00:00:28.019
 we remember in the last three seasons three 

00:00:25.740 --> 00:00:29.880
 the two world victories perfect 

00:00:28.019 --> 00:00:32.399
 defeats at the photo finish and for Ferrari 

00:00:29.880 --> 00:00:34.380
 of fernando alonso in 2010 2012 

00:00:32.399 --> 00:00:36.000
 announcement that seeks redemption in this 

00:00:34.380 --> 00:00:37.649
 season in which the Ferrari is really 

00:00:36.000 --> 00:00:39.629
 very competitive 

00:00:37.649 --> 00:00:42.270
 we are in the jenson button single-seater 

00:00:39.629 --> 00:00:45.629
 facing the devil holy shovel curve 

00:00:42.270 --> 00:00:48.530
 and then in full rectilinear it rises and towards 

00:00:45.629 --> 00:00:51.770
 the curve the double curve of the 

00:00:48.530 --> 00:00:54.410
 of the casino comes out of the pits and fernando 

00:00:51.770 --> 00:00:57.559
 alonso who for now occupies the fifth 

00:00:54.410 --> 00:01:00.980
 position behind hamilton that fourth 

00:00:57.559 --> 00:01:03.199
 rosberg, therefore, third the two mercedes 

00:01:00.980 --> 00:01:04.729
 in third and fourth position and in first and 

00:01:03.199 --> 00:01:07.250
 second position we find the two red 

00:01:04.729 --> 00:01:09.800
 bull of vettel and weber than now 

00:01:07.250 --> 00:01:12.080
 the boxes come back and the tires change and 

00:01:09.800 --> 00:01:14.899
 for the last attempt available 

00:01:12.080 --> 00:01:16.700
 now it's for all the drivers we remember 

00:01:14.899 --> 00:01:18.799
 so the situation your redmond 

00:01:16.700 --> 00:01:20.990
 forward with slices the first and weber 

00:01:18.799 --> 00:01:22.880
 according to the two mercedes in the third e 

00:01:20.990 --> 00:01:25.759
 fourth position with rosberg and hamilton 

00:01:22.880 --> 00:01:28.729
 then has the ferrari of fernando alonso e 

00:01:25.759 --> 00:01:31.670
 kimi raikkonen and seventh lotus 

00:01:28.729 --> 00:01:34.340
 button eighth perez both with le 

00:01:31.670 --> 00:01:37.310
 mclaren not to have and with the red bull 

00:01:34.340 --> 00:01:39.530
 tenth sutil with the force india 

00:01:37.310 --> 00:01:40.460
 these placements with three minutes 

00:01:39.530 --> 00:01:43.399
 conclusion 

00:01:40.460 --> 00:01:45.560
 we are now in the lewis single-seater 

00:01:43.399 --> 00:01:48.020
 hamilton facing the double curve 

00:01:45.560 --> 00:01:51.140
 of the pools and then leads to the 

00:01:48.020 --> 00:01:53.000
 rascasse entering and into the funnel of the 

00:01:51.140 --> 00:01:54.380
 main straight but also hamilton 

00:01:53.000 --> 00:01:57.340
 back to the pits 

00:01:54.380 --> 00:01:59.310
 we are now following the turn of them stopped 

00:01:57.340 --> 00:02:01.020
 this is the engine of his ferrari 

00:01:59.310 --> 00:02:02.670
 the double curve of the pools does not risk 

00:02:01.020 --> 00:02:05.520
 alonso because he is making the rounds of 

00:02:02.670 --> 00:02:07.170
 launch after that and after this 

00:02:05.520 --> 00:02:09.320
 the scarce that you face in droves in first 

00:02:07.170 --> 00:02:09.320
 march 

00:02:21.030 --> 00:02:25.950
 holy devotee a detached who faces 

00:02:23.819 --> 00:02:28.230
 at least 100 meters ahead 

00:02:25.950 --> 00:02:30.810
 compared to the ideal conditions of the 

00:02:28.230 --> 00:02:39.390
 traced before entering the 

00:02:30.810 --> 00:02:41.400
 long climb that leads to them 

00:02:39.390 --> 00:02:43.510
 telling raikkonen by radio that he must 

00:02:41.400 --> 00:02:45.159
 push now because there is one 

00:02:43.510 --> 00:02:47.829
 a possibility that I can start again 

00:02:45.159 --> 00:02:49.360
 rain in the next thirty seconds in the 

00:02:47.829 --> 00:02:51.849
 next minute and then tell him 

00:02:49.360 --> 00:02:53.829
 pushes now because he could come back 

00:02:51.849 --> 00:02:56.140
 rain and then kimi raikkonen inside 

00:02:53.829 --> 00:02:58.390
 is looking for the tempone and not for now 

00:02:56.140 --> 00:02:59.860
 he can't do it because the second sector 

00:02:58.390 --> 00:03:01.780
 it's high enough 

00:02:59.860 --> 00:03:04.569
 the situation does not always change in front 

00:03:01.780 --> 00:03:06.549
 to the two red bulls and to the first potential 

00:03:04.569 --> 00:03:08.860
 row in second potential row we find 

00:03:06.549 --> 00:03:11.019
 the two mercedes of rosberg and hamilton e 

00:03:08.860 --> 00:03:13.400
 alonso is always fifth ahead of kimi 

00:03:11.019 --> 00:03:15.670
 raikkonen is a colossus 

00:03:13.400 --> 00:03:17.350
 he is taking the alonso tires 

00:03:15.670 --> 00:03:20.550
 for him 

00:03:17.350 --> 00:03:20.550
 curve that brings the pools 

00:03:23.090 --> 00:03:25.790
 which with much tranquility from 

00:03:24.470 --> 00:03:28.099
 fernando alonso who evidently was 

00:03:25.790 --> 00:03:30.680
 already noticed erroneously in the second sector 

00:03:28.099 --> 00:03:32.780
 to have made a long time and therefore has 

00:03:30.680 --> 00:03:35.660
 practically aborted the tour is now 

00:03:32.780 --> 00:03:37.400
 simply pointing to 

00:03:35.660 --> 00:03:39.050
 to send the tires to the ideal temperature 

00:03:37.400 --> 00:03:40.610
 before facing the last round all 

00:03:39.050 --> 00:03:42.920
 last lap because one minute is missing 

00:03:40.610 --> 00:03:44.120
 at the conclusion therefore last attempt 

00:03:42.920 --> 00:03:45.920
 for alonso 

00:03:44.120 --> 00:03:48.230
 we will follow his performance step by step 

00:03:45.920 --> 00:03:51.050
 because for now there are two in front of it 

00:03:48.230 --> 00:03:53.630
 red bull and the two mercedes attention e 

00:03:51.050 --> 00:03:55.940
 rosberg and 19 to 3 in the first sector 

00:03:53.630 --> 00:03:58.010
 rosberg in substantial pole position 

00:03:55.940 --> 00:03:59.750
 we see that weber answers in 

00:03:58.010 --> 00:04:03.610
 two tenths delay in the first sector 

00:03:59.750 --> 00:04:03.610
 but great in the second sector 

00:04:05.140 --> 00:04:11.540
 this and button from shooters who pushing 

00:04:08.990 --> 00:04:13.550
 is a phrase now historical in the formula 

00:04:11.540 --> 00:04:16.100
 1 but they know they have to push 

00:04:13.550 --> 00:04:18.260
 we always said great second sector for 

00:04:16.100 --> 00:04:20.270
 weber who won two here in montecarlo 

00:04:18.260 --> 00:04:23.090
 of the last three editions and that's it 

00:04:20.270 --> 00:04:25.970
 get the provisional pole mark webber 

00:04:23.090 --> 00:04:28.130
 in front of vettel 1 14 percent against one 

00:04:25.970 --> 00:04:30.290
 14 33 pole teammates 

00:04:28.130 --> 00:04:32.660
 temporary for weber in front and beautiful le 

00:04:30.290 --> 00:04:34.880
 rajko came and gets better and goes to third 

00:04:32.660 --> 00:04:37.100
 position in front of the two mercedes e 

00:04:34.880 --> 00:04:40.040
 therefore kimi raikkonen is among the red bulls 

00:04:37.100 --> 00:04:41.980
 and among the mercedes while alonso with 19 7 

00:04:40.040 --> 00:04:44.110
 the first sector 34 and 8 in the second 

00:04:41.980 --> 00:04:47.300
 will hardly be able to improve 

00:04:44.110 --> 00:04:48.760
 even going to slip into the top 

00:04:47.300 --> 00:04:51.550
 let's see some 

00:04:48.760 --> 00:04:53.620
 hamilton is improved and improved too 

00:04:51.550 --> 00:04:57.220
 rosberg and rosberg and provisional pole 

00:04:53.620 --> 00:04:59.200
 in front of hamilton webber third set e 

00:04:57.220 --> 00:05:01.480
 in the fourth they slide into the second row 

00:04:59.200 --> 00:05:03.550
 two red bulls passed by the two mercedes 

00:05:01.480 --> 00:05:05.530
 and just to the photo finish in a very short time 

00:05:03.550 --> 00:05:07.600
 of the little words to al gr1 but we must 

00:05:05.530 --> 00:05:09.850
 follow the very last round by 

00:05:07.600 --> 00:05:12.460
 weber that fails to improve o 

00:05:09.850 --> 00:05:14.530
 at least in the first sector is a tenth the 

00:05:12.460 --> 00:05:17.260
 delay in the second sector is too much 

00:05:14.530 --> 00:05:19.630
 slow then we confirm you the best 

00:05:17.260 --> 00:05:21.280
 times for the two mercedes of rosberg ed 

00:05:19.630 --> 00:05:23.050
 hamilton that go to conquer 

00:05:21.280 --> 00:05:25.000
 the entire front row in the grand prix of 

00:05:23.050 --> 00:05:27.130
 montecarlo in front of the two red bull of 

00:05:25.000 --> 00:05:29.350
 vettel and webber fifth rai with enel 

00:05:27.130 --> 00:05:31.210
 sixth alonso the minimum objective is 

00:05:29.350 --> 00:05:36.180
 Asked for an advance is not reached 

00:05:31.210 --> 00:05:36.180
 alonso will start the sixth line at gr1
