00:01:31.700 --> 00:01:31.710 
and for my first approach I'll show you

00:01:31.710 --> 00:01:33.740 
and for my first approach I'll show you

and in my second approach we'll play the

00:01:45.600 --> 00:01:57.950 
and in my second approach we'll play the
same<00:01:45.810> progression<00:01:46.440> but<00:01:46.830> in<00:01:46.980> an<00:01:47.130> open<00:01:47.550> G<00:01:47.790> tuning

progression in the key of E and in my

00:02:04.690 --> 00:02:06.660 
progression in the key of E and in my
first<00:02:04.900> approach<00:02:05.350> I'll<00:02:05.650> use<00:02:05.860> a<00:02:05.890> descending

00:02:06.660 --> 00:02:06.670 
first approach I'll use a descending

00:02:06.670 --> 00:02:14.530 
first approach I'll use a descending
fifth<00:02:07.000> pattern

00:02:14.530 --> 00:02:14.540 

00:02:14.540 --> 00:02:17.289 

in<00:02:14.950> my<00:02:15.950> second<00:02:16.370> approach<00:02:16.700> we<00:02:17.000> will<00:02:17.060> use<00:02:17.269> a

00:02:17.289 --> 00:02:17.299 
in my second approach we will use a

00:02:17.299 --> 00:02:19.809 
in my second approach we will use a
triplet<00:02:17.870> feel<00:02:18.110> strum<00:02:18.709> over<00:02:19.459> the<00:02:19.579> same

00:02:19.809 --> 00:02:19.819 
triplet feel strum over the same

00:02:19.819 --> 00:02:28.220 
triplet feel strum over the same
progression

00:02:28.220 --> 00:02:28.230 

00:02:28.230 --> 00:02:32.610 

I'll<00:02:29.230> show<00:02:29.620> you<00:02:29.680> at<00:02:30.010> one<00:02:30.250> one<00:02:31.180> major<00:02:31.620> 71

00:02:32.610 --> 00:02:32.620 
I'll show you at one one major 71

00:02:35.339 --> 00:02:35.349 
dominant seventh for chord progression

00:02:35.349 --> 00:02:37.949 
dominant seventh for chord progression
in<00:02:35.440> the<00:02:35.560> key<00:02:35.590> of<00:02:35.770> D<00:02:35.920> and<00:02:36.520> in<00:02:37.120> my<00:02:37.239> first<00:02:37.510> approach

00:02:37.949 --> 00:02:37.959 
in the key of D and in my first approach

00:02:37.959 --> 00:02:40.080 
in the key of D and in my first approach
I'll<00:02:38.530> show<00:02:38.800> you<00:02:38.860> an<00:02:39.040> eighth<00:02:39.280> note<00:02:39.310> strumming

00:02:40.080 --> 00:02:40.090 
I'll show you an eighth note strumming

00:02:40.090 --> 00:02:52.420 
I'll show you an eighth note strumming
pattern<00:02:40.569> that's<00:02:40.870> very<00:02:41.170> syncopated

00:02:52.420 --> 00:02:52.430 

00:02:52.430 --> 00:02:55.420 

we'll<00:02:53.390> use<00:02:53.420> a<00:02:53.599> drop<00:02:54.019> D<00:02:54.319> tuning<00:02:54.349> for<00:02:55.040> the<00:02:55.129> second

00:02:55.420 --> 00:02:55.430 
we'll use a drop D tuning for the second

00:02:55.430 --> 00:02:57.970 
we'll use a drop D tuning for the second
approach<00:02:55.670> with<00:02:56.299> hammer<00:02:56.629> ons<00:02:56.870> and<00:02:57.230> harmonic

tapping

00:03:17.640 --> 00:03:17.650 

00:03:17.650 --> 00:03:21.280 

we'll<00:03:18.650> look<00:03:18.800> at<00:03:18.920> a<00:03:18.950> longer<00:03:19.280> progression<00:03:20.290> six

00:03:21.280 --> 00:03:21.290 
we'll look at a longer progression six

00:03:21.290 --> 00:03:26.380 
we'll look at a longer progression six
two<00:03:21.970> five<00:03:22.970> one<00:03:23.500> four<00:03:24.500> minor<00:03:25.340> four<00:03:25.730> and<00:03:25.940> back<00:03:26.120> to

00:03:54.809 --> 00:03:54.819 
the same progression using sliding

00:03:54.819 --> 00:04:12.850 
the same progression using sliding
sixths<00:03:55.360> in<00:03:55.540> the<00:03:55.750> upper<00:03:55.959> register

I'll show you a one flat seven flat six
five<00:04:17.660> progression<00:04:17.989> in<00:04:18.530> the<00:04:18.799> key<00:04:18.830> of<00:04:19.070> C<00:04:19.310> minor

five progression in the key of C minor

00:04:19.549 --> 00:04:21.880 
five progression in the key of C minor
in<00:04:19.940> my<00:04:20.570> first<00:04:20.900> approach<00:04:21.200> I'll<00:04:21.530> show<00:04:21.709> you<00:04:21.769> a

00:04:21.880 --> 00:04:21.890

00:04:32.360 --> 00:04:32.370 

00:04:32.370 --> 00:04:35.570 

in<00:04:32.730> my<00:04:33.720> second<00:04:34.110> approach<00:04:34.380> we'll<00:04:34.800> use<00:04:35.010> the<00:04:35.190> capo

00:04:35.570 --> 00:04:35.580 
in my second approach we'll use the capo

00:04:35.580 --> 00:04:37.430 
in my second approach we'll use the capo
on<00:04:35.730> the<00:04:35.850> third<00:04:36.090> fret<00:04:36.510> to<00:04:36.900> play<00:04:37.110> the<00:04:37.260> same

00:04:37.430 --> 00:04:37.440 
on the third fret to play the same

00:04:37.440 --> 00:04:39.560 
on the third fret to play the same
progression<00:04:37.680> but<00:04:38.250> with<00:04:38.370> more<00:04:38.610> open<00:04:39.150> sounding

00:04:39.560 --> 00:04:39.570 
progression but with more open sounding

00:04:39.570 --> 00:04:49.600 
progression but with more open sounding
chords

00:04:49.600 --> 00:04:49.610 

00:04:49.610 --> 00:04:52.580 

those<00:04:50.610> are<00:04:50.790> only<00:04:50.910> five<00:04:51.330> of<00:04:51.360> the<00:04:51.690> fifteen<00:04:52.200> chord

00:04:52.580 --> 00:04:52.590 
those are only five of the fifteen chord

00:04:52.590 --> 00:04:53.840 
those are only five of the fifteen chord
progressions<00:04:53.010> we're<00:04:53.160> going<00:04:53.280> to<00:04:53.340> work<00:04:53.520> with<00:04:53.700> in

00:04:53.840 --> 00:04:53.850 
progressions we're going to work with in

00:04:53.850 --> 00:04:55.700 
progressions we're going to work with in
this<00:04:53.970> course<00:04:54.210> and<00:04:54.540> I'm<00:04:55.050> not<00:04:55.260> only<00:04:55.440> going<00:04:55.620> to

00:04:55.700 --> 00:04:55.710 
this course and I'm not only going to

00:04:55.710 --> 00:04:57.379 
this course and I'm not only going to
play<00:04:55.950> them<00:04:56.190> for<00:04:56.220> you<00:04:56.520> but<00:04:56.850> I'm<00:04:56.940> going<00:04:57.090> to<00:04:57.150> break

play them for you but I'm going to break

00:04:57.389 --> 00:04:59.060 
play them for you but I'm going to break
down<00:04:57.419> each<00:04:57.870> one<00:04:58.020> of<00:04:58.410> them<00:04:58.530> so<00:04:58.740> you'll<00:04:58.889> know

00:04:59.060 --> 00:04:59.070 
down each one of them so you'll know

00:04:59.070 --> 00:05:04.640 
down each one of them so you'll know
exactly<00:04:59.550> what<00:04:59.790> I'm<00:04:59.910> doing<00:05:03.230> all<00:05:04.230> of<00:05:04.290> the

00:05:04.640 --> 00:05:04.650 
exactly what I'm doing all of the

00:05:04.650 --> 00:05:06.050 
exactly what I'm doing all of the
patterns<00:05:05.040> are<00:05:05.190> going<00:05:05.250> to<00:05:05.370> be<00:05:05.490> tabbed<00:05:05.790> and

00:05:06.050 --> 00:05:06.060 
patterns are going to be tabbed and

00:05:06.060 --> 00:05:07.730 
patterns are going to be tabbed and
notated<00:05:06.720> and<00:05:06.840> you're<00:05:07.080> going<00:05:07.200> to<00:05:07.260> get<00:05:07.410> all<00:05:07.590> the

00:05:07.730 --> 00:05:07.740 
notated and you're going to get all the

00:05:07.740 --> 00:05:10.000 
notated and you're going to get all the
rhythm<00:05:08.070> tracks<00:05:08.370> that<00:05:08.520> I've<00:05:08.669> used<00:05:08.940> as<00:05:09.240> well

00:05:10.000 --> 00:05:10.010 
rhythm tracks that I've used as well

00:05:10.010 --> 00:05:12.530 
rhythm tracks that I've used as well
well<00:05:11.010> there's<00:05:11.190> nothing<00:05:11.550> else<00:05:11.639> to<00:05:11.850> say<00:05:12.090> besides
