00:00:00.280 --> 00:00:05.000
 that's sort of formulated as a hot-washed helicopter district class 

00:00:05.000 --> 00:00:07.340
 that's such a gyrocopter 

00:00:07.340 --> 00:00:08.820
 therefore have to continue 

00:00:08.820 --> 00:00:12.560
 In principle, as with helicopters, the difference is these rotors will not 

00:00:12.560 --> 00:00:13.869
 driven 

00:00:13.869 --> 00:00:17.630
 The only massive propulsion ensures is this propeller at the rear 

00:00:18.599 --> 00:00:19.970
 and by the wind 

00:00:19.970 --> 00:00:25.070
 Peter in the Rother set in motion and not Kaman actually stand out 

00:00:25.070 --> 00:00:28.179
 I was allowed to give it up to 17 

00:00:28.929 --> 00:00:31.929
 so it looks just above the ground then it went up 

00:00:33.010 --> 00:00:35.760
 It was not so little as I had thought, although clearly 

00:00:35.760 --> 00:00:36.980
 calmer than me 

00:00:36.980 --> 00:00:40.360
 after the release with powerful but was not forgotten 

00:00:40.360 --> 00:00:41.940
 great view 

00:00:41.940 --> 00:00:44.950
 even though we admittedly were not that high 

00:00:46.670 --> 00:00:49.340
 and percent next to 

00:00:49.340 --> 00:00:54.280
 Home was jealous Frohloff 4-liter the tire belongs to her this only went 

00:00:54.280 --> 00:00:57.970
 Head there is the flight instructor for learning at airfields will make you feel better 

00:00:57.970 --> 00:01:01.570
 We are also just said at the 2 the little red so that the one 

00:01:01.570 --> 00:01:04.699
 otherwise everything is available but must but that's a Sunday the big one 

00:01:04.699 --> 00:01:06.040
 difference 

00:01:06.040 --> 00:01:08.460
 greeted and hostile both difference to the helicopter 

00:01:08.460 --> 00:01:12.210
 that in the austerity package the air is pressed from top to bottom and thereby 

00:01:12.210 --> 00:01:16.470
 a vertical from the gyrocopter before the wind in the fall if the 

00:01:16.470 --> 00:01:20.190
 Air flows from the bottom up through the router through contracts a little 

00:01:20.190 --> 00:01:21.740
 the nerves 

00:01:21.740 --> 00:01:25.140
 now you can now he needs the device for a long time I think so 

00:01:25.140 --> 00:01:25.780
 wanted to do 

00:01:25.780 --> 00:01:30.330
 you do not need at least 60% of her and about 30 faxes hours 

00:01:30.330 --> 00:01:33.960
 and that would be about a price range of 7000 euros 

00:01:33.960 --> 00:01:36.830
 the long customs now so in order in real time for it carries 

00:01:36.830 --> 00:01:38.859
 of course, depending on each one of them 

00:01:38.859 --> 00:01:41.999
 Who's how much time you bring if you come every day though once a week 

00:01:41.999 --> 00:01:43.000
 coming 

00:01:43.000 --> 00:01:46.620
 that's hard to say, so some create channels two months later 

00:01:46.620 --> 00:01:48.980
 in the open position 

00:01:48.980 --> 00:01:52.550
 is a bit like the aircraft at 100 euros with the safest thing 

00:01:52.550 --> 00:01:55.070
 the safest aircraft that is theft 

00:01:55.070 --> 00:01:58.790
 its one year older principle works on the author or at sea 

00:01:58.790 --> 00:02:03.060
 Norbert Lammert noted at the consumption of the stock market and wind slowly to the ground 

00:02:03.060 --> 00:02:06.190
 Out is the first during transport 

00:02:06.190 --> 00:02:09.760
 Belgians say I'm relinquishing Liebig Waldhausen volcanic ash to a 

00:02:09.760 --> 00:02:12.699
 the line flows her likes that I think so very often 

00:02:12.699 --> 00:02:15.629
 A gyrocopter can also be seen that way, but that's because 

00:02:15.629 --> 00:02:17.789
 the engine fails 

00:02:17.789 --> 00:02:19.339
 yes we are here in LohmÃ¼hle 

00:02:19.339 --> 00:02:22.519
 the ball lands plane is still here before this one case in the beer gardens 

00:02:22.519 --> 00:02:24.069
 at the moment 

00:02:24.069 --> 00:02:27.620
 Many people start here and land single engine look at it and thereby 

00:02:27.620 --> 00:02:31.530
 that is the balmy summer evenings but that was different from there at the tower 

00:02:31.530 --> 00:02:35.790
 quite a need to talk for the radio to see who comes and who comes 

00:02:35.790 --> 00:02:38.059
 not and that was above all else 

00:02:38.059 --> 00:02:40.569
 Airplanes so no engine he 

00:02:40.569 --> 00:02:44.129
 But you do not have to go directly to the bill to be able to do so 

00:02:44.129 --> 00:02:48.259
 You can also just as rosy and you were in the air 

00:02:48.259 --> 00:02:52.919
 Pike is an experience and it does too 

00:02:52.919 --> 00:02:53.969
 little bit at the temperatures
