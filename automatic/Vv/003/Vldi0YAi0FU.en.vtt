if<00:00:12.100> you're<00:00:12.280> wondering<00:00:12.580> what<00:00:12.700> I'm<00:00:12.820> doing

00:00:13.320 --> 00:00:13.330 
if you're wondering what I'm doing

00:00:13.330 --> 00:00:17.160 
if you're wondering what I'm doing
oddly<00:00:14.290> enough<00:00:14.559> i<00:00:14.860> am<00:00:15.010> i<00:00:15.600> checking<00:00:16.600> my<00:00:16.930> tire

00:00:17.160 --> 00:00:17.170 
oddly enough i am i checking my tire

oddly enough i am i checking my tire
pressure<00:00:17.550> the<00:00:18.550> pyrometer

00:00:20.320 --> 00:00:20.330

I haven't driven the truck yet what I'm

00:00:23.000 --> 00:00:25.330 
I haven't driven the truck yet what I'm
going<00:00:23.180> to<00:00:23.240> do<00:00:23.470> is<00:00:24.470> check<00:00:24.860> all<00:00:25.070> the<00:00:25.160> tire

00:00:25.330 --> 00:00:25.340 
going to do is check all the tire

00:00:25.340 --> 00:00:28.929 
going to do is check all the tire

pressures on each side inside outside
and<00:00:29.000> Center<00:00:29.599> let's<00:00:30.290> check<00:00:30.590> all<00:00:30.619> the<00:00:30.830> tire

00:00:30.999 --> 00:00:31.009 
and Center let's check all the tire

00:00:31.009 --> 00:00:33.970 
and Center let's check all the tire
pressures<00:00:31.490> are<00:00:31.669> all<00:00:31.790> up<00:00:32.750> to<00:00:32.809> the<00:00:33.650> proper

pressure bail 28 psi and I'm going to

00:00:39.170 --> 00:00:43.770 
pressure bail 28 psi and I'm going to
take<00:00:39.379> it<00:00:39.500> for<00:00:39.680> a<00:00:39.710> run<00:00:40.900> that

00:00:43.770 --> 00:00:43.780 
take it for a run that

00:00:43.780 --> 00:00:51.880 
take it for a run that
we<00:00:44.170> got<00:00:44.490> 50.7<00:00:45.490> left<00:00:45.790> side<00:00:46.860> 57

right now and I will show you or them up

00:00:57.140 --> 00:00:58.990 
right now and I will show you or them up
to<00:00:57.290> when<00:00:57.379> I'm<00:00:57.470> done<00:00:57.590> okay<00:00:57.920> so<00:00:58.670> after<00:00:58.850> a

00:00:58.990 --> 00:00:59.000 
to when I'm done okay so after a

00:00:59.000 --> 00:01:00.610 
to when I'm done okay so after a
10-minute<00:00:59.300> Drive<00:00:59.480> in<00:00:59.809> four-wheel<00:01:00.079> drive<00:01:00.440> on

10-minute Drive in four-wheel drive on
the<00:01:00.710> pavement<00:01:01.160> to<00:01:01.790> warm<00:01:02.000> the<00:01:02.090> tires<00:01:02.420> up<00:01:02.600> it's

00:01:03.280 --> 00:01:03.290 
the pavement to warm the tires up it's

00:01:03.290 --> 00:01:04.329 
the pavement to warm the tires up it's
pretty<00:01:03.440> cool<00:01:03.649> that<00:01:03.860> today's<00:01:04.129> there's

00:01:04.329 --> 00:01:04.339 
pretty cool that today's there's

00:01:04.339 --> 00:01:05.469 
pretty cool that today's there's
actually<00:01:04.640> much<00:01:04.820> of<00:01:04.970> a<00:01:05.000> difference<00:01:05.330> in

00:01:05.469 --> 00:01:05.479 
actually much of a difference in

00:01:05.479 --> 00:01:06.550 
actually much of a difference in
temperature<00:01:05.869> but<00:01:05.990> I'm<00:01:06.080> just<00:01:06.170> going<00:01:06.350> to<00:01:06.440> show

00:01:06.550 --> 00:01:06.560 
temperature but I'm just going to show

00:01:06.560 --> 00:01:08.320 
temperature but I'm just going to show
you<00:01:06.619> how<00:01:06.800> to<00:01:06.860> do<00:01:07.010> it<00:01:07.130> anyway

00:01:08.320 --> 00:01:08.330 
you how to do it anyway

00:01:08.330 --> 00:01:10.990 
you how to do it anyway
you<00:01:08.720> would<00:01:08.869> have<00:01:09.080> to<00:01:09.229> make<00:01:09.350> sure<00:01:09.790> that<00:01:10.790> all<00:01:10.940> the

00:01:10.990 --> 00:01:11.000 
you would have to make sure that all the

00:01:11.000 --> 00:01:12.940 
you would have to make sure that all the
tires<00:01:11.210> are<00:01:11.450> inflated<00:01:11.900> to<00:01:12.290> the<00:01:12.470> same<00:01:12.650> pressure

00:01:12.940 --> 00:01:12.950 
tires are inflated to the same pressure

00:01:12.950 --> 00:01:16.210 
tires are inflated to the same pressure
and<00:01:14.050> your<00:01:15.050> alignments<00:01:15.440> out<00:01:15.560> of<00:01:15.650> whack<00:01:15.830> this<00:01:16.070> is

00:01:16.210 --> 00:01:16.220 
and your alignments out of whack this is

00:01:16.220 --> 00:01:18.460 
and your alignments out of whack this is
going<00:01:16.460> to<00:01:16.550> be

00:01:18.460 --> 00:01:18.470 
going to be

00:01:18.470 --> 00:01:21.300 
going to be
really<00:01:18.770> going<00:01:18.860> to<00:01:18.950> work<00:01:19.070> too<00:01:19.220> well<00:01:19.400> for<00:01:19.460> you

00:01:21.300 --> 00:01:21.310 
really going to work too well for you

00:01:21.310 --> 00:01:23.370 
really going to work too well for you
to<00:01:21.670> alignment<00:01:22.090> your<00:01:22.180> reading<00:01:22.540> or<00:01:22.780> your<00:01:23.079> higher

00:01:23.370 --> 00:01:23.380 
to alignment your reading or your higher

00:01:23.380 --> 00:01:25.230 
to alignment your reading or your higher
pressures<00:01:23.799> or<00:01:24.399> you're<00:01:24.579> tired<00:01:24.759> contact

00:01:25.230 --> 00:01:25.240 
pressures or you're tired contact

00:01:25.240 --> 00:01:27.070 
pressures or you're tired contact
conscious<00:01:25.570> and<00:01:25.720> proper

conscious and proper

00:01:27.080 --> 00:01:29.020

so<00:01:27.230> if<00:01:27.350> you've<00:01:27.470> got<00:01:27.620> wider<00:01:27.860> tires<00:01:28.250> in<00:01:28.520> stock<00:01:28.790> if

00:01:29.020 --> 00:01:29.030 
so if you've got wider tires in stock if

00:01:29.030 --> 00:01:31.440 
so if you've got wider tires in stock if
you've<00:01:29.180> got<00:01:29.360> some<00:01:29.570> other

00:01:31.440 --> 00:01:31.450 
you've got some other

00:01:31.450 --> 00:01:33.180 
you've got some other
even<00:01:31.870> the<00:01:31.930> Neal<00:01:32.080> snow<00:01:32.380> tires<00:01:32.650> different

00:01:33.180 --> 00:01:33.190 
even the Neal snow tires different

00:01:33.190 --> 00:01:34.620 
even the Neal snow tires different

00:01:34.620 --> 00:01:34.630 
brands than the stock manufacturer

00:01:34.630 --> 00:01:37.620 
brands than the stock manufacturer
recommends<00:01:35.170> those<00:01:35.380> stocks<00:01:36.240> tire<00:01:37.240> pressures

00:01:37.620 --> 00:01:37.630 
recommends those stocks tire pressures

00:01:37.630 --> 00:01:39.840 
recommends those stocks tire pressures
are<00:01:37.750> going<00:01:37.810> to<00:01:37.930> go<00:01:38.020> out<00:01:38.140> the<00:01:38.260> window

00:01:39.840 --> 00:01:39.850 
are going to go out the window

00:01:39.850 --> 00:01:41.760 
are going to go out the window
cars<00:01:40.270> are<00:01:40.420> designed<00:01:40.540> for<00:01:40.900> the<00:01:41.050> tires<00:01:41.650> that

00:01:41.760 --> 00:01:41.770 
cars are designed for the tires that

00:01:41.770 --> 00:01:45.290 
cars are designed for the tires that
came<00:01:42.040> from<00:01:42.250> the<00:01:42.400> factory<00:01:42.790> with<00:01:42.820> them

00:01:45.290 --> 00:01:45.300 

00:01:45.300 --> 00:01:46.730 

that's<00:01:45.510> the<00:01:45.660> tire<00:01:45.870> pressure<00:01:46.110> they<00:01:46.470> put<00:01:46.650> on

00:01:46.730 --> 00:01:46.740 
that's the tire pressure they put on

00:01:46.740 --> 00:01:48.770 
that's the tire pressure they put on
your<00:01:46.920> car<00:01:47.100> so<00:01:47.400> I<00:01:47.610> mean<00:01:48.180> they're<00:01:48.330> pretty<00:01:48.540> close

00:01:48.770 --> 00:01:48.780 
your car so I mean they're pretty close

00:01:48.780 --> 00:01:50.330 
your car so I mean they're pretty close
but<00:01:49.170> if<00:01:49.410> you<00:01:49.500> want<00:01:49.710> to<00:01:49.800> get<00:01:49.890> them<00:01:49.980> dead<00:01:50.160> on<00:01:50.190> a

00:01:50.330 --> 00:01:50.340 
but if you want to get them dead on a

00:01:50.340 --> 00:01:53.000 
but if you want to get them dead on a
stretch<00:01:50.640> with<00:01:50.790> you<00:01:50.880> put<00:01:51.060> water<00:01:51.270> tires<00:01:51.920> this<00:01:52.920> is

00:01:53.000 --> 00:01:53.010 
stretch with you put water tires this is

00:01:53.010 --> 00:01:55.220 
stretch with you put water tires this is
a<00:01:53.070> good<00:01:53.220> way<00:01:53.340> to<00:01:53.400> do<00:01:53.580> it<00:01:53.810> that's<00:01:54.810> what<00:01:54.930> you<00:01:55.050> want

00:01:55.220 --> 00:01:55.230 
a good way to do it that's what you want

00:01:55.230 --> 00:01:58.000 
a good way to do it that's what you want
to<00:01:55.290> do<00:01:55.410> is<00:01:55.620> once<00:01:56.340> you've<00:01:56.460> driven<00:01:56.640> it<00:01:56.820> around

00:01:58.000 --> 00:01:58.010 
to do is once you've driven it around

00:01:58.010 --> 00:02:00.680 
to do is once you've driven it around
we're<00:01:59.010> going<00:01:59.160> to<00:01:59.370> measure<00:02:00.300> the<00:02:00.510> tire

00:02:00.680 --> 00:02:00.690 
we're going to measure the tire

00:02:00.690 --> 00:02:01.750 
we're going to measure the tire
temperatures

00:02:01.750 --> 00:02:01.760 
temperatures

00:02:01.760 --> 00:02:03.700 
temperatures
andalasia<00:02:02.180> pyrometer<00:02:02.900> works<00:02:03.080> perfectly<00:02:03.500> for

00:02:03.700 --> 00:02:03.710 
andalasia pyrometer works perfectly for

00:02:03.710 --> 00:02:05.090 
andalasia pyrometer works perfectly for
that

00:02:05.090 --> 00:02:05.100 
that

00:02:05.100 --> 00:02:07.820 
that
so<00:02:05.550> you'll<00:02:05.730> measure<00:02:05.880> the<00:02:06.060> center<00:02:06.440> inside<00:02:07.440> on

00:02:07.820 --> 00:02:07.830 
so you'll measure the center inside on

00:02:07.830 --> 00:02:10.010 
so you'll measure the center inside on
the<00:02:07.979> outside<00:02:08.340> and<00:02:09.090> what<00:02:09.270> you<00:02:09.360> want<00:02:09.600> is<00:02:09.869> the

00:02:10.010 --> 00:02:10.020 
the outside and what you want is the

00:02:10.020 --> 00:02:12.260 
the outside and what you want is the
exact<00:02:10.289> same<00:02:10.470> temperature<00:02:10.710> across<00:02:11.190> all<00:02:11.910> three

00:02:12.260 --> 00:02:12.270 
exact same temperature across all three

00:02:12.270 --> 00:02:14.210 
exact same temperature across all three
areas<00:02:12.390> that<00:02:12.810> means<00:02:13.410> that<00:02:13.530> the<00:02:13.620> contact<00:02:14.040> patch

00:02:14.210 --> 00:02:14.220 
areas that means that the contact patch

00:02:14.220 --> 00:02:17.500 
areas that means that the contact patch
on<00:02:14.459> the<00:02:14.550> ground<00:02:14.820> is<00:02:15.560> equal<00:02:16.560> across<00:02:17.010> the<00:02:17.280> tire

00:02:17.500 --> 00:02:17.510 
on the ground is equal across the tire

00:02:17.510 --> 00:02:20.480 
on the ground is equal across the tire
the<00:02:18.510> outside<00:02:19.110> both<00:02:19.500> outsides<00:02:19.920> are<00:02:20.070> warm<00:02:20.370> in

00:02:20.480 --> 00:02:20.490 
the outside both outsides are warm in

00:02:20.490 --> 00:02:22.160 
the outside both outsides are warm in
the<00:02:20.580> cold<00:02:20.610> for<00:02:21.060> the<00:02:21.150> the<00:02:21.390> inside<00:02:21.690> is<00:02:21.840> cooler

00:02:22.160 --> 00:02:22.170 
the cold for the the inside is cooler

00:02:22.170 --> 00:02:24.380 
the cold for the the inside is cooler
now<00:02:22.980> that<00:02:23.190> means<00:02:23.310> you<00:02:23.430> more<00:02:23.730> likely<00:02:24.090> got<00:02:24.209> them

00:02:24.380 --> 00:02:24.390 
now that means you more likely got them

00:02:24.390 --> 00:02:26.570 
now that means you more likely got them
under<00:02:24.600> inflated<00:02:25.200> if<00:02:25.500> the<00:02:25.620> inside<00:02:25.980> is<00:02:26.130> warm<00:02:26.400> in

00:02:26.570 --> 00:02:26.580 
under inflated if the inside is warm in

00:02:26.580 --> 00:02:28.670 
under inflated if the inside is warm in
the<00:02:26.670> outsiders<00:02:27.209> cooler<00:02:27.450> or<00:02:27.810> outside<00:02:28.500> your

00:02:28.670 --> 00:02:28.680 
the outsiders cooler or outside your

the outsiders cooler or outside your
cooler<00:02:28.980> that<00:02:29.910> means<00:02:30.150> that<00:02:30.390> you<00:02:30.510> you're

00:02:30.949 --> 00:02:30.959 
cooler that means that you you're

00:02:30.959 --> 00:02:32.930 
cooler that means that you you're
overinflated<00:02:31.680> so<00:02:32.220> once<00:02:32.370> you<00:02:32.459> get<00:02:32.550> them<00:02:32.730> all

00:02:32.930 --> 00:02:32.940 
overinflated so once you get them all

00:02:32.940 --> 00:02:35.000

all<00:02:33.270> three<00:02:33.630> areas<00:02:34.020> to<00:02:34.050> give<00:02:34.350> basically<00:02:34.890> the

all three areas to give basically the

00:02:35.010 --> 00:02:37.280 
all three areas to give basically the
same<00:02:35.220> temperature<00:02:35.910> once<00:02:36.510> you've<00:02:36.660> tested<00:02:36.930> them

00:02:37.280 --> 00:02:37.290 
same temperature once you've tested them

00:02:37.290 --> 00:02:39.760 
same temperature once you've tested them
and<00:02:37.500> you<00:02:37.920> know<00:02:38.070> you're<00:02:38.220> pretty<00:02:38.370> much<00:02:38.580> dead<00:02:38.940> on

00:02:39.760 --> 00:02:39.770 
and you know you're pretty much dead on

00:02:39.770 --> 00:02:42.020
