00:01:28.619 --> 00:01:32.780 
what it looks like when you take it out
and<00:01:29.689> actually<00:01:30.689> I<00:01:30.720> think<00:01:30.810> I<00:01:31.110> left<00:01:31.320> the<00:01:31.790> this

00:01:32.780 --> 00:01:32.790 
and actually I think I left the this

00:01:32.790 --> 00:01:34.460 
and actually I think I left the this
thing<00:01:33.000> is<00:01:33.210> the<00:01:33.689> manual<00:01:34.079> and<00:01:34.170> that's<00:01:34.290> actually

00:01:36.980 --> 00:01:36.990 
underneath as well so the first thing

00:01:36.990 --> 00:01:39.859 
underneath as well so the first thing
you<00:01:37.110> see<00:01:37.320> is<00:01:37.790> the<00:01:38.790> product<00:01:39.360> and<00:01:39.509> this<00:01:39.600> is<00:01:39.659> what

little<00:01:58.829> settings<00:01:59.100> at<00:01:59.219> the<00:01:59.310> top<00:01:59.659> setting

00:02:00.649 --> 00:02:00.659 
little settings at the top setting

00:02:00.659 --> 00:02:03.260

review<00:02:06.630> -<00:02:06.780> since<00:02:07.020> I've<00:02:07.140> already<00:02:07.170> tried<00:02:07.530> it

00:02:07.550 --> 00:02:07.560 
review - since I've already tried it

00:02:07.560 --> 00:02:09.940 
review - since I've already tried it
since<00:02:07.890> my<00:02:08.009> roommate<00:02:08.310> also<00:02:08.459> got<00:02:08.759> one<00:02:08.879> and

00:02:09.940 --> 00:02:09.950 
since my roommate also got one and

00:02:09.950 --> 00:02:12.770 
since my roommate also got one and
number<00:02:10.950> two<00:02:11.099> is<00:02:11.430> really<00:02:11.730> really<00:02:12.239> hot<00:02:12.450> and<00:02:12.599> this

00:02:12.770 --> 00:02:12.780 
number two is really really hot and this

00:02:12.780 --> 00:02:13.290 
number two is really really hot and this
actually

00:02:13.290 --> 00:02:13.300 
actually

00:02:13.300 --> 00:02:16.230 
actually
heats<00:02:13.780> up<00:02:14.020> pretty<00:02:14.080> quickly<00:02:14.740> and<00:02:15.130> if<00:02:16.090> you

00:02:16.230 --> 00:02:16.240 
heats up pretty quickly and if you

00:02:16.240 --> 00:02:19.500 
heats up pretty quickly and if you
charge<00:02:16.570> it<00:02:16.750> a<00:02:16.900> one<00:02:17.590> charge<00:02:17.890> I<00:02:18.100> think<00:02:18.240> will<00:02:19.240> last

00:02:19.500 --> 00:02:19.510 
charge it a one charge I think will last

00:02:19.510 --> 00:02:21.600 
charge it a one charge I think will last
for<00:02:19.930> about<00:02:20.200> four<00:02:20.590> hours<00:02:20.620> on<00:02:20.950> the<00:02:21.190> medium

00:02:21.600 --> 00:02:21.610 
for about four hours on the medium

00:02:21.610 --> 00:02:24.450 
for about four hours on the medium
setting<00:02:21.940> so<00:02:22.660> it's<00:02:23.170> a<00:02:23.230> pretty<00:02:23.410> nice<00:02:23.620> longevity

00:02:24.450 --> 00:02:24.460 
setting so it's a pretty nice longevity

charging<00:02:55.720> it's<00:02:56.410> really<00:02:56.590> simple<00:02:56.830> it<00:02:57.010> doesn't

00:02:57.120 --> 00:02:57.130 
charging it's really simple it doesn't

00:02:57.130 --> 00:02:59.160 
charging it's really simple it doesn't
take<00:02:57.310> too<00:02:57.430> long<00:02:57.520> to<00:02:57.580> charge<00:02:57.820> it<00:02:58.000> all<00:02:58.090> and<00:02:58.330> then

00:02:59.160 --> 00:02:59.170 
take too long to charge it all and then

00:02:59.170 --> 00:03:03.000 
take too long to charge it all and then
this<00:02:59.410> is<00:03:00.390> the<00:03:01.390> thing<00:03:02.170> that<00:03:02.200> attaches<00:03:02.620> to<00:03:02.800> this

00:03:03.000 --> 00:03:03.010 
this is the thing that attaches to this

00:03:03.010 --> 00:03:04.620 
this is the thing that attaches to this
and<00:03:03.280> then<00:03:03.490> a<00:03:03.520> converter<00:03:03.910> so<00:03:04.150> that<00:03:04.300> you<00:03:04.390> can

00:03:04.620 --> 00:03:04.630 
and then a converter so that you can

00:03:04.630 --> 00:03:07.080 
and then a converter so that you can
charge<00:03:05.020> it<00:03:05.230> with<00:03:06.100> pretty<00:03:06.280> much<00:03:06.490> anything<00:03:06.760> and

00:03:07.080 --> 00:03:07.090 
charge it with pretty much anything and

00:03:07.090 --> 00:03:08.850 
charge it with pretty much anything and
these<00:03:07.690> are<00:03:07.870> the<00:03:07.960> little<00:03:08.110> heads<00:03:08.410> that<00:03:08.620> you<00:03:08.710> get

00:03:08.850 --> 00:03:08.860 
these are the little heads that you get

00:03:08.860 --> 00:03:10.740 
these are the little heads that you get

00:03:35.420 --> 00:03:35.430 
that's what I mean pretty much it so

00:03:35.430 --> 00:03:37.860 
that's what I mean pretty much it so
let's<00:03:36.430> look<00:03:36.520> at<00:03:36.640> the<00:03:36.760> manual<00:03:37.209> real<00:03:37.390> quick<00:03:37.570> I'm

00:03:37.860 --> 00:03:37.870 
let's look at the manual real quick I'm

00:03:37.870 --> 00:03:38.970 
let's look at the manual real quick I'm
sure<00:03:38.140> there's<00:03:38.290> some<00:03:38.410> frequently<00:03:38.800> asked

00:03:38.970 --> 00:03:38.980 
sure there's some frequently asked

00:03:38.980 --> 00:03:41.490 
sure there's some frequently asked
questions<00:03:39.100> in<00:03:39.550> here<00:03:40.050> so<00:03:41.050> the<00:03:41.320> high

00:03:41.490 --> 00:03:41.500 
questions in here so the high

00:03:41.500 --> 00:03:45.800 
questions in here so the high
temperature<00:03:42.040> is<00:03:43.080> actually<00:03:44.080> let<00:03:44.950> me<00:03:45.040> find<00:03:45.340> it

00:03:45.800 --> 00:03:45.810 
temperature is actually let me find it

00:03:45.810 --> 00:03:47.970 
temperature is actually let me find it
the<00:03:46.810> high<00:03:46.959> temperature<00:03:47.410> is<00:03:47.500> actually<00:03:47.680> about

00:03:47.970 --> 00:03:47.980 
the high temperature is actually about

00:03:47.980 --> 00:03:50.729 
the high temperature is actually about
120<00:03:48.880> degrees<00:03:49.000> Fahrenheit<00:03:49.630> or<00:03:49.660> 49<00:03:50.170> Celsius<00:03:50.620> and

00:03:50.729 --> 00:03:50.739 
120 degrees Fahrenheit or 49 Celsius and

00:03:50.739 --> 00:03:52.800 
120 degrees Fahrenheit or 49 Celsius and
the<00:03:51.280> low<00:03:51.430> temperature<00:03:51.880> which<00:03:52.060> is<00:03:52.209> setting<00:03:52.600> one

00:03:52.800 --> 00:03:52.810 
the low temperature which is setting one

00:03:52.810 --> 00:03:56.370 
the low temperature which is setting one
is<00:03:53.020> 109<00:03:53.980> Fahrenheit<00:03:54.520> in<00:03:54.610> 43<00:03:55.030> Celsius<00:03:55.510> and<00:03:55.690> the

00:03:56.370 --> 00:03:56.380 
is 109 Fahrenheit in 43 Celsius and the

00:03:56.380 --> 00:03:58.800 
is 109 Fahrenheit in 43 Celsius and the
average<00:03:56.650> temperature<00:03:56.920> is<00:03:57.489> more<00:03:58.390> or<00:03:58.480> less<00:03:58.630> than

00:03:58.800 --> 00:03:58.810 
average temperature is more or less than

00:03:58.810 --> 00:04:01.310 
average temperature is more or less than
that<00:03:58.840> it's<00:03:59.140> pretty<00:03:59.500> awesome<00:03:59.860> and<00:04:00.459> pretty

00:04:01.310 --> 00:04:01.320 
that it's pretty awesome and pretty

00:04:01.320 --> 00:04:07.260 
that it's pretty awesome and pretty
straightforward<00:04:02.320> there<00:04:05.370> they<00:04:06.370> say<00:04:06.610> to<00:04:06.670> charge

00:04:07.260 --> 00:04:07.270 
straightforward there they say to charge

00:04:07.270 --> 00:04:09.180 
straightforward there they say to charge
it<00:04:07.480> before<00:04:08.020> you<00:04:08.320> use<00:04:08.620> it<00:04:08.770> the<00:04:08.860> first<00:04:08.890> time

00:04:09.180 --> 00:04:09.190 
it before you use it the first time

00:04:09.190 --> 00:04:11.370 
it before you use it the first time
after<00:04:09.430> you<00:04:09.610> get<00:04:09.760> it<00:04:09.880> I<00:04:09.970> did<00:04:10.150> that<00:04:10.330> and<00:04:10.750> it<00:04:11.290> was

00:04:11.370 --> 00:04:11.380 
after you get it I did that and it was

00:04:11.380 --> 00:04:12.660 
after you get it I did that and it was
pretty<00:04:11.560> much<00:04:11.620> already<00:04:11.860> charged<00:04:12.340> but<00:04:12.489> I<00:04:12.519> think

00:04:12.660 --> 00:04:12.670 
pretty much already charged but I think

00:04:12.670 --> 00:04:13.890 
pretty much already charged but I think
it's<00:04:12.790> just<00:04:12.910> a<00:04:12.970> precaution<00:04:13.150> so<00:04:13.600> you<00:04:13.660> don't<00:04:13.810> like

00:04:13.890 --> 00:04:13.900 
it's just a precaution so you don't like

00:04:13.900 --> 00:04:15.210 
it's just a precaution so you don't like
