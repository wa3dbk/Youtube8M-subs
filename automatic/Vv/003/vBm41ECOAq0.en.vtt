00:01:51.630 --> 00:01:53.600 
the best to use but it can handle is
quite<00:01:51.900> well<00:01:52.080> and<00:01:52.260> still<00:01:52.500> dual-core<00:01:53.070> device<00:01:53.370> so

00:01:53.600 --> 00:01:53.610 
quite well and still dual-core device so

00:01:53.610 --> 00:01:55.520 
quite well and still dual-core device so
i'm<00:01:53.729> just<00:01:53.760> guessing<00:01:54.090> on<00:01:54.420> a<00:01:54.450> five<00:01:54.870> devices<00:01:55.200> it

00:01:55.520 --> 00:01:55.530

00:04:07.830 --> 00:04:07.840 
game like using a different path like

00:04:07.840 --> 00:04:10.560 
game like using a different path like
crap<00:04:08.380> faithful<00:04:09.280> or<00:04:09.430> even<00:04:09.760> the<00:04:09.940> shares<00:04:10.209> texture

00:04:10.560 --> 00:04:10.570 
crap faithful or even the shares texture

00:04:10.570 --> 00:04:12.600 
crap faithful or even the shares texture
pack<00:04:10.720> itself<00:04:11.110> just<00:04:11.530> some<00:04:11.770> mod<00:04:12.130> will<00:04:12.370> actually

00:04:12.600 --> 00:04:12.610 
pack itself just some mod will actually

00:04:12.610 --> 00:04:14.460 
pack itself just some mod will actually
correlate<00:04:13.030> to<00:04:13.060> that<00:04:13.360> and<00:04:13.660> will<00:04:14.260> work

00:04:14.460 --> 00:04:14.470 
correlate to that and will work

00:04:14.470 --> 00:04:16.349
