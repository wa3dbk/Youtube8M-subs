mice to a certain smell and then

mice to a certain smell and then
startling<00:00:57.629> them<00:00:57.840> that<00:00:58.170> those<00:00:58.410> mices

offspring would have an aversion to that
same<00:01:00.899> smell<00:01:01.320> and<00:01:01.649> then<00:01:02.160> those<00:01:02.520> mice<00:01:02.879> as

00:01:03.080 --> 00:01:03.090 
same smell and then those mice as

00:01:03.090 --> 00:01:04.670 
same smell and then those mice as
offspring<00:01:03.570> would<00:01:03.750> still<00:01:04.049> have<00:01:04.290> an<00:01:04.409> aversion

00:01:04.670 --> 00:01:04.680

00:01:09.230 --> 00:01:09.240 
to that same smell how does that work in

00:01:09.240 --> 00:01:11.270 
to that same smell how does that work in
the<00:01:09.450> paper<00:01:09.659> they<00:01:10.110> talk<00:01:10.320> about<00:01:10.500> methylation

the paper they talk about methylation

00:01:11.280 --> 00:01:13.460 
the paper they talk about methylation
basically<00:01:11.880> a<00:01:12.150> little<00:01:12.420> organic<00:01:12.840> molecule

turning that gene on in the paper these

00:01:20.640 --> 00:01:22.490 
turning that gene on in the paper these
methyl<00:01:21.090> groups<00:01:21.119> were<00:01:21.540> getting<00:01:21.869> removed<00:01:22.229> from

00:01:22.490 --> 00:01:22.500 
methyl groups were getting removed from

methyl groups were getting removed from
gains<00:01:22.830> that<00:01:23.159> deal<00:01:23.400> with<00:01:23.640> the<00:01:23.759> detection<00:01:24.119> of

gains that deal with the detection of
smell<00:01:24.720> in<00:01:24.960> the<00:01:25.080> brain<00:01:25.290> this<00:01:25.619> was<00:01:25.830> also

00:01:26.179 --> 00:01:26.189 
smell in the brain this was also

00:01:26.189 --> 00:01:28.190 
smell in the brain this was also
happening<00:01:26.430> in<00:01:26.729> the<00:01:26.820> dad's<00:01:27.030> sperm<00:01:27.420> which<00:01:27.990> meant

00:01:28.190 --> 00:01:28.200 
happening in the dad's sperm which meant

00:01:28.200 --> 00:01:30.050 
happening in the dad's sperm which meant
his<00:01:28.320> offspring<00:01:28.920> would<00:01:29.070> express<00:01:29.460> more<00:01:29.759> of<00:01:29.909> that

00:01:30.050 --> 00:01:30.060 
his offspring would express more of that

00:01:30.060 --> 00:01:31.310 
his offspring would express more of that
gene<00:01:30.360> which<00:01:30.780> would<00:01:30.930> make<00:01:31.079> them<00:01:31.290> more

00:01:31.310 --> 00:01:31.320 
gene which would make them more

00:01:31.320 --> 00:01:33.350 
gene which would make them more
sensitive<00:01:31.770> and<00:01:32.250> react<00:01:32.579> stronger<00:01:33.119> to<00:01:33.329> the

00:01:33.350 --> 00:01:33.360 
sensitive and react stronger to the

00:01:33.360 --> 00:01:35.840 
sensitive and react stronger to the
smell<00:01:33.689> but<00:01:34.200> like<00:01:34.380> how<00:01:35.220> does<00:01:35.430> his<00:01:35.549> brain

00:01:35.840 --> 00:01:35.850 
smell but like how does his brain

00:01:35.850 --> 00:01:38.090 
smell but like how does his brain
getting<00:01:36.180> scared<00:01:36.540> change<00:01:36.840> up<00:01:36.930> his<00:01:37.049> sperm<00:01:37.500> we

00:01:38.090 --> 00:01:38.100 
getting scared change up his sperm we

00:01:38.100 --> 00:01:40.039 
getting scared change up his sperm we
don't<00:01:38.310> know<00:01:38.520> exactly<00:01:38.729> but<00:01:39.299> we<00:01:39.540> do<00:01:39.750> know<00:01:39.930> it

00:01:40.039 --> 00:01:40.049

00:01:50.960 --> 00:01:50.970 
that maybe the chemicals of the smell

00:01:50.970 --> 00:01:52.760 
that maybe the chemicals of the smell
are<00:01:51.210> getting<00:01:51.600> into<00:01:51.869> the<00:01:51.990> bloodstream<00:01:52.229> and

are getting into the bloodstream and

00:01:52.770 --> 00:01:55.130 
are getting into the bloodstream and
somehow<00:01:53.040> affecting<00:01:53.700> the<00:01:53.820> dads<00:01:54.030> sperm<00:01:54.420> which

00:01:55.130 --> 00:01:55.140

00:01:55.140 --> 00:01:57.170 
somehow affecting the dads sperm which
eventually<00:01:55.470> affected<00:01:56.250> the<00:01:56.369> offspring<00:01:56.880> they

00:01:57.170 --> 00:01:57.180 
eventually affected the offspring they

00:01:57.180 --> 00:01:59.389 
eventually affected the offspring they
tested<00:01:57.689> three<00:01:57.990> generations<00:01:58.649> to<00:01:58.890> prove<00:01:59.159> that

00:01:59.389 --> 00:01:59.399 
tested three generations to prove that

00:01:59.399 --> 00:02:01.490 
tested three generations to prove that
it<00:01:59.549> was<00:01:59.670> the<00:01:59.820> genetic<00:02:00.030> not<00:02:00.780> the<00:02:00.990> chemical

00:02:01.490 --> 00:02:01.500 
it was the genetic not the chemical

00:02:01.500 --> 00:02:03.319 
it was the genetic not the chemical
effect<00:02:01.920> that<00:02:02.399> was<00:02:02.579> changing<00:02:03.000> the<00:02:03.149> mouse

00:02:03.319 --> 00:02:03.329 
effect that was changing the mouse

00:02:03.329 --> 00:02:05.690 
effect that was changing the mouse
behavior<00:02:03.869> so<00:02:04.229> more<00:02:04.530> experimentation<00:02:05.340> is

00:02:05.690 --> 00:02:05.700 
behavior so more experimentation is

00:02:05.700 --> 00:02:08.960 
behavior so more experimentation is
needed<00:02:06.210> exactly<00:02:06.680> for<00:02:07.680> Assassin's<00:02:08.429> Creed<00:02:08.759> is

00:02:08.960 --> 00:02:08.970 
needed exactly for Assassin's Creed is

00:02:08.970 --> 00:02:11.229 
needed exactly for Assassin's Creed is
real

00:02:11.229 --> 00:02:11.239 
real

00:02:11.239 --> 00:02:14.270 
real
yes<00:02:12.239> it's<00:02:12.870> important<00:02:13.379> to<00:02:13.470> note<00:02:13.680> that<00:02:13.920> because

00:02:14.270 --> 00:02:14.280 
yes it's important to note that because

00:02:14.280 --> 00:02:16.220 
yes it's important to note that because
sperm<00:02:14.700> is<00:02:14.879> constantly<00:02:15.450> regenerating<00:02:16.049> in

00:02:16.220 --> 00:02:16.230 
sperm is constantly regenerating in

00:02:16.230 --> 00:02:17.929 
sperm is constantly regenerating in
males<00:02:16.439> it's<00:02:16.799> only<00:02:17.010> the<00:02:17.220> male<00:02:17.430> mice<00:02:17.700> that

00:02:17.929 --> 00:02:17.939 
males it's only the male mice that

00:02:17.939 --> 00:02:21.319 
males it's only the male mice that
passed<00:02:18.180> on<00:02:18.329> the<00:02:18.480> effects<00:02:19.010> so<00:02:20.010> if<00:02:20.189> you<00:02:20.489> by<00:02:21.030> some

00:02:21.319 --> 00:02:21.329 
passed on the effects so if you by some

00:02:21.329 --> 00:02:23.360 
passed on the effects so if you by some
miracle<00:02:21.599> have<00:02:22.260> children<00:02:22.739> one<00:02:22.950> day<00:02:22.980> and

00:02:23.360 --> 00:02:23.370 
miracle have children one day and

00:02:23.370 --> 00:02:25.699 
miracle have children one day and
they're<00:02:23.730> a<00:02:23.760> little<00:02:24.150> weird<00:02:24.720> from<00:02:24.959> the<00:02:25.079> get-go

00:02:25.699 --> 00:02:25.709 
they're a little weird from the get-go

00:02:25.709 --> 00:02:27.530 
they're a little weird from the get-go
it<00:02:25.920> might<00:02:26.250> be<00:02:26.430> your<00:02:26.640> fault<00:02:26.940> well<00:02:27.329> I<00:02:27.360> guess

00:02:27.530 --> 00:02:27.540 
it might be your fault well I guess

00:02:27.540 --> 00:02:28.399 
it might be your fault well I guess
they're<00:02:27.659> not<00:02:27.750> going<00:02:27.930> to<00:02:27.989> be<00:02:28.049> learning<00:02:28.200> my

00:02:28.399 --> 00:02:28.409 
they're not going to be learning my

00:02:28.409 --> 00:02:36.190 
they're not going to be learning my
sweet<00:02:28.709> -<00:02:28.829> knife<00:02:29.010> skills

00:02:36.190 --> 00:02:36.200 

00:02:36.200 --> 00:02:45.409 

let's<00:02:37.200> do<00:02:37.349> for<00:02:37.590> you<00:02:42.409> interesting
