00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.220
 which is funny while some 

00:00:02.100 --> 00:00:08.130
 want and do not want compromised names 

00:00:05.220 --> 00:00:10.710
 You have a person asking has chance 

00:00:08.130 --> 00:00:12.840
 with the man committed to maintaining 

00:00:10.710 --> 00:00:16.199
 interested in me, I'm finding a way 

00:00:12.840 --> 00:00:18.720
 him because in order for him to value more 

00:00:16.199 --> 00:00:20.609
 is my right like his attitude 

00:00:18.720 --> 00:00:22.920
 but I want him to be more attentive 

00:00:20.609 --> 00:00:25.230
 Give me more value if you want. 

00:00:22.920 --> 00:00:27.510
 always close to conquering a man 

00:00:25.230 --> 00:00:29.789
 committed to maintaining not interested 

00:00:27.510 --> 00:00:33.859
 It's okay, because it's who I'm going to give you. 

00:00:29.789 --> 00:00:33.859
 more value 5 or a value signal 

00:00:39.770 --> 00:00:45.930
 because it 's more or less like you 

00:00:42.360 --> 00:00:48.450
 placed in the position of the other of the second 

00:00:45.930 --> 00:00:50.730
 option if we have already placed a position of 

00:00:48.450 --> 00:00:52.440
 second option or is not like you 

00:00:50.730 --> 00:00:54.870
 demands nothing with you was when you 

00:00:52.440 --> 00:00:57.590
 is in the second option you accepted 

00:00:54.870 --> 00:01:00.629
 that situation you knowingly 

00:00:57.590 --> 00:01:01.920
 knows that he is committed and accepted 

00:01:00.629 --> 00:01:04.470
 that situation 

00:01:01.920 --> 00:01:06.960
 a chance with him is difficult because he 

00:01:04.470 --> 00:01:09.450
 has official officer probably not 

00:01:06.960 --> 00:01:12.260
 does and would not do what you're doing 

00:01:09.450 --> 00:01:16.799
 would not be in this situation of 

00:01:12.260 --> 00:01:20.790
 maybe want brown relationship 

00:01:16.799 --> 00:01:23.299
 want to take more time from him is 

00:01:20.790 --> 00:01:30.900
 speaking here is not with interested butter 

00:01:23.299 --> 00:01:32.400
 for leaving and you want to keep 

00:01:30.900 --> 00:01:33.240
 a committed man interested already 

00:01:32.400 --> 00:01:36.479
 thought about it 

00:01:33.240 --> 00:01:38.520
 Maybe you need your breast and if 

00:01:36.479 --> 00:01:40.079
 maybe add more value to something 

00:01:38.520 --> 00:01:42.150
 Not so much in your life. 

00:01:40.079 --> 00:01:47.009
 behavior needs to be changed 

00:01:42.150 --> 00:01:49.860
 if you're giving yourself up by putting yourself 

00:01:47.009 --> 00:01:52.049
 second option consciously some 

00:01:49.860 --> 00:01:57.240
 thing of wrong sata that you deserve 

00:01:52.049 --> 00:01:59.369
 more fixed up a aa aa girlfriend wife 

00:01:57.240 --> 00:02:01.439
 this person also deserves more risk of 

00:01:59.369 --> 00:02:03.450
 that a guy who wants to keep both 

00:02:01.439 --> 00:02:06.570
 this part the guy is something you can 

00:02:03.450 --> 00:02:09.479
 change yourself if you can change you 

00:02:06.570 --> 00:02:11.280
 even change their situation because they 

00:02:09.479 --> 00:02:13.310
 attracts someone who really pays off 

00:02:11.280 --> 00:02:15.800
 someone who 

00:02:13.310 --> 00:02:17.750
 would be the second option at first 

00:02:15.800 --> 00:02:20.450
 place is not treated as a second option 

00:02:17.750 --> 00:02:23.060
 if not human 

00:02:20.450 --> 00:02:27.860
 the idea is you love yourself first 

00:02:23.060 --> 00:02:30.380
 because keeping a person engaged 

00:02:27.860 --> 00:02:32.690
 focusing on you there you not only will 

00:02:30.380 --> 00:02:35.989
 being delayed as destroying a 

00:02:32.690 --> 00:02:38.840
 other family is noir problem nor is this 

00:02:35.989 --> 00:02:40.519
 Did you realize that you said ah? 

00:02:38.840 --> 00:02:43.390
 he be more attentive, give me more 

00:02:40.519 --> 00:02:46.220
 value that always wants me around 

00:02:43.390 --> 00:02:48.019
 you are wrong 

00:02:46.220 --> 00:02:49.340
 how does a guy committed but this 

00:02:48.019 --> 00:02:52.459
 will always be around 

00:02:49.340 --> 00:02:54.049
 Have you thought about if you want the wrong things? 

00:02:52.459 --> 00:02:56.959

00:02:54.049 --> 00:03:02.780
 wrong you are already a part of the principle 

00:02:56.959 --> 00:03:05.390
 that it 's all wrong for you it's a 

00:03:02.780 --> 00:03:06.860
 person really all 

00:03:05.390 --> 00:03:08.930
 women who are putting in 

00:03:06.860 --> 00:03:12.080
 placing as a second option in the 

00:03:08.930 --> 00:03:14.450
 life will change 

00:03:12.080 --> 00:03:17.239
 how do you see the relationship the 

00:03:14.450 --> 00:03:18.170
 partners men committed you 

00:03:17.239 --> 00:03:22.010
