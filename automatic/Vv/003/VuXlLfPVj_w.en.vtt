00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.529
 hello to you andrew andreevich my 

00:00:01.949 --> 00:00:07.490
 YouTube channel all-all ru and we decide 

00:00:04.529 --> 00:00:10.679
 task number 246 

00:00:07.490 --> 00:00:13.950
 what part of the hour is forty five 

00:00:10.679 --> 00:00:16.770
 minutes twelve minutes 15-40 minutes and 

00:00:13.950 --> 00:00:19.020
 thirty seven thirty five minutes where 

00:00:16.770 --> 00:00:25.830
 very beginning what part of the hour 

00:00:19.020 --> 00:00:28.070
 is 45 minutes 45 minutes and an hour 

00:00:25.830 --> 00:00:30.330
 parts how many minutes in an hour 60 minutes 

00:00:28.070 --> 00:00:33.480
 to find out what part of the make up 

00:00:30.330 --> 00:00:36.350
 forty five minutes from a full hour you need 

00:00:33.480 --> 00:00:39.750
 45 divided on the subject often 6 minutes 

00:00:36.350 --> 00:00:42.750
 next you just need to reduce our fraction 

00:00:39.750 --> 00:00:46.260
 but for starters let's reduce it to 545 

00:00:42.750 --> 00:00:51.510
 divided by 5 will be 960 divided by 5 

00:00:46.260 --> 00:00:57.660
 will be 12 well and we will reduce to 3 nine 

00:00:51.510 --> 00:01:01.649
 divide by 3 312 divide by 3 4 3 4 hours 

00:00:57.660 --> 00:01:06.439
 makes 45 minutes well and further 

00:01:01.649 --> 00:01:12.030
 in the same way 12 minutes 12.6 

00:01:06.439 --> 00:01:14.280
 12 minutes from an hour is 12.6 let's 

00:01:12.030 --> 00:01:17.340
 we can reduce a little we can divide by 6 

00:01:14.280 --> 00:01:21.390
 top bottom top divide by 6 is 2 

00:01:17.340 --> 00:01:23.400
 bottom divided by 6 will be 10 further now 

00:01:21.390 --> 00:01:25.350
 2 divided by the top 2 divided and 

00:01:23.400 --> 00:01:26.880
 bottom section 2, we must 

00:01:25.350 --> 00:01:35.240
 divide from top to bottom 

00:01:26.880 --> 00:01:35.240
 number oh why 20 is written 5 

00:01:36.060 --> 00:01:45.090
 Of course 2 divide by 2 is one ten 

00:01:39.850 --> 00:01:45.090
 at stage 2 on 

00:01:46.800 --> 00:01:53.520
 15 minutes 15 minutes from the hour is 

00:01:51.540 --> 00:02:00.040
 15.6 

00:01:53.520 --> 00:02:07.510
 if we reduce them by 5 there will be 312 them, and if 

00:02:00.040 --> 00:02:11.440
 once again reduce sodium will 1 4 more 

00:02:07.510 --> 00:02:14.980
 they offer us 40 minutes forty minutes from 

00:02:11.440 --> 00:02:16.720
 hours some part divided by 10 

00:02:14.980 --> 00:02:18.880
 It turns out 4 6 

00:02:16.720 --> 00:02:21.670
 top 10 divide if the market and sat 

00:02:18.880 --> 00:02:23.110
 on the same number and necessarily 2 

00:02:21.670 --> 00:02:24.310
 we can still cut and on top of 2 

00:02:23.110 --> 00:02:26.890
 cut it will be two 

00:02:24.310 --> 00:02:30.780
 reduced to reduce turns 3 we 

00:02:26.890 --> 00:02:35.920
 divide from above reduced by 2 two thirds 

00:02:30.780 --> 00:02:41.080
 and yet we left 35 minutes 35 minutes 

00:02:35.920 --> 00:02:43.720
 from the hour we can cut by 5 on top 

00:02:41.080 --> 00:02:48.340
 divide by 5 get 7 and divide from below by 

00:02:43.720 --> 00:02:52.260
 5 turns 12 712 Well then have no way 

00:02:48.340 --> 00:02:53.980
 we will not reduce therefore we will leave as is 

00:02:52.260 --> 00:02:56.230
 that's all 

00:02:53.980 --> 00:02:57.480
