00:00:45.346 --> 00:00:51.012
"The Serreta, a poor and remote village in Terceira Island, Azores.
It's a land of mystery constantly swept

00:00:51.013 --> 00:00:56.679
by wild winds and fog. Many of the unexplained
cases that there took place were narrated

00:00:56.780 --> 00:01:02.446
to me, but mostly these stories died with
the last elderly that lived or heard of them."

00:01:19.953 --> 00:01:21.953
&gt;&gt; Mom:  Joana dinner is ready!

00:01:22.593 --> 00:01:24.628
&gt;&gt; Joana: Coming mom!

00:01:24.663 --> 00:01:28.960
&gt;&gt; Mom:  Sit here and let's eat the soup.

00:01:36.490 --> 00:01:39.185
&gt;&gt; Joana: - Mom could you tell me a story.
&gt;&gt; Mom: - Ok. Mommy will tell you a story.

00:01:39.767 --> 00:01:49.041
&gt;&gt; Mom: Once upon a time there was a boy who didn't want
to eat his soup, so he ran away to the Serreta woods.

00:01:49.919 --> 00:01:51.919
&gt;&gt; Joana: Was he a little boy?

00:01:51.920 --> 00:01:56.807
&gt;&gt; Mom: Yes Joana, he was a little boy.
Now can I finish the story?

00:01:57.336 --> 00:02:01.647
He was playing in the woods and started to get...
&gt;&gt; Joana: Mommy?

00:02:01.648 --> 00:02:05.140
&gt;&gt; Mom: - Yes Joana?
&gt;&gt; Joana: - How did he get there?

00:02:06.935 --> 00:02:11.028
&gt;&gt; Mom: - Err... He drove there!?
&gt;&gt; Joana: - All by him self?

00:02:11.029 --> 00:02:14.539
&gt;&gt; Mom: Err... He was a rascal so he stole his parents car.

00:02:15.409 --> 00:02:22.481
&gt;&gt; Mom: Where was I? Ah! João was playing in the woods
then it started to get really cold.

00:02:23.179 --> 00:02:25.848
&gt;&gt; Mom: He had no way to go back home...
&gt;&gt; Joana: What about the car?

00:02:25.849 --> 00:02:27.567
&gt;&gt; Mom: Ran out of gas!

00:02:31.648 --> 00:02:35.777
Since João had no way to go back home
he started looking for shelter in the forest.

00:02:37.977 --> 00:02:41.598
While he was searching he heard someone calling his name.

00:02:45.272 --> 00:02:47.926
It seemed like the voice was coming from deep into the woods.

00:02:52.355 --> 00:02:54.892
The boy moves in the direction of the voice...

00:02:54.893 --> 00:02:58.849
As he approaches, the voice gets louder...

00:03:01.275 --> 00:03:05.043
Tired, eventually finds an abandoned house...

00:03:06.929 --> 00:03:09.567
It seemed like the voice was coming from inside.

00:03:17.061 --> 00:03:18.359
&gt;&gt; João: Who's there?

00:03:23.655 --> 00:03:27.655
&gt;&gt; Balbina: - Hello! What are you doing around here?
&gt;&gt; João: - I ran away because I didn't want to eat soup.

00:03:27.656 --> 00:03:34.985
&gt;&gt; Balbina: - Don't you think that's a little drastic of you?
&gt;&gt; João: - You have no idea what's like to eat the same thing everyday.

00:03:36.860 --> 00:03:41.297
&gt;&gt; Balbina: - Yes, I do. I've been eating the same
thing for the last six hundred... I mean twenty years!

00:03:42.133 --> 00:03:44.918
So what are you doing here? How did you get here?

00:03:45.425 --> 00:03:48.872
&gt;&gt; João: - I stole my parents car.
&gt;&gt; Balbina: - Aren't you a little young to be driving?

00:03:49.217 --> 00:03:54.240
&gt;&gt; João: Dude!... This is just a story people tell their
kids to get them to eat soup. Don't complicate this!

00:03:54.808 --> 00:03:58.047
&gt;&gt; Balbina: - Alright then. Come in and i'll tell you a story.

00:03:58.048 --> 00:04:02.355
&gt;&gt; João: - I better not. My parents
always tell me not to talk to strangers.

00:04:02.939 --> 00:04:09.529
&gt;&gt; Balbina: "I understand their concern but I'm not a stranger
and you will come in because I'm asking politely."

00:04:09.530 --> 00:04:12.043
&gt;&gt; João: "I'll come in because you're asking politely."

00:04:13.537 --> 00:04:21.497
&gt;&gt; Mom: João has never been seen ever since.
Some say that by night at Serreta you can still hear João screaming.

00:04:23.475 --> 00:04:25.828
&gt;&gt; Joana: I can eat all by myself!
