the equipment put it in one section and
let's<00:01:12.800> go<00:01:13.479> the<00:01:14.479> first<00:01:14.720> exercise<00:01:15.020> in<00:01:15.380> today's

00:01:15.609 --> 00:01:15.619 
let's go the first exercise in today's

00:01:15.619 --> 00:01:17.679 
let's go the first exercise in today's
workout<00:01:16.039> is<00:01:16.100> the<00:01:16.340> hanging<00:01:16.580> leg<00:01:16.850> raise<00:01:17.150> I'm

00:01:17.679 --> 00:01:17.689 
workout is the hanging leg raise I'm

00:01:17.689 --> 00:01:21.460 
workout is the hanging leg raise I'm
gonna<00:01:17.930> do<00:01:18.049> three<00:01:18.229> sets<00:01:18.650> of<00:01:18.830> 12<00:01:19.460> and<00:01:19.640> 15<00:01:20.470> I'll

00:01:21.460 --> 00:01:21.470 
gonna do three sets of 12 and 15 I'll

00:01:21.470 --> 00:01:22.870 
gonna do three sets of 12 and 15 I'll
start<00:01:21.770> there<00:01:21.920> being<00:01:22.100> the<00:01:22.189> first<00:01:22.369> exercise

00:01:22.870 --> 00:01:22.880 
start there being the first exercise

00:01:22.880 --> 00:01:24.670 
start there being the first exercise
because<00:01:23.240> it's<00:01:23.600> a<00:01:23.659> pretty<00:01:23.869> difficult<00:01:24.020> exercise

00:01:24.670 --> 00:01:24.680 
because it's a pretty difficult exercise

00:01:24.680 --> 00:01:26.499 
because it's a pretty difficult exercise
and<00:01:25.009> so<00:01:25.280> once<00:01:25.490> again<00:01:25.610> back<00:01:25.880> to<00:01:25.909> my<00:01:26.030> theory<00:01:26.390> of

00:01:26.499 --> 00:01:26.509 
and so once again back to my theory of

00:01:26.509 --> 00:01:28.899 
and so once again back to my theory of
if<00:01:27.080> you<00:01:27.290> really<00:01:27.500> want<00:01:27.650> to<00:01:27.770> attack<00:01:28.610> a

00:01:28.899 --> 00:01:28.909 
if you really want to attack a

00:01:28.909 --> 00:01:31.390 
if you really want to attack a
particular<00:01:29.450> muscle<00:01:29.659> and<00:01:30.079> with<00:01:30.920> the<00:01:31.100> most

00:01:31.390 --> 00:01:31.400 
particular muscle and with the most

00:01:31.400 --> 00:01:32.830 
particular muscle and with the most
intensity<00:01:31.909> you<00:01:31.970> want<00:01:32.090> start<00:01:32.270> off<00:01:32.420> with<00:01:32.600> and

00:01:32.830 --> 00:01:32.840 
intensity you want start off with and

00:01:32.840 --> 00:01:34.719 
intensity you want start off with and
something<00:01:33.380> like<00:01:33.500> that<00:01:33.619> when<00:01:34.040> to<00:01:34.579> meet

00:01:34.719 --> 00:01:34.729 
something like that when to meet

00:01:34.729 --> 00:01:36.969 
something like that when to meet
benefits<00:01:35.270> the<00:01:35.420> most<00:01:35.630> and<00:01:35.990> and<00:01:36.439> depending<00:01:36.680> on

00:01:36.969 --> 00:01:36.979 
benefits the most and and depending on

00:01:36.979 --> 00:01:38.710 
benefits the most and and depending on
where<00:01:37.280> you<00:01:37.400> go<00:01:37.549> legs<00:01:37.759> out<00:01:37.970> or<00:01:38.119> knees<00:01:38.270> up<00:01:38.450> really

00:01:38.710 --> 00:01:38.720 
where you go legs out or knees up really

00:01:38.720 --> 00:01:40.539 
where you go legs out or knees up really

targets the whole abs you know you can

that same routine and you're hanging it

00:01:43.399 --> 00:01:44.560

it difficult I'm income I don't really
take<00:01:47.479> time<00:01:47.720> out<00:01:47.899> to<00:01:47.960> really<00:01:48.290> warm<00:01:48.560> up<00:01:48.680> abs<00:01:48.950> so

00:01:49.840 --> 00:01:49.850 
take time out to really warm up abs so

00:01:49.850 --> 00:01:51.850 
take time out to really warm up abs so
using<00:01:50.329> my<00:01:50.360> first<00:01:50.630> set<00:01:50.899> in<00:01:51.020> ABS<00:01:51.229> is<00:01:51.470> normally

00:01:51.850 --> 00:01:51.860 
using my first set in ABS is normally

00:01:51.860 --> 00:01:56.620 
using my first set in ABS is normally
doing<00:01:52.130> just<00:01:52.549> bodyweight<00:01:54.820> so<00:01:55.820> that's<00:01:56.270> my<00:01:56.450> first

00:01:56.620 --> 00:01:56.630

doing just bodyweight so that's my first
set<00:01:56.899> I<00:01:56.930> noticed<00:01:57.500> that<00:01:57.680> I<00:01:58.490> like<00:01:59.030> the<00:01:59.149> next<00:01:59.420> one<00:01:59.540> I

00:01:59.560 --> 00:01:59.570 
set I noticed that I like the next one I

00:01:59.570 --> 00:02:00.789 
set I noticed that I like the next one I
could<00:01:59.780> have<00:01:59.869> definitely<00:02:00.020> added<00:02:00.530> some<00:02:00.619> weight

00:02:00.789 --> 00:02:00.799 
could have definitely added some weight

00:02:00.799 --> 00:02:03.600 
could have definitely added some weight
to<00:02:01.009> it<00:02:01.159> and<00:02:01.280> I<00:02:01.610> did

00:02:03.600 --> 00:02:03.610 
to it and I did

00:02:03.610 --> 00:02:05.950 
to it and I did
the<00:02:04.610> most<00:02:04.790> important<00:02:05.180> point<00:02:05.420> to<00:02:05.570> remember<00:02:05.750> why

00:02:05.950 --> 00:02:05.960 
the most important point to remember why

00:02:05.960 --> 00:02:07.630 
the most important point to remember why
doing<00:02:06.200> this<00:02:06.260> exercise<00:02:06.770> to<00:02:07.040> keep<00:02:07.190> the<00:02:07.340> elbows

00:02:10.240 --> 00:02:10.250 
slightly bent to prevent sway also keep

00:02:10.250 --> 00:02:12.340 
slightly bent to prevent sway also keep
the<00:02:10.340> ABS<00:02:10.520> constricted<00:02:11.150> to<00:02:11.330> prevent<00:02:12.110> swaying

00:02:12.340 --> 00:02:12.350 
the ABS constricted to prevent swaying

00:02:12.350 --> 00:02:20.230 
the ABS constricted to prevent swaying
as<00:02:12.470> well<00:02:18.280> as<00:02:19.280> you<00:02:19.430> can<00:02:19.520> see<00:02:19.580> in<00:02:19.730> the<00:02:19.790> video<00:02:20.060> I'll

00:02:20.230 --> 00:02:20.240 
as well as you can see in the video I'll

00:02:20.240 --> 00:02:21.610 
as well as you can see in the video I'll
switch<00:02:20.450> up<00:02:20.600> my<00:02:20.630> technique<00:02:21.140> in<00:02:21.290> the<00:02:21.380> middle<00:02:21.560> of

lower in rep count this one I went up a
little<00:02:59.030> bit<00:02:59.270> for<00:02:59.450> more<00:02:59.600> muscle<00:02:59.930> endurance<00:03:03.370> the

00:03:04.360 --> 00:03:04.370 
little bit for more muscle endurance the

00:03:04.370 --> 00:03:05.740 
little bit for more muscle endurance the
