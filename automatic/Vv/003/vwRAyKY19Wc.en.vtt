00:04:34.580 --> 00:04:34.590 
was really bad at the beginning but

00:04:34.590 --> 00:04:37.670 
was really bad at the beginning but
after<00:04:34.650> this<00:04:35.070> look<00:04:35.310> I<00:04:35.550> changed<00:04:35.969> my<00:04:36.210> mind<00:04:37.050> and<00:04:37.320> I

00:04:37.670 --> 00:04:37.680 
after this look I changed my mind and I

00:04:37.680 --> 00:04:40.190 
after this look I changed my mind and I
think<00:04:37.919> it's<00:04:38.070> a<00:04:38.279> really<00:04:38.550> really<00:04:38.789> great<00:04:39.200> weapon

00:04:40.190 --> 00:04:40.200 
think it's a really really great weapon

00:04:40.200 --> 00:04:43.129 
think it's a really really great weapon
especially<00:04:40.770> with<00:04:41.279> excellent<00:04:41.789> mags<00:04:41.969> I<00:04:42.479> don't

00:04:43.129 --> 00:04:43.139 
especially with excellent mags I don't

00:04:43.139 --> 00:04:45.170 
especially with excellent mags I don't
think<00:04:43.320> that<00:04:43.409> the<00:04:43.740> other<00:04:44.060> attachments<00:04:45.060> are

00:04:45.170 --> 00:04:45.180 
think that the other attachments are

00:04:45.180 --> 00:04:47.360 
think that the other attachments are
really<00:04:45.479> good<00:04:45.719> I<00:04:45.930> find<00:04:46.200> us<00:04:46.380> early<00:04:46.740> exit<00:04:47.039> and<00:04:47.190> Max

00:04:47.360 --> 00:04:47.370 
really good I find us early exit and Max

00:04:47.370 --> 00:04:50.060 
really good I find us early exit and Max
is<00:04:47.669> really<00:04:48.120> the<00:04:48.690> thing<00:04:49.050> to<00:04:49.200> put<00:04:49.440> on<00:04:49.620> this
