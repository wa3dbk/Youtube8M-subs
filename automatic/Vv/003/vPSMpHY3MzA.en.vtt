 Hello dear friends with you 

00:00:01.740 --> 00:00:05.940
 money for today on iphone comparison 

00:00:03.570 --> 00:00:07.880
 5 and samsung galaxy s3 mini many 

00:00:05.940 --> 00:00:10.139
 Do not be ashamed to spread this to you 

00:00:07.880 --> 00:00:12.480
 video because of course iphone 

00:00:10.139 --> 00:00:13.740
 does samsung fasting me somehow 

00:00:12.480 --> 00:00:15.870
 I wonder a little 

00:00:13.740 --> 00:00:17.730
 who wants to be here why because 

00:00:15.870 --> 00:00:20.039
 they have the same memory they 

00:00:17.730 --> 00:00:22.109
 talk there in size almost 

00:00:20.039 --> 00:00:23.010
 the same and let's begin this test 

00:00:22.109 --> 00:00:25.740
 exceptions 

00:00:23.010 --> 00:00:27.420
 we will not test benchmarks ourselves and 

00:00:25.740 --> 00:00:31.289
 so on we will be with you just 

00:00:27.420 --> 00:00:33.120
 compare download speeds and so they 

00:00:31.289 --> 00:00:34.950
 almost simultaneously started 

00:00:33.120 --> 00:00:38.280
 there are iPhones an apple appeared at that time 

00:00:34.950 --> 00:00:43.680
 like Samsung, at the same time he's 

00:00:38.280 --> 00:00:45.870
 it was well let's say so in this test we 

00:00:43.680 --> 00:00:48.090
 win now all see for yourself what 

00:00:45.870 --> 00:00:48.570
 for how much memory 1 gigabyte one 

00:00:48.090 --> 00:00:50.760
 gigabyte 

00:00:48.570 --> 00:00:53.840
 4 inch display 4 inch display 

00:00:50.760 --> 00:00:58.800
 480 points 

00:00:53.840 --> 00:01:03.660
 1136 by 640 pixels camera on iphone 

00:00:58.800 --> 00:01:05.820
 us so 8 megapixels on samsung 5 on 

00:01:03.660 --> 00:01:10.650
 5 years very slightly increase the brightness 

00:01:05.820 --> 00:01:13.740
 lest your eyes are not that rape 

00:01:10.650 --> 00:01:15.060
 As for the Samsung then a glitch 

00:01:13.740 --> 00:01:20.060
 small already 

00:01:15.060 --> 00:01:20.060
 as for samsung, it’s here 

00:01:20.270 --> 00:01:28.890
 maximum brightness now let's 

00:01:26.729 --> 00:01:31.590
 let's start testing google chrome first with 

00:01:28.890 --> 00:01:33.600
 what we start and it turns out I already go to 

00:01:31.590 --> 00:01:35.810
 Deep on the iPhone, we will close with you all 

00:01:33.600 --> 00:01:39.630
 applications that is, as you can see, all 

00:01:35.810 --> 00:01:42.659
 closed let's say inadmissible 

00:01:39.630 --> 00:01:46.170
 we will compare 2 damage and the first thing 

00:01:42.659 --> 00:01:50.340
 we will start this samsung site before 1 site 

00:01:46.170 --> 00:01:52.979
 we will go samsung and so then go on 

00:01:50.340 --> 00:01:55.700
 his first thing on the aif.ru sun where 

00:01:52.979 --> 00:01:55.700
 sorry 

00:01:58.369 --> 00:02:08.549
 samsung com and here we have on iphone 

00:02:03.509 --> 00:02:12.180
 we enter samsung.com as for sound 

00:02:08.549 --> 00:02:14.330
 keystrokes on the iPhone it will be more 

00:02:12.180 --> 00:02:21.810
 louder daughter go 

00:02:14.330 --> 00:02:30.709
 Simultaneously press as if he was still 

00:02:21.810 --> 00:02:35.489
 time i miss his samsung.com names 

00:02:30.709 --> 00:02:38.900
 here we will remove was as simple as 

00:02:35.489 --> 00:02:41.190
 I have a clean slate this whole thing start 

00:02:38.900 --> 00:02:43.079
 nothing is set up by both devices 

00:02:41.190 --> 00:02:46.590
 connected to the same wi-fi network here 

00:02:43.079 --> 00:02:49.349
 there will be a medal for a few seconds 

00:02:46.590 --> 00:02:57.599
 seconds will be faster iphone now 

00:02:49.349 --> 00:03:02.780
 give people an apple site so remove it all 

00:02:57.599 --> 00:03:05.370
 and see the site because 

00:03:02.780 --> 00:03:07.109
 As for the iphone will be better in 

00:03:05.370 --> 00:03:09.389
 both cases ie front rear 

00:03:07.109 --> 00:03:12.590
 camera as for ram 

00:03:09.389 --> 00:03:12.590
 the whole thing is the same 

00:03:21.440 --> 00:03:26.360
 So 

00:03:22.860 --> 00:03:26.360
 and spider 

00:03:27.850 --> 00:03:37.270
 I’m not putting up any kind of thing, and here 

00:03:34.900 --> 00:03:40.150
 for some reason we will have samsung s3 mini pay 

00:03:37.270 --> 00:03:42.790
 3 watch what thing faster samsung 

00:03:40.150 --> 00:03:45.970
 uploaded iphone as if faster 

00:03:42.790 --> 00:03:48.010
 samsung such trouble can even be 

00:03:45.970 --> 00:03:50.320
 say now let's invest with 

00:03:48.010 --> 00:03:54.250
 your usual browser safari namely 

00:03:50.320 --> 00:03:56.410
 and here we will usually have internet 

00:03:54.250 --> 00:04:00.510
 may have a day name for me 

00:03:56.410 --> 00:04:00.510
 he stays on smart that is because of me 

00:04:01.560 --> 00:04:09.070
 so let's also 

00:04:06.610 --> 00:04:15.280
 apple and samsung which we do 

00:04:09.070 --> 00:04:20.350
 go apple and do not need to say what 

00:04:15.280 --> 00:04:23.050
 type supposedly why samsung is faster i myself 

00:04:20.350 --> 00:04:33.480
 I know, I'll show this test first 

00:04:23.050 --> 00:04:33.480
 we shone our iphone will be faster 

00:04:33.779 --> 00:04:38.069
 samsung still updates here 

00:04:38.460 --> 00:04:41.620
 iphone now as you can see it would be 

00:04:40.839 --> 00:04:45.029
 completely left 

00:04:41.620 --> 00:04:45.029
 to load everything 

00:04:53.770 --> 00:05:06.930
 oops clicked nevertheless let's go on 

00:04:56.710 --> 00:05:06.930
 samsung samsung com website 

00:05:10.680 --> 00:05:14.850
 there is no ice here. this one too 

00:05:12.960 --> 00:05:19.340
 closely spaced and how would she 

00:05:14.850 --> 00:05:19.340
 small is 

00:05:22.899 --> 00:05:28.159
 that is, as you can see the budget on the contrary more 

00:05:25.669 --> 00:05:34.309
 expensive machine how would he overtake 

00:05:28.159 --> 00:05:36.619
 it's amazing to be honest and again 

00:05:34.309 --> 00:05:40.339
 samsung quick 2 black page like 

00:05:36.619 --> 00:05:42.589
 not sure that at the same time pressed once 

00:05:40.339 --> 00:05:44.330
 it seems to me that before I 

00:05:42.589 --> 00:05:47.119
 there will be a knife 

00:05:44.330 --> 00:05:49.179
 very very very similar now let's 

00:05:47.119 --> 00:05:56.029
 bring a little bit to you from the troops 

00:05:49.179 --> 00:05:58.539
 so so all messed up I already empty bow 

00:05:56.029 --> 00:05:58.539
 iphone 

00:06:01.389 --> 00:06:11.019
 hell sereno said go 

00:06:24.100 --> 00:06:28.840
 but as you can see samsung also with us and 

00:06:26.470 --> 00:06:30.190
 thinks and at the same time well, probably this is my 

00:06:28.840 --> 00:06:32.170
 English Well, in general, of course, in this 

00:06:30.190 --> 00:06:35.200
 plan we will have by virtue of the fact that 

00:06:32.170 --> 00:06:36.910
 better camera better processes and so on 

00:06:35.200 --> 00:06:38.590
 you can say that I am not objective 

00:06:36.910 --> 00:06:40.840
 compared pressed a little earlier on 

00:06:38.590 --> 00:06:43.270
 samsung and it's your business and I do everything 

00:06:40.840 --> 00:06:44.950
 I honestly on both devices the whole thing 

00:06:43.270 --> 00:06:46.840
 launched at the same time we will be katana
