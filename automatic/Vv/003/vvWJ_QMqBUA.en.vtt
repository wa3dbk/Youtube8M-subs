00:06:20.910 --> 00:06:20.920 
he's going to have to defend two

00:06:20.920 --> 00:06:23.160 
he's going to have to defend two
positions<00:06:21.430> at<00:06:21.580> once<00:06:21.720> he<00:06:22.720> needs<00:06:22.930> to<00:06:23.020> get<00:06:23.110> some

00:06:23.160 --> 00:06:23.170 
positions at once he needs to get some

00:06:23.170 --> 00:06:24.420 
positions at once he needs to get some
tanks<00:06:23.620> up<00:06:23.740> there<00:06:23.860> it<00:06:23.920> looks<00:06:24.070> like<00:06:24.220> what<00:06:24.340> he's

00:06:24.420 --> 00:06:24.430 
tanks up there it looks like what he's

00:06:24.430 --> 00:06:27.270 
tanks up there it looks like what he's
going<00:06:24.550> to<00:06:24.580> do<00:06:24.760> is<00:06:25.510> use<00:06:25.720> tanks<00:06:26.680> on<00:06:26.950> the<00:06:27.070> low

00:06:27.270 --> 00:06:27.280 
going to do is use tanks on the low

00:06:27.280 --> 00:06:29.970 
going to do is use tanks on the low
ground<00:06:27.810> once<00:06:28.810> those<00:06:29.020> temples<00:06:29.410> are<00:06:29.560> broken<00:06:29.890> but

00:06:29.970 --> 00:06:29.980 
ground once those temples are broken but

00:06:29.980 --> 00:06:31.570 
ground once those temples are broken but
he<00:06:30.130> really

00:06:31.570 --> 00:06:31.580 
he really

00:06:31.580 --> 00:06:35.320 
he really
should<00:06:32.060> have<00:06:32.150> been<00:06:32.860> well<00:06:33.860> I<00:06:34.460> don't<00:06:35.060> know<00:06:35.180> what

00:06:36.670 --> 00:06:36.680 
he should have been able to do but it

00:06:36.680 --> 00:06:37.809 
he should have been able to do but it
would<00:06:36.770> have<00:06:36.860> been<00:06:36.919> more<00:06:37.069> Ivan<00:06:37.310> taste<00:06:37.490> him<00:06:37.729> to

00:07:27.040 --> 00:07:27.050 
could see him losing too far GG the

00:07:27.050 --> 00:07:29.740 
could see him losing too far GG the
battle<00:07:27.860> of<00:07:27.949> the<00:07:28.069> slumbers<00:07:28.550> he<00:07:29.240> might<00:07:29.539> be

00:07:29.740 --> 00:07:29.750 
battle of the slumbers he might be

00:07:29.750 --> 00:07:31.089

losing the battle of the slumbers here I

00:07:31.099 --> 00:07:32.649 
losing the battle of the slumbers here I
really<00:07:31.460> would<00:07:31.610> have<00:07:31.669> favored<00:07:32.029> fire<00:07:32.240> by<00:07:32.419> hero

00:07:32.649 --> 00:07:32.659 
really would have favored fire by hero

00:07:32.659 --> 00:07:34.179 
really would have favored fire by hero
in<00:07:32.870> the<00:07:33.319> beginning<00:07:33.650> of<00:07:33.710> the<00:07:33.770> match<00:07:33.889> actually

00:07:34.179 --> 00:07:34.189 
in the beginning of the match actually

00:07:34.189 --> 00:07:36.249 
in the beginning of the match actually
because<00:07:34.460> his<00:07:34.580> TV<00:07:34.909> t<00:07:35.060> is<00:07:35.210> very<00:07:35.690> very<00:07:35.870> good<00:07:35.990> when

00:07:36.249 --> 00:07:36.259 
because his TV t is very very good when

00:07:36.259 --> 00:07:39.010 
because his TV t is very very good when
he's<00:07:36.379> really<00:07:36.620> on<00:07:36.650> top<00:07:36.889> of<00:07:36.949> things<00:07:37.870> but<00:07:38.870> he's

00:07:39.010 --> 00:07:39.020 
he's really on top of things but he's

00:07:39.020 --> 00:07:41.290 
he's really on top of things but he's
just<00:07:39.199> not<00:07:39.289> doing<00:07:39.620> so<00:07:39.740> well<00:07:39.770> this<00:07:40.009> game<00:07:40.250> being<00:07:41.240> a

00:07:41.290 --> 00:07:41.300 
just not doing so well this game being a

00:07:41.300 --> 00:07:42.519 
just not doing so well this game being a
little<00:07:41.479> bit<00:07:41.569> sloppy<00:07:41.840> I<00:07:41.960> guess<00:07:42.139> maybe<00:07:42.319> he's

00:07:42.519 --> 00:07:42.529 
little bit sloppy I guess maybe he's

00:07:42.529 --> 00:07:44.559 
little bit sloppy I guess maybe he's
been<00:07:42.680> on<00:07:42.770> break<00:07:43.129> you<00:07:43.879> know<00:07:44.000> the<00:07:44.210> pro<00:07:44.479> league

00:07:45.790 --> 00:07:45.800 
has been on break so he hasn't been able

00:07:45.800 --> 00:07:49.019 
has been on break so he hasn't been able
to<00:07:46.009> do<00:07:46.159> enough<00:07:47.029> practicing<00:07:47.599> I<00:07:47.719> don't<00:07:47.900> know
