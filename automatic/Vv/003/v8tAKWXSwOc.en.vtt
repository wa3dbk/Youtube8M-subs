a<00:01:09.900> hitmarker<00:01:10.080> you<00:01:10.439> know<00:01:10.530> it's<00:01:10.740> just<00:01:10.860> it's<00:01:11.100> that

00:01:11.750 --> 00:01:11.760 
a hitmarker you know it's just it's that

00:01:11.760 --> 00:01:14.270 
a hitmarker you know it's just it's that
game<00:01:12.000> is<00:01:12.210> just<00:01:12.360> so<00:01:12.600> uneven<00:01:13.200> and<00:01:13.409> with<00:01:14.010> the<00:01:14.100> hit

00:01:14.270 --> 00:01:14.280 
game is just so uneven and with the hit

00:01:14.280 --> 00:01:16.070 
game is just so uneven and with the hit
detection<00:01:14.369> it's<00:01:14.850> just<00:01:15.000> terrible<00:01:15.360> that's<00:01:15.900> the

00:01:16.070 --> 00:01:16.080 
detection it's just terrible that's the

00:01:16.080 --> 00:01:17.899 
detection it's just terrible that's the
main<00:01:16.350> reason<00:01:16.380> why<00:01:16.740> I<00:01:16.770> raged<00:01:17.040> in<00:01:17.220> black<00:01:17.430> ops<00:01:17.640> and

00:01:17.899 --> 00:01:17.909 
main reason why I raged in black ops and

00:01:17.909 --> 00:01:20.480 
main reason why I raged in black ops and
my<00:01:18.540> hope<00:01:18.689> mono<00:01:18.869> 43<00:01:19.290> is<00:01:19.380> not<00:01:19.560> like<00:01:19.770> that<00:01:20.009> but<00:01:20.040> it

00:01:20.480 --> 00:01:20.490 
my hope mono 43 is not like that but it

00:01:20.490 --> 00:01:21.620 
my hope mono 43 is not like that but it
shouldn't<00:01:20.820> be<00:01:20.850> because<00:01:20.970> it's<00:01:21.180> not<00:01:21.330> made<00:01:21.600> by

00:01:21.620 --> 00:01:21.630 
shouldn't be because it's not made by

I<00:01:47.790> have<00:01:48.000> not<00:01:48.149> raged<00:01:48.450> on<00:01:48.600> at<00:01:48.750> once<00:01:48.930> I<00:01:49.049> don't

00:01:49.069 --> 00:01:49.079 
I have not raged on at once I don't

00:01:49.079 --> 00:01:51.410 
I have not raged on at once I don't
think<00:01:49.439> I<00:01:49.619> mean<00:01:49.829> you<00:01:49.920> can<00:01:50.040> fly<00:01:50.189> jets<00:01:50.549> the<00:01:51.210> maps

00:01:51.410 --> 00:01:51.420 
think I mean you can fly jets the maps

00:01:51.420 --> 00:01:54.499 
think I mean you can fly jets the maps
are<00:01:51.600> gigantic<00:01:52.590> too<00:01:52.829> I<00:01:53.070> mean<00:01:53.640> it's<00:01:54.000> that's<00:01:54.360> the

00:01:54.499 --> 00:01:54.509 
are gigantic too I mean it's that's the

00:01:54.509 --> 00:01:55.910 
are gigantic too I mean it's that's the
good<00:01:54.630> thing<00:01:54.689> about<00:01:54.840> to<00:01:55.200> but<00:01:55.409> if<00:01:55.560> you're<00:01:55.740> not

00:01:55.910 --> 00:01:55.920 
good thing about to but if you're not

00:01:55.920 --> 00:01:57.679 
good thing about to but if you're not
flying<00:01:56.159> a<00:01:56.340> jet<00:01:56.369> in<00:01:56.729> one<00:01:56.880> those<00:01:57.000> big<00:01:57.180> maps<00:01:57.420> it's

00:01:57.679 --> 00:01:57.689 
flying a jet in one those big maps it's

00:01:57.689 --> 00:01:59.149 
flying a jet in one those big maps it's
it's<00:01:58.200> pretty<00:01:58.409> hard<00:01:58.560> to<00:01:58.619> get<00:01:58.740> off<00:01:58.829> and<00:01:58.950> get<00:01:59.040> a

00:01:59.149 --> 00:01:59.159 
it's pretty hard to get off and get a

00:01:59.159 --> 00:02:01.910 
it's pretty hard to get off and get a
kill<00:01:59.369> but<00:01:59.670> I<00:01:59.969> mean<00:02:00.450> it's<00:02:00.600> it's<00:02:00.869> it's<00:02:01.649> a<00:02:01.710> really

00:02:01.910 --> 00:02:01.920 
kill but I mean it's it's it's a really

00:02:01.920 --> 00:02:03.440 
kill but I mean it's it's it's a really
fun<00:02:02.009> game<00:02:02.219> found<00:02:02.640> picked<00:02:02.790> it<00:02:02.880> up<00:02:02.969> already<00:02:03.180> and

know<00:03:58.450> notch1<00:03:59.380> coins<00:03:59.890> I<00:04:00.040> guess<00:04:00.190> because<00:04:00.310> I'd<00:04:00.490> be

00:04:00.630 --> 00:04:00.640 
know notch1 coins I guess because I'd be

00:04:00.640 --> 00:04:02.130 
know notch1 coins I guess because I'd be
kind<00:04:00.850> of<00:04:00.910> ridiculous<00:04:01.060> but<00:04:01.480> you<00:04:01.960> know<00:04:02.050> you

00:04:02.130 --> 00:04:02.140 
kind of ridiculous but you know you

00:04:02.140 --> 00:04:03.420 
kind of ridiculous but you know you
could<00:04:02.290> end<00:04:02.440> it<00:04:02.560> really<00:04:02.890> quick<00:04:03.070> and<00:04:03.220> people

00:04:03.420 --> 00:04:03.430 
could end it really quick and people

00:04:03.430 --> 00:04:05.130 
could end it really quick and people
didn't<00:04:03.640> like<00:04:03.670> that<00:04:03.940> idea<00:04:04.090> so<00:04:04.690> now<00:04:04.900> they're

00:04:05.130 --> 00:04:05.140 
didn't like that idea so now they're

00:04:05.140 --> 00:04:06.540 
didn't like that idea so now they're
bringing<00:04:05.410> back<00:04:05.440> this<00:04:05.740> as<00:04:05.980> not<00:04:06.280> even<00:04:06.490> a
