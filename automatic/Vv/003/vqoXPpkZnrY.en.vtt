00:00:07.590 --> 00:00:10.340
 like you 

00:00:15.160 --> 00:00:18.850
 it's like being books that are 

00:00:16.930 --> 00:00:21.189
 welcome here to this new video les 

00:00:18.850 --> 00:00:23.200
 I bring a new gameplay of what's coming 

00:00:21.189 --> 00:00:25.570
 being opening envelopes uncovering envelopes 

00:00:23.200 --> 00:00:27.340
 you know , this plant came out buying 

00:00:25.570 --> 00:00:29.099
 an envelope of 20 thousand I got the last 

00:00:27.340 --> 00:00:32.680
 piece and good we are in the new map 

00:00:29.099 --> 00:00:34.809
 we are in a new map of the dlc so 

00:00:32.680 --> 00:00:37.420
 Well let's see how we are going 

00:00:34.809 --> 00:00:40.449
 over here this plant has a good damage 

00:00:37.420 --> 00:00:43.330
 it has a good damage the chilies that good 

00:00:40.449 --> 00:00:45.220
 but as it burns the others like 

00:00:43.330 --> 00:00:47.950
 the enemies burn good those damage is 

00:00:45.220 --> 00:00:49.600
 of between 4 and 5 which is fine because 

00:00:47.950 --> 00:00:51.700
 if I did a little more damage apart 

00:00:49.600 --> 00:00:55.059
 of the damage that burning occasions would be 

00:00:51.700 --> 00:00:57.620
 very powerful in my point of view like this 

00:00:55.059 --> 00:01:00.739
 what are we going to see 

00:00:57.620 --> 00:01:04.220
 Let's try point-blank 

00:01:00.739 --> 00:01:06.650
 gets to inflict up to 77 in the little head 

00:01:04.220 --> 00:01:08.090
 and point-blank 

00:01:06.650 --> 00:01:10.550
 I think that I think that's something that 

00:01:08.090 --> 00:01:13.250
 it bothers a lot of people the fact that you 

00:01:10.550 --> 00:01:15.590
 start burning because it is not so much 

00:01:13.250 --> 00:01:17.300
 like the plant itself or the zombie 

00:01:15.590 --> 00:01:18.950
 I think the fact that it starts you 

00:01:17.300 --> 00:01:21.560
 and burn tem and ceat to start 

00:01:18.950 --> 00:01:23.540
 change the character's vision and then 

00:01:21.560 --> 00:01:26.130
 the view this if it does a little 

00:01:23.540 --> 00:01:28.079
 annoying 

00:01:26.130 --> 00:01:30.960
 if you do it a little bit annoying or at least 

00:01:28.079 --> 00:01:34.060
 It bothers me a lot that they are 

00:01:30.960 --> 00:01:37.450
 shooting with fire characters 

00:01:34.060 --> 00:01:39.640
 the only thing is that he has 30 bullets he has 30 

00:01:37.450 --> 00:01:43.110
 bullets instead of 50 that's like the ones 

00:01:39.640 --> 00:01:45.480
 They usually have sunflowers 

00:01:43.110 --> 00:01:49.980
 and that also because they already know about their 

00:01:45.480 --> 00:01:52.590
 damage but good let's see how 

00:01:49.980 --> 00:01:53.970
 we're going to start moving 

00:01:52.590 --> 00:01:57.760
 a very small map is a very map 

00:01:53.970 --> 00:02:02.320
 closed for walking that is not bad 

00:01:57.760 --> 00:02:05.890
 It's cool the matter I kill myself finished 

00:02:02.320 --> 00:02:07.930
 killing or not that is another yes yes yes I said 

00:02:05.890 --> 00:02:10.660
 I ended up killing myself and I did not do anything to him 

00:02:07.930 --> 00:02:12.190
 year as well as who gave me to see what are 

00:02:10.660 --> 00:02:15.130
 the challenges up to three high with desire 

00:02:12.190 --> 00:02:17.380
 to upload 10 drones and 4 companions 75 

00:02:15.130 --> 00:02:19.090
 times every time the challenges are more 

00:02:17.380 --> 00:02:22.020
 delayed no more difficult but without more 

00:02:19.090 --> 00:02:25.700
 taken so 

00:02:22.020 --> 00:02:27.709

00:02:27.709 --> 00:02:30.670
 we found around here 

00:02:31.420 --> 00:02:36.160

00:02:33.550 --> 00:02:39.790
