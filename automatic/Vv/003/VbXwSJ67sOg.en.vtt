00:00:57.439 --> 00:00:57.449 
see that there on the map and we can see

00:00:57.449 --> 00:00:59.529 
see that there on the map and we can see
the<00:00:57.600> first<00:00:57.840> piece<00:00:58.260> there<00:00:58.710> on<00:00:58.949> that<00:00:59.190> pillar

00:00:59.529 --> 00:00:59.539 
the first piece there on that pillar

00:00:59.539 --> 00:01:04.390 
the first piece there on that pillar
what<00:01:00.539> we<00:01:00.690> want<00:01:00.870> to<00:01:00.989> do<00:01:01.140> is<00:01:01.500> turn<00:01:02.010> around<00:01:02.070> and

camera point that camera up and right at

00:01:48.619 --> 00:02:37.730 
camera point that camera up and right at
that<00:01:48.740> code<00:01:49.030> here<00:01:50.030> we<00:01:50.119> go

00:02:37.730 --> 00:02:37.740
