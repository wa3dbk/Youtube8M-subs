00:00:00.030 --> 00:00:04.309 

so<00:00:00.810> here's<00:00:01.350> our<00:00:01.500> example<00:00:02.070> we<00:00:02.280> have<00:00:02.310> skis<00:00:03.319> some

00:00:04.309 --> 00:00:04.319 
so here's our example we have skis some

00:00:04.319 --> 00:00:06.200 
so here's our example we have skis some
keep<00:00:04.560> movement<00:00:05.069> but<00:00:05.220> there's<00:00:05.700> two<00:00:05.940> major

00:00:06.200 --> 00:00:06.210 
keep movement but there's two major

00:00:06.210 --> 00:00:08.780 
keep movement but there's two major
flaws<00:00:06.720> well<00:00:07.500> there's<00:00:07.680> a<00:00:07.740> few<00:00:07.950> flaws<00:00:08.189> but<00:00:08.460> to

00:00:08.780 --> 00:00:08.790 
flaws well there's a few flaws but to

00:00:08.790 --> 00:00:11.509 
flaws well there's a few flaws but to
the<00:00:08.970> first<00:00:09.719> apparent<00:00:10.290> major<00:00:10.769> flaw<00:00:11.099> should<00:00:11.400> be

00:00:11.509 --> 00:00:11.519 
the first apparent major flaw should be

00:00:11.519 --> 00:00:13.520 
the first apparent major flaw should be
one<00:00:11.730> notice<00:00:12.540> what<00:00:12.750> happens<00:00:13.019> when<00:00:13.139> I<00:00:13.170> push<00:00:13.380> the

00:00:13.520 --> 00:00:13.530 
one notice what happens when I push the

00:00:13.530 --> 00:00:14.870 
one notice what happens when I push the
right<00:00:13.679> arrow<00:00:13.740> I'll<00:00:14.070> push<00:00:14.370> the<00:00:14.519> right<00:00:14.639> arrow

00:00:14.870 --> 00:00:14.880 
right arrow I'll push the right arrow

00:00:14.880 --> 00:00:16.760 
right arrow I'll push the right arrow
and<00:00:15.120> the<00:00:15.480> ship<00:00:15.719> it'll<00:00:15.900> move<00:00:16.080> a<00:00:16.199> little<00:00:16.440> bit<00:00:16.560> and

00:00:16.760 --> 00:00:16.770 
and the ship it'll move a little bit and

00:00:16.770 --> 00:00:18.710 
and the ship it'll move a little bit and
then<00:00:17.279> it'll<00:00:17.520> start<00:00:17.760> moving<00:00:17.880> very<00:00:18.150> quickly<00:00:18.330> so

00:00:18.710 --> 00:00:18.720 
then it'll start moving very quickly so

00:00:18.720 --> 00:00:20.810 
then it'll start moving very quickly so
it's<00:00:18.840> like<00:00:18.990> pop<00:00:19.380> pop<00:00:19.710> up<00:00:20.130> up<00:00:20.279> up<00:00:20.400> up<00:00:20.520> up<00:00:20.670> up

00:00:20.810 --> 00:00:20.820 
it's like pop pop up up up up up up

00:00:20.820 --> 00:00:22.010 
it's like pop pop up up up up up up
let's<00:00:21.510> go<00:00:21.630> left

00:00:22.010 --> 00:00:22.020 
let's go left

00:00:22.020 --> 00:00:23.750

00:00:40.700 --> 00:00:40.710 
left and up at the same time we just go

00:00:40.710 --> 00:00:44.030 
left and up at the same time we just go
up<00:00:40.739> we<00:00:41.070> don't<00:00:41.219> go<00:00:42.620> diagonally<00:00:43.620> so<00:00:43.800> to<00:00:43.860> say

00:00:44.030 --> 00:00:44.040 
up we don't go diagonally so to say

00:00:44.040 --> 00:00:47.600 
up we don't go diagonally so to say
let's<00:00:44.280> go<00:00:44.370> down<00:00:44.640> and<00:00:45.600> then<00:00:45.809> right<00:00:46.050> and<00:00:46.610> right

00:00:47.600 --> 00:00:47.610 
let's go down and then right and right

00:00:47.610 --> 00:00:49.040 
let's go down and then right and right
swinging<00:00:48.030> but<00:00:48.180> then<00:00:48.300> I'll<00:00:48.390> hit<00:00:48.510> down<00:00:48.719> and<00:00:48.989> now

00:00:49.040 --> 00:00:49.050 
swinging but then I'll hit down and now

00:00:49.050 --> 00:00:50.869 
swinging but then I'll hit down and now
downs<00:00:49.320> winning<00:00:49.710> we're<00:00:49.829> not<00:00:49.980> we're<00:00:50.550> not<00:00:50.640> going

00:00:50.869 --> 00:00:50.879 
downs winning we're not we're not going

00:00:50.879 --> 00:00:53.600 
downs winning we're not we're not going
both<00:00:51.120> directions<00:00:51.449> at<00:00:51.750> the<00:00:51.809> same<00:00:51.870> time<00:00:52.309> so<00:00:53.309> that

00:00:53.600 --> 00:00:53.610 
both directions at the same time so that

00:00:53.610 --> 00:00:55.549 
both directions at the same time so that
is<00:00:53.969> two<00:00:54.329> major<00:00:54.570> flaws<00:00:54.930> with<00:00:55.199> our<00:00:55.350> current

00:00:55.549 --> 00:00:55.559 
is two major flaws with our current

00:00:55.559 --> 00:00:57.799 
is two major flaws with our current
system<00:00:55.829> well<00:00:56.219> let's<00:00:57.030> let's<00:00:57.300> address<00:00:57.510> one

00:00:57.799 --> 00:00:57.809 
system well let's let's address one

00:00:57.809 --> 00:00:59.479 
system well let's let's address one
problem<00:00:58.140> at<00:00:58.230> a<00:00:58.289> time<00:00:58.320> and<00:00:58.739> we'll<00:00:59.129> probably<00:00:59.340> end

00:00:59.479 --> 00:00:59.489 
problem at a time and we'll probably end

00:00:59.489 --> 00:01:01.580 
problem at a time and we'll probably end
up<00:00:59.609> killing<00:00:59.850> both<00:01:00.059> at<00:01:00.270> the<00:01:00.359> same<00:01:00.539> time<00:01:00.780> but<00:01:00.989> if

00:01:01.580 --> 00:01:01.590 
up killing both at the same time but if

00:01:01.590 --> 00:01:03.110 
up killing both at the same time but if
I<00:01:01.739> if<00:01:01.859> I<00:01:01.980> go<00:01:02.129> right<00:01:02.370> the<00:01:02.579> reason<00:01:02.820> why<00:01:02.910> we<00:01:03.000> get

00:01:03.110 --> 00:01:03.120 
I if I go right the reason why we get

00:01:03.120 --> 00:01:04.640 
I if I go right the reason why we get
that<00:01:03.239> slight<00:01:03.539> pause<00:01:03.780> is<00:01:04.140> because<00:01:04.379> GUI

00:01:04.640 --> 00:01:04.650 
that slight pause is because GUI

00:01:04.650 --> 00:01:09.170 
that slight pause is because GUI
libraries<00:01:05.600> with<00:01:06.600> their<00:01:06.750> event<00:01:07.080> systems<00:01:08.180> they

00:01:09.170 --> 00:01:09.180 
libraries with their event systems they

00:01:09.180 --> 00:01:10.580 
libraries with their event systems they
and<00:01:09.479> they<00:01:09.540> pause<00:01:09.780> it<00:01:09.990> so<00:01:10.020> it's<00:01:10.229> kind<00:01:10.380> of<00:01:10.409> like<00:01:10.500> I

00:01:10.580 --> 00:01:10.590 
and they pause it so it's kind of like I

00:01:10.590 --> 00:01:13.219 
and they pause it so it's kind of like I
push<00:01:10.799> the<00:01:10.950> right<00:01:11.159> arrow<00:01:11.400> and<00:01:11.760> QT<00:01:12.390> that's<00:01:13.020> the

00:01:13.219 --> 00:01:13.229 
push the right arrow and QT that's the

00:01:13.229 --> 00:01:14.450 
push the right arrow and QT that's the
green<00:01:13.409> library<00:01:13.740> you're<00:01:13.950> using<00:01:14.070> here<00:01:14.340> it's

00:01:14.450 --> 00:01:14.460 
green library you're using here it's

00:01:14.460 --> 00:01:17.179 
green library you're using here it's
cute<00:01:14.840> it<00:01:15.840> says<00:01:16.140> hey<00:01:16.290> oh<00:01:16.470> the<00:01:16.799> right<00:01:16.920> arrow<00:01:17.100> is

00:01:17.179 --> 00:01:17.189 
cute it says hey oh the right arrow is

00:01:17.189 --> 00:01:18.620 
cute it says hey oh the right arrow is
down<00:01:17.369> and<00:01:17.520> it<00:01:17.610> immediately<00:01:17.850> fires<00:01:18.390> an<00:01:18.570> event

00:01:18.620 --> 00:01:18.630 
down and it immediately fires an event

00:01:18.630 --> 00:01:21.410 
down and it immediately fires an event
and<00:01:19.110> then<00:01:19.470> our<00:01:19.590> ship<00:01:19.799> moves<00:01:20.189> but<00:01:21.030> then<00:01:21.119> after

00:01:21.410 --> 00:01:21.420 
and then our ship moves but then after

00:01:21.420 --> 00:01:23.300 
and then our ship moves but then after
that<00:01:21.509> split-second<00:01:22.229> amount<00:01:22.439> of<00:01:22.500> time<00:01:22.710> qts

00:01:23.300 --> 00:01:23.310 
that split-second amount of time qts

00:01:23.310 --> 00:01:27.710 
that split-second amount of time qts
like<00:01:23.490> km<00:01:25.040> the<00:01:26.040> right<00:01:26.220> arrow<00:01:26.430> it's<00:01:27.420> still<00:01:27.600> down

00:01:27.710 --> 00:01:27.720 
like km the right arrow it's still down

00:01:27.720 --> 00:01:29.719 
like km the right arrow it's still down
guys<00:01:28.049> maybe<00:01:28.740> we<00:01:28.829> should<00:01:28.979> like<00:01:29.130> start<00:01:29.430> firing

00:01:29.719 --> 00:01:29.729 
guys maybe we should like start firing

00:01:29.729 --> 00:01:31.880 
guys maybe we should like start firing
off<00:01:29.970> the<00:01:30.090> all<00:01:30.210> these<00:01:30.360> events<00:01:30.570> rapidly<00:01:31.229> all

00:01:31.880 --> 00:01:31.890 
off the all these events rapidly all

00:01:31.890 --> 00:01:32.960 
off the all these events rapidly all
right<00:01:32.009> so<00:01:32.189> that's<00:01:32.310> why<00:01:32.490> we're<00:01:32.670> seeing<00:01:32.820> the

00:01:32.960 --> 00:01:32.970 
right so that's why we're seeing the

00:01:32.970 --> 00:01:34.520 
right so that's why we're seeing the
behavior<00:01:33.090> we're<00:01:33.479> seeing<00:01:33.720> is<00:01:33.869> right

00:01:34.520 --> 00:01:34.530 
behavior we're seeing is right

00:01:34.530 --> 00:01:36.170 
behavior we're seeing is right
oh<00:01:34.560> oh<00:01:35.130> oh<00:01:35.159> they<00:01:35.549> still<00:01:35.729> want<00:01:35.850> to<00:01:35.909> keep<00:01:36.030> going

00:01:36.170 --> 00:01:36.180 
oh oh oh they still want to keep going

00:01:36.180 --> 00:01:40.130 
oh oh oh they still want to keep going
all<00:01:37.170> right<00:01:37.380> well<00:01:37.619> let's<00:01:37.890> not<00:01:38.130> rely<00:01:38.759> on<00:01:39.140> that

00:01:40.130 --> 00:01:40.140 
all right well let's not rely on that

00:01:40.140 --> 00:01:42.620 
all right well let's not rely on that
behavior<00:01:40.619> in<00:01:40.740> fact<00:01:41.009> hopefully<00:01:41.909> well<00:01:42.210> maybe

00:01:42.620 --> 00:01:42.630 
behavior in fact hopefully well maybe

00:01:42.630 --> 00:01:44.240 
behavior in fact hopefully well maybe
maybe<00:01:42.960> not<00:01:43.170> if<00:01:43.320> you're<00:01:43.470> used<00:01:43.979> to<00:01:44.070> GUI

00:01:44.240 --> 00:01:44.250 
maybe not if you're used to GUI

00:01:44.250 --> 00:01:45.649 
maybe not if you're used to GUI
programming<00:01:44.700> maybe<00:01:44.970> you<00:01:45.149> saw<00:01:45.329> this<00:01:45.479> and

00:01:45.649 --> 00:01:45.659 
programming maybe you saw this and

00:01:45.659 --> 00:01:47.749 
programming maybe you saw this and
thought<00:01:45.720> you're<00:01:46.079> gonna<00:01:46.200> use<00:01:46.470> GUI<00:01:47.159> events<00:01:47.610> for

00:01:47.749 --> 00:01:47.759 
thought you're gonna use GUI events for

00:01:47.759 --> 00:01:50.990 
thought you're gonna use GUI events for
your<00:01:47.880> game<00:01:48.149> for<00:01:48.990> real<00:01:49.220> know<00:01:50.220> what<00:01:50.490> we<00:01:50.579> want<00:01:50.790> to

00:01:50.990 --> 00:01:51.000 
your game for real know what we want to

00:01:51.000 --> 00:01:54.380 
your game for real know what we want to
do<00:01:51.180> is<00:01:51.600> in<00:01:52.110> the<00:01:52.200> update<00:01:52.649> we<00:01:52.829> want<00:01:52.920> to<00:01:53.070> pull<00:01:53.390> all

00:01:54.380 --> 00:01:54.390 
do is in the update we want to pull all

00:01:54.390 --> 00:01:56.480 
do is in the update we want to pull all
right<00:01:54.750> this<00:01:55.049> is<00:01:55.170> kind<00:01:55.290> of<00:01:55.380> like<00:01:55.470> QT<00:01:55.920> is<00:01:56.009> pushing

00:01:56.480 --> 00:01:56.490 
right this is kind of like QT is pushing

00:01:56.490 --> 00:01:58.609 
right this is kind of like QT is pushing
the<00:01:56.610> event<00:01:56.909> to<00:01:57.090> us<00:01:57.210> and<00:01:57.450> stand-in<00:01:58.320> here<00:01:58.380> we

00:01:58.609 --> 00:01:58.619 
the event to us and stand-in here we

00:01:58.619 --> 00:02:00.830 
the event to us and stand-in here we
want<00:01:58.770> a<00:01:58.799> poll<00:01:59.009> on<00:01:59.100> say<00:01:59.280> home<00:01:59.490> is<00:01:59.880> the<00:02:00.479> arrow<00:02:00.630> key

00:02:00.830 --> 00:02:00.840 
want a poll on say home is the arrow key

00:02:00.840 --> 00:02:02.330 
want a poll on say home is the arrow key
down<00:02:00.869> is<00:02:01.259> the<00:02:01.380> Alt<00:02:01.530> key<00:02:01.590> down<00:02:01.710> as<00:02:02.100> the<00:02:02.189> arrow

00:02:02.330 --> 00:02:02.340 
down is the Alt key down as the arrow

00:02:02.340 --> 00:02:04.160 
down is the Alt key down as the arrow
key<00:02:02.549> down<00:02:02.579> as<00:02:02.939> you<00:02:03.090> down<00:02:03.540> instead<00:02:03.840> of<00:02:03.960> waiting

00:02:04.160 --> 00:02:04.170 
key down as you down instead of waiting

00:02:04.170 --> 00:02:07.069 
key down as you down instead of waiting
here<00:02:04.439> and<00:02:04.560> say<00:02:04.649> um<00:02:05.420> we'll<00:02:06.420> move<00:02:06.600> when<00:02:06.659> you<00:02:06.899> tell

00:02:07.069 --> 00:02:07.079 
here and say um we'll move when you tell

00:02:07.079 --> 00:02:09.469 
here and say um we'll move when you tell
us<00:02:07.170> the<00:02:07.290> L<00:02:07.409> Keys<00:02:07.649> down<00:02:08.030> so<00:02:09.030> we're<00:02:09.119> gonna<00:02:09.209> pull

00:02:09.469 --> 00:02:09.479 
us the L Keys down so we're gonna pull

00:02:09.479 --> 00:02:11.839 
us the L Keys down so we're gonna pull
and<00:02:09.959> then<00:02:10.259> also<00:02:10.440> on<00:02:10.860> this<00:02:11.009> event<00:02:11.250> fires<00:02:11.550> it

00:02:11.839 --> 00:02:11.849 
and then also on this event fires it

00:02:11.849 --> 00:02:13.520 
and then also on this event fires it
only<00:02:12.030> tells<00:02:12.270> us<00:02:12.420> about<00:02:12.540> one<00:02:12.870> key

00:02:13.520 --> 00:02:13.530 
only tells us about one key

00:02:13.530 --> 00:02:16.190 
only tells us about one key
at<00:02:14.070> a<00:02:14.190> time<00:02:14.520> we<00:02:14.760> only<00:02:14.880> it's<00:02:15.420> either<00:02:15.600> up<00:02:15.810> or<00:02:16.080> it's

00:02:16.190 --> 00:02:16.200 
at a time we only it's either up or it's

00:02:16.200 --> 00:02:18.020 
at a time we only it's either up or it's
down<00:02:16.380> it's<00:02:16.650> not<00:02:16.740> left<00:02:17.100> or<00:02:17.220> right<00:02:17.400> or<00:02:17.550> both<00:02:17.670> it's

00:02:18.020 --> 00:02:18.030 
down it's not left or right or both it's

00:02:18.030 --> 00:02:20.750 
down it's not left or right or both it's
it's<00:02:18.810> it's<00:02:19.710> one<00:02:19.890> or<00:02:19.980> the<00:02:20.070> other<00:02:20.220> or<00:02:20.280> not<00:02:20.490> but

00:02:20.750 --> 00:02:20.760 
it's it's one or the other or not but

00:02:20.760 --> 00:02:23.390 
it's it's one or the other or not but
not<00:02:20.880> both<00:02:22.160> okay

00:02:23.390 --> 00:02:23.400 
not both okay

00:02:23.400 --> 00:02:25.670 
not both okay
so<00:02:23.970> how<00:02:24.060> are<00:02:24.120> we<00:02:24.180> gonna<00:02:24.300> fix<00:02:24.540> that<00:02:24.720> well<00:02:24.960> it

00:02:25.670 --> 00:02:25.680 
so how are we gonna fix that well it

00:02:25.680 --> 00:02:31.190 
so how are we gonna fix that well it
just<00:02:25.710> so<00:02:26.040> happens<00:02:26.070> to<00:02:27.710> be<00:02:28.710> a<00:02:29.780> function<00:02:30.780> in

00:02:31.190 --> 00:02:31.200 
just so happens to be a function in

00:02:31.200 --> 00:02:34.570 
just so happens to be a function in
Windows<00:02:31.590> called<00:02:31.890> get<00:02:32.310> a<00:02:32.490> sync<00:02:33.030> key<00:02:33.660> state<00:02:33.990> and

00:02:34.570 --> 00:02:34.580 
Windows called get a sync key state and

00:02:34.580 --> 00:02:37.250 
Windows called get a sync key state and
this<00:02:35.580> function<00:02:36.150> basically<00:02:36.750> allows<00:02:36.960> us<00:02:36.990> to

00:02:37.250 --> 00:02:37.260 
this function basically allows us to

00:02:37.260 --> 00:02:40.010 
this function basically allows us to
pull<00:02:37.440> and<00:02:37.560> say<00:02:37.680> hey<00:02:37.860> is<00:02:38.850> this<00:02:39.180> button<00:02:39.600> down<00:02:39.840> as

00:02:40.010 --> 00:02:40.020 
pull and say hey is this button down as

00:02:40.020 --> 00:02:41.330 
pull and say hey is this button down as
this<00:02:40.140> button<00:02:40.440> down<00:02:40.590> as<00:02:40.740> this<00:02:40.860> button<00:02:41.220> down

00:02:41.330 --> 00:02:41.340 
this button down as this button down

00:02:41.340 --> 00:02:44.540 
this button down as this button down
alright<00:02:42.150> and<00:02:42.360> we<00:02:43.200> give<00:02:43.560> it<00:02:43.650> a<00:02:43.710> key<00:02:43.920> code<00:02:44.190> which

00:02:44.540 --> 00:02:44.550 
alright and we give it a key code which

00:02:44.550 --> 00:02:46.699 
alright and we give it a key code which
is<00:02:44.790> these<00:02:45.270> key<00:02:45.600> codes<00:02:45.840> over<00:02:45.990> here<00:02:46.320> we<00:02:46.530> can<00:02:46.680> use

00:02:46.699 --> 00:02:46.709 
is these key codes over here we can use

00:02:46.709 --> 00:02:48.560 
is these key codes over here we can use
this<00:02:47.010> looks<00:02:47.220> hopefully<00:02:47.760> this<00:02:47.910> list<00:02:48.360> looks

00:02:48.560 --> 00:02:48.570 
this looks hopefully this list looks

00:02:48.570 --> 00:02:50.360 
this looks hopefully this list looks
familiar<00:02:48.750> it's<00:02:49.230> similar<00:02:49.680> to<00:02:49.920> the<00:02:49.980> one<00:02:50.100> we<00:02:50.190> saw

00:02:50.360 --> 00:02:50.370 
familiar it's similar to the one we saw

00:02:50.370 --> 00:02:54.140 
familiar it's similar to the one we saw
with<00:02:50.520> the<00:02:50.580> Qt<00:02:50.880> library<00:02:52.610> we<00:02:53.610> can<00:02:53.760> say<00:02:53.910> hey<00:02:54.030> is

00:02:54.140 --> 00:02:54.150 
with the Qt library we can say hey is

00:02:54.150 --> 00:02:55.699 
with the Qt library we can say hey is
the<00:02:54.240> button<00:02:54.480> down<00:02:54.600> as<00:02:54.750> the<00:02:54.840> button<00:02:55.050> down<00:02:55.200> now

00:02:55.699 --> 00:02:55.709 
the button down as the button down now

00:02:55.709 --> 00:02:58.430 
the button down as the button down now
hopefully<00:02:56.340> that<00:02:56.970> depends<00:02:57.720> depends<00:02:58.170> on<00:02:58.260> how

00:02:58.430 --> 00:02:58.440 
hopefully that depends depends on how

00:02:58.440 --> 00:03:00.350 
hopefully that depends depends on how
much<00:02:58.620> experience<00:02:58.650> you<00:02:59.250> had<00:02:59.430> if<00:02:59.910> you<00:03:00.060> haven't

00:03:00.350 --> 00:03:00.360 
much experience you had if you haven't

00:03:00.360 --> 00:03:02.240 
much experience you had if you haven't
had<00:03:00.480> a<00:03:00.750> lot<00:03:00.990> of<00:03:01.110> experience<00:03:01.680> that's<00:03:01.860> fine<00:03:02.040> but

00:03:02.240 --> 00:03:02.250 
had a lot of experience that's fine but

00:03:02.250 --> 00:03:03.320 
had a lot of experience that's fine but
if<00:03:02.310> you<00:03:02.370> had<00:03:02.550> a<00:03:02.580> lot<00:03:02.760> of<00:03:02.820> experience<00:03:03.209> you're

00:03:03.320 --> 00:03:03.330 
if you had a lot of experience you're

00:03:03.330 --> 00:03:04.430 
if you had a lot of experience you're
thinking<00:03:03.630> Jamie

00:03:04.430 --> 00:03:04.440

um<00:03:04.680> this<00:03:05.640> is<00:03:05.790> a<00:03:05.820> Windows<00:03:06.240> function<00:03:06.840> and<00:03:07.110> with

00:03:07.880 --> 00:03:07.890 
um this is a Windows function and with

00:03:07.890 --> 00:03:10.310 
um this is a Windows function and with
the<00:03:08.040> clock<00:03:08.459> class<00:03:08.790> when<00:03:09.510> we<00:03:09.540> were<00:03:09.690> doing<00:03:10.050> that

00:03:10.310 --> 00:03:10.320 
the clock class when we were doing that

00:03:10.320 --> 00:03:13.790 
the clock class when we were doing that
high<00:03:11.220> performance<00:03:11.280> counter<00:03:12.060> code<00:03:12.620> that<00:03:13.620> we

00:03:13.790 --> 00:03:13.800 
high performance counter code that we

00:03:13.800 --> 00:03:15.110 
high performance counter code that we
were<00:03:13.890> calling<00:03:14.070> windows<00:03:14.400> functions<00:03:14.820> there<00:03:15.000> as

00:03:15.110 --> 00:03:15.120 
were calling windows functions there as

00:03:15.120 --> 00:03:17.330 
were calling windows functions there as
well<00:03:15.330> and<00:03:15.570> well<00:03:16.110> what<00:03:16.680> if<00:03:16.770> I<00:03:16.860> want<00:03:17.070> to<00:03:17.130> run<00:03:17.280> my

00:03:17.330 --> 00:03:17.340 
well and well what if I want to run my

00:03:17.340 --> 00:03:20.600 
well and well what if I want to run my
game<00:03:17.760> on<00:03:17.790> more<00:03:18.239> than<00:03:18.420> just<00:03:18.720> windows<00:03:19.489> you<00:03:20.489> know

00:03:20.600 --> 00:03:20.610 
game on more than just windows you know

00:03:20.610 --> 00:03:22.729 
game on more than just windows you know
last<00:03:20.820> time<00:03:20.970> I<00:03:21.030> checked<00:03:21.150> the<00:03:21.570> Windows<00:03:22.320> Phone

00:03:22.729 --> 00:03:22.739 
last time I checked the Windows Phone

00:03:22.739 --> 00:03:24.229 
last time I checked the Windows Phone
wasn't<00:03:23.250> doing<00:03:23.459> very<00:03:23.489> well<00:03:23.820> compared<00:03:24.209> to

00:03:24.229 --> 00:03:24.239 
wasn't doing very well compared to

00:03:24.239 --> 00:03:27.500 
wasn't doing very well compared to
Android<00:03:24.720> and<00:03:24.750> iPhone<00:03:25.620> development<00:03:26.040> so<00:03:26.940> so

00:03:27.500 --> 00:03:27.510 
Android and iPhone development so so

00:03:27.510 --> 00:03:29.900 
Android and iPhone development so so
what<00:03:27.630> if<00:03:27.690> I<00:03:27.750> want<00:03:27.900> to<00:03:27.959> use<00:03:28.050> that<00:03:28.080> well<00:03:28.910> that's

00:03:29.900 --> 00:03:29.910 
what if I want to use that well that's

00:03:29.910 --> 00:03:32.570 
what if I want to use that well that's
why<00:03:30.060> we<00:03:30.180> abstract<00:03:30.890> alright<00:03:31.890> and<00:03:32.160> I'll<00:03:32.310> show

00:03:32.570 --> 00:03:32.580 
why we abstract alright and I'll show

00:03:32.580 --> 00:03:35.930 
why we abstract alright and I'll show
you<00:03:32.610> a<00:03:32.760> better<00:03:33.120> way<00:03:33.739> not<00:03:34.739> and<00:03:34.980> they're<00:03:35.610> not<00:03:35.730> too

00:03:35.930 --> 00:03:35.940 
you a better way not and they're not too

00:03:35.940 --> 00:03:38.960 
you a better way not and they're not too
far<00:03:36.739> away<00:03:37.739> futures<00:03:38.340> not<00:03:38.550> the<00:03:38.610> right<00:03:38.730> way<00:03:38.850> of

00:03:38.960 --> 00:03:38.970 
far away futures not the right way of

00:03:38.970 --> 00:03:41.060 
far away futures not the right way of
saying<00:03:39.150> it<00:03:39.269> in<00:03:39.330> the<00:03:39.420> near<00:03:39.600> future<00:03:39.870> I'll<00:03:40.590> show

00:03:41.060 --> 00:03:41.070 
saying it in the near future I'll show

00:03:41.070 --> 00:03:42.710 
saying it in the near future I'll show
you<00:03:41.130> a<00:03:41.220> way<00:03:41.340> to<00:03:41.370> abstract<00:03:41.760> away<00:03:41.910> so<00:03:42.330> for<00:03:42.630> on

00:03:42.710 --> 00:03:42.720 
you a way to abstract away so for on

00:03:42.720 --> 00:03:44.960 
you a way to abstract away so for on
Windows<00:03:43.080> then<00:03:43.799> great<00:03:44.250> our<00:03:44.489> code<00:03:44.820> will<00:03:44.940> work

00:03:44.960 --> 00:03:44.970 
Windows then great our code will work

00:03:44.970 --> 00:03:46.729 
Windows then great our code will work
fine<00:03:45.299> on<00:03:45.330> windows<00:03:45.750> and<00:03:45.930> if<00:03:45.989> you<00:03:46.080> want<00:03:46.260> to<00:03:46.470> make

00:03:46.729 --> 00:03:46.739 
fine on windows and if you want to make

00:03:46.739 --> 00:03:50.180 
fine on windows and if you want to make
an<00:03:46.890> interface<00:03:47.100> that<00:03:48.060> adapts<00:03:48.360> to<00:03:49.070> some<00:03:50.070> other

00:03:50.180 --> 00:03:50.190 
an interface that adapts to some other

00:03:50.190 --> 00:03:51.590 
an interface that adapts to some other
platforms<00:03:50.670> that's<00:03:50.850> fine<00:03:51.030> as<00:03:51.180> well<00:03:51.269> but<00:03:51.450> for

00:03:51.590 --> 00:03:51.600 
platforms that's fine as well but for

00:03:51.600 --> 00:03:53.150 
platforms that's fine as well but for
now<00:03:51.690> we're<00:03:52.260> going<00:03:52.290> primitive<00:03:52.890> because<00:03:53.070> I

00:03:53.150 --> 00:03:53.160 
now we're going primitive because I

00:03:53.160 --> 00:03:55.640 
now we're going primitive because I
think<00:03:53.220> it's<00:03:53.459> it's<00:03:54.330> easier<00:03:55.110> to<00:03:55.200> learn<00:03:55.320> that<00:03:55.500> way

00:03:55.640 --> 00:03:55.650 
think it's it's easier to learn that way

00:03:55.650 --> 00:03:57.860 
think it's it's easier to learn that way
so<00:03:55.709> how<00:03:56.040> are<00:03:56.100> we<00:03:56.130> gonna<00:03:56.280> do<00:03:56.370> that<00:03:56.400> first<00:03:56.700> I<00:03:57.060> no

00:03:57.860 --> 00:03:57.870 
so how are we gonna do that first I no

00:03:57.870 --> 00:03:59.990 
so how are we gonna do that first I no
longer<00:03:58.080> want<00:03:58.440> the<00:03:58.830> event<00:03:59.130> model<00:03:59.340> I<00:03:59.549> want<00:03:59.790> to

00:03:59.990 --> 00:04:00.000 
longer want the event model I want to

00:04:00.000 --> 00:04:02.180 
longer want the event model I want to
pull<00:04:00.420> for<00:04:00.690> it<00:04:00.780> in<00:04:00.900> the<00:04:00.989> update<00:04:01.410> and<00:04:01.620> I<00:04:02.010> don't

00:04:02.180 --> 00:04:02.190 
pull for it in the update and I don't

00:04:02.190 --> 00:04:03.740 
pull for it in the update and I don't
want<00:04:02.310> my<00:04:02.400> update<00:04:02.730> function<00:04:03.090> to<00:04:03.180> get<00:04:03.330> too<00:04:03.480> big

00:04:03.740 --> 00:04:03.750 
want my update function to get too big

00:04:03.750 --> 00:04:07.039 
want my update function to get too big
so<00:04:04.049> what<00:04:04.500> we're<00:04:04.680> gonna<00:04:04.769> do<00:04:05.570> here<00:04:06.570> is<00:04:06.630> I'm<00:04:06.840> gonna

00:04:07.039 --> 00:04:07.049 
so what we're gonna do here is I'm gonna

00:04:07.049 --> 00:04:13.580 
so what we're gonna do here is I'm gonna
say<00:04:08.510> check<00:04:11.180> check<00:04:12.180> key<00:04:12.480> state<00:04:12.840> how<00:04:13.230> about<00:04:13.410> that

00:04:13.580 --> 00:04:13.590 
say check check key state how about that

00:04:13.590 --> 00:04:17.420 
say check check key state how about that
we'll<00:04:13.890> make<00:04:14.880> our<00:04:15.030> own<00:04:15.239> function<00:04:15.840> copy<00:04:16.650> that<00:04:17.040> go

00:04:17.420 --> 00:04:17.430 
we'll make our own function copy that go

00:04:17.430 --> 00:04:19.219 
we'll make our own function copy that go
to<00:04:17.489> the<00:04:17.640> header<00:04:17.790> file<00:04:18.090> I'm<00:04:18.690> gonna<00:04:18.870> make<00:04:19.019> that<00:04:19.169> a

00:04:19.219 --> 00:04:19.229 
to the header file I'm gonna make that a

00:04:19.229 --> 00:04:21.979 
to the header file I'm gonna make that a
private<00:04:20.180> function<00:04:21.180> right

00:04:21.979 --> 00:04:21.989 
private function right

00:04:21.989 --> 00:04:26.029 
private function right
oops<00:04:22.830> said<00:04:23.610> void<00:04:23.930> and<00:04:24.930> so<00:04:25.530> we're<00:04:25.650> gonna<00:04:25.800> check

00:04:26.029 --> 00:04:26.039 
oops said void and so we're gonna check

00:04:26.039 --> 00:04:28.309 
oops said void and so we're gonna check
the<00:04:26.220> key<00:04:26.430> state<00:04:26.789> and<00:04:27.150> then<00:04:27.690> we'll<00:04:27.870> ready<00:04:28.050> paint

00:04:28.309 --> 00:04:28.319 
the key state and then we'll ready paint

00:04:28.319 --> 00:04:30.499 
the key state and then we'll ready paint
so<00:04:28.560> then<00:04:28.770> here<00:04:29.520> I'm<00:04:29.610> gonna<00:04:29.759> rename<00:04:30.150> this<00:04:30.330> to

00:04:30.499 --> 00:04:30.509 
so then here I'm gonna rename this to

00:04:30.509 --> 00:04:33.379 
so then here I'm gonna rename this to
check<00:04:30.840> Keys<00:04:31.770> State<00:04:32.220> get<00:04:32.639> rid<00:04:32.759> of<00:04:32.819> our<00:04:32.940> argument

00:04:33.379 --> 00:04:33.389 
check Keys State get rid of our argument

00:04:33.389 --> 00:04:37.640 
check Keys State get rid of our argument
here<00:04:33.449> and<00:04:34.880> we<00:04:35.880> no<00:04:36.060> longer<00:04:36.120> need<00:04:37.050> this<00:04:37.289> because

00:04:37.640 --> 00:04:37.650 
here and we no longer need this because

00:04:37.650 --> 00:04:39.050 
here and we no longer need this because
we're<00:04:37.770> not<00:04:37.889> going<00:04:38.099> to<00:04:38.190> use<00:04:38.250> the<00:04:38.490> event<00:04:38.759> model

00:04:39.050 --> 00:04:39.060 
we're not going to use the event model

00:04:39.060 --> 00:04:42.100 
we're not going to use the event model
and<00:04:39.539> I<00:04:40.319> think<00:04:40.620> we're<00:04:41.009> looking<00:04:41.430> a<00:04:41.490> little<00:04:41.580> good

00:04:42.100 --> 00:04:42.110 
and I think we're looking a little good

00:04:42.110 --> 00:04:44.839 
and I think we're looking a little good
except<00:04:43.110> now<00:04:43.229> we<00:04:43.289> don't<00:04:43.440> have<00:04:43.590> e<00:04:43.979> all<00:04:44.490> right<00:04:44.610> we

00:04:47.600 --> 00:04:47.610 
have to pull you have to ask windows hey

00:04:47.610 --> 00:04:51.890 
have to pull you have to ask windows hey
help<00:04:48.330> us<00:04:48.419> here<00:04:49.819> all<00:04:50.819> right<00:04:50.940> so<00:04:51.180> how<00:04:51.630> do<00:04:51.690> we<00:04:51.780> do

00:04:51.890 --> 00:04:51.900

that let me show you

00:04:54.289 --> 00:04:57.170 
that let me show you
instead<00:04:55.289> of<00:04:55.409> saying<00:04:55.680> e<00:04:55.979> key<00:04:56.639> here<00:04:56.940> key<00:04:56.970> uh

00:04:57.170 --> 00:04:57.180 
instead of saying e key here key uh

00:04:57.180 --> 00:05:00.110 
instead of saying e key here key uh
we're<00:04:57.720> gonna<00:04:57.810> replace<00:04:58.110> this<00:04:58.349> with<00:04:58.590> get<00:04:58.889> a<00:04:59.130> sync

00:05:00.110 --> 00:05:00.120 
we're gonna replace this with get a sync

00:05:00.120 --> 00:05:04.640 
we're gonna replace this with get a sync
key<00:05:00.810> State<00:05:01.729> VK<00:05:02.729> and<00:05:03.240> again<00:05:03.990> there's<00:05:04.229> some<00:05:04.470> mean

00:05:04.640 --> 00:05:04.650 
key State VK and again there's some mean

00:05:04.650 --> 00:05:07.370 
key State VK and again there's some mean
I'm<00:05:04.830> prefixing<00:05:05.550> they're<00:05:05.759> just<00:05:06.030> name<00:05:06.720> spaces

00:05:07.370 --> 00:05:07.380 
I'm prefixing they're just name spaces

00:05:07.380 --> 00:05:11.140 
I'm prefixing they're just name spaces
namespace<00:05:08.250> clashing<00:05:08.819> I'm<00:05:08.940> gonna<00:05:09.090> say<00:05:09.650> VK<00:05:10.650> up

00:05:11.140 --> 00:05:11.150 
namespace clashing I'm gonna say VK up

00:05:11.150 --> 00:05:14.870 
namespace clashing I'm gonna say VK up
all<00:05:12.150> right<00:05:12.330> and<00:05:12.620> if<00:05:13.620> you<00:05:13.740> notice<00:05:14.039> get<00:05:14.340> a<00:05:14.520> sync

00:05:14.870 --> 00:05:14.880 
all right and if you notice get a sync

00:05:14.880 --> 00:05:19.129 
all right and if you notice get a sync
key<00:05:15.120> stake<00:05:15.449> it<00:05:15.750> in<00:05:16.409> state<00:05:17.840> I'm<00:05:18.840> gonna<00:05:18.990> bring

00:05:19.129 --> 00:05:19.139 
key stake it in state I'm gonna bring

00:05:19.139 --> 00:05:23.210 
key stake it in state I'm gonna bring
this<00:05:19.289> back<00:05:19.500> up<00:05:19.819> it<00:05:20.819> returns<00:05:21.360> a<00:05:21.930> short<00:05:22.500> which

00:05:23.210 --> 00:05:23.220 
this back up it returns a short which

00:05:23.220 --> 00:05:24.860 
this back up it returns a short which
essentially<00:05:23.849> we're<00:05:24.330> gonna<00:05:24.479> treat<00:05:24.690> like<00:05:24.840> a

00:05:24.860 --> 00:05:24.870 
essentially we're gonna treat like a

00:05:24.870 --> 00:05:27.770 
essentially we're gonna treat like a
boolean<00:05:25.289> at<00:05:25.440> 0<00:05:25.770> if<00:05:26.639> we<00:05:26.820> get<00:05:26.940> 0<00:05:27.210> back<00:05:27.419> that<00:05:27.630> means

00:05:27.770 --> 00:05:27.780 
boolean at 0 if we get 0 back that means

00:05:27.780 --> 00:05:29.570 
boolean at 0 if we get 0 back that means
the<00:05:27.900> key<00:05:28.080> is<00:05:28.199> not<00:05:28.380> pressed<00:05:28.650> anything<00:05:29.070> else

00:05:29.570 --> 00:05:29.580 
the key is not pressed anything else

00:05:29.580 --> 00:05:31.939 
the key is not pressed anything else
it<00:05:29.759> is<00:05:29.940> Preston<00:05:30.479> and<00:05:30.750> integers<00:05:31.620> can<00:05:31.889> be

00:05:31.939 --> 00:05:31.949 
it is Preston and integers can be

00:05:31.949 --> 00:05:34.999 
it is Preston and integers can be
interpreted<00:05:32.490> as<00:05:32.580> boolean<00:05:32.729> that<00:05:32.969> way<00:05:33.300> so<00:05:34.009> if

00:05:34.999 --> 00:05:35.009 
interpreted as boolean that way so if

00:05:35.009 --> 00:05:37.100 
interpreted as boolean that way so if
it's<00:05:35.219> up<00:05:35.370> then<00:05:35.940> we<00:05:36.030> want<00:05:36.210> to<00:05:36.270> do<00:05:36.360> that<00:05:36.539> then

00:05:37.100 --> 00:05:37.110 
it's up then we want to do that then

00:05:37.110 --> 00:05:46.450 
it's up then we want to do that then
down<00:05:37.349> here<00:05:40.099> get<00:05:41.099> a<00:05:41.370> sync<00:05:41.880> key<00:05:42.360> state<00:05:43.159> VK<00:05:44.570> down

00:05:46.450 --> 00:05:46.460 
down here get a sync key state VK down

00:05:46.460 --> 00:05:48.980 
down here get a sync key state VK down
and<00:05:47.460> we're<00:05:47.849> gonna<00:05:47.969> pause<00:05:48.270> the<00:05:48.449> recording<00:05:48.479> so

00:05:48.980 --> 00:05:48.990 
and we're gonna pause the recording so

00:05:48.990 --> 00:05:50.209 
and we're gonna pause the recording so
you<00:05:49.020> don't<00:05:49.199> have<00:05:49.289> to<00:05:49.409> painfully<00:05:49.830> watch<00:05:50.009> me

00:05:50.209 --> 00:05:50.219 
you don't have to painfully watch me

00:05:50.219 --> 00:05:53.480 
you don't have to painfully watch me

the West we have left and right now
we're<00:05:56.340> gonna<00:05:56.430> check<00:05:56.699> key<00:05:56.969> state<00:05:57.300> we're<00:05:58.199> gonna

00:05:58.279 --> 00:05:58.289 
we're gonna check key state we're gonna

00:05:58.289 --> 00:06:00.620 
we're gonna check key state we're gonna
do<00:05:58.500> that<00:05:58.620> every<00:05:58.770> update<00:05:59.190> so<00:05:59.580> 12<00:06:00.060> 5<00:06:00.270> let's<00:06:00.569> see

what happens boom here we go right left
you<00:06:05.849> see<00:06:06.000> we're<00:06:06.120> not<00:06:06.180> pausing<00:06:06.569> anymore

00:06:07.040 --> 00:06:07.050 
you see we're not pausing anymore

right left we immediately go the

00:06:09.659 --> 00:06:12.140 
right left we immediately go the
direction<00:06:10.020> I<00:06:10.080> tell<00:06:10.289> it<00:06:10.380> to<00:06:10.440> up<00:06:11.250> down<00:06:11.699> now<00:06:11.969> let's

00:06:12.140 --> 00:06:12.150 
direction I tell it to up down now let's

direction I tell it to up down now let's
try<00:06:12.270> to<00:06:12.300> go<00:06:12.479> to<00:06:12.539> directions<00:06:13.110> at<00:06:13.259> the<00:06:13.289> same<00:06:13.380> time

00:06:13.700 --> 00:06:13.710 
try to go to directions at the same time

00:06:13.710 --> 00:06:16.219 
try to go to directions at the same time
left<00:06:13.949> and<00:06:14.069> right<00:06:14.219> or<00:06:14.430> left<00:06:14.819> and<00:06:15.000> up<00:06:15.120> hey<00:06:16.020> look

00:06:16.219 --> 00:06:16.229 
left and right or left and up hey look

00:06:16.229 --> 00:06:16.640 
left and right or left and up hey look
at<00:06:16.319> that

00:06:16.640 --> 00:06:16.650 
at that

00:06:16.650 --> 00:06:19.909 
at that
diagonal<00:06:17.159> that's<00:06:17.639> kind<00:06:17.909> of<00:06:17.969> cool<00:06:18.620> alright<00:06:19.620> and

00:06:19.909 --> 00:06:19.919 
diagonal that's kind of cool alright and

00:06:19.919 --> 00:06:22.309 
diagonal that's kind of cool alright and
that<00:06:20.009> wasn't<00:06:20.159> too<00:06:20.370> hard<00:06:20.580> to<00:06:20.669> do<00:06:20.789> that's<00:06:21.319> that's

00:06:22.309 --> 00:06:22.319 
that wasn't too hard to do that's that's

00:06:22.319 --> 00:06:24.110 
that wasn't too hard to do that's that's
all<00:06:23.159> we<00:06:23.250> had<00:06:23.340> to<00:06:23.430> do<00:06:23.490> was<00:06:23.639> pull<00:06:23.819> we're<00:06:24.000> just

00:06:24.110 --> 00:06:24.120 
all we had to do was pull we're just

00:06:24.120 --> 00:06:25.370 
all we had to do was pull we're just
saying<00:06:24.240> hey<00:06:24.360> is<00:06:24.479> the<00:06:24.569> key<00:06:24.750> down<00:06:24.870> is<00:06:25.050> key<00:06:25.229> down

00:06:25.370 --> 00:06:25.380 
saying hey is the key down is key down

00:06:25.380 --> 00:06:27.760 
saying hey is the key down is key down
we're<00:06:25.560> gonna<00:06:25.620> move<00:06:26.310> the<00:06:26.460> ship<00:06:26.639> accordingly

00:06:27.760 --> 00:06:27.770 
we're gonna move the ship accordingly

00:06:27.770 --> 00:06:34.110 
we're gonna move the ship accordingly
all<00:06:28.770> right<00:06:29.009> so<00:06:31.580> what's<00:06:32.580> next<00:06:33.029> well

00:06:34.110 --> 00:06:34.120 
all right so what's next well

00:06:34.120 --> 00:06:37.800 
all right so what's next well
I<00:06:34.260> think<00:06:35.260> for<00:06:35.530> now<00:06:36.210> we're<00:06:37.210> gonna<00:06:37.360> we're<00:06:37.780> just

00:06:37.800 --> 00:06:37.810 
I think for now we're gonna we're just

00:06:37.810 --> 00:06:40.650 
I think for now we're gonna we're just
gonna<00:06:38.050> keep<00:06:38.290> this<00:06:38.760> couple<00:06:39.760> code<00:06:40.030> to<00:06:40.240> Windows

00:06:40.650 --> 00:06:40.660 
gonna keep this couple code to Windows

00:06:40.660 --> 00:06:42.689 
gonna keep this couple code to Windows
and<00:06:40.960> then<00:06:41.020> in<00:06:41.229> a<00:06:41.470> few<00:06:41.830> videos<00:06:42.190> I'll<00:06:42.400> show<00:06:42.430> you

00:06:42.689 --> 00:06:42.699 
and then in a few videos I'll show you

00:06:42.699 --> 00:06:44.550 
and then in a few videos I'll show you
how<00:06:42.820> to<00:06:42.850> abstract<00:06:43.690> that<00:06:43.870> away<00:06:44.110> to<00:06:44.169> something<00:06:44.530> a

00:06:44.550 --> 00:06:44.560 
how to abstract that away to something a

00:06:44.560 --> 00:06:47.370 
how to abstract that away to something a
little<00:06:44.740> more<00:06:44.800> elegant<00:06:45.669> but<00:06:45.850> but<00:06:46.570> I<00:06:46.600> noticed

00:06:47.370 --> 00:06:47.380 
little more elegant but but I noticed

00:06:47.380 --> 00:06:49.980 
little more elegant but but I noticed
our<00:06:47.560> ship<00:06:47.860> here<00:06:48.220> I<00:06:48.460> mean<00:06:49.210> I<00:06:49.240> go<00:06:49.449> laughing<00:06:49.690> go

00:06:49.980 --> 00:06:49.990 
our ship here I mean I go laughing go

00:06:49.990 --> 00:06:51.300 
our ship here I mean I go laughing go
laughter<00:06:50.199> it's<00:06:50.530> kind<00:06:50.680> of<00:06:50.800> like<00:06:50.919> a<00:06:50.949> geometry

00:06:51.300 --> 00:06:51.310 
laughter it's kind of like a geometry

00:06:51.310 --> 00:06:53.159 
laughter it's kind of like a geometry
wars<00:06:51.760> control<00:06:52.330> scheme<00:06:52.600> if<00:06:52.780> you<00:06:52.870> ever<00:06:52.990> play

00:06:55.379 --> 00:06:55.389 
geometry wars basically the ship goes

geometry wars basically the ship goes
immediately<00:06:55.690> where<00:06:56.050> you<00:06:56.139> tell<00:06:56.350> it<00:06:56.380> to

immediately where you tell it to
whereas<00:06:57.250> asteroids<00:06:57.760> if<00:06:57.970> you<00:06:58.090> push<00:06:58.300> up<00:06:58.510> it

00:06:58.860 --> 00:06:58.870 
whereas asteroids if you push up it

00:06:58.870 --> 00:07:00.930 
whereas asteroids if you push up it
thrusts<00:06:59.380> up<00:06:59.560> and<00:06:59.889> it<00:06:59.949> keeps<00:07:00.130> moving<00:07:00.370> up<00:07:00.639> and<00:07:00.850> up

00:07:00.930 --> 00:07:00.940 
thrusts up and it keeps moving up and up

thrusts up and it keeps moving up and up
and<00:07:01.060> up<00:07:01.150> until<00:07:01.360> you<00:07:01.660> turn<00:07:02.229> the<00:07:02.350> ship<00:07:02.500> around

and tell it to thrust the other

00:07:03.880 --> 00:07:05.430 
and tell it to thrust the other
direction<00:07:04.180> and<00:07:04.540> so<00:07:04.720> on<00:07:04.750> and<00:07:04.990> so<00:07:05.110> forth<00:07:05.350> so

direction and so on and so forth so
right<00:07:06.160> now<00:07:06.280> we<00:07:06.340> have<00:07:06.520> a<00:07:06.550> very<00:07:06.729> geometry<00:07:07.660> wars

00:07:07.830 --> 00:07:07.840 
right now we have a very geometry wars

00:07:07.840 --> 00:07:09.540 
right now we have a very geometry wars
type<00:07:08.139> of<00:07:08.260> control<00:07:08.560> which<00:07:08.770> is<00:07:08.919> the<00:07:09.100> if<00:07:09.340> that's

00:07:09.540 --> 00:07:09.550 
type of control which is the if that's

00:07:09.550 --> 00:07:11.610 
type of control which is the if that's
the<00:07:09.789> control<00:07:10.030> staining<00:07:10.419> scheme<00:07:10.780> that<00:07:11.500> you're

00:07:11.610 --> 00:07:11.620 
the control staining scheme that you're

00:07:11.620 --> 00:07:13.830 
the control staining scheme that you're
going<00:07:11.889> for<00:07:12.100> then<00:07:12.280> great<00:07:12.580> but<00:07:12.850> if<00:07:13.510> you<00:07:13.660> want

00:07:13.830 --> 00:07:13.840 
going for then great but if you want

00:07:13.840 --> 00:07:16.290 
going for then great but if you want
this<00:07:13.960> to<00:07:14.020> be<00:07:14.199> more<00:07:14.380> asteroids<00:07:14.949> ish<00:07:15.310> or<00:07:15.610> the

00:07:16.290 --> 00:07:16.300 
this to be more asteroids ish or the

00:07:16.300 --> 00:07:18.540 
this to be more asteroids ish or the
ship<00:07:16.510> actually<00:07:16.930> rotates<00:07:17.800> when<00:07:18.070> you<00:07:18.160> push<00:07:18.340> left

00:07:18.540 --> 00:07:18.550 
ship actually rotates when you push left

00:07:18.550 --> 00:07:20.310 
ship actually rotates when you push left
and<00:07:18.760> right<00:07:18.910> and<00:07:19.180> keeps<00:07:19.690> going<00:07:20.020> the<00:07:20.139> way<00:07:20.169> you

00:07:20.310 --> 00:07:20.320 
and right and keeps going the way you

00:07:20.320 --> 00:07:24.120 
and right and keeps going the way you
thrust<00:07:20.710> it<00:07:20.919> then<00:07:22.440> then<00:07:23.440> we<00:07:23.560> needed<00:07:23.740> to<00:07:23.919> make

00:07:24.120 --> 00:07:24.130 
thrust it then then we needed to make

00:07:24.130 --> 00:07:25.950 
thrust it then then we needed to make
some<00:07:24.280> changes<00:07:24.310> in<00:07:24.820> and<00:07:25.000> those<00:07:25.419> changes<00:07:25.810> I

00:07:25.950 --> 00:07:25.960 
some changes in and those changes I

00:07:25.960 --> 00:07:28.830 
some changes in and those changes I
think<00:07:26.260> are<00:07:26.380> good<00:07:26.590> the<00:07:26.919> next<00:07:27.039> best<00:07:27.880> educational

00:07:28.830 --> 00:07:28.840 
think are good the next best educational

00:07:28.840 --> 00:07:31.770 
think are good the next best educational
move<00:07:29.080> and<00:07:29.470> I<00:07:30.250> also<00:07:30.430> want<00:07:30.729> that<00:07:30.880> ship<00:07:31.150> to<00:07:31.389> rotate

00:07:31.770 --> 00:07:31.780 
move and I also want that ship to rotate

00:07:31.780 --> 00:07:32.969 
move and I also want that ship to rotate
and<00:07:31.960> turn<00:07:32.169> so<00:07:32.440> that's<00:07:32.650> what<00:07:32.740> we're<00:07:32.830> going<00:07:32.919> to

00:07:32.969 --> 00:07:32.979 
and turn so that's what we're going to

00:07:32.979 --> 00:07:35.190 
and turn so that's what we're going to
do
