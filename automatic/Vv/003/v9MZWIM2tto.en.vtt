00:01:38.510 --> 00:01:38.520 
and then fluffy but still even so let's

00:01:38.520 --> 00:01:40.640 
and then fluffy but still even so let's
process<00:01:38.970> iron<00:01:39.360> off<00:01:39.540> about<00:01:39.810> maybe<00:01:39.990> five<00:01:40.320> to<00:01:40.470> ten

00:01:40.640 --> 00:01:40.650 
process iron off about maybe five to ten

00:01:40.650 --> 00:01:54.090

00:01:56.620 --> 00:01:56.630 
and this is the consistency that we're

00:01:56.630 --> 00:01:58.569 
and this is the consistency that we're
looking<00:01:56.780> for<00:01:57.020> we<00:01:57.710> really<00:01:58.039> want<00:01:58.250> for<00:01:58.460> our

00:01:58.569 --> 00:01:58.579 
looking for we really want for our

00:01:58.579 --> 00:02:00.969 
looking for we really want for our
mixture<00:01:58.969> to<00:01:59.119> be<00:01:59.299> a<00:01:59.479> little<00:02:00.200> bit<00:02:00.409> more<00:02:00.680> chunky

00:02:00.969 --> 00:02:00.979 
mixture to be a little bit more chunky

00:02:00.979 --> 00:02:03.789 
mixture to be a little bit more chunky
than<00:02:01.490> almond<00:02:02.000> flour<00:02:02.329> so<00:02:02.899> that<00:02:03.049> you<00:02:03.140> can<00:02:03.289> see<00:02:03.560> a

00:02:03.789 --> 00:02:03.799 
than almond flour so that you can see a

00:02:03.799 --> 00:02:06.370 
than almond flour so that you can see a
little<00:02:04.130> bit<00:02:04.340> of<00:02:04.399> the<00:02:04.579> almond<00:02:05.090> pieces<00:02:05.329> in<00:02:05.840> there

00:02:06.370 --> 00:02:06.380 
little bit of the almond pieces in there

00:02:06.380 --> 00:02:08.380 
little bit of the almond pieces in there
but<00:02:06.979> yet<00:02:07.189> it<00:02:07.280> won't<00:02:07.460> get<00:02:07.670> in<00:02:07.820> our<00:02:07.939> way<00:02:07.970> when<00:02:08.300> we

00:02:08.380 --> 00:02:08.390 
but yet it won't get in our way when we

00:02:08.390 --> 00:02:09.609 
but yet it won't get in our way when we
go<00:02:08.479> to<00:02:08.539> cut<00:02:08.810> the<00:02:08.929> baklava

00:02:09.609 --> 00:02:09.619 
go to cut the baklava

00:02:09.619 --> 00:02:11.380 
go to cut the baklava
so<00:02:09.979> this<00:02:10.130> is<00:02:10.250> our<00:02:10.340> almond<00:02:10.640> filling<00:02:10.819> when<00:02:11.269> we

00:02:11.380 --> 00:02:11.390 
so this is our almond filling when we

00:02:11.390 --> 00:02:13.300 
so this is our almond filling when we
come<00:02:11.599> back<00:02:11.780> we're<00:02:12.080> going<00:02:12.230> to<00:02:12.319> clarify<00:02:12.860> butter

00:02:13.300 --> 00:02:13.310 
come back we're going to clarify butter

00:02:13.310 --> 00:02:16.120
