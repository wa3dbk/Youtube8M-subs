00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.069
 same androids as you are as you know 

00:00:02.639 --> 00:00:07.740
 the previous week took place in google 

00:00:05.069 --> 00:00:09.750
 imputed points that trains is about 

00:00:07.740 --> 00:00:12.509
 the most important conference of google 

00:00:09.750 --> 00:00:14.429
 focused on the developers in this 

00:00:12.509 --> 00:00:16.800
 conference were presented enough 

00:00:14.429 --> 00:00:18.570
 news on the one hand we are left without 

00:00:16.800 --> 00:00:21.869
 a new coastal nexus a new 

00:00:18.570 --> 00:00:23.789
 present today as it would be 4.3 or 5.0 

00:00:21.869 --> 00:00:25.980
 but instead there have been two great 

00:00:23.789 --> 00:00:28.019
 novelties focused especially on 

00:00:25.980 --> 00:00:29.910
 developers so they have a choice 

00:00:28.019 --> 00:00:32.430
 to create more applications and greater 

00:00:29.910 --> 00:00:34.620
 load for users one day before 

00:00:32.430 --> 00:00:37.050
 google input-output came a rumor that 

00:00:34.620 --> 00:00:39.090
 he said he would leave a ring his done with 

00:00:37.050 --> 00:00:42.000
 samsung and that we would continue like the 

00:00:39.090 --> 00:00:43.559
 galaxy 4 but big dark I have 

00:00:42.000 --> 00:00:45.210
 done one I did not want it but when 

00:00:43.559 --> 00:00:46.710
 I was watching in the direct streaming of 

00:00:45.210 --> 00:00:49.260
 google imputes auto 

00:00:46.710 --> 00:00:51.829
 the presenter took out of his pocket a 

00:00:49.260 --> 00:00:54.559
 samsung galaxy 4 and says 

00:00:51.829 --> 00:00:57.140
 this is possible and really everything is 

00:00:54.559 --> 00:00:59.030
 presented and showed the sancho six in 

00:00:57.140 --> 00:01:02.030
 four with a pure android interface 

00:00:59.030 --> 00:01:06.470
 and that is what you will ask a lexus a 

00:01:02.030 --> 00:01:11.420
 samsung well between both councils has 

00:01:06.470 --> 00:01:13.340
 The hardware of Samsung Galaxy S 4g is 

00:01:11.420 --> 00:01:15.710
 say share with the sant his sentences 

00:01:13.340 --> 00:01:18.740
 found all the specifications the 

00:01:15.710 --> 00:01:20.570
 screen the camera everything except in the 

00:01:18.740 --> 00:01:23.030
 operating system which what of the 

00:01:20.570 --> 00:01:24.319
 google product is we will find a 

00:01:23.030 --> 00:01:27.170
 experience annexes 

00:01:24.319 --> 00:01:29.360
 we have a pure layer of androids he 

00:01:27.170 --> 00:01:31.310
 without any customization and 

00:01:29.360 --> 00:01:32.720
 in addition all the updates will go 

00:01:31.310 --> 00:01:34.819
 direct from google 

00:01:32.720 --> 00:01:37.039
 the galaxy the pse 4 nexos will not count on 

00:01:34.819 --> 00:01:39.560
 intrusive alcabre personalization tower 

00:01:37.039 --> 00:01:41.479
 that is to say blood so it will not count 

00:01:39.560 --> 00:01:43.490
 with all the extra purposes that 

00:01:41.479 --> 00:01:45.170
 adds samsung as well as all those 

00:01:43.490 --> 00:01:47.420
 exclusive applications 

00:01:45.170 --> 00:01:49.250
 thanks to it the battery of programs and 

00:01:47.420 --> 00:01:52.100
 without doubting the internal memory available 

00:01:49.250 --> 00:01:54.939
 it will be quite superior we hope some 

00:01:52.100 --> 00:01:54.939
 two gigas 

00:02:00.070 --> 00:02:03.070
 49 

00:02:20.230 --> 00:02:23.230
 44 

00:02:28.540 --> 00:02:38.269
 the misfortunes to have it though samsung 

00:02:36.200 --> 00:02:43.910
 in that box it 's a bit special since 

00:02:38.269 --> 00:02:46.040
 it adds sensibilities seen to a 

00:02:43.910 --> 00:02:48.310
 portable device and all its 

00:02:46.040 --> 00:02:51.200
 functionalities 

00:02:48.310 --> 00:02:53.150
 it is better the swearing consolidation of 

00:02:51.200 --> 00:02:55.620
 Android to enter you have a lot 

00:02:53.150 --> 00:02:58.920
 less the 

00:02:55.620 --> 00:02:58.920
 much better 

00:02:59.610 --> 00:03:11.550
 with all the new functionalities of 

00:03:08.410 --> 00:03:11.550
 the postures 

00:03:11.770 --> 00:03:15.910
 and the reality at the same time that all 

00:03:14.950 --> 00:03:17.520
 the other blacks 

00:03:15.910 --> 00:03:20.560
 although here I want to make a clarification 

00:03:17.520 --> 00:03:23.140
 it's the same the samsung galaxy s 4g and 

00:03:20.560 --> 00:03:25.450
 nexus in fuck a samsung galaxy s 4 

00:03:23.140 --> 00:03:28.450
 for want to root it and put it 

00:03:25.450 --> 00:03:30.160
 cyanogenmod to usb or any kind of 

00:03:28.450 --> 00:03:32.860
 be robots that emulate the pure android 

00:03:30.160 --> 00:03:34.300
 but good 99% of users do not 

00:03:32.860 --> 00:03:36.430
 he knows what version of android he has 

00:03:34.300 --> 00:03:38.290
 now I will talk to you subjectively and 

00:03:36.430 --> 00:03:40.750
 I say that in my opinion the best mobile of 

00:03:38.290 --> 00:03:42.610
 the present is the galaxy s 4 nexos if 

00:03:40.750 --> 00:03:44.320
 we consider the hardware is the 

00:03:42.610 --> 00:03:46.450
 better not look for the top of the range 

00:03:44.320 --> 00:03:48.760
 samsung that has a duration of three 

00:03:46.450 --> 00:03:50.800
 screens the best cameras the best 

00:03:48.760 --> 00:03:52.480
 internal performance and if we talk about the 

00:03:50.800 --> 00:03:55.300
 software has the best that is the 

00:03:52.480 --> 00:03:56.890
 interface and pure android experience 

00:03:55.300 --> 00:03:58.630
 with all the new updates and 

00:03:56.890 --> 00:04:00.070
 this is something that no device in 

00:03:58.630 --> 00:04:02.050
 currently has for example if 

00:04:00.070 --> 00:04:04.180
 we have the best nexus ie the 

00:04:02.050 --> 00:04:05.920
 last in those four has the best 

00:04:04.180 --> 00:04:07.720
 software but the trees stays 

00:04:05.920 --> 00:04:09.970
 quite short considering the 

00:04:07.720 --> 00:04:12.630
 new ranges of today the only 

00:04:09.970 --> 00:04:12.630
 Negative point 

00:04:13.460 --> 00:04:20.050
 thinking that it is the same 

00:04:36.760 --> 00:04:44.890
 of the four in these they control a lot 

00:04:42.560 --> 00:04:44.890
 best 

00:04:50.350 --> 00:04:58.880
 to 649 dollars 

00:04:56.020 --> 00:05:00.560
 at the moment it is not known if it will be limited to 

00:04:58.880 --> 00:05:04.520
 united states which is quite 

00:05:00.560 --> 00:05:06.020
 possible to fly high a detail to have 

00:05:04.520 --> 00:05:08.930
 account is that at least in the countries 

00:05:06.020 --> 00:05:11.470
 where it is spoken will be 50 dollars more 

00:05:08.930 --> 00:05:15.199
 cheap at $ 40 for the both 

00:05:11.470 --> 00:05:17.300
 then very interesting that is true 

00:05:15.199 --> 00:05:19.490
 room with the nexus project on behalf of 

00:05:17.300 --> 00:05:21.560
 google from now the distortion 

00:05:19.490 --> 00:05:23.630
 to the slope away from a terminal already 

00:05:21.560 --> 00:05:25.009
 existing and with a normal version is 

00:05:23.630 --> 00:05:27.229
 something that until now had not had 

00:05:25.009 --> 00:05:31.810
 place so far I also had 

00:05:27.229 --> 00:05:31.810
 dried year after year a device 

00:05:42.470 --> 00:05:46.550
 the support to your different brands 

00:05:45.260 --> 00:05:49.070
 let's say that from now 

00:05:46.550 --> 00:05:52.100
 we will start to see range stops of each 

00:05:49.070 --> 00:05:53.900
 manufacturer with its nexus version though 

00:05:52.100 --> 00:05:56.300
 What I think will happen is that 

00:05:53.900 --> 00:05:57.830
 google will continue to manufacture annually is 

00:05:56.300 --> 00:05:59.960
 one and their seem for this year I think that 

00:05:57.830 --> 00:06:02.270
 they will leave in their five and of race 

00:05:59.960 --> 00:06:04.220
 identified rights to different 

00:06:02.270 --> 00:06:06.650
 models like for example nes and 4 or the 

00:06:04.220 --> 00:06:08.930
 possible latex model or this was that the 

00:06:06.650 --> 00:06:11.690
 projects around the world has a 

00:06:08.930 --> 00:06:14.480
 wide repertoire of devices with 

00:06:11.690 --> 00:06:16.820
 great features and nexus software is 

00:06:14.480 --> 00:06:18.890
 saying this is something that would really be 

00:06:16.820 --> 00:06:20.600
 really good for all the people and 

00:06:18.890 --> 00:06:23.060
 they would also be let's say a little more 

00:06:20.600 --> 00:06:25.040
 cheap that the official price that yes there 

00:06:23.060 --> 00:06:26.570
 to keep in mind that the nexus never 

00:06:25.040 --> 00:06:28.520
 they have had publicity and they are never going to 

00:06:26.570 --> 00:06:29.690
 have for example three and four months not 

00:06:28.520 --> 00:06:32.270
 you will never see him in a match 

00:06:29.690 --> 00:06:33.740
 advertising and a pro TV for people 

00:06:32.270 --> 00:06:35.480
 that is a little of the subject is really 

00:06:33.740 --> 00:06:38.000
 something that you have to take into account and 

00:06:35.480 --> 00:06:40.010
 well today androids video I hope that 

00:06:38.000 --> 00:06:42.470

00:06:40.010 --> 00:06:45.980
 opinion in the comments if you prefer 

00:06:42.470 --> 00:06:47.600
 in that normal box tell me or the c4 

00:06:45.980 --> 00:06:49.630
 visual google and for 

00:06:47.600 --> 00:06:52.160

 help the community by android to 

00:06:57.440 --> 00:07:01.250
 keep growing day after day until the 

00:06:59.330 --> 00:07:02.600
 next droids in cago in the whore is 

00:07:01.250 --> 00:07:07.030
 that because it has to be this green and 

00:07:02.600 --> 00:07:07.030
 the green letters are valid for the layperson
