 trainings in this video lesson we will see 

00:00:09.600 --> 00:00:13.379
 how to create a virtual machine on 

00:00:11.129 --> 00:00:15.480
 virtualbox to perform the installation 

00:00:13.379 --> 00:00:18.330
 from windows server 2012 

00:00:15.480 --> 00:00:21.660
 so let's go to the workforce or click here 

00:00:18.330 --> 00:00:26.220
 in virtualbox in new I'll give a name 

00:00:21.660 --> 00:00:27.839
 for my bad brain machine 2012 

00:00:26.220 --> 00:00:31.560
 can give the name you want 

00:00:27.839 --> 00:00:35.880
 the eac type microsoft windows version as 

00:00:31.560 --> 00:00:37.290
 select windows 2012 64-bit 

00:00:35.880 --> 00:00:39.480
 remembering that you have to have the 

00:00:37.290 --> 00:00:41.370
 driver box updated to the latest 

00:00:39.480 --> 00:00:42.840
 versions of the virtualbox to appear 

00:00:41.370 --> 00:00:44.850
 here in 2012 

00:00:42.840 --> 00:00:47.930
 is your version of the boxer motor more 

00:00:44.850 --> 00:00:51.150
 and please upgrade this version 

00:00:47.930 --> 00:00:52.650
 click on next 

00:00:51.150 --> 00:00:55.140
 he already said that it is also recommended 

00:00:52.650 --> 00:00:57.780
 2 gigabytes of memory I'll leave the 

00:00:55.140 --> 00:01:02.730
 keep the two gigabytes here if you have 

00:00:57.780 --> 00:01:05.369
 more memory better in close and he 

00:01:02.730 --> 00:01:07.530
 recommends using a 25g disc of the season 

00:01:05.369 --> 00:01:08.820
 We 'll increase this, I'll go. 

00:01:07.530 --> 00:01:13.020
 mark create a virtual hard disk 

00:01:08.820 --> 00:01:14.820
 now create 

00:01:13.020 --> 00:01:18.600
 I'll use the same pattern yourself. 

00:01:14.820 --> 00:01:21.149
 virtualbox click on next I will leave 

00:01:18.600 --> 00:01:26.039
 dynamically allocated click on next 

00:01:21.149 --> 00:01:29.249
 and the 25-gb disk or increase to 60 

00:01:26.039 --> 00:01:31.950
 giga tÃ¡ 60 gb a good size gives it 

00:01:29.249 --> 00:01:35.060
 works at minus 60 gb but here at 

00:01:31.950 --> 00:01:38.850
 our purpose will be a 60g disc 

00:01:35.060 --> 00:01:40.829
 click create beauty virtual machine 

00:01:38.850 --> 00:01:41.579
 was created successfully here under the 

00:01:40.829 --> 00:01:45.780
 my list 

00:01:41.579 --> 00:01:49.700
 now I go in settings and I'm going to do 

00:01:45.780 --> 00:01:52.079
 adjustments in the system. 

00:01:49.700 --> 00:01:55.319
 Uncheck Floppy Diskette Down 

00:01:52.079 --> 00:01:56.130
 because I will not use a floppy disk or 

00:01:55.319 --> 00:01:58.409
 monitor 

00:01:56.130 --> 00:02:01.170
 it is already set to 128 mega 

00:01:58.409 --> 00:02:04.109
 Video to enough 

00:02:01.170 --> 00:02:06.299
 the audio will leave the network is 

00:02:04.109 --> 00:02:07.829
 enabled but is connected to nati 

00:02:06.299 --> 00:02:09.509
 internet I want to board in bridge mode 

00:02:07.829 --> 00:02:11.520
 so that he can communicate with the 

00:02:09.509 --> 00:02:13.750
 my computer's normal network band 

00:02:11.520 --> 00:02:16.870
 my other devices 

00:02:13.750 --> 00:02:19.720
 I go in storage here. 

00:02:16.870 --> 00:02:21.940
 see that my cd is empty I'm going to click 

00:02:19.720 --> 00:02:25.210
 in your drawing and I will select a 

00:02:21.940 --> 00:02:28.720
 virtual cd or dvd file 

00:02:25.210 --> 00:02:31.860
 Until my peace I had time I already have 

00:02:28.720 --> 00:02:35.800
 that the use of windows server in Portuguese 

00:02:31.860 --> 00:02:38.350
 open I 'm going to use this so just 

00:02:35.800 --> 00:02:40.150
 click ok now and the virtual machine 

00:02:38.350 --> 00:02:42.850
 is created 

00:02:40.150 --> 00:02:44.860
 you can also use a cd if you have 

00:02:42.850 --> 00:02:46.600
 windows 7 dvd you use 

00:02:44.860 --> 00:02:48.790
 directly on dvd I prefer to use the 

00:02:46.600 --> 00:02:51.580
 iso image because it is faster 

00:02:48.790 --> 00:02:52.720
 legal installation , then the 

00:02:51.580 --> 00:02:55.420
 virtual machine 

00:02:52.720 --> 00:02:56.110
 now we will install the 

00:02:55.420 --> 00:02:57.489
 system 

00:02:56.110 --> 00:03:00.160
 only this was done in the next 

00:02:57.489 --> 00:03:01.330
