00:00:08.480 --> 00:00:12.349
 that everyone then has today 

00:00:10.250 --> 00:00:14.449
 I'm coming back with a little tutorial on 

00:00:12.349 --> 00:00:16.099
 how do I live eye liner so I know 

00:00:14.449 --> 00:00:17.869
 that it is not necessarily weighed down for everything 

00:00:16.099 --> 00:00:19.460
 the world and in my last video you 

00:00:17.869 --> 00:00:20.870
 have been many to ask me my 

00:00:19.460 --> 00:00:22.300
 trip had already done nothing 

00:00:20.870 --> 00:00:24.160
 when I have it 

00:00:22.300 --> 00:00:26.080
 but I think a little abet did 

00:00:24.160 --> 00:00:27.880
 of course, the whole video is longer 

00:00:26.080 --> 00:00:29.470
 so there it is shorter proposes 

00:00:27.880 --> 00:00:30.699
 techniques for applying standards 

00:00:29.470 --> 00:00:32.739
 after what you have to know 

00:00:30.699 --> 00:00:34.600
 really as time goes by 

00:00:32.739 --> 00:00:36.070
 will go every single month like all the 

00:00:34.600 --> 00:00:38.350
 I galley world both once I 

00:00:36.070 --> 00:00:39.070
 can not do it here I've put a little bit 

00:00:38.350 --> 00:00:41.769
 time too 

00:00:39.070 --> 00:00:44.260
 but here it goes all over there 

00:00:41.769 --> 00:00:45.010
 this one I imported wet for this 

00:00:44.260 --> 00:00:46.900
 not important 

00:00:45.010 --> 00:00:48.699
 if you're interested 

00:00:46.900 --> 00:00:50.140
 stayed to see the video if I had 

00:00:48.699 --> 00:00:51.540
 not interested we can go 

00:00:50.140 --> 00:00:54.340
 see another of my videos 

00:00:51.540 --> 00:00:56.379
 so here I am some products 

00:00:54.340 --> 00:00:59.129
 in addition to the liner but you do 

00:00:56.379 --> 00:00:59.129
 like you want 

00:01:00.150 --> 00:01:03.990
 for those who are not very comfortable 

00:01:01.740 --> 00:01:05.520
 I propose you to trace at the beginning with 

00:01:03.990 --> 00:01:08.850
 a little pencil your line but 

00:01:05.520 --> 00:01:10.530
 obviously it's optional have made sure 

00:01:08.850 --> 00:01:11.910
 remove the surplus of products that can 

00:01:10.530 --> 00:01:13.890
 stand on your brush so 

00:01:11.910 --> 00:01:16.440
 to avoid big pies on the eye after 

00:01:13.890 --> 00:01:18.000
 we start with the middle of the eye and then 

00:01:16.440 --> 00:01:20.730
 we are slowly returning to 

00:01:18.000 --> 00:01:24.080
 inside and finally does not arrange the trade 

00:01:20.730 --> 00:01:27.470
 very slowly take your time 

00:01:24.080 --> 00:01:27.470
 second technique 

00:01:27.700 --> 00:01:32.170
 so here we will draw small strokes 

00:01:30.130 --> 00:01:33.789
 very slowly and in the end we will 

00:01:32.170 --> 00:01:36.520
 connect like that you take your time 

00:01:33.789 --> 00:01:39.409
 is yours and close to the lashes and that 

00:01:36.520 --> 00:01:41.299
 will do a nice job 

00:01:39.409 --> 00:01:43.450
 then put away your trait 

00:01:41.299 --> 00:01:45.820
 the desired thickness 

00:01:43.450 --> 00:01:47.680
 for the small comma or assume the 

00:01:45.820 --> 00:01:50.229
 trait if I can say of the mucosa 

00:01:47.680 --> 00:01:52.030
 inside and here we go small to 

00:01:50.229 --> 00:01:53.860
 little you'll see that as and when 

00:01:52.030 --> 00:01:56.530
 measure I 'm going to thicken showing of 

00:01:53.860 --> 00:01:58.890
 veil has been so it's as much as you 

00:01:56.530 --> 00:01:58.890
 want 

00:02:10.720 --> 00:02:14.110
 I then applied makeup to 

00:02:12.370 --> 00:02:16.120
 black eyelids so that even Christian 

00:02:14.110 --> 00:02:19.210
 all day so like the principle 

00:02:16.120 --> 00:02:22.380
 powder and then I call messier 

00:02:19.210 --> 00:02:22.380
 I apply mascara 

00:02:27.050 --> 00:02:30.890
 I apply pencil on same as 

00:02:29.030 --> 00:02:31.910
 superior to intensify the look 

00:02:30.890 --> 00:02:34.010
 And now, it's over 

00:02:31.910 --> 00:02:35.900
 I hope that the tutorial will have helped you 

00:02:34.010 --> 00:02:37.520
 you will have liked I make full peak of 

00:02:35.900 --> 00:02:39.790
 revitalize and see you soon 

00:02:37.520 --> 00:02:39.790
 bye
