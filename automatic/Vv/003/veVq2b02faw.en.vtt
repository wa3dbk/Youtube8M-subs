00:00:27.130 --> 00:00:27.140 
strategy and that's what we are trying

00:00:27.140 --> 00:00:33.980 
strategy and that's what we are trying
to<00:00:27.260> do

you're the biggest economy in the world
so<00:00:36.510> we<00:00:36.540> need<00:00:37.050> resourcing<00:00:37.770> of<00:00:37.920> raw<00:00:38.280> materials

00:00:38.750 --> 00:00:38.760 
so we need resourcing of raw materials

00:00:38.760 --> 00:00:43.220 
so we need resourcing of raw materials
without<00:00:38.880> entrances<00:00:40.730> in<00:00:41.730> an<00:00:41.990> institution<00:00:42.990> you

raw materials initiative it's not about
the<00:01:27.050> people<00:01:27.260> in<00:01:27.500> Europe<00:01:27.860> it's<00:01:28.070> about<00:01:28.340> how<00:01:28.940> to

00:01:28.990 --> 00:01:29.000 
the people in Europe it's about how to

00:01:29.000 --> 00:01:31.330 
the people in Europe it's about how to
enrich<00:01:29.540> the<00:01:29.750> populations<00:01:30.350> even<00:01:30.680> flatter<00:01:30.950> and

00:01:33.340 --> 00:01:33.350 
how to ensure that European corporations

00:01:33.350 --> 00:01:36.310 
how to ensure that European corporations
have<00:01:33.830> competitive<00:01:34.580> edge<00:01:34.820> and<00:01:35.150> so<00:01:35.960> it's<00:01:36.140> all

00:01:36.310 --> 00:01:36.320 
have competitive edge and so it's all

00:01:36.320 --> 00:01:38.170 
have competitive edge and so it's all
about<00:01:36.350> corporate<00:01:37.100> interests<00:01:37.580> so<00:01:37.760> that's<00:01:38.000> what

about corporate interests so that's what

traditionally most countries including
Europe<00:01:54.909> have<00:01:55.540> used<00:01:55.899> expert<00:01:56.829> axes<00:01:57.159> to<00:01:57.430> promote

00:01:57.990 --> 00:01:58.000 
Europe have used expert axes to promote

Europe have used expert axes to promote
the<00:01:58.420> development<00:01:58.450> of<00:01:59.250> industries<00:02:00.250> to<00:02:00.460> move

00:02:00.600 --> 00:02:00.610 
the development of industries to move

00:02:00.610 --> 00:02:02.850 
the development of industries to move
them<00:02:00.790> to<00:02:00.939> a<00:02:01.030> level<00:02:01.360> but<00:02:01.869> most<00:02:02.079> importantly<00:02:02.560> it

00:02:02.850 --> 00:02:02.860 
them to a level but most importantly it

00:02:02.860 --> 00:02:04.649 
them to a level but most importantly it
helps<00:02:03.039> to<00:02:03.280> create<00:02:03.399> linkages<00:02:03.820> between<00:02:04.210> one

00:02:04.649 --> 00:02:04.659 
helps to create linkages between one

00:02:04.659 --> 00:02:07.560 
helps to create linkages between one
kind<00:02:05.200> of<00:02:05.350> sector<00:02:05.680> like<00:02:06.250> for<00:02:06.520> example<00:02:06.610> it<00:02:07.000> mind

00:02:07.560 --> 00:02:07.570 
kind of sector like for example it mind

00:02:07.570 --> 00:02:09.779 
kind of sector like for example it mind
industry<00:02:08.200> with<00:02:08.410> another<00:02:08.739> but<00:02:09.429> the<00:02:09.580> way<00:02:09.729> in

which<00:02:09.880> the<00:02:10.149> EU<00:02:10.420> is<00:02:10.630> pushing<00:02:11.019> these<00:02:11.170> rules<00:02:11.470> is

00:02:12.030 --> 00:02:12.040 
which the EU is pushing these rules is

00:02:12.040 --> 00:02:14.280 
which the EU is pushing these rules is
basically<00:02:12.670> to<00:02:12.819> take<00:02:12.970> away<00:02:13.269> that<00:02:13.510> policy<00:02:14.050> space

00:02:14.280 --> 00:02:14.290 
basically to take away that policy space

00:02:14.290 --> 00:02:16.710 
basically to take away that policy space
and<00:02:14.590> that<00:02:15.130> option<00:02:15.610> for<00:02:15.819> developing<00:02:16.239> countries

00:02:16.710 --> 00:02:16.720 
and that option for developing countries

00:02:16.720 --> 00:02:19.949 
and that option for developing countries
to<00:02:17.230> do<00:02:17.349> what<00:02:17.560> they<00:02:17.709> have<00:02:17.739> to<00:02:17.920> do<00:02:18.750> for<00:02:19.750> their<00:02:19.930> own
