hello<00:00:00.659> and<00:00:00.930> welcome<00:00:01.350> to<00:00:01.380> our<00:00:01.469> first<00:00:01.829> real<00:00:02.040> look

00:00:02.300 --> 00:00:02.310 
hello and welcome to our first real look

00:00:02.310 --> 00:00:04.760 
hello and welcome to our first real look
at<00:00:02.490> the<00:00:02.580> community<00:00:03.149> map<00:00:03.389> project<00:00:03.419> and<00:00:04.200> this<00:00:04.589> is

00:00:04.760 --> 00:00:04.770 
at the community map project and this is

00:00:04.770 --> 00:00:07.670 
at the community map project and this is
the<00:00:04.980> scale<00:00:05.400> test<00:00:05.850> release<00:00:06.270> so<00:00:07.020> what<00:00:07.230> we<00:00:07.350> get<00:00:07.529> is

00:00:07.670 --> 00:00:07.680 
the scale test release so what we get is

00:00:07.680 --> 00:00:09.950 
the scale test release so what we get is
a<00:00:07.770> very<00:00:07.980> basic<00:00:08.400> version<00:00:09.179> of<00:00:09.300> the<00:00:09.420> map<00:00:09.660> we've

00:00:09.950 --> 00:00:09.960 
a very basic version of the map we've

00:00:09.960 --> 00:00:11.629 
a very basic version of the map we've
got<00:00:10.110> the<00:00:10.200> layout<00:00:10.500> of<00:00:10.530> the<00:00:10.830> flags<00:00:11.130> we've<00:00:11.490> got<00:00:11.610> a

00:00:11.629 --> 00:00:11.639 
got the layout of the flags we've got a

00:00:11.639 --> 00:00:13.910 
got the layout of the flags we've got a
layout<00:00:11.880> of<00:00:12.000> the<00:00:12.240> terrain<00:00:12.660> but<00:00:13.530> there's<00:00:13.769> no

00:00:13.910 --> 00:00:13.920 
layout of the terrain but there's no

00:00:13.920 --> 00:00:17.300 
layout of the terrain but there's no
real<00:00:14.190> detail<00:00:14.790> on<00:00:15.000> the<00:00:15.150> map<00:00:15.560> so<00:00:16.560> it's<00:00:16.980> not

00:00:17.300 --> 00:00:17.310 
real detail on the map so it's not

00:00:17.310 --> 00:00:19.160 
real detail on the map so it's not
really<00:00:17.730> going<00:00:17.820> to<00:00:17.940> look<00:00:18.090> like<00:00:18.119> the<00:00:18.420> jungle<00:00:18.930> map

00:00:19.160 --> 00:00:19.170 
really going to look like the jungle map

00:00:19.170 --> 00:00:21.529 
really going to look like the jungle map
that<00:00:19.619> we're<00:00:19.980> expecting<00:00:20.789> because<00:00:21.000> there's<00:00:21.390> no

00:00:21.529 --> 00:00:21.539 
that we're expecting because there's no

00:00:21.539 --> 00:00:24.710 
that we're expecting because there's no
real<00:00:21.779> jungle<00:00:22.230> on<00:00:22.619> it<00:00:22.830> as<00:00:23.250> you<00:00:23.550> can<00:00:23.670> see<00:00:23.850> there's

00:00:24.710 --> 00:00:24.720 
real jungle on it as you can see there's

00:00:24.720 --> 00:00:27.439 
real jungle on it as you can see there's
no<00:00:24.900> grass<00:00:25.320> there's<00:00:25.859> no<00:00:26.039> ground<00:00:26.670> really<00:00:27.090> the

00:00:27.439 --> 00:00:27.449 
no grass there's no ground really the

00:00:27.449 --> 00:00:30.050 
no grass there's no ground really the
roads<00:00:27.689> are<00:00:27.869> perfectly<00:00:28.260> smooth<00:00:28.619> it's<00:00:29.460> just<00:00:29.910> a

00:00:30.050 --> 00:00:30.060 
roads are perfectly smooth it's just a

00:00:30.060 --> 00:00:32.630 
roads are perfectly smooth it's just a
placeholder<00:00:30.449> map<00:00:31.170> and<00:00:31.439> the<00:00:32.070> reason<00:00:32.399> for<00:00:32.430> this

00:00:32.630 --> 00:00:32.640 
placeholder map and the reason for this

00:00:32.640 --> 00:00:35.630 
placeholder map and the reason for this
is<00:00:32.850> it's<00:00:33.390> to<00:00:33.600> judge<00:00:33.840> how<00:00:34.440> far<00:00:34.469> away<00:00:34.950> the<00:00:35.219> flags

00:00:35.630 --> 00:00:35.640 
is it's to judge how far away the flags

00:00:35.640 --> 00:00:38.900 
is it's to judge how far away the flags
are<00:00:35.880> how<00:00:36.600> easy<00:00:36.989> it<00:00:37.320> is<00:00:37.410> to<00:00:37.469> get<00:00:37.890> to<00:00:38.370> certain

00:00:38.900 --> 00:00:38.910 
are how easy it is to get to certain

00:00:38.910 --> 00:00:41.270 
are how easy it is to get to certain
flags<00:00:39.210> for<00:00:39.450> each<00:00:39.570> team<00:00:39.960> whether<00:00:40.800> or<00:00:40.890> not<00:00:41.010> the

00:00:41.270 --> 00:00:41.280 
flags for each team whether or not the

00:00:41.280 --> 00:00:43.400 
flags for each team whether or not the
flag<00:00:41.520> locations<00:00:42.149> need<00:00:42.390> moving<00:00:42.840> backwards<00:00:43.290> or

00:00:43.400 --> 00:00:43.410 
flag locations need moving backwards or

00:00:43.410 --> 00:00:45.470 
flag locations need moving backwards or
forwards<00:00:43.950> and<00:00:44.489> it<00:00:44.640> also<00:00:44.760> lets<00:00:45.149> you<00:00:45.270> test

00:00:45.470 --> 00:00:45.480 
forwards and it also lets you test

00:00:45.480 --> 00:00:47.959 
forwards and it also lets you test
things<00:00:45.719> like<00:00:45.960> line<00:00:46.320> of<00:00:46.590> sight<00:00:46.860> is<00:00:47.129> one<00:00:47.700> Hill

00:00:47.959 --> 00:00:47.969 
things like line of sight is one Hill

00:00:47.969 --> 00:00:50.240 
things like line of sight is one Hill
giving<00:00:48.390> too<00:00:48.660> much<00:00:48.870> line<00:00:49.170> of<00:00:49.379> sight<00:00:49.590> to<00:00:49.620> all<00:00:49.980> the

00:00:50.240 --> 00:00:50.250 
giving too much line of sight to all the

00:00:50.250 --> 00:00:53.630 
giving too much line of sight to all the
flag<00:00:50.460> locations<00:00:51.210> or<00:00:51.420> is<00:00:52.230> it<00:00:52.770> too<00:00:53.100> hard<00:00:53.460> for

00:00:53.630 --> 00:00:53.640 
flag locations or is it too hard for

00:00:53.640 --> 00:00:56.450 
flag locations or is it too hard for
vehicles<00:00:54.300> to<00:00:54.539> get<00:00:54.690> to<00:00:55.079> one<00:00:55.410> flag<00:00:55.710> or<00:00:56.160> our

00:00:56.450 --> 00:00:56.460 
vehicles to get to one flag or our

00:00:56.460 --> 00:00:59.180 
vehicles to get to one flag or our
vehicles<00:00:57.180> dominating<00:00:57.989> one<00:00:58.170> flag<00:00:58.500> at<00:00:59.160> the

00:00:59.180 --> 00:00:59.190 
vehicles dominating one flag at the

00:00:59.190 --> 00:01:01.790 
vehicles dominating one flag at the
moment<00:00:59.640> there's<00:00:59.910> a<00:01:00.000> tank<00:01:00.329> first<00:01:00.660> side<00:01:00.930> there's

00:01:01.790 --> 00:01:01.800 
moment there's a tank first side there's

00:01:01.800 --> 00:01:04.700 
moment there's a tank first side there's
a<00:01:02.010> jeep<00:01:02.399> per<00:01:02.609> side<00:01:02.850> and<00:01:03.149> there's<00:01:04.049> a<00:01:04.260> couple<00:01:04.619> of

00:01:04.700 --> 00:01:04.710 
a jeep per side and there's a couple of

00:01:04.710 --> 00:01:08.359 
a jeep per side and there's a couple of
motorbikes<00:01:05.250> per<00:01:05.460> side<00:01:05.869> so<00:01:06.950> it's<00:01:07.950> not<00:01:08.070> really

00:01:08.359 --> 00:01:08.369 
motorbikes per side so it's not really

00:01:08.369 --> 00:01:10.460 
motorbikes per side so it's not really
designed<00:01:08.850> as<00:01:09.180> a<00:01:09.210> vehicle<00:01:09.479> heavy<00:01:09.900> map<00:01:10.200> from<00:01:10.409> the

00:01:10.460 --> 00:01:10.470 
designed as a vehicle heavy map from the

00:01:10.470 --> 00:01:12.350 
designed as a vehicle heavy map from the
looks<00:01:10.710> of<00:01:10.830> it<00:01:10.950> it's<00:01:11.250> more<00:01:11.520> designed<00:01:11.970> to<00:01:12.119> be<00:01:12.240> an

00:01:12.350 --> 00:01:12.360 
looks of it it's more designed to be an

00:01:12.360 --> 00:01:15.530 
looks of it it's more designed to be an
infantry<00:01:13.110> map<00:01:13.350> with<00:01:13.740> vehicles<00:01:14.460> that<00:01:14.790> help<00:01:15.299> the

00:01:15.530 --> 00:01:15.540 
infantry map with vehicles that help the

00:01:15.540 --> 00:01:17.990 
infantry map with vehicles that help the
infantry<00:01:16.020> get<00:01:16.200> around<00:01:16.580> now<00:01:17.580> as<00:01:17.700> you<00:01:17.850> can<00:01:17.939> see

00:01:17.990 --> 00:01:18.000 
infantry get around now as you can see

00:01:18.000 --> 00:01:21.800 
infantry get around now as you can see
it's<00:01:18.810> very<00:01:19.070> placeholder<00:01:20.070> this<00:01:20.759> flag<00:01:21.119> location

00:01:21.800 --> 00:01:21.810 
it's very placeholder this flag location

00:01:21.810 --> 00:01:23.899 
it's very placeholder this flag location
just<00:01:22.110> has<00:01:22.350> some<00:01:22.560> walls<00:01:22.830> around<00:01:23.159> it<00:01:23.369> it<00:01:23.610> will

00:01:23.899 --> 00:01:23.909 
just has some walls around it it will

00:01:23.909 --> 00:01:26.030 
just has some walls around it it will
have<00:01:24.119> buildings<00:01:24.659> and<00:01:24.840> things<00:01:24.869> here<00:01:25.320> but

00:01:26.030 --> 00:01:26.040 
have buildings and things here but

00:01:26.040 --> 00:01:28.160 
have buildings and things here but
they're<00:01:26.250> not<00:01:26.460> here<00:01:26.670> at<00:01:26.790> the<00:01:26.850> moment<00:01:27.170> the

00:01:28.160 --> 00:01:28.170 
they're not here at the moment the

00:01:28.170 --> 00:01:30.289 
they're not here at the moment the
waterfall<00:01:28.799> looks<00:01:28.979> really<00:01:29.490> odd<00:01:29.670> because

00:01:30.289 --> 00:01:30.299 
waterfall looks really odd because

00:01:30.299 --> 00:01:32.420 
waterfall looks really odd because
waterfalls<00:01:31.140> shouldn't<00:01:31.590> be<00:01:31.710> on<00:01:31.860> prom<00:01:32.250> and

00:01:32.420 --> 00:01:32.430 
waterfalls shouldn't be on prom and

00:01:32.430 --> 00:01:34.160 
waterfalls shouldn't be on prom and
trees<00:01:32.700> it<00:01:33.210> shouldn't<00:01:33.540> be<00:01:33.600> on<00:01:33.689> a<00:01:33.750> bit<00:01:33.960> that's

00:01:34.160 --> 00:01:34.170 
trees it shouldn't be on a bit that's

00:01:34.170 --> 00:01:35.929 
trees it shouldn't be on a bit that's
sticking<00:01:34.439> out<00:01:34.710> because<00:01:34.979> a<00:01:35.159> waterfall<00:01:35.729> will

00:01:35.929 --> 00:01:35.939 
sticking out because a waterfall will

00:01:35.939 --> 00:01:38.120 
sticking out because a waterfall will
cut<00:01:36.270> its<00:01:36.450> way<00:01:36.630> back<00:01:36.930> into<00:01:36.960> the<00:01:37.350> clip<00:01:37.650> so<00:01:38.009> it

00:01:38.120 --> 00:01:38.130 
cut its way back into the clip so it

00:01:38.130 --> 00:01:40.640 
cut its way back into the clip so it
should<00:01:38.430> be<00:01:38.460> in<00:01:38.790> a<00:01:38.939> bulb<00:01:39.439> something<00:01:40.439> else<00:01:40.560> that

00:01:40.640 --> 00:01:40.650 
should be in a bulb something else that

00:01:40.650 --> 00:01:42.140 
should be in a bulb something else that
slightly<00:01:40.979> worried<00:01:41.280> me<00:01:41.400> when<00:01:41.520> I<00:01:41.579> first<00:01:41.850> saw

00:01:42.140 --> 00:01:42.150 
slightly worried me when I first saw

00:01:42.150 --> 00:01:44.840 
slightly worried me when I first saw
this<00:01:42.390> map<00:01:42.659> is<00:01:42.869> the<00:01:43.439> large<00:01:43.740> hill<00:01:44.310> and<00:01:44.610> rock

00:01:44.840 --> 00:01:44.850 
this map is the large hill and rock

00:01:44.850 --> 00:01:47.719 
this map is the large hill and rock
formation<00:01:45.479> in<00:01:45.570> the<00:01:45.689> middle<00:01:45.990> now<00:01:46.829> it's<00:01:47.189> not<00:01:47.579> as

00:01:47.719 --> 00:01:47.729 
formation in the middle now it's not as

00:01:47.729 --> 00:01:49.429 
formation in the middle now it's not as
bad<00:01:47.939> as<00:01:48.000> it<00:01:48.270> looks<00:01:48.600> because<00:01:49.049> there's<00:01:49.259> no

00:01:49.429 --> 00:01:49.439 
bad as it looks because there's no

00:01:49.439 --> 00:01:51.260 
bad as it looks because there's no
helicopters<00:01:50.220> on<00:01:50.369> this<00:01:50.549> map<00:01:50.790> and<00:01:51.060> there's

00:01:51.260 --> 00:01:51.270 
helicopters on this map and there's

00:01:51.270 --> 00:01:53.780 
helicopters on this map and there's
actually<00:01:51.390> no<00:01:51.930> way<00:01:52.200> to<00:01:52.259> get<00:01:52.590> up<00:01:52.799> onto<00:01:53.070> that<00:01:53.369> hill

00:01:53.780 --> 00:01:53.790 
actually no way to get up onto that hill

00:01:53.790 --> 00:01:56.389 
actually no way to get up onto that hill
it<00:01:54.540> literally<00:01:55.020> just<00:01:55.380> sits<00:01:55.680> there<00:01:55.770> and<00:01:55.950> blocks

00:01:56.389 --> 00:01:56.399 
it literally just sits there and blocks

00:01:56.399 --> 00:01:59.030 
it literally just sits there and blocks
line<00:01:56.670> of<00:01:56.880> sight<00:01:57.149> the<00:01:57.810> signs<00:01:58.140> are<00:01:58.350> pretty<00:01:58.590> steep

00:01:59.030 --> 00:01:59.040 
line of sight the signs are pretty steep

00:01:59.040 --> 00:02:02.149 
line of sight the signs are pretty steep
he<00:01:59.729> can<00:01:59.969> get<00:02:00.180> halfway<00:02:00.659> up<00:02:01.079> the<00:02:01.110> sides<00:02:01.530> but

00:02:02.149 --> 00:02:02.159 
he can get halfway up the sides but

00:02:02.159 --> 00:02:04.639 
he can get halfway up the sides but
there's<00:02:02.460> no<00:02:02.640> cover<00:02:02.969> on<00:02:03.210> them<00:02:03.420> but<00:02:04.110> this<00:02:04.320> top

00:02:04.639 --> 00:02:04.649 
there's no cover on them but this top

00:02:04.649 --> 00:02:06.590 
there's no cover on them but this top
section<00:02:04.890> it<00:02:05.460> doesn't<00:02:05.969> appear<00:02:06.240> that<00:02:06.299> you<00:02:06.479> can

00:02:06.590 --> 00:02:06.600 
section it doesn't appear that you can

00:02:06.600 --> 00:02:08.660 
section it doesn't appear that you can
actually<00:02:06.719> get<00:02:07.020> onto<00:02:07.469> it<00:02:07.590> so<00:02:07.770> it's<00:02:08.039> not<00:02:08.429> going

00:02:08.660 --> 00:02:08.670 
actually get onto it so it's not going

00:02:08.670 --> 00:02:10.880 
actually get onto it so it's not going
to<00:02:08.789> be<00:02:08.910> a<00:02:09.119> dominating<00:02:09.869> sniper<00:02:10.170> perch

one<00:02:11.850> problem<00:02:12.120> may<00:02:12.420> be<00:02:12.450> that<00:02:12.690> the<00:02:13.020> hill

00:02:13.280 --> 00:02:13.290 
one problem may be that the hill

00:02:13.290 --> 00:02:15.350 
one problem may be that the hill
actually<00:02:13.710> blocks<00:02:14.100> the<00:02:14.520> central<00:02:15.090> point

00:02:15.350 --> 00:02:15.360

00:02:28.940 --> 00:02:28.950 
didn't seem to be a problem although

00:02:28.950 --> 00:02:31.970 
didn't seem to be a problem although
it's<00:02:29.280> a<00:02:29.459> bit<00:02:29.490> hard<00:02:30.209> to<00:02:30.360> judge<00:02:30.840> vehicle<00:02:31.620> speeds

00:02:31.970 --> 00:02:31.980 
it's a bit hard to judge vehicle speeds

00:02:31.980 --> 00:02:34.040 
it's a bit hard to judge vehicle speeds
and<00:02:32.250> how<00:02:32.430> good<00:02:32.940> the<00:02:33.120> vehicle<00:02:33.480> access<00:02:33.720> is<00:02:33.900> going

00:02:38.870 --> 00:02:38.880 
is completely smooth it's not like

00:02:38.880 --> 00:02:41.330 
is completely smooth it's not like

flag from the side I've just come from

00:02:59.250 --> 00:03:01.880 
flag from the side I've just come from
if<00:02:59.730> you<00:03:00.510> come<00:03:00.780> from<00:03:00.930> the<00:03:01.050> side<00:03:01.260> with<00:03:01.470> a<00:03:01.500> hill

00:03:01.890 --> 00:03:03.770 
if you come from the side with a hill
you've<00:03:02.250> obviously<00:03:02.400> got<00:03:02.760> to<00:03:02.910> go<00:03:03.060> around<00:03:03.600> the

you've obviously got to go around the

you've obviously got to go around the
hill<00:03:04.019> and<00:03:04.230> that<00:03:05.160> kind<00:03:05.459> of<00:03:05.640> funnels<00:03:06.209> the

hill and that kind of funnels the

00:03:06.300 --> 00:03:10.310 
hill and that kind of funnels the
vehicles<00:03:06.959> into<00:03:07.470> two<00:03:07.709> routes<00:03:08.780> you<00:03:09.780> could<00:03:10.019> solve

vehicles into two routes you could solve

00:03:10.320 --> 00:03:12.140 
vehicles into two routes you could solve
that<00:03:10.500> problem<00:03:10.800> by<00:03:11.220> putting<00:03:11.459> a<00:03:11.640> transport

00:03:12.140 --> 00:03:12.150 
that problem by putting a transport

00:03:12.150 --> 00:03:14.390 
that problem by putting a transport
helicopter<00:03:12.720> on<00:03:12.840> there<00:03:13.080> but<00:03:13.709> then<00:03:14.040> you've<00:03:14.250> got

00:03:14.390 --> 00:03:14.400 
helicopter on there but then you've got

00:03:14.400 --> 00:03:16.250 
helicopter on there but then you've got
the<00:03:14.519> problem<00:03:14.940> that<00:03:15.090> the<00:03:15.180> central<00:03:15.540> Hill<00:03:15.900> does

00:03:16.250 --> 00:03:16.260 
the problem that the central Hill does

00:03:16.260 --> 00:03:19.130 
the problem that the central Hill does
become<00:03:16.709> an<00:03:16.890> accessible<00:03:17.489> sniper<00:03:17.820> perch<00:03:18.209> so

00:03:19.130 --> 00:03:19.140 
become an accessible sniper perch so

00:03:19.140 --> 00:03:21.410 
become an accessible sniper perch so
it's<00:03:19.530> a<00:03:19.680> bit<00:03:19.829> swings<00:03:20.280> and<00:03:20.579> roundabouts<00:03:21.120> if

00:03:21.410 --> 00:03:21.420 
it's a bit swings and roundabouts if

00:03:21.420 --> 00:03:23.780 
it's a bit swings and roundabouts if
they<00:03:21.930> put<00:03:22.290> helicopters<00:03:22.950> on<00:03:23.100> they<00:03:23.430> would<00:03:23.579> have

00:03:23.780 --> 00:03:23.790 
they put helicopters on they would have

00:03:23.790 --> 00:03:26.420 
they put helicopters on they would have
to<00:03:24.260> dramatically<00:03:25.260> lower<00:03:25.620> the<00:03:25.860> height<00:03:26.070> of<00:03:26.130> that

to dramatically lower the height of that
central<00:03:27.000> hill<00:03:27.299> and<00:03:27.570> make<00:03:27.810> it<00:03:27.959> accessible<00:03:28.170> on

00:03:28.970 --> 00:03:28.980 
central hill and make it accessible on

can<00:03:41.040> even<00:03:41.160> drive<00:03:41.459> vehicles<00:03:42.000> up<00:03:42.209> there<00:03:42.480> so<00:03:43.110> the

00:03:43.400 --> 00:03:43.410 
can even drive vehicles up there so the

00:03:43.410 --> 00:03:44.990 
can even drive vehicles up there so the
snipers<00:03:43.890> aren't<00:03:44.070> exactly<00:03:44.400> safe<00:03:44.730> on<00:03:44.970> that

00:03:44.990 --> 00:03:45.000 
snipers aren't exactly safe on that

00:03:45.000 --> 00:03:48.110 
snipers aren't exactly safe on that
central<00:03:45.780> hill<00:03:46.049> if<00:03:46.320> you<00:03:46.920> did<00:03:47.070> that<00:03:47.100> on<00:03:47.459> this<00:03:47.880> map

00:03:48.110 --> 00:03:48.120 
central hill if you did that on this map

00:03:48.120 --> 00:03:50.960 
central hill if you did that on this map
I<00:03:48.360> think<00:03:49.110> it<00:03:49.290> would<00:03:49.500> work<00:03:49.530> out<00:03:49.950> better<00:03:50.610> than

00:03:50.960 --> 00:03:50.970 
I think it would work out better than

00:03:50.970 --> 00:03:53.030 
I think it would work out better than
maybe<00:03:51.390> having<00:03:51.989> this<00:03:52.170> large<00:03:52.590> tall

00:03:53.030 --> 00:03:53.040 
maybe having this large tall

00:03:53.040 --> 00:03:56.090 
maybe having this large tall
inaccessible<00:03:53.970> hill<00:03:54.440> but<00:03:55.440> I<00:03:55.560> do<00:03:55.620> think<00:03:55.980> that

00:03:56.090 --> 00:03:56.100 
inaccessible hill but I do think that

00:03:56.100 --> 00:03:58.190 
inaccessible hill but I do think that
this<00:03:56.310> was<00:03:56.549> the<00:03:56.730> best<00:03:57.000> map<00:03:57.299> layout<00:03:57.660> out<00:03:57.870> of<00:03:58.049> the

00:03:58.190 --> 00:03:58.200 
this was the best map layout out of the

00:03:58.200 --> 00:04:01.069 
this was the best map layout out of the
three<00:03:58.500> it's<00:03:58.890> got<00:03:59.130> the<00:03:59.310> classic<00:03:59.640> 5<00:04:00.180> flag<00:04:00.570> layout

00:04:01.069 --> 00:04:01.079 
three it's got the classic 5 flag layout

00:04:01.079 --> 00:04:04.400 
three it's got the classic 5 flag layout
it's<00:04:01.739> also<00:04:01.980> got<00:04:02.400> the<00:04:02.579> classic<00:04:02.870> you've<00:04:03.870> got<00:04:04.140> two

00:04:04.400 --> 00:04:04.410 
it's also got the classic you've got two

00:04:04.410 --> 00:04:07.190 
it's also got the classic you've got two
flags<00:04:04.769> the<00:04:05.190> opposition's<00:04:05.850> got<00:04:06.060> two<00:04:06.299> flags<00:04:06.660> but

00:04:07.190 --> 00:04:07.200 
flags the opposition's got two flags but

00:04:07.200 --> 00:04:08.750 
flags the opposition's got two flags but
there's<00:04:07.410> one<00:04:07.650> in<00:04:07.709> the<00:04:07.980> middle<00:04:08.220> that's<00:04:08.549> the

00:04:08.750 --> 00:04:08.760 
there's one in the middle that's the

00:04:08.760 --> 00:04:11.870 
there's one in the middle that's the
real<00:04:08.970> fight<00:04:09.329> and<00:04:09.630> choke<00:04:09.900> point<00:04:10.549> the<00:04:11.549> actually

00:04:11.870 --> 00:04:11.880 
real fight and choke point the actually

00:04:11.880 --> 00:04:13.250 
real fight and choke point the actually
singing<00:04:12.060> in<00:04:12.180> the<00:04:12.209> background<00:04:12.269> is<00:04:12.870> from<00:04:12.989> one<00:04:13.230> of

00:04:13.250 --> 00:04:13.260 
singing in the background is from one of

00:04:13.260 --> 00:04:16.090 
singing in the background is from one of
the<00:04:13.410> rounds<00:04:13.769> I<00:04:13.890> played<00:04:14.250> I've<00:04:14.790> got<00:04:15.299> the<00:04:15.570> scar-h

00:04:16.090 --> 00:04:16.100 
the rounds I played I've got the scar-h

00:04:16.100 --> 00:04:19.009 
the rounds I played I've got the scar-h
SB<00:04:17.100> and<00:04:17.459> it's<00:04:17.820> in<00:04:17.970> the<00:04:18.060> load<00:04:18.269> out<00:04:18.419> I<00:04:18.630> was<00:04:18.780> using

00:04:19.009 --> 00:04:19.019 
SB and it's in the load out I was using

00:04:19.019 --> 00:04:21.409 
SB and it's in the load out I was using
to<00:04:19.229> test<00:04:19.830> the<00:04:20.039> night<00:04:20.280> maps<00:04:20.549> which<00:04:20.849> is<00:04:21.030> why<00:04:21.209> it's

00:04:21.409 --> 00:04:21.419 
to test the night maps which is why it's

00:04:21.419 --> 00:04:24.000 
to test the night maps which is why it's
got<00:04:21.539> the<00:04:21.750> IR<00:04:22.320> Envy<00:04:22.650> scope<00:04:22.979> on<00:04:23.220> it

00:04:24.000 --> 00:04:24.010 
got the IR Envy scope on it

00:04:24.010 --> 00:04:25.800 
got the IR Envy scope on it
because<00:04:24.190> I<00:04:24.280> lot<00:04:24.490> of<00:04:24.550> problems<00:04:24.910> with<00:04:24.970> crashing

00:04:25.800 --> 00:04:25.810 
because I lot of problems with crashing

00:04:25.810 --> 00:04:28.260 
because I lot of problems with crashing
using<00:04:26.260> the<00:04:26.410> iron<00:04:27.040> be<00:04:27.220> scoped<00:04:27.550> now<00:04:28.060> they've

00:04:28.260 --> 00:04:28.270 
using the iron be scoped now they've

00:04:28.270 --> 00:04:30.240 
using the iron be scoped now they've
done<00:04:28.300> the<00:04:28.600> update<00:04:28.960> I've<00:04:29.410> gone<00:04:29.860> back<00:04:30.070> and

00:04:30.240 --> 00:04:30.250 
done the update I've gone back and

00:04:30.250 --> 00:04:32.090 
done the update I've gone back and
started<00:04:30.550> testing<00:04:30.970> it<00:04:31.090> again<00:04:31.390> to<00:04:31.600> see<00:04:31.750> if<00:04:31.780> it

00:04:32.090 --> 00:04:32.100 
started testing it again to see if it

00:04:32.100 --> 00:04:35.010 
started testing it again to see if it
still<00:04:33.100> causes<00:04:33.400> me<00:04:33.730> to<00:04:33.850> crash<00:04:34.180> and<00:04:34.480> the<00:04:34.840> good

00:04:35.010 --> 00:04:35.020 
still causes me to crash and the good

00:04:35.020 --> 00:04:37.590 
still causes me to crash and the good
news<00:04:35.050> is<00:04:35.380> it<00:04:35.590> doesn't<00:04:35.970> it's<00:04:36.970> really<00:04:37.210> hard<00:04:37.330> to

00:04:37.590 --> 00:04:37.600 
news is it doesn't it's really hard to

00:04:37.600 --> 00:04:39.450 
news is it doesn't it's really hard to
judge<00:04:37.840> what<00:04:38.230> the<00:04:38.350> actual<00:04:38.440> gameplay<00:04:38.920> on<00:04:39.280> this

00:04:39.450 --> 00:04:39.460 
judge what the actual gameplay on this

00:04:39.460 --> 00:04:41.880 
judge what the actual gameplay on this
map<00:04:39.670> is<00:04:39.700> going<00:04:40.090> to<00:04:40.210> be<00:04:40.330> like<00:04:40.650> because<00:04:41.650> of<00:04:41.800> the

00:04:41.880 --> 00:04:41.890 
map is going to be like because of the

00:04:41.890 --> 00:04:43.830 
map is going to be like because of the
lack<00:04:42.100> of<00:04:42.130> cover<00:04:42.730> it's<00:04:43.000> currently<00:04:43.750> being

00:04:43.830 --> 00:04:43.840 
lack of cover it's currently being

00:04:43.840 --> 00:04:46.350 
lack of cover it's currently being
played<00:04:44.260> by<00:04:44.530> a<00:04:44.560> lot<00:04:44.920> of<00:04:45.100> snipers<00:04:45.670> and<00:04:45.910> a<00:04:46.090> lot<00:04:46.330> of

00:04:46.350 --> 00:04:46.360 
played by a lot of snipers and a lot of

00:04:46.360 --> 00:04:49.260 
played by a lot of snipers and a lot of
people<00:04:46.510> with<00:04:46.960> dmrs<00:04:47.560> or<00:04:47.830> long-range<00:04:48.430> options

00:04:49.260 --> 00:04:49.270 
people with dmrs or long-range options

00:04:49.270 --> 00:04:51.660 
people with dmrs or long-range options
you<00:04:50.110> don't<00:04:50.440> get<00:04:50.590> an<00:04:50.680> awful<00:04:50.980> lot<00:04:51.070> of<00:04:51.130> close-up

00:04:51.660 --> 00:04:51.670 
you don't get an awful lot of close-up

00:04:51.670 --> 00:04:54.330 
you don't get an awful lot of close-up
combat<00:04:52.150> because<00:04:52.720> there<00:04:53.590> just<00:04:53.620> isn't<00:04:53.830> the

00:04:54.330 --> 00:04:54.340 
combat because there just isn't the

00:04:54.340 --> 00:04:57.510 
combat because there just isn't the
cover<00:04:54.580> for<00:04:54.880> it<00:04:55.290> anytime<00:04:56.290> you<00:04:56.590> move<00:04:56.770> on<00:04:57.040> foot

00:04:57.510 --> 00:04:57.520 
cover for it anytime you move on foot

00:04:57.520 --> 00:04:59.670 
cover for it anytime you move on foot
from<00:04:57.790> one<00:04:58.120> flag<00:04:58.420> to<00:04:58.600> another<00:04:58.930> you<00:04:59.320> are<00:04:59.470> moving

00:04:59.670 --> 00:04:59.680 
from one flag to another you are moving

00:04:59.680 --> 00:05:02.820 
from one flag to another you are moving
through<00:04:59.920> very<00:05:00.490> open<00:05:00.940> areas<00:05:01.360> if<00:05:02.350> I<00:05:02.530> was<00:05:02.680> going

00:05:02.820 --> 00:05:02.830 
through very open areas if I was going

00:05:02.830 --> 00:05:04.680 
through very open areas if I was going
to<00:05:02.890> make<00:05:03.010> prediction<00:05:03.520> as<00:05:03.790> to<00:05:03.820> how<00:05:04.240> this<00:05:04.450> much

00:05:04.680 --> 00:05:04.690 
to make prediction as to how this much

00:05:04.690 --> 00:05:06.810 
to make prediction as to how this much
going<00:05:04.930> to<00:05:04.990> play<00:05:05.230> out<00:05:05.440> I<00:05:05.650> think<00:05:06.340> it's<00:05:06.550> going<00:05:06.700> to

00:05:06.810 --> 00:05:06.820 
going to play out I think it's going to

00:05:06.820 --> 00:05:08.330 
going to play out I think it's going to
be<00:05:06.970> something<00:05:07.510> like<00:05:07.900> a<00:05:07.960> cross<00:05:08.290> between

00:05:08.330 --> 00:05:08.340 
be something like a cross between

00:05:08.340 --> 00:05:12.420 
be something like a cross between
dragons<00:05:09.340> pass<00:05:09.730> and<00:05:10.060> growling<00:05:10.900> peaks<00:05:11.430> it's

00:05:12.420 --> 00:05:12.430 
dragons pass and growling peaks it's

00:05:12.430 --> 00:05:15.030 
dragons pass and growling peaks it's
gonna<00:05:12.880> be<00:05:13.120> probably<00:05:14.020> slap<00:05:14.560> bang<00:05:14.830> in<00:05:14.860> the

00:05:15.030 --> 00:05:15.040 
gonna be probably slap bang in the

00:05:15.040 --> 00:05:17.790 
gonna be probably slap bang in the
middle<00:05:15.160> between<00:05:15.520> those<00:05:16.000> two<00:05:16.270> it's<00:05:17.230> not<00:05:17.590> going

00:05:17.790 --> 00:05:17.800 
middle between those two it's not going

00:05:17.800 --> 00:05:20.580 
middle between those two it's not going
to<00:05:17.860> have<00:05:18.070> the<00:05:18.390> ultra-long<00:05:19.390> range<00:05:19.450> and<00:05:20.080> vehicle

00:05:20.580 --> 00:05:20.590 
to have the ultra-long range and vehicle

00:05:20.590 --> 00:05:24.300 
to have the ultra-long range and vehicle
heaviness<00:05:21.040> of<00:05:21.690> dragons<00:05:22.690> pass<00:05:22.990> but<00:05:23.950> it<00:05:23.980> but

00:05:24.300 --> 00:05:24.310 
heaviness of dragons pass but it but

00:05:24.310 --> 00:05:25.710 
heaviness of dragons pass but it but
it's<00:05:24.430> also<00:05:24.580> not<00:05:24.910> going<00:05:25.090> to<00:05:25.150> have<00:05:25.330> the<00:05:25.540> more

00:05:25.710 --> 00:05:25.720 
it's also not going to have the more

00:05:25.720 --> 00:05:28.440 
it's also not going to have the more
infantry<00:05:26.500> centered<00:05:27.010> focus<00:05:27.580> that<00:05:27.790> you<00:05:28.000> get<00:05:28.210> in

00:05:28.440 --> 00:05:28.450 
infantry centered focus that you get in

00:05:28.450 --> 00:05:31.050 
infantry centered focus that you get in
guilin<00:05:28.930> peaks<00:05:29.260> it's<00:05:29.740> going<00:05:30.190> to<00:05:30.340> be<00:05:30.490> somewhere

00:05:31.050 --> 00:05:31.060 
guilin peaks it's going to be somewhere

there's<00:06:21.100> not<00:06:21.220> really<00:06:21.550> much<00:06:21.820> point<00:06:21.880> going<00:06:22.420> into

00:06:24.780 --> 00:06:24.790 
this version of the map in an awful lot

00:06:24.790 --> 00:06:27.900 
this version of the map in an awful lot
detail<00:06:25.390> because<00:06:26.050> it<00:06:26.200> is<00:06:26.350> a<00:06:26.830> very<00:06:27.490> early

detail because it is a very early

version of the map and it's not probably

00:06:30.190 --> 00:06:31.980 
version of the map and it's not probably
going<00:06:30.490> to<00:06:30.550> be<00:06:30.700> what<00:06:31.150> we<00:06:31.360> end<00:06:31.510> up<00:06:31.660> playing

00:06:31.980 --> 00:06:31.990 
going to be what we end up playing

going to be what we end up playing
there's<00:06:32.350> going<00:06:32.500> to<00:06:32.560> be<00:06:32.590> a<00:06:32.650> lot<00:06:32.890> of<00:06:32.950> tweaks<00:06:33.400> a

00:06:33.630 --> 00:06:33.640 
there's going to be a lot of tweaks a

00:06:33.640 --> 00:06:36.030 
there's going to be a lot of tweaks a
lot<00:06:33.790> of<00:06:33.880> changes<00:06:34.510> and<00:06:34.720> of<00:06:35.410> course<00:06:35.440> we're<00:06:35.890> going

00:06:36.030 --> 00:06:36.040 
lot of changes and of course we're going

00:06:36.040 --> 00:06:37.910 
lot of changes and of course we're going
to<00:06:36.100> have<00:06:36.330> textures<00:06:37.330> and

00:06:37.910 --> 00:06:37.920 
to have textures and
