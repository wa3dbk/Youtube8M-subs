it play place stop what it does is let's

00:01:50.759 --> 00:01:52.340 
it play place stop what it does is let's
say<00:01:50.880> you<00:01:51.000> said<00:01:51.299> it<00:01:51.420> said<00:01:51.600> if<00:01:51.720> you<00:01:51.840> press<00:01:52.079> space

00:01:52.340 --> 00:01:52.350 
say you said it said if you press space

00:01:52.350 --> 00:01:53.749 
say you said it said if you press space
it's<00:01:52.560> going<00:01:52.680> to<00:01:52.740> play<00:01:52.920> it's<00:01:53.340> going<00:01:53.549> to<00:01:53.610> keep

00:01:53.749 --> 00:01:53.759 
it's going to play it's going to keep

00:01:53.759 --> 00:01:55.670 
it's going to play it's going to keep
playing<00:01:53.909> and<00:01:54.210> let<00:01:54.390> until<00:01:54.780> you<00:01:54.930> release<00:01:55.140> space

00:01:55.670 --> 00:01:55.680 
playing and let until you release space

00:01:55.680 --> 00:01:59.240 
playing and let until you release space
that's<00:01:56.219> what<00:01:56.399> place<00:01:56.610> stopped<00:01:56.909> us<00:01:57.439> if<00:01:58.439> we're

00:01:59.240 --> 00:01:59.250 
that's what place stopped us if we're

00:01:59.250 --> 00:02:01.850 
that's what place stopped us if we're
using<00:01:59.369> space<00:01:59.820> obviously<00:02:00.119> play<00:02:01.049> end<00:02:01.350> would

00:02:01.850 --> 00:02:01.860 
using space obviously play end would

00:02:01.860 --> 00:02:04.039 
using space obviously play end would
keep<00:02:02.100> going<00:02:02.460> until<00:02:02.670> the<00:02:03.240> song<00:02:03.450> actually<00:02:03.689> ends

00:02:04.039 --> 00:02:04.049 
keep going until the song actually ends

00:02:04.049 --> 00:02:07.429 
keep going until the song actually ends
so<00:02:04.170> let's<00:02:04.409> say<00:02:04.560> you<00:02:05.600> press<00:02:06.600> space<00:02:06.990> it<00:02:07.259> would

00:02:07.429 --> 00:02:07.439 
so let's say you press space it would

00:02:07.439 --> 00:02:08.869 
so let's say you press space it would
keep<00:02:07.590> going<00:02:07.920> even<00:02:08.039> if<00:02:08.190> you<00:02:08.310> release<00:02:08.580> space

00:02:08.869 --> 00:02:08.879 
keep going even if you release space

00:02:08.879 --> 00:02:10.460 
keep going even if you release space
until<00:02:09.270> the<00:02:09.450> song<00:02:09.660> ends

00:02:10.460 --> 00:02:10.470 
until the song ends

00:02:10.470 --> 00:02:13.520 
until the song ends
loop<00:02:11.190> stop<00:02:11.670> it<00:02:12.390> just<00:02:12.600> keeps<00:02:12.870> looping<00:02:13.170> until

00:02:13.520 --> 00:02:13.530 
loop stop it just keeps looping until

00:02:13.530 --> 00:02:16.130 
loop stop it just keeps looping until
you<00:02:13.830> release<00:02:14.010> the<00:02:14.340> button<00:02:14.580> or<00:02:15.020> deactivate<00:02:16.020> the

00:02:16.130 --> 00:02:16.140 
you release the button or deactivate the

00:02:16.140 --> 00:02:18.650 
you release the button or deactivate the
song<00:02:16.350> and<00:02:16.730> loop<00:02:17.730> end<00:02:18.030> would<00:02:18.180> keep<00:02:18.390> looping

00:02:18.650 --> 00:02:18.660 
song and loop end would keep looping

00:02:18.660 --> 00:02:20.330 
song and loop end would keep looping
until<00:02:18.990> you<00:02:19.320> stop<00:02:19.650> and<00:02:19.860> then<00:02:19.950> it's<00:02:20.100> just<00:02:20.190> going

00:02:20.330 --> 00:02:20.340 
until you stop and then it's just going

00:02:20.340 --> 00:02:22.490 
until you stop and then it's just going
to<00:02:20.430> finish<00:02:20.520> the<00:02:21.050> it's<00:02:22.050> going<00:02:22.200> to<00:02:22.260> go<00:02:22.320> through

00:02:22.490 --> 00:02:22.500 
to finish the it's going to go through

00:02:22.500 --> 00:02:25.520 
to finish the it's going to go through
the<00:02:22.740> file<00:02:23.130> and<00:02:23.460> then<00:02:23.610> stop<00:02:24.170> anyway<00:02:25.170> so<00:02:25.230> what

00:02:25.520 --> 00:02:25.530 
the file and then stop anyway so what

00:02:25.530 --> 00:02:28.670 
the file and then stop anyway so what
we're<00:02:25.680> going<00:02:25.860> to<00:02:25.950> need<00:02:26.070> here<00:02:26.370> is<00:02:27.110> Luke<00:02:28.110> stop<00:02:28.470> or

00:02:28.670 --> 00:02:28.680 
we're going to need here is Luke stop or

00:02:28.680 --> 00:02:30.950 
we're going to need here is Luke stop or
loop<00:02:28.830> and<00:02:29.070> it<00:02:29.160> doesn't<00:02:29.400> really<00:02:29.490> matter<00:02:29.810> so<00:02:30.810> now

00:02:30.950 --> 00:02:30.960 
loop and it doesn't really matter so now

00:02:30.960 --> 00:02:33.650 
loop and it doesn't really matter so now
the<00:02:31.020> way<00:02:31.500> we<00:02:31.680> set<00:02:31.890> it<00:02:31.920> up<00:02:32.130> is<00:02:32.370> it's<00:02:33.360> going<00:02:33.600> to

00:02:33.650 --> 00:02:33.660 
the way we set it up is it's going to

00:02:33.660 --> 00:02:36.290 
the way we set it up is it's going to
always<00:02:33.840> keep<00:02:34.440> looping<00:02:34.770> this<00:02:35.370> file<00:02:35.700> so<00:02:36.150> this

00:02:36.290 --> 00:02:36.300 
always keep looping this file so this

00:02:36.300 --> 00:02:38.630 
always keep looping this file so this
file<00:02:36.480> is<00:02:36.600> going<00:02:36.720> to<00:02:36.780> keep<00:02:36.900> playing<00:02:37.400> so<00:02:38.400> if<00:02:38.520> you

00:02:38.630 --> 00:02:38.640 
file is going to keep playing so if you

00:02:38.640 --> 00:02:42.800 
file is going to keep playing so if you
press<00:02:38.850> P<00:02:39.150> it<00:02:39.360> should<00:02:39.570> play<00:02:41.420> so<00:02:42.420> here<00:02:42.630> it<00:02:42.720> is

00:02:42.800 --> 00:02:42.810 
press P it should play so here it is

00:02:42.810 --> 00:02:45.680 
press P it should play so here it is
it's<00:02:43.080> plays<00:02:43.640> works<00:02:44.640> fine<00:02:44.850> for<00:02:44.910> me<00:02:45.150> should<00:02:45.480> work

00:02:45.680 --> 00:02:45.690 
it's plays works fine for me should work

00:02:45.690 --> 00:02:47.330 
it's plays works fine for me should work
for<00:02:45.930> you<00:02:45.990> as<00:02:46.110> well<00:02:46.290> so<00:02:46.950> now<00:02:47.040> we're<00:02:47.190> going<00:02:47.280> to

00:02:47.330 --> 00:02:47.340 
for you as well so now we're going to

00:02:47.340 --> 00:02:50.720 
for you as well so now we're going to
add<00:02:48.080> to<00:02:49.080> the<00:02:49.200> cube<00:02:49.560> let's<00:02:50.100> say<00:02:50.280> the<00:02:50.430> cube<00:02:50.640> is

00:02:50.720 --> 00:02:50.730 
add to the cube let's say the cube is

00:02:50.730 --> 00:02:52.640 
add to the cube let's say the cube is
the<00:02:50.880> character<00:02:51.300> and<00:02:51.570> the<00:02:52.050> sound<00:02:52.290> that<00:02:52.470> we're

00:02:52.640 --> 00:02:52.650 
the character and the sound that we're

00:02:52.650 --> 00:02:54.560 
the character and the sound that we're
going<00:02:52.770> to<00:02:52.830> add<00:02:52.920> is<00:02:53.100> the<00:02:53.250> jump<00:02:53.550> sound<00:02:53.820> or<00:02:54.180> let's

00:02:54.560 --> 00:02:54.570 
going to add is the jump sound or let's

00:02:54.570 --> 00:02:57.080 
going to add is the jump sound or let's
say<00:02:54.750> he<00:02:54.870> casts<00:02:55.290> a<00:02:55.380> spell<00:02:55.410> or<00:02:55.620> whatever<00:02:56.090> we

00:02:57.080 --> 00:02:57.090 
say he casts a spell or whatever we

00:02:57.090 --> 00:02:58.970 
say he casts a spell or whatever we
don't<00:02:57.180> have<00:02:57.390> any<00:02:57.690> graphics<00:02:58.290> obviously<00:02:58.770> so

00:02:58.970 --> 00:02:58.980 
don't have any graphics obviously so

00:02:58.980 --> 00:03:00.199 
don't have any graphics obviously so
doesn't<00:02:59.520> really<00:02:59.640> matter<00:02:59.820> so<00:03:00.060> we're<00:03:00.180> just

00:03:00.199 --> 00:03:00.209 
doesn't really matter so we're just

00:03:00.209 --> 00:03:02.750 
doesn't really matter so we're just
going<00:03:00.390> to<00:03:00.450> go<00:03:00.720> keyboard<00:03:01.140> sense<00:03:01.980> at<00:03:02.190> a<00:03:02.250> keyboard

00:03:02.750 --> 00:03:02.760 
going to go keyboard sense at a keyboard

00:03:02.760 --> 00:03:05.630 
going to go keyboard sense at a keyboard
sensor<00:03:03.270> key<00:03:03.959> space<00:03:04.590> you<00:03:05.010> should<00:03:05.220> just<00:03:05.250> press

00:03:05.630 --> 00:03:05.640 
sensor key space you should just press

00:03:05.640 --> 00:03:08.140 
sensor key space you should just press
over<00:03:06.030> here<00:03:06.240> says<00:03:07.080> press<00:03:07.290> a<00:03:07.320> key<00:03:07.560> press<00:03:07.860> space

00:03:08.140 --> 00:03:08.150 
over here says press a key press space

00:03:08.150 --> 00:03:10.460 
over here says press a key press space
so<00:03:09.150> now<00:03:09.270> when<00:03:09.420> you<00:03:09.480> press<00:03:09.720> space<00:03:09.990> it's<00:03:10.290> going

00:03:10.460 --> 00:03:10.470 
so now when you press space it's going

00:03:10.470 --> 00:03:11.570 
so now when you press space it's going
to<00:03:10.530> do<00:03:10.590> whatever<00:03:10.770> you<00:03:10.950> want<00:03:11.100> it<00:03:11.220> to<00:03:11.250> do<00:03:11.400> so

00:03:14.449 --> 00:03:14.459 
we're just going to go connect that yet

00:03:14.459 --> 00:03:17.360 
we're just going to go connect that yet
and<00:03:14.489> an<00:03:14.730> controller<00:03:15.209> connected<00:03:15.570> and<00:03:16.370> another

00:03:17.360 --> 00:03:17.370 
and an controller connected and another

00:03:17.370 --> 00:03:19.729 
and an controller connected and another
sound<00:03:17.880> actuator<00:03:18.420> this<00:03:18.720> is<00:03:18.840> obviously<00:03:19.019> for<00:03:19.709> the

00:03:19.729 --> 00:03:19.739 
sound actuator this is obviously for the

00:03:19.739 --> 00:03:22.009 
sound actuator this is obviously for the
cube<00:03:20.239> so<00:03:21.239> we're<00:03:21.450> going<00:03:21.540> to<00:03:21.630> open<00:03:21.720> another

00:03:22.009 --> 00:03:22.019 
cube so we're going to open another

00:03:22.019 --> 00:03:26.710 
cube so we're going to open another
sound<00:03:22.380> file<00:03:22.590> I<00:03:22.860> have<00:03:23.070> a<00:03:23.100> magic<00:03:23.489> wand<00:03:23.700> one<00:03:24.420> sound

00:03:26.710 --> 00:03:26.720 
sound file I have a magic wand one sound

00:03:26.720 --> 00:03:29.150 
sound file I have a magic wand one sound
alright<00:03:27.720> so<00:03:27.900> what<00:03:28.110> this<00:03:28.350> is<00:03:28.410> going<00:03:28.590> to<00:03:28.769> do<00:03:28.890> will

00:03:29.150 --> 00:03:29.160 
alright so what this is going to do will

00:03:29.160 --> 00:03:33.320 
alright so what this is going to do will
make<00:03:29.190> it<00:03:30.410> loop<00:03:31.410> stop<00:03:32.250> you<00:03:32.790> can<00:03:32.940> experiment

00:03:33.320 --> 00:03:33.330 
make it loop stop you can experiment

00:03:33.330 --> 00:03:37.670 
make it loop stop you can experiment
just<00:03:33.840> to<00:03:33.989> see<00:03:34.200> what<00:03:34.470> each<00:03:34.739> one<00:03:35.040> does<00:03:36.560> so<00:03:37.560> now

00:03:37.670 --> 00:03:37.680 
just to see what each one does so now

00:03:37.680 --> 00:03:39.680 
just to see what each one does so now
when<00:03:38.100> I<00:03:38.130> press<00:03:38.370> space<00:03:38.820> in<00:03:39.120> the<00:03:39.239> game<00:03:39.450> it's

00:03:39.680 --> 00:03:39.690 
when I press space in the game it's

00:03:39.690 --> 00:03:41.870 
when I press space in the game it's
going<00:03:39.930> to<00:03:39.989> play<00:03:40.170> this<00:03:40.350> sound<00:03:40.680> I'm<00:03:41.519> just<00:03:41.760> going

00:03:41.870 --> 00:03:41.880 
going to play this sound I'm just going

00:03:41.880 --> 00:03:43.780 
going to play this sound I'm just going
to<00:03:41.940> make<00:03:42.239> one<00:03:42.510> small<00:03:42.720> change<00:03:42.870> to<00:03:43.230> the<00:03:43.470> sound

00:03:43.780 --> 00:03:43.790 
to make one small change to the sound

00:03:43.790 --> 00:03:46.220 
to make one small change to the sound
time<00:03:44.790> to<00:03:44.910> go<00:03:45.030> background<00:03:45.720> sound<00:03:45.959> in<00:03:46.140> the

00:03:46.220 --> 00:03:46.230 
time to go background sound in the

00:03:46.230 --> 00:03:48.229 
time to go background sound in the
camera<00:03:46.530> I'm<00:03:46.650> just<00:03:46.799> going<00:03:46.920> to<00:03:46.950> set<00:03:47.250> it<00:03:47.280> to<00:03:47.459> 0.5

00:03:48.229 --> 00:03:48.239 
camera I'm just going to set it to 0.5

00:03:48.239 --> 00:03:51.699 
camera I'm just going to set it to 0.5
so<00:03:48.660> that<00:03:48.750> it<00:03:48.870> plays<00:03:49.049> at<00:03:49.320> lower<00:03:49.560> volume<00:03:50.390> so<00:03:51.390> now

00:03:51.699 --> 00:03:51.709 
so that it plays at lower volume so now

00:03:51.709 --> 00:03:54.920 
so that it plays at lower volume so now
let's<00:03:52.709> test<00:03:53.010> this<00:03:53.160> out<00:03:53.340> remember<00:03:54.330> space<00:03:54.660> would

00:03:54.920 --> 00:03:54.930 
let's test this out remember space would

00:03:54.930 --> 00:03:58.100 
let's test this out remember space would
play<00:03:55.170> the<00:03:55.470> magic<00:03:55.860> wand<00:03:56.160> sound<00:03:56.630> so<00:03:57.630> press<00:03:57.870> speed

00:03:58.100 --> 00:03:58.110 
play the magic wand sound so press speed

00:03:58.110 --> 00:04:01.370 
play the magic wand sound so press speed
a<00:03:58.200> test<00:03:58.519> here's<00:03:59.519> the<00:03:59.640> background<00:04:00.120> music<00:04:00.450> space

00:04:01.370 --> 00:04:01.380 
a test here's the background music space

00:04:01.380 --> 00:04:04.200 
a test here's the background music space
plays<00:04:01.709> the<00:04:01.890> sound
