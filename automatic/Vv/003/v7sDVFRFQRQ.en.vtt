00:01:00.430 --> 00:01:00.440 
of people have a hard time talking about

00:01:04.750 --> 00:01:04.760

think when you're in the middle of the

00:01:40.160 --> 00:01:42.330 
think when you're in the middle of the
storm<00:01:40.490> but<00:01:40.700> life<00:01:41.270> has<00:01:41.450> a<00:01:41.479> really<00:01:41.720> good<00:01:41.780> way<00:01:42.050> of

00:01:44.160 --> 00:01:44.170 
you know pointing in the right direction

00:01:44.170 --> 00:01:47.559 
you know pointing in the right direction
after<00:01:45.170> some<00:01:45.289> time<00:01:45.500> yeah<00:01:46.250> it<00:01:46.819> definitely<00:01:47.060> does

00:01:47.559 --> 00:01:47.569 
after some time yeah it definitely does

00:01:47.569 --> 00:01:50.800 
after some time yeah it definitely does

if<00:02:01.250> you<00:02:01.310> guys<00:02:01.429> have<00:02:01.610> that<00:02:01.759> here<00:02:01.940> we<00:02:02.030> call<00:02:02.179> it

00:02:02.260 --> 00:02:02.270 
if you guys have that here we call it

00:02:02.270 --> 00:02:04.690 
if you guys have that here we call it
gate<00:02:02.450> and<00:02:02.720> stuff<00:02:02.929> where<00:02:03.619> it's<00:02:03.800> like<00:02:03.950> them<00:02:04.459> I

00:02:04.690 --> 00:02:04.700 
gate and stuff where it's like them I

00:02:04.700 --> 00:02:07.419 
gate and stuff where it's like them I
guess<00:02:04.970> more<00:02:05.270> advanced<00:02:05.810> kids<00:02:06.110> go<00:02:06.860> to<00:02:06.920> school
