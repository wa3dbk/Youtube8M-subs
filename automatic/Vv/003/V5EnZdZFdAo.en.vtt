anything<00:04:35.500> you<00:04:35.530> could<00:04:35.770> probably<00:04:36.630> think<00:04:37.630> about

00:04:37.800 --> 00:04:37.810 
anything you could probably think about

00:04:37.810 --> 00:04:41.430

the<00:04:37.990> mystery<00:04:38.650> so<00:04:38.890> FJ<00:04:39.850> Lewis<00:04:40.300> because<00:04:41.020> of<00:04:41.350> the

00:04:41.430 --> 00:04:41.440 
the mystery so FJ Lewis because of the

00:04:41.440 --> 00:04:43.260 
the mystery so FJ Lewis because of the
kind<00:04:41.680> of<00:04:41.890> rhythm<00:04:42.250> that<00:04:42.580> he<00:04:42.760> had<00:04:42.910> during<00:04:43.180> the

00:04:43.260 --> 00:04:43.270 
kind of rhythm that he had during the

00:04:43.270 --> 00:04:47.120 
kind of rhythm that he had during the
first<00:04:43.630> quarter<00:04:43.810> he<00:04:44.230> was<00:04:44.350> really<00:04:44.680> awkward<00:04:44.860> and

00:04:47.120 --> 00:04:47.130 
first quarter he was really awkward and

00:04:47.130 --> 00:04:50.130 
first quarter he was really awkward and
so<00:04:48.130> it's<00:04:48.280> a<00:04:48.370> five-point<00:04:48.610> game<00:04:49.060> hill<00:04:49.810> in<00:04:49.930> favor

00:04:50.130 --> 00:04:50.140
