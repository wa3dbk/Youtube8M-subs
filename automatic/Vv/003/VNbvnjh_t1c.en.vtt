 He also has a car of the year 

00:03:40.260 --> 00:03:48.410
 very churrÃ­simo and the most important thing is 

00:03:42.769 --> 00:03:48.410
 lonely little boy sucks the homemade 

00:03:52.150 --> 00:03:58.379

00:04:15.550 --> 00:04:20.380
 see if all that wonder is true what 

00:04:17.739 --> 00:04:23.040
 it seems to them if we make a roll of 

00:04:20.380 --> 00:04:23.040
 letters 

00:04:36.100 --> 00:04:40.660

00:04:40.660 --> 00:04:43.840

00:04:42.340 --> 00:04:46.000
 very bad a lack of respect so 

00:04:43.840 --> 00:04:48.400
 You are punished or ask for permission to 

00:04:46.000 --> 00:04:51.420
 go out and play and do not make me face jaimito 

00:04:48.400 --> 00:04:51.420

00:04:54.420 --> 00:04:59.000
 what happens with the most daring 

00:04:59.960 --> 00:05:05.810
 but what did he say 

00:05:02.400 --> 00:05:05.810
 I want to remember forget 

00:05:06.409 --> 00:05:11.900
 apparently the doctor is enraptured 

00:05:08.469 --> 00:05:13.670
 with you and came to seek return 

00:05:11.900 --> 00:05:17.600
 from the room 

00:05:13.670 --> 00:05:22.720
 the clinic left happily 

00:05:17.600 --> 00:05:25.950
 and there are problems in paradise something like that 

00:05:22.720 --> 00:05:29.600
 let's talk 

00:05:25.950 --> 00:05:29.600
 in the end 

00:05:31.500 --> 00:05:36.120
 but because you do not want to get married in the 

00:05:33.270 --> 00:05:38.340
 beach I'm going to suffocate no no no no no 

00:05:36.120 --> 00:05:40.530
 yet not so hot well by 

00:05:38.340 --> 00:05:43.980
 the afternoons there is a cool wind that is 

00:05:40.530 --> 00:05:47.190
 normal speak no no I'm not going to be with 

00:05:43.980 --> 00:05:49.140

00:05:47.190 --> 00:05:52.530

00:05:49.140 --> 00:05:55.650
 it has to have a huge hallway what 

00:05:52.530 --> 00:05:57.900
 long where I can pass and tell me 

00:05:55.650 --> 00:06:01.440
 radiant that all the guests say 

00:05:57.900 --> 00:06:05.060
 that the child is fernanda in the girlfriend 

00:06:01.440 --> 00:06:07.639
 cutest I 've seen 

00:06:05.060 --> 00:06:10.189
 but something 

00:06:07.639 --> 00:06:13.350
 long ago I wanted to talk about this is 

00:06:10.189 --> 00:06:17.120
 ok but with a cool condition 

00:06:13.350 --> 00:06:17.120
 that the crazy hour be of star wars 

00:06:18.200 --> 00:06:21.370

00:06:29.350 --> 00:06:35.220

00:06:41.620 --> 00:06:48.340

 to take charge of replacing him during my 

00:06:53.350 --> 00:06:57.490
 absence I loved this term I 

00:06:55.750 --> 00:06:59.400
 It satisfies the idea that a 

00:06:57.490 --> 00:07:02.350
 unknown to work here in the house 

00:06:59.400 --> 00:07:04.690
 because you better call montserrat and you 

00:07:02.350 --> 00:07:07.090
 asks that he return that assures that 

00:07:04.690 --> 00:07:09.220
 I would gladly accept monserrat well 

00:07:07.090 --> 00:07:10.600
 first choice to replace Adam 

00:07:09.220 --> 00:07:13.150
 but you know you do not want 

00:07:10.600 --> 00:07:15.690
 risk your life I want to forget the 

00:07:13.150 --> 00:07:19.720
 past you understand me if I understand 

00:07:15.690 --> 00:07:23.710
 but that person that you recommend that 

00:07:19.720 --> 00:07:25.690
 Trust Peter never from a person who 

00:07:23.710 --> 00:07:28.900
 do not enjoy your mind the beloved trust 

00:07:25.690 --> 00:07:31.750
 good if you say it we will adapt and 

00:07:28.900 --> 00:07:33.700
 when he starts working tomorrow, he arrives 

00:07:31.750 --> 00:07:35.600
 in the afternoon and immediately put on their 

00:07:33.700 --> 00:07:38.770
 housework 

00:07:35.600 --> 00:07:38.770
 and where does it come from? 

00:07:41.030 --> 00:07:43.630
