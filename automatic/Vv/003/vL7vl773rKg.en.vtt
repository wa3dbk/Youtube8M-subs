 the Geo Truck Series 4 from Lintner gets the Geotrac 84 

00:00:42.600 --> 00:00:47.230
 even before the official presentation, we were able to find the new tractor in Kundel 

00:00:47.230 --> 00:00:50.230
 test drive 

00:00:53.970 --> 00:00:57.110

 high and weighs only 3,000 380 kilograms 

00:01:00.920 --> 00:01:04.479
 If this is a problem Lindner is on the larger models 

00:01:05.190 --> 00:01:11.450
 the Geotrac 84 has received a new bonnet and a new cabinet 

00:01:11.450 --> 00:01:14.450
 Wish there is a lower alpine cabin 

00:01:34.660 --> 00:01:38.760
 Under the hood, a four-cylinder Perkins engine works with 

00:01:38.760 --> 00:01:42.040
 common rail high pressure injection and 92 hp 

00:01:42.690 --> 00:01:46.250

 Let's take a look at the cabin 

00:02:00.880 --> 00:02:04.359
 Lindner drivers find a familiar environment here 

00:02:04.900 --> 00:02:11.350
 on our Geotrac 84, the standard cabin was built with a flat floor 

00:02:11.350 --> 00:02:16.030
 Looking forward, the new central info Porath with integrated tilt I falls 

00:02:16.030 --> 00:02:20.949
 They catch the eye that we've already seen on the Geotrac 94 

00:02:20.949 --> 00:02:25.589
 This allows a variety of functions to display and operate 

00:02:25.589 --> 00:02:30.759
 at the 84, the Tyrolean continue to replace the dual manual transmission 

00:02:30.759 --> 00:02:35.649
 from ZF Steier with 16 advances 16 reverse gears 

00:02:35.649 --> 00:02:40.369

00:02:44.609 --> 00:02:49.309
 right next to the bike are the known controls he for the 

00:02:49.309 --> 00:02:52.309
 Additional tax devices and the EM he was 

00:02:54.719 --> 00:03:00.709
 As standard, the Geotrac 84 comes with four panel speeds to the customer

00:03:07.499 --> 00:03:12.419
 The rear sash window ensures good view of the cultivation space and helps with 

00:03:12.419 --> 00:03:14.069

 Optionally, the PTO shaft and the engine speed can be controlled from the outside 

00:03:42.869 --> 00:03:49.139
 The front door has also been redesigned for the Geotrac 84 and 94 

00:03:49.139 --> 00:03:54.439
 It is very close to the axle and can be retrofitted at any time 

00:03:54.439 --> 00:03:59.739
 biggest mystery Indians have the lifting power from 2000 to 2500 kilograms 

00:03:59.739 --> 00:04:02.909
 elevated 

00:04:02.909 --> 00:04:08.430
 In addition to the Geotrac 84, Lindner also presented two new three-cylinder models 

00:04:08.430 --> 00:04:11.430
 the Geo Tracks 74 and 64 

00:04:12.239 --> 00:04:16.699
 for a better view forward was the brevity of the bonnet with the 

00:04:16.699 --> 00:04:20.189
 maintained conventional angular headlamps 

00:04:20.189 --> 00:04:26.300
 together with Geotags 94 and 84, these two models make up the new Geo

 Truck Series 4 Alpine 

00:04:35.249 --> 00:04:40.519
 Like the predecessors of the Series 3, the new Geotrac models are compact and lightweight 

00:04:40.519 --> 00:04:44.929
 agile but they have more power under the hood and offer one 

00:04:44.929 --> 00:04:46.499
 higher comfort 

00:04:46.499 --> 00:04:50.789
 so they have the stuff to continue to be Austria's bestseller in this the 

00:04:50.789 --> 00:04:52.059
 s-class to stay
