00:00:05.519 --> 00:00:10.990
 in the second round against us space marine and 

00:00:08.769 --> 00:00:17.250
 my favorite opponents 

00:00:10.990 --> 00:00:20.650
 we play against revan prepared from here 

00:00:17.250 --> 00:00:22.660
 the ancients contributed this account to this remote control 

00:00:20.650 --> 00:00:25.600
 dear ones stay for some very here 

00:00:22.660 --> 00:00:28.660
 we hid here and so as you can see 

00:00:25.600 --> 00:00:32.290
 This is a typical roster 5 power morons 

00:00:28.660 --> 00:00:35.589
 armor and they go to our trap 

00:00:32.290 --> 00:00:36.429
 The first move here did not fit the type 

00:00:35.589 --> 00:00:39.730
 raids 

00:00:36.429 --> 00:00:42.489
 tuning day dolma you tried here 

00:00:39.730 --> 00:00:43.420
 such a pig close our box of 

00:00:42.489 --> 00:00:46.539
 these scoundrels 

00:00:43.420 --> 00:00:50.230
 on the Swede stump well how typical there is 

00:00:46.539 --> 00:00:52.960
 couple of tricks types ray vanguard scout 

00:00:50.230 --> 00:00:57.179
 you can see this in ordinary games 

00:00:52.960 --> 00:01:00.909
 not and 30 pairs instead of her guys 

00:00:57.179 --> 00:01:04.300
 meanings 2 hot space marines court 

00:01:00.909 --> 00:01:07.659
 climb up we go too 

00:01:04.300 --> 00:01:10.180
 defend the day and walked the third hot space 

00:01:07.659 --> 00:01:15.540
 marine and and huddle like the last woman 

00:01:10.180 --> 00:01:18.539
 so we approached them so much and got out the ring and 

00:01:15.540 --> 00:01:21.070
 51 on hit units on spilling all 

00:01:18.539 --> 00:01:24.369
 it is time to force this thing somehow 

00:01:21.070 --> 00:01:27.640
 by the arrival it moved obstructed sit down 

00:01:24.369 --> 00:01:30.280
 them to bring your car gun edge 

00:01:27.640 --> 00:01:33.219
 they were afraid to deliver on these boys 

00:01:30.280 --> 00:01:37.149
 that they do not get out they fall apart well 

00:01:33.219 --> 00:01:38.859
 let's see we are ready to fight 4 

00:01:37.149 --> 00:01:42.159
 hot space marine finally climbed on 

00:01:38.859 --> 00:01:43.899
 balcony grenade left a bunch of little 

00:01:42.159 --> 00:01:45.969
 on the bolters fired incendiary 

00:01:43.899 --> 00:01:50.400
 removed the commander is still on the count guy 

00:01:45.969 --> 00:01:52.710
 steel there are thrown all 3 carpet for 

00:01:50.400 --> 00:01:56.220
 worries yes man is his one 

00:01:52.710 --> 00:01:59.160
 maintained did not kill 6 armor threw in 

00:01:56.220 --> 00:02:04.200
 the answer is no bag have rocket 

00:01:59.160 --> 00:02:05.340
 Sugar carpet 4 consultations and stale 

00:02:04.200 --> 00:02:08.940
 sees threw off 

00:02:05.340 --> 00:02:11.520
 nature wave deuce and they got caught 

00:02:08.940 --> 00:02:13.500
 our trap climbed such think now 

00:02:11.520 --> 00:02:16.140
 we throw them with grenades 

00:02:13.500 --> 00:02:18.720
 and there the fence is worth watching from the head 

00:02:16.140 --> 00:02:22.020
 space marine and he is just blocking 

00:02:18.720 --> 00:02:24.720
 we stenochki so pressed by the tick 

00:02:22.020 --> 00:02:26.400
 the fence will bounce then there shades where 

00:02:24.720 --> 00:02:29.670
 flew in general will shift 

00:02:26.400 --> 00:02:32.640
 so almost nobody was killed and move 

00:02:29.670 --> 00:02:33.860
 worthy simply pressed tablets 

00:02:32.640 --> 00:02:37.140
 stories 

00:02:33.860 --> 00:02:38.370
 stay because plasma threw out 2 

00:02:37.140 --> 00:02:40.260
 twos 

00:02:38.370 --> 00:02:44.600
 nature vine mastercraft per unit 

00:02:40.260 --> 00:02:47.820
 died and that 2212 we threw on it 

00:02:44.600 --> 00:02:51.120
 the autocannon hit once 

00:02:47.820 --> 00:02:54.630
 discard armor nothing at all bolters 

00:02:51.120 --> 00:02:57.570
 and that's just a snapshot has poker 

00:02:54.630 --> 00:03:00.360
 sawed out commander finn attacked here 

00:02:57.570 --> 00:03:02.820
 drinking dick he she killed we didn't 

00:03:00.360 --> 00:03:05.690
 were able to retreat all left alone 

00:03:02.820 --> 00:03:08.940
 dude you at least one more opal 

00:03:05.690 --> 00:03:12.060
 typical waha joke some one 

00:03:08.940 --> 00:03:14.070
 came out means so cultists healed 

00:03:12.060 --> 00:03:17.610
 pounced 1 what their account 

00:03:14.070 --> 00:03:22.610
 crucified fled who where and only 

00:03:17.610 --> 00:03:25.710
 bolter in the ring cooler enemy commander 

00:03:22.610 --> 00:03:31.500
 hot space marine of 5 

00:03:25.710 --> 00:03:36.580
 Another rocket struck not, and 2 are no rules 

00:03:31.500 --> 00:03:40.420
 here in the auto cannon one outcome ammunition 

00:03:36.580 --> 00:03:44.200
 overheated did not hit but survived simple 2 

00:03:40.420 --> 00:03:46.050
 nothing broke in hatha no no what 

00:03:44.200 --> 00:03:50.830
 kids already 26 

00:03:46.050 --> 00:03:53.200
 we got into the ring and shot and shot 

00:03:50.830 --> 00:03:56.320
 they shot no one in the pot 

00:03:53.200 --> 00:03:58.840
 Whether these would not even have found no 

00:03:56.320 --> 00:04:00.910
 just stupidly chardzh killed the dude 

00:03:58.840 --> 00:04:01.720
 one here soap still killed 

00:04:00.910 --> 00:04:04.980
 freed 

00:04:01.720 --> 00:04:08.050
 and the next move is strictly the opposite 

00:04:04.980 --> 00:04:10.420
 took the marina prize simply and were blown away 

00:04:08.050 --> 00:04:12.850
 Weiss Marina Brik tests passed this 

00:04:10.420 --> 00:04:14.650
 left I wanted to make this 

00:04:12.850 --> 00:04:19.299
 incendiary bum hit once 

00:04:14.650 --> 00:04:22.150
 did not break the chat you good stamina 

00:04:19.299 --> 00:04:25.180
 immediately mind the real negro your 

00:04:22.150 --> 00:04:30.040
 incendiary should have been hit poisoned a 

00:04:25.180 --> 00:04:32.200
 we here of paired bolter killed 

00:04:30.040 --> 00:04:34.919
 boy as always from the first wound but 

00:04:32.200 --> 00:04:36.610
 autocannons up backdoor to enemies could 

00:04:34.919 --> 00:04:39.610
 go on the attack 

00:04:36.610 --> 00:04:42.990
 tracker over the fence run and last 

00:04:39.610 --> 00:04:44.730
 the seventh entrance was cleaned 1 

00:04:42.990 --> 00:04:46.380
 very firmly not copper brik that is if 

00:04:44.730 --> 00:04:52.140
 rolls and 

00:04:46.380 --> 00:04:54.420
 Carpet mountain did not get here and we car 

00:04:52.140 --> 00:04:58.500
 his cats finally killed 2 wounds 

00:04:54.420 --> 00:05:00.000
 brought in catch it out adore wipe 

00:04:58.500 --> 00:05:06.030
 space marine 

00:05:00.000 --> 00:05:09.660
 Well, in the second game you can see that the autocannon 

00:05:06.030 --> 00:05:12.420
 so so so so well can not cope with 

00:05:09.660 --> 00:05:14.450
 such a task two shots 55 m m not 

00:05:12.420 --> 00:05:17.340
 hit did not break nothing happens 

00:05:14.450 --> 00:05:22.770
 armor throw technique to beat 

00:05:17.340 --> 00:05:25.680
 I also think that there with 4 5 5 never 4 for 

00:05:22.770 --> 00:05:28.950
 main 11 armor is not even a buzz 

00:05:25.680 --> 00:05:32.370
 fear to hit and pierce it how much 

00:05:28.950 --> 00:05:37.430
 moves to cut there something already carpets about 

00:05:32.370 --> 00:05:43.040
 and not enough 

00:05:37.430 --> 00:05:44.960
 not enough attack 3 spawn it yes it 

00:05:43.040 --> 00:05:48.980
 I came to eat but also happens of course 

00:05:44.960 --> 00:05:53.840
 will be there to throw one to repair such 

00:05:48.980 --> 00:05:56.600
 armor ie 11 kelso sparhok nothing 

00:05:53.840 --> 00:06:02.210
 does but no less like something 

00:05:56.600 --> 00:06:03.950
 there is and here are these 10 cultists that 

00:06:02.210 --> 00:06:06.200
 they can nothing can only meat 

00:06:03.950 --> 00:06:08.960
 really to stand on the other 

00:06:06.200 --> 00:06:10.790
 sides while my guys in the market are sitting 

00:06:08.960 --> 00:06:16.730
 you have to cut a stump 

00:06:10.790 --> 00:06:18.770
 here and then these come out and smear though all 

00:06:16.730 --> 00:06:20.900
 here we grind them very much 

00:06:18.770 --> 00:06:25.000
 I know no more still like to 

00:06:20.900 --> 00:06:25.000
 spam option and you
