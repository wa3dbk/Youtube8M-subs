00:01:06.549 --> 00:01:09.549
 Oh 

00:01:24.020 --> 00:01:26.469
 red red 

00:02:19.599 --> 00:02:25.879
 yes I think at times fine in second 

00:02:24.290 --> 00:02:28.550
 some phases really a lot of control 

00:02:25.879 --> 00:02:30.319
 had good feel was what the 

00:02:28.550 --> 00:02:31.610
 positive result but also phase that 

00:02:30.319 --> 00:02:33.200
 a lot of loss of the ball was sloppy 

00:02:31.610 --> 00:02:34.370
 had and 

00:02:33.200 --> 00:02:35.660
 well i look now we want what goes 

00:02:34.370 --> 00:02:38.239
 mean a competition then must 

00:02:35.660 --> 00:02:39.830
 sloppiness out and yes we still have 

00:02:38.239 --> 00:02:41.209
 one more for each day 

00:02:39.830 --> 00:02:42.830
 and what can you do about the opponent 

00:02:41.209 --> 00:02:46.340
 tell them it's spanish second 

00:02:42.830 --> 00:02:48.110
 division b believe that means yes 

00:02:46.340 --> 00:02:49.879
 it is similar to 

00:02:48.110 --> 00:02:51.260
 with the opponent i think we like that 

00:02:49.879 --> 00:02:57.650
 we had last week with the 

00:02:51.260 --> 00:02:59.000
 with genemuiden was reasonable but not 

00:02:57.650 --> 00:03:01.280
 the level that we are used to now 

00:02:59.000 --> 00:03:02.599
 few stop playing then this is 

00:03:01.280 --> 00:03:03.769
 level many times eyes 

00:03:02.599 --> 00:03:05.180
 yes it was more like a knife that we 

00:03:03.769 --> 00:03:06.829
 actually much possession had the 

00:03:05.180 --> 00:03:09.769
 had to make a game in advance 

00:03:06.829 --> 00:03:11.599
 ambition but yes no de 

00:03:09.769 --> 00:03:13.220
 opposition was not so much 

00:03:11.599 --> 00:03:15.230
 but actually that good for us 

00:03:13.220 --> 00:03:17.780
 Party has been around for a tasty in 

00:03:15.230 --> 00:03:19.760
 to play and to beat and they do that 

00:03:17.780 --> 00:03:21.829
 there is a nice one yesterday 

00:03:19.760 --> 00:03:24.170
 arrived here in spain is nice to 

00:03:21.829 --> 00:03:25.940
 to play a match right away 

00:03:24.170 --> 00:03:27.440
 there must say actually because you yes 

00:03:25.940 --> 00:03:28.760
 course workouts that is nice if you 

00:03:27.440 --> 00:03:30.530
 powerpark have trained over one 

00:03:28.760 --> 00:03:32.900
 match is playing but where there this morning 

00:03:30.530 --> 00:03:34.220
 well trained and not too hard someone 

00:03:32.900 --> 00:03:36.769
 had a wetsuit then 

00:03:34.220 --> 00:03:38.359
 and from the match so it went fine 

00:03:36.769 --> 00:03:39.739
 you arrived yesterday then 

00:03:38.359 --> 00:03:41.299
 nice to be right the day after 

00:03:39.739 --> 00:03:44.090
 play a game 

00:03:41.299 --> 00:03:45.410
 yes absolutely i mean i have to be honest 

00:03:44.090 --> 00:03:47.540
 say that i am the first game that i 

00:03:45.410 --> 00:03:49.010
 reports a little more effort there because that is 

00:03:47.540 --> 00:03:50.389
 you train one day and one again 

00:03:49.010 --> 00:03:52.880
 playing a match I thought so 

00:03:50.389 --> 00:03:55.730
 heavier but yes white tasty 

00:03:52.880 --> 00:03:57.769
 the fields are not good so 

00:03:55.730 --> 00:03:59.360
 yes if you have to train with two or you 

00:03:57.769 --> 00:04:02.360
 picks up a competition and so does the training 

00:03:59.360 --> 00:04:04.700
 eh I think this is for grace 

00:04:02.360 --> 00:04:06.260
 for almost every swim you see a lot 

00:04:04.700 --> 00:04:08.750
 smiling faces all the time is beautiful 

00:04:06.260 --> 00:04:11.239
 Feyenoord again and how you how 

00:04:08.750 --> 00:04:13.400
 your first day fall me 

00:04:11.239 --> 00:04:15.349
 yes very well actually what i just already though 

00:04:13.400 --> 00:04:17.359
 about this you know the accommodation is 

00:04:15.349 --> 00:04:19.280
 just great 

00:04:17.359 --> 00:04:21.530
 so lots of rest that you follow to 

00:04:19.280 --> 00:04:23.960
 are among the only people in the hotel 

00:04:21.530 --> 00:04:25.760
 what is sometimes nice you will not be 

00:04:23.960 --> 00:04:27.620
 addressed too much and you can just do it 

00:04:25.760 --> 00:04:30.110
 do your own thing 

00:04:27.620 --> 00:04:32.150
 as a team and yes it often is this kind 

00:04:30.110 --> 00:04:36.590
 things where as a team it's good for that 

00:04:32.150 --> 00:04:37.910
 you become a monastery with each other and ten 

00:04:36.590 --> 00:04:38.870
 least the beginning of the week end of the 

00:04:37.910 --> 00:04:41.000
 week will be the 

00:04:38.870 --> 00:04:42.440
 maybe a little less and with that 

00:04:41.000 --> 00:04:43.760
 put the room down 

00:04:42.440 --> 00:04:46.360
 I walk we must lie with the three of them 

00:04:43.760 --> 00:04:48.889
 away with that i put a kakuta in front 

00:04:46.360 --> 00:04:51.620
 cozy yes I also have two more 

00:04:48.889 --> 00:04:52.070
 men that room so but you know me 

00:04:51.620 --> 00:04:56.690
 lie with 

00:04:52.070 --> 00:04:58.160
 with nicky and with simon so i could do the 

00:04:56.690 --> 00:05:00.710
 bad hit nigger 

00:04:58.160 --> 00:05:03.250
 experience together in a room yes actually 

00:05:00.710 --> 00:05:05.300
 well i think we are the oldies and 

00:05:03.250 --> 00:05:06.410
 maybe that's what I did some scholarship 

00:05:05.300 --> 00:05:08.360
 because it all takes a little longer 

00:05:06.410 --> 00:05:10.220
 before we i feel ours 

00:05:08.360 --> 00:05:12.229
 week 20 was also a fifteen 

00:05:10.220 --> 00:05:15.530
 rather that we slowly get going 

00:05:12.229 --> 00:05:18.490
 but yeah I guess that there buses 

00:05:15.530 --> 00:05:18.490
 conscious choices you
