that it will but if it does it can be
replaced<00:01:14.610> for<00:01:15.000> up<00:01:15.090> to<00:01:15.240> a<00:01:15.270> year<00:01:15.650> number<00:01:16.650> two

replaced for up to a year number two

00:01:16.830 --> 00:01:19.190 
replaced for up to a year number two
it's<00:01:17.040> 40%<00:01:17.759> thinner<00:01:17.970> than<00:01:18.330> most<00:01:18.570> other<00:01:18.869> glass

00:01:19.190 --> 00:01:19.200 
it's 40% thinner than most other glass

00:01:19.200 --> 00:01:20.990 
it's 40% thinner than most other glass
screen<00:01:19.560> protectors<00:01:20.040> so<00:01:20.280> for<00:01:20.460> example<00:01:20.850> the

00:01:20.990 --> 00:01:21.000 
screen protectors so for example the

00:01:21.000 --> 00:01:23.149 
screen protectors so for example the
bodyguards<00:01:21.600> glass<00:01:21.900> screen<00:01:22.259> protector<00:01:22.710> is

00:01:23.149 --> 00:01:23.159 
bodyguards glass screen protector is

00:01:23.159 --> 00:01:24.980 
bodyguards glass screen protector is
actually<00:01:23.580> 40<00:01:23.909> percent<00:01:24.299> thinner<00:01:24.479> and<00:01:24.720> we<00:01:24.810> found

00:01:24.980 --> 00:01:24.990 
actually 40 percent thinner and we found

00:01:24.990 --> 00:01:27.140 
actually 40 percent thinner and we found
it<00:01:25.170> to<00:01:25.229> be<00:01:25.259> just<00:01:25.560> as<00:01:25.799> protective<00:01:26.400> so<00:01:27.000> that's

00:01:27.140 --> 00:01:27.150 
it to be just as protective so that's

00:01:27.150 --> 00:01:29.359 
it to be just as protective so that's
nice<00:01:27.390> when<00:01:27.630> you<00:01:27.750> have<00:01:27.930> cases<00:01:28.590> like<00:01:29.070> I<00:01:29.100> have

00:01:29.359 --> 00:01:29.369 
nice when you have cases like I have

00:01:29.369 --> 00:01:31.340 
nice when you have cases like I have
here<00:01:29.790> that<00:01:30.329> it's<00:01:30.479> still<00:01:30.689> going<00:01:30.720> to<00:01:30.960> work<00:01:31.140> with

00:01:31.340 --> 00:01:31.350 
here that it's still going to work with

00:01:31.350 --> 00:01:33.020 
here that it's still going to work with
that<00:01:31.380> and<00:01:31.799> it<00:01:32.040> doesn't<00:01:32.189> have<00:01:32.400> a<00:01:32.430> huge<00:01:32.670> rim

00:01:33.020 --> 00:01:33.030 
that and it doesn't have a huge rim

00:01:33.030 --> 00:01:35.390 
that and it doesn't have a huge rim
especially<00:01:33.630> around<00:01:33.960> the<00:01:34.229> home<00:01:34.500> button<00:01:34.890> it's

00:01:35.390 --> 00:01:35.400 
especially around the home button it's

00:01:35.400 --> 00:01:37.310 
especially around the home button it's
so<00:01:35.790> that<00:01:35.939> way<00:01:36.090> it's<00:01:36.240> not<00:01:36.390> a<00:01:36.450> big<00:01:36.720> deep<00:01:36.960> hole

00:01:37.310 --> 00:01:37.320 
so that way it's not a big deep hole

00:01:37.320 --> 00:01:40.069 
so that way it's not a big deep hole
with<00:01:37.740> that<00:01:37.770> screen<00:01:38.430> protector<00:01:38.970> built<00:01:39.630> up<00:01:39.869> so

00:01:40.069 --> 00:01:40.079 
with that screen protector built up so

00:01:40.079 --> 00:01:41.780 
with that screen protector built up so
it's<00:01:40.200> 40<00:01:40.500> percent<00:01:40.650> thinner<00:01:41.070> which<00:01:41.340> is<00:01:41.520> quite

00:01:41.780 --> 00:01:41.790 
it's 40 percent thinner which is quite

full<00:04:04.549> touch<00:04:04.790> sensitivity<00:04:05.359> and<00:04:05.720> then<00:04:05.840> it's

00:04:05.979 --> 00:04:05.989 
full touch sensitivity and then it's

00:04:05.989 --> 00:04:07.660 
full touch sensitivity and then it's

resists<00:04:23.840> fingerprints<00:04:24.320> I<00:04:24.590> found<00:04:25.130> it<00:04:25.280> to<00:04:25.370> be

00:04:25.390 --> 00:04:25.400 
resists fingerprints I found it to be

00:04:25.400 --> 00:04:27.219 
resists fingerprints I found it to be
just<00:04:25.759> slightly<00:04:25.970> better<00:04:26.539> than<00:04:26.870> just<00:04:27.080> the

00:04:27.219 --> 00:04:27.229 
just slightly better than just the

00:04:27.229 --> 00:04:29.529 
just slightly better than just the
regular<00:04:27.350> iPhone<00:04:27.949> you<00:04:28.729> may<00:04:28.880> be<00:04:28.940> able<00:04:29.090> to<00:04:29.240> see<00:04:29.419> it

00:04:29.529 --> 00:04:29.539 
regular iPhone you may be able to see it

00:04:29.539 --> 00:04:30.850 
regular iPhone you may be able to see it
does<00:04:29.750> still<00:04:30.110> get<00:04:30.320> a<00:04:30.350> little<00:04:30.500> bit<00:04:30.740> of

00:04:30.850 --> 00:04:30.860 
does still get a little bit of

00:04:30.860 --> 00:04:33.219 
does still get a little bit of
fingerprints<00:04:31.520> but<00:04:32.090> it<00:04:32.240> does<00:04:32.389> resist<00:04:32.840> it<00:04:33.020> more

00:04:33.219 --> 00:04:33.229 
fingerprints but it does resist it more

00:04:33.229 --> 00:04:35.770 
fingerprints but it does resist it more
than<00:04:33.470> just<00:04:33.680> the<00:04:33.830> naked<00:04:34.009> iPhone<00:04:34.610> screen<00:04:35.000> so<00:04:35.419> it

00:04:35.770 --> 00:04:35.780 
than just the naked iPhone screen so it

00:04:35.780 --> 00:04:37.779 
than just the naked iPhone screen so it
is<00:04:35.990> nice<00:04:36.229> a<00:04:36.259> great<00:04:36.650> little<00:04:36.979> addition<00:04:37.070> to<00:04:37.610> it

00:04:37.779 --> 00:04:37.789 
is nice a great little addition to it

00:04:37.789 --> 00:04:40.779 
is nice a great little addition to it

00:04:42.620 --> 00:04:44.650 
protector out there on the market it's
gonna<00:04:42.710> work<00:04:42.949> great<00:04:43.130> with<00:04:43.430> cases<00:04:43.940> as<00:04:44.120> well<00:04:44.330> and

00:04:44.650 --> 00:04:44.660 
gonna work great with cases as well and

00:04:44.660 --> 00:04:46.930 
gonna work great with cases as well and
it<00:04:45.139> does<00:04:45.350> have<00:04:45.560> a<00:04:45.590> gradual<00:04:46.130> tapering<00:04:46.639> of<00:04:46.789> the
