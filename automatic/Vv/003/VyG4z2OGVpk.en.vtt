00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:07.220
 hi girls today let's prepare one together 

00:00:02.970 --> 00:00:07.220
 donut with chocolate chips 

00:00:12.770 --> 00:00:21.060
 for drugs 150 g of sugar are needed 

00:00:17.130 --> 00:00:25.710
 150 g of dark chocolate 

00:00:21.060 --> 00:00:29.970
 cut into large pieces 100 g of butter 400 

00:00:25.710 --> 00:00:32.369
 g of flour a packet of yeast and 

00:00:29.970 --> 00:00:34.050
 milk that's enough for the moment 

00:00:32.369 --> 00:00:35.970
 I then prepared a glass 

00:00:34.050 --> 00:00:38.760
 we'll see in the course of the recipe 

00:00:35.970 --> 00:00:45.359
 let's start by melting the butter 

00:00:38.760 --> 00:00:49.430
 on a very sweet fire while the 

00:00:45.359 --> 00:00:49.430
 butter melts we sift the flour 

00:01:02.059 --> 00:01:05.600
 add the yeast 

00:01:09.690 --> 00:01:12.440
 sugar 

00:01:17.310 --> 00:01:20.689
 and we wait as pure yes indeed 

00:01:21.230 --> 00:01:26.690
 we take our butter now it is 

00:01:23.870 --> 00:01:29.440
 loose and over we are above ours 

00:01:26.690 --> 00:01:29.440
 elements 7 

00:01:34.680 --> 00:01:37.280
 we mix well 

00:01:39.550 --> 00:01:42.690
 add the milk 

00:01:51.490 --> 00:01:56.600
 since the dough is enough 

00:01:54.320 --> 00:01:59.380
 supported we pass to the processing with 

00:01:56.600 --> 00:01:59.380
 a spatula 

00:02:10.410 --> 00:02:15.110
 add another half a glass of 

00:02:12.180 --> 00:02:15.110
 milk in my case 

00:02:22.819 --> 00:02:27.909
 and last we put the scales of 

00:02:25.249 --> 00:02:27.909
 chocolate 

00:02:34.819 --> 00:02:37.030
 for me 

00:02:49.880 --> 00:02:53.990
 our dough is ready now we can 

00:02:52.160 --> 00:02:56.420
 put it in a cake tin shaped 

00:02:53.990 --> 00:02:59.230
 donut which obviously must first 

00:02:56.420 --> 00:02:59.230
 butter 

00:03:21.020 --> 00:03:27.080
 always with the help of your spatula 

00:03:24.490 --> 00:03:33.170
 spread the dough well over the whole 

00:03:27.080 --> 00:03:36.560
 pan when done this we can 

00:03:33.170 --> 00:03:41.870
 Bake in a hot oven at 180 degrees for 

00:03:36.560 --> 00:03:43.640
 about 30 minutes ours 

00:03:41.870 --> 00:03:45.290
 donut matters I recommend you 

00:03:43.640 --> 00:03:46.340
 eat it in the morning at breakfast with one 

00:03:45.290 --> 00:03:48.230
 nice cup of milk 

00:03:46.340 --> 00:03:49.700
