because<00:00:39.870> of<00:00:40.019> that<00:00:40.140> I<00:00:40.289> decided<00:00:40.499> I<00:00:40.890> would<00:00:40.949> go<00:00:41.129> to

00:00:41.149 --> 00:00:41.159 
because of that I decided I would go to

00:00:41.159 --> 00:00:43.309 
because of that I decided I would go to
the<00:00:41.399> left<00:00:41.609> and<00:00:42.359> kind<00:00:42.629> of<00:00:42.690> come<00:00:42.809> to<00:00:42.989> the<00:00:43.079> side<00:00:43.289> of

the left and kind of come to the side of

00:00:43.319 --> 00:00:45.649 
the left and kind of come to the side of
them<00:00:43.679> turns<00:00:44.489> out<00:00:44.609> he<00:00:44.850> backed<00:00:45.059> up<00:00:45.239> even<00:00:45.479> more

00:00:45.649 --> 00:00:45.659 
them turns out he backed up even more

00:00:45.659 --> 00:00:48.590 
them turns out he backed up even more
into<00:00:45.960> the<00:00:46.079> hallway<00:00:46.289> so<00:00:47.159> if<00:00:47.850> you<00:00:47.999> do<00:00:48.120> that<00:00:48.329> he'll

00:00:48.590 --> 00:00:48.600

sneak in sneak out the other two
invisible<00:01:51.060> guys<00:01:51.479> I'm<00:01:52.229> also<00:01:52.439> felt<00:01:52.770> certain

00:01:53.029 --> 00:01:53.039 
invisible guys I'm also felt certain

00:01:53.039 --> 00:01:56.149

that<00:01:53.189> the<00:01:53.340> guy<00:01:53.929> assassinated<00:01:55.039> can<00:01:56.039> go

00:01:56.149 --> 00:01:56.159 
that the guy assassinated can go

00:01:56.159 --> 00:01:57.739 
that the guy assassinated can go
invisible<00:01:56.429> as<00:01:56.789> well<00:01:56.969> so<00:01:57.270> if<00:01:57.329> you<00:01:57.390> don't<00:01:57.570> kill

here<00:03:57.000> that<00:03:57.269> was<00:03:57.450> happening<00:03:57.900> pretty<00:03:58.400> regularly

00:04:00.039 --> 00:04:00.049 
here that was happening pretty regularly

00:04:00.049 --> 00:04:02.270 
here that was happening pretty regularly
also<00:04:01.049> in<00:04:01.139> this<00:04:01.230> room<00:04:01.470> has<00:04:01.650> spawned<00:04:01.889> ammo

00:04:02.270 --> 00:04:02.280 
also in this room has spawned ammo

00:04:02.280 --> 00:04:04.759 
also in this room has spawned ammo
crates<00:04:02.579> and<00:04:02.880> healthgrades<00:04:03.380> there's<00:04:04.380> pistols

00:04:04.759 --> 00:04:04.769 
crates and healthgrades there's pistols

00:04:04.769 --> 00:04:07.160 
crates and healthgrades there's pistols
here<00:04:05.160> as<00:04:05.790> well<00:04:06.000> as<00:04:06.180> I<00:04:06.299> think<00:04:06.480> a<00:04:06.540> shotgun<00:04:06.989> right

00:04:07.160 --> 00:04:07.170 
here as well as I think a shotgun right

00:04:07.170 --> 00:04:11.120 
here as well as I think a shotgun right
there<00:04:08.299> my<00:04:09.299> suggestion<00:04:09.720> is<00:04:09.930> to<00:04:09.989> use<00:04:10.200> a<00:04:10.230> DMR<00:04:10.769> and

00:04:11.120 --> 00:04:11.130 
there my suggestion is to use a DMR and

00:04:11.130 --> 00:04:14.150 
there my suggestion is to use a DMR and
a<00:04:11.160> pistol<00:04:11.850> or<00:04:12.269> green<00:04:12.630> gun<00:04:12.870> I'll<00:04:13.200> probably<00:04:13.799> keep

00:04:14.150 --> 00:04:14.160 
a pistol or green gun I'll probably keep

00:04:14.160 --> 00:04:15.800 
a pistol or green gun I'll probably keep
the<00:04:14.310> green<00:04:14.519> gun<00:04:14.700> but<00:04:15.120> i<00:04:15.180> believe<00:04:15.239> i<00:04:15.540> switch

00:04:15.800 --> 00:04:15.810 
the green gun but i believe i switch

00:04:15.810 --> 00:04:20.560 
the green gun but i believe i switch
everything<00:04:16.109> out<00:04:16.410> for<00:04:16.440> a<00:04:18.470> DMR<00:04:19.470> and<00:04:19.799> a<00:04:19.859> sniper

00:04:20.560 --> 00:04:20.570 
everything out for a DMR and a sniper

00:04:20.570 --> 00:04:24.800 
everything out for a DMR and a sniper
which<00:04:21.570> works<00:04:21.840> out<00:04:22.220> but<00:04:23.220> i<00:04:23.669> think<00:04:24.539> your<00:04:24.630> green

00:04:24.800 --> 00:04:24.810 
which works out but i think your green

00:04:24.810 --> 00:04:27.350 
which works out but i think your green
one<00:04:24.930> would<00:04:25.020> probably<00:04:25.440> be<00:04:25.590> better<00:04:26.210> now<00:04:27.210> what<00:04:27.300> I

00:04:27.350 --> 00:04:27.360 
one would probably be better now what I

00:04:27.360 --> 00:04:29.390 
one would probably be better now what I
do<00:04:27.419> is<00:04:27.539> this<00:04:27.780> checkpoint<00:04:28.020> is<00:04:28.380> I<00:04:28.500> run<00:04:28.740> up<00:04:28.860> to<00:04:29.070> a

00:04:29.390 --> 00:04:29.400 
do is this checkpoint is I run up to a

00:04:29.400 --> 00:04:29.959 
do is this checkpoint is I run up to a

00:05:11.600 --> 00:05:11.610 
of spawn in those positions and in waves

00:05:11.610 --> 00:05:15.679

like that easy wave middle wave and then
a<00:05:15.719> really<00:05:15.899> hard<00:05:16.199> wave<00:05:16.849> so<00:05:17.849> once<00:05:18.029> you<00:05:18.089> take<00:05:18.269> out

00:05:18.379 --> 00:05:18.389 
a really hard wave so once you take out

00:06:07.770 --> 00:06:09.440 
but sometimes it get kind of scared to
elites<00:06:08.100> falling<00:06:08.490> with<00:06:08.640> this<00:06:08.790> one<00:06:08.970> as<00:06:09.120> well<00:06:09.210> as

00:06:09.440 --> 00:06:09.450 
elites falling with this one as well as

00:06:09.450 --> 00:06:12.440 
elites falling with this one as well as
you<00:06:09.600> can<00:06:09.750> see<00:06:09.960> um<00:06:10.790> this<00:06:11.790> is<00:06:11.970> the<00:06:12.090> disadvantage

00:06:12.440 --> 00:06:12.450 
you can see um this is the disadvantage

00:06:12.450 --> 00:06:15.590 
you can see um this is the disadvantage
of<00:06:13.050> being<00:06:13.140> up<00:06:13.650> ty<00:06:13.950> is<00:06:14.310> that<00:06:14.520> if<00:06:14.970> two<00:06:15.150> elites<00:06:15.420> get

00:06:15.590 --> 00:06:15.600 
of being up ty is that if two elites get

00:06:15.600 --> 00:06:18.170 
of being up ty is that if two elites get
up<00:06:15.690> here<00:06:15.900> and<00:06:15.930> kind<00:06:16.320> of<00:06:16.470> a<00:06:16.760> boxy<00:06:17.760> in<00:06:17.850> like<00:06:18.030> this

00:06:18.170 --> 00:06:18.180 
up here and kind of a boxy in like this

00:06:18.180 --> 00:06:22.130 
up here and kind of a boxy in like this
you<00:06:18.360> got<00:06:18.510> nowhere<00:06:18.690> to<00:06:18.900> go<00:06:20.180> to<00:06:21.180> kind<00:06:21.420> of<00:06:21.480> outlast

00:06:22.130 --> 00:06:22.140 
you got nowhere to go to kind of outlast

00:06:22.140 --> 00:06:23.660 
you got nowhere to go to kind of outlast
them<00:06:22.350> and<00:06:22.500> get<00:06:22.590> your<00:06:22.710> shield<00:06:22.950> back<00:06:23.160> luckily

00:06:23.660 --> 00:06:23.670 
them and get your shield back luckily

00:06:23.670 --> 00:06:25.160 
them and get your shield back luckily
they<00:06:23.820> split<00:06:24.180> off<00:06:24.330> and<00:06:24.360> allowed<00:06:24.780> me<00:06:24.810> to<00:06:25.020> get

00:06:25.160 --> 00:06:25.170 
they split off and allowed me to get

00:06:25.170 --> 00:06:27.820 
they split off and allowed me to get
into<00:06:25.290> that<00:06:25.380> little<00:06:26.250> hole<00:06:26.550> right<00:06:26.580> here<00:06:26.820> but<00:06:27.270> I

00:06:27.820 --> 00:06:27.830 
into that little hole right here but I

00:06:27.830 --> 00:06:29.870 
into that little hole right here but I
don't<00:06:28.830> know<00:06:28.980> if<00:06:29.070> I<00:06:29.130> would<00:06:29.190> bank<00:06:29.460> on<00:06:29.610> that<00:06:29.640> one

00:06:29.870 --> 00:06:29.880 
don't know if I would bank on that one

00:06:29.880 --> 00:06:33.140 
don't know if I would bank on that one
too<00:06:30.000> much<00:06:31.160> but<00:06:32.160> this<00:06:32.250> is<00:06:32.400> why<00:06:32.550> I<00:06:32.610> think<00:06:32.940> keeping

00:06:33.140 --> 00:06:33.150 
too much but this is why I think keeping

00:06:33.150 --> 00:06:35.090 
too much but this is why I think keeping
the<00:06:33.360> green<00:06:33.570> gun<00:06:33.780> subscriber<00:06:34.410> would<00:06:34.650> probably

00:06:35.090 --> 00:06:35.100 
the green gun subscriber would probably

00:06:35.100 --> 00:06:37.580 
the green gun subscriber would probably
be<00:06:35.220> more<00:06:35.400> useful<00:06:35.640> because<00:06:36.450> I<00:06:37.020> could<00:06:37.500> have

00:06:37.580 --> 00:06:37.590 
be more useful because I could have

00:06:37.590 --> 00:06:39.020 
be more useful because I could have
gotten<00:06:37.770> out<00:06:37.860> of<00:06:37.920> the<00:06:38.070> situation<00:06:38.280> a<00:06:38.700> lot<00:06:38.820> easier

00:06:39.020 --> 00:06:39.030 
gotten out of the situation a lot easier

00:06:39.030 --> 00:06:40.640 
gotten out of the situation a lot easier
if<00:06:39.390> I<00:06:39.480> died<00:06:39.540> had<00:06:39.720> a<00:06:39.750> green<00:06:40.020> gun<00:06:40.230> instead<00:06:40.440> of<00:06:40.590> a

00:06:40.640 --> 00:06:40.650 
if I died had a green gun instead of a

00:06:40.650 --> 00:06:48.090 
if I died had a green gun instead of a
sniper<00:06:40.860> rifle

00:06:48.090 --> 00:06:48.100 

00:06:48.100 --> 00:06:50.730 

now<00:06:48.940> for<00:06:49.150> this<00:06:49.240> next<00:06:49.300> wave<00:06:49.750> what<00:06:50.200> I<00:06:50.380> recommend

00:06:50.730 --> 00:06:50.740 
now for this next wave what I recommend

00:06:50.740 --> 00:06:52.830 
now for this next wave what I recommend
to<00:06:51.130> do<00:06:51.280> is<00:06:51.580> to<00:06:51.760> jump<00:06:52.000> down<00:06:52.150> behind<00:06:52.360> the<00:06:52.570> plane

00:06:52.830 --> 00:06:52.840 
to do is to jump down behind the plane

00:06:52.840 --> 00:06:57.210 
to do is to jump down behind the plane
and<00:06:53.350> go<00:06:53.560> pick<00:06:53.740> up<00:06:53.830> a<00:06:53.950> green<00:06:54.190> gun<00:06:55.560> also<00:06:56.560> pick<00:06:57.100> up

00:06:57.210 --> 00:06:57.220 
and go pick up a green gun also pick up

00:06:57.220 --> 00:06:59.580 
and go pick up a green gun also pick up
the<00:06:57.370> hell<00:06:57.550> that<00:06:57.760> spawns<00:06:58.030> down<00:06:58.270> here<00:06:58.630> and<00:06:58.810> I

00:06:59.580 --> 00:06:59.590 
the hell that spawns down here and I

00:06:59.590 --> 00:07:01.470 
the hell that spawns down here and I
don't<00:06:59.650> usually<00:07:00.430> recommend<00:07:00.730> it<00:07:01.120> but<00:07:01.210> I<00:07:01.270> would

00:07:01.470 --> 00:07:01.480 
don't usually recommend it but I would

00:07:01.480 --> 00:07:03.330 
don't usually recommend it but I would
probably<00:07:01.630> pick<00:07:02.020> up<00:07:02.140> the<00:07:02.260> armor<00:07:02.530> lock<00:07:02.710> this

00:07:03.330 --> 00:07:03.340 
probably pick up the armor lock this

00:07:03.340 --> 00:07:06.360 
probably pick up the armor lock this
wave<00:07:03.580> is<00:07:03.610> all<00:07:03.940> elites<00:07:04.300> they're<00:07:05.260> all<00:07:05.440> over<00:07:05.890> the

00:07:06.360 --> 00:07:06.370 
wave is all elites they're all over the

00:07:06.370 --> 00:07:08.520 
wave is all elites they're all over the
place<00:07:06.400> and<00:07:07.030> they<00:07:07.630> love<00:07:07.840> to<00:07:07.870> throw<00:07:08.110> grenades

00:07:08.520 --> 00:07:08.530 
place and they love to throw grenades

00:07:08.530 --> 00:07:10.770 
place and they love to throw grenades
and<00:07:08.920> they<00:07:09.130> have<00:07:09.340> the<00:07:09.610> sticky<00:07:10.000> launcher<00:07:10.480> and

00:07:10.770 --> 00:07:10.780 
and they have the sticky launcher and

00:07:10.780 --> 00:07:13.200 
and they have the sticky launcher and
they<00:07:10.990> have<00:07:11.200> yellow<00:07:11.560> rockets<00:07:12.100> and<00:07:12.430> I<00:07:12.880> just<00:07:13.060> have

00:07:13.200 --> 00:07:13.210 
they have yellow rockets and I just have

00:07:13.210 --> 00:07:17.940 
they have yellow rockets and I just have
balls<00:07:13.480> so<00:07:14.940> using<00:07:15.940> armor<00:07:16.660> lock<00:07:16.840> you<00:07:17.560> can<00:07:17.770> get

00:07:17.940 --> 00:07:17.950 
balls so using armor lock you can get

00:07:17.950 --> 00:07:20.670 
balls so using armor lock you can get
out<00:07:18.100> of<00:07:18.130> a<00:07:18.580> lot<00:07:18.970> of<00:07:19.090> situations<00:07:19.440> there's<00:07:20.440> three

00:07:20.670 --> 00:07:20.680 
out of a lot of situations there's three

00:07:20.680 --> 00:07:22.380 
out of a lot of situations there's three
situations<00:07:21.310> already<00:07:21.490> that<00:07:21.820> I<00:07:21.850> should<00:07:22.090> be<00:07:22.210> dead

00:07:22.380 --> 00:07:22.390 
situations already that I should be dead

00:07:22.390 --> 00:07:24.230 
situations already that I should be dead
in<00:07:22.570> that<00:07:22.720> armor<00:07:22.990> lock<00:07:23.140> has<00:07:23.290> helped<00:07:23.530> me<00:07:23.590> out<00:07:23.620> so

00:07:24.230 --> 00:07:24.240 
in that armor lock has helped me out so

00:07:24.240 --> 00:07:28.200 
in that armor lock has helped me out so
that's<00:07:25.240> why<00:07:25.450> I<00:07:25.480> would<00:07:25.660> say<00:07:25.810> go<00:07:25.960> get<00:07:26.170> it<00:07:26.320> and<00:07:27.210> can

00:07:28.200 --> 00:07:28.210 
that's why I would say go get it and can

00:07:28.210 --> 00:07:29.760 
that's why I would say go get it and can
I<00:07:28.240> move<00:07:28.510> back<00:07:28.570> into<00:07:28.930> your<00:07:29.080> position<00:07:29.470> where<00:07:29.650> you

00:07:29.760 --> 00:07:29.770 
I move back into your position where you

00:07:29.770 --> 00:07:31.920 
I move back into your position where you
are<00:07:29.950> should<00:07:30.850> be<00:07:30.940> pretty<00:07:31.060> easy<00:07:31.210> pick<00:07:31.810> up

00:07:31.920 --> 00:07:31.930 
are should be pretty easy pick up

00:07:31.930 --> 00:07:35.760 
are should be pretty easy pick up
everything<00:07:32.140> off<00:07:32.410> and<00:07:32.680> I<00:07:33.130> seen<00:07:33.340> the<00:07:33.460> level
