00:00:07.730 --> 00:00:11.910
 three 

00:00:08.880 --> 00:00:14.429
 with you on some or look bruised 

00:00:11.910 --> 00:00:17.460
 where your female wisdom is revealed 

00:00:14.429 --> 00:00:19.470
 for the benefit of your family if 

00:00:17.460 --> 00:00:20.510
 some farm company has developed 

00:00:19.470 --> 00:00:24.390
 such powder 

00:00:20.510 --> 00:00:28.109
 pour tea to her husband and suddenly he gets up and 

00:00:24.390 --> 00:00:31.260
 so early by computer or tv or 

00:00:28.109 --> 00:00:35.219
 iphone and starts chatting with wife 

00:00:31.260 --> 00:00:37.340
 children, then such a company would probably be 

00:00:35.219 --> 00:00:40.230
 multimillionaire in a matter of days 

00:00:37.340 --> 00:00:40.829
 unfortunately I do not have such a miracle 

00:00:40.230 --> 00:00:42.270
 recipe 

00:00:40.829 --> 00:00:44.390
 however i have a few 

00:00:42.270 --> 00:00:47.870
 recommendations that can help 

00:00:44.390 --> 00:00:50.280
 for starters let's stand in his sneakers 

00:00:47.870 --> 00:00:52.920
 most men experience strong 

00:00:50.280 --> 00:00:55.530
 stress and excess communication at work and 

00:00:52.920 --> 00:00:55.890
 when they come home they naturally 

00:00:55.530 --> 00:01:01.440
 although 

00:00:55.890 --> 00:01:03.809
 relieve stress and relax rotation we 

00:01:01.440 --> 00:01:05.369
 women when we want to relieve us 

00:01:03.809 --> 00:01:09.210
 need to share with a loved one 

00:01:05.369 --> 00:01:12.090
 talk and men on the contrary how 

00:01:09.210 --> 00:01:16.890
 usually want to retire and be alone 

00:01:12.090 --> 00:01:18.780
 and in this regard all these gadgets and very 

00:01:16.890 --> 00:01:21.509
 attractive you can sit quietly 

00:01:18.780 --> 00:01:26.820
 with them and create the illusion of activity 

00:01:21.509 --> 00:01:29.490
 while relaxing and therefore the first thing about 

00:01:26.820 --> 00:01:31.320
 what you should think is what 

00:01:29.490 --> 00:01:34.710
 the atmosphere meets your husband 

00:01:31.320 --> 00:01:37.320
 when he comes home promotes whether 

00:01:34.710 --> 00:01:40.020
 Does she help her relax 

00:01:37.320 --> 00:01:42.060
 relax i 'm sure that one of 

00:01:40.020 --> 00:01:44.220
 important functions same as families annoy 

00:01:42.060 --> 00:01:48.800
 at home so warm relaxing 

00:01:44.220 --> 00:01:51.350
 hell atmosphere remember how vysotsky 

00:01:48.800 --> 00:01:56.060
 I do so for someone to come home to repent 

00:01:51.350 --> 00:01:58.270
 there you are sitting and a few specific 

00:01:56.060 --> 00:02:02.210
 recommendations 

00:01:58.270 --> 00:02:05.030
 landing net you can honka and ask him what 

00:02:02.210 --> 00:02:08.710
 he reads or that he is wise why are you 

00:02:05.030 --> 00:02:13.880
 interested of course it will not lead to 

00:02:08.710 --> 00:02:16.640
 a sharp surge in homework 

00:02:13.880 --> 00:02:18.230
 deeds and your husband however it will lead 

00:02:16.640 --> 00:02:21.200
 to your iron dialogue 

00:02:18.230 --> 00:02:22.990
 instead of your sad monologue 

00:02:21.200 --> 00:02:26.570
 his back 

00:02:22.990 --> 00:02:30.410
 the following tell your husband something 

00:02:26.570 --> 00:02:32.420
 women themselves are usually very often in 

00:02:30.410 --> 00:02:34.760
 every woman say well, I 

00:02:32.420 --> 00:02:37.580
 I can say I have the same thing 

00:02:34.760 --> 00:02:39.490
 I shit about you baby 

00:02:37.580 --> 00:02:43.940
 tell 

00:02:39.490 --> 00:02:47.330
 we just catastrophically underestimate 

00:02:43.940 --> 00:02:52.610
 I would say we depreciate our inner 

00:02:47.330 --> 00:02:55.280
 the world and the content of our life refer 

00:02:52.610 --> 00:02:58.250
 with respect and interest in your 

00:02:55.280 --> 00:03:02.000
 own life internal and external and 

00:02:58.250 --> 00:03:05.540
 then you can easily interest her 

00:03:02.000 --> 00:03:07.570
 other and easy to find than exciting 

00:03:05.540 --> 00:03:10.730
 share 

00:03:07.570 --> 00:03:13.610
 the following is very important let your husband 

00:03:10.730 --> 00:03:17.180
 there will be some nice duties 

00:03:13.610 --> 00:03:19.580
 related to the children he performs 

00:03:17.180 --> 00:03:23.020
 objectively better than you that is in which 

00:03:19.580 --> 00:03:25.950
 he is irreplaceable for example in our family 

00:03:23.020 --> 00:03:27.190
 it's all about construction 

00:03:25.950 --> 00:03:30.810
 by drawing 

00:03:27.190 --> 00:03:35.950
 making masks and helmets of armor 

00:03:30.810 --> 00:03:37.840
 houses 9 weapons and so on and when dad 

00:03:35.950 --> 00:03:42.330
 comes to my children asks him for help and 

00:03:37.840 --> 00:03:47.280
 and because with me this is of little use 

00:03:42.330 --> 00:03:52.990
 the following talk and we can openly and 

00:03:47.280 --> 00:03:55.660
 calmly tell him i understand and respect 

00:03:52.990 --> 00:04:00.820
 your desire to be alone with 

00:03:55.660 --> 00:04:04.630
 computer but there is still my desire and 

00:04:00.820 --> 00:04:06.520
 children's desire to talk with you like us 

00:04:04.630 --> 00:04:09.480

00:04:09.480 --> 00:04:15.970
 together respectfully wish each other 

00:04:13.690 --> 00:04:21.160
 develop a friend that's acceptable 

00:04:15.970 --> 00:04:22.860
 mode following initiate joint 

00:04:21.160 --> 00:04:26.020

00:04:26.020 --> 00:04:30.160

00:04:27.730 --> 00:04:31.300
 any different or get settled on 

00:04:30.160 --> 00:04:34.330

 sculpting dumplings and the whole family like this 

00:04:34.330 --> 00:04:41.620

00:04:41.620 --> 00:04:49.240
