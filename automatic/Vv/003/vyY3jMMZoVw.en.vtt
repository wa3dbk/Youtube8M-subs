it's more positive but we've always sort
of<00:00:42.360> come<00:00:42.510> from<00:00:42.690> a<00:00:42.860> darker<00:00:43.860> place<00:00:44.010> we've<00:00:44.340> always

00:00:44.479 --> 00:00:44.489 
of come from a darker place we've always

00:00:44.489 --> 00:00:46.580 
of come from a darker place we've always
written<00:00:44.879> about<00:00:45.030> the<00:00:45.210> things<00:00:45.449> that<00:00:45.750> we've<00:00:46.410> been

00:00:46.580 --> 00:00:46.590 
written about the things that we've been

00:00:46.590 --> 00:00:48.650 
written about the things that we've been
through<00:00:46.649> like<00:00:47.129> our<00:00:47.280> personal<00:00:47.670> struggles<00:00:48.480> and

00:00:48.650 --> 00:00:48.660 
through like our personal struggles and

00:00:48.660 --> 00:00:49.050 
through like our personal struggles and
that's

00:00:49.050 --> 00:00:49.060 
that's

00:00:49.060 --> 00:00:51.060 
that's
like<00:00:49.210> so<00:00:49.420> this<00:00:50.110> record<00:00:50.440> is<00:00:50.530> coming<00:00:50.830> from<00:00:50.950> the

00:00:51.060 --> 00:00:51.070 
like so this record is coming from the

00:00:51.070 --> 00:00:52.860 
like so this record is coming from the
same<00:00:51.220> spot<00:00:51.430> but<00:00:51.880> it's<00:00:52.000> I<00:00:52.210> think<00:00:52.390> it's<00:00:52.510> just<00:00:52.660> the

00:00:52.860 --> 00:00:52.870 
same spot but it's I think it's just the

00:00:52.870 --> 00:00:56.190 
same spot but it's I think it's just the
way<00:00:53.470> that<00:00:53.650> we<00:00:53.730> way<00:00:54.730> that<00:00:54.910> we<00:00:55.360> see<00:00:56.080> ourselves

00:00:56.190 --> 00:00:56.200 
way that we way that we see ourselves

00:00:56.200 --> 00:00:57.780 
way that we way that we see ourselves
now<00:00:56.650> you<00:00:56.800> know<00:00:56.980> we<00:00:57.100> look<00:00:57.280> at<00:00:57.400> life<00:00:57.580> in<00:00:57.730> a

00:00:57.780 --> 00:00:57.790 
now you know we look at life in a

00:00:57.790 --> 00:00:59.880 
now you know we look at life in a
different<00:00:57.820> way<00:00:58.120> and<00:00:58.360> we're<00:00:58.510> trying<00:00:58.750> to<00:00:58.960> we're

00:00:59.880 --> 00:00:59.890 
different way and we're trying to we're

00:00:59.890 --> 00:01:01.950 
different way and we're trying to we're
trying<00:01:00.010> to<00:01:00.190> basically<00:01:00.450> play<00:01:01.450> the<00:01:01.630> hand<00:01:01.780> and

00:01:01.950 --> 00:01:01.960 
trying to basically play the hand and

00:01:01.960 --> 00:01:03.870 
trying to basically play the hand and
we're<00:01:02.050> down<00:01:02.230> in<00:01:02.440> automated<00:01:03.010> and<00:01:03.280> losers<00:01:03.700> now

00:01:03.870 --> 00:01:03.880 
we're down in automated and losers now

00:01:03.880 --> 00:01:22.620 
we're down in automated and losers now
so

00:01:22.620 --> 00:01:22.630 

00:01:22.630 --> 00:01:37.330 

this<00:01:23.630> guy<00:01:23.840> age

00:01:37.330 --> 00:01:37.340 

00:01:37.340 --> 00:01:41.870 

as<00:01:37.820> reality

00:01:41.870 --> 00:01:41.880 

00:01:41.880 --> 00:01:44.080 

really<00:01:42.720> smash

00:01:44.080 --> 00:01:44.090 
really smash

00:01:44.090 --> 00:01:46.870 
really smash
so<00:01:44.659> that<00:01:44.869> tells<00:01:45.110> a<00:01:45.320> bit<00:01:45.799> about<00:01:46.100> the<00:01:46.369> subjects

00:01:46.870 --> 00:01:46.880 
so that tells a bit about the subjects

00:01:46.880 --> 00:01:48.609 
so that tells a bit about the subjects
of<00:01:46.970> most<00:01:47.360> of<00:01:47.509> the<00:01:47.630> songs<00:01:47.869> about<00:01:48.110> the<00:01:48.259> album

00:01:48.609 --> 00:01:48.619 
of most of the songs about the album

00:01:48.619 --> 00:01:51.039 
of most of the songs about the album
does<00:01:49.490> that<00:01:49.640> reflect<00:01:49.909> definitely<00:01:50.840> have<00:01:50.930> to

00:01:51.039 --> 00:01:51.049 
does that reflect definitely have to

00:01:51.049 --> 00:02:03.719 
does that reflect definitely have to
cover<00:01:51.229> the<00:01:51.560> cover

00:02:03.719 --> 00:02:03.729 

00:02:03.729 --> 00:02:06.580 

well<00:02:04.729> I<00:02:04.759> think<00:02:04.939> we're<00:02:05.240> we're<00:02:06.079> actually<00:02:06.229> trying

00:02:06.580 --> 00:02:06.590 
well I think we're we're actually trying

00:02:06.590 --> 00:02:08.559 
well I think we're we're actually trying
to<00:02:06.770> figure<00:02:07.009> that<00:02:07.130> I<00:02:07.189> read<00:02:07.429> I<00:02:07.640> mean<00:02:07.820> there's<00:02:08.209> two

00:02:08.559 --> 00:02:08.569 
to figure that I read I mean there's two

00:02:08.569 --> 00:02:10.990 
to figure that I read I mean there's two
songs<00:02:08.840> on<00:02:09.019> the<00:02:09.140> record<00:02:09.229> that<00:02:09.670> that<00:02:10.670> we'd<00:02:10.819> like

00:02:10.990 --> 00:02:11.000 
songs on the record that that we'd like

00:02:11.000 --> 00:02:13.750 
songs on the record that that we'd like
to<00:02:11.180> be<00:02:11.330> you<00:02:11.870> know<00:02:12.019> the<00:02:12.530> second<00:02:12.920> signal<00:02:13.069> at<00:02:13.430> one

00:02:13.750 --> 00:02:13.760 
to be you know the second signal at one

00:02:13.760 --> 00:02:16.449 
to be you know the second signal at one
who's<00:02:14.000> both<00:02:14.239> world<00:02:14.540> so<00:02:14.720> cold<00:02:14.989> and<00:02:15.950> the<00:02:16.190> second

00:02:16.449 --> 00:02:16.459 
who's both world so cold and the second

00:02:16.459 --> 00:02:18.490 
who's both world so cold and the second
one's<00:02:16.610> good<00:02:16.819> life<00:02:17.000> but<00:02:17.269> I<00:02:17.330> think<00:02:17.629> I<00:02:18.140> think

00:02:18.490 --> 00:02:18.500 
one's good life but I think I think

00:02:18.500 --> 00:02:20.110 
one's good life but I think I think
world<00:02:18.830> so<00:02:19.040> fun<00:02:19.280> probably<00:02:19.700> about<00:02:19.970> the

00:02:20.110 --> 00:02:20.120 
world so fun probably about the

00:02:20.120 --> 00:02:24.789 
world so fun probably about the
underside<00:02:20.540> of<00:02:20.569> smoof<00:02:20.930> and<00:02:21.310> why<00:02:22.840> I<00:02:23.840> think<00:02:24.560> it's

00:02:24.789 --> 00:02:24.799 
underside of smoof and why I think it's

00:02:24.799 --> 00:02:27.970 
underside of smoof and why I think it's
one<00:02:24.950> of<00:02:25.040> the<00:02:25.129> I<00:02:25.160> mean<00:02:25.519> for<00:02:25.819> for<00:02:26.269> us<00:02:26.360> I<00:02:26.540> think<00:02:26.980> for

00:02:27.970 --> 00:02:27.980 
one of the I mean for for us I think for

00:02:27.980 --> 00:02:30.039 
one of the I mean for for us I think for
long<00:02:28.250> lines<00:02:28.519> what<00:02:28.940> we've<00:02:29.150> sort<00:02:29.840> of<00:02:29.870> what<00:02:30.019> our

00:02:30.039 --> 00:02:30.049
