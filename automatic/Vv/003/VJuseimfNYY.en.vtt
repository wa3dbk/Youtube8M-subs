00:02:26.280 --> 00:02:26.290 
though it's not technically a

00:02:26.290 --> 00:02:27.990 
though it's not technically a

00:02:27.990 --> 00:02:28.000 
partnership it's still partnership and

00:02:28.000 --> 00:02:30.720 
partnership it's still partnership and
they<00:02:28.060> consider<00:02:28.450> it<00:02:28.570> one<00:02:28.720> so<00:02:29.380> they<00:02:30.340> have<00:02:30.550> to

00:02:30.720 --> 00:02:30.730 
they consider it one so they have to

00:02:30.730 --> 00:02:32.970 
they consider it one so they have to
release<00:02:31.060> you<00:02:31.300> like<00:02:32.050> you<00:02:32.380> would<00:02:32.500> have<00:02:32.650> to<00:02:32.830> get

00:02:35.550 --> 00:02:35.560 
released from a network like machinima

00:02:35.560 --> 00:02:37.530 
released from a network like machinima
or<00:02:35.770> TGN<00:02:36.130> to<00:02:36.490> transfer<00:02:37.000> your<00:02:37.090> partnership

00:02:37.530 --> 00:02:37.540 
or TGN to transfer your partnership

00:02:37.540 --> 00:02:40.470 
or TGN to transfer your partnership
somewhere<00:02:37.900> else<00:02:38.080> and<00:02:38.820> apparently<00:02:39.820> they're

00:02:40.470 --> 00:02:40.480 
somewhere else and apparently they're

00:02:40.480 --> 00:02:43.890 
somewhere else and apparently they're
just<00:02:40.690> having<00:02:40.960> a<00:02:41.910> hard<00:02:42.910> time<00:02:43.210> doing<00:02:43.570> that<00:02:43.690> right

00:02:43.890 --> 00:02:43.900 
just having a hard time doing that right

00:02:43.900 --> 00:02:45.510 
just having a hard time doing that right
now<00:02:43.960> I'm<00:02:44.320> assuming<00:02:44.830> it's<00:02:44.920> because<00:02:45.310> they're

00:02:45.510 --> 00:02:45.520 
now I'm assuming it's because they're

00:02:45.520 --> 00:02:46.860 
now I'm assuming it's because they're
just<00:02:45.670> really<00:02:45.850> backed<00:02:46.150> up<00:02:46.420> with<00:02:46.630> everyone

just really backed up with everyone

00:02:46.870 --> 00:02:48.930 
just really backed up with everyone
because<00:02:47.560> I'm<00:02:47.800> assuming<00:02:48.280> that<00:02:48.520> there's<00:02:48.730> like

00:02:48.930 --> 00:02:48.940 
because I'm assuming that there's like

00:02:48.940 --> 00:02:50.699 
because I'm assuming that there's like
thousands<00:02:49.660> upon<00:02:49.870> thousands<00:02:50.350> of<00:02:50.470> people

00:02:50.699 --> 00:02:50.709 
thousands upon thousands of people

00:02:50.709 --> 00:02:51.810

talking about disabling Adsense and that

00:05:46.310 --> 00:05:47.880 
talking about disabling Adsense and that
is<00:05:46.460> actually<00:05:46.790> something<00:05:47.000> that<00:05:47.120> I<00:05:47.240> did<00:05:47.510> and

00:05:47.880 --> 00:05:47.890 
is actually something that I did and

00:05:47.890 --> 00:05:50.980 
is actually something that I did and
what<00:05:48.890> I've<00:05:49.010> read<00:05:49.310> I've<00:05:49.910> done<00:05:50.300> research<00:05:50.750> on

00:05:50.980 --> 00:05:50.990 
what I've read I've done research on

00:05:50.990 --> 00:05:52.450 
what I've read I've done research on
this<00:05:51.140> because<00:05:51.260> it's<00:05:51.530> frustrating<00:05:51.890> me<00:05:52.100> so<00:05:52.280> much

00:05:52.450 --> 00:05:52.460 
this because it's frustrating me so much

00:05:52.460 --> 00:05:54.940 
this because it's frustrating me so much
and<00:05:52.700> what<00:05:53.540> i've<00:05:53.660> read<00:05:53.840> is<00:05:53.900> when<00:05:54.470> you<00:05:54.620> disable

00:05:54.940 --> 00:05:54.950 
and what i've read is when you disable

00:05:54.950 --> 00:05:56.860 
and what i've read is when you disable
the<00:05:55.160> adsense<00:05:55.940> on<00:05:56.090> your<00:05:56.270> account<00:05:56.480> it's

00:05:56.860 --> 00:05:56.870 
the adsense on your account it's

00:05:56.870 --> 00:05:59.490 
the adsense on your account it's
essentially<00:05:57.710> locking<00:05:58.160> you<00:05:58.280> into<00:05:58.520> adsense<00:05:59.210> and

00:05:59.490 --> 00:05:59.500 
essentially locking you into adsense and

00:05:59.500 --> 00:06:02.790 
essentially locking you into adsense and
your<00:06:00.500> channel<00:06:01.010> cannot<00:06:01.370> be<00:06:01.490> taken<00:06:01.670> out<00:06:01.910> so

00:06:02.790 --> 00:06:02.800 
your channel cannot be taken out so

00:06:02.800 --> 00:06:05.560 
your channel cannot be taken out so
definitely<00:06:03.800> if<00:06:04.310> you<00:06:04.430> have<00:06:04.580> adsense<00:06:05.060> do<00:06:05.420> not
