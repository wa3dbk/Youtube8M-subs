the<00:01:01.800> video<00:01:02.070> just<00:01:02.609> a<00:01:02.789> couple<00:01:03.030> of<00:01:03.210> shots<00:01:03.510> just

00:01:03.950 --> 00:01:03.960 
the video just a couple of shots just

00:01:03.960 --> 00:01:05.810 
the video just a couple of shots just
above<00:01:04.260> the<00:01:04.320> tire<00:01:04.680> and<00:01:04.979> there<00:01:05.189> you<00:01:05.339> can<00:01:05.369> see<00:01:05.549> the

00:01:05.810 --> 00:01:05.820 
above the tire and there you can see the

00:01:05.820 --> 00:01:08.600 
above the tire and there you can see the
petrol<00:01:06.240> starting<00:01:06.750> to<00:01:06.900> leak<00:01:07.220> from<00:01:08.220> underneath

00:01:08.600 --> 00:01:08.610 
petrol starting to leak from underneath

00:01:08.610 --> 00:01:11.179 
petrol starting to leak from underneath
so<00:01:09.030> it<00:01:09.060> is<00:01:09.299> pretty<00:01:09.570> awesome<00:01:09.840> I<00:01:10.380> know<00:01:10.710> a<00:01:10.890> lot<00:01:11.159> of

00:01:11.179 --> 00:01:11.189 
so it is pretty awesome I know a lot of

00:01:11.189 --> 00:01:13.039 
so it is pretty awesome I know a lot of
people<00:01:11.310> have<00:01:11.729> been<00:01:11.760> suggesting<00:01:12.600> like<00:01:12.900> a

00:01:13.039 --> 00:01:13.049 
people have been suggesting like a

00:01:13.049 --> 00:01:15.890 
people have been suggesting like a
real-life<00:01:13.710> petrol<00:01:14.670> Phillip<00:01:15.000> for<00:01:15.210> the<00:01:15.299> car<00:01:15.540> and

00:01:15.890 --> 00:01:15.900 
real-life petrol Phillip for the car and

00:01:15.900 --> 00:01:17.390 
real-life petrol Phillip for the car and
I<00:01:16.080> guess<00:01:16.259> this<00:01:16.470> is<00:01:16.619> kind<00:01:16.770> of<00:01:16.950> like<00:01:17.130> close

00:01:17.390 --> 00:01:17.400 
I guess this is kind of like close

00:01:17.400 --> 00:01:19.190 
I guess this is kind of like close
enough<00:01:17.759> if<00:01:17.939> you<00:01:18.090> ask<00:01:18.119> me<00:01:18.509> because<00:01:18.720> in<00:01:19.049> this

00:01:19.190 --> 00:01:19.200 
enough if you ask me because in this

00:01:19.200 --> 00:01:21.109 
enough if you ask me because in this
obviously<00:01:19.979> know<00:01:20.220> the<00:01:20.369> characters<00:01:20.820> contain

00:01:21.109 --> 00:01:21.119 
obviously know the characters contain

00:01:21.119 --> 00:01:22.760 
obviously know the characters contain
petrol<00:01:21.600> and<00:01:21.780> not<00:01:21.960> a<00:01:21.990> lot<00:01:22.200> of<00:01:22.259> people<00:01:22.409> know

00:01:22.760 --> 00:01:22.770 
petrol and not a lot of people know

00:01:22.770 --> 00:01:25.310 
petrol and not a lot of people know
about<00:01:23.040> it<00:01:23.220> so<00:01:23.939> I<00:01:24.180> guess<00:01:24.330> this<00:01:24.630> is<00:01:24.869> just<00:01:24.900> pretty

00:01:36.410 --> 00:01:36.420 
Easter Egg in GTA 5 I mean I wouldn't

00:01:36.420 --> 00:01:38.300 
Easter Egg in GTA 5 I mean I wouldn't
have<00:01:36.509> thought<00:01:36.659> about<00:01:36.869> this<00:01:37.020> and<00:01:37.439> i'm<00:01:37.890> sure<00:01:38.100> you

00:01:38.300 --> 00:01:38.310 
have thought about this and i'm sure you

00:01:38.310 --> 00:01:40.219 
have thought about this and i'm sure you
guys<00:01:38.340> probably<00:01:38.850> thought<00:01:39.299> the<00:01:39.509> same<00:01:39.689> thing<00:01:39.720> I

00:01:40.219 --> 00:01:40.229 
guys probably thought the same thing I

00:01:40.229 --> 00:01:42.679 
guys probably thought the same thing I
mean<00:01:40.740> people<00:01:41.189> just<00:01:41.430> assumed<00:01:42.150> cars<00:01:42.420> were

00:01:42.679 --> 00:01:42.689 
mean people just assumed cars were

00:01:42.689 --> 00:01:44.600 
mean people just assumed cars were
normal<00:01:43.229> vehicles<00:01:43.680> and<00:01:43.920> they<00:01:44.070> didn't<00:01:44.369> contain

00:01:44.600 --> 00:01:44.610 
normal vehicles and they didn't contain

00:01:44.610 --> 00:01:46.550 
normal vehicles and they didn't contain
petrol<00:01:45.090> book<00:01:45.299> I<00:01:45.509> guess<00:01:45.899> it's<00:01:46.079> an<00:01:46.200> easter<00:01:46.439> egg

00:01:46.550 --> 00:01:46.560 
petrol book I guess it's an easter egg

00:01:46.560 --> 00:01:49.460 
petrol book I guess it's an easter egg
and<00:01:46.829> it's<00:01:47.490> pretty<00:01:47.670> pretty<00:01:48.240> cool<00:01:48.479> to<00:01:48.750> see<00:01:49.110> some

00:01:49.460 --> 00:01:49.470 
and it's pretty pretty cool to see some

00:01:49.470 --> 00:01:51.560 
and it's pretty pretty cool to see some
cars<00:01:49.680> containing<00:01:50.009> petrol<00:01:50.520> so<00:01:51.090> with<00:01:51.270> that<00:01:51.360> said
