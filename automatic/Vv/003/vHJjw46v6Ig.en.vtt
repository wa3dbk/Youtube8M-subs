00:00:45.619 --> 00:00:45.629 
like right there you're going to see how

00:00:45.629 --> 00:00:48.680 
like right there you're going to see how
it's<00:00:46.140> easy<00:00:46.770> you're<00:00:47.579> about<00:00:47.789> to<00:00:48.000> see<00:00:48.210> just<00:00:48.480> how

00:00:48.680 --> 00:00:48.690 
it's easy you're about to see just how

00:00:48.690 --> 00:00:50.270 
it's easy you're about to see just how
are<00:00:48.960> you<00:00:49.050> guessing<00:00:49.230> the<00:00:49.469> input<00:00:49.800> in<00:00:49.950> a<00:00:50.039> fast

00:00:50.270 --> 00:00:50.280 
are you guessing the input in a fast

00:00:50.280 --> 00:00:53.209 
are you guessing the input in a fast
motion<00:00:50.520> man<00:00:51.530> such<00:00:52.530> as<00:00:52.680> the<00:00:52.770> throwing<00:00:53.100> light

00:00:53.209 --> 00:00:53.219 
motion man such as the throwing light

00:00:53.219 --> 00:00:55.549 
motion man such as the throwing light
doesn't<00:00:53.640> get<00:00:53.789> it<00:00:53.940> and<00:00:54.230> here's<00:00:55.230> where<00:00:55.440> the

00:00:55.549 --> 00:00:55.559 
doesn't get it and here's where the

00:00:55.559 --> 00:00:58.330 
doesn't get it and here's where the
trick<00:00:55.739> really<00:00:56.100> helps<00:00:56.370> out<00:00:56.809> yeah<00:00:57.809> right<00:00:58.020> there

00:00:58.330 --> 00:00:58.340 
trick really helps out yeah right there

00:00:58.340 --> 00:01:01.819 
trick really helps out yeah right there
it<00:00:59.340> uh<00:00:59.840> actually<00:01:00.840> works<00:01:01.230> when<00:01:01.469> you're<00:01:01.620> in<00:01:01.710> the

00:01:01.819 --> 00:01:01.829 
it uh actually works when you're in the

00:01:01.829 --> 00:01:04.460 
it uh actually works when you're in the
age<00:01:02.039> walking<00:01:03.030> I<00:01:03.270> mean<00:01:03.840> obviously<00:01:03.960> it's<00:01:04.290> better

00:01:04.460 --> 00:01:04.470 
age walking I mean obviously it's better

00:01:04.470 --> 00:01:06.490 
age walking I mean obviously it's better
than<00:01:04.619> stationary<00:01:05.250> because<00:01:05.610> they're<00:01:05.790> being

00:01:06.490 --> 00:01:06.500
