 players

 ambassador of civilization

 and all the other Onkilons my ambassador will 

00:00:59.879 --> 00:01:05.220
 must be conveyed to the aborigines 

00:01:02.100 --> 00:01:08.460
 information about the achievements of civilization and 

00:01:05.220 --> 00:01:12.000
 so that not everyone understood it, but at least 

00:01:08.460 --> 00:01:15.150
 one for this the ambassador puts in 

00:01:12.000 --> 00:01:18.360
 the center of the table are three cards of achievement one 

00:01:15.150 --> 00:01:20.460
 over another and makes one of the words or 

00:01:18.360 --> 00:01:21.860
 phrases which he will try 

00:01:20.460 --> 00:01:24.740
 to explain 

00:01:21.860 --> 00:01:28.040
 The word is indicated by a token. 

00:01:24.740 --> 00:01:31.259
 corresponding numbers from one to six 

00:01:28.040 --> 00:01:34.020
 then the ambassador tries to explain the Onkilons 

00:01:31.259 --> 00:01:36.150
 the essence of the ordered achievement using 

00:01:34.020 --> 00:01:38.130
 for this is in his arms 

00:01:36.150 --> 00:01:41.610
 two or three cards 

00:01:38.130 --> 00:01:44.610
 characters for example the train he decides 

00:01:41.610 --> 00:01:48.210
 explained by road maps sledges 

00:01:44.610 --> 00:01:50.670
 loud now the Onkilons try to guess 

00:01:48.210 --> 00:01:52.159
 which of the six words tried 

00:01:50.670 --> 00:01:55.619
 portray ambassador 

00:01:52.159 --> 00:01:58.530
 as soon as a player is determined he does 

00:01:55.619 --> 00:02:01.259
 by the same tone of vote that 

00:01:58.530 --> 00:02:03.659
 demonstrate the power of the bid angel he 

00:02:01.259 --> 00:02:06.979
 lays out with a voting badge 

00:02:03.659 --> 00:02:10.530
 resource token it denotes force 

00:02:06.979 --> 00:02:11.060
 Onkilon confidence the right fish 

00:02:10.530 --> 00:02:15.770
 one 

00:02:11.060 --> 00:02:16.880
 skin 293 as soon as all the Onkilons 

00:02:15.770 --> 00:02:19.190
 made a bet 

00:02:16.880 --> 00:02:22.700
 their tokens along with ambassador tokens 

00:02:19.190 --> 00:02:25.580
 simultaneously opened if not one 

00:02:22.700 --> 00:02:28.190
 or all at once understood the ambassador then the ambassador 

00:02:25.580 --> 00:02:29.810
 the angel leaves with nothing and he gets by 

00:02:28.190 --> 00:02:33.769
 one victory point 

00:02:29.810 --> 00:02:36.440
 and if the ambassador did not understand everything that guessed 

00:02:33.769 --> 00:02:37.430
 gets so much points what was the strength 

00:02:36.440 --> 00:02:40.540
 their inserts 

00:02:37.430 --> 00:02:42.950
 and the ambassador for the maximum strength of the bet 

00:02:40.540 --> 00:02:45.410
 then same languid vote rates 

00:02:42.950 --> 00:02:48.590
 returned to the players for the only 

00:02:45.410 --> 00:02:50.780
 except if the angel he used 

00:02:48.590 --> 00:02:53.030
 one or three then this token 

00:02:50.780 --> 00:02:55.549
 set aside and cannot be 

00:02:53.030 --> 00:02:58.989
 used until the player uses them 

00:02:55.549 --> 00:03:01.849
 both then they are returned to the player 

00:02:58.989 --> 00:03:03.709
 deuce aside is not delayed and 

00:03:01.849 --> 00:03:07.489
 can be used by the player 

00:03:03.709 --> 00:03:09.560
 permanently at the end of the round, Ambassador 

00:03:07.489 --> 00:03:12.500
 sends everything from playing cards to 

00:03:09.560 --> 00:03:15.650
 reset and can reset in addition one more 

00:03:12.500 --> 00:03:18.950
 character from hand after that he again 

00:03:15.650 --> 00:03:21.680
 gets character is 6 and achievements to 

00:03:18.950 --> 00:03:24.920
 three in the new round becomes ambassador 

00:03:21.680 --> 00:03:27.380
 sitting to the left of the previous player and so 

00:03:24.920 --> 00:03:28.730
 continues until the end of the agreed 

00:03:27.380 --> 00:03:31.730
 number of laps 

00:03:28.730 --> 00:03:34.579
 and the winner is the one who scored to 

00:03:31.730 --> 00:03:37.940
 ending the maximum number of victories 

00:03:34.579 --> 00:03:40.280
 I understand your points is a real 

00:03:37.940 --> 00:03:42.019
 textbook understanding format 

00:03:40.280 --> 00:03:44.299

00:03:42.019 --> 00:03:45.230

00:03:45.230 --> 00:03:52.389
 trying to explain to the characters what is 

00:03:47.989 --> 00:03:52.389
 democracy or toothpaste
