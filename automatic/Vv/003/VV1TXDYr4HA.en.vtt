00:02:05.880 --> 00:02:11.059 
version of computer you have went off at
64-bit<00:02:06.509> or<00:02:06.540> 32-bit<00:02:07.069> just<00:02:08.069> remember<00:02:10.069> that

00:02:11.059 --> 00:02:11.069 
64-bit or 32-bit just remember that

00:02:11.069 --> 00:02:12.550 
64-bit or 32-bit just remember that
seems<00:02:11.310> like<00:02:11.489> I<00:02:11.550> don't<00:02:11.580> even<00:02:11.850> have<00:02:11.970> it<00:02:12.180> in<00:02:12.239> here

00:02:12.550 --> 00:02:12.560 
seems like I don't even have it in here

00:02:12.560 --> 00:02:17.270 
seems like I don't even have it in here
so<00:02:14.150> so<00:02:15.150> then<00:02:15.390> if<00:02:15.600> you<00:02:15.750> have<00:02:15.930> a<00:02:15.959> 32-bit<00:02:16.590> put<00:02:17.190> it

00:02:17.270 --> 00:02:17.280 
so so then if you have a 32-bit put it

00:02:17.280 --> 00:02:21.880 
so so then if you have a 32-bit put it
in<00:02:17.400> system<00:02:17.940> 32<00:02:18.660> and<00:02:19.230> just<00:02:20.010> drag<00:02:20.250> it<00:02:20.370> in<00:02:20.430> there

00:02:21.880 --> 00:02:21.890 
in system 32 and just drag it in there

00:02:21.890 --> 00:02:28.070 
in system 32 and just drag it in there
and<00:02:22.890> then<00:02:23.010> there<00:02:23.130> you<00:02:23.160> go<00:02:26.420> but<00:02:27.420> I<00:02:27.540> can't<00:02:27.930> have

00:02:28.070 --> 00:02:28.080 
and then there you go but I can't have

00:02:28.080 --> 00:02:29.600 
and then there you go but I can't have
that<00:02:28.110> in<00:02:28.290> there<00:02:28.560> so<00:02:28.800> I<00:02:28.830> have<00:02:29.010> to<00:02:29.100> take<00:02:29.280> that<00:02:29.400> out

00:02:29.600 --> 00:02:29.610

00:02:29.610 --> 00:02:32.330 
that in there so I have to take that out
you<00:02:30.540> might<00:02:31.050> have<00:02:31.260> to<00:02:31.380> take<00:02:31.560> ownership<00:02:31.769> of<00:02:32.160> it

00:02:32.330 --> 00:02:32.340
