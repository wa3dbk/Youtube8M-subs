00:00:15.660 --> 00:00:20.140
 the quantity and frequency 

00:00:17.949 --> 00:00:22.480
 of irrigation constitute a 

00:00:20.140 --> 00:00:24.579
 fundamental question for the cure 

00:00:22.480 --> 00:00:26.890
 of a garden that becomes so much more 

00:00:24.579 --> 00:00:29.140
 important in the case of 

00:00:26.890 --> 00:00:31.480
 irrigation because based on this 

00:00:29.140 --> 00:00:34.349
 consideration it will regulate the 

00:00:31.480 --> 00:00:34.349
 operation 

00:00:35.310 --> 00:00:40.800
 usually the capacity of the sprinklers 

00:00:37.460 --> 00:00:43.080
 varies depending on the urgency used but 

00:00:40.800 --> 00:00:45.990
 what matters most in this case is the 

00:00:43.080 --> 00:00:48.270
 range and area covered by scratches 

00:00:45.990 --> 00:00:50.220
 same verifying that it has a 

00:00:48.270 --> 00:00:53.430
 homogeneity in the coverage of the 

00:00:50.220 --> 00:00:55.920
 surface you can check this 

00:00:53.430 --> 00:00:58.200
 homogeneity by placing a series of measure 

00:00:55.920 --> 00:01:02.220
 graduated on the area covered by the 

00:00:58.200 --> 00:01:03.930
 sprinkler the best coverage of 

00:01:02.220 --> 00:01:06.780
 an area is obtained with a correct one 

00:01:03.930 --> 00:01:09.869
 arrangement of square sprinklers 

00:01:06.780 --> 00:01:11.250
 or triangle maybe even telling the 

00:01:09.869 --> 00:01:13.650
 range 

00:01:11.250 --> 00:01:15.540
 there is indeed a great difference if the 

00:01:13.650 --> 00:01:18.300
 same water flow works on one 

00:01:15.540 --> 00:01:20.750
 range of 10 meters or just seven e 

00:01:18.300 --> 00:01:20.750
 half 

00:01:22.650 --> 00:01:27.720
 however reducing the range by 25 per 

00:01:25.410 --> 00:01:30.150
 hundred is not a corresponding increase 

00:01:27.720 --> 00:01:32.520
 of wetting since the area of ​​the 

00:01:30.150 --> 00:01:34.830
 irrigated area does not vary in 

00:01:32.520 --> 00:01:38.120
 linear proportion but according to 

00:01:34.830 --> 00:01:38.120
 proportions of the circle 

00:01:38.380 --> 00:01:42.880
 in any case a correct disposition 

00:01:40.680 --> 00:01:45.100
 also includes areas of 

00:01:42.880 --> 00:01:47.170
 overlapping jets since 

00:01:45.100 --> 00:01:49.840
 otherwise the range of action of 

00:01:47.170 --> 00:01:52.470
 single sprinkler would leave traits 

00:01:49.840 --> 00:01:52.470
 discovered
