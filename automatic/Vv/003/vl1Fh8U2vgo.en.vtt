00:02:01.460 --> 00:02:03.190 
around her those are the best parts of
the<00:02:01.580> movie<00:02:01.759> and<00:02:02.030> this<00:02:02.630> character<00:02:02.990> is<00:02:03.049> not

00:02:03.190 --> 00:02:03.200 
the movie and this character is not

00:02:03.200 --> 00:02:04.090 
the movie and this character is not

Pixar and when fixer 84 is actually a

00:07:19.140 --> 00:07:21.500 
Pixar and when fixer 84 is actually a
really<00:07:19.440> low<00:07:19.740> score<00:07:20.190> even<00:07:20.790> though<00:07:21.060> this<00:07:21.270> is
