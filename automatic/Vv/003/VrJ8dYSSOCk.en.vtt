00:00:12.330 --> 00:00:12.340 
fixin vans oh well we didn't expect honk

00:00:12.340 --> 00:00:15.000 
fixin vans oh well we didn't expect honk
at<00:00:12.460> all<00:00:12.810> we<00:00:13.810> were<00:00:13.900> really<00:00:14.080> surprised<00:00:14.590> by<00:00:14.800> that

00:00:15.000 --> 00:00:15.010 
at all we were really surprised by that

00:00:15.010 --> 00:00:18.270 
at all we were really surprised by that
I'm<00:00:15.340> what's<00:00:16.330> more<00:00:16.600> he<00:00:16.930> should<00:00:17.230> lose<00:00:17.500> lane<00:00:17.860> to

00:00:18.270 --> 00:00:18.280 
I'm what's more he should lose lane to

00:00:18.280 --> 00:00:21.000 
I'm what's more he should lose lane to
trundle<00:00:18.700> but<00:00:19.660> I<00:00:20.050> think<00:00:20.320> it<00:00:20.590> came<00:00:20.800> out<00:00:20.860> that

00:00:21.000 --> 00:00:21.010 
trundle but I think it came out that

00:00:21.010 --> 00:00:24.150 
trundle but I think it came out that
they<00:00:21.340> just<00:00:21.580> wanted<00:00:21.940> to<00:00:22.000> swap<00:00:22.420> and<00:00:22.870> they<00:00:23.160> really

00:00:24.150 --> 00:00:24.160 
they just wanted to swap and they really

00:00:24.160 --> 00:00:27.270 
they just wanted to swap and they really
gave<00:00:24.340> them<00:00:24.640> advantage<00:00:25.180> early<00:00:25.390> on<00:00:25.810> so<00:00:26.470> how<00:00:27.220> did

00:00:27.270 --> 00:00:27.280 
gave them advantage early on so how did

00:00:27.280 --> 00:00:29.250 
gave them advantage early on so how did
the<00:00:27.460> matchup<00:00:27.820> you<00:00:27.940> know<00:00:28.030> eventually<00:00:28.330> play<00:00:29.080> out

00:00:29.250 --> 00:00:29.260 
the matchup you know eventually play out

00:00:29.260 --> 00:00:30.630 
the matchup you know eventually play out
you<00:00:29.470> said<00:00:29.800> you<00:00:29.920> weren't<00:00:30.039> expecting<00:00:30.220> the

00:00:30.630 --> 00:00:30.640 
you said you weren't expecting the

00:00:33.360 --> 00:00:33.370 
him in the top lane do you think was a

00:00:33.370 --> 00:00:37.590 
him in the top lane do you think was a
small<00:00:33.940> pic<00:00:34.120> in<00:00:34.210> the<00:00:34.239> car<00:00:34.449> meta<00:00:34.980> no<00:00:35.980> he<00:00:36.730> was<00:00:36.940> he

00:00:37.590 --> 00:00:37.600 
small pic in the car meta no he was he

00:00:37.600 --> 00:00:39.329 
small pic in the car meta no he was he
had<00:00:37.749> advantage<00:00:38.260> but<00:00:38.440> he<00:00:38.679> didn't<00:00:39.219> do<00:00:39.309> anything

00:00:39.329 --> 00:00:39.339 
had advantage but he didn't do anything

00:00:39.339 --> 00:00:43.680 
had advantage but he didn't do anything
with<00:00:39.909> that<00:00:39.940> and<00:00:41.010> although<00:00:42.010> I<00:00:42.039> was<00:00:42.429> like<00:00:42.699> 40

00:00:43.680 --> 00:00:43.690 
with that and although I was like 40

00:00:43.690 --> 00:00:46.079 
with that and although I was like 40
creeps<00:00:43.929> behind<00:00:44.350> I<00:00:44.530> just<00:00:44.949> one<00:00:45.249> versus<00:00:45.670> one<00:00:45.699> and

00:00:46.079 --> 00:00:46.089 
creeps behind I just one versus one and

00:00:46.089 --> 00:00:48.779 
creeps behind I just one versus one and
could<00:00:46.329> push<00:00:46.569> him<00:00:46.839> to<00:00:47.440> under<00:00:47.859> the<00:00:47.889> turret<00:00:48.129> so<00:00:48.550> it

00:00:48.779 --> 00:00:48.789 
could push him to under the turret so it

00:00:48.789 --> 00:00:51.479 
could push him to under the turret so it
was<00:00:48.999> fine<00:00:49.239> he<00:00:49.929> wasn't<00:00:50.379> tanky<00:00:50.979> who<00:00:51.159> wasn't
