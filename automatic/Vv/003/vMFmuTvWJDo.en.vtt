how it looks on my camera lens mine's 18
to<00:00:41.149> 55<00:00:42.149> millimeter<00:00:42.629> so<00:00:43.620> this<00:00:43.890> obviously<00:00:44.460> is<00:00:44.640> a

00:00:45.190 --> 00:00:45.200 
to 55 millimeter so this obviously is a

00:00:45.200 --> 00:00:48.290 
to 55 millimeter so this obviously is a
zoomed<00:00:46.200> out<00:00:46.289> at<00:00:46.440> 18<00:00:46.910> millimeters<00:00:47.910> and<00:00:48.180> then

00:00:48.290 --> 00:00:48.300 
zoomed out at 18 millimeters and then

00:00:48.300 --> 00:00:54.830 
zoomed out at 18 millimeters and then
this<00:00:48.480> is<00:00:48.950> zoomed<00:00:49.950> in<00:00:50.190> at<00:00:50.489> a<00:00:51.770> 55<00:00:53.480> all<00:00:54.480> right<00:00:54.690> now

and you can tell great about this point

00:01:31.500 --> 00:01:32.810 
and you can tell great about this point
is<00:01:31.650> when<00:01:31.770> you<00:01:31.890> really<00:01:32.189> start<00:01:32.400> to<00:01:32.460> notice<00:01:32.670> the

00:01:32.810 --> 00:01:32.820 
is when you really start to notice the

00:01:32.820 --> 00:01:35.899 
is when you really start to notice the
wide<00:01:33.090> angle<00:01:33.270> effects<00:01:34.549> particularly<00:01:35.549> you<00:01:35.880> know

00:01:35.899 --> 00:01:35.909 
wide angle effects particularly you know

00:01:35.909 --> 00:01:37.760 
wide angle effects particularly you know
around<00:01:36.210> these<00:01:36.360> regions<00:01:36.900> now<00:01:37.350> it's<00:01:37.500> a<00:01:37.560> little

00:01:37.760 --> 00:01:37.770 
around these regions now it's a little

00:01:37.770 --> 00:01:39.560 
around these regions now it's a little
bit<00:01:37.860> fuzzy<00:01:38.130> as<00:01:38.400> you<00:01:38.549> can<00:01:38.700> see<00:01:38.909> and<00:01:39.119> that<00:01:39.390> will

00:01:39.560 --> 00:01:39.570 
bit fuzzy as you can see and that will

00:01:39.570 --> 00:01:41.749 
bit fuzzy as you can see and that will
even<00:01:39.810> happen<00:01:39.960> in<00:01:40.200> many<00:01:40.350> of<00:01:40.530> your<00:01:40.640> in<00:01:41.640> your

00:01:41.749 --> 00:01:41.759 
even happen in many of your in your

00:01:41.759 --> 00:01:44.359 
even happen in many of your in your
pictures<00:01:42.180> but<00:01:42.509> to<00:01:42.750> me<00:01:43.439> it's<00:01:43.649> nothing<00:01:43.950> to<00:01:44.070> be

00:01:44.359 --> 00:01:44.369 
pictures but to me it's nothing to be

00:01:44.369 --> 00:01:46.069 
pictures but to me it's nothing to be
too<00:01:44.549> concerned<00:01:44.880> about<00:01:45.030> because<00:01:45.390> any<00:01:45.810> lens

00:01:46.069 --> 00:01:46.079 
too concerned about because any lens

00:01:46.079 --> 00:01:47.630 
too concerned about because any lens
that<00:01:46.380> where<00:01:46.770> this<00:01:46.860> is<00:01:46.920> going<00:01:47.130> to<00:01:47.189> be<00:01:47.280> clear<00:01:47.490> out

00:01:47.630 --> 00:01:47.640 
that where this is going to be clear out

00:01:47.640 --> 00:01:49.130 
that where this is going to be clear out
here<00:01:47.880> you're<00:01:48.270> gonna<00:01:48.329> spend<00:01:48.630> about<00:01:48.810> eight<00:01:49.110> nine

00:01:49.130 --> 00:01:49.140 
here you're gonna spend about eight nine

00:01:49.140 --> 00:01:51.469 
here you're gonna spend about eight nine
hundred<00:01:49.619> dollars<00:01:49.950> so<00:01:50.159> overall<00:01:51.030> it's<00:01:51.240> a<00:01:51.270> pretty

00:01:51.469 --> 00:01:51.479
