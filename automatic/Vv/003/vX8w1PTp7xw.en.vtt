00:01:38.350 --> 00:01:38.360 
of recreating my favorite tracks

00:01:38.360 --> 00:01:40.429 
of recreating my favorite tracks
certainly<00:01:39.360> it<00:01:39.570> didn't<00:01:39.900> feel<00:01:40.049> like<00:01:40.110> it<00:01:40.290> was

00:01:40.429 --> 00:01:40.439 
certainly it didn't feel like it was

00:01:40.439 --> 00:01:42.620 
certainly it didn't feel like it was
blowing<00:01:40.829> out<00:01:40.920> the<00:01:40.979> mids<00:01:41.280> too<00:01:41.490> much<00:01:41.790> the<00:01:42.119> bases

00:01:42.620 --> 00:01:42.630 
blowing out the mids too much the bases

00:01:42.630 --> 00:01:45.590 
blowing out the mids too much the bases
were<00:01:42.659> deep<00:01:43.079> and<00:01:43.759> overall<00:01:44.759> the<00:01:44.909> vocals<00:01:45.420> were

00:01:45.590 --> 00:01:45.600 
were deep and overall the vocals were

00:01:45.600 --> 00:01:47.330 
were deep and overall the vocals were
nicely<00:01:45.869> separated<00:01:46.290> which<00:01:47.040> is<00:01:47.159> quite

00:01:47.330 --> 00:01:47.340 
nicely separated which is quite

00:01:47.340 --> 00:01:49.670 
nicely separated which is quite
remarkable<00:01:47.520> for<00:01:48.000> just<00:01:48.149> a<00:01:48.210> mono<00:01:48.450> speaker<00:01:48.680> very

00:01:49.670 --> 00:01:49.680 
remarkable for just a mono speaker very

00:01:49.680 --> 00:01:51.649 
remarkable for just a mono speaker very
very<00:01:50.009> good<00:01:50.340> all<00:01:50.549> around<00:01:50.610> let's<00:01:51.420> talk<00:01:51.509> about

00:01:51.649 --> 00:01:51.659 
very good all around let's talk about

00:01:51.659 --> 00:01:54.740 
very good all around let's talk about
