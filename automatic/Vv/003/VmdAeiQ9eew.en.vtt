00:00:28.370 --> 00:00:28.380 
Doudna roulette you used to be that you

00:00:28.380 --> 00:00:29.990 
Doudna roulette you used to be that you
had<00:00:28.500> to<00:00:28.590> fake<00:00:28.800> grind<00:00:29.099> to<00:00:29.400> kind<00:00:29.580> of<00:00:29.609> like<00:00:29.820> get

00:00:29.990 --> 00:00:30.000 
had to fake grind to kind of like get

00:00:30.000 --> 00:00:31.700 
had to fake grind to kind of like get
some<00:00:30.210> levels<00:00:30.480> up<00:00:30.630> for<00:00:30.960> your<00:00:31.289> alternate

00:00:31.700 --> 00:00:31.710 
some levels up for your alternate

00:00:31.710 --> 00:00:34.069 
some levels up for your alternate
classes<00:00:32.160> but<00:00:32.790> this<00:00:33.090> actually<00:00:33.300> makes<00:00:33.660> it<00:00:33.840> so

00:00:34.069 --> 00:00:34.079 
classes but this actually makes it so

00:00:34.079 --> 00:00:35.780 
classes but this actually makes it so
that<00:00:34.110> you<00:00:34.680> could<00:00:34.829> actually<00:00:35.040> help<00:00:35.370> out<00:00:35.579> other

00:00:35.780 --> 00:00:35.790 
that you could actually help out other

00:00:35.790 --> 00:00:37.430 
that you could actually help out other
people<00:00:35.880> while<00:00:36.570> you're<00:00:36.719> trying<00:00:36.930> to<00:00:36.989> level<00:00:37.260> and

00:00:37.430 --> 00:00:37.440 
people while you're trying to level and

00:00:37.440 --> 00:00:40.330 
people while you're trying to level and
you<00:00:38.190> don't<00:00:38.340> really<00:00:38.700> have<00:00:38.820> so<00:00:39.360> much<00:00:39.510> the

00:00:40.330 --> 00:00:40.340 
you don't really have so much the

00:00:40.340 --> 00:00:42.799 
you don't really have so much the
waiting<00:00:41.340> around<00:00:41.700> kind<00:00:42.030> of<00:00:42.090> thing<00:00:42.239> for<00:00:42.480> fates

00:00:42.799 --> 00:00:42.809 
waiting around kind of thing for fates

00:00:42.809 --> 00:00:46.040 
waiting around kind of thing for fates
and<00:00:43.820> it<00:00:44.820> makes<00:00:45.000> a<00:00:45.090> little<00:00:45.180> bit<00:00:45.300> more<00:00:45.390> fun<00:00:45.690> in<00:00:45.899> my

00:00:46.040 --> 00:00:46.050 
and it makes a little bit more fun in my

00:00:46.050 --> 00:00:48.410 
and it makes a little bit more fun in my
opinion<00:00:46.469> so<00:00:46.980> duty<00:00:47.280> roulette<00:00:47.579> opens<00:00:48.270> up

00:00:48.410 --> 00:00:48.420 
opinion so duty roulette opens up

00:00:48.420 --> 00:00:51.410 
opinion so duty roulette opens up
basically<00:00:49.260> based<00:00:49.590> on<00:00:49.770> your<00:00:49.920> level<00:00:50.180> so<00:00:51.180> you'll

00:00:51.410 --> 00:00:51.420 
basically based on your level so you'll

00:00:51.420 --> 00:00:53.630 
basically based on your level so you'll
see<00:00:51.660> most<00:00:52.320> of<00:00:52.440> them<00:00:52.649> will<00:00:52.770> either<00:00:52.890> not<00:00:53.160> show<00:00:53.430> or

00:00:53.630 --> 00:00:53.640 
see most of them will either not show or

00:00:53.640 --> 00:00:56.810 
see most of them will either not show or
be<00:00:53.820> locked<00:00:54.059> and<00:00:55.129> once<00:00:56.129> you<00:00:56.250> start<00:00:56.460> progressing

00:00:56.810 --> 00:00:56.820 
be locked and once you start progressing

00:01:33.950 --> 00:01:33.960 
I mean it's a pretty cool feature you

00:01:33.960 --> 00:01:36.080 
I mean it's a pretty cool feature you
get<00:01:34.290> some<00:01:34.439> reputation<00:01:34.680> from<00:01:35.250> it<00:01:35.520> so<00:01:35.820> it<00:01:35.880> makes

00:01:36.080 --> 00:01:36.090 
get some reputation from it so it makes

00:01:36.090 --> 00:01:40.160 
get some reputation from it so it makes
you<00:01:36.210> look<00:01:36.869> like<00:01:37.079> a<00:01:37.110> good<00:01:37.350> player<00:01:37.939> also<00:01:39.170> it's

00:01:40.160 --> 00:01:40.170 
you look like a good player also it's

00:01:40.170 --> 00:01:42.530 
you look like a good player also it's
it's<00:01:40.590> a<00:01:40.890> bit<00:01:41.040> it's<00:01:41.520> a<00:01:41.610> bit<00:01:41.759> less<00:01:42.000> grinding<00:01:42.299> I

00:01:42.530 --> 00:01:42.540 
it's a bit it's a bit less grinding I

00:01:42.540 --> 00:01:45.679 
it's a bit it's a bit less grinding I
guess<00:01:42.689> if<00:01:42.840> you<00:01:42.930> do<00:01:43.079> it<00:01:43.229> a<00:01:43.409> lot<00:01:44.329> and<00:01:45.329> you<00:01:45.479> get<00:01:45.600> the

00:01:45.679 --> 00:01:45.689 
guess if you do it a lot and you get the

00:01:45.689 --> 00:01:47.389 
guess if you do it a lot and you get the
same<00:01:45.869> dungeon<00:01:46.200> over<00:01:46.530> and<00:01:46.680> over<00:01:46.890> again<00:01:46.979> then<00:01:47.340> I

00:01:47.389 --> 00:01:47.399 
same dungeon over and over again then I

00:01:47.399 --> 00:01:49.340 
same dungeon over and over again then I
could<00:01:47.729> get<00:01:47.880> pretty<00:01:48.030> grindy<00:01:48.509> but<00:01:49.020> in<00:01:49.200> my

00:01:49.340 --> 00:01:49.350 
could get pretty grindy but in my

00:01:49.350 --> 00:01:51.350 
could get pretty grindy but in my
opinion<00:01:49.470> is<00:01:50.009> it's<00:01:50.430> a<00:01:50.490> lot<00:01:50.729> better<00:01:50.850> than<00:01:50.970> faker

00:01:51.350 --> 00:01:51.360 
opinion is it's a lot better than faker

00:01:51.360 --> 00:01:53.660 
opinion is it's a lot better than faker

00:04:03.050 --> 00:04:03.060 
alternate stuff without doing some of
