00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.410
 Hello Youtube friends 

00:00:02.410 --> 00:00:07.710
 today I will tell you how to download and install long a sketch budokai tenkaichi 3 

00:00:07.710 --> 00:00:09.429
 for pc 

00:00:09.429 --> 00:00:12.809
 good what you have to do is download the game first 

00:00:13.769 --> 00:00:16.999
 I'll leave the download in the description of the video 

00:00:17.900 --> 00:00:22.050
 Once the download is done, unzip if something like this will appear 

00:00:24.179 --> 00:00:28.729
 Well the truth is that I recommend installing it with raymond tulsa since not 

00:00:28.729 --> 00:00:31.199
 you need to extract it again 

00:00:31.199 --> 00:00:34.280
 however if they want they do 

00:00:34.280 --> 00:00:38.620
 but I'm going to do it with the monusco one, although I'll also leave it as 

00:00:38.620 --> 00:00:41.230
 download in the description 

00:00:41.230 --> 00:00:43.410
 we installed the demons tubul 

00:00:43.410 --> 00:00:49.410
 surely we will restart the pc after this we will ask for updates 

00:00:49.410 --> 00:00:53.070
 we do and we already have the one of the monster in which we will see it like this 

00:00:54.150 --> 00:00:59.120
 after having ready this we go to demons tunnel which we will find 

00:00:59.120 --> 00:01:04.280
 here on this date and then we give you a right click on it and we go to 

00:01:04.280 --> 00:01:07.539
 first that says manager mount river and we click 

00:01:07.539 --> 00:01:11.950
 we click on the green cross that we see here says you added the file 

00:01:11.950 --> 00:01:15.619
 and we look for our game where we decompress 

00:01:16.390 --> 00:01:20.819
 we open it and something like this will appear, select the file 

00:01:22.990 --> 00:01:27.940
 then we play and a window opens as if it were to be installed as 

00:01:27.939 --> 00:01:30.360
 city 

00:01:30.360 --> 00:01:33.810
 we give it a run and it will open a window like this 

00:01:36.050 --> 00:01:39.370
 then we give you install then next following 

00:01:39.950 --> 00:01:43.370
 well you already know that this is not easy to cut 

00:01:43.870 --> 00:01:48.640
 the truth is that I did not install it because I already have it but well once 

00:01:48.640 --> 00:01:52.630
 instigate insurance it will take a while to open the window of the 

00:01:52.630 --> 00:01:55.710
 installation since that done with the wii emulator 

00:01:56.280 --> 00:01:59.400
 then once installed I will tell you how it is 

00:01:59.940 --> 00:02:04.490
 good ps once and has installed you will be left a shortcut in the 

00:02:04.490 --> 00:02:05.680
 desk 

00:02:05.680 --> 00:02:10.480
 Well, if you do not see the shortcut, simply go where it is 

00:02:10.479 --> 00:02:15.840
 installed the game and we look for an image that says of bz verte 3 villa with this one 

00:02:15.840 --> 00:02:17.539
 in sections the game 

00:02:17.539 --> 00:02:21.819
 but watch out if you want to save your game you should not execute as 

00:02:21.819 --> 00:02:22.790
 administrator 

00:02:22.790 --> 00:02:26.150
 if you hear that it is seeing executas as administrator 

00:02:26.709 --> 00:02:29.730
 this game already comes with the default settings 

00:02:30.739 --> 00:02:34.950
 but if you want to change the options like graphics or sound because 

00:02:34.950 --> 00:02:37.730
 your pc is a crap in graphics 

00:02:37.730 --> 00:02:42.250
 you go where the game is installed and you go to this program called 

00:02:42.250 --> 00:02:46.840
 dolphin and you open it will appear like that and well there you have the options of 

00:02:46.840 --> 00:02:50.980
 configure it with your control and graphics depending on your pc 

00:02:50.980 --> 00:02:55.940
 then we give the folder to open and we go where the game is installed 

00:02:55.940 --> 00:03:00.670
 and we select the one that says tries and we open it and the game will be opened with the 

00:03:00.670 --> 00:03:05.640
 new configuration and when we want to open it again we can do it with 

00:03:05.640 --> 00:03:10.340
 the direct access of the desktop executing them as administrator and 

00:03:10.340 --> 00:03:13.900
 will come with the new configurations since it is saved only 

00:03:14.429 --> 00:03:19.700
 and well here you have another game for you to kill time friends that's all 

00:03:19.700 --> 00:03:22.409
 if they need something they just comment 

00:03:22.409 --> 00:03:23.069
 Thank you
