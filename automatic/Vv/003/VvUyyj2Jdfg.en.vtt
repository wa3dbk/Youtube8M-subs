 hello girls I am in this video I am going to 

00:00:04.680 --> 00:00:11.789
 give a trick for when you make a 

00:00:08.250 --> 00:00:14.730
 hairline on a fingernail can fix it put 

00:00:11.789 --> 00:00:17.460
 a kind of patch so that the 

00:00:14.730 --> 00:00:19.140
 nail so we do not have to cut it at 

00:00:17.460 --> 00:00:20.670
 monkfish if we have the other long 

00:00:19.140 --> 00:00:22.770
 so we can continue with this lady 

00:00:20.670 --> 00:00:25.680
 long or the one that has been broken so I 

00:00:22.770 --> 00:00:27.869
 I'm going to show here that I have a hairline 

00:00:25.680 --> 00:00:29.580
 I made it by cutting vegetables in the 

00:00:27.869 --> 00:00:32.489
 kitchen with a knife 

00:00:29.580 --> 00:00:34.559
 This is a what grows if you do not see me 

00:00:32.489 --> 00:00:35.309
 protejo will split and I will have it 

00:00:34.559 --> 00:00:37.920
 cut 

00:00:35.309 --> 00:00:41.399
 then to keep it long 

00:00:37.920 --> 00:00:42.929
 they sell some patches but for the function 

00:00:41.399 --> 00:00:45.179
 they are therefore a bit expensive and the 

00:00:42.929 --> 00:00:47.820
 truth is that being able to have something in 

00:00:45.179 --> 00:00:49.739
 house to put it on so everyone 

00:00:47.820 --> 00:00:53.010
 we have then it's not worth it 

00:00:49.739 --> 00:00:57.059
 buy them what we have to use to 

00:00:53.010 --> 00:00:58.500
 for the arrangements is a tea bag or 

00:00:57.059 --> 00:01:00.839
 of infusion or what we have for 

00:00:58.500 --> 00:01:02.879
 cup is worth with paper what we have 

00:01:00.839 --> 00:01:05.759
 what to do is open the bag and stretch 

00:01:02.879 --> 00:01:09.000
 well the paper would be a little thing like that 

00:01:05.759 --> 00:01:11.850
 ok this is already a bit used then 

00:01:09.000 --> 00:01:13.319
 with the nail cut a piece that is left 

00:01:11.850 --> 00:01:14.710
 irregular so that afterwards the 

00:01:13.319 --> 00:01:18.030
 borders 

00:01:14.710 --> 00:01:20.760
 It would be a little thing like that 

00:01:18.030 --> 00:01:23.310
 and then with a transparent glaze 

00:01:20.760 --> 00:01:25.140
 a fortifying base anything and 

00:01:23.310 --> 00:01:28.170
 any glaze so I have no color 

00:01:25.140 --> 00:01:31.430
 that we have at home we put a 

00:01:28.170 --> 00:01:31.430
 little in the area 

00:01:31.520 --> 00:01:38.649
 and with tweezers or with the same hand 

00:01:34.630 --> 00:01:42.470
 we take the piece that we have cut and 

00:01:38.649 --> 00:01:45.670
 we put it on top 

00:01:42.470 --> 00:01:45.670
 over the broken 

00:01:45.770 --> 00:01:50.570
 with this what we get is that 

00:01:48.859 --> 00:01:53.359
 make a protective layer above 

00:01:50.570 --> 00:01:55.050
 then the nail just left us with 

00:01:53.359 --> 00:01:57.300
 a stick 

00:01:55.050 --> 00:02:00.530
 now we crush it well so that it 

00:01:57.300 --> 00:02:04.200
 is well attached to the nail and what about 

00:02:00.530 --> 00:02:05.940
 if the cut is well to the tip 

00:02:04.200 --> 00:02:07.860
 then we have to leave a piece 

00:02:05.940 --> 00:02:09.979
 on the outside in what about putting it back 

00:02:07.860 --> 00:02:13.069
 this way with the stick 

00:02:09.979 --> 00:02:15.140
 that ends on both sides if it is 

00:02:13.069 --> 00:02:17.989
 quite large the cut well the ideal 

00:02:15.140 --> 00:02:19.640
 is to put several layers later if you notice 

00:02:17.989 --> 00:02:20.900
 So much polish a little bit with the cue 

00:02:19.640 --> 00:02:23.870
 polisher 

00:02:20.900 --> 00:02:26.170
 then well is the 

00:02:23.870 --> 00:02:26.170
 cut 

00:02:28.319 --> 00:02:33.629
 that way the cut would be well covered 

00:02:31.980 --> 00:02:37.370
 this way we can get that nail 

00:02:33.629 --> 00:02:40.099
 keep growing without breaking 

00:02:37.370 --> 00:02:42.319
 well then I hope this trick 

00:02:40.099 --> 00:02:45.670
 I have served you and see you in the 

00:02:42.319 --> 00:02:45.670
 next advice thank you very much
