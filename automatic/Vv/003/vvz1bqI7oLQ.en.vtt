00:00:12.170 --> 00:00:16.020
 as if nature itself had this garden 

00:00:15.240 --> 00:00:18.300
 created 

00:00:16.020 --> 00:00:22.910
 he exudes the joy of life and awakens 

00:00:18.300 --> 00:00:22.910
 memories of happy children's days 

00:00:28.470 --> 00:00:33.340
 to create natural gardens but is a high 

00:00:31.210 --> 00:00:35.260
 art, though, became the idyl of 

00:00:33.340 --> 00:00:37.480
 Landscaper planned and built 

00:00:35.260 --> 00:00:39.940
 but she becomes quite natural 

00:00:37.480 --> 00:00:40.660
 One suspects the human hand, however, sees it 

00:00:39.940 --> 00:00:42.940
 barely 

00:00:40.660 --> 00:00:44.620
 the landscape gardener makes sure that 

00:00:42.940 --> 00:00:47.170
 Nature feels good in the garden 

00:00:44.620 --> 00:00:49.720
 local wild herbs and shrubs lure 

00:00:47.170 --> 00:00:51.550
 Insects on umbelliferae are popular 

00:00:49.720 --> 00:00:55.030
 some were planted 

00:00:51.550 --> 00:00:57.070
 others came from alone 

00:00:55.030 --> 00:00:59.650
 landscape gardener conducts nature 

00:00:57.070 --> 00:01:02.050
 very carefully he attacks so much 

00:00:59.650 --> 00:01:04.449
 as necessary and as little as possible 

00:01:02.050 --> 00:01:07.740
 Frogs settle on the meet 

00:01:04.449 --> 00:01:07.740
 Ponds with life 

00:01:08.740 --> 00:01:12.670
 also exotics like the red flitzer horn 

00:01:10.780 --> 00:01:15.399
 can correctly place one 

00:01:12.670 --> 00:01:17.830
 enrich natural garden and a green 

00:01:15.399 --> 00:01:20.640
 roof leaves the house with the garden 

00:01:17.830 --> 00:01:20.640
 merge 

00:01:21.210 --> 00:01:25.369
 The landscape gardener works with you 

00:01:23.330 --> 00:01:27.510
 natural materials become the ponds 

00:01:25.369 --> 00:01:30.300
 exclusively of compacted clay 

00:01:27.510 --> 00:01:32.850
 shaped with the excavation and natural stones 

00:01:30.300 --> 00:01:34.619
 he models the landscape around everyone 

00:01:32.850 --> 00:01:38.869
 to give pond dwellers a chance 

00:01:34.619 --> 00:01:38.869
 get fish separated areas 

00:01:42.130 --> 00:01:47.560
 Decorations fit in completely 

00:01:43.970 --> 00:01:47.560
 of course in the garden 

00:01:51.150 --> 00:01:58.430
 the sparse elk with their simple ones 

00:01:53.880 --> 00:01:58.430
 open flowers offers its nectar 

00:02:01.240 --> 00:02:05.930
 running water becomes a natural bath 

00:02:03.649 --> 00:02:07.670
 Foils and plastic elements are for 

00:02:05.930 --> 00:02:10.900
 the landscape gardener in natural gardens 

00:02:07.670 --> 00:02:14.120
 taboo he knows how it works differently 

00:02:10.900 --> 00:02:16.489
 nature knows no straight the whole 

00:02:14.120 --> 00:02:18.830
 garden swings you say the nature is 

00:02:16.489 --> 00:02:20.300
 the best garden designer is also right 

00:02:18.830 --> 00:02:23.920
 especially if the 

00:02:20.300 --> 00:02:23.920
 landscape gardener supports her
