last color here and let's just see how

00:00:15.120 --> 00:00:42.050 
last color here and let's just see how
I've<00:00:15.240> been<00:00:15.330> doing<00:00:15.390> this

00:00:42.050 --> 00:00:42.060 

00:00:42.060 --> 00:00:46.250 

I<00:00:42.150> handed<00:00:43.140> work<00:00:43.320> I<00:00:43.560> ended<00:00:43.740> up<00:00:44.660> starting<00:00:45.660> out<00:00:45.960> by

00:00:46.250 --> 00:00:46.260 
I handed work I ended up starting out by

00:00:46.260 --> 00:00:47.840 
I handed work I ended up starting out by
projecting<00:00:47.130> an<00:00:47.220> image<00:00:47.340> on<00:00:47.580> the<00:00:47.700> wall

00:00:47.840 --> 00:00:47.850 
projecting an image on the wall

00:00:47.850 --> 00:00:52.550 
projecting an image on the wall
projector<00:00:48.600> I<00:00:48.630> borrow<00:00:48.900> at<00:00:49.170> work<00:00:51.230> once<00:00:52.230> I<00:00:52.350> get

00:00:52.550 --> 00:00:52.560 
projector I borrow at work once I get

00:00:52.560 --> 00:00:55.850 
projector I borrow at work once I get
that<00:00:53.390> the<00:00:54.390> image<00:00:54.600> was<00:00:55.050> the<00:00:55.110> pencil<00:00:55.650> light

00:00:55.850 --> 00:00:55.860 
that the image was the pencil light

00:00:55.860 --> 00:00:57.590 
that the image was the pencil light
beyond<00:00:56.130> the<00:00:56.280> walls<00:00:56.490> of<00:00:56.640> see<00:00:57.090> where<00:00:57.270> it<00:00:57.390> would

00:00:57.590 --> 00:00:57.600 
beyond the walls of see where it would

00:00:57.600 --> 00:00:58.400 
beyond the walls of see where it would
have<00:00:57.630> to<00:00:57.900> go

00:00:58.400 --> 00:00:58.410 
have to go

00:00:58.410 --> 00:01:04.250 
have to go
I<00:00:59.240> debated<00:01:00.240> whether<00:01:00.690> or<00:01:01.200> not<00:01:01.320> to<00:01:01.440> use<00:01:03.260> masking

00:01:04.250 --> 00:01:04.260 
I debated whether or not to use masking

00:01:04.260 --> 00:01:06.110 
I debated whether or not to use masking
tape<00:01:04.320> to<00:01:04.650> mask<00:01:04.800> off<00:01:05.130> each<00:01:05.339> individual<00:01:05.940> squares

00:01:06.110 --> 00:01:06.120 
tape to mask off each individual squares

00:01:06.120 --> 00:01:07.790 
tape to mask off each individual squares
and<00:01:06.540> think<00:01:06.720> of<00:01:06.840> why<00:01:07.020> I<00:01:07.050> didn't<00:01:07.560> do<00:01:07.650> that

00:01:07.790 --> 00:01:07.800 
and think of why I didn't do that

00:01:07.800 --> 00:01:10.450 
and think of why I didn't do that
because<00:01:07.980> that<00:01:08.250> would<00:01:08.370> see<00:01:08.610> them<00:01:08.760> forever

00:01:10.450 --> 00:01:10.460 
because that would see them forever

00:01:10.460 --> 00:01:15.320 
because that would see them forever
instead<00:01:11.460> I<00:01:11.880> decided<00:01:12.240> to<00:01:13.250> paint<00:01:14.330> each

00:01:15.320 --> 00:01:15.330 
instead I decided to paint each

00:01:15.330 --> 00:01:20.120 
instead I decided to paint each
individual<00:01:15.869> square<00:01:16.170> so<00:01:16.979> I<00:01:17.750> think<00:01:18.750> so<00:01:19.740> far<00:01:19.979> it's

00:01:20.120 --> 00:01:20.130 
individual square so I think so far it's

00:01:20.130 --> 00:01:22.730 
individual square so I think so far it's
pretty<00:01:20.190> not<00:01:20.490> pretty<00:01:20.520> well<00:01:21.170> and<00:01:22.170> once<00:01:22.380> it's<00:01:22.590> all

00:01:22.730 --> 00:01:22.740 
pretty not pretty well and once it's all

00:01:22.740 --> 00:01:26.210 
pretty not pretty well and once it's all
done<00:01:23.040> I<00:01:23.220> plan<00:01:23.550> on<00:01:23.580> posting<00:01:23.910> a<00:01:24.210> picture<00:01:24.479> of<00:01:25.220> the

00:01:26.210 --> 00:01:26.220 
done I plan on posting a picture of the

00:01:26.220 --> 00:01:32.630 
done I plan on posting a picture of the
completed<00:01:26.630> Bureau<00:01:28.340> along<00:01:29.340> with<00:01:30.530> the<00:01:31.640> picture

00:01:32.630 --> 00:01:32.640 
completed Bureau along with the picture

00:01:32.640 --> 00:01:35.210 
completed Bureau along with the picture
that<00:01:32.790> would<00:01:32.940> be<00:01:33.060> inspiration<00:01:33.720> for<00:01:33.869> this<00:01:34.220> which

00:01:35.210 --> 00:01:35.220 
that would be inspiration for this which

00:01:35.220 --> 00:01:38.530 
that would be inspiration for this which
is<00:01:36.290> what<00:01:37.290> you're<00:01:37.440> looking<00:01:37.530> at<00:01:37.770> is<00:01:37.890> becoming

00:01:38.530 --> 00:01:38.540 
is what you're looking at is becoming

00:01:38.540 --> 00:01:41.120 
is what you're looking at is becoming
one<00:01:39.540> of<00:01:39.660> the<00:01:39.750> walls<00:01:40.110> in<00:01:40.350> Eugene's<00:01:40.710> isn't<00:01:41.070> in

00:01:41.120 --> 00:01:41.130 
one of the walls in Eugene's isn't in

00:01:41.130 --> 00:01:44.330 
one of the walls in Eugene's isn't in
flavor<00:01:41.400> so<00:01:42.320> once<00:01:43.320> it's<00:01:43.530> all<00:01:43.650> done<00:01:43.979> we'll<00:01:44.310> have

00:01:44.330 --> 00:01:44.340 
flavor so once it's all done we'll have

00:01:44.340 --> 00:01:49.430 
flavor so once it's all done we'll have
a<00:01:46.640> pretty<00:01:47.640> fun<00:01:47.940> place<00:01:48.240> fun<00:01:48.690> area<00:01:49.050> for<00:01:49.200> him<00:01:49.320> to

00:01:49.430 --> 00:01:49.440 
a pretty fun place fun area for him to

00:01:49.440 --> 00:01:55.160 
a pretty fun place fun area for him to
play<00:01:49.619> in<00:01:50.840> and<00:01:51.840> I<00:01:52.830> will<00:01:52.890> have<00:01:53.190> a<00:01:53.910> lot<00:01:54.840> of<00:01:54.869> pride

00:01:55.160 --> 00:01:55.170 
play in and I will have a lot of pride

00:01:55.170 --> 00:01:57.290 
play in and I will have a lot of pride
knowing<00:01:55.500> that<00:01:55.860> and<00:01:56.490> put<00:01:56.759> together<00:01:56.850> something

00:01:57.290 --> 00:01:57.300 
knowing that and put together something

00:01:57.300 --> 00:01:59.779 
knowing that and put together something
that<00:01:57.800> should<00:01:58.800> last<00:01:58.979> a<00:01:59.160> good<00:01:59.340> number<00:01:59.490> of<00:01:59.640> years

00:01:59.779 --> 00:01:59.789 
that should last a good number of years

00:01:59.789 --> 00:02:02.020 
that should last a good number of years
and<00:02:00.060> will<00:02:00.210> really<00:02:00.330> appreciate<00:02:00.569> this<00:02:01.110> so<00:02:01.380> I

00:02:07.880 --> 00:02:07.890 
the squares that I'm doing because I'm

00:02:07.890 --> 00:02:10.580 
the squares that I'm doing because I'm
sure<00:02:08.130> at<00:02:09.119> that<00:02:09.179> point<00:02:09.420> I'll<00:02:10.110> probably<00:02:10.170> have

00:02:10.580 --> 00:02:10.590 
sure at that point I'll probably have

00:02:10.590 --> 00:02:16.070 
sure at that point I'll probably have
lost<00:02:10.800> 95%<00:02:11.520> of<00:02:12.000> viewers<00:02:13.220> how<00:02:14.220> do<00:02:14.880> I<00:02:15.270> look
