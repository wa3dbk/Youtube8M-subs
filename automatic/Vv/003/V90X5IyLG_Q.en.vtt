00:01:01.590 --> 00:01:01.600 
and I think I'm best on the 3-meter

00:01:01.600 --> 00:01:03.930 
and I think I'm best on the 3-meter
board<00:01:01.870> usually<00:01:02.590> at<00:01:03.129> competitions<00:01:03.699> I'll<00:01:03.820> do

00:01:03.930 --> 00:01:03.940 
board usually at competitions I'll do

00:01:03.940 --> 00:01:05.760

better<00:01:04.030> on<00:01:04.180> one<00:01:04.390> meter<00:01:04.600> but<00:01:05.170> I<00:01:05.199> think<00:01:05.530> if<00:01:05.650> I

00:01:05.760 --> 00:01:05.770 
better on one meter but I think if I

00:01:05.770 --> 00:01:07.350 
better on one meter but I think if I
really<00:01:06.070> like<00:01:06.190> step<00:01:06.490> it<00:01:06.610> up<00:01:06.700> and<00:01:06.850> dive<00:01:06.970> my<00:01:07.150> best

00:01:10.650 --> 00:01:10.660 
is a great experience that was an

00:01:10.660 --> 00:01:13.080 
is a great experience that was an
experience<00:01:11.230> but<00:01:11.380> a<00:01:11.440> stepping-stone<00:01:12.090> he's

00:01:13.080 --> 00:01:13.090 
experience but a stepping-stone he's

00:01:13.090 --> 00:01:15.330 
experience but a stepping-stone he's
been<00:01:13.330> through<00:01:13.630> quite<00:01:13.990> a<00:01:14.080> few<00:01:14.380> experiences<00:01:14.590> but

00:01:15.330 --> 00:01:15.340 
been through quite a few experiences but

00:01:15.340 --> 00:01:17.490 
been through quite a few experiences but
this<00:01:15.490> is<00:01:15.700> I<00:01:16.030> think<00:01:16.240> a<00:01:16.570> real<00:01:16.780> big<00:01:17.020> stepping

00:01:17.490 --> 00:01:17.500

this is I think a real big stepping
stone<00:01:17.530> for<00:01:17.979> him<00:01:18.070> to<00:01:18.189> make<00:01:18.369> the<00:01:18.549> national<00:01:19.060> team

00:01:19.080 --> 00:01:19.090 
stone for him to make the national team

00:01:19.090 --> 00:01:21.330

00:01:30.060 --> 00:01:30.070 
have been a junior nationals a couple

00:01:30.070 --> 00:01:31.390 
have been a junior nationals a couple
times

00:01:31.390 --> 00:01:31.400 
times

00:01:31.400 --> 00:01:34.450 
times
I<00:01:31.450> was<00:01:32.450> on<00:01:32.600> one<00:01:32.900> junior<00:01:33.320> world<00:01:33.500> team<00:01:33.770> we<00:01:34.280> went

00:01:34.450 --> 00:01:34.460 
I was on one junior world team we went

00:01:34.460 --> 00:01:36.730 
I was on one junior world team we went
to<00:01:34.580> Australia<00:01:34.670> in<00:01:35.210> 2012<00:01:35.780> and<00:01:36.470> that<00:01:36.620> was

00:01:36.730 --> 00:01:36.740 
to Australia in 2012 and that was

00:01:36.740 --> 00:01:37.900 
to Australia in 2012 and that was
probably<00:01:36.860> the<00:01:37.070> highlight<00:01:37.280> of<00:01:37.430> my<00:01:37.580> career<00:01:37.670> so

00:01:37.900 --> 00:01:37.910 
probably the highlight of my career so

00:01:37.910 --> 00:01:39.640 
probably the highlight of my career so
far<00:01:38.060> I<00:01:38.510> think<00:01:38.660> it's<00:01:38.780> helped<00:01:38.990> me<00:01:39.080> a<00:01:39.110> lot<00:01:39.380> like

00:01:39.640 --> 00:01:39.650 
far I think it's helped me a lot like

00:01:39.650 --> 00:01:41.170 
far I think it's helped me a lot like
I've<00:01:39.800> never<00:01:39.950> been<00:01:40.070> so<00:01:40.610> nervous<00:01:40.640> in<00:01:41.030> my<00:01:41.090> life

00:01:41.170 --> 00:01:41.180 
I've never been so nervous in my life

00:01:41.180 --> 00:01:43.720 
I've never been so nervous in my life
before<00:01:41.540> that<00:01:41.720> and<00:01:42.170> so<00:01:42.860> I<00:01:42.920> think<00:01:43.040> I<00:01:43.310> like<00:01:43.550> if<00:01:43.670> I

00:01:43.720 --> 00:01:43.730 
before that and so I think I like if I
