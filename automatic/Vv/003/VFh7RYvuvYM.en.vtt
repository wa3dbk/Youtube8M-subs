writer of good streak phantom detective
I<00:00:31.480> first<00:00:32.230> started<00:00:32.559> thinking<00:00:32.860> about<00:00:33.059> doing

00:00:34.049 --> 00:00:34.059 
I first started thinking about doing

00:00:34.059 --> 00:00:36.270 
I first started thinking about doing
something<00:00:34.660> like<00:00:34.780> ghost<00:00:35.140> trick<00:00:35.410> right<00:00:35.920> after<00:00:36.250> I

00:00:36.270 --> 00:00:36.280 
something like ghost trick right after I

00:00:36.280 --> 00:00:37.890 
something like ghost trick right after I
finished<00:00:36.610> the<00:00:36.790> third<00:00:36.970> Ace<00:00:37.210> Attorney<00:00:37.239> game<00:00:37.780> in

finished the third Ace Attorney game in

00:00:37.900 --> 00:00:41.790 
finished the third Ace Attorney game in
Japan<00:00:38.290> which<00:00:38.739> was<00:00:38.890> back<00:00:39.070> in<00:00:39.220> 2004<00:00:40.800> originally

00:00:41.790 --> 00:00:41.800 
Japan which was back in 2004 originally

00:00:41.800 --> 00:00:44.160 
Japan which was back in 2004 originally
you<00:00:42.040> know<00:00:42.070> I<00:00:42.400> had<00:00:42.940> this<00:00:43.330> character<00:00:43.840> and<00:00:43.989> he<00:00:44.050> was

00:00:44.160 --> 00:00:44.170 
you know I had this character and he was

00:00:44.170 --> 00:00:45.600 
you know I had this character and he was
going<00:00:44.320> to<00:00:44.350> be<00:00:44.500> a<00:00:44.530> ghost<00:00:44.769> and<00:00:45.129> he<00:00:45.370> was<00:00:45.460> going<00:00:45.550> to

00:00:45.600 --> 00:00:45.610 
going to be a ghost and he was going to

00:00:45.610 --> 00:00:47.720 
going to be a ghost and he was going to
be<00:00:45.760> able<00:00:45.820> to<00:00:46.059> do<00:00:46.210> almost<00:00:46.449> anything<00:00:47.079> you<00:00:47.260> wanted

00:00:47.720 --> 00:00:47.730 
be able to do almost anything you wanted

00:00:47.730 --> 00:00:50.729 
be able to do almost anything you wanted
but<00:00:48.730> then<00:00:48.910> over<00:00:49.390> time<00:00:49.750> at<00:00:50.140> the<00:00:50.410> more<00:00:50.559> I<00:00:50.590> thought

00:00:50.729 --> 00:00:50.739 
but then over time at the more I thought

00:00:50.739 --> 00:00:54.049 
but then over time at the more I thought
about<00:00:50.800> it<00:00:51.040> the<00:00:51.130> more<00:00:51.220> I<00:00:51.370> felt<00:00:51.550> that<00:00:51.670> it<00:00:51.880> was<00:00:52.770> too

00:00:54.049 --> 00:00:54.059 
about it the more I felt that it was too

00:00:54.059 --> 00:00:56.310 
about it the more I felt that it was too
complicated<00:00:55.059> and<00:00:55.660> you<00:00:55.809> could<00:00:55.960> do<00:00:56.050> too<00:00:56.230> many

00:00:56.310 --> 00:00:56.320 
complicated and you could do too many

00:00:56.320 --> 00:00:58.049 
complicated and you could do too many
things<00:00:56.469> and<00:00:56.920> so<00:00:57.100> rather<00:00:57.280> than<00:00:57.520> having<00:00:57.579> such<00:00:57.969> an

00:00:58.049 --> 00:00:58.059 
things and so rather than having such an

00:00:58.059 --> 00:01:00.090 
things and so rather than having such an
overly<00:00:58.450> complex<00:00:58.840> game<00:00:59.230> maybe<00:00:59.770> you'd<00:00:59.980> better

00:01:00.090 --> 00:01:00.100 
overly complex game maybe you'd better

00:01:00.100 --> 00:01:02.069 
overly complex game maybe you'd better
just<00:01:00.399> simplify<00:01:00.850> it<00:01:00.910> so<00:01:01.390> now<00:01:01.510> what<00:01:01.660> you<00:01:01.780> see<00:01:01.960> in

00:01:02.069 --> 00:01:02.079 
just simplify it so now what you see in

00:01:02.079 --> 00:01:03.389 
just simplify it so now what you see in
the<00:01:02.200> game<00:01:02.379> and<00:01:02.559> the<00:01:02.770> final<00:01:03.070> version<00:01:03.190> in<00:01:03.370> the

00:01:03.389 --> 00:01:03.399 
the game and the final version in the

00:01:03.399 --> 00:01:06.320 
the game and the final version in the
game<00:01:03.640> is<00:01:03.820> a<00:01:04.449> very<00:01:04.899> simplistic<00:01:05.110> approach<00:01:05.560> to

00:01:06.320 --> 00:01:06.330 
game is a very simplistic approach to

00:01:06.330 --> 00:01:08.910 
game is a very simplistic approach to
using<00:01:07.330> the<00:01:07.570> touch<00:01:07.750> panel<00:01:07.990> to<00:01:08.440> control<00:01:08.770> your

00:01:08.910 --> 00:01:08.920 
using the touch panel to control your

00:01:08.920 --> 00:01:10.710 
using the touch panel to control your
character<00:01:09.310> and<00:01:09.460> then<00:01:09.910> also<00:01:10.119> you<00:01:10.270> only<00:01:10.539> have

00:01:10.710 --> 00:01:10.720 
character and then also you only have

00:01:10.720 --> 00:01:12.389 
character and then also you only have
two<00:01:10.869> commands<00:01:11.229> you<00:01:11.380> have<00:01:11.530> the<00:01:11.890> possess<00:01:12.190> and

00:01:12.389 --> 00:01:12.399 
two commands you have the possess and

00:01:12.399 --> 00:01:13.830 
two commands you have the possess and
the<00:01:12.460> manipulate<00:01:12.940> the<00:01:13.119> goshen<00:01:13.450> the<00:01:13.570> trick

00:01:13.830 --> 00:01:13.840 
the manipulate the goshen the trick

00:01:13.840 --> 00:01:16.230 
the manipulate the goshen the trick
commands<00:01:14.380> and<00:01:15.130> so<00:01:15.430> in<00:01:15.520> that<00:01:15.610> way<00:01:15.670> it<00:01:15.940> makes<00:01:15.970> the

00:01:16.230 --> 00:01:16.240 
commands and so in that way it makes the

00:01:16.240 --> 00:01:17.430 
commands and so in that way it makes the
game<00:01:16.360> much<00:01:16.539> aren't<00:01:16.869> too<00:01:16.990> different<00:01:17.170> much<00:01:17.410> more

00:01:17.430 --> 00:01:17.440 
game much aren't too different much more

00:01:17.440 --> 00:01:24.749 
game much aren't too different much more
easy<00:01:17.800> to<00:01:18.009> play<00:01:22.890> yeah<00:01:23.890> we've<00:01:24.130> always<00:01:24.310> kind<00:01:24.670> of
