 doctor once again is personal and good 

00:00:12.150 --> 00:00:18.390
 I wanted to make this niche that 

00:00:15.269 --> 00:00:20.100
 before I start the race to speak 

00:00:18.390 --> 00:00:22.769

00:00:20.100 --> 00:00:25.890

00:00:22.769 --> 00:00:27.599
 I wanted to talk to you here. You are. 

00:00:25.890 --> 00:00:30.660

00:00:27.599 --> 00:00:32.640

00:00:30.660 --> 00:00:35.280

00:00:32.640 --> 00:00:36.989
 evaluation of you are better and better 

00:00:35.280 --> 00:00:38.790
 I also wanted to say that I am 

00:00:36.989 --> 00:00:41.250
 enjoying a lot of people making the videos 

00:00:38.790 --> 00:00:44.030
 to edit do these things all 

00:00:41.250 --> 00:00:46.559

00:00:56.850 --> 00:01:02.609
 subscribed and this is a surreal thing 

00:01:00.030 --> 00:01:04.920

00:01:02.609 --> 00:01:07.860

 pirates who are always giving me strength 

00:01:12.030 --> 00:01:16.590
 and always calling me to record these 

00:01:14.220 --> 00:01:20.159
 guys are awesome and good 

00:01:16.590 --> 00:01:23.880
 I also wanted to mention that the channel 

00:01:20.159 --> 00:01:25.770
 will undergo some reforms but more 

00:01:23.880 --> 00:01:28.860
 It's going to continue almost the same. 

00:01:25.770 --> 00:01:30.840
 I wanted to say that from tomorrow I'm going 

00:01:28.860 --> 00:01:35.119

00:01:30.840 --> 00:01:35.119

 I'll ask him a lot and we'll see. 

00:02:24.299 --> 00:02:30.959
 if he accepts and then people are just that 

00:02:28.200 --> 00:02:32.670
 I think I've already told you what I 

00:02:30.959 --> 00:02:34.170
 I had to talk if I see if 

00:02:32.670 --> 00:02:35.099
 Someone asked me for a fund there. 

00:02:34.170 --> 00:02:37.769

00:02:48.390 --> 00:02:52.200
 I was happy today 

00:02:50.280 --> 00:02:58.019
 now until the custom car bruno 

00:02:52.200 --> 00:03:00.780

00:02:58.019 --> 00:03:06.420
 did nothing have no more price rises 

00:03:00.780 --> 00:03:11.430
 busy there is the alleged now is much 

00:03:06.420 --> 00:03:13.530
 link recording crashed 

00:03:11.430 --> 00:03:16.290
 yet still I can pass a 

00:03:13.530 --> 00:03:20.459
 shame for the community of you attacks the 

00:03:16.290 --> 00:03:23.579
 lack of goals touch you improving all 

00:03:20.459 --> 00:03:25.769

 oh my God, it's really slow 

00:03:45.870 --> 00:03:53.549
 shame the guy was saying that the 

00:03:51.299 --> 00:04:03.629
 spoiler helps the car is serious 

00:03:53.549 --> 00:04:04.349
 I think I do not think it will wash the 

00:04:03.629 --> 00:04:09.930
 stops 

00:04:04.349 --> 00:04:13.169
 It's true that I saw it speaking that it helped 

00:04:09.930 --> 00:04:19.940
 to stabilize the car is not in theory gives 

00:04:13.169 --> 00:04:19.940
 more stability to that of three 

00:04:21.019 --> 00:04:29.410
 pluck out of sly 

00:04:22.810 --> 00:04:32.440
 oh my God, let's do what you should 

00:04:29.410 --> 00:04:36.580
 put a plate of almost as if 

00:04:32.440 --> 00:04:39.790

00:04:36.580 --> 00:04:49.440

00:04:39.790 --> 00:04:49.440

00:04:59.380 --> 00:05:18.040
 Did you like this note? 

00:05:03.669 --> 00:05:37.120

00:05:18.040 --> 00:05:40.650
 possible or the squid're're ready have 

00:05:37.120 --> 00:05:44.830

00:05:51.039 --> 00:06:00.820

00:05:54.789 --> 00:06:03.940

00:06:00.820 --> 00:06:05.560
 the current clear epoch leaving container is 

00:06:03.940 --> 00:06:08.380

00:06:05.560 --> 00:06:11.520
