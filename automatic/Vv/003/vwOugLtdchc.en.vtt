because it randomizes itself every
single<00:02:18.820> time<00:02:19.030> so<00:02:19.900> basically<00:02:20.380> what<00:02:20.680> you<00:02:20.800> want

00:02:20.880 --> 00:02:20.890 
single time so basically what you want

00:02:20.890 --> 00:02:22.380 
single time so basically what you want
to<00:02:21.010> do<00:02:21.190> is<00:02:21.400> you<00:02:21.430> want<00:02:21.550> to<00:02:21.760> take<00:02:21.940> all<00:02:22.240> these

00:02:22.380 --> 00:02:22.390 
to do is you want to take all these

00:02:22.390 --> 00:02:26.490 
to do is you want to take all these
crystal<00:02:22.990> balls<00:02:23.230> and<00:02:24.090> then<00:02:25.090> well<00:02:25.780> I'll<00:02:26.050> speed

00:02:26.490 --> 00:02:26.500 
crystal balls and then well I'll speed

00:02:26.500 --> 00:02:28.650 
crystal balls and then well I'll speed
this<00:02:26.680> puzzle<00:02:27.160> up<00:02:27.310> because<00:02:27.670> I'll<00:02:27.970> be<00:02:28.000> here<00:02:28.420> for

00:02:28.650 --> 00:02:28.660 
this puzzle up because I'll be here for

00:02:28.660 --> 00:02:30.480 
this puzzle up because I'll be here for
a<00:02:28.690> while<00:02:28.870> because<00:02:29.200> this<00:02:29.740> is<00:02:29.890> just<00:02:30.100> a<00:02:30.220> basic

00:02:30.480 --> 00:02:30.490 
a while because this is just a basic

00:02:30.490 --> 00:02:34.260 
a while because this is just a basic
just<00:02:30.910> a<00:02:31.000> guess<00:02:31.270> and<00:02:31.450> check<00:02:31.510> game<00:02:32.020> for<00:02:32.230> me<00:02:32.380> um<00:02:33.270> so

00:02:34.260 --> 00:02:34.270 
just a guess and check game for me um so

00:02:34.270 --> 00:02:38.340 
just a guess and check game for me um so
yeah<00:02:35.070> if<00:02:36.070> any<00:02:36.280> of<00:02:36.370> you<00:02:36.640> have<00:02:37.090> a<00:02:37.600> solution<00:02:38.020> to

00:02:38.340 --> 00:02:38.350 
yeah if any of you have a solution to

00:02:38.350 --> 00:02:40.920 
yeah if any of you have a solution to
the<00:02:38.440> puzzle<00:02:38.670> even<00:02:39.670> when<00:02:39.790> I<00:02:39.820> looked<00:02:40.180> it<00:02:40.390> up<00:02:40.510> it

00:02:40.920 --> 00:02:40.930 
the puzzle even when I looked it up it

00:02:40.930 --> 00:02:42.780 
the puzzle even when I looked it up it
didn't<00:02:41.290> make<00:02:41.410> any<00:02:41.440> sense<00:02:41.620> to<00:02:41.950> me<00:02:42.070> so<00:02:42.700> if

00:02:42.780 --> 00:02:42.790 
didn't make any sense to me so if

00:02:42.790 --> 00:02:45.060 
didn't make any sense to me so if
anybody<00:02:43.150> can<00:02:43.330> make<00:02:43.570> it<00:02:43.750> make<00:02:43.930> sense<00:02:44.070> there's

00:02:45.060 --> 00:02:45.070 
anybody can make it make sense there's

00:02:45.070 --> 00:02:46.560 
anybody can make it make sense there's
some<00:02:45.310> mind<00:02:45.550> rounds<00:02:45.850> right<00:02:45.970> there<00:02:46.209> which<00:02:46.420> I

00:02:46.560 --> 00:02:46.570 
some mind rounds right there which I

00:02:46.570 --> 00:02:49.680 
some mind rounds right there which I
don't<00:02:46.630> want<00:02:47.670> put<00:02:48.670> it<00:02:48.760> in<00:02:48.850> the<00:02:48.970> description<00:02:49.060> and

speeding<00:02:56.830> up<00:02:56.890> process<00:02:57.370> so<00:02:57.490> basically<00:02:57.910> there's

00:02:58.350 --> 00:02:58.360 
speeding up process so basically there's

00:02:58.360 --> 00:03:00.390 
speeding up process so basically there's
three<00:02:58.810> pictures<00:02:59.260> here<00:02:59.470> with<00:02:59.709> a<00:02:59.740> little<00:03:00.130> tray

00:03:00.390 --> 00:03:00.400 
three pictures here with a little tray

00:03:00.400 --> 00:03:03.810 
three pictures here with a little tray
underneath<00:03:00.730> and<00:03:01.570> you<00:03:01.720> want<00:03:02.080> to<00:03:02.520> order<00:03:03.520> the
