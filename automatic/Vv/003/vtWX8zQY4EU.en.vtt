00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:07.279
 Would have come movies mail to e guy 28 days 

00:00:04.950 --> 00:00:07.279
 A little 

00:00:08.010 --> 00:00:17.060
 28 you should see now 

00:00:12.660 --> 00:00:19.810
 Once failed to rescue Maki Koyose, it's here now 

00:00:17.060 --> 00:00:23.050
 It was a good thing. 

00:00:19.810 --> 00:00:26.609
 It was part of the plan to fail once 

00:00:23.050 --> 00:00:26.609
 Uncle to see it 

00:00:27.800 --> 00:00:32.710
 Was 

00:00:32.800 --> 00:00:37.710
 Nice to meet only 

00:00:34.410 --> 00:00:39.800
 Of my 15 years ago department Paryi 

00:00:37.710 --> 00:00:39.800
 The 

00:00:40.040 --> 00:00:47.000
 Words that say open this email 

00:00:43.040 --> 00:00:54.329
 It looks that failed to save Chris 

00:00:47.000 --> 00:00:55.410
 It was crazy, but the real pain gave me an anniversary 

00:00:54.329 --> 00:00:58.560
 So 

00:00:55.410 --> 00:00:59.730
 It did not afford to particular there was no 

00:00:58.560 --> 00:01:02.620
 now 

00:00:59.730 --> 00:01:06.520
 It's like a preparation 

00:01:02.620 --> 00:01:11.200
 Now you can finally get into the planning problem 

00:01:06.520 --> 00:01:13.050
 It plans to enter the Makise Kurisu save us Steins gate 

00:01:11.200 --> 00:01:15.450
 Two conditions 

00:01:13.050 --> 00:01:18.100
 Dr. M. brought to Russia 

00:01:15.450 --> 00:01:21.450
 A dissertation on the god of time 

00:01:18.100 --> 00:01:25.150
 Burying away from this world 

00:01:21.450 --> 00:01:27.409
 The other is to save Komise Makise 

00:01:25.150 --> 00:01:31.790
 I hope I can do it 

00:01:27.409 --> 00:01:34.650
 To avoid the death of Makise Kurisu is to alter the past 

00:01:31.790 --> 00:01:36.260
 Impossible due to the convergence of the adjector fielder 

00:01:34.650 --> 00:01:39.830
 stop for a 

00:01:36.260 --> 00:01:43.460
 It is possible to make turkey Lee Chris 

00:01:39.830 --> 00:01:45.610
 It's just the wrong way 

00:01:43.460 --> 00:01:48.210
 Listen well 

00:01:45.610 --> 00:01:52.900
 Do not change the fixed past 

00:01:48.210 --> 00:01:56.200
 Don't let the first unconfident have never seen 

00:01:52.900 --> 00:01:59.170
 If you do not do something happens past changes occur 

00:01:56.200 --> 00:02:02.800
 Everything is lost 

00:01:59.170 --> 00:02:05.950
 Whether you are there do remember that you have experience in the World Championship 

00:02:02.800 --> 00:02:09.649
 If you only have 3 weeks 

00:02:05.950 --> 00:02:15.230
 There should be a memory I remembered 

00:02:09.649 --> 00:02:19.870
 To Moyo sacrifice of many for applying Mayuri with Chris 

00:02:15.230 --> 00:02:19.870
 There should be an experience of continuing to wander 

00:02:20.150 --> 00:02:29.130
 Do n't waste your 3 weeks of world war drifting 

00:02:26.270 --> 00:02:32.310
 Don't make it happen 

00:02:29.130 --> 00:02:36.660
 It is because I traveled a number of worldly 

00:02:32.310 --> 00:02:41.400
 You're in there you want to help Chris 

00:02:36.660 --> 00:02:46.860
 I am here who dedicated everything to time machine development 

00:02:41.400 --> 00:02:48.990
 Precisely because us is the place where you are standing there has been a eye want to help Chris 

00:02:46.860 --> 00:02:53.790
 It's a place I could reach 

00:02:48.990 --> 00:02:57.600
 Shrank you ze ball because 

00:02:53.790 --> 00:03:02.350
 Say that Chris is dead or save her before publishing 

00:02:57.600 --> 00:03:06.360
 Let me observe that I am confident in writing a living clip 

00:03:02.350 --> 00:03:10.830
 If the elephant is past change is big 

00:03:06.360 --> 00:03:12.910
 So does that mean occur seen you 

00:03:10.830 --> 00:03:15.330
 You should understand if you 

00:03:12.910 --> 00:03:17.680
 By the way, the format of the time machine is 

00:03:15.330 --> 00:03:22.240
 c 2 / Marion is 

00:03:17.680 --> 00:03:23.520
 It goes without saying what the initials mean 

00:03:22.240 --> 00:03:25.980
 We are 

00:03:23.520 --> 00:03:29.330
 And the world manufacturing method of purpose 

00:03:25.980 --> 00:03:31.120
 It is me that I named it Steinsgate 

00:03:29.330 --> 00:03:34.220
 Why is that? 

00:03:31.120 --> 00:03:37.720
 You should understand if you 

00:03:34.220 --> 00:03:37.720
 There is no sense in commons 

00:03:41.030 --> 00:03:46.330
 Mid mission from this 

00:03:43.380 --> 00:03:50.340
 Explain what operations school says 

00:03:46.330 --> 00:03:53.170
 Kaero the results without changing the confirmed corner 

00:03:50.340 --> 00:03:56.050
 And to have Makise Kurisu collapse in bloody 

00:03:53.170 --> 00:04:00.300
 Ota Rintaro who saw it 

00:03:56.050 --> 00:04:02.860
 Change the result to improve its finalized corner 

00:04:00.300 --> 00:04:05.970
 Thin your first 

00:04:02.860 --> 00:04:05.970
 Let me go 

00:04:06.630 --> 00:04:10.760
 It is a condition to reach the soybean gate 

00:04:11.640 --> 00:04:15.860
 I think it's a dog 

00:04:14.470 --> 00:04:18.850
 Practical 

00:04:15.860 --> 00:04:18.850
 Child who works hard 

00:04:19.200 --> 00:04:21.200
 Hmm 

00:04:21.310 --> 00:04:27.490
 Hey whether the dog that after 15 years 

00:04:24.440 --> 00:04:30.840
 For example I think was Shibuka' 

00:04:27.490 --> 00:04:30.840
 good was Settsu' 

00:04:31.070 --> 00:04:39.550
 amaran 

00:04:33.190 --> 00:04:43.860
 It ends and El Pusaikonguruu to put the Nation Te Poe say hand 

00:04:39.550 --> 00:04:43.860
 What are you doing but I also became 33 

00:04:44.550 --> 00:04:48.860
 It is born, and it may not be fully opened 

00:04:53.969 --> 00:05:00.610
 The gate is also mana 

00:04:57.150 --> 00:05:06.960
 I'm a crazy mad port test 

00:05:00.610 --> 00:05:06.960
 Features of the cocoon, such as fool our hospital Kyoshin world 

00:05:08.790 --> 00:05:13.409
 Hmmm 

00:05:09.950 --> 00:05:17.429
 Back to pick up to 5 minutes or there was you 

00:05:13.409 --> 00:05:19.830
 Mayu likes this temporary person 

00:05:17.429 --> 00:05:22.060
 See you again 

00:05:19.830 --> 00:05:25.449
 Kanure is a 

00:05:22.060 --> 00:05:28.560
 Mad Mad Scientist 

00:05:25.449 --> 00:05:28.560
 There are many 

00:05:29.930 --> 00:05:35.259
 The world got a in the my-energized
