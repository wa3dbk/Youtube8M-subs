00:00:06.620 --> 00:00:10.000
 At the end of this session we will gather people who could not introduce you 

00:00:10.849 --> 00:00:12.759
 First of all crawl 

00:00:12.759 --> 00:00:16.510
 On the left side of the body breath pointed out that both hands were spread around bul 

00:00:17.079 --> 00:00:20.079
 I will make up Kikuma 

00:00:22.689 --> 00:00:26.220
 Put a force on the right hand and do not step on the ball together 

00:00:26.220 --> 00:00:28.009
 There is 

00:00:28.009 --> 00:00:31.369
 If you put the effort well, you will get the spin while doing this trick 

00:00:31.369 --> 00:00:34.369
 Can also 

00:00:38.110 --> 00:00:39.350
 Umbrella 

00:00:39.350 --> 00:00:42.520
 Ando and the area that I got right from the left came to the right 

00:00:42.520 --> 00:00:45.910
 When 

00:00:45.910 --> 00:00:48.910
 I will pull back again when it comes to the left 

00:00:50.050 --> 00:00:53.050
 We repeat to liquor 6 meeting place 

00:00:53.800 --> 00:00:56.800
 Next, the trajectory of the ball draws the shape of depth 

00:01:02.540 --> 00:01:05.890
 Cooling talk that lightly thrown wood lands from rag top 

00:01:07.410 --> 00:01:10.550
 After landing, I'm lightly throwing up my life on the cross 

00:01:10.550 --> 00:01:13.690
 Allow cross in 

00:01:13.690 --> 00:01:16.450
 Another one that repeats the capture continuously in the left and right 

00:01:16.450 --> 00:01:18.630
 It is rumored 

00:01:18.630 --> 00:01:21.630
 Dynamically ask the body left and right 

00:01:25.850 --> 00:01:28.850
 What happens when you are capturing people or running on the road 

00:01:29.870 --> 00:01:32.870
 In addition it is adopted continuously 

00:01:33.820 --> 00:01:36.770
 Do the same thing behind my back 

00:01:36.770 --> 00:01:39.910
 Harada would like to see it around half past 8 

00:01:39.910 --> 00:01:41.130
 To do 

00:01:41.130 --> 00:01:44.130
 It is a very difficult skill 

00:01:46.830 --> 00:01:50.180
 No, I told that the strings jumped around me 

00:01:50.180 --> 00:01:53.180
 Chinese acrobat performers often use 

00:01:53.980 --> 00:01:55.070
 From before 

00:01:55.070 --> 00:01:56.210
 From the back 

00:01:56.210 --> 00:01:59.310
 And there are various variations such as 20 o'clock 

00:02:01.770 --> 00:02:05.780
 Hanging the cord to the neck and offering the most powerful person 

00:02:05.780 --> 00:02:07.850
 I'm looking to 

00:02:07.850 --> 00:02:10.850
 It is a mek trampoline 

00:02:14.499 --> 00:02:17.829
 Bounce to support the ground 

00:02:17.829 --> 00:02:19.619
 Left-handed person left 2 

00:02:19.619 --> 00:02:22.799
 The third day says to the right 

00:02:22.799 --> 00:02:25.799
 No, I will fail to throw a full throw to Tomoko Kuroda 

00:02:27.109 --> 00:02:30.599
 Play with Japan's Reaction Force when connecting it 

00:02:30.599 --> 00:02:32.289
 Overturn such common sense 

00:02:32.289 --> 00:02:35.289
 New mind is closed string 

00:02:36.179 --> 00:02:39.839
 Beautiful movements unique to both have been tried several times 

00:02:43.469 --> 00:02:46.339
 Specific turn 

00:02:46.339 --> 00:02:49.339
 And around the feet 

00:02:52.429 --> 00:02:55.359
 The application of the normal one is also possible 

00:02:55.359 --> 00:02:58.359
 New season next year 

00:02:58.859 --> 00:03:01.859
 Many people do not have names 

00:03:06.309 --> 00:03:09.309
 One Gear Brewers Here One Break 

00:03:10.139 --> 00:03:12.319
 I will give you one roll from the next
