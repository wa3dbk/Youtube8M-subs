been used and it really came out nice

00:04:13.700 --> 00:04:16.969 
been used and it really came out nice
this<00:04:14.700> one<00:04:15.389> looking<00:04:15.930> back<00:04:16.079> at<00:04:16.349> it<00:04:16.500> I<00:04:16.650> didn't

00:04:16.969 --> 00:04:16.979 
this one looking back at it I didn't

00:04:16.979 --> 00:04:19.780

00:04:25.180 --> 00:04:25.190

towards<00:04:44.060> the<00:04:44.240> mid<00:04:44.450> and<00:04:44.600> a<00:04:45.350> pioneer<00:04:45.830> will

00:04:46.030 --> 00:04:46.040 
towards the mid and a pioneer will

00:04:46.040 --> 00:04:47.950 
towards the mid and a pioneer will
actually<00:04:46.400> come<00:04:46.670> up<00:04:46.700> a<00:04:46.910> little<00:04:47.000> higher<00:04:47.150> so<00:04:47.690> you

00:04:47.950 --> 00:04:47.960
