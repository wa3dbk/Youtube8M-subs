00:00:00.620 --> 00:00:05.580
 Hello dear friends with you I am 

00:00:03.330 --> 00:00:06.240
 would increase lighting and transmission to 

00:00:05.580 --> 00:00:08.700
 to buy 

00:00:06.240 --> 00:00:11.580
 Today video we talk about the least 

00:00:08.700 --> 00:00:15.030
 prem fr known sauna seventh level and 

00:00:11.580 --> 00:00:17.279
 about t15 and let me remind everyone that 

00:00:15.030 --> 00:00:19.080
 This video I do not talk about every tth 

00:00:17.279 --> 00:00:21.960
 selected tank first 

00:00:19.080 --> 00:00:24.420
 talking about who he likes 

00:00:21.960 --> 00:00:29.330
 what is it made for, how much does it make and 

00:00:24.420 --> 00:00:29.330
 how is it better to play and so go 

00:00:37.580 --> 00:00:42.060
 British at-15 and dramatically 

00:00:40.350 --> 00:00:44.790
 different from other premium 

00:00:42.060 --> 00:00:47.610
 classmates we have crazy frontal 

00:00:44.790 --> 00:00:48.630
 booking at 228 six-tenths 

00:00:47.610 --> 00:00:50.820
 millimeters of armor 

00:00:48.630 --> 00:00:53.010
 although such thickness is observed they are everywhere 

00:00:50.820 --> 00:00:55.980
 for example on the side bulge them 

00:00:53.010 --> 00:00:57.660
 the thickness is only 152 millimeters but 

00:00:55.980 --> 00:00:59.910
 because not everyone knows what to shoot 

00:00:57.660 --> 00:01:02.430
 it is necessary in them and pt itself is not 

00:00:59.910 --> 00:01:04.830
 have too popular chances of rebounding and 

00:01:02.430 --> 00:01:06.960
 non-survival will be very high 

00:01:04.830 --> 00:01:09.630
 the main thing is not to give the enemy to go to 

00:01:06.960 --> 00:01:11.790
 you in the side and aft although even there protection 

00:01:09.630 --> 00:01:14.430
 far from being comic because of such 

00:01:11.790 --> 00:01:16.110
 huge amount of iron is very strong 

00:01:14.430 --> 00:01:18.450
 suffered our maximum speed 

00:01:16.110 --> 00:01:21.450
 movement of 20 kilometers per hour 

00:01:18.450 --> 00:01:23.250
 make us into a real bug 

00:01:21.450 --> 00:01:26.160
 and as for the instrument, it’s not 

00:01:23.250 --> 00:01:28.830
 everything is so unique we have huge angles 

00:01:26.160 --> 00:01:29.759
 horizontal pickup at 25 degrees 

00:01:28.830 --> 00:01:32.610
 each side 

00:01:29.759 --> 00:01:34.500
 but the damage we have is a penny plus minus 150 

00:01:32.610 --> 00:01:37.229
 units per shot blessing saves 

00:01:34.500 --> 00:01:39.630
 firing rate of almost 14 shots at 

00:01:37.229 --> 00:01:41.520
 a minute which is not so bad after all 

00:01:39.630 --> 00:01:43.950
 we got a very decent under 

00:01:41.520 --> 00:01:46.350
 osago which is capable of much if 

00:01:43.950 --> 00:01:48.360
 god of randomness will be on your side either 

00:01:46.350 --> 00:01:50.759
 at least sovzvvodnikov tory able you 

00:01:48.360 --> 00:01:53.069
 cover up in battle personally I was always behind 

00:01:50.759 --> 00:01:55.229
 heavier counterparts and tried not 

00:01:53.069 --> 00:01:56.849
 linger in places where my board 

00:01:55.229 --> 00:01:59.399
 was becoming too affordable for 

00:01:56.849 --> 00:02:01.619
 enemy guns in the first battle which 

00:01:59.399 --> 00:02:04.830
 I did in order to refresh my memories from 

00:02:01.619 --> 00:02:08.160
 This signed I dealt 3,600 denis damage 

00:02:04.830 --> 00:02:10.830
 made four frags tankanul 1700 damages 

00:02:08.160 --> 00:02:13.050
 took the master and other medals by itself 

00:02:10.830 --> 00:02:14.940
 so not always lucky but almost big 

00:02:13.050 --> 00:02:17.580
 some battles were very successful 

00:02:14.940 --> 00:02:20.580
 failures were only when the Allied team 

00:02:17.580 --> 00:02:23.040
 merged all and incomprehensible where ever when 

00:02:20.580 --> 00:02:25.020
 I started to believe in myself too on it 

00:02:23.040 --> 00:02:26.849
 you can play from the first line 

00:02:25.020 --> 00:02:27.840
 so that your speed allows you 

00:02:26.849 --> 00:02:29.730
 get to her 

00:02:27.840 --> 00:02:32.040
 but on the second line she will be herself 

00:02:29.730 --> 00:02:34.410
 nice to feel thanks to a great 

00:02:32.040 --> 00:02:36.270
 accuracy the main disadvantage of this 

00:02:34.410 --> 00:02:38.790
 Tank is not issued 

00:02:36.270 --> 00:02:40.830
 all armor penetration of his cannon 170 

00:02:38.790 --> 00:02:43.560
 millimeters base projectile for 

00:02:40.830 --> 00:02:45.690
 classmates that enough but here 

00:02:43.560 --> 00:02:47.700
 against the eighth level you are clearly worth 

00:02:45.690 --> 00:02:52.080
 carry a decent stock of gold 

00:02:47.700 --> 00:02:54.570
 projectile among other things is a tank 

00:02:52.080 --> 00:02:57.000
 has a preferential level of fights and higher than 

00:02:54.570 --> 00:02:58.980
 8th level you will not throw this aspect 

00:02:57.000 --> 00:03:01.980
 I advise to consider when playing with friends 

00:02:58.980 --> 00:03:05.760
 in platoon since level nine you 

00:03:01.980 --> 00:03:09.120
 nothing to oppose as for 

00:03:05.760 --> 00:03:10.830
 format for the average battle you get 45-60 

00:03:09.120 --> 00:03:13.650
 thousand silver with active 

00:03:10.830 --> 00:03:14.670
 prem account as you understand the tank is not 

00:03:13.650 --> 00:03:17.130
 absolutely for pharma 

00:03:14.670 --> 00:03:19.590
 although lbz I performed on it with a good 

00:03:17.130 --> 00:03:21.570
 speed he is more created to play with 

00:03:19.590 --> 00:03:23.250
 friends receiving a file when 

00:03:21.570 --> 00:03:25.320
 pushing lines or vice versa 

00:03:23.250 --> 00:03:28.220
 contain a large number 

00:03:25.320 --> 00:03:31.500
 opponents with their mighty armor 

00:03:28.220 --> 00:03:33.780
 worth buying a tank or not your business 

00:03:31.500 --> 00:03:35.990
 but if you already have a rich tank 

00:03:33.780 --> 00:03:38.430
 the park of direct technology that this tank will be 

00:03:35.990 --> 00:03:40.650
 a great addition to the collection 

00:03:38.430 --> 00:03:43.230
 and if you have no tanks at all 

00:03:40.650 --> 00:03:43.890
 at15 begins but still I don’t 

00:03:43.230 --> 00:03:47.280
 I advise 

00:03:43.890 --> 00:03:49.590
 and today I had everything with you 

00:03:47.280 --> 00:03:51.780
 Yaroslav the lighting and transmission to 

00:03:49.590 --> 00:03:53.970
 buy the owner of this tank I 

00:03:51.780 --> 00:03:55.440
 I suggest to write my reviews from the game 

00:03:53.970 --> 00:03:57.540
 on it below in the comments 

00:03:55.440 --> 00:03:59.580
 sure many will be interested in them 

00:03:57.540 --> 00:04:01.680
 read also put fingers up 

00:03:59.580 --> 00:04:03.540
 subscribe to the channel be funky and on 

00:04:01.680 --> 00:04:06.450
