00:00:00.199 --> 00:00:02.220
 in Tomsk from Wednesday what year can begin 

00:00:02.220 --> 00:00:04.629
 lay new type of asphalt on urban 

00:00:04.629 --> 00:00:06.470
 the streets may appear rubble 

00:00:06.470 --> 00:00:08.519
 mastic asphalt concrete denis 

00:00:08.519 --> 00:00:09.879
 soldierina road experiment 

00:00:09.879 --> 00:00:12.149
 city ​​authorities 

00:00:12.149 --> 00:00:14.099
 while in the city there is a repair campaign 

00:00:14.099 --> 00:00:16.199
 this year the city authorities are already thinking about 

00:00:16.199 --> 00:00:18.239
 volume what changes to make road 

00:00:18.239 --> 00:00:19.730
 work for a knowledgeable year 

00:00:19.730 --> 00:00:21.699
 so mayor of tomsk ivan klein after his 

00:00:21.699 --> 00:00:23.520
 trips to Tyumen Krasnoyarsk 

00:00:23.520 --> 00:00:25.170
 offers to lay in Tomsk 

00:00:25.170 --> 00:00:28.280
 we smile and shemai this is rubbly mastic 

00:00:28.279 --> 00:00:30.480
 asphalt its advantage is 

00:00:30.480 --> 00:00:32.050
 that it is more durable 

00:00:32.050 --> 00:00:33.960
 This is achieved due to the fact that 

00:00:33.960 --> 00:00:36.460
 larger crushed stones are used and 

00:00:36.460 --> 00:00:39.420
 special air additives are fed bills 

00:00:39.420 --> 00:00:40.940
 for heating nato 

00:00:40.940 --> 00:00:44.240
 fork out the material hot 534 

00:00:44.240 --> 00:00:45.400
 thousands of places 

00:00:45.400 --> 00:00:47.550
 however as to whether it stabilizes 

00:00:47.550 --> 00:00:49.610
 keep children 

00:00:49.610 --> 00:00:52.230
 hold concrete rubble 

00:00:52.230 --> 00:00:54.520
 the meaning of it then this supplement otherwise he 

00:00:54.520 --> 00:00:56.590
 just a steppe exists and there 

00:00:56.590 --> 00:00:58.900
 more than 5 minutes and will not 

00:00:58.900 --> 00:01:00.200
 just black 

00:01:00.200 --> 00:01:02.080
 and today Tomsk when the head is like 

00:01:02.080 --> 00:01:03.110
 since I went to several 

00:01:03.110 --> 00:01:05.850
 enterprises that produce crushed stone 

00:01:05.850 --> 00:01:07.719
 mastic asphalt concrete 

00:01:07.719 --> 00:01:09.539
 to see if they can personally 

00:01:09.539 --> 00:01:11.999
 provide road work for the next 

00:01:11.999 --> 00:01:14.209
 year woe now these factories produce 

00:01:14.209 --> 00:01:16.369
 slam so here's the case for small 

00:01:16.369 --> 00:01:19.379
 conclude contracts now preparing 

00:01:19.379 --> 00:01:21.290
 percent 

00:01:21.290 --> 00:01:22.760
 by acting in society all 

00:01:22.760 --> 00:01:25.100
 turning prepare a work plan next 

00:01:25.100 --> 00:01:26.800
 year along these streets which 

00:01:26.800 --> 00:01:28.820
 the percentage will be repaired and 

00:01:28.820 --> 00:01:30.710
 we will certainly prepare proposals 

00:01:30.710 --> 00:01:33.740
 no exception 

00:01:33.740 --> 00:01:36.870
 and a little more 

00:01:36.870 --> 00:01:39.140
 jury control plan silichi control will 

00:01:39.140 --> 00:01:41.040
 so while sleeping will be stacked by 

00:01:41.040 --> 00:01:42.920
 previous technology however to the next 

00:01:42.920 --> 00:01:44.100
 year the mayor instructed 

00:01:44.100 --> 00:01:45.830
 the question is what to consider 

00:01:45.830 --> 00:01:47.939
 More so for example is very important 

00:01:47.939 --> 00:01:50.369
 understand whether it can pull the city 

00:01:50.369 --> 00:01:52.830
 the budget because laying this type of asphalt 

00:01:52.830 --> 00:01:55.470
 cost 12 to 15 percent more expensive 

00:01:55.470 --> 00:01:58.110
 however he will serve 

00:01:58.110 --> 00:02:00.020
 and not soldiers vladislav kochetov
