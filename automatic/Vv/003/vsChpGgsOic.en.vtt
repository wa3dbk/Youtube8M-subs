00:00:06.759 --> 00:00:11.519
 preparing thoroughly a very party 

00:00:09.370 --> 00:00:11.519
 important 

00:00:15.960 --> 00:00:21.210
 but all this will only be valid 

00:00:21.240 --> 00:00:30.180
 if we win and if we do not win it seems that 

00:00:25.510 --> 00:00:34.559
 we have prepared and we have not worked 

00:00:30.180 --> 00:00:38.440
 so that the player untrained 

00:00:34.559 --> 00:00:39.609
 We have worked badly and it is a pleasure but 

00:00:38.440 --> 00:00:41.769
 I am satisfied 

00:00:39.609 --> 00:00:45.870
 Aniston jumped up from the reaction of 

00:00:41.769 --> 00:00:45.870
 the players already caesar analytical 

00:00:46.150 --> 00:00:53.910
 before a match as hard as the one in 

00:00:50.080 --> 00:00:53.910
 legal vote 

00:00:55.730 --> 00:01:04.129
 every day that passes almost with the trini to 

00:00:58.780 --> 00:01:09.550
 this coach is more suited to the 

00:01:04.129 --> 00:01:09.550
 players and the entity 

00:01:10.030 --> 00:01:17.180
 we have three league games the night 

00:01:12.979 --> 00:01:18.350
 it shines and we're still adjusting and that 

00:01:17.180 --> 00:01:21.470
 got a shock but if the visually 

00:01:18.350 --> 00:01:24.020
 or even everyone needs is that 

00:01:21.470 --> 00:01:26.450
 because good a period since I that is 

00:01:24.020 --> 00:01:28.850
 that your we are in that process all and 

00:01:26.450 --> 00:01:30.590
 this section manchegas one of them but 

00:01:28.850 --> 00:01:34.030
 what I believe for that 

00:01:30.590 --> 00:01:34.030
 ghassan is that we are growing 

00:01:43.450 --> 00:01:51.170
 and above all they do not reach part of the 

00:01:49.490 --> 00:01:53.460
 long-term injured and now 

00:01:51.170 --> 00:01:57.540
 same 

00:01:53.460 --> 00:02:00.840
 it's a condition of thing on cell phone with 

00:01:57.540 --> 00:02:02.640
 the work that take lessons a little 

00:02:00.840 --> 00:02:07.560
 more important this service 

00:02:02.640 --> 00:02:10.130
 lockers for the bruise of goal is 

00:02:07.560 --> 00:02:10.130
 in conditions 

00:02:12.720 --> 00:02:19.790
 and it is not yesterday was not in the 

00:02:15.810 --> 00:02:19.790
 training for a family theme 

00:02:20.270 --> 00:02:29.300
 veloso track goal 

00:02:25.110 --> 00:02:29.300
 have a knee problem 

00:02:30.080 --> 00:02:36.750
 that still its stability in our 

00:02:33.450 --> 00:02:39.150
 life this moment is not the desired one nor is it 

00:02:36.750 --> 00:02:41.730
 seven nights at the insurance box office 

00:02:39.150 --> 00:02:44.060
 thanks the question of when for 

00:02:41.730 --> 00:02:44.060
 tango 

00:02:44.310 --> 00:02:51.300
 I do not know when and something that takes me away but 

00:02:47.790 --> 00:02:53.750
 I just want that when I go back to that 

00:02:51.300 --> 00:02:53.750
 come well 

00:03:03.200 --> 00:03:14.280
 with doubt to the players 

00:03:11.190 --> 00:03:16.950
 I have forbidden them is to look at the 

00:03:14.280 --> 00:03:18.540
 sort that house into potholes no longer 

00:03:16.950 --> 00:03:21.799
 is fought is classification of 

00:03:18.540 --> 00:03:25.470
 collectors that is no longer useful 

00:03:21.799 --> 00:03:29.819
 only serves as a foundation guys that we 

00:03:25.470 --> 00:03:33.930
 let's go inside and that the year will be 

00:03:29.819 --> 00:03:38.130
 hard and that the objective that we have clear 

00:03:33.930 --> 00:03:42.510
 all more in the long term we have it 

00:03:38.130 --> 00:03:44.959
 Of course we do not just have to think about 

00:03:42.510 --> 00:03:44.959
 one thing 

00:03:47.120 --> 00:03:56.190
 let's not think about anything else 

00:03:50.910 --> 00:03:59.510
 The football player has the obligation to 

00:03:56.190 --> 00:03:59.510
 know what you have to do 

00:03:59.960 --> 00:04:11.160
 him alone with issam and then lend a hand 

00:04:05.040 --> 00:04:16.130
 to the partner and the group responsibility 

00:04:11.160 --> 00:04:16.130
 is mine can not fall to them 

00:04:26.540 --> 00:04:32.610
 the Economist 

00:04:30.200 --> 00:04:33.270
 it was one of the big problems of the 

00:04:32.610 --> 00:04:36.660
 Sunday 

00:04:33.270 --> 00:04:41.570
 the problem of distances then 

00:04:36.660 --> 00:04:44.250
 everything is based on the cost and policies and 

00:04:41.570 --> 00:04:47.430
 we have to be much closer together 

00:04:44.250 --> 00:04:49.590
 last 687 here I will talk about breezes 

00:04:47.430 --> 00:04:53.360
 of pisco served and we have to be more 

00:04:49.590 --> 00:04:58.789
 aggressive and would not mean that day 

00:04:53.360 --> 00:05:02.229
 much more aggressive in the crown always 

00:04:58.789 --> 00:05:07.879
 It has been characterized as a team 

00:05:02.229 --> 00:05:11.719
 aggressive with this character 

00:05:07.879 --> 00:05:14.050
 I assure you that training and in all 

00:05:11.719 --> 00:05:14.050
 chores 

00:05:17.080 --> 00:05:21.860
 I want to be twice as aggressive with the 

00:05:20.870 --> 00:05:24.500
 aggression 

00:05:21.860 --> 00:05:27.729
 the team must be very intense fights 

00:05:24.500 --> 00:05:27.729
 by a lot of insensitive impact 

00:05:27.889 --> 00:05:36.439
 and that I think we're not repeating 

00:05:29.810 --> 00:05:38.740
 and we have to run less but more 

00:05:36.439 --> 00:05:38.740
 fast 

00:05:48.279 --> 00:06:01.219
 at 40 he has to have 

00:05:56.529 --> 00:06:04.569
 we come from 16 in situation 

00:06:01.219 --> 00:06:07.669
 of vibrated goal can I also calls 

00:06:04.569 --> 00:06:10.080
 let's see neither Munich to the wind hydro 

00:06:07.669 --> 00:06:13.650
 abyss of mcv 

00:06:10.080 --> 00:06:17.280
 once I have the ax in design 

00:06:13.650 --> 00:06:20.900
 final and the technical prism class 

00:06:17.280 --> 00:06:20.900
 of 2007 

00:06:32.280 --> 00:06:35.280
 Y 

00:06:45.719 --> 00:06:49.319
 From Sofia 

00:06:51.870 --> 00:07:01.689
 to have a greater amount with which 

00:06:58.330 --> 00:07:03.759
 you want and another way brookman an element 

00:07:01.689 --> 00:07:06.550
 most intact david fragment grieving 

00:07:03.759 --> 00:07:09.219
 mister is neutral have cristina tocco 

00:07:06.550 --> 00:07:11.860
 ania and arma measure if we stick to the 

00:07:09.219 --> 00:07:14.770
 statistics is a lot and perceiving a 20 the 

00:07:11.860 --> 00:07:18.090
 statistical page scares everyone 

00:07:14.770 --> 00:07:18.090
 these extraction already 

00:07:19.090 --> 00:07:29.830
 and this does not either 

00:07:24.159 --> 00:07:33.699
 these are not going to win either 

00:07:29.830 --> 00:07:33.699
 and I think we have many possibilities 

00:07:35.940 --> 00:07:41.240
 I do not say it as hollow words members 

00:07:38.610 --> 00:07:44.090
 already in itself beautiful visual no 

00:07:41.240 --> 00:07:46.190
 I'm convinced I already know how they are doing and 

00:07:44.090 --> 00:07:48.080
 well I try to convey his sexy side almost 

00:07:46.190 --> 00:07:51.020
 corner when we analyze rivals 

00:07:48.080 --> 00:07:54.260
 arriving at the specific mission we have 

00:07:51.020 --> 00:07:57.380
 to be able to last instant 

00:07:54.260 --> 00:07:59.800
 to see that we can be better than 

00:07:57.380 --> 00:07:59.800
 anyone
