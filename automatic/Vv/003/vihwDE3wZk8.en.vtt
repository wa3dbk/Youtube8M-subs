00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.090
 get lost in minecraft lately 

00:00:01.469 --> 00:00:03.810
 It is very simple even more than 

00:00:03.090 --> 00:00:05.850
 what should 

00:00:03.810 --> 00:00:07.830
 that's why captain finally found 

00:00:05.850 --> 00:00:11.660
 land thanks to that magnificent lighthouse 

00:00:07.830 --> 00:00:11.660
 captain captain 

00:00:14.700 --> 00:00:21.700
 and what I want to suggest is that 

00:00:20.020 --> 00:00:23.590
 with a lighthouse like this so of sirte 

00:00:21.700 --> 00:00:25.270
 we can guide ourselves but we can take it 

00:00:23.590 --> 00:00:26.770
 a little further if what we want 

00:00:25.270 --> 00:00:28.210
 build for example a lighthouse we have 

00:00:26.770 --> 00:00:30.279
 have to consider two things and that is 

00:00:28.210 --> 00:00:32.320
 for example we have two types of blocks 

00:00:30.279 --> 00:00:34.390
 the block the normal and bright that this 

00:00:32.320 --> 00:00:35.860
 that always stays on and the 

00:00:34.390 --> 00:00:38.440
 new rest lamp although they added 

00:00:35.860 --> 00:00:40.809
 recently or not so recently that 

00:00:38.440 --> 00:00:43.810
 It is simple to apply current 

00:00:40.809 --> 00:00:46.540
 turn on and off but what we want 

00:00:43.810 --> 00:00:49.570
 is to build a beacon that rocks and this 

00:00:46.540 --> 00:00:51.640
 here this does not cool if this does not so what 

00:00:49.570 --> 00:00:53.440
 we removed a beacon in real life what 

00:00:51.640 --> 00:00:55.030
 does it's intermittent signal and what 

00:00:53.440 --> 00:00:56.560
 we are going to do more than the hand of recreating it 

00:00:55.030 --> 00:00:58.360
 in this way we have for example another 

00:00:56.560 --> 00:00:59.950
 type of mechanism those who do not do or we 

00:00:58.360 --> 00:01:02.500
 allow for example to make a signal 

00:00:59.950 --> 00:01:04.659
 intermittent the first would be this double 

00:01:02.500 --> 00:01:07.540
 how normal the rest over torch to 

00:01:04.659 --> 00:01:09.280
 each side 1 2 and 1 and 2 

00:01:07.540 --> 00:01:11.470
 here rest here rest and we would lack the 

00:01:09.280 --> 00:01:13.869
 rest of the medium so we get in the 

00:01:11.470 --> 00:01:16.030
 intermittent the problem of this or of 

00:01:13.869 --> 00:01:18.930
 this circuit would be that they had 

00:01:16.030 --> 00:01:20.910
 very fast intermittent and yes good 

00:01:18.930 --> 00:01:22.650
 a block and bright the line is so 

00:01:20.910 --> 00:01:24.090
 quick that you do not have time to notice 

00:01:22.650 --> 00:01:26.370
 that goes out and always stays 

00:01:24.090 --> 00:01:28.230
 turned on so it is for example not 

00:01:26.370 --> 00:01:30.600
 we would be worth the second type of circuit 

00:01:28.230 --> 00:01:33.600
 that we have this that we can adjust the 

00:01:30.600 --> 00:01:36.070
 time for example by adding more delay 

00:01:33.600 --> 00:01:38.650
 to the repeaters for example if 

00:01:36.070 --> 00:01:41.800
 and how it is activated or with a torch 

00:01:38.650 --> 00:01:44.640
 we take it off quickly and we can take it out 

00:01:41.800 --> 00:01:47.680
 a sign here put the block here 

00:01:44.640 --> 00:01:50.350
 and effectively every so often 

00:01:47.680 --> 00:01:52.150
 will put and finally the last type of 

00:01:50.350 --> 00:01:53.890
 signal repeater would be this that would be 

00:01:52.150 --> 00:01:56.050
 one block the rest on top of the rest 

00:01:53.890 --> 00:01:57.460
 under a repeater looking in this 

00:01:56.050 --> 00:02:00.160
 position or so 

00:01:57.460 --> 00:02:02.610
 It worth subtracted a remainder here and we would lack 

00:02:00.160 --> 00:02:04.260
 the torch that would go here 

00:02:02.610 --> 00:02:05.730
 as you are seeing the signal of quite 

00:02:04.260 --> 00:02:07.430
 quick but you can adjust doing 

00:02:05.730 --> 00:02:11.390
 this 

00:02:07.430 --> 00:02:13.480
 and we can get out here and we can take out 

00:02:11.390 --> 00:02:15.410
 here a piece of signal an air this here 

00:02:13.480 --> 00:02:17.330
 what time is it going to light up 

00:02:15.410 --> 00:02:18.530
 we can also expand a lot more 

00:02:17.330 --> 00:02:20.180
 signal delay by putting more 

00:02:18.530 --> 00:02:21.850
 repeater in the same position with 

00:02:20.180 --> 00:02:24.350
 different time interval and 

00:02:21.850 --> 00:02:27.050
 simply connecting the torch with 

00:02:24.350 --> 00:02:28.850
 this so taking for example here and 

00:02:27.050 --> 00:02:33.460
 putting is here 

00:02:28.850 --> 00:02:37.670
 the signal was hard very much more pop pop 

00:02:33.460 --> 00:02:39.380
 pop pop so with this knowledge 

00:02:37.670 --> 00:02:42.410
 of the rest that can elaborate three types 

00:02:39.380 --> 00:02:43.760
 of lighthouse first second and third and each 

00:02:42.410 --> 00:02:46.250
 one has its particularities 

00:02:43.760 --> 00:02:47.360
 advantages and disadvantages the first as 

00:02:46.250 --> 00:02:48.620
 you are watching it works with a circuit 

00:02:47.360 --> 00:02:50.480
 that we have seen only that it has extended a 

00:02:48.620 --> 00:02:52.850
 little more and it's totally square something 

00:02:50.480 --> 00:02:54.110
 which is quite uncomfortable of course its 

00:02:52.850 --> 00:02:56.190
 very simple operation and its 

00:02:54.110 --> 00:02:59.990
 construction is simpler still 

00:02:56.190 --> 00:02:59.990
 with giving a button works correctly 

00:03:00.230 --> 00:03:03.739
 the second type of lighthouse is a bit more 

00:03:01.879 --> 00:03:06.700
 sexy since with just giving it a lever 

00:03:03.739 --> 00:03:06.700
 is activated 

00:03:07.610 --> 00:03:11.060
 but like all life everything that is 

00:03:09.290 --> 00:03:13.010
 sexy and beautiful needs a lot of work 

00:03:11.060 --> 00:03:15.320
 so you're seeing the circuit 

00:03:13.010 --> 00:03:16.910
 reston is quite complicated and for 

00:03:15.320 --> 00:03:18.340
 Of course I will not miss 0 that would be a 

00:03:16.910 --> 00:03:20.300
 complete engineering work and minecraft 

00:03:18.340 --> 00:03:22.910
 to put it into operation only 

00:03:20.300 --> 00:03:24.830
 you will have to press a lever and inside 

00:03:22.910 --> 00:03:26.690
 of the lighthouse intrinsic mechanism was activated 

00:03:24.830 --> 00:03:28.010
 of the rest quite complicated the body 

00:03:26.690 --> 00:03:30.380
 in the operation of this wonder 

00:03:28.010 --> 00:03:32.660
 of engineering quite elegant and very 

00:03:30.380 --> 00:03:34.340
 useful but to do it well done 

00:03:32.660 --> 00:03:36.020
 I would need a chapter for each lighthouse 

00:03:34.340 --> 00:03:37.280
 so I'll leave a link here 

00:03:36.020 --> 00:03:38.360
 corresponding to which is not 

00:03:37.280 --> 00:03:40.580
 will activate will be activated when they are 

00:03:38.360 --> 00:03:42.170
 hanging what measurement will do to each 

00:03:40.580 --> 00:03:44.780
 user for each type of lighthouse at 

00:03:42.170 --> 00:03:45.980
 first second and third so 

00:03:44.780 --> 00:03:48.110
 until the video arrives I will leave a 

00:03:45.980 --> 00:03:50.630
 moment of pause so that the links 

00:03:48.110 --> 00:03:55.150
 continue there and nothing more 

00:03:50.630 --> 00:03:55.150
 good luck and a lot of shit 

00:04:17.400 --> 00:04:21.060
 and good
