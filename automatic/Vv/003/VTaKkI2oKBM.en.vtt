but<00:00:31.180> I<00:00:31.210> could<00:00:31.390> be<00:00:31.509> wrong<00:00:31.689> about<00:00:31.750> that

00:00:32.280 --> 00:00:32.290 
but I could be wrong about that

00:00:32.290 --> 00:00:35.070 
but I could be wrong about that
something<00:00:32.890> like<00:00:32.949> that<00:00:33.190> though<00:00:33.449> 59<00:00:34.449> Les<00:00:34.750> Paul

00:00:35.070 --> 00:00:35.080 
something like that though 59 Les Paul

historic and a Jaguar twin will run it

00:00:38.739 --> 00:00:40.619 
historic and a Jaguar twin will run it
kind<00:00:38.949> of<00:00:39.070> clean<00:00:39.280> so<00:00:39.580> we<00:00:39.699> can<00:00:39.730> see<00:00:40.059> what<00:00:40.269> kind<00:00:40.300> of

00:00:40.619 --> 00:00:40.629 
kind of clean so we can see what kind of

00:00:40.629 --> 00:00:42.930 
kind of clean so we can see what kind of
gain<00:00:40.840> we<00:00:41.080> can<00:00:41.230> get<00:00:41.379> out<00:00:41.559> of<00:00:41.590> it<00:00:41.800> it<00:00:42.489> does<00:00:42.699> have<00:00:42.879> a

00:00:42.930 --> 00:00:42.940 
gain we can get out of it it does have a

00:00:42.940 --> 00:00:45.540 
gain we can get out of it it does have a
toggle<00:00:43.210> switch<00:00:43.420> on<00:00:43.840> it<00:00:44.140> and<00:00:44.290> flipped<00:00:45.160> to<00:00:45.430> the
