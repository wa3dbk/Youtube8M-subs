my recording software and I might have
to<00:01:25.650> upgrade<00:01:25.799> that<00:01:26.280> I<00:01:26.430> use<00:01:26.640> fraps<00:01:27.030> right<00:01:27.330> now

00:01:27.499 --> 00:01:27.509 
to upgrade that I use fraps right now

00:01:27.509 --> 00:01:29.600 
to upgrade that I use fraps right now
but<00:01:27.780> I'm<00:01:27.900> going<00:01:28.110> to<00:01:28.170> probably<00:01:28.380> upgrade<00:01:29.070> to<00:01:29.250> DX

00:01:29.600 --> 00:01:29.610

next<00:01:57.719> we<00:01:58.500> have<00:01:58.710> the<00:01:59.100> Elder<00:01:59.969> Scrolls<00:02:00.000> 5<00:02:00.600> skyrim

00:02:01.359 --> 00:02:01.369 
next we have the Elder Scrolls 5 skyrim

00:02:01.369 --> 00:02:05.990 
next we have the Elder Scrolls 5 skyrim
recorded<00:02:02.369> in<00:02:02.579> full<00:02:02.880> 1920<00:02:03.570> x<00:02:03.689> 1080<00:02:03.960> and<00:02:04.610> also<00:02:05.610> 60

00:02:05.990 --> 00:02:06.000 
recorded in full 1920 x 1080 and also 60

00:02:06.000 --> 00:02:07.969 
recorded in full 1920 x 1080 and also 60
frames<00:02:06.270> per<00:02:06.420> second<00:02:06.960> and<00:02:07.110> i<00:02:07.530> was<00:02:07.680> able<00:02:07.860> to

00:02:07.969 --> 00:02:07.979 
frames per second and i was able to

00:02:07.979 --> 00:02:10.580 
frames per second and i was able to
squeeze<00:02:08.220> about<00:02:08.550> 55<00:02:09.119> frames<00:02:09.509> roughly<00:02:10.259> per

00:02:10.580 --> 00:02:10.590 
squeeze about 55 frames roughly per

00:02:10.590 --> 00:02:12.830 
squeeze about 55 frames roughly per

00:02:12.830 --> 00:02:12.840 
second out of this clip and the next

00:02:12.840 --> 00:02:14.869 
second out of this clip and the next
clip<00:02:13.019> there's<00:02:13.769> a<00:02:13.860> few<00:02:14.160> challenges<00:02:14.489> to

00:02:14.869 --> 00:02:14.879 
clip there's a few challenges to

00:02:14.879 --> 00:02:17.030 
clip there's a few challenges to
overcome<00:02:14.940> here<00:02:15.569> first<00:02:15.900> of<00:02:16.019> all<00:02:16.170> I<00:02:16.200> had<00:02:16.500> to<00:02:16.530> drop

00:02:17.030 --> 00:02:17.040 
overcome here first of all I had to drop

00:02:17.040 --> 00:02:19.250 
overcome here first of all I had to drop
a<00:02:17.310> few<00:02:17.670> of<00:02:17.819> my<00:02:17.940> quality<00:02:18.180> settings<00:02:18.840> to<00:02:19.050> be<00:02:19.170> able

00:02:19.250 --> 00:02:19.260 
a few of my quality settings to be able

00:02:19.260 --> 00:02:22.360 
a few of my quality settings to be able
to<00:02:19.500> record<00:02:20.069> in<00:02:20.340> 60<00:02:21.150> frames<00:02:21.390> per<00:02:21.510> second<00:02:22.019> I

00:02:22.360 --> 00:02:22.370 
to record in 60 frames per second I

00:02:22.370 --> 00:02:24.890 
to record in 60 frames per second I
eliminated<00:02:23.420> anti-aliasing<00:02:24.420> and<00:02:24.540> I<00:02:24.660> dropped

00:02:24.890 --> 00:02:24.900 
eliminated anti-aliasing and I dropped

00:02:24.900 --> 00:02:27.020 
eliminated anti-aliasing and I dropped
my<00:02:25.140> anisotropic<00:02:26.010> filtering<00:02:26.040> down<00:02:26.670> a<00:02:26.730> little

00:02:27.020 --> 00:02:27.030 
my anisotropic filtering down a little

00:02:27.030 --> 00:02:30.199 
my anisotropic filtering down a little
bit<00:02:27.290> that's<00:02:28.580> typically<00:02:29.580> what<00:02:29.819> you<00:02:30.000> might<00:02:30.180> have

00:02:30.199 --> 00:02:30.209 
bit that's typically what you might have

00:02:30.209 --> 00:02:34.190 
bit that's typically what you might have
to<00:02:30.540> do<00:02:30.690> to<00:02:31.019> grab<00:02:31.860> 60<00:02:32.549> frames<00:02:32.790> per<00:02:32.910> second<00:02:33.390> also

00:02:34.190 --> 00:02:34.200 
to do to grab 60 frames per second also

00:02:34.200 --> 00:02:37.460 
to do to grab 60 frames per second also
there's<00:02:34.709> another<00:02:34.799> consideration<00:02:35.790> is<00:02:36.470> your

00:02:37.460 --> 00:02:37.470 
there's another consideration is your

00:02:37.470 --> 00:02:40.130 
there's another consideration is your
storage<00:02:38.310> device<00:02:38.730> that<00:02:39.030> you<00:02:39.180> are<00:02:39.360> recording<00:02:39.720> to

00:02:40.130 --> 00:02:40.140 
storage device that you are recording to

00:02:40.140 --> 00:02:42.830 
storage device that you are recording to
you<00:02:40.950> need<00:02:41.190> a<00:02:41.459> fast<00:02:41.940> storage<00:02:42.480> device

00:02:42.830 --> 00:02:42.840 
you need a fast storage device

00:02:42.840 --> 00:02:46.759 
you need a fast storage device
particularly<00:02:44.360> something<00:02:45.360> solid<00:02:45.690> state<00:02:46.200> so

00:02:46.759 --> 00:02:46.769 
particularly something solid state so

00:02:46.769 --> 00:02:49.670 
particularly something solid state so
I've<00:02:47.099> got<00:02:47.610> a<00:02:47.640> solid<00:02:47.940> state<00:02:48.360> drive<00:02:48.690> and<00:02:48.989> it's

00:02:49.670 --> 00:02:49.680 
I've got a solid state drive and it's

00:02:49.680 --> 00:02:53.589 
I've got a solid state drive and it's
using<00:02:50.010> a<00:02:50.099> SATA<00:02:50.370> 3<00:02:50.730> bus<00:02:50.940> I'm<00:02:51.360> able<00:02:51.780> to<00:02:52.140> record

00:02:53.589 --> 00:02:53.599 
using a SATA 3 bus I'm able to record

00:02:53.599 --> 00:02:57.830 
using a SATA 3 bus I'm able to record
roughly<00:02:54.599> I<00:02:54.630> think<00:02:55.049> it's<00:02:55.489> 300<00:02:56.660> megabits<00:02:57.660> per

00:02:57.830 --> 00:02:57.840 
roughly I think it's 300 megabits per

00:02:57.840 --> 00:03:00.589 
roughly I think it's 300 megabits per
second<00:02:58.410> on<00:02:58.650> to<00:02:58.709> the<00:02:59.579> drive<00:02:59.849> which<00:03:00.150> is<00:03:00.329> pretty

00:03:00.589 --> 00:03:00.599 
second on to the drive which is pretty

00:03:00.599 --> 00:03:03.830 
second on to the drive which is pretty
much<00:03:00.840> all<00:03:01.019> you<00:03:01.049> need<00:03:01.200> for<00:03:01.680> 1080p<00:03:02.030> now<00:03:03.030> the

00:03:03.830 --> 00:03:03.840 
much all you need for 1080p now the

00:03:03.840 --> 00:03:05.660 
much all you need for 1080p now the
technical<00:03:04.769> challenge<00:03:05.129> that<00:03:05.250> I<00:03:05.370> have<00:03:05.549> to

00:03:05.660 --> 00:03:05.670 
technical challenge that I have to

00:03:05.670 --> 00:03:08.390 
technical challenge that I have to
overcome<00:03:06.180> is<00:03:06.510> in<00:03:06.930> the<00:03:07.140> games<00:03:07.410> themselves<00:03:07.739> and

00:03:08.390 --> 00:03:08.400 
overcome is in the games themselves and

00:03:08.400 --> 00:03:11.150 
overcome is in the games themselves and
there<00:03:09.209> were<00:03:09.329> even<00:03:09.510> tougher<00:03:10.500> technical

00:03:11.150 --> 00:03:11.160 
there were even tougher technical

00:03:11.160 --> 00:03:13.280 
there were even tougher technical
challenges<00:03:11.579> and<00:03:11.819> fallout<00:03:12.060> 3<00:03:12.629> because<00:03:13.049> it's

00:03:13.280 --> 00:03:13.290 
challenges and fallout 3 because it's

00:03:13.290 --> 00:03:14.869 
challenges and fallout 3 because it's
not<00:03:13.470> very<00:03:13.650> well<00:03:13.920> optimized<00:03:14.489> and<00:03:14.640> it<00:03:14.760> was

00:03:14.869 --> 00:03:14.879 
not very well optimized and it was

00:03:14.879 --> 00:03:17.330 
not very well optimized and it was
certainly<00:03:15.239> never<00:03:15.480> optimized<00:03:16.200> to<00:03:16.349> record<00:03:17.010> at

00:03:17.330 --> 00:03:17.340 
certainly never optimized to record at

00:03:17.340 --> 00:03:21.830 
certainly never optimized to record at
1080p<00:03:18.150> at<00:03:18.750> 60<00:03:19.680> frames<00:03:19.709> per<00:03:20.100> second<00:03:20.670> but<00:03:21.150> Skyrim

00:03:21.830 --> 00:03:21.840 
1080p at 60 frames per second but Skyrim

00:03:21.840 --> 00:03:23.930 
1080p at 60 frames per second but Skyrim
is<00:03:21.870> a<00:03:22.049> newer<00:03:22.319> games<00:03:22.590> so<00:03:23.069> and<00:03:23.340> it's<00:03:23.730> been

00:03:23.930 --> 00:03:23.940 
is a newer games so and it's been

00:03:23.940 --> 00:03:27.289 
is a newer games so and it's been
through<00:03:24.150> many<00:03:24.269> updates<00:03:25.459> rather<00:03:26.459> recently<00:03:27.000> too

00:03:27.289 --> 00:03:27.299 
through many updates rather recently too

00:03:27.299 --> 00:03:30.110 
through many updates rather recently too
so<00:03:27.930> I<00:03:28.139> was<00:03:28.349> able<00:03:28.530> to<00:03:28.739> squeeze<00:03:28.980> most<00:03:29.730> of<00:03:29.880> it<00:03:29.970> out

00:03:30.110 --> 00:03:30.120 
so I was able to squeeze most of it out

00:03:30.120 --> 00:03:32.479 
so I was able to squeeze most of it out
and<00:03:30.329> I<00:03:30.750> think<00:03:31.019> if<00:03:31.139> i<00:03:31.290> increase<00:03:31.709> my<00:03:32.010> graphics

00:03:32.479 --> 00:03:32.489 
and I think if i increase my graphics

00:03:32.489 --> 00:03:34.280 
and I think if i increase my graphics
card<00:03:32.579> and<00:03:32.970> if<00:03:33.060> I<00:03:33.150> just<00:03:33.359> change<00:03:33.599> my<00:03:33.660> recording

00:03:34.280 --> 00:03:34.290 
card and if I just change my recording

00:03:34.290 --> 00:03:36.710 
card and if I just change my recording
software<00:03:34.319> to<00:03:34.889> record<00:03:35.220> 22<00:03:35.609> different<00:03:36.269> drives

00:03:36.710 --> 00:03:36.720 
software to record 22 different drives

00:03:36.720 --> 00:03:38.690 
software to record 22 different drives
at<00:03:36.959> once<00:03:37.200> then<00:03:37.440> I'll<00:03:37.560> be<00:03:37.709> able<00:03:37.739> to<00:03:37.920> easily

00:03:38.690 --> 00:03:38.700 
at once then I'll be able to easily

00:03:38.700 --> 00:03:43.129 
at once then I'll be able to easily
record<00:03:39.480> in<00:03:39.660> 60<00:03:40.500> frames<00:03:40.889> per<00:03:41.010> second<00:03:42.139> alright

00:03:43.129 --> 00:03:43.139 
record in 60 frames per second alright

00:03:43.139 --> 00:03:45.589 
record in 60 frames per second alright
finally<00:03:43.680> we<00:03:43.829> get<00:03:43.919> to<00:03:43.980> fallout<00:03:44.609> 3<00:03:44.970> which<00:03:45.269> is<00:03:45.450> I

00:03:45.589 --> 00:03:45.599 
finally we get to fallout 3 which is I

00:03:45.599 --> 00:03:47.390 
finally we get to fallout 3 which is I
think<00:03:45.660> what<00:03:46.139> everyone<00:03:46.560> has<00:03:46.709> been<00:03:46.739> waiting<00:03:47.069> for

00:03:47.390 --> 00:03:47.400 
think what everyone has been waiting for

00:03:47.400 --> 00:03:51.409 
think what everyone has been waiting for
so<00:03:47.910> I<00:03:48.239> recorded<00:03:48.959> this<00:03:49.380> clip<00:03:49.739> real<00:03:50.489> time<00:03:50.819> in<00:03:51.000> 60

00:03:51.409 --> 00:03:51.419 
so I recorded this clip real time in 60

00:03:51.419 --> 00:03:54.650 
so I recorded this clip real time in 60
frames<00:03:51.720> per<00:03:51.840> second<00:03:52.440> now<00:03:53.040> notice<00:03:53.430> that<00:03:53.819> it

00:03:54.650 --> 00:03:54.660 
frames per second now notice that it

00:03:54.660 --> 00:03:56.839 
frames per second now notice that it
does<00:03:54.900> chop<00:03:55.620> around<00:03:55.799> a<00:03:56.099> little<00:03:56.250> bit<00:03:56.430> there<00:03:56.700> is<00:03:56.819> a

00:03:56.839 --> 00:03:56.849 
does chop around a little bit there is a

00:03:56.849 --> 00:03:58.670 
does chop around a little bit there is a
little<00:03:57.180> bit<00:03:57.269> of<00:03:57.359> chopped<00:03:57.599> it's<00:03:57.959> not<00:03:58.230> that<00:03:58.290> bad

00:03:58.670 --> 00:03:58.680 
little bit of chopped it's not that bad

00:03:58.680 --> 00:04:01.670 
little bit of chopped it's not that bad
and<00:03:59.239> again<00:04:00.239> this<00:04:00.359> is<00:04:00.540> just<00:04:00.660> my<00:04:00.870> first<00:04:01.079> attempt

00:04:01.670 --> 00:04:01.680 
and again this is just my first attempt

00:04:01.680 --> 00:04:03.909 
and again this is just my first attempt
after<00:04:01.859> farting<00:04:02.549> around<00:04:02.669> with<00:04:02.880> settings<00:04:03.150> and

00:04:03.909 --> 00:04:03.919 
after farting around with settings and

00:04:03.919 --> 00:04:06.199 
after farting around with settings and
changing<00:04:04.919> some<00:04:05.130> scripts<00:04:05.579> a<00:04:05.669> little<00:04:05.910> bit<00:04:06.030> for

00:04:06.199 --> 00:04:06.209 
changing some scripts a little bit for

00:04:06.209 --> 00:04:08.360 
changing some scripts a little bit for
about<00:04:06.419> 10<00:04:06.690> minutes<00:04:06.930> so<00:04:07.560> i'll<00:04:07.769> definitely<00:04:08.340> be

00:04:08.360 --> 00:04:08.370 
about 10 minutes so i'll definitely be

00:04:08.370 --> 00:04:10.370 
about 10 minutes so i'll definitely be
optimizing<00:04:09.030> this<00:04:09.359> a<00:04:09.389> lot<00:04:09.630> more<00:04:09.900> and<00:04:10.109> i'll<00:04:10.260> be

00:04:10.370 --> 00:04:10.380 
optimizing this a lot more and i'll be

00:04:10.380 --> 00:04:12.819 
optimizing this a lot more and i'll be
able<00:04:10.470> to<00:04:10.680> record<00:04:11.069> in<00:04:11.310> 60<00:04:11.730> frames<00:04:12.000> per<00:04:12.150> second

00:04:12.819 --> 00:04:12.829 
able to record in 60 frames per second

00:04:12.829 --> 00:04:15.259 
able to record in 60 frames per second
seamlessly<00:04:13.829> so<00:04:14.099> everything<00:04:14.579> will<00:04:14.669> be<00:04:14.819> silky

00:04:15.259 --> 00:04:15.269 
seamlessly so everything will be silky

00:04:15.269 --> 00:04:19.069 
seamlessly so everything will be silky
smooth<00:04:15.599> now<00:04:16.380> I<00:04:17.370> do<00:04:17.669> sometimes<00:04:18.329> record<00:04:18.959> in

00:04:19.069 --> 00:04:19.079 
smooth now I do sometimes record in

00:04:19.079 --> 00:04:20.930 
smooth now I do sometimes record in
bullet<00:04:19.470> time<00:04:19.709> and<00:04:19.979> I<00:04:20.039> am<00:04:20.130> going<00:04:20.370> to<00:04:20.459> show<00:04:20.700> you<00:04:20.729> a

00:04:43.970 --> 00:04:43.980 
SATA drives might be able to handle it

00:04:43.980 --> 00:04:48.890 
SATA drives might be able to handle it
but<00:04:44.130> not<00:04:44.640> right<00:04:45.210> now<00:04:45.920> we're<00:04:46.920> just<00:04:47.900> heralding

00:04:48.890 --> 00:04:48.900 
but not right now we're just heralding

00:04:52.040 --> 00:04:52.050 
in the 60 frame per second age so and

00:04:52.050 --> 00:04:54.770 
in the 60 frame per second age so and
YouTube<00:04:52.650> is<00:04:52.920> was<00:04:53.430> just<00:04:53.730> releasing<00:04:54.270> that<00:04:54.420> today

00:04:54.770 --> 00:04:54.780 
YouTube is was just releasing that today

00:04:54.780 --> 00:04:56.780 
YouTube is was just releasing that today
so<00:04:54.840> it's<00:04:55.620> going<00:04:55.830> to<00:04:55.920> be<00:04:56.010> several<00:04:56.370> years<00:04:56.490> before

00:04:56.780 --> 00:04:56.790 
so it's going to be several years before

00:04:56.790 --> 00:04:58.730 
so it's going to be several years before
people<00:04:57.510> figure<00:04:57.870> that<00:04:58.080> out<00:04:58.110> and<00:04:58.470> start

00:04:58.730 --> 00:04:58.740 
people figure that out and start

00:04:58.740 --> 00:05:00.590 
people figure that out and start
releasing<00:04:58.980> hardware<00:04:59.610> that's<00:04:59.820> capable<00:05:00.090> of

00:05:00.590 --> 00:05:00.600 
releasing hardware that's capable of

00:05:00.600 --> 00:05:05.060 
releasing hardware that's capable of

recording 1440p high-definition 60
frames<00:05:05.310> per<00:05:05.400> second<00:05:05.910> okay<00:05:06.510> now<00:05:06.870> this<00:05:07.260> last

00:05:07.640 --> 00:05:07.650 
frames per second okay now this last

00:05:07.650 --> 00:05:10.460 
frames per second okay now this last
clip<00:05:08.130> will<00:05:08.520> be<00:05:08.550> silky<00:05:09.210> smooth<00:05:09.540> and<00:05:09.870> the<00:05:10.140> reason

00:05:10.460 --> 00:05:10.470 
clip will be silky smooth and the reason

00:05:10.470 --> 00:05:13.790 
clip will be silky smooth and the reason
is<00:05:10.650> i<00:05:10.920> recorded<00:05:11.880> this<00:05:12.030> at<00:05:12.300> bullet<00:05:12.900> time<00:05:13.140> at<00:05:13.470> 30

00:05:13.790 --> 00:05:13.800 
is i recorded this at bullet time at 30

00:05:13.800 --> 00:05:16.730 
is i recorded this at bullet time at 30
frames<00:05:14.040> per<00:05:14.280> second<00:05:14.850> when<00:05:15.510> I<00:05:15.540> in<00:05:15.870> the<00:05:16.230> game<00:05:16.440> and

00:05:16.730 --> 00:05:16.740 
frames per second when I in the game and

00:05:16.740 --> 00:05:19.550 
frames per second when I in the game and
then<00:05:17.220> what<00:05:17.370> I<00:05:17.400> did<00:05:17.670> I<00:05:17.910> doubled<00:05:18.870> the<00:05:19.050> speed<00:05:19.170> of

00:05:19.550 --> 00:05:19.560 
then what I did I doubled the speed of

00:05:19.560 --> 00:05:21.680 
then what I did I doubled the speed of
the<00:05:19.920> video<00:05:20.460> and<00:05:20.760> double<00:05:21.090> the<00:05:21.210> speed<00:05:21.420> of<00:05:21.570> the

00:05:21.680 --> 00:05:21.690 
the video and double the speed of the

00:05:21.690 --> 00:05:25.760 
the video and double the speed of the
audio<00:05:22.050> and<00:05:22.230> the<00:05:22.710> result<00:05:23.130> is<00:05:23.400> a<00:05:23.930> true<00:05:24.930> 60<00:05:25.530> frame

00:05:25.760 --> 00:05:25.770 
audio and the result is a true 60 frame

00:05:25.770 --> 00:05:28.940 
audio and the result is a true 60 frame
per<00:05:25.800> second<00:05:26.720> clip<00:05:27.720> and<00:05:27.990> you<00:05:28.470> are<00:05:28.680> watching

00:05:28.940 --> 00:05:28.950 
per second clip and you are watching

00:05:28.950 --> 00:05:31.040 
per second clip and you are watching
this<00:05:29.400> at<00:05:29.610> 60<00:05:29.970> frames<00:05:30.000> per<00:05:30.330> second<00:05:30.840> and<00:05:30.960> you

00:05:31.040 --> 00:05:31.050 
this at 60 frames per second and you

00:05:31.050 --> 00:05:32.810 
this at 60 frames per second and you
should<00:05:31.260> easily<00:05:31.560> be<00:05:31.800> able<00:05:31.980> to<00:05:32.280> tell<00:05:32.490> that<00:05:32.670> this

00:05:32.810 --> 00:05:32.820 
should easily be able to tell that this

00:05:32.820 --> 00:05:36.170 
should easily be able to tell that this
is<00:05:33.000> 60<00:05:33.360> frames<00:05:33.570> per<00:05:33.720> second<00:05:34.200> I<00:05:34.320> even<00:05:34.980> did<00:05:35.220> a<00:05:35.430> 60

00:05:36.170 --> 00:05:36.180 
is 60 frames per second I even did a 60

00:05:36.180 --> 00:05:39.050 
is 60 frames per second I even did a 60
frame<00:05:36.360> per<00:05:36.390> second<00:05:36.870> test<00:05:37.170> before<00:05:37.740> the<00:05:38.490> that

00:05:39.050 --> 00:05:39.060 
frame per second test before the that

00:05:39.060 --> 00:05:41.240 
frame per second test before the that
support<00:05:39.480> was<00:05:39.630> even<00:05:39.900> released<00:05:40.080> on<00:05:40.590> YouTube<00:05:41.070> and

00:05:41.240 --> 00:05:41.250 
support was even released on YouTube and

00:05:41.250 --> 00:05:44.360 
support was even released on YouTube and
the<00:05:41.760> way<00:05:41.850> I<00:05:41.880> did<00:05:42.030> that<00:05:42.390> was<00:05:42.570> I<00:05:43.170> asked<00:05:43.950> people<00:05:44.340> to

00:05:44.360 --> 00:05:44.370 
the way I did that was I asked people to

00:05:44.370 --> 00:05:47.240 
the way I did that was I asked people to
speed<00:05:44.790> up<00:05:44.940> the<00:05:44.970> video<00:05:45.270> 22<00:05:46.230> times<00:05:46.530> but<00:05:47.040> now<00:05:47.190> you

00:05:47.240 --> 00:05:47.250 
speed up the video 22 times but now you

00:05:47.250 --> 00:05:48.800 
speed up the video 22 times but now you
don't<00:05:47.490> have<00:05:47.610> to<00:05:47.820> do<00:05:47.940> that<00:05:47.970> youtube

00:05:48.800 --> 00:05:48.810 
don't have to do that youtube

00:05:48.810 --> 00:05:51.340 
don't have to do that youtube
essentially<00:05:49.440> does<00:05:49.680> that<00:05:50.120> automatically

00:05:51.340 --> 00:05:51.350 
essentially does that automatically

00:05:51.350 --> 00:05:54.440 
essentially does that automatically
because<00:05:52.350> it<00:05:52.530> officially<00:05:53.310> supports<00:05:53.760> 60<00:05:54.150> frames

00:05:54.440 --> 00:05:54.450 
because it officially supports 60 frames

00:05:54.450 --> 00:05:58.430 
because it officially supports 60 frames
per<00:05:54.570> second<00:05:55.140> a<00:05:56.060> problem<00:05:57.060> with<00:05:57.240> the<00:05:57.390> videos<00:05:57.810> the

00:05:58.430 --> 00:05:58.440 
per second a problem with the videos the

00:05:58.440 --> 00:05:59.900 
per second a problem with the videos the
size<00:05:58.740> of<00:05:58.890> the<00:05:58.980> videos<00:05:59.310> is<00:05:59.490> that<00:05:59.640> they're<00:05:59.790> now

00:05:59.900 --> 00:05:59.910 
size of the videos is that they're now

00:05:59.910 --> 00:06:03.260 
size of the videos is that they're now
twice<00:06:00.180> as<00:06:00.420> large<00:06:00.660> so<00:06:01.700> that's<00:06:02.700> another<00:06:03.000> reason

00:06:03.260 --> 00:06:03.270 
twice as large so that's another reason

00:06:03.270 --> 00:06:06.020 
twice as large so that's another reason
why<00:06:03.540> I<00:06:03.570> can't<00:06:03.750> handle<00:06:04.280> 1440p<00:06:05.280> at<00:06:05.610> 60<00:06:06.000> frames

00:06:06.020 --> 00:06:06.030 
why I can't handle 1440p at 60 frames

00:06:06.030 --> 00:06:09.860 
why I can't handle 1440p at 60 frames
and<00:06:06.600> certainly<00:06:07.590> not<00:06:07.830> 4k<00:06:08.310> videos<00:06:09.030> at<00:06:09.270> 60<00:06:09.840> frames

00:06:09.860 --> 00:06:09.870 
and certainly not 4k videos at 60 frames

00:06:09.870 --> 00:06:11.330 
and certainly not 4k videos at 60 frames
per<00:06:10.230> second

00:06:11.330 --> 00:06:11.340 
per second

00:06:11.340 --> 00:06:14.480 
per second
and<00:06:12.240> the<00:06:12.810> next<00:06:13.080> logical<00:06:13.260> question<00:06:13.590> to<00:06:14.010> ask<00:06:14.160> is

00:06:14.480 --> 00:06:14.490 
and the next logical question to ask is

00:06:14.490 --> 00:06:16.610 
and the next logical question to ask is
whether<00:06:14.669> i'm<00:06:14.940> going<00:06:14.970> to<00:06:15.360> start<00:06:15.630> uploading<00:06:16.139> all

00:06:16.610 --> 00:06:16.620 
whether i'm going to start uploading all

00:06:16.620 --> 00:06:18.650 
whether i'm going to start uploading all
of<00:06:16.680> my<00:06:17.070> walkthroughs<00:06:17.610> and<00:06:17.699> 60<00:06:18.180> frames<00:06:18.510> per

00:06:18.650 --> 00:06:18.660 
of my walkthroughs and 60 frames per

00:06:18.660 --> 00:06:23.390 
of my walkthroughs and 60 frames per
second<00:06:19.199> well<00:06:19.860> i<00:06:20.100> did<00:06:20.610> a<00:06:20.970> comparison<00:06:21.930> and<00:06:22.470> you

00:06:23.390 --> 00:06:23.400 
second well i did a comparison and you

00:06:23.400 --> 00:06:25.550 
second well i did a comparison and you
know<00:06:23.460> like<00:06:23.610> a<00:06:23.639> personal<00:06:24.150> assessment<00:06:24.720> of<00:06:24.810> which

00:06:25.550 --> 00:06:25.560 
know like a personal assessment of which

00:06:25.560 --> 00:06:28.280 
know like a personal assessment of which
is<00:06:25.800> more<00:06:26.040> important<00:06:26.490> higher<00:06:27.270> quality<00:06:27.960> video

00:06:28.280 --> 00:06:28.290 
is more important higher quality video

00:06:28.290 --> 00:06:33.200 
is more important higher quality video
or<00:06:29.660> faster<00:06:30.660> frame<00:06:30.900> rate<00:06:31.139> and<00:06:31.790> i'm<00:06:32.790> going<00:06:33.120> to

00:06:33.200 --> 00:06:33.210 
or faster frame rate and i'm going to

00:06:33.210 --> 00:06:36.620 
or faster frame rate and i'm going to
take<00:06:33.479> a<00:06:33.510> survey<00:06:34.470> among<00:06:34.919> my<00:06:35.520> viewers<00:06:36.150> but<00:06:36.419> i

00:06:36.620 --> 00:06:36.630 
take a survey among my viewers but i

00:06:36.630 --> 00:06:38.510 
take a survey among my viewers but i
think<00:06:37.080> the<00:06:37.229> consensus<00:06:37.590> is<00:06:37.889> going<00:06:38.130> to<00:06:38.220> be<00:06:38.340> that

00:06:38.510 --> 00:06:38.520 
think the consensus is going to be that

00:06:38.520 --> 00:06:40.820 
think the consensus is going to be that
we<00:06:38.639> would<00:06:38.760> rather<00:06:38.910> see<00:06:39.270> 60<00:06:39.840> frames<00:06:40.110> per<00:06:40.260> second

00:06:40.820 --> 00:06:40.830 
we would rather see 60 frames per second

00:06:40.830 --> 00:06:43.850 
we would rather see 60 frames per second
footage<00:06:41.669> rather<00:06:42.060> than<00:06:42.389> trying<00:06:43.199> to<00:06:43.380> bump<00:06:43.650> my

00:06:43.850 --> 00:06:43.860 
footage rather than trying to bump my

quality<00:06:44.550> all<00:06:44.700> the<00:06:44.790> way<00:06:44.910> up<00:06:45.030> to<00:06:45.060> 4k<00:06:45.600> resolution

00:06:46.310 --> 00:06:46.320

00:06:46.320 --> 00:06:49.520 
quality all the way up to 4k resolution
the<00:06:47.070> reason<00:06:47.400> i<00:06:47.520> did<00:06:47.700> the<00:06:47.850> 4k<00:06:48.270> is<00:06:48.510> because<00:06:48.900> for

the reason i did the 4k is because for

00:06:49.530 --> 00:06:53.330 
the reason i did the 4k is because for

00:07:08.210 --> 00:07:08.220

monitors that's right mine so it's I'm
thinking<00:07:08.639> about<00:07:08.850> the<00:07:08.970> future<00:07:09.150> but<00:07:09.750> this<00:07:10.590> is

00:07:10.790 --> 00:07:10.800 
thinking about the future but this is

thinking about the future but this is
the<00:07:10.889> first<00:07:10.919> time<00:07:11.310> that<00:07:11.370> YouTube<00:07:11.910> has<00:07:11.940> released

00:07:12.560 --> 00:07:12.570 
the first time that YouTube has released

00:07:12.570 --> 00:07:14.990 
the first time that YouTube has released
the<00:07:13.080> 60<00:07:13.410> frame<00:07:13.590> per<00:07:13.620> second<00:07:14.130> support<00:07:14.490> so<00:07:14.820> we'll

00:07:14.990 --> 00:07:15.000 
the 60 frame per second support so we'll

00:07:15.000 --> 00:07:16.670 
the 60 frame per second support so we'll
probably<00:07:15.210> take<00:07:15.630> advantage<00:07:16.110> of<00:07:16.229> that<00:07:16.380> for<00:07:16.650> a

00:07:16.670 --> 00:07:16.680 
probably take advantage of that for a

00:07:16.680 --> 00:07:19.610 
probably take advantage of that for a
