you guys about some protein supplements

00:00:04.650 --> 00:00:07.849 
you guys about some protein supplements
for<00:00:04.830> women<00:00:05.069> so<00:00:05.940> of<00:00:06.690> course<00:00:07.020> it's<00:00:07.200> important<00:00:07.710> to

for women so of course it's important to
get<00:00:08.010> your<00:00:08.400> protein<00:00:09.120> from<00:00:09.179> the<00:00:09.599> foods<00:00:09.840> that<00:00:09.900> you

here is my first one this one is called
lean<00:00:38.550> desert<00:00:38.730> it's<00:00:39.149> a<00:00:39.270> protein<00:00:39.690> shake<00:00:39.750> it's<00:00:40.430> by

00:00:41.420 --> 00:00:41.430 
lean desert it's a protein shake it's by

00:00:41.430 --> 00:00:44.869 
lean desert it's a protein shake it's by
the<00:00:41.489> company<00:00:42.059> BSN<00:00:42.780> so<00:00:43.410> this<00:00:43.920> one<00:00:44.129> is<00:00:44.309> super

00:00:44.869 --> 00:00:44.879

00:00:48.510 --> 00:00:50.180 
good because it tastes amazing a lot of
the<00:00:48.629> proteins<00:00:48.989> that<00:00:49.260> you're<00:00:49.440> going<00:00:49.559> to<00:00:49.590> try<00:00:49.800> if

00:00:50.180 --> 00:00:50.190 
the proteins that you're going to try if

00:00:50.190 --> 00:00:52.189 
the proteins that you're going to try if
they<00:00:50.700> taste<00:00:50.910> really<00:00:51.120> good<00:00:51.390> they're<00:00:51.660> generally

00:00:52.189 --> 00:00:52.199 
they taste really good they're generally

they taste really good they're generally
the<00:00:52.379> ones<00:00:52.649> that<00:00:53.010> either<00:00:53.280> cost<00:00:53.640> a<00:00:53.879> ton<00:00:54.690> of<00:00:54.750> money

00:00:55.279 --> 00:00:55.289 
the ones that either cost a ton of money

00:00:55.289 --> 00:00:59.090 
the ones that either cost a ton of money
or<00:00:55.559> BR<00:00:56.520> the<00:00:56.670> mass<00:00:56.910> gainers<00:00:57.510> so<00:00:58.379> the<00:00:58.920> mass

00:00:59.090 --> 00:00:59.100 
or BR the mass gainers so the mass

00:00:59.100 --> 00:01:00.380 
or BR the mass gainers so the mass
gainer<00:00:59.340> is<00:00:59.520> they<00:00:59.670> have<00:00:59.760> a<00:00:59.789> lot<00:01:00.000> of<00:01:00.059> calories

00:01:00.380 --> 00:01:00.390 
gainer is they have a lot of calories

00:01:00.390 --> 00:01:02.900 
gainer is they have a lot of calories
and<00:01:01.020> stuff<00:01:01.199> like<00:01:01.350> that<00:01:01.590> and<00:01:01.829> just<00:01:02.460> excess

00:01:02.900 --> 00:01:02.910 
and stuff like that and just excess

00:01:02.910 --> 00:01:04.520 
and stuff like that and just excess
amounts<00:01:03.270> of<00:01:03.329> protein<00:01:03.690> that<00:01:03.840> us<00:01:03.989> as<00:01:04.140> women

00:01:04.520 --> 00:01:04.530 
amounts of protein that us as women

00:01:04.530 --> 00:01:05.990 
amounts of protein that us as women
would<00:01:04.710> it<00:01:04.830> need<00:01:05.159> because<00:01:05.400> we're<00:01:05.670> not<00:01:05.760> trying

00:01:05.990 --> 00:01:06.000 
would it need because we're not trying

00:01:06.000 --> 00:01:08.179 
would it need because we're not trying
to<00:01:06.060> build<00:01:06.299> that<00:01:06.450> much<00:01:06.630> muscle<00:01:06.930> so<00:01:07.680> I<00:01:07.710> really

00:01:08.179 --> 00:01:08.189 
to build that much muscle so I really

00:01:08.189 --> 00:01:10.039 
to build that much muscle so I really
like<00:01:08.369> this<00:01:08.610> one<00:01:08.760> because<00:01:08.939> it's<00:01:09.390> first<00:01:09.780> of<00:01:09.930> all

00:01:10.039 --> 00:01:10.049 
like this one because it's first of all

00:01:10.049 --> 00:01:12.469 
like this one because it's first of all
lean<00:01:10.619> is<00:01:10.979> right<00:01:11.250> in<00:01:11.400> the<00:01:11.520> name<00:01:11.760> which<00:01:12.299> is

00:01:12.469 --> 00:01:12.479 
lean is right in the name which is

00:01:12.479 --> 00:01:14.780 
lean is right in the name which is
really<00:01:12.780> good<00:01:12.990> but<00:01:13.770> it's<00:01:14.189> pretty<00:01:14.460> cute<00:01:14.610> the

00:01:14.780 --> 00:01:14.790 
really good but it's pretty cute the

00:01:14.790 --> 00:01:16.730 
really good but it's pretty cute the
marketing<00:01:15.210> of<00:01:15.299> it's<00:01:15.479> called<00:01:15.659> lean<00:01:15.869> desert<00:01:16.020> but

00:01:16.730 --> 00:01:16.740 
marketing of it's called lean desert but

00:01:16.740 --> 00:01:20.450 
marketing of it's called lean desert but
this<00:01:16.920> protein<00:01:17.340> tastes<00:01:17.820> so<00:01:18.150> so<00:01:18.900> amazing<00:01:19.460> so

00:01:20.450 --> 00:01:20.460 
this protein tastes so so amazing so

00:01:20.460 --> 00:01:22.010 
this protein tastes so so amazing so
like<00:01:20.610> I<00:01:20.729> said<00:01:20.880> it's<00:01:21.000> whipped<00:01:21.270> vanilla<00:01:21.479> cream

00:01:22.010 --> 00:01:22.020 
like I said it's whipped vanilla cream

00:01:22.020 --> 00:01:26.570 
like I said it's whipped vanilla cream
flavor<00:01:22.520> and<00:01:23.810> let's<00:01:24.810> see<00:01:24.990> here<00:01:25.229> it's<00:01:25.770> got<00:01:25.860> 150

00:01:26.570 --> 00:01:26.580 
flavor and let's see here it's got 150

00:01:26.580 --> 00:01:29.120 
flavor and let's see here it's got 150
calories<00:01:26.820> per<00:01:27.240> serving<00:01:28.110> so<00:01:28.560> that's<00:01:28.860> one

00:01:29.120 --> 00:01:29.130 
calories per serving so that's one

00:01:29.130 --> 00:01:32.149 
calories per serving so that's one
heaping<00:01:29.579> scoop<00:01:30.060> and<00:01:30.540> it's<00:01:31.259> got<00:01:31.619> through<00:01:31.920> only

00:01:32.149 --> 00:01:32.159 
heaping scoop and it's got through only

00:01:32.159 --> 00:01:35.539 
heaping scoop and it's got through only
3.5<00:01:32.670> grams<00:01:32.909> of<00:01:33.150> fat<00:01:33.390> and<00:01:33.630> 21<00:01:34.500> grams<00:01:34.860> of<00:01:35.130> protein

00:01:35.539 --> 00:01:35.549 
3.5 grams of fat and 21 grams of protein

00:01:35.549 --> 00:01:37.880 
3.5 grams of fat and 21 grams of protein
so<00:01:36.150> I<00:01:36.180> really<00:01:36.659> like<00:01:36.869> this<00:01:37.079> one<00:01:37.320> I'm<00:01:37.619> going<00:01:37.829> to

00:01:37.880 --> 00:01:37.890 
so I really like this one I'm going to

00:01:37.890 --> 00:01:40.789 
so I really like this one I'm going to
upload<00:01:38.189> a<00:01:38.220> video<00:01:38.369> on<00:01:38.900> this<00:01:39.900> little<00:01:40.320> protein

00:01:40.789 --> 00:01:40.799 
upload a video on this little protein

00:01:40.799 --> 00:01:42.859 
upload a video on this little protein
shake<00:01:41.009> that<00:01:41.189> I<00:01:41.250> do<00:01:41.310> with<00:01:41.549> this<00:01:41.729> everyday<00:01:42.060> it's

amazing it tastes really good and it

00:01:45.509 --> 00:01:47.899 
amazing it tastes really good and it
tastes<00:01:45.810> personally<00:01:46.320> like<00:01:46.860> a<00:01:46.890> milkshake<00:01:47.310> so

00:01:47.899 --> 00:01:47.909 
tastes personally like a milkshake so

00:01:47.909 --> 00:01:49.580 
tastes personally like a milkshake so
it's<00:01:48.180> really<00:01:48.420> enjoyable<00:01:48.630> to<00:01:49.049> eat<00:01:49.229> this

00:01:49.580 --> 00:01:49.590 
it's really enjoyable to eat this

00:01:49.590 --> 00:01:54.560 
it's really enjoyable to eat this
protein<00:01:51.950> so<00:01:52.950> this<00:01:53.430> is<00:01:53.640> my<00:01:53.790> second<00:01:54.210> protein

00:01:54.560 --> 00:01:54.570 
protein so this is my second protein

00:01:54.570 --> 00:01:58.819 
protein so this is my second protein
that<00:01:54.689> I<00:01:54.750> use<00:01:55.170> I<00:01:55.200> have<00:01:55.590> two<00:01:55.979> this<00:01:56.610> one<00:01:56.820> is<00:01:57.119> a<00:01:57.829> 365

00:01:58.819 --> 00:01:58.829 
that I use I have two this one is a 365

00:01:58.829 --> 00:02:01.370 
that I use I have two this one is a 365
it's<00:01:59.219> everyday<00:01:59.790> everyday<00:02:00.540> value<00:02:00.990> this<00:02:01.200> one's

00:02:01.370 --> 00:02:01.380 
it's everyday everyday value this one's

00:02:01.380 --> 00:02:03.590 
it's everyday everyday value this one's
from<00:02:01.560> Whole<00:02:01.799> Foods<00:02:01.829> and<00:02:02.549> this<00:02:03.180> one's<00:02:03.360> a<00:02:03.450> whey

00:02:03.590 --> 00:02:03.600 
from Whole Foods and this one's a whey

00:02:03.600 --> 00:02:06.590 
from Whole Foods and this one's a whey
protein<00:02:04.110> powder<00:02:04.350> so<00:02:05.040> I<00:02:05.369> use<00:02:05.939> each<00:02:06.270> of<00:02:06.479> these

00:02:06.590 --> 00:02:06.600 
protein powder so I use each of these

00:02:06.600 --> 00:02:09.320 
protein powder so I use each of these
for<00:02:06.930> different<00:02:07.320> things<00:02:07.759> this<00:02:08.759> one<00:02:08.970> is<00:02:09.149> my

00:02:09.320 --> 00:02:09.330 
for different things this one is my

00:02:09.330 --> 00:02:12.260 
for different things this one is my
quick<00:02:09.660> on-the-go<00:02:10.289> protein<00:02:10.800> or<00:02:11.190> it's<00:02:11.760> for<00:02:12.030> when

00:02:12.260 --> 00:02:12.270 
quick on-the-go protein or it's for when

00:02:12.270 --> 00:02:12.860 
quick on-the-go protein or it's for when
I<00:02:12.330> makes

00:02:12.860 --> 00:02:12.870 
I makes

00:02:12.870 --> 00:02:15.920 
I makes
duties<00:02:13.140> that<00:02:13.440> don't<00:02:13.860> have<00:02:14.190> a<00:02:14.549> creamy<00:02:15.540> texture

00:02:15.920 --> 00:02:15.930 
duties that don't have a creamy texture

00:02:15.930 --> 00:02:18.350 
duties that don't have a creamy texture
to<00:02:16.019> it<00:02:16.170> so<00:02:16.440> say<00:02:16.650> if<00:02:16.769> I<00:02:16.860> make<00:02:17.069> a<00:02:17.099> veggies<00:02:17.549> veggie

00:02:18.350 --> 00:02:18.360 
to it so say if I make a veggies veggie

00:02:18.360 --> 00:02:20.420 
to it so say if I make a veggies veggie
and<00:02:18.569> berry<00:02:19.170> smoothies<00:02:19.769> but<00:02:19.920> I<00:02:20.040> still<00:02:20.250> want

00:02:20.420 --> 00:02:20.430 
and berry smoothies but I still want

00:02:20.430 --> 00:02:22.039 
and berry smoothies but I still want
some<00:02:20.610> protein<00:02:21.000> supplementation<00:02:21.599> in<00:02:21.900> those

00:02:22.039 --> 00:02:22.049 
some protein supplementation in those

00:02:22.049 --> 00:02:25.039 
some protein supplementation in those
smoothies<00:02:22.440> I<00:02:22.650> turn<00:02:23.220> to<00:02:23.340> this<00:02:23.459> one<00:02:23.730> it<00:02:24.120> it<00:02:24.750> does

00:02:25.039 --> 00:02:25.049 
smoothies I turn to this one it it does

00:02:25.049 --> 00:02:26.930 
smoothies I turn to this one it it does
say<00:02:25.230> natural<00:02:25.500> vanilla<00:02:25.890> flavor<00:02:26.400> but<00:02:26.819> it

00:02:26.930 --> 00:02:26.940 
say natural vanilla flavor but it

00:02:26.940 --> 00:02:30.910 
say natural vanilla flavor but it
doesn't<00:02:27.299> have<00:02:27.480> a<00:02:27.840> overly<00:02:28.709> sweet<00:02:29.220> creamy<00:02:29.849> a

00:02:30.910 --> 00:02:30.920 
doesn't have a overly sweet creamy a

00:02:30.920 --> 00:02:34.009 
doesn't have a overly sweet creamy a
milky<00:02:31.920> flavor<00:02:32.159> like<00:02:32.760> this<00:02:33.209> lean<00:02:33.510> dessert<00:02:33.840> one

00:02:34.009 --> 00:02:34.019 
milky flavor like this lean dessert one

00:02:34.019 --> 00:02:36.710 
milky flavor like this lean dessert one
has<00:02:34.200> this<00:02:34.769> one<00:02:34.980> I<00:02:35.010> use<00:02:35.340> with<00:02:35.549> 2%<00:02:36.090> milk<00:02:36.299> to<00:02:36.569> make

00:02:36.710 --> 00:02:36.720 
has this one I use with 2% milk to make

00:02:36.720 --> 00:02:38.330 
has this one I use with 2% milk to make
smoothies<00:02:37.140> and<00:02:37.349> things<00:02:37.560> like<00:02:37.739> that<00:02:37.799> that<00:02:38.069> are

00:02:38.330 --> 00:02:38.340 
smoothies and things like that that are

00:02:38.340 --> 00:02:41.479 
smoothies and things like that that are
creamy<00:02:38.640> and<00:02:38.970> this<00:02:39.599> one<00:02:39.810> I<00:02:39.840> use<00:02:40.140> for<00:02:40.170> my<00:02:41.159> shaker

00:02:41.479 --> 00:02:41.489 
creamy and this one I use for my shaker

00:02:41.489 --> 00:02:43.130 
creamy and this one I use for my shaker
cup<00:02:41.819> if<00:02:42.030> I'm<00:02:42.180> trying<00:02:42.390> to<00:02:42.450> down<00:02:42.659> some<00:02:42.959> really

00:02:43.130 --> 00:02:43.140 
cup if I'm trying to down some really

00:02:43.140 --> 00:02:45.110 
cup if I'm trying to down some really
quick<00:02:43.440> I<00:02:43.590> drink<00:02:43.829> this<00:02:43.920> with<00:02:44.099> water<00:02:44.400> this<00:02:45.060> is

00:02:45.110 --> 00:02:45.120 
quick I drink this with water this is

00:02:45.120 --> 00:02:47.930 
quick I drink this with water this is
what<00:02:45.390> blends<00:02:46.200> with<00:02:46.500> water<00:02:46.829> like<00:02:47.370> a<00:02:47.609> dream

00:02:47.930 --> 00:02:47.940 
what blends with water like a dream

00:02:47.940 --> 00:02:50.180 
what blends with water like a dream
whereas<00:02:48.660> this<00:02:48.870> one<00:02:49.109> it's<00:02:49.319> not<00:02:49.500> going<00:02:49.829> to<00:02:49.950> blend

00:02:50.180 --> 00:02:50.190 
whereas this one it's not going to blend

00:02:50.190 --> 00:02:51.650 
whereas this one it's not going to blend
with<00:02:50.310> water<00:02:50.579> so<00:02:50.849> well<00:02:51.060> because<00:02:51.269> it<00:02:51.420> is<00:02:51.629> a

00:02:51.650 --> 00:02:51.660 
with water so well because it is a

00:02:51.660 --> 00:02:54.170 
with water so well because it is a
little<00:02:51.900> more<00:02:51.989> creamy<00:02:52.379> it<00:02:53.160> would<00:02:53.400> go<00:02:53.609> pretty

00:02:54.170 --> 00:02:54.180 
little more creamy it would go pretty

00:02:54.180 --> 00:02:55.940 
little more creamy it would go pretty
much<00:02:54.239> better<00:02:54.540> with<00:02:54.720> milk<00:02:54.959> and<00:02:55.200> stuff<00:02:55.470> so<00:02:55.920> I

00:02:55.940 --> 00:02:55.950 
much better with milk and stuff so I

00:02:55.950 --> 00:02:57.770 
much better with milk and stuff so I
just<00:02:56.190> use<00:02:56.430> this<00:02:56.640> when<00:02:56.879> I<00:02:56.910> make<00:02:57.150> my<00:02:57.359> sweet

00:02:57.770 --> 00:02:57.780 
just use this when I make my sweet

00:02:57.780 --> 00:02:59.960 
just use this when I make my sweet
protein<00:02:58.319> smoothies<00:02:58.769> and<00:02:58.950> I<00:02:59.370> use<00:02:59.549> this<00:02:59.760> one

00:02:59.960 --> 00:02:59.970 
protein smoothies and I use this one

00:02:59.970 --> 00:03:01.580 
protein smoothies and I use this one
like<00:03:00.150> I<00:03:00.299> said<00:03:00.540> when<00:03:00.720> I<00:03:00.750> make<00:03:01.019> a<00:03:01.049> more<00:03:01.319> fresh

00:03:01.580 --> 00:03:01.590 
like I said when I make a more fresh

00:03:01.590 --> 00:03:03.890 
like I said when I make a more fresh
smoothie<00:03:02.040> that<00:03:02.220> you<00:03:03.180> don't<00:03:03.359> want<00:03:03.540> to<00:03:03.629> taste

00:03:03.890 --> 00:03:03.900 
smoothie that you don't want to taste

00:03:03.900 --> 00:03:06.440 
smoothie that you don't want to taste
the<00:03:04.109> creaminess<00:03:04.620> or<00:03:04.829> the<00:03:04.980> chalkiness<00:03:05.459> of<00:03:05.819> the

00:03:06.440 --> 00:03:06.450 
the creaminess or the chalkiness of the

00:03:06.450 --> 00:03:10.479 
the creaminess or the chalkiness of the
protein<00:03:06.870> so<00:03:07.560> I<00:03:07.590> really<00:03:07.980> like<00:03:08.159> this<00:03:08.370> one<00:03:08.549> it's<00:03:09.540> a

00:03:10.479 --> 00:03:10.489 
protein so I really like this one it's a

00:03:10.489 --> 00:03:13.550 
protein so I really like this one it's a
ion-exchange<00:03:11.489> micro<00:03:12.450> filtered<00:03:12.870> hydrolyzed

00:03:13.550 --> 00:03:13.560 
ion-exchange micro filtered hydrolyzed

00:03:13.560 --> 00:03:16.670 
ion-exchange micro filtered hydrolyzed
pretty<00:03:14.430> much<00:03:14.579> there's<00:03:14.819> only<00:03:15.030> has<00:03:15.180> 16<00:03:16.019> grams<00:03:16.349> of

00:03:16.670 --> 00:03:16.680 
pretty much there's only has 16 grams of

00:03:16.680 --> 00:03:19.339 
pretty much there's only has 16 grams of
protein<00:03:17.220> per<00:03:17.459> serving<00:03:18.030> it's<00:03:18.630> not<00:03:18.840> as<00:03:18.959> much<00:03:19.169> as

00:03:19.339 --> 00:03:19.349 
protein per serving it's not as much as

00:03:19.349 --> 00:03:21.379 
protein per serving it's not as much as
the<00:03:19.440> other<00:03:19.620> one<00:03:19.859> but<00:03:20.519> it<00:03:20.790> only<00:03:20.910> has<00:03:21.120> 80

00:03:21.379 --> 00:03:21.389 
the other one but it only has 80

00:03:21.389 --> 00:03:23.780 
the other one but it only has 80
calories<00:03:21.720> so<00:03:22.560> if<00:03:22.739> you're<00:03:22.859> trying<00:03:23.099> to<00:03:23.160> if

00:03:23.780 --> 00:03:23.790 
calories so if you're trying to if

00:03:23.790 --> 00:03:25.640 
calories so if you're trying to if
you're<00:03:23.970> trying<00:03:24.209> to<00:03:24.239> down<00:03:24.450> some<00:03:24.720> protein<00:03:25.440> right

00:03:25.640 --> 00:03:25.650 
you're trying to down some protein right

00:03:25.650 --> 00:03:27.949 
you're trying to down some protein right
after<00:03:25.919> you<00:03:26.040> leave<00:03:26.220> the<00:03:26.370> gym<00:03:26.609> this<00:03:27.510> is<00:03:27.569> a<00:03:27.720> really

00:03:27.949 --> 00:03:27.959 
after you leave the gym this is a really

00:03:27.959 --> 00:03:29.569 
after you leave the gym this is a really
good<00:03:28.109> one<00:03:28.230> just<00:03:28.440> to<00:03:28.530> mix<00:03:28.739> with<00:03:28.919> water<00:03:29.220> the

00:03:29.569 --> 00:03:29.579 
good one just to mix with water the

00:03:29.579 --> 00:03:33.140 
good one just to mix with water the
texture<00:03:30.090> is<00:03:30.269> really<00:03:30.720> really<00:03:31.200> fine<00:03:31.590> powder<00:03:32.150> let

00:03:33.140 --> 00:03:33.150 
texture is really really fine powder let

00:03:33.150 --> 00:03:38.599 
texture is really really fine powder let
me<00:03:33.239> show<00:03:33.450> you<00:03:33.510> guys<00:03:33.599> how<00:03:34.049> I<00:03:34.079> X<00:03:37.099> so<00:03:38.099> if<00:03:38.280> you<00:03:38.310> look

00:03:38.599 --> 00:03:38.609 
me show you guys how I X so if you look

00:03:38.609 --> 00:03:40.789 
me show you guys how I X so if you look
really<00:03:38.819> closely<00:03:39.299> you<00:03:40.079> can<00:03:40.230> tell<00:03:40.290> that<00:03:40.650> the

00:03:40.789 --> 00:03:40.799 
really closely you can tell that the

00:03:40.799 --> 00:03:44.119 
really closely you can tell that the
texture<00:03:41.310> is<00:03:41.870> kind<00:03:42.870> of<00:03:43.019> different<00:03:43.440> than<00:03:43.709> other

00:03:44.119 --> 00:03:44.129 
texture is kind of different than other

00:03:44.129 --> 00:03:47.720 
texture is kind of different than other
proteins<00:03:44.699> that<00:03:44.760> I<00:03:44.849> have<00:03:45.090> seen<00:03:45.329> before<00:03:46.519> it's<00:03:47.519> a

00:03:47.720 --> 00:03:47.730 
proteins that I have seen before it's a

00:03:47.730 --> 00:03:51.020 
proteins that I have seen before it's a
really<00:03:48.090> really<00:03:48.480> fine<00:03:48.840> fine<00:03:49.379> powder<00:03:49.769> and<00:03:50.129> it's

00:03:51.020 --> 00:03:51.030 
really really fine fine powder and it's

00:03:51.030 --> 00:03:54.830 
really really fine fine powder and it's
not<00:03:51.480> as<00:03:52.040> it<00:03:53.040> looks<00:03:53.280> a<00:03:53.400> little<00:03:53.489> more<00:03:53.760> chalky<00:03:54.120> but

00:03:54.830 --> 00:03:54.840 
not as it looks a little more chalky but

00:03:54.840 --> 00:03:57.650 
not as it looks a little more chalky but
when<00:03:55.019> you<00:03:55.139> mix<00:03:55.410> this<00:03:55.680> with<00:03:56.010> water<00:03:56.040> it<00:03:56.730> blends

00:03:57.650 --> 00:03:57.660 
when you mix this with water it blends

00:03:57.660 --> 00:03:59.360 
when you mix this with water it blends
perfectly<00:03:57.840> you<00:03:58.769> don't<00:03:58.919> have<00:03:59.069> to<00:03:59.220> worry<00:03:59.340> about

00:03:59.360 --> 00:03:59.370 
perfectly you don't have to worry about

00:03:59.370 --> 00:04:01.400 
perfectly you don't have to worry about
any<00:03:59.669> chunks<00:04:00.269> or<00:04:00.389> anything<00:04:00.599> like<00:04:00.900> that<00:04:00.959> so

00:04:01.400 --> 00:04:01.410 
any chunks or anything like that so

00:04:01.410 --> 00:04:03.530 
any chunks or anything like that so
that's<00:04:01.859> why<00:04:02.040> I<00:04:02.099> really<00:04:02.370> like<00:04:02.579> this<00:04:02.790> one<00:04:03.060> so<00:04:03.120> I

00:04:03.530 --> 00:04:03.540 
that's why I really like this one so I

00:04:03.540 --> 00:04:05.479 
that's why I really like this one so I
have<00:04:03.870> each<00:04:04.169> of<00:04:04.379> these<00:04:04.560> I<00:04:04.769> use<00:04:04.949> them<00:04:05.099> both<00:04:05.220> for

00:04:05.479 --> 00:04:05.489 
have each of these I use them both for

00:04:05.489 --> 00:04:07.640 
have each of these I use them both for
different<00:04:05.579> things<00:04:06.030> like<00:04:06.269> I<00:04:06.480> said<00:04:06.780> but<00:04:07.319> these

00:04:07.640 --> 00:04:07.650 
different things like I said but these

00:04:07.650 --> 00:04:09.349

are<00:04:07.799> my<00:04:07.919> two<00:04:07.980> favorite<00:04:08.489> protein<00:04:08.849> supplements

00:04:09.349 --> 00:04:09.359 
are my two favorite protein supplements

00:04:09.359 --> 00:04:10.729 
are my two favorite protein supplements
for<00:04:09.449> women<00:04:09.569> that<00:04:09.900> aren't<00:04:10.019> too<00:04:10.199> expensive

this one was $22 and I got this one from

00:04:13.470 --> 00:04:15.439 
this one was $22 and I got this one from
Dick's<00:04:13.739> pouring<00:04:14.220> mint<00:04:14.430> and<00:04:14.699> they<00:04:15.150> have<00:04:15.269> other

chocolate<00:04:19.199> cake<00:04:19.229> I<00:04:19.650> think<00:04:19.709> just<00:04:20.190> a<00:04:20.310> lot<00:04:20.549> of

00:04:20.569 --> 00:04:20.579 
chocolate cake I think just a lot of

00:04:20.579 --> 00:04:22.730 
chocolate cake I think just a lot of
different<00:04:21.090> type<00:04:21.269> of<00:04:21.500> flavors<00:04:22.500> that<00:04:22.680> are

another thing that I'd like to talk to
you<00:04:35.509> guys<00:04:35.570> about<00:04:35.750> these<00:04:36.020> two<00:04:36.169> supplements<00:04:36.650> is

00:04:36.760 --> 00:04:36.770 
you guys about these two supplements is

00:04:36.770 --> 00:04:40.719 
you guys about these two supplements is
that<00:04:37.280> they<00:04:37.430> are<00:04:37.520> not<00:04:37.699> soy<00:04:38.530> protein<00:04:39.530> so<00:04:40.220> how

00:04:40.719 --> 00:04:40.729 
that they are not soy protein so how

00:04:40.729 --> 00:04:42.670 
that they are not soy protein so how
your<00:04:40.880> body<00:04:41.090> works<00:04:41.389> is<00:04:41.600> it<00:04:41.720> only<00:04:41.900> absorbs<00:04:42.440> so

00:04:42.670 --> 00:04:42.680 
your body works is it only absorbs so

00:04:42.680 --> 00:04:44.590 
your body works is it only absorbs so
much<00:04:42.860> protein<00:04:43.310> soy<00:04:43.970> protein<00:04:44.419> your<00:04:44.570> body

00:04:44.590 --> 00:04:44.600 
much protein soy protein your body

00:04:44.600 --> 00:04:46.360 
much protein soy protein your body
doesn't<00:04:45.050> absorb<00:04:45.470> as<00:04:45.680> much<00:04:45.889> of<00:04:45.949> the<00:04:46.220> soy

00:04:46.360 --> 00:04:46.370 
doesn't absorb as much of the soy

00:04:46.370 --> 00:04:48.580 
doesn't absorb as much of the soy
protein<00:04:46.430> as<00:04:46.970> it<00:04:47.210> does<00:04:47.389> the<00:04:47.570> whey<00:04:47.720> protein<00:04:48.199> so<00:04:48.380> I

00:04:48.580 --> 00:04:48.590 
protein as it does the whey protein so I

00:04:48.590 --> 00:04:52.629 
protein as it does the whey protein so I
always<00:04:49.009> opt<00:04:49.460> for<00:04:49.910> a<00:04:49.940> whey<00:04:50.180> protein<00:04:50.210> and<00:04:51.639> both

00:04:52.629 --> 00:04:52.639 
always opt for a whey protein and both

00:04:52.639 --> 00:04:55.540 
always opt for a whey protein and both
of<00:04:52.669> these<00:04:52.910> are<00:04:52.970> way<00:04:53.479> and<00:04:54.350> I<00:04:54.800> really<00:04:54.830> like<00:04:55.280> both

00:04:55.540 --> 00:04:55.550 
of these are way and I really like both

00:04:55.550 --> 00:04:57.999 
of these are way and I really like both
of<00:04:55.580> them<00:04:55.789> this<00:04:56.360> one<00:04:56.570> says<00:04:57.289> it's<00:04:57.530> specifically

00:04:57.999 --> 00:04:58.009 
of them this one says it's specifically

00:04:58.009 --> 00:05:00.550 
of them this one says it's specifically
for<00:04:58.130> weight<00:04:58.550> for<00:04:59.090> weight<00:04:59.300> management<00:04:59.560> this

00:05:00.550 --> 00:05:00.560 
for weight for weight management this

00:05:00.560 --> 00:05:03.850 
for weight for weight management this
one<00:05:00.830> is<00:05:01.190> more<00:05:02.180> of<00:05:02.509> a<00:05:02.780> mainstream<00:05:03.410> kind<00:05:03.710> of

00:05:03.850 --> 00:05:03.860 
one is more of a mainstream kind of

one is more of a mainstream kind of
brand<00:05:04.160> BSN<00:05:04.940> so<00:05:05.479> the<00:05:05.930> marketing<00:05:06.440> is<00:05:06.590> going<00:05:06.770> to

brand BSN so the marketing is going to

00:05:06.889 --> 00:05:08.650 
brand BSN so the marketing is going to
be<00:05:07.039> a<00:05:07.070> little<00:05:07.400> different<00:05:07.639> than<00:05:08.120> this<00:05:08.419> really
