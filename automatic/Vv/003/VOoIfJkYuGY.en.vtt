day<00:01:45.130> two<00:01:45.190> would<00:01:45.790> have<00:01:45.880> seven<00:01:46.240> stages<00:01:46.480> day

00:01:47.460 --> 00:01:47.470 
day two would have seven stages day

00:01:47.470 --> 00:01:49.620 
day two would have seven stages day
three<00:01:47.860> would<00:01:48.040> have<00:01:48.190> a<00:01:48.220> new<00:01:48.400> event<00:01:48.550> no<00:01:49.480> one

00:01:49.620 --> 00:01:49.630 
three would have a new event no one

00:01:49.630 --> 00:01:50.700 
three would have a new event no one
really<00:01:49.720> knows<00:01:49.870> what<00:01:50.080> it<00:01:50.200> is<00:01:50.260> but<00:01:50.440> I<00:01:50.500> can<00:01:50.620> show

00:01:50.700 --> 00:01:50.710 
really knows what it is but I can show

00:01:50.710 --> 00:01:51.840 
really knows what it is but I can show
you<00:01:50.770> this<00:01:50.860> picture<00:01:51.100> that<00:01:51.310> they<00:01:51.400> showed<00:01:51.610> here

00:01:51.840 --> 00:01:51.850 
you this picture that they showed here

00:01:51.850 --> 00:01:53.640 
you this picture that they showed here
so<00:01:52.120> someone<00:01:52.510> was<00:01:52.600> talking<00:01:52.750> about<00:01:52.990> generals<00:01:53.410> I

00:01:53.640 --> 00:01:53.650 
so someone was talking about generals I

00:01:53.650 --> 00:01:55.470 
so someone was talking about generals I
oh<00:01:53.680> so<00:01:54.430> it<00:01:54.550> could<00:01:54.700> be<00:01:54.730> that<00:01:54.850> I'll<00:01:55.240> be<00:01:55.330> pretty

00:01:55.470 --> 00:01:55.480 
oh so it could be that I'll be pretty

00:01:55.480 --> 00:01:58.560 
oh so it could be that I'll be pretty
sweet<00:01:55.690> and<00:01:55.810> then<00:01:56.020> day<00:01:56.260> for<00:01:56.620> stage<00:01:57.490> 7<00:01:57.940> day<00:01:58.240> 5

00:01:58.560 --> 00:01:58.570 
sweet and then day for stage 7 day 5

00:01:58.570 --> 00:02:00.570 
sweet and then day for stage 7 day 5
stage<00:01:59.110> 7<00:01:59.470> and<00:01:59.590> then<00:01:59.650> day<00:01:59.830> 6<00:02:00.130> probably<00:02:00.520> a

00:02:00.570 --> 00:02:00.580 
stage 7 and then day 6 probably a

00:02:00.580 --> 00:02:03.080 
stage 7 and then day 6 probably a
continuation<00:02:01.240> of<00:02:01.330> the<00:02:01.450> event

00:02:03.080 --> 00:02:03.090 
continuation of the event

00:02:03.090 --> 00:02:07.249 
continuation of the event
I<00:02:03.200> mean<00:02:04.200> it's<00:02:05.130> not<00:02:05.310> like<00:02:05.520> a<00:02:05.729> it's<00:02:06.570> it's<00:02:06.929> kind<00:02:07.170> of

00:02:07.249 --> 00:02:07.259 
I mean it's not like a it's it's kind of

00:02:07.259 --> 00:02:08.990 
I mean it's not like a it's it's kind of
cool<00:02:07.590> how<00:02:07.799> we<00:02:07.859> will<00:02:08.069> have<00:02:08.220> things<00:02:08.550> going<00:02:08.759> on

00:02:08.990 --> 00:02:09.000 
cool how we will have things going on

00:02:09.000 --> 00:02:13.150 
cool how we will have things going on
every<00:02:09.390> day<00:02:09.590> but<00:02:10.590> I<00:02:10.679> honestly<00:02:11.370> did<00:02:11.700> like<00:02:12.000> how

00:02:13.150 --> 00:02:13.160 
every day but I honestly did like how

00:02:13.160 --> 00:02:16.339 
every day but I honestly did like how
you<00:02:14.160> could<00:02:14.340> just<00:02:14.519> like<00:02:14.730> clear<00:02:15.599> map<00:02:15.900> then<00:02:16.230> do

00:02:16.339 --> 00:02:16.349 
you could just like clear map then do

00:02:16.349 --> 00:02:18.440 
you could just like clear map then do
that<00:02:16.379> chair<00:02:16.860> in<00:02:16.980> one<00:02:17.220> day<00:02:17.370> and<00:02:17.550> like<00:02:17.790> save<00:02:18.300> up

00:02:18.440 --> 00:02:18.450 
that chair in one day and like save up

00:02:18.450 --> 00:02:19.880 
that chair in one day and like save up
for<00:02:18.599> huge<00:02:18.840> upgrade<00:02:19.050> so<00:02:19.410> I<00:02:19.440> do<00:02:19.530> see<00:02:19.799> the

00:02:19.880 --> 00:02:19.890 
for huge upgrade so I do see the

00:02:19.890 --> 00:02:22.250 
for huge upgrade so I do see the
potential<00:02:20.220> for<00:02:20.519> it<00:02:20.640> harder<00:02:21.150> do<00:02:21.870> you<00:02:21.930> get<00:02:22.080> huge

00:02:22.250 --> 00:02:22.260 
potential for it harder do you get huge

00:02:22.260 --> 00:02:26.570 
potential for it harder do you get huge
upgrades<00:02:22.799> at<00:02:23.010> one<00:02:23.250> time<00:02:23.580> but<00:02:24.540> this<00:02:24.750> may<00:02:25.190> be<00:02:26.190> it

00:02:26.570 --> 00:02:26.580 
upgrades at one time but this may be it

00:02:26.580 --> 00:02:29.059 
upgrades at one time but this may be it
may<00:02:26.819> be<00:02:27.030> beneficial<00:02:27.390> to<00:02:27.840> because<00:02:28.319> one<00:02:28.620> tho<00:02:28.799> day

00:02:29.059 --> 00:02:29.069 
may be beneficial to because one tho day

00:02:29.069 --> 00:02:30.740 
may be beneficial to because one tho day
one<00:02:29.400> terror<00:02:29.700> stage<00:02:30.000> ends<00:02:30.239> and<00:02:30.420> goes<00:02:30.540> to<00:02:30.629> the

00:02:30.740 --> 00:02:30.750 
one terror stage ends and goes to the

00:02:30.750 --> 00:02:33.979 
one terror stage ends and goes to the
volcano<00:02:30.900> base<00:02:31.879> you<00:02:32.879> might<00:02:33.060> overlap<00:02:33.599> so<00:02:33.900> you

00:02:33.979 --> 00:02:33.989 
volcano base you might overlap so you

00:02:33.989 --> 00:02:36.289 
volcano base you might overlap so you
might<00:02:34.170> be<00:02:34.200> able<00:02:34.440> to<00:02:34.590> like<00:02:35.430> booster<00:02:35.819> statues

00:02:36.289 --> 00:02:36.299 
might be able to like booster statues

00:02:36.299 --> 00:02:38.390 
might be able to like booster statues
and<00:02:36.510> get<00:02:36.660> the<00:02:36.810> power<00:02:36.989> part<00:02:37.260> from<00:02:37.410> that<00:02:37.650> I<00:02:37.890> think

00:02:38.390 --> 00:02:38.400 
and get the power part from that I think

00:02:38.400 --> 00:02:39.559 
and get the power part from that I think
that<00:02:38.519> would<00:02:38.610> be<00:02:38.670> pretty<00:02:38.760> sweet<00:02:38.970> or<00:02:39.150> even<00:02:39.390> like

00:02:39.559 --> 00:02:39.569 
that would be pretty sweet or even like

00:02:39.569 --> 00:02:41.660 
that would be pretty sweet or even like
the<00:02:39.840> new<00:02:39.959> event<00:02:40.319> but<00:02:41.190> what<00:02:41.400> they<00:02:41.549> are

00:02:41.660 --> 00:02:41.670 
the new event but what they are

00:02:41.670 --> 00:02:44.120 
the new event but what they are
basically<00:02:42.030> saying<00:02:42.630> is<00:02:42.870> power<00:02:43.230> stone<00:02:43.560> chances

00:02:44.120 --> 00:02:44.130 
basically saying is power stone chances

00:02:44.130 --> 00:02:45.440 
basically saying is power stone chances
like<00:02:44.340> are<00:02:44.549> pretty<00:02:44.819> much<00:02:44.940> going<00:02:45.090> to<00:02:45.150> say<00:02:45.299> the

00:02:45.440 --> 00:02:45.450 
like are pretty much going to say the

00:02:45.450 --> 00:02:47.960 
like are pretty much going to say the
same<00:02:45.680> somehow<00:02:46.680> between<00:02:47.010> all<00:02:47.220> these<00:02:47.370> events<00:02:47.700> if

00:02:47.960 --> 00:02:47.970 
same somehow between all these events if

00:02:47.970 --> 00:02:51.910 
same somehow between all these events if
you<00:02:48.750> attack<00:02:49.079> all<00:02:49.290> of<00:02:49.440> them<00:02:49.620> I<00:02:49.709> assume<00:02:50.030> and

00:02:51.910 --> 00:02:51.920 
you attack all of them I assume and

00:02:51.920 --> 00:02:55.280 
you attack all of them I assume and
basically<00:02:52.920> they're<00:02:53.160> curving<00:02:53.610> the<00:02:53.640> loot<00:02:54.290> for

00:02:55.280 --> 00:02:55.290 
basically they're curving the loot for

00:02:55.290 --> 00:02:57.559 
basically they're curving the loot for
the<00:02:55.890> earlier<00:02:56.310> stages<00:02:56.610> so<00:02:56.940> the<00:02:57.030> earlier<00:02:57.299> stages

00:02:57.559 --> 00:02:57.569 
the earlier stages so the earlier stages

00:02:57.569 --> 00:03:00.170 
the earlier stages so the earlier stages
will<00:02:58.319> give<00:02:58.470> you<00:02:58.620> more<00:02:58.920> like<00:02:59.489> a<00:02:59.519> mist<00:02:59.819> new

00:03:00.170 --> 00:03:00.180 
will give you more like a mist new

00:03:00.180 --> 00:03:02.449 
will give you more like a mist new
proposed<00:03:00.540> plan<00:03:00.840> but<00:03:01.500> the<00:03:01.620> later<00:03:01.920> stages<00:03:02.220> will

00:03:02.449 --> 00:03:02.459 
proposed plan but the later stages will

00:03:02.459 --> 00:03:04.610 
proposed plan but the later stages will
give<00:03:02.579> you<00:03:02.670> less<00:03:02.910> but<00:03:03.870> another<00:03:04.200> thing<00:03:04.440> they<00:03:04.590> are

00:03:04.610 --> 00:03:04.620 
give you less but another thing they are

00:03:04.620 --> 00:03:06.589 
give you less but another thing they are
saying<00:03:04.920> is<00:03:05.190> this<00:03:05.400> is<00:03:05.459> if<00:03:06.209> you<00:03:06.420> guys<00:03:06.569> think

00:03:06.589 --> 00:03:06.599 
saying is this is if you guys think

00:03:06.599 --> 00:03:08.569 
saying is this is if you guys think
differently<00:03:07.230> but<00:03:07.560> I<00:03:07.620> think<00:03:07.859> this<00:03:07.950> is<00:03:08.010> correct

00:03:08.569 --> 00:03:08.579 
differently but I think this is correct

00:03:08.579 --> 00:03:12.860 
differently but I think this is correct
is<00:03:08.819> that<00:03:09.290> they<00:03:10.290> said<00:03:10.530> that<00:03:10.739> stage<00:03:11.400> 127<00:03:12.389> will<00:03:12.720> be

00:03:12.860 --> 00:03:12.870 
is that they said that stage 127 will be

00:03:12.870 --> 00:03:14.840 
is that they said that stage 127 will be
equivalent<00:03:13.560> to<00:03:13.739> the<00:03:13.980> doctor<00:03:14.370> terror<00:03:14.579> stage

00:03:14.840 --> 00:03:14.850 
equivalent to the doctor terror stage

00:03:14.850 --> 00:03:17.059 
equivalent to the doctor terror stage
now<00:03:15.090> that<00:03:15.329> we<00:03:15.450> have<00:03:15.480> from<00:03:15.930> the<00:03:16.109> 12<00:03:16.440> 20<00:03:16.769> so<00:03:16.950> that

00:03:17.059 --> 00:03:17.069 
now that we have from the 12 20 so that

00:03:17.069 --> 00:03:19.759 
now that we have from the 12 20 so that
means<00:03:17.310> they<00:03:17.910> one<00:03:18.150> day<00:03:18.359> to<00:03:18.420> day<00:03:19.200> four<00:03:19.530> and<00:03:19.560> a

00:03:19.759 --> 00:03:19.769 
means they one day to day four and a

00:03:19.769 --> 00:03:22.129 
means they one day to day four and a
five<00:03:20.209> hour<00:03:21.209> base<00:03:21.420> is<00:03:21.569> going<00:03:21.720> to<00:03:21.780> be<00:03:21.840> the

00:03:22.129 --> 00:03:22.139 
five hour base is going to be the

00:03:22.139 --> 00:03:25.520 
five hour base is going to be the
equivalent<00:03:22.410> to<00:03:22.769> taking<00:03:22.950> on<00:03:23.250> dr.<00:03:23.760> terror<00:03:24.530> it's

00:03:25.520 --> 00:03:25.530 
equivalent to taking on dr. terror it's

00:03:25.530 --> 00:03:27.949 
equivalent to taking on dr. terror it's
just<00:03:25.859> stage<00:03:26.069> 1<00:03:26.370> to<00:03:26.489> 20<00:03:26.819> so<00:03:27.630> from<00:03:27.930> my

00:03:27.949 --> 00:03:27.959 
just stage 1 to 20 so from my

00:03:27.959 --> 00:03:30.940 
just stage 1 to 20 so from my
understanding<00:03:28.200> is<00:03:28.889> we<00:03:29.220> have<00:03:29.549> to<00:03:29.609> take<00:03:29.819> on<00:03:30.000> for

00:03:30.940 --> 00:03:30.950 
understanding is we have to take on for

00:03:30.950 --> 00:03:34.729 
understanding is we have to take on for
stage<00:03:31.950> 20s<00:03:32.549> and<00:03:32.880> a<00:03:33.060> six<00:03:33.299> day<00:03:33.510> span<00:03:33.810> if<00:03:34.319> any<00:03:34.560> if

00:03:34.729 --> 00:03:34.739 
stage 20s and a six day span if any if

00:03:34.739 --> 00:03:36.470 
stage 20s and a six day span if any if
there's<00:03:35.459> any<00:03:35.579> confirmation<00:03:36.239> that<00:03:36.359> it's

00:03:36.470 --> 00:03:36.480 
there's any confirmation that it's

00:03:36.480 --> 00:03:38.920 
there's any confirmation that it's
different<00:03:36.870> like<00:03:37.019> stage<00:03:37.829> one<00:03:38.130> will<00:03:38.310> be<00:03:38.430> like

00:03:38.920 --> 00:03:38.930 
different like stage one will be like

00:03:38.930 --> 00:03:43.570 
different like stage one will be like
stage<00:03:40.579> the<00:03:41.579> first<00:03:41.970> ten<00:03:42.209> stages<00:03:42.480> and<00:03:42.810> then

00:03:43.570 --> 00:03:43.580 
stage the first ten stages and then

00:03:43.580 --> 00:03:46.580 
stage the first ten stages and then

00:03:51.620 --> 00:03:51.630 
it says day one is Tara Island the

00:03:51.630 --> 00:03:54.470 
it says day one is Tara Island the
regular<00:03:51.990> base<00:03:52.200> and<00:03:52.530> then<00:03:53.010> day<00:03:53.310> for<00:03:53.730> is<00:03:54.090> terrell

00:03:54.470 --> 00:03:54.480 
regular base and then day for is terrell

00:03:54.480 --> 00:03:57.740 
regular base and then day for is terrell
island<00:03:54.870> the<00:03:55.380> regular<00:03:56.010> base<00:03:56.160> again<00:03:56.550> so<00:03:57.210> is<00:03:57.360> it

00:03:57.740 --> 00:03:57.750 
island the regular base again so is it

00:03:57.750 --> 00:04:00.290 
island the regular base again so is it
like<00:03:58.590> I<00:03:59.040> don't<00:03:59.100> know<00:03:59.250> it's<00:03:59.460> either<00:03:59.610> but<00:03:59.880> is<00:04:00.030> day

00:04:00.290 --> 00:04:00.300 
like I don't know it's either but is day

00:04:00.300 --> 00:04:02.990 
like I don't know it's either but is day
one<00:04:00.630> going<00:04:00.930> to<00:04:01.020> be<00:04:01.170> the<00:04:01.770> first<00:04:02.040> ten<00:04:02.310> stages<00:04:02.550> and

00:04:02.990 --> 00:04:03.000 
one going to be the first ten stages and

00:04:03.000 --> 00:04:05.210 
one going to be the first ten stages and
then<00:04:03.120> Dave<00:04:03.360> or<00:04:03.660> going<00:04:03.990> to<00:04:04.050> be<00:04:04.110> the<00:04:04.230> 10<00:04:04.470> to<00:04:04.590> 20<00:04:05.040> I

00:04:05.210 --> 00:04:05.220 
then Dave or going to be the 10 to 20 I

00:04:05.220 --> 00:04:07.480 
then Dave or going to be the 10 to 20 I
think<00:04:05.760> that<00:04:05.880> might<00:04:06.060> be<00:04:06.090> a<00:04:06.210> better<00:04:06.390> option<00:04:06.540> but

00:04:07.480 --> 00:04:07.490 
think that might be a better option but

00:04:07.490 --> 00:04:09.800 
think that might be a better option but
it's<00:04:08.490> since<00:04:08.760> it's<00:04:08.940> only<00:04:09.060> me<00:04:09.300> seven<00:04:09.570> stages

00:04:09.800 --> 00:04:09.810 
it's since it's only me seven stages

00:04:09.810 --> 00:04:11.660 
it's since it's only me seven stages
it's<00:04:10.530> going<00:04:10.710> to<00:04:10.740> be<00:04:10.830> somewhat<00:04:11.250> nerfed<00:04:11.490> or

00:04:11.660 --> 00:04:11.670 
it's going to be somewhat nerfed or

00:04:11.670 --> 00:04:13.580 
it's going to be somewhat nerfed or
whatever<00:04:11.910> here<00:04:12.210> and<00:04:12.330> there<00:04:12.420> yeah<00:04:12.660> but<00:04:12.960> or<00:04:13.380> is

00:04:13.580 --> 00:04:13.590 
whatever here and there yeah but or is

00:04:13.590 --> 00:04:15.910 
whatever here and there yeah but or is
day<00:04:14.100> one<00:04:14.400> going<00:04:14.640> to<00:04:14.730> be<00:04:14.850> the<00:04:15.150> equivalent<00:04:15.360> to<00:04:15.720> a

00:04:15.910 --> 00:04:15.920 
day one going to be the equivalent to a

00:04:15.920 --> 00:04:19.460 
day one going to be the equivalent to a
12<00:04:16.920> 20<00:04:17.400> when<00:04:18.209> day<00:04:18.420> for<00:04:18.750> gonna<00:04:18.959> be<00:04:19.049> equivalent

00:04:19.460 --> 00:04:19.470 
12 20 when day for gonna be equivalent

00:04:19.470 --> 00:04:21.500 
12 20 when day for gonna be equivalent
to<00:04:19.500> a<00:04:19.620> 10<00:04:20.100> or<00:04:20.280> 12<00:04:20.700> 20<00:04:21.060> if<00:04:21.120> you<00:04:21.209> guys<00:04:21.330> can

00:04:21.500 --> 00:04:21.510 
to a 10 or 12 20 if you guys can

00:04:21.510 --> 00:04:23.390 
to a 10 or 12 20 if you guys can
understand<00:04:21.900> I'm<00:04:22.019> saying<00:04:22.260> like<00:04:22.470> so<00:04:23.130> it's<00:04:23.280> gonna

00:04:23.390 --> 00:04:23.400 
understand I'm saying like so it's gonna

00:04:23.400 --> 00:04:26.680 
understand I'm saying like so it's gonna
suck<00:04:23.670> if<00:04:23.850> we're<00:04:23.970> gonna<00:04:24.090> have<00:04:24.300> to<00:04:24.420> take<00:04:24.630> on<00:04:25.190> for

00:04:26.680 --> 00:04:26.690 
suck if we're gonna have to take on for

00:04:26.690 --> 00:04:30.230 
suck if we're gonna have to take on for
equivalent<00:04:27.690> basis<00:04:28.050> the<00:04:28.200> 12<00:04:28.440> 20<00:04:28.800> in<00:04:29.060> four<00:04:30.060> days

00:04:30.230 --> 00:04:30.240 
equivalent basis the 12 20 in four days

00:04:30.240 --> 00:04:32.540 
equivalent basis the 12 20 in four days
so<00:04:30.570> I<00:04:31.110> don't<00:04:31.710> know<00:04:31.800> that's<00:04:31.980> just<00:04:32.130> my<00:04:32.340> opinion

something<00:04:39.360> to<00:04:39.480> do<00:04:39.570> Hammerman<00:04:40.080> might<00:04:40.290> have

00:04:40.460 --> 00:04:40.470 
something to do Hammerman might have

00:04:40.470 --> 00:04:41.840 
something to do Hammerman might have
something<00:04:40.770> to<00:04:40.800> do<00:04:40.950> with<00:04:41.130> it<00:04:41.370> more<00:04:41.580> with<00:04:41.700> their

something to do with it more with their

00:04:41.850 --> 00:04:43.790 
something to do with it more with their
like<00:04:42.000> roboti<00:04:42.510> theme<00:04:42.960> like<00:04:43.140> the<00:04:43.350> kind<00:04:43.650> of<00:04:43.710> like

00:04:43.790 --> 00:04:43.800 
like roboti theme like the kind of like

00:04:43.800 --> 00:04:45.230 
like roboti theme like the kind of like
in<00:04:43.890> the<00:04:43.980> operations<00:04:44.580> I<00:04:44.760> don't<00:04:44.910> know<00:04:44.970> that'd<00:04:45.150> be

00:04:45.230 --> 00:04:45.240 
in the operations I don't know that'd be

00:04:45.240 --> 00:04:48.500 
in the operations I don't know that'd be
pretty<00:04:45.419> sweet<00:04:45.630> um<00:04:46.620> I<00:04:46.680> don't<00:04:47.310> I<00:04:47.910> think<00:04:48.390> it's

00:04:48.500 --> 00:04:48.510 
pretty sweet um I don't I think it's

00:04:48.510 --> 00:04:49.970 
pretty sweet um I don't I think it's
good<00:04:48.690> that<00:04:48.750> it'll<00:04:49.260> make<00:04:49.290> people<00:04:49.800> be<00:04:49.950> more

00:04:49.970 --> 00:04:49.980 
good that it'll make people be more

00:04:49.980 --> 00:04:53.060 
good that it'll make people be more
active<00:04:50.640> and<00:04:50.760> attack<00:04:51.290> but<00:04:52.290> I<00:04:52.320> do<00:04:52.620> see<00:04:52.950> the

00:04:53.060 --> 00:04:53.070 
active and attack but I do see the

00:04:53.070 --> 00:04:55.070 
active and attack but I do see the
potential<00:04:53.340> for<00:04:53.610> it<00:04:53.700> harder<00:04:54.030> being<00:04:54.630> harder<00:04:54.990> to

00:04:55.070 --> 00:04:55.080 
potential for it harder being harder to

00:04:55.080 --> 00:04:57.640 
potential for it harder being harder to
get<00:04:55.200> like<00:04:55.380> bigger<00:04:55.650> upgrades<00:04:56.100> at<00:04:56.250> a<00:04:56.280> time<00:04:56.610> um

00:04:57.640 --> 00:04:57.650 
get like bigger upgrades at a time um

00:04:57.650 --> 00:04:59.600 
get like bigger upgrades at a time um
