coming<00:00:33.030> out<00:00:33.180> up<00:00:33.420> here<00:00:36.739> next<00:00:37.739> way<00:00:38.040> we<00:00:38.250> have<00:00:38.430> a

00:00:38.450 --> 00:00:38.460 
coming out up here next way we have a

00:00:38.460 --> 00:00:40.819 
coming out up here next way we have a
tomato<00:00:39.059> plant<00:00:39.239> this<00:00:39.540> Roma<00:00:39.899> tomato<00:00:40.350> pan<00:00:40.649> was

00:00:40.819 --> 00:00:40.829 
tomato plant this Roma tomato pan was

00:00:40.829 --> 00:00:43.180 
tomato plant this Roma tomato pan was
actually<00:00:41.280> it's<00:00:42.210> actually<00:00:42.329> the<00:00:42.600> second<00:00:43.050> year

00:00:43.180 --> 00:00:43.190 
actually it's actually the second year

00:00:43.190 --> 00:00:47.660 
actually it's actually the second year
cropping<00:00:44.190> already<00:00:45.020> in<00:00:46.020> another<00:00:46.379> part<00:00:46.710> in<00:00:46.950> we

00:00:47.660 --> 00:00:47.670 
cropping already in another part in we

00:00:47.670 --> 00:00:53.119 
cropping already in another part in we
had<00:00:47.850> some<00:00:48.149> cucumbers<00:00:49.020> growing<00:00:49.260> here<00:00:52.129> with

00:00:53.119 --> 00:00:53.129 
had some cucumbers growing here with

00:00:53.129 --> 00:00:56.360 
had some cucumbers growing here with
remove<00:00:53.699> the<00:00:53.850> bottom<00:00:54.239> leaves<00:00:54.590> just<00:00:55.590> to<00:00:55.800> reduce

00:00:56.360 --> 00:00:56.370 
remove the bottom leaves just to reduce

00:00:56.370 --> 00:01:02.990 
remove the bottom leaves just to reduce
the<00:00:56.750> mutual<00:00:57.750> problem<00:00:59.629> and<00:01:00.629> also<00:01:01.199> some<00:01:02.000> bitter

00:01:02.990 --> 00:01:03.000 
the mutual problem and also some bitter

00:01:03.000 --> 00:01:06.830 
the mutual problem and also some bitter
melons<00:01:04.400> so<00:01:05.400> this<00:01:05.580> bitter<00:01:05.820> melon<00:01:06.150> is<00:01:06.299> directly

00:01:06.830 --> 00:01:06.840 
melons so this bitter melon is directly

00:01:06.840 --> 00:01:09.560 
melons so this bitter melon is directly
opposite<00:01:07.350> the<00:01:07.409> rock<00:01:08.250> melon

00:01:09.560 --> 00:01:09.570 
opposite the rock melon

00:01:09.570 --> 00:01:13.250 
opposite the rock melon
it's<00:01:10.500> coming<00:01:10.799> along<00:01:11.040> nicely<00:01:11.810> because<00:01:12.810> it's<00:01:13.140> in

00:01:13.250 --> 00:01:13.260 
it's coming along nicely because it's in

00:01:13.260 --> 00:01:15.830 
it's coming along nicely because it's in
the<00:01:13.380> greenhouse<00:01:14.100> is<00:01:14.490> not<00:01:14.970> a<00:01:15.000> lot<00:01:15.240> of<00:01:15.360> bees<00:01:15.570> or

00:01:15.830 --> 00:01:15.840 
the greenhouse is not a lot of bees or

00:01:15.840 --> 00:01:18.710 
the greenhouse is not a lot of bees or
insects<00:01:16.290> pollinating<00:01:16.979> it<00:01:17.100> so<00:01:17.310> we<00:01:17.610> do<00:01:18.090> have<00:01:18.450> to

00:01:18.710 --> 00:01:18.720 
insects pollinating it so we do have to

00:01:18.720 --> 00:01:22.520 
insects pollinating it so we do have to
hand<00:01:19.020> pollinate<00:01:19.320> them<00:01:20.840> meaning<00:01:21.840> picking<00:01:22.409> a

00:01:22.520 --> 00:01:22.530 
hand pollinate them meaning picking a

00:01:22.530 --> 00:01:24.469 
hand pollinate them meaning picking a
male<00:01:22.740> flower<00:01:23.040> and<00:01:23.400> going<00:01:23.580> to<00:01:23.670> the<00:01:23.790> female<00:01:24.240> and

00:01:24.469 --> 00:01:24.479 
male flower and going to the female and

00:01:24.479 --> 00:01:27.350 
male flower and going to the female and
a<00:01:24.630> pollinated<00:01:25.229> and<00:01:25.380> this<00:01:25.560> is<00:01:25.770> the<00:01:25.979> amaranth<00:01:26.520> we

00:01:27.350 --> 00:01:27.360 
a pollinated and this is the amaranth we

00:01:27.360 --> 00:01:33.380 
a pollinated and this is the amaranth we
hit<00:01:27.780> the<00:01:27.930> leaves<00:01:28.850> and<00:01:29.850> also<00:01:30.479> the<00:01:30.810> seats<00:01:32.390> this

00:01:33.380 --> 00:01:33.390 
hit the leaves and also the seats this

00:01:33.390 --> 00:01:35.149 
hit the leaves and also the seats this
has<00:01:33.570> been<00:01:33.780> you<00:01:34.290> know<00:01:34.409> providing<00:01:34.979> us

00:01:35.149 --> 00:01:35.159 
has been you know providing us

00:01:35.159 --> 00:01:37.810 
has been you know providing us
vegetables<00:01:36.150> for<00:01:36.360> the<00:01:36.509> last<00:01:36.720> four<00:01:37.290> months

00:01:37.810 --> 00:01:37.820 
vegetables for the last four months

00:01:37.820 --> 00:01:41.230 
vegetables for the last four months
capsicum<00:01:38.820> capsicum<00:01:39.479> this<00:01:40.049> is<00:01:40.200> the<00:01:40.350> third<00:01:40.619> year

00:01:41.230 --> 00:01:41.240 
capsicum capsicum this is the third year

00:01:41.240 --> 00:01:43.730 
capsicum capsicum this is the third year
capsicum<00:01:42.240> so<00:01:42.659> they<00:01:42.960> don't<00:01:43.140> actually<00:01:43.259> die<00:01:43.680> down

00:01:43.730 --> 00:01:43.740 
capsicum so they don't actually die down

00:01:43.740 --> 00:01:46.819 
capsicum so they don't actually die down
the<00:01:44.220> little<00:01:44.399> drop<00:01:45.149> and<00:01:45.420> what<00:01:46.320> we<00:01:46.439> do<00:01:46.560> is<00:01:46.680> we
