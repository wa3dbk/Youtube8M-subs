00:00:01.250 --> 00:00:04.250
 ana 

00:00:13.500 --> 00:00:23.180
 We explain the second goal of the World Cup Asian final qualifying Oman match 

00:00:18.600 --> 00:00:24.700
 It is three people who become points by the goal of Ekko 

00:00:23.180 --> 00:00:27.790
 Honda 

00:00:24.700 --> 00:00:33.130
 Kagawa and Maeda who made the goal 

00:00:27.790 --> 00:00:37.810
 These three people will be the first point I 'm starting from this kind of song 

00:00:33.130 --> 00:00:42.190
 Hasebe holds the ball and of course is solidified before the goal 

00:00:37.810 --> 00:00:44.690
 It is protected by about nine people, but there is not much space, but Honda has a lot of balls 

00:00:42.190 --> 00:00:50.780
 It was sweet to get 

00:00:44.690 --> 00:00:54.520
 I will receive the ball between the Defender receives pressure and I'm here 

00:00:50.780 --> 00:00:57.670
 I will return again in Hasebe and 

00:00:54.520 --> 00:01:04.750
 Little to receive between 

00:00:57.670 --> 00:01:09.280
 It moves to the other person's senior citizen in the direction of the goal, and of course if it is beaten once with pressure 

00:01:04.750 --> 00:01:12.490
 If so I'm become the hit the ball through you Honda is a disadvantage, but 

00:01:09.280 --> 00:01:16.380
 Take out the ball here in Hasebe without missing it 

00:01:12.490 --> 00:01:18.670
 Honda received the ball in good shape and 

00:01:16.380 --> 00:01:23.060
 I'm putting a ball in Kagawa 

00:01:18.670 --> 00:01:29.420
 So what's going on after this, Honda's wonderful place 

00:01:23.060 --> 00:01:33.720
 After hitting , Honda runs to get a ball in the space here . 

00:01:29.420 --> 00:01:35.070
 The defender had been attached to Honda by the 

00:01:33.720 --> 00:01:39.150
 Will be pulled 

00:01:35.070 --> 00:01:39.900
 And I can do a big space here, so this space was created by Honda 

00:01:39.150 --> 00:01:43.330
 is 

00:01:39.900 --> 00:01:48.550
 Kagawa takes this space 

00:01:43.330 --> 00:01:49.090
 Instead of giving Honda 5 passes to Honda, I use my own space created by Honda. 

00:01:48.550 --> 00:01:55.240
 Ne 

00:01:49.090 --> 00:01:58.750
 Kagawa cuts into the space there is a large space here Kagawa can do anything 

00:01:55.240 --> 00:02:05.890
 Have a ball in there and there 

00:01:58.750 --> 00:02:09.130
 This pass is very true with the right foot behind Oman's defense that kept the line high 

00:02:05.890 --> 00:02:14.080
 It's difficult It 's on the left 

00:02:09.130 --> 00:02:14.950
 That ball does not run away for Maeda, but if you kick the ball with your right foot 

00:02:14.080 --> 00:02:19.240
 Also why 

00:02:14.950 --> 00:02:22.720
 It is more difficult ball to run away towards the goalkeeper or goal line 

00:02:19.240 --> 00:02:25.810
 He has a very good speed with timing 

00:02:22.720 --> 00:02:29.710
 Timing course and speed 

00:02:25.810 --> 00:02:34.770
 I think everything was perfect but a great pass is now 

00:02:29.710 --> 00:02:39.720
 Maeda also jumped out in a good shape, but it jumped out at the last minute of the festival 

00:02:34.770 --> 00:02:43.200
 Be judged that say to do something to stop here as Foado guess I do not is the fact 

00:02:39.720 --> 00:02:47.370
 Here to that ball, which came into between the goal before the defender and the keeper 

00:02:43.200 --> 00:02:48.570
 Roughly the Maeda in do such things to come to aim a shot with one touch definitely a plate, etc. 

00:02:47.370 --> 00:02:53.860
 I aimed for a shot 

00:02:48.570 --> 00:02:57.810
 It is thought that trying to change course it is I went to Fall aim at the outside of the right foot 

00:02:53.860 --> 00:02:57.810
 Without hitting it well 

00:02:58.010 --> 00:03:07.360
 I made a mistake and I was connected to the control in a good way 

00:03:01.840 --> 00:03:12.700
 Well Nde ball has been rolling over here just to not stunning even providers 

00:03:07.360 --> 00:03:15.160
 I got a reaction and finally thrown out my body, but I hardly had a course, but I thrown out my body 

00:03:12.700 --> 00:03:21.549
 I think that was a good goal Te 

00:03:15.160 --> 00:03:21.860
 Certainly for Maeda it is a mistake at first, but those three are replaced well and several very 

00:03:21.549 --> 00:03:25.430
 fast 

00:03:21.860 --> 00:03:27.750
 I think that the fact that I got a reaction led to this goal 

00:03:25.430 --> 00:03:31.590
 In that sense 

00:03:27.750 --> 00:03:35.910
 Honda has not changed is the direct end of Rasutopasu and is the goal 

00:03:31.590 --> 00:03:39.240
 Honda's well received here and made a starting point, yet made space for this Honda 

00:03:35.910 --> 00:03:44.610
 Because we used movement and the space well 

00:03:39.240 --> 00:03:47.770
 And a good timing course and speed on the last pass and jumped there 

00:03:44.610 --> 00:03:52.840
 I made a mistake in Maeda , though 

00:03:47.770 --> 00:03:59.190
 It is Maeda's shot tied to the goal with the speed of the reaction afterwards 

00:03:52.840 --> 00:03:59.190
 I think it is a wonderful goal that these three people were born to work well 

00:04:04.960 --> 00:04:07.860
 Thank you
