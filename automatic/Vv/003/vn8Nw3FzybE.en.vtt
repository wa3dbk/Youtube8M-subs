00:00:13.280 --> 00:00:13.290 
in the Forgotten Shore on destiny for

00:00:13.290 --> 00:00:16.099 
in the Forgotten Shore on destiny for
the<00:00:13.349> ps4<00:00:13.700> now<00:00:14.700> I<00:00:15.150> don't<00:00:15.570> know<00:00:15.690> if<00:00:15.839> it's<00:00:15.960> the

00:00:16.099 --> 00:00:16.109 
the ps4 now I don't know if it's the

00:00:16.109 --> 00:00:18.349 
the ps4 now I don't know if it's the
same<00:00:16.139> for<00:00:16.350> the<00:00:17.220> Xbox<00:00:17.550> one<00:00:17.730> version<00:00:17.760> since<00:00:18.240> I

00:00:18.349 --> 00:00:18.359 
same for the Xbox one version since I

00:00:18.359 --> 00:00:20.480 
same for the Xbox one version since I
don't<00:00:18.420> own<00:00:18.690> the<00:00:18.810> Xbox<00:00:19.199> one<00:00:19.410> version<00:00:19.439> but<00:00:20.130> I

00:00:20.480 --> 00:00:20.490 
don't own the Xbox one version but I

00:00:20.490 --> 00:00:24.830 
don't own the Xbox one version but I
doubt<00:00:21.330> it's<00:00:21.600> really<00:00:21.840> that<00:00:22.020> much<00:00:22.170> different<00:00:23.840> so

00:00:24.830 --> 00:00:24.840 
doubt it's really that much different so

00:00:24.840 --> 00:00:26.810 
doubt it's really that much different so
basically<00:00:25.140> what<00:00:25.590> it<00:00:25.680> is<00:00:25.710> is<00:00:26.039> you're<00:00:26.400> going<00:00:26.670> to

00:00:26.810 --> 00:00:26.820 
basically what it is is you're going to

00:00:26.820 --> 00:00:29.300 
basically what it is is you're going to
move<00:00:27.449> in<00:00:27.599> a<00:00:27.689> circular<00:00:28.019> formation<00:00:28.590> around<00:00:28.920> the

00:00:29.300 --> 00:00:29.310 
move in a circular formation around the

00:00:29.310 --> 00:00:31.519 
move in a circular formation around the
island<00:00:29.760> and<00:00:29.880> checking<00:00:30.330> each<00:00:30.599> individual

00:00:31.519 --> 00:00:31.529 
island and checking each individual

00:00:31.529 --> 00:00:35.110 
island and checking each individual
tunnel<00:00:31.949> on<00:00:32.160> that<00:00:32.730> route<00:00:33.059> because<00:00:33.780> chests

00:00:35.110 --> 00:00:35.120 
tunnel on that route because chests

00:00:35.120 --> 00:00:37.790 
tunnel on that route because chests
respond<00:00:36.120> in<00:00:36.329> different<00:00:36.360> locations<00:00:37.260> all<00:00:37.530> the

00:00:37.790 --> 00:00:37.800 
respond in different locations all the

00:00:37.800 --> 00:00:40.700 
respond in different locations all the
time<00:00:38.040> and<00:00:38.399> it<00:00:39.270> really<00:00:39.450> has<00:00:39.660> a<00:00:39.690> really<00:00:40.410> short

00:00:40.700 --> 00:00:40.710 
time and it really has a really short

00:00:40.710 --> 00:00:44.119 
time and it really has a really short
respawn<00:00:41.700> rate<00:00:42.030> so<00:00:42.559> once<00:00:43.559> you're<00:00:43.770> done<00:00:44.070> the

00:00:44.119 --> 00:00:44.129 
respawn rate so once you're done the

00:00:44.129 --> 00:00:46.729 
respawn rate so once you're done the
loop<00:00:44.489> you'll<00:00:45.210> like<00:00:45.870> most<00:00:46.140> likely<00:00:46.500> have

00:00:46.729 --> 00:00:46.739 
loop you'll like most likely have

00:00:46.739 --> 00:00:48.709 
loop you'll like most likely have
another<00:00:47.129> chest<00:00:47.670> in<00:00:47.760> a<00:00:47.850> different<00:00:48.120> location

00:00:48.709 --> 00:00:48.719 
another chest in a different location

00:00:48.719 --> 00:00:52.549 
another chest in a different location
when<00:00:49.200> you<00:00:49.320> go<00:00:49.440> through<00:00:49.469> that<00:00:49.680> route<00:00:50.010> again<00:00:51.559> so

00:00:52.549 --> 00:00:52.559 
when you go through that route again so

00:00:52.559 --> 00:00:54.500 
when you go through that route again so
without<00:00:52.920> further<00:00:53.190> ado<00:00:53.610> I'm<00:00:53.940> gonna<00:00:54.239> show<00:00:54.449> you

side<00:01:06.750> there's<00:01:06.960> going<00:01:07.080> to<00:01:07.140> be<00:01:07.200> another<00:01:07.530> tunnel

00:01:14.180 --> 00:01:14.190 

00:01:14.190 --> 00:01:16.910 

as<00:01:14.610> you<00:01:15.600> can<00:01:15.720> see<00:01:15.900> we<00:01:16.080> already<00:01:16.320> found<00:01:16.470> it<00:01:16.680> just

as you can see we already found it just

00:01:16.920 --> 00:01:23.180 
as you can see we already found it just
here<00:01:21.350> okay<00:01:22.350> so<00:01:22.410> now<00:01:22.620> we're<00:01:22.770> gonna<00:01:22.830> head<00:01:23.010> across

00:01:23.180 --> 00:01:23.190 
here okay so now we're gonna head across

00:01:23.190 --> 00:01:24.890 
here okay so now we're gonna head across
the<00:01:23.310> water<00:01:23.610> and<00:01:23.940> we're<00:01:24.240> gonna<00:01:24.300> head<00:01:24.540> towards

00:01:24.890 --> 00:01:24.900 
the water and we're gonna head towards

00:01:24.900 --> 00:01:27.110 
the water and we're gonna head towards
this<00:01:25.080> walled<00:01:25.500> area<00:01:26.040> over<00:01:26.460> here<00:01:26.700> with<00:01:26.880> all<00:01:27.000> the

00:01:27.110 --> 00:01:27.120 
this walled area over here with all the

00:01:27.120 --> 00:01:30.020 
this walled area over here with all the
ledges<00:01:27.510> and<00:01:28.040> this<00:01:29.040> area<00:01:29.280> has<00:01:29.550> the<00:01:29.580> highest

00:01:30.020 --> 00:01:30.030 
ledges and this area has the highest

00:01:30.030 --> 00:01:32.000 
ledges and this area has the highest
chance<00:01:30.090> of<00:01:30.330> spawning<00:01:30.600> a<00:01:30.780> chest<00:01:31.020> because<00:01:31.440> it

00:01:32.000 --> 00:01:32.010 
chance of spawning a chest because it

00:01:32.010 --> 00:01:33.290 
chance of spawning a chest because it
has<00:01:32.160> a<00:01:32.190> chance<00:01:32.430> of<00:01:32.580> spawning<00:01:32.790> and<00:01:33.000> I<00:01:33.060> believe

00:01:33.290 --> 00:01:33.300 
has a chance of spawning and I believe

00:01:33.300 --> 00:01:34.610 
has a chance of spawning and I believe
like<00:01:33.450> six<00:01:33.690> different<00:01:33.780> or<00:01:34.080> seven<00:01:34.290> different

00:01:34.610 --> 00:01:34.620 
like six different or seven different

00:01:34.620 --> 00:01:40.580 
like six different or seven different
locations<00:01:34.860> on<00:01:35.580> this<00:01:36.390> wall<00:01:38.150> so<00:01:39.150> make<00:01:39.990> sure<00:01:40.020> you

00:01:40.580 --> 00:01:40.590 
locations on this wall so make sure you

00:01:40.590 --> 00:01:42.650 
locations on this wall so make sure you
you<00:01:41.010> check<00:01:41.400> this<00:01:41.610> wall<00:01:41.880> thoroughly<00:01:42.450> before

00:01:42.650 --> 00:01:42.660 
you check this wall thoroughly before

00:01:42.660 --> 00:01:46.550 
you check this wall thoroughly before
moving<00:01:43.110> on<00:01:44.030> so<00:01:45.030> after<00:01:45.690> you're<00:01:46.050> done<00:01:46.110> checking

moving on so after you're done checking

00:01:46.560 --> 00:01:48.500 
moving on so after you're done checking
the<00:01:46.920> walled<00:01:47.130> area<00:01:47.370> you're<00:01:47.940> gonna<00:01:48.060> go<00:01:48.300> down

00:01:48.500 --> 00:01:48.510 
the walled area you're gonna go down

00:01:48.510 --> 00:01:52.730 
the walled area you're gonna go down
here<00:01:49.970> on<00:01:50.970> this<00:01:51.540> ramp<00:01:51.870> and<00:01:52.110> you're<00:01:52.440> gonna<00:01:52.530> make

00:01:54.470 --> 00:01:54.480 
a right and the next tunnel is gonna

00:01:54.480 --> 00:01:55.700 
a right and the next tunnel is gonna
have<00:01:54.660> enemies<00:01:55.050> in<00:01:55.080> front<00:01:55.410> of<00:01:55.470> it<00:01:55.590> so<00:01:55.680> be
