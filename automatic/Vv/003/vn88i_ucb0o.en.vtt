00:02:23.250 --> 00:02:23.260 
that's in the future so it's not dated

00:02:36.010 --> 00:02:37.530 
think that we can we appeal to various
generations<00:02:36.430> because<00:02:36.850> little<00:02:37.150> kids<00:02:37.209> can

00:02:37.530 --> 00:02:37.540 
generations because little kids can

00:02:37.540 --> 00:02:38.940
