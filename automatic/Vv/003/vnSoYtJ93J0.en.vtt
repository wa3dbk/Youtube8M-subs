00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.650
 hello and happy new year to everything for this 

00:00:02.340 --> 00:00:06.600
 first panic nail art of 2014 I'm going 

00:00:04.650 --> 00:00:08.490
 show you how to make this ribbon 

00:00:06.600 --> 00:00:10.820
 with just two polishes and one 

00:00:08.490 --> 00:00:10.820
 needle 

00:00:12.469 --> 00:00:18.359
 so I first laid the base in one 

00:00:15.690 --> 00:00:19.830
 pink layer 2nd cosmetics then I 

00:00:18.359 --> 00:00:21.689
 am going to use this red varnish which you 

00:00:19.830 --> 00:00:23.789
 need only two polish that is 

00:00:21.689 --> 00:00:25.289
 enough colors to separate so I 'll tell you 

00:00:23.789 --> 00:00:27.240
 then lay the second layer of 

00:00:25.289 --> 00:00:28.349
 varnish I put it in a pretty 

00:00:27.240 --> 00:00:30.240
 thick there you see I'm going in 

00:00:28.349 --> 00:00:32.610
 to add three times is still necessary 

00:00:30.240 --> 00:00:34.469
 it's pretty thick so if your nail polish 

00:00:32.610 --> 00:00:35.700
 is very very liquid it is not too 

00:00:34.469 --> 00:00:38.190
 worked on the shield a texture 

00:00:35.700 --> 00:00:39.809
 normal then directly with the 

00:00:38.190 --> 00:00:42.000
 brush of the other polish I'm going 

00:00:39.809 --> 00:00:43.140
 draw like that a trait not very well 

00:00:42.000 --> 00:00:45.180
 do not care a bit 

00:00:43.140 --> 00:00:47.100
 and there I see between the pen that 

00:00:45.180 --> 00:00:48.420
 exist or can be made in 

00:00:47.100 --> 00:00:49.920
 does it's like a criterium 

00:00:48.420 --> 00:00:51.210
 except that instead that is a mine of 

00:00:49.920 --> 00:00:53.489
 pencil it's just a 

00:00:51.210 --> 00:00:54.870
 needle also you have it not you 

00:00:53.489 --> 00:00:56.280
 can of course take the pearls 

00:00:54.870 --> 00:00:59.180
 classics as I'm going to show you 

00:00:56.280 --> 00:01:02.370
 here and then with this pin 

00:00:59.180 --> 00:01:04.949
 we are going to make lots of little ones 

00:01:02.370 --> 00:01:08.010
 eggs to make curls in fact the 

00:01:04.949 --> 00:01:09.570
 lan of secrecy so we wait especially not 

00:01:08.010 --> 00:01:11.010
 that it's dry you have to do all the 

00:01:09.570 --> 00:01:12.689
 steps that I showed you so the 

00:01:11.010 --> 00:01:14.939
 post of the second layer laying the 

00:01:12.689 --> 00:01:16.710
 red varnish and loops one does it 

00:01:14.939 --> 00:01:18.540
 in the wake do not get dry 

00:01:16.710 --> 00:01:20.670
 otherwise the varnish will become pasty this 

00:01:18.540 --> 00:01:23.009
 will be impossible to do so there I 

00:01:20.670 --> 00:01:24.550
 scratch my angle so I touch with 

00:01:23.009 --> 00:01:26.680
 pin I touch 

00:01:24.550 --> 00:01:30.760
 my nail actually should not hesitate to 

00:01:26.680 --> 00:01:32.860
 press and then I added a few 

00:01:30.760 --> 00:01:34.090
 small dots oddo thing toolbox or if 

00:01:32.860 --> 00:01:35.770
 you do not have any you can take a 

00:01:34.090 --> 00:01:37.450
 toothpick or even remake with the 

00:01:35.770 --> 00:01:39.370
 needles to make poems with the 

00:01:37.450 --> 00:01:41.470
 varnish and that's so it's over 

00:01:39.370 --> 00:01:43.270
 it's super quick to do and there 

00:01:41.470 --> 00:01:45.610
 really you need almost 

00:01:43.270 --> 00:01:46.420
 nothing like material just two colors 

00:01:45.610 --> 00:01:48.070
 they are matched 

00:01:46.420 --> 00:01:49.720
 I hope you like this idea 

00:01:48.070 --> 00:01:51.190
 do not hesitate to always show me your 

00:01:49.720 --> 00:01:52.120
 creations on facebook that makes me 

00:01:51.190 --> 00:01:54.070
 pleasure to see them 

00:01:52.120 --> 00:01:55.810
 I give you an appointment Friday 

00:01:54.070 --> 00:01:58.320

00:01:55.810 --> 00:01:58.320
