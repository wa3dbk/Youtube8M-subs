cleaning<00:04:02.570> equipment<00:04:03.380> I<00:04:04.120> believe<00:04:05.120> this<00:04:05.300> is

00:04:05.440 --> 00:04:05.450 
cleaning equipment I believe this is

00:04:05.450 --> 00:04:06.970 
cleaning equipment I believe this is
what<00:04:05.570> you<00:04:05.690> use<00:04:05.780> to<00:04:05.810> clean<00:04:06.290> your<00:04:06.470> cartridges
