00:06:29.379 --> 00:06:29.389 
like Mario Land 2 it doesn't dig you

00:06:29.389 --> 00:06:32.320 
like Mario Land 2 it doesn't dig you
back<00:06:29.539> to<00:06:29.629> the<00:06:29.689> title<00:06:30.050> screen<00:06:30.169> newer<00:06:31.129> games<00:06:31.459> are

00:06:32.320 --> 00:06:32.330 
back to the title screen newer games are

00:06:32.330 --> 00:06:35.169 
back to the title screen newer games are
doing<00:06:32.599> this<00:06:32.749> now<00:06:32.959> well<00:06:33.679> some<00:06:34.369> of<00:06:34.399> them<00:06:34.580> and<00:06:34.729> I

00:06:35.169 --> 00:06:35.179 
doing this now well some of them and I

00:06:35.179 --> 00:06:36.549 
doing this now well some of them and I
think<00:06:35.389> it<00:06:35.449> should<00:06:35.599> be<00:06:35.659> standard<00:06:36.169> that<00:06:36.349> all

00:06:36.549 --> 00:06:36.559 
think it should be standard that all

00:06:36.559 --> 00:06:38.259 
think it should be standard that all
games<00:06:36.860> once<00:06:37.189> they<00:06:37.339> finish<00:06:37.669> take<00:06:37.939> you<00:06:38.029> back<00:06:38.179> to

00:06:38.259 --> 00:06:38.269 
games once they finish take you back to

00:06:38.269 --> 00:06:40.359 
games once they finish take you back to
the<00:06:38.300> title<00:06:38.629> screen<00:06:38.779> in<00:06:39.769> case<00:06:39.979> someone<00:06:40.249> wants

00:06:40.359 --> 00:06:40.369 
the title screen in case someone wants

00:06:40.369 --> 00:06:42.579 
the title screen in case someone wants
to<00:06:40.519> play<00:06:40.699> again<00:06:40.939> I<00:06:41.209> thought<00:06:42.139> anyone<00:06:42.379> won't

ups<00:06:58.230> for<00:06:58.440> Game<00:06:58.590> Boy<00:06:58.770> were<00:06:58.890> much<00:06:59.070> better<00:06:59.750> this

00:07:00.740 --> 00:07:00.750 
ups for Game Boy were much better this

00:07:00.750 --> 00:07:02.960

one<00:07:01.020> was<00:07:01.200> just<00:07:01.500> kind<00:07:02.160> of<00:07:02.220> frustrating<00:07:02.820> and

00:07:02.960 --> 00:07:02.970 
one was just kind of frustrating and

00:07:02.970 --> 00:07:05.150

resort<00:07:03.360> to<00:07:03.450> cheating<00:07:03.660> in<00:07:03.900> the<00:07:03.990> end

00:07:05.150 --> 00:07:05.160 
resort to cheating in the end

00:07:05.160 --> 00:07:07.850 
resort to cheating in the end
and<00:07:05.930> hopefully<00:07:06.930> I<00:07:07.230> won't<00:07:07.350> ever<00:07:07.500> have<00:07:07.650> to<00:07:07.710> do

00:07:07.850 --> 00:07:07.860 
and hopefully I won't ever have to do

00:07:07.860 --> 00:07:09.740 
and hopefully I won't ever have to do
that<00:07:07.980> again<00:07:08.250> this<00:07:08.480> it's<00:07:09.480> more<00:07:09.660> entertaining

00:07:09.740 --> 00:07:09.750 
that again this it's more entertaining

00:07:09.750 --> 00:07:12.020 
that again this it's more entertaining
to<00:07:10.200> watch<00:07:10.290> a<00:07:10.530> person<00:07:10.860> get<00:07:10.980> hurt<00:07:11.190> and<00:07:11.400> the<00:07:11.850> wash

00:07:12.020 --> 00:07:12.030 
to watch a person get hurt and the wash

00:07:12.030 --> 00:07:17.430 
to watch a person get hurt and the wash
them<00:07:12.240> succeed<00:07:12.740> that's<00:07:13.740> like

00:07:17.430 --> 00:07:17.440 

00:07:17.440 --> 00:07:21.270 

that's<00:07:18.440> like<00:07:18.620> the<00:07:18.770> britney<00:07:19.100> spears<00:07:19.490> effect

00:07:21.270 --> 00:07:21.280
