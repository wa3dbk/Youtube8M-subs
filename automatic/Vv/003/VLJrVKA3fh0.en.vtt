00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.210
 hello girls it's me sall I hope 

00:00:02.159 --> 00:00:06.180
 that everyone is fine 

00:00:03.210 --> 00:00:08.910
 so today we will make a mascara 

00:00:06.180 --> 00:00:13.080
 finally not bad because rather a care 

00:00:08.910 --> 00:00:14.880
 fortifying for damaged eyelashes even though 

00:00:13.080 --> 00:00:16.740
 you have the six wines that lacks 

00:00:14.880 --> 00:00:18.390
 volume that you put mascara all 

00:00:16.740 --> 00:00:20.910
 the days you lived your eyelashes 

00:00:18.390 --> 00:00:23.070
 become weaker if you put 

00:00:20.910 --> 00:00:24.090
 fossils regularly and that your eyelashes 

00:00:23.070 --> 00:00:26.160
 have been damaged 

00:00:24.090 --> 00:00:29.420
 well listen and we will try to fix 

00:00:26.160 --> 00:00:32.329
 all this so the main ingredients 

00:00:29.420 --> 00:00:35.480
 tomorrow night are going to be castor oil 

00:00:32.329 --> 00:00:37.829
 of which you take pure castor oil 

00:00:35.480 --> 00:00:38.280
 so why did I choose oil from 

00:00:37.829 --> 00:00:40.079
 castor 

00:00:38.280 --> 00:00:43.469
 I chose castor oil because 

00:00:40.079 --> 00:00:46.500
 that it has fortifying virtues and 

00:00:43.469 --> 00:00:49.140
 it promotes the growth of sites and 

00:00:46.500 --> 00:00:51.960
 the second main ingredient of my 

00:00:49.140 --> 00:00:53.940
 preparation it's going to be collagen 

00:00:51.960 --> 00:00:56.760
 plant that I bought on the site 

00:00:53.940 --> 00:00:58.829
 amazon so does the clown at 

00:00:56.760 --> 00:01:01.980
 collagen what are these proteins 

00:00:58.829 --> 00:01:05.369
 which microparticles of proteins 

00:01:01.980 --> 00:01:09.840
 will come to be attached to the keratin devos 

00:01:05.369 --> 00:01:12.000
 so it's actually okay it's going to be able 

00:01:09.840 --> 00:01:14.460
 give more volume to rossi him it's going 

00:01:12.000 --> 00:01:16.619
 have a sheathing and thickening effect 

00:01:14.460 --> 00:01:19.080
 so here I'm going to start with meter 

00:01:16.619 --> 00:01:23.130
 sixty milliliters of same in oil of 

00:01:19.080 --> 00:01:28.549
 castor and I'm going to use one leg 

00:01:23.130 --> 00:01:28.549
 of test pieces to calculate 

00:01:31.080 --> 00:01:36.700
 so that's what it says milliliters to 

00:01:33.610 --> 00:01:39.270
 pretty much and so we'll put him so 

00:01:36.700 --> 00:01:39.270
 six times 

00:02:03.350 --> 00:02:09.860
 I will put 30 milliliters or request 

00:02:05.740 --> 00:02:12.310
 collagen so that's the whole of 

00:02:09.860 --> 00:02:12.310
 product 

00:02:17.480 --> 00:02:28.109
 and I'm going to put 70 milliliters of water 

00:02:20.609 --> 00:02:32.719
 that I already regional is so there you 

00:02:28.109 --> 00:02:35.549
 can see that the oily phase 

00:02:32.719 --> 00:02:38.459
 therefore lille d'orissa is the aqueous phase 

00:02:35.549 --> 00:02:40.620
 of water and my driving she does not get 

00:02:38.459 --> 00:02:41.760
 do not mix so what I have for 4 get 

00:02:40.620 --> 00:02:44.069
 mix will use a 

00:02:41.760 --> 00:02:45.419
 emulsifying an emulsifier that 

00:02:44.069 --> 00:02:48.269
 allows you to mix oil and 

00:02:45.419 --> 00:02:51.629
 water and it gives texture 

00:02:48.269 --> 00:02:53.549
 of our care and so it will be multis 

00:02:51.629 --> 00:03:00.269
 trusting to the sweet books that I bought 

00:02:53.549 --> 00:03:02.129
 at harman's and I'm going to put a little 

00:03:00.269 --> 00:03:05.000
 close so 

00:03:02.129 --> 00:03:05.000
 that's it 

00:03:06.269 --> 00:03:11.620
 guys like that and of course it's not going 

00:03:09.760 --> 00:03:13.180
 to mix all by myself what I'm going 

00:03:11.620 --> 00:03:17.709
 to do is that I'm going to melt it all 

00:03:13.180 --> 00:03:20.019
 in the bain marie g melt everything at 

00:03:17.709 --> 00:03:22.200
 bain-marie which I put in my four 

00:03:20.019 --> 00:03:22.200
 women 

00:03:29.560 --> 00:03:32.310
 and I bring to a boil 

00:03:34.270 --> 00:03:40.120
 and in fact what I'm going to do is 

00:03:36.670 --> 00:03:43.570
 that I will wait for the sir they 

00:03:40.120 --> 00:03:46.680
 do completely in fact and I brought back 

00:03:43.570 --> 00:03:46.680
 as you go 

00:03:56.730 --> 00:04:02.030
 so here we can see that massira 

00:04:00.180 --> 00:04:05.040
 completely melted 

00:04:02.030 --> 00:04:06.330
 so there is no piece left and you 

00:04:05.040 --> 00:04:10.980
 have this milky texture 

00:04:06.330 --> 00:04:14.849
 so you have to mix well for the oil 

00:04:10.980 --> 00:04:18.380
 and the water is very homogeneous and we will 

00:04:14.849 --> 00:04:18.380
 remove from heat and let cool 

00:04:28.360 --> 00:04:34.479
 so now what am I going to do 

00:04:30.740 --> 00:04:37.370
 I'm going to add some code because 

00:04:34.479 --> 00:04:39.319
 the coach has crossed a conservative 

00:04:37.370 --> 00:04:41.659
 it will prevent the bacteria from 

00:04:39.319 --> 00:04:43.940
 develop in your product and that its 

00:04:41.659 --> 00:04:46.190
 presence is there then as I when 

00:04:43.940 --> 00:04:49.370
 even a lot of preparation I'm going 

00:04:46.190 --> 00:04:55.569
 put two milliliters of this suit 

00:04:49.370 --> 00:04:55.569
 which equals 66 tastes so 

00:06:10.990 --> 00:06:15.169
 so here what I'm going to do is for 

00:06:13.639 --> 00:06:18.529
 to be cold, it's like that 

00:06:15.169 --> 00:06:23.029
 thicken I'll put that in the fridge and 

00:06:18.529 --> 00:06:25.240
 I'll show you the result so here we go 

00:06:23.029 --> 00:06:29.539
 the final text 

00:06:25.240 --> 00:06:34.490
 so that's enough was still 

00:06:29.539 --> 00:06:36.860
 So here I would like it in cure three 

00:06:34.490 --> 00:06:42.399
 once a week or from time to time in 

00:06:36.860 --> 00:06:42.399
 below the below the masa
