00:00:11.190 --> 00:00:15.360
 hello I am delighted to find you 

00:00:13.500 --> 00:00:18.029
 today to present you a 

00:00:15.360 --> 00:00:20.160
 new hooks lesson she's going 

00:00:18.029 --> 00:00:23.099
 concern the realization of the 

00:00:20.160 --> 00:00:25.439
 horizontal buttonhole so you go 

00:00:23.099 --> 00:00:27.930
 see it's very simple so I realized 

00:00:25.439 --> 00:00:29.070
 here a first rank in flange friends you 

00:00:27.930 --> 00:00:29.869
 could have done it in a completely different 

00:00:29.070 --> 00:00:32.009
 point 

00:00:29.869 --> 00:00:35.399
 so I'm doing three mesh in the air for 

00:00:32.009 --> 00:00:39.469
 turn one two three I tend my 

00:00:35.399 --> 00:00:42.210
 work and I continue in flange 

00:00:39.469 --> 00:00:45.780
 I continue to bridle until 

00:00:42.210 --> 00:00:46.739
 I arrive at the beginning of my buttonhole so 

00:00:45.780 --> 00:00:48.600
 Up to you 

00:00:46.739 --> 00:00:52.010
 the locations provided in your 

00:00:48.600 --> 00:00:54.300
 book for placebo boutonniere so 

00:00:52.010 --> 00:00:56.879
 I will decide that I close 

00:00:54.300 --> 00:00:58.859
 buttonhole in three miles so I 

00:00:56.879 --> 00:01:03.149
 still carries 3 flange and this will be the 

00:00:58.859 --> 00:01:09.470
 beginning of my buttonhole a year first 

00:01:03.149 --> 00:01:09.470
 second breen 

00:01:09.750 --> 00:01:12.890
 and third 

00:01:14.040 --> 00:01:18.840
 so here I decide what is it 

00:01:16.290 --> 00:01:22.940
 so the beginning of my buttonhole that goes 

00:01:18.840 --> 00:01:26.250
 make space so 3 mayans look 

00:01:22.940 --> 00:01:28.740
 obviously it's up to you to look at the 

00:01:26.250 --> 00:01:30.120
 width of your button to evaluate the 

00:01:28.740 --> 00:01:33.210
 number of males in rut manner that 

00:01:30.120 --> 00:01:35.820
 match the buttonhole that you 

00:01:33.210 --> 00:01:38.640
 will therefore fit exactly to the width 

00:01:35.820 --> 00:01:42.420
 of your button so I'm based on 

00:01:38.640 --> 00:01:46.830
 the width of 3 mesh and I'm going 

00:01:42.420 --> 00:01:48.450
 reproduce the three my above which 

00:01:46.830 --> 00:01:50.550
 correspond to the width of the 

00:01:48.450 --> 00:01:58.590
 buttonhole so I'm doing three stitches in 

00:01:50.550 --> 00:02:01.470
 the air 2 3 this is how I realized my three 

00:01:58.590 --> 00:02:04.530
 mesh and now I'm going to make a 

00:02:01.470 --> 00:02:08.459
 flange to close the buttonhole and I 

00:02:04.530 --> 00:02:10.709
 will place it on the 4th badly since 

00:02:08.459 --> 00:02:11.840
 three my in front correspond to the 

00:02:10.709 --> 00:02:17.880
 buttonhole 

00:02:11.840 --> 00:02:19.350
 so I'm doing madrid and here I have 

00:02:17.880 --> 00:02:23.989
 made my buttonhole 

00:02:19.350 --> 00:02:23.989
 so I continue my rank all ambrine 

00:02:25.160 --> 00:02:32.840
 and I will show you how 

00:02:29.220 --> 00:02:32.840
 do to make it after 

00:02:35.350 --> 00:02:42.070
 alain so I finished in good rank you 

00:02:39.730 --> 00:02:44.830
 see the buttonhole appears clearly 

00:02:42.070 --> 00:02:50.050
 people of a 3 mesh in the air for 

00:02:44.830 --> 00:02:55.180
 turn I turn and I continue in 

00:02:50.050 --> 00:03:03.430
 brilliant until I get to 

00:02:55.180 --> 00:03:07.120
 beginning of my buttonhole here I come 

00:03:03.430 --> 00:03:10.300
 so at the beginning of my buttonhole and I 

00:03:07.120 --> 00:03:12.130
 will reproduce in flange so three 

00:03:10.300 --> 00:03:15.070
 mesh in the air three breeze I'm going 

00:03:12.130 --> 00:03:16.420
 make 3 bridle to restore a rank 

00:03:15.070 --> 00:03:18.810
 while bridle above the 

00:03:16.420 --> 00:03:18.810
 buttonhole 

00:03:20.130 --> 00:03:29.860
 I stitch first brick I transplant into 

00:03:27.940 --> 00:03:34.660
 the mesh to second side 

00:03:29.860 --> 00:03:36.819
 brennan and I re ping in third 

00:03:34.660 --> 00:03:38.340
 handle 

00:03:36.819 --> 00:03:42.939
 so the third eye in the air 

00:03:38.340 --> 00:03:47.099
 third city so here I have 

00:03:42.939 --> 00:03:49.629
 reproduced on the rank of the top flange 3 

00:03:47.099 --> 00:03:51.430
 on the three knits in the air that have 

00:03:49.629 --> 00:03:54.700
 so allowed the opening of the 

00:03:51.430 --> 00:04:00.040
 buttonhole and I continue all the time 

00:03:54.700 --> 00:04:03.180
 real until the end of my rank 

00:04:00.040 --> 00:04:03.180
 so I'm almost done 

00:04:07.780 --> 00:04:10.560
 another ruin 

00:04:13.030 --> 00:04:20.079
 so that's how you can 

00:04:14.440 --> 00:04:22.180
 find the buttonhole and realized so 

00:04:20.079 --> 00:04:23.650
 always the principle you start 

00:04:22.180 --> 00:04:26.590
 your first rank in the point that 

00:04:23.650 --> 00:04:29.650
 you chose you start want to 

00:04:26.590 --> 00:04:31.570
 the second row or decide where 

00:04:29.650 --> 00:04:36.190
 where we are going to find a buttonhole 

00:04:31.570 --> 00:04:40.210
 you decide how wide mike he is going 

00:04:36.190 --> 00:04:43.060
 we must leave the number of mesh 

00:04:40.210 --> 00:04:45.610
 in the air to reproduce that is equal to the 

00:04:43.060 --> 00:04:48.130
 width of the buttonhole and then 

00:04:45.610 --> 00:04:51.490
 you continue according to the point you 

00:04:48.130 --> 00:04:55.390
 have chosen is the third rank you 

00:04:51.490 --> 00:04:57.340
 reproduce the total number of mesh 

00:04:55.390 --> 00:05:00.280
 that you had at the forefront is the 

00:04:57.340 --> 00:05:01.720
 your boutonniere efforts but here I 

00:05:00.280 --> 00:05:04.030
 Thank you for your attention for 

00:05:01.720 --> 00:05:05.350
 this lesson so see you soon for a 

00:05:04.030 --> 00:05:07.680
 new hooks lesson together 

00:05:05.350 --> 00:05:07.680
