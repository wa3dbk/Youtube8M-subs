00:00:00.410 --> 00:00:06.439
 two kids how are you there are you 

00:00:03.350 --> 00:00:09.549
 I will explain how to tie a plant 

00:00:06.439 --> 00:00:14.179
 properly and what stones to use 

00:00:09.549 --> 00:00:16.519
 in your aquarium as you see here below it 

00:00:14.179 --> 00:00:19.620
 You can see how the template is 

00:00:16.519 --> 00:00:23.270
 practically loose 

00:00:19.620 --> 00:00:23.270
 we have to say it's a girlfriend 

00:00:23.590 --> 00:00:28.230
 and what we 're going to do is take it out 

00:00:25.930 --> 00:00:32.130
 Y 

00:00:28.230 --> 00:00:34.100
 and cut a little bit what are their roots and 

00:00:32.130 --> 00:00:38.379
 tie it with 

00:00:34.100 --> 00:00:38.379
 with fishing line to a stone 

00:00:38.510 --> 00:00:47.180
 we will need a stone like this 

00:00:43.370 --> 00:00:49.280
 or the one that you can have that mine is of 

00:00:47.180 --> 00:00:51.379
 volcanic origin if you do not know if the 

00:00:49.280 --> 00:00:53.210
 you can put in the aquarium what 

00:00:51.379 --> 00:00:54.540
 that the only thing you have to do is a 

00:00:53.210 --> 00:00:59.420
 test 

00:00:54.540 --> 00:01:03.000
 to choose said view and if you have 

00:00:59.420 --> 00:01:05.010
 Strong water, bitches in your house 

00:01:03.000 --> 00:01:06.830
 throw him over like a churro 

00:01:05.010 --> 00:01:11.240
 simple 

00:01:06.830 --> 00:01:14.720
 very small and if bubbles come out 

00:01:11.240 --> 00:01:17.090
 means that it is a kalina stone and for 

00:01:14.720 --> 00:01:18.720
 so it can not go inside your 

00:01:17.090 --> 00:01:22.170
 Aquarius 

00:01:18.720 --> 00:01:24.280
 because it is very bad for the fish and not 

00:01:22.170 --> 00:01:26.110
 can have it inside 

00:01:24.280 --> 00:01:27.430
 if you look at the origin 

00:01:26.110 --> 00:01:30.340
 volcanic are the best and the most 

00:01:27.430 --> 00:01:33.070
 recommended for example to see 

00:01:30.340 --> 00:01:35.409
 the agreement, you see, I have some 

00:01:33.070 --> 00:01:38.670
 how many with beans that have been 

00:01:35.409 --> 00:01:38.670
 perfectly adapted as 

00:01:39.550 --> 00:01:44.350
 they are stones 

00:01:41.710 --> 00:01:48.479
 very porous 

00:01:44.350 --> 00:01:53.250
 where the root can be inserted etc 

00:01:48.479 --> 00:01:56.300
 good and now we proceed to what is 

00:01:53.250 --> 00:02:00.160
 the removed from the plant 

00:01:56.300 --> 00:02:00.160
 and we will get to it 

00:02:00.360 --> 00:02:05.770
 ok now we will do it very carefully 

00:02:02.790 --> 00:02:10.619
 we lift the lid 

00:02:05.770 --> 00:02:10.619
 and we lift it very carefully 

00:02:17.069 --> 00:02:22.080
 then you do not read 

00:02:19.230 --> 00:02:23.730
 well here you have it out let's go to 

00:02:22.080 --> 00:02:30.260
 pass it 

00:02:23.730 --> 00:02:30.260
 to this 12 and the three 

00:02:37.990 --> 00:02:43.600
 well here we have the stone and what 

00:02:41.620 --> 00:02:46.020
 we will cut the leaves a little 

00:02:43.600 --> 00:02:46.020
 that are 

00:02:46.360 --> 00:02:52.070
 a little bit uglier 

00:02:49.850 --> 00:02:55.620
 to see you go looking around for 

00:02:52.070 --> 00:02:58.200
 silvio remove part d 

00:02:55.620 --> 00:03:00.920
 the leftover is always coming 

00:02:58.200 --> 00:03:00.920
 the plants 

00:03:04.960 --> 00:03:09.880
 as you can see here they have 

00:03:07.610 --> 00:03:13.240
 that we also remove this 

00:03:09.880 --> 00:03:16.630
 it has a lot of roots and we will have 

00:03:13.240 --> 00:03:19.210
 that adjust them to the size of the plant 

00:03:16.630 --> 00:03:21.400
 which as you can see is quite big too 

00:03:19.210 --> 00:03:24.569
 we'll cut through here 

00:03:21.400 --> 00:03:24.569
 a little bit this 

00:03:25.930 --> 00:03:31.260
 I do not know if to remove you were a little bit 

00:03:28.359 --> 00:03:31.260
 faith so 

00:03:39.319 --> 00:03:42.999
 look how the back is
