 people who have balances on their accounts 

00:01:11.460 --> 00:01:12.990
 hunting more than a thousand rubles 

00:01:12.990 --> 00:01:14.350
 of these thirty five thousand people 

00:01:14.350 --> 00:01:17.820
 quite a large number of citizens 

00:01:17.820 --> 00:01:19.480
 Russian Federation have 

00:01:19.480 --> 00:01:22.660

00:01:24.320 --> 00:01:26.890
 6 thousand 800 thousand 6 

00:01:26.890 --> 00:01:29.140
 that's about 19 percent 

00:01:29.140 --> 00:01:30.850
 currently the central bank 

00:01:30.850 --> 00:01:33.370
 filed a petition with the arbitration court 

00:01:33.370 --> 00:01:35.040
 river bank shares 

00:01:35.040 --> 00:01:38.180
 he but most likely the background will follow 

00:01:38.180 --> 00:01:40.440
 according to a bankruptcy statement 

00:01:40.440 --> 00:01:42.980
 from point of view 

00:01:42.980 --> 00:01:45.180
 protecting the interests of creditors and procedures 

00:01:45.180 --> 00:01:46.500
 which you come across 

00:01:46.500 --> 00:01:48.520
 to a large extent but it has no 

00:01:48.520 --> 00:01:49.800
 forced values 

00:01:49.800 --> 00:01:52.400
 liquidation or bankruptcy now we 

00:01:52.400 --> 00:01:53.960
 generation we were initially seen 

00:01:53.960 --> 00:01:55.270
 that on all creditors not on 

00:01:55.270 --> 00:01:56.580
 first and second 

00:01:56.580 --> 00:01:58.860
 well, the third turn in aggregate money is not 

00:01:58.860 --> 00:01:59.370
 enough 

00:01:59.370 --> 00:02:00.920
 inspector question where will be held 

00:02:00.920 --> 00:02:03.950
 chyrin price move what he is dedicated will do 

00:02:03.950 --> 00:02:05.710
 expectations vector 

00:02:05.710 --> 00:02:08.229
 he is a goa 

00:02:08.229 --> 00:02:09.739
 in what currency 

00:02:09.739 --> 00:02:11.209
 pessimistic case is not complete 

00:02:11.209 --> 00:02:12.770
 redemption first turn 

00:02:12.770 --> 00:02:14.680
 but it can be close enough to 

00:02:14.680 --> 00:02:15.739
 one hundred percent 

00:02:15.739 --> 00:02:17.260
 he is optimistic 

00:02:17.260 --> 00:02:19.950
 option this is honor repayments of creditors 

00:02:19.950 --> 00:02:21.389
 third turn and full closure 

00:02:21.389 --> 00:02:22.859
 first night lenders 

00:02:22.859 --> 00:02:25.569
 what to do with it for those who have more leftovers 

00:02:25.569 --> 00:02:26.319
 700 thousand 

00:02:26.319 --> 00:02:28.030

00:02:29.599 --> 00:02:30.999
 to the lender 

00:02:30.999 --> 00:02:32.449
 percentage in more detail my will 

00:02:32.449 --> 00:02:33.949
 you need to say something basically 

00:02:33.949 --> 00:02:36.109
 information but we have samples on our site 

00:02:36.109 --> 00:02:37.789

00:02:37.789 --> 00:02:39.220
 for that now 

00:02:39.220 --> 00:02:42.220
 important as soon as possible tied 3 

00:02:42.769 --> 00:02:45.019
 because recognition requirements in 

00:02:45.019 --> 00:02:47.179

00:03:19.319 --> 00:03:22.319
 as for a historians estimated 

00:03:22.319 --> 00:03:23.389
 here you can 

00:03:23.389 --> 00:03:25.879
 Here I can say the statistics 

00:03:25.879 --> 00:03:28.619
 within the bankruptcy proceedings 

00:03:28.619 --> 00:03:30.089
 federal cost 

00:03:30.089 --> 00:03:33.559
 the property we form at 

00:03:33.559 --> 00:03:35.949
 selling out and figuring out what 

00:03:35.949 --> 00:03:37.579
 loans are technical and all 

00:03:37.579 --> 00:03:38.149
 rest 

00:03:38.149 --> 00:03:41.049
 and on the street 200 percent 

00:03:41.049 --> 00:03:43.040
 otto bokku that shown honor 

00:03:43.040 --> 00:03:43.799
 Citibank 

00:03:43.799 --> 00:03:46.079
 it's a disgrace but it is so 

00:03:46.079 --> 00:03:47.769
 since we touched the procedure 

00:03:47.769 --> 00:03:49.459
 filing requirements is quite important 

00:03:49.459 --> 00:03:51.559
 procedure that each of the weddings 

00:03:51.559 --> 00:03:53.180
 present not only fulfilled 

00:03:53.180 --> 00:03:54.309
 properly 

00:03:54.309 --> 00:03:56.269
 let's here be done some 

00:03:56.269 --> 00:03:58.239
 another emphasis on this procedure so all 

00:03:58.239 --> 00:03:59.639
 starts with filing requirements 

00:03:59.639 --> 00:04:01.069
 creditors 

00:04:01.069 --> 00:04:03.789
 on the podium three rounds it is important to file in time 

00:04:03.789 --> 00:04:06.179
 no later than the registry closes 

00:04:06.179 --> 00:04:08.679
 candidate interests lenders who 

00:04:08.679 --> 00:04:10.459
 want to be close in the registry 

00:04:10.459 --> 00:04:12.059
 not beyond 

00:04:12.059 --> 00:04:14.219
 as far as I know to the podium 

00:04:14.219 --> 00:04:16.319
 lenders need to attach 

00:04:16.319 --> 00:04:17.789
 to the regional documents which 

00:04:17.789 --> 00:04:18.829
 confirm 

00:04:18.829 --> 00:04:19.680
 decisive 

00:04:19.680 --> 00:04:21.059
 fully completed 

00:04:21.059 --> 00:04:22.869
 like what it means properly 

00:04:22.869 --> 00:04:24.869
 certified copies if you don't want 

00:04:24.869 --> 00:04:27.529

 cause of the crash 

00:04:37.289 --> 00:04:38.289
 sports 

00:04:38.289 --> 00:04:40.740

00:04:40.740 --> 00:04:42.630
 unknown 

00:04:42.630 --> 00:04:45.300
 in light of this, the fact itself is recorded
