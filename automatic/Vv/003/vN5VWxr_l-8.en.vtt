00:00:27.140 --> 00:00:28.390
 five continents 

00:00:28.390 --> 00:00:32.079
 suspended for the fingertips more than 1000 meters from the ground he learns 

00:00:32.079 --> 00:00:36.670
 the abstraction of emptiness the costs of fear and the importance of the gesture on his 

00:00:36.670 --> 00:00:40.350
 hands every millimeter of polluting is essential to stay gripped at the

00:00:44.510 --> 00:00:46.090
 favorite of joannie 

00:00:46.090 --> 00:00:49.090
 vertically it is possible

 the world of online games arjel 

00:01:23.550 --> 00:01:25.760
 I bet the feeling of dizziness 

00:01:25.760 --> 00:01:30.440
 only reserve it is a sensation really to admamÃ© 

00:01:31.290 --> 00:01:34.290
 remains that the vertigo of love 

00:01:34.970 --> 00:01:37.970
 somewhere in Switzerland at 2500 meters altitude 

00:01:40.790 --> 00:01:44.920
 I want a policy that launches an impossible challenge presented this bar for 

00:01:44.920 --> 00:01:47.810
 he alone has 2,700 meters 

00:01:47.810 --> 00:01:48.900
 nobody 

00:01:48.900 --> 00:01:51.900
 the successful such a feat 

00:01:52.760 --> 00:01:55.700
 icon 

00:01:55.700 --> 00:01:58.860
 outside 

00:01:58.860 --> 00:02:03.000
 exhilarating on the scene the world to open the most dizzying lanes 

00:02:03.570 --> 00:02:05.530
 in Pakistan 

00:02:05.530 --> 00:02:06.720
 big united states 

00:02:06.720 --> 00:02:08.409
 in mali or madagascar 

00:02:08.409 --> 00:02:10.489
 he explored a menu the Toulouse 

00:02:10.489 --> 00:02:13.489
 but from the planet 

00:02:14.539 --> 00:02:19.439
 why single god and become an actor of great parish direction 

00:02:19.439 --> 00:02:21.549
 congratulate pierre boulle de geneva 

00:02:21.549 --> 00:02:25.720
 the cradle of the rock climbing god bless that's the same salary 

00:02:26.220 --> 00:02:29.220
 it is precisely this experience 

00:02:38.349 --> 00:02:39.839
 it was very nice 

00:02:39.839 --> 00:02:41.939
 okay know 

00:02:41.939 --> 00:02:44.939
 understand 

00:02:50.459 --> 00:02:53.069
 we know who is the hamas who kept her 

00:02:53.069 --> 00:02:54.939
 it's the gesture 

00:02:54.939 --> 00:02:57.519
 his corsair gestures 

00:02:57.519 --> 00:02:59.419
 these agreements that come 

00:02:59.419 --> 00:03:01.739
 who fits 

00:03:01.739 --> 00:03:05.089
 finally you go in one direction with the whole body 

00:03:05.089 --> 00:03:09.179
 so can not resist the global monster hunt in the end at this 

00:03:09.179 --> 00:03:11.859
 movement 

00:03:11.859 --> 00:03:14.859
 he had been asked for more 

00:03:15.779 --> 00:03:18.689
 for 2011 a lot of ease 

00:03:18.689 --> 00:03:21.349
 maybe we could have less training 

00:03:21.349 --> 00:03:23.539
 the average 

00:03:23.539 --> 00:03:26.539
 a lot of training for chili 

00:03:29.249 --> 00:03:32.709
 how am I going to tell myself that he had rolled up possible 

00:03:32.709 --> 00:03:35.709
 everything starts with a love at first sight between him and the rock 

00:03:37.499 --> 00:03:38.540
 he woos 

00:03:38.540 --> 00:03:41.540
 a bit like taming each other 

00:03:42.109 --> 00:03:45.899
 often seen by some time and this is the first time we are 

00:03:45.899 --> 00:03:47.309
 touched and it seems 

00:03:47.309 --> 00:03:50.510
 try to imagine a dunk admits to be returning month after 

00:03:51.059 --> 00:03:54.059
 and something happened and it looks just as high 

00:03:54.709 --> 00:03:57.709
 it's a perfect explanation 

00:03:59.259 --> 00:04:02.549
 progressed on a manu wall requires extreme concentration 

00:04:03.179 --> 00:04:06.149
 a total mobilization of the muscles of the body 

00:04:06.149 --> 00:04:09.149
 of all his joints 

00:04:11.369 --> 00:04:13.229
 very very extreme movements 

00:04:13.229 --> 00:04:16.430
 we are in a year of apnea 

00:04:16.430 --> 00:04:19.590
 that's very important to know how to handle these moments of apnea 

00:04:20.150 --> 00:04:23.919
 and m after return anytime for the body needs oxygen for 

00:04:23.919 --> 00:04:25.449
 can recover power 

00:04:25.449 --> 00:04:28.650
 continue to progress 

00:04:28.650 --> 00:04:31.080
 climbing is an extreme sport 

00:04:31.080 --> 00:04:34.080
 which requires precision at all times 

00:04:43.779 --> 00:04:46.779
 my career 

00:04:48.930 --> 00:04:52.180
 the station especially the strength of scala equipment 

00:04:52.180 --> 00:04:55.729
 near grenoble we are at the world leader in design with 

00:04:55.729 --> 00:04:58.120
 mathieu mechanical engineer 

00:04:58.120 --> 00:05:00.719
 we're going to go to lady at the series tower 

00:05:00.719 --> 00:05:03.479
 more commonly known as torture room 

00:05:03.479 --> 00:05:07.160
 to accompany the climbers in their progression and to prevent them from falling here 

00:05:07.159 --> 00:05:10.159
 everything was quoted and in the worst possible conditions 

00:05:11.620 --> 00:05:15.470
 the psr and 4% to 6% and his eyes for 24 hours 

00:05:17.439 --> 00:05:19.699
 in a freezer 

00:05:19.699 --> 00:05:21.620
 24 years in a freezer 

00:05:21.620 --> 00:05:24.620
 to reproduce the sometimes extreme cold of the mountain 

00:05:25.860 --> 00:05:29.139
 so the synthesis of beresford to sion with a mass 

00:05:29.139 --> 00:05:30.650
 three pounds 

00:05:30.650 --> 00:05:33.650
 that tend to put 

00:05:38.740 --> 00:05:41.159
 verdict 

00:05:41.159 --> 00:05:45.200
 the mass did not go through the casting who had no contact 

00:05:45.200 --> 00:05:47.430
 between the mass and the prostate 

00:05:47.430 --> 00:05:50.430
 so the helmet and that form 

00:05:50.949 --> 00:05:53.949
 all the staff pushed to breaking 

00:05:53.949 --> 00:05:57.160
 as we wish there was a pulling force of two commas 3 

00:05:57.159 --> 00:06:00.159
 tons double what can stand a human body 

00:06:04.770 --> 00:06:07.129
 visibly always more innovative 

00:06:07.129 --> 00:06:10.479
 we will never guarantee life to 100% of the great themes of the extreme 

00:06:12.509 --> 00:06:13.409
 why put 

00:06:13.409 --> 00:06:14.939
 very rational 

00:06:14.939 --> 00:06:16.900
 very reasonable 

00:06:16.900 --> 00:06:18.339
 picture to 

00:06:18.339 --> 00:06:20.300
 they always have us 

00:06:20.300 --> 00:06:23.300
 get carried away by the emotions to the investigators 

00:06:24.490 --> 00:06:28.060
 fourteen employees also understand engaged in me it's a joke 

00:06:28.839 --> 00:06:31.569
 the dry weather the fifa played yesterday 

00:06:31.569 --> 00:06:34.869
 paris was mainly the future 

00:06:34.869 --> 00:06:37.889
 it's the secret of the gods but a little girl who shows us that 

00:06:37.889 --> 00:06:39.190
 man and nature 

00:06:39.190 --> 00:06:40.150
 yet how to live together
