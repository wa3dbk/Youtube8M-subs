 notepad read me everything is written here 

00:00:41.370 --> 00:00:47.700
 detail but extra thought will be 

00:00:44.430 --> 00:00:49.800

00:00:49.800 --> 00:00:55.820

00:00:58.620 --> 00:01:05.850

00:01:05.850 --> 00:01:12.360
 need this all our objects all textures 

00:01:08.100 --> 00:01:14.150

00:01:35.970 --> 00:01:42.200
 saying a copy of the case if you want later 

00:01:38.750 --> 00:01:46.289
 return previous texture objects 

00:01:42.200 --> 00:01:48.869
