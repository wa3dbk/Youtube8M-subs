heat and we're going to give it a second
or<00:01:15.860> two<00:01:15.890> to<00:01:16.340> adjust<00:01:17.270> but<00:01:17.510> you'll<00:01:17.690> see<00:01:18.050> the<00:01:18.500> heat

00:01:18.790 --> 00:01:18.800 
or two to adjust but you'll see the heat

00:01:18.800 --> 00:01:23.860 
or two to adjust but you'll see the heat
start<00:01:19.190> to<00:01:19.460> decline<00:01:20.110> now<00:01:21.159> if<00:01:22.159> you<00:01:22.490> had<00:01:22.870> your

00:01:23.860 --> 00:01:23.870 
start to decline now if you had your

00:01:23.870 --> 00:01:26.410 
start to decline now if you had your
foot<00:01:24.170> in<00:01:24.320> there<00:01:24.500> it<00:01:25.130> would<00:01:25.550> obviously<00:01:25.730> keep

00:01:26.410 --> 00:01:26.420 
foot in there it would obviously keep

00:01:26.420 --> 00:01:27.610 
foot in there it would obviously keep
the<00:01:26.570> heat<00:01:26.780> in<00:01:26.930> that<00:01:26.960> it's<00:01:27.260> kind<00:01:27.380> of<00:01:27.470> like

opening a room put the window open and
heat<00:01:30.740> dissipates<00:01:31.330> one<00:01:32.330> other<00:01:32.480> thing<00:01:32.630> I'll

00:01:32.920 --> 00:01:32.930 
heat dissipates one other thing I'll

00:01:32.930 --> 00:01:34.630 
heat dissipates one other thing I'll
show<00:01:33.140> you<00:01:33.200> is<00:01:33.440> kind<00:01:33.590> of<00:01:33.740> how<00:01:33.860> it<00:01:34.010> works<00:01:34.250> so<00:01:34.490> when
