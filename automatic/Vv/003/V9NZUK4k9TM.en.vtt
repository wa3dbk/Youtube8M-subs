just<00:00:26.730> Jerry<00:00:27.090> showing<00:00:27.449> today<00:00:27.570> we're<00:00:27.840> gonna

00:00:27.920 --> 00:00:27.930 
just Jerry showing today we're gonna

00:00:27.930 --> 00:00:31.820 
just Jerry showing today we're gonna
look<00:00:28.109> at<00:00:28.230> the<00:00:28.380> Cloris<00:00:28.980> XT<00:00:29.820> 15<00:00:30.599> if<00:00:31.320> you<00:00:31.500> remember

00:00:31.820 --> 00:00:31.830 
look at the Cloris XT 15 if you remember

00:00:31.830 --> 00:00:34.310 
look at the Cloris XT 15 if you remember
a<00:00:31.859> few<00:00:31.920> months<00:00:32.099> back<00:00:32.550> I<00:00:32.790> reviewed<00:00:33.390> the<00:00:33.719> Cloris

00:00:34.310 --> 00:00:34.320 
a few months back I reviewed the Cloris

00:00:34.320 --> 00:00:37.430 
a few months back I reviewed the Cloris
XT<00:00:35.130> 12<00:00:35.610> so<00:00:36.420> I<00:00:36.450> guess<00:00:36.690> you<00:00:36.809> could<00:00:36.930> say<00:00:37.170> that<00:00:37.350> the

00:00:37.430 --> 00:00:37.440 
XT 12 so I guess you could say that the

00:00:37.440 --> 00:00:39.709 
XT 12 so I guess you could say that the
XT<00:00:37.860> 15<00:00:38.340> is<00:00:38.489> maybe<00:00:38.700> like<00:00:38.910> the<00:00:39.090> bigger<00:00:39.360> brother

00:00:39.709 --> 00:00:39.719 
XT 15 is maybe like the bigger brother

00:00:39.719 --> 00:00:42.680 
XT 15 is maybe like the bigger brother
or<00:00:40.140> the<00:00:40.379> XT<00:00:40.680> 12<00:00:40.980> is<00:00:41.190> like<00:00:41.399> the<00:00:41.640> little<00:00:42.450> brother

00:00:42.680 --> 00:00:42.690 
or the XT 12 is like the little brother

00:00:42.690 --> 00:00:45.380 
or the XT 12 is like the little brother
but<00:00:43.170> if<00:00:43.290> you're<00:00:43.440> familiar<00:00:43.620> with<00:00:44.550> the<00:00:44.700> xt<00:00:45.059> 12

00:00:45.380 --> 00:00:45.390 
but if you're familiar with the xt 12

00:00:45.390 --> 00:00:49.729 
but if you're familiar with the xt 12
the<00:00:45.930> xt<00:00:46.260> 15<00:00:46.739> has<00:00:47.160> a<00:00:47.190> lot<00:00:47.760> of<00:00:48.079> similarities<00:00:49.079> but

00:00:49.729 --> 00:00:49.739 
the xt 15 has a lot of similarities but

00:00:49.739 --> 00:00:52.700 
the xt 15 has a lot of similarities but
there<00:00:49.890> are<00:00:50.070> a<00:00:50.100> few<00:00:50.399> differences<00:00:50.820> so<00:00:51.690> they<00:00:52.379> both

00:00:52.700 --> 00:00:52.710 
there are a few differences so they both

00:00:52.710 --> 00:00:56.479 
there are a few differences so they both
have<00:00:53.010> the<00:00:53.219> dual<00:00:53.719> tail<00:00:54.719> switch<00:00:55.110> one<00:00:55.920> is<00:00:56.160> a

00:00:56.479 --> 00:00:56.489 
have the dual tail switch one is a

00:00:56.489 --> 00:01:00.400 
have the dual tail switch one is a
momentary<00:00:57.180> and<00:00:57.510> the<00:00:57.960> other<00:00:58.109> is<00:00:58.379> a<00:00:58.559> strobe<00:00:59.010> and

00:01:00.400 --> 00:01:00.410 
momentary and the other is a strobe and

00:01:00.410 --> 00:01:04.219 
momentary and the other is a strobe and
the<00:01:01.410> xt<00:01:02.010> 15<00:01:02.460> has<00:01:02.699> the<00:01:02.910> same<00:01:03.180> exact<00:01:03.629> set<00:01:03.899> up<00:01:04.049> to

00:01:04.219 --> 00:01:04.229 
the xt 15 has the same exact set up to

00:01:04.229 --> 00:01:06.830 
the xt 15 has the same exact set up to
where<00:01:04.409> it's<00:01:04.739> you<00:01:04.949> can<00:01:05.070> go<00:01:05.189> momentary<00:01:05.909> full

00:01:06.830 --> 00:01:06.840 
where it's you can go momentary full

00:01:06.840 --> 00:01:12.020 
where it's you can go momentary full
click<00:01:07.200> or<00:01:07.549> you<00:01:08.549> can<00:01:08.580> do<00:01:08.850> strobe<00:01:09.500> and<00:01:10.729> they<00:01:11.729> both

00:01:12.020 --> 00:01:12.030 
click or you can do strobe and they both

00:01:12.030 --> 00:01:14.899 
click or you can do strobe and they both
work<00:01:12.630> with<00:01:13.020> the<00:01:13.080> fast<00:01:13.710> magnetic<00:01:14.430> charging

00:01:14.899 --> 00:01:14.909 
work with the fast magnetic charging

00:01:14.909 --> 00:01:18.020 
work with the fast magnetic charging
these<00:01:15.090> have<00:01:15.830> rechargeable<00:01:16.830> batteries<00:01:17.460> you

00:01:18.020 --> 00:01:18.030 
these have rechargeable batteries you

00:01:18.030 --> 00:01:19.249 
these have rechargeable batteries you
don't<00:01:18.210> have<00:01:18.299> to<00:01:18.390> take<00:01:18.540> them<00:01:18.720> out<00:01:18.869> to<00:01:19.020> charge

00:01:19.249 --> 00:01:19.259 
don't have to take them out to charge

00:01:19.259 --> 00:01:22.580 
don't have to take them out to charge
you<00:01:19.530> literally<00:01:19.860> just<00:01:20.310> boom<00:01:21.119> like<00:01:21.479> that<00:01:21.659> and<00:01:22.170> it

00:01:22.580 --> 00:01:22.590 
you literally just boom like that and it

00:01:22.590 --> 00:01:25.910 
you literally just boom like that and it
begins<00:01:22.950> to<00:01:23.189> charge<00:01:23.430> and<00:01:23.790> the<00:01:24.509> xt<00:01:24.990> 12<00:01:25.350> charger

00:01:25.910 --> 00:01:25.920 
begins to charge and the xt 12 charger

00:01:25.920 --> 00:01:29.240 
begins to charge and the xt 12 charger
will<00:01:26.250> work<00:01:26.460> for<00:01:26.820> the<00:01:26.970> xt<00:01:27.479> 15<00:01:27.990> and<00:01:28.290> by

00:01:29.240 --> 00:01:29.250 
will work for the xt 15 and by

00:01:29.250 --> 00:01:31.039 
will work for the xt 15 and by
subversive<00:01:29.939> so<00:01:30.030> that's<00:01:30.180> really<00:01:30.420> nice<00:01:30.689> that

00:03:16.920 --> 00:03:18.770 

I'm<00:03:17.790> not<00:03:17.970> sure<00:03:18.120> if<00:03:18.210> you<00:03:18.270> can<00:03:18.360> tell<00:03:18.420> on<00:03:18.660> the

00:03:18.770 --> 00:03:18.780 
I'm not sure if you can tell on the

00:03:18.780 --> 00:03:20.570 
I'm not sure if you can tell on the
camera<00:03:18.810> but<00:03:19.230> you<00:03:19.260> can<00:03:19.320> tell<00:03:19.620> the<00:03:19.800> XT<00:03:20.130> 15

00:03:20.570 --> 00:03:20.580 
camera but you can tell the XT 15

00:03:20.580 --> 00:03:22.880 
camera but you can tell the XT 15
definitely<00:03:21.120> has<00:03:21.270> a<00:03:21.540> bigger<00:03:21.810> hotspot<00:03:22.560> there<00:03:22.800> in

00:03:22.880 --> 00:03:22.890 
definitely has a bigger hotspot there in

00:03:22.890 --> 00:03:25.430 
definitely has a bigger hotspot there in
the<00:03:22.980> middle<00:03:23.340> more<00:03:24.150> defined<00:03:24.630> and<00:03:24.900> you<00:03:25.020> can<00:03:25.200> tell

00:03:25.430 --> 00:03:25.440 
the middle more defined and you can tell

00:03:25.440 --> 00:03:28.370 
the middle more defined and you can tell
up<00:03:25.620> there<00:03:25.830> on<00:03:26.040> the<00:03:26.160> tree<00:03:26.550> that<00:03:27.420> just<00:03:27.720> goes<00:03:27.930> up<00:03:28.230> a

00:03:28.370 --> 00:03:28.380 
up there on the tree that just goes up a

00:03:28.380 --> 00:03:32.930 
up there on the tree that just goes up a
little<00:03:28.590> bit<00:03:28.710> further<00:03:29.390> and<00:03:30.590> stronger<00:03:31.790> star<00:03:32.790> to

00:03:32.930 --> 00:03:32.940 
little bit further and stronger star to

00:03:32.940 --> 00:03:42.260 
little bit further and stronger star to
switch<00:03:33.210> them<00:03:33.480> and<00:03:33.810> see<00:03:39.950> so<00:03:40.950> here's<00:03:41.160> the<00:03:41.340> XT<00:03:41.910> 12

00:03:42.260 --> 00:03:42.270 
switch them and see so here's the XT 12

00:03:42.270 --> 00:03:50.060 
switch them and see so here's the XT 12
up<00:03:42.810> on<00:03:43.080> the<00:03:43.200> tree<00:03:46.490> here<00:03:47.490> is<00:03:47.730> the<00:03:48.060> X<00:03:48.360> T<00:03:49.020> 15<00:03:49.650> up<00:03:49.920> on

00:03:50.060 --> 00:03:50.070 
up on the tree here is the X T 15 up on

00:03:50.070 --> 00:04:05.570 
up on the tree here is the X T 15 up on
the<00:03:50.220> tree

00:04:05.570 --> 00:04:05.580 

00:04:05.580 --> 00:04:08.030 

go<00:04:06.060> ahead<00:04:06.300> and<00:04:06.420> I'll<00:04:06.480> put<00:04:06.690> the<00:04:06.840> Clara's<00:04:07.260> XT<00:04:07.680> 12

00:04:08.030 --> 00:04:08.040 
go ahead and I'll put the Clara's XT 12

00:04:08.040 --> 00:04:10.250 
go ahead and I'll put the Clara's XT 12
aside<00:04:08.459> for<00:04:08.760> right<00:04:08.880> now<00:04:08.940> now<00:04:09.720> being<00:04:09.930> a<00:04:10.050> little

00:04:10.250 --> 00:04:10.260 
aside for right now now being a little

00:04:10.260 --> 00:04:13.309 
aside for right now now being a little
bit<00:04:10.380> bigger<00:04:10.560> than<00:04:10.800> the<00:04:10.980> XT<00:04:11.430> 12<00:04:11.819> the<00:04:12.000> xt<00:04:12.450> 15<00:04:13.020> does

00:04:13.309 --> 00:04:13.319 
bit bigger than the XT 12 the xt 15 does

00:04:13.319 --> 00:04:15.320 
bit bigger than the XT 12 the xt 15 does
have<00:04:13.500> a<00:04:13.530> little<00:04:13.739> bit<00:04:13.860> brighter<00:04:14.400> modes<00:04:14.790> on<00:04:15.060> high

00:04:15.320 --> 00:04:15.330 
have a little bit brighter modes on high

00:04:15.330 --> 00:04:17.180 
have a little bit brighter modes on high
it<00:04:15.390> actually<00:04:15.660> is<00:04:16.019> ten<00:04:16.320> hundred<00:04:16.680> and<00:04:16.829> twenty

00:04:17.180 --> 00:04:17.190 
it actually is ten hundred and twenty

00:04:17.190 --> 00:04:20.750 
it actually is ten hundred and twenty
lumens<00:04:17.730> that's<00:04:18.450> high<00:04:18.690> right<00:04:19.079> there<00:04:19.350> and<00:04:19.760> next

00:04:20.750 --> 00:04:20.760 
lumens that's high right there and next

00:04:20.760 --> 00:04:23.270 
lumens that's high right there and next
we<00:04:20.910> have<00:04:20.940> medium<00:04:21.690> which<00:04:22.200> is<00:04:22.500> two<00:04:22.830> hundred<00:04:23.010> and

00:04:23.270 --> 00:04:23.280 
we have medium which is two hundred and

00:04:23.280 --> 00:04:25.850 
we have medium which is two hundred and
thirty<00:04:23.550> lumens<00:04:24.000> and<00:04:24.240> that's<00:04:24.870> at<00:04:25.080> six<00:04:25.440> hours

00:04:25.850 --> 00:04:25.860 
thirty lumens and that's at six hours

00:04:25.860 --> 00:04:28.220 
thirty lumens and that's at six hours
and<00:04:26.160> then<00:04:26.250> we<00:04:26.310> have<00:04:26.490> low<00:04:26.760> hundred<00:04:27.630> or<00:04:27.870> excuse

00:04:28.220 --> 00:04:28.230 
and then we have low hundred or excuse

00:04:28.230 --> 00:04:30.290 
and then we have low hundred or excuse
me<00:04:28.260> seventeen<00:04:28.950> lumens<00:04:29.400> at<00:04:29.669> a<00:04:29.700> hundred<00:04:30.180> and

00:04:30.290 --> 00:04:30.300 
me seventeen lumens at a hundred and

00:04:30.300 --> 00:04:32.540 
me seventeen lumens at a hundred and
fifty<00:04:30.630> hours<00:04:30.960> and<00:04:31.200> then<00:04:31.680> we<00:04:31.800> have<00:04:31.950> the<00:04:32.130> strobe

00:04:32.540 --> 00:04:32.550 
fifty hours and then we have the strobe

00:04:32.550 --> 00:04:35.300 
fifty hours and then we have the strobe
which<00:04:32.850> is<00:04:33.330> ten<00:04:34.200> hundred<00:04:34.530> and<00:04:34.650> twenty<00:04:34.919> lumens

00:04:35.300 --> 00:04:35.310 
which is ten hundred and twenty lumens

00:04:35.310 --> 00:04:38.750 
which is ten hundred and twenty lumens
and<00:04:35.520> that's<00:04:36.389> at<00:04:36.570> six<00:04:36.870> point<00:04:37.139> three<00:04:37.200> hours<00:04:37.800> so

00:04:38.750 --> 00:04:38.760 
and that's at six point three hours so

00:04:38.760 --> 00:04:42.110 
and that's at six point three hours so
this<00:04:38.970> is<00:04:39.180> a<00:04:39.470> tactical<00:04:40.470> type<00:04:40.770> light<00:04:41.250> to<00:04:41.580> where<00:04:41.820> I

00:04:42.110 --> 00:04:42.120 
this is a tactical type light to where I

00:04:42.120 --> 00:04:44.300 
this is a tactical type light to where I
mean<00:04:42.450> we<00:04:42.720> do<00:04:42.870> have<00:04:42.900> this<00:04:43.260> bezel<00:04:43.560> on<00:04:43.889> the<00:04:44.010> front

00:04:44.300 --> 00:04:44.310 
mean we do have this bezel on the front

00:04:44.310 --> 00:04:47.930 
mean we do have this bezel on the front
the<00:04:44.430> bezel<00:04:44.610> is<00:04:44.970> removable<00:04:45.630> and<00:04:46.040> I<00:04:47.040> mean<00:04:47.700> it<00:04:47.820> can

00:04:47.930 --> 00:04:47.940 
the bezel is removable and I mean it can

00:04:47.940 --> 00:04:49.879 
the bezel is removable and I mean it can
do<00:04:48.120> some<00:04:48.419> protection<00:04:48.930> it's<00:04:49.050> not<00:04:49.200> really<00:04:49.470> sharp

00:04:49.879 --> 00:04:49.889 
do some protection it's not really sharp

00:04:49.889 --> 00:04:52.550 
do some protection it's not really sharp
you<00:04:50.250> know<00:04:50.760> but<00:04:51.150> it<00:04:51.360> will<00:04:51.570> do<00:04:51.780> some<00:04:51.990> damage<00:04:52.020> you

00:04:52.550 --> 00:04:52.560 
you know but it will do some damage you

00:04:52.560 --> 00:04:55.850 
you know but it will do some damage you
could<00:04:52.800> use<00:04:53.040> it<00:04:53.220> as<00:04:53.370> a<00:04:54.270> weapon<00:04:54.540> on<00:04:54.960> the<00:04:55.500> bottom

00:04:55.850 --> 00:04:55.860 
could use it as a weapon on the bottom

00:04:55.860 --> 00:04:57.830 
could use it as a weapon on the bottom
here<00:04:56.070> we<00:04:56.100> do<00:04:56.340> have<00:04:56.370> a<00:04:56.790> mounting<00:04:57.389> that's<00:04:57.750> a

00:04:57.830 --> 00:04:57.840 
here we do have a mounting that's a

00:04:57.840 --> 00:05:01.850 
here we do have a mounting that's a
quarter<00:04:58.110> inch<00:04:58.610> or<00:04:59.610> five<00:04:59.880> eighths<00:05:00.680> mounting<00:05:01.680> so

00:05:01.850 --> 00:05:01.860 
quarter inch or five eighths mounting so

00:05:01.860 --> 00:05:03.110 
quarter inch or five eighths mounting so
we<00:05:01.979> could<00:05:02.100> mount<00:05:02.220> that<00:05:02.430> to<00:05:02.490> the<00:05:02.700> top<00:05:02.880> of<00:05:03.030> a

00:05:03.110 --> 00:05:03.120 
we could mount that to the top of a

00:05:03.120 --> 00:05:06.770 
we could mount that to the top of a
rifle<00:05:03.570> you<00:05:03.690> can<00:05:03.750> top<00:05:03.990> that<00:05:04.169> to<00:05:04.320> a<00:05:05.419> to<00:05:06.419> a<00:05:06.450> tripod

00:05:06.770 --> 00:05:06.780 
rifle you can top that to a to a tripod

00:05:06.780 --> 00:05:09.830 
rifle you can top that to a to a tripod
you<00:05:07.440> mount<00:05:08.070> it<00:05:08.280> to<00:05:08.310> just<00:05:08.970> about<00:05:09.180> whatever<00:05:09.450> you

00:05:09.830 --> 00:05:09.840 
you mount it to just about whatever you

you mount it to just about whatever you
want<00:05:09.870> so<00:05:10.710> we<00:05:11.190> do<00:05:11.340> have<00:05:11.490> that<00:05:11.550> nice<00:05:11.880> cigar<00:05:12.300> grip

00:05:12.590 --> 00:05:12.600 
want so we do have that nice cigar grip

00:05:12.600 --> 00:05:15.620 
want so we do have that nice cigar grip
right<00:05:12.840> there<00:05:13.169> and<00:05:13.610> on<00:05:14.610> that<00:05:14.760> cigar<00:05:15.060> grip<00:05:15.360> we<00:05:15.510> do

00:05:15.620 --> 00:05:15.630 
right there and on that cigar grip we do

00:05:15.630 --> 00:05:18.590 
right there and on that cigar grip we do
have<00:05:15.810> that<00:05:15.990> little<00:05:16.169> hole<00:05:16.970> we<00:05:17.970> can<00:05:18.150> add<00:05:18.360> the

00:05:18.590 --> 00:05:18.600 
have that little hole we can add the

00:05:18.600 --> 00:05:21.320 
have that little hole we can add the
included<00:05:19.289> lanyard<00:05:19.860> it<00:05:20.789> does<00:05:20.940> come<00:05:21.090> with<00:05:21.180> an

00:05:21.320 --> 00:05:21.330 
included lanyard it does come with an

00:05:21.330 --> 00:05:25.430 
included lanyard it does come with an
included<00:05:21.560> lanyard<00:05:22.590> it<00:05:22.800> says<00:05:22.979> Caloris<00:05:24.440> put

00:05:25.430 --> 00:05:25.440 
included lanyard it says Caloris put

00:05:25.440 --> 00:05:27.170 
included lanyard it says Caloris put
that<00:05:25.620> on<00:05:25.830> there<00:05:26.039> below<00:05:26.460> that<00:05:26.700> then<00:05:26.970> on<00:05:27.060> the

00:05:27.170 --> 00:05:27.180 
that on there below that then on the

00:05:27.180 --> 00:05:28.580 
that on there below that then on the
tail<00:05:27.360> cap<00:05:27.600> I<00:05:27.750> guess<00:05:27.870> so<00:05:27.990> we<00:05:28.080> have<00:05:28.169> these<00:05:28.289> two

00:05:28.580 --> 00:05:28.590 
tail cap I guess so we have these two

00:05:28.590 --> 00:05:31.400 
tail cap I guess so we have these two
different<00:05:29.039> tail<00:05:30.030> buttons<00:05:30.870> we<00:05:31.020> have<00:05:31.050> the

00:05:31.400 --> 00:05:31.410 
different tail buttons we have the

00:05:31.410 --> 00:05:33.740 
different tail buttons we have the
momentary<00:05:32.039> or<00:05:32.280> we<00:05:32.370> can<00:05:32.520> full<00:05:32.789> click<00:05:33.150> to<00:05:33.539> turn

00:05:33.740 --> 00:05:33.750 
momentary or we can full click to turn

00:05:33.750 --> 00:05:36.200 
momentary or we can full click to turn
it<00:05:33.930> on<00:05:34.050> and<00:05:34.289> then<00:05:34.919> we<00:05:35.100> have<00:05:35.370> this<00:05:35.669> secondary

00:05:36.200 --> 00:05:36.210 
it on and then we have this secondary

00:05:36.210 --> 00:05:38.360 
it on and then we have this secondary
switch<00:05:36.690> which<00:05:37.139> comes<00:05:37.440> with<00:05:37.530> a<00:05:37.590> little<00:05:37.830> rubber

00:05:38.360 --> 00:05:38.370 
switch which comes with a little rubber

00:05:38.370 --> 00:05:41.990 
switch which comes with a little rubber
cover<00:05:39.120> and<00:05:39.450> that<00:05:40.229> just<00:05:40.500> goes<00:05:40.710> into<00:05:41.039> strobe<00:05:41.430> so

00:05:41.990 --> 00:05:42.000 
cover and that just goes into strobe so

00:05:42.000 --> 00:05:45.080 
cover and that just goes into strobe so
you<00:05:42.150> can<00:05:42.419> do<00:05:42.539> momentary<00:05:43.080> strobe<00:05:43.500> now<00:05:44.130> also<00:05:44.460> if

00:05:45.080 --> 00:05:45.090 
you can do momentary strobe now also if

00:05:45.090 --> 00:05:47.390 
you can do momentary strobe now also if
you<00:05:45.240> do<00:05:45.389> a<00:05:45.419> long<00:05:45.720> press<00:05:45.780> on<00:05:46.470> the<00:05:46.800> strobe<00:05:47.130> I

00:05:47.390 --> 00:05:47.400 
you do a long press on the strobe I

00:05:47.400 --> 00:05:49.400 
you do a long press on the strobe I
think<00:05:47.610> it's<00:05:47.729> more<00:05:47.970> than<00:05:48.120> six<00:05:48.389> seconds<00:05:48.900> and<00:05:49.139> say

00:05:49.400 --> 00:05:49.410 
think it's more than six seconds and say

00:05:49.410 --> 00:05:52.040 
think it's more than six seconds and say
you<00:05:49.470> were<00:05:49.740> to<00:05:49.860> drop<00:05:50.220> the<00:05:50.460> light<00:05:50.780> it's<00:05:51.780> gonna

00:05:52.040 --> 00:05:52.050 
you were to drop the light it's gonna

00:05:52.050 --> 00:05:54.320 
you were to drop the light it's gonna
stay<00:05:52.470> strobing<00:05:53.250> and<00:05:53.400> that's<00:05:53.520> for<00:05:53.760> another<00:05:53.970> six

00:05:54.320 --> 00:05:54.330 
stay strobing and that's for another six

00:05:54.330 --> 00:05:56.390 
stay strobing and that's for another six
hours<00:05:54.750> so<00:05:54.870> that's<00:05:55.020> pretty<00:05:55.320> neat<00:05:55.590> now<00:05:56.130> like<00:05:56.280> I

00:05:56.390 --> 00:05:56.400 
hours so that's pretty neat now like I

00:05:56.400 --> 00:05:58.550 
hours so that's pretty neat now like I
said<00:05:56.610> the<00:05:56.760> momentary<00:05:57.360> you<00:05:57.810> can<00:05:57.930> go<00:05:58.020> momentary

00:05:58.550 --> 00:05:58.560 
said the momentary you can go momentary

00:05:58.560 --> 00:06:01.520 
said the momentary you can go momentary
on<00:05:58.800> momentary<00:05:59.460> off<00:05:59.700> we<00:06:00.510> can<00:06:00.690> full<00:06:00.960> click<00:06:01.289> and

00:06:01.520 --> 00:06:01.530 
on momentary off we can full click and

00:06:01.530 --> 00:06:04.340 
on momentary off we can full click and
then<00:06:01.919> we<00:06:02.010> use<00:06:02.220> that<00:06:02.250> secondary<00:06:03.030> button<00:06:03.330> to<00:06:04.169> go

00:06:04.340 --> 00:06:04.350 
then we use that secondary button to go

00:06:04.350 --> 00:06:09.650 
then we use that secondary button to go
through<00:06:05.450> the<00:06:06.450> different<00:06:06.720> lighting<00:06:07.590> modes<00:06:08.660> at

00:06:09.650 --> 00:06:09.660 
through the different lighting modes at

00:06:09.660 --> 00:06:12.830 
through the different lighting modes at
any<00:06:09.840> time<00:06:10.080> we<00:06:10.260> can<00:06:10.380> hold<00:06:10.590> down<00:06:10.860> and<00:06:11.630> we'll<00:06:12.630> get

00:06:12.830 --> 00:06:12.840 
any time we can hold down and we'll get

00:06:12.840 --> 00:06:17.689 
any time we can hold down and we'll get
that<00:06:13.020> strobe<00:06:13.409> again

00:06:17.689 --> 00:06:17.699 

00:06:17.699 --> 00:06:21.480 

so<00:06:18.699> this<00:06:19.270> does<00:06:19.569> have<00:06:19.870> a<00:06:20.110> dual<00:06:20.680> polarity

00:06:21.480 --> 00:06:21.490 
so this does have a dual polarity

00:06:21.490 --> 00:06:23.189 
so this does have a dual polarity
battery<00:06:21.939> and<00:06:22.120> what<00:06:22.210> I<00:06:22.240> mean<00:06:22.479> by<00:06:22.719> that<00:06:22.749> is

00:06:23.189 --> 00:06:23.199 
battery and what I mean by that is

00:06:23.199 --> 00:06:27.269 
battery and what I mean by that is
there's<00:06:23.800> no<00:06:23.889> rural<00:06:24.539> plus<00:06:25.539> and<00:06:25.930> negative<00:06:26.560> side

00:06:27.269 --> 00:06:27.279 
there's no rural plus and negative side

00:06:27.279 --> 00:06:29.969 
there's no rural plus and negative side
here's<00:06:27.879> the<00:06:28.120> battery<00:06:28.539> it's<00:06:29.139> a<00:06:29.259> Cloris<00:06:29.770> it's

00:06:29.969 --> 00:06:29.979 
here's the battery it's a Cloris it's

00:06:29.979 --> 00:06:35.249 
here's the battery it's a Cloris it's
the<00:06:30.129> k0<00:06:30.870> 618<00:06:31.870> 650<00:06:32.699> 2600<00:06:33.699> milliamp<00:06:33.909> hours<00:06:34.509> 3.7

00:06:35.249 --> 00:06:35.259 
the k0 618 650 2600 milliamp hours 3.7

00:06:35.259 --> 00:06:37.649 
the k0 618 650 2600 milliamp hours 3.7
volts<00:06:35.289> and<00:06:35.710> if<00:06:36.129> we<00:06:36.249> look<00:06:36.460> on<00:06:36.639> the<00:06:36.879> side<00:06:37.180> of<00:06:37.210> both

00:06:37.649 --> 00:06:37.659 
volts and if we look on the side of both

00:06:37.659 --> 00:06:39.540 
volts and if we look on the side of both
of<00:06:37.870> this<00:06:37.990> you<00:06:38.169> can<00:06:38.289> see<00:06:38.499> the<00:06:38.680> sides<00:06:38.979> are<00:06:39.310> the

00:06:39.540 --> 00:06:39.550 
of this you can see the sides are the

00:06:39.550 --> 00:06:42.059 
of this you can see the sides are the
same<00:06:39.580> so<00:06:40.509> it<00:06:40.659> doesn't<00:06:40.930> matter<00:06:41.080> which<00:06:41.379> way<00:06:41.710> I

00:06:42.059 --> 00:06:42.069 
same so it doesn't matter which way I

00:06:42.069 --> 00:06:44.249 
same so it doesn't matter which way I
put<00:06:42.699> the<00:06:42.849> battery<00:06:43.270> in<00:06:43.509> not<00:06:43.870> like<00:06:43.990> it<00:06:44.139> matters

00:06:44.249 --> 00:06:44.259 
put the battery in not like it matters

00:06:44.259 --> 00:06:45.689 
put the battery in not like it matters
anyway<00:06:44.770> because<00:06:44.889> you<00:06:45.039> don't<00:06:45.189> really<00:06:45.340> have<00:06:45.520> to

00:06:45.689 --> 00:06:45.699 
anyway because you don't really have to

00:06:45.699 --> 00:06:47.640 
anyway because you don't really have to
take<00:06:45.819> that<00:06:45.879> battery<00:06:46.419> out<00:06:46.689> because<00:06:47.349> you<00:06:47.499> can

00:06:47.640 --> 00:06:47.650 
take that battery out because you can

00:06:47.650 --> 00:06:54.890 
take that battery out because you can
just<00:06:47.800> throw<00:06:47.979> it<00:06:48.069> on<00:06:48.159> the<00:06:48.279> charger

00:06:54.890 --> 00:06:54.900 

00:06:54.900 --> 00:06:58.499 

now<00:06:55.900> the<00:06:55.960> XT<00:06:56.499> 15<00:06:56.919> does<00:06:57.129> have<00:06:57.279> an<00:06:57.370> IP<00:06:57.520> x8<00:06:58.060> so<00:06:58.449> you

00:06:58.499 --> 00:06:58.509 
now the XT 15 does have an IP x8 so you

00:06:58.509 --> 00:07:01.079 
now the XT 15 does have an IP x8 so you
can<00:06:58.689> totally<00:06:58.900> submerge<00:06:59.409> this<00:06:59.589> underwater<00:07:00.129> 4

00:07:01.079 --> 00:07:01.089 
can totally submerge this underwater 4

00:07:01.089 --> 00:07:04.950 
can totally submerge this underwater 4
or<00:07:01.900> up<00:07:02.229> to<00:07:02.499> 6<00:07:02.860> feet<00:07:02.949> or<00:07:03.279> 2<00:07:03.639> meters<00:07:03.999> and<00:07:04.240> one<00:07:04.870> of

my favorite things about these klaris

00:07:06.669 --> 00:07:09.149 
my favorite things about these klaris
lights<00:07:06.879> is<00:07:07.089> just<00:07:07.360> the<00:07:07.689> the<00:07:08.110> magnetic<00:07:08.589> charging

00:07:09.149 --> 00:07:09.159 
lights is just the the magnetic charging

00:07:09.159 --> 00:07:11.399 
lights is just the the magnetic charging
it<00:07:09.669> just<00:07:09.849> is<00:07:10.060> very<00:07:10.689> convenient<00:07:11.289> you<00:07:11.349> don't

00:07:11.399 --> 00:07:11.409 
it just is very convenient you don't

00:07:11.409 --> 00:07:13.170 
it just is very convenient you don't
really<00:07:11.770> have<00:07:11.949> to<00:07:12.099> get<00:07:12.189> it<00:07:12.310> close<00:07:12.550> it<00:07:12.759> just<00:07:12.909> gets

00:07:13.170 --> 00:07:13.180 
really have to get it close it just gets

00:07:13.180 --> 00:07:16.559 
really have to get it close it just gets
close<00:07:14.139> enough<00:07:14.529> it<00:07:14.740> just<00:07:15.069> jumps<00:07:15.550> to<00:07:15.759> it<00:07:15.909> and<00:07:16.089> you

00:07:16.559 --> 00:07:16.569 
close enough it just jumps to it and you

00:07:16.569 --> 00:07:18.929 
close enough it just jumps to it and you
can<00:07:16.689> see<00:07:16.870> the<00:07:17.020> redness<00:07:17.529> there<00:07:17.830> and<00:07:18.099> when<00:07:18.729> this

00:07:18.929 --> 00:07:18.939 
can see the redness there and when this

00:07:18.939 --> 00:07:21.389 
can see the redness there and when this
turns<00:07:19.300> fully<00:07:20.199> charged<00:07:20.770> it<00:07:20.889> actually<00:07:21.159> turns

00:07:21.389 --> 00:07:21.399 
turns fully charged it actually turns

00:07:21.399 --> 00:07:24.269 
turns fully charged it actually turns
green<00:07:21.759> and<00:07:21.819> it's<00:07:22.120> a<00:07:22.240> nice<00:07:22.479> glowing<00:07:22.960> green<00:07:23.349> so
