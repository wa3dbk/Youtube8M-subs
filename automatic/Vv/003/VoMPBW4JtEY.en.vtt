00:00:03.600 --> 00:00:09.590
 Now it's time for everyone to be healthy again. 

00:00:06.299 --> 00:00:12.840
 you sky and today we have such a release 

00:00:09.590 --> 00:00:14.700
 slender but no less interesting so 

00:00:12.840 --> 00:00:16.650
 let's start with a gun have some kind of gun 

00:00:14.700 --> 00:00:19.500
 then called someman 

00:00:16.650 --> 00:00:20.010
 category arkady don't know who knows that 

00:00:19.500 --> 00:00:25.380
 will understand 

00:00:20.010 --> 00:00:28.260
 so here is such a way 

00:00:25.380 --> 00:00:30.480
 endlessly under this her on new 

00:00:28.260 --> 00:00:32.189
 transport which I will tell later but 

00:00:30.480 --> 00:00:34.469
 slaughter me as we can see 

00:00:32.189 --> 00:00:37.590
 Apparently not very much but she shoots 

00:00:34.469 --> 00:00:39.000
 interesting and endlessly chuck next 

00:00:37.590 --> 00:00:41.309
 gun with 2 

00:00:39.000 --> 00:00:43.110
 Raven is such a fucking 

00:00:41.309 --> 00:00:45.780
 interesting gun than she ahrinno 

00:00:43.110 --> 00:00:48.250
 it's interesting that it is transparent like this 

00:00:45.780 --> 00:00:51.290
 here shoots 

00:00:48.250 --> 00:00:54.410
 well you do have such a personal 

00:00:51.290 --> 00:00:56.270
 unusual but nonetheless that's what 

00:00:54.410 --> 00:00:58.300
 she is transparent it is very interesting such 

00:00:56.270 --> 00:01:01.310
 futuristic interesting cannon 

00:00:58.300 --> 00:01:04.040
 some sensors like that again sight 

00:01:01.310 --> 00:01:08.240
 as if yes ok and the following is with us 

00:01:04.040 --> 00:01:10.070
 es qez online here are the models of weapons 

00:01:08.240 --> 00:01:12.520
 everyone probably knows those who are 

00:01:10.070 --> 00:01:18.440
 played with online I thought you knew 

00:01:12.520 --> 00:01:19.970
 just so at least we'll shoot it like this 

00:01:18.440 --> 00:01:21.680
 recharged that is dumb father 

00:01:19.970 --> 00:01:28.160
 the animation is pretty solid and like that 

00:01:21.680 --> 00:01:32.060
 the following so recharge goes mouth 

00:01:28.160 --> 00:01:33.920
 until you see a given well ka again ie 

00:01:32.060 --> 00:01:34.910
 he sort of throws him 

00:01:33.920 --> 00:01:38.440
 rolls over 

00:01:34.910 --> 00:01:43.409
 throws over the gun after that 

00:01:38.440 --> 00:01:46.329
 takes it oh well so here's a crossbow 

00:01:43.409 --> 00:01:48.850
 I show now just like them 

00:01:46.329 --> 00:01:51.460
 shoot and reload animations just 

00:01:48.850 --> 00:01:57.220
 look further well here it is all 

00:01:51.460 --> 00:02:00.700
 know so why and where I did not understand something 

00:01:57.220 --> 00:02:04.030
 on gone well okay recharge 

00:02:00.700 --> 00:02:06.189
 it happens like this we are not quite 

00:02:04.030 --> 00:02:08.920
 good recharge of course it should 

00:02:06.189 --> 00:02:12.310
 be a leg differently but nonetheless 

00:02:08.920 --> 00:02:14.319
 Here at least so the following is a type of GDP 

00:02:12.310 --> 00:02:16.500
 only in n it is of course as possible 

00:02:14.319 --> 00:02:22.810
 notice redone for some reason 

00:02:16.500 --> 00:02:26.799
 baguyut aim that is such here 

00:02:22.810 --> 00:02:30.580
 I'm pretty cool with the sight of lava. 

00:02:26.799 --> 00:02:39.519
 everyone's next favorite kitaro but all of her 

00:02:30.580 --> 00:02:41.790
 know if she was still publishing more 

00:02:39.519 --> 00:02:44.530
 interesting sounds then there are any 

00:02:41.790 --> 00:02:50.320
 could actually play on it, they 

00:02:44.530 --> 00:02:53.459
 just here recharge cool that's 

00:02:50.320 --> 00:02:53.459
 tune but you understand 

00:02:55.049 --> 00:03:05.109
 economical in the hands of take too cool well 

00:03:01.510 --> 00:03:11.980
 okay next this is with us and since this 

00:03:05.109 --> 00:03:16.430
 bullshit just letting a look here 

00:03:11.980 --> 00:03:21.489
 recharge ie it is 

00:03:16.430 --> 00:03:21.489
 here is a cub that is not clear what 

00:03:24.069 --> 00:03:31.359
 interesting animation is pretty , 

00:03:27.290 --> 00:03:31.359
 bionic cannon next sword 

00:03:34.329 --> 00:03:44.840
 so here's some cool well let's 

00:03:37.879 --> 00:03:46.489
 take that shotgun one more time i 

00:03:44.840 --> 00:03:49.930
 I don't know, but it's also pretty pretty 

00:03:46.489 --> 00:03:49.930
 farther we have m. 

00:03:50.109 --> 00:03:56.030
 look she see some straight above 

00:03:53.930 --> 00:03:57.590
 somehow cold but not clear 

00:03:56.030 --> 00:03:59.959
 which is not just animated estesno 

00:03:57.590 --> 00:04:01.609
 see this here is the animation did not see 

00:03:59.959 --> 00:04:04.579
 such guns actually see these 

00:04:01.609 --> 00:04:06.620
 animations some pastors are very cool 

00:04:04.579 --> 00:04:12.010
 if someone does not see in here so let's 

00:04:06.620 --> 00:04:22.039
 darkness just try unreal cool 

00:04:12.010 --> 00:04:24.229
 very interesting the following too 

00:04:22.039 --> 00:04:27.260
 look at what crystals it changes 

00:04:24.229 --> 00:04:28.940
 it is also very cool very well 

00:04:27.260 --> 00:04:31.840
 interesting animation Well let 

00:04:28.940 --> 00:04:34.820
 let's try it at least for zombies 

00:04:31.840 --> 00:04:39.970
 Well, naturally powerful about what is common here 

00:04:34.820 --> 00:04:39.970
 and a third then to antigoni wardi 

00:04:40.900 --> 00:04:47.539
 that is, I think if with such a gun 

00:04:43.300 --> 00:04:50.479
 against zombies womb no hot to 

00:04:47.539 --> 00:04:52.860
 because exactly released 2 with 

00:04:50.479 --> 00:04:59.789
 half and to whom from this freak 

00:04:52.860 --> 00:05:01.889
 and even three you look okay I think 

00:04:59.789 --> 00:05:05.370
 against forget not hanging and calmly this 

00:05:01.889 --> 00:05:10.620
 the gun worked did the following 

00:05:05.370 --> 00:05:12.900
 weapons this is such a gun that is but 

00:05:10.620 --> 00:05:14.520
 there is nothing but recharging 

00:05:12.900 --> 00:05:17.490
 recharge more interesting to the country again 

00:05:14.520 --> 00:05:20.099
 let's see how he spends and this 

00:05:17.490 --> 00:05:23.280
 moment still going on animation well and so 

00:05:20.099 --> 00:05:28.889
 Finally, once again, well, cool 

00:05:23.280 --> 00:05:32.819
 It is interesting because it is clearly Che bug yet 

00:05:28.889 --> 00:05:34.770
 something so but nothing here 

00:05:32.819 --> 00:05:40.710
 flying orange basically nothing 

00:05:34.770 --> 00:05:44.009
 such they look from the orange bill 

00:05:40.710 --> 00:05:44.520
 still there nifiga ce means it is uber super 

00:05:44.009 --> 00:05:47.879
 mega 

00:05:44.520 --> 00:05:54.270
 flax doctors I cannon and the last one 

00:05:47.879 --> 00:05:57.990
 Generally slingshot naturally she of course 

00:05:54.270 --> 00:06:01.770
 But if you hold it, nothing happens 

00:05:57.990 --> 00:06:02.729
 just country balls okay so a couple 

00:06:01.770 --> 00:06:05.279
 that 's all for today 

00:06:02.729 --> 00:06:07.440
 so go to this and then again 

00:06:05.279 --> 00:06:09.509
 the same if the gulf of such a tank 

00:06:07.440 --> 00:06:13.050
 I 'll show you what he looks like. 

00:06:09.509 --> 00:06:15.839
 tank is a tank in the first version here is 2 by 2 

00:06:13.050 --> 00:06:19.560
 I showed it so I think it is not necessary 2 

00:06:15.839 --> 00:06:21.089
 firing rockets like a bazooka not all that 

00:06:19.560 --> 00:06:23.250
 that there is a machine gun you can not even pay 

00:06:21.089 --> 00:06:25.259
 attention well then we sit here let's 

00:06:23.250 --> 00:06:29.069
 once again let's go around it let's see visually 

00:06:25.259 --> 00:06:31.220
 I hope everyone understands what it is 

00:06:29.069 --> 00:06:35.850
 so here 

00:06:31.220 --> 00:06:39.060
 we are naturally this gauss gun that is he 

00:06:35.850 --> 00:06:42.540
 You see, and whom you see the tank steering wheel 

00:06:39.060 --> 00:06:45.150
 rotates what's actually cool well 

00:06:42.540 --> 00:06:47.880
 he looked like this these wheels 

00:06:45.150 --> 00:06:50.390
 armored something like robocraft 

00:06:47.880 --> 00:06:53.400
 ovsky yes it looks very cool 

00:06:50.390 --> 00:06:55.430
 slowly and really they looked clicked 

00:06:53.400 --> 00:06:57.510
 shift and he began to accelerate a little 

00:06:55.430 --> 00:07:00.090
 it means that this is natural here 

00:06:57.510 --> 00:07:02.490
 speeding up work but here is a good one and 

00:07:00.090 --> 00:07:06.180
 interesting tanchik cool in principle 

00:07:02.490 --> 00:07:08.190
 okay so take it you can fasten about 

00:07:06.180 --> 00:07:10.800
 it is impossible when we remove naturally 

00:07:08.190 --> 00:07:13.050
 it is not clear what kind of cubes to see 

00:07:10.800 --> 00:07:16.050
 around him some cubes probably this 

00:07:13.050 --> 00:07:20.550
 just some hidden parts 

00:07:16.050 --> 00:07:21.750
 well without gun we can do it without 

00:07:20.550 --> 00:07:24.170
 guns while 

00:07:21.750 --> 00:07:26.790
 much like you still have forest 

00:07:24.170 --> 00:07:28.830
 control I do not know this is a function 

00:07:26.790 --> 00:07:33.180
 I honestly did not learn to manage either 

00:07:28.830 --> 00:07:35.160
 and work okay so everyone everything 

00:07:33.180 --> 00:07:37.200
 thank you all for now so short 

00:07:35.160 --> 00:07:41.840
 release but no less interesting guns 

00:07:37.200 --> 00:07:41.840
 were so give a handicap friends thanks
