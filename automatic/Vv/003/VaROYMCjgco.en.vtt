00:00:00.370 --> 00:00:06.669
 to make the openwork point of this 

00:00:03.070 --> 00:00:10.120
 you are going to start knitting 

00:00:06.669 --> 00:00:13.480
 a first row always with a point 

00:00:10.120 --> 00:00:17.210
 of shore beginning and end two points 

00:00:13.480 --> 00:00:21.759
 together and a loop 

00:00:17.210 --> 00:00:21.759
 the whole row without separation 

00:00:22.570 --> 00:00:28.869
 in this way they are taking two points 

00:00:24.970 --> 00:00:30.370
 together to the right and then a 

00:00:28.869 --> 00:00:34.160
 laced 

00:00:30.370 --> 00:00:36.739
 two stitches together the lazada 

00:00:34.160 --> 00:00:39.890
 we perform it as if we had the 

00:00:36.739 --> 00:00:43.910
 strand between the two needles to weave at 

00:00:39.890 --> 00:00:47.989
 setback but we come back down from this 

00:00:43.910 --> 00:00:52.329
 way we are left with a two loop 

00:00:47.989 --> 00:00:55.620
 points together and a loop 

00:00:52.329 --> 00:00:55.620
 the whole row 

00:00:55.960 --> 00:01:01.180
 to the right 

00:00:57.770 --> 00:01:03.730
 and we finish with a 

00:01:01.180 --> 00:01:06.760
 the loop and a point of origin not 

00:01:03.730 --> 00:01:09.430
 forget to always perform in all 

00:01:06.760 --> 00:01:11.140
 points a beginning edge point and 

00:01:09.430 --> 00:01:15.180
 final 

00:01:11.140 --> 00:01:18.540
 We are going to knit the stitches 

00:01:15.180 --> 00:01:22.500
 how they present themselves in this case upside down 

00:01:18.540 --> 00:01:26.600
 and do not forget to weave the loops you 

00:01:22.500 --> 00:01:28.939
 they will find them crossed 

00:01:26.600 --> 00:01:31.070
 and do not forget to weave them because they're going away 

00:01:28.939 --> 00:01:33.740
 to decrease the points and we are not going to 

00:01:31.070 --> 00:01:35.509
 can perform the draft as they are 

00:01:33.740 --> 00:01:40.430
 these ones that form it 

00:01:35.509 --> 00:01:42.690
 in this way we weave the row of the 

00:01:40.430 --> 00:01:45.810
 reverse 

00:01:42.690 --> 00:01:47.390
 and to interject these drafts that do not 

00:01:45.810 --> 00:01:50.600
 let's stay 

00:01:47.390 --> 00:01:55.040
 and I make the fabric diagonally in the 

00:01:50.600 --> 00:01:58.090
 next turn we are going to invest the 

00:01:55.040 --> 00:02:02.510
 shore point and we will perform 

00:01:58.090 --> 00:02:06.190
 first the loop and then a 

00:02:02.510 --> 00:02:06.190
 simple decrease 

00:02:06.220 --> 00:02:10.740
 the loop and a decrease 

00:02:11.300 --> 00:02:17.350
 in this way laced like the 

00:02:14.780 --> 00:02:21.080
 another turn and the simple decrease 

00:02:17.350 --> 00:02:24.980
 removing the first point by passing it without 

00:02:21.080 --> 00:02:29.420
 have knitting the second one and crossing 

00:02:24.980 --> 00:02:31.400
 this point by the on the previous one that 

00:02:29.420 --> 00:02:34.670
 we achieved with this we achieved a 

00:02:31.400 --> 00:02:36.620
 different inclination to the colon 

00:02:34.670 --> 00:02:39.830
 together 

00:02:36.620 --> 00:02:43.220
 we also reduce a point but 

00:02:39.830 --> 00:02:46.130
 we achieve a different inclination 

00:02:43.220 --> 00:02:49.640
 in this way they are doing all this 

00:02:46.130 --> 00:02:51.220
 row and they will intersperse these two 

00:02:49.640 --> 00:02:54.520
 rows 

00:02:51.220 --> 00:02:58.720
 remember that in the graphic they go 

00:02:54.520 --> 00:03:01.790
 to have an intermediate row if of 

00:02:58.720 --> 00:03:05.780
 right point 

00:03:01.790 --> 00:03:07.129
 that way they will make the whole row until 

00:03:05.780 --> 00:03:10.730
 the end 

00:03:07.129 --> 00:03:13.640
 in this way we finish our 

00:03:10.730 --> 00:03:16.250
 sample remember to weave the return of the 

00:03:13.640 --> 00:03:20.650
 backhand and make an intermediate return 

00:03:16.250 --> 00:03:20.650
 right knit
