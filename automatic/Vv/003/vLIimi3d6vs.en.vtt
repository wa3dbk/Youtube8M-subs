00:01:44.870 --> 00:01:44.880 
some slip before it kills the power and

00:01:44.880 --> 00:01:47.270 
some slip before it kills the power and
then<00:01:45.299> of<00:01:45.390> course<00:01:45.600> you<00:01:45.720> can<00:01:45.840> turn<00:01:45.960> it<00:01:46.110> off<00:01:46.280> this

00:01:47.270 --> 00:01:47.280

some<00:02:21.060> adjustability<00:02:21.570> on<00:02:21.780> the<00:02:21.900> zx10<00:02:22.440> you<00:02:22.590> can

00:02:22.730 --> 00:02:22.740 
some adjustability on the zx10 you can

00:02:22.740 --> 00:02:26.210 
some adjustability on the zx10 you can
move<00:02:22.920> the<00:02:23.160> foot<00:02:24.120> peg<00:02:24.300> brackets<00:02:24.840> down<00:02:25.560> about<00:02:25.950> 10

00:02:26.210 --> 00:02:26.220 
move the foot peg brackets down about 10

00:02:26.220 --> 00:02:28.490 
move the foot peg brackets down about 10
millimeters<00:02:26.520> or<00:02:26.910> so<00:02:27.120> so<00:02:27.960> you<00:02:28.050> can<00:02:28.140> move<00:02:28.230> down

00:02:28.490 --> 00:02:28.500 
millimeters or so so you can move down

00:02:28.500 --> 00:02:34.250 
millimeters or so so you can move down
there<00:02:28.680> in<00:02:28.740> the<00:02:28.830> out<00:02:28.950> position<00:02:29.460> now<00:02:32.960> let's<00:02:33.960> see

00:02:34.250 --> 00:02:34.260 
there in the out position now let's see

00:02:34.260 --> 00:02:38.090 
there in the out position now let's see
what<00:02:34.560> else<00:02:35.630> good<00:02:36.630> wind<00:02:36.840> protection<00:02:37.410> this<00:02:37.890> has

00:02:38.090 --> 00:02:38.100 
what else good wind protection this has

00:02:38.100 --> 00:02:40.390 
what else good wind protection this has
an<00:02:38.220> electronic<00:02:38.790> steering<00:02:39.090> jammer<00:02:39.540> from<00:02:39.720> Owens

00:02:40.390 --> 00:02:40.400 
an electronic steering jammer from Owens

00:02:40.400 --> 00:02:44.560 
an electronic steering jammer from Owens
and<00:02:41.400> so<00:02:41.850> the<00:02:42.330> steering<00:02:42.660> captain<00:02:42.990> of<00:02:43.110> limits

00:02:44.560 --> 00:02:44.570 
and so the steering captain of limits

00:02:44.570 --> 00:02:47.390 
and so the steering captain of limits
like<00:02:45.570> you<00:02:45.720> get<00:02:45.840> a<00:02:45.870> high<00:02:46.050> speed<00:02:46.350> wobble<00:02:46.800> this

00:02:47.390 --> 00:02:47.400 
like you get a high speed wobble this

00:02:47.400 --> 00:02:48.620 
like you get a high speed wobble this
would<00:02:47.670> keep<00:02:47.820> that<00:02:48.060> from<00:02:48.240> getting<00:02:48.270> out<00:02:48.600> of

00:02:48.620 --> 00:02:48.630 
would keep that from getting out of

00:02:48.630 --> 00:02:50.750 
would keep that from getting out of
control<00:02:48.720> hopefully<00:02:49.500> and<00:02:49.709> this<00:02:50.430> is

00:02:50.750 --> 00:02:50.760 
control hopefully and this is

00:02:50.760 --> 00:02:54.110 
control hopefully and this is
electronically<00:02:51.800> controlled<00:02:52.800> so<00:02:53.580> at<00:02:53.910> higher

00:02:54.110 --> 00:02:54.120 
electronically controlled so at higher

00:02:54.120 --> 00:02:55.550 
electronically controlled so at higher
speed<00:02:54.510> this<00:02:54.720> is<00:02:54.870> going<00:02:55.020> to<00:02:55.080> be<00:02:55.140> tighter<00:02:55.410> than

00:02:55.550 --> 00:02:55.560 
speed this is going to be tighter than

00:02:55.560 --> 00:02:57.380 
speed this is going to be tighter than
it<00:02:55.770> is<00:02:55.860> at<00:02:56.010> lower<00:02:56.130> speed<00:02:56.490> you're<00:02:57.209> going<00:02:57.330> to

00:02:57.380 --> 00:02:57.390 
it is at lower speed you're going to

00:02:57.390 --> 00:02:59.870 
it is at lower speed you're going to
need<00:02:57.480> more<00:02:57.630> dampening<00:02:58.050> at<00:02:58.170> high<00:02:58.350> speed<00:02:58.880> great

00:02:59.870 --> 00:02:59.880 
need more dampening at high speed great

00:02:59.880 --> 00:03:01.850 
need more dampening at high speed great

00:03:31.580 --> 00:03:31.590 
blue modems swingarm let's take a look

00:03:31.590 --> 00:03:36.870 
blue modems swingarm let's take a look
at<00:03:31.709> this<00:03:31.830> side<00:03:32.040> of<00:03:32.130> the<00:03:32.190> bike

00:03:36.870 --> 00:03:36.880 

00:03:36.880 --> 00:03:38.610 

but<00:03:37.480> the<00:03:37.570> bichri<00:03:37.870> looks<00:03:38.020> head<00:03:38.170> I<00:03:38.200> guess<00:03:38.440> this

00:03:38.610 --> 00:03:38.620 
but the bichri looks head I guess this

00:03:38.620 --> 00:03:40.170 
but the bichri looks head I guess this
Pike<00:03:38.800> is<00:03:38.950> really<00:03:39.160> kind<00:03:39.370> of<00:03:39.430> a<00:03:39.490> combination<00:03:39.790> of

00:03:40.170 --> 00:03:40.180 
Pike is really kind of a combination of

00:03:40.180 --> 00:03:43.290 
Pike is really kind of a combination of
this<00:03:40.390> matte<00:03:40.960> black<00:03:41.260> and<00:03:41.560> kind<00:03:41.680> of<00:03:41.830> this<00:03:42.300> black

00:03:43.290 --> 00:03:43.300 
this matte black and kind of this black

00:03:43.300 --> 00:03:45.900 
this matte black and kind of this black
or<00:03:43.570> gray<00:03:43.810> color<00:03:44.110> and<00:03:45.040> so<00:03:45.400> it's<00:03:45.550> just<00:03:45.700> a<00:03:45.790> little

00:03:45.900 --> 00:03:45.910 
or gray color and so it's just a little

00:03:45.910 --> 00:03:47.670 
or gray color and so it's just a little
bit<00:03:46.090> of<00:03:46.180> contrast<00:03:46.660> in<00:03:46.930> some<00:03:47.110> places<00:03:47.320> on<00:03:47.500> the

00:03:47.670 --> 00:03:47.680 
bit of contrast in some places on the

00:03:47.680 --> 00:03:50.460 
bit of contrast in some places on the
bike<00:03:47.890> but<00:03:48.760> it's<00:03:48.910> almost<00:03:49.120> like<00:03:49.360> two<00:03:49.630> two<00:03:50.170> shades

00:03:50.460 --> 00:03:50.470 
bike but it's almost like two two shades

00:03:50.470 --> 00:03:52.080 
bike but it's almost like two two shades
of<00:03:50.650> black<00:03:50.890> it<00:03:51.160> really<00:03:51.190> gives<00:03:51.670> a<00:03:51.760> bike<00:03:51.910> little

00:03:52.080 --> 00:03:52.090 
of black it really gives a bike little

00:03:52.090 --> 00:04:01.869 
of black it really gives a bike little
character<00:03:53.970> really<00:03:54.970> looks<00:03:55.210> nice

00:04:01.869 --> 00:04:01.879 

00:04:01.879 --> 00:04:03.580 

great<00:04:02.450> looking<00:04:02.689> touches<00:04:03.110> like<00:04:03.230> the<00:04:03.379> little

00:04:03.580 --> 00:04:03.590 
great looking touches like the little

00:04:03.590 --> 00:04:06.509 
great looking touches like the little
ninja<00:04:03.890> logo<00:04:04.280> embossed<00:04:04.610> on<00:04:04.879> the<00:04:04.939> rear<00:04:05.180> seat

00:04:06.509 --> 00:04:06.519

this bike is if you'd like to the track
days<00:04:09.340> the<00:04:10.340> turn<00:04:10.790> signals<00:04:11.120> are<00:04:11.209> built<00:04:11.390> in<00:04:11.569> the

00:04:11.649 --> 00:04:11.659 
days the turn signals are built in the

00:04:11.659 --> 00:04:13.899 
days the turn signals are built in the
mirror<00:04:11.870> so<00:04:12.079> you<00:04:12.230> undo<00:04:12.500> these<00:04:12.620> two<00:04:12.680> screws<00:04:12.909> pull

00:04:13.899 --> 00:04:13.909 
mirror so you undo these two screws pull

00:04:13.909 --> 00:04:15.999 
mirror so you undo these two screws pull
this<00:04:14.030> out<00:04:14.269> there's<00:04:14.569> a<00:04:14.629> plug<00:04:14.870> right<00:04:14.900> here<00:04:15.560> and

00:04:15.999 --> 00:04:16.009 
this out there's a plug right here and

00:04:16.009 --> 00:04:17.439
