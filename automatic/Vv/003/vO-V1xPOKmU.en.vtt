hey it's jen here from ultimate RC calm
just<00:00:11.070> drive<00:00:11.520> in<00:00:11.730> the<00:00:11.940> x<00:00:12.270> TM<00:00:12.720> rail<00:00:13.290> on<00:00:13.590> 2s<00:00:14.220> yes

00:00:14.720 --> 00:00:14.730 
just drive in the x TM rail on 2s yes

00:00:14.730 --> 00:00:16.849 
just drive in the x TM rail on 2s yes
just<00:00:15.030> seven<00:00:15.360> point<00:00:15.600> four<00:00:15.780> volts<00:00:15.990> this<00:00:16.680> is<00:00:16.830> a

00:00:16.849 --> 00:00:16.859 
just seven point four volts this is a

00:00:16.859 --> 00:00:19.189 
just seven point four volts this is a
one-eighth-scale<00:00:17.730> vehicle<00:00:18.570> normal

00:00:19.189 --> 00:00:19.199 
one-eighth-scale vehicle normal

00:00:19.199 --> 00:00:21.109 
one-eighth-scale vehicle normal
one-eighth-scale<00:00:19.710> size<00:00:20.160> but<00:00:20.880> it<00:00:20.970> is

00:00:21.109 --> 00:00:21.119 
one-eighth-scale size but it is

00:00:21.119 --> 00:00:24.109 
one-eighth-scale size but it is
perfectly<00:00:21.750> capable<00:00:22.020> of<00:00:22.440> being<00:00:22.650> run<00:00:22.949> on<00:00:23.190> just<00:00:23.640> a

00:00:24.109 --> 00:00:24.119 
perfectly capable of being run on just a

00:00:24.119 --> 00:00:26.990 
perfectly capable of being run on just a
single<00:00:24.180> 2's<00:00:25.130> battery<00:00:26.130> pack<00:00:26.369> so<00:00:26.610> I<00:00:26.640> figured

00:00:26.990 --> 00:00:27.000 
single 2's battery pack so I figured

00:00:27.000 --> 00:00:29.060 
single 2's battery pack so I figured
that<00:00:27.150> I<00:00:27.180> would<00:00:27.300> try<00:00:27.690> it<00:00:27.750> out<00:00:27.990> with<00:00:28.260> that<00:00:28.740> just

00:00:29.060 --> 00:00:29.070 
that I would try it out with that just

00:00:29.070 --> 00:00:30.890 
that I would try it out with that just
for<00:00:29.250> starters<00:00:29.430> this<00:00:29.789> is<00:00:29.910> my<00:00:30.150> very<00:00:30.480> first<00:00:30.660> time

00:00:30.890 --> 00:00:30.900 
for starters this is my very first time

00:00:30.900 --> 00:00:33.650 
for starters this is my very first time
driving<00:00:31.199> it<00:00:31.440> and<00:00:31.910> also<00:00:32.910> I<00:00:33.090> know<00:00:33.239> that<00:00:33.510> there

00:00:33.650 --> 00:00:33.660 
driving it and also I know that there

00:00:33.660 --> 00:00:36.139 
driving it and also I know that there
are<00:00:33.690> some<00:00:34.050> hobbyist<00:00:34.440> out<00:00:34.620> there<00:00:34.890> who<00:00:35.640> are<00:00:35.670> not

00:00:36.139 --> 00:00:36.149 
are some hobbyist out there who are not

00:00:36.149 --> 00:00:37.880 
are some hobbyist out there who are not
hardcore<00:00:36.479> yet<00:00:36.960> we<00:00:37.170> might<00:00:37.409> have<00:00:37.589> a<00:00:37.620> lot<00:00:37.859> of

00:00:37.880 --> 00:00:37.890 
hardcore yet we might have a lot of

00:00:37.890 --> 00:00:41.059 
hardcore yet we might have a lot of
one-tenth<00:00:38.550> scale<00:00:38.640> vehicles<00:00:39.179> or<00:00:39.960> might<00:00:40.679> have<00:00:40.829> a

00:00:41.059 --> 00:00:41.069 
one-tenth scale vehicles or might have a

00:00:41.069 --> 00:00:43.340 
one-tenth scale vehicles or might have a
1-10<00:00:41.519> scale<00:00:41.550> vehicle<00:00:42.239> and<00:00:42.449> not<00:00:42.659> have<00:00:42.929> two

00:00:43.340 --> 00:00:43.350 
1-10 scale vehicle and not have two

00:00:43.350 --> 00:00:47.689 
1-10 scale vehicle and not have two
matched<00:00:44.659> identical<00:00:45.659> to<00:00:45.989> cell<00:00:46.289> lipo<00:00:47.010> packs<00:00:47.399> or

00:00:47.689 --> 00:00:47.699 
matched identical to cell lipo packs or

00:00:47.699 --> 00:00:50.599 
matched identical to cell lipo packs or
might<00:00:47.940> not<00:00:47.969> want<00:00:48.420> to<00:00:48.629> yet<00:00:48.989> by<00:00:49.260> a<00:00:49.620> big<00:00:50.039> ol<00:00:50.219> brick

00:00:50.599 --> 00:00:50.609 
might not want to yet by a big ol brick

00:00:50.609 --> 00:00:53.439 
might not want to yet by a big ol brick
of<00:00:50.789> a<00:00:50.940> Korres<00:00:51.719> pack<00:00:52.079> which<00:00:52.350> costs<00:00:52.799> a<00:00:52.949> lot<00:00:53.100> more

00:00:53.439 --> 00:00:53.449 
of a Korres pack which costs a lot more

00:00:53.449 --> 00:00:56.930 
of a Korres pack which costs a lot more
so<00:00:54.449> here<00:00:54.929> is<00:00:55.170> what<00:00:56.010> the<00:00:56.219> vehicle<00:00:56.639> will<00:00:56.789> look

00:00:56.930 --> 00:00:56.940 
so here is what the vehicle will look

00:00:56.940 --> 00:00:58.819 
so here is what the vehicle will look
like<00:00:57.120> being<00:00:57.479> driven<00:00:57.690> around<00:00:57.870> with<00:00:58.350> just<00:00:58.679> your

00:00:58.819 --> 00:00:58.829 
like being driven around with just your

00:00:58.829 --> 00:01:02.229 
like being driven around with just your
regular<00:00:59.039> one-tenth<00:00:59.850> scale<00:01:00.289> sized<00:01:01.289> lipo<00:01:01.979> pack

00:01:02.229 --> 00:01:02.239 
regular one-tenth scale sized lipo pack

00:01:02.239 --> 00:01:05.180 
regular one-tenth scale sized lipo pack
definitely<00:01:03.239> not<00:01:03.629> very<00:01:04.049> fast<00:01:04.409> on<00:01:04.619> the<00:01:04.739> top<00:01:04.949> end

00:01:05.180 --> 00:01:05.190 
definitely not very fast on the top end

00:01:05.190 --> 00:01:07.550 
definitely not very fast on the top end
but<00:01:05.549> it's<00:01:05.729> not<00:01:06.090> super<00:01:06.570> slow<00:01:06.810> either<00:01:06.990> and<00:01:07.320> you

00:01:07.550 --> 00:01:07.560 
but it's not super slow either and you

00:01:07.560 --> 00:01:09.530 
but it's not super slow either and you
know<00:01:07.650> you're<00:01:07.830> able<00:01:08.100> to<00:01:08.220> get<00:01:08.370> around<00:01:08.540> pretty

00:01:09.530 --> 00:01:09.540 
know you're able to get around pretty

00:01:09.540 --> 00:01:12.620 
know you're able to get around pretty
decently<00:01:10.080> it<00:01:10.230> still<00:01:10.500> does<00:01:10.680> have<00:01:10.890> a<00:01:11.130> a<00:01:11.630> pretty

00:01:12.620 --> 00:01:12.630 
decently it still does have a a pretty

00:01:12.630 --> 00:01:14.960 
decently it still does have a a pretty
decently<00:01:13.080> strong<00:01:13.200> motor<00:01:14.160> on<00:01:14.370> it<00:01:14.400> and<00:01:14.730> it<00:01:14.850> is

00:01:14.960 --> 00:01:14.970 
decently strong motor on it and it is

00:01:14.970 --> 00:01:18.770 
decently strong motor on it and it is
geared<00:01:15.510> to<00:01:15.810> go<00:01:15.960> pretty<00:01:16.230> fast<00:01:16.530> so<00:01:16.980> on<00:01:17.430> 2s<00:01:18.330> you're

00:01:18.770 --> 00:01:18.780 
geared to go pretty fast so on 2s you're

00:01:18.780 --> 00:01:20.750 
geared to go pretty fast so on 2s you're
going<00:01:18.900> to<00:01:18.960> be<00:01:19.080> able<00:01:19.110> to<00:01:19.320> get<00:01:19.470> it<00:01:19.590> to<00:01:19.620> go<00:01:19.890> between

00:01:20.750 --> 00:01:20.760 
going to be able to get it to go between

00:01:20.760 --> 00:01:23.990 
going to be able to get it to go between
20<00:01:21.540> and<00:01:21.570> 25<00:01:21.950> miles<00:01:22.950> per<00:01:23.130> hour<00:01:23.370> i<00:01:23.520> think<00:01:23.670> closer

00:01:23.990 --> 00:01:24.000 
20 and 25 miles per hour i think closer

00:01:24.000 --> 00:01:27.530 
20 and 25 miles per hour i think closer
to<00:01:24.270> the<00:01:24.420> 25<00:01:25.020> miles<00:01:25.320> per<00:01:25.470> hour<00:01:25.820> side<00:01:26.820> of<00:01:26.970> it<00:01:27.090> this

00:01:27.530 --> 00:01:27.540 
to the 25 miles per hour side of it this

00:01:27.540 --> 00:01:30.800 
to the 25 miles per hour side of it this
is<00:01:27.750> one<00:01:27.990> hundred<00:01:28.170> percent<00:01:28.350> bone<00:01:29.220> stock<00:01:30.090> so

00:01:30.800 --> 00:01:30.810 
is one hundred percent bone stock so

00:01:30.810 --> 00:01:32.600 
is one hundred percent bone stock so
i've<00:01:30.900> got<00:01:30.930> those<00:01:31.230> stock<00:01:31.710> tires<00:01:32.010> on<00:01:32.370> there

00:01:32.600 --> 00:01:32.610 
i've got those stock tires on there

00:01:32.610 --> 00:01:34.700 
i've got those stock tires on there
which<00:01:32.850> are<00:01:33.180> really<00:01:33.870> not<00:01:34.110> made<00:01:34.440> for

00:01:34.700 --> 00:01:34.710 
which are really not made for

00:01:34.710 --> 00:01:36.890 
which are really not made for
off-roading<00:01:35.340> but<00:01:35.760> with<00:01:36.270> this<00:01:36.420> little<00:01:36.630> power

00:01:36.890 --> 00:01:36.900 
off-roading but with this little power

00:01:36.900 --> 00:01:39.770 
off-roading but with this little power
you're<00:01:37.380> really<00:01:37.680> not<00:01:37.890> able<00:01:38.100> to<00:01:38.490> overpower<00:01:38.970> the

00:01:39.770 --> 00:01:39.780 
you're really not able to overpower the

00:01:39.780 --> 00:01:42.830 
you're really not able to overpower the
tires<00:01:40.020> that<00:01:40.560> much<00:01:40.860> so<00:01:41.700> sure<00:01:42.120> to<00:01:42.420> watch<00:01:42.810> for

00:01:42.830 --> 00:01:42.840 
tires that much so sure to watch for

00:01:42.840 --> 00:01:46.880 
tires that much so sure to watch for
