00:00:22.420 --> 00:00:26.590
 frozen water received a few days ago and 

00:00:24.580 --> 00:00:27.849
 and then I have put them aside 

00:00:26.590 --> 00:00:29.260
 but I'm still looking forward to discovering 

00:00:27.849 --> 00:00:31.060
 what's inside 

00:00:29.260 --> 00:00:33.640
 so it contains a map 

00:00:31.060 --> 00:00:36.070
 holographic with what waters as well 

00:00:33.640 --> 00:00:39.730
 only four booster and a code card 

00:00:36.070 --> 00:00:40.870
 for pokémon online then let's discover 

00:00:39.730 --> 00:00:44.860
 still quickly what is around 

00:00:40.870 --> 00:00:47.800
 with one who would have her waters and a 

00:00:44.860 --> 00:00:50.800
 another who would have even and still 

00:00:47.800 --> 00:00:53.880
 nice this poke box let's see and 

00:00:50.800 --> 00:01:00.399
 let 's open it 

00:00:53.880 --> 00:01:05.170

00:01:00.399 --> 00:01:06.789
 those who shows here the three cards 

00:01:05.170 --> 00:01:11.170
 specials that you can have in the 

00:01:06.789 --> 00:01:12.039
 poké boxing here I put aside a little 

00:01:11.170 --> 00:01:13.300
 more common but it's true she 

00:01:12.039 --> 00:01:15.430
 is really beautiful the colors are 

00:01:13.300 --> 00:01:17.350
 pretty they roll out really great 

00:01:15.430 --> 00:01:19.360
 above I like this little foal he 

00:01:17.350 --> 00:01:21.819
 is adorable and there I just saw that 

00:01:19.360 --> 00:01:23.759
 l have ever have during transport it 

00:01:21.819 --> 00:01:26.069
 taken a bad forehand it's a shame 

00:01:23.759 --> 00:01:28.149
 it's really a shame 

00:01:26.069 --> 00:01:30.069
 I will try to repair but to my 

00:01:28.149 --> 00:01:32.200
 opinion it would surprise me game plus do some 

00:01:30.069 --> 00:01:35.009
 damage than anything else go opening all 

00:01:32.200 --> 00:01:35.009
 right away this wonder 

00:01:35.220 --> 00:01:41.880
 yes but the wings and 2 through a joy 

00:01:38.170 --> 00:01:44.319
 that she really took a hell of a paw 

00:01:41.880 --> 00:01:47.440
 go a little to dreuz as we say it to 

00:01:44.319 --> 00:01:50.140
 good donations it's okay but it's a 

00:01:47.440 --> 00:01:54.610
 little damage anyway the card she 

00:01:50.140 --> 00:01:57.300
 0 to go super anyway to her is 

00:01:54.610 --> 00:02:00.700
 really bright 

00:01:57.300 --> 00:02:02.759
 I love it, it's superb, I'll give it to you 

00:02:00.700 --> 00:02:05.560

00:02:02.759 --> 00:02:07.060
 what ego is nice but good on this 

00:02:05.560 --> 00:02:09.220
 drawing anyway it looks like he has a 

00:02:07.060 --> 00:02:11.709
 little dildo on the head but set to 

00:02:09.220 --> 00:02:15.310
 the card is beautiful like that 

00:02:11.709 --> 00:02:17.650
 go I will not quibble either the code 

00:02:15.310 --> 00:02:21.310
 online and it's a gift 

00:02:17.650 --> 00:02:21.900
 go backwards it's harder and good 

00:02:21.310 --> 00:02:25.739
 luck 

00:02:21.900 --> 00:02:28.329
 I put it here the boosters then 

00:02:25.739 --> 00:02:31.030
 so we have a black booster and 

00:02:28.329 --> 00:02:34.810
 white noble victory 

00:02:31.030 --> 00:02:40.659
 cimpor another of the series would have 

00:02:34.810 --> 00:02:42.280
 white touvres emerging a third on 

00:02:40.659 --> 00:02:47.140
 black and white power emerging still 

00:02:42.280 --> 00:02:49.590
 once is the fourth would not white 

00:02:47.140 --> 00:02:52.000
 crossed border 

00:02:49.590 --> 00:02:54.840
 go I start with the last game 

00:02:52.000 --> 00:02:54.840
 but skin boxing here 

00:02:55.439 --> 00:02:59.920
 let's start right now so not black 

00:02:57.700 --> 00:03:02.650

00:02:59.920 --> 00:03:04.629

00:03:02.650 --> 00:03:06.099
 the fifth generation wood the 

00:03:04.629 --> 00:03:06.849
 fifth generation let's say she 

00:03:06.099 --> 00:03:08.829
 is not my favorite 

00:03:06.849 --> 00:03:10.719
 so I did not go back to 

00:03:08.829 --> 00:03:12.790
 name of three quarters of the pokemon so 

00:03:10.719 --> 00:03:15.790
