map I updated it so it now works so

00:00:30.060 --> 00:00:34.100 
map I updated it so it now works so
here's<00:00:30.330> the<00:00:30.449> old<00:00:30.630> version<00:00:31.910> and<00:00:32.910> you<00:00:33.780> see<00:00:33.989> you

00:00:34.100 --> 00:00:34.110 
here's the old version and you see you

00:00:34.110 --> 00:00:37.150 
here's the old version and you see you
get<00:00:34.260> into<00:00:34.500> this<00:00:34.620> room<00:00:34.890> and<00:00:35.190> if<00:00:35.940> you<00:00:36.210> were<00:00:36.390> ever

00:00:37.150 --> 00:00:37.160 
get into this room and if you were ever

00:00:37.160 --> 00:00:42.590 
get into this room and if you were ever
curious<00:00:38.160> enough<00:00:40.070> you<00:00:41.070> wouldn't<00:00:41.460> notice<00:00:41.700> a<00:00:42.180> lot

00:00:42.590 --> 00:00:42.600 
curious enough you wouldn't notice a lot

00:00:42.600 --> 00:00:47.350 
curious enough you wouldn't notice a lot
of<00:00:42.629> this<00:00:43.040> redstone<00:00:44.040> behind<00:00:44.550> the<00:00:44.640> scenes<00:00:44.940> and

00:00:47.350 --> 00:00:47.360 

00:00:47.360 --> 00:00:49.700 

there<00:00:48.360> are<00:00:48.480> a<00:00:48.510> few<00:00:48.690> problems<00:00:49.020> with<00:00:49.320> the<00:00:49.559> red

00:00:49.700 --> 00:00:49.710 
there are a few problems with the red

00:00:49.710 --> 00:00:52.450 
there are a few problems with the red
stone<00:00:49.950> as<00:00:50.219> of<00:00:50.520> one<00:00:50.730> point<00:00:50.910> six<00:00:51.120> point<00:00:51.420> two<00:00:51.449> and

00:00:52.450 --> 00:00:52.460 
stone as of one point six point two and

00:00:52.460 --> 00:00:56.209 
stone as of one point six point two and
the<00:00:53.460> biggest<00:00:53.940> problem<00:00:54.510> right<00:00:54.690> now<00:00:54.750> is<00:00:55.219> the

00:00:56.209 --> 00:00:56.219 
the biggest problem right now is the

00:00:56.219 --> 00:00:58.970 
the biggest problem right now is the
fact<00:00:56.399> that<00:00:56.640> the<00:00:57.449> glowstone<00:00:58.050> bud<00:00:58.379> switches

00:00:58.970 --> 00:00:58.980 
fact that the glowstone bud switches

00:00:58.980 --> 00:01:02.450 
fact that the glowstone bud switches
don't<00:00:59.579> work<00:00:59.789> anymore<00:01:00.500> so<00:01:01.500> over<00:01:01.770> here<00:01:02.070> you<00:01:02.100> can

00:01:02.450 --> 00:01:02.460 
don't work anymore so over here you can

00:01:02.460 --> 00:01:06.530 
don't work anymore so over here you can
see<00:01:02.730> that<00:01:02.969> his<00:01:03.559> design<00:01:04.760> relies<00:01:05.760> entirely<00:01:06.270> on

00:01:06.530 --> 00:01:06.540 
see that his design relies entirely on

00:01:06.540 --> 00:01:10.490 
see that his design relies entirely on
this<00:01:07.170> glowstone<00:01:07.920> lamp<00:01:08.490> bud<00:01:08.970> switch<00:01:09.260> but<00:01:10.260> it<00:01:10.380> no

00:01:10.490 --> 00:01:10.500 
this glowstone lamp bud switch but it no

00:01:10.500 --> 00:01:16.600 
this glowstone lamp bud switch but it no
longer<00:01:10.530> works<00:01:11.390> so<00:01:12.409> i'm<00:01:13.409> here<00:01:13.950> to<00:01:15.409> show<00:01:16.409> you

00:01:16.600 --> 00:01:16.610 
longer works so i'm here to show you

00:01:16.610 --> 00:01:20.179 
longer works so i'm here to show you

well actually just give you an updated
version<00:01:20.340> of<00:01:20.759> the<00:01:20.850> map<00:01:21.060> that<00:01:21.630> fixes<00:01:22.170> this<00:01:22.409> this

00:01:23.050 --> 00:01:23.060 
version of the map that fixes this this

00:01:23.060 --> 00:01:26.420 
version of the map that fixes this this
map<00:01:24.060> selection<00:01:24.689> so<00:01:25.439> right<00:01:25.619> now<00:01:25.650> what<00:01:26.009> happens

00:01:26.420 --> 00:01:26.430 
map selection so right now what happens

00:01:26.430 --> 00:01:33.590 
map selection so right now what happens
is<00:01:26.670> let's<00:01:27.659> go<00:01:27.810> back<00:01:29.900> you'll<00:01:31.759> you'll<00:01:32.759> see<00:01:33.060> that

00:01:33.590 --> 00:01:33.600 
is let's go back you'll you'll see that

is let's go back you'll you'll see that
you<00:01:34.020> can<00:01:34.049> select<00:01:34.500> players<00:01:34.920> correctly<00:01:35.549> by

00:01:35.960 --> 00:01:35.970 
you can select players correctly by

00:01:35.970 --> 00:01:38.569 
you can select players correctly by
stepping<00:01:36.329> on<00:01:36.509> pressure<00:01:36.780> pad<00:01:37.079> and<00:01:37.430> then<00:01:38.430> you

00:01:38.569 --> 00:01:38.579 
stepping on pressure pad and then you

00:01:38.579 --> 00:01:41.300 
stepping on pressure pad and then you
can<00:01:38.759> select<00:01:38.909> your<00:01:39.150> class<00:01:39.479> correctly<00:01:40.079> and<00:01:40.310> i

can select your class correctly and i
don't<00:01:41.490> know<00:01:41.549> if<00:01:41.640> this<00:01:41.939> is<00:01:42.150> for<00:01:42.299> other

00:01:42.469 --> 00:01:42.479 
don't know if this is for other

00:01:42.479 --> 00:01:44.780 
don't know if this is for other
computers<00:01:43.049> but<00:01:43.229> if<00:01:43.350> you<00:01:43.470> select<00:01:43.829> a<00:01:43.979> blaze<00:01:44.460> or

00:01:44.780 --> 00:01:44.790 
computers but if you select a blaze or

00:01:44.790 --> 00:01:48.170 
computers but if you select a blaze or
wither<00:01:45.950> you<00:01:46.950> do<00:01:47.070> not<00:01:47.189> get<00:01:47.399> your<00:01:47.520> bow<00:01:47.759> if<00:01:48.000> your

00:01:50.060 --> 00:01:50.070 
wizard and you do not get your blaze rod

00:01:50.070 --> 00:01:52.580 
wizard and you do not get your blaze rod
if<00:01:50.250> you're<00:01:50.399> a<00:01:50.430> blade<00:01:50.700> so<00:01:51.540> i<00:01:51.570> also<00:01:51.810> fix<00:01:52.170> that<00:01:52.409> in

00:01:52.580 --> 00:01:52.590 
if you're a blade so i also fix that in

00:01:52.590 --> 00:01:56.420 
if you're a blade so i also fix that in
new<00:01:52.890> version<00:01:53.310> and<00:01:54.770> then<00:01:55.770> you<00:01:55.920> get<00:01:56.040> teleported

00:01:56.420 --> 00:01:56.430 
new version and then you get teleported

00:01:56.430 --> 00:01:59.330 
new version and then you get teleported
to<00:01:56.909> the<00:01:57.000> map<00:01:57.270> selection<00:01:57.840> and<00:01:58.829> over<00:01:59.040> here

00:01:59.330 --> 00:01:59.340 
to the map selection and over here

00:01:59.340 --> 00:02:03.679 
to the map selection and over here
basically<00:02:00.119> what<00:02:00.299> it<00:02:00.329> does<00:02:00.450> is<00:02:02.329> the<00:02:03.329> red<00:02:03.479> stone

00:02:03.679 --> 00:02:03.689 
basically what it does is the red stone

00:02:03.689 --> 00:02:06.170 
basically what it does is the red stone
gets<00:02:04.020> through<00:02:04.380> its<00:02:05.189> supposed<00:02:05.549> to<00:02:05.670> power<00:02:05.880> this

00:02:06.170 --> 00:02:06.180 
gets through its supposed to power this

00:02:06.180 --> 00:02:10.430 
gets through its supposed to power this
piston<00:02:06.659> to<00:02:07.200> move<00:02:07.619> this<00:02:08.899> sandstone<00:02:09.899> over<00:02:10.289> to

00:02:10.430 --> 00:02:10.440 
piston to move this sandstone over to

00:02:10.440 --> 00:02:13.010 
piston to move this sandstone over to
the<00:02:10.530> other<00:02:10.649> side<00:02:10.950> to<00:02:11.550> select<00:02:11.879> the<00:02:12.000> map<00:02:12.180> so<00:02:12.840> when

the other side to select the map so when

00:02:13.020 --> 00:02:13.910 
the other side to select the map so when
this

00:02:13.910 --> 00:02:13.920 
this

00:02:13.920 --> 00:02:16.910

turns on when you respawn it'll power

00:02:16.920 --> 00:02:18.710 
turns on when you respawn it'll power
that<00:02:17.069> command<00:02:17.400> block<00:02:17.580> right<00:02:18.300> now<00:02:18.480> what

happened is you select the mat you go to

00:02:23.489 --> 00:02:25.640 
happened is you select the mat you go to
the<00:02:23.700> map<00:02:23.910> correctly<00:02:24.239> but<00:02:24.870> as<00:02:24.989> soon<00:02:25.140> as<00:02:25.260> you<00:02:25.410> die

you don't respawn back at the map which

00:02:28.560 --> 00:02:31.850 
you don't respawn back at the map which
is<00:02:28.739> a<00:02:28.770> big<00:02:29.010> problem<00:02:29.190> right<00:02:29.430> now<00:02:29.610> so<00:02:30.569> I<00:02:31.050> fixed

00:02:31.850 --> 00:02:31.860 
is a big problem right now so I fixed

00:02:31.860 --> 00:02:36.970 
is a big problem right now so I fixed
that<00:02:31.890> and<00:02:32.190> then<00:02:32.790> add<00:02:33.260> this<00:02:34.260> here<00:02:34.920> let<00:02:35.160> me<00:02:35.660> eat

00:02:36.970 --> 00:02:36.980 
that and then add this here let me eat

00:02:36.980 --> 00:02:44.710 
that and then add this here let me eat
one<00:02:37.980> pound<00:02:39.680> 7g<00:02:42.380> you<00:02:43.380> can<00:02:43.560> run<00:02:43.739> 15<00:02:44.190> or<00:02:44.400> something

00:02:44.710 --> 00:02:44.720 
one pound 7g you can run 15 or something

00:02:44.720 --> 00:02:48.320 
one pound 7g you can run 15 or something
right<00:02:45.720> here<00:02:45.930> so<00:02:46.500> as<00:02:46.830> you<00:02:47.550> can<00:02:47.640> see<00:02:47.850> there's<00:02:48.239> a

00:02:48.320 --> 00:02:48.330 
right here so as you can see there's a

00:02:48.330 --> 00:02:53.150 
right here so as you can see there's a
scoreboard<00:02:48.959> for<00:02:50.000> your<00:02:51.000> brawl<00:02:51.540> and<00:02:51.900> I<00:02:52.739> notice

00:02:53.150 --> 00:02:53.160 
scoreboard for your brawl and I notice

00:02:53.160 --> 00:02:55.509 
scoreboard for your brawl and I notice
that<00:02:53.459> the<00:02:53.670> scoreboard<00:02:54.180> no<00:02:54.390> longer<00:02:54.750> works<00:02:54.989> it

00:02:55.509 --> 00:02:55.519 
that the scoreboard no longer works it

00:02:55.519 --> 00:02:59.000 
that the scoreboard no longer works it
it<00:02:56.720> sometimes<00:02:57.720> gives<00:02:58.019> you<00:02:58.140> three<00:02:58.470> lies<00:02:58.680> only

00:02:59.000 --> 00:02:59.010 
it sometimes gives you three lies only

00:02:59.010 --> 00:03:02.840 
it sometimes gives you three lies only
or<00:02:59.370> four<00:03:00.000> lives<00:03:00.239> instead<00:03:00.690> of<00:03:00.870> five<00:03:01.310> so<00:03:02.310> I<00:03:02.340> also

00:03:02.840 --> 00:03:02.850 
or four lives instead of five so I also

00:03:02.850 --> 00:03:05.330 
or four lives instead of five so I also
fix<00:03:03.209> that<00:03:03.420> in<00:03:03.569> the<00:03:03.690> new<00:03:03.840> version<00:03:03.900> so<00:03:04.890> now<00:03:05.069> let's

00:03:05.330 --> 00:03:05.340 
fix that in the new version so now let's

00:03:05.340 --> 00:03:07.960 
fix that in the new version so now let's
get<00:03:05.730> over<00:03:05.760> to<00:03:06.030> the<00:03:06.239> new<00:03:06.750> version<00:03:06.930> with<00:03:07.410> the

00:03:07.960 --> 00:03:07.970 
get over to the new version with the

00:03:07.970 --> 00:03:13.070 
get over to the new version with the
fixed<00:03:08.970> component<00:03:11.120> so<00:03:12.120> let's<00:03:12.450> go<00:03:12.569> to<00:03:12.630> game<00:03:12.870> on

00:03:13.070 --> 00:03:13.080 
fixed component so let's go to game on

00:03:13.080 --> 00:03:19.729 
fixed component so let's go to game on
one<00:03:14.870> so<00:03:15.870> this<00:03:16.080> new<00:03:16.290> version<00:03:18.019> 6<00:03:19.019> is<00:03:19.170> quite<00:03:19.470> a<00:03:19.500> few

00:03:19.729 --> 00:03:19.739 
one so this new version 6 is quite a few

00:03:19.739 --> 00:03:24.020 
one so this new version 6 is quite a few
things<00:03:20.690> first<00:03:21.690> of<00:03:21.930> all<00:03:22.250> over<00:03:23.250> here<00:03:23.549> you<00:03:23.850> can

00:03:24.020 --> 00:03:24.030 
things first of all over here you can

00:03:24.030 --> 00:03:26.569 
things first of all over here you can
select<00:03:24.180> blaze<00:03:24.720> correctly<00:03:25.380> so<00:03:25.680> as<00:03:26.040> I'll<00:03:26.549> show

00:03:26.569 --> 00:03:26.579 
select blaze correctly so as I'll show

00:03:26.579 --> 00:03:29.810 
select blaze correctly so as I'll show
you<00:03:27.500> it'll<00:03:28.500> actually<00:03:28.620> give<00:03:28.950> me<00:03:29.130> a<00:03:29.160> blaze<00:03:29.489> rock

00:03:29.810 --> 00:03:29.820 
you it'll actually give me a blaze rock

00:03:29.820 --> 00:03:33.050 
you it'll actually give me a blaze rock
when<00:03:30.090> i<00:03:30.120> select<00:03:30.359> great<00:03:30.810> place<00:03:31.350> as<00:03:31.739> you<00:03:32.700> see<00:03:32.910> you

00:03:33.050 --> 00:03:33.060 
when i select great place as you see you

00:03:33.060 --> 00:03:36.020 
when i select great place as you see you
get<00:03:33.239> the<00:03:33.359> blades<00:03:33.570> rock<00:03:33.780> so<00:03:34.530> that's<00:03:35.459> one<00:03:35.850> thing

00:03:36.020 --> 00:03:36.030 
get the blades rock so that's one thing

00:03:36.030 --> 00:03:38.330 
get the blades rock so that's one thing
that<00:03:36.090> ticks<00:03:36.420> and<00:03:36.690> the<00:03:37.530> second<00:03:37.829> thing<00:03:37.859> I<00:03:38.040> fixed

00:03:38.330 --> 00:03:38.340 
that ticks and the second thing I fixed

00:03:38.340 --> 00:03:40.819 
that ticks and the second thing I fixed
is<00:03:38.489> a<00:03:38.519> map<00:03:38.850> selection<00:03:39.480> so<00:03:39.780> I<00:03:40.140> made<00:03:40.410> it<00:03:40.560> a<00:03:40.620> lot

00:03:40.819 --> 00:03:40.829 
is a map selection so I made it a lot

00:03:40.829 --> 00:03:44.150 
is a map selection so I made it a lot
more<00:03:41.060> complex<00:03:42.060> with<00:03:42.450> this<00:03:42.950> random<00:03:43.950> number

00:03:44.150 --> 00:03:44.160 
more complex with this random number

00:03:44.160 --> 00:03:47.210 
more complex with this random number
generator<00:03:44.790> for<00:03:45.690> the<00:03:45.810> random<00:03:46.170> map<00:03:46.410> selection

00:03:47.210 --> 00:03:47.220 
generator for the random map selection

00:03:47.220 --> 00:03:52.640 
generator for the random map selection
and<00:03:47.780> over<00:03:48.780> here<00:03:49.109> is<00:03:50.660> basically<00:03:51.660> i<00:03:52.109> replace<00:03:52.470> the

00:03:52.640 --> 00:03:52.650 
and over here is basically i replace the

00:03:52.650 --> 00:03:55.280 
and over here is basically i replace the
glowstone<00:03:53.160> bud<00:03:53.459> with<00:03:54.239> piston<00:03:54.660> buds<00:03:54.900> which

00:03:55.280 --> 00:03:55.290 
glowstone bud with piston buds which

00:03:55.290 --> 00:04:01.479 
glowstone bud with piston buds which
still<00:03:56.190> work<00:03:56.459> so<00:03:57.859> with<00:03:58.859> this<00:03:59.130> i'm<00:03:59.579> able<00:04:00.000> to

00:04:01.479 --> 00:04:01.489 
still work so with this i'm able to

00:04:01.489 --> 00:04:04.250 
still work so with this i'm able to
select<00:04:02.489> the<00:04:02.700> map<00:04:02.910> and<00:04:03.150> respawn<00:04:03.750> at<00:04:03.959> the<00:04:04.109> map

00:04:04.250 --> 00:04:04.260 
select the map and respawn at the map

00:04:04.260 --> 00:04:08.410 
select the map and respawn at the map
correctly<00:04:06.109> and<00:04:07.109> i'll<00:04:07.470> also<00:04:07.560> show<00:04:08.040> you<00:04:08.069> this

00:04:08.410 --> 00:04:08.420 
correctly and i'll also show you this

00:04:08.420 --> 00:04:11.750 
correctly and i'll also show you this
random<00:04:09.420> map<00:04:09.630> so<00:04:10.290> before<00:04:10.470> in<00:04:10.950> the<00:04:11.370> old<00:04:11.519> version

00:04:11.750 --> 00:04:11.760 
random map so before in the old version

00:04:11.760 --> 00:04:15.440 
random map so before in the old version
the<00:04:12.209> random<00:04:12.540> match<00:04:12.660> sponded<00:04:13.260> a<00:04:13.380> villager<00:04:13.980> on<00:04:14.450> a

00:04:15.440 --> 00:04:15.450 
the random match sponded a villager on a

00:04:15.450 --> 00:04:21.670 
the random match sponded a villager on a
pressure<00:04:15.780> pad<00:04:17.389> over<00:04:18.389> here<00:04:19.579> right<00:04:20.579> there<00:04:20.639> and

00:04:21.670 --> 00:04:21.680 
pressure pad over here right there and

00:04:21.680 --> 00:04:24.800 
pressure pad over here right there and
the<00:04:22.680> villager<00:04:23.099> doesn't<00:04:23.400> die<00:04:23.610> so<00:04:24.300> it<00:04:24.570> can<00:04:24.690> just

00:04:24.800 --> 00:04:24.810 
the villager doesn't die so it can just

00:04:24.810 --> 00:04:27.740 
the villager doesn't die so it can just
walk<00:04:25.200> around<00:04:25.409> and<00:04:25.919> step<00:04:26.640> on<00:04:26.760> other<00:04:26.789> pressure

00:04:27.740 --> 00:04:27.750 
walk around and step on other pressure

00:04:27.750 --> 00:04:31.400 
walk around and step on other pressure
path<00:04:28.010> so<00:04:29.010> in<00:04:29.130> this<00:04:29.220> version<00:04:29.460> I<00:04:30.410> completely

00:04:31.400 --> 00:04:31.410 
path so in this version I completely

00:04:31.410 --> 00:04:34.730 
path so in this version I completely
trash<00:04:31.860> the<00:04:32.160> villager<00:04:32.550> idea<00:04:32.850> and<00:04:33.090> I<00:04:34.020> decided<00:04:34.470> to

00:04:34.730 --> 00:04:34.740 
trash the villager idea and I decided to

00:04:34.740 --> 00:04:37.250 
trash the villager idea and I decided to
make<00:04:34.770> a<00:04:35.070> random<00:04:35.550> number<00:04:35.880> generator<00:04:36.360> that

00:04:37.250 --> 00:04:37.260 
make a random number generator that

00:04:37.260 --> 00:04:39.410 
make a random number generator that
generates<00:04:37.320> a<00:04:37.890> random<00:04:37.920> number<00:04:38.520> and<00:04:38.670> teleports

00:04:39.410 --> 00:04:39.420 
generates a random number and teleports

00:04:39.420 --> 00:04:43.190 
generates a random number and teleports
you<00:04:39.540> to<00:04:39.990> one<00:04:40.200> of<00:04:40.320> these<00:04:40.440> pressure<00:04:41.100> pad<00:04:42.140> so<00:04:43.140> I

00:04:43.190 --> 00:04:43.200 
you to one of these pressure pad so I

00:04:43.200 --> 00:04:47.330 
you to one of these pressure pad so I
can<00:04:43.560> show<00:04:43.770> you<00:04:43.830> that<00:04:44.010> in<00:04:44.220> action<00:04:45.920> now<00:04:46.920> I'm

00:04:47.330 --> 00:04:47.340 
can show you that in action now I'm

00:04:47.340 --> 00:04:49.460 
can show you that in action now I'm
actually<00:04:47.730> one<00:04:48.090> player<00:04:48.390> and<00:04:48.690> there's<00:04:48.990> only<00:04:49.140> six

00:04:49.460 --> 00:04:49.470 
actually one player and there's only six

00:04:49.470 --> 00:04:53.300 
actually one player and there's only six
maps<00:04:49.740> so<00:04:50.250> this<00:04:51.090> has<00:04:51.270> failed<00:04:51.630> to<00:04:52.160> select<00:04:53.160> the

00:04:53.300 --> 00:04:53.310 
maps so this has failed to select the

00:04:53.310 --> 00:04:56.030 
maps so this has failed to select the
map<00:04:53.490> just<00:04:54.420> remember<00:04:55.020> that<00:04:55.290> there's<00:04:55.560> only<00:04:55.770> six

00:04:56.030 --> 00:04:56.040 
map just remember that there's only six

00:04:56.040 --> 00:04:58.880 
map just remember that there's only six
maps<00:04:56.280> and<00:04:56.610> that's<00:04:57.600> a<00:04:57.690> 15<00:04:58.080> number<00:04:58.410> generator

00:04:58.880 --> 00:04:58.890 
maps and that's a 15 number generator

00:04:58.890 --> 00:05:02.540 
maps and that's a 15 number generator
and<00:04:59.270> also<00:05:00.270> if<00:05:00.660> I<00:05:00.990> do<00:05:01.050> get<00:05:01.740> selected<00:05:02.100> in<00:05:02.370> one<00:05:02.520> of

00:05:02.540 --> 00:05:02.550 
and also if I do get selected in one of

00:05:02.550 --> 00:05:04.520 
and also if I do get selected in one of
the<00:05:02.730> six<00:05:02.970> months<00:05:03.330> I'll<00:05:03.480> die<00:05:03.870> instantly

00:05:04.520 --> 00:05:04.530 
the six months I'll die instantly

00:05:04.530 --> 00:05:09.440

because<00:05:05.040> there's<00:05:05.550> no<00:05:05.730> other<00:05:05.850> player<00:05:08.390> so<00:05:09.390> it

00:05:09.440 --> 00:05:09.450 
because there's no other player so it

00:05:09.450 --> 00:05:12.620 
because there's no other player so it
says<00:05:09.630> Matt<00:05:09.870> 14<00:05:10.380> selected<00:05:10.980> and<00:05:11.190> it<00:05:12.090> says<00:05:12.270> that
