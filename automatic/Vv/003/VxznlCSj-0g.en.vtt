it's got these round holes and a kind of
rounded<00:00:24.369> edge<00:00:24.929> I<00:00:25.929> haven't<00:00:26.499> tried<00:00:26.710> this<00:00:26.949> yet<00:00:27.009> so

00:00:28.189 --> 00:00:28.199

a standard session steel this one's in B
natural<00:00:35.350> minor<00:00:35.739> tuning<00:00:36.039> I<00:00:36.449> don't<00:00:37.449> have<00:00:37.570> any

00:00:37.709 --> 00:00:37.719 
natural minor tuning I don't have any

natural minor tuning I don't have any
session<00:00:38.140> steals<00:00:38.410> in<00:00:38.680> stand<00:00:39.399> the<00:00:39.489> tunings<00:00:39.850> and

00:00:39.959 --> 00:00:39.969 
session steals in stand the tunings and

00:00:39.969 --> 00:00:41.759 
session steals in stand the tunings and
frayed<00:00:40.289> so<00:00:41.289> I'm<00:00:41.350> just<00:00:41.440> going<00:00:41.559> to<00:00:41.649> play<00:00:41.739> a

00:00:41.759 --> 00:00:41.769 
frayed so I'm just going to play a

00:00:41.769 --> 00:00:44.490 
frayed so I'm just going to play a
little<00:00:42.010> bit<00:00:42.100> on<00:00:42.219> this<00:00:42.460> and<00:00:42.789> then<00:00:43.469> switch<00:00:44.469> the

00:00:44.490 --> 00:00:44.500 
little bit on this and then switch the

00:00:44.500 --> 00:00:47.009 
little bit on this and then switch the
games<00:00:44.890> over<00:00:45.429> fast-forward<00:00:46.210> and<00:00:46.420> we'll<00:00:46.870> see

00:00:47.009 --> 00:00:47.019 
games over fast-forward and we'll see

00:00:47.019 --> 00:02:20.870 
games over fast-forward and we'll see
how<00:00:47.109> it<00:00:47.260> compares

00:02:20.870 --> 00:02:20.880 

00:02:20.880 --> 00:02:24.479 

okay<00:02:21.880> so<00:02:21.940> I've<00:02:22.209> changed<00:02:22.420> the<00:02:22.989> comb<00:02:23.250> the<00:02:24.250> first

00:02:24.479 --> 00:02:24.489 
okay so I've changed the comb the first

00:02:24.489 --> 00:02:27.259 
okay so I've changed the comb the first
thing<00:02:24.700> you<00:02:24.760> notice<00:02:24.910> is<00:02:25.090> it<00:02:25.510> looks<00:02:25.840> really<00:02:26.620> cool

00:02:27.259 --> 00:02:27.269 
thing you notice is it looks really cool

00:02:27.269 --> 00:02:30.360 
thing you notice is it looks really cool
the<00:02:28.269> kind<00:02:28.510> of<00:02:28.540> shiny<00:02:28.870> bread<00:02:29.370> aluminium

00:02:30.360 --> 00:02:30.370 
the kind of shiny bread aluminium

00:02:30.370 --> 00:02:33.830 
the kind of shiny bread aluminium
against<00:02:31.030> the<00:02:31.239> stainless<00:02:31.660> steel<00:02:31.690> is<00:02:32.230> a<00:02:32.980> nice

00:02:33.830 --> 00:02:33.840 
against the stainless steel is a nice

00:02:33.840 --> 00:02:38.580 
against the stainless steel is a nice
combination<00:02:34.840> I<00:02:35.970> think<00:02:36.970> it<00:02:37.109> looks<00:02:38.109> better<00:02:38.350> than

00:02:38.580 --> 00:02:38.590 
combination I think it looks better than

00:02:38.590 --> 00:02:45.210 
combination I think it looks better than
the<00:02:38.829> in<00:02:39.609> the<00:02:39.760> original<00:02:41.790> um<00:02:43.769> as<00:02:44.769> far<00:02:44.980> as<00:02:45.100> the

00:02:45.210 --> 00:02:45.220 
the in the original um as far as the

00:02:45.220 --> 00:02:50.090 
the in the original um as far as the
sound<00:02:45.430> goes<00:02:45.780> not<00:02:46.780> a<00:02:46.810> dramatic<00:02:47.230> difference<00:02:48.359> I

00:02:50.090 --> 00:02:50.100 
sound goes not a dramatic difference I

00:02:50.100 --> 00:02:53.210 
sound goes not a dramatic difference I
think<00:02:51.100> it's<00:02:51.549> perhaps<00:02:51.760> a<00:02:52.000> little<00:02:52.030> bit<00:02:52.390> louder

00:02:53.210 --> 00:02:53.220 
think it's perhaps a little bit louder

00:02:53.220 --> 00:02:57.870 
think it's perhaps a little bit louder
maybe<00:02:54.220> a<00:02:54.340> slightly<00:02:54.940> brighter<00:02:55.980> tone<00:02:56.980> which<00:02:57.700> I

00:02:57.870 --> 00:02:57.880 
maybe a slightly brighter tone which I

00:02:57.880 --> 00:03:00.210 
maybe a slightly brighter tone which I
like<00:02:58.230> but<00:02:59.230> you<00:02:59.380> can<00:02:59.530> hear<00:02:59.709> from<00:02:59.920> the<00:03:00.010> video

00:03:00.210 --> 00:03:00.220 
like but you can hear from the video

00:03:00.220 --> 00:03:02.670 
like but you can hear from the video
it's<00:03:00.400> not<00:03:00.579> not<00:03:01.000> a<00:03:01.030> massive<00:03:01.530> difference<00:03:02.530> in

00:03:02.670 --> 00:03:02.680 
it's not not a massive difference in

00:03:02.680 --> 00:03:07.620 
it's not not a massive difference in
sound<00:03:04.859> the<00:03:05.859> other<00:03:06.010> differences<00:03:06.519> I<00:03:06.699> noticed

00:03:07.620 --> 00:03:07.630 
sound the other differences I noticed

00:03:07.630 --> 00:03:10.950 
sound the other differences I noticed
um<00:03:07.860> it<00:03:08.860> this<00:03:09.820> is<00:03:09.970> obviously<00:03:10.240> a<00:03:10.300> bit<00:03:10.510> heavier

00:03:10.950 --> 00:03:10.960 
um it this is obviously a bit heavier

00:03:10.960 --> 00:03:13.350 
um it this is obviously a bit heavier
than<00:03:11.160> plastic<00:03:12.160> comb<00:03:12.550> which<00:03:12.760> way<00:03:12.940> is<00:03:13.000> more<00:03:13.270> or

00:03:13.350 --> 00:03:13.360 
than plastic comb which way is more or

00:03:13.360 --> 00:03:15.840 
than plastic comb which way is more or
less<00:03:13.390> nothing<00:03:14.100> it's<00:03:15.100> not<00:03:15.220> like<00:03:15.370> really<00:03:15.580> heavy

00:03:15.840 --> 00:03:15.850 
less nothing it's not like really heavy

00:03:15.850 --> 00:03:17.910 
less nothing it's not like really heavy
but<00:03:16.180> it<00:03:16.750> gives<00:03:16.960> it<00:03:17.050> a<00:03:17.140> little<00:03:17.260> bit<00:03:17.410> more<00:03:17.680> weight

00:03:17.910 --> 00:03:17.920 
but it gives it a little bit more weight

00:03:17.920 --> 00:03:21.720 
but it gives it a little bit more weight
which<00:03:18.640> are<00:03:18.820> quite<00:03:18.970> like<00:03:20.160> just<00:03:21.160> makes<00:03:21.340> it<00:03:21.490> feel

00:03:21.720 --> 00:03:21.730 
which are quite like just makes it feel

00:03:21.730 --> 00:03:24.000 
which are quite like just makes it feel
kind<00:03:22.030> of<00:03:22.060> more<00:03:22.210> solid<00:03:22.630> and<00:03:22.830> bit<00:03:23.830> more

00:03:24.000 --> 00:03:24.010 
kind of more solid and bit more

00:03:24.010 --> 00:03:30.090 
kind of more solid and bit more
expensive<00:03:24.540> which<00:03:25.540> is<00:03:25.570> always<00:03:25.930> nice<00:03:26.230> um<00:03:29.100> got

00:03:30.090 --> 00:03:30.100 
expensive which is always nice um got

00:03:30.100 --> 00:03:32.760 
expensive which is always nice um got
these<00:03:30.190> round<00:03:30.550> holes<00:03:31.450> as<00:03:32.080> opposed<00:03:32.440> to<00:03:32.590> the

00:03:32.760 --> 00:03:32.770 
these round holes as opposed to the

00:03:32.770 --> 00:03:41.160 
these round holes as opposed to the
standard<00:03:33.570> square<00:03:34.570> holes<00:03:37.440> doesn't<00:03:39.900> I've<00:03:40.900> never

00:03:41.160 --> 00:03:41.170 
standard square holes doesn't I've never

00:03:41.170 --> 00:03:42.120 
standard square holes doesn't I've never
really<00:03:41.440> been<00:03:41.530> able<00:03:41.680> to<00:03:41.800> tell<00:03:41.950> much<00:03:42.070> difference

00:03:42.120 --> 00:03:42.130 
really been able to tell much difference

00:03:42.130 --> 00:03:45.300 
really been able to tell much difference
between<00:03:42.910> round<00:03:43.210> or<00:03:43.420> square<00:03:44.050> maybe<00:03:44.980> you<00:03:45.130> have<00:03:45.280> a

00:03:45.300 --> 00:03:45.310 
between round or square maybe you have a

00:03:45.310 --> 00:03:47.820 
between round or square maybe you have a
preference<00:03:45.580> but<00:03:46.060> I<00:03:46.330> can't<00:03:47.110> really<00:03:47.380> tell<00:03:47.620> any

00:03:47.820 --> 00:03:47.830 
preference but I can't really tell any

00:03:47.830 --> 00:03:51.170 
preference but I can't really tell any
difference<00:03:48.250> when<00:03:48.460> I'm<00:03:48.550> playing<00:03:48.730> it

00:03:51.170 --> 00:03:51.180 

00:03:51.180 --> 00:03:55.740 

the<00:03:52.180> main<00:03:52.420> difference<00:03:52.900> in<00:03:53.110> feel<00:03:53.470> is<00:03:53.800> that<00:03:54.750> the

00:03:55.740 --> 00:03:55.750 
the main difference in feel is that the

00:03:55.750 --> 00:03:59.970 
the main difference in feel is that the
original<00:03:57.180> sessions<00:03:58.180> have<00:03:58.960> a<00:03:58.990> completely<00:03:59.740> flat

00:03:59.970 --> 00:03:59.980 
original sessions have a completely flat

00:03:59.980 --> 00:04:05.040 
original sessions have a completely flat
playing<00:04:00.940> surface<00:04:01.510> and<00:04:02.500> this<00:04:03.220> is<00:04:03.280> a<00:04:04.050> slightly

00:04:05.040 --> 00:04:05.050 
playing surface and this is a slightly

00:04:05.050 --> 00:04:10.350 
playing surface and this is a slightly
rounded<00:04:05.980> edge<00:04:08.100> I'll<00:04:09.100> actually<00:04:09.370> like<00:04:09.910> that<00:04:10.150> it

00:04:10.350 --> 00:04:10.360 
rounded edge I'll actually like that it

00:04:10.360 --> 00:04:16.200 
rounded edge I'll actually like that it
gives<00:04:10.660> it<00:04:10.870> more<00:04:13.020> feels<00:04:14.020> like<00:04:14.940> you've<00:04:15.940> got<00:04:16.180> a

00:04:16.200 --> 00:04:16.210 
gives it more feels like you've got a

00:04:49.350 --> 00:04:49.360 
um so yeah I like this I would recommend

00:04:49.360 --> 00:04:53.460 
um so yeah I like this I would recommend
it<00:04:51.420> the<00:04:52.420> main<00:04:52.600> thing<00:04:52.840> is<00:04:52.960> it<00:04:53.110> just<00:04:53.320> looks

00:04:53.460 --> 00:04:53.470 
it the main thing is it just looks

00:04:53.470 --> 00:04:56.070 
it the main thing is it just looks
really<00:04:53.770> cool<00:04:53.980> and<00:04:54.730> it<00:04:55.570> gives<00:04:55.720> it<00:04:55.870> that<00:04:55.930> extra

00:04:56.070 --> 00:04:56.080 
really cool and it gives it that extra

00:04:56.080 --> 00:05:00.030 
really cool and it gives it that extra
bit<00:04:56.440> of<00:04:56.590> weight<00:04:56.770> makes<00:04:57.760> it<00:04:57.880> feel<00:04:58.030> nice<00:04:59.040> and

00:05:00.030 --> 00:05:00.040 
bit of weight makes it feel nice and

00:05:00.040 --> 00:05:02.340 
bit of weight makes it feel nice and
like<00:05:00.190> I<00:05:00.250> said<00:05:00.430> it<00:05:00.700> does<00:05:01.330> make<00:05:01.510> a<00:05:01.540> very<00:05:01.840> slight

00:05:02.340 --> 00:05:02.350 
like I said it does make a very slight

00:05:02.350 --> 00:05:05.250 
like I said it does make a very slight
difference<00:05:02.650> to<00:05:03.370> the<00:05:03.490> sound<00:05:03.790> but<00:05:04.210> don't<00:05:04.900> expect

00:05:05.250 --> 00:05:05.260 
difference to the sound but don't expect

00:05:05.260 --> 00:05:09.420 
difference to the sound but don't expect
