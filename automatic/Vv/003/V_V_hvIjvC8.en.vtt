all<00:00:01.740> right<00:00:01.920> so<00:00:02.190> this<00:00:02.280> is<00:00:02.460> a<00:00:02.490> crude<00:00:03.000> servo<00:00:03.720> made

00:00:04.039 --> 00:00:04.049 
all right so this is a crude servo made

00:00:04.049 --> 00:00:08.780 
all right so this is a crude servo made
out<00:00:04.200> of<00:00:04.319> a<00:00:04.410> bandbox<00:00:05.299> p60<00:00:06.299> gearbox<00:00:06.839> a<00:00:07.790> that's

00:00:08.780 --> 00:00:08.790 
out of a bandbox p60 gearbox a that's

00:00:08.790 --> 00:00:14.419 
out of a bandbox p60 gearbox a that's
the<00:00:08.910> gearbox<00:00:09.469> over<00:00:10.469> here<00:00:10.710> a<00:00:12.679> mad<00:00:13.679> scientist

00:00:14.419 --> 00:00:14.429 
the gearbox over here a mad scientist

the gearbox over here a mad scientist
Hut<00:00:14.929> magnetic<00:00:15.929> rotary<00:00:16.289> encoder<00:00:16.710> board<00:00:17.039> it's

00:00:17.689 --> 00:00:17.699 
Hut magnetic rotary encoder board it's

00:00:17.699 --> 00:00:20.420 
Hut magnetic rotary encoder board it's
like<00:00:17.820> a<00:00:17.850> breakout<00:00:18.300> board<00:00:18.570> it's<00:00:18.810> got<00:00:18.990> a<00:00:19.250> chip<00:00:20.250> on

00:00:20.420 --> 00:00:20.430 
like a breakout board it's got a chip on

00:00:20.430 --> 00:00:22.880 
like a breakout board it's got a chip on
the<00:00:20.520> other<00:00:20.640> side<00:00:20.970> in<00:00:21.330> that<00:00:21.630> hole<00:00:21.840> that<00:00:22.650> reads

00:00:22.880 --> 00:00:22.890 
the other side in that hole that reads

00:00:22.890 --> 00:00:26.210 
the other side in that hole that reads
the<00:00:23.070> output<00:00:23.519> of<00:00:23.670> this<00:00:24.029> shaft<00:00:24.390> here<00:00:25.220> via

00:00:26.210 --> 00:00:26.220 
the output of this shaft here via

00:00:26.220 --> 00:00:30.650 
the output of this shaft here via
magnetism<00:00:26.820> and<00:00:27.260> then<00:00:28.260> here<00:00:28.740> we've<00:00:29.160> got<00:00:29.429> a<00:00:29.880> pole

00:00:30.650 --> 00:00:30.660 
magnetism and then here we've got a pole

00:00:30.660 --> 00:00:32.240 
magnetism and then here we've got a pole
all<00:00:30.929> ooh<00:00:31.170> I<00:00:31.529> don't<00:00:31.830> know<00:00:31.920> how<00:00:32.040> you<00:00:32.099> pronounce

00:00:32.240 --> 00:00:32.250 
all ooh I don't know how you pronounce

00:00:32.250 --> 00:00:36.880 
all ooh I don't know how you pronounce
that<00:00:33.860> md0

00:00:36.880 --> 00:00:36.890 

00:00:36.890 --> 00:00:42.639 

1b<00:00:38.180> that's<00:00:39.180> basically<00:00:39.600> a<00:00:40.050> 30<00:00:40.950> amp<00:00:41.219> I<00:00:41.579> believe

00:00:42.639 --> 00:00:42.649 
1b that's basically a 30 amp I believe

00:00:42.649 --> 00:00:47.330 
1b that's basically a 30 amp I believe
motor<00:00:43.649> control<00:00:44.280> board<00:00:44.579> and<00:00:45.530> over<00:00:46.530> here<00:00:46.860> we've

00:00:47.330 --> 00:00:47.340 
motor control board and over here we've

00:00:47.340 --> 00:00:50.180 
motor control board and over here we've
got<00:00:47.610> an<00:00:48.059> arduino<00:00:48.809> nano<00:00:48.840> and<00:00:49.410> that's<00:00:50.039> the

00:00:50.180 --> 00:00:50.190 
got an arduino nano and that's the

00:00:50.190 --> 00:00:53.590 
got an arduino nano and that's the
brains<00:00:50.460> of<00:00:50.670> the<00:00:50.760> whole<00:00:50.789> thing<00:00:51.210> so<00:00:52.250> basically

00:00:53.590 --> 00:00:53.600 
brains of the whole thing so basically

00:00:53.600 --> 00:00:57.439 
brains of the whole thing so basically
on<00:00:54.600> my<00:00:54.809> computer<00:00:55.230> screen<00:00:55.530> here<00:00:55.860> I<00:00:56.039> can<00:00:56.730> set<00:00:57.059> the

00:00:57.439 --> 00:00:57.449 
on my computer screen here I can set the

00:00:57.449 --> 00:01:00.380 
on my computer screen here I can set the
position<00:00:58.320> so<00:00:59.250> let's<00:00:59.280> I<00:00:59.789> think<00:01:00.000> it's<00:01:00.149> set<00:01:00.359> to

00:01:00.380 --> 00:01:00.390 
position so let's I think it's set to

00:01:00.390 --> 00:01:02.569 
position so let's I think it's set to
120<00:01:01.230> degrees<00:01:01.530> right<00:01:01.920> now

00:01:02.569 --> 00:01:02.579 
120 degrees right now

00:01:02.579 --> 00:01:05.990 
120 degrees right now
let's<00:01:03.149> set<00:01:03.420> it<00:01:03.449> to<00:01:03.809> 60<00:01:04.769> I'm<00:01:05.640> just<00:01:05.820> going<00:01:05.939> to

00:01:05.990 --> 00:01:06.000 
let's set it to 60 I'm just going to

00:01:06.000 --> 00:01:07.880 
let's set it to 60 I'm just going to
type<00:01:06.180> in<00:01:06.360> 60<00:01:06.810> and<00:01:06.990> when<00:01:07.080> I<00:01:07.110> hit<00:01:07.320> enter<00:01:07.530> over

00:01:07.880 --> 00:01:07.890 
type in 60 and when I hit enter over

00:01:07.890 --> 00:01:10.370 
type in 60 and when I hit enter over
here<00:01:08.100> we<00:01:09.030> should<00:01:09.210> be<00:01:09.299> able<00:01:09.390> to<00:01:09.540> see<00:01:09.750> the<00:01:10.020> output

00:01:10.370 --> 00:01:10.380 
here we should be able to see the output

00:01:10.380 --> 00:01:13.670 
here we should be able to see the output
shaft<00:01:10.970> look<00:01:11.970> at<00:01:12.090> this<00:01:12.240> this<00:01:12.840> little<00:01:13.080> this

00:01:13.670 --> 00:01:13.680 
shaft look at this this little this

00:01:13.680 --> 00:01:15.560 
shaft look at this this little this
little<00:01:13.740> line<00:01:14.189> right<00:01:14.220> there<00:01:14.790> should<00:01:15.390> be<00:01:15.509> able

00:01:15.560 --> 00:01:15.570 
little line right there should be able

00:01:15.570 --> 00:01:18.469 
little line right there should be able
to<00:01:15.659> see<00:01:15.810> that<00:01:15.960> output<00:01:16.170> shaft<00:01:16.680> rotate<00:01:17.280> to<00:01:17.580> 60

00:01:18.469 --> 00:01:18.479 
to see that output shaft rotate to 60

00:01:18.479 --> 00:01:23.510 
to see that output shaft rotate to 60
degrees<00:01:20.390> there<00:01:21.390> it<00:01:21.509> is<00:01:21.659> so<00:01:22.590> this<00:01:22.740> is<00:01:22.890> not<00:01:23.100> using

00:01:23.510 --> 00:01:23.520 
degrees there it is so this is not using

00:01:23.520 --> 00:01:25.550 
degrees there it is so this is not using
a<00:01:23.580> PID<00:01:23.790> controller<00:01:24.090> right<00:01:24.810> now<00:01:24.990> I<00:01:25.020> think<00:01:25.259> this

00:01:25.550 --> 00:01:25.560 
a PID controller right now I think this

00:01:25.560 --> 00:01:28.700 
a PID controller right now I think this
is<00:01:25.619> using<00:01:26.159> some<00:01:26.909> custom<00:01:27.509> code<00:01:27.540> that<00:01:28.259> I<00:01:28.290> kind<00:01:28.590> of

00:01:28.700 --> 00:01:28.710 
is using some custom code that I kind of

00:01:28.710 --> 00:01:30.080 
is using some custom code that I kind of
hacked<00:01:28.920> together<00:01:29.130> so<00:01:29.610> it's<00:01:29.729> not<00:01:29.850> very

00:01:30.080 --> 00:01:30.090 
hacked together so it's not very

00:01:30.090 --> 00:01:32.780 
hacked together so it's not very
accurate<00:01:30.270> but<00:01:30.570> as<00:01:31.049> soon<00:01:31.409> as<00:01:31.500> I<00:01:31.610> update<00:01:32.610> this

00:01:32.780 --> 00:01:32.790 
accurate but as soon as I update this

00:01:32.790 --> 00:01:35.600 
accurate but as soon as I update this
with<00:01:33.060> some<00:01:33.840> PID<00:01:34.170> code<00:01:34.590> I<00:01:34.619> think<00:01:34.920> this<00:01:35.280> will<00:01:35.400> be

00:01:35.600 --> 00:01:35.610 
with some PID code I think this will be

00:01:35.610 --> 00:01:38.390 
with some PID code I think this will be
quite<00:01:36.600> a<00:01:36.630> bit<00:01:36.810> nicer

00:01:38.390 --> 00:01:38.400 
quite a bit nicer

00:01:38.400 --> 00:01:46.190 
quite a bit nicer
let's<00:01:39.240> go<00:01:39.360> 220<00:01:40.320> degrees<00:01:41.540> and<00:01:43.399> go<00:01:44.399> to<00:01:45.200> 180

00:01:46.190 --> 00:01:46.200 
let's go 220 degrees and go to 180

00:01:46.200 --> 00:01:47.929 
let's go 220 degrees and go to 180
degrees<00:01:46.560> this<00:01:47.189> will<00:01:47.340> be<00:01:47.430> a<00:01:47.460> little<00:01:47.579> bit<00:01:47.729> past

00:01:47.929 --> 00:01:47.939 
degrees this will be a little bit past

00:01:47.939 --> 00:01:50.280 
degrees this will be a little bit past
where<00:01:48.240> we<00:01:48.329> started

00:01:50.280 --> 00:01:50.290 
where we started

00:01:50.290 --> 00:01:55.100 
where we started
there<00:01:51.250> we<00:01:51.370> go<00:01:51.460> and<00:01:51.730> then<00:01:51.850> back<00:01:52.030> to<00:01:52.330> 120<00:01:53.260> degrees

00:01:55.100 --> 00:01:55.110 
there we go and then back to 120 degrees

00:01:55.110 --> 00:01:58.860 
there we go and then back to 120 degrees
there<00:01:56.110> we<00:01:56.200> go<00:01:56.320> so<00:01:57.210> it<00:01:58.210> should<00:01:58.480> be<00:01:58.510> fairly

00:01:58.860 --> 00:01:58.870 
there we go so it should be fairly

00:01:58.870 --> 00:02:01.020 
there we go so it should be fairly
accurate<00:01:59.010> that's<00:02:00.010> an<00:02:00.160> absolute<00:02:00.580> position

00:02:01.020 --> 00:02:01.030 
accurate that's an absolute position

00:02:01.030 --> 00:02:04.020 
accurate that's an absolute position
sensor<00:02:01.840> and<00:02:02.200> it's<00:02:02.650> on<00:02:02.830> again<00:02:03.340> it's<00:02:03.730> reading

00:02:04.020 --> 00:02:04.030 
sensor and it's on again it's reading

00:02:04.030 --> 00:02:06.740 
sensor and it's on again it's reading
the<00:02:04.150> output<00:02:04.600> shaft<00:02:05.130> orientation<00:02:06.130> in<00:02:06.340> degrees

00:02:06.740 --> 00:02:06.750 
the output shaft orientation in degrees

00:02:06.750 --> 00:02:09.330 
the output shaft orientation in degrees
using<00:02:07.750> a<00:02:07.840> magnet<00:02:08.229> that's<00:02:08.619> affixed<00:02:09.130> to<00:02:09.160> the
