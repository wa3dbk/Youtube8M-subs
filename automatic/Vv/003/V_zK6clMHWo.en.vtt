on<00:00:18.510> the<00:00:20.029> galaxy<00:00:21.029> s2<00:00:21.600> I<00:00:23.000> believe<00:00:24.000> it's<00:00:24.150> 4.5<00:00:24.750> and

00:00:25.009 --> 00:00:25.019 
on the galaxy s2 I believe it's 4.5 and

00:00:25.019 --> 00:00:26.740 
on the galaxy s2 I believe it's 4.5 and
I'm<00:00:25.470> not<00:00:25.619> sure<00:00:25.769> is<00:00:25.949> that<00:00:26.099> four<00:00:26.250> point<00:00:26.460> three<00:00:26.490> or

00:00:26.740 --> 00:00:26.750 
I'm not sure is that four point three or

00:00:26.750 --> 00:00:30.859 
I'm not sure is that four point three or
four<00:00:27.750> point<00:00:27.990> five<00:00:28.429> but<00:00:29.429> you<00:00:29.519> can<00:00:29.670> sit<00:00:29.880> so<00:00:30.330> thin

00:00:30.859 --> 00:00:30.869 
four point five but you can sit so thin

00:00:30.869 --> 00:00:33.560 
four point five but you can sit so thin
um<00:00:31.489> look<00:00:32.489> at<00:00:32.610> that<00:00:32.759> the<00:00:32.940> design<00:00:33.300> is<00:00:33.329> actually

00:00:33.560 --> 00:00:33.570 
um look at that the design is actually

00:00:33.570 --> 00:00:35.870 
um look at that the design is actually
very<00:00:33.840> similar<00:00:34.410> because<00:00:35.250> they're<00:00:35.399> both<00:00:35.610> made

00:00:35.870 --> 00:00:35.880 
very similar because they're both made

00:00:35.880 --> 00:00:39.940 
very similar because they're both made
by<00:00:36.030> samsung<00:00:36.380> um<00:00:37.969> actually<00:00:38.969> you<00:00:39.270> know<00:00:39.360> what
