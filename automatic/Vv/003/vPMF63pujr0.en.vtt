would<00:02:16.780> go<00:02:16.930> and<00:02:17.170> you<00:02:17.290> get<00:02:17.440> upgraded<00:02:17.800> to<00:02:17.920> up<00:02:18.100> to

00:02:18.630 --> 00:02:18.640 
would go and you get upgraded to up to

00:02:18.640 --> 00:02:22.949 
would go and you get upgraded to up to
32<00:02:20.100> gigabytes<00:02:21.120> you<00:02:22.120> can<00:02:22.240> see<00:02:22.450> here<00:02:22.750> this<00:02:22.900> is

00:02:22.949 --> 00:02:22.959 
32 gigabytes you can see here this is

00:02:22.959 --> 00:02:26.460 
32 gigabytes you can see here this is
where<00:02:23.410> the<00:02:24.130> rear<00:02:24.490> facing<00:02:24.880> 5<00:02:25.390> megapixel<00:02:26.140> camera

00:02:26.460 --> 00:02:26.470 
where the rear facing 5 megapixel camera

00:02:26.470 --> 00:02:29.610 
where the rear facing 5 megapixel camera
is<00:02:26.650> so<00:02:27.640> it<00:02:27.790> shoots<00:02:28.000> both<00:02:28.300> in<00:02:28.570> video<00:02:29.290> and

00:02:29.610 --> 00:02:29.620 
is so it shoots both in video and

00:02:29.620 --> 00:02:32.640 
is so it shoots both in video and
pictures<00:02:30.130> and<00:02:30.600> the<00:02:31.600> front<00:02:31.870> face<00:02:32.080> in<00:02:32.320> one<00:02:32.470> is

00:02:32.640 --> 00:02:32.650 
pictures and the front face in one is

00:02:32.650 --> 00:02:37.840 
pictures and the front face in one is
simply<00:02:33.100> a<00:02:33.130> 2<00:02:33.489> megapixels

00:02:37.840 --> 00:02:37.850 

00:02:37.850 --> 00:02:39.970 

it<00:02:38.450> does<00:02:38.750> say<00:02:39.020> that<00:02:39.230> it<00:02:39.350> will<00:02:39.560> be<00:02:39.710> running

00:02:39.970 --> 00:02:39.980 
it does say that it will be running

00:02:39.980 --> 00:02:42.580 
it does say that it will be running
honeycomb<00:02:40.580> but<00:02:40.790> of<00:02:40.880> course<00:02:41.150> again<00:02:41.540> this<00:02:41.780> is<00:02:42.050> a

00:02:42.580 --> 00:02:42.590 
honeycomb but of course again this is a

00:02:42.590 --> 00:02:44.770 
honeycomb but of course again this is a
different<00:02:43.340> version<00:02:43.490> of<00:02:43.700> Android<00:02:44.210> and<00:02:44.570> let's

00:02:44.770 --> 00:02:44.780 
different version of Android and let's

00:02:44.780 --> 00:02:48.310 
different version of Android and let's
throw<00:02:45.320> up<00:02:45.500> the<00:02:46.430> proverbial<00:02:46.640> settings<00:02:47.600> and<00:02:48.050> you

00:02:48.310 --> 00:02:48.320 
throw up the proverbial settings and you

00:02:48.320 --> 00:02:51.370 
throw up the proverbial settings and you
guys<00:02:48.470> can<00:02:48.800> verify<00:02:49.280> this<00:02:49.340> for<00:02:49.760> yourselves<00:02:50.380> it

00:02:51.370 --> 00:02:51.380 
guys can verify this for yourselves it

00:02:51.380 --> 00:02:56.760 
guys can verify this for yourselves it
was<00:02:51.530> only<00:02:51.740> running<00:02:51.890> 2.2

00:02:56.760 --> 00:02:56.770 

00:02:56.770 --> 00:02:59.430 

so<00:02:57.400> I<00:02:57.430> no<00:02:57.730> idea<00:02:58.180> if<00:02:58.510> this<00:02:58.690> is<00:02:58.750> just<00:02:59.110> literally

00:02:59.430 --> 00:02:59.440 
so I no idea if this is just literally

00:02:59.440 --> 00:03:18.380 
so I no idea if this is just literally
build<00:02:59.890> or<00:03:00.250> what's<00:03:00.670> going<00:03:01.030> on

00:03:18.380 --> 00:03:18.390 

00:03:18.390 --> 00:03:29.070 

so<00:03:19.020> it<00:03:19.080> looks<00:03:19.110> like<00:03:19.319> only<00:03:19.530> eight<00:03:19.800> gigs

00:03:29.070 --> 00:03:29.080 

00:03:29.080 --> 00:03:31.290 

okay<00:03:29.770> so<00:03:29.830> let's<00:03:30.430> take<00:03:30.580> a<00:03:30.610> look<00:03:30.850> at<00:03:30.910> some<00:03:31.090> of<00:03:31.150> the

00:03:31.290 --> 00:03:31.300 
okay so let's take a look at some of the

00:03:31.300 --> 00:03:34.350 
okay so let's take a look at some of the
things<00:03:31.540> here<00:03:32.310> one<00:03:33.310> of<00:03:33.430> the<00:03:33.520> things<00:03:33.730> about<00:03:34.120> died

00:03:34.350 --> 00:03:34.360 
things here one of the things about died

00:03:34.360 --> 00:03:36.270 
things here one of the things about died
the<00:03:34.390> acer<00:03:34.990> tablets<00:03:35.500> that<00:03:35.650> we've<00:03:35.800> seen<00:03:36.040> so<00:03:36.250> far

00:03:36.270 --> 00:03:36.280 
the acer tablets that we've seen so far

00:03:36.280 --> 00:03:41.309 
the acer tablets that we've seen so far
is<00:03:36.760> that<00:03:36.820> they<00:03:37.300> have<00:03:37.510> these<00:03:37.750> little<00:03:37.810> sort<00:03:38.440> of

00:03:41.309 --> 00:03:41.319 

00:03:41.319 --> 00:03:43.530 

they<00:03:41.859> have<00:03:42.010> these<00:03:42.129> little<00:03:42.219> screens<00:03:42.879> here<00:03:43.209> set

00:03:43.530 --> 00:03:43.540 
they have these little screens here set

00:03:43.540 --> 00:03:46.770 
they have these little screens here set
up<00:03:43.739> so<00:03:44.739> they<00:03:44.859> have<00:03:45.010> an<00:03:45.129> e-reader<00:03:45.489> like<00:03:46.389> a<00:03:46.420> game

00:03:46.770 --> 00:03:46.780 
up so they have an e-reader like a game

00:03:46.780 --> 00:03:50.369 
up so they have an e-reader like a game
zone<00:03:48.389> multimedia<00:03:49.389> and<00:03:49.540> so<00:03:49.780> on<00:03:49.959> so<00:03:50.170> this<00:03:50.230> is

00:03:50.369 --> 00:03:50.379 
zone multimedia and so on so this is

00:03:50.379 --> 00:03:52.039 
zone multimedia and so on so this is
kind<00:03:50.590> of<00:03:50.620> a<00:03:50.709> neat<00:03:50.950> way<00:03:51.159> that<00:03:51.519> acer<00:03:51.969> is

00:03:52.039 --> 00:03:52.049 
kind of a neat way that acer is

00:03:52.049 --> 00:03:54.539 
kind of a neat way that acer is
organizing<00:03:53.049> things<00:03:53.230> so<00:03:53.799> you<00:03:53.889> can<00:03:54.040> see<00:03:54.219> here

00:03:54.539 --> 00:03:54.549 
organizing things so you can see here

00:03:54.549 --> 00:03:56.399 
organizing things so you can see here
that<00:03:54.579> they<00:03:54.879> do<00:03:54.939> have<00:03:55.299> a<00:03:55.329> the<00:03:55.629> luma<00:03:55.959> reader<00:03:56.170> and

00:03:56.399 --> 00:03:56.409 
that they do have a the luma reader and

00:03:56.409 --> 00:03:58.379 
that they do have a the luma reader and
this<00:03:56.530> is<00:03:56.680> sort<00:03:56.829> of<00:03:56.950> a<00:03:57.069> source<00:03:57.370> ie<00:03:57.639> meter<00:03:58.060> type

00:03:58.379 --> 00:03:58.389 
this is sort of a source ie meter type

00:03:58.389 --> 00:04:02.160 
this is sort of a source ie meter type
format<00:04:00.389> doesn't<00:04:01.389> really<00:04:01.450> look<00:04:01.599> like<00:04:01.780> just<00:04:02.079> a

00:04:02.160 --> 00:04:02.170 
format doesn't really look like just a

00:04:02.170 --> 00:04:09.700 
format doesn't really look like just a
lot<00:04:02.319> of<00:04:02.439> books<00:04:02.650> loaded<00:04:03.099> up<00:04:03.219> on<00:04:03.400> it

00:04:09.700 --> 00:04:09.710 

00:04:09.710 --> 00:04:11.860 

let's<00:04:10.370> take<00:04:10.550> a<00:04:10.580> look<00:04:10.820> at<00:04:10.910> maybe<00:04:11.060> the<00:04:11.330> nook

00:04:11.860 --> 00:04:11.870 
let's take a look at maybe the nook

00:04:11.870 --> 00:04:13.840 
let's take a look at maybe the nook
reader<00:04:12.110> that<00:04:12.440> they<00:04:12.590> have<00:04:12.770> here<00:04:13.100> and<00:04:13.610> we<00:04:13.730> will

00:04:13.840 --> 00:04:13.850 
reader that they have here and we will

00:04:13.850 --> 00:04:21.090 
reader that they have here and we will
have<00:04:14.090> some<00:04:14.390> better<00:04:14.600> luck

00:04:21.090 --> 00:04:21.100 

00:04:21.100 --> 00:04:23.670 

yeah<00:04:21.730> it<00:04:22.030> looks<00:04:22.210> like<00:04:22.330> one<00:04:23.230> of<00:04:23.260> the<00:04:23.410> things

00:04:23.670 --> 00:04:23.680 
yeah it looks like one of the things

00:04:23.680 --> 00:04:26.670 
yeah it looks like one of the things
here<00:04:23.920> at<00:04:24.220> computex<00:04:25.030> is<00:04:25.260> Wi-Fi<00:04:26.260> internet

00:04:26.670 --> 00:04:26.680 
here at computex is Wi-Fi internet

00:04:26.680 --> 00:04:28.680 
here at computex is Wi-Fi internet
connections<00:04:27.250> are<00:04:27.430> a<00:04:27.460> few<00:04:27.700> and<00:04:27.820> far<00:04:27.940> between<00:04:28.090> so

00:04:28.680 --> 00:04:28.690 
connections are a few and far between so

00:04:28.690 --> 00:04:29.940 
connections are a few and far between so
it's<00:04:28.840> kind<00:04:29.020> of<00:04:29.050> really<00:04:29.200> hard<00:04:29.380> to<00:04:29.530> kind<00:04:29.710> of<00:04:29.740> show

00:04:29.940 --> 00:04:29.950 
it's kind of really hard to kind of show

00:04:29.950 --> 00:04:32.400 
it's kind of really hard to kind of show
you<00:04:29.980> guys<00:04:30.250> a<00:04:30.610> lot<00:04:31.240> of<00:04:31.360> the<00:04:31.450> functionality<00:04:31.630> then

00:04:32.400 --> 00:04:32.410 
you guys a lot of the functionality then

00:04:32.410 --> 00:04:34.320 
you guys a lot of the functionality then
necessitates<00:04:33.040> an<00:04:33.190> internet<00:04:33.490> connection<00:04:33.580> but

00:04:34.320 --> 00:04:34.330 
necessitates an internet connection but

00:04:34.330 --> 00:04:36.060 
necessitates an internet connection but
let's<00:04:34.510> take<00:04:34.660> a<00:04:34.690> look<00:04:34.930> at<00:04:35.050> the<00:04:35.380> acer<00:04:35.680> camera

00:04:36.060 --> 00:04:36.070 
let's take a look at the acer camera

00:04:36.070 --> 00:04:39.900 
let's take a look at the acer camera
here<00:04:37.500> so<00:04:38.500> you<00:04:38.590> can<00:04:38.860> see<00:04:38.890> here<00:04:39.490> this<00:04:39.640> is<00:04:39.700> the

00:04:39.900 --> 00:04:39.910 
here so you can see here this is the

00:04:39.910 --> 00:04:45.110 
here so you can see here this is the
rear<00:04:40.540> facing<00:04:41.410> camera

00:04:45.110 --> 00:04:45.120 

00:04:45.120 --> 00:05:01.700 

of<00:04:45.540> course<00:04:46.220> video<00:04:47.220> and<00:04:47.960> pictures

00:05:01.700 --> 00:05:01.710 

00:05:01.710 --> 00:05:04.970 

okay<00:05:02.520> so<00:05:02.580> I<00:05:02.760> mean<00:05:03.090> acer<00:05:04.020> has<00:05:04.050> bundled<00:05:04.650> a<00:05:04.740> lot<00:05:04.890> of

00:05:04.970 --> 00:05:04.980 
okay so I mean acer has bundled a lot of

00:05:04.980 --> 00:05:06.800 
okay so I mean acer has bundled a lot of
its<00:05:05.100> own<00:05:05.220> software<00:05:05.400> on<00:05:05.670> here<00:05:05.910> whether<00:05:06.210> it's

00:05:06.800 --> 00:05:06.810 
its own software on here whether it's

00:05:06.810 --> 00:05:08.540 
its own software on here whether it's
are<00:05:07.020> actually<00:05:07.500> released<00:05:07.950> with<00:05:08.220> all<00:05:08.370> these

00:05:08.540 --> 00:05:08.550 
are actually released with all these

00:05:08.550 --> 00:05:11.780 
are actually released with all these
software's<00:05:09.180> like<00:05:09.780> the<00:05:10.320> nuke<00:05:10.560> reader<00:05:10.920> whether

00:05:11.780 --> 00:05:11.790 
software's like the nuke reader whether

00:05:11.790 --> 00:05:15.290 
software's like the nuke reader whether
they<00:05:12.030> have<00:05:12.210> this<00:05:12.420> less<00:05:12.900> Sam<00:05:13.200> point<00:05:13.680> 40<00:05:14.370> slide

00:05:15.290 --> 00:05:15.300 
they have this less Sam point 40 slide
