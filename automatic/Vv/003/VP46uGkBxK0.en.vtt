00:00:00.870 --> 00:00:05.040
 good guys are left I hope this 

00:00:03.420 --> 00:00:06.359
 video is going to be about my tattoos and 

00:00:05.040 --> 00:00:08.400
 the reason why I wear them in the 

00:00:06.359 --> 00:00:11.360
 body so I hope you enjoy 

00:00:08.400 --> 00:00:11.360
 inside 

00:00:14.840 --> 00:00:19.520
 to start now I have 7 

00:00:17.150 --> 00:00:22.880
 tattoos the first tattoo I did it to 

00:00:19.520 --> 00:00:25.160
 the 19 and a half years doing so far 

00:00:22.880 --> 00:00:28.610
 I'm 21 if I tell you the truth when 

00:00:25.160 --> 00:00:30.500
 I was 16 between 15 and 16 years old and now 

00:00:28.610 --> 00:00:34.730
 those who said that you are never going to make a 

00:00:30.500 --> 00:00:37.629
 tattoo or that never leaves virgin and already 

00:00:34.730 --> 00:00:41.090
 they warned me with two piercings on 

00:00:37.629 --> 00:00:43.129
 nostalgia and gives her away and got everything almost 

00:00:41.090 --> 00:00:45.230
 my skin ends up succumbing as I said 

00:00:43.129 --> 00:00:47.210
 the first tattoo tells me at 19 

00:00:45.230 --> 00:00:49.160
 in my first year of career I was 

00:00:47.210 --> 00:00:51.250
 quite some time thinking about what I was going to 

00:00:49.160 --> 00:00:54.260
 do and where on the subject of pain 

00:00:51.250 --> 00:00:56.719
 I honestly have gotten really scared 

00:00:54.260 --> 00:00:59.480
 all for hard tattoos that if they hurt 

00:00:56.719 --> 00:01:02.150
 that followed reality 

00:00:59.480 --> 00:01:04.340
 and other shits that we attach 

00:01:02.150 --> 00:01:06.770
 my first tattoo tells me on the wrist 

00:01:04.340 --> 00:01:09.380
 left and is the symbol of love 

00:01:06.770 --> 00:01:11.510
 infinite is to say an infinity mixed 

00:01:09.380 --> 00:01:14.330
 with the symbol of a heart you think 

00:01:11.510 --> 00:01:15.980
 because this bitch does not add to the ix every time 

00:01:14.330 --> 00:01:18.230
 I'm basically a pretty person 

00:01:15.980 --> 00:01:20.000
 sensitive I 've always been and love has 

00:01:18.230 --> 00:01:21.500
 been itself a constant thing in my life 

00:01:20.000 --> 00:01:23.720
 and I logically think that love 

00:01:21.500 --> 00:01:25.610
 both can be the best and the worst 

00:01:23.720 --> 00:01:28.550
 that can happen to you if I say that it will 

00:01:25.610 --> 00:01:30.470
 by both ways and it is infinite is the 

00:01:28.550 --> 00:01:31.730
 feeling that I love people most and that 

00:01:30.470 --> 00:01:33.740
 can make even the person more 

00:01:31.730 --> 00:01:36.100
 rope lose my head and also I 

00:01:33.740 --> 00:01:38.259
 he says because I'm shit 

00:01:36.100 --> 00:01:40.720
 the second and third tattoo friends and 

00:01:38.259 --> 00:01:43.780
 of the same day that one is on the wrist 

00:01:40.720 --> 00:01:45.900
 right and another on the left foot the 

00:01:43.780 --> 00:01:48.390
 left wrist I made an anchor 

00:01:45.900 --> 00:01:51.030
 for two years or so I did 

00:01:48.390 --> 00:01:53.550
 candle and it was a great feeling and 

00:01:51.030 --> 00:01:55.950
 he learned a lot of things and it was a 

00:01:53.550 --> 00:01:57.990
 quite liberating situation and with this 

00:01:55.950 --> 00:02:01.830
 the meaning of the tattoo comes a little 

00:01:57.990 --> 00:02:05.790
 of an anchor in the class symbolizes that no 

00:02:01.830 --> 00:02:08.610
 I must stagnate in a place to stagnate and 

00:02:05.790 --> 00:02:11.890
 some thoughts must raise the 

00:02:08.610 --> 00:02:14.410
 anchor and let everything flow 

00:02:11.890 --> 00:02:15.910
 but in the same way yes I know 

00:02:14.410 --> 00:02:18.490
 that is in the hand but the thing is the 

00:02:15.910 --> 00:02:20.319
 metaphor to have your feet on the ground and not 

00:02:18.490 --> 00:02:22.000
 to get too excited about things in 

00:02:20.319 --> 00:02:23.860
 the right foot tells me the symbol of 

00:02:22.000 --> 00:02:25.569
 openings science then it is known is 

00:02:23.860 --> 00:02:28.120
 the portal videogame a game 

00:02:25.569 --> 00:02:29.920
 wonderful that I recommend that I want 

00:02:28.120 --> 00:02:32.170
 pretty geek of this video game at 

00:02:29.920 --> 00:02:34.240
 same as my best friend and the two others 

00:02:32.170 --> 00:02:37.180
 we made the same tattoo in the same 

00:02:34.240 --> 00:02:39.880
 good place on the other foot so 

00:02:37.180 --> 00:02:42.310
 when we are always out there we teach 

00:02:39.880 --> 00:02:44.620
 our friendship tattoo that was 

00:02:42.310 --> 00:02:48.190
 that we both liked and it's something that 

00:02:44.620 --> 00:02:50.980
 yes connect us also sorry for nothing 

00:02:48.190 --> 00:02:53.560
 the fourth militia tattoo with 20 years and 

00:02:50.980 --> 00:02:55.300
 is the strength I do not know if you will know the 

00:02:53.560 --> 00:02:57.340
 videogames the legend of zelda but 

00:02:55.300 --> 00:02:59.410
 how is it so fashionable, I sure think 

00:02:57.340 --> 00:03:00.730
 that all his teams from shit the 

00:02:59.410 --> 00:03:02.980
 you have already played you know what beats 

00:03:00.730 --> 00:03:05.530
 force is composed of power the 

00:03:02.980 --> 00:03:07.810
 wisdom and value and are elements that 

00:03:05.530 --> 00:03:11.340
 is the truth value quite especially 

00:03:07.810 --> 00:03:11.340
 the wisdom and why 

00:03:13.220 --> 00:03:18.090
 could cell geek 

00:03:16.020 --> 00:03:20.340
 the fifth tattoo is only also 

00:03:18.090 --> 00:03:22.560
 related to the cell in this case is 

00:03:20.340 --> 00:03:24.030
 the immediate ocarina all behind the 

00:03:22.560 --> 00:03:26.040
 ear and the truth 

00:03:24.030 --> 00:03:28.440
 the treaty promised me enough fear 

00:03:26.040 --> 00:03:30.630
 with this nothing told me it's going to hurt and I 

00:03:28.440 --> 00:03:32.370
 I said then another experience and we 

00:03:30.630 --> 00:03:35.850
 we put to it and honestly I did not feel 

00:03:32.370 --> 00:03:38.550
 nothing result was great I loved it and 

00:03:35.850 --> 00:03:40.860
 though hardly looks quite like me 

00:03:38.550 --> 00:03:42.960
 is this tattoo is a geek tattoo on 

00:03:40.860 --> 00:03:44.880
 this case about star wars is a stop 

00:03:42.960 --> 00:03:47.400
 trooper or blog of the empire as you wish 

00:03:44.880 --> 00:03:49.650
 call it with two hundred in one they put a 

00:03:47.400 --> 00:03:51.930
 cannes that is the appearance and other 

00:03:49.650 --> 00:03:53.970
 skin is to say what behavior and it comes 

00:03:51.930 --> 00:03:55.860
 to mean that by very same as 

00:03:53.970 --> 00:03:57.420
 we can look at the naked eye or by 

00:03:55.860 --> 00:03:59.790
 all our way of dressing 

00:03:57.420 --> 00:04:01.740
 we practice two equal does not mean that 

00:03:59.790 --> 00:04:03.300
 we behave in the same way is 

00:04:01.740 --> 00:04:05.610
 Say your way of dressing does not judge your 

00:04:03.300 --> 00:04:07.650
 personality and is a bit critical this 

00:04:05.610 --> 00:04:08.790
 society sincerely that's not deal 

00:04:07.650 --> 00:04:11.560
 bach is that I like the most for his 

00:04:08.790 --> 00:04:16.250
 meaning more than by its design itself 

00:04:11.560 --> 00:04:17.540
 basically the truth I'm happy with 

00:04:16.250 --> 00:04:20.060
 the result but it could have been 

00:04:17.540 --> 00:04:22.360
 better anyway thanks Ivan 

00:04:20.060 --> 00:04:24.520
 because I was coughing 

00:04:22.360 --> 00:04:26.319
 and the seventh of the last trip to the 

00:04:24.520 --> 00:04:27.759
 date that I did it this summer is 

00:04:26.319 --> 00:04:29.620
 based on a front port song 

00:04:27.759 --> 00:04:31.990
 chester round and basically it's the 

00:04:29.620 --> 00:04:34.360
 first verse of the dance song sub 

00:04:31.990 --> 00:04:35.949
 trailer of day parade and that comes to 

00:04:34.360 --> 00:04:39.030
 mean a little bit I'm sick of 

00:04:35.949 --> 00:04:41.800
 the storms are bad storms and 

00:04:39.030 --> 00:04:43.569
 psychological so to speak lately 

00:04:41.800 --> 00:04:46.449
 I've been with a lot of shit that I keep 

00:04:43.569 --> 00:04:49.300
 being and with that song I felt 

00:04:46.449 --> 00:04:51.490
 quite identified and I wanted to have it 

00:04:49.300 --> 00:04:53.979
 on my skin in a symbolic way to 

00:04:51.490 --> 00:04:55.479
 that is always with me is the best 

00:04:53.979 --> 00:04:57.279
 tattoo that I have to date in addition 

00:04:55.479 --> 00:04:58.930
 I have a video of how this was done 

00:04:57.279 --> 00:05:02.349
 tattoo so if you want to see us what 

00:04:58.930 --> 00:05:05.199
 he left around here somewhere and you look at him 

00:05:02.349 --> 00:05:06.610
 if you give me a little more visits these 

00:05:05.199 --> 00:05:08.409
 they are all the trips that I have until 

00:05:06.610 --> 00:05:10.270
 now surely I will do many more 

00:05:08.409 --> 00:05:11.949
 especially for terms although now I 

00:05:10.270 --> 00:05:14.590
 I'm doing rather legs are not 

00:05:11.949 --> 00:05:15.360
 so easy to see but I like that more 

00:05:14.590 --> 00:05:17.159

00:05:15.360 --> 00:05:19.550
 until they have money to make me more 

00:05:17.159 --> 00:05:21.890
