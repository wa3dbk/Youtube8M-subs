team again and then I think there was

00:02:09.380 --> 00:02:09.390 
as well for some reason which didn't

00:02:09.390 --> 00:02:11.330 
as well for some reason which didn't
really<00:02:09.420> have<00:02:09.720> the<00:02:09.750> perfect<00:02:10.080> chemistry<00:02:10.440> it<00:02:11.160> was

00:02:11.330 --> 00:02:11.340 
really have the perfect chemistry it was

00:02:11.340 --> 00:02:13.040 
really have the perfect chemistry it was
chipped<00:02:11.610> in<00:02:11.790> with<00:02:11.910> the<00:02:12.090> first<00:02:12.270> chance<00:02:12.660> yep

obvious you're going to chip it and that

00:04:17.400 --> 00:04:19.820 
obvious you're going to chip it and that
meant<00:04:17.580> he<00:04:17.640> would<00:04:17.940> save<00:04:18.299> it<00:04:18.480> again<00:04:18.840> me<00:04:19.560> trying

00:04:22.010 --> 00:04:22.020 
out a chip and failing it before I

00:04:22.020 --> 00:04:24.150

00:04:26.190 --> 00:04:26.200 
in this match and this time around I

00:04:26.200 --> 00:04:29.340 
in this match and this time around I
decided<00:04:26.650> not<00:04:27.580> to<00:04:27.820> go<00:04:27.970> for<00:04:28.210> the<00:04:28.240> chip<00:04:28.570> I<00:04:28.810> think

00:04:29.340 --> 00:04:29.350 
decided not to go for the chip I think

00:04:29.350 --> 00:04:31.230 
decided not to go for the chip I think
it<00:04:29.470> would<00:04:29.560> be<00:04:29.590> what<00:04:29.920> I'll<00:04:30.040> try<00:04:30.310> to<00:04:30.340> do<00:04:30.610> in<00:04:31.150> a

00:04:31.230 --> 00:04:31.240 
it would be what I'll try to do in a

00:04:31.240 --> 00:04:32.640 
it would be what I'll try to do in a
game<00:04:31.270> first<00:04:31.870> time<00:04:32.050> I<00:04:32.080> get<00:04:32.230> a<00:04:32.260> penalty<00:04:32.470> I

00:04:32.640 --> 00:04:32.650 
game first time I get a penalty I

00:04:32.650 --> 00:04:34.590 
game first time I get a penalty I
probably<00:04:33.010> chart<00:04:33.280> try<00:04:33.520> for<00:04:33.730> the<00:04:33.790> chip<00:04:34.000> and<00:04:34.180> if<00:04:34.480> I

00:04:34.590 --> 00:04:34.600 
probably chart try for the chip and if I

00:04:34.600 --> 00:04:36.570 
probably chart try for the chip and if I
miss<00:04:34.780> it<00:04:34.810> I'll<00:04:35.080> go<00:04:35.230> for<00:04:35.440> a<00:04:35.500> reckless<00:04:35.890> shot<00:04:36.130> it

00:04:36.570 --> 00:04:36.580 
miss it I'll go for a reckless shot it

00:04:36.580 --> 00:04:38.190 
miss it I'll go for a reckless shot it

00:04:52.150 --> 00:04:54.660 
with a face shot and tried to run on
through<00:04:52.420> bad<00:04:52.840> idea<00:04:53.320> I<00:04:53.380> got<00:04:53.680> the<00:04:53.860> bold<00:04:54.100> pasta<00:04:54.550> to

through bad idea I got the bold pasta to

00:04:54.670 --> 00:04:57.000 
through bad idea I got the bold pasta to
chant<00:04:55.150> and<00:04:55.360> I<00:04:55.690> just<00:04:55.870> launched<00:04:56.620> that<00:04:56.740> with<00:04:56.980> a

00:04:57.000 --> 00:04:57.010 
chant and I just launched that with a

00:04:57.010 --> 00:04:59.850 
chant and I just launched that with a
long<00:04:57.400> pause<00:04:57.760> from<00:04:58.360> my<00:04:58.600> own<00:04:58.780> half<00:04:59.080> into<00:04:59.800> the

00:04:59.850 --> 00:04:59.860 
long pause from my own half into the

00:04:59.860 --> 00:05:02.040 
long pause from my own half into the
back<00:05:00.130> of<00:05:00.160> the<00:05:00.370> net<00:05:00.550> it<00:05:00.670> was<00:05:00.760> it<00:05:01.150> roll<00:05:01.570> over<00:05:01.930> the

back of the net it was it roll over the

00:05:02.050 --> 00:05:05.010 
back of the net it was it roll over the

line and make it a free one and that

00:05:05.020 --> 00:05:06.750 
line and make it a free one and that
would<00:05:05.170> see<00:05:05.380> my<00:05:05.560> opponent<00:05:06.070> rates<00:05:06.280> quit<00:05:06.580> for

00:05:06.750 --> 00:05:06.760 
would see my opponent rates quit for

00:05:06.760 --> 00:05:08.490 
would see my opponent rates quit for
some<00:05:06.970> reason<00:05:07.330> he<00:05:07.420> quit<00:05:07.690> in<00:05:07.810> the<00:05:07.930> 19th<00:05:08.440> minute

00:05:08.490 --> 00:05:08.500 
some reason he quit in the 19th minute

00:05:08.500 --> 00:05:10.530 
some reason he quit in the 19th minute
which<00:05:09.370> in<00:05:09.550> my<00:05:09.640> opinion<00:05:09.760> is<00:05:10.060> a<00:05:10.150> little<00:05:10.420> bit

00:05:10.530 --> 00:05:10.540 
which in my opinion is a little bit

00:05:10.540 --> 00:05:13.140 
which in my opinion is a little bit

00:05:27.450 --> 00:05:27.460 
the match into the boxee I would try out

the match into the boxee I would try out
the<00:05:27.640> shot<00:05:27.970> and<00:05:28.210> this<00:05:28.690> was<00:05:29.140> perhaps<00:05:29.530> one<00:05:29.830> spot

00:05:30.390 --> 00:05:30.400 
the shot and this was perhaps one spot

00:05:30.400 --> 00:05:31.650 
the shot and this was perhaps one spot
where<00:05:30.610> could<00:05:30.850> have<00:05:30.940> chipped<00:05:31.180> if<00:05:31.360> we<00:05:31.540> run

00:05:31.650 --> 00:05:31.660 
where could have chipped if we run

00:05:31.660 --> 00:05:33.210 
where could have chipped if we run
because<00:05:32.020> next<00:05:32.200> time<00:05:32.410> i<00:05:32.470> got<00:05:32.680> a<00:05:32.740> chance<00:05:32.980> with

00:05:39.659 --> 00:05:39.669 
time around I should probably be nested

time around I should probably be nested
I<00:05:39.910> just<00:05:40.210> messed<00:05:40.660> up<00:05:40.840> my<00:05:40.900> chances<00:05:41.350> but

00:05:56.040 --> 00:05:56.050 
was probably my toughest opponent off

00:05:56.050 --> 00:05:58.530

and<00:06:02.440> he<00:06:02.710> was<00:06:02.860> definitely<00:06:03.520> a<00:06:03.550> strong<00:06:03.940> opponent

00:06:04.230 --> 00:06:04.240
