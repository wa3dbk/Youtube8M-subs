00:01:21.440 --> 00:01:21.450 
cracked a little because the dough the

00:01:21.450 --> 00:01:23.780 
cracked a little because the dough the
gum<00:01:21.630> paste<00:01:21.840> was<00:01:22.140> kind<00:01:22.350> of<00:01:22.439> very<00:01:23.189> warm<00:01:23.610> because

00:01:26.810 --> 00:01:26.820 
I was kneeling on it and when it dries

00:01:26.820 --> 00:01:30.590 
I was kneeling on it and when it dries
the<00:01:27.420> AC<00:01:27.659> was<00:01:28.020> very<00:01:28.290> like<00:01:28.710> high<00:01:29.280> in<00:01:29.759> the<00:01:30.090> cracks

00:01:30.590 --> 00:01:30.600 
the AC was very like high in the cracks

00:01:30.600 --> 00:01:34.340 
the AC was very like high in the cracks
because<00:01:30.900> he<00:01:31.229> drives<00:01:31.799> too<00:01:32.189> fast<00:01:32.240> so<00:01:33.240> don't<00:01:34.020> you

00:01:34.340 --> 00:01:34.350 
because he drives too fast so don't you

00:01:34.350 --> 00:01:36.350

think all that was for me I was just for
this<00:01:36.450> type<00:01:36.630> by<00:01:36.780> step<00:01:37.049> if<00:01:37.320> it<00:01:37.470> was<00:01:37.590> for<00:01:37.770> a<00:01:37.799> cake

00:01:37.969 --> 00:01:37.979
