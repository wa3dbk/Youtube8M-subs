00:01:29.479 --> 00:01:34.729
 If they do not like it, they have also 

00:01:31.820 --> 00:01:36.070
 done I have a second chance not to 

00:01:34.729 --> 00:01:38.869
 sometimes he says now that he will like it 

00:01:36.070 --> 00:01:42.259

00:01:38.869 --> 00:01:44.960

 I hope you like it and please do not 

00:02:02.549 --> 00:02:07.340
 registering is super important because 

00:02:05.100 --> 00:02:09.780

00:02:07.340 --> 00:02:11.850
 because this hearing just now 

00:02:09.780 --> 00:02:14.220
 it's barely audition and it was going to be 

00:02:11.850 --> 00:02:16.110
 contest so this Friday is this 

00:02:14.220 --> 00:02:16.590
 Friday is the audition so I do not know 

00:02:16.110 --> 00:02:20.100
