00:00:05.250 --> 00:00:11.030
 hello Italy trays I have seen 500 of india and today I will show you how it is 

00:00:11.030 --> 00:00:12.229
 makes 

00:00:12.229 --> 00:00:15.529
 the agreement of a valve bike transmitter 

00:00:15.529 --> 00:00:22.369
 in this state we are talking about a model ts 520 s an excellent device that 

00:00:22.369 --> 00:00:24.409
 uses two final valves 

00:00:24.409 --> 00:00:27.409
 61 46 b 

00:00:27.919 --> 00:00:30.819
 the first thing to do 

00:00:30.819 --> 00:00:34.630
 obviously set transceiver on the dummy load 

00:00:34.630 --> 00:00:37.410
 if not disturb in frequency 

00:00:37.410 --> 00:00:41.610
 first of all yes to the reception driver check 

00:00:42.520 --> 00:00:43.770
 up to hear 

00:00:43.770 --> 00:00:48.200
 the peak of maximum noise on the receiver which means to edit 

00:00:48.200 --> 00:00:51.340
 the receiver's agreement are tuned to the frequency 

00:00:53.260 --> 00:00:58.810
 in this case we are 80 meters fin then we will put the bibanda switch 

00:00:58.810 --> 00:01:00.730
 on tuning 

00:01:00.730 --> 00:01:03.340
 Set It 

00:01:03.340 --> 00:01:06.340
 more or less in mid-band and control 

00:01:07.050 --> 00:01:09.670
 on the frequency of 3 mediums half 

00:01:09.670 --> 00:01:12.590
 swimming we can hold in position 1 

00:01:12.590 --> 00:01:15.650
 we put that power to a minimum 

00:01:15.650 --> 00:01:19.870
 at this point so clear furniture inter on the measure 

00:01:19.870 --> 00:01:21.010
 of the 

00:01:21.010 --> 00:01:24.300
 by elleci 

00:01:24.300 --> 00:01:27.570
 we carry the transceiver in transmission 

00:01:27.570 --> 00:01:31.299
 and we raise the power until we see a deflection on the Swiss 

00:01:33.920 --> 00:01:36.310
 ogame reception 

00:01:36.310 --> 00:01:39.440
 we return and transmission and we do 

00:01:39.440 --> 00:01:40.410
 the peak 

00:01:40.410 --> 00:01:43.410
 with the driver on the lc 

00:01:46.390 --> 00:01:49.620
 very quickly here it is 

00:01:49.620 --> 00:01:54.070
 once the small input is made we move the pointer to the measurement 

00:01:54.070 --> 00:01:56.460
 of the current xp 

00:01:56.460 --> 00:01:58.570
 we return to transmission 

00:01:58.570 --> 00:02:01.640
 and find my position 

00:02:01.640 --> 00:02:02.810
 of the playit 

00:02:02.810 --> 00:02:05.810
 regret of the current must mark the minimum value 

00:02:12.039 --> 00:02:13.919
 at this point 

00:02:13.919 --> 00:02:16.399
 we bring on rss 

00:02:16.399 --> 00:02:20.270
 change transmission we find the maximum power point 

00:02:20.270 --> 00:02:23.270
 with the swimming command 

00:02:26.289 --> 00:02:29.479
 this. we increase the power 

00:02:29.479 --> 00:02:30.809
 to complain 

00:02:30.809 --> 00:02:32.759
 and let's do the peak again 

00:02:32.759 --> 00:02:35.759
 demi lovato 

00:02:38.359 --> 00:02:41.719
 let's move on double cv 

00:02:41.719 --> 00:02:45.579
 me we find the peak of power this. we will be at maximum power 

00:02:45.579 --> 00:02:48.579
 of the parade 

00:02:49.179 --> 00:02:51.779
 therefore maximum. 

00:02:51.779 --> 00:02:54.779
 current rabbit alberto de rossi 

00:02:56.389 --> 00:02:57.420
 digimon 

00:02:57.420 --> 00:02:58.920
 of the current with 

00:02:58.920 --> 00:03:01.639
 picnik 

00:03:01.639 --> 00:03:04.539
 at this point we can try to optimize 

00:03:04.539 --> 00:03:07.779
 always measuring the power of the driver 

00:03:07.779 --> 00:03:10.779
 asking to get a little bit stronger 

00:03:13.049 --> 00:03:16.159
 I would say that there is anyway 

00:03:16.159 --> 00:03:19.159
 now we see the result we held at baptism 

00:03:25.099 --> 00:03:28.099
 cultivation of 120 watts 

00:03:29.959 --> 00:03:31.619
 we are ready to transmit
