 sheet of molds or patterns that you find 

00:00:13.750 --> 00:00:21.190

 put each of the parts cut out 

00:00:21.190 --> 00:00:27.850
 on the mold sheet so that the 

00:00:23.110 --> 00:00:30.190
 visualize better to make the hoops or 

00:00:27.850 --> 00:00:33.010

00:00:34.589 --> 00:00:38.620
 paper punches or templates 

00:00:37.120 --> 00:00:41.500

 just in shape we will publish for you 

00:00:50.700 --> 00:00:55.670
 to paste all the parts we use a 

00:00:53.250 --> 00:00:55.670
 paper sheet 

00:00:57.420 --> 00:01:01.469
 we apply glue for paper of which 

00:00:59.550 --> 00:01:04.400
 we usually have at home in the part 

00:01:01.469 --> 00:01:07.080
 big face of our pepa pica 

00:01:04.400 --> 00:01:09.000
 so we will continue to apply glue on 

00:01:07.080 --> 00:01:11.880
 each of the parties and we're going 

00:01:09.000 --> 00:01:14.420
 fitting where the rings correspond 

00:01:11.880 --> 00:01:14.420
 of the eyes 

00:01:18.920 --> 00:01:21.939
 the cheek 

00:01:23.570 --> 00:01:26.500
 mouth 

00:01:27.500 --> 00:01:30.010
 i 

00:01:32.460 --> 00:01:43.550
 the eyes the division of the nose 

00:01:52.420 --> 00:01:58.450

00:02:01.270 --> 00:02:04.299

00:02:20.850 --> 00:02:25.820

00:02:23.330 --> 00:02:28.310
 then we cut the paper where 

00:02:25.820 --> 00:02:30.050
 we put our pepa pig and in the part 

00:02:28.310 --> 00:02:31.940
 from behind we paste a piece of tape 

00:02:30.050 --> 00:02:34.630
 magnetic that you can get in 

00:02:31.940 --> 00:02:34.630

00:02:38.730 --> 00:02:43.530
 surfaces that are not metallic you can 

00:02:41.099 --> 00:02:46.019
 use a piece of felt or ribbon 

00:02:43.530 --> 00:02:47.879
 double-sided if you want to take it off in 

00:02:46.019 --> 00:02:50.150
