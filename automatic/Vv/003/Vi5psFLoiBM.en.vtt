00:00:00.469 --> 00:00:05.160
 the solid body that was found in 

00:00:02.760 --> 00:00:07.200
 last July near thatta and well 

00:00:05.160 --> 00:00:08.580
 a meteorite martian the 

00:00:07.200 --> 00:00:12.719
 scientists have just confirmed 

00:00:08.580 --> 00:00:14.519
 and live on this plateau we will 

00:00:12.719 --> 00:00:19.380
 show you a fragment of this 

00:00:14.519 --> 00:00:21.600
 meteorite the solid body that was 

00:00:19.380 --> 00:00:24.090
 found last July near thatta 

00:00:21.600 --> 00:00:25.680
 and well a Martian meteorite 

00:00:24.090 --> 00:00:27.930
 scientists have just confirmed 

00:00:25.680 --> 00:00:30.480
 it was an inhabitant of tata who had 

00:00:27.930 --> 00:00:32.730
 found this little fragment of 5 grams on 

00:00:30.480 --> 00:00:36.660
 report released cowardly narrative story 

00:00:32.730 --> 00:00:39.120
 the ordinary-looking jugette your 

00:00:36.660 --> 00:00:40.800
 twenty times more than its weight of gold these 

00:00:39.120 --> 00:00:43.170
 fragments of meteorites come from 

00:00:40.800 --> 00:00:45.210
 the planet mars these extremely rare rocks have 

00:00:43.170 --> 00:00:47.399
 landed in the Tata region following 

00:00:45.210 --> 00:00:48.960
 a meteor shower this phenomenon does not 

00:00:47.399 --> 00:00:54.300
 occurs on average once all 

00:00:48.960 --> 00:00:57.840
 the 50 in theory you saw these falls 

00:00:54.300 --> 00:01:02.010
 observed and every 50 years they me 

00:00:57.840 --> 00:01:04.229
 would kill then falls in 1815 he is 

00:01:02.010 --> 00:01:07.979
 fell in France these cantons after it's 

00:01:04.229 --> 00:01:11.520
 ie in 1875 fell in India in 1911 

00:01:07.979 --> 00:01:14.070
 he was falling in Egypt and in 1962 he is 

00:01:11.520 --> 00:01:17.280
 fallen to nigeria etc when there is a 

00:01:14.070 --> 00:01:19.439
 Huge after the tonga dad these debris 

00:01:17.280 --> 00:01:21.570
 extraterrestrials are identified through 

00:01:19.439 --> 00:01:23.460
 their gaseous contents identical to the 

00:01:21.570 --> 00:01:23.850
 atmospheric composition of the planet 

00:01:23.460 --> 00:01:25.470
 March 

00:01:23.850 --> 00:01:30.930
 the price of these rocks to the rites reached 

00:01:25.470 --> 00:01:32.610
 the ten thousand dirhams the emission g 

00:01:30.930 --> 00:01:33.900
 who are going to be sent for x masses 

00:01:32.610 --> 00:01:36.119
 so they need to have the maximum 

00:01:33.900 --> 00:01:38.670
 information about the red planet by 

00:01:36.119 --> 00:01:42.259
 example a gram of the meteorite of 

00:01:38.670 --> 00:01:44.520
 tata it's worth 20 times a big gold 

00:01:42.259 --> 00:01:46.770
 until today no shipping 

00:01:44.520 --> 00:01:48.030
 Space has managed to bring back 

00:01:46.770 --> 00:01:50.159
 samples of this planet 

00:01:48.030 --> 00:01:51.840
 mysterious in analyzing the debris 

00:01:50.159 --> 00:01:54.829
 could help scientists to 

00:01:51.840 --> 00:01:57.299
 unlock the secrets of the red planet 

00:01:54.829 --> 00:01:59.729
 people had seen a light in the 

00:01:57.299 --> 00:02:01.909
 sky as well as the place of the fall here 

00:01:59.729 --> 00:02:01.909
 even 

00:02:02.390 --> 00:02:06.900
 it's a matter of luck some 

00:02:04.619 --> 00:02:08.729
 have found just a few grams 

00:02:06.900 --> 00:02:10.679
 others a little less some are there 

00:02:08.729 --> 00:02:12.709
 for two months they have nothing yet 

00:02:10.679 --> 00:02:12.709
 find
