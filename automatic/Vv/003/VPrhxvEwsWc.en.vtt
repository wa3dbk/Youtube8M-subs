00:00:10.400 --> 00:00:10.410 
background we do have the shipyard up

00:00:10.410 --> 00:00:12.799 
background we do have the shipyard up
and<00:00:10.590> running<00:00:10.980> and<00:00:11.250> in<00:00:11.490> our<00:00:11.639> hangar<00:00:12.030> bay<00:00:12.240> you're

00:00:12.799 --> 00:00:12.809 
and running and in our hangar bay you're

00:00:12.809 --> 00:00:14.419 
and running and in our hangar bay you're
going<00:00:13.110> to<00:00:13.230> be<00:00:13.320> able<00:00:13.349> to<00:00:13.650> see<00:00:13.860> that<00:00:14.009> we<00:00:14.160> actually

00:00:14.419 --> 00:00:14.429 
going to be able to see that we actually

00:00:14.429 --> 00:00:16.939 
going to be able to see that we actually
have<00:00:15.120> our<00:00:15.150> mining<00:00:15.630> drones<00:00:16.080> those<00:00:16.740> are<00:00:16.890> the

00:00:16.939 --> 00:00:16.949 
have our mining drones those are the

00:00:16.949 --> 00:00:19.429 
have our mining drones those are the
little<00:00:17.130> yellow<00:00:17.460> square<00:00:18.000> drones<00:00:18.359> so<00:00:19.289> that

00:00:19.429 --> 00:00:19.439 
little yellow square drones so that

00:00:19.439 --> 00:00:21.050 
little yellow square drones so that
means<00:00:19.650> we<00:00:19.830> will<00:00:20.039> actually<00:00:20.220> have<00:00:20.580> some<00:00:20.760> mining

00:00:21.050 --> 00:00:21.060 
means we will actually have some mining

00:00:21.060 --> 00:00:24.679 
means we will actually have some mining
footage<00:00:21.390> in<00:00:21.600> this<00:00:21.810> video<00:00:22.939> let's<00:00:23.939> go<00:00:24.090> ahead<00:00:24.359> and

00:00:24.679 --> 00:00:24.689 
footage in this video let's go ahead and

00:00:24.689 --> 00:00:26.990 
footage in this video let's go ahead and
jump<00:00:25.320> into<00:00:25.470> space<00:00:25.830> you<00:00:26.279> can<00:00:26.460> see<00:00:26.640> we<00:00:26.789> have<00:00:26.970> a

00:00:26.990 --> 00:00:27.000 
jump into space you can see we have a

00:00:27.000 --> 00:00:29.419 
jump into space you can see we have a
new<00:00:27.210> sky<00:00:27.510> box<00:00:27.779> so<00:00:28.260> the<00:00:28.710> sky<00:00:29.160> background

00:00:29.419 --> 00:00:29.429 
new sky box so the sky background

00:00:29.429 --> 00:00:30.980 
new sky box so the sky background
actually<00:00:30.090> has<00:00:30.240> a<00:00:30.269> little<00:00:30.599> bit<00:00:30.689> more<00:00:30.810> of<00:00:30.900> a

00:00:30.980 --> 00:00:30.990 
actually has a little bit more of a

00:00:30.990 --> 00:00:32.930 
actually has a little bit more of a
nebula<00:00:31.289> effect<00:00:31.859> with<00:00:32.070> different<00:00:32.430> clouds<00:00:32.669> and

00:00:32.930 --> 00:00:32.940 
nebula effect with different clouds and

00:00:32.940 --> 00:00:35.479 
nebula effect with different clouds and
things<00:00:33.149> we're<00:00:34.140> going<00:00:34.350> to<00:00:34.530> get<00:00:34.829> into<00:00:35.070> combat

00:00:35.479 --> 00:00:35.489 
things we're going to get into combat

00:00:35.489 --> 00:00:40.130 
things we're going to get into combat
here<00:00:35.910> with<00:00:36.210> an<00:00:36.570> enemy<00:00:37.290> ship<00:00:37.579> if<00:00:38.899> you're<00:00:39.899> going

00:00:40.130 --> 00:00:40.140 
here with an enemy ship if you're going

00:00:40.140 --> 00:00:42.740 
here with an enemy ship if you're going
to<00:00:40.410> move<00:00:41.010> across<00:00:41.340> space<00:00:41.879> quickly<00:00:42.360> you'll<00:00:42.540> want

00:00:42.740 --> 00:00:42.750 
to move across space quickly you'll want

00:00:42.750 --> 00:00:45.290 
to move across space quickly you'll want
to<00:00:42.809> use<00:00:42.870> micro<00:00:43.440> warp<00:00:43.649> which<00:00:44.040> is<00:00:44.280> shift<00:00:44.730> T<00:00:45.149> to

00:00:45.290 --> 00:00:45.300 
to use micro warp which is shift T to

00:00:45.300 --> 00:00:50.240 
to use micro warp which is shift T to
start<00:00:45.570> and<00:00:45.840> just<00:00:45.899> T<00:00:46.350> to<00:00:46.440> stop<00:00:46.710> and<00:00:49.100> let's<00:00:50.100> go

00:00:50.240 --> 00:00:50.250 
start and just T to stop and let's go

00:00:50.250 --> 00:00:52.790 
start and just T to stop and let's go
ahead<00:00:50.370> and<00:00:50.579> launch<00:00:51.300> some<00:00:51.870> of<00:00:51.899> our<00:00:52.260> combat

00:00:52.790 --> 00:00:52.800 
ahead and launch some of our combat

00:00:52.800 --> 00:00:54.889 
ahead and launch some of our combat
drones<00:00:53.039> to<00:00:53.280> help<00:00:53.460> us<00:00:53.610> out<00:00:53.730> here<00:00:54.000> you<00:00:54.600> can<00:00:54.750> see

00:00:54.889 --> 00:00:54.899 
drones to help us out here you can see

00:00:54.899 --> 00:00:56.689 
drones to help us out here you can see
on<00:00:54.989> the<00:00:55.079> right<00:00:55.230> hand<00:00:55.379> side<00:00:55.530> we<00:00:55.920> do<00:00:56.100> have<00:00:56.370> that

00:00:56.689 --> 00:00:56.699 
on the right hand side we do have that

00:00:56.699 --> 00:01:00.470 
on the right hand side we do have that
drone<00:00:57.600> control<00:00:58.309> open<00:00:59.309> up<00:00:59.399> that's<00:01:00.270> what's

00:01:00.470 --> 00:01:00.480 
drone control open up that's what's

00:01:00.480 --> 00:01:01.849 
drone control open up that's what's
going<00:01:00.660> to<00:01:00.780> allow<00:01:00.870> us<00:01:01.170> to<00:01:01.320> be<00:01:01.410> able<00:01:01.469> to<00:01:01.649> tell

all of the combat drones and yes we do
have<00:01:10.350> those<00:01:10.680> mining<00:01:11.070> drones<00:01:11.280> in<00:01:11.700> that<00:01:12.330> hangar

00:01:13.100 --> 00:01:13.110

00:01:13.110 --> 00:01:15.770 
have those mining drones in that hangar
bay

00:01:15.770 --> 00:01:15.780 

00:01:15.780 --> 00:01:18.840 

so<00:01:16.780> we<00:01:16.930> have<00:01:17.049> to<00:01:17.650> escort<00:01:18.009> cruisers<00:01:18.490> of<00:01:18.670> one

and<00:02:07.100> when<00:02:07.970> you<00:02:08.119> die<00:02:08.300> now<00:02:08.569> you<00:02:08.990> can<00:02:09.140> see<00:02:09.319> warning

00:02:09.820 --> 00:02:09.830 
and when you die now you can see warning

00:02:09.830 --> 00:02:11.680 
and when you die now you can see warning
window<00:02:09.979> so<00:02:10.489> that's<00:02:10.849> going<00:02:11.420> to<00:02:11.480> be<00:02:11.599> something

00:02:11.680 --> 00:02:11.690 
window so that's going to be something

00:02:11.690 --> 00:02:12.790 
window so that's going to be something
that<00:02:11.870> you're<00:02:12.050> going<00:02:12.140> to<00:02:12.200> be<00:02:12.319> able<00:02:12.349> to<00:02:12.650> actually

00:02:12.790 --> 00:02:12.800 
that you're going to be able to actually

00:02:12.800 --> 00:02:14.530 
that you're going to be able to actually
have<00:02:13.459> instead<00:02:13.790> of<00:02:13.910> just<00:02:14.060> getting<00:02:14.239> kicked

00:02:14.530 --> 00:02:14.540 
have instead of just getting kicked

00:02:14.540 --> 00:02:29.920 
have instead of just getting kicked
right<00:02:14.720> back<00:02:14.930> in<00:02:15.080> the<00:02:15.230> shipyard

00:02:29.920 --> 00:02:29.930 

00:02:29.930 --> 00:02:33.830 

now<00:02:31.070> looking<00:02:32.070> at<00:02:32.190> our<00:02:32.310> mining<00:02:32.520> drones<00:02:32.880> where

00:02:33.830 --> 00:02:33.840 
now looking at our mining drones where

00:02:33.840 --> 00:02:35.000 
now looking at our mining drones where
you're<00:02:33.930> going<00:02:34.080> to<00:02:34.200> be<00:02:34.260> using<00:02:34.440> them<00:02:34.740> for<00:02:34.800> i

00:02:35.000 --> 00:02:35.010 
you're going to be using them for i

00:02:35.010 --> 00:02:37.760 
you're going to be using them for i
should<00:02:35.250> say<00:02:35.460> is<00:02:35.750> mining<00:02:36.750> on<00:02:36.870> an<00:02:37.050> asteroids

00:02:37.760 --> 00:02:37.770 
should say is mining on an asteroids

00:02:37.770 --> 00:02:40.460 
should say is mining on an asteroids
right<00:02:38.220> now<00:02:38.400> you<00:02:38.790> do<00:02:39.000> have<00:02:39.150> it<00:02:39.270> simply<00:02:39.690> divine

00:02:40.460 --> 00:02:40.470 
right now you do have it simply divine

00:02:40.470 --> 00:02:43.400 
right now you do have it simply divine
on<00:02:40.890> an<00:02:41.220> asteroid<00:02:41.610> however<00:02:42.330> the<00:02:42.630> drones<00:02:43.140> will

00:02:43.400 --> 00:02:43.410 
on an asteroid however the drones will

00:02:43.410 --> 00:02:44.990 
on an asteroid however the drones will
not<00:02:43.590> return<00:02:43.920> to<00:02:44.100> your<00:02:44.160> ship<00:02:44.220> with<00:02:44.520> the<00:02:44.640> credits

00:02:44.990 --> 00:02:45.000 
not return to your ship with the credits

00:02:45.000 --> 00:02:48.110 
not return to your ship with the credits
yet<00:02:45.470> they<00:02:46.470> are<00:02:46.500> able<00:02:46.890> to<00:02:47.070> specify<00:02:47.730> what

00:02:48.110 --> 00:02:48.120 
yet they are able to specify what

00:02:48.120 --> 00:02:50.060 
yet they are able to specify what
resources<00:02:48.570> they<00:02:48.720> are<00:02:48.990> picking<00:02:49.290> up<00:02:49.530> so<00:02:49.770> that<00:02:49.890> is

00:02:50.060 --> 00:02:50.070 
resources they are picking up so that is

00:02:50.070 --> 00:02:51.380 
resources they are picking up so that is
on<00:02:50.250> the<00:02:50.340> back<00:02:50.520> end<00:02:50.790> it's<00:02:50.940> just<00:02:51.120> not<00:02:51.270> something

00:02:51.380 --> 00:02:51.390 
on the back end it's just not something

00:02:51.390 --> 00:02:53.420 
on the back end it's just not something
that<00:02:51.690> you're<00:02:51.780> able<00:02:51.930> to<00:02:52.140> see<00:02:52.380> in<00:02:52.680> this<00:02:53.130> patch

00:02:53.420 --> 00:02:53.430 
that you're able to see in this patch

00:02:53.430 --> 00:02:55.590 
that you're able to see in this patch
yet

00:02:55.590 --> 00:02:55.600 
yet

00:02:55.600 --> 00:02:58.500 
yet
so<00:02:56.140> we'll<00:02:56.290> go<00:02:56.440> ahead<00:02:56.560> and<00:02:57.010> fly<00:02:57.880> up<00:02:58.150> to<00:02:58.210> this

00:02:58.500 --> 00:02:58.510 
so we'll go ahead and fly up to this

00:02:58.510 --> 00:03:06.280 
so we'll go ahead and fly up to this
asteroid

00:03:06.280 --> 00:03:06.290 

00:03:06.290 --> 00:03:08.229 

I<00:03:06.409> didn't<00:03:07.069> realize<00:03:07.129> that<00:03:07.370> my<00:03:07.610> speed<00:03:07.879> was<00:03:08.030> so

00:03:08.229 --> 00:03:08.239 
I didn't realize that my speed was so

00:03:08.239 --> 00:03:10.780 
I didn't realize that my speed was so
high<00:03:08.480> so<00:03:09.379> we<00:03:09.409> do<00:03:09.739> end<00:03:09.890> up<00:03:09.950> exploding<00:03:10.280> into<00:03:10.640> that

00:03:10.780 --> 00:03:10.790 
high so we do end up exploding into that

00:03:10.790 --> 00:03:13.000 
high so we do end up exploding into that
particular<00:03:10.939> asteroid<00:03:11.689> let's<00:03:12.530> go<00:03:12.739> ahead<00:03:12.769> and

00:03:13.000 --> 00:03:13.010 
particular asteroid let's go ahead and

00:03:13.010 --> 00:03:16.119 
particular asteroid let's go ahead and
it<00:03:13.670> relaunched<00:03:14.299> to<00:03:14.840> an<00:03:14.989> asteroid<00:03:15.409> that<00:03:15.620> we<00:03:15.950> are

00:03:16.119 --> 00:03:16.129 
it relaunched to an asteroid that we are

00:03:16.129 --> 00:03:17.349 
it relaunched to an asteroid that we are
going<00:03:16.430> to<00:03:16.519> approach<00:03:16.730> a<00:03:16.879> little<00:03:17.120> bit<00:03:17.209> more

00:03:17.349 --> 00:03:17.359 
going to approach a little bit more

00:03:17.359 --> 00:03:19.929 
going to approach a little bit more
slowly<00:03:17.599> now<00:03:17.959> and<00:03:18.280> hopefully<00:03:19.280> not<00:03:19.609> end<00:03:19.819> up

00:03:19.929 --> 00:03:19.939 
slowly now and hopefully not end up

00:03:19.939 --> 00:03:23.110 
slowly now and hopefully not end up
exploding<00:03:21.340> we<00:03:22.340> just<00:03:22.489> did<00:03:22.609> a<00:03:22.640> quick<00:03:22.849> little

00:03:23.110 --> 00:03:23.120 
exploding we just did a quick little

00:03:23.120 --> 00:03:25.360 
exploding we just did a quick little
micro<00:03:23.510> warp<00:03:23.750> jump<00:03:23.989> to<00:03:24.200> this<00:03:24.349> asteroid<00:03:24.859> and<00:03:25.099> we

00:03:25.360 --> 00:03:25.370 
micro warp jump to this asteroid and we

00:03:25.370 --> 00:03:26.679 
micro warp jump to this asteroid and we
are<00:03:25.430> going<00:03:25.549> to<00:03:25.670> approach<00:03:26.000> it<00:03:26.180> what's<00:03:26.540> more

00:03:26.679 --> 00:03:26.689 
are going to approach it what's more

00:03:26.689 --> 00:03:33.460 
are going to approach it what's more
slowly<00:03:27.019> than<00:03:27.200> the<00:03:27.379> last<00:03:27.620> one<00:03:31.750> if<00:03:32.750> you<00:03:33.290> look

00:03:33.460 --> 00:03:33.470 
slowly than the last one if you look

00:03:33.470 --> 00:03:35.860 
slowly than the last one if you look
just<00:03:33.980> off<00:03:34.280> to<00:03:34.489> the<00:03:34.609> right<00:03:34.849> of<00:03:35.150> the<00:03:35.420> nose<00:03:35.629> of<00:03:35.840> my

00:03:35.860 --> 00:03:35.870 
just off to the right of the nose of my

00:03:35.870 --> 00:03:37.720 
just off to the right of the nose of my
ship<00:03:36.260> you<00:03:36.439> can<00:03:36.469> see<00:03:36.769> that<00:03:36.920> those<00:03:37.129> numbers<00:03:37.519> are

00:03:37.720 --> 00:03:37.730 
ship you can see that those numbers are

00:03:37.730 --> 00:03:41.679 
ship you can see that those numbers are
going<00:03:38.359> up<00:03:38.689> there<00:03:39.049> around<00:03:39.250> 88,000<00:03:40.250> now<00:03:40.370> that<00:03:41.329> is

00:03:41.679 --> 00:03:41.689 
going up there around 88,000 now that is

00:03:41.689 --> 00:03:45.429 
going up there around 88,000 now that is
my<00:03:42.230> ship's<00:03:42.620> shield<00:03:43.430> integrity<00:03:43.989> so<00:03:44.989> once<00:03:45.230> that

00:03:45.429 --> 00:03:45.439 
my ship's shield integrity so once that

00:03:45.439 --> 00:03:48.399 
my ship's shield integrity so once that
number<00:03:46.159> reaches<00:03:46.730> a<00:03:46.970> hundred<00:03:47.419> percent<00:03:47.629> my

00:03:48.399 --> 00:03:48.409 
number reaches a hundred percent my

00:03:48.409 --> 00:03:49.899 
number reaches a hundred percent my
shield<00:03:48.769> will<00:03:48.950> be<00:03:49.069> completely<00:03:49.519> functional

00:03:49.899 --> 00:03:49.909 
shield will be completely functional

00:03:49.909 --> 00:03:54.069 
shield will be completely functional
again<00:03:52.239> alright<00:03:53.239> so<00:03:53.389> we're<00:03:53.510> close<00:03:53.689> enough<00:03:53.720> to

00:03:54.069 --> 00:03:54.079 
again alright so we're close enough to

00:03:54.079 --> 00:03:55.990 
again alright so we're close enough to
this<00:03:54.169> asteroid<00:03:54.620> let's<00:03:54.859> go<00:03:55.040> ahead<00:03:55.310> and<00:03:55.549> deploy

00:03:55.990 --> 00:03:56.000 
this asteroid let's go ahead and deploy

00:03:56.000 --> 00:03:59.559 
this asteroid let's go ahead and deploy
those<00:03:56.629> mining<00:03:57.560> drones<00:03:58.209> again<00:03:59.209> they're<00:03:59.389> going

00:03:59.559 --> 00:03:59.569 
those mining drones again they're going

00:03:59.569 --> 00:04:01.809 
those mining drones again they're going
to<00:03:59.629> deploy<00:03:59.930> the<00:04:00.109> same<00:04:00.349> way<00:04:00.590> as<00:04:00.829> how<00:04:01.010> the<00:04:01.069> combat

00:04:01.809 --> 00:04:01.819 
to deploy the same way as how the combat

00:04:01.819 --> 00:04:03.849 
to deploy the same way as how the combat
drones<00:04:02.090> do<00:04:02.299> where<00:04:02.450> you<00:04:02.480> click<00:04:02.840> on<00:04:02.870> the<00:04:03.409> upward

00:04:03.849 --> 00:04:03.859 
drones do where you click on the upward

00:04:03.859 --> 00:04:05.770 
drones do where you click on the upward
facing<00:04:04.220> arrow<00:04:04.579> and<00:04:04.970> you're<00:04:05.239> going<00:04:05.450> to<00:04:05.569> see

00:04:05.770 --> 00:04:05.780 
facing arrow and you're going to see

00:04:05.780 --> 00:04:08.349 
facing arrow and you're going to see
them<00:04:05.930> pop<00:04:06.409> up<00:04:06.439> out<00:04:06.889> of<00:04:07.280> your<00:04:07.430> ship<00:04:07.730> and<00:04:07.939> see

00:04:08.349 --> 00:04:08.359 
them pop up out of your ship and see

00:04:08.359 --> 00:04:09.940 
them pop up out of your ship and see
their<00:04:08.569> control<00:04:09.049> or<00:04:09.230> open<00:04:09.560> up<00:04:09.650> on<00:04:09.829> the

00:04:09.940 --> 00:04:09.950 
their control or open up on the

00:04:09.950 --> 00:04:14.500 
their control or open up on the
right-hand<00:04:10.310> side<00:04:12.790> first<00:04:13.790> thing<00:04:14.000> is<00:04:14.209> to<00:04:14.239> make

00:04:14.500 --> 00:04:14.510 
right-hand side first thing is to make

00:04:14.510 --> 00:04:16.719 
right-hand side first thing is to make
sure<00:04:14.569> that<00:04:14.720> you<00:04:14.989> have<00:04:15.229> your<00:04:15.590> target<00:04:16.159> locked<00:04:16.459> on

00:04:16.719 --> 00:04:16.729 
sure that you have your target locked on

00:04:16.729 --> 00:04:19.270 
sure that you have your target locked on
so<00:04:17.150> you<00:04:17.239> click<00:04:17.900> on<00:04:18.019> the<00:04:18.169> asteroids<00:04:18.650> icon<00:04:19.099> and

00:04:19.270 --> 00:04:19.280 
so you click on the asteroids icon and

00:04:19.280 --> 00:04:20.890 
so you click on the asteroids icon and
you<00:04:19.340> press<00:04:19.609> the<00:04:19.760> letter<00:04:19.940> C<00:04:20.269> just<00:04:20.539> like<00:04:20.750> you're

00:04:49.930 --> 00:04:49.940 
drones are going to go back into a very

00:04:49.940 --> 00:04:52.510 
drones are going to go back into a very
basic<00:04:50.210> orbiting<00:04:50.930> formation<00:04:51.500> until<00:04:51.710> you<00:04:52.340> bring

00:04:52.510 --> 00:04:52.520 
basic orbiting formation until you bring

00:04:52.520 --> 00:04:55.270 
basic orbiting formation until you bring
them<00:04:52.730> back<00:04:52.880> to<00:04:53.030> the<00:04:53.150> ship<00:04:53.330> now<00:04:54.160> something<00:04:55.160> to

00:04:55.270 --> 00:04:55.280 
them back to the ship now something to

00:04:55.280 --> 00:04:56.680 
them back to the ship now something to

keep in mind is that when you tell

00:04:56.690 --> 00:04:59.320 
keep in mind is that when you tell
drones<00:04:56.990> to<00:04:57.260> return<00:04:57.560> to<00:04:57.680> the<00:04:57.770> ship<00:04:58.330> they're

00:04:59.320 --> 00:04:59.330 
drones to return to the ship they're

00:04:59.330 --> 00:05:00.970 
drones to return to the ship they're
going<00:04:59.540> to<00:04:59.660> do<00:04:59.780> it<00:04:59.930> in<00:05:00.080> the<00:05:00.380> same<00:05:00.650> order<00:05:00.950> that

00:05:00.970 --> 00:05:00.980 
going to do it in the same order that

00:05:00.980 --> 00:05:03.430 
going to do it in the same order that
you<00:05:01.130> sent<00:05:01.490> them<00:05:01.640> out<00:05:01.790> so<00:05:02.690> if<00:05:02.840> you<00:05:02.960> have<00:05:03.140> some

00:05:03.430 --> 00:05:03.440 
you sent them out so if you have some

00:05:03.440 --> 00:05:06.250 
you sent them out so if you have some
that<00:05:03.650> have<00:05:03.830> managed<00:05:04.280> to<00:05:04.750> wander<00:05:05.750> farther<00:05:06.020> away

00:05:06.250 --> 00:05:06.260 
that have managed to wander farther away

00:05:06.260 --> 00:05:08.140 
that have managed to wander farther away
than<00:05:06.530> others<00:05:06.920> they're<00:05:07.520> not<00:05:07.730> going<00:05:07.910> to<00:05:07.970> come

00:05:08.140 --> 00:05:08.150 
than others they're not going to come

00:05:08.150 --> 00:05:10.720 
than others they're not going to come
back<00:05:08.330> right<00:05:08.600> away<00:05:08.830> but<00:05:09.830> the<00:05:09.980> ones<00:05:10.160> that<00:05:10.310> would

00:05:10.720 --> 00:05:10.730 
back right away but the ones that would

00:05:10.730 --> 00:05:12.940 
back right away but the ones that would
be<00:05:10.940> after<00:05:11.570> them<00:05:11.690> in<00:05:11.870> the<00:05:11.960> order<00:05:12.140> are<00:05:12.470> going<00:05:12.830> to

00:05:12.940 --> 00:05:12.950 
be after them in the order are going to

00:05:12.950 --> 00:05:16.000 
be after them in the order are going to
just<00:05:13.190> wait<00:05:13.970> on<00:05:14.270> the<00:05:14.390> outskirts<00:05:14.960> until<00:05:15.560> the

00:05:16.000 --> 00:05:16.010 
just wait on the outskirts until the

00:05:16.010 --> 00:05:18.370 
just wait on the outskirts until the
previous<00:05:16.760> drugs<00:05:17.030> can<00:05:17.300> get<00:05:17.480> put<00:05:17.840> back<00:05:17.870> into<00:05:18.200> the

00:05:18.370 --> 00:05:18.380 
previous drugs can get put back into the

00:05:18.380 --> 00:05:20.710 
previous drugs can get put back into the
ship<00:05:18.520> this<00:05:19.520> is<00:05:19.670> also<00:05:19.940> important<00:05:20.330> to<00:05:20.510> note

00:05:20.710 --> 00:05:20.720 
ship this is also important to note

00:05:20.720 --> 00:05:23.710 
ship this is also important to note
because<00:05:21.050> as<00:05:21.590> the<00:05:21.650> drones<00:05:22.220> are<00:05:22.670> being<00:05:23.090> down<00:05:23.420> to

00:05:23.710 --> 00:05:23.720 
because as the drones are being down to

00:05:23.720 --> 00:05:25.780 
because as the drones are being down to
back<00:05:23.870> into<00:05:24.200> the<00:05:24.320> ship<00:05:24.380> we're<00:05:25.220> not<00:05:25.370> going<00:05:25.610> to<00:05:25.700> be

00:05:25.780 --> 00:05:25.790 
back into the ship we're not going to be

00:05:25.790 --> 00:05:29.890 
back into the ship we're not going to be
able<00:05:25.820> to<00:05:26.060> launch<00:05:26.300> new<00:05:26.870> drones<00:05:28.510> so<00:05:29.510> think<00:05:29.780> of<00:05:29.810> it

00:05:29.890 --> 00:05:29.900 
able to launch new drones so think of it

00:05:29.900 --> 00:05:32.860 
able to launch new drones so think of it
like<00:05:30.050> this<00:05:30.320> you<00:05:30.650> have<00:05:30.680> a<00:05:31.310> car<00:05:32.090> port<00:05:32.360> where<00:05:32.750> you

00:05:32.860 --> 00:05:32.870 
like this you have a car port where you

00:05:32.870 --> 00:05:35.320 
like this you have a car port where you
can<00:05:33.050> bring<00:05:33.200> a<00:05:33.380> car<00:05:33.590> and<00:05:34.160> also<00:05:34.850> have<00:05:35.090> another

00:05:35.320 --> 00:05:35.330 
can bring a car and also have another

00:05:35.330 --> 00:05:37.480 
can bring a car and also have another
car<00:05:35.630> come<00:05:35.810> out<00:05:35.960> they<00:05:36.680> can't<00:05:36.920> come<00:05:37.130> in<00:05:37.250> and<00:05:37.400> out

00:05:37.480 --> 00:05:37.490 
car come out they can't come in and out

00:05:37.490 --> 00:05:40.120 
car come out they can't come in and out
at<00:05:37.640> the<00:05:37.760> same<00:05:37.970> time<00:05:38.180> so<00:05:39.020> we<00:05:39.170> do<00:05:39.350> need<00:05:39.560> all<00:05:39.890> of

00:05:40.120 --> 00:05:40.130 
at the same time so we do need all of

00:05:40.130 --> 00:05:42.610 
at the same time so we do need all of
those<00:05:40.460> mining<00:05:41.270> drones<00:05:41.480> to<00:05:41.870> get<00:05:42.020> placed<00:05:42.320> back

00:05:42.610 --> 00:05:42.620 
those mining drones to get placed back

00:05:42.620 --> 00:05:44.800 
those mining drones to get placed back
into<00:05:42.860> our<00:05:43.070> ship<00:05:43.340> before<00:05:43.670> our<00:05:44.060> combat<00:05:44.510> drones

00:05:44.800 --> 00:05:44.810 
into our ship before our combat drones

00:05:44.810 --> 00:05:47.440 
into our ship before our combat drones
can<00:05:45.140> get<00:05:45.320> launched<00:05:45.770> you<00:05:46.520> can<00:05:46.670> see<00:05:46.880> that<00:05:46.910> we<00:05:47.180> do
