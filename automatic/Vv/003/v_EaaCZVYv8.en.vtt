00:00:15.949 --> 00:00:19.980
 I'm going to use my paint to demonstrate some very simple painting techniques for you 

00:00:19.980 --> 00:00:23.820
 Here I use the smallest of my brushes. I could use one that's bigger. 

00:00:23.820 --> 00:00:27.260
 The size doesn't mean that much. The most important thing is that you feel comfortable with the brush you use 

00:00:27.260 --> 00:00:33.810
 First, I will show you how to make soft brush strokes 

00:00:33.810 --> 00:00:39.140
 as you may have noticed, I paint in all directions. I just want to do it faster 

00:00:40.260 --> 00:00:43.330
 I do such techniques, this way. 

00:00:43.330 --> 00:00:45.800
 because I want to achieve one 

00:00:45.800 --> 00:00:47.550
 worn look. 

00:00:47.550 --> 00:00:50.740
 I prefer to paint these things 

00:00:50.740 --> 00:00:52.060
 also 

00:00:52.060 --> 00:00:53.550
 because it is much faster. 

00:00:53.550 --> 00:00:58.330
 and because I can get the brush to come in the paint 

00:00:58.330 --> 00:01:02.410
 by dipping rather hard and completely dry. On this piece you can see 

00:01:02.410 --> 00:01:06.180
 that the paint is thicker and more three-dimensional 

00:01:06.180 --> 00:01:09.649
 You should now wait about 20 minutes for the paint to dry 

00:01:09.649 --> 00:01:12.290
 How long depends on temperature and thickness. 

00:01:12.290 --> 00:01:15.930
 So now the next step is to show you I will now show you how to use wax. It is 

00:01:15.930 --> 00:01:20.240
 something that my students have become most fascinated by. 

00:01:20.240 --> 00:01:24.799
 So here you see my brush covered in wax. I also need a cloth. 

00:01:24.799 --> 00:01:28.300
 I paint over with wax and you can see the underlying paint 

00:01:28.300 --> 00:01:34.820
 because I have only applied a thin layer of wax. One should not put a wax layer on the paint 

00:01:34.820 --> 00:01:39.040
 But, as a student said, it must be like taking a hand cream 

00:01:39.040 --> 00:01:44.090
 You need so much to absorb it. Do not leave a layer 

00:01:44.090 --> 00:01:48.470
 so you walk around with very greasy hands .. 

00:01:48.470 --> 00:01:50.440
 When I finish applying wax 

00:01:50.440 --> 00:01:52.210
 I continue with 

00:01:52.210 --> 00:01:59.020
 wiping. Because there is metal downstairs, it should just be a light wipe 

00:01:59.020 --> 00:02:02.910
 so you can see a little bit of the underlying metal. Which I think looks good 

00:02:04.420 --> 00:02:07.640
 This is my Dark Wax. I know it looks really dark. 

00:02:07.640 --> 00:02:12.589
 And what I'm doing now, you'll probably be afraid of ... but 

00:02:12.589 --> 00:02:16.759
 As long as you have clear wax as a substrate, then it is no problem. 

00:02:16.759 --> 00:02:21.069
 Now I just wipe it off. Take it off quite easily. 

00:02:21.069 --> 00:02:26.109
 There is where the jet dipped the paint. I paint 

00:02:26.109 --> 00:02:33.059
 just. Then apply a little bit of clear wax 

00:02:33.059 --> 00:02:39.059
 which makes the surface lighter and leaves the dark places as 

00:02:39.059 --> 00:02:40.999
 cracks. 

00:02:40.999 --> 00:02:45.569
 This is just fine sandpaper. You can get it nicer. It just gets 

00:02:45.569 --> 00:02:52.569
 A little bit of the tree emerges and highlights a little bit of gold on the surface. 

00:02:52.779 --> 00:02:55.219
 I could inflict a little more 

00:02:55.219 --> 00:03:02.219
 clear wax.
