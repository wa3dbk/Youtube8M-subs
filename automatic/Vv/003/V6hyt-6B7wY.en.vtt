 the directors of the institution for 

00:02:11.290 --> 00:02:16.270
 then to know his possible future in the 

00:02:13.840 --> 00:02:19.000
 yellow box will not give the 

00:02:16.270 --> 00:02:21.790
 beautiful here in another another version that 

00:02:19.000 --> 00:02:23.520
 add something more olive that veiled the 

00:02:21.790 --> 00:02:25.300
 Press release 

00:02:23.520 --> 00:02:26.950
 it effectively reaches gonzalo 

00:02:25.300 --> 00:02:29.500
 castillejos but muds of him with the 

00:02:26.950 --> 00:02:31.830
 managers and then the talk to 

00:02:29.500 --> 00:02:35.100
 define if a 

00:02:31.830 --> 00:02:38.990
 interested in details good does not say that 

00:02:35.100 --> 00:02:42.230
 but the feeling interprets that it is like this 

00:02:38.990 --> 00:02:45.970
 or that there will be some that have to be tuned 

00:02:42.230 --> 00:02:45.970
 here and what if the player 

00:02:48.760 --> 00:02:52.640
 [Music] 

00:02:50.319 --> 00:02:56.350
 not so much 100% but 

00:02:52.640 --> 00:02:56.350
 physically i feel good 

00:02:58.780 --> 00:03:02.260
 the truth 

00:03:00.610 --> 00:03:05.110
 and 

00:03:02.260 --> 00:03:08.170
 I have to keep training the doctor or 

00:03:05.110 --> 00:03:09.700
 the teacher will decide when he plays some 

00:03:08.170 --> 00:03:11.650
 type of school 

00:03:09.700 --> 00:03:13.120
 at the moment not if it is true that still 

00:03:11.650 --> 00:03:15.430
 I have a little bit of fear about the subject of 

00:03:13.120 --> 00:03:16.989
 the knee stability but it 

00:03:15.430 --> 00:03:21.569
 find very quiet little tired 

00:03:16.989 --> 00:03:21.569
 but I think so 

00:03:22.450 --> 00:03:28.809
 I believe that a school is being formed 

00:03:25.620 --> 00:03:28.809
 [Music] 

00:03:29.239 --> 00:03:35.920
 and I think as I say 

00:03:33.900 --> 00:03:39.540
 the champion 

00:03:35.920 --> 00:03:43.879
 [Music] 

00:03:39.540 --> 00:03:43.879
 for barcelona cup liberators 

00:03:44.400 --> 00:03:49.130
 aware of that that will continue 

00:03:46.780 --> 00:03:56.210
 as difficult and 

00:03:49.130 --> 00:03:59.540
 as this part is beginning to 

00:03:56.210 --> 00:04:08.190
 we will start to pick up the rhythm a little 

00:03:59.540 --> 00:04:10.800
 competition to get 

00:04:08.190 --> 00:04:13.350
 and always as I tell you this is a group 

00:04:10.800 --> 00:04:15.180
 healthy the time that you have to be inside 

00:04:13.350 --> 00:04:19.489
 the court you have to try to do the 

00:04:15.180 --> 00:04:19.489
 things quiet a new year 

00:04:19.549 --> 00:04:25.389
 of the championship 

00:04:22.070 --> 00:04:28.030
 last year he was left behind now 

00:04:25.389 --> 00:04:30.069
 because you have to do is think now in 

00:04:28.030 --> 00:04:33.969
 this year the present into the bag 

00:04:30.069 --> 00:04:36.160
 the best way to strengthen what I 

00:04:33.969 --> 00:04:38.440
 I passed it because 

00:04:36.160 --> 00:04:41.200
 and along with all of that well this year do 

00:04:38.440 --> 00:04:43.630
 the best thing for people firstly the 

00:04:41.200 --> 00:04:45.730
 title and then look for a championship 

00:04:43.630 --> 00:04:46.870
 international that we ask and is 

00:04:45.730 --> 00:04:48.729
 working well throughout this 

00:04:46.870 --> 00:04:51.449
 season 

00:04:48.729 --> 00:04:53.400
 and to learn it 

00:04:51.449 --> 00:04:57.809
 at the beginning of the championship and do what 

00:04:53.400 --> 00:05:01.589
 group such that there is a healthy group 

00:04:57.809 --> 00:05:02.819
 a good group and it's going to be easy with 

00:05:01.589 --> 00:05:05.479
 who had shared we raised 

00:05:02.819 --> 00:05:05.479
 team 

00:05:05.660 --> 00:05:10.490
 Luis caicedo with his books and also 

00:05:08.240 --> 00:05:12.390
 with me has raised perhaps some 

00:05:10.490 --> 00:05:15.180
 first name 

00:05:12.390 --> 00:05:17.600
 I do not think that the course of 

00:05:15.180 --> 00:05:17.600
 season
