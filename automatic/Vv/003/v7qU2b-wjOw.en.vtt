00:00:00.160 --> 00:00:06.470
 Moscow is looking at the TV Record Cartus 

00:00:06.470 --> 00:00:09.679
 not so cold all chances run over someone 

00:00:09.679 --> 00:00:11.430
 two inserted high 

00:00:11.430 --> 00:00:12.629
 dream job 

00:00:12.629 --> 00:00:15.619
 because the only crap seems strange 

00:00:15.619 --> 00:00:18.919
 that Apple is a train out of nowhere and all our friends 

00:00:18.919 --> 00:00:20.669
 Decay is 

00:00:20.669 --> 00:00:23.159
 No one has such luck 

00:00:23.159 --> 00:00:25.019
 what the media 

00:00:25.019 --> 00:00:28.730
 I think Hack Telfs gets caught too 

00:00:28.730 --> 00:00:31.730
 Scharfenberg, on the other hand, beats him 

00:00:33.360 --> 00:00:37.160
 actually a little bit early on these media no longer chic 

00:00:37.160 --> 00:00:40.260
 Kneipp office so you why women need to 

00:00:41.220 --> 00:00:44.220
 the lower one so Stone 

00:00:45.030 --> 00:00:46.760
 He also has friends 

00:00:46.760 --> 00:00:49.280
 had better but will not die 

00:00:49.280 --> 00:00:52.180
 the small troop made 

00:00:52.180 --> 00:00:54.630
 behaves in the club 

00:00:54.630 --> 00:00:58.860
 Buemi miss many passing the machine 

00:00:58.860 --> 00:01:02.020
 he is a big loss for us all » 

00:01:02.020 --> 00:01:04.580
 not just fake his skills 

00:01:04.580 --> 00:01:09.580
 to cut APA also human j successful at making it so easy 

00:01:09.580 --> 00:01:10.790
 go on 

00:01:10.790 --> 00:01:13.710
 the aviation is common in the shops 

00:01:13.710 --> 00:01:16.970
 By the way, that's the magic word 

00:01:16.970 --> 00:01:19.750
 the forgotten are each 0 4 percent 

00:01:19.750 --> 00:01:22.750
 There you only stand if you are not sure that Blizzard will win 

00:01:23.690 --> 00:01:25.830
 very tactful Miracoli 

00:01:25.830 --> 00:01:28.900
 Therefore, as Weber continues to enter she is speaking 

00:01:28.900 --> 00:01:31.340
 our appearance had absolute priority 

00:01:31.340 --> 00:01:34.620
 To do this, our heroes move on with their sorcerers and fight each other 

00:01:34.620 --> 00:01:36.539
 until the leader of the evil clocks 

00:01:36.539 --> 00:01:38.710
 Thermaltake personally 

00:01:38.710 --> 00:01:40.149
 that is the central one 

00:01:40.149 --> 00:01:43.309
 from their shoulder Patzern machines there but everywhere like that 

00:01:44.100 --> 00:01:47.580
 supposedly in years of work a method would have been found with all his 

00:01:47.580 --> 00:01:48.800
 Servant controls 

00:01:48.800 --> 00:01:50.580
 Tasci Gaal 

00:01:50.580 --> 00:01:51.890
 Brought Volvo mine 

00:01:51.890 --> 00:01:56.220
 they would have calmed down so good documenta too 

00:02:01.080 --> 00:02:04.080
 they contain 

00:02:07.530 --> 00:02:10.530
 freedom 

00:02:13.149 --> 00:02:15.859
 not convincing 

00:02:15.859 --> 00:02:19.549
 but I think, and thus a logical one with a very low intellect 

00:02:19.549 --> 00:02:22.870
 only manipulate leaders 

00:02:22.870 --> 00:02:25.870
 Euro from July lives 

00:02:26.649 --> 00:02:30.599
 important it is simple 

00:02:32.419 --> 00:02:33.250
 Stuttgart 

00:02:33.250 --> 00:02:35.509
 will be in the cereal is 

00:02:35.509 --> 00:02:37.239
 the iPad quite a lot 

00:02:37.239 --> 00:02:40.239
 Bossard says he can go on and on in Erbach 

00:02:44.909 --> 00:02:47.809
 and I need it again so high Wallenhorst 

00:02:47.809 --> 00:02:50.809
 Time 

00:02:51.689 --> 00:02:54.689
 Ariba 

00:03:11.909 --> 00:03:13.360
 HH 

00:03:13.360 --> 00:03:16.360
 HH 

00:03:18.979 --> 00:03:20.889
 so many possibilities 

00:03:20.889 --> 00:03:25.829
 Kosice she is 

00:03:28.009 --> 00:03:29.529
 me a train 

00:03:29.529 --> 00:03:31.879
 Futurecom Micaela Shepherd 

00:03:31.879 --> 00:03:35.340
 Herbert flatten them all and that's the only thing that counts for the continuous one 

00:03:35.340 --> 00:03:35.869
 with 

00:03:35.869 --> 00:03:38.299
 Vettel of course again in motion 

00:03:38.299 --> 00:03:41.549
 Bern, what's the point? Mancuso had Roosevelt 

00:03:42.129 --> 00:03:44.839
 there work should now be the collar 

00:03:44.839 --> 00:03:48.219
 called 

00:03:48.219 --> 00:03:49.519
 that's it then 

00:03:49.519 --> 00:03:53.870
 not only exaggerate 1 but also should say how should then you can great 

00:03:53.870 --> 00:03:54.580
 who belonged 

00:03:54.580 --> 00:03:57.229
 that is a lot of money 

00:03:57.229 --> 00:04:00.229
 to change more adventures 2 

00:04:01.329 --> 00:04:03.769
 I mean I want the foul, too 

00:04:03.769 --> 00:04:06.859
 I did not die before UNICEF did 

00:04:06.859 --> 00:04:08.549
 but only one goal 

00:04:08.549 --> 00:04:10.419
 something is already happening 

00:04:10.419 --> 00:04:12.519
 two hours later 

00:04:12.519 --> 00:04:15.579
 that's set in Afghanistan in half an hour 1 

00:04:15.579 --> 00:04:18.599
 So, whoever I think it's good is so outlandish that I'm dying 

00:04:19.099 --> 00:04:20.889
 «I have some ideas 

00:04:20.889 --> 00:04:23.889
 Hoeneß we head forward with no I look 

00:04:25.110 --> 00:04:27.180
 pensive 

00:04:27.180 --> 00:04:30.289
 then he could get out of here now 11 Pauli 1 1 

00:04:32.360 --> 00:04:33.270
 Frankfurt 

00:04:33.270 --> 00:04:34.529

 that will happen in the next episode of Eli Menge Vogler - ski jumping 

00:05:00.530 --> 00:05:05.440
 Of course, that's the start of the promise that more and more mistakes 

00:05:06.089 --> 00:05:07.139
 we have 

00:05:07.139 --> 00:05:10.740

00:05:11.689 --> 00:05:14.039

00:05:14.039 --> 00:05:17.589
 where Philips will suffer a terribly painful death in the next episode 

00:05:18.889 --> 00:05:21.889
 So far as I should we should not that unlikely 

00:05:22.529 --> 00:05:25.860

00:05:35.439 --> 00:05:36.830

00:05:36.830 --> 00:05:38.990
 besides, they should help 

00:05:38.990 --> 00:05:40.710
 through the stones 

00:05:40.710 --> 00:05:44.100
