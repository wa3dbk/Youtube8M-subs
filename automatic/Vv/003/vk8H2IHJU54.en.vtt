00:05:04.360 --> 00:05:05.879 
like I said on top of that hump being at
the<00:05:04.449> next<00:05:04.659> level<00:05:04.810> I<00:05:05.080> think<00:05:05.259> that<00:05:05.560> has<00:05:05.620> a<00:05:05.680> lot<00:05:05.770> to

00:05:05.879 --> 00:05:05.889 
the next level I think that has a lot to

00:05:05.889 --> 00:05:08.370 
the next level I think that has a lot to
do<00:05:06.069> with<00:05:06.099> why<00:05:06.750> wide<00:05:07.750> the<00:05:07.990> team<00:05:08.169> that<00:05:08.259> he

00:05:08.370 --> 00:05:08.380 
do with why wide the team that he

00:05:08.380 --> 00:05:10.260 
do with why wide the team that he
coached<00:05:08.620> improved<00:05:09.220> as<00:05:09.370> running<00:05:09.699> backs<00:05:09.849> well

00:05:10.260 --> 00:05:10.270 
coached improved as running backs well

00:05:10.270 --> 00:05:11.460 
coached improved as running backs well
