00:00:52.440 --> 00:00:53.660 
a bit of energy on impact and I just
want<00:00:52.590> to<00:00:52.649> see<00:00:52.829> what<00:00:52.980> I<00:00:53.010> would<00:00:53.190> do<00:00:53.309> out<00:00:53.460> of<00:00:53.489> a

00:00:53.660 --> 00:00:53.670 
want to see what I would do out of a

00:00:53.670 --> 00:00:55.580 
want to see what I would do out of a
pistol<00:00:54.180> we're<00:00:54.930> gonna<00:00:55.050> try<00:00:55.320> some<00:00:55.500> different

00:00:55.580 --> 00:00:55.590

pistol we're gonna try some different
test<00:00:55.949> out<00:00:56.129> back<00:00:56.399> and<00:00:57.120> see<00:00:57.449> how<00:00:57.510> they<00:00:57.690> perform

00:00:57.799 --> 00:00:57.809 
test out back and see how they perform

00:00:57.809 --> 00:01:00.650

00:01:02.630 --> 00:01:02.640 
you can actually see you can almost make

00:01:02.640 --> 00:01:04.700 
you can actually see you can almost make
up<00:01:02.940> to<00:01:03.059> three<00:01:03.300> segments<00:01:03.899> of<00:01:04.080> the<00:01:04.379> actual

can<00:02:27.900> we're<00:02:28.020> going<00:02:28.140> to<00:02:28.200> try<00:02:28.320> some<00:02:28.530> more<00:02:28.650> of

00:02:28.729 --> 00:02:28.739 
can we're going to try some more of

00:02:28.739 --> 00:02:31.130 
can we're going to try some more of
these<00:02:28.800> Winchester's<00:02:29.660> segments<00:02:30.660> at<00:02:30.750> rounds

00:02:31.130 --> 00:02:31.140 
these Winchester's segments at rounds

00:02:31.140 --> 00:02:32.990 
these Winchester's segments at rounds
and<00:02:31.350> I<00:02:31.590> got<00:02:31.770> a<00:02:31.800> two<00:02:32.010> liter<00:02:32.280> of<00:02:32.459> water<00:02:32.670> there

00:02:32.990 --> 00:02:33.000

00:02:33.000 --> 00:02:35.240 
and I got a two liter of water there
with<00:02:33.150> some<00:02:33.270> food<00:02:33.480> coloring<00:02:33.540> in<00:02:34.020> it<00:02:34.070> let's<00:02:35.070> just

00:02:35.240 --> 00:02:35.250 
with some food coloring in it let's just

00:02:35.250 --> 00:02:36.410 
with some food coloring in it let's just
try<00:02:35.400> to<00:02:35.430> put<00:02:35.670> one<00:02:35.700> in<00:02:35.850> there<00:02:36.060> and<00:02:36.150> see<00:02:36.270> what

00:02:36.410 --> 00:02:36.420 
try to put one in there and see what

00:02:36.420 --> 00:03:03.309 
try to put one in there and see what
happens<00:02:36.540> when<00:02:37.230> it<00:02:37.709> hits<00:02:37.830> the<00:02:38.040> two<00:02:38.790> liter

00:03:03.309 --> 00:03:03.319 

00:03:03.319 --> 00:03:05.869

very well all this sr22 pistol and I'm
very<00:03:09.299> impressed<00:03:09.569> with<00:03:09.900> the<00:03:10.140> accuracy<00:03:10.709> with

00:03:10.849 --> 00:03:10.859 
very impressed with the accuracy with

00:03:10.859 --> 00:03:12.710 
very impressed with the accuracy with
them<00:03:11.040> the<00:03:11.189> way<00:03:11.310> they<00:03:11.459> cycled<00:03:11.879> it<00:03:11.970> with<00:03:12.090> Iran<00:03:12.450> I

00:03:12.710 --> 00:03:12.720 
them the way they cycled it with Iran I

00:03:12.720 --> 00:03:14.539 
them the way they cycled it with Iran I
can't<00:03:13.290> really<00:03:13.439> tell<00:03:13.680> much<00:03:13.890> of<00:03:14.040> a<00:03:14.129> difference

00:03:14.539 --> 00:03:14.549 
can't really tell much of a difference

00:03:14.549 --> 00:03:16.250 
can't really tell much of a difference
from<00:03:14.730> the<00:03:14.879> velociter<00:03:15.420> or<00:03:15.569> whatnot<00:03:15.780> they<00:03:16.109> say

00:03:16.250 --> 00:03:16.260 
from the velociter or whatnot they say

00:03:16.260 --> 00:03:18.229 
from the velociter or whatnot they say
the<00:03:16.379> segment<00:03:16.829> around<00:03:16.920> us<00:03:17.159> when<00:03:17.250> they<00:03:17.340> hit<00:03:17.489> they

00:03:18.229 --> 00:03:18.239 
the segment around us when they hit they

00:03:18.239 --> 00:03:20.059 
the segment around us when they hit they
really<00:03:18.569> expand<00:03:18.930> but<00:03:19.200> I<00:03:19.260> really<00:03:19.560> can't<00:03:19.799> find

00:03:20.059 --> 00:03:20.069 
really expand but I really can't find

00:03:20.069 --> 00:03:21.979 
really expand but I really can't find
you<00:03:20.639> know<00:03:20.760> I<00:03:20.790> can't<00:03:21.150> really<00:03:21.299> see<00:03:21.569> that<00:03:21.780> with<00:03:21.959> a

00:03:21.979 --> 00:03:21.989 
you know I can't really see that with a

00:03:21.989 --> 00:03:24.140 
you know I can't really see that with a
stuff<00:03:22.260> I've<00:03:22.440> hit<00:03:22.650> with<00:03:22.799> a<00:03:22.829> drywall<00:03:23.430> and<00:03:23.670> the

00:03:24.140 --> 00:03:24.150 
stuff I've hit with a drywall and the

00:03:24.150 --> 00:03:25.879 
stuff I've hit with a drywall and the
plywood<00:03:24.359> and<00:03:24.870> even<00:03:25.109> the<00:03:25.200> two-liter<00:03:25.590> jug<00:03:25.859> I

00:03:25.879 --> 00:03:25.889 
plywood and even the two-liter jug I

00:03:25.889 --> 00:03:29.000 
plywood and even the two-liter jug I
really<00:03:26.250> can't<00:03:26.489> tell<00:03:26.790> so<00:03:27.480> but<00:03:28.200> anyways<00:03:28.530> I'm

really can't tell so but anyways I'm

00:03:29.010 --> 00:03:30.349 
really can't tell so but anyways I'm
gonna<00:03:29.159> try<00:03:29.400> some<00:03:29.579> different<00:03:29.819> experiments

00:03:30.349 --> 00:03:30.359 
gonna try some different experiments

00:03:30.359 --> 00:03:32.330 
gonna try some different experiments
with<00:03:30.510> these<00:03:30.629> and<00:03:31.019> I<00:03:31.470> think<00:03:31.769> I'm<00:03:31.980> gonna<00:03:32.159> run

00:03:32.330 --> 00:03:32.340 
with these and I think I'm gonna run

00:03:32.340 --> 00:03:34.849 
with these and I think I'm gonna run
them<00:03:32.459> in<00:03:32.549> my<00:03:32.670> sr22<00:03:33.450> as<00:03:33.599> a<00:03:33.629> secondary<00:03:34.109> gun<00:03:34.409> or

00:03:34.849 --> 00:03:34.859 
them in my sr22 as a secondary gun or

00:03:34.859 --> 00:03:36.949 
them in my sr22 as a secondary gun or
during<00:03:35.159> the<00:03:35.220> summer<00:03:35.370> months<00:03:35.489> just<00:03:36.359> a<00:03:36.480> primary

00:03:36.949 --> 00:03:36.959 
during the summer months just a primary

00:03:36.959 --> 00:03:39.020 
during the summer months just a primary
gun<00:03:37.170> and<00:03:37.439> this<00:03:38.250> is<00:03:38.370> a<00:03:38.400> real<00:03:38.579> nice<00:03:38.760> little

00:03:39.020 --> 00:03:39.030 
gun and this is a real nice little

00:03:39.030 --> 00:03:40.819 
gun and this is a real nice little
package<00:03:39.420> and<00:03:39.629> that's<00:03:40.349> what<00:03:40.470> I'm<00:03:40.560> gonna<00:03:40.650> go

00:03:40.819 --> 00:03:40.829 
package and that's what I'm gonna go

00:03:40.829 --> 00:03:42.199 
package and that's what I'm gonna go
with<00:03:41.040> because<00:03:41.250> I<00:03:41.400> think<00:03:41.730> it<00:03:41.879> gets<00:03:42.090> the<00:03:42.180> job

00:03:42.199 --> 00:03:42.209
