00:00:07.070 --> 00:00:09.880
 point 

00:00:17.900 --> 00:00:22.410
 good years us from grand youtube 

00:00:20.250 --> 00:00:24.510
 stroman tarraco and today we try a 

00:00:22.410 --> 00:00:28.439
 question that we have also found very 

00:00:24.510 --> 00:00:31.500
 interesting the question is how fast and 

00:00:28.439 --> 00:00:34.650
 speed are better in movements 

00:00:31.500 --> 00:00:37.560
 that is to say, the person who asked me 

00:00:34.650 --> 00:00:40.350
 wants 2 city although speed 

00:00:37.560 --> 00:00:43.500
 you have to use in movements for 

00:00:40.350 --> 00:00:45.720
 let's say it's more profitable or more 

00:00:43.500 --> 00:00:48.780
 feasible the survey looks at this 

00:00:45.720 --> 00:00:51.570
 case we want to see that I know 

00:00:48.780 --> 00:00:55.160
 just in case come but clear a lot is 

00:00:51.570 --> 00:00:55.160
 say as fast as possible 

00:00:55.510 --> 00:01:01.640
 11 sure of you are always you have to 

00:00:58.010 --> 00:01:04.190
 try to make the movement as 

00:01:01.640 --> 00:01:07.550
 fast possible 

00:01:04.190 --> 00:01:10.260
 any slowdown of the movement has 

00:01:07.550 --> 00:01:12.180
 to be given by external factors 

00:01:10.260 --> 00:01:14.730
 I do not have to thank the movement 

00:01:12.180 --> 00:01:16.860
 hamas a diet will never slow down the 

00:01:14.730 --> 00:01:18.250
 movement you have to take it 

00:01:16.860 --> 00:01:23.140
 possible 

00:01:18.250 --> 00:01:26.590
 another thing is that the weight the difficulty or 

00:01:23.140 --> 00:01:29.470
 whatever slows us down but already what 

00:01:26.590 --> 00:01:31.080
 They will slow external factors we 

00:01:29.470 --> 00:01:33.690
 do not 

00:01:31.080 --> 00:01:36.000
 for example I in the bank or in the 

00:01:33.690 --> 00:01:39.750
 squat many times they tell me no 

00:01:36.000 --> 00:01:44.430
 try to slow down but it's the feeling 

00:01:39.750 --> 00:01:47.340
 of controlling the weight with expressed no 

00:01:44.430 --> 00:01:50.520
 we can create the chest makes you the 

00:01:47.340 --> 00:01:53.350
 bar the chest or can not I under the most 

00:01:50.520 --> 00:01:56.259
 fast I can 

00:01:53.350 --> 00:01:57.900
 in fact many times climb fast and 

00:01:56.259 --> 00:02:00.360
 down 

00:01:57.900 --> 00:02:02.970
 because I have mastered the movement and 

00:02:00.360 --> 00:02:05.430
 when I earlier the fastest the most 

00:02:02.970 --> 00:02:06.930
 proximity has to be from the 

00:02:05.430 --> 00:02:10.590
 Secretary of the same thing goes down 

00:02:06.930 --> 00:02:12.570
 going down going down we have left and when 

00:02:10.590 --> 00:02:15.690
 she does not touch more to the following except 

00:02:12.570 --> 00:02:17.850
 with all the maximum power that 

00:02:15.690 --> 00:02:19.270
 have to give you maximum speed 

00:02:17.850 --> 00:02:21.370
 possible 

00:02:19.270 --> 00:02:24.280
 change in the deadlift as I already have 

00:02:21.370 --> 00:02:26.500
 I only have one phase that I do not have to 

00:02:24.280 --> 00:02:29.380
 make a phase of descent all there is more 

00:02:26.500 --> 00:02:32.280
 explosive in the deadlift the same as 

00:02:29.380 --> 00:02:34.810
 if you have to throw explosive start 

00:02:32.280 --> 00:02:38.380
 point if then the movement will 

00:02:34.810 --> 00:02:41.650
 slows down that it's because of the weight 

00:02:38.380 --> 00:02:45.190
 difficulty for what it costs but never 

00:02:41.650 --> 00:02:48.640
 want to slow us down 

00:02:45.190 --> 00:02:50.740
 everything to the strength phase we 

00:02:48.640 --> 00:02:52.450
 the genera according to their vice-weight in 

00:02:50.740 --> 00:02:56.260
 squat and for example bench press 

00:02:52.450 --> 00:03:00.850
 you realize that for example 200000 

00:02:56.260 --> 00:03:02.790
 kilos can not be thrown in a paper is 

00:03:00.850 --> 00:03:06.160
 the control and less when there is stop 

00:03:02.790 --> 00:03:08.530
 first the most risk of injury and 

00:03:06.160 --> 00:03:10.930
 second you lose control of it 

00:03:08.530 --> 00:03:13.630
 weight one you're lost weight control 

00:03:10.930 --> 00:03:16.150
 you no longer recover , therefore I am under 

00:03:13.630 --> 00:03:18.100
 as fast as I can three as much 

00:03:16.150 --> 00:03:20.980
 fast that I can get off controlling 

00:03:18.100 --> 00:03:24.160
 once they support the chest and I love 

00:03:20.980 --> 00:03:26.739
 the press as hard if I go further 

00:03:24.160 --> 00:03:29.860
 not for now it's not because I want to 

00:03:26.739 --> 00:03:31.360
 I want to go up to 200 per hour but the weight 

00:03:29.860 --> 00:03:33.880
 it does not let me 

00:03:31.360 --> 00:03:35.330
 as you want to see that has not 

00:03:33.880 --> 00:03:39.080
 slowed down 

00:03:35.330 --> 00:03:42.170
 we leave to go up to 300 and then 

00:03:39.080 --> 00:03:44.870
 getting on one is a matter of weight the advance 

00:03:42.170 --> 00:03:47.770
 in would accept the same thing go down on 

00:03:44.870 --> 00:03:50.120
 everything controlling slow and calm 

00:03:47.770 --> 00:03:52.520
 because a very heavy sentence in the 

00:03:50.120 --> 00:03:55.790
 moment that you do not control or want to do 

00:03:52.520 --> 00:03:58.100
 a bounce down too strong you can 

00:03:55.790 --> 00:04:01.070
 to strike the balance between 

00:03:58.100 --> 00:04:04.220
 for the sides it goes down rather slow 

00:04:01.070 --> 00:04:07.280
 controlling slow not all airplanes 

00:04:04.220 --> 00:04:09.290
 you can download but usually to eyes of 

00:04:07.280 --> 00:04:11.210
 the people is the electro work is the 

00:04:09.290 --> 00:04:13.880
 fast host where slow progress of 

00:04:11.210 --> 00:04:16.510
 he pointed the tours the cogote the 300 to see 

00:04:13.880 --> 00:04:20.239
 how low and above all how it goes up 

00:04:16.510 --> 00:04:21.830
 then once you do not have to turn it off 

00:04:20.239 --> 00:04:24.200
 This protects the squat is good 

00:04:21.830 --> 00:04:30.480
 go out with everything 

00:04:24.200 --> 00:04:32.520
 one many times faster 

00:04:30.480 --> 00:04:34.529
 pressure tempted to rise as fast as 

00:04:32.520 --> 00:04:37.150
 may l 

00:04:34.529 --> 00:04:41.050
 and the deadlift the same 

00:04:37.150 --> 00:04:44.820
 straight back to have strong as a 

00:04:41.050 --> 00:04:47.130
 red top view and throw with everything 

00:04:44.820 --> 00:04:50.820
 because that city is close to everyone and 

00:04:47.130 --> 00:04:54.750
 with 6 give enough speed to the 

00:04:50.820 --> 00:04:57.090
 exit you probably have the option 

00:04:54.750 --> 00:04:59.900
 to raise some weight that coming out more 

00:04:57.090 --> 00:04:59.900
 slow it would not go up 

00:05:00.409 --> 00:05:04.779
 agree about all the dead prisoner 

00:05:02.569 --> 00:05:07.519
 who does not have a phase of descent 

00:05:04.779 --> 00:05:09.739
 you already throw up with everything 

00:05:07.519 --> 00:05:11.929
 since beginning there is not a phase of 

00:05:09.739 --> 00:05:13.489
 controlled nothing therefore I tried 

00:05:11.929 --> 00:05:17.029
 speak the maximum possible speed 

00:05:13.489 --> 00:05:19.519
 then already external factors such as 

00:05:17.029 --> 00:05:21.709
 gravity 9.8 are those that will dictate 

00:05:19.519 --> 00:05:24.289
 your final speed but you 

00:05:21.709 --> 00:05:26.539
 give it all you can always and 

00:05:24.289 --> 00:05:29.989
 when the technique is maintained not at 

00:05:26.539 --> 00:05:31.699
 crazy and as they go increasing weight os 

00:05:29.989 --> 00:05:35.149
 you will notice that the phases of descent 

00:05:31.699 --> 00:05:38.479
 they are slower but not for nothing but 

00:05:35.149 --> 00:05:40.969
 look for a weight point and let's say that 

00:05:38.479 --> 00:05:44.119
 that press or that break in the 

00:05:40.969 --> 00:05:47.629
 parallel frees you to go out with a 

00:05:44.119 --> 00:05:51.559
 up and that is the moment 

00:05:47.629 --> 00:05:53.929
 that you have to create the 

00:05:51.559 --> 00:05:56.539
 maximum possibility then already said 

00:05:53.929 --> 00:05:59.269
 between gravity the weight 

00:05:56.539 --> 00:06:01.669
 muscle tremor and other psuv and deis 

00:05:59.269 --> 00:06:03.350
 to grace that you can but you 

00:06:01.669 --> 00:06:06.080
 always the maximum 

00:06:03.350 --> 00:06:07.910
 therefore what speed and speed are 

00:06:06.080 --> 00:06:10.310
 best in the movements of the phases 

00:06:07.910 --> 00:06:13.640
 concentric eccentric to death in 

00:06:10.310 --> 00:06:16.730
 life as fast as you can then 

00:06:13.640 --> 00:06:18.230
 external good external factors and 

00:06:16.730 --> 00:06:20.390
 also tender as the weight you have 

00:06:18.230 --> 00:06:22.070
 above are those who will dictate the 

00:06:20.390 --> 00:06:24.260
 final speed but you do not 

00:06:22.070 --> 00:06:26.180
 try to download it by yourself to 

00:06:24.260 --> 00:06:29.510
 three hundred always if there was not getting on 

00:06:26.180 --> 00:06:32.380
 one better but if you want to go up to 150 already 

00:06:29.510 --> 00:06:35.260
 not going up is still you know that given 

00:06:32.380 --> 00:06:37.600
 okay then this is a video 

00:06:35.260 --> 00:06:40.270
 that you do not have to go around this anymore 

00:06:37.600 --> 00:06:43.570
 maximum speed plus more possibility 

00:06:40.270 --> 00:06:46.510
 maximum power and then everything else 

00:06:43.570 --> 00:06:48.820
 is what will determine how much your 

00:06:46.510 --> 00:06:51.850
 look many times you see a video uploaded 

00:06:48.820 --> 00:06:54.400
 but if you feel the video part 

00:06:51.850 --> 00:06:56.830
 it adds up faster and it's because the 

00:06:54.400 --> 00:06:59.080
 Feeling has to be getting out the most 

00:06:56.830 --> 00:07:01.150
 possible fast down there or wash it 

00:06:59.080 --> 00:07:03.580
 the chest or the floor bar then 

00:07:01.150 --> 00:07:06.310
 many times I do them and then you 

00:07:03.580 --> 00:07:08.890
 you're stuck but in the end it goes up and up 

00:07:06.310 --> 00:07:10.660
 it's because you've wanted to come out to me if 

00:07:08.890 --> 00:07:14.320
 you want to know what I think about it to see 

00:07:10.660 --> 00:07:16.090
 he tempered it he tempered and arranged it 

00:07:14.320 --> 00:07:17.710
 agreement that is to say that maximum power 

00:07:16.090 --> 00:07:21.310
 teacher is possibility of maximum 

00:07:17.710 --> 00:07:22.930
 speed then if there is no speed 

00:07:21.310 --> 00:07:25.420
 blame for the factors that we have 

00:07:22.930 --> 00:07:28.480
 commented not because of your fault of 

00:07:25.420 --> 00:07:30.390
 agreement always in force surveys 

00:07:28.480 --> 00:07:32.270
 maximum and power 

00:07:30.390 --> 00:07:36.150
 another totally different story 

00:07:32.270 --> 00:07:38.880
 hypertrophies and also here we answer 

00:07:36.150 --> 00:07:40.440
 pure uprisings of powers of 

00:07:38.880 --> 00:07:42.480
 Ok, well, let's hope we have 

00:07:40.440 --> 00:07:43.920
 finish of the term if there is any doubt 

00:07:42.480 --> 00:07:47.460
 more like us you always lay it 

00:07:43.920 --> 00:07:48.900
 comments on the channel and as always if 

00:07:47.460 --> 00:07:51.500
 you want new in next lines 

00:07:48.900 --> 00:07:51.500
 many thanks 

00:07:58.210 --> 00:08:00.960
 good
