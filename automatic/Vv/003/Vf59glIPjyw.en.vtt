00:04:46.170 --> 00:04:46.180 
was overwritten let's say for example

00:04:46.180 --> 00:04:49.920

you<00:04:46.919> erased<00:04:47.919> your<00:04:48.220> hard<00:04:48.490> drive<00:04:48.820> and<00:04:49.240> reinstall

you erased your hard drive and reinstall

00:04:49.930 --> 00:04:51.749 
you erased your hard drive and reinstall
the<00:04:50.139> OS<00:04:50.500> and<00:04:50.530> you're<00:04:50.860> trying<00:04:51.100> to<00:04:51.220> recover<00:04:51.490> the

00:04:51.749 --> 00:04:51.759

00:04:54.400 --> 00:04:57.330 
data that was there previously that's
when<00:04:54.639> you<00:04:54.759> will<00:04:54.910> run<00:04:55.180> a<00:04:55.509> deep<00:04:55.960> scan<00:04:56.289> a<00:04:56.590> deleted

when you will run a deep scan a deleted
file<00:04:57.639> scan<00:04:58.030> would<00:04:58.330> be<00:04:58.600> for<00:04:59.110> files<00:04:59.710> that<00:05:00.009> were
