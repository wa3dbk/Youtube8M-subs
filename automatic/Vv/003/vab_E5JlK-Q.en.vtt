00:00:00.689 --> 00:00:05.320
 hello to everyone who watches me follow 

00:00:03.190 --> 00:00:07.750
 Hello everyone in general video about magic 

00:00:05.320 --> 00:00:09.789
 magnets as you remember in the past video 

00:00:07.750 --> 00:00:12.009
 I refueled to 50 liters of gas 

00:00:09.789 --> 00:00:15.219
 refueling and decided to see how much would 

00:00:12.009 --> 00:00:17.530
 how much fuel will I drive in the city 

00:00:15.219 --> 00:00:19.900
 cycle how much I will burn the fuel in the city 

00:00:17.530 --> 00:00:21.730
 more less I will spend the distance well 

00:00:19.900 --> 00:00:24.580
 in general, I do not remember how much was consumption 

00:00:21.730 --> 00:00:27.460
 the expense was a little big dumb i 

00:00:24.580 --> 00:00:31.000
 usually even less in expenditure but in this 

00:00:27.460 --> 00:00:34.060
 I donâ€™t want a moment to be honest 

00:00:31.000 --> 00:00:36.220
 put pressure on the gas and maybe I could 

00:00:34.060 --> 00:00:39.850
 drive more but I got on 

00:00:36.220 --> 00:00:42.400
 50 liters of gasoline I drove 621 kilometers 

00:00:39.850 --> 00:00:44.860
 here was on this fuel scale was 

00:00:42.400 --> 00:00:47.500
 two squares the computer showed here 

00:00:44.860 --> 00:00:49.180
 what is left is fuel for 50 kilometers in 

00:00:47.500 --> 00:00:51.520
 overall it was all k last time I 

00:00:49.180 --> 00:00:54.010
 specifically noted that it will be in this 

00:00:51.520 --> 00:00:55.809
 moment to tell you about it my not 

00:00:54.010 --> 00:00:58.390
 my opinion to be honest about it 

00:00:55.809 --> 00:01:00.460
 magnetum well complete nonsense of course I still 

00:00:58.390 --> 00:01:04.650
 I will try it I disassembled yet 

00:01:00.460 --> 00:01:07.330
 hard drives and I probably have about 

00:01:04.650 --> 00:01:09.040
 10-15 magnets I still have them on top 

00:01:07.330 --> 00:01:11.560
 just add to these purely for interest 

00:01:09.040 --> 00:01:12.490
 maybe we will increase the magnetic field but it 

00:01:11.560 --> 00:01:14.229
 complete nonsense 

00:01:12.490 --> 00:01:16.350
 anyway gasoline will not be some 

00:01:14.229 --> 00:01:19.270
 magical and will not ignite and 

00:01:16.350 --> 00:01:21.070
 allocate 3 times more energy that 

00:01:19.270 --> 00:01:23.380
 of course there will be no magic 

00:01:21.070 --> 00:01:25.840
 so maybe someone tried 

00:01:23.380 --> 00:01:28.030
 tell the guys comments leave 

00:01:25.840 --> 00:01:30.369
 write that maybe someone has already put 

00:01:28.030 --> 00:01:33.659
 after my first videos what feelings 

00:01:30.369 --> 00:01:37.119
 maybe there is someone increase 

00:01:33.659 --> 00:01:41.380
 horses still something in general like that 

00:01:37.119 --> 00:01:43.900
 so here I will try to test further 

00:01:41.380 --> 00:01:47.200
 Again you will tell as vidyashku 

00:01:43.900 --> 00:01:48.759
 that is, everything is actually in general all 

00:01:47.200 --> 00:01:50.950
 thanks who watched from me 

00:01:48.759 --> 00:01:53.229
 minimizing so tell doing 

00:01:50.950 --> 00:01:55.390
 Chandelier like LED on the roof know 

00:01:53.229 --> 00:01:58.119
 such a length is set only homemade 

00:01:55.390 --> 00:02:00.759
 do we do what we have 

00:01:58.119 --> 00:02:02.560
 led some remained but 

00:02:00.759 --> 00:02:04.180
 one wad us 3 well, in general, is not the point 

00:02:02.560 --> 00:02:09.340
 I made you a vidyashku show 

00:02:04.180 --> 00:02:11.620
 doing for an SUV 

00:02:09.340 --> 00:02:14.069
 watch it will be interesting thank you all 

00:02:11.620 --> 00:02:14.069
 bye Bye
