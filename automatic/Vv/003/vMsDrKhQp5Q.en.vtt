00:00:00.740 --> 00:00:06.660
 so hello today which we 

00:00:03.419 --> 00:00:09.450
 are going to make farm cheese from 

00:00:06.660 --> 00:00:11.820
 month I became at home or goat 

00:00:09.450 --> 00:00:15.540
 as you want for that you have 

00:00:11.820 --> 00:00:17.609
 need a salad bowl a liter of milk 

00:00:15.540 --> 00:00:19.350
 integer then I specify integer because 

00:00:17.609 --> 00:00:21.720
 it's still better than 2000 to cream 

00:00:19.350 --> 00:00:23.730
 so either you take it to the farm 

00:00:21.720 --> 00:00:25.289
 then whole cows or 

00:00:23.730 --> 00:00:27.810
 goat workshops if you want to do 

00:00:25.289 --> 00:00:29.340
 sometimes I goat or you can too 

00:00:27.810 --> 00:00:31.109
 also bought a milk carton 

00:00:29.340 --> 00:00:32.099
 whole cow's cheese and in the 

00:00:31.109 --> 00:00:35.489
 trade 

00:00:32.099 --> 00:00:37.170
 then you need a natural yogurt where 

00:00:35.489 --> 00:00:41.550
 you can replace with two small ones 

00:00:37.170 --> 00:00:43.170
 Swiss mold type molds 

00:00:41.550 --> 00:00:44.430
 do those found in the 

00:00:43.170 --> 00:00:46.230
 trade where you buy a spanking 

00:00:44.430 --> 00:00:50.520
 will you keep the mold that owes its 

00:00:46.230 --> 00:00:53.190
 cdc cheeses from professionals s and 

00:00:50.520 --> 00:00:55.410
 cheeses for small and cabÃ©cou 

00:00:53.190 --> 00:00:57.090
 we also need the 

00:00:55.410 --> 00:01:00.149
 rennet that you can buy a 

00:00:57.090 --> 00:01:03.899
 format 6 so it costs 4 or 5 euros and 

00:01:00.149 --> 00:01:05.610
 with that makes you pretty much crazy about 

00:01:03.899 --> 00:01:07.799
 prefers it's hundreds and hundreds 

00:01:05.610 --> 00:01:10.020
 of cheese that's about four or 

00:01:07.799 --> 00:01:13.650
 five drops for rennet for just about 

00:01:10.020 --> 00:01:18.210
 near a liter of milk so there I 

00:01:13.650 --> 00:01:25.259
 deposited yoghurt so nature in the 

00:01:18.210 --> 00:01:26.520
 salad bowl and so next to that after 

00:01:25.259 --> 00:01:27.000
 have deposited your nature of 

00:01:26.520 --> 00:01:29.640
 the burnt 

00:01:27.000 --> 00:01:31.829
 I heat the milk so at about 

00:01:29.640 --> 00:01:33.930
 near thirty degrees so 

00:01:31.829 --> 00:01:37.259
 knowing that the temperature it is already at 

00:01:33.930 --> 00:01:40.970
 20 degrees room temperature there 

00:01:37.259 --> 00:01:40.970
 it's barely a minute or two 

00:01:41.030 --> 00:01:45.350
 so after heating the milk 

00:01:52.430 --> 00:02:00.910
 I am going to incorporate a little bit of milk 

00:01:56.510 --> 00:02:05.210
 so in the salad bowl and I'm going 

00:02:00.910 --> 00:02:06.920
 mix with the plain yoghurt and 

00:02:05.210 --> 00:02:09.380
 then after that I'll leave to rest 

00:02:06.920 --> 00:02:11.570
 about two hours and at the end of the two 

00:02:09.380 --> 00:02:13.690
 hours games reincorporate the entire 

00:02:11.570 --> 00:02:13.690
 milk 

00:02:16.190 --> 00:02:22.870
 so there after eight minutes thirty 

00:02:18.170 --> 00:02:31.010
 the milk is about thirty degrees 

00:02:22.870 --> 00:02:35.570
 people are mixing a part with the 

00:02:31.010 --> 00:02:45.230
 yogurt is there but I put there I the 

00:02:35.570 --> 00:02:47.830
 milk yogurt what I want to win I 

00:02:45.230 --> 00:02:47.830
 m outdoors 

00:03:05.530 --> 00:03:11.870
 and there now I will let rest 

00:03:07.970 --> 00:03:13.730
 about two hours so here are two 

00:03:11.870 --> 00:03:16.060
 hours after 

00:03:13.730 --> 00:03:18.680
 so we have our yogurt mix so 

00:03:16.060 --> 00:03:23.270
 with a little bit of milk so there I 

00:03:18.680 --> 00:03:26.650
 will pour the remaining milk you 

00:03:23.270 --> 00:03:26.650
 see already it starts to solidify 

00:03:28.209 --> 00:03:48.680
 it starts we can not say a little to 

00:03:31.010 --> 00:03:51.489
 kayes is here so I came back and I 

00:03:48.680 --> 00:03:54.530
 so go pour the pressure 

00:03:51.489 --> 00:03:57.290
 so see three finals against me I 

00:03:54.530 --> 00:04:07.239
 say 3 4 drops of rennet per liter 

00:03:57.290 --> 00:04:10.430
 of milk 4 I will put five months 

00:04:07.239 --> 00:04:13.250
 even if it's because so part 

00:04:10.430 --> 00:04:15.110
 moment when you open it after and so 

00:04:13.250 --> 00:04:17.299
 after we shake is left when 

00:04:15.110 --> 00:04:19.160
 you open it it's less strong after 

00:04:17.299 --> 00:04:27.860
 christian you can add a 

00:04:19.160 --> 00:04:30.020
 ladle or two more and there what I 

00:04:27.860 --> 00:04:31.430
 I'm going to do is after I'm going 

00:04:30.020 --> 00:04:37.070
 let it sit and I'll cover 

00:04:31.430 --> 00:04:38.479
 of praise in about 24 hours the 

00:04:37.070 --> 00:04:41.050
 time that the notebook is formed at the 

00:04:38.479 --> 00:04:41.050
 nose surface 

00:04:42.229 --> 00:04:47.570
 so that's after 24 hours the 

00:04:45.080 --> 00:04:50.750
 learned rennet you notice that so 

00:04:47.570 --> 00:04:52.340
 we have a little milk the whey is this 

00:04:50.750 --> 00:04:55.990
 so called who was formed so at the 

00:04:52.340 --> 00:05:00.630
 surface so cheese the curdled milk 

00:04:55.990 --> 00:05:05.900
 is now so we will be able to m 

00:05:00.630 --> 00:05:05.900
 the notebook then in the mills 

00:05:11.390 --> 00:05:29.930
 so that the whey is cool so 

00:05:16.670 --> 00:05:36.260
 delicately through the holes so we'll see 

00:05:29.930 --> 00:05:40.790
 subsequently that actually the 

00:05:36.260 --> 00:05:51.800
 cheese will harden from here 

00:05:40.790 --> 00:05:53.930
 other days and so we will put that the 

00:05:51.800 --> 00:05:56.920
 cheese on a little more makes consequent 

00:05:53.930 --> 00:05:56.920
 will start salting 

00:06:19.070 --> 00:06:25.280
 so with a liter of milk I made 

00:06:21.660 --> 00:06:28.590
 about five cheeses that will reduce 

00:06:25.280 --> 00:06:32.070
 so here we go we'll wait we'll 

00:06:28.590 --> 00:06:34.500
 cover a little bit and in two or 

00:06:32.070 --> 00:06:36.840
 three days when the whey will be 

00:06:34.500 --> 00:06:38.640
 do I mostly do a wadi 1 2 on 

00:06:36.840 --> 00:06:40.500
 told me we'll start with room and a 

00:06:38.640 --> 00:06:42.060
 face then after when the cheese 

00:06:40.500 --> 00:06:46.560
 will begin to take the consistency we do not 

00:06:42.060 --> 00:06:51.420
 will return so here is after 24 

00:06:46.560 --> 00:06:58.230
 hours the whey evacuated I 

00:06:51.420 --> 00:07:06.090
 so salty but cheese on one side I 

00:06:58.230 --> 00:07:10.470
 have them back there you can see the 

00:07:06.090 --> 00:07:15.120
 cheese but there is still little 

00:07:10.470 --> 00:07:22.530
 milk so we'll leave it again that's 

00:07:15.120 --> 00:07:25.880
 taste for 24 hours at the end on and 

00:07:22.530 --> 00:07:30.360
 will come out of the molds and we will put them 

00:07:25.880 --> 00:07:32.910
 under a bell for the final during 

00:07:30.360 --> 00:07:36.810
 again we will say three four days 

00:07:32.910 --> 00:07:37.140
 before consuming so you can 

00:07:36.810 --> 00:07:39.300
 do it 

00:07:37.140 --> 00:07:40.890
 so that's cheese dung from 

00:07:39.300 --> 00:07:42.900
 Cow relay but you can 

00:07:40.890 --> 00:07:44.100
 also if you use a movie tale 

00:07:42.900 --> 00:07:45.720
 goat milk you will have 

00:07:44.100 --> 00:07:48.960
 goat cheese is simply 

00:07:45.720 --> 00:07:51.570
 so after you can when they are a 

00:07:48.960 --> 00:07:55.050
 not so fresh that's where you 

00:07:51.570 --> 00:07:56.220
 can put db2 pepper or berries 

00:07:55.050 --> 00:07:58.970
 reds did what you want for 

00:07:56.220 --> 00:07:58.970
 to decorate what
