00:00:02.270 --> 00:00:06.380
 completely abandoned there are some 

00:00:04.040 --> 00:00:08.510
 years this object in the middle of mans 

00:00:06.380 --> 00:00:10.430
 found a second life through a 

00:00:08.510 --> 00:00:11.810
 couple of teachers 

00:00:10.430 --> 00:00:13.760
 to carry out their work of 

00:00:11.810 --> 00:00:17.260
 renovation they called upon 

00:00:13.760 --> 00:00:17.260
 the architect Michel roinÃ© 

00:00:17.380 --> 00:00:22.390
 the owners bought the house 

00:00:19.179 --> 00:00:24.489
 in 2007 and she was in very bad 

00:00:22.390 --> 00:00:26.019
 state she was almost more livable 

00:00:24.489 --> 00:00:28.119
 so there was a building body 

00:00:26.019 --> 00:00:30.939
 with the two- slope roof that we have 

00:00:28.119 --> 00:00:32.469
 kept it was removed the coating for 

00:00:30.939 --> 00:00:34.480
 make rubble masonry 

00:00:32.469 --> 00:00:36.339
 apparent of the guard who stops a small 

00:00:34.480 --> 00:00:37.600
 that old and as she was 

00:00:36.339 --> 00:00:40.089
 insufficiently large 

00:00:37.600 --> 00:00:41.379
 we added a wing and so we have to 

00:00:40.089 --> 00:00:43.210
 give a little character more 

00:00:41.379 --> 00:00:45.309
 contemporary so as to play a little 

00:00:43.210 --> 00:00:47.610
 little on both volumes and on both 

00:00:45.309 --> 00:00:47.610
 styles 

00:00:49.060 --> 00:00:53.130
 this old building body featured 

00:00:50.980 --> 00:00:55.180
 before five pieces were entirely 

00:00:53.130 --> 00:00:58.210
 decompartmentalize game but have them 

00:00:55.180 --> 00:01:00.990
 enjoyed a great stay of the ambient 

00:00:58.210 --> 00:01:00.990
 70 square meters 

00:01:01.990 --> 00:01:06.850
 the solid facts of the 

00:01:05.200 --> 00:01:09.910
 apparent floor 

00:01:06.850 --> 00:01:12.280
 on the other hand we have decompartmentalised the pieces 

00:01:09.910 --> 00:01:14.470
 we are at an open volume and a kitchen 

00:01:12.280 --> 00:01:16.090
 integrated on this site 

00:01:14.470 --> 00:01:18.070
 Michel Moynier worked in 

00:01:16.090 --> 00:01:19.840
 collaboration with the craftsman Julian 

00:01:18.070 --> 00:01:22.240
 lazennec one of their concerns 

00:01:19.840 --> 00:01:25.680
 main was two wheels you the 

00:01:22.240 --> 00:01:25.680
 energy efficient building 

00:01:26.380 --> 00:01:32.520
 the difficulty of this project it has 

00:01:28.660 --> 00:01:35.410
 was to combine modern comfort in 

00:01:32.520 --> 00:01:37.600
 keeping all the aesthetics of the house 

00:01:35.410 --> 00:01:40.470
 old and still having a 

00:01:37.600 --> 00:01:44.170
 house that is not too energy intensive 

00:01:40.470 --> 00:01:47.229
 we favored large openings 

00:01:44.170 --> 00:01:49.600
 to the south to let in a maximum of 

00:01:47.229 --> 00:01:52.330
 light and also benefit from the 

00:01:49.600 --> 00:01:55.210
 sweet heat of the sun the north side to 

00:01:52.330 --> 00:01:57.780
 reinforced insulation with very little 

00:01:55.210 --> 00:01:57.780
 opening 

00:01:58.710 --> 00:02:06.960
 we have here a double glazing consequent to 

00:02:02.470 --> 00:02:06.960
 low emissivity filled with gaza 

00:02:09.479 --> 00:02:15.030
 the walls that does not fit with 

00:02:13.050 --> 00:02:18.659
 outside parties we could keep them 

00:02:15.030 --> 00:02:20.819
 in stone have the charm of the ancient 

00:02:18.659 --> 00:02:23.250
 outside parties have 

00:02:20.819 --> 00:02:28.860
 benefited from wool insulation 

00:02:23.250 --> 00:02:30.930
 12 cm glass and layer roofing 

00:02:28.860 --> 00:02:34.230
 of crossed glass wool with a total 

00:02:30.930 --> 00:02:35.579
 of 300 mm the extension was made to 

00:02:34.230 --> 00:02:37.590
 from an andric base and a 

00:02:35.579 --> 00:02:41.069
 wooden frame isolated from the outside 

00:02:37.590 --> 00:02:43.590
 with 145 mm of rock wool is doubled 

00:02:41.069 --> 00:02:45.629
 from the inside with 100 mm wool 

00:02:43.590 --> 00:02:47.090
 glass and a waterproofing membrane to 

00:02:45.629 --> 00:02:49.260
 the air 

00:02:47.090 --> 00:02:51.959
 products used for insulation 

00:02:49.260 --> 00:02:53.670
 are all certified acermi what the 

00:02:51.959 --> 00:02:56.010
 makes it eligible for the tax credit 

00:02:53.670 --> 00:02:58.709
 ventilation is provided by a vmc 

00:02:56.010 --> 00:03:01.680
 simple flow and heating side a 

00:02:58.709 --> 00:03:03.540
 bi energy solution that selects for 

00:03:01.680 --> 00:03:06.930
 the heating we oriented ourselves 

00:03:03.540 --> 00:03:09.870
 on a heat pump air water with a 

00:03:06.930 --> 00:03:12.299
 stove certified nf in addition to 

00:03:09.870 --> 00:03:13.950
 heating the air / water heat pump 

00:03:12.299 --> 00:03:16.079
 feeds on one side a water balloon 

00:03:13.950 --> 00:03:17.790
 hot and on the other side a heater 

00:03:16.079 --> 00:03:19.560
 on the ground floor and 

00:03:17.790 --> 00:03:21.389
 radiators on the floors 

00:03:19.560 --> 00:03:22.769
 the owners decided to install 

00:03:21.389 --> 00:03:24.989
 a stove 

00:03:22.769 --> 00:03:27.870
 which allows the mid-season to delay 

00:03:24.989 --> 00:03:29.790
 a little start the heating and in 

00:03:27.870 --> 00:03:32.040
 winter the hair having a strong radiation 

00:03:29.790 --> 00:03:34.739
 it helps to heat up this large volume 

00:03:32.040 --> 00:03:37.260
 to prevent the probes from overheating 

00:03:34.739 --> 00:03:39.090
 exterior and interior just put 

00:03:37.260 --> 00:03:40.769
 the heat pump on standby when the 

00:03:39.090 --> 00:03:43.760
 temperature set on the clock of 

00:03:40.769 --> 00:03:46.670
 programming is achieved 

00:03:43.760 --> 00:03:48.950
 in the end we realize that these two 

00:03:46.670 --> 00:03:51.230
 energies cohabit very well since 

00:03:48.950 --> 00:03:53.780
 homeowners use less than one 

00:03:51.230 --> 00:03:55.909
 half an hour of wood per year and have a 

00:03:53.780 --> 00:03:57.439
 electricity bill less than 200 

00:03:55.909 --> 00:04:03.829
 euros for a house three hundred meters 

00:03:57.439 --> 00:04:05.750
 habitable squares and if one stairs 

00:04:03.829 --> 00:04:08.239
 which leads to the mezzanine we wanted 

00:04:05.750 --> 00:04:09.980
 in a fairly light style so with 

00:04:08.239 --> 00:04:13.519
 contemporary wood-based materials 

00:04:09.980 --> 00:04:15.019
 is in contrast to the frame 

00:04:13.519 --> 00:04:16.549
 apparent who is the most charming 

00:04:15.019 --> 00:04:18.590
 original which has been completely renovated 

00:04:16.549 --> 00:04:20.930
 and underneath we put a railing 

00:04:18.590 --> 00:04:23.060
 contemporary to avoid falls 

00:04:20.930 --> 00:04:25.130
 a little in the strict the frame we have 

00:04:23.060 --> 00:04:28.370
 concerned a half-timbered gable which 

00:04:25.130 --> 00:04:31.010
 was existing to separate so a 

00:04:28.370 --> 00:04:34.000
 independent room for friends or 

00:04:31.010 --> 00:04:34.000
 the big kids 

00:04:35.889 --> 00:04:41.740
 we are now moving towards 

00:04:37.780 --> 00:04:44.379
 the extension that was created we have 

00:04:41.740 --> 00:04:46.830
 does this piece with a roof 

00:04:44.379 --> 00:04:49.449
 terrace place so as to be able 

00:04:46.830 --> 00:04:50.680
 connect the two roofs the part 

00:04:49.449 --> 00:04:51.909
 old part of the new part without 

00:04:50.680 --> 00:04:54.460
 particular problem 

00:04:51.909 --> 00:04:56.229
 this piece she made garden office 

00:04:54.460 --> 00:04:58.060
 in winter it is largely open to 

00:04:56.229 --> 00:05:00.430
 the outdoor terrace to make room 

00:04:58.060 --> 00:05:03.279
 to eat summer and she leads to 

00:05:00.430 --> 00:05:05.499
 December the parental suite 

00:05:03.279 --> 00:05:08.129
 a large desk and a bedroom for 

00:05:05.499 --> 00:05:08.129
 grandchildren we 

00:05:08.800 --> 00:05:12.460
 with a cost of 1400 euros per meter 

00:05:11.169 --> 00:05:14.830
 square for renovation 

00:05:12.460 --> 00:05:16.930
 this house today spacious and 

00:05:14.830 --> 00:05:18.819
 doubly well heated allow these 

00:05:16.930 --> 00:05:20.919
 owners to see comfortably 

00:05:18.819 --> 00:05:23.520
 spent the seasons without burning their 

00:05:20.919 --> 00:05:23.520
 savings
