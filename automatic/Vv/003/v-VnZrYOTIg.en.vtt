00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.790
 his fingers all here and computers one 

00:00:01.740 --> 00:00:05.819
 find new videos 

00:00:02.790 --> 00:00:07.470
 for special tips executed so 

00:00:05.819 --> 00:00:09.840
 right away the first tip that 

00:00:07.470 --> 00:00:12.179
 regards their shortcuts to executed 

00:00:09.840 --> 00:00:14.429
 so instead of going to search done 

00:00:12.179 --> 00:00:16.949
 simply windows + r and you have the 

00:00:14.429 --> 00:00:18.810
 execution window so you have 

00:00:16.949 --> 00:00:20.310
 makes an image capture to show that 

00:00:18.810 --> 00:00:22.650
 does it hit run windows 

00:00:20.310 --> 00:00:25.710
 this is the one fact that you and backbreaking 

00:00:22.650 --> 00:00:28.800
 open them run for number tips 

00:00:25.710 --> 00:00:30.480
 two posters between go so you 

00:00:28.800 --> 00:00:31.650
 open your executed it's always 

00:00:30.480 --> 00:00:33.149
 helpful when you're in a 

00:00:31.650 --> 00:00:34.530
 library and you have no keyboard 

00:00:33.149 --> 00:00:36.329
 you type to the survivors 

00:00:34.530 --> 00:00:40.050
 you wait a little bit and there a 

00:00:36.329 --> 00:00:43.410
 keyboard appears now 

00:00:40.050 --> 00:00:48.300
 trick number 3 which concerns the table 

00:00:43.410 --> 00:00:52.440
 and carter you open your executed and 

00:00:48.300 --> 00:00:54.570
 you type charly06 when you do 

00:00:52.440 --> 00:00:58.850
 languages or anything of when 

00:00:54.570 --> 00:01:00.239
 you have to look for characters 

00:00:58.850 --> 00:01:03.449
 now 

00:01:00.239 --> 00:01:05.840
 trick number 4 which concerns 

00:01:03.449 --> 00:01:08.310
 lighting sound recordings 

00:01:05.840 --> 00:01:12.510
 so when you open your executed 

00:01:08.310 --> 00:01:14.220
 you step and mms point cpl me 

00:01:12.510 --> 00:01:15.810
 I use very frequently to see by 

00:01:14.220 --> 00:01:21.439
 example if my sense where my mike works 

00:01:15.810 --> 00:01:21.439
 here we see it on the screen 

00:01:22.010 --> 00:01:30.290
 now tip number 5 has the 

00:01:28.310 --> 00:01:31.340
 diagnosis but dead so to see if 

00:01:30.290 --> 00:01:32.930
 you do not have a problem with 

00:01:31.340 --> 00:01:37.370
 the memory you open your executed and 

00:01:32.930 --> 00:01:38.690
 you type mds and hd and that's it 

00:01:37.370 --> 00:01:41.990
 click on the small window below 

00:01:38.690 --> 00:01:44.900
 at his computer will turn on with all 

00:01:41.990 --> 00:01:47.180
 the memory diagnostics and now the 

00:01:44.900 --> 00:01:49.280
 small special laptop bonus 

00:01:47.180 --> 00:01:50.870
 so very useful when you are in a 

00:01:49.280 --> 00:01:52.370
 Train whether it is the food 

00:01:50.870 --> 00:01:54.170
 we are still in short supply 

00:01:52.370 --> 00:01:59.150
 feeding corner in a well 

00:01:54.170 --> 00:02:05.000
 known so you will have your executed and 

00:01:59.150 --> 00:02:06.290
 you type power cfg point cpl of any 

00:02:05.000 --> 00:02:06.979
 way everything is shortened will be registered 

00:02:06.290 --> 00:02:09.020
 in the description 

00:02:06.979 --> 00:02:12.980
 so that's where all the settings 

00:02:09.020 --> 00:02:13.910
 necessary to be able to manage a 

00:02:12.980 --> 00:02:15.170
 power management 

00:02:13.910 --> 00:02:17.560
 this is the end of this tutorial let a little 

00:02:15.170 --> 00:02:17.560
