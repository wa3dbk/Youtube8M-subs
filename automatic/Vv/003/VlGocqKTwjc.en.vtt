together<00:01:48.149> I<00:01:49.040> have<00:01:50.040> to<00:01:50.159> admit<00:01:50.280> this<00:01:50.430> is<00:01:50.640> a<00:01:50.939> case

00:01:51.530 --> 00:01:51.540 
together I have to admit this is a case

00:01:51.540 --> 00:01:53.870 
together I have to admit this is a case
you<00:01:51.810> do<00:01:52.049> not<00:01:52.200> want<00:01:52.649> to<00:01:53.070> you<00:01:53.369> want<00:01:53.520> to<00:01:53.579> do<00:01:53.640> once

00:01:53.870 --> 00:01:53.880 
you do not want to you want to do once

00:01:53.880 --> 00:01:55.730 
you do not want to you want to do once
basically<00:01:54.630> you<00:01:54.810> do<00:01:54.930> not<00:01:55.049> have<00:01:55.259> to<00:01:55.409> redo<00:01:55.710> it

00:01:55.730 --> 00:01:55.740 
basically you do not have to redo it

00:01:55.740 --> 00:01:58.429 
basically you do not have to redo it
again<00:01:55.920> you<00:01:56.909> drop<00:01:57.149> the<00:01:57.329> phone<00:01:57.509> into<00:01:58.020> this<00:01:58.200> you

00:01:58.429 --> 00:01:58.439 
again you drop the phone into this you

00:01:58.439 --> 00:02:00.709 
again you drop the phone into this you
can<00:01:58.590> see<00:01:58.770> sort<00:01:58.979> of<00:01:59.100> locks<00:01:59.340> in<00:01:59.640> it<00:02:00.180> does<00:02:00.390> have<00:02:00.689> a

00:02:00.709 --> 00:02:00.719 
can see sort of locks in it does have a

00:02:00.719 --> 00:02:03.679 
can see sort of locks in it does have a
space<00:02:01.110> for<00:02:01.350> the<00:02:01.439> lanyard<00:02:01.890> you<00:02:02.579> know<00:02:03.210> holster

00:02:03.679 --> 00:02:03.689 
space for the lanyard you know holster

00:02:03.689 --> 00:02:05.389 
space for the lanyard you know holster
thing<00:02:03.930> but<00:02:04.229> you're<00:02:04.680> going<00:02:04.920> to<00:02:04.979> want<00:02:05.100> to<00:02:05.280> take

00:02:05.389 --> 00:02:05.399 
thing but you're going to want to take

00:02:05.399 --> 00:02:07.039 
thing but you're going to want to take
that<00:02:05.549> off<00:02:05.759> and<00:02:05.790> maybe<00:02:06.299> put<00:02:06.570> it<00:02:06.659> on<00:02:06.780> later

00:02:07.039 --> 00:02:07.049 
that off and maybe put it on later

00:02:07.049 --> 00:02:08.749 
that off and maybe put it on later
because<00:02:07.469> you<00:02:07.680> can't<00:02:07.950> feed<00:02:08.190> it<00:02:08.220> through<00:02:08.580> the

00:02:08.749 --> 00:02:08.759 
because you can't feed it through the

00:02:08.759 --> 00:02:11.180 
because you can't feed it through the
system<00:02:08.970> so<00:02:09.599> that's<00:02:09.780> kind<00:02:10.020> of<00:02:10.050> um<00:02:10.259> you<00:02:10.500> know

00:02:11.180 --> 00:02:11.190 
system so that's kind of um you know

00:02:11.190 --> 00:02:13.620 
system so that's kind of um you know
downside<00:02:11.790> and<00:02:12.030> then<00:02:12.629> we're<00:02:12.780> going<00:02:12.930> to<00:02:12.959> snap

00:02:13.620 --> 00:02:13.630 
downside and then we're going to snap

00:02:13.630 --> 00:02:16.020 
downside and then we're going to snap
on<00:02:13.690> the<00:02:14.590> front<00:02:14.890> element<00:02:15.280> here<00:02:15.640> if<00:02:15.820> they<00:02:15.940> have

00:02:16.020 --> 00:02:16.030 
on the front element here if they have

00:02:16.030 --> 00:02:18.960 
on the front element here if they have
everything<00:02:16.390> lined<00:02:16.630> up<00:02:16.930> and<00:02:17.760> this<00:02:18.760> basically

00:02:18.960 --> 00:02:18.970 
everything lined up and this basically

00:02:18.970 --> 00:02:21.510 
everything lined up and this basically
clicks<00:02:19.600> on<00:02:19.810> it<00:02:20.050> and<00:02:20.200> it's<00:02:20.380> it's<00:02:21.220> a<00:02:21.310> little

00:02:21.510 --> 00:02:21.520 
clicks on it and it's it's a little

00:02:21.520 --> 00:02:23.730 
clicks on it and it's it's a little
tricky<00:02:21.820> and<00:02:22.030> I'm<00:02:22.150> gonna<00:02:22.450> be<00:02:22.540> honest<00:02:22.900> I<00:02:23.050> could<00:02:23.590> I

00:02:23.730 --> 00:02:23.740 
tricky and I'm gonna be honest I could I

00:02:23.740 --> 00:02:25.290 
tricky and I'm gonna be honest I could I
mean<00:02:24.070> price<00:02:24.280> struggle<00:02:24.730> putting<00:02:25.000> this<00:02:25.090> on<00:02:25.270> a

00:02:25.290 --> 00:02:25.300 
mean price struggle putting this on a

00:02:25.300 --> 00:02:28.050 
mean price struggle putting this on a
little<00:02:25.660> bit<00:02:25.920> no<00:02:26.920> so<00:02:27.100> I'm<00:02:27.160> saying<00:02:27.370> once<00:02:27.640> this<00:02:27.880> is

00:02:28.050 --> 00:02:28.060 
little bit no so I'm saying once this is

00:02:28.060 --> 00:02:30.990 
little bit no so I'm saying once this is
on<00:02:28.090> you<00:02:29.080> can<00:02:29.200> see<00:02:29.410> it<00:02:29.560> latches<00:02:30.190> on<00:02:30.490> here<00:02:30.850> with

00:02:30.990 --> 00:02:31.000 
on you can see it latches on here with

00:02:31.000 --> 00:02:34.560 
on you can see it latches on here with
these<00:02:31.150> little<00:02:31.330> clips<00:02:32.850> you<00:02:33.850> don't<00:02:34.180> want<00:02:34.420> to

00:02:34.560 --> 00:02:34.570 
these little clips you don't want to

00:02:34.570 --> 00:02:37.740 
these little clips you don't want to
take<00:02:34.780> this<00:02:35.050> off<00:02:35.320> and<00:02:35.350> I<00:02:35.680> think<00:02:35.890> is<00:02:36.180> locked<00:02:37.180> down

00:02:37.740 --> 00:02:37.750 
take this off and I think is locked down

00:02:37.750 --> 00:02:40.140 
take this off and I think is locked down
as<00:02:38.380> much<00:02:38.530> as<00:02:38.590> you<00:02:38.830> can<00:02:38.980> get<00:02:39.190> so<00:02:39.460> you<00:02:39.880> get<00:02:40.030> your

00:02:40.140 --> 00:02:40.150 
as much as you can get so you get your

00:02:40.150 --> 00:02:42.210 
as much as you can get so you get your
hardshell<00:02:40.720> plastic<00:02:41.560> and<00:02:41.800> now<00:02:41.890> we're<00:02:42.040> going<00:02:42.130> to

00:02:42.210 --> 00:02:42.220 
hardshell plastic and now we're going to

00:02:42.220 --> 00:02:45.660 
hardshell plastic and now we're going to
put<00:02:42.370> the<00:02:42.490> rubber<00:02:42.670> sealant<00:02:43.330> on<00:02:43.920> because<00:02:44.920> you

00:02:45.660 --> 00:02:45.670 
put the rubber sealant on because you

00:02:45.670 --> 00:02:47.520 
put the rubber sealant on because you
want<00:02:45.910> your<00:02:46.120> shock<00:02:46.630> protection<00:02:46.900> in<00:02:47.290> case<00:02:47.440> you

00:02:47.520 --> 00:02:47.530 
want your shock protection in case you

00:02:47.530 --> 00:02:51.600 
want your shock protection in case you
actually<00:02:47.680> drop<00:02:48.070> it<00:02:49.230> and<00:02:50.230> you<00:02:50.650> can<00:02:50.770> see<00:02:51.040> it's

00:02:51.600 --> 00:02:51.610 
actually drop it and you can see it's

00:02:51.610 --> 00:02:53.850 
actually drop it and you can see it's
got<00:02:51.820> these<00:02:51.940> little<00:02:52.240> rubber<00:02:52.360> ports<00:02:52.900> to<00:02:53.380> all<00:02:53.650> to

00:02:53.850 --> 00:02:53.860 
got these little rubber ports to all to

00:02:53.860 --> 00:02:55.200 
got these little rubber ports to all to
protect<00:02:54.040> your<00:02:54.370> ports<00:02:54.670> I<00:02:54.760> should<00:02:54.940> say<00:02:55.060> these

00:02:55.200 --> 00:02:55.210 
protect your ports I should say these

00:02:55.210 --> 00:02:57.600 
protect your ports I should say these
opening<00:02:55.990> two<00:02:56.110> little<00:02:56.290> gaskets<00:02:56.800> went<00:02:57.400> up<00:02:57.460> there

00:02:57.600 --> 00:02:57.610 
opening two little gaskets went up there

00:02:57.610 --> 00:03:01.560 
opening two little gaskets went up there

of it so it's not all inside but that's

00:03:19.300 --> 00:03:20.220 
of it so it's not all inside but that's
something<00:03:19.570> you<00:03:19.600> want<00:03:19.750> to<00:03:19.780> be<00:03:19.870> careful<00:03:20.080> of

00:03:20.220 --> 00:03:20.230 
something you want to be careful of

00:03:22.200 --> 00:03:22.210 
there's the back look at that it is such

00:03:22.210 --> 00:03:23.640 
there's the back look at that it is such
a<00:03:22.300> massive<00:03:22.660> case<00:03:22.840> now<00:03:23.080> the<00:03:23.140> camera<00:03:23.620> is

00:03:23.640 --> 00:03:23.650 
a massive case now the camera is

00:03:23.650 --> 00:03:26.460 
a massive case now the camera is
recessed<00:03:24.280> oh<00:03:24.750> it<00:03:25.750> goes<00:03:25.840> to<00:03:25.960> show<00:03:26.140> you<00:03:26.230> just<00:03:26.350> how

00:03:26.460 --> 00:03:26.470 
recessed oh it goes to show you just how

00:03:26.470 --> 00:03:29.040 
recessed oh it goes to show you just how
big<00:03:26.740> this<00:03:26.860> is<00:03:26.920> but<00:03:27.610> you<00:03:28.090> know<00:03:28.210> I<00:03:28.510> could<00:03:28.870> pretty

00:03:29.040 --> 00:03:29.050 
big this is but you know I could pretty

00:03:29.050 --> 00:03:30.840 
big this is but you know I could pretty
much<00:03:29.140> do<00:03:29.410> that<00:03:29.590> probably<00:03:30.040> on<00:03:30.220> pavement<00:03:30.670> and

00:03:30.840 --> 00:03:30.850 
much do that probably on pavement and

00:03:30.850 --> 00:03:32.640 
much do that probably on pavement and
this<00:03:31.000> thing<00:03:31.240> is<00:03:31.450> going<00:03:31.720> to<00:03:31.810> be<00:03:31.930> totally<00:03:32.440> fine

00:03:32.640 --> 00:03:32.650 
this thing is going to be totally fine

00:03:32.650 --> 00:03:36.180 
this thing is going to be totally fine
so<00:03:33.330> that's<00:03:34.330> what<00:03:34.570> the<00:03:34.630> OtterBox<00:03:35.050> case<00:03:35.920> looks

00:03:36.180 --> 00:03:36.190 
so that's what the OtterBox case looks

00:03:36.190 --> 00:03:40.440 
so that's what the OtterBox case looks

bad in the hand it definitely feels

00:03:42.310 --> 00:03:45.150
