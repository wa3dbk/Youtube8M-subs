00:02:37.440 --> 00:02:37.450 
turn into a harem or not but we can

00:02:37.450 --> 00:02:39.060 
turn into a harem or not but we can
definitely<00:02:37.630> see<00:02:37.959> the<00:02:38.080> start<00:02:38.440> of<00:02:38.650> what<00:02:38.860> seeing

00:02:39.060 --> 00:02:39.070 
definitely see the start of what seeing

00:02:39.070 --> 00:02:40.710 
definitely see the start of what seeing
all<00:02:39.190> these<00:02:39.310> girls<00:02:39.489> crushing<00:02:40.090> over<00:02:40.300> stalks<00:02:40.510> you

all these girls crushing over stalks you

00:02:40.720 --> 00:02:42.449 
all these girls crushing over stalks you
so<00:02:40.900> hopefully<00:02:41.320> doesn't<00:02:41.800> evolve<00:02:42.070> into

00:02:42.449 --> 00:02:42.459 
so hopefully doesn't evolve into

00:02:42.459 --> 00:02:44.790 
so hopefully doesn't evolve into
something<00:02:42.790> like<00:02:42.970> that<00:02:43.030> now<00:02:43.690> going<00:02:44.200> past<00:02:44.440> that

00:02:44.790 --> 00:02:44.800 
something like that now going past that

00:02:44.800 --> 00:02:46.680 
something like that now going past that

honestly<00:03:22.269> meant<00:03:22.480> the<00:03:22.870> dude<00:03:23.110> that<00:03:23.320> was<00:03:23.440> driving

00:03:23.699 --> 00:03:23.709 
honestly meant the dude that was driving

00:03:23.709 --> 00:03:25.289 
honestly meant the dude that was driving
the<00:03:23.890> vehicle<00:03:24.070> on<00:03:24.310> the<00:03:24.370> other<00:03:24.519> road<00:03:24.760> it<00:03:25.060> seems

00:03:25.289 --> 00:03:25.299 
the vehicle on the other road it seems

00:03:25.299 --> 00:03:26.940 
the vehicle on the other road it seems
like<00:03:25.450> it<00:03:25.540> was<00:03:25.630> premeditated<00:03:26.049> the<00:03:26.530> Holly<00:03:26.709> was

00:03:26.940 --> 00:03:26.950 
like it was premeditated the Holly was

00:03:26.950 --> 00:03:28.410 
like it was premeditated the Holly was
crashing<00:03:27.400> because<00:03:27.489> I<00:03:27.670> mean<00:03:27.820> his<00:03:27.940> vehicle<00:03:28.269> just

00:03:28.410 --> 00:03:28.420 
crashing because I mean his vehicle just

00:03:28.420 --> 00:03:30.390 
crashing because I mean his vehicle just
blows<00:03:28.780> up<00:03:28.810> out<00:03:29.170> of<00:03:29.320> nowhere<00:03:29.440> so<00:03:29.829> I<00:03:30.070> felt<00:03:30.310> like

00:03:30.390 --> 00:03:30.400 
blows up out of nowhere so I felt like

00:03:30.400 --> 00:03:31.350 
blows up out of nowhere so I felt like
the<00:03:30.549> dude<00:03:30.700> that<00:03:30.880> was<00:03:30.970> driving<00:03:31.239> that<00:03:31.299> vehicle

00:03:31.350 --> 00:03:31.360 
the dude that was driving that vehicle

00:03:31.360 --> 00:03:33.509 
the dude that was driving that vehicle
most<00:03:31.810> like<00:03:31.989> as<00:03:32.170> an<00:03:32.290> enemy<00:03:32.440> and<00:03:32.769> he's<00:03:33.310> probably

00:03:33.509 --> 00:03:33.519 
most like as an enemy and he's probably

00:03:33.519 --> 00:03:35.190 
most like as an enemy and he's probably
just<00:03:33.790> did<00:03:33.970> that<00:03:34.060> itself<00:03:34.390> to<00:03:34.510> self-destruct

00:03:35.190 --> 00:03:35.200 
just did that itself to self-destruct

00:03:35.200 --> 00:03:36.690 
just did that itself to self-destruct
and<00:03:35.320> tried<00:03:35.590> to<00:03:35.739> hit<00:03:35.890> the<00:03:35.920> bus<00:03:36.160> and<00:03:36.310> kill<00:03:36.489> some

00:03:36.690 --> 00:03:36.700 
and tried to hit the bus and kill some

00:03:36.700 --> 00:03:38.160 
and tried to hit the bus and kill some
people<00:03:37.000> I<00:03:37.150> think<00:03:37.510> that's<00:03:37.660> exactly<00:03:37.780> what<00:03:38.049> he

00:03:38.160 --> 00:03:38.170 
people I think that's exactly what he

00:03:38.170 --> 00:03:39.539 
people I think that's exactly what he
was<00:03:38.260> doing<00:03:38.560> but<00:03:38.890> at<00:03:38.980> the<00:03:39.040> end<00:03:39.070> when<00:03:39.310> you<00:03:39.400> see

00:03:39.539 --> 00:03:39.549 
was doing but at the end when you see

00:03:39.549 --> 00:03:40.979 
was doing but at the end when you see
everybody<00:03:39.850> stop<00:03:40.150> on<00:03:40.390> their<00:03:40.630> like<00:03:40.780> saying

00:03:40.979 --> 00:03:40.989 
everybody stop on their like saying

00:03:40.989 --> 00:03:42.180 
everybody stop on their like saying
vanish<00:03:41.320> and<00:03:41.410> stuff<00:03:41.590> and<00:03:41.739> activating<00:03:42.100> their

00:03:42.180 --> 00:03:42.190 
vanish and stuff and activating their

00:03:42.190 --> 00:03:43.590 
vanish and stuff and activating their
sadie's<00:03:42.549> and<00:03:42.670> all<00:03:42.760> their<00:03:42.880> magic<00:03:43.060> power<00:03:43.390> and

00:03:43.590 --> 00:03:43.600 
sadie's and all their magic power and

00:03:43.600 --> 00:03:45.000 
sadie's and all their magic power and
stuff<00:03:43.780> I<00:03:43.989> think<00:03:44.200> the<00:03:44.440> reason<00:03:44.650> why<00:03:44.769> they<00:03:44.950> were

00:03:45.000 --> 00:03:45.010 
stuff I think the reason why they were

00:03:45.010 --> 00:03:46.410 
stuff I think the reason why they were
told<00:03:45.250> to<00:03:45.340> stop<00:03:45.579> is<00:03:45.820> because<00:03:46.090> if<00:03:46.239> they<00:03:46.360> shoot

00:03:46.410 --> 00:03:46.420 
told to stop is because if they shoot

00:03:46.420 --> 00:03:47.970 
told to stop is because if they shoot
that<00:03:46.720> car<00:03:46.900> they'll<00:03:47.079> kill<00:03:47.260> the<00:03:47.350> person<00:03:47.680> side<00:03:47.860> of

00:03:47.970 --> 00:03:47.980 
that car they'll kill the person side of

00:03:47.980 --> 00:03:49.410 
that car they'll kill the person side of
it<00:03:48.070> he's<00:03:48.220> alive<00:03:48.579> they<00:03:48.970> technically<00:03:49.329> don't

00:03:49.410 --> 00:03:49.420 
it he's alive they technically don't

00:03:49.420 --> 00:03:50.699 
it he's alive they technically don't
know<00:03:49.600> exactly<00:03:49.930> what<00:03:50.140> happened<00:03:50.560> to<00:03:50.590> that

00:03:50.699 --> 00:03:50.709 
know exactly what happened to that

00:03:50.709 --> 00:03:53.190 
know exactly what happened to that
vehicle<00:03:51.190> so<00:03:51.790> if<00:03:52.060> they<00:03:52.180> were<00:03:52.239> to<00:03:52.630> destroy<00:03:52.989> that

00:03:53.190 --> 00:03:53.200 
vehicle so if they were to destroy that

00:03:53.200 --> 00:03:54.390 
vehicle so if they were to destroy that
vehicle<00:03:53.620> they<00:03:53.709> would<00:03:53.829> kill<00:03:53.980> the<00:03:54.100> person
