00:00:49.310 --> 00:00:49.320 
what I did actually when you open up

00:00:49.320 --> 00:00:51.439 
what I did actually when you open up
your<00:00:49.530> safe<00:00:49.770> it's<00:00:50.100> a<00:00:50.309> you<00:00:50.910> know<00:00:51.030> it's<00:00:51.180> a<00:00:51.300> little

00:00:51.439 --> 00:00:51.449 
your safe it's a you know it's a little

00:00:51.449 --> 00:00:52.569 
your safe it's a you know it's a little
bit<00:00:51.719> dark<00:00:51.930> in<00:00:52.140> there

00:00:52.569 --> 00:00:52.579 
bit dark in there

00:00:52.579 --> 00:00:55.310 
bit dark in there
it's<00:00:53.579> almost<00:00:53.850> necessary<00:00:54.629> to<00:00:54.780> have<00:00:54.930> some<00:00:55.170> kind

00:00:55.310 --> 00:00:55.320 
it's almost necessary to have some kind

00:00:55.320 --> 00:00:57.619 
it's almost necessary to have some kind
of<00:00:55.500> lighting<00:00:55.949> I<00:00:56.190> didn't<00:00:56.760> like<00:00:56.940> what<00:00:57.180> they<00:00:57.420> had

00:00:57.619 --> 00:00:57.629 
of lighting I didn't like what they had

00:00:57.629 --> 00:00:59.299 
of lighting I didn't like what they had
on<00:00:57.660> the<00:00:57.930> market<00:00:58.320> available<00:00:58.890> for<00:00:59.100> lighting

00:00:59.299 --> 00:00:59.309 
on the market available for lighting

00:00:59.309 --> 00:01:01.490 
on the market available for lighting
especially<00:01:00.210> doing<00:01:00.390> like<00:01:00.629> the<00:01:00.809> prices<00:01:01.350> they

00:01:01.490 --> 00:01:01.500 
especially doing like the prices they

00:01:01.500 --> 00:01:03.500 
especially doing like the prices they
were<00:01:01.559> charging<00:01:02.160> so<00:01:02.609> I<00:01:02.670> figured<00:01:03.090> I'd<00:01:03.210> do<00:01:03.359> it

00:01:03.500 --> 00:01:03.510 
were charging so I figured I'd do it

00:01:03.510 --> 00:01:06.320 
were charging so I figured I'd do it
myself<00:01:04.100> so<00:01:05.100> if<00:01:05.159> you<00:01:05.309> see<00:01:05.549> here<00:01:05.760> a<00:01:05.820> little<00:01:06.150> red

00:01:06.320 --> 00:01:06.330 
myself so if you see here a little red

00:01:06.330 --> 00:01:11.660 
myself so if you see here a little red
light<00:01:06.890> that's<00:01:07.890> my<00:01:08.220> switch<00:01:10.189> that's<00:01:11.189> the

00:01:11.660 --> 00:01:11.670 
light that's my switch that's the

00:01:11.670 --> 00:01:14.630 
light that's my switch that's the
lighting<00:01:12.150> I<00:01:12.360> just<00:01:13.200> put<00:01:13.470> some<00:01:13.500> LED<00:01:14.130> lights<00:01:14.159> in

00:01:14.630 --> 00:01:14.640 
lighting I just put some LED lights in

00:01:14.640 --> 00:01:20.300 
lighting I just put some LED lights in
there<00:01:15.830> well<00:01:17.030> 250<00:01:18.030> of<00:01:18.180> them<00:01:18.330> to<00:01:18.479> be<00:01:18.630> exact<00:01:19.310> but

00:01:20.300 --> 00:01:20.310 
there well 250 of them to be exact but

00:01:20.310 --> 00:01:22.810 
there well 250 of them to be exact but
it's<00:01:20.490> easier<00:01:20.880> than<00:01:21.060> it<00:01:21.210> sounds

00:01:22.810 --> 00:01:22.820 
it's easier than it sounds

00:01:22.820 --> 00:01:26.960 
it's easier than it sounds
what<00:01:23.820> I<00:01:23.850> did<00:01:24.150> first<00:01:24.570> is<00:01:24.869> I<00:01:25.530> have<00:01:26.100> a<00:01:26.130> hole<00:01:26.610> in<00:01:26.640> the

00:01:26.960 --> 00:01:26.970 
what I did first is I have a hole in the

00:01:26.970 --> 00:01:29.810 
what I did first is I have a hole in the
back<00:01:27.150> of<00:01:27.330> my<00:01:27.479> safe<00:01:27.780> a<00:01:28.400> pre-drilled<00:01:29.400> from<00:01:29.700> the

00:01:29.810 --> 00:01:29.820 
back of my safe a pre-drilled from the

00:01:29.820 --> 00:01:31.700 
back of my safe a pre-drilled from the
factory<00:01:30.299> so<00:01:30.509> that<00:01:31.020> you<00:01:31.290> can<00:01:31.500> add<00:01:31.680> a

00:01:31.700 --> 00:01:31.710 
factory so that you can add a

00:01:31.710 --> 00:01:34.880 
factory so that you can add a
dehumidifier<00:01:32.340> in<00:01:33.000> the<00:01:33.689> safe<00:01:33.960> but<00:01:34.350> I<00:01:34.530> didn't

00:01:34.880 --> 00:01:34.890 
dehumidifier in the safe but I didn't

00:01:34.890 --> 00:01:37.700 
dehumidifier in the safe but I didn't
just<00:01:35.159> want<00:01:35.400> a<00:01:35.670> dehumidifier<00:01:36.540> I<00:01:36.930> wanted<00:01:37.409> some

00:01:37.700 --> 00:01:37.710 
just want a dehumidifier I wanted some

00:01:37.710 --> 00:01:41.120 
just want a dehumidifier I wanted some
lighting<00:01:38.009> also<00:01:38.369> and<00:01:38.880> so<00:01:39.720> I<00:01:40.049> installed<00:01:40.860> this

00:01:41.120 --> 00:01:41.130 
lighting also and so I installed this

00:01:41.130 --> 00:01:45.429 
lighting also and so I installed this
outlet<00:01:41.549> box<00:01:41.850> myself<00:01:42.119> ran<00:01:42.930> some<00:01:43.200> wiring<00:01:43.439> in<00:01:43.979> and

00:01:45.429 --> 00:01:45.439 
outlet box myself ran some wiring in and

00:01:45.439 --> 00:01:49.450 
outlet box myself ran some wiring in and
put<00:01:46.439> the<00:01:46.590> Box<00:01:46.860> in<00:01:47.100> there<00:01:47.280> I<00:01:47.840> wasn't<00:01:48.840> happy<00:01:49.110> with

00:01:49.450 --> 00:01:49.460 
put the Box in there I wasn't happy with

00:01:49.460 --> 00:01:52.580 
put the Box in there I wasn't happy with
just<00:01:50.460> screwing<00:01:50.850> it<00:01:50.970> to<00:01:51.270> to<00:01:51.960> the<00:01:52.079> wall<00:01:52.290> of<00:01:52.470> the

00:01:52.580 --> 00:01:52.590 
just screwing it to to the wall of the

00:01:52.590 --> 00:01:56.810 
just screwing it to to the wall of the
safe<00:01:52.890> so<00:01:53.820> I<00:01:53.850> actually<00:01:55.189> had<00:01:56.189> a<00:01:56.219> scrap<00:01:56.610> piece<00:01:56.790> of

00:01:56.810 --> 00:01:56.820 
safe so I actually had a scrap piece of

00:01:56.820 --> 00:02:00.670 
safe so I actually had a scrap piece of
wood<00:01:57.090> wrapped<00:01:57.930> it<00:01:58.140> in<00:01:58.259> in<00:01:58.619> this<00:01:59.369> gray<00:01:59.610> carpet

00:02:00.670 --> 00:02:00.680 
wood wrapped it in in this gray carpet

00:02:00.680 --> 00:02:04.789 
wood wrapped it in in this gray carpet
and<00:02:01.790> contact<00:02:02.790> cement<00:02:03.149> and<00:02:03.450> so<00:02:04.229> that<00:02:04.469> gave<00:02:04.740> me

00:02:04.789 --> 00:02:04.799 
and contact cement and so that gave me

00:02:04.799 --> 00:02:06.800 
and contact cement and so that gave me
something<00:02:05.610> I<00:02:05.700> could<00:02:05.880> screw<00:02:06.149> the<00:02:06.299> outlet<00:02:06.630> box

00:02:06.800 --> 00:02:06.810 
something I could screw the outlet box

00:02:06.810 --> 00:02:10.330 
something I could screw the outlet box
to<00:02:07.170> and<00:02:07.439> this<00:02:08.129> just<00:02:09.090> has<00:02:09.270> velcro<00:02:09.569> on<00:02:09.929> the<00:02:09.959> back

00:02:10.330 --> 00:02:10.340 
to and this just has velcro on the back

00:02:10.340 --> 00:02:13.699 
to and this just has velcro on the back
sticks<00:02:11.340> to<00:02:11.550> the<00:02:11.640> wall<00:02:11.670> and<00:02:12.150> it's<00:02:12.810> cut<00:02:13.080> to

00:02:13.699 --> 00:02:13.709 
sticks to the wall and it's cut to

00:02:13.709 --> 00:02:16.160 
sticks to the wall and it's cut to
and<00:02:14.069> it's<00:02:14.879> kind<00:02:15.120> of<00:02:15.209> pressure<00:02:15.450> fit<00:02:15.840> in<00:02:15.959> there

00:02:16.160 --> 00:02:16.170 
and it's kind of pressure fit in there

00:02:16.170 --> 00:02:18.440 
and it's kind of pressure fit in there
so<00:02:16.200> I'm<00:02:16.560> happy<00:02:16.920> with<00:02:17.069> it<00:02:17.129> it's<00:02:17.940> not<00:02:18.150> permanent

00:02:18.440 --> 00:02:18.450 
so I'm happy with it it's not permanent

00:02:18.450 --> 00:02:21.289 
so I'm happy with it it's not permanent
I<00:02:18.810> can<00:02:19.019> remove<00:02:19.260> it<00:02:19.440> if<00:02:19.560> I<00:02:19.680> ever<00:02:19.769> need<00:02:20.040> to<00:02:20.299> but

00:02:21.289 --> 00:02:21.299 
I can remove it if I ever need to but

00:02:21.299 --> 00:02:23.240 
I can remove it if I ever need to but
now<00:02:21.480> on<00:02:21.659> this<00:02:21.810> board<00:02:22.080> a<00:02:22.200> have<00:02:22.290> also<00:02:22.650> screwed<00:02:23.040> in

00:02:23.240 --> 00:02:23.250 
now on this board a have also screwed in

00:02:23.250 --> 00:02:27.649 
now on this board a have also screwed in
the<00:02:24.239> transformer<00:02:25.080> this<00:02:25.739> is<00:02:25.970> converting<00:02:26.970> 110

00:02:27.649 --> 00:02:27.659 
the transformer this is converting 110

00:02:27.659 --> 00:02:30.710 
the transformer this is converting 110
volts<00:02:27.989> to<00:02:28.200> 12<00:02:28.470> volts<00:02:28.799> for<00:02:28.980> my<00:02:29.159> LED<00:02:29.610> lighting<00:02:30.060> so

00:02:30.710 --> 00:02:30.720 
volts to 12 volts for my LED lighting so

00:02:30.720 --> 00:02:32.869 
volts to 12 volts for my LED lighting so
it<00:02:31.019> was<00:02:31.170> a<00:02:31.200> fun<00:02:31.500> project<00:02:31.829> I'm<00:02:32.310> no<00:02:32.459> pro<00:02:32.700> with

00:02:32.869 --> 00:02:32.879 
it was a fun project I'm no pro with

00:02:32.879 --> 00:02:35.390 
it was a fun project I'm no pro with
wiring<00:02:33.150> don't<00:02:33.959> know<00:02:34.079> much<00:02:34.290> about<00:02:34.319> it<00:02:34.829> but<00:02:35.340> I

00:02:35.390 --> 00:02:35.400 
wiring don't know much about it but I

00:02:35.400 --> 00:02:37.970 
wiring don't know much about it but I
know<00:02:35.519> enough<00:02:36.030> to<00:02:36.060> get<00:02:36.629> into<00:02:36.780> trouble<00:02:37.290> I<00:02:37.470> knew

00:02:37.970 --> 00:02:37.980 
know enough to get into trouble I knew

00:02:37.980 --> 00:02:40.280 
know enough to get into trouble I knew
enough<00:02:38.280> to<00:02:38.310> figure<00:02:38.879> out<00:02:39.030> how<00:02:39.180> I<00:02:39.209> can<00:02:39.569> get<00:02:40.230> this

00:02:40.280 --> 00:02:40.290 
enough to figure out how I can get this

00:02:40.290 --> 00:02:43.580 
enough to figure out how I can get this
thing<00:02:40.799> to<00:02:41.040> work<00:02:41.069> out<00:02:41.519> so<00:02:42.180> some<00:02:42.810> of<00:02:42.870> these<00:02:43.079> wires

00:02:43.580 --> 00:02:43.590 
thing to work out so some of these wires

00:02:43.590 --> 00:02:46.849 
thing to work out so some of these wires
run<00:02:43.980> up<00:02:44.129> to<00:02:44.310> my<00:02:44.430> switch<00:02:44.730> here<00:02:45.590> I've<00:02:46.590> hidden

00:02:46.849 --> 00:02:46.859 
run up to my switch here I've hidden

00:02:46.859 --> 00:02:48.949 
run up to my switch here I've hidden
most<00:02:47.190> of<00:02:47.310> the<00:02:47.370> wires<00:02:47.549> pretty<00:02:47.940> well<00:02:48.150> these<00:02:48.720> are

00:02:48.949 --> 00:02:48.959 
most of the wires pretty well these are

00:02:48.959 --> 00:02:51.890 
most of the wires pretty well these are
just<00:02:48.989> strips<00:02:49.440> of<00:02:49.620> velcro<00:02:50.450> to<00:02:51.450> hold<00:02:51.480> everything

00:02:51.890 --> 00:02:51.900 
just strips of velcro to hold everything

00:02:51.900 --> 00:02:54.979 
just strips of velcro to hold everything
into<00:02:52.230> place<00:02:52.640> and<00:02:53.640> I<00:02:54.209> was<00:02:54.390> just<00:02:54.629> going<00:02:54.810> to<00:02:54.840> do<00:02:54.959> a

00:02:54.979 --> 00:02:54.989 
into place and I was just going to do a

00:02:54.989 --> 00:02:56.869 
into place and I was just going to do a
boring<00:02:55.379> old<00:02:55.470> switch<00:02:55.890> but<00:02:56.160> I<00:02:56.190> figured<00:02:56.519> I<00:02:56.609> really

00:02:56.869 --> 00:02:56.879 
boring old switch but I figured I really

00:02:56.879 --> 00:02:59.119 
boring old switch but I figured I really
wanted<00:02:57.150> something<00:02:57.510> with<00:02:57.780> the<00:02:57.900> light<00:02:58.140> so<00:02:59.010> in

00:02:59.119 --> 00:02:59.129 
wanted something with the light so in

00:02:59.129 --> 00:03:01.309 
wanted something with the light so in
the<00:02:59.220> dark<00:02:59.459> situation<00:03:00.180> you<00:03:00.720> can<00:03:00.870> find<00:03:01.170> the

00:03:01.309 --> 00:03:01.319 
the dark situation you can find the

00:03:01.319 --> 00:03:05.690 
the dark situation you can find the
switch<00:03:01.590> real<00:03:01.859> easy<00:03:02.099> so<00:03:03.470> I<00:03:04.470> ran<00:03:04.769> up<00:03:04.799> I<00:03:05.069> ran<00:03:05.430> power

00:03:05.690 --> 00:03:05.700 
switch real easy so I ran up I ran power

00:03:05.700 --> 00:03:07.309 
switch real easy so I ran up I ran power
up<00:03:05.970> to<00:03:06.120> the<00:03:06.209> switch<00:03:06.480> so<00:03:06.720> that<00:03:06.750> that<00:03:07.079> light

00:03:07.309 --> 00:03:07.319 
up to the switch so that that light

00:03:07.319 --> 00:03:11.030 
up to the switch so that that light
could<00:03:07.560> work<00:03:07.940> and<00:03:08.940> then<00:03:09.900> the<00:03:10.109> other<00:03:10.230> wires<00:03:10.560> here

00:03:11.030 --> 00:03:11.040 
could work and then the other wires here

00:03:11.040 --> 00:03:17.170 
could work and then the other wires here
run<00:03:12.000> to<00:03:12.209> the<00:03:12.390> LED<00:03:12.750> lighting<00:03:13.940> looks<00:03:14.940> like<00:03:15.209> that

00:03:17.170 --> 00:03:17.180 
run to the LED lighting looks like that

00:03:17.180 --> 00:03:21.349 
run to the LED lighting looks like that
and<00:03:18.260> all<00:03:19.260> I<00:03:19.290> did<00:03:19.650> is<00:03:19.859> I<00:03:20.040> just<00:03:20.760> put<00:03:21.060> the<00:03:21.209> LED

00:03:21.349 --> 00:03:21.359 
and all I did is I just put the LED

00:03:21.359 --> 00:03:26.270 
and all I did is I just put the LED
lighting<00:03:22.160> around<00:03:23.160> the<00:03:23.790> frame<00:03:24.950> this<00:03:25.950> front

00:03:26.270 --> 00:03:26.280 
lighting around the frame this front

00:03:26.280 --> 00:03:29.360 
lighting around the frame this front
frame<00:03:26.660> or<00:03:27.660> right<00:03:28.139> around<00:03:28.260> the<00:03:28.500> door<00:03:28.709> area<00:03:29.010> I

00:03:29.360 --> 00:03:29.370 
frame or right around the door area I

00:03:29.370 --> 00:03:31.250 
frame or right around the door area I
didn't<00:03:29.819> put<00:03:29.970> anything<00:03:30.239> on<00:03:30.540> the<00:03:30.690> roof<00:03:30.900> or

00:03:31.250 --> 00:03:31.260 
didn't put anything on the roof or

00:03:31.260 --> 00:03:33.860 
didn't put anything on the roof or
anything<00:03:31.680> on<00:03:31.950> the<00:03:31.980> shelves<00:03:32.639> I<00:03:32.790> planned<00:03:33.690> on

00:03:33.860 --> 00:03:33.870 
anything on the shelves I planned on

00:03:33.870 --> 00:03:35.750 
anything on the shelves I planned on
doing<00:03:33.900> it<00:03:34.379> but<00:03:34.650> you<00:03:34.680> know<00:03:34.919> what<00:03:35.069> I<00:03:35.220> started

00:03:35.750 --> 00:03:35.760 
doing it but you know what I started

00:03:35.760 --> 00:03:39.140 
doing it but you know what I started
with<00:03:36.209> just<00:03:36.950> framing<00:03:37.950> and<00:03:38.250> lights<00:03:38.519> and<00:03:38.849> you

00:03:39.140 --> 00:03:39.150 
with just framing and lights and you

00:03:39.150 --> 00:03:40.879 
with just framing and lights and you
know<00:03:39.299> what<00:03:39.480> I<00:03:39.750> think<00:03:40.410> that's<00:03:40.590> going<00:03:40.769> to<00:03:40.829> be

00:03:40.879 --> 00:03:40.889 
know what I think that's going to be

00:03:40.889 --> 00:03:44.750 
know what I think that's going to be
just<00:03:41.250> fine<00:03:42.590> you<00:03:43.590> know<00:03:43.709> it<00:03:43.889> lights<00:03:44.129> it<00:03:44.280> up<00:03:44.430> quite

00:03:44.750 --> 00:03:44.760 
just fine you know it lights it up quite

00:03:44.760 --> 00:03:46.939 
just fine you know it lights it up quite
a<00:03:44.819> bit<00:03:45.150> let<00:03:45.780> me<00:03:45.900> throw<00:03:46.139> a<00:03:46.169> few<00:03:46.379> things<00:03:46.620> in<00:03:46.769> there

00:03:46.939 --> 00:03:46.949 
a bit let me throw a few things in there

00:03:46.949 --> 00:03:49.580 
a bit let me throw a few things in there
so<00:03:47.190> you<00:03:47.250> can<00:03:47.459> kind<00:03:47.699> of<00:03:47.760> see<00:03:48.169> how<00:03:49.169> well<00:03:49.440> the

00:03:49.580 --> 00:03:49.590 
so you can kind of see how well the

00:03:49.590 --> 00:03:51.589 
so you can kind of see how well the
lighting<00:03:49.859> is<00:03:50.250> looks<00:03:50.970> darker<00:03:51.359> than<00:03:51.510> it

00:03:51.589 --> 00:03:51.599 
lighting is looks darker than it

00:03:51.599 --> 00:03:52.789 
lighting is looks darker than it
actually<00:03:52.109> is<00:03:52.230> in<00:03:52.379> real<00:03:52.590> life

00:03:52.789 --> 00:03:52.799 
actually is in real life

00:03:52.799 --> 00:03:56.599 
actually is in real life
but<00:03:53.430> still<00:03:53.819> it's<00:03:54.090> it's<00:03:54.930> poorly<00:03:55.500> lit<00:03:55.889> I<00:03:56.220> have

00:03:56.599 --> 00:03:56.609 
but still it's it's poorly lit I have

00:03:56.609 --> 00:03:58.670 
but still it's it's poorly lit I have
good<00:03:56.819> lighting<00:03:57.090> in<00:03:57.329> this<00:03:57.449> room<00:03:57.780> and<00:03:58.079> the<00:03:58.440> safe

00:03:58.670 --> 00:03:58.680 
good lighting in this room and the safe

00:03:58.680 --> 00:04:01.220 
good lighting in this room and the safe
is<00:03:58.889> just<00:03:59.190> dark<00:03:59.519> so<00:03:59.910> these<00:04:00.540> lights<00:04:00.810> are<00:04:01.019> great

00:04:01.220 --> 00:04:01.230 
is just dark so these lights are great

00:04:01.230 --> 00:04:04.220 
is just dark so these lights are great
so<00:04:01.829> flip<00:04:02.129> it<00:04:02.280> on<00:04:02.569> illuminates<00:04:03.569> all<00:04:03.750> of<00:04:04.109> the

00:04:04.220 --> 00:04:04.230 
so flip it on illuminates all of the

00:04:04.230 --> 00:04:06.979 
so flip it on illuminates all of the
shelves<00:04:04.769> you<00:04:04.980> can<00:04:05.730> see<00:04:06.030> we<00:04:06.150> do<00:04:06.329> have<00:04:06.359> some<00:04:06.750> dark

00:04:06.979 --> 00:04:06.989 
shelves you can see we do have some dark

00:04:06.989 --> 00:04:12.589 
shelves you can see we do have some dark
areas<00:04:07.260> some<00:04:07.829> shadows<00:04:08.599> created<00:04:09.599> but<00:04:10.260> not<00:04:11.599> you

00:04:12.589 --> 00:04:12.599 
areas some shadows created but not you

00:04:12.599 --> 00:04:16.789 
areas some shadows created but not you
know<00:04:12.720> they're<00:04:12.900> not<00:04:13.019> too<00:04:13.230> bad<00:04:14.750> so<00:04:15.750> there's<00:04:16.709> a

00:04:16.789 --> 00:04:16.799 
know they're not too bad so there's a

00:04:16.799 --> 00:04:19.009 
know they're not too bad so there's a
lot<00:04:17.010> of<00:04:17.039> shadow<00:04:17.370> deep<00:04:18.030> back<00:04:18.359> here<00:04:18.660> on<00:04:18.780> that

00:04:19.009 --> 00:04:19.019 
lot of shadow deep back here on that

00:04:19.019 --> 00:04:21.349 
lot of shadow deep back here on that
shelf<00:04:19.380> but<00:04:19.769> it's<00:04:20.310> still<00:04:20.579> light<00:04:20.849> enough<00:04:21.150> where

00:04:21.349 --> 00:04:21.359 
shelf but it's still light enough where

00:04:21.359 --> 00:04:23.820 
shelf but it's still light enough where
you<00:04:21.449> can<00:04:21.630> see<00:04:21.989> what<00:04:22.650> he<00:04:22.830> got<00:04:23.039> back<00:04:23.250> there

00:04:23.820 --> 00:04:23.830 
you can see what he got back there

00:04:23.830 --> 00:04:28.830 
you can see what he got back there
here's<00:04:25.650> here's<00:04:26.650> the<00:04:26.830> LEDs<00:04:27.250> I<00:04:27.610> still<00:04:28.449> have<00:04:28.629> some

00:04:28.830 --> 00:04:28.840 
here's here's the LEDs I still have some

00:04:28.840 --> 00:04:31.140 
here's here's the LEDs I still have some
left<00:04:29.080> so<00:04:29.259> I<00:04:29.319> can<00:04:29.379> still<00:04:29.919> run<00:04:30.190> some<00:04:30.550> if<00:04:30.729> I<00:04:30.849> want

00:04:31.140 --> 00:04:31.150 
left so I can still run some if I want

00:04:31.150 --> 00:04:33.570 
left so I can still run some if I want
maybe<00:04:31.930> to<00:04:32.169> the<00:04:32.289> bottom<00:04:32.650> of<00:04:32.800> this<00:04:32.919> shelf<00:04:33.310> or

00:04:33.570 --> 00:04:33.580 
maybe to the bottom of this shelf or

00:04:33.580 --> 00:04:36.089 
maybe to the bottom of this shelf or
anywhere<00:04:34.000> else<00:04:34.180> I<00:04:34.360> want<00:04:34.599> in<00:04:34.780> here<00:04:34.810> I<00:04:35.259> can<00:04:35.889> run

00:04:36.089 --> 00:04:36.099 
anywhere else I want in here I can run

00:04:36.099 --> 00:04:40.680 
anywhere else I want in here I can run
these<00:04:36.310> I<00:04:36.490> got<00:04:36.639> about<00:04:36.849> 50<00:04:37.240> more<00:04:37.720> LEDs<00:04:37.930> left<00:04:39.690> you

00:04:40.680 --> 00:04:40.690 
these I got about 50 more LEDs left you

00:04:40.690 --> 00:04:42.119 
these I got about 50 more LEDs left you
know<00:04:40.810> it<00:04:40.930> came<00:04:41.169> originally<00:04:41.470> with<00:04:41.919> about

00:04:42.119 --> 00:04:42.129 
know it came originally with about

00:04:42.129 --> 00:04:44.809 
know it came originally with about
sixteen<00:04:42.639> and<00:04:42.669> a<00:04:42.849> half<00:04:42.879> feet<00:04:43.330> or<00:04:43.569> three<00:04:44.139> hundred

00:04:44.809 --> 00:04:44.819 
sixteen and a half feet or three hundred

00:04:44.819 --> 00:04:48.990 
sixteen and a half feet or three hundred
LED<00:04:45.819> lights<00:04:46.620> I'll<00:04:47.620> put<00:04:47.830> links<00:04:48.069> to<00:04:48.340> where<00:04:48.639> I<00:04:48.669> got

00:04:48.990 --> 00:04:49.000 
LED lights I'll put links to where I got

00:04:49.000 --> 00:04:50.790 
LED lights I'll put links to where I got
these<00:04:49.270> so<00:04:49.509> that<00:04:49.539> you<00:04:49.659> can<00:04:49.870> do<00:04:49.990> it<00:04:50.110> yourself<00:04:50.199> I

00:04:50.790 --> 00:04:50.800 
these so that you can do it yourself I

00:04:50.800 --> 00:04:53.610 
these so that you can do it yourself I
also<00:04:51.190> bought<00:04:51.520> these<00:04:51.699> connectors<00:04:52.270> so<00:04:53.229> up<00:04:53.470> in

00:04:53.610 --> 00:04:53.620 
also bought these connectors so up in

00:04:53.620 --> 00:04:54.719 
also bought these connectors so up in
the<00:04:53.740> corners<00:04:54.220> here

00:04:54.719 --> 00:04:54.729 
the corners here

00:04:54.729 --> 00:04:56.610 
the corners here
those<00:04:55.330> lights<00:04:55.690> don't<00:04:55.960> want<00:04:56.139> to<00:04:56.229> bend<00:04:56.500> very

00:04:56.610 --> 00:04:56.620 
those lights don't want to bend very

00:04:56.620 --> 00:05:00.689 
those lights don't want to bend very
well<00:04:57.099> but<00:04:57.909> you<00:04:58.030> know<00:04:58.150> the<00:04:58.300> way<00:04:58.419> I<00:04:58.449> did<00:04:58.780> it<00:04:59.699> they

00:05:00.689 --> 00:05:00.699 
well but you know the way I did it they

00:05:00.699 --> 00:05:03.059 
well but you know the way I did it they
don't<00:05:00.789> take<00:05:01.030> the<00:05:01.150> corners<00:05:01.599> as<00:05:01.810> tight<00:05:02.770> as<00:05:02.949> I

00:05:03.059 --> 00:05:03.069 
don't take the corners as tight as I

00:05:03.069 --> 00:05:05.909 
don't take the corners as tight as I
would<00:05:03.219> like<00:05:03.400> so<00:05:03.460> I<00:05:03.759> use<00:05:04.060> these<00:05:04.530> to<00:05:05.530> connect

00:05:05.909 --> 00:05:05.919 
would like so I use these to connect

00:05:05.919 --> 00:05:08.330 
would like so I use these to connect
pieces<00:05:06.159> and<00:05:06.669> the<00:05:07.030> cool<00:05:07.270> thing<00:05:07.300> about<00:05:07.629> these

00:05:08.330 --> 00:05:08.340 
pieces and the cool thing about these

00:05:08.340 --> 00:05:13.140 
pieces and the cool thing about these
you<00:05:09.340> can<00:05:09.520> cut<00:05:09.759> them<00:05:09.909> every<00:05:10.330> three<00:05:10.569> lights<00:05:12.150> see

00:05:13.140 --> 00:05:13.150 
you can cut them every three lights see

00:05:13.150 --> 00:05:17.939 
you can cut them every three lights see
there's<00:05:13.330> a<00:05:13.389> cut<00:05:13.629> line<00:05:13.840> right<00:05:14.050> there<00:05:16.860> there's<00:05:17.860> a

00:05:17.939 --> 00:05:17.949 
there's a cut line right there there's a

00:05:17.949 --> 00:05:20.159 
there's a cut line right there there's a
cut<00:05:18.190> line<00:05:18.400> you<00:05:18.580> can<00:05:18.759> cut<00:05:19.000> every<00:05:19.599> three<00:05:19.870> lights

00:05:20.159 --> 00:05:20.169 
cut line you can cut every three lights

00:05:20.169 --> 00:05:22.860 
cut line you can cut every three lights
and<00:05:20.530> still<00:05:21.520> circuit<00:05:22.000> there's<00:05:22.509> still<00:05:22.690> wire

00:05:22.860 --> 00:05:22.870 
and still circuit there's still wire

00:05:22.870 --> 00:05:24.930 
and still circuit there's still wire
them<00:05:23.110> together<00:05:23.289> with<00:05:24.159> the<00:05:24.250> harness<00:05:24.460> like<00:05:24.729> this

00:05:24.930 --> 00:05:24.940 
them together with the harness like this

00:05:24.940 --> 00:05:28.110 
them together with the harness like this
or<00:05:25.180> do<00:05:25.300> some<00:05:25.479> soldering<00:05:26.020> yourself<00:05:27.000> so<00:05:28.000> these

00:05:28.110 --> 00:05:28.120 
or do some soldering yourself so these

00:05:28.120 --> 00:05:29.550 
or do some soldering yourself so these
are<00:05:28.330> really<00:05:28.509> sweet<00:05:28.840> I'm<00:05:28.990> really<00:05:29.229> happy<00:05:29.409> about

00:05:29.550 --> 00:05:29.560 
are really sweet I'm really happy about

00:05:29.560 --> 00:05:32.760 
are really sweet I'm really happy about
these<00:05:29.979> I<00:05:30.009> got<00:05:30.310> the<00:05:30.520> idea<00:05:30.819> from<00:05:31.080> from<00:05:32.080> just

00:05:32.760 --> 00:05:32.770 
these I got the idea from from just

00:05:32.770 --> 00:05:34.379 
these I got the idea from from just
looking<00:05:33.039> at<00:05:33.310> YouTube<00:05:33.610> videos<00:05:33.969> on<00:05:34.210> other

00:05:34.379 --> 00:05:34.389 
looking at YouTube videos on other

00:05:34.389 --> 00:05:36.149 
looking at YouTube videos on other
people<00:05:34.750> who<00:05:34.870> have<00:05:34.960> done<00:05:35.110> some<00:05:35.349> custom

00:05:36.149 --> 00:05:36.159 
people who have done some custom

00:05:36.159 --> 00:05:38.279 
people who have done some custom
lighting<00:05:36.400> for<00:05:36.639> their<00:05:36.789> safes<00:05:37.120> it's<00:05:37.960> way

00:05:38.279 --> 00:05:38.289 
lighting for their safes it's way

00:05:38.289 --> 00:05:39.870 
lighting for their safes it's way
cheaper<00:05:38.319> than<00:05:38.889> buying<00:05:39.219> what<00:05:39.460> they<00:05:39.610> have<00:05:39.729> out

00:05:39.870 --> 00:05:39.880 
cheaper than buying what they have out

00:05:39.880 --> 00:05:41.790 
cheaper than buying what they have out
there<00:05:39.909> on<00:05:40.150> the<00:05:40.270> market<00:05:40.719> and<00:05:40.930> I<00:05:41.529> think<00:05:41.560> the

00:05:41.790 --> 00:05:41.800 
there on the market and I think the

00:05:41.800 --> 00:05:43.850 
there on the market and I think the
results<00:05:42.250> are<00:05:42.340> nicer<00:05:42.729> too

00:05:43.850 --> 00:05:43.860 
results are nicer too

00:05:43.860 --> 00:05:46.170 
results are nicer too
anyways<00:05:44.860> I<00:05:44.889> could<00:05:45.219> see<00:05:45.400> how<00:05:45.580> well<00:05:45.789> that<00:05:45.819> lights

00:05:46.170 --> 00:05:46.180 
anyways I could see how well that lights

00:05:46.180 --> 00:05:51.269 
anyways I could see how well that lights
up<00:05:46.419> other<00:05:47.139> thing<00:05:47.409> I<00:05:47.529> did<00:05:48.150> was<00:05:49.150> I<00:05:50.009> added<00:05:51.009> some

00:05:51.269 --> 00:05:51.279 
up other thing I did was I added some

00:05:51.279 --> 00:05:54.899 
up other thing I did was I added some
shelves<00:05:51.789> and<00:05:52.659> I<00:05:53.620> was<00:05:53.770> gonna<00:05:53.979> buy<00:05:54.340> some<00:05:54.699> from

00:05:54.899 --> 00:05:54.909 
shelves and I was gonna buy some from

00:05:54.909 --> 00:05:56.249 
shelves and I was gonna buy some from
the<00:05:55.029> company<00:05:55.449> the<00:05:55.599> company<00:05:55.629> is<00:05:56.110> actually

00:05:56.249 --> 00:05:56.259 
the company the company is actually

00:05:56.259 --> 00:06:00.360 
the company the company is actually
local<00:05:56.949> here<00:05:57.250> and<00:05:58.409> so<00:05:59.409> I<00:05:59.440> called<00:05:59.770> them<00:05:59.889> up<00:06:00.069> I<00:06:00.250> was

00:06:00.360 --> 00:06:00.370 
local here and so I called them up I was

00:06:00.370 --> 00:06:01.920 
local here and so I called them up I was
going<00:06:00.580> to<00:06:00.669> just<00:06:00.819> go<00:06:00.940> pick<00:06:01.150> up<00:06:01.210> some<00:06:01.569> shelves

00:06:01.920 --> 00:06:01.930 
going to just go pick up some shelves

00:06:01.930 --> 00:06:04.860 
going to just go pick up some shelves
from<00:06:02.199> them<00:06:02.349> but<00:06:03.129> they<00:06:03.279> wanted<00:06:03.520> to<00:06:03.610> charge<00:06:03.870> $20

00:06:04.860 --> 00:06:04.870 
from them but they wanted to charge $20

00:06:04.870 --> 00:06:08.519 
from them but they wanted to charge $20
for<00:06:05.199> a<00:06:05.620> small<00:06:05.949> shelf<00:06:06.310> and<00:06:06.690> 30<00:06:07.690> for<00:06:08.050> a<00:06:08.080> big<00:06:08.319> one

00:06:08.519 --> 00:06:08.529 
for a small shelf and 30 for a big one

00:06:08.529 --> 00:06:11.939 
for a small shelf and 30 for a big one
so<00:06:09.370> I<00:06:09.639> just<00:06:09.940> made<00:06:10.180> my<00:06:10.389> own<00:06:10.590> sure<00:06:11.590> they<00:06:11.800> look

00:06:11.939 --> 00:06:11.949 
so I just made my own sure they look

00:06:11.949 --> 00:06:13.740 
so I just made my own sure they look
slightly<00:06:12.340> different<00:06:12.610> I<00:06:13.180> just<00:06:13.389> went<00:06:13.629> and

00:06:13.740 --> 00:06:13.750 
slightly different I just went and

00:06:13.750 --> 00:06:18.570 
slightly different I just went and
bought<00:06:13.810> some<00:06:13.990> felt<00:06:14.590> and<00:06:16.469> contact<00:06:17.469> cement<00:06:17.889> that

00:06:18.570 --> 00:06:18.580 
bought some felt and contact cement that

00:06:18.580 --> 00:06:20.760 
bought some felt and contact cement that
was<00:06:18.759> designed<00:06:19.150> to<00:06:19.389> attach<00:06:19.659> felt<00:06:20.050> or<00:06:20.259> fabric<00:06:20.620> to

00:06:20.760 --> 00:06:20.770 
was designed to attach felt or fabric to

00:06:20.770 --> 00:06:22.769 
was designed to attach felt or fabric to
wood<00:06:20.979> I<00:06:21.250> had<00:06:21.639> the<00:06:21.759> wood<00:06:21.940> scraps<00:06:22.270> laying<00:06:22.509> around

00:06:22.769 --> 00:06:22.779 
wood I had the wood scraps laying around

00:06:22.779 --> 00:06:26.939 
wood I had the wood scraps laying around
so<00:06:23.560> I<00:06:24.000> sprayed<00:06:25.000> the<00:06:25.330> adhesive<00:06:25.870> on<00:06:26.020> the<00:06:26.590> felt

00:06:26.939 --> 00:06:26.949 
so I sprayed the adhesive on the felt

00:06:26.949 --> 00:06:29.279 
so I sprayed the adhesive on the felt
and<00:06:27.190> on<00:06:27.909> the<00:06:28.029> wood<00:06:28.210> and<00:06:28.479> put<00:06:29.050> them<00:06:29.139> together

00:06:29.279 --> 00:06:29.289 
and on the wood and put them together

00:06:29.289 --> 00:06:32.510 
and on the wood and put them together
and<00:06:29.740> you<00:06:30.490> know<00:06:30.610> what<00:06:30.789> turned<00:06:31.210> out<00:06:31.389> pretty<00:06:31.750> well

00:06:32.510 --> 00:06:32.520 
and you know what turned out pretty well

00:06:32.520 --> 00:06:35.219 
and you know what turned out pretty well
this<00:06:33.520> shelf<00:06:33.849> is<00:06:34.000> actually<00:06:34.419> stronger<00:06:34.990> than<00:06:35.050> the

00:06:35.219 --> 00:06:35.229 
this shelf is actually stronger than the

00:06:35.229 --> 00:06:37.230 
this shelf is actually stronger than the
stock<00:06:35.620> shelf<00:06:35.949> that<00:06:36.099> came<00:06:36.279> with<00:06:36.460> it

00:06:37.230 --> 00:06:37.240 
stock shelf that came with it

00:06:37.240 --> 00:06:39.360 
stock shelf that came with it

00:06:39.360 --> 00:06:39.370 
so I can put quite a bit of weight up

00:06:39.370 --> 00:06:43.700 
so I can put quite a bit of weight up
