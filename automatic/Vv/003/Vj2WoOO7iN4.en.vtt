00:00:11.210 --> 00:00:16.560
 Hello everyone and welcome to the lesson 

00:00:13.980 --> 00:00:20.130
 of the node cycle dedicated to the node 

00:00:16.560 --> 00:00:21.689
 spoken and the spoken node can have 

00:00:20.130 --> 00:00:26.279
 multiple uses however mainly 

00:00:21.689 --> 00:00:28.769
 you do it when you need it when 

00:00:26.279 --> 00:00:30.900
 we need to tie a rope to a 

00:00:28.769 --> 00:00:33.450
 rigid support as can be a pipe 

00:00:30.900 --> 00:00:36.180
 with in this case he used a 

00:00:33.450 --> 00:00:39.180
 broomstick because I can't find myself 

00:00:36.180 --> 00:00:40.980
 unfortunately in a place where you can 

00:00:39.180 --> 00:00:42.210
 perform a sail where you can 

00:00:40.980 --> 00:00:44.370
 practice sailing sail 

00:00:42.210 --> 00:00:47.180
 if 9 I would have shown it with pleasure on 

00:00:44.370 --> 00:00:50.489
 a sailboat directly though 

00:00:47.180 --> 00:00:53.219
 we must be content with this but 

00:00:50.489 --> 00:00:55.050
 explanation will be more than for the 

00:00:53.219 --> 00:00:59.250
 explanation will be more than enough 

00:00:55.050 --> 00:01:01.620
 as you can see we need to tie 

00:00:59.250 --> 00:01:04.350
 a top to a pipe we can use 

00:01:01.620 --> 00:01:09.210
 this node is the spoken node however 

00:01:04.350 --> 00:01:12.000
 in fact, a peculiarity lies where it must 

00:01:09.210 --> 00:01:14.790
 to stay that is st have given and effective 

00:01:12.000 --> 00:01:18.330
 only when there is tension like this 

00:01:14.790 --> 00:01:21.000
 case if the voltage fails as 

00:01:18.330 --> 00:01:24.119
 I'm showing you now you see that 

00:01:21.000 --> 00:01:29.250
 the knot then unties very easily 

00:01:24.119 --> 00:01:33.000
 enough that it happens to this and it is already 

00:01:29.250 --> 00:01:35.909
 joint then I recommend you check 

00:01:33.000 --> 00:01:38.220
 that the summit tied to a support 

00:01:35.909 --> 00:01:41.670
 rigid with a spoken node is always in 

00:01:38.220 --> 00:01:44.909
 tension if not untied let us see how 

00:01:41.670 --> 00:01:48.390
 run it with the top we pass under the 

00:01:44.909 --> 00:01:51.750
 rigid support and let it pass 

00:01:48.390 --> 00:01:54.299
 behind the outside as you see I have it 

00:01:51.750 --> 00:01:55.740
 made to pass outside the top that 

00:01:54.299 --> 00:01:58.920
 I just passed under the 

00:01:55.740 --> 00:02:01.229
 support originate with this capodici but 

00:01:58.920 --> 00:02:03.450
 that remains we go back behind the 

00:02:01.229 --> 00:02:05.759
 stiff support and this time instead of 

00:02:03.450 --> 00:02:08.819
 turn outside as it would be here 

00:02:05.759 --> 00:02:10.500
 we turn inside 

00:02:08.819 --> 00:02:11.470
 we enter this ring that we are 

00:02:10.500 --> 00:02:16.130
 format 

00:02:11.470 --> 00:02:19.220
 we tighten and the spoken node is ready 

00:02:16.130 --> 00:02:21.290
 to understand that the spoken node executed 

00:02:19.220 --> 00:02:24.170
 correctly you have to verify that vi 

00:02:21.290 --> 00:02:27.050
 are two top pieces cut from 

00:02:24.170 --> 00:02:32.510
 this piece of top here diagonally 

00:02:27.050 --> 00:02:35.060
 let's see it again with col 

00:02:32.510 --> 00:02:40.989
 piece dc but we pass under the support 

00:02:35.060 --> 00:02:44.480
 stiff we pass to the outside we return 

00:02:40.989 --> 00:02:47.120
 below and this time we bring in the 

00:02:44.480 --> 00:02:49.209
 cim head inside 

00:02:47.120 --> 00:02:52.100
 we verify that it is done correctly 

00:02:49.209 --> 00:02:53.560
 two pieces of top cut from one piece 

00:02:52.100 --> 00:02:56.470
 top diagonally 

00:02:53.560 --> 00:03:02.000
 the spoken node can be executed 

00:02:56.470 --> 00:03:03.920
 also on a rigid support with a head 

00:03:02.000 --> 00:03:06.470
 free such as can be a 

00:03:03.920 --> 00:03:08.120
 mooring pole on the pier and in this 

00:03:06.470 --> 00:03:09.700
 case it can be done in another way 

00:03:08.120 --> 00:03:15.080
 even faster 

00:03:09.700 --> 00:03:18.980
 you can make a ring like this 

00:03:15.080 --> 00:03:20.780
 in case you make another one like that 

00:03:18.980 --> 00:03:23.620
 that you did before and the second that 

00:03:20.780 --> 00:03:26.180
 you did put it under the other 

00:03:23.620 --> 00:03:29.829
 I'll show you this with mine 

00:03:26.180 --> 00:03:33.130
 arm is a knot that is also spoken 

00:03:29.829 --> 00:03:33.130
 as you see
