00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.430
 yes, my people today really one 

00:00:02.909 --> 00:00:09.870
 long imagine and small self-ignition 

00:00:05.430 --> 00:00:17.550
 Her favorite plant has four channels and 

00:00:09.870 --> 00:00:20.039
 all output of 15 volts and yes me 

00:00:17.550 --> 00:00:23.519
 I explain now as ignition system 

00:00:20.039 --> 00:00:25.080
 works so well and so as well 

00:00:23.519 --> 00:00:27.269
 first the ignition system here a plug 

00:00:25.080 --> 00:00:29.869
 with an output of 15 wanted as already 

00:00:27.269 --> 00:00:32.610
 said the plug into the socket 

00:00:29.869 --> 00:00:37.020
 then the current flows here the yellow 

00:00:32.610 --> 00:00:40.020
 box purely first to the main switch of 

00:00:37.020 --> 00:00:43.320
 advantage the stream here on all four 

00:00:40.020 --> 00:00:45.660
 channels and therefore a house card 

00:00:43.320 --> 00:00:49.039
 press down with it now at all 

00:00:45.660 --> 00:00:52.219
 Here is power and then you can 

00:00:49.039 --> 00:00:54.660
 the current for the individual channels then 

00:00:52.219 --> 00:00:57.149
 forward again by then the 

00:00:54.660 --> 00:01:01.020
 small crapware suppresses everything 

00:00:57.149 --> 00:01:02.460
 ring buttons and yes if you like me 

00:01:01.020 --> 00:01:03.090
 have now connected a channel that 

00:01:02.460 --> 00:01:06.840
 is this one 

00:01:03.090 --> 00:01:09.119
 if you press the button then the will 

00:01:06.840 --> 00:01:12.960
 Stream reverberates through the red-white cable 

00:01:09.119 --> 00:01:16.619
 forwarded here until after before where 

00:01:12.960 --> 00:01:19.549
 I bring a little appeal from there 

00:01:16.619 --> 00:01:22.320
 electricity then such a small piece 

00:01:19.549 --> 00:01:25.920
 Steel wool to glow 

00:01:22.320 --> 00:01:27.689
 I'm a bit bigger here and yes with me 

00:01:25.920 --> 00:01:30.360
 which one can then nonsense string or 

00:01:27.689 --> 00:01:31.979
 I'll light something like that now I'll be short 

00:01:30.360 --> 00:01:38.729
 plug it in and show us 

00:01:31.979 --> 00:01:45.070
 facts and looks like that 

00:01:38.729 --> 00:01:48.700
 Here we have only first time out 

00:01:45.070 --> 00:01:53.350
 times activate the main switch then 

00:01:48.700 --> 00:01:54.430
 and then the channel switch and like you 

00:01:53.350 --> 00:01:58.869
 see he is about to start 

00:01:54.430 --> 00:02:01.530
 the wire is about to bloom and some sparks 

00:01:58.869 --> 00:02:06.009
 arise and then you get 

00:02:01.530 --> 00:02:07.960
 pretty good purpose at first, too 

00:02:06.009 --> 00:02:08.830
 a little video for today i hope so 

00:02:07.960 --> 00:02:12.120
 you liked it 

00:02:08.830 --> 00:02:16.980
 if so could let them off and or 

00:02:12.120 --> 00:02:16.980
 then until the next video
