yes exactly well whatever you want to

00:02:55.630 --> 00:02:56.970 
yes exactly well whatever you want to
call<00:02:55.750> it<00:02:55.900> it's<00:02:56.050> one<00:02:56.260> of<00:02:56.350> the<00:02:56.470> world's<00:02:56.830> most

call it it's one of the world's most
advanced<00:02:57.700> materials<00:02:58.330> I<00:02:58.630> mean<00:02:59.230> one<00:02:59.380> thing<00:02:59.560> that

00:02:59.670 --> 00:02:59.680 
advanced materials I mean one thing that

00:02:59.680 --> 00:03:01.020 
advanced materials I mean one thing that
strikes<00:02:59.830> me<00:02:59.950> about<00:03:00.070> this<00:03:00.340> is<00:03:00.490> not<00:03:00.610> only<00:03:00.670> is<00:03:00.940> it

00:03:01.020 --> 00:03:01.030 
strikes me about this is not only is it

00:03:01.030 --> 00:03:02.910 
strikes me about this is not only is it
very<00:03:01.060> very<00:03:01.420> light<00:03:01.660> it's<00:03:01.930> extremely<00:03:02.530> thin<00:03:02.740> I

00:03:02.910 --> 00:03:02.920 
very very light it's extremely thin I

00:03:02.920 --> 00:03:04.440 
very very light it's extremely thin I
mean<00:03:03.040> is<00:03:03.160> that<00:03:03.190> is<00:03:03.550> this<00:03:03.790> the<00:03:03.850> thickness<00:03:04.300> of

00:03:04.440 --> 00:03:04.450 
mean is that is this the thickness of

00:03:04.450 --> 00:03:05.940 
mean is that is this the thickness of
the<00:03:04.600> fuselage<00:03:05.080> of<00:03:05.110> the<00:03:05.470> plane<00:03:05.560> yeah

00:03:05.940 --> 00:03:05.950 
the fuselage of the plane yeah

00:03:05.950 --> 00:03:07.650 
the fuselage of the plane yeah
absolutely<00:03:06.160> it's<00:03:06.670> almost<00:03:06.970> like<00:03:07.180> Blue<00:03:07.390> Gene

00:03:07.650 --> 00:03:07.660 
absolutely it's almost like Blue Gene

00:03:07.660 --> 00:03:10.140 
absolutely it's almost like Blue Gene
material<00:03:08.200> this<00:03:08.770> rod<00:03:09.040> is<00:03:09.070> that's<00:03:09.490> the<00:03:09.670> same<00:03:09.910> rod

00:03:10.140 --> 00:03:10.150 
material this rod is that's the same rod

00:03:10.150 --> 00:03:12.420 
material this rod is that's the same rod
that<00:03:10.390> you<00:03:10.510> use<00:03:10.780> in<00:03:11.080> your<00:03:11.110> tents<00:03:11.650> that's<00:03:12.250> what

00:03:12.420 --> 00:03:12.430 
that you use in your tents that's what

00:03:12.430 --> 00:03:14.550 
that you use in your tents that's what
this<00:03:12.550> material<00:03:12.760> is<00:03:13.210> here<00:03:13.540> so<00:03:13.840> it's<00:03:14.260> a<00:03:14.380> solid

00:03:14.550 --> 00:03:14.560 
this material is here so it's a solid

00:03:14.560 --> 00:03:16.560 
this material is here so it's a solid
and<00:03:14.980> this<00:03:15.220> and<00:03:15.550> this<00:03:15.700> other<00:03:15.880> stuff<00:03:16.210> is<00:03:16.360> more

00:03:16.560 --> 00:03:16.570 
and this and this other stuff is more

00:03:16.570 --> 00:03:18.450 
and this and this other stuff is more
like<00:03:16.750> a<00:03:16.780> piece<00:03:17.200> of<00:03:17.230> cloth<00:03:17.410> a<00:03:17.770> very<00:03:17.980> very<00:03:18.250> tough

00:03:18.450 --> 00:03:18.460 
like a piece of cloth a very very tough

00:03:18.460 --> 00:03:19.260 
like a piece of cloth a very very tough
piece<00:03:18.730> of<00:03:18.760> cloth

00:03:19.260 --> 00:03:19.270 
piece of cloth

00:03:19.270 --> 00:03:22.290 
piece of cloth
yes<00:03:19.420> exactly<00:03:19.660> a<00:03:20.200> piece<00:03:20.710> of<00:03:20.920> cloth<00:03:21.160> so<00:03:21.610> tough<00:03:21.970> in

00:03:22.290 --> 00:03:22.300 
yes exactly a piece of cloth so tough in

00:03:22.300 --> 00:03:24.750 
yes exactly a piece of cloth so tough in
fact<00:03:22.570> they've<00:03:23.050> already<00:03:23.290> made<00:03:23.890> a<00:03:23.950> plane<00:03:24.370> out<00:03:24.400> of

00:03:24.750 --> 00:03:24.760 
fact they've already made a plane out of

00:03:24.760 --> 00:03:29.280 
fact they've already made a plane out of
it<00:03:25.080> this<00:03:26.080> is<00:03:26.140> the<00:03:26.530> prototype<00:03:27.060> x-48b<00:03:28.060> as<00:03:28.690> you

00:03:29.280 --> 00:03:29.290 
it this is the prototype x-48b as you

00:03:29.290 --> 00:03:30.870 
it this is the prototype x-48b as you
can<00:03:29.440> see<00:03:29.590> it's<00:03:29.800> not<00:03:29.920> just<00:03:30.220> lighter<00:03:30.520> than

00:03:30.870 --> 00:03:30.880 
can see it's not just lighter than

00:03:30.880 --> 00:03:33.270 
can see it's not just lighter than
existing<00:03:31.330> passenger<00:03:31.630> planes<00:03:32.110> it's<00:03:32.980> a<00:03:33.070> whole

00:03:33.270 --> 00:03:33.280 
existing passenger planes it's a whole

00:03:33.280 --> 00:03:35.550 
existing passenger planes it's a whole
lot<00:03:33.490> sleeker<00:03:33.880> too<00:03:34.360> so<00:03:35.020> the<00:03:35.230> difference

00:03:35.550 --> 00:03:35.560 
lot sleeker too so the difference

00:03:35.560 --> 00:03:37.200 
lot sleeker too so the difference
between<00:03:35.740> the<00:03:36.010> tube<00:03:36.190> and<00:03:36.400> wing<00:03:36.550> and<00:03:36.820> the<00:03:36.880> hybrid

00:03:37.200 --> 00:03:37.210 
between the tube and wing and the hybrid

00:03:37.210 --> 00:03:38.640 
between the tube and wing and the hybrid
wing<00:03:37.360> body<00:03:37.390> is<00:03:37.780> the<00:03:37.900> blending<00:03:38.440> of<00:03:38.560> the

00:03:38.640 --> 00:03:38.650 
wing body is the blending of the

00:03:38.650 --> 00:03:41.880 
wing body is the blending of the
fuselage<00:03:39.160> and<00:03:39.490> the<00:03:39.580> wings<00:03:39.670> and<00:03:40.240> we<00:03:40.990> get<00:03:41.140> a<00:03:41.170> much

00:03:41.880 --> 00:03:41.890 
fuselage and the wings and we get a much

00:03:41.890 --> 00:03:44.880 
fuselage and the wings and we get a much
better<00:03:42.100> more<00:03:42.820> efficient<00:03:43.330> shape<00:03:43.570> in<00:03:44.080> doing<00:03:44.710> so

00:03:44.880 --> 00:03:44.890 
better more efficient shape in doing so

00:03:44.890 --> 00:03:47.130 
better more efficient shape in doing so

lift<00:04:01.330> means<00:04:01.870> you<00:04:02.080> need<00:04:02.230> less<00:04:02.470> fuel<00:04:02.770> to<00:04:02.800> lift<00:04:03.130> it
