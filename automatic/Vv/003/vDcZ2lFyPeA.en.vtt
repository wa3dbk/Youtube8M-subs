something is very versatile this is a
really<00:00:30.450> good<00:00:30.660> little<00:00:30.779> camera<00:00:31.200> now<00:00:31.559> it<00:00:31.680> shoots

00:00:31.909 --> 00:00:31.919 
really good little camera now it shoots

00:00:31.919 --> 00:00:33.350 
really good little camera now it shoots
an<00:00:32.040> SD<00:00:32.369> that<00:00:32.399> doesn't<00:00:32.910> mean<00:00:33.030> you're<00:00:33.180> going<00:00:33.270> to

00:00:33.350 --> 00:00:33.360 
an SD that doesn't mean you're going to

00:00:33.360 --> 00:00:36.260 
an SD that doesn't mean you're going to

00:01:17.510 --> 00:01:17.520 
pretty good in low-light now take a look

00:01:17.520 --> 00:01:18.739 
pretty good in low-light now take a look
at<00:01:17.639> the<00:01:17.729> lens<00:01:17.939> because<00:01:18.179> it's<00:01:18.329> not<00:01:18.539> your

00:01:18.739 --> 00:01:18.749 
at the lens because it's not your

00:01:18.749 --> 00:01:20.359 
at the lens because it's not your
average<00:01:18.899> lens<00:01:19.380> it's<00:01:19.530> actually<00:01:19.859> a<00:01:19.889> Schneider

00:01:20.359 --> 00:01:20.369 
average lens it's actually a Schneider

00:01:20.369 --> 00:01:23.569 
average lens it's actually a Schneider
lens<00:01:20.579> very<00:01:21.329> very<00:01:22.020> nice<00:01:22.200> it's<00:01:22.350> actually<00:01:22.679> a<00:01:22.710> 52<00:01:23.369> X

00:01:23.569 --> 00:01:23.579 
lens very very nice it's actually a 52 X

00:01:23.579 --> 00:01:25.819 
lens very very nice it's actually a 52 X
optical<00:01:23.850> zoom<00:01:24.179> so<00:01:24.420> you<00:01:24.509> can<00:01:24.659> really<00:01:25.139> zoom<00:01:25.590> this

00:01:25.819 --> 00:01:25.829 
optical zoom so you can really zoom this

00:01:25.829 --> 00:01:29.510 
optical zoom so you can really zoom this
thing<00:01:26.069> in<00:01:26.280> it's<00:01:26.969> actually<00:01:27.299> got<00:01:27.450> a<00:01:27.630> 65<00:01:28.259> X<00:01:28.619> using

00:01:29.510 --> 00:01:29.520 
thing in it's actually got a 65 X using

00:01:29.520 --> 00:01:31.129 
thing in it's actually got a 65 X using
intel<00:01:30.090> ism<00:01:30.389> which<00:01:30.539> is<00:01:30.659> kind<00:01:30.840> of<00:01:30.869> a<00:01:30.990> little

00:01:31.129 --> 00:01:31.139 
intel ism which is kind of a little

00:01:31.139 --> 00:01:33.169 
intel ism which is kind of a little
feature<00:01:31.350> in<00:01:31.530> here<00:01:31.679> and<00:01:31.889> it<00:01:32.069> goes<00:01:32.159> up<00:01:32.310> to<00:01:32.369> 1200<00:01:33.060> X

00:01:33.169 --> 00:01:33.179 
feature in here and it goes up to 1200 X

00:01:33.179 --> 00:01:35.270 
feature in here and it goes up to 1200 X
with<00:01:33.869> the<00:01:34.020> digital<00:01:34.409> zoom<00:01:34.469> now<00:01:34.799> it<00:01:34.979> shoots<00:01:35.159> at

00:01:35.270 --> 00:01:35.280 
with the digital zoom now it shoots at

00:01:35.280 --> 00:01:38.230 
with the digital zoom now it shoots at
720<00:01:35.729> by<00:01:35.850> 480<00:01:36.350> like<00:01:37.350> I<00:01:37.439> mentioned<00:01:37.679> before<00:01:37.709> in

00:03:44.110 --> 00:03:44.120 
directly off of it like I mentioned

00:03:44.120 --> 00:03:45.819 
directly off of it like I mentioned
earlier<00:03:44.239> your<00:03:44.870> batteries<00:03:45.200> right<00:03:45.349> here<00:03:45.620> this

00:03:45.819 --> 00:03:45.829 
earlier your batteries right here this

00:03:45.829 --> 00:03:49.479 
earlier your batteries right here this

00:03:52.449 --> 00:03:52.459 
that I was telling you about now this is

00:03:52.459 --> 00:03:53.830 
that I was telling you about now this is
a<00:03:52.489> Display<00:03:52.940> button<00:03:52.970> basically<00:03:53.389> just<00:03:53.690> turns

a Display button basically just turns
off<00:03:53.959> your<00:03:54.049> display<00:03:54.319> for<00:03:54.440> not<00:03:54.560> using<00:03:54.680> it<00:03:54.889> this

actually is also for the display but

00:03:57.680 --> 00:03:59.349 
actually is also for the display but
basically<00:03:57.980> it<00:03:58.130> does<00:03:58.310> depending<00:03:59.120> on<00:03:59.180> the<00:03:59.239> type

00:03:59.349 --> 00:03:59.359 
basically it does depending on the type

00:03:59.359 --> 00:04:00.879 
basically it does depending on the type
of<00:03:59.389> light<00:03:59.660> you<00:03:59.780> are<00:03:59.900> outside<00:04:00.260> it<00:04:00.470> adjusts<00:04:00.829> the
