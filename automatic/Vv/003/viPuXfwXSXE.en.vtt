00:00:31.040 --> 00:00:31.050 
your signs on the second layer like

00:00:31.050 --> 00:00:34.220 
your signs on the second layer like
shown<00:00:32.030> go<00:00:33.030> down<00:00:33.180> another<00:00:33.480> layer<00:00:33.719> and<00:00:33.899> place

00:00:34.220 --> 00:00:34.230 
shown go down another layer and place

shown go down another layer and place
the<00:00:34.410> signs<00:00:34.680> again<00:00:36.290> and<00:00:37.290> make<00:00:38.219> sure<00:00:38.250> there's<00:00:38.640> at

00:00:38.750 --> 00:00:38.760 
the signs again and make sure there's at

00:00:38.760 --> 00:00:40.340 
the signs again and make sure there's at
least<00:00:38.790> three<00:00:39.239> blocks<00:00:39.450> under<00:00:39.750> this<00:00:39.899> so<00:00:40.170> let's

00:00:40.340 --> 00:00:40.350 
least three blocks under this so let's

00:00:40.350 --> 00:00:42.770 
least three blocks under this so let's
just<00:00:40.500> dig<00:00:40.680> three<00:00:40.920> under<00:00:41.100> here<00:00:41.280> and<00:00:41.480> so<00:00:42.480> that's

00:00:42.770 --> 00:00:42.780 
just dig three under here and so that's

00:00:42.780 --> 00:00:45.770 
just dig three under here and so that's
kind<00:00:42.960> of<00:00:42.989> cool<00:00:43.170> there<00:00:43.410> is<00:00:43.440> a<00:00:44.719> kind<00:00:45.719> of

00:00:45.770 --> 00:00:45.780 
kind of cool there is a kind of

00:00:45.780 --> 00:00:48.049 
kind of cool there is a kind of
secretive<00:00:46.379> thing<00:00:46.710> down<00:00:46.920> there<00:00:47.100> so<00:00:47.850> let's<00:00:48.000> go

00:00:48.049 --> 00:00:48.059 
secretive thing down there so let's go
