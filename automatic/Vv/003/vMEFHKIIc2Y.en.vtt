00:00:01.270 --> 00:00:08.790
 hi friends today I'm going to show you a 

00:00:04.569 --> 00:00:14.280
 tutorial on how to style your hair 

00:00:08.790 --> 00:00:17.630
 The first thing we will need will be 

00:00:14.280 --> 00:00:17.630
 with the crown 

00:00:19.610 --> 00:00:25.780
 a big dick like this one that 

00:00:23.120 --> 00:00:25.780
 take yes 

00:00:27.950 --> 00:00:31.270
 elastic bands 

00:00:36.530 --> 00:00:39.530
 already 

00:00:39.840 --> 00:00:44.030
 and our pon 

00:00:44.910 --> 00:00:49.830
 before starting you can show you a 

00:00:47.190 --> 00:00:52.820
 example of how it will be more or less 

00:00:49.830 --> 00:00:52.820
 disheveled 

00:00:54.520 --> 00:00:58.980
 more or less it will be like this 

00:00:59.950 --> 00:01:06.479
 good let's start 

00:01:03.960 --> 00:01:09.799
 let's take our pony we're going to 

00:01:06.479 --> 00:01:09.799
 brush your hair well 

00:01:10.940 --> 00:01:19.270
 As I'm already well brushed, we're going to 

00:01:14.200 --> 00:01:19.270
 brush back like this 

00:01:20.590 --> 00:01:24.560
 i 

00:01:22.250 --> 00:01:27.970
 let's take all the hair and we're going 

00:01:24.560 --> 00:01:27.970
 to screw 

00:01:31.640 --> 00:01:34.270
 or yes 

00:01:37.909 --> 00:01:41.320
 and we retire like this 

00:01:42.330 --> 00:01:51.820
 we will use our elastic band 

00:01:47.930 --> 00:01:51.820
 one of any color 

00:01:53.010 --> 00:01:56.960
 how are we going to see 

00:01:58.560 --> 00:02:03.299
 and if you realize they are going to say 

00:02:01.110 --> 00:02:04.820
 but you see the elastic band and you can see it 

00:02:03.299 --> 00:02:06.970
 ugly 

00:02:04.820 --> 00:02:09.160
 no matter 

00:02:06.970 --> 00:02:11.330
 Well, that is going to be solved with the 

00:02:09.160 --> 00:02:14.630
 skewer and crown 

00:02:11.330 --> 00:02:16.310
 now comes a more fun part the 

00:02:14.630 --> 00:02:18.770
 decor 

00:02:16.310 --> 00:02:25.239
 we will do our pinche and we are going 

00:02:18.770 --> 00:02:25.239
 to put here covering the league and the tomato 

00:02:25.940 --> 00:02:32.360
 and then we go to sevilla this tuft 

00:02:28.540 --> 00:02:34.930
 it was big that is ideal like that 

00:02:32.360 --> 00:02:37.260
 bearing 

00:02:34.930 --> 00:02:40.799
 and I do not know if I lived dry 

00:02:37.260 --> 00:02:44.450
 and we will accommodate it like this if we can 

00:02:40.799 --> 00:02:44.450
 where are we going like this 

00:02:45.010 --> 00:02:49.170
 we arrange it on this side 

00:02:49.840 --> 00:02:54.640
 and now the other fun part with the 

00:02:52.750 --> 00:02:56.600
 cable to the crown 

00:02:54.640 --> 00:02:59.720
 we will place 

00:02:56.600 --> 00:03:02.210
 here the crown is going to crush a little 

00:02:59.720 --> 00:03:04.290
 this hair is why we're going to 

00:03:02.210 --> 00:03:08.090
 use 

00:03:04.290 --> 00:03:08.090
 then we're going to let go of the tail 

00:03:08.569 --> 00:03:17.160
 we get caught we must talk we go to 

00:03:12.739 --> 00:03:22.950
 do this with what a lot of attention 

00:03:17.160 --> 00:03:26.760
 we are going to occupy a pinche like those that 

00:03:22.950 --> 00:03:29.990
 we use on the hair of the hair but 

00:03:26.760 --> 00:03:29.990
 I wish more 

00:03:30.730 --> 00:03:34.500
 and I hope the same color 

00:03:35.000 --> 00:03:40.790
 the 5 you have the same color but 

00:03:37.790 --> 00:03:43.640
 kitchen and has degradation between white 

00:03:40.790 --> 00:03:46.330
 and blue thing that will combine it very well to 

00:03:43.640 --> 00:03:51.280
 the penalty of this for 

00:03:46.330 --> 00:03:54.400
 we take the tail and brush them 

00:03:51.280 --> 00:03:57.430
 we take all and we're going to screw it and 

00:03:54.400 --> 00:04:03.940
 let's make a tomato like what 

00:03:57.430 --> 00:04:06.040
 we did in the mill above 

00:04:03.940 --> 00:04:08.920
 This will have a little more 

00:04:06.040 --> 00:04:12.440
 complication since you have to give it more 

00:04:08.920 --> 00:04:15.620
 turns round and round 

00:04:12.440 --> 00:04:18.580
 When he is comfortable, we will take another 

00:04:15.620 --> 00:04:18.580
 elastic band 

00:04:19.450 --> 00:04:23.979
 for 

00:04:20.870 --> 00:04:23.979
 fastened it 

00:04:25.930 --> 00:04:32.350
 so that not noticed knows that no 

00:04:29.350 --> 00:04:37.100
 to be a bit like I care for something 

00:04:32.350 --> 00:04:39.750
 we have our new prick 

00:04:37.100 --> 00:04:42.240
 we put it here 

00:04:39.750 --> 00:04:43.900
 and the rest of the lock is going to 

00:04:42.240 --> 00:04:46.419
 brush 

00:04:43.900 --> 00:04:49.800
 If you want to see it, we leave it behind you 

00:04:46.419 --> 00:04:52.849
 we give a curve to this side 

00:04:49.800 --> 00:04:55.819
 or we arrange it as we want 

00:04:52.849 --> 00:05:00.330
 if you put a little bit of this tuft where 

00:04:55.819 --> 00:05:05.509
 they have to brush and rearrange 

00:05:00.330 --> 00:05:05.509
 and ready our moth is ready 

00:05:05.540 --> 00:05:10.570
 I do not know if they liked it but I hope that they 

00:05:08.990 --> 00:05:16.150
 I liked it 

00:05:10.570 --> 00:05:16.150
 thank you very much friends chau chau
