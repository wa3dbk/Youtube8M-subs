00:00:05.069 --> 00:00:12.059
 terry here in my channel home 

00:00:07.830 --> 00:00:13.469
 background a solo 107 to five faith 

00:00:12.059 --> 00:00:14.759
 I on the map slums that I always 

00:00:13.469 --> 00:00:17.340
 six against six domination he came 

00:00:14.759 --> 00:00:19.289
 Show him 94 with silencer 

00:00:17.340 --> 00:00:22.320

00:00:19.289 --> 00:00:24.150
 She always wanted to say that solo 

00:00:22.320 --> 00:00:25.560
 107 kills is not so blatant though 

00:00:24.150 --> 00:00:27.330
 I think six against six is all in 

00:00:25.560 --> 00:00:29.220
 order that a son of a bitch in the 

00:00:27.330 --> 00:00:30.689
 The lobby was still in its swarm at the end 

00:00:29.220 --> 00:00:32.369

00:00:30.689 --> 00:00:35.219
 reached through my orbital here 

00:00:32.369 --> 00:00:36.149
 that of impax corps yes but what can you do 

00:00:35.219 --> 00:00:37.350

00:00:40.469 --> 00:00:43.410
 because in estrich something always like that 

00:00:42.030 --> 00:00:45.059
 there are only a few alternations 

00:00:43.410 --> 00:00:46.559
 clear gameplay times, there's killstreaks 

00:00:45.059 --> 00:00:47.879

00:00:49.260 --> 00:00:52.949
 a game somehow the most bock 

00:00:50.449 --> 00:00:54.719

00:00:57.480 --> 00:01:01.710

00:02:22.800 --> 00:02:25.410
 Once gone regions without shit 

00:02:24.120 --> 00:02:26.160

 So to speak, the software is coming now 

00:03:22.829 --> 00:03:26.310
 to the hardcore overlap of hardcore 

00:03:24.989 --> 00:03:31.019
 loading is characterized by the 

00:03:26.310 --> 00:03:32.609
 community police after playing the 

00:03:31.019 --> 00:03:34.799
 community police looks like this 

00:03:32.609 --> 00:03:36.510
