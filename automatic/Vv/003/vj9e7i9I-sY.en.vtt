00:00:33.479 --> 00:00:33.489 
that it contrasts when we're making the

00:00:33.489 --> 00:00:36.720 
that it contrasts when we're making the
ink<00:00:33.699> pattern<00:00:34.480> on<00:00:34.660> our<00:00:34.930> votive<00:00:35.560> holder<00:00:35.829> so<00:00:36.610> the

first thing you do is I take one of the
inks<00:00:38.230> and<00:00:38.620> I<00:00:39.430> put<00:00:39.640> a<00:00:39.670> few<00:00:39.910> dots<00:00:40.800> sporadically

00:00:41.790 --> 00:00:41.800
