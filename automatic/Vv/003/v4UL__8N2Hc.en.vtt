hollowness to it doesn't have that

00:00:30.990 --> 00:00:33.830 
hollowness to it doesn't have that
sturdy<00:00:31.560> construction<00:00:31.769> like<00:00:32.460> the<00:00:32.610> HTC<00:00:33.420> One

00:00:33.830 --> 00:00:33.840 
sturdy construction like the HTC One

00:00:33.840 --> 00:00:36.260 
sturdy construction like the HTC One
it's<00:00:34.649> a<00:00:34.739> little<00:00:34.800> bit<00:00:34.950> more<00:00:35.100> pontem<00:00:35.579> to<00:00:35.969> smudge

00:00:36.260 --> 00:00:36.270 
it's a little bit more pontem to smudge

00:00:36.270 --> 00:00:38.330 
it's a little bit more pontem to smudge
the<00:00:36.540> specific<00:00:36.989> glossy<00:00:37.230> finish<00:00:37.739> but<00:00:37.920> the

00:00:39.889 --> 00:00:39.899 
difference the benefit and having the

00:00:39.899 --> 00:00:41.240 
difference the benefit and having the
facets<00:00:40.379> of<00:00:40.469> course<00:00:40.739> it<00:00:40.920> seemed<00:00:41.070> lighter

00:00:41.240 --> 00:00:41.250 
facets of course it seemed lighter

00:00:41.250 --> 00:00:42.889 
facets of course it seemed lighter
definitely<00:00:42.149> notice<00:00:42.360> the<00:00:42.450> difference<00:00:42.809> in

00:00:42.889 --> 00:00:42.899 
definitely notice the difference in

00:00:42.899 --> 00:00:45.580 
definitely notice the difference in
light<00:00:43.170> and<00:00:43.610> weight<00:00:44.610> between<00:00:44.789> the<00:00:45.059> two<00:00:45.239> of<00:00:45.420> the

00:00:52.069 --> 00:00:52.079 
heavier now in terms of size it's really

00:00:52.079 --> 00:00:54.529 
heavier now in terms of size it's really
impressive<00:00:52.379> what<00:00:52.890> LG<00:00:53.309> has<00:00:53.399> done<00:00:53.670> for<00:00:54.300> device

small 4.7 inch display HTC One they
manage<00:01:00.750> to<00:01:00.809> be<00:01:01.020> almost<00:01:01.410> identical<00:01:01.800> so<00:01:02.550> it

00:01:02.689 --> 00:01:02.699 
manage to be almost identical so it

00:01:02.699 --> 00:01:05.299 
manage to be almost identical so it
doesn't<00:01:03.000> feel<00:01:03.120> like<00:01:03.270> you're<00:01:03.390> holding<00:01:03.660> a<00:01:04.309> 5.2

doesn't feel like you're holding a 5.2

00:01:05.309 --> 00:01:07.280 
doesn't feel like you're holding a 5.2
inch<00:01:05.519> display<00:01:05.970> in<00:01:06.030> your<00:01:06.090> hands<00:01:06.360> with<00:01:06.540> LG<00:01:06.869> g2

00:01:07.280 --> 00:01:07.290 
inch display in your hands with LG g2

00:01:07.290 --> 00:01:09.500 
inch display in your hands with LG g2
it's<00:01:07.799> pretty<00:01:08.100> much<00:01:08.250> on<00:01:08.490> the<00:01:08.520> same<00:01:08.610> page<00:01:08.820> as<00:01:09.299> as

00:01:09.500 --> 00:01:09.510 
it's pretty much on the same page as as

00:01:09.510 --> 00:01:11.570 
it's pretty much on the same page as as
the<00:01:09.810> HTC<00:01:10.260> One<00:01:10.409> now<00:01:10.830> the<00:01:10.890> way<00:01:11.070> they<00:01:11.189> did<00:01:11.369> that's

00:01:11.570 --> 00:01:11.580 
the HTC One now the way they did that's

00:01:11.580 --> 00:01:13.460 
the HTC One now the way they did that's
because<00:01:11.970> they<00:01:12.119> manage<00:01:12.510> to<00:01:12.540> minimize<00:01:13.260> the

00:01:13.460 --> 00:01:13.470 
because they manage to minimize the

00:01:13.470 --> 00:01:16.249 
because they manage to minimize the
bezels<00:01:13.920> around<00:01:14.430> the<00:01:14.640> display<00:01:14.820> it's<00:01:15.750> a<00:01:15.840> bike<00:01:16.020> to

00:01:16.249 --> 00:01:16.259 
bezels around the display it's a bike to

00:01:16.259 --> 00:01:17.330 
bezels around the display it's a bike to
the<00:01:16.290> sky

00:01:17.330 --> 00:01:17.340 
the sky

00:01:17.340 --> 00:01:20.179 
the sky
so<00:01:17.969> if<00:01:18.030> we<00:01:18.119> look<00:01:18.149> closely<00:01:18.619> it's<00:01:19.619> kind<00:01:19.920> of<00:01:20.009> hard

00:01:20.179 --> 00:01:20.189 
so if we look closely it's kind of hard

00:01:20.189 --> 00:01:22.190 
so if we look closely it's kind of hard
to<00:01:20.280> see<00:01:20.490> but<00:01:20.640> you<00:01:20.820> see<00:01:21.090> a<00:01:21.119> bigger<00:01:21.600> gap<00:01:21.899> between

00:01:22.190 --> 00:01:22.200 
to see but you see a bigger gap between

00:01:22.200 --> 00:01:25.789 
to see but you see a bigger gap between
the<00:01:22.590> HTC<00:01:23.039> one<00:01:23.250> vs<00:01:23.640> the<00:01:23.909> LG<00:01:24.689> g2<00:01:24.899> when<00:01:25.560> you<00:01:25.649> have

00:01:25.789 --> 00:01:25.799 
the HTC one vs the LG g2 when you have

00:01:25.799 --> 00:01:27.709 
the HTC one vs the LG g2 when you have
it<00:01:25.920> in<00:01:25.979> both<00:01:26.159> sides<00:01:26.490> it<00:01:26.939> really<00:01:27.210> does<00:01:27.450> add<00:01:27.689> up

00:01:27.709 --> 00:01:27.719 
it in both sides it really does add up

00:01:27.719 --> 00:01:30.349 
it in both sides it really does add up
so<00:01:28.049> that's<00:01:28.170> why<00:01:28.409> it's<00:01:28.439> still<00:01:28.799> there<00:01:29.159> the<00:01:29.729> LG<00:01:30.179> g2

00:01:30.349 --> 00:01:30.359 
so that's why it's still there the LG g2

00:01:30.359 --> 00:01:33.679 
so that's why it's still there the LG g2
girls<00:01:30.899> test<00:01:31.740> wide<00:01:32.100> as<00:01:32.429> the<00:01:32.640> HTC<00:01:33.210> One<00:01:33.390> when<00:01:33.600> you

00:01:33.679 --> 00:01:33.689 
girls test wide as the HTC One when you

00:01:33.689 --> 00:01:36.529 
girls test wide as the HTC One when you
hold<00:01:33.840> in<00:01:34.020> the<00:01:34.140> hand<00:01:34.319> which<00:01:34.890> is<00:01:35.009> great<00:01:35.539> aside

00:01:36.529 --> 00:01:36.539 
hold in the hand which is great aside

00:01:36.539 --> 00:01:38.419 
hold in the hand which is great aside

the other thing here is just the

00:02:40.040 --> 00:02:42.520 
the other thing here is just the
processor<00:02:40.700> the<00:02:40.940> of<00:02:41.120> speeds<00:02:41.510> you<00:02:42.260> get<00:02:42.470> a

00:02:42.520 --> 00:02:42.530 
processor the of speeds you get a

00:02:42.530 --> 00:02:44.140 
processor the of speeds you get a
quad-core<00:02:42.770> processor<00:02:43.400> in<00:02:43.520> both<00:02:43.700> but<00:02:43.970> of

00:02:44.140 --> 00:02:44.150 
quad-core processor in both but of

00:02:44.150 --> 00:02:45.940 
quad-core processor in both but of
course<00:02:44.360> the<00:02:44.510> LG<00:02:44.720> g2<00:02:44.900> being<00:02:45.349> the<00:02:45.470> new<00:02:45.590> device
