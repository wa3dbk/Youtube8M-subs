00:00:33.440 --> 00:00:33.450 
yeah you know these systems are really

00:00:33.450 --> 00:00:35.680 
yeah you know these systems are really
good<00:00:33.750> at<00:00:33.899> going<00:00:34.020> a<00:00:34.200> really<00:00:34.410> wide<00:00:34.559> variety<00:00:34.770> of

different<00:00:43.559> kinds<00:00:43.890> of<00:00:43.980> basil<00:00:44.809> because<00:00:45.809> we

00:00:46.130 --> 00:00:46.140 
different kinds of basil because we

00:00:46.140 --> 00:00:48.680 
different kinds of basil because we
don't<00:00:46.350> use<00:00:46.650> any<00:00:47.129> chemicals<00:00:47.339> or<00:00:48.089> anything<00:00:48.480> else

pesticides or insecticides you can taste

00:00:55.350 --> 00:00:57.759 
pesticides or insecticides you can taste
that<00:00:55.470> you<00:00:55.739> can<00:00:55.890> eat<00:00:56.010> anything<00:00:56.309> from<00:00:56.579> the<00:00:56.730> farm

00:00:57.759 --> 00:00:57.769 
that you can eat anything from the farm

00:00:57.769 --> 00:01:00.319 
that you can eat anything from the farm
we<00:00:58.769> have<00:00:58.860> these<00:00:59.010> blue<00:00:59.339> and<00:00:59.519> yellow<00:00:59.610> traps<00:01:00.089> that

00:01:00.319 --> 00:01:00.329 
we have these blue and yellow traps that

00:01:00.329 --> 00:01:03.529 
we have these blue and yellow traps that
you<00:01:00.449> see<00:01:00.800> all<00:01:01.800> around<00:01:02.010> and<00:01:02.489> we<00:01:03.210> do<00:01:03.329> a<00:01:03.359> lot<00:01:03.510> of

00:01:03.529 --> 00:01:03.539 
you see all around and we do a lot of

00:01:03.539 --> 00:01:05.210 
you see all around and we do a lot of
companion<00:01:04.080> planting<00:01:04.440> which<00:01:04.739> is<00:01:04.860> basically

00:01:05.210 --> 00:01:05.220 
companion planting which is basically

00:01:05.220 --> 00:01:07.820 
companion planting which is basically
like<00:01:05.460> a<00:01:05.489> bio<00:01:05.729> fumigation<00:01:06.390> so<00:01:07.020> you<00:01:07.080> plant<00:01:07.649> very

00:01:07.820 --> 00:01:07.830 
like a bio fumigation so you plant very

00:01:07.830 --> 00:01:10.400 
like a bio fumigation so you plant very
strong<00:01:08.190> smelling<00:01:08.550> plants<00:01:09.000> in<00:01:09.179> between<00:01:10.140> other

00:01:10.400 --> 00:01:10.410 
strong smelling plants in between other

00:01:10.410 --> 00:01:13.070 
strong smelling plants in between other
plants<00:01:10.890> that<00:01:11.039> could<00:01:11.280> that<00:01:11.840> attract<00:01:12.840> certain

00:01:13.070 --> 00:01:13.080 
plants that could that attract certain

00:01:13.080 --> 00:01:15.859 
plants that could that attract certain
pests<00:01:13.619> but<00:01:14.580> it's<00:01:14.880> the<00:01:15.030> kind<00:01:15.240> of<00:01:15.390> thing<00:01:15.600> that

00:01:15.859 --> 00:01:15.869 
pests but it's the kind of thing that

00:01:15.869 --> 00:01:17.719 
pests but it's the kind of thing that
it's<00:01:16.229> not<00:01:16.410> like<00:01:16.649> if<00:01:16.890> you<00:01:16.979> have<00:01:17.070> a<00:01:17.100> problem<00:01:17.369> with

00:01:17.719 --> 00:01:17.729 
it's not like if you have a problem with

00:01:17.729 --> 00:01:19.279 
it's not like if you have a problem with
chemical<00:01:18.119> pesticides<00:01:18.630> to<00:01:18.750> just<00:01:18.929> spray<00:01:19.110> it<00:01:19.170> it

00:01:19.279 --> 00:01:19.289 
chemical pesticides to just spray it it

00:01:19.289 --> 00:01:21.200 
chemical pesticides to just spray it it
goes<00:01:19.410> away<00:01:19.590> the<00:01:19.740> next<00:01:19.860> day<00:01:19.979> it's<00:01:20.850> you<00:01:21.000> have<00:01:21.090> to

00:01:21.200 --> 00:01:21.210 
goes away the next day it's you have to

00:01:21.210 --> 00:01:23.600 
goes away the next day it's you have to
really<00:01:21.929> know<00:01:22.470> what<00:01:22.500> you're<00:01:22.950> planting<00:01:23.460> you

00:01:23.600 --> 00:01:23.610 
really know what you're planting you

00:01:23.610 --> 00:01:25.160 
really know what you're planting you
have<00:01:23.700> to<00:01:23.820> know<00:01:23.970> what<00:01:24.149> the<00:01:24.270> potentials<00:01:24.869> are<00:01:24.990> you

00:01:25.160 --> 00:01:25.170 
have to know what the potentials are you

00:01:25.170 --> 00:01:26.960 
have to know what the potentials are you
have<00:01:25.259> to<00:01:25.380> be<00:01:25.500> looking<00:01:25.770> out<00:01:25.890> for<00:01:25.950> them<00:01:26.369> you<00:01:26.850> need

00:01:26.960 --> 00:01:26.970 
have to be looking out for them you need

00:01:26.970 --> 00:01:28.940 
have to be looking out for them you need
to<00:01:27.090> catch<00:01:27.270> things<00:01:27.539> nice<00:01:27.780> and<00:01:28.020> early<00:01:28.200> you<00:01:28.800> also

00:01:28.940 --> 00:01:28.950 
to catch things nice and early you also

00:01:28.950 --> 00:01:30.859 
to catch things nice and early you also
don't<00:01:29.250> want<00:01:29.550> to<00:01:29.670> use<00:01:29.789> a<00:01:29.820> lot<00:01:30.119> of<00:01:30.149> biological

00:01:30.859 --> 00:01:30.869 
don't want to use a lot of biological

00:01:30.869 --> 00:01:33.109 
don't want to use a lot of biological
control<00:01:30.990> because<00:01:31.560> like<00:01:32.310> with<00:01:32.520> chemicals<00:01:33.000> or

00:01:33.109 --> 00:01:33.119

advantages you are both able to grow at

00:01:46.920 --> 00:01:49.309 
advantages you are both able to grow at
higher<00:01:47.160> density<00:01:47.729> and<00:01:47.880> a<00:01:48.450> faster<00:01:48.869> growth<00:01:49.080> rate

00:01:49.309 --> 00:01:49.319 
higher density and a faster growth rate

00:01:49.319 --> 00:01:50.749 
higher density and a faster growth rate

because of the controlled environment
because<00:01:51.479> you<00:01:51.509> control<00:01:52.910> the<00:01:53.910> water<00:01:54.090> quality

00:01:55.300 --> 00:01:55.310 
because you control the water quality

00:01:55.310 --> 00:01:58.999 
because you control the water quality
here<00:01:56.310> in<00:01:56.550> an<00:01:57.000> aquaponic<00:01:57.630> system<00:01:58.110> different

hydroponics aquaponics and you've

00:02:39.950 --> 00:02:41.740 
hydroponics aquaponics and you've
thought<00:02:39.980> is<00:02:40.790> good<00:02:41.060> for<00:02:41.330> extreme<00:02:41.720> environments

00:02:41.740 --> 00:02:41.750 
thought is good for extreme environments

00:02:41.750 --> 00:02:43.840 
thought is good for extreme environments
and<00:02:42.560> here<00:02:42.860> we<00:02:42.950> have<00:02:43.040> extreme<00:02:43.430> heat<00:02:43.640> in<00:02:43.670> the

and here we have extreme heat in the
summer<00:02:44.060> it's<00:02:44.420> quite<00:02:44.720> cold<00:02:44.930> in<00:02:45.140> the<00:02:45.230> winter

you're<00:02:46.130> controlling<00:02:46.550> the<00:02:46.760> environment<00:02:46.880> as

00:02:47.320 --> 00:02:47.330 
you're controlling the environment as

00:02:47.330 --> 00:02:49.120 
you're controlling the environment as
much<00:02:47.510> as<00:02:47.690> possible<00:02:47.870> I<00:02:48.440> mean<00:02:48.680> even<00:02:49.010> though

00:02:49.120 --> 00:02:49.130 
much as possible I mean even though

00:02:49.130 --> 00:02:51.160 
much as possible I mean even though
we're<00:02:49.370> not<00:02:49.490> really<00:02:49.730> that<00:02:50.270> controlled<00:02:50.810> I<00:02:50.990> mean

we're not really that controlled I mean

00:02:51.170 --> 00:02:53.860 
we're not really that controlled I mean
we<00:02:51.500> use<00:02:51.680> netting<00:02:52.190> for<00:02:52.490> our<00:02:52.730> greenhouses<00:02:53.420> but

00:02:53.860 --> 00:02:53.870 
we use netting for our greenhouses but

00:02:53.870 --> 00:02:59.290 
we use netting for our greenhouses but
we<00:02:54.410> plant<00:02:54.680> seasonally<00:02:57.880> so<00:02:58.880> you<00:02:58.970> can<00:02:59.120> imagine

00:02:59.290 --> 00:02:59.300 
we plant seasonally so you can imagine

00:02:59.300 --> 00:03:02.880 
we plant seasonally so you can imagine
that<00:02:59.600> this<00:02:59.780> would<00:02:59.960> work<00:03:00.170> in<00:03:01.720> western<00:03:02.720> desert

00:03:02.880 --> 00:03:02.890 
that this would work in western desert

hydroponics<00:03:35.790> gives<00:03:36.030> a<00:03:36.150> better<00:03:36.329> value<00:03:36.599> for

00:03:37.190 --> 00:03:37.200 
hydroponics gives a better value for

00:03:37.200 --> 00:03:39.380 
hydroponics gives a better value for
land<00:03:37.739> and<00:03:37.920> money<00:03:38.129> but<00:03:39.000> then<00:03:39.150> on<00:03:39.239> the<00:03:39.359> other

00:03:39.380 --> 00:03:39.390 
land and money but then on the other

00:03:39.390 --> 00:03:41.390 
land and money but then on the other
hand<00:03:39.540> it's<00:03:39.989> much<00:03:40.349> more<00:03:40.620> difficult<00:03:41.189> and<00:03:41.310> you

00:03:41.390 --> 00:03:41.400 
hand it's much more difficult and you

00:03:41.400 --> 00:03:43.940 
hand it's much more difficult and you
have<00:03:41.459> much<00:03:41.790> more<00:03:42.000> risk<00:03:42.349> and<00:03:43.349> so<00:03:43.560> it<00:03:43.709> is<00:03:43.799> high

00:03:43.940 --> 00:03:43.950 
have much more risk and so it is high

00:03:43.950 --> 00:03:46.459 
have much more risk and so it is high
risk<00:03:44.010> and<00:03:44.400> a<00:03:44.459> higher<00:03:44.579> return<00:03:44.790> and<00:03:45.200> most<00:03:46.200> people

00:03:46.459 --> 00:03:46.469 
risk and a higher return and most people

00:03:46.469 --> 00:03:48.559 
risk and a higher return and most people
don't<00:03:46.620> take<00:03:46.859> it<00:03:47.010> because<00:03:47.250> it<00:03:47.370> is<00:03:47.459> such<00:03:47.640> a<00:03:47.670> high

00:03:48.559 --> 00:03:48.569 
don't take it because it is such a high

00:03:48.569 --> 00:03:50.660 
don't take it because it is such a high
risk<00:03:48.989> investment<00:03:49.500> or<00:03:49.590> even<00:03:49.769> like<00:03:49.890> a<00:03:50.010> high

00:03:50.660 --> 00:03:50.670 
risk investment or even like a high

00:03:50.670 --> 00:03:52.069 
risk investment or even like a high
capital<00:03:51.060> investment<00:03:51.599> it<00:03:51.659> takes<00:03:51.810> a<00:03:51.870> lot<00:03:51.989> of

00:03:52.069 --> 00:03:52.079 
capital investment it takes a lot of

00:03:52.079 --> 00:04:02.030 
capital investment it takes a lot of
money<00:03:52.230> to<00:03:52.409> start<00:03:52.469> up<00:03:52.680> performing<00:03:59.299> use<00:04:01.040> this

00:04:02.030 --> 00:04:02.040 
money to start up performing use this

00:04:02.040 --> 00:04:08.690 
money to start up performing use this
here<00:04:02.370> and<00:04:03.180> place<00:04:03.900> it<00:04:04.079> and<00:04:06.769> and<00:04:07.769> so<00:04:08.159> this<00:04:08.459> this

00:04:08.690 --> 00:04:08.700 
here and place it and and so this this

00:04:08.700 --> 00:04:11.059 
here and place it and and so this this
is<00:04:08.760> the<00:04:08.939> transfer<00:04:09.629> from<00:04:09.810> and<00:04:10.769> being<00:04:10.980> a

00:04:11.059 --> 00:04:11.069 
is the transfer from and being a

00:04:11.069 --> 00:04:12.860 
is the transfer from and being a
seedling<00:04:11.459> and<00:04:11.639> then<00:04:12.000> into<00:04:12.299> the<00:04:12.389> hydroponic

00:04:12.860 --> 00:04:12.870 
seedling and then into the hydroponic

00:04:12.870 --> 00:04:15.319 
seedling and then into the hydroponic
system<00:04:13.169> in<00:04:13.650> the<00:04:13.769> first<00:04:13.980> stage<00:04:14.159> it's<00:04:14.400> 20<00:04:14.909> to<00:04:15.120> 30

00:04:15.319 --> 00:04:15.329 
system in the first stage it's 20 to 30

00:04:15.329 --> 00:04:19.009 
system in the first stage it's 20 to 30
days<00:04:15.979> and<00:04:16.979> so<00:04:17.389> they're<00:04:18.389> taking<00:04:18.570> that<00:04:18.780> about

00:04:19.009 --> 00:04:19.019 
days and so they're taking that about

00:04:19.019 --> 00:04:25.360 
days and so they're taking that about
besides<00:04:19.709> it's<00:04:20.519> like<00:04:20.669> touching<00:04:20.849> each<00:04:21.090> other

00:04:25.360 --> 00:04:25.370 

00:04:25.370 --> 00:04:27.860 

you<00:04:26.370> have<00:04:26.490> two<00:04:26.639> tables<00:04:27.030> kind<00:04:27.270> of<00:04:27.449> leaning<00:04:27.780> in

00:04:27.860 --> 00:04:27.870 
you have two tables kind of leaning in

00:04:27.870 --> 00:04:28.580 
you have two tables kind of leaning in
towards<00:04:27.990> each<00:04:28.229> other

00:04:28.580 --> 00:04:28.590 
towards each other

00:04:28.590 --> 00:04:30.830 
towards each other
and<00:04:28.680> this<00:04:29.310> is<00:04:29.460> basically<00:04:29.669> like<00:04:30.090> here<00:04:30.539> you<00:04:30.720> know

00:04:30.830 --> 00:04:30.840 
and this is basically like here you know

00:04:30.840 --> 00:04:32.390 
and this is basically like here you know
these<00:04:31.020> two<00:04:31.139> tables<00:04:31.440> coming<00:04:31.680> in<00:04:31.830> and<00:04:32.220> then<00:04:32.310> the

00:04:32.390 --> 00:04:32.400 
these two tables coming in and then the

00:04:32.400 --> 00:04:36.800 
these two tables coming in and then the
water<00:04:32.580> will<00:04:33.120> go<00:04:33.270> down<00:04:33.830> into<00:04:35.330> the<00:04:36.330> water<00:04:36.449> things

00:04:36.800 --> 00:04:36.810 
water will go down into the water things

00:04:36.810 --> 00:04:38.719 
water will go down into the water things
and<00:04:37.110> then<00:04:37.229> come<00:04:37.259> back<00:04:37.470> up<00:04:37.650> again<00:04:38.070> and<00:04:38.250> then<00:04:38.400> go

00:04:38.719 --> 00:04:38.729 
and then come back up again and then go

00:04:38.729 --> 00:04:39.350 
and then come back up again and then go
and

00:04:39.350 --> 00:04:39.360 
and

00:04:39.360 --> 00:04:45.890 
and
and<00:04:39.599> then<00:04:39.900> just<00:04:40.139> it<00:04:40.289> keeps<00:04:40.409> resetting<00:04:44.900> here

00:04:45.890 --> 00:04:45.900 
and then just it keeps resetting here

00:04:45.900 --> 00:04:48.409 
and then just it keeps resetting here
you<00:04:45.990> have<00:04:46.139> the<00:04:46.469> water<00:04:46.729> going<00:04:47.729> in<00:04:47.969> from<00:04:48.300> that

00:04:48.409 --> 00:04:48.419 
you have the water going in from that

00:04:48.419 --> 00:04:50.089 
you have the water going in from that
one<00:04:48.629> and<00:04:48.930> then<00:04:49.050> you<00:04:49.080> have<00:04:49.259> a<00:04:49.289> pump<00:04:49.560> inside<00:04:49.919> that

00:04:50.089 --> 00:04:50.099 
one and then you have a pump inside that

00:04:50.099 --> 00:04:52.100 
one and then you have a pump inside that
little<00:04:50.340> room<00:04:50.819> there<00:04:51.030> and<00:04:51.270> this<00:04:51.629> is<00:04:51.689> where<00:04:51.960> the

00:04:52.100 --> 00:04:52.110 
little room there and this is where the

00:04:52.110 --> 00:04:54.170 
little room there and this is where the
water<00:04:52.229> would<00:04:52.469> be<00:04:52.590> coming<00:04:52.770> out<00:04:52.949> back<00:04:53.819> from<00:04:54.060> the

00:04:54.170 --> 00:04:54.180 
water would be coming out back from the

00:04:54.180 --> 00:04:58.010 
water would be coming out back from the
system<00:04:55.280> and<00:04:56.280> as<00:04:56.520> that<00:04:56.759> light<00:04:57.419> reddish<00:04:57.780> color

00:04:58.010 --> 00:04:58.020 
system and as that light reddish color

00:04:58.020 --> 00:04:59.360 
system and as that light reddish color
because<00:04:58.500> of<00:04:58.530> the<00:04:58.620> nutrients<00:04:59.039> liver<00:04:59.159> and

00:04:59.360 --> 00:04:59.370 
because of the nutrients liver and

00:04:59.370 --> 00:05:00.619 
because of the nutrients liver and
that's<00:04:59.550> many<00:04:59.759> of<00:04:59.849> the<00:04:59.909> iron<00:05:00.180> that<00:05:00.330> gives<00:05:00.509> it

00:05:00.619 --> 00:05:00.629 
that's many of the iron that gives it

00:05:00.629 --> 00:05:03.140 
that's many of the iron that gives it
that<00:05:00.659> color<00:05:01.009> this<00:05:02.009> is<00:05:02.250> this<00:05:02.639> holds<00:05:02.939> about<00:05:03.000> a

00:05:03.140 --> 00:05:03.150 
that color this is this holds about a

00:05:03.150 --> 00:05:05.390 
that color this is this holds about a
hundred<00:05:03.719> thousand<00:05:04.080> liters<00:05:04.710> and<00:05:04.860> this<00:05:05.219> is

00:05:05.390 --> 00:05:05.400 
hundred thousand liters and this is

00:05:05.400 --> 00:05:07.790 
hundred thousand liters and this is
where<00:05:05.939> we<00:05:06.150> get<00:05:06.270> water<00:05:06.539> underground<00:05:07.409> water

00:05:07.790 --> 00:05:07.800 
where we get water underground water

00:05:07.800 --> 00:05:09.770 
where we get water underground water
we'll<00:05:08.490> put<00:05:08.699> it<00:05:08.789> in<00:05:08.879> here<00:05:08.939> at<00:05:09.300> the<00:05:09.389> reservoir

00:05:09.770 --> 00:05:09.780 
we'll put it in here at the reservoir

00:05:09.780 --> 00:05:11.570 
we'll put it in here at the reservoir
which<00:05:09.960> keeps<00:05:10.199> us<00:05:10.319> going<00:05:10.620> in<00:05:11.039> case<00:05:11.219> there's<00:05:11.460> any

00:05:11.570 --> 00:05:11.580 
which keeps us going in case there's any

00:05:11.580 --> 00:05:15.519 
which keeps us going in case there's any
problems<00:05:11.939> in<00:05:12.060> there<00:05:12.150> just<00:05:12.360> they<00:05:12.689> can't<00:05:12.900> get

00:05:15.519 --> 00:05:15.529 

00:05:15.529 --> 00:05:19.279 

this<00:05:16.529> is<00:05:16.740> then<00:05:16.949> kind<00:05:17.370> of<00:05:17.990> broken<00:05:18.990> into

00:05:19.279 --> 00:05:19.289 
this is then kind of broken into

00:05:19.289 --> 00:05:21.379 
this is then kind of broken into
different<00:05:20.159> chambers<00:05:20.580> and<00:05:21.000> every<00:05:21.180> single

00:05:21.379 --> 00:05:21.389 
different chambers and every single

00:05:21.389 --> 00:05:25.040 
different chambers and every single
chamber<00:05:22.099> then<00:05:23.099> feeds<00:05:23.969> a<00:05:24.240> different<00:05:24.659> area<00:05:24.840> of

00:05:25.040 --> 00:05:25.050 
chamber then feeds a different area of

00:05:25.050 --> 00:05:27.529 
chamber then feeds a different area of
the<00:05:25.169> park<00:05:25.439> so<00:05:25.919> the<00:05:26.099> younger<00:05:26.430> plants<00:05:27.240> will<00:05:27.389> get

00:05:27.529 --> 00:05:27.539 
the park so the younger plants will get

00:05:27.539 --> 00:05:29.269 
the park so the younger plants will get
their<00:05:28.110> own<00:05:28.139> nutrition<00:05:28.680> the<00:05:28.770> older<00:05:28.949> ones<00:05:29.129> will

00:05:29.269 --> 00:05:29.279 
their own nutrition the older ones will

00:05:29.279 --> 00:05:31.010 
their own nutrition the older ones will
get<00:05:29.370> the<00:05:29.520> nutrition<00:05:30.029> and<00:05:30.479> that<00:05:30.659> way<00:05:30.750> we<00:05:30.900> can

00:05:31.010 --> 00:05:31.020 
get the nutrition and that way we can

00:05:31.020 --> 00:05:33.050 
get the nutrition and that way we can
kind<00:05:31.139> of<00:05:31.229> customize<00:05:31.460> the<00:05:32.460> growing<00:05:32.759> areas

00:05:33.050 --> 00:05:33.060 
kind of customize the growing areas

00:05:33.060 --> 00:05:35.679 
kind of customize the growing areas
inside<00:05:33.389> and<00:05:33.719> also<00:05:34.319> that<00:05:34.560> reduces<00:05:34.979> risk<00:05:35.189> from

00:05:35.679 --> 00:05:35.689 
inside and also that reduces risk from

00:05:35.689 --> 00:05:38.360 
inside and also that reduces risk from
from<00:05:36.689> from<00:05:36.960> diseases<00:05:37.289> that<00:05:37.409> may<00:05:38.159> spread

00:05:38.360 --> 00:05:38.370 
from from diseases that may spread

00:05:38.370 --> 00:05:40.029 
from from diseases that may spread
through<00:05:38.580> water

00:05:40.029 --> 00:05:40.039 
through water

00:05:40.039 --> 00:05:42.860 
through water
we're<00:05:41.039> not<00:05:41.189> organic<00:05:41.490> but<00:05:41.879> we're<00:05:42.389> basically<00:05:42.539> as

00:05:42.860 --> 00:05:42.870 
we're not organic but we're basically as

00:05:42.870 --> 00:05:44.540 
we're not organic but we're basically as
clean<00:05:43.080> as<00:05:43.229> you<00:05:43.259> get<00:05:43.560> because<00:05:43.740> lettuce<00:05:44.129> is<00:05:44.279> it's

00:05:44.540 --> 00:05:44.550 
clean as you get because lettuce is it's

00:05:44.550 --> 00:05:45.890 
clean as you get because lettuce is it's
almost<00:05:44.819> impossible<00:05:45.089> to<00:05:45.360> grow<00:05:45.569> completely

have been completely broken down before

00:06:03.150 --> 00:06:05.659 
have been completely broken down before
we<00:06:03.180> harvest<00:06:03.539> or<00:06:03.629> sell<00:06:03.839> that<00:06:04.190> so<00:06:05.190> at<00:06:05.400> the<00:06:05.520> end<00:06:05.580> of

00:06:05.659 --> 00:06:05.669 
we harvest or sell that so at the end of

00:06:05.669 --> 00:06:08.360 
we harvest or sell that so at the end of
the<00:06:05.759> day<00:06:05.909> it's<00:06:06.409> it's<00:06:07.409> much<00:06:07.710> cleaner<00:06:07.979> than<00:06:08.189> any

00:06:08.360 --> 00:06:08.370 
the day it's it's much cleaner than any

00:06:08.370 --> 00:06:09.559 
the day it's it's much cleaner than any
organic<00:06:08.669> parties<00:06:09.060> that<00:06:09.210> you<00:06:09.300> would<00:06:09.419> get

00:06:09.559 --> 00:06:09.569 
organic parties that you would get

00:06:09.569 --> 00:06:11.240 
organic parties that you would get
because<00:06:09.839> in<00:06:09.990> organic<00:06:10.439> they<00:06:10.860> do<00:06:10.919> spray

00:06:11.240 --> 00:06:11.250 
because in organic they do spray

00:06:11.250 --> 00:06:11.869 
because in organic they do spray
pesticides

00:06:11.869 --> 00:06:11.879 
pesticides

00:06:11.879 --> 00:06:13.429 
pesticides
it's<00:06:12.599> just<00:06:12.839> that<00:06:12.960> they<00:06:13.080> need<00:06:13.199> to<00:06:13.289> leave<00:06:13.409> a

00:06:13.429 --> 00:06:13.439 
it's just that they need to leave a

00:06:13.439 --> 00:06:16.629 
it's just that they need to leave a
window<00:06:13.620> of<00:06:13.830> time<00:06:13.979> before<00:06:14.039> they<00:06:14.490> sell<00:06:14.789> it<00:06:14.909> to

00:06:16.629 --> 00:06:16.639 
window of time before they sell it to

00:06:16.639 --> 00:06:23.019 
window of time before they sell it to
beautiful

00:06:23.019 --> 00:06:23.029 

00:06:23.029 --> 00:06:25.209 

it's<00:06:23.839> been<00:06:23.989> very<00:06:24.139> difficult<00:06:24.649> because<00:06:24.799> there

00:06:25.209 --> 00:06:25.219 
it's been very difficult because there

00:06:25.219 --> 00:06:26.799 
it's been very difficult because there
is<00:06:25.339> no<00:06:25.579> know-how<00:06:25.939> nobody<00:06:26.329> knows<00:06:26.449> how<00:06:26.599> to<00:06:26.689> do

00:06:26.799 --> 00:06:26.809 
is no know-how nobody knows how to do

00:06:26.809 --> 00:06:28.659 
is no know-how nobody knows how to do
this<00:06:26.959> in<00:06:27.289> this<00:06:27.799> type<00:06:27.949> of<00:06:27.979> climate<00:06:28.219> with<00:06:28.579> this

00:06:28.659 --> 00:06:28.669 
this in this type of climate with this

00:06:28.669 --> 00:06:30.459 
this in this type of climate with this
type<00:06:28.879> of<00:06:28.909> crop<00:06:29.329> and<00:06:29.629> so<00:06:30.259> we're<00:06:30.379> doing

00:06:30.459 --> 00:06:30.469 
type of crop and so we're doing

00:06:30.469 --> 00:06:31.719 
type of crop and so we're doing
everything<00:06:30.649> from<00:06:31.039> scratch

00:06:31.719 --> 00:06:31.729 
everything from scratch

00:06:31.729 --> 00:06:35.199 
everything from scratch
there<00:06:32.029> is<00:06:32.119> no<00:06:32.299> knowledgebase<00:06:34.089> regarding<00:06:35.089> what

there is no knowledgebase regarding what

there is no knowledgebase regarding what
we<00:06:35.299> do<00:06:35.449> and<00:06:35.689> so<00:06:35.749> we<00:06:36.379> need<00:06:36.559> to<00:06:36.589> learn<00:06:36.709> everything

00:06:36.969 --> 00:06:36.979 
we do and so we need to learn everything

00:06:36.979 --> 00:06:38.859 
we do and so we need to learn everything
we<00:06:37.129> do<00:06:37.399> everything<00:06:37.699> trial<00:06:38.089> by<00:06:38.209> trial<00:06:38.809> and

00:06:38.859 --> 00:06:38.869 
we do everything trial by trial and

00:06:38.869 --> 00:06:41.049 
we do everything trial by trial and
error<00:06:39.049> and<00:06:39.259> we<00:06:40.039> normally<00:06:40.489> make<00:06:40.669> a<00:06:40.699> mistake

00:06:41.049 --> 00:06:41.059 
error and we normally make a mistake

00:06:41.059 --> 00:06:42.519 
error and we normally make a mistake
first<00:06:41.299> and<00:06:41.569> we<00:06:41.689> lose<00:06:41.869> a<00:06:41.929> lot<00:06:42.079> of<00:06:42.110> money<00:06:42.289> making

00:06:42.519 --> 00:06:42.529 
first and we lose a lot of money making

00:06:42.529 --> 00:06:43.089 
first and we lose a lot of money making
that<00:06:42.769> mistake

00:06:43.089 --> 00:06:43.099 
that mistake

00:06:43.099 --> 00:06:45.699 
that mistake
there's<00:06:43.699> a<00:06:43.729> lot<00:06:43.849> more<00:06:43.879> learning<00:06:44.209> out<00:06:44.569> to<00:06:44.809> avoid

00:06:45.699 --> 00:06:45.709 
there's a lot more learning out to avoid

00:06:45.709 --> 00:06:47.169 
there's a lot more learning out to avoid
them<00:06:45.919> and<00:06:46.069> take<00:06:46.279> the<00:06:46.399> next<00:06:46.579> time<00:06:46.729> and<00:06:46.909> solve<00:06:47.089> it

00:06:47.169 --> 00:06:47.179 
them and take the next time and solve it

00:06:47.179 --> 00:06:48.819 
them and take the next time and solve it
as<00:06:47.329> well<00:06:47.509> so<00:06:47.539> you<00:06:48.079> could<00:06:48.229> go<00:06:48.379> through<00:06:48.559> several

00:06:48.819 --> 00:06:48.829 
as well so you could go through several

00:06:48.829 --> 00:06:50.709 
as well so you could go through several
cycles<00:06:49.099> or<00:06:49.429> years<00:06:49.669> just<00:06:49.909> to<00:06:50.059> understand<00:06:50.509> how

00:06:50.709 --> 00:06:50.719 
cycles or years just to understand how

00:06:50.719 --> 00:06:53.919 
cycles or years just to understand how
to<00:06:50.989> fix<00:06:51.259> one<00:06:51.469> problem
