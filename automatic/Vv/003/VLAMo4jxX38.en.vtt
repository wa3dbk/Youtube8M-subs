 It is so beautiful green and leave such a 

00:01:56.890 --> 00:02:01.759
 dead body is made quite cool so 

00:01:59.780 --> 00:02:03.140
 I have to read a lot so I have to read 

00:02:01.759 --> 00:02:06.320
 actually do not want the ball 

00:02:03.140 --> 00:02:09.170

00:02:09.170 --> 00:02:13.130
 So it really is not done now 

00:02:10.850 --> 00:02:15.140
 so fairy-tale is one sitting thinks as 

00:02:13.130 --> 00:02:16.910
 that's why everything and her dad are totally crazy 

00:02:15.140 --> 00:02:19.400
 crazy and you always like that 

00:02:16.910 --> 00:02:20.540
 zombies and such and she believes it 

00:02:19.400 --> 00:02:24.080
 Do not stop until you stop like that 

00:02:20.540 --> 00:02:26.780
 suddenly a device and of course 

00:02:24.080 --> 00:02:29.030
 I go back to a guy in the game and then 

00:02:26.780 --> 00:02:30.830
 then it turns out with the zombies and such 

00:02:29.030 --> 00:02:33.290
 knows only she is then again the 

00:02:30.830 --> 00:02:34.489
 ignorant and now we really need 

00:02:33.290 --> 00:02:36.530
 really great 

00:02:34.489 --> 00:02:38.570
 that is now very fast is there 

00:02:36.530 --> 00:02:40.489

00:02:49.010 --> 00:02:52.459
 Part behavior 

00:02:50.900 --> 00:02:54.739
 I'm down in the 

00:02:52.459 --> 00:02:56.690
 infobox the next book I found on the 

00:02:54.739 --> 00:02:58.880
 sofa and take on me so I want 

00:02:56.690 --> 00:03:01.989
 necessarily read but not yet read 

00:02:58.880 --> 00:03:01.989
 have that too 

00:03:02.530 --> 00:03:08.239
 this is the city of carrick o'brien 

00:03:05.900 --> 00:03:09.950
 the missing children but I can 

00:03:08.239 --> 00:03:11.299
 I can not be that general now either 

00:03:09.950 --> 00:03:13.579
 have it only one or two 

00:03:11.299 --> 00:03:17.269
 weeks read something so good 

00:03:13.579 --> 00:03:19.640
 So I was fine so I got it 

00:03:17.269 --> 00:03:21.470
 not given four out of five points 

00:03:19.640 --> 00:03:23.239
 I really liked it and 

00:03:21.470 --> 00:03:28.130
 but it is definitely still place 

00:03:23.239 --> 00:03:30.790
 up and me as the jobs for so long 

00:03:28.130 --> 00:03:30.790
 back and 

00:03:31.010 --> 00:03:35.959
 been sad and yes it does once 

00:03:34.189 --> 00:03:40.610
 my next books are not read 

00:03:35.959 --> 00:03:42.890
 I'll definitely go that way 

00:03:40.610 --> 00:03:49.940
 continue with jennifer sp frost kiss the 

00:03:42.890 --> 00:03:52.400
 myth academician bought up i love 

00:03:49.940 --> 00:03:53.480
 then books totally so the rent 

00:03:52.400 --> 00:03:55.430
 academy 

00:03:53.480 --> 00:03:58.280
 that's totally my thing it is 

00:03:55.430 --> 00:04:02.060
 a school for such mythical beings 

00:03:58.280 --> 00:04:03.829
 now so spartan and so viking 

00:04:02.060 --> 00:04:04.250
 and stuff on the school so all 

00:04:03.829 --> 00:04:05.989
 myths 

00:04:04.250 --> 00:04:09.019
 So there are those who really exist 

00:04:05.989 --> 00:04:12.290
 these children I'd say go so on 

00:04:09.019 --> 00:04:14.590
 his school and if she does not know 

00:04:12.290 --> 00:04:17.810
 that they are so particularly it is and 

00:04:14.590 --> 00:04:21.400
 is then experienced after the death of her 

00:04:17.810 --> 00:04:24.830
 mother then by a car accident 

00:04:21.400 --> 00:04:26.479
 died died is that she is such a 

00:04:24.830 --> 00:04:29.419
 fork has so it can always be like that 

00:04:26.479 --> 00:04:31.580
 find objects as one now 

00:04:29.419 --> 00:04:33.380
 Gips no matter who and then it's just 

00:04:31.580 --> 00:04:35.690
 So what's special about these schools? 

00:04:33.380 --> 00:04:37.370
 because the gift has actually nobody has 

00:04:35.690 --> 00:04:41.660
 but she actually does not think so 

00:04:37.370 --> 00:04:47.330
 such a special gift and there I am 

00:04:41.660 --> 00:04:49.760
 they do it differently but it does exist 

00:04:47.330 --> 00:04:51.740
 now five parts and I believe it there 

00:04:49.760 --> 00:04:53.210
 give one more 16 

00:04:51.740 --> 00:04:55.550
 yes, that's why 

00:04:53.210 --> 00:04:58.010
 I'm not good sleep yet 

00:04:55.550 --> 00:05:00.500
 worry if the book but I have so much 

00:04:58.010 --> 00:05:02.360
 Buchheim and I know all about it 

00:05:00.500 --> 00:05:03.280
 start a new one which is easy 

00:05:02.360 --> 00:05:09.320
 read through 

00:05:03.280 --> 00:05:10.820
 that's really great so I want to 

00:05:09.320 --> 00:05:13.909
 First , make a few rooms ready 

00:05:10.820 --> 00:05:15.979
 but I also really want to be next to that 

00:05:13.909 --> 00:05:18.880
 compliance is also quite nice 

00:05:15.979 --> 00:05:21.770
 confused behind even very simple 

00:05:18.880 --> 00:05:23.599
 but only a book and it is 

00:05:21.770 --> 00:05:26.750
 also from the same pot on 

00:05:23.599 --> 00:05:29.300
 my sofa and that is about here 

00:05:26.750 --> 00:05:30.949
 Angel's night of Kate I have that 

00:05:29.300 --> 00:05:35.080
 will buy too much of you yes 

00:05:30.949 --> 00:05:37.599
 raved about it and me 

00:05:35.080 --> 00:05:39.370
 solve so I already have the three-volume 

00:05:37.599 --> 00:05:40.990
 let there be another fourth wall 

00:05:39.370 --> 00:05:42.550
 but I do not have them anymore 

00:05:40.990 --> 00:05:44.710
 solved when he first found me 

00:05:42.550 --> 00:05:46.180
 really good and he's really good for me 

00:05:44.710 --> 00:05:47.409
 I like another wave have 

00:05:46.180 --> 00:05:48.310
 I keep going like that a bit 

00:05:47.409 --> 00:05:53.349
 disappointed 

00:05:48.310 --> 00:05:56.849
 so yes but ensures've read 

00:05:53.349 --> 00:05:56.849
 So I think so especially if 

00:06:01.530 --> 00:06:07.990
 I'm really good at only the others 

00:06:04.870 --> 00:06:10.990
 then do not share so well where 

00:06:07.990 --> 00:06:13.449
 I wonder how I find that 

00:06:10.990 --> 00:06:17.080
 were the five dynasty books says 

00:06:13.449 --> 00:06:21.340
 sarah hughes have read and all 

00:06:17.080 --> 00:06:23.169
 almost another book links to another 

00:06:21.340 --> 00:06:26.169
 book already at the front desk she gives 

00:06:23.169 --> 00:06:30.599
 also and linked and so I say 

00:06:26.169 --> 00:06:30.599
 for me once closely
