00:00:00.199 --> 00:00:07.980
 June 30, 2010 an epochal date for the release 

00:00:04.560 --> 00:00:09.570
 of eclipse or eclipse black lips and certain 

00:00:07.980 --> 00:00:12.090
 I have not yet figured out how to say the 

00:00:09.570 --> 00:00:14.370
 third film of the twilight saga 

00:00:12.090 --> 00:00:15.269
 I was there I went to the cinema a 

00:00:14.370 --> 00:00:16.859
 see this movie 

00:00:15.269 --> 00:00:19.650
 at the beginning I felt myself with one 

00:00:16.859 --> 00:00:24.449
 a fourteen year old is mentioned by the various 

00:00:19.650 --> 00:00:26.519
 edward but then I understood the true meaning 

00:00:24.449 --> 00:00:29.160
 one thing is immediately noticed in this film 

00:00:26.519 --> 00:00:31.560
 there is something wrong with this film 

00:00:29.160 --> 00:00:36.440
 something damn wrong right 

00:00:31.560 --> 00:00:36.440
 from the first scene we understand this thing 

00:00:39.460 --> 00:00:45.370
 is found I love you the protagonists 

00:00:43.640 --> 00:00:47.720
 The male characters in this film are called 

00:00:45.370 --> 00:00:50.660
 Eduardo and Jacob 

00:00:47.720 --> 00:00:53.510
 but what the fuck names are Edward and 

00:00:50.660 --> 00:00:56.210
 giacobbe edoardo isabella are on this 

00:00:53.510 --> 00:00:59.480
 he looks at her intently and 

00:00:56.210 --> 00:01:02.739
 he whispers marry me but he has a nice head 

00:00:59.480 --> 00:01:02.739
 only one thing 

00:01:05.440 --> 00:01:11.210
 here is the real eclipse plot this one 

00:01:08.570 --> 00:01:13.460
 Christian are two years two years that 

00:01:11.210 --> 00:01:15.050
 he wants to give it up because he wants to 

00:01:13.460 --> 00:01:17.780
 give it to him puts it on the plate 

00:01:15.050 --> 00:01:18.800
 silver to this patented idiot he 

00:01:17.780 --> 00:01:22.280
 he wants to marry her 

00:01:18.800 --> 00:01:23.840
 he wants to marry her first I don't know 

00:01:22.280 --> 00:01:25.880
 how vampires work though i think 

00:01:23.840 --> 00:01:27.500
 at this point in Edward's underpants 

00:01:25.880 --> 00:01:29.630
 a territory has grown but the 

00:01:27.500 --> 00:01:31.420
 danger is always around the corner and movies 

00:01:29.630 --> 00:01:34.100
 go ahead with these characters 

00:01:31.420 --> 00:01:36.729
 fantastic for example there is the marathon runner 

00:01:34.100 --> 00:01:36.729
 victory 

00:01:46.640 --> 00:01:50.659
 meanwhile he was searching in every way 

00:01:48.560 --> 00:01:52.880
 to let isabella understand that she loves her 

00:01:50.659 --> 00:01:55.580
 also quite explicitly you know that 

00:01:52.880 --> 00:01:57.800
 nice when an imprinting with one 

00:01:55.580 --> 00:01:59.869
 person is as if everything else does not 

00:01:57.800 --> 00:02:02.790
 counted as if that person was 

00:01:59.869 --> 00:02:05.310
 the only reason barber 

00:02:02.790 --> 00:02:09.750
 you know it's like everything else doesn't 

00:02:05.310 --> 00:02:13.610
 instead, this person counts 

00:02:09.750 --> 00:02:13.610
 the only reason to live 

00:02:13.950 --> 00:02:20.129
 nice person the person that matters is 

00:02:17.879 --> 00:02:22.980
 important with a person who is 

00:02:20.129 --> 00:02:25.410
 imprinting all accounts to imprinting 

00:02:22.980 --> 00:02:26.040
 beautiful but nothing much of what 

00:02:25.410 --> 00:02:27.660
 comes after 

00:02:26.040 --> 00:02:29.640
 in the film plot you can skip the 

00:02:27.660 --> 00:02:31.380
 how much he kisses kisses beautiful pretty uncle 

00:02:29.640 --> 00:02:33.000
 still hand edardo the cone badger yes 

00:02:31.380 --> 00:02:35.010
 change a shirt instead plays less 

00:02:33.000 --> 00:02:36.720
 he finds his victories so much wins the 

00:02:35.010 --> 00:02:38.700
 new york marathon a crowd of 

00:02:36.720 --> 00:02:41.190
 Brainless vampires no one knows why 

00:02:38.700 --> 00:02:43.410
 the march of the forces probably begins 

00:02:41.190 --> 00:02:45.900
 wrong city and therefore fan pirri e 

00:02:43.410 --> 00:02:49.260
 the wet thousands of years of blood struggles 

00:02:45.900 --> 00:02:50.790
 summer bots and mozzichi make shame 

00:02:49.260 --> 00:02:52.769

 animal form because they did not trust 

00:02:56.670 --> 00:03:01.069
 just was a master against vampires 

00:02:58.680 --> 00:03:01.069
 Baby 

00:03:02.060 --> 00:03:07.030

00:03:03.230 --> 00:03:09.650
 marmots at the brush and caresses chapter 

00:03:07.030 --> 00:03:13.459
 against newborn vampires 

00:03:09.650 --> 00:03:15.880
 you have to use the brush but also the 

00:03:13.459 --> 00:03:15.880
 caresses 

00:03:27.780 --> 00:03:32.520

00:03:38.819 --> 00:03:43.860

00:03:41.190 --> 00:03:49.010
 from the mouths of Isabella Edward on 

00:03:43.860 --> 00:03:53.340

 cig or on the contrary why I could 

00:04:32.070 --> 00:04:37.830
 killing you nice, you know, maybe you're talking about the fact 

00:04:35.310 --> 00:04:40.470
 that you could transform me by biting me 

00:04:37.830 --> 00:04:41.970
 beautiful too big 

00:04:40.470 --> 00:04:45.150
 I'm talking about the fact that I could split a 

00:04:41.970 --> 00:04:47.880
 half like an apple with my talk about 

00:04:45.150 --> 00:04:50.340
 the fact that now it is huge no longer has one 

00:04:47.880 --> 00:04:52.740
 size is too large I can no longer manage to 

00:04:50.340 --> 00:04:56.010

00:04:52.740 --> 00:04:58.950

00:05:17.100 --> 00:05:20.190
 at that point I felt bad for them 

00:05:18.750 --> 00:05:22.380
 then there is the scene in the tent where 

00:05:20.190 --> 00:05:25.169
 heaven burned forced to assist while 

00:05:22.380 --> 00:05:27.270
 Jacob prepares him for Isabella 

00:05:25.169 --> 00:05:29.069
 after all this victoria breaks like that 

00:05:27.270 --> 00:05:30.720
 the glass wall that is in my kitchen 

00:05:29.069 --> 00:05:33.270
 grandmother and at the end vampires and wolves 

00:05:30.720 --> 00:05:35.300
 continue to hate each other for all 

00:05:33.270 --> 00:05:37.860
