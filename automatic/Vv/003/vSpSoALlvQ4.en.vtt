Wolf class submarine obviously a little
bit<00:00:38.170> of<00:00:38.350> progress<00:00:38.530> since<00:00:38.980> the<00:00:39.100> last<00:00:39.130> time<00:00:39.489> you

00:00:39.660 --> 00:00:39.670 
bit of progress since the last time you

00:00:39.670 --> 00:00:42.240 
bit of progress since the last time you
saw<00:00:39.820> you<00:00:39.880> I've<00:00:40.120> got<00:00:40.300> the<00:00:40.510> the<00:00:41.050> paint<00:00:41.320> job<00:00:41.559> is

00:00:42.240 --> 00:00:42.250 
saw you I've got the the paint job is

00:00:42.250 --> 00:00:45.479 
saw you I've got the the paint job is
all<00:00:42.489> finished<00:00:42.760> up<00:00:43.140> it's<00:00:44.140> basically<00:00:44.350> a<00:00:44.710> because

00:00:45.479 --> 00:00:45.489 
all finished up it's basically a because

00:00:45.489 --> 00:00:48.860 
all finished up it's basically a because
in<00:00:45.700> chromium<00:00:46.090> primer<00:00:46.570> color<00:00:47.170> on<00:00:47.980> the<00:00:48.220> bottom

00:00:48.860 --> 00:00:48.870 
in chromium primer color on the bottom

00:00:52.380 --> 00:00:52.390 
flat black on the top weathered gray on

00:00:52.390 --> 00:00:56.790 
flat black on the top weathered gray on
the<00:00:53.140> bow<00:00:53.320> for<00:00:53.379> the<00:00:53.740> sonar<00:00:54.250> dome<00:00:54.460> and<00:00:55.650> then<00:00:56.650> I

00:00:56.790 --> 00:00:56.800 
the bow for the sonar dome and then I

00:00:56.800 --> 00:00:58.170 
the bow for the sonar dome and then I
did<00:00:57.010> some<00:00:57.730> weathering

00:00:58.170 --> 00:00:58.180 
did some weathering

00:00:58.180 --> 00:01:03.240 
did some weathering
I've<00:00:58.480> got<00:00:59.460> grime<00:01:00.460> that<00:01:00.940> I<00:01:00.970> sprayed<00:01:02.130> around<00:01:03.130> the

00:01:03.240 --> 00:01:03.250 
I've got grime that I sprayed around the

00:01:03.250 --> 00:01:06.210 
I've got grime that I sprayed around the
waterline<00:01:03.730> and<00:01:04.059> that<00:01:04.300> was<00:01:04.449> followed<00:01:04.720> by<00:01:05.220> some

00:01:06.210 --> 00:01:06.220 
waterline and that was followed by some

00:01:06.220 --> 00:01:08.880 
waterline and that was followed by some
green<00:01:06.700> to<00:01:07.180> mimic<00:01:07.750> the<00:01:07.900> algae<00:01:08.290> growth<00:01:08.619> that

00:01:08.880 --> 00:01:08.890 
green to mimic the algae growth that

00:01:08.890 --> 00:01:11.190 
green to mimic the algae growth that
appears<00:01:09.850> at<00:01:10.000> the<00:01:10.090> waterline<00:01:10.390> on<00:01:10.750> all<00:01:10.930> of<00:01:11.080> these

00:01:11.190 --> 00:01:11.200 
appears at the waterline on all of these

00:01:11.200 --> 00:01:14.219 
appears at the waterline on all of these
boats<00:01:11.880> you<00:01:12.880> can<00:01:13.030> see<00:01:13.210> some<00:01:13.450> streaking<00:01:14.050> that<00:01:14.170> I

00:01:14.219 --> 00:01:14.229 
boats you can see some streaking that I

00:01:14.229 --> 00:01:16.800 
boats you can see some streaking that I
got<00:01:14.440> on<00:01:14.710> the<00:01:15.430> upper<00:01:16.060> hull<00:01:16.240> and<00:01:16.479> that<00:01:16.630> was

00:01:16.800 --> 00:01:16.810 
got on the upper hull and that was

00:01:16.810 --> 00:01:21.170 
got on the upper hull and that was
accomplished<00:01:17.850> with<00:01:18.850> some<00:01:19.690> pastels<00:01:20.140> and

00:01:21.170 --> 00:01:21.180 
accomplished with some pastels and

00:01:21.180 --> 00:01:24.810 
accomplished with some pastels and
basically<00:01:22.180> they<00:01:22.420> were<00:01:22.530> brushed<00:01:23.530> on<00:01:23.770> and<00:01:24.670> then

00:01:24.810 --> 00:01:24.820 
basically they were brushed on and then

00:01:24.820 --> 00:01:27.210 
basically they were brushed on and then
streaked<00:01:25.240> down<00:01:25.540> with<00:01:25.869> paper<00:01:26.530> towel<00:01:26.830> and<00:01:27.130> I

00:01:27.210 --> 00:01:27.220 
streaked down with paper towel and I

00:01:27.220 --> 00:01:29.010 
streaked down with paper towel and I
apologize<00:01:28.030> is<00:01:28.179> a<00:01:28.240> little<00:01:28.450> dirty<00:01:28.660> because<00:01:28.899> I've

00:01:29.010 --> 00:01:29.020 
apologize is a little dirty because I've

00:01:29.020 --> 00:01:31.919 
apologize is a little dirty because I've
had<00:01:29.289> it<00:01:29.319> in<00:01:29.560> the<00:01:29.710> pool<00:01:29.920> for<00:01:30.910> trimming<00:01:31.210> purposes

00:01:31.919 --> 00:01:31.929 
had it in the pool for trimming purposes

00:01:31.929 --> 00:01:35.040 
had it in the pool for trimming purposes
but<00:01:32.670> this<00:01:33.670> is<00:01:33.880> what<00:01:34.090> the<00:01:34.240> paint<00:01:34.509> job<00:01:34.810> looks

00:01:35.040 --> 00:01:35.050 
but this is what the paint job looks

00:01:35.050 --> 00:01:42.120 
but this is what the paint job looks
like<00:01:36.149> overall<00:01:38.160> the<00:01:39.160> masts<00:01:39.700> are<00:01:40.229> in<00:01:41.229> place<00:01:41.709> and

00:01:42.120 --> 00:01:42.130 
like overall the masts are in place and

00:01:42.130 --> 00:01:43.469 
like overall the masts are in place and
whether<00:01:42.310> you<00:01:42.580> can<00:01:42.700> see<00:01:42.880> I've<00:01:42.970> got<00:01:43.090> I've<00:01:43.300> got

00:01:43.469 --> 00:01:43.479 
whether you can see I've got I've got

00:01:43.479 --> 00:01:46.699 
whether you can see I've got I've got
three<00:01:43.840> of<00:01:43.869> them<00:01:44.140> that<00:01:44.920> I've<00:01:45.250> chosen<00:01:45.640> to<00:01:45.940> model

00:01:46.699 --> 00:01:46.709 
three of them that I've chosen to model

00:01:46.709 --> 00:01:50.249 
three of them that I've chosen to model
these<00:01:47.709> two<00:01:47.890> are<00:01:48.130> fixed<00:01:48.970> and<00:01:49.929> this<00:01:50.080> one

00:01:50.249 --> 00:01:50.259 
these two are fixed and this one

00:01:50.259 --> 00:01:52.230 
these two are fixed and this one
actually<00:01:50.649> if<00:01:50.770> you<00:01:50.860> look<00:01:50.890> it's<00:01:51.190> got<00:01:51.310> a<00:01:51.369> hole<00:01:51.789> and

00:01:52.230 --> 00:01:52.240 
actually if you look it's got a hole and

00:01:52.240 --> 00:01:54.870 
actually if you look it's got a hole and
the<00:01:52.330> reason<00:01:52.750> for<00:01:52.780> that<00:01:52.959> is<00:01:53.440> for<00:01:53.500> the<00:01:54.310> snort

00:01:54.870 --> 00:01:54.880 
the reason for that is for the snort

00:01:54.880 --> 00:01:58.100 
the reason for that is for the snort
assembly<00:01:55.630> for<00:01:56.530> the<00:01:56.649> watertight<00:01:57.039> cylinder<00:01:57.580> and

00:01:58.100 --> 00:01:58.110 
assembly for the watertight cylinder and

00:01:58.110 --> 00:02:00.300 
assembly for the watertight cylinder and
basically<00:01:59.110> the<00:01:59.289> way<00:01:59.380> that<00:01:59.560> works<00:01:59.800> is<00:01:59.979> I've<00:02:00.160> got

00:02:00.300 --> 00:02:00.310 
basically the way that works is I've got

00:02:00.310 --> 00:02:04.109 
basically the way that works is I've got
a<00:02:00.340> large<00:02:00.750> brass<00:02:01.750> tube<00:02:02.410> that<00:02:02.950> you<00:02:03.580> insert<00:02:04.000> in

00:02:04.109 --> 00:02:04.119 
a large brass tube that you insert in

00:02:04.119 --> 00:02:05.969 
a large brass tube that you insert in
the<00:02:04.209> upper<00:02:04.420> hull<00:02:04.569> pops<00:02:05.110> out<00:02:05.319> the<00:02:05.349> top<00:02:05.470> but<00:02:05.860> it

00:02:05.969 --> 00:02:05.979 
the upper hull pops out the top but it

00:02:05.979 --> 00:02:08.520 
the upper hull pops out the top but it
is<00:02:06.009> actually<00:02:06.550> part<00:02:06.959> integrated<00:02:07.959> as<00:02:08.050> part<00:02:08.140> of

00:02:08.520 --> 00:02:08.530 
is actually part integrated as part of

00:02:08.530 --> 00:02:13.400 
is actually part integrated as part of
the<00:02:08.979> watertight<00:02:09.670> cylinder<00:02:11.640> so<00:02:12.640> that's<00:02:12.880> the

00:02:13.400 --> 00:02:13.410 
the watertight cylinder so that's the

00:02:13.410 --> 00:02:16.260 
the watertight cylinder so that's the
the<00:02:14.410> hull<00:02:14.650> now<00:02:14.920> as<00:02:15.099> I<00:02:15.220> mentioned<00:02:15.670> I<00:02:15.760> did<00:02:15.970> get

00:02:16.260 --> 00:02:16.270 
the hull now as I mentioned I did get

00:02:16.270 --> 00:02:19.500 
the hull now as I mentioned I did get
this<00:02:16.480> in<00:02:16.750> the<00:02:17.020> water<00:02:17.790> yesterday<00:02:18.790> and<00:02:19.270> actually

00:02:19.500 --> 00:02:19.510 
this in the water yesterday and actually

00:02:19.510 --> 00:02:24.030 
this in the water yesterday and actually
things<00:02:20.050> went<00:02:21.209> far<00:02:22.209> better<00:02:22.540> than<00:02:23.050> I<00:02:23.620> could<00:02:24.010> have

00:02:24.030 --> 00:02:24.040 
things went far better than I could have

00:02:24.040 --> 00:02:28.199 
things went far better than I could have
hoped<00:02:24.160> for<00:02:25.380> upon<00:02:26.380> the<00:02:26.860> initial<00:02:27.280> dunk<00:02:27.580> it<00:02:27.880> got

00:02:28.199 --> 00:02:28.209 
hoped for upon the initial dunk it got

00:02:28.209 --> 00:02:31.740 
hoped for upon the initial dunk it got
to<00:02:28.569> I'd<00:02:29.080> say<00:02:29.349> 90%<00:02:30.220> of<00:02:30.760> the<00:02:30.970> way<00:02:31.120> there<00:02:31.450> and<00:02:31.480> that

00:02:31.740 --> 00:02:31.750 
to I'd say 90% of the way there and that

00:02:31.750 --> 00:02:33.900 
to I'd say 90% of the way there and that
was<00:02:31.930> only<00:02:32.349> with<00:02:32.860> the<00:02:33.010> addition

00:02:33.900 --> 00:02:33.910 
was only with the addition

00:02:33.910 --> 00:02:37.590 
was only with the addition
of<00:02:34.080> some<00:02:35.080> lead<00:02:35.290> bar<00:02:35.500> in<00:02:36.340> the<00:02:36.640> keel<00:02:36.940> as<00:02:37.180> you<00:02:37.420> guys

00:02:37.590 --> 00:02:37.600 
of some lead bar in the keel as you guys

00:02:37.600 --> 00:02:41.100 
of some lead bar in the keel as you guys
had<00:02:37.870> seen<00:02:38.140> earlier<00:02:38.410> so<00:02:39.810> the<00:02:40.810> cylinder

00:02:41.100 --> 00:02:41.110 
had seen earlier so the cylinder

00:02:41.110 --> 00:02:42.750 
had seen earlier so the cylinder
basically<00:02:41.620> provided<00:02:42.040> all<00:02:42.130> the<00:02:42.160> buoyancy

00:02:42.750 --> 00:02:42.760 
basically provided all the buoyancy

00:02:42.760 --> 00:02:44.610 
basically provided all the buoyancy
without<00:02:43.030> the<00:02:43.330> need<00:02:43.600> for<00:02:43.630> additional<00:02:44.020> foam

00:02:44.610 --> 00:02:44.620 
without the need for additional foam

00:02:44.620 --> 00:02:48.810 
without the need for additional foam
which<00:02:44.980> is<00:02:45.130> always<00:02:45.340> a<00:02:45.880> plus<00:02:46.890> I<00:02:47.890> tweaked<00:02:48.670> it

00:02:48.810 --> 00:02:48.820 
which is always a plus I tweaked it

00:02:48.820 --> 00:02:50.310 
which is always a plus I tweaked it
around<00:02:49.090> a<00:02:49.270> little<00:02:49.480> bit<00:02:49.660> but<00:02:49.870> actually<00:02:50.020> what

00:02:50.310 --> 00:02:50.320 
around a little bit but actually what

00:02:50.320 --> 00:02:53.280 
around a little bit but actually what
ended<00:02:50.530> up<00:02:50.650> happening<00:02:50.910> is<00:02:52.020> discovered<00:02:53.020> that

00:02:53.280 --> 00:02:53.290 
ended up happening is discovered that

00:02:53.290 --> 00:02:56.600 
ended up happening is discovered that
the<00:02:54.180> ballast<00:02:55.180> tank<00:02:55.390> was<00:02:55.570> allowing<00:02:55.960> a<00:02:56.020> lot<00:02:56.260> of

00:02:56.600 --> 00:02:56.610 
the ballast tank was allowing a lot of

00:02:56.610 --> 00:02:58.050 
the ballast tank was allowing a lot of
slush

00:02:58.050 --> 00:02:58.060 
slush

00:02:58.060 --> 00:03:00.150 
slush
so<00:02:58.180> it<00:02:58.330> was<00:02:58.510> very<00:02:58.570> very<00:02:59.050> difficult<00:02:59.560> to<00:02:59.980> get

00:03:00.150 --> 00:03:00.160 
so it was very very difficult to get

00:03:00.160 --> 00:03:03.720 
so it was very very difficult to get
trimmed<00:03:00.550> in<00:03:01.770> submerged<00:03:02.770> trim<00:03:03.280> because<00:03:03.490> the

00:03:03.720 --> 00:03:03.730 
trimmed in submerged trim because the

00:03:03.730 --> 00:03:05.850 
trimmed in submerged trim because the
water<00:03:03.940> kept<00:03:04.180> sloshing<00:03:04.810> from<00:03:04.960> one<00:03:05.230> end<00:03:05.500> of<00:03:05.740> the

00:03:05.850 --> 00:03:05.860 
water kept sloshing from one end of the

00:03:05.860 --> 00:03:07.320 
water kept sloshing from one end of the
ballast<00:03:06.160> tank<00:03:06.400> to<00:03:06.520> the<00:03:06.580> other<00:03:06.790> so<00:03:07.030> I<00:03:07.060> came<00:03:07.150> up

00:03:07.320 --> 00:03:07.330 
ballast tank to the other so I came up

00:03:07.330 --> 00:03:10.650 
ballast tank to the other so I came up
with<00:03:07.480> a<00:03:07.930> solution<00:03:08.440> and<00:03:09.000> this<00:03:10.000> is<00:03:10.180> possible

00:03:10.650 --> 00:03:10.660 
with a solution and this is possible

00:03:10.660 --> 00:03:12.930 
with a solution and this is possible
because<00:03:10.840> the<00:03:11.080> ballast<00:03:11.620> tank<00:03:11.860> and<00:03:12.100> this

00:03:12.930 --> 00:03:12.940 
because the ballast tank and this

00:03:12.940 --> 00:03:18.150 
because the ballast tank and this
particular<00:03:13.450> model<00:03:13.660> is<00:03:13.900> so<00:03:14.170> large<00:03:16.620> if<00:03:17.620> I<00:03:17.950> were

00:03:18.150 --> 00:03:18.160 
particular model is so large if I were

00:03:18.160 --> 00:03:19.920 
particular model is so large if I were
to<00:03:18.310> custom<00:03:18.760> design<00:03:18.790> a<00:03:19.060> cylinder<00:03:19.600> for<00:03:19.810> this

00:03:19.920 --> 00:03:19.930 
to custom design a cylinder for this

00:03:19.930 --> 00:03:22.320 
to custom design a cylinder for this
unit<00:03:20.340> it<00:03:21.340> would<00:03:21.460> have<00:03:21.550> been<00:03:21.640> about<00:03:21.760> half<00:03:22.090> the

00:03:22.320 --> 00:03:22.330 
unit it would have been about half the

00:03:22.330 --> 00:03:24.750 
unit it would have been about half the
size<00:03:22.860> but<00:03:23.860> this<00:03:23.980> is<00:03:24.070> what<00:03:24.220> we<00:03:24.310> have<00:03:24.430> to<00:03:24.580> work

00:03:24.750 --> 00:03:24.760 
size but this is what we have to work

00:03:24.760 --> 00:03:27.300 
size but this is what we have to work
with<00:03:24.970> still<00:03:25.270> an<00:03:25.500> extremely<00:03:26.500> good<00:03:26.770> cylinder

00:03:27.300 --> 00:03:27.310 
with still an extremely good cylinder

00:03:27.310 --> 00:03:30.200 
with still an extremely good cylinder
but<00:03:27.580> ballast<00:03:28.270> tank<00:03:28.480> is<00:03:28.600> very<00:03:29.050> oversized<00:03:29.680> so

00:03:30.200 --> 00:03:30.210 
but ballast tank is very oversized so

00:03:30.210 --> 00:03:34.200 
but ballast tank is very oversized so
what<00:03:31.210> we<00:03:31.330> need<00:03:31.450> to<00:03:31.480> do<00:03:31.720> is<00:03:32.250> make<00:03:33.250> it<00:03:33.280> about<00:03:33.820> half

00:03:34.200 --> 00:03:34.210 
what we need to do is make it about half

00:03:34.210 --> 00:03:36.540 
what we need to do is make it about half
the<00:03:34.540> size<00:03:34.720> as<00:03:35.050> it<00:03:35.200> was<00:03:35.440> and<00:03:35.920> the<00:03:36.190> way<00:03:36.310> that<00:03:36.490> I

00:03:36.540 --> 00:03:36.550 
the size as it was and the way that I

00:03:36.550 --> 00:03:39.990 
the size as it was and the way that I
accomplished<00:03:37.120> that<00:03:37.150> is<00:03:37.600> I<00:03:37.810> inserted<00:03:38.290> a<00:03:39.000> rubber

00:03:39.990 --> 00:03:40.000 
accomplished that is I inserted a rubber

00:03:40.000 --> 00:03:43.199 
accomplished that is I inserted a rubber
bladder<00:03:40.830> same<00:03:41.830> ones<00:03:42.010> that<00:03:42.070> they<00:03:42.190> use<00:03:42.400> in<00:03:42.610> a

00:03:43.199 --> 00:03:43.209 
bladder same ones that they use in a

00:03:43.209 --> 00:03:46.800 
bladder same ones that they use in a
blood<00:03:43.450> pressure<00:03:43.660> cuff<00:03:45.000> this<00:03:46.000> is<00:03:46.180> a<00:03:46.209> hose<00:03:46.480> that

00:03:46.800 --> 00:03:46.810 
blood pressure cuff this is a hose that

00:03:46.810 --> 00:03:48.480 
blood pressure cuff this is a hose that
comes<00:03:47.020> out<00:03:47.260> the<00:03:47.410> bottom<00:03:47.740> so<00:03:47.920> basically<00:03:48.280> what

00:03:48.480 --> 00:03:48.490 
comes out the bottom so basically what

00:03:48.490 --> 00:03:49.410 
comes out the bottom so basically what
I'm<00:03:48.550> going<00:03:48.670> to<00:03:48.700> do<00:03:48.820> I'm<00:03:48.910> going<00:03:49.000> to<00:03:49.060> pop<00:03:49.270> this

00:03:49.410 --> 00:03:49.420 
I'm going to do I'm going to pop this

00:03:49.420 --> 00:03:52.920 
I'm going to do I'm going to pop this
back<00:03:49.690> into<00:03:50.290> the<00:03:50.410> water<00:03:51.180> get<00:03:52.180> any<00:03:52.330> completely

00:03:52.920 --> 00:03:52.930 
back into the water get any completely

00:03:52.930 --> 00:03:55.410 
back into the water get any completely
submerged<00:03:53.500> trim<00:03:54.010> and<00:03:54.640> I'm<00:03:54.730> going<00:03:54.910> to<00:03:54.970> blow<00:03:55.209> in

00:03:55.410 --> 00:03:55.420 
submerged trim and I'm going to blow in

00:03:55.420 --> 00:03:57.150 
submerged trim and I'm going to blow in
the<00:03:55.510> end<00:03:55.660> of<00:03:55.780> this<00:03:55.870> tube<00:03:56.170> and<00:03:56.470> the<00:03:56.620> bladder

00:03:57.150 --> 00:03:57.160 
the end of this tube and the bladder

00:03:57.160 --> 00:04:00.150 
the end of this tube and the bladder
will<00:03:57.520> inflate<00:03:58.350> until<00:03:59.350> it<00:03:59.470> gets<00:03:59.650> to<00:03:59.830> the<00:03:59.860> point

00:04:00.150 --> 00:04:00.160 
will inflate until it gets to the point

00:04:00.160 --> 00:04:03.449 
will inflate until it gets to the point
that<00:04:00.400> it<00:04:00.580> is<00:04:00.730> at<00:04:01.170> the<00:04:02.170> perfect<00:04:02.560> buoyancy<00:04:03.310> that

00:04:03.449 --> 00:04:03.459 
that it is at the perfect buoyancy that

00:04:03.459 --> 00:04:04.860 
that it is at the perfect buoyancy that
I'm<00:04:03.550> trying<00:04:03.850> to<00:04:03.940> achieve<00:04:04.150> and<00:04:04.630> for<00:04:04.780> this

00:04:04.860 --> 00:04:04.870 
I'm trying to achieve and for this

00:04:04.870 --> 00:04:07.440 
I'm trying to achieve and for this
particular<00:04:05.470> model<00:04:05.739> and<00:04:05.950> as<00:04:06.489> the<00:04:06.790> the<00:04:07.300> new

00:04:07.440 --> 00:04:07.450 
particular model and as the the new

00:04:07.450 --> 00:04:09.420 
particular model and as the the new
owner<00:04:07.690> is<00:04:07.870> is<00:04:08.350> just<00:04:08.650> getting<00:04:08.920> started<00:04:09.040> with

00:04:09.420 --> 00:04:09.430 
owner is is just getting started with

00:04:09.430 --> 00:04:12.650 
owner is is just getting started with
this<00:04:09.640> that<00:04:10.390> is<00:04:10.540> going<00:04:10.780> to<00:04:10.900> be<00:04:11.050> a<00:04:11.080> just<00:04:11.739> slightly

00:04:12.650 --> 00:04:12.660 
this that is going to be a just slightly

00:04:12.660 --> 00:04:14.940 
this that is going to be a just slightly
positively<00:04:13.660> buoyant<00:04:13.930> so<00:04:14.440> that<00:04:14.590> when<00:04:14.739> the

00:04:14.940 --> 00:04:14.950 
positively buoyant so that when the

00:04:14.950 --> 00:04:17.390 
positively buoyant so that when the
ballast<00:04:15.850> tank<00:04:16.090> is<00:04:16.270> completely<00:04:16.450> full

00:04:17.390 --> 00:04:17.400 
ballast tank is completely full

00:04:17.400 --> 00:04:19.530 
ballast tank is completely full
basically<00:04:18.400> the<00:04:18.580> sail<00:04:18.820> will<00:04:19.090> still<00:04:19.390> be

00:04:19.530 --> 00:04:19.540 
basically the sail will still be

00:04:19.540 --> 00:04:20.880 
basically the sail will still be
sticking<00:04:20.020> out<00:04:20.169> so<00:04:20.200> if<00:04:20.470> there<00:04:20.620> are<00:04:20.709> any

00:04:20.880 --> 00:04:20.890 
sticking out so if there are any

00:04:20.890 --> 00:04:22.770 
sticking out so if there are any
problems<00:04:21.210> underneath<00:04:22.210> the<00:04:22.330> water<00:04:22.540> that<00:04:22.720> he

00:04:22.770 --> 00:04:22.780 
problems underneath the water that he

00:04:22.780 --> 00:04:24.480 
problems underneath the water that he
runs<00:04:22.930> into<00:04:23.230> he<00:04:23.560> can<00:04:23.710> just<00:04:23.890> simply<00:04:24.190> take<00:04:24.370> his

00:04:24.480 --> 00:04:24.490 
runs into he can just simply take his

00:04:24.490 --> 00:04:26.730 
runs into he can just simply take his
hands<00:04:25.330> off<00:04:25.450> the<00:04:25.630> control<00:04:26.020> put<00:04:26.260> everything<00:04:26.500> to

00:04:26.730 --> 00:04:26.740 
hands off the control put everything to

00:04:26.740 --> 00:04:28.650 
hands off the control put everything to
zero<00:04:27.010> and<00:04:27.310> theoretically<00:04:27.850> the<00:04:28.090> model<00:04:28.390> should

00:04:28.650 --> 00:04:28.660 
zero and theoretically the model should

00:04:28.660 --> 00:04:38.370 
zero and theoretically the model should
surface<00:04:29.320> by<00:04:29.830> itself<00:04:31.350> this<00:04:32.350> is<00:04:32.680> the<00:04:33.280> snort<00:04:37.380> tube

00:04:38.370 --> 00:04:38.380 
surface by itself this is the snort tube

00:04:38.380 --> 00:04:40.230 
surface by itself this is the snort tube
that<00:04:38.680> I<00:04:38.740> was<00:04:38.950> mentioning<00:04:39.430> to<00:04:39.700> you<00:04:39.790> earlier<00:04:40.120> and

00:04:40.230 --> 00:04:40.240 
that I was mentioning to you earlier and

00:04:40.240 --> 00:04:41.790 
that I was mentioning to you earlier and
again<00:04:40.270> this<00:04:40.570> just<00:04:40.810> gets<00:04:41.020> inserted<00:04:41.320> into<00:04:41.680> the

00:04:41.790 --> 00:04:41.800 
again this just gets inserted into the

00:04:41.800 --> 00:04:45.210 
again this just gets inserted into the
sail<00:04:42.039> pops<00:04:42.970> out<00:04:43.210> the<00:04:43.240> top<00:04:44.140> looks<00:04:44.800> something

00:04:45.210 --> 00:04:45.220 
sail pops out the top looks something

00:04:45.220 --> 00:04:45.750 
sail pops out the top looks something
like

00:04:45.750 --> 00:04:45.760 
like

00:04:45.760 --> 00:04:49.620
