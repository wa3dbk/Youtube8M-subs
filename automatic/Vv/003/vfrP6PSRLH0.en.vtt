00:02:52.570 --> 00:02:54.000 
gonna let that sit for 15 minutes we're
not<00:02:52.690> going<00:02:52.840> to<00:02:52.900> do<00:02:53.020> that<00:02:53.170> if<00:02:53.350> you<00:02:53.470> obviously

00:02:54.000 --> 00:02:54.010 
not going to do that if you obviously

00:02:54.010 --> 00:02:55.230 
not going to do that if you obviously
I'm<00:02:54.100> not<00:02:54.220> going<00:02:54.370> to<00:02:54.610> sit<00:02:54.790> here<00:02:54.910> and<00:02:55.060> watch<00:02:55.209> that

00:02:55.230 --> 00:02:55.240 
I'm not going to sit here and watch that

00:02:55.240 --> 00:02:57.030 
I'm not going to sit here and watch that
so<00:02:55.720> that's<00:02:55.900> why<00:02:55.990> I<00:02:56.050> have<00:02:56.230> other<00:02:56.440> sponges<00:02:56.920> and

00:02:57.030 --> 00:02:57.040 
so that's why I have other sponges and

00:02:57.040 --> 00:03:03.000 
so that's why I have other sponges and
such<00:02:57.280> to<00:02:59.250> use<00:03:00.250> as<00:03:00.640> Devils<00:03:01.510> so<00:03:02.170> this<00:03:02.410> is<00:03:02.680> how<00:03:02.950> you

00:03:03.000 --> 00:03:03.010 
such to use as Devils so this is how you

00:03:03.010 --> 00:03:07.410 
such to use as Devils so this is how you
probably<00:03:03.670> I<00:03:04.620> started<00:03:05.620> properly<00:03:06.420> cleaning

00:03:07.410 --> 00:03:07.420 
probably I started properly cleaning

00:03:07.420 --> 00:03:11.670 
probably I started properly cleaning
once<00:03:08.380> that<00:03:08.680> soaks<00:03:09.040> for<00:03:09.310> 15<00:03:09.730> minutes<00:03:10.560> we're<00:03:11.560> not

00:03:11.670 --> 00:03:11.680 
once that soaks for 15 minutes we're not

00:03:11.680 --> 00:03:13.590 
once that soaks for 15 minutes we're not
gonna<00:03:11.800> sell<00:03:12.070> it<00:03:12.100> for<00:03:12.220> 30<00:03:12.640> minutes<00:03:12.910> that<00:03:13.120> is<00:03:13.239> not

00:03:13.590 --> 00:03:13.600 
gonna sell it for 30 minutes that is not

00:03:13.600 --> 00:03:18.720 
gonna sell it for 30 minutes that is not
necessary<00:03:14.140> you<00:03:15.690> are<00:03:16.690> going<00:03:17.290> to<00:03:17.730> squeeze

00:03:18.720 --> 00:03:18.730 
necessary you are going to squeeze

00:03:18.730 --> 00:03:22.949 
necessary you are going to squeeze
everything<00:03:19.570> out<00:03:19.959> of<00:03:19.989> it<00:03:20.370> and<00:03:21.840> you're<00:03:22.840> gonna

00:03:22.949 --> 00:03:22.959 
everything out of it and you're gonna

00:03:22.959 --> 00:03:29.759 
everything out of it and you're gonna
rinse<00:03:24.300> the<00:03:25.300> sponge<00:03:26.080> a<00:03:27.390> few<00:03:28.390> times<00:03:28.660> to<00:03:29.110> get<00:03:29.590> all

00:03:29.759 --> 00:03:29.769 
rinse the sponge a few times to get all

00:03:29.769 --> 00:03:32.910 
rinse the sponge a few times to get all
that<00:03:29.920> teacher<00:03:30.160> al<00:03:30.430> out<00:03:30.730> of<00:03:31.200> the<00:03:32.200> sponge<00:03:32.620> so

00:03:32.910 --> 00:03:32.920 
that teacher al out of the sponge so

00:03:32.920 --> 00:03:35.220 
that teacher al out of the sponge so
you're<00:03:33.070> just<00:03:33.250> gonna<00:03:33.459> keep<00:03:33.670> I<00:03:34.060> do<00:03:34.660> this<00:03:34.959> under<00:03:35.200> a

00:03:35.220 --> 00:03:35.230 
you're just gonna keep I do this under a

00:03:35.230 --> 00:03:38.130 
you're just gonna keep I do this under a
running<00:03:35.530> tap<00:03:35.769> it's<00:03:36.250> just<00:03:36.459> that<00:03:36.750> for<00:03:37.750> the<00:03:37.810> video

00:03:38.130 --> 00:03:38.140 
running tap it's just that for the video

00:03:38.140 --> 00:03:43.380 
running tap it's just that for the video
it's<00:03:38.560> easier<00:03:39.220> to<00:03:39.489> just<00:03:39.940> do<00:03:40.180> it<00:03:40.209> with<00:03:42.390> bottled

00:03:43.380 --> 00:03:43.390 
it's easier to just do it with bottled

00:03:43.390 --> 00:03:48.530 
it's easier to just do it with bottled
water

00:03:48.530 --> 00:03:48.540 

00:03:48.540 --> 00:03:56.280 

once<00:03:49.540> it<00:03:50.019> is<00:03:50.519> cleaned<00:03:55.080> you're<00:03:56.080> going<00:03:56.230> to

00:03:56.280 --> 00:03:56.290 
once it is cleaned you're going to

00:03:56.290 --> 00:03:58.610 
once it is cleaned you're going to
squeeze<00:03:56.650> out<00:03:56.860> all<00:03:57.070> the<00:03:57.310> excess<00:03:57.610> water<00:03:57.880> and

00:03:58.610 --> 00:03:58.620 
squeeze out all the excess water and

00:03:58.620 --> 00:04:02.910 
squeeze out all the excess water and
that's<00:03:59.620> ready<00:03:59.890> to<00:03:59.980> be<00:04:00.190> used<00:04:01.320> so<00:04:02.320> all<00:04:02.590> you<00:04:02.739> have

00:04:02.910 --> 00:04:02.920 
that's ready to be used so all you have

00:04:02.920 --> 00:04:05.550 
that's ready to be used so all you have
to<00:04:03.160> do<00:04:03.310> it's<00:04:03.640> already<00:04:03.940> wet<00:04:04.180> the<00:04:04.870> sponge<00:04:04.930> always

00:04:05.550 --> 00:04:05.560 
to do it's already wet the sponge always

00:04:05.560 --> 00:04:08.250 
to do it's already wet the sponge always
goes<00:04:05.769> into<00:04:06.130> you<00:04:06.250> wets<00:04:06.459> if<00:04:06.790> it's<00:04:07.720> too<00:04:07.959> big<00:04:08.230> you

00:04:08.250 --> 00:04:08.260 
goes into you wets if it's too big you

00:04:08.260 --> 00:04:11.190 
goes into you wets if it's too big you
could<00:04:08.850> scrunch<00:04:09.850> it<00:04:10.060> up<00:04:10.150> like<00:04:10.360> that<00:04:10.390> and<00:04:10.780> put<00:04:11.080> it

00:04:11.190 --> 00:04:11.200 
could scrunch it up like that and put it

00:04:11.200 --> 00:04:14.039 
could scrunch it up like that and put it
up<00:04:11.350> you<00:04:11.560> so<00:04:12.190> you<00:04:12.250> just<00:04:12.549> insert<00:04:12.910> it<00:04:12.940> as<00:04:13.570> far<00:04:13.870> back

00:04:14.039 --> 00:04:14.049 
up you so you just insert it as far back

00:04:14.049 --> 00:04:17.699 
up you so you just insert it as far back
as<00:04:14.380> possible<00:04:16.019> obviously<00:04:17.019> the<00:04:17.140> further<00:04:17.350> back

00:04:17.699 --> 00:04:17.709 
as possible obviously the further back

00:04:17.709 --> 00:04:19.229 
as possible obviously the further back
the<00:04:17.919> more<00:04:18.070> it's<00:04:18.190> going<00:04:18.310> to<00:04:18.370> travel<00:04:18.669> so<00:04:19.090> the

00:04:19.229 --> 00:04:19.239 
the more it's going to travel so the

00:04:19.239 --> 00:04:25.040 
the more it's going to travel so the
longer<00:04:19.540> you<00:04:19.600> keep<00:04:19.930> it<00:04:20.140> it<00:04:21.840> if<00:04:23.220> the<00:04:24.220> small

00:04:25.040 --> 00:04:25.050 
longer you keep it it if the small

00:04:25.050 --> 00:04:28.530 
longer you keep it it if the small
sponges<00:04:26.050> are<00:04:26.229> too<00:04:26.470> small<00:04:26.770> for<00:04:26.979> you<00:04:27.130> it<00:04:27.520> is<00:04:27.940> okay

00:04:28.530 --> 00:04:28.540 
sponges are too small for you it is okay

00:04:28.540 --> 00:04:31.440 
sponges are too small for you it is okay
to<00:04:28.600> use<00:04:28.810> two<00:04:29.320> sponges<00:04:29.770> at<00:04:29.919> the<00:04:30.040> same<00:04:30.280> time<00:04:30.580> so

00:04:31.440 --> 00:04:31.450 
to use two sponges at the same time so

00:04:31.450 --> 00:04:34.159 
to use two sponges at the same time so
if<00:04:31.599> you're<00:04:31.780> having<00:04:31.960> a<00:04:32.169> heavy<00:04:32.410> day<00:04:32.650> flow<00:04:33.039> and

00:04:34.159 --> 00:04:34.169 
if you're having a heavy day flow and

00:04:34.169 --> 00:04:36.210 
if you're having a heavy day flow and
you<00:04:35.169> want<00:04:35.440> you<00:04:35.740> don't<00:04:35.919> have

00:04:36.210 --> 00:04:36.220 
you want you don't have

00:04:36.220 --> 00:04:38.310 
you want you don't have
a<00:04:36.250> large<00:04:36.580> one<00:04:36.850> you've<00:04:37.420> actually<00:04:37.630> used<00:04:38.080> two

00:04:38.310 --> 00:04:38.320 
a large one you've actually used two

00:04:38.320 --> 00:04:41.280 
a large one you've actually used two
small<00:04:38.620> ones<00:04:39.060> just<00:04:40.060> do<00:04:40.180> the<00:04:40.270> same<00:04:40.480> meaning<00:04:40.960> as

00:04:41.280 --> 00:04:41.290 
small ones just do the same meaning as

00:04:41.290 --> 00:04:44.760 
small ones just do the same meaning as
you<00:04:41.920> would<00:04:42.370> with<00:04:42.970> the<00:04:43.000> first<00:04:43.300> one<00:04:43.540> then<00:04:44.170> what

00:04:44.760 --> 00:04:44.770 
you would with the first one then what

00:04:44.770 --> 00:04:46.890 
you would with the first one then what

00:04:46.890 --> 00:04:46.900 
the second one take out the water and

00:04:46.900 --> 00:04:50.880 
the second one take out the water and
put<00:04:47.290> two<00:04:47.440> of<00:04:47.590> you<00:04:48.570> the<00:04:49.570> second<00:04:49.990> one<00:04:50.170> coming<00:04:50.680> out

00:04:50.880 --> 00:04:50.890 
put two of you the second one coming out

00:04:50.890 --> 00:04:53.670 
put two of you the second one coming out
will<00:04:51.370> be<00:04:51.490> a<00:04:51.520> little<00:04:51.880> bit<00:04:52.000> further<00:04:52.300> in<00:04:52.600> so<00:04:53.230> just

00:04:53.670 --> 00:04:53.680 
will be a little bit further in so just

00:04:53.680 --> 00:04:54.960 
will be a little bit further in so just
take<00:04:53.890> your<00:04:54.040> time<00:04:54.250> with<00:04:54.490> it<00:04:54.550> if<00:04:54.820> you're

00:04:54.960 --> 00:04:54.970 
take your time with it if you're

00:04:54.970 --> 00:04:57.570 
take your time with it if you're
stressed<00:04:55.330> out<00:04:55.600> it's<00:04:55.990> gonna<00:04:56.200> stay<00:04:56.500> up<00:04:56.710> there<00:04:57.010> so

00:04:57.570 --> 00:04:57.580 
stressed out it's gonna stay up there so

00:04:57.580 --> 00:04:59.130 
stressed out it's gonna stay up there so
all<00:04:57.730> you<00:04:57.880> have<00:04:58.060> to<00:04:58.210> do<00:04:58.360> is<00:04:58.600> wait<00:04:58.930> a<00:04:58.990> couple

00:04:59.130 --> 00:04:59.140 
all you have to do is wait a couple

00:04:59.140 --> 00:05:03.240 
all you have to do is wait a couple
hours<00:04:59.380> no<00:04:59.710> travel<00:05:00.190> back<00:05:00.340> down<00:05:00.370> by<00:05:00.790> itself<00:05:02.250> so

00:05:03.240 --> 00:05:03.250 
hours no travel back down by itself so

00:05:03.250 --> 00:05:05.580 
hours no travel back down by itself so
that's<00:05:03.490> how<00:05:03.670> you<00:05:03.730> clean<00:05:04.090> it<00:05:04.270> and<00:05:04.690> that's<00:05:05.440> how

00:05:05.580 --> 00:05:05.590 
that's how you clean it and that's how

00:05:05.590 --> 00:05:06.930 
that's how you clean it and that's how
you<00:05:05.650> use<00:05:05.890> it

00:05:06.930 --> 00:05:06.940 
you use it

00:05:06.940 --> 00:05:09.960 
you use it
it's<00:05:07.630> just<00:05:08.190> squeezing<00:05:09.190> the<00:05:09.310> excess<00:05:09.610> water<00:05:09.790> out

00:05:09.960 --> 00:05:09.970 
it's just squeezing the excess water out

00:05:09.970 --> 00:05:13.080 
it's just squeezing the excess water out
and<00:05:10.300> putting<00:05:10.690> it<00:05:10.870> in<00:05:11.730> you<00:05:12.730> don't<00:05:12.850> have<00:05:13.000> to

00:05:13.080 --> 00:05:13.090 
and putting it in you don't have to

00:05:13.090 --> 00:05:16.110 
and putting it in you don't have to
