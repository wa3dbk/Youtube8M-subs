00:00:00.380 --> 00:00:05.220
 hello, I'm jeremy boyce teacher, I'm 

00:00:03.240 --> 00:00:07.140
 here at the federal university of mining and 

00:00:05.220 --> 00:00:08.970
 I would like to talk to you today 

00:00:07.140 --> 00:00:11.370
 about some events related to the 

00:00:08.970 --> 00:00:13.980
 formation of the human heart she has 

00:00:11.370 --> 00:00:17.130
 here before me a model in which the 

00:00:13.980 --> 00:00:20.160
 anatomical model in which to present the 

00:00:17.130 --> 00:00:23.490
 adult heart can when analyzing 

00:00:20.160 --> 00:00:26.250
 this model observes that the heart is 

00:00:23.490 --> 00:00:28.710
 located in the middle of the rib cage 

00:00:26.250 --> 00:00:31.769
 flanked by both lungs will open 

00:00:28.710 --> 00:00:35.460
 here to be able to see below the heart 

00:00:31.769 --> 00:00:38.250
 here we have the presence of the diaphragm or 

00:00:35.460 --> 00:00:40.410
 withdraw so we can access the 

00:00:38.250 --> 00:00:43.710
 heart 

00:00:40.410 --> 00:00:46.410
 I'm going to remove my heart from here. 

00:00:43.710 --> 00:00:49.829
 the thick gauges vessel arrives at 

00:00:46.410 --> 00:00:54.120
 heart is the heart is and ricardo by 

00:00:49.829 --> 00:00:56.969
 blood that comes from the superior vena cava that 

00:00:54.120 --> 00:01:00.180
 will give the blood that comes from the head and 

00:00:56.969 --> 00:01:01.890
 neck and the inferior vena cava that 

00:01:00.180 --> 00:01:04.049
 will take the heart blood that is 

00:01:01.890 --> 00:01:06.570
 from the bottom of the body 

00:01:04.049 --> 00:01:09.180
 blood will come out of the heart because of 

00:01:06.570 --> 00:01:12.689
 artery and large caliber 

00:01:09.180 --> 00:01:14.939
 the largest diameter area of ​​the Roman goal 

00:01:12.689 --> 00:01:21.479
 It's time to take a look at the 

00:01:14.939 --> 00:01:23.880
 heart observing the heart's interior 

00:01:21.479 --> 00:01:28.439
 we can see that it is formed by four 

00:01:23.880 --> 00:01:32.670
 cameras one two three four 

00:01:28.439 --> 00:01:35.250
 the two above are actress to the right 

00:01:32.670 --> 00:01:37.799
 the left trio and the bottom two are 

00:01:35.250 --> 00:01:40.829
 the right and left ventricles 

00:01:37.799 --> 00:01:44.130
 we can see that this region here 

00:01:40.829 --> 00:01:47.220
 The left region is thicker because 

00:01:44.130 --> 00:01:51.299
 here with the blood is must be propelled 

00:01:47.220 --> 00:01:53.880
 from here for the best 

00:01:51.299 --> 00:01:57.420
 whole body and here is an area of 

00:01:53.880 --> 00:01:59.490
 receiving blood and is through the 

00:01:57.420 --> 00:02:01.950
 What blood will it be to take only to 

00:01:59.490 --> 00:02:03.450
 the lungs through the arteries here 

00:02:01.950 --> 00:02:06.000
 coronary 

00:02:03.450 --> 00:02:07.000
 In addition, the presence of a 

00:02:06.000 --> 00:02:09.950
 series of studies 

00:02:07.000 --> 00:02:12.590
 that prevent the backflow of 

00:02:09.950 --> 00:02:16.040
 blood and controls the 

00:02:12.590 --> 00:02:18.790
 to specific locations 

00:02:16.040 --> 00:02:22.040
 for example here we have the back 

00:02:18.790 --> 00:02:25.190
 called tricuspid she saves 

00:02:22.040 --> 00:02:28.070
 tricuspid she will control the passage 

00:02:25.190 --> 00:02:31.520
 blood from the right atrium to the 

00:02:28.070 --> 00:02:33.860
 Right ventricle on the side of here 

00:02:31.520 --> 00:02:36.410
 on the left side the mitral valve that 

00:02:33.860 --> 00:02:40.340
 controls the passage of blood from the atrium 

00:02:36.410 --> 00:02:43.220
 left into the left ventricle and the 

00:02:40.340 --> 00:02:45.890
 subsequently forwarded via the 

00:02:43.220 --> 00:02:49.250
 to discharge the rest of the organism 

00:02:45.890 --> 00:02:52.820
 we have still here valve is present in the 

00:02:49.250 --> 00:02:56.150
 aorta valvar the optic and another valve 

00:02:52.820 --> 00:02:58.959
 here in the region by Mona Valva 

00:02:56.150 --> 00:02:58.959
 pulmonary valve
