entirely sure what they're called but I

00:00:44.960 --> 00:00:46.450 
entirely sure what they're called but I
basically<00:00:45.199> went<00:00:45.500> with<00:00:45.680> a<00:00:45.710> look<00:00:46.010> like<00:00:46.250> that

00:00:46.450 --> 00:00:46.460 
basically went with a look like that

00:00:46.460 --> 00:00:49.030 
basically went with a look like that
because<00:00:46.760> this<00:00:47.030> car<00:00:47.360> has<00:00:47.600> like<00:00:47.839> as<00:00:48.019> that<00:00:48.799> race

00:00:49.030 --> 00:00:49.040 
because this car has like as that race

00:00:49.040 --> 00:00:52.299 
because this car has like as that race
car<00:00:49.400> look<00:00:49.729> to<00:00:49.970> it<00:00:50.229> so<00:00:51.229> I<00:00:51.260> think<00:00:51.559> it's<00:00:51.860> I<00:00:52.070> mean

00:00:52.299 --> 00:00:52.309 
car look to it so I think it's I mean

00:00:52.309 --> 00:00:54.759 
car look to it so I think it's I mean
it's<00:00:52.339> it's<00:00:52.670> basically<00:00:53.269> a<00:00:53.390> cheetah<00:00:53.780> but<00:00:54.650> it's

00:00:54.759 --> 00:00:54.769 
it's it's basically a cheetah but it's

00:00:54.769 --> 00:00:56.439 
it's it's basically a cheetah but it's
upgraded<00:00:55.010> i'm<00:00:55.460> pretty<00:00:55.699> sure<00:00:55.879> both<00:00:56.119> the

00:00:56.439 --> 00:00:56.449 
upgraded i'm pretty sure both the

00:00:56.449 --> 00:00:59.439 
upgraded i'm pretty sure both the
cheetah<00:00:56.690> and<00:00:57.019> the<00:00:57.110> Turismo<00:00:57.500> or<00:00:57.650> Ferraris<00:00:58.449> this

00:00:59.439 --> 00:00:59.449 
cheetah and the Turismo or Ferraris this

00:00:59.449 --> 00:01:01.660 
cheetah and the Turismo or Ferraris this
one<00:00:59.690> has<00:00:59.900> the<00:01:00.080> same<00:01:00.350> like<00:01:00.650> it<00:01:00.890> has<00:01:01.159> the<00:01:01.339> plate

00:01:01.660 --> 00:01:01.670 
one has the same like it has the plate

00:01:01.670 --> 00:01:03.820 
one has the same like it has the plate
across<00:01:02.030> the<00:01:02.269> bottom<00:01:02.449> so<00:01:03.049> you<00:01:03.080> don't<00:01:03.470> see<00:01:03.619> any

00:01:03.820 --> 00:01:03.830 
across the bottom so you don't see any

00:01:03.830 --> 00:01:07.300 
across the bottom so you don't see any
of<00:01:03.949> the<00:01:04.040> nothing's<00:01:04.909> exposed<00:01:05.390> underneath<00:01:06.310> they

00:01:07.300 --> 00:01:07.310 
of the nothing's exposed underneath they

00:01:07.310 --> 00:01:10.300 
of the nothing's exposed underneath they

00:02:09.400 --> 00:02:09.410 
the best and then for the secondary I

00:02:09.410 --> 00:02:11.230 
the best and then for the secondary I
would<00:02:09.619> either<00:02:09.710> go<00:02:09.920> like<00:02:10.160> with<00:02:10.340> a<00:02:10.369> white<00:02:10.759> or

00:02:11.230 --> 00:02:11.240 
would either go like with a white or

00:02:11.240 --> 00:02:14.170 
would either go like with a white or
like<00:02:11.840> a<00:02:11.870> gray<00:02:12.440> or<00:02:12.950> maybe<00:02:13.159> a<00:02:13.250> black<00:02:13.519> but<00:02:13.940> in<00:02:14.060> this

00:02:14.170 --> 00:02:14.180 
like a gray or maybe a black but in this

00:02:14.180 --> 00:02:15.699 
like a gray or maybe a black but in this
case<00:02:14.390> I<00:02:14.599> went<00:02:14.780> red<00:02:15.019> with<00:02:15.260> the<00:02:15.500> white

00:02:15.699 --> 00:02:15.709 
case I went red with the white

00:02:15.709 --> 00:02:17.770 
case I went red with the white
background<00:02:16.209> also<00:02:17.209> for<00:02:17.450> the<00:02:17.510> rain

00:02:17.770 --> 00:02:17.780 
background also for the rain

00:02:17.780 --> 00:02:20.760 
background also for the rain
times<00:02:17.870> we<00:02:18.500> did<00:02:18.890> the<00:02:19.010> high-end<00:02:19.459> rims<00:02:19.760> and<00:02:20.150> I

00:02:20.760 --> 00:02:20.770 
times we did the high-end rims and I

00:02:20.770 --> 00:02:23.320 
times we did the high-end rims and I
believe<00:02:21.770> your<00:02:22.010> second<00:02:22.459> or<00:02:22.550> your<00:02:22.610> rim<00:02:22.970> should

00:02:23.320 --> 00:02:23.330 
believe your second or your rim should

00:02:23.330 --> 00:02:25.480 
believe your second or your rim should
match<00:02:23.540> your<00:02:23.780> secondary<00:02:24.380> it<00:02:24.890> kind<00:02:25.220> of<00:02:25.280> adds

00:02:25.480 --> 00:02:25.490 
match your secondary it kind of adds

00:02:25.490 --> 00:02:27.790 
match your secondary it kind of adds
more<00:02:25.940> of<00:02:26.120> the<00:02:26.300> color<00:02:26.540> so<00:02:27.110> that<00:02:27.140> the<00:02:27.350> car<00:02:27.590> is

00:02:27.790 --> 00:02:27.800 
more of the color so that the car is

00:02:27.800 --> 00:02:30.850 
more of the color so that the car is
more<00:02:28.040> balanced<00:02:28.640> out<00:02:29.020> now<00:02:30.020> it's<00:02:30.290> it's<00:02:30.560> up<00:02:30.709> to

00:02:30.850 --> 00:02:30.860 
more balanced out now it's it's up to
