I want to come back to this main pleat

00:02:21.560 --> 00:02:25.190 
I want to come back to this main pleat
but<00:02:22.560> again<00:02:22.860> just<00:02:23.640> look<00:02:24.000> at<00:02:24.510> the<00:02:24.690> condition

00:02:25.190 --> 00:02:25.200 
but again just look at the condition

00:02:25.200 --> 00:02:30.410 
but again just look at the condition
that<00:02:25.560> this<00:02:25.740> thing<00:02:25.950> is<00:02:26.070> in<00:02:27.560> scratches<00:02:29.210> gold<00:02:30.210> is

00:02:30.410 --> 00:02:30.420 
that this thing is in scratches gold is

00:02:30.420 --> 00:02:33.710 
that this thing is in scratches gold is
strong<00:02:30.750> and<00:02:31.740> down<00:02:32.220> the<00:02:32.370> crevices<00:02:32.910> I<00:02:33.060> mean<00:02:33.210> it

00:02:33.710 --> 00:02:33.720 
strong and down the crevices I mean it

00:02:33.720 --> 00:02:35.270 
strong and down the crevices I mean it
could<00:02:33.900> stand<00:02:34.050> to<00:02:34.200> be<00:02:34.230> polished<00:02:34.770> up<00:02:34.920> a<00:02:35.070> little

00:02:35.270 --> 00:02:35.280 
could stand to be polished up a little

00:02:35.280 --> 00:02:39.800 
could stand to be polished up a little
bit<00:02:35.580> but<00:02:36.000> I<00:02:36.270> mean<00:02:36.870> overall<00:02:37.910> this<00:02:38.910> is<00:02:39.120> this

00:02:39.800 --> 00:02:39.810 
bit but I mean overall this is this

00:02:39.810 --> 00:02:41.810 
bit but I mean overall this is this
looks<00:02:40.140> better<00:02:40.350> than<00:02:40.650> most<00:02:40.920> new<00:02:41.220> belts<00:02:41.580> on<00:02:41.730> the

00:02:41.810 --> 00:02:41.820 
looks better than most new belts on the

00:02:41.820 --> 00:02:50.000 
looks better than most new belts on the
market<00:02:47.300> all<00:02:48.300> right<00:02:48.570> I'm<00:02:49.380> gonna<00:02:49.530> get<00:02:49.710> back<00:02:49.860> to

00:02:50.000 --> 00:02:50.010 
market all right I'm gonna get back to

00:02:50.010 --> 00:02:51.620 
market all right I'm gonna get back to
this<00:02:50.130> main<00:02:50.400> plate<00:02:50.640> because<00:02:50.970> this<00:02:51.240> was<00:02:51.390> one<00:02:51.570> of

00:02:51.620 --> 00:02:51.630 
this main plate because this was one of

00:02:51.630 --> 00:02:53.590 
this main plate because this was one of
the<00:02:51.720> first<00:02:51.930> ones<00:02:52.170> that<00:02:52.230> we<00:02:52.380> did<00:02:52.590> with<00:02:52.830> our

00:02:53.590 --> 00:02:53.600 
the first ones that we did with our

00:02:53.600 --> 00:02:57.790 
the first ones that we did with our
innovative<00:02:54.860> negative<00:02:55.860> space<00:02:56.280> and<00:02:57.120> I'm<00:02:57.240> gonna

00:02:57.790 --> 00:02:57.800 
innovative negative space and I'm gonna

00:02:57.800 --> 00:03:00.650 
innovative negative space and I'm gonna
explain<00:02:58.800> that<00:02:58.860> concept<00:02:59.130> to<00:02:59.610> you<00:02:59.730> first<00:03:00.540> of<00:03:00.630> all
