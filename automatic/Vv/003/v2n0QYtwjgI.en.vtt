00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.560
 in this video I'll show you how 

00:00:02.010 --> 00:00:06.540
 prepare the paste the paste is a 

00:00:04.560 --> 00:00:09.150
 cheap natural glue that 

00:00:06.540 --> 00:00:10.559
 we prepare at home to make piñatas 

00:00:09.150 --> 00:00:14.630
 It also helps us to perform 

00:00:10.559 --> 00:00:17.960
 crafts in cardboard or paper 

00:00:14.630 --> 00:00:20.929
 let's occupy a liter of water 

00:00:17.960 --> 00:00:22.669
 a cup of flour is the flour that 

00:00:20.929 --> 00:00:25.460
 we commonly use to do the 

00:00:22.669 --> 00:00:29.719
 tortillas or cakes 2 teaspoons 

00:00:25.460 --> 00:00:31.969
 of sugar a pinch of salt and optional is 

00:00:29.719 --> 00:00:33.890
 a teaspoon of vinegar if you 

00:00:31.969 --> 00:00:35.870
 They want the glue are preserved 

00:00:33.890 --> 00:00:37.940
 for several days they will put a 

00:00:35.870 --> 00:00:39.620
 teaspoon of vinegar as a preservative 

00:00:37.940 --> 00:00:42.050
 but if the paste is going to use it 

00:00:39.620 --> 00:00:44.720
 all the same day there is no point in putting him 

00:00:42.050 --> 00:00:47.510
 vinegar in the liter of water we will 

00:00:44.720 --> 00:00:49.790
 contribute approximately one cup if 

00:00:47.510 --> 00:00:51.800
 they like to measure a house of my of busy and if 

00:00:49.790 --> 00:00:54.289
 do not pay and villanueva of a little bit 

00:00:51.800 --> 00:00:56.929
 more or less a cup the rest of the water 

00:00:54.289 --> 00:00:59.570
 let's put in a pot and we're going to 

00:00:56.929 --> 00:01:02.030
 put to heat let's wait for 

00:00:59.570 --> 00:01:04.280
 boil in what boils water I go to 

00:01:02.030 --> 00:01:07.100
 put the flour in the water that I put in 

00:01:04.280 --> 00:01:11.090
 the container I'm going to mix with a 

00:01:07.100 --> 00:01:13.009
 beater we are going to beat perfectly that 

00:01:11.090 --> 00:01:15.560
 dissolve the flour very well in the 

00:01:13.009 --> 00:01:17.810
 water and that we have no little ball 

00:01:15.560 --> 00:01:20.300
 no myth can we use the 

00:01:17.810 --> 00:01:22.060
 electric blender if we want with the 

00:01:20.300 --> 00:01:24.500
 manual beater 

00:01:22.060 --> 00:01:27.100
 perfectly no granite is left 

00:01:24.500 --> 00:01:29.740
 no ball 

00:01:27.100 --> 00:01:31.659
 when the water is boiling we are going to 

00:01:29.740 --> 00:01:33.470
 put in the flour that we already had 

00:01:31.659 --> 00:01:37.810
 dissolved 

00:01:33.470 --> 00:01:37.810
 and we are going to stir perfectly 

00:01:41.740 --> 00:01:46.280
 we will be stirring until 

00:01:44.140 --> 00:01:48.440
 come back to boil 

00:01:46.280 --> 00:01:51.270
 we already want it to be starting we are going to 

00:01:48.440 --> 00:01:54.179
 put the sugar 

00:01:51.270 --> 00:01:57.049
 without stopping moving and we are going to put a 

00:01:54.179 --> 00:01:57.049
 little salt 

00:01:58.370 --> 00:02:02.090
 we will keep moving when we see that 

00:02:01.310 --> 00:02:04.070
 start boiling 

00:02:02.090 --> 00:02:06.380
 let's continue beating for a minute 

00:02:04.070 --> 00:02:08.960
 approximately and then we're going to turn off 

00:02:06.380 --> 00:02:11.660
 the fire I recommend you to use 

00:02:08.960 --> 00:02:15.590
 a beater to prevent you have left 

00:02:11.660 --> 00:02:17.960
 balls in the paste we are going to beat this 

00:02:15.590 --> 00:02:20.180
 stirring and beating so that it 

00:02:17.960 --> 00:02:22.910
 undo the balls in case you 

00:02:20.180 --> 00:02:25.640
 some of the paste has already formed 

00:02:22.910 --> 00:02:27.710
 it was ready now I'm going to wait for it 

00:02:25.640 --> 00:02:29.480
 cool so you can use it when the 

00:02:27.710 --> 00:02:32.270
 paste is already cold we are going to put 

00:02:29.480 --> 00:02:34.940
 a teaspoon of vinegar I'm not going to 

00:02:32.270 --> 00:02:37.010
 use all the paste this day I go 

00:02:34.940 --> 00:02:39.530
 to use a little bit more and then 

00:02:37.010 --> 00:02:41.930
 I want to save for next week and 

00:02:39.530 --> 00:02:44.450
 I do not want to do that again, that's why I put 

00:02:41.930 --> 00:02:47.000
 the vinegar paste can last them 

00:02:44.450 --> 00:02:49.220
 easily two days at temperature 

00:02:47.000 --> 00:02:51.380
 environment or three or four days in the 

00:02:49.220 --> 00:02:53.420
 refrigerator but I want it to last me 

00:02:51.380 --> 00:02:56.570
 more time that's why I put the vinegar 

00:02:53.420 --> 00:02:59.270
 I'm going to put it in a jar to be able 

00:02:56.570 --> 00:03:02.660
 save now I already have the paste 

00:02:59.270 --> 00:03:03.500
 ready to make a piñata or to make
