00:00:04.810 --> 00:00:09.430
 over the last few years many divers yes 

00:00:07.479 --> 00:00:11.860
 they have evolved and become crossovers 

00:00:09.430 --> 00:00:13.629
 a metamorphosis that now 

00:00:11.860 --> 00:00:15.879
 also to the new generation of 

00:00:13.629 --> 00:00:18.550
 nissan x3 which has a sleeker line 

00:00:15.879 --> 00:00:21.279
 and elegant from the past to a new one 

00:00:18.550 --> 00:00:23.470
 1600 turbodiesel engine small and little 

00:00:21.279 --> 00:00:27.119
 fuel-hungry and an endowment 

00:00:23.470 --> 00:00:27.119
 richer series than ever 

00:00:27.699 --> 00:00:32.320
 just a simple glance to understand 

00:00:29.590 --> 00:00:34.719
 how changed the former trail it says 

00:00:32.320 --> 00:00:36.700
 goodbye to the edges I assure style 

00:00:34.719 --> 00:00:39.820
 of the younger sister the qashqai 

00:00:36.700 --> 00:00:41.739
 the front with a large abi and ipa motif 

00:00:39.820 --> 00:00:44.650
 muds that seem to be long-standing 

00:00:41.739 --> 00:00:46.420
 sitting in the gym with the step you take 

00:00:44.650 --> 00:00:48.250
 lengthens by about 8 cm 

00:00:46.420 --> 00:00:50.140
 the cockpit is now among the most welcoming 

00:00:48.250 --> 00:00:53.350
 of the category and space for the legs 

00:00:50.140 --> 00:00:55.829
 from record the workhorse of 

00:00:53.350 --> 00:00:58.510
 this nissan is however versatility and 

00:00:55.829 --> 00:01:01.270
 rear seats can slide 

00:00:58.510 --> 00:01:03.190
 back and forth for 26 cm and there is the 

00:01:01.270 --> 00:01:05.049
 possibility of having two additional i 

00:01:03.190 --> 00:01:08.290
 foldaway seats in the area of 

00:01:05.049 --> 00:01:10.750
 trunk for a total of seven seats 

00:01:08.290 --> 00:01:13.469
 alternatively you can travel in 5 with 

00:01:10.750 --> 00:01:16.180
 a load compartment of 550 eng 

00:01:13.469 --> 00:01:17.979
 configurable in nine different ways 

00:01:16.180 --> 00:01:20.590
 thanks to the presence of two practices and 

00:01:17.979 --> 00:01:22.450
 shelves in the front instead of the 

00:01:20.590 --> 00:01:24.790
 all eyes are for the plank that it is 

00:01:22.450 --> 00:01:27.010
 an impressive technological species area 

00:01:24.790 --> 00:01:28.570
 when in the center it houses the 7 display 

00:01:27.010 --> 00:01:30.130
 inch 

00:01:28.570 --> 00:01:32.260
 the latter represents the tip 

00:01:30.130 --> 00:01:34.290
 of the iceberg of an endowment in which 

00:01:32.260 --> 00:01:36.790
 stand out hi-tech devices of last 

00:01:34.290 --> 00:01:38.860
 generation that increase the pleasure of 

00:01:36.790 --> 00:01:40.810
 drives comfort and safety 

00:01:38.860 --> 00:01:42.909
 braking for example when there was the 

00:01:40.810 --> 00:01:44.280
 risk of a collision stabilizing 

00:01:42.909 --> 00:01:46.770
 the machine on the depressions 

00:01:44.280 --> 00:01:50.340
 alerting me if something moves into the 

00:01:46.770 --> 00:01:53.460
 surrounding space during maneuvers 

00:01:50.340 --> 00:01:55.590
 the nissan x3 2014 and built on one 

00:01:53.460 --> 00:01:57.719
 new modular platform with wide 

00:01:55.590 --> 00:02:00.149
 use of high-strength steels e 

00:01:57.719 --> 00:02:02.069
 weighs up to 90 kg less than the 

00:02:00.149 --> 00:02:04.079
 model that has flat 

00:02:02.069 --> 00:02:05.670
 another novelty of this generation e 

00:02:04.079 --> 00:02:07.920
 entry into a range of versions a 

00:02:05.670 --> 00:02:10.080
 front wheel drive side by side 

00:02:07.920 --> 00:02:14.099
 to the proven all-wheel drive all 

00:02:10.080 --> 00:02:16.290
 mode 4x4 with its three settings 

00:02:14.099 --> 00:02:17.129
 the latter allows you to do think 

00:02:16.290 --> 00:02:19.200
 off road 

00:02:17.129 --> 00:02:23.190
 also because of a minimum height from 

00:02:19.200 --> 00:02:26.430
 penalty ground 21 cm following the fashion 

00:02:23.190 --> 00:02:28.620
 rampant downsizing of engines 

00:02:26.430 --> 00:02:32.489
 nissan has it all for the moment 

00:02:28.620 --> 00:02:35.310
 1600 of both and from 130 horses and 320 myth 

00:02:32.489 --> 00:02:37.049
 put this turbodiesel to no hypothesis 

00:02:35.310 --> 00:02:39.150
 it makes us regret larger units 

00:02:37.049 --> 00:02:41.220
 much with the six-speed manual gearbox 

00:02:39.150 --> 00:02:44.340
 how that great automatic a 

00:02:41.220 --> 00:02:46.890
 xbox continuous variation equipped with 

00:02:44.340 --> 00:02:48.319
 Sequential Function with 7-speed between 

00:02:46.890 --> 00:02:50.030
 important 

00:02:48.319 --> 00:02:52.370
 his low shooting skills are 

00:02:50.030 --> 00:02:54.560
 remarkable that the progression wished 

00:02:52.370 --> 00:02:57.519
 without worries even when pulling on 

00:02:54.560 --> 00:02:57.519
 neck a gear 

00:03:04.240 --> 00:03:08.140
 on the road the new nissan is made 

00:03:06.040 --> 00:03:10.240
 appreciate above all for the idea of 

00:03:08.140 --> 00:03:12.220
 consistency I made 

00:03:10.240 --> 00:03:14.380
 the Japanese crossover passes on 

00:03:12.220 --> 00:03:16.450
 disconnected as if nothing had happened and gives 

00:03:14.380 --> 00:03:18.880
 the impression that we can get to 

00:03:16.450 --> 00:03:21.060
 destination always relaxed which one 

00:03:18.880 --> 00:03:22.620
 and the distance to be covered 

00:03:21.060 --> 00:03:24.840
 to give tranquility and even the 

00:03:22.620 --> 00:03:26.640
 behavior in curves where highstyle 

00:03:24.840 --> 00:03:28.260
 he lets himself be guided with little effort 

00:03:26.640 --> 00:03:30.420
 physical and mental 

00:03:28.260 --> 00:03:32.690
 diligently obeying and desiring 

00:03:30.420 --> 00:03:32.690
 of the pilot
