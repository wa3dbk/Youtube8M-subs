saying<00:03:22.769> exciting<00:03:23.639> prospect<00:03:24.209> but<00:03:24.389> that<00:03:24.659> should

00:03:24.860 --> 00:03:24.870 
saying exciting prospect but that should

00:03:24.870 --> 00:03:27.610 
saying exciting prospect but that should
be<00:03:25.019> his<00:03:25.199> original<00:03:25.709> potential<00:03:26.129> 90<00:03:26.699> overall<00:03:27.060> and

00:03:33.409 --> 00:03:33.419 
had his potential boosted by five points

00:03:33.419 --> 00:03:36.740 
had his potential boosted by five points
from<00:03:33.870> 85<00:03:34.500> to<00:03:35.040> 90<00:03:35.549> has<00:03:35.729> the<00:03:35.939> potential<00:03:36.299> to<00:03:36.510> be

00:03:36.740 --> 00:03:36.750 
from 85 to 90 has the potential to be

from 85 to 90 has the potential to be
special<00:03:37.139> and<00:03:37.199> I<00:03:37.379> was<00:03:37.530> actually<00:03:37.949> surprised

00:03:38.390 --> 00:03:38.400 
special and I was actually surprised

00:03:38.400 --> 00:03:39.920 
special and I was actually surprised
when<00:03:38.699> a<00:03:38.729> lot<00:03:38.939> of<00:03:39.060> these<00:03:39.209> players<00:03:39.479> had<00:03:39.780> their

00:03:39.920 --> 00:03:39.930 
when a lot of these players had their

00:03:39.930 --> 00:03:42.379 
when a lot of these players had their
potentials<00:03:40.439> boosted<00:03:40.889> up<00:03:41.040> and<00:03:41.310> I<00:03:41.669> didn't<00:03:42.269> know

00:03:42.379 --> 00:03:42.389 
potentials boosted up and I didn't know

00:03:42.389 --> 00:03:44.569 
potentials boosted up and I didn't know
what<00:03:42.569> was<00:03:42.720> going<00:03:43.079> on<00:03:43.229> Anthony<00:03:43.979> Marshall<00:03:44.189> got

00:03:44.569 --> 00:03:44.579 
what was going on Anthony Marshall got

00:03:44.579 --> 00:03:46.879 
what was going on Anthony Marshall got
his<00:03:44.849> potential<00:03:45.299> boosted<00:03:45.900> up<00:03:45.989> by<00:03:46.139> five<00:03:46.470> by

00:03:46.879 --> 00:03:46.889 
his potential boosted up by five by

00:03:46.889 --> 00:03:49.969 
his potential boosted up by five by
three<00:03:46.919> points<00:03:47.609> from<00:03:47.759> 87<00:03:48.569> to<00:03:48.750> 90<00:03:49.199> and<00:03:49.379> that<00:03:49.409> was

00:03:49.969 --> 00:03:49.979 
three points from 87 to 90 and that was

00:03:49.979 --> 00:03:51.649 
three points from 87 to 90 and that was
has<00:03:50.189> the<00:03:50.370> potential<00:03:50.729> to<00:03:50.909> be<00:03:51.120> special

00:03:51.649 --> 00:03:51.659 
has the potential to be special

00:03:51.659 --> 00:03:54.289 
has the potential to be special
Trevor's<00:03:52.079> also<00:03:52.500> got<00:03:52.709> his<00:03:52.889> potential<00:03:53.310> boost<00:03:54.060> it

00:03:54.289 --> 00:03:54.299 
Trevor's also got his potential boost it

00:03:54.299 --> 00:03:56.689 
Trevor's also got his potential boost it
up<00:03:54.449> to<00:03:54.959> has<00:03:55.169> the<00:03:55.379> potential<00:03:55.709> to<00:03:55.889> be<00:03:56.129> special<00:03:56.549> so

00:03:56.689 --> 00:03:56.699 
up to has the potential to be special so

00:03:56.699 --> 00:03:58.849 
up to has the potential to be special so
you<00:03:56.759> can<00:03:56.909> see<00:03:57.060> a<00:03:57.090> lot<00:03:57.329> of<00:03:57.359> these<00:03:57.599> players<00:03:58.290> got

00:03:58.849 --> 00:03:58.859 
you can see a lot of these players got

00:03:58.859 --> 00:04:00.830 
you can see a lot of these players got
some<00:03:59.159> sort<00:03:59.519> of<00:03:59.609> glitch<00:03:59.849> to<00:04:00.209> their<00:04:00.389> potential

00:04:00.830 --> 00:04:00.840 
some sort of glitch to their potential

00:04:00.840 --> 00:04:04.009 
some sort of glitch to their potential
and<00:04:01.259> and<00:04:02.009> most<00:04:02.549> of<00:04:02.729> everybody<00:04:03.030> got<00:04:03.419> boosted<00:04:03.870> up

00:04:04.009 --> 00:04:04.019 
and and most of everybody got boosted up

00:04:04.019 --> 00:04:06.080 
and and most of everybody got boosted up
but<00:04:04.229> not<00:04:04.439> everybody<00:04:05.009> had<00:04:05.579> a<00:04:05.609> boost<00:04:05.879> and

00:04:06.080 --> 00:04:06.090 
but not everybody had a boost and

00:04:06.090 --> 00:04:08.030 
but not everybody had a boost and
potentials<00:04:06.720> and<00:04:06.900> when<00:04:07.560> I<00:04:07.650> was<00:04:07.799> sending

00:04:08.030 --> 00:04:08.040 
potentials and when I was sending

00:04:08.040 --> 00:04:10.069 
potentials and when I was sending
through<00:04:08.310> seasons<00:04:08.819> I<00:04:09.060> also<00:04:09.299> had<00:04:09.569> to<00:04:09.689> do<00:04:09.840> a<00:04:09.870> lot

00:04:10.069 --> 00:04:10.079 
through seasons I also had to do a lot

00:04:10.079 --> 00:04:11.929 
through seasons I also had to do a lot
of<00:04:10.109> rotations<00:04:10.859> and<00:04:11.099> you<00:04:11.340> can<00:04:11.489> see<00:04:11.609> this<00:04:11.790> guy

00:04:11.929 --> 00:04:11.939 
of rotations and you can see this guy

00:04:11.939 --> 00:04:13.699 
of rotations and you can see this guy
right<00:04:12.150> here<00:04:12.209> karateka<00:04:12.959> had<00:04:13.169> his<00:04:13.319> potential

00:04:13.699 --> 00:04:13.709 
right here karateka had his potential

00:04:13.709 --> 00:04:15.920 
right here karateka had his potential
boosted<00:04:14.280> up<00:04:14.400> to<00:04:14.549> 90<00:04:14.970> which<00:04:15.389> is<00:04:15.540> has<00:04:15.750> the

00:04:15.920 --> 00:04:15.930 
boosted up to 90 which is has the

00:04:15.930 --> 00:04:17.270 
boosted up to 90 which is has the
potential<00:04:16.289> to<00:04:16.590> be<00:04:16.709> special

00:04:17.270 --> 00:04:17.280 
potential to be special

00:04:17.280 --> 00:04:20.089 
potential to be special
valina<00:04:18.269> went<00:04:18.539> to<00:04:18.690> exciting<00:04:19.139> prospect<00:04:19.709> and<00:04:19.919> he

valina went to exciting prospect and he

00:04:20.099 --> 00:04:22.339 
valina went to exciting prospect and he
didn't<00:04:20.400> even<00:04:20.489> play<00:04:20.760> that<00:04:20.969> much<00:04:21.239> he<00:04:22.049> played

00:04:22.339 --> 00:04:22.349 
didn't even play that much he played

00:04:22.349 --> 00:04:23.240 
didn't even play that much he played
don't

00:04:23.240 --> 00:04:23.250 
don't

00:04:23.250 --> 00:04:25.070 
don't
time<00:04:23.640> where<00:04:23.880> he<00:04:24.000> played<00:04:24.270> that<00:04:24.450> much<00:04:24.690> was<00:04:24.930> in

time where he played that much was in

00:04:25.080 --> 00:04:28.280 
time where he played that much was in
the<00:04:25.500> final<00:04:25.920> season<00:04:26.130> in<00:04:26.400> 2020<00:04:27.390> everybody<00:04:27.990> else

00:04:28.280 --> 00:04:28.290 
the final season in 2020 everybody else

00:04:28.290 --> 00:04:30.710 
the final season in 2020 everybody else
was<00:04:28.890> getting<00:04:28.920> rotated<00:04:29.790> a<00:04:29.910> lot<00:04:30.120> and<00:04:30.360> some

00:04:30.710 --> 00:04:30.720 
was getting rotated a lot and some

00:04:30.720 --> 00:04:32.360 
was getting rotated a lot and some
players<00:04:31.080> didn't<00:04:31.380> even<00:04:31.500> play<00:04:31.800> that<00:04:31.980> much<00:04:32.130> and

00:04:32.360 --> 00:04:32.370 
players didn't even play that much and

00:04:32.370 --> 00:04:34.820 
players didn't even play that much and
they<00:04:32.490> did<00:04:32.790> not<00:04:33.000> grow<00:04:33.300> and<00:04:33.570> that's<00:04:34.380> the<00:04:34.530> reason

00:04:34.820 --> 00:04:34.830 
they did not grow and that's the reason

00:04:34.830 --> 00:04:36.320 
they did not grow and that's the reason
why<00:04:34.950> they<00:04:35.130> stated<00:04:35.460> their<00:04:35.670> respective

00:04:36.320 --> 00:04:36.330 
why they stated their respective

00:04:36.330 --> 00:04:39.530 
why they stated their respective
potentials<00:04:37.020> and<00:04:37.260> Benzie<00:04:38.160> also<00:04:38.610> is<00:04:38.760> at<00:04:38.910> 86

00:04:39.530 --> 00:04:39.540 
potentials and Benzie also is at 86

00:04:39.540 --> 00:04:42.740 
potentials and Benzie also is at 86
benches<00:04:40.320> at<00:04:40.440> 86<00:04:40.980> and<00:04:41.220> drew<00:04:41.730> five<00:04:41.940> overall<00:04:42.480> and

00:04:42.740 --> 00:04:42.750 
benches at 86 and drew five overall and

00:04:42.750 --> 00:04:45.140 
benches at 86 and drew five overall and
I<00:04:43.140> was<00:04:43.290> actually<00:04:43.710> surprised<00:04:44.130> at<00:04:44.400> how<00:04:44.700> slow

00:04:45.140 --> 00:04:45.150 
I was actually surprised at how slow

00:04:45.150 --> 00:04:47.240 
I was actually surprised at how slow
these<00:04:45.390> plays<00:04:45.660> were<00:04:45.960> grown<00:04:46.260> until<00:04:46.740> they<00:04:46.890> got<00:04:47.040> a

00:04:47.240 --> 00:04:47.250 
these plays were grown until they got a

00:04:47.250 --> 00:04:50.690 
these plays were grown until they got a
boon<00:04:47.520> to<00:04:47.550> a<00:04:47.820> world<00:04:48.120> level<00:04:48.420> in<00:04:49.160> 2020<00:04:50.160> and<00:04:50.190> I<00:04:50.550> was

00:04:50.690 --> 00:04:50.700 
boon to a world level in 2020 and I was

00:04:50.700 --> 00:04:52.340 
boon to a world level in 2020 and I was
actually<00:04:51.060> surprised<00:04:51.480> that<00:04:51.660> needing<00:04:52.080> a<00:04:52.170> key

00:04:52.340 --> 00:04:52.350 
actually surprised that needing a key

00:04:52.350 --> 00:04:55.040 
actually surprised that needing a key
stated<00:04:52.770> 84<00:04:53.250> volts<00:04:53.460> potential<00:04:54.330> so<00:04:54.480> no<00:04:54.630> complain

00:04:55.040 --> 00:04:55.050 
stated 84 volts potential so no complain

00:04:55.050 --> 00:04:57.920 
stated 84 volts potential so no complain
about<00:04:55.170> that<00:04:55.530> and<00:04:56.150> after<00:04:57.150> this<00:04:57.300> will<00:04:57.630> plague

00:04:57.920 --> 00:04:57.930 
about that and after this will plague

00:05:01.860 --> 00:05:04.010 
team and the team that I was playing
against<00:05:02.310> wasn't<00:05:03.030> a<00:05:03.060> world-class<00:05:03.360> team<00:05:03.780> they

00:05:04.010 --> 00:05:04.020

00:05:04.020 --> 00:05:06.770 
against wasn't a world-class team they
were<00:05:04.110> probably<00:05:04.410> a<00:05:04.650> half<00:05:05.310> star<00:05:05.610> team<00:05:05.880> or<00:05:06.120> even<00:05:06.480> a

were probably a half star team or even a
one<00:05:06.960> star<00:05:07.230> team<00:05:07.500> but<00:05:07.740> should<00:05:08.340> be<00:05:08.370> entertaining

00:05:09.080 --> 00:05:09.090 
one star team but should be entertaining
