principle<00:00:05.970> number<00:00:06.120> ten<00:00:06.510> is<00:00:06.779> tonal<00:00:07.350> centers

00:00:07.790 --> 00:00:07.800 
principle number ten is tonal centers

00:00:07.800 --> 00:00:10.700 
principle number ten is tonal centers
now<00:00:08.220> what<00:00:08.460> is<00:00:08.580> a<00:00:08.610> tonal<00:00:09.150> Center<00:00:09.600> well<00:00:10.200> a<00:00:10.230> tonal

00:00:10.700 --> 00:00:10.710 
now what is a tonal Center well a tonal

00:00:10.710 --> 00:00:13.220 
now what is a tonal Center well a tonal
Center<00:00:11.190> is<00:00:11.370> where<00:00:11.969> your<00:00:12.210> ear<00:00:12.480> hears<00:00:13.020> a

00:00:13.220 --> 00:00:13.230 
Center is where your ear hears a

00:00:13.230 --> 00:00:15.859 
Center is where your ear hears a
resolution<00:00:14.039> point<00:00:14.520> whether<00:00:15.119> that's<00:00:15.420> a<00:00:15.570> chord

00:00:15.859 --> 00:00:15.869 
resolution point whether that's a chord

00:00:15.869 --> 00:00:17.960 
resolution point whether that's a chord
progression<00:00:15.930> or<00:00:16.860> whether<00:00:17.160> that's<00:00:17.340> a<00:00:17.550> melody

00:00:17.960 --> 00:00:17.970 
progression or whether that's a melody

00:00:17.970 --> 00:00:20.359 
progression or whether that's a melody
or<00:00:18.150> a<00:00:18.210> riff<00:00:18.840> or<00:00:19.110> a<00:00:19.140> lick<00:00:19.380> okay

00:00:20.359 --> 00:00:20.369 
or a riff or a lick okay

00:00:20.369 --> 00:00:23.240 
or a riff or a lick okay
now<00:00:20.940> of<00:00:21.480> course<00:00:21.570> we've<00:00:22.020> built<00:00:22.350> our<00:00:22.560> chords<00:00:23.010> now

00:00:23.240 --> 00:00:23.250 
now of course we've built our chords now

00:00:23.250 --> 00:00:25.820 
now of course we've built our chords now
so<00:00:23.760> we<00:00:23.880> can<00:00:24.060> build<00:00:24.300> chord<00:00:24.780> progressions<00:00:25.470> and<00:00:25.590> a

00:00:25.820 --> 00:00:25.830 
so we can build chord progressions and a

00:00:25.830 --> 00:00:28.520 
so we can build chord progressions and a
progression<00:00:26.250> is<00:00:26.670> a<00:00:26.940> string<00:00:27.510> of<00:00:27.660> chords<00:00:28.110> that

00:00:28.520 --> 00:00:28.530 
progression is a string of chords that

00:00:28.530 --> 00:00:30.290 
progression is a string of chords that
are<00:00:28.560> put<00:00:28.800> together<00:00:28.950> to<00:00:29.340> create<00:00:29.580> a<00:00:29.700> harmonic

00:00:30.290 --> 00:00:30.300 
are put together to create a harmonic

00:00:30.300 --> 00:00:34.010 
are put together to create a harmonic
progression<00:00:30.780> if<00:00:30.900> you<00:00:30.990> like<00:00:31.200> or<00:00:31.470> a<00:00:31.800> groove<00:00:33.020> so

00:00:34.010 --> 00:00:34.020 
progression if you like or a groove so

00:00:34.020 --> 00:00:36.110 
progression if you like or a groove so
what<00:00:34.200> we<00:00:34.320> do<00:00:34.530> is<00:00:34.710> we<00:00:34.980> can<00:00:35.160> build<00:00:35.489> these<00:00:35.730> chord

00:00:36.110 --> 00:00:36.120 
what we do is we can build these chord

00:00:36.120 --> 00:00:37.880 
what we do is we can build these chord
progressions<00:00:36.719> using<00:00:37.199> the<00:00:37.289> chords<00:00:37.620> that<00:00:37.769> we've

00:00:37.880 --> 00:00:37.890 
progressions using the chords that we've

00:00:37.890 --> 00:00:39.560 
progressions using the chords that we've
built<00:00:38.070> from<00:00:38.309> the<00:00:38.399> G<00:00:38.579> major<00:00:38.820> scale<00:00:39.179> or<00:00:39.359> any

00:00:39.560 --> 00:00:39.570 
built from the G major scale or any

00:00:39.570 --> 00:00:41.779 
built from the G major scale or any
other<00:00:39.780> key<00:00:40.050> for<00:00:40.320> that<00:00:40.350> matter<00:00:40.679> alright<00:00:41.640> and

00:00:41.779 --> 00:00:41.789 
other key for that matter alright and

00:00:41.789 --> 00:00:44.000 
other key for that matter alright and
that's<00:00:41.940> going<00:00:42.149> to<00:00:42.210> give<00:00:42.390> us<00:00:42.649> you<00:00:43.649> know<00:00:43.679> at<00:00:43.890> the

00:00:44.000 --> 00:00:44.010 
that's going to give us you know at the

00:00:44.010 --> 00:00:47.090 
that's going to give us you know at the
basis<00:00:44.429> for<00:00:44.670> our<00:00:44.730> songs<00:00:45.149> and<00:00:45.620> any<00:00:46.620> music<00:00:47.069> that

00:00:47.090 --> 00:00:47.100 
basis for our songs and any music that

00:00:47.100 --> 00:00:50.059 
basis for our songs and any music that
we<00:00:47.309> put<00:00:47.519> together<00:00:47.640> now<00:00:48.569> we<00:00:49.229> can<00:00:49.440> resolve<00:00:49.769> to

00:00:50.059 --> 00:00:50.069 
we put together now we can resolve to

00:00:50.069 --> 00:00:52.099 
we put together now we can resolve to
the<00:00:50.100> first<00:00:50.429> chord<00:00:50.789> in<00:00:50.940> that<00:00:51.120> key<00:00:51.420> if<00:00:51.690> we<00:00:51.929> want

00:00:52.099 --> 00:00:52.109 
the first chord in that key if we want

00:00:52.109 --> 00:00:54.799 
the first chord in that key if we want
to<00:00:52.319> we<00:00:52.440> can<00:00:52.530> play<00:00:52.769> G<00:00:53.159> DC<00:00:53.819> for<00:00:54.089> example<00:00:54.600> and

00:00:54.799 --> 00:00:54.809 
to we can play G DC for example and

00:00:54.809 --> 00:00:57.709 
to we can play G DC for example and
resolve<00:00:55.379> back<00:00:55.679> to<00:00:55.889> the<00:00:56.010> G<00:00:56.219> but<00:00:57.030> not<00:00:57.269> all<00:00:57.479> of<00:00:57.629> our

00:00:57.709 --> 00:00:57.719 
resolve back to the G but not all of our

00:00:57.719 --> 00:00:59.809 
resolve back to the G but not all of our
progressions<00:00:57.929> are<00:00:58.559> always<00:00:59.159> going<00:00:59.339> to<00:00:59.460> do<00:00:59.609> that

00:00:59.809 --> 00:00:59.819 
progressions are always going to do that

00:00:59.819 --> 00:01:02.719 
progressions are always going to do that
because<00:01:00.300> we<00:01:00.449> have<00:01:00.659> seven<00:01:01.079> chords<00:01:01.589> and<00:01:01.800> seven

00:01:02.719 --> 00:01:02.729 
because we have seven chords and seven

00:01:02.729 --> 00:01:04.850 
because we have seven chords and seven
positions<00:01:03.269> within<00:01:03.629> our<00:01:03.809> scale<00:01:04.140> we<00:01:04.409> can

00:01:04.850 --> 00:01:04.860 
positions within our scale we can

00:01:04.860 --> 00:01:08.000 
positions within our scale we can
actually<00:01:05.010> resolve<00:01:05.970> a<00:01:06.270> chord<00:01:06.780> progressions<00:01:07.380> to

00:01:08.000 --> 00:01:08.010 
actually resolve a chord progressions to

00:01:08.010 --> 00:01:10.370 
actually resolve a chord progressions to
any<00:01:08.130> point<00:01:08.490> within<00:01:08.850> the<00:01:09.120> scale<00:01:09.390> so<00:01:09.960> any<00:01:10.230> of

00:01:10.370 --> 00:01:10.380 
any point within the scale so any of

00:01:10.380 --> 00:01:12.950 
any point within the scale so any of
those<00:01:10.530> seven<00:01:10.890> places<00:01:11.070> now<00:01:11.940> those<00:01:12.570> positions

00:01:12.950 --> 00:01:12.960 
those seven places now those positions

00:01:12.960 --> 00:01:17.150 
those seven places now those positions
are<00:01:13.860> often<00:01:14.130> referred<00:01:14.670> to<00:01:14.700> as<00:01:15.240> modes<00:01:16.080> or<00:01:16.500> modal

00:01:17.150 --> 00:01:17.160 
are often referred to as modes or modal

00:01:17.160 --> 00:01:19.250 
are often referred to as modes or modal
progressions<00:01:17.730> and<00:01:18.000> all<00:01:18.300> that<00:01:18.450> means<00:01:18.750> is<00:01:19.050> that

00:01:19.250 --> 00:01:19.260 
progressions and all that means is that

00:01:19.260 --> 00:01:21.260 
progressions and all that means is that
you're<00:01:19.590> resolving<00:01:20.130> to<00:01:20.460> somewhere<00:01:20.850> other<00:01:21.150> than

00:01:21.260 --> 00:01:21.270 
you're resolving to somewhere other than

00:01:21.270 --> 00:01:23.960 
you're resolving to somewhere other than
the<00:01:21.780> first<00:01:22.080> note<00:01:22.410> or<00:01:22.650> first<00:01:22.920> chord<00:01:23.310> of<00:01:23.550> the<00:01:23.640> key

00:01:23.960 --> 00:01:23.970 
the first note or first chord of the key

00:01:23.970 --> 00:01:26.120 
the first note or first chord of the key
now<00:01:24.690> I'm<00:01:25.260> going<00:01:25.410> to<00:01:25.470> give<00:01:25.590> you<00:01:25.680> a<00:01:25.770> couple<00:01:26.100> of

which means my chord progression that

00:01:48.420 --> 00:01:50.390 
which means my chord progression that
I'm<00:01:48.570> creating<00:01:48.870> is<00:01:49.500> going<00:01:49.950> to<00:01:50.040> be<00:01:50.130> played

I'm creating is going to be played

00:01:50.400 --> 00:01:52.420 
I'm creating is going to be played
through<00:01:50.640> using<00:01:51.030> chords<00:01:51.390> from<00:01:51.600> the<00:01:51.690> key<00:01:51.840> of<00:01:51.900> G

00:01:52.420 --> 00:01:52.430 
through using chords from the key of G

00:01:52.430 --> 00:01:55.970 
through using chords from the key of G
resolving<00:01:53.430> to<00:01:54.270> the<00:01:54.390> chord<00:01:54.690> of<00:01:54.870> G<00:01:54.900> alright<00:01:55.740> so

00:01:55.970 --> 00:01:55.980 
resolving to the chord of G alright so

00:01:55.980 --> 00:01:58.220 
resolving to the chord of G alright so
let's<00:01:56.160> pull<00:01:56.310> up<00:01:56.430> that<00:01:56.550> first<00:01:56.790> track<00:01:57.150> I'll<00:01:57.750> play

00:01:58.220 --> 00:01:58.230 
let's pull up that first track I'll play

00:01:58.230 --> 00:01:59.690 
let's pull up that first track I'll play
it<00:01:58.380> a<00:01:58.440> little<00:01:58.650> bit<00:01:58.860> and<00:01:59.220> then<00:01:59.370> I'm<00:01:59.520> going<00:01:59.640> to

00:01:59.690 --> 00:01:59.700 
it a little bit and then I'm going to

00:01:59.700 --> 00:02:01.070 
it a little bit and then I'm going to
break<00:01:59.910> that<00:02:00.060> down<00:02:00.120> for<00:02:00.570> you<00:02:00.659> so<00:02:00.720> you<00:02:00.870> have<00:02:01.020> a

00:02:01.070 --> 00:02:01.080 
break that down for you so you have a

00:02:01.080 --> 00:02:33.790 
break that down for you so you have a
full<00:02:01.320> understanding<00:02:01.610> here<00:02:02.610> we<00:02:02.700> go

00:02:33.790 --> 00:02:33.800 

00:02:33.800 --> 00:02:36.950 

our<00:02:34.800> first<00:02:35.430> chord<00:02:35.940> progression<00:02:36.450> here<00:02:36.750> with

00:02:36.950 --> 00:02:36.960 
our first chord progression here with

00:02:36.960 --> 00:02:39.800 
our first chord progression here with
the<00:02:37.110> tonal<00:02:37.500> center<00:02:37.920> of<00:02:38.040> the<00:02:38.160> one<00:02:38.340> chord<00:02:38.700> G<00:02:39.150> is

00:02:39.800 --> 00:02:39.810 
the tonal center of the one chord G is

00:02:39.810 --> 00:02:43.100 
the tonal center of the one chord G is
called<00:02:40.200> Ionian<00:02:40.950> alright<00:02:41.490> so<00:02:41.850> our<00:02:42.090> modes<00:02:42.750> and

00:02:43.100 --> 00:02:43.110 
called Ionian alright so our modes and

00:02:43.110 --> 00:02:45.470 
called Ionian alright so our modes and
our<00:02:43.260> tonal<00:02:43.620> centers<00:02:44.040> are<00:02:44.370> one<00:02:45.180> and<00:02:45.330> the<00:02:45.390> same

00:02:45.470 --> 00:02:45.480 
our tonal centers are one and the same

00:02:45.480 --> 00:02:48.140 
our tonal centers are one and the same
thing<00:02:46.080> now<00:02:46.620> let's<00:02:46.800> qualify<00:02:47.340> why<00:02:47.670> that

00:02:48.140 --> 00:02:48.150 
thing now let's qualify why that

00:02:48.150 --> 00:02:50.240 
thing now let's qualify why that
resolves<00:02:48.690> back<00:02:48.960> to<00:02:49.140> that<00:02:49.320> first<00:02:49.590> chord<00:02:50.010> in<00:02:50.160> the

00:02:50.240 --> 00:02:50.250 
resolves back to that first chord in the

00:02:50.250 --> 00:02:52.280 
resolves back to that first chord in the
key<00:02:50.280> of<00:02:50.490> G<00:02:50.850> let's<00:02:51.570> look<00:02:51.780> at<00:02:51.870> the<00:02:51.960> progression

00:02:52.280 --> 00:02:52.290 
key of G let's look at the progression

00:02:52.290 --> 00:02:55.520 
key of G let's look at the progression
on<00:02:52.620> the<00:02:52.920> fretboard<00:02:53.420> so<00:02:54.420> here<00:02:54.600> we<00:02:54.690> have<00:02:54.840> a<00:02:54.870> g5

00:02:55.520 --> 00:02:55.530 
on the fretboard so here we have a g5

00:02:55.530 --> 00:02:57.890 
on the fretboard so here we have a g5
chord<00:02:55.890> as<00:02:56.700> we<00:02:57.000> know<00:02:57.150> we've<00:02:57.360> got<00:02:57.540> our<00:02:57.570> power

00:02:57.890 --> 00:02:57.900 
chord as we know we've got our power

00:02:57.900 --> 00:02:59.600 
chord as we know we've got our power
chords<00:02:58.320> as<00:02:58.410> well<00:02:58.620> as<00:02:58.740> their<00:02:58.890> triads<00:02:59.310> and<00:02:59.490> their

00:02:59.600 --> 00:02:59.610 
chords as well as their triads and their

00:02:59.610 --> 00:03:03.860 
chords as well as their triads and their
7th<00:03:00.000> so<00:03:00.800> G<00:03:01.800> then<00:03:02.700> I<00:03:02.820> played<00:03:03.060> a<00:03:03.090> G<00:03:03.480> with<00:03:03.660> the<00:03:03.720> B

00:03:03.860 --> 00:03:03.870 
7th so G then I played a G with the B

00:03:03.870 --> 00:03:05.540 
7th so G then I played a G with the B
BAE<00:03:04.080> so<00:03:04.140> we've<00:03:04.500> got<00:03:04.620> a<00:03:04.650> nice<00:03:04.860> slash<00:03:05.190> chord

00:03:05.540 --> 00:03:05.550 
BAE so we've got a nice slash chord

00:03:05.550 --> 00:03:07.449 
BAE so we've got a nice slash chord
thing<00:03:05.820> there

00:03:07.449 --> 00:03:07.459 
thing there

00:03:07.459 --> 00:03:12.000 
thing there
then<00:03:07.969> we<00:03:08.180> have<00:03:08.329> a<00:03:08.359> C<00:03:08.750> and<00:03:09.400> this<00:03:10.400> is<00:03:10.579> C<00:03:10.790> 5<00:03:11.120> 2<00:03:11.480> chord

00:03:12.000 --> 00:03:12.010 
then we have a C and this is C 5 2 chord

00:03:12.010 --> 00:03:17.300 
then we have a C and this is C 5 2 chord
to<00:03:13.010> a<00:03:13.040> D<00:03:13.340> with<00:03:13.640> an<00:03:13.760> f-sharp<00:03:14.239> bass

00:03:17.300 --> 00:03:17.310 

00:03:17.310 --> 00:03:20.940 

now<00:03:18.420> using<00:03:19.420> your<00:03:19.450> ear<00:03:19.810> can<00:03:20.140> you<00:03:20.260> determine

00:03:20.940 --> 00:03:20.950 
now using your ear can you determine

00:03:20.950 --> 00:03:33.679 
now using your ear can you determine
where<00:03:21.819> that<00:03:21.849> resolves<00:03:22.660> to<00:03:22.870> well<00:03:23.200> to<00:03:23.470> me

00:03:33.679 --> 00:03:33.689 

00:03:33.689 --> 00:03:36.569 

resolves<00:03:34.689> nicely<00:03:35.260> back<00:03:35.530> to<00:03:35.680> our<00:03:35.829> first<00:03:36.159> chord

00:03:36.569 --> 00:03:36.579 
resolves nicely back to our first chord

00:03:36.579 --> 00:03:39.240 
resolves nicely back to our first chord
so<00:03:37.299> the<00:03:37.450> tonal<00:03:37.870> center<00:03:38.319> because<00:03:38.650> it<00:03:38.769> resolves

00:03:39.240 --> 00:03:39.250 
so the tonal center because it resolves

00:03:39.250 --> 00:03:42.179 
so the tonal center because it resolves
to<00:03:39.430> the<00:03:39.519> first<00:03:39.760> chord<00:03:40.150> in<00:03:40.360> the<00:03:40.720> key<00:03:40.750> is<00:03:41.739> going

00:03:42.179 --> 00:03:42.189 
to the first chord in the key is going

00:03:42.189 --> 00:03:45.960 
to the first chord in the key is going
to<00:03:42.310> be<00:03:42.430> a<00:03:42.760> G<00:03:43.180> Ionian<00:03:43.900> alright<00:03:44.650> now<00:03:44.980> that's<00:03:45.670> a

00:03:45.960 --> 00:03:45.970 
to be a G Ionian alright now that's a

00:03:45.970 --> 00:03:47.220 
to be a G Ionian alright now that's a
tonal<00:03:46.659> Center

00:03:47.220 --> 00:03:47.230 
tonal Center

00:03:47.230 --> 00:03:49.289 
tonal Center
alright<00:03:47.530> so<00:03:47.739> that<00:03:47.890> qualifies<00:03:48.459> what<00:03:48.849> a<00:03:48.879> tonal

00:03:49.289 --> 00:03:49.299 
alright so that qualifies what a tonal

00:03:49.299 --> 00:03:51.539 
alright so that qualifies what a tonal
Center<00:03:49.659> is<00:03:49.750> it's<00:03:49.930> where<00:03:50.110> your<00:03:50.260> ear<00:03:50.530> hears<00:03:51.010> the

00:03:51.539 --> 00:03:51.549 
Center is it's where your ear hears the

00:03:51.549 --> 00:03:54.240 
Center is it's where your ear hears the
resolution<00:03:52.120> of<00:03:52.269> the<00:03:52.390> chord<00:03:52.599> progression<00:03:53.140> or<00:03:53.530> a

00:03:54.240 --> 00:03:54.250 
resolution of the chord progression or a

resolution of the chord progression or a
melody<00:03:54.790> or<00:03:54.970> a<00:03:55.030> riff<00:03:55.659> or<00:03:55.870> a<00:03:55.900> lick<00:03:56.200> okay<00:03:56.859> now

00:03:57.410 --> 00:03:57.420 
melody or a riff or a lick okay now

00:04:04.349 --> 00:04:04.359 
to give you a tonal center that resolves

00:04:04.359 --> 00:04:06.420 
to give you a tonal center that resolves
to<00:04:04.420> the<00:04:04.659> second<00:04:05.109> chord<00:04:05.349> in<00:04:05.530> err<00:04:05.650> key<00:04:05.920> which<00:04:06.190> by

chord progression so you can hear how

00:04:12.459 --> 00:04:15.089 
chord progression so you can hear how
that<00:04:13.150> sounds<00:04:13.470> and<00:04:14.470> why<00:04:14.650> you<00:04:14.709> would<00:04:14.920> determine

00:04:15.089 --> 00:04:15.099 
that sounds and why you would determine

00:04:15.099 --> 00:04:18.390

00:04:18.390 --> 00:04:18.400 
that that was a second tonal Center or a

00:04:18.400 --> 00:04:20.039 
that that was a second tonal Center or a
different<00:04:18.699> tonal<00:04:19.030> Center<00:04:19.389> other<00:04:19.630> than<00:04:19.900> the

00:04:20.039 --> 00:04:20.049 
different tonal Center other than the

00:04:20.049 --> 00:04:21.930 
different tonal Center other than the
one<00:04:20.199> all<00:04:20.620> right<00:04:20.859> so<00:04:21.400> let's<00:04:21.549> pull<00:04:21.699> out<00:04:21.789> that

00:04:21.930 --> 00:04:21.940 
one all right so let's pull out that

00:06:38.250 --> 00:06:38.260 
chords that we were using to create that

00:06:38.260 --> 00:06:39.870 
chords that we were using to create that
chord<00:06:38.530> progression<00:06:38.590> play<00:06:39.520> the<00:06:39.669> chord

00:06:39.870 --> 00:06:39.880 
chord progression play the chord

00:06:39.880 --> 00:06:43.010 
chord progression play the chord
progression<00:06:40.350> resolved<00:06:41.350> nicely<00:06:42.010> and<00:06:42.280> squarely

00:06:43.010 --> 00:06:43.020 
progression resolved nicely and squarely

00:06:43.020 --> 00:06:46.080

back<00:06:44.020> to<00:06:44.229> the<00:06:44.350> second<00:06:44.860> chord<00:06:45.160> so<00:06:45.760> it<00:06:45.850> wasn't

00:06:46.080 --> 00:06:46.090 
back to the second chord so it wasn't

00:06:46.090 --> 00:06:48.090 
back to the second chord so it wasn't
the<00:06:46.150> first<00:06:46.330> chord<00:06:46.720> at<00:06:46.840> all<00:06:46.990> albeit<00:06:47.860> that<00:06:47.979> we

00:06:48.090 --> 00:06:48.100 
the first chord at all albeit that we

00:06:48.100 --> 00:06:50.279 
the first chord at all albeit that we
derived<00:06:48.490> all<00:06:48.699> of<00:06:48.850> our<00:06:48.970> chords<00:06:49.389> from<00:06:49.539> that<00:06:49.840> G

00:06:50.279 --> 00:06:50.289 
derived all of our chords from that G

00:06:50.289 --> 00:06:52.890 
derived all of our chords from that G
major<00:06:50.530> scale<00:06:50.949> we<00:06:51.729> resolved<00:06:52.240> to<00:06:52.330> a<00:06:52.449> different

00:06:52.890 --> 00:06:52.900 
major scale we resolved to a different

00:06:52.900 --> 00:06:54.570 
major scale we resolved to a different
point<00:06:53.139> within<00:06:53.470> the<00:06:53.770> G<00:06:53.949> Major<00:06:54.190> scale

00:06:54.570 --> 00:06:54.580 
point within the G Major scale

00:06:54.580 --> 00:06:57.360 
point within the G Major scale
that's<00:06:55.270> what<00:06:55.539> tonality<00:06:56.050> is<00:06:56.560> and<00:06:56.860> that's<00:06:57.220> what

00:06:57.360 --> 00:06:57.370 
that's what tonality is and that's what

00:06:57.370 --> 00:06:59.310 
that's what tonality is and that's what
the<00:06:57.490> tonal<00:06:57.880> Center<00:06:58.240> is<00:06:58.360> so<00:06:58.810> hopefully<00:06:59.139> that's

00:06:59.310 --> 00:06:59.320 
the tonal Center is so hopefully that's

00:06:59.320 --> 00:07:01.860 
the tonal Center is so hopefully that's
clarified<00:06:59.770> that<00:07:00.160> for<00:07:00.460> you<00:07:00.580> there<00:07:01.300> are<00:07:01.449> five

00:07:01.860 --> 00:07:01.870 
clarified that for you there are five

00:07:01.870 --> 00:07:03.719 
clarified that for you there are five
more<00:07:02.110> tracks<00:07:02.470> obviously<00:07:03.009> there<00:07:03.190> are<00:07:03.310> seven

00:07:03.719 --> 00:07:03.729 
more tracks obviously there are seven

00:07:03.729 --> 00:07:06.020 
more tracks obviously there are seven
tonal<00:07:04.150> centers<00:07:04.570> within<00:07:04.810> a<00:07:05.139> seven<00:07:05.620> note<00:07:05.830> scale

00:07:06.020 --> 00:07:06.030 
tonal centers within a seven note scale

00:07:06.030 --> 00:07:09.270 
tonal centers within a seven note scale
obviously<00:07:07.030> it<00:07:07.090> Rizzo<00:07:07.500> resolves<00:07:08.500> to<00:07:08.650> each<00:07:09.130> of

00:07:09.270 --> 00:07:09.280 
obviously it Rizzo resolves to each of

00:07:09.280 --> 00:07:11.939 
obviously it Rizzo resolves to each of
any<00:07:09.460> of<00:07:09.639> those<00:07:09.820> chords<00:07:10.360> okay<00:07:10.960> so<00:07:11.530> take<00:07:11.710> a<00:07:11.740> look
