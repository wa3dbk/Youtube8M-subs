00:04:08.370 --> 00:04:13.590
 let's work, let's give it double 

00:04:11.160 --> 00:04:16.260

00:04:13.590 --> 00:04:20.859
 that is the gun the sounds of the 

00:04:16.260 --> 00:04:22.960
 we won here we are going to give him 

00:04:20.859 --> 00:04:24.340
 I already felt like this because I already 

00:04:22.960 --> 00:04:26.740
 I have 

00:04:24.340 --> 00:04:29.740
 ok and well the world cup we have it 

00:04:26.740 --> 00:04:33.460
 installed then the favorite mind and I what 

00:04:29.740 --> 00:04:36.699
 I'm going to open and see you in the minecraft 

00:04:33.460 --> 00:04:38.889
 guys is not locked up we already have 

00:04:36.699 --> 00:04:41.270
 installed all three and so avoid open 

00:04:38.889 --> 00:04:43.250
 the main coffee and I show you what 

00:04:41.270 --> 00:04:47.390
 much that we are already here back in 

00:04:43.250 --> 00:04:48.650
 micro legit with our model we go to a 

00:04:47.390 --> 00:04:51.620
 little about birds is the demonstration 

00:04:48.650 --> 00:04:55.289
 if you have if you see a little the guide do 

00:04:51.620 --> 00:04:57.860
 sorry in the truth but good 

00:04:55.289 --> 00:05:02.460
 what he added to us is simply this 

00:04:57.860 --> 00:05:05.030
 Eggs to study the singer on 

00:05:02.460 --> 00:05:09.150
 payment a game and win 

00:05:05.030 --> 00:05:12.150
 as we can see here is if we hit 

00:05:09.150 --> 00:05:14.460
 a little bit so we can listen well if 

00:05:12.150 --> 00:05:19.870
 we give a blow today he's going to tell us what 

00:05:14.460 --> 00:05:24.420
 saying the famous phrase guanghan star 

00:05:19.870 --> 00:05:24.420
 and a little weird 

00:05:25.720 --> 00:05:31.600
 well, it is assumed that the model that 

00:05:28.180 --> 00:05:35.810
 you add this only the character of the 

00:05:31.600 --> 00:05:40.300
 singer of hang style or punk when walking 

00:05:35.810 --> 00:05:40.300
 it's a little crazy the character itself 

00:05:41.900 --> 00:05:48.800
 but when you killed him with experiences 

00:05:45.110 --> 00:05:51.230
 itself the most the only thing that adds 

00:05:48.800 --> 00:05:53.630
 as a parliamentarian 

00:05:51.230 --> 00:05:57.070
 does not have much to add not 

00:05:53.630 --> 00:05:57.070
 they add movements or nothing 

00:05:58.630 --> 00:06:04.340
 in this way if you do not add anything to us 

00:06:02.030 --> 00:06:07.780
 no other payments 

00:06:04.340 --> 00:06:07.780
 and nothing else like that 

00:06:08.080 --> 00:06:14.379
 and then what is good, guys 

00:06:11.740 --> 00:06:16.060
 we have returned had an unforeseen my 

00:06:14.379 --> 00:06:20.159
 parents came to troll like this 

00:06:16.060 --> 00:06:23.650
 say it improbable being this the rest 

00:06:20.159 --> 00:06:26.550
 does not do not add much else the singer 

00:06:23.650 --> 00:06:26.550
 it's good 

00:06:28.590 --> 00:06:33.310

00:06:31.449 --> 00:06:36.159
