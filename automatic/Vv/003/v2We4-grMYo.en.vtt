anyway let's take a look inside
obviously<00:00:21.780> there's<00:00:22.110> the<00:00:22.170> Blockheads

00:00:23.080 --> 00:00:23.090 
obviously there's the Blockheads

00:00:23.090 --> 00:00:25.880

pack<00:00:26.070> there<00:00:26.340> you<00:00:26.430> go<00:00:26.900> all<00:00:27.900> right<00:00:28.080> I<00:00:28.290> end<00:00:29.190> on

00:00:29.360 --> 00:00:29.370 
pack there you go all right I end on

00:00:29.370 --> 00:00:32.299 
pack there you go all right I end on
would<00:00:29.670> go<00:00:29.910> first<00:00:30.420> of<00:00:30.570> all<00:00:30.740> they<00:00:31.740> endure<00:00:32.129> it

00:00:32.299 --> 00:00:32.309 
would go first of all they endure it

00:00:32.309 --> 00:00:33.979 
would go first of all they endure it
looks<00:00:32.550> pretty<00:00:32.879> much<00:00:33.059> like<00:00:33.210> the<00:00:33.510> standard<00:00:33.899> I

00:00:33.979 --> 00:00:33.989 
looks pretty much like the standard I

00:00:33.989 --> 00:00:36.290 
looks pretty much like the standard I
endure<00:00:34.320> and<00:00:34.680> Jordan<00:00:35.460> does<00:00:35.700> just<00:00:36.090> like<00:00:36.180> a

00:00:36.290 --> 00:00:36.300 
endure and Jordan does just like a

00:00:36.300 --> 00:00:38.239 
endure and Jordan does just like a
slightly<00:00:36.719> more<00:00:36.989> cartoony<00:00:37.589> version<00:00:37.949> of<00:00:38.070> what

00:00:38.239 --> 00:00:38.249 
slightly more cartoony version of what

00:00:38.249 --> 00:00:40.610 
slightly more cartoony version of what
you've<00:00:38.399> already<00:00:38.579> got<00:00:38.879> and<00:00:39.120> I'd<00:00:40.109> say<00:00:40.379> the

00:00:40.610 --> 00:00:40.620 
you've already got and I'd say the

00:00:40.620 --> 00:00:42.040 
you've already got and I'd say the
textures<00:00:41.100> would<00:00:41.219> probably<00:00:41.519> slightly<00:00:41.730> about

00:00:42.040 --> 00:00:42.050 
textures would probably slightly about

00:00:42.050 --> 00:00:45.020 
textures would probably slightly about
right<00:00:43.050> and<00:00:43.199> head<00:00:43.710> inside<00:00:44.070> now<00:00:44.339> this<00:00:44.850> is<00:00:44.999> a

00:00:45.020 --> 00:00:45.030 
right and head inside now this is a

00:00:45.030 --> 00:00:46.790 
right and head inside now this is a
cobblestone<00:00:45.420> steps<00:00:45.809> I<00:00:45.960> like<00:00:46.170> the<00:00:46.409> cop<00:00:46.620> I

and<00:04:42.720> sandstone<00:04:43.470> the<00:04:43.890> Sunstone<00:04:44.430> I<00:04:44.550> think<00:04:44.730> it'd

00:04:45.110 --> 00:04:45.120 
and sandstone the Sunstone I think it'd

00:04:45.120 --> 00:04:46.820 
and sandstone the Sunstone I think it'd
be<00:04:45.150> better<00:04:45.450> if<00:04:45.660> it<00:04:45.780> was<00:04:45.840> a<00:04:45.900> like<00:04:46.170> more<00:04:46.560> yellow

00:04:46.820 --> 00:04:46.830 
be better if it was a like more yellow

00:04:46.830 --> 00:04:49.010 
be better if it was a like more yellow
the<00:04:47.370> same<00:04:47.610> with<00:04:47.760> the<00:04:47.850> sand<00:04:48.330> because<00:04:48.840> obviously

00:04:49.010 --> 00:04:49.020 
the same with the sand because obviously

00:04:49.020 --> 00:04:50.960 
the same with the sand because obviously
it's<00:04:49.320> mom<00:04:49.500> it's<00:04:49.830> Kath<00:04:50.070> only<00:04:50.430> and<00:04:50.640> it<00:04:50.700> looked

it's mom it's Kath only and it looked

00:04:50.970 --> 00:04:53.330 
it's mom it's Kath only and it looked
nice<00:04:51.270> if<00:04:51.600> it<00:04:51.690> was<00:04:51.780> a<00:04:51.840> brighter<00:04:52.140> color<00:04:52.340> because

00:04:53.330 --> 00:04:53.340 
nice if it was a brighter color because

00:04:53.340 --> 00:04:55.160 
nice if it was a brighter color because

them<00:06:30.120> down<00:06:30.150> wall<00:06:31.140> looks<00:06:31.410> cool<00:06:31.710> it<00:06:31.950> looks<00:06:32.070> like

00:06:32.659 --> 00:06:32.669 
them down wall looks cool it looks like

00:06:32.669 --> 00:06:35.719 
them down wall looks cool it looks like
the<00:06:32.880> same<00:06:33.120> as<00:06:33.479> the<00:06:34.440> diamond<00:06:34.830> door<00:06:34.979> but<00:06:35.340> it's

00:06:35.719 --> 00:06:35.729 
the same as the diamond door but it's

00:06:35.729 --> 00:06:38.959 
the same as the diamond door but it's
just<00:06:36.030> without<00:06:36.780> it<00:06:36.890> there's<00:06:37.890> a<00:06:38.130> glass

00:06:38.959 --> 00:06:38.969 
just without it there's a glass

00:06:38.969 --> 00:06:45.199 
just without it there's a glass
and<00:06:39.360> we'll<00:06:39.779> take<00:06:39.959> a<00:06:40.019> look<00:06:40.169> inside<00:06:41.389> and<00:06:43.339> yeah<00:06:44.339> so

00:06:45.199 --> 00:06:45.209 
and we'll take a look inside and yeah so

00:06:45.209 --> 00:06:47.779 
and we'll take a look inside and yeah so
this<00:06:45.329> is<00:06:45.509> a<00:06:45.539> cool<00:06:45.809> texture<00:06:46.079> fact<00:06:46.319> I<00:06:46.439> think<00:06:46.789> I'll

00:06:47.779 --> 00:06:47.789 
this is a cool texture fact I think I'll

00:06:47.789 --> 00:06:49.159 
this is a cool texture fact I think I'll
put<00:06:48.029> the<00:06:48.119> download<00:06:48.449> link<00:06:48.629> in<00:06:48.779> the<00:06:48.869> bottom<00:06:48.989> if

00:06:49.159 --> 00:06:49.169 
put the download link in the bottom if

00:06:49.169 --> 00:06:51.859 
put the download link in the bottom if
you<00:06:49.199> wanna<00:06:49.409> try<00:06:49.559> it<00:06:49.589> out<00:06:49.739> yourself<00:06:50.149> very<00:06:51.149> very

00:06:51.859 --> 00:06:51.869 
you wanna try it out yourself very very

00:06:51.869 --> 00:06:54.739 
you wanna try it out yourself very very
very<00:06:52.169> very<00:06:52.349> cool<00:06:52.889> as<00:06:53.819> you<00:06:54.089> can<00:06:54.269> see<00:06:54.479> with<00:06:54.659> the

00:06:54.739 --> 00:06:54.749 
very very cool as you can see with the

00:06:54.749 --> 00:06:57.889 
very very cool as you can see with the
why<00:06:54.929> it<00:06:55.649> looks<00:06:55.829> better<00:06:56.269> when<00:06:57.269> it's<00:06:57.479> more<00:06:57.719> than

00:06:57.889 --> 00:06:57.899 
why it looks better when it's more than

00:06:57.899 --> 00:07:04.189 
why it looks better when it's more than
one<00:06:58.110> block<00:06:59.089> yeah<00:07:01.489> anywhere<00:07:03.079> although<00:07:04.079> the

00:07:04.189 --> 00:07:04.199 
one block yeah anywhere although the

00:07:04.199 --> 00:07:06.229
