turn<00:00:20.250> who<00:00:20.550> I'm<00:00:20.760> a<00:00:20.789> huge<00:00:21.119> fan<00:00:21.180> of<00:00:21.449> has<00:00:22.109> actually

00:00:22.490 --> 00:00:22.500 
turn who I'm a huge fan of has actually

00:00:22.500 --> 00:00:24.349 
turn who I'm a huge fan of has actually
been<00:00:22.590> slumping<00:00:22.920> for<00:00:23.070> quite<00:00:23.400> some<00:00:23.609> has<00:00:23.939> started

00:00:24.349 --> 00:00:24.359 
been slumping for quite some has started

00:00:24.359 --> 00:00:27.140 
been slumping for quite some has started
slumping<00:00:24.750> again<00:00:25.019> he<00:00:25.529> has<00:00:26.160> lost<00:00:26.400> his<00:00:26.640> last<00:00:26.789> four

00:00:27.140 --> 00:00:27.150 
slumping again he has lost his last four

00:00:27.150 --> 00:00:30.019 
slumping again he has lost his last four
games<00:00:27.260> and<00:00:28.260> I<00:00:28.470> think<00:00:28.680> that<00:00:28.920> that<00:00:29.099> loss<00:00:29.550> versus

00:00:30.019 --> 00:00:30.029 
games and I think that that loss versus

00:00:30.029 --> 00:00:32.240 
games and I think that that loss versus
flash<00:00:30.330> on<00:00:30.599> Monty<00:00:30.960> Hall<00:00:31.170> has<00:00:31.500> really<00:00:31.890> dented

00:00:32.240 --> 00:00:32.250 
flash on Monty Hall has really dented

00:00:32.250 --> 00:00:34.490 
flash on Monty Hall has really dented
his<00:00:32.309> confidence<00:00:32.910> in<00:00:33.059> ways<00:00:33.989> that<00:00:34.020> we<00:00:34.320> cannot

00:00:34.490 --> 00:00:34.500 
his confidence in ways that we cannot

00:00:34.500 --> 00:00:36.080 
his confidence in ways that we cannot
even<00:00:34.680> begin<00:00:34.920> to<00:00:35.219> measure<00:00:35.370> because<00:00:35.640> he<00:00:35.910> just

00:00:36.080 --> 00:00:36.090 
even begin to measure because he just

00:00:36.090 --> 00:00:37.610 
even begin to measure because he just
hasn't<00:00:36.329> been<00:00:36.540> the<00:00:36.630> same<00:00:36.719> player<00:00:37.140> since<00:00:37.380> that

00:00:37.610 --> 00:00:37.620 
hasn't been the same player since that

00:00:37.620 --> 00:00:41.119 
hasn't been the same player since that
game<00:00:37.860> he<00:00:38.610> lost<00:00:38.899> without<00:00:39.899> profile<00:00:40.379> providing

00:00:41.119 --> 00:00:41.129 
game he lost without profile providing

00:00:41.129 --> 00:00:43.490 
game he lost without profile providing
too<00:00:41.250> much<00:00:41.370> resistance<00:00:41.550> to<00:00:42.000> iris<00:00:42.360> on<00:00:43.110> geometry

00:00:43.490 --> 00:00:43.500 
too much resistance to iris on geometry

00:00:43.500 --> 00:00:45.139 
too much resistance to iris on geometry
a<00:00:43.829> couple<00:00:44.250> weeks<00:00:44.399> ago<00:00:44.489> and<00:00:44.760> more<00:00:44.969> recently

00:00:45.139 --> 00:00:45.149 
a couple weeks ago and more recently

00:00:45.149 --> 00:00:49.459 
a couple weeks ago and more recently
just<00:00:46.050> a<00:00:46.140> few<00:00:46.230> days<00:00:46.379> ago<00:00:46.590> he<00:00:46.860> lost<00:00:47.010> two<00:00:47.430> I<00:00:48.469> think

00:00:49.459 --> 00:00:49.469 
just a few days ago he lost two I think

00:00:49.469 --> 00:00:51.350 
just a few days ago he lost two I think
it<00:00:49.559> was<00:00:49.649> jaedong<00:00:50.070> on<00:00:50.340> shin<00:00:50.670> peaks<00:00:50.940> of<00:00:51.059> Mackay

00:00:51.350 --> 00:00:51.360 
it was jaedong on shin peaks of Mackay

00:00:51.360 --> 00:00:53.119 
it was jaedong on shin peaks of Mackay
do<00:00:51.420> actually<00:00:51.899> I<00:00:51.960> was<00:00:52.260> it<00:00:52.440> was<00:00:52.559> jaedong<00:00:52.920> and

00:00:53.119 --> 00:00:53.129 
do actually I was it was jaedong and

00:00:53.129 --> 00:00:55.490 
do actually I was it was jaedong and
 Pig<00:00:53.430> sigma<00:00:53.670> k<00:00:53.820> do<00:00:53.879> and<00:00:54.149> he<00:00:55.079> lost<00:00:55.260> very

00:00:55.490 --> 00:00:55.500 
 Pig sigma k do and he lost very

00:00:55.500 --> 00:00:57.080 
 Pig sigma k do and he lost very
uncharacteristically<00:00:56.489> because<00:00:56.850> he<00:00:56.969> was

00:00:57.080 --> 00:00:57.090 
uncharacteristically because he was

00:00:57.090 --> 00:00:58.700 
uncharacteristically because he was
careless<00:00:57.390> and<00:00:57.600> just<00:00:57.930> allowed<00:00:58.140> jaedong<00:00:58.559> to

00:00:58.700 --> 00:00:58.710 
careless and just allowed jaedong to

00:00:58.710 --> 00:01:00.560 
careless and just allowed jaedong to
overwhelm<00:00:59.129> him<00:00:59.280> with<00:00:59.309> Rowling's<00:00:59.969> and<00:01:00.120> that's

00:01:00.560 --> 00:01:00.570 
overwhelm him with Rowling's and that's

00:01:00.570 --> 00:01:01.670 
overwhelm him with Rowling's and that's
just<00:01:00.660> not<00:01:00.840> the<00:01:00.960> kind<00:01:01.140> of<00:01:01.230> play<00:01:01.440> we<00:01:01.559> would

00:01:01.670 --> 00:01:01.680 
just not the kind of play we would

00:01:01.680 --> 00:01:03.709 
just not the kind of play we would
expect<00:01:01.980> from<00:01:02.160> a<00:01:02.399> player<00:01:02.940> like<00:01:02.969> me<00:01:03.570> who

00:01:03.709 --> 00:01:03.719 
expect from a player like me who

00:01:03.719 --> 00:01:06.500 
expect from a player like me who
normally<00:01:03.949> makes<00:01:04.949> no<00:01:05.159> mistakes<00:01:05.610> and<00:01:05.850> is<00:01:06.090> lethal

00:01:06.500 --> 00:01:06.510 
normally makes no mistakes and is lethal

00:01:06.510 --> 00:01:09.320 
normally makes no mistakes and is lethal
in<00:01:07.110> his<00:01:07.320> gameplay<00:01:07.799> so<00:01:08.220> I'm<00:01:08.400> looking<00:01:08.970> to<00:01:09.000> see<00:01:09.180> if

00:01:09.320 --> 00:01:09.330 
in his gameplay so I'm looking to see if

00:01:09.330 --> 00:01:11.000 
in his gameplay so I'm looking to see if
maybe<00:01:09.540> we<00:01:09.689> will<00:01:10.140> hopefully<00:01:10.350> start<00:01:10.830> to<00:01:10.890> see<00:01:10.979> a

00:01:11.000 --> 00:01:11.010 
maybe we will hopefully start to see a

00:01:11.010 --> 00:01:12.649 
maybe we will hopefully start to see a
few<00:01:11.220> signs<00:01:11.430> of<00:01:11.580> recovery<00:01:11.700> from<00:01:12.119> him<00:01:12.330> in<00:01:12.510> this

00:01:12.649 --> 00:01:12.659 
few signs of recovery from him in this

00:01:12.659 --> 00:01:15.469 
few signs of recovery from him in this
game<00:01:12.780> and<00:01:13.560> if<00:01:13.860> he<00:01:14.250> can<00:01:14.430> start<00:01:14.939> to<00:01:15.090> regain<00:01:15.360> some

00:01:15.469 --> 00:01:15.479 
game and if he can start to regain some

00:01:15.479 --> 00:01:16.910 
game and if he can start to regain some
of<00:01:15.540> that<00:01:15.689> form<00:01:15.930> because<00:01:16.200> he<00:01:16.290> did<00:01:16.500> look<00:01:16.710> like<00:01:16.740> he

00:01:16.910 --> 00:01:16.920 
of that form because he did look like he

00:01:16.920 --> 00:01:18.170 
of that form because he did look like he
was<00:01:17.040> coming<00:01:17.400> back<00:01:17.549> into<00:01:17.790> form<00:01:18.119> and

00:01:18.170 --> 00:01:18.180 
was coming back into form and

00:01:18.180 --> 00:01:20.780 
was coming back into form and
unfortunately<00:01:18.960> for<00:01:19.200> Ruby<00:01:19.560> he<00:01:20.130> lost<00:01:20.340> playing

00:01:20.780 --> 00:01:20.790 
unfortunately for Ruby he lost playing

00:01:20.790 --> 00:01:22.249 
unfortunately for Ruby he lost playing
some<00:01:21.030> good<00:01:21.150> Starcraft<00:01:21.720> and<00:01:21.869> this<00:01:22.049> is<00:01:22.229> a

other Protoss players on laughs like

beasts<00:02:16.970> who<00:02:17.090> rushed<00:02:17.360> twice<00:02:17.690> in<00:02:17.870> a<00:02:17.930> row<00:02:18.049> I<00:02:18.290> was

00:02:18.789 --> 00:02:18.799 
beasts who rushed twice in a row I was

00:02:18.799 --> 00:02:19.839 
beasts who rushed twice in a row I was
thought<00:02:19.010> the<00:02:19.040> Protoss<00:02:19.430> players<00:02:19.640> would<00:02:19.760> be

00:02:19.839 --> 00:02:19.849 
thought the Protoss players would be

00:02:19.849 --> 00:02:21.339 
thought the Protoss players would be
much<00:02:20.030> more<00:02:20.060> aware<00:02:20.510> and<00:02:20.569> would<00:02:20.810> start<00:02:21.080> scouting

00:02:21.339 --> 00:02:21.349 
much more aware and would start scouting

00:02:21.349 --> 00:02:22.660 
much more aware and would start scouting
earlier<00:02:21.799> on<00:02:21.920> to<00:02:22.099> make<00:02:22.250> sure<00:02:22.400> that<00:02:22.549> they<00:02:22.640> are

00:02:22.660 --> 00:02:22.670 
earlier on to make sure that they are

00:02:22.670 --> 00:02:24.369 
earlier on to make sure that they are
not<00:02:22.790> good<00:02:22.970> to<00:02:23.060> be<00:02:23.090> restricted<00:02:23.989> to<00:02:24.019> a<00:02:24.110> similar

00:02:24.369 --> 00:02:24.379 
not good to be restricted to a similar

00:02:24.379 --> 00:02:25.539 
not good to be restricted to a similar
fate<00:02:24.680> they're<00:02:24.860> not<00:02:24.950> going<00:02:25.069> to<00:02:25.160> be<00:02:25.220> consigned

00:02:25.539 --> 00:02:25.549 
fate they're not going to be consigned

00:02:25.549 --> 00:02:27.430 
fate they're not going to be consigned
to<00:02:25.730> a<00:02:25.790> similar<00:02:26.090> fate<00:02:26.269> but<00:02:26.750> the<00:02:26.810> movie<00:02:27.260> doesn't

00:02:27.430 --> 00:02:27.440 
to a similar fate but the movie doesn't

00:02:27.440 --> 00:02:28.869 
to a similar fate but the movie doesn't
seem<00:02:27.650> to<00:02:27.739> be<00:02:27.799> blocking<00:02:28.069> off<00:02:28.280> his<00:02:28.459> room<00:02:28.640> so<00:02:28.790> it

00:02:28.869 --> 00:02:28.879 
seem to be blocking off his room so it

00:02:28.879 --> 00:02:30.309 
seem to be blocking off his room so it
doesn't<00:02:29.120> look<00:02:29.180> like<00:02:29.239> he<00:02:29.480> has<00:02:29.629> an<00:02:29.810> intention<00:02:30.230> of

doesn't look like he has an intention of
rushing<00:02:30.680> challenge<00:02:31.340> only<00:02:31.610> not<00:02:31.730> putting<00:02:32.000> up<00:02:32.120> at

center<00:03:02.660> and<00:03:02.840> the<00:03:02.959> challenge<00:03:03.319> might<00:03:03.470> find

00:03:03.729 --> 00:03:03.739 
center and the challenge might find

00:03:03.739 --> 00:03:04.690 
center and the challenge might find
itself<00:03:03.889> a<00:03:04.010> little<00:03:04.069> bit<00:03:04.250> of<00:03:04.340> trouble<00:03:04.519> because

00:03:04.690 --> 00:03:04.700 
itself a little bit of trouble because

00:03:04.700 --> 00:03:06.610 
itself a little bit of trouble because
he's<00:03:04.790> only<00:03:04.940> got<00:03:05.180> that<00:03:05.329> gateway<00:03:05.540> up<00:03:05.780> now<00:03:05.959> he<00:03:06.470> is

00:03:06.610 --> 00:03:06.620 
he's only got that gateway up now he is

00:03:06.620 --> 00:03:08.620 
he's only got that gateway up now he is
getting<00:03:06.889> his<00:03:06.950> tech<00:03:07.160> up<00:03:07.310> so<00:03:07.549> if<00:03:07.790> will<00:03:08.420> be

00:03:08.620 --> 00:03:08.630 
getting his tech up so if will be

00:03:08.630 --> 00:03:10.420 
getting his tech up so if will be
because<00:03:09.260> a<00:03:09.290> challenge<00:03:09.799> not<00:03:09.889> with<00:03:10.069> the<00:03:10.130> second

00:03:10.420 --> 00:03:10.430 
because a challenge not with the second

00:03:10.430 --> 00:03:11.710 
because a challenge not with the second
gateway<00:03:10.549> as<00:03:10.700> well<00:03:10.850> inside<00:03:11.090> the<00:03:11.299> cybernetics

00:03:11.710 --> 00:03:11.720 
gateway as well inside the cybernetics

00:03:11.720 --> 00:03:13.449 
gateway as well inside the cybernetics
core<00:03:11.840> so<00:03:12.170> we<00:03:12.380> will<00:03:12.620> need<00:03:12.769> to<00:03:12.799> do<00:03:12.950> significant

00:03:13.449 --> 00:03:13.459 
core so we will need to do significant

00:03:13.459 --> 00:03:14.979 
core so we will need to do significant
damage<00:03:13.579> to<00:03:13.790> child<00:03:14.090> ranch<00:03:14.269> kind<00:03:14.540> of<00:03:14.600> early<00:03:14.720> on

curious removing again its assigned to
me<00:03:37.940> that<00:03:38.090> he<00:03:38.180> isn't<00:03:38.209> at<00:03:38.569> his<00:03:38.660> best<00:03:38.870> that<00:03:39.019> he

00:03:39.099 --> 00:03:39.109 
me that he isn't at his best that he

00:03:39.109 --> 00:03:40.390 
me that he isn't at his best that he
isn't<00:03:39.319> playing<00:03:39.500> the<00:03:39.709> best<00:03:39.829> starcraft<00:03:40.220> that<00:03:40.340> he

isn't playing the best starcraft that he
should<00:03:40.519> be<00:03:40.639> pulling<00:03:40.760> and<00:03:41.000> I<00:03:41.030> think<00:03:41.180> his

00:03:41.259 --> 00:03:41.269 
should be pulling and I think his

00:03:41.269 --> 00:03:42.940 
should be pulling and I think his
