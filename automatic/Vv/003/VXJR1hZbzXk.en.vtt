should<00:00:54.219> keep<00:00:54.399> me<00:00:54.489> afloat<00:00:54.730> and<00:00:54.969> want<00:00:55.120> it<00:00:55.179> best

00:00:55.319 --> 00:00:55.329 
should keep me afloat and want it best

00:00:55.329 --> 00:01:04.940 
should keep me afloat and want it best
to<00:00:55.390> my<00:00:55.510> here<00:00:55.780> to<00:00:55.870> see<00:00:55.989> my<00:00:56.140> hip<00:00:56.320> goes<00:00:56.530> down

00:01:04.940 --> 00:01:04.950 

00:01:04.950 --> 00:01:09.270 

very<00:01:05.950> floaty<00:01:06.630> initially<00:01:07.630> I<00:01:07.840> think<00:01:08.710> now<00:01:09.070> I'll

00:01:09.270 --> 00:01:09.280 
very floaty initially I think now I'll

00:01:09.280 --> 00:01:20.880 
very floaty initially I think now I'll
let<00:01:09.970> them<00:01:10.119> fill<00:01:10.360> up<00:01:10.450> with<00:01:10.540> water<00:01:19.470> so<00:01:20.470> once<00:01:20.680> they

00:01:20.880 --> 00:01:20.890 
let them fill up with water so once they

00:01:20.890 --> 00:01:23.760 
let them fill up with water so once they
start<00:01:21.190> to<00:01:21.310> fill<00:01:21.520> up<00:01:21.960> obviously<00:01:22.960> they'd<00:01:23.530> be<00:01:23.590> a

00:01:23.760 --> 00:01:23.770 
start to fill up obviously they'd be a

00:01:23.770 --> 00:01:26.070 
start to fill up obviously they'd be a
little<00:01:23.950> bit<00:01:24.040> trickier<00:01:24.430> to<00:01:24.460> move<00:01:24.759> I<00:01:25.149> mean<00:01:25.990> you

00:01:26.070 --> 00:01:26.080 
little bit trickier to move I mean you

00:01:26.080 --> 00:01:30.510 
little bit trickier to move I mean you
can<00:01:26.200> see<00:01:28.770> they're<00:01:29.770> filled<00:01:30.009> all<00:01:30.130> about<00:01:30.310> there

00:01:30.510 --> 00:01:30.520 
can see they're filled all about there

00:01:30.520 --> 00:01:34.260 
can see they're filled all about there
right<00:01:30.550> now<00:01:30.990> and<00:01:31.990> it's<00:01:32.170> very<00:01:32.789> very<00:01:33.789> hard<00:01:34.119> to

00:01:34.260 --> 00:01:34.270 
right now and it's very very hard to

00:01:34.270 --> 00:01:36.930 
right now and it's very very hard to
move<00:01:34.390> around<00:01:35.160> let's<00:01:36.160> get<00:01:36.340> back<00:01:36.550> in<00:01:36.700> the<00:01:36.789> water

00:01:36.930 --> 00:01:36.940 
move around let's get back in the water

00:01:36.940 --> 00:01:39.359 
move around let's get back in the water
though<00:01:37.210> the<00:01:38.110> pressure<00:01:38.380> of<00:01:38.590> the<00:01:38.679> water<00:01:38.830> around

00:01:39.359 --> 00:01:39.369 
though the pressure of the water around

00:01:39.369 --> 00:01:41.639 
though the pressure of the water around
them<00:01:39.759> tends<00:01:40.570> to<00:01:40.690> push<00:01:40.869> the<00:01:41.020> water<00:01:41.140> up<00:01:41.320> and<00:01:41.500> out

00:01:41.639 --> 00:01:41.649 
them tends to push the water up and out

00:01:41.649 --> 00:01:43.290 
them tends to push the water up and out
and<00:01:41.770> they<00:01:41.890> actually<00:01:41.950> not<00:01:42.460> as<00:01:42.580> bad<00:01:42.610> as<00:01:43.000> that<00:01:43.149> is

00:01:43.290 --> 00:01:43.300 
and they actually not as bad as that is

00:01:43.300 --> 00:01:46.590 
and they actually not as bad as that is
trying<00:01:44.259> to<00:01:44.350> move<00:01:44.470> around<00:01:44.590> I'll<00:01:44.800> and<00:01:45.479> I'll<00:01:46.479> see

00:01:46.590 --> 00:01:46.600 
trying to move around I'll and I'll see

00:01:46.600 --> 00:01:57.169 
trying to move around I'll and I'll see
y'all<00:01:46.750> go<00:01:46.929> they're<00:01:47.080> gonna<00:01:47.140> swim

00:01:57.169 --> 00:01:57.179 

00:01:57.179 --> 00:02:00.389 

actually<00:01:58.179> gotten<00:01:58.420> easier<00:01:58.830> I'll<00:01:59.830> get<00:01:59.979> a<00:02:00.009> leg<00:02:00.250> up

00:02:00.389 --> 00:02:00.399 
actually gotten easier I'll get a leg up

00:02:00.399 --> 00:02:05.999 
actually gotten easier I'll get a leg up
I<00:02:00.580> can<00:02:00.729> move<00:02:00.850> around<00:02:01.210> a<00:02:04.409> lot<00:02:05.409> easier<00:02:05.799> in<00:02:05.920> the

00:02:05.999 --> 00:02:06.009 
I can move around a lot easier in the

00:02:06.009 --> 00:02:09.389 
I can move around a lot easier in the
water<00:02:06.189> than<00:02:06.369> it<00:02:06.430> is<00:02:06.549> out<00:02:07.950> sitting<00:02:08.950> here<00:02:09.160> some

00:02:09.389 --> 00:02:09.399 
water than it is out sitting here some

00:02:09.399 --> 00:02:24.020 
water than it is out sitting here some
other<00:02:09.429> stuff

00:02:24.020 --> 00:02:24.030

00:02:30.179 --> 00:02:30.189 
water out of the waders if you get it a

00:02:30.189 --> 00:02:31.440 
water out of the waders if you get it a
little<00:02:30.310> bit<00:02:30.430> too<00:02:30.579> high<00:02:30.760> so<00:02:31.000> I'm<00:02:31.060> gonna<00:02:31.150> wander

00:02:31.440 --> 00:02:31.450 
little bit too high so I'm gonna wander

00:02:31.450 --> 00:02:36.589 
little bit too high so I'm gonna wander
in<00:02:31.689> with<00:02:32.680> this<00:02:32.799> belt<00:02:33.099> on<00:02:33.340> around<00:02:33.579> my<00:02:33.670> waist<00:02:35.099> and

00:02:38.799 --> 00:02:40.979 
see just how much water that keeps out
on<00:02:38.889> the<00:02:38.950> waders<00:02:39.250> I<00:02:39.510> suspect<00:02:40.510> it<00:02:40.629> will<00:02:40.689> do<00:02:40.840> quite

00:02:40.979 --> 00:02:40.989 
on the waders I suspect it will do quite

00:02:40.989 --> 00:02:57.179 
on the waders I suspect it will do quite
well<00:02:54.209> you<00:02:55.209> can<00:02:55.359> hear<00:02:55.689> a<00:02:55.959> little<00:02:56.709> bit<00:02:56.919> of<00:02:57.040> water

00:02:57.179 --> 00:02:57.189 
well you can hear a little bit of water

00:02:57.189 --> 00:02:59.429 
well you can hear a little bit of water
just<00:02:57.459> creeping<00:02:57.730> down<00:02:58.030> through<00:02:58.659> there<00:02:58.780> through

00:02:59.429 --> 00:02:59.439 
just creeping down through there through

00:02:59.439 --> 00:03:02.420 
just creeping down through there through
the<00:02:59.590> folds<00:03:00.040> but<00:03:00.419> that<00:03:01.419> would<00:03:01.540> prolong<00:03:01.900> your

00:03:02.420 --> 00:03:02.430 
the folds but that would prolong your

00:03:02.430 --> 00:03:04.830 
the folds but that would prolong your
mobility<00:03:03.430> in<00:03:03.699> the<00:03:03.790> water<00:03:03.969> by<00:03:04.180> a<00:03:04.209> lot<00:03:04.510> I<00:03:04.689> would

00:03:04.830 --> 00:03:04.840 
mobility in the water by a lot I would

00:03:04.840 --> 00:03:07.429 
mobility in the water by a lot I would
think

00:03:07.429 --> 00:03:07.439 

00:03:07.439 --> 00:03:10.409 

simple<00:03:08.439> be<00:03:08.769> a<00:03:08.799> lifesaver<00:03:09.189> and<00:03:09.909> the<00:03:10.120> addition

00:03:10.409 --> 00:03:10.419 
simple be a lifesaver and the addition

00:03:10.419 --> 00:03:14.119 
simple be a lifesaver and the addition
of<00:03:10.480> a<00:03:10.599> PFD<00:03:10.930> on<00:03:11.260> top<00:03:11.500> a<00:03:11.530> live<00:03:11.799> chicken<00:03:11.980> would<00:03:12.969> be

00:03:14.119 --> 00:03:14.129 
of a PFD on top a live chicken would be

00:03:14.129 --> 00:03:19.199 
of a PFD on top a live chicken would be
even<00:03:15.129> better<00:03:15.250> once<00:03:15.489> again<00:03:15.849> offshore<00:03:18.000> so<00:03:19.000> just

00:03:19.199 --> 00:03:19.209 
even better once again offshore so just

00:03:19.209 --> 00:03:24.449 
even better once again offshore so just
putting<00:03:19.389> a<00:03:19.569> putting<00:03:20.409> a<00:03:20.470> live<00:03:20.650> chicken<00:03:20.829> on<00:03:23.459> it

00:03:24.449 --> 00:03:24.459 
putting a putting a live chicken on it

00:03:24.459 --> 00:03:25.679 
putting a putting a live chicken on it
seems<00:03:24.669> strange<00:03:25.000> to<00:03:25.060> me<00:03:25.209> that<00:03:25.239> people<00:03:25.509> would

00:03:25.679 --> 00:03:25.689 
seems strange to me that people would

00:03:25.689 --> 00:03:28.589 
seems strange to me that people would
even<00:03:25.840> consider<00:03:26.159> going<00:03:27.159> in<00:03:27.430> a<00:03:27.519> river<00:03:27.729> with

00:03:28.589 --> 00:03:28.599 
even consider going in a river with

00:03:28.599 --> 00:03:32.909 
even consider going in a river with
waders<00:03:29.139> and<00:03:29.729> not<00:03:30.729> a<00:03:30.759> lifejacket<00:03:31.150> I<00:03:31.540> just<00:03:31.919> you

00:03:32.909 --> 00:03:32.919 
waders and not a lifejacket I just you

00:03:32.919 --> 00:03:34.469 
waders and not a lifejacket I just you
know<00:03:32.949> the<00:03:33.250> fact<00:03:33.489> even<00:03:33.759> if<00:03:33.909> these<00:03:34.090> things<00:03:34.359> that

00:03:34.469 --> 00:03:34.479 
know the fact even if these things that

00:03:34.479 --> 00:03:35.879 
know the fact even if these things that
do<00:03:34.659> provide<00:03:34.780> amount<00:03:35.229> of<00:03:35.319> flotation<00:03:35.739> because

00:03:35.879 --> 00:03:35.889 
do provide amount of flotation because

00:03:35.889 --> 00:03:38.429 
do provide amount of flotation because
they're<00:03:36.040> neoprene<00:03:36.870> the<00:03:37.870> floatation<00:03:38.290> is<00:03:38.319> all

00:03:38.429 --> 00:03:38.439 
they're neoprene the floatation is all

00:03:38.439 --> 00:03:41.460 
they're neoprene the floatation is all
your<00:03:38.620> league's<00:03:38.829> I<00:03:39.329> mean<00:03:40.329> these<00:03:40.659> are<00:03:40.810> warm<00:03:41.049> they

00:03:53.600 --> 00:03:53.610 

00:03:53.610 --> 00:04:03.540 

so<00:03:54.610> much<00:03:54.849> higher<00:03:55.090> out<00:03:55.450> of<00:03:55.480> the<00:03:55.599> water

00:04:03.540 --> 00:04:03.550

00:04:08.250 --> 00:04:10.860 

dramatically<00:04:09.250> different<00:04:09.489> it's<00:04:10.030> so<00:04:10.660> much

00:04:10.860 --> 00:04:10.870 
dramatically different it's so much

00:04:10.870 --> 00:04:11.970 
dramatically different it's so much
higher<00:04:11.110> out<00:04:11.319> of<00:04:11.350> the<00:04:11.470> water<00:04:11.620> with<00:04:11.770> a<00:04:11.830> life

00:04:11.970 --> 00:04:11.980 
higher out of the water with a life

00:04:11.980 --> 00:04:14.670 
higher out of the water with a life
jacket<00:04:12.010> on<00:04:12.720> you'd<00:04:13.720> be<00:04:13.870> a<00:04:13.900> fool<00:04:14.170> to<00:04:14.230> get<00:04:14.590> in

jacket on you'd be a fool to get in
there<00:04:14.830> in<00:04:15.069> the<00:04:15.160> water<00:04:15.310> especially<00:04:16.150> removing

00:04:16.770 --> 00:04:16.780 
there in the water especially removing

00:04:16.780 --> 00:04:21.599 
there in the water especially removing
water<00:04:17.070> without<00:04:18.070> one<00:04:18.280> on<00:04:19.980> it<00:04:20.980> so<00:04:21.220> getting<00:04:21.430> out

00:04:21.599 --> 00:04:21.609 
water without one on it so getting out

water without one on it so getting out
of<00:04:21.760> waders<00:04:21.940> I<00:04:22.360> mean<00:04:23.139> there's<00:04:23.800> this<00:04:23.919> something

00:04:24.180 --> 00:04:24.190 
of waders I mean there's this something

of waders I mean there's this something
you're<00:04:24.280> gonna<00:04:24.370> try<00:04:24.669> and<00:04:24.700> do<00:04:24.910> if<00:04:25.510> you're

00:04:25.710 --> 00:04:25.720 
you're gonna try and do if you're

00:04:25.720 --> 00:04:27.510 
you're gonna try and do if you're
wearing<00:04:25.900> a<00:04:26.020> life<00:04:26.229> jacket<00:04:26.260> over<00:04:27.040> the<00:04:27.280> top<00:04:27.490> of

00:04:27.520 --> 00:04:29.310 
wearing a life jacket over the top of
this<00:04:27.760> then<00:04:28.479> you're<00:04:28.600> going<00:04:28.720> to<00:04:28.810> need<00:04:28.930> to<00:04:29.050> remove

which<00:04:31.570> kind<00:04:31.840> of<00:04:31.900> negates<00:04:32.200> the<00:04:32.350> point<00:04:32.560> of

00:04:32.670 --> 00:04:32.680 
which kind of negates the point of

00:04:32.680 --> 00:04:35.159 
which kind of negates the point of
having<00:04:32.800> one<00:04:33.360> so<00:04:34.360> I'm<00:04:34.570> going<00:04:34.690> to<00:04:34.780> go<00:04:34.870> in<00:04:35.020> without

obvious when you're out there that the

00:06:22.520 --> 00:06:24.940 
obvious when you're out there that the
