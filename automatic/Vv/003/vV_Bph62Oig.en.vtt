00:00:22.560 --> 00:00:26.460
 Hello we'd like to distribute Enzo Chamber firmly and in this series of tricks 

00:00:26.460 --> 00:00:29.619
 I show you the Mambas was Mario Voigt all hunting is going out 

00:00:29.619 --> 00:00:33.170
 he did not travel to the first world any Gollum out there is really always telling us 

00:00:33.170 --> 00:00:35.480
 Just go to the second world 

00:00:35.480 --> 00:00:39.190
 Toledo Athens there I would then attract attention to red dots red dots 

00:00:39.190 --> 00:00:42.530
 mean in this level there are two secret exits 

00:00:42.530 --> 00:00:46.540
 I'll say I'm moving there and then the lunar probe Arbos 

00:00:46.540 --> 00:00:48.890
 let's go see you soon 

00:00:48.890 --> 00:00:52.010
 SoC we have arrived to this place could if he just that would be quite 

00:00:52.010 --> 00:00:54.630
 usually by playing you see I have my mistakes at the vents he 

00:00:54.630 --> 00:00:56.480
 does not necessarily shoot 

00:00:56.480 --> 00:01:00.110
 but the mistakes the feather is important unless you have the green 

00:01:00.110 --> 00:01:02.530
 failed load already you could just be high 

00:01:02.530 --> 00:01:05.870
 through tables to get stuck in the hole and then Wars that 

00:01:06.470 --> 00:01:11.730
 However, parts of Venier in Prüm switch did not fit and found 

00:01:11.730 --> 00:01:13.590
 it decides hand pressed down 

00:01:13.590 --> 00:01:15.760
 also necessarily a mistake 

00:01:15.760 --> 00:01:19.680
 Hiroshi just pulled it a bit of resourcefulness you basically have to be simple 

00:01:19.680 --> 00:01:22.680
 just start up to open 

00:01:23.710 --> 00:01:26.180
 by technically fogging which XII 

00:01:26.180 --> 00:01:30.210
 Umstadt by simple key otherwise in the tape key with Marriot 

00:01:30.210 --> 00:01:31.600
 with dapd 

00:01:31.600 --> 00:01:33.260
 in the keyhole 

00:01:33.260 --> 00:01:39.230
 us the secret action percent with an exit to thunder Siegfried 1 and there 

00:01:39.230 --> 00:01:41.280
 this point is also red 

00:01:41.280 --> 00:01:45.510
 you may see there is a secret exit here as well 

00:01:45.510 --> 00:01:48.510
 We'll see each other more when I'm there 

00:01:49.340 --> 00:01:52.530
 the moral standing in front of a gravel bed this the switch reaches here in the 

00:01:52.530 --> 00:01:54.440
 Minister simply plays through 

00:01:54.440 --> 00:01:57.980
 here you have to go there is swallowed next to seismic skis or with 

00:01:57.980 --> 00:01:59.330
 Mario 

00:01:59.330 --> 00:02:01.490
 easy access 

00:02:01.490 --> 00:02:05.670
 the switch you have to keep and fit as ever with Yoshi plays up 

00:02:05.670 --> 00:02:06.780
 that you XII 

00:02:06.780 --> 00:02:09.780
 this the switch swallowed so right FC Augsburg 

00:02:12.159 --> 00:02:15.089
 they should take them along because they might not have enough time 

00:02:15.089 --> 00:02:17.809
 really only the kids need to be able to store 

00:02:17.809 --> 00:02:19.659
 among them 

00:02:19.659 --> 00:02:23.569
 and in this question mark which is favorable is then a key 

00:02:23.569 --> 00:02:26.569
 in there you can take 

00:02:28.039 --> 00:02:29.069
 and then 

00:02:29.069 --> 00:02:32.069
 it just goes into the keyhole 

00:02:33.519 --> 00:02:35.379
 the own 

00:02:35.379 --> 00:02:38.789
 So it goes into the keyhole 

00:02:38.789 --> 00:02:43.439
 this keyhole IAAF will then turn your way into our big one 

00:02:43.439 --> 00:02:46.439
 House with the normal she comes upstairs 

00:02:47.349 --> 00:02:52.619
 with the normal exit from the thunder she cools housed lacquered in this opera 

00:02:52.619 --> 00:02:55.009
 Surfer through Daum 

00:02:55.009 --> 00:02:57.309
 in the local 2 

00:02:57.309 --> 00:03:00.469
 you get completely comfortable via this tube 

00:03:00.469 --> 00:03:04.579
 to the dollar CAD 3 this could be nice to bypass this inn 

00:03:05.079 --> 00:03:05.939
 but off 

00:03:05.939 --> 00:03:10.059
 I mean let's say we can do the little mouse in the $ 10 clubhouse 

00:03:10.059 --> 00:03:12.669
 see you soon 

00:03:12.669 --> 00:03:16.299
 Again he announces that the switch is also the one you reach when you are completely 

00:03:16.299 --> 00:03:17.539
 just go through 

00:03:17.539 --> 00:03:21.099
 as it will be percent softer so here are two options 

00:03:21.099 --> 00:03:24.099
 give easy exit to find 

00:03:24.809 --> 00:03:28.289
 That's what it's all about. You have to set the coins 

00:03:28.289 --> 00:03:32.529
 take away and then swallow in Pieschen because otherwise shut you Stevenson the 

00:03:32.529 --> 00:03:34.769
 Therefore, to block the way to a blue door 

00:03:34.769 --> 00:03:38.749
 but with second exit you have to go through the gravel with cuffs 

00:03:38.749 --> 00:03:42.059
 can do about this question and slip in this blue door 

00:03:42.059 --> 00:03:46.179
 There is then a field of blue blocks and that is a post they 

00:03:46.179 --> 00:03:49.879
 In this book, Rudigier can pretty easily defeat him by just 

00:03:49.879 --> 00:03:51.759
 This blue block on the print «mostly 

00:03:51.759 --> 00:03:54.439
 this is not a great job 

00:03:54.439 --> 00:03:56.469
 that's just a little bit 

00:03:56.469 --> 00:03:58.169
 associated with time 

00:03:58.169 --> 00:04:01.930
 and that is connected with Löw I had to listen to me talking here 

00:04:01.929 --> 00:04:04.929
 now also because the timing is there is the music train 

00:04:06.569 --> 00:04:08.819
 Allgeier the borders with 

00:04:08.819 --> 00:04:12.690
 the fanfare music of Super Mario World course you got 

00:04:12.690 --> 00:04:15.939
 would have said bunch sentence sentences 

00:04:15.939 --> 00:04:18.029
 and around the country 

00:04:18.029 --> 00:04:19.680
 thereby 

00:04:19.680 --> 00:04:22.909
 to Council Yuen 6 and so is arrogant 

00:04:22.909 --> 00:04:25.909
 it also takes Maas special light leads you into the world of stars 

00:04:26.509 --> 00:04:30.449
 but in a later godfather if you see or equal points 

00:04:30.449 --> 00:04:32.699
 two outputs 

00:04:32.699 --> 00:04:37.660
 we are busy but you once left with CD McDonald 2 

00:04:37.660 --> 00:04:39.669
 a good foundation 

00:04:39.669 --> 00:04:43.800
 and we go and say yes I'm back where I have to go so well 

00:04:45.939 --> 00:04:48.909
 Attention Scrolling I have to join 

00:04:48.909 --> 00:04:52.469
 Year in this district also comes here again when the former quite ordinary 

00:04:52.469 --> 00:04:56.469
 play through otherwise and that just bishop in the nights 

00:04:56.469 --> 00:04:59.259
 use through the pipes through which I have just risen 

00:04:59.259 --> 00:05:02.310
 then Kilianshof climbed a crack not difficult 

00:05:02.310 --> 00:05:04.969
 and I had two options again who alone since 

00:05:04.969 --> 00:05:09.879
 until you get this on coal that is maximum then operator error or I want 

00:05:09.879 --> 00:05:12.319
 be very big otherwise you can just go 

00:05:12.319 --> 00:05:16.349
 Grab tanks and go for it with Joschi the tank 

00:05:16.349 --> 00:05:17.059
 grab 

00:05:17.059 --> 00:05:20.059
 Flying high for many is the hole 

00:05:21.629 --> 00:05:24.659
 That's how you made it to Grace with Spells 

00:05:25.449 --> 00:05:28.449
 But you believe any normal expenses 

00:05:28.960 --> 00:05:30.270
 to the goalkeeper 

00:05:30.270 --> 00:05:33.559
 Donat big do you dare like that 

00:05:33.559 --> 00:05:34.580
 everyone 

00:05:34.580 --> 00:05:37.889
 the output is quite simple, but it took me a long time to get there 

00:05:37.889 --> 00:05:40.370
 Bock came on it you need a spring 

00:05:40.370 --> 00:05:42.379
 hops up 

00:05:42.379 --> 00:05:46.289
 Run this way along the serious whole screen 

00:05:47.460 --> 00:05:51.460
 and you can be among wolves here and there's basically the exit I've got 

00:05:51.460 --> 00:05:52.330
 then again 

00:05:52.330 --> 00:05:55.439
 4 ghostly 

00:05:55.439 --> 00:05:57.969
 where to have sent 

00:05:57.969 --> 00:06:00.710
 he just goes through the exit 

00:06:00.710 --> 00:06:03.710
 and find the secret 

00:06:04.539 --> 00:06:06.689
 that no cabbage 

00:06:06.689 --> 00:06:09.849
 there is the victory ride hair of Mary Jo suffered 

00:06:11.199 --> 00:06:16.229
 Unger this goes out of the books you need so so then got into the 

00:06:16.229 --> 00:06:17.380
 Contini and 6 

00:06:17.380 --> 00:06:20.129
 Screens top title Terrier 

00:06:20.129 --> 00:06:25.550
 No matter the "Top Secret" RW Ahlen there is a month and optionally two 

00:06:25.550 --> 00:06:29.710
 Fire flowers or two feathers or one as you would like it to be 

00:06:29.709 --> 00:06:33.479
 there could then run around a beer out of just so directs 

00:06:34.249 --> 00:06:38.669
 these were all exits in Liberec 2 and thus that it was also the end of the BND 

00:06:38.669 --> 00:06:41.199
 the first part is the EBIT of the first part 

00:06:41.199 --> 00:06:44.199
 Next year, we will be dealing with it »the Berlin Cathedral 

00:06:44.740 --> 00:06:47.690
 on Michaela again and to this value until then
