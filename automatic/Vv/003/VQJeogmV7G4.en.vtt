about<00:00:06.600> the<00:00:07.170> steam<00:00:07.379> controller<00:00:08.000> so<00:00:09.000> as<00:00:09.120> we<00:00:09.240> can

00:00:09.350 --> 00:00:09.360 
about the steam controller so as we can

00:00:09.360 --> 00:00:11.240 
about the steam controller so as we can
see<00:00:09.420> on<00:00:09.719> the<00:00:09.780> front<00:00:09.990> of<00:00:10.050> the<00:00:10.139> controller<00:00:10.500> we

00:00:11.240 --> 00:00:11.250 
see on the front of the controller we

00:00:11.250 --> 00:00:12.589 
see on the front of the controller we
have<00:00:11.280> our<00:00:11.519> two<00:00:11.670> touch<00:00:11.849> pads<00:00:12.090> both<00:00:12.330> of<00:00:12.509> which

00:00:12.589 --> 00:00:12.599 
have our two touch pads both of which

00:00:12.599 --> 00:00:17.029 
have our two touch pads both of which
click<00:00:12.870> down<00:00:13.049> buttons<00:00:13.830> a<00:00:14.070> B<00:00:14.400> X&amp;Y<00:00:15.350> start<00:00:16.350> select

00:00:17.029 --> 00:00:17.039 
click down buttons a B X&amp;Y start select

00:00:17.039 --> 00:00:19.189 
click down buttons a B X&amp;Y start select
some<00:00:17.640> kind<00:00:17.820> of<00:00:17.880> home<00:00:18.090> key<00:00:18.330> I'm<00:00:18.449> guessing<00:00:18.810> as

00:00:19.189 --> 00:00:19.199 
some kind of home key I'm guessing as

00:00:19.199 --> 00:00:20.870 
some kind of home key I'm guessing as
well<00:00:19.410> as<00:00:19.500> these<00:00:19.680> four<00:00:20.010> buttons<00:00:20.430> that<00:00:20.789> are

00:00:20.870 --> 00:00:20.880 
well as these four buttons that are

00:00:20.880 --> 00:00:22.550 
well as these four buttons that are
gonna<00:00:21.180> be<00:00:21.330> replaced<00:00:21.689> by<00:00:21.840> a<00:00:21.869> touchpad<00:00:22.320> in<00:00:22.470> the

00:00:22.550 --> 00:00:22.560 
gonna be replaced by a touchpad in the

00:00:22.560 --> 00:00:25.340 
gonna be replaced by a touchpad in the
full<00:00:22.740> release<00:00:23.150> the<00:00:24.150> bottom<00:00:24.750> doesn't<00:00:25.019> look<00:00:25.140> too

00:00:25.340 --> 00:00:25.350 
full release the bottom doesn't look too

00:00:25.350 --> 00:00:27.290 
full release the bottom doesn't look too
interesting<00:00:25.859> but<00:00:26.430> the<00:00:26.550> side<00:00:26.730> is<00:00:26.880> kind<00:00:27.000> of<00:00:27.119> cool

00:00:27.290 --> 00:00:27.300 
interesting but the side is kind of cool

00:00:27.300 --> 00:00:29.419 
interesting but the side is kind of cool
because<00:00:27.599> you<00:00:27.869> can<00:00:28.019> see<00:00:28.230> the<00:00:28.740> main<00:00:29.099> difference

00:00:29.419 --> 00:00:29.429 
because you can see the main difference

00:00:29.429 --> 00:00:32.060 
because you can see the main difference
in<00:00:29.550> the<00:00:29.640> grips<00:00:30.170> this<00:00:31.170> is<00:00:31.289> one's<00:00:31.470> kind<00:00:31.710> of<00:00:31.740> hump

00:00:32.060 --> 00:00:32.070 
in the grips this is one's kind of hump

00:00:32.070 --> 00:00:35.389 
in the grips this is one's kind of hump
up<00:00:32.250> and<00:00:32.870> most<00:00:33.870> modern<00:00:34.559> controllers<00:00:35.040> have<00:00:35.370> a

00:00:35.389 --> 00:00:35.399 
up and most modern controllers have a

00:00:35.399 --> 00:00:37.670 
up and most modern controllers have a
downward<00:00:35.640> angle<00:00:35.850> on<00:00:36.149> them<00:00:36.360> so<00:00:36.660> I<00:00:36.870> suspect<00:00:37.290> that

00:00:37.670 --> 00:00:37.680 
downward angle on them so I suspect that

00:00:37.680 --> 00:00:39.680 
downward angle on them so I suspect that
this<00:00:37.829> is<00:00:37.890> so<00:00:38.250> it<00:00:38.460> raises<00:00:38.670> your<00:00:38.850> palms<00:00:39.210> up<00:00:39.480> so

00:00:39.680 --> 00:00:39.690 
this is so it raises your palms up so

00:00:39.690 --> 00:00:41.420 
this is so it raises your palms up so
that<00:00:39.840> it<00:00:39.930> gives<00:00:40.050> your<00:00:40.200> thumbs<00:00:40.469> a<00:00:40.800> better

00:00:41.420 --> 00:00:41.430 
that it gives your thumbs a better

00:00:41.430 --> 00:00:44.330 
that it gives your thumbs a better
contact<00:00:42.270> with<00:00:42.450> the<00:00:42.660> touch<00:00:42.840> pads<00:00:43.079> you<00:00:44.070> can<00:00:44.100> kind

00:00:44.330 --> 00:00:44.340 
contact with the touch pads you can kind

00:00:44.340 --> 00:00:45.770 
contact with the touch pads you can kind
of<00:00:44.399> see<00:00:44.550> on<00:00:44.579> the<00:00:44.730> top<00:00:44.940> that<00:00:45.180> there's<00:00:45.539> the

00:00:45.770 --> 00:00:45.780 
of see on the top that there's the

00:00:45.780 --> 00:00:47.779 
of see on the top that there's the
regular<00:00:45.989> dual<00:00:46.770> trigger<00:00:47.070> and<00:00:47.340> do<00:00:47.430> a<00:00:47.460> bumper

00:00:47.779 --> 00:00:47.789 
regular dual trigger and do a bumper

00:00:47.789 --> 00:00:49.490 
regular dual trigger and do a bumper
setup<00:00:48.059> as<00:00:48.390> well<00:00:48.660> as<00:00:48.750> these<00:00:48.899> paddles<00:00:49.260> on<00:00:49.410> the

00:00:49.490 --> 00:00:49.500 
setup as well as these paddles on the

00:00:49.500 --> 00:00:51.319 
setup as well as these paddles on the
back<00:00:49.649> which<00:00:49.860> I<00:00:50.010> find<00:00:50.250> really<00:00:50.460> interesting<00:00:50.730> and

00:00:51.319 --> 00:00:51.329 
back which I find really interesting and

00:00:51.329 --> 00:00:52.850 
back which I find really interesting and
just<00:00:51.570> I'm<00:00:51.840> surprised<00:00:52.199> we<00:00:52.410> haven't<00:00:52.680> seen

00:00:52.850 --> 00:00:52.860 
just I'm surprised we haven't seen

00:00:52.860 --> 00:00:54.650 
just I'm surprised we haven't seen
before<00:00:53.370> and<00:00:53.789> controller<00:00:54.120> design<00:00:54.449> honestly

00:00:54.650 --> 00:00:54.660 
before and controller design honestly

00:00:54.660 --> 00:00:56.450 
before and controller design honestly
but<00:00:55.500> they're<00:00:55.770> definitely<00:00:56.010> one<00:00:56.280> of<00:00:56.370> my

00:00:56.450 --> 00:00:56.460 
but they're definitely one of my

00:00:56.460 --> 00:00:58.910 
but they're definitely one of my
favorite<00:00:56.760> features<00:00:56.960> that<00:00:57.960> being<00:00:58.199> said<00:00:58.469> let's

00:00:58.910 --> 00:00:58.920 
favorite features that being said let's

favorite features that being said let's
get<00:00:59.070> this<00:00:59.190> in<00:00:59.340> action<00:00:59.609> so<00:00:59.760> you<00:00:59.789> guys<00:01:00.000> can<00:01:00.210> see

00:01:00.319 --> 00:01:00.329 
get this in action so you guys can see

00:01:00.329 --> 00:01:02.060 
get this in action so you guys can see
how<00:01:00.510> it<00:01:00.629> handles<00:01:00.750> some<00:01:01.020> game<00:01:01.170> play<00:01:01.199> the<00:01:01.620> game

00:01:02.060 --> 00:01:02.070 
how it handles some game play the game

00:01:02.070 --> 00:01:03.290 
how it handles some game play the game
I'm<00:01:02.309> going<00:01:02.430> to<00:01:02.520> show<00:01:02.640> you<00:01:02.670> guys<00:01:02.850> footage<00:01:03.180> of

00:01:03.290 --> 00:01:03.300 
I'm going to show you guys footage of

00:01:03.300 --> 00:01:05.270 
I'm going to show you guys footage of
today<00:01:03.570> is<00:01:03.629> the<00:01:03.870> valve<00:01:04.049> classic<00:01:04.439> portal<00:01:04.799> which

00:01:05.270 --> 00:01:05.280 
today is the valve classic portal which

00:01:05.280 --> 00:01:07.340 
today is the valve classic portal which
is<00:01:05.640> not<00:01:05.970> very<00:01:06.210> demanding<00:01:06.479> on<00:01:06.750> a<00:01:06.780> controller<00:01:07.140> so

00:01:07.340 --> 00:01:07.350 
is not very demanding on a controller so

00:01:07.350 --> 00:01:08.060 
is not very demanding on a controller so
I<00:01:07.380> thought<00:01:07.560> it<00:01:07.650> would<00:01:07.770> be<00:01:07.830> a<00:01:07.860> good

00:01:08.060 --> 00:01:08.070 
I thought it would be a good

00:01:08.070 --> 00:01:10.760 
I thought it would be a good
representation<00:01:08.460> for<00:01:09.299> a<00:01:09.330> test<00:01:09.630> also<00:01:10.439> I<00:01:10.470> already

00:01:10.760 --> 00:01:10.770 
representation for a test also I already

00:01:10.770 --> 00:01:12.500 
representation for a test also I already
know<00:01:10.860> how<00:01:10.979> to<00:01:11.010> solve<00:01:11.280> all<00:01:11.369> the<00:01:11.460> puzzles<00:01:11.580> so<00:01:12.090> you

00:01:12.500 --> 00:01:12.510 
know how to solve all the puzzles so you

00:01:12.510 --> 00:01:14.030 
know how to solve all the puzzles so you
guys<00:01:12.659> don't<00:01:12.810> have<00:01:12.990> to<00:01:13.080> get<00:01:13.170> too<00:01:13.380> frustrated<00:01:13.920> at

and I chose I could jiggle the right
paddle<00:01:26.340> a<00:01:26.369> little<00:01:26.400> bit<00:01:26.700> and<00:01:27.200> just<00:01:28.200> pull<00:01:28.530> the

00:01:36.600 --> 00:01:38.899 
gonna go to my library and I'm going to
bring<00:01:36.720> up<00:01:36.900> world

00:01:38.899 --> 00:01:38.909 
bring up world

00:01:38.909 --> 00:01:41.690 
bring up world
and<00:01:39.000> so<00:01:39.719> we<00:01:40.079> have<00:01:40.259> chief<00:01:40.590> mince<00:01:40.799> you<00:01:41.549> can

00:01:41.690 --> 00:01:41.700 
and so we have chief mince you can

00:01:41.700 --> 00:01:43.550 
and so we have chief mince you can
change<00:01:42.000> your<00:01:42.090> controller<00:01:42.479> bindings<00:01:42.960> here<00:01:43.289> I'm

00:01:43.550 --> 00:01:43.560 
change your controller bindings here I'm

00:01:43.560 --> 00:01:46.010 
change your controller bindings here I'm
just<00:01:43.680> gonna<00:01:43.829> keep<00:01:44.070> them<00:01:44.250> default<00:01:44.759> and<00:01:45.600> of

00:01:46.010 --> 00:01:46.020 
just gonna keep them default and of

00:01:46.020 --> 00:01:47.359 
just gonna keep them default and of
course<00:01:46.289> some<00:01:46.500> other<00:01:46.560> things<00:01:46.890> you<00:01:46.979> might<00:01:47.130> see

00:01:47.359 --> 00:01:47.369 
course some other things you might see

00:01:47.369 --> 00:01:50.600 
course some other things you might see
on<00:01:47.399> your<00:01:47.729> main<00:01:48.240> game<00:01:48.539> page<00:01:48.840> and<00:01:49.520> we'll<00:01:50.520> go

00:01:50.600 --> 00:01:50.610 
on your main game page and we'll go

00:01:50.610 --> 00:01:53.240 
on your main game page and we'll go
ahead<00:01:50.700> and<00:01:50.880> hit<00:01:51.000> like<00:01:51.270> as<00:01:52.170> you<00:01:52.799> can<00:01:52.890> see<00:01:53.100> the

00:01:53.240 --> 00:01:53.250 
ahead and hit like as you can see the

00:01:53.250 --> 00:01:54.740 
ahead and hit like as you can see the
title<00:01:53.549> scream<00:01:53.789> of<00:01:53.880> the<00:01:53.939> game<00:01:54.149> is<00:01:54.390> just<00:01:54.420> the

00:01:54.740 --> 00:01:54.750 
title scream of the game is just the

00:01:54.750 --> 00:01:56.029 
title scream of the game is just the
same<00:01:54.990> as<00:01:55.170> you<00:01:55.320> would<00:01:55.409> find<00:01:55.590> on<00:01:55.799> a<00:01:55.860> regular

00:01:56.029 --> 00:01:56.039 
same as you would find on a regular

00:01:56.039 --> 00:01:58.580 
same as you would find on a regular
computer<00:01:56.659> so<00:01:57.659> we're<00:01:57.990> gonna<00:01:58.079> go<00:01:58.289> ahead<00:01:58.500> and

00:01:58.580 --> 00:01:58.590 
computer so we're gonna go ahead and

00:01:58.590 --> 00:02:03.340 
computer so we're gonna go ahead and
start<00:01:58.770> a<00:01:58.829> new<00:01:58.860> game<00:02:00.679> using<00:02:01.679> the<00:02:01.829> triggers<00:02:02.369> as

00:02:03.340 --> 00:02:03.350 
start a new game using the triggers as

00:02:03.350 --> 00:02:05.749 
start a new game using the triggers as
the<00:02:04.350> mouse<00:02:04.560> keys<00:02:04.979> because<00:02:05.280> that's<00:02:05.490> what<00:02:05.610> it's

00:02:05.749 --> 00:02:05.759 
the mouse keys because that's what it's

00:02:05.759 --> 00:02:07.819 
the mouse keys because that's what it's
bound<00:02:05.970> to<00:02:06.090> so<00:02:06.869> I<00:02:06.960> can<00:02:07.020> use<00:02:07.259> the<00:02:07.409> triggers<00:02:07.710> to

00:02:07.819 --> 00:02:07.829 
bound to so I can use the triggers to

00:02:07.829 --> 00:02:10.940 
bound to so I can use the triggers to
fire<00:02:07.860> my<00:02:08.130> portals<00:02:09.289> start<00:02:10.289> a<00:02:10.319> new<00:02:10.440> game<00:02:10.619> here<00:02:10.830> on

00:02:10.940 --> 00:02:10.950 
fire my portals start a new game here on

00:02:10.950 --> 00:02:16.970 
fire my portals start a new game here on
test<00:02:11.190> chamber<00:02:11.489> 13<00:02:13.880> alright<00:02:14.880> so<00:02:15.620> let's<00:02:16.620> get<00:02:16.799> to

00:02:16.970 --> 00:02:16.980 
test chamber 13 alright so let's get to

00:02:16.980 --> 00:02:25.580 
test chamber 13 alright so let's get to
moving

00:02:25.580 --> 00:02:25.590 

00:02:25.590 --> 00:02:27.530 

I'm<00:02:26.040> clicking<00:02:26.430> down<00:02:26.610> the<00:02:26.760> right<00:02:26.940> pad<00:02:27.180> to<00:02:27.390> pick

00:02:27.530 --> 00:02:27.540 
I'm clicking down the right pad to pick

00:02:27.540 --> 00:02:29.540 
I'm clicking down the right pad to pick
up<00:02:27.690> things<00:02:27.930> and<00:02:28.379> clicking<00:02:29.129> down<00:02:29.280> the<00:02:29.370> left

00:02:29.540 --> 00:02:29.550 
up things and clicking down the left

00:02:29.550 --> 00:02:45.920 
up things and clicking down the left
hands<00:02:29.790> jump

00:02:45.920 --> 00:02:45.930 

00:02:45.930 --> 00:02:50.910 

nailed<00:02:46.590> it

00:02:50.910 --> 00:02:50.920 

00:02:50.920 --> 00:03:03.500 

No

00:03:03.500 --> 00:03:03.510 

00:03:03.510 --> 00:03:12.050 

down

00:03:12.050 --> 00:03:12.060 

00:03:12.060 --> 00:03:15.020 

so<00:03:12.720> as<00:03:13.050> you<00:03:13.170> can<00:03:13.260> probably<00:03:13.319> tell<00:03:14.030> actual

00:03:15.020 --> 00:03:15.030 
so as you can probably tell actual

00:03:15.030 --> 00:03:16.970 
so as you can probably tell actual
movement<00:03:15.450> can<00:03:15.750> be<00:03:15.780> pretty<00:03:16.170> clunky<00:03:16.470> at<00:03:16.709> times

00:03:16.970 --> 00:03:16.980 
movement can be pretty clunky at times

00:03:16.980 --> 00:03:19.460 
movement can be pretty clunky at times
looking<00:03:17.910> feels<00:03:18.180> pretty<00:03:18.510> natural<00:03:18.959> though<00:03:19.110> all

00:03:19.460 --> 00:03:19.470 
looking feels pretty natural though all

00:03:19.470 --> 00:03:21.710 
looking feels pretty natural though all
things<00:03:19.709> considered<00:03:20.390> just<00:03:21.390> takes<00:03:21.540> a<00:03:21.630> little

00:03:21.710 --> 00:03:21.720 
things considered just takes a little

00:03:21.720 --> 00:03:23.260 
things considered just takes a little
bit<00:03:21.840> of<00:03:22.020> getting<00:03:22.140> used<00:03:22.230> to

00:03:23.260 --> 00:03:23.270 
bit of getting used to

00:03:23.270 --> 00:03:26.620 
bit of getting used to
let's<00:03:24.270> see<00:03:24.480> if<00:03:24.600> I<00:03:24.720> can<00:03:24.900> do<00:03:25.080> this<00:03:25.260> the<00:03:25.590> quick<00:03:25.830> way

00:03:26.620 --> 00:03:26.630 
let's see if I can do this the quick way

00:03:26.630 --> 00:03:28.940 
let's see if I can do this the quick way
and<00:03:27.630> then<00:03:27.780> we'll<00:03:27.959> do<00:03:28.050> it<00:03:28.170> the<00:03:28.260> real<00:03:28.440> way<00:03:28.470> just

00:03:28.940 --> 00:03:28.950 
and then we'll do it the real way just

00:03:28.950 --> 00:03:34.100 
and then we'll do it the real way just
for<00:03:29.130> the<00:03:29.220> test<00:03:29.959> all<00:03:30.959> right<00:03:32.330> so<00:03:33.330> I've<00:03:33.930> had

00:03:34.100 --> 00:03:34.110 
for the test all right so I've had

00:03:34.110 --> 00:03:37.760 
for the test all right so I've had
trouble<00:03:34.500> before<00:03:34.680> flying<00:03:35.220> that<00:03:35.580> air<00:03:36.200> in<00:03:37.200> Portal

00:03:37.760 --> 00:03:37.770 
trouble before flying that air in Portal

00:03:37.770 --> 00:03:39.979 
trouble before flying that air in Portal
with<00:03:38.100> this<00:03:38.310> controller<00:03:38.730> but<00:03:39.270> doesn't<00:03:39.780> seem

00:03:39.979 --> 00:03:39.989 
with this controller but doesn't seem

00:03:39.989 --> 00:03:42.830 
with this controller but doesn't seem
like<00:03:40.230> that's<00:03:40.790> too<00:03:41.790> much<00:03:42.000> of<00:03:42.150> a<00:03:42.239> big<00:03:42.450> deal<00:03:42.480> right

00:03:42.830 --> 00:03:42.840 
like that's too much of a big deal right

00:03:42.840 --> 00:03:46.580 
like that's too much of a big deal right
now<00:03:42.900> so<00:03:43.580> let's<00:03:44.580> go<00:03:44.760> back<00:03:44.970> over<00:03:45.000> this<00:03:45.390> way<00:03:45.690> and

00:03:46.580 --> 00:03:46.590 
now so let's go back over this way and

00:03:46.590 --> 00:04:06.580 
now so let's go back over this way and
get<00:03:46.709> the<00:03:46.890> cube<00:03:47.190> that<00:03:47.340> we<00:03:47.459> need

00:04:06.580 --> 00:04:06.590 

00:04:06.590 --> 00:04:09.410 

those<00:04:07.590> quick<00:04:07.890> midair<00:04:08.280> looks<00:04:08.550> can<00:04:08.970> be<00:04:09.000> pretty

00:04:09.410 --> 00:04:09.420 
those quick midair looks can be pretty

00:04:09.420 --> 00:04:12.560 
those quick midair looks can be pretty
difficult<00:04:09.690> which<00:04:10.650> can<00:04:10.890> get<00:04:11.010> frustrating<00:04:11.580> but

00:04:12.560 --> 00:04:12.570 
difficult which can get frustrating but

00:04:12.570 --> 00:04:14.090 
difficult which can get frustrating but
again<00:04:12.870> that's<00:04:13.020> just<00:04:13.230> a<00:04:13.410> thing<00:04:13.770> you<00:04:13.800> have<00:04:13.980> to

00:04:14.090 --> 00:04:14.100 
again that's just a thing you have to

00:04:14.100 --> 00:04:21.470 
again that's just a thing you have to
get<00:04:14.220> used<00:04:14.370> to

00:04:21.470 --> 00:04:21.480 

00:04:21.480 --> 00:05:09.900 

why<00:04:22.050> walk<00:04:22.290> when<00:04:22.350> you<00:04:22.620> can<00:04:22.650> portal

00:05:09.900 --> 00:05:09.910 

00:05:09.910 --> 00:05:11.790 

so<00:05:10.480> precision<00:05:10.990> aiming<00:05:11.110> works<00:05:11.470> pretty<00:05:11.680> well

00:05:11.790 --> 00:05:11.800 
so precision aiming works pretty well

00:05:11.800 --> 00:05:17.880 
so precision aiming works pretty well
obviously<00:05:14.490> that's<00:05:15.490> fairly<00:05:16.180> nice<00:05:16.620> also<00:05:17.620> I<00:05:17.650> like

00:05:17.880 --> 00:05:17.890 
obviously that's fairly nice also I like

00:05:17.890 --> 00:05:19.950 
obviously that's fairly nice also I like
that<00:05:18.070> they<00:05:18.190> bound<00:05:18.430> the<00:05:18.820> Crouch<00:05:19.150> button<00:05:19.360> to<00:05:19.720> one

00:05:19.950 --> 00:05:19.960 
that they bound the Crouch button to one

00:05:19.960 --> 00:05:28.600 
that they bound the Crouch button to one
of<00:05:20.080> the<00:05:20.230> paddles

00:05:28.600 --> 00:05:28.610 

00:05:28.610 --> 00:05:30.100 

all<00:05:29.120> right<00:05:29.270> this<00:05:29.449> one<00:05:29.629> should<00:05:29.930> be<00:05:29.960> pretty

00:05:30.100 --> 00:05:30.110 
all right this one should be pretty

00:05:30.110 --> 00:05:32.469 
all right this one should be pretty
tricky<00:05:30.530> since<00:05:31.159> it's<00:05:31.310> got<00:05:31.430> a<00:05:31.460> lot<00:05:31.639> of<00:05:31.669> portal

00:05:32.469 --> 00:05:32.479 
tricky since it's got a lot of portal

00:05:32.479 --> 00:05:42.709 
tricky since it's got a lot of portal
flings

00:05:42.709 --> 00:05:42.719 

00:05:42.719 --> 00:05:45.229 

snap<00:05:43.499> movements<00:05:44.069> are<00:05:44.189> definitely<00:05:44.789> more

00:05:45.229 --> 00:05:45.239 
snap movements are definitely more

00:05:45.239 --> 00:05:58.870 
snap movements are definitely more
difficult<00:05:47.869> with<00:05:48.869> this<00:05:49.080> controller

00:05:58.870 --> 00:05:58.880 

00:05:58.880 --> 00:06:01.280 

now<00:05:59.880> keep<00:06:00.060> in<00:06:00.180> mind<00:06:00.360> these<00:06:00.510> are<00:06:00.570> all<00:06:00.810> test

00:06:01.280 --> 00:06:01.290 
now keep in mind these are all test

00:06:01.290 --> 00:06:02.570 
now keep in mind these are all test
chambers<00:06:01.590> I've<00:06:01.740> played<00:06:01.949> a<00:06:01.979> hundreds<00:06:02.310> of<00:06:02.400> times

00:06:02.570 --> 00:06:02.580 
chambers I've played a hundreds of times

00:06:02.580 --> 00:06:07.010 
chambers I've played a hundreds of times
before<00:06:03.110> and<00:06:04.110> I've<00:06:04.590> probably<00:06:04.919> gotten<00:06:06.020> about

00:06:07.010 --> 00:06:07.020 
before and I've probably gotten about

00:06:07.020 --> 00:06:09.200 
before and I've probably gotten about
five<00:06:07.530> or<00:06:07.740> so<00:06:07.919> playthroughs<00:06:08.460> through<00:06:08.699> with<00:06:08.970> the

00:06:09.200 --> 00:06:09.210 
five or so playthroughs through with the

00:06:09.210 --> 00:06:12.379 
five or so playthroughs through with the
steam<00:06:09.510> controller<00:06:10.010> already<00:06:11.010> in<00:06:11.850> just<00:06:12.150> making

00:06:12.379 --> 00:06:12.389 
steam controller already in just making

00:06:12.389 --> 00:06:16.520 
steam controller already in just making
this<00:06:12.570> video<00:06:12.810> so<00:06:14.660> there<00:06:15.660> is<00:06:15.810> definitely<00:06:16.500> a

00:06:16.520 --> 00:06:16.530 
this video so there is definitely a

00:06:16.530 --> 00:06:17.840 
this video so there is definitely a
learning<00:06:16.710> curve<00:06:17.010> I<00:06:17.160> wasn't<00:06:17.430> going<00:06:17.669> through

00:06:17.840 --> 00:06:17.850 
learning curve I wasn't going through

00:06:17.850 --> 00:06:20.900 
learning curve I wasn't going through
this<00:06:18.090> smoothly<00:06:18.389> even<00:06:19.520> when<00:06:20.520> I<00:06:20.550> went<00:06:20.850> through

00:06:20.900 --> 00:06:20.910 
this smoothly even when I went through

00:06:20.910 --> 00:06:28.189 
this smoothly even when I went through
the<00:06:21.120> first<00:06:21.300> few<00:06:21.600> times<00:06:25.340> yeah<00:06:26.870> overall<00:06:27.870> though

00:06:28.189 --> 00:06:28.199 
the first few times yeah overall though

00:06:28.199 --> 00:06:30.620 
the first few times yeah overall though
the<00:06:28.889> controller<00:06:29.490> feels<00:06:29.789> pretty<00:06:30.090> comfortable

00:06:30.620 --> 00:06:30.630 
the controller feels pretty comfortable

00:06:30.630 --> 00:06:33.140 
the controller feels pretty comfortable
I'm<00:06:31.350> not<00:06:31.530> having<00:06:31.919> any<00:06:32.100> problems<00:06:32.490> finding

00:06:33.140 --> 00:06:33.150 
I'm not having any problems finding

00:06:33.150 --> 00:06:39.320 
I'm not having any problems finding
buttons<00:06:33.510> or<00:06:34.280> any<00:06:35.280> uncomfortable<00:06:36.240> issues<00:06:38.330> my

00:06:39.320 --> 00:06:39.330 
buttons or any uncomfortable issues my

00:06:39.330 --> 00:06:42.950 
buttons or any uncomfortable issues my
thumb's<00:06:39.600> feel<00:06:39.919> fairly<00:06:40.919> natural<00:06:41.930> with<00:06:42.930> the

00:06:42.950 --> 00:06:42.960 
thumb's feel fairly natural with the

00:06:42.960 --> 00:06:45.110 
thumb's feel fairly natural with the
touch<00:06:43.260> pads<00:06:43.560> it's<00:06:44.430> just<00:06:44.550> a<00:06:44.639> matter<00:06:44.820> of<00:06:44.940> getting

00:06:45.110 --> 00:06:45.120 
touch pads it's just a matter of getting

00:06:45.120 --> 00:06:47.120 
touch pads it's just a matter of getting
used<00:06:45.449> to<00:06:45.600> how<00:06:45.750> the<00:06:45.810> touch<00:06:46.080> pads<00:06:46.410> react<00:06:46.770> to

00:06:47.120 --> 00:06:47.130 
used to how the touch pads react to

00:06:47.130 --> 00:06:50.659 
used to how the touch pads react to
motion<00:06:48.410> so<00:06:49.410> overall<00:06:49.830> I'm<00:06:49.979> pretty<00:06:50.100> satisfied

00:06:50.659 --> 00:06:50.669 
motion so overall I'm pretty satisfied

00:06:50.669 --> 00:06:51.710 
motion so overall I'm pretty satisfied
with<00:06:50.699> the<00:06:50.850> steam<00:06:51.060> controller<00:06:51.330> it's

00:06:51.710 --> 00:06:51.720 
with the steam controller it's

00:06:51.720 --> 00:06:53.360 
with the steam controller it's
definitely<00:06:52.080> still<00:06:52.260> in<00:06:52.410> beta<00:06:52.560> they<00:06:53.160> got<00:06:53.280> to

00:06:53.360 --> 00:06:53.370 
definitely still in beta they got to

00:06:53.370 --> 00:06:54.620 
definitely still in beta they got to
work<00:06:53.490> out<00:06:53.610> the<00:06:53.729> kinks<00:06:53.970> like<00:06:54.090> the<00:06:54.300> drifting

00:06:54.620 --> 00:06:54.630 
work out the kinks like the drifting

00:06:54.630 --> 00:06:56.390 
work out the kinks like the drifting
track<00:06:54.870> pads<00:06:55.139> but<00:06:55.560> I'm<00:06:55.650> really<00:06:55.800> excited<00:06:56.130> about

00:06:56.390 --> 00:06:56.400 
track pads but I'm really excited about

00:06:56.400 --> 00:06:58.520 
track pads but I'm really excited about
the<00:06:56.669> touchscreen<00:06:57.030> and<00:06:57.449> I<00:06:57.900> love<00:06:58.139> the<00:06:58.289> paddle

00:06:58.520 --> 00:06:58.530 
the touchscreen and I love the paddle

00:06:58.530 --> 00:06:59.480 
the touchscreen and I love the paddle
shifters<00:06:58.800> on<00:06:58.949> the<00:06:58.979> back

00:06:59.480 --> 00:06:59.490 
shifters on the back

00:06:59.490 --> 00:07:01.100 
shifters on the back
I<00:06:59.520> think<00:07:00.030> the<00:07:00.120> touch<00:07:00.300> pads<00:07:00.539> are<00:07:00.780> just<00:07:00.930> gonna<00:07:01.020> be

00:07:01.100 --> 00:07:01.110 
I think the touch pads are just gonna be

00:07:01.110 --> 00:07:03.650 
I think the touch pads are just gonna be
a<00:07:01.260> game-changer<00:07:01.740> overall<00:07:02.610> it's<00:07:03.180> got<00:07:03.330> a<00:07:03.360> pretty

00:07:03.650 --> 00:07:03.660 
a game-changer overall it's got a pretty

00:07:03.660 --> 00:07:05.659 
a game-changer overall it's got a pretty
steep<00:07:03.900> learning<00:07:04.139> curve<00:07:04.560> but<00:07:04.800> you<00:07:05.160> know<00:07:05.280> it's

00:07:05.659 --> 00:07:05.669 
steep learning curve but you know it's

00:07:05.669 --> 00:07:07.040 
steep learning curve but you know it's
cutting<00:07:05.940> something<00:07:06.450> new<00:07:06.630> someone's

00:07:07.040 --> 00:07:07.050 
cutting something new someone's

00:07:07.050 --> 00:07:09.379 
cutting something new someone's
innovating<00:07:07.500> that's<00:07:07.680> to<00:07:07.800> be<00:07:07.889> expected<00:07:08.389> I'm

00:07:09.379 --> 00:07:09.389 
innovating that's to be expected I'm

00:07:09.389 --> 00:07:11.330 
innovating that's to be expected I'm
just<00:07:09.630> kinda<00:07:09.960> interested<00:07:10.289> in<00:07:10.349> seeing<00:07:10.620> when<00:07:11.220> I'm

00:07:11.330 --> 00:07:11.340 
just kinda interested in seeing when I'm
