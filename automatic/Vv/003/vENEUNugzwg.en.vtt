00:02:14.760 --> 00:02:14.770 
and oh look at this this return okay

00:02:14.770 --> 00:02:16.200 
and oh look at this this return okay
well<00:02:15.220> it's<00:02:15.310> probably<00:02:15.520> gonna<00:02:15.670> be<00:02:15.760> synced<00:02:16.120> up

00:02:16.200 --> 00:02:16.210 
well it's probably gonna be synced up

00:02:16.210 --> 00:02:17.580 
well it's probably gonna be synced up
anyway<00:02:16.600> so<00:02:16.660> I<00:02:16.780> probably<00:02:16.990> shouldn't<00:02:17.290> even<00:02:17.320> said

00:02:17.580 --> 00:02:17.590 
anyway so I probably shouldn't even said

00:02:17.590 --> 00:02:21.750 
anyway so I probably shouldn't even said
that<00:02:17.740> but<00:02:17.920> again<00:02:19.170> I<00:02:20.170> think<00:02:21.070> it's<00:02:21.430> kind<00:02:21.610> of<00:02:21.670> a

00:02:21.750 --> 00:02:21.760 
that but again I think it's kind of a

00:02:21.760 --> 00:02:25.470 
that but again I think it's kind of a
bad<00:02:21.970> move<00:02:22.210> to<00:02:22.510> I<00:02:22.780> do<00:02:23.410> because<00:02:24.280> I<00:02:24.520> don't<00:02:25.240> think

00:02:25.470 --> 00:02:25.480 
bad move to I do because I don't think

00:02:25.480 --> 00:02:28.590 
bad move to I do because I don't think
we're<00:02:25.600> going<00:02:25.750> to<00:02:25.960> lose<00:02:26.370> you<00:02:27.370> know<00:02:27.520> just<00:02:27.820> a<00:02:28.120> ton

00:02:28.600 --> 00:02:30.720 
we're going to lose you know just a ton
of<00:02:28.630> offense<00:02:29.620> from<00:02:29.860> Graham<00:02:30.130> because<00:02:30.580> I<00:02:30.670> think

00:02:30.720 --> 00:02:30.730 
of offense from Graham because I think

00:02:30.730 --> 00:02:33.270 
of offense from Graham because I think

00:04:52.390 --> 00:04:52.400 
Saints don't have a number one receiver

00:04:52.400 --> 00:04:54.550 
Saints don't have a number one receiver
I<00:04:52.550> mean<00:04:52.729> you<00:04:52.789> could<00:04:52.910> argue<00:04:53.090> that<00:04:53.539> cooks<00:04:54.349> is<00:04:54.530> the

00:04:54.550 --> 00:04:54.560 
I mean you could argue that cooks is the

00:04:54.560 --> 00:04:57.310 
I mean you could argue that cooks is the
number<00:04:54.949> one<00:04:55.160> guy<00:04:55.400> but<00:04:55.479> we<00:04:56.479> we<00:04:56.930> don't<00:04:57.139> really

00:04:57.310 --> 00:04:57.320 
number one guy but we we don't really

00:04:57.320 --> 00:05:00.430 
number one guy but we we don't really
have<00:04:57.560> a<00:04:57.590> number<00:04:57.860> one<00:04:58.449> receiver<00:04:59.449> and<00:04:59.840> in<00:05:00.169> my

00:05:00.430 --> 00:05:00.440 
have a number one receiver and in my

00:05:00.440 --> 00:05:02.080 
have a number one receiver and in my
opinion<00:05:00.560> traditional<00:05:01.400> number<00:05:01.610> one<00:05:01.759> receiver

00:05:02.080 --> 00:05:02.090 
opinion traditional number one receiver

00:05:02.090 --> 00:05:03.460 
opinion traditional number one receiver
I<00:05:02.270> mean<00:05:02.419> Jimmy<00:05:02.660> Graham<00:05:02.930> wasn't<00:05:03.289> really<00:05:03.440> a

00:05:03.460 --> 00:05:03.470 
I mean Jimmy Graham wasn't really a

00:05:03.470 --> 00:05:05.710 
I mean Jimmy Graham wasn't really a
traditional<00:05:03.979> number<00:05:04.220> one<00:05:04.509> but<00:05:05.509> he<00:05:05.630> was

00:05:05.710 --> 00:05:05.720 
traditional number one but he was

00:05:05.720 --> 00:05:07.120 
traditional number one but he was
without<00:05:05.900> a<00:05:05.960> doubt<00:05:06.050> the<00:05:06.229> number<00:05:06.590> one<00:05:06.710> target<00:05:06.919> I

00:05:07.120 --> 00:05:07.130 
without a doubt the number one target I

00:05:07.130 --> 00:05:09.640 
without a doubt the number one target I
mean<00:05:07.280> I<00:05:07.340> guess<00:05:07.550> cooks<00:05:07.880> will<00:05:08.030> be<00:05:08.060> that<00:05:08.389> now<00:05:08.650> but

00:05:09.640 --> 00:05:09.650 
mean I guess cooks will be that now but

00:05:09.650 --> 00:05:10.749 
mean I guess cooks will be that now but
I<00:05:09.710> think<00:05:10.009> we're<00:05:10.099> going<00:05:10.250> to<00:05:10.400> draft<00:05:10.610> the

00:05:10.749 --> 00:05:10.759 
I think we're going to draft the

00:05:10.759 --> 00:05:12.580 
I think we're going to draft the
receiver<00:05:11.060> now<00:05:11.240> I<00:05:11.270> mean<00:05:11.539> we<00:05:12.050> have<00:05:12.169> two<00:05:12.349> first

00:05:12.580 --> 00:05:12.590 
receiver now I mean we have two first

00:05:12.590 --> 00:05:16.360 
receiver now I mean we have two first
round<00:05:12.830> picks<00:05:13.270> we<00:05:14.270> have<00:05:14.419> our<00:05:14.539> early<00:05:14.840> second<00:05:15.370> or

00:05:16.360 --> 00:05:16.370 
round picks we have our early second or

00:05:16.370 --> 00:05:18.279 
round picks we have our early second or
we<00:05:16.699> have<00:05:16.820> a<00:05:16.849> first<00:05:17.180> into<00:05:17.599> early<00:05:17.870> seconds<00:05:18.229> if

00:05:18.279 --> 00:05:18.289 
we have a first into early seconds if

00:05:18.289 --> 00:05:22.180 
we have a first into early seconds if
you<00:05:18.349> want<00:05:18.530> to<00:05:18.590> look<00:05:18.650> at<00:05:18.740> it<00:05:18.860> like<00:05:18.949> that<00:05:20.949> but<00:05:21.949> I

00:05:22.180 --> 00:05:22.190 
you want to look at it like that but I

00:05:22.190 --> 00:05:24.820 
you want to look at it like that but I
definitely<00:05:22.490> think<00:05:22.940> we<00:05:23.210> go<00:05:23.690> out<00:05:23.900> and<00:05:24.139> we<00:05:24.229> draft

00:05:24.820 --> 00:05:24.830 
definitely think we go out and we draft

00:05:24.830 --> 00:05:28.149 
definitely think we go out and we draft
a<00:05:25.099> receiver<00:05:25.610> now<00:05:25.940> I<00:05:26.590> hope<00:05:27.590> we<00:05:27.740> get<00:05:27.830> that<00:05:27.979> guy

00:05:28.149 --> 00:05:28.159

filmed I think the Eagles have made some

00:05:54.830 --> 00:05:59.260 
filmed I think the Eagles have made some
good<00:05:54.979> moves<00:05:55.250> I<00:05:55.490> really<00:05:55.970> do<00:05:56.180> and<00:05:56.389> I<00:05:57.289> think<00:05:58.270> the

00:05:59.260 --> 00:05:59.270 
good moves I really do and I think the

00:05:59.270 --> 00:06:01.930 
good moves I really do and I think the
Frank<00:05:59.570> Gore<00:05:59.780> might<00:05:59.990> I<00:06:00.409> don't<00:06:01.009> know<00:06:01.070> I<00:06:01.310> think

00:06:01.930 --> 00:06:01.940 
Frank Gore might I don't know I think

00:06:01.940 --> 00:06:04.060 
Frank Gore might I don't know I think
them<00:06:02.479> not<00:06:02.690> signing<00:06:03.020> gore<00:06:03.320> might<00:06:03.560> be<00:06:03.770> a<00:06:03.800> good

00:06:04.060 --> 00:06:04.070 
them not signing gore might be a good

00:06:04.070 --> 00:06:06.999 
them not signing gore might be a good
thing<00:06:04.130> I<00:06:04.639> definitely

00:06:06.999 --> 00:06:07.009 
thing I definitely

00:06:07.009 --> 00:06:09.249 
thing I definitely
I<00:06:07.300> personally<00:06:08.300> don't<00:06:08.419> think<00:06:08.599> he<00:06:08.869> was<00:06:08.990> a<00:06:09.020> great

00:06:09.249 --> 00:06:09.259 
I personally don't think he was a great

00:06:09.259 --> 00:06:10.480 
I personally don't think he was a great
fit<00:06:09.439> for<00:06:09.469> that<00:06:09.740> often<00:06:10.039> so<00:06:10.069> I<00:06:10.189> know<00:06:10.309> there<00:06:10.460> was

00:06:10.480 --> 00:06:10.490 
fit for that often so I know there was

00:06:10.490 --> 00:06:13.809 
fit for that often so I know there was
some<00:06:10.610> stat<00:06:11.119> out<00:06:11.360> there<00:06:11.629> the<00:06:12.469> gore<00:06:12.979> and<00:06:13.279> shotgun

00:06:13.809 --> 00:06:13.819 
some stat out there the gore and shotgun

00:06:13.819 --> 00:06:16.899 
some stat out there the gore and shotgun
runs<00:06:14.119> is<00:06:14.419> 5<00:06:14.659> plus<00:06:14.689> yards<00:06:15.229> a<00:06:15.499> carry<00:06:15.710> but<00:06:16.099> I<00:06:16.399> think

00:06:16.899 --> 00:06:16.909 
runs is 5 plus yards a carry but I think

00:06:16.909 --> 00:06:18.579 
runs is 5 plus yards a carry but I think
Gore<00:06:17.119> if<00:06:17.180> it's<00:06:17.389> the<00:06:17.509> colts<00:06:17.869> offense<00:06:17.960> a<00:06:18.409> lot

00:06:18.579 --> 00:06:18.589 
Gore if it's the colts offense a lot

00:06:18.589 --> 00:06:20.409 
Gore if it's the colts offense a lot
better<00:06:18.740> i<00:06:18.889> think<00:06:19.129> that's<00:06:19.309> it<00:06:19.430> that's<00:06:19.939> a<00:06:20.119> great

00:06:20.409 --> 00:06:20.419 
better i think that's it that's a great

00:06:20.419 --> 00:06:23.230 
better i think that's it that's a great
fit<00:06:20.779> for<00:06:20.990> both<00:06:21.379> parties<00:06:21.649> involved<00:06:22.339> the<00:06:22.999> crazy

00:06:23.230 --> 00:06:23.240 
fit for both parties involved the crazy

00:06:23.240 --> 00:06:25.600 
fit for both parties involved the crazy
