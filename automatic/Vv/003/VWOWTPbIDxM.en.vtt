00:00:19.400 --> 00:00:19.410 
things that gained our interest was a

00:00:19.410 --> 00:00:23.300 
things that gained our interest was a
process<00:00:20.250> called<00:00:20.550> biochar<00:00:21.359> and<00:00:22.100> that's<00:00:23.100> what

00:00:23.300 --> 00:00:23.310 
process called biochar and that's what

00:00:23.310 --> 00:00:26.300 
process called biochar and that's what
brings<00:00:23.490> us<00:00:23.699> here<00:00:23.760> to<00:00:24.180> the<00:00:24.300> farm<00:00:24.800> and<00:00:25.800> has

00:00:26.300 --> 00:00:26.310 
brings us here to the farm and has

would<00:00:51.469> know<00:00:52.469> you<00:00:52.530> can<00:00:52.890> biomass<00:00:53.840> anything

00:00:54.830 --> 00:00:54.840 
would know you can biomass anything

00:00:54.840 --> 00:00:57.529 
would know you can biomass anything
that's<00:00:55.110> a<00:00:55.289> natural<00:00:55.530> product<00:00:56.070> so<00:00:56.430> the<00:00:57.000> grass<00:00:57.270> is

00:00:57.529 --> 00:00:57.539 
that's a natural product so the grass is

00:00:57.539 --> 00:01:00.020 
that's a natural product so the grass is
standing<00:00:57.960> on<00:00:58.079> the<00:00:58.949> trees<00:00:59.250> that<00:00:59.579> are<00:00:59.609> over

00:01:00.020 --> 00:01:00.030 
standing on the trees that are over

00:01:00.030 --> 00:01:01.700 
standing on the trees that are over
there<00:01:00.180> the<00:01:00.359> leaps<00:01:00.600> that<00:01:00.840> fall<00:01:01.109> from<00:01:01.140> the<00:01:01.469> trees

00:01:01.700 --> 00:01:01.710

00:01:29.109 --> 00:01:29.119 
amazing how much how much biomass that

00:01:29.119 --> 00:01:35.510 
amazing how much how much biomass that
we<00:01:30.119> as<00:01:31.220> humans<00:01:32.220> produce<00:01:32.549> or<00:01:33.979> just<00:01:34.979> discard

00:01:35.510 --> 00:01:35.520 
we as humans produce or just discard

00:01:35.520 --> 00:01:37.969 
we as humans produce or just discard
after<00:01:36.119> we're<00:01:36.270> done<00:01:36.420> using<00:01:36.720> them<00:01:36.930> and<00:01:37.229> there's

00:01:37.969 --> 00:01:37.979 
after we're done using them and there's

00:01:37.979 --> 00:01:42.080 
after we're done using them and there's
plenty<00:01:38.460> of<00:01:38.490> use<00:01:38.820> for<00:01:39.600> that<00:01:39.900> biomass<00:01:40.850> and<00:01:41.850> this

00:01:42.080 --> 00:01:42.090 
plenty of use for that biomass and this

00:01:42.090 --> 00:01:45.289 
plenty of use for that biomass and this
is<00:01:42.240> just<00:01:42.420> one<00:01:42.540> process<00:01:43.350> that<00:01:43.939> we<00:01:44.939> can<00:01:45.119> take

00:01:45.289 --> 00:01:45.299 
is just one process that we can take

00:01:45.299 --> 00:01:47.030 
is just one process that we can take
advantage<00:01:45.420> of<00:01:45.899> by<00:01:46.290> breaking<00:01:46.710> it<00:01:46.799> down<00:01:46.829> into

00:01:47.030 --> 00:01:47.040 
advantage of by breaking it down into

00:01:47.040 --> 00:01:47.890 
advantage of by breaking it down into
the

00:01:47.890 --> 00:01:47.900 
the

00:01:47.900 --> 00:01:51.890 
the
so<00:01:48.900> what<00:01:49.050> got<00:01:49.200> you<00:01:49.260> into<00:01:49.740> it<00:01:50.900> what's

00:01:51.890 --> 00:01:51.900 
so what got you into it what's

00:01:51.900 --> 00:01:56.750 
so what got you into it what's
interesting<00:01:52.080> is<00:01:53.240> I<00:01:54.240> was<00:01:54.840> watching<00:01:55.550> the<00:01:56.550> green

00:01:56.750 --> 00:01:56.760 
interesting is I was watching the green

00:01:56.760 --> 00:01:59.690 
interesting is I was watching the green
channel<00:01:57.060> or<00:01:57.270> something<00:01:57.360> like<00:01:57.690> that<00:01:57.750> and<00:01:58.700> they

00:01:59.690 --> 00:01:59.700 
channel or something like that and they

00:01:59.700 --> 00:02:02.540 
channel or something like that and they
were<00:01:59.760> talking<00:02:00.240> about<00:02:00.740> different<00:02:01.740> things<00:02:01.979> that

00:02:02.540 --> 00:02:02.550 
were talking about different things that

00:02:02.550 --> 00:02:04.640 
were talking about different things that
we<00:02:03.150> have<00:02:03.330> to<00:02:03.479> think<00:02:03.660> about<00:02:03.869> today<00:02:04.200> that's

00:02:04.640 --> 00:02:04.650 
we have to think about today that's

00:02:04.650 --> 00:02:07.580 
we have to think about today that's
going<00:02:04.830> to<00:02:04.890> sustain<00:02:05.369> us<00:02:05.400> further<00:02:06.080> 20<00:02:07.080> 30<00:02:07.290> years

00:02:07.580 --> 00:02:07.590 
going to sustain us further 20 30 years

00:02:07.590 --> 00:02:10.070 
going to sustain us further 20 30 years
from<00:02:07.710> now<00:02:07.800> and<00:02:08.190> they<00:02:08.670> were<00:02:08.820> going<00:02:09.060> through<00:02:09.270> all

00:02:10.070 --> 00:02:10.080 
from now and they were going through all

00:02:10.080 --> 00:02:12.080 
from now and they were going through all
the<00:02:10.500> different<00:02:10.619> things<00:02:10.890> that<00:02:11.220> potentially

00:02:12.080 --> 00:02:12.090 
the different things that potentially

00:02:12.090 --> 00:02:16.490 
the different things that potentially
could<00:02:12.510> be<00:02:12.920> useful<00:02:13.920> and<00:02:14.690> they<00:02:15.690> narrowed<00:02:16.410> it

00:02:16.490 --> 00:02:16.500 
could be useful and they narrowed it

00:02:16.500 --> 00:02:18.530 
could be useful and they narrowed it
down<00:02:16.530> to<00:02:16.709> this<00:02:17.220> you<00:02:17.550> know<00:02:17.670> one<00:02:18.030> item<00:02:18.510> that's

00:02:18.530 --> 00:02:18.540 
down to this you know one item that's

00:02:18.540 --> 00:02:20.780 
down to this you know one item that's
going<00:02:18.900> to<00:02:18.959> be<00:02:19.110> the<00:02:19.290> most<00:02:19.890> productive<00:02:20.340> for<00:02:20.760> us

00:02:20.780 --> 00:02:20.790 
going to be the most productive for us

00:02:20.790 --> 00:02:24.020 
going to be the most productive for us
as<00:02:21.030> citizens<00:02:21.870> and<00:02:22.860> you<00:02:23.220> know<00:02:23.310> they<00:02:23.489> did<00:02:23.670> solar

00:02:24.020 --> 00:02:24.030 
as citizens and you know they did solar

00:02:24.030 --> 00:02:28.580 
as citizens and you know they did solar
energy<00:02:24.600> and<00:02:24.630> wind<00:02:24.840> energy<00:02:25.170> and<00:02:27.410> one<00:02:28.410> of<00:02:28.500> the

00:02:28.580 --> 00:02:28.590 
energy and wind energy and one of the

00:02:28.590 --> 00:02:32.270 
energy and wind energy and one of the
things<00:02:28.620> they<00:02:28.980> review<00:02:29.340> was<00:02:29.519> biochar<00:02:30.180> and<00:02:31.280> for

00:02:32.270 --> 00:02:32.280 
things they review was biochar and for

00:02:32.280 --> 00:02:34.790 
things they review was biochar and for
whatever<00:02:32.459> reason<00:02:32.870> it<00:02:33.870> caught<00:02:34.260> my<00:02:34.500> heart

00:02:34.790 --> 00:02:34.800 
whatever reason it caught my heart

00:02:34.800 --> 00:02:39.380 
whatever reason it caught my heart
watching<00:02:35.580> that<00:02:36.110> watching<00:02:37.110> that<00:02:38.180> section<00:02:39.180> and

00:02:39.380 --> 00:02:39.390 
watching that watching that section and

00:02:39.390 --> 00:02:45.050 
watching that watching that section and
so<00:02:40.230> I<00:02:41.209> watched<00:02:42.209> what<00:02:42.720> it<00:02:42.840> was<00:02:43.050> and<00:02:43.530> then<00:02:44.310> after

00:02:45.050 --> 00:02:45.060 
so I watched what it was and then after

00:02:45.060 --> 00:02:48.830 
so I watched what it was and then after
I<00:02:45.150> saw<00:02:45.450> them<00:02:45.860> show<00:02:46.860> it<00:02:47.100> I<00:02:47.340> went<00:02:48.330> and<00:02:48.480> did<00:02:48.600> some

00:02:48.830 --> 00:02:48.840 
I saw them show it I went and did some

00:02:48.840 --> 00:02:52.580 
I saw them show it I went and did some
investigation<00:02:49.640> and<00:02:50.640> did<00:02:51.209> some<00:02:51.480> research<00:02:52.170> on

00:02:52.580 --> 00:02:52.590 
investigation and did some research on

00:02:52.590 --> 00:02:54.259 
investigation and did some research on
the<00:02:52.709> internet<00:02:53.160> it's<00:02:53.519> very<00:02:53.700> simple<00:02:54.060> you<00:02:54.180> just

00:02:54.259 --> 00:02:54.269 
the internet it's very simple you just

00:02:54.269 --> 00:02:57.770 
the internet it's very simple you just
get<00:02:54.570> online<00:02:54.769> type<00:02:55.769> in<00:02:55.920> bio<00:02:56.220> char<00:02:56.579> and<00:02:56.880> you're

00:02:57.770 --> 00:02:57.780 
get online type in bio char and you're

00:02:57.780 --> 00:02:59.390 
get online type in bio char and you're
going<00:02:57.930> to<00:02:57.989> see<00:02:58.260> all<00:02:58.500> different<00:02:58.799> types<00:02:59.220> of

00:02:59.390 --> 00:02:59.400 
going to see all different types of

00:02:59.400 --> 00:03:02.780 
going to see all different types of
videos<00:02:59.760> of<00:03:00.120> how<00:03:00.720> to<00:03:00.780> biochar<00:03:01.670> obviously<00:03:02.670> we're

00:03:02.780 --> 00:03:02.790 
videos of how to biochar obviously we're

00:03:02.790 --> 00:03:08.539 
videos of how to biochar obviously we're
going<00:03:02.910> to<00:03:02.970> do<00:03:03.090> that<00:03:03.239> process<00:03:03.720> today<00:03:05.239> now<00:03:07.549> we

00:03:08.539 --> 00:03:08.549 
going to do that process today now we

00:03:08.549 --> 00:03:12.170 
going to do that process today now we
have<00:03:08.790> a<00:03:09.209> lot<00:03:09.930> of<00:03:09.959> biomass<00:03:10.739> biomass<00:03:11.610> is

00:03:12.170 --> 00:03:12.180 
have a lot of biomass biomass is

00:03:12.180 --> 00:03:16.610 
have a lot of biomass biomass is
anything<00:03:12.810> that<00:03:12.870> is<00:03:13.430> biodegradable<00:03:15.620> would

00:03:16.610 --> 00:03:16.620 
anything that is biodegradable would

00:03:16.620 --> 00:03:21.860 
anything that is biodegradable would
leaps<00:03:17.900> fruits<00:03:18.900> vegetables<00:03:20.329> you<00:03:21.329> take<00:03:21.540> a<00:03:21.570> piece

00:03:21.860 --> 00:03:21.870 
leaps fruits vegetables you take a piece

00:03:21.870 --> 00:03:25.000 
leaps fruits vegetables you take a piece
of<00:03:21.930> wood<00:03:22.260> like<00:03:22.320> this<00:03:22.530> and<00:03:23.190> you're<00:03:23.880> able<00:03:24.090> to

00:03:25.000 --> 00:03:25.010 
of wood like this and you're able to

00:03:25.010 --> 00:03:29.150 
of wood like this and you're able to
turn<00:03:26.010> it<00:03:26.220> into<00:03:26.570> biochar<00:03:27.739> you<00:03:28.739> can<00:03:28.920> see<00:03:29.130> that

00:03:29.150 --> 00:03:29.160 
turn it into biochar you can see that

00:03:29.160 --> 00:03:31.729 
turn it into biochar you can see that
this<00:03:29.459> has<00:03:29.670> been<00:03:30.000> charred<00:03:30.450> will<00:03:31.320> show<00:03:31.500> you<00:03:31.560> how

00:03:31.729 --> 00:03:31.739 
this has been charred will show you how

00:03:31.739 --> 00:03:35.690 
this has been charred will show you how
the<00:03:31.799> process<00:03:32.700> works<00:03:33.680> but<00:03:34.680> this<00:03:35.130> was<00:03:35.400> a<00:03:35.430> piece

00:03:35.690 --> 00:03:35.700 
the process works but this was a piece

00:03:35.700 --> 00:03:38.030 
the process works but this was a piece
of<00:03:35.730> wood<00:03:36.000> just<00:03:36.239> like<00:03:36.390> this<00:03:36.660> and<00:03:36.989> you<00:03:37.650> can<00:03:37.680> see

00:03:38.030 --> 00:03:38.040 
of wood just like this and you can see

00:03:38.040 --> 00:03:40.610 
of wood just like this and you can see
it's<00:03:38.160> very<00:03:38.340> fragile<00:03:38.670> now<00:03:39.150> and<00:03:39.510> it<00:03:40.079> looks<00:03:40.290> like

00:03:40.610 --> 00:03:40.620 
it's very fragile now and it looks like

00:03:40.620 --> 00:03:44.300 
it's very fragile now and it looks like
it's<00:03:41.010> all<00:03:41.340> burnt<00:03:41.670> in<00:03:42.440> reality<00:03:43.440> it's<00:03:43.739> just<00:03:43.890> bio

00:03:44.300 --> 00:03:44.310 
it's all burnt in reality it's just bio

00:03:44.310 --> 00:03:47.840 
it's all burnt in reality it's just bio
charred<00:03:44.790> you<00:03:45.630> can<00:03:45.780> see<00:03:46.079> the<00:03:47.070> fine<00:03:47.340> dust<00:03:47.609> it

00:03:47.840 --> 00:03:47.850 
charred you can see the fine dust it

00:03:47.850 --> 00:03:50.300 
charred you can see the fine dust it
turns<00:03:48.060> into<00:03:48.470> and<00:03:49.470> what<00:03:49.650> you<00:03:49.739> do<00:03:49.920> is<00:03:49.950> you<00:03:50.280> take

00:03:50.300 --> 00:03:50.310 
turns into and what you do is you take

00:03:50.310 --> 00:03:53.990 
turns into and what you do is you take
this<00:03:51.000> biochar<00:03:51.840> you<00:03:52.560> mix<00:03:52.920> it<00:03:53.100> in<00:03:53.220> with<00:03:53.250> compost

00:03:53.990 --> 00:03:54.000 
this biochar you mix it in with compost

00:03:54.000 --> 00:03:58.940 
this biochar you mix it in with compost
and<00:03:55.879> eventually<00:03:57.500> when<00:03:58.500> you're<00:03:58.650> doing<00:03:58.920> your

00:03:58.940 --> 00:03:58.950 
and eventually when you're doing your

00:03:58.950 --> 00:04:01.309 
and eventually when you're doing your
plantings<00:03:59.730> as<00:04:00.120> they've<00:04:00.629> done<00:04:00.840> the<00:04:00.989> guard

00:04:01.309 --> 00:04:01.319 
plantings as they've done the guard

00:04:01.319 --> 00:04:05.929 
plantings as they've done the guard
here<00:04:01.650> you<00:04:02.519> put<00:04:02.819> this<00:04:02.969> in<00:04:03.239> with<00:04:03.569> your<00:04:04.040> soil<00:04:05.040> with

00:04:05.929 --> 00:04:05.939 
here you put this in with your soil with

00:04:05.939 --> 00:04:08.690 
here you put this in with your soil with
the<00:04:06.120> with<00:04:06.420> the<00:04:06.450> plant<00:04:06.870> and<00:04:07.200> what<00:04:07.950> you<00:04:08.099> do<00:04:08.370> is

00:04:08.690 --> 00:04:08.700 
the with the plant and what you do is

00:04:08.700 --> 00:04:11.989 
the with the plant and what you do is
you<00:04:09.060> increase<00:04:09.569> the<00:04:09.810> production<00:04:10.319> of<00:04:10.999> the

00:04:11.989 --> 00:04:11.999 
you increase the production of the

00:04:11.999 --> 00:04:14.270 
you increase the production of the
output<00:04:12.540> of<00:04:12.689> the<00:04:12.780> plant<00:04:13.230> the<00:04:13.769> plants<00:04:14.129> will<00:04:14.219> grow

00:04:14.270 --> 00:04:14.280 
output of the plant the plants will grow

00:04:14.280 --> 00:04:17.770 
output of the plant the plants will grow
bigger<00:04:14.670> healthier<00:04:15.299> and<00:04:15.569> the<00:04:16.350> reason<00:04:16.530> is

00:04:17.770 --> 00:04:17.780 
bigger healthier and the reason is

00:04:17.780 --> 00:04:21.920 
bigger healthier and the reason is
what's<00:04:18.780> in<00:04:19.079> the<00:04:19.229> biochar<00:04:20.120> what's<00:04:21.120> in<00:04:21.299> biomass

00:04:21.920 --> 00:04:21.930 
what's in the biochar what's in biomass

00:04:21.930 --> 00:04:26.200 
what's in the biochar what's in biomass
are<00:04:22.889> nutrients<00:04:23.580> and<00:04:24.080> we<00:04:25.080> have<00:04:25.259> a<00:04:25.289> way<00:04:25.620> of

00:04:26.200 --> 00:04:26.210 
are nutrients and we have a way of

00:04:26.210 --> 00:04:31.279 
are nutrients and we have a way of
containing<00:04:27.210> those<00:04:27.509> nutrients<00:04:28.169> and<00:04:30.289> retaining

00:04:31.279 --> 00:04:31.289 
containing those nutrients and retaining

00:04:31.289 --> 00:04:33.980 
containing those nutrients and retaining
them<00:04:31.650> in<00:04:31.949> the<00:04:32.520> biochar<00:04:33.120> so<00:04:33.389> when<00:04:33.539> you<00:04:33.630> mix<00:04:33.810> it

00:04:33.980 --> 00:04:33.990 
them in the biochar so when you mix it

00:04:33.990 --> 00:04:37.339 
them in the biochar so when you mix it
in<00:04:34.080> with<00:04:34.110> the<00:04:34.229> soil<00:04:34.560> using<00:04:35.460> a<00:04:35.910> natural<00:04:36.630> process

00:04:37.339 --> 00:04:37.349 
in with the soil using a natural process

00:04:37.349 --> 00:04:41.749 
in with the soil using a natural process
of<00:04:38.960> increasing<00:04:39.960> our<00:04:40.830> production<00:04:41.490> of<00:04:41.610> our

00:04:41.749 --> 00:04:41.759 
of increasing our production of our

00:04:41.759 --> 00:04:45.860 
of increasing our production of our
garden<00:04:42.180> where<00:04:43.009> the<00:04:44.300> larger<00:04:45.300> manufacturers

00:04:45.860 --> 00:04:45.870 
garden where the larger manufacturers

00:04:45.870 --> 00:04:48.770 
garden where the larger manufacturers
tend<00:04:46.470> to<00:04:46.650> use<00:04:46.770> chemicals<00:04:47.419> we're<00:04:48.419> not<00:04:48.539> using

00:04:48.770 --> 00:04:48.780 
tend to use chemicals we're not using

00:04:48.780 --> 00:04:49.999 
tend to use chemicals we're not using
chemicals<00:04:49.410> we're<00:04:49.530> using<00:04:49.710> all-natural

00:04:49.999 --> 00:04:50.009 
chemicals we're using all-natural

00:04:50.009 --> 00:04:52.700 
chemicals we're using all-natural
products<00:04:50.990> the<00:04:51.990> other<00:04:52.139> thing<00:04:52.410> that<00:04:52.590> the

00:04:52.700 --> 00:04:52.710 
products the other thing that the

00:04:52.710 --> 00:04:57.320 
products the other thing that the
biochar<00:04:53.310> does<00:04:53.639> is<00:04:54.169> it<00:04:55.169> it's<00:04:56.160> a<00:04:56.400> good<00:04:57.000> water

00:04:57.320 --> 00:04:57.330 
biochar does is it it's a good water

00:04:57.330 --> 00:05:00.710 
biochar does is it it's a good water
absorber<00:04:58.139> so<00:04:58.860> it<00:04:59.220> absorbs<00:04:59.490> the<00:05:00.090> water<00:05:00.120> as

00:05:00.710 --> 00:05:00.720 
absorber so it absorbs the water as

00:05:00.720 --> 00:05:03.379 
absorber so it absorbs the water as
you're<00:05:01.050> watering<00:05:01.440> your<00:05:01.650> plants<00:05:01.710> and<00:05:02.400> it

00:05:03.379 --> 00:05:03.389 
you're watering your plants and it

00:05:03.389 --> 00:05:06.589 
you're watering your plants and it
preserves<00:05:04.110> the<00:05:04.650> water<00:05:04.889> longer<00:05:05.400> around<00:05:06.389> your

00:05:06.589 --> 00:05:06.599 
preserves the water longer around your

00:05:06.599 --> 00:05:08.960 
preserves the water longer around your
plants<00:05:07.020> and<00:05:07.139> your<00:05:07.229> plant<00:05:07.470> roots<00:05:07.740> so<00:05:08.490> obviously

00:05:08.960 --> 00:05:08.970 
plants and your plant roots so obviously

00:05:08.970 --> 00:05:11.510 
plants and your plant roots so obviously
that<00:05:09.330> means<00:05:09.389> less<00:05:09.870> watering<00:05:10.440> or<00:05:10.919> it<00:05:11.370> can

00:05:11.510 --> 00:05:11.520 
that means less watering or it can

00:05:11.520 --> 00:05:14.170 
that means less watering or it can
survive<00:05:11.849> longer<00:05:12.630> without<00:05:13.110> without<00:05:13.680> water

00:05:14.170 --> 00:05:14.180 
survive longer without without water

00:05:14.180 --> 00:05:17.210 
survive longer without without water
what's<00:05:15.180> in<00:05:15.330> the<00:05:15.419> biochar<00:05:16.110> that<00:05:16.620> makes<00:05:16.860> it<00:05:17.009> so

00:05:17.210 --> 00:05:17.220 
what's in the biochar that makes it so

00:05:17.220 --> 00:05:21.860 
what's in the biochar that makes it so
good<00:05:17.460> for<00:05:17.699> the<00:05:17.759> soil<00:05:18.180> and<00:05:18.720> the<00:05:19.650> plans<00:05:20.870> we're

00:05:21.860 --> 00:05:21.870 
good for the soil and the plans we're

00:05:21.870 --> 00:05:25.490 
good for the soil and the plans we're

00:05:25.490 --> 00:05:25.500 
changing the process of how the co2 is

00:05:25.500 --> 00:05:28.820 
changing the process of how the co2 is
being<00:05:25.770> released<00:05:26.030> okay<00:05:27.030> so<00:05:27.810> instead<00:05:28.620> of<00:05:28.680> it

00:05:28.820 --> 00:05:28.830

being<00:05:28.860> released<00:05:29.430> in<00:05:29.639> the<00:05:29.669> air<00:05:31.400> we're<00:05:32.400> going<00:05:32.669> to

00:05:32.749 --> 00:05:32.759 
being released in the air we're going to

00:05:32.759 --> 00:05:35.629 
being released in the air we're going to
be<00:05:32.909> sequestering<00:05:33.900> it<00:05:34.169> in<00:05:34.889> putting<00:05:35.400> it<00:05:35.520> into

00:05:35.629 --> 00:05:35.639

00:05:35.639 --> 00:05:37.399 
be sequestering it in putting it into
the<00:05:35.820> ground<00:05:35.909> and<00:05:36.630> once<00:05:36.810> it's<00:05:36.990> in<00:05:37.110> the<00:05:37.199> ground

00:05:37.399 --> 00:05:37.409 
the ground and once it's in the ground

00:05:37.409 --> 00:05:40.940 
the ground and once it's in the ground
it's<00:05:37.500> in<00:05:37.710> there<00:05:37.860> for<00:05:38.070> thousands<00:05:38.669> of<00:05:38.759> us
