good<00:00:00.539> afternoon<00:00:00.690> everyone<00:00:01.140> today<00:00:02.040> I<00:00:02.070> would

00:00:02.210 --> 00:00:02.220 
good afternoon everyone today I would

00:00:02.220 --> 00:00:04.220 
good afternoon everyone today I would
like<00:00:02.250> to<00:00:02.340> talk<00:00:02.610> about<00:00:02.790> early<00:00:03.720> snow<00:00:03.959> falls

00:00:04.220 --> 00:00:04.230 
like to talk about early snow falls

00:00:04.230 --> 00:00:06.170 
like to talk about early snow falls
across<00:00:04.470> Eurasia<00:00:05.040> and<00:00:05.370> how<00:00:05.790> that<00:00:05.850> is<00:00:06.150> affecting

00:00:06.170 --> 00:00:06.180 
across Eurasia and how that is affecting

00:00:06.180 --> 00:00:09.410 
across Eurasia and how that is affecting
the<00:00:06.750> grain<00:00:06.960> harvest<00:00:07.379> at<00:00:07.470> this<00:00:07.620> time<00:00:08.120> the<00:00:09.120> snow

00:00:09.410 --> 00:00:09.420 
the grain harvest at this time the snow

00:00:09.420 --> 00:00:11.780 
the grain harvest at this time the snow
and<00:00:09.719> moisture<00:00:09.900> on<00:00:10.410> the<00:00:10.469> seeds<00:00:10.980> will<00:00:11.490> create

00:00:11.780 --> 00:00:11.790 
and moisture on the seeds will create

00:00:11.790 --> 00:00:14.209 
and moisture on the seeds will create
mold<00:00:12.030> so<00:00:12.809> the<00:00:12.929> total<00:00:13.139> amount<00:00:13.650> of<00:00:13.980> grain

00:00:14.209 --> 00:00:14.219 
mold so the total amount of grain

00:00:14.219 --> 00:00:15.829 
mold so the total amount of grain
harvest<00:00:14.670> could<00:00:14.880> be<00:00:15.000> a<00:00:15.030> certain<00:00:15.389> number<00:00:15.509> but

00:00:15.829 --> 00:00:15.839 
harvest could be a certain number but

00:00:15.839 --> 00:00:18.050 
harvest could be a certain number but
the<00:00:15.960> actual<00:00:16.320> usable<00:00:16.590> amount<00:00:17.160> of<00:00:17.279> grain<00:00:17.580> from

00:00:18.050 --> 00:00:18.060 
the actual usable amount of grain from

00:00:18.060 --> 00:00:19.519 
the actual usable amount of grain from
that<00:00:18.240> harvest<00:00:18.660> will<00:00:18.869> be<00:00:18.900> something<00:00:19.289> quite

00:00:19.519 --> 00:00:19.529 
that harvest will be something quite

00:00:19.529 --> 00:00:26.589 
that harvest will be something quite
different

00:00:26.589 --> 00:00:26.599 

00:00:26.599 --> 00:00:29.330 

the<00:00:27.599> entire<00:00:27.840> premise<00:00:28.289> of<00:00:28.439> my<00:00:28.560> videos<00:00:28.919> is<00:00:29.130> based

00:00:29.330 --> 00:00:29.340 
the entire premise of my videos is based

00:00:29.340 --> 00:00:33.889 
the entire premise of my videos is based
on<00:00:29.640> the<00:00:30.029> idea<00:00:30.660> that<00:00:30.980> solar<00:00:31.980> cycle<00:00:32.279> 25<00:00:32.699> and<00:00:33.090> 26

00:00:33.889 --> 00:00:33.899 
on the idea that solar cycle 25 and 26

00:00:33.899 --> 00:00:36.139 
on the idea that solar cycle 25 and 26
will<00:00:34.199> have<00:00:34.320> decreased<00:00:34.829> solar<00:00:35.040> activity<00:00:35.250> which

00:00:36.139 --> 00:00:36.149 
will have decreased solar activity which

00:00:36.149 --> 00:00:38.090 
will have decreased solar activity which
will<00:00:36.270> usher<00:00:36.420> in<00:00:36.600> an<00:00:36.989> era<00:00:37.379> of<00:00:37.590> cooler

00:00:38.090 --> 00:00:38.100 
will usher in an era of cooler

00:00:38.100 --> 00:00:40.130 
will usher in an era of cooler
temperatures<00:00:38.610> for<00:00:38.850> the<00:00:38.910> next<00:00:39.149> 30<00:00:39.420> years<00:00:39.510> or<00:00:39.930> so

00:00:40.130 --> 00:00:40.140 
temperatures for the next 30 years or so

00:00:40.140 --> 00:00:42.500 
temperatures for the next 30 years or so
one<00:00:41.100> of<00:00:41.190> the<00:00:41.280> main<00:00:41.430> things<00:00:41.460> I'm<00:00:41.910> focused<00:00:42.300> on<00:00:42.449> is

00:00:42.500 --> 00:00:42.510 
one of the main things I'm focused on is

00:00:42.510 --> 00:00:45.229 
one of the main things I'm focused on is
the<00:00:42.780> grain<00:00:43.079> harvest<00:00:43.680> in<00:00:43.920> the<00:00:44.730> amount<00:00:45.059> of

00:00:45.229 --> 00:00:45.239 
the grain harvest in the amount of

00:00:45.239 --> 00:00:47.840 
the grain harvest in the amount of
available<00:00:45.780> grains<00:00:46.470> for<00:00:46.829> the<00:00:46.949> planet<00:00:47.430> as<00:00:47.579> the

00:00:47.840 --> 00:00:47.850 
available grains for the planet as the

00:00:47.850 --> 00:00:50.240 
available grains for the planet as the
temperatures<00:00:48.390> get<00:00:48.690> cooler<00:00:49.140> here<00:00:49.980> we<00:00:50.100> are

the<00:03:39.730> fields<00:03:40.000> are<00:03:40.060> going<00:03:40.209> to<00:03:40.269> get<00:03:40.389> soggy<00:03:40.629> it's

00:03:41.220 --> 00:03:41.230 
the fields are going to get soggy it's

00:03:41.230 --> 00:03:42.830 
the fields are going to get soggy it's
going<00:03:41.439> to<00:03:41.469> snow<00:03:41.709> early<00:03:42.069> and<00:03:42.189> that<00:03:42.280> will<00:03:42.430> affect

00:03:42.830 --> 00:03:42.840 
going to snow early and that will affect

00:03:42.840 --> 00:03:45.210 
going to snow early and that will affect
the<00:03:43.840> harvest<00:03:44.259> now<00:03:44.409> look<00:03:44.590> at<00:03:44.709> this<00:03:44.859> there's

00:03:45.210 --> 00:03:45.220 
the harvest now look at this there's

00:03:45.220 --> 00:03:46.740 
the harvest now look at this there's
less<00:03:45.370> than<00:03:45.400> fifteen<00:03:45.909> percent<00:03:46.269> on<00:03:46.419> the<00:03:46.509> corn

00:03:46.740 --> 00:03:46.750 
less than fifteen percent on the corn

00:03:46.750 --> 00:03:48.929 
less than fifteen percent on the corn
crop<00:03:47.500> usually<00:03:48.280> they're<00:03:48.430> around<00:03:48.639> fifty

00:03:48.929 --> 00:03:48.939 
crop usually they're around fifty

00:03:48.939 --> 00:03:50.429 
crop usually they're around fifty
percent<00:03:49.209> harvest<00:03:49.629> by<00:03:49.720> this<00:03:49.930> time<00:03:50.139> that's

00:03:50.429 --> 00:03:50.439 
percent harvest by this time that's

00:03:50.439 --> 00:03:52.439 
percent harvest by this time that's
thirty<00:03:50.650> five<00:03:50.859> percent<00:03:50.889> below<00:03:51.430> normal<00:03:51.639> this

00:03:52.439 --> 00:03:52.449 
thirty five percent below normal this

00:03:52.449 --> 00:03:54.330 
thirty five percent below normal this
will<00:03:52.599> be<00:03:52.689> a<00:03:52.720> recurring<00:03:53.139> trendy<00:03:53.739> or<00:03:53.769> upon<00:03:54.069> year

00:03:54.330 --> 00:03:54.340 
will be a recurring trendy or upon year

00:04:00.280 --> 00:04:02.879 
wheat crop what I'm trying to show you
here<00:04:00.699> in<00:04:00.970> the<00:04:01.150> videos<00:04:01.509> is<00:04:01.870> that<00:04:02.109> this<00:04:02.530> is<00:04:02.709> not

00:04:02.879 --> 00:04:02.889 
here in the videos is that this is not

00:04:02.889 --> 00:04:05.189 
here in the videos is that this is not
something<00:04:03.250> in<00:04:03.519> the<00:04:03.579> future<00:04:03.970> this<00:04:04.599> is<00:04:04.780> not<00:04:04.930> an

00:04:05.189 --> 00:04:05.199 
something in the future this is not an

00:04:05.199 --> 00:04:07.110 
something in the future this is not an
event<00:04:05.349> that<00:04:05.709> we<00:04:05.799> have<00:04:05.949> to<00:04:06.099> prepare<00:04:06.459> for<00:04:06.519> 20

00:04:07.110 --> 00:04:07.120 
event that we have to prepare for 20

00:04:07.120 --> 00:04:10.080 
event that we have to prepare for 20
years<00:04:07.389> from<00:04:07.540> now<00:04:07.629> it<00:04:08.439> has<00:04:08.919> arrived<00:04:09.669> already

00:04:10.080 --> 00:04:10.090 
years from now it has arrived already

00:04:10.090 --> 00:04:12.119 
years from now it has arrived already
and<00:04:10.780> this<00:04:10.900> is<00:04:11.109> the<00:04:11.259> first<00:04:11.290> couple<00:04:11.979> of<00:04:12.069> years

00:04:12.119 --> 00:04:12.129 
and this is the first couple of years

00:04:12.129 --> 00:04:14.189 
and this is the first couple of years
that<00:04:12.669> the<00:04:12.790> signs<00:04:13.030> are<00:04:13.269> showing<00:04:13.689> there's<00:04:14.079> no

00:04:14.189 --> 00:04:14.199 
that the signs are showing there's no

00:04:14.199 --> 00:04:16.649 
that the signs are showing there's no
more<00:04:14.349> preparation<00:04:14.709> its<00:04:15.280> implementation<00:04:16.000> my

next<00:04:16.900> solution<00:04:17.109> is<00:04:17.380> vertical<00:04:17.769> farming<00:04:18.130> you

00:04:18.300 --> 00:04:18.310 
next solution is vertical farming you

00:04:18.310 --> 00:04:20.490 
next solution is vertical farming you
can<00:04:18.699> do<00:04:18.820> that<00:04:18.940> on<00:04:19.090> an<00:04:19.209> industrial<00:04:19.539> scale<00:04:19.870> using

00:04:20.490 --> 00:04:20.500 
can do that on an industrial scale using

00:04:20.500 --> 00:04:22.770 
can do that on an industrial scale using
disused<00:04:21.130> factory<00:04:21.639> space<00:04:21.880> is<00:04:22.150> converted<00:04:22.630> into

00:04:22.770 --> 00:04:22.780 
disused factory space is converted into

00:04:22.780 --> 00:04:25.680 
disused factory space is converted into
