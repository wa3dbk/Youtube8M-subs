content in my mind we can't do it all at
the<00:01:26.070> same<00:01:26.280> time<00:01:26.340> so<00:01:26.880> it's<00:01:27.030> about<00:01:27.119> making<00:01:27.479> sure

00:01:27.710 --> 00:01:27.720 
the same time so it's about making sure

00:01:27.720 --> 00:01:29.690

what's<00:01:28.110> right<00:01:28.350> for<00:01:28.560> the<00:01:28.619> game<00:01:28.799> and<00:01:29.070> when<00:01:29.340> how

00:01:29.690 --> 00:01:29.700 
what's right for the game and when how

00:01:29.700 --> 00:01:31.069 
what's right for the game and when how
do<00:01:29.759> you<00:01:29.970> decide<00:01:30.210> okay<00:01:30.479> with<00:01:30.630> this<00:01:30.689> contents

00:01:31.069 --> 00:01:31.079 
do you decide okay with this contents

00:01:31.079 --> 00:01:32.149 
do you decide okay with this contents
going<00:01:31.229> to<00:01:31.290> go<00:01:31.380> in<00:01:31.500> and<00:01:31.530> this<00:01:31.680> content<00:01:32.040> isn't

00:01:33.740 --> 00:01:33.750 
going to go in a lot of the time it's

00:01:33.750 --> 00:01:36.740 
going to go in a lot of the time it's
about<00:01:33.950> availability<00:01:34.950> it's<00:01:35.579> about<00:01:35.750> working

00:01:36.740 --> 00:01:36.750 
about availability it's about working

00:01:36.750 --> 00:01:38.569 
about availability it's about working
out<00:01:37.020> how<00:01:37.229> many<00:01:37.290> hours<00:01:37.590> we've<00:01:37.979> got<00:01:38.189> in<00:01:38.340> every

out how many hours we've got in every

00:01:38.579 --> 00:01:40.340 
out how many hours we've got in every
day<00:01:38.759> how<00:01:39.000> many<00:01:39.210> hours<00:01:39.360> each<00:01:39.659> department<00:01:40.259> have

got to work on things and then sort of

00:01:42.509 --> 00:01:43.969 
got to work on things and then sort of
fitting<00:01:42.840> everything<00:01:43.049> together<00:01:43.320> almost<00:01:43.710> like

00:01:55.340 --> 00:01:55.350 
example which we should be seeing into

00:01:55.350 --> 00:01:56.749

Quest that we've got coming up in the
next<00:02:04.020> few<00:02:04.380> months<00:02:04.530> has<00:02:04.950> been<00:02:05.009> about<00:02:05.850> nine<00:02:06.119> to

00:02:06.410 --> 00:02:06.420 
next few months has been about nine to

next few months has been about nine to
twelve<00:02:06.659> months<00:02:06.950> development<00:02:07.950> time<00:02:08.129> even

twelve months development time even

00:02:08.879 --> 00:02:10.490 
twelve months development time even
though<00:02:09.060> I've<00:02:09.239> been<00:02:09.599> here<00:02:09.899> almost<00:02:10.050> ten<00:02:10.470> years

00:02:10.490 --> 00:02:10.500 
though I've been here almost ten years

00:02:10.500 --> 00:02:13.220 
though I've been here almost ten years
I'm<00:02:11.069> still<00:02:11.540> surprised<00:02:12.540> by<00:02:12.810> the<00:02:12.870> amount<00:02:12.959> of

00:02:13.220 --> 00:02:13.230 
I'm still surprised by the amount of

00:02:13.230 --> 00:02:13.590 
I'm still surprised by the amount of
demand

00:02:13.590 --> 00:02:13.600 
demand

00:02:13.600 --> 00:02:15.330 
demand
in<00:02:13.690> time<00:02:13.900> than<00:02:14.080> it<00:02:14.200> takes<00:02:14.350> to<00:02:14.590> do<00:02:15.100> certain

00:02:15.330 --> 00:02:15.340 
in time than it takes to do certain

00:02:15.340 --> 00:02:16.920 
in time than it takes to do certain
things<00:02:15.490> it<00:02:15.940> doesn't<00:02:16.120> surprise<00:02:16.360> me<00:02:16.510> that<00:02:16.720> the

00:02:16.920 --> 00:02:16.930 
things it doesn't surprise me that the

00:02:16.930 --> 00:02:18.810 
things it doesn't surprise me that the
players<00:02:17.200> kind<00:02:17.410> of<00:02:17.500> underestimate<00:02:18.250> the<00:02:18.670> amount

00:02:18.810 --> 00:02:18.820 
players kind of underestimate the amount

00:02:18.820 --> 00:02:20.790 
players kind of underestimate the amount
of<00:02:18.910> work<00:02:19.090> that<00:02:19.150> it<00:02:19.420> takes<00:02:19.450> because<00:02:19.930> I<00:02:20.320> do<00:02:20.380> every

00:02:20.790 --> 00:02:20.800 
of work that it takes because I do every

00:02:20.800 --> 00:02:22.950 
of work that it takes because I do every
single<00:02:20.920> day<00:02:21.100> so<00:02:21.490> would<00:02:21.850> you<00:02:21.940> say<00:02:21.970> then<00:02:22.330> that<00:02:22.360> ok

00:02:22.950 --> 00:02:22.960 
single day so would you say then that ok

00:02:22.960 --> 00:02:24.600 
single day so would you say then that ok
10<00:02:23.140> years<00:02:23.320> ago<00:02:23.440> making<00:02:23.800> a<00:02:23.980> quest<00:02:24.250> with<00:02:24.310> a<00:02:24.430> lot

00:02:24.600 --> 00:02:24.610 
10 years ago making a quest with a lot

00:02:24.610 --> 00:02:26.310 
10 years ago making a quest with a lot
of<00:02:24.700> it<00:02:24.850> is<00:02:25.000> a<00:02:25.030> much<00:02:25.210> simpler<00:02:25.510> process<00:02:25.720> the

00:02:26.310 --> 00:02:26.320 
of it is a much simpler process the

00:02:26.320 --> 00:02:28.590 
of it is a much simpler process the
content<00:02:26.830> that<00:02:26.890> we're<00:02:27.070> producing<00:02:27.220> now<00:02:27.730> is<00:02:28.000> so

00:02:28.590 --> 00:02:28.600 
content that we're producing now is so

00:02:28.600 --> 00:02:30.090 
content that we're producing now is so
much<00:02:28.720> more<00:02:28.750> challenging<00:02:29.110> to<00:02:29.650> make<00:02:29.830> just

00:02:30.090 --> 00:02:30.100 
much more challenging to make just

00:02:30.100 --> 00:02:31.440 
much more challenging to make just
because<00:02:30.250> we've<00:02:30.370> got<00:02:30.460> so<00:02:30.670> many<00:02:30.820> more<00:02:31.060> things<00:02:31.270> to

00:02:31.440 --> 00:02:31.450 
because we've got so many more things to

00:02:31.450 --> 00:02:33.240 
because we've got so many more things to
think<00:02:31.600> about<00:02:31.720> for<00:02:32.140> example<00:02:32.500> the<00:02:32.560> graphics<00:02:32.980> and

00:02:33.240 --> 00:02:33.250 
think about for example the graphics and

00:02:33.250 --> 00:02:35.160 
think about for example the graphics and
the<00:02:33.700> quality<00:02:33.970> of<00:02:34.210> the<00:02:34.360> graphics<00:02:34.720> that<00:02:34.840> we<00:02:34.960> can

00:02:35.160 --> 00:02:35.170 
the quality of the graphics that we can

00:02:35.170 --> 00:02:37.500 
the quality of the graphics that we can
produce<00:02:35.350> now<00:02:35.770> is<00:02:36.010> is<00:02:36.370> astronomically<00:02:37.300> higher

00:02:37.500 --> 00:02:37.510 
produce now is is astronomically higher

00:02:37.510 --> 00:02:39.210 
produce now is is astronomically higher
than<00:02:37.780> it<00:02:37.870> was<00:02:37.900> before<00:02:38.200> we<00:02:38.710> have<00:02:38.800> a<00:02:38.860> lot<00:02:39.040> more

00:02:39.210 --> 00:02:39.220 
than it was before we have a lot more

00:02:39.220 --> 00:02:41.490 
than it was before we have a lot more
investment<00:02:39.940> in<00:02:40.030> things<00:02:40.330> like<00:02:40.420> 2d<00:02:40.930> concepts

00:02:41.490 --> 00:02:41.500 
investment in things like 2d concepts

00:02:41.500 --> 00:02:43.500 
investment in things like 2d concepts
are<00:02:41.650> so<00:02:41.950> that<00:02:42.160> we've<00:02:42.310> got<00:02:42.730> a<00:02:42.760> team<00:02:42.970> of<00:02:43.030> artists

00:02:43.500 --> 00:02:43.510 
are so that we've got a team of artists

00:02:43.510 --> 00:02:45.450 
are so that we've got a team of artists
that<00:02:43.630> will<00:02:43.720> actually<00:02:43.900> produce<00:02:44.560> really<00:02:45.250> cool

00:02:45.450 --> 00:02:45.460 
that will actually produce really cool

00:02:45.460 --> 00:02:46.770 
that will actually produce really cool
images<00:02:45.850> for<00:02:46.090> the<00:02:46.120> modelers<00:02:46.540> and<00:02:46.540> the

00:02:46.770 --> 00:02:46.780 
images for the modelers and the

00:02:46.780 --> 00:02:48.720 
images for the modelers and the
animators<00:02:47.260> to<00:02:47.290> learn<00:02:47.590> from<00:02:47.860> audio<00:02:48.340> is<00:02:48.460> a<00:02:48.580> lot

00:02:48.720 --> 00:02:48.730 
animators to learn from audio is a lot

00:02:48.730 --> 00:02:50.370 
animators to learn from audio is a lot
better<00:02:48.850> now<00:02:49.150> as<00:02:49.330> well<00:02:49.540> you<00:02:49.840> know<00:02:49.960> the<00:02:50.170> quality

00:02:50.370 --> 00:02:50.380 
better now as well you know the quality

00:02:50.380 --> 00:02:52.950 
better now as well you know the quality
of<00:02:50.650> the<00:02:50.860> audio<00:02:50.980> that<00:02:51.340> we're<00:02:51.460> producing<00:02:51.960> using

00:02:52.950 --> 00:02:52.960 
of the audio that we're producing using
