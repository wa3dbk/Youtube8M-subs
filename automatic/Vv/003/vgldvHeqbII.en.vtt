00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.350
 hello my name is Anastasia 

00:00:01.380 --> 00:00:05.779
 violin rip makeup on you on ds. 

00:00:04.350 --> 00:00:07.890
 today my video will be dedicated 

00:00:05.779 --> 00:00:09.480
 natural makeup why I decided 

00:00:07.890 --> 00:00:12.090
 record this video because under each 

00:00:09.480 --> 00:00:14.160
 video literally every girl wrote 

00:00:12.090 --> 00:00:16.410
 Please write down the life I have I 

00:00:14.160 --> 00:00:18.960
 decided to combine all your requests one 

00:00:16.410 --> 00:00:21.140
 so today we can make out 

00:00:18.960 --> 00:00:25.560
 naturally kiyashko tory already on the Internet 

00:00:21.140 --> 00:00:27.240
 It was recorded correctly 90 times then probably 

00:00:25.560 --> 00:00:29.880
 every hall thinks for natural 

00:00:27.240 --> 00:00:31.500
 make-up there are certain rules and if 

00:00:29.880 --> 00:00:33.450
 you go through these rules then all 

00:00:31.500 --> 00:00:34.920
 will forget and apply makeup again 

00:00:33.450 --> 00:00:36.600
 no point is that for natural 

00:00:34.920 --> 00:00:38.250
 make-up is more characteristic some 

00:00:36.600 --> 00:00:40.530
 bans rather than any rules 

00:00:38.250 --> 00:00:42.270
 I think that the name of the tier leg of the forest 

00:00:40.530 --> 00:00:44.340
 here the main thing is naturalness 

00:00:42.270 --> 00:00:48.120
 I think that the main right ralny 

00:00:44.340 --> 00:00:50.219
 kia chews arash even the complexion of the salmon 

00:00:48.120 --> 00:00:51.870
 eyes bright lips and here you are please 

00:00:50.219 --> 00:00:53.610
 makeup is already ready to just natural 

00:00:51.870 --> 00:00:55.860
 find what you want in yourself 

00:00:53.610 --> 00:00:57.660
 underline it is she who does accent 

00:00:55.860 --> 00:00:59.190
 emphasize here is some kind of zest in 

00:00:57.660 --> 00:01:02.280
 your face and then everything will be great 

00:00:59.190 --> 00:01:04.860
 Today's make-up, I did this straight 

00:01:02.280 --> 00:01:07.229
 here is a neutral makeup that can be it 

00:01:04.860 --> 00:01:09.680
 record fix it absolutely 

00:01:07.229 --> 00:01:12.750
 everyone fit I tried I 

00:01:09.680 --> 00:01:14.490
 experimented and actually in 

00:01:12.750 --> 00:01:16.049
 this support at the expense of every girl 

00:01:14.490 --> 00:01:18.030
 if we talk to you about age 

00:01:16.049 --> 00:01:19.890
 make-up then there is a small rule 

00:01:18.030 --> 00:01:22.979
 the most basic thing we have to do 

00:01:19.890 --> 00:01:25.049
 pay attention to this lightness 

00:01:22.979 --> 00:01:27.960
 The texture of our tonal framework is the most 

00:01:25.049 --> 00:01:29.820
 the best for age 

00:01:27.960 --> 00:01:31.710
 skins that i have ever tried i 

00:01:29.820 --> 00:01:33.960
 that's if our title so that we could 

00:01:31.710 --> 00:01:38.189
 rewrite this pissing light texture 

00:01:33.960 --> 00:01:41.579
 very easy to apply and here as age 

00:01:38.189 --> 00:01:44.130
 make-up need to be removed altogether and throw out 

00:01:41.579 --> 00:01:46.320
 all mother of pearl to her cosmetic bag 

00:01:44.130 --> 00:01:48.509
 all iridescent hayloft shadows 

00:01:46.320 --> 00:01:50.640
 no age makeup 

00:01:48.509 --> 00:01:53.220
 use dark shadows because they 

00:01:50.640 --> 00:01:55.439
 visually deepen the eye to draw a conclusion 

00:01:53.220 --> 00:01:57.600
 so small use all light 

00:01:55.439 --> 00:02:00.479
 shades that you generally have also 

00:01:57.600 --> 00:02:02.280
 without concealers, you definitely won't do 

00:02:00.479 --> 00:02:04.170
 there is a wonderful concealer who 

00:02:02.280 --> 00:02:05.670
 removes all age spots on face 

00:02:04.170 --> 00:02:07.890
 again here I'll write it down 

00:02:05.670 --> 00:02:10.440
 buy it in the shop not 

00:02:07.890 --> 00:02:12.000
 regret it perfectly cleans everything 

00:02:10.440 --> 00:02:12.420
 age spots that you have on 

00:02:12.000 --> 00:02:14.940
 face 

00:02:12.420 --> 00:02:17.370
 finishing touch but for makeup base 

00:02:14.940 --> 00:02:18.989
 this is when it is applied for us 

00:02:17.370 --> 00:02:21.120
 loose powder in any case not 

00:02:18.989 --> 00:02:23.069

00:02:21.120 --> 00:02:25.319

00:02:27.480 --> 00:02:31.290
 a little on the t-zone is applied to remove 

00:02:29.670 --> 00:02:33.090
 Now that's what I excessive shine 

00:02:31.290 --> 00:02:34.830
 I pay so much attention to age 

00:02:33.090 --> 00:02:36.959

00:02:34.830 --> 00:02:39.480
