00:00:37.580 --> 00:00:37.590 
the dingo and secondly about a light

machine gun light machine guns in call

00:00:40.620 --> 00:00:42.889 
machine gun light machine guns in call
duty<00:00:40.860> have<00:00:41.160> kind<00:00:41.790> of<00:00:41.879> traditionally<00:00:42.540> been<00:00:42.719> a

00:00:42.889 --> 00:00:42.899 
duty have kind of traditionally been a

00:00:42.899 --> 00:00:45.529 
duty have kind of traditionally been a
little<00:00:43.170> bit<00:00:43.320> outlier<00:00:43.890> gun<00:00:44.250> types<00:00:44.550> they<00:00:45.120> don't

00:00:45.529 --> 00:00:45.539 
little bit outlier gun types they don't

00:00:45.539 --> 00:00:47.869 
little bit outlier gun types they don't
really<00:00:45.840> see<00:00:46.170> massive<00:00:46.710> play<00:00:47.280> and<00:00:47.520> that

00:00:47.869 --> 00:00:47.879 
really see massive play and that

00:00:47.879 --> 00:00:49.760 
really see massive play and that
especially<00:00:48.329> when<00:00:48.480> compared<00:00:48.899> to<00:00:49.140> assault

00:00:49.760 --> 00:00:49.770 
especially when compared to assault

00:00:49.770 --> 00:00:51.889 
especially when compared to assault
rifles<00:00:50.129> and<00:00:50.280> SMGs<00:00:50.510> now<00:00:51.510> that's<00:00:51.719> mainly

00:00:51.889 --> 00:00:51.899 
rifles and SMGs now that's mainly

00:00:51.899 --> 00:00:53.900 
rifles and SMGs now that's mainly
because<00:00:52.020> of<00:00:52.320> the<00:00:52.739> movement<00:00:53.340> speed<00:00:53.579> penalty

00:00:53.900 --> 00:00:53.910 
because of the movement speed penalty

00:00:53.910 --> 00:00:55.970 
because of the movement speed penalty
that<00:00:54.239> comes<00:00:54.539> with<00:00:55.199> light<00:00:55.469> machine<00:00:55.770> guns

00:00:55.970 --> 00:00:55.980 
that comes with light machine guns

00:00:55.980 --> 00:00:57.529 
that comes with light machine guns
generally<00:00:56.520> we're<00:00:56.910> using<00:00:57.090> a<00:00:57.270> light<00:00:57.390> machine

00:00:57.529 --> 00:00:57.539 
generally we're using a light machine

00:00:57.539 --> 00:00:59.569 
generally we're using a light machine
gun<00:00:57.840> in<00:00:57.930> a<00:00:58.020> Call<00:00:58.199> of<00:00:58.230> Duty<00:00:58.530> you<00:00:58.980> walk<00:00:59.250> a<00:00:59.280> little

00:00:59.569 --> 00:00:59.579 
gun in a Call of Duty you walk a little

00:00:59.579 --> 00:01:01.400 
gun in a Call of Duty you walk a little
bit<00:00:59.699> slower<00:01:00.030> you<00:01:00.180> run<00:01:00.690> a<00:01:00.719> little<00:01:00.960> bit<00:01:01.140> slower

00:01:01.400 --> 00:01:01.410 
bit slower you run a little bit slower

00:01:01.410 --> 00:01:03.349 
bit slower you run a little bit slower
you<00:01:01.920> aim<00:01:02.129> down<00:01:02.160> sights<00:01:02.609> a<00:01:02.730> little<00:01:02.760> bit<00:01:03.030> slower

00:01:03.349 --> 00:01:03.359 
you aim down sights a little bit slower

00:01:03.359 --> 00:01:07.789 
you aim down sights a little bit slower
and<00:01:03.480> so<00:01:03.899> on<00:01:04.140> well<00:01:04.799> guys<00:01:05.100> in<00:01:05.430> black<00:01:06.090> ops<00:01:06.360> 3<00:01:06.479> I<00:01:06.930> had

00:01:07.789 --> 00:01:07.799 
and so on well guys in black ops 3 I had

00:01:07.799 --> 00:01:10.370 
and so on well guys in black ops 3 I had
to<00:01:08.010> really<00:01:08.490> look<00:01:09.060> for<00:01:09.420> the<00:01:09.900> movement<00:01:10.260> speed

00:01:10.370 --> 00:01:10.380 
to really look for the movement speed

00:01:10.380 --> 00:01:11.960 
to really look for the movement speed
penalty<00:01:10.799> when<00:01:10.950> I<00:01:10.979> first<00:01:11.369> spawned<00:01:11.670> in<00:01:11.760> with<00:01:11.880> the

00:01:11.960 --> 00:01:11.970 
penalty when I first spawned in with the

00:01:11.970 --> 00:01:14.450 
penalty when I first spawned in with the
dingo<00:01:12.330> it<00:01:12.810> felt<00:01:13.229> like<00:01:13.439> I<00:01:13.560> was<00:01:13.710> just<00:01:14.040> using<00:01:14.369> an

00:01:14.450 --> 00:01:14.460 
dingo it felt like I was just using an

00:01:14.460 --> 00:01:17.030 
dingo it felt like I was just using an
assault<00:01:14.790> rifle<00:01:14.850> seriously<00:01:15.810> I<00:01:15.869> had<00:01:16.409> to<00:01:16.560> really

00:01:17.030 --> 00:01:17.040 
assault rifle seriously I had to really

00:01:17.040 --> 00:01:18.649 
assault rifle seriously I had to really
look<00:01:17.369> at<00:01:17.520> my<00:01:17.610> teammates<00:01:17.970> if<00:01:18.090> you<00:01:18.150> had<00:01:18.270> to<00:01:18.390> run

00:01:18.649 --> 00:01:18.659 
look at my teammates if you had to run

00:01:18.659 --> 00:01:21.260 
look at my teammates if you had to run
right<00:01:18.720> beside<00:01:19.350> someone<00:01:19.680> with<00:01:20.220> an<00:01:20.400> SMG<00:01:20.759> before

00:01:21.260 --> 00:01:21.270 
right beside someone with an SMG before

00:01:21.270 --> 00:01:23.899 
right beside someone with an SMG before
I<00:01:21.299> was<00:01:21.450> kinda<00:01:21.720> like<00:01:21.890> ok<00:01:22.890> they<00:01:23.159> are<00:01:23.189> moving<00:01:23.700> a

00:01:23.899 --> 00:01:23.909 
I was kinda like ok they are moving a

00:01:23.909 --> 00:01:26.210 
I was kinda like ok they are moving a
little<00:01:24.060> bit<00:01:24.180> faster<00:01:24.780> so<00:01:24.990> that<00:01:25.409> is<00:01:25.650> the<00:01:25.799> extent

00:01:26.210 --> 00:01:26.220 
little bit faster so that is the extent

00:01:26.220 --> 00:01:27.800 
little bit faster so that is the extent
of<00:01:26.340> your<00:01:26.400> movement<00:01:26.909> speed<00:01:26.939> penalty<00:01:27.509> is<00:01:27.659> that

00:01:27.800 --> 00:01:27.810 
of your movement speed penalty is that

00:01:27.810 --> 00:01:30.890 
of your movement speed penalty is that
you<00:01:27.900> barely<00:01:28.259> notice<00:01:28.680> it<00:01:29.009> not<00:01:29.610> only<00:01:29.759> that<00:01:29.939> but

00:01:30.890 --> 00:01:30.900 
you barely notice it not only that but

00:01:30.900 --> 00:01:32.539 
you barely notice it not only that but
that's<00:01:31.079> combined<00:01:31.470> with<00:01:31.710> the<00:01:31.829> fact<00:01:32.100> that<00:01:32.220> in

00:01:32.539 --> 00:01:32.549 
that's combined with the fact that in

00:01:32.549 --> 00:01:35.149 
that's combined with the fact that in
black<00:01:32.790> ops<00:01:33.060> 3<00:01:33.150> there's<00:01:33.750> unlimited<00:01:34.020> sprint

00:01:35.149 --> 00:01:35.159 
black ops 3 there's unlimited sprint

00:01:35.159 --> 00:01:37.100 
black ops 3 there's unlimited sprint
so<00:01:35.640> you<00:01:35.700> just<00:01:36.030> sprint<00:01:36.360> around<00:01:36.509> who<00:01:36.689> cares<00:01:36.960> if

00:01:37.100 --> 00:01:37.110 
so you just sprint around who cares if

00:01:37.110 --> 00:01:40.039 
so you just sprint around who cares if
you're<00:01:37.200> sprinting<00:01:37.710> you<00:01:38.040> know<00:01:38.159> 5%<00:01:38.750> slower<00:01:39.750> than

00:01:40.039 --> 00:01:40.049 
you're sprinting you know 5% slower than

00:01:40.049 --> 00:01:41.749 
you're sprinting you know 5% slower than
the<00:01:40.200> guy<00:01:40.350> besides<00:01:40.740> you<00:01:40.920> you're<00:01:41.340> basically

00:01:41.749 --> 00:01:41.759 
the guy besides you you're basically

00:01:41.759 --> 00:01:43.190 
the guy besides you you're basically
gonna<00:01:41.909> get<00:01:42.150> to<00:01:42.299> the<00:01:42.390> fight<00:01:42.600> at<00:01:42.720> the<00:01:42.810> same<00:01:42.840> time

00:01:43.190 --> 00:01:43.200 
gonna get to the fight at the same time

00:01:43.200 --> 00:01:44.359 
gonna get to the fight at the same time
in<00:01:43.350> fact<00:01:43.470> the<00:01:43.560> guy<00:01:43.710> beside<00:01:43.890> use<00:01:44.159> probably

00:01:44.359 --> 00:01:44.369 
in fact the guy beside use probably

00:01:44.369 --> 00:01:45.170 
in fact the guy beside use probably
gonna<00:01:44.490> die<00:01:44.700> first

00:01:45.170 --> 00:01:45.180 
gonna die first

00:01:45.180 --> 00:01:47.840 
gonna die first
so<00:01:45.750> it<00:01:46.380> really<00:01:46.770> doesn't<00:01:47.220> feel<00:01:47.250> like<00:01:47.640> there's

00:01:47.840 --> 00:01:47.850 
so it really doesn't feel like there's

00:01:47.850 --> 00:01:50.210 
so it really doesn't feel like there's
any<00:01:48.090> movement<00:01:48.329> speed<00:01:48.750> penalty<00:01:49.259> at<00:01:49.470> all<00:01:49.829> and

00:01:50.210 --> 00:01:50.220 
any movement speed penalty at all and

00:01:50.220 --> 00:01:51.889 
any movement speed penalty at all and
not<00:01:50.670> only<00:01:50.939> that<00:01:51.149> not<00:01:51.479> only<00:01:51.540> is<00:01:51.810> there

00:01:51.889 --> 00:01:51.899 
not only that not only is there

00:01:51.899 --> 00:01:54.260 
not only that not only is there
unlimited<00:01:52.439> sprint<00:01:52.740> but<00:01:53.340> you're<00:01:53.579> wall<00:01:53.939> running

00:01:54.260 --> 00:01:54.270 
unlimited sprint but you're wall running

00:01:54.270 --> 00:01:56.389 
unlimited sprint but you're wall running
and<00:01:54.570> double<00:01:54.930> jumping<00:01:55.320> and<00:01:55.500> jumping<00:01:55.770> over<00:01:56.009> shit

00:01:56.389 --> 00:01:56.399 
and double jumping and jumping over shit

00:01:56.399 --> 00:01:58.639 
and double jumping and jumping over shit
and<00:01:56.520> mantling<00:01:56.969> shit<00:01:57.240> and<00:01:57.390> so<00:01:57.930> the<00:01:58.170> movement

00:01:58.639 --> 00:01:58.649 
and mantling shit and so the movement

00:01:58.649 --> 00:02:00.319 
and mantling shit and so the movement
speed<00:01:58.890> has<00:01:59.100> been<00:01:59.280> just<00:01:59.549> increased<00:02:00.060> so<00:02:00.270> much

00:02:00.319 --> 00:02:00.329 
speed has been just increased so much

00:02:00.329 --> 00:02:02.889 
speed has been just increased so much
overall<00:02:00.840> that<00:02:01.500> again<00:02:01.890> I<00:02:02.070> can't<00:02:02.369> stress<00:02:02.490> enough

00:02:02.889 --> 00:02:02.899 
overall that again I can't stress enough

00:02:02.899 --> 00:02:06.499 
overall that again I can't stress enough
using<00:02:03.899> this<00:02:04.110> dingo<00:02:04.829> light<00:02:05.130> machine<00:02:05.610> gun<00:02:05.820> feels

00:02:06.499 --> 00:02:06.509 
using this dingo light machine gun feels

00:02:06.509 --> 00:02:09.529 
using this dingo light machine gun feels
like<00:02:06.840> using<00:02:07.170> a<00:02:07.409> freakin<00:02:07.890> 60<00:02:08.520> round<00:02:08.789> assault

00:02:09.529 --> 00:02:09.539

rifle and guys that is exactly how I

00:02:12.390 --> 00:02:13.309 
rifle and guys that is exactly how I
would<00:02:12.540> describe

00:02:13.309 --> 00:02:13.319 
would describe

the dingo light machine gun it seriously

00:02:15.719 --> 00:02:18.890 
the dingo light machine gun it seriously
feels<00:02:16.170> like<00:02:16.799> a<00:02:16.980> 60<00:02:17.609> round<00:02:18.000> assault<00:02:18.480> rifle<00:02:18.780> in

feels like a 60 round assault rifle in

00:02:18.900 --> 00:02:21.319 
feels like a 60 round assault rifle in
if<00:02:19.140> it<00:02:19.290> had<00:02:19.409> 30<00:02:19.680> rounds<00:02:20.099> and<00:02:20.250> they<00:02:20.670> would<00:02:20.849> be<00:02:21.090> in

00:02:21.319 --> 00:02:21.329 
if it had 30 rounds and they would be in

00:02:21.329 --> 00:02:23.539

the assault rifle category honestly I

00:02:23.549 --> 00:02:25.550 
the assault rifle category honestly I
would<00:02:23.760> like<00:02:23.969> this<00:02:24.209> better<00:02:24.569> still<00:02:25.140> better<00:02:25.409> than

would like this better still better than
the<00:02:25.620> hvk<00:02:26.280> srf<00:02:26.670> I'm<00:02:27.090> not<00:02:27.209> a<00:02:27.239> huge<00:02:27.480> fan<00:02:27.659> of<00:02:27.689> the

the hvk srf I'm not a huge fan of the

00:02:27.840 --> 00:02:32.509 
the hvk srf I'm not a huge fan of the
hvk<00:02:28.349> this<00:02:29.010> feels<00:02:29.459> like<00:02:29.819> a<00:02:30.299> more<00:02:30.900> powerful<00:02:31.519> more

00:02:48.440 --> 00:02:48.450 
much of a beast this gun is now let's

00:02:48.450 --> 00:02:49.910 
much of a beast this gun is now let's
just<00:02:48.569> talk<00:02:48.780> about<00:02:48.810> the<00:02:49.079> accuracy<00:02:49.470> for<00:02:49.889> a

00:02:49.910 --> 00:02:49.920 
just talk about the accuracy for a

00:02:49.920 --> 00:02:51.890 
just talk about the accuracy for a
little<00:02:50.099> bit<00:02:50.189> because<00:02:50.340> I<00:02:50.730> thought<00:02:51.120> and<00:02:51.419> the<00:02:51.750> you

00:02:51.890 --> 00:02:51.900 
little bit because I thought and the you

00:02:51.900 --> 00:02:53.420 
little bit because I thought and the you
know<00:02:52.019> the<00:02:52.139> description<00:02:52.650> of<00:02:52.769> the<00:02:52.859> actual<00:02:53.220> gun

00:02:53.420 --> 00:02:53.430 
know the description of the actual gun

00:02:53.430 --> 00:02:56.839 
know the description of the actual gun
says<00:02:53.730> it<00:02:53.849> has<00:02:53.970> moderate<00:02:54.569> recoil<00:02:55.489> this<00:02:56.489> is<00:02:56.669> not

00:02:56.839 --> 00:02:56.849 
says it has moderate recoil this is not

00:02:56.849 --> 00:02:59.659 
says it has moderate recoil this is not
moderate<00:02:57.419> recoil<00:02:57.599> this<00:02:58.109> is<00:02:58.290> like<00:02:58.739> so<00:02:59.250> little

00:02:59.659 --> 00:02:59.669 
moderate recoil this is like so little

00:02:59.669 --> 00:03:02.929 
moderate recoil this is like so little
recoil<00:03:00.060> even<00:03:00.810> without<00:03:01.200> a<00:03:01.260> grip<00:03:01.650> it<00:03:01.889> can<00:03:02.310> really

00:03:02.929 --> 00:03:02.939 
recoil even without a grip it can really

00:03:02.939 --> 00:03:05.300 
recoil even without a grip it can really
function<00:03:03.269> very<00:03:03.870> well<00:03:03.989> in<00:03:04.470> the<00:03:04.799> longer

00:03:05.300 --> 00:03:05.310 
function very well in the longer

00:03:05.310 --> 00:03:07.580 
function very well in the longer
sightlines<00:03:05.579> and<00:03:06.000> be<00:03:06.689> you<00:03:06.989> know<00:03:07.109> because

00:03:07.580 --> 00:03:07.590 
sightlines and be you know because

00:03:07.590 --> 00:03:10.640 
sightlines and be you know because
there's<00:03:07.799> no<00:03:08.040> way<00:03:08.639> to<00:03:08.669> counteract<00:03:09.269> flinch<00:03:09.750> you

00:03:10.640 --> 00:03:10.650 
there's no way to counteract flinch you

00:03:10.650 --> 00:03:12.920 
there's no way to counteract flinch you
have<00:03:10.889> a<00:03:10.919> gun<00:03:11.310> that<00:03:11.639> shoots<00:03:11.909> fast<00:03:12.209> with<00:03:12.480> 60

00:03:12.920 --> 00:03:12.930 
have a gun that shoots fast with 60

00:03:12.930 --> 00:03:14.360 
have a gun that shoots fast with 60
rounds<00:03:13.260> as<00:03:13.379> soon<00:03:13.590> as<00:03:13.680> you<00:03:13.769> start<00:03:14.010> connecting

00:03:14.360 --> 00:03:14.370 
rounds as soon as you start connecting

00:03:14.370 --> 00:03:16.699 
rounds as soon as you start connecting
some<00:03:14.879> of<00:03:14.909> those<00:03:15.120> rounds<00:03:15.629> if<00:03:15.750> they<00:03:16.230> have<00:03:16.349> a<00:03:16.379> slow

00:03:16.699 --> 00:03:16.709 
some of those rounds if they have a slow

00:03:16.709 --> 00:03:18.259 
some of those rounds if they have a slow
shooting<00:03:17.069> gun<00:03:17.250> there's<00:03:17.519> no<00:03:17.760> way<00:03:18.000> they<00:03:18.209> can

00:03:18.259 --> 00:03:18.269 
shooting gun there's no way they can

00:03:18.269 --> 00:03:20.270 
shooting gun there's no way they can
combat<00:03:18.780> you<00:03:19.019> once<00:03:19.290> they<00:03:19.470> start<00:03:19.769> to<00:03:19.889> get<00:03:20.040> those

combat you once they start to get those

00:03:20.280 --> 00:03:22.939 
combat you once they start to get those
flinch<00:03:20.790> hits<00:03:21.060> because<00:03:21.709> generally<00:03:22.709> light

00:03:22.939 --> 00:03:22.949 
flinch hits because generally light

00:03:22.949 --> 00:03:25.339 
flinch hits because generally light
machine<00:03:23.340> guns<00:03:23.579> in<00:03:23.790> most<00:03:24.000> Call<00:03:24.299> of<00:03:24.329> Duty's<00:03:24.810> have

00:03:25.339 --> 00:03:25.349 
machine guns in most Call of Duty's have

00:03:25.349 --> 00:03:26.839 
machine guns in most Call of Duty's have
been<00:03:25.560> treated<00:03:25.919> like<00:03:26.069> they<00:03:26.250> shoot<00:03:26.579> more

00:03:26.839 --> 00:03:26.849 
been treated like they shoot more

00:03:26.849 --> 00:03:29.509 
been treated like they shoot more
powerful<00:03:27.449> rounds<00:03:27.959> so<00:03:28.319> the<00:03:28.709> flinch<00:03:29.069> on<00:03:29.310> light

00:03:29.509 --> 00:03:29.519 
powerful rounds so the flinch on light

00:03:29.519 --> 00:03:32.030 
powerful rounds so the flinch on light
machine<00:03:29.879> guns<00:03:30.090> is<00:03:30.299> higher<00:03:31.109> than<00:03:31.440> usual<00:03:31.680> in

00:03:32.030 --> 00:03:32.040 
machine guns is higher than usual in

00:03:32.040 --> 00:03:34.189 
machine guns is higher than usual in
past<00:03:32.340> calories<00:03:32.790> we're<00:03:33.239> not<00:03:33.359> sure<00:03:33.569> the<00:03:33.599> exact

00:03:34.189 --> 00:03:34.199
