00:00:04.400 --> 00:00:10.320
 hello and welcome to sap im 

00:00:08.400 --> 00:00:13.380
 Today we want to have a look 

00:00:10.320 --> 00:00:16.440
 how the sony xperia tablet z im 

00:00:13.380 --> 00:00:18.449
 square standard and benchmark like that 

00:00:16.440 --> 00:00:20.340
 Suggests the usual I have that 

00:00:18.449 --> 00:00:22.140
 of course, just rebooted 

00:00:20.340 --> 00:00:23.820
 the room is emptied around us 

00:00:22.140 --> 00:00:25.170
 Of course, no running 

00:00:23.820 --> 00:00:27.000
 applications 

00:00:25.170 --> 00:00:29.010
 I'll just show you that fast 

00:00:27.000 --> 00:00:30.960
 we'll start with the square right away 

00:00:29.010 --> 00:00:33.780
 standard in the most famous 

00:00:30.960 --> 00:00:35.250
 benchmark app for android os after that 

00:00:33.780 --> 00:00:37.079
 was the wrong bank you are wondering 

00:00:35.250 --> 00:00:39.270
 Maybe why I get that 

00:00:37.079 --> 00:00:41.610
 not in landscape mode but in the landscape 

00:00:39.270 --> 00:00:43.920
 portrait fashion lying here have it easy 

00:00:41.610 --> 00:00:45.840
 because the application in the portrait and 

00:00:43.920 --> 00:00:47.879
 not one hundred percent support 

00:00:45.840 --> 00:00:50.460
 and there it is so clear 

00:00:47.879 --> 00:00:53.910
 easier maybe a few words to 

00:00:50.460 --> 00:00:56.640
 hardware of the sony xperia tablet set the 

00:00:53.910 --> 00:00:58.710
 it looks the same as the xperia z 

00:00:56.640 --> 00:01:01.350
 So the current top smartphone of 

00:00:58.710 --> 00:01:04.530
 sony namely the qualcomm snapdragon s4 

00:01:01.350 --> 00:01:07.920
 per one quad core cpu with 1 5 gigahertz 

00:01:04.530 --> 00:01:11.280
 each core as gpu we also have the 

00:01:07.920 --> 00:01:14.400
 adreno 320 a very very potent gpu 

00:01:11.280 --> 00:01:16.500
 he sits, for example, in the snapdragon 600 

00:01:14.400 --> 00:01:19.110
 in it you for example in the htc one 

00:01:16.500 --> 00:01:21.570
 or in samsung galaxy s 4 finds and 

00:01:19.110 --> 00:01:23.909
 We also have two gigabytes of work 

00:01:21.570 --> 00:01:25.920
 So that should be a lot inside 

00:01:23.909 --> 00:01:28.409
 You really are his, too 

00:01:25.920 --> 00:01:29.280
 very nice white worth of the xperia tablet 

00:01:28.409 --> 00:01:32.159
 z seen 

00:01:29.280 --> 00:01:33.720
 yes we are done with this test me 

00:01:32.159 --> 00:01:34.920
 I would say I just look 

00:01:33.720 --> 00:01:36.630
 a little closer 

00:01:34.920 --> 00:01:40.979
 so that you can see that we have 

00:01:36.630 --> 00:01:43.500
 that's 7164 points 

00:01:40.979 --> 00:01:44.460
 quite a very good value 

00:01:43.500 --> 00:01:48.930
 I say 

00:01:44.460 --> 00:01:51.060
 clear that I am the samsung galaxy s 4 

00:01:48.930 --> 00:01:53.040
 or the htc one already have more points 

00:01:51.060 --> 00:01:55.560
 managed significantly more points 

00:01:53.040 --> 00:01:57.570
 but for a tablet with a snapdragon 

00:01:55.560 --> 00:01:59.549
 This is an absolute s4 pro 

00:01:57.570 --> 00:02:01.920
 average value that sonys 

00:01:59.549 --> 00:02:05.369
 not much more 

00:02:01.920 --> 00:02:07.530
 and continue now in the benchmark me 

00:02:05.369 --> 00:02:09.869
 of course the latest version and 

00:02:07.530 --> 00:02:12.060
 click here too start 

00:02:09.869 --> 00:02:14.099
 you know it in the tutu benchmark 

00:02:12.060 --> 00:02:16.049
 always takes a little longer 

00:02:14.099 --> 00:02:18.030
 so maybe I'll tell you a few 

00:02:16.049 --> 00:02:19.440
 words to my first impression of the sony 

00:02:18.030 --> 00:02:22.349
 xperia tablets 

00:02:19.440 --> 00:02:24.060
 yes, of course it is very very subjective 

00:02:22.349 --> 00:02:26.220
 but in my opinion it really is 

00:02:24.060 --> 00:02:28.650
 a very nice tablet I find 

00:02:26.220 --> 00:02:30.540
 the design absolutely brilliant what I still have 

00:02:28.650 --> 00:02:32.519
 The weight is better 

00:02:30.540 --> 00:02:35.069
 really super light I think so 

00:02:32.519 --> 00:02:35.879
 had no 10 inch tablet so 

00:02:35.069 --> 00:02:38.190
 was easy 

00:02:35.879 --> 00:02:39.569
 you really have the feeling here 8 

00:02:38.190 --> 00:02:41.129
 own device 

00:02:39.569 --> 00:02:43.230
 that is of course for the 

00:02:41.129 --> 00:02:45.030
 portability is very good with most 

00:02:43.230 --> 00:02:47.670
 probably her 10 inch tablet sooner 

00:02:45.030 --> 00:02:49.620
 but still use it at home 

00:02:47.670 --> 00:02:51.599
 I like very well what you also 

00:02:49.620 --> 00:02:54.150
 to design must say this back 

00:02:51.599 --> 00:02:56.370
 this rubberized back one software 

00:02:54.150 --> 00:02:58.230
 super grip looks great but pulls 

00:02:56.370 --> 00:02:59.879
 fingerprints really magical on and off 

00:02:58.230 --> 00:03:01.829
 I can tell you she goes too 

00:02:59.879 --> 00:03:03.329
 relatively difficult to clean so with 

00:03:01.829 --> 00:03:03.930
 a microfiber cloth is not there 

00:03:03.329 --> 00:03:06.299
 so far 

00:03:03.930 --> 00:03:08.989
 you usually need some water 

00:03:06.299 --> 00:03:11.430
 or any other liquids 

00:03:08.989 --> 00:03:14.099
 Well that's my first impression of everything 

00:03:11.430 --> 00:03:16.470
 more then of course in the review 

00:03:14.099 --> 00:03:19.319
 So especially on the subject of design processing 

00:03:16.470 --> 00:03:21.870
 and so on that you definitely say 

00:03:19.319 --> 00:03:24.599
 , the display is absolutely awesome it 

00:03:21.870 --> 00:03:26.459
 is very keen is very bright and god 

00:03:24.599 --> 00:03:29.400
 Thankfully, it is clear angle 

00:03:26.459 --> 00:03:31.049
 have more stable than sony smartphones 

00:03:29.400 --> 00:03:32.940
 I really did not think so but the display 

00:03:31.049 --> 00:03:35.250
 that was installed here or 

00:03:32.940 --> 00:03:38.489
 The panel is really very nice 

00:03:35.250 --> 00:03:41.010
 and very very good, which is still easy 

00:03:38.489 --> 00:03:41.579
 disturbs the sony xperia tablet z is the 

00:03:41.010 --> 00:03:43.590
 frame 

00:03:41.579 --> 00:03:46.650
 It looks like this is already the frame 

00:03:43.590 --> 00:03:47.849
 both here and here pretty thick 

00:03:46.650 --> 00:03:50.489
 Of course you can argue 

00:03:47.849 --> 00:03:52.769
 and say at a 10 inch device is 

00:03:50.489 --> 00:03:54.569
 that is great can hold better 

00:03:52.769 --> 00:03:57.389
 but I find it here at the side 

00:03:54.569 --> 00:03:57.989
 you would have to make the frame a little thinner 

00:03:57.389 --> 00:04:00.599
 can 

00:03:57.989 --> 00:04:02.489
 It does not have to be completely gone but you 

00:04:00.599 --> 00:04:04.919
 it could just make it a little thinner 

00:04:02.489 --> 00:04:06.959
 can clear if the device is locked 

00:04:04.919 --> 00:04:08.669
 It looks absolutely great because you're not 

00:04:06.959 --> 00:04:10.829
 display looks like it acts like a 

00:04:08.669 --> 00:04:13.260
 completely black layer that looks then 

00:04:10.829 --> 00:04:15.299
 very nice but just if that 

00:04:13.260 --> 00:04:17.190
 display is then on is something is 

00:04:15.299 --> 00:04:20.099
 penetrating I find that disturbs the design 

00:04:17.190 --> 00:04:21.659
 something but well he has that is 

00:04:20.099 --> 00:04:22.170
 a matter of taste many may like 

00:04:21.659 --> 00:04:23.670
 say 

00:04:22.170 --> 00:04:26.700
 that they really like it 

00:04:23.670 --> 00:04:29.250
 that the frame is as wide as it is 

00:04:26.700 --> 00:04:31.170
 I'm really very excited about the display 

00:04:29.250 --> 00:04:33.150
 very surprised I hope you can the 

00:04:31.170 --> 00:04:35.880
 now also recognize a little here 

00:04:33.150 --> 00:04:39.300
 benchmark the colors are really great 

00:04:35.880 --> 00:04:40.680
 very intense the contrast values ​​can there 

00:04:39.300 --> 00:04:42.210
 you really are not really at all 

00:04:40.680 --> 00:04:44.970
 and above all, I would complain 

00:04:42.210 --> 00:04:47.580
 not at all expected for that 

00:04:44.970 --> 00:04:50.220
 xperia z got me slightly annoyed when 

00:04:47.580 --> 00:04:52.080
 you had the wrong version with the 

00:04:50.220 --> 00:04:53.460
 poor viewing angle stability though 

00:04:52.080 --> 00:04:55.200
 Well, that's not here anymore 

00:04:53.460 --> 00:04:55.920
 the case because sony has a good job 

00:04:55.200 --> 00:04:57.930
 done 

00:04:55.920 --> 00:05:00.090
 while youtube benchmark is done and 

00:04:57.930 --> 00:05:01.440
 Let's see how many points we have 

00:05:00.090 --> 00:05:03.570
 have done here 

00:05:01.440 --> 00:05:05.640
 I go down again and zoom 

00:05:03.570 --> 00:05:07.740
 Here's something for you to look like this 

00:05:05.640 --> 00:05:11.240
 I could tell you it is one 

00:05:07.740 --> 00:05:14.640
 decent value we have 20,000 here 

00:05:11.240 --> 00:05:17.370
 369 points is not an apex but for 

00:05:14.640 --> 00:05:20.790
 the qualcomm snapdragon s4 per one 

00:05:17.370 --> 00:05:23.310
 absolutely normal typical value what can 

00:05:20.790 --> 00:05:25.590
 one concludes saying yes almost like that 

00:05:23.310 --> 00:05:28.020
 every other device with the snapdragon s4 

00:05:25.590 --> 00:05:30.780
 pro also has the xperia tablet 

00:05:28.020 --> 00:05:31.470
 absolutely brave in the other benchmarks 

00:05:30.780 --> 00:05:33.600
 beaten 

00:05:31.470 --> 00:05:35.640
 in this sense, of course, I hope like 

00:05:33.600 --> 00:05:37.560
 always the video you liked with 

00:05:35.640 --> 00:05:40.850
 nice to watch and say 

00:05:37.560 --> 00:05:40.850
 until next time
