actual card reading step
first<00:01:18.180> of<00:01:18.330> all<00:01:18.450> run<00:01:19.320> the<00:01:19.350> program<00:01:20.689> you<00:01:21.689> have<00:01:21.900> to

00:01:22.010 --> 00:01:22.020 
first of all run the program you have to

00:01:22.020 --> 00:01:23.800 
first of all run the program you have to
make<00:01:22.140> sure<00:01:22.170> that<00:01:22.320> the<00:01:22.560> card<00:01:22.770> is<00:01:22.860> plugged<00:01:23.159> in

00:01:51.620 --> 00:01:51.630 

00:01:51.630 --> 00:01:55.230 

most<00:01:52.630> of<00:01:52.780> us<00:01:52.929> think<00:01:53.439> that<00:01:54.130> once<00:01:54.399> an<00:01:54.579> SMS<00:01:55.060> was

00:01:55.230 --> 00:01:55.240 
most of us think that once an SMS was

00:01:55.240 --> 00:01:58.260 
most of us think that once an SMS was
deleted<00:01:55.689> it<00:01:56.469> cannot<00:01:56.979> be<00:01:57.100> recovered<00:01:57.399> and<00:01:58.149> has

00:01:58.260 --> 00:01:58.270 
deleted it cannot be recovered and has

00:01:58.270 --> 00:02:01.080 
deleted it cannot be recovered and has
gone<00:01:58.509> forever<00:01:59.009> but<00:02:00.009> in<00:02:00.159> reality<00:02:00.369> things<00:02:00.939> are

00:02:01.080 --> 00:02:01.090 
gone forever but in reality things are

00:02:01.090 --> 00:02:03.809 
gone forever but in reality things are
slightly<00:02:01.390> different<00:02:01.630> it<00:02:02.439> turns<00:02:02.740> out<00:02:03.009> that<00:02:03.670> an

00:02:03.809 --> 00:02:03.819 
slightly different it turns out that an

slightly different it turns out that an
SMS<00:02:04.270> is<00:02:04.420> only<00:02:04.659> marked<00:02:05.049> as<00:02:05.200> deleted<00:02:05.709> and<00:02:05.859> not

so<00:05:18.430> we<00:05:18.610> went<00:05:18.820> back<00:05:18.880> to<00:05:19.120> the<00:05:19.210> SMS<00:05:19.690> archive<00:05:20.280> part

00:05:21.270 --> 00:05:21.280 
so we went back to the SMS archive part

00:05:21.280 --> 00:05:24.360 
so we went back to the SMS archive part
of<00:05:21.400> the<00:05:21.490> SIM<00:05:21.669> card<00:05:21.699> and<00:05:22.590> now<00:05:23.590> you<00:05:23.650> can<00:05:23.889> see<00:05:24.100> that

00:05:24.360 --> 00:05:24.370 
of the SIM card and now you can see that

00:05:24.370 --> 00:05:26.400 
of the SIM card and now you can see that
the<00:05:24.669> two<00:05:25.150> messages<00:05:25.330> which<00:05:25.810> were<00:05:25.840> marked<00:05:26.320> as

00:05:26.400 --> 00:05:26.410 
the two messages which were marked as

00:05:26.410 --> 00:05:29.490 
the two messages which were marked as
undiluted<00:05:26.919> are<00:05:27.220> now<00:05:27.370> there<00:05:27.669> as<00:05:28.540> normal

00:05:29.490 --> 00:05:29.500 
undiluted are now there as normal

00:05:29.500 --> 00:05:31.680 
undiluted are now there as normal
messages<00:05:29.919> well<00:05:30.669> the<00:05:30.850> ones<00:05:31.030> which<00:05:31.240> were<00:05:31.419> wiped

00:05:31.680 --> 00:05:31.690 
messages well the ones which were wiped

00:05:31.690 --> 00:05:34.219 
messages well the ones which were wiped
are<00:05:32.440> completely<00:05:33.310> gone

00:05:34.219 --> 00:05:34.229 
are completely gone

00:05:34.229 --> 00:05:37.350 
are completely gone
in<00:05:35.229> other<00:05:35.380> words<00:05:35.650> sim<00:05:36.190> manager<00:05:36.610> allows<00:05:37.000> you<00:05:37.210> to

in other words sim manager allows you to

00:05:37.360 --> 00:05:40.560 
in other words sim manager allows you to

from a SIM card or it allows you to

00:05:42.760 --> 00:05:46.260 
from a SIM card or it allows you to
