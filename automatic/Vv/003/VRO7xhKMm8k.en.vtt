00:00:12.530 --> 00:00:17.160
 i 

00:00:15.150 --> 00:00:18.840
 hello how about friends welcome to zone 

00:00:17.160 --> 00:00:22.529
 ghost I am phantom and I am going to 

00:00:18.840 --> 00:00:26.490
 teach how to install the lumen and air 

00:00:22.529 --> 00:00:29.430
 hms for version 1.5 and for those who 

00:00:26.490 --> 00:00:30.960
 they have windows 8 that are complicated 

00:00:29.430 --> 00:00:33.780
 a little bit, so I'm going to show you how 

00:00:30.960 --> 00:00:35.280
 install it in this version then what 

00:00:33.780 --> 00:00:36.750
 first thing they're going to do is go to the 

00:00:35.280 --> 00:00:39.120
 description of this video I leave the 

00:00:36.750 --> 00:00:41.760
 link so they can go to is the page 

00:00:39.120 --> 00:00:44.129
 where is the tumen james download it 

00:00:41.760 --> 00:00:45.660
 they will click where it says download and 

00:00:44.129 --> 00:00:47.670
 this page is going to come out then 

00:00:45.660 --> 00:00:50.820
 when on this page they will wait 

00:00:47.670 --> 00:00:52.530
 about 5 seconds here where is this 

00:00:50.820 --> 00:00:55.860
 counting at the top they're going to 

00:00:52.530 --> 00:00:58.229
 click on dodge and they will download it 

00:00:55.860 --> 00:01:00.960
 then after they download it they go 

00:00:58.229 --> 00:01:02.839
 to flee to open it with the winrar and they leave 

00:01:00.960 --> 00:01:06.479
 to go down here on the left where it says 

00:01:02.839 --> 00:01:08.580
 run you are going to click right there to 

00:01:06.479 --> 00:01:12.930
 let them see that and they will write 

00:01:08.580 --> 00:01:14.640
 the app percentage percentage percentage will 

00:01:12.930 --> 00:01:17.220
 that window comes out and they double click 

00:01:14.640 --> 00:01:20.460
 where it says minecraft then they will give 

00:01:17.220 --> 00:01:23.159
 the double click where it says bean 

00:01:20.460 --> 00:01:26.159
 and here where minecraft says they're going to 

00:01:23.159 --> 00:01:28.619
 open with winrar after opening it with 

00:01:26.159 --> 00:01:30.090
 winrar they are going to go they are going to be given 

00:01:28.619 --> 00:01:32.610
 account can already close that window it 

00:01:30.090 --> 00:01:35.369
 they are going to realize that there is a folder 

00:01:32.610 --> 00:01:37.740
 which says meta and pnv then what are they going 

00:01:35.369 --> 00:01:39.690
 to do is that they are going to erase it or 

00:01:37.740 --> 00:01:40.170
 erase that's why it works well 

00:01:39.690 --> 00:01:42.659
 the mod 

00:01:40.170 --> 00:01:44.630
 so it is very important that they erase it 

00:01:42.659 --> 00:01:47.550
 every time they are going to install the mode 

00:01:44.630 --> 00:01:49.470
 Logically, it only comes out once 

00:01:47.550 --> 00:01:52.110
 after each update of 

00:01:49.470 --> 00:01:53.970
 minecraft then if you erased it for 

00:01:52.110 --> 00:01:57.259
 the next time you install a mode already 

00:01:53.970 --> 00:02:00.210
 it's not going to come out but well you go to the 

00:01:57.259 --> 00:02:02.640
 winrar where is the tumen and also you go 

00:02:00.210 --> 00:02:05.940
 to select everything and this you're going to 

00:02:02.640 --> 00:02:08.940
 copy and you will paste it here where it is 

00:02:05.940 --> 00:02:12.600
 this other folder then stick it here 

00:02:08.940 --> 00:02:13.950
 you give ok and that's it then that's it 

00:02:12.600 --> 00:02:16.680
 what you have to do to install it 

00:02:13.950 --> 00:02:18.630
 you can close your windows and you can 

00:02:16.680 --> 00:02:20.700
 open the minecraft then I'm going to open 

00:02:18.630 --> 00:02:23.280
 minecraft so they can see that it's already 

00:02:20.700 --> 00:02:26.250
 installed this version 1.5 in the 

00:02:23.280 --> 00:02:28.280
 last one that has come out and well we are going to 

00:02:26.250 --> 00:02:31.050
 that everything is working perfectly 

00:02:28.280 --> 00:02:34.200

00:02:31.050 --> 00:02:35.280
