00:00:00.280 --> 00:00:04.720
 good today we are going to prepare a rich and 

00:00:02.620 --> 00:00:06.730
 healthy recipe with fruits in shades 

00:00:04.720 --> 00:00:08.980
 reddish with a very special touch 

00:00:06.730 --> 00:00:10.809
 red wine that makes this dessert of 

00:00:08.980 --> 00:00:13.509
 fruit remembers sangria 

00:00:10.809 --> 00:00:15.549
 It is ideal for hot days can 

00:00:13.509 --> 00:00:17.310
 be refreshing it hydrates and it's nothing 

00:00:15.549 --> 00:00:20.050
 heavy 

00:00:17.310 --> 00:00:22.210
 As you can see I have picked fruits in shades 

00:00:20.050 --> 00:00:24.130
 reddish and yellowish so that they stick 

00:00:22.210 --> 00:00:26.280
 with the tonality of the wine that thus remains 

00:00:24.130 --> 00:00:28.420
 everything more homogeneous and beautiful 

00:00:26.280 --> 00:00:30.610
 we will start making the broth that 

00:00:28.420 --> 00:00:33.280
 will accompany our fruit for that 

00:00:30.610 --> 00:00:34.839
 We crush watermelon to make it more 

00:00:33.280 --> 00:00:37.179
 light we will strain it 

00:00:34.839 --> 00:00:41.800
 in this way we will remove the fiber and the 

00:00:37.179 --> 00:00:44.440
 nuggets and in this trick 

00:00:41.800 --> 00:00:46.839
 next we add a glass 

00:00:44.440 --> 00:00:48.969
 generous red wine we tried it and 

00:00:46.839 --> 00:00:50.800
 we put sugar to taste I put about 6 

00:00:48.969 --> 00:00:53.050
 spoonfuls presto will depend on the 

00:00:50.800 --> 00:00:55.420
 sweetness of watermelon and what vinotinto 

00:00:53.050 --> 00:00:56.590
 let's use we reserve in the fridge so that 

00:00:55.420 --> 00:00:59.440
 cool 

00:00:56.590 --> 00:01:02.020
 Now it's time to arm yourself with patience and cut 

00:00:59.440 --> 00:01:03.790
 all the fruits I put it with skin 

00:01:02.020 --> 00:01:06.100
 because I like it but you can take it off 

00:01:03.790 --> 00:01:09.190
 if you want that, it is important 

00:01:06.100 --> 00:01:11.290
 clean it very well so that it is more 

00:01:09.190 --> 00:01:14.820
 nice I recommend you cut all the 

00:01:11.290 --> 00:01:14.820
 fruit about the same size 

00:01:21.450 --> 00:01:27.670
 and all the fruit we are going to put 

00:01:24.340 --> 00:01:29.590
 together in a bowl has been used any 

00:01:27.670 --> 00:01:32.020
 fruit that oxidizes but if you use any 

00:01:29.590 --> 00:01:33.790
 as is the banana or the apple os 

00:01:32.020 --> 00:01:37.440
 I recommend putting a little trickle on top 

00:01:33.790 --> 00:01:37.440
 of lemon so it does not stay out 

00:01:38.850 --> 00:01:44.800
 stir to mix all the 

00:01:41.500 --> 00:01:47.590
 fruits and so now for a little sugar 

00:01:44.800 --> 00:01:49.690
 brown to taste and you can also add 

00:01:47.590 --> 00:01:51.250
 a few chopped mint leaves that what 

00:01:49.690 --> 00:01:54.190
 will do is enhance the flavor of the fruit 

00:01:51.250 --> 00:01:56.460
 give a fresh and aromatic touch and 

00:01:54.190 --> 00:01:59.700
 it is delicious 

00:01:56.460 --> 00:02:02.860
 all that remains is to serve our fruit and 

00:01:59.700 --> 00:02:05.170
 add a bit of our broth 

00:02:02.860 --> 00:02:07.900
 decorate with more sales and it would be 

00:02:05.170 --> 00:02:09.850
 ready for you to gain flavor and be more 

00:02:07.900 --> 00:02:11.650
 I recommend you to mix the fruit 

00:02:09.850 --> 00:02:13.870
 with the broth and leave it in the fridge 

00:02:11.650 --> 00:02:17.590
 At least 24 hours this will give you more 

00:02:13.870 --> 00:02:19.600
 flavor and more color and it will be delicious not 

00:02:17.590 --> 00:02:21.100

00:02:21.100 --> 00:02:24.090
